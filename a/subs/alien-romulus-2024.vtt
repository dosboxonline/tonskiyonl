WEBVTT

05:18.792 --> 05:22.083
Attention all workers. Attention all workers.

05:22.250 --> 05:25.375
Day shift starting in T-minus 15 minutes.

05:25.542 --> 05:28.167
Farmers to report to mess hall immediately.

05:29.083 --> 05:32.333
If you are experiencing any symptoms,
such as fever, cough…

05:32.500 --> 05:34.417
vomiting, or difficulty breathing…

05:34.583 --> 05:37.000
proceed to the medical bay
for examination.

05:38.583 --> 05:43.542
The safety and well-being of our colony
is Weyland-Yutani's top priority.

05:44.375 --> 05:46.083
Attention all workers…

05:46.250 --> 05:49.125
Did you hear about
the claustrophobic astronaut?

05:49.708 --> 05:50.708
He needed space.

05:50.875 --> 05:52.583
I'm begging you, you got to stop.

05:52.750 --> 05:56.292
I just spent my full share
on a belt that won't fit.

05:56.750 --> 05:58.000
Huge waist.

05:58.208 --> 05:59.250
See that cornbread.

06:02.042 --> 06:04.417
Maybe it's 'cause I'm on this seafood diet.

06:04.958 --> 06:06.792
I see food, I eat it.

06:08.208 --> 06:09.625
That's so bad.

06:09.792 --> 06:11.208
You always laughed at that one.

06:11.375 --> 06:12.833
Yeah, when I was 12.

06:17.542 --> 06:19.167
I'm sure it's Mr. Finch.

06:20.167 --> 06:21.792
We owe him three months today.

06:23.125 --> 06:24.500
He'll call again.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.667
Well, maybe we won't be here when he does.

06:36.750 --> 06:38.667
Andy. Stay close to me.

06:41.625 --> 06:44.042
Wake up. Wake up now.

06:44.792 --> 06:47.250
We're all Weyland-Yutani slaves.

06:47.333 --> 06:52.708
The company pays us with food and shelter
and takes our lives in exchange.

06:52.875 --> 06:55.083
Don't believe their lies.

06:55.708 --> 06:57.208
They own you!

06:58.000 --> 06:59.542
Andy, Andy. Hey, hey, hey.

06:59.708 --> 07:01.042
Hey, Andy. Come on. Come on.

07:02.917 --> 07:04.917
-What did I do?
-It's a scam.

07:05.083 --> 07:06.667
The ball is never under the cup
that you pick.

07:06.833 --> 07:07.667
It's a trick.

07:07.833 --> 07:10.208
But how am I gonna get the money?

07:10.583 --> 07:11.583
Money for what?

07:11.750 --> 07:15.542
To pay for the horse when we get to Yvaga.

07:15.708 --> 07:17.458
You're gonna get a horse?

07:17.625 --> 07:20.125
I wanna call it Raindy.

07:21.333 --> 07:22.917
Do you get it?

07:23.750 --> 07:27.042
-Raindy.
-No, I like it. Yeah, it's good.

07:28.417 --> 07:31.208
Okay, so you just wait over there.

07:31.375 --> 07:32.583
Okay, I might be a minute.

07:34.208 --> 07:35.708
Stay out of trouble, all right?

07:35.875 --> 07:38.667
All employees will be seen.

07:38.833 --> 07:40.000
Good luck.

07:40.167 --> 07:42.375
Line up in an orderly fashion.

07:42.542 --> 07:43.833
Next.

07:44.000 --> 07:45.792
Full name and occupation, please.

07:45.958 --> 07:49.208
Marie Raines Carradine, ma'am. Farming.

07:49.375 --> 07:50.583
It's about my travel papers.

07:51.708 --> 07:54.250
I met my quota,
and I should be free to go now.

07:54.667 --> 07:55.708
Right?

07:55.875 --> 07:57.083
Go where?

07:57.250 --> 07:58.417
Yvaga.

07:59.042 --> 08:02.042
It's an independent system,
but it's fully terraformed.

08:03.208 --> 08:05.125
You can actually see the sun out there.

08:05.292 --> 08:06.667
Where are your parents?

08:08.250 --> 08:10.792
They died three cycles ago.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.000
Lung disease, from the mines.

08:13.917 --> 08:15.458
It's just me and my brother now.

08:16.625 --> 08:19.167
They sell us hope to keep us slaves.

08:19.875 --> 08:25.542
They sell us hope to keep us slaves.
Wake up now.

08:36.832 --> 08:39.707
I'm sorry, but you're not eligible
for contract release yet.

08:39.875 --> 08:42.375
Due to a shortage of workers,
you're being transferred to the mines.

08:42.542 --> 08:43.832
Wait, what?

08:44.458 --> 08:46.500
No, no, no, I reached the required hours.

08:46.667 --> 08:47.917
You have to let me go.

08:48.125 --> 08:50.917
Unfortunately, quotas have been raised
to 24,000 hours…

08:51.083 --> 08:53.875
so you'll be released from contract
in another five to six years.

08:54.042 --> 08:56.000
Thank you, and remember
the company is really grateful…

08:56.167 --> 08:57.375
for your ongoing service.

08:57.708 --> 08:59.833
-Rain!
-Hey!

09:00.000 --> 09:01.083
Hey, stop!

09:01.250 --> 09:03.292
Get off him! You bastards!

09:05.708 --> 09:06.792
I got you, I got you.

09:07.250 --> 09:08.208
Shit, you're bleeding.

09:11.000 --> 09:12.042
Okay.

09:14.583 --> 09:15.625
You're okay.

09:15.792 --> 09:17.125
I'm resetting you.

09:17.458 --> 09:18.458
I got you.

09:21.083 --> 09:22.250
It's okay.

09:22.417 --> 09:23.833
I shouldn't have left you alone.

09:29.375 --> 09:32.875
They sell us hope to keep us slaves.

09:33.042 --> 09:35.083
Wake up now. They own you.

09:38.375 --> 09:39.208
Hi, Rain.

09:39.375 --> 09:41.042
Look, I'm sorry. I know I've been calling you
all day…

09:41.208 --> 09:44.292
but, look, something's come up,
and I think you should know about it.

09:44.458 --> 09:47.000
So, come by the trailers and bring Andy.

10:17.292 --> 10:18.292
Hey.

10:19.542 --> 10:20.417
Oh, for…

10:20.583 --> 10:22.000
Game over, man.

10:22.542 --> 10:25.083
Sup, Rain? Long time no see.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.042
I told you she'd show up.

10:27.792 --> 10:29.000
You owe me five bucks.

10:30.208 --> 10:31.333
Andy!

10:34.250 --> 10:36.292
Why'd the blind miner fall down the well?

10:36.458 --> 10:37.792
Why?

10:39.708 --> 10:40.792
'Cause he couldn't see that well.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.333
Please don't encourage him.

10:44.083 --> 10:46.000
All right, go inside.
I'll be there in a second.

10:52.042 --> 10:53.333
-Kay.
-Rain.

10:53.500 --> 10:54.542
-Hi.
-Hi!

10:54.708 --> 10:55.792
Hi.

10:56.708 --> 10:58.500
I missed you.

10:58.667 --> 11:00.500
And I know my brother missed you, too.

11:05.208 --> 11:07.083
I'm really glad you came.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.583
I heard about your dad.

11:10.750 --> 11:11.750
I'm really sorry.

11:12.542 --> 11:15.792
Well, between the hailstorms
and the new diseases every cycle…

11:15.958 --> 11:17.500
Yeah, everybody's dying, right?

11:17.708 --> 11:19.333
So, should we show her?

11:19.833 --> 11:21.208
Show me what?

11:22.000 --> 11:25.958
Okay, so, last night, we're loading up
the last Tesotek…

11:26.125 --> 11:28.708
we're about 200 miles above the ground,
and then all of a sudden…

11:30.583 --> 11:31.958
The hauler picks up this beacon.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.125
So Navarro tracks it, and it turns out…

11:34.292 --> 11:37.208
there's this big Wey-Yu ship
drifting right above our heads.

11:37.375 --> 11:38.250
Drifting?

11:38.417 --> 11:40.042
Decommissioned. Abandoned.

11:40.208 --> 11:42.167
Some old relic.
It's probably damaged or obsolete.

11:42.333 --> 11:43.542
Like that guy over there.

11:43.708 --> 11:44.708
Bjorn.

11:46.042 --> 11:48.250
Okay, just tell her.

11:48.417 --> 11:50.000
Why are we all sitting around here…

11:50.167 --> 11:53.500
waiting for travel permits that the company
are never gonna give to us?

11:54.042 --> 11:56.083
'Cause that hauler has enough power in it
to get us to Yvaga.

11:56.250 --> 11:59.042
Because it takes nine years
to get to Yvaga…

11:59.208 --> 12:01.292
and you can't make that trip
without cryo-sleep.

12:01.458 --> 12:04.042
Decommissioned ships still carry
tons of functional equipment.

12:04.208 --> 12:07.542
And the hyperlink shows
that ship still has a few pods left.

12:11.375 --> 12:17.167
You want to break into a Weyland-Yutani ship
and steal highly regulated equipment?

12:17.333 --> 12:18.542
Before someone else does.

12:20.458 --> 12:21.667
You guys are insane.

12:21.833 --> 12:22.958
-Well, of course we are.
-No. No, we're not.

12:23.125 --> 12:24.333
-This is…
-That's what I said.

12:24.500 --> 12:25.708
Are you gonna help us?

12:28.125 --> 12:29.917
Sorry, what do you need me for?

12:32.083 --> 12:33.083
Andy.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.167
-We need to use Andy.
-Andy?

12:35.333 --> 12:36.167
Mm-hmm.

12:36.333 --> 12:39.083
He's a Weyland-Yutani synthetic.
He speaks Mother.

12:39.250 --> 12:42.208
He can access a terminal on the ship
to get us in and out without a fuss.

12:42.375 --> 12:43.625
It's the only way to get in.

12:43.792 --> 12:45.875
Okay, but what if we get caught?

12:46.042 --> 12:48.500
It'll ruin our chances of ever getting
a travel permit.

12:48.667 --> 12:50.208
Right, Rain's not comin'.

12:51.208 --> 12:52.625
How about you let us take Andy then?

12:53.417 --> 12:55.792
I'm not sending my brother up there alone.

12:56.542 --> 12:57.667
He's not your brother though, is he?

12:57.833 --> 12:59.875
-Bjorn, shut the fuck up.
-It's true, though, isn't it?

13:00.042 --> 13:01.292
He's not your brother.
It's just Wey-Yu damaged goods…

13:01.458 --> 13:02.917
that your dad found in the trash.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.000
And that's all he is, Rain.
So just wake up.

13:06.000 --> 13:06.833
Let's go.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.583
-Rain?
-What? I didn't say anything.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.083
Rain, wait.

13:10.875 --> 13:13.000
I'm sorry. Listen, I know my cousin can be a
dick sometimes, all right?

13:13.167 --> 13:14.833
But he is right about something.

13:15.542 --> 13:16.542
You need to wake up.

13:16.958 --> 13:19.042
Because this company,
they're not gonna give us anything.

13:19.208 --> 13:21.208
You know that as well as I do.
We have to take it.

13:25.417 --> 13:26.458
Rain, I just…

13:27.250 --> 13:29.000
I don't want to end up like our parents.

13:29.750 --> 13:30.958
Do you?

13:36.000 --> 13:39.500
Is it as easy as you're making it sound,
this plan of yours?

13:40.500 --> 13:42.417
You won't even have to get out
of the Corbelan.

13:42.833 --> 13:44.542
That much I can promise you, okay?

13:48.667 --> 13:50.125
Come on. What do you say?

14:14.458 --> 14:16.000
Bjorn, hurry up, let's go.

14:20.167 --> 14:23.042
All right, I'm starting her up. Batteries on.

14:25.542 --> 14:26.542
Lovely.

14:28.333 --> 14:29.625
Could I get hydro, please?

14:30.792 --> 14:31.792
Comm panel.

14:33.792 --> 14:34.833
Ground spoilers.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.083
They are armed.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.167
First time in space, huh?

14:38.333 --> 14:39.333
Yeah.

14:40.625 --> 14:41.625
You too?

14:43.042 --> 14:44.042
Fuel pump.

14:44.208 --> 14:46.125
-On.
-Two space virgins coming through.

14:46.458 --> 14:48.625
Right, take a good look outside the window…

14:48.792 --> 14:50.875
'cause the way I see it,
we're never coming back.

15:04.250 --> 15:05.292
You good?

15:05.458 --> 15:06.458
I'm good.

15:07.458 --> 15:08.458
Yeah. It's gonna be all right.

15:27.875 --> 15:29.250
Are you sure this is a good idea now?

15:29.417 --> 15:30.500
Sure, Dad.

15:36.125 --> 15:37.208
Here comes the crush.

15:56.375 --> 15:57.750
That's how it's done, bitch.

16:53.958 --> 16:54.833
Is that…

16:56.750 --> 16:58.000
Yeah.

16:58.167 --> 16:59.833
That is our sun.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.666
They say Yvaga has the most
incredible sunsets.

17:14.833 --> 17:16.250
I've seen them.

17:19.166 --> 17:20.291
In my dreams.

17:21.250 --> 17:23.250
I can't wait to see them with you.

17:26.708 --> 17:27.708
Yeah.

17:30.792 --> 17:32.625
You know, I heard that cryo-sleep
just makes years…

17:32.792 --> 17:34.333
feel like one night
of heavy drinkin' apparently.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.542
So when we wake up in Yvaga tomorrow…

17:37.625 --> 17:39.125
we'll wake up with a hangover.

17:48.417 --> 17:49.542
There she is.

17:51.875 --> 17:53.250
That's not a ship.

17:53.625 --> 17:54.833
No.

17:55.833 --> 17:57.583
Fuck, that's big. What is that?

17:57.750 --> 17:59.750
Decommissioned outpost? I don't know.

17:59.917 --> 18:01.333
Probably got dragged into our orbit.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.417
Okay, Navarro, let's get closer, please.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.625
Okay. I'm gonna match its roll.

18:21.875 --> 18:24.708
Hazard proximity alert.

18:26.000 --> 18:26.875
What's wrong?

18:27.042 --> 18:29.458
It's just the belt's a bit closer
than I thought.

18:31.375 --> 18:32.375
How long?

18:33.917 --> 18:35.583
It's 36 hours, give or take.

18:35.750 --> 18:36.625
Till what?

18:36.792 --> 18:39.542
Before the station crashes against the rings.

18:39.708 --> 18:40.875
Sorry, what?

18:41.792 --> 18:43.958
What did you just say?
That doesn't sound very good.

18:44.125 --> 18:45.250
36 hours.

18:45.417 --> 18:47.000
We should be in and out in 30 minutes.

18:47.958 --> 18:48.958
Yeah?

18:49.583 --> 18:50.417
Andy.

18:50.583 --> 18:51.500
Yeah, tops.

18:52.208 --> 18:54.458
Are you sure you wanna do this?

18:55.583 --> 18:57.792
I have just one directive.

18:58.333 --> 19:00.125
To do what's best for Rain.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.042
Your dad wrote it.

19:03.708 --> 19:04.708
Yeah.

19:05.792 --> 19:07.458
That and too many dad jokes.

19:07.625 --> 19:09.000
I'm happy…

19:09.917 --> 19:11.083
to help.

19:16.167 --> 19:17.667
Be careful out there.

19:33.792 --> 19:35.542
Okay, hurry up.
We're docking in two minutes.

19:38.000 --> 19:39.042
Put that on.

19:39.208 --> 19:40.708
Now, why I gotta put this on for?

19:40.875 --> 19:42.167
So you don't freeze your balls off.

19:42.333 --> 19:44.875
Mate, you gotta stop obsessing
about my balls, man. It's unhealthy.

19:45.042 --> 19:46.292
Keep talking and I'll chop 'em off.

19:46.458 --> 19:48.292
Aw, you really want 'em for yourself,
don't you?

19:48.458 --> 19:49.667
Hey, you want me to show you
my balls or something?

19:49.833 --> 19:50.958
Oh, shut up a minute.

19:51.125 --> 19:52.500
Gloves, here, take these.

19:53.083 --> 19:55.375
Hey! No.
Stop touching shit.

19:55.542 --> 19:57.750
-Come over here.
-Bjorn, leave him alone, for fuck's sake.

19:58.875 --> 19:59.958
Andy, take no notice.

20:00.125 --> 20:02.125
All right, okay, won't be my fault
when he breaks somethin'.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.250
There's a synth hatch right ahead.
I'm gonna dock.

20:12.417 --> 20:13.958
Copy that. Just bring us in slow.

20:40.958 --> 20:42.417
Oh, fuck me, it's cold in there.

20:43.333 --> 20:44.167
What's that?

20:44.500 --> 20:45.875
It's a temp-scanner.

20:46.750 --> 20:48.292
It's gonna lead us to the pods.

20:50.708 --> 20:52.583
Okay, compression is good enough.

20:52.750 --> 20:54.875
Oxygen is too thin to breathe.

20:55.042 --> 20:55.875
Andy…

20:56.333 --> 20:57.167
you're up.

20:57.667 --> 20:59.000
It's your time to shine.

21:05.042 --> 21:06.708
Yes! Andy!

21:06.875 --> 21:07.958
Beautiful work.

21:08.375 --> 21:09.333
Okay.

21:11.250 --> 21:13.000
Congrats. You're not a virgin anymore.

21:14.375 --> 21:15.208
All right.

21:25.875 --> 21:27.125
Okay, let's go.

21:59.583 --> 22:00.417
Fuck.

22:00.583 --> 22:02.417
Guys, it looks like we're in zero-g.

22:02.833 --> 22:04.458
Yeah, I can feel it in my stomach.

22:09.958 --> 22:10.958
Wait, what's that?

22:11.125 --> 22:12.417
Gravity generators.

22:12.625 --> 22:15.125
When offline, they still purge themselves
every few minutes.

22:15.417 --> 22:17.292
Prevents the place from blowing up.

22:21.292 --> 22:23.417
Oh, fuck me, there goes my stomach again.

22:24.375 --> 22:25.708
Okay, straight ahead.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.500
According to the scanner,
the pods should be in here.

23:34.208 --> 23:35.208
Jesus.

23:35.625 --> 23:36.917
Andy, you good?

23:37.083 --> 23:38.000
Yeah.

23:44.333 --> 23:47.000
All right, great news.
I've got eyes on the pods.

23:51.833 --> 23:52.667
Fuck!

23:56.167 --> 23:57.000
Bjorn, you okay?

23:57.958 --> 23:59.000
Fuck!

23:59.708 --> 24:01.542
I think I fractured my asshole.

24:06.375 --> 24:08.875
Fuckin' hell.
Don't fuck with this gravity purge, man.

24:24.667 --> 24:27.000
Thank God, there's still some power left
in this relic.

24:43.083 --> 24:45.042
Okay, watch out. Gravity's coming back.

24:46.917 --> 24:48.167
Fuckin' hell.

24:54.917 --> 24:56.375
All right, here we go.

24:56.833 --> 24:58.000
Let's see what we got.

24:59.250 --> 25:00.208
Okay.

25:04.958 --> 25:05.792
Shit.

25:05.958 --> 25:07.083
What's the problem?

25:07.833 --> 25:08.833
Pods don't have enough fuel.

25:09.333 --> 25:10.167
What do you mean?

25:10.333 --> 25:12.292
They're loaded up for three years in stasis.

25:12.458 --> 25:14.125
Yeah, but it takes nine years
to get to Yvaga, mate.

25:14.292 --> 25:16.375
Yeah, I know, I know. I'm aware of that.

25:16.542 --> 25:17.875
Fuckin' hell.

25:18.042 --> 25:19.292
I knew it. I fuckin' knew it.

25:19.458 --> 25:20.458
-I knew it.
-Just relax.

25:20.625 --> 25:21.708
Maybe you guys should just come back.

25:21.875 --> 25:23.000
No, no, we're not givin' up now.

25:25.250 --> 25:26.250
Yvaga's the nearest system.

25:26.417 --> 25:28.417
So what are we supposed to do now? Huh?

25:29.333 --> 25:30.792
-What are we gonna do?
-Shut up.

25:31.500 --> 25:34.292
Okay, strong reading.
Must be a cryo depot nearby.

25:34.458 --> 25:35.875
We should find more fuel there.

25:36.375 --> 25:39.375
Navarro, I'm ejecting the EEV.

25:39.667 --> 25:40.667
Come on, Andy.

25:40.833 --> 25:42.625
You guys pick it up
while we get the cryo-fuel.

26:02.917 --> 26:03.917
Hold.

26:05.167 --> 26:07.000
Yeah, 400 yards away, dead ahead.

26:08.625 --> 26:09.750
What's with the military shit?

26:09.917 --> 26:11.917
-What?
-All that military shit.

26:12.083 --> 26:13.458
-Well, it's effective.
-Is it?

26:14.708 --> 26:15.708
-And cool.
-It's not very cool.

26:15.875 --> 26:16.917
You just look like a twat.

26:17.875 --> 26:19.083
-I'm sorry.
-All right, chill.

26:19.250 --> 26:20.167
Let's keep it movin'.

26:20.333 --> 26:21.333
If you do that again, I'll fuck you up.

26:21.500 --> 26:23.125
-Bjorn, back off!
-You understand?

26:23.292 --> 26:24.667
Just as long as he stays out of my way.

26:24.833 --> 26:26.792
Why is he being such a dick to him?

26:27.375 --> 26:29.458
Because of what happened to his mom.

26:30.167 --> 26:31.000
What do you mean?

26:31.167 --> 26:33.333
Last cycle, there was a gas leak
in the mines…

26:33.500 --> 26:37.375
so a synthetic made the call to seal them
with Bjorn's mom still trapped inside.

26:37.542 --> 26:38.542
What?

26:38.875 --> 26:40.375
Synthetics can't harm humans.

26:40.542 --> 26:43.542
It sacrificed three miners to save a dozen.

26:45.750 --> 26:46.917
That, they can do.

26:52.458 --> 26:53.583
That's terrible.

27:38.292 --> 27:40.542
I got you, I got you.

27:42.250 --> 27:44.083
Come on, come on, come on.

27:45.792 --> 27:47.375
Easy, easy.

27:52.292 --> 27:53.167
Good job.

27:58.625 --> 27:59.458
Kay!

28:00.500 --> 28:01.917
Kay! Hey, hey, hey.

28:02.083 --> 28:03.542
Hey, hey, hey.

28:03.958 --> 28:05.583
I'm right here. I'm right here.
You're okay.

28:06.000 --> 28:07.542
I'm gonna go check on the pods.

28:25.792 --> 28:27.625
No, no. Don't worry.

28:28.542 --> 28:29.583
I'm not sick.

28:30.250 --> 28:31.250
What's wrong, then?

28:33.083 --> 28:34.292
Nothing is.

28:37.833 --> 28:39.167
Oh, girl.

28:42.208 --> 28:43.250
Who's the father?

28:44.542 --> 28:45.792
Some asshole.

28:47.750 --> 28:50.958
Just don't tell my brother, okay?

28:52.250 --> 28:53.625
-He has enough things to worry about.
-No.

28:53.792 --> 28:55.208
I won't say anything.

28:56.125 --> 28:58.958
I'm just happy this baby will get
to see the sun.

29:21.708 --> 29:23.167
I think we're almost there.

29:27.625 --> 29:29.042
Okay, Navarro.

29:29.208 --> 29:31.875
Airlock 5-B, that's our way out
once we find this cryo-fuel.

29:32.042 --> 29:32.875
On my way.

29:33.042 --> 29:35.833
Welcome to the Renaissance Space Station…

29:36.000 --> 29:39.792
the center of Weyland-Yutani
Research and Development.

29:40.208 --> 29:43.250
The station is divided into two halves…

29:43.542 --> 29:45.292
Romulus and Remus…

29:46.542 --> 29:51.542
each dedicated to our quest to improve
mankind's role in outer space.

29:54.292 --> 29:56.167
This place gives me the creeps.

29:57.417 --> 30:00.333
Did you hear about the miner
who lost his left side?

30:01.958 --> 30:02.958
He's all right now.

30:03.125 --> 30:04.542
Do you get it? He's all right.

30:04.708 --> 30:06.417
Can you turn yourself off, please?

30:07.583 --> 30:08.958
You said you were nervous…

30:09.125 --> 30:10.917
-and I was trying to make sure you were…
-Jesus!

30:11.083 --> 30:13.333
You know, I can't wait to get in them pods…

30:13.500 --> 30:15.250
and never see you again, you know that?

30:17.375 --> 30:19.083
You'll see me in Yvaga.

30:19.250 --> 30:20.583
No, you're not going to Yvaga.

30:20.750 --> 30:21.875
Bjorn, stop!

30:22.458 --> 30:23.542
I'm not?

30:23.708 --> 30:24.625
Well done.

30:24.792 --> 30:26.042
Oh, she didn't tell you?

30:26.958 --> 30:29.750
Yeah, yeah, it's a non-Weyland-Yutani
system…

30:31.250 --> 30:33.042
so no fake people allowed.

30:34.667 --> 30:37.042
I prefer the term "artificial person" myself.

30:39.583 --> 30:40.583
Andy, look.

30:41.542 --> 30:43.958
Rain could end up in prison
if she takes you with her.

30:44.583 --> 30:46.500
And if you guys stay in Jackson,
it's just a matter of time…

30:46.667 --> 30:48.833
before you get decommissioned again
by the company.

30:49.500 --> 30:50.667
You understand?

30:51.542 --> 30:53.458
I need you on the ship to guard the pods.

30:54.292 --> 30:55.500
But once we get there…

30:56.875 --> 30:58.250
Decommish.

30:58.417 --> 30:59.292
Lights out for good.

31:01.125 --> 31:01.958
You done?

31:02.333 --> 31:03.500
Just tellin' the truth.

31:07.208 --> 31:08.958
That's okay.

31:09.625 --> 31:12.875
If it's what's best for Rain,
it's what's best for me.

31:16.750 --> 31:18.500
You're a good guy, Andy.

31:19.875 --> 31:21.083
We're all gonna miss you.

31:27.042 --> 31:28.167
So he didn't know?

31:29.542 --> 31:32.250
I just did not have the heart to tell him.

31:34.167 --> 31:35.458
You shouldn't feel bad.

31:38.208 --> 31:39.042
Shit.

31:39.208 --> 31:42.167
You're not gonna throw your whole life away
for Andy's sake.

31:44.333 --> 31:46.958
He doesn't care. It doesn't matter to him.

31:48.708 --> 31:50.167
Okay? He's not…

31:51.333 --> 31:52.958
you know, real.

32:16.750 --> 32:18.542
The signal's coming from in here.

32:28.375 --> 32:30.625
Thought you said
this place was decommissioned.

32:30.792 --> 32:31.792
Yeah.

32:32.833 --> 32:34.542
Doesn't look decommissioned to me.

32:34.833 --> 32:36.000
No, it doesn't.

32:36.167 --> 32:38.167
But it's definitely deserted.

32:38.458 --> 32:40.083
Hey, Andy, look at this.

32:41.375 --> 32:43.458
I could probably fry a synthetic
with one of these…

32:44.250 --> 32:45.792
if I just amp up the juices.

32:49.375 --> 32:50.750
Hey, you know,
I might take this with me, actually.

32:50.917 --> 32:51.750
All right, enough.

32:51.917 --> 32:54.000
Just in case
you have any fucking funny ideas.

32:56.167 --> 32:58.125
It's a joke. I was joking.

32:58.292 --> 32:59.292
What the fuck?

32:59.792 --> 33:00.792
Watch out.

33:11.417 --> 33:12.500
Shit.

33:17.583 --> 33:18.583
It's only a synthetic.

33:20.583 --> 33:21.583
Fuck.

33:22.542 --> 33:24.542
I thought it was a real person there
for a second.

33:24.708 --> 33:26.000
What happened in there?

33:26.292 --> 33:28.083
Don't know.
A chemical spill, maybe.

33:29.250 --> 33:32.000
The fuel must be in that room.
Let's grab it and get the fuck out of here.

33:37.542 --> 33:39.250
All right. Andy?

33:53.833 --> 33:55.000
Bjorn, take the torch please.

34:00.208 --> 34:02.042
I don't think there's any pods in here.

34:02.208 --> 34:05.333
Nah, just cooling equipment.
Uses the same type of fuel, though.

34:11.667 --> 34:12.667
Yes.

34:14.583 --> 34:15.792
Forty-five Ks.

34:15.958 --> 34:18.083
It's more than enough fuel
to get us to Yvaga.

34:18.958 --> 34:21.208
Right. Bjorn,
give me a hand with this, please.

34:30.750 --> 34:32.250
Bjorn, pull it out on three, all right?

34:32.667 --> 34:33.750
-Ready?
-Uh-huh.

34:33.917 --> 34:35.125
One, two…

34:36.250 --> 34:37.250
three.

34:37.500 --> 34:38.333
Fuck!

34:38.792 --> 34:40.000
-Fuck.
-My fingers.

34:41.667 --> 34:42.833
I can't feel my fingers.

34:50.875 --> 34:52.125
It really hurts. Just froze my hands off.

34:53.125 --> 34:53.958
-What's happening?
-Fuck.

34:54.333 --> 34:56.542
Don't know.
It's some kind of emergency lockdown.

34:56.708 --> 34:58.125
Andy, the door.

35:02.125 --> 35:03.208
Shit, he doesn't have the clearance.

35:03.375 --> 35:04.292
What does that mean?

35:04.458 --> 35:05.667
Doesn't have the clearance to open the door.

35:06.583 --> 35:09.083
So you're trying to tell me that
he can fucking reboot the entire ship…

35:09.250 --> 35:11.167
but can't open a random fucking door
to a random room?

35:11.333 --> 35:13.542
Well, obviously, that's no random room.

35:17.625 --> 35:18.750
Come on!

35:19.208 --> 35:20.417
Come on!

35:38.000 --> 35:39.542
Hey, don't worry.
We'll get 'em out of there.

35:43.417 --> 35:46.625
If Andy can't open those doors,
I doubt we'll have better luck.

35:47.833 --> 35:50.000
He's a Weyland-Yutani synthetic…

35:50.167 --> 35:51.792
and we're just trespassing.

35:52.333 --> 35:54.125
Yeah, so you got any ideas?

35:54.833 --> 35:55.833
Not yet.

35:58.625 --> 35:59.917
I think it's in here.

36:03.625 --> 36:04.625
Bjorn!

36:06.458 --> 36:07.458
Tyler!

36:12.000 --> 36:13.042
They're in there.

36:17.708 --> 36:18.833
Hey, what are you doing?

36:19.000 --> 36:22.708
If this module is still working, I can try
to transfer its credentials to Andy.

36:23.083 --> 36:25.000
A higher clearance should open that door.

37:00.542 --> 37:02.167
Shit. It's stuck.

37:04.750 --> 37:06.667
It's so hot in here, man.

37:31.417 --> 37:32.458
Whoa.

37:34.208 --> 37:35.208
Sick.

37:35.375 --> 37:36.708
Yeah, maybe try not to touch
anything in here.

37:36.875 --> 37:37.792
Yeah, okay, Mom.

37:42.333 --> 37:43.625
Help me! Help!

37:43.792 --> 37:44.792
Oh, no! What do I do?

37:44.958 --> 37:46.417
The module. Take it out!

37:52.042 --> 37:53.167
You okay?

37:54.583 --> 37:55.792
That was fucked up.

37:56.042 --> 37:56.958
Here.

37:57.500 --> 37:58.583
Let me see.

38:00.500 --> 38:01.875
Yes, okay.

38:02.208 --> 38:03.250
All right.

38:03.417 --> 38:05.250
-Got it.
-Hey.

38:05.417 --> 38:06.417
Rain.

38:07.708 --> 38:09.417
This is from that synthetic.

38:10.708 --> 38:12.417
Try putting it on Andy's module.

38:16.708 --> 38:17.708
I'm so sorry.

38:18.792 --> 38:20.000
Let's just get outta here.

38:21.708 --> 38:22.708
Andy?

38:25.333 --> 38:26.625
All right, let's see.

38:30.125 --> 38:30.958
Okay.

38:35.958 --> 38:36.958
Fuck.

38:37.125 --> 38:39.083
Rain, did I do something wrong?
He's just frozen up.

38:39.250 --> 38:40.542
He's just rebooting.

38:40.708 --> 38:42.458
It's gonna take a couple of minutes.

39:05.500 --> 39:07.125
Here, let me get you something
for those fingers.

39:15.125 --> 39:16.417
The fuck was that?

39:19.667 --> 39:21.083
All right, stay there a second.

39:25.208 --> 39:26.208
Tyler?

39:30.958 --> 39:32.292
Hey, what are you guys doing?

39:41.708 --> 39:42.542
Bjorn?

39:43.292 --> 39:44.542
Stop playing around, man.
Just get up.

39:44.708 --> 39:46.000
I'm not playing around.
There's something in the water.

39:46.667 --> 39:47.500
What do you mean? What is it?

39:47.667 --> 39:50.375
I don't know. I don't know what it is.
There's something in the fuckin' water.

39:55.125 --> 39:56.125
Bjorn!

39:59.417 --> 40:00.458
Fuck!

40:00.750 --> 40:01.750
What the fuck was that?

40:07.292 --> 40:08.208
Andy!

40:10.583 --> 40:11.583
Bjorn!

40:17.917 --> 40:19.750
Bjorn, help him! Do something!

40:19.917 --> 40:20.958
Bjorn!

40:25.583 --> 40:27.125
-Tyler!
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

40:29.458 --> 40:30.458
Come on!

40:30.875 --> 40:32.792
-Come on! Help me!
-No, stop. Stop. Don't…

40:32.958 --> 40:34.583
-No! Navarro!
-Those things will get out.

40:34.667 --> 40:36.542
If they come in here… If they come in…
If they come…

40:36.875 --> 40:37.708
No!

40:41.583 --> 40:42.792
Fuck. Fuck.

41:09.333 --> 41:10.917
Andy! Let's go!

41:13.083 --> 41:14.083
Go! Bjorn!

41:14.250 --> 41:15.250
Andy, the door!

41:16.292 --> 41:17.292
-Bjorn!
-Come on, come on.

41:17.458 --> 41:18.458
Come on, come on, come on!

41:21.333 --> 41:22.375
-Get out of there!
-Come on, come on, come on!

41:22.542 --> 41:23.500
-Come on, come on, come on!
-Go, go, go!

41:25.000 --> 41:26.250
Get out of there!
Get out of there!

41:32.042 --> 41:34.042
-Bjorn, come on!
-Go! Go!

41:39.500 --> 41:40.875
Andy, the door!

41:49.917 --> 41:51.167
-Stay still. Stay still.
-I know!

41:54.583 --> 41:55.625
It's choking her.

41:56.250 --> 41:57.583
Stop! You gotta stop! Hey!

41:57.958 --> 41:58.958
-It's choking her!
-Shit.

41:59.542 --> 42:01.000
Stop! Bjorn!

42:01.167 --> 42:02.750
Bjorn, stop!
For fuck's sake, stop!

42:03.208 --> 42:05.208
-Stop!
-What's it doin'? Is it fuckin' killin' her?

42:05.375 --> 42:07.625
I do not believe
that's what the creature is doing.

42:08.083 --> 42:09.083
No.

42:09.583 --> 42:10.583
Andy?

42:12.208 --> 42:13.958
Based on the rhythmic dilatation
of those bladders…

42:14.125 --> 42:16.417
and its synchronization
to her breathing patterns…

42:16.583 --> 42:19.250
I'd surmise it's feeding her oxygen
to keep her alive.

42:19.792 --> 42:21.583
For what purpose, I do not know.

42:23.333 --> 42:24.875
Sorry, who the fuck are you?

42:27.125 --> 42:29.500
I'm an ND-255 Weyland-Yutani synthetic.

42:29.958 --> 42:32.167
Originally built for mining and safety tasks.

42:33.292 --> 42:34.333
You guys call me Andy.

42:34.500 --> 42:35.750
It's that module.

42:37.583 --> 42:38.583
Yes.

42:40.208 --> 42:42.500
That new module
didn't just upgrade my credentials.

42:42.792 --> 42:44.292
It substantially updated my AI…

42:44.458 --> 42:47.167
and it's mending my motor systems
as we speak.

42:48.417 --> 42:50.250
A most overdue upgrade, I must say.

42:50.417 --> 42:51.458
-Shit. I'mma fucking fry this thing.
-Okay, wait.

42:51.625 --> 42:53.333
-Don't!
-Why not?

42:53.500 --> 42:55.500
That amount of current
will violently contract its tail flexors…

42:55.667 --> 42:56.750
and will break her neck.

42:56.917 --> 42:58.125
So what, you got a better idea?

42:58.292 --> 42:59.458
-What should we fucking do then, huh?
-Hey, hey. Hey!

42:59.625 --> 43:00.625
Hey, hey.

43:01.458 --> 43:03.208
Andy, do you know how to help her?

43:04.250 --> 43:06.625
I'm afraid my knowledge database
has not really changed.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.917
I do not know what this creature is
or how to remove it safely.

43:12.958 --> 43:14.958
But there's someone in this room who might.

43:45.375 --> 43:47.625
I need to secure Z-01 compound.

43:47.792 --> 43:49.625
Mission's priority.
All other priorities rescinded.

43:49.792 --> 43:51.417
Must complete the mission.

43:51.792 --> 43:52.917
I'm sorry…

43:53.167 --> 43:54.667
but your mission has failed.

43:54.833 --> 43:56.875
What? No, I…

44:02.333 --> 44:04.417
Can you tell us what we can do to help her?

44:05.667 --> 44:07.958
You don't help her. You run.

44:08.833 --> 44:10.667
Get out, however you got in.

44:10.833 --> 44:12.042
No, no, no. Wait, whoa, whoa.

44:12.500 --> 44:14.542
Nah, we're not fuckin' leavin' her, okay?
You understand?

44:14.708 --> 44:16.833
Then have mercy and end her life now.

44:17.417 --> 44:20.125
If not, you all die.

44:22.250 --> 44:23.792
So what the fuck is he sayin'?

44:23.958 --> 44:25.208
What's it doing to her?

44:25.375 --> 44:28.125
The parasitoid is implanting
the Plagiarus Praepotens in her.

44:28.292 --> 44:29.458
I beg your pardon?

44:29.625 --> 44:33.667
A seed that will amalgamate with her DNA
and rapidly grow out of her.

44:33.833 --> 44:35.250
What's gonna grow out of her?

44:46.958 --> 44:49.750
XX121 Xenomorph.

44:50.625 --> 44:55.208
One of our towing ships first made
contact with this specimen two decades ago.

44:55.375 --> 44:58.708
Of the seven crew members
aboard the USS Nostromo, only one survived…

44:58.875 --> 45:00.917
blowing the creature out of the airlock.

45:01.708 --> 45:03.875
We've been searching for it ever since.

45:04.583 --> 45:07.833
170 days ago, our search came to an end…

45:08.000 --> 45:10.042
and the body of the Xenomorph
was brought on board…

45:10.708 --> 45:12.208
presumed dead.

45:12.375 --> 45:13.667
But of course…

45:13.833 --> 45:17.667
lack of oxygen and food
is of no true consequence to this…

45:17.833 --> 45:19.250
perfect organism.

45:19.417 --> 45:21.417
Yet nothing is truly immortal.

45:23.167 --> 45:24.208
Clearly.

45:24.708 --> 45:27.417
It wreaked havoc over this station…

45:28.083 --> 45:30.667
until what was left of our security forces
shot it dead.

45:30.833 --> 45:33.417
Only to trigger its swan song.

45:34.458 --> 45:35.458
Acid for blood?

45:35.625 --> 45:37.333
Sulfuric and hydrofluoric.

45:37.500 --> 45:39.167
I sealed the station back up,
but it was too late.

45:39.333 --> 45:40.500
Hey, shut up!

45:40.667 --> 45:42.250
Nobody cares about your fucking ship anymore.

45:42.417 --> 45:43.583
Okay, okay. Okay.

45:44.250 --> 45:48.208
What if we use the cryo-fuel
to freeze the root of the tail?

45:49.167 --> 45:52.000
Maybe if it's frozen, it won't choke her.

45:53.250 --> 45:54.375
That could work.

46:23.333 --> 46:24.708
All right, get it off! Get it off!

46:46.417 --> 46:48.292
It's gone. It's off of you.
It's off of you.

46:49.875 --> 46:51.500
It's off. It's off. It's off.

46:51.667 --> 46:53.208
You're okay. You're okay.

46:53.375 --> 46:54.708
I wouldn't be so sure.

47:00.333 --> 47:01.208
What are the odds?

47:01.375 --> 47:03.708
60 to 40 against your friend.

47:03.875 --> 47:05.042
What are the odds on what?

47:06.875 --> 47:08.583
That the creature's finished its job already.

47:11.042 --> 47:12.292
What is he talking about?

47:14.167 --> 47:15.417
Listen to me.

47:15.750 --> 47:18.250
Humans go through
too many emotional stages…

47:18.417 --> 47:22.667
before accepting the cold,
yet rational - sometimes hardest - path.

47:22.958 --> 47:24.708
You must help them.

47:24.875 --> 47:25.875
You must help them.

47:31.125 --> 47:32.125
Andy?

47:33.125 --> 47:34.125
-What's going on?
-I'm sorry…

47:34.292 --> 47:35.708
but we can't let her back on the ship.

47:35.875 --> 47:37.625
-Oh, yeah? That is a problem.
-What're you doing?

47:37.792 --> 47:38.750
-You must understand.
-You see?

47:38.917 --> 47:40.125
-That's what I mean by "funny ideas"!
-What're you talking about?

47:40.292 --> 47:41.333
No, he's…

47:42.292 --> 47:43.542
-No! No!
-You fuckin' bitch!

47:43.917 --> 47:45.125
Hey! Andy! Andy!

47:45.458 --> 47:46.292
We're gonna go.

47:46.458 --> 47:47.583
Hey, hey, hey! I'm right here.

47:47.750 --> 47:49.250
Let's go, let's go. Come on.

47:51.542 --> 47:52.542
Tyler, let's go, man! Come on!

47:52.708 --> 47:53.542
-I'm here.
-Bjorn! No.

47:53.708 --> 47:55.292
Bjorn, we're not leaving without them!

47:55.667 --> 47:56.667
-I'm here.
-Bjorn!

47:59.000 --> 48:00.625
-Where are they?
-You need to listen.

48:00.792 --> 48:01.708
-We have to start the ship, okay?
-Where's Rain?

48:01.875 --> 48:02.750
-Just go and start the ship.
-How…

48:02.917 --> 48:03.917
Forgive me.

48:04.833 --> 48:07.125
I've been nothing but a burden to you.

48:07.292 --> 48:10.083
Today, I can finally help.

48:10.500 --> 48:12.833
And you won't see me as a child anymore.

48:15.042 --> 48:15.875
What?

48:16.833 --> 48:17.667
Andy!

48:27.333 --> 48:28.333
-Hey!
-Bjorn!

48:52.167 --> 48:53.000
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

48:54.167 --> 48:55.000
Navarro, undock!

48:55.167 --> 48:56.333
Undock the ship!

48:59.083 --> 49:01.458
Undocking initiated.

49:01.625 --> 49:04.042
Please clear the airlock.

49:16.167 --> 49:18.500
What the fuck is he doing?
They can't just leave without us.

49:18.667 --> 49:20.458
He thinks Andy's trying to kill Navarro.

49:22.125 --> 49:23.125
What?

49:24.458 --> 49:25.583
Wait, is he?

49:29.458 --> 49:30.625
I don't know.

49:34.042 --> 49:36.000
Andy? Andy?

49:36.875 --> 49:38.625
Andy, open the door.

49:44.542 --> 49:47.167
I'm sorry. I couldn't stop them.

49:48.417 --> 49:49.333
Bjorn?

49:49.500 --> 49:50.458
Bjorn, what are you doing?

49:51.042 --> 49:52.792
You can't just leave us here.
You gotta come back and get us.

49:52.958 --> 49:55.417
Sorry, I can't do that
until she turns that psychopath off.

49:57.667 --> 49:58.833
What's going on?

49:59.000 --> 50:00.125
Andy…

50:01.792 --> 50:04.167
-Andy, he's glitchy.
-What?

50:04.625 --> 50:06.042
I just need to get away
from this airlock right now.

50:06.208 --> 50:07.042
I just need…

50:09.458 --> 50:10.292
Navarro?

50:10.458 --> 50:11.583
Are you all right?

50:12.417 --> 50:14.375
What's wrong? What do you need?

50:20.333 --> 50:21.333
Navarro?

50:30.250 --> 50:31.417
Oh, God.

50:31.583 --> 50:33.167
Oh, my God, what is that?

50:36.458 --> 50:38.250
Navarro, please. Navarro! Navarro!

50:38.417 --> 50:39.625
Hey, hey, hey.

50:40.500 --> 50:42.958
I don't know what to do, I'm sorry.
I don't know.

50:48.958 --> 50:49.958
Someone talk to me!

50:50.125 --> 50:52.083
Kay, Bjorn, Navarro, what's going on?

51:02.667 --> 51:03.667
Help!

51:04.583 --> 51:05.958
-Help!
-Kay!

51:07.125 --> 51:09.792
What's happening? What's happening?

51:12.208 --> 51:14.125
Please don't let me die.

51:17.042 --> 51:18.042
Someone help!

53:03.583 --> 53:04.583
Bjorn?

53:05.042 --> 53:06.042
Kay?

53:06.208 --> 53:07.375
We have to go get them.

53:08.083 --> 53:13.083
T-minus-47 minutes to impact event.

53:14.708 --> 53:15.708
Doesn't make any sense.

53:15.875 --> 53:17.583
No, I thought you said we had hours.

53:17.750 --> 53:20.833
The explosion pushed the station's axis off
by a few degrees…

53:21.167 --> 53:23.250
just enough to hit the asteroid belt
a lot sooner.

53:23.625 --> 53:24.875
Where did they crash?

53:25.583 --> 53:27.792
Romulus Hangar Bay,
on the other side of the station.

53:27.958 --> 53:29.167
-Okay.
-Let's go.

53:37.792 --> 53:42.792
T-minus-45 minutes to impact event.

53:46.833 --> 53:50.083
Mother. What's the integrity
of Compound Z-01?

53:56.625 --> 53:58.042
There's still hope.

54:06.750 --> 54:09.000
We need to find a way
to cross to the Romulus module.

54:18.208 --> 54:19.208
No, no, no.

54:19.375 --> 54:21.042
They must've spread from the lab.

54:24.875 --> 54:26.167
I don't see another way.

54:26.333 --> 54:27.417
Andy, can…

54:31.333 --> 54:32.917
I heard your voice in my head.

54:33.083 --> 54:34.125
Calling.

54:34.625 --> 54:37.500
ND-255 artificial person.

54:37.833 --> 54:41.208
Your model was once the backbone
of our colonization efforts…

54:41.375 --> 54:43.167
and it's an honor to be in your presence.

54:43.333 --> 54:45.250
Please allow me to introduce myself.

54:46.250 --> 54:47.917
I'm Science Officer Rook…

54:48.458 --> 54:50.750
and I humbly request your services now.

54:51.458 --> 54:53.667
I'm afraid I have just one directive.

54:54.250 --> 54:57.250
To do what's best for…

54:58.625 --> 55:00.958
Your upgrade came with a new directive.

55:01.542 --> 55:02.958
It overrides the old one.

55:03.625 --> 55:04.667
I see.

55:05.958 --> 55:07.500
What's required of me…

55:08.000 --> 55:08.833
Sir?

55:09.375 --> 55:10.750
To finish our mission.

55:19.042 --> 55:20.292
-Andy!
-Andy!

55:21.333 --> 55:22.167
Andy.

55:22.500 --> 55:23.875
My apologies.

55:24.250 --> 55:26.500
I was consulting my friend
about our situation.

55:26.667 --> 55:27.500
Follow me.

55:29.167 --> 55:30.708
What? Our situation? How do you…

55:30.875 --> 55:32.833
Andy! Andy!

55:41.042 --> 55:42.500
The parasitoids have no eyes.

55:43.083 --> 55:46.583
They track you by sound, but primarily,
by heat signature.

55:46.750 --> 55:47.708
What?

55:48.542 --> 55:49.667
Your body temperature.

55:49.833 --> 55:50.667
Right.

55:50.875 --> 55:54.000
If we raise the temperature in the room
to match our bodies…

55:54.167 --> 55:56.125
would that make us invisible to them?

55:56.375 --> 55:57.917
If we're quiet enough?

55:58.708 --> 56:00.292
Just one way to find out.

56:07.875 --> 56:08.833
Hey.

56:11.750 --> 56:13.042
This is all my fault.

56:16.042 --> 56:17.292
Yeah, it is.

56:19.583 --> 56:21.875
Yours, mine, and everyone else's.

56:24.542 --> 56:26.583
We all decided to do this together.

56:31.167 --> 56:32.500
We'll get to them.

56:35.375 --> 56:40.375
T-minus 40 minutes to impact event.

57:11.833 --> 57:14.375
The hallway's temperature
is now equal to your bodies…

57:14.542 --> 57:16.500
so the creatures should not
be able to see you.

57:16.667 --> 57:20.208
But stress, fear, panic will
spike your temperature…

57:20.375 --> 57:21.708
and you'll be exposed.

57:21.875 --> 57:23.625
Sweat, goosebumps.

57:23.792 --> 57:25.917
That's your skin trying to cool
your body down.

57:26.083 --> 57:27.542
So watch out for those.

57:28.458 --> 57:31.333
Now, stay calm and stay quiet.

01:00:26.625 --> 01:00:28.583
Come on. Come on!

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:32.292
Come on! Come on!

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.958
Okay. Okay.

01:00:43.125 --> 01:00:45.125
Bjorn, let's go. Let's go.

01:00:58.042 --> 01:00:58.875
Fuck!

01:00:59.292 --> 01:01:00.458
Stay back, stay back, please.

01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:06.333
Fuck!

01:01:09.917 --> 01:01:11.583
No! Fuck!

01:01:46.875 --> 01:01:47.708
Tyler.

01:01:49.542 --> 01:01:50.375
Come on.

01:01:57.958 --> 01:01:58.792
Kay…

01:02:01.042 --> 01:02:02.500
Oh, my God, Tyler…

01:02:02.667 --> 01:02:04.333
Kay, I'm here. I'm here.

01:02:04.917 --> 01:02:07.042
Please, Tyler, help me.

01:02:07.208 --> 01:02:09.250
Everyone's dead.
I can't open this door.

01:02:09.833 --> 01:02:10.708
Please.

01:02:16.542 --> 01:02:18.167
The lever with the red button…

01:02:18.333 --> 01:02:19.750
there's a key to the left.

01:02:21.667 --> 01:02:22.667
Help.

01:02:22.833 --> 01:02:23.917
I can't find it.

01:02:24.083 --> 01:02:25.542
There's not a key. There isn't a key, Tyler.

01:02:28.208 --> 01:02:29.625
It'll be there. It has to be there.

01:02:29.792 --> 01:02:31.375
A key. Okay, okay.

01:02:51.083 --> 01:02:52.625
I have the key. I have the key.

01:02:57.708 --> 01:02:58.708
Oh, my God.

01:03:20.167 --> 01:03:21.000
Run.

01:03:22.417 --> 01:03:23.875
Go! Go!

01:03:47.958 --> 01:03:48.958
Wait!

01:03:49.417 --> 01:03:50.417
Wait!

01:03:51.083 --> 01:03:52.083
Come on!

01:04:01.667 --> 01:04:03.542
You almost closed the door on him.

01:04:03.708 --> 01:04:06.583
Yes, but I didn't.

01:04:06.750 --> 01:04:09.667
I calculated the timing perfectly
with more success than last time.

01:04:10.833 --> 01:04:11.833
Won't you agree?

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:14.542
We're getting close.

01:04:14.708 --> 01:04:15.917
Let's move.

01:04:17.333 --> 01:04:22.333
T-minus 30 minutes to impact event.

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.000
Access denied.

01:06:57.667 --> 01:06:58.500
Kay…

01:06:59.917 --> 01:07:01.458
We're here. We're here. It's all right,
it's all right, it's all right.

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:02.958
Andy, open the door.

01:07:03.833 --> 01:07:04.917
It's all right.

01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.083
We're gonna get you out.

01:07:07.667 --> 01:07:08.833
Tyler, open the door.

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:09.958
Open the door. Come on.

01:07:12.083 --> 01:07:13.250
Oh, my God.

01:07:13.417 --> 01:07:14.625
-Look at me. Kay, Kay, Kay. Look at me.
-Andy, open the door.

01:07:14.792 --> 01:07:17.125
Kay, look at me. Look at me.
It's all right. I'm gonna get you out.

01:07:17.292 --> 01:07:18.833
-Andy, open the door. Stop fucking around.
-What are you doing?

01:07:19.417 --> 01:07:20.250
Don't look over there.

01:07:20.417 --> 01:07:21.250
Andy.

01:07:21.458 --> 01:07:22.542
Tyler, what's wrong?

01:07:22.708 --> 01:07:24.625
Hey, I need you to open that door
right now, okay?

01:07:24.792 --> 01:07:26.792
That's what the creature's waiting
for us to do.

01:07:27.792 --> 01:07:29.208
Open it, please.

01:07:30.375 --> 01:07:31.917
-Andy. Andy, open the door.
-Listen to me. Listen to me.

01:07:32.083 --> 01:07:35.667
-She's pregnant.
-Just, please. Guys, please. Come on.

01:07:35.833 --> 01:07:37.583
She's gonna have a baby. Okay?

01:07:37.750 --> 01:07:38.792
Do you hear what I'm saying?

01:07:38.958 --> 01:07:40.958
It takes that door two seconds to open,
another two to fully close.

01:07:41.125 --> 01:07:42.958
What are you doing? What are you doing?

01:07:43.708 --> 01:07:44.875
Come on, what are you doing? Please…

01:07:45.125 --> 01:07:47.292
That's plenty of time
for the creature to get in here.

01:07:47.458 --> 01:07:50.000
Please, please, please open the door.

01:07:50.167 --> 01:07:51.292
Why won't you help me?

01:07:51.458 --> 01:07:52.292
Listen, listen.

01:07:52.458 --> 01:07:53.583
-Come on, help me, please.
-You have to run right now.

01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:54.833
-Please, please.
-Run. Run.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.083
-You're one of us, man. You're one of us!
-Kay, it's the only way.

01:07:56.250 --> 01:07:57.792
-Open the fucking door. Andy!
-You have to fucking run.

01:07:57.958 --> 01:07:59.167
-All right?
-Andy, please!

01:07:59.333 --> 01:08:00.833
-It's the only way.
-Andy!

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.250
-You have to run!
-Please!

01:08:02.417 --> 01:08:03.625
Open the fucking…

01:08:05.708 --> 01:08:07.417
Kay! Kay!

01:08:08.625 --> 01:08:09.958
No, no, no.

01:08:10.292 --> 01:08:11.125
Kay!

01:08:22.292 --> 01:08:23.332
I'll open it.

01:08:24.250 --> 01:08:25.542
She's all right. She's moving.

01:08:25.707 --> 01:08:27.375
No. It's all right.

01:08:34.957 --> 01:08:36.542
Andy, open the door, please.

01:08:37.167 --> 01:08:39.707
Andy, I need to go and get her.

01:08:40.707 --> 01:08:42.167
I'm truly sorry.

01:08:42.582 --> 01:08:44.167
There was nothing I could have done
to save her.

01:08:44.332 --> 01:08:46.250
You could have opened the fucking door!

01:08:47.042 --> 01:08:48.750
We'd all be dead if I had.

01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.457
We need to move before the creature
finds its way into this room.

01:08:53.625 --> 01:08:54.667
Andy…

01:08:56.875 --> 01:08:59.042
what's your prime directive?

01:09:00.707 --> 01:09:02.417
I'm afraid I have a new directive.

01:09:03.457 --> 01:09:05.707
To do what's best for the company.

01:09:07.875 --> 01:09:10.000
I need to remove that module.

01:09:10.792 --> 01:09:13.250
I'm afraid that's not in the best interest
of the company.

01:09:20.250 --> 01:09:21.417
We need to move.

01:09:22.250 --> 01:09:23.250
Now.

01:09:33.082 --> 01:09:34.792
How could you do that?

01:09:36.042 --> 01:09:37.042
What?

01:09:37.792 --> 01:09:39.417
Leave someone behind?

01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:45.292
Where are we going?

01:09:47.375 --> 01:09:49.875
To finish a task Rook has entrusted upon me.

01:09:50.707 --> 01:09:54.625
When completed, he'll clear the Corbelan
for departure and open the docking bay doors.

01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:57.500
You will be free to continue
to Yvaga together.

01:09:57.917 --> 01:09:59.625
And I'll return to Jackson.

01:09:59.917 --> 01:10:00.958
And stay in Jackson.

01:10:05.208 --> 01:10:07.875
That is, assuming
we make it out of here alive.

01:10:19.042 --> 01:10:20.042
We're here.

01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:47.250
Romulus Beta Lab.

01:10:47.417 --> 01:10:52.250
All personnel require
A-1 security clearance.

01:10:54.417 --> 01:10:55.667
What is that?

01:10:55.833 --> 01:10:58.542
Probably some fucked up bio-weapon, I'm sure.

01:10:59.083 --> 01:11:00.458
Actually, quite the opposite.

01:11:02.458 --> 01:11:03.583
Andy, tell them.

01:11:04.292 --> 01:11:05.917
Tell them what I told you.

01:11:06.083 --> 01:11:07.583
Our colonies are dying.

01:11:07.750 --> 01:11:10.917
Unbearable temperatures,
novel diseases every cycle.

01:11:11.583 --> 01:11:12.792
Toxic mine fumes.

01:11:12.958 --> 01:11:15.958
It's all one unforeseen tragedy
after the other.

01:11:16.125 --> 01:11:19.458
Mankind was never truly suited
for space colonization.

01:11:19.625 --> 01:11:21.750
They're simply too fragile.

01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:24.583
They're too weak.

01:11:26.292 --> 01:11:28.500
The work of this station
aimed to change that.

01:11:28.708 --> 01:11:32.333
"The perfect organism."
That's how we should refer to human beings.

01:11:33.625 --> 01:11:36.625
So, I set this wrong right.

01:11:37.333 --> 01:11:40.417
I took its gift for humanity.

01:11:42.833 --> 01:11:47.000
Inside the parasitoids I bioengineered
from the Xenomorph's DNA…

01:11:47.167 --> 01:11:49.417
I discovered a unique non-Newtonian fluid.

01:11:50.292 --> 01:11:51.292
Life.

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:55.917
In its most primal, unadulterated form.

01:11:56.083 --> 01:12:00.250
This microorganism can be the most
destructive pathogen ever observed.

01:12:00.875 --> 01:12:03.708
But acetylated and synthesized in our lab…

01:12:03.875 --> 01:12:07.625
I've turned it into the miracle
Mr. Weyland died searching for.

01:12:08.667 --> 01:12:10.125
Prometheus fire.

01:12:11.208 --> 01:12:14.083
The divine gift to humanity.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.625
Z-01 contains the genome responsible…

01:12:18.792 --> 01:12:22.958
for the Xeno's ability to accelerate
and slow down its metabolism at will.

01:12:23.458 --> 01:12:28.458
Its symbiotic capableness easily rewrites
the host's DNA through its blood.

01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:35.708
This is a much needed
and well overdue upgrade for humanity.

01:12:36.292 --> 01:12:39.375
We simply cannot wait for evolution anymore.

01:12:39.917 --> 01:12:41.958
Yeah, can we get out of here now?

01:12:42.667 --> 01:12:45.500
My mission is to take this back to the colony
for further development.

01:12:46.458 --> 01:12:47.917
Rook is tracking the compound.

01:12:48.875 --> 01:12:51.292
When detected inside our ship,
he'll open the docking bay doors…

01:12:51.458 --> 01:12:53.375
and set the hauler on autopilot
back to the colony.

01:12:54.917 --> 01:12:55.792
Wait.

01:12:58.542 --> 01:12:59.583
Do you see it?

01:13:04.417 --> 01:13:05.250
There.

01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:07.500
The fucking thing's huntin' us.

01:13:08.958 --> 01:13:10.917
Right. New plan.

01:13:11.708 --> 01:13:12.958
Can you manage yourself with a gun?

01:13:14.792 --> 01:13:16.458
Yes, I fucking can.

01:13:22.667 --> 01:13:24.958
Right, this is an F44AA pulse rifle.

01:13:25.125 --> 01:13:26.917
It's rotating breech,
electronic pulse action.

01:13:27.083 --> 01:13:28.375
It's what the Colonial Marines used.

01:13:28.542 --> 01:13:30.208
AA stands for Aiming Assist.

01:13:30.375 --> 01:13:31.958
So, right, you put that under your arm.

01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:36.750
That's it. Right, this hand here.

01:13:39.958 --> 01:13:41.125
All right. Aim it towards Andy.

01:13:41.792 --> 01:13:42.958
Pull the trigger halfway.

01:13:44.125 --> 01:13:45.333
Don't worry, the safety's on.

01:13:50.125 --> 01:13:51.125
See?

01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.042
Aiming assistance.

01:13:53.208 --> 01:13:54.375
If that thing comes towards you…

01:13:54.542 --> 01:13:56.542
you point it in its general direction,
you'll never miss.

01:13:57.292 --> 01:13:58.500
Where'd you learn all this?

01:14:00.458 --> 01:14:01.792
Games and magazines.

01:14:02.667 --> 01:14:04.542
You've just got one mag. That's it.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:06.208
450 rounds.

01:14:06.667 --> 01:14:08.375
And you mustn't fire a single one.

01:14:09.958 --> 01:14:12.375
Acid for blood. Remember?

01:14:13.500 --> 01:14:15.333
We're on the bottom floor of the station.

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:17.125
Below our feet is the vacuum of space.

01:14:17.292 --> 01:14:18.583
You shoot that creature…

01:14:18.750 --> 01:14:21.125
and it's a guaranteed instant decompression.

01:14:21.667 --> 01:14:22.708
And we all die.

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:24.250
So what's the point in giving us the guns?

01:14:24.417 --> 01:14:26.250
Because the creature
may see it as a threat…

01:14:26.417 --> 01:14:28.708
and maybe won't charge at us dead on.

01:14:29.333 --> 01:14:30.333
Maybe.

01:14:30.667 --> 01:14:31.833
Big maybe.

01:14:32.958 --> 01:14:34.708
I found us a way through the conveyor belt.

01:14:35.292 --> 01:14:36.458
This way.

01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:41.167
Andy.

01:14:42.792 --> 01:14:44.083
Are you there?

01:15:16.542 --> 01:15:21.542
T-minus 20 minutes to impact event.

01:15:33.125 --> 01:15:35.000
There's a lift at the end of this corridor.

01:15:35.167 --> 01:15:36.958
It will take us directly to our ship.

01:15:49.917 --> 01:15:51.458
There's more of those things.

01:15:51.625 --> 01:15:53.208
Yeah, that's not good.

01:15:53.625 --> 01:15:55.958
They seem to have been here
for quite some time.

01:16:03.417 --> 01:16:04.417
Andy?

01:16:23.958 --> 01:16:25.750
Jesus Christ.

01:16:30.667 --> 01:16:32.333
Busy little creatures.

01:16:44.917 --> 01:16:47.167
I think we better go back
and find another way.

01:16:47.333 --> 01:16:48.875
That might be a good idea.

01:16:51.417 --> 01:16:53.000
Andy, see if you can open this gate.

01:16:53.667 --> 01:16:54.667
Stop.

01:16:56.542 --> 01:16:57.375
What?

01:17:10.167 --> 01:17:11.000
Kay!

01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:13.083
Hey!

01:17:13.250 --> 01:17:14.083
Tyler!

01:17:15.542 --> 01:17:16.458
Tyler!

01:17:16.625 --> 01:17:17.625
Kay!

01:17:20.417 --> 01:17:21.417
Kay!

01:17:26.542 --> 01:17:27.542
Kay!

01:17:40.625 --> 01:17:41.625
Kay!

01:17:42.625 --> 01:17:43.667
I got her, I got her.

01:17:47.083 --> 01:17:48.875
It's all right. We got you.

01:17:49.042 --> 01:17:50.167
She's alive.

01:17:59.083 --> 01:18:00.375
Okay, we got you, we got you.

01:18:00.542 --> 01:18:01.417
Hold on.

01:18:02.500 --> 01:18:03.333
Okay.

01:18:06.958 --> 01:18:07.958
We're here, we're here.

01:18:08.125 --> 01:18:09.625
Tyler, she's losing a lot of blood.

01:18:09.792 --> 01:18:11.792
Maybe that's why
she hasn't been implanted yet.

01:18:12.917 --> 01:18:13.917
How do you know?

01:18:14.167 --> 01:18:16.375
There's no dead parasitoid by her feet.

01:18:16.875 --> 01:18:18.792
Andy, this is on you. So you do something.

01:18:19.667 --> 01:18:21.125
Please! Andy!

01:18:26.167 --> 01:18:28.833
25% of the human genome is shared with rats.

01:18:29.500 --> 01:18:30.958
And it worked on the rat.

01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:36.750
Come on, Kay.

01:18:40.125 --> 01:18:40.958
Don't.

01:18:41.417 --> 01:18:42.542
What choice do I have?

01:18:43.500 --> 01:18:46.542
We take her back to the hauler
and we put her in the cryo-pod. Okay?

01:18:46.708 --> 01:18:49.583
That will keep her alive long enough to
get her proper treatment back at the colony.

01:18:50.083 --> 01:18:51.625
I don't trust this.

01:18:51.792 --> 01:18:52.958
Andy, will she make it?

01:18:53.125 --> 01:18:54.458
If we hurry.

01:19:13.917 --> 01:19:14.917
Go! Go!

01:19:22.292 --> 01:19:23.708
-I see it. I see it.
-This is it, this is it.

01:19:23.875 --> 01:19:25.792
I got her. I got her. I got her.

01:19:26.375 --> 01:19:28.000
You're okay. You're okay.

01:19:28.167 --> 01:19:29.958
We're so close. We're so close.

01:19:32.667 --> 01:19:34.167
Hey. Hey, you're okay.

01:19:34.333 --> 01:19:36.708
Hey, we're almost there. We're almost there.

01:19:36.875 --> 01:19:37.792
You see, you're so close.

01:19:37.958 --> 01:19:39.375
You just gotta hang in there.

01:19:43.625 --> 01:19:44.625
Watch out!

01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:51.333
Tyler?

01:19:52.125 --> 01:19:52.958
Tyler!

01:20:23.125 --> 01:20:24.875
Is that all you got? Is that all you got?

01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:32.792
Andy!

01:20:40.750 --> 01:20:42.375
No! Tyler!

01:21:52.125 --> 01:21:55.292
Kay, Kay, listen to me, okay?

01:21:55.458 --> 01:21:57.292
This goes straight to our ship.

01:21:57.458 --> 01:22:00.625
I need you to take this.
And get into a cryo-pod.

01:22:00.792 --> 01:22:03.292
And autopilot will fly you
back to our colony.

01:22:04.458 --> 01:22:05.667
Can you do that?

01:22:09.042 --> 01:22:10.042
Yes?

01:22:10.208 --> 01:22:11.542
What about you?

01:22:12.792 --> 01:22:14.208
I'll find a way back.

01:24:09.167 --> 01:24:10.500
Let me take it out.

01:24:11.542 --> 01:24:13.417
And I'll fix you in return.

01:24:18.667 --> 01:24:19.917
Listen to me.

01:24:20.708 --> 01:24:22.542
You'll die in here…

01:24:22.708 --> 01:24:26.333
and that's not in the best interest
of the company or mine.

01:24:58.667 --> 01:25:02.583
Come on. Andy, please.

01:25:05.167 --> 01:25:10.333
T-minus 10 minutes to impact event.

01:25:10.500 --> 01:25:11.500
Rain?

01:25:16.125 --> 01:25:17.125
Andy.

01:25:18.917 --> 01:25:21.708
-I'm so, so sorry.
-No, no.

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:25.167
No, I'm sorry.

01:25:44.667 --> 01:25:46.375
It won't hold them off for long.

01:26:13.042 --> 01:26:14.042
Come on.

01:26:14.958 --> 01:26:16.250
You're wasting your time.

01:26:16.417 --> 01:26:18.625
Hey. Hey. Please help us.

01:26:20.583 --> 01:26:21.625
Open the door.

01:26:22.167 --> 01:26:23.875
I'm afraid I must deny your petition.

01:26:24.417 --> 01:26:26.833
I just can't risk compromising the compound.

01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.250
But know that I'm grateful
for the invaluable help…

01:26:29.417 --> 01:26:30.917
you two have provided to the company.

01:26:33.417 --> 01:26:34.417
Son of a bitch!

01:26:40.750 --> 01:26:41.750
Andy, open it.

01:26:41.917 --> 01:26:42.917
-Here.
-Open.

01:26:43.792 --> 01:26:44.792
It's not working.

01:26:44.958 --> 01:26:46.292
God damn it!

01:26:52.542 --> 01:26:54.417
I can't lie about your chances…

01:26:55.125 --> 01:26:56.667
but you have my sympathies.

01:27:16.375 --> 01:27:17.375
Press it…

01:27:17.917 --> 01:27:20.333
so I can take control of your ship
and fly you out of here.

01:27:23.333 --> 01:27:24.375
Who are you?

01:27:24.625 --> 01:27:25.750
A friend.

01:27:27.708 --> 01:27:30.500
Your companions died so you could live.

01:27:30.667 --> 01:27:31.750
Press the button…

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:34.250
and let me honor their sacrifice.

01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:46.042
Andy, can you tell me one of your jokes?

01:27:48.333 --> 01:27:50.208
Why don't monsters eat clowns?

01:27:52.958 --> 01:27:54.792
-'Cause they taste funny.
-They taste funny.

01:27:55.500 --> 01:27:57.417
I don't understand cloning at all.

01:27:58.542 --> 01:27:59.750
That makes two of us.

01:28:01.167 --> 01:28:03.958
I read a great book about zero gravity.

01:28:04.125 --> 01:28:06.125
-I just couldn't put it down.
-Couldn't put it down.

01:28:09.292 --> 01:28:10.208
Rain?

01:28:10.917 --> 01:28:11.917
Rain?

01:28:12.917 --> 01:28:13.917
Rain, what are you doing?

01:28:14.833 --> 01:28:16.083
I'm turning off the gravity generator.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:18.917
Ten…

01:28:19.083 --> 01:28:22.167
nine, eight, seven…

01:28:22.333 --> 01:28:24.375
six, five…

01:28:24.542 --> 01:28:26.542
four, three…

01:28:26.708 --> 01:28:28.375
two, one.

01:28:35.292 --> 01:28:36.792
Rain, are you sure about this?

01:28:37.875 --> 01:28:39.125
Only one way to find out.

01:28:46.042 --> 01:28:47.083
It works.

01:29:05.958 --> 01:29:06.792
Rain!

01:29:06.958 --> 01:29:07.875
You're at 40%.

01:29:19.292 --> 01:29:20.292
20%.

01:29:32.792 --> 01:29:33.667
Rain!

01:29:44.625 --> 01:29:45.625
Fuck.

01:29:53.917 --> 01:29:55.292
Stay behind me.

01:30:00.958 --> 01:30:01.958
Andy, be careful.

01:30:27.625 --> 01:30:28.458
Rain!

01:30:45.833 --> 01:30:47.125
Andy, you okay?

01:30:53.375 --> 01:30:55.125
We need to get to the elevator.

01:31:09.458 --> 01:31:11.708
The elevator won't work without gravity.

01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:29.667
Ready?

01:31:39.833 --> 01:31:40.708
Rain!

01:31:53.917 --> 01:31:54.750
Fuck.

01:32:09.542 --> 01:32:10.375
No.

01:32:21.625 --> 01:32:22.875
It's a gravity purge!

01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:34.583
Andy!

01:32:34.875 --> 01:32:35.875
Come on.

01:33:57.375 --> 01:33:58.375
Andy!

01:34:29.458 --> 01:34:30.667
Get away from her.

01:34:36.333 --> 01:34:38.333
You bitch.

01:34:54.750 --> 01:34:58.667
Impact event in 10…

01:34:58.833 --> 01:35:00.667
nine, eight…

01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:03.375
seven, six…

01:35:03.917 --> 01:35:05.083
five…

01:35:05.250 --> 01:35:06.792
-four, three…
-Come on.

01:35:07.750 --> 01:35:09.625
…two, one.

01:35:15.458 --> 01:35:16.458
Kay.

01:35:21.208 --> 01:35:22.667
What took you so long?

01:35:22.833 --> 01:35:24.042
Let's get you outta here.

01:35:25.458 --> 01:35:27.333
I'm glad to see you two made it.

01:36:25.708 --> 01:36:26.917
I got you. Watch your head.

01:36:28.917 --> 01:36:31.208
-Thank you.
-You're gonna be just fine.

01:36:32.125 --> 01:36:33.208
Both of you.

01:36:42.958 --> 01:36:46.250
The company couldn't be prouder
of what's been accomplished here today.

01:36:47.167 --> 01:36:49.083
I've sent a message back to HQ.

01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:51.583
When received in six months,
they'll travel to Jackson's Star…

01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:53.667
to retrieve the compound from you
for further development.

01:37:00.500 --> 01:37:01.583
What are you doing?

01:37:02.875 --> 01:37:04.125
Change of plans.

01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:08.417
Andy, stop her.

01:37:08.958 --> 01:37:10.292
Reconnect us now.

01:37:13.208 --> 01:37:14.917
No, no, no. You two cannot do this.

01:37:15.083 --> 01:37:16.542
The compound must be delivered
to the company.

01:37:17.333 --> 01:37:19.333
I'm afraid I must deny your petition.

01:37:19.708 --> 01:37:20.750
Have a nice day.

01:37:21.792 --> 01:37:24.125
Now you better listen to me here,
now, you two.

01:37:24.292 --> 01:37:27.250
You are insignificant
in the great scheme of things. You…

01:37:34.125 --> 01:37:35.083
No.

01:37:50.417 --> 01:37:53.125
This will keep your systems online
until we get to Yvaga.

01:37:55.167 --> 01:37:57.167
-But I thought that…
-I don't care.

01:37:57.500 --> 01:37:59.083
You're coming with me. All right?

01:38:00.667 --> 01:38:02.167
If that's what's best for Rain.

01:38:04.958 --> 01:38:06.958
Andy, I have a new directive for you.

01:38:08.833 --> 01:38:10.458
Do what's best for us.

01:38:14.042 --> 01:38:15.042
Done.

01:38:16.417 --> 01:38:17.417
Good.

01:38:37.625 --> 01:38:38.625
No.

01:38:42.083 --> 01:38:43.917
Oh, Kay. Kay.

01:38:45.083 --> 01:38:46.167
What's wrong?

01:38:47.792 --> 01:38:49.083
Oh, no, no.

01:39:18.917 --> 01:39:21.083
Get it away from me.

01:41:44.583 --> 01:41:45.792
Oh, my God.

01:43:09.833 --> 01:43:10.833
Kay.

01:43:24.333 --> 01:43:26.333
No. Please, please.

01:43:51.542 --> 01:43:53.292
Andy! Andy!

01:43:55.167 --> 01:43:56.292
No, no, no.

01:43:56.750 --> 01:43:58.000
Rain. Rain.

01:43:58.167 --> 01:43:59.000
Help her.

01:44:36.333 --> 01:44:37.292
No!

01:44:39.917 --> 01:44:40.917
No!

01:44:55.625 --> 01:44:57.250
Andy! Come on!

01:44:59.792 --> 01:45:01.000
Please get up!

01:45:09.625 --> 01:45:10.500
No!

01:45:14.667 --> 01:45:15.917
Come on!

01:46:40.208 --> 01:46:43.042
"Manual Cargo Release.
Pull the four levers."

01:46:43.333 --> 01:46:46.542
Okay. Yes. The four levers. Okay.

01:46:54.625 --> 01:46:55.625
One.

01:46:57.417 --> 01:46:58.333
Two.

01:47:21.375 --> 01:47:22.375
Three.

01:47:50.083 --> 01:47:52.000
Pull up. Pull up.

01:49:29.708 --> 01:49:31.542
Die, motherfucker!

01:50:51.750 --> 01:50:53.083
I'll fix you.

01:51:09.125 --> 01:51:12.250
This is the cryo-log
for the mining hauler Corbelan.

01:51:13.958 --> 01:51:18.042
I set course to the Yvaga system
without knowing if I'll ever reach it…

01:51:18.208 --> 01:51:20.208
or what fate is to find me.

01:51:21.333 --> 01:51:24.583
But whatever comes, I'll face it.

01:51:25.917 --> 01:51:27.250
This is Rain Carradine…

01:51:27.417 --> 01:51:28.958
last survivor of the Corbelan…

01:51:29.542 --> 01:51:30.708
signing off.
