47:47.865 --> 47:50.032
- We did it.
- We did it.

47:50.033 --> 47:51.492
- You all right?
- I'm good. Thank you.

47:51.493 --> 47:54.830
They got him.
Coyote's coming home.

47:56.039 --> 47:58.457
Then just carry on as usual.

47:58.458 --> 48:01.962
You continue to inspire
respect and admiration

48:02.087 --> 48:04.006
from your superiors.

48:04.840 --> 48:06.007
Sir.

48:06.008 --> 48:07.550
- Well played, Martian.
- Thank you, sir.

48:07.551 --> 48:09.678
Yeah.
Well played.

48:18.854 --> 48:20.855
Move up the ranks,

48:20.856 --> 48:23.317
become very important.

48:24.902 --> 48:26.278
Doctor.

48:31.533 --> 48:34.368
And we'll meet
from time to time.

48:34.369 --> 48:36.746
A cup of tea.
Pint or two.

48:36.747 --> 48:39.875
It'll be business as usual.

48:53.597 --> 48:56.724
All the fun of being
in the field,

48:56.725 --> 49:00.020
but with the comforts of home.

49:08.612 --> 49:11.989
All you have to do

49:11.990 --> 49:14.201
is keep a secret.
