WEBVTT

00:47.589 --> 00:51.300
l come from a land
From a faraway place

00:51.384 --> 00:54.636
Where the caravan camels roam

00:54.721 --> 00:58.557
Where it's flat and immense
And the heat is intense

00:58.641 --> 01:02.144
It's barbaric, but hey, it's home

01:02.228 --> 01:05.731
When the wind's from the east
And the sun's from the west

01:05.815 --> 01:08.942
And the sand in the glass is right

01:09.027 --> 01:13.489
Come on down, stop on by
Hop a carpet and fly

01:13.573 --> 01:17.743
To another Arabian night

01:17.827 --> 01:21.580
Arabian nights

01:21.664 --> 01:25.292
Like Arabian days

01:25.376 --> 01:29.171
More often than not
Are hotter than hot

01:29.255 --> 01:32.883
In a lot of good ways

01:32.967 --> 01:36.386
Arabian nights

01:36.471 --> 01:40.224
'Neath Arabian moons

01:40.308 --> 01:44.353
A fool off his guard
Could fall and fall hard

01:44.437 --> 01:48.941
Out there on the dunes

01:52.821 --> 01:56.448
SaIaam and good evening
to you, worthy friend.

01:56.533 --> 01:58.408
Please, please, come closer.

01:59.577 --> 02:01.328
Too close. A little too close.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.038
There.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.457
Welcome to Agrabah,

02:05.542 --> 02:09.752
city of mystery, of enchantment,

02:09.838 --> 02:11.880
and the finest merchandise
this side of the River Jordan,

02:11.965 --> 02:14.007
on sale today. Come on down.

02:14.092 --> 02:15.676
Look at this. Yes.

02:15.760 --> 02:19.221
Combination hookah and coffeemaker.
Also makes julienne fries.

02:19.931 --> 02:22.015
Will not break. Will not. . .

02:22.100 --> 02:23.600
It broke.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.353
Look at this.

02:26.437 --> 02:29.314
I have never seen
one of these intact before.

02:29.399 --> 02:31.316
This is the famous
Dead Sea Tupperware.

02:31.401 --> 02:34.653
Listen. Still good.

02:35.321 --> 02:36.572
Wait. Don't go.

02:36.656 --> 02:40.576
I can see that you're only interested
in the exceptionally rare.

02:40.660 --> 02:44.746
I think, then, you would be
most rewarded to consider this.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.750
Do not be fooled
by its commonplace appearance.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.503
Like so many things,
it is not what is outside,

02:51.588 --> 02:54.339
but what is inside that counts.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.216
This is no ordinary lamp.

02:56.301 --> 02:59.136
It once changed the course
of a young man's life.

02:59.220 --> 03:03.432
A young man who, like this lamp,
was more than what he seemed.

03:03.516 --> 03:05.767
A diamond in the rough.

03:06.227 --> 03:08.395
Perhaps you would like to hear the tale?

03:08.479 --> 03:11.982
It begins on a dark night,

03:13.526 --> 03:16.653
where a dark man waits

03:16.738 --> 03:19.948
with a dark purpose.

03:24.954 --> 03:27.080
You are late.

03:27.290 --> 03:30.083
A thousand apologies, O patient one.

03:30.210 --> 03:31.376
You have it, then?

03:31.461 --> 03:34.796
I had to slit a few throats, but I got it.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.800
The treasure.

03:41.638 --> 03:45.557
Trust me, my pungent friend.

03:45.642 --> 03:49.186
-You'll get what's coming to you.
-What's coming to you.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.655
Quickly! Follow the trail.

04:03.952 --> 04:05.494
Faster.

04:24.889 --> 04:28.934
At last, after all my years of searching,

04:29.435 --> 04:31.853
the Cave of Wonders.

04:32.563 --> 04:33.939
Cave of Wonders.

04:34.023 --> 04:36.692
By Allah.

04:36.776 --> 04:40.946
Now, remember. Bring me the lamp.

04:41.030 --> 04:45.075
The rest of the treasure is yours,
but the lamp is mine.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.498
The lamp. The lamp.

04:51.582 --> 04:54.710
Jeez, where'd you dig this bozo up?

05:08.725 --> 05:13.270
Who disturbs my slumber?

05:14.397 --> 05:18.942
It is I, Gazeem, a humble thief.

05:19.027 --> 05:20.819
Know this.

05:20.903 --> 05:23.905
Only one may enter here,

05:23.990 --> 05:27.242
one whose worth lies far within.

05:27.410 --> 05:30.412
A diamond in the rough.

05:31.581 --> 05:33.582
What are you waiting for? Go on.

05:52.143 --> 05:53.685
No!

05:53.770 --> 05:59.900
Seek thee out the diamond in the rough.

06:04.489 --> 06:07.866
I can't believe it. I just don't believe it.

06:07.950 --> 06:12.245
We're never gonna get
a hold of that stupid lamp.

06:12.330 --> 06:16.833
Just forget it. Look at this.
I'm so ticked off that I'm moulting.

06:17.627 --> 06:21.254
Patience, Iago. Patience.

06:21.339 --> 06:24.633
Gazeem was obviously
less than worthy.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.260
There's a big surprise.

06:27.345 --> 06:32.015
I think I'm gonna have a heart attack
and die from that surprise.

06:32.100 --> 06:36.561
What are we gonna do?
We got a big problem here, a big. . .

06:36.646 --> 06:38.897
Yes.

06:38.981 --> 06:42.067
Only one may enter.

06:42.151 --> 06:44.444
I must find this one, this. . .

06:44.529 --> 06:47.155
Diamond in the rough.

06:48.157 --> 06:50.325
Stop! Thief!

06:50.576 --> 06:53.745
I'll have your hands for a trophy,
street rat.

06:54.580 --> 06:56.498
All this for a loaf of bread?

07:08.344 --> 07:11.763
-There he is!
-You won't get away so easy!

07:11.848 --> 07:13.849
You think that was easy?

07:15.476 --> 07:18.061
You two, over that way,
and you, follow me.

07:18.187 --> 07:20.439
-We'll find him.
-Morning, ladies.

07:20.523 --> 07:24.401
Getting into trouble a little early
today, aren't we, Aladdin?

07:24.485 --> 07:27.779
Trouble? No way.
You're only in trouble if you get caught.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.406
-Gotcha.
-I'm in trouble.

07:29.615 --> 07:30.866
And this time. . .

07:32.952 --> 07:34.786
Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.622
-Abu.
-Come on. Let's get outta here.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.417
Gotta keep one jump
Ahead of the bread line

07:40.501 --> 07:42.335
One swing ahead of the sword

07:42.420 --> 07:44.880
I steal only what I can't afford

07:44.964 --> 07:46.298
That's everything

07:46.382 --> 07:48.300
One jump ahead of the lawmen

07:48.384 --> 07:50.260
That's all, and that's no joke

07:50.344 --> 07:53.221
These guys don't appreciate I'm broke

07:53.806 --> 07:55.807
-Riffraff
-Street rat

07:55.892 --> 07:57.767
-Scoundrel
-Take that

07:57.852 --> 08:01.813
Just a little snack, guys

08:01.898 --> 08:05.817
Rip him open
Take it back, guys

08:05.902 --> 08:07.652
l can take a hint
Gotta face the facts

08:07.737 --> 08:09.821
-You're my only friend, Abu
-Who?

08:09.906 --> 08:13.658
lt's sad Aladdin's hit the bottom

08:13.743 --> 08:17.412
He's become a one-man rise in crime

08:17.580 --> 08:21.374
I'd blame parents
Except he hasn't got 'em

08:21.459 --> 08:23.168
Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat

08:23.252 --> 08:25.504
Tell you all about it
When I got the time

08:25.588 --> 08:29.341
One jump ahead of the slowpokes
One skip ahead of my doom

08:29.425 --> 08:31.718
Next time gonna use a nom de plume

08:31.802 --> 08:33.094
There he is

08:33.429 --> 08:37.307
One jump ahead of the hit men
One hit ahead of the flock

08:37.390 --> 08:40.268
l think l'll take a stroll
Around the block

08:40.937 --> 08:42.938
-Stop, thief
-Vandal

08:43.022 --> 08:44.773
-Abu
-Scandal

08:44.857 --> 08:49.069
Let's not be too hasty

08:49.153 --> 08:52.948
Still l think he's rather tasty

08:53.115 --> 08:54.991
Gotta eat to live
Gotta steal to eat

08:55.076 --> 08:56.493
Otherwise we'd get along

08:56.577 --> 08:58.119
Wrong

08:59.205 --> 09:00.455
Get him !

09:07.171 --> 09:08.964
He's got a sword !

09:09.549 --> 09:12.884
You idiots. We've all got swords.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.935
-One jump ahead of the hoof beats
-Vandal!

09:22.019 --> 09:23.770
-One hop ahead of the hump
-Street rat!

09:23.854 --> 09:25.730
-One trick ahead of disaster
-Scoundrel!

09:25.815 --> 09:27.649
They're quick, but I'm much faster

09:27.733 --> 09:29.276
Here goes, better throw my hand in

09:29.360 --> 09:32.821
Wish me happy landin'
All I gotta do is jump

09:46.586 --> 09:50.088
And now, esteemed effendi, we feast.
All right.

10:15.156 --> 10:18.158
Here. Go on. Take it.

10:33.758 --> 10:35.175
Don't.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.018
On his way to the palace, I suppose.

10:45.102 --> 10:48.146
Another suitor for the princess.

10:51.108 --> 10:53.985
Out of my way, you filthy brats.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.153
Hey!

10:55.237 --> 10:58.073
If I were as rich as you,
I could afford some manners.

10:59.158 --> 11:02.035
I'll teach you some manners.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.707
Look at that, Abu.

11:07.792 --> 11:10.919
It's not every day you see
a horse with two rear ends.

11:12.588 --> 11:15.131
You are a worthless street rat.

11:15.216 --> 11:18.760
You were born a street rat,
you'll die a street rat,

11:18.844 --> 11:21.888
and only your fleas will mourn you.

11:25.393 --> 11:26.976
I'm not worthless.

11:27.061 --> 11:29.187
And I don't have fleas.

11:32.566 --> 11:35.151
Come on, Abu. Let's go home.

11:42.284 --> 11:45.203
Riffraff, street rat

11:45.287 --> 11:47.914
I don't buy that

11:47.998 --> 11:52.460
If only they'd look closer

11:52.545 --> 11:55.672
Would they see a poor boy?

11:55.756 --> 11:57.340
No, siree

11:59.885 --> 12:03.054
They'd find out

12:03.139 --> 12:07.058
There's so much more

12:07.143 --> 12:12.856
To me

12:15.818 --> 12:19.195
Someday, Abu,
things are gonna change.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.157
We'll be rich, live in a palace,

12:22.241 --> 12:24.409
and never have any problems at all.

12:29.248 --> 12:30.999
I've never been so insulted.

12:31.083 --> 12:35.128
Prince Achmed.
You're not leaving so soon, are you?

12:35.212 --> 12:37.172
Good luck marrying her off.

12:38.632 --> 12:40.008
Jasmine.

12:41.260 --> 12:47.474
Jasmine!

12:47.892 --> 12:49.893
Confound it, Rajah.

12:52.897 --> 12:56.107
So, this is why
Prince Achmed stormed out.

12:56.192 --> 12:57.776
Oh, Father.

12:57.860 --> 13:00.612
Rajah was just playing with him.
Weren't you, Rajah?

13:00.696 --> 13:02.864
You were just playing
with that overdressed,

13:02.948 --> 13:05.784
self-absorbed Prince Achmed,
weren't you?

13:09.872 --> 13:14.292
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting
every suitor who comes to call.

13:14.376 --> 13:17.962
The law says
you must be married to a prince

13:18.047 --> 13:20.131
by your next birthday.

13:20.216 --> 13:21.674
The law is wrong.

13:21.759 --> 13:24.135
You've only got three more days.

13:24.220 --> 13:27.722
Father, I hate being forced into this.

13:27.848 --> 13:31.309
If I do marry, I want it to be for love.

13:31.393 --> 13:32.602
Jasmine,

13:33.354 --> 13:36.397
it's not only this law.

13:38.234 --> 13:42.237
I'm not going to be around forever,
and, well, I. . .

13:43.280 --> 13:47.242
I just want to make sure
you're taken care of.

13:47.326 --> 13:48.743
Provided for.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.995
Please try to understand.

13:51.080 --> 13:55.625
I've never done a thing on my own.
I've never had any real friends.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.461
Except you, Rajah.

13:59.755 --> 14:02.882
I've never even been outside
the palace walls.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.635
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.

14:05.719 --> 14:08.346
Then maybe I don't want
to be a princess any more.

14:11.559 --> 14:14.394
Allah forbid you should
have any daughters.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.869
I don't know where she gets it from.

14:30.953 --> 14:34.289
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.792
Jafar.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.461
My most trusted advisor.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.339
I am in desperate need of your wisdom.

14:43.424 --> 14:46.342
My life is but to serve you, my lord.

14:46.468 --> 14:50.722
It's this suitor business.
Jasmine refuses to choose a husband.

14:50.806 --> 14:53.975
-I'm at my wit's end.
-Wit's end !

14:56.478 --> 14:59.439
Have a cracker, pretty Polly.

15:00.316 --> 15:04.319
Your Majesty certainly
has a way with dumb animals.

15:05.529 --> 15:09.616
Now, then,
perhaps I can divine a solution

15:09.700 --> 15:11.659
to this thorny problem.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.494
If anyone can help, it's you.

15:13.579 --> 15:18.416
But it would require the use
of the mystic blue diamond.

15:19.710 --> 15:21.628
My ring?

15:21.712 --> 15:24.005
But it's been in the family for years.

15:24.089 --> 15:27.050
It is necessary to find
the princess a suitor.

15:27.509 --> 15:29.093
Don't worry.

15:29.678 --> 15:35.642
Everything will be fine.

15:35.726 --> 15:37.852
The diamond.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.271
Here, Jafar.

15:40.356 --> 15:43.942
Whatever you need will be fine.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.152
You are most gracious, my liege.

15:46.820 --> 15:50.448
Now, run along and play
with your little toys.

15:50.532 --> 15:54.369
Yes. That will be pretty good.

15:57.081 --> 15:59.332
I can't take it any more!

15:59.416 --> 16:05.046
If I gotta choke down on one more
of those mouldy, disgusting crackers. . .

16:07.800 --> 16:09.467
Calm yourself, Iago.

16:09.551 --> 16:10.969
Then I'd grab him around the head.

16:11.053 --> 16:15.348
Soon I will be sultan,
not that addlepated twit.

16:15.432 --> 16:19.560
And then I stuff the crackers
down his throat.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.499
I'm sorry, Rajah.

16:41.583 --> 16:45.378
But I can't stay here
and have my life lived for me.

16:46.755 --> 16:48.256
I'll miss you.

16:57.641 --> 16:59.559
Goodbye.

17:09.944 --> 17:11.695
Okay, Abu. Go.

17:13.949 --> 17:17.952
Try this. Your taste buds
will dance and sing.

17:19.454 --> 17:21.998
Get your paws off that.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.124
Why, you. . .

17:23.459 --> 17:27.086
Get away from here,
you cursed, filthy ape!

17:28.630 --> 17:30.131
Goodbye.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.300
Nice going, Abu.

17:33.677 --> 17:35.136
Breakfast is served.

17:39.975 --> 17:43.978
Pretty lady, buy a pot.
No finer pot in brass or silver.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.522
Sugar dates. Sugar dates and figs.

17:46.607 --> 17:48.900
Sugar dates and pistachios.

17:48.984 --> 17:50.735
Would the lady like a necklace?

17:50.819 --> 17:53.071
A pretty necklace for a pretty lady.

17:53.155 --> 17:54.655
Fresh fish !

17:54.740 --> 17:56.074
We catch 'em, you buy 'em !

17:56.158 --> 17:57.825
Oh, no. I don't think so.

18:00.120 --> 18:01.579
Excuse me.

18:05.834 --> 18:08.669
I'm really very sorry.

18:19.014 --> 18:21.015
Hello? Hello?

18:24.853 --> 18:26.521
You must be hungry.

18:26.855 --> 18:28.022
Here you go.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.109
You'd better be able to pay for that.

18:31.735 --> 18:34.737
-Pay?
-No one steals from my cart.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.698
I'm sorry, sir. I don't have any money.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.450
-Thief!
-Please. . .

18:39.535 --> 18:42.286
If you let me go to the palace,
I can get some from the sultan.

18:42.371 --> 18:45.414
Do you know
what the penalty is for stealing?

18:45.499 --> 18:46.999
No! No, please!

18:47.501 --> 18:51.129
Thank you, kind sir.
I'm so glad you found her.

18:51.213 --> 18:52.630
I've been looking all over for you.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.215
-What are you doing?
-Just play along.

18:54.299 --> 18:56.843
You know this girl?

18:56.927 --> 18:59.887
Sadly, yes. She is my sister.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.430
She's a little crazy.

19:01.515 --> 19:04.267
She said she knew the sultan.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.561
She thinks the monkey is the sultan.

19:09.064 --> 19:12.608
O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?

19:16.405 --> 19:18.281
Tragic, isn't it?

19:18.365 --> 19:20.575
But no harm done.

19:20.659 --> 19:23.286
Now, come along, sis.
Time to go see the doctor.

19:23.370 --> 19:25.663
Hello, Doctor. How are you?

19:25.747 --> 19:29.292
No, no, no. Not that one.
Come on, Sultan.

19:33.589 --> 19:34.714
What?

19:34.798 --> 19:37.091
Come back here, you little thieves!

19:41.597 --> 19:44.515
With all due respect, Your Rottenness,

19:44.600 --> 19:47.727
couldn't we just wait for a real storm?

19:47.936 --> 19:50.229
Save your breath, Iago. Faster.

19:51.190 --> 19:53.774
Yes, O mighty evil one.

19:57.154 --> 19:59.572
Part, sands of time.

19:59.656 --> 20:03.576
Reveal to me the one
who can enter the cave.

20:03.660 --> 20:06.787
Yes! Yes!

20:07.331 --> 20:09.707
There he is.

20:09.791 --> 20:12.084
My diamond in the rough.

20:12.169 --> 20:15.588
That's him? That's the clown
we've been waitin' for?

20:16.590 --> 20:22.136
Let's have the guards extend him
an invitation to the palace, shall we?

20:22.804 --> 20:24.430
Swell.

20:28.644 --> 20:30.603
Almost there.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.988
I want to thank you
for stopping that man.

20:42.074 --> 20:43.324
Forget it.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.620
So, this is your first time
in the marketplace?

20:50.374 --> 20:51.749
Is it that obvious?

20:52.459 --> 20:54.835
Well, you do kind of stand out.

20:56.672 --> 21:00.341
I mean, you don't seem to know
how dangerous Agrabah can be.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.512
I'm a fast learner.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.640
Hey.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.686
Come on. This way.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.981
Watch your head there.

21:15.065 --> 21:16.524
Be careful.

21:16.608 --> 21:18.234
Is this where you live?

21:18.694 --> 21:22.113
Yep. Just me and Abu.
Come and go as we please.

21:22.197 --> 21:23.948
That sounds fabulous.

21:24.032 --> 21:28.160
Well, it's not much,
but it's got a great view.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.831
The palace looks pretty amazing, huh?

21:33.458 --> 21:35.126
It's wonderful.

21:35.210 --> 21:37.503
I wonder what it would
be like to live there,

21:37.587 --> 21:40.256
and have servants and valets.

21:40.340 --> 21:43.634
Sure. People who tell you
where to go and how to dress.

21:45.053 --> 21:46.345
It's better than here.

21:46.430 --> 21:48.973
You're always scraping for food
and ducking the guards.

21:49.057 --> 21:51.309
You're not free
to make your own choices.

21:51.393 --> 21:53.769
-Sometimes you feel so. . .
-You're just. . .

21:53.854 --> 21:55.479
-Trapped.
-Trapped.

22:00.902 --> 22:02.987
So, where are you from?

22:03.905 --> 22:05.281
What does it matter?

22:05.365 --> 22:07.908
I ran away and I am not going back.

22:08.910 --> 22:12.079
-Really? How come?
-Why, you. . .

22:13.915 --> 22:16.417
My father's forcing me to get married.

22:17.336 --> 22:19.754
That's awful.

22:20.797 --> 22:22.089
Abu !

22:24.343 --> 22:25.760
What?

22:26.636 --> 22:30.014
Abu says that's not fair.

22:30.098 --> 22:31.182
What?

22:31.266 --> 22:34.018
-Oh, did he?
-Yeah, of course.

22:34.102 --> 22:38.147
And does Abu
have anything else to say?

22:38.231 --> 22:41.359
Well, he wishes there was something
he could do to help.

22:41.443 --> 22:42.985
Oh, boy.

22:45.614 --> 22:48.449
Tell him that's very sweet.

22:50.952 --> 22:52.536
Here you are.

22:52.621 --> 22:54.789
-They're after me!
-They're after you?

22:54.873 --> 22:56.207
My father must have sent them. . .

22:56.291 --> 22:57.458
-Do you trust me?
-What?

22:57.542 --> 23:00.127
-Do you trust me?
-Yes. . .

23:00.212 --> 23:01.629
Then jump!

23:07.135 --> 23:11.514
We just keep running into each other,
don't we, street rat?

23:12.557 --> 23:14.850
Run ! Go! Get out of here!

23:15.060 --> 23:16.852
Get this thing off of me!

23:17.604 --> 23:20.731
-It's the dungeon for you, boy.
-Get off of me.

23:20.816 --> 23:21.899
Let him go.

23:21.983 --> 23:24.944
Looky here, men. A street mouse.

23:26.446 --> 23:30.282
Unhand him, by order of the princess.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.202
Princess Jasmine.

23:33.495 --> 23:35.121
-The princess?
-Princess?

23:35.205 --> 23:38.416
What are you doing outside the palace?
And with this street rat.

23:38.500 --> 23:42.545
That's not your concern.
Do as I command. Release him.

23:42.629 --> 23:46.382
I would, Princess,
except my orders come from Jafar.

23:46.466 --> 23:50.177
-You'll have to take it up with him.
-Believe me, I will.

23:56.852 --> 23:58.519
Jafar?

23:59.229 --> 24:00.396
Princess.

24:01.231 --> 24:02.898
Jafar, I'm stuck.

24:02.983 --> 24:05.192
How may I be of service to you?

24:05.277 --> 24:08.320
The guards just took a boy
from the market, on your orders.

24:09.197 --> 24:12.616
Your father has charged me
with keeping peace in Agrabah.

24:12.701 --> 24:15.536
-The boy was a criminal.
-What was his crime?

24:15.662 --> 24:16.912
I can't breathe, Jafar.

24:16.997 --> 24:20.583
Why, kidnapping the princess,
of course.

24:20.667 --> 24:22.918
If you could just. . . That hurt!

24:23.003 --> 24:25.588
He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.

24:25.672 --> 24:27.756
Oh, dear.

24:29.050 --> 24:32.678
How frightfully upsetting.
Had I but known. . .

24:33.472 --> 24:34.597
What do you mean?

24:34.681 --> 24:38.309
Sadly, the boy's sentence
has already been carried out.

24:38.393 --> 24:39.643
What sentence?

24:40.061 --> 24:41.604
Death.

24:41.688 --> 24:44.315
-By beheading.
-No.

24:47.277 --> 24:51.071
I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.

24:51.156 --> 24:52.907
How could you?

25:03.752 --> 25:05.419
So, how did it go?

25:05.504 --> 25:09.131
I think she took it rather well.

25:22.938 --> 25:25.231
It's all my fault, Rajah.

25:27.567 --> 25:30.611
I didn't even know his name.

25:49.464 --> 25:53.050
She was the princess. I can't believe it.

25:54.302 --> 25:56.387
I must have sounded so stupid to her.

25:57.806 --> 26:00.099
Aladdin ! Hello!

26:01.226 --> 26:02.977
Abu. Down here.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.398
Come on, help me out of these.

26:14.364 --> 26:17.866
Hey, she was in trouble.
She was worth it.

26:18.326 --> 26:19.702
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:19.786 --> 26:22.288
Don't worry, Abu.
I'll never see her again.

26:22.539 --> 26:25.165
I'm a street rat, remember?
And there's a law.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.668
She's gotta marry a prince.

26:28.628 --> 26:30.379
She deserves a prince.

26:32.090 --> 26:34.550
I'm a fool.

26:34.634 --> 26:38.178
You're only a fool if you give up, boy.

26:38.888 --> 26:40.306
Who are you?

26:40.390 --> 26:43.183
A lowly prisoner, like yourself.

26:43.268 --> 26:46.353
But together, perhaps we can be more.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.272
I'm listening.

26:48.356 --> 26:52.651
There is a cave, boy,
a Cave of Wonders,

26:52.736 --> 26:56.697
filled with treasures
beyond your wildest dreams.

26:58.366 --> 27:02.870
Treasure enough to impress
even your princess, I'd wager.

27:02.954 --> 27:05.623
Jafar, can you hurry up?
I'm dyin' in here.

27:05.707 --> 27:08.250
But the law says only a prince can. . .

27:08.335 --> 27:10.961
You've heard of the golden rule,
haven't you?

27:11.171 --> 27:13.756
Whoever has the gold makes the rules.

27:15.091 --> 27:18.135
Why would you share all of this
wonderful treasure with me?

27:18.219 --> 27:22.765
I need a young pair of legs
and a strong back to go in after it.

27:23.475 --> 27:24.808
One problem.

27:24.893 --> 27:27.061
It's out there. We're in here.

27:28.563 --> 27:32.191
Things aren't always what they seem.

27:33.068 --> 27:35.903
So, do we have a deal?

27:37.322 --> 27:39.156
I don't know.

27:50.752 --> 27:54.505
Who disturbs my slumber?

27:56.800 --> 27:59.051
It is I, Aladdin.

28:00.595 --> 28:03.097
Proceed.

28:03.223 --> 28:06.558
Touch nothing but the lamp.

28:07.185 --> 28:10.479
Remember, boy, first fetch me the lamp,

28:10.563 --> 28:14.441
and then you shall have your reward.

28:14.526 --> 28:16.276
Come on, Abu.

28:30.583 --> 28:32.376
Would you look at that!

28:35.839 --> 28:39.550
Just a handful of this stuff
would make me richer than the sultan.

28:40.635 --> 28:41.760
Abu !

28:43.388 --> 28:46.056
Don't touch anything.

28:46.141 --> 28:47.808
We gotta find that lamp.

29:18.840 --> 29:22.009
-Aladdin !
-Abu, will you knock it off?

29:45.700 --> 29:47.993
Abu, what are you, crazy?

29:50.830 --> 29:53.123
A magic carpet.

29:53.708 --> 29:56.960
Come on. Come on out.
We're not gonna hurt you.

30:06.554 --> 30:09.890
Hey, take it easy, Abu.
He's not gonna bite.

30:09.974 --> 30:11.058
Thanks.

30:18.900 --> 30:21.527
Wait a minute. Don't go.

30:21.611 --> 30:23.529
Maybe you can help us.

30:26.115 --> 30:27.533
Hey!

30:28.409 --> 30:30.244
You see, we're trying to find this lamp.

30:32.539 --> 30:35.415
I think he knows where it is.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.391
Wait here.

31:27.135 --> 31:28.719
This is it?

31:28.803 --> 31:31.305
This is what we came
all the way down here to. . .

31:31.931 --> 31:34.391
Abu ! No!

31:34.475 --> 31:36.685
Infidels!

31:37.562 --> 31:42.441
You have touched
the forbidden treasure!

31:43.985 --> 31:49.156
Now you will never again
see the light of day!

32:16.017 --> 32:18.936
Help! Help! Help!

32:20.855 --> 32:22.397
Gotcha!

32:26.027 --> 32:27.694
Carpet, let's move.

32:43.252 --> 32:44.795
Abu !

32:44.879 --> 32:47.214
Abu, this is no time to panic.

32:48.549 --> 32:49.633
Start panicking.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.083
-Help me out.
-Throw me the lamp.

33:23.167 --> 33:25.669
I can't hold on. Give me your hand.

33:25.753 --> 33:27.629
First give me the lamp.

33:33.720 --> 33:35.554
Yes!

33:35.638 --> 33:38.098
At last!

33:41.602 --> 33:42.686
What are you doing?

33:42.770 --> 33:45.355
Giving you your reward.

33:45.440 --> 33:49.443
Your eternal reward.

34:16.137 --> 34:17.888
It's mine.

34:17.972 --> 34:19.806
It's all mine.

34:20.516 --> 34:23.060
I. . . Where is it?

34:23.143 --> 34:24.436
No.

34:24.771 --> 34:27.272
No!

34:32.527 --> 34:33.652
Jasmine?

34:36.449 --> 34:37.824
Oh, dearest.

34:38.701 --> 34:40.159
What's wrong?

34:41.621 --> 34:44.206
Jafar has

34:44.290 --> 34:46.833
done something terrible.

34:46.918 --> 34:49.628
There, there, my dear.

34:49.712 --> 34:51.838
We'll set it right.

34:51.922 --> 34:54.549
Now, tell me everything.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.598
Aladdin. Wake up.

35:01.682 --> 35:02.974
Aladdin.

35:05.144 --> 35:06.353
My head.

35:09.524 --> 35:10.857
We're trapped.

35:10.942 --> 35:14.152
That two-faced son of a jackal !

35:15.404 --> 35:19.741
Whoever he was,
he's long gone with that lamp.

35:22.245 --> 35:24.579
Why, you hairy little thief.

35:25.373 --> 35:28.625
Looks like such a beat-up,
worthless piece of junk.

35:28.709 --> 35:31.086
Hey, I think there's
something written here,

35:31.170 --> 35:34.005
but it's hard to make out.

35:50.690 --> 35:55.902
1 0,000 years will give you
such a crick in the neck.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.404
Hang on a second.

36:00.241 --> 36:02.659
Does it feel good to be outta there.

36:02.743 --> 36:04.870
I'm telling you,
nice to be back, ladies and gentlemen.

36:04.954 --> 36:06.913
Hi. Where you from?
What's your name?

36:07.415 --> 36:08.540
Aladdin.

36:08.624 --> 36:11.626
Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin.
Nice to have you on the show.

36:11.711 --> 36:13.712
Can we call you Al?
Or maybe just Din?

36:13.796 --> 36:17.966
How about Laddie? Sounds like,
"Here, boy. C'mon, laddie."

36:18.926 --> 36:21.261
I must have hit my head
harder than I thought.

36:21.345 --> 36:24.181
Do you smoke? Mind if I do?

36:24.265 --> 36:26.892
Oh, sorry, Cheeta.
Hope I didn't singe the fur.

36:26.976 --> 36:29.561
Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen you
in a few millennia.

36:29.645 --> 36:33.190
Give me some tassel. Yeah. Yo, yo.

36:33.274 --> 36:37.027
Say, you're a lot smaller
than my last master.

36:37.111 --> 36:38.403
Either that or I'm gettin' bigger.

36:38.487 --> 36:40.614
Look at me from the side.
Do I look different to you?

36:40.698 --> 36:43.617
Wait a minute. I'm your master?

36:43.701 --> 36:46.786
That's right. He can be taught.
What would you wish of me?

36:46.871 --> 36:49.039
The ever impressive,

36:49.123 --> 36:52.334
the long contained,

36:52.418 --> 36:53.418
the often imitated,

36:53.502 --> 36:55.545
but never duplicated. . .

36:55.630 --> 36:57.714
Duplicated, duplicated. . .

36:57.798 --> 37:01.593
Genie of the Lamp!

37:01.677 --> 37:03.428
Right here direct from the lamp,

37:03.512 --> 37:06.097
right here
for your very much wish fulfilment.

37:06.182 --> 37:07.349
Thank you.

37:08.476 --> 37:10.769
-Wish fulfilment?
-Three wishes, to be exact.

37:10.853 --> 37:13.730
And ixnay on the wishing
for more wishes.

37:13.814 --> 37:15.857
That's it. Three.

37:16.567 --> 37:18.902
No substitutions, exchanges or refunds.

37:18.986 --> 37:20.195
Now I know I'm dreaming.

37:20.529 --> 37:24.157
Master, I don't think you quite realise
what you've got here.

37:24.242 --> 37:29.454
So why don't you just ruminate
whilst I illuminate the possibilities.

37:30.706 --> 37:33.416
Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves

37:33.501 --> 37:35.252
Scheherazade had a thousand tales

37:35.711 --> 37:38.088
But, master, you're in luck
'Cause up your sleeves

37:38.172 --> 37:40.423
You got a brand of magic never fails

37:40.508 --> 37:43.009
You got some power
In your corner now

37:43.094 --> 37:45.345
Some heavy ammunition in your camp

37:45.429 --> 37:47.847
You got some punch, pizzazz
Yahoo and how

37:47.932 --> 37:51.059
See, all you gotta do
Is rub that lamp and I'll say

37:51.143 --> 37:55.230
"Mr Aladdin, sir
What will your pleasure be?"

37:55.314 --> 37:57.691
Let me take your order
Jot it down

37:57.775 --> 37:59.693
You ain't never had a friend like me

38:00.987 --> 38:05.031
Life is your restaurant
And I'm your maitre d'

38:05.116 --> 38:07.492
Come on, whisper what it is you want

38:07.576 --> 38:09.619
You ain't never had a friend like me

38:09.704 --> 38:12.372
Yes, sir
We pride ourselves on service

38:12.456 --> 38:15.000
You're the boss, the king, the shah

38:15.084 --> 38:17.460
Say what you wish
It's yours, true dish

38:17.545 --> 38:20.588
How 'bout a little more baklava?

38:20.673 --> 38:24.926
Have some of column A
Try all of column B

38:25.011 --> 38:27.304
I'm in the mood to help you, dude

38:27.388 --> 38:29.723
You ain't never had a friend like me

38:31.392 --> 38:33.685
Oh, my

38:33.769 --> 38:36.104
No, no

38:36.188 --> 38:37.564
My, my

38:38.941 --> 38:41.359
Can your friends do this?

38:41.444 --> 38:43.820
Can your friends do that?

38:43.904 --> 38:46.281
Can your friends pull this

38:46.365 --> 38:48.825
Out their little hat?

38:48.909 --> 38:51.161
Can your friends go...

38:51.245 --> 38:53.121
Hey, looky here

38:53.789 --> 38:56.958
Can your friends go
"Abracadabra, let her rip"

38:57.043 --> 38:59.169
And then make the sucker disappear?

38:59.337 --> 39:01.838
So don't you sit there
Slack-jawed, buggy-eyed

39:01.922 --> 39:03.965
l'm here to answer
All your midnight prayers

39:04.050 --> 39:06.509
You got me bona fide certified

39:06.594 --> 39:08.845
You got a genie
For your charge d'affaires

39:08.929 --> 39:11.181
I got a powerful urge to help you out

39:11.265 --> 39:13.516
So what's your wish?
I really wanna know

39:13.601 --> 39:15.852
You got a list
That's three miles long, no doubt

39:15.936 --> 39:18.897
All you gotta do is rub like so

39:18.981 --> 39:23.109
Mr Aladdin, sir
Have a wish or two or three

39:23.194 --> 39:25.653
I'm on the job, you big nabob

39:25.738 --> 39:30.367
You ain't never had a friend
Never had a friend

39:30.451 --> 39:34.662
You ain't never had a friend

39:34.747 --> 39:37.957
Like me

39:42.797 --> 39:45.924
You ain't never had a friend like me

39:51.639 --> 39:52.931
So, what'll it be, master?

39:53.641 --> 39:57.268
You're gonna grant me
any three wishes I want, right?

39:57.353 --> 39:58.561
Almost.

39:58.646 --> 40:01.731
There are a few provisos,
a couple of quid pro quos.

40:01.816 --> 40:02.941
Like?

40:03.150 --> 40:06.194
Rule number one, I can't kill anybody.

40:06.278 --> 40:07.612
So don't ask.

40:07.696 --> 40:08.947
Rule number two.

40:09.031 --> 40:12.659
I can't make anybody
fall in love with anybody else.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.245
You little ponem there.

40:15.329 --> 40:19.916
Rule number three. I can't bring
people back from the dead.

40:20.000 --> 40:22.836
It's not a pretty picture.
I don't like doing it.

40:23.462 --> 40:25.505
Other than that, you got it.

40:29.343 --> 40:32.429
Provisos? You mean limitations?

40:32.513 --> 40:35.598
On wishes? Some all-powerful genie.

40:36.183 --> 40:38.476
Can't even bring people
back from the dead.

40:38.561 --> 40:41.980
I don't know, Abu. He probably
can't even get us out of this cave.

40:42.064 --> 40:44.482
Looks like we're gonna have to
find a way out of here.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.484
Excuse me?

40:46.569 --> 40:49.362
Are you lookin' at me?
Did you rub my lamp?

40:49.447 --> 40:52.449
Did you wake me up?
Did you bring me here?

40:52.533 --> 40:54.534
And all of sudden
you're walking out on me?

40:54.618 --> 40:57.454
I don't think so, not right now.

40:57.538 --> 40:59.956
You're gettin' your wishes, so sit down !

41:01.208 --> 41:02.292
In case of emergency,

41:02.376 --> 41:04.878
the exits are here, here,
here, here, anywhere.

41:04.962 --> 41:07.297
Keep your hands and arms
inside the carpet.

41:07.381 --> 41:09.257
We're. . .

41:10.384 --> 41:12.802
Outta here!

41:14.305 --> 41:16.973
Jafar, this is an outrage.

41:17.057 --> 41:19.851
If it weren't for all your years
of loyal service. . .

41:19.935 --> 41:24.314
From now on, you are to discuss
sentencing of prisoners with me,

41:24.398 --> 41:26.900
before they are beheaded.

41:26.984 --> 41:29.903
I assure you, Your Highness,
it won't happen again.

41:30.029 --> 41:31.404
Jasmine. . .

41:31.530 --> 41:36.284
Jafar. Let's put this whole
messy business behind us.

41:36.368 --> 41:37.494
Please.

41:37.578 --> 41:42.123
My most abject and humblest apologies
to you as well, Princess.

41:42.208 --> 41:45.084
At least some good will come
of my being forced to marry.

41:45.377 --> 41:49.672
When I am queen,
I will have the power to get rid of you.

41:51.175 --> 41:53.468
There, now. That's nice.
All settled, then.

41:53.552 --> 41:57.680
Now, Jasmine, getting back
to this suitor business. . . Jasmine?

41:58.307 --> 41:59.682
Jasmine!

42:01.644 --> 42:04.938
If only I had gotten that lamp.

42:05.022 --> 42:08.107
"I will have the power to get rid of you."

42:09.068 --> 42:11.778
To think we gotta keep kissing up

42:11.862 --> 42:15.532
to that chump and his chump daughter

42:15.616 --> 42:18.117
-for the rest of our lives. . .
-No, Iago.

42:18.202 --> 42:21.996
Only until she finds a chump husband.

42:22.289 --> 42:23.915
Then she'll have us banished.

42:24.833 --> 42:26.584
Or beheaded.

42:29.713 --> 42:31.631
Wait a minute. Jafar.

42:31.715 --> 42:34.551
What if you were the chump husband?

42:34.635 --> 42:35.843
What?

42:35.928 --> 42:39.222
Okay, you marry the princess, all right?

42:39.306 --> 42:42.809
And then you become the sultan.

42:44.728 --> 42:47.230
Marry the shrew.

42:47.314 --> 42:49.107
I become the sultan.

42:49.191 --> 42:53.069
-The idea has merit.
-Yes, merit. Yes.

42:53.153 --> 42:59.659
And then we drop papa-in-law
and the little woman off a cliff.

43:05.165 --> 43:08.668
I love the way
your foul little mind works.

43:17.845 --> 43:21.598
Thank you for choosing Magic Carpet
for all your travel needs.

43:21.682 --> 43:25.268
Don't stand until the rug
has come to a complete stop.

43:25.352 --> 43:28.479
Thank you. Goodbye now.
Good-bye. Thank you.

43:28.564 --> 43:32.692
Well, how about that,
Mr Doubting Mustafa?

43:33.027 --> 43:37.697
You sure showed me.
Now, about my three wishes.

43:37.865 --> 43:39.907
Dost mine ears deceive me?

43:39.992 --> 43:43.077
Three? You are down by one, boy.

43:43.579 --> 43:46.956
No. I never actually wished
to get out of the cave.

43:47.041 --> 43:48.791
You did that on your own.

43:50.961 --> 43:53.087
Well, I feel sheepish.

43:53.213 --> 43:56.382
All right, you bad boy,
but no more freebies.

43:56.508 --> 43:59.636
Fair deal. So, three wishes.

43:59.720 --> 44:01.846
I want them to be good.

44:01.930 --> 44:03.640
What would you wish for?

44:03.724 --> 44:05.099
Me?

44:05.893 --> 44:07.977
No one's ever asked me that before.

44:08.062 --> 44:11.356
Well, in my case. . . Forget it.

44:11.440 --> 44:12.982
-What?
-No, I can't. I. . .

44:13.067 --> 44:15.485
Come on. Tell me.

44:15.569 --> 44:17.403
Freedom.

44:17.488 --> 44:18.529
You're a prisoner?

44:18.614 --> 44:20.990
It's all part and parcel
of the whole genie gig.

44:21.075 --> 44:24.744
Phenomenal cosmic powers. . .

44:24.828 --> 44:26.245
Itty bitty living space.

44:26.330 --> 44:28.498
Genie, that's terrible.

44:28.582 --> 44:31.668
But to be free. . .

44:31.752 --> 44:33.628
Not have to go, "What do you need?

44:33.712 --> 44:36.172
"What do you need?
What do you need?"

44:36.256 --> 44:38.174
To be my own master.

44:38.258 --> 44:41.135
Such a thing would be greater
than all the magic

44:41.220 --> 44:44.514
and all the treasures in all the world.

44:44.598 --> 44:45.890
But what am I talking about?

44:45.974 --> 44:48.351
Let's get real here.
It's not gonna happen.

44:48.435 --> 44:50.812
Genie, wake up and smell the hummus.

44:50.938 --> 44:52.146
Why not?

44:52.231 --> 44:56.109
The only way I get outta this
is if my master wishes me out.

44:56.276 --> 44:58.736
So you can guess how often
that's happened.

44:58.821 --> 45:00.488
I'll do it. I'll set you free.

45:01.115 --> 45:04.742
-Yeah, right.
-No, really, I promise.

45:04.827 --> 45:06.411
After I make my first two wishes,

45:06.495 --> 45:08.788
I'll use my third wish to set you free.

45:09.665 --> 45:12.125
Well, here's hopin'. All right.

45:12.209 --> 45:14.335
Let's make some magic.

45:14.420 --> 45:17.130
So how 'bout it?
What is it you want most?

45:17.881 --> 45:21.300
Well, there's this girl.

45:21.385 --> 45:22.427
Wrong.

45:22.511 --> 45:25.263
I can't make anybody
fall in love, remember?

45:25.347 --> 45:29.726
But, Genie, she's smart and fun and. . .

45:29.810 --> 45:31.769
-Pretty?
-Beautiful.

45:31.854 --> 45:35.064
She's got these eyes that just. . .
And this hair.

45:35.149 --> 45:36.816
And her smile. . .

45:41.321 --> 45:43.364
But she's the princess.

45:43.449 --> 45:45.825
To even have a chance, I'd have to be. . .

45:45.909 --> 45:48.703
Hey, can you make me a prince?

45:48.871 --> 45:50.204
Let's see here.

45:50.289 --> 45:53.040
Chicken Ã  la king? Nope.

45:53.125 --> 45:56.294
Alaskan king crab.
I hate it when they do that.

45:56.378 --> 45:59.922
Caesar salad. Et tu, Brute? No.

46:00.007 --> 46:01.799
"To make a prince."

46:02.342 --> 46:04.677
Is that an official wish?
Say the magic words.

46:04.762 --> 46:07.597
Genie, I wish for you
to make me a prince.

46:07.681 --> 46:09.056
All right!

46:10.517 --> 46:14.562
First, that fez-and-vest combo
is much too third century.

46:14.646 --> 46:16.606
These patches.
What are we trying to say, beggar?

46:16.690 --> 46:18.900
No. Let's work with me here.

46:20.319 --> 46:21.652
I like it.

46:22.362 --> 46:25.448
Now, it still needs something.
What does it say to me?

46:25.532 --> 46:28.284
It says mode of transportation.

46:28.368 --> 46:32.413
Excuse me, monkey boy.
AquÃ­. Over here.

46:32.498 --> 46:33.539
Here he comes.

46:33.624 --> 46:36.501
What better way to make your
entrance on the streets of Agrabah

46:36.585 --> 46:40.171
than riding
your very own, brand-new camel?

46:40.255 --> 46:41.547
Watch out. They spit.

46:42.633 --> 46:43.633
Not enough.

46:44.885 --> 46:48.387
Still not enough.
Let's see. What do you need?

46:49.765 --> 46:50.932
Yes!

46:55.729 --> 46:58.356
Talk about your trunk space.
Check this action out.

47:06.198 --> 47:07.865
Abu, you look good.

47:07.950 --> 47:10.159
He's got the outfit.
He's got the elephant.

47:10.244 --> 47:12.245
But we're not through yet.

47:12.329 --> 47:16.874
Hang on to your turban, kid.
We're gonna make you a star.

47:25.217 --> 47:29.262
Sire, I've found a solution
to the problem with your daughter.

47:29.888 --> 47:31.764
The problem with your daughter.

47:32.599 --> 47:33.641
Really?

47:33.725 --> 47:35.059
Right here.

47:35.644 --> 47:39.522
"If the princess has not chosen
a husband by the appointed time,

47:39.606 --> 47:42.567
"then the sultan shall choose for her."

47:42.651 --> 47:45.903
But Jasmine hated all those suitors.

47:45.988 --> 47:47.989
How could I choose someone
she hates?

47:48.073 --> 47:50.449
Not to worry, my liege. There is more.

47:51.827 --> 47:54.829
"If in the event
a suitable prince cannot be found. . ."

47:54.913 --> 47:55.913
Jerk.

47:55.998 --> 47:59.458
"A princess must then be wed to. . ."

48:01.879 --> 48:03.087
Interesting.

48:03.213 --> 48:04.881
What? Who?

48:04.965 --> 48:06.507
The royal vizier.

48:06.592 --> 48:09.927
Why, that would be me.

48:11.555 --> 48:15.349
But I thought the law says
that only a prince can marry a princess.

48:15.434 --> 48:16.726
I'm quite sure that. . .

48:16.810 --> 48:20.438
Desperate times call
for desperate measures, my lord.

48:21.440 --> 48:23.983
Yes. Desperate measures.

48:24.610 --> 48:28.571
You will order the princess to marry me.

48:28.655 --> 48:33.367
I will order the princess to. . .

48:34.036 --> 48:36.412
But you're so old.

48:36.496 --> 48:39.624
The princess will marry me.

48:40.125 --> 48:41.626
The princess will marry. . .

48:42.419 --> 48:44.378
What? What is that?

48:44.463 --> 48:45.755
That music.

48:50.093 --> 48:52.678
Jafar, you must come and see this.

48:55.557 --> 48:59.518
Make way for Prince Ali

49:00.729 --> 49:06.442
Say, "Hey, it's Prince Ali"

49:06.568 --> 49:08.653
Hey, clear the way in the old bazaar

49:08.737 --> 49:11.322
Hey you, let us through
It's a bright new star

49:11.406 --> 49:14.992
Oh come, be the first on your block
To meet his eye

49:16.578 --> 49:19.163
Make way, here he comes
Ring bells, bang the drums

49:19.247 --> 49:21.040
You're gonna love this guy

49:21.291 --> 49:26.170
Prince Ali, fabulous he
Ali Ababwa

49:26.296 --> 49:30.383
Genuflect, show some respect
Down on one knee

49:31.218 --> 49:33.761
Now, try your best to stay calm

49:33.845 --> 49:35.930
Brush up your Sunday salaam

49:36.014 --> 49:40.434
Then come and meet
His spectacular coterie

49:40.519 --> 49:45.189
Prince Ali, mighty is he
Ali Ababwa

49:45.273 --> 49:49.193
Strong as 1 0 regular men definitely

49:50.237 --> 49:52.321
He faced the galloping hordes

49:52.572 --> 49:54.699
A hundred bad guys with swords

49:54.908 --> 49:59.161
Who sent those goons to their lords?
Why, Prince Ali

49:59.246 --> 50:02.498
He's got 75 golden camels

50:02.582 --> 50:04.041
Don't they look lovely, June?

50:04.126 --> 50:06.919
Purple peacocks, he's got 53

50:07.004 --> 50:08.587
Fabulous, Harry. I love the feathers.

50:08.672 --> 50:13.217
When it comes to exotic-type mammals

50:13.301 --> 50:15.177
Has he got a zoo
I'm telling you

50:15.262 --> 50:17.513
It's a world-class menagerie

50:17.597 --> 50:22.018
Prince Ali, handsome is he
Ali Ababwa

50:22.102 --> 50:26.814
That physique, how can I speak
Weak at the knee

50:26.898 --> 50:29.066
Well, get on out in that square

50:29.151 --> 50:31.318
Adjust your veil and prepare

50:31.403 --> 50:35.489
To gawk and grovel and stare
At Prince Ali

50:35.574 --> 50:39.660
-He's got 95 white Persian monkeys
-He's got the monkeys

50:39.745 --> 50:43.372
-Let's see the monkeys
-And to view them he charges no fee

50:43.457 --> 50:44.957
He's generous
So generous

50:45.042 --> 50:48.419
He's got slaves
He's got servants and flunkies

50:48.545 --> 50:51.172
Proud to work for him
They bow to his whim, love serving him

50:51.256 --> 50:55.217
They're just lousy with loyalty to Ali

50:55.302 --> 50:58.054
Prince Ali

50:58.138 --> 51:04.727
Prince Ali, Amorous he
Ali Ababwa

51:04.811 --> 51:09.148
Heard your princess
Was a sight lovely to see

51:09.232 --> 51:11.233
And that, good people, is why

51:11.318 --> 51:13.402
He got dolled up and dropped by

51:13.487 --> 51:15.404
With 60 elephants, llamas galore

51:15.489 --> 51:17.698
With bears and lions
A brass band and more

51:17.783 --> 51:19.450
With his 40 fakirs
His cooks, his bakers

51:19.534 --> 51:21.243
His birds that warble on key

51:21.328 --> 51:23.412
Make way

51:23.497 --> 51:29.710
For Prince Ali

51:30.962 --> 51:34.423
Splendid. Absolutely marvellous.

51:36.009 --> 51:37.968
Your Majesty,

51:38.053 --> 51:40.638
I have journeyed from afar
to seek your daughter's hand.

51:40.722 --> 51:42.473
Prince Ali Ababwa.

51:42.557 --> 51:45.643
Of course. I'm delighted to meet you.

51:45.727 --> 51:49.688
This is my royal vizier, Jafar.
He's delighted, too.

51:50.023 --> 51:51.690
Ecstatic.

51:51.775 --> 51:54.735
-I'm afraid, Prince Abubu. . .
-Ababwa.

51:54.820 --> 51:55.986
Whatever.

51:56.071 --> 51:59.156
You cannot just parade in here
uninvited and expect to. . .

51:59.241 --> 52:02.576
By Allah,
this is quite a remarkable device.

52:04.412 --> 52:07.581
I don't suppose I might. . .

52:08.083 --> 52:10.793
Why, certainly, Your Majesty.
Allow me.

52:12.337 --> 52:15.089
Sire, I must advise against this.

52:15.215 --> 52:18.175
Button up, Jafar.
Learn to have a little fun.

52:22.556 --> 52:24.265
Look out, here I come.

52:27.185 --> 52:31.397
Just where did you say you were from?

52:32.732 --> 52:36.235
Much farther than
you've travelled, I'm sure.

52:36.319 --> 52:38.571
-Try me.
-Look out, Polly.

52:41.158 --> 52:42.324
Hey, watch it.

52:42.409 --> 52:44.410
Watch it with the dumb rug.

52:54.671 --> 52:56.547
Out of the way. I'm coming in to land.

52:56.631 --> 52:58.465
Jafar, watch this.

52:58.550 --> 53:01.010
-Spectacular, Your Highness.
-That was lovely.

53:01.928 --> 53:05.764
Yes, I do seem to have a knack for it.

53:05.849 --> 53:08.225
This is a very impressive youth.

53:08.310 --> 53:10.561
And a prince besides.

53:10.645 --> 53:14.231
If we're lucky, you won't
have to marry Jasmine after all.

53:14.316 --> 53:17.026
-I don't trust him, Sire.
-Nonsense.

53:17.110 --> 53:21.697
One thing I pride myself on, Jafar,
I'm an excellent judge of character.

53:21.781 --> 53:24.450
Excellent judge. Yeah, sure. Not!

53:25.952 --> 53:28.078
Jasmine will like this one.

53:28.163 --> 53:30.331
And I'm pretty sure
I'll like Princess Jasmine.

53:30.415 --> 53:34.585
Your Highness, no.
I must intercede on Jasmine's behalf.

53:34.711 --> 53:36.879
This boy is no different from the others.

53:36.963 --> 53:39.673
What makes him think
he is worthy of the princess?

53:39.758 --> 53:43.010
Your Majesty, I am Prince Ali Ababwa.

53:43.094 --> 53:46.055
Just let her meet me.
I will win your daughter.

53:46.139 --> 53:47.681
How dare you.

53:47.891 --> 53:51.602
All of you.
Standing around deciding my future?

53:51.728 --> 53:54.480
I am not a prize to be won.

53:55.023 --> 53:56.857
Oh, dear.

53:57.901 --> 54:02.321
Don't worry, Prince Ali.
Just give Jasmine time to cool down.

54:02.530 --> 54:07.451
I think it's time to say good-bye
to Prince Abubu.

54:11.998 --> 54:13.207
What am I gonna do?

54:13.291 --> 54:15.668
Jasmine won't even let me talk to her.

54:15.752 --> 54:19.338
I should've known I couldn't pull off
this stupid prince wish.

54:22.759 --> 54:24.510
So move.

54:26.012 --> 54:27.012
Hey.

54:28.598 --> 54:30.099
That's a good move.

54:30.183 --> 54:32.518
I can't believe it. I'm losing to a rug.

54:33.520 --> 54:34.645
Genie, I need help.

54:34.729 --> 54:37.439
All right, Sparky, here's the deal.

54:37.524 --> 54:40.859
If you wanna court the little lady,
you gotta be a straight shooter.

54:40.944 --> 54:43.362
-Do you got it?
-What?

54:46.116 --> 54:47.324
No way.

54:47.409 --> 54:51.620
If Jasmine found out I was really
some crummy street rat,

54:51.705 --> 54:52.871
she'd laugh at me.

54:52.956 --> 54:55.416
A woman appreciates a man
who can make her laugh.

54:56.751 --> 55:01.088
Al, all joking aside,
you really ought to be yourself.

55:01.172 --> 55:03.090
Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be.

55:03.466 --> 55:05.301
Okay, I'm gonna go see her.

55:05.385 --> 55:09.555
I gotta be smooth, cool, confident.

55:11.057 --> 55:12.725
How do I look?

55:13.852 --> 55:16.395
Like a prince.

55:29.075 --> 55:30.409
Princess Jasmine?

55:32.412 --> 55:35.289
-Who's there?
-It's me, Prince Ali.

55:36.499 --> 55:38.917
Prince Ali Ababwa.

55:39.002 --> 55:40.586
I do not want to see you.

55:40.670 --> 55:42.963
No, no, please, Princess.
Give me a chance.

55:43.048 --> 55:45.799
-Just leave me alone.
-Down, kitty.

55:46.343 --> 55:48.427
So, how's our little beau doing?

55:49.846 --> 55:51.472
Good kitty, take off.

55:52.349 --> 55:53.474
Down, kitty.

55:53.558 --> 55:54.933
Wait. Wait.

55:55.018 --> 55:57.269
Do I know you?

55:57.937 --> 55:59.605
No. No.

56:00.231 --> 56:04.318
You remind me of someone
I met in the marketplace.

56:04.402 --> 56:06.779
The marketplace?

56:06.863 --> 56:09.198
I have servants who go
to the marketplace for me.

56:10.283 --> 56:13.869
Why, I even have servants who go to
the marketplace for my servants,

56:13.953 --> 56:15.537
so it couldn't have been me you met.

56:16.498 --> 56:19.958
No. I guess not.

56:20.168 --> 56:22.878
Enough about you, Casanova.
Talk about her.

56:22.962 --> 56:25.672
She's smart, fun, the hair, the eyes.

56:25.757 --> 56:27.341
Anything. Pick a feature.

56:28.134 --> 56:30.260
Princess Jasmine? You're very. . .

56:30.345 --> 56:32.054
Wonderful, magnificent, glorious,

56:32.138 --> 56:33.430
-punctual.
-Punctual.

56:33.515 --> 56:34.681
-Punctual?
-Sorry.

56:35.266 --> 56:37.267
-Beautiful.
-Nice recovery.

56:38.436 --> 56:40.020
I'm rich, too, you know.

56:40.814 --> 56:43.565
-Yeah.
-The daughter of a sultan.

56:43.900 --> 56:45.818
I know.

56:45.902 --> 56:48.821
A fine prize for any prince to marry.

56:49.864 --> 56:52.157
Right. Right. A prince like me.

56:52.242 --> 56:53.826
Warning ! Warning !

56:53.910 --> 56:55.994
Right. A prince like you.

56:56.704 --> 57:00.332
And every other stuffed shirt,
swaggering peacock I've met.

57:00.417 --> 57:02.126
Mayday! Mayday!

57:03.503 --> 57:06.004
Just go jump off a balcony!

57:06.172 --> 57:08.340
-What?
-Stop her. Stop her!

57:08.425 --> 57:10.217
-Want me to sting her?
-Buzz off.

57:10.301 --> 57:14.096
Okay, fine.
But remember, "bee" yourself.

57:14.180 --> 57:15.931
-Yeah, right.
-What?

57:17.475 --> 57:18.684
You're right.

57:20.645 --> 57:23.272
You aren't just some prize to be won.

57:23.940 --> 57:26.024
You should be free
to make your own choice.

57:26.776 --> 57:27.985
I'll go now.

57:28.069 --> 57:30.070
-No!
-What? What?

57:30.530 --> 57:31.947
How. . .

57:32.031 --> 57:33.699
How are you doing that?

57:33.783 --> 57:36.702
-It's a magic carpet.
-It's lovely.

57:38.163 --> 57:39.746
You. . .

57:39.831 --> 57:42.583
You don't want to go for a ride, do you?

57:42.667 --> 57:45.586
We could get out of the palace,
see the world.

57:45.670 --> 57:47.963
-Is it safe?
-Sure. Do you trust me?

57:49.799 --> 57:52.050
-What?
-Do you trust me?

57:54.554 --> 57:55.888
Yes.

58:11.613 --> 58:14.948
I can show you the world

58:15.658 --> 58:19.411
Shining, shimmering, splendid

58:19.496 --> 58:21.121
Tell me, Princess

58:21.247 --> 58:27.169
Now, when did you last
Let your heart decide

58:27.253 --> 58:31.131
I can open your eyes

58:31.257 --> 58:34.593
Take you wonder by wonder

58:35.011 --> 58:37.846
Over, sideways and under

58:37.931 --> 58:41.433
On a magic carpet ride

58:41.518 --> 58:45.437
A whole new world

58:45.522 --> 58:49.107
A new fantastic point of view

58:49.275 --> 58:54.029
No one to tell us no
Or where to go

58:54.113 --> 58:56.782
Or say we're only dreaming

58:56.866 --> 59:00.619
A whole new world

59:00.703 --> 59:04.706
A dazzling place
l never knew

59:04.791 --> 59:09.294
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear

59:09.379 --> 59:13.549
That now l'm in
A whole new world with you

59:13.633 --> 59:17.261
Now l'm in
A whole new world with you

59:17.345 --> 59:21.098
Unbelievable sights

59:21.266 --> 59:24.810
Indescribable feeling

59:24.894 --> 59:27.896
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling

59:27.981 --> 59:31.066
Through an endless diamond sky

59:31.192 --> 59:35.070
-A whole new world
-Don't you dare close your eyes

59:35.154 --> 59:38.907
-A hundred thousand things to see
-Hold your breath, it gets better

59:38.992 --> 59:43.245
I'm like a shooting star
l've come so far

59:43.329 --> 59:46.707
I can't go back to where I used to be

59:46.791 --> 59:50.002
-A whole new world
-Every turn a surprise

59:50.086 --> 59:54.089
-With new horizons to pursue
-Every moment red-letter

59:54.173 --> 59:58.677
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare

59:58.761 --> 01:00:05.434
Let me share
This whole new world with you

01:00:05.518 --> 01:00:09.229
-A whole new world
-A whole new world

01:00:09.314 --> 01:00:13.275
-That's where we'll be
-That's where we'll be

01:00:13.359 --> 01:00:17.571
-A thrilling chase
-A wondrous place

01:00:17.655 --> 01:00:21.366
For you and me

01:00:35.715 --> 01:00:38.759
-It's all so magical.
-Yeah.

01:00:41.220 --> 01:00:43.555
It's a shame Abu had to miss this.

01:00:43.723 --> 01:00:45.807
Nah. He hates fireworks.

01:00:45.975 --> 01:00:47.809
He doesn't like flying, either.

01:00:48.978 --> 01:00:51.897
That is. . . Oh, no.

01:00:51.981 --> 01:00:54.149
You are the boy from the market.
I knew it.

01:00:54.233 --> 01:00:56.568
-Why did you lie to me?
-Jasmine, I'm sorry.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.362
-Did you think I was stupid?
-No.

01:00:58.446 --> 01:01:00.364
-That I wouldn't figure it out?
-No.

01:01:00.448 --> 01:01:04.576
I mean, I hoped you wouldn't.
No, that's not what I meant.

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:06.662
Who are you? Tell me the truth.

01:01:06.746 --> 01:01:08.413
The truth?

01:01:10.583 --> 01:01:12.042
The truth.

01:01:13.586 --> 01:01:15.295
The truth is. . .

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:18.382
I sometimes dress as a commoner

01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:20.926
to escape the pressures of palace life.

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:25.013
But I really am a prince.

01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:28.392
Why didn't you just tell me?

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:31.061
Well, you know,

01:01:31.145 --> 01:01:33.689
royalty going out into the city
in disguise,

01:01:33.773 --> 01:01:36.274
it sounds a little strange,
don't you think?

01:01:38.236 --> 01:01:39.778
Not that strange.

01:02:02.635 --> 01:02:05.429
Good night, my handsome prince.

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:07.222
Sleep well, Princess.

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:32.873
Yes!

01:02:37.670 --> 01:02:41.423
For the first time in my life,
things are starting to go right.

01:02:45.970 --> 01:02:47.596
Abu. Abu.

01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:49.264
Hold him.

01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:57.355
I'm afraid you've worn out
your welcome, Prince Abubu.

01:02:57.690 --> 01:02:58.982
Why, you. . .

01:02:59.066 --> 01:03:01.526
Make sure he's never found.

01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:48.156
Never fails. You get in the bath
and there's a rub at the lamp.

01:03:48.241 --> 01:03:50.450
Hello? Al?

01:03:51.452 --> 01:03:53.620
Al ! Kid, snap out of it.

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:56.998
You can't cheat on this one.
I can't help unless you make a wish.

01:03:57.083 --> 01:04:00.585
You have to say, "Genie,
I want you to save my life." Got it?

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:02.838
Come on, Aladdin !

01:04:03.464 --> 01:04:04.881
I'll take that as a yes.

01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:08.093
Up scope.

01:04:18.062 --> 01:04:20.313
Don't you scare me like that.

01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:22.274
Genie, I. . .

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:25.235
I. . .

01:04:26.779 --> 01:04:29.030
-Thanks, Genie.
-Oh, Al.

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:31.199
I'm gettin' kind of fond of you, kid.

01:04:31.784 --> 01:04:34.160
Not that I wanna pick out
curtains or anything.

01:04:40.293 --> 01:04:42.085
Jasmine.

01:04:42.169 --> 01:04:46.089
Father, I just had
the most wonderful time.

01:04:46.173 --> 01:04:49.885
-I'm so happy.
-You should be, Jasmine.

01:04:49.969 --> 01:04:53.013
I have chosen a husband for you.

01:04:53.097 --> 01:04:55.765
-What?
-You will wed Jafar.

01:04:57.435 --> 01:05:00.604
You're speechless, I see.
A fine quality in a wife.

01:05:00.688 --> 01:05:02.480
I will never marry you.

01:05:03.065 --> 01:05:06.735
-Father, I choose Prince Ali.
-Prince Ali left.

01:05:06.819 --> 01:05:08.945
Better check
your crystal ball again, Jafar.

01:05:09.030 --> 01:05:10.739
Prince Ali !

01:05:10.823 --> 01:05:13.325
How in the. . .

01:05:13.951 --> 01:05:17.329
Tell them the truth, Jafar.
You tried to have me killed.

01:05:17.413 --> 01:05:20.498
What? Ridiculous nonsense,
Your Highness.

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:22.709
He is obviously lying.

01:05:22.793 --> 01:05:25.211
Obviously lying.

01:05:25.296 --> 01:05:27.339
Father, what's wrong with you?

01:05:27.423 --> 01:05:29.049
I know what's wrong.

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:32.260
Oh, my!

01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:35.055
Your Highness,
Jafar's been controlling you with this.

01:05:35.848 --> 01:05:38.099
What? Jafar?

01:05:38.184 --> 01:05:40.602
You, you traitor!

01:05:40.686 --> 01:05:42.812
Your Majesty, all this can be explained.

01:05:42.897 --> 01:05:44.940
Guards! Guards!

01:05:45.024 --> 01:05:47.150
Well, that's it. We're dead. Forget it.

01:05:47.234 --> 01:05:49.110
Just dig a grave for both of us.
We're dead.

01:05:49.195 --> 01:05:51.363
Arrest Jafar at once.

01:05:52.323 --> 01:05:54.532
This is not done yet, boy.

01:05:58.454 --> 01:06:01.957
Find him ! Search everywhere!

01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:04.542
-Jasmine, are you all right?
-Yes.

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:07.587
Jafar, my most trusted counsellor,

01:06:07.672 --> 01:06:09.172
plotting against me all this time.

01:06:09.256 --> 01:06:11.591
This is horrible, just horrible.

01:06:11.676 --> 01:06:13.760
How will I ever. . .

01:06:16.222 --> 01:06:17.806
Can this be true?

01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:21.434
My daughter has finally
chosen a suitor?

01:06:22.812 --> 01:06:24.688
Praise Allah !

01:06:26.023 --> 01:06:28.566
You brilliant boy, I could kiss you.

01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:30.735
I won't. I'll leave that to my. . .

01:06:31.404 --> 01:06:33.822
But you two will be wed at once.

01:06:33.906 --> 01:06:37.075
Yes, yes. And you'll be happy
and prosperous,

01:06:37.159 --> 01:06:40.453
and then you, my boy,
will become sultan.

01:06:40.538 --> 01:06:41.705
-Sultan?
-Yes.

01:06:41.789 --> 01:06:44.040
A fine upstanding youth
such as yourself,

01:06:44.125 --> 01:06:46.501
a person of your unimpeachable
moral character

01:06:46.585 --> 01:06:49.754
is exactly what this kingdom needs.

01:06:50.464 --> 01:06:54.092
We gotta get outta here.
I gotta start packing. Only essentials.

01:06:54.176 --> 01:06:55.176
We gotta travel light.

01:06:55.261 --> 01:06:58.513
Bring the guns, the weapons,
the knives, and how about this picture?

01:06:58.597 --> 01:07:01.016
I think I'm making a weird face in it.

01:07:04.311 --> 01:07:07.939
Oh, boy. He's cracked. He's gone nuts.

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:11.609
Jafar! Jafar! Get a grip!

01:07:12.695 --> 01:07:13.695
Good grip.

01:07:13.779 --> 01:07:17.699
Prince Ali is nothing more than
that ragged urchin, Aladdin.

01:07:17.783 --> 01:07:20.910
-He has the lamp, Iago.
-Why, that miserable. . .

01:07:20.995 --> 01:07:23.580
But you are going to relieve him of it.

01:07:23.664 --> 01:07:24.748
Me?

01:07:28.669 --> 01:07:30.670
Sultan?

01:07:30.755 --> 01:07:32.088
They want me to be Sultan?

01:07:35.092 --> 01:07:37.802
Hail the conquering hero

01:07:45.478 --> 01:07:48.396
Aladdin, you've just won
the heart of the princess.

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:50.523
What are you gonna do next?

01:07:57.323 --> 01:08:01.034
Your line is,
"I'm going to free the genie."

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:02.744
Any time.

01:08:02.828 --> 01:08:06.206
-Genie. I can't.
-Sure you can.

01:08:06.290 --> 01:08:09.709
You just go, "Genie, I wish you free."

01:08:09.794 --> 01:08:11.377
I'm serious.

01:08:11.462 --> 01:08:15.090
Look, I'm sorry. I really am.
But they wanna make me sultan.

01:08:15.174 --> 01:08:18.259
No. They wanna make Prince Ali sultan.

01:08:18.344 --> 01:08:20.886
Without you, I'm just Aladdin.

01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:23.305
-Al, you won.
-Because of you.

01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:26.935
The only reason anyone thinks
I'm worth anything is because of you.

01:08:27.019 --> 01:08:29.187
What if they find out
I'm not really a prince?

01:08:29.270 --> 01:08:32.439
What if Jasmine finds out? I'd lose her.

01:08:32.942 --> 01:08:35.944
Genie, I can't keep this up on my own.

01:08:36.612 --> 01:08:38.779
I can't wish you free.

01:08:40.407 --> 01:08:43.868
Fine. I understand.
After all, you've lied to everyone else.

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:46.037
Hey, I was beginning to feel left out.

01:08:46.538 --> 01:08:49.332
Now, if you'll excuse me, master.

01:08:53.546 --> 01:08:55.462
Genie, I'm really sorry.

01:08:56.506 --> 01:09:00.301
Well, fine. Then just stay in there.

01:09:02.095 --> 01:09:03.888
What are you guys looking at?

01:09:07.434 --> 01:09:09.519
Look, I'm sorry.

01:09:09.603 --> 01:09:11.770
Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't. . .

01:09:11.856 --> 01:09:13.773
Wait. Come on.

01:09:19.613 --> 01:09:21.238
What am I doing?

01:09:23.533 --> 01:09:25.577
Genie's right.

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:28.287
I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.

01:09:28.372 --> 01:09:31.541
Ali. Ali. Will you come here?

01:09:32.626 --> 01:09:34.877
Well, here goes.

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:37.380
Jasmine? Where are you?

01:09:38.131 --> 01:09:40.008
Out in the menagerie. Hurry.

01:09:40.091 --> 01:09:42.093
I'm coming.

01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:48.600
You got a problem, Pinky?

01:09:48.934 --> 01:09:50.059
Jerk.

01:09:53.104 --> 01:09:55.565
Boy, Jafar's gonna be happy to see you.

01:09:55.649 --> 01:09:58.568
"Excellent work, Iago." Go on.

01:09:58.652 --> 01:10:02.488
"No, really. On a scale
of one to 1 0, you are an 1 1 ."

01:10:02.573 --> 01:10:04.908
Jafar, you're too kind.

01:10:04.992 --> 01:10:06.910
I'm embarrassed. I'm blushing.

01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.705
People of Agrabah,

01:10:10.789 --> 01:10:15.543
my daughter has finally
chosen a suitor.

01:10:16.837 --> 01:10:18.087
Jasmine.

01:10:18.172 --> 01:10:20.131
Ali, where have you been?

01:10:20.424 --> 01:10:22.383
Jasmine, there's something
I got to tell you.

01:10:22.468 --> 01:10:25.511
The whole kingdom's turned out
for Father's announcement.

01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:28.097
No. But, Jasmine, listen to me, please.

01:10:28.182 --> 01:10:29.724
-You don't understand. . .
-Good luck.

01:10:29.808 --> 01:10:32.727
Ali Ababwa!

01:10:32.811 --> 01:10:34.354
Oh, boy.

01:10:37.316 --> 01:10:41.486
Look at them,
cheering that little pipsqueak.

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:43.988
Let them cheer.

01:10:45.199 --> 01:10:47.742
You know, Al, I'm getting really. . .

01:10:47.826 --> 01:10:50.578
I don't think you're him.
Tonight, the part of Al

01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:53.414
will be played by a tall, dark
and sinister ugly man.

01:10:53.499 --> 01:10:56.834
-I am your master now.
-I was afraid of that.

01:10:56.919 --> 01:11:00.171
Genie, grant me my first wish.

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:03.841
I wish to rule on high as sultan.

01:11:09.223 --> 01:11:11.307
Bless my soul.

01:11:11.392 --> 01:11:14.185
What is this? What's going on?

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:16.437
Oh, my goodness, what's happening?

01:11:16.522 --> 01:11:17.855
Father.

01:11:20.484 --> 01:11:23.611
Jafar, you vile betrayer.

01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:26.781
That's Sultan Vile Betrayer to you.

01:11:26.865 --> 01:11:30.076
Oh, yeah? We'll just see about that.

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:31.953
The lamp.

01:11:32.371 --> 01:11:35.373
Finders keepers, Abubu.

01:11:50.639 --> 01:11:52.515
Genie, no!

01:11:52.599 --> 01:11:55.226
Sorry, kid. I got a new master now.

01:11:56.562 --> 01:11:59.063
Jafar, I order you to stop.

01:11:59.189 --> 01:12:01.524
But there's a new order now.

01:12:01.608 --> 01:12:03.359
My order.

01:12:03.444 --> 01:12:06.487
Finally, you will bow to me.

01:12:06.655 --> 01:12:08.281
We will never bow to you.

01:12:08.365 --> 01:12:10.658
Why am I not surprised?

01:12:10.743 --> 01:12:13.244
If you won't bow before a sultan,

01:12:13.329 --> 01:12:16.497
then you will cower before a sorcerer!

01:12:16.582 --> 01:12:18.666
Genie, my second wish. . .

01:12:18.917 --> 01:12:24.839
I wish to be the most powerful sorcerer
in the world !

01:12:24.923 --> 01:12:27.091
Genie, stop!

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:30.178
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:12:30.262 --> 01:12:35.641
a warm Agrabah welcome
for Sorcerer Jafar!

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:37.935
Now, where were we?

01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:42.273
Yes. Abject humiliation.

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:45.943
Down, boy.

01:12:48.238 --> 01:12:49.530
Princess.

01:12:49.615 --> 01:12:52.575
There's someone
I'm dying to introduce you to.

01:12:52.659 --> 01:12:54.118
Jafar. Get your hands off her.

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:56.287
Prince Ali
Yes, it is he

01:12:56.455 --> 01:12:58.748
But not as you know him

01:12:58.832 --> 01:13:02.919
Read my lips
And come to grips with reality

01:13:03.754 --> 01:13:05.922
Yes, meet a blast from your past

01:13:06.006 --> 01:13:08.383
Whose lies were too good to last

01:13:08.467 --> 01:13:11.761
Say hello
To your precious Prince Ali

01:13:11.845 --> 01:13:14.555
Or should we say Aladdin?

01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.723
Ali?

01:13:15.808 --> 01:13:19.102
Jasmine, I tried to tell you. I'm just. . .

01:13:19.186 --> 01:13:23.564
So Ali turns out to be
Merely Aladdin

01:13:23.649 --> 01:13:25.650
Just a con, need I go on

01:13:25.734 --> 01:13:28.194
Take it from me

01:13:28.278 --> 01:13:30.405
His personality flaws

01:13:30.489 --> 01:13:32.532
Give me adequate cause

01:13:32.616 --> 01:13:34.575
To send him packing
On a one-way trip

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:35.660
Genie!

01:13:35.744 --> 01:13:37.245
So his prospects
Take a terminal dip

01:13:37.329 --> 01:13:41.999
His assets frozen, the venue chosen
ls the ends of the Earth!

01:13:43.085 --> 01:13:45.711
-So long !
-Good-bye, see ya.

01:13:45.796 --> 01:13:50.842
Ex-Prince Ali

01:14:15.617 --> 01:14:17.618
Abu.

01:14:18.829 --> 01:14:20.288
Abu !

01:14:24.668 --> 01:14:26.794
This is all my fault.

01:14:26.879 --> 01:14:30.465
I should have freed the genie
when I had the chance.

01:14:30.549 --> 01:14:33.342
Abu. Are you okay?

01:14:34.845 --> 01:14:37.096
I'm sorry, Abu.

01:14:37.181 --> 01:14:39.223
I made a mess of everything.

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:43.186
Somehow, I gotta go back
and set things right.

01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:52.195
Carpet.

01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:58.784
Abu, start digging.

01:15:01.330 --> 01:15:02.705
That's it.

01:15:20.182 --> 01:15:23.059
Yeah ! All right!

01:15:28.982 --> 01:15:31.317
Now, back to Agrabah. Let's go.

01:15:34.321 --> 01:15:36.948
Puppet ruler want a cracker?

01:15:37.032 --> 01:15:40.117
Here's your cracker. Shove them
all the way down your throat.

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:41.494
Here. Have lots.

01:15:41.578 --> 01:15:45.164
Stop it. Jafar, leave him alone.

01:15:47.334 --> 01:15:51.254
It pains me to see you
reduced to this, Jasmine.

01:15:53.215 --> 01:15:55.466
A beautiful desert bloom
such as yourself

01:15:55.551 --> 01:15:59.303
should be on the arm of the most
powerful man in the world.

01:15:59.763 --> 01:16:01.597
What do you say, my dear?

01:16:01.682 --> 01:16:04.225
Why, with you as my queen. . .

01:16:04.309 --> 01:16:05.685
Never.

01:16:07.187 --> 01:16:09.647
I'll teach you some respect.

01:16:12.150 --> 01:16:14.193
No. Genie.

01:16:15.487 --> 01:16:17.822
I have decided to make my final wish.

01:16:18.156 --> 01:16:20.950
I wish for Princess Jasmine

01:16:21.034 --> 01:16:23.953
to fall desperately in love with me.

01:16:30.168 --> 01:16:33.629
Master, there are a few addendas,
some quid pro quos. . .

01:16:33.714 --> 01:16:35.798
Don't talk back to me, you big blue lout.

01:16:36.174 --> 01:16:41.012
You will do what I order you to do, slave.

01:16:41.305 --> 01:16:43.514
Jafar.

01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:50.021
I never realised how
incredibly handsome you are.

01:16:52.691 --> 01:16:54.233
That's better.

01:16:55.485 --> 01:16:58.279
Now, pussycat,

01:16:58.363 --> 01:17:01.282
tell me more about myself.

01:17:01.366 --> 01:17:05.870
You're tall, dark,

01:17:07.164 --> 01:17:08.956
well dressed. . .

01:17:09.041 --> 01:17:11.375
Al. Al, little buddy.

01:17:16.048 --> 01:17:17.715
Al, I can't help you.

01:17:17.799 --> 01:17:20.801
I work for SeÃ±or Psychopath now.
What are you gonna do?

01:17:20.886 --> 01:17:24.805
Hey, I'm a street rat, remember?
I'll improvise.

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:27.933
Cute little gaps between your teeth.

01:17:28.852 --> 01:17:30.478
Go on.

01:17:30.562 --> 01:17:35.983
And your beard is so twisted.

01:17:37.527 --> 01:17:41.739
-You've stolen my heart.
-Jafar. . .

01:17:41.823 --> 01:17:45.493
And the street rat?

01:17:45.577 --> 01:17:47.578
What street rat?

01:17:59.383 --> 01:18:01.050
That was. . .

01:18:03.845 --> 01:18:05.513
You !

01:18:06.056 --> 01:18:09.350
How many times
do I have to kill you, boy?

01:18:13.271 --> 01:18:14.438
Get the lamp.

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:17.400
No!

01:18:18.276 --> 01:18:20.861
Princess. Your time is up.

01:18:24.491 --> 01:18:25.825
Jasmine.

01:18:27.452 --> 01:18:29.161
Nice shot. . .

01:18:31.123 --> 01:18:33.332
Don't toy with me.

01:18:34.668 --> 01:18:35.710
Abu !

01:18:35.794 --> 01:18:38.963
Things are unravelling fast now, boy.

01:18:41.925 --> 01:18:43.551
Get the point?

01:18:49.391 --> 01:18:51.434
I'm just getting warmed up.

01:18:54.521 --> 01:18:57.815
Are you afraid to fight me yourself,
you cowardly snake?

01:18:58.650 --> 01:19:01.152
A snake, am I?

01:19:01.236 --> 01:19:06.157
Perhaps you'd like to see
how snakelike I can be.

01:19:23.133 --> 01:19:25.384
Rick 'em, rack 'em, rock 'em, rake
Stick that sword into that snake

01:19:25.469 --> 01:19:27.094
You stay out of this.

01:19:27.179 --> 01:19:30.431
Jafar, Jafar, he's our man.
If he can't do it. . . Great!

01:19:34.728 --> 01:19:36.353
Aladdin.

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:48.407
Jasmine, hang on.

01:19:51.161 --> 01:19:53.454
You little fool.

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:59.752
You thought you could defeat
the most powerful being on Earth.

01:19:59.836 --> 01:20:03.255
Squeeze him, Jafar.
Squeeze him like a. . .

01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:07.468
Without the genie, boy, you're nothing.

01:20:07.552 --> 01:20:10.262
The genie. The genie.

01:20:11.181 --> 01:20:13.265
The genie has more power
than you'll ever have.

01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:14.350
What?

01:20:14.434 --> 01:20:17.186
He gave you your power.
He can take it away.

01:20:17.395 --> 01:20:19.980
Al, what are you doing?
Why are you bringing me into this?

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:23.776
Face it, Jafar.
You're still just second best.

01:20:25.070 --> 01:20:26.320
You're right.

01:20:26.404 --> 01:20:29.490
His power does exceed my own.

01:20:29.991 --> 01:20:32.368
But not for long.

01:20:32.452 --> 01:20:35.538
The boy is crazy.
He's a little punch-drunk.

01:20:35.622 --> 01:20:37.122
One too many hits with the snake.

01:20:37.374 --> 01:20:40.084
Slave, I make my third wish.

01:20:40.293 --> 01:20:44.463
I wish to be an all-powerful genie!

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:51.846
All right, your wish is my command.
Way to go, Al.

01:20:57.394 --> 01:20:59.353
Yes.

01:21:00.772 --> 01:21:02.523
Yes!

01:21:02.607 --> 01:21:04.275
The power.

01:21:06.903 --> 01:21:11.866
The absolute power!

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:14.285
-What have you done?
-Trust me.

01:21:15.412 --> 01:21:20.457
The universe is mine to command,
to control !

01:21:20.542 --> 01:21:23.961
Not so fast, Jafar.
Aren't you forgetting something?

01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:27.381
You wanted to be a genie, you got it.

01:21:27.465 --> 01:21:28.674
What?

01:21:28.758 --> 01:21:30.885
And everything that goes with it.

01:21:31.469 --> 01:21:34.722
-No! No!
-I'm gettin' out of here.

01:21:34.806 --> 01:21:36.724
Phenomenal cosmic powers. . .

01:21:36.808 --> 01:21:39.768
You're the genie. I don't want. . .

01:21:39.853 --> 01:21:41.270
Itty bitty living space.

01:21:41.646 --> 01:21:44.565
Al, you little genius, you.

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:01.749
Get your blasted beak out of my face.

01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:05.419
-Shut up, you moron.
-Don't tell me to shut up.

01:22:05.503 --> 01:22:06.670
Allow me.

01:22:06.755 --> 01:22:10.758
Ten thousand years in a
Cave of Wonders ought to chill him out.

01:22:12.886 --> 01:22:15.054
Shut up!

01:22:20.977 --> 01:22:22.519
Jasmine. . .

01:22:23.480 --> 01:22:25.940
I'm sorry I lied to you
about being a prince.

01:22:26.441 --> 01:22:27.816
I know why you did.

01:22:29.653 --> 01:22:34.490
Well, I guess this is good-bye?

01:22:34.574 --> 01:22:37.534
That stupid law. This isn't fair.

01:22:38.328 --> 01:22:39.828
I love you.

01:22:41.748 --> 01:22:44.959
Al, no problem.
You've still got one wish left.

01:22:45.043 --> 01:22:47.086
Just say the word
and you're a prince again.

01:22:47.212 --> 01:22:49.213
But, Genie, what about your freedom?

01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:52.383
Hey, it's only an eternity of servitude.

01:22:52.592 --> 01:22:54.510
This is love.

01:22:54.594 --> 01:22:58.889
Al, you're not gonna find another girl
like her in a million years.

01:22:59.057 --> 01:23:01.225
Believe me, I know. I've looked.

01:23:02.602 --> 01:23:04.645
Jasmine, I do love you,

01:23:04.729 --> 01:23:08.065
but I got to stop pretending
to be something I'm not.

01:23:08.608 --> 01:23:10.359
I understand.

01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:14.989
Genie, I wish for your freedom.

01:23:15.073 --> 01:23:17.825
One bona fide
prince pedigree coming up.

01:23:17.909 --> 01:23:21.078
-What?
-Genie, you're free.

01:23:42.058 --> 01:23:44.727
I'm free. I'm free.

01:23:44.811 --> 01:23:47.104
Quick. Quick.
Wish for something outrageous.

01:23:47.188 --> 01:23:49.481
Say, "I want the Nile."
Wish for the Nile. Try that.

01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:52.317
-I wish for the Nile.
-No way!

01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:55.612
Does that feel good !

01:23:56.614 --> 01:23:59.992
I'm free! I'm free at last!

01:24:00.076 --> 01:24:03.287
I'm hittin' the road.
I'm off to see the world.

01:24:11.796 --> 01:24:13.797
Genie, I'm. . .

01:24:13.882 --> 01:24:16.383
I'm gonna miss you.

01:24:16.468 --> 01:24:17.968
Me, too, Al.

01:24:20.138 --> 01:24:22.139
No matter what anybody says,

01:24:23.099 --> 01:24:25.684
you'll always be a prince to me.

01:24:26.978 --> 01:24:28.020
That's right.

01:24:28.104 --> 01:24:31.273
You've certainly proven your worth
as far as I'm concerned.

01:24:32.275 --> 01:24:34.860
It's that law that's the problem.

01:24:34.944 --> 01:24:38.113
-Father?
-Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?

01:24:38.198 --> 01:24:39.823
From this day forth,

01:24:39.908 --> 01:24:44.495
the princess shall marry
whomever she deems worthy.

01:24:44.871 --> 01:24:47.331
Him. I choose. . .

01:24:48.458 --> 01:24:51.168
I choose you, Aladdin.

01:24:52.837 --> 01:24:54.713
Call me Al.

01:24:56.549 --> 01:24:59.176
All of you, come over here.
Big group hug.

01:24:59.260 --> 01:25:00.969
Group hug.

01:25:01.054 --> 01:25:02.638
Mind if I kiss the monkey?

01:25:03.389 --> 01:25:04.598
Hairball.

01:25:04.682 --> 01:25:07.226
Well, I can't do any more damage
around this popsicle stand.

01:25:07.310 --> 01:25:09.770
I'm outta here!

01:25:09.854 --> 01:25:12.272
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds!

01:25:12.357 --> 01:25:15.025
Hey, Rugman, ciao. I'm history.

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:16.735
No, I'm mythology.

01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:19.738
I don't care what I am. I'm free!

01:25:22.867 --> 01:25:25.410
A whole new world

01:25:25.495 --> 01:25:28.205
A whole new life

01:25:28.289 --> 01:25:34.128
For you and me

01:25:34.212 --> 01:25:37.881
A whole new world

01:25:50.728 --> 01:25:52.771
Made you look.

01:30:26.295 --> 01:30:28.630
You have been a fabulous audience.

01:30:28.714 --> 01:30:30.882
Tell you what, you're
the best audience in the whole world.

01:30:30.967 --> 01:30:33.593
Take care of yourselves.
Good night, Alice!

01:30:33.678 --> 01:30:37.514
Good night, Agrabah! AdiÃ³s, amigos!
