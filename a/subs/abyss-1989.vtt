00:10.417 --> 00:13.250
(pinging)

00:21.375 --> 00:24.250
(women vocalizing)

00:42.750 --> 00:45.583
(instrumental music playing)

00:50.792 --> 00:52.083
(music ends)

01:12.750 --> 01:15.375
MAN: 60 knots?
No way, Barnes.

01:15.458 --> 01:17.417
The Reds don't have
anything that fast.

01:17.500 --> 01:18.375
Checked it twice.

01:18.458 --> 01:20.875
I mean, it's a real
unique signature.

01:20.959 --> 01:24.375
No cavitation,
no reactor noise.

01:24.458 --> 01:26.333
It doesn't even
sound like screws.

01:27.375 --> 01:29.500
(machine humming)

01:35.333 --> 01:36.667
What the hell is it?

01:38.291 --> 01:39.834
I'll tell you what it's not.

01:41.166 --> 01:42.750
It's not one of ours.

01:42.834 --> 01:46.792
Sir, contact changing
to heading 214.

01:46.875 --> 01:47.875
Speed...

01:49.375 --> 01:50.834
80 knots.

01:52.333 --> 01:53.542
80 knots.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.625
MAN: Still diving.
Depth, 900...

01:56.709 --> 01:59.417
Still diving.
Depth, 900 feet.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.709
Port clearance, 150 feet
from the cliff wall, sir.

02:02.792 --> 02:04.417
It's getting tight in here.

02:04.500 --> 02:07.834
Yeah? We can still
give them a haircut.

02:07.917 --> 02:11.750
Helm, come right to 069er,

02:11.834 --> 02:13.125
down five degrees.

02:13.208 --> 02:15.792
Coming right 069er,
down five degrees, aye.

02:15.875 --> 02:17.500
Portside clearance,
120 feet.

02:17.583 --> 02:18.959
Narrowing to 75.

02:19.041 --> 02:20.959
Sir, we have
a proximity warning light.

02:21.041 --> 02:23.625
It's too damn close.
We've got to back off.

02:23.709 --> 02:25.959
BARNES:
Sir, range to contact, 200.

02:26.041 --> 02:28.458
Contact just jigged
to bearing 260

02:28.542 --> 02:29.875
and accelerated to...

02:31.875 --> 02:33.834
to 130 knots, sir.

02:34.542 --> 02:35.667
Nothing goes 130.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.709
Sir, range to contact,
100 yards.

02:40.375 --> 02:41.792
80 yards, sir!

02:41.875 --> 02:43.041
60!

02:55.583 --> 02:57.500
It's turbulence.
We're in its wake.

02:57.583 --> 02:59.959
Helm, all stop.
Full right rudder.

03:00.041 --> 03:03.208
Hydraulics failure.
Planes not responding, sir.

03:03.291 --> 03:05.166
MAN: Auxiliary power.
Monitors back.

03:05.250 --> 03:06.291
(beeping)

03:06.375 --> 03:08.250
Hydraulics restored, sir.

03:12.083 --> 03:13.083
Oh, my God.

03:16.709 --> 03:18.125
MAN: Fire in sonar!

03:19.250 --> 03:20.834
Collision alarm!

03:20.917 --> 03:22.250
Collision alarm!

03:23.583 --> 03:25.583
-(alarm blaring)
-Fire control to sonar!

03:30.583 --> 03:32.250
Let's get out of here!

03:32.333 --> 03:33.834
Lighten her up, Charlie!

03:33.917 --> 03:36.542
Torpedo room
is flooded, sir!

03:36.625 --> 03:38.041
Blow all tanks!

03:38.125 --> 03:39.792
Blow all the tanks!
Blow everything!

03:44.667 --> 03:46.208
All back full!

03:46.291 --> 03:48.041
Answering. All back full.

03:48.125 --> 03:50.417
Give me a damage report.
What's our depth?

03:53.417 --> 03:55.375
Passing 1,400, sir.

03:55.458 --> 03:57.875
Main's forward tanks
are ruptured!

03:57.959 --> 03:59.333
Still descending, sir.

04:00.500 --> 04:01.959
1,450.

04:05.458 --> 04:07.333
Passing 1,500, sir.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.208
Still descending.

04:10.291 --> 04:12.458
We're too deep
to pump auxiliaries.

04:12.542 --> 04:14.583
Passing 1,550.
Still descending, sir.

04:14.667 --> 04:15.500
We're losin' her.

04:15.583 --> 04:19.375
Passing 1,600, sir,
and still descending.

04:19.458 --> 04:22.083
-Launch the buoy.
-Passing 1,650.

04:22.166 --> 04:24.083
-Passing 1,700, sir.
-Launching!

04:24.166 --> 04:25.166
(beeps)

04:33.834 --> 04:35.125
(electricity crackling)

04:35.208 --> 04:37.375
(alarm blaring)

04:40.500 --> 04:41.875
Come on! Give me your hand!

04:46.834 --> 04:50.000
(screaming)

05:08.083 --> 05:10.375
(beeping)

05:21.083 --> 05:23.667
MAN (over radio):
Benthic Explorer.
Salvor 1 on final. Over.

05:23.750 --> 05:27.542
Copy you, Salvor 1.
This is Benthic Explorer.
You're cleared to land.

05:29.417 --> 05:30.417
-Hey.
-Yeah?

05:30.500 --> 05:31.417
They're coming.

05:39.375 --> 05:42.667
This, uh, could get pretty ugly.

05:42.750 --> 05:44.959
Yeah. It does not
look good at all.

06:20.834 --> 06:23.291
Oh, no. Look who's with 'em.

06:24.125 --> 06:26.375
Queen bitch of the universe.

06:26.458 --> 06:28.166
MAN: Sonny, how you doing?

06:28.250 --> 06:30.583
SONNY: I got two more welds
on this bypass valve.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.166
MAN: No light from the surface.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.375
How deep are they?

06:35.458 --> 06:36.542
McBride?

06:36.625 --> 06:38.208
1,700 feet.

06:38.291 --> 06:40.166
I need them
to go below 2,000.

06:40.250 --> 06:41.834
No problem.
They can do that.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.417
So that's it?

06:45.333 --> 06:46.208
You just cheerfully turn

06:46.291 --> 06:48.667
the whole thing over
to the goon squad?

06:48.750 --> 06:50.333
Look, I was told to cooperate.

06:50.417 --> 06:51.583
I'm cooperating.

06:53.291 --> 06:54.625
Kirkhill, you're pathetic.

06:55.959 --> 06:57.291
Get Brigman on the line.

06:58.375 --> 06:59.375
Hippy, get me Bud.

07:07.291 --> 07:08.709
-MAN: Catfish.
-Yeah.

07:08.792 --> 07:11.458
Get them old buns up here
and give me a hand.

07:11.542 --> 07:13.500
CATFISH: Hang on.
I'll be up there in a second.

07:19.834 --> 07:21.417
Hey, you guys are
milking that job.

07:21.500 --> 07:23.917
Yeah. It's because
we love freezing our butts off

07:24.000 --> 07:25.500
out here for you so much.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.417
MAN: Bring me another hammer!

07:28.500 --> 07:30.208
(hammering)

07:33.709 --> 07:35.709
-Hey, Bud!
-Yeah.

07:35.792 --> 07:38.375
Hippy's on the bitch box!

07:38.458 --> 07:40.959
It's a call from topside.
That new company man.

07:41.041 --> 07:42.333
-Kirkhill?
-Yeah.

07:42.417 --> 07:45.291
That guy don't know
his butt from a rat hole.

07:45.375 --> 07:47.291
Hey, Harry, do me a favor,
will you?

07:47.375 --> 07:48.417
Square away this mud hose.

07:48.500 --> 07:50.125
Get rid of some of
these empty sacks.

07:50.208 --> 07:51.959
This place is starting to
look like my apartment.

07:52.041 --> 07:53.417
HARRY: You got it, boss.

07:56.375 --> 07:58.792
MAN: Bud, pick up
the topside line. It's urgent.

07:58.875 --> 08:00.834
I'm comin'. I'm comin'.

08:00.917 --> 08:02.917
Jesus, keep your pantyhose on.

08:04.375 --> 08:05.834
(buzzing)

08:10.041 --> 08:12.125
Brigman here.

08:12.208 --> 08:13.875
Yeah, Kirkhill,
what's going on?

08:14.875 --> 08:17.125
At 0922 local time today,

08:17.208 --> 08:18.959
an American nuclear submarine,

08:19.041 --> 08:21.959
the USS Montana
with 156 men aboard,

08:22.041 --> 08:24.333
went down
about 22 miles from here.

08:24.417 --> 08:25.500
Damn.

08:25.583 --> 08:27.333
There's been no contact
with the sub since then.

08:27.417 --> 08:29.834
The cause of the incident
is not known.

08:29.917 --> 08:32.457
Your company's authorized
the navy's use of this facility

08:32.542 --> 08:37.291
for a rescue operation,
code-named "Operation Salvo."

08:37.375 --> 08:39.332
You want us to
search for the sub?

08:39.417 --> 08:41.457
No. We know where it is,

08:41.542 --> 08:43.125
but she's in
2,000 feet of water,

08:43.207 --> 08:44.207
and we can't reach her.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.041
We need divers
to enter the sub

08:46.125 --> 08:48.500
and search for survivors,
if any.

08:48.583 --> 08:50.625
Don't you guys
have your own stuff
for this kind of thing?

08:50.709 --> 08:52.709
By the time we get
our rescue submersibles here,

08:52.792 --> 08:54.375
the storm front
will be right on us.

08:54.458 --> 08:56.166
You can get your rig in
under the storm

08:56.250 --> 08:57.458
and be on site in 15 hours.

08:57.542 --> 08:59.667
That makes you
our best option right now.

08:59.750 --> 09:02.000
Why should we risk our butts
for something like this?

09:02.083 --> 09:05.583
I have been authorized to
offer you all special bonuses

09:05.667 --> 09:08.333
equivalent to three times
normal dive pay.

09:08.417 --> 09:09.250
Yes, sir, buddy!

09:09.333 --> 09:12.417
Hell, for triple time,
I'd eat Beanie.

09:12.500 --> 09:15.500
They could set me on fire
and put me out
with horse piddle.

09:15.583 --> 09:16.709
Look, I don't know
what kind of deal

09:16.792 --> 09:17.875
you guys made
with the company,

09:17.959 --> 09:20.000
but my people
are not qualified for this.

09:20.083 --> 09:20.875
We're oil workers.

09:20.959 --> 09:22.333
-This is a paycheck, man.
-(clamoring)

09:22.417 --> 09:24.291
Just shut up! Hold it down.

09:25.417 --> 09:27.709
This is Lieutenant Coffey.

09:27.792 --> 09:29.667
He will transfer down to you
with a SEAL team

09:29.750 --> 09:31.000
and supervise the operation.

09:31.083 --> 09:32.750
You can send down
whoever you like, Commodore,

09:32.834 --> 09:34.208
but I'm the tool-pusher
on this rig,

09:34.291 --> 09:36.667
and when it comes to
the safety of these people,

09:36.750 --> 09:39.250
there's me and then
there's God, understand?

09:39.333 --> 09:41.834
If things get dicey,
I'm pulling the plug.

09:44.542 --> 09:48.208
I think we're all on
the same wavelength, Brigman.

09:48.291 --> 09:51.166
Now let's get the wellhead
uncoupled, shall we?

09:53.208 --> 09:54.500
All right.
Let's get ready to move.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.458
Let's take it about
five degrees left, all right?

10:26.250 --> 10:28.375
Roger. Five degrees left, Bud.

10:36.375 --> 10:37.834
Plot these numbers
to our position.

10:37.917 --> 10:39.417
I need to know when the...

10:39.500 --> 10:40.458
Yes, sir.

10:40.542 --> 10:42.458
Well, it's official,
sports fans.

10:42.542 --> 10:44.792
They're calling it
Hurricane Frederick,

10:44.875 --> 10:46.917
and it's going to be
making our lives

10:47.000 --> 10:48.792
real interesting
in a few hours.

10:48.875 --> 10:51.291
Fred, huh?
I don't know, man.

10:51.375 --> 10:54.166
I think hurricanes should be
named after women, don't you?

10:57.333 --> 10:58.542
(panting)

11:02.083 --> 11:04.250
I can't believe
you're letting them do this.

11:04.333 --> 11:05.959
Hi, Linds.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.542
I thought you were in Houston.

11:08.583 --> 11:11.000
I was. Now I'm here.

11:11.083 --> 11:13.542
Only here isn't
where I left it, is it, Bud?

11:13.625 --> 11:14.542
It wasn't up to me.

11:14.625 --> 11:16.500
Jesus, we were
that close to proving

11:16.583 --> 11:18.542
a submersible drilling
platform could work.

11:18.625 --> 11:21.000
I can't believe you let them
grab my rig!

11:21.083 --> 11:22.333
-Your rig?
-My rig.

11:22.417 --> 11:23.667
I designed the damn thing.

11:23.750 --> 11:25.333
Yeah, and Benthic Petroleum
paid for it.

11:25.417 --> 11:26.792
So as long as they're holding
the pink slip...

11:26.875 --> 11:29.166
(whistles) I go
where they tell me.

11:29.250 --> 11:30.709
I had a lot riding on this,

11:30.792 --> 11:32.291
and they bought you,
didn't they?

11:32.375 --> 11:34.208
More like
rented you cheap!

11:34.291 --> 11:37.709
I'm switching off now.
Bye-bye.

11:37.792 --> 11:39.667
Oh, okay, Virgil, you wiener!

11:39.750 --> 11:41.625
You never could
stand up to a fight.

11:41.709 --> 11:43.083
Bye-bye.

11:43.917 --> 11:45.417
Virgil?

11:47.917 --> 11:49.542
God, I hate that bitch.

11:51.291 --> 11:53.917
Probably shouldn't have
married her, then, huh?

11:58.667 --> 12:00.166
MAN: Get it stable!

12:04.000 --> 12:04.917
Easy!

12:05.000 --> 12:07.250
MAN: Roger, Cab 3.
You're clear to launch.

12:10.083 --> 12:11.458
Hang on, gentlemen.

12:12.792 --> 12:14.291
MAN: She's clear!

12:16.959 --> 12:19.125
Touchdown. Crowd goes wild.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.917
Explorer, this is Cab 3.
We are styling.

12:25.792 --> 12:27.417
How you boys doing back there?

12:27.500 --> 12:28.625
Great.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.625
LINDSEY: Explorer, this is Cab 3

12:32.709 --> 12:35.291
starting our descent
along the umbilical.

12:35.375 --> 12:37.250
MAN: Roger that, Cab 3.
Good luck.

12:37.333 --> 12:38.709
LINDSEY: Luck is not a factor.

12:41.792 --> 12:45.458
♪ And I've been from Tucson
to Tucumcari ♪

12:46.375 --> 12:49.417
♪ Tehachapi to Tonopah ♪

12:49.500 --> 12:55.750
♪ Driven every kind of rig

12:55.834 --> 12:59.917
♪ Driven the back roads
so I wouldn't get weighed ♪

13:00.000 --> 13:03.417
LINDSEY: Deep Core, Deep Core,
this is Cab 3 on final approach.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.834
Roger, Cab 3.
Is that you, Lindsey?

13:07.542 --> 13:08.875
None other.

13:11.208 --> 13:12.709
Oh, no.

13:19.542 --> 13:21.417
(clanging)

13:22.667 --> 13:23.917
(creaking)

13:34.208 --> 13:35.583
Howdy, boys.

13:35.667 --> 13:38.917
Hey, Lindsey.
I'll be damned!

13:39.000 --> 13:40.500
Y'all shouldn't be down here,
sweet thing.

13:40.583 --> 13:42.208
Might run your stockings.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.375
(chuckles)

13:48.083 --> 13:52.250
The bad news is,
we got eight hours
in this can blowing down,

13:52.333 --> 13:57.208
and the worse news is,
it's gonna take us
three weeks to decompress later.

13:57.291 --> 13:59.208
We've all been fully briefed,
Mrs. Brigman.

13:59.291 --> 14:01.083
Just don't call me that, okay?
I hate that.

14:03.750 --> 14:05.000
All right.

14:05.083 --> 14:06.542
Well, what would you
like us to call you?

14:07.083 --> 14:08.041
Sir?

14:08.125 --> 14:09.250
(scoffs)

14:10.583 --> 14:11.834
(scoffs)

14:11.917 --> 14:13.834
Okay, here we go.

14:13.917 --> 14:16.500
Y'all start equalizing... now.

14:16.583 --> 14:17.709
(hissing)

14:21.250 --> 14:24.500
Let's watch each other
closely for signs of HPNS.

14:24.583 --> 14:25.875
High-pressure
nervous syndrome.

14:25.959 --> 14:27.667
Muscle tremors,
usually in the hands first,

14:27.750 --> 14:29.333
nausea,
increased excitability...

14:29.417 --> 14:30.500
Disorientation.

14:30.583 --> 14:32.750
♪ And a partridge
in a pear tree ♪

14:35.083 --> 14:35.834
(clears throat)

14:35.917 --> 14:38.709
About one person in 20
can't handle it.

14:38.792 --> 14:40.208
They just go buggo.

14:40.291 --> 14:42.375
Look, they've all made
runs to this depth.

14:42.458 --> 14:43.208
They're checked out.

14:43.291 --> 14:44.417
No, I understand that.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.375
What I'm saying is
that it's impossible

14:46.458 --> 14:47.875
to predict
just who's susceptible.

14:47.959 --> 14:49.417
They checked out.

14:52.792 --> 14:54.083
These guys are SEALs?

14:54.166 --> 14:57.250
Yeah. These guys ain't so tough.

14:57.333 --> 14:59.375
I've fought guys
plenty tougher than 'em.

14:59.458 --> 15:01.375
Now do we get to hear
how you could have been
a contender?

15:01.458 --> 15:05.500
Hey! Hey!
You see this?

15:05.583 --> 15:06.709
Yeah.

15:06.792 --> 15:08.500
They used to call
this the hammer.

15:08.583 --> 15:09.667
Aah.

15:18.542 --> 15:20.834
Y'all are done to a turn
and ready to serve.

15:21.625 --> 15:22.875
Everybody okay?

15:27.875 --> 15:30.125
They're really very sweet.

15:30.208 --> 15:33.083
Hey! I don't remember
putting a wall here.

15:33.166 --> 15:34.000
How you doing, Jammer?

15:34.083 --> 15:35.250
Pretty good.
How are you, little lady?

15:35.333 --> 15:36.333
I'm okay.

15:44.625 --> 15:45.792
I want a full check
on their gear.

15:45.875 --> 15:48.583
Yes, sir.
These guys are about as much fun
as a tax audit.

15:48.667 --> 15:49.709
You got that right.

16:06.500 --> 16:09.083
Hippy, you're gonna
give that rat a disease.

16:09.166 --> 16:10.417
HIPPY: Hi, Linds.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.458
Well, well. Mrs. Brigman.

16:16.542 --> 16:18.041
Not for long.

16:21.375 --> 16:25.083
You never did like
being called that, did you?

16:25.166 --> 16:27.250
Not even when
it meant something.

16:29.667 --> 16:30.917
Is that One Night in flatbed?

16:31.000 --> 16:32.834
Yeah. Who else? Here. Say hi.

16:34.834 --> 16:36.500
Hey, One Night, it's Lindsey.

16:36.583 --> 16:38.417
Oh, hi, Lindsey.

16:43.583 --> 16:46.000
So what are you doing
down here, hot rod?

16:46.083 --> 16:47.500
You need me.

16:47.583 --> 16:50.125
Nobody knows the systems
on this rig better than I do.

16:50.208 --> 16:51.792
Once you're disconnected
from the Explorer,

16:51.875 --> 16:54.792
you guys are on your own for
however long this storm lasts.

16:54.875 --> 16:56.125
What if something
was to happen

16:56.208 --> 16:57.500
after the surface
support clears off?

16:57.583 --> 16:58.667
What would you have done?

16:58.750 --> 17:01.000
Wow. You're right.
Us poor, dumb old boys

17:01.083 --> 17:02.542
might have had to
think for ourselves.

17:02.625 --> 17:04.083
It could have been a disaster.

17:06.583 --> 17:07.666
You wanna know what I think?

17:07.750 --> 17:10.125
Jesus, look where
this thing is set.

17:10.208 --> 17:11.834
You want to know what I think?

17:11.916 --> 17:13.458
Not particularly.

17:13.541 --> 17:15.500
I think you were
worried about me.

17:15.583 --> 17:16.500
Then that must be it.

17:16.583 --> 17:18.290
No, seriously. I think you were.

17:18.375 --> 17:22.666
Come on. It's okay. It's okay.
You can admit it.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.375
I was worried about the rig.

17:25.458 --> 17:27.541
I've got over four years
invested in this project.

17:27.625 --> 17:29.792
Yeah. You only had three years
invested in me.

17:32.458 --> 17:34.417
Well, you have to
have priorities.

18:15.709 --> 18:17.500
Oh, shit.

18:20.041 --> 18:21.583
ONE NIGHT:
Cuttin' you loose, Bud.

18:21.667 --> 18:25.041
BUD:
Okay, One Night, stay clear.
We're setting her down.

18:31.834 --> 18:33.333
Touchdown.

18:33.959 --> 18:35.083
This is us.

18:35.166 --> 18:37.125
We're sitting right on the edge
of the Cayman Trough.

18:38.125 --> 18:39.709
This is the Montana,

18:39.792 --> 18:42.959
300 meters away,
70 meters below us.

18:44.000 --> 18:45.625
We think she slid down the wall

18:45.709 --> 18:48.333
and now sits here
on this outcropping.

18:48.417 --> 18:52.458
So we're gonna have to
drop straight down here.

18:52.542 --> 18:54.625
This tell us how much
radiation we're getting?

18:54.709 --> 18:57.750
Whoa, whoa! I'm not
going near no radiation.

18:57.834 --> 18:59.750
-No way.
-Ah, Hippy, you pussy.

18:59.834 --> 19:00.625
Yeah? What good is the money?

19:00.709 --> 19:02.792
Six months later,
your dick drops off.

19:02.875 --> 19:03.917
(laughing)

19:04.000 --> 19:06.125
What is your problem, huh?

19:06.208 --> 19:08.291
On this dive,
you'll do absolutely nothing

19:08.375 --> 19:09.792
without direct orders
from me,

19:09.875 --> 19:12.083
and you'll follow those orders
without discussion.

19:12.166 --> 19:13.542
Is that clear?

19:15.709 --> 19:17.250
All right. I want everyone
finished prep

19:17.333 --> 19:19.250
and ready to get wet
in 15 minutes.

19:21.375 --> 19:23.041
All right. Let's throw it
in the water.

19:24.500 --> 19:25.875
Keep it coming.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.959
Hippy, throw me one of
'em cyalumes, please.

19:30.041 --> 19:32.458
-Yeah, sure.
-Good. Good.

19:32.542 --> 19:34.166
Excuse me.

19:34.250 --> 19:35.667
What is all this stuff?

19:35.750 --> 19:38.667
Fluid-breathing system.
We just got them.

19:38.750 --> 19:40.375
You use it
when you go really deep.

19:40.458 --> 19:42.166
How deep?

19:42.250 --> 19:44.208
-Deep.
-How deep?

19:45.041 --> 19:46.834
It's classified.

19:46.917 --> 19:48.875
Anyway, you breathe liquid
so you can't get compressed.

19:48.959 --> 19:50.041
The pressure doesn't get you.

19:50.125 --> 19:52.375
You mean you got liquid
in your lungs?

19:53.375 --> 19:55.709
Oxygenated
fluorocarbon emulsion.

19:55.792 --> 19:57.250
Bullshit.

19:59.208 --> 20:00.250
Check this out.

20:02.208 --> 20:04.667
-Can I borrow your rat?
-What-what are you doing?

20:04.750 --> 20:07.333
-Hey, hey. Nah, nah, nah.
-You're gonna kill her!

20:07.417 --> 20:08.667
It's okay,
I've done this myself.

20:08.750 --> 20:11.041
Oh, man!
What, are you just drowning her?

20:11.125 --> 20:13.208
He's gonna be fine.

20:13.291 --> 20:15.542
I've breathed this myself.
It's gonna be fine.

20:15.625 --> 20:16.709
No, man. She's gonna drown!

20:16.792 --> 20:18.166
Look. She's freaking out!

20:18.250 --> 20:19.709
Just going through
a normal adjustment period.

20:19.792 --> 20:22.542
Normal? Does this
look normal to you?
She's gonna drown.

20:22.625 --> 20:24.625
He's taking the fluid
into his lungs.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.458
He's taking the fluid
into his lungs.

20:31.166 --> 20:33.041
There he goes.

20:33.125 --> 20:35.834
Still has a bit of anxiety here.

20:35.917 --> 20:37.500
Now he's starting to relax.

20:37.583 --> 20:40.041
He's breathing fine.
See his chest moving?

20:40.125 --> 20:41.250
He's getting
plenty of oxygen.

20:41.333 --> 20:43.750
Ha. Damn rat's
breathing that shit.

20:44.625 --> 20:47.083
That is no bullshit,
hands down,

20:47.166 --> 20:49.250
the goddamnedest thing
I ever saw.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.250
See, the fluid's harder
to push in and out than air.

20:51.333 --> 20:53.875
It's a little more work
to breathe.

20:53.959 --> 20:57.083
He's doing fine.
He's diggin' it.

20:57.166 --> 20:58.792
She's doin' it.
She ain't diggin' it.

20:58.875 --> 21:00.583
All right.
Let her out now. Now!

21:00.667 --> 21:02.959
Okay. All right.

21:03.041 --> 21:05.959
Okay, now we let the fluid
drain from his lungs.

21:07.333 --> 21:08.583
-There we go.
-All right. Give her here.

21:08.667 --> 21:10.834
-Give her.
-Here's your rat.

21:12.291 --> 21:13.625
See? He's fine.

21:13.709 --> 21:14.834
It's a she.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.542
Going over the wall.

21:18.625 --> 21:20.458
Coming to bearing 065.

21:22.333 --> 21:24.083
Flatbed, you online?

21:24.166 --> 21:26.166
ONE NIGHT: 10-4, Lindsey.
We read you loud and clear.

21:28.667 --> 21:31.792
Starting our descent.
Divers, how you doin'?

21:31.875 --> 21:34.291
MAN: Everybody's okay so far.

21:34.375 --> 21:36.834
ONE NIGHT: Hang on, boys.
It's all downhill from here.

21:38.208 --> 21:40.291
Hey, how deep's
the drop-off here?

21:40.375 --> 21:42.625
This here's
a bottomless pit, baby.

21:42.709 --> 21:45.667
Two and a half miles
straight down.

21:49.917 --> 21:52.250
Cab 3, it's Bud. You online?

21:52.333 --> 21:54.667
Cab 3, check.
I'm right behind you.

21:59.709 --> 22:01.208
Cab 1, do you see it yet?

22:02.750 --> 22:06.083
Magnetometer's twitching,
but I don't see anything yet.

22:06.166 --> 22:08.208
Hang on.
I wanna test my strobes.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.750
COFFEY: Cab 1,
do you have a visual?

22:19.250 --> 22:20.500
Cab 1, do you copy?

22:20.583 --> 22:23.875
Uh, yeah. Roger that. Found it.

22:40.250 --> 22:42.333
COFFEY: Cab 1,
radiation readings.

22:42.417 --> 22:44.291
Neutron counter's
not showing much.

22:44.375 --> 22:47.375
All right. Just continue
forward and along the hull.

22:48.250 --> 22:49.959
Copy that. Continuing forward.

22:51.542 --> 22:53.208
You want me to get shots
of everything, yes?

22:53.291 --> 22:54.375
COFFEY: Roger that.

22:54.458 --> 22:56.875
Document as much as you can,
but please keep moving.

22:57.000 --> 22:59.041
Remember, we're on
a tight timeline.

22:59.125 --> 23:00.458
LINDSEY: Copy that.

23:04.250 --> 23:06.083
COFFEY: Coming up
to the midship's hatch.

23:06.834 --> 23:07.875
Do you see it, Cab 3?

23:07.959 --> 23:09.291
Yeah. Roger. I got it.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.667
How do you want me?

23:15.750 --> 23:18.208
-Just hold above it.
-Roger. Holding.

23:18.291 --> 23:19.875
Okay, it's all yours,
Lieutenant.

23:19.959 --> 23:21.166
All right, A-team.

23:21.250 --> 23:22.291
Let's do it.

23:38.166 --> 23:41.583
Okay, Perry, Hippy,
let's get that ROV launched.

23:41.667 --> 23:43.458
Okay, we're on it, boss.

23:44.166 --> 23:45.250
Go.

23:45.333 --> 23:47.667
(whirring)

23:49.542 --> 23:51.667
HIPPY: Little Geek
is on the case.

24:01.542 --> 24:03.458
Monk here, sir.

24:03.542 --> 24:05.917
We got the midship's
outer hatch open.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.458
We're goin' in.

24:13.458 --> 24:15.750
LINDSEY: Coffey, these are
the missile hatches, right?

24:15.834 --> 24:16.875
COFFEY: That's right.

24:16.959 --> 24:19.375
Looks like a couple
of the hatches have sprung.

24:20.250 --> 24:21.667
Radiation's nominal.

24:21.750 --> 24:23.792
Warheads must still be intact.

24:23.875 --> 24:25.291
How many are there?

24:25.375 --> 24:28.375
24 trident missiles.
Eight MIRVs per missile.

24:29.750 --> 24:31.709
That's 192 warheads, Coffey.

24:32.875 --> 24:34.583
How powerful are they?

24:34.667 --> 24:36.792
Your MIRV is a tactical nuke.

24:36.875 --> 24:41.208
Uh, 50 kilotons nominal yield,
say, five times Hiroshima.

24:57.375 --> 24:58.917
Just set it down here.

24:59.000 --> 25:00.500
ONE NIGHT: Copy that.

25:00.583 --> 25:02.834
There's a breach
in the pressure hold.

25:02.917 --> 25:04.375
That's where we go in.

25:06.750 --> 25:08.750
-ONE NIGHT: We're solid.
-Let's go.

25:10.208 --> 25:11.750
All right. Let's go.

25:21.709 --> 25:24.959
Okay, let's just take it
slow and easy going in.

25:25.959 --> 25:27.542
Don't take any chances.

25:54.667 --> 25:56.709
MAN: Where are we, Coffey?

25:56.792 --> 25:58.875
This is the forward
berthing compartment.

25:58.959 --> 26:00.250
This way.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.458
Come on. Let's keep up.

26:16.083 --> 26:17.959
All right. Up this way
to the control center.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.875
(thudding)

26:43.375 --> 26:44.834
(grunting)

26:46.333 --> 26:48.250
It's jammed.
Give me a hand.

26:48.333 --> 26:50.000
Get up here
with that pry bar.

26:52.208 --> 26:53.834
It's moving. Pull!

27:03.625 --> 27:04.709
Jesus.

27:04.792 --> 27:05.709
Oh, God.

27:05.792 --> 27:08.125
All right. We knew
we were gonna see this.

27:08.208 --> 27:09.375
Just move on.

27:13.083 --> 27:15.083
-Jesus.
-Come on, Jammer. Let's go.

27:51.083 --> 27:53.250
Okay. Let's stay cool.

27:54.583 --> 27:57.375
Everybody stay cool.

27:57.458 --> 28:01.417
We can't help these guys,
but we might find
somebody further in.

28:04.959 --> 28:06.542
(breathes sharply)

28:07.250 --> 28:08.959
Hey, Jammer. You okay?

28:09.917 --> 28:11.542
Mm-hmm.

28:11.625 --> 28:12.875
How you guys doing?

28:12.959 --> 28:13.875
I'm dealing.

28:13.959 --> 28:16.542
Triple time sounded like
a lot of money, Bud.

28:16.625 --> 28:17.458
It ain't.

28:17.542 --> 28:19.834
We're here.
Let's get it done, okay?

28:19.917 --> 28:23.500
Brigman, take your men
and continue aft.

28:23.583 --> 28:26.208
Split up into two teams.

28:26.291 --> 28:29.959
Come on. Let's get moving.
We head back in 14 minutes.

28:30.041 --> 28:31.291
Let's go.

28:45.959 --> 28:48.542
-You still with me, Jammer?
-Where are we?

28:48.625 --> 28:50.166
Missile compartment.

28:51.333 --> 28:53.000
Those are the launch tubes.

29:00.000 --> 29:01.041
Shit!

29:01.125 --> 29:02.834
Shit, shit, shit!

29:04.959 --> 29:06.333
Hey, Jammer.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.083
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!

29:10.166 --> 29:11.458
You okay?

29:12.500 --> 29:14.250
Deep and slow, big guy.

29:14.333 --> 29:16.125
Deep and slow.
Just breathe easy.

29:16.208 --> 29:18.417
Everybody's dead!
They're all dead.

29:18.500 --> 29:21.041
Okay. I'm taking
you back out. Let's go.

29:21.125 --> 29:23.375
No. I'm okay. I'm okay.

29:28.125 --> 29:30.417
I just can't go any further in.

29:30.500 --> 29:32.917
Okay, Jammer. No problem.
You stay right here.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.709
I've got to check out
this compartment, all right?

29:35.792 --> 29:38.083
We'll stay in voice contact.

29:38.166 --> 29:39.792
You hold onto the end
of this rope here.

29:39.875 --> 29:43.375
You have any problem whatsoever,
you tug twice.

29:43.458 --> 29:46.250
-I got it.
-Pull it hard.
Five more minutes.

29:46.333 --> 29:48.250
Just relax, all right?
You'll be okay.

29:48.333 --> 29:49.834
-Okay.
-Be right back.

29:56.917 --> 29:58.166
(heavy breathing)

29:58.250 --> 29:59.375
(metallic clanging)

30:35.667 --> 30:38.542
BUD: You still reading me okay,
big guy?

30:38.625 --> 30:40.083
Read you fine, Bud.

30:46.041 --> 30:49.667
Okay. Just a few more minutes.

30:49.750 --> 30:52.834
There's a couple compartments
up ahead that might have air.

30:52.917 --> 30:54.041
Okay. No problem.

30:54.125 --> 30:56.041
We got to be sure, right?

30:56.125 --> 30:58.125
Hang on, Jammer.
You just hold on to that...

31:05.750 --> 31:06.917
Shit!

31:08.417 --> 31:09.458
Bud?

31:09.542 --> 31:11.208
Bud, can you hear me?

31:11.291 --> 31:13.583
Bud? Bud?

31:17.166 --> 31:18.875
Goddamn it!

31:18.959 --> 31:21.667
(hyperventilating)

31:30.959 --> 31:32.375
Oh, Jesus!

31:32.458 --> 31:34.750
(hyperventilating)

31:54.417 --> 31:56.834
(breathing slows)

32:02.875 --> 32:04.458
Bud, is that you?

32:27.166 --> 32:28.500
Hang on, Jammer.

32:31.500 --> 32:34.000
Lew, Cat, hurry up!
On the double!

32:35.333 --> 32:36.959
I'm on my way.

32:39.667 --> 32:41.709
(gurgling)

32:43.709 --> 32:45.125
Jammer!

32:45.208 --> 32:46.500
(groaning)

32:48.375 --> 32:50.667
-What's the problem?
-He's convulsing!

32:52.917 --> 32:56.166
It's his mixture.
Too much oxygen.

32:56.250 --> 32:59.000
Got to get the O2 cut down!
Turn him over!

33:00.875 --> 33:03.000
Crank it down, man!
You're losin' him!

33:07.166 --> 33:10.000
All right. We gotta get him
out of here. Let's go.
Let's move it.

33:11.041 --> 33:12.417
Easy, big fella.

33:13.208 --> 33:14.208
That's it.

33:16.000 --> 33:17.667
One Night,
do you see the divers?

33:17.750 --> 33:19.667
-Are they out yet?
-ONE NIGHT: Negative, Lindsey.

33:19.750 --> 33:22.125
Haven't seen hide nor hair.

33:22.208 --> 33:23.875
Let's give 'em
two minutes more max,

33:23.959 --> 33:26.125
and then I'll sound
a diver recall.

33:27.959 --> 33:29.125
(thudding)

33:29.208 --> 33:30.542
(whooshing)

33:47.041 --> 33:49.000
BUD: Lindsey, do you copy?

33:49.083 --> 33:51.834
Meet me at flatbed.
This is a diver emergency.

33:51.917 --> 33:53.458
Linds, do you copy?

33:53.542 --> 33:56.166
Uh, yeah, copy you, Bud.
I'm on my way.

33:56.250 --> 33:57.583
(exhales sharply)

34:02.083 --> 34:03.583
Look, I'm just a medic,

34:05.000 --> 34:07.041
which is mostly about
patching holes.

34:07.125 --> 34:09.375
This type of thing, it's...

34:09.458 --> 34:11.000
There's not much I can do.

34:12.333 --> 34:14.625
A coma could last hours or days.

34:19.958 --> 34:21.542
(beeps)

34:21.625 --> 34:23.625
So you didn't get
anything on the cameras.

34:24.625 --> 34:27.000
No. I didn't get
a picture of it.

34:27.083 --> 34:28.208
What about the video?

34:28.291 --> 34:31.833
No. We lost power right then.

34:31.917 --> 34:34.333
Look, I just don't wanna
talk about this, okay?

34:34.958 --> 34:37.166
Fine. Be that way.

34:37.250 --> 34:39.417
Look, I don't know
what I saw, Bud, okay?

34:39.500 --> 34:42.375
Coffey wants to call it
a Russian submersible, fine,

34:42.458 --> 34:43.708
it's a Russian submersible.

34:43.792 --> 34:45.333
No problem.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.291
Yeah, but you think
it was something else.

34:48.500 --> 34:49.542
What?

34:50.833 --> 34:52.291
One of ours?

34:55.500 --> 34:57.041
No.

34:57.125 --> 34:58.333
Well, whose then?

35:00.542 --> 35:02.166
Come on, Lindsey, talk to me.

35:04.166 --> 35:06.375
Look, Jammer saw
something down there,

35:06.458 --> 35:08.458
something that scared
the hell out of him.

35:08.542 --> 35:10.458
His mixture got screwed up.

35:10.542 --> 35:11.709
Jammer panicked.

35:11.792 --> 35:14.083
He pranged his regulator,
and his mixture got screwed up.

35:14.166 --> 35:16.542
But what did he see
that made him panic?

35:18.667 --> 35:20.333
Well, what do you think he saw?

35:22.458 --> 35:23.709
I don't know.

35:24.834 --> 35:26.417
Did any of you see it?

35:26.500 --> 35:28.875
No, sir.
The Brigman woman saw it.

35:30.041 --> 35:31.291
It could have been
a Russian bogey.

35:31.375 --> 35:32.500
Oh.

35:32.583 --> 35:34.542
CINCLANTFLT's
gonna go apeshit.

35:35.917 --> 35:38.291
Two Russian attack subs,
Etango and Evicto,

35:38.375 --> 35:40.458
were tracked within
50 miles of here.

35:40.542 --> 35:42.500
Now they don't know
where the hell they are.

35:42.583 --> 35:43.709
Okay.

35:45.333 --> 35:47.625
I haven't got any choice.

35:47.709 --> 35:49.917
I'm confirming you
to go to phase two.

35:50.000 --> 35:52.333
You'll recover
one warhead, arm it,

35:52.417 --> 35:54.041
and wait for
further instructions.

35:55.375 --> 35:56.458
We got a problem with that?

35:56.542 --> 35:57.834
Negative, sir.

35:59.875 --> 36:01.250
(whistles) Better come on.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.291
(indistinct chatter)

36:02.375 --> 36:03.291
-Shh!
-Turn it up, folks.

36:03.375 --> 36:04.917
Sources have not
confirmed any reports

36:05.000 --> 36:06.041
that the Montana encountered

36:06.125 --> 36:09.709
a Soviet fast-attack sub
prior to its sinking.

36:09.792 --> 36:13.166
and the Kremlin continues
to deny any involvement.

36:13.250 --> 36:14.917
Oh, that's us.
That's us, man.

36:15.750 --> 36:16.792
MAN: There's the Explorer.

36:16.875 --> 36:18.792
...participating in
the recovery operation.

36:18.875 --> 36:21.542
There is a tremendous
amount of activity.

36:21.625 --> 36:24.000
With Cuba only 80 miles away,

36:24.083 --> 36:26.333
the massive buildup
of American forces

36:26.417 --> 36:30.500
has drawn official protest
from Havana and Moscow.

36:30.583 --> 36:32.333
Russian and Cuban trawlers,

36:32.417 --> 36:34.667
undoubtedly
surveillance vessels,

36:34.750 --> 36:36.709
have been circling the area,

36:36.792 --> 36:39.000
and Soviet aircraft
have repeatedly...

36:39.083 --> 36:40.583
-This sucks.
-...been warned away.

36:41.583 --> 36:43.375
Hippy, what's the matter
with you?

36:43.458 --> 36:45.333
What's the matter
with me? Nothing.

36:45.417 --> 36:48.125
We're just in the middle of some
big-time international incident

36:48.208 --> 36:50.125
like the Cuban missile crisis
or something.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.709
Figured that out for yourself,
did you, Hip?

36:51.792 --> 36:54.166
You know, we got Russian subs
creeping around.

36:54.250 --> 36:56.875
Anything goes wrong down here,
they could say whatever
they want happened,

36:56.959 --> 36:58.208
give the folks medals.

36:58.291 --> 37:00.875
Relax, will ya?
You're making the women nervous.

37:00.959 --> 37:01.875
Cute, Virgil.

37:01.959 --> 37:05.542
You know, those SEALs
ain't telling us diddly.

37:05.625 --> 37:07.375
Something is goin' on!

37:07.458 --> 37:08.667
Come on, come on.

37:08.750 --> 37:10.250
Hippy, you think
everything's a conspiracy.

37:10.792 --> 37:13.041
Everything is.

37:13.125 --> 37:15.375
Hurry up.
Coffey's splitting with flatbed!

37:15.458 --> 37:18.375
I showed him
how to work the controls,
and they're outta here.

37:18.458 --> 37:19.875
Didn't you tell him
we need it right now?

37:19.959 --> 37:21.417
Yeah. He didn't
pay any attention.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.166
-Where the hell is he taking it?
-I have no idea!

37:23.250 --> 37:24.458
Shit!

37:25.625 --> 37:27.875
Coffey! Come back!

37:27.959 --> 37:31.875
We need the big arm
to unhook the umbilical.

37:31.959 --> 37:34.125
There's a goddamn
hurricane coming!

37:34.959 --> 37:35.917
LINDSEY: He switched off.

37:36.000 --> 37:37.291
It's unbelievable.

37:37.375 --> 37:39.250
(wind gushing)

37:39.333 --> 37:40.250
Go back down!

37:40.333 --> 37:44.041
Tell those men to get below
and stay there!

37:53.834 --> 37:54.792
(groans)

37:54.875 --> 37:57.542
We need to get unhooked
and get out of here now.

37:57.625 --> 37:59.250
All right, do it then.

37:59.333 --> 38:02.041
No problem, except your boys
went sightseeing with flatbed.

38:02.125 --> 38:05.041
My people need flatbed
to get unhooked at their end.

38:05.125 --> 38:06.250
Back in two hours.

38:06.333 --> 38:07.250
Two hours?

38:07.333 --> 38:08.875
We're gonna get
the shit kicked out of us

38:08.959 --> 38:10.709
by our pal Fred in two hours.

38:12.333 --> 38:15.375
-Okay, it's clear.
-It's all yours, sir.

38:16.250 --> 38:18.208
Swing it away and drop it.

38:18.542 --> 38:19.667
Check.

38:20.333 --> 38:22.125
Okay.

38:22.208 --> 38:24.875
Bypass the ground connection
on the separation sequencer.

38:26.000 --> 38:26.959
Got it?

38:27.041 --> 38:29.375
Separation sequencer
disconnected.

38:31.083 --> 38:33.125
Remove explosive bolts
one through six

38:33.208 --> 38:34.750
in counterclockwise sequence.

38:34.834 --> 38:36.667
Check. Removing bolt one.

39:00.417 --> 39:02.375
All right.
Let's get their gear off!

39:02.458 --> 39:04.667
Then clear the sub.
We got to get it outta here!

39:04.750 --> 39:06.625
Come on. Let's go.
Let's move it!

39:07.417 --> 39:08.667
One Night, you're up.

39:08.750 --> 39:09.959
Get ready to roll, baby.

39:10.041 --> 39:11.667
Don't touch that.
Just back away.

39:11.750 --> 39:12.709
Excusez-moi!

39:15.458 --> 39:16.875
Hey, Coffey,

39:16.959 --> 39:18.208
we are a little pressed
for time.

39:22.709 --> 39:23.458
Prick.

39:24.917 --> 39:26.667
This ain't no drill, slick.
Make me proud.

39:26.750 --> 39:28.250
Piece of cake, baby.

39:41.250 --> 39:43.834
(wind gusting)

40:04.083 --> 40:05.208
BUD:
What's the problem, One Night?

40:05.291 --> 40:07.166
All hell must be
breaking loose up there.

40:07.250 --> 40:09.125
This cable's
pissing me off.

40:10.625 --> 40:12.250
I can't get
a grip on it.

40:12.333 --> 40:14.458
BUD: Well, keep trying,
baby, just keep trying.

40:16.250 --> 40:17.500
Son of a bitch!

40:18.792 --> 40:20.208
Shit!

40:20.291 --> 40:21.583
We got a problem!

40:21.667 --> 40:22.583
What's going on?

40:22.667 --> 40:24.250
We're losing
number two thruster!

40:24.333 --> 40:25.542
Bearing's going!

40:25.625 --> 40:27.583
MAN: She's not going
to take the pressure!

40:27.667 --> 40:28.750
It's not holding!

40:28.834 --> 40:31.083
We're swinging out
of position here!
Goddamn it!

40:41.166 --> 40:42.542
Ooh! Jesus.

40:49.667 --> 40:51.458
Ah, shit!

41:02.041 --> 41:03.834
The rig is moving!

41:03.917 --> 41:04.792
Yeah,
I can see that.

41:04.875 --> 41:06.291
Topside! Topside!

41:06.375 --> 41:07.792
Pay out some slack.
We're getting dragged.

41:07.875 --> 41:09.250
Down on number one winch!

41:09.333 --> 41:10.959
BUD: We're getting dragged.
Down on one!

41:17.208 --> 41:18.709
Bud, we're headed
right for the drop-off.

41:48.583 --> 41:50.333
MAN: What the hell?

41:50.417 --> 41:52.750
We just lost
all the topside feeds.

41:55.250 --> 41:57.917
Shit! Get him on the UQC!

41:59.375 --> 42:00.208
Bud!

42:01.959 --> 42:04.125
We lost the crane!
Say again. What?

42:04.208 --> 42:07.208
The crane!
We've lost the crane!

42:07.291 --> 42:09.083
It's on its way
down to you!

42:10.625 --> 42:13.333
All right, everybody!
Everybody, brace for impact!

42:13.417 --> 42:15.500
(alarm blaring)
Close all the exterior hatches!

42:15.583 --> 42:17.667
Let's move it! Let's go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

42:17.750 --> 42:20.709
(alarm blaring)

42:20.792 --> 42:22.625
Wait! Wait! Wait!
Get in here!

42:25.667 --> 42:28.041
What the hell is
going on around here?

42:28.125 --> 42:29.125
I don't know.

42:36.792 --> 42:38.208
You two help
secure the rig.

42:38.291 --> 42:39.583
Let's go.

42:48.166 --> 42:49.834
One Night, One Night,
you hear me?

42:49.917 --> 42:51.750
Get the hell out of there!
The crane's coming down!

42:54.083 --> 42:55.291
(One Night grunts)

43:00.959 --> 43:02.583
ONE NIGHT:
I'm okay. I'm clear, Bud.

43:07.375 --> 43:10.667
(sonar pinging)

43:14.000 --> 43:16.041
I've got it. It's headed
straight for us!

43:26.500 --> 43:29.834
(pinging increases in tempo)

43:50.875 --> 43:52.583
(sighs)
(all laugh)

44:21.875 --> 44:23.041
Oh, shit.

44:35.458 --> 44:38.333
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.
LINDSEY: Oh, my God!

44:39.583 --> 44:40.542
Bud!

44:40.625 --> 44:41.875
Grab on to something!

44:46.917 --> 44:48.291
(grunts)
Jesus!

44:57.125 --> 44:59.000
Battery rooms front.
Let's go!

44:59.083 --> 45:00.250
Cat, put that out!

45:02.792 --> 45:04.041
Bud,
Yeah!

45:04.125 --> 45:05.333
drillroom's flooding!

45:05.417 --> 45:06.291
Get back down there!

45:09.375 --> 45:12.166
Uhh! Go! I'll take
the battery room.

45:12.250 --> 45:13.125
Jesus!

45:21.417 --> 45:23.583
(alarm blaring)

45:24.500 --> 45:25.667
Uhh!

45:28.250 --> 45:30.583
(panting)

45:30.667 --> 45:31.792
Shit.

45:34.834 --> 45:36.542
Get out of there!

45:36.625 --> 45:37.500
Close the door!

45:37.583 --> 45:38.959
Seal the room!

45:47.250 --> 45:50.500
Lindsey,
let's get out of here!

46:00.542 --> 46:01.667
Whoa!

46:10.166 --> 46:11.667
(squeaking)

46:25.333 --> 46:27.625
(alarm blaring)

46:54.333 --> 46:56.208
Let's get the hell
out of here!

46:59.667 --> 47:00.667
Aah!

47:02.041 --> 47:05.917
Let's go! Let's go!
Get the door!

47:06.000 --> 47:07.375
Get the door!

47:08.875 --> 47:11.375
Ah, Jesus!

47:13.583 --> 47:16.750
(muffled):
Bud! Bud!

47:16.834 --> 47:19.083
(thumping)

47:24.458 --> 47:26.208
Philip,
cut the hose!

47:26.291 --> 47:28.375
Cut the line
to the motor!

47:28.458 --> 47:30.875
I can't open it
from out here!

47:30.959 --> 47:33.375
Philip,
cut the hose!

47:35.250 --> 47:37.125
(creaking)
Philip!

47:42.750 --> 47:43.750
God.

47:45.458 --> 47:47.709
(coughing)

47:54.041 --> 47:54.917
(grunts)

48:02.083 --> 48:03.041
Hey!

48:03.125 --> 48:04.667
Hey!

48:06.125 --> 48:07.542
Hey!

48:07.625 --> 48:09.458
Hey!

48:11.458 --> 48:12.542
Come on, Sonny!

48:12.625 --> 48:15.083
Hey, Cat! Cat!
Help me out, man!

48:15.166 --> 48:16.125
Hang on!

48:17.500 --> 48:18.917
(grunting)

48:19.000 --> 48:21.834
The hose! Cut the hose,
the line to the motor.

48:21.917 --> 48:22.959
Hurry up, man!

48:27.166 --> 48:28.000
Come on, Cat!

48:30.000 --> 48:31.542
Hurry!

48:31.625 --> 48:33.333
Come on, Sonny,
help me out. Come on,

48:33.417 --> 48:34.500
push!

48:35.291 --> 48:36.625
Come on, Sonny!

48:38.959 --> 48:41.291
Okay, let's go!
Come on, let's go!

48:41.375 --> 48:43.083
We got to go, go, go!

48:43.166 --> 48:45.208
Get out of here!
Come on! Move it!

48:45.291 --> 48:47.417
Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go, go!

48:47.500 --> 48:49.291
Get the hatch, Cat!

48:49.375 --> 48:51.542
Get the hatch!
Will you get the hatch?

48:59.709 --> 49:03.041
(heavy breathing)

49:05.333 --> 49:06.583
You all right?
Everybody okay?

49:06.667 --> 49:07.750
Yeah.
Yeah.

49:08.667 --> 49:10.542
Son of a bitch.

49:10.625 --> 49:11.834
Oh, man.

49:18.792 --> 49:20.917
SONNY (over radio):
Benthic Explorer
Benthic Explorer,

49:21.000 --> 49:22.917
this is Deep Core-2.
Do you read me?

49:26.208 --> 49:28.125
Benthic Explorer,
Benthic Explorer,

49:28.208 --> 49:29.250
this is Deep Core.

49:30.333 --> 49:31.792
Do you read me? Over.

49:31.875 --> 49:33.375
Forget it, Sonny.
They're gone, man.

49:37.500 --> 49:38.667
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

49:38.750 --> 49:39.709
Hey.

49:40.875 --> 49:42.041
They're gone.

49:51.667 --> 49:52.875
Hey, Jammer.

49:59.667 --> 50:03.000
MAN: Shh! I got it.
I'll deal with this, all right.

50:03.083 --> 50:04.166
I'll do it.

50:04.250 --> 50:05.542
Do it yourself.

50:06.583 --> 50:07.750
Find your buddy?

50:08.750 --> 50:09.667
Ah.

50:09.750 --> 50:11.041
-No.
-Tighter.

50:12.291 --> 50:13.291
Brigman!

50:13.375 --> 50:14.417
What?

50:16.250 --> 50:19.417
I was under orders.
I had no choice.

50:36.250 --> 50:37.583
How's it going, Cat?

50:48.458 --> 50:50.208
What's the scoop, ace?

50:50.291 --> 50:53.750
Well, I can get power
to this module and sub bay

50:53.834 --> 50:55.667
if I reroute
these buses,

50:55.750 --> 50:57.542
but I got to get
past the mains,

50:57.625 --> 50:59.125
which are a total meltdown.

51:01.000 --> 51:04.041
Bud, there won't be enough
to run the heaters.

51:04.125 --> 51:05.375
In a few hours,
this place is going to be

51:05.458 --> 51:06.750
as cold as a meat locker.

51:07.959 --> 51:09.375
What about O2?

51:09.458 --> 51:10.917
Yeah, well,
brace yourself.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.083
If we close off
the sections we're not using,

51:13.166 --> 51:14.667
we have about
maybe 12 hours' worth.

51:18.250 --> 51:21.375
The storm's going to last
a lot longer than 12 hours.

51:21.458 --> 51:25.625
Yeah, well, I can
maybe extend that, maybe.

51:26.917 --> 51:28.583
There's some
storage tanks outboard

51:28.667 --> 51:30.417
next to
the wrecked module.

51:30.500 --> 51:31.417
I'll have to go
outside, though,

51:31.500 --> 51:33.000
and tie on to them.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.000
Hey, Linds.

51:39.166 --> 51:40.792
-Linds.
-Yeah.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.417
I'm glad you're here.

51:43.500 --> 51:44.542
(sighs)
Yeah?

51:47.333 --> 51:48.834
I'm not.

52:00.166 --> 52:01.458
BUD (over radio):
Where are you now, Linds?

52:02.792 --> 52:05.041
I'm under the starboard
tri-module.

52:08.041 --> 52:09.083
Still with me, Hip?

52:09.166 --> 52:10.583
HIPPY (over radio):
Right behind you, Linds.

52:21.500 --> 52:22.625
How's it look?

52:22.709 --> 52:25.000
LINDSEY: Well, you guys
really screwed up my rig.

52:25.083 --> 52:26.792
There's a lot
of wreckage out here.

52:26.875 --> 52:28.208
Well, don't get fouled.

52:29.083 --> 52:31.166
Hit me with that
9/16ths, okay?

52:31.250 --> 52:32.625
Yeah.

52:32.709 --> 52:33.917
Thank you.

53:09.417 --> 53:11.750
HIPPY: Come on.
Let's see those muscles.

53:13.208 --> 53:14.750
Bingo. That's one.

53:16.250 --> 53:17.333
Two for two.

53:17.417 --> 53:18.542
Hey, hey.

53:21.041 --> 53:22.625
Lindsey,
do you read me? Over.

53:24.083 --> 53:26.417
Copy you, Hippy.
What's the matter?

53:28.250 --> 53:31.792
Oh, shit. The power's
jacking around with us again.

53:31.875 --> 53:33.166
Lindsey, come back.

53:33.250 --> 53:35.041
I just lost video.

53:35.125 --> 53:37.875
(audio fades)

53:37.959 --> 53:39.959
Hippy,
do you copy?

53:43.458 --> 53:44.625
Linds, you copy?

53:45.792 --> 53:48.041
Oh, shit.

53:48.125 --> 53:50.417
What the hell?
Hippy, do you copy?

53:52.291 --> 53:53.458
Damn it.

53:54.500 --> 53:56.250
Bud, do you copy?
Over.

53:58.917 --> 54:01.000
I seem to be having
a problem here.

55:06.208 --> 55:09.875
(whirring)

56:19.917 --> 56:21.291
Shit.

56:34.583 --> 56:35.834
Damn it.

56:45.750 --> 56:49.125
(shutter clicking)

57:08.875 --> 57:10.250
That's a great shot,
Lindsey.

57:10.333 --> 57:12.125
Did you drop
your dive line?

57:12.208 --> 57:14.458
No, come on, you guys.
Come on.

57:14.542 --> 57:16.625
Now, that's the smaller one.
This is the smaller one here.

57:16.709 --> 57:18.041
You can kind of see
how it's zigging around.

57:18.125 --> 57:19.542
Yeah,
whatever it is.

57:19.625 --> 57:21.041
I'm telling you
what it is.

57:21.125 --> 57:22.208
You're just not
hearing me.

57:22.291 --> 57:25.583
-Now, Lindsey--
-There is something
down there.

57:25.667 --> 57:26.709
Something not us.

57:26.792 --> 57:30.083
You could be
more specific.

57:30.166 --> 57:33.083
-Something that zigs.
-Not us.

57:33.166 --> 57:35.417
Not human.
Get it?

57:35.500 --> 57:38.709
Something nonhuman
but intelligent.

57:44.875 --> 57:48.250
A nonterrestrial intelligence.

57:48.333 --> 57:51.291
-A nonterrestrial intelligence.
-LINDSEY: Yes.

57:51.375 --> 57:54.583
NTIs! Oh, man,
that's better than UFOs!

57:54.667 --> 57:56.000
Oh, but that works,
too, huh?

57:56.083 --> 57:58.208
Underwater flying objects.

58:02.417 --> 58:04.792
Are we talking
little space friends here?

58:04.875 --> 58:06.792
Hell, yeah!
Hot rods of the Gods.

58:06.875 --> 58:08.625
Right, Linds?

58:08.709 --> 58:11.125
No, really.
It could be NTIs.

58:11.208 --> 58:12.917
The CIA has known
about them forever.

58:13.000 --> 58:15.166
They abduct people
all the time, man.

58:15.250 --> 58:17.125
You know, Hippy,
do me a favor.

58:17.208 --> 58:18.375
Stay off my side.

58:20.000 --> 58:22.083
-Will you step
into my office, please?
-Certainly.

58:23.709 --> 58:25.041
I--

58:25.125 --> 58:26.417
Come here.

58:28.083 --> 58:29.166
Jesus, Linds.

58:29.250 --> 58:31.166
Bud, come on, something really
important is happening here.

58:31.250 --> 58:32.959
I'm trying to keep
this situation under control.

58:33.041 --> 58:35.333
I can't allow you to create
this kind of hysteria.

58:35.417 --> 58:37.458
Who's hysterical?
Nobody's hysterical!

58:37.542 --> 58:38.625
Shhh!

58:40.041 --> 58:41.166
All I'm saying is

58:41.250 --> 58:42.333
when you're hanging on
by your fingernails,

58:42.417 --> 58:43.875
you don't go waving
your arms around.

58:43.959 --> 58:45.291
Look, I saw something.

58:45.375 --> 58:46.458
-I'm not going to
go in there and say...
-Shhh!

58:46.542 --> 58:49.166
...I didn't see it
when I did. I'm sorry.

58:49.250 --> 58:50.166
Please.

58:50.250 --> 58:52.000
You are the most
stubborn woman I ever knew.

58:52.083 --> 58:54.208
Yes, I am,

58:54.291 --> 58:56.208
but I need you
to believe me right now.

58:57.375 --> 58:59.667
Now, come on.
Look at me. Come on.

58:59.750 --> 59:00.667
Am I stressed out?

59:00.750 --> 59:02.333
Do I have any symptoms
of pressure sickness,

59:02.417 --> 59:03.917
tremor, slurred speech?

59:05.417 --> 59:06.375
No.

59:06.458 --> 59:08.000
No.

59:08.083 --> 59:10.291
Bud, this is me,
Lindsey, okay?

59:11.583 --> 59:14.291
You know me better
than anybody in the world.

59:15.583 --> 59:17.500
Now watch my lips.

59:17.583 --> 59:19.458
I saw these things.

59:20.792 --> 59:22.000
I touched one of them,

59:22.083 --> 59:25.208
and it wasn't some
clunky steel can

59:25.291 --> 59:26.625
like we would build.

59:29.125 --> 59:30.250
It glided.

59:31.291 --> 59:32.417
It was the most
beautiful thing

59:32.500 --> 59:33.959
I've ever seen.

59:35.667 --> 59:37.291
Oh, God, I wish
you'd been there.

59:38.291 --> 59:40.208
It was a machine.

59:40.291 --> 59:42.000
It was a machine,
but it was alive.

59:42.083 --> 59:44.000
It was like
a dance of light.

59:47.667 --> 59:48.875
Please,
you have to trust me.

59:50.333 --> 59:51.792
Now, I don't think
they mean us any harm.

59:51.875 --> 59:53.750
I don't know how
I know that.

59:53.834 --> 59:55.917
It's just a feeling.

59:56.000 --> 59:57.083
(scoffs)

59:57.166 --> 01:00:00.458
Geez. I'm supposed
to go on a feeling?

01:00:00.542 --> 01:00:01.709
How can I go
on a feeling?

01:00:01.792 --> 01:00:03.375
You think Coffey's
gonna go on a feeling?

01:00:03.458 --> 01:00:04.959
We all see
what we want to see.

01:00:06.333 --> 01:00:08.125
Coffey looks
and he sees Russians.

01:00:09.166 --> 01:00:10.542
He sees hate and fear.

01:00:12.625 --> 01:00:14.625
You have to look
with better eyes than that.

01:00:20.333 --> 01:00:21.375
Please.

01:00:22.625 --> 01:00:23.834
I can't, Linds.

01:00:25.875 --> 01:00:27.166
I'm sorry.

01:00:35.875 --> 01:00:37.208
Got it.

01:01:00.000 --> 01:01:01.625
All right.

01:01:01.709 --> 01:01:03.834
Come on.
A.J. squared-Away.

01:01:03.917 --> 01:01:05.542
A little to the left.

01:01:07.041 --> 01:01:08.333
What is that?

01:01:17.041 --> 01:01:19.041
Oh, this is not happening.

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:24.083
Oh, man.

01:01:27.625 --> 01:01:28.792
I'm shaking, man.

01:01:28.875 --> 01:01:30.291
All right.
Wait, wait, wait.

01:01:30.375 --> 01:01:32.166
And now...

01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:35.417
here's MIRV!

01:01:38.959 --> 01:01:41.500
Come on, man.
What else could it be?

01:01:41.583 --> 01:01:43.333
Why bring it here?

01:01:43.417 --> 01:01:45.500
It's got to be
some kind of emergency plan

01:01:45.583 --> 01:01:47.500
to keep it away
from the Russians, right?

01:01:47.583 --> 01:01:50.458
Look, look, they hot-wire
one of the nukes.

01:01:50.542 --> 01:01:52.208
They use some kind
of detonator

01:01:52.291 --> 01:01:53.166
that they brought,

01:01:53.250 --> 01:01:55.500
then they stick it
back in the sub.

01:01:55.583 --> 01:01:57.875
Fry the whole
thing up. Bam!

01:01:57.959 --> 01:01:59.500
Slicker than snot.

01:02:01.625 --> 01:02:03.041
I'm telling you,

01:02:03.125 --> 01:02:04.500
and I'm not being paranoi--

01:02:05.792 --> 01:02:07.125
Hi, Linds.

01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:17.709
Linds! Will you
just wait a second?

01:02:17.792 --> 01:02:18.667
Goddamn it!

01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:20.041
If you don't do something
about it, I will!

01:02:20.125 --> 01:02:21.917
Lindsey, we'll do
something about it!

01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.542
Wait a second.
Lindsey.

01:02:24.625 --> 01:02:25.709
What?

01:02:25.792 --> 01:02:27.792
-Just stop and think
about this for a second.
-What?

01:02:31.959 --> 01:02:33.250
(door opens)

01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.250
You know,
you got some huevos,

01:02:50.333 --> 01:02:51.834
bringing that thing
into my rig.

01:02:53.667 --> 01:02:55.417
With all that's going on
up in the world,

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:58.083
you bring a nuclear weapon
in here!

01:02:58.166 --> 01:02:59.250
Mrs. Brigman--

01:02:59.333 --> 01:03:01.875
Does this strike anyone
as particularly psychotic,

01:03:01.959 --> 01:03:03.458
or is it just me?

01:03:03.542 --> 01:03:05.250
Mrs. Brigman,
you don't need to know

01:03:05.333 --> 01:03:07.208
the details
of our operation.

01:03:07.291 --> 01:03:08.709
It's better
if you don't.

01:03:08.792 --> 01:03:10.208
You're right!
I don't need to know!

01:03:10.291 --> 01:03:12.083
What I need to know is
that thing is off this rig!

01:03:12.166 --> 01:03:14.709
Do you hear me,
Roger Ramjet?

01:03:16.750 --> 01:03:18.875
You're becoming a serious
impediment to our mission.

01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.750
Now you either do
an about-face

01:03:21.834 --> 01:03:23.333
and walk out of here,

01:03:23.417 --> 01:03:24.792
or I'll have you
escorted out.

01:03:24.875 --> 01:03:26.667
I will not do
an about-face

01:03:26.750 --> 01:03:28.000
and get out of here!

01:03:28.083 --> 01:03:29.834
Who the hell do you think
you're talking to?

01:03:29.917 --> 01:03:31.667
-(alarm rings)
-Emergency! Maintenance room B!

01:03:31.750 --> 01:03:33.458
Emergency!
Everybody move it!

01:03:33.542 --> 01:03:34.834
On the double!

01:03:34.917 --> 01:03:36.834
Now!

01:03:36.917 --> 01:03:39.583
In here! Come on!
We've got trouble!

01:03:39.667 --> 01:03:40.667
Come on!

01:03:40.750 --> 01:03:41.667
What's going on?

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:43.208
All right! All right!
All right! All right!

01:03:44.667 --> 01:03:46.500
ONE NIGHT: What's up?
What's happening?

01:03:46.583 --> 01:03:48.959
All right.
You let her go, man. Do it.

01:03:49.041 --> 01:03:50.792
Do it now!

01:03:50.875 --> 01:03:52.000
Let her go.

01:03:55.041 --> 01:03:56.667
The smartest thing
you ever did.

01:03:59.875 --> 01:04:02.125
-Coffey, you son--
-Lindsey!

01:04:02.208 --> 01:04:03.166
Cool it.

01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:04.625
-What's the problem?
-Nothing.

01:04:06.083 --> 01:04:08.375
We were just leaving.
Weren't we?

01:04:28.458 --> 01:04:29.917
We don't need them.

01:04:31.875 --> 01:04:33.583
We can't trust them.

01:04:38.125 --> 01:04:39.667
We may have to take steps.

01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:44.625
We're gonna have
to take steps.

01:04:49.125 --> 01:04:51.750
Linds, I want you
to stay away from that guy.

01:04:51.834 --> 01:04:53.041
I mean it.

01:04:53.125 --> 01:04:56.500
The guy is gone.
Did you see his hands?

01:04:56.583 --> 01:04:58.542
What? He's got
the shakes?

01:04:58.625 --> 01:05:00.834
Look, he's operating
on his own.

01:05:00.917 --> 01:05:03.041
He's cut off from
his chain of command.

01:05:03.125 --> 01:05:06.041
He's showing signs
of pressure-induced psychosis,

01:05:06.125 --> 01:05:08.125
and he's got
a nuclear weapon.

01:05:09.625 --> 01:05:11.208
So as
a personal favor to me,

01:05:11.291 --> 01:05:12.375
will you try
to put your tongue

01:05:12.458 --> 01:05:13.375
in neutral
for a while?

01:05:13.458 --> 01:05:15.041
I got to tell you,
I give this whole thing

01:05:15.125 --> 01:05:17.750
a sphincter factor
of about 9.5.

01:05:19.166 --> 01:05:21.750
Look, you can just punch
into his primary guidance chip

01:05:21.834 --> 01:05:23.750
where you want him to go,
and he'll go there, right?

01:05:23.834 --> 01:05:26.709
No. Bad idea,
Lindsey. Bad.

01:05:26.792 --> 01:05:27.625
Why, Hip? Come on.

01:05:27.709 --> 01:05:29.583
Because even if
it could take the pressure

01:05:29.667 --> 01:05:31.625
at that depth, which
I don't think it can...

01:05:31.709 --> 01:05:32.750
Yeah.

01:05:32.834 --> 01:05:34.208
...without the tether,
you know what would happen

01:05:34.291 --> 01:05:35.083
when it got down there?

01:05:35.166 --> 01:05:36.417
It would just sit
like a-- Please.

01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.583
It would just sit
like a dumb shit.

01:05:38.667 --> 01:05:41.083
Something would have to pass
in front of the camera

01:05:41.166 --> 01:05:42.208
for you to see anything.

01:05:42.291 --> 01:05:44.208
I know, but we could
get lucky, right?

01:05:44.291 --> 01:05:46.417
So we should go for it.

01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.792
I really ought to talk
to Bud about this.

01:05:47.875 --> 01:05:49.291
No. This is
between you and me.

01:05:49.375 --> 01:05:51.959
We get proof, and then
we tell the others.

01:05:52.041 --> 01:05:54.583
Hippy, look. If we
can prove to Coffey

01:05:54.667 --> 01:05:56.917
that there aren't
Russians down there,

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.000
maybe he'll ease off
the button a little bit.

01:06:00.542 --> 01:06:02.917
I got to tell you, man,
that guy scares me

01:06:03.041 --> 01:06:05.125
more than anything
we're gonna find down there.

01:06:05.208 --> 01:06:08.000
He's a goddamn,
A.J. squared-away,

01:06:08.083 --> 01:06:10.375
jar-head robot.

01:06:13.041 --> 01:06:14.458
All right. Give me
a couple hours.

01:06:14.542 --> 01:06:15.500
I'll see what I can do.

01:06:15.583 --> 01:06:17.208
Great. Thanks.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.000
(snoring)

01:06:30.834 --> 01:06:32.375
Virgil,
turn on your side.

01:06:39.041 --> 01:06:43.250
(sonar pinging)

01:07:02.583 --> 01:07:05.375
All right.
You're all set, big guy.

01:07:05.458 --> 01:07:07.959
Hey, I told you to wipe
that grin off your face.

01:07:17.458 --> 01:07:18.792
Good night,
little buddy.

01:08:10.333 --> 01:08:13.709
(water dripping)

01:09:05.332 --> 01:09:06.375
(gasps)

01:09:08.207 --> 01:09:09.959
(softly):
Bud. Bud!

01:09:10.041 --> 01:09:11.875
Bud, get up!

01:09:15.041 --> 01:09:16.375
What?

01:09:26.417 --> 01:09:28.000
Cat.

01:09:29.542 --> 01:09:30.500
Cat!

01:09:30.582 --> 01:09:33.582
Hey! God--
leave me alone.

01:09:42.041 --> 01:09:43.582
Bud.

01:09:46.792 --> 01:09:48.959
Okay. It's okay.

01:09:49.041 --> 01:09:51.125
Sweet Christ almighty.

01:09:51.207 --> 01:09:52.582
I think
it likes you.

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:14.625
It's trying
to communicate.

01:10:17.083 --> 01:10:18.458
ONE NIGHT:
It's Bud.

01:10:22.125 --> 01:10:23.333
That's wonderful.

01:10:23.417 --> 01:10:24.625
It's me.

01:10:28.291 --> 01:10:29.208
No, no, no, no, no.

01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:30.542
Shhh! It's okay.
It's good.

01:10:30.625 --> 01:10:31.750
ONE NIGHT:
What is it?

01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.291
Is it alive?

01:10:40.291 --> 01:10:41.583
BUD: Lindsey, no.

01:10:43.750 --> 01:10:44.917
Seawater.

01:10:45.792 --> 01:10:47.250
ONE NIGHT:
Man.

01:11:00.834 --> 01:11:02.333
Come on. Come on!

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.291
-Hurry.
-BUD: Where the hell's
it going?

01:11:08.959 --> 01:11:10.041
Huh?

01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.166
LINDSEY: Hurry. I think
it's headed for "B" module.

01:11:21.709 --> 01:11:22.667
Linds, you see it?

01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:53.583
(all scream)

01:11:57.917 --> 01:11:59.709
(screaming)

01:12:13.875 --> 01:12:16.875
(pinging)

01:12:23.083 --> 01:12:24.291
LINDSEY: So raise
your hand if you think

01:12:24.375 --> 01:12:26.041
that was a Russian
water tentacle.

01:12:27.625 --> 01:12:28.875
Lieutenant?

01:12:29.750 --> 01:12:31.208
No? Well...

01:12:32.959 --> 01:12:34.375
a breakthrough.

01:12:35.417 --> 01:12:36.500
Hey, ace,

01:12:36.583 --> 01:12:38.125
you done
impressing yourself?

01:12:38.208 --> 01:12:40.417
No way that thing
could just be seawater.

01:12:41.458 --> 01:12:43.000
They must have learned
to control water.

01:12:43.083 --> 01:12:45.333
I mean,
at a molecular level.

01:12:45.417 --> 01:12:47.458
You know, they can,
they can plasticize it.

01:12:47.542 --> 01:12:48.291
They can polymerize it,

01:12:48.375 --> 01:12:49.250
do whatever they want
to do with it.

01:12:49.333 --> 01:12:52.333
They can put it
under intelligent control.

01:12:52.417 --> 01:12:56.542
Maybe their whole technology's
based on that.

01:12:56.625 --> 01:12:58.250
-LINDSEY: What?
-Controlling water.

01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:00.917
HIPPY: Was it
the same thing

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.875
that you saw
the last time?

01:13:02.959 --> 01:13:04.041
LINDSEY: No.

01:13:04.125 --> 01:13:06.041
You know,
I don't think that

01:13:06.125 --> 01:13:08.000
that thing you saw
was one of them.

01:13:08.083 --> 01:13:09.208
What are you
talking about?

01:13:09.291 --> 01:13:11.500
I mean, I don't think
it was an NTI.

01:13:11.583 --> 01:13:12.834
I think it was like

01:13:12.917 --> 01:13:15.166
their version of an ROV,
like Big Geek.

01:13:16.959 --> 01:13:18.834
CATFISH: Hippy, you mean
they was just checking us out?

01:13:18.917 --> 01:13:20.375
HIPPY: Yeah.

01:13:20.458 --> 01:13:21.375
CATFISH: How come?

01:13:21.458 --> 01:13:22.834
LINDSEY:
Curious, I suppose.

01:13:22.917 --> 01:13:23.917
We're probably
the first people

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:25.583
they've ever seen.

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:44.458
It went straight
for the warhead,

01:13:44.542 --> 01:13:46.000
and they think
it's cute.

01:13:54.166 --> 01:13:55.834
(objects clattering)

01:14:06.041 --> 01:14:07.458
You need to get
some sleep.

01:14:18.166 --> 01:14:23.083
We have no way
of warning the surface.

01:14:24.208 --> 01:14:25.667
And you know
what that means.

01:14:29.083 --> 01:14:30.500
It means
whatever happens

01:14:31.709 --> 01:14:33.083
is up to us.

01:14:34.875 --> 01:14:36.166
Us!

01:15:05.083 --> 01:15:07.959
(clicking)

01:15:52.792 --> 01:15:54.125
(gasps)

01:15:57.625 --> 01:15:58.834
Sniff something?

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:04.458
Did you, rat boy?

01:16:09.333 --> 01:16:10.625
Hey, hey, hey!

01:16:11.625 --> 01:16:13.041
Freeze!

01:16:13.125 --> 01:16:14.417
Don't move!

01:16:16.458 --> 01:16:17.291
That's right.

01:16:19.083 --> 01:16:20.166
You okay, Hip?

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:21.750
They're using Big Geek
to take the bomb

01:16:21.834 --> 01:16:23.000
to the NTIs.

01:16:23.083 --> 01:16:24.208
What?

01:16:24.291 --> 01:16:25.917
We set it up
to go right to them.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:27.875
Oh, my God.

01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:29.458
Oh, my God.

01:16:29.542 --> 01:16:30.875
Take this.

01:16:30.959 --> 01:16:32.917
We're going
to phase three.

01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.583
What? We don't have
orders for that.

01:16:35.667 --> 01:16:37.583
HIPPY: I programed
Big Geek to go down

01:16:37.667 --> 01:16:39.750
to the bottom of the trench
and shoot some video.

01:16:39.834 --> 01:16:41.792
Now they got the warhead
tied to it.

01:16:41.875 --> 01:16:43.291
Coffey.

01:16:46.166 --> 01:16:47.083
-BUD: Linds.
-Coffey-- No.

01:16:47.166 --> 01:16:48.375
Come on.

01:16:48.458 --> 01:16:50.625
Coffey, just think about
what you're doing, okay?

01:16:50.709 --> 01:16:53.291
Just one minute. Just think
about what you're doing--

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:54.625
Get back!

01:16:56.667 --> 01:16:58.291
This is something
I've wanted to do

01:16:58.375 --> 01:17:00.291
since we first met.

01:17:00.375 --> 01:17:01.792
(ripping)

01:17:08.458 --> 01:17:10.709
Easy. Easy. Easy.

01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:14.625
All right.
Into the kitchen, let's go!

01:17:14.709 --> 01:17:15.500
Move, partner!

01:17:15.583 --> 01:17:16.959
Get your damn hands
off of me!

01:17:17.041 --> 01:17:18.792
I know the way.

01:17:18.875 --> 01:17:20.458
Your boss is fixing
to pull the pin

01:17:20.542 --> 01:17:22.625
on 50 kilotons!

01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:25.166
And we're all
gonna be ringside!

01:17:25.250 --> 01:17:27.667
He's having
a full-on meltdown!

01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:29.333
What's the timer
set for?

01:17:29.417 --> 01:17:30.750
-Three hours.
-Shut up. Don't talk.

01:17:30.834 --> 01:17:32.083
Three hours.

01:17:32.166 --> 01:17:33.959
We can't get to
minimum safe distance

01:17:34.041 --> 01:17:35.333
in three hours.

01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:37.625
We can't go
to phase three.

01:17:37.709 --> 01:17:38.917
What about
these people?

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000
Shut up. What's
the matter with you?

01:17:47.917 --> 01:17:49.667
Everybody just stay calm.

01:17:49.750 --> 01:17:51.417
The situation is
under control.

01:17:57.125 --> 01:17:58.959
Anybody touches
that door, kill them.

01:18:04.375 --> 01:18:06.291
Schoenick, your lieutenant's
about to make

01:18:06.375 --> 01:18:07.166
a real bad career move.

01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:09.875
The guy's crazier
than a shit-house rat!

01:18:09.959 --> 01:18:11.500
LINDSEY: We're trying
to make contact!

01:18:11.583 --> 01:18:12.959
Can't you see
he's lost it?

01:18:13.041 --> 01:18:14.000
Shut up!

01:18:14.083 --> 01:18:15.458
The shock wave
will kill us.

01:18:15.542 --> 01:18:16.625
Quiet!

01:18:16.709 --> 01:18:18.667
It will crush this rig
like a beer can.

01:18:18.750 --> 01:18:19.500
Shut up, man!
What are you talking about?

01:18:19.583 --> 01:18:22.500
-We've got to stop him.
-Shut up!

01:18:22.583 --> 01:18:24.333
This is not
our mission.

01:18:24.417 --> 01:18:26.000
We can't detonate
without orders.

01:18:26.083 --> 01:18:27.291
LINDSEY:
Schoenick, please!

01:18:40.291 --> 01:18:41.291
Schoenick, listen.

01:18:41.375 --> 01:18:43.250
He's about to declare war
on an alien species

01:18:43.333 --> 01:18:45.333
just when they're trying
to make contact with us!

01:18:45.417 --> 01:18:46.542
Please!

01:18:46.625 --> 01:18:47.875
I don't know.
I think I'm reaching him.

01:18:47.959 --> 01:18:49.250
(scoffs)
Yeah.

01:18:49.333 --> 01:18:50.458
(door opening)

01:18:51.583 --> 01:18:53.625
Ho ho ho ho.
I'll be damned.

01:18:57.291 --> 01:18:58.417
Jammer!

01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:00.208
Is everybody okay?

01:19:00.291 --> 01:19:01.750
ONE NIGHT:
Oh, man!

01:19:02.625 --> 01:19:04.208
Don't move, jar face!

01:19:04.291 --> 01:19:06.041
Look, I'm the least
of your problems.

01:19:06.125 --> 01:19:08.375
-Take it easy, Hip.
-I'm all right.

01:19:08.458 --> 01:19:09.917
How you feeling,
big guy?

01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:11.125
I'm okay, Bud.

01:19:12.125 --> 01:19:15.583
I just figured
I was dead back there

01:19:15.667 --> 01:19:17.667
when I saw that angel
coming for me.

01:19:18.875 --> 01:19:21.375
Uh...yeah, okay.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:24.500
Yeah. Why don't you
tell us about it later?

01:19:31.125 --> 01:19:32.709
Come on.

01:19:32.792 --> 01:19:34.291
He's got it tied off
with something.

01:19:34.375 --> 01:19:35.542
Come on. Ready?

01:19:39.166 --> 01:19:41.583
We're not going
to be able to budge it.

01:19:41.667 --> 01:19:44.000
Now what? This is
the only door to sub bay.

01:19:55.667 --> 01:19:56.750
What are you doing?

01:19:56.834 --> 01:19:58.625
I'm going to swim
to hatch six.

01:19:58.709 --> 01:20:00.000
What?

01:20:02.041 --> 01:20:03.583
I'm going to get inside,

01:20:03.667 --> 01:20:04.625
and then I'm going
to open the door

01:20:04.709 --> 01:20:05.750
from the other side.

01:20:05.834 --> 01:20:06.875
Bud, this water
is freezing.

01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:10.583
Then I guess you better
wish me luck, huh?

01:20:10.667 --> 01:20:12.083
Wish us luck.

01:20:12.166 --> 01:20:13.125
BUD: You coming along?

01:20:13.208 --> 01:20:14.375
CATFISH: Looks that way.

01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:17.834
All right, Cat.

01:20:17.917 --> 01:20:18.875
Come on, Bud.

01:20:19.875 --> 01:20:21.333
In case I don't die.

01:20:21.417 --> 01:20:22.959
ONE NIGHT:
This is insane.

01:20:23.041 --> 01:20:23.834
Come on, Bud.

01:20:23.917 --> 01:20:25.709
Let's go, partner.
I ain't got all day.

01:20:28.333 --> 01:20:30.542
(exhaling forcefully)

01:21:07.125 --> 01:21:08.291
(creaking)

01:21:21.458 --> 01:21:22.667
(gasps)

01:21:26.667 --> 01:21:27.583
I got it.

01:21:27.667 --> 01:21:28.959
(grunting)

01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:34.792
We're gonna have to--

01:21:36.125 --> 01:21:37.458
We're gonna have to go
to the moon pool.

01:21:38.792 --> 01:21:39.875
It's the only way.

01:21:39.959 --> 01:21:41.166
I can't.

01:21:41.250 --> 01:21:43.208
I can't make it,
partner.

01:21:43.291 --> 01:21:44.500
I'm sorry.

01:21:46.792 --> 01:21:48.208
Okay.

01:21:48.291 --> 01:21:50.750
Okay, Cat. You head
on back, all right?

01:21:52.125 --> 01:21:54.583
(exhaling forcefully)

01:22:13.333 --> 01:22:16.166
(clicking)

01:23:25.542 --> 01:23:26.959
What is he doing?

01:23:27.041 --> 01:23:28.500
He can't make it
to the door.

01:23:28.583 --> 01:23:30.291
He's going to try
and take him out himself.

01:23:32.041 --> 01:23:33.000
God, he couldn't be
that dumb.

01:23:33.083 --> 01:23:34.458
That guy's
a trained killer.

01:24:24.333 --> 01:24:25.834
No!

01:24:25.917 --> 01:24:27.583
Coffey.

01:24:27.667 --> 01:24:28.542
Coffey, listen.

01:24:28.625 --> 01:24:29.834
(click)

01:24:42.458 --> 01:24:43.458
Hey!

01:25:27.291 --> 01:25:28.542
(Bud coughing)

01:25:35.834 --> 01:25:36.667
(grunting)

01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:38.083
(screaming)

01:25:56.375 --> 01:25:57.375
Aah!

01:25:59.250 --> 01:26:01.166
(choking, gasping)

01:26:04.041 --> 01:26:04.875
Hey!

01:26:21.083 --> 01:26:22.166
CATFISH: Bud,
you all right?

01:26:22.250 --> 01:26:23.417
Get him, Cat!

01:26:30.083 --> 01:26:31.792
He's locked it, Bud.

01:26:31.875 --> 01:26:33.208
We got to get this
off of here.

01:26:37.250 --> 01:26:38.625
Come on, help me.

01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:40.041
Pull the gripper!
Pull it!

01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:52.083
Cat, get the door.

01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:03.333
Shit.

01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:05.625
Come on.

01:27:07.834 --> 01:27:08.542
Shoot! Shoot!

01:27:08.625 --> 01:27:09.750
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

01:27:09.834 --> 01:27:12.417
The safety's on.
Safety's on!

01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:13.792
Give me that.

01:27:16.625 --> 01:27:18.750
(bullets pinging)

01:27:19.792 --> 01:27:21.542
Come on, let's go!
Help me out!

01:27:21.625 --> 01:27:22.709
Give me a hand.
Let's move it!

01:27:22.792 --> 01:27:24.417
One Night,
what about Cab 1?

01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:25.917
Ready to launch.

01:27:27.458 --> 01:27:28.166
Go!

01:27:28.250 --> 01:27:29.959
You're better
in these than I am.

01:27:30.959 --> 01:27:31.959
-You got air?
-Come on. Come on.

01:27:34.959 --> 01:27:37.667
You got air. You got air.
You got air. You got air.

01:28:28.375 --> 01:28:29.583
Shit!

01:29:26.291 --> 01:29:29.375
(music plays on stereo)

01:29:32.959 --> 01:29:34.625
(music stops)

01:30:01.750 --> 01:30:02.834
LINDSEY:
Bud, get out of the way!

01:30:10.583 --> 01:30:11.625
Shit.

01:30:34.333 --> 01:30:35.750
Get in!

01:30:35.834 --> 01:30:37.250
Hurry up!

01:30:37.333 --> 01:30:38.709
I'm coming, baby.

01:30:38.792 --> 01:30:40.375
Keep your panty hose on.

01:30:50.041 --> 01:30:51.041
Are you okay?

01:30:51.125 --> 01:30:52.000
Yeah.

01:30:55.625 --> 01:30:56.583
Do you see Big Geek?

01:30:56.667 --> 01:30:58.500
Yeah.
Right out in front.

01:31:06.000 --> 01:31:07.792
-Oh, my God!
-Get after him.

01:31:07.875 --> 01:31:09.417
Okay, okay, okay.
Get on the arm.

01:31:09.500 --> 01:31:11.291
BUD: Stop. To the left.
Little more.

01:31:11.375 --> 01:31:12.208
LINDSEY: You missed.
Try it again.

01:31:12.291 --> 01:31:14.125
Steady. Steady. Steady.
Steady. Steady.

01:31:14.208 --> 01:31:15.417
-Okay. Grab it!
-Yeah.

01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:16.458
Got it!

01:31:16.542 --> 01:31:17.458
Pretty slick, slick.

01:31:17.542 --> 01:31:19.667
Hold it really steady.
Just-- just hold it still.

01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:21.250
-Hold it still.
-I am. I am.

01:31:28.875 --> 01:31:30.208
Aah!

01:31:32.208 --> 01:31:34.250
Shit!
We lost Geek!

01:31:41.208 --> 01:31:42.333
Where is he, Bud?
Do you see him?

01:31:42.417 --> 01:31:43.709
I'll take a look.

01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:48.291
He's coming up fast.
Step on it.

01:31:48.375 --> 01:31:49.625
Shit!

01:31:59.792 --> 01:32:01.125
Go to the right.
Swing to the right.

01:32:01.208 --> 01:32:02.583
Shit.

01:32:18.750 --> 01:32:20.375
BUD:
Keep moving, baby.

01:32:22.917 --> 01:32:23.750
Come here.

01:32:25.750 --> 01:32:27.000
That's right.

01:32:27.083 --> 01:32:28.250
(grunting)

01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:31.917
BUD:
Son of a bitch!

01:32:40.250 --> 01:32:41.959
Hard left, baby.
Left, left, left!

01:32:56.166 --> 01:32:57.750
Jesus Christ, lady.

01:32:57.834 --> 01:32:59.166
Bud, if you think
you can do any better,

01:32:59.250 --> 01:33:00.500
then you're
welcome up here.

01:33:07.792 --> 01:33:09.041
Son of a bitch!

01:33:11.667 --> 01:33:12.542
Is he right on us?

01:33:12.625 --> 01:33:13.875
Yeah, he's right
on your ass.

01:33:13.959 --> 01:33:15.417
Okay. Okay.

01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:16.417
Where are you going?

01:33:16.500 --> 01:33:17.625
Hang on.

01:33:46.458 --> 01:33:48.834
(grunting)

01:34:36.583 --> 01:34:38.750
(heavy breathing)

01:34:53.083 --> 01:34:55.750
Aah!

01:35:01.959 --> 01:35:03.375
LINDSEY (over radio):
Deep Core, This is Cab 1.

01:35:03.458 --> 01:35:04.917
Do you read?

01:35:07.375 --> 01:35:09.625
Deep Core, Deep Core,
this is Cab 1. Over.

01:35:11.583 --> 01:35:12.917
I'm not getting
any answer...

01:35:14.917 --> 01:35:17.041
and we're flooding
like a son of a bitch.

01:35:17.125 --> 01:35:18.709
Yeah. You noticed?

01:35:18.792 --> 01:35:21.333
You know, you did okay
back there, Virgil.

01:35:21.417 --> 01:35:22.583
I was fairly impressed.

01:35:22.667 --> 01:35:24.417
Yeah? Well,
not good enough.

01:35:24.500 --> 01:35:26.250
We still got
to catch Big Geek.

01:35:26.333 --> 01:35:28.542
Yeah? Well,
not in this thing.

01:35:28.625 --> 01:35:30.959
Deep Core, Deep Core,
this is Cab 1. Over.

01:35:34.625 --> 01:35:36.542
Try it again.

01:35:36.625 --> 01:35:38.458
Deep Core, this is Cab 1.
We need a--

01:35:39.792 --> 01:35:41.083
Aah!

01:35:42.625 --> 01:35:43.500
You all right?

01:35:44.792 --> 01:35:45.667
Yeah.

01:35:52.458 --> 01:35:53.333
Well, that's that.

01:35:53.417 --> 01:35:54.667
Yeah. Wonderful.

01:35:57.291 --> 01:35:59.417
There's a light
coming from somewhere.

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:00.959
It's off to the right.

01:36:01.041 --> 01:36:02.625
Yeah.
That's the rig.

01:36:02.709 --> 01:36:05.250
It's a good 60,
70 yards, I'd say.

01:36:05.333 --> 01:36:07.709
Well, they'll come after us.

01:36:07.792 --> 01:36:10.291
Yeah, but it's gonna take them
a while to get here.

01:36:10.375 --> 01:36:11.792
We got to get
this flooding stopped.

01:36:14.500 --> 01:36:15.709
Can you see where
it's coming in?

01:36:15.792 --> 01:36:17.792
Yeah. Can you hold
the lamp for me?

01:36:17.875 --> 01:36:19.583
There's a busted fitting
behind this panel.

01:36:19.667 --> 01:36:21.458
Problem is, I don't
think I can get to it.

01:36:25.041 --> 01:36:26.208
You got any tools?

01:36:26.291 --> 01:36:28.417
Uh, I don't know.
I'll have to look around.

01:36:28.500 --> 01:36:29.875
Yeah? Well,
I looked already.

01:36:32.834 --> 01:36:35.500
Goddamn it! All I need's
a goddamn crescent wrench.

01:36:39.083 --> 01:36:40.834
Come on.
(grunting)

01:36:46.542 --> 01:36:48.250
Son of a bitch!

01:36:48.333 --> 01:36:50.208
Okay. Calm down, Bud.

01:36:51.375 --> 01:36:52.291
Calm down.

01:36:52.375 --> 01:36:53.583
-Okay.
-Okay.

01:36:56.709 --> 01:36:57.750
Okay.

01:37:00.542 --> 01:37:02.667
We got to get you
out of here.

01:37:02.750 --> 01:37:04.000
How?

01:37:04.083 --> 01:37:05.291
I don't know how.

01:37:05.375 --> 01:37:07.166
All right. We've only
got one suit.

01:37:07.250 --> 01:37:08.959
I know, but we've got
to come up with something.

01:37:09.041 --> 01:37:10.333
Oh, my God!
I'm freezing!

01:37:10.417 --> 01:37:12.625
Come here. Come here.
Give me your hands.

01:37:12.709 --> 01:37:14.792
Listen. You're smart.
Think of something.

01:37:14.875 --> 01:37:16.500
Can't you think of something?
Think of something.

01:37:16.583 --> 01:37:18.959
Okay. Why don't you
swim back to the rig

01:37:19.041 --> 01:37:21.667
and bring back
another suit?

01:37:21.750 --> 01:37:25.291
That would take me
about 7, 8 minutes to swim,

01:37:25.375 --> 01:37:28.041
get the gear, come back.

01:37:28.125 --> 01:37:29.375
I wouldn't make it.
Look at this.

01:37:29.458 --> 01:37:30.750
By the time I got back,
you'd be--

01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:34.542
Okay, okay.
Let's look around.

01:37:34.625 --> 01:37:36.542
Just look.
Oh, my God.

01:37:38.709 --> 01:37:39.917
Is that working?

01:37:41.875 --> 01:37:43.083
Shit.

01:37:53.917 --> 01:37:55.166
All right. All right.
All right. All right.

01:37:55.250 --> 01:37:56.667
Bud, I'm getting cold.

01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:58.625
Here.
You put this on.

01:37:58.709 --> 01:37:59.667
No! No!
What are you doing?

01:37:59.750 --> 01:38:02.166
Don't argue with me,
goddamn it! Just put it on.

01:38:02.250 --> 01:38:03.667
No. Look, this is
not an option,

01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:05.000
so just forget
about it, all right?

01:38:05.083 --> 01:38:06.875
Lindsey, shut up! Shut up
and put this thing on.

01:38:06.959 --> 01:38:08.583
-Look, will you be logical?
-Fuck logic!

01:38:08.667 --> 01:38:11.375
For one second, please listen.
Just listen for one second.

01:38:11.458 --> 01:38:12.834
Now, you've got
the suit on,

01:38:12.917 --> 01:38:14.709
and you're a much better
swimmer than I am, right?

01:38:14.792 --> 01:38:16.542
-Yeah, maybe.
-Right? Yes!

01:38:16.625 --> 01:38:17.417
So I've got a plan.

01:38:17.500 --> 01:38:19.041
What's the plan?

01:38:19.125 --> 01:38:20.750
I drown, and you tow me
back to the rig.

01:38:20.834 --> 01:38:22.041
No! No!

01:38:22.125 --> 01:38:25.041
Yes. This water is only a couple
of degrees above freezing.

01:38:25.125 --> 01:38:27.750
I go into
deep hypothermia.

01:38:27.834 --> 01:38:30.083
My blood will go
like ice water, right?

01:38:30.166 --> 01:38:31.375
My body systems
will slow down.

01:38:31.458 --> 01:38:32.875
-They won't stop.
-Linds.

01:38:32.959 --> 01:38:34.667
You tow me back,
and I can--

01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:36.041
I can be revived

01:38:36.125 --> 01:38:38.375
after maybe 10
or 15 minutes.

01:38:38.458 --> 01:38:40.166
Lindsey, put this on.
You put it on.

01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:42.917
No. It's the only way.
You just put this on.

01:38:43.041 --> 01:38:44.291
Put this on.
You know I'm right.

01:38:44.375 --> 01:38:46.250
Please.
It's the only way.

01:38:46.333 --> 01:38:49.792
You've got all the s-stuff
on the rig to do this.

01:38:49.875 --> 01:38:52.041
Put this on, Bud, please.

01:38:53.333 --> 01:38:55.250
-This is insane.
-I know.

01:38:55.333 --> 01:38:56.583
Oh, my God.

01:38:56.667 --> 01:38:57.875
You okay?

01:38:57.959 --> 01:38:59.542
It's the only way.

01:38:59.625 --> 01:39:00.792
Here. Hold this.

01:39:04.458 --> 01:39:06.125
Son of a bitch.
Hold on, Lindsey.

01:39:09.125 --> 01:39:10.291
You can do this,
you know.

01:39:16.166 --> 01:39:17.709
You can do this.

01:39:17.792 --> 01:39:18.875
Oh, God, Lindsey. I--

01:39:18.959 --> 01:39:20.709
I know. You can
tell me later.

01:39:30.417 --> 01:39:31.542
LINDSEY:
Oh, God.

01:39:34.208 --> 01:39:36.041
(sobbing)

01:39:39.166 --> 01:39:41.542
This is maybe not
such a good idea.

01:39:43.250 --> 01:39:45.625
Oh, my God!

01:39:45.709 --> 01:39:47.500
Bud! No!

01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:59.875
I can't, Bud!
Oh, Bud, I'm scared!

01:40:31.125 --> 01:40:34.917
No!

01:40:57.792 --> 01:40:59.166
I got him.
I got him.

01:40:59.250 --> 01:41:00.041
Where?

01:41:00.125 --> 01:41:01.542
Oh, my God.
It's Lindsey.

01:41:01.625 --> 01:41:02.583
BUD (over radio):
Deep Core.

01:41:02.667 --> 01:41:03.709
Deep Core,
do you read? Over.

01:41:03.792 --> 01:41:05.083
Yeah. We got you,
Bud. We're here.

01:41:05.166 --> 01:41:07.083
Go to the infirmary.

01:41:07.166 --> 01:41:10.875
Get the cart oxygen,
defib kit,

01:41:10.959 --> 01:41:14.250
adrenaline and a 10 cc syringe,
some heating blankets.

01:41:14.333 --> 01:41:15.333
You got all that?

01:41:15.417 --> 01:41:16.375
Got it. Over.

01:41:16.458 --> 01:41:17.875
Meet me at the moon pool,
and make it fast!

01:41:17.959 --> 01:41:19.208
Now! Come on!
Let's go.

01:41:19.291 --> 01:41:21.250
Hippy,
get the hot packs.

01:41:21.333 --> 01:41:22.625
Got it.

01:41:39.375 --> 01:41:40.625
Here he comes!

01:41:47.125 --> 01:41:47.875
Get her up.

01:41:47.959 --> 01:41:49.250
Watch her head.
Watch her head.

01:41:49.333 --> 01:41:50.458
ONE NIGHT:
I got it. I got it.

01:41:50.542 --> 01:41:51.792
BUD:
Watch her feet.

01:41:54.667 --> 01:41:55.750
Watch her head
coming down.

01:41:55.834 --> 01:41:56.834
Watch her head.

01:42:03.291 --> 01:42:04.625
CATFISH: Suck it out.
Clear it out.

01:42:04.709 --> 01:42:06.125
Is she cleared?
Is she cleared?

01:42:06.208 --> 01:42:08.750
Get the defib ready.
Hurry up, Cat.

01:42:08.834 --> 01:42:10.834
Okay, okay. I got it.

01:42:12.208 --> 01:42:13.667
-Okay?
-Yeah.

01:42:15.417 --> 01:42:17.750
Three-one thousand,
four-one thousand, five.

01:42:17.834 --> 01:42:18.875
Breathe.

01:42:20.083 --> 01:42:21.750
One-one thousand,
two-one thousand,

01:42:21.834 --> 01:42:23.166
three-one thousand,
four-one thousand--

01:42:23.250 --> 01:42:24.250
No, no, no, no.
It won't work.

01:42:24.333 --> 01:42:26.625
She's got to have bare skin,
or it won't work.

01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:29.667
Three-one thousand,
four-one thousand, breathe.

01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:30.917
CATFISH: Here.

01:42:32.250 --> 01:42:33.250
Is that right?
Is this it?

01:42:33.333 --> 01:42:34.583
-I've got it.
-Well, do it!

01:42:34.667 --> 01:42:36.083
-All right.
-HIPPY: Breathe.

01:42:36.166 --> 01:42:37.333
(defibrillator beeping)

01:42:37.417 --> 01:42:38.458
Come on, zap her!

01:42:38.542 --> 01:42:39.875
Clear!

01:42:41.583 --> 01:42:43.166
Come on, baby.
Aw, Christ!

01:42:43.250 --> 01:42:45.041
-Nothing.
-Breathe.

01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:46.834
I'll check out 300.

01:42:46.917 --> 01:42:47.750
Nothing.

01:42:47.834 --> 01:42:49.917
Do it again, One Night.
Zap her again.

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.500
It's going. It's going.
It's charging.

01:42:52.583 --> 01:42:54.333
Three-one thousand,
four-one thousand.

01:42:54.417 --> 01:42:56.709
Charging,
charging, charging...

01:42:56.792 --> 01:42:57.625
Clear!

01:42:59.417 --> 01:43:00.375
BUD:
Is there anything?

01:43:00.458 --> 01:43:01.291
ONE NIGHT:
No pulse.

01:43:01.375 --> 01:43:02.333
Come on, baby.

01:43:02.417 --> 01:43:03.709
It's charging.
One more time.

01:43:03.792 --> 01:43:04.625
Zap her again.

01:43:05.709 --> 01:43:07.500
Come on!

01:43:07.583 --> 01:43:08.375
Come on!

01:43:08.458 --> 01:43:09.417
Clear!

01:43:12.583 --> 01:43:14.000
God!
No pulse!

01:43:14.083 --> 01:43:16.375
It's flat.
Goddamn, it's flat.

01:43:20.083 --> 01:43:22.291
Three, four, five.
One thousand.

01:43:22.375 --> 01:43:25.208
One, two, three four.
Breathe.

01:43:25.291 --> 01:43:28.208
One, two, three four.
Breathe.

01:43:35.417 --> 01:43:37.208
Three-one thousand.
Come on, baby.

01:43:37.291 --> 01:43:38.917
One-one thousand,
Two-one thousand,

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.834
Three-one thousand,
four-one thousand.

01:43:41.959 --> 01:43:42.709
Come on, baby.
Come on.

01:43:42.792 --> 01:43:44.208
One-one thousand,
two-one thousand,

01:43:44.291 --> 01:43:45.667
three-one thousand,
four-one thousand,

01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:47.917
five-one thousand.
Come on, baby. Breathe.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.375
Come on.
Two-one thousand.

01:43:49.458 --> 01:43:50.375
-three-one thousand...
-Bud.

01:43:50.458 --> 01:43:52.041
-four-one thousand.
-Bud.

01:43:52.125 --> 01:43:54.125
Bud. Bud.

01:43:56.333 --> 01:43:57.625
It's all over, man.

01:44:00.625 --> 01:44:01.625
It's all over.

01:44:02.792 --> 01:44:03.834
I'm sorry.

01:44:05.125 --> 01:44:06.125
No pulse.

01:44:29.166 --> 01:44:30.750
No!

01:44:30.834 --> 01:44:32.250
No. She has
a strong heart!

01:44:32.333 --> 01:44:33.750
She wants to live!

01:44:33.834 --> 01:44:35.792
Come on, Linds.
Come on, baby!

01:45:09.583 --> 01:45:11.625
Zap her again.
Do it!

01:45:11.709 --> 01:45:12.750
-Charging.
-Do it!

01:45:12.834 --> 01:45:13.792
Charging.

01:45:13.875 --> 01:45:15.750
(beeping)

01:45:18.917 --> 01:45:19.792
(long beep)

01:45:19.875 --> 01:45:21.291
-Come on, baby. Come on, baby.
-Clear.

01:45:21.375 --> 01:45:22.583
Clear!

01:45:25.709 --> 01:45:26.709
Get out of here.

01:45:34.208 --> 01:45:37.792
Come on, breathe, baby.
Goddamn it, breathe!

01:45:37.875 --> 01:45:38.834
Goddamn it, you bitch,

01:45:38.917 --> 01:45:40.792
you never backed away
from anything in your life!

01:45:40.875 --> 01:45:41.834
Now fight!

01:45:41.917 --> 01:45:43.834
Fight! Fight!

01:45:43.917 --> 01:45:45.458
Right now!
Do it!

01:45:46.375 --> 01:45:47.709
Fight, goddamn it!

01:45:49.750 --> 01:45:50.709
Fight!

01:45:50.792 --> 01:45:51.792
Fight!

01:45:51.875 --> 01:45:53.333
Fight!

01:45:53.417 --> 01:45:54.667
(inhales)

01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:57.041
BUD: Fight!

01:46:02.083 --> 01:46:04.500
Lindsey.
That's it, Lindsey.

01:46:04.583 --> 01:46:06.375
That's it, Linds.
You can do it.

01:46:06.458 --> 01:46:08.375
That's it, Linds.
Come on back, baby.

01:46:08.458 --> 01:46:10.375
Come on.
You can do it, baby.

01:46:10.458 --> 01:46:13.625
(gasps then coughs)

01:46:21.750 --> 01:46:22.959
Get her some air.

01:46:24.291 --> 01:46:25.792
Easy. Breathe easy.

01:46:26.750 --> 01:46:28.458
All right.
All right.

01:46:29.834 --> 01:46:31.166
You did it, ace!

01:46:37.125 --> 01:46:38.959
Yeah! Yeah!

01:46:41.291 --> 01:46:43.542
You did it, baby.

01:46:43.625 --> 01:46:45.917
She's breathing.
She's breathing.

01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:47.500
Make sure
her heart's okay.

01:46:47.583 --> 01:46:49.417
Make sure her heart's
doing okay.

01:47:06.667 --> 01:47:08.458
Big boys don't cry,
remember?

01:47:15.041 --> 01:47:16.166
Hi, lady.

01:47:18.333 --> 01:47:19.667
Hi, tough guy.

01:47:23.709 --> 01:47:25.250
I guess it worked,
didn't it?

01:47:25.333 --> 01:47:27.208
Yeah,
of course it did.

01:47:29.208 --> 01:47:30.625
You're never wrong,
are you?

01:47:33.542 --> 01:47:35.667
How you feeling, huh?

01:47:36.834 --> 01:47:38.125
I've felt better.

01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:41.041
What did
you do to me?

01:47:47.834 --> 01:47:49.500
Next time,
it's your turn, okay?

01:47:50.417 --> 01:47:51.375
Yeah.

01:47:52.583 --> 01:47:54.375
Yeah, you got
that right.

01:47:56.208 --> 01:47:57.917
MAN: Okay. These are so
your eyes can focus

01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:59.625
in the breathing fluid.

01:47:59.709 --> 01:48:02.000
How's that feel?
There it is.

01:48:02.083 --> 01:48:04.458
If you can't see, you can't
disarm the bomb, right?

01:48:04.542 --> 01:48:06.458
Okay, with this
much weight,

01:48:06.542 --> 01:48:07.917
you're going to fall
like a brick.

01:48:09.083 --> 01:48:10.458
We've still got
about an hour,

01:48:10.542 --> 01:48:12.083
so you should get there
in plenty of time.

01:48:13.375 --> 01:48:14.917
When you get down there,
all you got to do is

01:48:15.000 --> 01:48:16.291
cut one wire,
drop the weights,

01:48:16.375 --> 01:48:17.875
and come on home.

01:48:21.375 --> 01:48:22.792
Hand me that wrench
over there, will you?

01:48:22.875 --> 01:48:24.041
Maybe I ought
to check and see.

01:48:25.166 --> 01:48:26.041
Yeah, that's
a good place.

01:48:27.125 --> 01:48:28.125
There.

01:48:28.208 --> 01:48:30.083
That's loose.
I'll fix that up.

01:48:31.417 --> 01:48:34.083
Bud, you don't have
to do this.

01:48:35.583 --> 01:48:37.375
Somebody's got
to do it.

01:48:37.458 --> 01:48:39.083
It doesn't have
to be you.

01:48:39.917 --> 01:48:40.917
Who, then?

01:48:45.917 --> 01:48:47.667
So I can hear you,

01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:49.834
but I can't talk,
right?

01:48:49.917 --> 01:48:52.542
The fluid prevents the larynx
from making sound. Excuse me.

01:48:52.625 --> 01:48:54.000
You'll feel
a little strange.

01:48:54.083 --> 01:48:55.667
Yeah? No shit.

01:48:55.750 --> 01:48:57.667
I got to warn
you all,

01:48:57.750 --> 01:48:59.625
I'm a pretty
lousy typist.

01:48:59.709 --> 01:49:00.875
(chuckles)

01:49:03.542 --> 01:49:04.917
Moment of truth.

01:49:06.542 --> 01:49:07.333
Come on,
let's go.

01:49:07.417 --> 01:49:08.208
Let's go.

01:49:08.291 --> 01:49:10.083
Careful. Easy.

01:49:13.625 --> 01:49:14.875
In the front,
clamp it.

01:49:14.959 --> 01:49:15.917
-Okay.
-Thank you.

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000
Got it.

01:49:18.625 --> 01:49:19.417
Set.

01:49:19.500 --> 01:49:20.583
MAN: Set. Clamp?

01:49:20.667 --> 01:49:21.917
Set.

01:49:31.917 --> 01:49:33.417
Okay. Let's rock 'n' roll.

01:49:35.792 --> 01:49:36.834
Crack it.

01:49:37.667 --> 01:49:39.083
Headset.
Headset, please.

01:49:41.125 --> 01:49:42.166
Okay.

01:49:42.250 --> 01:49:44.834
Relax now, Bud.
Just relax.

01:49:44.917 --> 01:49:45.667
Bud.

01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:47.834
-MAN: Relax now, Bud.
-Watch me.

01:49:47.917 --> 01:49:49.834
-LINDSEY: Okay. Watch me.
-MAN: Relax.

01:49:49.917 --> 01:49:51.625
-LINDSEY: Watch me.
-MAN: Okay. Doing fine.

01:49:51.709 --> 01:49:52.750
Now, don't hold your breath.
Take it in.

01:49:52.834 --> 01:49:55.041
Just let yourself
take it in.

01:49:55.125 --> 01:49:58.208
Take it in. That's it.

01:49:58.291 --> 01:49:59.917
-CATFISH: Oh, man.
-MAN: Don't hold
your breath now.

01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.583
Take it in.
There you go.

01:50:01.667 --> 01:50:02.917
Don't hold your breath.

01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.500
Take it in. That's it.
There you go.

01:50:05.291 --> 01:50:06.291
Bud!

01:50:06.375 --> 01:50:08.291
This is not normal!

01:50:08.375 --> 01:50:10.458
This is normal!
It'll pass in a second.

01:50:10.542 --> 01:50:11.875
It's perfectly normal.

01:50:11.959 --> 01:50:14.625
-This is normal?
-Perfectly normal.

01:50:14.709 --> 01:50:16.417
We all breathed liquid
for nine months, Bud.

01:50:16.500 --> 01:50:17.875
Your body will remember.

01:50:17.959 --> 01:50:18.750
That's it.

01:50:18.834 --> 01:50:20.000
That's it.

01:50:21.375 --> 01:50:22.792
Perfectly normal.

01:50:22.875 --> 01:50:24.417
CATFISH: Christ,
he's breathing.

01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:25.542
Give me that.

01:50:27.166 --> 01:50:28.041
Can you hear me?

01:50:28.125 --> 01:50:29.583
There he goes.

01:50:29.667 --> 01:50:31.583
-Yes? Yes, okay.
-He's got it. That's it.

01:50:31.667 --> 01:50:34.041
Bud, try your keypad.

01:50:44.709 --> 01:50:45.834
(chuckles)

01:50:45.917 --> 01:50:47.417
MAN: Right.

01:50:49.917 --> 01:50:51.041
I already have.

01:50:54.917 --> 01:50:55.917
-LINDSEY: Okay.
-Great.

01:50:56.000 --> 01:50:57.667
Let's go.

01:50:57.750 --> 01:50:58.667
Okay.

01:50:58.750 --> 01:51:00.000
That's okay.
I got it.

01:51:01.375 --> 01:51:02.375
I got it.

01:51:03.542 --> 01:51:05.291
MAN: Okay, Hippy.
You done yet?

01:51:05.375 --> 01:51:07.000
-LINDSEY: Hold on, Jammer.
-CATFISH: Okay, Bud.

01:51:07.083 --> 01:51:09.000
Easy. Easy.
Watch out.

01:51:09.083 --> 01:51:11.000
Watch the side.
Watch the back.

01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:13.875
LINDSEY:
Careful.

01:51:16.125 --> 01:51:18.667
I rigged in
Little Geek's chip,

01:51:18.750 --> 01:51:20.166
the same as Big Geek!

01:51:20.250 --> 01:51:22.333
It should take you
straight there!

01:51:22.417 --> 01:51:24.750
All you have to do
is hang on!

01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:13.250
What's his depth?

01:53:13.333 --> 01:53:14.875
3,200 feet.

01:53:14.959 --> 01:53:16.291
Your depth
is 3,200 feet.

01:53:16.375 --> 01:53:18.458
You're doing fine.

01:53:18.542 --> 01:53:20.458
You better watch out
for crane wreckage.

01:53:20.542 --> 01:53:21.750
You should be almost to it.

01:53:33.583 --> 01:53:35.125
4,800 feet.
It's official.

01:53:35.208 --> 01:53:37.083
Yeah.

01:53:37.166 --> 01:53:38.500
Bud, according
to Monk here,

01:53:38.583 --> 01:53:39.750
you just set a record

01:53:39.834 --> 01:53:41.125
for the deepest
suit dive.

01:53:41.208 --> 01:53:43.291
Bet you didn't think
you'd be doing this

01:53:43.375 --> 01:53:45.041
when you got up
this morning, huh?

01:53:53.834 --> 01:53:56.333
One mile down.
Still grinning.

01:54:12.583 --> 01:54:14.250
8,500 feet.

01:54:16.917 --> 01:54:18.041
8,500 feet, Bud.

01:54:18.125 --> 01:54:19.417
Everything okay?

01:54:22.458 --> 01:54:23.667
Ask him about
pressure effects--

01:54:23.750 --> 01:54:25.750
tremors,
vision problems, euphoria.

01:54:28.291 --> 01:54:30.083
Ensign Monk wants to know
how you feel.

01:54:42.458 --> 01:54:45.417
It's starting. It hits
the nervous system first.

01:54:45.500 --> 01:54:47.667
Keep talking, Lindsey.
Let him hear your voice.

01:54:47.750 --> 01:54:50.250
Okay, Bud. Your depth
is 8,900 feet.

01:54:50.333 --> 01:54:51.250
You're doing fine.

01:54:51.333 --> 01:54:52.959
No, Lindsey.

01:54:54.000 --> 01:54:55.125
Talk to him.

01:55:02.959 --> 01:55:05.750
Bud...
there are some...

01:55:07.125 --> 01:55:08.500
some things
I need to say.

01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:11.667
It's hard for me,
you know.

01:55:14.083 --> 01:55:17.083
It's not easy being
a cast-iron bitch.

01:55:17.166 --> 01:55:19.458
It takes discipline
and years of training.

01:55:21.583 --> 01:55:22.917
A lot of people
don't appreciate that.

01:55:26.834 --> 01:55:27.792
Jesus, I'm sorry

01:55:27.875 --> 01:55:29.500
I can't tell you these
things to your face.

01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:32.250
I have to wait
till you're

01:55:32.333 --> 01:55:34.250
alone in the dark,

01:55:34.333 --> 01:55:37.250
freezing, and there's 10,000
feet of water between us.

01:55:37.333 --> 01:55:39.500
Coming up
on the big ten thou.

01:55:43.333 --> 01:55:45.333
(glass cracks and shatters)

01:55:47.166 --> 01:55:48.291
12,000 feet.

01:55:48.375 --> 01:55:49.583
Jesus, I don't believe
he's doing this.

01:55:49.667 --> 01:55:51.583
Please. Shut up.

01:55:51.667 --> 01:55:53.000
What's wrong with you?

01:55:53.625 --> 01:55:55.000
(exhales)

01:55:57.458 --> 01:55:58.875
Bud, how are you doing?

01:56:05.208 --> 01:56:06.083
Bud?

01:56:09.542 --> 01:56:10.792
He's losing it.

01:56:10.875 --> 01:56:12.625
Talk to him.
Keep him with us.

01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:14.500
HIPPY:
Coming up on 16,000.

01:56:14.583 --> 01:56:16.834
No, B-Bud,
it's the pressure, all right?

01:56:16.917 --> 01:56:18.125
You have to listen
to my voice.

01:56:18.208 --> 01:56:19.291
You have to try.

01:56:19.375 --> 01:56:21.125
Concentrate, all right?

01:56:21.208 --> 01:56:23.792
Just listen to
my voice, please.

01:56:23.875 --> 01:56:26.333
17,000 feet.

01:56:26.417 --> 01:56:28.750
Christ almighty,
this is insane.

01:56:28.834 --> 01:56:31.083
Bud? I'm not
getting anything.

01:56:35.417 --> 01:56:37.291
(glass shatters)

01:56:37.375 --> 01:56:39.291
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Oh, come on! No, no!
-LINDSEY: What?

01:56:39.375 --> 01:56:41.000
Little Geek just folded.

01:56:41.083 --> 01:56:42.250
Jesus!

01:57:32.834 --> 01:57:34.500
He can still
make it.

01:57:40.083 --> 01:57:41.125
Bud...

01:57:42.625 --> 01:57:44.083
I know how
alone you feel...

01:57:46.667 --> 01:57:50.291
alone in all that
cold blackness.

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:56.375
But I'm there
in the dark with you.

01:57:56.458 --> 01:57:58.166
Oh, Bud,
you're not alone!

01:58:03.291 --> 01:58:04.333
I'm with you.

01:58:05.625 --> 01:58:07.208
I'll always be
with you, Bud.

01:58:07.291 --> 01:58:08.166
I promise that.

01:58:22.125 --> 01:58:23.375
How you doing,
partner?

01:58:25.333 --> 01:58:26.875
You still with us?
Come back.

01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:30.750
You talk to us,
buddy boy.

01:58:30.834 --> 01:58:31.750
Come on.

01:58:31.834 --> 01:58:34.792
Bud. Talk to me, Bud.

01:58:34.875 --> 01:58:36.333
Now, come on.
You hanging in there?

01:58:37.667 --> 01:58:39.458
Just-- You have
to talk to me, Bud.

01:58:39.542 --> 01:58:42.375
Please. I need to know
if you're okay.

01:58:49.709 --> 01:58:51.458
(sighs)

01:58:57.500 --> 01:58:59.583
LINDSEY: You see--
You see a light.

01:58:59.667 --> 01:59:01.208
What kind of light, Bud?

01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:05.041
He's hallucinating badly.

01:59:28.750 --> 01:59:30.166
-MAN: He made it.
-Oh, my God.

01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:31.875
Oh, man.

01:59:33.917 --> 01:59:35.125
Okay, Bud.

01:59:35.917 --> 01:59:38.208
We'll go
step by step.

01:59:38.291 --> 01:59:41.000
Remove the detonator housing

01:59:41.083 --> 01:59:43.959
by unscrewing it
counterclockwise.

02:00:15.125 --> 02:00:17.083
All right, Bud.

02:00:17.166 --> 02:00:19.166
You have to cut
the ground wire,

02:00:19.250 --> 02:00:20.333
not the lead wire.

02:00:21.792 --> 02:00:24.250
It's the blue wire
with the white stripe.

02:00:24.333 --> 02:00:26.500
Not, I repeat,

02:00:26.583 --> 02:00:29.750
not the black wire
with the yellow stripe.

02:01:24.166 --> 02:01:26.083
(laughing)

02:01:26.166 --> 02:01:27.583
Yes!

02:01:27.667 --> 02:01:28.959
Quiet! Quiet!
Save your air!

02:01:29.041 --> 02:01:31.792
Bud, give me a reading
off your liquid oxygen gauge.

02:01:39.333 --> 02:01:40.333
What?

02:01:41.875 --> 02:01:43.792
It took him 30 minutes
just to get down there!

02:01:43.875 --> 02:01:45.500
Bud, do you hear me?

02:01:45.583 --> 02:01:47.583
You drop your weights
and start back now, Bud!

02:01:47.667 --> 02:01:49.583
That gauge
could be wrong!

02:01:49.667 --> 02:01:50.625
Do you hear me?

02:01:50.709 --> 02:01:53.458
Just drop your weights
and start back now.

02:01:53.542 --> 02:01:55.417
Your gauge
could be wrong!

02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:56.750
Your gauge
could be wrong!

02:01:56.834 --> 02:01:59.208
You drop your weights
and start back now!

02:02:03.208 --> 02:02:04.959
No, you won't stay there!
Do you hear me?

02:02:05.041 --> 02:02:06.166
You drop your weights.

02:02:06.250 --> 02:02:08.834
You can breathe shallow.
Do you hear me?

02:02:08.917 --> 02:02:11.000
Bud, please!
Listen to me, please!

02:02:11.083 --> 02:02:14.125
Goddamn it, you dragged me back

02:02:14.208 --> 02:02:16.834
You can't leave me here
alone now, please.

02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.125
Oh, God, Virgil, please.

02:02:20.208 --> 02:02:21.709
Please.

02:03:03.625 --> 02:03:05.000
I love you.

02:07:17.709 --> 02:07:24.667
(gasps deeply)

02:08:03.750 --> 02:08:06.041
(coughs)

02:08:11.542 --> 02:08:12.542
Howdy.

02:08:13.375 --> 02:08:16.291
Uh...how you guys doing?

02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:36.583
MAN (over radio):
Deep Core, do you read?

02:09:36.667 --> 02:09:38.375
This is Benthic Explorer. Over.

02:09:38.458 --> 02:09:39.875
Do you hear,
Deep Core?

02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:42.917
Deep Core,
do you read?

02:09:43.000 --> 02:09:44.333
Do you read me,
Deep Core?

02:09:47.166 --> 02:09:48.417
Deep Core,
do you read?

02:09:48.500 --> 02:09:50.166
This is Benthic Explorer. Over.

02:09:53.166 --> 02:09:54.875
Hell, yes! We read.
Good of you to join us.

02:09:54.959 --> 02:09:56.083
Copy, Deep Core.

02:09:56.166 --> 02:09:58.041
Hey, I've got them!

02:09:58.125 --> 02:09:59.917
CATFISH: How's that storm
going up there?

02:10:00.041 --> 02:10:01.625
Well, it's strange.
It just sort of blew itself out

02:10:01.709 --> 02:10:02.917
all of a sudden.

02:10:03.000 --> 02:10:03.959
Well, hell, son,

02:10:04.041 --> 02:10:05.291
you'd better get
a line down to us.

02:10:05.375 --> 02:10:07.625
We're in moderately
poor shape down here.

02:10:07.709 --> 02:10:10.458
We lost seven people,
including Bud,

02:10:10.542 --> 02:10:11.834
and we're about out
of O2,

02:10:11.917 --> 02:10:13.166
so whatever
you're gonna do,

02:10:13.250 --> 02:10:14.542
you better do it fast.

02:10:16.417 --> 02:10:17.250
CATFISH: You boys make up
your mind

02:10:17.333 --> 02:10:18.834
how to get us
out of here yet?

02:10:18.917 --> 02:10:21.458
They're talking about flying in
a DSRV from Norfolk.

02:10:21.542 --> 02:10:24.583
-Right?
-It'll come in
to Guantanamo on a C-133.

02:10:24.667 --> 02:10:25.834
MAN: Okay, okay,
I understand that,

02:10:25.917 --> 02:10:27.125
but how long is
that going to take?

02:10:27.208 --> 02:10:28.667
Hey.

02:10:28.750 --> 02:10:30.709
Hey.
Hey! It's Bud!

02:10:31.583 --> 02:10:32.917
MAN: That's impossible.

02:10:35.000 --> 02:10:36.333
No, it's not.

Do you hear, Deep Core?

02:10:37.375 --> 02:10:38.667
Yes!

02:10:38.750 --> 02:10:40.291
Deep Core, do you read?
Do you read--

02:10:40.375 --> 02:10:42.667
Wa-Wait. We got
a message from Bud.

02:10:42.750 --> 02:10:44.333
Bud?

02:10:44.417 --> 02:10:45.625
What's it say?

02:10:45.709 --> 02:10:47.250
Uh, here.

02:10:49.417 --> 02:10:52.709
Oh, God. It says,
"Virgil Brigman back
on the air."

02:10:52.792 --> 02:10:54.250
HIPPY: Yes!

02:11:03.583 --> 02:11:06.083
"Have some new friends
down here."

02:11:10.792 --> 02:11:13.041
(rumbling)

02:11:15.750 --> 02:11:17.000
What the hell's
going on?

02:11:17.083 --> 02:11:19.542
One Night,
get to sonar.

02:11:19.625 --> 02:11:21.250
Good God almighty.

02:11:23.291 --> 02:11:26.709
Fellas...I'm getting some
awful big readings here.

02:11:26.792 --> 02:11:28.542
Something's coming
up the wall.

02:11:28.625 --> 02:11:30.625
-What is it?
-Whatever it is,
it's major!

02:11:51.959 --> 02:11:53.959
Something's definitely
going on down there.

02:11:55.834 --> 02:11:58.875
Active is pinging back
something really big.

02:11:58.959 --> 02:12:00.875
It's huge, and it's coming up
right underneath us.

02:12:00.959 --> 02:12:02.041
Where?

02:12:02.125 --> 02:12:04.041
Where?
It's everywhere.

02:12:04.125 --> 02:12:05.625
There! Starboard bow.

02:12:09.875 --> 02:12:11.333
