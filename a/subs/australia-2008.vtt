<i>My grandfather, King George-</i>

<i>he take'em me walkabout...</i>

<i>That day I down the billabong.</i>

<i>King George-he teach me how</i>
<i>to catch'em fish using magic song.</i>

02:13.013 --> 02:17.040
<i>See, I not blackfella.</i>
<i>I not white fella either.</i>

02:17.117 --> 02:19.608
<i>Them white fellas call me mixed-blood...</i>

02:21.121 --> 02:23.419
- <i>half-caste-</i>
- Yea!

02:23.490 --> 02:25.958
<i>creamy.</i>

02:26.026 --> 02:28.961
- <i>Hyah!</i>
- <i>I belong no one.</i>

02:29.029 --> 02:32.055
<i>That day I see'em them white fellas.</i>

02:32.132 --> 02:34.828
<i>They were pushing</i>
<i>them cheeky bulls across the river...</i>

02:34.902 --> 02:37.803
<i>onto Carney land.</i>

02:42.142 --> 02:45.908
<i>King George angry at them white fellas.</i>

02:47.414 --> 02:51.976
<i>King George say</i>
<i>them white fella bad spirit.</i>

02:52.052 --> 02:54.680
<i>Must be taken from this land.</i>

03:20.681 --> 03:22.342
<i>Shh.</i>

04:13.400 --> 04:15.391
Coppers.

04:15.469 --> 04:17.266
<i>Them coppers come take me away.</i>

04:17.338 --> 04:20.238
<i>They want to put me</i>
<i>on that Mission Island.</i>

04:21.809 --> 04:24.937
<i>Make me into a white fella.</i>

04:27.481 --> 04:30.006
<i>But they're not coppers.</i>

04:31.352 --> 04:33.877
Whoa there. Whoa. Whoa.

04:36.990 --> 04:40.448
<i>And that first time I saw her-</i>

04:40.527 --> 04:42.518
<i>that Mrs. Boss.</i>

04:42.596 --> 04:46.532
<i>The strangest woman I ever seen.</i>

04:46.600 --> 04:48.864
<i>She's not from this land.</i>

04:52.906 --> 04:57.104
<i>This land my people</i>
<i>got many names for...</i>

04:57.177 --> 04:59.168
<i>but white fellas call it...</i>

05:00.948 --> 05:02.939
<i>Australia.</i>

05:05.486 --> 05:07.852
<i>But this story not begin that day.</i>

05:07.921 --> 05:13.291
<i>This story begin a little while ago</i>
<i>in a land far, far away.</i>

05:13.360 --> 05:16.557
<i>That land called England.</i>

05:22.403 --> 05:25.429
My husband must sell Faraway Downs.

05:25.506 --> 05:28.907
<i>But the offer from</i>
<i>this "Cattle King,"Mr. Carney...</i>

05:28.976 --> 05:31.308
is only one-sixth
of what it was once worth.

05:31.378 --> 05:33.312
We need the money, Ramsden.

05:33.380 --> 05:35.905
But Maitland
is just about to muster the fats.

05:35.983 --> 05:37.280
What?

05:37.351 --> 05:39.319
Get the-the big cows ready for market.

05:39.386 --> 05:41.320
<i>Ramsden, you and I both know...</i>

05:41.388 --> 05:45.552
there is only one reason my husband
has spent so much time down under...

05:45.626 --> 05:48.254
and it has absolutely nothing
to do with cows.

05:48.328 --> 05:51.195
At least not of the animal variety.

05:51.265 --> 05:53.460
Lady Ashley,
I-I do think that's a bit harsh.

05:53.534 --> 05:56.594
- Oh, Ramsden, drink your tea.
- Lady Ashley!

05:56.670 --> 05:59.503
<i>What do you intend to do?</i>

05:59.573 --> 06:01.768
I intend to travel
to this cattle station...

06:01.842 --> 06:03.537
sell it...

06:03.610 --> 06:06.135
and bring Maitland home myself!

06:06.213 --> 06:09.705
<i>But, Lady Ashley, it's Australia.</i>

06:10.017 --> 06:13.680
<i>Darling Sarah, I implore you, do not travel.</i>

06:13.754 --> 06:15.813
<i>Outbreak of war imminent. Stop.</i>

06:15.889 --> 06:19.689
<i> Maitland, your concern</i>
<i>regarding war duly noted. Stop.</i>

06:19.760 --> 06:21.728
<i>Have plan concerning cattle.</i>

06:21.795 --> 06:24.229
<i>Sale to King Carney not necessary.</i>

06:24.298 --> 06:27.790
- <i>Need more time. Stop.</i>
- <i> Nonsense. Stop.</i>

06:27.868 --> 06:32.237
<i>Expect contract for sale of station</i>
<i>to be drawn by time of my arrival. Stop.</i>

06:32.306 --> 06:35.469
<i>Cannot meet you. Stop.
Am mustering. Stop.</i>

06:35.542 --> 06:38.909
<i>Have sent trusted man. Stop.</i>
<i>The Drover. Stop.</i>

06:40.647 --> 06:42.638
The Drover?

06:52.926 --> 06:56.726
<i>Drover, you boong lover.</i>

07:01.435 --> 07:03.699
Any of you other Carney boys
want to have a go?

07:08.509 --> 07:12.605
Come on, fellas.
Don't let fear stand in your way.

07:13.747 --> 07:15.112
I'll have ya.

07:16.617 --> 07:19.450
Hey! No boongs in here!

07:19.520 --> 07:22.887
He's not in the pub, Ivan.

07:24.791 --> 07:27.692
<i> Go on.</i>

07:27.761 --> 07:32.198
<i>Run after your boong friend, 'cause as far</i>
<i>as this town's concerned, you</i> are <i>a black.</i>

07:32.266 --> 07:34.700
You work with them,
you eat with them...

07:34.768 --> 07:36.702
and you sleep with them.

07:36.770 --> 07:38.738
Oh, crikey.

07:45.012 --> 07:46.741
When you see her, wave your hat.

07:54.655 --> 07:57.021
What are you waiting for, an invitation?

07:58.525 --> 08:00.516
I hate coming to town.

08:03.564 --> 08:06.226
Lady Sarah Ashley.

08:06.300 --> 08:10.134
A genuine aristocrat
living right here in Darwin.

08:10.203 --> 08:11.966
Administrator, we're at war.

08:12.039 --> 08:13.506
Oh.

08:13.574 --> 08:15.439
<i>As the officer...</i>

08:15.509 --> 08:18.171
<i>in charge of livestock purchases</i>
<i>for the armed forces-</i>

08:18.245 --> 08:21.408
- She's quite a looker.
- <i>I fail to see...</i>

08:21.481 --> 08:24.348
what Lady Sarah Ashley...

08:24.418 --> 08:28.445
<i>has to do with Carney's stranglehold</i>
<i>of the beef industry.</i>

08:28.522 --> 08:30.820
<i>Her husband, Lord Ashley...</i>

08:30.891 --> 08:33.985
claims he's mustering fats
at Faraway Downs.

08:34.061 --> 08:36.029
- <i>Faraway Downs?</i>
- Faraway Downs.

08:36.096 --> 08:39.121
The only cattle station
in the whole of the north...

08:39.198 --> 08:42.794
not owned by Leslie "King" Carney.

08:42.869 --> 08:45.705
- Lord Maitland Ashley
is mustering on Faraway Downs?

08:45.706 --> 08:46.965
<i> Yeah, yeah.</i>

08:47.040 --> 08:50.635
- Isn't quite what we had in mind, is it, Neil?
- <i>No. Yeah.</i>

08:50.711 --> 08:53.305
And now his missus has arrived
on the flying boat.

08:53.380 --> 08:57.214
<i>Doesn't look like they're gonna sell</i>
<i>Faraway Downs to me, Neil.</i>

08:57.284 --> 08:59.218
Ah, she won't last.

08:59.286 --> 09:03.222
A delicate English rose withers
in the outback. Hmm.

09:03.290 --> 09:04.621
You with me?

09:04.691 --> 09:07.023
If you must know, I am to be met-

09:07.094 --> 09:10.154
by my husband's trusted man,
a Mr. Drover.

09:10.230 --> 09:11.663
The bloody Drover?

09:15.035 --> 09:17.663
Bring it. Yes.

09:17.738 --> 09:20.229
Move it.

09:20.307 --> 09:24.505
Look at my wife and daughter down there
giving her the royal welcome.

09:24.578 --> 09:27.877
My fiancÃ©, Neil Fletcher,
manages Faraway Downs.

09:29.082 --> 09:31.073
Good day.

09:32.786 --> 09:35.311
A bit pale.

09:35.389 --> 09:38.483
Not a bad-looking sheila,
but what's the story on the luggage?

09:38.558 --> 09:41.391
Wants to settle down
in the outback, does she?

09:41.461 --> 09:46.398
<i>If she stays and Lord Ashley manages to</i>
<i>get his cattle down onto that wharfthere...</i>

09:46.466 --> 09:49.697
<i>then we've got a competitor</i>
<i>for the army contract, Neil.</i>

09:49.770 --> 09:53.934
<i>Carney's control of every</i>
<i>cattle station in the north...</i>

09:54.007 --> 09:57.909
jeopardizes the supply of <i>beef</i>
to our troops.

09:57.978 --> 10:01.675
But it's a poor war that doesn't make
a decent patriot rich, so...

10:01.748 --> 10:05.115
<i>I don't want a single beast</i>
<i>from Faraway Downs...</i>

10:05.185 --> 10:08.677
to set a hoof on that wharf.

10:10.490 --> 10:15.393
- You with me, Neil?
- Yeah, yeah. Nature will take its course.

10:19.433 --> 10:21.094
<i>What about the missus?</i>

10:21.168 --> 10:24.103
No, I've arranged for someone special
to give her the old scenic route.

10:26.707 --> 10:28.402
Give her a taste of the outback.

10:28.475 --> 10:30.534
No!

10:32.813 --> 10:35.373
- <i> Who's taking her?</i>
- The Drover.

10:39.886 --> 10:41.820
The Drover?

10:41.888 --> 10:45.824
<i>Enjoy the ride, sweetheart.</i>

10:51.998 --> 10:54.296
I'm Sarah Ashley.

10:57.871 --> 10:59.839
My husband, Lord Ashley...

10:59.906 --> 11:02.272
has sent a trusted man to collect me.

11:02.342 --> 11:03.775
<i>A, uh-A Mr. Drover.</i>

11:05.746 --> 11:08.772
It seems as if he has been waylaid.

11:10.817 --> 11:12.512
No women.

11:12.586 --> 11:14.110
Ladies' lounge next door.

11:14.187 --> 11:17.645
<i>The hen parlor's thataway, my dear.</i>

11:17.724 --> 11:19.692
No wonder your establishment is empty.

11:22.596 --> 11:24.689
Good day.

11:27.601 --> 11:29.865
Oh! Oh!

11:31.204 --> 11:33.104
You can take him!

11:37.444 --> 11:39.605
No!

11:59.766 --> 12:01.734
Oh! No, no!

12:01.802 --> 12:04.896
<i>No, not my bags. Not my-</i>

12:04.971 --> 12:07.963
<i>Oh, no, no!</i>

12:14.047 --> 12:16.607
<i>Here.</i>

12:16.683 --> 12:18.617
Welcome to Australia.

12:22.722 --> 12:25.190
<i>Drover take Mrs. Boss to Faraway Downs...</i>

12:25.258 --> 12:27.556
<i>in a great, big, fancy truck.</i>

12:28.628 --> 12:31.859
<i>He even let her sit in his special seat.</i>

12:31.932 --> 12:35.891
<i>She even drinks</i>
<i>Drover's own water bottle.</i>

12:35.969 --> 12:37.163
<i>That's it.</i>

12:37.237 --> 12:39.865
<i>They get along like a burnin' house.</i>

12:39.940 --> 12:41.931
<i>Now, Magarri-he sit'em up top.</i>

12:42.008 --> 12:45.000
<i>And Magarri's cousin Goolajbaloong-</i>

12:45.078 --> 12:47.046
<i>he come along for the ride.</i>

12:47.113 --> 12:49.581
- Oh!
- <i>They make'em friends right away.</i>

12:49.649 --> 12:51.241
Water.

12:51.318 --> 12:52.512
Oh.

12:52.586 --> 12:55.453
That's it. That's it. Stay, Jedda. Stay.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.690
"Trusted man."
Typical of my husband.

13:02.762 --> 13:04.696
Actually, your husband's
a pretty good bloke.

13:04.764 --> 13:07.062
Yes, well, he certainly knows
how to choose his employees.

13:07.133 --> 13:10.125
- Employee?
- Mmm. No wonder the place is bankrupt.

13:10.203 --> 13:12.228
- Lady, I'm not an employee.
- <i> Really?</i>

13:12.305 --> 13:15.297
So you're just driving me
all the way out to Faraway Downs...

13:15.375 --> 13:17.536
- as a personal favor to my husband, are you?
- No.

13:17.611 --> 13:19.704
Him being
such a good bloke and all, hmm?

13:19.779 --> 13:23.078
I'm driving you out there because he
promised me a drove of 1,500 head of cattle.

13:23.149 --> 13:25.208
- What, to buy?
- No, you goose. To drove.

13:25.630 --> 13:28.482
I'm a drover, right? I move
the cattle from "A" to "B."

13:28.555 --> 13:31.991
<i>All right? I work on commission.</i>
<i>No man hires me, no man fires me.</i>

13:32.058 --> 13:33.457
- Oh-
- Everything I own...

13:33.526 --> 13:36.393
I can fit in my saddlebag,
which is the way I like it.

13:36.463 --> 13:41.264
Oh! Yes, well, it's all-
all very "outback adventure," isn't it?

13:41.334 --> 13:43.564
- I'm not saying it's for everyone.
- No.

13:43.637 --> 13:45.901
Definitely not for everyone.

13:45.972 --> 13:48.907
Most people like to own things.
You know, land, luggage, other people.

13:48.975 --> 13:52.911
<i>Makes them feel secure.</i>
<i>But all that can be taken away.</i>

13:52.979 --> 13:56.415
And in the end, the only thing
you really own is, uh-

13:56.483 --> 13:58.610
is your story.

13:58.685 --> 14:00.676
Just tryin' to live a good one.

14:00.754 --> 14:04.212
Yes, yes. An adventure story.
Mmm. You sound just like my husband.

14:06.559 --> 14:09.153
Oh!

14:09.229 --> 14:11.459
Oh, they're kangaroos!

14:11.531 --> 14:13.761
- <i>Big reds.</i>
- Oh! Lovely.

14:13.833 --> 14:16.199
- <i>Beautiful.</i>
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Beautiful.

14:16.269 --> 14:18.294
<i> I've never seen a kangaroo.</i>
<i>Beautiful, jumping.</i>

14:18.371 --> 14:20.362
- <i> Yeah, they're jumping.</i>
- Oh!

14:20.440 --> 14:22.931
Oh, it's beautiful.

14:23.009 --> 14:26.342
- <i>Uh-</i>
- Oh! Look at them jumping!

14:36.790 --> 14:39.554
Ah!

15:10.590 --> 15:13.184
Mr. Drover.

15:13.259 --> 15:14.851
Hey, Miss Boss.

15:14.928 --> 15:16.361
Tucker, Mrs. Boss?

15:16.429 --> 15:18.727
- Mr. Drover.
- Yeah?

15:18.798 --> 15:21.198
- There's only one tent.
- That's right.

15:21.267 --> 15:22.079
For the four of us?

15:22.080 --> 15:24.430
Well, you know, it gets
pretty chilly here at night.

15:24.504 --> 15:27.871
We, uh-We like to bunk up together,
eh, Magarri? Goolaj, huh?

15:27.941 --> 15:30.239
Nice and close, you know.

15:35.849 --> 15:36.838
Oh!

15:36.916 --> 15:38.907
Oh, come on, Lady Ashley.

15:38.985 --> 15:41.044
We're just having a laugh.

15:41.121 --> 15:45.114
Never really slept in a tent in our life.
We just bunk around the fire, you see?

15:45.191 --> 15:48.217
- See, we're not really used to, um-
- A woman?

15:48.294 --> 15:51.525
<i>I suppose you think I should be</i>
<i>back in Darwin at the church fete...</i>

15:51.598 --> 15:53.759
<i>or the ladies'. uh, whatever you call it.</i>

15:53.833 --> 15:56.427
Well, I will have you know
that I am as capable as any man.

15:59.806 --> 16:02.934
Guests. We're not used to guests.
That's what I was about to say.

16:03.009 --> 16:06.103
But now you mention it, I happen to
quite like the women of the outback.

16:06.179 --> 16:08.909
But they're mostly native women.

16:08.982 --> 16:10.472
Aboriginal women.

16:10.550 --> 16:13.644
<i>They're very easy to, uh-</i>

16:13.720 --> 16:16.154
to get along with, if you try.

16:16.222 --> 16:18.816
<i># Whoa, babe</i>
<i>something is bothering me #</i>

16:19.125 --> 16:22.151
Go!

16:22.228 --> 16:24.389
- <i>Ho!</i>
- Him always punctual.

16:28.201 --> 16:31.432
Get out of here!

16:31.504 --> 16:34.371
- <i> What's that?</i>
- Your accountant.

16:34.441 --> 16:38.343
<i> Hey, Drover!</i>
<i>He's your bloody problem now!</i>

16:38.411 --> 16:40.402
<i>See you, Drover!</i>

16:44.884 --> 16:47.978
Kippelly Flymm.

16:48.054 --> 16:51.455
- Kippelly Flynn.
- I'm sorry. What was your name again?

16:51.524 --> 16:55.688
Lipelling Klymm, mi- mila- milady.

16:55.762 --> 16:57.821
Kipling Flynn.

16:58.865 --> 17:00.856
Thanks.

17:06.039 --> 17:08.872
<i>How long till we reach Faraway Downs?</i>

17:08.942 --> 17:11.877
<i> Oh, we've been on it</i>
<i>for the last two days.</i>

17:15.348 --> 17:17.942
- Drover! Hey, Drover!
- <i>Yeah, love. How you doing?</i>

17:18.017 --> 17:20.416
<i>Good. Aren't you gonna stop</i>
<i>and have a rest for a while?</i>

17:20.487 --> 17:22.954
Nah, gotta make a delivery.
Put the kettle on.

17:23.021 --> 17:25.991
- I'll be round in a couple days. Give us a kiss.
- Okay.

17:26.059 --> 17:28.584
See you soon.

17:28.661 --> 17:31.027
- She's easy to get on with.
- Ah, she's trouble, that one.

17:31.097 --> 17:33.031
- See you later!
- <i>Bye!</i>

17:33.099 --> 17:36.034
You and my husband
share an interest.

17:36.102 --> 17:37.729
An interest? Really?

17:37.804 --> 17:41.535
Come on. We all know the real reason
that my husband is out here.

17:41.608 --> 17:44.543
Oh. Right.
You mean the breeding. Yeah.

17:44.611 --> 17:46.909
- Breeding?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

17:46.980 --> 17:49.073
No, we're both dead keen on breeding.

17:49.149 --> 17:51.083
I have this idea,
which, uh-which he loves.

17:51.151 --> 17:53.745
You might be quite excited
about it too, actually.

17:53.820 --> 17:57.551
Now, I'm a brumby man,
but his fancy English filly, Capricornia...

17:57.624 --> 17:59.353
<i>has really caught my eye.</i>

17:59.425 --> 18:01.985
I got to admit.
She is gorgeous. Really gorgeous.

18:02.061 --> 18:05.326
Gorgeous creature.

18:08.768 --> 18:11.737
<i>I've always wanted to mate an English</i>
<i>thoroughbred with a bush brumby.</i>

18:11.804 --> 18:15.740
<i>I mean, it'd be magic, wouldn't it?</i>
<i>Magic.</i>

18:15.808 --> 18:17.867
- <i>Imagine that combination.</i>
- Don't. Don't you say another word.

18:17.944 --> 18:20.742
- I know what you're implying.
- You've thought about it, too, haven't you?

18:20.813 --> 18:22.940
Capricornia-You- Poppycock!

18:23.016 --> 18:24.779
- What are you talking about?
- Poppycock!

18:35.762 --> 18:37.696
Coppers.

18:37.764 --> 18:41.359
- What are you talking about?
- You-You want-

18:43.503 --> 18:47.439
- You want to have it on with me.
- What? What was that?

18:47.507 --> 18:49.441
Oh, you know exactly what I'm saying.

18:49.509 --> 18:51.636
<i>Just like you have it on with</i>
<i>that poor girl you're exploiting...</i>

18:51.711 --> 18:53.872
and-and-and God knows how many others.

18:53.947 --> 18:55.312
What are you talking about?

18:59.953 --> 19:01.818
- You got a filthy mind, lady.
- You're an animal!

19:01.888 --> 19:04.914
I wouldn't have it on with you
if you were the only tart left in Australia.

19:04.991 --> 19:06.754
- Animal! You are a-
- Believe me, I wouldn't-

19:06.826 --> 19:08.259
<i>You-</i>

19:12.832 --> 19:14.322
<i>Oh!</i>

19:16.469 --> 19:17.800
Oh!

19:17.870 --> 19:19.132
<i>What was that?</i>

19:19.205 --> 19:21.366
- Stay in the car.
- No, no.

19:21.441 --> 19:24.239
Get your hands off me.

19:25.979 --> 19:28.345
For once in your life,
do as you're bloody told.

19:44.897 --> 19:47.798
<i>There she is.</i>

19:49.102 --> 19:52.071
Faraway Downs.

20:02.448 --> 20:05.906
<i>And that first time I saw her-</i>

20:05.985 --> 20:08.715
- <i>that Mrs. Boss.</i>
- Oh! Oh!

20:24.037 --> 20:27.131
Lady Ashley, wait! Don't go in there!

21:02.375 --> 21:04.400
I'm so sorry.

21:24.397 --> 21:26.831
<i>My family has had the honor of serving...</i>

21:26.899 --> 21:30.630
the owners of Faraway Downs
for three generations.

21:30.703 --> 21:33.263
<i>We know how hard this land can be.</i>

21:33.339 --> 21:36.206
<i>But Lord Maitland Ashley-he-</i>

21:36.275 --> 21:38.209
he never gave up.

21:38.277 --> 21:41.940
The only thing that could stop this decent
and courageous man was a spear...

21:42.014 --> 21:45.973
<i>from a murderous black,</i>
<i>the so-called King George.</i>

21:46.052 --> 21:48.919
<i>And he will be brought to justice.</i>

21:48.988 --> 21:52.219
<i>Let us now pray for Maitland Ashley...</i>

21:52.291 --> 21:55.886
<i>that his soul may enter peacefully</i>
<i>through the gates of heaven.</i>

22:05.138 --> 22:08.801
Lady Ashley, we can leave for Darwin
first thing in the morning.

22:08.875 --> 22:10.900
Yes, yes. Certainly, Mr. Fletcher.

22:10.977 --> 22:12.638
Watch the, um-

22:14.580 --> 22:17.879
I can't understand what my husband
would have seen out here.

22:20.286 --> 22:22.948
Yeah, this land has a strange power.

23:02.728 --> 23:06.824
<i>That first night, when the sun go to sleep...</i>

23:06.899 --> 23:11.393
<i>King George tell me</i>
<i>this land be healed.</i>

23:11.471 --> 23:16.465
<i>He tell'em me that woman-</i>
<i>that far, far away woman-</i>

23:16.542 --> 23:19.340
<i>she be like the rain.</i>

23:19.412 --> 23:23.508
<i>I've been thinking</i>
<i>I'm gonna sing her to me.</i>

23:25.585 --> 23:28.713
<i> Make the land sing.</i>

24:10.329 --> 24:14.095
I let you see me now.

24:14.166 --> 24:16.225
Who are you?

24:16.302 --> 24:18.395
I Nullah.

24:18.471 --> 24:20.371
How did you get in here?

24:20.439 --> 24:23.306
I make myself invisible...

24:23.376 --> 24:25.537
with <i>gulapa</i> magic!

24:33.686 --> 24:36.519
What do you want?

24:36.589 --> 24:40.025
That <i>balanda</i> Fletcher
been curse to this place.

24:41.294 --> 24:44.525
<i>But you like Rainbow Serpent.</i>

24:45.565 --> 24:47.829
You <i>mien-muk.</i>

24:47.900 --> 24:51.893
<i>You heal this land, so I sing you to me.</i>

24:53.406 --> 24:56.239
Like I sing a fish to me.

25:07.386 --> 25:09.183
<i>I sing, too...</i>

25:10.256 --> 25:12.816
when Mama and Fletcher...

25:14.460 --> 25:16.451
make wrong-side business.

25:16.529 --> 25:18.087
Wrong-sided business?

25:18.164 --> 25:20.632
You know.

25:20.700 --> 25:22.634
Laying down and tickling.

25:22.702 --> 25:26.468
- Oh, my goodness.
- Me and you secret.

25:26.539 --> 25:29.872
Oh, my goodness. Mr. Fletcher?

25:29.942 --> 25:32.274
I got to sing to Mama to warn her...

25:32.345 --> 25:34.370
that Lord Boss Ashley is coming down.

25:34.447 --> 25:36.711
Maitland? I- I-

25:36.782 --> 25:39.273
<i>I mean, Lord Ashley?</i>

25:39.352 --> 25:41.786
Yeah. He plenty funny.

25:41.854 --> 25:46.484
So that's why I took him down the billabong,
shown him all the big, fat, cheeky bulls.

25:46.559 --> 25:49.528
Come here. Look'em. Look.

25:49.595 --> 25:51.654
Get pushed across that river...

25:51.731 --> 25:53.665
over to Carney land.

25:53.733 --> 25:55.462
The bulls.

25:55.534 --> 25:57.729
<i>"Billabong"?</i>

25:57.803 --> 25:59.930
<i>That's where Maitland was killed.</i>

26:00.006 --> 26:02.201
<i> But, Mrs. Boss, that spear was-</i>

26:02.274 --> 26:04.139
Please don't.

26:04.210 --> 26:06.007
Don't make'em that policeman
take away my boy.

26:07.446 --> 26:09.243
Them coppers. That bad Fletcher.

26:09.315 --> 26:13.183
He say you see me,
you send me to the Mission Island.

26:13.252 --> 26:16.312
To that lock-lock.
Throw away bloody key.

26:17.590 --> 26:19.558
Please, missus! Quick!

26:19.625 --> 26:22.185
I make us invisible.

27:44.643 --> 27:48.101
- Mrs. Boss.
- Oh! Oh. It's you.

27:48.180 --> 27:51.172
Last night, I show you-

27:51.250 --> 27:52.342
Hyah!

27:52.418 --> 27:54.852
where-

27:56.589 --> 27:58.614
Yeah.
She's a beautiful day, isn't she?

28:00.226 --> 28:01.955
How was your sleep? Restful?

28:02.027 --> 28:04.154
I wouldn't say so, no.

28:04.230 --> 28:06.790
Yeah, now, the boys are-
the boys are just finishing up.

28:06.866 --> 28:10.324
Gotta tell you, they're a pretty sorry mob
of cattle. Seems hardly worth the effort.

28:10.402 --> 28:12.336
Ready to go, Lady Ashley?

28:13.239 --> 28:14.331
Billabong.

28:14.406 --> 28:16.271
Mr. Fletcher...

28:16.342 --> 28:19.140
<i>tell me about the big,</i>
<i>fat cows that cross the river...</i>

28:19.211 --> 28:21.145
down at the "billabalong,"
or whatever you call it.

28:21.213 --> 28:23.875
Near the billabong?
No, that's Carney property over there.

28:23.949 --> 28:25.439
Our cattle don't cross the river.

28:25.518 --> 28:27.850
- Apparently they do.
- <i>Yeah?</i>

28:27.920 --> 28:29.444
Who-Who says they do?

28:30.523 --> 28:32.514
That little boy there.

28:38.898 --> 28:42.561
<i>Oh, you mean the little half-caste fella?</i>

28:42.635 --> 28:45.035
Hey. Hey, little fella. Come here.

28:45.104 --> 28:48.835
<i>Come and tell Mr. Fletcher</i>
<i>what you told me last night.</i>

28:49.809 --> 28:51.800
Yeah, come on, Nullah.

28:53.145 --> 28:55.204
- <i> Yes.</i>
- They're funny ones.

29:03.622 --> 29:05.715
Now...

29:05.791 --> 29:08.919
did you see big, fat cattle
crossing Marmont River?

29:08.994 --> 29:13.488
<i>Or were they just Carney cattle on</i>
<i>the other side of the river having a drink?</i>

29:15.901 --> 29:18.836
<i>Them just Carney cattle, Mr. Fletcher.</i>

29:18.904 --> 29:21.702
- I been lookin' myself.
- Yeah?

29:26.345 --> 29:30.111
Ah, you tell great, big,
tall stories, don't ya, eh?

29:30.182 --> 29:34.278
<i> It's all right, Mr. Fletcher.</i>
<i>I'm sure the boy just made a mistake.</i>

29:34.353 --> 29:36.719
<i> All right.</i>
<i>We best get going, Lady Ashley.</i>

29:36.789 --> 29:41.021
Sing Song. Take the little fella to the kitchen.
Give him a big feed of that tucker he likes.

29:41.093 --> 29:44.062
- Forgive me, Mr. Fletcher.
- Look. I understand.

29:44.129 --> 29:45.892
You barely slept.

29:45.965 --> 29:47.956
- Wait, wait.
- Let me go.

29:49.969 --> 29:52.233
Yeah. Well, that old windmill
hasn't turned in years.

29:52.304 --> 29:54.602
He's a sweet little boy.
I don't think he meant any harm.

29:54.673 --> 29:57.699
Yeah, no, they're funny, little creamies.
They're all a bit soft in the head, yeah.

29:57.776 --> 30:00.802
<i>That's why the, uh, government</i>
<i>sends them to the mission.</i>

30:00.880 --> 30:03.747
<i>They all tell bloody monstrous lies.</i>
<i>Yeah. And the next one, quick.</i>

30:03.816 --> 30:05.750
<i>Come on. We haven't got all day.</i>

30:05.818 --> 30:07.649
<i>I no bloody liar!</i>

30:09.021 --> 30:12.218
<i>He liar! He say this not work!</i>

30:24.904 --> 30:26.633
Fletcher liar!

30:27.673 --> 30:29.903
- <i>No! Leave him alone!</i>
- Nullah!

30:29.975 --> 30:32.443
- Fletcher!
- I curse you!

30:32.511 --> 30:35.344
Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

30:35.414 --> 30:38.850
- Please!
- Run! Run! Run, Nullah! Run!

30:38.918 --> 30:41.148
I curse you!

30:41.220 --> 30:43.484
Leave him alone!

30:43.555 --> 30:46.456
<i>Mr. Fletcher!</i>

30:46.525 --> 30:49.323
- Leave him alone!
- Mr. Fletcher!

30:53.399 --> 30:55.492
<i> Get off my property.</i>

30:55.567 --> 30:57.467
You no longer work for me.

30:57.536 --> 31:00.937
<i> If I go, my men go with me.</i>

31:01.006 --> 31:04.965
There won't be a single bloody beast in the
stockyard to start the drove in the morning.

31:05.044 --> 31:08.104
<i>You heard what I said.</i>
<i>Get off my property!</i>

31:08.180 --> 31:10.114
- Yeah?
- <i>Go!</i>

31:10.182 --> 31:12.707
Now!

31:15.754 --> 31:17.949
You're the boss.

31:19.124 --> 31:21.058
<i>Flynn, get in the car.</i>

31:21.126 --> 31:23.060
I'll give you a new job somewhere else.

31:23.128 --> 31:25.187
Bunchemup, grab the gear.
Pack it up.

31:25.264 --> 31:27.562
<i>I'll see you in Desperation Creek</i>
<i>in a few days.</i>

31:32.638 --> 31:35.266
Bloody old fool.

31:44.283 --> 31:47.013
Carney's gonna get this property.

31:47.086 --> 31:50.078
Been a pleasure working for ya.
Real pleasure.

31:50.155 --> 31:51.884
<i>Yeah.</i>

32:17.616 --> 32:21.916
<i> That strange woman-</i>
<i>she fire'em that Fletcher.</i>

32:27.326 --> 32:29.521
<i>He can't hurt Mama no more.</i>

32:34.466 --> 32:39.802
<i>From that day on,</i>
<i>we call her... Mrs. Boss.</i>

32:44.309 --> 32:47.369
Why would Fletcher block the water pump?

32:47.446 --> 32:49.846
I don't know. All crazy.

32:49.915 --> 32:52.816
- White fella, blackfella- all crazy.
- Crazy.

33:03.829 --> 33:06.263
<i> Mr. Flynn.</i>

33:07.633 --> 33:10.466
- Milady.
- Don't get up.

33:11.904 --> 33:14.304
The truth, Mr. Flynn.

33:18.510 --> 33:21.673
This, uh, ledger...

33:21.747 --> 33:26.810
which, um, Fletcher had me keep
for the benefit of your husband...

33:26.885 --> 33:29.911
is a tale of decline and ruin...

33:29.988 --> 33:33.583
redolent of the great Gibbon.

33:33.659 --> 33:36.093
There is, however, another...

33:36.161 --> 33:38.459
kept for the benefit...

33:38.530 --> 33:41.328
of Mr. Carney...

33:41.400 --> 33:45.860
<i>in which is recorded</i>
<i>all the unbranded...</i>

33:45.938 --> 33:47.929
fat cattle...

33:48.006 --> 33:52.306
- siphoned off across the river and into his herd.
- <i>## </i>

33:52.377 --> 33:54.607
And the boy.

33:54.680 --> 33:58.172
<i>He's Fletcher's son, isn't he?</i>

33:58.250 --> 34:02.482
As with all things Fletcher,
it's impossible to prove anything.

34:02.554 --> 34:05.148
Still, if Carney's good Christian wife...

34:05.224 --> 34:08.193
ever comes to the same conclusion
as yourself...

34:08.260 --> 34:13.061
Fletcher's chances of marrying
their daughter would be dashed.

34:13.132 --> 34:15.998
I'm going to the authorities,
and I will be telling them-

34:16.068 --> 34:18.730
- Carney <i>is</i> the authority here.
- Are you suggesting...

34:18.804 --> 34:22.864
I let him steal my cattle and buy my property
for a fraction of what it's worth?

34:22.940 --> 34:27.969
<i>I'm suggesting that you continue</i>
<i>to do what your husband set out to do.</i>

34:29.715 --> 34:31.080
Drove.

34:32.251 --> 34:35.152
Drove the cattle to Darwin.

34:35.219 --> 34:38.985
Would you mind?

34:39.056 --> 34:41.217
I need a drink.

34:41.293 --> 34:44.126
My lady, drove.

34:44.196 --> 34:47.255
Drove the cattle to Darwin,
sell them to the army...

34:47.331 --> 34:49.232
and you'll break Carney's monopoly.

34:49.301 --> 34:52.099
Use the profits to put Faraway Downs
back on its feet.

34:52.170 --> 34:54.230
You go back to London.

34:54.306 --> 34:56.399
You're sitting pretty
for the rest of your life.

34:56.475 --> 34:58.443
That's what Maitland
said he was doing.

34:58.510 --> 35:02.276
And there's no reason
why you can't do the same.

35:11.323 --> 35:13.291
<i>There is just one small problem.</i>

35:14.793 --> 35:18.388
Having dismissed Fletcher,
there's no one to muster the cattle.

35:29.041 --> 35:30.975
Hyah! Hyah!

35:33.312 --> 35:35.712
<i>Flynn! Mrs. Boss!</i>

35:35.781 --> 35:37.976
<i>It's the Drover!</i>

35:50.896 --> 35:53.763
Drover! Drover!

35:53.832 --> 35:55.823
Hyah!

36:04.710 --> 36:06.803
Hyah!

36:08.347 --> 36:11.111
Yeah, Drover! Yeah!

36:11.183 --> 36:13.174
Teach me how to
break them brumbies!

36:14.853 --> 36:16.844
- See any boys in there?
- <i>No.</i>

36:16.922 --> 36:19.015
Goolaj, go see if they're
out in the top paddock.

36:19.091 --> 36:21.958
- Mr. Drover!
- <i>Just get the bloody brumbies in there.</i>

36:22.027 --> 36:24.587
- I'll find out what the hell's going on.
- Teach me to break them horses.

36:24.663 --> 36:26.790
- Fill the water trough, son.
- I need to speak to you!

36:26.865 --> 36:29.459
<i>Where the hell are</i>
<i>all the bloody stockmen, eh?</i>

36:29.534 --> 36:32.526
- That's what I need to speak to you about.
- Where's Fletcher?

36:32.604 --> 36:36.267
- We disagreed, and I dismissed him.
- Dismissed?

36:36.341 --> 36:39.003
- Yes.
- Wa- Hang on. What about the cattle?

36:39.077 --> 36:41.068
Well, it beggars belief,
but as he was leaving...

36:41.146 --> 36:44.775
he deliberately let the cows out of
the, uh- I don't know-whatever you call it...

36:44.850 --> 36:45.976
and they ran off!

36:46.051 --> 36:49.043
Damn! Do you realize, woman,
what you've done?

36:49.121 --> 36:51.681
Mr. Drover, do not take that tone with me.
Thank you very much!

36:51.757 --> 36:53.691
- Don't take that tone with you, huh?
- No.

36:53.759 --> 36:55.727
I'm asking you, woman,
do you know what you've done?

36:55.794 --> 36:59.025
I won't get another drove this late in the season.
You've cost me my living.

36:59.097 --> 37:02.362
- Can't you just round them up?
- Round them up, huh? Oh, round them up. Yeah!

37:02.434 --> 37:05.494
- Yes. You just go get them.
- 1,500 head of cattle-

37:05.570 --> 37:05.721
Oh!

37:05.722 --> 37:08.835
Scattered over a million acres
with just me and my two men.

37:08.907 --> 37:10.966
That's a great idea. Stupid cow.

37:11.043 --> 37:13.534
Mr. Drover,
I was right to dismiss Mr. Fletcher...

37:13.612 --> 37:14.977
on moral grounds.

37:15.047 --> 37:16.378
Moral grounds?

37:16.448 --> 37:19.611
<i>You're at that again, are ya?</i>
<i>Let me guess.</i>

37:19.685 --> 37:21.846
He wanted to, uh, exploit you, did he?

37:21.920 --> 37:23.649
- Fancy you, did he?
- What?

37:23.722 --> 37:24.295
Stop it. I -

37:24.296 --> 37:26.919
Is there any man in this
world who doesn't fancy you?

37:26.992 --> 37:28.755
- Please.
- Huh?

37:28.827 --> 37:31.728
Mr. Fletcher is working for Mr. Carney.

37:31.797 --> 37:34.925
<i>They were pushing the best</i>
<i>of the unbranded cattle...</i>

37:35.000 --> 37:39.903
across the river
onto Mr. Carney's property.

37:39.971 --> 37:42.531
They were stealing!

37:44.810 --> 37:48.211
- There's no surprises there.
- No, he's a bad man.

37:48.280 --> 37:51.113
All right, all right.
But look. You can't prove it, right?

37:51.183 --> 37:53.242
- Well-
- <i>You can't.</i>

37:53.318 --> 37:57.584
And you can't win against Carney.
So just take my advice, lady.

37:57.656 --> 38:01.888
Grab King Carney's offer and go the hell
back to England as quickly as possible.

38:01.960 --> 38:04.861
That way you'd make everybody happy,
especially me.

38:08.834 --> 38:10.802
So you're just going to walk away?

38:10.869 --> 38:12.962
I learned a long time ago
not to fight other people's wars.

38:13.038 --> 38:15.598
Wait! Wait! Wait! Mr. Drover, wait!

38:15.674 --> 38:18.575
Please, please, please!
Mr. Drover, please! Please! Wait!

38:18.643 --> 38:21.203
Please. I-

38:21.279 --> 38:24.874
Listen. You said that your dream was
to breed a thoroughbred with a-

38:24.950 --> 38:26.212
with a bush brumby.

38:26.284 --> 38:28.650
<i>If you agree to help me, I-</i>

38:29.988 --> 38:32.149
I will give you my Capricornia.

38:43.335 --> 38:46.827
And how we gonna do a drove
with just me and my two men, huh?

38:50.976 --> 38:52.967
Oh, crikey.

38:53.044 --> 38:55.308
<i>Mum was a drover's boy for Fletcher.</i>

38:55.380 --> 38:58.076
<i>Bandy was a drover's boy</i>
<i>a long time ago.</i>

38:58.150 --> 39:01.517
<i>Some white stockmen like to have</i>
<i>an Aboriginal woman on the drove...</i>

39:01.586 --> 39:03.520
to keep 'em company at night.

39:03.588 --> 39:06.148
<i>They shave their heads,</i>
<i>make 'em look like boys...</i>

39:06.224 --> 39:08.852
<i>and work 'em like any other stockman</i>
<i>during the day.</i>

39:08.927 --> 39:10.861
That's, uh-What do you call it?

39:10.929 --> 39:13.762
- Exploiting them.
- Exploiting, yes.

39:15.767 --> 39:17.701
Anyway, we're still in trouble.

39:17.769 --> 39:21.705
We gotta have seven good riders at least,
and the most I can count is five.

39:21.773 --> 39:23.832
- What have we got? We've got me-
- You.

39:23.909 --> 39:26.173
- Magarri.
- Yeah, Magarri!

39:26.244 --> 39:27.677
- Goolaj-
- Great.

39:27.746 --> 39:30.544
We got Daisy. Nice ride.
And, uh, Bandy. Good work.

39:30.615 --> 39:33.311
<i>Oh. What about Mr. Sing Song?</i>
<i>Mr. Sing Song, ride horse?</i>

39:33.385 --> 39:36.047
- Hey. Don't look at me.
- Sing Song, me real good cooker.

39:36.121 --> 39:38.351
Cook's wagon at best.
We got five, right? It's not enough.

39:38.423 --> 39:40.357
We need two more experienced riders.

39:40.425 --> 39:43.519
I did that run once back in 1935...

39:43.595 --> 39:45.613
with Magarri, Dingo Jones
and the Drongo brothers-

39:45.614 --> 39:46.325
Drongo brothers.

39:46.398 --> 39:49.834
- true knights of the outback.
- Mr. Flynn. Can you ride?

39:49.901 --> 39:51.732
- I can.
- I won't carry a drunk.

39:51.803 --> 39:52.997
But don't.

39:53.071 --> 39:55.005
<i>I ride'em real bloody good!</i>

39:55.073 --> 39:58.565
I drove those no-good cheeky bulls
into the big, bloody metal ship.

39:58.643 --> 40:02.204
- All right. Five and a quarter.
- Six and a quarter.

40:02.280 --> 40:03.975
<i>What?</i>

40:04.049 --> 40:06.574
Lady, this ain't trotting
in Kensington Gardens.

40:06.651 --> 40:11.213
<i> Mr. Drover, I could show you</i>
<i>a thing or two about horses.</i>

40:11.289 --> 40:14.725
Pretty sure, when it comes to horses,
there's nothing you can show me.

40:14.793 --> 40:18.160
- Bring the horse.
- You can't be serious.

40:18.230 --> 40:20.323
Bring the horse.

40:20.398 --> 40:22.389
Oh, this should be interesting.

40:24.102 --> 40:27.594
<i>Move along! Move along!</i>
<i>Rah! Rah!</i>

40:27.672 --> 40:29.230
Move along!

40:29.307 --> 40:31.104
Rah! Rah!

40:31.176 --> 40:33.406
- What are you doing?
- <i>Shoo! Shoo!</i>

40:33.478 --> 40:36.538
Rah, rah! Rah. Rah! Move it!

40:36.615 --> 40:39.379
- Lady Ashley-
- Move it! Move it! They're going the wrong way.

40:39.451 --> 40:41.385
Rah! Rah!

40:41.453 --> 40:43.944
<i>Rah! Rah!</i>

40:44.022 --> 40:47.617
Oh! It's easy.
Stubborn things. Silly cows.

40:47.692 --> 40:50.525
- Hey, hey, hey. What the bloody hell you doing?
- Come on.

40:50.595 --> 40:53.758
You're scattering them all over the place.
Get up the back there, up the tail.

40:56.101 --> 40:59.764
Get up there. Go, go, go, go, go!
Don't let 'em break away.

40:59.838 --> 41:02.204
Go on.

41:05.610 --> 41:09.444
Run, you cows! Move, you cows!

41:11.016 --> 41:13.211
We're trying to get the cows up there.

41:14.653 --> 41:17.952
- Not too bad, Lady Ashley.
- I've got him! I've got him!

41:19.324 --> 41:21.292
I think we're doing pretty well.

41:23.428 --> 41:26.397
You crazy- take all this stuff.

41:26.464 --> 41:28.455
Where you think you going?
Shanghai?

41:28.533 --> 41:30.660
A lady never knows
what she might need.

41:50.021 --> 41:53.149
Run, Nullah! Run! Run!

41:53.224 --> 41:56.489
- Coppers! Coppers!
- <i>Tank! Run! Tank.</i>

41:56.561 --> 41:59.086
Tank, Nullah! Tank!

42:00.432 --> 42:02.730
<i>Bandy, coppers!</i>

42:02.801 --> 42:05.497
Hurry up!

42:23.922 --> 42:24.566
Turn 'em loose.

42:24.567 --> 42:27.483
<i> Go on. Get out.</i>
<i>You two, check the east side.</i>

42:27.559 --> 42:30.357
<i>Move, move! Hurry up!</i>

42:41.640 --> 42:43.699
<i>Daisy's in the tank.</i>

42:44.776 --> 42:47.870
Shh!

42:49.447 --> 42:51.381
Bandy, tea. Tea.

42:54.119 --> 42:57.111
<i> Where's the creamy?</i>

43:01.092 --> 43:03.026
<i>Trackers.</i>

43:14.506 --> 43:15.837
<i>Nullah.</i>

43:23.581 --> 43:28.211
Lady Ashley, Sergeant Callahan
of the Northern Territory Police.

43:37.128 --> 43:38.959
Grab the float.

43:43.134 --> 43:46.228
I can't begin to tell you,
Lady Ashley, how the...

43:46.304 --> 43:49.467
tragedy which befell
your late husband has...

43:49.541 --> 43:54.171
wrung sympathy from the hearts of every civilized
man and woman in the Northern Territory.

44:01.786 --> 44:04.118
Let me assure you, Lady Ashley...

44:04.189 --> 44:06.953
that the suspect, King George,
will be brought to justice.

44:07.025 --> 44:11.519
But surely a witch doctor could conceal
his own tracks, Sergeant, could he not?

44:11.596 --> 44:14.588
Makes no difference.
It's only a matter of time.

44:40.825 --> 44:42.690
Shh!

44:52.504 --> 44:56.634
Oh, incidentally, I met up with
your former manager, Neil Fletcher.

44:56.708 --> 45:00.667
He informed me that there's a half-blood
Aboriginal child out here somewhere.

45:00.745 --> 45:04.875
I thought we might pick him up
and put him in the good hands of the church.

45:06.618 --> 45:09.018
I will be sure to look out for him.

45:11.956 --> 45:13.947
Till we meet again, Lady Ashley.

45:16.094 --> 45:18.858
<i>Get 'em in the back, Constable. Let's go.</i>

45:34.112 --> 45:35.670
<i>They're in the tank!</i>

45:35.747 --> 45:36.907
<i>Drover!</i>

45:36.981 --> 45:40.747
<i>Drover, help them! Quickly!</i>

45:44.055 --> 45:46.717
Mama!

45:46.791 --> 45:48.884
Easy. That's it. I got you. I got you.

46:00.104 --> 46:02.698
Come on, Daisy. Come on.

46:25.129 --> 46:28.098
<i>Daisy! Daisy!</i>

46:28.166 --> 46:30.293
Daisy! Daisy!

46:33.872 --> 46:37.205
<i>Daisy! Daisy.</i>

46:37.275 --> 46:40.267
<i>Daisy!</i>

47:25.823 --> 47:27.848
Daisy.

47:49.480 --> 47:52.643
When someone dies
in the Aboriginal culture...

47:52.717 --> 47:55.481
you're not supposed to
say their name again.

47:58.423 --> 48:00.653
He needs motherin'.

48:00.725 --> 48:02.886
Mothering?

48:02.961 --> 48:04.952
<i>Yep.</i>

48:05.029 --> 48:09.523
<i>You're a woman,</i>
<i>so, go on, get down there.</i>

48:09.600 --> 48:14.333
I'm, uh- I'm not, uh, uh-

48:14.405 --> 48:16.703
What?

48:18.810 --> 48:20.801
Good with children.

48:20.878 --> 48:24.006
Oh. Huh.

48:43.468 --> 48:45.459
<i>Nullah.</i>

48:47.105 --> 48:50.438
I wanted to extend my condolences.

48:50.508 --> 48:52.772
Go away.

49:16.234 --> 49:19.897
Would you, uh-
Would you like to hear a story?

49:19.971 --> 49:22.701
What story?

49:24.742 --> 49:29.270
Uh, well, it's, uh- it's called-

49:36.754 --> 49:39.416
- It's called <i>The Wizard of Oz.</i>
- What's a wizard?

49:39.490 --> 49:42.459
Well, a wizard is a sort of...

49:42.527 --> 49:43.926
magic man.

49:45.096 --> 49:47.223
<i>Gulapa.</i>

49:51.369 --> 49:53.337
<i>Mama say I gulapa.</i>

49:55.239 --> 49:57.571
- I magic man.
- Really?

49:57.642 --> 49:59.906
I wizard man.

50:03.881 --> 50:06.748
We can't say
Mama's name no more.

50:10.988 --> 50:12.979
No. Well-

50:13.057 --> 50:16.151
Uh, anyway, there's a girl...

50:16.227 --> 50:18.752
and there's a dog.

50:18.830 --> 50:22.630
Ruff. Ruff, ruff, ruff!
And there's a tornado-

50:22.700 --> 50:25.965
- Well, no. It's a- In the film, it's a twister.
- Who twister?

50:26.037 --> 50:29.598
Oh, no, no. Twister's not a person.
It's like a big-Whoosh!

50:29.674 --> 50:31.767
- Like a storm.
- Like the wet?

50:31.843 --> 50:34.277
Like the wet.

50:34.345 --> 50:38.645
Anyway,
the story takes place in a, um-

50:38.716 --> 50:41.446
well, a faraway land...

50:41.519 --> 50:43.510
called Oz.

50:45.056 --> 50:47.047
- This good story.
- Oh, well-

50:47.125 --> 50:51.027
- Got song?
- Yes, yes. Lots of songs.

50:51.095 --> 50:52.562
I like song.

50:54.132 --> 50:56.123
You sing'em me,
I learn'em song.

50:56.200 --> 50:58.691
No, no, no. No.

51:00.071 --> 51:02.232
No.

51:04.308 --> 51:07.436
Well, I- Uh, some.

51:07.512 --> 51:09.844
- I'll sing a little.
- Good.

51:09.914 --> 51:14.715
# Somewhere over the, uh-
the rainbow #

51:14.785 --> 51:16.878
- Rainbow Serpent?
- Yes.

51:16.954 --> 51:19.787
That bloody good. Keep going.
You funny singer, but good song.

51:19.857 --> 51:23.224
Oh.
# Somewhere #

51:26.731 --> 51:30.360
#There's some birds and they-#

51:30.434 --> 51:32.493
- Uh- Oh-
- Keep going. Come on.

51:32.570 --> 51:37.598
# Someday I'll wish upon a- a star #

51:37.675 --> 51:39.609
#And #

51:41.112 --> 51:43.706
- Come on. Sing more.
- Uh-Yes.

51:43.781 --> 51:47.911
#Wake up where the clouds
are far behind #

51:47.985 --> 51:51.921
# Dreams really do come #

51:51.989 --> 51:55.618
#True ##

51:57.695 --> 51:59.686
Oh!

52:01.465 --> 52:03.456
Dreaming song.

52:04.969 --> 52:06.903
<i>Mrs. Boss...</i>

52:06.971 --> 52:10.270
we gotta get those no-good, cheeky bulls
into the big, bloody metal ship.

52:11.309 --> 52:13.140
That's right.

52:13.211 --> 52:15.577
That's what dreaming songs
tell us, Mrs. Boss.

52:16.948 --> 52:19.314
We've got to get those
no-good, big, bloody bulls...

52:19.383 --> 52:21.317
into that metal ship.

52:27.558 --> 52:31.517
I'm sorry. I thought he could-
I thought he could do it.

52:31.596 --> 52:35.054
Yeah, well, people don't change,
Miss Ashley.

52:45.009 --> 52:47.477
Twister. Twister!

52:49.880 --> 52:55.819
- No desert comes drier than Kipling Flynn, milady!
- Well done!

52:55.886 --> 52:58.446
<i>Well done, Kipling!</i>

52:58.522 --> 53:00.285
Hey!

53:00.358 --> 53:03.088
Flynn Kipling! Yea!

53:03.160 --> 53:06.027
Hey, hey!

53:06.097 --> 53:09.123
- Welcome! Welcome!
- <i>Hey, Nullah!</i>

53:09.200 --> 53:11.361
All right.

53:11.435 --> 53:14.632
<i>Well, Mr. Drover, I believe</i>
<i>we have the appropriate number.</i>

53:14.705 --> 53:17.299
- The appropriate number, huh?
- Yes.

53:17.375 --> 53:20.208
Well, listen up.
I'm only gonna say this once.

53:20.278 --> 53:23.770
I run the show.
Everybody does exactly...

53:23.848 --> 53:25.782
as she's told.

53:26.917 --> 53:29.613
- Understood?
- Understood.

53:32.590 --> 53:35.119
No matter your experience
or your age, you pull your weight.

53:35.120 --> 53:35.616
Yes, boss.

53:35.693 --> 53:38.787
And above all,
the Drover's law: no grog.

53:38.863 --> 53:41.661
Now...

53:41.732 --> 53:44.462
if there's a rush and the cattle
are stampeding towards you...

53:44.535 --> 53:47.402
it's not much good prancing
and dancing about on your show pony.

53:47.471 --> 53:50.463
There's only one thing cattle fear
more than a man on a horse...

53:50.541 --> 53:53.442
and that's a man standing
on his own two feet...

53:53.511 --> 53:56.002
staring 'em right between the eyes.

53:57.448 --> 54:00.349
Now, you sure you mob
are still up for it?

54:00.418 --> 54:01.510
Mm-hmm.

54:04.822 --> 54:06.983
You can count on us.

54:07.058 --> 54:09.049
Oh, crikey.

54:10.428 --> 54:13.693
Well, we're what we are.

54:13.764 --> 54:16.130
Gotta get to Darwin
before the ship sails.

54:16.200 --> 54:18.191
Let's get cracking.

54:18.269 --> 54:20.169
The rest of you jokers follow me.

54:20.237 --> 54:22.228
- Hyah!
- Hyah!

54:22.306 --> 54:25.298
I'll get the gate.
Stay back. Don't let 'em scatter.

54:30.314 --> 54:32.714
There, mate. Push 'em over.
Don't let 'em go down there.

54:34.418 --> 54:37.581
- That's it.
- Get 'em up!

54:37.655 --> 54:40.954
- Whoo!
- <i>Hyah!</i>

54:41.025 --> 54:43.152
Get up there!

54:54.905 --> 54:57.738
<i>So we start cracking them whips...</i>

54:57.808 --> 55:01.938
<i>and driving them cheeky bulls</i>
<i>all the way across the land...</i>

55:02.947 --> 55:05.973
<i>to that place they call'em Darwin.</i>

55:09.453 --> 55:12.752
All right.
We'll push 'em straight across here.

55:12.823 --> 55:14.222
Ho!

55:16.627 --> 55:20.085
Very good. Keep 'em movin'.
Nice and steady.

55:22.366 --> 55:24.266
<i> Go on!</i>

55:24.335 --> 55:25.461
- <i>Go on!</i>
- Hyah!

55:25.536 --> 55:26.969
<i>Keep 'em moving.</i>

55:30.141 --> 55:31.802
Giddyup! Giddap!

55:36.414 --> 55:39.850
<i> While the war rages on</i>
<i>in Europe, the Japanese are on the march.</i>

55:39.917 --> 55:42.477
<i>There are reports of an alliance</i>
<i>between the warmongers...</i>

55:42.553 --> 55:45.386
of Germany, Italy and Japan...

55:45.456 --> 55:49.449
which threatens to expand World War II
to the shores of Australia.

55:49.527 --> 55:52.325
<i>This is a war of the air,</i>
<i>but on the ground...</i>

55:52.396 --> 55:55.832
<i>the War Office will announce</i>
<i>who has won the army's contract...</i>

55:55.900 --> 55:58.630
<i>to supply good Aussie beef to the troops.</i>

55:58.702 --> 56:01.000
Couple of days
won't make any difference, Captain.

56:01.071 --> 56:03.005
Might as well sign
the contract now, eh?

56:03.073 --> 56:05.906
I wouldn't be too sure of that,
Mr. Carney.

56:05.976 --> 56:11.004
Air force chaps just spotted a big mob of cattle,
1,500 head, crossing the Marmont River.

56:11.081 --> 56:14.778
Marmont River?
That's Faraway Downs.

56:14.852 --> 56:18.913
Are you, uh, running cattle
out of Faraway Downs, Mr. Fletcher?

56:18.989 --> 56:21.014
Uh, no, no.
I don't work there anymore.

56:21.091 --> 56:24.458
Well, I suppose Lady Ashley's droving
the cattle herself.

56:24.528 --> 56:27.827
Someone must be helping her.

56:29.166 --> 56:31.794
That's right, Neil.
Someone must be helping her.

56:44.615 --> 56:47.812
<i>When Mrs. Boss first come to this land...</i>

56:47.885 --> 56:49.819
<i>she look but she not see.</i>

56:55.593 --> 56:59.689
<i>Now she got her eyes open</i>
<i>for the first time.</i>

57:11.642 --> 57:14.543
<i>Some places got spirits.</i>

57:14.612 --> 57:16.580
<i>White fellas don't know.</i>

57:17.615 --> 57:19.913
<i>Some places no good to go.</i>

57:33.397 --> 57:36.298
You gonna sing'em
them cattle tonight?

57:36.367 --> 57:40.804
No, Nullah. Not me.
I'm the orchestra.

57:40.871 --> 57:43.635
That's why I always carry this-

57:43.707 --> 57:47.768
the famous J. Albert & Son
boomerang harmonica.

57:47.845 --> 57:49.779
Can you play that rainbow song?

57:51.282 --> 57:56.345
Well, I've got the latest 100 songs
of the hit parade here.

58:06.897 --> 58:09.058
<i>I like that rainbow song.</i>

58:09.133 --> 58:12.591
<i>It's all about the dreaming.</i>

58:12.670 --> 58:14.661
<i>Gulapa</i> not teach me that yet.

58:14.738 --> 58:16.501
Who's <i>gulapa?</i>

58:16.574 --> 58:20.101
He's my grandfather, King George.

58:21.478 --> 58:25.505
King George... is your grandfather?

58:25.583 --> 58:27.744
<i>He teach me sing a fish song.</i>

58:27.818 --> 58:29.752
<i>He teach me sing down fear.</i>

58:29.820 --> 58:34.450
<i>Fear, evil spirit, wild beast.</i>

58:34.525 --> 58:36.823
Gulapa <i>teach me plenty songs.</i>

58:36.894 --> 58:39.954
<i>Gulapa</i> teach me
that day down the billabong.

58:48.973 --> 58:51.874
Mr. Drover, what is that chanting?

58:51.942 --> 58:54.809
<i>Goolaj and Magarri singing the cattle.</i>

58:54.878 --> 58:56.812
Just keeps them calm at night.

58:56.880 --> 59:01.283
<i>We do it in shifts. Those boys will</i>
<i>finish up in a couple hours. So, Bandy-</i>

59:01.352 --> 59:02.876
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- You show Mrs. Boss...

59:02.953 --> 59:05.046
- <i>how it's done, all right?</i>
- <i>Right.</i>

59:05.122 --> 59:08.091
Sing Song, you and me are gonna
serenade 'em till 3:00, and, uh...

59:08.158 --> 59:12.026
the safest shift is predawn, so that's
the boy soprano and his orchestra.

59:12.096 --> 59:14.621
- All right? You're on till the sun comes up.
- Yes, boss.

59:14.698 --> 59:16.689
All right.
Everybody get some shut-eye.

59:16.767 --> 59:19.167
Uh, Mr. Drover...

59:19.236 --> 59:23.036
I really don't think it's appropriate
to work a child of Nullah's age like that.

59:23.107 --> 59:25.667
<i>Now, I am more than willing</i>
<i>to take his shift.</i>

59:25.743 --> 59:28.473
- But, Mrs. Boss, I plenty old enough.
- <i>No.</i>

59:28.545 --> 59:31.480
- I'm talking now, hmm? Manners.
- <i> Oi, oi, oi. Steady on.</i>

59:31.548 --> 59:34.483
<i>I'm</i> talking.
Look. Just relax, will ya?

59:34.551 --> 59:36.485
The boy's gotta pull his weight
like everyone else.

59:36.553 --> 59:38.714
When I was his age,
I was manning outstations.

59:38.789 --> 59:41.349
- Not everybody's you, Mr. Drover.
- That's right.

59:41.425 --> 59:44.417
Not everyone's me. I'm the boss.

59:46.330 --> 59:48.423
You're on the 3:00 shift. All right?

59:48.499 --> 59:50.194
Yes, boss.

59:50.267 --> 59:52.735
- <i>Night, boss.</i>
- 3:00 a. m?

59:52.803 --> 59:55.567
- Relax, lady. He'll be fine. Good night.
- Night, Mrs. Boss.

59:55.639 --> 59:58.403
Oh. Good night.

59:58.475 --> 01:00:00.500
Good night, Sing Song.

01:00:00.577 --> 01:00:02.850
<i>You're on the 12:00 shift.</i>
<i>I suggest you get some sleep.</i>

01:00:02.851 --> 01:00:03.842
<i> Night, Bandy.</i>

01:00:03.914 --> 01:00:05.882
- <i>Night, Nullah.</i>
- <i> Good night, Flynn.</i>

01:00:05.949 --> 01:00:08.440
Night, Nullah.

01:00:08.752 --> 01:00:10.583
<i>Night-night, Jedda.</i>

01:00:28.772 --> 01:00:32.708
Lord Ashley was killed
by a glass-tipped spear.

01:00:32.776 --> 01:00:34.641
Are you sure?

01:00:34.712 --> 01:00:36.577
You and me secret.

01:01:15.352 --> 01:01:17.286
Rush! Rush!

01:01:22.059 --> 01:01:24.823
<i>They're heading towards the cliff face!</i>

01:01:24.895 --> 01:01:26.624
<i>A stampede! Where's Nullah?</i>

01:01:26.697 --> 01:01:30.360
Get on your horse
and stay with Goolaj.

01:01:30.434 --> 01:01:34.461
<i>Come on. Split up and circle the herd</i>
<i>before they go over the edge!</i>

01:01:34.538 --> 01:01:36.870
Sing Song, pack the camp.
Get the hell out of there!

01:01:45.115 --> 01:01:47.515
<i>Head them off!</i>

01:01:51.922 --> 01:01:53.549
Don't let them split!

01:01:56.226 --> 01:01:58.717
Get in the front!

01:02:05.803 --> 01:02:08.169
Hyah! Hyah!

01:02:08.238 --> 01:02:12.197
<i> Good boy! Come on!</i>
<i>Pull them round! Pull them round!</i>

01:02:15.646 --> 01:02:19.013
Nullah!
You're too close to the edge!

01:02:19.082 --> 01:02:22.051
<i>Courage, my boy! Courage!</i>

01:02:22.119 --> 01:02:25.054
Well done, my boy!

01:02:34.431 --> 01:02:37.923
<i>Nullah!</i>
<i>We have to turn the herd!</i>

01:02:47.277 --> 01:02:49.438
Hyah!

01:02:49.513 --> 01:02:51.447
Hey, hey!

01:02:51.515 --> 01:02:54.382
Never fear, Flynn is here!

01:02:54.451 --> 01:02:58.080
- Yeah, Flynn!
- Hyah!

01:03:14.638 --> 01:03:15.866
Flynn!

01:03:29.353 --> 01:03:30.911
Flynn!

01:03:35.859 --> 01:03:37.793
Nullah, run!

01:04:16.066 --> 01:04:17.829
Nullah!

01:04:51.868 --> 01:04:54.564
<i>Nullah!</i>

01:04:54.638 --> 01:04:56.663
<i>Nullah!</i>

01:04:56.740 --> 01:04:59.971
Oh! Oh.

01:05:02.879 --> 01:05:05.040
Oh.

01:05:05.115 --> 01:05:07.515
It's all right. You're safe.

01:05:09.119 --> 01:05:11.053
I've got you.

01:05:11.121 --> 01:05:13.715
You're safe.

01:05:13.790 --> 01:05:15.781
You're safe with me.

01:05:22.899 --> 01:05:24.890
I'll stay with you.

01:05:37.914 --> 01:05:40.212
Hey.

01:05:40.283 --> 01:05:42.979
How's the little fella?

01:05:43.053 --> 01:05:45.886
- Oh, he's fine. He's fine.
- Yeah.

01:05:47.391 --> 01:05:52.886
I have a feeling I might not be able
to complete the next lesson.

01:05:58.235 --> 01:06:01.261
Right, old mate.
I'm gonna get you some water, huh?

01:06:01.338 --> 01:06:06.571
Water's the last thing I want
at this moment in my life.

01:06:06.643 --> 01:06:11.205
Under the wagon-
a bottle of Poor Fella.

01:06:11.281 --> 01:06:15.047
I'm sorry, Drover. Just in case.

01:06:15.118 --> 01:06:18.884
Of course, mate. Of course.

01:06:18.955 --> 01:06:22.049
If you'd all share a drop.

01:06:23.326 --> 01:06:26.124
It would be a terrible shame
to waste it.

01:06:31.535 --> 01:06:35.403
The spear- Nullah told me.

01:06:37.507 --> 01:06:41.068
A glass-tipped spear.

01:06:41.144 --> 01:06:43.772
Tell milady I'm sorry.

01:06:45.615 --> 01:06:48.083
I was a coward.

01:07:31.962 --> 01:07:36.160
We lost just about everything,
except for a few swags and tins of beef.

01:07:36.233 --> 01:07:38.167
And this.

01:07:41.505 --> 01:07:45.202
I can't believe I was so insistent
upon bringing these...

01:07:45.275 --> 01:07:47.209
silly things.

01:07:48.945 --> 01:07:51.709
It was Fletcher who did this,
wasn't it?

01:07:53.683 --> 01:07:56.846
The last thing Flynn told me
before he died was that-

01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.821
<i>that your husband was killed by a-</i>

01:07:59.890 --> 01:08:02.051
by a glass-tipped spear...

01:08:02.125 --> 01:08:04.923
like the ornamental ones
in the homestead.

01:08:04.995 --> 01:08:08.431
<i>Glass-tipped is a Kimberley spear.</i>

01:08:08.498 --> 01:08:10.193
King George is from Arnhem.

01:08:10.267 --> 01:08:13.566
<i>Fletcher was trying to make it</i>
<i>look like King George.</i>

01:08:13.637 --> 01:08:17.368
- Fletcher.
- It can't be proved.

01:08:17.439 --> 01:08:19.374
<i>Sorry.</i>

01:08:22.078 --> 01:08:24.444
Maitland-

01:08:44.267 --> 01:08:46.462
We can't let them win.

01:08:47.938 --> 01:08:49.872
We won't.

01:09:02.852 --> 01:09:04.786
Get 'em up!

01:09:06.156 --> 01:09:08.920
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

01:09:32.314 --> 01:09:35.773
They pushed on during the night.

01:09:35.852 --> 01:09:38.742
Maybe that little creamy
has got the blackfella magic.

01:09:38.743 --> 01:09:39.582
Shut up, Bull!

01:09:41.457 --> 01:09:44.950
They're gonna need more than magic
to get 'em to Darwin.

01:09:55.005 --> 01:09:57.030
Hey, Nullah.

01:09:57.107 --> 01:10:00.304
Nullah, after you're done, I need you
to help hobble these horses. All right?

01:10:00.377 --> 01:10:02.311
Yes, boss.

01:10:04.681 --> 01:10:06.808
<i>I never thought I'd see this day.</i>

01:10:06.883 --> 01:10:10.649
- We're gonna break the Drover's law.
- I plenty old enough too!

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:14.520
Yes, you are, and that is why you
are gonna keep an eye on the rest of us.

01:10:14.591 --> 01:10:17.219
All right?

01:10:17.294 --> 01:10:19.990
- All right, everyone. Let's be upstanding.
- Good girl, Jedda. Here.

01:10:22.432 --> 01:10:24.195
To the memory of the gentleman.

01:10:24.267 --> 01:10:28.135
- To the gentleman.
- To Flynn!

01:10:42.385 --> 01:10:45.183
I'd say one more before dinner.

01:11:00.937 --> 01:11:02.871
- Let's dance.
- No.

01:11:02.939 --> 01:11:04.668
- Come on!
- No. No.

01:11:04.741 --> 01:11:07.073
Come on. Please?

01:11:07.143 --> 01:11:09.668
- No. I don't know how.
- It's easy. I'll show you.

01:11:09.746 --> 01:11:12.340
You put your hands on my shoulders.

01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:20.011
And you step back.

01:11:21.024 --> 01:11:23.584
- Back. No, no.
- Oh, back. Sorry.

01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:25.651
- I'm a bad teacher.
- Stop!

01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:27.890
You don't drink much, do you?

01:11:27.964 --> 01:11:29.898
No.

01:11:29.966 --> 01:11:33.959
<i>I'll give it a go. Come on.</i>
<i>I can do it. I can do it. All right?</i>

01:12:16.813 --> 01:12:19.577
<i>Now you do wrong-side business?</i>

01:12:19.649 --> 01:12:21.344
Uh-

01:12:21.418 --> 01:12:24.182
<i>No, mate. No.</i>
<i>We're just having a dance here.</i>

01:12:25.889 --> 01:12:30.019
- <i>Ceremonial dance?</i>
- Uh, yes. It's called the fox-trot.

01:12:30.093 --> 01:12:33.756
Fox dance?
You gonna teach me that dance?

01:12:33.830 --> 01:12:36.492
- Uh, you're a bit too young for her, mate.
- <i> Nullah!</i>

01:12:36.566 --> 01:12:40.662
Get down from that tree now!
Got bad spirits up there.

01:12:40.737 --> 01:12:43.205
You're in big trouble.

01:12:45.556 --> 01:12:48.635
<i> Come on, Nullah.</i>
<i>Time to go to bed now.</i>

01:12:48.711 --> 01:12:51.271
<i>You know better</i>
<i>than to go up in the tree.</i>

01:12:51.347 --> 01:12:54.475
<i>Have you ever fallen</i>
<i>into wrong-side business?</i>

01:12:56.986 --> 01:13:00.217
Uh, yeah.

01:13:01.224 --> 01:13:03.818
- Oh.
- Yeah. I was married once.

01:13:03.893 --> 01:13:07.056
- Really?
- Mmm. To a lovely girl.

01:13:10.567 --> 01:13:13.559
That was before I went off to war.

01:13:20.276 --> 01:13:22.210
And what happened?

01:13:25.648 --> 01:13:27.809
Well, I marched off
for Mother England...

01:13:27.884 --> 01:13:31.752
and by the time I came back,
she was sick...

01:13:31.821 --> 01:13:34.585
with T.B.

01:13:34.657 --> 01:13:39.617
But back then, the hospitals
wouldn't treat, um, blacks.

01:13:45.168 --> 01:13:48.137
Oh, right. I see. Yeah.

01:13:53.776 --> 01:13:55.767
Do you have children?

01:13:58.648 --> 01:14:01.583
- No.
- Well, that's a shame.

01:14:02.685 --> 01:14:05.051
I think you would have
made a great father.

01:14:08.191 --> 01:14:11.592
- You?
- No.

01:14:13.296 --> 01:14:15.856
I can't.

01:14:16.933 --> 01:14:18.560
Oh.

01:14:21.271 --> 01:14:23.262
That's too bad.

01:14:27.577 --> 01:14:29.909
You would have made a great mother.

01:14:38.087 --> 01:14:40.021
Well, good night.

01:14:42.225 --> 01:14:44.216
- Good night.
- Yeah.

01:15:17.327 --> 01:15:20.125
- Water no good, boss.
- No.

01:15:20.196 --> 01:15:21.925
Might be Carney boys
already been here, eh?

01:15:21.998 --> 01:15:24.660
There has to be water
some other place.

01:15:24.734 --> 01:15:26.759
- Next bore is five days.
- There has to be water.

01:15:26.836 --> 01:15:29.100
You can be sure Fletcher
will have been there as well.

01:15:31.374 --> 01:15:33.342
- <i>Hey, boss.</i>
- What?

01:15:33.409 --> 01:15:37.277
There's water three days' ride away.

01:15:37.347 --> 01:15:39.474
<i>We'd have to cross the Kuraman.</i>

01:15:39.549 --> 01:15:43.918
<i>The Kuraman?</i>
<i>That's Never-Never Land. No.</i>

01:15:43.987 --> 01:15:47.013
- We've got to try.
- We can't.

01:15:47.090 --> 01:15:49.354
- We've got to try.
- No one has drove the Never-Never.

01:15:49.425 --> 01:15:51.825
There's nothing to guide you.
You don't know where you are.

01:15:51.894 --> 01:15:55.796
You get caught out there,
you're gonna lose more than your cattle.

01:16:00.136 --> 01:16:02.900
I'm sorry.

01:16:04.774 --> 01:16:06.708
Boss!

01:16:06.776 --> 01:16:08.710
<i>Look!</i>

01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:40.534
<i>He a wizard.</i>
<i>He gonna sing for us.</i>

01:16:43.446 --> 01:16:45.277
Sing?

01:16:45.348 --> 01:16:48.181
He can find his way anywhere.

01:16:48.251 --> 01:16:51.687
<i>The ancestors created songs for everything.</i>

01:16:51.754 --> 01:16:54.723
<i>For every rock and tree.</i>

01:16:54.791 --> 01:16:59.023
<i>They're all linked,</i>
<i>so when</i> gulapa, <i>the magic man...</i>

01:16:59.095 --> 01:17:02.758
<i>sings them in order, he'll sing us to water.</i>

01:17:02.832 --> 01:17:04.959
<i>Even across the Never-Never.</i>

01:17:15.278 --> 01:17:17.610
<i>And we went on for three days.</i>

01:17:19.115 --> 01:17:22.846
<i>Every day drier-hotter.</i>

01:17:22.919 --> 01:17:25.251
<i>All that dead land.</i>

01:17:25.321 --> 01:17:28.313
<i>Then come that big dust storm.</i>

01:17:33.296 --> 01:17:35.594
Keep driving into the wind!

01:17:37.800 --> 01:17:39.825
<i>Nullah, stay close to me!</i>

01:17:39.902 --> 01:17:44.305
<i> Them cattle stop moving.</i>
<i>Magarri and Goolaj stop moving.</i>

01:17:44.373 --> 01:17:46.534
<i>We all stop moving.</i>

01:17:49.946 --> 01:17:52.847
I'm <i>gulapa.</i>

01:17:52.915 --> 01:17:56.476
I magic man. I wizard man.

01:18:10.366 --> 01:18:12.926
<i> Dead. All of them.</i>
<i>That's what he said.</i>

01:18:13.002 --> 01:18:15.994
<i>The pilot swooped down</i>
<i>to get a closer look.</i>

01:18:16.072 --> 01:18:19.405
Dead as doorposts they were.

01:18:19.475 --> 01:18:23.036
- It's a real tragedy.
- How terrible!

01:18:23.112 --> 01:18:25.103
<i>And on the eve of the ball too.</i>

01:18:25.181 --> 01:18:27.547
What were they doing in the Kuraman?

01:18:29.152 --> 01:18:31.120
<i>Nothing personal, Captain...</i>

01:18:31.187 --> 01:18:35.681
but I got a business to run,
and you got an army to feed.

01:18:35.758 --> 01:18:38.124
So let's not muck about.

01:18:40.930 --> 01:18:44.730
I suppose it's not a real war
unless someone's making a profit.

01:18:47.103 --> 01:18:50.300
- You got 'em ready to load, Neil?
- Yeah, we're right to go.

01:18:50.373 --> 01:18:54.332
'Cause I got a feeling the captain's
gonna put pen to paper.

01:18:54.410 --> 01:18:58.506
All hail the king. Yeah.

01:19:10.326 --> 01:19:13.056
<i> Where'd he come from?</i>

01:19:13.129 --> 01:19:15.495
Oh, look.

01:19:15.565 --> 01:19:18.932
Hello, little sweetie.

01:19:41.524 --> 01:19:44.357
What the bloody hell is that?

01:19:53.703 --> 01:19:55.864
Gentlemen!

01:19:57.640 --> 01:20:00.768
I'm Sarah Ashley,
owner of Faraway Downs.

01:20:00.843 --> 01:20:05.712
<i>We are making delivery of 1,500 head</i>
<i>of prime F.D. branded shorthorns.</i>

01:20:05.781 --> 01:20:08.443
<i>We will require a holding yard.</i>

01:20:08.517 --> 01:20:11.077
- We're full.
- Says who?

01:20:11.153 --> 01:20:14.554
- The owner.
- You must be Mr. Carney.

01:20:14.624 --> 01:20:16.854
Too right, love.

01:20:18.394 --> 01:20:20.419
<i>Lady Ashley, I'm Emmett Dutton.</i>

01:20:20.496 --> 01:20:22.487
I'm the officer in charge
of livestock purchases.

01:20:22.565 --> 01:20:27.468
We will accept 20% less than what
the Carney Cattle Company is asking.

01:20:27.536 --> 01:20:31.165
No can do, love.
You're late. The contract's signed.

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:35.074
This contract is not binding
until the cattle are loaded.

01:20:39.081 --> 01:20:40.349
Load the bloody cattle now!

01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:43.074
We've got to load the cattle
on the ship before Carney.

01:20:43.152 --> 01:20:45.985
- Get off your backsides!
- You drive 'em straight down the wharf.

01:20:46.055 --> 01:20:48.990
I'll try and keep Carney's cattle
in the yard.

01:20:52.795 --> 01:20:54.490
Load the bloody cattle now!

01:20:55.631 --> 01:20:58.998
- Drover!
- Hyah!

01:21:02.505 --> 01:21:04.632
Load!

01:21:08.577 --> 01:21:11.205
You blokes, load!

01:21:13.416 --> 01:21:16.044
Hyah!

01:21:16.118 --> 01:21:19.144
Hey, Bull!
Open the bloody crush!

01:21:19.221 --> 01:21:22.019
Come on!
Close that flamin' gate!

01:21:37.707 --> 01:21:39.368
You missed the boat, sunshine.

01:21:39.442 --> 01:21:42.741
<i>Yeah. Good luck, Drover, you drongo!</i>

01:21:42.812 --> 01:21:44.803
Over here, Drover.

01:21:56.625 --> 01:21:59.059
Hyah!

01:22:14.477 --> 01:22:17.002
<i>Drover!</i>

01:22:17.079 --> 01:22:19.809
Push 'em straight down the wharf!

01:22:22.318 --> 01:22:24.843
Hah!

01:22:24.920 --> 01:22:28.219
Hyah!

01:22:34.530 --> 01:22:36.964
Hyah!

01:22:39.435 --> 01:22:41.562
<i>Hyah!</i>

01:22:43.806 --> 01:22:47.105
<i> There are cattle being</i>
<i>driven down the wharf.</i>

01:22:47.176 --> 01:22:49.906
My husband must have
a problem with the loading.

01:22:49.979 --> 01:22:53.278
<i>They're not Carney cattle.</i>

01:22:55.551 --> 01:22:57.985
- Mmm?
- It's Lady Ashley.

01:23:00.623 --> 01:23:02.557
Get out of the way!

01:23:02.625 --> 01:23:05.093
<i>Looks like, uh,</i>
<i>we've got a bit of competition...</i>

01:23:05.161 --> 01:23:07.721
back in the meat business.

01:23:16.972 --> 01:23:19.338
Now that's it!

01:23:19.408 --> 01:23:22.138
Hyah! Ho!

01:23:29.718 --> 01:23:32.744
Ho! Push them up!

01:23:34.890 --> 01:23:38.951
- Hyah!
- Cheeky bulls down the wharf!

01:23:39.028 --> 01:23:41.656
Cheeky bulls down the wharf,
Mrs. Boss!

01:24:07.022 --> 01:24:09.889
- Hyah!
- <i>Get him down the wharf. That's it, Nullah.</i>

01:24:09.959 --> 01:24:13.053
<i>Get him up, Nullah.</i>

01:24:13.129 --> 01:24:16.360
I got the last big, bloody, cheeky bull
in the big, bloody metal ship.

01:24:16.432 --> 01:24:18.229
All right!

01:24:19.335 --> 01:24:22.702
<i>Yea! Yea!</i>

01:24:26.775 --> 01:24:29.903
Lady coming through.
There's a lady coming through.

01:24:34.049 --> 01:24:36.347
Two Poor Fella rums, Ivan.

01:24:36.418 --> 01:24:39.080
Shut up!

01:24:39.155 --> 01:24:42.147
No women.
Ladies' lounge next door.

01:24:44.727 --> 01:24:49.164
<i>She's no lady, Ivan. She just drove</i>
<i>a mob of cattle across the Never-Never.</i>

01:24:49.231 --> 01:24:52.530
She deserves a drink like any man.

01:24:52.601 --> 01:24:55.001
Too bloody right.

01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:57.937
Too bloody right.

01:25:09.418 --> 01:25:11.545
I never drink Poor Fella alone.

01:25:18.127 --> 01:25:21.722
Crikey!

01:25:21.797 --> 01:25:23.924
<i>One, two, three!</i>

01:25:23.999 --> 01:25:27.867
<i># Where's that jolly jumbuck</i>
<i>you've got in your tucker bag #</i>

01:25:27.937 --> 01:25:30.997
<i># You'll come a-Waltzing Matilda with me ##</i>

01:25:31.073 --> 01:25:34.236
I didn't want to see a single beast
from Faraway Downs...

01:25:34.310 --> 01:25:37.279
set a hoof on that wharf, Neil.

01:25:37.346 --> 01:25:40.474
But that's what happens
when you send a boy to do a man's job.

01:25:40.549 --> 01:25:43.143
Now, find out if she's going
to the ball tomorrow night.

01:25:43.219 --> 01:25:45.210
I'll take care of it myself.

01:25:57.233 --> 01:26:01.067
<i>So everybody get what they want.</i>

01:26:01.136 --> 01:26:03.127
<i>Everybody happy.</i>

01:26:03.205 --> 01:26:06.538
<i>Mrs. Boss is gonna sell Faraway Downs...</i>

01:26:06.609 --> 01:26:09.407
<i>and go back to England.</i>

01:26:09.478 --> 01:26:11.412
Shh.

01:26:11.480 --> 01:26:13.141
That's it. Good girl.

01:26:13.215 --> 01:26:16.651
<i>Drover, he get'em that horse,</i>
<i>Capricornia.</i>

01:26:16.719 --> 01:26:18.653
That's it. Good girl.

01:26:18.721 --> 01:26:22.157
<i>Everybody happy, except for me.</i>

01:26:24.994 --> 01:26:27.485
<i>'Cause I not white fella.</i>

01:26:27.563 --> 01:26:29.793
<i>I not blackfella either.</i>

01:26:29.865 --> 01:26:31.856
<i>Me half-caste.</i>

01:26:33.202 --> 01:26:35.796
<i>Creamy.</i>

01:26:35.871 --> 01:26:37.964
<i>Me belong no one.</i>

01:26:48.017 --> 01:26:50.383
Good girl.

01:26:50.452 --> 01:26:54.149
<i>Back, back, back. Back. Good.</i>

01:26:56.125 --> 01:27:01.563
<i>Easy, easy. Good, good. That's it.</i>

01:27:06.602 --> 01:27:09.537
That's a good girl. That's it.
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:27:10.873 --> 01:27:13.706
You really do have a gift with horses.

01:27:15.544 --> 01:27:18.377
Up. Up.

01:27:20.749 --> 01:27:22.341
You look different.

01:27:22.418 --> 01:27:27.117
I've agreed to be patroness at the ball
at Government House tomorrow night.

01:27:27.189 --> 01:27:29.157
Yeah? And?

01:27:30.225 --> 01:27:33.661
Drover, I-

01:27:33.729 --> 01:27:36.163
I'm going to finish
what Maitland set out to do...

01:27:36.231 --> 01:27:40.031
and I am going to bring
Faraway Downs back to life.

01:27:40.102 --> 01:27:42.070
I don't follow you.

01:27:42.137 --> 01:27:44.332
Well, this is perfect.
I'm going to need a manager.

01:27:46.775 --> 01:27:50.267
Well, I thought that...

01:27:50.346 --> 01:27:53.338
it would be a good job for you.

01:27:56.352 --> 01:27:58.877
Anyway, I almost forgot something.
I got a suit for you.

01:27:58.954 --> 01:28:02.014
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop. Don't do that.
- Do what?

01:28:02.091 --> 01:28:04.423
The thing you do
when you get a head full of ideas.

01:28:04.493 --> 01:28:07.394
- Like crossing the Kuraman?
- <i>Come on, mate.</i>

01:28:07.463 --> 01:28:11.797
You don't know what you're talking about.
Running a station? Manager?

01:28:11.867 --> 01:28:15.132
I'm a drover. All right?
No man hires me, no man fires me.

01:28:17.206 --> 01:28:19.800
- So you don't want to go to the ball?
- Ball?

01:28:22.444 --> 01:28:24.378
Sarah.

01:28:25.647 --> 01:28:28.980
I'm as good as black to that mob up there.

01:28:29.051 --> 01:28:33.317
I mix with dingoes, not- not duchesses.

01:28:35.290 --> 01:28:39.386
They keep out of my way,
and I keep out of theirs.

01:28:39.461 --> 01:28:41.452
That's the way it is.

01:28:41.530 --> 01:28:45.364
Just because it is
doesn't mean it should be.

01:28:51.774 --> 01:28:53.765
But that's the way it is.

01:29:04.486 --> 01:29:06.420
<i>Cheer up, little fella.</i>

01:29:06.488 --> 01:29:09.753
You and that Chinaman gonna take me out
on a big night at the pictures.

01:29:09.825 --> 01:29:11.759
How?

01:29:11.827 --> 01:29:14.352
<i>You can't take half-caste</i>
<i>to picture show.</i>

01:29:14.430 --> 01:29:18.799
- Coppers take him!
- He won't be half-caste.

01:29:18.867 --> 01:29:21.927
He got every right to be there.

01:29:23.038 --> 01:29:25.029
We use magic.

01:29:26.208 --> 01:29:28.972
You got every right to be there.

01:29:33.682 --> 01:29:36.480
'Cause you're a special boy.

01:29:36.552 --> 01:29:38.884
He's a special boy.

01:29:38.954 --> 01:29:42.685
<i>Nobody gonna stop you</i>
<i>from going. Nobody.</i>

01:29:42.758 --> 01:29:45.386
<i># Somewhere #</i>

01:29:45.461 --> 01:29:48.794
# Over the rainbow #

01:29:48.864 --> 01:29:53.858
#Way up high #

01:29:53.936 --> 01:29:59.067
<i># There's a land that I heard of#</i>

01:29:59.141 --> 01:30:02.304
<i># Once in a lullaby #</i>

01:30:04.112 --> 01:30:10.711
# Somewhere over the rainbow #

01:30:10.786 --> 01:30:14.586
# Skies are blue #

01:30:15.891 --> 01:30:18.587
<i># And the dreams #</i>

01:30:18.660 --> 01:30:21.652
<i># That you dare to dream #</i>

01:30:21.730 --> 01:30:26.667
<i># Really do come true ##</i>

01:30:31.907 --> 01:30:33.932
<i>How good of you, Lady Ashley...</i>

01:30:34.009 --> 01:30:37.274
to take an interest
in Dr. Barker's work on the mission.

01:30:37.346 --> 01:30:41.077
Well, actually, Administrator,
my interest is of a more personal nature.

01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:43.674
I must say, Lady Ashley-

01:30:43.752 --> 01:30:46.220
- Smashing.
- Would you excuse me?

01:30:46.288 --> 01:30:48.882
Amongst the leading lights of Darwin.

01:30:48.957 --> 01:30:51.858
I was wondering if you could
introduce me to Dr. Barker.

01:30:51.927 --> 01:30:53.918
- Sarah?
- Ah, Captain Dutton.

01:30:53.996 --> 01:30:57.397
Lady Ashley, I'll leave you
in the capable hands of the captain.

01:30:57.466 --> 01:31:00.697
I'm sure he would be happy
to introduce you to Dr. Barker.

01:31:00.769 --> 01:31:03.329
- I want to talk to you.
- Her husband barely in the grave...

01:31:03.405 --> 01:31:05.430
and there she is
cavorting with the captain.

01:31:05.507 --> 01:31:07.498
- His mother has passed away.
- And that dress.

01:31:07.576 --> 01:31:10.306
Yes.
Bidding should go through the roof.

01:31:10.379 --> 01:31:13.246
He is a little boy.
He needs someone to look after him.

01:31:13.315 --> 01:31:15.749
- Sarah-
- I'm desperate to speak to Dr. Barker.

01:31:15.817 --> 01:31:19.275
I'm going to adopt him. It's only a matter
of time before they take him away.

01:31:19.354 --> 01:31:22.687
Adopting an Aboriginal child is much
more complicated than you realize.

01:31:22.758 --> 01:31:26.489
Neil! Come on.
I want to talk with Lady Ashley.

01:31:26.562 --> 01:31:28.723
Yeah. No. We will later, love.

01:31:28.797 --> 01:31:32.198
I don't mind if you bid for her in
the auction tonight. I won't be jealous.

01:31:32.267 --> 01:31:36.431
- She's an inspiration.
- Yeah, she's full of surprises.

01:31:36.505 --> 01:31:39.531
But surely, Doctor, life on the station
with people who care for these children...

01:31:39.608 --> 01:31:42.304
is far better than life
on a government institution.

01:31:42.377 --> 01:31:44.777
Oh. The auction.

01:31:44.846 --> 01:31:47.974
Our gracious patroness, Lady Ashley!

01:31:48.050 --> 01:31:50.109
<i>Bravo!</i>

01:31:50.185 --> 01:31:52.176
<i>Now, for the auction of the first dance-</i>

01:31:52.254 --> 01:31:56.691
The mixed-race children must be dislocated
from the primitive, full-blood Aborigine.

01:31:56.758 --> 01:32:00.319
- Do I hear a first bid? Please.
- Five pounds here.

01:32:00.395 --> 01:32:03.262
- <i>Five pounds! </i>
- How else are we to breed the black out of them?

01:32:03.332 --> 01:32:07.428
I bid more than that for a dance with Mrs. Allsop!
Remember, it's for the mission.

01:32:07.502 --> 01:32:10.938
Has anyone asked their mothers
how they feel about this?

01:32:11.006 --> 01:32:13.975
- Lady Ashley, please.
- For the war effort, do I hear 20 pounds?

01:32:14.042 --> 01:32:17.842
It's a fact of science that the Aboriginal
mother soon forgets her offspring.

01:32:17.913 --> 01:32:21.872
- Fifty pounds!
- <i>Fifty pounds!</i>

01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:24.111
- Seventy pounds!
- Ninety-five!

01:32:24.186 --> 01:32:27.314
No mother forgets her child, Dr. Barker.

01:32:27.389 --> 01:32:30.449
- Lady Ashley!
- This is most inappropriate.

01:32:30.525 --> 01:32:32.686
100!

01:32:32.761 --> 01:32:36.857
- That is a new record.
- We can't very well ask their fathers, can we?

01:32:36.932 --> 01:32:39.730
- How dare you?
- Going once!

01:32:39.801 --> 01:32:43.134
- Or perhaps we should.
- Going twice!

01:32:43.205 --> 01:32:45.469
- <i>After all, they're right here in this room.</i>
- That's a lie!

01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:48.236
<i>500 quid!</i>

01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:54.380
<i>500 pounds!</i>

01:32:54.449 --> 01:32:57.145
<i>Well, indeed.</i>

01:32:57.219 --> 01:32:59.153
If it isn't the man who-

01:32:59.221 --> 01:33:01.746
<i>almost single-handedly...</i>

01:33:01.823 --> 01:33:04.189
<i>made the Australian beef industry...</i>

01:33:04.259 --> 01:33:07.422
<i>what it is today.</i>

01:33:07.496 --> 01:33:11.762
<i>Mr. King Carney</i>
<i>of the Carney Cattle Company.</i>

01:33:15.937 --> 01:33:19.168
For the benefit of the missions.

01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:26.072
<i>Well, there's nothing more to say...</i>

01:33:26.148 --> 01:33:28.946
but let the king take his prize.

01:33:35.190 --> 01:33:38.421
- <i>Can I get a picture, please? Smile.</i>
- Ah.

01:33:43.732 --> 01:33:46.166
Let me say, Lady Ashley,
just how sorry I was...

01:33:46.234 --> 01:33:48.668
to hear of your husband's death...

01:33:48.737 --> 01:33:51.262
at the hands of that wild savage.

01:33:51.339 --> 01:33:53.273
A savage, yes, Mr. Carney...

01:33:53.341 --> 01:33:58.244
but you and I both know that my husband
was not killed by an Aborigine.

01:33:58.313 --> 01:34:00.372
No, I did not know that.

01:34:00.449 --> 01:34:03.145
Perhaps you should ask Mr. Fletcher.

01:34:05.487 --> 01:34:09.287
- Are you making an accusation?
- Not one I can prove.

01:34:09.357 --> 01:34:12.554
In business, I've been fortunate.

01:34:12.627 --> 01:34:15.221
<i>In family, a little less so.</i>

01:34:15.297 --> 01:34:18.994
I'm prepared to go to 75,000 pounds.

01:34:19.067 --> 01:34:22.127
This is not about the money, Mr. Carney.
There is a little boy.

01:34:22.204 --> 01:34:24.570
There is a-

01:34:24.639 --> 01:34:28.507
There are people who are living-
living on the station...

01:34:28.577 --> 01:34:30.568
for whom I am responsible.

01:34:30.645 --> 01:34:32.510
And who will take care of them?

01:34:32.581 --> 01:34:36.278
A cattle station is like a country.

01:34:36.351 --> 01:34:39.912
And you have no one to look after it.

01:34:39.988 --> 01:34:42.320
Now, I can offer protection...

01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:47.089
to every man, woman and child.

01:34:47.162 --> 01:34:49.096
And child?

01:34:50.766 --> 01:34:52.996
You will do that?

01:34:53.068 --> 01:34:56.526
How can I keep you at your word?

01:34:56.605 --> 01:34:59.665
I'll put it in the contract.

01:34:59.741 --> 01:35:02.801
<i> King Carney and Lady Ashley.</i>
<i>That was a marvelous treat.</i>

01:35:05.213 --> 01:35:09.445
<i>No one can close a deal</i>
<i>more quickly than King Carney.</i>

01:35:10.519 --> 01:35:13.386
<i>Now, the raffle for the war effort.</i>

01:35:13.455 --> 01:35:16.049
The last flying boat...

01:35:16.124 --> 01:35:18.718
leaves tomorrow because of the war.

01:35:24.933 --> 01:35:28.994
Will I tell my lawyer
to draw up a contract?

01:35:29.070 --> 01:35:34.064
<i>But the true blue Australian man</i>
<i>like King Carney is-</i>

01:35:45.187 --> 01:35:47.155
Inform your lawyer-

01:35:47.222 --> 01:35:48.655
Uh-

01:36:06.741 --> 01:36:11.508
<i>Inform your lawyer that Faraway Downs</i>
<i>is no longer for sale.</i>

01:36:19.988 --> 01:36:21.922
Fox-trot!

01:36:55.323 --> 01:36:57.416
Here you are.

01:36:57.492 --> 01:37:01.155
Well, you didn't think I was gonna
waste my dance lesson, did you?

01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:07.130
Let's really give the bastards
something to talk about, huh?

01:37:07.202 --> 01:37:10.501
Oh, crikey.

01:37:13.241 --> 01:37:15.334
She's invited that man.

01:37:16.378 --> 01:37:18.608
- Hey, Doris.
- Get you a drink, Drover?

01:37:18.680 --> 01:37:21.615
Beer would be good.
Hello, love. Nice dress.

01:37:33.295 --> 01:37:35.559
- All right.
- Fox dance?

01:37:35.630 --> 01:37:37.621
- Fox dance.
- Mm-hmm.

01:37:39.367 --> 01:37:42.200
- Back. Back.
- Step.

01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:44.204
- Step.
- Sorry.

01:38:06.962 --> 01:38:08.953
Let's clear out of here.

01:38:24.446 --> 01:38:28.678
- There it is. First storm of the wet.
- Ahh.

01:38:30.585 --> 01:38:32.576
What's it like?

01:38:32.654 --> 01:38:34.212
It's beautiful.

01:38:34.289 --> 01:38:36.257
There's millions of birds.

01:38:36.324 --> 01:38:40.658
Creeks turn into rivers,
dry plains into lakes.

01:38:40.729 --> 01:38:44.426
Faraway Downs
will be reborn as an island-

01:38:44.499 --> 01:38:46.660
green and flowering
and fat with life.

01:38:46.735 --> 01:38:48.896
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Quick, quick, quick!

01:38:48.970 --> 01:38:51.461
We'll be cut off
from the rest of the world!

01:38:53.041 --> 01:38:55.407
- Sarah.
- Mm-hmm?

01:38:55.477 --> 01:38:58.412
In the dry- I'll be gone, droving.

01:39:08.289 --> 01:39:10.814
But right now it's raining.

01:39:31.046 --> 01:39:33.480
<i>Can you help me?
Can you help me?</i>

01:39:33.548 --> 01:39:35.607
<i>You don't need</i>
<i>to be helped any longer.</i>

01:39:35.683 --> 01:39:38.932
You've always had the power
to go back to Kansas.

01:39:38.933 --> 01:39:39.517
I have?

01:39:39.587 --> 01:39:41.555
But why didn't you tell her before?

01:39:41.623 --> 01:39:43.614
Because she wouldn't have believed me.

01:39:44.993 --> 01:39:47.052
My darling Cath!

01:39:47.128 --> 01:39:49.756
Daddy!

01:40:09.184 --> 01:40:11.118
Hey, Drover.

01:40:34.542 --> 01:40:36.510
Maitland Ashley met his death...

01:40:36.578 --> 01:40:40.275
at the hands of a wild savage, did he?

01:40:40.348 --> 01:40:43.545
You're not part of any plan
concerning this family.

01:40:43.618 --> 01:40:45.609
Nothing's in your name...

01:40:45.687 --> 01:40:49.817
and if anything should happen to
my darling Cath, you lose everything.

01:41:00.568 --> 01:41:04.231
There's no place like home.

01:42:41.869 --> 01:42:45.464
<i>Just like Drover say,</i>
<i>that rain make everything come alive.</i>

01:42:46.641 --> 01:42:49.201
<i>That land, it grow green and fat...</i>

01:42:49.277 --> 01:42:52.678
<i>and we all go back to Faraway Downs.</i>

01:42:53.982 --> 01:42:56.974
<i>Mrs. Boss happy. Drover happy.</i>

01:42:57.051 --> 01:43:00.111
<i>Even that copper Callahan happy.</i>

01:43:00.188 --> 01:43:02.782
<i>Mrs. Boss say he likes her tea so much...</i>

01:43:02.857 --> 01:43:06.122
<i>it gives him a blind eye-</i>

01:43:06.194 --> 01:43:08.458
<i>make me invisible, keep me safe.</i>

01:43:10.465 --> 01:43:12.456
<i>I hear for the first time...</i>

01:43:12.533 --> 01:43:14.763
<i>that thing called...</i>

01:43:14.836 --> 01:43:17.100
<i>Christmas.</i>

01:43:27.215 --> 01:43:30.309
<i>Then the rain, it stops.</i>

01:43:31.886 --> 01:43:35.822
<i>And that Drover, he go droving.</i>

01:43:38.459 --> 01:43:42.418
<i>That Mrs. Boss,</i>
<i>she always misses Drover.</i>

01:43:42.497 --> 01:43:45.660
<i>But I know he's gonna come back.</i>

01:43:54.876 --> 01:43:56.867
Whoo! Yeah!

01:44:01.449 --> 01:44:03.679
<i> King George</i>
<i>tell me you gotta be looking out.</i>

01:44:03.751 --> 01:44:08.313
<i>'Cause that croc,</i>
<i>he always watching, he always waiting.</i>

01:44:28.776 --> 01:44:30.835
Hah! Get up!

01:44:38.519 --> 01:44:41.079
<i>That Fletcher, he the new king now.</i>

01:44:50.965 --> 01:44:55.299
Emmett, why didn't you radio?
I'm so glad you're here.

01:44:55.370 --> 01:44:57.133
Would you get some tea, Bandy?

01:45:01.209 --> 01:45:03.541
<i>Geez, you done the place up nice.</i>

01:45:03.611 --> 01:45:06.808
I hope you don't mind.
Bandy let me in.

01:45:08.149 --> 01:45:11.585
My father would have been proud.

01:45:11.652 --> 01:45:13.586
It's bloody beautiful.

01:45:13.654 --> 01:45:17.488
<i>Geez, I bet you got all the mod cons.</i>

01:45:17.558 --> 01:45:19.958
What do you want?

01:45:22.130 --> 01:45:25.566
What I've always wanted-
Faraway Downs.

01:45:25.633 --> 01:45:27.567
Bandy, call the men.

01:45:27.635 --> 01:45:29.762
Bunchemup, Mr. Fletcher needs
to be escorted off the property-

01:45:29.837 --> 01:45:32.431
Callahan won't be having
any more cups of tea.

01:45:33.708 --> 01:45:35.767
I will though. Cup of tea.

01:45:35.843 --> 01:45:39.244
<i>Thanks, Bandy.</i>
<i>You know how I like it. Yeah.</i>

01:45:40.348 --> 01:45:43.078
It's all right, Bandy.

01:45:43.151 --> 01:45:45.517
<i>You know, these days,</i>
<i>I can pull a few strings.</i>

01:45:45.586 --> 01:45:48.282
I can probably bring your creamy in,
if you like.

01:45:48.356 --> 01:45:52.258
Or... I can talk to Dr. Barker
and get you guardianship.

01:45:52.326 --> 01:45:54.954
- I will never sell you my land.
- <i>Your land?</i>

01:45:55.029 --> 01:45:57.896
My family worked this property
for three generations.

01:45:57.965 --> 01:46:00.456
My father died
making people like you rich.

01:46:00.535 --> 01:46:02.765
<i>Faraway Downs belongs to me.</i>

01:46:05.139 --> 01:46:09.508
Just like... you believe
the little creamy belongs to you.

01:46:10.912 --> 01:46:13.142
<i>I'll pay you what it's worth.</i>

01:46:13.214 --> 01:46:16.980
Can use the money, go south,
get the little one an education.

01:46:17.051 --> 01:46:19.519
I'll go to the highest levels
of government, to the High Court.

01:46:19.587 --> 01:46:21.521
Beyond this country, if I have to.

01:46:21.589 --> 01:46:23.784
An unmarried woman,
living with the likes of the Drover?

01:46:23.858 --> 01:46:28.022
I will tell your wife he is your son!

01:46:28.095 --> 01:46:30.962
That would be a mistake.

01:46:34.802 --> 01:46:36.736
Kimberley spear.

01:46:38.739 --> 01:46:41.173
Glass-tipped.

01:46:42.643 --> 01:46:44.941
Real collector's items.

01:46:46.614 --> 01:46:50.812
<i>Oh! You're missing one.</i>

01:46:50.885 --> 01:46:54.480
<i>Anyway, I was just out here,</i>
<i>checking on all the properties.</i>

01:46:54.555 --> 01:46:57.820
Might do a little
buffalo hunting later. Yeah.

01:46:57.892 --> 01:47:00.122
Oh.

01:47:00.194 --> 01:47:03.129
Did you hear about the king?

01:47:03.197 --> 01:47:06.496
Terrible accident. Yeah.

01:47:06.567 --> 01:47:08.660
<i>Very dangerous place out here,</i>
<i>even for locals...</i>

01:47:08.736 --> 01:47:10.829
<i>like the Drover and the little creamy.</i>

01:47:10.905 --> 01:47:13.169
<i>You with me?</i>

01:47:13.241 --> 01:47:15.266
Anyway...

01:47:15.343 --> 01:47:18.369
you ought to think about it, Lady Ashley.

01:47:18.446 --> 01:47:22.280
After all, pride's not power.

01:47:30.057 --> 01:47:32.355
The Drover mustn't know.

01:47:33.461 --> 01:47:36.191
<i>Hyah! Hyah!</i>

01:47:36.264 --> 01:47:39.392
Drover! It's the Drover!

01:47:47.041 --> 01:47:48.975
Hey! Yah!

01:48:04.058 --> 01:48:06.117
Come on, you two! Wake up!

01:48:06.193 --> 01:48:08.491
Come on!

01:48:08.563 --> 01:48:11.464
- Come on. Wake up! We got brumbies to break.
- All right, all right.

01:48:23.844 --> 01:48:28.440
Yeah, break him. Ride that brumby!
Ride him! Ride him!

01:48:28.516 --> 01:48:33.920
Yea, Drover! Ride him!
Yeah, Drover! Drover!

01:48:35.823 --> 01:48:38.621
- You a man, Drover?
- Yeah, I try to be.

01:48:38.693 --> 01:48:41.253
Sometimes man
got to get away from woman.

01:48:41.329 --> 01:48:43.263
Maybe.

01:48:43.331 --> 01:48:46.459
- That's why you go droving.
- I go droving 'cause that's my job.

01:48:46.534 --> 01:48:49.435
If you don't go droving,
you not a man.

01:48:52.540 --> 01:48:54.974
All right, boys. That'll do.

01:48:55.042 --> 01:48:56.976
Bring 'em down
to the back paddock, will you?

01:48:57.044 --> 01:48:59.103
King George tell me
I gotta go walkabout.

01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:03.378
If I a man, I gotta go walkabout.
Learn'em be a man.

01:49:04.885 --> 01:49:06.819
Yeah.

01:49:06.887 --> 01:49:10.118
Listen, it's up to Mrs. Boss
what you do, all right?

01:49:10.191 --> 01:49:12.989
<i> Come on inside, boys.</i>
<i>It's time for dinner.</i>

01:49:13.060 --> 01:49:15.324
<i>I'm coming. Jedda, come on!</i>

01:49:15.396 --> 01:49:17.387
Come on, Jedda.

01:49:22.136 --> 01:49:25.435
<i>One day, Captain Dutton came and visit us.</i>

01:49:25.506 --> 01:49:28.771
<i>He tell Drover</i>
<i>about the big army drove.</i>

01:49:28.843 --> 01:49:29.724
<i>## </i>

01:49:29.725 --> 01:49:31.971
And we need
the best stockmen possible.

01:49:32.046 --> 01:49:35.345
- It may take six months or so.
- Overland.

01:49:35.416 --> 01:49:38.214
Absolutely not. You just got back.

01:49:46.227 --> 01:49:48.752
What's wrong?

01:49:48.829 --> 01:49:52.094
I'm just not used to people
making decisions for me. That's all.

01:49:52.166 --> 01:49:55.567
<i>I was just expressing an opinion.</i>

01:49:55.636 --> 01:49:58.537
Captain Dutton was telling me about
this wonderful School of the Air.

01:49:58.606 --> 01:50:01.734
It's conducted all across the country.

01:50:01.809 --> 01:50:04.573
He wants to go walkabout
with King George.

01:50:04.645 --> 01:50:07.671
That's ridiculous.
He's a little boy. It's not safe.

01:50:07.748 --> 01:50:11.878
<i>He'd be safer in Arnhem Land than</i>
<i>he would be hanging around here.</i>

01:50:11.952 --> 01:50:14.443
- I thought you said-
- <i>You can't change him, Sarah.</i>

01:50:16.123 --> 01:50:18.455
I thought you said
it had nothing to do with you.

01:50:18.526 --> 01:50:20.585
It doesn't.

01:50:20.661 --> 01:50:24.427
<i>It's just sooner or later,</i>
<i>you're gonna have to let that boy go.</i>

01:50:26.767 --> 01:50:29.031
<i>I don't know what you're talking about.</i>

01:50:29.103 --> 01:50:32.732
<i>If he doesn't go through ceremony,</i>
<i>he'll have no country.</i>

01:50:32.807 --> 01:50:35.435
He'll have no story, no dreaming.

01:50:37.144 --> 01:50:39.135
And he'll be all alone.

01:50:43.084 --> 01:50:45.575
<i>This big army drove-</i>

01:50:45.653 --> 01:50:48.713
- Let's have dinner, shall we?
- <i>I'm gonna take it.</i>

01:51:50.351 --> 01:51:53.013
Time to go walkabout, Mrs. Boss.

01:51:54.221 --> 01:51:57.850
- You belong here.
- No, Mrs. Boss.

01:52:33.427 --> 01:52:36.658
<i>Sarah, I gotta go.</i>

01:52:36.730 --> 01:52:38.664
Sarah!

01:52:40.134 --> 01:52:42.068
<i>Drover!</i>

01:52:43.437 --> 01:52:45.905
Drover!

01:52:48.642 --> 01:52:50.906
He's not down at the billabong!

01:52:50.978 --> 01:52:52.476
Then he's gone walkabout.

01:52:52.477 --> 01:52:55.711
He wouldn't have just left
without saying good-bye.

01:52:55.783 --> 01:52:58.684
Get the pack horse ready.
We're going up to Punctuation Point.

01:52:58.752 --> 01:53:00.686
- Sing Song?
- <i>Yes?</i>

01:53:00.754 --> 01:53:03.450
- Tin food. We're going after him.
- You're not listening.

01:53:03.524 --> 01:53:06.322
- What?
- <i>Sarah, he's gone on walkabout!</i>

01:53:06.393 --> 01:53:08.224
Oh, come on, Drover.
He is a child.

01:53:08.295 --> 01:53:12.755
Well, he's not our child!
He's an Aboriginal child! He's gone walkabout!

01:53:12.833 --> 01:53:15.063
- Bandy!
- <i>The next time you see him...</i>

01:53:15.135 --> 01:53:17.126
will be when he wants to see you.

01:53:17.204 --> 01:53:19.798
He'll be halfway to Arnhem Land by now.
You'll never find him.

01:53:19.874 --> 01:53:22.775
You could find him.
You know that land better than anyone.

01:53:22.843 --> 01:53:25.107
- You and Magarri can find him.
- <i>And do what, huh?</i>

01:53:25.179 --> 01:53:28.239
<i>Bring him back here and lock him up?</i>
<i>You could start your own mission.</i>

01:53:28.315 --> 01:53:31.773
Oh! You're just trying to be clever
because you don't want to be responsible.

01:53:31.852 --> 01:53:33.615
He's not my son!

01:53:36.257 --> 01:53:38.191
What did you say?

01:53:41.028 --> 01:53:44.259
- I better go.
- <i>Don't leave! Drover, don't.</i>

01:53:45.466 --> 01:53:47.991
I understood when you said
you had to be free.

01:53:48.068 --> 01:53:52.368
I understood that,
but that was between you and me.

01:53:52.439 --> 01:53:54.669
<i>But it's different now.</i>

01:53:54.742 --> 01:53:56.903
We've got Nullah.

01:53:58.412 --> 01:54:00.346
- I gotta go.
- I need you to stay.

01:54:00.414 --> 01:54:03.247
- I'll be back in six months.
- I need you to stay with me!

01:54:03.317 --> 01:54:05.444
And if you can't do that, then I-

01:54:05.519 --> 01:54:08.113
I would prefer it if you didn't return.

01:54:12.693 --> 01:54:14.661
All right.

01:54:14.728 --> 01:54:16.662
You're the boss.

01:54:20.567 --> 01:54:23.365
Drover.

01:54:34.214 --> 01:54:37.183
<i>I can feel them bad spirits coming...</i>

01:54:37.251 --> 01:54:40.186
<i>so I chase after that King George.</i>

01:54:40.254 --> 01:54:43.883
<i>But that Callahan,</i>
<i>he been stopped drinking Mrs. Boss's tea.</i>

01:54:48.963 --> 01:54:52.956
<i>He lose his blind eye,</i>
<i>and I not invisible anymore.</i>

01:54:59.606 --> 01:55:01.938
Jedda!

01:55:03.978 --> 01:55:06.503
Fletcher,
we've apprehended that young'un.

01:55:07.247 --> 01:55:12.378
<i>And in the course of our duties, we arrested</i>
<i>the suspected murderer of Lord Ashley.</i>

01:55:12.453 --> 01:55:14.045
<i>King George.</i>

01:55:21.061 --> 01:55:24.030
No!

01:55:25.399 --> 01:55:28.197
You finally lifted the game, Callahan.
Good on you.

01:55:28.268 --> 01:55:31.499
- Things are looking up.
- <i> The militarization of Darwin.</i>

01:55:31.572 --> 01:55:34.939
<i>Their cattle yards</i>
<i>are alive with military activity...</i>

01:55:35.009 --> 01:55:38.740
<i>and the Carney Cattle office,</i>
<i>once that proud icon of Darwin...</i>

01:55:38.812 --> 01:55:41.576
is now military headquarters.

01:55:41.648 --> 01:55:44.378
<i>At 6:15 a.m. local time...</i>

01:55:44.451 --> 01:55:48.410
the United States Pacific Fleet
was attacked at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii...

01:55:48.489 --> 01:55:50.855
by the empire of Japan.

01:55:50.924 --> 01:55:54.257
The United States has joined the war.

01:55:55.429 --> 01:55:58.398
As the Japanese horde pours southward...

01:55:58.465 --> 01:56:02.128
the final evacuation of Darwin
is under way.

01:56:10.277 --> 01:56:13.440
Get those boxes cleared on the double!

01:56:13.514 --> 01:56:15.345
- Come on.
- This way, boys.

01:56:15.416 --> 01:56:17.077
Quickly. Quickly.

01:56:35.736 --> 01:56:38.603
<i>Hey, creamy! Creamy!</i>

01:56:38.672 --> 01:56:41.300
<i>Doesn't your mommy want you?</i>

01:56:52.052 --> 01:56:54.520
- <i>You filthy creamy!</i>
- Come on.

01:56:54.588 --> 01:56:57.489
Come, my child.
Come on! Come on, my child.

01:56:57.558 --> 01:56:59.185
Creamy! Hey, creamy!

01:57:22.449 --> 01:57:23.814
- Excuse me.
- Nullah!

01:57:23.884 --> 01:57:25.511
- <i>Lady Ashley.</i>
- It's Lady Ashley.

01:57:25.586 --> 01:57:27.781
- Father Benedict, you deal with this.
- Nullah!

01:57:27.855 --> 01:57:30.517
- Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss!
- No! This is madness!

01:57:30.591 --> 01:57:33.492
Mrs. Boss, don't let them take me away!
I don't want to go!

01:57:33.560 --> 01:57:35.858
Was she hugging a pickaninny?

01:57:35.929 --> 01:57:37.988
People do the most extraordinary things.

01:57:38.065 --> 01:57:41.125
- Go on.
- I don't want to go! Mrs. Boss!

01:57:41.201 --> 01:57:41.876
It'll be all right.

01:57:41.877 --> 01:57:43.829
These poor unfortunates
will be safe in God's hands.

01:57:43.904 --> 01:57:46.338
These are not unfortunates!
These are children!

01:57:46.406 --> 01:57:49.375
These are no different than the children
you are taking south to protect!

01:57:49.443 --> 01:57:52.412
- Don't let them take me away! No!
- Nullah! Nullah!

01:57:52.479 --> 01:57:55.073
- She's humiliating herself.
- Please help me!

01:57:55.149 --> 01:57:57.242
- We've got to help her.
- Lady Ashley!

01:57:57.317 --> 01:58:00.081
- Help me! That's my child.
- I understand what you're saying.

01:58:00.154 --> 01:58:00.661
Please! Nullah!

01:58:00.662 --> 01:58:02.486
You don't have an essential job.
You must evacuate.

01:58:02.556 --> 01:58:06.322
- Mrs. Boss, don't let them take me away.
- The church has a plan for them.

01:58:06.393 --> 01:58:09.157
To leave those children behind
while we send ours to safety?

01:58:09.229 --> 01:58:11.857
- Control yourself, Catherine.
- How can you all be so heartless?

01:58:11.932 --> 01:58:14.833
You be a brave boy for me.
You be brave.

01:58:14.902 --> 01:58:18.463
Neil, I want you to do something about this.
I want you to help Lady Ashley.

01:58:18.539 --> 01:58:20.905
Yeah, now, look,
I could probably sort it out.

01:58:20.974 --> 01:58:23.704
Show the ladies their cabins,
and I'll see what I can do.

01:58:23.777 --> 01:58:25.335
<i>Come on, ladies.
To the upper decks.</i>

01:58:25.412 --> 01:58:27.403
I will come find you,
whatever happens.

01:58:27.481 --> 01:58:29.779
Whatever it takes,
we'll be together again. I promise.

01:58:29.850 --> 01:58:34.048
- I believe you, Mrs. Boss.
- Come along, child. Quickly. Quickly.

01:58:34.121 --> 01:58:36.055
Mrs. Boss.

01:58:37.457 --> 01:58:40.858
- I sing you to me.
- You be brave.

01:58:42.629 --> 01:58:45.257
- Nullah.
- Come, boy. Come quickly.

01:58:48.969 --> 01:58:51.631
Nullah! It'll be all right!

01:58:57.211 --> 01:59:00.203
<i>I will find you! I will!</i>

01:59:08.155 --> 01:59:11.386
<i>Nullah! Nullah!</i>

01:59:18.632 --> 01:59:21.624
I sing you to me, Mrs. Boss!

01:59:21.702 --> 01:59:24.762
And I will hear you, my darling!

01:59:30.877 --> 01:59:33.311
There's a radio tower on Mission Island...

01:59:33.380 --> 01:59:36.781
directly in the path
of the oncoming Japanese.

01:59:36.850 --> 01:59:39.341
Be the first place the Japs hit.

01:59:40.921 --> 01:59:42.855
You're monstrous.

01:59:46.893 --> 01:59:49.953
I'll have the original contract with
the original offer drawn up and ready.

01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:54.194
<i>You can get yourself a room at Ivan's,</i>
<i>and I'll get you a job with Cath at H.Q.</i>

01:59:54.268 --> 01:59:58.261
<i>I'll give you a call.</i>
<i>You will do this, Lady Ashley.</i>

01:59:58.338 --> 02:00:02.172
After all, pride's not power.

02:00:05.846 --> 02:00:08.974
Yeah, pride's not power.

02:00:39.212 --> 02:00:41.737
<i>Mission Island to H.Q.</i>

02:00:41.815 --> 02:00:45.046
Mission Island to H.Q.
Visibility good.

02:00:45.118 --> 02:00:48.087
<i>All clear. Over and out.</i>

02:00:49.823 --> 02:00:53.919
<i># Ave Maria #</i>

02:00:53.994 --> 02:00:58.192
<i> I was on Mission Island</i>
<i>lock-lock for two whole months.</i>

02:00:59.266 --> 02:01:03.202
<i>Mrs. Boss promised she'd come for me...</i>

02:01:03.270 --> 02:01:05.761
<i>so I play my magic song.</i>

02:01:10.277 --> 02:01:12.245
<i>But that Drover-</i>

02:01:12.312 --> 02:01:14.940
<i>him been gone far, far away...</i>

02:01:15.015 --> 02:01:17.415
<i>on that big army drove.</i>

02:01:18.518 --> 02:01:21.851
<i>Him been gone so long, so far away...</i>

02:01:21.922 --> 02:01:26.518
<i>maybe he not hear me.</i>

02:01:28.328 --> 02:01:32.094
Leave it off.

02:01:32.165 --> 02:01:34.292
What? No whistling?

02:01:34.368 --> 02:01:36.700
Just not that tune.

02:01:50.117 --> 02:01:52.585
<i>Not that one either.</i>

02:01:52.652 --> 02:01:55.052
<i>No music?</i>

02:01:55.122 --> 02:01:57.249
You must be properly hurtin'
for Mrs. Boss.

02:01:57.324 --> 02:01:59.258
Shut your damper hole, will ya?

02:01:59.326 --> 02:02:01.886
I can see why Mrs. Boss
gave you the boot.

02:02:01.962 --> 02:02:04.396
- You wanna know why she gave me the boot?
- Yeah.

02:02:04.464 --> 02:02:07.126
'Cause I wouldn't stop Nullah
from going walkabout.

02:02:07.200 --> 02:02:09.168
He went walkabout?

02:02:09.236 --> 02:02:11.761
Yeah. I tried to explain to her
what that means, but-

02:02:11.838 --> 02:02:14.636
- <i>See him go?</i>
- Nah.

02:02:14.708 --> 02:02:17.404
So he's gone.

02:02:17.477 --> 02:02:21.140
- Yeah. I told you. He went walkabout.
- You don't know?

02:02:21.214 --> 02:02:23.114
Eh?

02:02:23.183 --> 02:02:27.517
<i>That little fella, he could have walked</i>
<i>into a big hole or got eaten by a croc.</i>

02:02:27.587 --> 02:02:31.023
- What if the cops have got him?
- Don't you bloody start. He's an Aboriginal boy!

02:02:31.091 --> 02:02:36.495
Wait. You're just hiding behind that
blackfella business so you don't get hurt.

02:02:36.563 --> 02:02:39.031
<i>This isn't about walkabout, is it?</i>

02:02:39.099 --> 02:02:42.535
Is it? You're running.

02:02:43.737 --> 02:02:46.137
- I'm not running, mate.
- Yes, you are, brother.

02:02:48.208 --> 02:02:51.666
<i>You're scared of getting your heart hurt</i>
<i>like before, when my sister died.</i>

02:02:54.981 --> 02:02:58.109
<i>But knowing you, you probably never</i>
<i>told Mrs. Boss that you loved her, eh?</i>

02:03:00.253 --> 02:03:03.313
You got no love in your heart...

02:03:03.390 --> 02:03:05.381
<i>you got nothing.</i>

02:03:09.029 --> 02:03:11.998
<i>No dreaming, no story.</i>

02:03:13.066 --> 02:03:15.034
Nothing.

02:03:25.512 --> 02:03:27.912
<i>Hey. Big mob of army fellas.</i>

02:03:30.617 --> 02:03:33.085
Must be diggers, eh?

02:03:33.153 --> 02:03:36.088
<i>They're not diggers, mate.</i>
<i>They're Yanks.</i>

02:03:36.156 --> 02:03:38.624
What the bloody hell are they doing here?

02:04:11.958 --> 02:04:13.892
Once you've signed the contract...

02:04:13.960 --> 02:04:17.225
I'll get one of the brothers to take you
out to the mission on the sloop.

02:04:17.297 --> 02:04:21.290
You can be happily reunited
with your little creamy.

02:04:21.368 --> 02:04:23.928
No loss of pride, Lady Ashley.

02:04:28.041 --> 02:04:30.475
<i>Good morning, Ivan!</i>

02:04:33.446 --> 02:04:37.883
- You look happy.
- I am. I get my little boy today.

02:04:37.951 --> 02:04:41.614
Oh, and, Ivan, we're leaving
the territory tomorrow.

02:04:41.688 --> 02:04:44.919
Good! I need the room.

02:04:44.991 --> 02:04:47.459
I'll miss you too, Ivan!

02:05:19.225 --> 02:05:22.217
- Cath, sorry I'm late.
- Quick changeover, girls.

02:05:23.229 --> 02:05:25.595
- Did you speak to Neil?
- Yes.

02:05:25.665 --> 02:05:28.259
I'm seeing him about Nullah
after my shift.

02:05:28.335 --> 02:05:30.826
- Look. I was just thinking-
- What?

02:05:30.904 --> 02:05:33.304
About Nullah.

02:05:33.373 --> 02:05:35.807
What?

02:06:05.372 --> 02:06:07.431
I'm getting a signal from Mission Island.

02:06:07.507 --> 02:06:10.738
Large air formation bearing down.
Suspect visibility.

02:06:28.728 --> 02:06:32.425
If you can't understand the ordnance...

02:06:32.499 --> 02:06:34.490
how can you understand the order?

02:06:49.516 --> 02:06:51.916
What's happening?

02:06:58.458 --> 02:07:01.188
<i>We're under attack!</i>
<i>We're under attack!</i>

02:07:08.835 --> 02:07:11.201
Hurry up!

02:07:20.346 --> 02:07:21.904
Let them free!

02:08:42.695 --> 02:08:47.826
<i>Drover! Hey! Drover! Magarri!</i>

02:08:47.901 --> 02:08:52.304
Goolaj, where's Mrs. Boss?

02:08:52.372 --> 02:08:55.864
She at that army H.Q. - old Carney place!

02:08:55.942 --> 02:08:58.467
Okay. Come on!

02:09:00.246 --> 02:09:02.214
Drover,
I'll see you at Faraway Downs!

02:09:05.919 --> 02:09:10.015
You can't go in there, mate!

02:09:14.894 --> 02:09:17.522
- Drover!
- Callahan?

02:09:17.597 --> 02:09:19.724
<i>Is she in there? Sarah Ashley.</i>

02:09:19.799 --> 02:09:22.063
- It's too late.
- She's in there!

02:09:22.135 --> 02:09:24.126
Hold it, mate!

02:09:25.271 --> 02:09:29.537
Let me in there! Sarah! Sarah!

02:09:29.609 --> 02:09:32.908
Let me in there!

02:09:32.979 --> 02:09:36.210
I'll handle this. You get your man
out of here right now!

02:09:36.282 --> 02:09:38.716
- She's a part of dreaming now.
- Get out of my way!

02:09:38.785 --> 02:09:40.252
- Go on! Hit me!
- Get out of my-

02:09:40.320 --> 02:09:43.016
Go on! Hit me!
It's not gonna bring her back.

02:09:43.089 --> 02:09:44.784
She's in there! Sarah!

02:09:44.858 --> 02:09:47.588
Clear the corridor! Come on!

02:09:47.660 --> 02:09:50.925
Nobody past this point unless they're
at death's door or already through it.

02:09:50.997 --> 02:09:52.965
<i>You got a name?</i>

02:09:53.032 --> 02:09:55.626
Ashley. Sarah Ashley.

02:10:00.206 --> 02:10:02.140
What did he say?

02:10:40.914 --> 02:10:43.576
<i>But right now it's raining.</i>

02:10:44.851 --> 02:10:48.617
<i>It's different now.</i>
<i>We've got Nullah.</i>

02:10:51.257 --> 02:10:53.248
<i>Here you are.</i>

02:11:06.406 --> 02:11:08.636
<i>She deserves a drink like any man.</i>

02:11:10.710 --> 02:11:12.701
- <i> Too bloody right.</i>
- <i> Crikey!</i>

02:11:18.785 --> 02:11:21.379
Hey, no boongs in here.

02:11:36.836 --> 02:11:38.827
You didn't say that, did you?

02:11:38.905 --> 02:11:41.465
That's how it is.

02:11:42.775 --> 02:11:44.766
Just because it is...

02:11:46.746 --> 02:11:49.738
doesn't-
doesn't mean it should be.

02:11:53.386 --> 02:11:55.479
Serve him a fuckin' drink!

02:12:20.947 --> 02:12:23.711
Ah, what does it matter?

02:12:25.151 --> 02:12:27.176
I'm a total bloody ruin.

02:12:27.253 --> 02:12:30.689
<i>I'm evacuating south,</i>
<i>like everybody else.</i>

02:12:30.757 --> 02:12:32.918
You're short one glass.

02:12:37.497 --> 02:12:41.365
<i>One... more... glass.</i>

02:12:49.175 --> 02:12:53.236
I leave this place
for the looters and the Japs.

02:12:58.651 --> 02:13:00.642
Why not the boongs?

02:13:17.370 --> 02:13:20.533
<i>I saw her this morning...</i>

02:13:20.606 --> 02:13:22.574
<i>before she went to the work.</i>

02:13:22.642 --> 02:13:24.633
<i>She was so happy.</i>

02:13:26.012 --> 02:13:28.810
She was gonna get that...

02:13:28.881 --> 02:13:32.078
<i>little boy and go south.</i>

02:13:33.486 --> 02:13:35.647
What about the children
on Mission Island?

02:13:35.721 --> 02:13:40.215
<i>The creamies?</i>
<i>They are left out there.</i>

02:13:40.293 --> 02:13:44.161
- They left them out there?
- Safe in the hands of God.

02:13:44.230 --> 02:13:46.528
They left them-

02:13:46.599 --> 02:13:49.193
<i>They say the island was hit first.</i>

02:13:49.268 --> 02:13:52.260
<i>They say no one would have survived.</i>

02:13:57.410 --> 02:14:00.208
They say a lot of things.

02:14:03.116 --> 02:14:05.107
<i>There's been some mistake.</i>

02:14:06.219 --> 02:14:08.210
That's Cath Fletcher.

02:14:09.422 --> 02:14:11.481
Oh, God. Cath.

02:14:11.557 --> 02:14:14.890
- Oh, God!
- Sort her out.

02:14:14.961 --> 02:14:17.896
- Sarah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- Oh, God!

02:14:17.964 --> 02:14:20.125
Nullah. I've got to get to Nullah.

02:14:20.199 --> 02:14:22.963
- Sarah, the Japs hit the mission first.
- No!

02:14:23.035 --> 02:14:26.027
- No! I don't believe you! I don't believe it!
- Sarah, look at me.

02:14:26.105 --> 02:14:28.096
No one can get out there.

02:14:32.378 --> 02:14:36.041
No one.

02:14:37.216 --> 02:14:39.150
<i>I need help to get to the island.</i>

02:14:39.218 --> 02:14:42.187
- Half the Jap navy's out there, you stupid bastard.
- I have the Lord on my side.

02:14:42.255 --> 02:14:44.815
I don't give a damn who's on your side!

02:14:46.926 --> 02:14:49.588
God works in mysterious ways, Brother.
Go, go, go!

02:14:49.662 --> 02:14:51.323
<i>Magarri, secure the boat.</i>

02:14:51.397 --> 02:14:53.763
- <i>Thank you, Lord. Thank you.</i>
- Thank you, Bull.

02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:04.773
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

02:15:09.415 --> 02:15:12.907
Sarah, we leave at first light.

02:15:33.105 --> 02:15:34.902
Ivan.

02:15:34.974 --> 02:15:38.307
- Check the second dormitory.
- Okay.

02:16:15.848 --> 02:16:17.782
Nullah.

02:16:22.154 --> 02:16:24.088
Oh.

02:16:49.882 --> 02:16:52.111
Come on. It's all right.

02:16:53.718 --> 02:16:56.153
- Shh.
- Where are the other-Are there other boys?

02:16:56.222 --> 02:16:58.213
- I don't know.
- <i>Are there any other boys?</i>

02:16:58.290 --> 02:17:00.781
- <i>I don't know.</i>
- Okay.

02:17:00.860 --> 02:17:02.851
Drover?

02:17:04.864 --> 02:17:07.799
- Nullah.
- Drover!

02:17:09.934 --> 02:17:12.802
<i>Drover!</i>

02:17:12.871 --> 02:17:15.340
I knew you'd come.
I sing you to me.

02:17:15.407 --> 02:17:17.342
Oh.

02:17:20.446 --> 02:17:23.005
- Magarri!
- Hey, little fella.

02:17:29.655 --> 02:17:32.021
Mrs. Boss come too?

02:17:32.091 --> 02:17:34.321
Where's Mrs. Boss?

02:17:34.393 --> 02:17:36.384
We, uh-

02:17:36.462 --> 02:17:39.727
We can't say her name anymore,
little mate.

02:17:43.068 --> 02:17:45.230
All right?

02:17:45.304 --> 02:17:48.397
Hey. Now you listen to me.
I need your help.

02:17:48.474 --> 02:17:50.532
I'm gonna get these fellas
off the island.

02:17:50.609 --> 02:17:52.941
You're gonna have to be strong.
Can you do that?

02:17:53.012 --> 02:17:55.003
- Mm-hmm.
- Good boy.

02:17:56.281 --> 02:17:59.342
All right. Go and get
your little mates down there.

02:17:59.418 --> 02:18:02.182
- Come over here. Let's go.
- Come with me. It's okay.

02:18:02.254 --> 02:18:05.712
- <i>Come on.</i>
- We're gonna get you all off this island, all right?

02:18:05.790 --> 02:18:08.089
All right.
Boys, we're gonna have to swim.

02:18:08.160 --> 02:18:11.925
We have to be quiet, like a turtle.
Okay?

02:18:11.996 --> 02:18:15.262
<i>Now, I'm gonna take you home on a ship.</i>
<i>It's over there. You see it?</i>

02:18:25.611 --> 02:18:27.909
Let's go, boys! Let's go!

02:18:27.980 --> 02:18:29.914
Quick, quick, quick!

02:18:30.950 --> 02:18:32.884
Ivan.

02:18:34.186 --> 02:18:36.677
- Ivan. Swim the big boys down to the sloop.
- Right.

02:18:36.755 --> 02:18:40.089
Use the current and drift it
down to the end of the wharf. Go.

02:18:40.159 --> 02:18:42.992
Come on, boys. Quick.

02:18:43.062 --> 02:18:45.257
Run! Run!

02:18:45.331 --> 02:18:47.764
Quick, quick!

02:18:47.833 --> 02:18:49.767
<i>Let's go.</i>

02:19:01.414 --> 02:19:03.974
Ah, crikey.

02:19:09.688 --> 02:19:12.748
Hey.

02:19:14.927 --> 02:19:17.486
- I take this mob walkabout.
- You'll never make it.

02:19:17.563 --> 02:19:19.531
Well, you gotta make it!

02:19:19.598 --> 02:19:22.294
You got family now.

02:19:22.368 --> 02:19:24.598
You gotta drove this mob home, Drover.

02:19:30.209 --> 02:19:32.769
Good luck, brother.

02:19:35.548 --> 02:19:37.448
- Go, go.
- That's it. Good boy.

02:20:17.890 --> 02:20:18.879
Magarri.

02:20:24.230 --> 02:20:26.994
<i>Up the ladder, boys. Quick. Hurry now.</i>

02:20:34.773 --> 02:20:36.400
Come on.

02:21:19.919 --> 02:21:21.910
Drove 'em home, Drover.

02:22:08.767 --> 02:22:10.701
Sergeant, get the men on the trucks.

02:22:10.769 --> 02:22:13.670
<i>We're evacuating within 15 minutes.</i>

02:22:13.739 --> 02:22:18.005
<i>We rendezvous with the main convoy</i>
<i>at 0800 hours at Adelaide.</i>

02:22:19.011 --> 02:22:21.104
<i>Start the truck, Sergeant Lapin.</i>

02:22:22.381 --> 02:22:25.475
<i>If anyone is lagging,</i>
<i>use whatever force is necessary.</i>

02:22:25.551 --> 02:22:28.076
Every single man, Lapin.
And don't take no for an answer.

02:22:28.153 --> 02:22:33.181
- <i>You won't have to wait for us, Captain.</i>
- Move! Come on! Move!

02:22:33.258 --> 02:22:36.386
Thanks for coming down, Mr. Fletcher.

02:22:36.462 --> 02:22:38.521
It's my awful duty to inform you...

02:22:38.597 --> 02:22:40.758
<i>that your wife, Catherine-</i>

02:22:43.135 --> 02:22:45.467
My wife is dead?

02:22:45.537 --> 02:22:49.564
<i>It's a funny old world, isn't it?</i>

02:22:49.642 --> 02:22:51.633
Generous to a fault.

02:22:51.710 --> 02:22:56.044
<i>Did you know that Lady Ashley insisted...</i>

02:22:56.115 --> 02:22:58.106
that my wife work her shift...

02:23:00.619 --> 02:23:06.421
so that she could see
some... half-caste kid on the mission?

02:23:06.492 --> 02:23:08.653
<i>Now my wife's dead.</i>

02:23:10.596 --> 02:23:12.860
Now I've lost everything.

02:23:24.343 --> 02:23:26.402
<i>We have to go, Sarah.</i>

02:23:40.192 --> 02:23:43.787
Come on! Come on, boys!

02:23:46.198 --> 02:23:48.792
They'll be flying in here
and blowing us up any minute!

02:23:48.867 --> 02:23:50.926
<i>Get on the bloody trucks!</i>

02:24:08.620 --> 02:24:12.454
<i>Sarah, please. We have to go now.</i>

02:24:19.331 --> 02:24:21.822
<i>My magic not good.</i>

02:24:21.900 --> 02:24:23.834
<i>All the smoke.</i>

02:24:25.738 --> 02:24:28.002
<i>But then he speak to me.</i>

02:24:28.073 --> 02:24:32.737
<i>Grandfather.</i>

02:24:54.600 --> 02:24:57.160
Come on, love. Don't muck about.

02:25:06.111 --> 02:25:08.045
Can you hear that?

02:25:09.481 --> 02:25:11.449
<i>Music. Can you hear it?</i>

02:25:11.517 --> 02:25:13.781
Come on, boys.

02:25:20.926 --> 02:25:22.951
Sing.

02:25:26.732 --> 02:25:28.723
- <i>Sarah, please.</i>
- Can't you hear it?

02:25:38.477 --> 02:25:40.707
It's children singing.

02:26:03.368 --> 02:26:06.997
- <i>Sarah! What's going on?</i>
- Just give her another minute.

02:26:33.665 --> 02:26:36.133
Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss!

02:26:37.970 --> 02:26:40.939
Mrs. Boss!

02:26:43.141 --> 02:26:46.042
Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss!

02:26:49.348 --> 02:26:51.612
Mrs. Boss! Mrs. Boss!

02:26:57.222 --> 02:26:59.087
Nullah!

02:26:59.157 --> 02:27:01.648
- Mrs. Boss!
- Ah!

02:27:01.727 --> 02:27:05.163
- I can say your name!
- Oh!

02:27:05.230 --> 02:27:09.291
Mrs. Boss. I sing you to me
like the first night I see you.

02:27:09.368 --> 02:27:12.599
Them Japs nearly got us.
We had to swim'em.

02:27:12.671 --> 02:27:16.334
Some of them little fellas
from the desert can't swim'em.

02:27:16.408 --> 02:27:20.344
But the Drover take 'em
on his back like a turtle.

02:27:21.480 --> 02:27:24.813
What did you say? What?

02:27:24.883 --> 02:27:26.817
Drover.

02:27:54.413 --> 02:27:57.177
You're alive! Oh, God!

02:28:26.278 --> 02:28:28.838
Sarah, what's going on?
I can't hold the sergeant any longer!

02:28:32.818 --> 02:28:35.912
Come on, boys!

02:28:35.988 --> 02:28:38.980
Oh, my God.
It's the children from the mission.

02:28:39.057 --> 02:28:41.187
The last convoy leaves Darwin
in a matter of minutes.

02:28:41.188 --> 02:28:41.582
Come on!

02:28:41.660 --> 02:28:43.594
- In the truck!
- Come on, boys!

02:28:43.662 --> 02:28:45.687
- To the truck. Follow Brother Frank.
- Truck's waiting. Let's go.

02:28:45.764 --> 02:28:47.493
Follow Brother Frank.
Follow Brother Frank.

02:28:47.566 --> 02:28:49.500
- <i>That's it. That's it.</i>
- Come on, boys. Come on, boys.

02:28:49.568 --> 02:28:51.832
- Let's go.
- <i>Come on, boys.</i>

02:28:51.903 --> 02:28:55.270
<i> Quick as you can to the end of</i>
<i>the wharf, and then straight on the truck.</i>

02:28:55.340 --> 02:28:58.275
- <i>Sarah.</i>
- Ivan!

02:28:58.343 --> 02:29:00.573
Thank you!

02:29:04.082 --> 02:29:06.516
Thank you.

02:29:06.585 --> 02:29:08.985
I shall prepare your bill.

02:29:14.026 --> 02:29:16.051
Where'd you come from?

02:29:16.128 --> 02:29:19.586
The good Lord has delivered us,
but we could do with a ride, Sergeant.

02:29:19.664 --> 02:29:22.030
I'm not Jesus Christ,
but I'll give it my best shot.

02:29:22.100 --> 02:29:24.193
Come on, kids.
Come on. On the trucks.

02:29:24.269 --> 02:29:26.965
<i>I want a third in the front,</i>
<i>a third at the back.</i>

02:29:27.039 --> 02:29:29.940
<i>Come on. Leg 'em up.</i>
<i>They're little fellas. Come on.</i>

02:29:30.008 --> 02:29:32.943
<i>Bring those little fellas up to the front.</i>

02:29:33.011 --> 02:29:35.980
<i>You cursed me, you little creamy.</i>

02:29:36.048 --> 02:29:39.142
Oh. Oh.

02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:44.216
When I said that no one
could get out there...

02:29:44.289 --> 02:29:46.280
<i>I'd forgotten about you, Drover.</i>

02:29:46.358 --> 02:29:50.294
<i>That no matter.</i>
<i>We gonna go back Faraway Downs.</i>

02:29:51.997 --> 02:29:55.262
Yes, he's right. With the water up,
it's the safest place in the north.

02:29:56.334 --> 02:29:58.495
<i>These are, after all-</i>

02:29:58.570 --> 02:30:01.903
Extraordinary circumstances.

02:30:03.475 --> 02:30:06.342
Extraordinary circumstances.

02:30:06.411 --> 02:30:09.005
Thank you, Emmett.

02:30:14.953 --> 02:30:17.421
I'll see you mob in Faraway Downs.

02:30:26.264 --> 02:30:30.132
Here, fellas, make some room
for the kids, will ya?

02:30:30.202 --> 02:30:32.466
- Can you help me, please?
- In you go.

02:30:33.805 --> 02:30:35.966
Right-o! That's it. They're all on.

02:30:36.041 --> 02:30:38.805
Let's get out of here.
Come on. Let's go.

02:30:40.345 --> 02:30:42.836
All right, kids, hold on.

02:30:47.786 --> 02:30:49.981
Mr. Fletcher!

02:30:51.389 --> 02:30:53.380
Mr. Fletcher.

02:30:53.458 --> 02:30:55.619
Neil.

02:30:55.694 --> 02:30:57.525
<i>We gotta go.</i>

02:31:00.532 --> 02:31:03.467
Go and tell Callahan
there's looters everywhere.

02:31:05.203 --> 02:31:08.331
Go and tell Callahan!

02:31:14.112 --> 02:31:17.206
- I've got the keys to the car upstairs.
- Right-o.

02:31:21.386 --> 02:31:23.217
Come on, Mrs. Boss. Hurry up.

02:31:36.334 --> 02:31:37.699
Nullah!

02:31:42.107 --> 02:31:45.736
<i>I got</i> gulapa <i>magic.</i>
<i>No one can hurt me.</i>

02:31:45.810 --> 02:31:48.074
- <i> Nullah! No!</i>
- No!

02:31:55.687 --> 02:31:58.588
<i>No! No!</i>

02:32:09.501 --> 02:32:12.470
Nullah!

02:32:12.537 --> 02:32:16.064
Nullah, you all right, little man?
Nullah, please. Come on. Please.

02:32:17.809 --> 02:32:19.743
Come on.

02:32:22.113 --> 02:32:24.104
There. That's it.

02:32:26.718 --> 02:32:29.414
No bullet. Me <i>gulapa.</i>

02:33:04.990 --> 02:33:06.924
<i>King George teach me...</i>

02:33:06.992 --> 02:33:11.122
<i>the rain will fall,</i>
<i>the grass grow green...</i>

02:33:11.196 --> 02:33:14.859
<i>and life, it begin again.</i>

02:33:20.605 --> 02:33:23.073
Let's go home.

02:33:23.141 --> 02:33:25.200
There's no place like it.

02:34:08.219 --> 02:34:10.915
<i>One thing I know.</i>

02:34:10.989 --> 02:34:14.254
Why <i>we tell story</i>
<i>is the most important of all.</i>

02:34:15.960 --> 02:34:18.827
<i>That's how you keep them people</i>
<i>belong you...</i>

02:34:18.897 --> 02:34:21.457
<i>always.</i>

02:35:10.815 --> 02:35:12.749
Oh.

02:35:27.866 --> 02:35:31.666
Mrs. Boss, I sing you to me.

02:35:58.730 --> 02:36:00.664
Here.

02:36:57.922 --> 02:37:00.516
And I will hear you.

02:38:06.791 --> 02:38:10.659
<i># Sing and I will hear you #</i>

02:38:10.728 --> 02:38:13.754
<i># No matter where you are #</i>

02:38:14.899 --> 02:38:18.835
<i># A song to light the darkest night #</i>

02:38:18.903 --> 02:38:22.805
<i># And guide me from afar#</i>

02:38:22.874 --> 02:38:26.105
<i># And I will never#</i>

02:38:26.177 --> 02:38:29.510
<i># Be afraid #</i>

02:38:29.581 --> 02:38:33.381
<i># Now I know you're somewhere #</i>

02:38:33.451 --> 02:38:36.852
<i># You're everywhere to me #</i>

02:38:39.657 --> 02:38:42.285
<i># The warming of the sun #</i>

02:38:42.360 --> 02:38:47.297
<i># Upon the earth beneath my feet #</i>

02:38:47.365 --> 02:38:50.960
<i># And when the rain falls down #</i>

02:38:51.035 --> 02:38:55.028
<i># You tell the story #</i>

02:38:55.106 --> 02:38:59.475
<i># And I will hear you #</i>

02:38:59.544 --> 02:39:02.672
<i># Always near you #</i>

02:39:02.747 --> 02:39:06.239
<i># By the Boab tree ##</i>

02:39:28.940 --> 02:39:33.502
<i> # From the sunburnt plains</i>
<i>of far-off north Australia #</i>

02:39:34.846 --> 02:39:39.146
<i># Came a fella born to ride</i>
<i>the wide, brown land #</i>

02:39:40.652 --> 02:39:43.450
<i># Oh, he grew up running wild #</i>

02:39:43.521 --> 02:39:46.354
<i># But soon by all was styled #</i>

02:39:46.424 --> 02:39:50.690
<i># As the country's greatest</i>
<i>ever-drovin' man #</i>

02:39:52.296 --> 02:39:56.630
<i># Though his legend rode the winds</i>
<i>from Broome to Darwin #</i>

02:39:58.002 --> 02:40:03.372
<i># They loved and loathed him</i>
<i>right from end to end #</i>

02:40:03.441 --> 02:40:06.274
<i># For when the Drover gave his heart #</i>

02:40:06.344 --> 02:40:09.074
<i># To a girl whose skin was dark #</i>

02:40:09.147 --> 02:40:14.813
<i># From that day on</i>
<i>he was no white man's friend #</i>

02:40:14.886 --> 02:40:17.616
<i># So goes the Drover's story #</i>

02:40:17.689 --> 02:40:20.249
<i># You will hear it near and far #</i>

02:40:20.324 --> 02:40:25.489
<i># And in the end</i>
<i>it's all he'll ever own #</i>

02:40:25.563 --> 02:40:28.691
<i># It says the outcast is a free man #</i>

02:40:28.766 --> 02:40:31.428
<i># lfhe sleeps under the stars #</i>

02:40:31.502 --> 02:40:36.235
<i># Makes the blanket</i>
<i>of the southern skies his home #</i>

02:41:09.974 --> 02:41:15.810
<i># But the Drover is a man</i>
<i>of constant shadows #</i>

02:41:15.880 --> 02:41:21.011
<i># Haunted by his pain</i>
<i>his past and name #</i>

02:41:21.085 --> 02:41:24.145
<i># For every mile he rides #</i>

02:41:24.222 --> 02:41:26.588
<i># What he cannot hide #</i>

02:41:26.657 --> 02:41:28.921
<i># Is the longing in his heart #</i>

02:41:28.993 --> 02:41:32.053
<i># To love again #</i>

02:41:32.130 --> 02:41:34.826
<i># So goes the Drover's story #</i>

02:41:34.899 --> 02:41:37.390
<i># You'll hear it near and far#</i>

02:41:37.468 --> 02:41:42.303
<i># And in the end</i>
<i>it's all he'll ever own #</i>

02:41:42.373 --> 02:41:45.740
<i># It says the outcast is a free man #</i>

02:41:45.810 --> 02:41:48.438
<i># If he sleeps under the stars #</i>

02:41:48.513 --> 02:41:53.507
<i># Makes the blanket</i>
<i>of the southern skies his home #</i>

02:41:56.754 --> 02:42:01.885
<i># And makes the blanket</i>
