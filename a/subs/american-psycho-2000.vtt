WEBVTT

01:57.994 --> 02:02.123
Our pasta this evening is 
squid ravioli in a lemongrass broth

02:02.207 --> 02:05.794
with goat cheese profiteroles,
and I also have an arugula Caesar salad.

02:05.877 --> 02:09.297
For entrees this evening, I have
swordfish meatloaf with onion marmalade

02:09.380 --> 02:11.716
rare-roasted partridge breast
in raspberry coulis

02:11.800 --> 02:12.842
with a sorrel timbale...

02:12.926 --> 02:16.179
And grilled free-range rabbit
with herbed French fries.

02:16.262 --> 02:19.849
Our pasta tonight is a squid ravioli
in a lemongrass broth,

02:19.933 --> 02:22.227
and the fish tonight is grilled...

02:23.061 --> 02:24.813
With a double espresso.

02:24.896 --> 02:26.981
God, I hate this place.
It's a chicks' restaurant.

02:27.899 --> 02:28.858
Why aren't we at Dorsia?

02:28.942 --> 02:31.945
Because Bateman
won't give the maitre d' head.

02:34.697 --> 02:35.907
Is that Reed Robinson over there?

02:35.990 --> 02:37.867
Are you freebasing or what?
That's not Robinson.

02:37.951 --> 02:40.328
- Well, who is it, then?
- It's Paul Allen.

02:40.411 --> 02:43.540
That's not Paul Allen.
Paul Allen's on the other side of the room.

02:43.623 --> 02:44.999
- Over there.
- Who's he with?

02:45.083 --> 02:46.668
Some weasel from Kicker Peabody.

02:46.751 --> 02:48.670
They don't have
a good bathroom to do coke in.

02:48.753 --> 02:50.004
Are you sure that's Paul Allen over there?

02:50.088 --> 02:51.464
Yes, McDufus, I am.

02:51.548 --> 02:52.924
He's handling the Fisher account.

02:53.007 --> 02:55.510
- Lucky bastard.
- Lucky Jew bastard.

02:55.593 --> 02:57.971
Jesus, McDermott, what does
that have to do with anything?

02:58.054 --> 02:59.931
I've seen that bastard sitting in his office,

03:00.014 --> 03:02.767
talking on the phone to the CEO,
spinning a fucking menorah.

03:02.851 --> 03:05.311
Not a menorah. You spin a dreidel.

03:05.395 --> 03:06.646
Oh, my God, Bateman.

03:06.729 --> 03:10.358
You want me to fry you up some fucking
potato pancakes? Some latkes?

03:10.441 --> 03:14.237
No, just cool it with
the anti-Semitic remarks.

03:14.320 --> 03:18.491
Oh, I'd forgotten.
Bateman's dating someone from the ACLU.

03:18.575 --> 03:21.619
He's the voice of reason.
The boy next door.

03:21.703 --> 03:23.621
Speaking of reasonable.

03:23.705 --> 03:24.998
Only $570.

03:25.957 --> 03:27.667
Not bad.

03:28.251 --> 03:29.502
A little something for the purse.

03:29.586 --> 03:31.004
Give her the $50.

04:11.044 --> 04:12.795
Two Stolis on the rocks.

04:12.879 --> 04:16.048
These aren't good any more. It's a cash bar.

04:17.175 --> 04:18.927
That'll be $25.

04:22.137 --> 04:24.349
You're a fucking ugly bitch.

04:24.432 --> 04:26.643
I want to stab you to death,

04:26.726 --> 04:29.228
then play around with your blood.

04:40.531 --> 04:42.325
What can I get for you two?

05:06.933 --> 05:08.685
<i>I live in the American Gardens building</i>

05:08.768 --> 05:11.521
<i>on West 81st Street, on the 11th floor.</i>

05:12.897 --> 05:16.901
<i>My name is Patrick Bateman.
I'm 27 years old.</i>

05:18.236 --> 05:20.655
<i>I believe in taking care of myself</i>

05:20.738 --> 05:21.990
<i>and a balanced diet</i>

05:22.073 --> 05:25.284
<i>and a rigorous exercise routine.</i>

05:25.368 --> 05:27.745
<i>In the morning, if my face is a little puffy,</i>

05:27.829 --> 05:31.040
<i>I'll put on an ice pack while
doing my stomach crunches.</i>

05:31.124 --> 05:33.501
<i>I can do 1,000 now.</i>

05:50.268 --> 05:54.313
<i>After I remove the ice pack,
I use</i> a <i>deep-pore cleanser lotion</i>

05:54.605 --> 05:57.859
<i>In the shower,
I use a water-activated gel cleanser,</i>

05:59.944 --> 06:02.822
<i>then a honey-almond body scrub,</i>

06:02.905 --> 06:06.868
<i>and on the face, an exfoliating gel scrub.</i>

06:15.793 --> 06:18.087
<i>Then I apply an herb mint facial mask,</i>

06:18.171 --> 06:20.131
<i>which I leave on for 10 minutes,</i>

06:20.214 --> 06:22.967
<i>while I prepare the rest of my routine.</i>

06:24.969 --> 06:27.055
<i>I always use an aftershave lotion</i>

06:27.138 --> 06:28.973
<i>with little or no alcohol,</i>

06:29.057 --> 06:31.059
<i>because alcohol dries your face out</i>

06:31.142 --> 06:32.977
<i>and makes you look older.</i>

06:33.061 --> 06:34.896
<i>Then moisturiser,</i>

06:34.979 --> 06:36.856
<i>then an anti-ageing eye balm</i>

06:36.939 --> 06:40.318
<i>followed by a final
moisturising protective lotion.</i>

06:41.694 --> 06:45.073
<i>There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman,</i>

06:45.156 --> 06:47.116
<i>some kind of abstraction,</i>

06:47.200 --> 06:49.243
<i>but there is no real me,</i>

06:49.327 --> 06:52.538
<i>only an entity, something illusory.</i>

06:52.622 --> 06:54.957
<i>And though I can hide my cold gaze</i>

06:55.041 --> 06:58.086
<i>and you can shake my hand
and feel flesh gripping yours,</i>

06:58.169 --> 06:59.754
<i>and maybe you can even sense</i>

06:59.837 --> 07:02.590
<i>our lifestyles are probably comparable,</i>

07:03.257 --> 07:06.385
<i>I simply am not there.</i>

07:33.287 --> 07:35.873
Morning, Hamilton. Nice tan.

07:40.211 --> 07:43.297
- Late.
- Aerobics class, sorry. Any messages?

07:43.381 --> 07:44.799
Ricky Harrison has to cancel.

07:44.882 --> 07:46.968
He didn't say what
he was cancelling or why.

07:47.051 --> 07:50.721
I occasionally box with Ricky
at the Harvard Club. Anyone else?

07:50.805 --> 07:53.099
Spencer wants to meet for drinks
at Flutie's Pier 17.

07:53.182 --> 07:54.684
- When?
- After 6.00.

07:54.767 --> 07:57.311
- Negative. Cancel it.
- And what should I say?

07:57.395 --> 08:00.815
- Just say no.
- Just say no?

08:00.898 --> 08:06.154
Okay, Jean, I need reservations
for three at Camels at 12:30,

08:06.237 --> 08:07.905
and if not there, try Crayons, all right?

08:07.989 --> 08:09.949
Yes, sir.

08:10.032 --> 08:12.827
Oh, wait, and I need reservations for two

08:12.910 --> 08:15.997
at Arcadia at 8:00 on Thursday.

08:16.539 --> 08:18.166
Something romantic?

08:18.249 --> 08:19.584
No.

08:21.169 --> 08:22.587
Silly.

08:22.962 --> 08:24.130
Forget it, I'll make them.

08:24.213 --> 08:25.882
- No, I'll do it.
- No, no.

08:25.965 --> 08:29.260
Be a doll and just get me
a mineral water, okay?

08:29.760 --> 08:31.220
You look nice today.

08:31.304 --> 08:32.847
Don't wear that outfit again.

08:32.929 --> 08:34.347
What? I didn't hear you.

08:34.432 --> 08:36.767
I said, do not wear that outfit again.

08:36.851 --> 08:39.102
Wear a dress, a skirt or something.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.147
You don't like this, I take it?

08:41.230 --> 08:43.774
Come on, you're prettier than that.

08:44.609 --> 08:45.902
Thanks, Patrick.

08:46.485 --> 08:48.029
I'm not here.

08:48.112 --> 08:51.157
And high heels. I like high heels.

08:59.832 --> 09:01.417
<i>"Feathered Friends" for 600.</i>

09:01.500 --> 09:03.794
<i>During courtship, the male frigate bird</i>

09:03.920 --> 09:06.589
<i>inflates to enormous size
the red pouch found here.</i>

09:22.063 --> 09:23.773
Thousands of roses,

09:23.856 --> 09:27.235
and lots of chocolate truffles, Godiva,

09:27.318 --> 09:28.611
and oysters on the half shell.

09:28.694 --> 09:31.239
<i>I'm trying to listen to the
new Robert Palmer tape,</i>

09:31.322 --> 09:33.407
<i>but Evelyn, my supposed fianc√©e,</i>

09:33.491 --> 09:36.160
<i>keeps buzzing in my ear.</i>

09:36.244 --> 09:39.247
Annie Leibovitz. We'll get Annie Leibovitz.

09:39.330 --> 09:42.250
And we'll have to get
someone to videotape.

09:42.541 --> 09:45.378
Patrick, we should do it.

09:45.878 --> 09:48.923
- Do what?
- Get married. Have a wedding.

09:49.006 --> 09:50.424
No, I can't take the time off work.

09:50.508 --> 09:53.427
Your father practically owns the company.
You can do anything you like, silly.

09:53.511 --> 09:54.679
I don't want to talk about it.

09:54.762 --> 09:58.140
You hate that job anyway.
I don't see why you just don't quit.

09:58.683 --> 10:02.645
Because I want to fit in.

10:13.906 --> 10:15.700
Williams party.

10:15.866 --> 10:18.995
<i>I'm on the verge of tears
by the time we arrive at Espace,</i>

10:19.078 --> 10:21.706
<i>since I'm positive
we won't have a decent table.</i>

10:22.331 --> 10:23.582
<i>But we do,</i>

10:23.666 --> 10:26.502
<i>and relief washes over me
in an awesome wave.</i>

10:26.585 --> 10:30.715
Patrick, this is my cousin
Vanden and her boyfriend Stash.

10:31.215 --> 10:32.383
They're both artists.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.260
- The menu's in Braille.
- I see you've met everyone.

10:34.343 --> 10:36.262
You look awesome.

10:37.096 --> 10:40.391
Okay, okay, all right.

10:41.225 --> 10:45.688
<i>I'm fairly certain that Timothy Bryce
and Evelyn are having an affair.</i>

10:45.896 --> 10:48.649
<i>Timothy is the only
interesting person I know.</i>

10:48.733 --> 10:50.443
<i>I'm almost completely indifferent</i>

10:50.526 --> 10:53.696
<i>as to whether Evelyn knows
I'm having an affair</i>

10:53.779 --> 10:57.575
<i>with Courtney Rawlinson,
her closest friend.</i>

10:57.658 --> 11:00.369
<i>Courtney is almost perfect-looking.</i>

11:00.453 --> 11:02.997
<i>She's usually operating on
one or more psychiatric drugs.</i>

11:03.080 --> 11:05.374
<i>Tonight, I believe it's Xanax.</i>

11:05.458 --> 11:07.335
<i>More disturbing than her drug use, though,</i>

11:07.418 --> 11:08.919
<i>is the fact that she's engaged</i>

11:09.003 --> 11:12.465
<i>to Luis Carruthers,
the biggest dufus in the business.</i>

11:12.548 --> 11:14.884
Tell me, Stash,

11:14.967 --> 11:18.387
do you think Soho
is becoming too commercial?

11:18.471 --> 11:20.014
Yes, I read that.

11:20.097 --> 11:21.474
Oh, who gives a rat's ass?

11:21.557 --> 11:24.101
Hey, that affects us.

11:24.185 --> 11:26.854
What about the massacres
in Sri Lanka, honey?

11:26.937 --> 11:29.482
Doesn't that affect us, too?
Do you know anything about Sri Lanka?

11:29.565 --> 11:32.443
How, like, the Sikhs are, like,
killing tons of Israelis over there?

11:32.526 --> 11:34.111
Come on, Bryce.

11:34.195 --> 11:37.448
There are a lot more important
problems than Sri Lanka to worry about.

11:37.531 --> 11:38.532
Like what?

11:38.616 --> 11:41.160
Well, we have to end apartheid, for one,

11:41.285 --> 11:43.746
and slow down the nuclear arms race,

11:43.829 --> 11:46.665
stop terrorism, and world hunger.

11:46.749 --> 11:50.669
We have to provide food and shelter
for the homeless

11:50.753 --> 11:54.632
and oppose racial discrimination
and promote civil rights

11:54.715 --> 11:57.635
while also promoting
equal rights for women.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.970
We have to encourage a return

12:00.596 --> 12:03.599
to traditional moral values.

12:04.100 --> 12:05.559
Most importantly,

12:05.643 --> 12:09.688
we have to promote general social concern

12:09.772 --> 12:11.982
and less materialism in young people.

12:14.151 --> 12:15.152
Patrick,

12:16.487 --> 12:18.322
how thought-provoking.

12:54.567 --> 12:56.068
Hello.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.530
Hello.

13:17.882 --> 13:20.468
"Bleach-ee"?
Are you trying to say "bleach-ee"?

13:20.551 --> 13:21.760
Oh, my God. Two things.

13:21.844 --> 13:24.805
One, you can't bleach a Cerruti.
Out of the question.

13:24.889 --> 13:27.266
Two, I can only get
these sheets in Santa Fe.

13:27.349 --> 13:30.144
These are very expensive sheets
and I really need them clean.

13:30.227 --> 13:32.271
If you don't shut your fucking mouth,

13:32.354 --> 13:33.564
I will kill you

13:34.607 --> 13:36.984
I have a lunch meeting at Hubert's
in 20 minutes with Ronald Harrison

13:37.067 --> 13:39.528
and I need those sheets
cleaned by this afternoon.

13:39.612 --> 13:42.948
I cannot understand you!
This is crazy. You're a fool.

13:43.032 --> 13:45.034
I can't cope with this. Stupid "bitch-ee"!

13:45.117 --> 13:46.827
Understand? Christ.

13:47.244 --> 13:48.454
Patrick?

13:48.746 --> 13:51.457
Hi, Patrick. I thought that was you

13:51.540 --> 13:53.000
Hello...

13:53.083 --> 13:55.044
Isn't it ridiculous coming
all the way up here?

13:55.127 --> 13:56.545
But they really are the best.

13:56.629 --> 13:58.631
Then why can't they get these stains out?

13:58.714 --> 14:02.134
Can you talk to these people or something?
I'm not getting anywhere.

14:02.218 --> 14:03.969
Oh, what are those?

14:04.595 --> 14:07.097
Oh, well, it's cranberry juice. Cran-apple.

14:07.181 --> 14:08.224
Really?

14:08.307 --> 14:11.185
Listen, if you could talk to them,
I would really appreciate it.

14:11.268 --> 14:14.188
I'm really late. I have a lunch appointment
at Hubert's in 15 minutes.

14:14.271 --> 14:16.065
Hubert's? That moved uptown, right?

14:16.148 --> 14:19.026
Well, boy, listen, I've gotta go.
Thank you, Victoria.

14:19.109 --> 14:20.903
Maybe we could do lunch
one day next week.

14:20.986 --> 14:22.071
You know, I'm downtown...

14:22.154 --> 14:25.533
- I don't know. I'm at work all the time.
- What about a Saturday?

14:26.116 --> 14:27.701
- Next Saturday?
- Sure.

14:27.785 --> 14:29.578
Can't, I'm afraid.
I have a matin√©e of <i>Les Mis.</i>

14:29.662 --> 14:32.122
I've really got to go. Christ. I'll call you.

14:32.206 --> 14:34.458
Okay. Do.

14:34.750 --> 14:36.877
Listen, you're dating Luis. He's in Arizona.

14:36.961 --> 14:38.879
You're fucking me,
and we haven't made plans.

14:38.963 --> 14:40.881
What could you possibly be up to tonight?

14:40.965 --> 14:43.384
<i>- Stop it. I'm...
- On a lot of lithium?</i>

14:43.634 --> 14:45.511
Waiting for Luis to call me.

14:45.594 --> 14:47.054
He said he'd call tonight.

14:47.429 --> 14:48.597
Pumpkin.

14:49.348 --> 14:50.849
Pumpkin, you're dating an asshole.

14:51.308 --> 14:54.353
<i>Pumpkin, you're dating
the biggest dickweed in New York.</i>

14:55.145 --> 14:58.899
Pumpkin, you're dating
a tumbling, tumbling dickweed.

14:58.983 --> 15:01.735
<i>Patrick, stop calling me pumpkin, okay?</i>

15:03.112 --> 15:05.322
- I have to go.
- Courtney!

15:05.864 --> 15:07.866
- Dinner.
- I can't!

15:07.950 --> 15:09.660
<i>I'm thinking Dorsia.</i>

15:12.204 --> 15:13.414
Dorsia's nice.

15:13.497 --> 15:15.124
<i>Wear something fabulous.</i>

15:29.388 --> 15:30.514
<i>Dorsia.</i>

15:30.598 --> 15:31.974
Yes, I know it's a little late,

15:32.057 --> 15:34.602
but is it possible to reserve a table for two

15:34.685 --> 15:37.938
at 8:00 or 8:30, perhaps?

15:53.787 --> 15:57.875
A facial at Elizabeth Arden,
which was really relaxing,

15:58.709 --> 16:01.420
and then to the Pottery Barn

16:01.503 --> 16:06.258
where I got this little silver muffin dish.

16:06.342 --> 16:07.635
Is that Donald Trump's car?

16:07.718 --> 16:09.595
God, Patrick, shut up.

16:09.678 --> 16:12.348
Courtney, you should take
some more lithium or have a Diet Coke.

16:12.431 --> 16:14.600
Some caffeine
might get you out of this slump.

16:15.559 --> 16:18.312
I just want a child

16:18.604 --> 16:20.773
Just two

16:20.856 --> 16:22.358
perfect

16:23.400 --> 16:25.736
children.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.450
Are we here?

16:31.533 --> 16:32.910
Yeah.

16:40.292 --> 16:41.585
This is Dorsia?

16:41.669 --> 16:43.462
- Good evening.
- Yes, dear.

16:43.962 --> 16:46.465
Courtney, you're gonna have
the peanut butter soup

16:46.548 --> 16:49.051
with smoked duck and mashed squash.

16:49.134 --> 16:50.844
<i>New York Matinee called it</i>

16:50.928 --> 16:52.930
"a playful, but mysterious little dish."

16:53.013 --> 16:54.431
You'll love it.

16:54.515 --> 16:57.518
And then the red snapper
with violets and pine nuts.

16:57.601 --> 16:59.478
I think that will follow nicely.

17:01.772 --> 17:03.232
Thanks, Patrick.

17:09.738 --> 17:12.366
Patrick, thanks so much
for looking after Courtney.

17:12.449 --> 17:14.910
Dorsia, how impressive.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.079
How on earth did you
get a reservation there?

17:17.162 --> 17:19.039
Lucky, I guess.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.791
That's a wonderful suit.

17:21.875 --> 17:24.545
Don't tell me, don't tell me, let me guess.

17:25.378 --> 17:26.922
Valentino Couture.

17:29.299 --> 17:30.718
It looks so soft.

17:30.801 --> 17:33.262
Your compliment was sufficient, Luis.

17:34.304 --> 17:37.558
Hello, Halberstram. Nice tie.

17:38.016 --> 17:39.059
How the hell are you?

17:39.143 --> 17:42.604
<i>Allen has mistaken me for this dickhead,
Marcus Halberstram.</i>

17:42.688 --> 17:45.357
<i>It seems logical, because
Marcus also works at P&P</i>

17:45.441 --> 17:47.735
<i>and, in fact, does the same exact thing I do.</i>

17:47.818 --> 17:51.905
<i>He also has a penchant for Valentino suits
and Oliver Peoples glasses.</i>

17:51.989 --> 17:53.782
<i>Marcus and I even go to the same barber,</i>

17:53.866 --> 17:55.951
<i>although I have a slightly better haircut.</i>

17:56.034 --> 17:57.870
So how's the Ransom account
going, Marcus?

17:57.953 --> 17:59.747
- It's all right.
- Really?

17:59.830 --> 18:02.249
That's interesting. It's not... It's not great.

18:02.332 --> 18:06.003
- Oh, well, you know.
- So how's Cecilia? She's a great girl.

18:06.086 --> 18:08.130
Oh, yeah, I'm very lucky.

18:08.505 --> 18:11.049
Hey, Allen.
Congratulations on the Fisher account.

18:11.133 --> 18:12.384
Thank you, Baxter.

18:12.468 --> 18:14.511
Listen, Paul. Squash?

18:18.307 --> 18:19.892
Call me.

18:21.143 --> 18:22.853
- How about Friday?
- No can do.

18:23.645 --> 18:26.106
I got an 8:30 res at Dorsia.

18:26.190 --> 18:29.443
Great sea urchin ceviche.

18:29.818 --> 18:32.112
Dorsia on a Friday night?
How'd he swing that?

18:32.488 --> 18:33.906
I think he's lying.

18:36.867 --> 18:38.076
Is that a gram?

18:39.036 --> 18:40.412
New card.

18:40.496 --> 18:41.538
What do you think?

18:43.040 --> 18:45.292
Whoa. Very nice.

18:46.001 --> 18:47.211
Look at that.

18:47.294 --> 18:49.213
Picked them up from
the printer's yesterday.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.465
- Good colouring.
- That's bone.

18:51.548 --> 18:54.301
And the lettering is
something called Silian Rail.

18:54.384 --> 18:55.385
It's very cool, Bateman.

18:55.469 --> 18:57.262
But that's nothing. Look at this.

18:58.263 --> 19:00.057
That is really nice.

19:00.140 --> 19:02.684
Eggshell with Romalian type.

19:03.393 --> 19:04.728
What do you think?

19:05.604 --> 19:06.980
Nice.

19:07.064 --> 19:09.399
Jesus. That is really super.

19:09.483 --> 19:11.735
How did a nitwit like you get so tasteful?

19:12.152 --> 19:13.487
<i>I can't believe</i>

19:13.570 --> 19:16.698
<i>that Bryce prefers Van Patten 's card
to mine.</i>

19:16.782 --> 19:19.952
But wait. You ain't seen nothin' yet.

19:21.787 --> 19:26.166
Raised lettering. Pale Nimbus White.

19:27.835 --> 19:30.379
Impressive. Very nice.

19:32.798 --> 19:34.550
Let's see Paul Allen's card.

19:48.814 --> 19:50.941
<i>Look at that subtle off-white colouring,</i>

19:51.483 --> 19:53.485
<i>the tasteful thickness of it.</i>

19:53.569 --> 19:55.279
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

19:55.362 --> 19:57.489
<i>It even has a watermark.</i>

20:01.785 --> 20:04.246
ls something wrong, Patrick?

20:04.621 --> 20:06.331
You're sweating.

20:34.568 --> 20:36.403
Hello.

20:36.486 --> 20:39.823
Pat Bateman. You want some money?

20:40.574 --> 20:42.618
Some food?

20:44.244 --> 20:46.413
- This what you need?
- I'm hungry.

20:46.496 --> 20:48.373
Yeah. Cold out, too, isn't it?

20:53.211 --> 20:54.588
Why don't you get a job?

20:54.671 --> 20:56.590
If you're so hungry,
why don't you get a job?

20:56.673 --> 20:58.759
I lost my job.

20:58.842 --> 21:01.011
Why? You drinking?

21:01.678 --> 21:03.513
Is that why you lost it?

21:03.597 --> 21:06.934
Insider trading? Just joking.

21:07.017 --> 21:09.895
- Listen, what's your name?
- Al.

21:10.354 --> 21:11.730
Speak up. Come on.

21:11.813 --> 21:14.608
- Al.
- Get a goddamn job, Al.

21:14.691 --> 21:17.611
You got a negative attitude.
That's what's stopping you.

21:17.694 --> 21:19.696
You gotta get your act together.

21:19.780 --> 21:21.490
I'll help you.

21:21.573 --> 21:23.408
You are so kind, mister.

21:23.492 --> 21:25.410
You're kind. You're a kind man.

21:25.494 --> 21:26.620
- It's okay.
- I can tell.

21:26.703 --> 21:29.289
Please, you gotta tell me what to do.

21:29.498 --> 21:31.625
You gotta help me. I'm so cold.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.210
I'm hungry.

21:35.170 --> 21:36.630
You know how bad you smell?

21:36.713 --> 21:39.216
You reek of shit. Do you know that?

21:40.425 --> 21:41.551
AI.

21:42.719 --> 21:44.429
I'm sorry.

21:44.513 --> 21:47.724
It's just that... I don't know.

21:49.351 --> 21:52.187
I don't have anything in common with you.

22:00.529 --> 22:03.782
Oh, thank you, mister. Thank you.

22:04.241 --> 22:05.742
I'm cold out here.

22:05.826 --> 22:08.745
- You know what a fucking loser you are?
- What?

22:32.978 --> 22:35.897
What beautiful skin you have, Mr Bateman.

22:36.273 --> 22:38.900
So fine, so smooth.

22:46.700 --> 22:49.244
<i>I have all the characteristics
of a human being,</i>

22:49.745 --> 22:53.040
<i>flesh, blood, skin, hair,</i>

22:53.123 --> 22:56.334
<i>but not a single clear identifiable emotion,</i>

22:56.418 --> 22:59.838
<i>except for greed and disgust.</i>

23:00.422 --> 23:03.091
<i>Something horrible
is happening inside of me,</i>

23:03.175 --> 23:05.844
<i>and I don't know why.</i>

23:05.927 --> 23:09.723
<i>My nightly blood lust
has overflowed into my days.</i>

23:09.806 --> 23:13.310
<i>I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy.</i>

23:13.393 --> 23:16.813
<i>I think my mask of sanity is about to slip.</i>

23:28.992 --> 23:31.995
Hey, Mac:Loy, what do you say?

23:32.162 --> 23:34.247
Hey, Hamilton,
have a holly, jolly Christmas.

23:34.331 --> 23:37.000
Is Allen still handling the Fisher account?

23:37.167 --> 23:38.710
Of course. Who else?

23:38.794 --> 23:41.838
Mistletoe alert. Merry Xmas, Patrick.

23:42.130 --> 23:44.591
- Merry Xmas, Harry.
- Merry Christmas.

23:44.674 --> 23:46.259
- You're late, honey.
- I'm not late.

23:46.343 --> 23:48.762
- Oh, yes, you are.
- I've been here the entire time.

23:48.845 --> 23:50.222
You just didn't see me.

23:50.305 --> 23:51.473
Say hello to Snowball.

23:51.556 --> 23:54.017
Snowball says "Merry Christmas, Patrick."

23:54.643 --> 23:55.644
What is it?

23:55.727 --> 23:58.271
It's a little baby piggy-wiggy, isn't it?

23:58.355 --> 24:00.107
It's a Vietnamese potbellied pig.

24:00.190 --> 24:02.984
They make darling pets. Don't you?

24:03.068 --> 24:04.778
Don't you?

24:05.612 --> 24:07.989
Stop scowling, Patrick.
You're such a Grinch.

24:08.073 --> 24:10.283
What does Mr Grinch want for Christmas?

24:10.367 --> 24:12.786
And don't say "breast implants" again.

24:15.372 --> 24:18.250
- Allen.
- Marcus! Merry Christmas.

24:18.333 --> 24:20.585
How you been? Workaholic, I suppose?

24:20.669 --> 24:22.587
I haven't seen you in a while.

24:22.671 --> 24:26.591
Hey, Hamilton! We're going to Nell's.
Limo's out front.

24:26.675 --> 24:27.801
We should have dinner.

24:27.884 --> 24:29.803
Maybe you could bring...

24:29.886 --> 24:32.305
- Cecilia?
- Yes, Cecilia!

24:32.389 --> 24:34.641
Oh, Cecilia would adore it.

24:34.724 --> 24:36.726
Well, then let's do it, Marcus.

24:37.144 --> 24:39.187
- Great party.
- Thanks.

24:39.271 --> 24:42.149
Patrick, why is he calling you Marcus?

24:42.440 --> 24:44.317
Mistletoe alert.

24:52.450 --> 24:55.412
Marcus Halberstram for two at 7.00.

24:57.080 --> 24:58.456
No, I want to know.

24:58.540 --> 25:01.334
I came here for
the cilantro crawfish gumbo. All right?

25:01.418 --> 25:04.462
Which is, after all, the only excuse
one could have for being in this restaurant,

25:04.546 --> 25:07.007
which is, by the way,
almost completely empty.

25:07.090 --> 25:10.343
- I'm very sorry, sir.
- J&B straight and a Corona.

25:10.427 --> 25:13.305
- Would you like to hear...
- Double Absolut martini.

25:13.388 --> 25:15.807
Yes, sir.
Would you like to hear the specials?

25:15.891 --> 25:18.685
Not if you want to keep your spleen.

25:21.438 --> 25:24.107
This is a real beehive
of activity, Halberstram.

25:24.191 --> 25:26.318
This place is hot. Very hot.

25:26.401 --> 25:30.405
Listen, the mud soup and charcoal arugula
are outrageous here.

25:30.488 --> 25:31.948
Yeah, well, you're late.

25:32.032 --> 25:35.577
Hey, I'm a child of divorce. Give me a break.

25:36.119 --> 25:38.830
I see they've omitted
the pork loin with lime Jell-0.

25:38.914 --> 25:40.749
We should've gone to Dorsia.

25:40.832 --> 25:42.417
I could have gotten us a table.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.711
Nobody goes there any more.

25:46.213 --> 25:48.632
Is that lvana Trump?

25:49.382 --> 25:51.551
Oh, jeez, Patrick... I mean, Marcus,

25:51.635 --> 25:53.094
what are you thinking?

25:53.178 --> 25:55.931
Why would lvana be at Texarkana?

25:56.765 --> 26:00.602
So, wasn't Rothschild
originally handling the Fisher account?

26:01.144 --> 26:02.395
How'd you get it?

26:02.479 --> 26:04.940
Well, I could tell you that, Halberstram,

26:05.523 --> 26:07.734
but then I'd have to kill you.

26:15.116 --> 26:16.826
I like to dissect girls.

26:16.910 --> 26:18.745
Did you know I'm utterly insane?

26:21.331 --> 26:23.792
Great tan, Marcus. Really impressive.

26:23.875 --> 26:25.669
- Where do you tan?
- Salon.

26:25.752 --> 26:28.713
I've got a tanning bed at home.
You should look into it.

26:29.130 --> 26:32.592
And Cecilia... How is she?

26:32.676 --> 26:33.885
Where is she tonight?

26:33.969 --> 26:36.346
Cecilia is... Well, you know Cecilia.

26:36.429 --> 26:39.933
I think she's having dinner
with Evelyn Williams.

26:40.016 --> 26:42.769
Evelyn! Great ass.

26:42.852 --> 26:44.646
Goes out with that loser Patrick Bateman.

26:44.729 --> 26:47.607
What a dork.

26:47.691 --> 26:49.317
Another martini, Paul?

26:55.365 --> 26:56.866
You like Huey Lewis and the News?

26:58.410 --> 27:00.370
They're okay.

27:01.246 --> 27:05.375
Their early work was
a little too new wave for my taste.

27:05.458 --> 27:08.128
But when Sports came out in '83,

27:08.211 --> 27:11.589
I think they really came into their own,
commercially and artistically.

27:14.592 --> 27:17.095
The whole album has a clear, crisp sound

27:17.178 --> 27:19.848
and a new sheen of
consummate professionalism

27:19.931 --> 27:22.976
that really gives the songs a big boost.

27:32.694 --> 27:34.821
He's been compared to Elvis Costello,

27:34.904 --> 27:39.451
but I think Huey has a far more bitter,
cynical sense of humour.

27:39.534 --> 27:41.786
- Hey, Halberstram.
- Yes, Allen?

27:41.870 --> 27:45.332
Why are there copies of the Style section
all over the place?

27:45.415 --> 27:46.916
Do you have a dog?

27:47.000 --> 27:49.753
A little chow or something?

27:49.836 --> 27:52.339
- No, Allen.
- Is that a raincoat?

27:52.422 --> 27:54.591
Yes, it is!

27:55.133 --> 27:57.510
In '87, Huey released this,

27:57.802 --> 27:59.637
Forel, their most accomplished album.

27:59.721 --> 28:03.058
I think their undisputed masterpiece
is Hip to be Square.

28:03.141 --> 28:06.519
The song's so catchy. Most people
probably don't listen to the lyrics.

28:06.603 --> 28:08.563
But they should because it's not just about

28:08.646 --> 28:11.399
the pleasures of conformity
and the importance of trends,

28:11.483 --> 28:14.986
it's also a personal statement
about the band itself.

28:15.070 --> 28:16.279
Hey, Paul?

28:21.910 --> 28:24.371
Try getting a reservation at Dorsia now,

28:24.454 --> 28:26.915
you fucking stupid bastard!

28:29.793 --> 28:33.046
You fucking bastard!

28:34.631 --> 28:36.633
<i>'Cause I can tell
what's going on</i>

28:36.716 --> 28:38.802
<i>It's hip to be square</i>

28:40.512 --> 28:41.930
<i>It's hip to be square</i>

28:44.641 --> 28:48.395
<i>I like my bands in business suits</i>

28:48.478 --> 28:51.773
<i>I watch them on TV</i>

28:51.856 --> 28:54.567
<i>I'm working out 'most every day</i>

28:54.651 --> 28:56.903
<i>And watching what I eat</i>

28:58.696 --> 29:01.574
<i>They tell me that it's good for me</i>

29:01.658 --> 29:05.036
<i>But I don't even care</i>

29:05.120 --> 29:06.871
<i>I know that it's crazy</i>

29:06.955 --> 29:08.581
<i>I know that it's nowhere</i>

29:08.665 --> 29:10.959
<i>There is no denying that</i>

29:11.042 --> 29:13.169
<i>It's hip to be square</i>

29:14.379 --> 29:16.172
<i>It's hip to be square</i>

29:31.104 --> 29:33.273
He was completely naked
and he was standing

29:33.356 --> 29:36.025
on one of the tables
with everyone watching...

29:37.694 --> 29:39.654
Patrick? Patrick!

29:40.697 --> 29:41.739
Is that you?

29:41.823 --> 29:44.951
No, Luis, it's not me. You're mistaken.

29:45.034 --> 29:47.787
This is my very good friend,
Patrick Bateman.

29:47.871 --> 29:50.248
Where are you going?
We're going to Nell's.

29:50.331 --> 29:52.667
Gwendolyn's father is buying it.

29:55.962 --> 29:58.590
Where did you get that overnight bag?

30:00.258 --> 30:02.051
Jean Paul Gaultier.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.440
<i>When I get to Paul Allen's place,</i>

30:15.523 --> 30:19.486
<i>I use the keys I took from his pocket
before disposing of the body.</i>

30:19.819 --> 30:22.780
<i>There is a moment of sheer panic</i>

30:22.864 --> 30:26.784
<i>when I realise that Paul's apartment
overlooks the park</i>

30:27.285 --> 30:30.288
<i>and it's obviously
more expensive than mine.</i>

30:33.166 --> 30:36.336
<i>I calm myself and move into the bedroom,</i>

30:36.419 --> 30:38.963
<i>where I find his suitcase and start to pack.</i>

30:39.881 --> 30:42.759
<i>It's time for Paul to take a little trip.</i>

30:45.261 --> 30:47.180
Where to send the bastard?

30:47.263 --> 30:48.973
Dallas?

30:49.057 --> 30:51.851
Paris? Singapore?

30:51.935 --> 30:54.229
London. I'll send the ass to London.

31:02.570 --> 31:03.738
Hi, this is Paul.

31:03.821 --> 31:05.615
I've been called away
to London for a few days.

31:05.698 --> 31:07.742
Meredith, I'll call you when I get back.

31:07.825 --> 31:09.494
Hasta la vista, baby.

31:34.435 --> 31:35.937
What is it?

31:36.646 --> 31:37.647
Patrick.

31:38.856 --> 31:40.358
Yes, Jean?

31:40.441 --> 31:42.527
There's a Mr Donald Kimball
here to see you.

31:42.610 --> 31:43.945
Who?

31:44.028 --> 31:46.155
Detective Donald Kimball.

31:50.577 --> 31:52.328
Tell him I'm at lunch.

31:52.704 --> 31:55.999
Patrick, it's only 10:30.
I think he knows you're here.

31:56.833 --> 31:58.835
Send him in, I guess.

32:05.300 --> 32:08.928
Now, John, you've gotta wear clothes
in proportion to your physique.

32:09.262 --> 32:12.849
There are definite do's and don'ts, good
buddy, of wearing a bold-striped shirt.

32:13.099 --> 32:15.852
A bold-striped shirt calls for solid-coloured

32:15.935 --> 32:18.313
or discretely patterned suits and ties.

32:18.396 --> 32:21.858
Yes, always tip the stylist 15%.

32:22.191 --> 32:25.194
Listen, John, I've got to go.
T. Boone Pickens just walked in

32:25.778 --> 32:26.946
Just joking.

32:27.447 --> 32:29.866
No, don't tip the owner of the salon.

32:30.158 --> 32:33.036
Okay, John. Right. Got it.

32:34.537 --> 32:35.788
Sorry about that.

32:35.872 --> 32:38.166
No, I'm sorry.
I should've made an appointment.

32:38.249 --> 32:40.293
Was that anything important?

32:40.376 --> 32:43.129
Oh, that?
Just mulling over business problems,

32:43.212 --> 32:46.174
examining opportunities,
exchanging rumours,

32:46.716 --> 32:48.051
spreading gossip-

32:49.385 --> 32:52.096
Hi. I'm Donald Kimball.

32:52.597 --> 32:54.807
Hi, Pat Bateman. Nice to meet you.

32:54.891 --> 32:58.436
Sorry to barge in on you like this.
I know how busy you guys can get.

33:00.813 --> 33:05.568
So, what's the topic of discussion?

33:05.652 --> 33:07.654
I've been hired by Meredith Powell

33:08.446 --> 33:11.282
to investigate the disappearance
of Paul Allen.

33:12.742 --> 33:15.411
I see, yeah. Paul's disappearance, yeah.

33:15.495 --> 33:19.374
So it's nothing that official. I just have
some basic questions about Paul Allen.

33:19.457 --> 33:21.000
- About yourself...
- Coffee?

33:21.084 --> 33:22.168
No, I'm okay.

33:22.251 --> 33:24.087
- Apollinaris?
- No, I'm okay.

33:26.089 --> 33:28.174
- Can you bring Mister...
- Kimball.

33:28.257 --> 33:29.509
Mr Kimball a bottle...

33:29.592 --> 33:32.011
- No, really, I'm okay.
- It's no problem.

33:34.806 --> 33:36.683
So, what's the topic of discussion?

33:36.766 --> 33:40.019
The disappearance of Paul Allen.

33:40.103 --> 33:41.270
Right.

33:41.354 --> 33:44.357
Well, I haven't...

33:44.941 --> 33:48.861
I haven't heard anything about
the disappearance or anything,

33:48.945 --> 33:51.114
not on <i>Page</i> Six at least.

33:51.197 --> 33:54.742
- I think his family wants this kept quiet.
- Understandable. Lime?

33:55.118 --> 33:57.912
- No, really, I'm okay.
- You sure? I can always get you a lime.

33:57.995 --> 34:01.708
Just some preliminary questions that I need
for my own files, okay?

34:01.791 --> 34:03.126
Shoot

34:03.543 --> 34:06.212
- How old are you?
-27.

34:06.587 --> 34:08.715
- Where did you go to school?
- Harvard.

34:08.797 --> 34:11.259
- Then Harvard Business School.
- Your address?

34:11.342 --> 34:13.344
The American Gardens building,
West 81 st Street.

34:14.011 --> 34:16.556
- Nice. Very nice.
- Thanks.

34:17.181 --> 34:20.309
- What can you tell me about Paul Allen?
- I'm at a loss.

34:20.810 --> 34:22.562
He was part of that whole Yale thing.

34:22.645 --> 34:25.148
-"Yale thing"?
- Yeah, Yale thing.

34:25.231 --> 34:26.607
What do you mean, "Yale thing"?

34:26.690 --> 34:30.445
Well, I think for one that he was
probably a closet homosexual

34:30.527 --> 34:32.780
who did a lot of cocaine.

34:32.864 --> 34:34.364
That Yale thing.

34:35.199 --> 34:36.868
What kind of man was he?

34:36.951 --> 34:39.078
Besides the information
you've just given me.

34:39.161 --> 34:40.996
I hope I'm not being cross-examined here.

34:41.080 --> 34:44.250
- Do you feel like that?
- No, not really.

34:45.960 --> 34:48.588
- Where did Paul hang out?
- Hang out?

34:48.670 --> 34:50.089
Yeah, you know, hang out.

34:50.214 --> 34:53.050
Let me think. The Newport.

34:53.134 --> 34:55.469
Harry's. Flutie's.

34:55.553 --> 34:58.264
Indochine. Nell's. The Cornell Club.

34:58.347 --> 35:00.641
- The New York Yacht Club.
- He had a yacht?

35:00.725 --> 35:02.185
No, he just hung out there.

35:02.268 --> 35:04.312
And where did he go to school?

35:06.230 --> 35:09.484
- Don't you know this?
- I just wanted to know if you know.

35:13.362 --> 35:16.324
Before Yale, if I remember correctly,
Saint Paul's.

35:16.407 --> 35:19.994
Listen, I just... I just want to help.

35:21.621 --> 35:23.206
I understand.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.126
Do you have any witnesses or fingerprints?

35:27.210 --> 35:30.087
Well, there's a message
on his answering machine

35:30.171 --> 35:31.547
that says he went to London.

35:31.631 --> 35:33.883
- Maybe he did, huh?
- His girlfriend doesn't think so.

35:33.966 --> 35:37.136
- But has anyone seen him in London?
- Actually, yes.

35:37.220 --> 35:39.514
But I've had a hard time
getting actual verification.

35:39.597 --> 35:43.142
A Stephen Hughes said he saw him
at a restaurant there.

35:43.226 --> 35:44.811
But I checked it out, and what happened is

35:44.894 --> 35:47.647
he mistook a Herbert Ainsworth
for Paul, so...

35:47.730 --> 35:49.357
Had his apartment been burglarized?

35:49.440 --> 35:51.484
No, actually it hadn't.

35:51.567 --> 35:54.737
Toiletries were missing, a suit was gone,
so was some luggage, that's it.

35:54.821 --> 35:57.240
I mean, no one's dealing with
the homicide squad yet, or anything, right?

35:57.323 --> 35:59.617
No, not yet. As I said, we're not sure.

35:59.700 --> 36:02.328
Basically, no one's seen or heard anything.

36:02.411 --> 36:05.248
- So typical, isn't it?
- It's just strange.

36:05.498 --> 36:07.500
One day someone's walking around,

36:07.583 --> 36:10.294
going to work, alive, and then...

36:10.378 --> 36:11.796
Nothing.

36:12.797 --> 36:14.465
People just disappear.

36:15.258 --> 36:18.928
The earth just opens up
and swallows them.

36:19.762 --> 36:22.932
Eerie. Really eerie.

36:28.479 --> 36:30.773
Listen, you'll have to excuse me.

36:30.857 --> 36:32.859
I have a lunch meeting with Cliff Huxtable

36:32.942 --> 36:35.069
at The Four Seasons in 20 minutes.

36:35.653 --> 36:38.489
The Four Seasons?
Isn't that a little far uptown?

36:38.573 --> 36:40.908
I mean, aren't you gonna be late?

36:40.992 --> 36:42.702
No, there's one down here.

36:42.785 --> 36:44.954
- Oh, really? I didn't know that.
- It's very good.

36:45.079 --> 36:49.083
Listen, if anything else occurs to you,
any information...

36:49.166 --> 36:51.085
Absolutely. I'm 100% with you.

36:51.168 --> 36:56.132
Great, and thanks for your time,
Mr Bateman.

36:59.594 --> 37:01.804
- Bye-bye.
- Good bye.

38:00.988 --> 38:02.990
I haven't seen you around here.

38:03.074 --> 38:04.450
You just haven't been looking.

38:04.533 --> 38:06.160
Would you like to see my apartment?

38:07.286 --> 38:09.038
I'm not supposed to.

38:10.998 --> 38:13.209
Do you want to come
to my apartment or not?

38:14.794 --> 38:18.965
I'm not supposed to,
but I can make an exception.

38:21.717 --> 38:23.552
Would you take a credit card?

38:24.387 --> 38:27.181
I'm joking. Come on, get in.

38:38.150 --> 38:40.945
I'd like a girl, early twenties, blonde,

38:41.278 --> 38:43.781
who does couples. Couples.

38:43.864 --> 38:48.285
And I really can't stress
"blonde" enough. Blonde.

38:51.247 --> 38:54.542
I'm Paul. My name's Paul Allen.

38:54.625 --> 38:56.502
You got that?

38:56.585 --> 39:00.464
You're Christie.
You're to respond only to Christie.

39:00.548 --> 39:01.966
Is that clear?

39:12.268 --> 39:15.104
That's a very fine chardonnay
you're drinking.

39:15.187 --> 39:17.106
I want you to clean your vagina.

39:25.698 --> 39:29.076
No. From behind. Get on your knees.

39:30.161 --> 39:32.997
You have a very nice body.

39:44.633 --> 39:46.802
Thank you. Send her up.

39:49.972 --> 39:52.892
Christie, get out and dry off,

39:52.975 --> 39:55.978
choose a robe, not the Bijan,

39:56.062 --> 40:00.483
and come and meet me and our guest
in the living room for drinks.

40:07.323 --> 40:09.450
You've arrived! How lovely.

40:09.533 --> 40:11.452
Let me take your coat.

40:11.535 --> 40:14.413
I'm Paul. How good of you to come.

40:19.168 --> 40:21.378
Not quite blonde, are you?

40:21.462 --> 40:23.255
More dirty blonde.

40:23.756 --> 40:26.008
I'm gonna call you Sabrina.

40:26.509 --> 40:28.094
I'm Paul Allen.

40:46.529 --> 40:48.155
So,

40:49.365 --> 40:51.367
don't you want to know what I do?

40:55.079 --> 40:57.873
- No.
- No, not really.

40:59.542 --> 41:04.964
Well, I work on Wall Street
at Pierce & Pierce.

41:05.589 --> 41:07.591
Have you heard of it?

41:16.392 --> 41:19.395
You have a really nice place here, Paul.

41:20.062 --> 41:22.064
How much did you pay for it?

41:22.148 --> 41:26.235
Well, actually,
that's none of your business, Christie.

41:26.610 --> 41:29.822
But I can assure you,
it certainly wasn't cheap.

41:29.905 --> 41:32.241
No. No smoking. Not in here.

41:34.952 --> 41:36.328
Varda truffle?

41:39.039 --> 41:41.750
I don't want you to get drunk,

41:41.834 --> 41:45.462
but that's a very fine chardonnay
you're not drinking.

41:53.053 --> 41:54.889
Do you like Phil Collins?

41:54.972 --> 41:57.349
I've been a big Genesis fan

41:57.433 --> 42:01.520
ever since the release
of their 1980 album, <i>Duke.</i>

42:02.104 --> 42:03.397
Before that,

42:03.480 --> 42:06.525
I really didn't understand any of their work.

42:06.901 --> 42:09.987
It was too artsy. Too intellectual.

42:10.070 --> 42:12.698
It was on <i>Duke</i> where

42:12.781 --> 42:15.701
Phil Collins' presence
became more apparent.

42:18.120 --> 42:20.497
<i>I think Invisible Touch</i>

42:20.581 --> 42:23.500
is the group's undisputed masterpiece.

42:25.461 --> 42:29.298
It's an epic meditation on intangibility.

42:32.509 --> 42:35.346
At the same time, it deepens and enriches

42:35.429 --> 42:38.641
the meaning of the preceding three albums.

42:39.058 --> 42:41.977
Christie, take off the robe.

42:43.646 --> 42:48.984
Listen to the brilliant ensemble playing
of Banks, Collins, and Rutherford.

42:49.652 --> 42:53.239
You can practically hear every nuance
of every instrument.

42:53.656 --> 42:56.075
Sabrina, remove your dress.

42:56.575 --> 43:00.579
In terms of lyrical craftsmanship
and sheer songwriting,

43:00.663 --> 43:03.749
this album hits a new peak
of professionalism.

43:03.832 --> 43:06.252
Sabrina, why don't you dance a little?

43:07.294 --> 43:10.005
<i>Take the lyrics to Land of Confusion.</i>

43:10.089 --> 43:13.259
In this song, Phil Collins
addresses the problems

43:13.342 --> 43:15.761
of abusive political authority.

43:17.846 --> 43:22.434
In <i>Too Deep</i> is the most moving
pop song of the 1980s,

43:22.518 --> 43:25.437
about monogamy and commitment.

43:26.605 --> 43:28.607
The song is extremely uplifting.

43:28.691 --> 43:32.778
Their lyrics are as positive and affirmative

43:32.861 --> 43:36.615
as anything I've heard in rock.

43:40.077 --> 43:42.329
Christie, get down on your knees

43:42.413 --> 43:45.457
so Sabrina can see your asshole.

43:45.541 --> 43:48.210
Phil Collins' solo career

43:48.294 --> 43:50.379
seems to be more commercial,

43:50.462 --> 43:54.300
and therefore more satisfying
in a narrower way.

43:54.383 --> 43:56.885
Especially songs like In The Air Tonight

43:56.969 --> 43:59.471
<i>and Against All Odds.</i>

44:00.889 --> 44:03.559
Sabrina, don't just stare at it. Eat it.

44:05.060 --> 44:07.855
But I also think Phil Collins works best

44:07.938 --> 44:11.942
within the confines of the group
than as a solo artist.

44:12.026 --> 44:15.237
And I stress the word "artist."

44:19.325 --> 44:22.953
This is <i>Sussudio.</i> A great, great song.

44:23.454 --> 44:25.581
A personal favourite.

44:35.799 --> 44:37.593
Look at the camera.

45:15.756 --> 45:18.092
Christie, look at the camera.

45:34.316 --> 45:36.318
Don't touch the watch.

45:58.340 --> 46:00.175
Can we go now?

46:00.259 --> 46:02.261
We're not through yet.

46:20.362 --> 46:23.949
If they have a good personality and they're
not great-looking, then who fucking cares?

46:24.032 --> 46:28.328
Just say, hypothetically, okay,
what if they have a good personality?

46:30.038 --> 46:31.248
I know, I know.

46:31.331 --> 46:34.042
There are no girls with good personalities.

46:34.126 --> 46:35.627
A good personality consists of a chick

46:35.711 --> 46:38.797
with a little hard body
who'll satisfy all sexual demands

46:38.881 --> 46:40.799
without being too slutty about things

46:40.883 --> 46:42.926
and who will essentially keep
her dumb fucking mouth shut.

46:43.010 --> 46:45.512
The only girls with good personalities
who are smart,

46:45.596 --> 46:48.140
or maybe funny or halfway intelligent
or talented,

46:48.223 --> 46:51.268
though God knows what the fuck
that means, are ugly chicks.

46:51.351 --> 46:52.352
Absolutely.

46:52.436 --> 46:55.314
And this is because they have to make up
for how fucking unattractive they are.

46:55.397 --> 46:56.982
You know what Ed Gein said
about women?

46:57.065 --> 46:58.650
Ed Gein? Maitre d' at Canal Bar?

46:58.734 --> 47:01.695
No. Serial killer. Wisconsin, in the '50s.

47:01.778 --> 47:02.821
What did Ed say?

47:02.905 --> 47:04.448
"When I see a pretty girl
walking down the street,

47:04.531 --> 47:08.827
"I think two things. One part of me wants
to take her out and talk to her,

47:08.911 --> 47:11.163
"be real nice and sweet and treat her right."

47:11.246 --> 47:13.332
And what did the other part of him think?

47:13.415 --> 47:15.918
What her head would look like on a stick.

47:20.756 --> 47:24.218
Hi, guys.
I want to get your opinion on something.

47:25.344 --> 47:27.888
It's my business card.

47:27.971 --> 47:30.098
I decided to get a new one, too.

47:33.477 --> 47:34.770
Oh, that's...

47:34.853 --> 47:36.813
Very nice, Luis.

47:38.732 --> 47:40.067
Thank you.

47:54.164 --> 47:55.332
Listen, what about dinner?

47:55.415 --> 47:59.211
Is that all you ever have to contribute?
"What about fucking dinner?"

47:59.294 --> 48:02.130
Cheer up there, Bateman. What's the matter,
no shiatsu this morning?

48:02.214 --> 48:04.007
Keep touching me like that,
and you'll draw back a stump.

48:04.091 --> 48:06.468
- Hold on there, little buddy.
- Excuse me.

48:44.006 --> 48:48.135
God. Patrick. Why here?

48:48.218 --> 48:50.929
I've seen you looking at me.

48:51.013 --> 48:54.933
I've noticed your hot body.

48:56.727 --> 48:58.729
Don't be shy.

48:58.812 --> 49:00.939
You can't imagine
how long I've wanted this,

49:01.023 --> 49:03.567
ever since that Christmas party
at Arizona 206.

49:03.650 --> 49:07.112
You were wearing
that red-striped paisley Armani tie.

49:10.782 --> 49:12.242
I want you.

49:12.743 --> 49:14.953
I want you, too.

49:15.037 --> 49:16.872
- Patrick.
- What is it?

49:18.123 --> 49:19.916
Where are you going?

49:20.542 --> 49:23.128
I've gotta return some videotapes.

49:56.286 --> 49:58.497
Okay, Monday? The 20th.

49:58.580 --> 50:00.165
Monday? That's...

50:00.248 --> 50:03.001
- Any Paul Allen?
- Reservation, no. No reservation, but...

50:03.085 --> 50:05.128
Kimball. I've been wanting to talk with you.

50:05.212 --> 50:08.340
Come into my office.
Jean, great jacket. Matsuda?

50:08.757 --> 50:12.177
Do you remember where you were
the night of Paul's disappearance,

50:12.260 --> 50:14.346
which was on the 20th of December?

50:14.971 --> 50:16.348
God.

50:16.431 --> 50:19.393
I guess I was probably
returning videotapes.

50:22.938 --> 50:25.023
I had a date with a girl named Veronica.

50:25.107 --> 50:27.484
- That's not what I've got.
- What?

50:27.567 --> 50:30.696
That's not the information I've received.

50:30.779 --> 50:33.699
Well, wait.
What information have you received?

50:33.782 --> 50:36.118
Let me see.

50:38.620 --> 50:41.415
- You were with...
- Well, I could be wrong.

50:41.498 --> 50:43.750
When was the last time
you were with Paul Allen?

50:43.834 --> 50:47.796
We'd gone to a new musical called...

50:48.004 --> 50:52.718
O Africa, Brave Africa.
It was a laugh riot. That was about it.

50:53.093 --> 50:54.720
I think we had dinner at Orso's.

50:54.803 --> 50:56.722
No, Petal... No, Orso's.

50:56.805 --> 50:59.850
I hope I've been informative.
Long day. Bit scattered.

50:59.933 --> 51:02.060
I'm a little spent now, too.

51:02.144 --> 51:05.564
But how about lunch in a week or so,

51:05.647 --> 51:07.524
when I've sorted out all this information?

51:07.607 --> 51:08.900
Great. Yes, I'd like that.

51:08.984 --> 51:12.738
And if you could try and pin down
where you were

51:12.821 --> 51:14.740
the night of Paul Allen's disappearance,

51:14.823 --> 51:16.241
it would make my job a lot easier.

51:16.324 --> 51:18.702
Absolutely. I'm with you on that one.

51:23.206 --> 51:25.041
Huey Lewis and the News.

51:27.169 --> 51:30.505
Great stuff. I just bought it on my way here.
You heard it?

51:31.673 --> 51:33.049
Never.

51:33.508 --> 51:35.510
I mean, I don't really like singers.

51:35.594 --> 51:39.097
- Not a big music fan, huh?
- No, I like music.

51:39.181 --> 51:43.727
Just they're...
Huey's too black-sounding for me.

51:44.352 --> 51:45.812
To each his own.

51:47.856 --> 51:50.484
So, lunch next week?

51:50.567 --> 51:52.569
I'll be there.

52:27.521 --> 52:30.232
Will you call me before Easter?

52:30.315 --> 52:31.691
Maybe.

52:35.946 --> 52:37.447
What are you doing tonight?

52:37.531 --> 52:41.535
Dinner at River Caf√©.
Au Bar afterwards, maybe.

52:41.618 --> 52:43.370
That's nice.

52:45.080 --> 52:47.123
I never knew you smoked.

52:48.083 --> 52:50.085
You never noticed.

52:53.296 --> 52:55.674
Listen, Patrick,

52:56.800 --> 52:58.635
can we talk?

53:03.557 --> 53:06.434
You look marvellous.

53:07.853 --> 53:11.773
There's nothing to say.
You're gonna marry Luis.

53:11.857 --> 53:13.775
Isn't that special?

53:15.652 --> 53:16.987
Patrick?

53:21.825 --> 53:23.618
Yes, Courtney?

53:26.204 --> 53:30.709
If I don't see you before Easter,
have a nice one, okay?

53:36.006 --> 53:38.008
You, too.

53:44.598 --> 53:46.057
Patrick?

53:46.558 --> 53:48.226
Yeah?

53:49.477 --> 53:50.937
Nothing.

54:21.843 --> 54:24.095
There's this theory now that
if you can catch the AIDS virus

54:24.179 --> 54:27.599
through having sex with someone,
then you can catch anything.

54:27.682 --> 54:31.770
Alzheimer's, muscular dystrophy,
haemophilia, leukaemia,

54:31.853 --> 54:33.563
diabetes, dyslexia.

54:33.813 --> 54:36.316
I'm not sure,
but I don't think dyslexia's a virus.

54:37.108 --> 54:39.110
Who knows? They don't know that.

54:39.194 --> 54:40.528
Prove it.

54:52.540 --> 54:54.459
- Oh, God!
- What?

54:54.542 --> 54:56.503
It's a fucking milligram of sweetener.

54:56.586 --> 54:57.921
I wanna get high off this,

54:58.004 --> 54:59.756
not sprinkle it on my fucking oatmeal.

54:59.839 --> 55:02.926
It's definitely weak, but I have a feeling
if we do enough of it, we'll be okay.

55:03.009 --> 55:06.304
Can you keep it down?
I'm trying to do drugs!

55:06.388 --> 55:09.516
- Fuck you!
- Calm down. Do it anyway.

55:10.100 --> 55:13.311
That's right. That is, if the faggot
in the next stall thinks it's okay!

55:13.395 --> 55:14.896
- FUCK you!
'Hey, fuck you!

55:17.065 --> 55:19.234
Sorry, dude. The steroids.

55:20.235 --> 55:22.195
Okay, let's do it.

55:43.216 --> 55:44.634
Where did Craig go?

55:44.718 --> 55:47.137
Well, Gorbachev is downstairs.

55:47.220 --> 55:49.764
McDermott went to sign a peace treaty
between the United States and Russia.

55:49.848 --> 55:52.434
He's the one behind Glasnost.

55:52.517 --> 55:55.103
He said he was in mergers
and acquisitions.

55:55.186 --> 55:57.272
You're not confused, are you?

55:57.355 --> 55:58.940
No, not really.

55:59.024 --> 56:01.026
Gorbachev is not downstairs.

56:01.109 --> 56:04.654
Caron's right. Gorbachev's not downstairs.
He's at Tunnel.

56:04.738 --> 56:06.740
Ask me a question.

56:07.949 --> 56:09.617
So, what do you do?

56:09.701 --> 56:13.496
I'm into murders and executions, mostly.

56:13.580 --> 56:17.208
- Do you like it?
- Well, it depends. Why?

56:17.292 --> 56:18.918
Well, most guys I know

56:19.002 --> 56:22.630
who work in mergers and acquisitions
really don't like it.

56:24.799 --> 56:28.595
So, where do you work out?

56:31.890 --> 56:34.476
- You think I'm dumb, don't you?
- What?

56:34.559 --> 56:37.145
You think I'm dumb.
You think all models are dumb.

56:37.228 --> 56:39.898
No. I really don't.

56:39.981 --> 56:42.901
That's okay. I don't mind.

56:42.984 --> 56:44.903
There's something sweet about you.

57:12.430 --> 57:13.723
Doing the crossword?

57:18.311 --> 57:20.355
You need any help?

57:30.990 --> 57:32.158
Jean?

57:32.617 --> 57:33.993
Yes, Patrick?

57:34.077 --> 57:36.663
Would you like to
accompany me to dinner?

57:36.746 --> 57:40.041
That is, if you're not doing anything.

57:41.042 --> 57:43.837
No. No, I don't have any plans.

57:44.879 --> 57:46.756
Well.

57:49.175 --> 57:50.844
Isn't this a coincidence?

57:50.927 --> 57:53.847
- Listen, where should we go?
- Anywhere you want.

57:53.930 --> 57:56.933
Let's not think about what I want.
How about anywhere you want?

57:58.935 --> 58:01.146
I don't know, Patrick.
I can't make this decision.

58:01.229 --> 58:03.189
Come on.

58:03.273 --> 58:06.109
Where do you want to go?
Anywhere you want.

58:06.192 --> 58:09.195
Just say it. I can get us in anywhere.

58:10.071 --> 58:11.739
What about...

58:21.416 --> 58:22.917
Dorsia?

58:28.214 --> 58:29.549
So,

58:30.758 --> 58:33.178
Dorsia is where Jean wants to go.

58:34.053 --> 58:37.140
I don't know.
No, we'll go wherever you want to go.

58:37.223 --> 58:39.100
Dorsia is fine.

58:45.857 --> 58:47.317
<i>Dorsia. Yes?</i>

58:47.400 --> 58:50.320
Yeah, can you take two tonight
at, well, let's say 9:00?

58:50.403 --> 58:53.323
- We 're <i>totally</i> booked.
- Really? That's great.

58:53.406 --> 58:57.035
<i>- No, I said we are totally booked.
- Two at 9:00? Perfect.</i>

58:57.118 --> 58:58.828
See you then.

59:02.123 --> 59:04.083
Yeah.

59:04.167 --> 59:05.335
You're

59:06.753 --> 59:08.254
dressed okay.

59:09.214 --> 59:10.715
You didn't give a name.

59:10.798 --> 59:12.300
They know me.

59:13.259 --> 59:18.264
Why don't you meet me
at my place at 7:00, for drinks.

59:19.515 --> 59:21.142
And, Jean?

59:21.517 --> 59:23.561
You'll want to change before we go out.

59:32.278 --> 59:34.155
Patrick, it's so elegant.

59:34.656 --> 59:36.199
What a wonderful view.

59:36.491 --> 59:37.825
Jean?

59:38.868 --> 59:40.370
Sorbet?

59:42.163 --> 59:44.499
Thanks, Patrick. I'd love some.

59:50.505 --> 59:52.131
Do you want a bite?

59:52.215 --> 59:54.259
I'm on a diet. But thank you.

59:54.342 --> 59:57.929
You don't need to lose any weight.
You're kidding, right?

59:58.012 --> 01:00:00.223
You look great. Very fit.

01:00:01.391 --> 01:00:04.602
You can always be thinner, look better.

01:00:04.686 --> 01:00:07.230
Well, maybe we shouldn't go out to dinner.

01:00:07.313 --> 01:00:09.190
I don't want to ruin your willpower.

01:00:09.274 --> 01:00:11.776
No, it's all right.

01:00:11.859 --> 01:00:14.862
I'm not very good at controlling it anyway.

01:00:17.991 --> 01:00:19.534
So, listen,

01:00:20.326 --> 01:00:22.870
what do you really want
to do with your life?

01:00:23.162 --> 01:00:24.664
Just briefly. Summarise.

01:00:24.747 --> 01:00:27.959
And don't tell me you enjoy
working with children, okay?

01:00:28.334 --> 01:00:31.254
Well, I'd like to travel

01:00:31.337 --> 01:00:35.675
and maybe go back to school,
but I don't really know.

01:00:35.758 --> 01:00:40.513
I'm at a point in my life where there
seems to be so many possibilities.

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:43.516
But I don't know. I'm just so unsure.

01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:49.522
Do you have a boyfriend?

01:00:50.064 --> 01:00:52.025
No, not really.

01:00:52.108 --> 01:00:53.735
Interesting.

01:00:53.818 --> 01:00:57.488
Are you seeing anyone? I mean, seriously?

01:00:58.239 --> 01:00:59.824
Maybe.

01:00:59.907 --> 01:01:01.617
I don't know.

01:01:02.076 --> 01:01:03.453
Not really.

01:01:06.289 --> 01:01:07.332
Jean,

01:01:08.374 --> 01:01:10.793
do you feel fulfilled?

01:01:10.877 --> 01:01:13.671
I mean, in your life?

01:01:13.755 --> 01:01:17.342
I guess I do. For a long time,
I was too focused on my work.

01:01:17.425 --> 01:01:20.720
But now I've really begun to think
about changing myself.

01:01:20.803 --> 01:01:24.682
You know, developing and growing.

01:01:24.766 --> 01:01:26.351
Growing.

01:01:26.434 --> 01:01:28.436
I'm glad you said that.

01:01:31.773 --> 01:01:35.151
Did you know that Ted Bundy's
first dog, a collie,

01:01:35.234 --> 01:01:37.695
was named Lassie?

01:01:37.779 --> 01:01:41.282
- Had you heard this?
- Who's Ted Bundy?

01:01:42.992 --> 01:01:45.453
Forget it.

01:01:47.622 --> 01:01:53.544
- What's that?
- Duct tape. I need it for taping something.

01:01:58.383 --> 01:01:59.842
Patrick?

01:02:01.094 --> 01:02:04.389
Have you ever wanted to
make someone happy?

01:02:04.472 --> 01:02:07.058
What? No! Put it in the carton!

01:02:08.726 --> 01:02:09.977
Sorry.

01:02:12.146 --> 01:02:13.314
Jean?

01:02:14.774 --> 01:02:16.234
What?

01:02:18.194 --> 01:02:20.530
Make someone happy.

01:02:20.613 --> 01:02:22.615
Have you ever wanted to?

01:02:25.493 --> 01:02:27.662
I'm looking for...

01:02:31.499 --> 01:02:34.752
I guess you could say I just want
to have a meaningful relationship

01:02:34.836 --> 01:02:37.171
with someone special.

01:02:46.514 --> 01:02:49.767
<i>Pa trick. Pa trick. I know you're there</i>

01:02:49.851 --> 01:02:52.019
<i>Pick up the phone, you bad boy.</i>

01:02:52.103 --> 01:02:56.357
<i>What are you up to tonight?
It's me. Don't try to hide.</i>

01:02:56.441 --> 01:02:58.443
<i>I hope you're not out
with some little number you picked up,</i>

01:02:58.526 --> 01:03:00.570
<i>because you're mine, Mr Bateman.</i>

01:03:00.653 --> 01:03:03.364
<i>My boy next door.</i>

01:03:03.448 --> 01:03:05.825
<i>Anyway, you never called me,
and you said you would.</i>

01:03:05.908 --> 01:03:08.369
<i>And I'll leave a message
for Jean about this, too, to remind you,</i>

01:03:08.453 --> 01:03:10.830
<i>but we're having dinner
with Melania and Taylor.</i>

01:03:10.913 --> 01:03:13.166
<i>You know Melania.
She went to Sweet Briar.</i>

01:03:13.249 --> 01:03:15.293
<i>And we 're meeting at the Cornell Club,</i>

01:03:15.376 --> 01:03:17.462
<i>so I'll call you tomorrow morning, honey.</i>

01:03:17.545 --> 01:03:20.089
<i>Oh. Sorry. I know you hate that.</i>

01:03:20.173 --> 01:03:23.468
<i>Bye, Patrick. Bye, Mr Big-time CEO.</i>

01:03:23.551 --> 01:03:25.636
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

01:03:29.056 --> 01:03:30.975
Was that Evelyn?

01:03:34.896 --> 01:03:37.231
Are you still seeing her?

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:44.614
I'm sorry. I have no right to ask that.

01:03:49.160 --> 01:03:51.078
Do you want me to go?

01:03:51.996 --> 01:03:53.581
Yeah.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.753
I don't think I can control myself.

01:04:01.005 --> 01:04:02.340
I know. I should go.

01:04:02.423 --> 01:04:06.093
I know I have a tendency to
get involved with unavailable men.

01:04:08.262 --> 01:04:10.097
I mean,

01:04:11.474 --> 01:04:13.476
do you want me to go?

01:04:14.936 --> 01:04:17.271
I think if you stay,

01:04:17.355 --> 01:04:19.524
something bad will happen.

01:04:21.901 --> 01:04:23.569
I think I might hurt you.

01:04:24.779 --> 01:04:26.864
You don't want to get hurt, do you?

01:04:26.948 --> 01:04:29.116
No. No, I guess not

01:04:30.826 --> 01:04:33.162
I don't want to get bruised.

01:04:35.498 --> 01:04:38.459
You're right. I should go.

01:04:44.131 --> 01:04:46.717
Oh. Don't forget you have
a lunch date tomorrow

01:04:46.801 --> 01:04:49.178
with Donald Kimball
at Smith and Wollensky.

01:04:50.054 --> 01:04:51.639
Thanks.

01:04:52.473 --> 01:04:54.642
It slipped my mind completely.

01:05:13.828 --> 01:05:15.204
So,

01:05:16.247 --> 01:05:17.873
the night he disappeared,

01:05:17.957 --> 01:05:20.918
any new thoughts about what you did?

01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:25.590
Not sure. I had a shower

01:05:27.216 --> 01:05:28.426
and some sorbet.

01:05:28.509 --> 01:05:30.261
I think you're getting your dates mixed up.

01:05:30.344 --> 01:05:35.558
Well, where do you place Paul that night?

01:05:35.641 --> 01:05:38.936
According to his date book,
and this was verified by his secretary,

01:05:39.020 --> 01:05:42.106
he had dinner with Marcus Halberstram.

01:05:42.189 --> 01:05:44.025
- And?
- I questioned him.

01:05:44.900 --> 01:05:46.736
- Marcus.
- Yes, and he denies it.

01:05:46.819 --> 01:05:49.196
Though, at first, he couldn't be sure.

01:05:49.280 --> 01:05:51.782
- But he denied it?
- Yes.

01:05:52.992 --> 01:05:56.954
- Well, does Marcus have an alibi?
- Yes.

01:05:57.038 --> 01:06:00.374
- He does? You're sure?
- I've checked it out. It's clean.

01:06:04.629 --> 01:06:07.715
Now, where were you?

01:06:09.175 --> 01:06:10.635
Where was Marcus?

01:06:10.718 --> 01:06:12.470
He wasn't with Paul Allen.

01:06:12.553 --> 01:06:13.888
Who was he with?

01:06:13.971 --> 01:06:16.432
He was at Atlantis

01:06:16.849 --> 01:06:19.518
with Craig McDermott, Frederick Dibble,

01:06:19.602 --> 01:06:21.312
Harry Newman, George Butner,

01:06:21.395 --> 01:06:23.981
and you.

01:06:28.277 --> 01:06:30.404
Oh, right, yeah. Of course.

01:06:31.614 --> 01:06:33.574
He had wanted Paul Allen to come,

01:06:34.367 --> 01:06:36.494
but he had made plans,

01:06:36.577 --> 01:06:40.539
and I guess I had dinner
with Victoria the following night.

01:06:40.623 --> 01:06:43.250
Personally, I think the guy
went a little nutso,

01:06:43.334 --> 01:06:44.377
split town for a while.

01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:47.546
Maybe he did go to London,
sightseeing, drinking, whatever.

01:06:47.630 --> 01:06:50.424
Anyway, I'm pretty sure
he'll turn up sooner or later.

01:06:50.841 --> 01:06:53.844
I mean, to think that one
of his friends killed him

01:06:53.928 --> 01:06:57.515
for no reason whatsoever
would be too ridiculous.

01:06:57.807 --> 01:07:00.059
Isn't that right, Patrick?

01:07:21.455 --> 01:07:23.290
Christie. Christie!

01:07:23.374 --> 01:07:27.211
I'm not so sure about this.
I had to go to Emergency after last time.

01:07:27.294 --> 01:07:29.880
This won't be anything like last time.
I promise.

01:07:29.964 --> 01:07:32.842
I don't think so.

01:07:32.925 --> 01:07:35.928
Just come in the limo
and talk to me for a minute.

01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:38.472
The driver's here. You're safe.

01:07:56.991 --> 01:07:59.368
Nothing like last time. I promise.

01:07:59.452 --> 01:08:01.370
All right.

01:08:01.454 --> 01:08:04.749
So, you're looking great. How've you been?

01:08:04.832 --> 01:08:07.835
Well, I actually might need
a little surgery after last time.

01:08:07.918 --> 01:08:11.672
- Really?
- My friend told me I should get a lawyer.

01:08:12.923 --> 01:08:15.760
Lawyers are so complicated.

01:08:15.843 --> 01:08:17.344
Don't do that.

01:08:18.386 --> 01:08:20.055
Here's a cheque.

01:09:09.563 --> 01:09:12.066
Half now, half later.

01:09:17.154 --> 01:09:20.658
Okay. Your name's Christie.

01:09:20.741 --> 01:09:23.452
We're meeting a friend of mine, Elizabeth.

01:09:23.536 --> 01:09:27.997
She'll be joining us
in my new apartment shortly.

01:09:28.082 --> 01:09:31.377
You'll like her. She's a very nice girl.

01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:41.095
You look really familiar.
Did you go to Dalton?

01:09:43.264 --> 01:09:46.183
I think I met you at the Surf Bar, didn't I?
With Spicey?

01:09:46.267 --> 01:09:49.562
Maybe not with Spicey, but definitely
at Surf Bar. You know, Surf Bar?

01:09:49.645 --> 01:09:51.814
Anyway, Surf Bar sucks now. It's terrible.

01:09:51.897 --> 01:09:55.943
Went to a birthday party there
for Malcolm Forbes. Oh, my God, please.

01:09:57.027 --> 01:09:59.697
This is nicer than your other apartment.

01:10:01.949 --> 01:10:04.034
Well, it's not that nice.

01:10:08.622 --> 01:10:10.207
Where did you two meet?

01:10:10.291 --> 01:10:12.835
Oh, God. We met at...

01:10:12.918 --> 01:10:16.881
Oh, God, at the Kentucky Derby
in '85 or '86.

01:10:16.964 --> 01:10:19.258
You were hanging out
with that bimbo Allison Poole.

01:10:19.341 --> 01:10:22.553
- Hot number.
- What do you mean? She was a hot number.

01:10:22.636 --> 01:10:24.555
If you had a platinum card,
she'd give you a blowjob.

01:10:24.638 --> 01:10:27.308
This girl worked at a tanning salon.
Need I say more?

01:10:27.683 --> 01:10:29.560
What do you do?

01:10:29.977 --> 01:10:32.229
She's my

01:10:32.313 --> 01:10:33.981
cousin.

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:37.026
She's from

01:10:37.109 --> 01:10:38.110
France.

01:10:38.861 --> 01:10:41.488
Where's your phone? I've gotta call Harley.

01:10:46.368 --> 01:10:48.746
Where do you summer? Southampton?

01:10:49.538 --> 01:10:50.748
No.

01:10:50.831 --> 01:10:54.501
- Oh, God. It's his machine.
- Elizabeth, it's 3.00 in the morning.

01:10:54.585 --> 01:10:57.087
He's a goddamn drug dealer.
These are his peak hours.

01:10:57.171 --> 01:10:59.548
- Don't tell him you're here.
- Why would I?

01:10:59.632 --> 01:11:01.008
This tastes weird.

01:11:01.091 --> 01:11:03.093
Harley, it's me. I need your services.

01:11:03.177 --> 01:11:05.429
Translate that however you want.

01:11:05.512 --> 01:11:07.348
I'm at...

01:11:08.682 --> 01:11:10.601
- You're at Paul Allen's.
- Who?

01:11:10.684 --> 01:11:13.187
- Paul Allen.
- I want the number, idiot.

01:11:13.270 --> 01:11:15.564
Anyway, I'm at Paul Normand's,
and I'll try you again later.

01:11:15.648 --> 01:11:19.610
If I don't see you at Canal Bar tomorrow
night, I'm gonna sic my hairdresser on you.

01:11:19.693 --> 01:11:23.322
Did you know that guy who disappeared?
Didn't he work at Pierce & Pierce?

01:11:23.405 --> 01:11:26.283
- Was he a friend of yours?
- No.

01:11:26.367 --> 01:11:28.994
Do you have any coke? Or Halcion?

01:11:29.078 --> 01:11:30.955
Oh, I would take a Halcion.

01:11:31.038 --> 01:11:32.706
Listen.

01:11:34.208 --> 01:11:36.126
I would just like to see

01:11:36.210 --> 01:11:38.754
the two of you get it on.

01:11:41.090 --> 01:11:42.299
What's wrong with that?

01:11:42.383 --> 01:11:43.968
It's totally disease-free.

01:11:46.220 --> 01:11:49.181
- Patrick, you're a lunatic.
- Come on.

01:11:49.515 --> 01:11:51.600
Don't you find Christie attractive?

01:11:51.684 --> 01:11:55.437
Let's not get lewd.
I'm in no mood for a lewd conversation.

01:11:55.521 --> 01:11:57.940
Come on.

01:11:58.023 --> 01:12:00.109
I think it'd be a turn-on.

01:12:00.192 --> 01:12:01.777
Does he do this all the time?

01:12:04.405 --> 01:12:07.199
Christie, you're not drinking your wine.

01:12:08.742 --> 01:12:11.078
You're telling me
you've never gotten it on with a girl?

01:12:11.161 --> 01:12:13.998
No. I'm not a lesbian.

01:12:14.081 --> 01:12:17.167
Why would you think I would be into that?

01:12:17.251 --> 01:12:19.044
Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence,
for one thing.

01:12:19.128 --> 01:12:21.964
Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick.

01:12:22.047 --> 01:12:24.341
You're making me feel weird.

01:12:28.929 --> 01:12:30.347
Did you know

01:12:30.973 --> 01:12:33.934
that Whitney Houston's debut LP,

01:12:34.018 --> 01:12:37.229
<i>called simply Whitney Houston,</i>

01:12:37.312 --> 01:12:40.232
had four number-one singles on it?

01:12:41.567 --> 01:12:43.527
Did you know that, Christie?

01:12:43.610 --> 01:12:46.697
You actually listen to Whitney Houston?

01:12:47.156 --> 01:12:50.117
You own a Whitney Houston CD?

01:12:51.285 --> 01:12:52.870
More than one?

01:12:54.621 --> 01:12:57.499
It's hard to choose a favourite
among so many great tracks,

01:13:00.127 --> 01:13:02.463
<i>but The Greatest Love of All</i>

01:13:02.546 --> 01:13:07.342
is one of the best,
most powerful songs ever written

01:13:07.426 --> 01:13:11.346
about self-preservation, dignity.

01:13:11.430 --> 01:13:15.225
Its universal message
crosses all boundaries

01:13:15.309 --> 01:13:18.979
and instils one with the hope

01:13:19.063 --> 01:13:22.566
that it's not too late to better ourselves.

01:13:23.650 --> 01:13:26.820
Since, Elizabeth,

01:13:26.904 --> 01:13:30.282
it's impossible in this world we live in

01:13:30.365 --> 01:13:32.451
to empathize with others,

01:13:32.534 --> 01:13:35.287
we can always empathize with ourselves.

01:13:35.746 --> 01:13:37.623
It's an important message.

01:13:38.665 --> 01:13:40.125
Crucial, really.

01:13:42.795 --> 01:13:45.672
And it's beautifully stated on the album.

01:14:56.827 --> 01:14:58.537
Not the face, you bitch!

01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:02.166
Not the fucking face,
you piece of bitch trash!

01:16:30.879 --> 01:16:33.590
I want a firm commitment.

01:16:33.674 --> 01:16:35.425
I think, Evelyn,

01:16:35.509 --> 01:16:37.761
that we've lost touch.

01:16:37.844 --> 01:16:39.513
Why? What's wrong?

01:16:42.683 --> 01:16:44.601
My need to engage in homicidal behaviour

01:16:44.685 --> 01:16:47.479
on a massive scale cannot be corrected,

01:16:47.562 --> 01:16:50.524
but I have no other way to fulfil my needs.

01:16:52.276 --> 01:16:55.070
- We need to talk.
- Talk about what, Patrick?

01:16:55.445 --> 01:16:57.239
It's over, Evelyn.

01:16:57.322 --> 01:16:59.950
It's all over.

01:17:00.367 --> 01:17:03.120
Touchy, touchy.
I'm sorry I brought up the wedding.

01:17:03.203 --> 01:17:07.124
Let's just avoid the issue, all right?
Now, are we having coffee?

01:17:07.207 --> 01:17:09.626
I'm fucking serious. It's fucking over. Us.

01:17:09.710 --> 01:17:13.255
This is no joke.

01:17:13.338 --> 01:17:15.299
I don't think we should
see each other any more.

01:17:15.382 --> 01:17:19.594
But your friends are my friends,
and my friends are your friends.

01:17:20.178 --> 01:17:23.390
I really don't think it would work.
You have a little something...

01:17:23.473 --> 01:17:26.184
I know that your friends are my friends,

01:17:26.268 --> 01:17:28.562
and I've thought about that.

01:17:29.396 --> 01:17:31.398
You can have them.

01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:35.068
- You're really serious, aren't you?
- Yes, I am.

01:17:38.697 --> 01:17:41.408
What about the past? Our past?

01:17:41.491 --> 01:17:43.410
We never really shared one.

01:17:43.493 --> 01:17:44.995
- You're inhuman.
- No.

01:17:45.078 --> 01:17:46.955
I'm in touch with humanity.

01:17:48.206 --> 01:17:50.000
Evelyn, I'm sorry.

01:17:50.083 --> 01:17:51.418
I just...

01:17:53.128 --> 01:17:55.339
You're not terribly important to me.

01:17:55.422 --> 01:17:57.090
Oh, no!

01:17:57.466 --> 01:17:59.593
No! No!

01:18:00.427 --> 01:18:05.015
I know my behaviour
can be erratic sometimes.

01:18:05.807 --> 01:18:09.227
What do you want me to do?
What is it that you want?

01:18:09.311 --> 01:18:12.481
If you really want to do something for me,
then stop making this scene right now.

01:18:12.564 --> 01:18:15.817
- Oh, God, I can't believe this.
- I'm leaving.

01:18:15.901 --> 01:18:18.653
I've assessed the situation, and I'm going.

01:18:18.737 --> 01:18:21.031
- Where are you going?
- Just leaving.

01:18:21.698 --> 01:18:22.866
But where?

01:18:24.368 --> 01:18:26.787
I have to return some videotapes.

01:18:57.484 --> 01:18:59.486
Here, kitty, kitty.

01:19:15.794 --> 01:19:18.213
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

01:19:18.296 --> 01:19:19.589
Stop that.

01:20:01.882 --> 01:20:04.009
Drop the weapon! Drop it now!

01:20:04.092 --> 01:20:06.219
Get on the ground! Put...

01:20:49.262 --> 01:20:51.681
Burning the midnight oil, Mr Smith?

01:20:51.765 --> 01:20:54.434
Hey, now don't forget to sign in.

01:21:34.474 --> 01:21:36.017
Hi.

01:22:23.064 --> 01:22:27.152
Harold, it's Bateman. Patrick Bateman.

01:22:27.235 --> 01:22:29.946
You're my lawyer, so I think
you should know, I've killed a lot of people.

01:22:30.030 --> 01:22:32.574
Some escort girls in an apartment uptown,

01:22:34.326 --> 01:22:36.411
some homeless people, maybe five or ten,

01:22:36.494 --> 01:22:38.204
an NYU girl I met in Central Park,

01:22:38.288 --> 01:22:40.457
I left her in a parking lot
behind some doughnut shop.

01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:43.835
I killed Bethany,
my old girlfriend, with a nail gun,

01:22:43.918 --> 01:22:48.131
and some man...
Some old faggot with a dog.

01:22:48.214 --> 01:22:52.302
Last week, I... I killed another girl

01:22:52.385 --> 01:22:54.387
with a chain saw.

01:22:56.765 --> 01:22:59.934
I had to. She almost got away.

01:23:02.354 --> 01:23:04.189
Someone else there. I can't remember.

01:23:04.272 --> 01:23:07.525
Maybe a model. But she's dead, too.

01:23:07.901 --> 01:23:10.111
And Paul Allen.

01:23:10.195 --> 01:23:13.948
I killed Paul Allen with an axe in the face.

01:23:14.032 --> 01:23:18.078
His body is dissolving
in a bathtub in Hell's Kitchen.

01:23:18.536 --> 01:23:20.288
I don't want to leave anything out here.

01:23:20.372 --> 01:23:23.166
I guess I've killed maybe 20 people,

01:23:23.249 --> 01:23:25.251
maybe 40.

01:23:26.836 --> 01:23:29.839
I have tapes of a lot of it.

01:23:29.923 --> 01:23:32.425
Some of the girls have seen the tapes.

01:23:32.509 --> 01:23:34.427
I even...

01:23:42.268 --> 01:23:44.479
I ate some of their brains.

01:23:45.980 --> 01:23:48.274
And I tried to cook a little.

01:23:51.027 --> 01:23:52.612
Tonight, I...

01:23:54.114 --> 01:23:59.411
I just had to kill a lot of people, and...

01:24:03.540 --> 01:24:08.545
I'm not sure
I'm gonna get away with it this time.

01:24:11.631 --> 01:24:14.509
So, I mean...

01:24:16.219 --> 01:24:18.179
I guess

01:24:18.263 --> 01:24:20.014
I'm a pretty...

01:24:21.891 --> 01:24:24.477
I mean, I guess I'm a pretty sick guy.

01:24:26.563 --> 01:24:29.065
So,

01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:31.317
if you get back tomorrow,

01:24:32.318 --> 01:24:34.404
I may show up at Harry's Bar.

01:24:34.487 --> 01:24:36.197
So, you know.

01:24:37.574 --> 01:24:39.868
Keep your eyes open.

01:26:59.257 --> 01:27:01.634
Are you my 2:00?

01:27:01.718 --> 01:27:02.927
No.

01:27:04.637 --> 01:27:06.723
Can I help you?

01:27:06.806 --> 01:27:11.060
I'm looking for Paul Allen's place.

01:27:11.728 --> 01:27:14.188
Doesn't he live here?

01:27:14.272 --> 01:27:16.065
No, he doesn't.

01:27:16.357 --> 01:27:18.985
You sure?

01:27:19.068 --> 01:27:21.112
You saw the ad in the Times?

01:27:21.195 --> 01:27:24.407
No. Yeah. I mean, yeah.

01:27:25.283 --> 01:27:28.786
<i>- In the Times.
- There was no ad in the Times.</i>

01:27:29.245 --> 01:27:31.414
I think you should go now.

01:27:31.497 --> 01:27:33.166
But I think...

01:27:35.752 --> 01:27:37.378
I want to know what happened here.

01:27:37.462 --> 01:27:40.423
Don't make any trouble, please.

01:27:40.506 --> 01:27:42.508
I suggest you 9¬∞-

01:27:55.438 --> 01:27:56.814
Don't come back.

01:27:56.898 --> 01:27:59.067
I won't.

01:27:59.150 --> 01:28:00.818
Don't worry.

01:28:31.307 --> 01:28:32.350
Patrick Bateman's office.

01:28:32.433 --> 01:28:36.104
- Jean? I need help.
- Patrick, is that you?

01:28:37.230 --> 01:28:38.815
Jean, I'm not...

01:28:40.024 --> 01:28:41.859
Craig McDermott called.
He wants to meet you,

01:28:41.943 --> 01:28:44.278
David Van Patten, and Tim Bryce
at Harry's for drinks.

01:28:44.362 --> 01:28:45.947
Oh, God.

01:28:46.030 --> 01:28:48.700
What did you say, you dumb bitch?

01:28:48.783 --> 01:28:52.412
<i>- Patrick, I can't hear you.
- What am I doing?</i>

01:28:52.495 --> 01:28:54.497
Where are you, Patrick? What's wrong?

01:28:56.374 --> 01:29:00.211
I don't think I'm gonna make it, Jean,

01:29:00.294 --> 01:29:03.006
to the office this afternoon.

01:29:03.089 --> 01:29:05.049
VVhy?

01:29:05.133 --> 01:29:07.468
<i>Just say no!</i>

01:29:08.553 --> 01:29:10.096
What is it, Patrick? Are you all right?

01:29:10.805 --> 01:29:14.726
Stop sounding so fucking sad!

01:29:14.809 --> 01:29:16.102
<i>Jesus!</i>

01:30:33.513 --> 01:30:34.555
Table for three.

01:30:34.639 --> 01:30:37.934
Bateman, you look a little wild-eyed.
Rough day at the office?

01:30:38.017 --> 01:30:40.478
Look, Bryce is back,
and he's drinking mineral water.

01:30:40.561 --> 01:30:44.690
He's a changed man, except he still
can't get a reservation to save his life.

01:30:44.774 --> 01:30:46.776
Why don't you just try 150 Wooster?

01:30:46.859 --> 01:30:49.779
I'm not going anywhere
unless we have a reservation.

01:30:49.862 --> 01:30:52.615
Le Cirque, Flamingo East, Oyster Bar.

01:30:52.698 --> 01:30:54.283
Come on, faggots, let's get a res.

01:30:54.367 --> 01:30:57.120
Keep your shirt on.
Maybe lose the suspenders.

01:30:58.121 --> 01:30:59.622
Need a reservation for 8:30.

01:30:59.705 --> 01:31:02.542
Excuse me, gentlemen. Right back.

01:31:02.959 --> 01:31:04.877
10:00 would not be any good, no.

01:31:04.961 --> 01:31:06.337
Just fucking call them.

01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:08.047
- Give me the phone. I'll do it.
- I'll call you back.

01:31:08.131 --> 01:31:11.968
Face it. The Japanese will own most
of this country by the end of the '90s.

01:31:12.051 --> 01:31:14.720
Shut up, Carnes. They will not.

01:31:16.264 --> 01:31:20.059
So, Harold, did you get my message?

01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:22.937
Jesus, yes! That was hilarious.

01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:25.189
- That was you, wasn't it?
- Yeah, naturally.

01:31:25.273 --> 01:31:28.067
Bateman killing Allen and the escort girls.
That's fabulous.

01:31:28.151 --> 01:31:30.194
- That's rich.
- What exactly do you mean?

01:31:30.278 --> 01:31:33.156
The message you left.
By the way, Davis, how's Cynthia?

01:31:33.239 --> 01:31:36.909
- You're still seeing her, right?
- Wait, Harold. What do you mean?

01:31:36.993 --> 01:31:40.329
Excuse me. Nothing. It's good to see you.

01:31:40.413 --> 01:31:42.123
Is that Edward Towers?

01:31:43.332 --> 01:31:44.792
Wait.

01:31:45.001 --> 01:31:46.544
Davis.

01:31:47.503 --> 01:31:49.505
I'm not one to bad-mouth anyone.

01:31:49.589 --> 01:31:52.133
Your joke was amusing, but come on, man.

01:31:52.216 --> 01:31:54.677
You had one fatal flaw.

01:31:55.094 --> 01:31:57.013
Bateman is such a dork.

01:31:57.597 --> 01:32:00.683
Such a boring, spineless lightweight.

01:32:00.766 --> 01:32:04.770
Now if you said Bryce or McDermott...
Otherwise, it was amusing.

01:32:04.854 --> 01:32:07.356
Now if you'll excuse me,
I really must be going.

01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:08.774
Wait.

01:32:10.067 --> 01:32:12.195
Stop.

01:32:12.278 --> 01:32:14.197
I did it, Carnes.

01:32:15.323 --> 01:32:16.866
I killed him.

01:32:16.949 --> 01:32:19.702
I'm Patrick Bateman.

01:32:22.622 --> 01:32:24.957
I chopped Allen's fucking head off.

01:32:26.209 --> 01:32:31.130
The whole message
I left on your machine was true.

01:32:31.464 --> 01:32:34.133
Excuse me. I really must be going now.

01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:37.261
No, listen.

01:32:37.345 --> 01:32:39.972
Don't you know who I am?

01:32:40.056 --> 01:32:42.850
I'm not Davis. I'm Patrick Bateman.

01:32:45.645 --> 01:32:48.814
We talk on the phone all the time.

01:32:49.148 --> 01:32:50.816
Don't you recognise me?

01:32:52.902 --> 01:32:54.654
You're my lawyer.

01:32:56.322 --> 01:32:58.574
Now, Carnes,

01:32:58.658 --> 01:33:00.201
listen.

01:33:00.284 --> 01:33:02.495
Listen very, very carefully.

01:33:06.374 --> 01:33:08.292
I killed Paul Allen,

01:33:10.294 --> 01:33:11.796
and I liked it.

01:33:12.672 --> 01:33:15.716
I can't make myself any clearer.

01:33:15.800 --> 01:33:18.177
But that's simply not possible.

01:33:18.261 --> 01:33:19.804
And I don't find this funny any more.

01:33:19.887 --> 01:33:22.181
It never was supposed to be.

01:33:22.265 --> 01:33:24.308
- Why isn't it possible?
- It's just not.

01:33:24.392 --> 01:33:27.853
Why not, you stupid bastard?

01:33:28.354 --> 01:33:32.942
Because I had dinner with Paul Allen
twice in London, just 10 days ago.

01:33:33.025 --> 01:33:35.027
No, you...

01:33:37.697 --> 01:33:38.739
Didn't.

01:33:38.823 --> 01:33:40.825
Now, if you'll excuse me.

01:34:21.699 --> 01:34:23.868
<i>We've seen the results of that mistrust</i>

01:34:23.951 --> 01:34:27.580
<i>in the form of lies, divisions, and mistakes.</i>

01:34:27.663 --> 01:34:29.665
<i>We need to find a way to cooperate</i>

01:34:29.749 --> 01:34:32.001
<i>while realising foreign policy</i>

01:34:32.084 --> 01:34:34.670
<i>can't be run by committee.</i>

01:34:34.754 --> 01:34:37.298
<i>And I believe there's now
the growing sense</i>

01:34:37.381 --> 01:34:41.052
<i>that we can accomplish more
by cooperating.</i>

01:34:41.135 --> 01:34:45.514
<i>And, in the end, this may be
the eventual blessing in disguise</i>

01:34:45.598 --> 01:34:47.350
<i>to come out of the Iran-Contra mess</i>

01:34:47.433 --> 01:34:49.602
How can he lie like that?

01:34:51.187 --> 01:34:53.147
- How can he pull that shit?
- What shit?

01:34:53.230 --> 01:34:55.691
Now where do we have reservations at?

01:34:55.775 --> 01:34:58.194
I'm not really hungry, but I'd like
to have reservations someplace.

01:34:58.277 --> 01:35:01.197
How can you be so fucking...

01:35:01.280 --> 01:35:03.866
I don't know... Cool about it?

01:35:03.949 --> 01:35:06.535
Some guys are just born cool, I guess.

01:35:12.124 --> 01:35:13.250
Bateman?

01:35:14.502 --> 01:35:16.379
What are you so fucking zany about?

01:35:16.462 --> 01:35:19.298
I'm just a happy camper.

01:35:19.382 --> 01:35:21.050
Rockin' and a-rollin'!

01:35:22.885 --> 01:35:24.470
Oh, brother! Look.

01:35:24.553 --> 01:35:27.390
He presents himself
as this harmless old codger,

01:35:27.473 --> 01:35:29.725
but inside...

01:35:29.809 --> 01:35:31.602
But inside...

01:35:32.144 --> 01:35:34.313
<i>But inside doesn't matter.</i>

01:35:35.314 --> 01:35:39.735
Inside? Yes? Inside? Believe it or not,
Bryce, we're actually listening to you.

01:35:39.819 --> 01:35:42.446
Come on, Bateman, what do you think?

01:35:45.074 --> 01:35:46.492
Whatever.

01:35:46.575 --> 01:35:49.036
Whose moronic idea was it
to order dry beers?

01:35:49.995 --> 01:35:51.664
I need a scotch.

01:35:53.165 --> 01:35:55.626
<i>When I named him to
the U. S. Court of Appeals,</i>

01:35:55.709 --> 01:35:58.170
<i>the American Bar Association...</i>

01:36:07.555 --> 01:36:10.599
<i>There are no more barriers to cross.</i>

01:36:10.683 --> 01:36:13.185
<i>All I have in common
with the uncontrollable</i>

01:36:13.269 --> 01:36:16.272
<i>and the insane, the vicious and the evil,</i>

01:36:16.355 --> 01:36:20.109
<i>all the mayhem I have caused
and my utter indifference toward it,</i>

01:36:20.192 --> 01:36:22.528
<i>I have now surpassed.</i>

01:36:25.448 --> 01:36:28.284
<i>My pain is constant and sharp,</i>

01:36:28.367 --> 01:36:32.079
<i>and I do not hope
for a better world for anyone.</i>

01:36:32.163 --> 01:36:36.750
<i>In fact, I want my pain
to be inflicted on others.</i>

01:36:36.834 --> 01:36:39.044
<i>I want no one to escape.</i>

01:36:41.213 --> 01:36:43.340
<i>But even after admitting this,</i>

01:36:43.424 --> 01:36:45.593
<i>there is no catharsis.</i>

01:36:45.676 --> 01:36:48.429
<i>My punishment continues to elude me,</i>

01:36:48.512 --> 01:36:51.765
<i>and I gain no deeper knowledge of myself.</i>

01:36:51.849 --> 01:36:55.644
<i>No new knowledge can be
extracted from my telling.</i>

01:36:55.728 --> 01:36:59.857
<i>This confession has meant nothing.</i>
