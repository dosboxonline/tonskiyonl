WEBVTT

00:06.093 --> 00:08.573
I can't believe this is
our last Calculus class.

00:08.573 --> 00:09.922
Well, don't worry.

00:09.922 --> 00:11.228
If it's anything
like the others,

00:11.228 --> 00:12.577
it'll feel like
a lifetime.

00:14.666 --> 00:17.887
I'm going to miss
all your little jokes,
Steve Smith.

00:17.887 --> 00:20.194
I still can't believe
you're about to graduate.

00:20.194 --> 00:22.761
And follow Billie Eilish
on tour!

00:22.761 --> 00:24.154
So cool!

00:24.154 --> 00:25.590
I'm hoping to meet her

00:25.590 --> 00:27.810
'cause I think she knows
who my real dad is.

00:28.811 --> 00:30.073
I know it's the last day,

00:30.073 --> 00:33.076
but I'm gonna have to
reteach you everything!

00:33.076 --> 00:35.209
I just found out that at
the start of the school year,

00:35.209 --> 00:37.080
one of my colleagues
pranked me and switched

00:37.080 --> 00:40.170
my teacher's edition
with one full of bullshit,

00:40.170 --> 00:42.607
and that's what I've been
teaching you all year.

00:42.607 --> 00:45.219
Thank God none of us
were paying attention,
am I right?

00:45.219 --> 00:47.090
That's it.

00:47.090 --> 00:49.962
You guys don't respect me,
I don't make squat,

00:49.962 --> 00:52.704
and I have to cram for my test
on the milkshake machine

00:52.704 --> 00:55.098
before my shift
at Bobby Freeze,

00:55.098 --> 00:57.840
which starts in
nine minutes?

01:00.016 --> 01:01.974
Hey, are you going to

01:01.974 --> 01:04.281
Vince Chung's
end-of-the-year bash
tonight?

01:04.281 --> 01:05.543
I doubt it.

01:05.543 --> 01:07.067
His party is
invite-only

01:07.067 --> 01:08.938
and he only liked me
when I had boobs.

01:11.114 --> 01:14.552
Tell you what,
since you've been
making me laugh all year

01:14.552 --> 01:15.988
and it is our last
week together

01:15.988 --> 01:17.990
before I follow Billie
on the road,

01:17.990 --> 01:21.298
if you do show up to
Vince Chung's party tonight...

01:21.298 --> 01:23.953
I'll give you
a handjob...

01:24.780 --> 01:31.656
<i>Handjob...</i>

01:36.139 --> 01:38.968
<i>♪ Good morning, USA</i>

01:38.968 --> 01:42.319
<i>♪ I got a feeling
That it's gonna be
A wonderful day</i>

01:42.319 --> 01:45.453
<i>♪ The sun in the sky
Has a smile on his face</i>

01:45.453 --> 01:49.196
<i>♪ And he's shinin' a salute
To the American race</i>

01:51.981 --> 01:55.158
<i>♪ Oh, boy, it's swell to say</i>

01:55.158 --> 01:57.595
<i>♪ Good morning, USA</i>

01:57.595 --> 01:58.640
Ah!

02:00.337 --> 02:03.210
<i>♪ Good morning, USA</i>

02:04.036 --> 02:05.255
This is it, man!

02:05.255 --> 02:07.257
It's finally happening
for you!

02:07.257 --> 02:10.042
You're going to
become a man!

02:10.042 --> 02:11.783
I'm not gonna lie, Snot.

02:11.783 --> 02:13.350
When you got Bar mitzvah'd
last year

02:13.350 --> 02:16.614
and became a man
the Jewish way,
I was very jealous.

02:16.614 --> 02:20.183
And now it's your turn
to do it one
of the Christian ways.

02:20.183 --> 02:23.055
But how are we gonna
get an invite to
Vince Chung's party?

02:23.055 --> 02:24.883
It'd be one thing
if Barry were here.

02:24.883 --> 02:26.537
Vince Chung loves Barry.

02:26.537 --> 02:29.279
Apparently if you witness
one murder at Taco Bell

02:29.279 --> 02:32.152
with someone, it creates
some sort of "bond."

02:32.152 --> 02:35.807
Too bad he and Toshi already
left for Summer Horse Camp.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.200
I'll text him.

02:37.200 --> 02:39.202
I'm warning you, bud,
if you text

02:39.202 --> 02:43.380
Barry at camp,
you're just gonna
get a hundred horse photos.

02:49.517 --> 02:51.693
What a ride, Pepper!

02:51.693 --> 02:53.825
This is why we
do it, Tosh.

02:53.825 --> 02:56.219
The union of
man and beast.

02:56.219 --> 03:00.180
Sometimes I don't know
where I end
and my horse begins.

03:05.576 --> 03:07.752
You guys?
No way!

03:07.752 --> 03:10.538
Only cools get to go
to my party, bros.

03:10.538 --> 03:13.932
Oh, dude, you're the guy
who caught that bird

03:13.932 --> 03:16.761
with your bare hand
in PE class.

03:16.761 --> 03:20.069
Please come to my bash.

03:20.069 --> 03:22.941
Vince, please, it's the
difference between
my friend

03:22.941 --> 03:24.508
becoming a man or not.

03:24.508 --> 03:25.770
Tell you what,
I'll let you guys

03:25.770 --> 03:28.425
come to my party
under one condition.

03:28.425 --> 03:30.079
You bring a keg

03:30.079 --> 03:32.603
of OG Four Loco!

03:35.432 --> 03:39.349
Okay, we just have
to get a keg of OG Four Loco,
whatever that is.

03:40.959 --> 03:44.136
You think you two nerds
can get a keg of OG Four Loco?

03:44.136 --> 03:46.443
The one with caffeine,
taurine, and guarana?

03:46.443 --> 03:47.749
Yes?

03:47.749 --> 03:49.533
I happen to know
there's only one place

03:49.533 --> 03:52.057
within a 100-mile radius
that has it.

03:52.057 --> 03:56.061
A dirty dive bar in Chimdale
called Triple-X-X.

03:56.061 --> 03:57.889
That's four X's.

03:57.889 --> 04:00.457
It used to be called Triple-X
in honor of the
Vin Diesel movie,

04:00.457 --> 04:02.285
but they got into trouble with
Columbia Pictures

04:02.285 --> 04:04.809
and had to add
the extra X.

04:04.809 --> 04:05.984
Oh.

04:05.984 --> 04:08.160
Good luck buying
a keg there underage.

04:08.160 --> 04:10.075
It's a fake ID graveyard.

04:10.075 --> 04:12.164
Even the ones I sell
don't work there.

04:12.164 --> 04:14.166
Alright,
see you chodes later.

04:14.166 --> 04:15.646
I'm off to eavesdrop
on more students

04:15.646 --> 04:17.735
and spread more
dangerous legends.

04:17.735 --> 04:19.302
Alright,
you heard him.

04:19.302 --> 04:22.131
If we're going to make you
a man, we need real IDs.

04:22.131 --> 04:25.003
I think it's time we talk
to my Uncle Roger.

04:25.003 --> 04:26.309
They're so cool.
I wish...

04:26.309 --> 04:28.833
Mark McKenzie,
you talking switchblades?

04:28.833 --> 04:30.835
The ice cream man
will sell you one

04:30.835 --> 04:33.011
if you know
the secret password.

04:33.011 --> 04:34.274
Butterball.

04:37.320 --> 04:39.322
Hey, Roger, I...

04:39.322 --> 04:41.846
Huh, I know he's usually
out doing stuff,

04:41.846 --> 04:43.674
but he's usually
also here.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.634
Steve-o,
what up, chode?

04:46.634 --> 04:47.765
I need your help.

04:47.765 --> 04:49.854
Can you get me... No can do, I'm busy.

04:49.854 --> 04:52.509
I finally figured out how to
get rid of all my Kohl's Cash

04:52.509 --> 04:55.164
Gift Cards without having
to buy anything from Kohl's.

04:55.164 --> 04:56.208
Later, chode!

04:56.208 --> 04:58.385
No, Rog...

05:01.039 --> 05:03.651
I know where
we can get IDs, Snot.

05:03.651 --> 05:06.306
But I'd be
breaking a promise
I made to my uncle.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.220
If my dad
taught me anything,

05:08.220 --> 05:12.877
breaking promises
is a huge part
of being a man.

05:12.877 --> 05:16.533
Gosh, your uncle really
has some unique outfits!

05:16.533 --> 05:18.230
Uh, it's nothing weird,

05:18.230 --> 05:19.710
he just likes to shop
at thrift stores

05:19.710 --> 05:21.059
and buy dead
people's clothes

05:21.059 --> 05:23.540
because sometimes
- they have wallets in them.
- Oh.

05:25.063 --> 05:26.413
Bingo.

05:26.413 --> 05:28.371
And these adult clothes
will make us look older

05:28.371 --> 05:30.025
than our
little boy clothes.

05:30.025 --> 05:33.028
We're going
to do this Steve,
I can feel it.

05:33.028 --> 05:37.598
A girl is gonna
rub your penis until
you orgasm tonight.

05:43.212 --> 05:45.562
What the hell do you think
you're doing?

05:47.695 --> 05:49.697
You don't have to
show ID, Clint!

05:49.697 --> 05:51.742
Anyone with Clint
is probably an asshole,

05:51.742 --> 05:53.570
but you can come in too!

05:54.310 --> 05:55.398
Hey, everybody!

05:55.398 --> 05:57.922
Look what the ol' ferret
dragged in!

05:58.923 --> 06:00.882
Clint!

06:00.882 --> 06:02.405
I thought you died!

06:02.405 --> 06:04.407
Steve,
what's happening?

06:04.407 --> 06:06.235
Roger's personas,

06:06.235 --> 06:07.932
they're working on us!

06:07.932 --> 06:11.588
Hey, everybody,
drinks are on us
if this credit card works!

06:13.373 --> 06:15.897
That's kind of a big "if"
though, right?

06:18.726 --> 06:22.251
Clint, I should kick your ass
for cheating me at pool

06:22.251 --> 06:25.080
and stealing my truck
last time.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.561
But now that I'm walking everywhere,

06:27.561 --> 06:29.301
my diabetes cleared up

06:29.301 --> 06:32.000
and I'm in the best shape
of my life!

06:32.740 --> 06:33.828
Carrot stick?

06:35.743 --> 06:39.137
I don't get why
the whole bar thinks
I'm this guy Clint.

06:39.137 --> 06:41.313
Listen, the good news is
for some reason

06:41.313 --> 06:43.054
they really believe
we're adults,

06:43.054 --> 06:45.753
which means buying this keg
is going to be super easy.

06:45.753 --> 06:47.407
Excuse me!

06:47.407 --> 06:49.887
I'd like to buy a keg of... No kegs today!

06:49.887 --> 06:52.324
Dave's the only one
with the key
to the keg fridge.

06:52.324 --> 06:53.413
- What?
- What?

06:53.413 --> 06:57.765
Our owner Dave
has the only key.

06:57.765 --> 06:59.549
And he's at
his friend's wedding.

06:59.549 --> 07:01.595
That's obviously
not the wedding
he's at now,

07:01.595 --> 07:03.814
but no doubt
it gets my point across.

07:03.814 --> 07:06.077
How many weddings
are on Friday night?

07:06.077 --> 07:07.601
There must be
a way to find it.

07:07.601 --> 07:09.080
I know where it is!

07:09.080 --> 07:10.647
I couldn't help
but overhear you

07:10.647 --> 07:12.823
because I've been
eavesdropping on people
a lot lately.

07:12.823 --> 07:16.131
Not only do I know
where the wedding is,
I'm going myself.

07:16.131 --> 07:19.613
See, me and my buddy,
we like to wedding crash.

07:19.613 --> 07:21.136
Like the movie.

07:21.136 --> 07:23.094
So when I heard Dave talking
about a wedding the other day,

07:23.094 --> 07:24.618
I locked it away.

07:24.618 --> 07:26.794
The Ramada on Fifth and...

07:26.794 --> 07:28.448
Something?

07:28.448 --> 07:30.798
Eh, if we drive down Fifth
long enough, we'll find it.

07:30.798 --> 07:33.148
Hit the ocean,
we've gone too far!

07:36.804 --> 07:38.283
There's a phone
in my jacket.

07:38.283 --> 07:40.242
Silent mode this bad boy.

07:44.638 --> 07:46.988
Steve, don't you think
it's a little weird

07:46.988 --> 07:49.033
that Lewis doesn't
recognize us?

07:49.033 --> 07:50.513
Yeah! I do.

07:50.513 --> 07:52.036
Now relax.

07:52.036 --> 07:58.521
<i>♪ Don't let the sun
go down on me</i>

07:58.521 --> 08:01.524
<i>♪ Although I search myself</i>

08:01.524 --> 08:05.702
<i>♪ It's always
someone else I see</i>

08:05.702 --> 08:10.751
<i>♪ I'd just allow a fragment
of your life</i>

08:11.665 --> 08:15.407
<i>♪ To wander free</i>

08:15.407 --> 08:17.888
<i>♪ Oh-ho!</i>

08:20.238 --> 08:22.414
Whoa, a new flavor!

08:22.414 --> 08:24.721
Green tea
with Moroccan mint!

08:24.721 --> 08:26.897
Should we buy it
instead of our usual

08:26.897 --> 08:28.856
green tea with peach
and lemongrass?

08:28.856 --> 08:30.510
Maybe we buy both?

08:30.510 --> 08:31.815
Buy both?

08:31.815 --> 08:34.165
Sure, why don't we buy
some fruit punch too?

08:34.165 --> 08:36.559
We're supposed to be
saving for a house

08:36.559 --> 08:38.692
to show your dad
we're responsible.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.911
And you want to double
our tea budget?

08:40.911 --> 08:43.174
And I said,
"Make it 10 bucks

08:43.174 --> 08:45.220
"and I'll put both
hands up there!"

08:45.220 --> 08:46.917
Ugh.

08:46.917 --> 08:48.310
Relax, Clint!

08:50.791 --> 08:52.575
This isn't even
my car!

08:52.575 --> 08:53.837
'Zooka Sharks!

08:53.837 --> 08:55.578
This is our year!

08:55.578 --> 08:58.189
Or maybe we get
all the flavors

08:58.189 --> 08:59.974
and don't use any
of our tea budget!

09:05.980 --> 09:07.285
Steve, look!

09:07.285 --> 09:08.939
The Ramada!

09:08.939 --> 09:10.985
Dave and his key
are right there!

09:15.642 --> 09:18.775
You check the perimeter,
I'll take the dance floor.

09:18.775 --> 09:21.212
Dave?

09:21.212 --> 09:22.779
Dave! Dave! Dave!
Dave! Dave!

09:22.779 --> 09:26.478
Dave! Dave! Dave!
Dave! Dave! Dave!

09:26.478 --> 09:28.872
Dave? Dave?

09:28.872 --> 09:33.921
Dave! Dave! Dave! Dave!

09:33.921 --> 09:34.965
Dave!

09:34.965 --> 09:36.488
Dr. Kenji!
You came!

09:36.488 --> 09:38.055
And I didn't even
invite you!

09:38.055 --> 09:40.492
You've got to
give a speech!

09:40.492 --> 09:42.146
Oh, no, no, no, no, no,
I couldn't...

09:42.146 --> 09:44.627
Guys, I want you
to meet my dentist.

09:44.627 --> 09:47.978
He's cool and he's always
telling me dirty jokes,

09:47.978 --> 09:49.501
and now he's going
to give a toast.

09:49.501 --> 09:52.983
This is gonna be better
than a Netflix
stand-up special!

09:55.812 --> 09:57.640
Oh, no.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.773
You can't go too blue.

09:59.773 --> 10:03.733
Uh, that's right,
I'm his dentist.

10:03.733 --> 10:05.430
And I swear

10:05.430 --> 10:08.825
that's "the whole tooth
and nothing but the tooth."

10:08.825 --> 10:10.348
Oh, no.

10:10.348 --> 10:11.480
Oh, no!

10:11.480 --> 10:13.177
Clint, you bastard!

10:13.177 --> 10:16.920
You just had to show up
on my wedding day!

10:16.920 --> 10:19.227
You know
I can't resist you.

10:21.490 --> 10:22.491
Come on!

10:23.710 --> 10:25.015
Someone in here, actually.

10:25.015 --> 10:26.364
It's okay.

10:26.364 --> 10:28.062
I know what you want.

10:31.848 --> 10:35.025
Whoa,
I do kind of want this!

10:35.025 --> 10:36.679
And that's when I said...

10:36.679 --> 10:40.552
"Make it 10 bucks and
I'll put both hands up there!"

10:42.685 --> 10:44.165
Thank you, goodnight!

10:46.210 --> 10:47.690
Dr. Kenji, everyone!

10:47.690 --> 10:50.301
That was so funny
I'm going to piss myself.

10:50.301 --> 10:51.694
I'm not lying!

10:51.694 --> 10:54.131
I know
you're loving this.

10:54.131 --> 11:01.051
I've been on my feet
all day long.

11:01.051 --> 11:03.575
What the hell
is going on in here?

11:03.575 --> 11:06.143
Hilarious speech, man.

11:06.143 --> 11:08.363
You don't meet a lot
of funny dentists.

11:08.363 --> 11:10.974
I'm actually looking
for a funny guy.

11:10.974 --> 11:13.411
See, I wasn't even invited
to this wedding.

11:13.411 --> 11:17.198
Me and my buddy
are wedding crashers,
like the movie.

11:17.198 --> 11:18.547
Except my buddy
didn't show up!

11:18.547 --> 11:20.549
So I'm done with him!
He's out!

11:20.549 --> 11:23.073
I'm looking
for a Vince Vaughn-type

11:23.073 --> 11:25.902
to play opposite
my Owen Wilson-type,

11:25.902 --> 11:28.731
and you might
fit the bill.

11:29.993 --> 11:31.603
You ruined my wedding!

11:31.603 --> 11:34.781
My wife's beautiful feet
smell like a face now!

11:37.609 --> 11:39.176
Come on!

11:39.176 --> 11:42.702
Oh, he is
a Vince Vaughn-type.

11:46.357 --> 11:48.751
Go, go!
This guy's gonna kill us!

11:48.751 --> 11:51.232
Okay, but this isn't
a normal cab,

11:51.232 --> 11:54.235
because this is
a Kohl's Cash Cab!

11:54.235 --> 11:56.106
It's just like the show
<i>Cash Cab</i>

11:56.106 --> 11:58.761
where they drive you around
and ask you trivia questions

11:58.761 --> 12:01.198
except on this one,
you win Kohl's Cash

12:01.198 --> 12:02.852
instead of usable cash!

12:02.852 --> 12:04.549
This is my pilot episode.

12:04.549 --> 12:06.769
I'm shooting it on my own
and hoping to sell it
to Kohl's.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.510
- Just go!
- Steve?

12:09.641 --> 12:11.469
Well, look who it is.

12:11.469 --> 12:13.645
Local piece of shit
Clint McGlint

12:13.645 --> 12:17.214
and dentist to
the Japanese mafia,
Dr. Kenji.

12:17.214 --> 12:19.608
Please, Rog... Uh-uh.

12:19.608 --> 12:23.090
Please...
Jamirquai J. Spunklestain.

12:23.090 --> 12:25.222
Ah, damn it!
Please just go!

12:25.222 --> 12:27.790
Okay, but only if you get
the questions right.

12:27.790 --> 12:30.662
Miss one question
and I drop you
at the next corner.

12:30.662 --> 12:32.795
This show is much harder
than the one that was on

12:32.795 --> 12:34.057
Discovery Channel!

12:34.057 --> 12:35.232
Here at <i>American Dad,</i>

12:35.232 --> 12:36.668
we love Discovery Channel

12:36.668 --> 12:38.148
and welcome
Warner Bros. Discovery

12:38.148 --> 12:40.107
as TBS's new overlord.

12:40.107 --> 12:43.023
Long may scripted television
reign supreme!

12:45.329 --> 12:46.983
What's the hardest haircut
to cut?

12:46.983 --> 12:49.507
- What?
- We've got company!

12:50.857 --> 12:51.988
That's your first question.

12:51.988 --> 12:54.338
What's the hardest haircut
to cut?

12:54.338 --> 12:56.471
Uh, the Rachel?

12:56.471 --> 12:57.951
Yes!
That's correct.

12:57.951 --> 13:00.780
And that's
a $50 Kohl's Cash!

13:02.346 --> 13:04.348
This question's
a little bit harder.

13:04.348 --> 13:06.698
What's the third-best
Pixar movie?

13:06.698 --> 13:08.352
Uh...
<i>The Incredibles!</i>

13:08.352 --> 13:10.180
Oops, sorry,
that's wrong!

13:11.225 --> 13:12.313
No, it's not!

13:12.313 --> 13:14.489
<i>Wall-E, Toy Story,
The Incredibles.</i>

13:14.489 --> 13:16.534
No, it goes <i>Shrek,
Toy Story,</i>

13:16.534 --> 13:18.145
<i>Nemo, Incredibles.</i>

13:18.145 --> 13:20.016
<i>Shrek's</i> not even
a Pixar movie!

13:20.016 --> 13:21.844
- Yes, it is!
- No, it isn't.

13:21.844 --> 13:22.976
It's Dreamworks.

13:22.976 --> 13:24.281
Please hold.

13:24.281 --> 13:26.370
Well, cluck me.
What do you know?

13:26.370 --> 13:28.851
That's $50
Kohl's Cash!

13:32.899 --> 13:34.030
He's back!

13:34.030 --> 13:36.119
Don't worry,
this next question's easy.

13:36.119 --> 13:39.166
What is the best
kind of weather?

13:40.080 --> 13:42.082
Rain!
- Wrong!

13:46.913 --> 13:50.046
Aw, I'm stuck real good.

13:50.046 --> 13:54.398
Sorry, but the best kind of
weather is two tornados.

13:54.398 --> 13:55.573
Thanks for playing.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.184
Wait, you're
dropping us off here?

13:57.184 --> 13:59.751
Damn, this is one
of the roughest parts
of Chimdale.

13:59.751 --> 14:02.232
But I don't pick
where you get
the answers wrong.

14:02.232 --> 14:03.712
Now get out!

14:05.192 --> 14:07.629
And quit going through
other people's stuff!

14:11.415 --> 14:13.504
Well,
Steve wants my help

14:13.504 --> 14:15.550
getting into
Vince Chung's party.

14:15.550 --> 14:18.379
Probably because of
our Taco Bell trauma bond.

14:23.950 --> 14:26.430
I just feel like
Steve and Snot

14:26.430 --> 14:28.780
might be in danger
for some reason.

14:30.782 --> 14:33.873
Geez, this Makahama guy
called a thousand times.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.179
Hey, the Uber
on this phone works.

14:36.179 --> 14:37.311
We can get home!

14:37.311 --> 14:39.791
Home?
But we have to
get the keg.

14:39.791 --> 14:42.359
How? Face it, Snot,
we're done.

14:42.359 --> 14:43.534
We lost Dave.

14:43.534 --> 14:45.406
And no Dave, no key.

14:45.406 --> 14:47.060
No key, no keg.

14:47.060 --> 14:48.583
No keg, no party.

14:48.583 --> 14:51.020
No party, no handie.

14:51.020 --> 14:54.023
Come on, Steve,
this is your destiny!

14:54.023 --> 14:55.895
Snot, it's okay.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.071
A part of me
is actually relieved.

14:58.071 --> 15:00.551
- What?
- It's just...

15:00.551 --> 15:03.250
I was a little afraid
of getting a handjob.

15:03.250 --> 15:05.295
Afraid? Why?

15:05.295 --> 15:07.297
What if I don't
do it right?

15:07.297 --> 15:08.951
What if
my penis is weird?

15:08.951 --> 15:11.258
I can't believe
this kind of talk.

15:11.258 --> 15:15.262
Steve, I have no doubt
you have a wonderful penis.

15:15.262 --> 15:17.960
Also, if you don't,
who cares?

15:17.960 --> 15:21.137
We're entering a new age
of body positivity

15:21.137 --> 15:23.835
where weird is beautiful,
my friend.

15:28.710 --> 15:29.841
Dave!

15:32.714 --> 15:34.585
- Dave!
- He's out.

15:34.585 --> 15:36.936
Well, we don't need him,
just the key.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.024
Check the keychain!

15:39.547 --> 15:42.985
He's only got
one key on here
like a psychopath.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.334
It must be inside.

15:48.469 --> 15:51.341
If we find the key
and hustle back to the bar
to get the keg,

15:51.341 --> 15:52.647
we can still
make the party.

15:52.647 --> 15:54.518
But the keg's not
at the bar.

15:54.518 --> 15:56.346
What?
How do you know that?

15:56.346 --> 15:58.392
Because it's right here.

16:04.876 --> 16:06.617
It's beautiful.

16:06.617 --> 16:07.967
You were right, Snot.

16:07.967 --> 16:11.013
It's our destiny.
Let's go!

16:11.013 --> 16:12.841
Let us
help you with that.

16:12.841 --> 16:16.671
You haven't been answering
your phone, Dr. Kenji.

16:23.591 --> 16:25.549
I'm sorry, Mr. Makahama,

16:25.549 --> 16:27.725
I assumed you wanted
sparkling water!

16:27.725 --> 16:31.033
Well, you know what happens
when you assume...

16:31.033 --> 16:32.426
You die!

16:35.864 --> 16:38.867
Dr. Kenji,
thank you for coming.

16:38.867 --> 16:42.740
I'm sorry we had to be
so persistent.

16:42.740 --> 16:45.743
Uh, no problem.

16:45.743 --> 16:48.007
Two nights ago,
I ate a gumdrop,

16:48.007 --> 16:50.922
and it made my tooth
really hurt.

16:50.922 --> 16:52.228
Then it went away.

16:52.228 --> 16:54.187
But then, I ate a bunch
of jujubes

16:54.187 --> 16:57.190
and the pain
came back worse!

16:58.452 --> 17:02.064
Please remove the tooth
at once.

17:02.064 --> 17:06.373
After you fix
the boss's tooth,
you'll get your keg back.

17:06.373 --> 17:08.070
How are we going
to get out of this?

17:08.070 --> 17:11.030
This is complex dental work,
and I'm terrible
with my hands.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.684
You said you wanted
to become a man, right?

17:13.684 --> 17:17.471
Well, a man's got to do
what a man's got to do.

17:21.910 --> 17:23.999
Okay,
what tooth is it?

17:28.264 --> 17:30.310
Just give that a second
to work.

17:33.661 --> 17:36.011
Now let's yank
this bad boy.

17:42.235 --> 17:45.977
It does not want
to come out!

17:48.371 --> 17:49.546
Hold on...

17:49.546 --> 17:51.113
Almost...

17:51.113 --> 17:52.419
Got it!

17:55.117 --> 17:56.553
'Ill 'hem!

17:56.553 --> 17:57.902
Steve, the cart!

17:57.902 --> 17:59.252
The elevator!

18:03.995 --> 18:04.996
Uh-oh.

18:09.262 --> 18:11.438
Oh, God!

18:14.876 --> 18:16.138
We're not falling!

18:16.138 --> 18:18.358
I think
we're flying this thing!

18:26.061 --> 18:28.324
We just passed
Vince Chung's house!

18:28.324 --> 18:30.109
We need to turn around!

18:31.284 --> 18:33.547
Deflect
off the Shark's Nest!

18:41.859 --> 18:43.209
We're alive!

18:44.210 --> 18:45.472
Oh, my God...

18:45.472 --> 18:47.604
It's Vince Chung's party!

18:47.604 --> 18:48.692
We did it!

18:48.692 --> 18:50.477
I'm gonna become a man!

18:50.477 --> 18:52.392
No, we didn't.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.873
- Who cares?
- Who cares?

18:55.873 --> 18:58.441
Uh, Vince Chung
for starters.

18:58.441 --> 19:00.182
We've come too far.

19:00.182 --> 19:01.966
I'm going to that party.

19:01.966 --> 19:03.925
And I'm getting
that handjob.

19:04.708 --> 19:07.668
Yass, queen!

19:07.668 --> 19:09.931
Yass!

19:14.414 --> 19:15.806
Hey...

19:15.806 --> 19:18.374
You have no clue
what I've been through tonight.

19:18.374 --> 19:20.594
Just to get here.
To you.

19:24.728 --> 19:27.775
Why the hell is this
old-ass guy
kissing me?

19:28.776 --> 19:30.517
That's my dentist!

19:30.517 --> 19:32.083
Oh, my God!

19:32.083 --> 19:33.781
Somebody kill them!

19:34.738 --> 19:35.783
Get 'em!

19:37.872 --> 19:39.613
We gotta get out
of these clothes!

19:42.050 --> 19:44.531
I can't believe how close
I came to becoming a man

19:44.531 --> 19:48.099
only to be, well,
too old I guess.

19:48.709 --> 19:50.014
What an awful night.

19:50.014 --> 19:51.190
Steve,

19:51.190 --> 19:54.193
tonight was the best night
of my life.

19:54.193 --> 19:55.324
And do you know why?

19:55.324 --> 19:57.021
'Cause that bride
grabbed your wiener?

19:57.021 --> 19:58.240
No...

19:58.240 --> 20:01.287
because I watched you
become a man.

20:02.375 --> 20:04.507
Yeah,
you didn't get an HJ,

20:04.507 --> 20:07.249
but you did give
an amazing wedding speech.

20:07.249 --> 20:09.860
You cracked a guy
over the head with a vase.

20:09.860 --> 20:13.037
You pulled the tongue
out of a Japanese mob boss.

20:13.037 --> 20:14.952
You shoved Vince Chung.

20:14.952 --> 20:17.172
And you kissed the girl.

20:20.784 --> 20:23.091
Hey, you haven't seen
some scuzzy guy

20:23.091 --> 20:25.224
and an off-duty dentist,
have you?

20:26.834 --> 20:28.270
Well, the Japanese mafia

20:28.270 --> 20:30.229
and a bunch
of high-school kids
want them dead,

20:30.229 --> 20:32.622
so you should probably
get off the streets.

20:32.622 --> 20:34.102
Can you give us
a ride home?

20:34.102 --> 20:36.844
No way!
Every man
for themselves!

20:38.193 --> 20:40.978
And put on some clothes!

20:40.978 --> 20:42.719
Somebody need a ride?

20:45.156 --> 20:46.593
Hey, I can't believe
they let you guys

20:46.593 --> 20:48.638
take your horses home
from horse camp.

20:48.638 --> 20:49.900
Oh, they didn't
let us...
