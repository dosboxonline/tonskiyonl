WEBVTT

00:12.416 --> 00:15.540
You know, we really
kind of hated each other in the beginning.

00:15.541 --> 00:16.625
But now...

00:18.625 --> 00:21.082
- But now?
- Huh?

00:21.083 --> 00:23.708
- Lilia, where do you go?
- [chuckles]

00:24.416 --> 00:26.999
[Lilia screams]

00:27.000 --> 00:28.124
Are you all right, ma'am?

00:28.125 --> 00:30.874
[Lilia] <i>When I was chased
out of every village I passed through</i>

00:30.875 --> 00:32.790
<i>for accurately predicting tragedy?</i>

00:32.791 --> 00:34.499
<i>"Tame your fears."</i>

00:34.500 --> 00:37.583
<i>That's what we're up against.
Our worst nightmares.</i>

00:40.250 --> 00:42.499
[speaking Sicilian]

00:42.500 --> 00:44.582
[in English] Are we looking
behind us, or ahead?

00:44.583 --> 00:46.083
Your lifeline is broken in two.

00:46.666 --> 00:48.707
- [Billy] What?
- The Tower reversed.

00:48.708 --> 00:50.041
[Billy] <i>That can't be good.</i>

00:52.291 --> 00:54.040
[gasps] Tommy!

00:54.041 --> 00:55.457
Wanda and Vision have kids?

00:55.458 --> 00:56.625
[Ralph] The little speedster

00:57.500 --> 00:58.957
and his mind-reading brother.

00:58.958 --> 01:01.208
[Eddie] <i>If you're not William Kaplan,</i>

01:01.958 --> 01:03.207
<i>who are you?</i>

01:03.208 --> 01:04.583
I'm Billy Maximoff.

01:05.750 --> 01:08.666
[screams] Help me!

01:11.125 --> 01:12.124
No!

01:12.125 --> 01:13.875
- [Lilia] What's happening? No!
- [both gasping]

01:14.791 --> 01:16.666
Death comes for us all.

01:36.416 --> 01:37.500
[Lilia gasps]

02:22.083 --> 02:24.958
You'll get a nosebleed
trying that hard to read my mind.

02:25.875 --> 02:27.208
- I'm not.
- Oh.

02:27.875 --> 02:28.875
Okay.

02:31.625 --> 02:34.665
You just can ask me your questions. Aloud.

02:34.666 --> 02:36.000
[Billy] Okay, then, where's Rio?

02:36.750 --> 02:37.750
Not that question.

02:38.250 --> 02:41.916
Any other queries for your old babysitter?

02:43.791 --> 02:46.375
It's the whole reason
you bought a ticket to ride, isn't it?

02:48.125 --> 02:52.083
I'm your mom's ex-best friend.

02:53.375 --> 02:55.208
I'll get what I want
at the end of The Road.

02:56.208 --> 02:58.125
And she's not my mom. I have a mom.

02:59.250 --> 03:01.083
Ooh!

03:10.583 --> 03:12.083
Is Wanda Maximoff really dead?

03:13.083 --> 03:14.083
Yes.

03:16.375 --> 03:18.250
No. Maybe.

03:20.250 --> 03:21.250
Did you see a body?

03:22.000 --> 03:23.041
Yes, I did.

03:23.541 --> 03:24.541
Did anybody else?

03:26.458 --> 03:27.458
It's hard to say.

03:28.958 --> 03:31.458
Hey, you want straight answers,
ask a straight lady.

03:35.083 --> 03:36.083
That's different.

03:42.291 --> 03:43.832
[sighs]

03:43.833 --> 03:45.625
The Road is a fickle mistress.

03:46.541 --> 03:48.166
More vague insight. Thank you.

03:51.208 --> 03:53.750
- In my experience, what I...
- In your experience?

03:54.583 --> 03:57.625
I honestly believed your experience
would be the key to our success here.

03:59.541 --> 04:00.666
We're alive.

04:01.750 --> 04:02.750
Success.

04:06.375 --> 04:08.583
Now I wonder
if you've ever been on The Road.

04:39.333 --> 04:40.333
Classic.

04:41.208 --> 04:43.833
Oh! She's based on me, you know.

04:44.833 --> 04:46.291
Prove it.

04:51.541 --> 04:54.416
Well, you seem pleased with your look.

04:55.416 --> 04:57.583
Well, if the cheekbones fit...

04:58.250 --> 04:59.250
Oh.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.750
Do you think this is important?

05:03.708 --> 05:05.791
"Your path winds out of time."

05:07.250 --> 05:09.125
It's Tarot. I know this, kind of.

05:14.958 --> 05:16.416
I'll read for you, I guess.

05:18.166 --> 05:19.416
No time like the present.

05:28.208 --> 05:29.207
The Horse Drawn Carri...

05:29.208 --> 05:31.124
- The Chariot?
- ...iot.

05:31.125 --> 05:33.166
It's literally written on the card.

05:33.750 --> 05:37.499
Right. So, obviously,
you're leaving somewhere behind,

05:37.500 --> 05:41.291
and you have these sphinxes with you,
and they represent your...

05:44.291 --> 05:46.999
Your... mysteriousness.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.624
You have a real gift.

05:48.625 --> 05:50.375
This card hasn't really come up much
for me.

05:50.791 --> 05:51.791
[objects clangs]

06:09.375 --> 06:10.916
I'll try another one.

06:14.833 --> 06:15.915
Seven of Swords.

06:15.916 --> 06:17.457
At least you're on theme.

06:17.458 --> 06:19.915
I know this one.
It's about deception and betrayal.

06:19.916 --> 06:21.458
Mmm. Check. Check.

06:23.250 --> 06:24.250
But it's reversed.

06:25.791 --> 06:27.541
So that means the opposite.

06:29.833 --> 06:31.125
You're being truthful?

06:32.000 --> 06:33.250
Well, that can't be right.

06:38.875 --> 06:40.249
My turn.

06:40.250 --> 06:42.458
Tarot is a con like any other.

06:42.958 --> 06:44.999
There's no magick to it. There's no skill.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.083
That's not true.

06:46.833 --> 06:49.499
It's about intuition.
Knowing which card to pull.

06:49.500 --> 06:51.957
And it's about interpretation,
divining their meaning.

06:51.958 --> 06:55.333
Eenie meanie miney mo!

06:56.458 --> 06:57.541
[grunts]

06:58.208 --> 06:59.290
[cackles]

06:59.291 --> 07:01.375
- Slow down! What is your problem?
- No!

07:10.416 --> 07:12.582
- Your turn is going great.
- This is a numbers game.

07:12.583 --> 07:15.124
We keep at it until we get
the right cards in the right spots

07:15.125 --> 07:16.624
or the ceiling runs out of swords.

07:16.625 --> 07:19.999
I'm not sure how much math you did
back in Salem, but that will take forever.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.666
We still have some time.

07:34.958 --> 07:36.083
I wish Lilia was here.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.958
[gasps] I was falling.

07:42.541 --> 07:43.541
Yeah, we both were.

07:46.250 --> 07:47.416
Where are we?

07:48.416 --> 07:52.749
You very clearly said we had to follow
this gross tunnel and look for shelving.

07:52.750 --> 07:53.833
Shelving?

07:55.250 --> 07:56.500
I don't know what that means.

07:57.083 --> 07:58.708
Neither do I, but I listened to you.

07:59.208 --> 08:01.082
Where's Agatha? Where's Rio?

08:01.083 --> 08:04.625
- You told me that they were...
- Teen kicked us off The Road.

08:05.541 --> 08:08.290
The son of the Scarlet Witch
kicked us off The Road.

08:08.291 --> 08:09.375
What?

08:10.208 --> 08:13.708
Teen is the son of the Scarlet Witch?
How do you know?

08:18.083 --> 08:19.291
I told you.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.000
Yeah.

08:28.000 --> 08:30.582
- I'm filthy.
- You're filthy.

08:30.583 --> 08:34.791
Yeah. Fittingly, we had a very grounding
heart-to-heart conversation.

08:35.791 --> 08:36.999
Us? Really?

08:37.000 --> 08:38.290
Okay, rude.

08:38.291 --> 08:40.208
Five-minutes-ago-Lilia
would never say that.

08:41.708 --> 08:46.082
You said this might happen,
but you're being extra wispy.

08:46.083 --> 08:47.333
Wispy?

08:48.208 --> 08:49.250
Kooky.

08:49.458 --> 08:52.250
Which is it? Am I wispy or am I kooky?

08:53.458 --> 08:56.415
A bit of both if I'm honest.

08:56.416 --> 08:58.957
Alice. Alice, don't.

08:58.958 --> 09:00.166
Try to save Agatha.

09:00.625 --> 09:03.332
Uh. Yes, I love this plan.

09:03.333 --> 09:06.500
I just think we should find
the ingredients first, though, right?

09:08.750 --> 09:11.333
Lilia, what do you see?

09:14.291 --> 09:17.166
[panting, speaking Sicilian]

09:18.000 --> 09:19.916
[speaking Sicilian]

09:20.416 --> 09:21.708
[in English] You are visiting, eh?

09:24.583 --> 09:25.791
How long has it been?

09:30.333 --> 09:31.582
Centuries.

09:31.583 --> 09:33.625
A long time. For you.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.250
We're having a lesson?

09:39.958 --> 09:40.958
Your first.

09:41.458 --> 09:43.625
Mmm. Tea leaves.

09:44.625 --> 09:45.916
I was bad at tea leaves.

09:46.416 --> 09:47.666
[Maestra speaking Sicilian]

09:48.375 --> 09:51.999
[in English] This is a fiction
you told yourself and tell yourself still.

09:52.000 --> 09:53.416
Because it's true.

09:55.166 --> 09:56.833
Ah, the easy road.

09:59.041 --> 10:01.083
What do you see, Lilia?

10:20.250 --> 10:21.333
[gasps]

10:23.541 --> 10:24.999
You're confused again. It's okay.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.083
I'm not...

10:27.083 --> 10:28.082
confused.

10:28.083 --> 10:29.166
Okay.

10:34.208 --> 10:37.083
Don't worry. I haven't heard them
since the subway station.

10:39.375 --> 10:41.583
- I'm talking about the Salem Seven.
- I know that.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.416
You think I'm batty, is that it?

10:45.500 --> 10:48.333
You look at me and you see
some doddering old broad.

10:48.916 --> 10:50.458
Tell me what more should I see.

10:51.916 --> 10:53.541
No, no, no. I mean it.

10:54.833 --> 10:55.833
Tell me.

10:56.750 --> 10:59.833
You mentioned something about gaps?

11:05.958 --> 11:09.625
The flow of time is an illusion, Jen.
Most people don't realize that.

11:13.166 --> 11:17.416
When I was a child,
I experienced my life out of sequence.

11:19.083 --> 11:21.666
I would get these flashes. These gaps...

11:24.416 --> 11:27.291
Now it's happening again,
and it's... [gasps]

11:29.500 --> 11:30.666
It's getting worse.

11:33.750 --> 11:34.750
That sounds terrifying.

11:36.500 --> 11:37.541
Why is it getting worse?

11:41.250 --> 11:43.041
Maybe because I'm close to the end.

11:44.125 --> 11:45.208
Of The Road?

11:46.041 --> 11:47.541
Like, your full power is returning?

11:49.458 --> 11:51.374
I'm not so sure I want it...

11:51.375 --> 11:52.458
[screams] Back!

11:53.958 --> 11:55.832
Agatha? What are you doing?

11:55.833 --> 11:58.499
Did you not see imminent impalement
in your future?

11:58.500 --> 12:00.707
- [groans]
- [Agatha gasps]

12:00.708 --> 12:04.583
- Lilia! Well, I'm trying to help you!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

12:05.625 --> 12:06.916
Are you okay?

12:08.291 --> 12:10.665
Whoa! Ow!
I thought we were cool!

12:10.666 --> 12:12.790
We are not cool, Teenager.

12:12.791 --> 12:14.749
Damn, using his full name.

12:14.750 --> 12:16.040
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

12:16.041 --> 12:18.375
I shouldn't have lashed out at you.
You didn't deserve...

12:21.041 --> 12:22.625
I wasn't hiding my power from you.

12:23.958 --> 12:25.375
I didn't know that I could...

12:26.166 --> 12:29.207
I'm not lying to you.
It was a surprise to me, too.

12:29.208 --> 12:30.666
If I'd have known, I would've...

12:33.750 --> 12:34.750
Yes,

12:35.666 --> 12:36.832
of course,

12:36.833 --> 12:38.541
I would have used it to save Alice.

12:39.750 --> 12:40.916
You're reading my mind.

12:41.791 --> 12:44.916
Only because it's so loud. No offense.

12:45.375 --> 12:46.500
I remember you now.

12:48.291 --> 12:49.291
Your bar mitzvah.

12:52.958 --> 12:54.041
Lilia, take it easy.

12:55.333 --> 12:57.124
Jen, aren't you furious?

12:57.125 --> 12:59.207
I mean, always.
But collectively, we've moved on.

12:59.208 --> 13:02.165
At your prompting, Dory.

13:02.166 --> 13:04.125
Back off, Agatha. She's having a day.

13:04.625 --> 13:06.416
The flow of time is an illusion, right?

13:07.458 --> 13:10.750
So trust me when I say
you're not mad at the kid anymore.

13:16.458 --> 13:17.458
What are you wearing?

13:18.541 --> 13:20.666
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- What am I wearing?

13:21.166 --> 13:22.499
- This is so demeaning.
- [Jen] Hey.

13:22.500 --> 13:25.000
Focus up, Calderu.
We can be culturally offended later.

13:30.291 --> 13:33.916
I was doing a reading for you.

13:35.166 --> 13:36.166
That's right.

13:36.750 --> 13:37.833
What went wrong?

13:38.583 --> 13:41.041
I don't know. You seemed pretty on point.

13:46.166 --> 13:47.541
I'm glad you're here now.

13:48.791 --> 13:50.500
Because now you need me.

13:50.958 --> 13:53.041
[grunts and sighs]

13:53.250 --> 13:54.541
Ain't that just like a witch?

13:56.125 --> 13:58.958
Lilia, are you the one
who cast the sigil on me?

14:00.958 --> 14:02.958
I saw what was going to happen
to you that night.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.666
I saw who you were
and who you would become.

14:08.416 --> 14:09.541
I knew you'd need time.

14:11.875 --> 14:14.082
[all screaming]

14:14.083 --> 14:16.249
We didn't even put any cards down!

14:16.250 --> 14:18.500
Maybe no cards is as bad
as the wrong ones.

14:23.416 --> 14:24.541
What did I do wrong?

14:25.750 --> 14:28.290
- Make it stop!
- I would if I could!

14:28.291 --> 14:30.999
I hated this the first time!

14:31.000 --> 14:32.707
Lilia's being weird again.

14:32.708 --> 14:33.958
[screaming]

14:39.125 --> 14:40.874
Looks like we came to the right place.

14:40.875 --> 14:42.041
Are you all right, ma'am?

14:42.625 --> 14:45.415
Stop. Stop, stop, stop.

14:45.416 --> 14:47.583
Stop, stop, stop.

14:52.791 --> 14:54.250
Tell me about your life now.

14:55.541 --> 14:57.750
- What?
- Are you rooted in nature?

14:58.916 --> 15:00.041
Not especially, no.

15:00.750 --> 15:02.582
Are you nimble with your craft?

15:02.583 --> 15:04.290
[scoffs] If I was, I wouldn't be here.

15:04.291 --> 15:05.832
Have you a coven?

15:05.833 --> 15:07.250
[chuckles wryly]

15:08.333 --> 15:09.625
[in Sicilian]

15:10.583 --> 15:12.208
[in English] A witch requires a coven.

15:12.916 --> 15:13.999
What for?

15:14.000 --> 15:17.041
It didn't work out for me the first time.
It's sure not going well now.

15:18.291 --> 15:21.833
It's better to be a hermit. To be a fraud.

15:23.041 --> 15:25.375
So much fear. Even now.

15:28.041 --> 15:30.166
Please just tell me
how to control what's happening.

15:30.541 --> 15:33.666
Your task is not to control, but to see.

15:39.791 --> 15:41.207
- [Lilia gasps]
- What?

15:41.208 --> 15:43.832
I was hoping
I would get to skip this part entirely.

15:43.833 --> 15:46.499
Well, you did miss out
on the champagne brunch back there.

15:46.500 --> 15:47.625
- Really?
- No.

15:49.125 --> 15:51.749
You get any new intel
on your mental walkabout?

15:51.750 --> 15:54.291
- I know what the next trial is.
- It's Tarot.

15:55.125 --> 15:57.791
- Why didn't you say that?
- Because you're the one who told me.

16:19.833 --> 16:22.166
[Jen] You said this used to happen to you
when you were younger.

16:26.500 --> 16:27.833
Why'd it stop?

16:30.041 --> 16:31.041
Because I wanted it to.

16:32.458 --> 16:33.458
I ignored it.

16:34.375 --> 16:36.000
I put it away.

16:37.916 --> 16:39.041
Why?

16:40.958 --> 16:42.416
Because all I saw was death.

16:44.708 --> 16:47.207
- [Billy] <i>Your turn is going great.</i>
- [Agatha] <i>This is a numbers game.</i>

16:47.208 --> 16:48.415
<i>- We keep at it...</i>
- Oh, my God.

16:48.416 --> 16:51.082
<i>...cards in the right spots
or the ceiling runs out of swords.</i>

16:51.083 --> 16:52.166
[gasps] Is that...

16:52.958 --> 16:54.166
Shelving.

16:55.125 --> 16:56.583
We still have some time.

17:03.791 --> 17:05.041
I wish Lilia was here.

17:06.375 --> 17:07.500
[Lilia groans]

17:09.708 --> 17:10.750
[Billy] You're alive.

17:16.666 --> 17:17.666
[Agatha] What...

17:20.875 --> 17:23.208
Relax, baby. We're cool.

17:23.791 --> 17:25.583
- We are?
- Hey, things are lookin' up.

17:26.166 --> 17:27.166
Oh, my God!

17:30.625 --> 17:31.666
My task is to see.

17:33.583 --> 17:35.040
Who massacred this spread?

17:35.041 --> 17:36.125
- He did!
- She did!

17:38.166 --> 17:39.291
Who's the querent?

17:40.416 --> 17:43.290
You mean the subject? Me.
I guess I'm the queer-ent.

17:43.291 --> 17:44.500
[chuckles politely]

17:46.583 --> 17:49.374
[grunts] The querent shuffles and cuts.

17:49.375 --> 17:51.833
- Lilia, we don't have time for this.
- Shuffles and cuts.

17:52.875 --> 17:54.124
Now, please ask your question.

17:54.125 --> 17:56.332
- How are we gonna get out of here?
- Teen must ask.

17:56.333 --> 17:57.832
Ask her how we're getting out...

17:57.833 --> 17:59.832
It must be vital to his journey on Earth.

17:59.833 --> 18:02.499
- I'd say it's pretty vital.
- Lilia, can you just deal?

18:02.500 --> 18:04.624
- He must ask a question!
- What does it matter?

18:04.625 --> 18:07.457
- Tarot takes time and care!
- And leads to large, gaping wounds.

18:07.458 --> 18:09.000
Am I William or am I Billy?

18:15.625 --> 18:16.957
That's a very good question.

18:16.958 --> 18:19.541
See? Lilia knows what she's doing.

18:22.791 --> 18:27.875
This is the "Safe Passage" spread.
The first card is you, the Traveler.

18:28.666 --> 18:31.875
Next comes What's Missing,
the reason for your quest.

18:32.375 --> 18:35.957
Here is the Path Behind,
wounds suffered, lessons learned.

18:35.958 --> 18:39.375
Here is the Path Ahead,
a space for growth and discovery.

18:40.083 --> 18:43.790
Of course, you will face Obstacles
preceding a potential Windfall.

18:43.791 --> 18:47.208
You must overcome all
to reach your destination.

18:50.375 --> 18:51.457
What, no snide remarks?

18:51.458 --> 18:53.374
- Made sense to me.
- That sounded good to me.

18:53.375 --> 18:56.375
Good. Now, Teen, I want you
to hold your question in your mind.

18:57.208 --> 18:59.958
Push everything else away.
Focus on that question.

19:02.416 --> 19:03.583
Pick a card.

19:07.500 --> 19:08.708
You are the Magician.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.500
You have enormous potential

19:12.083 --> 19:14.583
and the ability to turn
all of your goals into reality.

19:16.375 --> 19:17.790
Very fitting.

19:17.791 --> 19:18.958
[all gasp]

19:22.583 --> 19:24.332
I don't mean to question your methods...

19:24.333 --> 19:25.749
Then don't.

19:25.750 --> 19:27.791
Choose your next card. What's Missing?

19:30.416 --> 19:34.333
The Sun. Good fortune, joy, reunion.

19:34.916 --> 19:37.374
- "Reunion."
- [gasps]

19:37.375 --> 19:39.874
[scoffs] How are we supposed
to get it right

19:39.875 --> 19:42.165
when Tarot is completely subjective?

19:42.166 --> 19:44.375
Pick again. The Path Behind.

19:47.500 --> 19:48.999
- [gasps]
- No, no, no!

19:49.000 --> 19:50.208
Get off me!

19:53.791 --> 19:56.124
You know, we really hated each other
from the beginning.

19:56.125 --> 19:57.375
But now...

19:58.666 --> 20:00.000
I love you, guys.

20:01.750 --> 20:04.082
- What am I missing?
- [Maestra speaks Italian]

20:04.083 --> 20:07.207
[in English] What are you missing?
Why are you on this journey?

20:07.208 --> 20:08.582
I didn't wanna come.

20:08.583 --> 20:09.958
Then why did you?

20:11.791 --> 20:13.000
To get my power back.

20:13.500 --> 20:17.958
Is it gone? Where did it go?
This is not the true reason.

20:19.208 --> 20:20.624
I'm a forgotten woman.

20:20.625 --> 20:22.999
Then remember yourself.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.291
What's worth remembering? That you died?

20:26.708 --> 20:27.874
That I saw it coming?

20:27.875 --> 20:31.165
Our entire coven wiped out by a fever.
I saw it.

20:31.166 --> 20:33.666
I told you. But it didn't change anything.

20:35.416 --> 20:36.708
Death comes for us all.

20:38.708 --> 20:40.166
You say it like it's a comfort.

20:41.583 --> 20:43.250
It is what we all have in common.

20:47.416 --> 20:49.583
When will it come for me?

20:55.541 --> 20:56.541
I was falling.

21:00.541 --> 21:01.708
I will fall.

21:02.833 --> 21:06.666
Yes. What will you do
with your remaining time?

21:08.500 --> 21:09.583
Jen, wake up.

21:12.916 --> 21:14.999
- What happened?
- The son of the Scarlet Witch

21:15.000 --> 21:17.040
telepathically kicked us off The Road.

21:17.041 --> 21:19.125
We sank beneath the surface,
and now we're here.

21:21.041 --> 21:22.416
I have a lot of questions.

21:25.458 --> 21:27.041
Agatha is in the trial with Billy.

21:27.625 --> 21:29.749
- Who is Billy?
- The son of the Scarlet Witch.

21:29.750 --> 21:32.832
Try to keep up.
It's a Divination trial. Tarot.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.624
We've got to find the bookshelf.

21:34.625 --> 21:36.999
I can see all the pieces
falling into place.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.499
The gaps are filling in.

21:38.500 --> 21:39.957
I'm telling you now because soon

21:39.958 --> 21:42.250
- I'm not going to remember any of this.
- Okay.

21:42.750 --> 21:43.749
Which way do we go?

21:43.750 --> 21:46.166
Well, look at the options.

21:50.833 --> 21:53.500
Is that the way out?
Off the Witches' Road?

21:58.791 --> 22:01.249
[Salem Seven witches whispering]
Find her! Agatha Harkness!

22:01.250 --> 22:02.833
- [Jen] The Seven.
- [Lilia] Hide!

22:10.750 --> 22:13.791
[whispering menacingly]
Find her! Agatha Harkness!

22:21.625 --> 22:22.749
Where are they going?

22:22.750 --> 22:24.416
No need to worry about them right now.

22:25.000 --> 22:28.416
Jen, I'm going to take this path
toward my trial.

22:29.416 --> 22:30.750
Agatha and Billy need my help.

22:33.833 --> 22:34.958
I hope you'll join me.

22:36.208 --> 22:37.208
Why?

22:38.166 --> 22:40.333
Because you are my sister in the craft.

23:03.666 --> 23:05.166
I know what I did wrong.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.833
"My path winds out of time."

23:09.791 --> 23:13.833
I was reading for the wrong person.
I am the Traveler.

23:17.958 --> 23:19.333
I am...

23:19.916 --> 23:20.916
the Queen of Cups.

23:22.500 --> 23:23.958
Now you see.

23:26.500 --> 23:28.583
Empathetic, intuitive,

23:30.458 --> 23:31.583
inner voice to be trusted.

23:32.166 --> 23:35.166
Yes, you're a mensch, Lilia,
but let's say we place a card.

23:39.125 --> 23:40.500
No sword.

23:41.333 --> 23:43.625
If she got the card right,
why doesn't the ceiling stop?

23:44.208 --> 23:45.208
What's Missing.

23:49.333 --> 23:50.333
Three of Pentacles.

23:54.166 --> 23:58.416
Collaboration, community,
singular voices waiting to harmonize.

23:59.166 --> 24:02.083
I needed you. My coven.

24:04.875 --> 24:05.916
[gasps]

24:07.041 --> 24:08.125
The Path Behind...

24:08.625 --> 24:10.375
The Knight of Wands.

24:13.833 --> 24:15.958
Full of fire. Fights bravely.

24:21.708 --> 24:23.083
[Billy] We're running out of time.

24:23.916 --> 24:25.250
The Path Ahead...

24:26.166 --> 24:27.166
High Priestess.

24:29.875 --> 24:33.000
Immense spiritual power,
unable or unwilling to use it.

24:37.333 --> 24:38.333
Obstacles...

24:39.041 --> 24:40.041
Three of Swords.

24:42.750 --> 24:45.416
Heartbreak, sorrow, grief.

24:47.916 --> 24:48.916
The Windfall...

24:54.041 --> 24:55.458
Tower reversed.

24:56.583 --> 25:00.250
Disaster, destruction,
sudden upheaval, but reversed,

25:00.833 --> 25:02.750
it means miraculous transformation.

25:04.958 --> 25:07.041
And finally, the Destination...

25:12.583 --> 25:14.500
[gasps and moans]

25:35.291 --> 25:36.499
[women screaming]

25:36.500 --> 25:37.916
[Jen] Agatha, what did you do?

25:38.916 --> 25:40.332
You get your power

25:40.333 --> 25:42.332
<i>and I get my bodies.</i>

25:42.333 --> 25:44.208
Who is here with us tonight?

25:45.333 --> 25:47.374
D, E,

25:47.375 --> 25:49.291
- A, T...
- A, T...

25:50.291 --> 25:51.708
H. Death.

25:52.166 --> 25:53.374
[cackles]

25:53.375 --> 25:56.458
In the end, all roads lead to me.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.583
Rio is...

26:05.625 --> 26:06.958
[Agatha] Lilia!

26:08.708 --> 26:09.833
[whirring stops]

26:37.750 --> 26:41.416
Lilia, you did it. You saved us.

26:44.500 --> 26:46.000
What happened?

26:46.583 --> 26:47.583
Rio...

26:48.500 --> 26:49.500
She's Death.

26:50.500 --> 26:52.041
She's what?

26:52.541 --> 26:53.958
The original Green Witch.

26:57.708 --> 26:59.000
Is it true?

27:01.000 --> 27:03.791
What can I say? I like the bad boys.

27:05.375 --> 27:07.957
[menacing whispering approaching]

27:07.958 --> 27:09.165
The Seven. They're here.

27:09.166 --> 27:11.250
Quick. Everyone in the iron maiden.

27:15.541 --> 27:17.415
When she calls you a coward, hit the deck.

27:17.416 --> 27:18.833
- What?
- Go.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.458
- How...
- Magick.

27:25.541 --> 27:26.833
Thank you.

27:27.833 --> 27:28.874
I'm not going before you.

27:28.875 --> 27:30.416
You're the Path Ahead, Jennifer.

27:32.875 --> 27:35.499
- Lilia.
- I loved being a witch.

27:35.500 --> 27:36.625
No!

27:49.791 --> 27:51.541
You may not know this about The Road,

27:53.458 --> 27:56.125
but when you successfully
complete a trial,

27:59.791 --> 28:01.125
like I just did,

28:05.541 --> 28:06.916
it's not a good idea

28:09.833 --> 28:11.041
to overstay your welcome.

28:13.833 --> 28:16.833
Usually something terrible happens.

28:19.458 --> 28:20.458
Disaster,

28:21.541 --> 28:22.541

28:24.083 --> 28:25.083
