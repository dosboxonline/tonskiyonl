00:41.458 --> 00:44.500
Far away, tucked behind
the hills of North India

00:44.583 --> 00:47.166
lies our little town, Riverdale.

00:47.250 --> 00:49.166
It was founded in 1914

00:49.250 --> 00:50.833
by Sir John Riverdale,

00:50.916 --> 00:53.625
a British officer
whose first posting was at Bombay.

00:54.958 --> 00:58.666
His head was occupied by his work,
but his heart was captivated

00:58.750 --> 01:00.625
by the land and all of its bounties.

01:00.916 --> 01:04.416
The sunshine, the Arabian Sea,
the jasmine flowers, the delicacies,

01:04.500 --> 01:07.375
and a beautiful local girl named Sitara.

01:08.750 --> 01:12.250
A wedding and four children later,
adventure called yet again.

01:12.500 --> 01:15.083
Sir John went hunting
with the Prince of Sarna…

01:17.333 --> 01:20.000
and stumbled upon paradise.

01:20.541 --> 01:23.958
He had found a place to call home
and to bear his name.

01:24.541 --> 01:27.208
Sir John and his family
gathered up all their savings,

01:27.291 --> 01:28.625
everything they owned

01:28.708 --> 01:31.458
and leased the land
from the Prince of Sarno's father,

01:31.541 --> 01:32.625
the Maharajah.

01:32.708 --> 01:35.208
And a new city was built for the people

01:35.291 --> 01:37.333
who, like Sir John's family,

01:37.416 --> 01:39.625
were half British and half Indian.

01:40.458 --> 01:42.375
The Anglo-Indian community.

01:43.375 --> 01:45.583
Over time, India gained independence.

01:45.666 --> 01:49.083
Some of the Anglo Indians left,
and some stayed.

01:49.791 --> 01:51.916
Those who remained in Riverdale,

01:52.000 --> 01:54.875
found their solace
in the heart of the town.

01:55.875 --> 01:59.000
A grassy knoll called Green Park,

01:59.791 --> 02:02.375
where every citizen
planted a tree of their own.

02:02.875 --> 02:05.125
In other words,
this is where the community

02:05.208 --> 02:08.125
literally planted their roots.

02:16.291 --> 02:19.125
-So beautiful.
-This is Green Park.

02:19.416 --> 02:22.541
This is not just the heart,
but the history of Riverdale.

02:22.791 --> 02:25.291
We have a tradition here
known as planting day.

02:25.375 --> 02:27.291
When children from Riverdale
turn five,

02:27.375 --> 02:29.958
their parents bring them all here
to plant a tree.

02:31.166 --> 02:32.625
My tree is over there.

02:32.708 --> 02:33.833
How lovely.

02:34.583 --> 02:36.791
I wish every town had a park like this.

02:36.875 --> 02:39.041
Some things
are worth fighting for.

02:39.125 --> 02:40.875
-Is that so?
-Yes.

02:40.958 --> 02:42.541
Are there any musicians here?

02:42.625 --> 02:44.833
Oh, yeah.
I just learned to play the sitar.

02:44.916 --> 02:47.291
This beautiful pergola
was a bandstand.

02:47.375 --> 02:50.333
Music would be played there
and people would dance here.

02:50.625 --> 02:54.708
This tradition lives on today.
1914-1964.

02:55.250 --> 02:57.666
Can you guess
who was the last to perform here?

02:57.750 --> 02:59.958
-Uh, Elvis Presley?
-No.

03:00.041 --> 03:00.958
Uh, Ray Charles?

03:01.041 --> 03:02.166
-No.
-Then who?

03:03.083 --> 03:04.875
-The Archies.
-Who are the Archies?

03:05.333 --> 03:08.250
I'm sorry,
but I have never heard of the Archies.

03:08.333 --> 03:10.791
Yeah, but had you heard
of the Beatles a few years ago?

03:10.875 --> 03:12.583
No.

03:12.666 --> 03:14.625
Mark my words,
the Archies will be everywhere.

03:15.083 --> 03:18.416
At which point you can proudly say
that you met the lead singer.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.250
-Me.
-You're a singer?

03:20.333 --> 03:21.750
Yes, I am.

03:22.333 --> 03:23.916
This special tour was designed for you

03:24.000 --> 03:26.208
by Fred Andrews
of Andrews Tours and Travel.

03:26.291 --> 03:28.083
-Thank you.
-Please enjoy Green Park.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.250
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

03:29.333 --> 03:30.333
Thank you.

03:39.500 --> 03:40.916
Stop it, Betty.

03:44.125 --> 03:45.958
And would you tell
that jukebox to shut up?

03:46.041 --> 03:47.250
No! I love it.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.791
Aw, they're all here to welcome us.

04:49.875 --> 04:52.791
Of course! You have to sing
for your supper.

04:53.375 --> 04:55.625
-Smithers.
-Miss Lodge.

04:55.708 --> 04:58.250
-Are we all set for the party?
-Absolutely.

04:58.541 --> 04:59.458
Thank you.

06:39.583 --> 06:40.625
-Thank you.
-See you.

07:17.833 --> 07:20.500
You've come back
at the right time, Mr. Lodge.

07:20.916 --> 07:23.458
Riverdale truly needs you.

07:23.541 --> 07:26.208
And the Council has passed
your proposal as well.

07:26.666 --> 07:27.916
I told you it would work.

07:28.000 --> 07:31.041
-That you did.
-They have no objection at all

07:31.125 --> 07:32.916
to the plaza being built in the square.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.000
Excellent.

07:34.500 --> 07:37.208
Sir. These shops are private properties.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.833
Although if they're willing to sell,
then it's fine.

07:41.750 --> 07:43.625
Everything is for sale, Dawson.

07:44.541 --> 07:45.833
Let's get to the point.

07:46.333 --> 07:49.208
Have you moved on what we discussed?

07:49.291 --> 07:52.333
The Council will give us permission
to construct a hotel?

07:52.416 --> 07:53.333
Why wouldn't they?

07:53.416 --> 07:54.458
Of course, they're gonna.

07:54.541 --> 07:56.583
They just have to decide on the area.

07:57.625 --> 07:58.625
My thought is…

08:00.500 --> 08:03.500
that this will be the best spot.

08:03.583 --> 08:04.625
-No?
-Hmm.

08:04.708 --> 08:07.333
Well done, old chap.
That could work nicely.

08:07.916 --> 08:08.875
Mr. Dawson.

08:11.250 --> 08:13.208
You don't want
to come to a new place

08:13.291 --> 08:16.000
and land up in the outskirts now, do you?

08:17.541 --> 08:19.583
You want to be where the life is.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.375
The food, the shops…

08:25.000 --> 08:26.041
Hmm.

08:27.125 --> 08:28.833
This would be better, wouldn't it?

08:32.000 --> 08:33.625
But that's Green Park.

08:33.708 --> 08:36.625
That's your spot, right in the heart.

08:36.708 --> 08:39.916
Hotel Riverdale can't be far
from the town center, Hiram.

08:40.000 --> 08:44.250
All my best business ideas,
My American gives me.

08:47.333 --> 08:50.375
Green Park will definitely be
a controversial choice.

08:50.458 --> 08:54.250
That's why, needless to say,
my name can't come up at all.

08:55.041 --> 08:57.250
Once the Council permissions go through,

08:57.833 --> 09:00.125
you can get a few companies
to submit offers.

09:00.208 --> 09:05.125
-But naturally, you will select…
-Lodge Industries.

09:05.708 --> 09:07.166
Good man.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.041
Getting permission requires five votes.

09:13.041 --> 09:14.708
But I will try my best, Mr. Lodge.

09:15.291 --> 09:16.666
-Try?
-Yes.

09:16.750 --> 09:18.750
Trying will get you nowhere, Dawson.

09:18.833 --> 09:20.291
Now go get the votes.

09:24.208 --> 09:27.916
If I were the District Corporator,
you know, I'd get it done easily.

09:30.750 --> 09:34.208
So, what's stopping you
from standing for election?

09:35.833 --> 09:38.583
Elections are… They're quite costly.

09:38.666 --> 09:41.291
You understand me, right, Mr. Lodge?

09:42.583 --> 09:44.541
Well done, Dawson.

09:45.125 --> 09:47.041
You understand politics.

09:47.958 --> 09:49.416
I'm impressed.

09:50.125 --> 09:52.458
Now help me help you.

09:52.541 --> 09:55.708
I want Green Park for the hotel. Hmm?

09:56.250 --> 09:59.083
But first a plaza in the town square.

10:11.541 --> 10:12.708
Mango milkshake.

10:12.791 --> 10:14.916
Who's the best doggie in the world?

10:15.000 --> 10:16.208
Hamburger.

10:16.291 --> 10:18.750
Hot Dog, do you find Moosey handsome?

10:19.458 --> 10:20.625
Hot Dog can't talk.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.208
Is that so, Hot Dog?

10:25.291 --> 10:28.000
Put that burger down, Jones!

10:29.125 --> 10:30.750
My tips should handle it, Pops.

10:30.833 --> 10:33.875
Your tips aren't enough to cover it, kid.
What about the rest?

10:33.958 --> 10:36.333
It's okay. I don't mind sharing.

10:36.416 --> 10:37.500
Huh.

10:37.833 --> 10:39.458
You should mind, Ethel.

10:39.541 --> 10:43.250
He just cares about eating.
He's oblivious to your feelings.

10:43.333 --> 10:44.916
"Oblivious"?

10:45.000 --> 10:46.416
What is "oblivious"?

10:48.041 --> 10:50.250
You don't know
what "oblivious" means, Moose?

10:50.333 --> 10:51.208
No.

10:52.083 --> 10:55.875
I calculate you've already lived
about 25% of your life?

10:55.958 --> 10:58.291
Tell me, what have you learned so far?

10:59.750 --> 11:00.625
Nothing.

11:01.291 --> 11:03.666
-Moose!
-What's so funny?

11:18.916 --> 11:20.208
Aunty Hermione!

11:20.291 --> 11:21.708
Look who's here!

11:21.791 --> 11:24.416
Betty! Baby, how lovely to see you.

11:25.666 --> 11:27.708
-Aw.
-These are for you.

11:27.791 --> 11:29.750
-Will you put these in my bedroom, please?
-Sure.

11:29.833 --> 11:31.625
-You all set for the party tonight?
-Mm-hmm.

11:32.291 --> 11:34.125
Still haven't worked out
your evening wear?

11:34.208 --> 11:35.125
Oh.

11:42.208 --> 11:43.375
"Darlings."

11:45.375 --> 11:49.083
I can't believe you can stick
eyelashes on. This is so mod.

11:49.166 --> 11:52.208
You keep it. My dad can always
get some more for me, later.

11:52.291 --> 11:54.458
No, two gifts are plenty, Ronnie.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.458
What happened to
"What's mine is yours," Betts?

11:59.458 --> 12:01.958
We still share everything, I hope?

12:02.041 --> 12:03.291
For always and ever.

12:04.833 --> 12:07.000
Okay. Now, what do you think?

12:10.250 --> 12:11.916
This dress? Or this one?

12:12.000 --> 12:14.791
So, that's really cute,
and that's really short.

12:14.875 --> 12:17.083
It's called a mini.
It's all the rage in London.

12:17.166 --> 12:20.166
But remember, you're not in London,
you're in Riverdale.

12:20.250 --> 12:22.916
Or Riverdale should
remember something , too.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.333
That Veronica is back.

12:25.166 --> 12:26.625
I've missed you.

12:26.708 --> 12:29.958
So, tell me, Archie, how is he?

12:30.416 --> 12:31.833
After I left town…

12:32.791 --> 12:33.875
has he seen anyone else?

12:34.583 --> 12:37.208
He's dated everyone, but no one.

12:38.250 --> 12:39.583
I thought you didn't care.

12:40.041 --> 12:42.375
I… I don't. I was just asking
about the latest.

12:43.291 --> 12:46.750
The latest is that
most of us work part-time jobs now.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.375
Jobs? I look cute?

12:50.000 --> 12:50.958
You're so cute.

12:54.250 --> 12:57.000
But I'm not in the mood for cute.

12:57.083 --> 12:59.458
-Look into the lens.
-Looking.

12:59.541 --> 13:01.250
-Hurry up, Doiley.
-Okay.

13:01.333 --> 13:03.250
Got it.

13:05.666 --> 13:07.000
Look at all this stuff.

13:07.750 --> 13:09.791
Yeah, Ronnie throws the best parties.

13:09.875 --> 13:13.541
You know, my dad was asking
if the party would have any adults.

13:13.916 --> 13:16.458
I said, "Please, Dad. We're 17 now!"

13:16.541 --> 13:19.000
My mom is the same with that.
"Say no to booze."

13:19.083 --> 13:20.541
Aunty Jeanie should know,

13:20.625 --> 13:23.083
that if her son's talking
to bottles, it's too late.

13:23.958 --> 13:26.208
-That's so funny.
-Thank you, Dilly.

13:26.291 --> 13:30.041
But Reggie's jokes got a cost.
Go on, I want a raspberry soda.

13:30.791 --> 13:32.708
-Okay. Do you want anything?
-No.

13:34.666 --> 13:36.833
Stop treating Dilly like your Man Friday.

13:37.875 --> 13:39.333
-I'm talking to you.
-Va!

13:41.416 --> 13:43.291
Welcome back, Veronica!

13:44.916 --> 13:46.375
You mean Va Va Voom?

13:51.083 --> 13:52.000
Hi! I missed…

13:52.083 --> 13:54.166
-Hello.
-You look lovely!

13:54.833 --> 13:56.875
-Hello, Moosey.
-Hi, Ronnie.

13:56.958 --> 13:58.708
Hello, Sughead.

13:58.791 --> 14:00.166
My name is "Jughead."

14:00.875 --> 14:03.000
What's the "S" for then?

14:03.083 --> 14:04.666
-Sandwich.
-Why?

14:06.166 --> 14:07.583
-Where are we going?
-"Why?"

14:07.666 --> 14:09.208
You still terrify Jughead.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.083
Hello.

14:11.916 --> 14:13.083
Hi, there.

14:13.166 --> 14:14.916
Since when did you get so cute?

14:15.666 --> 14:17.166
Thank you.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.541
-You look cute too, Arch.
-Thank you.

14:21.083 --> 14:23.750
-I have something for you.
-Oh, yeah?

14:28.791 --> 14:30.083
Ronnie! What?

14:30.166 --> 14:31.666
Ta-da!

14:32.500 --> 14:33.875
Fresh off the press.

14:34.666 --> 14:36.083
Happy birthday to me!

14:36.666 --> 14:38.125
Do you know how to dance?

14:39.500 --> 14:40.958
I learned after you left.

14:41.833 --> 14:43.916
And before you left is when I learned.

16:57.041 --> 16:59.666
-Good night! See you tomorrow.
-Bye. Drive safely.

16:59.750 --> 17:01.416
Yes, Aunty Betty.

17:04.000 --> 17:05.333
Listen. You guys go.

17:06.291 --> 17:07.125
Why? What is it?

17:07.208 --> 17:09.500
I forgot my record.
But you guys should go.

17:09.583 --> 17:11.583
-We can wait, Archie.
-No, no, I'll walk.

17:12.083 --> 17:13.666
-Bye.
-Okay.

17:28.875 --> 17:31.000
You forgot your record.

17:31.875 --> 17:33.083
What an old trick!

17:33.958 --> 17:35.375
The gift is dynamite.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.916
What can I possibly get you in return?

17:38.000 --> 17:39.416
Hmm.

17:39.500 --> 17:42.375
-Dinner? The CC.
-CC?

17:42.458 --> 17:43.500
Mm-hmm.

17:43.583 --> 17:45.375
Okay, great,
let me just sell my guitar then.

17:45.458 --> 17:48.125
If that's a problem for you,
I'm sure Reggie can handle it.

17:49.083 --> 17:51.958
Yeah. He pawned his guitar
before I came back.

17:54.166 --> 17:55.875
Don't worry. Dad has membership.

17:56.958 --> 17:58.333
No, I wanna cover it.

17:59.166 --> 18:00.333
Andrews!

18:00.416 --> 18:02.166
You get lost on the way out?

18:02.250 --> 18:03.375
No, sir.

18:04.041 --> 18:07.291
Then remove yourself
from my property this instant.

18:07.375 --> 18:10.541
Daddy, stop being mean
to Archie all the time.

18:10.625 --> 18:12.250
Everyone's entitled to a hobby.

18:13.125 --> 18:14.541
Now, Andrews.

18:16.291 --> 18:17.708
On second thought,

18:17.791 --> 18:19.208
your dad can cover the bill.

18:22.833 --> 18:23.875
Good night.

19:22.875 --> 19:26.500
"Riverdale Town Council
greenlights redevelopment."

19:26.583 --> 19:27.875
Take it easy, Fred.

19:28.041 --> 19:30.500
I know it's the reason
that bugger Lodge returned.

19:30.583 --> 19:33.500
Must be wanting to build
plazas everywhere.

19:33.583 --> 19:35.541
So, good. We need more things.

19:35.625 --> 19:39.166
We need air to breathe,
food to eat, and someone to love.

19:39.250 --> 19:40.541
We don't need "things."

19:40.625 --> 19:43.375
What will the difference
between Riverdale and anywhere else?

19:43.458 --> 19:46.000
Grammar, Fred. "What 'will be.'"

19:46.083 --> 19:48.208
Ah, trying to teach your father
how to suck eggs, huh?

19:48.291 --> 19:49.125
Yes, I am.

19:49.208 --> 19:50.500
-Archie!
-Yeah?

19:51.416 --> 19:53.625
-What is this?
-Why are you going through my stuff?

19:53.708 --> 19:56.708
Because I gave birth to you,
and you're still wet behind the ears.

19:57.041 --> 19:59.458
You applied to a university,
over in England?

20:00.375 --> 20:02.708
Uncle Ben said if I want to live there,

20:02.791 --> 20:05.375
it's better if I study there as well.

20:05.458 --> 20:07.208
You spoke to my brother first?

20:12.500 --> 20:14.375
You really want to leave Riverdale?

20:14.458 --> 20:16.416
London is the coolest city ever, Dad.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.500
Really?

20:17.583 --> 20:20.000
Yes! And I'm lucky
because I can go there easily,

20:20.083 --> 20:21.916
since Grandpa was British.

20:22.000 --> 20:23.208
And what will I do here?

20:23.291 --> 20:26.041
It'll be your travel agency,
or work on the railways.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.916
Imagine if Cliff Richard
had not left Lucknow.

20:29.625 --> 20:32.250
Trust me. Everything is possible there.

20:32.333 --> 20:35.458
I can make music that'll reach people.
Music that will really--

20:35.541 --> 20:38.916
To make art you have to go in,
my son, not out.

20:42.791 --> 20:46.000
"We know what we are,

20:47.083 --> 20:50.083
but know not what we may be."

20:51.000 --> 20:52.791
William Shakespeare said that.

20:54.833 --> 20:58.416
Nothing changes if nothing changes.

20:59.041 --> 21:01.666
-Dilly, I don't like riddles.
-But if you change

21:01.750 --> 21:04.375
-the way you look at life…
-Moose, it's a quote.

21:04.458 --> 21:05.666
Quote?

21:05.750 --> 21:09.708
…the life you look at will change. Hmm?

21:11.166 --> 21:12.250
Wonderful, wonderful!

21:12.333 --> 21:14.416
-Too good!
-Thank you.

21:16.958 --> 21:22.500
What Mr. Weatherbee is trying to say
is that change is inevitable.

21:22.583 --> 21:23.958
Excuse me, Miss Grundy.

21:24.791 --> 21:25.708
Yes, Mantle.

21:26.708 --> 21:28.583
If change is inevitable,

21:29.458 --> 21:31.916
then how come I didn't get mine back
from Jughead yesterday?

21:33.125 --> 21:34.500
Sorry, I used it for lunch.

21:34.583 --> 21:37.666
-Jughead for Principal!
-Very clever!

21:39.041 --> 21:42.375
Okay! You kids have a bright future ahead.

21:43.000 --> 21:47.291
-Juggy, do you know about "UGAJ"?
-Hmm? What's that?

21:47.375 --> 21:50.583
It's a group in school.
"United Girls Against Jughead."

21:51.416 --> 21:52.583
What did I do?

21:52.666 --> 21:53.791
I didn't join it.

21:54.708 --> 21:56.708
-Please join.
-Ha-ha. Very funny.

21:57.166 --> 21:58.791
How can they build a hotel here?

21:58.875 --> 22:00.583
What? Green Park will be gone?

22:04.458 --> 22:05.458
Thank you.

22:08.500 --> 22:10.458
This is not the time to get emotional.

22:11.625 --> 22:12.625
I need you both.

22:14.125 --> 22:15.208
Tell me.

22:19.416 --> 22:20.666
Can I depend on you?

22:21.291 --> 22:25.125
If you enter the Corporator election,
of course, you will have our vote.

22:25.208 --> 22:26.875
-Yeah.
-Give.

22:29.041 --> 22:30.541
When I win,

22:30.625 --> 22:32.375
I'll make you Council Head…

22:32.458 --> 22:33.625
Ah!

22:33.708 --> 22:37.041
…and nominate you
as Council Secretary. I promise.

22:37.125 --> 22:38.416
Mm-hmm.

22:38.500 --> 22:42.208
But Gomes? Right now, he's your secretary.

22:42.291 --> 22:44.041
True fact.

22:45.750 --> 22:47.875
But he has shown loyalty
only to Riverdale.

22:47.958 --> 22:50.416
He'll go straight
to the Gazette with this news.

22:53.875 --> 22:54.791
Knock, knock.

22:55.875 --> 22:56.791
Who's there?

22:56.875 --> 22:58.791
-Who?
-Who, who?

23:05.208 --> 23:09.041
Do you think your stupid jokes will help
you build a future, Reginald Mantle?

23:09.125 --> 23:11.125
Comedy is an art, Dad.

23:11.208 --> 23:13.416
I think there's
a real profession in comedy.

23:13.500 --> 23:17.875
A profession is a doctor, a lawyer,
engineer, a journalist!

23:19.375 --> 23:22.333
Your grandfather
didn't leave us this newspaper

23:22.416 --> 23:24.333
so we could write a jokes column.

23:26.166 --> 23:28.541
The British once ruled this country

23:29.375 --> 23:32.791
and the newspapers could only print
their propaganda at that time.

23:33.500 --> 23:35.916
No form of criticism was allowed.

23:37.583 --> 23:39.041
And despite all that,

23:39.583 --> 23:43.250
your grandfather printed messages here
about gaining support for freedom.

23:43.833 --> 23:44.833
Did you know that?

23:45.708 --> 23:49.041
And the same thing he did back then,
has become our job.

23:49.750 --> 23:52.083
And we have a social responsibility.

23:52.166 --> 23:54.166
Haven't I taught you that?

23:55.000 --> 23:56.750
Then forget this comedy.

23:57.250 --> 23:59.666
If you want to write,
then make it meaningful.

24:02.916 --> 24:03.916
You can go.

24:10.791 --> 24:15.708
"And as the Giraffe gazed at the stars,
she said, 'Drift me down into slumber.'"

24:16.291 --> 24:19.791
"'For when I'm the tallest,
I'm hoping to forget them.'"

24:20.333 --> 24:22.583
"'No matter how small-ish!'"

24:23.583 --> 24:25.291
-Yay. Once more.
-Again.

24:25.375 --> 24:26.333
Again?

24:26.416 --> 24:27.791
-Yes, again.
-Once more, Uncle Hal!

24:27.875 --> 24:29.416
-Thanks.
-Bye.

24:29.500 --> 24:30.583
-Let's go.
-Bye.

24:30.666 --> 24:31.750
Bye!

24:34.208 --> 24:35.041
Hal.

24:35.375 --> 24:38.208
Oh, Johnny, your timing's great.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.666
-Tea?
-Oh, no, thanks.

24:41.333 --> 24:45.083
I'm here to pick up Marge.
So I thought I'd have a word with you.

24:45.791 --> 24:47.166
Everything okay?

24:47.250 --> 24:50.166
So… The shop received
an offer today.

24:52.125 --> 24:53.708
It's a very good one, actually.

24:54.125 --> 24:55.750
I thought as my best tenant,

24:55.833 --> 25:00.125
I should ask you first
if you can match the price or not?

25:00.916 --> 25:02.708
The offer is?

25:02.791 --> 25:05.291
Uh…

25:05.375 --> 25:06.416
Double.

25:09.333 --> 25:10.333
Huh.

25:11.458 --> 25:14.541
I sell books, Johnny.
How can I come up with double?

25:17.583 --> 25:18.583
Sorry, my friend.

25:19.208 --> 25:22.208
All right. Well, I'll talk to Alice.

25:22.750 --> 25:23.666
I'll ring you.

25:24.625 --> 25:25.666
Hmm.

25:34.750 --> 25:36.458
What are we going to do, Dad?

25:39.375 --> 25:41.625
"You cannot swim for new horizons

25:41.708 --> 25:46.666
until you have the courage
to lose sight of the shore."

25:47.875 --> 25:49.333
William Faulkner.

25:49.416 --> 25:50.458
Dad.

25:51.083 --> 25:54.250
Don't worry, Betts.
We'll come up with a solution.

25:55.625 --> 25:57.000
But you tell me first…

25:58.458 --> 26:00.541
In eight hours, whose birthday is it?

26:01.250 --> 26:02.833
And what are you kids planning?

26:04.083 --> 26:06.916
Nothing. Think they forgot.

26:07.541 --> 26:08.416
I remembered.

26:15.041 --> 26:17.666
Yes, Ben,
but I need a ballpark figure.

26:18.125 --> 26:20.708
That's just tuition.
What about all the other stuff?

26:20.791 --> 26:21.625
How do I look?

26:21.708 --> 26:23.541
Just like you did an hour ago.

26:23.625 --> 26:24.625
Don't be grumpy, Mary.

26:24.708 --> 26:27.083
Shh. I'm trying to work out how
to fund your education.

26:27.166 --> 26:28.875
Uncle Ben said he'd take care of it.

26:29.625 --> 26:32.416
Your education is my problem.
I will take care of it.

26:33.083 --> 26:34.791
But I don't want to be a problem.

26:34.875 --> 26:36.208
Too late for that.

26:37.708 --> 26:39.500
Go. Bye.

26:41.125 --> 26:44.208
Really? I just got back
and you're going to London?

26:44.291 --> 26:47.250
-I've only just applied.
-You'll get in.

26:47.750 --> 26:49.958
Shoes are required
for dining.

26:50.041 --> 26:53.125
Shoes are the shackles
of our civilization, sir.

26:53.208 --> 26:57.458
And this is the protocol of our CC.
Only brogues or loafers.

26:57.541 --> 26:59.625
But I am a loafer.

27:01.416 --> 27:03.375
May I use your phone, please?

27:09.250 --> 27:11.958
Hello. Hi, Katy, can I speak to Daddy?

27:12.625 --> 27:14.791
-Who's Katy?
-My father's PA.

27:15.666 --> 27:18.750
You have to go through your dad's PA
to talk to him?

27:19.541 --> 27:21.083
He's a busy man.

27:22.291 --> 27:24.333
Hello. Hi, Daddy.

27:24.416 --> 27:27.083
Can you speak to this chappy at the CC?

27:27.166 --> 27:29.416
He is not letting Archie in.

27:30.916 --> 27:32.166
Mr. Lodge for you.

27:34.833 --> 27:36.250
Please follow me.

27:44.000 --> 27:46.375
Betty, would you get the door?

27:50.333 --> 27:51.166
Hot Dog?

27:51.250 --> 27:52.791
Surprise!

27:52.875 --> 27:55.666
Surprise!

27:55.750 --> 27:57.333
-Happy birthday!
-Thank you.

27:57.416 --> 27:58.708
Mwah.

27:58.791 --> 28:00.875
-Happy birthday, Betts. This is Rita.
-Thank you.

28:00.958 --> 28:02.291
-Hi, Rita.
-Happy birthday!

28:02.375 --> 28:03.750
-Happy birthday!
-Thank you.

28:03.833 --> 28:05.333
Where are Ronnie and Arch?

28:10.166 --> 28:11.291
Alice, come.

28:11.958 --> 28:14.625
Um, I'll have the trout
with the glazed potatoes.

28:14.708 --> 28:15.833
Very good, ma'am.

28:15.916 --> 28:16.791
And for you, sir?

28:16.875 --> 28:18.833
Does this lamb cure asthma?

28:19.500 --> 28:21.166
I don't think so, sir.

28:21.250 --> 28:23.083
Then why does it cost so much?

28:25.375 --> 28:26.375
Sorry.

28:27.166 --> 28:30.000
-Just get him the lamb. Thank you.
-Yes, ma'am.

28:32.208 --> 28:35.500
So, Archiekins? How's life going?

28:36.083 --> 28:37.291
I don't know where to start.

28:37.375 --> 28:40.375
You can begin where our story ended,
two years ago.

28:40.916 --> 28:42.375
Just been here, missing you.

28:42.458 --> 28:45.666
Tell me about it in detail, Archiekins.

30:59.375 --> 31:00.750
That was nice.

31:01.875 --> 31:03.083
I always have fun with you.

31:03.166 --> 31:05.791
Me too. I always have fun with me.

31:09.416 --> 31:11.333
So, um, what next?

31:11.416 --> 31:15.416
-Next?
-Yeah. You and me, like old times?

31:16.541 --> 31:20.291
Or you and me like this? New times.

31:29.708 --> 31:31.625
"To my Elizabeth…"

31:31.708 --> 31:32.916
Oh, Mom.

31:42.750 --> 31:44.625
Do you have any idea what time it is?

31:45.083 --> 31:46.666
-I'm hungry.
-Is that so?

31:46.750 --> 31:48.125
You had dinner with Ronnie.

31:48.208 --> 31:51.333
Have you eaten at the CC?
Everything is this "wee-wee."

31:51.916 --> 31:53.458
Tomorrow I have an early start.

31:53.541 --> 31:55.125
No, you don't. It's the weekend.

31:55.708 --> 31:56.958
Tomorrow's Saturday.

31:57.041 --> 31:57.958
Please.

32:05.041 --> 32:07.500
"Betty bought some butter,
but the butter was bitter--"

32:07.583 --> 32:08.500
Shut up!

32:10.958 --> 32:13.208
No one makes scrambled eggs
as amazing as you.

32:13.291 --> 32:16.083
And no one can
butter me up like you, Archie.

32:16.166 --> 32:17.416
Oh, really?

32:19.541 --> 32:22.125
So? Are you and Ronnie back together?

32:22.833 --> 32:24.875
No. That's old times.

32:28.375 --> 32:31.000
Um… Take this up to my room.
I need to clean up.

32:32.416 --> 32:34.458
-Quietly.
-Sorry. Thank you.

32:48.250 --> 32:51.125
"Happy birthday, Betty.
Please return what you don't eat."

32:52.291 --> 32:53.625
That's from Jughead.

32:57.291 --> 32:58.583
I saved this for you.

33:01.208 --> 33:02.583
I'm so sorry, Betty.

33:02.666 --> 33:05.208
I forgot your birthday.
I have no excuse.

33:05.291 --> 33:06.958
-It's okay.
-No, it's not!

33:07.041 --> 33:09.458
Please get angry.
Throw this cake in my face.

33:09.541 --> 33:11.500
I'd rather you eat it.

33:11.583 --> 33:12.583
Me too.

33:13.958 --> 33:16.041
Okay, listen. Tomorrow evening,
it's just you and me.

33:16.125 --> 33:18.375
At our favorite place, Green Park.

33:18.458 --> 33:19.458
For a date?

33:19.541 --> 33:22.625
Uh-huh. You and me. Good times.

33:27.875 --> 33:29.500
It's so cute!

33:30.500 --> 33:32.041
For always and ever.

33:32.125 --> 33:34.083
Thank you. I love it.

33:35.541 --> 33:36.666
Um…

33:36.750 --> 33:38.625
About last night, I'm sorry.

33:38.708 --> 33:40.500
You should be! You forgot me.

33:40.583 --> 33:43.750
-No! Don't say that.
-Well, what am I supposed to say?

33:43.833 --> 33:45.958
Just forgive me, please.

33:46.041 --> 33:47.375
Okay. Fine.

33:47.458 --> 33:51.208
She just gave you that expensive necklace,
because she forgot your birthday.

33:51.291 --> 33:53.750
Don't be mean. Ronnie is not like that.

33:53.833 --> 33:55.083
Mm-hmm.

33:55.166 --> 33:56.083
And Archie?

33:56.166 --> 34:00.291
-He's taking me out.
-He takes every girl out, Betts.

34:01.416 --> 34:02.583
But he can change.

34:03.083 --> 34:03.958
Listen.

34:04.708 --> 34:07.500
Archie and a dog's tail
are never gonna be straight.

34:08.333 --> 34:09.583
What did Ronnie say?

34:11.125 --> 34:12.791
I guess I haven't told her yet.

34:12.875 --> 34:16.083
Ooh! Forget about Archie,
look at him!

34:16.791 --> 34:18.416
Shammi Kapoor!

34:19.708 --> 34:22.416
Pam ma'am, are you selling the shop?

34:22.500 --> 34:24.083
Over my dead body.

34:24.666 --> 34:28.333
You heard, right? A new salon's going in
across the road?

34:28.416 --> 34:30.375
I know, I know!
Everybody is talking about it.

34:30.458 --> 34:34.208
My friend Asha told me they have
all kinds of fancy equipment.

34:34.291 --> 34:38.416
I don't need fancy equipment, darling.
I have Ethel.

34:42.541 --> 34:47.708
Pam's salon, Suzie's flower shop,
Hal's Book Shop.

34:48.833 --> 34:51.750
Send all of their owners
the developer's offer.

34:52.541 --> 34:55.458
Lodge Industries will build a plaza
in the town square.

34:56.708 --> 34:58.541
Understood, Gomes? Okay.

34:59.541 --> 35:01.125
Is that all for today?

35:01.208 --> 35:04.291
Yes, Mrs. Otter.
That is all for the day.

35:06.875 --> 35:10.708
Next session we vote
on the location of the hotel.

35:16.875 --> 35:18.833
Here's an idea I had.

35:20.458 --> 35:23.500
What if we build this grand hotel…

35:24.750 --> 35:26.625
in the center of the town?

35:26.708 --> 35:28.166
-Center?
-Yes.

35:28.250 --> 35:29.541
You mean the square?

35:31.666 --> 35:33.583
No. I mean the park.

35:33.666 --> 35:36.125
-Green Park?
-Yes!

35:36.208 --> 35:38.041
Imagine, Mrs. Misquitta,

35:38.125 --> 35:42.208
all the tourists we'll attract,
and how many new opportunities, huh?

35:42.291 --> 35:43.791
-It could change everything.
-Yes!

35:43.875 --> 35:45.208
Over my dead body, Roger.

35:45.291 --> 35:47.416
Has that wig eaten your brain?

35:50.041 --> 35:53.375
That is our community park, Mr. Dawson.

35:55.416 --> 35:56.958
You've had a very bad idea.

36:02.208 --> 36:04.125
Okay. Enjoy the biscuits.

36:04.208 --> 36:05.208
Oh, I will.

36:10.750 --> 36:13.875
That's Mrs. Misquitta.
Otter's minion.

36:15.333 --> 36:16.916
And this is Mrs. Otter.

36:17.458 --> 36:18.833
Oh, she's a widow?

36:19.375 --> 36:22.541
Yes. She's her family's sole bread-winner.

36:23.625 --> 36:24.833
Her son does nothing?

36:28.625 --> 36:30.166
How wonderful!

36:44.791 --> 36:47.375
Oh, my! Elizabeth Cooper.

36:48.416 --> 36:49.666
-That's Archie.
-I'll get it.

36:49.750 --> 36:53.500
Elizabeth, you know that you and the Queen
share the same name?

36:53.583 --> 36:54.500
Yes, Ma.

36:54.583 --> 36:58.083
So, your behavior should reflect
that of hers, like royalty.

36:58.166 --> 36:59.208
Yes, Ma.

36:59.958 --> 37:01.791
Listen to me now, Betty.

37:01.875 --> 37:05.291
That tingling feeling you get
when you like someone?

37:05.375 --> 37:07.583
That is common sense
leaving your body.

37:07.666 --> 37:09.041
Do not follow that feeling!

37:10.416 --> 37:12.750
No! Elizabeth!

37:15.666 --> 37:18.291
Va Va Voom, Betts! Happy Birthday!

37:18.375 --> 37:19.291
Arch!

37:20.500 --> 37:22.041
-This is for me?
-No.

37:22.125 --> 37:24.041
Of course. Who else would it be for?

37:24.125 --> 37:25.750
It was expensive, right?

37:25.833 --> 37:28.083
Yeah, I saved my pocket money.
Come, let's go.

37:28.916 --> 37:30.375
You look really nice, by the way.

38:21.625 --> 38:23.500
I'll really miss this place.

38:24.500 --> 38:27.333
I'm sure you'll find another tree,
monkey boy.

38:27.416 --> 38:29.041
London will have parks also.

38:29.125 --> 38:31.500
Yeah, but nothing
like Green Park, you know?

38:32.666 --> 38:34.333
They won't have our trees there,

38:35.291 --> 38:36.875
or my Betty Cooper there.

38:40.041 --> 38:40.875
What?

38:41.458 --> 38:43.541
Some moments are so special that

38:43.625 --> 38:45.875
you know when it's over
your heart will break.

38:48.083 --> 38:51.500
Hearts don't break, Betts.
They just fracture.

38:52.416 --> 38:53.833
Time heals everything.

38:54.416 --> 38:57.041
You're thinking
what a great philosopher I am, right?

38:57.125 --> 38:59.291
No, I'm thinking
what a big idiot you are.

39:01.750 --> 39:02.625
Where you going?

39:02.708 --> 39:04.458
Where do you think?

39:17.375 --> 39:19.208
I had the best birthday.

39:19.291 --> 39:21.250
You deserve it. You're the best girl.

39:41.583 --> 39:43.500
-Good night.
-Good night.

40:07.666 --> 40:09.125
You kissed Betty?

40:09.208 --> 40:10.166
Like "kissed" kissed?

40:10.250 --> 40:11.791
-With tongue?
-Shh. Jughead.

40:11.875 --> 40:13.750
Yes, it was a French kiss.

40:15.750 --> 40:17.958
I thought Ronnie was the one
you were into.

40:18.041 --> 40:20.416
-I was sure you liked her.
-I do.

40:20.500 --> 40:22.916
Ronnie is amazing,
but Betty is also first-class.

40:24.375 --> 40:27.166
And Cheryl,
Deena, Angie, Monica.

40:27.250 --> 40:28.500
You forget them?

40:28.958 --> 40:30.625
You've kissed them all in French?

40:30.708 --> 40:33.000
Well, what would you do
if they all liked you?

40:34.708 --> 40:38.041
Arch,
Betty and Ronnie are best friends.

40:38.125 --> 40:40.666
And sooner or later,
they're bound to talk about it.

40:40.750 --> 40:42.333
What'll they do then, Andrews?

40:42.416 --> 40:45.500
-Huh? You cannot two-time them.
-I'm not, though.

40:46.416 --> 40:47.958
I really love both of them.

40:52.333 --> 40:55.166
God! This is not gonna end well.

43:09.333 --> 43:10.833
-Andrews!
-What?

43:10.916 --> 43:12.208
Don't do this, please.

43:12.291 --> 43:15.166
When they find out the truth,
they'll murder you, Arch.

43:15.250 --> 43:17.708
-What do you want me to do?
-Just back off for now!

43:18.708 --> 43:21.541
If you die, then Moose
will have to be my best friend.

43:21.625 --> 43:23.208
I can't stop talking to them.

43:23.291 --> 43:24.708
Then act like a friend.

43:26.375 --> 43:29.375
Give another girl your focus, huh?
One with no complications.

43:29.458 --> 43:31.333
Forget Betty and Ronnie, huh?

43:32.625 --> 43:34.375
-Best.
-Best.

43:36.541 --> 43:38.125
Whoo! Cheryl!

43:40.500 --> 43:42.583
You were great, Cheryl.

43:42.666 --> 43:44.958
-What?
-Why waste time? Whoo!

43:45.041 --> 43:46.666
Three cheers for Cheryl!

43:46.750 --> 43:48.375
Cherry Blossom.

43:49.041 --> 43:51.000
Cherry Blossom.

43:51.625 --> 43:53.708
Cherry Blossom.

43:53.791 --> 43:54.666
What the hell!

43:54.750 --> 43:56.125
Cherry Blossom.

44:01.125 --> 44:04.208
I told you. A dog's tail.

44:04.291 --> 44:05.583
Cherry Blossom!

44:07.166 --> 44:08.833
Cherry Blossom!

44:26.041 --> 44:27.083
Hi.

44:27.916 --> 44:29.458
You're Ethel, right?

44:31.000 --> 44:32.625
Do you want to come take a look?

44:33.541 --> 44:34.625
Come on.

44:36.791 --> 44:38.041
Oh, shoot!

44:39.166 --> 44:40.791
Welcome to Cuts and Curls.

44:42.916 --> 44:46.125
You know, everyone says
you're Riverdale's upcoming hairdresser.

44:46.958 --> 44:48.583
I learned from the best.

44:48.666 --> 44:49.833
How nice!

44:49.916 --> 44:52.750
Having respect
for your teachers is quite noble.

44:53.750 --> 44:55.083
Something to drink?

44:55.666 --> 44:57.041
No, thank you.

44:57.125 --> 44:59.375
Then let me get straight to the point.

45:00.208 --> 45:02.875
Would you like to come work for me?

45:09.125 --> 45:11.458
-I already have a job at Pam ma'am's--
-I know.

45:12.541 --> 45:15.583
And I'm also aware of your salary there.

45:15.666 --> 45:18.291
Come work for me
and I'll double it, Ethel.

45:19.458 --> 45:22.333
You completely have the right
to get ahead in this world.

45:22.416 --> 45:24.958
They're going modern across the globe.

45:25.041 --> 45:26.458
Don't get left behind.

45:32.833 --> 45:36.583
Guys, is it just me,
or has Reggie been looking great?

45:41.291 --> 45:42.291
-It's you.
-It's you.

45:42.375 --> 45:44.250
-It's you.
-Hi.

45:46.125 --> 45:47.125
Hi.

45:56.083 --> 45:57.416
Reg.

45:58.833 --> 46:00.791
For the Founders' Ball, who's your date?

46:01.833 --> 46:04.333
Uh, well, I promised Lynn
that I would go with her.

46:04.916 --> 46:06.958
Promises are meant to be broken, Mantle.

46:12.125 --> 46:13.291
Poor Lynn.

46:15.750 --> 46:17.375
-She asked Reggie?
-Good.

46:17.458 --> 46:19.208
Give Cherry Blossom your focus now.

46:22.166 --> 46:23.541
I told you girls have powers.

46:23.625 --> 46:24.833
-She heard me.
-Shut up, Jug.

46:24.916 --> 46:26.541
-Hi.
-Hello.

46:26.625 --> 46:28.208
I thought I'd find you here.

46:28.291 --> 46:30.041
You have quite a memory!

46:30.125 --> 46:33.375
So then, Saturday? Founders' Ball?

46:33.458 --> 46:35.500
Make some memories?

46:39.750 --> 46:40.625
You got it.

46:44.375 --> 46:46.291
She asked you out! Very good.

46:46.375 --> 46:47.791
Va Va Voom!

46:49.458 --> 46:50.625
Guys, just shut up!

46:52.000 --> 46:55.541
-What is wrong with you, Archie Andrews?
-Nothing, Ethel Muggs. I'm single.

46:55.625 --> 46:57.416
No, you're just a philanderer!

46:57.500 --> 46:59.958
-Wait, what?
-His name's "Phil Anderson"?

47:00.041 --> 47:04.333
-Good morning, students.
-Good morning, teacher.

47:08.666 --> 47:11.208
Betty can't go alone.
She needs a date.

47:11.291 --> 47:13.458
My mom is taking me though.

47:13.541 --> 47:15.625
No. Aunty Jeanie will go with your dad,

47:15.708 --> 47:17.333
and you'll go as Betty's date.

47:17.416 --> 47:19.000
-Ronnie, don't bully him.
-I'm not.

47:20.083 --> 47:21.333
Dilly, am I bullying you?

47:22.750 --> 47:27.875
Don't you think Betty, Reggie, and me
are gonna be a lot more fun to go with?

47:27.958 --> 47:28.791
Reggie?

47:29.250 --> 47:30.833
Betty, I'd love to go with you.

47:31.666 --> 47:33.583
Great. Well, that's done!

47:36.750 --> 47:37.708
What's that?

47:37.791 --> 47:39.708
Are you inventing something?

47:39.791 --> 47:43.708
The invention was made years ago.
I'm simply trying to make one at home.

47:43.791 --> 47:45.916
What is it? A fridge?

47:46.000 --> 47:48.208
Ronnie, don't be ridiculous.

47:48.291 --> 47:50.500
When was the last time
you were in a kitchen?

47:51.166 --> 47:54.583
-That's a lovely picture of your grandma.
-I swear, you two, that's Hedy Lamarr.

47:54.666 --> 47:56.375
She invented frequency hopping.

47:56.458 --> 47:58.833
World War II was totally influenced
by her technology.

47:59.208 --> 48:01.791
Hedy Lamarr?
Wasn't she an actress, though?

48:01.875 --> 48:03.333
Why can't a person be both?

48:03.416 --> 48:05.500
-You're so smart, Dilly.
-Thank you!

48:05.583 --> 48:06.875
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

48:06.958 --> 48:07.875
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

48:07.958 --> 48:08.791
Thank you!

48:10.250 --> 48:12.750
All right. Here you are, Jughead.

48:13.625 --> 48:15.958
World's best biscuits, Uncle Benny.

48:16.041 --> 48:18.458
I'll make a box for you.
You have been my best client.

48:19.416 --> 48:21.625
Why "been"? I'm still here.

48:21.708 --> 48:24.291
Well, the license renewal isn't happening
with the City Council.

48:25.208 --> 48:27.250
They have new plans for the park.

48:28.333 --> 48:31.291
-Where did you hear that?
-No one said it straight up.

48:32.041 --> 48:34.625
But I have ears and eyes.

48:35.416 --> 48:36.750
And I can see, as well.

48:42.083 --> 48:43.958
They were at Pop's café too.

48:46.250 --> 48:47.875
-The elevation over there…
-Yeah.

48:47.958 --> 48:48.875
Redevelopment?

48:48.958 --> 48:50.208
Of Green Park, huh?

48:51.083 --> 48:52.083
Uncle Benny told me.

48:52.166 --> 48:54.333
The Council
is not renewing his license.

48:54.416 --> 48:56.375
Uncle Benny from the snack shop?

48:57.541 --> 48:58.541
Is that your source?

48:59.500 --> 49:01.041
I saw it with my own eyes, Dad.

49:01.125 --> 49:03.166
Some city men were surveying the place.

49:03.250 --> 49:06.458
-There's definitely a plan.
-What are you talking about, Reg?

49:07.166 --> 49:09.541
The community has its roots in Green Park.
Come on.

49:10.333 --> 49:13.541
The Council will never allow it.
They'll never pass it.

49:13.625 --> 49:16.708
Find facts, son, not conspiracy theories.

49:17.583 --> 49:19.333
Yeah, you're right, Ricky.

49:19.416 --> 49:21.208
Play on, Dennis.

49:32.875 --> 49:35.458
Weird.
Kevin never spoke about you.

49:35.541 --> 49:39.708
That was one of the things I respected
most about your husband, Mrs. Otter.

49:39.791 --> 49:41.250
He never name-dropped.

49:42.541 --> 49:45.166
He would personally
make my drink every evening,

49:46.291 --> 49:50.541
and with that whisky, we would also
share one cigarette between the two of us.

49:50.625 --> 49:53.875
-It was our ritual.
-But Kevin didn't smoke.

49:53.958 --> 49:54.916
Uh…

49:55.875 --> 50:00.041
Uh, he knew how much you hated it,
and didn't want to bother you.

50:00.125 --> 50:04.583
Well, he did die of cancer,
and that has been a bit of a bother.

50:05.416 --> 50:06.458
I know.

50:07.458 --> 50:09.791
And that is precisely
why I've called you here.

50:12.541 --> 50:16.166
Kevin was more than just a bartender here,

50:17.458 --> 50:18.541
he was a friend.

50:18.625 --> 50:24.458
And I feel it is my responsibility
to make sure that his son is well settled.

50:25.458 --> 50:27.666
Mm. Oh. My son.

50:29.083 --> 50:30.333
He's failed out twice.

50:31.125 --> 50:32.666
That Laurie is a duffer.

50:33.375 --> 50:35.750
Don't worry about that, Mrs. Otter.

50:35.833 --> 50:37.583
Because I've heard that the Town Council

50:37.666 --> 50:41.666
is considering giving approval for a hotel
to be built in Green Park.

50:41.750 --> 50:43.083
Can you believe that?

50:43.166 --> 50:45.916
-I'm not so sure--
-If that happens,

50:46.458 --> 50:48.083
I'm going to be investing in it.

50:48.791 --> 50:51.750
And maybe I could offer Laurie
a managerial position.

50:52.583 --> 50:54.750
He could work with me.

50:54.833 --> 50:58.458
I mean, if he has half of Kevin's looks,

50:58.541 --> 51:00.583
and a quarter of your charm,

51:01.208 --> 51:03.500
he would be perfect
in the service industry.

51:03.583 --> 51:07.500
The Council will vote after
the Founders' Ball. So, fingers crossed.

51:07.583 --> 51:09.041
We have to get a picture.

51:09.125 --> 51:11.916
Ronnie, I think
we need a photo together.

51:12.000 --> 51:13.583
Absolutely not.

51:13.666 --> 51:15.583
What? Why not?

51:15.666 --> 51:18.583
Because then everyone will know
I came with you.

51:18.666 --> 51:20.041
You did come with me.

51:20.125 --> 51:22.375
Yes.
But there's no need for proof.

51:23.583 --> 51:24.791
Smile!

51:34.875 --> 51:36.791
Afraid there's no hope.

51:38.208 --> 51:39.208
Sorry.

52:02.333 --> 52:04.333
Can we stop inviting him?

52:07.791 --> 52:09.125
Come.

52:09.750 --> 52:14.375
Hey, guys! No one told me
it's a fancy-dress competition.

52:14.458 --> 52:16.916
The first prize goes
to the chicken, right?

52:18.208 --> 52:19.750
Reggie. Reggie!

52:19.833 --> 52:21.333
-Hey, pipsqueak. Move.
-Don't push.

52:21.416 --> 52:23.416
Hey, man. Anybody home?

52:23.500 --> 52:25.125
Easy. It was just a joke.

52:25.208 --> 52:28.416
You make Dilly your joke, I'll pop you
like a champagne bottle, right now.

52:28.500 --> 52:30.875
Boys. Boys! The party hasn't even started

52:30.958 --> 52:33.250
and you little pissers
are at each other's throats.

52:33.333 --> 52:34.333
Off!

52:37.250 --> 52:40.250
You can dress how you want.
Okay? Come on.

52:42.000 --> 52:42.958
Very nice.

52:43.708 --> 52:45.083
Should we dance?

52:47.625 --> 52:48.458
Not to this.

52:48.541 --> 52:49.625
Look into the camera.

53:00.541 --> 53:01.666
I'll be right back.

53:01.750 --> 53:02.791
What the hell?

53:03.791 --> 53:04.791
Hi!

53:05.916 --> 53:07.708
Wait, Betts!

53:07.791 --> 53:10.125
What? Miss Blossom ditched you already?

53:10.208 --> 53:12.166
This could be my last Founders' Ball.

53:12.250 --> 53:14.000
I want us all to enjoy it together.

53:14.583 --> 53:17.625
Last? What do you mean?
You aren't coming back from England?

53:21.291 --> 53:23.333
Listen, I wrote you a song.

53:24.500 --> 53:25.666
Gonna play it tonight.

53:28.125 --> 53:29.916
I don't know what to say.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.125
Then don't say. Just dance.

53:38.750 --> 53:43.000
If you're desperate to chase Betty Cooper,
then why did you bring me here?

53:43.083 --> 53:44.625
You invited me, Cheryl.

53:44.708 --> 53:45.958
How rude!

53:46.041 --> 53:49.208
And I'll have you know
I was just trying to get Daryl jealous.

53:49.291 --> 53:50.166
So…

53:51.041 --> 53:52.833
Daryl is a lucky guy.

53:52.916 --> 53:54.875
-Go find your friends.
-I will.

53:57.916 --> 53:59.958
Nice.

54:02.750 --> 54:03.750
Nice dress.

54:05.541 --> 54:07.500
Can't say the same for your drapery.

54:08.458 --> 54:10.416
Ronnie, can I talk to you?

54:10.500 --> 54:12.791
What for? Cherries are out of season?

54:13.750 --> 54:14.708
That's funny!

54:16.333 --> 54:18.583
Personally, I think
every season is Ronnie season.

54:19.916 --> 54:24.083
Flattery will get you nowhere.
But keep trying, because I like it.

54:24.666 --> 54:27.041
All right then,
I wrote you a song.

54:28.583 --> 54:29.916
Will you forgive me now?

54:30.000 --> 54:32.541
First you gotta sing it to me
and then we'll see.

54:46.708 --> 54:49.833
-You're the best! You're amazing!
-Beautiful, Michael!

54:49.916 --> 54:51.750
Love you. And you.

54:51.833 --> 54:53.541
And me!

54:53.625 --> 54:55.166
The next number is--

54:55.250 --> 54:56.375
"Va Va Voom."

54:56.458 --> 54:58.291
-I didn't write that.
-I know.

55:01.000 --> 55:02.500
Good evening, everyone.

55:02.583 --> 55:04.791
On a night dedicated
to Sir John Riverdale,

55:04.875 --> 55:06.541
I'm going to perform a song

55:06.625 --> 55:08.708
I wrote for a really special girl
in my life.

55:10.666 --> 55:14.041
So let's hear it for our Founders
and give it up for the Archies!

55:20.291 --> 55:22.250
Can we clear the stage, please?

55:22.333 --> 55:23.708
On your mark, get set!

55:23.791 --> 55:25.416
One, two, three, go!

57:49.666 --> 57:51.375
We went through our books, Johnny.

57:52.666 --> 57:54.125
Double rent's impossible.

57:55.500 --> 57:57.000
Suzie has the same problem.

57:57.083 --> 57:58.750
She's giving up her flower shop.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.000
Why are you feeling guilty, you bugger?

58:02.083 --> 58:03.500
You do what you need to.

58:04.375 --> 58:05.958
Even Marge said the same thing.

58:06.041 --> 58:08.708
I feel like we should sell it all
and let's move to Sydney.

58:08.791 --> 58:10.041
Her brother's there, now.

58:10.666 --> 58:11.708
Wait, sell?

58:13.000 --> 58:15.125
-You're selling the shops?
-Hiram Lodge.

58:15.208 --> 58:18.000
They changed the offer
from double to buying.

58:18.083 --> 58:20.208
Uncle Hiram is gonna buy it all?

58:20.291 --> 58:22.041
He wants to buy every building.

58:22.125 --> 58:24.791
He's gonna bulldoze the block
and build a huge plaza.

58:24.875 --> 58:26.541
Please don't sell it.

58:26.625 --> 58:27.916
Betty.

58:33.083 --> 58:36.583
Can you vacate by the end of the week?

59:21.083 --> 59:24.208
You go on ahead.
I'm gonna be here a while.

59:24.291 --> 59:26.708
-You are?
-I work here till dinnertime.

59:26.791 --> 59:27.666
Shoot!

59:28.416 --> 59:29.625
Did you talk to Ronnie?

59:31.166 --> 59:33.750
-Your client's waiting, Missy.
-I'm coming.

59:34.958 --> 59:36.916
"Client's waiting, Missy."

59:47.208 --> 59:49.708
Andrews. It's from England.

01:00:02.583 --> 01:00:03.583
Mom!

01:00:07.208 --> 01:00:08.625
These are tough times.

01:00:09.333 --> 01:00:11.625
God knows
how long this café will even last!

01:00:12.625 --> 01:00:14.250
Well, I won't go anywhere, Pops.

01:00:14.875 --> 01:00:17.083
I'll stay no matter
how much anyone else offers.

01:00:17.166 --> 01:00:18.166
Excuse me?

01:00:19.375 --> 01:00:21.541
We have the right to try
to get ahead in this world.

01:00:21.625 --> 01:00:23.041
Morning, gang.

01:00:23.541 --> 01:00:25.125
Guess who got into Batterton College.

01:00:25.208 --> 01:00:28.250
-What?
-Hey! Congratulations!

01:00:28.333 --> 01:00:29.500
Nice work!

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000
-Congrats, Archie.
-Thank you. Thank you.

01:00:34.541 --> 01:00:37.916
-Hi. Hi! Congratulations!
-Hello. Thank you.

01:00:39.833 --> 01:00:43.541
Oh. Betty, you can't be looking so upset.
This is a great thing for Archie.

01:00:44.666 --> 01:00:49.208
Ronnie, I'm not upset 'cause of that.
They closed my dad's bookstore.

01:00:49.291 --> 01:00:50.166
What? Why?

01:00:50.250 --> 01:00:54.250
Because your dad decided to buy
all of the shops in the town square,

01:00:54.333 --> 01:00:56.375
bulldoze them, and put in a plaza.

01:00:56.458 --> 01:00:59.583
-That's not Ronnie's fault, though.
-Archie, I wasn't saying that.

01:01:01.375 --> 01:01:05.416
Betty, I had no idea.
I'm so sorry you're so upset, truly.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.791
He's going to lose his job
because of your father.

01:01:08.875 --> 01:01:10.416
Hey, that's not fair.

01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:11.833
Come on, Betts.

01:01:11.916 --> 01:01:13.375
What? It's true.

01:01:13.458 --> 01:01:16.375
Betty, my father
was also just doing his job.

01:01:16.458 --> 01:01:18.791
And he always says,
when you're doing business,

01:01:18.875 --> 01:01:20.708
you have to set aside your feelings,

01:01:20.791 --> 01:01:22.666
because it's not personal.

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:24.541
Your father doesn't know
what's personal.

01:01:24.625 --> 01:01:26.791
-Of course that's what he said!
-Excuse me?

01:01:26.875 --> 01:01:29.708
Ronnie, my father's more than
a book salesman, okay?

01:01:29.791 --> 01:01:33.541
He helps to shape the ideas
and personalities of children.

01:01:33.625 --> 01:01:35.416
He actually cares about them.

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:39.291
Meanwhile, you still have to contact
your own father's secretary

01:01:39.375 --> 01:01:41.291
if you want to speak to him, I mean…

01:01:48.083 --> 01:01:49.708
What just happened?

01:01:49.791 --> 01:01:50.916
I don't know.

01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:53.666
Why is she behaving like this?

01:01:54.166 --> 01:01:56.041
She's upset, and why wouldn't she be?

01:01:56.125 --> 01:01:59.291
You can't let profits rule everything.
For some people there's more to life.

01:01:59.375 --> 01:02:00.833
Go get stuffed, Jughead!

01:02:00.916 --> 01:02:04.083
My father is a businessman,
and I'm not gonna feel guilty about that.

01:02:04.166 --> 01:02:06.541
And I'm not gonna be apologetic
for my ambition.

01:02:06.625 --> 01:02:08.500
Easy, guys. Relax.

01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:10.041
It's all okay.

01:02:10.583 --> 01:02:12.583
Really? It's all okay?

01:02:15.291 --> 01:02:17.458
Okay, how come
you are leaving Riverdale, then?

01:02:17.541 --> 01:02:18.708
Hmm?

01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:26.791
Welcome to adulthood.

01:02:36.375 --> 01:02:37.583
Is Daddy in a meeting?

01:02:38.291 --> 01:02:40.041
He'll be free by 8:00 this evening.

01:02:43.916 --> 01:02:45.000
Mr. Lodge's office.

01:02:45.083 --> 01:02:47.500
Ah, finally, Frenny,
you've given me a card.

01:02:47.583 --> 01:02:48.416
Oh, hi.

01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:54.250
Are you free to talk, or do I need
an appointment for you as well?

01:02:54.791 --> 01:02:57.375
I always have time for melodrama.

01:02:57.458 --> 01:02:59.541
Excuse me, ladies.
I'll just be a moment.

01:02:59.625 --> 01:03:00.708
-Yes, sure.
-Sure.

01:03:00.791 --> 01:03:02.166
Stop looking at my cards, Frenny.

01:03:02.250 --> 01:03:04.333
Ronnie, honey. What's going on?

01:03:05.333 --> 01:03:07.666
Betty's father was evicted
from his bookshop.

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:08.791
Oh!

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:10.416
Sad.

01:03:11.166 --> 01:03:12.333
I like the Coopers.

01:03:12.416 --> 01:03:15.958
The landlord is going to sell
and Daddy's buying it.

01:03:17.333 --> 01:03:20.791
Darling, in all fairness,
it's the landlord's decision.

01:03:20.875 --> 01:03:23.416
But Uncle Hal has lost his livelihood.

01:03:24.041 --> 01:03:27.166
Cooper is a good man.
He'll find a job again, soon.

01:03:27.250 --> 01:03:30.625
-How do you know?
-Because I'll make sure of it.

01:03:32.541 --> 01:03:36.958
Now we commence the voting for permission
to build a grand hotel

01:03:37.041 --> 01:03:40.208
on the land which is now Green Park.

01:03:41.708 --> 01:03:43.541
I vote yea.

01:03:46.708 --> 01:03:47.750
Yea.

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:50.125
Nay.

01:03:50.208 --> 01:03:51.583
I say yea.

01:03:56.333 --> 01:03:57.416
I say nay.

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.958
I'm also a nay.

01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:08.208
I say yea.

01:04:16.083 --> 01:04:17.291
Mrs. Misquitta?

01:04:20.666 --> 01:04:22.083
It's up to you now.

01:04:27.458 --> 01:04:30.416
Um, I, sir, vote yea.

01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:31.541
What?

01:04:34.708 --> 01:04:36.583
You can't do this to Green Park!

01:04:36.666 --> 01:04:38.625
It's five votes
in favor of the hotel.

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:41.333
Gomes, inform the Gazette

01:04:41.416 --> 01:04:43.125
that we're accepting offers now.

01:04:43.208 --> 01:04:44.666
The hotel goes through!

01:05:04.708 --> 01:05:05.708
What's going on?

01:05:06.625 --> 01:05:07.833
Tell her, Hal.

01:05:10.958 --> 01:05:12.458
Well, the new bookstore going in?

01:05:13.666 --> 01:05:16.708
I've been offered
the assistant manager's post.

01:05:16.791 --> 01:05:17.666
I start tomorrow!

01:05:17.750 --> 01:05:20.500
-Can you believe it?
-Tell her what your new salary is.

01:05:21.583 --> 01:05:23.416
Don't show off, Alice.

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:28.500
Bless that Hiram Lodge.
He personally recommended me, Betts.

01:05:31.583 --> 01:05:32.958
What's wrong, baby?

01:05:42.458 --> 01:05:43.875
Have you come bearing gifts?

01:05:45.083 --> 01:05:47.458
Chocolate fudge! Your favorite.

01:05:49.958 --> 01:05:52.625
-What's the best thing about cake?
-What?

01:05:53.708 --> 01:05:55.541
Any time of day, it's delicious.

01:05:57.250 --> 01:06:00.291
You should've seen my dad's face.
He was so relieved.

01:06:00.375 --> 01:06:03.333
After the way I behaved,
what you did for my dad,

01:06:03.416 --> 01:06:05.041
I really don't know how to thank you.

01:06:07.958 --> 01:06:09.291
Do keep trying.

01:06:10.875 --> 01:06:11.958
Now tell me,

01:06:12.041 --> 01:06:13.833
-have you missed me like crazy?
-Of course.

01:06:15.625 --> 01:06:18.916
And let's not forget our school's motto.

01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.166
"There is no excellence without labor."

01:06:22.250 --> 01:06:25.750
And now to conclude this assembly,
we have an announcement.

01:06:25.833 --> 01:06:29.916
As of next month, Pop Tate's
will no longer run our cafeteria.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:30.916
What?

01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:35.583
The school will introduce pre-packed
lunchboxes from Chaplin and Company.

01:06:37.125 --> 01:06:38.541
-No.
-Thank you.

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:45.708
In London, we had pre-packed meals.

01:06:46.958 --> 01:06:49.208
Ronnie said that
it's normal in London.

01:06:49.791 --> 01:06:53.666
-So? It's okay 'cause it's normal there?
-That's not what I meant.

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:55.875
Mr. Chaplin doesn't have the power
to decide that.

01:06:55.958 --> 01:06:58.458
-We don't know that.
-But it's Pop Tate's, Archie!

01:06:59.791 --> 01:07:01.833
Pop makes my burgers with extra cheese.

01:07:01.916 --> 01:07:03.958
No tomatoes for Betty,
no mustard for Moose.

01:07:04.041 --> 01:07:05.541
He makes it for us.

01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:09.875
Well, Pop Tate's café
is, unfortunately, closing, Jughead.

01:07:09.958 --> 01:07:11.375
The school is growing.

01:07:12.041 --> 01:07:14.583
The funds used,
and the how and the when,

01:07:14.666 --> 01:07:16.875
the board has to make
some hard decisions.

01:07:17.708 --> 01:07:19.375
At the cost of what, Miss Grundy?

01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.625
Let's discuss that today.

01:07:23.375 --> 01:07:25.125
My dad wrote an article.

01:07:26.166 --> 01:07:28.166
Saying, all this redevelopment

01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:30.583
is in the interest
of a few large corporations.

01:07:31.958 --> 01:07:33.000
What does that mean?

01:07:33.083 --> 01:07:34.500
Don't take it personally.

01:07:34.583 --> 01:07:38.125
This discussion is about
public interest v. corporate interest.

01:07:40.541 --> 01:07:42.041
What are your thoughts, Archie?

01:07:44.666 --> 01:07:46.166
To be honest, Miss Grundy,

01:07:47.166 --> 01:07:49.666
I don't really think much
about that stuff.

01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:51.125
Oh!

01:07:51.208 --> 01:07:53.875
Wait. So, you don't think about your life?

01:07:53.958 --> 01:07:55.458
I get a huge kick out of life.

01:07:55.541 --> 01:07:59.291
But I just don't think about politics.
What's it got to do with my life?

01:08:00.333 --> 01:08:04.041
Who's going to tell Archie
what politics has to do with his life?

01:08:39.750 --> 01:08:40.583
No, Reggie!

01:11:07.041 --> 01:11:08.000
Hey! Hey!

01:11:11.416 --> 01:11:13.250
Sam said this book's really good.

01:11:13.333 --> 01:11:15.666
-Yeah, looks good.
-It's a detective story.

01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:17.791
-I don't know.
-So, should we get it?

01:11:17.875 --> 01:11:19.500
-Hardy Boys fans, huh?
-Yeah.

01:11:19.583 --> 01:11:20.750
Then read this too.

01:11:20.833 --> 01:11:23.833
Anglo chap. Remember his name.
Ruskin Bond.

01:11:23.916 --> 01:11:25.250
Ruskin Bond. Cool.

01:11:26.291 --> 01:11:28.291
-Excuse me?
-Yeah?

01:11:28.375 --> 01:11:30.083
-Can I have a word with you?
-Sure.

01:11:30.750 --> 01:11:35.000
Well, in the town square,
the bookstore there was mine.

01:11:35.625 --> 01:11:37.708
-Oh, really?
-Hal's.

01:11:37.791 --> 01:11:40.375
And every week, I had
a story hour for children.

01:11:40.875 --> 01:11:42.500
It's actually a great idea.

01:11:42.583 --> 01:11:44.000
How much do you charge for it?

01:11:44.083 --> 01:11:47.083
Nada! All free. Just to instill
a love for books, that's all.

01:11:48.875 --> 01:11:53.458
See, Hal. We want to attract the kind of
customers here who'll actually buy things.

01:11:53.541 --> 01:11:57.916
If it's just to entertain the kids,
it's not profitable to the bookstore.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.833
We've got monthly targets
to achieve, right?

01:12:00.833 --> 01:12:03.291
Yeah? Let me know
if there's anything else though.

01:12:11.625 --> 01:12:13.833
-Mary.
-How lovely, Alice.

01:12:13.916 --> 01:12:15.916
-Thank you.
-That looks excellent.

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.041
-See you later.
-Sorry to keep you waiting.

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:19.250
Hi, Ethel.

01:12:19.750 --> 01:12:21.083
I hope you're coming tonight.

01:12:21.166 --> 01:12:23.416
Of course, aunty.
As soon as I'm done with my shift.

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:24.791
Great.

01:12:25.958 --> 01:12:28.125
Oh, dear. I forgot to bring my wallet.

01:12:28.916 --> 01:12:30.958
-No credit.
-I'm so sorry.

01:12:31.041 --> 01:12:32.541
-I was in such a rush--
-Don't worry.

01:12:32.625 --> 01:12:34.333
You can bring it anytime tomorrow.

01:12:34.416 --> 01:12:36.333
Thank you. Thank you.

01:12:37.958 --> 01:12:40.666
Next time I'm dealing
with my clients, don't interfere, got it?

01:12:41.666 --> 01:12:44.541
Interfere? That's Aunty Mary.

01:12:44.625 --> 01:12:46.250
I don't care.
The rules are very clear.

01:12:47.041 --> 01:12:48.875
I'm paying you double your salary.

01:12:49.583 --> 01:12:50.875
Now go get the money from her.

01:12:53.833 --> 01:12:55.500
What are you looking at, stupid?

01:12:55.583 --> 01:12:58.291
-Do you not understand my words?
-Please don't talk to me like that!

01:12:58.375 --> 01:13:01.333
And no amount of money will get me
to be mean to my friend's mother.

01:13:01.416 --> 01:13:02.375
Excuse me?

01:13:17.541 --> 01:13:18.958
Yes? Can I help you?

01:13:19.666 --> 01:13:21.291
Can I please have my job back?

01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:25.000
I made a mistake.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:27.625
Can you forgive me?

01:13:30.166 --> 01:13:31.041
Come.

01:13:34.791 --> 01:13:36.625
Twenty years!

01:13:37.375 --> 01:13:39.250
And I still carry her picture.

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:43.125
You always were a tight ass, Fred.

01:13:46.541 --> 01:13:47.666
In my wallet.

01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:50.000
All right, Fred. We believe you.

01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:53.958
And when times get rough,
I take it out

01:13:54.041 --> 01:13:55.291
and I remind myself

01:13:55.375 --> 01:13:57.333
that I can survive anything,

01:13:57.416 --> 01:14:00.500
if I've survived being married to Mary!

01:14:01.416 --> 01:14:03.375
Very funny, Fred.

01:14:03.458 --> 01:14:05.208
-Cheers!
-Give her a kiss!

01:14:05.291 --> 01:14:06.500
Kiss!

01:14:06.583 --> 01:14:08.416
The kids always get in the way.

01:14:12.958 --> 01:14:15.916
Since Archie's leaving,
shouldn't we plan a farewell?

01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:17.875
Daddy could let us
use the lake house.

01:14:17.958 --> 01:14:19.000
Oh, yeah!

01:14:20.416 --> 01:14:22.916
Well, look who's first in line.

01:14:23.583 --> 01:14:25.375
He loves strawberry shortcake.

01:14:26.791 --> 01:14:29.208
-You make him so nervous.
-Good.

01:14:29.291 --> 01:14:31.541
I quit the salon
and went back to Pam ma'am.

01:14:32.583 --> 01:14:33.583
Good girl.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.416
I'm not your dog, Juggy.

01:14:51.250 --> 01:14:52.916
-Come on. Come!
-Not me. You go.

01:15:39.500 --> 01:15:40.875
Yeah, you play it, boy!

01:16:12.708 --> 01:16:13.791
I wish I had two hearts.

01:16:21.666 --> 01:16:22.916
I wish you had one brain.

01:16:24.541 --> 01:16:28.458
It's true. I really don't get
how anyone can love just one person.

01:16:30.125 --> 01:16:32.125
Archie, it's your parents'
20th anniversary.

01:16:32.208 --> 01:16:33.416
What a great topic, huh?

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:35.000
I'm serious, Juggy.

01:16:35.083 --> 01:16:37.583
One should not have to control
how much love they have to give.

01:16:37.666 --> 01:16:39.875
And besides, how can you find
everything in one person?

01:16:40.708 --> 01:16:43.750
Imagine if you had to choose between
Paul McCartney and John Lennon.

01:16:44.500 --> 01:16:46.083
Like choosing between rock and roll.

01:16:48.458 --> 01:16:49.791
That's the very same feeling

01:16:50.958 --> 01:16:52.500
cakes and shakes put me on.

01:16:53.375 --> 01:16:54.416
Shut up!

01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:55.541
Where you going?

01:17:32.291 --> 01:17:33.500
Happy anniversary!

01:17:33.583 --> 01:17:34.750
-Thank you, Juggy.
-Hello!

01:17:34.833 --> 01:17:37.750
-Hey, hey, hey!
-You stay away from my wife!

01:17:37.833 --> 01:17:39.416
-You stay away from me!
-Hal!

01:17:39.500 --> 01:17:41.208
You stay away from my wife!

01:17:41.291 --> 01:17:43.333
-Hal!
-Come on…

01:17:43.416 --> 01:17:45.208
-I'm fine. I'm--
-Michael, shut up.

01:17:48.250 --> 01:17:49.250
What?

01:17:49.333 --> 01:17:51.833
Green Park will be converted into a hotel?

01:17:53.750 --> 01:17:54.625
Yes.

01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:57.833
The Gazette has to put out
a call for offers.

01:17:57.916 --> 01:17:59.416
And how will they do that?

01:17:59.500 --> 01:18:01.791
They're saying they'll reserve
a section for residents.

01:18:01.875 --> 01:18:03.583
Riverdale's residents, or the hotel's?

01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:06.333
You were right, Reg.

01:18:08.166 --> 01:18:09.750
Let's look at the bright side.

01:18:09.833 --> 01:18:12.416
If the tourists are there,
the jobs are also there.

01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:13.875
The jobs "will" also there.

01:18:13.958 --> 01:18:15.708
Well, that's also wrong.

01:18:15.791 --> 01:18:17.583
Bloody hell, I never get it right.

01:18:17.708 --> 01:18:20.208
More tourists mean more business
for you, Fred.

01:18:20.291 --> 01:18:21.250
Dad, Green Park--

01:18:21.333 --> 01:18:24.250
I'm sorry, but not everything
is about profit, Jones.

01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:28.291
-Can't you all do something together?
-What can we do, Reg?

01:18:28.875 --> 01:18:30.666
Some big people must be behind this.

01:18:31.750 --> 01:18:33.541
People like us don't matter.

01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:37.583
Uncle Ricky, how about if you speak
to the Council?

01:18:38.166 --> 01:18:39.250
I tried.

01:18:40.041 --> 01:18:42.083
Only Esther and Gomes
are against it.

01:18:42.208 --> 01:18:44.833
Money makes the world go around, Mantle.

01:18:44.916 --> 01:18:46.541
It's a really sad reality.

01:18:46.625 --> 01:18:48.500
They also closed down
our bookstore.

01:18:48.583 --> 01:18:50.625
Maybe we should see
what we can get in return.

01:18:50.708 --> 01:18:53.083
-In return for Green Park?
-Baby.

01:18:53.708 --> 01:18:56.416
That's where we were the day
Independence was declared.

01:18:58.208 --> 01:18:59.541
These kids had just been born.

01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:04.083
Their first steps in free India

01:19:05.541 --> 01:19:06.833
were taken in Green Park.

01:19:09.666 --> 01:19:11.625
How can you put a price on that, Alice?

01:19:13.416 --> 01:19:16.416
I know. It is what it is, Fred.

01:19:17.791 --> 01:19:18.833
Hey, Dad.

01:19:21.291 --> 01:19:23.250
I want to interview the Council Head.

01:19:25.208 --> 01:19:26.541
Go ahead. Do it.

01:19:27.125 --> 01:19:28.291
I'm coming with you.

01:19:32.625 --> 01:19:35.666
London, Paris, New York,
I have heard all these places

01:19:35.750 --> 01:19:38.666
offer a grand hotel
in the heart of town.

01:19:38.750 --> 01:19:41.666
And I've heard,
they also offer parks that are central.

01:19:43.250 --> 01:19:45.416
You have a number in your eye, or what?

01:19:45.500 --> 01:19:47.625
Listen, why do you need this park?

01:19:47.708 --> 01:19:49.666
Everywhere you look, there is greenery.

01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:51.083
Green Park is our history.

01:19:51.166 --> 01:19:53.583
Those are our trees.
That's where we've grown up.

01:19:53.666 --> 01:19:57.083
Come on, the hotel will keep a portion
for their private gardens.

01:19:57.166 --> 01:19:59.625
Everything won't be ripped out. I promise.

01:20:01.166 --> 01:20:02.916
-What?
-Ripped out?

01:20:04.208 --> 01:20:05.916
They plan to cut the trees?

01:20:06.750 --> 01:20:08.375
See, the Town Council has passed it.

01:20:08.458 --> 01:20:11.833
And Riverdale's citizens are the ones
who elected the Council.

01:20:11.916 --> 01:20:13.333
It was all democratic.

01:20:13.416 --> 01:20:16.291
But what if
the people don't agree with them?

01:20:16.375 --> 01:20:17.833
Who are these people?

01:20:18.666 --> 01:20:21.000
The Council's decision
can be reversed.

01:20:21.083 --> 01:20:22.666
-Really?
-Yes.

01:20:22.750 --> 01:20:26.666
If served a petition signed by more
than 50% of Riverdale's population.

01:20:27.541 --> 01:20:30.791
-What are you talking, Gomes?
-And how many people would that be?

01:20:31.208 --> 01:20:33.041
4500 should be enough.

01:20:33.125 --> 01:20:36.500
Our current population is 8876.

01:20:36.583 --> 01:20:38.375
How much time
do we have for this petition?

01:20:38.458 --> 01:20:40.416
Forty-five days
since Council passed it.

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:43.125
-Forty-five days?
-The whole school will sign it, right?

01:20:43.208 --> 01:20:45.958
The petition can only be signed
by those 18 and above.

01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:47.000
Yes.

01:20:48.458 --> 01:20:50.125
Because children don't count.

01:20:51.666 --> 01:20:52.916
Thank you.

01:20:54.416 --> 01:20:57.583
Wait. So our parents don't count,
we don't count.

01:20:57.666 --> 01:20:59.333
Then who does count in this town?

01:21:00.041 --> 01:21:00.875
I don't know.

01:21:00.958 --> 01:21:03.875
If we actually let them take this park,
they won't stop there.

01:21:03.958 --> 01:21:05.833
Trust me. They won't save
a single tree.

01:21:05.916 --> 01:21:08.375
Hey, don't lose hope.
A petition might work.

01:21:08.458 --> 01:21:09.375
How so?

01:21:09.458 --> 01:21:12.125
If at least
half of Riverdale's residents sign it,

01:21:12.208 --> 01:21:13.541
they can't do anything.

01:21:13.625 --> 01:21:15.041
That's the law.

01:21:16.083 --> 01:21:18.875
I'm going to write an article
to inform the whole town.

01:21:18.958 --> 01:21:21.208
Can we reach
4000 people through your paper, Reg?

01:21:22.333 --> 01:21:23.583
The Gazette goes to everyone.

01:21:24.083 --> 01:21:26.166
But how will we collect the signatures?

01:21:26.250 --> 01:21:28.541
The paper can only print the article.

01:21:29.125 --> 01:21:32.375
Okay, so at the end of the article,
put instructions, you know.

01:21:32.875 --> 01:21:37.416
"Dear reader, if you wish to save
Green Park, write a note, sign it,

01:21:37.500 --> 01:21:41.000
and then send it via mail
to the posted address." Simple!

01:21:41.083 --> 01:21:42.750
Doiley, you're a genius, huh?

01:21:42.833 --> 01:21:43.916
Thank you.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.750
-Thank you.
-Thank you!

01:21:45.833 --> 01:21:48.291
Good thing Dilly's
not going to London with Archie,

01:21:48.375 --> 01:21:50.333
or else we would lose the park.

01:21:50.416 --> 01:21:52.500
-Shut up, Jughead.
-It's true.

01:21:53.208 --> 01:21:54.625
So, Archie, all set?

01:21:54.708 --> 01:21:55.958
Yes, Uncle Ben, all set.

01:21:56.041 --> 01:21:59.166
Okay. I'm going to be at the airport
to pick you up.

01:21:59.250 --> 01:22:00.625
Yeah, that'd be great. Thank you.

01:22:00.708 --> 01:22:02.916
And your aunt,
she's redone the room for you.

01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.500
Can I get you anything from here?

01:22:04.583 --> 01:22:06.583
Yes, please, some Kul-kuls.

01:22:06.666 --> 01:22:08.041
Kul-kuls. Okay.

01:22:08.125 --> 01:22:10.041
Oh, and some spicy salt fish pickles.

01:22:10.125 --> 01:22:12.000
Spicy salt fish pickles.
Okay, I'll tell Mom.

01:22:12.666 --> 01:22:13.750
You're excited?

01:22:14.458 --> 01:22:16.333
Yeah, I am excited.

01:22:16.416 --> 01:22:17.916
Well, I am glad to hear that.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:20.583
There's nothing left for you
in Riverdale, Archie.

01:22:20.666 --> 01:22:23.291
You'll love it here.
Your life is about to start.

01:22:33.333 --> 01:22:34.375
Reginald Mantle.

01:22:35.583 --> 01:22:38.166
-This is very, very good.
-So you'll print it?

01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:41.583
-Dennis.
-Yes.

01:22:41.666 --> 01:22:43.208
Shift all the articles around.

01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:45.291
-Monday morning front page.
-Okay.

01:22:45.375 --> 01:22:48.791
-My son has come of age.
-Oh, my God! Andrews!

01:22:49.541 --> 01:22:50.666
It's done!

01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:54.875
For a moment I thought
he was giving me a jokes column.

01:22:54.958 --> 01:22:57.083
You wouldn't use it.
He's not very funny.

01:22:57.166 --> 01:22:59.958
One day you'll realize
the value of a comedian.

01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:01.458
When will it be printed, uncle?

01:23:01.541 --> 01:23:05.083
Come back from your holiday,
and it'll be in the paper.

01:23:07.333 --> 01:23:10.916
Welcome to
the "I Love Archie" farewell weekend.

01:23:12.750 --> 01:23:16.041
We have T-shirts.

01:23:16.833 --> 01:23:18.500
And some shades.

01:23:20.416 --> 01:23:23.625
Dilly, please remember,
camera on my left profile only,

01:23:23.708 --> 01:23:25.166
uh, and this height.

01:23:25.250 --> 01:23:28.250
So we'll just have to find a way
for you to shoot yourself then.

01:23:29.833 --> 01:23:30.708
I have.

01:23:30.791 --> 01:23:33.958
Oh, you have a film camera
and you still don't know

01:23:34.041 --> 01:23:36.791
that, "Cinema is truth
24 times a second."

01:23:36.875 --> 01:23:39.041
The French director Godard
was who said that.

01:23:39.125 --> 01:23:41.541
How you look is not what's important,

01:23:41.625 --> 01:23:44.541
it's how you feel, guys, you know.
That's what's important.

01:23:48.791 --> 01:23:49.916
Thank you.

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:52.250
Thank you!

01:24:02.375 --> 01:24:04.625
I heard you had news.

01:24:04.708 --> 01:24:06.583
This better be good, Dennis.

01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:16.375
Hey, Reg, I jumped in first.

01:24:17.041 --> 01:24:20.083
-The water looks a bit cold.
-You can tell by looking? Wow.

01:24:21.625 --> 01:24:22.958
Just push him in, Betts.

01:24:23.041 --> 01:24:26.333
-What?
-Best idea since sliced bread.

01:24:30.041 --> 01:24:32.958
-Why are you all on my case?
-Because you're a scaredy cat.

01:24:33.041 --> 01:24:34.916
What? No.

01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:37.000
Just come in, Reggie. It's lovely.

01:24:38.041 --> 01:24:38.958
Truth or dare?

01:24:39.041 --> 01:24:41.083
Say you're a scaredy cat or jump in!

01:24:43.125 --> 01:24:48.875
Scaredy-cat. Scaredy-cat.
Scaredy-cat. Scaredy-cat.

01:24:48.958 --> 01:24:53.333
Scaredy-cat. Scaredy-cat.
Scaredy-cat. Scaredy-cat.

01:24:57.625 --> 01:24:58.625
I choose dare.

01:24:59.416 --> 01:25:02.083
I dare you to give me a beat right now,

01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:04.958
-or kiss one of the girls.
-Excuse me?

01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:06.541
That's not funny.

01:25:09.166 --> 01:25:10.583
I don't have my drumsticks here.

01:25:13.375 --> 01:25:14.625
Exactly!

01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:26.958
Are you making that sound
with your mouth?

01:25:28.375 --> 01:25:31.750
-He's a musical genius.
-He's a weirdo.

01:25:33.458 --> 01:25:34.541
Good save, Juggy.

01:25:34.625 --> 01:25:36.208
Now, Dilly, your turn.

01:25:36.291 --> 01:25:37.333
Truth.

01:25:37.416 --> 01:25:40.333
Tell us a secret you have
that nobody would know.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:41.875
Or dare?

01:25:42.541 --> 01:25:45.375
-Do 50 push-ups.
-Please. I don't wanna see that.

01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:48.416
Dilly, for your dare,

01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:50.583
you will have to throw
your camera in this direction

01:25:50.666 --> 01:25:52.458
and the girl who catches it, keeps it.

01:25:54.208 --> 01:25:56.583
Come on, Dilly. Truth or dare?

01:25:56.666 --> 01:25:59.250
Truth. No, dare!
I want that camera. Dare.

01:26:02.250 --> 01:26:03.250
What?

01:26:03.333 --> 01:26:04.791
No, Dilly, you love that camera.

01:26:04.875 --> 01:26:06.625
Tell us a secret and the camera's yours.

01:26:12.291 --> 01:26:15.333
Why are you thinking so much?
All of us have secrets. It's all right.

01:26:17.583 --> 01:26:18.916
Come on, Dilly.

01:26:28.333 --> 01:26:29.541
What happened?

01:26:38.333 --> 01:26:41.000
What happened, Dilly? Are you okay?

01:26:41.083 --> 01:26:42.416
It's all right, Dilly.

01:26:42.500 --> 01:26:45.125
It's just a stupid game.
You don't have to answer it.

01:26:45.208 --> 01:26:49.708
I really didn't want to ruin
everybody's mood. I am sorry.

01:26:50.333 --> 01:26:53.333
I promise, it's okay, Dilly.
We're all friends here.

01:26:54.416 --> 01:26:55.541
I know. I know.

01:26:55.625 --> 01:26:58.208
It's your party,
you can cry if you want to.

01:27:11.833 --> 01:27:12.833
Are you awake?

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.000
My eyes are open, Reggie.

01:27:19.458 --> 01:27:21.583
I wanted to say something.

01:27:23.291 --> 01:27:24.958
You're not a scaredy-cat like me.

01:27:25.916 --> 01:27:27.833
You are the bravest guy I know.

01:27:31.791 --> 01:27:35.958
And I know how you feel about me.

01:27:38.250 --> 01:27:39.791
And I also know

01:27:41.083 --> 01:27:42.916
for you, it's gotta be so hard,

01:27:44.583 --> 01:27:47.041
'cause, um, I don't feel that way.

01:27:48.458 --> 01:27:50.708
I just want to say that,

01:27:51.583 --> 01:27:52.791
that I'm here for you.

01:27:54.333 --> 01:27:55.833
And I always will be.

01:27:57.625 --> 01:28:00.875
And don't worry,
I'm not gonna tell anyone else.

01:28:00.958 --> 01:28:02.166
It's your story to tell.

01:28:03.208 --> 01:28:04.083
Okay?

01:28:11.250 --> 01:28:12.250
Good night.

01:28:12.875 --> 01:28:13.875
Good night.

01:28:17.416 --> 01:28:19.750
"Records seem to have nearly survived…"

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:50.916
Where is Ricky Mantle?

01:29:11.083 --> 01:29:12.208
Good morning.

01:29:12.291 --> 01:29:14.291
It's a bit early to look this foxy.

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:17.791
I thought Reggie would be
the one up first.

01:29:18.250 --> 01:29:19.916
He is losing his touch.

01:29:22.583 --> 01:29:24.125
Reggie isn't the one
you're waiting on.

01:29:24.208 --> 01:29:26.958
Oh, yeah? Then tell me.
Who was I waiting on?

01:29:38.583 --> 01:29:39.583
Was I right?

01:29:46.375 --> 01:29:47.375
Come.

01:29:57.833 --> 01:30:00.291
-Good morning, Betts.
-What so good about this morning?

01:30:02.625 --> 01:30:03.708
Hi.

01:30:09.958 --> 01:30:11.375
Betty just bit my head off.

01:30:11.458 --> 01:30:13.500
What? Betty doesn't bite.

01:30:13.583 --> 01:30:15.958
You must've done something wrong
to upset her.

01:30:17.208 --> 01:30:19.583
All aboard, please. All aboard!

01:30:19.666 --> 01:30:22.333
Yes, Smithers.
We're sailing away soon.

01:30:22.416 --> 01:30:24.250
Anchors aweigh, old chap.

01:31:40.333 --> 01:31:42.583
The Town Council
does not want a dispute.

01:31:42.666 --> 01:31:43.791
What dispute?

01:31:43.875 --> 01:31:46.333
We're only informing the people
that they have a choice.

01:31:46.416 --> 01:31:47.791
I know, Reg, but…

01:31:47.875 --> 01:31:51.125
It was you that said,
"If you wanna write, then make it count."

01:31:52.333 --> 01:31:54.416
-You said it was good, Dad.
-And it is.

01:31:54.500 --> 01:31:55.458
So then?

01:31:55.541 --> 01:31:57.958
Hiram Lodge is the one who's building it.

01:31:59.083 --> 01:32:00.083
What?

01:32:01.208 --> 01:32:03.375
The Gazette's main source
of advertising revenue

01:32:03.458 --> 01:32:04.958
is Lodge Industries and Hiram.

01:32:05.041 --> 01:32:07.458
And if I print this article,
the money will stop,

01:32:07.541 --> 01:32:09.500
he'll shut us down.
The publication is finished.

01:32:10.083 --> 01:32:12.125
-He said that?
-Yes, he did.

01:32:14.833 --> 01:32:16.750
I have to look at the bigger picture, son.

01:32:16.833 --> 01:32:18.958
And what about the free press
Grandpa fought for?

01:32:19.041 --> 01:32:20.958
Did you forget about that?

01:32:21.041 --> 01:32:24.375
What about the social responsibility
you were saying I should take?

01:32:34.291 --> 01:32:35.583
See you, Uncle Ricky.

01:32:47.083 --> 01:32:49.208
-I wanna talk to you.
-Not now.

01:32:50.708 --> 01:32:52.041
Is everything okay, Betts?

01:32:58.708 --> 01:32:59.791
She's here.

01:33:04.208 --> 01:33:05.208
Hi.

01:33:05.916 --> 01:33:08.958
-Your dad's building the hotel?
-What are you talking about?

01:33:09.041 --> 01:33:11.333
-He's gonna destroy Green Park.
-No, he's not.

01:33:11.416 --> 01:33:13.208
He wouldn't let us run the article.

01:33:14.041 --> 01:33:16.208
-He threatened my father.
-What?

01:33:16.291 --> 01:33:18.000
Did you tell him
about the article, Ronnie?

01:33:18.083 --> 01:33:20.125
No, why would I even mention that?

01:33:21.291 --> 01:33:22.583
How dare he accuse me!

01:33:23.375 --> 01:33:25.666
Your dad couldn't have heard
from anyone else.

01:33:40.833 --> 01:33:42.333
He's on a call, Ronnie.

01:33:43.083 --> 01:33:43.916
Ronnie!

01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:45.833
No, no, that sounds perfect.

01:33:46.541 --> 01:33:50.833
In fact, I was thinking
we could announce it at Christmas.

01:33:51.666 --> 01:33:52.875
I'm busy, darling.

01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:54.416
Yes.

01:33:57.750 --> 01:33:59.500
Look, I'm going to have to call you back.

01:34:05.750 --> 01:34:07.916
-No school today?
-You threatened Uncle Ricky?

01:34:09.291 --> 01:34:10.583
I did no such thing.

01:34:10.666 --> 01:34:12.250
Why did the article not go to print?

01:34:12.333 --> 01:34:16.416
I merely expressed my point of view,
and Uncle Ricky did what was right.

01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:19.500
The park will get destroyed
and an ugly hotel will go in, is that it?

01:34:19.583 --> 01:34:22.416
Yes, because it'll help a lot of people.

01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:23.500
It'll help you.

01:34:24.791 --> 01:34:26.208
This is Green Park, Dad.

01:34:27.166 --> 01:34:29.833
I can't believe you don't care
about anything besides money?

01:34:29.916 --> 01:34:32.125
Excuse me, missy. Mind your step.

01:34:32.958 --> 01:34:35.333
You get to travel the world
with that money,

01:34:35.416 --> 01:34:37.208
go shopping, and your partying.

01:34:37.958 --> 01:34:41.250
Do you have any idea how much
that watch of your costs?

01:34:41.333 --> 01:34:43.750
Where do you think
the money for that comes from?

01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:49.000
For God's sake, Ronnie, grow up.

01:34:49.083 --> 01:34:51.083
At some point, you will inherit this all.

01:34:52.125 --> 01:34:55.541
Besides, this is business,
it's not personal.

01:34:56.208 --> 01:34:58.916
My friends hate me because of you.

01:34:59.708 --> 01:35:02.250
So I'm sorry, but it is personal.

01:35:03.916 --> 01:35:05.750
Then get new friends.

01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:24.833
Thank you for coming.

01:35:25.833 --> 01:35:26.958
What can I do for you?

01:35:27.041 --> 01:35:28.458
I want to say sorry.

01:35:28.541 --> 01:35:31.166
-Why is that?
-I made you upset.

01:35:32.333 --> 01:35:33.625
Why are you angry, Betts?

01:35:36.500 --> 01:35:38.875
I'm not angry, I'm just sad.

01:35:41.375 --> 01:35:43.166
Can you please tell me why?

01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:46.708
You're my oldest friend, Betts.

01:35:47.708 --> 01:35:50.666
It feels really strange
when you won't even talk to me like this.

01:35:59.791 --> 01:36:01.791
Can you please tell me what's wrong?

01:36:01.875 --> 01:36:04.041
Is this about me and Ronnie?

01:36:06.916 --> 01:36:09.666
The connection you have with
Ronnie is clearly special.

01:36:09.750 --> 01:36:12.125
I really shouldn't have
tried to get involved.

01:36:14.250 --> 01:36:16.875
Ronnie can't have
a special connection with anyone.

01:36:16.958 --> 01:36:18.833
-That's not true.
-I'm serious.

01:36:18.916 --> 01:36:20.625
She only cares about herself.

01:36:20.708 --> 01:36:21.625
Hey, enough!

01:36:21.708 --> 01:36:24.208
I know she may be spoiled,
but she has a big heart.

01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:28.708
Reggie can think whatever he wants.
I don't believe it.

01:36:29.458 --> 01:36:31.166
It's impossible that she had any idea.

01:36:31.250 --> 01:36:33.000
-Really?
-Yes.

01:36:33.083 --> 01:36:36.791
Green Park is as important to her
as the rest of us, Archie.

01:36:36.875 --> 01:36:39.875
Don't you remember,
her tenth birthday party happened here?

01:36:40.833 --> 01:36:44.416
How could I forget? It's the first time
we went on that giant wheel.

01:36:44.500 --> 01:36:46.791
And her favorite teacher?
Mrs. Pearson.

01:36:47.416 --> 01:36:49.666
And how much fun her class was.

01:36:49.750 --> 01:36:52.541
-Oh, really?
-Don't you remember?

01:36:53.250 --> 01:36:54.875
Here is your passport.

01:36:56.500 --> 01:36:58.541
Please be responsible with your money.

01:36:58.625 --> 01:37:01.083
Yes, Dad. I'll find a part-time job.
Don't worry.

01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:03.125
Pass exams first, okay?

01:37:03.750 --> 01:37:05.791
Hey, have you ever wanted
to leave Riverdale?

01:37:06.625 --> 01:37:08.000
I always wanted to stay.

01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:11.000
How are you and Uncle Ben
as different as you are?

01:37:13.833 --> 01:37:16.500
Your grandfather used to ask
the same question.

01:37:16.583 --> 01:37:18.875
-"The" Richard Andrews?
-Yes.

01:37:18.958 --> 01:37:20.083
"The" Richie.

01:37:22.083 --> 01:37:23.583
Oh, how he loved this country.

01:37:24.083 --> 01:37:28.000
He used to say,
"Every Englishman owes India."

01:37:28.916 --> 01:37:30.000
And he meant it.

01:37:30.708 --> 01:37:32.416
And when it was time to return,

01:37:33.541 --> 01:37:36.125
he stayed back, to give back.

01:37:37.291 --> 01:37:39.666
-The travel agency did that?
-Yes.

01:37:40.333 --> 01:37:43.458
He made his money off of those
who wanted to return,

01:37:44.375 --> 01:37:47.083
to give to those who had nothing.

01:37:48.416 --> 01:37:52.333
Juggy's mom said that Grandpa opened up
a school for the kids in her village.

01:37:52.416 --> 01:37:53.458
Yes.

01:37:54.333 --> 01:37:56.541
In fact, we still donate to that school.

01:37:56.625 --> 01:37:58.916
Really? I didn't know that.

01:38:00.166 --> 01:38:02.625
I was hoping
maybe you would do the same thing.

01:38:03.500 --> 01:38:07.208
But you think a bit more like
your Uncle Ben, huh? Huh?

01:38:07.291 --> 01:38:10.916
The grass is always greener
on the other side.

01:38:16.125 --> 01:38:17.375
Are you happy you stayed?

01:38:22.125 --> 01:38:23.541
This place is our home, Archie.

01:38:25.500 --> 01:38:26.666
We're a minority here.

01:38:27.583 --> 01:38:29.125
But this is our homeland.

01:38:32.166 --> 01:38:33.708
And if we all left this place…

01:38:35.708 --> 01:38:38.625
the Anglo-Indians,
who would even know about us?

01:38:40.916 --> 01:38:43.166
It would be like we never existed.

01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.666
Pat the mud down, Archie.

01:39:36.875 --> 01:39:37.875
Well done!

01:40:14.166 --> 01:40:17.666
Get two ice cream shakes
for the price of one!

01:40:18.125 --> 01:40:19.791
A chocolate milkshake, Pop.

01:40:21.375 --> 01:40:24.333
Double scoop of vanilla.
A cherry on top?

01:40:27.041 --> 01:40:29.500
Try our new exciting flavors.

01:40:50.208 --> 01:40:51.208
Dad.

01:40:51.291 --> 01:40:52.625
Hmm?

01:40:52.708 --> 01:40:54.208
I need to talk to you.

01:40:55.791 --> 01:40:57.250
I don't want to go to London.

01:40:59.208 --> 01:41:01.458
Why? What has happened?

01:41:01.541 --> 01:41:03.375
There could be a way to save Green Park,

01:41:03.458 --> 01:41:05.625
and I can't leave knowing
I could've done something.

01:41:05.708 --> 01:41:07.958
Okay, but all arrangements have been made.

01:41:08.041 --> 01:41:09.500
Can we rearrange it?

01:41:10.708 --> 01:41:11.708
Please, Fred.

01:41:14.125 --> 01:41:15.416
I learned today

01:41:16.583 --> 01:41:18.375
the grass isn't greener on the other side.

01:41:20.458 --> 01:41:22.458
The grass is greener where you water it.

01:41:24.041 --> 01:41:25.750
Isn't that what you meant?

01:41:28.333 --> 01:41:29.583
My home is here.

01:41:31.333 --> 01:41:32.333
I can't leave.

01:42:31.791 --> 01:42:35.000
Not interested. Please leave. Out.

01:43:12.583 --> 01:43:13.958
So it wasn't Ronnie?

01:43:15.625 --> 01:43:18.083
It was Dennis,
he's a reporter at the Gazette.

01:43:18.166 --> 01:43:20.458
Dad found out
he's on Uncle Hiram's payroll.

01:43:20.541 --> 01:43:22.333
You guys accused her for nothing.

01:43:22.958 --> 01:43:23.833
Yeah.

01:43:26.083 --> 01:43:27.583
Can we see Veronica?

01:43:27.666 --> 01:43:30.541
Miss Lodge is out
on a trip with her mother.

01:43:30.625 --> 01:43:33.333
Oh.
Please tell her we came to see her.

01:43:42.250 --> 01:43:43.500
Did you talk to Veronica, son?

01:43:54.541 --> 01:43:57.750
What do you mean?
You are not going to sign?

01:43:57.833 --> 01:43:59.083
Hiram Lodge got me the job.

01:43:59.166 --> 01:44:01.791
It wouldn't be gracious
to go against him, baby.

01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:50.041
-Merry Christmas, Nanny.
-Merry Christmas, Veronica baby.

01:44:50.125 --> 01:44:51.791
I hope you like your gift.

01:44:51.875 --> 01:44:53.458
-God bless you.
-Thank you.

01:44:53.541 --> 01:44:56.583
-Merry Christmas, Miss Lodge.
-Merry Christmas, Smithers.

01:44:56.666 --> 01:44:57.500
Where's Mama?

01:44:57.583 --> 01:45:00.666
Your parents left early this morning
to make it in time

01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:03.291
for the Governor's lunch in Missouri.

01:45:04.166 --> 01:45:05.208
Missouri?

01:45:05.291 --> 01:45:07.291
Mrs. Lodge asked you not to wait for them,

01:45:07.375 --> 01:45:10.208
and to go ahead and open your gifts.

01:45:11.625 --> 01:45:13.208
They'll be back soon.

01:45:17.375 --> 01:45:21.458
Would you like to invite
your friends over for lunch?

01:45:22.375 --> 01:45:23.666
We could cook up a storm.

01:45:50.666 --> 01:45:52.958
Looks delicious.
You've started making trifles, Betts?

01:45:53.041 --> 01:45:56.041
-No, my mom made it.
-Yummy. Thank you.

01:45:56.125 --> 01:45:57.125
Thank you.

01:45:58.541 --> 01:45:59.541
Ronnie!

01:46:24.708 --> 01:46:26.583
Your house looks so lovely.

01:46:27.541 --> 01:46:28.750
Merry Christmas, Ronnie.

01:46:28.833 --> 01:46:30.875
Merry Christmas, Uncle Hal.

01:46:30.958 --> 01:46:32.875
Ronnie's having lunch with us.

01:46:32.958 --> 01:46:34.375
How wonderful!

01:46:34.458 --> 01:46:36.500
But first your Christmas gift.

01:46:39.166 --> 01:46:40.916
-Welcome home.
-Thank you.

01:46:41.000 --> 01:46:43.791
Daddy, where's Ronnie's gift?
I can't find it.

01:46:43.875 --> 01:46:46.416
How blessed we are to have you, Veronica.

01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:47.666
Merry Christmas.

01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:48.875
My love.

01:46:50.458 --> 01:46:52.583
Some milk and cookies
till the table is set?

01:46:52.666 --> 01:46:54.416
We are 17 years old, Dad.

01:46:57.583 --> 01:46:58.583
Come.

01:47:01.916 --> 01:47:03.875
You are so lucky, Betts.

01:47:04.833 --> 01:47:05.958
So are you.

01:47:06.041 --> 01:47:08.375
We all get good and bad in our lunchbox.

01:47:09.958 --> 01:47:12.333
The boys are really ashamed
they doubted you.

01:47:12.416 --> 01:47:14.541
You could really help save the park.

01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:16.375
Thank you for believing me.

01:47:17.375 --> 01:47:18.625
For always and ever.

01:47:27.916 --> 01:47:30.541
Ronnie, I've got something to tell you.

01:47:34.916 --> 01:47:36.250
I kissed Archie.

01:47:37.583 --> 01:47:38.708
You did what?

01:47:38.791 --> 01:47:41.708
I'm sorry, Ron. I didn't think
you still had feelings for him.

01:47:42.625 --> 01:47:45.166
-When?
-My birthday night.

01:47:48.750 --> 01:47:51.333
I really thought, while you were gone

01:47:51.416 --> 01:47:53.125
that things had changed.

01:47:53.208 --> 01:47:55.791
And you said that
you weren't interested, so…

01:47:55.875 --> 01:47:57.083
Your birthday?

01:47:57.166 --> 01:47:58.291
Yeah.

01:47:58.375 --> 01:48:00.208
Why didn't you tell me, Betts?

01:48:00.291 --> 01:48:03.166
I felt guilty.
I'm sorry, it was just wrong.

01:48:04.875 --> 01:48:07.500
At the lake house,
when I saw you together,

01:48:07.583 --> 01:48:10.083
it was obvious you two are in love.

01:48:11.958 --> 01:48:14.333
Archie doesn't know the meaning of love.

01:48:16.291 --> 01:48:18.166
I'm sorry.
I should've told you earlier.

01:48:18.250 --> 01:48:21.166
Yeah, I mean, if you would have told me,

01:48:21.250 --> 01:48:23.000
then I wouldn't have kissed Archie.

01:48:24.791 --> 01:48:26.541
I wouldn't have come in the way.

01:48:40.708 --> 01:48:43.750
I always felt
like you had a crush on him.

01:48:44.625 --> 01:48:49.125
And sometimes I used to worry
that I'd lose him to you.

01:48:50.250 --> 01:48:52.916
-To me?
-You're the only girl I've ever envied.

01:48:54.166 --> 01:48:58.208
You're kind and generous and friendly.

01:48:58.291 --> 01:49:00.708
And everyone loves you, Betty Cooper.

01:49:02.041 --> 01:49:04.875
And you're as cute as a button.

01:49:06.541 --> 01:49:08.291
I've never felt that way.

01:49:08.375 --> 01:49:09.541
You should!

01:49:09.625 --> 01:49:12.291
Instead of focusing on
what a boy thinks of you.

01:49:13.708 --> 01:49:15.583
How dare he play us both!

01:49:15.666 --> 01:49:21.208
You think he's playing us both,
or is he actually just confused?

01:49:21.958 --> 01:49:24.750
There's only one weirdo
who can answer that.

01:49:25.583 --> 01:49:27.208
Archie? Two-time?

01:49:28.166 --> 01:49:29.416
Why would I know that?

01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:31.333
Because you know him
better than anyone else.

01:49:31.416 --> 01:49:32.375
Who told you that?

01:49:32.458 --> 01:49:34.791
I did. Now spit it out.
What's his game here?

01:49:37.208 --> 01:49:39.166
I… I have to go collect petitions.

01:49:39.250 --> 01:49:42.541
-I'm getting late, I have to go.
-Sit down!

01:49:44.208 --> 01:49:47.250
-And put your hands behind your back.
-Why?

01:49:50.166 --> 01:49:53.041
What the hell?
Are you guys policewomen or something?

01:49:53.125 --> 01:49:55.291
Those are my mother's.

01:50:00.333 --> 01:50:01.666
Are you going to murder me?

01:50:01.750 --> 01:50:03.041
Maybe.

01:50:15.375 --> 01:50:16.541
Wait, what's going on?

01:50:18.208 --> 01:50:20.083
What's on the menu, Smithers?

01:50:20.791 --> 01:50:22.833
Goat trotters with bread.

01:50:22.916 --> 01:50:24.708
Boar curry and rice.

01:50:24.791 --> 01:50:25.666
Chicken liver pie.

01:50:26.458 --> 01:50:27.583
Roast quail.

01:50:27.666 --> 01:50:29.333
Meat and potatoes.

01:50:29.416 --> 01:50:32.791
And Master Jughead's favorite,
pork vindaloo.

01:50:34.333 --> 01:50:35.583
Thank you, Smithers.

01:50:39.333 --> 01:50:43.583
Now tell Betty and me the truth
or watch us eat dinner.

01:50:43.666 --> 01:50:45.416
Archie loves you both.

01:50:45.500 --> 01:50:47.500
He's really confused and can't decide.

01:50:47.583 --> 01:50:49.000
Who is he to decide?

01:50:49.083 --> 01:50:50.875
No, no, you're absolutely right.

01:50:50.958 --> 01:50:52.083
He messed with us, Juggy.

01:50:52.166 --> 01:50:55.000
I warned Archie when you'll find out,
it'll be bad.

01:50:55.083 --> 01:50:58.083
But he wouldn't listen.
You girls are scary.

01:50:58.166 --> 01:50:59.791
-Scary?
-Yeah.

01:51:00.625 --> 01:51:02.083
-Poor guy.
-Poor guy?

01:51:02.166 --> 01:51:05.166
Huh? It's a real problem.
He can't help himself.

01:51:05.250 --> 01:51:06.791
He can't live without either of you.

01:51:06.875 --> 01:51:09.333
That's why he wrote
both of you that Founders' Ball song.

01:51:09.416 --> 01:51:10.291
-What?
-What?

01:51:14.041 --> 01:51:15.875
Can I join you for dinner now?

01:51:24.375 --> 01:51:25.416
Archie.

01:51:26.875 --> 01:51:28.166
Mm…

01:51:28.250 --> 01:51:29.750
You're having a dream.

01:51:38.416 --> 01:51:40.750
And here is your nightmare.

01:51:43.875 --> 01:51:45.083
Ronnie?

01:51:45.166 --> 01:51:47.041
The last time I checked, yes.

01:51:48.125 --> 01:51:50.666
-I owe you a big apology.
-Yes, you do.

01:51:50.750 --> 01:51:52.958
I should've known
you were telling the truth.

01:51:53.041 --> 01:51:55.458
And we should've known
you're a world-class liar.

01:51:55.541 --> 01:51:57.666
Betty, what's going on?

01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:59.000
You tell us.

01:51:59.083 --> 01:52:02.416
And why are you creating problems
between us, Archiekins?

01:52:02.500 --> 01:52:03.708
"Problems"?

01:52:07.458 --> 01:52:09.750
I know what this looks like,
but I've never lied.

01:52:09.833 --> 01:52:11.208
I've always been honest.

01:52:11.291 --> 01:52:13.875
Like the time that you
wrote me that song?

01:52:13.958 --> 01:52:15.708
"Va Va Voom" was for Betty,

01:52:15.791 --> 01:52:17.416
or maybe me?

01:52:18.958 --> 01:52:19.958
Jughead told you?

01:52:21.875 --> 01:52:23.250
-True friend.
-What?

01:52:23.791 --> 01:52:26.916
-Why would you do that?
-I don't know, I really like both of you.

01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:28.166
That's so sweet.

01:52:28.250 --> 01:52:30.958
I'm really sorry.
I don't want to hurt either of you.

01:52:31.041 --> 01:52:33.666
Great. 'Cause we don't want to hurt
each other either.

01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:36.291
Betts and I won't let
anyone split us up.

01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:38.541
It's just not worth it.

01:52:38.625 --> 01:52:40.083
You saying I'm not worth it?

01:52:40.166 --> 01:52:41.458
Sort of.

01:52:41.541 --> 01:52:43.208
We're one big gang, Arch.

01:52:43.291 --> 01:52:45.250
And you're the most perfect
best friend, too.

01:52:46.166 --> 01:52:48.416
We should keep it at that.
Don't you think?

01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:50.208
Better for everyone.

01:52:50.291 --> 01:52:54.000
-Don't look so heartbroken.
-He'll be fine.

01:52:54.625 --> 01:52:56.166
"Hearts don't break," right?

01:52:56.250 --> 01:52:57.583
"They just fracture."

01:52:58.166 --> 01:52:59.750
And "Time heals everything"?

01:52:59.833 --> 01:53:00.833
Yeah.

01:53:01.416 --> 01:53:03.083
Use different lines, Archiekins!

01:53:03.166 --> 01:53:04.208
Bye.

01:53:04.291 --> 01:53:07.250
Oh, and don't try this again.
Or else we'll kill you.

01:53:07.333 --> 01:53:09.541
See you
at the park meeting tomorrow.

01:53:09.625 --> 01:53:11.500
You just got popped, Andrews.

01:53:18.416 --> 01:53:19.708
Here you go. Here.

01:53:27.666 --> 01:53:30.000
-Hi, Ronnie.
-Hi.

01:53:30.083 --> 01:53:31.833
-Hi.
-Welcome back.

01:53:35.041 --> 01:53:36.041
Hey.

01:53:38.625 --> 01:53:40.166
I'm sorry.

01:53:41.083 --> 01:53:43.375
And I'm Ronnie.
Nice to meet you.

01:53:45.208 --> 01:53:46.666
We came to visit.

01:53:46.750 --> 01:53:47.583
Hi.

01:53:47.666 --> 01:53:48.708
Betts.

01:53:49.625 --> 01:53:51.458
Thanks for sparing his life.

01:53:51.541 --> 01:53:52.875
Don't be weird, Juggy.

01:53:53.416 --> 01:53:55.875
You have done more than enough, Jughead.

01:53:55.958 --> 01:53:57.791
True friend!

01:53:59.083 --> 01:54:00.000
Come, sit.

01:54:00.083 --> 01:54:02.333
So, how's it going?

01:54:03.125 --> 01:54:05.333
Final count, 1200 signatures.

01:54:06.916 --> 01:54:08.458
We're still 3300 short.

01:54:08.541 --> 01:54:12.250
-That's it. We're out of time.
-She's right.

01:54:12.333 --> 01:54:13.625
My mother told me that

01:54:13.708 --> 01:54:16.500
on Monday, at the park,
the work will start.

01:54:16.583 --> 01:54:18.500
That means
we only have 4 days left.

01:54:18.583 --> 01:54:20.833
That's not even half
the number we needed.

01:54:20.916 --> 01:54:23.958
We should go door to door.
Get every adult signature we can.

01:54:24.041 --> 01:54:26.708
I mean, we have to do something.
We can't give up.

01:54:26.791 --> 01:54:28.916
I… I may have an idea.

01:54:29.625 --> 01:54:30.916
There are two types of adults.

01:54:31.000 --> 01:54:32.958
Young adults
and the ones trying to be young.

01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:36.916
I think we can draw them in.

01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:38.375
-Meaning?
-Meaning we should

01:54:38.458 --> 01:54:40.000
invite all the adults to one place.

01:54:40.083 --> 01:54:42.041
You know what? We can have a fest.

01:54:42.125 --> 01:54:44.000
-I love fests.
-Yes!

01:54:44.083 --> 01:54:45.375
Should we do it at the park?

01:54:45.458 --> 01:54:47.250
How do we invite everyone?

01:54:47.333 --> 01:54:50.416
We'll have the same problem
of not reaching enough people.

01:54:57.625 --> 01:54:59.041
Edison once said,

01:54:59.125 --> 01:55:01.083
"The successful person is one who

01:55:01.166 --> 01:55:04.708
even after 1000 failures,
he still gives it a try, once more."

01:55:04.791 --> 01:55:10.000
And did Edison also say how we can get
thousands of people to hear our message?

01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:13.875
Yeah, he did. The radio.

01:55:14.541 --> 01:55:17.750
-Edison invented the radio.
-No, that was Marconi. But who cares!

01:55:17.833 --> 01:55:19.416
Let's use the radio.

01:55:19.500 --> 01:55:21.791
-Moose, you're a genius!
-Thanks.

01:55:22.541 --> 01:55:24.000
Where are you going?

01:55:24.916 --> 01:55:27.458
But who's going to let us on Akashvani?

01:55:27.541 --> 01:55:29.166
Who said anything about Akashvani?

01:55:29.958 --> 01:55:31.500
We can try Dilton-vani.

01:55:31.583 --> 01:55:32.583
Come!

01:55:33.583 --> 01:55:36.416
-What is "Dilton-vani"?
-Let's go.

01:55:38.625 --> 01:55:41.375
Now we just have to see
if it actually works.

01:55:41.958 --> 01:55:43.541
You made a radio?

01:55:43.625 --> 01:55:45.416
Is this for real?

01:55:45.500 --> 01:55:47.833
Oh, it's a radio.

01:55:47.916 --> 01:55:50.625
You only told Moose about it?

01:55:51.625 --> 01:55:52.625
Duh.

01:55:52.708 --> 01:55:53.791
This is legal, right?

01:55:54.583 --> 01:55:55.708
Mm-mm.

01:55:55.791 --> 01:55:59.083
Come on, Hedy Lamarr.
Show us your stuff.

01:56:03.041 --> 01:56:04.000
Whoa.

01:56:04.083 --> 01:56:05.083
Dilly!

01:56:13.625 --> 01:56:17.416
Godrej Cinthol Soap.
India's only deodorant soap.

01:56:20.375 --> 01:56:23.625
Good morning, Riverdale!
I am here as your Secret Santa.

01:56:23.708 --> 01:56:26.375
I'm aware I'm a little late,
but you know what they say,

01:56:26.458 --> 01:56:28.750
"Better to be Mr. Late
than a late mister."

01:56:30.791 --> 01:56:31.833
No, but seriously, folks.

01:56:31.916 --> 01:56:34.416
I am sure that by now
you're all aware

01:56:34.500 --> 01:56:36.291
that Green Park's future
is in jeopardy.

01:56:36.375 --> 01:56:38.166
But some kids just won't have it.

01:56:38.250 --> 01:56:41.458
With us here now is 17-year-old
Archie Andrews of Riverdale High.

01:56:41.541 --> 01:56:43.291
Archie, what did you wish to say?

01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:50.750
Hello, everybody.
I'm Class of 1964.

01:56:50.833 --> 01:56:54.291
And what I'd like to say is
just talking about it isn't going to help.

01:56:54.375 --> 01:56:58.041
The time has come for us
to come together as one and take action.

01:56:58.125 --> 01:57:02.416
So, Archie, as you said,
everyone must unite and take action.

01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:04.291
Tell us where do we meet up?

01:57:04.875 --> 01:57:05.875
Green Park.

01:57:06.916 --> 01:57:08.250
"You're officially invited

01:57:08.333 --> 01:57:11.958
to the jammiest of jam sessions
on the sunniest of Sundays on the 30th."

01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:19.958
"Music, food, games, love,
and most importantly, free entry!"

01:57:20.041 --> 01:57:24.458
"But all kids must each be
accompanied by an adult."

01:57:24.541 --> 01:57:27.916
We only have four days left. And then,
construction begins in the park.

01:57:28.000 --> 01:57:31.208
These trees are the story
of our past generations.

01:57:31.291 --> 01:57:34.000
If we forget our story,
then who are we?

01:57:34.583 --> 01:57:38.666
You need to protect our park,
for yours and your children's futures.

01:57:39.458 --> 01:57:41.083
Be there if you care!

01:57:46.291 --> 01:57:47.250
Well done!

01:57:48.250 --> 01:57:49.458
Dilly, you genius.

01:57:49.541 --> 01:57:50.583
Thank you!

01:57:50.666 --> 01:57:52.833
Thank you!

02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:07.625
Unlock the park gates
now or you will be in trouble.

02:00:07.708 --> 02:00:11.625
I said open up the gates.
Don't just stand there, come on.

02:00:12.750 --> 02:00:14.666
You don't want to go to jail, do you?

02:00:14.750 --> 02:00:17.916
If you all don't get up,
I'm going to put all of you in jail.

02:00:18.958 --> 02:00:19.958
Let's go.

02:00:27.333 --> 02:00:29.458
How did they know
we'd be here a day early?

02:00:29.541 --> 02:00:33.000
Good call, Miss Lodge,
making us spend the night.

02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:37.166
Evacuate the premises!
This is a Council order.

02:00:37.250 --> 02:00:38.500
Let the games begin.

02:00:39.958 --> 02:00:41.500
Save the green!

02:00:41.583 --> 02:00:43.083
Save the green!

02:00:43.166 --> 02:00:47.208
Save the green! Save the green!
Save the green!

02:00:47.291 --> 02:00:48.541
No, quiet down.

02:00:48.625 --> 02:00:50.958
-Save the green!
-This needs to stop.

02:00:51.041 --> 02:00:52.333
Save the green!

02:00:52.416 --> 02:00:54.791
Hey, quiet down! Silence!

02:00:54.875 --> 02:00:57.666
Save the green! Save the green!

02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:58.750
Silence!

02:00:58.833 --> 02:01:01.916
Save the green! Save the green!

02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.083
-This is public property!
-Save the green!

02:01:04.166 --> 02:01:09.125
Open the gates now and evacuate
the premises, in five minutes.

02:01:09.208 --> 02:01:11.833
This is a Council order.

02:01:11.916 --> 02:01:13.875
Excuse me! Please!

02:01:13.958 --> 02:01:15.833
Excuse me. Thank you.

02:01:15.916 --> 02:01:18.500
-Save the green! Save the green!
-Excuse me.

02:01:18.583 --> 02:01:21.625
Save the green! Save the green!

02:01:21.708 --> 02:01:23.708
Save the green! Save the green!

02:01:23.791 --> 02:01:25.125
For crying out loud!

02:01:25.791 --> 02:01:27.958
You let her stay out here all night?

02:01:28.041 --> 02:01:30.250
Have you ever tried to stop her, Hiram?

02:01:31.208 --> 02:01:33.041
She's your daughter, after all.

02:01:34.125 --> 02:01:38.708
Save the green! Save the green!

02:01:38.791 --> 02:01:40.541
Mrs. Lodge.

02:01:40.625 --> 02:01:41.458
Mr. Lodge.

02:01:42.125 --> 02:01:43.625
Sorry for these nuisance kids.

02:01:43.708 --> 02:01:45.583
I will order the police
to force them all out.

02:01:45.666 --> 02:01:47.291
You will do no such thing.

02:01:48.083 --> 02:01:50.708
But they will collect petitions,
Mrs. Lodge.

02:01:50.791 --> 02:01:53.416
What will happen if they hit the target?

02:01:53.500 --> 02:01:55.416
Then I will lose the land
and you your donation.

02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:56.833
Precisely!

02:01:56.916 --> 02:01:58.375
Back off, Dawson.

02:01:58.458 --> 02:02:02.666
Nothing will happen.
They'll never collect enough signatures.

02:02:02.750 --> 02:02:05.958
-Save the green! Save the green!
-Let them have their day.

02:02:06.041 --> 02:02:11.833
Save the green! Save the green!

02:02:11.916 --> 02:02:16.333
Save the green! Save the green!

02:02:24.250 --> 02:02:26.291
Anything in exchange for signatures!

02:02:26.375 --> 02:02:27.750
Four signatures per burger.

02:02:27.833 --> 02:02:30.708
Yeah, all you want is a soda?
That is just one signature.

02:02:32.208 --> 02:02:33.958
Two signatures for that, sir.

02:02:34.041 --> 02:02:35.083
Come on!

02:02:38.458 --> 02:02:42.541
Wonderful! Okay. Who's next?
Three tries for three signatures.

02:02:42.625 --> 02:02:45.666
Come, light up the bulb!
Let's see how strong you are.

02:02:45.750 --> 02:02:47.166
It's your lucky day.

02:02:48.875 --> 02:02:52.625
Every item is marked.
That's five signatures, that's eight.

02:02:52.708 --> 02:02:54.708
-And that's ten.
-Ten?

02:02:54.791 --> 02:02:57.333
You want more style?
Get more signatures.

02:02:57.416 --> 02:02:58.875
-Go, go!
-Mom!

02:02:58.958 --> 02:03:01.750
Who wants a makeover?
Cut your hair. Or style your hair.

02:03:01.833 --> 02:03:04.375
Spin the wheel and get a new look
for five signatures!

02:03:04.458 --> 02:03:05.666
You look great!

02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:07.666
-Looking good, Aunty Alice!
-Thank you, Ethel.

02:03:07.750 --> 02:03:10.125
One signature for a cookie,
two for a brownie,

02:03:10.208 --> 02:03:12.250
and three signatures
for a slice of cake.

02:03:12.333 --> 02:03:14.875
-How is it going, my Betts? Yeah?
-Good.

02:03:16.083 --> 02:03:18.708
This is comfort food
in your comfort place.

02:03:18.791 --> 02:03:20.208
Would you like some cake?

02:03:28.166 --> 02:03:29.625
Wow! So strong!

02:03:30.458 --> 02:03:32.583
Sign the petition.
Ask a question.

02:03:33.250 --> 02:03:34.625
Get a punchline.

02:03:36.291 --> 02:03:38.041
Why are horses so strong?

02:03:39.250 --> 02:03:42.250
Because they live in
a stable environment!

02:03:44.250 --> 02:03:45.291
Knock-knock.

02:03:49.583 --> 02:03:50.625
Who's there?

02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:52.416
Yam.

02:03:54.541 --> 02:03:55.541
Yam who?

02:03:56.333 --> 02:03:57.791
Yeah, I am very, very sorry.

02:04:03.541 --> 02:04:04.916
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:06.916
please give this corny joke some love.

02:04:11.375 --> 02:04:12.791
Mango orchard? Mary will show you.

02:04:12.875 --> 02:04:14.416
This way to the mango orchid.

02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:15.875
The mango orchard, everyone. Yeah?

02:04:15.958 --> 02:04:17.625
-Mary is right there.
-The mango orchard.

02:04:17.708 --> 02:04:19.916
We have to get
as many petitions as possible.

02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:21.666
I'm so proud of you guys.

02:04:23.291 --> 02:04:26.375
How many times do I have to tell you
these books don't sell?

02:04:26.458 --> 02:04:27.625
Put them in the back room.

02:04:45.708 --> 02:04:46.791
You're an hour late.

02:04:47.791 --> 02:04:48.875
Sorry about that.

02:04:48.958 --> 02:04:50.958
We'll keep bringing you more
as they come in.

02:04:51.041 --> 02:04:52.208
You have till 5:00 p.m.

02:04:53.000 --> 02:04:54.666
Please count them carefully.

02:04:55.750 --> 02:04:57.500
Not a single signature will be missed.

02:04:58.250 --> 02:04:59.291
Thank you.

02:05:05.791 --> 02:05:07.625
Hello, everybody.

02:05:07.708 --> 02:05:10.125
Thank you so much for coming here today.

02:05:10.208 --> 02:05:12.875
You've seen the Archies perform before.

02:05:12.958 --> 02:05:16.250
But today we have some new band members.

02:05:17.333 --> 02:05:19.916
Friends who inspired the song,
we're gonna sing for you today.

02:05:20.541 --> 02:05:23.791
So let's meet them.
We have Dilton Doiley.

02:05:25.333 --> 02:05:26.833
Reggie Mantle.

02:05:28.208 --> 02:05:29.583
Veronica Lodge.

02:05:30.208 --> 02:05:31.166
Betty Cooper.

02:05:32.833 --> 02:05:34.000
Ethel Muggs.

02:05:34.583 --> 02:05:35.791
Moose Mason.

02:05:35.875 --> 02:05:37.208
And Midge Klump.

02:05:37.750 --> 02:05:39.708
So, let's hear it for the Archies!

02:05:43.583 --> 02:05:47.791
My father once told me to make art
one has to go in, not out.

02:05:48.333 --> 02:05:51.000
And so this song comes from our hearts.

02:05:52.750 --> 02:05:56.083
If, like us, you happen to want
this park to stay protected,

02:05:56.625 --> 02:05:59.125
it's absolutely critical
the petition goes through.

02:05:59.791 --> 02:06:01.041
Ladies and gentlemen,

02:06:01.125 --> 02:06:03.416
I believe we can save this park.

02:06:03.500 --> 02:06:05.166
-Yes, we can!
-Go on!

02:06:05.250 --> 02:06:07.166
I believe we can save the green!

02:06:07.250 --> 02:06:08.375
-Yes!
-Yes!

02:11:47.958 --> 02:11:51.208
Like I said,
some things are worth fighting for.

02:11:53.458 --> 02:11:56.750
The next day was New Year's Eve.
It was a cold morning.

02:11:57.458 --> 02:12:00.583
We were all waiting
for the results of the vote.

02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:04.875
Mr. Gomes went personally to the Gazette
office to deliver the voting results.

02:12:11.000 --> 02:12:13.833
The next stop
was Station Master Doiley's house.

02:12:13.916 --> 02:12:15.041
Dilly.

02:12:15.125 --> 02:12:17.666
Dilton's illegal radio had to be seized.

02:12:17.750 --> 02:12:19.958
But he was allowed one final announcement.

02:12:20.041 --> 02:12:23.958
We have received the total numbers
for Green Park's petition…

02:12:24.041 --> 02:12:27.875
Dilly flipped on the mic and everyone
raised the volume of their radios.

02:12:27.958 --> 02:12:31.583
And Dilton-vani was heard
in every home in town.

02:12:31.666 --> 02:12:34.625
The message was loud and clear,
just like the citizens of Riverdale.

02:12:34.708 --> 02:12:39.833
The town has been louder and clearer
than we could've ever imagined.

02:12:39.916 --> 02:12:43.375
"Save the green"
got 5600 signatures!

02:12:43.458 --> 02:12:46.583
And no one was gonna cut down our trees.

02:12:46.666 --> 02:12:48.458
Our history would remain untouched.

02:12:48.541 --> 02:12:50.500
The tradition
of Planters' Day would live on.

02:12:50.583 --> 02:12:53.416
The permission to build the hotel
was revoked.

02:12:53.500 --> 02:12:56.583
As they say,
you win some and you lose some.

02:12:56.666 --> 02:13:01.750
And guess what? Our class of '64
became Riverdale's most famous students.

02:13:01.833 --> 02:13:02.958
Moose!

02:13:04.291 --> 02:13:06.791
-What is "revoke"?
-I'll tell you later.

02:13:06.875 --> 02:13:08.625
Aunty Alice and Uncle Hal recognized

02:13:08.708 --> 02:13:11.958
that what they should've done,
the children did instead.

02:13:12.041 --> 02:13:13.500
You cheeky kids.

02:13:13.583 --> 02:13:15.125
They did what we couldn't.

02:13:15.208 --> 02:13:17.041
The park will be there to see another day.

02:13:17.125 --> 02:13:19.083
Dad! Congrats!
You finally got it!

02:13:19.166 --> 02:13:21.791
Fred's Hindi
also improved miraculously.

02:13:21.875 --> 02:13:25.541
And like every successful man,
Mr. Lodge rolled with the punches.

02:13:25.625 --> 02:13:29.416
He saw himself in Veronica,
and found his victory in her success.

02:13:29.500 --> 02:13:32.833
You have demonstrated that
no one is too young to change the world.

02:13:33.583 --> 02:13:34.666
Well played, kiddos!

02:13:35.958 --> 02:13:37.125
Thank you.

02:13:37.208 --> 02:13:40.333
Pop Tate announced
free meals for everyone that day.

02:13:40.958 --> 02:13:43.083
Come, I'll tell you what "revoke" is.

02:13:44.041 --> 02:13:47.208
And Mr. Dawson could hardly finish
his breakfast

02:13:47.291 --> 02:13:50.458
before everyone except him
was out celebrating.

02:13:50.541 --> 02:13:53.416
It was going to be a very happy new year,

02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.958
because the Archies had done it!
