WEBVTT

00:03.421 --> 00:06.674
Damn, it feels good
to have the old
boardwalk back.

00:06.674 --> 00:08.092
This place is awesome.

00:08.092 --> 00:11.303
I used to
dominate this place
as a teenager.

00:11.303 --> 00:13.889
"Queen of the Boardwalk,"
I used to call me.

00:13.889 --> 00:16.767
You know, these places
are terrible for the
coastal environment.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.562
Plus, the last two boardwalks

00:19.562 --> 00:20.896
literally washed away.

00:20.896 --> 00:22.565
Just seems like
a big waste of money.

00:22.565 --> 00:25.985
And besides, all these boards
are a major splinter hazard

00:25.985 --> 00:27.737
for people, like me,

00:27.737 --> 00:30.239
who exclusively wear
open-toed shoes,

00:30.239 --> 00:32.241
a historically
marginalized group.

00:32.241 --> 00:35.578
Whoa, check out
that guy's package
jiggling like crazy.

00:38.581 --> 00:40.583
- Oh, yeah!

00:42.418 --> 00:45.171
Um, welcome to the boardwalk.

00:47.089 --> 00:50.092
<i>♪ Good morning, USA ♪</i>

00:50.092 --> 00:53.763
The Langley boardwalk's back,
featuring many old favorites,

00:53.763 --> 00:55.306
like the Octocoaster

00:55.306 --> 00:56.932
and Fudge-mania.

00:56.932 --> 00:59.101
But also many new favorites.

00:59.101 --> 01:01.020
Like a second
Fudge-mania location

01:01.020 --> 01:02.605
and Skimboardo's,

01:02.605 --> 01:05.691
the exclusive new
restaurant on the pier.

01:05.691 --> 01:08.778
Let's go now to
the new boardwalk's
confident architect.

01:08.778 --> 01:12.573
Thank you for coming
to what I can say,
without a doubt,

01:12.573 --> 01:14.492
is Langley Falls'

01:14.492 --> 01:18.454
sturdiest boardwalk ever!

01:20.456 --> 01:21.707
And to make certain,

01:21.707 --> 01:23.459
we drove the support beams

01:23.459 --> 01:26.587
two miles down into
the Earth's core.

01:26.587 --> 01:29.715
This baby ain't going nowhere.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.759
Seems a little excessive.
Not to mention

01:31.759 --> 01:34.386
- the mole people that
must've been displaced.
- Shh!

01:34.386 --> 01:36.639
And now, to hit

01:36.639 --> 01:39.141
the ceremonial final spike,

01:39.141 --> 01:40.810
opening us for business,

01:40.810 --> 01:42.561
wrestling superstar,

01:42.561 --> 01:44.313
and my personal friend,

01:44.313 --> 01:46.732
Bret "the Hitman" Hart.

01:55.241 --> 01:57.743
- What was that rumble?
- Oh, I don't know, Hayley.

01:57.743 --> 01:59.912
Maybe just
<i>Pro Wrestling Illustrated's</i>

01:59.912 --> 02:03.123
most hated wrestler of 1997

02:03.123 --> 02:06.210
kicking off the best
goddamned summer ever.

02:07.545 --> 02:08.879
I'll catch up with
you guys later.

02:08.879 --> 02:10.339
I'm gonna hit up
some Skee-Ball.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.466
Back in the day, I was nasty.

02:12.466 --> 02:15.678
Anyway, I want to
see if the old man's
still got his touch.

02:15.678 --> 02:17.221
Give me that, bitch.

02:17.221 --> 02:19.306
We've got to get
to Skimboardo's ASAP

02:19.306 --> 02:21.517
- if we want to
get a table.
- Rude.

02:21.517 --> 02:24.520
- So, what are you--
- I'm gonna go apply
for my dream job.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.689
Working at
the salt water
taffy store.

02:26.689 --> 02:29.191
Huh. I had no idea
that was your dream job.

02:29.191 --> 02:31.569
Did you know taffy
was my favorite food?

02:31.569 --> 02:32.820
No.

02:32.820 --> 02:34.446
And did you know stores

02:34.446 --> 02:36.782
are my favorite places
that sell things?

02:36.782 --> 02:39.869
I... I never... No, I guess.

02:39.869 --> 02:41.871
Then I understand
your confusion.

02:41.871 --> 02:43.455
Bye.

02:43.455 --> 02:45.207
Actually, maybe I did know

02:45.207 --> 02:48.043
stores are
his favorite places
that sell things.

02:48.043 --> 02:50.170
Anyway, I'm gonna get
some Dippin' Dots.

02:50.170 --> 02:51.672
I'll find you when I'm done.

02:53.340 --> 02:54.466
Ugh...

02:54.466 --> 02:57.303
Of course I pick today
to forget my Bow Biters.

02:57.303 --> 02:59.430
I'm gonna be tying
these puppies all day.

02:59.430 --> 03:01.223
Hey, pal. Are you gonna
be here for a second?

03:01.223 --> 03:02.808
Do you mind keeping
an eye on my kid?

03:02.808 --> 03:05.477
- I was actually just
tying my shoes.
- Great. Thanks.

03:06.645 --> 03:09.481
Yo.

03:09.481 --> 03:13.027
Made a sick itinerary
of my old faves.

03:13.027 --> 03:15.070
Only playing the hits today.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.906
A full henna sleeve,

03:16.906 --> 03:19.575
loitering outside
the boogie board shop.

03:19.575 --> 03:22.828
And I think I'll start
with some boardwalk pizza.

03:22.828 --> 03:23.954
Okay. See ya.

03:23.954 --> 03:25.915
Oh, maybe I'll hang with you.

03:25.915 --> 03:28.375
Ooh, I don't know.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.128
I kind of wanted
today to be fun.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.464
Wha... What? I'm fun.

03:33.464 --> 03:36.133
Girl, have you
heard yourself
this morning?

03:36.133 --> 03:38.510
You're always
looking for problems.

03:38.510 --> 03:41.221
And I've been waiting
20 years for this.

03:41.221 --> 03:44.141
Today, I'm Team
Good Vibes only.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.976
Come on, Mom.
Give me a chance.

03:45.976 --> 03:47.853
I'll be positive. I promise.

03:47.853 --> 03:52.733
Oh, yeah? I've been thinking
about getting into fracking.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.611
Oh... tight.

03:56.612 --> 03:59.990
And, oh, boy,
was my dad screaming.

03:59.990 --> 04:02.076
But my jaw had
locked by that point,

04:02.076 --> 04:04.453
so I couldn't have let go
even if I wanted to.

04:04.453 --> 04:07.498
Enough. That story was fine
for walking, but we're here.

04:07.498 --> 04:10.167
This place is buzzing.
But I've got a plan.

04:10.167 --> 04:13.295
We're gonna tell them
we're dining here on business.

04:13.295 --> 04:15.506
Oh-ho-ho. Genius.

04:15.506 --> 04:17.383
Business is so important.

04:17.383 --> 04:19.259
They'll have to respect that.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.803
Hi. Hello.

04:20.803 --> 04:24.556
My colleague and I
would like to dine
here on business.

04:24.556 --> 04:26.350
Well, we're all
booked up for months,

04:26.350 --> 04:29.144
but you're welcome to
sit at the bar and see
if anything opens up.

04:29.144 --> 04:30.604
Oh.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.481
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

04:32.481 --> 04:33.899
I hear what you're saying.

04:33.899 --> 04:37.444
And what's the status
on that table a-now?

04:37.444 --> 04:39.405
The status is we're
completely booked.

04:39.405 --> 04:41.448
But you're welcome
to wait at the bar.

04:43.075 --> 04:44.910
What the hell? The bar?

04:44.910 --> 04:47.621
What? Is the piss-soaked
bathroom floor already full?

04:47.621 --> 04:49.039
Well, we can't leave now.

04:49.039 --> 04:51.000
We're already a hundo in.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.336
Fine. But I won't be showing
any bartenders my balls.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.588
This restaurant has
lost that privilege.

04:57.881 --> 05:00.342
- Still unstoppable.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.011
This must be
how Tom Brady felt

05:02.011 --> 05:04.263
when he read the script
for <i>80 for Brady.</i>

05:08.684 --> 05:11.937
Whoa, that ties
my all-time best.

05:13.188 --> 05:14.356
What the--

05:14.356 --> 05:16.400
Someone really got 850?

05:23.824 --> 05:25.659
You're fine, Stan.
You're the best.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.037
Just slowly extract
that little worm soul

05:28.037 --> 05:30.039
with these nine
balls made of--

05:30.039 --> 05:31.248
What even is this?

05:31.248 --> 05:32.708
It's brown like wood,

05:32.708 --> 05:35.169
but it's, like,
heavy and light
at the same time.

05:35.169 --> 05:36.670
Hey, what are
these balls made of?

05:36.670 --> 05:38.005
- Masonite.
- Masonite.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.506
That's great news.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.091
What the hell is Masonite?

05:43.469 --> 05:44.970
Your dad's been gone a while.

05:45.971 --> 05:47.431
I'm Steve. What's your name?

05:47.431 --> 05:49.725
- Noah.
- Cool.

05:49.725 --> 05:52.603
Like Noah's Ark. Classic tale.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.646
Very cool.

05:54.646 --> 05:57.274
- So, what are you
into these days?
- Purple.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.734
Hmm. Yep.

05:58.734 --> 06:00.778
Can I tell you a secret?

06:00.778 --> 06:03.113
Of course.
But full disclosure.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.282
I do tell my friend
Snot everything.

06:06.492 --> 06:07.493
Poop.

06:11.121 --> 06:12.956
Snot will actually love that.

06:14.833 --> 06:17.211
I'm here to apply
for my dream job.

06:17.211 --> 06:19.379
Well, you're in luck.
We're short-staffed,

06:19.379 --> 06:21.048
and you seem like a great guy.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.341
Can you start right now?

06:22.341 --> 06:24.468
You bet I can.

06:24.468 --> 06:27.429
Mm, beautiful,
isn't she?
But listen.

06:27.429 --> 06:30.641
You're gonna want
to touch it.
Don't do it.

06:30.641 --> 06:36.355
<i>♪ Even though
it's so beautiful ♪</i>

06:36.355 --> 06:37.523
Come on!

06:39.441 --> 06:40.484
Here we go.

06:40.484 --> 06:42.611
A great apron for a great man.

06:43.862 --> 06:47.116
Damn. Couldn't have
happened to a better guy.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.787
You've got to learn
to fold it with one hand

06:51.787 --> 06:53.789
so you can hold
your 40 in the other.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.252
Mm.

06:58.252 --> 07:00.295
That was lucky.
Your pizza was
on the ground

07:00.295 --> 07:02.673
and no seagulls
tried to grab it.

07:02.673 --> 07:04.466
There actually
aren't any seagulls.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.218
That's... that's
kind of weird, right?

07:06.218 --> 07:08.220
Jesus, Hayley.

07:08.220 --> 07:11.306
You really can't help
but look for problems,
can you?

07:11.306 --> 07:13.767
No seagulls is a good thing.

07:13.767 --> 07:17.479
Look. I can toss my pizza
on the ground, walk away,

07:18.856 --> 07:20.023
walk back,

07:20.023 --> 07:22.151
and it's still there, untouched.

07:25.195 --> 07:28.115
A birdless boardwalk
is the dream.

07:28.115 --> 07:30.492
Just accept something
good is happening.

07:30.492 --> 07:32.369
Mm. Come on.

07:32.369 --> 07:33.662
Toss your pizza.

07:33.662 --> 07:35.414
See how good it feels.

07:35.414 --> 07:38.250
Or can you not handle
Team Good Vibes?

07:38.250 --> 07:39.376
'Course I can.

07:39.376 --> 07:41.086
Does this answer
your question?

07:44.840 --> 07:45.883
- Oh.
- Wow.

07:45.883 --> 07:46.967
Bad.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.094
Nuh-uh! I can still eat it.

07:49.094 --> 07:50.762
I like it sandy-style.

07:53.182 --> 07:55.267
Did you see all those
rats running inland?

07:55.267 --> 07:58.187
Well, yeah. And the seabirds
have clearly figured it out.

07:58.187 --> 08:00.397
- They're all gone.
- Animals are smart.

08:00.397 --> 08:02.065
They knew before we did.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.859
A tsunami is coming.

08:05.360 --> 08:08.155
I wonder where
all them birds
went, anyway.

08:10.365 --> 08:14.119
It'd be foolish
not to carbo-load
before my big hike.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.873
You got this, Al.

08:17.873 --> 08:20.167
Don't panic. Don't panic.

08:21.668 --> 08:23.337
Panic!

08:29.551 --> 08:31.094
Sorry. Excuse me.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.179
Hi.

08:33.430 --> 08:35.724
Did you just say
a tsunami is coming?

08:35.724 --> 08:38.310
No. I haven't said
a word in three hours.

08:38.310 --> 08:40.562
There we go.
I'm back in the game.

08:40.562 --> 08:42.898
Apparently, when we put
those extra deep,

08:42.898 --> 08:46.610
extra safe pilings
two miles into the ground,

08:46.610 --> 08:48.445
<i>we accidentally
hit a fault line.</i>

08:48.445 --> 08:50.280
<i>That line runs out
under the ocean,</i>

08:50.280 --> 08:52.074
<i>where it triggered
an earthquake,</i>

08:52.074 --> 08:55.285
<i>creating a tidal wave
that's heading right at us.</i>

08:55.285 --> 08:56.703
Great, great.

08:56.703 --> 08:59.164
And, um, I shouldn't
be losing my shit
because...

08:59.164 --> 09:00.999
This would only be a big deal

09:00.999 --> 09:03.543
if it wasn't totally
under control.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.963
I've assembled the beach's
hottest lifeguards,

09:05.963 --> 09:09.049
and we're finalizing a plan
to defuse the wave right now.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.676
So don't go telling everybody.

09:10.676 --> 09:12.427
It'll just create a panic.

09:12.427 --> 09:13.637
A needless panic,

09:13.637 --> 09:17.641
because everything's
gonna be totally fine.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.726
Totally fine, you say?

09:19.726 --> 09:21.520
Totally fine.

09:23.272 --> 09:24.773
Oh, hey, Mom.

09:24.773 --> 09:26.525
I'm loving this vibe.

09:26.525 --> 09:28.944
But, um, can I talk
to you about something
I just saw real quick?

09:28.944 --> 09:32.322
This sounds like
boardwalk gossip.
Great vibes.

09:32.322 --> 09:35.951
Hayley, thanks for
making such an effort
to be cool today.

09:35.951 --> 09:37.327
I appreciate it.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.955
Anyway, what's the board goss?

09:39.955 --> 09:43.375
<i>Everything's gonna
be totally fine.</i>

09:43.375 --> 09:45.252
<i>Totally fine, you say?</i>

09:45.252 --> 09:47.129
<i>Totally fine.</i>

09:47.129 --> 09:49.131
<i>All right. I'm taking
your word for it.</i>

09:49.131 --> 09:51.216
<i>I don't want to ruin
this moment with my mom.</i>

09:51.216 --> 09:53.468
<i>Wait. You didn't say
that last part before.</i>

09:53.468 --> 09:55.429
<i>Yeah. We're working
through some recent stuff.</i>

09:55.429 --> 09:56.513
<i>Gotcha.</i>

09:56.513 --> 09:57.597
Come on!

09:57.597 --> 09:59.349
<i>I actually gotta go. Bye.</i>

10:00.434 --> 10:02.019
Give me the goss.

10:02.019 --> 10:03.145
The gossip?

10:03.145 --> 10:06.481
Um, I, uh, just saw...

10:06.481 --> 10:08.275
a bunch of hot lifeguards.

10:08.275 --> 10:09.359
Oh, my God.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.320
That is good gossip.

10:11.320 --> 10:16.491
Lifeguards are so hot.

10:16.491 --> 10:19.286
Welcome to Team
Good Vibes, Hayley.

10:22.247 --> 10:23.623
I gave her 100 bucks.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.125
How are we stuck at the bar?

10:25.125 --> 10:26.752
I want my four Jagerbombs

10:26.752 --> 10:28.420
sitting in a
regular-sized chair

10:28.420 --> 10:29.963
directly across from you.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.048
Like a gentleman.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.507
That's messed up, man.

10:32.507 --> 10:33.884
Memphis, you're famous.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.969
Go demand a table
and bring us with you.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.596
I'm sorry. I don't eat.

10:37.596 --> 10:39.139
- Use your celebrity.
- No.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.517
You're
boning us, dude.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.394
Whoa. These drinks
are not cheap.

10:45.604 --> 10:47.189
Oh, forgot my credit card.

10:47.189 --> 10:49.441
- How much cash
you got on you?
<i>- Nada,</i> dog.

10:49.441 --> 10:50.859
I figured you'd cover this

10:50.859 --> 10:53.153
since I paid for
the Sonicare head
we both share.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.322
Hi there. Loving the bar.

10:55.322 --> 10:56.698
Beautiful space.

10:56.698 --> 10:59.242
Hey, can we
get a partial refund
on that bribe?

10:59.242 --> 11:01.828
But we definitely do
still want the next table.

11:05.999 --> 11:08.835
Roger, grab the tablecloth
and put it over the podium.

11:08.835 --> 11:10.379
We can eat here.

11:10.379 --> 11:13.382
I wouldn't call any of them
my girlfriend, per se,

11:13.382 --> 11:16.718
but... but all high potential
situations, you know.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.553
Um, does that
answer your question?

11:21.556 --> 11:23.517
Are you hungry?
We can't go far,

11:23.517 --> 11:25.560
but there's a nacho
stand right there.

11:25.560 --> 11:26.937
No way.

11:26.937 --> 11:30.607
My friend Tommy
said nachos are
too spicy for me.

11:30.607 --> 11:32.442
And now I'm scared
to try them.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.277
Aw, buddy, you'll be fine.

11:34.277 --> 11:35.737
Don't listen to Tommy.

11:35.737 --> 11:37.656
Everyone knows he's
a [bleep] sucking

11:37.656 --> 11:40.033
mother [bleep] dip
stinky pants.

11:41.576 --> 11:44.287
I'll even
take the first bite
just to make sure.

11:44.287 --> 11:47.124
Hmm... Okay.

11:47.124 --> 11:48.417
Attaboy.

11:50.085 --> 11:51.795
I may also grab a pretzel.

11:51.795 --> 11:54.923
Or has Tommy been running
his mouth about those too?

11:54.923 --> 11:56.967
Noah? Noah?

11:56.967 --> 11:58.260
Noah?

11:58.260 --> 12:00.137
Noah!

12:00.846 --> 12:02.889
Oh, thank God.

12:02.889 --> 12:03.974
There you are.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.435
Never do that to me again!

12:07.686 --> 12:09.479
I'm sorry. You just scared me.

12:10.689 --> 12:11.690
Oh, thank God.

12:14.818 --> 12:16.486
How am I getting worse?

12:16.486 --> 12:17.904
I'm never gonna catch him.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.156
I got to do something.

12:20.115 --> 12:21.158
Of course.

12:25.745 --> 12:27.539
Well, looks like you win.

12:27.539 --> 12:29.291
Just wanted to say congra--

12:29.291 --> 12:30.417
What's this?

12:31.585 --> 12:32.794
Oh, my God.

12:32.794 --> 12:35.130
Look what just fell out
of this kid's pocket.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.882
Schematics for 9/11.

12:36.882 --> 12:38.842
This kid helped plan 9/11.

12:38.842 --> 12:41.386
Uh, I wasn't alive for 9/11.

12:41.386 --> 12:43.263
You don't need to call
the cops or anything.

12:43.263 --> 12:44.681
I believe in second chances.

12:44.681 --> 12:47.476
But you do need
to disqualify
all his scores.

12:47.476 --> 12:49.060
Sir, before I do anything,

12:49.060 --> 12:51.771
you're gonna have to
explain to me what 9/11 is.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.982
We're crushing
this day, Hayles.

12:53.982 --> 12:56.067
After this, we'll head
down to the beach,

12:56.067 --> 12:57.986
blast some Eminem real loud,

12:57.986 --> 12:59.362
and smoke salvia

12:59.362 --> 13:02.240
right next to a family
with a bunch of little kids.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.577
Yeah. Sounds, um, perfect.

13:07.704 --> 13:11.249
I, um, just remembered
I left my can of dip

13:11.249 --> 13:13.710
on the back
of the crapper.
Be right back.

13:15.420 --> 13:16.421
Oh, good.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.381
You actually do have a plan.

13:18.381 --> 13:19.799
We have the tightest plan.

13:19.799 --> 13:21.343
These backpacks have dynamite

13:21.343 --> 13:23.512
left over from the
boardwalk construction.

13:23.512 --> 13:27.557
We're gonna cruise out,
drop it, and trigger
a retaliatory wave,

13:27.557 --> 13:30.936
resulting in zero net waves.

13:30.936 --> 13:32.562
Tsunami neutralized.

13:32.562 --> 13:35.857
And I'll be
smoking these dudes
at mini golf by sunset.

13:35.857 --> 13:39.528
I'm, uh, not sure
that's how water works.

13:39.528 --> 13:40.779
Well, this is the plan,

13:40.779 --> 13:42.322
and we only got time for one.

13:42.322 --> 13:44.658
So how about some
good vibes, lady?

13:44.658 --> 13:45.825
It'll work.

13:45.825 --> 13:47.077
Watch for yourself.

13:47.077 --> 13:49.287
Hot lifeguards, mount up!

13:50.413 --> 13:51.957
Everyone got your red things?

13:51.957 --> 13:54.376
- All right. Let's go.

14:10.183 --> 14:12.143
Help. Throw me your red thing.

14:14.521 --> 14:17.190
- Good catch.
- Wrong red thing!

14:30.870 --> 14:32.080
We're all screwed.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.292
Hey. Do I have
kettle corn
in my teeth?

14:37.794 --> 14:38.920
Sweet. Thanks.

14:42.340 --> 14:43.508
Just to be clear,

14:43.508 --> 14:44.968
you're gonna airbrush this

14:44.968 --> 14:47.220
so I have a big old
fat ass, right?

14:47.220 --> 14:48.305
Mom.

14:48.305 --> 14:49.931
What's with the face?

14:49.931 --> 14:52.392
I thought you were
being positive today.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.769
Oh, I'm positive.
Real positive.

14:54.769 --> 14:56.313
That we're all [bleep].

14:56.313 --> 14:59.316
The entire boardwalk's about
to get wiped out by a tsunami.

14:59.316 --> 15:01.901
You see
that huge-ass wave,
Team Good Vibes?

15:04.821 --> 15:06.114
Dear God.

15:06.823 --> 15:08.241
Run!

15:08.241 --> 15:10.035
Hey. You need to
pay for these.

15:10.035 --> 15:12.579
This is why we should
get the money up front.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.624
I can't believe you got
assistant manager over me.

15:15.624 --> 15:18.585
Boss.
I didn't see you there.

15:18.585 --> 15:21.546
- Run for your lives!

15:21.546 --> 15:24.466
Tsunami!

15:24.466 --> 15:26.885
Ladies,
you can relax.

15:26.885 --> 15:29.137
We can relax
because we were wrong
about the tsunami?

15:29.137 --> 15:30.305
No, no, no, no.

15:30.305 --> 15:31.765
One's definitely coming.

15:31.765 --> 15:34.809
The super low tide
is a dead giveaway.

15:34.809 --> 15:39.022
You can relax because
when the warning signs
are this obvious,

15:39.022 --> 15:40.523
it's too late to get away.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.942
There's no outrunning
it at this point.

15:44.319 --> 15:45.570
My advice?

15:45.570 --> 15:47.697
Use what little
time you have left

15:47.697 --> 15:50.825
saying goodbye to
the ones you love.

15:50.825 --> 15:53.244
Am I one of those people?

15:59.584 --> 16:01.419
Honey, we have horrible news.

16:01.419 --> 16:04.798
Ha! The day I've had,
you don't even know
what horrible news is.

16:04.798 --> 16:06.925
A tsunami is about
to take out the boardwalk,

16:06.925 --> 16:08.510
and it's too late to get away.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.178
We're goners.

16:10.178 --> 16:13.431
That'll short out
these machines, right?
Wipe out all the scores?

16:13.431 --> 16:15.934
Yeah. I mean, it'll wipe out

16:15.934 --> 16:18.269
everything and everyone
on this boardwalk.

16:18.269 --> 16:19.562
Including that kid.

16:19.562 --> 16:21.731
And we'd all die tied at zero.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.650
If it's God's will,
it's God's will.

16:23.650 --> 16:24.984
Who am I to question it?

16:27.487 --> 16:29.698
See you in purgatory,
bitch ass.

16:33.368 --> 16:34.536
And we're all doomed.

16:34.536 --> 16:36.287
This isn't fair.

16:36.287 --> 16:38.498
We should have
so much more
time together.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.500
I know, sweetie.

16:40.500 --> 16:43.002
It's not supposed
to happen this way.

16:43.002 --> 16:45.422
You're supposed to outlive me,

16:45.422 --> 16:48.591
and sing
<i>Candle in the Wind</i>
at my funeral.

16:48.591 --> 16:50.385
You're not
going out like this.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.139
This is my will.

16:54.139 --> 16:56.015
Give it to whoever finds you.

16:56.015 --> 16:59.269
You get it all, son.

16:59.269 --> 17:02.272
Raising you today has been
the greatest honor of my life.

17:07.318 --> 17:08.695
I'm sorry.

17:08.695 --> 17:11.197
I never should
have attacked you
for being negative

17:11.197 --> 17:14.033
or asked you
not to be yourself.

17:14.033 --> 17:17.203
Turns out
you have pretty good
survival instincts.

17:17.203 --> 17:18.580
Thanks, Mom.

17:18.580 --> 17:21.624
It's just, my time
on the boardwalk
20 years ago

17:21.624 --> 17:24.252
was the best
weekend of my life.

17:24.252 --> 17:27.797
Wait. This was all
based on one weekend?

17:27.797 --> 17:31.593
Geez. Sorry I didn't
live at the beach.
I'm not a starfish.

17:31.593 --> 17:35.555
Anyway, maybe I need
to be more selective
in calling out problems,

17:35.555 --> 17:37.098
but they do come along,

17:37.098 --> 17:40.185
and if you don't see them,
you can't find solutions.

17:40.185 --> 17:42.979
And we've got a big problem.

17:42.979 --> 17:45.231
And zero solutions.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.567
- Babe? What happened?

17:47.567 --> 17:48.985
Actually, we don't have time.

17:48.985 --> 17:50.904
Tell me later when
we're drowning to death.

17:52.614 --> 17:54.699
Wow. This taffy won't budge.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.918
This stuff's strong.

18:07.921 --> 18:10.089
Problem. Solution.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.008
Keep pulling.
We're gonna
stretch this

18:12.008 --> 18:15.053
all the way down the boardwalk
and make a delicious barrier.

18:16.137 --> 18:18.056
This will take forever.

18:18.056 --> 18:21.142
Need a hand from
<i>Pro Wrestling Illustrated's</i>

18:21.142 --> 18:24.312
most inspirational
wrestler of 1994?

18:34.697 --> 18:36.658
Check out all
those empty tables.

18:36.658 --> 18:39.828
Finally, we catch
a break. Shall we?

18:40.954 --> 18:44.290
Ah. The promised land.

18:44.290 --> 18:47.252
- I feel so important.
- I'm sorry.

18:47.252 --> 18:49.796
We're actually gonna
be needing that table.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.130
What? Everyone left.

18:51.130 --> 18:53.174
And this place is
about to be driftwood.

18:53.174 --> 18:56.636
Yeah, but we're
expecting a big group
between now and then.

18:56.636 --> 19:00.890
So you're welcome
to keep waiting at the bar
or run for your lives.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.976
Oh, you'd just love that,
wouldn't you?

19:02.976 --> 19:04.769
You've been trying
to shake us all day,

19:04.769 --> 19:07.480
but you must have us
confused for some suckers.

19:07.480 --> 19:10.275
So we'll be waiting
out the incoming
tsunami at the bar.

19:10.275 --> 19:11.901
Thank you very much.

19:11.901 --> 19:14.863
And we will be
checking back in with you
if either of us survive.

19:17.824 --> 19:18.825
I know you don't

19:18.825 --> 19:21.035
want to hear this right now,

19:21.035 --> 19:22.745
but I did bring my wallet.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.962
How sure are you
this thing will
actually work, Hayley?

19:30.962 --> 19:33.840
Not at all.
But how about some
good vibes, Mom?

19:51.232 --> 19:53.109
- It worked!
- Hallelujah!

19:53.109 --> 19:54.986
Oh, no. My Skee-Ball problem.

19:54.986 --> 19:57.030
Saving hundreds of lives?

19:57.030 --> 19:58.448
Great vibes, Hayles.

19:58.448 --> 19:59.532
Thanks, Mom.

20:01.242 --> 20:03.578
Noah, my baby. There you are.

20:03.578 --> 20:05.330
Thanks for keeping
an eye on him.

20:05.330 --> 20:07.624
His dad forgot
he had softball
this afternoon.

20:07.624 --> 20:09.834
High school softball.
He watches it.

20:09.834 --> 20:11.836
What a day we had, Noah.

20:11.836 --> 20:14.422
But it's time to go
back to your family.

20:14.422 --> 20:16.466
I'll always cherish
our time together.

20:16.466 --> 20:18.468
Hey, creep.
Stay away
from my kid.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.930
You'll always be
in my heart, Noah.

20:21.930 --> 20:23.681
Let's get the hell
out of here.

20:25.892 --> 20:27.143
What about Jeff?

20:27.143 --> 20:29.187
Eh,
seagulls are back.
They're on it.
