<i>This is the Persian empire...</i>

00:40.249 --> 00:42.377
<i>...known today as Iran.</i>

00:43.293 --> 00:47.343
<i>For 2500 years, this land was ruled
by a series of kings...</i>

00:47.506 --> 00:49.053
<i>...known as shahs.</i>

00:50.300 --> 00:54.726
<i>In 1950, the people of Iran elected
Mohammad Mosaddegh...</i>

00:54.888 --> 00:57.266
<i>...a secular democrat, as prime minister.</i>

00:58.517 --> 01:01.691
<i>He nationalized British and U.S.
petroleum holdings...</i>

01:01.853 --> 01:04.822
<i>...returning Iran's oil to its people.</i>

01:05.983 --> 01:07.781
<i>But in 1953...</i>

01:07.943 --> 01:12.574
<i>...the U.S. and Great Britain engineered
a coup d'état that deposed Mosaddegh...</i>

01:12.739 --> 01:15.743
<i>...and installed Reza Pahlavi as shah.</i>

01:17.035 --> 01:20.505
<i>The young shah was known
for opulence and excess.</i>

01:20.831 --> 01:23.550
<i>His wife was rumored to bathe in milk...</i>

01:23.709 --> 01:27.634
<i>...while the shah had his lunches
flown in by Concorde from Paris.</i>

01:29.089 --> 01:30.466
<i>The people starved.</i>

01:33.093 --> 01:35.972
<i>The shah kept power through his ruthless
internal police:</i>

01:36.638 --> 01:37.890
<i>The SAVAK.</i>

01:38.390 --> 01:41.644
<i>An era of torture and fear began.</i>

01:43.937 --> 01:47.316
<i>He then began a campaign
to westernize Iran...</i>

01:48.317 --> 01:52.117
<i>...enraging a mostly traditional Shiite
population.</i>

01:52.779 --> 01:57.080
<i>In 1979, the people of Iran
overthrew the shah.</i>

01:59.036 --> 02:03.212
<i>The exiled cleric, Ayatollah Khomeini,
returned to rule Iran.</i>

02:06.418 --> 02:11.174
<i>It descended into score-settling,
death squads and chaos.</i>

02:14.426 --> 02:18.147
<i>Dying of cancer,
the shah was given asylum in the U. S.</i>

02:20.057 --> 02:23.732
<i>The Iranian people took to the streets
outside the U.S. embassy...</i>

02:23.894 --> 02:26.488
<i>...demanding that the shah be returned...</i>

02:26.647 --> 02:27.990
<i>...tried...</i>

02:28.899 --> 02:30.276
<i>...and hanged.</i>

02:30.442 --> 02:34.288
Based on a true story.

02:34.446 --> 02:38.326
U.S. Embassy, Iran - November 4, 1979

03:39.511 --> 03:42.481
The carnival's a little bigger today, huh?

03:44.015 --> 03:46.939
Windows are supposed to be
bulletproof, right?

03:47.102 --> 03:49.150
Well, they've never been tested.

03:49.354 --> 03:53.780
You just need to finish
filling out this section here.

03:53.942 --> 03:55.740
We can process your visa.

04:45.577 --> 04:49.127
We need some security.
Yes, it's your responsibility.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.506
They're over the walls.

04:50.665 --> 04:53.418
We should all split.
I'm gonna close up my office.

05:13.313 --> 05:14.405
Oh, my God.

05:15.357 --> 05:17.530
Marines to Number One. Fall back.

05:17.692 --> 05:21.196
- Can anyone hear me? We need help.
- I need police right now. Right now, goddamn it!

05:21.363 --> 05:23.036
- Jesus.
- Can anybody hear me?

05:23.198 --> 05:25.041
There was a breach.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.873
Just burn everything! Burn it now!

05:28.036 --> 05:30.789
All right, burn everything!
All the files, file cabinet, safe.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.852
Let's get a cart over here. Burn it all.
Come on.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.893
Burn everything!
Burn the classifieds! Everything!

05:55.355 --> 05:57.107
<i>Don't fucking shoot anybody.</i>

05:57.274 --> 05:59.993
<i>You don't wanna be the son of a bitch
who started a war.</i>

06:00.151 --> 06:01.949
<i>They need an hour to burn the classified.</i>

06:02.946 --> 06:03.993
I need you to hold.

06:04.155 --> 06:08.205
If you shoot one person, they're gonna kill
every single one of us in here.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.096
I'm telling you,
if we're going to go, we need to go now.

06:20.255 --> 06:23.850
- Okay, we need to make a decision...
- Can we wait until the Iranian police come?

06:24.009 --> 06:26.478
No, the police aren't coming.
It's been 45 minutes.

06:26.636 --> 06:29.640
- How do you know?
- The police have abandoned their posts.

06:29.806 --> 06:32.150
If the police are not coming,
then the army's gonna come.

06:32.309 --> 06:34.653
The prime minister won't let
the embassy be taken over.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.855
The prime minister may
come tomorrow, but the

06:36.881 --> 06:39.012
Komiteh are here today.
So we have to evacuate.

06:39.149 --> 06:41.243
Look at me. No one is coming.

06:42.694 --> 06:45.447
Get the desk drawers. Everything.
Don't sort it.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.958
Get it down to the incinerator
in the vault! Go, now!

06:48.116 --> 06:50.039
Tear gas as a last resort only.

06:50.201 --> 06:52.545
<i>I repeat: only
if your life is under threat.</i>

07:30.325 --> 07:33.124
In here, we are in America right now.
Outside, we are in Iran.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.846
- It's on American soil...
- I'm not going out into that.

07:35.956 --> 07:37.208
They're not safe here.

07:37.374 --> 07:40.344
If they get caught applying for visas
to the U.S.?

07:40.502 --> 07:43.426
Mark, we are in the only building
with direct access to the street.

07:43.588 --> 07:46.341
- If we're going to go, then we need to go now.
- Yeah, I'm in.

07:46.508 --> 07:47.930
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's go.

07:53.014 --> 07:55.062
- I'm going outside.
- Why?

07:55.225 --> 07:56.693
To reason with them.

08:23.086 --> 08:26.431
Open the door!

08:26.589 --> 08:28.307
Open the fucking door!

08:30.176 --> 08:33.020
You said you wanted to see the world,
right, Tom?

08:33.179 --> 08:35.273
Let me in! Let me in!

08:43.231 --> 08:44.733
Burn it all. Come on.

08:44.899 --> 08:47.652
Get the safe, get the filing cabinets,
get it all.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.583
All four drawers,
I want them shredded right now.

08:57.746 --> 08:59.544
Not gonna shred fast enough.

08:59.789 --> 09:02.258
Grab the visa plates!

09:03.043 --> 09:05.887
All four! And anything else
you see out there.

09:06.087 --> 09:07.839
When in doubt, just shred it!

09:10.341 --> 09:12.969
We got 10 minutes!
Let's go, let's go, let's go! Everything!

09:22.479 --> 09:23.526
Get the shredder.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.235
There are no police.

09:31.863 --> 09:33.080
Jesus.

09:34.115 --> 09:37.039
Leave the building, go now.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.296
Iranians go first.

09:39.454 --> 09:41.081
Now, hurry!

09:51.091 --> 09:56.518
Who has made this?!

10:02.811 --> 10:04.484
It's done. They're in.

10:29.879 --> 10:33.133
Okay, come on.
We gotta get off the streets.

10:33.299 --> 10:34.846
This way. Up here to the left.

11:05.373 --> 11:06.543
- These fucks hit us, we can't hit them back?
- Mosaddegh, we did it to them first.

11:06.544 --> 11:07.307
These fucks hit us,
we can't hit them back?

11:07.333 --> 11:08.733
Mosaddegh, we did it to them first.

11:08.880 --> 11:11.970
You think the Soviets would put up with this shit?
They'd invade. STATE DEPARTMENT - 7TH FLOOR

11:11.971 --> 11:12.304
You think the Soviets would put up
with this shit? They'd invade.

11:12.463 --> 11:15.057
We helped the guy torture
and de-ball an entire population.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.435
- How many were there?
- At least 50. We're not sure.

11:17.594 --> 11:19.642
- Schafer!
- You still haven't found Schafer?

11:19.804 --> 11:21.965
No, I was screaming his name
because I was fucking him.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.228
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, TEHRAN

11:24.229 --> 11:26.390
Come in.
CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, TEHRAN

11:26.978 --> 11:27.069
<i>It's confirmed, sir. Six escaped.</i>

11:27.228 --> 11:29.401
<i>- I was told five.</i>
<i>- No, sir, apparently it's six.</i>

11:29.564 --> 11:29.778
- What happened?
- Not clear. We know they escaped.

11:29.779 --> 11:33.059
What happened? -Not clear. We know they escaped.
SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE

11:33.071 --> 11:33.736
Where are they? -The
Canadian ambassador's house.

11:33.737 --> 11:35.237
- Where are they?
- The Canadian ambassador’s house.

11:35.403 --> 11:39.124
- Do they stay put? Are we attempting rescue?
- Hold for the Secretary of State.

11:39.282 --> 11:41.080
Yes. ls White House joining?

11:41.242 --> 11:42.835
They claim the embassy
was a den of espionage.

11:42.994 --> 11:43.584
We wish it was.

11:43.585 --> 11:44.452
We wish it was.

11:44.624 --> 11:46.134
CI's got three people over
there, they don't see a

11:46.160 --> 11:48.321
revolution coming?
WHITE HOUSE, CHIEF OF STAFF'S OFFICE

11:48.625 --> 11:50.298
- Call it something other than intelligence.
- Hold for the chief of staff.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.087
- Hodding.
- I'll call him back.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.381
They're sticking.
No release till we expel the shah.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.596
- Put him on a plane, then. Fuck him.
- He's half-dead and he's in chemo.

11:57.759 --> 11:59.181
We took him in. He's ours now.

11:59.344 --> 12:01.813
Great, so we'll take in any prick
as long as he's got cancer?

12:01.971 --> 12:03.532
No, just the pricks on our side.

12:03.681 --> 12:07.231
So all our other pricks on their prick thrones
know when they get thrown out on a rail...

12:07.393 --> 12:10.567
...they won't get their fucking spleens
taken out by some camel vet in Sinai.

12:10.730 --> 12:13.233
What about the six
who are with the Canadians?

12:13.650 --> 12:16.278
We've got 60 in the embassy with guns
to their heads right now.

12:16.444 --> 12:19.243
The whole world is watching the embassy.
They're safer than the six on the street.

12:19.405 --> 12:21.578
Banisadr's saying it'll be over
in 24 hours.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.664
We leave the six where they are.
I'll go brief the president.

12:30.959 --> 12:32.085
All right, let's get to it.

12:32.252 --> 12:35.756
<i>So far official comments about the
incident have been a model of restraint.</i>

12:44.555 --> 12:48.901
69 DAYS LATER

13:01.572 --> 13:04.451
<i>Iran's Revolutionary Guard
has rounded up a gang of terrorists...</i>

13:04.617 --> 13:09.123
<i>...blamed for one murder of a half-dozen
followers of Ayatollah Khomeini.</i>

13:09.289 --> 13:13.044
<i>It says security at Khomeini's home
now has been tightened.</i>

13:13.209 --> 13:17.885
<i>This, by the way, is the 69th day that the
American hostages have been held in Tehran.</i>

13:18.047 --> 13:20.127
<i>There is no change reported
in the hostage situation.</i>

13:21.718 --> 13:25.063
<i>In this country, George Meany died
last night. He was 85 years old.</i>

13:27.098 --> 13:28.520
Yeah.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.194
Yes.

13:33.646 --> 13:34.647
What?

13:34.981 --> 13:36.824
<i>To begin with, of course...</i>

13:36.983 --> 13:40.658
<i>...we wanted to learn about the hostages
held in the American embassy compound.</i>

13:40.820 --> 13:44.199
<i>They may not understand what
their ordeal means to their countrymen.</i>

13:44.365 --> 13:46.663
<i>But this nation, their nation, is outraged.</i>

13:47.368 --> 13:47.457
<i>And we cannot really know what it is like
inside the prison that was once our embassy.</i>

13:47.458 --> 13:49.817
<i>And we cannot really know what
it is like inside the prison</i>

13:49.843 --> 13:52.084
<i>that was once our embassy.</i>
C.I.A. HEADQUARTERS, VIRGINIA

13:52.707 --> 13:56.928
<i>Actions of Iran
have shocked the civilized world.</i>

13:57.420 --> 13:59.889
<i>Our embassy has been seized...</i>

14:00.048 --> 14:05.054
<i>...and more than 60 American citizens
continue to be held as hostages.</i>

14:05.219 --> 14:09.224
<i>The situation in Iran this morning
is unchanged in regard to the hostages.</i>

14:09.390 --> 14:12.610
<i>NBC's situation in Iran has changed,
however.</i>

14:16.439 --> 14:19.363
- Is he back there?
- Office.

14:23.738 --> 14:25.285
What happened?

14:25.656 --> 14:28.250
The six of them went out a back exit.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.912
Brits turned them away,
Kiwis turned them away.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.797
Canadians took them in.

14:32.955 --> 14:35.003
Traffic calls them "The Houseguests."

14:35.166 --> 14:38.295
They haven't left the Canadian
ambassador's house since it happened.

14:38.461 --> 14:40.680
- Why didn't we get them 10 weeks ago?
- Too dangerous.

14:40.838 --> 14:44.308
You got Revolutionary Guards going
door-to-door like Jehovah's Witnesses.

14:44.467 --> 14:47.767
Half of them think that Khomeini's been
too lenient on the ones in the embassy.

14:47.929 --> 14:49.397
What about the White House?

14:49.555 --> 14:52.183
Carter's shitting enough bricks
to build the pyramids.

14:52.350 --> 14:53.397
The Canadians are done.

14:53.559 --> 14:55.377
They say they're bearing
too much risk. Their

14:55.403 --> 14:57.259
foreign secretary corners
Vance in Brussels...

14:57.397 --> 14:59.946
...and told him she wants
the six of them out.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.657
- Who else knows?
- Just the families.

15:02.819 --> 15:05.538
Meanwhile, some genius in our embassy
was keeping a mug book...

15:05.696 --> 15:08.575
...on everybody who worked there.
- Jesus Christ.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.914
We think it got shredded
before they got in.

15:11.077 --> 15:15.127
But now the bastards are using sweatshop
kids to reassemble the shreds.

15:15.289 --> 15:19.010
And once they reassemble that book
they'll know six Americans got out.

15:19.168 --> 15:20.761
And they'll know what they look like.

15:20.920 --> 15:23.298
Standing room only
for beheadings in the square.

15:23.464 --> 15:27.059
- Who's handling?
- State is coordinating in-house.

15:27.885 --> 15:29.353
State?

15:29.929 --> 15:31.806
- They don't do exfils.
- They do now.

15:31.973 --> 15:34.442
They want to run it by us,
strictly as consultants.

15:34.600 --> 15:36.648
Engell says it's a lose-lose.

15:36.811 --> 15:40.532
These people die, they die badly. Publicly.

15:40.690 --> 15:42.692
State wants the blame,
we'll give it to them.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.494
What does he want me here for?

15:45.653 --> 15:48.452
So he can tell State
he ran it by his best exfil guy.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.464
Okay.

15:56.664 --> 15:59.383
This is Bob Pender from State O.S.

15:59.542 --> 16:01.419
He's been talking to Morgan at ExtAff.

16:01.586 --> 16:03.964
- Bob?
- Thank you.

16:04.380 --> 16:05.802
All right.

16:06.132 --> 16:07.850
Mark and Cora Lijek.

16:08.009 --> 16:11.434
<i>Twenty-nine and 25. He's</i> a <i>consular
officer, she's an assistant.</i>

16:11.762 --> 16:15.016
<i>Newlyweds. They only just got there
a couple months ago.</i>

16:15.766 --> 16:19.316
No language skills or in-country knowledge.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.858
Henry Lee Schatz.
Agricultural attaché from Idaho.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.822
<i>A bit of an oddball, apparently.</i>

16:24.984 --> 16:28.204
<i>He was there to sell
U.S. tractors to Iranian agro.</i>

16:28.654 --> 16:30.952
Joe Stafford. Late 20s.

16:31.115 --> 16:32.992
<i>He's smart and a climber.</i>

16:33.159 --> 16:34.251
<i>Speaks Farsi.</i>

16:34.410 --> 16:37.254
<i>He arranged the hire of his wife, Kathy.</i>

16:37.413 --> 16:40.713
Embassy was understaffed,
so the faculty wives were the typing pool.

16:40.875 --> 16:43.424
And Bob Anders. Senior consular officer...

16:43.586 --> 16:46.180
<i>...oldest of the group
and most likely to be group leader.</i>

16:46.339 --> 16:49.218
They're in hiding at the Canadian
ambassador's residence.

16:49.383 --> 16:53.183
Fortunately, we do not believe the Iranians
are aware the six have escaped.

16:53.346 --> 16:57.442
So, what we like for this are bicycles.

16:58.226 --> 17:01.230
We've identified back roads
from the Shemiran district.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.739
A couple of rat lines
through the mountains...

17:03.898 --> 17:05.194
...to the crossing near Tabriz.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.237
Cars are off the table
because of the roadblocks.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.949
We wait till the weather clears up...

17:10.112 --> 17:13.491
...then deliver the six bikes, provide them
with maps to the Turkish border.

17:13.657 --> 17:16.286
We have intelligence
they can ride bicycles.

17:16.452 --> 17:19.422
Or we're prepared to send in
somebody to teach them.

17:26.921 --> 17:30.425
Or you could just send in training wheels
and meet them at the border with Gatorade.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.059
Tony.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.220
It's 300 miles to the Turkish border.

17:34.387 --> 17:36.810
They'd need a support team
following them with a tire pump.

17:36.973 --> 17:39.351
We were just asked to sharpshoot this.

17:39.517 --> 17:40.894
State is handling the op.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.312
I'm sorry, who is this?

17:42.728 --> 17:46.904
Tony's an exfil spesh. He got a lot
of the shah's people out after the fall.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.660
Sir, if these people can read or add...

17:49.819 --> 17:52.868
...pretty soon they're gonna figure out
they're six short of a full deck.

17:53.030 --> 17:55.073
It's winter. You can't
afford to wait around till

17:55.099 --> 17:57.060
spring so it's nice enough
to take a bike ride.

17:57.201 --> 18:00.796
The only way out of that city is the airport.
Build new cover identities for them...

18:00.955 --> 18:03.925
...you send in a Moses,
he takes them out on a commercial flight.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.927
- We've explored those options. ENGELL:
They'll never get past airport control.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.635
- Komiteh own the place.
- They could pose as reporters.

18:09.797 --> 18:11.958
- The government issued 70-something...
- Seventy-four.

18:12.008 --> 18:13.601
...visas for American journalists.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.761
The Revolutionary Guards
keep them on 74 leashes.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.807
If they're caught with
fake journalist creds,

18:17.833 --> 18:19.833
it's Peter Jennings' head
in a noose in an hour.

18:19.974 --> 18:22.102
North American accents
gives us limited options.

18:22.268 --> 18:24.270
So we get the Canadians
to issue them passports.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.860
What about English teachers
at the international school?

18:27.023 --> 18:29.697
It's a good idea, but that school's been
closed for eight months.

18:29.859 --> 18:31.486
Okay, so how about the do-gooders?

18:32.945 --> 18:34.847
Six Canadians have been
over there inspecting

18:34.873 --> 18:36.816
crops, making sure the
kids get enough to eat.

18:36.949 --> 18:39.498
We give them creds,
makes them look like Ag NGOs.

18:40.077 --> 18:42.796
It's a Feed the Kids thing. Okay?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.628
Those kids are black.

18:44.957 --> 18:46.504
Those are African kids.

18:46.667 --> 18:49.887
- We get ethnically appropriate kids.
- Are there starving kids in Iran?

18:50.046 --> 18:52.720
I'm sure there's some skinny kids
in Iran, so...

18:52.882 --> 18:55.726
- What about missionaries?
- A logo with seeds. Call it "Seeds of Hope."

18:55.885 --> 18:56.932
Hold on.

18:57.094 --> 19:00.644
Sir, do you have this newspaper in front
of you? Would you mind taking a look at it?

19:02.600 --> 19:03.897
What's in this picture?

19:04.060 --> 19:06.313
- Tehran.
- Right. What's on the ground?

19:08.731 --> 19:10.153
- Snow.
- Right.

19:10.441 --> 19:13.570
So, what crops are the do-gooders
inspecting under Frosty?

19:15.988 --> 19:19.333
Sir, exfils are like abortions.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.165
You don't wanna need one...

19:21.327 --> 19:24.171
...but when you do, you
don't do it yourself.

19:29.168 --> 19:30.761
You have a better plan?

19:31.754 --> 19:33.176
No, sir.

19:36.550 --> 19:39.350
<i>Whatever
the conﬂicting signals from Iran today...</i>

19:39.470 --> 19:40.910
<i>...and for that matter, every day...</i>

19:41.055 --> 19:44.104
<i>...about whether the hostages will
or will not be tried as spies...</i>

19:44.266 --> 19:47.987
<i>...the government of the United States
has not deviated from its basic demand:</i>

19:48.145 --> 19:50.273
<i>The hostages must be freed.</i>

19:50.439 --> 19:53.283
...claims to defend human rights,
it not only does not defend them...

19:53.442 --> 19:56.195
...it violates them for all nations.

19:56.362 --> 19:57.577
<i>We demand extradition...</i>

19:57.578 --> 19:58.195
<i>We demand extradition...</i>

19:58.367 --> 20:00.476
<i>...of a man who, for more
than 37 years, with the</i>

20:00.502 --> 20:02.458
<i>United States' support...</i>
U.S. EMBASSY, TEHRAN

20:02.459 --> 20:02.747
<i>...of a man who, for more than 37 years,
with the United States' support...</i>

20:02.910 --> 20:06.505
<i>...has killed months-old babies
in the arms of their mothers.</i>

20:06.664 --> 20:10.385
<i>He said if the Americans try
military force to rescue the hostages...</i>

20:10.543 --> 20:14.264
<i>...the students will kill them all
and blow up the embassy.</i>

20:14.964 --> 20:18.389
<i>Americans were outraged at Iran
and anyone Iranian.</i>

20:18.551 --> 20:21.551
<i>Before that decision was taken,
there was a demonstration in Houston.</i>

20:21.554 --> 20:23.306
<i>An Iranian flag was burned...</i>

20:23.472 --> 20:27.318
<i>...when anti-Iranian demonstrators
gathered near the Iranian consulate.</i>

20:27.476 --> 20:30.730
<i>... also is what led to a decision
to scrutinize the visas of Iranians...</i>

20:30.896 --> 20:33.775
They knew exactly what was going to happen.
They knew.

20:33.941 --> 20:36.444
But I don't understand
what they should do now.

20:36.610 --> 20:39.204
Send him back,
just to be tortured and killed?

20:39.363 --> 20:41.741
I don't think that justice
is the worst thing.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.706
<i>When did people first tell you that torture
was going on in Iran?</i>

20:44.869 --> 20:48.794
<i>They would never come to me and say,
"Well, sir, we have tortured this fellow. "</i>

20:48.956 --> 20:52.711
<i>President Sadat of Egypt,
he calls you, Imam...</i>

20:52.877 --> 20:55.221
<i>Forgive me, his words, not mine.</i>

20:55.379 --> 20:56.551
<i>...a lunatic.</i>

20:56.714 --> 20:59.718
Why didn't he have a choice?
Why do you think he didn't have a choice?

20:59.884 --> 21:01.227
He would've been
referred to as a barbarian.

21:01.385 --> 21:04.104
That's why they're saying
that their current regime...

21:04.263 --> 21:05.824
The shah did more for women's rights...

21:05.890 --> 21:09.019
I think you'd better...
Please, everyone, get into the crawlspace.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.414
<i>At one point,
the mob cornered one of the Iranians.</i>

21:29.580 --> 21:33.005
<i>When he tried to protect himself,
this is what happened.</i>

21:33.584 --> 21:34.961
<i>Just hit him again!</i>

21:35.127 --> 21:38.631
<i>We're not gonna take it any more!
We're sick of it!</i>

21:39.715 --> 21:41.058
<i>America!</i>

21:41.217 --> 21:46.849
<i>Even in our little community here, I mean,
people are drawn up tight, they're tense.</i>

21:47.181 --> 21:51.061
<i>They shouldn't even let those students
in that embassy there.</i>

21:51.227 --> 21:54.447
<i>Just shoot a couple of them,
show them we mean business.</i>

21:54.772 --> 21:57.776
<i>Men who served in Vietnam
for what they believed was right are angry.</i>

21:57.942 --> 21:59.034
<i>I'm mad as hell.</i>

21:59.193 --> 22:03.949
<i>I'm like the guy screaming on that movie
program in Network, you know? I've had it.</i>

22:04.114 --> 22:07.709
<i>And if need be, I'll bear arms again.</i>

22:07.868 --> 22:11.498
<i>And that's the way it is
Wednesday, January 16th, 1980.</i>

22:11.664 --> 22:15.919
<i>The 74th day of captivity
for 50 Americans in Iran.</i>

22:24.468 --> 22:26.436
- Hello?
<i>- Buddy man.</i>

22:26.595 --> 22:28.063
I'll get Mom.

22:28.222 --> 22:29.724
I'm looking for you.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.193
<i>Did you do your homework tonight?</i>

22:33.352 --> 22:36.105
- Yeah, it was easy.
<i>- Excellent. What are we watching?</i>

22:36.272 --> 22:38.366
<i>Battle for the Planet of the Apes.</i>

22:38.524 --> 22:39.867
Tell me, what channel is it on?

22:40.109 --> 22:41.281
Five.

22:45.322 --> 22:46.369
All right.

22:48.450 --> 22:51.545
- What'd you do at school today?
<i>- Nothing. I don't know. Nothing.</i>

22:53.414 --> 22:55.963
Can't be nothing.
Something must've happened.

22:56.125 --> 22:57.968
<i>After school I got some baseball cards.</i>

22:58.127 --> 22:59.549
- Mm-hm.
<i>- That was fun.</i>

23:17.229 --> 23:19.027
<i>Okay, you know those
science-fiction movies?</i>

23:19.189 --> 23:21.817
<i>Star Trek, Star Wars.</i>
They need an exotic location to shoot.

23:21.984 --> 23:24.453
Moonscape, Mars, desert, you know.

23:24.612 --> 23:25.909
Now, imagine this:

23:27.156 --> 23:31.332
They're a Canadian film crew on a location
scout for a science-fiction movie.

23:31.744 --> 23:32.996
We put it out there...

23:33.162 --> 23:34.960
The Canadian producers put it out there.

23:35.122 --> 23:36.762
...That we're looking at Egypt, Istanbul.

23:38.083 --> 23:42.429
Then we go to the consulate and say,
"Hey, we wanna look at Iran too."

23:42.588 --> 23:47.139
I fly into Tehran, we all fly out together
as a film crew. Done.

23:47.468 --> 23:50.517
Flamboyant cover identities should be avoided,
as it increases operational visibility.

23:50.679 --> 23:53.728
This is more plausible than foreigners
who wanna go be teachers in Iran.

23:53.891 --> 23:56.394
You wanna blend in with the population,
you don't look like a rodeo clown.

23:56.560 --> 23:59.279
Just gonna wake up tomorrow morning
and be in the movie business?

23:59.438 --> 24:01.281
We already have credentials
for the teachers.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.320
- No, sir, we have a contact in L.A.
- Chambers.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.528
John Chambers.
He's a Hollywood prosthetics guy.

24:05.694 --> 24:07.784
He's got an Oscar, he did
Planet of the Apes. Did

24:07.810 --> 24:09.690
a bunch of contract work
for us in the past.

24:09.823 --> 24:13.453
I go see him, he sets us up.
One, two days, make it look real.

24:28.717 --> 24:32.642
I went outside for 30 seconds. Could you give me a break?
I can't breathe in this house.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.966
- I need some fresh air. I can't breathe.
- Stay inside the fucking house.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.819
- Who saw me go outside? I'm just curious.
- That's not the point, Bob.

24:38.978 --> 24:41.231
- It doesn't matter who saw you go out.
- Did you see me?

24:41.397 --> 24:43.741
- No.
- I did, okay? I saw you.

24:43.899 --> 24:46.903
Bob, it only takes one second
for them to spot you.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.917
Some Americans are missing.

24:54.076 --> 24:56.249
Look at the repaired list
of embassy employees.

24:57.746 --> 24:59.339
The numbers don't match.

24:59.498 --> 25:02.422
Finish assembling the
pictures from the embassy.

25:02.584 --> 25:05.133
All I need is their faces
and I will find them.

25:05.295 --> 25:07.047
Yes, sir, it will be done.

25:19.309 --> 25:20.777
We want you to go to L.A.

25:20.936 --> 25:24.406
If you can make the movie thing credible,
we'll take you to the director.

25:25.232 --> 25:26.279
Don't fuck up.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.907
The whole country is watching you.

25:29.445 --> 25:31.163
They just don't know it.

25:38.495 --> 25:39.587
<i>My creation.</i>

25:41.081 --> 25:42.754
My creation.

25:49.006 --> 25:50.098
What the fuck, Brian?

25:50.257 --> 25:51.474
- Cut.
- We're cutting.

25:51.633 --> 25:53.852
- What an idiot.
- It really hurt.

25:54.011 --> 25:55.228
I'm sorry.

25:55.387 --> 25:58.357
Chambers. John Chambers, makeup!

25:59.641 --> 26:04.317
BURBANK, CALIFORNIA - JANUARY 19, 1980

26:10.152 --> 26:14.077
He says the Minotaur prosthetic
is too tight, so he can't act.

26:14.364 --> 26:16.992
If he could act, he wouldn't
be playing the Minotaur.

26:23.165 --> 26:24.587
Mr. Chambers?

26:25.292 --> 26:26.669
Kevin Harkins.

26:28.504 --> 26:29.972
Hey, Tony.

26:54.154 --> 26:55.280
Watch your head.

26:55.823 --> 26:57.370
What are you shooting?

26:57.699 --> 26:59.417
Monster movie.

27:00.410 --> 27:01.582
Yeah? Any good?

27:03.288 --> 27:05.040
Target audience will hate it.

27:05.207 --> 27:06.709
Who's the target audience?

27:06.917 --> 27:08.464
People with eyes.

27:11.130 --> 27:12.382
Talk to me.

27:14.341 --> 27:15.718
It's an exfil.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.056
From where?

27:18.220 --> 27:19.642
Worst place you can think of.

27:19.805 --> 27:21.182
Universal City.

27:27.980 --> 27:29.732
How are you gonna get into the embassy?

27:29.940 --> 27:33.240
They're not in the embassy.
During the takeover, six people escaped.

27:33.443 --> 27:35.241
They're hiding out in Tehran.

27:35.654 --> 27:38.703
- And that's who I'm gonna go get.
- What am I making?

27:39.700 --> 27:41.577
I need you to help me make a fake movie.

27:41.743 --> 27:44.246
Heh. You came to the right place.

27:44.413 --> 27:47.587
I wanna set up a production company
and build a cover around making a movie.

27:47.749 --> 27:49.751
- That we're not gonna make.
- No.

27:50.335 --> 27:52.679
So you wanna come to Hollywood
and act like a big shot?

27:52.838 --> 27:54.806
- Without actually doing anything?
- No.

27:54.965 --> 27:56.558
You'll fit right in.

28:02.723 --> 28:03.940
Let's see.

28:04.558 --> 28:07.983
Well, this one's got an M.A. in English.
She should be your screenwriter.

28:08.145 --> 28:11.069
Sometimes they go along on scouts
because they want the free meals.

28:11.231 --> 28:12.949
Here's your director.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.281
Can you teach somebody
to be a director in a day?

28:15.485 --> 28:17.783
You can teach a rhesus monkey
to be a director in a day.

28:18.572 --> 28:21.792
Look, if you're gonna do this,
you gotta do it.

28:21.950 --> 28:24.248
The Kho-maniacs are Froot Loops,
but they got cousins...

28:24.411 --> 28:26.630
...who sell prayer rugs
and eight-tracks on La Brea.

28:27.456 --> 28:30.756
You can't build cover stories
around a movie that doesn't exist.

28:30.918 --> 28:33.091
You need a script. You need a producer.

28:33.253 --> 28:34.425
- Make me a producer.
- No.

28:34.588 --> 28:37.933
You're an associate producer at best.

28:38.592 --> 28:41.641
If you're gonna do a $20 million
<i>Star Wars</i> rip-off...

28:41.803 --> 28:45.649
...you need somebody who's a somebody
to put their name on it.

28:45.807 --> 28:47.730
Somebody respectable.

28:48.936 --> 28:50.153
With credits.

28:51.146 --> 28:53.820
Who you can trust
with classified information.

28:54.816 --> 28:57.035
Who'll produce a fake movie.

28:57.653 --> 28:59.075
For free.

29:13.001 --> 29:16.175
Hi. I only got a couple of minutes.
I'm getting a lifetime achievement award.

29:16.338 --> 29:17.931
<i>- Mazel tov</i>, Lester.
- Ah.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.593
I'd rather stay home and count
the wrinkles on my dog's balls.

29:21.593 --> 29:25.848
Okay, you got six people hiding out
in a town of, what, 4 million people...

29:26.014 --> 29:29.689
...all of whom chant "Death to America"
all the livelong day.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.444
You want to set up a movie in a week.

29:31.603 --> 29:35.028
You want to lie to Hollywood,
a town where everybody lies for a living.

29:35.190 --> 29:37.693
Then you're gonna sneak 007 over here...

29:37.859 --> 29:41.363
...into a country that wants CIA blood
on their breakfast cereal...

29:41.530 --> 29:45.034
...and you're gonna walk the Brady Bunch
out of the most watched city in the world.

29:45.200 --> 29:47.953
Past about a hundred militia
at the airport. That's right.

29:49.496 --> 29:50.873
Right.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.376
Look, I gotta tell you.

29:54.543 --> 29:58.514
We did suicide missions in the Army
that had better odds than this.

29:58.672 --> 30:00.140
Sir, the car is here.

30:07.764 --> 30:10.813
You ever think, Lester,
how this is all for the cameras?

30:10.976 --> 30:14.025
Well, they're getting the ratings,
I'll say that for...

30:25.907 --> 30:27.830
We're gonna need a script.

30:36.835 --> 30:38.929
Here, come on, come on, come on.

30:39.087 --> 30:40.259
- No, it's fine.
- Stop.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.600
Okay.

30:57.773 --> 30:58.865
I love you.

31:08.658 --> 31:10.786
Sahar, how are you doing?

31:11.787 --> 31:13.255
Fine, thank you.

31:14.539 --> 31:16.712
Your friends from Canada, ma'am.

31:16.875 --> 31:20.550
All this time. They never go out.

31:33.809 --> 31:35.652
Sahar knows.

31:39.272 --> 31:41.445
How about <i>The Horses of Achilles?</i>

31:41.608 --> 31:44.077
No good. Nobody does Westerns any more.

31:44.236 --> 31:48.412
- It's ancient Troy.
- If it's got horses in it, it's a Western.

31:48.573 --> 31:49.620
Hey, Kenny, please.

31:50.158 --> 31:52.160
Yeah, it's John Chambers,
about the office space.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.796
It doesn't matter. It's a fake movie.

31:54.955 --> 31:58.459
If I'm doing a fake movie,
it's gonna be a fake hit.

31:58.625 --> 32:02.255
<i>The cardinal wants all
cover options on his desk Friday morning.</i>

32:02.421 --> 32:05.675
Engell's prepping the bikes option,
the teachers option.

32:05.841 --> 32:09.141
You have 72 hours to make yours better.

32:09.636 --> 32:10.853
Fine.

32:35.620 --> 32:39.466
Hey, is A006 still on the open list?

32:40.083 --> 32:41.130
Yeah, I'll hold.

32:41.626 --> 32:45.631
"Fade in on a starship landing.
An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe.

32:45.797 --> 32:49.552
Women gather, offering ecstatic
libations to the sky gods.

32:50.135 --> 32:53.184
<i>Argo.</i> A science-fantasy adventure."

32:53.346 --> 32:56.566
- it's in turnaround. It's dog shit.
- It's a space movie in the Middle East.

32:56.725 --> 32:58.365
- Does it matter?
- Can we get the option?

32:59.478 --> 33:01.025
Why do we need the option?

33:01.188 --> 33:05.068
You're worried about the Ayatollah?
Try the WGA.

33:06.902 --> 33:08.324
Just let me do the talking.

33:08.487 --> 33:11.741
I've known this guy for 25 years.
He's full of shit and he comes on hard...

33:11.907 --> 33:13.580
...but I can handle him.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.038
You want to go into production
with this in one month?

33:18.205 --> 33:19.832
Up like a carny ride.

33:19.998 --> 33:21.045
One month, yeah.

33:21.208 --> 33:23.586
- Who are you again?
- Kevin Harkins. Studio Six Films.

33:23.752 --> 33:25.129
He's the money.

33:25.295 --> 33:30.392
Look, what do you say 15 thou
and let's close on this?

33:32.427 --> 33:34.100
You want me to be honest with you, Les?

33:34.262 --> 33:36.731
No. I would like you to bullshit me, Max.

33:36.890 --> 33:38.392
All right.

33:38.808 --> 33:41.277
I enjoyed your films. The early ones.

33:41.436 --> 33:45.566
I took this meeting out of respect,
because I wanted to say no to your face.

33:46.816 --> 33:48.614
Thank you. Very respectful.

33:48.944 --> 33:50.287
You're finished, Lester.

33:50.820 --> 33:52.697
Get your cataracts fixed, read the trades.

33:53.907 --> 33:56.456
MGM just capitalized for six new films.

33:56.618 --> 33:59.087
They're screaming for sci-fi.

33:59.329 --> 34:02.458
They're offering me four times
what you guys are offering me.

34:03.959 --> 34:07.429
Well, what can I say?

34:07.629 --> 34:09.222
Congratulations.

34:09.714 --> 34:13.935
But, see, it kind of worries me,
what you said, and let me tell you why.

34:15.094 --> 34:18.850
Couple of weeks ago, I was sitting at
Trader Vic's, I was enjoying a Mai Tai...

34:19.014 --> 34:20.733
...when my pal Warren Beatty comes in.

34:20.891 --> 34:22.985
He wishes me well, we had a little chat.

34:23.478 --> 34:26.447
Seems he was attached
to star in <i>Zulu Empire...</i>

34:26.606 --> 34:28.824
...which was gonna anchor that MGM slate.

34:28.984 --> 34:32.079
But Warren confided in me
that the picture's gone over budget...

34:32.237 --> 34:35.161
...because the Zulu extras wanna unionize.

34:35.322 --> 34:37.917
They may be cannibals,
but they want health and dental...

34:38.076 --> 34:39.373
...so the movie's kaput.

34:39.536 --> 34:42.755
Which means that the MGM deal
ain't gonna happen...

34:42.914 --> 34:45.757
...and your script ain't worth
the buffalo shit on a nickel.

34:46.418 --> 34:48.170
So the way it looks to me...

34:48.378 --> 34:50.176
Through the cataracts, I grant you.

34:50.380 --> 34:52.132
...Is that you can either sign here...

34:52.299 --> 34:55.303
...and take $10,000
for your toilet paper script...

34:55.467 --> 34:57.687
...or you can go fuck yourself.

34:58.513 --> 35:00.607
With all due respect.

35:06.896 --> 35:08.443
You really know Warren Beatty?

35:08.607 --> 35:12.362
Yes, I do. I took a leak next to him
once at the Golden Globes.

35:13.028 --> 35:14.325
Taco?

35:32.672 --> 35:33.844
Got any kids, Lester?

35:35.175 --> 35:37.052
Yeah. I have two daughters.

35:38.470 --> 35:39.722
You see them much?

35:40.347 --> 35:41.815
I talk to them once a year.

35:42.891 --> 35:44.939
- Maybe.
- Why is that?

35:48.438 --> 35:50.440
I was a terrible father.

35:52.233 --> 35:55.533
The bullshit business,
it's like coal mining.

35:55.695 --> 35:58.995
You come home to your wife and kids,
you can't wash it off.

36:01.159 --> 36:02.251
You?

36:03.578 --> 36:05.080
Yeah, I got a son.

36:06.331 --> 36:08.459
He lives in Virginia with his mother.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.047
You're divorced?

36:14.255 --> 36:16.053
Taking time off.

36:18.176 --> 36:20.270
He needs to be, you know...

36:20.428 --> 36:21.475
...where he is.

36:23.932 --> 36:25.934
Kids need the mother.

36:34.567 --> 36:37.527
They caught the shah's chief of security
trying to get on a plane to Paris.

36:40.281 --> 36:41.453
<i>Listen.</i>

36:41.616 --> 36:44.995
Since the incident, the number of guards
at the airport has doubled.

36:45.161 --> 36:48.085
Thorough background examinations
should be expected.

36:48.248 --> 36:51.468
The movie cover isn't strong enough yet.
I need another week, Jack.

36:51.918 --> 36:53.761
You don't have it.

36:55.755 --> 36:56.802
We got an office.

36:57.799 --> 36:59.893
We got business cards.

37:00.051 --> 37:01.894
We got a poster.

37:02.804 --> 37:06.104
If I'm the Revolutionary Guard, that's
nothing we couldn't have made at home.

37:06.307 --> 37:08.230
Six people's lives depend on this.

37:09.644 --> 37:13.649
It's not enough. If we're gonna fool
these people, it has to be big.

37:13.815 --> 37:16.819
And it has to have something
that says it's authentic.

37:17.777 --> 37:20.997
I did a movie with Rock Hudson one time.

37:21.948 --> 37:24.292
If you wanna sell a lie...

37:25.326 --> 37:27.829
You get the press to sell it for you.

37:28.788 --> 37:32.543
No, no, no. Press event and then
they're gonna read through the script.

37:32.709 --> 37:36.680
Well, they got a bunch of actors,
they're gonna read from beginning to end.

37:36.838 --> 37:38.681
They have costumes and everything.

37:38.840 --> 37:42.595
No, no, no, I can't.
Variety has an exclusive on that.

37:42.761 --> 37:45.935
Is there any way to make this
more Middle Eastern?

37:46.598 --> 37:48.191
Mesopotamia? Egypt?

37:48.349 --> 37:49.441
Iran.

37:49.601 --> 37:53.196
Look, I can get you in, but you're gonna
have to promise me at least half a page.

37:53.354 --> 37:56.483
No, no, this thing's an event.
It's gonna be a spectacle.

38:58.419 --> 39:02.174
- Lester?
- Nina. You look fabulous.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.432
You're doing the reading?

39:03.633 --> 39:05.761
I'm playing Serksi, the Galactic Witch.

39:05.927 --> 39:07.895
Great. I'll call you.

39:09.347 --> 39:11.941
Keep that fucking space witch
away from me.

39:12.141 --> 39:14.439
- You know her?
- I was married to her.

39:14.644 --> 39:16.271
Oh, my God, Iraq is amazing.

39:16.437 --> 39:17.563
Oh, we're shooting in Iran.

39:17.730 --> 39:19.152
Iran with an N?

39:19.315 --> 39:20.908
Yeah. We're very excited.

39:21.067 --> 39:22.364
You ever watch the news?

39:22.527 --> 39:24.279
What does the title refer to?

39:25.029 --> 39:27.623
The Argo. You know, it's the thing.

39:27.782 --> 39:29.534
Like Jason and the Golden Fleece,
or what?

39:29.701 --> 39:31.624
No, no. It's the ship. It's the spaceship.

39:31.786 --> 39:36.633
It goes everywhere.
It goes all throughout space.

39:37.250 --> 39:38.422
So it's the Argonaut.

39:39.043 --> 39:40.090
No.

39:40.253 --> 39:42.381
- What does "Argo" mean?
- I don't know.

39:42.547 --> 39:43.639
You don't know?

39:43.798 --> 39:46.267
It means "Argo fuck yourself."

39:48.386 --> 39:51.105
Excuse me. May I have
your attention, ladies and gentlemen?

39:51.264 --> 39:55.815
If our artists could settle in. We're
just about ready to begin the reading.

39:55.977 --> 39:59.732
Argo, by Mary Ann Boyd.

39:59.898 --> 40:02.117
"Fade in on starship landing.

40:02.275 --> 40:03.822
Exterior, bazaar.

40:03.985 --> 40:06.829
An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe."

40:14.495 --> 40:17.669
<i>The people working here are not diplomats.</i>

40:17.832 --> 40:20.301
<i>In fact, as Imam Khomeini said...</i>

40:20.460 --> 40:24.340
<i>...we have found no evidence that proves
that these people are diplomats.</i>

40:24.505 --> 40:29.011
<i>All evidence proves
that these people are spies.</i>

40:29.177 --> 40:32.852
In the name of God,
the beneficent, the merciful...

40:33.014 --> 40:35.642
...our message to the awakened peoples
of the world:

40:35.808 --> 40:38.527
At this time we want
to expose the hateful acts...

40:38.686 --> 40:40.859
Our world has changed.

40:41.314 --> 40:44.284
The fire of hope stopped burning
in this galaxy long ago.

40:44.776 --> 40:46.528
The ship is turning around.

40:46.736 --> 40:48.204
Fire the thrusters!

40:48.363 --> 40:50.923
He says a gravitational field
that strong will kill anyone.

40:50.949 --> 40:53.327
<i>- Were completely unjustified.</i>

40:53.493 --> 40:55.166
<i>They and all others must know...</i>

40:55.995 --> 40:58.874
<i>...that the United States of America
will not yield...</i>

40:59.040 --> 41:01.759
<i>...to international
terrorism or to blackmail.</i>

41:01.918 --> 41:05.639
Sir! We'll be crushed!
There's not enough time!

41:05.797 --> 41:08.892
...are controlled by
capitalists and large oil companies.

41:09.050 --> 41:12.554
The United States government considers
revolutionaries as terrorists...

41:12.720 --> 41:17.567
...but itself and its CIA are the most
terrorizing organization of all time.

41:17.767 --> 41:20.520
<i>"The story was told,
but there are infinitely more.</i>

41:20.687 --> 41:23.566
<i>Three setting suns.
The princess's robes fall from her body."</i>

41:23.731 --> 41:26.575
<i>If we find his ship
we will find our chance.</i>

41:27.568 --> 41:31.368
Aboard the Argo lies
my hope, my hero, my husband.

41:31.531 --> 41:34.910
We will begin the trials
and carry out the sentences.

41:35.076 --> 41:38.954
<i>You wonder where and how this seemingly
endless parade of hatred will end.</i>

41:38.955 --> 41:39.003
<i>You wonder where
and how this seemingly</i>

41:39.029 --> 41:39.053
<i>endless parade of hatred will end.</i>

41:39.250 --> 41:42.286
<i>What do they want? They say the question
should be not "what?" but "who?"</i>

41:43.046 --> 41:43.713
<i>What do they want? They say the question
should be not "what?" but "who?"</i>

41:43.876 --> 41:46.550
<i>The answer to that is clear.
They want their former shah.</i>

41:46.713 --> 41:49.993
<i>... Carter and his administration
shameful to talk about human rights.</i>

41:50.091 --> 41:54.346
Carter and his government have given
asylum to the worst criminal of all.

41:54.512 --> 41:55.559
<i>For life?</i>

41:55.722 --> 41:59.101
<i>They will remain
until the shah is returned.</i>

41:59.392 --> 42:02.896
<i>But if the exiled shah,
now in a New York City hospital...</i>

42:03.062 --> 42:06.236
<i>...leaves the United States
for any place other than Iran...</i>

42:06.399 --> 42:08.618
<i>...harsher decisions will be taken
against the hostages.</i>

42:14.907 --> 42:17.535
<i>"We cut outside
to the Shidoori Dome...</i>

42:17.702 --> 42:19.545
<i>...holding on a single red ﬂower...</i>

42:19.704 --> 42:23.129
...as it grows from the ruins
of a starship in the desert.

42:23.291 --> 42:26.921
Fade to black." The end.

42:32.258 --> 42:34.932
There is it. What'd I tell you?

42:35.303 --> 42:37.055
First shot of the picture.

42:41.350 --> 42:42.647
Argo fuck yourself.

42:43.227 --> 42:45.229
Argo fuck yourself.

43:08.002 --> 43:08.842
OFFICE OF THE
SECRETARY OF STATE JANUARY 25, 1980

43:08.843 --> 43:10.763
OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE
JANUARY 25, 1980

43:22.183 --> 43:26.780
Brace yourself. It's like talking to
those two old fucks on <i>The Muppets.</i>

43:30.316 --> 43:31.533
Aliens and robots?

43:32.902 --> 43:34.449
Yes, sir.

43:34.987 --> 43:38.332
You're telling me that there is a movie
company in Hollywood right now...

43:38.491 --> 43:40.289
...that is funded by the CIA?

43:40.910 --> 43:42.082
Yes, sir.

43:43.412 --> 43:47.007
- What's wrong with the bikes again?
- We tried to get the message upstairs, sir.

43:47.166 --> 43:49.794
You think this is more plausible
than teachers?

43:49.961 --> 43:53.340
Yes, we do. One, there are no
more foreign teachers in Iran.

43:53.506 --> 43:55.725
And we think everybody
knows Hollywood people.

43:55.925 --> 44:00.431
Everybody knows they'd shoot in Stalingrad with
Pol Pot directing if it would sell tickets.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.891
There are only bad options.

44:03.057 --> 44:04.559
It's about finding the best one.

44:05.560 --> 44:07.562
You don't have a better bad idea than this?

44:07.728 --> 44:10.481
This is the best bad idea we have, sir.

44:10.648 --> 44:11.695
By far.

44:19.991 --> 44:23.996
The United States government has just
sanctioned your science-fiction movie.

44:25.121 --> 44:26.168
Thank you, sir.

45:02.617 --> 45:07.544
I'm required to remind you that if you are
detained, the agency will not claim you.

45:09.207 --> 45:10.379
Barely claim me as it is.

45:12.585 --> 45:14.303
Your "in case of's" good?

45:15.379 --> 45:16.881
It's just Christine.

45:19.759 --> 45:21.761
I should've brought some books
to read in prison.

45:21.928 --> 45:22.975
No.

45:23.638 --> 45:25.640
They'll kill you long before prison.

45:27.642 --> 45:28.814
- Thanks for the ride.
- Yeah.

45:39.111 --> 45:40.158
Studio Six.

45:40.321 --> 45:43.575
We got a green light. Keep the office
running until you hear otherwise.

45:44.075 --> 45:45.167
Argo fuck yourself.

45:45.993 --> 45:47.040
Argo fuck yourself.

46:05.721 --> 46:07.519
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

46:07.682 --> 46:11.186
<i>This is the final boarding call
for British Airways Flight 87.</i>

46:43.551 --> 46:45.224
<i>"We are a nation of 35 million.</i>

46:46.595 --> 46:50.395
And many of these people are looking
forward to martyrdom."

46:53.561 --> 46:55.905
- Hey.
- Hey.

46:56.605 --> 46:57.982
Come to bed.

46:58.983 --> 47:00.155
In five minutes.

47:11.996 --> 47:14.374
You know, she pleaded with me.

47:15.041 --> 47:18.386
When it started in the streets
nine months ago...

47:19.420 --> 47:21.923
...she begged for us to leave.

47:23.007 --> 47:25.931
She packed our bags, and I said:

47:26.093 --> 47:29.267
"You know what?
You know, just a little bit longer."

47:31.599 --> 47:33.693
And all I was thinking was:

47:35.853 --> 47:37.400
"Stay..

47:38.397 --> 47:40.195
This is good for me.

47:41.317 --> 47:42.785
Stay.

47:45.821 --> 47:47.448
Show Newsom you got the balls."

47:53.287 --> 47:56.131
I can't believe I put
Kathy in this position.

48:04.673 --> 48:07.051
I think we're gonna die here.

48:34.036 --> 48:38.132
ISTANBUL, TURKEY - JANUARY 27, 1980

48:56.559 --> 49:00.985
"Iran is 100 percent
not in a prerevolutionary state."

49:01.147 --> 49:04.196
CIA brief, November 1st, 1979.

49:04.358 --> 49:06.360
Can't be right all the time.

49:06.861 --> 49:08.033
Kevin.

49:08.529 --> 49:09.746
When'd you get back?

49:10.948 --> 49:13.167
The shah escaped in a 747...

49:13.367 --> 49:16.712
...so laden with gold bars,
it nearly didn't make it off the runway.

49:16.871 --> 49:17.918
But you kept busy.

49:18.080 --> 49:23.132
Ferrying out the torture apparatus
of our friend's fallen dictatorship.

49:23.586 --> 49:25.088
It's getting worse.

49:25.254 --> 49:28.224
Everyone who lands at Mehrabad
now fills in one of these.

49:29.383 --> 49:33.263
That slip makes a copy to the one underneath.
Passenger keeps yellow, airport keeps white.

49:33.429 --> 49:34.976
When you leave, they match them up...

49:35.139 --> 49:37.517
...to verify you came into the country
when you say you did.

49:37.683 --> 49:41.654
So if they look, they'll see I didn't come
into the country with six people.

49:42.396 --> 49:44.148
If they look.

49:46.192 --> 49:51.198
When you land, you should go straight to the
Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance...

49:51.405 --> 49:52.827
...to kiss the ring.

49:52.990 --> 49:56.210
Get on record as having applied
for a film permit.

49:56.535 --> 50:00.130
If they catch you later, at least they'll
be confused while they're torturing you.

50:04.084 --> 50:08.055
IRANIAN CONSULATE - TURKEY

50:17.848 --> 50:19.976
What will be the purpose
of your visit to Iran?

50:20.351 --> 50:23.480
Uh, film production. Business.

50:25.856 --> 50:28.655
Why didn't you get your visa in Canada?

50:30.027 --> 50:33.873
I would've loved to, except my boss
didn't send a telex till I got here.

50:34.532 --> 50:38.127
Guy had an intelligent thought in his head,
it would die of loneliness.

50:59.098 --> 51:01.817
The <i>Times</i> and AP found out six escaped.

51:01.976 --> 51:05.321
They know who they are and they know
they're hiding out with the Canadians.

51:05.479 --> 51:07.277
Somebody with one of the families talked.

51:07.481 --> 51:08.824
Mother of God.

51:08.983 --> 51:11.782
Yeah, I just put Vance on a plane
to take the editors to Le Cirque.

51:11.944 --> 51:14.413
He thinks he can
get them to sit on it, for now.

51:15.406 --> 51:17.374
Your guy better get them...

51:18.033 --> 51:19.910
...and get the hell out.

51:20.703 --> 51:23.673
<i>The captain has informed
us that we have entered Iranian airspace.</i>

51:23.831 --> 51:28.337
<i>We'll be coming through to collect
any remaining alcoholic beverages.</i>

54:06.535 --> 54:08.208
This film crew is just yourself?

54:08.746 --> 54:11.716
No, we have six more from Canada
meeting us today.

54:11.874 --> 54:13.717
You like to film at the bazaar?

54:14.209 --> 54:16.052
The bazaar, maybe the palace.

54:16.879 --> 54:18.506
Landmark sites.

54:18.714 --> 54:20.307
I see.

54:21.091 --> 54:22.968
The exotic Orient.

54:23.385 --> 54:26.764
Snake charmers, flying carpets.

54:27.681 --> 54:30.560
You came to us at a complicated time.

54:30.726 --> 54:34.731
Before the revolution, 40 percent of the movie
theaters in Tehran were showing pornography.

54:35.898 --> 54:37.150
I understand.

54:37.316 --> 54:40.490
The function of this
office is purification...

54:40.694 --> 54:43.948
...as well as promotion for the arts.

54:45.240 --> 54:47.834
I'll review this for the minister.

54:48.577 --> 54:49.999
Okay. Thank you.

54:58.420 --> 55:01.219
Lester, you're working late.

55:01.381 --> 55:03.304
Till the dawn's early light.

55:03.467 --> 55:07.347
You got stamina, Lester. I wanna be you.

55:07.554 --> 55:10.398
Well, I'm 150 years old,
so you wouldn't be me for long.

55:20.317 --> 55:22.490
- Mr. Ambassador.
- Ken Taylor.

55:22.653 --> 55:24.155
Thank you for what you're doing.

55:24.947 --> 55:27.791
I was expecting more of a G-man look.

55:28.867 --> 55:30.869
I think you're thinking of the FBI, sir.

55:31.662 --> 55:34.006
Ah. This way.

55:46.134 --> 55:49.855
- These are blank, you know. Stamps...
- Yeah, I'll take care of this.

55:52.057 --> 55:53.183
How long?

55:53.392 --> 55:56.191
A day, prep their covers.
Two if they need it.

55:56.353 --> 55:57.696
And you'll fly out with them?

55:58.105 --> 55:59.732
Yeah.

55:59.898 --> 56:01.571
There's something you should know.

56:01.775 --> 56:05.029
We think our housekeeper
has figured out who they are.

56:05.571 --> 56:10.042
We don't know if we can trust her,
so sooner is better.

56:59.917 --> 57:01.214
Hi.

57:01.376 --> 57:03.253
My name's Kevin Harkins...

57:04.338 --> 57:05.931
...and I'm gonna get you home.

57:07.382 --> 57:10.010
These are the screenplays
for your cover identities.

57:11.637 --> 57:14.106
It's theater of the absurd.

57:14.264 --> 57:16.858
- What are our chances?
- Your chances are good.

57:17.017 --> 57:20.146
"Good“? Well, what's the number value
of "good"?

57:20.354 --> 57:23.073
Thirty percent chance
of being publicly executed?

57:23.231 --> 57:26.781
Can you tell me what the objection was
to normal cover identities?

57:26.944 --> 57:29.185
There are no Canadians in the country
for normal reasons.

57:29.321 --> 57:30.868
- They'll sniff us out regardless.
- The Swedish Consul?

57:31.031 --> 57:34.706
They accused him of being an American
at the airport. They held him for an hour.

57:34.868 --> 57:37.917
We can't hold up under that. We don't
know what the hell movie people do.

57:38.080 --> 57:39.206
That's why I'm here.

57:39.373 --> 57:42.877
I'm gonna help you. I'll be with you
the whole way. This is what I do.

57:43.043 --> 57:45.091
Have you gotten people out
this way before?

57:46.421 --> 57:47.923
This would be a first.

57:49.424 --> 57:53.019
Do you know that every day they catch
another friend of the shah at the airport?

57:53.178 --> 57:55.681
Kangaroo trials and then firing squads...

57:55.889 --> 57:58.608
...just for having American names
in their phone books.

57:58.767 --> 58:00.235
You've been here an hour.

58:00.394 --> 58:02.817
And you're asking us to trust you
with our lives, Mr...?

58:02.980 --> 58:04.323
Harkins.

58:04.523 --> 58:06.321
That's your real name?

58:06.984 --> 58:08.156
No.

58:11.113 --> 58:14.913
I know there are risks involved.
Serious risks.

58:15.409 --> 58:17.127
But it is time to go.

58:19.579 --> 58:23.209
We've got orders to close the embassy and go back.
There's nowhere for them to stay.

58:25.711 --> 58:29.432
We will never make it through
immigration at the airport. I'm serious.

58:29.589 --> 58:33.514
No, no, no, this is what, the part when we
say this is so crazy it might actually work?

58:33.677 --> 58:35.520
Joe, I saw it in Burma.
They get people out.

58:35.679 --> 58:38.933
Snitches in banana republics? They get
them over the border after the coup.

58:39.099 --> 58:40.146
That's your opinion, Joe.

58:40.308 --> 58:42.481
You know, his opinion got us out
in the first place.

58:42.978 --> 58:47.108
If we go out there with fake passports,
we are spies, period. That's execution.

58:47.274 --> 58:49.823
- You got a problem lying, Joe?
- Point is, we can't stay here.

58:50.485 --> 58:54.115
If we get caught, you and Pat go on trial
for harboring the enemy, you know that?

58:54.281 --> 58:56.875
Pat and I have discussed it.
It's the risk we took.

58:57.659 --> 59:00.583
That man out there
has got bad cards and he is going to lose.

59:00.746 --> 59:04.046
And if he loses, it's our lives.

59:05.333 --> 59:07.335
And his life too.

59:08.754 --> 59:10.677
Look, we don't have any alternatives.

59:10.839 --> 59:12.056
We gotta go.

59:18.555 --> 59:22.025
These cover identities were created
specifically for each one of you.

59:22.184 --> 59:24.733
What you need to do is memorize
everything that's inside.

59:24.895 --> 59:27.819
Who you are, what you are,
where you've been. Complete bio.

59:27.981 --> 59:29.073
And then add to that.

59:29.232 --> 59:32.657
Where do you vacation? What are your
allergies? Who'd you have an affair with?

59:32.819 --> 59:33.991
The only way this works...

59:34.154 --> 59:37.829
...is if you believe that you're these
people so much that you dream like them.

59:38.784 --> 59:40.502
Get started tonight.

59:41.203 --> 59:44.207
I'll be back tomorrow.
We'll get going. Good luck.

59:49.795 --> 59:51.513
Well, my guy kind of sucks.

59:51.671 --> 59:53.048
What's your name?

59:53.757 --> 59:56.055
Mike McEwan, eh? Heh.

59:57.010 --> 59:58.057
That was convincing.

59:58.220 --> 59:59.893
Kathy, what's your name?

01:00:27.874 --> 01:00:31.094
<i>The Love Boat
will be seen 15 minutes from now.</i>

01:00:31.253 --> 01:00:35.053
<i>The State Department insisted today
that the crisis in Afghanistan...</i>

01:00:35.215 --> 01:00:39.311
<i>...will not divert the attention of the United
States from the plight of the hostages.</i>

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:42.188
<i>- -is perceived to be if not impotent,
then at least reluctant...</i>

01:00:42.347 --> 01:00:46.853
<i>Now the United States finds itself in such
bitter confrontation with the Soviet Union...</i>

01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:49.862
<i>...over that country's invasion
of Afghanistan...</i>

01:00:50.063 --> 01:00:52.486
<i>The United States
is now moving toward a decision...</i>

01:00:52.649 --> 01:00:54.697
<i>...to boycott the Summer Olympics
in Moscow...</i>

01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:59.081
Bad news, bad news.
Even when it's good news, it's bad news.

01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:03.577
John Wayne's in the ground six months,
this is what's left of America.

01:01:32.105 --> 01:01:35.735
<i>"The Minister of Culture and Guidance
has approved your location scout.</i>

01:01:35.901 --> 01:01:37.824
He will send his representative to meet
you and your crew...

01:01:37.986 --> 01:01:41.581
...at the Khayyam entrance
to the Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 p.m."

01:01:42.449 --> 01:01:43.621
They called your bluff.

01:01:43.783 --> 01:01:46.377
- Maybe they're cooperating.
<i>- Absolutely not.</i>

01:01:46.786 --> 01:01:51.166
Seven Americans walking the bazaar
is asking for a riot. It's the hive.

01:01:51.333 --> 01:01:52.676
Seven Canadians, Jack.

01:01:52.834 --> 01:01:55.963
<i>Never give them multiple shots at a cover.</i>

01:01:56.671 --> 01:01:57.968
Are they even ready?

01:01:58.131 --> 01:01:59.383
They're getting there.

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:01.096
There's no prize for "Most improved."

01:02:01.259 --> 01:02:03.978
I don't have a choice.
We say no, they show up at the residence...

01:02:04.137 --> 01:02:06.858
...and drag everyone out.
You think their covers are gonna hold up...

01:02:06.932 --> 01:02:09.012
...when they're getting their fingernails
pulled out?

01:02:29.537 --> 01:02:32.791
You want us to go to the Grand Bazaar
at 3:00 in the afternoon?

01:02:33.875 --> 01:02:36.879
You said a day to learn our covers,
then straight to the airport.

01:02:37.045 --> 01:02:38.672
They suspect something?

01:02:38.838 --> 01:02:41.591
What I know is,
we need to pretend to be a movie crew.

01:02:41.758 --> 01:02:45.183
We go to the bazaar today,
we fly out from the airport tomorrow.

01:02:47.264 --> 01:02:48.686
We won't do it.

01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:53.194
He told them that there were six of us.
So they're expecting six.

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:55.572
It would be suspicious
not to show up at this point.

01:02:55.730 --> 01:02:57.858
What else do we have to do, all right?

01:02:58.024 --> 01:03:00.573
He's about to show them
the only cards that we're holding...

01:03:00.735 --> 01:03:04.410
...which is that they don't know we're here!
- That's the ball game, okay?

01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:06.700
Look, we don't have any other choice!

01:03:06.866 --> 01:03:09.210
Who says that we'll know our covers
well enough?

01:03:09.369 --> 01:03:11.121
We're not in the CIA.

01:03:12.247 --> 01:03:13.874
It's suicide.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:16.134
I'm asking you to trust me.

01:03:17.544 --> 01:03:18.716
I don't trust you.

01:03:21.256 --> 01:03:23.805
This is the game, Joe.
What world are you living in?

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:27.597
The one where they're hanging people
from construction cranes, Bob.

01:03:28.388 --> 01:03:30.857
It's too dangerous.
I won't bring my wife into the bazaar.

01:03:32.934 --> 01:03:34.277
Joe?

01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:42.827
So we'll see you at 2.

01:04:05.675 --> 01:04:10.772
So don't be recognizable
but look exactly like your passport photo.

01:04:12.015 --> 01:04:14.484
I haven't been this nervous
since our wedding.

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:18.363
Only this isn't a huge mistake, hopefully.

01:04:19.814 --> 01:04:21.691
Sorry. Okay.

01:04:24.444 --> 01:04:25.787
Hello?

01:04:28.531 --> 01:04:29.953
Hello?

01:04:30.658 --> 01:04:31.784
Hello?

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:39.963
Who was that?

01:04:43.296 --> 01:04:45.014
- Mark?
- Yeah?

01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.893
I'm scared.

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:52.473
It's okay.

01:05:40.353 --> 01:05:41.525
Where are they?

01:05:41.688 --> 01:05:43.031
In the kitchen.

01:05:59.956 --> 01:06:03.426
This is what I do. I get people out.

01:06:04.919 --> 01:06:07.763
And I've never left anyone behind.

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:11.810
I wish I could believe you, Mr. Harkins.

01:06:16.931 --> 01:06:20.231
My name is Tony Mendez.
I'm from New York.

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:23.146
My father worked construction.
My mother teaches elementary school.

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:25.691
I have a wife and a 10-year-old son.

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:32.785
You play along with me today,
I promise you, I will get you out tomorrow.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.878
Fuck.

01:07:19.452 --> 01:07:21.329
Shit.

01:07:48.356 --> 01:07:49.858
Hang on.

01:08:38.031 --> 01:08:39.658
You all right?

01:08:44.912 --> 01:08:47.085
Okay. Tell me who you are.

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:50.042
Mike McEwan, cameraman.

01:08:50.585 --> 01:08:52.804
Robert Baker, director.

01:08:53.254 --> 01:08:55.256
Timothy Harris, location manager.

01:08:55.423 --> 01:08:57.425
Mary Ann Boyd, screenwriter.

01:08:57.591 --> 01:08:59.344
Rachel Dewart, production designer.

01:08:59.551 --> 01:09:01.270
Sean Bissett, associate producer.

01:09:01.429 --> 01:09:03.978
All right. Let's go make a movie.

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:19.279
Welcome, welcome.
My name is Reza Bolhani.

01:09:19.447 --> 01:09:21.825
- Kevin Harkins. I'm the producer.
- Nice to meet you.

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:23.618
This is Mike McEwan, our cameraman.

01:09:23.785 --> 01:09:26.004
This is Tim.
This is Mary, our screenwriter.

01:09:26.162 --> 01:09:27.663
And this is our director, Bob Baker.

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:29.582
- You are the director?
- Yes.

01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:32.218
Is this film a foreign-bride film?

01:09:33.127 --> 01:09:34.424
Sorry?

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:37.055
A film where a foreign
bride comes to Iran...

01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:40.765
...but she doesn't understand the language
or the customs...

01:09:40.926 --> 01:09:43.475
...and there is misunderstandings
and laughs.

01:09:43.638 --> 01:09:45.106
Oh, no.

01:09:50.310 --> 01:09:55.784
The bazaar in Tehran
is one of the largest in the world.

01:09:56.359 --> 01:10:00.535
This bazaar has been on this spot
for over 8000 years.

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:04.918
You can find many items
such as paper, spices...

01:10:05.118 --> 01:10:07.621
...precious metals, all right here.

01:10:07.787 --> 01:10:09.004
Right this way, please.

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:15.754
This way.

01:10:30.852 --> 01:10:32.149
- Uh, Mike?
- Yeah.

01:10:32.311 --> 01:10:36.487
If I was to say you're looking through the wrong
end of that viewfinder, would I be right?

01:10:38.776 --> 01:10:40.369
Yup.

01:10:47.577 --> 01:10:48.703
Just a little further.

01:11:18.691 --> 01:11:21.945
Please wait here. Let's stay together.

01:11:38.753 --> 01:11:40.505
He wants the photograph you took.

01:11:40.671 --> 01:11:43.766
It's okay, it's her job to take photographs.
She's the production designer.

01:11:43.925 --> 01:11:47.179
He says he did not give you permission
to take a photograph of his store.

01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:50.019
That's okay. You can
tell him he can have it.

01:11:51.307 --> 01:11:53.401
Please, please, just take the photograph.

01:12:03.194 --> 01:12:04.354
Peace be upon you.

01:12:04.403 --> 01:12:05.780
And upon you, sir. Welcome.

01:12:05.947 --> 01:12:07.199
I hope you are well.

01:12:07.365 --> 01:12:09.038
Thank you very much. How are you?

01:12:09.242 --> 01:12:11.620
I'm very well. What's your name?

01:12:11.786 --> 01:12:12.958
Sahar.

01:12:23.965 --> 01:12:27.139
He's saying that the shah killed his son
with an American gun.

01:12:36.811 --> 01:12:39.189
No, no, no! No! Canada!

01:12:39.355 --> 01:12:40.402
Canada!

01:12:40.565 --> 01:12:42.863
I would like to suggest
that we end our visit.

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:53.293
You know, sister...

01:12:53.452 --> 01:12:57.457
...those who are with him, Rasool of Allah,
we are tender among ourselves.

01:12:57.623 --> 01:12:59.170
But stern against the Kufar.

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:01.214
As God wills it.

01:13:02.837 --> 01:13:06.057
But those who sit silently have sinned.

01:13:07.508 --> 01:13:09.510
How else may I help, sir?

01:13:09.677 --> 01:13:12.021
No, no, just one thing.

01:13:13.890 --> 01:13:15.517
How long have they been here?

01:13:16.767 --> 01:13:17.814
Pardon?

01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:20.861
The guests of the Ambassador.

01:13:20.862 --> 01:13:23.182
The guests of the Ambassador.
How long have they been here?

01:13:25.109 --> 01:13:26.702
They arrived two days ago.

01:13:27.486 --> 01:13:32.208
Forgive my intrusion, one must be vigilant.

01:13:33.492 --> 01:13:36.371
Everyone in this house is a friend of Iran.

01:14:10.905 --> 01:14:12.373
How'd it go?

01:14:13.991 --> 01:14:15.618
What about tomorrow?

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:18.500
Tomorrow they'll be ready.

01:14:22.416 --> 01:14:24.714
<i>For Kennedy, a stunning turnaround...</i>

01:14:24.877 --> 01:14:26.925
<i>...one week after humiliation in Illinois.</i>

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:28.385
<i>I love New York.</i>

01:14:29.757 --> 01:14:32.306
<i>And I love Connecticut too.</i>

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:35.096
<i>How did he win here? Well, he had help.</i>

01:14:35.262 --> 01:14:39.893
<i>I'm responsible for anything
that goes wrong in this government.</i>

01:14:40.059 --> 01:14:44.109
A man in Scranton is placing a flag
in his lawn for every day of captivity.

01:14:45.106 --> 01:14:48.235
When he runs out of lawn,
Kennedy wins the primary.

01:14:48.776 --> 01:14:51.199
The six with the Canadians
are coming out.

01:15:02.248 --> 01:15:03.841
Who signed off on this?

01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.799
- You. Where was your passport issued?
- Vancouver.

01:15:06.961 --> 01:15:08.258
- Where were you born?
- Toronto.

01:15:08.421 --> 01:15:10.423
"Torono." Canadians don't pronounce the T.

01:15:10.589 --> 01:15:13.012
Some Komiteh guard
is actually gonna know that?

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:16.975
If you're detained for questioning, they
will bring in someone who knows that. Yes.

01:15:17.138 --> 01:15:20.358
Mary, who were the last three
prime ministers of Canada?

01:15:20.808 --> 01:15:23.311
Trudeau, Pearson and Diefenbaker.

01:15:23.477 --> 01:15:25.150
- What's your father's name?
- Howard.

01:15:25.312 --> 01:15:27.064
- What's his occupation?
- Fisherman.

01:15:27.231 --> 01:15:29.484
- Where were you born?
- Halifax, Nova Scotia.

01:15:29.650 --> 01:15:31.402
What's your date of birth?

01:15:31.569 --> 01:15:33.742
February 21st, 1952.

01:15:33.946 --> 01:15:35.869
- Good. What's your job on the movie?
- Producer.

01:15:36.032 --> 01:15:38.785
- Associate. Last movie you produced?
<i>- High and Dry.</i>

01:15:38.951 --> 01:15:40.453
- Who paid for that?
- CFDC.

01:15:40.619 --> 01:15:42.963
What's your middle name?
What's your middle name?

01:15:43.122 --> 01:15:44.840
- Leon?
- Shoot him. He's an American spy.

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:50.297
Look, they're gonna try to break you, okay?
By trying to get you agitated.

01:15:50.463 --> 01:15:52.591
You have to know your résumé
back to front.

01:15:52.757 --> 01:15:57.103
You really believe your little story's gonna make
a difference when there's a gun to our heads?

01:15:58.012 --> 01:16:01.186
I think my story's the only thing
between you and a gun to your head.

01:16:04.518 --> 01:16:05.565
Okay.

01:16:10.775 --> 01:16:13.745
Hey, they made it through
the location scout.

01:16:25.998 --> 01:16:27.375
You have a call.

01:16:38.302 --> 01:16:39.349
What is it?

01:16:39.512 --> 01:16:40.604
Go to black on green.

01:16:43.307 --> 01:16:44.399
Go.

01:16:44.558 --> 01:16:46.026
<i>- It all just changed.</i>
- What?

01:16:46.185 --> 01:16:48.779
<i>- They're calling the game. You gotta come back.</i>
- What?

01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:51.657
Joint Chiefs are planning
a military rescue of the hostages.

01:16:51.816 --> 01:16:54.365
<i>Delta Force has started training
to storm the grounds.</i>

01:16:54.527 --> 01:16:56.404
<i>So if the six of them...</i>

01:16:56.570 --> 01:17:00.200
...are brought down there,
they won't be held for long.

01:17:01.033 --> 01:17:04.754
Fuck. Goddamn it. I never would have exposed
them if I wasn't authorized to get them out.

01:17:04.912 --> 01:17:07.631
- It's over, Tony.
- If they stay here, they will be taken.

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:12.546
- Probably not alive.
- Listen to me. The thinking has changed.

01:17:12.711 --> 01:17:16.386
Six Americans get pulled out of a
Canadian diplomat's house and executed...

01:17:16.549 --> 01:17:18.472
...it's a world outrage.

01:17:18.634 --> 01:17:21.604
Six Americans get caught playing
movie make-believe...

01:17:21.762 --> 01:17:24.436
...with the CIA at the
airport and executed?

01:17:24.598 --> 01:17:29.479
It's a national embarrassment.
They are calling the operation.

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:34.279
We're responsible for these people.

01:17:35.276 --> 01:17:38.075
What we are is required to follow orders.

01:17:38.946 --> 01:17:40.323
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:17:49.707 --> 01:17:51.084
Fuck!

01:17:57.923 --> 01:17:58.970
Come in.

01:18:00.593 --> 01:18:02.186
Ready to try again.

01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:07.183
You're ready. You worked hard.

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:11.229
Probably the best thing to do for you
right now would be...

01:18:12.104 --> 01:18:13.526
...just to relax.

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:15.403
Okay.

01:18:15.941 --> 01:18:17.409
You did good.

01:18:18.319 --> 01:18:19.616
Thanks.

01:18:31.999 --> 01:18:35.299
Scorched-earth policy tonight.

01:18:37.004 --> 01:18:38.847
Nothing gets left.

01:18:45.971 --> 01:18:47.393
So you know.

01:18:49.183 --> 01:18:52.983
ExtAff wants you to burn the passports
before you leave.

01:18:55.147 --> 01:18:59.152
If we tell them now, they'll panic.
I think it's best if you just don't show.

01:19:01.654 --> 01:19:03.702
It was always a fucked mission.

01:19:04.365 --> 01:19:06.663
You came closer than anybody else.

01:19:10.621 --> 01:19:15.621
<i>If it keeps on rainin'
Levee's goin' to break</i>

01:19:24.343 --> 01:19:30.021
<i>When the levee breaks
I'll have no place to stay</i>

01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:39.988
Ahem. It's off.
They want us to pack up the office.

01:21:41.688 --> 01:21:43.816
This can wait. Let's go get a drink.

01:22:09.133 --> 01:22:11.056
He's late.

01:22:24.481 --> 01:22:25.528
O'Donnell.

01:22:25.691 --> 01:22:26.943
<i>Somebody's responsible...</i>

01:22:27.109 --> 01:22:28.952
...when things happen, Jack.

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:31.158
I'm responsible.

01:22:31.363 --> 01:22:33.957
- I'm taking them through.
- Tony?

01:22:43.876 --> 01:22:48.302
Alan. Alan. We need to confirm those
seven tickets out of Tehran on Swissair.

01:22:48.464 --> 01:22:50.762
- N.E. shut that down.
- I say it's back on.

01:22:50.924 --> 01:22:53.677
- I can't do it. It's backstopped.
- Hey, wait a minute.

01:22:53.844 --> 01:22:56.848
What the hell you talking about, backstopped?
What the hell's that mean?

01:22:57.014 --> 01:22:59.813
Carter's gotta say yes for us
to get the tickets.

01:23:09.610 --> 01:23:10.827
It's time to go.

01:23:21.163 --> 01:23:22.210
All right.

01:23:23.957 --> 01:23:26.756
- Where's Engell?
- He's in a meeting.

01:23:26.919 --> 01:23:29.843
- Pull him out.
- Uh...

01:23:30.005 --> 01:23:31.177
Pull him out!

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:33.260
Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.

01:23:33.759 --> 01:23:35.432
- Thank you.
- See you soon.

01:23:35.594 --> 01:23:37.517
- Sahar's on a bus.
- Great.

01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:39.101
Sahar will be fine.

01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:41.016
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:23:41.266 --> 01:23:44.520
- You two leave right now, right?
- We'll be on a train in half an hour.

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:45.778
Good.

01:23:49.358 --> 01:23:50.575
<i>N.E. said no.</i>

01:23:50.734 --> 01:23:55.410
<i>This is not a long leasher, and it never
has been, and you don't decide if it goes!</i>

01:23:55.572 --> 01:23:56.789
It is going!

01:23:56.949 --> 01:23:58.951
Jack, you are this close.

01:23:59.117 --> 01:24:00.994
Am I? Am I really that close?

01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:03.129
You are this goddamn close to the line
with me.

01:24:03.288 --> 01:24:06.838
I am not gonna leave him at the airport
with six people and his dick in his hand.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:10.470
You tell the director to call the White House.
Do your fucking job!

01:24:19.096 --> 01:24:20.188
Get to your plane, Claude.

01:24:27.187 --> 01:24:30.657
First time anyone's gonna ask you
a question is at the first checkpoint.

01:24:31.316 --> 01:24:33.819
<i>The first checkpoint is just
to get a look at your passports.</i>

01:24:34.194 --> 01:24:37.994
<i>Passports came straight from Ottawa
last week. They're clean.</i>

01:24:38.407 --> 01:24:40.250
Find the White House chief of staff.

01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:41.501
How would I find him?

01:24:41.660 --> 01:24:44.664
We're a fucking spy agency! Find him!

01:24:45.414 --> 01:24:48.759
The second checkpoint is immigration.

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:50.669
You're each gonna hand them one of these.

01:24:50.836 --> 01:24:53.430
<i>It says that you landed in the country
two days ago.</i>

01:24:54.172 --> 01:24:57.016
<i>They'll look for the matching white one,
which doesn't exist.</i>

01:24:57.175 --> 01:24:58.973
<i>You'll say you don't know what happened.</i>

01:24:59.136 --> 01:25:01.059
<i>And if you believe they
lost the white slip...</i>

01:25:02.306 --> 01:25:03.398
<i>...they'll believe it too.</i>

01:25:04.266 --> 01:25:07.361
Jordan's in the West Wing.
He's not taking calls.

01:25:08.854 --> 01:25:10.356
Where are his kids?

01:25:10.522 --> 01:25:11.569
What?

01:25:11.732 --> 01:25:13.279
Where do his kids go to school?

01:25:20.365 --> 01:25:21.787
Thank you, thank you.

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:24.203
Pace Academy, Buckhead, Georgia.

01:25:27.581 --> 01:25:28.628
White House.

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:33.387
Yes, this is Mr. Murphy from Pace Academy
calling for Mr. Jordan.

01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:35.889
Yeah, I'm afraid it is an emergency.

01:25:36.048 --> 01:25:38.267
Hold for the chief of staff's office.

01:25:38.467 --> 01:25:41.016
The third checkpoint is the trap.

01:25:41.178 --> 01:25:42.805
It's manned by the Revolutionary Guard.

01:25:43.430 --> 01:25:45.683
Most of them were educated
in the U.S. or Europe.

01:25:46.224 --> 01:25:49.103
And all of whom are looking for Americans.

01:26:00.947 --> 01:26:01.994
Hello?

01:26:02.157 --> 01:26:03.998
<i>- Jack O'Donnell, from C. I.</i>
- Wait, wait, who?

01:26:04.117 --> 01:26:07.917
Tehran Houseguest operation is ready now.
We don't have the president's go-ahead.

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:10.174
<i>They are going to be captured.</i>

01:26:10.332 --> 01:26:11.458
David, pick up!

01:26:29.101 --> 01:26:31.650
Zurich. It's under Harkins.

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:42.494
I'm sorry, sir, I don't seem
to have these reservations.

01:26:46.034 --> 01:26:47.957
Telex on flash.

01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:50.964
Would you mind checking again, please?

01:26:59.631 --> 01:27:02.384
Copy D.S. Confirm the tickets! Go!

01:27:15.897 --> 01:27:17.490
My apologies. It just came through.

01:27:25.157 --> 01:27:26.875
Swissair says they picked up the tickets.

01:27:27.033 --> 01:27:29.707
Get the L.A. office,
tell them to be ready in case they call.

01:27:29.870 --> 01:27:31.998
We told them to shut that down.

01:28:03.111 --> 01:28:04.533
There you go.

01:28:21.379 --> 01:28:22.801
Not here.

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:27.779
When did you come to Iran?

01:29:28.321 --> 01:29:30.119
Two days ago.

01:29:30.282 --> 01:29:31.955
What was the purpose of your visit?

01:29:33.034 --> 01:29:35.628
We are looking for locations for a film.

01:29:42.419 --> 01:29:43.511
We have a...

01:29:43.670 --> 01:29:48.551
Oh, yeah. I've got a letter
from the Ministry of Culture.

01:29:49.467 --> 01:29:51.720
If you want to take a look at that.
All right?

01:30:11.907 --> 01:30:13.955
- Ahem.
- You can go.

01:30:23.501 --> 01:30:25.174
Come on, come on.

01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:42.154
<i>Swissair Flight 363
is now boarding Rows 18 to 35.</i>

01:31:16.554 --> 01:31:18.807
We're going to...

01:31:47.335 --> 01:31:51.056
We're together, yes.
The six of us, we're from Canada.

01:31:52.549 --> 01:31:54.643
Purser's telling Swissair
they're not on the plane.

01:31:54.801 --> 01:31:56.303
They should have boarded already.

01:31:56.469 --> 01:31:58.062
Still no answer in L.A.

01:32:23.121 --> 01:32:24.293
Sir.

01:32:34.299 --> 01:32:37.803
Yes, it's a fantasy
story about a war in another world.

01:32:37.969 --> 01:32:39.687
Here you can see our notices.

01:32:43.975 --> 01:32:45.852
Of course I speak Farsi.

01:32:46.019 --> 01:32:48.238
I wish to make a film in Iran.

01:33:04.996 --> 01:33:08.466
No, I'm the writer.

01:33:08.666 --> 01:33:10.543
Kevin, give me the storyboards.

01:33:11.127 --> 01:33:15.177
These are the drawings that show
what we will film for the movie.

01:33:15.340 --> 01:33:18.014
Alien villains have taken
over the hero's planet.

01:33:18.176 --> 01:33:21.350
They fight for their families and
take back the city.

01:33:21.513 --> 01:33:27.862
The villains know he is the chosen one,
so they kidnap his son in the spice market.

01:33:29.395 --> 01:33:32.023
So he and his wife storm the castle.

01:33:32.190 --> 01:33:36.382
The people... hold that... the
people are inspired to join him.

01:33:36.408 --> 01:33:39.224
They are farmers, but
they learn to fight.

01:33:42.951 --> 01:33:44.749
They shoot weapons at their enemies.

01:33:48.957 --> 01:33:52.211
And the king of the aliens is destroyed
when the people find their courage.

01:34:01.386 --> 01:34:03.514
You don't go until we verify.

01:34:08.059 --> 01:34:10.107
I understand.

01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:12.443
Sir, you can call our office.

01:34:12.605 --> 01:34:13.948
They'll verify.

01:34:39.215 --> 01:34:42.095
- It'd go all the way throughout the '30s.
- We're shooting right now.

01:34:42.218 --> 01:34:46.098
- We're just going to the Producers Building.
- Yeah, I understand. We're shooting right now.

01:35:20.131 --> 01:35:23.852
<i>Swissair announces
final boarding for Flight 363 to Zurich.</i>

01:35:31.809 --> 01:35:33.561
Reset! We're back to one.

01:35:33.728 --> 01:35:35.696
- All right, reset.
- We're going again!

01:35:35.855 --> 01:35:38.859
- We're just right at the Producers...
- Right away, everyone! And rolling!

01:35:39.025 --> 01:35:41.323
- We're going to the Producers Building.
- We're rolling.

01:36:17.647 --> 01:36:20.617
Sorry, pal. We're gonna be in the movie.
Call my agent.

01:36:20.817 --> 01:36:22.114
Sir!

01:36:34.038 --> 01:36:36.040
Studio Six Productions.

01:36:36.958 --> 01:36:39.381
May I speak to a Mr. Kevin Harkins?

01:36:39.544 --> 01:36:43.720
I'm sorry, Mr. Harkins is out of country
on a location scout. May I take a message?

01:37:01.357 --> 01:37:04.782
<i>Doors are closing for Flight 363 to Zurich.</i>

01:37:13.036 --> 01:37:14.253
We can go.

01:37:23.463 --> 01:37:25.636
You keep these. It's a gift.

01:37:53.117 --> 01:37:54.289
Miss.

01:39:58.910 --> 01:40:00.912
Swissair 363, clearance for taxi?

01:40:04.081 --> 01:40:07.585
Swissair 363,
you are number two for departure.

01:40:14.926 --> 01:40:18.772
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, from the
ﬂight deck, we are number two for takeoff.</i>

01:40:55.967 --> 01:40:58.891
Swissair 363, you are cleared for takeoff.

01:41:02.974 --> 01:41:04.851
Swissair 363, cleared for takeoff.

01:42:10.166 --> 01:42:11.213
We got wheels up.

01:42:11.751 --> 01:42:12.798
Wait.

01:42:28.392 --> 01:42:31.066
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is our pleasure to announce...

01:42:31.228 --> 01:42:34.949
...that alcoholic beverages are now available
as we have cleared Iranian airspace.

01:42:39.945 --> 01:42:41.447
<i>I love you.</i>

01:43:23.489 --> 01:43:25.787
They're clear. Ha-ha-ha!

01:43:25.950 --> 01:43:27.452
Yes! Yes!

01:43:28.327 --> 01:43:30.455
- Yeah!
- Yes!

01:43:30.621 --> 01:43:31.793
Yeah, man.

01:43:32.248 --> 01:43:33.966
They're out!

01:43:34.125 --> 01:43:37.345
- They're out! They're out!
- We got them out!

01:43:40.673 --> 01:43:41.799
They're out!

01:43:46.178 --> 01:43:47.805
Yes!

01:43:47.972 --> 01:43:50.145
Great work, boys.

01:43:50.307 --> 01:43:51.308
We did it!

01:44:03.320 --> 01:44:06.494
You are admitted to the Republic of Iraq.

01:44:51.035 --> 01:44:52.878
<i>We made history tonight.</i>

01:44:54.038 --> 01:44:57.383
History starts out as farce
and ends up as tragedy.

01:44:57.917 --> 01:44:59.544
Quote's the other way around.

01:45:00.211 --> 01:45:02.714
- Yeah, who said it?
- Marx.

01:45:03.631 --> 01:45:04.678
Groucho said that?

01:45:09.220 --> 01:45:11.723
Call the Times, nail
it to the goddamn door.

01:45:11.889 --> 01:45:13.607
CIA are the good guys.

01:45:13.766 --> 01:45:15.609
The Canadians are the good guys.

01:45:15.768 --> 01:45:17.486
Yeah, we're not greedy. Them too.

01:45:18.229 --> 01:45:22.735
Only. Canada takes the credit,
or they retaliate against the hostages.

01:45:23.567 --> 01:45:25.410
Great Satan wasn't involved.

01:45:26.153 --> 01:45:28.155
No CIA.

01:45:28.364 --> 01:45:29.911
Is that right, Jack?

01:45:32.076 --> 01:45:33.794
Involved in what?

01:45:34.787 --> 01:45:37.290
We were as surprised as anybody.

01:45:40.251 --> 01:45:41.969
Thank you, Canada.

01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:44.843
MacDONALD:
<i>We knew that each day they stayed there...</i>

01:45:45.005 --> 01:45:47.679
<i>...the danger was becoming greater.</i>

01:45:47.883 --> 01:45:49.908
<i>We had been looking for
a solution to have them</i>

01:45:49.934 --> 01:45:51.958
<i>leave the country during
the past three months.</i>

01:45:52.096 --> 01:45:54.770
<i>Day 87, and finally a sliver
of really good news.</i>

01:45:54.932 --> 01:45:58.732
The U.S. Department of State
hereby honors Joe Stafford...

01:46:00.229 --> 01:46:01.651
...Kathy Stafford...

01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:04.658
...Mark Lijek...

01:46:05.276 --> 01:46:10.498
<i>We Americans will be forever grateful to
our great friend and ally to the north...</i>

01:46:10.656 --> 01:46:14.911
<i>...for the protection and the safe passage
provided for our diplomats.</i>

01:46:15.077 --> 01:46:16.329
Bob Anders.

01:46:16.495 --> 01:46:19.214
<i>Here, or anywhere in the world...</i>

01:46:19.373 --> 01:46:20.966
<i>...Canada will pay...</i>

01:46:22.293 --> 01:46:26.298
<i>...for this violation
of the sovereignty of Iran.</i>

01:46:26.463 --> 01:46:30.684
<i>Thank you to Pat and Ken Taylor
and the great nation of Canada.</i>

01:46:34.513 --> 01:46:37.234
So I'm sitting in Jerry's
this morning, I'm having breakfast.

01:46:37.391 --> 01:46:40.486
Waitress comes over to me,
she's waving a newspaper, and she says:

01:46:40.644 --> 01:46:44.023
"You see what those Canadians pulled off?
Why can't we do something like that?"

01:46:44.815 --> 01:46:46.658
And I said to her... Do
you know what I said?

01:46:47.067 --> 01:46:48.193
No, what?

01:46:48.736 --> 01:46:50.204
"Argo fuck yourself."

01:47:18.974 --> 01:47:20.021
All set.

01:47:20.976 --> 01:47:22.353
Thanks a lot.

01:47:33.489 --> 01:47:34.490
Ha!

01:47:35.866 --> 01:47:39.370
Heh. And I left my autograph book at home.

01:47:45.000 --> 01:47:46.718
His Eminence called me.

01:47:46.877 --> 01:47:48.094
He wants to see you.

01:47:48.587 --> 01:47:50.305
Probably wants to fire me himself.

01:47:51.423 --> 01:47:53.767
He wants to give you the Intelligence Star.

01:47:54.969 --> 01:47:56.812
You're getting the highest
award of merit...

01:47:57.012 --> 01:48:00.357
...of the Clandestine Services
of these United States.

01:48:01.308 --> 01:48:03.231
Ceremony's on the 14th.

01:48:03.394 --> 01:48:06.568
If they push it a week, I can bring Ian.
That's his winter break.

01:48:08.065 --> 01:48:12.411
The op was classified,
so the ceremony's classified.

01:48:12.569 --> 01:48:15.618
He can't know about it.
Nobody can know about it.

01:48:17.157 --> 01:48:20.252
So they're just gonna give me an award
and then they're gonna take it back.

01:48:20.828 --> 01:48:21.875
That's right.

01:48:23.747 --> 01:48:26.091
If we wanted applause,
we would've joined the circus.

01:48:27.793 --> 01:48:29.921
- I thought we did.
- Ha.

01:48:30.587 --> 01:48:33.386
Carter said you were a great American.

01:48:34.091 --> 01:48:35.764
Great American what?

01:48:36.301 --> 01:48:37.769
He didn't say.

01:48:51.108 --> 01:48:52.360
What happened to your picture?

01:48:53.986 --> 01:48:55.203
It's in turnaround.

01:49:37.488 --> 01:49:39.081
Can I come in?

01:50:25.077 --> 01:50:27.421
The Iran Hostage Crisis ended
on January 20, 1981, when all

01:50:27.447 --> 01:50:30.102
remaining hostages were released.
They spent 444 days in captivity.

01:50:37.422 --> 01:50:38.690
The involvement of the C.l.A.
complemented efforts of

01:50:38.716 --> 01:50:40.004
the Canadian embassy in freeing
the six held in Tehran.

01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:41.250
To this day, this story
stands as an enduring model

01:50:41.276 --> 01:50:43.236
for international cooperation
between governments.

01:50:48.976 --> 01:50:55.404
All of the Houseguests returned to the U.S.
Foreign Service after their ordeal in Iran.

01:50:56.942 --> 01:51:02.072
Oscar-winning makeup artist John Chambers was
awarded the C.I.A.'s Intelligence Medal, its

01:51:02.098 --> 01:51:06.945
highest civilian honor. He and Mendez remained
friends until Chambers' death in 2001.

01:51:08.704 --> 01:51:12.135
Tony Mendez's Intelligence Star
was returned to him in 1997,

01:51:12.161 --> 01:51:15.704
when the Argo operation was
declassified by President Clinton.

01:51:25.721 --> 01:51:33.697
He lives in rural Maryland with his family.

01:53:26.133 --> 01:53:31.139
<i>They went in, as you know, under the
guise of creating a motion-picture film.</i>

01:53:31.346 --> 01:53:35.977
<i>But that it had a very high possibility
of failure.</i>

01:53:36.143 --> 01:53:38.441
<i>And after it was successful, of course...</i>

01:53:38.603 --> 01:53:41.402
<i>...it was a great temptation
to reveal all the stories...</i>

01:53:41.565 --> 01:53:44.990
<i>...so maybe I could take a little bit
of credit for it, since I was president...</i>

01:53:45.152 --> 01:53:49.749
<i>...but we had to keep it secret.
Tony Mendez has gone down in CIA history...</i>

01:53:49.906 --> 01:53:51.783
<i>...after his retirement...</i>

01:53:51.950 --> 01:53:58.799
<i>...as one of the 50 most important
CIA operatives of all time.</i>

01:53:59.416 --> 01:54:04.798
<i>Eventually we got every hostage
back home, safe and sound...</i>

01:54:04.963 --> 01:54:08.968
<i>...and we upheld the integrity of our
country, and we did it peacefully.</i>
