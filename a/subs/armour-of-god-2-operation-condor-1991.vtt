01:04.272 --> 01:05.149
Oops!

03:13.027 --> 03:15.362
Just looking! I'll put it back.

03:19.909 --> 03:20.993
For me?

03:22.828 --> 03:24.246
This is for me?

03:28.417 --> 03:29.460
For me?

03:30.586 --> 03:31.587
Really?

03:32.880 --> 03:34.298
Thank you!

03:37.676 --> 03:39.929
This one too? OK.

04:01.450 --> 04:03.160
Keep that for yourself.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.625
Look, a water bottle!

04:22.972 --> 04:24.515
For emergencies.

04:40.614 --> 04:43.909
You already took the gems.

04:43.993 --> 04:46.161
You want holy water too?

04:46.370 --> 04:47.454
This is holy water?

04:47.579 --> 04:50.249
Do you know what will happen?

04:50.416 --> 04:51.709
Is it poisonous?

04:51.834 --> 04:55.504
No, but you have to be her husband.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.341
Heavier penalty than stealing the gems?

04:59.842 --> 05:02.177
I used to be stronger than you.

05:05.431 --> 05:08.225
Come back! You must take my place.

05:09.852 --> 05:12.646
Catch him! Bring him back!

05:22.948 --> 05:24.033
Happy New Year!

06:04.990 --> 06:05.741
Bye!

06:57.626 --> 06:59.253
Here are the gems.

07:07.803 --> 07:10.681
Take me with you and they're yours!

07:14.143 --> 07:15.602
All for nothing!

07:37.374 --> 07:39.001
Looks like my vacation is over!

08:37.558 --> 08:38.769
Feel free to browse.

08:39.061 --> 08:39.770
You're Japanese?

08:39.895 --> 08:40.395
Yes!

08:40.562 --> 08:41.438
Sir.

08:41.605 --> 08:43.941
Can you do me a favor?

08:44.066 --> 08:45.901
Sure! I'll buy one.

08:46.652 --> 08:49.363
No, I need to go to the toilet.

08:49.530 --> 08:51.532
Can you keep an eye for me?

08:51.698 --> 08:52.574
Sure! Go ahead!

08:52.699 --> 08:56.578
Thanks. I'll be right back.

09:09.424 --> 09:10.884
Feel free to browse, Miss.

09:11.969 --> 09:13.220
Interesting dolls!

09:13.387 --> 09:14.763
From Africa?

09:14.846 --> 09:16.640
Africa? I thought they're from Japan.

09:16.807 --> 09:17.766
You don't know what you're selling?

09:17.849 --> 09:18.934
Do you know the price?

09:19.351 --> 09:20.394
Price?

09:21.478 --> 09:22.688
1,000 pesetas.

09:22.813 --> 09:23.689
What?

09:26.650 --> 09:27.859
That's cheap!

09:28.694 --> 09:30.821
That doll she's holding looks fishy.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.035
No, it's the money.

09:38.537 --> 09:39.621
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

09:43.375 --> 09:44.251
Robbery?

09:47.546 --> 09:48.297
You can't force me to change money.

09:48.463 --> 09:49.172
This is the official rate

09:49.298 --> 09:50.549
I don't want to deal with you.

09:51.383 --> 09:52.301
This bank note looks alright.

09:52.426 --> 09:52.926
Follow her.

09:54.428 --> 09:55.345
Stop!

09:56.346 --> 09:57.180
I want mine back.

09:57.431 --> 09:58.471
This is your compensation.

09:58.557 --> 09:59.433
Let's go

09:59.558 --> 10:01.143
<i>2</i> for 'I is a good deal.

10:01.310 --> 10:02.144
Thank you

10:02.311 --> 10:03.645
I sold something for you.

10:03.854 --> 10:05.856
Really? This is...

10:05.981 --> 10:07.524
The guy had no change.

10:07.733 --> 10:08.984
How many did you sell?

10:10.110 --> 10:11.403
That one in the middle.

10:11.528 --> 10:12.321
Thanks.

10:12.404 --> 10:13.864
Where did you get these?

10:13.989 --> 10:15.532
My African friend made them

10:15.657 --> 10:16.658
I want this one.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.081
Sorry! I must go now.

10:24.958 --> 10:25.876
This is for you.

10:26.793 --> 10:27.586
Thanks.

10:32.466 --> 10:33.634
Car thief!

10:41.683 --> 10:42.434
Stop!

10:44.186 --> 10:45.062
Stop it!

10:45.103 --> 10:46.938
Condor, the Baron sent us.

10:58.158 --> 10:58.918
How are you, Baron?

10:59.034 --> 10:59.910
Welcome, Jackie!

11:00.077 --> 11:01.662
How do you like the Amazon River?

11:01.828 --> 11:03.413
Not bad. Friendly people.

11:03.538 --> 11:06.166
Good guys are welcome anywhere.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.585
Let's have some tea.

11:08.710 --> 11:11.421
You didn't ask me here for tea

11:12.089 --> 11:15.592
Jackie, about World War <i>ll.</i>

11:15.759 --> 11:16.843
How much do you know?

11:16.968 --> 11:18.970
That there should not be another one.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.849
Towards the end of World War <i>ll.</i>

11:22.974 --> 11:25.852
When the Germans pulled out from Africa.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.147
An army command was ordered to.

11:29.314 --> 11:32.984
Bury the gold seized by the Germans.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.987
In a secret military base in Africa.

11:36.113 --> 11:39.157
Count Von Katterling headed the mission.

11:39.282 --> 11:41.326
He designated his aide.

11:41.952 --> 11:45.038
To lead 18 guards to the mission.

11:45.163 --> 11:47.124
But all of them.

11:47.290 --> 11:48.542
Upon completion of the mission.

11:48.709 --> 11:50.585
Vanished without a trace.

11:50.836 --> 11:52.045
Where do I come in?

11:52.796 --> 11:55.966
I've been commissioned by
the UN to find the gold.

11:56.091 --> 11:56.883
The gold was...

11:56.967 --> 12:00.053
Seized by the Germans from occupied Europe.

12:00.220 --> 12:03.724
Many countries lay claim to it.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.559
Under this delicate circumstance

12:05.642 --> 12:07.227
I feel that appointing an Asian.

12:07.352 --> 12:09.438
To carry out the mission unofficially.

12:09.563 --> 12:12.274
Would be more appropriate.

12:12.441 --> 12:14.067
That's why you're here.

12:15.652 --> 12:17.112
Let me introduce you.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.364
Colonel Bart, meet Condor.

12:19.489 --> 12:20.407
My pleasure.

12:20.532 --> 12:21.324
Lieutenant Colonel Banner.

12:21.450 --> 12:22.617
Nice to meet you.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.536
This is Ada.

12:26.288 --> 12:27.122
How are you?

12:27.497 --> 12:29.541
Ada is professor Pautz's student.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.668
She's an expert on the desert.

12:31.835 --> 12:32.794
With her as your guide.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.172
You'll find the target in no time.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.007
She's taking me to the desert?

12:37.340 --> 12:39.509
You don't have much confidence in me.

12:39.634 --> 12:40.469
Don't get me wrong

12:40.594 --> 12:42.012
I always plan for the worst.

12:42.137 --> 12:42.804
And hope for the best.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.473
If you do your homework.

12:44.556 --> 12:45.307
Plan and prepare.

12:45.432 --> 12:46.975
And improvise.

12:47.058 --> 12:49.478
You do not need prayers.

12:49.853 --> 12:52.522
It's nice to work with someone like you.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.358
You'll complement each other.

12:55.525 --> 12:56.318
Colonel Bart.

12:56.443 --> 12:59.529
Please show Condor the key to the base.

13:01.865 --> 13:04.785
Baron will keep it in the meantime.

13:05.368 --> 13:06.870
It's been 40 years.

13:06.995 --> 13:07.746
Will the gold still be there?

13:07.913 --> 13:09.353
The key has been with the government.

13:09.372 --> 13:10.916
No one can get in.

13:11.041 --> 13:12.417
Even the Pharaoh's pyramid.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.002
Tomb raiders don't need keys.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.505
The location of the base is classified.

13:16.588 --> 13:18.131
Not accessible to laymen.

13:19.216 --> 13:21.551
One more question.

13:21.676 --> 13:22.594
Yes?

13:22.719 --> 13:23.678
About this mission

13:23.804 --> 13:25.931
I'm supposed to work with Condor.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.224
Should we disagree.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.142
Who has the final say?

13:29.309 --> 13:30.393
What do you suggest?

13:31.311 --> 13:32.311
I don't mind.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.022
Then I'll call the shots.

13:34.689 --> 13:36.775
Wait at the Library tomorrow at 10 a.m.

13:36.942 --> 13:37.692
I wanted to...

13:37.776 --> 13:39.110
I call the shots.

13:39.361 --> 13:40.362
Tomorrow morning at 'IO

13:40.904 --> 13:41.863
I want a word with them

13:41.905 --> 13:42.405
I'll excuse myself.

13:42.572 --> 13:43.365
Fine

13:45.200 --> 13:45.742
I'll see you at start off.

13:45.909 --> 13:46.409
Alright.

13:46.451 --> 13:47.132
See you tomorrow.

13:48.578 --> 13:49.412
Bye

13:50.789 --> 13:52.749
I've prepared the data.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.419
Rejections can be invigorating

13:56.753 --> 13:57.921
I agree.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.657
What do you know about the desert?

13:59.673 --> 14:00.298
Very sandy.

14:00.382 --> 14:03.592
Wrong! Only 25% of the Sahara

14:03.593 --> 14:04.636
ls covered with sand.

14:04.678 --> 14:06.847
The daytime temperature is 60 centigrade.

14:06.972 --> 14:08.598
But down to -5 centigrade at night.

14:08.723 --> 14:10.350
No rainfall for years.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.018
On water alone with no food.

14:12.185 --> 14:12.986
You can last 7 days.

14:13.144 --> 14:15.647
Without it, you'll be dead in 2 days.

14:17.274 --> 14:18.525
Have you been listening?

14:19.776 --> 14:21.778
Look at this photo.

14:23.363 --> 14:24.656
This is the aide.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.908
In charge of the mission.

14:27.033 --> 14:30.579
Looks like he had descendants.

14:30.745 --> 14:31.746
Who live around here.

14:34.165 --> 14:35.208
What are you doing?

14:35.375 --> 14:36.459
I want to take a look.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.087
The Germans have already checked.

14:39.254 --> 14:40.630
They found nothing.

14:40.839 --> 14:43.300
Are we done with the lesson? I must go!

14:46.261 --> 14:50.015
Wait! What about the water problem?

16:30.573 --> 16:32.158
It's her!

17:00.437 --> 17:01.688
I'll take my chance!

17:47.525 --> 17:49.401
Who are you?

17:49.402 --> 17:52.447
Go away! Leave!

17:53.823 --> 17:54.949
Come back!

17:57.660 --> 17:59.162
Help!

18:00.413 --> 18:03.208
I won't hurt you if you keep quiet!

18:03.333 --> 18:06.252
What do you want? Money?

18:06.336 --> 18:08.296
No! Just relax!

18:08.463 --> 18:09.380
I'm here for...

18:13.468 --> 18:14.803
Don't worry, I'll help you.

18:20.517 --> 18:21.518
Who are you?

18:21.601 --> 18:22.267
Who are you?

18:22.268 --> 18:23.561
I'm asking you.

18:23.895 --> 18:25.312
Me? I'm here to save you.

18:25.313 --> 18:26.814
Who are you?

18:26.815 --> 18:27.815
Let me ask him first!

18:27.816 --> 18:28.566
Who are you!

18:28.900 --> 18:31.361
Don't move! Or I'll shoot!

18:33.947 --> 18:35.240
Who we are is not your concern.

18:35.365 --> 18:36.533
We just want the gold.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.743
You followed us here for the gold?

18:39.244 --> 18:40.328
Ask her!

18:41.621 --> 18:42.872
You must be the one.

18:43.039 --> 18:45.291
Making those prank calls.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.710
You're Hans' grand-daughter.

18:47.877 --> 18:50.046
Talk or I'll kill you

18:51.256 --> 18:53.258
I'm against violence

18:54.092 --> 18:55.385
I haven't even started

18:55.635 --> 18:58.096
I just want to know where the gold is.

18:58.805 --> 18:59.889
You're making a threat.

19:00.181 --> 19:01.141
They'll think we're terrorists.

19:01.307 --> 19:01.891
Understand?

19:02.016 --> 19:03.101
Shut up!

19:04.144 --> 19:06.062
Let's not argue in front of them.

19:06.729 --> 19:08.356
Tell me where the gold is.

19:09.357 --> 19:11.651
Or I'll kill your boyfriend.

19:12.110 --> 19:13.528
He's not my boyfriend.

19:13.695 --> 19:15.321
That's right! I'm not.

19:15.446 --> 19:18.116
It's none of my business. Bye.

19:18.408 --> 19:22.620
Then what are you doing here?

19:24.038 --> 19:25.665
I saw the "For Sale" sign.

19:25.790 --> 19:27.292
Came here to take a look.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.252
Then I heard someone in the shower

19:29.460 --> 19:30.920
I wanted to take a look at that too

19:31.129 --> 19:32.422
I saw everything.

19:32.589 --> 19:33.298
Sorry!

19:33.423 --> 19:34.215
You want to see?

19:49.314 --> 19:50.273
Don't move!

19:52.066 --> 19:53.359
Who else are in your group?

19:54.027 --> 19:55.153
What's the plan?

19:56.112 --> 19:57.154
I won't tell you!

19:57.155 --> 19:59.281
Avenging warriors will not talk

19:59.282 --> 20:00.658
Allah is with us!

20:04.329 --> 20:05.788
Long live the avenging warriors.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.170
Save it for next time!

20:12.337 --> 20:13.630
Don't mess up the room.

20:13.671 --> 20:14.714
Now get lost!

20:16.966 --> 20:18.801
Stop hassling her.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.136
We won't give up.

20:20.345 --> 20:21.888
Justice is on our side.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.421
Other than tearing off my towel.

20:26.517 --> 20:27.977
You have no other plan?

20:29.479 --> 20:31.147
This is more effective.

20:45.703 --> 20:47.163
Good morning, Mr. Anderson.

20:47.872 --> 20:49.165
Good morning

20:49.374 --> 20:52.168
I heard you're the best
locksmith in Europe.

20:52.669 --> 20:53.962
Please take a look at this.

20:54.045 --> 20:55.380
Let me see.

20:59.217 --> 21:01.386
This key has 3 sections.

21:01.511 --> 21:03.638
Some are insulated.

21:03.763 --> 21:05.390
Which means when you open the lock.

21:05.556 --> 21:08.393
It'll trigger an electronic device.

21:08.559 --> 21:11.604
The design of the handle has its own use.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.064
Is that a trap?

21:13.231 --> 21:14.857
It needs a code.

21:15.024 --> 21:18.278
You can change it each time you close it.

21:19.696 --> 21:22.114
Only the last user knows the code.

21:22.115 --> 21:23.449
Come again if you can't open it.

21:24.158 --> 21:25.451
Thank you.

21:31.541 --> 21:33.459
Why did you...

21:36.838 --> 21:38.006
Follow me?

21:45.722 --> 21:48.808
Empty your pockets, hurry!

21:50.893 --> 21:53.021
Not those! The key!

22:26.888 --> 22:27.764
Get out of the way.

22:28.264 --> 22:29.057
It's him!

22:29.182 --> 22:30.099
Move the car!

22:39.942 --> 22:40.860
Grab him!

22:53.289 --> 22:54.332
Move!

23:03.132 --> 23:04.300
Over there!

23:07.678 --> 23:08.679
Make way!

23:17.313 --> 23:19.399
Watch out for the painting!

23:21.234 --> 23:23.736
It goes on auction tomorrow!

23:25.655 --> 23:26.656
My painting!

23:27.115 --> 23:28.157
What should we do?

23:40.795 --> 23:42.171
Give me back my paint!

23:44.924 --> 23:46.008
You asshole.

23:47.718 --> 23:49.011
One more!

23:54.100 --> 23:55.268
Turn around! Hurry!

23:57.895 --> 23:58.688
Upfront!

24:12.076 --> 24:13.202
My baby!

24:13.327 --> 24:15.788
Let me go! I have to save my baby!

24:17.039 --> 24:18.624
Help!

24:18.833 --> 24:21.919
He's trapped in traffic! Help!

24:24.130 --> 24:25.381
Help my son!

24:25.465 --> 24:26.424
Don't!

24:44.984 --> 24:46.068
Here he is!

24:49.030 --> 24:50.072
Baby!

24:50.198 --> 24:51.073
Jerk!

25:06.631 --> 25:07.381
Over here!

25:39.413 --> 25:40.164
Run over him!

25:51.300 --> 25:51.800
Stop him!

25:51.842 --> 25:52.760
Stop him...

26:22.206 --> 26:23.666
You won't get away!

26:32.425 --> 26:35.428
Your share is 1% of the treasure.

26:35.595 --> 26:36.387
That's not much!

26:36.512 --> 26:37.263
It's a lot!

26:37.346 --> 26:39.307
There are 240 tons of gold

26:39.432 --> 26:41.350
1% is already 2.5 tons.

26:41.851 --> 26:43.644
If I live long enough to enjoy it.

26:43.811 --> 26:45.855
They have come after me already.

26:46.022 --> 26:47.565
An old score perhaps?

26:47.648 --> 26:50.651
No! They came for the key!

26:50.860 --> 26:52.236
You think you're in Africa.

26:52.361 --> 26:54.363
For the lions and tigers?

26:58.326 --> 26:59.160
Please wait!

27:02.288 --> 27:03.580
You have more information?

27:03.581 --> 27:05.957
I've decided to go with you.

27:05.958 --> 27:06.751
This is...

27:07.043 --> 27:08.794
Elsa's grandfather is the aide.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.129
Pretty girl!

27:10.254 --> 27:10.880
How are you?

27:11.047 --> 27:13.591
I hope to find the truth
about grandpa's disappearance.

27:13.758 --> 27:16.886
Can I come with you, please?

27:17.053 --> 27:17.887
No problem!

27:18.012 --> 27:19.388
I'm not so sure.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.432
This is not a grand tour of Africa.

27:21.641 --> 27:22.600
Besides, she is...

27:22.683 --> 27:25.394
Closely related to the aide, I'm...

27:25.561 --> 27:26.242
I know grandpa...

27:26.354 --> 27:28.564
did not disappear
because he wanted to keep the gold

27:28.689 --> 27:31.776
I can prove it if you let me come.

27:31.942 --> 27:33.402
Fine, I'll keep an eye on her.

27:33.569 --> 27:36.781
We agreed that I call the shots.

27:37.031 --> 27:39.283
Ada, maybe the young lady.

27:39.408 --> 27:42.078
Can be helpful to our mission.

27:42.203 --> 27:44.080
Let me decide. You should go together.

27:44.538 --> 27:45.414
Very well.

27:46.957 --> 27:47.750
Thank you so much

27:47.917 --> 27:49.251
I'll leave the car here.

27:49.460 --> 27:50.169
Bye.

27:51.879 --> 27:52.713
Thank you.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.132
Good luck!

27:59.804 --> 28:01.472
Bye.

28:16.570 --> 28:18.072
Traveling together.

28:18.364 --> 28:23.911
On this long journey.

28:24.370 --> 28:27.914
Rushing towards the sun

28:27.915 --> 28:32.044
I open my heart to show my sincerity.

28:32.336 --> 28:34.088
Traveling together.

28:34.338 --> 28:40.052
We search for a new route.

28:40.302 --> 28:43.888
Marching along happily.

28:43.889 --> 28:48.269
Singing along the way.

28:56.360 --> 29:01.907
Like condors we soar through the sky.

29:04.452 --> 29:10.458
You and me flying high.

29:12.084 --> 29:19.592
Looking into the sun we're energetic.

29:20.384 --> 29:26.807
We shall overcome all hurdles.

29:28.392 --> 29:34.356
Challenging fate for a better day

29:36.400 --> 29:38.986
I show my admiration in the sand.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.489
May Allah watch over you.

29:41.614 --> 29:42.990
We thank your Allah.

29:46.577 --> 29:48.871
How is the food tonight?

29:49.038 --> 29:49.663
Not bad!

29:49.789 --> 29:51.350
Are you looking for gold in the desert?

29:51.373 --> 29:52.458
Do we look like we are?

29:52.583 --> 29:54.502
I've never heard of gold in the desert!

29:54.668 --> 29:56.754
No? What a shame...

29:57.129 --> 29:58.172
I'll leave you alone.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.925
They seem to know about the gold.

30:02.134 --> 30:04.303
Where do you think is the real map?

30:04.804 --> 30:06.180
You're nosy.

30:06.347 --> 30:09.517
The guards must have kept it.

30:09.683 --> 30:13.145
They disappeared, probably dead by now.

30:13.312 --> 30:15.064
Disappeared doesn't mean dead.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.483
If not, where are they now?

30:17.608 --> 30:20.194
Maybe they want to steal the gold.

30:20.361 --> 30:21.445
They're colluding secretly.

30:21.570 --> 30:22.905
To find the gold?

30:23.364 --> 30:26.408
Maybe some of them are colluding.

30:26.575 --> 30:28.077
Others are acting alone.

30:28.244 --> 30:30.579
Or getting their relatives involved.

30:30.746 --> 30:31.664
You mean

30:31.831 --> 30:33.916
I'm working undercover for grandpa?

30:34.083 --> 30:35.751
I didn't say that.

30:35.876 --> 30:37.962
The first time you saw me.

30:38.087 --> 30:38.807
You didn't like me

30:38.838 --> 30:41.090
I'm sorry you feel that way.

30:42.925 --> 30:44.635
Let's not argue in public.

30:44.802 --> 30:46.637
It's embarrassing.

30:46.804 --> 30:49.849
Why aren't you eating? No appetite?

30:50.015 --> 30:51.559
You haven't touched your food!

30:51.725 --> 30:53.394
I'm not hungry. Excuse me!

30:53.936 --> 30:54.436
Well?

30:54.478 --> 30:56.272
Give me the bill and clear the table.

30:56.397 --> 30:57.231
You're not eating?

30:57.565 --> 30:58.107
No!

30:58.190 --> 31:01.569
Such a waste! Give it to them!

31:02.194 --> 31:03.070
We came together.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.113
Don't be like this.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.740
You came with her, not me

31:06.824 --> 31:07.741
I'll be in my room

31:10.244 --> 31:11.120
Jackie.

31:11.912 --> 31:12.412
Yes?

31:12.413 --> 31:13.414
Come with me.

31:14.123 --> 31:15.249
Good night.

31:21.130 --> 31:22.047
Anything missing?

31:22.131 --> 31:23.382
Don't know yet.

31:24.216 --> 31:25.759
Look at my tapes!

31:25.885 --> 31:26.677
Jackie.

31:27.219 --> 31:27.970
What?

31:28.137 --> 31:31.098
Someone searched my room.

31:37.062 --> 31:39.732
Look at the mess.

31:40.524 --> 31:42.651
Luckily I put away the key.

31:42.776 --> 31:44.278
You should put these away too!

31:58.459 --> 31:59.752
Who did this?

32:00.252 --> 32:02.421
Good question! You came up first!

32:02.546 --> 32:03.547
Did you see anything?

32:04.006 --> 32:06.425
You mean I did this?

32:06.592 --> 32:09.094
You said it, I didn't!

32:09.345 --> 32:11.722
They went through my things too.

32:12.556 --> 32:15.059
A thief crying thief.

32:17.728 --> 32:19.521
You're welcome to go through my things.

32:20.397 --> 32:22.274
You obviously don't have what you want.

32:22.399 --> 32:24.276
Or else you won't be here with your act

32:28.656 --> 32:29.739
Elsa

32:29.740 --> 32:30.573
Jackie.

32:30.574 --> 32:31.200
Yes?

32:32.284 --> 32:34.411
Your room is too small.

32:34.536 --> 32:35.746
You can sleep in my room.

32:35.871 --> 32:37.623
And don't forget your sleeping bag.

32:37.831 --> 32:39.083
My room is not that big.

32:39.249 --> 32:40.876
But enough for 3.

32:42.044 --> 32:43.524
You're used to a big room by yourself

32:43.545 --> 32:46.632
African vampires don't
mess with Chinese women.

33:00.104 --> 33:01.814
You don't have to leave on her account

33:01.939 --> 33:03.816
I'll straighten her out.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.445
You go first.

33:10.364 --> 33:11.448
You're stepping on my hand.

33:11.615 --> 33:13.616
It'll only make things worse.

33:13.617 --> 33:15.786
So careless! Go on up!

33:31.844 --> 33:34.304
This is worse than plowing the fields.

33:36.140 --> 33:38.017
Go easy on her.

33:38.142 --> 33:39.977
Lock the door! I'll be right back

33:40.352 --> 33:41.145
I will.

34:09.840 --> 34:11.175
Please! Not now!

34:30.360 --> 34:32.987
I'll kill you... don't you run away!

34:34.697 --> 34:37.159
Serve you right!

34:40.913 --> 34:41.705
Oh, it's you!

34:42.915 --> 34:44.041
Yes!

34:44.208 --> 34:45.626
I know you've wanted to hit me.

34:45.793 --> 34:47.878
But look before you do.

34:48.003 --> 34:49.670
Yes, I wanted to hit you.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.632
And yes, I've looked.

34:53.675 --> 34:54.675
Your friend?

34:54.676 --> 34:55.719
Search her bags.

34:56.887 --> 35:00.057
Again! I just put everything back!

35:00.974 --> 35:03.060
- Good night!
- Thanks.

35:03.143 --> 35:03.936
Chocolate.

35:04.061 --> 35:05.104
Thanks.

35:05.229 --> 35:08.065
Good night.

35:09.316 --> 35:12.569
Room service...

35:16.156 --> 35:17.282
Good evening.

35:17.699 --> 35:18.492
What is it?

35:18.575 --> 35:20.702
Chocolate! Sleep well.

35:22.204 --> 35:24.288
Chocolate? Can't sleep!

35:24.289 --> 35:25.249
Can't sleep?

35:27.376 --> 35:28.836
Go away! We can't sleep.

35:35.050 --> 35:36.093
Condom.

35:36.552 --> 35:37.678
Condom?

35:37.886 --> 35:40.597
Sleep well.

35:46.186 --> 35:48.605
Great! Condom!

35:51.441 --> 35:52.568
Magic.

35:53.485 --> 35:54.778
Magic.

35:55.612 --> 35:56.947
Great magic

35:58.073 --> 36:01.660
I won't disturb you, good night.

36:03.162 --> 36:06.415
Let me know if you need anything.

36:10.252 --> 36:11.753
Good night.

36:11.920 --> 36:12.754
Ada.

36:14.173 --> 36:16.633
Go away! I don't want to see you!

36:16.758 --> 36:18.093
Go! Hurry!

36:18.218 --> 36:19.887
Why are you always like this?

36:20.053 --> 36:21.889
No reason! Leave!

36:22.514 --> 36:23.223
Jackie.

36:23.390 --> 36:24.141
Don't come over.

36:24.391 --> 36:25.142
Jackie's busy.

36:25.267 --> 36:26.935
Did you tell her?

36:29.104 --> 36:32.316
I was busy. I have things to do.

36:32.441 --> 36:33.400
Go away!

36:33.525 --> 36:36.528
Busy? What are you <i>2</i> doing?

36:37.112 --> 36:38.155
What is this?

36:38.363 --> 36:40.907
Why else will I dress like this?

36:40.908 --> 36:42.034
What's going on?

36:42.618 --> 36:44.161
Go away! We can't wait!

36:44.286 --> 36:46.788
Go away! Get it?

36:49.458 --> 36:51.043
You're gross.

36:51.877 --> 36:52.961
Go away!

36:59.968 --> 37:01.511
Hand it over!

37:01.762 --> 37:03.013
Don't play dumb.

37:03.805 --> 37:04.932
Where is it?

37:05.265 --> 37:06.183
Where is what?

37:11.188 --> 37:12.356
Stop! Don't beat him up!

37:12.481 --> 37:14.107
Just tell me what you want.

37:14.399 --> 37:16.318
The map and the key.

37:17.277 --> 37:19.320
The map and the key

37:19.321 --> 37:20.614
I have neither.

37:25.827 --> 37:26.828
Stop!

37:26.995 --> 37:29.373
Tell us or I'll kill him

37:29.998 --> 37:31.792
I really don't know.

37:33.710 --> 37:36.338
Stop!

37:36.797 --> 37:39.841
Can't you beat on her?

37:40.092 --> 37:43.345
I may feel sorry for her and tell you.

37:50.269 --> 37:53.146
Alright, it's in his underwear.

37:54.439 --> 37:55.565
Don't you believe her?

38:00.445 --> 38:02.739
I'll take your towel if you won't talk.

38:03.740 --> 38:06.242
Hear that? He'll take my towel!

38:06.243 --> 38:06.909
Good!

38:06.910 --> 38:07.576
What?

38:07.577 --> 38:09.579
I've wanted to see

38:11.957 --> 38:13.792
Jackie! He's taking it off!

38:15.502 --> 38:17.254
Don't move!

38:17.421 --> 38:18.505
I told you not to move!

38:23.552 --> 38:24.386
Open your mouth.

38:31.935 --> 38:33.228
Sleep well.

38:45.782 --> 38:46.616
Don't move!

38:51.663 --> 38:53.373
Room service.

38:53.457 --> 38:54.583
Come in.

39:01.965 --> 39:02.966
What is this?

39:04.134 --> 39:08.221
Baked chicken.

39:08.764 --> 39:10.766
Special recipe.

39:12.100 --> 39:12.976
Baked chicken.

39:16.605 --> 39:18.899
Enjoy it! Bye!

39:24.196 --> 39:25.113
Don't move!

39:25.781 --> 39:27.407
Freeze or I'll shoot.

39:27.949 --> 39:31.620
Great! I knew you can do it.

39:32.496 --> 39:34.748
You're smart to come back!

39:34.915 --> 39:36.917
You understood my hint!

39:37.042 --> 39:39.878
Of course! I'm clever.

39:40.212 --> 39:42.339
This is for taking my towel!

39:42.464 --> 39:43.965
I'm beginning to like you.

39:44.132 --> 39:46.551
Same here.

39:48.053 --> 39:48.929
Kill him

39:51.306 --> 39:52.474
Jackie, what are you doing?

39:54.309 --> 39:55.977
What's with all the tape?

39:56.144 --> 39:57.646
So that it won't fall out!

39:57.771 --> 39:58.355
Go over there!

39:58.480 --> 39:59.272
Sorry!

40:02.651 --> 40:03.693
I told you not to come in.

40:03.860 --> 40:05.112
We don't want to hurt anyone.

40:05.278 --> 40:06.488
But we don't mind doing it.

40:06.613 --> 40:08.156
Hand over the map and the key

40:08.323 --> 40:11.993
I don't have it. You've searched the room.

40:12.160 --> 40:13.703
Do I look like I'm lying?

40:14.454 --> 40:16.248
Can't help it if you don't believe me.

40:16.498 --> 40:18.834
Even if you kill us, we
still don't have it.

40:19.543 --> 40:20.794
Quit your act

40:20.961 --> 40:25.048
I'll count to 3 then
I'll kill you one by one

40:26.716 --> 40:27.509
Jackie.

40:31.513 --> 40:32.722
Stop staring!

40:32.848 --> 40:33.728
Why tear off my towel?

40:33.765 --> 40:34.975
I know what she's doing.

40:35.892 --> 40:36.726
Why did you hit me?

40:36.852 --> 40:37.973
Because you're staring at me.

40:37.978 --> 40:39.458
So did they, why didn't you hit them?

40:39.688 --> 40:40.271
You!

40:40.272 --> 40:41.106
Stop wasting time!

40:41.898 --> 40:42.774
Start with her!

40:43.733 --> 40:44.860
Me?

40:49.698 --> 40:50.782
Talk!

40:53.160 --> 40:53.952
<i>2.</i>

40:54.578 --> 40:55.662
Well?

40:57.038 --> 40:59.124
Wait! I'll tell you.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.543
You can't tell them.

41:01.710 --> 41:02.961
You told me to.

41:03.420 --> 41:04.796
It won't work even if I tell you.

41:04.921 --> 41:07.048
My friends are here. You won't get away.

41:07.674 --> 41:08.675
Really?

41:09.885 --> 41:10.760
You don't believe me?

41:10.927 --> 41:12.179
You can come out now!

41:31.031 --> 41:31.781
Catch!

41:33.700 --> 41:35.076
Don't let go no matter what!

41:41.541 --> 41:43.001
Don't move!

41:43.251 --> 41:44.169
I have the bullets.

41:45.670 --> 41:46.421
Here!

41:49.591 --> 41:50.258
Back to you!

41:50.383 --> 41:51.583
There's still one bullet left!

42:03.480 --> 42:04.773
Ada, where are you going?

42:05.524 --> 42:06.942
Take this to safety.

42:07.609 --> 42:09.069
Where are you taking it?

42:15.617 --> 42:16.952
Robbery!

42:17.327 --> 42:18.203
What should I do?

42:18.745 --> 42:19.621
Knock him out!

42:23.625 --> 42:25.502
Help! Robbery!

42:25.961 --> 42:28.088
Stop him! He took my things!

42:28.672 --> 42:29.839
Please stop him!

42:30.173 --> 42:32.092
Robbery!

42:32.425 --> 42:34.761
How can you just watch?

42:35.178 --> 42:36.638
Make way...

42:48.024 --> 42:48.524
Well?

42:48.650 --> 42:49.401
Go away!

42:56.616 --> 42:57.367
Help!

42:57.492 --> 42:58.159
Ada.

42:58.285 --> 42:59.244
Catch!

43:01.997 --> 43:03.039
What?

43:06.710 --> 43:09.504
Help! Someone is after me!

43:09.629 --> 43:11.923
Please stop him.

43:12.048 --> 43:14.551
Help! Here he is!

43:22.851 --> 43:23.643
L'£'S gone!

43:24.936 --> 43:25.854
The key is down there

43:25.979 --> 43:26.980
I know.

43:27.230 --> 43:27.856
What happened?

43:28.023 --> 43:29.357
Robbers!

43:36.323 --> 43:38.074
Ada, did you get the key?

43:43.204 --> 43:45.373
Down there! Hurry!

43:53.715 --> 43:55.174
Are you alright? Are you hurt?

43:55.175 --> 43:56.634
Over there! Go get it!

43:56.635 --> 43:57.636
I know.

43:58.928 --> 44:00.096
Pick it up, quick!

44:00.680 --> 44:01.681
Another one is coming!

44:01.765 --> 44:03.141
Here they come!

44:04.017 --> 44:05.477
I can't move!

44:07.479 --> 44:08.647
Let me...

44:09.731 --> 44:10.899
How clumsy!

44:11.816 --> 44:13.026
Don't come down!

44:13.276 --> 44:15.195
Stay there! Let me pick it up!

44:15.320 --> 44:16.404
It'll collapse!

44:21.117 --> 44:23.870
Want your towel back?

44:26.748 --> 44:27.791
Well? Are you alright?

44:27.916 --> 44:28.416
I'm fine.

44:28.583 --> 44:29.709
Don't go away!

44:30.585 --> 44:31.419
Look up!

44:31.544 --> 44:32.754
I know.

44:33.463 --> 44:34.214
Where's the key?

44:34.339 --> 44:35.340
There!

44:35.757 --> 44:37.133
Don't worry, I'm here.

44:38.301 --> 44:39.302
Where are the robbers?

44:39.594 --> 44:40.845
Over there.

44:42.764 --> 44:45.225
It's them. Shoot!

44:45.392 --> 44:46.432
My friends are down there.

44:46.476 --> 44:48.770
Money. No money no shoot.

44:51.731 --> 44:52.524
Deal.

44:52.649 --> 44:54.275
All yours! Shoot!

44:54.442 --> 44:55.235
What?

44:55.360 --> 44:56.653
It's yours now.

45:09.290 --> 45:10.250
Come back!

45:30.478 --> 45:32.272
Powerful enough?

45:53.501 --> 45:54.669
Let's go back to the room.

45:54.794 --> 45:55.587
Fine!

45:56.588 --> 45:57.672
Where are you going?

45:58.590 --> 46:00.300
I go this way. Where are you going?

46:01.760 --> 46:03.011
That way.

46:03.678 --> 46:04.804
Left foot.

46:30.246 --> 46:31.039
Let's go.

46:31.873 --> 46:35.084
Welcome! May Allah bless you.

46:35.210 --> 46:37.003
How many rooms do you need?

46:37.212 --> 46:40.173
A Chinese was here last night.

46:40.256 --> 46:41.466
Where is he now?

46:42.175 --> 46:43.968
Without money, I'm in no mood to talk.

46:44.093 --> 46:46.554
No money no talk, understand?

46:48.973 --> 46:52.227
They left early this morning.

46:52.310 --> 46:53.144
Where to?

46:53.269 --> 46:54.687
The desert.

46:54.896 --> 46:56.147
Don't mind him, let's go

46:58.441 --> 47:00.235
Allah will punish you!

47:45.488 --> 47:46.447
Follow them!

47:59.502 --> 48:01.920
Small world! We meet again.

48:01.921 --> 48:02.922
Momoko, you're going to the desert.

48:03.006 --> 48:04.465
To find the meaning of death?

48:04.632 --> 48:05.550
Why?

48:05.717 --> 48:06.634
We're alive now.

48:06.801 --> 48:07.927
We will die but we don't know why.

48:08.052 --> 48:09.137
So I come to the desert.

48:09.304 --> 48:10.054
That's true.

48:10.179 --> 48:12.348
The desert is closest to death.

48:12.473 --> 48:14.601
What are you talking about?

48:14.726 --> 48:16.769
Do you understand, Jackie?

48:17.186 --> 48:19.606
If you don't understand, how could I?

48:19.731 --> 48:21.733
I know water and life are precious.

48:21.900 --> 48:22.901
Don't waste it.

48:23.067 --> 48:26.738
You must also pamper your skin

48:26.988 --> 48:30.825
I hate sun burns.

48:34.495 --> 48:35.747
What are you doing?

48:36.497 --> 48:37.665
Scorpion!

48:42.921 --> 48:44.297
L'£'S gone!

48:46.674 --> 48:49.802
A grown man afraid of scorpions?

48:50.678 --> 48:51.845
There's one behind you!

48:51.846 --> 48:52.889
Help!

48:52.931 --> 48:54.307
There's a scorpion!

48:54.724 --> 48:55.974
What should I do? It's on me!

48:55.975 --> 48:56.726
Ada.

48:56.935 --> 48:59.102
Go get help! Hurry!

48:59.103 --> 49:01.146
Damn! Catch it for me!

49:01.147 --> 49:02.857
Go get help! Hurry!

49:02.982 --> 49:05.151
Momoko, be careful! It's poisonous!

49:05.526 --> 49:06.819
Don't worry, it's mine.

49:08.613 --> 49:11.658
Where is it? Can't get rid of it!

49:14.243 --> 49:16.663
Meet Ding Dong, my pet.

49:16.871 --> 49:19.415
It won't bite if you leave it alone.

49:19.540 --> 49:21.250
Sorry about scaring you.

49:26.881 --> 49:32.053
The moon is beautiful. I go to bed now.

50:00.164 --> 50:01.082
NOW!

50:03.626 --> 50:04.794
Don't move!

50:13.720 --> 50:14.929
What are you doing?

50:15.221 --> 50:15.888
Help!

50:28.317 --> 50:29.193
Stop!

50:29.861 --> 50:32.030
You hit me!

50:32.155 --> 50:32.947
Give me the gun!

50:33.865 --> 50:35.825
Let go of me!

50:35.950 --> 50:37.744
Shut up or I'll hit you.

50:42.248 --> 50:43.249
Give it to me.

51:02.769 --> 51:03.644
What kind of scorpion is that?

51:03.811 --> 51:04.937
Scorpion King, maybe

51:07.398 --> 51:09.108
I'll finish you up.

51:15.823 --> 51:19.494
Drive away! Hurry!

51:28.461 --> 51:29.837
They're gone!

51:31.798 --> 51:33.341
Are you alright?

51:33.633 --> 51:34.550
I'm fine.

51:36.135 --> 51:37.303
No! Ding Dong!

51:39.806 --> 51:40.556
Not so hard.

51:40.681 --> 51:41.682
Are you alright?

51:41.808 --> 51:43.893
We're fine but John had it bad.

51:44.018 --> 51:45.061
Who are they?

51:45.394 --> 51:47.021
Bandits.

51:47.188 --> 51:48.606
Take me to them at dawn.

51:48.689 --> 51:50.858
No, we don't want trouble

51:51.025 --> 51:53.778
I'll take you. I know the area.

51:53.861 --> 51:56.531
Let me bury Ding Dong first.

51:57.657 --> 51:58.866
Sure.

52:23.683 --> 52:25.351
This is crowded like a market.

52:25.518 --> 52:29.230
It's a slave market. Starts at sunset.

52:29.856 --> 52:31.440
We'll act at night fall.

52:39.740 --> 52:41.576
Once.

52:41.951 --> 52:43.286
Twice.

52:43.619 --> 52:46.122
Thrice. Sold!

52:46.664 --> 52:49.750
Now is tonight's climax.

52:49.792 --> 52:50.626
We have here the epitome of beauty.

52:50.751 --> 52:51.502
Rope!

52:51.919 --> 52:53.212
Watch this!

52:53.754 --> 52:56.841
An Aryan blonde.

52:56.966 --> 52:59.010
An Oriental Sex Kitten.

52:59.135 --> 53:02.096
This is your chance of a lifetime.

53:02.722 --> 53:05.474
Her big buttocks means she's prolific.

53:05.641 --> 53:06.851
She has exquisite skin.

53:06.976 --> 53:08.769
Minimum bid is 10 camels

53:09.645 --> 53:10.605
15 once

53:11.772 --> 53:13.274
20 once.

53:14.984 --> 53:16.319
Can you drive?

53:16.527 --> 53:17.862
I just learn 3rd gear.

53:17.987 --> 53:19.739
That's good enough.

53:22.116 --> 53:23.117
Someone's coming.

53:30.708 --> 53:31.918
Who are you?

53:39.508 --> 53:40.259
Sorry!

53:43.638 --> 53:45.640
Can I choose? They're ugly.

53:45.806 --> 53:48.226
How come the ugly ones bid higher?

53:49.143 --> 53:49.644
60 once

53:50.645 --> 53:51.646
65 once.

53:51.812 --> 53:52.730
All yours!

53:52.855 --> 53:54.398
The chieftain's bid is 65 camels

53:54.607 --> 53:56.609
ls there a higher bid?

53:56.776 --> 53:58.027
65 once

53:58.152 --> 53:59.946
65 twice

54:01.614 --> 54:03.324
The bid is 70

54:03.491 --> 54:04.651
70 camels from the chieftain.

54:04.742 --> 54:05.660
Any higher bids?

54:06.661 --> 54:07.495
It's 75 now

54:08.537 --> 54:09.497
It's 80

54:10.831 --> 54:11.666
85 camels

54:12.541 --> 54:13.041
It's now 90

54:14.877 --> 54:15.419
100 camels!

54:16.170 --> 54:16.837
105 camels!

54:22.343 --> 54:23.052
150 camels!

54:23.219 --> 54:24.261
The bid is 150.

54:24.262 --> 54:25.930
- Forget it!
- Maybe next time!

54:26.138 --> 54:27.181
Any bids over 150?

54:27.306 --> 54:28.932
Which Chieftain has so many camels?

54:28.933 --> 54:29.392
Don't know.

54:29.393 --> 54:30.601
Any higher bids? 150 once

54:30.851 --> 54:31.894
150 twice

54:31.936 --> 54:33.354
150 thrice! Sold!

54:33.521 --> 54:35.022
Sir, please come forward.

54:35.398 --> 54:38.192
First gear, gas.

54:39.777 --> 54:40.611
Momoko, stay calm!

54:42.363 --> 54:46.325
Such exquisite skin!

54:46.867 --> 54:47.827
It's me, Jackie

54:49.120 --> 54:50.579
I'm here to rescue you.

54:52.206 --> 54:54.709
Pretty sex kitten!

54:55.543 --> 54:56.585
Blonde pussy!

54:56.711 --> 54:58.796
Marry this Chieftain.

54:58.963 --> 54:59.839
Don't touch me!

54:59.964 --> 55:00.881
I love it.

55:02.717 --> 55:03.926
Robbery!

55:04.051 --> 55:04.802
What happened?

55:04.927 --> 55:06.177
Someone stole my clothes.

55:06.178 --> 55:06.970
Who?

55:06.971 --> 55:07.804
It's Jackie.

55:07.805 --> 55:08.848
He stole my clothes!

55:09.140 --> 55:10.433
He's an imposter!

55:11.100 --> 55:11.851
Catch him!

55:15.396 --> 55:16.731
Quick! Jump down!

55:19.025 --> 55:19.900
Sorry!

55:20.026 --> 55:21.027
Are you alright?

55:21.193 --> 55:24.363
Start the car, first gear.

55:25.031 --> 55:25.948
Don't move.

55:27.116 --> 55:28.409
Gas!

55:30.369 --> 55:31.412
Oops! The hand brake!

55:48.387 --> 55:49.430
Go see what's going on!

55:49.555 --> 55:50.181
Yes!

55:58.814 --> 56:00.274
Hurry!

56:02.568 --> 56:03.986
That's not Ada!

56:05.071 --> 56:06.072
Help!

56:07.573 --> 56:08.491
Shut up!

56:09.784 --> 56:10.451
Good job!

56:10.534 --> 56:11.369
The car is outside, let's go!

56:11.494 --> 56:12.578
Here I am, where are you going?

56:12.703 --> 56:13.788
Come here! Hurry!

56:15.039 --> 56:16.040
Over here!

56:17.583 --> 56:18.376
Stop the car!

56:18.542 --> 56:19.710
Wait for me!

56:32.640 --> 56:34.141
It's too bumpy!

56:34.266 --> 56:36.394
Momoko, is this the right way?

56:36.560 --> 56:38.062
Did you learn how to drive?

56:38.187 --> 56:39.897
You're sitting on the gear shift!

56:40.064 --> 56:42.817
- You're crushing me!
- Turn!

58:01.228 --> 58:03.856
Thank Allah for bringing you to us.

58:06.025 --> 58:08.027
Take us to the base.

58:18.829 --> 58:20.915
Let's rest, I'm thirsty.

58:31.133 --> 58:33.802
Please give me some water.

58:34.261 --> 58:36.597
Please give them water.

58:36.680 --> 58:37.598
Can I give them water?

58:37.723 --> 58:38.516
No!

58:38.641 --> 58:40.643
Look after yourself first, you idiot!

58:40.935 --> 58:43.312
Please!

58:49.944 --> 58:53.948
Relax! We'll die together.

58:55.366 --> 58:57.451
Don't try anything, bitch!

58:57.618 --> 58:59.119
You sent us here on purpose!

58:59.286 --> 59:00.913
Even the sun's bearing is wrong.

59:01.205 --> 59:02.748
You're reading the map upside down.

59:02.957 --> 59:04.124
Let me see.

59:08.170 --> 59:09.964
You'll feel better if I hug you.

59:12.591 --> 59:13.759
Drink this!

59:18.097 --> 59:20.975
Be careful! Don't blow our cover!

59:25.479 --> 59:27.314
Enough! Let go!

59:29.858 --> 59:31.860
Let me give you a hug!

59:31.986 --> 59:33.195
I haven't had enough!

59:33.737 --> 59:37.283
Can't stand this intimacy!

59:37.533 --> 59:38.617
Let me give you a hug!

59:38.826 --> 59:39.660
Water!

59:41.787 --> 59:42.705
Slow down!

59:43.747 --> 59:44.915
Take your time.

59:45.583 --> 59:47.751
Thirst makes you horny.

59:51.505 --> 59:53.424
Let me hug you longer.

59:53.549 --> 59:55.342
Are you feverish?

59:55.801 --> 59:57.136
My 'turn!

59:59.263 --> 01:00:01.348
Enough!

01:00:05.644 --> 01:00:08.105
Don't do that! I don't need a hug.

01:00:08.230 --> 01:00:09.982
You'll know the difference.

01:00:11.358 --> 01:00:12.067
See?

01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:15.863
Are you done?

01:00:16.030 --> 01:00:17.156
Stay where you are!

01:00:17.281 --> 01:00:17.990
Let me hug you!

01:00:18.157 --> 01:00:19.950
Please don't come near me!

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:22.536
I don't like hugs and kisses.

01:00:22.703 --> 01:00:23.787
Let me hug you.

01:00:23.912 --> 01:00:25.039
Hug them, not me!

01:00:25.164 --> 01:00:27.041
You're pulling off my pants! Help!

01:00:27.374 --> 01:00:28.542
It'll be better if I hug you.

01:00:32.504 --> 01:00:33.631
Don't!

01:00:33.922 --> 01:00:36.717
You'll blow our cover! Let go!

01:00:39.928 --> 01:00:41.847
What do you think they're doing?

01:00:45.643 --> 01:00:48.979
Move your hands and feet!

01:00:51.565 --> 01:00:53.609
My turn! Hug me!

01:00:53.776 --> 01:00:55.194
Don't! You'll blow the cover!

01:00:55.319 --> 01:00:56.487
Just a bit longer...

01:00:56.862 --> 01:00:58.197
One by one! Watch out for them!

01:00:58.405 --> 01:00:59.406
I haven't had enough!

01:01:01.033 --> 01:01:02.326
Leave some for me!

01:01:06.121 --> 01:01:07.164
They saw us.

01:01:08.874 --> 01:01:09.750
Hand it over!

01:01:17.758 --> 01:01:19.038
If you try anything funny again.

01:01:19.093 --> 01:01:20.594
We'll kill all of you.

01:01:20.678 --> 01:01:21.595
Move!

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:25.307
There goes the water!

01:01:26.225 --> 01:01:28.394
Move! Stop sitting there!

01:01:38.862 --> 01:01:42.950
According to the map, this is the place.

01:01:43.283 --> 01:01:45.786
It'll take time to dig through the sand.

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.413
Are you sure?

01:01:47.663 --> 01:01:49.039
See for yourself!

01:01:50.999 --> 01:01:52.292
Give me the map.

01:01:52.459 --> 01:01:53.460
Let them take a look.

01:01:53.627 --> 01:01:54.628
Give it to me!

01:01:55.295 --> 01:01:56.505
Pass me the compass.

01:02:00.175 --> 01:02:01.510
You can turn it!

01:02:02.261 --> 01:02:04.304
It should be here.

01:02:05.347 --> 01:02:07.683
Sandstorms around here are most severe.

01:02:07.808 --> 01:02:10.436
The base could have been buried.

01:02:10.561 --> 01:02:12.646
Don't tell me this is the place.

01:02:12.771 --> 01:02:14.690
Yes! According to the bearing.

01:02:14.857 --> 01:02:16.316
Maybe the map is wrong.

01:02:16.442 --> 01:02:18.652
Military maps are highly accurate.

01:02:18.819 --> 01:02:20.259
Margin of error within 3 kilometers.

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.782
That's a huge difference already!

01:02:24.158 --> 01:02:26.994
Allah, show us the way!

01:02:27.953 --> 01:02:28.662
Armand!

01:02:28.746 --> 01:02:29.580
Don't move!

01:02:37.296 --> 01:02:38.088
Armand!

01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:42.760
Give them water.

01:02:46.472 --> 01:02:48.307
Don't ever want to see you again!

01:02:48.724 --> 01:02:49.308
Thanks.

01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:51.810
Thanks? That's our water!

01:02:52.770 --> 01:02:53.436
Let's go!

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:54.438
Bye!

01:02:55.355 --> 01:02:56.857
You won't get away with this!

01:02:57.024 --> 01:02:58.442
Allah will punish you!

01:03:09.161 --> 01:03:10.078
Don't come over!

01:03:20.547 --> 01:03:22.299
This is my biggest failure to date.

01:03:23.842 --> 01:03:24.927
Relish it!

01:03:25.260 --> 01:03:26.386
These are your photos?

01:03:27.471 --> 01:03:28.722
My grandpas

01:03:29.973 --> 01:03:31.642
I've been there before

01:03:31.934 --> 01:03:33.310
I know the tribesmen well.

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:35.062
This is their god

01:03:37.231 --> 01:03:37.951
I bought the doll.

01:03:38.065 --> 01:03:39.983
Because it looks like the statue.

01:03:40.108 --> 01:03:41.401
Look, Jackie.

01:03:43.862 --> 01:03:44.363
Judging from the photos.

01:03:44.488 --> 01:03:46.073
They must be taken near the base.

01:03:46.198 --> 01:03:47.241
Take us there.

01:03:48.659 --> 01:03:50.244
We haven't lost yet!

01:04:00.546 --> 01:04:02.339
We're here at last!

01:04:02.464 --> 01:04:03.298
Don't go there!

01:04:03.423 --> 01:04:05.592
A vicious tribe has taken over

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:07.594
I have yet to see someone truly vicious.

01:04:07.803 --> 01:04:08.971
You argue everything!

01:04:09.137 --> 01:04:10.681
Shut up and get in!

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:11.973
Thanks.

01:04:11.974 --> 01:04:12.724
Be careful!

01:04:12.933 --> 01:04:14.434
Thanks for taking us, bye!

01:04:15.769 --> 01:04:17.479
- Bye!
- Bye!

01:04:30.784 --> 01:04:31.618
What are you doing?

01:04:31.743 --> 01:04:33.245
Find out if it's hollow.

01:04:42.838 --> 01:04:44.381
This way

01:04:51.305 --> 01:04:53.974
Jackie, slow down! It's dark in here!

01:04:54.182 --> 01:04:55.767
Take off your glasses.

01:04:59.938 --> 01:05:01.607
You 2 go that way

01:05:01.732 --> 01:05:02.524
I go this way.

01:05:02.649 --> 01:05:03.692
Be careful!

01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:14.328
Jackie.

01:05:15.495 --> 01:05:17.080
Back so soon?

01:05:17.205 --> 01:05:18.081
Yes.

01:05:18.916 --> 01:05:19.750
Come.

01:05:22.210 --> 01:05:23.086
A skull.

01:05:24.379 --> 01:05:26.590
Relax, they're ox heads, not human.

01:05:26.673 --> 01:05:27.633
What are you doing?

01:05:27.799 --> 01:05:29.009
Something's flying this way.

01:05:29.134 --> 01:05:29.885
What is it?

01:05:30.636 --> 01:05:31.553
Skulls.

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:36.767
What?

01:05:36.892 --> 01:05:37.809
Let's go.

01:05:39.728 --> 01:05:41.355
Someone's coming! What now?

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:42.356
This way...

01:05:42.898 --> 01:05:43.899
Hurry!

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:46.568
Where are you going?

01:05:46.735 --> 01:05:47.444
Move!

01:05:51.740 --> 01:05:53.492
One at a time

01:05:54.117 --> 01:05:55.285
I'm falling.

01:05:58.038 --> 01:05:58.997
Over there!

01:06:07.464 --> 01:06:08.256
We're tourists.

01:06:08.382 --> 01:06:09.091
Tourists!

01:06:09.675 --> 01:06:10.842
It works. Take one more!

01:06:12.427 --> 01:06:13.470
Go!

01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:20.310
Dead end.

01:06:20.602 --> 01:06:21.645
What do we do now?

01:06:22.062 --> 01:06:22.604
One for each.

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:23.438
What's that for?

01:06:24.898 --> 01:06:25.816
Let's go!

01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:31.613
Can't knock him out.

01:06:31.822 --> 01:06:32.739
Hit harder.

01:06:32.823 --> 01:06:33.657
Now?

01:06:52.968 --> 01:06:53.760
Have you seen this before?

01:06:53.927 --> 01:06:55.095
Chinese kung fu?

01:07:03.603 --> 01:07:07.107
The dance is to make friends.

01:07:08.567 --> 01:07:10.819
Some tribes are like that.

01:07:10.986 --> 01:07:13.030
Let's dance with them.

01:07:16.450 --> 01:07:17.534
Left foot first.

01:07:39.264 --> 01:07:41.933
Wait! They're calling for help.

01:07:45.479 --> 01:07:46.521
What should we do now?

01:07:49.024 --> 01:07:50.108
Play by ear.

01:07:54.529 --> 01:07:55.781
Look at the skulls!

01:07:56.073 --> 01:07:57.240
Jump!

01:07:58.075 --> 01:07:59.242
Come on...

01:07:59.951 --> 01:08:01.369
Hurry!

01:08:05.248 --> 01:08:06.208
They stopped chasing us.

01:08:06.249 --> 01:08:07.876
Don't stop, let's go!

01:08:08.001 --> 01:08:09.169
They're getting help again?

01:08:09.628 --> 01:08:12.506
No, they don't need anymore help.

01:08:17.676 --> 01:08:18.595
What are you doing?

01:08:18.845 --> 01:08:20.013
Help me!

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:21.389
I'm sinking

01:08:46.706 --> 01:08:48.041
Jackie, where are you?

01:08:48.166 --> 01:08:50.335
Don't move! We're coming!

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.546
I'm not! Help!

01:08:52.671 --> 01:08:53.546
Where are we?

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:55.215
I don't know.

01:08:58.051 --> 01:08:59.010
What is that?

01:08:59.636 --> 01:09:00.511
A leg.

01:09:00.679 --> 01:09:04.474
- What?
- What happened?

01:09:04.599 --> 01:09:06.059
Nothing. Shut up!

01:09:06.225 --> 01:09:07.935
I'm scared.

01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:09.187
Don't be.

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:10.981
What now?

01:09:11.106 --> 01:09:13.733
It's German. No smoking in the base.

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:15.902
- What base?
- Don't know.

01:09:15.986 --> 01:09:17.154
Corning.

01:09:26.746 --> 01:09:27.788
Give me water.

01:09:28.247 --> 01:09:29.374
Hand it over.

01:09:31.585 --> 01:09:32.752
That's mine!

01:09:33.211 --> 01:09:34.129
What?

01:09:34.587 --> 01:09:35.589
Come here.

01:09:44.346 --> 01:09:46.433
This looks like a military base.

01:09:50.187 --> 01:09:51.395
Very dusty.

01:10:00.697 --> 01:10:02.115
It's grandpa!

01:10:04.659 --> 01:10:05.952
Are you sure?

01:10:06.119 --> 01:10:06.995
Don't move!

01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.038
He was murdered!

01:10:08.121 --> 01:10:08.830
How do you know?

01:10:08.955 --> 01:10:09.664
Look!

01:10:11.583 --> 01:10:12.709
You!

01:10:12.834 --> 01:10:13.877
Sorry!

01:10:22.636 --> 01:10:23.970
You recognize him?

01:10:24.262 --> 01:10:25.972
Yes!

01:10:27.933 --> 01:10:31.102
Don't be sad, he's been dead for years!

01:10:31.311 --> 01:10:32.896
I'm sad because I found out.

01:10:33.021 --> 01:10:34.814
He was murdered.

01:10:47.661 --> 01:10:48.912
What is that?

01:10:49.996 --> 01:10:51.206
A diary.

01:10:51.873 --> 01:10:53.291
Don't touch me!

01:10:54.751 --> 01:10:56.044
Read it!

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.838
This is grandpa's diary.

01:10:59.047 --> 01:11:00.548
Did he leave any word.

01:11:00.674 --> 01:11:02.425
About who killed him?

01:11:04.552 --> 01:11:06.263
"We covered 20 kilometers today

01:11:06.388 --> 01:11:07.722
4 men suffered sunstroke".

01:11:07.847 --> 01:11:09.182
Pick another page.

01:11:10.684 --> 01:11:12.602
"We are losing the war."

01:11:12.686 --> 01:11:15.689
But I'm confident we shall prevail.

01:11:15.855 --> 01:11:17.816
General Rommel.

01:11:17.941 --> 01:11:20.193
Is a military genius...

01:11:20.277 --> 01:11:22.028
Anything more relevant?

01:11:23.280 --> 01:11:25.699
"Heavy metal was shipped here today."

01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:28.743
The Count wanted them in Lab No. 'I.

01:11:28.910 --> 01:11:31.204
"Heavy metal? Must be gold!"

01:11:31.371 --> 01:11:32.455
This is about the gold.

01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:34.040
"The Count gave me 18 pills."

01:11:34.124 --> 01:11:36.543
One for each of them afterwards.

01:11:36.668 --> 01:11:38.503
We need a code to seal the base.

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:40.338
Perhaps I'll use Eliza's birthday...

01:11:40.463 --> 01:11:41.464
Who's Eliza?

01:11:41.631 --> 01:11:42.590
My mom.

01:11:42.716 --> 01:11:44.301
You remember her birthday?

01:11:44.426 --> 01:11:45.010
Yes.

01:11:45.135 --> 01:11:47.220
Why was grandpa so sad?

01:11:47.345 --> 01:11:47.971
Go on!

01:11:48.096 --> 01:11:49.222
I know why.

01:11:50.682 --> 01:11:52.100
If I'm not mistaken.

01:11:52.267 --> 01:11:54.019
Those are his personal guards.

01:11:55.020 --> 01:11:56.896
Upon completion of the mission.

01:11:57.105 --> 01:11:58.815
They must take the poison.

01:11:59.899 --> 01:12:01.735
No wonder he was sad.

01:12:01.901 --> 01:12:03.945
He had to kill them all.

01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:06.281
But there are only 15 here

01:12:06.448 --> 01:12:08.033
2 up there, that's only 17!

01:12:08.158 --> 01:12:08.825
One is missing.

01:12:08.992 --> 01:12:09.951
What happened to him?

01:12:17.334 --> 01:12:19.419
There was a clever guard.

01:12:19.544 --> 01:12:21.546
He didn't take the pill.

01:12:21.713 --> 01:12:22.088
Are you alright?

01:12:22.213 --> 01:12:23.089
Who is he?

01:12:23.256 --> 01:12:25.425
If I'm right, your name is Adolf.

01:12:26.634 --> 01:12:27.844
How did you know?

01:12:28.011 --> 01:12:29.429
Your name is on the knife.

01:12:29.596 --> 01:12:32.515
You're the clever guard.

01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:37.562
You murdered grandpa!

01:12:37.771 --> 01:12:39.647
He was evil.

01:12:39.773 --> 01:12:41.608
He tricked us

01:12:42.359 --> 01:12:46.112
I refused and he broke my legs

01:12:46.738 --> 01:12:50.867
I've waited so long for today.

01:12:50.992 --> 01:12:53.161
The gold belongs to the United Nations.

01:12:53.286 --> 01:12:56.956
As long as it's here.

01:12:57.374 --> 01:12:59.834
It's mine.

01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:01.378
Let us find it first.

01:13:02.212 --> 01:13:03.254
Which way to go?

01:13:03.421 --> 01:13:05.090
I remember we went this way.

01:13:06.216 --> 01:13:07.425
You go first.

01:13:08.968 --> 01:13:10.970
Don't pull any tricks!

01:13:11.137 --> 01:13:12.222
Who are the others?

01:13:12.764 --> 01:13:13.807
Mercenaries.

01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:15.642
They work for me.

01:13:15.934 --> 01:13:17.727
They only work for money.

01:13:17.852 --> 01:13:18.603
Get going!

01:13:19.145 --> 01:13:20.522
Why don't we pay them more.

01:13:20.688 --> 01:13:21.981
And make them work for us?

01:13:22.148 --> 01:13:24.526
And they'll take your share too.

01:13:25.276 --> 01:13:27.445
Don't make trouble! Move!

01:13:28.863 --> 01:13:30.073
Move!

01:13:38.498 --> 01:13:39.582
Let's go!

01:13:41.543 --> 01:13:42.836
This way...

01:13:49.175 --> 01:13:50.260
This way, hurry!

01:13:50.385 --> 01:13:51.136
Climb down.

01:13:51.261 --> 01:13:52.345
Down!

01:13:55.265 --> 01:13:56.141
Mark.

01:13:56.307 --> 01:13:57.016
What?

01:13:57.517 --> 01:13:59.394
Start the generator over there

01:13:59.727 --> 01:14:00.603
Ben, you go.

01:14:00.728 --> 01:14:01.855
Everyone else keep going.

01:14:02.188 --> 01:14:03.356
Don't open fire.

01:14:07.360 --> 01:14:08.235
There are munitions down there.

01:14:08.236 --> 01:14:09.988
- Don't shoot.
- Yes, Sir.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:21.791
There they are.

01:14:21.875 --> 01:14:22.750
Someone is coming!

01:14:27.297 --> 01:14:28.423
Hide over there!

01:14:29.132 --> 01:14:29.674
Hurry!

01:14:31.634 --> 01:14:32.218
They've gone inside.

01:14:32.343 --> 01:14:33.219
Follow them.

01:14:35.555 --> 01:14:36.556
Split up.

01:14:46.399 --> 01:14:47.317
Be careful!

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:51.696
Don't shoot!

01:14:51.779 --> 01:14:53.531
It's no use. It's bullet proof!

01:14:59.829 --> 01:15:00.455
Try again.

01:15:06.711 --> 01:15:08.922
The lights better not come on!

01:15:17.430 --> 01:15:18.389
Ready.

01:15:22.936 --> 01:15:23.770
They found us

01:15:23.895 --> 01:15:24.437
Jackie, where are you?

01:15:24.521 --> 01:15:25.438
One is missing.

01:15:25.897 --> 01:15:27.023
Damn!

01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:30.527
No lights, please!

01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:49.462
He can't escape with the lights on.

01:15:51.839 --> 01:15:52.840
Almost!

01:15:53.007 --> 01:15:54.092
Hurry!

01:15:54.259 --> 01:15:54.968
Almost...

01:15:58.471 --> 01:15:59.138
Don't move.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:01.808
Or I'll shoot.

01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:04.310
Hands on your head! Stand aside!

01:16:04.727 --> 01:16:05.687
Great!

01:16:06.104 --> 01:16:07.063
Don't move!

01:16:07.188 --> 01:16:07.939
You're incredible.

01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:09.065
Ada, get rid of the guns.

01:16:09.148 --> 01:16:10.316
OK

01:16:12.193 --> 01:16:13.653
Be careful.

01:16:13.861 --> 01:16:14.862
Where should I put them?

01:16:17.574 --> 01:16:18.408
I'll tie them up.

01:16:18.533 --> 01:16:19.293
Shoot if they move.

01:16:19.325 --> 01:16:20.285
OK

01:16:20.952 --> 01:16:22.412
Don't move or I'll shoot.

01:16:22.537 --> 01:16:24.747
She means it.

01:16:24.872 --> 01:16:25.790
Don't move!

01:16:32.171 --> 01:16:32.880
You be careful!

01:16:33.006 --> 01:16:34.173
You're so clumsy!

01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:35.508
Don't move!

01:16:38.553 --> 01:16:40.053
Jackie.

01:16:40.054 --> 01:16:41.222
Nothing I can do!

01:16:42.098 --> 01:16:42.682
Charge!

01:16:44.434 --> 01:16:45.893
Look after yourself!

01:17:20.219 --> 01:17:22.013
Jackie!

01:17:23.598 --> 01:17:24.682
I'm busy!

01:17:39.614 --> 01:17:40.406
Pull him down!

01:17:40.531 --> 01:17:42.241
Pull him down!

01:17:42.575 --> 01:17:43.368
Knock him down!

01:17:43.576 --> 01:17:45.828
Harder!

01:18:03.137 --> 01:18:04.263
Take the stairs!

01:18:13.773 --> 01:18:14.774
What should we do?

01:18:17.652 --> 01:18:19.362
Let's fight.

01:18:33.793 --> 01:18:34.585
Go!

01:19:03.656 --> 01:19:05.450
Stop him! Don't let him get away!

01:19:08.369 --> 01:19:10.204
Let's fight some more.

01:19:10.455 --> 01:19:11.706
Very well.

01:20:02.340 --> 01:20:03.841
What about him?

01:20:56.018 --> 01:20:57.144
Help me!

01:21:07.864 --> 01:21:09.240
Pull me up!

01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:19.834
Playing tricks?

01:21:38.811 --> 01:21:39.645
In the middle!

01:21:41.147 --> 01:21:41.828
One more for you!

01:21:45.151 --> 01:21:45.818
Is he out?

01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:46.777
Almost.

01:21:46.903 --> 01:21:47.987
We go over there and help.

01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:24.649
Come on.

01:22:37.995 --> 01:22:39.205
We...

01:22:40.039 --> 01:22:42.291
Joe, open up!

01:22:42.541 --> 01:22:43.541
See if my hand is alright.

01:22:43.542 --> 01:22:44.293
It's fine.

01:22:48.255 --> 01:22:49.715
Bitch!

01:23:00.226 --> 01:23:01.560
I haven't even touched you!

01:23:10.528 --> 01:23:14.281
Give me the key!

01:23:14.490 --> 01:23:15.449
Are you alright?

01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.039
Don't forget.

01:23:22.164 --> 01:23:24.417
Only I know how to use the key.

01:23:25.793 --> 01:23:27.420
My mom's birthday is the code.

01:23:27.503 --> 01:23:30.006
Only I know the date.

01:23:31.424 --> 01:23:33.759
Only I know how the unlocking procedure.

01:23:35.177 --> 01:23:36.095
Is it complicated?

01:23:36.220 --> 01:23:38.097
Maybe. Wait till we find the gold.

01:23:38.222 --> 01:23:39.143
How do we go from here?

01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:40.891
There is a passage.

01:23:41.142 --> 01:23:42.101
Over there.

01:23:42.435 --> 01:23:43.894
You go first.

01:23:54.655 --> 01:23:57.116
What's the code?

01:23:57.241 --> 01:23:59.452
There are 3 sections, each has its code.

01:23:59.577 --> 01:24:01.579
My mom's birthday is September 16

01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:03.622
Got it!

01:24:04.874 --> 01:24:08.169
I've waited 40 years for this!

01:24:25.895 --> 01:24:27.813
You tricked us!

01:24:27.897 --> 01:24:28.939
I'm not lying

01:24:29.023 --> 01:24:31.525
I told you everything I know.

01:24:31.650 --> 01:24:33.611
My morn was born on September 16.

01:24:33.736 --> 01:24:35.571
Did you forget anything?

01:24:35.696 --> 01:24:37.615
Shut up! Go open it!

01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:44.663
Are you sure it's September 16?

01:24:44.789 --> 01:24:46.499
Yes! No mistake!

01:24:46.791 --> 01:24:48.334
Maybe it's lunar calendar.

01:24:48.459 --> 01:24:49.899
Foreigners don't use lunar calendar.

01:24:50.377 --> 01:24:51.796
Grandpa wrote in his diary.

01:24:51.921 --> 01:24:53.797
That he'll use Eliza's birthday.

01:24:53.798 --> 01:24:55.632
Maybe he didn't.

01:24:55.633 --> 01:24:57.176
Maybe he used your birthday.

01:24:57.635 --> 01:24:58.677
Try mine then.

01:24:58.719 --> 01:24:59.637
Try?

01:25:00.179 --> 01:25:01.055
What is it?

01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:02.056
Grandpa's necklace.

01:25:04.975 --> 01:25:05.893
Maybe this is it!

01:25:06.018 --> 01:25:07.019
What's on the back?

01:25:07.186 --> 01:25:08.437
Which is it?

01:25:12.983 --> 01:25:14.443
698?

01:25:20.199 --> 01:25:22.785
The bullets can penetrate 10 people.

01:25:25.412 --> 01:25:27.039
First number is 6

01:25:34.338 --> 01:25:36.340
Shut up! Move your hand!

01:25:44.306 --> 01:25:45.224
I said 8.

01:25:47.393 --> 01:25:49.311
Why doesn't it open?

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:56.277
What is it?

01:25:56.735 --> 01:25:59.613
The handle is built for a reason.

01:26:07.163 --> 01:26:08.539
What now?

01:26:26.807 --> 01:26:29.142
I'm scared! Really scared!

01:26:29.143 --> 01:26:30.436
It'll be alright.

01:26:59.632 --> 01:27:00.758
Go help him!

01:27:05.763 --> 01:27:07.431
This is a very small base!

01:27:08.224 --> 01:27:09.433
I thought the gold is in here.

01:27:09.642 --> 01:27:11.852
This is the elevator, you moron!

01:27:12.519 --> 01:27:13.395
Get in!

01:27:25.616 --> 01:27:26.533
Take a look!

01:27:40.881 --> 01:27:42.925
Pull off the canvas! Hurry!

01:27:43.425 --> 01:27:46.345
Hurry! Pull off the canvas up there!

01:27:59.316 --> 01:28:00.234
Gold!

01:28:01.068 --> 01:28:02.569
A lot of gold!

01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:04.321
2.5 tons is mine.

01:28:04.697 --> 01:28:05.864
We're rich!

01:28:14.081 --> 01:28:16.125
Push me in! Push!

01:28:16.250 --> 01:28:18.002
You think they'll still listen to you?

01:28:19.128 --> 01:28:20.337
Push me in!

01:28:24.842 --> 01:28:26.343
We're rich!

01:28:30.472 --> 01:28:31.432
Don't move!

01:28:32.141 --> 01:28:34.181
Tell them to drop their guns
or I'll blow your head.

01:28:34.184 --> 01:28:37.854
Your heard him! Drop your guns!

01:28:37.855 --> 01:28:38.480
Don't.

01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:42.067
Come help me, you moron!

01:28:42.192 --> 01:28:43.652
Don't ever call me a moron again!

01:28:44.361 --> 01:28:46.488
Think of a way to save me!

01:28:46.655 --> 01:28:47.655
I'm calling the shots now!

01:28:47.656 --> 01:28:48.823
Don't yell at me!

01:28:48.824 --> 01:28:51.118
You traitor!

01:28:51.660 --> 01:28:53.370
For 240 tons of gold

01:28:53.495 --> 01:28:55.205
I'll betray anyone.

01:28:55.331 --> 01:28:57.624
You can kill him if you want.

01:28:58.751 --> 01:29:00.044
Let's play stud poker

01:29:00.127 --> 01:29:02.713
I'll shoot if you don't drop the gun
when I count to 3

01:29:04.465 --> 01:29:05.549
<i>2</i>

01:29:10.846 --> 01:29:11.889
He won.

01:29:12.681 --> 01:29:14.641
We don't care if you kill him.

01:29:14.767 --> 01:29:16.560
There's more gold behind the passage.

01:29:17.770 --> 01:29:19.063
If you spare me

01:29:19.188 --> 01:29:21.565
I'll help you find it.

01:29:22.399 --> 01:29:24.234
You can't pull anything anymore

01:29:24.401 --> 01:29:25.401
Joe, keep an eye on them.

01:29:25.486 --> 01:29:27.905
You come with me!

01:29:28.072 --> 01:29:30.157
- You start moving the gold.
- Yes, Sir.

01:29:35.079 --> 01:29:35.703
Come and help.

01:29:35.704 --> 01:29:36.747
Stop kidding around.

01:29:40.334 --> 01:29:41.626
Help me move the gold.

01:29:41.627 --> 01:29:42.669
Alright.

01:29:55.099 --> 01:29:55.933
What's going on?

01:30:00.854 --> 01:30:01.813
What should we do now?

01:30:01.814 --> 01:30:03.147
There's a control room upstairs.

01:30:03.148 --> 01:30:05.234
Let's go see how Condor's doing.

01:30:05.317 --> 01:30:06.193
Help me up!

01:30:06.944 --> 01:30:08.861
Let's go Ada, forget the gold?

01:30:08.862 --> 01:30:09.613
Corning.

01:30:28.715 --> 01:30:30.092
They're down there!

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:31.802
It's too dark. Turn on the lights.

01:30:31.969 --> 01:30:32.845
Over there!

01:30:35.013 --> 01:30:35.893
The lights don't work.

01:30:46.525 --> 01:30:47.693
That's not the switch.

01:30:57.828 --> 01:30:58.953
All these switches. Which one is it?

01:30:58.954 --> 01:31:00.414
You can't even find a light switch!

01:31:13.135 --> 01:31:14.178
It's on.

01:31:28.150 --> 01:31:29.610
Turn off the fan.

01:31:30.277 --> 01:31:31.194
Which switch?

01:31:31.195 --> 01:31:32.863
Damn! Which one is it?

01:31:33.155 --> 01:31:34.031
Try your luck.

01:32:06.104 --> 01:32:07.064
Damn!

01:32:24.498 --> 01:32:25.790
Ada, could it be those switches?

01:32:25.791 --> 01:32:26.583
What switch?

01:32:27.334 --> 01:32:28.293
It's slowing down.

01:32:34.716 --> 01:32:35.876
Stop him! I'll open the door.

01:32:50.691 --> 01:32:52.317
What's keeping Adolf?

01:32:52.484 --> 01:32:54.361
Can Momoko carry Adolf?

01:32:54.528 --> 01:32:55.988
Oops! Let's go help her.

01:33:24.349 --> 01:33:25.767
Why is it like this?

01:33:25.851 --> 01:33:27.185
It's sucking me.

01:33:27.352 --> 01:33:28.353
Damn!

01:33:33.775 --> 01:33:34.776
Try for yourself.

01:33:34.860 --> 01:33:36.278
Me? Alright.

01:34:01.678 --> 01:34:02.721
Why is it like this?

01:34:03.972 --> 01:34:04.890
What should we do?

01:34:05.766 --> 01:34:07.286
We haven't tried that set of switches.

01:34:08.101 --> 01:34:08.560
Hurry!

01:34:08.561 --> 01:34:09.478
Hit it!

01:34:27.120 --> 01:34:28.330
Don't touch those switches!

01:34:28.455 --> 01:34:29.581
I already did.

01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:30.624
It's stopping.

01:34:30.791 --> 01:34:31.374
Yes!

01:34:31.375 --> 01:34:32.376
Of course!

01:34:32.626 --> 01:34:35.545
That's the self-destruct switch.

01:34:35.671 --> 01:34:38.464
The base will explode in 30 minutes.

01:34:38.465 --> 01:34:39.799
We'll all die.

01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:42.552
Why didn't you wait for me?

01:34:46.223 --> 01:34:47.265
Traitor.

01:34:48.266 --> 01:34:51.895
Now you know the result of betraying me

01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:53.980
Jackie, help us!

01:34:56.858 --> 01:34:57.942
If you get out of the way, kid.

01:34:57.943 --> 01:34:59.069
We'll split the gold.

01:34:59.236 --> 01:35:01.196
No way!

01:35:22.801 --> 01:35:23.802
Go open the door.

01:35:23.969 --> 01:35:24.845
Yes

01:35:31.435 --> 01:35:33.145
I won't let you get away.

01:35:36.148 --> 01:35:37.274
Hurry and open the door.

01:35:44.781 --> 01:35:47.325
Don't stand there! Move!

01:35:48.034 --> 01:35:48.952
You hear me?

01:37:07.405 --> 01:37:09.533
Superman.

01:37:21.670 --> 01:37:23.421
Superman.

01:37:34.266 --> 01:37:35.892
This is fun.

01:37:54.160 --> 01:37:56.580
Super athlete's foot.

01:38:17.934 --> 01:38:19.686
Stop dancing around, it'll explode.

01:38:24.232 --> 01:38:25.817
Use the loudspeaker.

01:38:26.985 --> 01:38:29.487
Come up! The base will explode.

01:38:30.614 --> 01:38:31.406
Explode?

01:38:34.367 --> 01:38:35.951
In less than 20 minutes!

01:38:35.952 --> 01:38:37.704
I wanted to help.

01:38:37.871 --> 01:38:39.247
- Elsa told me to press the button.
- What should we do now?

01:38:39.372 --> 01:38:41.041
There's no way out.

01:38:43.209 --> 01:38:45.628
Unless we blast through the vent.

01:38:45.629 --> 01:38:47.672
What? Blast our way out?

01:38:47.756 --> 01:38:51.301
Yes. That's the weakest point.

01:38:53.094 --> 01:38:54.179
Harness the wind power.

01:38:57.432 --> 01:38:58.183
Corning down.

01:38:58.308 --> 01:38:59.267
Momoko, give me a hand.

01:39:03.063 --> 01:39:04.064
Here's the switch

01:39:04.189 --> 01:39:05.649
Adolf won't leave

01:39:06.149 --> 01:39:07.359
I will not leave

01:39:07.484 --> 01:39:09.361
I should have died here 40 years ago

01:39:09.486 --> 01:39:11.196
I want to be with my friends

01:39:11.363 --> 01:39:14.366
I must stay, goodbye!

01:39:14.574 --> 01:39:16.534
Very well! Let's go!

01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:18.912
Fix the rope! I'll close the door.

01:39:21.998 --> 01:39:23.038
We're running out of time!

01:39:23.416 --> 01:39:26.294
I'll turn up the fan and send you out.

01:39:26.461 --> 01:39:27.754
Good luck.

01:39:32.717 --> 01:39:34.135
Ready? Hurry!

01:39:36.554 --> 01:39:37.429
Leave those!

01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:38.598
Of course not!

01:39:47.524 --> 01:39:48.817
Elsa, must I take them?

01:39:48.942 --> 01:39:50.568
Consider doing it for me.

01:39:57.075 --> 01:39:57.867
Gold!

01:39:57.993 --> 01:39:59.160
Leave those!

01:40:44.330 --> 01:40:46.708
Forget it!

01:42:01.241 --> 01:42:02.158
Are you alright?

01:42:02.325 --> 01:42:03.326
Go find them.

01:42:07.997 --> 01:42:10.834
Get out! It'll collapse!

01:42:28.434 --> 01:42:29.394
Completely caved in!

01:42:29.602 --> 01:42:30.269
Let's go.

01:42:30.270 --> 01:42:32.355
At least you're still alive!

01:42:49.789 --> 01:42:51.499
Here's a consolation prize

01:42:57.338 --> 01:43:00.842
Allah brought you to us.

01:43:03.553 --> 01:43:07.182
Here's some gold for you.

01:43:11.561 --> 01:43:13.520
We don't want gold, we want water.

01:43:13.521 --> 01:43:14.522
Water!

01:43:16.816 --> 01:43:19.360
Finish it if there's any left.

01:43:21.738 --> 01:43:22.738
People don't know.

01:43:22.739 --> 01:43:24.532
What they really want.

01:43:27.327 --> 01:43:27.951
If we had water.

01:43:27.952 --> 01:43:30.079
We would not have such a tough time.

01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:34.042
Water! Give me water!

01:43:34.167 --> 01:43:36.461
Let's go find water.

01:43:37.378 --> 01:43:39.505
Where?

01:43:39.839 --> 01:43:40.505
If I'm not mistaken.

01:43:40.506 --> 01:43:42.926
Up that hill. Let's go!

01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:44.552
Really?

01:43:45.261 --> 01:43:47.304
Is this way closer?

01:43:47.305 --> 01:43:50.266
Listen to the expert.

01:43:51.267 --> 01:43:53.894
We've been up and down the hill!

01:43:53.895 --> 01:43:55.354
Just a bit further.

01:43:55.355 --> 01:43:56.606
Really?

01:43:56.940 --> 01:43:59.150
You should listen to the expert.

01:43:59.317 --> 01:44:01.861
Over the hill, there's enough to swim in.

01:44:01.945 --> 01:44:05.197
Only 25% of Sahara is covered with sand.

01:44:05.198 --> 01:44:07.283
Let's go, it won't be far
