WEBVTT

00:03.503 --> 00:05.171
Tell me about it.

00:05.255 --> 00:07.007
Oh, for sure.
For sure.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.800
Perf. It's a date.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.012
Bad news, guys.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.096
Here we go.

00:13.179 --> 00:14.514
I'm serious, Hayley!

00:14.597 --> 00:16.307
I'm all torn up over here!

00:16.391 --> 00:18.351
I have bad news...

00:18.435 --> 00:20.270
for my haters!

00:20.353 --> 00:24.232
Because Danuta is giving
your boy Klaus another shot!

00:24.315 --> 00:26.609
Isn't Danuta dating someone
better than you?

00:26.693 --> 00:30.196
She was!
But he was hit by a train.

00:30.280 --> 00:31.281
Hayley?

00:31.364 --> 00:32.949
Fine.

00:33.033 --> 00:35.744
Danuta has entered the small,
glorious window

00:35.827 --> 00:38.830
I like to call
"The Rebound Zone."

00:38.913 --> 00:40.498
But your personality,
Klaus.

00:40.582 --> 00:41.791
It's so bad.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.543
Way ahead
of you, Hayley.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.588
In the Rebound Zone,
cash is king.

00:46.671 --> 00:48.298
The first suitor
to impress Danuta

00:48.381 --> 00:51.509
with a grand display of wealth
will win her heart.

00:51.593 --> 00:52.761
Attention, everyone.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.387
It's Crunk Night
at the club,

00:54.471 --> 00:55.638
and I don't want
to look stupid.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.098
Now, which one of
these chains

00:57.182 --> 00:58.558
screams "Atlanta?"

00:58.641 --> 01:01.436
"A" for Atlanta,
or 7 for Michael Vick?

01:01.519 --> 01:02.812
The club?

01:02.896 --> 01:05.398
Stan, this is the third time
this week.

01:07.025 --> 01:09.360
This is how men blow off
steam, Francine.

01:09.444 --> 01:11.946
They go to the club,
order bottle service, and dance.

01:12.030 --> 01:13.490
I shouldn't have
to explain this.

01:13.573 --> 01:14.574
It's caveman shit.

01:14.657 --> 01:16.826
Women like to dance, too!

01:16.910 --> 01:17.911
Do they, though?

01:17.994 --> 01:19.037
Yes!

01:19.120 --> 01:21.414
I've asked you to take me
dancing for years!

01:21.498 --> 01:23.291
I want to spend
time with you!

01:23.374 --> 01:26.419
Oh, my God. We literally
just went to Target.

01:26.503 --> 01:27.962
We bought me
these socks.

01:28.046 --> 01:30.090
I rode in the car with you
the whole way back.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.968
There's a difference
between buying socks

01:34.052 --> 01:36.221
and being connected.

01:36.304 --> 01:37.430
Is there, though?

01:40.016 --> 01:42.602

What the hell

02:15.635 --> 02:17.387
My name is Henderson.

02:17.470 --> 02:18.888
Okay.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.390
Uh, y-you don't know me,

02:20.473 --> 02:22.392
but I was an acquaintance
of Jack Smith.

02:22.475 --> 02:23.810
Your husband's father.

02:23.893 --> 02:25.854
Jack's dead. Bye.

02:28.690 --> 02:31.401
I know about
Jack's death.

02:31.484 --> 02:35.238
I would have come sooner,
but I live in Arizona now.

02:35.321 --> 02:36.656
Cool?

02:36.739 --> 02:39.284
I also knew Jack's
little boy, Stan.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.703
I'm sorry.
Shithead, is it?

02:41.786 --> 02:43.079
Henderson.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.706
Jack is dead,

02:44.789 --> 02:47.917
and Stan is all grown up
with an angry wife.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.879
You'll have to pay your
respects some other time.

02:52.297 --> 02:53.923
I think we have
a misunderstanding.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.216
I'm not here
to pay respects.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.177
I'm here
to collect a debt.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.220
Sit on that sofa
and don't move!

02:59.304 --> 03:02.140
It's story time.

03:02.223 --> 03:04.934
Year was 1988.

03:05.018 --> 03:07.228
Now, without computers
and smartphones,

03:07.312 --> 03:09.856
bad fathers watched porn
in the living room.

03:11.482 --> 03:13.610
I learned so much
in school today!

03:13.693 --> 03:16.237
Get this --
the sun is a star!

03:16.321 --> 03:17.780
Enough with the questions.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.366
Can't you bore that pen pal
I set you up with?

03:20.450 --> 03:22.410
They hanged him
on Christmas.

03:22.493 --> 03:24.704
Nobody hated being a dad

03:24.787 --> 03:26.956
more than Jack Smith.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.172
Are you here
to tuck me in?

03:34.255 --> 03:36.549
Get an imaginary friend
to tuck you in.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.720
It's quaalude time,
people!

03:40.803 --> 03:42.096
Stan felt like

03:42.180 --> 03:45.308
the loneliest boy
in the whole world.

03:45.391 --> 03:48.811
God, will you send me
an imaginary friend?

03:50.104 --> 03:53.358
And that's when
I fell into Stan's life.

03:53.441 --> 03:56.611
Dad, I did it!
I made an imaginary friend!

03:56.694 --> 03:58.112
He fell from Heaven!

03:58.196 --> 03:59.197
And Jack realized

03:59.280 --> 04:01.658
his prayers
had been answered, too.

04:01.741 --> 04:05.203
He never had to spend time
with his son again.

04:05.286 --> 04:10.291
From that day on, he paid me
to be Stan's imaginary friend.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.961
Arrgh! Methinks
Captain Blackbeard's

04:13.044 --> 04:15.129
treasure be
'round here somewhere!

04:15.213 --> 04:17.966
Yarr!
I'll watch some TV,

04:18.049 --> 04:21.678
in case they hide
treasure clues in the shows.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.889
On which channel
be Donahue?

04:24.973 --> 04:27.100
41. 42.

04:27.183 --> 04:29.310
What do you mean
you skipped town?

04:29.394 --> 04:31.020
What about my money, Jack?

04:31.104 --> 04:32.438
Ready or not,

04:32.522 --> 04:34.732
-here I come.
-I ain't hidden yet!

04:34.816 --> 04:36.317
Count to 3,000!

04:36.401 --> 04:38.569
Okay!

04:38.653 --> 04:40.780
51. 52.

04:40.863 --> 04:42.115
53...

04:42.198 --> 04:45.535
Jack took off
and stiffed me 300 bucks,

04:45.618 --> 04:47.245
so I ditched Stan, too.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.831
Took a methamphetamine gig
in Arizona.

04:49.914 --> 04:51.749
Oh, my God!

04:51.833 --> 04:54.043
You and Jack are monsters!

04:54.127 --> 04:55.503
If Stan ever found out --

04:55.586 --> 04:57.297
He'd be crushed.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.881
Which is why you're
gonna cough up

04:58.965 --> 05:01.467
the 300 clams
Jack owed me.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.261
You're despicable.

05:03.344 --> 05:07.807
I can't believe you manipulated
a kid like that.

05:07.890 --> 05:10.393
Whoa, $500! Thanks.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.437
Don't thank me, scumbag.

05:12.520 --> 05:13.938
I'm hiring you.

05:14.022 --> 05:16.983
You are gonna convince Stan
to take me dancing.

05:17.066 --> 05:19.277
Don't mind me. Just passing
through. Huge plans.

05:19.360 --> 05:22.363
Whoa, dude.
You are haggard.

05:22.447 --> 05:24.240
So haggard.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.660
So-o-o-o haggard.

05:27.744 --> 05:29.287
I'm off.

05:34.083 --> 05:36.294
These fishbowls are
so cheap-looking.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.796
How am I supposed
to impress Danuta?

05:38.880 --> 05:40.590
-I already told you --
-That one.

05:40.673 --> 05:42.550
Look at the glasswork.

05:42.633 --> 05:45.094
Please tell me it costs
less than the $30

05:45.178 --> 05:47.180
I have in my flex
spending account.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.973
Not even close.

05:49.057 --> 05:51.434
I'm gonna call
Danuta and cancel our date.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.102
Forget about her.

05:53.186 --> 05:56.564
In fact, let's forget
about everything.

05:56.647 --> 05:58.441
Sick bong, Jeff.

05:58.524 --> 06:00.610
Thanks.
I made it myself.

06:00.693 --> 06:02.528
I've been dabbling
in glassblowing.

06:02.612 --> 06:05.281
Jeff, do you realize
what this means?

06:05.365 --> 06:06.866
-You could blow me...
-Ha!

06:06.949 --> 06:09.285
...a fishbowl
for my date.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.495

stud?

06:19.003 --> 06:20.922
I'm just here to dance
with my friends.

06:21.005 --> 06:23.925
Then why are you dressed
like a slut?

06:24.926 --> 06:28.304
Whatever.
You're fat, anyways.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.099
Don't listen to her.
You've had two kids!

06:31.182 --> 06:32.725
You look amazing!

06:32.809 --> 06:34.060
I should
get out of here.

06:34.143 --> 06:36.562
Francine's taken the fun
out of dancing.

06:36.646 --> 06:40.066
Wait, this is my song!

Smith!

06:53.621 --> 06:55.581
Francine and I, ugh.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.501
Smith, I have some advice.

06:58.584 --> 07:02.004
My True Religions are
absolutely drenched in piss.

07:02.088 --> 07:03.673
See you at work!

07:06.801 --> 07:07.802
Hey, Blackbeard.

07:09.470 --> 07:10.930
Henderson?

07:11.013 --> 07:12.557
It can't be.

07:12.640 --> 07:15.143
My long-lost
imaginary friend!

07:15.226 --> 07:17.019
You came back to me!

07:17.103 --> 07:19.272
Are you ladies done
with the wall?

07:19.355 --> 07:20.815
I need
to take a dump.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.030
I never forgot about you,
Henderson.

07:28.114 --> 07:30.241
I missed you so much!

07:30.324 --> 07:33.578
But why would an imaginary
friend get so old

07:33.661 --> 07:35.037
and sad-looking?

07:35.121 --> 07:38.040
'Cause of all the
imaginary drugs I've done.

07:38.124 --> 07:39.125
Ah.

07:39.208 --> 07:42.587
Stan, you're finally
using the tree house,

07:42.670 --> 07:46.132
all alone,
but I brought you two beers,

07:46.215 --> 07:48.426
because beers are good.

07:48.509 --> 07:50.303
Oh, God.
She's so annoying.

07:50.386 --> 07:51.387
I'll get rid of her.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.931
Wow, look at the time.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.309
Better stop jerking off alone
in my tree house

07:56.392 --> 07:57.810
while there's
still daylight.

07:57.894 --> 08:00.271
-Nice.
-Okay.

08:00.354 --> 08:04.233
Guess I should
boogie-oogie-oogie back inside,

08:04.317 --> 08:07.945
'cause I love dancing.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.364
"You're finally
using the tree house."

08:10.448 --> 08:11.699
Come on, dude.

08:11.782 --> 08:12.992
Don't come in here
with that when

08:13.075 --> 08:14.577
you're obviously
checking up on me.

08:14.660 --> 08:16.996
Mm!
Whadda-hella-dis?

08:17.079 --> 08:19.999
There's only one candy corn
for every two pretzels!

08:20.082 --> 08:21.334
Forget this.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.544
You don't deserve
a woman like her.

08:23.628 --> 08:25.254
So long, Stan.

08:25.338 --> 08:27.840
Wait.
If you're saying that,

08:27.924 --> 08:30.551
it means I think
I don't deserve her.

08:30.635 --> 08:31.636
How do I keep her?

08:31.719 --> 08:33.679
Take your wife dancing!

08:33.763 --> 08:35.765
Dancing?
With my wife?

08:35.848 --> 08:37.892
Oh, there's got to be
a Plan B. Aah!

08:37.975 --> 08:39.852
When you were 8 years old,
you had nothing.

08:39.936 --> 08:41.687
Look at your life
now, dummy.

08:41.771 --> 08:43.773
You got a beautiful wife,
okay kids,

08:43.856 --> 08:46.192
and you're gonna
give it all up for what?

08:46.275 --> 08:49.612
To jerk it in a tree house
all alone until you die?

08:49.695 --> 08:52.448
I mean, doesn't
sound that bad.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.159
For an imaginary friend,
you sure pack a wallop.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.244
It's true.

08:56.327 --> 08:59.747
Henderson did pack a wallop,
but it worked.

08:59.830 --> 09:01.082
Stan took me dancing.

09:01.165 --> 09:03.167
Francine, what are you
doing in the voiceover booth?

09:03.251 --> 09:04.919
I've got this booked to record
a commercial

09:05.002 --> 09:06.671
for Brockton Jock Straps --

09:06.754 --> 09:09.298
"The only jock strap
with extra fabric to cover

09:09.382 --> 09:11.759
your whole, horrible ass."

09:13.344 --> 09:15.972
Okay, I locked in a rezzie
at Ruby Tuesday's.

09:16.055 --> 09:18.391
You gotta make me
the perfect fishbowl.

09:18.474 --> 09:20.685
We're talking
three dragons minimum.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.103
I got this, Klaus.

09:22.186 --> 09:23.271
Stand back.

09:23.354 --> 09:26.232
It's about to get toasty.

10:02.977 --> 10:06.022
I'm not trying to bang
George R.R. Martin over here!

10:06.105 --> 10:08.733
I need this to be
a panty-melter, bro-ham.

10:08.816 --> 10:10.484
Do it again!

10:11.819 --> 10:14.030
Tonight was magical,
my love.

10:14.113 --> 10:16.449
I feel like Cinderella.

10:16.532 --> 10:18.534
You look like
Cinderella, too.

10:18.618 --> 10:19.994
Like in your face.

10:21.621 --> 10:23.831
I worked up a sweat,
and I need to run my balls

10:23.914 --> 10:26.083
under the sink,
then let's make sweet love.

10:26.167 --> 10:28.127
Clean balls!

10:28.210 --> 10:31.255
Now I know
I'm in a fairytale.

10:35.676 --> 10:37.511
How was dancing?

10:37.595 --> 10:39.055
Henderson!

10:39.138 --> 10:40.931
What are you doing
in my bathroom?

10:41.015 --> 10:42.433
Eating an apple.

10:42.516 --> 10:45.436
I mean why are you doing
in my bathroom?

10:45.519 --> 10:47.271
Waiting for
my next assignment.

10:47.355 --> 10:48.439
And payment.

10:48.522 --> 10:50.608
There is no
next assignment!

10:50.691 --> 10:52.777
Our business arrangement
is over.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.279
Marriage rekindled!
Mission accomplished!

10:55.363 --> 10:59.158
Then I guess I should tell Stan
everything and crush him.

10:59.241 --> 11:01.369
It'll probably end
your marriage.

11:04.163 --> 11:05.915
Francine?

11:05.998 --> 11:08.250
I think you're gonna like this!

11:08.334 --> 11:10.753
-Guess what I am?
-I need to come clean.

11:10.836 --> 11:11.962
Guess, Francine.

11:12.046 --> 11:13.339
Sex gargoyle?

11:13.422 --> 11:16.550
Nope. Horse statue
outside PF Chang's,

11:16.634 --> 11:19.470
A.K.A. your favorite
statue in the world.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.430
You remembered!

11:21.514 --> 11:24.100
Oh, you're making
this so hard.

11:24.183 --> 11:26.686
Stan, there is something
you need to know.

11:26.769 --> 11:28.979
Hold that thought while
I come clean about something.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.774
It wasn't my idea
to take you dancing.

11:33.234 --> 11:36.904
I have an imaginary friend
named Henderson.

11:36.987 --> 11:40.157
He made me realize
that you are my everything,

11:40.241 --> 11:42.535
and I never want
to drift apart.

11:42.618 --> 11:44.120
You were about to
confess something?

11:44.203 --> 11:45.705
Oh, wow.

11:45.788 --> 11:48.082
Stan, I...

11:48.165 --> 11:50.668
once bought a bunch
of 9th graders beer

11:50.751 --> 11:52.628
at a Blues Traveler
concert.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.339
Sounds like you're only
confessing to one thing --

11:55.423 --> 11:57.258
being a super cool lady.

11:57.341 --> 12:00.428
Well, take some advice
from a super cool lady.

12:00.511 --> 12:04.306
Stan, get rid of
your imaginary friend.

12:04.390 --> 12:06.142
He's not real!

12:06.225 --> 12:07.560
But I am.

12:07.643 --> 12:09.478
Who's Henderson?

12:09.562 --> 12:10.980
I know you didn't say
"Henderson,"

12:11.063 --> 12:13.232
so that didn't totally work,
but you get the idea.

12:13.315 --> 12:15.901
So just to clarify,
you're getting rid of Henderson?

12:15.985 --> 12:17.194
Who's Henderson?

12:20.781 --> 12:22.366
There's paper on me!

12:22.450 --> 12:23.743
Get it off!
Get it off!

12:23.826 --> 12:26.412
Don't move, Mom!
It's stuck to your face!

12:26.495 --> 12:27.747
It's paper!

12:31.250 --> 12:34.128
Well, here's the problem.
It's paper.

12:34.211 --> 12:36.797
Oh. It's a love note
from Stan.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.258
"I took Henderson skydiving.

12:39.341 --> 12:43.345
He came from the heavens,
and thither he shall return.

12:43.429 --> 12:46.015
Text if you need tampons,
my queen."

12:46.098 --> 12:47.141
-Aww.
-Aww.

12:47.224 --> 12:48.225
Oh, no!

12:51.979 --> 12:53.105
Uh.

12:53.189 --> 12:54.315
What's happening?

12:54.398 --> 12:56.942
When do I get
my parachute?

12:57.026 --> 13:00.446
You were the greatest friend
a boy could ask for,

13:00.529 --> 13:04.283
but when a boy marries a girl,
he doesn't need friends.

13:04.366 --> 13:05.493
I realize that now.

13:05.576 --> 13:07.912
I-I'm scared, Stan.

13:07.995 --> 13:09.997
I want to go back down
to the ground!

13:10.080 --> 13:12.124
You can go
wherever you want.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.918
You're imaginary.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.503
What the hell
are you doing?

13:15.586 --> 13:17.129
It's time for you
to help some

13:17.213 --> 13:19.465
other boy the way
you helped me.

13:19.548 --> 13:21.383
I wasn't helping!

13:21.467 --> 13:24.261
Your dad hired me
because he didn't love you!

13:24.345 --> 13:26.555
My imagination
is so powerful!

13:26.639 --> 13:27.932
This must be
what Jim Henson

13:28.015 --> 13:30.100
felt like wrestling
with his ideas.

13:30.184 --> 13:31.852
I'm a real man!

13:31.936 --> 13:33.354
My name is Hank Henderson,

13:33.437 --> 13:35.940
and I live in
Flagstaff, Arizona.

13:36.023 --> 13:38.067
You showed me your cards,
Henderson.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.277
Even I know that's not
a real place.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.362
Goodbye, Henderson,

13:41.445 --> 13:44.657
and thank you!

13:46.450 --> 13:48.452
Come on, Stan.

13:48.536 --> 13:50.412
Don't do anything stupid.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.001
Francine?

13:56.085 --> 13:57.545
No freaking way.

13:57.628 --> 13:58.963
You're never gonna
believe this.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.090
Henderson landed
on your car!

14:01.173 --> 14:05.177
Huh. I figured he would
disappear or something.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.720
Realistic as hell.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.681
My brain is a marvel.

14:08.764 --> 14:09.849
Good thing
you can't see this.

14:09.932 --> 14:11.350
You'd be, like,
freaking out.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.771
There's that super cool
lady I know and love.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.648
Want to go dancing?

14:22.778 --> 14:24.530
I have the strangest
feeling,

14:24.613 --> 14:26.657
but I can't put
my finger on it.

14:28.450 --> 14:31.829
Stan, I need you
to listen to me

14:31.912 --> 14:33.038
without interrupting.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.456
I live to serve you.

14:34.540 --> 14:36.667
Henderson was hired
by your dad

14:36.750 --> 14:39.545
to be your
imaginary friend.

14:39.628 --> 14:43.883
That guy on the hood
is an actual dead man.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.175
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.802
Oh, my God.

14:46.969 --> 14:48.387
Oh, my God!

14:48.470 --> 14:50.848
My own father?
What a great guy!

14:50.931 --> 14:51.932
What?!

14:52.016 --> 14:54.977
He hired a man to be
my imaginary friend

14:55.060 --> 14:56.729
because he couldn't
be there.

14:56.812 --> 14:58.230
No!

14:58.314 --> 15:01.609
He lied to you,
and I lied to you.

15:01.692 --> 15:05.863
I paid Henderson to manipulate
you into taking me dancing.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.531
I murdered a man.

15:07.615 --> 15:11.410
No. All you did was save
our marriage.

15:11.493 --> 15:12.494
Mind pumping the brakes?

15:15.289 --> 15:17.082
Just drive around that guy.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.964
The reservation
is in 20 minutes!

15:24.048 --> 15:25.716
What the hell
is taking so long?!

15:25.799 --> 15:27.468
All of your
design notes!

15:27.551 --> 15:29.303
I wouldn't have notes
if you did it right

15:29.386 --> 15:30.763
the first time!

15:30.846 --> 15:33.432
How hard is it to make
a fishbowl with one mongoose,

15:33.515 --> 15:34.516
two Pickle Ricks,

15:34.600 --> 15:36.977
and Kawhi Leonard
in a Knicks jersey?

15:40.064 --> 15:41.398
Let's go!

15:41.482 --> 15:43.817
That glass is over
1,000 degrees.

15:43.901 --> 15:45.736
-It needs to cool.
-There's no time.

15:45.819 --> 15:47.571
We'll crank the van's A/C.

15:47.655 --> 15:49.281
To Ruby Tuesday's!

15:51.533 --> 15:53.452
Danuta. Sorry I'm late.
Better late than never.

15:54.870 --> 15:57.706
Klaus, wow.
You look great.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.249
Is that a new
fish bowl?

16:00.668 --> 16:01.669
I hope we're in
the smoking section.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.421
Waiter!
Ice water immediately!

16:04.505 --> 16:06.215
-And for you?
-Hmm.

16:06.298 --> 16:08.759
I'll take...hmm.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.346
Let's make that order
two ice waters.

16:12.429 --> 16:13.722
I'll take
a Chardonnay.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.684
- You heard the lady.
- Hurry!

16:16.767 --> 16:18.394
Ooh, wait.
On second thought,

16:18.477 --> 16:20.020
I'm coming off
a bad relationship,

16:20.104 --> 16:23.357
and I feel like
a dirty martini.

16:29.947 --> 16:33.117
Danuta! Come with me to
the center of the Earth!

16:39.748 --> 16:42.001
Buddy, you're back!
You overheated!

16:42.084 --> 16:43.752
W-What happened
to Danuta?

16:43.836 --> 16:45.671
She got a bacon bleu
cheese burger,

16:45.754 --> 16:48.257
but it was so big,
she dislocated her jaw

16:48.340 --> 16:51.051
trying to take a bite,
and now she's at the hospital

16:51.135 --> 16:53.303
and might be dead.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.597
Where's that burger?
Did she finish it?

16:58.183 --> 17:00.060
Can't believe
it's already Monday.

17:00.144 --> 17:01.687
What did we even
do this weekend?

17:01.770 --> 17:03.105
We killed Henderson.

17:03.188 --> 17:04.523
Oh, yeah.
That was crazy.

17:04.606 --> 17:06.191
How are you
okay with this?

17:06.275 --> 17:08.694
A man is dead
because of us.

17:08.777 --> 17:10.195
If you're worried
about getting caught,

17:10.279 --> 17:12.239
Dick already wiped Henderson
off the grid.

17:12.322 --> 17:14.033
As far as the government
is concerned,

17:14.116 --> 17:16.660
he really was imaginary.

17:18.287 --> 17:20.039
Whoa.
Forgot how to wink.

17:20.122 --> 17:22.750
I'll never be the same.

17:24.918 --> 17:26.545
Come to work
with me, honey.

17:26.628 --> 17:29.715
Our grief counselor works
with PTSD every day.

17:33.969 --> 17:36.055
Go away!

17:36.138 --> 17:37.473
Who are you?

17:37.556 --> 17:40.642
I'm Coach Cathy,
the CIA grief counselor

17:40.726 --> 17:42.853
and coach of
our softball team.

17:42.936 --> 17:44.021
Stan sent me.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.939
You can't help me.

17:46.023 --> 17:49.193
Oh-ho, you sound like
Tina Turbaco.

17:49.276 --> 17:52.029
She was depressed she couldn't
hit an inside curve ball.

17:52.112 --> 17:53.614
Uh, who? What?

17:53.697 --> 17:56.617
Okay, let's see what
we're working with here.

17:56.700 --> 17:58.952
Ooh, still in your robe
at 4:00 P.M.?

17:59.036 --> 18:02.623
Drinking --
Popov from a coffee cup.

18:02.706 --> 18:04.792
Ooh, and an ass that
could stop a Mack truck.

18:04.875 --> 18:06.043
Thank you?

18:06.126 --> 18:07.127
How you holding up?

18:07.211 --> 18:09.630
Bad! I killed a man.

18:09.713 --> 18:11.465
Well, at least
it was a man.

18:11.548 --> 18:14.176
Let's be real,
all guys are assholes.

18:14.259 --> 18:16.970
Most guys, I guess.

18:17.054 --> 18:20.140
There's a little sunshine
peeking through.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.476
Ha! Get on up out
of that sofa!

18:22.559 --> 18:25.562
The van is running!
On the hop!

18:28.148 --> 18:32.611
This -- this is where
all your power comes from.

18:32.694 --> 18:34.154
You play some ball
in high school?

18:34.238 --> 18:36.365
I went to
an all-girls school.

18:36.448 --> 18:39.993
The dream.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.411
What are we doing here?

18:41.495 --> 18:43.497
Don't question my process.

18:43.580 --> 18:46.250
I need you to pick a number
between 1 and 10.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.085
I don't know, 7?

18:48.168 --> 18:49.628
Mickey Mantle.

18:49.711 --> 18:52.131
Don't get upset
if you don't make contact.

18:52.214 --> 18:55.217
Got this pup dialed up
to about a 90.

19:00.556 --> 19:05.144
♪♪

19:06.520 --> 19:12.693
♪♪

19:12.776 --> 19:15.195
You did it!
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

19:15.279 --> 19:17.573
Come to Mama!

19:21.535 --> 19:24.580
How did it feel
when you ripped the tits

19:24.663 --> 19:25.914
off that baseball?

19:25.998 --> 19:27.708
Is that a real
baseball talk?

19:27.791 --> 19:30.127
Do you remember when I asked
you to pick a number?

19:30.210 --> 19:31.712
Yeah. I picked 7.

19:31.795 --> 19:33.839
Ha. The Mick.

19:33.922 --> 19:36.300
But it was also the number
of cruise missiles

19:36.383 --> 19:38.427
launched from
the USS Wendigo

19:38.510 --> 19:41.430
into an Iraqi village
at your command.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.432
-What?
-How does that feel?

19:43.515 --> 19:46.226
Knowing that you killed
all those people?

19:46.310 --> 19:48.353
I actually
don't feel anything.

19:48.437 --> 19:50.439
I didn't know you were
gonna do that.

19:50.522 --> 19:53.817
And you didn't know
Stan would throw Henderson

19:53.901 --> 19:55.068
off the plane.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.821
Oh, my God.
You're right!

19:57.905 --> 19:59.781
None of this is my fault!

19:59.865 --> 20:02.618
Cathy, you are a-mah-zing.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.912
Please.

20:04.995 --> 20:07.956
Cathy was both
my moms' names.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.166
Call me Coach.

20:09.249 --> 20:10.459
No.

20:10.542 --> 20:12.836
I'm gonna call you
"friend."

20:12.920 --> 20:14.755
Whose muddy cleats
are on the porch?

20:14.838 --> 20:16.548
-They're Coach Cathy's!
-Uh-huh.

20:16.632 --> 20:19.718
Coach Cathy, Stan.
She cured me!

20:19.801 --> 20:21.428
Okay. What?

20:21.511 --> 20:23.639
Coach Cathy, silly.

20:23.722 --> 20:26.600
The CIA grief counselor
you sent.

20:26.683 --> 20:28.352
Coach Cathy?

20:28.435 --> 20:29.937
She totally cured me,

20:30.020 --> 20:34.524
and I hit
a 90 mile-an-hour fastball!

20:35.484 --> 20:38.904
Oh, good.
That sounds real.

20:38.987 --> 20:41.949
So do you feel like
it's in your best interest,

20:42.032 --> 20:45.994
mental-health-wise, to keep up
this relationship with Cathy?

20:46.078 --> 20:48.789
Coach Cathy? With Coach?

20:48.872 --> 20:51.291
I don't know what
I'd do without her.

20:51.375 --> 20:53.835
Well, we don't want
to find that out, so...

20:53.919 --> 20:56.171
welcome to
our lives, Cathy.

20:57.547 --> 20:59.174
Quit shaking
her boob, Stan.

20:59.258 --> 21:00.259
She likes girls.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.177
Who doesn't?

21:02.261 --> 21:04.179
Bye!
Have a beautiful time!
