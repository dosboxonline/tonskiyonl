WEBVTT

00:04.796 --> 00:07.633
So many careers to choose from.

00:07.716 --> 00:09.760
I'm most excited
about the scientist.

00:10.010 --> 00:13.555
Scientists are truly working
on the front lines of discovery.

00:13.722 --> 00:16.266
Working on the front lines
of discovery

00:16.391 --> 00:17.935
is not what I do.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.771
All the good stuff,
that's all done by computers now.

00:20.854 --> 00:21.855
Oh.

00:22.105 --> 00:24.358
I see lots of cute animals every day.

00:24.775 --> 00:26.860
And I put almost all of them
to sleep.

00:27.402 --> 00:28.862
No matter how much I shower,

00:28.946 --> 00:30.906
I smell like I'm wearing
a flea collar.

00:31.073 --> 00:34.159
I got into being a cowboy
because it was manly.

00:34.243 --> 00:36.995
But, ironically, the harsh
bumping of the saddle

00:37.079 --> 00:39.498
has destroyed my dick and balls.

00:39.748 --> 00:41.416
I'm so tired of candy.

00:41.875 --> 00:44.920
Sometimes late at night,
I go to the kitchen

00:45.003 --> 00:47.297
and I eat spoonfuls of salt.

00:48.131 --> 00:50.008
I don't love my wife anymore.

00:50.843 --> 00:52.553
Because of the candy?

00:53.136 --> 00:54.221
Yes.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.348
A real astronaut!

00:56.431 --> 00:59.601
Okay, so,
I'm not an astronaut.

00:59.685 --> 01:03.105
- Oh!
- I'm a radio engineer.

01:04.106 --> 01:06.525
That's right, radio.

01:06.775 --> 01:08.944
Does anyone here
listen to radio?

01:10.863 --> 01:13.282
Free radios, kids!
Give it a try!

01:13.365 --> 01:14.658
It's like podcasts,

01:14.741 --> 01:18.036
but it works around
our schedule, not yours.

01:19.746 --> 01:21.999
My show is the morning-drive time,

01:22.082 --> 01:26.253
every day on WLNG 98.2.

01:26.336 --> 01:28.213
And if folks don't start listening,

01:28.297 --> 01:31.216
I'm gonna be homeless.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.809
Good morning, U.S.A.

01:40.893 --> 01:44.188
I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day

01:44.521 --> 01:47.357
The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face

01:47.441 --> 01:51.069
And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race

01:53.906 --> 01:56.992
Oh, boy, it's swell to say

01:57.075 --> 01:59.328
-Good...
-Good morning, U.S.A.

01:59.411 --> 02:00.412
Ah!

02:01.955 --> 02:04.708
Good morning, U.S.A.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.838
Is something the matter, Steve?

02:09.922 --> 02:12.633
You've barely touched
your canned corn and cornballs.

02:12.716 --> 02:15.511
I think it's that dang
career fair got me down.

02:15.594 --> 02:19.723
All the adults, their lives
seemed so sad and small.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.183
Oh, you must have misheard them.

02:21.266 --> 02:22.643
Being an adult is great.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.478
Oh! What's great about it?

02:24.561 --> 02:26.146
Well, there's, uh...

02:26.230 --> 02:27.606
You're peppering me
with questions.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.358
Meanwhile, my corn's getting cold.

02:29.441 --> 02:33.445
You know, I picked my career
at my high-school career fair.

02:35.697 --> 02:37.866
-Housewife?
-Circus manager.

02:37.950 --> 02:41.203
But... but you're not
a circus manager.

02:41.286 --> 02:43.830
It's a long process.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.587
I... I think she has
stopped talking.

02:50.879 --> 02:54.591
I don't have a career,
but Teddy Sraberg sure does.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.009
I'm Teddy Sraberg.

02:56.093 --> 02:59.513
I work in the adult-film industry,
but I don't do sex acts yet.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.265
I drive the BangVan.

03:01.348 --> 03:03.517
You know, the gray Econoline
that cruises around

03:03.600 --> 03:05.310
while hard-bodies bang
in the back.

03:05.394 --> 03:07.729
I didn't know you worked
for the 'Van!

03:07.813 --> 03:12.192
Ever since I got banned from MILF Catcher,
that's been like my main thing!

03:13.151 --> 03:15.821
Do you want to know what
I did to get banned

03:15.904 --> 03:17.614
from looking at a porn site?

03:17.823 --> 03:19.491
It's bad.

03:22.411 --> 03:24.705
Cilantro es cantante

03:24.788 --> 03:26.707
Cilantro es muy fam...

03:26.790 --> 03:29.918
Pizza overlord...

03:30.002 --> 03:32.379
Ow-ow-ow-ow!
Rocking Ronnie here

03:32.462 --> 03:34.047
hittin' you with...

03:34.131 --> 03:37.759
A career, a job...
that's all there is?

03:38.135 --> 03:40.721
You might think
that's all there is.

03:40.804 --> 03:43.056
Live, work, die.

03:43.307 --> 03:45.309
But that's not true.

03:45.392 --> 03:48.687
I'm Palmer Elymas,
and this is The Wondercabinet,

03:48.770 --> 03:52.149
an exploration of the hidden
mysteries of the universe.

03:52.232 --> 03:54.568
On tonight's show,
the pineal gland,

03:54.651 --> 03:58.030
a small sac of fluid located in
the center of the human brain.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.573
The third eye.

03:59.656 --> 04:02.993
The Ancient Egyptians believed
you could vibrate the pineal gland,

04:03.076 --> 04:05.454
allowing the consciousness
to move any direction

04:05.537 --> 04:08.498
in space and time,
astral projection.

04:08.582 --> 04:12.211
And every vertebrate in the world
has a pineal gland,

04:12.294 --> 04:14.546
except one, the hagfish.

04:14.838 --> 04:16.798
You are not a hagfish.

04:16.882 --> 04:19.843
- I'm not a hagfish.
- You're not!

04:19.927 --> 04:21.803
The powers that be have
just gunked up

04:21.887 --> 04:23.680
our pineal glands
with fluoride.

04:23.764 --> 04:26.558
Mm, fluoride. I don't know.

04:26.642 --> 04:27.851
Skeptical?

04:27.935 --> 04:29.853
Listen to this esteemed
list of people

04:29.937 --> 04:31.772
who believein astral projection.

04:31.855 --> 04:32.898
Ric Flair,

04:32.981 --> 04:34.650
Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake,

04:34.733 --> 04:36.235
one of The Bushwhackers,

04:36.318 --> 04:39.029
and Rene Descartes.

04:41.406 --> 04:44.660
As you all know,
I astral-project frequently.

04:44.743 --> 04:47.037
I've gone to the time
of dinosaurs.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.664
No feathers, by the way.

04:48.747 --> 04:51.458
Scientists get it wrong again!

04:51.542 --> 04:54.336
I've watched the collapse
of the last bit of matter

04:54.419 --> 04:56.588
in the universe
at the end of time.

04:56.672 --> 04:58.882
I know who Banksy actually is.

04:58.966 --> 05:00.425
It's "Captain" Lou Albano.

05:00.509 --> 05:05.097
He's not dead, by the way.
Scientists get it wrong again, again.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.558
You want to see the wonders
of the universe?

05:07.641 --> 05:11.228
Just put out your crystals,
vibrate your pineal gland,

05:11.311 --> 05:14.064
and snap, you're off.

05:14.898 --> 05:17.401
Since all my listeners
are now successfully

05:17.484 --> 05:20.112
astral-projecting,
I'll take this private moment

05:20.195 --> 05:22.239
to say a shameful secret.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.949
I have, in the past,

05:24.032 --> 05:26.577
treated the Sports Illustrated
Swimsuit Edition

05:27.160 --> 05:28.328
as pornography.

05:32.207 --> 05:34.418
Excuse me. Are you Mr. Sraberg?

05:34.501 --> 05:35.878
So you're my trainee,

05:35.961 --> 05:38.380
here to learn how to drive
the famous BangVan?

05:38.463 --> 05:39.464
Yeah.

05:39.548 --> 05:41.842
I mean, I'm hoping to get in the back seat
at some point,

05:41.925 --> 05:43.218
do some acting, you know?

05:43.302 --> 05:44.303
Get in line.

05:44.386 --> 05:45.762
I've been the driver forever,

05:45.846 --> 05:48.265
so if anybody's getting that tap
on the shoulder, it's me.

05:48.515 --> 05:49.850
Beautiful street, right?

05:49.933 --> 05:51.852
It's not just the humping
people enjoy.

05:51.935 --> 05:53.854
It's the scenery
going by the windows.

05:53.937 --> 05:55.230
It's a huge part, I believe.

05:55.314 --> 05:56.648
-Shhhh!
-Shh!

05:56.732 --> 05:58.233
Just because you work
in a BangVan

05:58.317 --> 06:00.152
doesn't mean
you can't be professional.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.529
Rule number one:
eyes on the road.

06:02.613 --> 06:04.823
You're gonna be tempted
to sneak peeks in the mirror,

06:04.907 --> 06:06.200
but don't do it.

06:06.283 --> 06:08.660
Oh, damn, that's hot!

06:09.745 --> 06:12.039
Wow. Guys,
I ran a red just then.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.002
Is this meth, Steve?

06:17.461 --> 06:21.507
It's my rose quartz,
to relax my neural pathways.

06:21.590 --> 06:23.759
I've been listening to this
radio show hosted by Palmer...

06:23.842 --> 06:27.179
Radio is dead, Steve.
Stern is on SiriusXM now.

06:28.013 --> 06:29.389
Astral projection?

06:29.473 --> 06:31.767
Oh, Steve,
that's New Age garbage.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.937
And a book? When TV?
What are you thinking?

06:35.020 --> 06:37.523
Palmer says everyone used
to astral-project,

06:37.606 --> 06:40.275
until our pineal glands
got gunked up with fluoride...

06:40.359 --> 06:41.860
The pineal gland is a myth!

06:41.944 --> 06:44.988
Well, no one disputes
the pineal gland exists.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.657
People just aren't sure
what the gland does.

06:46.740 --> 06:49.409
Gland this, gland that.
Let's not talk about glands.

06:49.493 --> 06:51.036
Let's talk about careers.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.788
You could be anything, Steve.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.373
Why, you could be
an endocrinologist,

06:54.456 --> 06:55.499
whatever that is.

06:55.582 --> 06:56.959
That's... Are you...

06:57.209 --> 06:59.002
That's a doctor
who studies glands.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.337
There's that word again.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.172
I'm afraid I'm going to have
to forbid you

07:02.256 --> 07:03.757
from listening
to that radio show.

07:03.841 --> 07:07.135
But he's the only adult I know
who has any wonder in his life!

07:07.219 --> 07:10.514
Pff! You don't need astral projection
to have wonder in your life.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.432
Okay. Then where do I find it?

07:12.516 --> 07:15.811
Um, um, look, you know
I know the answer,

07:15.894 --> 07:18.480
but, uh, I'm tired,
you're tired,

07:18.564 --> 07:19.857
and I don't want
to be up all night

07:19.940 --> 07:21.483
explaining it to you
when you're not gonna get it.

07:21.567 --> 07:23.110
Now go to sleep
and have sweet dreams,

07:23.193 --> 07:25.279
or we're gonna have
big problems, mister.

07:26.488 --> 07:28.448
It's 4:30!

07:32.828 --> 07:35.998
Stupid Dad. Gah!
I'm shaking with anger.

07:36.582 --> 07:39.293
Whoa! Whoa! What's happening?

07:39.710 --> 07:41.920
Help me!
Oh, God!

07:42.004 --> 07:43.213
Help me!

07:44.423 --> 07:46.341
Hi.
I'm DJ Karen Shipley,

07:46.425 --> 07:49.428
filling in for Palmer,
who suspiciously didn't show up.

07:49.636 --> 07:51.346
- Oh, my God!
- It's unlike him,

07:51.430 --> 07:53.473
and he hasn't returned
any of our calls.

07:53.557 --> 07:55.601
But, anyhoo,
I'm just gonna play

07:55.809 --> 07:58.228
"I'd Really Love
To See You Tonight."

07:58.312 --> 08:01.607
I think... I think
I astral-projected!

08:01.690 --> 08:02.941
And... and that room.

08:03.025 --> 08:05.110
That must have been
where Palmer is.

08:05.194 --> 08:06.737
He was calling for help.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.405
I have to save Palmer!

08:08.488 --> 08:11.158
Not much, how about you?

08:11.241 --> 08:12.951
As soon as they play a bad song.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.370
I'm not sure why I

08:20.209 --> 08:22.169
Thank you all
for coming so quickly.

08:22.252 --> 08:23.837
I apologize for the late hour.

08:23.921 --> 08:25.923
If we're aiming to party,

08:26.006 --> 08:28.926
look what Barry got
his little hands on.

08:29.051 --> 08:32.179
My dad's friend left his
fringe jacket at the house,

08:32.262 --> 08:34.181
and this was inside.

08:34.264 --> 08:36.266
Palmer Elymas
is in trouble, guys.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.018
Palmer Elymas?

08:38.101 --> 08:39.895
That's your
talking goldfish, yeah?

08:39.978 --> 08:41.772
He's the host of
The Wondercabinet.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.733
Someone's attacking him
or kidnapping him.

08:44.816 --> 08:47.569
He... he knows too much.
He's saying too much.

08:47.653 --> 08:48.987
About who?

08:50.614 --> 08:51.949
Big Fluoride!

08:52.032 --> 08:53.742
Should we call the police then?

08:53.825 --> 08:56.036
-We can't call the police.
-You're damn right!

08:56.119 --> 08:58.580
Not when I have this
much party powder on me.

08:58.664 --> 09:02.084
I guess we can hide it
in our noses.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.836
The police
will never believe me.

09:03.919 --> 09:06.088
I only know Palmer's
in trouble because...

09:07.214 --> 09:08.549
I astral-projected.

09:08.632 --> 09:10.008
Whose I cannot....

09:10.092 --> 09:13.178
-You what?
-Everything Palmer said is true!

09:13.262 --> 09:15.931
I actually left my body
and traveled

09:16.014 --> 09:17.391
to what must be Palmer's house.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.518
You want us to go
to some guy's house?

09:19.601 --> 09:21.854
He's the only one talking
about how incredible

09:21.937 --> 09:23.188
life can actually be.

09:23.522 --> 09:25.816
The radio station
has to have his address.

09:25.899 --> 09:26.984
To the bikes!

09:29.987 --> 09:31.488
No one wants my cocaine.

09:31.572 --> 09:33.198
Feel like a frickin' idiot!

09:34.908 --> 09:35.909
Hey, Steve.

09:35.993 --> 09:38.203
Sounds like you're watching
Revenge of the Nerds in here.

09:38.287 --> 09:40.622
Let's start from the begi...
He's gone.

09:40.956 --> 09:42.833
Initiate Expert Tracker mode.

09:44.418 --> 09:46.879
This open window
is the perfect place to stand

09:46.962 --> 09:48.338
and wonder how he got out.

09:48.714 --> 09:50.174
We've got to get there fast.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.217
Let's cut through the cemetery.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.639
I say we cross the playground
where we saw that condom,

09:57.723 --> 09:59.391
then shoot down Mohawk Drive.

09:59.474 --> 10:00.893
Mohawk, perfect.

10:00.976 --> 10:03.103
The tree roots pushed up
all the sidewalks,

10:03.187 --> 10:04.980
turning them into little ramps.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.356
Since time is of the essence,

10:06.440 --> 10:09.026
we'll only take five minutes
to do totally sick bike jumps.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.194
-Ten.
-Deal!

10:10.277 --> 10:12.112
-Fifteen!
-Even better deal!

10:12.196 --> 10:14.865
Whoa! That guy almost hit me!

10:14.948 --> 10:16.783
I mean, I know it's my ticket.

10:16.867 --> 10:19.411
It's just... boy, you know,
I don't make much,

10:19.494 --> 10:22.080
and this big number here...
that's got me sweating.

10:22.164 --> 10:23.707
What does everybody
in the back think?

10:23.790 --> 10:25.042
It... it should be me
that pays it

10:25.125 --> 10:26.126
'cause I'm the one
that ran the red?

10:26.210 --> 10:27.419
Quiet, Teddy!

10:27.503 --> 10:29.671
Hey, new guy,
you ready to jump back here,

10:29.755 --> 10:30.756
show us your stuff?

10:30.839 --> 10:31.965
Yes, sir!

10:32.299 --> 10:33.634
Ooh!

10:33.717 --> 10:35.469
Are you kidding me?
I quit!

10:35.552 --> 10:36.929
Good luck getting people

10:37.012 --> 10:38.680
to watch sex in a parked van.

10:40.182 --> 10:42.976
I'm unquitting
because this just proves

10:43.060 --> 10:45.771
someone from up here can
actually make it back there.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.523
Shut up, Teddy!

10:50.108 --> 10:51.652
The radio station.

10:51.944 --> 10:54.196
Palmer's home address
has to be in there.

10:54.571 --> 10:55.989
We've just got to get
past the guard.

10:56.198 --> 10:59.409
Let's forget this
radio-station business

10:59.493 --> 11:02.412
and get a little high?

11:02.746 --> 11:04.498
Get high! That's it!

11:04.831 --> 11:07.251
There's a door up on the roof
of the radio station.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.086
We just need to build
a big-enough jump.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.712
A jump, you say?

11:15.968 --> 11:17.886
- Here goes noth...
- What do we have here?

11:17.970 --> 11:18.971
We're busted!

11:19.054 --> 11:21.431
You little troublemakers
are going away for a long...

11:21.515 --> 11:22.516
A ramp?

11:22.599 --> 11:25.143
I haven't gone off a ramp
since I was a kid!

11:25.435 --> 11:26.478
Watch this!

11:27.479 --> 11:30.524
Time to fly like an eagle, baby.

11:30.774 --> 11:32.943
I broke my ass!

11:33.026 --> 11:34.695
I'm so embarrassed!

11:34.778 --> 11:37.614
They're gonna put me
in a big plaster diaper!

11:37.698 --> 11:40.409
Oh, no!

11:50.752 --> 11:52.087
You came!

11:52.588 --> 11:55.048
You're interested in radio!

11:56.258 --> 11:58.635
Don't push me into
the closet I sleep in!

12:02.431 --> 12:05.642
Palmer Elymas, the Vista View
Apartments on Third Street.

12:05.726 --> 12:09.771
Mm, is there someone special
you'd like to dedicate this love song to?

12:09.855 --> 12:12.357
A very important
woman in my life.

12:12.691 --> 12:15.569
Just thinking about her
makes my heart race.

12:15.652 --> 12:18.197
Love is just so, so special.

12:18.280 --> 12:20.490
She's a cartoon bird
with big, red lips

12:20.574 --> 12:22.868
that's in these
car-insurance commercials.

12:23.035 --> 12:24.828
She sounds incredible.

12:24.912 --> 12:26.622
Here's Peter Cetera's
"Glory of Love"

12:26.705 --> 12:28.415
from The Karate Kid II
soundtrack.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.295
This tree is dry.

12:33.670 --> 12:36.381
The roots have been
squeezed of moisture by kids

12:36.465 --> 12:38.342
doing jumps off the sidewalk.

12:41.303 --> 12:45.015
Four kids to be precise,
three normals and a large.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.517
They're heading east.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.852
Whoa! This guy's driving
on the sidewalk!

12:49.061 --> 12:50.270
And I'll tell you
something else.

12:50.354 --> 12:51.688
People want to see someone

12:51.772 --> 12:54.024
with a little paunch,
a guy who works for a living

12:54.107 --> 12:55.192
have sex in the van.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.360
Fine. Let's go.

12:56.443 --> 12:57.945
R-R-Right now?

12:58.028 --> 13:00.322
-Yes.
-But... but who's gonna drive?

13:00.405 --> 13:01.490
We'll park.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.242
People need to see
the trees going by.

13:03.325 --> 13:04.618
Tonight or never.

13:04.826 --> 13:06.954
Okay, okay.
But I'm frizzing out.

13:07.037 --> 13:09.915
At least let me wet down my hair
in a gas-station bathroom.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.458
You've got to let me
make it nice.

13:11.542 --> 13:12.876
Please!

13:17.464 --> 13:21.760
Hmm. Makeshift ramp,
a loser with broken butt.

13:22.302 --> 13:23.303
I've solved it.

13:23.387 --> 13:25.472
This fool was trying
to relive his youth.

13:25.889 --> 13:27.349
Maybe to impress some kids?

13:27.808 --> 13:30.143
Judging by how dry
his mouth feels,

13:30.435 --> 13:33.146
I'd say the boys left here
about 45 minutes ago.

13:33.230 --> 13:35.315
Get your hands out of my mouth!

13:35.607 --> 13:37.401
If you're looking for those
boys, they went...

13:37.484 --> 13:41.029
Stop! I want to track them
only by seeing how moist things are.

13:44.616 --> 13:48.245
Okay, best-case scenario,
Palmer's tied up inside.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.622
So we can't just knock on the door.

13:50.706 --> 13:51.790
Barry, no!

13:51.874 --> 13:54.084
What if the agents
of Big Fluoride are...

13:54.543 --> 13:56.879
Palmer? Y-You're okay!

13:56.962 --> 13:58.463
I thought something
happened to you.

13:58.547 --> 14:00.215
Something did happen to me!

14:00.299 --> 14:02.342
I have a toothache,
which is crazy,

14:02.426 --> 14:06.471
because I wipe my teeth with
a hand towel three times a day!

14:06.555 --> 14:08.265
Uh, how do you know who I am?

14:08.348 --> 14:11.018
From The Wondercabinet.
I'm a fan.

14:11.101 --> 14:12.102
And guess what.

14:12.186 --> 14:14.646
I astral-projected
right into your apartment.

14:15.772 --> 14:17.691
Where... where are
the astral charts?

14:17.774 --> 14:19.109
Where are the crystals?

14:19.193 --> 14:23.197
It's just a bunch of posters
of race cars?

14:23.280 --> 14:25.032
Yeah! You can't even drive

14:25.115 --> 14:27.159
this one on the street,
it's so fast.

14:27.534 --> 14:28.785
I-Is there another room?

14:28.869 --> 14:31.830
Another room? I work in radio.

14:31.914 --> 14:34.208
Who do you think I am?
King Ralph?

14:34.291 --> 14:35.876
I astral-projected!

14:36.001 --> 14:38.212
Really? That's wild!

14:38.420 --> 14:39.713
I'd love to do that.

14:40.005 --> 14:41.590
But... but you have.

14:41.965 --> 14:43.467
You said so on your show.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.885
I just made that up.

14:45.469 --> 14:47.429
So I didn't astral-project.

14:48.138 --> 14:50.474
And you're just another
sad adult.

14:50.974 --> 14:56.146
I am so sick of sad adults!

14:58.232 --> 14:59.775
My Lamborghini Veneno!

14:59.858 --> 15:01.693
Steve, he's okay.

15:01.777 --> 15:03.320
Why are you so upset?

15:03.529 --> 15:05.113
We're supposed to pick a path,

15:05.197 --> 15:07.241
but they all lead
to the same place.

15:07.324 --> 15:09.034
A small, sad life!

15:09.117 --> 15:11.411
I thought there was another way,
but there isn't!

15:11.495 --> 15:13.789
They should call you boys
Hurricane Katrina,

15:13.872 --> 15:16.291
'cause you've been leaving
water all over town.

15:16.500 --> 15:17.793
And you!

15:18.126 --> 15:20.838
You want me to live
the smallest, worst life of all...

15:20.921 --> 15:21.922
yours!

15:22.005 --> 15:26.093
You're a hagfish!

15:30.097 --> 15:33.767
Whoa! Is that his pineal gland?

15:33.851 --> 15:34.852
Steve!

15:35.394 --> 15:36.395
Steve!

15:57.791 --> 15:59.168
The astral plane.

15:59.668 --> 16:00.669
I'm here.

16:01.044 --> 16:03.213
Oh, God, I'm actually here.

16:03.297 --> 16:04.506
It's real.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.217
Okay, how does it work?
How does it work?

16:07.676 --> 16:12.139
I should be able to just think
of a place and go, say Paris.

16:12.598 --> 16:15.350
Magnifique!

16:15.434 --> 16:19.813
I can go anywhere,
even Chimdale.

16:21.648 --> 16:23.650
Wow! Chimdale!

16:23.984 --> 16:26.195
It's like Paris on steroids.

16:26.528 --> 16:29.948
It's all so beautiful!
I want to see everything.

16:30.032 --> 16:32.993
I want to see everything
Palmer lied about getting to see,

16:33.076 --> 16:35.662
to every time and every place,

16:35.746 --> 16:38.415
to the last moment
of the universe!

16:43.670 --> 16:44.671
Sad ending.

16:45.005 --> 16:47.591
Got to stop reading
the last page of a book first.

16:47.674 --> 16:52.179
Now show me dinosaurs!

16:54.848 --> 16:56.183
Incredible!

16:56.266 --> 16:58.685
The feathers are
so unpleasant, though.

17:03.482 --> 17:04.691
Bu-gawk!

17:05.359 --> 17:06.485
Oh, just awful.

17:06.860 --> 17:10.489
Now show me everything!

17:50.571 --> 17:53.365
There we go.
Hey, you're great.

17:53.448 --> 17:56.285
You're a nice guy.
People want to see you do things.

17:56.368 --> 17:57.995
Did you get in shape
the way you wanted?

17:58.078 --> 17:59.329
No, of course not.

17:59.413 --> 18:01.164
Did you eat like you were
an actor trying

18:01.248 --> 18:02.374
to gain 100 pounds for a role?

18:02.457 --> 18:03.667
Yeah. So what?

18:03.750 --> 18:07.171
Now are you ready to smash? Yeah.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.922
I said, are you ready to smash?

18:09.006 --> 18:11.008
Yes! Let me really hear it.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.843
I'm gonna smash!

18:12.926 --> 18:14.303
Yeah!

18:16.847 --> 18:19.558
No! H... Help!

18:19.766 --> 18:21.435
Can anyone hear me?

18:21.518 --> 18:22.728
Where the hell is Teddy?

18:22.811 --> 18:24.521
I'm in here! My hair is wet.

18:24.605 --> 18:25.939
I'm ready for sex!

18:26.023 --> 18:27.191
You know,
I was thinking,

18:27.274 --> 18:29.276
what if we just used
a green screen

18:29.359 --> 18:31.111
instead of driving around
all the time?

18:31.195 --> 18:32.654
No! That's terrible!

18:32.738 --> 18:34.364
That could totally work.

18:34.448 --> 18:37.367
No! Why can I hear you
and you can't hear me?

18:37.451 --> 18:39.077
We wouldn't need
a driver at all!

18:39.161 --> 18:40.913
I'm having a panic attack!

18:43.415 --> 18:45.083
Well, Roger's at it again.

18:45.417 --> 18:46.418
What next?

18:46.502 --> 18:47.711
Oh!

18:47.794 --> 18:49.296
That strange room.

18:49.379 --> 18:50.714
I forgot about that.

18:51.089 --> 18:53.258
If it wasn't Palmer's room,
what was it?

18:55.385 --> 18:57.304
I'm back! This is it!

18:57.638 --> 18:59.181
But where is this?

18:59.598 --> 19:01.600
Let's take it back in time.

19:05.062 --> 19:07.648
It's Dad's study.

19:11.318 --> 19:12.444
Where are you?

19:12.528 --> 19:13.779
Where did you go?

19:26.250 --> 19:27.543
Help me!

19:27.626 --> 19:29.753
Oh, God, help me!

19:29.837 --> 19:31.797
Dad was the one
calling for help...

19:32.256 --> 19:33.549
to save me.

19:37.135 --> 19:39.429
Steve! You came back!

19:39.513 --> 19:41.265
Be careful.
That's Waterford glass.

19:41.348 --> 19:43.517
I've traveled so far, Dad,

19:43.600 --> 19:45.936
to every corner
of this universe.

19:46.019 --> 19:47.437
I've seen so much.

19:47.521 --> 19:49.356
Did I end up getting cast
as Hamilton

19:49.439 --> 19:51.817
-in the movie version of Hamilton?
-No.

19:51.942 --> 19:54.278
Well, I owe Tuttle
a million dollars.

19:54.361 --> 19:55.904
There's something I need to say.

19:55.988 --> 19:57.531
No. You're back.

19:57.823 --> 20:00.117
We don't have to talk
ever again.

20:00.200 --> 20:02.494
I apologize for calling you
a hagfish

20:02.578 --> 20:04.204
and saying your life was small,

20:04.288 --> 20:06.540
for thinking anyone's life
was small.

20:06.623 --> 20:09.251
I wanted something infinite,
but I didn't realize

20:09.334 --> 20:10.878
I had it right here.

20:10.961 --> 20:14.047
A love so big it moved us
across time and space

20:14.131 --> 20:15.549
to find each other.

20:15.632 --> 20:18.302
Is that what you couldn't
figure out how to say, Dad?

20:18.385 --> 20:20.429
Is that what you wanted me
to understand?

20:20.512 --> 20:23.390
No. That's stupid.

20:23.473 --> 20:26.810
And even if it was what I felt,
how dare you say it out loud.

20:27.728 --> 20:28.854
Don't touch me.

20:29.188 --> 20:30.522
Get away from me!

20:32.649 --> 20:34.860
What's say we pop open
that third eye,

20:34.943 --> 20:37.196
do a little
astral projecting together.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.868
I'm haunting my own house.

20:44.828 --> 20:45.871
Boo!

20:47.831 --> 20:49.124
Boo!

20:49.208 --> 20:50.918
Dad, I told you
they can't see us.

20:51.001 --> 20:53.086
What's the point then?
This sucks.

20:53.170 --> 20:55.380
I'll show you something
that doesn't suck.

20:56.882 --> 20:58.467
Whoa! Chimdale.

20:58.759 --> 21:00.677
Now, this I could get used to.

21:00.761 --> 21:01.929
Right?

21:02.304 --> 21:04.223
Bye. Have a great time.
