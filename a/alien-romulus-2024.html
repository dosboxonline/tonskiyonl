<div id="movie-descr">
In 2142, at the Jackson colony, Rain Carradine lives with her synthetic "brother" Andy that was reprogrammed by her father with the prime directive to protect her after the death of her parents. The Weyland-Yutani Corporation that administrates the colony forces the colonists to stay in Jackson prolonging the contracts of miners and farmers keeping them like slaves. When Rain's ex-boyfriend Tyler has his contract extended by the corporation, he convinces Rain to join his team, formed by his sister Kay, who is secretly pregnant, their cousin Bjorn and his sister Navarro, who is adopted, to travel to an abandoned station to flee to the planet Yvaga.<br /><br />
They need Andy to interact with the computer system and they also need to recover the stasis chambers of the suspended animation for a nine-year trip to Yvaga. They go to the station and Andy and Bjorn realize that the chambers need cryogenic fuel for the trip. They go with Andy and accidentally unleash alien creatures, and there is a lockdown of the section. Rain uses the chip of the synthetic Rook that is damaged to update Andy to have access to all the functions of the station, but he becomes loyal to Weyland-Yutani Corporation and Rain is relegated to a second plane. But soon the creatures attack one by one of the Rain's friends. Will someone survive the alien creatures?
