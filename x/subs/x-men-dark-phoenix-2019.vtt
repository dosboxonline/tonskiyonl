WEBVTT

00:48.674 --> 00:50.540
Jean: Who are we?

00:50.634 --> 00:54.218
Are we simply what others
want us to be?

00:54.304 --> 00:58.344
Are we destined to a fate
beyond our control?

00:59.560 --> 01:01.643
Or can we evolve?

01:01.728 --> 01:06.018
Become... something more?

01:06.108 --> 01:07.335
She'll find the note

01:07.359 --> 01:12.445
I left hangin' on her door

01:12.531 --> 01:13.897
can you change the station?

01:13.991 --> 01:16.233
When the song's over, honey.

01:16.326 --> 01:19.069
You said that two songs ago.

01:19.162 --> 01:21.700
John: You know this is
a classic, right?

01:21.790 --> 01:23.998
Elaine: Okay, how about
I make you a promise?

01:24.084 --> 01:25.996
When you're old enough to drive,

01:26.086 --> 01:28.874
you can listen to whatever
music you want. Hmm?

01:28.964 --> 01:31.126
That a deal?

01:34.469 --> 01:36.882
- John.
- Wasn't me.

01:37.848 --> 01:40.056
Jean, was that... did you?

01:40.142 --> 01:42.099
I didn't do anything.

01:43.729 --> 01:46.642
give me a call

01:50.319 --> 01:54.029
- Jean, what are you...
- I... I don't know. It's not me.

01:59.703 --> 02:01.285
Quiet.

02:03.915 --> 02:05.406
Quiet.

02:08.503 --> 02:09.835
Quiet!

03:15.195 --> 03:17.232
Male doctor: She doesn't have
a scratch on her.

03:17.322 --> 03:19.154
Female doctor: No internal injuries.

03:21.118 --> 03:23.451
Male doctor: And you're sure
she was in the car?

03:23.537 --> 03:24.778
Female doctor: Yeah.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.451
Male doctor: Who's gonna tell her?

03:32.003 --> 03:33.369
Thank you.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.253
Hello.

03:38.343 --> 03:40.175
Where are my parents?

03:43.223 --> 03:44.634
My name's Charles Xavier, and...

03:44.725 --> 03:46.432
They're dead.

03:46.518 --> 03:47.850
Aren't they?

03:51.857 --> 03:53.473
Yes, they are.

03:53.567 --> 03:57.186
And I'm very sorry
to have to tell you that.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.489
So what happens to me now?

04:06.288 --> 04:07.824
Well, that's why I'm here, actually.

04:08.790 --> 04:10.201
You see, I have a school

04:10.292 --> 04:13.626
that is for young people,
who are like you.

04:13.712 --> 04:14.919
Special.

04:15.005 --> 04:17.292
Special is just
a nice word for...

04:17.382 --> 04:20.295
Weird? Or crazy?

04:20.385 --> 04:21.921
Yep.

04:22.012 --> 04:24.004
Yep, sometimes it is.

04:24.890 --> 04:25.971
Ooh.

04:26.057 --> 04:28.219
Sometimes, it can be a word

04:28.310 --> 04:30.427
used to describe people
who are significant.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.352
Or amazing. Or...

04:32.439 --> 04:35.398
Or just... just really cool.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.523
You've got gifts, Jean.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.440
Do you know what?

04:46.745 --> 04:48.907
Take this pen, right.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.705
It's something that...

04:51.792 --> 04:54.910
Well, actually, just take it.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.460
It's a gift.

05:00.509 --> 05:02.842
Now, you could choose to draw

05:02.928 --> 05:04.760
a really good picture
with that...

05:04.846 --> 05:09.591
Or you could use it
to poke someone's eyes out.

05:09.684 --> 05:12.973
But either way,
it's still just a pen.

05:13.063 --> 05:15.771
It's just a gift.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.224
And what you choose
to do with your gift,

05:18.318 --> 05:20.901
well, that's entirely up to you.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.943
But if you want to use it
to do good stuff...

05:25.909 --> 05:28.447
Well, I can help.

05:29.579 --> 05:31.866
You're not like
the other doctors.

05:34.543 --> 05:35.829
No.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.919
And you're not like
the other patients.

06:06.116 --> 06:07.732
Charles: What do you think?

06:10.328 --> 06:11.785
I can't stay here.

06:13.623 --> 06:15.580
Okay. Why not?

06:15.667 --> 06:17.408
It's too nice.

06:18.169 --> 06:20.035
I...

06:21.506 --> 06:24.340
- I break things.
- Well, how does this sound:

06:24.426 --> 06:27.635
If you break something,
anything, I can fix it.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.428
Not anything.

06:30.307 --> 06:31.889
I can help you.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.995
I can help you so that you never
have to break things ever again.

06:37.230 --> 06:38.812
You think you can fix me too.

06:39.357 --> 06:40.689
No.

06:44.529 --> 06:49.024
No, because you are not broken.

07:05.216 --> 07:08.675
Launch announcer: Ten,
nine, eight, seven,

07:08.762 --> 07:14.759
six, five, four,
three, two, one...

07:38.750 --> 07:39.852
Astronaut 1: Engines
throttling up.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.583
Three engines now at 104%.

07:43.713 --> 07:46.672
Hey, I'm...
I'm picking something up here.

07:47.759 --> 07:50.467
Ma'am, I've got something
on sat six.

07:53.473 --> 07:55.473
Astronaut 2: Houston,
we have a problem.

07:59.187 --> 08:01.707
Newsman: Space shuttle endeavour
has encountered problems on its mission.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.542
- I know what you're thinking.
- That's my trick.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.419
And the answer is no.
The jet can't get that high.

08:05.443 --> 08:08.060
Even with the new booster rockets
and all your modifications?

08:08.154 --> 08:10.612
They're built for acceleration,
not elevation, okay?

08:10.699 --> 08:13.567
Not this. No.

08:13.660 --> 08:15.429
NASA official: They've lost
thrust vector control.

08:15.453 --> 08:17.740
Trajectory settings are irregular,

08:17.831 --> 08:19.914
likely from the constant engine burn.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.708
Oxygen generation is down...

08:22.794 --> 08:24.956
Yes? Yes, this is he.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.373
- Charles?
- Mr. President.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.254
Are you seeing this on TV?

08:31.344 --> 08:32.926
Yes, I'm watching now.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.254
Hank?

08:38.268 --> 08:39.304
Yeah.

08:45.233 --> 08:46.565
Raven: It's a simple extraction.

08:46.651 --> 08:47.858
We go into space,

08:47.944 --> 08:49.731
we get the astronauts,
we bring them home.

08:49.821 --> 08:52.359
- Any questions?
- Yeah, like a thousand.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.815
We don't have time
for a thousand.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.024
So we're going to space?

08:55.118 --> 08:57.110
Yes, Kurt,
we are going into space.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.695
We're doing space missions now.
Cool.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.246
Will the x-jet
even get that high?

09:01.332 --> 09:03.790
- Well, technically, the...
- It will get us there.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.288
Let's go.

09:09.841 --> 09:11.332
Are you okay with this?

09:11.426 --> 09:13.839
I forget sometimes
you can read minds.

09:13.928 --> 09:15.339
I didn't need to read your mind.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.763
It's written all over your face.

09:17.849 --> 09:20.762
You tell me it's good,
it's good.

09:20.852 --> 09:23.014
If anything goes wrong,

09:23.104 --> 09:24.720
I'll turn us around
in a heartbeat.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.564
I know you will.

09:52.884 --> 09:55.126
Newsman: A second ship
has been spotted in the sky.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.866
Newswoman: We are being told the president

09:58.890 --> 10:01.633
has called in the aid of the X-Men.

10:29.003 --> 10:31.666
Ladies and gentlemen of NASA,
this is the voice of Charles Xavier.

10:31.756 --> 10:33.873
Could somebody please
apprise me of the situation?

10:33.967 --> 10:36.050
We were picking up solar flares.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.549
We believe the heat
shorted out their electricity.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.925
They lost control,
communication, orientation,

10:41.015 --> 10:42.597
pretty much everything.

10:42.684 --> 10:45.051
Not to worry, mission control.
Help is on the way.

10:57.115 --> 11:00.529
I think this is not as much
fun as I thought it would be.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.184
Raven: That's a solar flare?

11:31.274 --> 11:33.561
Hank: I've never seen
a reading like this.

11:53.796 --> 11:56.288
The orientation thruster's misfiring.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.250
- That cabin won't hold for long.
- Kurt, can you get in there?

11:59.344 --> 12:01.961
It's spinning too fast.
I can't see inside the window.

12:02.055 --> 12:04.172
Scott, I need you
to blast that thruster,

12:04.265 --> 12:05.881
slow down the spin.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.744
Kurt, take Peter. Go!

12:33.253 --> 12:34.835
Raven: Storm, seal those cracks.

12:42.178 --> 12:44.090
Be right back.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.810
Oh, shit.

13:04.701 --> 13:06.512
- Strap in, we're headed home.
- Astronaut: Wait.

13:06.536 --> 13:08.402
Our commander, he's not here.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.037
He was in the airlock
working on the thruster.

13:15.253 --> 13:17.165
The heat signature's
rising fast.

13:17.255 --> 13:19.372
I can't hold it any longer.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.128
We gotta get out of here.
I said strap in.

13:22.218 --> 13:24.631
No, raven. No.
We're not leaving anyone behind.

13:24.721 --> 13:27.054
I am not putting this team
in more danger.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.132
What about their team?

13:29.225 --> 13:30.625
Jean can hold
that shuttle together.

13:30.685 --> 13:32.517
Can't you, Jean?

13:32.603 --> 13:35.767
You know you can do anything
you set your mind to.

13:35.857 --> 13:38.565
I can hold the ship together
but not from here.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.064
- I need to get inside.
- The heat's spiking.

13:41.154 --> 13:42.965
We've got less than a minute
till those flares hit.

13:42.989 --> 13:44.321
She said she can do it.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.316
Thirty seconds.

13:51.164 --> 13:52.780
Count it down. Go.

14:13.061 --> 14:14.723
We got 20 seconds.

14:24.197 --> 14:25.278
Ten...

14:25.365 --> 14:27.357
Nine, eight...

14:27.450 --> 14:29.157
Seven, six...

14:29.952 --> 14:30.952
Five...

14:31.287 --> 14:32.448
Four...

14:32.538 --> 14:33.745
Three...

14:33.831 --> 14:34.992
Two...

14:35.083 --> 14:36.083
One.

14:43.466 --> 14:45.378
Scott: Where's Jean?
Kurt, where is she?

14:45.468 --> 14:48.711
- Where is she?
- I'm sorry!

14:52.475 --> 14:53.886
Brace for impact.

16:38.789 --> 16:39.950
Is every...

16:41.042 --> 16:42.533
Is everybody okay?

16:43.211 --> 16:45.703
Yeah, we're okay.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.212
So let's go home.

17:02.605 --> 17:04.346
- Yay, X-Men! Woo!
- Yeah!

17:09.570 --> 17:11.482
Yeah! X-Men!

17:33.553 --> 17:35.840
Charles: That's enough,
boys and girls. That's enough.

17:37.473 --> 17:40.932
The X-Men have today done
an incredibly brave thing.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.761
They've once again proved to humanity
exactly why they need us,

17:43.854 --> 17:46.016
people like yourselves.

17:46.107 --> 17:47.939
The president sends his regards,

17:48.025 --> 17:50.062
as well as his
heartfelt gratitude.

17:50.152 --> 17:53.896
And, as for myself,
I've never been prouder.

17:54.949 --> 17:57.862
Enjoy yourselves.
You certainly deserve it.

17:57.952 --> 17:59.159
In fact, you all do.

17:59.245 --> 18:00.611
No more class,
the end of the day.

18:03.541 --> 18:04.541
Jean?

18:06.460 --> 18:08.952
You gave us quite a scare up there.
How are you feeling?

18:10.131 --> 18:12.874
Actually, I...
I feel fine.

18:12.967 --> 18:15.004
- Hank?
- Yeah?

18:15.094 --> 18:16.196
Would you take a look at Jean?

18:16.220 --> 18:18.553
Standard medical
for anyone injured in the field.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.005
Thank you.

18:22.143 --> 18:24.977
Raven: You know, the president
was almost sending his condolences.

18:25.062 --> 18:28.646
- She should be dead.
- Thankfully, she's not.

18:31.569 --> 18:33.105
I basically did everything.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.562
I mean, Jean did a little,
like towards the end,

18:35.656 --> 18:37.363
but it was mostly all me.

18:41.495 --> 18:43.111
You put us in danger, Charles.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.039
You put those kids in danger.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.294
They're not kids anymore, raven.

18:51.505 --> 18:54.873
And I care about their safety
just as much as you do.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.129
Are you sure about that?

18:57.219 --> 18:59.802
'Cause we're taking bigger
and bigger risks.

18:59.889 --> 19:00.970
And for what?

19:01.057 --> 19:04.095
Please, tell me it's not your ego.

19:04.185 --> 19:05.892
Being on the cover of magazines,

19:05.978 --> 19:08.015
getting a medal from the president.

19:08.105 --> 19:09.471
You like it, don't you?

19:09.565 --> 19:11.522
As opposed to being
hunted and despised?

19:11.609 --> 19:12.975
Well, you know, actually, I do.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.152
It's all just a means
to an end, raven.

19:15.237 --> 19:17.775
- What end is that?
- Keeping us safe.

19:17.865 --> 19:19.259
You should understand
better than anyone

19:19.283 --> 19:21.195
that we're only ever
one bad day away

19:21.285 --> 19:23.527
from them starting to see us
as the enemy again.

19:23.621 --> 19:25.863
So, what?
We wear matching costumes

19:25.956 --> 19:27.434
and smile in pictures
to make everyone feel safe?

19:27.458 --> 19:29.186
That is a small price to pay
for keeping the peace.

19:29.210 --> 19:32.453
- By risking our people to save theirs?
- Yes! Yes!

19:37.093 --> 19:38.379
It's funny.

19:38.469 --> 19:40.552
I can't actually remember the last time

19:40.638 --> 19:42.095
you were the one risking something.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.638
And by the way,

19:43.724 --> 19:46.137
the women are always saving
the men around here.

19:46.227 --> 19:48.640
You might wanna think about
changing the name to x-women.

19:50.856 --> 19:53.348
Hank: Your heartbeat's strong,
pulse is good,

19:53.442 --> 19:55.308
brain activity is normal.

19:56.654 --> 19:57.654
The genetic reading,

19:57.738 --> 19:59.855
I'm gonna take another look at.

20:02.743 --> 20:04.735
What can't be right?

20:05.871 --> 20:07.516
Did you just read my mind
without permission?

20:07.540 --> 20:11.659
Sorry, I didn't mean to,
but what can't be right?

20:13.796 --> 20:16.880
Whatever happened up there
made you stronger.

20:18.134 --> 20:19.736
You know, I've never seen
a power reading like this.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.049
You're-you're literally...
I mean, you're off the charts.

20:23.139 --> 20:25.381
So what does that mean?

20:25.474 --> 20:27.716
It means, um...

20:28.394 --> 20:31.307
We'll have to build a better machine.

20:31.397 --> 20:34.561
But... how do you feel?

20:35.693 --> 20:38.060
I feel good.

20:38.154 --> 20:39.395
Good.

20:39.488 --> 20:42.902
Well, as far as I can tell,
you're good to go.

20:42.992 --> 20:45.200
- You can head upstairs.
- All right.

20:47.496 --> 20:48.987
Thanks, Hank.

20:54.378 --> 20:55.744
Scott: Hank said that?

20:55.838 --> 20:57.454
- "Off the charts"?
- He did.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.505
The big blue furry guy?
The doctor? That Hank?

20:59.592 --> 21:01.083
Jean: That's the one. Why?

21:03.512 --> 21:05.504
You a little intimidated, maybe?

21:05.598 --> 21:07.590
Constantly.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.684
- Jean. Jean...
- Hmm?

21:13.564 --> 21:15.100
Are you...
Are you sure you're okay?

21:15.858 --> 21:19.693
I'm better than okay.
God, I feel great, I do.

21:20.529 --> 21:24.318
I don't know,
I feel like everything is just...

21:24.408 --> 21:26.149
Turned up.

21:27.077 --> 21:28.943
Yeah.

21:29.038 --> 21:32.156
- No, it's just...
- Just what?

21:35.044 --> 21:37.161
I thought I lost you today.

21:37.254 --> 21:38.745
I know.

21:40.424 --> 21:42.586
But I came back to you.

21:43.594 --> 21:45.802
I'll always come back to you.

22:18.045 --> 22:19.252
Is that Luna?

22:20.631 --> 22:22.213
Probably just squirrels.

22:23.926 --> 22:26.259
Mm...?

22:27.471 --> 22:29.508
I'm just gonna check on her.
I'll be right back.

22:29.598 --> 22:30.634
Just stay.

22:33.310 --> 22:35.768
- Tell her to shut up.
- Luna!

22:39.441 --> 22:40.648
Luna!

22:57.042 --> 22:58.042
Luna!

22:59.336 --> 23:00.668
Honey!

23:02.631 --> 23:04.839
What is it?
What is it, honey?

23:34.038 --> 23:36.280
He's got the dumbest laugh.

23:36.373 --> 23:37.659
That's not...

23:38.375 --> 23:39.536
That's not how it happened.

23:39.627 --> 23:42.085
- Oh, my god.
- That was...

23:47.134 --> 23:48.545
Man: Margaret?

23:51.931 --> 23:52.967
What...?

24:04.318 --> 24:07.026
Put your hands on me

24:09.156 --> 24:11.819
To marvel inside my heart

24:11.909 --> 24:15.402
make it come brighter

24:15.496 --> 24:18.785
our love is on fire

24:19.833 --> 24:22.200
turn all the lights out

24:22.294 --> 24:25.628
taking me higher

24:25.714 --> 24:28.673
put your hands on,
put your hands on me

24:30.094 --> 24:31.710
- Girl: This way.
- Boy: Okay.

24:33.389 --> 24:34.470
Jean: One more?

24:34.556 --> 24:36.388
Yeah, I'll go ahead
and finish this one.

24:40.270 --> 24:41.556
Two more?

24:43.148 --> 24:44.434
Uh, yeah.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.401
Put your hands on me

24:49.488 --> 24:51.650
- hey.
- Scott: Rocks.

24:53.367 --> 24:54.699
Thanks.

24:55.452 --> 24:57.739
- How is she doing?
- She's, uh...

24:59.289 --> 25:01.906
- Thirsty.
- Yeah, I see that.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.833
Does she seem okay to you?

25:03.919 --> 25:06.832
For someone who's just been
hit with solar flares...

25:06.922 --> 25:10.290
- I'd say she's doing pretty good.
- Thanks.

25:14.888 --> 25:16.128
You know, it wasn't so long ago

25:16.181 --> 25:18.047
we were throwing parties like this.

25:18.142 --> 25:20.680
Now we're the only ones left.

25:20.769 --> 25:24.388
Yeah. Last of the first class.

25:24.481 --> 25:26.643
I've been thinking.

25:26.734 --> 25:31.024
Maybe it's time for us to...
Move on.

25:31.113 --> 25:33.196
What do you...
Move on where?

25:33.282 --> 25:36.525
I don't know.
It's just Charles.

25:36.618 --> 25:38.951
Whatever is going on between
you two, it will blow over.

25:39.038 --> 25:41.075
No, it won't.

25:41.165 --> 25:43.452
I love him, but he's different.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.959
Everything is...
It's different now.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.628
Yeah.

25:48.714 --> 25:51.297
We changed the world
so we could live in it.

25:51.383 --> 25:53.500
Yeah, but maybe
that's what we should go do.

25:53.594 --> 25:56.052
Yeah, but this is our life.
This is what we wanted.

25:56.138 --> 25:58.050
- Not like this.
- Raven...

25:58.140 --> 26:02.134
It's not our life, Hank.
It's his.

26:02.227 --> 26:05.811
What do you think the "x"
in X-Men stands for?

26:05.898 --> 26:08.686
Charles and his X-Men
are where we turn

26:08.776 --> 26:11.143
when facing our worst fears.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.237
Thank you, Mr. President.

26:17.201 --> 26:18.612
Thank you.

26:21.371 --> 26:23.579
All I've really done
is create a world

26:23.665 --> 26:27.625
in which children
can find peace and pride

26:27.711 --> 26:29.794
in being different.

26:29.880 --> 26:33.965
Now, I know that some of you
choose to call us "superheroes."

26:34.051 --> 26:36.964
I must confess, I don't really
know what that word means,

26:37.054 --> 26:39.282
but it is a damn sight better
than what you used to call us.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.977
- Come dance with me.
- You wanna dance?

26:47.064 --> 26:48.521
Come on, Scott.

26:49.274 --> 26:52.358
Did... did you hear
what the kids are calling you?

26:52.444 --> 26:54.606
- Do I wanna know?
- Yeah.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.187
Phoenix.

26:56.281 --> 26:59.399
It's cool, right? You know,
a bird that rises from the dead.

26:59.493 --> 27:00.734
Whoa!

27:03.205 --> 27:04.412
Uh...

27:04.498 --> 27:06.218
You okay? Hey, maybe
we should take a break.

27:07.084 --> 27:08.370
- Jean.
- Jean: Stop.

27:13.757 --> 27:15.197
Jean: Wait, wait, wait.

27:15.467 --> 27:17.254
No, stop, stop, stop, stop.

27:20.806 --> 27:21.922
Raven: It's Jean.

27:26.395 --> 27:28.195
Scott: Jean. Jean, please.

27:29.398 --> 27:31.014
Stop, stop, stop.

27:31.108 --> 27:32.644
Stop, stop, stop!

27:40.993 --> 27:42.359
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Charles.

27:47.249 --> 27:49.394
I'm terribly sorry, everyone,
but I'm going to have to leave.

27:49.418 --> 27:51.501
Thank you very, very much.

28:31.460 --> 28:32.746
What is it?
What do you see?

28:32.836 --> 28:34.293
Nothing.

28:34.379 --> 28:37.213
Her mutation has grown
too powerful.

28:37.299 --> 28:39.666
For the first time,
I can't penetrate her mind.

28:39.760 --> 28:41.592
Raven: So that's what
we're doing down here?

28:41.678 --> 28:44.261
Hank built cerebro
to amplify my power.

28:44.348 --> 28:47.682
I think that's the only way I'm going
to get inside her head now.

29:07.621 --> 29:09.578
Hank, could you turn it up, please?

29:11.625 --> 29:14.368
A little more. Thank you.

29:17.130 --> 29:18.712
There she is.

29:28.267 --> 29:29.911
- Elaine: Yes, it is.
- John: Isn't that yummy?

29:29.935 --> 29:32.894
Is it supposed
to look like this?

29:32.980 --> 29:36.189
The mind of a psychic
is a fragile thing.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.062
It takes only the slightest tap

29:38.151 --> 29:39.938
to tip it in the wrong direction.

29:40.028 --> 29:43.487
I had to make adjustments
to her mind when she was young.

29:45.033 --> 29:47.195
What kind of adjustments?

29:47.286 --> 29:48.777
Scaffolding.

29:48.870 --> 29:52.705
Walls, rather,
to keep out all the trauma.

29:53.333 --> 29:55.450
What did you do to her, Charles?

29:56.420 --> 29:57.956
I saved her.

30:00.507 --> 30:05.047
Charles: I think that whatever happened
in space did something to her.

30:05.137 --> 30:07.299
In the process,
those walls that I erected

30:07.389 --> 30:09.426
are being torn down.

30:12.519 --> 30:13.851
Young Jean: Quiet!

30:15.856 --> 30:17.267
What is that?

30:17.357 --> 30:20.850
That... is what I was
trying to save her from.

30:21.903 --> 30:25.317
John: Table for one.
My usual.

30:26.074 --> 30:27.155
What is that voice?

30:28.577 --> 30:30.318
- No...
- Raven: Charles?

30:32.622 --> 30:34.079
Raven: Charles?

30:37.836 --> 30:39.077
She's waking up.

30:43.467 --> 30:44.674
Charles: Jean?

30:44.760 --> 30:47.298
Jean, don't be afraid.
It's only me.

30:48.347 --> 30:49.554
I want you to remain calm,

30:49.639 --> 30:52.757
and I'd like you to focus
on my voice.

30:54.519 --> 30:55.805
Get out of my head.

30:56.980 --> 31:01.065
Just stay calm, Jean.

31:02.319 --> 31:04.527
She's fighting me.
I need you to turn it up.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.365
I heard my father.

31:11.328 --> 31:14.071
- He's alive.
- You're just hearing things.

31:14.164 --> 31:16.076
Jean, your mind, it needs rest.

31:17.125 --> 31:18.457
You're...

31:18.543 --> 31:20.375
You're lying to me.

31:21.922 --> 31:23.288
I can sense it.

31:25.384 --> 31:26.670
Turn it up.

31:26.760 --> 31:29.423
- No, it's too much already.
- Don't do it, Hank.

31:29.513 --> 31:30.823
- Hank.
- Hank: No, I won't do it.

31:32.724 --> 31:34.181
For god's sake, Charles!

31:35.769 --> 31:37.556
Get out of my head!

31:37.646 --> 31:38.932
Charles!

31:39.022 --> 31:40.308
- Charles!
- Hank: Charles!

31:43.276 --> 31:44.892
Jean! Are you...

31:44.986 --> 31:47.023
Are you okay?

31:47.114 --> 31:49.322
What happened?
We were outside, and then...

31:49.408 --> 31:51.491
You had an accident.
You blacked out.

31:54.496 --> 31:56.863
Did I...
Did I do... do that?

31:57.582 --> 31:58.914
It's fine.

32:00.460 --> 32:03.168
- No, it's not fine.
- It was an accident.

32:03.255 --> 32:05.095
I don't know
what's happening to me.

32:05.132 --> 32:07.419
I can't control it.
I can't stay here, Scott.

32:07.509 --> 32:08.590
I really, I need to go.

32:08.677 --> 32:09.779
What are you talking about?
Where are you going?

32:09.803 --> 32:11.920
I need to see...
I need to see my father.

32:14.349 --> 32:17.683
- Your fa... your father's...
- He's alive. I can hear him.

32:17.769 --> 32:19.431
He died in the crash, remember?

32:19.521 --> 32:21.262
I'm sorry, Scott.
I need to go.

32:21.356 --> 32:23.042
- Hang on, hang on, hang on.
- God, please let me go.

32:23.066 --> 32:24.432
- Please.
- Slow down, please.

32:24.526 --> 32:27.735
I can't control it when it comes.
I can't stop it.

32:27.821 --> 32:29.608
Okay? I could hurt you again.

32:29.698 --> 32:31.610
I'll take that chance.

32:36.413 --> 32:37.529
I know.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.077
I know.

32:41.918 --> 32:43.625
But I won't.

32:54.264 --> 32:56.159
- Raven: Is he gonna be all right?
- Charles: I'm gonna be fine.

32:56.183 --> 32:58.077
- Hank: No, he's not fine.
- I'm going to be fine.

32:58.101 --> 32:59.433
What did you see?

33:02.314 --> 33:04.647
She's all desire.

33:05.358 --> 33:08.522
All rage, all pain.

33:10.989 --> 33:13.197
And it's all coming out at once.

33:14.784 --> 33:16.366
Something's happening to her, raven.

33:16.453 --> 33:18.410
She's changing.

33:19.456 --> 33:20.697
Into what?

33:22.334 --> 33:23.450
I don't know.

33:25.754 --> 33:27.086
Jean's gone. She left.

33:27.172 --> 33:29.004
- Gone where?
- I don't know.

33:29.090 --> 33:30.651
Charles,
you can track her with your mind.

33:30.675 --> 33:32.917
Not anymore.

33:33.011 --> 33:34.673
She's grown too powerful,
even for me.

33:34.763 --> 33:36.675
She said,
she was going to see her father.

33:37.807 --> 33:39.799
That doesn't make any sense, right?

33:41.102 --> 33:43.765
Prepare the jet.
We're going to bring her home.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.097
"We"?
Charles, you're in no condition.

33:46.191 --> 33:48.774
I have to stop this.
She's going to find...

33:49.903 --> 33:52.020
She's going to find
nothing good there.

34:05.252 --> 34:09.622
So this is all that's left
of the d'Bari empire?

34:13.677 --> 34:14.677
Greetings, vuk.

34:16.137 --> 34:18.003
Have you learned their language?

34:18.139 --> 34:19.425
Vuk: With ease.

34:19.516 --> 34:21.303
What have you learned?

34:21.393 --> 34:25.103
The power is being contained
inside one of them.

34:27.065 --> 34:29.933
- This primitive species?
- She's stronger.

34:30.819 --> 34:32.185
A mutant.

34:33.113 --> 34:34.695
She has no idea
what's happening to her.

34:35.991 --> 34:37.983
I can use that.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.113
If we can control that power...

34:40.954 --> 34:42.786
We can resurrect our race.

34:42.872 --> 34:44.408
Begin again.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.121
Here.

34:51.006 --> 34:52.372
Where is she?

35:26.124 --> 35:27.911
John: Can I help you?

35:30.128 --> 35:31.209
Dad?

35:43.558 --> 35:45.675
Jean.

35:52.942 --> 35:55.104
Raven: How do you know
where we're going, Charles?

35:56.237 --> 35:58.090
If you can't track her,
how do you know where she is?

35:58.114 --> 35:59.855
You know how.

36:01.201 --> 36:02.692
Raven: Jesus Christ.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.404
What did you do?

36:07.582 --> 36:09.369
I protected her.

36:11.378 --> 36:13.370
From the truth.

36:17.133 --> 36:19.341
There's another word for that.

36:22.806 --> 36:24.547
He told me you were dead.

36:25.767 --> 36:28.305
I never thought
I'd be back here.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.556
It's the same.

36:33.483 --> 36:34.724
All of it.

36:39.406 --> 36:43.491
Can I get you something
to drink or-or eat?

36:44.536 --> 36:45.617
Uh...

36:45.704 --> 36:47.445
No, I'm good. I'm...

36:48.289 --> 36:49.825
I'm really good.

36:54.254 --> 36:56.246
It's so good to see you.

37:00.635 --> 37:03.298
Um, I'll get you some water, okay?

37:47.932 --> 37:49.594
Young Jean: Quiet.

37:53.188 --> 37:54.429
John: Jean?

38:04.115 --> 38:06.448
All these photos, none of me.

38:11.456 --> 38:13.288
You never looked for me.

38:13.374 --> 38:15.661
- John: Jean...
- Why didn't you look for me?

38:15.752 --> 38:17.618
Maybe we should sit down.

38:17.712 --> 38:19.248
No, I don't wanna sit down.

38:19.339 --> 38:21.581
Why didn't you come
looking for me?

38:22.509 --> 38:24.842
And don't try to lie.
I can read your mind.

38:26.095 --> 38:28.212
John: I can't handle her.

38:28.306 --> 38:31.390
I don't even know what she is.

38:31.476 --> 38:33.058
I do.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.685
Then you'll take her?

38:37.690 --> 38:40.228
You didn't even say goodbye.

38:40.318 --> 38:43.106
I didn't get a chance
to say goodbye to your mother.

38:43.196 --> 38:44.876
I was eight years old.

38:44.906 --> 38:47.364
How could you do that to me?

38:47.450 --> 38:49.487
You wanna come in?

38:52.205 --> 38:54.117
Come all the way in.

38:54.207 --> 38:56.699
Don't forget what you did.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.588
Young Jean: I don't know.
It's not me.

39:07.011 --> 39:09.173
Quiet!

39:13.059 --> 39:15.847
No. No.

39:25.405 --> 39:27.317
John: I'm sorry, Jean...

39:28.074 --> 39:30.236
But my whole world died that day.

39:32.537 --> 39:35.746
And... you went with it.

39:40.128 --> 39:43.667
Jean, don't, please.

39:43.756 --> 39:44.963
Stop that.

39:45.049 --> 39:46.085
Stop it.

39:46.175 --> 39:48.167
It's not me. It's them.

40:12.160 --> 40:14.243
You shouldn't have come here.

40:15.288 --> 40:17.224
Why is that? We've only come
to bring you home, Jean.

40:17.248 --> 40:20.207
I don't have a home.
You made sure of that.

40:20.293 --> 40:22.706
Look, your father couldn't handle you,

40:22.795 --> 40:24.331
and we took you in.

40:24.422 --> 40:26.755
You told me my father was dead,

40:26.841 --> 40:28.377
and you used me for my powers.

40:28.468 --> 40:31.506
No, that's just not true.
That's not what happened.

40:31.596 --> 40:33.258
Jean, we can help you.

40:33.348 --> 40:35.385
I can help you,
but you have to listen to me.

40:35.475 --> 40:37.091
No. No, I don't.

40:37.185 --> 40:38.676
Scott.

40:41.564 --> 40:43.851
He lied to me, Scott.
About everything.

40:43.942 --> 40:46.262
We'll figure everything out together.
Just come back to me.

40:46.319 --> 40:48.199
Remember, you said
you'd always come back to me.

40:50.406 --> 40:52.238
Come back to me.

40:57.914 --> 40:58.914
Jean.

41:02.001 --> 41:04.835
Stay away from me.
Stay away from me.

41:04.921 --> 41:06.128
Stay away from me!

41:08.633 --> 41:11.376
- Charles: Stop her quickly!
- Charles, wait, wait!

41:23.231 --> 41:24.231
Jean, please!

42:02.395 --> 42:04.011
Jean, stop!

42:04.105 --> 42:06.688
- I've got the shot. I'm taking...
- No, you're not.

42:06.774 --> 42:09.312
I'm sorry, Hank.
I want raven to have a chance.

42:14.574 --> 42:16.406
I told you to stay away.

42:16.492 --> 42:18.154
That's never gonna happen.

42:21.080 --> 42:22.912
Please. Stop.

42:22.999 --> 42:24.865
Not until I know
you're gonna be okay.

42:24.959 --> 42:27.997
Something's happening to me.

42:28.129 --> 42:30.337
So come home.

42:30.423 --> 42:32.130
Let me take care of you.

42:32.216 --> 42:33.798
Jean: No, you can't.

42:33.885 --> 42:35.672
You can't. You don't...

42:38.347 --> 42:41.090
You don't know what it's like.

42:42.143 --> 42:43.350
Then tell me.

42:44.270 --> 42:46.057
When it comes...

42:48.566 --> 42:50.478
People get hurt.

42:52.070 --> 42:53.732
I'm not afraid of you, Jean.

42:53.821 --> 42:54.821
Look at me.

42:54.864 --> 42:56.821
Focus on my voice.

42:56.908 --> 42:58.945
We're going to get
through this together.

42:59.035 --> 43:00.901
I'm not giving up on you, Jean.

43:00.995 --> 43:03.703
This is what family does.
We take care of each other.

43:04.499 --> 43:05.990
You're my family, Jean.

43:06.084 --> 43:07.620
No matter what.

43:07.710 --> 43:08.710
Stop!

43:50.920 --> 43:55.085
- Raven...
- I can't catch my breath.

43:57.093 --> 43:59.085
No.

44:00.471 --> 44:01.803
I love you.

44:01.889 --> 44:03.881
What?

44:07.979 --> 44:09.971
I...

44:15.194 --> 44:16.776
Raven, please.

44:21.284 --> 44:22.525
Raven.

44:24.078 --> 44:26.365
Raven. I love you, raven.

44:28.833 --> 44:29.949
No.

44:32.712 --> 44:33.793
No.

45:00.573 --> 45:02.940
Charles: We are all at war,

45:03.034 --> 45:04.696
at war with ourselves,

45:06.162 --> 45:09.496
and raven had been waging
that war for most of her life.

45:10.499 --> 45:12.365
I hope now she's found peace.

45:15.004 --> 45:17.496
Raven died doing
what she did best...

45:18.341 --> 45:20.424
Helping a friend,

45:20.509 --> 45:22.216
a friend in need.

45:25.139 --> 45:26.675
She is not gone.

45:28.226 --> 45:30.718
She lives on, through me,

45:31.437 --> 45:32.973
through us...

45:33.731 --> 45:36.144
And through the spirit of the X-Men.

45:46.077 --> 45:47.318
Mutant student: Is it true?

45:47.411 --> 45:49.198
Jean killed her?

45:58.631 --> 46:00.623
Scott: She didn't know
what she was doing.

46:01.550 --> 46:03.462
Jean lost control.

46:04.470 --> 46:06.678
But she-she's still Jean.

46:07.473 --> 46:09.510
She's still our friend.

46:09.600 --> 46:12.092
We can still help her.
We can find her.

46:13.104 --> 46:14.936
And bring her home.

46:17.900 --> 46:20.984
That's...
That's what we're gonna do, okay?

46:32.456 --> 46:34.072
It wasn't an accident, Scott.

46:36.127 --> 46:37.663
She killed raven.

46:37.753 --> 46:40.211
Maybe you can't admit that
to yourself or to them,

46:40.923 --> 46:42.084
but it's the truth.

46:43.217 --> 46:45.834
That was not Jean,
not the Jean I know.

46:49.682 --> 46:51.969
Sometimes you want to believe

46:52.059 --> 46:54.051
people are something
that they are not.

46:55.730 --> 46:58.473
And then, by the time
you realize who they are...

46:59.692 --> 47:01.103
It's too late.

47:26.093 --> 47:30.383
Do you know, this is where
I first met raven.

47:35.186 --> 47:38.520
She was just
this little girl, and...

47:38.606 --> 47:41.394
She'd broken in,
looking for food.

47:42.318 --> 47:43.559
I said she could stay,

47:43.652 --> 47:46.861
and that she'd never have
to go hungry again.

47:46.947 --> 47:51.237
And then, I think
I promised her a better life.

47:52.328 --> 47:55.116
And then you took it from her.

47:55.206 --> 47:57.823
- I beg your pardon?
- You heard me.

47:57.917 --> 48:00.284
- Hank...
- This is your fault, Charles.

48:02.213 --> 48:03.920
It's your fault she's dead.

48:04.006 --> 48:06.794
- Come on, that's not fair.
- Fair? No, don't talk about fair.

48:06.884 --> 48:08.653
You messed with the mind
of an eight-year-old girl.

48:08.677 --> 48:10.155
You pushed down
all that pain and anger...

48:10.179 --> 48:11.490
- Jean?
- Where do you think it's gonna go?

48:11.514 --> 48:12.971
I did that to help her.
What I do,

48:13.057 --> 48:14.659
- I do to help all of them.
- Please, come on, please.

48:14.683 --> 48:17.972
- You still can't see what you did wrong?
- It's just...

48:18.062 --> 48:20.600
No, you need to face this, Charles!
You need to face it.

48:20.689 --> 48:22.369
Come on, admit it to me right now.
Come on!

48:22.400 --> 48:23.641
Admit it!

48:24.527 --> 48:27.019
Charles,
just admit you were wrong, please.

48:32.034 --> 48:33.866
You still can't.

48:36.664 --> 48:38.997
I really hope you feel better, Hank.

48:39.083 --> 48:42.747
I hope that railing on me five minutes
after I put my foster sister in the grave

48:42.837 --> 48:44.314
- has made you feel...
- This isn't about me.

48:44.338 --> 48:46.274
You, know what? I know what
I did wrong, okay, Charles?

48:46.298 --> 48:48.711
She was gonna leave.
Raven was gonna leave,

48:48.801 --> 48:51.214
and I talked her out of it.

48:53.556 --> 48:55.798
She saw what the rest of us didn't.

48:58.060 --> 48:59.060
And what was that?

48:59.145 --> 49:00.477
This whole time,
we've been trying

49:00.563 --> 49:02.043
to protect these kids from the world,

49:02.106 --> 49:04.473
when really, we should've been
protecting them from you.

49:11.031 --> 49:13.865
I don't know
what's happening to me.

49:17.413 --> 49:18.449
Why?

49:20.833 --> 49:22.950
Why did I do that?

49:51.572 --> 49:53.780
- No civilians past this...
- Jones: FBI.

50:00.956 --> 50:02.663
Give us the room.

50:12.218 --> 50:14.255
And who are you supposed to be?

50:17.014 --> 50:19.927
We're the ones who are
going to help you, Mr. Grey.

50:22.353 --> 50:24.766
I didn't know
she was gonna come back.

50:26.649 --> 50:28.436
I'm sorry for all this.

50:29.944 --> 50:31.435
It's okay.

50:37.076 --> 50:40.285
We just wanna get an accurate
picture of who Jean is.

50:40.371 --> 50:42.658
Tell us about when you
gave her to the mutant.

50:47.086 --> 50:48.122
Um...

50:50.297 --> 50:51.583
Maybe, uh...

50:53.259 --> 50:56.627
It might be better
if I talk to a lawyer.

51:00.558 --> 51:02.595
I'm so sorry, Mr. Grey,

51:02.685 --> 51:05.143
but I need to know
everything about her now.

51:08.065 --> 51:10.933
This truly is
an unfortunate development.

51:11.026 --> 51:12.312
Why-why is that?

51:13.028 --> 51:16.066
Because it's so much easier
to understand your language

51:16.156 --> 51:17.738
when you're not screaming.

52:05.831 --> 52:07.242
Man: Who are you?

52:08.626 --> 52:10.663
What are you doing here?

52:14.256 --> 52:16.339
Answer the question.

52:27.811 --> 52:29.393
Leave her.

52:31.523 --> 52:32.639
Why are you here?

52:42.951 --> 52:44.408
Are you hurt?

52:45.371 --> 52:46.371
No.

52:47.831 --> 52:49.697
You'll have to forgive them.

52:49.792 --> 52:52.375
They're not accustomed
to uninvited guests.

52:54.338 --> 52:55.374
Please.

53:06.141 --> 53:07.598
Why don't you start
at the beginning?

53:11.730 --> 53:13.346
Whose blood is that?

53:16.068 --> 53:18.105
- What?
- On your shirt.

53:18.195 --> 53:19.231
Whose blood is it?

53:21.073 --> 53:23.690
Look, I'm not Charles.

53:25.119 --> 53:26.781
I can't read your mind.

53:33.001 --> 53:34.617
You hurt people.

53:36.296 --> 53:38.037
- It's been a while.
- But you did.

53:39.299 --> 53:42.258
Yes. What did you
come here to ask me?

53:42.344 --> 53:44.882
How did you stop?

53:51.937 --> 53:54.270
I've lived with vengeance
my whole life.

53:55.774 --> 53:58.141
Ever since I was a child, I...

53:58.819 --> 54:01.732
Lost everyone I ever loved, so...

54:02.531 --> 54:04.113
I hurt people.

54:04.199 --> 54:06.236
Yes, killed people.

54:08.412 --> 54:11.120
Killed whatever I thought
would make the pain go away.

54:14.084 --> 54:15.245
It didn't,

54:15.335 --> 54:17.577
no matter how many souls
I sent under...

54:20.591 --> 54:22.298
So I stopped.

54:23.302 --> 54:25.259
I don't know how to stop.

54:28.223 --> 54:30.180
I don't know
what's happening to me.

54:36.940 --> 54:39.023
When I lose control...

54:41.695 --> 54:44.153
Things happen, bad things...

54:46.950 --> 54:48.612
To people I love.

54:55.542 --> 54:56.874
Whose blood is that?

54:59.046 --> 55:01.083
Isn't that why you came here?

55:01.173 --> 55:03.290
- What do you think I can do for you?
- I don't know!

55:03.383 --> 55:05.500
Yes, you do.
Whose blood is that?

55:05.594 --> 55:07.363
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- Did you hurt someone?

55:07.387 --> 55:09.032
- Please, I...
- Answer the question, Jean.

55:09.056 --> 55:10.888
- Stop, Erik, you're making me angry.
- Good!

55:10.974 --> 55:12.465
I want you to be angry.

55:12.559 --> 55:14.496
- Show me what happens, Jean.
- I don't wanna hurt you!

55:14.520 --> 55:15.997
What happens when you're angry?
Show me.

55:16.021 --> 55:17.603
- Show me what...
- Stop!

55:18.690 --> 55:20.352
We've got military.

55:20.442 --> 55:21.649
Inbound.

55:22.820 --> 55:24.061
Stay here.

55:30.994 --> 55:32.781
Two birds. Us.

55:32.871 --> 55:35.204
Tell everyone to stay calm,
but ready.

56:05.779 --> 56:07.299
Captain: All right, that's far enough.

56:16.248 --> 56:18.205
We have a legal right to be here.

56:19.710 --> 56:21.702
This land was given to us
by the us government.

56:21.795 --> 56:23.707
We have no intention of taking it back.

56:24.590 --> 56:25.956
We're not here for you.

56:26.049 --> 56:28.541
We're looking for one of the X-Men.
Jean grey.

56:28.635 --> 56:30.752
Erik: I haven't seen her
in a long time.

56:30.846 --> 56:32.574
Captain: Then you won't mind
if we look around.

56:32.598 --> 56:35.306
Jean: I don't have a home.
You made sure of that.

56:35.392 --> 56:36.578
Erik: Would you mind
if I came to your home...

56:36.602 --> 56:37.704
Raven: This is what family does.

56:37.728 --> 56:40.015
Erik: Unannounced and uninvited?

56:40.105 --> 56:41.471
Raven: You're my family, Jean.

56:42.357 --> 56:43.723
Look...

56:43.817 --> 56:45.433
I know who you are.

56:46.361 --> 56:48.603
- I don't wanna fight.
- No, you don't.

56:49.239 --> 56:50.775
Then step aside.

56:51.450 --> 56:54.534
We have the same rights
as you and your family.

56:54.620 --> 56:57.454
And like I said,
we're not here for you.

56:58.749 --> 57:00.991
We're here for a girl
who gave up those rights

57:01.084 --> 57:03.701
when she attacked
a squad of police officers.

57:04.630 --> 57:06.496
They have families, too.

57:07.716 --> 57:09.924
Guess you didn't hear
about that.

57:11.678 --> 57:14.170
We don't get the news out here, captain.

57:20.395 --> 57:21.931
Stop that.

57:22.022 --> 57:23.763
I said stop that right now!

57:23.857 --> 57:26.474
- It's not me.
- Jean: It's me.

57:28.403 --> 57:29.443
Erik: Jean?

57:32.532 --> 57:33.532
Jean!

57:35.953 --> 57:37.160
Erik: Get down!

58:19.746 --> 58:21.954
Get in the chopper and go!

58:22.582 --> 58:24.164
I can't hold it!

58:25.168 --> 58:26.875
Fall back! Fall back!

58:27.421 --> 58:28.621
Soldier: Let's go, move, move!

58:29.923 --> 58:32.666
Let's go!
Hook in! Move it! Come on!

58:33.927 --> 58:35.567
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Come on!

58:36.263 --> 58:37.573
Captain: Give me your hand.
Help me!

58:54.656 --> 58:55.656
Erik: Go!

58:58.076 --> 59:00.068
- Leave this place!
- I need your help.

59:00.162 --> 59:01.994
I thought
you protected mutants here.

59:02.080 --> 59:05.164
I am protecting them...
From you.

59:06.877 --> 59:08.368
You need to leave.

59:09.254 --> 59:10.415
Go!

59:27.731 --> 59:30.293
Newsman: Word coming late
tonight that congress is considering

59:30.317 --> 59:32.479
temporary mutant internment facilities

59:32.569 --> 59:34.561
for those whose powers
have been deemed

59:34.654 --> 59:37.146
a clear and present danger
to human citizens.

59:37.240 --> 59:40.153
This coming on the heels
of the Jean grey incidents

59:40.243 --> 59:42.405
which, after destroying
two communities,

59:42.496 --> 59:44.829
and attacking police
and military personnel...

1:00:00.138 --> 1:00:01.299
This is Charles Xavier.

1:00:01.389 --> 1:00:03.631
I'd like to talk
to the president.

1:00:03.725 --> 1:00:06.889
Man: Mr. Xavier, this phone
will no longer be operational.

1:00:08.021 --> 1:00:10.729
I have to tell him not to do this.

1:00:10.816 --> 1:00:13.650
There's no need to throw away
everything that we've accomplished.

1:00:13.735 --> 1:00:16.318
You have to give us a chance and...

1:00:26.289 --> 1:00:28.451
Charles: If you break something, anything,

1:00:28.542 --> 1:00:29.828
I can fix it.

1:00:29.918 --> 1:00:31.454
Not anything.

1:00:34.840 --> 1:00:37.674
Newsman: An international
search is underway for grey.

1:00:37.759 --> 1:00:40.502
Authorities are urging citizens
to keep their distance.

1:00:40.595 --> 1:00:42.052
Any sighting should be reported

1:00:42.139 --> 1:00:43.630
to the police immediately.

1:00:43.723 --> 1:00:45.180
Government officials have...

1:00:45.267 --> 1:00:46.758
This man was electrocuted...

1:00:46.852 --> 1:00:49.265
Is that all you got?

1:00:51.439 --> 1:00:52.896
Give me another.

1:01:15.213 --> 1:01:16.499
Hello, Jean.

1:01:23.889 --> 1:01:26.632
You can't control
my mind like theirs.

1:01:27.642 --> 1:01:29.099
I'm not like them.

1:01:30.187 --> 1:01:31.553
Same, please.

1:01:34.232 --> 1:01:35.973
How did you find me?

1:01:37.277 --> 1:01:40.065
Let's just say I have friends
in high places.

1:01:42.157 --> 1:01:43.238
Who are you?

1:01:44.159 --> 1:01:46.526
The better question is...

1:01:46.620 --> 1:01:47.861
Who are you?

1:01:47.954 --> 1:01:49.365
Are you a scared little girl

1:01:49.456 --> 1:01:51.368
who answers
to a man in a chair...

1:01:52.709 --> 1:01:55.417
Or are you the most powerful
creature on the planet?

1:01:59.216 --> 1:02:01.082
I don't know who I am.

1:02:01.176 --> 1:02:02.542
Yes, you do.

1:02:03.887 --> 1:02:06.095
You're the girl
who everyone abandons.

1:02:10.644 --> 1:02:12.556
Maybe they had good reason.

1:02:13.480 --> 1:02:15.312
Because of what's inside you?

1:02:16.650 --> 1:02:21.896
You're afraid of it because you think
it makes you bad, evil,

1:02:21.988 --> 1:02:25.231
all the words you've been taught
to keep you in line.

1:02:26.326 --> 1:02:28.693
Words created
a very long time ago

1:02:28.787 --> 1:02:30.870
by men with very little minds.

1:02:30.956 --> 1:02:34.199
They can't begin to comprehend
what you are.

1:02:34.292 --> 1:02:36.124
Even your X-Men.

1:02:37.128 --> 1:02:38.869
And you can?

1:02:41.091 --> 1:02:42.091
Charles?

1:02:44.344 --> 1:02:46.586
Charles? Charles!

1:02:46.680 --> 1:02:49.468
- Hey, Hank's not in class.
- What?

1:02:49.557 --> 1:02:50.843
Hank's not in class.

1:02:52.477 --> 1:02:53.763
Did you check his quarters?

1:02:53.853 --> 1:02:56.140
Yeah, he's not there either.

1:03:11.705 --> 1:03:13.162
Erik: Where are the rest of them?

1:03:13.832 --> 1:03:14.868
Hank: No, I'm alone.

1:03:16.001 --> 1:03:17.708
What, no Charles?

1:03:21.965 --> 1:03:23.126
If you're looking for Jean...

1:03:24.217 --> 1:03:26.675
- She's gone.
- No, I know that.

1:03:26.761 --> 1:03:28.548
Then why are you here, Hank?

1:03:29.514 --> 1:03:31.050
You have eyes and ears
around the world

1:03:31.141 --> 1:03:33.133
to help you find mutants
for this place.

1:03:34.227 --> 1:03:36.093
I want you to help me find Jean.

1:03:36.187 --> 1:03:38.395
I've no reason to find her.

1:03:38.481 --> 1:03:40.313
Not for me.

1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:41.936
Do it for raven.

1:03:43.111 --> 1:03:44.318
Did she send you?

1:03:46.906 --> 1:03:48.363
You don't know?

1:03:51.786 --> 1:03:53.277
Know what, Hank?

1:03:54.456 --> 1:03:55.822
Raven's dead.

1:03:58.126 --> 1:03:59.492
Jean killed her.

1:04:21.024 --> 1:04:23.311
I need you to help me find Jean.

1:04:29.449 --> 1:04:31.736
If I find her, I'll kill her.

1:04:33.203 --> 1:04:34.910
I know.

1:04:51.971 --> 1:04:53.678
Jean: They know who I am?

1:04:53.765 --> 1:04:54.801
Yes.

1:04:56.309 --> 1:04:58.096
And they're not afraid of me?

1:05:00.313 --> 1:05:03.397
The only person here
afraid of your power...

1:05:04.067 --> 1:05:05.558
Is you.

1:05:19.332 --> 1:05:25.920
Go, gather the others. If she can't
control it, then we will destroy it.

1:05:31.428 --> 1:05:34.387
This is what
you wanted to show me?

1:05:34.472 --> 1:05:35.804
No.

1:05:36.516 --> 1:05:39.008
This is what I want to show you.

1:05:57.078 --> 1:05:59.741
What entered you in space
was not a solar flare.

1:06:00.790 --> 1:06:02.531
And it was not an accident.

1:06:03.334 --> 1:06:05.041
It was drawn to you.

1:06:06.754 --> 1:06:08.495
What-what was it?

1:06:08.590 --> 1:06:11.958
Vuk: A pure and unimaginably
powerful cosmic force.

1:06:13.011 --> 1:06:15.048
We saw it enter you in space.

1:06:15.930 --> 1:06:19.674
We were there, Jean,
following that force.

1:06:20.685 --> 1:06:22.176
Why?

1:06:22.270 --> 1:06:25.479
Because it's the spark that
gave life to the universe...

1:06:25.565 --> 1:06:28.854
And the flame that
consumed my world.

1:06:33.323 --> 1:06:35.736
What remains of my people
searched the stars

1:06:35.825 --> 1:06:37.691
for that power, to control it,

1:06:37.785 --> 1:06:41.745
but it destroyed everything
it ever came into contact with.

1:06:41.831 --> 1:06:43.322
Until you.

1:06:45.210 --> 1:06:46.951
Why me?

1:06:47.670 --> 1:06:49.878
Because you're stronger
than you know.

1:06:51.216 --> 1:06:53.378
Because you're special, Jean.

1:06:58.556 --> 1:07:02.596
With my help, you could
control what's inside you.

1:07:03.269 --> 1:07:07.354
Harness that power
to create whole new worlds...

1:07:08.233 --> 1:07:10.441
Turn dust into water...

1:07:11.402 --> 1:07:13.359
Water into life.

1:07:14.739 --> 1:07:18.198
It's your destiny, Jean,
to become something greater...

1:07:19.077 --> 1:07:23.913
To evolve into the greatest force
in the galaxy.

1:07:37.554 --> 1:07:40.171
I told you they could
never understand you.

1:07:42.016 --> 1:07:44.224
And what they don't
understand, they fear.

1:07:44.310 --> 1:07:46.267
And what they fear...

1:07:46.354 --> 1:07:48.721
They seek to destroy.

1:07:53.486 --> 1:07:55.022
Erik: Did raven suffer?

1:07:56.906 --> 1:07:58.238
Not for long.

1:08:01.703 --> 1:08:04.366
I know we've had our...

1:08:05.748 --> 1:08:08.240
Differences in the past, but...

1:08:08.334 --> 1:08:10.041
We both love raven.

1:08:11.921 --> 1:08:12.921
Yes.

1:08:16.134 --> 1:08:17.341
Yes, we did.

1:08:18.136 --> 1:08:20.423
There's been a sighting
of the girl.

1:08:20.513 --> 1:08:21.513
Erik: Where?

1:08:21.598 --> 1:08:23.009
New York.

1:08:23.099 --> 1:08:25.091
We'll have eyes on the ground
when we get there.

1:09:18.738 --> 1:09:20.320
It's time.

1:09:26.746 --> 1:09:28.112
Scott: We know where Jean is.

1:09:28.206 --> 1:09:29.642
I thought you said
you couldn't track her.

1:09:29.666 --> 1:09:31.658
It wasn't me who found her.

1:09:31.751 --> 1:09:33.162
It was Erik.

1:09:33.252 --> 1:09:34.663
Hank's with him.

1:09:34.754 --> 1:09:37.041
They're on their way to her,
and they're gonna kill her.

1:09:37.131 --> 1:09:39.418
And anyone
who stands in their way.

1:09:39.509 --> 1:09:42.422
Kurt, I'd like you to take
Scott and I there, but that's all.

1:09:42.512 --> 1:09:44.281
I want you to leave us there
and then come home.

1:09:44.305 --> 1:09:45.841
And me?

1:09:45.932 --> 1:09:48.015
I'm not talking
to you now as X-Men.

1:09:49.060 --> 1:09:51.427
Scott and I will go and fight
for Jean without you.

1:09:51.521 --> 1:09:52.807
End of discussion.

1:09:52.897 --> 1:09:56.607
Storm, I have lost
so many of the people I love.

1:09:57.527 --> 1:09:59.564
I'm not going to ask you to go.

1:09:59.654 --> 1:10:00.940
Scott: I am.

1:10:02.990 --> 1:10:04.401
We need you.

1:10:05.451 --> 1:10:07.033
I need you.

1:10:07.120 --> 1:10:08.452
- I've got your back.
- Look...

1:10:08.538 --> 1:10:10.404
End of discussion.

1:10:16.295 --> 1:10:18.787
Charles: Kurt, close your eyes.

1:10:19.382 --> 1:10:21.248
I'll show you our destination.

1:10:34.230 --> 1:10:35.391
Where are they?

1:10:52.248 --> 1:10:53.864
She's in there.

1:10:55.585 --> 1:10:56.951
Charles: Hello, old friend.

1:11:09.849 --> 1:11:12.216
Save the "old friend" shit,
Charles.

1:11:12.310 --> 1:11:13.721
And stay out of my way.

1:11:13.811 --> 1:11:15.643
I'm sorry for what she did.

1:11:16.773 --> 1:11:18.264
But I can't let you go in there.

1:11:18.357 --> 1:11:21.976
You're always sorry, Charles.
And there's always a speech.

1:11:23.696 --> 1:11:25.437
But nobody cares anymore.

1:11:26.365 --> 1:11:30.234
We do this here, now,
they'll see us as monsters.

1:11:30.328 --> 1:11:32.445
Violent freaks,
fighting on the streets of New York.

1:11:32.538 --> 1:11:33.538
What did I tell you?

1:11:33.623 --> 1:11:35.865
Charles: Damn it, man,
your homeland will be gone.

1:11:35.958 --> 1:11:37.915
Everything you care about.

1:11:38.002 --> 1:11:39.413
Save it.

1:11:39.504 --> 1:11:41.587
If you touch her,
I will fucking kill you.

1:11:41.672 --> 1:11:43.914
Don't do this, Erik.

1:11:44.717 --> 1:11:47.676
Killing Jean will not bring raven back.

1:11:49.388 --> 1:11:51.129
The girl dies.

1:12:28.177 --> 1:12:29.668
Kurt, I need you!

1:12:36.060 --> 1:12:37.767
Charles: Kurt, get me inside.

1:12:39.939 --> 1:12:41.851
You're not the only one
who can control minds.

1:12:41.941 --> 1:12:42.977
Kurt!

1:13:37.872 --> 1:13:40.660
They're coming to kill you.
You're not gonna let them.

1:13:40.750 --> 1:13:42.366
You're gonna fight back.

1:13:54.055 --> 1:13:56.012
Feel the power inside you.

1:13:56.098 --> 1:13:58.181
The power is you.

1:14:30.549 --> 1:14:31.665
Hold them!

1:14:45.606 --> 1:14:47.893
I know whose blood that was.

1:14:52.905 --> 1:14:54.441
You cast me out.

1:14:55.574 --> 1:14:57.236
Now you come here to kill me?

1:14:58.035 --> 1:14:59.947
That's right.

1:15:19.348 --> 1:15:20.964
And you couldn't even do that.

1:15:25.604 --> 1:15:28.221
Let me show you how.

1:16:06.437 --> 1:16:07.973
Charles: Scott, a little help?

1:16:12.026 --> 1:16:13.688
Kurt!

1:16:13.778 --> 1:16:15.144
Kurt! Kurt?

1:16:15.237 --> 1:16:17.354
- You all right?
- No!

1:16:17.448 --> 1:16:20.191
Come here!
Get me in that house now!

1:16:23.913 --> 1:16:25.575
Have you come to kill me, too?

1:16:25.664 --> 1:16:26.871
Never.

1:16:27.374 --> 1:16:28.490
Jean, never!

1:16:29.335 --> 1:16:31.452
I failed you.
I know that, but...

1:16:32.046 --> 1:16:33.833
This isn't you.

1:16:35.216 --> 1:16:36.832
Charles: Kurt!

1:16:38.511 --> 1:16:41.845
- Jean, please!
- You have no idea who I am.

1:16:41.931 --> 1:16:44.139
I've raised you
since you were a little girl.

1:16:44.225 --> 1:16:45.261
I think I do.

1:16:47.144 --> 1:16:49.682
She's not your little girl anymore.

1:16:50.314 --> 1:16:51.314
Who...

1:16:54.235 --> 1:16:55.476
What are you?

1:16:58.781 --> 1:17:01.774
Jean, please try and remember
what I taught you.

1:17:01.867 --> 1:17:03.028
You can control it.

1:17:03.119 --> 1:17:05.987
You can do anything
you set your mind to.

1:17:06.080 --> 1:17:07.616
So show me.

1:17:10.292 --> 1:17:11.658
Walk to me.

1:17:14.922 --> 1:17:15.922
You know I can't.

1:17:21.220 --> 1:17:22.220
No!

1:17:31.355 --> 1:17:32.641
Please, Jean.

1:17:41.657 --> 1:17:42.773
Please.

1:17:57.715 --> 1:18:01.709
I can't see in your mind anymore...

1:18:02.761 --> 1:18:05.003
But you can see in mine.

1:18:07.183 --> 1:18:08.469
So look.

1:18:10.144 --> 1:18:11.635
Jean, look.

1:18:15.065 --> 1:18:16.793
Charles: And what you
choose to do with your gift,

1:18:16.817 --> 1:18:19.355
well, that's entirely up to you.

1:18:20.863 --> 1:18:22.525
This could be your new home.

1:18:23.574 --> 1:18:25.691
We could be your new family.

1:18:27.244 --> 1:18:28.244
No!

1:18:29.955 --> 1:18:32.993
Because you are not broken.

1:18:41.634 --> 1:18:43.341
Then you'll take her?

1:18:43.427 --> 1:18:45.009
Yes.

1:18:47.181 --> 1:18:48.181
No!

1:18:50.684 --> 1:18:53.802
I can help her in ways
that you can't.

1:18:54.355 --> 1:18:56.142
She can't be helped.

1:18:56.899 --> 1:18:58.390
She's a lost cause.

1:19:02.279 --> 1:19:03.736
Charles: No, she's not.

1:19:03.822 --> 1:19:06.155
As long as there's someone
to care for her, who believes,

1:19:06.242 --> 1:19:07.323
then there's still hope.

1:19:11.872 --> 1:19:13.864
Then there...

1:19:13.958 --> 1:19:15.699
There's still hope.

1:19:30.641 --> 1:19:33.429
I knew. I knew
you were still in there.

1:19:36.146 --> 1:19:38.308
Vuk: He just showed you
your past.

1:19:41.568 --> 1:19:43.480
Follow me...

1:19:43.570 --> 1:19:45.687
Into your future.

1:19:47.741 --> 1:19:48.741
No.

1:19:55.040 --> 1:19:56.840
Guard: Set
weapons to neutralize.

1:19:57.293 --> 1:19:59.125
I never asked for this.

1:19:59.211 --> 1:20:00.702
Any of it.

1:20:01.755 --> 1:20:05.544
I traveled to the stars
for a gift that you don't want.

1:20:08.345 --> 1:20:09.677
Then take it.

1:20:12.391 --> 1:20:13.472
Please.

1:20:13.559 --> 1:20:15.016
Free me.

1:20:18.314 --> 1:20:19.555
I'll try.

1:21:07.237 --> 1:21:08.694
Stop it.
You're going to kill her.

1:21:09.823 --> 1:21:12.406
Your lives mean nothing.

1:21:12.493 --> 1:21:16.703
Your world will be ours.

1:21:16.789 --> 1:21:18.576
You'd kill us all.

1:21:18.665 --> 1:21:20.497
Yes.

1:21:21.251 --> 1:21:22.662
Jean, you have to let go.

1:21:25.881 --> 1:21:27.167
Jean, let go!

1:21:28.342 --> 1:21:30.083
Let go, Jean. Let go!

1:21:33.263 --> 1:21:34.504
Let go!

1:21:40.896 --> 1:21:42.728
Guard: There's one! Get him!

1:21:45.943 --> 1:21:46.943
Jean!

1:21:54.785 --> 1:21:55.785
Jean.

1:21:56.495 --> 1:21:57.576
Jean?

1:21:58.122 --> 1:21:59.784
Jean, Jean.

1:21:59.873 --> 1:22:02.353
- Charles, what's wrong?
- I don't know. I can't read her mind.

1:22:06.130 --> 1:22:07.621
Guard 1: Come on, out!
Take him out!

1:22:07.714 --> 1:22:09.876
Come on, out, out!
You guys, come on. Train.

1:22:09.967 --> 1:22:11.277
Guard 2: You four with me, let's go!

1:22:11.301 --> 1:22:12.404
- Guard 1: Let's go!
- Guard 2: Come on, move!

1:22:12.428 --> 1:22:13.885
Guard 1: Come on.
Move, move, move!

1:22:24.356 --> 1:22:26.439
- She's alive.
- Scott, you have to get her out.

1:22:26.525 --> 1:22:27.811
You have to... no!

1:22:33.949 --> 1:22:35.110
Guard: We're clear!

1:22:56.930 --> 1:22:58.546
Guard: Last one.

1:23:00.392 --> 1:23:02.232
We need a clean sweep
on the last three blocks.

1:23:02.311 --> 1:23:03.552
Let's go!

1:23:20.120 --> 1:23:21.907
My kid used to be a fan.

1:23:31.757 --> 1:23:33.248
Raven had the right of it.

1:23:33.967 --> 1:23:36.835
Jean was never the villain.

1:23:39.765 --> 1:23:41.301
I was.

1:23:44.937 --> 1:23:46.769
I should never have lied to her.

1:23:49.233 --> 1:23:50.440
I was wrong.

1:23:53.070 --> 1:23:55.904
But this power...

1:23:57.074 --> 1:23:59.566
Inside of her,
I never put that there.

1:23:59.660 --> 1:24:02.619
I would never do anything
intentionally to hurt her.

1:24:02.704 --> 1:24:06.618
That isn't me
and this is not Jean.

1:24:07.459 --> 1:24:09.621
We can still save her.

1:24:09.711 --> 1:24:12.203
She's still Jean inside.

1:24:21.598 --> 1:24:24.011
Pilot: We're 10 miles out
from mutant containment center.

1:24:24.101 --> 1:24:25.683
Prepare for prisoner transfer.

1:24:35.529 --> 1:24:38.363
What exactly is controlling her?

1:24:38.448 --> 1:24:39.564
I don't know.

1:24:39.658 --> 1:24:42.150
But this woman, this...

1:24:42.244 --> 1:24:43.485
Thing...

1:24:43.579 --> 1:24:44.786
Has had a taste of that power,

1:24:44.871 --> 1:24:46.099
and she'll be coming back for more.

1:24:46.123 --> 1:24:47.785
She'll be coming back for Jean.

1:24:47.874 --> 1:24:50.082
Good. Let her.

1:24:50.168 --> 1:24:52.535
Charles: She'll kill her to get it.

1:24:52.629 --> 1:24:55.417
But I promise you,
the killing will not end there.

1:24:56.008 --> 1:24:58.045
Scott: That's not what raven
would have wanted.

1:24:58.135 --> 1:25:00.047
You know that.

1:25:00.804 --> 1:25:02.170
You both do.

1:25:21.325 --> 1:25:22.765
Gunner: Skipper,
are you seeing this?

1:25:24.786 --> 1:25:27.779
Alpha one, you have multiple
hostiles onboard.

1:25:27.873 --> 1:25:29.153
They're heading
towards the back.

1:25:29.207 --> 1:25:31.119
- Open four to five.
- Guard: Copy that.

1:25:31.209 --> 1:25:32.541
All right, you two,
come with me.

1:25:32.628 --> 1:25:34.745
The rest of you, stay here,
guard the prisoners!

1:25:34.838 --> 1:25:37.251
Don't be fools!
You need our help!

1:25:37.341 --> 1:25:39.128
Lead guard: Lock it down! Now!

1:25:40.886 --> 1:25:42.798
Goddamn muties
come to spring you.

1:25:42.888 --> 1:25:44.424
They're not mutants.

1:25:44.514 --> 1:25:45.908
Free us, you're going
to need our help.

1:25:45.932 --> 1:25:47.639
We're the only chance you have.

1:25:47.726 --> 1:25:49.012
Keep your mouth shut.

1:26:17.172 --> 1:26:19.289
Pilot: Mayday! Mayday!

1:26:31.144 --> 1:26:33.056
What's the status
on those mutants?

1:26:33.146 --> 1:26:35.513
Lead guard: We're falling back now!
They're not...

1:26:36.316 --> 1:26:37.932
What?

1:26:38.485 --> 1:26:40.067
They're not what?

1:26:40.153 --> 1:26:42.941
- Lead guard: They're not mutants!
- They're here for Jean.

1:26:45.033 --> 1:26:46.365
Guard: Get ready to open fire!

1:26:46.451 --> 1:26:48.317
Your kid was right about us.

1:26:48.412 --> 1:26:49.619
We could help you!

1:26:59.840 --> 1:27:00.840
Please!

1:27:03.385 --> 1:27:04.751
Guard: Fire!

1:27:16.606 --> 1:27:17.606
Guard: There's more!

1:27:45.010 --> 1:27:47.798
We only want the girl.
Step aside.

1:27:47.888 --> 1:27:48.924
No!

1:27:50.098 --> 1:27:51.384
What are you doing?

1:27:52.225 --> 1:27:54.342
What raven would have.

1:28:13.663 --> 1:28:15.120
Scott, get me to Jean!

1:28:54.996 --> 1:28:56.237
Selene!

1:28:59.626 --> 1:29:00.626
Hank!

1:29:02.045 --> 1:29:03.502
Help storm!

1:29:29.990 --> 1:29:33.324
No, no, no, no, no, please.

1:29:33.410 --> 1:29:35.823
Don't die. No.

1:30:29.549 --> 1:30:30.943
Charles: That's it,
that's it, that's it.

1:30:32.510 --> 1:30:33.671
Scott, guard the entrance.

1:30:34.804 --> 1:30:36.090
Jean, wake up.

1:30:36.181 --> 1:30:38.173
Jean, wake up.
You have to wake up now.

1:31:54.300 --> 1:31:56.041
Hank!

1:32:51.900 --> 1:32:54.358
I have no desire to fight you.

1:32:54.986 --> 1:32:56.693
I get that a lot.

1:32:57.489 --> 1:32:58.855
You wanted her dead.

1:33:00.408 --> 1:33:02.491
I had a change of heart.

1:33:26.559 --> 1:33:29.597
Charles: I was trying to protect you.

1:33:29.687 --> 1:33:33.180
I was trying to keep
the pain away, but...

1:33:33.274 --> 1:33:34.981
Jean: You just buried it.

1:33:36.736 --> 1:33:38.022
Jean.

1:33:41.241 --> 1:33:42.357
Where...?

1:33:44.828 --> 1:33:46.535
Are we inside my mind?

1:33:48.123 --> 1:33:49.989
It's more peaceful than mine.

1:33:54.212 --> 1:33:56.670
I'm so sorry for
what I did to you.

1:33:57.382 --> 1:33:58.623
I know.

1:33:58.716 --> 1:34:01.675
All I ever wanted
was to protect you

1:34:01.761 --> 1:34:03.593
and give you what you deserved.

1:34:03.680 --> 1:34:05.967
What every child deserves.

1:34:22.740 --> 1:34:24.697
A family.

1:34:25.702 --> 1:34:26.702
Yeah.

1:34:30.206 --> 1:34:32.243
I know you did what you did
out of love.

1:34:33.001 --> 1:34:34.708
I forgive you.

1:34:54.689 --> 1:34:56.806
I know what I need to do now.

1:34:57.775 --> 1:34:59.357
And what is that?

1:34:59.444 --> 1:35:01.481
Young Jean: Protect my family.

1:35:04.532 --> 1:35:05.648
Jean. Jean.

1:38:29.821 --> 1:38:31.278
You want this power?

1:38:32.448 --> 1:38:34.531
You're gonna get it.

1:38:47.463 --> 1:38:49.125
Aah! Jean!

1:38:57.598 --> 1:39:00.341
Vuk: You can't control it.

1:39:01.144 --> 1:39:06.640
If you kill me,
you'll kill them all.

1:39:23.541 --> 1:39:26.750
Your emotions make you weak.

1:39:34.051 --> 1:39:35.167
Jean.

1:39:36.179 --> 1:39:38.296
Enough.

1:39:40.516 --> 1:39:41.516
Jean!

1:39:52.445 --> 1:39:53.606
Jean: You're wrong.

1:39:55.239 --> 1:39:57.356
My emotions make me strong.

1:40:48.376 --> 1:40:49.617
She's gone.

1:41:00.846 --> 1:41:01.882
She...

1:41:04.767 --> 1:41:06.599
She's free.

1:41:49.520 --> 1:41:52.058
Jean: I know who I am now.

1:41:52.148 --> 1:41:55.983
I am not simply
what others want me to be.

1:41:56.068 --> 1:42:00.187
I am not destined
to a fate I can't control.

1:42:00.281 --> 1:42:02.739
I evolved beyond this world.

1:42:04.076 --> 1:42:06.864
This is not the end of me...

1:42:06.954 --> 1:42:08.320
Or the X-Men.

1:42:10.666 --> 1:42:12.282
It's a new beginning.

1:42:16.172 --> 1:42:18.915
Hey, slow down. Safety first.

1:43:22.905 --> 1:43:24.897
How's retirement treating you?

1:43:25.574 --> 1:43:27.440
What are you doing here, Erik?

1:43:27.535 --> 1:43:29.527
I came to see an old friend.

1:43:31.247 --> 1:43:32.454
Fancy a game?

1:43:35.376 --> 1:43:37.242
No, not today. Thank you.

1:43:41.132 --> 1:43:44.341
A long time ago,
you saved my life.

1:43:46.762 --> 1:43:48.970
Then you offered me a home.

1:43:50.266 --> 1:43:52.633
I'd like to do the same for you.

1:44:08.492 --> 1:44:10.199
Just one game.

1:44:11.495 --> 1:44:12.986
For old times' sake.

1:44:25.718 --> 1:44:27.425
I'll go easy on you.

1:44:28.846 --> 1:44:30.178
No, you won't.
