[woman] <i>The air wing has a tradition:</i>

<i>rookie pilot gets the ship</i>
<i>nobody else wants.</i>

00:47.630 --> 00:50.838
<i>In my flight group,</i>
<i>that ship was</i> Lucky Thirteen.

00:53.588 --> 00:55.422
<i>There was nothing wrong with her,</i>
<i>technically,</i>

00:55.505 --> 00:58.047
<i>but before they gave her to me,</i>
<i>she'd lost two crews.</i>

01:03.005 --> 01:04.963
<i>They recovered the ship and the dead...</i>

01:06.380 --> 01:07.630
<i>or what was left of them.</i>

01:09.422 --> 01:12.797
<i>A ship surviving when all her crew dies</i>
<i>is unusual, but </i>twice?

01:13.547 --> 01:15.380
<i>I'd never heard of such a thing before...</i>

01:16.297 --> 01:17.547
<i>or since. </i>

01:19.505 --> 01:22.005
<i>Then there was the matter of</i>
<i>her serial number:</i>

-[electronic throbbing]
<i>-13-02313.</i>

01:26.672 --> 01:31.130
<i>It not only started and ended in 13,</i>
<i>the digits totaled 13.</i>

01:32.297 --> 01:34.547
<i>Pilots are a superstitious bunch.</i>

Aye-aye, sir.

01:50.213 --> 01:53.130
I took the liberty.
Hope you don't mind, ma'am.

01:57.380 --> 02:00.213
Cutter, Colby. Good to meet you.

Hope you're not letting the talk
get to you, ma'am.

02:02.963 --> 02:04.922
I'm not the superstitious type, Jack.

02:05.422 --> 02:06.547
It's just a machine.

02:06.713 --> 02:08.672
Well, you're wrong there, ma'am.

02:09.505 --> 02:12.755
-[Colby laughs]
-Ships have personalities.

02:13.713 --> 02:15.547
