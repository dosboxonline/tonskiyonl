02:38.645 --> 02:40.203
- Excuse me.
- Yeah.

02:40.203 --> 02:41.750
I'm looking
for a mechanic.

02:42.353 --> 02:44.546
Anybody around here
fit that description?

02:45.145 --> 02:47.469
Yeah, I might be able to help you out.
What do you need?

02:48.186 --> 02:49.766
I have to get it fixed
right away.

02:49.952 --> 02:52.326
I need somebody who really knows
what they're doing.

02:53.144 --> 02:54.885
I'm not too busy,
so, what's the problem?

02:55.718 --> 02:56.908
Um, I'm not sure.

02:56.908 --> 03:00.250
Maybe, you... ought to take a look
under the hood and check it out.

03:02.020 --> 03:04.058
Yeah, maybe I better.

03:12.562 --> 03:13.937
Looks okay from here.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.015
Great customer service!

03:19.104 --> 03:21.360
A little bit of cleaning,
a little bit of paint,

03:22.188 --> 03:24.515
this place'd be ready
for business.

03:25.063 --> 03:27.780
About time for me
to play the Superbowl.

03:28.355 --> 03:30.856
Those guys are gonna
take you apart.

03:34.105 --> 03:36.179
Okay, we're gonna do it
this time, you ready?

03:39.356 --> 03:40.872
Okay, ready?

03:49.564 --> 03:53.065
To the left! Cut back!
You can do it! Cut back!

03:57.148 --> 03:58.348
Here it comes!

04:04.544 --> 04:06.038
All right!

04:09.159 --> 04:12.173
Okay. Suckers walk!
Suckers walk!

04:12.568 --> 04:14.524
Hey, hey, suckers walk!

04:17.065 --> 04:18.589
Suckers walk!

04:22.233 --> 04:24.022
Hey, Frankie,
what's that mean?

04:24.483 --> 04:26.557
It means
everything's okay.

04:27.025 --> 04:29.343
So how do you think I did?

04:29.691 --> 04:31.971
Pretty good
with the 6th graders.

04:32.483 --> 04:35.233
They know how to make
a guy feel great, don't they?

04:37.358 --> 04:40.651
Hey, what's the matter?
You don't look too happy today. Hmm?

04:41.754 --> 04:43.812
I'm missing you already.

04:44.277 --> 04:45.654
Oh, come on, pretty soon
you're gonna be so sick

04:45.654 --> 04:47.153
o' seeing me around here,
you're gonna pray

04:47.153 --> 04:49.376
you have some time on your own,
you know that?

04:49.775 --> 04:52.394
- I don't believe you.
- Oh, yeah, believe it.

04:56.484 --> 04:58.327
That's Italian!

05:02.359 --> 05:04.531
- I gotta go.
- No, no, no.

05:04.531 --> 05:05.646
- Gotta go. Yes! Yes!
- No.

05:05.646 --> 05:06.745
Yes!

05:07.151 --> 05:09.189
So, you don't think
I'm so good against 10-year-olds?

05:09.189 --> 05:11.769
Gonna say I should try
a different sport, maybe?

05:12.360 --> 05:14.189
- Yeah, golf. Golf.
- Golf?

05:14.189 --> 05:15.386
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:15.527 --> 05:17.601
- Wanna see my swing?
- I'd like to see you in whites.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.762
Like those old guys?

05:21.193 --> 05:23.202
Can you see me
on a golf course, huh?

05:24.188 --> 05:28.102
Well, you're lucky I have a sense
of humor. I would take that personally!

05:54.821 --> 05:57.653
Time to go to work.
All right, be good!

06:01.654 --> 06:04.901
Wait a minute.
I got something for you.

06:06.154 --> 06:07.434
What's this?

06:08.446 --> 06:10.276
It's supposed
to bring you luck.

06:13.613 --> 06:14.643
It's nice.

06:16.405 --> 06:18.123
Thanks.

06:20.571 --> 06:22.329
I could use it.

06:38.905 --> 06:39.510
Hey, Rod.

06:39.510 --> 06:40.896
Hey, how you doin', Frank?
Good furlough?

06:40.896 --> 06:43.436
- The best, man.
- Hey, did you see that game?

06:43.905 --> 06:46.192
- No, I'm afraid I missed it.
- Hey, it was awesome.

06:46.656 --> 06:47.215
Was it really good?

06:47.215 --> 06:49.372
Yes, it was. You missed
a good one, buddy.

06:50.697 --> 06:53.262
I have a feeling I had more fun
than you this weekend.

06:54.073 --> 06:56.023
I'll bet you did!

06:58.407 --> 07:02.136
Here you go, Roger.
So, how's the Diesel running, Jimmy?

07:02.240 --> 07:03.448
- Forget it.
- Uh-huh.

07:03.448 --> 07:06.588
It stops, it stalls, it rolls.
It don't go. I don't know

07:06.588 --> 07:07.693
what to do
with the damn thing.

07:07.693 --> 07:09.809
- You got water in the fuel line.
- Open your mouth.

07:11.032 --> 07:12.648
- You sure?
- I'd bet time on it.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.607
- Take it off.
- All right.

07:17.740 --> 07:19.185
See you later, Jimmy!

07:20.366 --> 07:23.376
- I'll give you more starch next time.
- Yeah, do that.

07:24.649 --> 07:26.949
Say "Hi" to the wife.
How ya doin'?

07:28.199 --> 07:29.474
Yo, Frank!

07:29.509 --> 07:32.483
- What'd you bring me?
- Hey, here, go kill yourself!

07:33.242 --> 07:34.487
I thought
you'd bring me a girl.

07:34.487 --> 07:37.468
A girl? Had one for you but, uh,
the guards liked her so much

07:37.468 --> 07:39.433
they decided to keep her
at the front gate!

07:39.468 --> 07:41.810
I knew that shit was gonna happen.
I can't depend on you.

07:41.951 --> 07:44.043
Look, let me ask you somethin' else.
Did you go see the garage?

07:44.043 --> 07:46.174
- Oh, the garage... Beautiful, beautiful...
- Beautiful?

07:46.174 --> 07:48.417
- Johnny, beautiful.
- A garage, I never stuck up as beautiful.

07:48.417 --> 07:51.325
- And this one is. It's great.
- Look, can I tell you something?

07:51.326 --> 07:51.849
Yeah.

07:51.849 --> 07:53.567
- I'm gettin' outta here soon.
- Uh-huh.

07:53.567 --> 07:55.208
- I don't come cheap...
- Mmm-hmm.

07:55.208 --> 07:56.927
... but, you know, I know my way
around cars.

07:56.927 --> 07:58.888
- Yeah.
- You need any help, call me!

07:58.888 --> 08:00.668
Hey, Johnny, I fix 'em,
I don't steal 'em!

08:00.668 --> 08:02.082
I was framed!

08:04.016 --> 08:05.777
What? I was framed!

08:33.828 --> 08:36.826
- What is this shit there, Jimmy?
- I don't know, but it's official.

08:56.161 --> 08:58.039
Crack, 210!

09:00.745 --> 09:03.309
On your feet, Leone!
On your feet!

09:04.037 --> 09:05.108
- What d'you want?
- Take 'im!

09:05.108 --> 09:06.609
What are you doin' here?

09:07.204 --> 09:10.724
- You're being transferred!
- Transferred where? What the hell...

09:14.204 --> 09:16.954
- For Christ's sake, that's not necessary.
- Step back, officer.

09:17.413 --> 09:20.660
- The prisoner's in our custody now.
- You got the wrong guy!

09:31.080 --> 09:32.771
Take me where?

09:34.622 --> 09:36.890
- Move it!
- What'd I do? What'd I do?

09:44.832 --> 09:47.312
Unlock it!
Get in there!

09:47.623 --> 09:49.811
What'd I do? Goddamn!

09:55.207 --> 09:58.122
Where are we going?
Hey! Talk to me!

10:44.417 --> 10:46.544
Let's go, Leone!
Come on!

10:47.168 --> 10:49.819
- Get his ass out here!
- C'mon! Get off!

10:50.891 --> 10:52.237
Where the hell are we?

10:52.748 --> 10:54.624
- I wanna know where the hell we are.
- Shut up!

10:54.624 --> 10:58.108
You got the wrong man!
You made a mistake!

11:00.710 --> 11:02.809
There's no mistake.

11:07.169 --> 11:08.958
Welcome to Gateway,
Leone.

11:10.002 --> 11:13.160
- Drumgoole?
- That's warden Drumgoole, convict.

11:13.461 --> 11:15.425
- Captain.
- Move 'im!

11:22.377 --> 11:27.098
You'll be issued 1 bar of soap,
2 rolls of toilet paper per month.

11:27.170 --> 11:29.493
Somebody steals...
Turn your ass around!

11:29.961 --> 11:32.011
Somebody steals 'em
or you lose 'em,

11:32.011 --> 11:34.817
you will be wiping your ass
with your shirt.

11:34.837 --> 11:39.127
You have one uniform.
Your number is 510. Remember it!

11:40.336 --> 11:44.875
This is C-Wing. You will eat, shower
and take your yard time with your wing.

11:45.337 --> 11:47.955
There's six counts a day.
Miss one, you're in the hole.

11:47.990 --> 11:51.498
Miss two, and I'll personally
put you in the house of pain.

11:54.336 --> 11:57.122
Convict!. Two things.

11:57.587 --> 11:59.624
One: I am Meissner.

12:00.087 --> 12:03.251
Two: Never fuck with Meissner.

12:03.712 --> 12:05.224
Inside!

12:11.880 --> 12:15.504
- Sir, what about the cuffs?
- Let 'im get used to 'em.

12:26.716 --> 12:28.956
Better watch
your back, man!

13:05.382 --> 13:10.005
<i>Officer Fryberg, 5235!</i>

13:22.508 --> 13:23.254
19-1!

13:32.592 --> 13:34.168
19-1! Crack it!

13:40.091 --> 13:42.663
Oh, yeah, you better
not eyeball me, boy!

13:43.467 --> 13:45.770
So, how were
your accommodations last night?

13:46.173 --> 13:48.380
Like your mama
used to do you?

13:49.675 --> 13:52.763
- You did his mama, didn't you?
- Twice!

14:16.528 --> 14:21.053
Hey! Open the door!
You hear me?

14:22.677 --> 14:23.997
Hello, Frank.

14:25.594 --> 14:27.901
In the old days,
the warden would've come down that...

14:27.901 --> 14:31.581
private passageway, from
his office to this execution chamber

14:32.122 --> 14:35.719
to witness the... putting
to death of a criminal.

14:35.886 --> 14:39.781
120 men and 4 women
were electrocuted in that chair

14:39.781 --> 14:42.845
before it was retired.
Beautiful, isn't it?

14:43.152 --> 14:45.045
When I came to Gateway,
it was falling apart,

14:45.045 --> 14:47.969
so I had it restored,
put it back into perfect working order

14:48.333 --> 14:51.604
to remind me
of how things ought to be.

14:52.150 --> 14:54.917
It's nearly 5 years since
you escaped from Treadmore, Frank.

14:54.917 --> 14:57.176
Time flies when
you're having fun.

14:57.180 --> 14:59.373
In all the years that
I was warden there,

14:59.373 --> 15:02.632
you're the only man
that ever made it over my wall.

15:02.971 --> 15:05.836
- So I read in the papers.
- Yes, of course you did.

15:05.836 --> 15:07.340
You and your lawyer
saw to it

15:07.340 --> 15:09.729
that everything made
in into the papers, didn't you?

15:09.764 --> 15:12.954
The media... yeah,
distorting the truth.

15:13.324 --> 15:16.497
Distorting the facts.
Making a criminal into a hero,

15:16.497 --> 15:21.138
and a warden into a criminal.
You took my future away from me!

15:21.254 --> 15:23.472
You and those bleeding heart
politicians.

15:23.472 --> 15:26.114
They sent you to Northwood.
That's a country club.

15:26.269 --> 15:30.335
I ended up here in Gateway,
the worst shit-hole in the system.

15:30.805 --> 15:33.874
You don't remember, do you?
I asked you.

15:33.875 --> 15:36.385
No, I-I begged you, Drumgoole.
Do you remember that?

15:36.873 --> 15:39.142
I had two weeks to go
before I was released.

15:39.142 --> 15:42.079
And all I asked for is
one hour.. one hour to visit

15:42.079 --> 15:44.244
with that old man
before he died. You remember that?

15:44.244 --> 15:47.964
- I was doing my job.
- There's a lot of ways to do your job!

15:47.964 --> 15:50.291
I mean, you could have given me a...
an escorted leave,

15:50.291 --> 15:52.513
you had armed guards!
You could have done that for me.

15:51.973 --> 15:53.899
You broke the law.

15:54.072 --> 15:57.045
You broke the law
and I was punished.

15:57.090 --> 16:00.910
- I got 5 goddamn years I paid my debt!
- To the state, not to me!

16:00.910 --> 16:02.350
But you're going to...

16:02.751 --> 16:05.836
All I know is I've only got
six months left from my sentence.

16:05.933 --> 16:09.528
In Gateway, six months could be
a lifetime. Anything could happen.

16:09.528 --> 16:13.634
This is hard time, Frank. You've
no rights here unless I give them to you.

16:13.961 --> 16:17.330
You feel no pleasure unless
I tell you you can. This is hell...

16:18.402 --> 16:20.763
and I'm going to give you
the guided tour.

16:25.225 --> 16:27.678
Okay, tough guy.
Open your mouth!

16:28.142 --> 16:31.631
Roll your tongue around!
You tryin' to kiss me, huh?

16:32.683 --> 16:34.411
Lemme see you ears!

16:43.810 --> 16:45.817
What are you looking at,
asshole?

16:46.143 --> 16:48.098
- Did you check his nose?
- Checked it.

16:48.559 --> 16:49.554
Good.

16:54.794 --> 16:57.806
<i>This is a delousing chamber.
Do not breathe!</i>

16:57.806 --> 17:00.575
<i>Xylon-profic gas can be
harmful to your lungs.</i>

17:00.575 --> 17:02.294
<i>Stand with your legs apart,</i>

17:03.019 --> 17:05.702
<i>arms extended out
and away from your body!</i>

17:05.702 --> 17:07.596
<i>When I tell you,
I want you to take a deep breath</i>

17:07.596 --> 17:09.651
<i>and hold it for 30 seconds.</i>

17:10.144 --> 17:11.702
Start now!

17:31.811 --> 17:33.344
Ten seconds.

17:43.812 --> 17:47.675
Not yet!
He can take more.

18:10.396 --> 18:11.862
Mr. Braden,

18:12.438 --> 18:15.380
you will learn that
inmates are physically more capable

18:15.380 --> 18:17.178
than you could imagine.

18:18.272 --> 18:23.872
If you underestimate them...
it will cost you dearly.

19:10.816 --> 19:13.786
Watch out for the birds!
What the hell you doin'?

19:13.786 --> 19:15.095
Sorry.

19:22.817 --> 19:24.877
Yo, Billy,
get that weight!

19:44.192 --> 19:47.614
Move it, ace.
That's my spot!

20:03.814 --> 20:06.914
Uh-oh. That's my spot too!

20:09.194 --> 20:12.358
- Any spot in here that isn't yours?
- Nope. They're all mine.

20:12.819 --> 20:14.913
You wanna use it,
you gotta pay.

20:19.778 --> 20:22.184
Not so fast, ace!
I'm not gonna gouge you.

20:22.653 --> 20:27.003
That little thing around your neck,
That'll buy you a spot for the day.

20:29.237 --> 20:31.109
I'll put a fucking hole
in your heart!

20:31.570 --> 20:33.478
Break it up!
Break it up!

20:33.945 --> 20:35.687
I said break it up,
back off!

20:36.737 --> 20:39.248
Spread 'em! Back off!

20:39.988 --> 20:42.048
All right, Weber,
drop the shank in the dirt!

20:42.754 --> 20:44.531
There ain't no shank,
Braden.

20:45.974 --> 20:48.561
- All right, let's go!
- You, motherfucker!

20:49.029 --> 20:53.188
- Spread 'em! Spread 'em, goddamn it!
- You're making a big mistake, asshole!

20:55.153 --> 20:57.209
You're going in the hole
for carrying a shank.

20:57.244 --> 20:59.982
Where's your witness?
Where's your evidence?

20:59.982 --> 21:01.248
Well, where is it?

21:02.013 --> 21:03.620
- He saw it!
- He didn't see anything.

21:03.620 --> 21:07.050
- You saw him carrying the shank, right?
- I didn't see nothin'.

21:08.488 --> 21:12.768
- You're making a bad mistake, Braden!
- Get him the fuck out of here!

21:19.738 --> 21:23.472
He would have put that shank in you.
What did you cover for him for?

21:24.656 --> 21:27.189
You got your rules,
we got ours.

21:43.017 --> 21:48.007
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. I do know
the face, and I do know the name.

21:48.007 --> 21:50.782
Hey, Frank.
Frank Leone, right?

21:50.972 --> 21:53.548
Frank, the name's Dallas. I was in
Treadmore, man, when you were there.

21:53.548 --> 21:55.009
Right before you busted out!

21:55.408 --> 21:57.233
Ah, yeah, you were in A-Block,
weren't you?

21:57.553 --> 21:59.508
Yeah, yeah, that's right!
I was-I was in A-Block.

21:59.508 --> 22:00.831
You got
a good memory, man.

22:01.575 --> 22:03.993
Treadmore doesn't have
an A-Block. Watch your feet!

22:04.331 --> 22:08.849
Okay... dig it.
Look, look, look, look.

22:08.849 --> 22:11.473
- I was there on transfer, man.
- Mmm-hmm.

22:11.473 --> 22:12.760
Transfer.
Less than two hours,

22:12.760 --> 22:14.236
but I know
all about you, man.

22:14.236 --> 22:17.488
You're looking at
a downhome historian and devoted fan.

22:17.488 --> 22:18.631
D.T.A.

22:20.992 --> 22:23.944
D.T.A. Okay.
What's that, man?

22:25.492 --> 22:29.154
Don't trust anybody.
Words to survive by. Watch your feet!

22:30.909 --> 22:33.225
D.T. A. Okay.
- D.T.A.

22:34.243 --> 22:36.096
Oh, come on, you gotta
trust somebody, right, Frank?

22:36.096 --> 22:37.753
Let me hip you
to the joint, okay, man?

22:37.753 --> 22:41.902
See this fat tub o' shit back there?
Now, that's Manly. His partner's Wiley.

22:41.902 --> 22:43.539
They're a couple
o' sadistic pigs, man.

22:43.539 --> 22:45.497
They ain't happy unless
they put the hurt too,

22:45.497 --> 22:46.605
if you know what I mean.

22:46.894 --> 22:49.396
All right? I mean, if the warden
wants to put the boot to you,

22:49.646 --> 22:51.450
he uses them. Okay?

22:51.701 --> 22:53.772
And, look, this dude over here.
The black dude in the booth.

22:53.772 --> 22:55.934
That's captain Meissner,
all right?

22:56.041 --> 22:59.696
Now, he runs the guards, okay?
And he's one bad dude, okay?

22:59.696 --> 23:02.104
We already met. Look, I gotta do
my work, okay? Watch your feet!

23:02.104 --> 23:08.321
Okay. Okay. Okay.
Cool. Cool, man. So, listen, Frank.

23:08.321 --> 23:12.173
Frank, Frank, Frank. When you decide
to make your break, okay,

23:12.173 --> 23:15.832
and I know you will,
you come talk to me, all right?

23:15.832 --> 23:18.143
You come talk to Dallas.
Okay?

23:18.143 --> 23:20.979
Anything you want,
anything you need, man,

23:20.979 --> 23:24.622
I can get it.
Anything. All right? Okay?

23:24.953 --> 23:28.422
- No way! No damn way!
- C'mon, Eclipse...

23:28.422 --> 23:30.687
What're you talkin' about, man?
Aren't you the guy who's always cryin'

23:30.687 --> 23:32.271
about how you need a man
who knows his engines?

23:32.271 --> 23:33.777
Well, I brought you
the man, homes.

23:33.777 --> 23:37.626
Look, don't "homes" me! The only thing
you brought here is trouble!

23:38.338 --> 23:39.591
C'mon, Eclipse!

23:40.011 --> 23:41.894
You know, I heard
all about you, Leone.

23:41.894 --> 23:44.808
And whatever's between you
and Drumgoole ain't comin' in here.

23:45.037 --> 23:48.020
As you can see, the boys ain't got
no problem with me.

23:48.020 --> 23:50.407
And I ain't got
no problem with the boys.

23:55.248 --> 23:58.296
Hey! Hey! Hey, hey! Come on, Eclipse.
You're makin' me look bad, man.

23:58.296 --> 24:00.723
I promised the dude
a job and you owe me.

24:00.872 --> 24:04.178
Hey, look. I don't owe you
or nobody nothin'.

24:04.372 --> 24:09.033
Hey, you! You! Get your face outta
that motor! Get your face outta there.

24:09.333 --> 24:10.616
You don't know nothin'
about motors.

24:10.616 --> 24:13.390
Stay outta that motor!
Stay away from it, okay? Okay?

24:13.390 --> 24:16.779
It's just been a long time since
I've seen an old 365 small-block.

24:16.779 --> 24:19.189
Well, look good, then!
Cause that's the last time

24:19.189 --> 24:20.368
you're gonna see one
in this shop!

24:20.368 --> 24:23.941
Hey, come on, man. Frank,
we can work this out, man,

24:23.941 --> 24:25.060
we're all gentlemen here!

24:25.060 --> 24:27.038
That's all right, it's his place.
He knows what he wants.

24:27.038 --> 24:29.619
It's okay. Thanks anyway.

24:33.594 --> 24:35.457
Thanks a lot. You made me
look beautiful, man.

24:35.457 --> 24:37.763
I appreciate
the endorsement.

24:37.934 --> 24:39.727
Hey, Frank, hold on, man!
Hold on!

24:40.914 --> 24:42.312
You didn't want
this job anyway, man.

24:42.312 --> 24:45.029
Grease under your fingernails,
oil on your clothes, you know...

24:45.029 --> 24:46.797
Don't worry, man,
you're in good hands,

24:46.797 --> 24:49.186
- I'm gonna take care o' you.
- That's what I'm afraid of.

24:50.666 --> 24:51.465
All right?

24:52.790 --> 24:55.020
Prison guard, here!
Prison joke.

24:55.020 --> 24:57.681
Hey, I lost my watch, man. Why
don't you gimme a hand looking for it?

24:57.681 --> 24:59.968
Roll your ass on
outta here, man!

25:00.332 --> 25:04.876
Officer Vazquez, you ought to put on
a few pounds. You look a little frail.

25:05.207 --> 25:08.263
Hey, Frank. Listen, man,
I mean what I said, okay?

25:08.263 --> 25:09.414
I'm gonna get you
something good,

25:09.414 --> 25:11.499
something easy,
something cool...

25:11.500 --> 25:12.500
You're gonna love it, man.

25:12.589 --> 25:14.150
All right, now shut up
and get inside!

25:14.150 --> 25:16.065
Shut up and get inside!

25:21.958 --> 25:24.072
Here's your shit
from Norwood, Leone!

25:28.991 --> 25:31.749
All right! Lock in!

25:44.376 --> 25:45.371
Problem?

25:48.127 --> 25:50.201
No, I got no problems.

25:55.586 --> 25:57.561
And I wanna know
what the hell is going on.

25:57.561 --> 26:01.389
Look, miss, all I know is that
he's in the general population with...

26:01.389 --> 26:04.179
I don't give a damn about
the general population!

26:04.179 --> 26:05.785
I wanna know
about Frank Leone!

26:05.785 --> 26:07.833
- And I'm not leaving...
- Calm down, miss!

26:08.462 --> 26:09.521
Leone's all right.

26:09.967 --> 26:13.405
He was a model prisoner at Norwood.
Why did you bring him here?

26:14.462 --> 26:16.665
Routine transfer.

26:25.852 --> 26:27.818
- Hey, Frank?
- What?

26:27.819 --> 26:28.793
Hey, man.

26:29.926 --> 26:34.493
- Whoo! It's hot in here, man!
- Yeah, I know. But at least it's easy.

26:34.962 --> 26:37.409
I know, man, I'm sorry.
I didn't do too good.

26:38.712 --> 26:40.464
No time to go on the negative.
Now, walk with me, man.

26:40.464 --> 26:42.675
I gotta show you
something. It's important. Okay?

26:43.004 --> 26:45.304
- Nah, nah. Here, you try.
- Oh, no. Come on, man.

26:45.304 --> 26:48.169
- Why not, you'll like it, really. Try it.
- I'm not into hard labor, man.

26:48.310 --> 26:49.816
It's cool. It's easy.

26:49.816 --> 26:52.937
Okay. There.
I'm burnt out! Come on, man!

26:53.563 --> 26:55.232
Come on,
you're gonna love this.

26:57.254 --> 26:59.024
Watch the steam, Frank!

27:04.464 --> 27:08.028
I got these off this old trustee.
He did the plumbing here for 20 years.

27:08.028 --> 27:10.982
Everybody thought he was a nut.
Doesn't mean he wasn't smart.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.720
- Come on, hurry up.
- All right, cool.

27:16.339 --> 27:19.135
The tunnels, under every cellblock,
okay? Right here.

27:19.135 --> 27:21.038
They lead to
the steam plant, okay?

27:21.038 --> 27:23.910
I go out across the steam lines.
Dig this.

27:24.609 --> 27:29.830
I shimmy, okay? Across the
steam pipes to the sally port, okay?

27:29.971 --> 27:33.415
Over there, there's trucks comin'
and goin'. I wait for my time...

27:34.757 --> 27:38.390
I'm on a truck that's leavin'.
I'm dearly departing Dallas, man. Huh?

27:40.568 --> 27:43.204
Am I keepin' you awake, am I, man?
Come on, you're the doctor. Operate.

27:43.204 --> 27:44.618
I want
your professional opinion.

27:45.210 --> 27:48.387
All right. Let's run it backwards.
Since I've been here, I see these trucks.

27:48.387 --> 27:50.147
They stop running
by nine o'clock.

27:50.147 --> 27:53.277
At nine o'clock, most of the tower guards
are waiting and running full staff.

27:53.277 --> 27:55.459
At nine o'clock,
all the inmates are awake.

27:55.633 --> 27:56.693
So, before you go ten feet,

27:56.693 --> 27:58.743
every con the joint's
gonna know you're gone.

27:58.743 --> 28:01.321
And this thing, about what
would you say this shimmy thing...?

28:01.321 --> 28:03.224
Sh-shimmy slide.
Shimmy slide.

28:03.224 --> 28:04.908
You think
you're gonna shimmy slide

28:04.908 --> 28:08.719
across 200 yards of steam pipe
runnin' full at it at 160 degrees

28:08.719 --> 28:09.868
and get away with it?

28:09.868 --> 28:11.087
You try, they're gonna
change your name

28:11.087 --> 28:14.258
from Departing Dallas
to Deep-Fried Dallas.

28:19.675 --> 28:21.884
- Just a thought, man, you know?
- The thought that counts.

28:21.884 --> 28:23.986
That's right. Look,
I gotta-I gotta plane to catch.

28:23.986 --> 28:26.386
- Okay, Frank. Thanks a lot.
- Hey, Dallas!

28:27.258 --> 28:28.378
You got a cigarette?

28:31.176 --> 28:34.174
It's my last one, man.
Um, here, finish that up.

28:34.634 --> 28:37.223
I know it ain't much, but
it's the thought that counts, right?

28:57.486 --> 28:58.789
Right, last call.

28:59.333 --> 29:01.933
Mess hall, last call.
Last call.

29:05.636 --> 29:10.179
Uh, looks like some delicious garbage
stew. Just like mom used to make.

29:10.673 --> 29:12.090
That's why I shot her.

29:14.011 --> 29:16.664
- Can I have some more gravy, please?
- Gravy?

29:16.929 --> 29:18.613
- You want some gravy?
- Yeah.

29:19.730 --> 29:21.600
- Here's your gravy.
- Come on, you got it all over my food!

29:21.600 --> 29:22.556
Move it!

29:22.557 --> 29:24.645
- What's your problem, man?
- Nothing. Move it!

29:25.193 --> 29:28.012
- What's that kid's story?
- In for murder.

29:28.471 --> 29:31.888
Says it's a bad rap, claims he was just
in the wrong place at the wrong time.

29:32.157 --> 29:34.461
Waitin' in the car while his buddy
went for a six-pack.

29:34.916 --> 29:36.615
Didn't know
the guy was packing heat.

29:36.615 --> 29:38.273
Boom-boom-boom.
Two guys dead.

29:38.273 --> 29:41.770
Kid's doing
the Big Bitch now: Double life.

29:41.971 --> 29:44.850
He'll make parole
when he's about... 400!

29:45.472 --> 29:46.633
Move it!

29:47.097 --> 29:49.563
What are you,
a slow study or what?

29:50.472 --> 29:51.585
Screw that guy.

29:53.049 --> 29:54.487
Look, Frank, man,
I didn't get a chance

29:54.487 --> 29:56.041
to make a reservation,
you know?

29:56.041 --> 29:59.003
So... why don't we, uh,
we get a seat over there?

30:01.042 --> 30:02.089
Hey, what are you doin'?

30:02.089 --> 30:03.618
I'm takin' this.
You got a problem with that?

30:03.618 --> 30:05.082
Why don't you go
take somethin' else?

30:05.082 --> 30:06.882
Open your mouth, Marjorie,
wait for the steak.

30:08.138 --> 30:10.593
- I don't need it. Want some cake?
- Are you chumpin' off on me?

30:10.868 --> 30:12.754
- I'm not hungry. You want it?
- Who are you?

30:12.986 --> 30:14.748
Nobody. Here.

30:16.349 --> 30:19.424
I'm on a diet.
This spot taken?

30:19.889 --> 30:21.657
Why don't you stand up
to that fat dirtbag?

30:21.657 --> 30:24.413
Hey, shut up, punk. He just
saved you a lot of healing, okay?

30:25.847 --> 30:27.133
What's your name?

30:28.056 --> 30:28.865
What's the difference?

30:28.865 --> 30:31.403
Why does anybody need a name
in a joint like this?

30:31.403 --> 30:33.191
It helps
when you get mail.

30:34.140 --> 30:37.815
Oh, yeah? I need a name?
They call me Killer.

30:37.932 --> 30:39.475
Killer? Hmm.
That's original.

30:39.475 --> 30:42.025
You think that up yourself,
or someone give you a hand with it?

30:42.248 --> 30:45.577
- Yeah. I call myself what I want, okay?
- Okay.

30:46.057 --> 30:48.583
Killer, this is Dallas.
And I'm Frank.

30:49.025 --> 30:50.807
Dallas, what do you think
this is here?

30:51.320 --> 30:53.147
- Wanna give me an idea?
- These might be peas.

30:53.392 --> 30:56.717
Then, again, um, they might not.
They might be toxic waste.

30:56.849 --> 30:58.434
Who cares?
It's all crap, anyway.

30:59.124 --> 31:01.218
Eat your vegetables, man,
to grow big and strong.

31:01.218 --> 31:03.473
Hey, man, stick your vegetables.
Nobody asked you!

31:03.473 --> 31:06.911
Watch it! You know, we got
about 325 other killers in here.

31:06.911 --> 31:09.061
Most of 'em, unlike you,
live up to it, punk.

31:09.184 --> 31:10.842
- Put your leg in the aisle.
- What?

31:10.842 --> 31:13.138
Put your leg in the aisle.
Be ready to move.

31:13.372 --> 31:15.719
Hey, nobody tells me
nothin', all right?

31:42.142 --> 31:43.773
You always gotta be ready
to move first.

31:44.244 --> 31:46.903
You just might make it
to first base in this place.

31:49.476 --> 31:52.607
First base.
There's a name for him, huh?

32:02.227 --> 32:04.897
- Man, it's good to be outside.
- It's cold outside.

32:04.897 --> 32:07.591
Eh, it's not that bad.
Listen, it's good to keep movin'.

32:08.186 --> 32:10.131
How come you always got
like this up attitude here?

32:10.131 --> 32:13.272
How could you keep
an up attitude in a joint like this?

32:13.520 --> 32:17.465
It's a mindset, kid. Your body has to be
in here, but your brain doesn't, right?

32:18.025 --> 32:21.373
As long as you keep movin'...
you don't become a piece of this place.

32:21.645 --> 32:23.635
- What's that? Like guru stuff?
- Yes, guru stuff.

32:23.635 --> 32:26.920
- Maybe I should become a guru.
- You gettin' sarcastic?

32:28.479 --> 32:29.641
Fuckin' birds!

32:33.145 --> 32:34.971
Fuckin' birds
don't eat in the rain.

32:36.479 --> 32:38.743
Yeah, well,
they'll come back.

32:38.743 --> 32:41.733
Hey, uh, you save your bread
for me tomorrow?

32:42.333 --> 32:44.502
Yeah, sure.
Put that on your list, okay?

32:44.502 --> 32:46.016
- Okay.
- Thanks.

32:47.622 --> 32:50.523
Why you talkin' crazy, man?
It's a waste of time.

32:51.814 --> 32:53.861
To you, it's a waste of time.
To him, it's all he's got.

32:54.108 --> 32:55.556
That's more than you got.

32:55.855 --> 32:57.377
In here, you gotta
respect something.

32:57.630 --> 33:02.360
You don't get much, and what you got,
you gotta protect. You know that?

33:02.395 --> 33:05.494
You don't know nothin' yet.
Come on, let's run.

33:12.668 --> 33:14.374
- Come on, Frank.
- Bitch, bitch, bitch.

33:14.374 --> 33:17.935
I'm gonna get wet.
Send you my laundry bill.

33:28.440 --> 33:30.430
Feel something, Leone?

33:33.356 --> 33:35.927
Wanna play?
We're a man short.

33:43.770 --> 33:46.593
Hey! I'm talkin' to you!

33:48.148 --> 33:52.813
Hey, punk! When you gonna paint
your nails and answer the name "bitch"?

33:54.399 --> 33:57.003
Hey, you know you got a big mouth?
Why don't you keep it shut?

33:57.003 --> 33:59.791
Why, you, little motherfucker,
I'll tear your goddamn ass off!

33:59.791 --> 34:02.266
Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Hey!
You wanna play? We'll play.

34:03.191 --> 34:05.745
You talk too much.
Hey, let's play.

34:05.745 --> 34:10.465
Goddamn right we'll play.
You and I'll play later, you little fuck!

34:24.234 --> 34:28.853
You want more, Leone? We got more
for you. Come on! Come on!

34:33.277 --> 34:36.342
- Stay down, fucker!
- That's a cheap shot!

34:40.360 --> 34:45.647
- What kind of game is this?
- This ain't no game, man. This is a lesson.

35:04.820 --> 35:06.501
- Got somethin' to say?
- Yeah.

35:06.501 --> 35:08.593
- Say it! Say it!
- First down!

35:08.593 --> 35:11.689
Fuck you. That's your last one!
You're dead, Leone!

35:13.279 --> 35:15.604
You'll never last
the fuckin' game!

35:31.654 --> 35:34.007
Get in there, hit 'im!
Come on, Red, get in there.

35:35.802 --> 35:36.636
Set!

35:37.571 --> 35:40.893
Hut-one. Hut-two. Hut-three.

36:04.281 --> 36:06.037
I'll beat you up, homes.

36:18.163 --> 36:19.434
All right, Frank!

36:22.448 --> 36:23.748
Get 'im!

36:33.965 --> 36:36.826
Hut-one. Hut-two.
Hut-three.

36:47.783 --> 36:52.869
Fuck up! Get over on that other team.
That's who you're playin' for anyway.

36:58.950 --> 37:00.230
What took you so long?

37:00.742 --> 37:05.627
Looks like you need the help... and
I need the exercise. So, call the play!

37:08.992 --> 37:10.398
You're dead, Leone!

37:24.469 --> 37:29.186
- Damn! What hit me?
- F-train, son! F-train.

37:40.911 --> 37:43.522
Don't lay down on me now.
Come on!

37:47.869 --> 37:50.109
Come on, Leone.
Come on, you son of a bitch!

37:50.577 --> 37:52.498
All right,
I am goin' over tackle on "two".

37:53.488 --> 37:54.787
All right, Frank!

37:55.469 --> 37:56.716
Ready!

37:59.953 --> 38:00.948
Set!

38:01.411 --> 38:03.865
- You're dead!
- Hut-one!

38:06.411 --> 38:07.540
Hut-two!

38:12.804 --> 38:13.821
Go, baby!

38:17.605 --> 38:19.116
Come on, Frank!

38:33.924 --> 38:35.313
We did it!

38:35.314 --> 38:36.314
Hey, come on Wiley.
Come on, man!

39:02.372 --> 39:04.446
Hey, put up, Wiley.
Come on, man!

39:06.497 --> 39:11.132
Next time I want...
you give.

39:20.415 --> 39:25.118
Move it. Out. The game is over.
Let's go. You don't listen, do you?

39:26.662 --> 39:30.466
- You okay? Come on. Come on, Frank.
- Put 'im down!

39:30.501 --> 39:32.389
You ain't no doctor.

39:32.791 --> 39:35.954
He's on his own.
Get inside.

39:41.124 --> 39:43.154
Real badass, huh?

39:45.082 --> 39:47.097
See you inside, Leone.

40:47.919 --> 40:50.324
You won't break me!

41:16.504 --> 41:19.418
You still interested in the job?

41:22.503 --> 41:23.812
Yeah, I am.

41:42.297 --> 41:46.125
You sure know your way
around an engine. Who taught you?

41:46.125 --> 41:49.217
This old man... named Galleti.

41:50.047 --> 41:52.036
Took me off the street
when I was 14 years old.

41:52.581 --> 41:53.700
Taught me that
I could do something

41:53.700 --> 41:55.863
besides hangin' out
on corners all the time.

41:56.339 --> 41:58.413
- Where is everybody?
- It's quittin' time.

41:58.881 --> 42:01.832
We got the place all to ourselves.
Is that what you broke out for?

42:02.298 --> 42:03.598
Yeah, I owed 'im.

42:03.794 --> 42:06.425
Tell me, what put you in the, uh,
joint in the first place?

42:08.110 --> 42:09.969
One night these punks
broke into the garage

42:09.969 --> 42:12.032
and put a beating
on old man Galleti.

42:12.590 --> 42:15.195
And the whole neighborhood
knew about it. The cops knew about it.

42:15.714 --> 42:20.374
But I guess these punks were connected,
so, uh, the cops didn't do anything. I did.

42:20.624 --> 42:22.523
So, after all the smoke
had cleared...

42:22.922 --> 42:24.360
these guys ended up
in the hospital,

42:24.360 --> 42:28.680
and I ended up doin' 18 months
in Treadmore for aggravated assault.

42:28.898 --> 42:31.960
- Care to join me in a little contraband?
- Why not?

42:34.799 --> 42:37.513
I can see why they call you Eclipse.
What are you, about 6'7"?

42:37.668 --> 42:40.986
- I do block a lot of sun, don't I?
- That you do.

42:41.264 --> 42:44.337
I had a guy on the outside that used
to get me good Havanas.

42:44.337 --> 42:48.239
- Uh-huh.
- Not this crap. But someday...

42:48.883 --> 42:51.184
- Someday...
- Yeah, someday.

42:52.800 --> 42:55.234
- That's not bad.
- At least they're cheap.

42:59.383 --> 43:01.642
Eclipse, what do you
got hidin' back there?

43:03.550 --> 43:04.830
That's my baby.

43:08.217 --> 43:11.962
- Good body work.
- Call this here vehicle Maybelline.

43:12.425 --> 43:14.597
- Hello, Maybelline.
- Yeah, this is my baby.

43:14.597 --> 43:15.913
Nice.

43:17.842 --> 43:22.002
- Come on!
- 1965 Ford Mustang, V-8,

43:22.468 --> 43:24.567
2-89, 1-20-25 horse power.

43:25.300 --> 43:26.826
When was the last time
you turned this thing over?

43:26.826 --> 43:28.739
She's been dead
for 15 years.

43:28.936 --> 43:33.426
Couple guys tried to get her goin'
and couldn't. I'm a body man myself.

43:34.403 --> 43:37.753
- Mind if I give it a try?
- It's a dead issue, Frank.

43:40.177 --> 43:42.455
Nothing's dead around here
until it's buried, isn't it?

43:47.511 --> 43:49.999
Save the headstone, man.
Save the headstone.

46:25.904 --> 46:29.030
Hey! Nothing's dead until it's buried.
Did I tell you that?

46:29.030 --> 46:31.674
- Yeah!
- In like Johnson!

46:33.836 --> 46:34.760
I love it.

46:37.561 --> 46:40.121
A toast! Let's do the poem,
all right? From the top.

46:40.122 --> 46:40.836
What poem?

46:40.836 --> 46:44.168
- Hey, "the" poem!
- It's the jailhouse poem, all right, man?

46:44.168 --> 46:46.697
- Some'ing we all wrote.
- Excuse me, sorry...

46:49.103 --> 46:52.764
"When we're in a sober mood
We worry, work and think,

46:53.436 --> 46:57.216
"When we're in a drunken mood
We gamble, play and drink.

46:57.687 --> 47:01.218
"But when our moods are over
When our time has come to pass

47:01.834 --> 47:07.096
"We hope they bury us upside down
So the warden can kiss our ass!"

47:07.097 --> 47:08.937
- Amen!
- I like that.

47:08.938 --> 47:10.523
- You like that, huh?
- It's a little catchy.

47:13.041 --> 47:13.955
Raunchy!

47:14.145 --> 47:16.765
This is the best.
I mean, this... this is good, man.

47:17.729 --> 47:20.218
- What's wrong, man?
- Nothing.

47:20.688 --> 47:21.303
It's good.

47:21.771 --> 47:22.943
I wouldn't smoke around this.

47:23.265 --> 47:26.716
But it tastes as good as
any dollar wine I've ever had.

47:26.751 --> 47:28.621
Check, please!

47:30.063 --> 47:32.442
Wait, wait, wait!
"When my moods are over,

47:32.626 --> 47:35.431
"And my time..." That's not it.
Wait, wait. "... time has come..."

47:35.431 --> 47:36.852
Take five, man.

47:37.397 --> 47:38.994
You married,
or thinkin' about it, or what?

47:38.994 --> 47:40.506
Look, if you don't
wanna talk about it...

47:40.731 --> 47:44.104
Are you proposing to me?
You're not my type.

47:44.104 --> 47:45.692
- No, I'm not married.
- Not married?

47:45.692 --> 47:46.608
No.

47:46.608 --> 47:48.353
You planning on gettin' married
when you get outta here?

47:48.353 --> 47:51.185
Oh, yeah,
that's the plan. Yeah.

47:52.982 --> 47:57.044
- You know, I had this really nice girl.
- Yeah?

47:57.522 --> 48:00.189
She was nice.
And we were in love.

48:00.730 --> 48:03.172
And we started talkin' about,
you know, gettin' married and...

48:03.172 --> 48:03.511
Yeah.

48:03.724 --> 48:07.507
She's got three brothers, like,
about 1% percent retarded, these guys.

48:08.231 --> 48:12.690
- They-they throw a beatin' on me.
- Some guys don't appreciate romance.

48:12.690 --> 48:14.966
- Yeah.
- Don't take it personally.

48:16.181 --> 48:19.860
She wrote me for a while.
Then it just stopped.

48:20.817 --> 48:22.357
That's when it hit me, Frank.

48:22.357 --> 48:25.771
I ain't ever gonna be with a girl again
or even see a real one.

48:26.232 --> 48:29.712
I'm gonna end up like Eclipse,
kissing pictures in magazines, man.

48:30.983 --> 48:33.665
You know, there's
so many things I ain't never done!

48:33.665 --> 48:36.389
I ain't never learned
how to drive a car, Frank.

48:36.706 --> 48:37.832
What?

48:37.867 --> 48:40.335
I ain't never learned
how to drive a car.

48:43.899 --> 48:47.731
I hope we don't get a speeding ticket.
I'd hate to end up in jail.

48:48.297 --> 48:51.322
You're supposed to be a wise guy.
You wanna learn to drive or not?

48:51.322 --> 48:52.937
This is the best I can do.

48:54.072 --> 48:57.797
Okay. Now cut it sharp.
That's it. All right. Look.

48:58.651 --> 49:00.236
Why don't you hang
a left on 42nd Street.

49:00.669 --> 49:03.316
Then we'll go down to Broadway
and check out the action, okay?

49:03.316 --> 49:06.019
What Broadway?
We're doin' circles in a garage.

49:06.019 --> 49:09.381
Aw, come on, First.
Work here with me, okay?

49:09.506 --> 49:11.117
You wanna stay here
or are you gonna

49:11.117 --> 49:12.587
end to Broadway
check out the action?

49:12.587 --> 49:14.649
I wanna check out the action,
of course.

49:14.649 --> 49:16.190
- Okay.
- All right.

49:16.190 --> 49:18.685
- Turn left on 42nd Street.
- Okay, I got it.

49:20.485 --> 49:23.536
The place is jumping.
Look at the action here!

49:23.536 --> 49:25.403
Check out
those fine-lookin' ladies!

49:25.875 --> 49:28.001
Yo, honey, wanna come
for a ride in my new car?

49:28.001 --> 49:30.359
- Hey, baby!
- Hey, Frank, they ain't responding.

49:30.359 --> 49:32.034
Don't worry about it,
they're not your type.

49:32.380 --> 49:33.970
When was the last time
you were in Atlantic City?

49:33.970 --> 49:35.418
Oh, man,
I've never been there.

49:35.418 --> 49:38.021
No? We're there now.
What do you think?

49:38.056 --> 49:40.393
I don't know. Do I like it?
What does it resemble?

49:40.393 --> 49:42.652
It's the best. Look around.
Look at the lights.

49:42.965 --> 49:45.995
The Boardwalk
is jumpin'... day and night.

49:46.569 --> 49:50.208
It's hot music. You got high rollers.
You got parties.

49:50.208 --> 49:50.664
Yeah.

49:50.664 --> 49:51.873
- You got money.
- Yeah!

49:51.874 --> 49:52.874
- You got gambling.
- Whoo!

49:52.875 --> 49:54.812
You got 10,000 chorus girls!

49:55.528 --> 49:59.046
Hey, baby, wanna come for a ride
in my new vehicle? Whoo!

49:59.804 --> 50:01.882
Oh, man.
Yo, that was great, man.

50:01.882 --> 50:05.682
I hate to tell you, your engine just blew
a rod. You're ready for Indianapolis, kid.

50:06.279 --> 50:07.740
You got the touch.

50:08.087 --> 50:10.348
Frank, let me ask you
one favor, man.

50:10.903 --> 50:12.708
I appreciate the drive
and everything, you know,

50:12.708 --> 50:17.146
but... none o' this is real unless
I can hear this engine kick over just once.

50:17.146 --> 50:18.694
First, you know,
if I turn the engine on,

50:18.694 --> 50:20.653
what's gonna happen is
the guards will come bustin' in here,

50:20.653 --> 50:22.470
they're gonna grab out
every one of us

50:22.470 --> 50:24.562
and they'll throw us
in the hole forever. Forget it.

50:25.113 --> 50:28.965
Come on, Frank. Just for 10 seconds.
It'll last for the rest of my life.

50:29.405 --> 50:31.795
You are such a pain
in the ass!

50:32.488 --> 50:37.560
Come on, Frank. Let me just
hear that engine. We built it, man.

50:41.239 --> 50:43.111
All right, go on.
10 seconds.

50:47.120 --> 50:51.192
Hey! Lookin' good!
Ain't that great, huh?

50:51.948 --> 50:55.274
- It's beautiful, baby.
- Hit it, one time!

50:55.990 --> 50:58.692
- All right, one more time!
- Damn it, Frank!

51:00.157 --> 51:03.078
Okay, turn it off.
You got it. You did it. Turn it off!

51:04.955 --> 51:09.045
- Hey, kill it, Frank. Come on, man.
- Come on, First. Turn it off.

51:10.324 --> 51:13.654
Frank, if I turn it off, I ain't never
gonna turn it on again, right, Frank?

51:14.532 --> 51:15.694
That's right.

51:16.532 --> 51:18.930
Please, turn it off, First.

51:19.648 --> 51:22.330
- First...
- I'm sorry, Frank.

51:22.788 --> 51:23.649
Oh, shit!

51:23.649 --> 51:25.919
Frank, turn it off
and get him out of that car.

51:26.343 --> 51:27.445
Get him out!

51:28.159 --> 51:29.525
Frank, get on that kid!

51:30.180 --> 51:31.648
Stop that kid!

51:36.604 --> 51:37.272
Look out!

51:53.023 --> 51:54.618
First! First!

51:55.034 --> 51:57.851
First, turn it off,
you crazy bastard!

52:02.868 --> 52:07.078
<i>All right, stop that car now.
I repeat: Stop that car!</i>

52:12.993 --> 52:15.146
They're gonna kill you!

52:20.410 --> 52:23.634
- This is Meissner. Stop firing!
- But, sir, the warden said...

52:23.634 --> 52:26.473
- Goddamn it, I said stop firing!
- Hold it, hold it.

52:29.619 --> 52:32.264
First, turn it off!
Hold it. Hold it.

52:33.453 --> 52:36.534
Frank, look out! Look out,
look out, Frank, look out, man!

52:36.994 --> 52:38.759
Get out of the car!

52:39.091 --> 52:41.404
Get out of the car!
They'll kill your ass.

52:41.462 --> 52:45.116
- Frank, did you see that ride, man?
- Sure I saw it. Are you crazy?

52:45.116 --> 52:46.709
- It's beautiful, man.
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

52:46.709 --> 52:48.823
I can drive, Frank.
Drive, Frank.

52:48.824 --> 52:51.698
All right, all right. You're one crazy
son of a bitch, you know that?

52:51.698 --> 52:52.895
Yeah!

52:55.371 --> 52:56.300
Move!

52:59.259 --> 53:02.737
- You bought yourself a trip to the hole.
- Leave Frank alone!

53:05.954 --> 53:09.976
Let's go, let's go. Break it up!
Break it up! Let's go.

53:09.976 --> 53:13.285
Let him go.
You have the wrong man.

53:14.413 --> 53:16.319
- Take Leone to the hole.
- Back off.

53:16.319 --> 53:19.087
- Six weeks.
- It's not his fault, sir, it was mine!

53:19.087 --> 53:20.253
Save it.

53:20.254 --> 53:21.680
Get off me!

53:23.902 --> 53:25.043
Captain?

53:26.246 --> 53:31.327
I want five inmates. Give me a bat.
I wanna break up this car.

53:31.327 --> 53:33.495
Hold it right there, now!

53:35.330 --> 53:37.603
I want you
to watch this, Leone.

54:47.626 --> 54:49.554
Back to
the honeymoon suite!

54:55.918 --> 54:57.467
Night.

55:01.085 --> 55:04.791
- You should've been notified...
- Why is he in isolation?

55:04.960 --> 55:07.343
- I don't have that information.
- Oh, you don't have that information?

55:07.343 --> 55:11.787
- Then I wanna see the goddamn warden!
- Not today.

55:13.084 --> 55:16.577
<i>Every hour when the light comes on,
you'll stand, face the camera,</i>

55:16.577 --> 55:18.258
<i>and state your name
and number.</i>

55:18.918 --> 55:22.165
<i>Name and number!
- Leone, 510.</i>

55:23.251 --> 55:26.617
<i>Face the camera!
Name and number!</i>

55:28.835 --> 55:30.635
Leone, 510.

55:42.503 --> 55:43.985
<i>Name and number!</i>

55:47.628 --> 55:48.955
Leone, 510.

55:55.837 --> 55:56.494
<i>Name and number!</i>

56:02.088 --> 56:05.034
Leone... 510.

56:12.296 --> 56:14.453
<i>On your feet!
Name and number!</i>

56:16.588 --> 56:19.954
Give Mr. Leone half rations
for the rest of his time here.

56:19.954 --> 56:20.730
Yes, sir.

56:21.769 --> 56:23.331
<i>Name and number!</i>

56:32.673 --> 56:33.525
<i>Get up!</i>

56:34.297 --> 56:38.338
He seems a little sluggish.
Wake him up!

56:47.256 --> 56:48.459
Cold enough?

57:00.340 --> 57:02.338
<i>- Wanna see my swing?
- I'd like to see you in whites.</i>

57:05.286 --> 57:07.388
<i>- Some swing.
- You see me on the golf course?</i>

57:08.628 --> 57:10.559
<i>You got
a little cruel streak in you.</i>

57:13.632 --> 57:15.191
<i>Leone, 510.</i>

57:17.757 --> 57:21.538
<i>Upright! Name and number!
- Leone, 510.</i>

57:28.383 --> 57:31.392
<i>You'll be praying for some time on
your own. You know that? You know that?</i>

57:31.392 --> 57:36.145
<i>- I don't believe that.
- Trust me. I know about these things.</i>

57:37.550 --> 57:39.833
<i>Leone, 510.</i>

57:40.092 --> 57:41.412
<i>Water!</i>

57:49.842 --> 57:51.420
<i>Leone, 510.</i>

57:55.718 --> 57:57.708
<i>Name and number!</i>

57:58.176 --> 58:00.499
<i>Marilyn... Monroe.</i>

58:00.967 --> 58:04.049
<i>37... something.</i>

58:05.218 --> 58:06.759
<i>35.</i>

58:16.052 --> 58:18.209
Crack 121!

58:22.678 --> 58:26.588
Listen, I didn't mean it.
No, I didn't say anything at all. No!

58:40.095 --> 58:41.342
That's enough.

58:57.595 --> 58:59.716
- Who ordered this?
- The warden.

59:00.178 --> 59:04.674
Does the warden hate 'im enough
to kill 'im? Cause that ain't my job!

59:05.221 --> 59:09.078
Mr. Sensitive. He's upset, he thinks
we're treatin' Leone too rough.

59:09.762 --> 59:11.811
Forget which are the cops
and which are the cons?

59:11.812 --> 59:12.778
Whose side are you on?

59:12.778 --> 59:15.941
- You want me? Come on!
- Break it up!

59:23.805 --> 59:25.837
Your stick, Mr. Braden.

59:31.723 --> 59:32.240
Pussy.

59:32.240 --> 59:34.173
And you, you get
the hell outta my sight,

59:34.173 --> 59:36.376
before I shine
my boots with your face,

59:36.376 --> 59:39.525
you fat piece of shit!
Go on!

59:52.015 --> 59:53.441
Time's up.

01:00:14.432 --> 01:00:16.698
Remember
what I told you, Frank.

01:00:17.516 --> 01:00:21.780
Roll with the system. Roll with it
or it's only gonna get harder.

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:29.572
Yeah, and it's getting
shorter too.

01:00:47.172 --> 01:00:53.814
So, what's new, Mr. Braden?
Hmm. How's the family? Good?

01:00:56.226 --> 01:01:01.843
- How're the Jets doin'?
- Don't forget to check your bed!

01:01:58.771 --> 01:02:00.394
Hey, Frank!

01:02:01.563 --> 01:02:03.457
Somebody die in here?

01:02:04.688 --> 01:02:07.345
Ain't a great
welcome home, is it?

01:02:18.939 --> 01:02:20.528
Hey, big man.

01:02:21.271 --> 01:02:25.266
Sand. The whole engine block
is full of it. It was Chink.

01:02:26.445 --> 01:02:28.597
What are we gonna do
about this?

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.931
- Forget it.
- Forget it?

01:02:31.932 --> 01:02:36.238
We poured everything we got into this
car. No way we can let Chink slide.

01:02:36.273 --> 01:02:39.170
- Let it go, First Base.
- Let it go?!

01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:42.716
Aren't you the guys who says
you gotta protect what's yours,

01:02:42.716 --> 01:02:46.972
watch each other's back,
you watch mine, I watch yours?

01:02:46.981 --> 01:02:49.705
I guess that was nothin'
but a bunch of jive, huh, Frank,

01:02:49.705 --> 01:02:51.424
now that you're a short-timer.

01:02:51.459 --> 01:02:56.216
You're incredible! What?
You think this is your car?

01:02:56.216 --> 01:02:59.224
This ain't your car.
This is the warden's car!

01:02:59.574 --> 01:03:02.569
What do you think, that...
do you think that Chink Weber did this?

01:03:03.232 --> 01:03:06.678
Drumgoole did this.
Come on. What?

01:03:06.678 --> 01:03:08.390
You think that
we got this car together,

01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:10.428
that we were gonna
take our dates out in it?

01:03:10.428 --> 01:03:11.656
Is that what you thought?

01:03:11.656 --> 01:03:13.134
Maybe rotate it
on weekends?

01:03:13.241 --> 01:03:15.068
Hey, Ernie, why don't you
take it Friday?

01:03:15.068 --> 01:03:17.022
And Dallas, why don't you
take it Saturday?

01:03:17.022 --> 01:03:21.303
And Eclipse, you got it Sunday!
Is that what you thought? Huh?

01:03:21.649 --> 01:03:25.727
It's his! This lift is his, these
tools are his, the garage is his!

01:03:26.192 --> 01:03:28.987
The whole goddamn place is his!

01:03:29.817 --> 01:03:33.107
And you better remember that too,
because once you start buyin' into this...

01:03:33.107 --> 01:03:38.384
"our car", "our thing" concept,
man, you're his too!

01:03:46.818 --> 01:03:49.276
Just let it go.

01:03:50.985 --> 01:03:52.818
Where you goin'?
I thought you were our leader.

01:03:52.818 --> 01:03:54.984
Goddamn it,
I'm not your leader!

01:03:54.984 --> 01:03:58.264
And this ain't a gang!
We're convicts!

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.796
We're prisoners! We're inmates!
We're here.

01:04:00.796 --> 01:04:03.342
And as long as we're here,
we're gonna stay his.

01:04:04.291 --> 01:04:11.965
We're his. Nothing's ever change that.
You gotta face the facts.

01:04:12.959 --> 01:04:15.605
Now, you guys are standup,
no doubt about it.

01:04:16.611 --> 01:04:20.707
But I got three weeks to get outta
here. And in three weeks, I'm walkin'.

01:04:21.861 --> 01:04:25.142
Ain't nothin'
gonna change that. I...

01:04:26.402 --> 01:04:28.689
That's all I care about.

01:04:38.612 --> 01:04:42.368
That's nothin' for nothin', man.
He's right.

01:04:54.321 --> 01:04:57.490
Hey, Leone, how do you like
my belt buckle, boy?

01:04:57.939 --> 01:05:02.343
Yeah, I know. I like it too.
A little souvenir that reminds me of you.

01:05:03.696 --> 01:05:07.147
Tell me, what are you
gonna do about it?

01:05:10.863 --> 01:05:16.918
You mean six weeks in the hole
killed your guts and your appetite?

01:05:19.822 --> 01:05:23.376
It ain't over,
you son of a bitch.

01:05:35.740 --> 01:05:40.332
- Anybody call this spot?
- Naw, you guys don't need reservations.

01:05:40.456 --> 01:05:44.268
- Hey, you on a diet, Frank? Huh, man?
- Cutting back a little bit.

01:05:46.115 --> 01:05:47.897
Hey, Frank, take
some of my food, buddy.

01:05:47.897 --> 01:05:49.836
Yeah, here you go, Frank.
Don't worry about it.

01:05:49.836 --> 01:05:51.224
- Some bread...
- That's nice.

01:05:51.224 --> 01:05:53.886
Tomatoes, man.
You'll be all right. Celery stick.

01:05:54.033 --> 01:05:57.433
- I ain't playin' football!
- Hey, Frank, don't worry about that guy.

01:05:57.433 --> 01:06:00.856
We gotta fight him for. He's a lifer.
You only got a few weeks to go.

01:06:00.856 --> 01:06:02.408
Forget about 'im.

01:06:02.899 --> 01:06:06.287
I think a miracle just happened.
First Base finally learned something.

01:06:06.288 --> 01:06:06.866
I doubt it.

01:06:08.657 --> 01:06:11.503
- Okay, who's gonna say grace, huh?
- Grace!

01:06:11.504 --> 01:06:12.962
She was terrific,
wasn't she?

01:06:15.324 --> 01:06:18.654
- I thought I could rely on you, Weber.
- He won't be pushed.

01:06:19.116 --> 01:06:22.063
Because you're
not pushing in the right place.

01:06:22.699 --> 01:06:24.646
Everyone has a weak spot, Weber.

01:06:25.696 --> 01:06:30.858
Find his, or I'll have
to find a new yard boss.

01:06:33.992 --> 01:06:35.645
Welcome to the Gateway Stakes.

01:06:35.645 --> 01:06:37.396
Come on, guys, I'm startin' to feel
like a steamed vegetable.

01:06:37.396 --> 01:06:38.090
Let's start the race.

01:06:38.090 --> 01:06:39.971
All right, all right. Hey, Frank, Frank,
what's your bug's name, man?

01:06:39.971 --> 01:06:42.949
- Uhh, Dirt Creature.
- Dirt Creature. 3-to-2 on Dirt Creature.

01:06:43.409 --> 01:06:45.020
- First Base, what's your bug's name, ma?
- Rear Entry.

01:06:45.020 --> 01:06:47.784
Rear Entry's 4-to-5.
Place your bets.

01:06:47.784 --> 01:06:49.236
Two'll get you three,
five'll get you four.

01:06:49.236 --> 01:06:52.097
Two'll get you three, five'll get
you four Five'll get you four.

01:06:55.012 --> 01:06:56.585
Everything I got
on Dirt Creature!

01:06:57.202 --> 01:06:59.710
I bet the house on Rear Entry.

01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:03.746
Window is closed. All bets are in.
Gentlemen, start your insects.

01:07:04.692 --> 01:07:07.129
- All right!
- Come on, Dirt!

01:07:07.487 --> 01:07:08.750
Boom! They're off.

01:07:11.892 --> 01:07:14.130
I've got a steak dinner
on this victory, buddy boy!

01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:15.725
Come on, Dirt. Come on.

01:07:19.448 --> 01:07:22.034
- You can't do that!
- That's it, we got a steward's inquiry.

01:07:22.495 --> 01:07:24.201
You can't push your bug
across the line like that!

01:07:24.201 --> 01:07:26.725
A come-from-behind
victory by Rear Entry!

01:07:27.204 --> 01:07:29.403
- We need to re-run the race.
- Hey, no rematch.

01:07:29.487 --> 01:07:31.635
Hey! What are you guys
doin' down there?

01:07:31.635 --> 01:07:32.514
Shit.

01:07:34.287 --> 01:07:39.016
Peña! You're on the wrong detail.
Get your ass up here.

01:07:39.016 --> 01:07:40.941
I want you
to clean up the gym!

01:07:40.941 --> 01:07:43.593
- We got a rematch later, all right, buddy?
- Oh, yeah, sure we got.

01:07:44.454 --> 01:07:46.886
I'm gettin' outta here, man.
All bets are off. I'll pay up later.

01:07:46.887 --> 01:07:48.700
Now, asshole!

01:07:48.851 --> 01:07:50.128
Hey, gimme a break, man.

01:07:50.128 --> 01:07:52.675
I gotta get dressed over here,
you know what I mean?

01:07:53.198 --> 01:07:55.037
Hey, watch out for my bug!

01:07:55.037 --> 01:07:59.014
I'll take care of him
for you. Really. Delicious.

01:07:59.037 --> 01:08:01.737
- Come on, let's do it today!
- All right.

01:08:21.122 --> 01:08:23.872
- Clean this place up.
- It's already cleaned.

01:08:23.872 --> 01:08:26.386
- What are you, deaf?
- Shut your mouth and do it.

01:10:13.503 --> 01:10:15.534
Come on.
One by one, come on!

01:10:17.787 --> 01:10:18.587
Come on!

01:10:23.050 --> 01:10:24.235
Get him down there.

01:10:33.984 --> 01:10:35.169
Hold his head!

01:10:39.629 --> 01:10:42.392
I told you we'd play later,
you little bitch.

01:10:54.871 --> 01:10:56.023
Hey, Leone!

01:10:57.255 --> 01:10:59.133
- They got First!
- I can't hear you!

01:11:02.838 --> 01:11:06.180
- What did you say?
- They got First Base in the gym.

01:11:07.797 --> 01:11:10.961
- What is it?
- They got First Base in the gym.

01:11:26.755 --> 01:11:27.585
First!

01:11:32.964 --> 01:11:34.232
Let me have it!

01:11:57.549 --> 01:11:59.261
Twenty years old.

01:12:00.216 --> 01:12:03.725
This kid's twenty years old.
I told you.

01:12:06.174 --> 01:12:08.916
I know. I know.

01:12:17.967 --> 01:12:20.536
You want me, you got me.

01:12:21.384 --> 01:12:24.086
You want me, fucking Nazi.

01:12:24.634 --> 01:12:27.695
You want me... you got me!

01:12:55.969 --> 01:12:56.964
No.

01:13:03.303 --> 01:13:05.047
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

01:13:05.594 --> 01:13:07.053
Fight! Fight!

01:13:42.096 --> 01:13:43.257
Kick his ass!

01:13:56.555 --> 01:13:57.919
I'll kill you!

01:13:59.805 --> 01:14:00.967
Son of a bitch!

01:14:02.305 --> 01:14:03.642
I'll kill you!

01:14:43.391 --> 01:14:45.132
Do it!

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:47.008
Pussy face!

01:14:51.391 --> 01:14:53.682
Do it! Take him down!

01:15:37.018 --> 01:15:39.840
Linen run!
Come on, get a move on.

01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:41.834
I'm tryin' to make a livin' here,
you know what I'm sayin'?

01:15:42.342 --> 01:15:47.815
Hey, hey, hey. Frank. My man.
Florence Nightingale...

01:15:48.768 --> 01:15:51.347
- How you feelin'?
- All right.

01:15:51.347 --> 01:15:53.727
Yeah? Three weeks
you're out of this joint, man.

01:15:53.727 --> 01:15:55.669
Feels like three years.

01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:58.092
Oh, come on, man.
Three weeks is a blink.

01:16:01.269 --> 01:16:03.066
What'd they do
with the kid?

01:16:06.478 --> 01:16:07.992
They sent 'im home, man,
what do you think?

01:16:08.556 --> 01:16:10.148
You know...

01:16:12.323 --> 01:16:18.355
You know... Ugh. The kid told me once.
Uh... The body has to be in prison,

01:16:18.355 --> 01:16:21.616
but your mind can be
wherever it wants. You know?

01:16:23.103 --> 01:16:27.560
- He tell you that?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:16:29.021 --> 01:16:31.920
Listen, Frank, I brought you...
I brought you some toilet paper, man,

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:34.007
in case, um, um,
in case, you know,

01:16:34.007 --> 01:16:36.557
you wanna write some poetry
or something, you know?

01:16:37.515 --> 01:16:41.184
Hey, hey, hey, colonel Klink.
Lemme outta here, man.

01:16:46.855 --> 01:16:49.224
Hey, Frank, man,
it wasn't your fault, okay?

01:16:49.687 --> 01:16:51.602
Remember that.

01:17:00.271 --> 01:17:04.987
Roberta, have Miss Lowell photographed
for an I.D. for visitation.

01:17:05.563 --> 01:17:07.687
I'm reinstating
Mr. Leone's privileges.

01:17:07.687 --> 01:17:08.694
Yes, sir.

01:17:09.606 --> 01:17:14.346
- I just wanna make sure Frank's all right.
- Oh, he's fine. He's recovering nicely.

01:17:14.814 --> 01:17:16.325
And in three weeks
he'll be out of here,

01:17:16.325 --> 01:17:18.812
and you can look forward
to a happy life together.

01:17:19.313 --> 01:17:22.453
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you, warden.

01:17:28.856 --> 01:17:30.582
Okay, look into the light.

01:17:39.565 --> 01:17:41.805
- Hi, baby!
- Hi!

01:17:43.441 --> 01:17:44.761
How are you?

01:17:46.316 --> 01:17:48.556
- I was so worried about you.
- You look great!

01:17:49.024 --> 01:17:51.595
Thirty-minute visit, Leone.
Compliments of the warden.

01:17:52.065 --> 01:17:54.104
- Don't waste it.
- How do you feel?

01:17:54.566 --> 01:17:56.860
Oh, I feel pretty good.
Thanks, sweetheart.

01:17:57.138 --> 01:18:01.599
Thirty minutes. You need any help...
just give us a call, huh?

01:18:06.442 --> 01:18:10.667
- They all like that?
- Don't worry about it. You look great.

01:18:10.668 --> 01:18:11.666
You look...

01:18:12.192 --> 01:18:14.643
Don't tell me what I look like.
I can't stand it.

01:18:15.609 --> 01:18:17.672
I've missed you so much!

01:18:26.984 --> 01:18:30.702
No more separations.
Promise?

01:18:31.193 --> 01:18:32.852
I promise.

01:18:50.568 --> 01:18:53.218
- Time's up!
- Ooh, nice view.

01:18:53.218 --> 01:18:55.732
- What the hell's the matter with you?
- You heard. Time's up.

01:18:55.902 --> 01:18:59.315
- The warden said half an hour.
- Well, the warden changed his mind.

01:19:00.444 --> 01:19:03.429
What do you mean he changed his mind?
I wanna talk to the warden!

01:19:03.429 --> 01:19:06.298
Lady, what you wanna do
is keep your mouth shut.

01:19:06.298 --> 01:19:09.772
Fix your clothes
and get out. Come on!

01:19:09.861 --> 01:19:12.913
- Don't touch her!
- What did you say?

01:19:13.734 --> 01:19:16.319
"Don't touch her?"
You don't learn, do you, pal.

01:19:16.319 --> 01:19:17.891
Hey, hey, I'm leaving.

01:19:23.445 --> 01:19:25.895
Three weeks, three weeks,
three weeks.

01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:57.339
Leone! Come here!

01:20:04.447 --> 01:20:05.869
Do I know you?

01:20:06.103 --> 01:20:09.229
No, you don't know me, Frank,
but I know you.

01:20:09.413 --> 01:20:10.946
I was at Treadmore with you.

01:20:14.031 --> 01:20:18.892
- A-Block.
- Treadmore don't have an A-Block.

01:20:18.990 --> 01:20:21.823
- That's right.
- We got somethin' else in common.

01:20:22.282 --> 01:20:26.066
- Yeah? What's that?
- We're both gettin' out soon.

01:20:26.531 --> 01:20:30.148
You in a few weeks.
Me, I'm gone the day after tomorrow.

01:20:31.947 --> 01:20:35.979
- What happened to you?
- One beating too many.

01:20:37.116 --> 01:20:40.977
I served some hard time in this place.
We both have, am I right?

01:20:43.461 --> 01:20:46.922
Yeah. You're right
about that.

01:20:46.922 --> 01:20:49.913
Hey, you need anything when
I get out? Can I get you anything?

01:20:51.491 --> 01:20:55.523
- No, I'm all right, thanks.
- I'm just lucky, I guess.

01:20:56.366 --> 01:20:57.907
I got a job lined up
when I get out.

01:20:57.907 --> 01:21:02.095
It's just temporary, you know, but
it pays a grand for two hours of work.

01:21:02.534 --> 01:21:05.650
- It's not bad, eh?
- What do you gotta do?

01:21:09.158 --> 01:21:14.208
I just gotta... rape this bitch. I get an
extra hundred every time she screams.

01:21:14.243 --> 01:21:17.816
- I'll kill you for that! I'll kill you!
- Payback time, Frank.

01:21:17.851 --> 01:21:19.174
Chink says hello.

01:21:19.174 --> 01:21:20.402
You touch her,
you're dead!

01:21:20.402 --> 01:21:23.454
Hey, bailiff! Guard!
Guard! Somebody!

01:21:23.454 --> 01:21:27.166
Manly! Hey, Manly! Guard!

01:21:28.284 --> 01:21:30.489
- What's your problem, Leone?
- I gotta use the phone now.

01:21:30.951 --> 01:21:32.600
You know your privileges.
No phone.

01:21:32.600 --> 01:21:33.768
Manly, please, that guy....

01:21:33.768 --> 01:21:36.359
That guy in the wheelchair, it's
an emergency. He's gonna kill my girlfriend.

01:21:36.359 --> 01:21:37.114
What guy?

01:21:37.416 --> 01:21:39.706
The guy that was just here!
You let him in! He got in a wheelchair!

01:21:39.706 --> 01:21:42.146
- I've gotta warn 'er!
- I see is an empty wheelchair.

01:21:42.146 --> 01:21:44.624
- What are you tryin' to pull, Leone?
- Fuck, don't play with me, Manly.

01:21:44.659 --> 01:21:47.262
Please. I gotta use the phone.
I gotta warn her!

01:21:47.262 --> 01:21:51.283
Everybody's got problems, Leone.
Get some sleep.

01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:55.190
Goddamn, you fat motherfucker!
Goddamn!

01:22:01.078 --> 01:22:04.853
Hey, Frank. Doin' some
spring-cleaning, huh, man?

01:22:06.453 --> 01:22:09.000
Dallas! Come here!

01:22:14.203 --> 01:22:17.417
- What is it, man?
- I need some help.

01:22:18.286 --> 01:22:20.023
No questions asked.

01:22:22.662 --> 01:22:24.200
What, you're bustin' out, man?

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.801
What the hell's goin' on, you got
less than three weeks to go!

01:22:26.836 --> 01:22:27.881
Just help me.

01:22:27.881 --> 01:22:30.346
Hey, if that's what you need,
it's gonna take a couple o' days, okay?

01:22:30.346 --> 01:22:32.581
- No, I need it tonight.
- Tonight I can't do that, man.

01:22:32.581 --> 01:22:35.128
By the time I finish tonight,
everything is gonna be locked up!

01:22:35.128 --> 01:22:36.239
Listen to me!

01:22:36.482 --> 01:22:38.367
There's a con gettin'
out of here tomorrow.

01:22:38.604 --> 01:22:40.973
Chink Weber's paid him off
to get Melissa. You understand?

01:22:40.973 --> 01:22:43.227
Yeah, I understand, Frank.
I'd love to help,

01:22:43.227 --> 01:22:46.200
but I can't do the impossible.
You're hurtin' my arm, man.

01:22:53.705 --> 01:22:55.411
I'll take you with me.

01:22:58.330 --> 01:22:59.958
No shit?

01:23:01.539 --> 01:23:04.158
- What's the plan?
- You'll know when you gotta know.

01:23:06.040 --> 01:23:08.180
Goin' for the tunnels,
huh, man?

01:23:10.331 --> 01:23:11.952
You just be here,
all right?

01:23:13.410 --> 01:23:15.526
Hey, convict, move it
outta there! Let's go!

01:23:15.526 --> 01:23:18.173
Hey, use some bleach on that,
Frank, better get those stains out.

01:23:18.173 --> 01:23:20.457
I'm coming outta here,
colonel Klink.

01:23:24.665 --> 01:23:27.514
Linen run. Evening, officer Vazquez.
What's happenin'?

01:23:27.514 --> 01:23:29.427
You're late. Shit!
Now get in on, come on.

01:23:29.427 --> 01:23:31.152
- Yes, siree.
- Quick.

01:23:31.153 --> 01:23:34.250
- I'll be real quick, sir.
- Still makin' that jailhouse booze?

01:23:34.250 --> 01:23:36.703
Absolutely not, sir.
I'm on the wagon.

01:23:36.703 --> 01:23:38.936
I just joined Alcoholics Unanimous,
you know?

01:23:38.936 --> 01:23:42.101
- Whatever. You got some line of shit.
- It's bad on my nervous system.

01:23:42.101 --> 01:23:43.746
Makes me talk too much,
you know what I mean?

01:23:44.124 --> 01:23:47.372
- Make it quick.
- Yeah, I'll be right out, sir. Right out.

01:23:55.875 --> 01:23:58.281
No! Help!

01:24:04.708 --> 01:24:06.509
Come on. Frank, let's go, man!
Come on!

01:24:06.510 --> 01:24:08.174
Okay, come on. That's it.

01:24:12.122 --> 01:24:15.838
All right. We got 10 minutes.
All right, move it.

01:24:15.838 --> 01:24:17.742
Sweet dreams, Moby Dick!

01:24:18.456 --> 01:24:20.243
- Frank?
- Come on. Come on, come on!

01:24:20.243 --> 01:24:21.402
Tools, man.

01:24:36.085 --> 01:24:37.568
You got it.

01:24:39.602 --> 01:24:44.250
Okay, here I go.
Oh, God, I'm jumpin'!

01:24:47.752 --> 01:24:50.458
Aw, man,
there's rats in here, Frank.

01:25:01.017 --> 01:25:01.677
Come on!

01:25:01.677 --> 01:25:04.299
- All right. I'm all right. No! No, no.
- What?

01:25:04.503 --> 01:25:06.603
It's this way, man.
It's a shortcut to the steam plant.

01:25:07.035 --> 01:25:07.970
It's this way!

01:25:07.970 --> 01:25:09.513
No, man,
I remember the map.

01:25:09.513 --> 01:25:12.664
It's this way. I'm positive, man.
I'm positive. Let's go!

01:25:31.297 --> 01:25:33.002
D.T.A., Frank.

01:25:34.921 --> 01:25:38.425
Ain't that what
you taught me, man? D.T.A.

01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:40.633
Right on schedule,
Frank.

01:25:41.097 --> 01:25:44.157
I'm sorry, man. You were
my ticket outta here. I'm sorry.

01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:46.268
Damn you, Dallas!

01:25:50.130 --> 01:25:54.254
You... had me... set up...
the whole time?!

01:25:54.713 --> 01:26:00.154
Not the whole time.
I got 30 years to go, man. 30 years.

01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:02.791
The warden made me a deal.

01:26:04.589 --> 01:26:06.496
Dumb... dumb bastard!

01:26:06.964 --> 01:26:09.388
They made me a deal, man!
A deal!

01:26:09.388 --> 01:26:12.958
We don't make deals
with escaping prisoners.

01:26:17.064 --> 01:26:19.624
What are you talking about, man?
You said if I delivered...

01:26:19.624 --> 01:26:20.549
Shut up.

01:26:21.086 --> 01:26:24.214
- You're going back to the population.
- Population?

01:26:24.819 --> 01:26:28.610
Oh, you can't do this to me, warden.
You can't do this to me, man.

01:26:28.610 --> 01:26:31.450
I snitched him off. They're gonna
kill me back there. I'm finished.

01:26:31.549 --> 01:26:32.780
Tough.

01:26:33.758 --> 01:26:37.205
All right, look, I came through,
goddamn it! We had a deal!

01:26:39.882 --> 01:26:41.844
That's enough.
You're gonna kill 'im.

01:26:44.007 --> 01:26:45.746
That's enough!

01:26:51.967 --> 01:26:54.301
This is an automatic
10 years, Frank.

01:26:54.777 --> 01:26:57.754
It's 10 ten years
for a second escape attempt.

01:26:58.333 --> 01:26:59.340
I knew you'd cross the line.

01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:02.435
I told them 5 years ago
you were a hardcore criminal.

01:27:02.435 --> 01:27:06.760
But they'll believe me now.
And you better believe me.

01:27:06.967 --> 01:27:10.099
You better believe that
you're gonna be doing hard time here...

01:27:10.538 --> 01:27:12.430
for the rest of your life.

01:27:14.510 --> 01:27:16.671
Manly,
you know what to do.

01:27:29.802 --> 01:27:31.425
Some deal maker.

01:27:40.801 --> 01:27:44.247
See? Shit does float,
doesn't it?

01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:46.393
Hey, you know what else?

01:27:46.969 --> 01:27:48.532
You don't have to worry
about that psycho hurtin'

01:27:48.532 --> 01:27:51.000
that pretty little blonde
bitch girlfriend of yours.

01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:55.384
We decided to keep him in here.
Didn't we, officer?

01:28:02.636 --> 01:28:04.711
She's not my type.

01:28:08.511 --> 01:28:12.002
We'll teach him a lesson.
We'll graduate you with honours, pal.

01:28:12.012 --> 01:28:13.953
Come on,
turn on the steam, Mastrone!

01:28:13.954 --> 01:28:15.694
Turn on the fucking steam!

01:28:16.220 --> 01:28:17.769
Put him in it!

01:28:18.164 --> 01:28:19.462
Get him in there!

01:28:25.644 --> 01:28:28.190
Bring him in here!
Come on!

01:28:29.054 --> 01:28:31.312
Push him, Darrell! Do it!

01:28:34.430 --> 01:28:35.592
Come on!

01:28:45.055 --> 01:28:46.669
Rape this!

01:28:49.471 --> 01:28:54.550
Oh, my face! My face is burnin'!
My face!

01:29:37.183 --> 01:29:39.532
School's out, punk!

01:30:38.488 --> 01:30:44.907
Frank! Frank,
don't leave me here, man.

01:30:52.686 --> 01:30:57.139
I'm sorry.
Take me with you!

01:31:17.562 --> 01:31:21.500
Let him go, Manly!
Let him go!

01:31:30.396 --> 01:31:34.437
- What are you gonna do with that?
- You okay, Frank?

01:31:34.938 --> 01:31:36.765
I'm okay, Dallas.

01:31:37.688 --> 01:31:40.530
You can trust me, Frank.
You can trust me.

01:31:41.355 --> 01:31:43.799
- Put it down, Dallas.
- Put it down.

01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:47.702
- I won't hurt you anymore.
- Oh, yeah?

01:31:49.980 --> 01:31:53.678
- You don't wanna do it.
- You fat piece of shit.

01:31:54.147 --> 01:31:57.596
- Don't do it, Dallas!
- What, are you trying to scare me?

01:31:58.064 --> 01:31:59.378
Dallas, no!

01:32:01.397 --> 01:32:04.165
- You won't do it!
- Oh, yeah?

01:32:04.606 --> 01:32:08.885
- You don't got the balls to do it, punk.
- You're wrong.

01:32:08.885 --> 01:32:11.374
- Stoolie!
- You're wrong!

01:32:11.374 --> 01:32:12.776
- Dallas!
- Put it down!

01:32:12.776 --> 01:32:14.715
- Dallas, no!
- You're wrong!

01:32:34.232 --> 01:32:38.330
Switch to backup! Excuse me, sir,
we got a power outage in C-Wing.

01:32:38.942 --> 01:32:41.052
Get some men down
to that utility quarter.

01:33:04.775 --> 01:33:06.746
You better have
a real good reason

01:33:06.746 --> 01:33:09.082
for not telling me
you knew Leone was goin' out.

01:33:09.082 --> 01:33:11.512
I've got a dead officer and
a dead inmate out there.

01:33:12.239 --> 01:33:14.390
And I don't have
any fuckin' answers. Do you?

01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:17.856
I was trying to save an informant's
life by keeping an operation secret.

01:33:18.318 --> 01:33:20.430
Why the hell would a man
who's got less than three weeks to go

01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:23.223
try to break out
and kill two men? Why?

01:33:23.223 --> 01:33:26.151
We can ask him...
when we catch him.

01:33:45.778 --> 01:33:49.743
Busted cable... utility corridor.
He's going to the roof.

01:35:21.115 --> 01:35:22.865
Bring up Zone 2!

01:35:23.907 --> 01:35:25.843
Can't you get
any more light in there?

01:35:25.844 --> 01:35:27.218
<i>- Captain Meissner.
Meissner.</i>

01:35:27.533 --> 01:35:29.599
This is Osner.
I'm in the well room right now.

01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:31.386
Looks like this is
where he went out.

01:35:42.812 --> 01:35:46.004
Sir, that has got to be at least
200 yards underwater.

01:35:46.005 --> 01:35:49.290
- Do you really think he made it?
- Well, maybe not, Mr. Braden.

01:35:49.325 --> 01:35:52.011
But until you bring me a body,
I got an escaped prisoner.

01:35:52.011 --> 01:35:55.416
<i>This is Drumgoole. I want Sector 4.
- Meissner, Sector 4, go.</i>

01:35:55.450 --> 01:35:58.449
<i>- What do you have, Mr. Meissner?
- Right now, nothing, sir.</i>

01:35:58.909 --> 01:36:01.463
In fact, I'm thinking of calling in
the local and state police

01:36:01.463 --> 01:36:02.633
to coordinate with my men.

01:36:02.817 --> 01:36:07.220
No! No outside agencies.
I repeat, no outside agencies.

01:36:07.490 --> 01:36:10.961
This is an internal matter.
He's alive, I want 'im.

01:36:11.268 --> 01:36:14.318
Arm a tactical squad and
meet me in my office now.

01:36:14.318 --> 01:36:15.413
Yes, sir.

01:36:16.451 --> 01:36:19.512
Mr. Braden,
you will continue the search!

01:36:42.868 --> 01:36:48.557
You won't get away with it.
You know that, don't you?

01:36:50.203 --> 01:36:52.209
I could've got out.

01:36:54.328 --> 01:37:01.238
But I'm not gonna spend
my life running... from you.

01:37:05.662 --> 01:37:07.324
Paul, look at this!

01:37:10.537 --> 01:37:14.282
Get your ass.
Whoa, hold it! Hold it!

01:37:15.413 --> 01:37:18.727
- You can't use me as a hostage...
- Shut up! Shut up!

01:37:18.728 --> 01:37:21.005
You recognize that chair? Huh?

01:37:22.079 --> 01:37:25.776
You built it, didn't you?
Now get in there. Get in there!

01:37:26.247 --> 01:37:28.620
Don't even think
about movin'.

01:37:31.704 --> 01:37:33.041
Think you'll take me
to hell, huh?

01:37:33.041 --> 01:37:35.605
You'll be in no time there.
I'll show you hell!

01:37:40.914 --> 01:37:41.979
Move you leg!

01:37:42.811 --> 01:37:47.666
Dallas... he fried, the way
you're gonna fry. Huh?

01:37:48.375 --> 01:37:55.154
First Base, took him downstairs,
you broke his goddamn neck! Huh?

01:37:56.915 --> 01:38:01.162
I'm gonna fry your brains.
What do you know? It's a perfect fit.

01:38:05.498 --> 01:38:07.168
You can't make
this work, Frank.

01:38:07.168 --> 01:38:10.088
You're not smart enough.
You're too stupid.

01:38:10.124 --> 01:38:14.383
- You're scum!
- Shut up! I'll show you scum!

01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:20.143
You can't kill a man, Frank. You're not
a murderer. You don't have the guts.

01:38:25.666 --> 01:38:28.546
Ten more years.
Isn't that what you said?

01:38:29.332 --> 01:38:30.902
How about 20?

01:38:31.583 --> 01:38:32.910
How about 30?

01:38:33.374 --> 01:38:37.781
No, it doesn't matter what they give
me because you won't be satisfied...

01:38:38.264 --> 01:38:39.934
till you got me for life.

01:38:39.969 --> 01:38:41.341
Make a hole!

01:38:41.845 --> 01:38:43.203
Take it down!

01:38:45.853 --> 01:38:48.071
Well, I ain't doin' life
for nothin'!

01:38:49.375 --> 01:38:51.200
Come on.
Lean on it, man! Lean on it!

01:38:51.667 --> 01:38:53.568
They're gonna
break that door down, Frank.

01:38:53.568 --> 01:38:57.687
And they come in here, they're going
to take your fucking skull apart!

01:38:57.687 --> 01:39:00.707
You're going to beg me
to let them kill you.

01:39:01.370 --> 01:39:03.437
- Come on, break it down!
- Meissner!

01:39:05.168 --> 01:39:06.246
Harder, man. Harder!

01:39:11.146 --> 01:39:13.039
Come on, lean on it!

01:39:13.876 --> 01:39:14.825
No!

01:39:17.335 --> 01:39:18.330
No!

01:39:21.002 --> 01:39:22.897
Take out the glass!

01:39:25.878 --> 01:39:27.982
Come on! Shoot!
Shoot me!

01:39:28.043 --> 01:39:29.597
- Don't shoot!
- Shoot me! Come on!

01:39:29.597 --> 01:39:31.732
He has his hand
taped to the lever.

01:39:32.669 --> 01:39:33.691
No!

01:39:34.378 --> 01:39:38.774
- Don't shoot!
- Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

01:39:38.774 --> 01:39:39.934
Come on, shoot!

01:39:42.503 --> 01:39:44.297
Hold your fire!

01:39:47.045 --> 01:39:48.953
Relax. Just relax.

01:39:50.795 --> 01:39:54.028
I'm glad you're here, Meissner. This
wouldn't be official without witnesses.

01:39:54.087 --> 01:39:58.596
He's bluffing. He's trying to get me to take
responsibility for his escape attempt.

01:39:58.596 --> 01:39:59.600
Just like before.

01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:03.183
I don't want a confession.
You set me up. You set everything up!

01:40:03.254 --> 01:40:06.958
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- I'm talkin' about Chink Weber!

01:40:07.702 --> 01:40:12.607
The goons. The cop that
was gonna rape Melissa!

01:40:13.671 --> 01:40:17.535
Dallas. The killing of the kid.

01:40:19.379 --> 01:40:22.448
- Guilty on all counts.
- Prove it!

01:40:22.448 --> 01:40:26.679
Prove it, Frank! That's your problem.
You can't prove anything.

01:40:27.003 --> 01:40:31.123
I don't have to prove nothin'.
I came here for an execution.

01:40:31.587 --> 01:40:34.750
I de... I demand
to be released from here!

01:40:36.005 --> 01:40:37.684
No! No!

01:40:37.719 --> 01:40:41.626
Don't do it, Leone. Don't do it.
Take it easy.

01:40:42.547 --> 01:40:46.938
- You deserve... payback.
- Frank!

01:40:47.981 --> 01:40:51.010
Please. Please, Frank.

01:40:53.005 --> 01:40:57.534
Don't kill me! It's true.

01:40:59.937 --> 01:41:03.291
I confess.
I confess, Mr. Meissner.

01:41:03.756 --> 01:41:07.949
Everything that he said was true.
I set them up.

01:41:07.984 --> 01:41:09.173
Everything.

01:41:10.923 --> 01:41:12.547
No, please.

01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:17.815
Please. Don't kill me!

01:41:19.632 --> 01:41:21.094
Don't!

01:41:21.758 --> 01:41:27.036
See... you in hell,
Drumgoole!

01:41:44.176 --> 01:41:46.647
Works better with this.

01:41:48.384 --> 01:41:50.596
Take him to the hole,
Mr. Meissner.

01:41:51.295 --> 01:41:55.017
Mr. Braden, take the prisoner
to the hole!

01:41:55.472 --> 01:41:57.304
- Cuff him.
- Yes, sir.

01:41:57.339 --> 01:42:01.175
And somebody get me
out of this chair.

01:42:03.494 --> 01:42:04.477
Come on.

01:42:09.384 --> 01:42:13.288
Thank you, Mr. Meissner.
I said take him to the hole.

01:42:13.926 --> 01:42:18.179
I can't do that.
Take the warden into custody!

01:42:18.179 --> 01:42:18.732
Yes, sir.

01:42:18.732 --> 01:42:20.923
I said take him to the hole.
What are you doing?

01:42:20.968 --> 01:42:21.708
Cuff 'im.

01:42:22.215 --> 01:42:26.669
Stop it! I am warden of this institution,
and you will obey... Stop that!

01:42:27.802 --> 01:42:30.125
That was just a stupid confession
to try and save my life.

01:42:31.308 --> 01:42:33.151
Are you crazy, Mr. Meissner?

01:42:33.635 --> 01:42:35.460
No, but you are.

01:42:35.897 --> 01:42:41.022
Till this matter's resolved in a judicial
inquiry, you will remain in our custody.

01:42:42.845 --> 01:42:50.378
I'll have your ass for this!
I'll have your ass.

01:42:50.970 --> 01:42:52.446
Move 'im.

01:43:04.054 --> 01:43:08.510
- I only wanted to do my time, captain.
- You'll get your chance.

01:43:09.763 --> 01:43:10.960
Move 'im.

01:43:32.533 --> 01:43:34.813
Hang in there, Frank.

01:43:36.045 --> 01:43:37.110
Hey, Frank?

01:43:37.909 --> 01:43:39.890
- Eclipse.
- Take care of yourself.

01:43:39.890 --> 01:43:42.297
Yeah, you too.
Thanks a lot, big man.

01:43:42.977 --> 01:43:47.186
- Yeah. That okay?
- It's all right.

01:43:50.247 --> 01:43:53.589
Got this one
from Fidel Castro his self.

01:43:57.139 --> 01:43:59.105
- See you, big man.
- Okay.

01:44:19.849 --> 01:44:21.060
Hold it.

01:44:22.016 --> 01:44:24.273
Crack the outside!

01:44:25.724 --> 01:44:28.166
You know what I'm gonna
miss most about you, captain?

01:44:28.642 --> 01:44:32.780
- What's that?
- Your incredible smile.

01:44:44.725 --> 01:44:48.222
- Take care of yourself, Leone.
- Thanks, captain.

01:44:59.976 --> 01:45:00.971
Lock 'em!
