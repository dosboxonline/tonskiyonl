00:44.411 --> 00:47.869
<i>Some people hear their own
inner voices...</i>

00:47.948 --> 00:49.677
<i>with great clearness...</i>

00:49.750 --> 00:52.981
<i>and they live
by what they hear.</i>

00:53.053 --> 00:56.147
<i>Such people become crazy...</i>

00:56.223 --> 00:58.487
<i>or they become legend.</i>

01:05.966 --> 01:10.630
<i>Tristan Ludlow was born
in the Moon of the Falling Leaves.</i>

01:10.704 --> 01:13.229
<i>It was a terrible winter.</i>

01:13.307 --> 01:18.301
<i>His mother almost died
bringing him into this world.</i>

01:22.149 --> 01:26.017
<i>His father, the Colonel,
brought him to me.</i>

01:26.086 --> 01:31.251
<i>I wrapped him in a bearskin
and held him all that night.</i>

01:33.761 --> 01:35.695
<i>As he grew into a man...</i>

01:35.763 --> 01:39.199
<i>I taught him the great joy
of the kill...</i>

01:39.266 --> 01:42.030
<i>when the hunter
cuts out its warm heart...</i>

01:42.102 --> 01:45.094
<i>and holds it in his hands...</i>

01:45.172 --> 01:48.164
<i>setting its spirit free.</i>

01:50.210 --> 01:52.701
<i>Colonel Ludlow had three sons...</i>

01:52.780 --> 01:56.341
<i>but Tristan was his favorite.</i>

01:56.417 --> 01:58.442
<i>I had had sons, too.</i>

02:00.321 --> 02:02.255
<i>But they were gone now...</i>

02:02.323 --> 02:03.756
<i>forever.</i>

02:05.092 --> 02:08.220
<i>It was a very bad time.</i>

02:08.294 --> 02:11.658
<i>The Colonel had tried
to help the people...</i>

02:13.967 --> 02:17.368
<i>but it was no use.</i>

02:17.438 --> 02:21.101
<i>So he decided
to go his own way.</i>

02:23.544 --> 02:27.708
<i>He wanted to lose the madness
over the mountains, he said...</i>

02:27.781 --> 02:29.874
<i>and begin again.</i>

02:37.991 --> 02:40.459
<i>"Lose the madness," he said.</i>

02:40.527 --> 02:43.325
<i>And so we lived for many years...</i>

02:43.397 --> 02:45.262
<i>and the boys grew strong.</i>

02:55.042 --> 02:58.273
<i>Alfred was the older brother...</i>

02:58.345 --> 03:00.404
<i>old even for his years.</i>

03:01.949 --> 03:04.918
<i>Samuel was the youngest.</i>

03:04.985 --> 03:08.318
<i>There was nothing these brothers
would not do for him.</i>

03:08.389 --> 03:10.823
<i>They watched over him
like a treasure.</i>

03:12.593 --> 03:14.026
<i>One year...</i>

03:14.094 --> 03:17.757
<i>I am an old man,
cannot remember the year...</i>

03:17.831 --> 03:20.823
<i>But it was the Moon
of the Red Grass...</i>

03:20.901 --> 03:23.597
<i>when Isabel Ludlow,
their mother...</i>

03:23.670 --> 03:25.831
<i>went away for the winter.</i>

03:25.906 --> 03:29.865
<i>She said the winters
were too cruel for her.</i>

03:29.943 --> 03:32.776
<i>She said she was afraid
of the bears.</i>

03:33.981 --> 03:36.279
<i>She was a strange woman anyway.</i>

03:50.564 --> 03:53.931
<i>That spring, though,
she did not return.</i>

03:55.536 --> 04:00.132
<i>And, after that, she did not
come much to see us.</i>

04:01.341 --> 04:04.310
<i>Alfred wrote her many letters...</i>

04:04.378 --> 04:07.814
<i>but Tristan refused
to speak of her.</i>

04:07.881 --> 04:11.214
<i>His world was here with me.</i>

04:14.188 --> 04:18.716
<i>Every warrior hopes
a good death will find him...</i>

04:18.791 --> 04:20.817
<i>but Tristan couldn't wait.</i>

04:22.062 --> 04:24.155
<i>He went looking for his.</i>

05:43.176 --> 05:45.269
Tristan!

05:45.345 --> 05:46.778
Here

05:50.317 --> 05:52.610
- Was it a bear?
- Yes, sir.

05:52.686 --> 05:54.176
- Can you breathe?
- Yes

05:54.254 --> 05:56.347
Take your hand away.
Take it away!

05:59.526 --> 06:02.120
You're a stupid,
half-brained jackass.

06:02.195 --> 06:04.755
- Yes, sir.
- 'One Stab' put you up to this?

06:06.967 --> 06:08.730
You deserve to be dead,
you know that?

06:08.802 --> 06:10.895
God knows how you've
lived so long.

06:10.971 --> 06:12.905
It'll be all right, son.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.785
<i>I have these letters...</i>

06:34.861 --> 06:37.853
<i>many letters.</i>

06:37.931 --> 06:40.331
<i>Read them.</i>

06:40.400 --> 06:42.334
<i>They are from all of them...</i>

06:43.303 --> 06:45.134
<i>Ludlow...</i>

06:45.205 --> 06:46.934
<i>Isabel...</i>

06:47.007 --> 06:48.872
<i>Samuel...</i>

06:48.942 --> 06:50.603
<i>the whole family...</i>

06:50.677 --> 06:53.441
<i>the whole story...</i>

06:53.513 --> 06:56.607
<i>It is all written here.</i>

06:57.884 --> 07:01.012
<i>"April 13, 1913</i>

07:01.088 --> 07:02.885
<i>Dear Isabel,</i>

07:02.956 --> 07:06.915
<i>I am not fool enough to try
to reorder a life already lived...</i>

07:06.994 --> 07:11.431
<i>but I fear I have not done well raising
our sons alone in this wild place.</i>

07:13.000 --> 07:14.968
<i>What did I know of children?</i>

07:15.035 --> 07:17.629
<i>I was trained to lead men.</i>

07:17.704 --> 07:19.934
<i>This is infinitely harder."</i>

07:21.008 --> 07:22.441
<i>"Dear William,</i>

07:22.509 --> 07:26.240
<i>You take too much responsibility
on yourself, as always.</i>

07:26.313 --> 07:28.941
<i>Our sons are finding their own paths.</i>

07:29.016 --> 07:32.281
<i>They are willful, certainly,
but then...</i>

07:32.352 --> 07:35.515
<i>who are you and I
to complain of willfulness?</i>

07:35.589 --> 07:38.023
<i>As for Samuel,
I have big news.</i>

07:38.091 --> 07:40.025
<i>At a Harvard tea
for Amy Lowell...</i>

07:40.093 --> 07:43.995
<i>he met and instantly loved
Miss Susannah Finncannon.</i>

07:44.064 --> 07:46.862
<i>I know it will
surprise you greatly...</i>

07:46.933 --> 07:49.697
<i>but they are engaged.</i>

07:49.700 --> 07:52.333
<i>He will bring her to Montana
this summer to introduce her...</i>

07:52.334 --> 07:54.540
<i>to his brothers
and to you.</i>

07:54.550 --> 07:57.772
<i>So, William,
please behave yourself...</i>

07:57.844 --> 08:01.905
<i>and be as charming
as only you can be."</i>

08:05.118 --> 08:06.585
There he is!

08:10.557 --> 08:13.117
- How the hell are you?
- Good And you?

08:15.962 --> 08:18.487
- Samuel Good to see you, boy.
- Father, how are you?

08:18.565 --> 08:20.089
- Good to see you.
- Hello.

08:23.338 --> 08:27.763
Oh, uh, father...
This is my fiancÃ©e, Susannah.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.139
- Hello.
- Miss Finncannon.

08:32.245 --> 08:34.611
- Nice to meet you.
- It's an honor.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.275
- This is Alfred.
- How do you do?

08:40.886 --> 08:43.321
- Here's your dog, miss.
- Thank you.

08:43.390 --> 08:46.257
- It's a horse.
- That's a strange-looking animal.

08:46.326 --> 08:49.295
This is Finn.
He's a champion.

08:49.362 --> 08:52.456
You like exotic-looking
dogs then, Miss Finncannon?

08:52.532 --> 08:54.432
Very much, Mr. Ludlow.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.432
- Please, call me Susannah.
- All right.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.996
- He's just plain old Alfred.
- Shut up.

09:01.908 --> 09:06.368
- Where's Tristan?
- He's off somewhere. You know him.

09:06.446 --> 09:09.973
He'll welcome you home tonight
or I'll know the reason why.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.515
Miss Finncannon, please.
Did you have a good journey?

09:20.193 --> 09:22.991
<i>"She is such a lovely creature, William</i>

09:23.063 --> 09:24.963
<i>But I fear the loss
of her parents</i>

09:25.031 --> 09:28.831
<i>has given her
a certain fragility</i>

09:28.902 --> 09:31.837
<i>I think she feels very alone
in the world</i>

09:32.973 --> 09:36.340
<i>But she has found a new family now,
hasn't she?"</i>

09:36.409 --> 09:39.276
The German military is ready
to use chaos in Croatia...

09:39.346 --> 09:43.210
as a justification for actions that could
plunge the entire civilized world into...

09:43.283 --> 09:47.451
Samuel... the word "civilized" has no place
in any discussion of the affairs of this world.

09:47.506 --> 09:49.006
Miss Finncannon.

09:49.256 --> 09:52.692
Mother told us of your sympathy
for the social reformers.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.154
You make it sound like a disease.

09:56.230 --> 09:58.359
No, on the contrary,
I'm in agreement.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.958
You mother told me all about One Stab.
She says he was a great warrior.

10:02.035 --> 10:03.502
Yes.

10:03.570 --> 10:06.061
He has a bag of scalps
to prove it.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.265
But don't worry.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.276
He's devoted to Father now.

10:11.344 --> 10:13.073
Or rather, they're devoted
to each other.

10:13.146 --> 10:14.841
Can he speak English?

10:14.915 --> 10:17.383
Stab, speak English?

10:17.450 --> 10:20.886
He wouldn't lower himself
to speak English. Would you, Stab?

10:22.289 --> 10:25.725
But watch out because
he understands it perfectly well.

10:27.527 --> 10:29.495
There's Tristan.

10:49.382 --> 10:51.577
- Don't they feed you?
- Not much.

10:58.258 --> 11:01.421
- You smell.
- Miss me, did you?

11:01.494 --> 11:03.428
- Still hung over?
- Still drunk.

11:07.734 --> 11:10.225
Isn't she amazing?

11:10.303 --> 11:12.168
So this is Tristan.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.433
And does he speak English?

11:19.646 --> 11:21.113
For God's sake!

11:33.159 --> 11:37.118
Miss Finncannon,
it's a pleasure to meet you.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.961
I hope you and Ugly here...

11:40.033 --> 11:41.830
find every happiness together.

11:46.539 --> 11:50.942
Don't mind my brother. Your dog
has more breeding than he has.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.665
This is Mother's room.

12:16.736 --> 12:18.169
It's lovely.

12:21.875 --> 12:24.070
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Pet.
- And you, miss.

12:24.144 --> 12:25.577
Thank you.

12:34.888 --> 12:37.652
- Which one?
- It's this one.

12:42.629 --> 12:44.563
Angelica Susannah.

13:16.329 --> 13:18.593
Hello.

13:19.599 --> 13:21.362
You must be Isabel Two.

13:25.038 --> 13:27.302
I've already met your mother
and father.

13:29.042 --> 13:30.805
- How old are you?
- Thirteen.

13:35.015 --> 13:38.143
When I was 13,
I was sent away...

13:38.218 --> 13:40.243
to boarding school.

13:41.221 --> 13:42.620
I hated it.

13:44.858 --> 13:46.120
May I help you?

13:50.130 --> 13:51.620
You're going to marry Samuel.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.325
That's right, I am.

13:53.400 --> 13:55.391
I'm going to marry Tristan.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.804
We'll be sisters.

14:01.841 --> 14:04.674
I see you two have met.

14:04.744 --> 14:06.473
Isabel Two is letting me help.

14:06.981 --> 14:10.449
Susannah, would you like to take
a rest? You must be exhausted.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.985
No, not at all.
This is so refreshing...

14:13.053 --> 14:16.989
all this grandeur,
this unexpected...

14:17.057 --> 14:19.321
gift from God.

14:19.392 --> 14:23.692
It doesn't seem like much of a gift
in a hard winter, I assure you.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.189
Where's Samuel?

14:26.266 --> 14:29.599
Inside I could tell your father
wanted him all to himself.

14:30.804 --> 14:34.604
- You're very generous.
- No, just happy.

14:38.678 --> 14:40.771
Stop mooning over her
and come in here.

14:40.847 --> 14:44.544
Samuel wants to know
about those calves from Cheyenne.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.107
Get in here!

14:47.720 --> 14:50.484
Please, excuse my father.

14:50.557 --> 14:55.187
It makes him feel young and powerful
to treat us like we're idiot children.

15:01.134 --> 15:04.900
For all His countless blessings,
may God's holy name be praised. Amen.

15:08.108 --> 15:11.475
Tell Father what you were saying
about Vienna.

15:11.544 --> 15:13.705
- What's that?
- It's the Kaiser.

15:14.948 --> 15:17.473
He won't stop them
from annihilating Serbia.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.575
Let's not talk about war, please.

15:20.553 --> 15:23.818
Susannah hears
that England's mobilizing.

15:23.890 --> 15:26.586
We're stuck out here
while all this is going on.

15:26.659 --> 15:30.390
- Well, thank God for that.
- You wouldn't want us to evade a duty

15:30.463 --> 15:33.432
- Wouldn't I?
- Father, with respect...

15:35.201 --> 15:36.896
Please excuse me
for being late.

15:36.970 --> 15:40.030
I packed so carefully,
I couldn't find anything.

15:41.808 --> 15:44.208
Thank you.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.949
Would you like some...

16:00.593 --> 16:04.085
# As evening fell
a maiden stood

16:04.164 --> 16:07.725
# At the edge of a wood

16:07.800 --> 16:11.167
# In her hands lay the reins

16:11.237 --> 16:14.468
# Of a stallion

16:14.541 --> 16:16.133
# And n'er I'd seen

16:16.209 --> 16:18.109
# A girl as fair

16:18.178 --> 16:21.409
# Heard a gentler voice anywhere

16:21.481 --> 16:23.210
# Whispered, alas

16:23.283 --> 16:24.841
# She belonged

16:24.918 --> 16:27.478
# Belonged to another

16:27.554 --> 16:31.081
# Another, forever

16:31.991 --> 16:34.289
# Yes, she belonged to

16:34.360 --> 16:37.727
# The twilight and mist

16:40.667 --> 16:42.692
<i>"Dear Isabel,</i>

16:42.769 --> 16:46.637
<i>How strange to have a cultivated
woman in the house again...</i>

16:46.706 --> 16:48.867
<i>and how intoxicating.</i>

16:48.942 --> 16:52.400
<i>To have all three of my sons
under my roof again...</i>

16:52.478 --> 16:55.811
<i>fills me with such a deep,
quiet satisfaction...</i>

16:55.882 --> 16:58.180
<i>that I thank God."</i>

17:50.203 --> 17:52.103
There's a friend of yours.

18:02.048 --> 18:03.948
A dollar says
he brings her back.

18:49.429 --> 18:52.227
Whoa.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.528
Easy.

19:16.956 --> 19:19.322
You got it.

19:32.472 --> 19:33.837
Nice work.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.904
You guys look
like ice cream cones.

19:39.946 --> 19:41.504
I know you would have.

19:41.581 --> 19:44.482
Ready. Here we go.

19:54.227 --> 19:56.957
Go easy on him, Susannah.

19:57.029 --> 19:58.792
Alfred, you take over.

19:58.865 --> 20:00.127
I must talk to Tristan.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.963
You've disgraced the Colonel's name.

20:04.504 --> 20:07.996
- Nice shiner.
- I'll hit her back.

20:15.916 --> 20:17.348
She's got me spinning.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.078
I bet.

20:19.152 --> 20:23.020
She's got these ideas
and theories, and she's so...

20:25.725 --> 20:27.625
What?

20:27.693 --> 20:31.493
Nothing
How'd you break the mare?

20:33.099 --> 20:34.532
She's what?

20:37.270 --> 20:39.966
She's sort of passionate.

20:40.039 --> 20:42.200
- She a virgin?
- Good Lord, Tristan.

20:42.275 --> 20:44.334
- You brought it up.
- Of course she is.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.037
Are you?

20:50.483 --> 20:53.782
- Yes, I am.
- Going to wait till you're married?

20:55.054 --> 20:56.988
See, she says...

20:58.057 --> 21:00.082
Susannah thinks that...

21:02.962 --> 21:04.486
We're not gonna wait.

21:04.564 --> 21:08.261
And you're afraid you won't
meet her expectations?

21:09.735 --> 21:11.464
I guess I am.

21:11.537 --> 21:15.337
Sort of I don't know
Should I be?

21:15.408 --> 21:17.569
Samuel, God bless you.

21:17.643 --> 21:20.578
You are good
at everything you try.

21:20.646 --> 21:22.341
I'm sure it will be the same
with fucking.

21:22.415 --> 21:24.280
Tristan, really.

21:24.350 --> 21:27.183
- She's my future wife.
- You're not going to fuck her?

21:29.755 --> 21:32.781
I'm planning to be with her.

21:32.859 --> 21:34.554
I recommend fucking.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.755
- You're impossible.
- You brought it up.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.206
My point!

22:12.832 --> 22:14.265
Good morning,
Colonel Ludlow.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.927
Tristan's gone hunting.
Whatever it was, he didn't do it.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.665
You don't have to worry
about Tristan, Colonel.

22:19.739 --> 22:23.573
This is John T and James O'Banion.
They own the mercantile store.

22:23.643 --> 22:28.137
- Morning, James, John T, Sheriff
- Morning, Alfred

22:28.214 --> 22:32.913
We're looking for a man we heard
might be in this part of the country.

22:32.985 --> 22:35.783
Name is Tom Cullen.
Here's a likeness.

22:39.191 --> 22:40.624
What did this fella do?

22:40.693 --> 22:42.285
Do you recognize him?

22:44.196 --> 22:46.756
- Yeah, I recognize him.
- We got him, James.

22:46.832 --> 22:48.925
This fellow passed by here...

22:49.001 --> 22:51.094
maybe four or five years ago

22:51.170 --> 22:55.004
Did some work here. He was
on his way to San Francisco.

22:55.074 --> 22:57.269
He was hoping to book passage
on a boat to Australia.

22:57.319 --> 22:59.019
Australia?

22:59.111 --> 23:00.874
Or was it Hong Kong?
I can't remember.

23:00.947 --> 23:03.381
- Can you remember, Alfred?
- I think it was Hong Kong.

23:04.731 --> 23:06.331
Hong Kong, yeah.

23:07.020 --> 23:09.282
What exactly is he
wanted for, Sheriff?

23:09.332 --> 23:10.232
Well, he...

23:10.256 --> 23:12.849
That would be
of a private nature, sir.

23:12.925 --> 23:16.622
"Private nature"?
It's a public office you hold, Sheriff.

23:18.898 --> 23:20.627
Gentlemen...

23:32.712 --> 23:35.203
"There came a low hiss,
a horrid, cold sound...

23:35.281 --> 23:38.011
that made Rikki Tikki Tavi
jump back two clear feet.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.018
And then inch by inch
out of the grass...

23:40.086 --> 23:43.021
rose up the head
and spread hood of Nag...

23:43.089 --> 23:45.080
the big black cobra."

23:45.157 --> 23:46.749
I can read another story.

23:46.826 --> 23:49.727
The Germans broke through
at Armentieres.

23:49.795 --> 23:53.356
The British are trapped
in the Belgian lowlands.

23:53.432 --> 23:56.333
- This paper is a week old!
- Calm down.

23:56.402 --> 23:58.370
With my fluent German,
I could become an officer.

23:58.437 --> 24:01.031
And lead other boys to the slaughter
and be slaughtered yourself.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.166
The men who served under you
worshipped you.

24:03.242 --> 24:05.005
They were all damn fools.

24:05.077 --> 24:07.409
This is a turning point
in history.

24:07.480 --> 24:08.913
- How can we...
- What?

24:08.981 --> 24:10.846
You can't expect us not to
be part of this.

24:10.916 --> 24:13.714
- You taught us...
- To think for yourselves.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.584
- And to defend what's ours.
- Yes, what is ours!

24:16.656 --> 24:19.124
We've already lost two cousins.

24:19.191 --> 24:22.718
Who we've never met! Don't talk at me
as though I've never seen a war!

24:26.532 --> 24:27.965
Not a war like this.

24:28.034 --> 24:32.630
They said that about the War
of Secession and the Indian wars.

24:32.705 --> 24:35.902
They say it to sell newspapers.

24:35.975 --> 24:39.240
These are not the Indian wars.
We're fighting against naked aggression!

24:39.311 --> 24:42.075
There will be no more talk of wars
in this house! Damn it!

24:45.317 --> 24:46.750
I'm sorry, Susannah.

24:50.523 --> 24:52.457
I'm going to Canada to enlist.

24:57.663 --> 24:59.654
I'm going with him.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.102
I'm sorry, my love.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.204
I meant to speak to you tonight.

25:15.281 --> 25:18.614
I know you'll understand
It's the only honorable thing to do.

25:30.663 --> 25:32.096
What's that?

25:32.164 --> 25:34.598
It's a book my father wrote...

25:36.402 --> 25:40.361
to try to convince the government
to alter their policies...

25:40.439 --> 25:42.669
towards the Indians
in the Dakotas.

25:45.978 --> 25:48.173
Samuel won't change his mind.

25:48.247 --> 25:49.680
Change it for him.

25:59.125 --> 26:01.059
What happened between them?

26:02.895 --> 26:04.829
Father says
she never liked it here.

26:06.966 --> 26:10.561
I think they loved mostly the idea
of each other.

26:21.747 --> 26:23.214
Don't let him go.

26:26.218 --> 26:29.210
I'll take care of him.

Be careful.

29:15.220 --> 29:16.812
You don't have to go.

30:05.771 --> 30:07.170
Good-bye.

30:08.974 --> 30:11.101
Don't worry, Father.

30:11.176 --> 30:12.609
Take care.

30:20.219 --> 30:22.744
I'll bring you
the Kaiser's helmet.

30:22.821 --> 30:25.790

That would please me more.

30:26.925 --> 30:28.825
Yes, sir.

30:47.613 --> 30:49.706
- Take care of Samuel.
- I will.

31:46.572 --> 31:48.904

He'll be back.

32:37.422 --> 32:39.686
May we join you?
Sit down.

32:40.759 --> 32:43.023
Feeling lonely in there.

32:43.095 --> 32:44.528
Sit here.

32:47.266 --> 32:48.733
What's her name, Two?

32:48.800 --> 32:51.860
Lady Tristan's Lady.

32:51.937 --> 32:54.804
In the story,
Tristan's lady was Isolde.

32:54.873 --> 32:57.637
- You know who Isolde was,
don't you? - No.

32:59.611 --> 33:02.580
Decker, your daughter
is in need of education.

33:02.648 --> 33:07.711
She can read and write, Colonel.
School might be awkward for her.

33:07.786 --> 33:11.415
- No, I'll teach her myself.
- May I help?

33:11.490 --> 33:15.893
Yeah I'll teach her
history and mathematics.

33:15.961 --> 33:20.660
With your permission, Decker,
and yours, Pet.

33:20.732 --> 33:21.960
What do you think?

33:28.974 --> 33:30.771
What will she do
with all this education?

33:30.842 --> 33:33.970
She'll live a richer,
fuller life, of course.

33:35.180 --> 33:37.239
She's a half-breed.

33:37.316 --> 33:39.079
Not in this house.

33:39.151 --> 33:42.484
- Tristan calls me a half-breed.
- Tristan calls you a half-breed?

33:42.554 --> 33:44.988
He says I'm half gopher
and half hawk.

33:51.597 --> 33:55.363
- After her chores.
- Yeah.

33:55.434 --> 33:57.368
- To us all.
- To you, sir.

33:57.436 --> 34:00.428
- And miss.
- And to the boys.

34:02.174 --> 34:03.869
And the boys.

34:29.034 --> 34:31.127
Get back to your unit.

34:31.203 --> 34:33.295
Those boys are boring.

34:33.371 --> 34:35.601

for three days...</i>

49:15.620 --> 49:17.713
<i>and drifted over the tracks.</i>

49:17.788 --> 49:23.226
<i>The Colonel insisted
she stay on until spring.</i>

49:24.295 --> 49:27.958
<i>The house was too empty,
he said.</i>

49:28.032 --> 49:31.559
<i>This was still her home,
he told her.</i>

49:34.639 --> 49:37.073
<i>He should have let her go.</i>

49:37.141 --> 49:40.941
<i>But how could he have known
what would happen?</i>

49:45.816 --> 49:48.478
<i>She was not to blame.</i>

49:48.553 --> 49:52.421
<i>She was like the water
that freezes in the rock...</i>

49:52.490 --> 49:54.754
<i>and splits it apart.</i>

49:56.494 --> 50:00.897
<i>It was no more her fault
than it is the fault of the water...</i>

50:00.965 --> 50:03.593
<i>when the rock shatters.</i>

50:14.512 --> 50:16.446
You know how much l...

50:17.848 --> 50:19.782
You know how much
I loved Samuel.

50:20.885 --> 50:24.480
And I think you know...

50:33.364 --> 50:36.128
Out of respect for him,
I wanted to say it in this place.

50:36.200 --> 50:38.964
I think you know that...

50:41.906 --> 50:43.339
I'm in love with you.

50:46.010 --> 50:48.979
From the first moment
I saw you...

50:49.046 --> 50:51.139
like in a novel.

50:57.388 --> 51:02.883
That's my mother's overblown
romantic imagination coming out in me.

51:10.635 --> 51:13.661
You're not making this
very easy for me.

51:14.905 --> 51:16.566
Sorry.

51:17.908 --> 51:21.901
Is there any hope
that you could learn to love me?

51:24.315 --> 51:26.681
Not the way you love Samuel,
of course...

51:26.751 --> 51:30.687
but enough to...

51:34.458 --> 51:36.688
We could make a life together.

51:37.928 --> 51:39.361
A happy life.

51:44.101 --> 51:45.762
I don't think so.

51:50.274 --> 51:54.005
Sounds like you're not sure, though.
Maybe there's a chance?

52:00.618 --> 52:05.214
- What?
- I can only cause you pain, Alfred.

52:07.625 --> 52:10.185
Why don't you let me
be the judge of that?

52:20.471 --> 52:22.905
I didn't break it,
but I can fix it.

52:22.973 --> 52:26.409
I can put the damn wheel back on
and take it off myself.

52:26.477 --> 52:28.411
Go take a nap.

52:40.991 --> 52:43.118
- What?
- Look!

53:29.340 --> 53:31.638
I'm going into town if...

54:14.618 --> 54:16.586
Welcome home, son.

55:30.327 --> 55:33.421
I couldn't save him.

55:33.497 --> 55:35.931
Of course you couldn't.

55:47.344 --> 55:48.777
It's all right.

56:17.875 --> 56:20.309
Have a nice ride today?

56:32.389 --> 56:34.323
Excuse me, Father.

56:55.446 --> 56:57.004
Tristan, please

58:03.313 --> 58:06.407
When are you planning
to be married?

58:06.483 --> 58:08.246
Good morning.

58:13.657 --> 58:15.215
Damn you.

58:15.292 --> 58:17.726
You will marry her.

58:18.696 --> 58:21.756
- Make an honest woman of her?
- Yes!

58:24.001 --> 58:26.094
God damn you to hell.

58:27.337 --> 58:30.397
Yes, I will marry her,
if she'll have me.

58:30.474 --> 58:32.465
If she'll have you?

58:36.513 --> 58:38.447
Do you love her?

58:40.684 --> 58:43.847
Or did you seduce her
just to spite me?

58:43.921 --> 58:45.582
That's not what I did.

58:46.690 --> 58:50.023
- What about Samuel?
- What?

58:50.094 --> 58:51.823
You tell me about Samuel.

58:51.895 --> 58:54.955
We all loved Samuel.
Samuel is dead What?

58:55.032 --> 58:56.659
How convenient for you.

58:58.335 --> 59:01.327
Because you love her,
I will forgive you for that.

59:01.405 --> 59:04.602
Once You say that again,
and we're not brothers

59:08.078 --> 59:10.103
Once!

59:14.051 --> 59:16.611
You know you can't
make her happy.

59:16.687 --> 59:18.552
I'm gonna try.

59:21.058 --> 59:22.650
You will fail.

59:37.074 --> 59:39.008
I'll be leaving today.

59:49.753 --> 59:52.051
I wish you both all the best.

01:00:00.898 --> 01:00:02.729

- Wish me luck.

Nothing.

01:04:29.366 --> 01:04:32.130
I heard from your mother.

01:04:32.202 --> 01:04:36.366
She says Alfred has hooked up
with those damn O'Banion brothers.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:42.276
- He's doing well.
- Alfred's gonna do well wherever he is.

- Except here with us.
- That's my fault.

01:04:45.949 --> 01:04:49.680
- I didn't say that.
- Couldn't save Samuel either, could I?

01:04:49.753 --> 01:04:52.847
Don't you dare say that.
That was in God's hands.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.483

- Yeah?

Isn't that right,
Mr. Sachtleben?

01:06:32.822 --> 01:06:36.087

01:06:36.159 --> 01:06:37.592
Leave it!

01:06:38.662 --> 01:06:42.223
- Yes, sir?
- I want four beers, now.

Do you?
His name is One Stab.

He's a venerated elder of the Cree and has
counted coup on hundreds of his enemies.

He is our friend.
He's thirsty.

A few months.

- What office?
- The United States Congress.

That was the government's resolution
of that particular issue.

01:16:51.641 --> 01:16:55.008
I've seen nothing since then
to persuade me it's gained...

01:16:55.077 --> 01:16:57.545
in wisdom, common sense
or humanity.

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:05.550
Gentlemen, my father, for whom
I have the deepest respect...

01:17:05.621 --> 01:17:10.718
says that the government
has neither wisdom nor humanity.

01:17:10.793 --> 01:17:15.253
I will then consider it
my absolute duty as my father's son...

01:17:15.331 --> 01:17:20.564
to bring both wisdom and humanity
to the United States Congress.

01:17:22.538 --> 01:17:26.235
I thank you for your blessing, Father.
Gentlemen...

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:43.925
- Gentlemen, wait for me in the cars.
- Yes, certainly.

01:17:58.007 --> 01:18:00.976
Are you all right?
What's wrong?

01:18:18.361 --> 01:18:24.027
I don't know what to say.
Tristan's always been wild.

01:18:25.034 --> 01:18:29.471
- You love him for that.
- Do I?

01:18:32.875 --> 01:18:34.934
I suppose I do.

01:18:36.746 --> 01:18:38.441
He does love you.

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:46.154
She's to be your brother's wife.

01:18:49.592 --> 01:18:54.052
Yes, though you better
remind him of that fact.

01:18:54.130 --> 01:18:55.722
He's not here
to defend himself.

01:18:55.798 --> 01:19:00.167
No, but I see you are here
to defend him and what is his...

01:19:00.236 --> 01:19:04.502
even though
he's abandoned her and you.

01:19:04.573 --> 01:19:07.508
I won't even speak
of who else he abandoned.

01:19:07.576 --> 01:19:09.168
Damn you, boy!

01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:12.510
Don't you blame my son
for Samuel's death!

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:15.550
Samuel chose to be a soldier,
and soldiers die...

01:19:15.618 --> 01:19:17.677
sent to their slaughter
by men in government.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:19.516
Parasites like you!

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:21.488
Damn and blast you!

01:19:21.557 --> 01:19:24.355
Damn you.
And damn you, too!

01:19:24.427 --> 01:19:27.089
Shut your mouth.
Leave her out of this!

01:19:27.163 --> 01:19:29.324
Get out of my house
and get off my land.

01:19:29.398 --> 01:19:33.027
Why? Because I want
to serve my country as you did?

01:19:33.102 --> 01:19:36.265
Or because, like you,
I love a woman who doesn't love me?

01:19:37.273 --> 01:19:41.175
He used her and deserted her,
your darling Tristan.

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:42.904
Alfred, don't! Please!

01:19:42.979 --> 01:19:44.708
I loved her!

01:19:46.615 --> 01:19:48.742
I love her still.

01:19:51.988 --> 01:19:55.185
He stole her from me.
If you want to know the truth...

01:19:55.257 --> 01:19:58.590
he stole her from Samuel
before the war.

01:19:58.661 --> 01:20:00.754
God help me, I'll kill you.

01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:07.034
Here.
Read your darling Tristan's letter.

01:20:11.526 --> 01:20:13.926
Susannah...

01:20:14.276 --> 01:20:15.743
You deserve to be happy.

01:20:45.174 --> 01:20:48.769
<i>Late that night we found
the Colonel on the floor...</i>

01:20:48.844 --> 01:20:51.779
<i>beside a cold fire.</i>

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:53.610
<i>He could not move.</i>

01:20:55.351 --> 01:20:57.945
<i>His hair turned white overnight...</i>

01:20:58.020 --> 01:21:00.454
<i>and he became an old man.</i>

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:05.953
<i>And after that,
Tristan sent no more letters.</i>

01:21:07.530 --> 01:21:09.794
<i>As the years passed by...</i>

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:12.959
<i>we would hear that someone
had seen him on a ship...</i>

01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:16.971
<i>going up some river
no white man had gone up before.</i>

01:21:18.541 --> 01:21:21.032
<i>Stories came to us.</i>

01:21:21.110 --> 01:21:23.635
<i>Strange stories.</i>

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:28.145
<i>And then, for years,
there was nothing.</i>

01:21:33.222 --> 01:21:35.486
<i>He was lost to us.</i>

01:21:35.558 --> 01:21:38.152
<i>That was all we knew.</i>

01:21:38.227 --> 01:21:41.995
<i>But every year,
in the Moon of the Falling Leaves...</i>

01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:47.661
<i>I would dream that the bear's voice
inside him had grown silent...</i>

01:21:47.736 --> 01:21:51.502
<i>and that Tristan might again
come to live in the world.</i>

01:21:52.475 --> 01:21:54.500
<i>But then the winter would come.</i>

01:21:55.578 --> 01:21:57.512
<i>And then another spring.</i>

01:21:58.581 --> 01:22:01.675
<i>And still he stayed away.</i>

01:22:31.614 --> 01:22:33.548
What the hell is he doing?

01:23:31.340 --> 01:23:33.604
She's a mean old bitch,
but she's yours.

01:23:40.015 --> 01:23:41.448
Welcome home.

01:23:49.525 --> 01:23:52.119
Old man!
Where's Father?

01:24:17.686 --> 01:24:20.154
He had a stroke some years ago.

01:24:20.222 --> 01:24:22.315
He can't talk now.

01:24:27.563 --> 01:24:29.155
Oh, Father.

01:24:41.710 --> 01:24:43.541
He wants to celebrate.

01:25:08.437 --> 01:25:09.995
I'm happy, too.

01:25:40.803 --> 01:25:42.930
Father, this is for you.

01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:51.576
"Colonel William Ludlow,
from his son Tristan"

01:25:52.348 --> 01:25:54.616
I didn't know

01:25:57.153 --> 01:26:01.253
These are boars' tusks,
made by a Javanese warrior.

01:26:01.323 --> 01:26:03.416
He, too, was a great man.

01:26:21.844 --> 01:26:26.110
I have other things for Mother
and Little Izzy and Susannah.

01:26:31.453 --> 01:26:32.977
What is it?

01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:44.961
Alfred and Miss Susannah...

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:47.627
were married several years ago.

01:26:50.873 --> 01:26:53.137
Your brother's a congressman now.

01:26:54.877 --> 01:26:57.311
They have a big, new place
in Helena.

01:27:02.384 --> 01:27:04.978
It's as it should be.

01:27:05.053 --> 01:27:08.318
Cattle prices dropped
after the war ended.

01:27:09.892 --> 01:27:12.861
The Colonel ain't seem to care.

01:27:12.928 --> 01:27:14.953
He lost just about everything he had.

01:27:16.932 --> 01:27:18.365
We'll make it back...

01:27:18.434 --> 01:27:22.063
on horses or something else
if we have to.

01:27:22.137 --> 01:27:23.627
We'll make it back.

01:27:28.410 --> 01:27:30.901
He's saying that your brother
voted for the Volstead Act.

01:27:30.979 --> 01:27:34.471
Did he? You suggesting
I become a bootlegger?

01:27:34.550 --> 01:27:38.179
Good money in bootlegging,
if you know what you're doing.

01:27:38.253 --> 01:27:39.982
Screw the government.

01:27:40.055 --> 01:27:41.989
Screw them.

01:27:44.426 --> 01:27:47.054
Screw them!
Screw the government.

01:28:43.819 --> 01:28:46.379
Forever turned out
to be too long.

01:28:48.357 --> 01:28:49.790
I know.

01:29:00.736 --> 01:29:02.601
Here.

01:29:02.671 --> 01:29:05.071
I don't want it.

01:29:12.180 --> 01:29:16.014
They told me
that this was magic...

01:29:16.084 --> 01:29:19.952
that whoever wore it
would be protected.

01:29:27.629 --> 01:29:29.153
Keep it.

01:29:48.717 --> 01:29:51.345
Don't you want to see Alfred?

01:29:52.888 --> 01:29:55.618
It's probably better
that I don't.

01:30:00.262 --> 01:30:02.492
Tell him hello...

01:30:02.564 --> 01:30:05.328
and congratulations.

01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:46.564
He likes you.

01:30:50.212 --> 01:30:51.736
Welcome home.

01:30:53.615 --> 01:30:55.048
Isabel?

01:30:58.620 --> 01:31:00.417
I want you to have him.

01:31:01.289 --> 01:31:04.224
I have something for you too.

01:31:04.292 --> 01:31:06.226
I brought it back.

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:09.729
It's from Ierapetra.

01:31:09.798 --> 01:31:11.766
- That's in...
- Crete.

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:13.960
- Yeah.
- I know where it is.

01:31:14.036 --> 01:31:16.903
Your father taught me
European history.

01:31:19.141 --> 01:31:22.372
A little girl.
That's me, right?

01:31:25.480 --> 01:31:27.243
Thank you.

01:31:53.175 --> 01:31:56.144
Okay, we'll see you
in a few days.

01:31:59.014 --> 01:32:00.948
Don't wait on me.
I'll be fine.

01:32:02.517 --> 01:32:06.681
<i>It was then that Tristan came
into the quiet heart...</i>

01:32:06.755 --> 01:32:08.780
<i>of his life.</i>

01:32:08.857 --> 01:32:12.452
<i>The bear inside him was sleeping.</i>

01:32:14.696 --> 01:32:17.631
<i>It is hard to tell
of happiness.</i>

01:32:19.201 --> 01:32:21.294
<i>Time goes by...</i>

01:32:21.369 --> 01:32:24.133
<i>and we feel safe too soon.</i>

01:32:25.540 --> 01:32:25.741
- I heard the oddest news.
- Yes?

01:32:25.741 --> 01:32:28.471
- I heard the oddest news
- Yes?

01:32:28.543 --> 01:32:29.976
Yes.

01:32:31.046 --> 01:32:33.640
Tristan...

01:32:33.715 --> 01:32:35.148
is back.

01:32:37.385 --> 01:32:39.319
Yes, I know.

01:32:41.056 --> 01:32:42.489
You know?

01:32:43.725 --> 01:32:45.659
How do you know?

01:32:49.664 --> 01:32:51.188
I saw him.

01:32:52.734 --> 01:32:57.637
He had the audacity
to come here just to see you?

01:32:57.706 --> 01:33:00.470
He wanted to see you,
but thought you'd get upset.

01:33:02.110 --> 01:33:04.010
He might be right.

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.354
What did he...

01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:16.185
What did he say?

01:33:16.258 --> 01:33:17.816
He said to say hello...

01:33:18.927 --> 01:33:20.895
and congratulations.

01:33:24.933 --> 01:33:26.764
Silly me.

01:33:28.436 --> 01:33:30.996
He told you the news?

01:33:32.107 --> 01:33:34.541
What do you think?

01:33:37.112 --> 01:33:40.047
Come on.
It's perfectly absurd.

01:33:41.449 --> 01:33:43.349
Marrying Isabel Two

01:33:43.418 --> 01:33:47.548
God, she's practically our sister.

01:33:49.291 --> 01:33:52.226
She can't be more than,
what, 19?

01:33:53.295 --> 01:33:54.853
Twenty.

01:33:54.930 --> 01:33:58.263
I can't imagine what the hell
is Decker thinking of...

01:33:58.333 --> 01:34:00.733
to allow this.

01:34:00.802 --> 01:34:04.238
Perhaps he's thinking
of his daughter's happiness.

01:34:07.342 --> 01:34:11.176
Happiness?
With Tristan?

01:34:12.647 --> 01:34:16.583
You, of all people,
should know how impossible that is.

01:34:16.651 --> 01:34:19.085
I'm not Isabel Two.

01:34:29.164 --> 01:34:31.257
<i>"June 2, 1921</i>

01:34:31.333 --> 01:34:32.823
<i>Dear Tristan,</i>

01:34:32.901 --> 01:34:36.428
<i>I was so pleased to hear
of your coming marriage.</i>

01:34:38.340 --> 01:34:40.171
<i>Your father must be very happy.</i>

01:34:41.142 --> 01:34:43.440
<i>Isabel Two is like
a daughter to him...</i>

01:34:45.180 --> 01:34:48.115
<i>as she was named
after your own mother.</i>

01:34:48.183 --> 01:34:52.119
<i>It seems as though it was always
meant to be, doesn't it?"</i>

01:34:58.026 --> 01:34:59.653
Damnation!

01:36:29.951 --> 01:36:31.885
Samuel Decker Ludlow

01:36:40.128 --> 01:36:42.062
<i>"Dearest Tristan,</i>

01:36:44.299 --> 01:36:47.564
<i>Alfred and I were delighted
to hear of your son's birth.</i>

01:36:47.635 --> 01:36:51.571
<i>We hoped for a child of our own,
but of that I despair.</i>

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:54.904
<i>I know Alfred thinks of you often.</i>

01:36:54.976 --> 01:36:58.412
<i>I look forward to the day when we
all might see one another again.</i>

01:37:02.484 --> 01:37:05.248
<i>Your son bears a proud
and noble name.</i>

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:07.083
<i>I know he will live up to it.</i>

01:37:11.993 --> 01:37:14.257
<i>Please give my love
to Isabel Two...</i>

01:37:14.329 --> 01:37:16.923
<i>and to your father
and everyone else.</i>

01:37:16.998 --> 01:37:19.762
<i>Yours always, Susannah."</i>

01:37:30.845 --> 01:37:33.507
Good evening, gentlemen

01:37:33.581 --> 01:37:36.379
Been meaning to talk to you
about one or two things

01:37:36.451 --> 01:37:37.941
By all means.

01:37:38.019 --> 01:37:40.487
As you know perfectly well...

01:37:40.555 --> 01:37:42.489
we handle the liquor around here.

01:37:42.557 --> 01:37:46.618
Now, you've been
a small-time operator.

01:37:46.694 --> 01:37:48.685
An amateur, frankly.

01:37:48.763 --> 01:37:52.631
Lately, your shipments
have been getting a little fat...

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:55.191
and my patience
has been getting a little thin.

01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:59.138
So the next time
you get in our way...

01:37:59.207 --> 01:38:00.697
will be the last time.

01:38:01.876 --> 01:38:04.845
Excuse me.
I appreciate it.

01:38:04.913 --> 01:38:07.677
Perhaps you're wondering
why you're not dead already.

01:38:08.750 --> 01:38:11.480
Because your brother
is Congressman Ludlow.

01:38:11.553 --> 01:38:13.817
And that's it
And that's all.

01:38:20.395 --> 01:38:22.056
Kenneth, Thomas...

01:38:48.756 --> 01:38:50.417
Can't you just say hello?

01:39:04.272 --> 01:39:08.231
- Hello, Alfred.
- Hello, Tristan.

01:39:16.951 --> 01:39:19.385
- Who's this young man?
- This is Samuel.

01:39:26.427 --> 01:39:28.395
She's beautiful.

01:39:34.402 --> 01:39:35.926
Let me see.

01:39:44.179 --> 01:39:48.707
- Who is this lady?
- I'm your Aunt Susannah.

01:39:51.653 --> 01:39:55.487
I used to know your Uncle Samuel
who died in the war.

01:39:59.627 --> 01:40:02.892
- You look like him.
- That's what Grandpa says.

01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:09.231
He was very brave and very good.

01:40:09.304 --> 01:40:10.999
Grandpa says that too.

01:40:11.072 --> 01:40:14.769
Grandpa says I can have
Uncle Samuel's gun when I'm bigger.

01:40:14.842 --> 01:40:16.707
Would you come and see it?

01:40:23.017 --> 01:40:25.144
I'd love to.

01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:27.154
Sometime.

01:40:29.691 --> 01:40:33.422
- He's a fine boy.
- He is.

01:40:35.196 --> 01:40:40.031
- How is Father? Well?
- As well as can be expected

01:40:45.039 --> 01:40:47.667
- I wish...
- Pardon the intrusion

01:40:49.444 --> 01:40:52.880
Excuse me.
We're ready for your speech now.

01:40:52.947 --> 01:40:54.778
I'll be there in a minute.

01:40:54.849 --> 01:40:56.180
Thank you.

01:41:11.065 --> 01:41:14.398
- We'll meet again soon?
- I'd like that.

01:41:46.067 --> 01:41:47.591
Watch this.

01:41:54.976 --> 01:41:56.807
Go and get Tynert.

01:42:01.449 --> 01:42:03.713
I think you missed a bump, Stab.

01:42:22.537 --> 01:42:23.799
Jesus!

01:42:23.871 --> 01:42:26.567
Sir, we have information
that you're transporting goods...

01:42:26.641 --> 01:42:28.632
in violation
of the Volstead Act.

01:42:28.710 --> 01:42:31.611
If you mean a case of Irish whiskey
for my father, I am.

01:42:31.679 --> 01:42:33.271
Give it up.

01:42:34.248 --> 01:42:35.806
He'll be a bit disappointed.

01:43:07.915 --> 01:43:09.906
Hold him down.

01:43:11.352 --> 01:43:13.149
Let's get out of here.

01:43:13.221 --> 01:43:16.588
- There's an envelope in his pocket.
- Now.

01:43:22.130 --> 01:43:27.295
My brother told you
to stay out of our way.

01:43:31.807 --> 01:43:34.136
Pick him up
and put him in the car.

01:45:13.140 --> 01:45:15.904
- I don't want to see him.
- Father...

01:45:15.977 --> 01:45:17.410
I don't want to see him.

01:45:37.999 --> 01:45:39.557
I'm so very sorry.

01:45:46.674 --> 01:45:49.438
Father won't see me, even now?

01:45:51.012 --> 01:45:54.812
He blames the government
for Isabel's...

01:46:02.189 --> 01:46:04.623
There's something
we have to talk about.

01:46:06.527 --> 01:46:10.258
The officer you beat
almost died.

01:46:11.532 --> 01:46:13.397
Now, everyone understands...

01:46:15.536 --> 01:46:19.871
but they say you have to
plead guilty, serve 30 days.

01:46:19.907 --> 01:46:22.837
And the one who
shot off his gun?

01:46:25.212 --> 01:46:27.146
He was...

01:46:28.382 --> 01:46:29.940
reprimanded.

01:46:30.918 --> 01:46:34.854
- The O'Banions?
- Nothing.

01:46:35.890 --> 01:46:37.653
You have to let it go

01:46:37.725 --> 01:46:41.821
It was a terrible, tragic accident.

01:46:41.896 --> 01:46:44.490
Listen to me.

01:46:44.565 --> 01:46:47.329
You let this go now.

01:46:47.401 --> 01:46:49.835
You got in over your head.

01:46:54.408 --> 01:46:56.308
I'll need a minute.

01:47:37.985 --> 01:47:39.919
I'm so sorry.

01:47:42.123 --> 01:47:44.216
We all loved her.

01:47:47.395 --> 01:47:48.919
How are you?

01:47:50.598 --> 01:47:52.031
I'm fine.

01:47:59.974 --> 01:48:01.908
We never get to see you.

01:48:07.648 --> 01:48:10.583
I gave a speech the other day.

01:48:10.651 --> 01:48:12.915
- You did?
- Yes.

01:48:12.987 --> 01:48:15.581
My first public engagement.

01:48:23.998 --> 01:48:28.435
It was on the responsibilities
of women in...

01:48:35.009 --> 01:48:36.943
It's good to see you.

01:49:03.370 --> 01:49:05.201
I'm sorry.

01:49:14.048 --> 01:49:16.846
I still sometimes dream...

01:49:16.917 --> 01:49:19.283
that I'm the mother
of your children.

01:49:29.897 --> 01:49:31.489
I wanted her to die.

01:49:34.568 --> 01:49:37.628
Maybe I even wanted Samuel to die.

01:49:44.245 --> 01:49:47.510
You had nothing to do
with Samuel's death.

01:49:47.581 --> 01:49:50.049
And you had nothing to do
with Isabel's death.

01:49:52.253 --> 01:49:53.686
Didn't I?

01:49:55.923 --> 01:49:57.413
Go home.

01:50:00.594 --> 01:50:02.926
Go home to Alfred

01:50:29.623 --> 01:50:31.056
Where were you?

01:50:32.793 --> 01:50:35.057
I just went out for a walk.

01:50:35.129 --> 01:50:39.065
I needed a walk.
What are you doing home?

01:50:39.133 --> 01:50:41.897
Your doctor rang,
said you missed your appointment.

01:50:41.969 --> 01:50:44.563
I called home.
You weren't here l...

01:50:45.539 --> 01:50:47.564
I feel very tired.

01:50:48.976 --> 01:50:50.739
I'm going to get to bed.

01:56:59.346 --> 01:57:03.442
"You have won her.
I am bringing her home.

01:57:03.517 --> 01:57:05.508
Alfred."

01:57:41.522 --> 01:57:43.815
I followed all the rules.

01:57:46.059 --> 01:57:48.323
Man's and God's.

01:57:50.230 --> 01:57:51.822
And you...

01:57:53.734 --> 01:57:55.167
You followed none of them.

01:58:01.241 --> 01:58:03.675
And they all loved you more.

01:58:07.748 --> 01:58:10.512
Samuel, Father...

01:58:14.755 --> 01:58:18.350
and even my own wife.

01:58:29.936 --> 01:58:33.428
I'd like a moment
alone with her.

01:59:17.484 --> 01:59:19.076
You know, when Samuel died...

01:59:24.324 --> 01:59:27.088
When Samuel died, I cursed God.

01:59:37.404 --> 01:59:40.840
And I damn everybody around me
as well as myself.

01:59:44.344 --> 01:59:49.441
You are not damned.

01:59:49.516 --> 01:59:52.280
I won't allow that.

01:59:53.353 --> 01:59:56.186
You're not damned!

02:00:39.900 --> 02:00:42.164
Samuel,
this is a gentleman's gun.

02:00:42.235 --> 02:00:44.703
It's a lot smaller,
but it's just as powerful.

02:00:44.771 --> 02:00:48.138
That's what you want
when you grow up, isn't it? A gun.

02:00:50.610 --> 02:00:52.373
Samuel, come here!

02:00:58.618 --> 02:01:03.612
Run along now. Go with Pet.
Get him in the house.

02:01:07.494 --> 02:01:09.587
He's a fine boy.

02:01:15.101 --> 02:01:17.569
You know we're not here
to arrest you.

02:01:34.221 --> 02:01:37.155
You take me to the woods.
I don't want my boy to see.

02:01:41.795 --> 02:01:43.558
Let's get on with it.

02:01:46.366 --> 02:01:48.596
- Father.
- Colonel Ludlow, sir.

02:01:49.636 --> 02:01:51.536
What's going on here?

02:01:53.139 --> 02:01:54.800
What's going on here?

02:04:13.747 --> 02:04:18.013
You don't have to be a genius to know
they'll come after you for this.

02:04:18.952 --> 02:04:20.385
Yeah.

02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:28.287
Yeah?

02:04:31.631 --> 02:04:35.226
I want to ask you
to watch over my children.

02:04:38.304 --> 02:04:40.431
Watch over Samuel.

02:04:49.082 --> 02:04:51.312
Brother, it would be an honor.

02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:18.106
<i>How much I wanted
to take scalps...</i>

02:05:18.178 --> 02:05:20.442
<i>but it was not my kill.</i>

02:05:36.362 --> 02:05:39.456
<i>That night,
we buried the bodies...</i>

02:05:39.532 --> 02:05:44.469
<i>and dumped the car in a deep pool
in the upper Missouri.</i>

02:05:44.537 --> 02:05:47.631
<i>I remember when he was a boy.</i>

02:05:47.707 --> 02:05:52.303
<i>I thought Tristan would never live
to be an old man.</i>

02:05:52.378 --> 02:05:55.313
<i>I was wrong about that.</i>

02:05:55.381 --> 02:05:59.147
<i>I was wrong about many things.</i>

02:05:59.219 --> 02:06:03.315
<i>It was those who loved him most
who died young.</i>

02:06:04.557 --> 02:06:08.493
<i>He was a rock
they broke themselves against...</i>

02:06:08.561 --> 02:06:11.496
<i>however much
he tried to protect them.</i>

02:06:12.966 --> 02:06:15.662
<i>But he had his honor...</i>

02:06:15.735 --> 02:06:17.999
<i>and a long life...</i>

02:06:18.071 --> 02:06:20.835
<i>and he saw his children grow...</i>

02:06:20.907 --> 02:06:23.501
<i>and raise their own families.</i>

02:06:27.080 --> 02:06:30.516
<i>Tristan died in 1963...</i>

02:06:30.583 --> 02:06:34.019
<i>in the Moon of the Popping Trees.</i>

02:06:34.087 --> 02:06:37.352
<i>He was last seen
up in the north country...</i>

02:06:37.423 --> 02:06:40.688
<i>where the hunting was still good.</i>

02:06:40.760 --> 02:06:43.354
<i>His grave is unmarked...</i>

02:06:43.429 --> 02:06:46.364
<i>but it does not matter.</i>

02:06:46.432 --> 02:06:50.027
<i>He had always lived
in the borderland anyway, ...</i>

02:06:50.103 --> 02:06:53.869
<i>somewhere between this world
and the other.</i>

02:07:32.979 --> 02:07:35.072
<i>It was a good death.</i>

02:07:36.305 --> 02:07:42.241
