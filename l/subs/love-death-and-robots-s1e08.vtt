[male narrator] <i>When I was a child,</i>

When will she come?

00:58.297 --> 01:03.588
Soon, Liang. A <i>huli jing</i> cannot resist
the cries of the man she's bewitched.

Oof!

02:26.838 --> 02:29.547
The piss, toss it on her

02:38.588 --> 02:41.547
[whispers] You are a <i>very </i>brave boy.

Throw it! Now!

-Father, I'm sorry.

04:31.338 --> 04:34.672
Why are you hunting us?
We did nothing to you.

04:34.838 --> 04:38.672
Your mother bewitched the merchant's son.
We were hired to save him.

04:38.963 --> 04:39.922
Bewitched?

04:43.005 --> 04:44.755
He's the one who wouldn't leave <i>her </i>alone.

04:45.047 --> 04:46.088
That's not true.

04:46.797 --> 04:49.338
Once a man has set his heart
on a <i>huli jing,</i>

04:49.547 --> 04:52.005
she can hear him,
no matter how far apart they are.

04:52.922 --> 04:55.172
All that moaning and crying,

04:55.255 --> 04:58.505
she has to go to him every night
just to keep him quiet.

04:58.797 --> 05:02.422
No, she lures men and feeds on them
for her evil magic.

05:02.963 --> 05:07.463
A man can fall in love with a <i>huli jing</i>
just like he can with a human woman.

05:07.630 --> 05:10.005
-It's not the same!
-Not the same?

05:11.547 --> 05:13.172
I saw how you looked at me.

05:14.755 --> 05:15.838
-[Tsiao-Jung] Yan!

05:16.172 --> 05:20.005
Do not speak to that human!
You know how dangerous they are.

05:32.213 --> 05:35.047
[father] Liang, have you seen 
any sign of pups?

05:38.380 --> 05:39.963
Are you listening to me?

05:40.047 --> 05:41.547
Yes, Father, I...

05:43.713 --> 05:45.672
I've seen no sign of any pups.

05:46.088 --> 05:46.963
Fine.

05:47.630 --> 05:50.672
Let's collect the bounty
for this <i>huli jing </i>head.

06:00.213 --> 06:02.797
[Liang] <i>It was five years later</i>
<i>that my father died.</i>

06:05.172 --> 06:07.588
<i>I laid him to rest next to my mother.</i>

06:08.797 --> 06:10.588
<i>I miss my father terribly...</i>

06:11.713 --> 06:15.380
<i>but a part of me was relieved</i>
<i>he died when he did,</i>

06:15.463 --> 06:18.255
<i>before the first trains</i>
<i>roared through the village.</i>

06:19.422 --> 06:23.338
<i>The world was modernizing.</i>
<i>He would not have understood.</i>

06:25.172 --> 06:28.547
<i>There were many things</i>
<i>he would not have understood.</i>

06:30.547 --> 06:33.005
<i>Yan never blamed me for what had happened.</i>

06:33.713 --> 06:36.630
<i>Sometimes, the hunter became the hunted.</i>

06:36.713 --> 06:37.838
Hello, Yan.

06:40.380 --> 06:41.213
Thank you.

06:42.755 --> 06:43.755
How is hunting?

06:46.172 --> 06:47.713
Worse this year than last.

06:47.797 --> 06:50.963
It's getting harder and harder for me
to return to my true form.

06:51.297 --> 06:53.255
Some nights, I can't do it at all.

06:53.922 --> 06:55.172
What's causing it?

06:55.797 --> 06:58.463
Iron roads
and machines that breathe smoke.

06:59.088 --> 07:01.297
Magic is draining from the world
and with it,

07:01.380 --> 07:04.005
we magical creatures grow ever weaker.

07:04.713 --> 07:07.422
Yan, I have to tell you something.

07:16.630 --> 07:18.255
[Liang] I'm going to leave the village.

07:19.922 --> 07:21.338
[Yan] Where will you go?

07:22.755 --> 07:23.922
I don't know yet.

07:24.713 --> 07:27.297
I just... I wanted to tell you.

07:27.963 --> 07:29.047
What will you do?

07:31.130 --> 07:32.755
Learn to survive.

07:37.297 --> 07:39.130
[upbeat orchestrated music plays]

07:39.255 --> 07:41.088
[Liang] <i>I ended up in Hong Kong,</i>

07:41.505 --> 07:44.213
<i>-working the train line at Victoria Peak.</i>
-[train bell clangs]

07:45.505 --> 07:49.838
<i>It was there that the English lived,</i>
<i>our colonial masters.</i>

07:50.922 --> 07:53.380
<i>We could take them up to</i>
<i>the top of that mountain,</i>

07:53.463 --> 07:55.880
<i>but we were forbidden to stay.</i>

07:56.672 --> 08:01.672
<i>After five years, I knew the grinding of</i>
<i>the gears and the rumbling of the pistons</i>

08:02.172 --> 08:04.297
<i>as well as I knew my own heartbeat.</i>

08:07.797 --> 08:09.047
[clang]

08:09.547 --> 08:13.630
Yes, very clever, Liang, for a Chinaman.

08:13.713 --> 08:15.880
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

08:21.422 --> 08:22.838
[men laughing]

08:22.922 --> 08:24.422
[man] Oh, come now.

08:24.505 --> 08:27.922
How can you be done for the day
when there's good money to be earned?

08:28.338 --> 08:30.463
Please, I'm very tired.

08:30.547 --> 08:32.630
Oh, don't be shy now.

08:32.713 --> 08:35.505
You Chinese are goers,
everyone knows that.

08:35.588 --> 08:37.463
[Liang] Hey! Leave her alone!

08:37.880 --> 08:39.797
This isn't your business, boy.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.588
I said, leave her alone.

08:43.672 --> 08:46.880
I said piss off, you fucking chink.

08:46.963 --> 08:51.838
Why don't you go find
what you're looking for elsewhere?

08:52.963 --> 08:55.463
Right, yes, of course.

08:57.963 --> 08:59.963
[clock tower chimes]

09:00.630 --> 09:02.213
[Liang] How is hunting?

09:02.672 --> 09:04.963
[Yan] I'm stuck now in this human form:

09:05.547 --> 09:07.380
no claws, no sharp teeth.

09:07.880 --> 09:09.713
I can't even run very fast.

09:10.213 --> 09:11.797
All I have is my beauty.

09:13.047 --> 09:16.380
Now, I live by the very thing
you accused my mother of:

09:16.463 --> 09:18.672
I bewitch men for money.

09:20.005 --> 09:21.005
And you?

09:21.838 --> 09:24.547
[Liang] I also serve our English masters.

09:25.130 --> 09:27.713
I keep their precious trains running.

09:32.380 --> 09:34.547
Are you happy keeping
their engines running?

09:35.380 --> 09:36.297
Happy?

09:36.755 --> 09:39.047
I don't know, but I'm good at it.

09:39.963 --> 09:43.797
I dream of hunting in this jungle
of metal and asphalt.

09:43.880 --> 09:48.963
I imagine my true form leaping from beam
to ledge to terrace roof

09:49.047 --> 09:50.963
until I am at the top of this island.

09:51.338 --> 09:55.838
Until I can growl in the faces of all
the men who believe they can own me.

09:59.338 --> 10:00.963
[Liang] <i>I meant what I said to Yan.</i>

10:01.047 --> 10:02.588
<i>I enjoyed my work.</i>

10:03.130 --> 10:04.797
<i>As the years passed,</i>

10:04.880 --> 10:06.505
<i>I learned more and more.</i>

10:06.922 --> 10:10.838

10:24.297 --> 10:28.047

[cat purring]

10:30.588 --> 10:33.380

The Governor.

11:27.838 --> 11:29.463
<i>For months, he had been a client,</i>

11:30.588 --> 11:32.047

11:32.963 --> 11:34.672
<i>He'd pay, but we never...</i>

11:36.130 --> 11:40.088
<i>Then, one night,</i>
<i>he put something in my drink.</i>

11:49.630 --> 11:51.297

[screams]

11:59.463 --> 12:01.463
[gears grind]

12:08.005 --> 12:12.338
The truth is
he could only get hard for machines,

12:13.713 --> 12:17.922
and he wanted the ultimate machine
to serve that twisted desire.

12:22.672 --> 12:24.755
<i>One night, I'd finally had enough.</i>

12:25.255 --> 12:26.338
<i>I told him no.</i>

[screaming]

12:54.755 --> 12:57.088
We'll find some way to reverse this, Yan.

12:57.630 --> 12:59.297
It's too late for that, Liang.

12:59.963 --> 13:01.713
What I want is to hunt.

13:01.797 --> 13:04.213
Hunt the men who think they can own us.

13:04.297 --> 13:07.338
The men who perpetrate evil,
but call it progress.
