14:04.193 --> 14:07.457
Go to somewhere that has

14:07.458 --> 14:10.125
Like when you worked in the Narcotics
in LA

14:10.126 --> 14:13.129
I do not understand how
dropped everything to come here.

14:13.748 --> 14:17.150
The most exciting thing I've

14:55.752 --> 14:57.735

23:10.029 --> 23:11.986
I look like a sucker?

23:12.282 --> 23:14.039
Want me pegunte him that?

23:14.066 --> 23:16.053
Not, ask why he's dressed like
.

23:16.055 --> 23:20.591
Why is with that outfit?
Why are you dressed like that?

23:28.877 --> 23:32.819
He said it
supporter of the Dutch team.

23:33.220 --> 23:35.908
- And what does this have to do?
- The soccer team.

23:35.909 --> 23:38.652
Is wearing the team colours.

23:39.230 --> 23:42.087
You're mocking
with my face, right?

23:43.142 --> 23:45.915
Okay. I get into the game.

23:47.506 --> 23:50.741
Country that the "Dutch" come from?

23:54.836 --> 23:58.204
He said the arm is aching because you
grabbed him tightly.

23:58.226 --> 24:01.328
He'd catch something.
I worried about my life.

24:01.346 --> 24:04.536
I tried to hit you.
I should have hit harder.

24:04.662 --> 24:06.754
This is bullshit.

24:06.890 --> 24:09.508
Now you speak my language, is it?

24:09.770 --> 24:11.644
If you understand Spanish,

24:11.645 --> 24:14.239
know I was talking a lot of nonsense
.

24:14.240 --> 24:15.841
Ok, trickster.

24:16.540 --> 24:18.604
Who was in the street at 4 am?

24:18.605 --> 24:20.830
We're in Vegas, man!

24:27.916 --> 24:30.090
Lord, we find something.

24:45.562 --> 24:49.173
- Ray Owens. What?
- Hi, sheriff.

24:49.176 --> 24:51.667
Christie's . I woke you?

24:51.668 --> 24:54.466
No, no. I was already awake.

24:54.509 --> 24:55.809
<i>What do you want?</i>

24:55.810 --> 24:58.658
Is that... I got
to open the restaurant

24:58.689 --> 25:01.253
and milk had not been delivered yet
.

25:02.476 --> 25:04.936
Is that really a police matter?

25:05.065 --> 25:08.590
Mr. Parson
always delivers fresh milk early.

25:08.879 --> 25:10.716
<i>He wakes up very early, you know</i>

25:10.766 --> 25:13.813
<i>I do not care  milk. The movement is
bit on weekends.</i>

25:13.814 --> 25:17.703
<i>But he was always punctual,
from what I remember.</i>

25:17.907 --> 25:21.789
- I'm worried about him.
- Ever thought of calling him?

25:21.866 --> 25:25.244
<i>That old fashioned and stubborn
has no phone.</i>

25:25.596 --> 25:27.375
Oh, yeah.

25:28.106 --> 25:29.363
I forgot.

25:29.394 --> 25:32.990
I fear he infracted. Sorry
him awake.

25:32.991 --> 25:37.979
Is that... there was nobody here
and I did not know who to call.

25:38.096 --> 25:40.150
You acted correctly, Christie.

25:40.165 --> 25:43.517
I'll send one of my assistants
there to look at it.

25:43.518 --> 25:45.161
- Okay?
- Thank you, Sheriff.

25:45.162 --> 25:46.929
Okay. Goodbye.

25:49.477 --> 25:51.967
Cortez and his men dropped
a sedan white

25:51.968 --> 25:54.452
and split into 2 different cars.

25:54.553 --> 25:58.537
And right now,
think Cortez is in here.

25:58.538 --> 26:00.234
Stop right there!

26:04.790 --> 26:07.955
- What car is this?
- Where's Mitchell? He understands.

26:07.989 --> 26:10.948
- Mitchell! Come here!
- Lord?

26:11.202 --> 26:12.902
Increase . Look.

26:12.903 --> 26:15.227
View . What car is this?

26:16.803 --> 26:18.746
I think is a ZR-1.

26:19.136 --> 26:22.469
- And what the hell is a ZR-1?
- A Corvette ZR-1.

26:22.570 --> 26:25.331
This one was modified
pras fairs cars.

26:25.332 --> 26:26.635
Is a monster on wheels.

26:26.903 --> 26:30.500
Appeared in everything
newspaper 2 days ago. It was stolen in LA.

26:30.501 --> 26:35.315
Normally Corvettes have a 700 hp,
but this has more than 1,000.

26:36.346 --> 26:38.884
We a psychopath in a Bat mobile.

26:39.547 --> 26:41.265
How do we stop this?

26:41.305 --> 26:43.105
Uh... exploding it?

26:43.517 --> 26:46.109
And if you have a hostage inside?

26:52.081 --> 26:54.666
Legal. Let's move to
Intelligence.

26:54.766 --> 26:57.217
This is the car that we seek.

27:00.416 --> 27:03.560
<i>The car we're looking
is a modified Corvette ZR-1.</i>

27:03.628 --> 27:05.264
I see the photo here.

27:05.365 --> 27:07.817
Warning when I locate it.

27:14.588 --> 27:15.588
Hi, officer.

27:15.589 --> 27:17.058
Enabling and car documents.

27:17.059 --> 27:18.458
Yes, sir.

27:19.916 --> 27:21.761
My qualification...

27:25.346 --> 27:27.133
and the car documents.

27:59.979 --> 28:02.966
Is the Corvette!
I repeat: the Corvette!

28:56.306 --> 28:57.602
Then, Jerry...

28:57.796 --> 29:00.292
Easy, cowboy. Do not enter the yard
Parson unannounced.

29:00.293 --> 29:02.488
Know how it is. Right?

29:02.946 --> 29:05.665
Hey, Mr. Parson!
Jerry Bailey's!

29:05.666 --> 29:09.969
Only came to know the Lord, then
not shoot at us, okay?

29:12.926 --> 29:15.532
- Let's go around the back.
- Okay.

29:25.876 --> 29:27.541
Damn!

29:27.946 --> 29:29.803
Cannot open.

29:35.336 --> 29:38.264
Hey, genius, why not try
doors first?

29:46.646 --> 29:48.341
Mr. Parson?

29:51.236 --> 29:53.812
I'll look up there.
You search here.

30:46.336 --> 30:48.322
Cortez spent
breaking the barrier.

30:48.366 --> 30:51.205
But airports are closed.
Will not fly away.

30:51.608 --> 30:54.439
Want a lock here.
Nothing can pass.

30:55.029 --> 30:56.957
What is he trying to do?

30:57.468 --> 30:58.758
Pro Going south on 95?

30:58.986 --> 31:01.565
He thinks he's going to
Mexico, but will not get.

31:01.566 --> 31:04.029
- Why do not you get a helicopter?
- The ZR-1 is faster

31:04.030 --> 31:06.074
than any helicopter.

31:06.075 --> 31:07.799
It's more than that.

31:07.986 --> 31:10.866
Cortez is the 3rd generation of leaders
cartel.

31:10.886 --> 31:14.595
He thinks he's untouchable.
Is how his mind works.

31:15.236 --> 31:16.646
He wants to be at the helm.

31:16.647 --> 31:18.585
- Literally.
- How so?

31:18.586 --> 31:21.583
Cortez pilot racing cars
since adolescence.

31:21.584 --> 31:23.917
Father built a clue him in Sinaloa.

31:24.018 --> 31:27.586
He flies on the professional circuit
South American with a nickname.

31:27.706 --> 31:30.701
I saw him riding.
He's very good.

31:37.396 --> 31:39.417
Silence. Silence!

31:42.876 --> 31:46.356
- Here is Bannister.
- Are you having a good day?

31:46.483 --> 31:47.783
Tues.

31:47.784 --> 31:50.578
This can only end in 2 ways.
And you know what?

31:50.579 --> 31:51.905
Glad to anyone.

31:51.906 --> 31:54.719
<i>With this girl alive or dead?</i>

31:54.720 --> 31:58.886
<i>Can I cut it into pieces
and send it by mail for you.</i>

31:58.887 --> 32:00.279
<i>Is that what you want?</i>

32:00.566 --> 32:03.033
've killed a federal agent,
Gabriel.

32:03.376 --> 32:06.816
If you kill one more, I guarantee that
not have nowhere to hide.

32:06.866 --> 32:12.377
<i>Listen, how will you explain to parents
she had come home in bags?</i>

32:14.366 --> 32:16.493
<i>Is how we will be John:</i>

32:16.583 --> 32:19.786
<i>Call your people back
and out of my way.</i>

32:19.787 --> 32:21.870
<i>Or his agent was already.</i>

32:22.019 --> 32:25.473
- Any option I like.
- Let me talk to her.

32:28.526 --> 32:33.548
<i>Sorry, John. I screwed up.
Sorry.</i>

32:34.316 --> 32:38.680
I'll get you this.
Okay? Do not worry.

32:38.766 --> 32:43.385
If you try to stop me,
many people will die needlessly.

32:43.466 --> 32:45.707
<i>You choose how you will.</i>

32:45.708 --> 32:49.614
Right now, I'm just a guy who left
for a spin.

32:54.936 --> 32:58.584
- Will not give it to explode.
- Shut the fuck up!

33:04.166 --> 33:07.470
- Yes?
- Ray, we are the home of Parson.

33:07.505 --> 33:09.514
<i>Found his body.</i>

33:09.686 --> 33:11.774
<i>He was murdered.</i>

33:22.807 --> 33:25.627
A positive identification:
ZR-1-gray metallic

33:25.628 --> 33:28.028
followed by U.S. Interstate-95.

33:30.516 --> 33:33.576
<i>We can see the hostage
in the vehicle.</i>

33:35.185 --> 33:37.152
- You are almost there, chief.
- Understood.

33:37.253 --> 33:39.474
Relax. We are ready this guy.

33:39.575 --> 33:43.033
<i>Not trust either.
Cortez can always surprise.</i>

33:43.166 --> 33:45.086
<i>Need to be alert.</i>

33:45.112 --> 33:48.579
And remind your men
who has a hostage in the car.

33:49.696 --> 33:52.661
Arriving at the Arizona border.
Should get soon.

33:53.137 --> 33:55.630
Understood.
Are all in position.

34:00.486 --> 34:03.135
5 minutes. Walk.

34:08.466 --> 34:12.708
Fix up.
Want you to have a good view of the show.

34:12.976 --> 34:14.456
What?

35:03.446 --> 35:05.350
Back!

35:53.316 --> 35:54.924
My God!

36:00.624 --> 36:02.785
<i>He went through all barriers.</i>

36:02.786 --> 36:04.365
<i>Looks like a war zone down there
.</i>

36:04.366 --> 36:06.036
<i>Has targeted several police.</i>

36:06.037 --> 36:07.772
Damn!

36:11.486 --> 36:12.986
I'm already on the way.

36:12.987 --> 36:15.187
And do not forget:
This is a crime scene.

36:15.188 --> 36:17.908
Not touch anything.

36:19.766 --> 36:21.416
Understood, sir.

36:26.986 --> 36:30.506
Is the following: we have a
broken window, ok?

36:30.507 --> 36:33.215
In my opinion,
was a robbery that went wrong.

36:33.377 --> 36:37.435
I wonder what made Parson:
He came and surprised them.

36:37.536 --> 36:39.168
It may have been that.

36:41.286 --> 36:44.222
Has anyone checked the tire marks?

36:44.386 --> 36:46.678
They came here first.

36:48.986 --> 36:51.052
- I'll check.
- Go with him.

36:51.142 --> 36:52.549
Yes, sir.

36:54.276 --> 36:57.169
- Show me the body.
- Right here.

37:00.981 --> 37:02.747
Oh, Jesus!

37:12.436 --> 37:14.533
No burn in drilling.

37:16.386 --> 37:18.967
The bullet went through him.

37:24.746 --> 37:27.216
There was a gun that did it.

37:32.966 --> 37:34.836
Know which way did they go?

37:35.936 --> 37:38.747
Direct pro canyon. Come.

37:50.556 --> 37:54.840
$ 3 million in an account in Switzerland as
combine.

37:56.326 --> 38:01.274
Know, in my country the police
say "gracias" after being paid.

38:06.166 --> 38:08.806
Has even driving like a maniac?

38:09.410 --> 38:12.174
I can stop pretending I
hostage now?

38:17.356 --> 38:19.454
Ooops! Sorry.

38:32.792 --> 38:34.284
What is this?

38:35.386 --> 38:38.042
- Adrenaline!
- What?

38:41.961 --> 38:45.095
Lost eye contact!
He just disappeared!

38:45.366 --> 38:49.023
- How? Give back!
- Let's look around.

39:20.546 --> 39:22.032
He's gone!

39:22.099 --> 39:24.375
How so "disappeared"?
Keep looking!

39:24.576 --> 39:27.500
Has to continue! Look! Find it!

39:30.086 --> 39:32.265
<i>We lost him. Keep looking.</i>

39:32.266 --> 39:33.866
Bastard!

39:51.336 --> 39:55.817
He killed out here, and then took the body
inside.

39:58.176 --> 40:00.149
How long he arrives at the border?

40:00.150 --> 40:03.055
That speed between 65 and 75 minutes.

40:03.366 --> 40:07.535
Shortcut that he is taking
canyon is most of the time.

40:07.586 --> 40:09.834
Can increase this to me, please
?

40:10.986 --> 40:13.361
The intercept point is here:
Los Algodones.

40:13.362 --> 40:15.466
I know the police chief
that border.

40:15.516 --> 40:17.046
It's kind of tough.

40:17.106 --> 40:19.543
And the passage
was reformed last year.

40:19.632 --> 40:23.507
Concrete walls pure
retractable steel barriers on the ground.

40:23.593 --> 40:24.708
Is a fortress.

40:24.870 --> 40:27.911
Cortez would not
behind a target without a plan of action.

40:27.954 --> 40:29.818
Whatever plan will be prepared.

40:29.819 --> 40:33.309
Email people to Algodones.
Reinforce passage.

40:33.486 --> 40:35.545
Right. And what do you think of this city?

40:35.657 --> 40:37.502
Somerton Junction.

40:37.888 --> 40:39.859
Not have an official pass.

40:39.986 --> 40:42.306
But the point closest to the road.

40:43.029 --> 40:44.533
Wait.

40:45.716 --> 40:47.941
The ravine is too deep to cross
.

40:47.942 --> 40:51.266
Is unlikely.
But let's not ignore that.

40:52.366 --> 40:54.271
I'll call the sheriff.

40:55.234 --> 40:57.652
Say that out of the way.

40:59.586 --> 41:01.686
- Hello?
- Sheriff Owens?

41:01.706 --> 41:04.435
- Myself. Who is this?
- John Bannister, the FBI.

41:04.436 --> 41:06.489
- We have a problem.
- Can talk.

41:06.490 --> 41:09.430
Has a fugitive following
to the Mexican border.

41:09.446 --> 41:12.680
There is a small chance he
try to cross it by Somerton Junction.

41:12.681 --> 41:17.305
Is more likely than not try, but
I will send a SWAT a precaution.

41:17.306 --> 41:19.581
No offense, but they only
can handle it.

41:19.582 --> 41:22.358
Cannot talk now. I got to go.

41:25.206 --> 41:26.632
What?

41:27.956 --> 41:29.557
I do not know.

41:29.786 --> 41:33.757
The FBI says a fugitive
may be coming our way.

41:34.197 --> 41:37.414
Seriously? So we have action!

41:38.966 --> 41:41.420
This is no coincidence.

41:41.828 --> 41:45.135
First the guys in the cafeteria,
now this.

41:45.536 --> 41:47.688
The two things are connected.

41:48.176 --> 41:50.713
We have to talk with Bailey and Torrance.

41:59.696 --> 42:01.337
Shit!

42:02.140 --> 42:03.988
What light is that?

42:04.586 --> 42:05.940
Will they?

42:05.941 --> 42:08.923
Think they are so stupid
to stay here?

42:10.516 --> 42:12.914
Devils. Give me the gun.

42:14.736 --> 42:16.818
Stop the car! Stop!

42:25.316 --> 42:27.084
What the fuck?

42:27.536 --> 42:29.501
<i>Bailey and Torrance,
where are you?</i>

42:32.536 --> 42:35.615
Follow some tire brands up the canyon
on the side south of the city.

42:35.616 --> 42:38.370
Has anyone here.
We are going to check the foot.

42:38.371 --> 42:41.865
Negative. Go back
immediately. Got it?

42:42.316 --> 42:44.080
Gimme that.

42:53.725 --> 42:58.049
Ray, have lights on.
Has something big going on here!

43:00.986 --> 43:03.231
Ray, are you listening?

43:04.121 --> 43:05.871
Ray, are you listening?

43:11.357 --> 43:12.869
Stop!

43:25.736 --> 43:27.519
Jerry, run!

43:39.436 --> 43:41.279
- Sarah!
- Go!

43:52.944 --> 43:55.226
<i>What the hell is happening here?</i>

43:57.606 --> 44:00.447
They're shooting at us!
Are many!

44:01.080 --> 44:02.816
<i>We're coming!</i>

44:18.838 --> 44:20.512
Night Vision.

44:25.100 --> 44:27.371
Lights out. Now.

44:28.636 --> 44:30.217
Shit!

44:39.967 --> 44:43.383
Jerry, are you legal?
Can you come here?

44:46.536 --> 44:48.210
I can!

44:49.102 --> 44:50.493
Wait!

46:04.753 --> 46:07.620
- Jerry is there! He was shot!
- I'll cover you!

46:07.621 --> 46:09.016
Ok!

46:13.306 --> 46:15.815
Use the missile launcher!

46:21.118 --> 46:23.766
Jerry, we got to go! Come on!

46:35.655 --> 46:37.282
Vai, vai, vai!

47:03.168 --> 47:06.566
- Is anyone following us?
- Negative, I'm not seeing headlights.

47:06.567 --> 47:07.989
Great.

47:08.415 --> 47:09.552
Are you okay?

47:09.553 --> 47:11.361
Oh, God, Jerry!
's Still bleeding.

47:11.362 --> 47:13.325
It's nothing serious.

47:13.326 --> 47:15.881
Find the wound and apply pressure.

47:18.536 --> 47:21.436
Sorry. 'S Alright, alright.

47:21.777 --> 47:25.730
Take care. Blood stains are difficult
out of uniform.

47:26.782 --> 47:29.913
Think I'm calling? Are you
vai even wash it after...

47:30.236 --> 47:32.188
we'll mend.

47:33.078 --> 47:35.875
Think Frank will be jealous if
see us like this?

47:35.876 --> 47:40.311
You can talk to your colleague
he is losing his time.

47:40.566 --> 47:42.545
I do not go to prison.

47:42.736 --> 47:44.979
Yeah, he likes you.

47:46.606 --> 47:49.325
Hang on, Jerry. Please.

47:49.584 --> 47:52.622
Jerry! Hang on, Jerry.

47:52.956 --> 47:54.822
Ray, run!

48:21.916 --> 48:23.503
Jerry...

48:38.930 --> 48:41.927
- Come on.
- Oh, Ray ..

48:46.676 --> 48:48.366
Ah, Jerry...

49:33.286 --> 49:34.830
Sarah!

49:36.161 --> 49:37.773
Sarah!

49:46.827 --> 49:49.404
Not believe he is dead.

49:53.526 --> 49:55.805
He was talking about you...

49:56.686 --> 49:59.387
just before he died.

50:00.300 --> 50:02.166
And what did he say?

50:04.636 --> 50:07.639
Asked me to go easy on you.

50:09.183 --> 50:11.791
That you're not so bad.

50:30.716 --> 50:32.635
As well "gave police work"?

50:32.738 --> 50:34.456
- What kind of work?
- Listen...

50:34.457 --> 50:36.441
will be ready on time?

50:36.442 --> 50:38.624
Yes, you will not have problem.

50:38.822 --> 50:41.236
I just hope
fulfill its mission.

50:41.237 --> 50:43.936
I do not care any more excuses.

50:45.170 --> 50:46.947
Shit!

50:49.006 --> 50:52.035
Bannister talking. How long will it take
the SWAT team?

50:52.136 --> 50:53.835
45 minutes. Why?

50:53.936 --> 50:55.236
<i>Because I need help.</i>

50:55.237 --> 50:57.778
Your prisoner is trying
to cross the border here.

50:57.779 --> 50:59.523
What are you talking about?
Hence it does not.

50:59.524 --> 51:00.824
<i>Are giving a way.</i>

51:00.825 --> 51:03.086
Because the canyon, in the southern part,
is very narrow.

51:03.138 --> 51:06.124
Has a full staff there with
military experience heavy weapons.

51:06.125 --> 51:08.691
They're building a bridge over the Mobile
canyon!

51:08.692 --> 51:11.975
- Really? You think?
- I know. I saw those guys.

51:11.976 --> 51:14.316
Exchanged shots with them!

51:14.527 --> 51:16.695
<i>Who the hell is this fugitive, eh?</i>

51:19.686 --> 51:21.609
- Gabriel Cortez.
- What?

51:21.610 --> 51:23.835
<i>And why did not you tell me this before
?</i>

51:23.836 --> 51:26.716
My cop would still be alive if I knew that
!

51:26.717 --> 51:29.636
Not have time to explain every detail
.

51:29.637 --> 51:31.873
Why not give a saucy to patrol?

51:31.874 --> 51:35.892
Look, I do not know you, nor am
and his subordinate!

51:39.796 --> 51:41.975
Motherfucker!

51:43.086 --> 51:45.527
Hung up on me.

51:45.572 --> 51:47.372
Sheriff psychotic.

51:47.516 --> 51:50.695
Phil, call the SWAT captain.
Now.

51:50.776 --> 51:54.554
And get me a map of Somerton.
I want to see something.

51:58.405 --> 52:00.509
- Mr.
- Captain, has a chance...

52:00.510 --> 52:03.416
of the Cortez for trying to cross
Somerton.

52:03.497 --> 52:06.335
<i>When you get there, if you feel
destroy a bridge.</i>

52:06.415 --> 52:07.990
Yes, sir.

52:18.108 --> 52:20.433
A movable bridge...

52:25.560 --> 52:28.712
SWAT is there front.
What will you do?

52:31.476 --> 52:34.280
Death does not arrive when you expect.

52:35.520 --> 52:37.776
Piloting a race car...

52:38.136 --> 52:39.656
or in a shootout...

52:42.936 --> 52:45.803
Death awaits in the kitchen when you lift
night

52:45.804 --> 52:47.843
to get a glass of milk.

52:53.206 --> 52:56.108
My niece,
the oldest of my sister,

52:56.109 --> 52:57.812
was a good girl.

52:57.936 --> 52:59.961
I practically raised her.

53:00.754 --> 53:03.365
Then one night,
I bumped into her in the kitchen

53:03.366 --> 53:05.166
me a gun.

53:07.586 --> 53:10.092
If she had not wavered, my brain would

53:10.136 --> 53:14.318
there scattered across the kitchen floor
and not hers.

53:28.798 --> 53:30.394
Shit!

53:57.886 --> 54:01.549
Do not try to see death coming, because
not see.

54:13.365 --> 54:15.491
SWAT will not arrive.

54:16.236 --> 54:17.978
We're on our own?

54:18.096 --> 54:21.236
So who is going to stop this guy
Cortez?

54:22.076 --> 54:25.327
This problem is the feds.
He was in their custody.

54:25.330 --> 54:29.217
They is the guy who lost.
Should not be our problem.

54:33.466 --> 54:35.095
Maybe not.

54:36.491 --> 54:40.755
But if it passes through our city,
is our problem, yes.

54:40.856 --> 54:46.170
But... We can close our eyes.
Let's do this.

54:48.405 --> 54:51.885
If we do,
is better playing off the badge.

54:51.886 --> 54:53.654
Ray, come on.

54:54.906 --> 54:56.548
Cannot.

55:04.000 --> 55:07.450
Jerry died because of that guy.

55:10.800 --> 55:14.742
Ray, you know me.
I'm not a coward.

55:14.850 --> 55:19.151
I'd love to pick a fight with those guys
by Jerry.

55:19.404 --> 55:24.025
But Cortez is much for us.
He has an army.

55:30.240 --> 55:31.592
Look,

55:32.020 --> 55:35.601
if you want to leave this,
's okay by me.

55:35.736 --> 55:37.935
I will not criticize them for that.

55:38.830 --> 55:43.791
But I will not let this guy
enter our city without fighting.

55:47.758 --> 55:50.445
I also took an oath, Ray.

55:51.150 --> 55:55.780
Ray, it seems you are needing help
.

55:56.950 --> 55:58.905
I can help you.

56:14.520 --> 56:17.722
Your aim is still good as it was?

56:19.220 --> 56:22.147
Military
memory lasts a long time.

56:22.900 --> 56:26.461
Frank, I've seen many
you start things and not finish.

56:26.478 --> 56:28.181
Jerry was my friend.

56:28.382 --> 56:30.913
I would never abandon my friends.

56:33.261 --> 56:35.150
Can release it.

56:37.490 --> 56:39.708
You will be my helper.

56:40.070 --> 56:42.079
I will not disappoint you.

56:51.979 --> 56:53.673
Okay, okay.

56:54.493 --> 56:57.826
Now we are four. Are you happy?

57:15.329 --> 57:16.877
Phil...

57:17.757 --> 57:20.536
want financial information from all
Division.

57:20.537 --> 57:22.915
Even mine. No exceptions.

57:23.860 --> 57:27.897
Cortez have someone here that
warned him about his transfer.

57:27.898 --> 57:30.385
I wonder who is. Right?

58:08.775 --> 58:10.331
Ray, I...

58:12.364 --> 58:14.576
I want to tell you something:

58:14.677 --> 58:17.797
When I was with Jerry
in the middle of shooting,

58:18.429 --> 58:20.458
I was terrified.

58:20.966 --> 58:25.281
I could not get my hands to stop shaking.

58:25.381 --> 58:27.238
Look, this is normal.

58:27.390 --> 58:30.254
Everyone is so
in the middle of a firelight.

58:37.084 --> 58:39.722
I'll tell you a secret:

58:42.773 --> 58:46.701
Probably I'm more afraid than you
this time.

58:47.083 --> 58:48.602
What?

58:49.640 --> 58:51.707
But why?

58:51.729 --> 58:54.804
Because I've seen a lot of blood and death.

58:55.829 --> 58:58.262
I know what's going to happen.

59:17.675 --> 59:20.276
Ask Washington to send
an image in real time

59:20.330 --> 59:22.809
the region around Somerton.

59:23.250 --> 59:24.607
If the sheriff is right,

59:24.660 --> 59:26.966
have 100 federal agents idly

59:26.967 --> 59:30.070
bordering Los Algodones
are blurring without reason.

59:30.181 --> 59:33.282
- What is the fastest way?
- A Challenger jet.

59:33.905 --> 59:35.316
Make.

59:36.510 --> 59:37.839
Ready?

59:38.240 --> 59:40.828
Yes, but let's face like everyone
firepower

59:40.847 --> 59:43.178
with a pair of shotguns?

59:43.462 --> 59:45.103
I have an idea.

59:52.490 --> 59:56.356
I have two conditions that must accept
before I do anything.

59:56.500 --> 01:00:00.060
- Sing it.
- I want to be a cop like Frank.

01:00:00.348 --> 01:00:02.800
Thus any damage caused to me or that I
cause,

01:00:02.863 --> 01:00:04.760
will be responsibility of the police force

01:00:04.761 --> 01:00:07.135
and Sheriff Somerton Junction.

01:00:11.940 --> 01:00:13.789
Put your hand here.

01:00:16.790 --> 01:00:18.865
I nominate this instant
Dinkum Lewis,

01:00:19.111 --> 01:00:21.304
to be assistant sheriff
from this day,

01:00:21.405 --> 01:00:23.637
or until their services
are no longer needed

01:00:23.638 --> 01:00:25.530
the people of Somerton Junction.

01:00:25.677 --> 01:00:27.639
- Witnesses?
- I witness.

01:00:32.526 --> 01:00:34.613
- What else?
- Huh?

01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:36.625
Second condition.

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.986
I want to take the "Georgette".

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:41.630
I'm the only one who knows how to use it.

01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:43.167
Okay. Come on.

01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:47.199
You can also use it, Ray
And you, Frank.

01:00:47.395 --> 01:00:49.161
- Thanks.
- Let's go.

01:00:54.481 --> 01:00:57.329
- Jesus Christ, Lewis!
- Caramba!

01:00:58.370 --> 01:01:01.443
What a beauty!
Where'd you get that?

01:01:01.446 --> 01:01:04.067
"Vicky"? She is my
killer-of-Nazis.

01:01:04.068 --> 01:01:06.447
Vickers Machine Gun 1939.

01:01:06.605 --> 01:01:08.661
Is my "bitch-doidinha."

01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:11.812
it cannot legally be used.

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:16.677
But I put back the missing pieces
and theoretically it works.

01:01:16.678 --> 01:01:20.494
Course this is between us and God.
Uncle Sam does not need to know.

01:01:20.705 --> 01:01:23.271
- Has more ammunition?
- Some cartridges.

01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:25.176
So bring everything you have.

01:02:02.378 --> 01:02:04.984
Did
think will fight in a Crusade?

01:02:05.819 --> 01:02:07.563
Never know.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:25.425
We meet in the main street
in 5 minutes.

01:02:25.426 --> 01:02:28.641
Cars also need to do the blocking.

01:02:28.642 --> 01:02:30.741
I drive the old "Henrietta" here.

01:02:30.742 --> 01:02:32.624
Why idiots
gives nicknames for everything?

01:02:32.625 --> 01:02:34.680
Only for things that I love.

01:02:36.150 --> 01:02:37.716
Come on.

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:51.128
Okay. I inform after landing.

01:02:53.243 --> 01:02:54.243
Upgrade me.

01:02:54.244 --> 01:02:57.339
Border patrol responded,
but it will take 1 hour to arrive.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:59.305
- And the National Guard?
- More time yet.

01:02:59.306 --> 01:03:01.829
- And the Army?
- Only authorizes the president.

01:03:01.830 --> 01:03:03.576
We only have 45 minutes.

01:03:20.194 --> 01:03:23.861
Cortez will have to go through
main street to get to the canyon.

01:03:23.896 --> 01:03:26.265
The only other option is
by Alzamora St.

01:03:26.266 --> 01:03:29.204
Torrance, vai with Frank and Lewis
and lock it.

01:03:29.305 --> 01:03:31.370
"Figue"
and I'll warn civilians.

01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:32.871
Understood.

01:03:35.450 --> 01:03:37.296
- Hi, Ray.
- Listen, my friends...

01:03:37.546 --> 01:03:39.853
a fugitive
is coming to our city.

01:03:40.563 --> 01:03:41.989
Is very dangerous to stay here.

01:03:41.990 --> 01:03:43.951
I want everyone go home!

01:03:48.655 --> 01:03:50.797
You heard what I said?

01:03:53.401 --> 01:03:56.759
- Just ask the coffee!
- It's for safety of you.

01:03:56.936 --> 01:04:00.130
You are talking to a 72 year old
with high cholesterol,

01:04:00.185 --> 01:04:02.401
eating bacon and cheddar omelette with.

01:04:02.671 --> 01:04:05.146
You really think I'm afraid of death?

01:04:06.292 --> 01:04:09.839
Not look at me.
I asked the same thing.

01:04:11.572 --> 01:04:13.446
Already started preparing.

01:04:14.943 --> 01:04:17.898
- Where's Christie?
- Was behind milk.

01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:24.683
So stay away from windows,
okay?

01:04:25.259 --> 01:04:29.356
- Stay away from windows.
- Right. No windows.

01:04:31.117 --> 01:04:33.457
So, what do we do?

01:04:34.048 --> 01:04:36.034
Is: put your truck back there

01:04:36.035 --> 01:04:38.547
and find more people to use cars.

01:04:39.030 --> 01:04:42.241
- I have a better idea.
- Need something bigger.

01:04:42.787 --> 01:04:46.280
Maybe three on this side.
Should be enough.

01:04:48.812 --> 01:04:50.149
Hey!

01:04:50.636 --> 01:04:52.717
- What will you do?
- Clear!

01:04:52.867 --> 01:04:54.365
Not do that!
E electrical wires?

01:04:54.494 --> 01:04:57.859
Are phone and cable TV!
Electricity is back there!

01:04:57.860 --> 01:05:00.333
That's not what I'm talking about!
If you cut the pole

01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:02.933
he'll be hanging only by the wires
!

01:05:10.874 --> 01:05:14.094
"Geronimo!" "Geronimo!"

01:05:20.747 --> 01:05:22.159
Perfect!

01:05:22.964 --> 01:05:24.660
Let's put the cars here.

01:05:25.172 --> 01:05:27.119
What crap!

01:05:29.250 --> 01:05:30.823
Caramba!

01:05:32.442 --> 01:05:34.739
- John, you better look at it.
- What is it?

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:36.575
Satellite image
National Security.

01:05:36.576 --> 01:05:39.589
This is a live picture of the canyon
Somerton south of Junction.

01:05:39.784 --> 01:05:41.084
Check it out.

01:05:41.158 --> 01:05:42.958
- It's a bridge.
- Is.

01:05:43.980 --> 01:05:45.421
Not believe.

01:05:46.802 --> 01:05:49.617
The sheriff was right.
Who is he?

01:05:51.289 --> 01:05:53.770
In 1988, came to LAPD

01:05:53.771 --> 01:05:55.862
trained with the elite tactical team
.

01:05:55.940 --> 01:05:57.973
Narcotics worked in 5 years, and then left
.

01:05:58.272 --> 01:05:59.272
Why?

01:05:59.273 --> 01:06:02.117
He took a group that moved
half a ton of cocaine.

01:06:02.950 --> 01:06:06.175
Won a medal for bravery, but
took 5 shots.

01:06:06.425 --> 01:06:09.059
He survived, but another 7
not police.

01:06:09.294 --> 01:06:11.072
Was the last straw pro Owens.

01:06:11.107 --> 01:06:13.089
He saw much bloodshed
and wanted to leave.

01:06:13.121 --> 01:06:15.596
Somerton was to play sheriff.

01:06:19.786 --> 01:06:21.262
Thanks.

01:06:23.570 --> 01:06:24.940
Yeah, we need two more.

01:06:25.052 --> 01:06:27.553
Oh my God!
What are you doing now, Dinkum?

01:06:27.648 --> 01:06:29.678
Once you crazy?

01:06:29.740 --> 01:06:32.495
Easy there! Almost there!

01:06:33.961 --> 01:06:35.650
Dinkum, do not!

01:06:38.594 --> 01:06:40.882
Dinkum! Dinkum! You okay?

01:06:41.743 --> 01:06:44.346
Oh, my God! You okay?

01:06:46.543 --> 01:06:48.016
Henrietta!

01:06:49.624 --> 01:06:51.239
Worked!

01:06:53.363 --> 01:06:56.244
Good work police. Good job.

01:07:07.730 --> 01:07:10.035
Ray, we need something bigger.

01:07:11.134 --> 01:07:12.529
I have an idea.

01:07:12.655 --> 01:07:14.913
- Torrance.
- The street is blocked.

01:07:15.030 --> 01:07:18.291
Great. Speech and pro Dinkum Martinez
find me in the schoolyard.

01:07:18.500 --> 01:07:22.259
And I want you on the roof of the old hotel
to be my lookout.

01:07:22.765 --> 01:07:26.044
Figue, go to the southern part
check if the buildings are empty.

01:07:26.157 --> 01:07:28.057
- I'll be right back.
- I'm going.

01:07:46.666 --> 01:07:48.975
Come "kicking a dead horse."

01:08:05.815 --> 01:08:07.446
Ai, caramba!

01:08:25.737 --> 01:08:28.165
You guys
on Main Street travelling south.

01:08:28.265 --> 01:08:30.576
<i>Not the face.
Wait till we get there.</i>

01:08:30.676 --> 01:08:32.215
Understood, Ray.

01:08:51.215 --> 01:08:53.060
But that hell is that?

01:08:54.723 --> 01:08:56.750
This will be fun!

01:08:57.662 --> 01:09:00.312
I need two men on the left ...

01:09:01.511 --> 01:09:03.194
and 2 on the right.

01:09:05.331 --> 01:09:08.526
You can shoot anything that moves
.

01:09:08.886 --> 01:09:12.185
If you do not move, shoot it anyway
!

01:09:14.613 --> 01:09:19.337
And when we finish, we'll burn this place
!

01:09:34.889 --> 01:09:37.546
- Christie! Christie!
- By God, Figue!

01:09:37.612 --> 01:09:39.443
Christie, you got to get out of here now
!

01:09:39.478 --> 01:09:42.675
What is happening?
Why are these cars so?

01:09:42.866 --> 01:09:44.857
Look at that ass.

01:09:47.370 --> 01:09:49.089
Christie,
you have to get out of the street!

01:09:49.090 --> 01:09:50.883
Why is hidden behind the car?

01:09:50.884 --> 01:09:53.237
This one is my kind of woman.

01:09:54.707 --> 01:09:56.221
Damn!

01:10:01.390 --> 01:10:02.722
Vai! Vai!

01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:04.164
Run!

01:10:04.665 --> 01:10:06.781
Come! Get down!

01:10:08.157 --> 01:10:09.543
How is it? Shoot!

01:10:09.544 --> 01:10:11.814
Restaurant...
pro Vai restaurant!

01:10:18.609 --> 01:10:19.709
Shit!

01:10:19.767 --> 01:10:21.558
Is the best that shoots?

01:10:37.161 --> 01:10:40.332
Look at the sucker big hat.

01:10:40.513 --> 01:10:43.471
This is getting boring.
Bring the missile launchers!

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:46.633
Oh, damn. Damn!

01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:52.477
This . Let's give him a souvenir
.

01:10:55.689 --> 01:10:57.483
Oh, shit!

01:11:37.379 --> 01:11:38.957
Get him!

01:11:40.624 --> 01:11:42.496
- Damn!
- Figue!

01:11:46.061 --> 01:11:47.579
All clear. Vai.

01:12:02.429 --> 01:12:04.366
What is happening?

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:09.623
- Torrance, okay?
- I'm, Ray.

01:12:11.141 --> 01:12:12.958
But hit the Figue.

01:12:50.165 --> 01:12:52.005
What is this shit?

01:13:33.246 --> 01:13:35.312
Welcome to Somerton Junction.

01:13:38.795 --> 01:13:40.830
Beautiful shots, sheriff.

01:13:47.039 --> 01:13:49.426
Placed in position this bus!

01:13:51.117 --> 01:13:54.174
- Hurry!
- Coming! Let's do this!

01:13:58.610 --> 01:14:00.210
Hurry up!

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:12.919
We are positioned!

01:14:16.649 --> 01:14:19.254
Torrance!
From where the shots are coming?

01:14:21.251 --> 01:14:23.641
Behind you!
The side of the restaurant!

01:14:23.955 --> 01:14:26.175
- Give me cover!
- "Linger"!

01:14:42.997 --> 01:14:44.769
How are you, sheriff?

01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:47.746
Old.

01:14:47.820 --> 01:14:49.869
No, you still have very ahead.

01:14:50.533 --> 01:14:52.511
Oh my God, Sheriff!
They hit you!

01:14:52.673 --> 01:14:56.095
- Somebody help him!
- Do not worry, it's only glass.

01:14:59.387 --> 01:15:01.277
Where is the pro ladder roof?

01:15:01.378 --> 01:15:02.844
Ali

01:15:42.702 --> 01:15:45.085

I have to help her!

01:15:45.086 --> 01:15:48.284
- Give me the radio! The radio!
- We have no radio!

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.308
Never had one!

01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:54.232
- Cover me!
- Okay!

01:15:57.480 --> 01:15:58.991
What will he do?

01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:51.720
Sarah!

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.772
That means I'm forgiven?

01:17:05.085 --> 01:17:07.214
Yeah, probably.

01:17:11.243 --> 01:17:13.458
Damn! I'm out of action!

01:17:20.257 --> 01:17:22.176
Damn! Always with me!

01:17:29.275 --> 01:17:30.775
Shit!

01:17:41.474 --> 01:17:43.188
Jesus!

01:17:50.855 --> 01:17:52.680
Motherfuckers!

01:18:01.835 --> 01:18:05.105

- Shut up, Grandma.

01:18:16.860 --> 01:18:19.532
- Mrs. Salazar!

Ends soon with them, Ray!

01:18:28.015 --> 01:18:29.447
Right.

01:18:36.290 --> 01:18:38.659
- Figue?
- Lewis! What are you doing?

01:18:38.660 --> 01:18:40.260
Figue is right there!

01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:01.360

01:19:01.458 --> 01:19:04.097

01:19:08.570 --> 01:19:09.925
Come. I'll help you.

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:12.009
I'll help you.

01:19:15.285 --> 01:19:16.948
Come.

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:31.189
You were doing out there?

01:19:31.268 --> 01:19:33.799
- I'm a cop.
- Be quiet.

01:19:52.601 --> 01:19:55.012
Hey! I'm here!

01:19:59.813 --> 01:20:01.869
You motherfucker!

01:20:03.010 --> 01:20:05.181
Come! Shoot!

01:20:09.366 --> 01:20:11.661
Where are you?

01:20:13.390 --> 01:20:16.317
His mice. Want to play?

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:18.533
I love playing.

01:20:20.862 --> 01:20:22.143
Okay.

01:20:23.907 --> 01:20:25.622
Bag!

01:21:13.042 --> 01:21:14.663
Drop that gun.

01:21:22.375 --> 01:21:24.431
Who are you, huh?

01:21:31.495 --> 01:21:33.735
I'm the sheriff.

01:21:56.425 --> 01:21:57.876
<i>'Ve got.</i>

01:21:58.708 --> 01:22:00.127
<i>You hear me?</i>

01:22:00.868 --> 01:22:02.364
<i>Ready me.</i>

01:22:02.855 --> 01:22:04.612
We'll.

01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:53.520
You are very good at evasive, no?

01:22:54.890 --> 01:22:57.958
You are very beautiful,
agent Richards.

01:23:04.110 --> 01:23:08.112
And nothing would please me more...

01:23:10.884 --> 01:23:13.078
that show you...

01:23:13.574 --> 01:23:16.981
how good I am.

01:23:22.214 --> 01:23:26.192
But as you should still
playing the role of hostage

01:23:26.393 --> 01:23:29.841
consider it a parting gift.

01:23:34.210 --> 01:23:36.138
What do you mean?

01:23:59.904 --> 01:24:01.701
What the fuck...

01:24:10.890 --> 01:24:13.918
If you want to play, then
let's play!

01:24:36.509 --> 01:24:38.368
And now?

01:26:47.927 --> 01:26:49.715
You motherfucker!

01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.239
I'll kill you!

01:27:09.190 --> 01:27:10.790
Shit!

01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:26.035
You've ruined my car.

01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:29.443
And you just with my day off.

01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:34.110
You know, Sheriff?

01:29:34.284 --> 01:29:37.849
You just need to let me cross the border
.

01:29:40.010 --> 01:29:43.988
12,000 Mexicans crossing
every single day.

01:29:44.190 --> 01:29:46.919
Should not care if a revisit.

01:29:48.040 --> 01:29:49.224
What do you say?

01:29:49.225 --> 01:29:52.532
You're a disgrace to
immigrants.

01:29:56.444 --> 01:29:58.204
Okay.

01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:01.669
So let's discuss
my deportation. Let?

01:30:04.510 --> 01:30:06.467
Carlos, a moment.

01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:11.074
This is my personal banker.
Just tell him the account number.

01:30:11.075 --> 01:30:13.649
You will
5 million dollars richer.

01:30:13.650 --> 01:30:15.918
And we'll leave as friends.

01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:28.017
10 million.

01:30:34.610 --> 01:30:38.035
Place them, or I'll put them.

01:30:44.230 --> 01:30:46.647
Maybe another time.

01:30:50.905 --> 01:30:53.445
His time has passed, Grandpa.

01:30:53.829 --> 01:30:56.059
And mine is just beginning.

01:31:07.625 --> 01:31:09.591
Started playing.

01:32:08.440 --> 01:32:11.297
Should have taken the money, Grandpa.

01:33:33.021 --> 01:33:35.744
Okay! Okay!

01:33:37.690 --> 01:33:42.506
20 million!
20 million to do that overlook!

01:33:43.540 --> 01:33:47.821
- My honour is not for sale.
- Fuck your honour!

01:34:20.890 --> 01:34:22.854
You stuck.

01:34:47.410 --> 01:34:49.951
Here comes the cavalry.

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:56.079
- John Bannister, FBI.
- Glad you came.

01:34:58.401 --> 01:34:59.889
What happened here?
Where's Cortez?

01:34:59.890 --> 01:35:02.489
The sheriff was after him.
I'm more worried about him

01:35:02.490 --> 01:35:04.652
than with Cortez.

01:35:06.640 --> 01:35:09.249
Is... You two are lucky.

01:35:27.010 --> 01:35:28.948
Check it out.

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:31.603
Excuse.

01:35:31.990 --> 01:35:33.503
Excuse.

01:35:37.870 --> 01:35:41.389
The last time, this time the thing
turned against you.

01:35:41.490 --> 01:35:43.314
Botem him there.

01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:52.678
John!

01:35:52.960 --> 01:35:54.605
Richards!

01:35:54.960 --> 01:35:58.631
- Are you okay?
- I am. I'm cool.

01:35:58.810 --> 01:36:01.637
I'm sorry, John.
He would kill me.

01:36:02.310 --> 01:36:04.517
It's so good to see you!

01:36:04.590 --> 01:36:08.613
Is. I'm glad you're alive.
Very happy.

01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:15.200
Because now have the pleasure of
hold it personally.

01:36:17.690 --> 01:36:20.955
Discovered that you were
partners in the drug business.

01:36:21.870 --> 01:36:26.390
And for your information, account in
Switzerland is no longer secret as it was.

01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:28.077
Let.

01:36:35.690 --> 01:36:37.255
Shit!

01:36:37.410 --> 01:36:40.140
That's why I shot him!

01:36:41.690 --> 01:36:44.613
I can walk!
Just because I was wounded in combat

01:36:44.614 --> 01:36:46.989
not mean I cannot walk any more
.

01:36:47.090 --> 01:36:49.689
Not true, Ray?
Martinez, Torrance?

01:36:49.690 --> 01:36:51.600
I can walk!

01:36:52.130 --> 01:36:55.373
Christie But if you want to help me, I let
.

01:36:56.570 --> 01:36:59.270
- Thank you, darling.
- It was a pleasure, Lewis.

01:37:01.490 --> 01:37:03.014
Figue!

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:05.771
Figue!

01:37:06.290 --> 01:37:09.582
Sorry! Sorry!
Let me see, let me see.

01:37:10.781 --> 01:37:14.795
- Was a 50 calibre!
- And very painful!

01:37:15.490 --> 01:37:19.715
- Look at this. And you?
- I'm fine.

01:37:20.582 --> 01:37:23.355
Oh, come on.
Is a Balinha anything.

01:37:23.579 --> 01:37:26.464
We do report and leave, right?

01:37:29.290 --> 01:37:30.983
Sorry.

01:37:31.110 --> 01:37:34.378
I completely underestimated you
sheriff.

01:37:36.090 --> 01:37:37.910
