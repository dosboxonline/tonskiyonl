00:50.625 --> 00:52.000
[electronic trilling]

00:52.666 --> 00:54.958
[in alien language]
We shall miss your conversation

00:55.041 --> 00:56.958
on the rest of our voyage, Dr. Afriel.

00:57.458 --> 00:58.875
[in English] And I yours.

00:58.958 --> 01:03.000
Our exchange of information
has been extremely valuable to me.

01:03.083 --> 01:05.541
[in alien language]
Humanity is the kind of race

01:05.625 --> 01:07.458
we enjoy doing business with.

01:07.541 --> 01:09.291
Young, eager, flexible.

01:09.375 --> 01:12.708
But we do not understand
the profit you seek in studying the swarm.

01:12.791 --> 01:16.250
They are merely well-organized animals.

01:16.333 --> 01:20.125
[in English] Hmm.
Well, we humans learn wherever we can.

01:21.333 --> 01:22.583
[alien] Dr. Afriel.

01:23.416 --> 01:24.958
[electronic trilling]

01:26.000 --> 01:31.708
Per our transit contract,
we shall return in 600 of your days.

01:37.666 --> 01:39.125

02:07.375 --> 02:08.541
[rumbling]

02:11.791 --> 02:14.208
[creatures trilling, warbling]

02:17.500 --> 02:19.000
[woman in English] Dr. Afriel.

02:20.250 --> 02:21.125
Welcome.

02:21.708 --> 02:24.750
Dr. Mirny. An honor to meet you.

02:25.833 --> 02:27.166
And I you.

02:27.250 --> 02:29.208
It's good to see another human face.

02:29.708 --> 02:32.166
And please, call me Galina.

02:32.250 --> 02:33.083
[creature trilling]

02:33.166 --> 02:35.375
-[groans] What?
-Don't be alarmed.

02:36.083 --> 02:38.291
It will convey your pheromones
to the queen.

02:40.166 --> 02:43.041
Otherwise, you might be considered
an invader and killed.

02:45.583 --> 02:49.125
I followed your study of the Swarm
with tremendous interest, Doctor.

02:49.208 --> 02:52.250
But I had no idea you'd learned
to communicate with them.

02:52.333 --> 02:54.041
Not exactly.

02:54.125 --> 02:55.041
[squelching]

02:55.125 --> 02:57.916
[Galina] I found
no Swarm castes that use language,

02:58.000 --> 03:00.458
but several symbiote species still do.

03:00.958 --> 03:03.708
I call these springtails.

03:03.791 --> 03:06.125
I believe
they were once a spacefaring race

03:06.208 --> 03:09.500
who discovered the Swarm
and were absorbed by it.

03:10.000 --> 03:12.625
But now they are
little more than parasitic savages.

03:18.458 --> 03:21.375
So far,
I've identified 15 unique symbiotic aliens

03:21.458 --> 03:25.208
living among the hundreds
of specialized castes native to the Swarm.

03:30.791 --> 03:34.916
Various strains of nutrient-rich fungi
are the hive's main food source.

03:35.833 --> 03:38.958
Since our basic biochemistry is similar,
it's perfectly edible.

03:41.666 --> 03:43.666
[creatures trilling]

03:45.791 --> 03:48.041
[creature clicking]

03:48.125 --> 03:51.750
I've learned to solicit food
with a pattern of reflex tapping.

03:52.250 --> 03:53.291
[tapping]

03:53.375 --> 03:55.375
Fermentation in the worker's gut…

03:55.458 --> 03:57.208
[gurgling, retching]

03:57.291 --> 03:58.666
…adds nutritional value.

03:59.833 --> 04:01.250
Makes it taste better too.

04:05.750 --> 04:07.875
Mmm. It's wonderful. [gulps]

04:07.958 --> 04:09.958
[creature lowing]

04:12.000 --> 04:13.041
Tunneler.

04:14.958 --> 04:16.875
It can take us further into the Nest.

04:19.250 --> 04:20.458
[Afriel exhales sharply]

04:20.541 --> 04:21.541
[grunts]

04:22.166 --> 04:24.166
[tunneler lowing]

04:26.458 --> 04:28.458
[creatures trilling]

04:42.416 --> 04:43.416
The queen.

04:43.500 --> 04:45.208
[ethereal music swelling]

04:45.291 --> 04:46.750
[Galina] Heart of the Nest.

04:50.416 --> 04:52.625
Whatever caste of worker is needed,

04:53.291 --> 04:54.875
she can create it.

04:55.625 --> 04:59.625
The entire Nest is a wonder
of genetic automation.

05:01.458 --> 05:04.416
It is truly amazing.

05:06.166 --> 05:07.125
[creature clatters]

05:08.500 --> 05:11.000
[Galina] Warrior caste. Very deadly.

05:11.083 --> 05:12.458
[tense music playing]

05:13.041 --> 05:14.458
[creatures warbling]

05:14.541 --> 05:17.541
[Galina] But only if you mean harm
to the queen and her eggs.

05:24.458 --> 05:28.333
Dr. Afriel, I think it's time
you told me exactly why you're here.

05:29.916 --> 05:31.166
As you've discovered,

05:31.250 --> 05:34.000
the Swarm
is a near-perfect organic system.

05:35.041 --> 05:39.875
With a resource like this, we can bring
order to the chaos of human expansion.

05:40.375 --> 05:42.291
We must harness its power.

05:42.791 --> 05:44.708
Exploit it, you mean.

05:46.291 --> 05:48.458
If order is what you want,

05:49.375 --> 05:50.916
look around.

05:51.000 --> 05:54.958
It's always warm, it smells good,
and there's plenty of food.

05:55.458 --> 06:00.500
This Nest has been here
for millions of years.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.916
Who will remember humanity
in even a thousand?

06:05.333 --> 06:08.000
Even though I won't live
to see our race triumph,

06:08.083 --> 06:10.541
it's enough that I can foresee that day.

06:11.958 --> 06:13.083
Arrogance.

06:13.166 --> 06:15.000
[tense music playing]

06:18.875 --> 06:21.708
These creatures
are primordially innocent, Doctor.

06:21.791 --> 06:25.500
They should never become pawns
in some power struggle light-years away.

06:26.625 --> 06:29.958
[Afriel] But we only need
the genetic information from one egg.

06:30.041 --> 06:32.125
With that, we can grow our own queen.

06:32.625 --> 06:35.166
Her offspring will build a new nest.

06:35.250 --> 06:36.416
They would be useless

06:36.500 --> 06:39.000
without the Nest's pheromones
to control them.

06:39.083 --> 06:41.125
Mm. Artificial vein.

06:41.208 --> 06:43.333
This slipped past the Investor quarantine.

06:43.416 --> 06:47.041
Inside is a selection
of the Swarm pheromones we synthesized

06:47.125 --> 06:48.583
based on your samples.

06:49.125 --> 06:52.416
If these work,
we could control millions of workers.

06:52.500 --> 06:53.708
Armies of warriors.

06:53.791 --> 06:57.000
-You are planning to breed a slave race.
-We could--

06:57.666 --> 07:00.541
You said yourself, they aren't sentient.

07:00.625 --> 07:02.416
They're organic machines.

07:02.500 --> 07:07.000
It's not as if they'd be staring up
at the stars pining for their freedom.

07:08.666 --> 07:09.708
[inhales deeply]

07:09.791 --> 07:10.875
It's true.

07:12.166 --> 07:15.375
Whether they work for us or the Swarm
will make no difference to them.

07:16.041 --> 07:19.250
And that is the beauty
of the idea, Doctor.

07:23.166 --> 07:24.041
[sighs]

07:24.875 --> 07:28.416
As long as no harm comes to the Nest…

07:30.541 --> 07:31.458
I'll help you.

07:32.708 --> 07:34.166
[squelching]

07:34.250 --> 07:35.750
[suspenseful music playing]

07:39.791 --> 07:41.916
[Galina] We'll need to test
the synthesized pheromones

07:42.000 --> 07:43.666
with a series of trials.

07:43.750 --> 07:44.875
[creature trilling]

07:44.958 --> 07:48.291
[Galina] First vial contains
the most basic pheromonal commands.

07:49.166 --> 07:50.958
A simple grouping stimulus.

07:52.916 --> 07:54.625
But to work most effectively,

07:54.708 --> 07:57.666
the pheromones need to be combined
in a chemical program.

07:58.166 --> 07:59.833
Gather, then dig.

08:00.333 --> 08:02.625
Grow food here, then harvest.

08:04.041 --> 08:07.666
-Or retrieve one fertilized egg.
-[creature warbling]

08:16.041 --> 08:18.041
[ethereal music playing]

08:38.375 --> 08:41.458
[Galina] We humans
are not so very different.

08:43.083 --> 08:46.125
Adrift on ancient chemical tides.

08:47.375 --> 08:51.250
Submerged in the warm ebb and flow

08:52.166 --> 08:53.000
of life.

Galina?

11:15.708 --> 11:16.958
[gasping]

11:18.875 --> 11:21.083
[Galina] I have no name,

11:22.041 --> 11:24.125
but you may address me as…

11:24.208 --> 11:25.291
[squelching]

11:25.375 --> 11:26.416
…Swarm.

11:27.583 --> 11:29.083
[sinister music playing]

11:32.541 --> 11:34.750
[heaves, retches]

11:34.833 --> 11:36.625
[Swarm] I am one of its castes.

11:37.500 --> 11:39.791
My specialty is intelligence.

11:39.875 --> 11:42.125
We… we mean you no harm.

11:42.666 --> 11:44.416
We seek only knowledge and--

11:44.500 --> 11:47.250
[Swarm] You sought to breed us.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.208
Use us.

11:50.041 --> 11:52.333
But your crude experiments

11:52.916 --> 11:55.583
triggered certain genetic protocols,

11:55.666 --> 11:58.333
and I was born.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.666
I am only a few weeks old,

12:02.750 --> 12:06.666
but I have millions of years
of racial memory.

12:06.750 --> 12:10.125
You are clearly an intelligent being.

12:10.208 --> 12:12.000
Surely we can find a way to--

12:12.083 --> 12:14.583
Please, Doctor, I'm just a tool.

12:14.666 --> 12:15.791
[breathes raggedly]

12:15.875 --> 12:21.375
One the Swarm has used to deal
with threats like yours many times.

12:22.291 --> 12:25.291
Through her memories,
I understand your race.

12:25.791 --> 12:27.791
An especially vigorous one.

12:27.875 --> 12:29.958
I expect they could be here,

12:30.041 --> 12:33.333
competing with us
within a few hundred years.

12:34.083 --> 12:36.083
Hmm. It will be sooner.

12:36.166 --> 12:37.375
Perhaps.

12:38.250 --> 12:41.333
But on the timescale the Swarm operates,

12:41.416 --> 12:43.625
your race will soon be gone.

12:45.000 --> 12:47.958
If… if you intend to destroy us, we will--

12:48.041 --> 12:49.625
[yelling, choking]

12:49.708 --> 12:52.625
Most likely, you'll destroy yourselves.

12:53.541 --> 12:55.625
In… intelligence…

12:55.708 --> 12:56.541
[inhales deeply]

12:56.625 --> 12:58.791
…is not a winning survival trait.

12:58.875 --> 13:00.875
[exhales, breathes heavily]

13:01.708 --> 13:06.166
Consider the scavenger
feeding on your vomit.

13:07.000 --> 13:08.666
Two million years ago,

13:09.250 --> 13:12.583
its ancestors made the galaxy tremble.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.458
When they attacked the Swarm,

13:15.541 --> 13:20.125
we bred smarter, tougher versions
of their own race to fight them.

13:21.333 --> 13:24.083
Our nests were the only world
they'd known,

13:24.166 --> 13:27.208
and they fought with a fury
and inventiveness

13:27.708 --> 13:29.375
we never could have matched.

13:30.958 --> 13:32.625
It is an excellent strategy.

13:33.375 --> 13:36.166
And the two of you
make a perfect breeding pair.

13:37.458 --> 13:40.000
I would never betray my race.

13:40.083 --> 13:41.250
I will kill myself.

13:41.958 --> 13:47.083
In which case, I would simply clone you
and raise the children myself.

13:47.750 --> 13:48.583
Bothersome.

13:50.416 --> 13:52.291
And so I offer you a choice.

13:53.083 --> 13:57.708
Remain an intelligent living being or…

13:57.791 --> 13:59.375
[gasps, moans]

13:59.458 --> 14:00.375
[squelching]

14:02.791 --> 14:05.375

[gasping, retching]

14:10.416 --> 14:11.791
[sighs, chuckles]

14:13.375 --> 14:14.208
So,

14:15.625 --> 14:19.333
do you accept my offer, Doctor?

14:20.958 --> 14:25.666
I accept your challenge.

14:26.791 --> 14:28.875
We won't become parasites.

14:28.958 --> 14:31.291
Humans are different.

14:32.208 --> 14:34.541
Of course you are.

14:36.541 --> 14:38.541
[squelching]

14:38.625 --> 14:41.500
I'm glad I won't have to absorb you.

14:43.416 --> 14:44.625
I would have missed

14:45.500 --> 14:46.875
your conversation.

14:48.791 --> 14:50.166
[music fades]

14:55.000 --> 14:56.541
