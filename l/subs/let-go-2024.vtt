00:08.680 --> 00:11.120
<i>Communication is everything.</i>

00:15.280 --> 00:16.680
<i>Validating each other.</i>

00:18.160 --> 00:20.000
<i>Sharing concerns,</i>

00:21.320 --> 00:24.600
<i>fears, sorrow, and joy.</i>

00:25.800 --> 00:28.120
It's very common, if you're not careful,

00:28.200 --> 00:31.440
to lose the spark in a relationship,
just like that.

00:31.520 --> 00:33.920
<i>You take each other for granted.</i>

00:34.640 --> 00:37.720
-
<i>You can stop noticing each other.</i>

00:37.800 --> 00:40.040
Maximum of five minutes waiting, please.

00:40.120 --> 00:42.280
- Oh, I'm just picking up here.
- Make it quick.

00:42.360 --> 00:43.200
Yeah.

00:43.720 --> 00:45.120
<i>You stop listening.</i>

00:46.160 --> 00:49.320
<i>But you need to think back</i>

00:50.600 --> 00:52.600
<i>to the day you first met.</i>

00:54.520 --> 00:57.640
So what was the reason that made you want…

00:57.720 --> 00:59.760
want to be a couple?

00:59.840 --> 01:01.720
Registration closes today.

01:02.240 --> 01:04.560
<i>It's so important to remember that.</i>

01:04.640 --> 01:07.000
- <i>We only have one life.</i>
- Great.

01:07.080 --> 01:08.600
<i>And it goes so fast.</i>

01:09.280 --> 01:11.640
<i>- Sometimes a bit too fast.</i>
- Very nice.

01:11.720 --> 01:13.760
<i>But if you live life to the fullest…</i>

01:13.840 --> 01:16.200
Anna, make sure
your mum signs this.

01:16.280 --> 01:17.440
<i>…and decide to…</i>

01:17.520 --> 01:18.520
Yes.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.480
…simply let go…

01:21.560 --> 01:23.680
- Let go!
No way!

01:23.760 --> 01:26.960
<i>…then life can be truly fantastic.</i>

01:31.920 --> 01:36.280
<i>Of course, unexpected things</i>
<i>happen in life to everyone.</i>

01:36.360 --> 01:38.560
<i>- That's the way it is.</i>
- Hi, honey.

01:38.640 --> 01:41.320
<i>But maybe</i>
<i>you don't have to be afraid of that.</i>

01:41.400 --> 01:42.440
Hey.

01:43.680 --> 01:45.440
- Are you angry?
No.

01:45.520 --> 01:48.320
So you just felt like kicking a wall, huh?

01:48.400 --> 01:49.400
Mmm.

01:50.400 --> 01:51.640
Sure. Well, that's all right.

01:55.720 --> 01:58.160
- Shall we go home?
Mmm-hmm.

01:58.840 --> 02:01.240
Okay. Now come here.

02:03.880 --> 02:07.080
Dinner's ready! Dinner's ready!

02:07.160 --> 02:09.440
Yes! I heard you the first time!

02:09.520 --> 02:10.520
All right.

02:11.360 --> 02:12.480
Fuck's sake.

02:13.200 --> 02:16.880
<i>Life is about sharing those small,</i>
<i>everyday moments.</i>

02:16.960 --> 02:21.760
<i>Worries, fears,</i>
<i>sorrow, but above all, joy.</i>

02:21.840 --> 02:23.520
<i>But dinner isn't ready.</i>

02:23.600 --> 02:26.440
Yes, dinner is ready.
We're gonna have pasta…

02:26.520 --> 02:28.920
whenever your dad decides to show up.

02:30.640 --> 02:33.760
<i>But if you don't have anyone</i>
<i>to share those moments with,</i>

02:34.720 --> 02:37.480
<i>they can eventually</i>
<i>feel like they don't exist.</i>

02:41.080 --> 02:46.720
I can that tell you two have
a great foundation to build on. Honestly.

02:50.840 --> 02:54.760
It's not up to me
to tell you what's gonna happen.

02:54.840 --> 02:58.160
But, uh, as long as you have each other…

02:58.880 --> 03:00.440
things usually work out.

03:00.520 --> 03:03.320
LET GO

03:05.480 --> 03:07.720
Mummy, Mummy, Mummy, I'm hungry!

03:07.800 --> 03:10.840
- Ready in a minute, honey.
But I'm hungry now!

03:10.920 --> 03:12.240
I'm hungry!

03:12.320 --> 03:13.880
It really doesn't matter, Anna.

03:13.960 --> 03:15.840
- You don't fake my signature.
- Hi!

03:15.920 --> 03:17.800
Okay, and you don't go
rooting through my stuff.

03:17.880 --> 03:20.560
I didn't go through your bag.
I picked it up from the floor.

03:20.640 --> 03:22.320
You hung it up and went through it.

03:22.400 --> 03:26.320
But-- Anyway, you don't do that, Anna.
You don't sign my name.

03:26.400 --> 03:28.960
If it says for a parent to sign,
then I do it for you.

03:29.040 --> 03:30.000
- Hi.
- Okay!

03:30.080 --> 03:33.240
- All right? You're breaking the law here.
- Breaking the law? You're having a laugh!

03:33.320 --> 03:34.320
Can you lay the table?

03:34.400 --> 03:38.040
Hang on! Do you have any idea
how much I fucking practise every day?

03:38.120 --> 03:39.800
- I do have a fucking idea.
- Hi.

03:39.880 --> 03:41.440
- Shut up.
- I have noticed.

03:41.520 --> 03:44.160
What's the point
in practising so much if I can't compete?

03:44.240 --> 03:46.680
- I didn't say you can't compete.
- What's the problem then?

03:46.760 --> 03:49.760
The problem is you were going
without telling me. That's the problem.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.600
- I am in charge of my own life!
- Yeah. Right.

03:52.680 --> 03:55.600
- I want the same pasta for me.
- It is the same pasta.

03:55.680 --> 03:57.240
- Exactly the same.
- Hello?

03:57.320 --> 03:59.720
Hello?
Have you stopped talking to me, then?

03:59.800 --> 04:02.160
Ugh. Manne, you'll get a tummy ache
from the other pasta.

04:02.240 --> 04:04.760
- This is the right one.
- I'm the only one that got picked!

04:04.840 --> 04:06.240
Do I just give that up?

04:06.320 --> 04:07.720
Lulu says I've got what it takes!

04:07.800 --> 04:11.240
- Well, Lulu is not your mother, okay?
- Yeah, whatever! But I wish she was.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.200
Oh, but if Lulu had been your mother,

04:15.280 --> 04:18.040
I think she would want to have
an idea of her daughter's whereabouts.

04:18.120 --> 04:20.840
- That's what I'm saying.
- Why does it always have to be your way?

04:20.920 --> 04:23.680
Why do you always
have to decide everything all the time?

04:23.760 --> 04:25.480
I don't. Give me a break.

04:25.560 --> 04:29.720
Can everyone please leave their shoes,
coats, and bags where they're meant to?

04:29.800 --> 04:32.360
I don't care what you say.
I'm going anyway.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.560
Oh, God.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.080
And, actually,
do you think I want you two there?

04:36.160 --> 04:39.640
You argue all the fucking time
or you just don't speak.

04:39.720 --> 04:42.480
And so what do you
bring to the party, anyway?

04:42.560 --> 04:45.360
- You know what? I've had enough, okay?
- Just look at yourself.

04:46.800 --> 04:50.960
Dad and I will talk about it.
Here you go, Manne, have some cucumber.

04:51.040 --> 04:54.120
Why can't you talk about it now?
You're both here.

04:54.200 --> 04:58.000
What's the problem? I don't get it.
Just talk to me.

04:58.080 --> 05:01.080
- I don't have time for this now.
- The time for what?

05:01.160 --> 05:03.840
So, is the problem
the dancing's too raunchy?

05:04.760 --> 05:08.040
'Cause you know what? That says something
about you, you fucking paedo!

05:08.120 --> 05:10.000
- Oh, for fuck's sake.
- What's a paedo?

05:10.080 --> 05:10.920
Mum!

05:11.000 --> 05:13.840
Anna, I said your father and I
will discuss it, but first--

05:13.920 --> 05:15.760
You know what? Fuck off!

05:16.880 --> 05:18.440
This pasta is blech!

05:18.960 --> 05:20.960
Fuck off!

05:42.400 --> 05:44.920
- I need to tell you something--
- I want to separate.

05:49.560 --> 05:50.960
I would like a divorce.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.560
It's not working.

06:01.240 --> 06:02.400
- Mummy!
- No.

06:02.480 --> 06:04.000
- I, uh…
- Yes.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.600
I can't do this.

06:21.720 --> 06:23.600
It's not working!

06:23.680 --> 06:25.320
We can't get a divorce.

06:27.200 --> 06:28.040
Not right now.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.160
What's not working?

06:39.160 --> 06:41.520
- Show me.
- This. Look, it's not working.

06:41.600 --> 06:43.480
What if you press here?

06:45.600 --> 06:47.680
Okay, you see now? It's working.

07:34.960 --> 07:36.240
Oh, God.

07:40.480 --> 07:41.600
Mummy?

07:42.800 --> 07:46.760
"Even though Supermanne
was only a few months old,

07:46.840 --> 07:49.760
he'd seen more than any other superbaby."

07:54.000 --> 07:57.080
"Finally, the Superfamily was complete."

07:58.000 --> 08:01.800
"And now nothing could ever stop them."

08:19.640 --> 08:22.160
I've already decided. We're going.

08:22.240 --> 08:24.520
Look, I know you want to punish me.
It's understandable.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.680
I want to punish you, do I,
with your family?

08:26.760 --> 08:27.840
Supporting your daughter?

08:27.920 --> 08:31.160
No, but just now
you said you didn't want to go.

08:31.240 --> 08:34.440
Well, now I do.
"Till death do us part," we said.

08:34.520 --> 08:36.920
Now you want a divorce.
You can change your mind.

08:39.680 --> 08:43.880
So you want to go now
just 'cause I want a divorce?

08:43.960 --> 08:45.800
No, I want you
to be present in their lives

08:45.880 --> 08:47.520
and be their parent before that.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.920
- But I am present and I am their father--
- Oh, wonderful!

08:50.000 --> 08:51.840
Then we're leaving in two weeks.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.920
Just tell me, are we okay?

09:06.480 --> 09:09.600
Do you really think
we have a good relationship?

09:11.360 --> 09:14.480
I think we just need
to calm down a moment.

09:14.560 --> 09:18.520
Then you'll realise
that it's the right thing, all right?

09:19.280 --> 09:20.280
We have to.

09:20.360 --> 09:22.920
No. No.

09:27.760 --> 09:29.560
No, no, come on. No…

09:30.280 --> 09:32.920
Let's sit down here.
I think, er, we should talk--

09:33.000 --> 09:35.640
No, there's nothing to talk about.
You're coming.

09:36.320 --> 09:39.200
This competition might not mean
anything to you, but it does to her.

09:39.280 --> 09:42.280
So we're going.
That's it. End of discussion.

09:42.360 --> 09:43.560
No, but…

09:45.280 --> 09:48.080
Um, I think you should just go without me.

09:48.160 --> 09:50.960
You misunderstand me. You are coming.

09:52.040 --> 09:55.280
And we can talk about divorce
afterwards when we get home with the kids,

09:55.360 --> 09:56.480
but just know

09:57.000 --> 10:01.480
that we'll just have to pretend
that things are brilliant as always.

10:02.240 --> 10:03.080
Hmm?

10:03.160 --> 10:04.760
No, no, just listen.

10:04.840 --> 10:07.640
- I can't just go and pretend--
- You know what?

10:07.720 --> 10:13.240
When we are a family again,
a real family, you can leave me then.

10:14.320 --> 10:17.800
But we're a family until that moment.
Family united.

10:17.880 --> 10:18.880
All right?

10:24.840 --> 10:29.640
This is her way
of always controlling all of the world.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.920
And she's obviously out of control,
that's the problem.

10:32.000 --> 10:33.920
It's…
It's like she's scheming or something.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.400
What's she playing at?

10:35.480 --> 10:39.920
We should have a sort of healing process,
then get divorced?

10:40.000 --> 10:43.680
I'm sorry,
but is it reasonable to expect me

10:43.760 --> 10:48.360
to behave like "Mr. Happy Families,"
who loves her, is attracted to her,

10:48.440 --> 10:53.040
till one day she can find a way
to actually go on living without me?

10:53.120 --> 10:54.440
I'm sorry, but I… I can't.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.240
I… I can't deal with that!

10:56.880 --> 10:58.200
Gustav, come.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.200
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Sit down. Come here.

11:00.280 --> 11:01.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

11:02.040 --> 11:03.120
Come on.

11:04.200 --> 11:06.400
Damn. Mmm.

11:06.480 --> 11:08.520
- Take a breath.
- Ah, right.

11:09.800 --> 11:12.360
- Mmm.
- It's okay.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.800
Look, she's just
concerned about the children.

11:14.880 --> 11:16.080
No, no, no. She…

11:16.160 --> 11:19.200
Listen, they have no more problems
than anyone else in the world.

11:19.280 --> 11:20.520
Really?

11:21.560 --> 11:23.200
- You don't know them.
- No.

11:23.280 --> 11:24.720
No, I don't.

11:25.760 --> 11:26.760
Do you?

11:27.800 --> 11:30.320
- What?
- Look, I don't mean it like that.

11:31.720 --> 11:33.720
I can just feel that you are…

11:34.480 --> 11:38.600
Well, I think it could be possible
that maybe you haven't been present,

11:39.120 --> 11:40.560
and they need you right now.

11:41.080 --> 11:44.280
But that's really
not what's at stake, I mean…

11:44.360 --> 11:46.040
It seems like it is.

11:47.280 --> 11:48.960
Ugh.

11:49.040 --> 11:52.320
- Gustav, I'm just trying to help, huh?
- I know. I know.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.280
You're just so good to me, darling.

11:55.360 --> 11:56.240
Mmm.

12:00.040 --> 12:04.280
And the worst thing is, and I admit
I've been hating myself for it…

12:04.360 --> 12:07.800
- Hmm?
- …but I seem really pathetic about it all.

12:07.880 --> 12:12.040
Pathetic? Perhaps you are.
You are pathetic, but you're also lovely.

12:12.120 --> 12:14.800
- Mmm, yeah. Right.
- So sweet.

12:14.880 --> 12:16.840
- Sweet and… Sweet and tasty.
- Hmm? Yeah?

12:16.920 --> 12:18.040
For fuck's sake.

12:18.120 --> 12:21.040
It's ridiculous, all of this.

12:21.120 --> 12:23.840
It's just so unnecessary and needless.

12:23.920 --> 12:28.040
it doesn't need to be
such a traumatic process.

12:28.720 --> 12:31.560
- But, hey. Hey.
- Mmm?

12:33.600 --> 12:35.000
I think you're overreacting.

12:35.080 --> 12:36.080
Mmm.

12:36.160 --> 12:39.800
It's only a couple of weeks, okay?

12:40.520 --> 12:42.960
She's wanting a nice end to it all.

12:44.200 --> 12:46.560
- And you can give them that.
- Yeah.

12:47.480 --> 12:50.400
Then it will be me and you forever, babe.

12:51.280 --> 12:52.760
- Okay?
- Mmm. Mmm.

13:06.760 --> 13:09.000
- You want a hand with that?
- No, I'm fine.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.280
You know
you can't pack a screwdriver?

13:11.360 --> 13:13.160
- No, I know.
- And what about these?

13:13.680 --> 13:16.240
There. Okay.

13:16.320 --> 13:18.400
Okay. There.

13:18.480 --> 13:20.200
- Where are my hot pants?
- Er…

13:20.280 --> 13:21.560
Oh, I'll go and get them.

13:23.400 --> 13:26.320
Hey! That's staying here, Manne.

13:28.320 --> 13:29.440
Okay…

13:38.160 --> 13:39.160
I'm going to miss you.

13:39.240 --> 13:40.840
Me too. Safe flight

13:40.920 --> 13:43.040
Don't run!
Hey, you need to put that in.

13:43.120 --> 13:44.880
- Yeah, I know.
- Manne!

13:44.960 --> 13:47.760
- Oh, and that has to go right there.
- Yes, I know! Leave me alone!

13:47.840 --> 13:49.200
Hey, honey, come here.

13:49.280 --> 13:52.080
Whoa. Come on, honey, let's go.
We have to.

13:52.160 --> 13:54.520
- There are a lot of people waiting.
- No!

13:54.600 --> 13:57.080
We'll be late for our flight. Come on.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.200
Get that.

13:59.280 --> 14:02.080
- I don't want to go to Skåne!
- No, but I do, honey.

14:03.520 --> 14:06.240
Oh, what the fuck?

14:09.280 --> 14:12.240
- Anything in your pockets?
- Uh…

14:13.120 --> 14:15.040
Hang on, I need one of those.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.240
Come this way.

14:19.680 --> 14:23.200
Hey, Gustav, will you please go over there
and grab Anna's bag off the belt?

14:23.720 --> 14:25.720
Yes, that one. Thank you.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.440
- Hey, keep an eye on it.
- All over it.

14:29.520 --> 14:32.000
- Can I have a look at your bag?
- Come on, honey.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.480
- No!
- Yes. I say yes.

14:34.560 --> 14:35.520
Okay.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.800
Is it his?

14:38.480 --> 14:41.080
Yeah, it's my
five-year-old son's rucksack.

14:41.160 --> 14:43.800
What's in there?
What contraband have you found?

14:44.400 --> 14:45.360
That's my gun!

14:46.680 --> 14:49.520
It's a water gun.
Come on, it squirts water.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.000
- It's a toy.
- And what about this toy?

14:53.480 --> 14:56.520
Uh, well,
I don't know who would put that in there.

14:56.600 --> 14:58.880
- That's my dad's property.
- And what is this?

14:58.960 --> 15:01.800
- Kids, eh?
- This is staying here.

15:01.880 --> 15:05.000
Mum?
Can you tell him this is a dancing pole?

15:07.880 --> 15:10.440
No, no, no, don't do that.
Settle down.

15:10.520 --> 15:12.960
Please, darling, can you just sit down?

15:13.040 --> 15:17.440
Hey, uh, would you get me these
and, uh, a glass of red wine?

15:17.520 --> 15:19.800
- Oh!
- Do you want anything?

15:21.560 --> 15:22.400
No.

15:23.000 --> 15:25.680
No, please. Hey, stop it.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.600
Leave them alone, okay?

15:28.760 --> 15:31.840
Come down now. Okay, sit down.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.360
Phew!

15:33.440 --> 15:36.000
There's some food for you.

15:36.760 --> 15:39.280
- I said I don't want any.
- No, but…

15:41.920 --> 15:45.000
- It might be all right.
- Manne, Manne, Manne.

15:45.080 --> 15:46.360
Manne, please, sit down.

15:46.440 --> 15:48.800
Sit down. No, don't press the button.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.480

- Manne. No, come on.

15:58.000 --> 15:59.240
Bang, I shot you!

16:04.200 --> 16:08.040

16:47.720 --> 16:49.160
This is ours as well.

16:50.360 --> 16:51.720
Hello! Hello!

16:51.800 --> 16:54.560
- Hey! Look, it's Grandma.
- Hey!

16:56.360 --> 16:59.720
Oh! I'm so glad you rang!

16:59.800 --> 17:02.840
Hi, Astrid! All right?
It's brilliant to see you.

17:02.920 --> 17:06.440
- Yes! Oh, my darling!
- Yeah, um…

17:06.520 --> 17:07.640
Aww!

17:08.160 --> 17:10.840
It's so wonderful that you're here.

17:11.400 --> 17:15.960
- So, who've we got behind this mask, huh?
- He doesn't like to take off the mask.

17:16.040 --> 17:18.960
- So why don't you just…
- No. No, no, that I can understand.

17:19.040 --> 17:20.640
Super cool!

17:21.160 --> 17:23.920
We should all have
a really wonderful time at Grandma's!

17:24.000 --> 17:25.320
And get all comfy!

17:25.400 --> 17:27.400
We've got venison stew!

17:27.480 --> 17:29.200
- I'm vegetarian.
- What the fuck?

17:29.280 --> 17:30.480
It's just small bits.

17:31.000 --> 17:33.280
She's your mum
and we can't come all the way here

17:33.360 --> 17:34.800
and then not stay with her, can we?

17:34.880 --> 17:36.840
You shouldn't have told her
we were coming.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.240
Whatever you say, Gustav.

17:39.320 --> 17:40.880
But that's the way it is.

17:41.400 --> 17:44.600
Come on!
I was looking forward to seeing you!

17:49.680 --> 17:52.040
- Come on.
- Is he alive?

17:52.120 --> 17:54.480
He's alive. Yeah, come on.

17:56.240 --> 17:57.200
Right, then.

17:58.240 --> 18:01.040
I've made up the beds
in the guesthouse for you.

18:01.520 --> 18:04.920
It's usually a bit cold out there,
so you might want to light a fire

18:05.000 --> 18:06.640
an hour before bed.

18:06.720 --> 18:09.000
It can take a while
for the cabin to warm up.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.040
Yeah. I'll fix it.

18:12.600 --> 18:15.480
- I'll believe it when I see it.
- Don't worry, you'll soon see it.

18:15.560 --> 18:16.760
Okay.

18:16.840 --> 18:20.160
- I'll fix it, before we get--
- I already said I'll do it.

18:20.720 --> 18:24.160
Why didn't you mention
Anna was taking part in a competition?

18:24.240 --> 18:26.080
I would have loved to see her strip.

18:26.160 --> 18:29.480
- Hang on, it's not stripping.
- Oh, I'm not judging you, darling.

18:29.560 --> 18:33.120
But it's a bit judgey calling it
stripping, that's all she's saying.

18:33.200 --> 18:36.280
- Here, there you go.
- Thanks, but Manne doesn't eat gluten.

18:36.360 --> 18:39.760
Oh, God.
Everyone's so picky these days. I mean…

18:39.840 --> 18:42.840
Manne has just been
diagnosed with coeliac disease, so…

18:42.920 --> 18:45.160
It just means
he shouldn't have so much bread.

18:45.240 --> 18:47.320
It means that he can't have
any bread at all,

18:47.400 --> 18:49.080
because he is completely intolerant.

18:49.160 --> 18:50.440
Yeah, that's right.

18:50.520 --> 18:52.920
Call it what you like,
but I think it's stupid.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.720
Mum, can you please just drop it?

18:54.800 --> 18:57.960
But can't I say
what I want in my own house?

18:58.040 --> 19:00.960
In the old days,
when you were little…

19:01.040 --> 19:04.160
…a slice of bread wouldn't kill anyone.

19:05.440 --> 19:06.800
No, it's okay.

19:06.880 --> 19:07.880
- Here, have some.
- No.

19:07.960 --> 19:10.280
He gets a bad stomach ache
and diarrhoea, so it--

19:10.360 --> 19:12.840
Darling, how could he eat his food
without a loaf of bread?

19:12.920 --> 19:16.440
Please don't worry. I always bring
a bag of food with me, so it's all right.

19:16.520 --> 19:19.000
Or we do. And we always pack extra.

19:19.080 --> 19:22.200
If you ask me,
children these days are just plain spoilt.

19:22.280 --> 19:24.080
- No one asked you.
- No.

19:24.160 --> 19:26.800
You know what? It's not right, Gustav.

19:26.880 --> 19:30.680
You only have one mother,
and you need to work on that relationship.

19:30.760 --> 19:32.600
- What?
- Interesting.

19:32.680 --> 19:34.440
- Have you done that?
- Eh?

19:34.520 --> 19:36.960
Have you worked, Mum, on our relationship?

19:37.040 --> 19:38.520
- Oof.
- Okay.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.200
No, I want to know! Yeah.

19:40.280 --> 19:43.640
From your perspective,
have you done any work on this?

19:43.720 --> 19:44.920
Do you actually care?

19:45.000 --> 19:48.280
Dad, don't you need to heat up
the cabin? It'll be fucking freezing.

19:50.400 --> 19:53.840
- Go ahead, come on.
- But you… you never ping me.

19:53.920 --> 19:57.120
Try and be the best grandmother
you can be, but do it for your own sake.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.400
- I don't!
- Hello? Dad?

19:59.480 --> 20:02.480
You have no right to give me
grief for not calling and begging.

20:02.560 --> 20:04.000
Oh, my God!

20:04.080 --> 20:07.360
That doesn't mean that I don't
want you to be a part of our lives.

20:07.440 --> 20:10.880
- I know that, darling, but--
- I'm not gonna call you and beg for it.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.200
- I don't expect you to.
- Dad!

20:13.280 --> 20:15.360
If you'll excuse me,
I have a job to do.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.200
I'm gonna go chop some wood.

20:17.720 --> 20:20.240
Try to make sure
my family doesn't freeze to death.

20:27.120 --> 20:28.200
Holy shit.

20:38.360 --> 20:39.600
For fuck's sake!

20:40.600 --> 20:41.600
Shit.

21:10.000 --> 21:11.520
Here. Take this.

21:15.600 --> 21:17.000
Everything's all right.

21:42.240 --> 21:43.840
It's so fucking cold.

21:44.360 --> 21:46.120
It'll warm up soon, love.

21:50.640 --> 21:52.720
Okay. Tomorrow, we'll get a hotel.

22:13.840 --> 22:15.640
<i>I know you're in there.</i>

22:15.720 --> 22:17.760
Blink if you can hear me.

22:19.960 --> 22:21.640
Okay, thanks. Bye.

22:21.720 --> 22:23.240
Well…

22:28.480 --> 22:30.760
- He's hard work, I know.
- Yeah.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.400
At least he has you.

22:32.480 --> 22:33.480
Yes.

22:34.640 --> 22:38.280
Are you both doing okay? Hmm?

22:38.360 --> 22:40.120
- Mmm.
- Well, that's good.

22:41.000 --> 22:43.320
Because he needs you.

22:44.240 --> 22:46.560
- He needs both of us.
- Well.

22:46.640 --> 22:48.640
More than he could ever know.

22:51.800 --> 22:53.240
Take care.

22:55.240 --> 22:56.440
Okay.

22:56.520 --> 22:59.800
No, honey, you can't press the buttons.
We're going now.

23:00.400 --> 23:03.680
Mummy, I think he has superpowers.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.160
He does. We have to go. Come on.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.440
Can't we stay here?

23:07.520 --> 23:10.800
Oh, another time, sweetpea.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.680
Granny has so much to do. Boring stuff.

23:15.200 --> 23:16.880
I want to stay here!

23:16.960 --> 23:19.240
Yes, I know, honey.
But you know what?

23:19.320 --> 23:21.880
The hotel is really close
to where Anna's competing,

23:21.960 --> 23:23.320
so it'll be a lot easier.

23:23.400 --> 23:24.480
Come on. here we go.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.160
Let's put your seat belt on.

23:55.800 --> 23:59.880
My understanding was that we'd be
staying much closer to the actual venue.

23:59.960 --> 24:04.280
But you're
so very near to everything from here.

24:04.360 --> 24:05.520
I really mean it.

24:05.600 --> 24:09.920
And it's so great that we have
older contestants signed up this year.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.440
- It would be great to be competing, but--
- Right. Room key.

24:12.520 --> 24:15.560
And how far away did you say it was?

24:15.640 --> 24:17.760
- It's just a stone's throw away.
- Mmm.

24:17.840 --> 24:19.920
Um, if you've got a good arm.

24:21.360 --> 24:24.560
- I need to fill up the car.
- Daddy, I want this!

24:24.640 --> 24:27.920
- Don't mess about with that, please.
- But I can't leave him behind.

24:28.000 --> 24:29.840
- He's my friend.
- Can you leave it?

24:29.920 --> 24:31.840
- Put him back where you found him.
- No.

24:31.920 --> 24:35.040
- Please stop arguing, will you? Okay.
- Pump's open, so you can fill up.

24:35.120 --> 24:37.320
Thanks a lot. Let's see.

24:37.400 --> 24:38.840
Hmm. Okay.

24:39.680 --> 24:41.320
- Daddy!
- Hello, what are you doing?

24:41.400 --> 24:43.680
- Are we staying here or--
- Yep, yep! I'll be right back.

24:43.760 --> 24:45.000
So they've got magazines here.

24:45.080 --> 24:47.000
You can have one each,
and I'll come right back.

24:47.080 --> 24:49.320
- I don't want a magazine. I want Gorgor.
- Okay!

24:49.400 --> 24:52.640
You can have that, all right?
Look, I'm coming back in a second.

24:52.720 --> 24:55.120
You wait here. Keep an eye on him.

25:12.080 --> 25:13.400
My mum made those.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.280
Postcards.

25:17.040 --> 25:20.280
She was bored and started to, uh,
scribble on paper.

25:21.200 --> 25:23.960
My dad saw the potential
and printed the cards.

25:24.480 --> 25:26.040
He thought they were beautiful.

25:26.720 --> 25:27.880
Yeah, whatever.

25:27.960 --> 25:30.240
Anna, look, it's Mummy on this magazine.

25:30.320 --> 25:32.680
No, it isn't. Just leave it alone.

25:32.760 --> 25:33.960
Stop it.

25:35.040 --> 25:37.440
Oh, I don't…
There's something wrong with him.

25:37.520 --> 25:39.240
Yeah.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.000
Hot mum, though.

25:46.400 --> 25:49.680
<i>He was tougher</i>
<i>than I expected, but I stood my ground.</i>

25:49.760 --> 25:52.120
- Okay.
- <i>Just like you said.</i>

25:52.200 --> 25:54.120
<i>So I got what I wanted in the end.</i>

25:54.960 --> 25:55.960
Oh, well.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.760
<i>- I miss you.</i>
- I miss you too.

26:00.440 --> 26:02.400
<i>- Talk later. Big kiss.</i>
- Big kiss.

26:05.600 --> 26:07.600
RECENTS

26:18.400 --> 26:20.000
It's only about ten minutes from here.

26:20.080 --> 26:21.080
Okay.

26:21.880 --> 26:23.800
Could've been worse, I guess.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.360
Uh, yep. Yeah, I'll settle up here, and…

26:26.440 --> 26:27.480
Mmm-hmm.

26:28.960 --> 26:30.360
The woman, who is she?

26:41.320 --> 26:42.360
A colleague.

26:48.320 --> 26:50.600
I'm not having her on this trip.
Okay, Gustav?

26:53.680 --> 26:54.760
No.

26:54.840 --> 26:55.920
Mmm.

27:21.480 --> 27:22.360
Here.

27:29.400 --> 27:30.560
Manne!

27:31.400 --> 27:32.440
Manne!

27:32.520 --> 27:34.840
- Where's Manne?
- Sweetie?

27:35.760 --> 27:38.000
I only left him with her
for one minute.

27:38.080 --> 27:39.000
One minute!

27:39.080 --> 27:41.440
Listen to me. I should be able
to leave them for a minute.

27:41.520 --> 27:43.600
- Absolutely. Let's get going.
- Yeah.

27:44.560 --> 27:45.840
Just stop.

27:47.720 --> 27:49.080
You're driving me insane.

27:49.920 --> 27:54.240
Look, you're obviously pissed off with me,
which is fair enough. I get it.

27:54.320 --> 27:56.760
But tell me,
why can't you just behave like you are?

27:56.840 --> 27:58.640
You're saying I should be yelling, Gustav?

27:58.720 --> 28:02.080
I think you should
express your emotions in a normal fashion.

28:02.160 --> 28:05.240
What you're doing to me
really is not normal.

28:05.320 --> 28:07.160
It's not normal. It scares me.

28:07.240 --> 28:12.120
I'm seeing someone behind your back,
and all I get from you is…

28:12.640 --> 28:13.840
You're ice cold!

28:13.920 --> 28:16.680
Yeah, just like that, stone-face!
Fucking stone-face!

28:16.760 --> 28:19.240
What do you feel? What do you feel?

28:19.320 --> 28:21.560
- Want to know what I feel?
- Yeah, I do. I do.

28:21.640 --> 28:22.760
- I have to.
- Okay.

28:22.840 --> 28:24.160
- Absolutely.
- Hmm.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.800
I am so done with this.

28:29.680 --> 28:32.160
I'm so tired of doing all of this.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.160
You never help with anything. Nothing.

28:35.240 --> 28:38.760
I mean, I booked this,
packed everything, every single bag.

28:38.840 --> 28:40.120
You have done nothing.

28:40.200 --> 28:41.280
Come on.

28:41.360 --> 28:45.200
Obviously you've decided to resign
as my husband, and father.

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
Okay, so you're telling me
you're living with a man from the '50s?

28:49.080 --> 28:51.360
- Yes, that's right!
- Yeah, I get it. I get it.

28:51.440 --> 28:56.160
Excuse me, but I am certainly
utterly capable. I am very capable.

28:56.240 --> 28:57.600
How can you say that?

28:57.680 --> 29:00.560
You were meant to keep an eye on them,
just for a minute, weren't you?

29:00.640 --> 29:03.840
I was filling up the tank, all right?
For our bloody trip to a strip show.

29:03.920 --> 29:07.800
And I found our five-year-old boy
sat in a ditch looking at porn.

29:08.800 --> 29:12.480
It's more important to ring your mistress
than watch your kids for a few minutes?

29:12.560 --> 29:15.600
You know what?
That fucking scares me, Gustav!

29:16.240 --> 29:19.240
If you're left alone with them,
how on earth could you take care of them?

29:19.320 --> 29:22.000
Oh, fuck's sake.
Listen, we're talking about a minute here.

29:22.080 --> 29:25.000
Exposure to porn for a minute!
That's all! One minute!

29:25.080 --> 29:27.680
It isn't just about the porn.
It's much more.

29:27.760 --> 29:29.600
You were always separate.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.800
That's your problem,
you're never fucking here.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.800
I'm stood-- I'm stood here.
I'm here right now.

29:33.880 --> 29:35.840
I'm standing right here.
You just don't see me.

29:35.920 --> 29:37.640
- I'm fucking invisible!
- Oh, right.

29:37.720 --> 29:40.760
Yeah, sure thing, I'm six feet tall,
but you keep talking over me all the time!

29:40.840 --> 29:42.960
Over my head!
My kids don't even answer me.

29:43.040 --> 29:45.360
Gustav, have you considered
that there's a reason for that?

29:45.440 --> 29:46.880
- And you know, I suppose?
- I do, yeah.

29:46.960 --> 29:49.760
You're distracted.
Your mind is completely elsewhere!

29:49.840 --> 29:52.040
You haven't a clue
what's going on with them,

29:52.120 --> 29:53.840
'cause you're always apart.

29:53.920 --> 29:57.200
They see!
They see that you don't see them.

29:57.280 --> 29:59.680
That you always…
That you don't listen to me.

30:01.640 --> 30:04.440
- You don't listen properly!
- No, I listen, and I'm not--

30:04.520 --> 30:05.800
- You--
- Huh?

30:06.320 --> 30:08.520
- What, Gustav? You don't listen to anyone!
- I listen!

30:08.600 --> 30:11.120
Just hear me!
I'm a fucking professional listener!

30:11.200 --> 30:13.080
I listen to people
night and day for God's sake!

30:13.160 --> 30:15.400
- Can't I have any free time?
- You know what?

30:15.480 --> 30:17.360
- You want to divorce me?
- Yes, I want that.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.680
And that's just fine,
but you can't divorce your children.

30:21.640 --> 30:24.800
And it's for their sake we're here now,
so can you please just--

30:24.880 --> 30:28.680
We are here to watch our sixteen-year-old
baby daughter in a strip show.

30:28.760 --> 30:30.960
- Stripping.
- It's dance on a pole.

30:31.040 --> 30:34.000
Yeah, but she doesn't fucking
want us here. But we are here.

30:34.080 --> 30:36.560
You know why? Because I listened to you.

30:36.640 --> 30:39.160
Here we are.
And it's a fucking catastrophe.

30:39.240 --> 30:41.360
- Hmm.
- Start of the end of it all.

30:41.440 --> 30:44.520
- You can't ask any more of me.
- Yes, I can.

30:44.600 --> 30:47.560
To be here, all right? All of you.

30:47.640 --> 30:49.760
Not just in body, all of you.

30:50.720 --> 30:52.040
To please…

30:53.200 --> 30:57.480
prioritise your family just
for a few days. It's not a lot to ask.

30:58.520 --> 31:01.120
- It's so cruel that… It's not right.
- No, you know what? No.

31:01.200 --> 31:04.240
You asked me to say how I feel.
Do you know how I feel?

31:04.760 --> 31:06.360
I feel as if I am your mother.

31:06.440 --> 31:08.240
Okay.

31:08.320 --> 31:10.360
You need to work on your relationships,
Gustav,

31:10.440 --> 31:12.560
or you're going to end up
so fucking alone!

31:12.640 --> 31:15.640
Yeah. Help me with my relationships.

31:15.720 --> 31:16.920
So bizarre.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.280
- Can you turn the phone off when we're--
- No, I can't.

31:19.360 --> 31:21.600
Give me the phone and I'll help you.
How hard can it be?

31:21.680 --> 31:24.360
- Can you give-- What's your problem?
- You're not having my phone.

31:24.880 --> 31:26.400
Mummy's angry.

31:27.080 --> 31:28.080
Mmm.

31:28.160 --> 31:30.120
Stop!

31:30.200 --> 31:31.920
- Enough!
- Give me my phone.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.360
- Give me my phone!
- Want it? There you are.

31:37.520 --> 31:40.120
- What the fuck?
- There you go.

31:40.200 --> 31:43.560
- They're both mad.
- Mmm.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.160
You're fucking sick.

31:47.600 --> 31:48.960
You're sick, you know.

31:53.680 --> 31:57.280
And you know what you are?
You are such a selfish arsehole.

31:58.040 --> 31:59.200
Listen to me.

31:59.280 --> 32:03.000
You're still going to have your children
even when I'm not in your life.

32:03.840 --> 32:06.760
And I won't be there
to clear up all of your mistakes.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.400
If you can make your kids happy,

32:09.480 --> 32:13.000
even by going to fucking Skåne
to see them strip, you do it!

32:13.080 --> 32:14.080
Okay?

32:14.680 --> 32:16.680
With a smile! Hmm?

32:33.560 --> 32:35.120
All right. I can do that.

32:36.160 --> 32:37.160
I'll listen.

32:40.520 --> 32:41.680
Good idea!

32:43.240 --> 32:44.960
I feel happier already.

32:46.000 --> 32:47.200
Yeah.

32:47.280 --> 32:50.200
Hey! Shall we find a fancy hotel, eh?

32:54.880 --> 32:55.880
Ah!

32:57.880 --> 33:00.240
Okay, put your seat belts on, everybody.

33:01.960 --> 33:03.200
There we are.

33:05.640 --> 33:06.680
Let's go!

33:06.760 --> 33:08.560
Ah…

33:11.200 --> 33:14.800
<i>- ♪ Oh, 'cause I'm happy ♪</i>

33:14.880 --> 33:18.480
<i>♪ I'm happy ♪</i>

33:18.560 --> 33:20.480
YOU'RE NOT BORN OUT OF HELL
YOU CREATE IT YOURSELF

33:20.560 --> 33:22.280
<i>♪ Happy! ♪</i>

33:24.080 --> 33:26.520

33:26.600 --> 33:28.160
Oh shit, that's me!

33:28.240 --> 33:30.280
I can relate to that, Stella!

33:32.280 --> 33:34.680
Can you feel the joy
flowing through us?

33:34.760 --> 33:37.840
Oh, it's classic. I'm just enjoying it.

33:37.920 --> 33:40.120
<i>- ♪ Happy ♪</i>

33:40.200 --> 33:43.560

33:47.520 --> 33:51.200

33:55.480 --> 33:58.520
Yup!
No, no, no, don't you carry them.

33:58.600 --> 34:02.040
I'll carry them. I'll carry them.
I want to enjoy the feeling of… of…

34:02.120 --> 34:04.480
really putting… putting some work in.

34:05.080 --> 34:06.080
Come on.

34:06.600 --> 34:08.720
This is gonna be great.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.600
And look where we're staying.

34:11.680 --> 34:14.360
Oh, yeah, this is gonna be great. Perfect.

34:14.880 --> 34:17.520
And this stuff
weighs virtually nothing really.

34:24.280 --> 34:26.400
- This is my bed!
- Yeah?

34:26.480 --> 34:30.720
Okay, that's everything!
We're here, and it's cozy, and it's warm.

34:30.800 --> 34:33.720
- I know that's important to you.
- Where's my round pole bag?

34:39.400 --> 34:41.920
What the fuck
were you thinking?

34:42.000 --> 34:43.480
What the fuck were you thinking?

34:43.560 --> 34:46.320
The whole point of coming here
is for my fucking competition!

34:46.400 --> 34:49.600
All my gear is in that fucking bag!
How the fuck could you forget it?

34:49.680 --> 34:51.120
My hot pants, everything!

34:51.200 --> 34:54.080
Every fucking thing!
The fuck were you thinking?

34:54.160 --> 34:57.160
You're fucking useless, both of you!
I hate-- Let go of me!

34:57.240 --> 34:58.800
Fuck you! Fuck off!

35:00.120 --> 35:02.920
- Mummy…
- Yeah, don't worry.

35:05.440 --> 35:07.360
She just got a bit angry.

35:08.080 --> 35:09.880
That happens sometimes.

35:27.200 --> 35:29.480
Go to hell!

35:34.680 --> 35:36.800
Get out! Get the fuck out!

35:36.880 --> 35:39.680
Hey, I know this isn't good.
It's my fault.

35:40.280 --> 35:41.280
I'm sorry.

35:41.360 --> 35:42.480
And…

35:45.080 --> 35:48.320
Hey, whatever you're feeling right now,
it's all right--

35:48.400 --> 35:50.520
Stop playing the fucking therapist!

35:50.600 --> 35:53.240
You've ruined everything!
You always ruin everything!

35:54.560 --> 35:55.400
Yeah.

35:58.640 --> 36:00.440
How about we go for a drive?

36:00.520 --> 36:03.280
Maybe we can buy you
some other outfits somewhere?

36:03.360 --> 36:05.560
How the fuck
do you forget a bag at Arlanda?

36:05.640 --> 36:07.840
I told you to keep an eye on it!

36:09.000 --> 36:10.120
Yeah. You did.

36:31.760 --> 36:33.240
Hey. Hey.

36:39.920 --> 36:42.200
Uh, the shops are closing soon,

36:42.280 --> 36:45.040
but if we hurry up,
we should still be all right.

36:45.120 --> 36:47.440
Let's see if we can find you something.

36:47.520 --> 36:49.560
Over my dead body.

36:52.480 --> 36:54.200
You're so fucking useless, you know that?

36:55.240 --> 36:56.240
Yeah.

36:57.120 --> 36:58.160
I know.

36:59.160 --> 37:00.240
I've heard it said.

37:00.960 --> 37:02.480
"And Little One said,

37:03.080 --> 37:06.320
'I am angry, and grumpy,
and no one loves me.'"

37:07.720 --> 37:10.160
"'Oh, Little One,' Big One said."

37:10.240 --> 37:12.640
"'You are grumpy, yes, you are,

37:12.720 --> 37:16.160
but I love you, however you are.'"

37:30.120 --> 37:31.640
Are you sad, Mummy?

37:32.960 --> 37:34.960
No, honey, I'm not.

37:58.080 --> 37:59.120
Here.

37:59.200 --> 38:00.200
This one?

38:01.080 --> 38:02.400
Are you kidding?

38:07.640 --> 38:08.640
Here.

38:09.720 --> 38:10.880
What do you think?

38:12.800 --> 38:13.640
What?

38:16.320 --> 38:18.600
Please, look,
you can have anything you want in here.

38:18.680 --> 38:19.840
- Whatever you like.
- Okay.

38:19.920 --> 38:21.360
Why the hell would I want to dance

38:21.440 --> 38:23.720
in a pair of neon blue leggings
with knee pads on for?

38:23.800 --> 38:25.680
That's a good thing!

38:25.760 --> 38:27.920
They are well manufactured.

38:28.000 --> 38:30.280
And, uh, they have knee pads.

38:30.360 --> 38:32.800
They're elastic. They're sporty.

38:32.880 --> 38:35.640
What? You have to help me.
You have to help me.

38:35.720 --> 38:38.040
Help me, 'cause I have no… no idea.

38:38.120 --> 38:41.600
But, Dad, do you know what?
Everything I ever needed was in that bag.

38:42.120 --> 38:43.880
- All of it.
- Yeah.

38:43.960 --> 38:44.960
Yeah, I get it.

38:45.040 --> 38:47.480
And I am so terribly sorry
about all of this.

38:47.560 --> 38:51.480
I understand how you feel,
I understand that you're angry,

38:51.560 --> 38:54.680
and I am so, so,
so sorry for what happened.

38:54.760 --> 38:55.880
Really.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.760
But now we're here.
We have to make the best of it.

39:00.840 --> 39:04.680
Just have a think about what you need,
and show me what you want.

39:06.440 --> 39:07.760
You know, if you…

39:07.840 --> 39:11.320
if you'd ever been to watch me pole dance,
you would've known that.

39:11.960 --> 39:12.800
If you'd only…

39:12.880 --> 39:16.720
If you ever thought about anyone else,
you wouldn't have left my bag.

39:17.240 --> 39:19.560
But you don't, Dad. You don't do anything.

39:19.640 --> 39:20.640
Yes, I do, Anna.

39:20.720 --> 39:24.760
I'm standing here right now
and I'm doing all I can.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.440
It's too late now.

39:28.640 --> 39:30.640
For me, now,
the competition's already over.

39:30.720 --> 39:32.960
- What? No, no, no.
- Yes.

39:33.040 --> 39:35.440
Hey, hey, hey.

39:36.240 --> 39:37.240
Okay.

39:39.800 --> 39:41.560
I understand this isn't ideal.

39:41.640 --> 39:45.920
I know this isn't exactly the shop
where you can buy pole dancing outfits.

39:46.920 --> 39:48.160
But now we're here.

39:48.240 --> 39:51.160
And we're actually
both after the same thing.

39:51.920 --> 39:54.560
Which is for you to have fun
doing what you want

39:54.640 --> 39:57.400
whilst performing
in the pole dancing competition.

39:58.200 --> 40:02.200
So just be completely honest,
tell me what you need,

40:02.880 --> 40:04.480
and I will fix that for you.

40:07.200 --> 40:08.560
A pair of gold hot pants.

40:08.640 --> 40:09.920
A pair of what?

40:11.320 --> 40:14.400
You see?
It's no good. Fuck it, I'm off.

40:14.480 --> 40:16.560
Okay, okay! Wait, we'll, uh…

40:17.080 --> 40:18.680
Let's try and think about it this way.

40:18.760 --> 40:20.000
Now, uh…

40:20.520 --> 40:21.920
Let's just take our time. We…

40:22.000 --> 40:26.520
I'll pick out a few things
that hopefully you won't hate.

40:26.600 --> 40:27.600
You never know.

40:27.680 --> 40:30.160
You look too.
We could come across something.

40:30.240 --> 40:34.120
We'll bring it home,
and you can try it on in your own time.

40:34.640 --> 40:36.320
See how it works.

40:36.400 --> 40:39.560
Find something that you want to wear
for your competition, okay?

40:46.560 --> 40:47.440
Okay.

40:49.080 --> 40:52.000
I'll get these just in case
you want to try them. You never know.

40:54.200 --> 40:55.080
Yeah.

40:55.920 --> 40:56.920
Okay.

40:59.520 --> 41:01.720
Look, I know it's not perfect,

41:01.800 --> 41:03.880
but I think I can do something with them.

41:03.960 --> 41:06.320
Yep.

41:06.400 --> 41:08.840
I… I have an idea.

41:08.920 --> 41:09.920
Okay?

41:10.600 --> 41:12.640
Yeah. Do what you want.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.520
All right. That everything?

41:16.360 --> 41:17.720
And there we are.

41:19.480 --> 41:21.640
- How'd it go?
- Shit.

41:33.840 --> 41:35.880
She doesn't make it easy.

41:35.960 --> 41:39.280
She doesn't make it easy
for anyone, least of all herself.

41:40.240 --> 41:42.080
What do you want me to say?

41:43.440 --> 41:46.360
- That I don't know my daughter?
- Do you think that's what I'm after?

41:47.320 --> 41:48.320
I don't know.

41:50.560 --> 41:53.200
Why didn't you tell me
how important this is for her?

41:54.520 --> 41:56.480
Why didn't you ask her yourself?

41:59.000 --> 42:01.280
You have to step up to the plate, Gustav.

42:02.080 --> 42:03.560
Take responsibility.

42:04.480 --> 42:06.960
It is our responsibility as parents.

42:08.160 --> 42:11.440
It's not about buying expensive things
and spoiling them.

42:11.960 --> 42:13.920
It's about being there when it matters.

42:14.000 --> 42:16.200
- Okay.
- Or when it doesn't matter.

42:16.280 --> 42:19.400
- I'm very aware of how it all functions.
- Yeah.

42:19.480 --> 42:22.600
But it's not that easy
when you've taken that place, okay?

42:22.680 --> 42:24.720
Oh, please. Okay.

42:24.800 --> 42:28.160
Maybe it's not even your fault.
Maybe it's the system. Fine.

42:28.240 --> 42:30.560
I'm the one who drives and all that.
Pays the family bills.

42:30.640 --> 42:32.800
You're the one
that goes to the parent's meetings.

42:32.880 --> 42:35.680
It may be a male or female thing,
call it what you will.

42:35.760 --> 42:38.760
But these roles, we've followed them.

42:38.840 --> 42:41.000
And that means the role I have,

42:41.080 --> 42:43.760
I'm on the outside.
There's no place for me here.

42:43.840 --> 42:46.360
Okay, but if you'd wanted that place,

42:46.440 --> 42:49.000
you could've said something
or done something about it.

42:49.080 --> 42:50.800
I've tried very hard and you know it.

42:50.880 --> 42:53.000
I've done this
to make things easier for you.

42:53.080 --> 42:53.960
Okay, yeah.

42:54.040 --> 42:56.480
But if I go
and pack the bags for them all,

42:56.560 --> 42:59.760
you will want to go and repack them
like if I didn't do it properly.

42:59.840 --> 43:02.680
I pack the kid's bags
because I know where their things are.

43:02.760 --> 43:04.040
You can never find anything.

43:04.120 --> 43:06.440
No, 'cause you always
go and move everything.

43:06.520 --> 43:09.480
Things are never, ever where I leave them.
It's the same old problem.

43:09.560 --> 43:12.080
Is this really all about
who packs the kids bags?

43:12.160 --> 43:13.560
- No. No.
- No? No.

43:13.640 --> 43:18.280
This is about the children
and that I don't know them one bit

43:18.360 --> 43:23.160
'cause you have never allowed me
to take any responsibility.

43:23.800 --> 43:24.800
That's the real problem.

43:30.320 --> 43:33.080
You are a total control freak.

43:33.880 --> 43:35.160
You really are.

43:36.200 --> 43:40.880
You always think it'll go to hell
if you're not there making it possible.

43:41.600 --> 43:42.880
Yes, I worry about that.

43:42.960 --> 43:46.800
Yeah, you do, so you don't include me
in the lives of our family.

43:46.880 --> 43:50.000
- I've never excluded you.
- But you haven't included me either.

43:50.080 --> 43:52.440
Do you understand?
You're always expecting me to fail.

43:52.520 --> 43:56.000
Everything has to be done your way,
and I can't even breathe,

43:56.080 --> 43:57.760
the pressure is just unbearable.

44:00.440 --> 44:02.200
Maybe our aims are different.

44:04.640 --> 44:07.200
No, we don't have different aims.

44:07.280 --> 44:09.720
We have exactly the same ones.

44:11.200 --> 44:13.360
We have different ways of going about it.

44:18.480 --> 44:22.240
And maybe we have to accept that, in fact,

44:22.320 --> 44:25.920
that life doesn't always turn out
as you would expect it to.

44:26.440 --> 44:29.560
That's how it is.
You don't have to lose the plot.

44:30.120 --> 44:31.760
How have I lost the plot?

44:31.840 --> 44:34.280
- Well, I mean--
- No, but tell me when I've lost the plot.

44:34.360 --> 44:36.680
I've got no concrete examples, okay?
I haven't.

44:36.760 --> 44:39.280
- Oh? No.
- But you have, even if no one sees it.

44:43.560 --> 44:46.520
It's okay to have control,
but you're not realistic.

44:47.360 --> 44:48.360
Do you know what?

44:49.680 --> 44:52.360
It'd be a relief
to let go of responsibility.

44:56.880 --> 44:57.880
Mmm?

44:58.760 --> 45:00.320
I'm happy to let go.

45:01.080 --> 45:02.560
You can take over.

45:06.840 --> 45:10.000
I think I'll just go to bed now.

45:23.640 --> 45:25.080
Where are the toothbrushes?

46:53.480 --> 46:55.880
Why is Daddy sleeping on the sofa?

46:55.960 --> 46:59.160
So you can sleep here. Come here, honey.

47:14.680 --> 47:15.800
I love you.

47:18.280 --> 47:22.760
Every time you say you love me,
I double it.

47:34.560 --> 47:35.920
Have you picked a theme?

47:36.000 --> 47:37.240
Er, yeah.

47:37.320 --> 47:39.960
Yeah? Great.
Thank you, I'll take that.

47:41.240 --> 47:43.080
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

47:43.160 --> 47:47.080
You can rehearse in ten minutes
in the gym across from the car park.

47:47.720 --> 47:49.520
- Mmm-hmm.
- Are you going to bring anyone else?

47:49.600 --> 47:52.160
- No.
- No. Good. Thank you.

47:54.840 --> 47:56.920
- All good?
- Yeah, I'm going to rehearse.

47:57.000 --> 47:58.920
- Do you want me to come?
- No.

47:59.440 --> 48:01.000
- Okay.
- Well, that told you.

48:01.080 --> 48:03.560
Message me when you're done.
We'll wait for you.

48:03.640 --> 48:05.320
We're not waiting in the hallway.

48:06.600 --> 48:09.560
- How will she get home?
- She can ring and I'll come get her.

48:09.640 --> 48:12.680
- I'm not waiting here.
- Okay. All right.

48:12.760 --> 48:15.880
- Hello! Hi! Hi!
- Okay.

48:15.960 --> 48:17.080
- Hi! Bye.
- Hi!

48:17.160 --> 48:19.960
Wait a sec. I'm so very glad you're here.

48:20.040 --> 48:23.080
Erm, we could do
with a little help in there.

48:23.160 --> 48:25.800
I mean,
if you're not too busy at the moment?

48:25.880 --> 48:28.040
Er…

48:28.960 --> 48:31.560
No, no, no! That's…
You pulled it too tight.

48:31.640 --> 48:33.040
That's too tight.

48:33.120 --> 48:35.320
Give it some slack. It needs to be looser.

48:35.400 --> 48:36.480
Yeah, that's it.

48:36.560 --> 48:37.840
- Looser.
- But now…

48:37.920 --> 48:40.240
No, no. Now you gave it too much slack.

48:40.320 --> 48:42.520
It's too loose. It needs…
It needs to go up.

48:42.600 --> 48:44.960
Three centimetres up. Three centimetres.

48:45.040 --> 48:48.720
Everything changed when I was
selected to compete in Bologna

48:48.800 --> 48:51.240
- at the Piazza Manfredi in 2012.
- Mmm.

48:51.320 --> 48:54.560
We need to have a talk
about the elephant in the room.

48:54.640 --> 48:58.520
As a man, it's so difficult
to watch a bunch of teenage girls

48:58.600 --> 49:00.960
writhing around a pole.

49:02.760 --> 49:06.800
- Yet you do it?
- Yes and no.

49:06.880 --> 49:08.440
I close my eyes.

49:09.760 --> 49:11.880
- You close your eyes?
- Yes, I do.

49:11.960 --> 49:13.280
I close them.

49:14.240 --> 49:17.920
I'm there.
"Frank, think of something else."

49:19.280 --> 49:22.440
Things you do for the people you love.

49:32.160 --> 49:34.480
Sorry, do you, er, want a hand with that?

49:35.120 --> 49:37.400
No, hell no. I have my methods.

49:38.200 --> 49:39.640
She thinks I'm helping,

49:39.720 --> 49:44.160
but really I'm just sitting here
feeling the knot while she's working.

49:44.240 --> 49:46.240
"Frank, help me with the backdrop."

49:46.320 --> 49:49.040
"Absolutely," I say without thinking.

49:49.120 --> 49:52.600
I'm happy, she's happy, and life is easy.

49:55.440 --> 49:58.760
The problem is that people aren't happy
with easy anymore.

49:58.840 --> 50:01.160
- The goal posts move all the time.
- Mmm.

50:01.240 --> 50:03.480
You know, you see a Merc, and think,

50:03.560 --> 50:08.200
"Fuck, life would be fine
if I could drive that every day to work."

50:08.280 --> 50:11.360
"If I had that Merc,
life would be so different."

50:11.440 --> 50:15.560
The problem is eventually
that car will start breaking down.

50:15.640 --> 50:18.720
At least I can fix my Saab,
you know what I mean?

50:18.800 --> 50:19.920
Yeah. Yeah.

50:20.000 --> 50:23.880
Frank! Stop fiddling
with that knot and give me a hand!

50:23.960 --> 50:26.960
My Saab is always breaking down,

50:27.680 --> 50:29.640
but I fucking love that car.

50:29.720 --> 50:32.840
He's unbelievable.
Completely useless.

50:32.920 --> 50:34.840
But, anyway, let's unpack these.

50:34.920 --> 50:38.560
Frank, give me a hand!

50:38.640 --> 50:40.560
- Frank!
- Yeah, yeah, I'm coming.

50:40.640 --> 50:43.000
- Keep your hair on.
- Just hold this up, would you?

50:43.080 --> 50:44.520
Like this, my love?

50:51.640 --> 50:52.680
Hey.

50:53.400 --> 50:54.880
- You okay?
- Mmm.

50:56.240 --> 50:58.360
- You?
- Yeah, fine.

51:03.400 --> 51:07.960
I had, erm, a little conversation
with an extremely odd person.

51:08.040 --> 51:09.040
Mmm.

51:09.680 --> 51:11.840
He's probably no odder than she is.

51:13.080 --> 51:15.640
Have you met your match?

51:19.360 --> 51:22.680
No, I mean that
she is a very special person.

51:23.200 --> 51:25.040
Look, I'll show you. She has…

51:26.600 --> 51:30.440
She's actually made all of these herself.

51:30.520 --> 51:31.520
Look at that.

51:32.720 --> 51:33.880
Pole Trolls.

51:36.760 --> 51:38.560
It's incredible.

51:51.160 --> 51:52.680
Are you not feeling very well?

51:54.080 --> 51:56.880
No, I think I just need
to eat something actually.

51:57.800 --> 52:00.360
- I'll get you something to eat.
- Mmm.

52:00.440 --> 52:01.520
You'll feel better.

52:04.640 --> 52:08.680
This is a lucky troll.

52:08.760 --> 52:10.160
Isn't it lovely?

52:10.240 --> 52:13.720
This is for you, as a thank you
for helping out today.

52:13.800 --> 52:17.040
Or give it to your daughter, will you?
She might have need of it.

52:17.120 --> 52:19.240
It's a hard competition this year.

52:20.640 --> 52:22.640
We'll see you at the opening
ceremony tonight.

52:22.720 --> 52:24.280
- Right?
- Absolutely!

52:24.360 --> 52:26.280
Sorry, I just have to…

53:13.240 --> 53:15.840
MORPHINE

53:42.760 --> 53:46.200
WHAT DO I TELL THE CHILDREN?
THE SWEDISH CANCER SOCIETY

53:49.000 --> 53:51.240
Why would I want to go
to a fucking kickoff party?

53:51.320 --> 53:53.160
- What should I have said then, no?
- Yeah!

53:53.240 --> 53:54.280
Well, I didn't, all right?

53:54.360 --> 53:57.200
And now we're going to the kickoff,
the whole family.

53:57.280 --> 54:00.200
I can't wait.
It's my ultimate dream.

54:00.960 --> 54:02.840
Try and be excited.

54:02.920 --> 54:06.440
There was no, er,
mustard I'm afraid, so, uh…

54:07.920 --> 54:09.360
It's a bit sad.

54:09.440 --> 54:10.520
Mummy?

54:15.200 --> 54:16.200
Mummy!

54:20.600 --> 54:23.720
- Mummy, why aren't you listening?
- Manne, come on.

54:24.320 --> 54:25.320
Hello?

54:29.360 --> 54:30.600
Come on.

54:30.680 --> 54:31.760
In we get, okay?

54:33.160 --> 54:35.920
- Why's Mummy acting funny, Daddy?
- Seat belt.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.000
Okay.

54:48.040 --> 54:48.960
Are you okay?

54:50.000 --> 54:51.000
Mmm.

54:57.800 --> 55:02.240
Now, erm, you'll feel much better
once you've eaten that rubbish.

55:02.760 --> 55:05.040
You know you can trust me. I'm a doctor.

55:05.840 --> 55:06.960
Come on.

57:06.440 --> 57:09.200
- Are you feeling any better?
- Mmm-hmm.

57:12.000 --> 57:13.760
Do you want some help with that?

57:15.120 --> 57:16.400
Yeah, go on.

57:41.280 --> 57:43.600
<i>♪ This is gold ♪</i>

57:45.720 --> 57:47.840
<i>♪ This is gold ♪</i>

57:48.360 --> 57:54.680
<i>♪ I'll show you</i>
<i>This is gold and I just know it ♪</i>

57:54.760 --> 57:56.640
<i>♪ We will glow ♪</i>

57:56.720 --> 57:58.920
<i>♪ Oh, this is gold… ♪</i>

57:59.000 --> 58:00.000
So…

58:02.080 --> 58:03.120
Thank you.

58:24.960 --> 58:27.560
- Carry me, Mummy!
- I can't, my love.

58:27.640 --> 58:28.960
Come. Come, come.

58:34.840 --> 58:38.480
If anyone asks, you're not here with me.

58:39.080 --> 58:40.160
Of course.

58:45.160 --> 58:47.920
Hang on.
Looks like they've only got pizza.

58:48.000 --> 58:49.760
Did you bring his bag?

58:49.840 --> 58:52.360
Er, I must have…

58:52.440 --> 58:54.360
So you didn't. Okay.

58:54.440 --> 58:55.600
You know what, honey?

58:55.680 --> 58:58.760
You stay put with Dad,
and I'll go get the bag with the food.

58:58.840 --> 59:00.400
But I want to go with you.

59:00.480 --> 59:02.160
- Yes, but--
- Wait, wait, wait.

59:02.240 --> 59:04.560
They might have something
gluten free on their menu.

59:04.640 --> 59:05.920
Shall we go and ask them?

59:06.000 --> 59:08.200
I doubt it. Give me the car keys.

59:08.280 --> 59:10.680
I'll deal with this,
and I'll have a word with them, and…

59:10.760 --> 59:13.920
Can you just give me the bloody keys?

59:15.760 --> 59:20.720
Now we're in the exactly the situation
we talked about yesterday, do you see?

59:21.640 --> 59:23.040
He says he needs to eat.

59:23.120 --> 59:27.080
And so just because of that,
your entire world falls apart.

59:28.000 --> 59:30.720
Please don't lose the plot over this.

59:30.800 --> 59:35.120
Please, Stella,
just try to let go for once.

59:37.360 --> 59:39.640
You have to let go, Stella, please.

59:43.840 --> 59:44.840
Okay.

59:47.680 --> 59:49.960
- Okay?
- Okay. I'll let go.

59:51.040 --> 59:52.040
Good.

59:52.840 --> 59:55.680
- Can you look after that? And that?
- Yes.

59:55.760 --> 59:56.880
So, er…

01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:04.240
I'll go to the bar
and order myself a drink then.

01:00:06.080 --> 01:00:08.120
- That sounds like a good idea.
- Mmm.

01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:11.960
Okay, then.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:15.760
- So you'll have to drive home.
- Let go, please.

01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:17.000
Yep.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.920
- Are you competing?
- Well, why do you ask?

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:24.920
Are you really?

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.440
Yeah, really.

01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.800
Got my game face on.

01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:30.600
Ah. Okay.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:34.320
- Okay, erm…
- You got a theme?

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.920
- Yeah…
- Okay?

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.160
Don't want to say what it is?

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.960
Wait, sorry.
See that woman there?

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:52.000
What the hell is she wearing?

01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:54.600
You'd think, like, this whole event
has been organised for her

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:58.000
to show off to everyone,
not for the competition.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:01.560
She's okay being the centre of attention.

01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:03.760
Okay, where is Gabbe?
I'll sort it.

01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:05.920
She's coming over. She's coming.

01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:10.000
Your dad needs more cases of beer, okay?

01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:12.040
- Hi!
- Hey.

01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:17.560
Hey, you!
I'm so glad you could make it! Hi!

01:01:37.360 --> 01:01:38.480
Cheers!

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.080
No. No, no, no, Manne. Come on.
It's really dirty on the floor down there.

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.400
I'm hungry.

01:01:49.480 --> 01:01:52.560
- Sit down and we'll order. Let's order.
- Let go! Let go of me!

01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:54.840
He's coming over now. Let's get food.

01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.160
Hey, hey, hey.

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:01.440
Erm, we were wondering
if you have anything without gluten.

01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:02.600
Gluten free?

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.960
We have pizza.

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.840
Yeah, I know you do.

01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:08.200
That's, erm…

01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:12.960
Well, that's the problem,
because it's bread.

01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:17.240
Yeah. You want something without bread?
Like pizza without bread?

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:18.320
Yeah.

01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:20.560
So just cheese?

01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:23.760
Cheese would be okay. Erm…

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.800
Listen, whatever it is, just make sure
that it doesn't contain gluten in it.

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:27.880
Thanks a lot.

01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:33.040
I feel like I'm…
I'm swaying.

01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:43.960
Fuck, I'm sorry.

01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.880
- I didn't know that was your mum.
- Don't worry.

01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:47.080
Do you want one?

01:02:47.800 --> 01:02:48.920
Are you all right?

01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:06.720
When did you start practising?

01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:09.480
Erm, quite recently.

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.000
You?

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:13.280
Since I was a baby.

01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:15.400
Well, not really, but you know.

01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:19.400
I do it for my mum.

01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:23.160
I know it sounds cheesy, but…

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.120
she's had some tough times.

01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:32.920
All this, this whole thing,
means so much to her.

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.200
And I…

01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:39.520
Well, if she's happy…

01:03:40.560 --> 01:03:43.280
- Yeah.
- I don't think it sounds cheesy.

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:47.640
My act is about mutual support,

01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:52.560
but it really feels so fucking fake.

01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:53.760
Why?

01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.560
It's not like we're really
supporting each other just now.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:02.320
You see, my mum and dad
aren't getting on at the moment.

01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.400
Mmm.

01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.200
And then I want to do this,
and they don't think it's appropriate.

01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:08.400
No, it isn't.

01:04:10.040 --> 01:04:11.080
Why not?

01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:17.800
Don't get me wrong, but for you girls,
it's all connected to striptease.

01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:19.640
Why is that?

01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.720
Because you're pole dancing.

01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.600
Moving around.

01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.000
Yeah, but…

01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:29.840
Fuck you. What about midsummer festivals?

01:04:29.920 --> 01:04:33.120
- Yeah.
- You don't call that stripping, or do you?

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.880
No, maybe not.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.320
- Cheese.
- Right.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:50.440
Thank you. That worked out really well.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.600
Erm…

01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:55.200
Manne…

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.200
Manne?

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:25.440
<i>♪ The brightest light that shines ♪</i>

01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:29.240

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.960

01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:49.480
Sorry, I think that your son
needs your help.

01:05:49.560 --> 01:05:51.440
Okay. Thank you.

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.160
Come and dance with me.

01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:55.480
- Yeah, I've gotta…
- Come on.

01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:57.120
I'll be right back.

01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:05.760
Oh, dear. Hey. Hey, what's up?

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:10.280
- I just wanted to try it.
- Okay. It's okay. Okay.

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:12.280
Whoa. It's all right.

01:06:12.360 --> 01:06:13.920
Whatever it is, we can fix it.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.720
Tell Mummy. She knows what to do.

01:06:16.800 --> 01:06:19.760
Yeah, but Daddy also know what to do.
Come on, let's go.

01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:21.680
Ow.

01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.120
What happened?

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.440
He had some pizza,
so I'll have to take him in.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.720
- Where to?
- Ow.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.560
- To the hospital.
- Why? What about Mum?

01:06:35.640 --> 01:06:37.360
- What did you say?
- Where's Mum?

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:40.360
Uh, she's in there. She…

01:06:40.920 --> 01:06:42.120
She's…

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:45.720
She's letting go.
Tell her. Tell her where we went.

01:06:48.360 --> 01:06:49.680
What the fuck?

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.120
What the fuck?
I told you not to embarrass me.

01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:07.320
- Honey--
- I hate you! Get off me!

01:07:07.400 --> 01:07:10.960
Yeah. Thanks, I know.
You say it every day. I've got it, Anna.

01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:12.480
<i>Is it…</i>

01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:15.720
Is it supposed to hurt this much?
It doesn't seem right that it's this bad.

01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:18.480
- Ow!
- You said that he was gluten intolerant?

01:07:18.560 --> 01:07:20.080
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:23.600
- Then that's probably what's not right.
- Ow!

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.440
Okay, you'll be all right.

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:28.160
Manne, can I feel your tummy?

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:30.320
No!

01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:33.920
She's just going to
feel it very gently. It'll be very gentle.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000
I promise it won't hurt.
It'll be all right.

01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:37.560
There we go. Good boy.

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:41.600
- Mummy!
- Don't worry, we'll be all done here soon.

01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:43.880
Let's feel it.

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:46.440
It's all right.

01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:49.520
You're doing so well! So well!

01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:51.440
It's okay.

01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:54.840
- Okay. There. All done.
- Ow!

01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:56.600
- Yeah. There we are.
- She's all finished.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:59.960
I mean, if you're gluten intolerant,
it can hurt like this.

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:01.760
- But Manne will be fine.
- Yeah?

01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:04.760
I'll get you some fluid replacement
that you can take home.

01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.240
- Okay.
- I'll be back in a minute.

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:08.000
- In a minute? Yeah.
- Yup.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:10.240
Okay, hear what she said, a minute?

01:08:10.320 --> 01:08:13.280
That's 60 seconds.
Shall we count down from 60?

01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.760
- All right. Okay. So, 60…
- Mmm-hmm. 60…

01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:23.360
Fifty-nine, fifty-eight,
fifty-seven, fifty-six…

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:27.400
Fifty-five, that's it.

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:31.200
- I can't count any more backwards.
- No, no, but I can do it.

01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:33.920
- Fifty-four--
- I'm going to poo myself.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.440
He's not answering.

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.400
Fuck!

01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:39.440
Because you threw his phone on the ground
and stamped on it, for God's sake.

01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:43.320
- Can you stop being so angry with me?
- Stop being so horrible.

01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.200
How am I so horrible?

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:47.600
Can you explain to me what I do wrong?

01:08:47.680 --> 01:08:52.240
You do everything wrong, Mum,
just everything. You're always on at me.

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:55.600
You're always on at everyone else too!
And you're always nagging.

01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:58.080
It's like you don't give a fuck
what we really want.

01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:00.240
Well, trust me, I do, Anna.

01:09:00.320 --> 01:09:02.400
I didn't… I didn't want you to come here.

01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:04.720
I'm okay on my own, for fuck's sake.

01:09:04.800 --> 01:09:08.840
You want to be with me all the time!
You don't leave me alone for a second!

01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:10.560
It's like you…

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:14.200
Stop controlling my life!
You're suffocating me! Suffocating me!

01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:18.440
You're constantly worried about losing me
and it's doing my fucking head in!

01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:21.280
You have to realise I'm growing up.

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:23.440
- You need to deal with that!
- You know what, honey?

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:25.840
I know that you're growing up.

01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:27.520
Okay?

01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.280
I'm sorry.

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:34.840
I'm sorry if I embarrassed you in there.
I didn't mean to at all.

01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:39.680
I was trying to have a good time.

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:42.560
But I fucked up. I'm sorry.

01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:48.160
But do you know what, Anna?
I'm only human. I fail sometimes.

01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:51.240
Honey, I want…

01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:53.520
I just want to be part of your life.

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.680
You see, I…

01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:02.560
I really want you to know that
whatever you do, I'm here for you, Anna.

01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:03.720
You should know that.

01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:07.720
We are. We are here for you.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.840
Whatever happens,

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:14.320
I'm always so proud of you, darling.

01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.240
I really want you to know that.

01:10:20.600 --> 01:10:22.280
You know we can't always be together.

01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:23.840
Yeah.

01:10:24.560 --> 01:10:25.880
I realise that.

01:10:26.560 --> 01:10:27.880
You say you do.

01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:31.320

Yeah, well…

01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:12.760
If you hadn't pulled me up on stage,
you could've won it.

01:26:12.840 --> 01:26:15.320
- Fuck, that was great!
- Don't swear!

01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:17.520
No, no, but, oh, my God,
that was insane, both of you!

01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:19.360
- Honey!
- I mean, I mean…

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:20.840
We are… I mean, we are…

01:26:21.440 --> 01:26:23.240
We are so happy.

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:27.440
- Amazing, Anna!
- Hi! Hi!

01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:32.160
You were so good at the stripping!

01:26:32.240 --> 01:26:34.120
- My God, Anna.
- Thanks.

01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:36.600
You could've sat with us.
That would have been nice.

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:39.720
I was here to see Anna, not you.

01:26:39.800 --> 01:26:42.680
Ah, well, message received.
Let's celebrate.

01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:44.080
Let's go. What do you want to do?

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:46.480
Is it okay
if I celebrate with Gabriel instead?

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:48.680
But we're here
and want to celebrate with you, Anna.

01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:51.120
It's okay. Let her go.

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:54.640
Okay. It's up to you.

01:26:57.160 --> 01:26:59.280
We'll give you a… a stupid amount of cash.

01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.200
- Shall we eat something?
- Yeah.

01:27:03.280 --> 01:27:04.840
Okay, so you, then. What'll we do?

01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:07.760
- I want to go with Grandma.
- Do you now?

01:27:07.840 --> 01:27:09.280
Honey, another day.

01:27:09.360 --> 01:27:12.880
- Grandma's busy, you know?
- No, I'm not busy at all, sweetheart.

01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:15.640
- Of course you can come back to mine.
- Yay!

01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:17.160
You can get him tomorrow.

01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:19.480
We should take him, probably.

01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:21.320
You need some alone time.

01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:23.520
We'll see you tomorrow.

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.840
- You want to go? Yeah?
- Come on! Yeah?

01:27:26.920 --> 01:27:29.720
Let's go home
and play cards with Granddad.

01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:30.800
Mmm.

01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:32.080
Bye, honey.

01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:36.120
Oi, oi! Hello, hello, hello, hello…

01:27:36.640 --> 01:27:38.960
- This is the bag with his food.
- Yes.

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:40.920
So, please don't take any chances.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.120
- I have Googled it. It'll be all right.
- Well, okay.

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:45.880
Okay, great.

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:49.760
Bye-bye!

01:27:56.600 --> 01:27:58.680
- She's Googled it.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:03.160
So it'll be a disaster.

01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:07.560
She's a liability.

01:28:08.080 --> 01:28:09.320
You can't just give her an iPad

01:28:09.400 --> 01:28:11.400
and hope that it's all
gonna work out for the best.

01:28:11.480 --> 01:28:12.720
Stop!

01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:15.320
Okay. Oh, well.

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:18.320
- It's been a while since we sat like this…
- Mmm.

01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:19.400
…just us two.

01:28:19.480 --> 01:28:21.680
With nobody to interrupt.
It feels unusual.

01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:23.520
Mmm. But I can help.

01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:27.760
I can do something distracting
to make you feel at home.

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.000
What happened to us?

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:45.520
How did we get here?

01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:49.840
I realise that you, um…

01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:54.160
Er, you don't love me anymore.

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:56.920
You haven't for some time now.

01:28:59.480 --> 01:29:00.720
But I have tried.

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:04.880
I've tried to understand it.

01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:09.720
Why you are so…

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:12.440
always angry with me.

01:29:14.600 --> 01:29:16.000
- You hate me.
- No.

01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:19.360
- I don't hate you.
- Yes, you do. You hate me.

01:29:20.360 --> 01:29:23.800
But at the same time,
you can't, er, let me go.

01:29:26.160 --> 01:29:27.640
I… I just don't know anymore.

01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:29.160
No, I understand that.

01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:35.040
I don't really understand myself
why I've been so angry.

01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:39.560
And I have been so angry with you.

01:29:42.720 --> 01:29:44.040
And that's not fair.

01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:47.880
I suppose I got stuck…

01:29:48.760 --> 01:29:51.320
fighting in Mummy corner, and, erm…

01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:55.200
And that's not your fault.
You never asked that of me, but, er…

01:29:58.880 --> 01:30:04.200
I think I've felt
so disappointed with you because…

01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:08.280
because it seems like you don't see
what I've done for this family.

01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:09.800
It's not that I don't see.

01:30:12.560 --> 01:30:14.040
Yeah, I…

01:30:15.920 --> 01:30:16.920
Er…

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:22.080
I think I have, like, er,
a really pathetic,

01:30:22.160 --> 01:30:24.200
and sadly very common,

01:30:25.600 --> 01:30:26.640
male problem.

01:30:28.720 --> 01:30:29.640
Er…

01:30:30.200 --> 01:30:33.880
That, er, I can't handle

01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:38.040
the children getting all the attention.

01:30:39.880 --> 01:30:41.600
It's that simple and stupid.

01:30:43.800 --> 01:30:45.920
And I began to, er…

01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:50.520
to feel a bit empty.

01:30:50.600 --> 01:30:52.400
I began to miss you.

01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:55.720
I also felt I was getting in the way.

01:30:57.080 --> 01:31:00.440
And so I thought
it was for the best if I just…

01:31:01.320 --> 01:31:07.000
It was best for all of us if I just
quietly went away and said goodbye.

01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:11.640
Everything I did was wrong.

01:31:12.320 --> 01:31:14.120
As you correctly pointed out.

01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:15.560
But it's also…

01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:17.520
Ugh.

01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:19.440
…so fucking dumb.

01:31:20.120 --> 01:31:22.720
No one gets better
just by nagging them, do they?

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:25.360
- I don't know, maybe you do.
- And maybe you don't either.

01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:28.680
It's not that I enjoy nagging you
or that I'm trying to cast blame.

01:31:29.440 --> 01:31:30.520
You do know that?

01:31:31.080 --> 01:31:32.320
Yeah, course I do.

01:31:34.040 --> 01:31:37.120
But I think
we both know by now that I really…

01:31:39.320 --> 01:31:40.360
I deserved it.

01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:44.240
Recently, anyway.

01:31:44.320 --> 01:31:46.400
I have been so stupid.

01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:49.200
And really useless.

01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:51.000
No, don't say that.

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:56.120
You aren't useless.

01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:00.240
Hey.

01:32:01.520 --> 01:32:02.720
You're not.

01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:07.280
I miss you.

01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:11.920
I miss us.

01:32:13.280 --> 01:32:14.640
What we once were.

01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:19.520
Do you remember?

01:32:20.640 --> 01:32:21.680
Yeah.

01:32:22.240 --> 01:32:24.560
It was so fucking good.

01:32:25.400 --> 01:32:26.400
Mmm.

01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:29.240
- Yeah, it was great.
- It was so great.

01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:32.040
So fucking great.

01:32:33.920 --> 01:32:37.160
And now we're sitting here
and everything's gone to hell, Stella.

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:45.080
It's harder to fight than you realise
when you don't feel seen.

01:32:45.800 --> 01:32:47.040
But I see you.

01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:51.960
Believe me, I see you.

01:32:54.320 --> 01:32:57.840
- Yeah.
- I see what you've done for this family.

01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:06.760
And I'm very, very sorry
for what I've put you through.

01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:09.360
And what I've done to our family.

01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:17.680
I understand if you don't want me back.

01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:31.240
You know what?

01:33:36.960 --> 01:33:38.360
If you're happy with her…

01:33:39.840 --> 01:33:42.560
- Then I'm happy for you.
- Can you please not say things like that?

01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:43.840
- Really, Stella.
- I mean it.

01:33:48.520 --> 01:33:51.080
I don't know how to say this,
but whatever happens--

01:33:51.160 --> 01:33:52.320
Look, whatever happens,

01:33:53.360 --> 01:33:55.480
can we just not talk about it now?

01:33:58.200 --> 01:33:59.280
Not right now.

01:34:02.120 --> 01:34:03.800
Could we just maybe,

01:34:04.880 --> 01:34:05.880
for now,

01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:07.920
forget about it…

01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:11.160
and make the most of tonight?

01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:16.040
Let's enjoy tonight
and make the most of it. You and me.

01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:19.880
Here and now.

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:22.680
Can we do that?

01:34:23.560 --> 01:34:24.560
Okay.

01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:30.320
Okay.

01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:18.000
Hi.

01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:20.960
I was just going to wake you up.

01:36:25.720 --> 01:36:28.520
- What time is it?
- It's quarter past one.

01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:31.320
- What?
- The car's all packed.

01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.720
Mum dropped off Manne,
so the kids are all ready.

01:36:34.800 --> 01:36:36.920
Take your time.

01:36:38.280 --> 01:36:39.400
Everything's done.

01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:42.920
Come out when you're ready. We'll wait.

01:37:00.560 --> 01:37:02.400
How many legs for an alien?

01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:05.240
How long's a piece of string?

01:37:05.320 --> 01:37:08.160
- How would I know that?
- I don't know!

01:37:08.240 --> 01:37:11.280
Er, Mummy,
how many legs does an alien have?

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:17.520
It's impossible to really know
about aliens, Manne, because, well…

01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:19.800
no one's ever seen one of them.

01:37:20.440 --> 01:37:22.680
I think that they have two of them,
Manne, actually.

01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:26.200
Okay.

01:38:11.800 --> 01:38:13.680
Mum, can you come, please?

01:38:13.760 --> 01:38:15.680
I'll be with you in a sec, Anna.

01:38:15.760 --> 01:38:17.760
I just need to put Manne to bed.

01:38:41.360 --> 01:38:42.520
Can we have a talk?

01:38:49.320 --> 01:38:50.360
Stella…

01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:04.840
Hey.

01:39:09.160 --> 01:39:10.160
Come on.

01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:21.920
I know it will take time.

01:39:22.680 --> 01:39:24.440
And I know I don't deserve it.

01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:31.080
I'm so sorry. I don't know what to say.

01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:38.040
I'll do anything for you, Stella.

01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:40.680
Do you hear?

01:39:41.800 --> 01:39:43.320
It's too late.

01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:47.440
No.

01:39:47.960 --> 01:39:49.600
Gustav, listen to me.

01:39:50.360 --> 01:39:51.520
I'm not well.

01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:59.120
- I have cancer.
- No, no…

01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:02.240
Everything…
Everything will be okay.

01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:04.120
It's okay.

01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:16.600
<i>As a mother, your job is to say</i>
<i>that everything will be all right.</i>

01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:19.120
<i>Even if you know it won't be.</i>

01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:33.080
They say
you can't start processing it

01:40:33.160 --> 01:40:34.920
until you've told your family.

01:40:40.280 --> 01:40:41.280
And…

01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:45.840
I should have done it straight away.

01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:51.800
I know it was cowardly and wrong.

01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:57.880
But I couldn't do it.

01:41:00.920 --> 01:41:02.040
I wasn't brave enough.

01:41:05.640 --> 01:41:11.040
I thought my biggest fear
was being left by the one I love.

01:41:13.280 --> 01:41:16.640
But now I know
that it's a hundred times worse

01:41:17.240 --> 01:41:18.760
to leave the ones you love.

01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:24.880
Because I was so bloody afraid
of what would happen when I wasn't there.

01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:30.520
<i>I was afraid the children</i>
<i>would feel guilty about me, and…</i>

01:41:32.400 --> 01:41:34.720
<i>and children</i>
<i>shouldn't have to go through that.</i>

01:41:36.320 --> 01:41:38.280
They shouldn't have to go through that.

01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:46.480
I was afraid
my husband would feel sorry for me…

01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:50.800
and stay with me for the wrong reason.

01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:53.240
- <i>Wool?</i>
- <i>Yeah, I have.</i>

01:41:53.320 --> 01:41:56.120
- There's no wool in hot pants.
- I have. There can be.

01:41:56.200 --> 01:41:58.280
<i>I was afraid about how…</i>

01:41:58.360 --> 01:42:01.760
<i>how he would cope with everything</i>
<i>without me there.</i>

01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:05.680
<i>I was afraid</i>
<i>of how the children would react.</i>

01:42:05.760 --> 01:42:06.960
<i>I was afraid they…</i>

01:42:08.200 --> 01:42:11.040
<i>How the hell</i>
<i>would they cope with everything?</i>

01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:14.720
<i>I was afraid they would feel alone.</i>

01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:19.880
<i>I was afraid of everything.</i>

01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:20.960
Hi.

01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:27.800
But I realise
our children are in a good place.

01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:31.680
That's all I've ever cared about.

01:42:36.040 --> 01:42:39.040
Shall we
go Christmas shopping now?

01:42:39.960 --> 01:42:42.000
<i>I know that they are surrounded</i>

01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:45.400
<i>by people who love them</i>
<i>more than life itself.</i>

01:42:45.920 --> 01:42:47.960
- I'll see you soon.
- Anna, you coming?

01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:56.680
<i>And that those of you</i>
<i>who are still here</i>

01:42:56.760 --> 01:42:58.400
<i>will take care of everything.</i>

01:42:58.480 --> 01:42:59.600
Come.

01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:04.000
<i>I know that you're here.</i>

01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:06.600
<i>All of you.</i>

01:43:08.040 --> 01:43:09.160
<i>For them.</i>

01:43:09.240 --> 01:43:10.360
I love you.

01:43:13.880 --> 01:43:16.160
Every time you say it, I double it.

01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:29.560
<i>That I won't</i>
<i>soon be a part of the…</i>

01:43:31.120 --> 01:43:35.400
chaotic life of our amazing family…

01:43:38.320 --> 01:43:42.520
I can't express how sad I am
about having to leave you.

01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.680
But I'm not afraid now.

01:43:53.800 --> 01:43:55.240
You're gonna be all right.

01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:17.600
- Yeah!
- Okay, we have to go.

01:44:17.680 --> 01:44:19.440
- We have to go, yeah?
- Yeah!

01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:22.280
- Have you got your pole?
- Yes.

01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:27.080
- And your hot pants?
- Yeah! Stop nagging me!

01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:45.160
Up!

01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:48.640
And down.

01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:52.160
Up…

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.560
- Hi, Grandma.
- And down.

01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:57.640
- Hi, Anna, darling.
- Hi, Grandpa.

01:44:57.720 --> 01:45:00.720
Superpowers! Will you please have a look?

01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:03.360
Yeah! Come.

01:45:04.480 --> 01:45:06.280
Blink if you have superpowers.

01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:10.280
I knew it! I told you he had superpowers.

01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:14.080
Great! But can you stop harassing
Granddad and get in? Come here. Come on.

01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:19.040
Put your seat belt on.
I'll give you these.

01:45:20.560 --> 01:45:23.120
- What are you doing?
- You're sitting on Gorgor!

01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:26.560
- Don't hit me, all right?
- Daddy, Anna is being mean.

01:45:26.640 --> 01:45:28.600
- Yeah?
- I didn't do anything to him.

01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:31.160
You are being mean,
you're sitting on Gorgor.

01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:34.520
Grab that.

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:36.200
Let's just do this.

01:45:36.280 --> 01:45:37.800
Okay!

01:45:37.880 --> 01:45:41.600
Nine hours and forty-five minutes.
Okay, everyone?

01:45:41.680 --> 01:45:43.520
Yep! Thanks, Mum. That's great.

01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:48.040
I can't see a problem. We just
love riding in a car for nearly ten hours.

01:45:48.640 --> 01:45:49.640
All good.

01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:52.040
Ten hours. Just great.

01:45:55.040 --> 01:45:56.320
It'll be great.
