00:08.791 --> 00:12.041
You found out you're a Variant
and you haven't even looked, have you?

00:12.125 --> 00:15.000
-You wanna be king?
-I don't want to be, I was born to be.

00:15.083 --> 00:18.083
That is what we know.
War. And it's on its way.

00:18.166 --> 00:20.250
-That's who you showed us?
-He Who Remains.

00:20.333 --> 00:21.708
This is his kingdom.

00:22.375 --> 00:24.708
HE WHO REMAINS: And that's the gambit.

00:24.791 --> 00:29.833
Take over, or an infinite amount of me
start another Multiversal War.

00:29.916 --> 00:32.625
And I just end up right back here anyways.

00:32.708 --> 00:34.666
Reincarnation, baby.

00:34.750 --> 00:35.750
Sylvie, stop.

00:35.833 --> 00:37.416
-You want the throne?
-(GRUNTS)

00:38.333 --> 00:39.416
See you soon.

LOKI: Now, for better or for worse,
the timelines are free.

00:41.875 --> 00:45.208
It's up to us to protect them,
to do better than He Who Remains.

00:45.291 --> 00:47.375
-We're playing God.
-What's the plan?

00:47.458 --> 00:49.958
Load the Multiplier,
launch it and get back.

00:50.041 --> 00:51.250
Time to be brave.

00:51.333 --> 00:52.541
(SCREAMS)

00:53.708 --> 00:56.875
SYLVIE: The branches are dying.
Everything's falling apart.

00:56.958 --> 01:00.541
I need to go back to before
the Temporal Loom melted down.

01:00.625 --> 01:03.208
You need to learn
how to control your time slipping.

02:12.000 --> 02:15.000
O.B.: Load the Multiplier,
launch it and get back.

02:15.083 --> 02:16.666
-Got it?
-TIMELY: Got it.

02:18.083 --> 02:19.416
Okay.

02:20.833 --> 02:22.250
Time to be brave.

02:23.291 --> 02:24.500
Good luck.

02:25.250 --> 02:26.791
Time to be brave.

02:36.666 --> 02:37.708
I'm back.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.250
-You okay?
-Yes. Yes.

02:39.333 --> 02:40.833
We have to get Timely out there.

02:47.166 --> 02:48.291
Ready.

02:48.375 --> 02:49.958
-SYLVIE: How long will he have?
-Not long.

02:50.041 --> 02:53.208
I don't know about this radiation level,
it's worse than when I was there.

02:53.291 --> 02:54.666

02:56.333 --> 02:57.708

03:27.333 --> 03:28.708
SYLVIE: He's gone.

03:28.791 --> 03:29.875
It's over.

03:29.958 --> 03:31.166
MOBIUS: Okay, what do we do?

03:31.250 --> 03:33.708
The Temporal Radiation is just too high.

03:33.791 --> 03:35.416
HUNTER B-15: What did we do wrong?

03:35.500 --> 03:38.250
CASEY: I don't know.
It wasn't me, I swear.

03:38.333 --> 03:39.916
-O.B.
-HUNTER B-15: Is he dead?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.833
What could we have done differently?

03:41.916 --> 03:43.083
O.B.: Good question.

03:45.000 --> 03:46.250
We took too long.

-Okay. No time to argue.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.416

-Good luck, professor.

Listen. Get in, get suited up. When...

04:02.583 --> 04:05.583
When those doors open,
get down the gangway as fast as you can.

04:05.666 --> 04:09.041
Load the Multiplier, hit the green button,
launch it and get back. Okay?

04:09.125 --> 04:10.500
-Okay.
-O.B.: That's exactly right.

04:10.583 --> 04:12.791
Let's keep moving.
Let's go faster this time.

04:12.875 --> 04:14.375

-Again. Not faster, earlier.
-SYLVIE: It's over.

Miss Ravonna, after what happened
in my workshop...

04:43.083 --> 04:46.250
Miss Minutes, I know right now
you're hurt and you're angry.

04:46.333 --> 04:49.250
But we need your help in finishing
the Throughput Multiplier, faster.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.041
Time is of the essence.

04:56.625 --> 04:59.125
I wasted time and now the time wastes me.

Don't set the Multiplier down.

this is Victor Timely.

05:28.583 --> 05:31.041

Isn't that amazing?

05:36.875 --> 05:37.958

-MOBIUS: Hey, hey.
-Nice to meet you!

05:42.458 --> 05:46.500
Here is a model of the Loom
which O.B. so helpfully mocked up.

05:46.583 --> 05:50.250
Everyone, Victor,
this model is not finished, okay?

05:50.333 --> 05:52.000
There's only one coat of paint on this.

05:52.083 --> 05:55.708
O.B., what are you talking about?
It's absolutely perfect.

05:55.791 --> 05:59.291
Now listen up. We have to get Timely
suited up and to the Loom.

05:59.375 --> 06:01.500
Wait... Why me?

06:01.583 --> 06:03.750
Because you volunteered,
you did, you will.

06:04.458 --> 06:07.416
Something could go wrong,
and you know how the Multiplier works.

06:07.500 --> 06:08.791
-I do.
-It'll make sense.

06:09.666 --> 06:12.291
You will wear this protective suit.

06:12.375 --> 06:13.708
Mobius, you're in luck.

06:13.791 --> 06:16.541
It looks like Mobius,
but it's actually Victor Timely.

06:16.625 --> 06:17.666
That's me?

06:17.750 --> 06:19.541
Victor, in this suit,
when those doors open,

06:19.625 --> 06:21.791
get down the gangway as fast as you can.

06:21.875 --> 06:23.125
It's gonna take some doing,

06:23.208 --> 06:25.458
-it's not gonna be easy.
-It's not gonna be easy...

06:26.958 --> 06:28.541
-Everyone following? Good.
-ALL: Yes.

06:29.166 --> 06:33.000
Victor, load the Multiplier
into the launcher, spin it,

06:33.083 --> 06:36.875
hit the green button, which will launch it
where it'll dock with the Loom

06:36.958 --> 06:40.291
and scale its capacity to manage
the backlog of branches.

06:40.375 --> 06:43.166
-O.B.: The Multiplier isn't ready yet.
-It is.

06:43.250 --> 06:46.916
-Because Timely has this.
-What's that...

06:47.500 --> 06:48.541
-A prototype...
-Yes.

06:48.625 --> 06:52.083
...which will widen the temporal input
and invert the temporal decay.

06:52.583 --> 06:55.375
This device,
plus the Throughput Multiplier,

06:55.458 --> 06:59.541
will make the rings bigger.

06:59.625 --> 07:01.666
-Loki, give...
-Give that back to the professor.

07:01.750 --> 07:03.625
Thank you so much. Trust me.

07:03.708 --> 07:05.958
It'll take time to adapt
my Throughput Multiplier...

07:06.041 --> 07:07.291
How long? How long?

07:07.666 --> 07:09.750
Depends. I don't even know
what I'm looking at.

07:09.833 --> 07:10.833
What is that?

07:10.916 --> 07:13.791
O.B., how long will it take me
to know everything that you know

07:13.875 --> 07:16.083
about mechanics, physics, and engineering?

07:16.166 --> 07:17.625
How much do you know?

07:18.541 --> 07:21.958
Let's assume I don't know much,
but I'm a fast learner and I'm a god.

-Let's start at the beginning.
-Start at the beginning.

07:24.583 --> 07:26.708
We don't have time.
It's better if we work alone.

07:26.791 --> 07:28.208
O.B., I understand.

07:28.291 --> 07:29.541
But if I had to know,

07:29.625 --> 07:31.916
I mean, I really, really,
really had to know,

07:32.000 --> 07:33.208
how long would it take?

07:34.208 --> 07:36.625
-Decades.
-Centuries.

07:47.375 --> 07:51.041
Loki, I'm not questioning your
surprisingly advanced engineering skills,

07:51.125 --> 07:53.083
but maybe O.B. should
test that thing first?

07:53.166 --> 07:55.708
Testing protocol is key to safe
scientific advancement.

07:55.791 --> 07:58.083
It's perfect. Timely, need you this way.

07:58.166 --> 08:01.333
We have to scan your Temporal Aura
in this fine machine.

Here's the plan. Get in, get suited up.

08:30.791 --> 08:33.500

get down the gangway as fast as you can.

Load the Multiplier, hit the green button,

08:35.541 --> 08:36.958

-Got it.

08:37.041 --> 08:38.625
By the way, remember,

08:38.708 --> 08:41.083
tape your right thumb, left knee,
and faceplate

08:41.166 --> 08:43.416
or the Temporal Radiation
will peel your skin off.

-Thumb, knee, faceplate.

08:46.458 --> 08:48.041
-One last thing.
-Yes.

08:48.125 --> 08:50.875
Whatever you do,
do not set the Multiplier down,

08:50.958 --> 08:53.750
or it will roll off the gangway.
Okay? Don't forget.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.500

08:57.000 --> 08:58.791

09:00.666 --> 09:04.458
LOKI: Casey, we need to widen the voltage
input and invert the temporal decay.

09:04.541 --> 09:06.500
-What about the ion decoupler?
-LOKI: It's fine.

09:06.583 --> 09:09.083
-Route it with the primary compartment.
-CASEY: Won't it overheat?

09:09.166 --> 09:13.166
No. Allow it to interface with Timely's
adaptive exponential computing system.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.083
Those upgrades will allow the Loom

09:15.166 --> 09:17.125
to scale the capacity
to manage the branches.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.625
The rings. Rings are too small.

09:19.708 --> 09:22.041
We're gonna make them bigger. Let's go.

That's right. I'm coming,
O.B., watch your back.

11:28.708 --> 11:32.666
Do not put the Multiplier down,
it will roll off the gangway.

28:44.916 --> 28:46.791
-Exactly, yeah.
-I know the dogma,

28:46.875 --> 28:48.791
but really, you're the one doing it.

28:48.875 --> 28:52.125
Because it was the proper flow of time.

28:52.208 --> 28:55.625
-What comfort is that?
-Comfort? Well, there's no comfort.

28:55.708 --> 28:58.208
You're not gonna find comfort at the TVA.

28:58.958 --> 29:01.833
You wanna hear a good story?
Listen to this one.

29:01.916 --> 29:05.416
A couple of Hunters went out on a mission
somewhere near the Black Sea

29:05.500 --> 29:09.166
to find a Variant who's gonna be
responsible for 5,000 deaths,

29:09.250 --> 29:12.875
5,000 deaths that were not
in the proper flow of time.

29:12.958 --> 29:15.708
They get there
and there's a little hiccup.

29:16.250 --> 29:18.791
The Variant is an eight-year-old boy.

29:19.833 --> 29:21.791
He was just minding his own business.

29:22.625 --> 29:25.833
Swimming with his brother,
jumping off the dock.

29:28.083 --> 29:31.416
And one of the Hunters
who never had trouble pruning before,

29:31.500 --> 29:35.125
he had never hesitated,
but that day he did.

29:35.208 --> 29:36.541
He paused.

29:37.041 --> 29:39.833
Timeline started to branch,
more Variants appeared.

29:39.916 --> 29:42.916
Happened so fast, his partner
had to step in and prune the kid.

29:43.000 --> 29:46.083
But by then, cat was out of the bag.

29:47.125 --> 29:48.583
Couple Hunters died.

29:49.166 --> 29:51.375
All because that one Hunter,

29:52.416 --> 29:54.375
he lost sight of the big picture.

29:55.833 --> 29:58.250
Gotta keep the big picture in mind.

30:00.750 --> 30:01.750
Hmm.

30:02.458 --> 30:06.416
Most purpose is more burden than glory.

30:07.166 --> 30:09.875
And trust me,
you never wanna be the guy who avoids it

30:09.958 --> 30:11.875
'cause you can't live with the burden.

30:16.625 --> 30:17.958
How do you live with it?

30:22.541 --> 30:24.000
Scar tissue.

30:26.958 --> 30:29.666
What happened to your partner?

30:30.875 --> 30:33.875
The Hunter who pruned the boy
when you couldn't.

30:33.958 --> 30:36.208
Oh, things worked out fine for her.

30:36.291 --> 30:37.750
She actually became a judge.

30:38.666 --> 30:43.500
You know, she's the reason you're here
instead of dust in a TVA vent.

30:46.333 --> 30:47.916
Renslayer.

30:48.000 --> 30:52.416
She knew the hard thing to do
was the thing that had to be done.

30:55.500 --> 30:57.791
And by hard, I mean impossible.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.125
No, there's no comfort.

31:01.833 --> 31:03.583
You just choose your burden.

31:08.250 --> 31:09.791
Thank you, Mobius.

31:49.750 --> 31:51.000
HUNTER B-15: Is this it?

31:52.750 --> 31:54.083
We... (WHIMPERS)

31:54.250 --> 31:55.333

31:57.500 --> 31:59.041
There's nowhere left to go.

32:09.875 --> 32:11.000
What's happening?

32:13.500 --> 32:15.125
We're outside time.

32:18.416 --> 32:19.541
How?

32:21.708 --> 32:24.041
I finally learned to control
the time slipping.

32:28.208 --> 32:29.625
I went back.

32:29.708 --> 32:31.833
I thought I could fix the Loom.

32:32.708 --> 32:34.333
It's a failsafe.

32:36.250 --> 32:40.583
It was designed to protect
the Sacred Timeline and nothing else.

32:40.666 --> 32:42.125
Of course it is.

32:42.958 --> 32:44.458
I'm out of options, Sylvie.

32:45.500 --> 32:46.916
I've tried everything.

32:48.625 --> 32:50.541
The only way that anything survives...

32:50.625 --> 32:54.208
Is if I never kill He Who Remains
in the first place.

32:57.250 --> 33:00.416
So you have to kill me.

33:19.416 --> 33:22.916
I'm not giving you my blessing,
if that's what you're waiting for.

33:25.541 --> 33:26.833
What do I do?

33:29.458 --> 33:33.291
It's the Sacred Timeline, or nothing.

33:33.375 --> 33:36.166
It's not enough
to protect the Sacred Timeline, Loki.

33:36.916 --> 33:40.291
Even down there,
it's full of death and destruction

33:40.375 --> 33:41.625
and injustice.

33:42.708 --> 33:45.750
Do you really wanna be the god
who takes away everyone's free will

33:45.833 --> 33:46.875
so you can protect that?

33:46.958 --> 33:50.750
But what good is free will
if everyone's dead?

33:50.833 --> 33:53.083

we can't die trying?

33:54.416 --> 33:56.875

we can't die fighting?

33:57.875 --> 34:00.958
You're replacing one nightmare
with another.

34:01.625 --> 34:03.625
I grew up in apocalypses, Loki.

34:04.333 --> 34:06.791
I've lived through enough of them to know

34:06.875 --> 34:09.333
that sometimes
it's okay to destroy something.

34:12.458 --> 34:13.458
If...

34:16.333 --> 34:21.083
If there's a hope
that you can replace that thing

34:24.000 --> 34:25.500
with something better.

36:06.916 --> 36:08.000
for you.

36:10.083 --> 36:11.291
For all of us.

36:13.708 --> 36:14.750
-No!

-Try to kill us all?
-Yeah.

I'll be up in a moment?

I'll do you one better,
I'll save you a seat.

43:24.500 --> 43:27.750
Hey, you. You okay?

43:27.875 --> 43:31.375
I got those reports
on the Variants of He Who Remains.

43:32.041 --> 43:34.500
-Do any of them know that we exist yet?
-Nope.

43:34.583 --> 43:38.750
I guess one of 'em caused a little bit
of a ruckus on 616 adjacent realm,

43:38.833 --> 43:41.208
but they handled it.
So, we're all good for now.

43:41.291 --> 43:42.875
That's all we can ask for.

43:43.416 --> 43:46.541

-Yeah, I'll meet you up there.

get these taken down.

the past are, you know...

So, when we get in there...

Yeah, funny you should
mention that because...
