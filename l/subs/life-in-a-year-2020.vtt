something about life,

1:39:12.729 --> 1:39:14.209
but they're wrong.

1:39:15.993 --> 1:39:19.692
The only way to learn
about life is by living.

1:39:19.692 --> 1:39:24.523
And I've learned that
every moment is your moment.

1:39:24.523 --> 1:39:27.787
Sometimes the moments
are messy,

1:39:27.787 --> 1:39:30.138
sometimes they're beautiful,

1:39:30.138 --> 1:39:33.924
or scary,
or just plain weird.

1:39:33.924 --> 1:39:36.144
But they're all yours.

1:39:36.144 --> 1:39:37.841
Cherish them.

1:39:37.841 --> 1:39:39.712
Living isn't easy.

1:39:39.712 --> 1:39:43.281
But if you can manage
to look past your own fears

1:39:43.281 --> 1:39:45.805
and everyone else's
expectations,

1:39:46.981 --> 1:39:50.593
the reward is your life.

1:39:50.593 --> 1:39:52.029
And in my life?

I had to play it
