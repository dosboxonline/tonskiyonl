04:41.657 --> 04:43.492
MURTAUGH'S FAMILY:
Surprise!

04:44.034 --> 04:46.704
Happy birthday, Daddy!

04:46.912 --> 04:49.373
SINGING:
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

04:49.582 --> 04:51.542
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

04:51.834 --> 04:55.880
<i>Happy birthday, dear Daddy
Happy birthday to you!</i>

04:56.172 --> 04:57.715
Make a wish!

04:58.007 --> 05:00.050
I wish...
I'm not going to tell you.

05:00.342 --> 05:02.219
TRISH:
Come on, blow them out!

05:07.308 --> 05:08.851
MURTAUGH:
Give me some sugar, girl.

05:09.351 --> 05:12.313
TRISH: One more candle and the
smoke alarm would've gone off.

05:16.692 --> 05:18.194
The big 5-0.

05:19.945 --> 05:23.574
You know, your beard's getting gray.
Kind of makes you look old.

05:23.741 --> 05:25.618
It's all right. I still love you.

05:27.036 --> 05:28.412
RIANNE:
Bye, Pa.

06:05.866 --> 06:07.618
(COUGHS)

07:08.345 --> 07:09.555
(BELCHES)

07:16.478 --> 07:18.856
GIRL 1: Good morning!
GIRL 2: Hi, Mrs. Murtaugh.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.067
GIRLS: Where's Rianne?
TRISH: She's upstairs.

07:23.527 --> 07:25.237
GIRL 2: Good morning.
MURTAUGH: Good morning.

07:25.446 --> 07:27.489
GIRL 2: That's my bacon!
MURTAUGH: It's mine now.

07:27.698 --> 07:29.867
Don't you close doors around here?

07:30.034 --> 07:31.744
Baby, what's this on my tie?

07:33.245 --> 07:34.872
That is an ugly spot.

07:35.080 --> 07:37.333
Thanks. Sharp as a tack.

07:37.583 --> 07:39.960
TRISH:
I'm thinking of going on <i>Jeopardy.</i>

07:40.586 --> 07:43.047
MURTAUGH: Just don't take any
questions about cooking.

07:47.468 --> 07:49.261
TRISH:
Don't step in the egg!

07:50.512 --> 07:53.974
What am I thinking? I should have
checked the floor for egg!

07:55.768 --> 07:59.063
TRISH: Do you know a man named
Michael Hunsaker?

07:59.355 --> 08:01.482
Michael Hunsaker?

08:02.358 --> 08:04.276
Jesus! Michael Hunsaker!

08:04.693 --> 08:06.570
- What did he want?
- Your office called.

08:06.904 --> 08:09.073
He's tried to reach you for three days.

08:09.281 --> 08:11.116
I haven't talked to him in...

08:12.910 --> 08:14.244
...twelve years!

08:15.079 --> 08:16.413
Wait a minute.

08:16.622 --> 08:18.624
That would make me...

08:19.625 --> 08:21.001
...fifty!

08:21.627 --> 08:23.128
That means that you're...

08:24.213 --> 08:25.756
We're not gonna discuss it.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.633
Forget the eggs.

08:29.718 --> 08:31.095
TRISH: Roger?
MURTAUGH: Yeah, baby?

08:31.303 --> 08:33.639
How come I never heard
of Michael Hunsaker?

08:33.931 --> 08:35.599
MURTAUGH:
Just never talked about him.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.308
Vietnam buddy?

08:37.643 --> 08:39.645
Eat your own cake. Vietnam buddy.

08:39.895 --> 08:41.270
CARRIE: Daddy?
MURTAUGH: Yeah, baby?

08:41.563 --> 08:43.315
Nick and the kids
left without me.

08:43.607 --> 08:47.027
He left without you? Come on,
I never get enough of my baby.

08:47.277 --> 08:50.948
RIANNE: This is my New Year's Eve dress.
Do you like it? Isn't it cool?

08:51.156 --> 08:52.574
CARRIE:
It's beautiful.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.286
RIANNE:
Have a good birthday.

09:04.837 --> 09:06.547
Goddamn heartbreaker!

09:19.685 --> 09:21.687
OFFICER 1:
Happy birthday, Rog!

09:23.564 --> 09:25.649
INVESTIGATOR:
Hey, happy birthday, Rog.

09:26.817 --> 09:29.862
- Lay off me.
- You got a spot on your tie.

09:30.154 --> 09:31.155
What do we got here?

09:31.321 --> 09:32.698
We got a hooker.

09:32.990 --> 09:36.577
No, it's Dixie. Would you please
tell these bozos to lay off?

09:36.994 --> 09:38.120
You bozos, lay off.

09:38.328 --> 09:41.081
Had a jumper here last night.
She saw it happen.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.208
Get her statement, send her home.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.170
Thanks. I'm beat.
You know how it is.

09:46.879 --> 09:48.630
MURTAUGH:
All dressed up, no one to blow.

09:49.590 --> 09:52.384
You're hilarious!
I can't believe you damn cops!

09:52.676 --> 09:55.345
The jumper's name is Amanda Hunsaker.

09:56.138 --> 09:57.723
Age 22.

09:58.015 --> 10:02.019
Prostitute. One arrest,
no convictions. Born in Tennessee.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.896
- Parents...
- What was the name?

10:05.230 --> 10:06.815
The parents.

10:07.858 --> 10:09.401
Michael and Claire.

10:10.652 --> 10:11.904
You know them?

10:12.905 --> 10:15.991
Right. Find out who bought it,
who's paying the bills.

10:16.200 --> 10:18.827
- That will take some looking into.
- So look!

10:20.245 --> 10:21.330
Yeah.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.231
Hello, honey.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.943
Give me the number
for Michael Hunsaker.

10:51.235 --> 10:53.904
TRISH: <i>The man we talked about?
Your Vietnam buddy?</i>

10:54.154 --> 10:57.282
- You just mentioned him this morning.
<i>- What's wrong?</i>

10:57.533 --> 10:59.785
His daughter just dove out a window.

11:04.706 --> 11:05.916
I got it.

11:23.225 --> 11:24.226
Hey.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.271
DEALER 1:
Good, huh? Tasty? Smooth?

11:30.315 --> 11:33.193
RIGGS: Yeah, that's good.
DEALER 2: You better fucking believe it.

11:33.819 --> 11:35.487
Let's do it. How much?

11:35.779 --> 11:37.447
How much for how much?

11:38.240 --> 11:39.408
For all of it.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.744
- You want it all? He wants it all.
DEALER 3: He wants it all. Beautiful!

11:42.953 --> 11:45.831
DEALER 1: All right!
RIGGS: And nice tree to put it under.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.125
- You want a tree?
- Yeah!

11:48.333 --> 11:49.835
I'll tell you what.

11:50.210 --> 11:53.005
I'll give you the best tree
on the lot for nothing.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.716
But the shit's gonna cost you...

11:56.508 --> 11:57.718
...a hundred.

11:57.885 --> 11:58.886
That much?

11:59.136 --> 12:00.929
That's a fair price.

12:02.014 --> 12:03.098
Yeah. Hell...

12:03.307 --> 12:04.516
...you only live once.

12:05.434 --> 12:06.727
RIGGS:
Get this together here.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.813
20, 40...

12:10.105 --> 12:11.273
...60, 70...

12:11.481 --> 12:14.651
- What the fuck?
- Hey, man!

12:14.818 --> 12:15.819
Hey!

12:15.986 --> 12:17.321
Shut up, I'm losing count.

12:17.779 --> 12:20.240
93, 94, 95, 96...

12:20.741 --> 12:21.992
DEALER 2:
Forget it, dumbshit!

12:22.659 --> 12:24.328
One hundred thousand!

12:24.745 --> 12:27.039
One hundred thousand dollars!

12:28.540 --> 12:30.042
A hundred thousand?

12:30.375 --> 12:34.796
I can't afford that. Not on my salary.
But look, I got a better idea.

12:35.255 --> 12:39.551
Let me say I take the whole stash
off your hands for free...

12:40.802 --> 12:43.764
...and you assholes go to jail.
What do you say?

12:45.557 --> 12:49.770
I could read you your rights, but you
already know what your rights are.

12:53.523 --> 12:55.025
This badge ain't real.

12:55.484 --> 12:56.526
You ain't real.

12:56.818 --> 12:59.196
You sure are a crazy son of a bitch.

13:01.657 --> 13:02.658
I'm crazy?

13:03.700 --> 13:05.786
You think I am crazy?

13:05.994 --> 13:07.579
I'll show you...

13:11.291 --> 13:14.169
That's a real badge, I'm a real cop
and this is a real gun.

13:15.545 --> 13:16.546
Okay, pal.

13:16.880 --> 13:18.507
Noses in the dirt, assholes!

13:30.852 --> 13:32.104
Where's your buddy?

13:32.396 --> 13:34.189
(SIREN)

13:36.191 --> 13:37.192
COP 1:
What do you got?

13:37.442 --> 13:40.737
Three down and one loose.
He's got a red shirt.

13:41.029 --> 13:42.406
COP 1:
Okay, let's go.

13:44.449 --> 13:47.327
Freeze! Give me the gun! Up, up!

13:48.328 --> 13:49.955
How's it feel, sucker?

13:50.539 --> 13:51.540
Shoot him!

13:51.748 --> 13:52.749
COP 1:
Drop it!

13:53.041 --> 13:54.626
Shoot him! Shoot him!

13:55.043 --> 13:57.421
DEALER 1: Shut the fuck up!
RIGGS: Shoot this prick!

13:58.630 --> 14:01.133
Shoot him! Somebody
shoot this prick!

14:01.466 --> 14:02.843
Shoot me.

14:03.135 --> 14:05.429
Shut up! Put them down!

14:05.762 --> 14:08.849
- I warn you! I'm going to shoot you!
- Shoot him!

14:09.099 --> 14:10.892
Shut the fuck up! Shut up!

14:11.101 --> 14:13.270
Shoot me! Shoot him!

14:20.777 --> 14:22.154
COP 1:
Get him out of there.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.157
It ain't worth it.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.417
KID:
Hey, wait up already!

17:03.899 --> 17:05.567
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

17:33.803 --> 17:35.639
I miss you...

17:38.308 --> 17:39.976
...Victoria Lynn.

17:53.949 --> 17:55.951
That's silly, isn't it?

18:01.706 --> 18:03.500
I'll see you later.

18:05.335 --> 18:07.295
I'll see you much later.

18:13.510 --> 18:16.096
Once more with feeling on three.

18:17.097 --> 18:21.101
Damn it, Cooley. Do it on three,
or go on the street.

18:25.689 --> 18:28.358
<i>Silent night</i>

18:29.401 --> 18:32.028
Are you telling me
Riggs is playing a game?

18:32.362 --> 18:35.699
Sure. He wants the cash.
But he'll come around.

18:36.032 --> 18:38.285
That's a very dangerous
attitude to take.

18:38.535 --> 18:43.206
Remember, his wife of 11 years
was just killed in a car accident.

18:43.581 --> 18:47.377
- He pulls his gun when he shouldn't.
- I know all about him.

18:47.627 --> 18:48.837
He's a tough bastard.

18:49.045 --> 18:52.299
He's on the edge. I'm telling you,
he may be psychotic.

18:52.507 --> 18:54.467
That's a bunch of psych bullshit.

18:54.676 --> 18:57.554
You're making a mistake
by keeping him in the field.

18:57.887 --> 18:59.556
The man is suicidal.

18:59.806 --> 19:02.600
You're sure of that diagnosis?
You have no doubts?

19:02.892 --> 19:04.561
There are no absolutes in life.

19:04.811 --> 19:07.397
End of discussion.
We're going to wait.

19:07.731 --> 19:10.358
If he offs himself,
then we'll know I was wrong.

19:10.567 --> 19:13.903
PSYCHOLOGIST: You're making
a mistake, because if you're wrong...

19:21.077 --> 19:22.746
Asshole!

19:23.288 --> 19:25.915
Roger, you're
way behind the times.

19:26.166 --> 19:30.086
The guys in the 80s aren't tough.
They're sensitive people.

19:30.462 --> 19:33.465
They show emotions around women,
shit like that.

19:35.216 --> 19:36.760
I think I'm an 80s man.

19:37.010 --> 19:38.511
MURTAUGH:
How do you figure?

19:38.762 --> 19:40.180
Last night...

19:40.597 --> 19:42.599
...I cried in bed. How's that?

19:45.643 --> 19:47.312
MURTAUGH:
Were you with a woman?

19:47.771 --> 19:51.232
I was alone. Why do you think
I was crying? Merry Christmas.

19:51.483 --> 19:53.610
MURTAUGH:
Sounds like an 80s man to me.

19:54.444 --> 19:56.780
- News on the Hunsaker case.
- That was quick.

19:57.030 --> 20:00.450
So was the autopsy.
They're not calling it a suicide.

20:01.076 --> 20:04.996
DETECTIVE: Surprise. The coroner
found evidence she used barbiturates.

20:05.705 --> 20:07.207
Brilliant detective work.

20:07.415 --> 20:09.125
There were pills all over.

20:09.417 --> 20:11.753
DETECTIVE:
Right. That's not the surprise.

20:12.087 --> 20:14.547
The surprise is the pills were doctored.

20:15.131 --> 20:17.634
DETECTIVE: The capsules were loaded
with drain cleaner.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.052
She'd have died anyway.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.261
This case stinks.

20:20.512 --> 20:24.265
You know,
you looked younger with the beard.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.267
Thanks, captain.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.187
You shaved the beard.

20:29.646 --> 20:30.897
Some detective.

20:31.439 --> 20:32.732
Two more things.

20:33.650 --> 20:36.111
DETECTIVE: The condition
of the sheets indicates...

20:36.444 --> 20:39.447
...someone else was
in bed with Amanda. That's "A."

20:39.656 --> 20:40.657
What's "B"?

20:40.949 --> 20:44.160
"B" is, you're breaking in
a new partner on this.

20:44.494 --> 20:45.495
Partner again?

20:45.787 --> 20:49.207
DETECTIVE: Some cat on loan from Dope.
Real burnout, on the edge.

20:49.541 --> 20:50.625
Perfect.

20:53.211 --> 20:54.337
Gun!

21:01.136 --> 21:02.846
DETECTIVE:
Rog, meet your new partner.

21:06.641 --> 21:09.310
I'm too old for this shit.

21:13.565 --> 21:16.025
MURTAUGH: There are those who
say you're a good cop.

21:16.317 --> 21:17.694
RIGGS:
I try.

21:18.361 --> 21:22.365
MURTAUGH: I heard about the little
stunt yesterday. Pretty heroic.

21:24.659 --> 21:26.327
I pulled your file.

21:26.661 --> 21:30.373
Said you worked in the Phoenix
project in Vietnam. That right?

21:30.582 --> 21:33.543
Assassination stuff.
It's over, you know.

21:34.043 --> 21:35.378
RIGGS:
What is?

21:36.045 --> 21:37.046
MURTAUGH:
The war.

21:37.338 --> 21:38.882
RIGGS:
Yes, I know.

21:39.215 --> 21:40.884
MURTAUGH:
Just thought I'd remind you.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.388
That's some serious shit you carry.

21:46.848 --> 21:48.516
RIGGS:
Be my guest.

21:53.354 --> 21:57.066
MURTAUGH: 9mm Beretta. Takes 15
in the mag, one up the pipe...

21:57.400 --> 22:01.029
...wide ejection port, no feed jams.

22:01.404 --> 22:02.489
What have you got?

22:02.739 --> 22:03.865
Four-inch Smith.

22:05.408 --> 22:06.493
Six-shooter?

22:08.077 --> 22:09.662
A lot of old-timers carry those.

22:14.042 --> 22:16.669
MURTAUGH: File also said you're heavy
into martial arts.

22:16.920 --> 22:20.256
Tai chi and all that killer stuff.

22:20.590 --> 22:23.927
I suppose we have to register you
as a lethal weapon.

22:24.761 --> 22:28.598
Let's just cut the shit.
We both know why I was transferred.

22:28.848 --> 22:33.186
Everybody thinks I'm suicidal,
so nobody wants to work with me.

22:33.436 --> 22:35.897
Some think I'm faking
to draw psycho pension...

22:36.105 --> 22:40.109
...so nobody wants to work with me.
Basically, I'm fucked.

22:40.276 --> 22:41.361
Guess what?

22:41.778 --> 22:44.364
- I don't want to work with you.
- Then don't.

Get her out of what?

26:56.866 --> 27:01.537
Get her out of the stuff she was into.

get her out. Help her.

Just find them and kill them.

28:48.853 --> 28:51.856

37:37.464 --> 37:41.301
Maybe we'll stay alive long enough
for me to buy you a present.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.305
Don't thank me now.

37:45.639 --> 37:49.643
It's the least I can do after
all the kindness you've shown me.

38:02.197 --> 38:04.867
Are you gonna tell me
where we're going?

38:05.701 --> 38:07.035
Are we together on this?

38:08.203 --> 38:12.541
Beverly Hills. We got an address
on Amanda Hunsaker's meal ticket.

38:12.833 --> 38:15.210
Remember, he's not a suspect yet.

38:15.544 --> 38:18.005
So we question him, not damage him.

38:18.213 --> 38:20.716
I won't hurt. You do all the talking.

38:21.008 --> 38:22.426
Let me do all the talking.

38:22.676 --> 38:24.636
Experience counts here.

38:27.347 --> 38:30.350
MURTAUGH: You're not gonna smoke here.
RIGGS: Well, I am.

38:31.935 --> 38:33.687
RIGGS:
What? Does this bother you?

38:33.896 --> 38:34.938
MURTAUGH:
It bothers me.

38:35.189 --> 38:36.732
RIGGS: Does it?
MURTAUGH: Yeah.

38:38.484 --> 38:40.027
RIGGS:
I'll open a window.

38:40.402 --> 38:45.324
MURTAUGH: That's not the point.
I have to take care of myself.

38:46.283 --> 38:48.535
MURTAUGH:
4241 coming up.

38:48.744 --> 38:50.162
RIGGS:
Bingo.

38:51.330 --> 38:55.375
RIGGS: Do we have a warrant?
MURTAUGH: We don't need one.

38:55.834 --> 38:57.878
MURTAUGH:
Didn't take them long, huh?

39:01.924 --> 39:04.760
GIRL: Hey, guys, go on in!
Make yourselves at home!

39:05.093 --> 39:06.386
Merry Christmas!

39:06.637 --> 39:08.639
RIGGS: Merry Christmas!
MURTAUGH: Merry Christmas!

39:08.889 --> 39:11.266
MURTAUGH:
Don't need a warrant with an invitation.

39:12.976 --> 39:16.438
RIGGS: I saw this place on
"Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless."

39:26.323 --> 39:27.783
MURTAUGH:
Get the door.

39:39.670 --> 39:42.798
MURTAUGH: Nice and easy.
RIGGS: Nice and easy.

39:44.508 --> 39:47.803
MURTAUGH: Looks like the Garden of Eden.
RIGGS: Look at this!

39:49.137 --> 39:50.597
MURTAUGH:
Paradise.

39:53.850 --> 39:55.561
RIGGS:
Isn't that sweet?

39:55.811 --> 39:58.146
I'm thinking probable cause.

40:13.579 --> 40:15.038
MURTAUGH:
Okay, asshole!

40:15.622 --> 40:17.374
Move! Come on! Get out!

40:17.624 --> 40:19.418
Fast! Move!

40:20.711 --> 40:23.463
Get your hands on that tree
and face each other!

RIGGS: Don't move. I'll break your arm.

40:29.886 --> 40:30.929
RIGGS:
Got them!

40:34.016 --> 40:35.559
Show me your hands!

40:35.934 --> 40:37.394
Right now!

40:38.020 --> 40:39.855
Put your hands out there!

40:44.776 --> 40:46.069
MURTAUGH:
See how easy that was?

40:46.361 --> 40:49.865
Boom! Still alive.
Now we question him. You know why?

40:50.157 --> 40:53.452
Because I didn't shoot him
or jump off a building with him.

40:53.660 --> 40:55.120
The building guy lived.

40:55.370 --> 40:56.997
The point being, no killing.

40:57.372 --> 40:59.416
- No killing, right.
- Right.

40:59.625 --> 41:01.668
Piece of cake. Now I'm happy.

41:01.918 --> 41:04.588
Read him his rights.
I'll stand here being happy.

41:07.132 --> 41:08.216
RIGGS:
He's got a gun!

41:49.424 --> 41:50.425
Oops.

41:52.010 --> 41:54.638
You ever met anybody you didn't kill?

41:57.808 --> 42:00.143
Well, I haven't killed you yet.

42:02.521 --> 42:04.147
Don't do me no favors.

42:04.523 --> 42:06.066
Don't you worry.

42:18.036 --> 42:21.748
MURTAUGH: The coroner gave the body
a ride downtown.

42:23.834 --> 42:25.836
I guess we can get out of here.

42:30.882 --> 42:33.343
I'm sorry about that shit
I said out there.

42:35.345 --> 42:38.014
You saved my life. Thank you.

42:44.354 --> 42:45.814
I bet that hurt to say.

42:48.358 --> 42:49.609
You'll never know.

42:51.695 --> 42:53.155
MURTAUGH:
Let's get a bite to eat.

Is that a crook?

No, this is my new partner, Martin.

- Carrie?

I'm glad you're home at a sensible hour.

Well, I try to be a sensible dad.

Come on in, Martin.

43:49.252 --> 43:51.254
Yeah, close the door.

Hello, Nick. Get your legs
off the arm of the couch.

43:57.552 --> 44:01.473
How you doing? Is Mommy
in the kitchen? Let's sneak up on her.

MURTAUGH: Hello, baby!
I want you to meet...

RIGGS: Martin Riggs.
TRISH: How are you?

44:14.820 --> 44:17.781
- This is my wife, Trish.
- Pleased to meet you.

44:18.073 --> 44:20.200
Martin's going to join us for dinner.

44:20.450 --> 44:23.119
- Roast okay with you?
- What's for dinner?

44:23.787 --> 44:26.122
MURTAUGH:
We'll see what's for dinner.

44:26.957 --> 44:29.793
This is a brown, sticky...

44:30.293 --> 44:31.670
It's roast.

44:31.962 --> 44:34.381
How about a brown, roast-like substance?

44:34.589 --> 44:37.467
- Roger, you're being an asshole.
- I try not to be.

44:37.801 --> 44:39.594
MURTAUGH: Want a drink?
- What do you got?

44:39.761 --> 44:41.847
MURTAUGH:
We have Canadian Mist...

44:42.681 --> 44:46.268
MURTAUGH: You like Canadian Mist?
TRISH: Honey, it's in the back.

44:48.478 --> 44:51.815
MURTAUGH: How come we didn't have fish?
I thought we had fish tonight.

44:52.148 --> 44:53.733
TRISH:
Don't worry about the fish.

44:53.984 --> 44:55.986
Getting defensive...
Ever go fishing?

44:56.278 --> 44:59.239
Not since I was a kid.
I used to go spear fishing.

45:01.157 --> 45:02.534
RIGGS:
All I caught was a cold.

45:04.995 --> 45:06.621

I got that boat out there.

45:06.955 --> 45:08.957

Rianne! Your mother said
get the dessert.

NICK: Get the dessert. Get to it!
- Shut up.

45:16.172 --> 45:20.677
MURTAUGH: Catalina Island. Nothing
exciting, but I catch my allotment.

45:21.052 --> 45:25.432
You can catch a few things out there.
I caught my wife out there.

45:26.975 --> 45:28.643
MURTAUGH:
Nice fishing out there.

45:28.894 --> 45:30.353

RIGGS: It's nice. You know
anything about boats?

It's not a sailboat.

There's no trick. That's the front,
that's the back, water all around.

Why you gotta make things
so complicated?

Here.

47:06.950 --> 47:07.951
Thanks.

47:08.118 --> 47:11.913
I don't. Things get complicated
all by themselves.

47:12.330 --> 47:14.582
You mean Amanda Hunsaker's murder, huh?

47:14.874 --> 47:16.835
Did I mention that? I didn't.

Didn't have to.
I can read your mind.

- Why is there a problem?
- There's no problem.

47:27.095 --> 47:29.305
You got one dead girl
and one dead guy.

47:29.556 --> 47:33.977
The guy kills the girl. We kill him
because he wants us to be dead guys.

- The blond one.
- With pits in his face?

Those are dimples.

through his head. The answer is no.

and I can't smoke a joint?

48:48.009 --> 48:49.344
It's not coke, you know.

I'll tell you why.
Because now, at this moment...

Right or wrong?

48:57.352 --> 48:59.354

takes out the garbage...

49:20.708 --> 49:23.378
...your daughter smokes grass
and it's illegal...

49:24.754 --> 49:27.590
...and you don't know

tomorrow without killing anybody...

in Laos from 1000 yards out.

50:25.106 --> 50:26.608
Maybe eight...

50:27.150 --> 50:30.320
...or even ten guys in the world
could have made that shot.

Morning, Roger.
Here, have some coffee.

about the night Amanda Hunsaker died.

- Trish let me in.

- What time is it?
- Daytime.

53:49.977 --> 53:52.647
The night Amanda Hunsaker died, she...

53:53.147 --> 53:56.150
What was the name of that hooker
who witnessed the jump?

53:56.359 --> 53:59.862
Come on, we got to get up
and catch bad guys today.

54:00.154 --> 54:01.656

MURTAUGH: Her name is Dixie!

And get out of here!

54:13.167 --> 54:14.252
(GUNSHOTS)

54:16.671 --> 54:19.715
Someone was in bed with Amanda
the night she died.

RIGGS:
Until now, we assumed it was a man.

54:22.510 --> 54:24.178
Suppose it was Dixie.

54:24.429 --> 54:28.683
Disgusting, but okay. Let's say Dixie
put the drain cleaner in her pills.

54:28.850 --> 54:30.351
MURTAUGH:
Say someone paid her.

54:30.560 --> 54:35.440
She thinks, "Amanda swallows a couple
downers and she's dead." Then Dixie...

54:35.857 --> 54:37.024
If it was her.

54:37.191 --> 54:42.280
If it was her. She's got plenty of time
to spritz the place up and get out.

54:42.488 --> 54:44.532
But Amanda jumps out the window.

54:44.866 --> 54:46.742
Or Dixie pushes her.

54:46.951 --> 54:49.912
She has to make a quick exit
because the body's public.

54:50.121 --> 54:51.706
So she hauls ass downstairs.

54:51.873 --> 54:53.875
People are saying, "What happened?"

54:54.125 --> 54:56.502
Somebody spots her,
and she says, "Shit!"

54:56.878 --> 54:59.005
That's right, she says, "Shit!"

54:59.255 --> 55:02.258
The point being that now
she has to cover her ass.

55:04.218 --> 55:08.890
So she grabs a flatfoot and says,
"Officer, I saw the whole thing."

55:10.224 --> 55:11.559
Right.

55:12.727 --> 55:13.853
Right.

55:15.396 --> 55:17.023
That's pretty fucking thin.

55:17.231 --> 55:18.483
That's very thin.

55:18.816 --> 55:20.485
Thin's my middle name.

55:20.735 --> 55:23.154
Your wife's cooking, I'm not surprised.

55:24.572 --> 55:26.157
MURTAUGH: What?
RIGGS: Nothing.

55:26.491 --> 55:29.243
Those remarks won't get you
invited to Christmas dinner.

55:30.328 --> 55:33.039
My luck's changing
for the better every day.

55:35.249 --> 55:37.752
MURTAUGH:
All right, baby, come to Roger.

55:40.087 --> 55:41.589
Center mass.

55:47.762 --> 55:49.639
Read them and weep.

55:52.934 --> 55:55.144
Do you sleep with that thing?

55:55.645 --> 55:57.188
I would if I slept.

55:57.522 --> 56:00.691
Step back. Let me show
what an old man can do.

56:01.609 --> 56:03.819
Just warming up,
just warming up.

56:04.570 --> 56:06.614
(MURTAUGH WHISTLES)

56:11.452 --> 56:13.037
Watch carefully.

56:26.634 --> 56:30.137
Hey! Look at that, will you?
Not bad for an old man.

56:30.638 --> 56:32.807
Step aside, old man.

56:33.057 --> 56:34.934
(RIGGS SINGS)

57:28.988 --> 57:30.781
Have a nice day.

57:36.495 --> 57:37.913
Shit!

57:41.626 --> 57:44.295
Uh-oh! The policemen are here!

57:45.004 --> 57:48.299
KID 1: Yeah, you're right.
Hello, policemen!

57:50.134 --> 57:51.218
RIGGS:
Hi.

57:51.886 --> 57:52.887
MURTAUGH:
Hi.

57:53.512 --> 57:55.389
MURTAUGH: How you doing?
KIDS: Fine.

57:55.598 --> 57:58.267
Are you going to bust Dixie?

57:58.559 --> 58:01.312
We're just going over there
for a cup of coffee.

58:01.562 --> 58:03.731
MURTAUGH:
We're going over here to have breakfast.

58:03.939 --> 58:06.233
KIDS:
You're gonna bust Dixie!

58:06.400 --> 58:08.903
You're gonna bust Dixie!

58:09.153 --> 58:11.447
You're gonna bust Dixie!

58:11.822 --> 58:14.075
You're gonna bust Dixie!

58:14.283 --> 58:17.453
- Like I said, thin.
- Probably nothing.

58:30.424 --> 58:32.843
Did you see that? Wasn't that great?

58:36.555 --> 58:38.057
RIGGS:
What are you, a fag?

58:38.265 --> 58:39.934
MURTAUGH:
Your coat's on fire!

58:44.313 --> 58:47.650
RIGGS: Probably nothing.
MURTAUGH: Thin. Very thin.

58:49.860 --> 58:52.655
You guys okay? Got all
your fingers and toes?

58:52.947 --> 58:55.074
Three-William-56.

58:55.324 --> 58:58.285
We got a fire and explosion
at 111th and Larch.

58:58.577 --> 59:01.455
Request ambulance and fire department.

59:01.872 --> 59:04.208
KIDS:
Do it again! Do it again!

59:04.583 --> 59:07.461
RIGGS: Give me a break, guys.
MURTAUGH: Enough, enough!

59:07.712 --> 59:09.964
KID 2:
Do you think Dixie was home?

59:21.016 --> 59:22.393
What you got?

59:23.644 --> 59:24.979
Part of the device.

59:25.312 --> 59:27.732
This is artwork.
This is goddamn artwork.

59:27.982 --> 59:33.112
This is real pro stuff. I haven't seen
anything like this since the war.

59:34.530 --> 59:37.908
The CIA used to hire mercs.
They used the exact same setup.

59:38.159 --> 59:41.120
Mercury switches, gaflooey!
That's heavy shit.

59:41.328 --> 59:42.413
OFFICER:
Guys!

59:42.663 --> 59:45.666
We got something.
The detective wants to see you.

59:55.843 --> 59:56.886
DETECTIVE:
Okay, here it is.

59:57.178 --> 59:58.888
Some kids playing this morning...

59:59.138 --> 01:00:01.223
...one saw a guy checking the meter.

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:03.642
- Where?
- Here at Dixie's.

01:00:03.851 --> 01:00:08.189
He was playing under the porch.
Says he saw the guy pretty good.

01:00:08.439 --> 01:00:11.901
- It could be a break.
- Those kids are 6 years old.

01:00:12.151 --> 01:00:14.653
- You call the gas company?
- Sure did.

01:00:14.945 --> 01:00:18.574
No one's supposed to check
that meter for at least a month.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:23.037
MURTAUGH: Let me handle this.
DETECTIVE: Be my guest.

01:00:23.204 --> 01:00:25.706
He's the little fellow that saw the guy.

01:00:26.707 --> 01:00:29.710
My name is Detective Murtaugh.
What's yours?

01:00:29.877 --> 01:00:33.214
- Don't tell him your name.
- He'll put you in jail.

01:00:33.464 --> 01:00:34.715
You won't see your mom.

01:00:35.049 --> 01:00:38.886
It's all right. I won't
put you in jail. What's your name?

01:00:39.053 --> 01:00:42.223
- Don't tell him, Alfred.
MURTAUGH: Alfred!

01:00:42.681 --> 01:00:45.976
This is Alfred! Hey, meet Alfred.
This is Alfred.

01:00:46.227 --> 01:00:48.896
Alfred, hi! How old are you?

01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:50.397
Six.

01:00:50.773 --> 01:00:54.401
Six years old. I bet you like Go-Bots.

01:00:54.610 --> 01:00:56.070
Is that a real gun?

01:00:56.487 --> 01:00:58.447
Yeah, this is a real gun.

01:00:58.906 --> 01:01:00.074
Do you kill people?

01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:04.703
No. If some guy is hurting someone,
I try to shoot him in the leg...

01:01:04.912 --> 01:01:06.288
...just to stop him.

01:01:06.497 --> 01:01:09.083
Mama says policemen shoot black people.

01:01:09.291 --> 01:01:11.252
KID 2: Is it true?
KID 3: Yeah, is it true?

01:01:11.418 --> 01:01:13.254
Is that true?

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.092
Maybe we ought to get
the kids some...

01:01:18.509 --> 01:01:19.718
Ice cream.

01:01:20.135 --> 01:01:21.220
You like ice cream?

01:01:21.428 --> 01:01:24.014
Yeah! Ice cream!

01:01:27.726 --> 01:01:30.312
No, not you, Alfred.

01:01:31.730 --> 01:01:33.274
MURTAUGH:
Now, Alfred...

01:01:34.525 --> 01:01:37.862
The man you saw,
did you get a good look at him?

01:01:38.112 --> 01:01:40.447
- I saw him.
- Great!

01:01:41.115 --> 01:01:45.327
Picture him in your head.
Close your eyes.

01:01:45.953 --> 01:01:48.163
Think what he looks like.

01:01:48.497 --> 01:01:49.623
Got it?

01:01:50.124 --> 01:01:51.542
Can you draw him?

01:01:53.043 --> 01:01:56.046
Give me some drawing paper
and crayons.

01:01:56.505 --> 01:01:58.799
- This is good.
- Can it, man.

01:01:59.049 --> 01:02:01.385
We're gonna put out
an APB on Big Bird.

01:02:01.802 --> 01:02:04.555
"All units. Large
yellow bird, silly voice."

01:02:04.972 --> 01:02:07.808
You're hilarious, Martin. It's enough.

01:02:07.975 --> 01:02:09.768
Tell me what he looks like.

01:02:10.978 --> 01:02:12.021
Was he black?

01:02:13.272 --> 01:02:14.315
Was he white?

01:02:17.318 --> 01:02:18.777
Was he tall?

01:02:19.486 --> 01:02:21.030
Tall like me?

01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.324
What color was his hair? Brown?

01:02:24.575 --> 01:02:26.035
Black?

01:02:26.577 --> 01:02:28.037
Blond?

01:02:28.287 --> 01:02:29.788
His hair was blond.

01:02:30.873 --> 01:02:34.335
What did he have on?
Did he have jeans on?

01:02:34.501 --> 01:02:35.794
It was paint.

01:02:36.003 --> 01:02:37.296
Pained?

01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:38.923
I don't know.

01:02:39.840 --> 01:02:40.883
Pain...

01:02:41.467 --> 01:02:42.468
Painted?

01:02:43.719 --> 01:02:45.596
Painted. A tattoo?

01:02:47.222 --> 01:02:50.517
Like Popeye?
A tattoo like Popeye? No?

01:02:51.602 --> 01:02:52.811
It was that.

01:02:55.314 --> 01:02:56.732
Like that?

01:02:57.399 --> 01:02:58.901
Exactly like that?

01:03:00.569 --> 01:03:02.863
I saw it good. This is it.

01:03:03.072 --> 01:03:04.448
I remember.

01:03:04.907 --> 01:03:06.200
Are you sure?

01:03:06.742 --> 01:03:08.035
It had a knife, even.

01:03:19.588 --> 01:03:22.591
Roger, that's a Special Forces tattoo.

01:03:23.425 --> 01:03:25.260
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:03:26.345 --> 01:03:29.765
A Special Forces tattoo,
mercury switches...

01:03:33.769 --> 01:03:35.980
What the hell
have we gotten into here?

01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:38.357
Yeah. Here.

01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:42.611
RIGGS: Wonder if there's an opening
in the fire department?

01:03:52.871 --> 01:03:53.998
Want to tell me about it?

01:03:54.498 --> 01:03:56.917
HUNSAKER: About what?
MURTAUGH: Don't bullshit me.

01:03:57.126 --> 01:04:00.587
Your daughter wasn't killed
for something she was into.

01:04:00.796 --> 01:04:03.007
She was killed
for something you're into.

01:04:04.758 --> 01:04:05.968
Stop me if I'm wrong.

01:04:07.302 --> 01:04:09.388
I don't know what you mean.

01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:13.475
Keep your hands
away from your pocket, okay?

01:04:14.101 --> 01:04:15.978
- Easy, man.
- Fuck easy.

01:04:19.023 --> 01:04:22.443
You called me the other day
to blow the whistle, right?

01:04:23.152 --> 01:04:24.778
Blow the whistle on what?

01:04:24.945 --> 01:04:28.282
You were going to spill your guts,
so they killed your daughter.

01:04:28.490 --> 01:04:31.160
Tell me if I'm wrong.
Talk to me!

01:04:31.493 --> 01:04:33.662
They killed your daughter.

01:04:33.954 --> 01:04:37.041
They paid off a hooker to poison
your little girl.

01:04:37.291 --> 01:04:39.334
Chrissake!
I've got another daughter.

01:04:39.626 --> 01:04:42.921
- She'll be protected.
- You don't know these people.

01:04:43.422 --> 01:04:45.174
Acquaint me with them.

01:04:48.719 --> 01:04:50.471
It goes back to the war.

01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:57.936
I worked with a group called
Air America. CIA front.

01:05:00.189 --> 01:05:02.816
They secretly ran
the entire war out of Laos.

01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:07.696
I was with a special unit called
Shadow Company. Trained killers.

01:05:08.030 --> 01:05:11.533
When Charlie brought in heroin
to finance the VC government...

01:05:11.825 --> 01:05:14.578
...Shadow Company burned
the whole thing down.

01:05:15.037 --> 01:05:16.872
We killed everybody.

01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:23.670
We also formed a plan.

01:05:24.088 --> 01:05:25.214
Keep talking.

01:05:31.470 --> 01:05:34.848
A few years ago, Shadow Company
got together again.

01:05:35.224 --> 01:05:36.892
The war was over.

01:05:37.893 --> 01:05:41.480
- But we still had our sources in Asia.
- And?

01:05:42.064 --> 01:05:43.857
We've been bringing it in
ever since.

01:05:44.191 --> 01:05:45.526
Bringing in what?

01:05:46.568 --> 01:05:47.986
Heroin.

01:05:48.403 --> 01:05:50.697
Two major shipments a year.

01:05:54.076 --> 01:05:56.495
It's all run by ex-CIA.

01:05:57.246 --> 01:05:59.248
Soldiers, mercs.

01:06:00.082 --> 01:06:02.209
You son of a bitch!

01:06:02.376 --> 01:06:06.296
If you had cold feet, why did
they kill Amanda? Why not you?

01:06:06.547 --> 01:06:08.924
- They can't. They need me.
- Why?

01:06:09.216 --> 01:06:14.221
My company is a perfect front. Makes
everything look great on tax reports.

01:06:17.933 --> 01:06:20.269
This is big business, Roger.

01:06:25.107 --> 01:06:26.650
Not anymore.

01:06:27.776 --> 01:06:29.778
I'm gonna burn it down.

01:06:30.028 --> 01:06:31.822
You can't. It's too big.

01:06:32.406 --> 01:06:35.409
These people are trained,
expert killers.

01:06:35.909 --> 01:06:40.080
Tell me about your next shipment:
Where it's coming in, how many...

01:06:40.247 --> 01:06:42.958
I can't tell you that, Roger.
I can't.

01:06:43.625 --> 01:06:48.255
I have another daughter. You can't
protect her. I'm in this too deep.

01:07:07.566 --> 01:07:11.153
Heroin.
You got off easy, you son of a bitch!

01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:33.008
You through?

01:07:33.383 --> 01:07:35.177
I haven't even started.

01:07:35.677 --> 01:07:40.015
JOSHUA: <i>Gen. McAllister, this is
Delta One. We're coming in. Over.</i>

01:07:40.724 --> 01:07:42.643
GENERAL: Your mission is accomplished?
JOSHUA: <i>Yes, sir.</i>

01:07:43.393 --> 01:07:45.604
JOSHUA:
<i>Mr. Hunsaker is dead, sir.</i>

01:07:45.854 --> 01:07:48.732
<i>I'm afraid, however,
that another problem exists.</i>

01:07:48.982 --> 01:07:50.609
GENERAL:
<i>What is it? Explain.</i>

01:07:50.817 --> 01:07:52.819
JOSHUA:
<i>Hunsaker spoke to the police.</i>

01:07:53.153 --> 01:07:56.406
GENERAL: <i>Are they dead?</i>
JOSHUA: <i>No, I missed the opportunity.</i>

01:07:56.657 --> 01:08:00.535
GENERAL: <i>Very disappointing. So the
police may know the whole operation?</i>

01:08:00.744 --> 01:08:02.412
JOSHUA:
<i>That is correct, sir.</i>

01:08:03.038 --> 01:08:05.415
Joshua, it's time
we turned up the heat.

01:08:05.666 --> 01:08:07.125
Come on home.

01:08:23.767 --> 01:08:25.185
RIGGS: Hi.
PROSTITUTE: Hi.

01:08:25.394 --> 01:08:28.354
What's a nice Irish girl
like you doing out here?

01:08:28.522 --> 01:08:31.649
I'm looking for a guy,
had this girl in his stable.

01:08:31.858 --> 01:08:34.903

ass to jail...

You wore your vest.

Forest Lawn commercials.

It's rather large, this shipment.

01:24:35.863 --> 01:24:37.823
It would be unfortunate...

01:24:37.990 --> 01:24:40.743
...if we showed up
to deliver our heroin...

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:43.162

01:24:43.371 --> 01:24:44.622
That would be too bad.

all the cops know.
