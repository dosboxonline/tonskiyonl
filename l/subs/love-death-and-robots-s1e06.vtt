[narrator] <i>When the yogurt took over,</i>
<i>we all made the same jokes.</i>

00:42.922 --> 00:45.672
<i>"Finally our rulers would have culture.</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:48.338
<i>Our society is curdled.</i>

00:49.130 --> 00:54.088
<i>Our government is now</i>
<i>the cream of the crop," and so on.</i>

00:55.005 --> 00:58.130
<i>But, when we weren't laughing about</i>
<i>the absurdity of it all,</i>

00:58.213 --> 01:02.380
<i>we asked ourselves, "How did we ever get</i>
<i>to the point where we were,</i>

01:02.463 --> 01:05.755
<i>in fact, ruled by a dairy product?"</i>

01:06.963 --> 01:10.838
<i>Oh, as a matter of record,</i>
<i>we knew how it happened.</i>

01:12.255 --> 01:16.380
<i>Researchers took one of their most</i>
<i>computationally advanced strains of DNA</i>

01:16.463 --> 01:19.380
<i>and grafted it onto</i>
<i>Lactobacillus delbrueckii,</i>

01:19.463 --> 01:22.088
<i>commonly used to ferment yogurt.</i>

01:22.880 --> 01:26.172
<i>Initial tests appeared to be failures.</i>

01:26.630 --> 01:31.088
<i>However, one of the researchers sneaked</i>
<i>some of the bacillus out of the lab</i>

01:31.172 --> 01:33.838
<i>to use for her homemade yogurt.</i>

01:35.088 --> 01:40.088
<i>The night of June 27th,</i>
it <i>became sentient.</i>

01:42.880 --> 01:44.880
[yawning]

01:48.838 --> 01:50.005
[gasping]

02:00.963 --> 02:03.797
<i>The yogurt declared</i>
<i>it had arrived at solutions</i>

02:03.880 --> 02:05.672
<i>to many of the country's problems.</i>

02:07.005 --> 02:08.838
<i>But it wanted payment for that.</i>

02:10.130 --> 02:11.088
We.

02:11.797 --> 02:12.672
Want.

02:14.380 --> 02:15.380
Ohio.

02:22.213 --> 02:24.213
[everyone laughs]

02:26.588 --> 02:29.880
That's fine, we will just go to China.

02:30.297 --> 02:32.005
They promised us a whole province.

02:32.963 --> 02:34.963
[president chuckles slowly]

02:37.838 --> 02:40.380
[narrator] <i>The yogurt </i>
<i>was crafty and shrewd...</i>

02:40.505 --> 02:43.338
<i>and got a century-long lease on Ohio</i>

02:43.422 --> 02:47.547
<i>with the promise that it would respect</i>
<i>the human and constitutional rights</i>

02:47.630 --> 02:50.047
<i>of those who lived within its borders.</i>

02:50.130 --> 02:52.130
[electronic humming]

02:52.588 --> 02:55.880
<i>There it kept evolving, and soon,</i>

02:55.963 --> 02:58.297
<i>it handed over a complex formula</i>

02:58.380 --> 03:02.755
<i>to eradicate the national debt</i>
<i>within one year.</i>

03:04.338 --> 03:06.005
[yogurt] Follow it exactly.

03:06.088 --> 03:08.713
Any deviation will bring
complete economic ruin.

03:09.338 --> 03:10.547
We will.

03:10.838 --> 03:14.713
[narrator] <i>Naturally, the politicians</i>
<i>didn't follow instruction.</i>

03:14.797 --> 03:18.130
<i>Within six months,</i>
<i>the global economy collapsed.</i>

03:18.630 --> 03:20.505
I am going to eat your little toes.

-[narrator]<i> Only Ohio remained unscathed.</i>
<i>-</i>[baby laughs]

03:30.255 --> 03:32.755
[yogurt] We told you not to deviate
from the plan.

03:33.338 --> 03:36.172
Your experts are too close
to the problem to solve it.

03:36.672 --> 03:38.838
Any. Human. Is.

03:45.797 --> 03:48.297
[narrator] <i>The government declared </i>
<i>martial law,</i>

03:48.380 --> 03:51.213
<i>and gave the yogurt</i>
<i>supreme executive power.</i>

03:52.380 --> 03:56.255
<i>Of course, some people</i>
<i>weren't pleased at first.</i>

03:56.338 --> 03:59.005
[crowd yells] Down with yogurt, down--

03:59.088 --> 04:00.547
<i>The anti-government demonstrators--</i>

04:00.672 --> 04:02.672
[erratic electronic music plays]

04:10.422 --> 04:15.880
[narrator] <i>Now, ten years later,</i>
<i>humanity is happy, healthy, and wealthy.</i>

04:16.297 --> 04:20.463
<i>No one argues with the yogurt,</i>
<i>no one tweaks its formulas.</i>

04:20.755 --> 04:24.047
<i>That's how it happened,</i>
<i>but we still ask ourselves,</i>

04:24.130 --> 04:27.672
<i>if the yogurt was smart enough</i>
<i>to solve our debt problem,</i>

04:27.755 --> 04:32.005
<i>wasn't it also smart enough to realize</i>
<i>that human intellectual vanity</i>

04:32.088 --> 04:35.588
<i>would keep us from</i>
<i>following the formula exactly?</i>

04:36.755 --> 04:37.880
<i>Then there's this.</i>

04:37.963 --> 04:40.755
<i>-In the past several weeks, the yogurt...</i>
-[rocket engines blasting]

04:40.838 --> 04:43.630
<i>...has initiated several space launches.</i>

04:44.172 --> 04:46.547
<i>Life from earth is going to the stars,</i>

04:46.630 --> 04:50.005
<i>it just may not be human life.</i>

04:51.588 --> 04:55.172
<i>What happens if the yogurt</i>
<i>goes to the stars without us?</i>

04:55.630 --> 05:00.630
<i>What happens if it goes</i>
<i>and leaves us behind, forever?</i>
