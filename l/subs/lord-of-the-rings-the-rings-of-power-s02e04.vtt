WEBVTT

00:06.208 --> 00:08.583
I was sifting through Sadoc's old book.

00:08.666 --> 00:10.791
Harfoots must've journeyed this way
a long time ago.

00:12.083 --> 00:16.333
[Brânk] The Istar will surrender to me,
because if he doesn't,

00:16.375 --> 00:20.125
I will slaughter
the halflings he calls friends.

00:20.208 --> 00:21.375
[bell tolling]

00:22.291 --> 00:23.250
[Kilta grunts]

00:23.333 --> 00:25.583
[in Quenya] ...Túlielde Yallo!

00:28.666 --> 00:29.875
[Poppy and Nori screaming]

00:29.958 --> 00:31.541
[in English] Nori!

00:31.625 --> 00:33.041
[Estrid] Were you headed
for the ridgeline?

00:33.125 --> 00:35.416
The survivors will be waiting for us
where we made camp.

00:35.541 --> 00:37.666
-My father, too.
-I think you may have missed them.

00:37.791 --> 00:40.041
-[Isildur] You hoping to find kin as well?
-[Estrid] My betrothed.

00:40.125 --> 00:42.333
If he's even half as strong as you,
I'm certain of it.

00:42.416 --> 00:43.708
[Estrid] I'm not so strong as you think.

00:43.791 --> 00:44.791
[screams]

00:44.875 --> 00:47.750
[Theo] Anything you were to me,
is ashes now.

00:47.833 --> 00:51.000
So for my part,
we don't ever need to speak again.

00:51.083 --> 00:52.500
-[Berek whinnies]
-[Estrid grunts]

00:52.583 --> 00:53.916
-[grunts]
-[Berek whinnies]

00:54.000 --> 00:55.583
[Theo] D'you really want your horse back?

00:55.666 --> 00:58.208
-You know where he is?
-Meet me here. Tonight.

00:58.291 --> 01:00.625
[Hagen] What are you doin' out here
in the dark, boy?

01:01.458 --> 01:02.791
[Wildman grunts]

01:03.083 --> 01:04.250
It's an ambush!

01:05.000 --> 01:06.250
[Theo screams]

01:09.375 --> 01:12.375
[Glüg] Preparations are nearly complete,
Lord-father.

01:12.458 --> 01:14.375
Must we go to war again?

01:14.458 --> 01:16.583
We'll never truly be safe,

01:16.666 --> 01:19.541
until we've made certain
Sauron is no more.

01:19.625 --> 01:22.208
[Galadriel] Since the wearing
of this Ring, I have perceived

01:22.291 --> 01:24.208
glimpses of the unseen world...

01:24.291 --> 01:25.750
-[Celebrimbor grunts]
-[screams]

01:25.833 --> 01:28.875
[Galadriel] Our letters to Celebrimbor
have all gone unanswered.

01:28.958 --> 01:31.000
I fear Sauron may be in Eregion.

01:31.083 --> 01:33.708
The High King has consented
to send me and a small party there,

01:33.791 --> 01:36.083
to ensure Celebrimbor
and his city are safe.

01:36.875 --> 01:39.291
Elrond's task is not to join your company.

01:39.375 --> 01:40.500
But to lead it.

01:45.583 --> 01:47.458
[opening theme music playing]

03:17.708 --> 03:19.458
[birds chirping]

03:22.375 --> 03:23.625
[indistinct shouting]

03:27.333 --> 03:29.625
[Galadriel] Still no word
from Celebrimbor...

03:29.708 --> 03:33.791
If we take the Axa Bridge,
Eregion is just under 150 leagues.

03:34.416 --> 03:38.375
We shall need an archer, two swordsmen.
I trust you can recommend a set.

03:38.458 --> 03:40.625
Trust? Me?

03:40.708 --> 03:42.416
Are you certain that's wise, commander?

03:43.458 --> 03:46.875
At the High King's urging, I agreed
to appointment you as first lieutenant.

03:46.958 --> 03:49.791
But if you deem that duty beneath you,
I will choose another.

03:50.458 --> 03:52.333
-Yes.
-"Yes" what?

03:54.416 --> 03:58.416
Yes, I can recommend
an archer and two swordsmen.

03:59.833 --> 04:02.833
Who else shall we take with us, commander?

04:09.416 --> 04:11.250
[captivating music playing]

04:39.083 --> 04:41.375
[ominous music playing]

04:56.041 --> 04:57.375
Lightning?

05:01.666 --> 05:03.541
No earthly force could do this.

05:04.875 --> 05:07.083
This is the work of Sauron.

05:07.166 --> 05:10.166
Camnir. What other paths might we take?

05:13.708 --> 05:16.541
To circumvent it,
we shall either have to turn due north,

05:16.625 --> 05:18.083
adding two weeks to our journey...

05:18.833 --> 05:19.750
Or?

05:20.500 --> 05:24.000
We go south,
through the Hills of Tyrn Gorthad.

05:24.083 --> 05:25.250
-[Voice on the Wind whispering]
-[ringing]

05:25.333 --> 05:28.750
[Camnir, muffled] Which will get us
to Eregion much faster.

05:31.208 --> 05:32.791
[hisses]

05:39.916 --> 05:41.875
There is evil in those hills.

05:44.916 --> 05:48.125
Ancient, and filled with malice.

05:49.833 --> 05:53.750
Sauron means for us to go that way.
We must go another.

05:54.291 --> 05:56.791
The Enemy is doubtless
watching both roads.

06:00.791 --> 06:04.916
This collapse makes it more critical
than ever to reach Celebrimbor at speed.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.208
[Galadriel] We won't reach anywhere
at speed if we walk into a trap.

06:15.000 --> 06:16.083
We go south.

06:18.625 --> 06:19.875
Commander, I must protest.

06:19.958 --> 06:21.958
[Elrond] Your opinion on the matter
has been heard.

06:22.041 --> 06:23.208
Elrond.

06:26.708 --> 06:28.250
Opinion heard, lieutenant.

06:31.250 --> 06:32.791
We go south. [shouts in Sindarin]

06:45.250 --> 06:50.958
[in English] This company will not take
counsel from that trinket, nor will you.

06:53.041 --> 06:56.875
If you cannot abide by those terms,
you will leave now and return to Lindon.

06:58.083 --> 07:00.541
-I should like to.
-Then why do you not?

07:02.500 --> 07:05.208
Because I do not wish to see
any of this company slain.

07:06.500 --> 07:07.833
Including you.

07:11.750 --> 07:13.125
[Stranger yelling] Nori!

07:13.208 --> 07:14.958
[somber music playing]

07:20.416 --> 07:21.791
[goats bleating]

07:41.791 --> 07:44.000
Nori! Poppy!

08:05.708 --> 08:07.125
[goat farmer humming]

08:14.166 --> 08:15.083
[grunts]

08:15.708 --> 08:16.625
Uh...

08:18.916 --> 08:20.375
Um, uh...

08:20.458 --> 08:24.583
Pardon me. I don't suppose you've seen
a pair of halflings come this way?

08:24.666 --> 08:25.666
[goat farmer sighs]

08:32.416 --> 08:33.541
See you found the goat.

08:34.916 --> 08:36.291
[brays]

08:36.416 --> 08:40.708
It wasn't...
quite what I was searching for.

08:41.791 --> 08:43.791
Well, there's what you're searchin' for

08:43.875 --> 08:46.083
and there's what you find, now,
isn't there?

08:47.166 --> 08:51.416
[singing] Hey dol, merry dol
Ring a dong dillow...

08:51.500 --> 08:55.500
Sandflies in the grass
Bees around the willow

08:56.458 --> 08:59.458
There are some stars above your hill.

09:00.958 --> 09:02.500
Stars above most 'ills.

09:02.583 --> 09:05.208
But my friends and I
were looking for these stars.

09:05.291 --> 09:08.000
-I had hoped that...
-[whooshes]

09:08.083 --> 09:09.541
Oh... [grunts]

09:09.625 --> 09:11.666
My apologies, j-just a moment--

09:11.750 --> 09:14.875
[singing] Of sun, stars
Moon and mist

09:14.958 --> 09:16.833
[Stranger grunts]

09:16.916 --> 09:19.125
Rain and cloudy weather

09:24.458 --> 09:26.208
[Stranger grunting and groaning]

09:28.625 --> 09:29.500
[sighs]

09:39.875 --> 09:42.750
The branch... of course...

09:44.000 --> 09:44.833
Yes.

09:45.875 --> 09:46.958
It must be.

09:49.083 --> 09:50.500

-[Nori] D'you see him?
-Who? [grunts]

11:13.416 --> 11:17.666
Who d'you think?
Our friend, the bleedin' Stranger.

11:20.791 --> 11:23.250
Never mind where's he, where are we?

11:30.791 --> 11:32.375

[both grunting]

11:47.500 --> 11:49.541
[both panting and groaning]

11:53.625 --> 11:56.166
I think, I think we lost them.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.875
[Merimac] Where'd you lot come from?

12:00.750 --> 12:01.958
Us?

12:04.708 --> 12:05.791
Where'd you come from?

12:07.333 --> 12:09.666
Oh, my head.

12:10.125 --> 12:11.000
Uh...

12:12.083 --> 12:13.833
-Live here.
-Harfoots live here?

12:13.916 --> 12:15.250
What's an Harfoot?

12:15.333 --> 12:16.625
[chuckles] Well, you are--

12:18.500 --> 12:20.208
Who are you, exactly?

12:21.416 --> 12:22.708
I'm Nobody.

12:23.875 --> 12:25.791
Well, you can't be "Nobody."

12:25.875 --> 12:27.916
Well... That's what everybody calls me.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.791
If everybody calls you Nobody,
doesn't anybody call you somebody?

12:31.500 --> 12:33.708
Well, my mum calls me Merimac.

12:36.125 --> 12:37.333
I'm Poppy.

12:38.916 --> 12:39.916
Hmm.

12:47.041 --> 12:48.291
I'm Nori.

12:52.958 --> 12:54.375
Where'd you get that water from?

12:54.458 --> 12:56.500
-Keep your voice down.
-[Poppy] You stole it, didn't you?

12:56.583 --> 12:58.041
You stole it from that well.
From the big folk.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.166
[gasps]

12:59.250 --> 13:00.958
[grunting]

13:01.041 --> 13:02.625
-But-- Where are you going?
-[Merimac] Uh, nowhere.

13:02.708 --> 13:03.541
Take us with ya.

13:03.625 --> 13:06.000
Uh, sorry, no outsiders in the village.

13:06.083 --> 13:07.666
Village? What village?

13:07.750 --> 13:09.750
No village! There's no village.

13:09.833 --> 13:11.375
Listen here, Nobody.

13:13.000 --> 13:14.291
-[exclaims]
-Either we're coming with you

13:14.375 --> 13:17.541
or I will turn you in myself
this moment, water-thief.

13:23.916 --> 13:26.791
[Merimac] You're about to meet The Gund,
our dwell-leader.

13:26.875 --> 13:30.833
And if you want her to even think
about takin' you in, there's four rules.

13:30.916 --> 13:33.541
One, never look her in the eye.

13:33.625 --> 13:36.375
B, always stand three steps back.

13:36.458 --> 13:41.250
Four, don't, ever, ever, no matter what,
call her "The Gund."

13:42.750 --> 13:43.958
-Got it.
-Got it.

13:48.333 --> 13:50.125
Was that three rules or four?

13:50.208 --> 13:51.708
[Poppy] I wasn't really paying attention.

13:57.958 --> 14:00.083
[indistinct chatter]

14:00.166 --> 14:02.166
[upbeat music playing]

14:06.416 --> 14:08.375
[female Stoor villager 1]
Off you go, have fun now.

14:14.416 --> 14:15.916
[female Stoor villager 2]
Come on. Over there.

14:20.666 --> 14:22.500
[female Stoor villager 2]
That's 'cause it's had the sunshine on it.

14:26.875 --> 14:28.791
[female Stoor villager 3] You're there.

14:28.875 --> 14:30.833
[female Stoor villager 4] Nice,
fresh batch, ready to peel.

14:42.416 --> 14:44.708
-Big hat, like mine!
-[child] Like Dad's!

14:48.708 --> 14:51.291
Harfoots, livin' in holes?

14:54.375 --> 14:55.625
It doesn't seem natural.

14:55.708 --> 14:57.041
[Gundabale]
That's 'cause we're not Harfoots.

14:58.125 --> 14:59.333
We're Stoors.

15:00.375 --> 15:02.166
Stoors?

15:02.250 --> 15:04.291
[Gundabale] What were you thinkin',
bringin' 'em here?

15:04.375 --> 15:06.291
-Nobody's that stupid.
-[scoffs]

15:06.375 --> 15:07.708
They needed a place to hide.

15:07.791 --> 15:10.833
What, with half the devils
in the desert searchin' for them?

15:10.916 --> 15:14.250
Boy, if we put your brains in a vulture,
it'd fly backwards.

15:14.333 --> 15:15.666
Be nicer to him.

15:18.125 --> 15:19.958
Are you talkin' back-sass to me?

15:20.041 --> 15:22.625
Oh, that was the fourth rule.

15:23.333 --> 15:26.250
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't
feed you leg, limb, and joint

15:26.333 --> 15:28.291
to those Gaudrim hunting you out there.

15:31.916 --> 15:33.708
Go on, plead your case.

15:37.916 --> 15:42.083
I have walked across rivers,
and mountains,

15:42.166 --> 15:45.416
and deserts to help my friend
find his destiny,

15:45.500 --> 15:48.541
one the fate of the world may well
depend on, yours included--

15:48.625 --> 15:49.833
I said one good reason.

15:51.000 --> 15:53.375
This friend of yours, who is he, anyways?

15:53.916 --> 15:55.416
-He's a giant.
-A giant?

15:55.500 --> 15:57.791
-What, like an Elf?
-Bigger than that.

15:57.875 --> 15:59.250
So he's a great big Grand-Elf.

16:00.208 --> 16:01.208
He's not an Elf.

16:03.916 --> 16:05.125
He's a wizard.

16:05.208 --> 16:06.333
[villagers exclaiming]

16:06.416 --> 16:08.125
[murmuring]

16:08.875 --> 16:11.125
Well, the only wizard under these skies

16:13.250 --> 16:14.666
is the Dark Wizard.

16:14.750 --> 16:17.666
And the last friend we need
is a friend of his.

16:18.166 --> 16:19.041
Tie 'em up.

16:19.541 --> 16:21.875
[Poppy] What?
What? No.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.875
What? Let her go. What Dark Wizard?

16:27.666 --> 16:31.875
[Brânk] The Istar is already much more
powerful than we had anticipated.

16:33.500 --> 16:37.291
He conjured a sandstorm from thin air
that killed two of my men,

16:38.875 --> 16:41.125
He makes his way north now.

16:41.208 --> 16:43.583
Towards... the hermit.

16:46.416 --> 16:48.416
[Dark Wizard] And what of the halflings?

16:49.625 --> 16:51.541
[Brânk] We are scouring the desert
even now.

16:52.375 --> 16:54.291
They will not evade us for long.

16:55.000 --> 16:57.625
I swear my life on it.

16:57.708 --> 17:01.625
You are either very foolish, Gaudrim,

17:02.958 --> 17:05.083
or very brave.

17:07.375 --> 17:11.208
Let the Harfoots be your sole concern.

17:11.291 --> 17:14.375
I will see to the Istar myself.

17:24.125 --> 17:25.208
[Old Man Ironwood growling]

17:25.291 --> 17:27.208
[Tom] Let him out again.

17:28.875 --> 17:31.375
You should not be wakin'.

17:32.125 --> 17:35.833
Eat earth. Dig deep.

17:36.791 --> 17:38.958
Drink water, hmm?

17:40.333 --> 17:42.166
Go to sleep.

17:43.166 --> 17:44.208
[grunts]

17:44.291 --> 17:46.666
[shushes]

17:46.750 --> 17:49.125
-[Old Man Ironwood growling]
-[shushes]

17:50.083 --> 17:52.500
Who... Who are you?

17:55.291 --> 17:57.875
Been awhile since I've been
called much of anythin',

17:59.125 --> 18:02.625
but back in the Withywindle,
folk used to call me Bombadil.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.291
Tom Bombadil.

18:07.041 --> 18:12.041
[singing] Down west sinks the sun
Soon you will be gropin'

18:12.958 --> 18:15.625
Don't be bashful now, Goldberry...

18:15.708 --> 18:19.000
[Goldberry singing]
When the night-shadows fall

18:19.083 --> 18:21.708
[both] Then the door will open

18:21.791 --> 18:23.583
[object clattering]

18:27.166 --> 18:30.125
I've done such as I can
with your filthy robe.

18:33.583 --> 18:35.375
Well, clean your hands, wash your face,

18:35.458 --> 18:37.125
then come join me by the fire.

18:39.625 --> 18:43.000
Is, uh... Is somebody out there with you?

18:44.250 --> 18:46.500
I thought I heard a woman singing.

18:46.583 --> 18:49.791
Woman? What woman?

18:51.291 --> 18:53.333
Is no one else here with you?

18:55.583 --> 18:56.833
You're here.

18:57.958 --> 18:59.583
That is, I think you are. Are you?

19:01.916 --> 19:04.291
Uh... Yes?

19:05.750 --> 19:06.916
[laughs]

19:13.416 --> 19:15.083
[Tom humming]

19:20.708 --> 19:26.583
Now, what was it that you were hopin'
to find under those stars of yours, huh?

19:27.291 --> 19:29.041
Certainly not old Tom.

19:31.541 --> 19:33.166
I was hoping to find my friends.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.625
Shows what stars know, doesn't it?

19:38.625 --> 19:40.625
Newcomers, that's what they are.

19:40.708 --> 19:41.875
One year, it's dark.

19:41.958 --> 19:43.708
The next, you look up,

19:45.291 --> 19:49.500
there's a sea of tiny eyes
lookin' down at ya, a-watching.

19:51.708 --> 19:55.916
Now, they think they know everythin',
but newcomers. Hmm?

19:57.166 --> 19:58.583
Still newcomers.

20:00.500 --> 20:03.458
[gasps] Wha...

20:05.916 --> 20:07.333
What are you?

20:08.458 --> 20:12.083
Don't you know my name yet?
That's the only answer.

20:14.083 --> 20:15.916
Tell me, who are you,

20:16.000 --> 20:18.750
alone, yourself, and nameless?

20:19.583 --> 20:24.041
But you are young, and I am old.

20:25.958 --> 20:28.333
Eldest, that's what I am.

20:30.833 --> 20:32.250
What do you mean, "Eldest"?

20:34.500 --> 20:35.875
Eldest.

20:37.500 --> 20:40.083
Mark my words, friend,

20:40.166 --> 20:43.375
Tom was there
before the river and the trees.

20:44.416 --> 20:47.625
Tom remembers the first raindrop
and the first acorn.

20:48.541 --> 20:52.291
He knew the dark under the stars
when it was fearless.

20:55.083 --> 20:59.791
This whole place used to be green.
Now, it's all sand.

21:02.333 --> 21:05.083
I had to come see for myself
to believe it.

21:06.750 --> 21:08.583
Even the birdsong isn't wholly untouched.

21:09.083 --> 21:12.500
Even your tree out there.
Old Man Ironwood.

21:12.583 --> 21:14.166
-I thought it--
-Uh...

21:14.250 --> 21:18.958
He... might be able to, lend me a branch.

21:19.041 --> 21:21.250
Oh, well you should've tried askin' him.

21:22.791 --> 21:25.791
[yawns]

21:27.458 --> 21:28.541
[bleats]

21:28.625 --> 21:33.291
Easy, Iarwain. Easy.

21:33.375 --> 21:34.500
-[bleats]
-[Tom grunts]

21:35.125 --> 21:36.125
I know.

21:37.416 --> 21:41.458
This... magic. Can you teach it to me?

21:42.750 --> 21:47.333
Teach you? What's to learn way out 'ere?

21:50.708 --> 21:55.416
You wield power over trees,
over wind and fire.

21:55.500 --> 21:58.208
You wield it, as if it belongs to you.

21:58.291 --> 22:00.583
All things belong each to themselves.

22:01.791 --> 22:04.208
Just as you belong to yourself.

22:04.291 --> 22:09.708
Then, might you teach me
how to wield a staff?

22:10.833 --> 22:14.333
A wizard's staff is like a name.

22:15.375 --> 22:20.375
It's yours to wield already,
if you prove yourself worthy of it.

22:21.625 --> 22:25.916
You showed today that you're not. Yet.

22:28.458 --> 22:33.458
Whether you can become so,
well, we shall soon discover.

22:38.750 --> 22:41.333
I was never meant to find a staff
under these stars.

22:43.750 --> 22:47.000
I was meant to find you. Wasn't I?

22:48.250 --> 22:49.458
[chuckles softly]

22:51.083 --> 22:52.708
[horse whinnies]

22:54.708 --> 22:55.708
What is it?

22:56.875 --> 22:58.083
We're not alone.

23:01.958 --> 23:02.875
[horse whinnies]

23:02.958 --> 23:04.208
[sinister music playing]

23:04.291 --> 23:05.541
[Stranger] Who are they?

23:09.291 --> 23:11.500
Why do they hunt me, and my friends?

23:14.708 --> 23:17.958
You are not the first Istar
who's eaten honey by my fire.

23:19.541 --> 23:22.208
Years ago, there was another.

23:22.750 --> 23:24.500
The Dark Wizard.

23:27.958 --> 23:29.125
What became of him?

23:31.625 --> 23:34.333
Once, he sought to control magic,
like you.

23:37.666 --> 23:39.791
Now, he controls much of Rhûn.

23:41.791 --> 23:43.458
But still, he hungers for more.

23:44.833 --> 23:48.416
You believe his evil will spread?

23:49.625 --> 23:53.666
Not without an ally
far more powerful even than himself.

23:55.333 --> 23:56.666
Sauron.

24:00.291 --> 24:02.750
If these two flames combine into one,

24:04.250 --> 24:08.166
there will be no end to burnin',
till all Middle-earth is ashes.

24:12.458 --> 24:14.375
Can you stop it?

24:17.166 --> 24:19.583
Old Tom's a wanderer, not a warrior.

24:20.666 --> 24:23.750
Great deeds are left
to the hands they were placed in.

24:26.750 --> 24:31.166
And I shall gather lilies,
while yet they grow.

24:33.166 --> 24:34.583
You mean...

24:37.541 --> 24:38.750
You mean my hands.

24:48.833 --> 24:51.291
Is it my task to stop the fire?

24:52.666 --> 24:55.125
Is it my task to face Sauron?

24:57.916 --> 25:02.625
Your task... is to face them both.

25:19.750 --> 25:21.125
[rustling]

25:31.500 --> 25:34.666
[Voice on the Wind whispering]
I am waiting for you.

25:43.541 --> 25:45.125
[Daemor] What is this place?

25:48.000 --> 25:49.250
Tyrn Gorthad.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.208
Known to Men as the Barrow-downs.

25:54.916 --> 25:58.916
In ancient days, this was where
they laid their lords and kings to rest.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.625
I feel no rest here.

26:04.125 --> 26:06.375
Even the trees seem ill at ease.

26:07.666 --> 26:08.583
[Vorohil] Fear not.

26:08.666 --> 26:10.833
Dead Men are no threat.

26:13.333 --> 26:14.416
[Elrond] Keep moving.

26:21.208 --> 26:25.041
[Voices on the Wind whispering]
Cold be hand and heart and bone

26:25.125 --> 26:29.000
And cold be sleep under stone

26:37.375 --> 26:39.583
[intense music playing]

-[grunts]

26:48.750 --> 26:50.666
[eerie music playing]

26:50.750 --> 26:54.708
For a moment, I thought I heard...

26:54.791 --> 26:56.083
Heard?

26:57.875 --> 26:59.000
What did you hear?

27:00.625 --> 27:02.166
It was almost like a song.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.666
Or the memory of a song.

27:18.041 --> 27:18.958
Galadriel.

27:27.250 --> 27:29.083
Their barding is from Lindon.

27:31.833 --> 27:34.333
The King sent a dispatch
to warn Celebrimbor.

27:36.166 --> 27:37.708
This dispatch?

27:40.916 --> 27:42.708
We must go from this place.

27:45.958 --> 27:49.375
-[whooshing]
-[grunting]

27:49.458 --> 27:51.750
-Daemor!
-Hold on to me.

27:51.833 --> 27:53.083
Don't let go!

27:53.166 --> 27:55.583
[both grunting]

27:55.666 --> 27:57.708
-[Daemor screams]
-[Voice on the Wind growling]

27:57.791 --> 28:00.000
[all panting]

28:04.291 --> 28:06.875
[crunching and squelching]

28:06.958 --> 28:09.875
[Voices on the Wind] Cold old be hand
and heart and bone

28:10.583 --> 28:13.875
And cold be sleep under stone

28:14.500 --> 28:17.916
Never more to wake on stony bed

28:18.000 --> 28:21.791
Never, till the Sun fails
and the Moon is dead

28:21.875 --> 28:23.375
[rustling]

28:27.125 --> 28:30.083
In the black wind the stars shall die

28:35.541 --> 28:37.125
Prepare yourselves.

28:43.583 --> 28:44.666
What are they?

28:45.458 --> 28:46.708
Barrow-wights.

28:46.791 --> 28:49.125
[Barrow-wights growling]

28:59.708 --> 29:01.000
[in Elvish] Attack!

29:01.958 --> 29:02.875
[grunts]

29:03.666 --> 29:04.958

29:13.958 --> 29:16.125
[screams]

29:19.208 --> 29:21.250
[clanking]

29:25.666 --> 29:26.750
Still your arrows!

29:30.375 --> 29:31.250
[speaking Sindarin]

29:33.208 --> 29:35.000
[Barrow-wight hisses]

29:36.208 --> 29:37.875
[Camnir in English] They're impervious
to our weapons.

29:38.916 --> 29:40.291
[hisses]

29:42.625 --> 29:44.458
Hold fast. Come with me.

29:44.541 --> 29:45.750
Where are you going?

29:45.833 --> 29:46.833
-Help me open it.
-[Camnir] What?

29:46.916 --> 29:48.500
[in Sindarin] Hurry!

29:48.583 --> 29:49.708

[grunting]

30:04.000 --> 30:05.000
[shrieks]

30:10.125 --> 30:11.125
Take it.

30:13.208 --> 30:14.500
[growls]

30:15.083 --> 30:17.708
-[grunts]
-[shrieks]

30:26.625 --> 30:27.458
[Rían] How?

30:27.541 --> 30:28.666
According to lore,

30:28.750 --> 30:32.000
only the blades with which they were
buried will return such creatures to rest.

30:32.083 --> 30:35.458
But the Men buried here have been entombed
for over a thousand years.

30:35.541 --> 30:37.958
I think it is safe to say
that something has awoken them.

30:38.041 --> 30:39.458
No.

30:41.083 --> 30:42.500
Someone.

30:43.625 --> 30:45.208
Awakening evil.

30:46.333 --> 30:48.708
Across all of Middle-earth.

30:48.791 --> 30:52.666
[Isildur] Theo! Theo!

30:52.750 --> 30:54.750
-[female Southlander 1] Theo!
-[male Southlander 1] Theo!

30:54.833 --> 30:57.208
-Theo!
-[male Southlander 2] Theo!

30:57.291 --> 30:59.125
-[male Southlander 3] Theo!
-Theo!

31:01.000 --> 31:02.000
[male Southlander 4] Theo!

31:03.083 --> 31:03.958
[male Southlander 5] Theo!

31:08.041 --> 31:09.833
-[male Southlander 6] Theo!
-[female Southlander 2] Theo!

31:13.583 --> 31:15.500
[eerie music playing]

31:20.000 --> 31:21.625
They left all their weapons.

31:24.375 --> 31:27.333
To a Wildman, an axe-head
is worth more than gold.

31:28.041 --> 31:30.250
Strange, they did not take it with them.

31:31.791 --> 31:34.791
Come, all of you. We move on.

31:36.625 --> 31:38.458
This way. Let's go.

31:40.375 --> 31:42.333
[indistinct chatter]

31:42.416 --> 31:43.916
Do not torture yourself, Númenórean.

31:45.625 --> 31:47.500
Theo has survived far worse.

31:49.083 --> 31:50.375
He will weather this.

31:50.458 --> 31:51.666
[male Southlander 1] Theo!

31:55.750 --> 31:57.083
[female Southlander] Theo!

32:06.416 --> 32:07.541
[male Southlander 2] Theo!

32:09.708 --> 32:11.791
You there. This way.

32:29.625 --> 32:33.541
[birds screeching, cawing]

32:43.125 --> 32:45.291
[man] I say we raid their camps.

32:45.375 --> 32:47.000
[Isildur] We'd be starting a war.

32:47.083 --> 32:50.041
-We're already at war, Sea-folk.
-[people assenting]

32:50.125 --> 32:54.375
What I saw,
I do not believe was done by mortal Men.

32:54.458 --> 32:58.458
They're not Men. They're animals.
They'd eat human flesh if they had to.

32:58.541 --> 33:01.375
Every minute we waste
is another Theo's still out there.

33:01.458 --> 33:02.666
We've got to keep searching.

33:02.750 --> 33:06.916
We could canvass Eastfield Glen.
Whispers are, Wildmen camp there.

33:07.000 --> 33:08.000
[female Southlander] That's a good idea.

33:08.083 --> 33:09.708
You'd do better to look north.

33:12.208 --> 33:13.291
Why north?

33:15.458 --> 33:19.083
I've spent weeks searching these lands,
lookin' for loved ones.

33:19.166 --> 33:21.000
That part of the forest is old.

33:21.083 --> 33:23.375
Promise you, there are Wildmen there,
and worse.

33:23.458 --> 33:24.625
[murmuring]

33:24.708 --> 33:26.000
[female Southlander] You might be right.

33:26.083 --> 33:27.166
Arondir.

33:30.250 --> 33:33.625
[Arondir] Let's not waste any daylight.
Gather water and provisions.

33:33.708 --> 33:35.000
[male Southlander] Let's get a move on.

33:41.791 --> 33:43.416
-[creaking]
-[Estrid and Isildur grunting]

33:44.375 --> 33:45.291
Oh!

33:47.208 --> 33:48.291
[chuckles]

33:48.375 --> 33:49.375
There you go.

33:57.541 --> 33:58.750
You missed a spot.

34:06.833 --> 34:07.833
[Isildur] Thanks.

34:09.750 --> 34:12.041
Fancy you never want
for water on your island.

34:13.166 --> 34:15.750
No. In Númenor,
we have water in most of our homes.

34:16.416 --> 34:17.916
I'd like to see that.

34:19.541 --> 34:21.208
I wager your betrothed would too.

34:25.666 --> 34:27.208
We ought to keep moving.

34:27.291 --> 34:28.416
In a moment.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.583
You say you spent time
among the Wildmen, Estrid.

34:32.458 --> 34:33.333
How much?

34:34.625 --> 34:37.125
Uh, I wasn't exactly among them.
I was hidin'.

34:38.541 --> 34:40.833
-Did they ever do you harm?
-Arondir, what are you...

34:40.916 --> 34:43.375
I ask because I noticed
a wound on your neck.

34:44.291 --> 34:45.291
Looks to be recent.

34:46.625 --> 34:50.833
No. That was my fault.
I, um... fell asleep by the fire.

34:50.916 --> 34:52.916
I should've put it out,
but the night was cold.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.083
It was foolish of me.

34:54.166 --> 34:56.958
We all do foolish things sometimes.

34:57.041 --> 34:59.750
Especially in moments of hopelessness.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.416
[both grunting]

35:03.500 --> 35:05.250
[both breathing heavily]

35:05.333 --> 35:08.000
[grunting]

35:10.458 --> 35:12.291
Estrid, what is this?

35:12.375 --> 35:13.916
Self-burn.

35:14.000 --> 35:16.583
The Wildmen do it
to hide the Mark of Adar.

35:17.208 --> 35:20.208
We would have caught her at the gate
had she not come in with you.

35:20.291 --> 35:22.125
She's a Wildman?

35:22.208 --> 35:24.250
She's one of them.

35:24.333 --> 35:26.583
And she's going to lead us
to all the others.

35:38.083 --> 35:39.166
[Isildur] What was your plan?

35:41.458 --> 35:43.958
Stab me? Take my horse?

35:44.916 --> 35:47.458
Was that it? No?

35:47.541 --> 35:51.208
Then you saw I was a Númenórean.
Had a better idea, didn't you?

35:52.625 --> 35:53.666
[scoffs]

35:53.750 --> 35:55.291
You were using me all along.

35:55.958 --> 35:57.583
Wager you don't even have a betrothed.

35:57.666 --> 36:00.208
-Would you rather I died in Mordor?
-I don't know.

36:00.916 --> 36:02.500
Let me think.

36:14.708 --> 36:15.875
What is it?

36:25.416 --> 36:26.625
Be still.

36:32.291 --> 36:33.666
[speaks Sindarin]

36:33.750 --> 36:34.750
[in English]
Come quickly.

36:35.416 --> 36:37.541
Theo was not taken by Men at all.

36:38.250 --> 36:40.000
-[sinister music playing]
-[creature groaning]

36:44.750 --> 36:48.125
[wood creaking]

36:49.458 --> 36:50.833
[breathing heavily]

37:00.708 --> 37:01.708
-[Hagen] Look.
-[gasps]

37:03.541 --> 37:04.791
Well-fed's awake.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.958
[Wildman 1 coughing]

37:10.333 --> 37:13.291
-[rumbling]
-[prisoners shouting]

37:13.375 --> 37:14.458
[Wildman 2] Help!

37:15.666 --> 37:17.333
[creature groaning]

37:19.875 --> 37:21.416
What's out there?

37:21.500 --> 37:25.000
Don't know yet.
But whatever they are, they're big.

37:42.166 --> 37:43.125
[Arondir] Watch your step.

37:49.583 --> 37:51.416
[both grunting]

37:51.500 --> 37:52.791
[panting]

37:55.958 --> 37:58.958
Might be easier to balance
if I had use of my hands.

37:59.041 --> 38:00.666
And easier to escape.

38:00.750 --> 38:01.875
[sighs in exasperation]

38:01.958 --> 38:04.291
No one could escape in this.

38:04.375 --> 38:05.583
Come on, unlock me.

38:05.666 --> 38:06.958
[Isildur grunts]

38:12.541 --> 38:13.666
It's all right.

38:14.750 --> 38:15.625
[grunts]

38:15.708 --> 38:17.083
Be still.

38:17.166 --> 38:18.500
I said it's all right.

38:20.166 --> 38:21.125
[grunts]

38:23.875 --> 38:24.833
Give me your hand.

38:24.916 --> 38:26.958
-[bubbling]
-Help!

38:27.708 --> 38:30.041
[both grunting]

38:33.458 --> 38:34.458
[bubbling]

38:34.541 --> 38:35.583
Lift me up.

38:37.916 --> 38:39.250
I'm going down.

38:40.125 --> 38:42.125
[both grunting]

39:17.333 --> 39:19.791
[grunting]

39:20.750 --> 39:22.291
[breathing heavily]

39:30.416 --> 39:33.166
[hisses]

39:34.291 --> 39:35.416
[gasps]

39:43.625 --> 39:46.791
[shrieking]

39:53.541 --> 39:54.541
What was that?

39:54.625 --> 39:57.416
There are nameless things
in the deep places of this world.

40:00.583 --> 40:02.041
This one...

40:04.250 --> 40:06.125
we shall call "supper."

40:06.791 --> 40:10.125
[laughs]

40:15.750 --> 40:18.166
[Gundabale] Right, I've conferred
with the village elders.

40:18.750 --> 40:23.875
You two are to be cast out at sunrise.
Sorry, but Stoors must come first.

40:23.958 --> 40:26.958
Truth is, he was in your place...

40:29.458 --> 40:31.791
Sadoc likely would've done the same thing.

40:32.291 --> 40:33.666
Sadoc?

40:33.750 --> 40:37.291
Our trail-finder.
He was called Sadoc Burrows.

40:38.541 --> 40:42.375
Sadoc Burrows was your leader's name?

40:46.875 --> 40:50.708
Just so's we're both working
with a full bushel, I don't believe you.

40:51.666 --> 40:54.958
I'm only showin' you this
to make good and sure.

40:55.666 --> 40:56.875
Sure of what?

41:01.125 --> 41:05.708
Story goes, in ancient days,
there was a Stoor.

41:05.791 --> 41:07.791
Wasn't like the rest of us.

41:07.875 --> 41:13.833
They say he dreamed one night of a place,
with endless streams of cold water

41:13.916 --> 41:18.500
and rollin' hills so soft,
a family could dig a hole

41:18.583 --> 41:20.625
and live in it in less than a month.

41:21.916 --> 41:24.708
He called it "the Sûzat."

41:26.625 --> 41:29.708
Struck out one year
with a caravan of followers to find it.

41:29.791 --> 41:31.333
Promised, when he did,

41:31.416 --> 41:34.041
he'd send someone back
to gather the rest of us.

41:35.458 --> 41:40.500
But that was the last any of us
ever heard of Rorimas Burrows.

41:48.791 --> 41:50.416
Poppy's walkin' song.

41:51.791 --> 41:54.000
Harfoots have been here before.

41:58.833 --> 42:01.291
Your kind's home, where you come from,

42:01.375 --> 42:02.833
does it look like this?

42:04.541 --> 42:08.000
Have you come back here
to lead us all to the Sûzat?

42:11.000 --> 42:12.291
I think, um...

42:14.500 --> 42:17.916
Rorimas never found the Sûzat.

42:22.125 --> 42:24.041
And after a while...

42:26.666 --> 42:30.166
we just kept wanderin'.

42:39.208 --> 42:41.041
We don't have a home.

42:49.041 --> 42:51.666
[indistinct shouting]

42:55.291 --> 42:59.083
The riders sighted. Big folk.
Comin' this way.

42:59.166 --> 43:01.000
[ominous music playing]

43:09.791 --> 43:11.583
To what do we owe the pleasure of--

43:11.666 --> 43:12.958
[villagers exclaim]

43:33.416 --> 43:37.458
[Brânk] The Harfoots, where are they?

43:45.166 --> 43:50.208
The only halflings we know about
in this desert are Stoors.

43:52.583 --> 43:55.250
[Brânk] Do you know
why we wear these masks?

43:56.458 --> 44:00.500
Defy the Dark Wizard
and, when we return with him,

44:00.583 --> 44:02.958
you will find out for yourselves.

44:33.083 --> 44:36.000
[Galadriel] I know you believe this Ring
is deceiving me.

44:36.583 --> 44:39.208
But I believe it is guiding me,

44:40.125 --> 44:43.750
and that following it
may be our only path to victory.

44:45.000 --> 44:48.375
Is there no point at which
the cost of victory becomes too great?

44:51.041 --> 44:53.458
I have yet to reach that point.

44:53.541 --> 44:55.041
How does that not terrify you?

44:55.125 --> 44:59.875
Because the suffering
of a world ruled by Sauron

44:59.958 --> 45:01.666
terrifies me more.

45:04.708 --> 45:10.458
I have always felt it.
But with this Ring, I can see it.

45:11.458 --> 45:15.291
Everything we stand to lose
if we fail in the task before us.

45:19.666 --> 45:23.416
My father foresaw that, one day,

45:23.500 --> 45:25.791
Celebrimbor's life would be in my hands.

45:27.833 --> 45:31.833
I will choose the path I must to give me
the best hope of protecting it.

45:34.875 --> 45:38.166
Protecting that which is most fragile,

45:40.000 --> 45:45.125
most dear,
is a task entrusted to all Elves.

45:50.750 --> 45:52.666
And one that is not yet complete.

45:55.208 --> 46:00.708
And I promise you,
there will be more painful sacrifices.

46:04.916 --> 46:07.625
-[sinister music playing]
-[screaming]

46:07.708 --> 46:09.041
Galadriel?

46:10.500 --> 46:12.166
Promise me, Elrond,

46:13.958 --> 46:17.416
you will put opposing Sauron
above all other considerations.

46:18.750 --> 46:19.958
Even my life.

46:20.958 --> 46:24.375
I will make no promise
whose asking is borne of that Ring.

46:29.708 --> 46:31.416
But I swear to you...

46:33.375 --> 46:35.625
defeating Sauron will come first.

46:37.333 --> 46:38.958
Even before you.

46:39.125 --> 46:41.000
[footsteps approaching]

46:41.583 --> 46:45.500
Forgive me, commander, we heard drums.

46:48.791 --> 46:50.583
[dramatic music playing]

47:26.666 --> 47:28.333
Is that the key to the manacles?

47:29.625 --> 47:32.625
Believe he meant for you
to decide whether or not to use it.

47:54.875 --> 47:55.875
I'm sorry.

47:59.125 --> 48:00.250
So am I.

48:03.083 --> 48:05.916
No. Isildur, y'see...

48:07.708 --> 48:08.666
[grunts]

48:08.750 --> 48:10.583
[dramatic music playing]

48:10.666 --> 48:13.125
Forgiveness doesn't come to folk like me.

48:14.750 --> 48:17.166
Sooner or later, they'll cast me out,
you know they will.

48:18.791 --> 48:20.250
[bowstring tightens]

48:25.333 --> 48:26.625
I won't let them.

48:29.250 --> 48:30.875
I won't let them cast you out.

48:33.625 --> 48:35.166
Put down the sword.

48:39.875 --> 48:41.541
[rumbling]

48:42.666 --> 48:45.125
[thudding]

48:49.791 --> 48:51.791
Estrid, drop the sword!

48:56.333 --> 48:57.458
[grunts]

48:58.250 --> 48:59.583
Estrid!

49:06.166 --> 49:07.375
[in Sindarin] Stop!

49:12.083 --> 49:15.166
[in English] I am Arondir,
of the Greenwood.

49:18.041 --> 49:22.916
Hast thou ever touched axe to wooded life?

49:25.333 --> 49:27.208
To my great pain, I have, but--

49:27.291 --> 49:29.750
[Winterbloom wailing]

49:29.833 --> 49:31.541
[in Sindarin] Listen to me!

49:33.000 --> 49:33.833
[gasps]

49:39.583 --> 49:40.583
[grunts]

49:52.208 --> 49:53.625
[in English] It is not for felling trees.

49:58.208 --> 50:00.625
What does it fell?

50:00.708 --> 50:02.125
Orcs.

50:06.666 --> 50:07.875
[whispers] Stay back.

50:10.166 --> 50:11.291
There was an...

50:13.166 --> 50:14.916
an army of them.

50:15.000 --> 50:19.083
Maiming and murdering as they marched.

50:20.125 --> 50:21.583
We saw what they did.

50:22.625 --> 50:26.208
Is that why you're here?
Why you're so angry?

50:28.291 --> 50:34.291
The spilling sap and burning branch
called to us from afar.

50:35.833 --> 50:39.583
But... we were too late.

50:39.666 --> 50:42.666
An army? How long ago was this?

50:42.750 --> 50:46.875
Winterbloom nourished many of those trees
from seed and sprout.

50:46.958 --> 50:49.833
-Do not ask her to speak more of it.
-[Winterbloom sobs]

50:49.916 --> 50:51.666
[Winterbloom]
They are no different from them!

50:56.333 --> 51:01.125
Disemboweling, and uprooting,
branch-breakers and trunk-splitters, all!

51:07.416 --> 51:08.333
[in Sindarin] We would seek...

51:09.250 --> 51:11.041
[groans softly]

51:16.000 --> 51:17.333
your forgiveness...

51:26.041 --> 51:27.333
for the injury...

51:36.500 --> 51:37.708
...we have done.

51:50.541 --> 51:53.583
[in English] Forgiveness takes an age.

52:01.166 --> 52:06.291
Rain washing clear
the long memory of soil.

52:06.375 --> 52:10.875
New bark, covering old scars.

52:11.666 --> 52:15.458
And in all that time, I promise,

52:15.541 --> 52:19.916
we will see to it that the trees
of this wood are left in peace.

52:38.208 --> 52:40.083
Think they know what peace is?

52:40.166 --> 52:44.000
It is what comes after the night storms,

52:44.083 --> 52:47.958
when the dawn is silent,
and the birds awaken.

52:48.708 --> 52:53.208
We have tended this forest

52:53.291 --> 52:57.291
since before the mountains
rose up and divided it.

53:00.791 --> 53:06.625
When the only sound here
was the light upon the moss...

53:11.250 --> 53:12.333
Theo?

53:12.416 --> 53:15.833
And the breathing of the leaves.

53:19.583 --> 53:24.500
Yes. We know peace.

53:24.583 --> 53:27.291
Estrid? It's me.

53:27.375 --> 53:29.416
-[rain pattering]
-[grunts]

53:36.875 --> 53:39.250
Estrid? Estrid.

53:41.250 --> 53:42.250
Hagen?

53:44.500 --> 53:46.791
-What... I thought you...
-So did I.

53:50.750 --> 53:53.875
[Estrid] I can't believe you're here.
Look at you.

54:12.458 --> 54:14.416
[footsteps thudding]

54:20.625 --> 54:22.250
Thank you for coming for me.

54:26.625 --> 54:28.166
I made a promise.

54:29.708 --> 54:31.125
Thank you for keepin' it.

54:35.708 --> 54:37.291
Now I must keep another.

54:38.875 --> 54:43.541
Orcs are on the move.
I must follow the trail where it leads.

54:44.625 --> 54:47.083
Perhaps have another chance
to confront Adar.

54:50.708 --> 54:52.625
You can come with me, if you wish.

54:56.833 --> 54:58.666
I have promises of my own to keep.

55:06.375 --> 55:10.250
Then mae glenno. Lord of Pelargir.

55:17.583 --> 55:19.041
[sinister music playing]

55:30.208 --> 55:32.083
[snarling]

55:33.458 --> 55:36.333
[indistinct chanting]

55:48.375 --> 55:49.916
Orc-treachery.

55:50.000 --> 55:51.416
That trail.

55:52.791 --> 55:54.041
I gather it leads to--

55:54.125 --> 55:56.166
Eregion, my liege.

55:57.041 --> 56:01.333
We came in search of Sauron.
And instead, we find Adar?

56:01.833 --> 56:03.791
Could they
be in league with each other or...

56:05.708 --> 56:06.916
Perhaps at war.

56:07.000 --> 56:09.375
A legion of Orcs
have marched into Elvish lands.

56:10.375 --> 56:12.083
We are all of us at war.

56:14.875 --> 56:18.541
Word of this must reach the High King
before our host sails for Mordor.

56:22.875 --> 56:23.916
[Orc] There!

56:24.000 --> 56:25.375
-[arrows thudding]
-[horse whinnies]

56:28.416 --> 56:29.541
[in Elvish] Hold!

56:30.375 --> 56:32.333
[Snaghûl, in English]
But that's our supper gettin' away!

56:32.416 --> 56:34.416
-[grunts]
-[horse whinnies]

56:34.500 --> 56:35.666
[Snaghûl] Come on!

56:36.958 --> 56:38.458
Back in line!

56:38.541 --> 56:39.833
[snarls]

56:41.208 --> 56:44.083
[Snaghûl] Who is it?
Keep looking. [laughs]

56:45.041 --> 56:48.958
[groaning and choking]

56:49.041 --> 56:50.458
[snarls]

56:50.541 --> 56:52.958
[sniffs]

56:53.916 --> 56:55.541
[chuckles]

56:56.291 --> 56:59.500
-[coughs]
-[Snaghûl] They're nearby. Keep lookin'.

57:00.416 --> 57:01.625
[muffled whimpering]

57:01.708 --> 57:04.000
[Snaghûl] Who is it? What was that?

57:06.083 --> 57:07.416
[Borzag] Came from over here.

57:08.375 --> 57:10.541
[Snaghûl] I can smell an Elf.

57:11.916 --> 57:13.083
[Camnir, muffled whimpering]

57:36.458 --> 57:37.416
[in Sindarin] Amazing.

57:37.500 --> 57:39.750
[Borzag, in English]
Leave no stone unturned. Go!

57:39.833 --> 57:43.583
Get to Lindon.
I will occupy them as long as I am able.

57:47.375 --> 57:48.458
[Borzag] Keep looking.

57:49.208 --> 57:50.458
Take it.

57:55.083 --> 57:56.625
Take it, Elrond.

57:59.166 --> 58:00.458
Over there.

58:00.541 --> 58:01.958
[Orcs laughing]

58:07.500 --> 58:10.000
Where's the rest?

58:11.958 --> 58:13.125
I stand alone.

58:14.375 --> 58:16.625
Cut off her right thumb.

58:17.958 --> 58:21.875
Tell us where the others are,
I'll let you keep the left.

58:21.958 --> 58:24.375
-[all laughing]
-[grunts]

58:26.125 --> 58:28.958
[all grunting]

58:35.083 --> 58:36.750
[Orcs screaming]

58:42.250 --> 58:43.291
[grunts]

58:47.291 --> 58:48.708
-[Orcs snarling]
-[horse whinnies]

58:52.458 --> 58:53.625
[grunts]

59:02.541 --> 59:05.916
[Orcs screaming]

59:09.083 --> 59:11.208
[panting]

59:11.291 --> 59:14.041
She sacrificed herself to save us all.

59:19.041 --> 59:21.166
No, you are mistaken, Camnir.

59:23.708 --> 59:26.125
[in Sindarin]
She did not do it to save us.

59:28.208 --> 59:29.458
What?

59:29.541 --> 59:31.791
She did it to save the ring.

59:33.875 --> 59:34.875
[in English] Hurry.

59:35.541 --> 59:37.166
[horse whinnies]

59:41.583 --> 59:43.291
These are Elven lands.

59:44.416 --> 59:46.708
[Orcs snarling]

59:47.375 --> 59:49.083
Go back to the shadow.

59:53.125 --> 59:54.541
[grunts]

01:00:01.333 --> 01:00:04.583
[in Quenya] A star shines on the hour
of our meeting...

01:00:04.666 --> 01:00:06.666
Lady Galadriel.

01:00:12.083 --> 01:00:15.791
[in English] Now let the song begin

01:00:15.875 --> 01:00:19.166
Let us sing together

01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:23.166
Of sun, stars, moon and mist,

01:00:23.250 --> 01:00:26.875
Rain and cloudy weather

01:00:26.958 --> 01:00:30.583
Light on the budding leaf

01:00:30.666 --> 01:00:34.250
Dew on the feather

01:00:34.333 --> 01:00:37.958
Wind on the open hill

01:00:38.041 --> 01:00:40.708
Bells on the heather

01:00:40.791 --> 01:00:45.041
O slender as a willow-wand

01:00:45.125 --> 01:00:48.125
O clearer than clear water

01:00:48.208 --> 01:00:52.750
O reed by the living pool

01:00:52.833 --> 01:00:55.500
Fair River-daughter

01:00:55.583 --> 01:00:59.791
O springtime and summertime

01:00:59.875 --> 01:01:03.041
And spring again after

01:01:03.125 --> 01:01:07.500
O wind on the waterfall

01:01:07.583 --> 01:01:11.208
And the leaves' laughter

01:01:11.291 --> 01:01:14.958
Old Tom Bombadil

01:01:15.041 --> 01:01:18.583
Is a merry fellow

01:01:18.666 --> 01:01:22.250
Bright blue his jacket is

01:01:22.333 --> 01:01:25.958
And his boots are yellow

01:01:26.041 --> 01:01:29.666
Reeds by the shady pool

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:33.333
Lilies on the water

01:01:33.416 --> 01:01:37.041
Old Tom Bombadil

01:01:37.125 --> 01:01:39.791
And the River-daughter

01:01:39.875 --> 01:01:44.083
O slender as a willow-wand

01:01:44.166 --> 01:01:47.250
O clearer than clear water

01:01:47.333 --> 01:01:51.791
O reed by the living pool

01:01:51.875 --> 01:01:54.666
Fair River-daughter

01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:58.791
O springtime and summertime

01:01:58.875 --> 01:02:02.041
And spring again after

01:02:02.125 --> 01:02:06.458
O wind on the waterfall

01:02:06.541 --> 01:02:09.166
And the leaves' laughter
