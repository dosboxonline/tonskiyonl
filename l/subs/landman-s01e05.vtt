Excuse me, if I may.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.844
What you're not seeing
in the States

12:23.944 --> 12:26.914
is this rabid opposition
to fossil fuels of any kind.

12:27.080 --> 12:28.816
To their use,
to their extraction--

12:28.916 --> 12:31.351
38% of the UK's electricity
came from

12:31.484 --> 12:32.419
natural gas piped in

12:32.585 --> 12:33.453
- from Norway, Steve.
- Gentlemen...

12:33.586 --> 12:35.255
But-but one quarter's from wind,

12:35.422 --> 12:37.457
which I agree is
unreliable and expensive, but--

12:37.590 --> 12:39.192
and this is an important "but"--

12:39.292 --> 12:40.794
- Steve...
- [Bob] Energy consumption

12:40.928 --> 12:42.462
is not a social issue, Steve.

12:42.595 --> 12:44.164
The hell it's not.
It's deeply social.

12:46.066 --> 12:48.435
And we must endeavor ourselves
to educate the world

12:48.568 --> 12:50.570
about our commitment
to cleaner ener--

12:50.703 --> 12:52.639
Steve, will you
shut the fuck up? My God.

12:52.806 --> 12:54.474
This is why
I don't come to these things.

12:55.943 --> 12:58.879
Y'all have been in so many
shareholder meetings, you forgot

12:58.979 --> 13:00.580
what it is
we actually do for a living.

13:00.713 --> 13:02.415
We are well diggers.

13:02.549 --> 13:04.484
We don't, nor can we ever,

13:04.617 --> 13:08.221
control how our product is used
or what it is used for.

13:08.321 --> 13:09.923
There's nothing I can do
to make an engine run cleaner

13:10.057 --> 13:12.159
'cause I don't build
fucking engines.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.561
I don't care what
the governor of California says

13:14.694 --> 13:16.029
about electric vehicles.

13:16.129 --> 13:17.965
I don't care how many
career college students

13:18.131 --> 13:20.700
block London traffic or
spray-paint a fucking sculpture.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.435
I care that the price of oil

13:22.569 --> 13:25.638
stays between
$76 and $88 a barrel.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.975
That is what
we should be discussing.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.676
The world has
already convinced itself

13:29.843 --> 13:31.744
that you are evil and I am evil

13:31.845 --> 13:33.680
for providing them
the one fucking thing

13:33.813 --> 13:35.748
they interact with every day,

13:35.849 --> 13:37.484
and they will not
be convinced otherwise.

13:37.617 --> 13:40.854
Stop wasting your time,
and stop fucking wasting mine.

13:46.994 --> 13:49.396
Gee, Monty,
tell us how you really feel.

13:49.496 --> 13:50.998
[laughter]

13:55.035 --> 13:56.836
You better start caring, Monty.

13:56.970 --> 13:58.838
I mean, your children are
going to inherit an oil fortune,

13:59.006 --> 14:01.008
but your grandchildren won't.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.442
What they inherit,

14:02.575 --> 14:04.177
you're gonna
have to start building now.

14:04.344 --> 14:08.048

not ending tomorrow, but...

she'll always be 17.

the lawn in the back,

20:05.238 --> 20:06.439

Ah.

this feels inappropriate.

Meeting in your residence.

22:26.413 --> 22:28.415
It is also my office.

22:28.515 --> 22:31.217
M-Tex doesn't have
an office in town?

22:31.350 --> 22:33.319
We have remote offices
that move with the rigs

22:33.453 --> 22:35.354
and satellite offices
at the man camps, but I promise,

22:35.488 --> 22:37.790
you would find those
more inappropriate.

22:39.025 --> 22:39.959
Do you want some coffee?

22:41.961 --> 22:43.095
I'm fine.

22:43.195 --> 22:46.198

22:46.332 --> 22:49.035
three widows, eight dependents.

22:49.168 --> 22:51.370
Youngest is three months.

22:51.504 --> 22:54.073
I was thinking something
like 250 per household,

22:54.206 --> 22:55.875
plus a college fund.

22:56.008 --> 22:58.678
Uh... M-Tex could invest
that money now

22:58.811 --> 23:00.179
and essentially pay the tuition
with the ROI,

23:00.312 --> 23:02.882
minus the three teenagers.

23:03.015 --> 23:05.217
It makes for a very attractive
and compassionate offer

23:05.351 --> 23:07.086
that addresses
the short-term needs

23:07.219 --> 23:08.988
and longer-term concerns
of the families.

23:09.088 --> 23:12.892
Are you including the cash value
of their 401(k)s in that 250?

23:13.025 --> 23:15.795
- I am not.
- So in the case of Luis,

23:15.895 --> 23:18.531
it's more like a $600,000 offer.

23:18.665 --> 23:20.767
Not really.
They're entitled to the 401(k)

23:20.900 --> 23:23.636
- regardless of a settlement.
- They don't know that.

23:23.770 --> 23:25.271
Their attorney will.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.306
- Do they have attorneys?
- Not to my knowledge.

23:27.474 --> 23:29.776
We're gonna make this deal
before they get them.

23:29.942 --> 23:31.110
Let me just check

23:31.277 --> 23:32.512
- with the insurance company's--
- Don't you dare.

23:33.946 --> 23:36.549
The insurance company isn't
gonna offer them anything.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.818
They're going to investigate
for a year,

23:38.985 --> 23:41.488
claim it was negligence
on the part of the employees

23:41.621 --> 23:42.955
and then wash their hands of it.

23:43.089 --> 23:44.991
There is no cap

23:45.124 --> 23:48.795
for economic or punitive damages
for wrongful death in Texas.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.564
And this is a $40
or $50 million dollar lawsuit.

23:51.664 --> 23:53.132
Per incident.

23:53.265 --> 23:54.801
We won't let it get that far.

23:54.934 --> 23:57.303
If they don't bite at 250,
we will offer 300.

23:57.470 --> 23:59.472
If they don't bite there, 400.

23:59.639 --> 24:00.940
And if they still don't bite,

24:01.073 --> 24:03.242
I scare the shit out of them
for an hour,

24:03.342 --> 24:04.711
and then we offer 500.

24:04.811 --> 24:07.980
We are leaving each house
with a check on their table

24:08.114 --> 24:09.682
and a fucking signature
on our settlement.

26:05.264 --> 26:07.967
Someone should have plausible
deniability over this disaster.

Number one,
it's our fucking road.

can trace the plane back to me,

38:55.300 --> 38:57.102
I didn't think so.

39:01.707 --> 39:03.775
<i>[classical music
playing on stereo]</i>

39:05.377 --> 39:08.614
What in the fuck
is going on here?

39:15.754 --> 39:17.288
Honey?

39:18.256 --> 39:19.758
Here we go.

39:20.859 --> 39:21.760
Angela.

39:21.927 --> 39:23.662
You said 7, remember?

39:23.795 --> 39:26.398
No, you said 7,
I said I had to work.

39:26.532 --> 39:28.066
- You said you'd try.
- What's all this shit?

39:28.233 --> 39:30.436
- I did try.
- And you failed.

39:30.569 --> 39:32.438
What in the fuck
is all this stuff here?

39:32.571 --> 39:35.474
[laughs] Oh, I just steered into
the West Texas of it, right?

39:35.574 --> 39:36.575
I mean, we're here.

39:36.708 --> 39:37.509
There's no point
in decorating this place

39:37.643 --> 39:38.744
like a condo in Dallas.

39:38.877 --> 39:41.179
Well, where's the furniture
that was in here?

39:41.279 --> 39:42.914
I gave it to the movers.

39:43.081 --> 39:45.250
It don't belong to us.
We rent it.

39:45.383 --> 39:47.586
Well, this is
your furniture now.

39:47.719 --> 39:51.089
From a legal standpoint, no.
This would be...?

39:51.222 --> 39:54.125
- Victor's.
- Victor's furniture, yes.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.762
Charged it to
your husband, did you?

39:56.928 --> 39:59.631
He hasn't checked a credit card
bill in decades, honey.

39:59.798 --> 40:00.766
Well, he don't have to.

40:00.899 --> 40:02.167
That's what his accountant
is for.

40:02.267 --> 40:05.070
- Well, he doesn't either.
- [knocking at door]

40:07.405 --> 40:10.609
[laughs, squeals]

40:18.917 --> 40:21.520
[Angela whimpers] Aw.

40:22.454 --> 40:25.190
Hey, baby, come here.

40:25.290 --> 40:28.760
Oh, my God, you're so skinny.

40:28.894 --> 40:30.428
God, you're filthy.

40:30.562 --> 40:31.597
Have you been playing football?

40:31.730 --> 40:33.999
I-I was helping
a friend mow the lawn.

40:34.165 --> 40:36.167
Mm. Well...

40:36.334 --> 40:37.435
God, wash your hands.

40:37.569 --> 40:39.237
Oh, babe, take your boots off.

40:39.370 --> 40:41.206
And do we have time
for Cooper to take a shower?

40:41.306 --> 40:43.308
Hell, it's your show, honey.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.944
I'm not gonna take a shower.

40:46.077 --> 40:47.546
Okay.

40:48.514 --> 40:50.549
Here, come sit
next to your sister.

40:57.355 --> 40:59.691
You smell like the beach.

40:59.858 --> 41:01.326
You smell like a goat.

41:02.661 --> 41:04.663
- I'll see y'all after a while.
- Sit.

41:04.830 --> 41:06.397
Okay.

41:10.268 --> 41:12.103
[clears throat]

41:19.344 --> 41:22.113
[exhales] Okay.

41:25.116 --> 41:26.518
[sighs]

41:34.492 --> 41:35.561
Mm.

41:50.341 --> 41:54.079
My whole family together
for the first time in...

41:54.212 --> 41:56.582
it's been ten years.

41:59.484 --> 42:01.386
Sorry. I'm just
so fucking happy.

42:01.519 --> 42:04.590
[gasps] Should we bless it?

42:05.591 --> 42:08.794
Why not? I can use anything
I can get today.

42:09.761 --> 42:11.763
Grab hands.

42:15.233 --> 42:17.402
[clears throat]

42:17.535 --> 42:18.637
[exasperated sigh]

42:19.838 --> 42:21.072
I couldn't care less.

42:22.240 --> 42:23.842
God cares.

42:23.975 --> 42:25.877
- Ainsley, hold hands.
- [scoffs]

42:27.078 --> 42:28.814
So gross.

42:32.918 --> 42:35.020
[exhales]

42:36.054 --> 42:37.856
Lord, thank you for this day

42:37.956 --> 42:40.992
and thank you for bringing
my family back together.

42:41.092 --> 42:44.062
And thank you
for Dale and Neal--

42:44.195 --> 42:45.163
- Nathan. Nate.
- [laughs]

42:45.263 --> 42:46.431
[Angela]
Oh, shit.

42:46.564 --> 42:49.534
Sorry, Nathan. Nathan, God.

42:49.635 --> 42:50.702
Course you know his name

42:50.836 --> 42:52.638
'cause you're God,
but I didn't know it.

42:52.771 --> 42:54.773
I know it now.

42:54.906 --> 42:56.474
[sighs]

42:56.642 --> 42:59.210
Thank you for this food--

42:59.344 --> 43:02.547
which looks damn good,
if I do say so myself--

43:02.681 --> 43:04.115
I found a butcher
that imports wild boar

43:04.282 --> 43:06.517
from Italy,
if you can believe it.

43:06.618 --> 43:08.987
If you're gonna make a
Bolognese, it is by far the best

43:09.120 --> 43:11.022
to use wild boar
and not just ground pork.

43:11.122 --> 43:12.157
We still praying?

43:12.323 --> 43:14.626
I'm not sure. Maybe she forgot.

43:14.760 --> 43:16.962
[Angela] Help us to be mindful
of those less fortunate.

43:17.128 --> 43:21.532
Help us to celebrate you
by living our very best life.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.502
- Amen.
- [Ainsley] Amen.

43:24.670 --> 43:26.237
- [Dale and Nathan] Amen.
- Amen.

43:27.305 --> 43:29.207
Let's eat. [laughs]

43:29.307 --> 43:32.010
First time I've heard
blasphemy in a prayer.

43:32.177 --> 43:34.612
[Angela]
Pass me the wine.

43:34.746 --> 43:36.081
Okay.

43:36.214 --> 43:39.017
So, the food is Italian

43:39.150 --> 43:40.952
- and the wine is French.
- Mm.

43:41.086 --> 43:44.522
This is a Pomerol
from the Bordeaux region.

43:44.690 --> 43:46.825
It's a little wine-making
commune, isn't that cute?

43:46.958 --> 43:48.860
I'm gonna grab a beer.
Dale, you want one?

43:48.994 --> 43:49.995
- Thanks.
- All right.

43:50.128 --> 43:51.229
Beer?

43:51.329 --> 43:52.831
I can't drink wine.

43:52.964 --> 43:54.666
How come you can't drink wine?

43:54.800 --> 43:56.768
Because I'm an alcoholic.

43:56.902 --> 43:59.337
When did they stop fermenting
beer, Mr. Alcoholic?

43:59.470 --> 44:01.206
It's low-alcohol beer.

44:01.339 --> 44:03.008
If they start making
low-alcohol wine,

44:03.141 --> 44:05.043
I'll drink the shit out of it.

44:05.210 --> 44:06.411
You're no fun.

44:08.013 --> 44:09.848
Thank you.

44:09.981 --> 44:11.282
[clears throat]

44:11.416 --> 44:12.918
[blows nose]

44:16.587 --> 44:18.690
[coughs, clears throat]

44:18.824 --> 44:20.191
Mmm.

44:20.358 --> 44:21.727
Here you go, bud.

44:24.029 --> 44:25.764
[Angela clears throat]

44:29.034 --> 44:31.937
[sighs] Are you all better
from your explosion, honey?

44:33.304 --> 44:34.372
I'm fine.

44:35.741 --> 44:38.043
You know,
your sister's following

44:38.176 --> 44:41.146
in your footsteps, baby.
She's going to Tech.

44:41.279 --> 44:44.015
I'm sure all the sororities
are beside themselves with joy.

44:44.149 --> 44:45.550
Cooper, be nice.

44:45.717 --> 44:47.585
Or maybe just don't speak.

44:47.753 --> 44:48.553
For the rest of your life.

44:48.720 --> 44:50.555
[Tommy]
So, uh...

44:52.357 --> 44:54.225
What'd you say this stuff is?

44:54.392 --> 44:55.894
Bolognese.

44:56.061 --> 44:59.865
It's three types of meat--
veal, beef, and wild boar--

44:59.998 --> 45:01.499
- like I was telling God.
- [Dale] Mm.

45:01.632 --> 45:02.734
So, spaghetti.

45:02.868 --> 45:05.570
Not spaghetti. No.

45:05.703 --> 45:07.405
Spaghetti doesn't use
veal or pork

45:07.538 --> 45:10.508
and it doesn't use cream
and it doesn't use sugar.

45:10.608 --> 45:11.542
Is there sugar in this?

45:11.676 --> 45:14.012
Not enough to make a difference.

45:38.369 --> 45:39.838
[sighs]
How was your day, Nathan?

45:41.239 --> 45:42.107
My day?

45:42.240 --> 45:43.208
Mm-hmm.

45:43.308 --> 45:45.476
[laughs]

45:45.610 --> 45:47.212
Uh, I'm an attorney.

45:47.312 --> 45:48.713
Oh?

45:48.814 --> 45:50.816
Well, I can't...

45:50.982 --> 45:53.684
My day is governed
by attorney-client privilege.

45:53.785 --> 45:55.486
So you can't talk
about your day?

45:55.620 --> 45:57.122
No, ma'am.

45:57.288 --> 45:58.756
Mm-hmm.

46:00.892 --> 46:02.393
Dale.

46:02.527 --> 46:03.962
How was yours?

46:06.464 --> 46:08.033
'Bout a five, don't you think?

46:08.133 --> 46:10.235
Well, till the end of the day,
it was just about a two.

46:10.335 --> 46:12.303
What happened?

46:20.578 --> 46:22.747
You a fucking lawyer now, too?

46:22.881 --> 46:25.183
You want to hear about my day?

46:25.316 --> 46:27.118
All right, here it is.

46:27.252 --> 46:29.254
I stood out in
a hundred-degree heat all day

46:29.387 --> 46:32.057
staring at gauges
on fucking oil pumps,

46:32.157 --> 46:33.892
until some cartel members
showed up

46:33.992 --> 46:35.894
and demanded we pay 'em back

46:35.994 --> 46:38.796
for the drugs they lost
on our lease

46:38.930 --> 46:41.566
to the tune of about
$30 million dollars.

46:42.633 --> 46:44.669
Guess how they took it
when I said no.

46:45.871 --> 46:47.939
- That really happened?
- Yeah.

46:48.039 --> 46:49.507
Yeah. Yeah, it really happened.

46:49.640 --> 46:50.976
Does Monty know?

46:51.109 --> 46:52.377
I'm going over there tomorrow.

46:52.543 --> 46:54.745

47:03.321 --> 47:05.190
Well, let's see. What else?

47:08.860 --> 47:10.328
My hemorrhoid finally burst.

47:10.461 --> 47:12.130
[groans]

47:12.230 --> 47:14.866
It's amazing how 80 miles
of dirt road will

47:15.000 --> 47:17.002
work through
one of those pesky ones.

47:26.544 --> 47:28.213
Excuse me.

47:35.753 --> 47:37.055
[dishes clatter]

47:40.758 --> 47:42.093
Dad.

47:43.561 --> 47:44.362
What?

47:44.495 --> 47:46.965
Go talk to her. Say sorry.

47:47.865 --> 47:49.234
All right.

47:49.367 --> 47:50.902
[Ainsley]
Be nice.

47:54.339 --> 47:56.507
You don't think we're
doing this every night, do you?

47:56.641 --> 48:00.411
I don't know, but this fucking
spaghetti's pretty good, though.

48:05.150 --> 48:07.652
Didn't take you long
to ruin that dinner.

48:09.320 --> 48:10.888
[pot bangs against trash can]

48:11.022 --> 48:13.324
I spent all day

48:13.424 --> 48:17.028
shopping and decorating
and cooking for you.

48:17.162 --> 48:19.430
That's your three
favorite things to do, so

48:19.564 --> 48:22.233
I'm glad you did 'em, honey,
but if we have

48:22.367 --> 48:24.802
a mouse fart's chance in hell
of making this work,

48:24.936 --> 48:26.271
you got to remember
why we're here.

48:26.437 --> 48:28.073
[groans]

48:28.206 --> 48:30.108
We're here to work.

48:30.241 --> 48:31.909
Midland's not home to any of us.

48:32.043 --> 48:33.945
How long have you
been here, Tommy?

48:34.079 --> 48:35.346
Hmm?

48:36.881 --> 48:38.549
You know, let me answer for you.

48:38.683 --> 48:40.118
Thirty-three years.

48:41.152 --> 48:43.121
You may not like your home,
but this is it.

48:44.189 --> 48:47.392
And I need this to feel like
a home, if we're gonna be in it.

48:47.525 --> 48:51.229
All right, well, if you want
to put a hundred grand

48:51.329 --> 48:53.064
on your husband's credit card
to spruce the place up--

48:53.164 --> 48:54.465
Two hundred and twenty.

48:54.632 --> 48:56.767
Okay. Well, do it for you.

48:56.901 --> 48:59.270
Do it 'cause you like it.
You know, don't do it for us,

48:59.404 --> 49:01.839
and don't expect us
to appreciate it, or even care.

49:01.973 --> 49:04.409
I mean, if you want to cook,
be my guest,

49:04.509 --> 49:07.012
but don't expect us
to be here when it's ready.

49:07.145 --> 49:08.946
And don't expect us
to appreciate it.

49:09.080 --> 49:10.481
I mean, we do,

49:10.615 --> 49:12.483
but don't expect it.
See, that's the problem.

49:12.650 --> 49:14.819
You got this image in your brain

49:14.986 --> 49:16.421
of how everything's
supposed to go,

49:16.554 --> 49:20.858
but we don't know what that is,
you know? We don't see it.

49:20.992 --> 49:24.262
So, when it don't go the way
you dreamed it up,

49:24.362 --> 49:26.297
you get pissed off,
you throw a tantrum,

49:26.431 --> 49:29.167
and then I get pissed off,
throw a bigger tantrum,

49:29.300 --> 49:31.136
and then we're back
to square one.

49:33.971 --> 49:35.173
[sighs]

49:35.306 --> 49:37.275
Our children hate each other.

49:37.375 --> 49:38.343
Honey, they're teenagers.

49:38.509 --> 49:39.710
They're supposed to
hate each other.

49:39.844 --> 49:42.547
Cooper is not a teenager.

49:42.713 --> 49:44.182
He's a man.

49:44.315 --> 49:47.185
I mean, a man.
When the fuck did that happen?

49:48.653 --> 49:50.955
I mean, do I look like a woman

49:51.089 --> 49:53.224
with a 22-year-old?

49:54.892 --> 49:57.195
I'm turning into a GMILF.

49:57.328 --> 49:58.896
The hell's a GMILF?

49:59.030 --> 50:00.898
A grandmother I'd like to fuck.

50:01.032 --> 50:03.000
I'm aging out of cougar,
for fuck's sake.

50:03.134 --> 50:04.269
All right, well, listen, honey.

50:04.369 --> 50:06.304
Uh, let me ask you a question,
and when I do,

50:06.404 --> 50:07.438
please don't hit me, all right?

50:07.538 --> 50:09.440
What?

50:09.540 --> 50:12.510
At what point are we
in your menstrual cycle?

50:14.412 --> 50:16.013
Oh, you motherfucker,
don't you dare.

50:16.147 --> 50:17.148
Well, let me guess.

50:17.282 --> 50:19.184
I'm gonna say
right towards the end.

50:19.317 --> 50:21.086
You need to be real careful.

50:21.252 --> 50:22.220
Am I wrong?

50:22.387 --> 50:23.488
I am stone-ass serious
right now.

50:23.588 --> 50:25.390
Tell me the fucking truth,
am I wrong?

50:26.457 --> 50:27.925
[laughs] It's coming any minute.

50:28.093 --> 50:28.993
That's what I figured.
