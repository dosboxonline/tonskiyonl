WEBVTT

00:07.541 --> 00:09.083
- Brace yourselves!
- Disa!

00:11.500 --> 00:12.750
<i>A fire-mountain awoke.</i>

00:12.750 --> 00:14.333
<i>The ground-shakes...</i>

00:14.333 --> 00:16.583
<i>it spread through the bones of the Earth,</i>

00:16.583 --> 00:18.583
<i>collapsing our sun-shafts,</i>

00:18.583 --> 00:20.083
<i>our ability to grow crops.</i>

00:20.083 --> 00:21.333
No, no, no.

00:21.333 --> 00:24.250
These Rings will be
beyond any power yet devised

00:24.250 --> 00:26.458
by Dwarf, or Man.

00:27.083 --> 00:29.041
They shall be Rings of Power.

00:29.041 --> 00:31.041
<i>Power to heal your mountain.</i>

00:31.041 --> 00:33.791
Bringing your father
a means of saving his kingdom

00:33.916 --> 00:35.875
<i>might be just the way
to earn back his respect.</i>

00:35.875 --> 00:37.666
<i>Perhaps, even your inheritance.</i>

00:37.666 --> 00:39.625
Did you just insult my father?

00:39.625 --> 00:43.625
You speak ill of the Queen again,
it'll be you suffers an infirmity.

00:43.625 --> 00:45.375
Have I made myself plain?

00:46.291 --> 00:47.333
<i>Queen of lies!</i>

00:47.333 --> 00:48.541
<i>She's unfit to rule!</i>

00:48.541 --> 00:50.625
His dying words,
the King spoke to me,

00:50.625 --> 00:53.791
and said it was from this...
she took counsel.

00:53.791 --> 00:55.916
This Elf-stone is your queen!

00:55.916 --> 00:58.208
- Silence!
- The <i>palantír</i> is mine. We need it.

01:00.583 --> 01:02.125
<i>Murderer!</i>

01:02.125 --> 01:03.375
Dark magic!

01:06.333 --> 01:09.875
Pharazôn! Pharazôn! Pharazôn!

01:10.000 --> 01:12.333
Pharazôn! Pharazôn!

01:12.333 --> 01:15.541
Your High King believes the Dwarves
to be unworthy.

01:15.541 --> 01:18.541
In fact, he has forbidden
the forging of any more Rings at all.

01:18.541 --> 01:23.000
We have not the time to bandy words about,
convincing him who is worthy of aid.

01:23.000 --> 01:23.958
What are you doing?

01:23.958 --> 01:26.375
I am telling him
that I am closing up the forge.

01:26.375 --> 01:28.416
You would lie to your High King?

01:28.416 --> 01:30.791
I would grant us the space
to complete our work.

01:31.625 --> 01:35.125
This power in Eregion, I don't trust it.

01:35.125 --> 01:36.750
<i>You told me once,</i>

01:36.750 --> 01:40.375
<i>the fate of Elves is decided
by wiser minds than our own.</i>

01:40.375 --> 01:43.125
<i>That to try and alter it,
to try and cheat death,</i>

01:43.125 --> 01:45.708
<i>might lead to an even greater catastrophe.</i>

01:45.708 --> 01:47.708
<i>I keep wondering...</i>

01:47.708 --> 01:49.666
<i>What if you were right?</i>

01:49.666 --> 01:52.250
<i>A legion of Orcs
have marched into Elvish lands.</i>

01:52.250 --> 01:53.458
That trail.

01:53.458 --> 01:54.791
I gather it leads to--

01:54.791 --> 01:56.333
Eregion, my liege.

01:56.333 --> 01:59.666
Word of this must reach the High King
before our host sails for Mordor.

02:00.791 --> 02:02.208
Over there.

02:02.208 --> 02:04.958
<i>Get to Lindon.
I will occupy them as long as I am able.</i>

02:05.875 --> 02:07.083
<i>Take it.</i>

02:07.750 --> 02:09.166
<i>Take it, Elrond.</i>

02:20.083 --> 02:22.750
A star shines on the hour
of our meeting...

02:23.416 --> 02:25.125
Lady Galadriel.

04:54.666 --> 04:55.666
This way, sire.

04:55.666 --> 04:59.625
As you can see, we're attempting
to dig a new access-shaft,

04:59.625 --> 05:01.333
to try to reach the sunlight.

05:01.333 --> 05:06.958
Uh, but thus far, our every effort
has only made the mountain more unstable.

05:23.791 --> 05:24.916
Something the matter, sire?

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
No.

05:28.791 --> 05:31.833
No, all is shortly to be well.

05:32.875 --> 05:33.875
Yep.

06:10.958 --> 06:12.125
Dig here.

06:14.541 --> 06:17.916
Sire. That's a foundation wall.

06:17.916 --> 06:21.166
- Take it down--
- Are you explaining Delve-craft to me?

06:25.416 --> 06:28.583
This is where we are meant to dig.
Now do as I say.

06:36.083 --> 06:37.333
Give me your axe.

06:37.958 --> 06:39.583
- Father--
- Axe!

07:03.750 --> 07:04.750
Narvi!

07:04.750 --> 07:07.000
Uh... Shift's over!

07:07.500 --> 07:10.041
Go. Go!

07:10.041 --> 07:11.583
That's good.
Tell me twice.

07:29.125 --> 07:33.166
Sire. Don't you think
you'd better stop for some air?

07:34.333 --> 07:36.958
It's not air we need, it's light.

07:44.291 --> 07:45.291
Sire! Don't!

07:45.291 --> 07:46.208
Father, no!

08:05.625 --> 08:08.125
Next time I order you to dig,

08:10.125 --> 08:11.208
you do so.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.541
Here. Here.

08:26.083 --> 08:27.666
Right. One, two, three, four.

08:27.666 --> 08:29.500
<i>Pity those who dwell above.</i>

08:29.500 --> 08:30.958
<i>Slaves to the sun.</i>

08:35.166 --> 08:38.208
<i>Chained to its ceaseless rhythm
of waking and sleep.</i>

08:51.458 --> 08:55.250
<i>In Khazad-dûm, we are free of its tyranny.</i>

09:01.000 --> 09:05.875
Here, we bring the sun to us.

09:07.958 --> 09:12.916
At last, it is daybreak once more

09:12.916 --> 09:14.250
in our mountain!

09:19.291 --> 09:21.041
Khazad...

09:21.041 --> 09:22.750
Dûm!

09:26.458 --> 09:28.875
Dwarves and Elves
working together.

09:28.875 --> 09:31.208
It was said to be impossible.

09:31.208 --> 09:34.666
But our cooperation
has achieved this wonder.

09:34.666 --> 09:39.166
And today, we embark upon a new dream,

09:39.916 --> 09:42.791
to enshrine our friendship in stone.

09:45.625 --> 09:46.750
Narvi?

09:51.958 --> 09:53.583
Narvi's big moment.

09:55.875 --> 09:56.958
Behold...

10:02.208 --> 10:03.833
the Doors of Durin.

10:05.791 --> 10:08.625
The new West-gate of our mountain.

10:09.708 --> 10:12.833
Unbreachable. Visible only by moonlight.

10:13.500 --> 10:18.875
And guarded by a password,
known only to friends.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.125
Now, take note, smiths,

10:22.958 --> 10:25.750
watch Narvi very closely while he's here.

10:25.750 --> 10:28.083
Not only because he is a masterful artist.

10:28.083 --> 10:29.250
Mm...

10:29.250 --> 10:32.833
He's also a notorious thief.
Do not let any jewels go missing.

10:34.333 --> 10:37.166
Yeah, well,
try checking his pockets.

10:37.166 --> 10:39.208
Oh, no...

10:39.208 --> 10:41.000
To a lasting friendship...

10:41.833 --> 10:44.916
between Elves and Dwarves.

10:46.875 --> 10:49.416
Hospitality's much appreciated.

10:57.041 --> 11:00.083
Too much? My remarks.

11:00.708 --> 11:02.708
I encouraged you to keep it short.

11:04.500 --> 11:05.875
Oh...

11:05.875 --> 11:07.458
Do not recall you saying that.

11:09.208 --> 11:12.000
Well, you do not always listen.

11:13.541 --> 11:15.541
Once you have an idea set in your head.

11:19.916 --> 11:21.625
Truth is, I should've spoken longer.

11:23.625 --> 11:24.916
To credit your contributions.

11:28.458 --> 11:29.625
Forgive me.

11:31.875 --> 11:33.916
I find it difficult to stay festive,

11:35.041 --> 11:38.125
when those most affected
by Mordor's rise are still suffering.

11:41.375 --> 11:42.750
Rings for Men?

11:49.541 --> 11:51.500
I did not say anything about Rings.

11:52.291 --> 11:55.541
It is a game you play, is it not?

11:55.541 --> 11:59.125
Sowing seeds in others' minds
and then convincing them

11:59.125 --> 12:01.208
that the fruit is of their own thought.

12:01.208 --> 12:04.500
I thought our minds were as one in this.

12:07.166 --> 12:09.375
Have you had a change of heart?

12:09.375 --> 12:13.791
This is a night for Dwarves. Come.
We shall speak of Men tomorrow.

12:15.750 --> 12:17.833
I would prefer to speak of them now.

12:22.125 --> 12:24.541
Much of the misery of Men
is of their own making.

12:26.916 --> 12:29.500
And I have been informed
that it was the Men of the Southlands

12:29.500 --> 12:31.750
who aided Adar in his conquest
in the first place.

12:31.750 --> 12:32.833
Only some of them.

12:32.833 --> 12:35.291
Many of the rest have already
been given new homes,

12:36.416 --> 12:39.541
by their own kind, from Númenor.

12:40.375 --> 12:42.250
Have you ever been to Númenor?

12:42.250 --> 12:43.958
No.

12:45.208 --> 12:46.666
It is remarkable.

12:47.666 --> 12:48.958
But fractured.

12:50.166 --> 12:53.500
Ever teetering between glory and ruin.

12:55.166 --> 12:57.208
I fear Númenor.

12:58.416 --> 13:00.000
More than any land in Middle-earth.

13:02.416 --> 13:05.916
I had hoped our Rings
might make her stable.

13:07.208 --> 13:09.583
We cannot give Rings to Men.

13:10.208 --> 13:12.500
The risk of corruption
is simply too great.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.041
Whatever problems we might solve
will be nothing

13:15.041 --> 13:16.750
against those we could create.

13:16.750 --> 13:17.833
Yes.

13:18.708 --> 13:19.875
You are right.

13:20.958 --> 13:23.958
Of course.
Men are capable of great frailty.

13:26.875 --> 13:28.583
But when the darkness falls,

13:29.666 --> 13:34.666
there are always some
who rise forth and shine.

13:37.083 --> 13:40.208
Eärendil, Tuor,

13:41.333 --> 13:43.833
Beren, son of Barahir.

13:47.500 --> 13:48.916
Exactly what are you proposing?

13:51.125 --> 13:53.125
We find Men we can trust.

13:54.458 --> 13:58.291
The wisest, the most noble,
the purest of heart.

13:58.291 --> 14:02.750
From Númenor to Rhûn,
we identify nine Ring-bearers

14:02.750 --> 14:04.583
of the nine greatest mortal kingdoms.

14:04.583 --> 14:05.666
Nine?

14:08.125 --> 14:09.791
The perfection of the Three.

14:12.083 --> 14:13.541
Thrice perfected.

14:15.750 --> 14:20.333
For our third forging, we will make nine.

14:23.375 --> 14:28.416
We have accomplished great things,
my friend.

14:30.333 --> 14:33.833
Let us not tempt failure...

14:35.875 --> 14:39.541
by allowing our reach to exceed our grasp.

14:44.041 --> 14:47.041
I am sorry. My answer is no.

14:48.416 --> 14:50.916
The Rings of Power are complete.

14:52.125 --> 14:53.208
Of course.

14:56.333 --> 14:59.541
You need not apologize. Very well.

15:09.291 --> 15:11.500
I shall make the Nine myself.

15:21.125 --> 15:24.875
Have you ever seen it?
Across our western seas.

15:25.750 --> 15:27.791
The white tower of Eressëa...

15:27.791 --> 15:31.041
the very gateway to the Undying Lands.

15:31.875 --> 15:33.375
I have not.

15:34.083 --> 15:35.708
Only the keenest eye can.

15:37.458 --> 15:40.041
And only from the peak of the Meneltarma.

15:40.666 --> 15:42.958
I reckon the Elves
placed it there on purpose.

15:43.458 --> 15:48.083
So that every sunset serves as a reminder
that our days must end

15:49.083 --> 15:50.625
and theirs will not.

15:51.750 --> 15:54.500
That no matter how high we climb,

15:54.500 --> 15:58.083
some things will be forever withheld
from our grasp.

16:02.625 --> 16:05.375
The Scepter is now in yours, Father.

16:07.291 --> 16:08.833
Is that not high enough?

16:08.833 --> 16:12.333
All my life, I believed it was.

16:20.333 --> 16:23.000
The Scepter is what you make it.

16:23.000 --> 16:26.583
The Age of Men is upon us, Father.
Let us take it.

16:26.583 --> 16:30.291
Let us build the Númenor
you have always seen in your mind's eye.

16:40.250 --> 16:42.833
Once, when you were at her breast,

16:42.833 --> 16:47.875
your mother prophesied
that you would come to ill ends.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.208
My mother?

16:57.166 --> 16:58.791
What did she say?

16:58.791 --> 17:03.166
Impress me in the task
that I am about to place upon you

17:03.166 --> 17:04.375
and I will tell you.

17:04.500 --> 17:09.875
Fail to do so, and I shall have to find
other places to make use of you.

17:13.750 --> 17:20.083
Pharazôn! Pharazôn! Pharazôn!

17:20.708 --> 17:21.708
Listen to them.

17:22.541 --> 17:24.541
There are other voices
out there.

17:24.541 --> 17:26.625
Valandil tells me that in the Old Quarter,

17:26.625 --> 17:28.875
prayers ascend night and day for you.

17:30.041 --> 17:31.333
For their Queen.

17:33.375 --> 17:35.083
Our Queen.

17:35.083 --> 17:37.625
Command us all
and together we can put this right.

17:37.625 --> 17:39.708
- The Sea-Guard is still loyal to you.
- Elendil--

17:39.708 --> 17:41.958
- Together we can fight.
- Elendil.

17:53.958 --> 17:58.250
It was you, who opened my heart again
to the way of The Faithful.

17:59.333 --> 18:01.250
We swore to keep serving.

18:01.250 --> 18:02.583
Now, you wish to be still...

18:03.416 --> 18:05.416
while the wolves are licking the cradle?

18:06.833 --> 18:10.000
What did you see? In the <i>palantír.</i>

18:17.416 --> 18:18.541
<i>I saw myself.</i>

18:21.208 --> 18:22.291
<i>Lost.</i>

18:24.125 --> 18:25.541
<i>Riding from the city to...</i>

18:31.250 --> 18:32.250
I know not where.

18:32.916 --> 18:35.125
Then you did not see it.

18:36.041 --> 18:38.166
- See what?
- Perhaps it's changed.

18:38.791 --> 18:40.000
What do you mean?

18:41.416 --> 18:43.791
Not every battle must be fought to be won.

18:43.791 --> 18:47.416
Sometimes maintaining stillness of heart
is the greatest victory of all,

18:47.416 --> 18:50.458
the greatest act of faith one can perform.

18:50.458 --> 18:51.958
I don't understand.

18:54.375 --> 18:57.958
For years, that <i>palantír</i>

18:57.958 --> 19:00.541
has shown me only our island's downfall.

19:00.541 --> 19:03.541
But when you touched it,
that vision was gone.

19:03.541 --> 19:05.500
Changed to a new path.

19:06.166 --> 19:09.666
Pharazôn's kingship
is a part of that path.

19:09.666 --> 19:11.958
And so are you.

19:11.958 --> 19:14.458
You have asked for my command.

19:17.458 --> 19:18.708
Now it is given.

19:27.291 --> 19:31.000
No matter how hard they push you,
no matter what they try and take,

19:31.000 --> 19:34.250
you must not jeopardize
Númenor's new destiny.

19:35.083 --> 19:38.500
You must remain the calm
at the storm's eye.

19:39.166 --> 19:41.416
Go back to your ship, Captain.

19:48.750 --> 19:50.375
You render it willingly?

19:50.375 --> 19:51.291
I do.

19:51.291 --> 19:53.458
You're no longer
a Sea-Guard. Next.

19:55.583 --> 19:56.583
Line up.

19:57.083 --> 19:58.250
Lieutenant.

19:58.250 --> 19:59.416
All right. This way.

20:04.416 --> 20:06.000
What's the meaning of all this?

20:06.791 --> 20:11.041
Anyone deemed loyal to the Queen-regent
has been stripped of rank.

20:11.041 --> 20:12.541
On whose authority?

20:12.541 --> 20:13.833
On mine.

20:18.125 --> 20:19.916
I'm sorry. I'd hoped to tell you earlier.

20:19.916 --> 20:23.250
Lord Belzagar wanted the lot of you
charged with treason.

20:24.208 --> 20:28.291
And yet, overthrowing a queen
has earned you a promotion.

20:28.291 --> 20:30.958
How dare you reduce my grief
to petty ambition?

20:31.708 --> 20:35.083
My brother is dead because Míriel peeped
into an Elf-stone.

20:35.083 --> 20:37.666
You mock that which is sacred.

20:37.666 --> 20:40.083
I mock that which is absurd.

20:40.083 --> 20:41.541
Ar-Pharazôn is your king.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.833
Accept it, Father. I beg you.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.583
You are walking a treacherous path.

20:48.916 --> 20:50.958
And yours is made of seawater.

20:50.958 --> 20:54.666
Take care to keep your feet beneath you,
it's a long way to the bottom.

20:59.750 --> 21:01.750
Are you ready?
Is everything there?

21:01.750 --> 21:03.208
Yes.
Next.

21:04.250 --> 21:06.750
It's all there. This is all from the same.
Check him up, now.

21:14.375 --> 21:15.583
Captain leaving deck!

21:18.041 --> 21:19.625
He's nobody's captain now.

21:40.333 --> 21:41.333
He's right.

21:48.375 --> 21:49.375
I'm not.

21:54.875 --> 21:55.875
Captain.

22:00.875 --> 22:02.583
- Thank you, Captain.
- The Valar protect you.

22:02.583 --> 22:03.500
That's enough.

22:03.500 --> 22:05.541
Thank you, Captain.
Thank you, Captain.

22:05.541 --> 22:07.750
Valar bless you, Captain.
Captain, thank you, sir.

22:07.750 --> 22:09.208
Valar bless you.
Thank you, sir.

22:09.208 --> 22:10.666
Thank you, Captain.

22:11.750 --> 22:13.000
That's enough.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
Thank you, Captain.
Thank you, Captain.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.083
How do you think this ends? Silence!

22:17.083 --> 22:20.625
Thank you, Captain. Thank you.
Bless you, Captain. Bless you.

22:22.416 --> 22:25.000
Captain, Elendil.
Valar bless you.

22:26.416 --> 22:27.416
Valandil.

22:28.125 --> 22:30.250
Perhaps I can have you taken off the list.

22:31.250 --> 22:32.375
I'll speak to the king.

22:33.500 --> 22:34.750
You would do that for me?

22:37.833 --> 22:39.583
You're one of my oldest friends.

22:40.458 --> 22:44.625
I think you've made it clear enough
who your friends are.

23:33.000 --> 23:35.125
<i>Most noble High King.</i>

23:35.125 --> 23:38.166
<i>I write this letter to convey my deep joy</i>

23:38.166 --> 23:41.833
<i>on hearing of the success
of the Three Rings in Lindon.</i>

23:42.791 --> 23:48.125
<i>As requested, the forge is dark
and the workshop is empty.</i>

23:48.791 --> 23:54.041
<i>A precious calm has settled over the city,
and I foresee brighter days ahead.</i>

23:54.583 --> 23:57.375
<i>I hope you are able to make a visit soon.</i>

23:57.375 --> 24:00.916
<i>Until then, I remain as ever,</i>

24:00.916 --> 24:04.875
<i>your loyal servant, Lord Celebrimbor.</i>

24:09.916 --> 24:11.916
Our armada is ready to depart.

24:11.916 --> 24:13.041
What are we waiting for?

24:13.041 --> 24:15.208
All is well in Eregion.

24:15.208 --> 24:17.708
The letter proves Galadriel was wrong.

24:17.708 --> 24:22.083
And whilst we hesitate,
Adar's army grows stronger by the day.

24:22.625 --> 24:25.375
If we are to invade, we must leave now.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.416
Our enemy is in Mordor.

24:42.458 --> 24:45.291
Are you truly prepared to wager
the future of Middle-earth

24:45.291 --> 24:47.833
on the whispers of that Ring alone?

24:57.333 --> 24:59.333
You pushed for this.
I know.

25:00.250 --> 25:03.333
- From the beginning.
- I know. I did. I know.

25:05.000 --> 25:09.166
But learning to hear
the mountain's a gift from Aulë,

25:09.166 --> 25:12.875
one that's honed
and refined over a lifetime.

25:13.958 --> 25:14.833
And this it...

25:17.500 --> 25:19.000
It feels somehow like cheating.

25:19.708 --> 25:21.041
Yeah, he's Durin the Third.

25:21.958 --> 25:24.583
I think he knows a thing or two
about wielding power.

25:25.083 --> 25:29.208
That kind of power would test
even the most virtuous of Dwarves.

25:29.208 --> 25:31.291
I pray your father keeps his path true.

25:43.291 --> 25:45.708
Oh! It's perfect.

25:45.708 --> 25:46.625
Mmm-hmm.

25:47.458 --> 25:49.125
Two hundred for that one.

25:49.125 --> 25:51.083
Two hundred? For a bloody rock?

25:51.083 --> 25:53.166
It's a tuning crystal.

25:53.166 --> 25:56.916
I don't care if it's a cart
and six horses. I won't pay it.

25:56.916 --> 25:58.750
Ah, blame the king's new law.

25:58.750 --> 26:01.875
For every coin spent,
another goes to the crown.

26:01.875 --> 26:03.708
Ring tribute, he calls it.

26:05.000 --> 26:06.375
Ring tribute?

26:06.875 --> 26:10.166
Sir, this is for our wee girl's birthday
next week.

26:10.166 --> 26:13.041
Spare a bit for her sake?
We'll give you 100.

26:13.041 --> 26:15.291
- One hundred?
- One hundred.

26:16.375 --> 26:17.375
How's that sound?

26:17.375 --> 26:19.666
Like mine shaft robbery.

26:26.041 --> 26:27.250
Mmm!

26:27.250 --> 26:28.291
Hundred and fifty?

26:35.500 --> 26:36.583
Oh!

26:36.583 --> 26:38.708
Careful.
- Aulë's beard, excuse me.

26:38.708 --> 26:40.500
It's rollin'. It's rollin'.

26:42.625 --> 26:44.333
You seem to have kicked it.

26:45.208 --> 26:47.541
Madam, I'm so sorry
to get in your way.

26:48.208 --> 26:51.833
I have it, I have it, I have it.
Oof! No, I don't.

27:13.083 --> 27:14.083
Now then...

27:14.708 --> 27:16.291
Where are you, you little...

27:21.041 --> 27:21.916
Oh!

27:24.083 --> 27:25.083
What?

27:26.250 --> 27:27.958
What is this?

27:49.666 --> 27:51.250
There you are.

27:57.416 --> 27:58.541
Hmm.

28:24.208 --> 28:27.500
Emissaries of the seven Dwarven realms,

28:28.416 --> 28:32.750
I have gathered you all here today
because Middle-earth is changing.

28:34.666 --> 28:36.333
Its limbs are stretching.

28:37.125 --> 28:39.583
Its bones, creaking.

28:41.458 --> 28:45.500
Some dark will
threatens all our kingdoms.

28:48.291 --> 28:53.000
But by Aulë's favor,
my people have passed this test.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.375
And soon, yours shall pass it too.

28:58.333 --> 29:01.333
And rise together
into a new age for our kind

29:04.750 --> 29:07.666
with the help of a power
that will change everything.

29:10.708 --> 29:12.166
Seven Rings.

29:14.083 --> 29:15.583
Seven lords.

29:17.333 --> 29:22.041
And bound within each... power.

29:24.166 --> 29:25.625
Power over earth.

29:27.083 --> 29:28.083
Power over rock.

29:29.166 --> 29:32.208
Power to shape the destinies
of all Dwarves forever.

29:35.166 --> 29:38.583
The Rings are not for you,
but for your masters.

29:38.583 --> 29:43.208
Go back and tell them that each
of your realms may share in this bounty.

29:45.833 --> 29:47.416
But it comes with a price.

29:58.875 --> 30:01.083
<i>Khazad-dûm
shall never want again.</i>

30:03.916 --> 30:06.333
<i>There is gold right beneath us.</i>

30:10.833 --> 30:13.500
We should be delving much deeper.

30:13.500 --> 30:16.208
But who set these restrictions?

30:16.208 --> 30:19.500
Well, you did, sire. Decades ago.

30:20.958 --> 30:22.041
Then strike them.

30:22.750 --> 30:23.791
Strike... But, sire--

30:23.791 --> 30:27.500
Strike them, Delve-master,
or I'll find them...

30:30.916 --> 30:32.666
- Where is it?
- You took it off.

30:32.666 --> 30:34.458
Where is it? What have you done with it?

30:34.458 --> 30:37.375
It's there, sire. You-- You took it off.

30:38.083 --> 30:41.916
You said your hand was feeling heavy.

30:44.125 --> 30:44.958
Oh...

30:46.250 --> 30:47.083
Hmm.

30:47.875 --> 30:50.458
It was. It was.

31:05.875 --> 31:08.291
Start to dig, points
where I've marked.

31:09.625 --> 31:10.625
Sire.

31:15.250 --> 31:16.250
Stop!

31:21.750 --> 31:23.208
There's something under the mines.

31:23.208 --> 31:25.375
Disa heard it herself.

31:25.375 --> 31:29.458
A nameless evil, ancient and powerful.

31:30.625 --> 31:32.500
You mustn't dig.

31:36.750 --> 31:38.916
You have your orders, Delve-master.

31:40.583 --> 31:42.000
Narvi, I beg you.

31:43.958 --> 31:46.958
Delve-master. You have your orders.

31:58.583 --> 32:02.333
Stone-singers speak
of hearing the mountain.

32:03.625 --> 32:08.791
- What?
- With this Ring, I can see it.

32:11.041 --> 32:15.333
Every shaft, every ore, every jewel.

32:15.333 --> 32:17.750
In thousands of years,

32:18.541 --> 32:23.541
we have barely taken a thimble
from the ocean of her riches.

32:24.416 --> 32:26.208
Disa is mistaken.

32:29.625 --> 32:31.041
There is no danger.

32:42.458 --> 32:43.541
My lord.

32:44.875 --> 32:45.875
Are you hurt?

32:50.666 --> 32:51.833
Are you all right?

33:16.500 --> 33:18.125
Do my eyes deceive me?

33:21.458 --> 33:22.458
No.

33:23.333 --> 33:25.500
We were casting a new design for a Ring.

33:26.041 --> 33:28.833
Mirdania was attempting
to resize it when...

33:33.875 --> 33:35.083
Where is she?

33:38.666 --> 33:40.458
Look out!
Master!

33:45.541 --> 33:46.541
Get back!

33:58.666 --> 33:59.750
Stop.

34:02.000 --> 34:03.166
Breathe.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.250
What happened?

34:10.250 --> 34:13.541
I was in a place like this,

34:13.666 --> 34:19.666
but shrouded in mist and darkness, and...

34:20.208 --> 34:21.875
I saw-- I--

34:24.041 --> 34:27.083
At first,
I thought it was the forge burning.

34:30.875 --> 34:32.125
But it wasn't.

34:32.708 --> 34:33.708
What was it?

34:35.000 --> 34:36.833
It was tall...

34:38.458 --> 34:41.458
and its skin was made of flames.

34:44.333 --> 34:50.083
It came toward me, breathing,
reeking of death,

34:50.083 --> 34:52.083
and I saw... I--

34:53.125 --> 34:54.750
I saw its eyes.

34:56.333 --> 34:58.958
Pitiless and eternal.

34:59.666 --> 35:01.083
I think it's been here.

35:02.250 --> 35:04.666
I think it's been here among us,
all along!

35:04.666 --> 35:06.250
You are with us now.

35:07.666 --> 35:09.333
There is nothing to fear.

35:11.958 --> 35:13.458
Look around.

35:15.666 --> 35:16.916
All is well.

35:20.208 --> 35:24.208
What did you do differently this time?

35:26.958 --> 35:32.375
The Lord of Gifts shared your worry
that Men are too corruptible.

35:33.333 --> 35:36.333
So, we sought to fortify the alloy
by adding more <i>mithril.</i>

35:36.333 --> 35:37.666
No, no!

35:37.666 --> 35:39.916
If you'd wanted to do that,
you should've...

35:41.958 --> 35:43.208
You...

35:47.791 --> 35:50.250
It would save us
immeasurable hours of toil

35:50.250 --> 35:55.166
if you would offer
this one, single word of counsel.

36:07.916 --> 36:09.416
- My lord, Celebrimbor.
- You should--

36:11.125 --> 36:14.791
Forgive me, my lord, but Durin the Younger
is arrived from Khazad-dûm.

36:14.791 --> 36:16.083
No, tell him to wait.

36:17.000 --> 36:21.041
He says it is urgent.
Something about the Rings.

36:23.250 --> 36:24.666
I will see what he wants.

36:24.666 --> 36:25.833
No.

36:27.416 --> 36:29.750
No. I will go.

36:40.083 --> 36:41.208
How do you mean "changed"?

36:41.208 --> 36:45.083
It's like he's colder. Quicker to anger.

36:45.083 --> 36:48.041
Now they tell me,
he refuses to share the other Rings

36:48.041 --> 36:52.833
unless the Dwarf-lords promise him
half a share of their mines!

36:52.833 --> 36:55.833
Now, greed is not his way.
It never has been.

36:56.666 --> 36:57.708
I--

37:02.083 --> 37:05.208
Is it possible the Ring he's wearing--

37:05.208 --> 37:06.583
No.

37:08.166 --> 37:10.625
We used the same process, Durin,

37:10.625 --> 37:13.625
the same materials,
even the same tools as for the Three.

37:14.875 --> 37:19.416
Now, there simply cannot be a fault
in your Rings.

37:22.416 --> 37:25.000
Then maybe, the fault's in the Ring-maker.

37:26.416 --> 37:27.583
What do you mean?

37:27.583 --> 37:31.416
How much do you really know
about this Annatar?

37:46.791 --> 37:48.208
You are very brave.

37:49.458 --> 37:54.833
Some who behold the Unseen world
are never quite at home in this one again.

37:57.041 --> 37:58.708
Have you seen it?

37:58.708 --> 38:00.250
Yes.

38:01.875 --> 38:05.958
In its light,
things appear as they truly are.

38:07.375 --> 38:11.000
Beings of differing shades of light...

38:13.916 --> 38:15.291
And its darkness.

38:18.375 --> 38:20.083
It pains me to say,

38:21.208 --> 38:23.583
for what you saw,
I did not wish for any of you to see

38:25.041 --> 38:26.875
until I had helped him to heal.

38:29.291 --> 38:34.875
You... You speak of... Lord Celebrimbor?

38:35.750 --> 38:36.958
Yes.

38:39.250 --> 38:41.166
The toll that creation
has exacted from him

38:41.166 --> 38:45.833
in crafting the Three and the Seven
has left him diminished.

38:46.708 --> 38:48.291
Vulnerable to the shadow.

38:52.541 --> 38:54.125
Then, what I saw...

38:55.458 --> 38:57.583
Promise me you'll speak
to none other of it.

38:58.500 --> 38:59.875
Including him.

38:59.875 --> 39:01.125
I promise.

39:07.458 --> 39:08.791
How strange.

39:09.500 --> 39:12.500
When the light caught your hair,

39:14.291 --> 39:16.291
for a moment,
you seemed her perfect likeness.

39:17.708 --> 39:19.041
Whose likeness?

39:20.500 --> 39:22.166
Why, Lady Galadriel's, of course.

39:41.000 --> 39:45.583
The souls of those
we have lost yearn for peace.

39:45.583 --> 39:49.083
Tonight, we will help them to find it.

39:49.958 --> 39:54.166
Until we meet again
in the far green country

39:54.166 --> 39:56.583
under a swift sunrise.

40:43.500 --> 40:47.000
This shrine is condemned
by order of the king.

40:47.916 --> 40:49.166
Return to your homes.

40:49.166 --> 40:51.625
My son, this is the oldest shrine
in Númenor.

40:51.625 --> 40:53.375
It's in the way of the new aqueduct.

40:54.083 --> 40:56.416
Leave willingly or leave by force.

40:56.416 --> 40:58.375
The King sends his apologies.

41:07.833 --> 41:10.458
How's it feel to have a daughter
who's ashamed of you?

41:15.625 --> 41:18.083
You heard him, old man. Out!

41:21.333 --> 41:22.791
Get his arms.

41:22.791 --> 41:24.291
Wait. Wait!

41:26.333 --> 41:27.625
I'll escort him out.

41:29.791 --> 41:34.208
If she is not stored,
the souls for whom she weeps will be lost.

41:36.958 --> 41:38.041
Give him the relic.

41:42.416 --> 41:43.750
Give it to him, boy.

42:02.333 --> 42:04.916
I don't know if you're aware,
but I've been promoted to--

42:15.791 --> 42:17.041
Hold him.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.708
This shrine is for The Faithful.
King's men aren't welcome here.

42:31.708 --> 42:33.458
I don't see you praying.

42:36.916 --> 42:38.916
- May the Valar forgive me.
- For what?

42:39.958 --> 42:41.375
No! No!

42:49.916 --> 42:50.916
Valandil!

43:03.291 --> 43:05.166
No! Valandil!

43:23.583 --> 43:24.583
No!

43:43.083 --> 43:46.000
No! Valandil, put it down!

43:53.375 --> 43:54.458
Put it down, son.

43:57.375 --> 43:59.041
That's an order.

44:23.625 --> 44:24.708
Aye, Captain.

44:28.583 --> 44:29.583
No.

44:41.750 --> 44:43.416
No, no, no, no, no.

44:53.208 --> 44:54.208
No.

45:32.166 --> 45:37.125
Inform the jailer he was the one
who started the uprising.

45:45.250 --> 45:46.083
No!

45:46.083 --> 45:50.125
No, I tell you there is something
wrong with the Dwarven Rings!

45:50.125 --> 45:53.666
Or King Durin is misusing his Ring
and seeking to deflect blame.

45:53.666 --> 45:54.750
No!

45:55.458 --> 45:57.041
No, I do not believe that.

45:57.041 --> 46:00.000
As one who so masterfully
manipulates metals,

46:00.666 --> 46:03.291
just be mindful someone
is not manipulating you.

46:04.125 --> 46:05.875
You see daggers where there are none.

46:05.875 --> 46:09.250
And you ignore them,
until they are right at your throat.

46:09.250 --> 46:11.000
No. Enough.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.500
Did you...

46:15.000 --> 46:16.333
in some way...

46:18.291 --> 46:20.291
alter the Dwarven Rings, yes or no?

46:25.541 --> 46:26.625
No.

46:46.958 --> 46:47.958
We did.

46:49.833 --> 46:51.458
What are you talking about?

46:52.833 --> 46:57.250
These are matters of spirit,
as much as craft.

46:58.375 --> 47:01.458
And this time,
we brought deceit into the process.

47:01.458 --> 47:02.875
Deceit?

47:04.916 --> 47:06.458
What deceit could you poss--

47:09.833 --> 47:11.041
The letter.

47:14.625 --> 47:15.625
No.

47:17.458 --> 47:19.333
No, that, that was...

47:20.333 --> 47:21.541
You lied.

47:24.291 --> 47:26.000
That was not a lie. I--

47:26.000 --> 47:28.333
Your High King consented to the Three.

47:29.333 --> 47:34.000
But the Seven we forged
beneath a cloak of deception.

47:34.000 --> 47:35.666
You must go to Lindon forthwith,

47:36.541 --> 47:38.416
and confess the truth to your High King.

47:38.416 --> 47:40.083
Or matters will worsen.

47:40.083 --> 47:41.750
No, do that, he would...

47:43.916 --> 47:46.416
He would never permit me
to forge anything again.

47:47.458 --> 47:49.083
It is either that,

47:51.125 --> 47:52.875
or we plunge straight on...

47:55.541 --> 47:57.291
even deeper into the maelstrom.

48:01.250 --> 48:04.291
<i>Father,
I have been to Eregion.</i>

48:04.291 --> 48:09.416
I tell you, some devilry
has gone into these Rings.

48:09.416 --> 48:12.500
We mustn't use them anymore.

48:13.000 --> 48:18.625
Time and pressure can shape a Dwarf,

48:18.625 --> 48:21.375
as surely as it can shape a stone.

48:23.750 --> 48:28.083
I had hoped our estrangement
would help shape you, my son.

48:28.083 --> 48:32.916
But I did not expect
how much it would shape me.

48:32.916 --> 48:34.666
- Father--
- I am proud of you.

48:34.666 --> 48:36.416
- No.
- I am proud of you.

48:37.833 --> 48:43.291
Your desire to partner with the Elves
has saved our kingdom.

48:44.708 --> 48:48.375
That is why now, now, more than ever,

48:49.750 --> 48:51.375
I need you.

48:52.375 --> 48:55.458
I need your axe, by my side.

49:04.083 --> 49:05.083
Prince Durin.

49:28.083 --> 49:29.375
Durin?

49:30.375 --> 49:33.000
Durin, what did he say? Did he--

49:39.125 --> 49:40.125
I tried.

49:40.125 --> 49:42.708
But-- Durin, no.

49:42.708 --> 49:44.458
I tried to tell him.

49:46.958 --> 49:48.000
Durin...

49:58.666 --> 49:59.666
Swear it.

50:02.250 --> 50:06.458
Swear to me that you
will never wear one of those Rings.

50:15.750 --> 50:17.083
I swear it.

50:23.916 --> 50:28.375
<i>There is agency uncanny
in the heart of stone and ore.</i>

50:30.041 --> 50:33.291
Even when a work is yet
within the artist's bosom, it begins to...

50:36.333 --> 50:37.333
disobey him.

50:39.875 --> 50:42.500
We have failed. Every one of us.

50:43.041 --> 50:47.750
The designs were carried out
to the most exacting detail, my lord.

50:47.750 --> 50:49.125
Were they?

50:50.458 --> 50:53.833
Every last hammer stroke
done to perfection?

50:53.833 --> 50:59.250
Or did, did hubris and sloth come together
to dull your attention?

51:02.125 --> 51:06.291
We must atone for our mistakes
in the only way we can,

51:06.291 --> 51:11.041
by completing the Rings together.

51:13.625 --> 51:17.083
The Nine must do far more
than bring aid to Men,

51:17.083 --> 51:20.208
they must bring balance
to the entire project.

51:20.208 --> 51:24.000
They must draw strength from the Three.

51:24.625 --> 51:25.875
And somehow...

51:28.291 --> 51:29.958
redeem the Seven.

51:32.958 --> 51:36.000
They must redeem us all.

51:39.208 --> 51:41.583
We shall work night and day.

51:43.166 --> 51:47.625
New designs. New alloys. A new process.

51:48.625 --> 51:50.333
I will be with you at every turn.

51:50.333 --> 51:54.750
And any of you who offers so much
as a hair's breadth less

51:54.750 --> 51:58.166
than his utmost effort is a s--

51:58.166 --> 52:00.375
A smith of Eregion no longer.

52:03.458 --> 52:05.000
Have I made myself plain?

52:05.000 --> 52:06.791
Yes, yes, my lord.

52:07.541 --> 52:08.625
It starts now.

52:14.666 --> 52:16.291
What has gotten into him?

52:18.250 --> 52:21.916
My friends. Do not be discouraged.

52:24.291 --> 52:28.166
Your master may seem unreasonable.

52:29.833 --> 52:34.208
His demands intemperate,
or even impossible.

52:36.000 --> 52:39.416
But that is simply because he knows
how much depends on your success.

52:40.375 --> 52:42.916
Yet, I know you will not disappoint him.

52:47.041 --> 52:48.250
Or me.

52:52.208 --> 52:54.875
I, for one, am certain

52:56.250 --> 52:58.375
that we will complete the Rings of Power.

52:58.375 --> 52:59.458
Yes.

53:04.750 --> 53:05.958
Shall we begin?

53:05.958 --> 53:07.458
Yes, of course, my lord.

53:08.791 --> 53:09.791
Lord of Gifts indeed.

53:12.541 --> 53:13.625
Let's get to it.

53:58.875 --> 54:00.083
High King!

54:01.583 --> 54:04.583
High King, the Orcs are not in Mordor.

54:05.083 --> 54:07.333
A legion of them are headed for Eregion.

54:07.833 --> 54:09.041
Galadriel was right.

54:09.041 --> 54:12.125
You must send the army to Eregion
this moment.

54:13.375 --> 54:15.041
That will not be possible.

54:15.541 --> 54:21.250
I have reason to believe
that Sauron is the architect of all this.

54:22.166 --> 54:26.250
High King, Eregion is the very jewel
of Elvendom.

54:26.250 --> 54:29.416
If it were to fall, it would be
a mortal blow for all in Middle-earth.

54:29.416 --> 54:31.208
You must send aid!

54:32.208 --> 54:36.333
Our armies cannot defeat
both Adar and Sauron.

54:36.333 --> 54:37.666
Not alone.

54:40.750 --> 54:44.083
Come on! Come on!

54:58.000 --> 54:59.208
Back away!

55:26.833 --> 55:27.833
Get her out.

55:30.125 --> 55:32.291
Look out for her.
It's okay.

55:32.291 --> 55:33.666
Yeah.

55:51.916 --> 55:53.125
I brought you here

55:54.125 --> 55:55.208
not as a prisoner...

55:55.958 --> 55:57.083
But as a potential ally.

55:58.791 --> 56:00.666
For we share a common enemy.
