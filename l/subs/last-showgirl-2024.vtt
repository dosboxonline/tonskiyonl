WEBVTT

00:48.222 --> 00:49.658
<i>What's your name?</i>

00:50.441 --> 00:51.747
- Shelly Gardner.
- <i>Just need the first.</i>

00:51.921 --> 00:53.140
Oh, sorry.

00:53.314 --> 00:55.055
<i>How tall are you?</i>

00:56.708 --> 00:58.710
- 5'7".
- <i>Age?</i>

00:59.537 --> 01:03.106
Oh, a gentleman never asks
a lady her age.

01:03.280 --> 01:04.455
36?

01:05.500 --> 01:07.110
Sorry, I lied.

01:07.284 --> 01:08.938
I'm 42.

01:09.112 --> 01:10.635
But this house is huge.

01:10.809 --> 01:12.855
I mean, distance helps.

01:14.378 --> 01:15.466
- <i>Oh.</i>
- Oh, gosh, I'm sorry.

01:15.640 --> 01:16.641
I'm so nervous.

01:16.815 --> 01:17.642
I've been on the Razzle-Dazzle

01:17.816 --> 01:19.383
for so very long and...

01:20.297 --> 01:23.518
I just
haven't auditioned in a while.

01:24.562 --> 01:25.607
But it's exciting.

01:25.781 --> 01:26.999
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:27.174 --> 01:29.089
<i>You have an act prepared?</i>

01:29.263 --> 01:32.396
I do. I'm a dancer.

01:32.570 --> 01:34.181
<i>Music?</i>

01:34.355 --> 01:35.530
Yeah.

01:35.704 --> 01:37.488
I gave it to the maestro.

01:38.620 --> 01:40.274
<i>Okay.</i>

01:40.448 --> 01:41.753
Okay.

02:12.393 --> 02:14.525
Did someone raid a cemetery
for this fuckin' audience?

02:14.699 --> 02:16.310
Oh, shh.

02:17.920 --> 02:19.051
- Oh!
- Oh, shit!

02:19.226 --> 02:20.444
- Go!
- Did that just rip?

02:20.618 --> 02:22.577
- Shit.
- Go, go, go, go, go!

02:22.751 --> 02:24.709
When did they install
that new door handle?

02:24.883 --> 02:26.189
- Like, three months ago.
- Oh, God,

02:26.363 --> 02:27.582
that thing is asking
for ripped costumes.

02:27.756 --> 02:28.713
Are you sure?
Is it really ripped?

02:28.887 --> 02:29.845
Yeah, it's ripped.

02:30.019 --> 02:31.238
I have, like, 20/20 vision.

02:31.412 --> 02:33.370
Good for fuckin' you, Jodie.

02:37.069 --> 02:39.115
Okay. Yeah, bye.

02:39.289 --> 02:40.638
That's good as wow!

02:50.170 --> 02:51.736
I caught my wing
on that door handle!

02:51.910 --> 02:53.477
It's a trap.
They're so desperate for money,

02:53.651 --> 02:55.566
they're tryin' to squeeze it
back out of us.

02:55.740 --> 02:57.177
Paranoid.

02:57.351 --> 02:59.091
Oh, God, but you know,
they have to change that.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.093
I mean,
look at this gaping hole.

03:01.268 --> 03:02.878
Okay, let's keep it movin',
Shelly.

03:03.052 --> 03:05.620
I will, I just--look at that.

03:05.794 --> 03:07.317
Oh, gosh.

03:08.318 --> 03:11.191
I mean, I love that darn wing.

03:11.365 --> 03:13.802
You know, of all the wings
in the entire show,

03:13.976 --> 03:15.238
that's the oldest wing.

03:15.412 --> 03:17.675
- Ida is gonna kill me.
- Oh, whatever.

03:17.849 --> 03:19.982
That old Russian bitch has
hated me for, like, nine years.

03:20.156 --> 03:22.376
Because you keep losing
rhinestones and feathers.

03:22.550 --> 03:24.465
Oh, I'm not tryin'
to be a klutz out there, Jesus.

03:24.639 --> 03:26.858
I'm tryin' fuckin' dancing.
Like, what am I supposed to do?

03:27.032 --> 03:28.338
I am dancing.

03:28.512 --> 03:29.774
It's just so disappointing,
you know.

03:29.948 --> 03:31.602
Lemons, and now this.

03:31.776 --> 03:33.387
Lemons?

03:33.561 --> 03:35.171
They've just recently
been so expensive.

03:35.345 --> 03:37.260
Clip-ons, Shelly.
Clip-ons?

03:37.434 --> 03:38.740
Okay, can you please
put them on?

03:38.914 --> 03:40.045
Okay, well, I am. I mean,

03:40.220 --> 03:41.525
gosh, they're 89 cents apiece.

03:41.699 --> 03:42.918
You know,
lemons are not even really food,

03:43.092 --> 03:44.224
you know,
they're like a garnish.

03:44.398 --> 03:45.312
They're more like herbs.

03:45.486 --> 03:46.748
They're like accessories.

03:46.922 --> 03:48.053
- Who needs lemons?
- Let's go!

03:48.228 --> 03:49.272
Okay. Okay, okay.

03:49.446 --> 03:51.405
Let's go!

03:52.275 --> 03:53.755
The music's about to change.

03:53.929 --> 03:55.322
Well, I'm buying some nice
salmon steaks for dinner

03:55.496 --> 03:56.714
because I'm entertaining
tomorrow evening.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.194
Music's changing.

03:58.368 --> 03:59.369
I got this beautiful
salmon steak idea

03:59.543 --> 04:01.328
from Ina Rosenberg's cookbook.

04:01.502 --> 04:03.721
She has beautiful lemon slices
on the salmon.

04:03.895 --> 04:05.419
Oh!

04:05.593 --> 04:07.072
What? So I need them.
I need the lemons.

04:07.247 --> 04:09.553
Shells, you've got
the wrong clip-ons.

04:09.727 --> 04:11.033
Oh, my God.
I mean, when did they put

04:11.207 --> 04:12.600
that door handle on anyway?

04:12.774 --> 04:13.688
Like, two weeks ago?

04:13.862 --> 04:15.342
It was, like, three months ago.

04:15.516 --> 04:16.821
Oh, my God, I keep forgetting
that it's there.

04:16.995 --> 04:18.040
Well, yeah,
because you're old.

04:18.214 --> 04:19.215
I mean, I'm older.

04:19.389 --> 04:20.303
I'm not that old.

04:20.477 --> 04:21.957
Okay, come on.

04:22.131 --> 04:23.698
Come on!

04:25.961 --> 04:27.528
Let's go!

04:29.921 --> 04:31.358
Come on!

04:32.968 --> 04:34.274
Fuck you, door handle.

04:34.448 --> 04:35.623
...I could go back in time,
you know,

04:35.797 --> 04:37.146
and see the door handle,
say to myself--

04:37.320 --> 04:38.234
You ladies mind
moving a little faster?

04:38.408 --> 04:40.149
Everyone else is out there.

04:40.323 --> 04:41.890
You're the only ones acting
like you're at fuckin' brunch.

04:42.064 --> 04:43.979
Oh, like anyone gives
a flying shit, Eddie.

04:44.153 --> 04:45.415
What are there, 12 people?

04:45.589 --> 04:46.373
Excuse me.
You know who gives a shit?

04:46.547 --> 04:47.939
I do. I give a shit.

04:48.113 --> 04:49.550
It's my job to get you on stage.

04:49.724 --> 04:51.073
Have we ever not made it
on the stage, Eddie?

04:51.247 --> 04:52.944
- Shell!
- Jesus.

04:54.119 --> 04:55.991
Cue 453, go.

05:13.661 --> 05:15.271
So, who's the guy?

05:15.445 --> 05:17.491
Rick. He saw me
leaving the parking lot.

05:17.665 --> 05:21.973
Oh, a stage door
Johnny situation, huh?

05:22.147 --> 05:24.062
Paging stage door Johnny!

05:24.236 --> 05:25.629
- Shh! Shh!
- Aisle four!

05:25.803 --> 05:27.109
No, he recognized me
in the parking lot.

05:27.283 --> 05:28.676
Uh-huh.

05:28.850 --> 05:30.765
Does he think
you're a escort on the side?

05:30.939 --> 05:32.288
Annette, no!

05:32.462 --> 05:34.769
What? Guys think that.

05:34.943 --> 05:36.336
Well, they do.

05:36.510 --> 05:38.250
Well, Rick is nice. He likes me.

05:38.425 --> 05:39.774
He doesn't think that.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.384
<i>Please scan your item again.</i>

05:41.558 --> 05:43.038
<i>Please scan your item again.</i>

05:43.212 --> 05:44.474
Well, it's on there.

05:44.648 --> 05:46.041
- It's right there!
- Wait, wait.

05:46.215 --> 05:47.477
<i>Please scan your item again.</i>

05:47.651 --> 05:49.044
No, it's telling you
to scan it again.

05:49.218 --> 05:50.175
<i>Please scan your item again.</i>

05:50.350 --> 05:51.786
Put it in the bag.

05:53.527 --> 05:55.224
<i>Please scan your item again.</i>

06:00.882 --> 06:02.100
- Oh, no.
- What?

06:04.668 --> 06:07.192
Oh. Have to cancel tonight.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.324
Workin' late.

06:08.498 --> 06:09.717
Yeah, rain check.

06:09.891 --> 06:11.066
Sorry.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.503
You wanna return the fish?

06:14.330 --> 06:15.766
No. It's okay.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.426
Shit.

06:23.600 --> 06:25.950
Fuckin' hell.

06:30.302 --> 06:31.565
She's open.

06:35.786 --> 06:37.875
Good. But then I won!

06:38.049 --> 06:42.837
So what the fuck does it matter
if I previously lost, you know?

06:43.011 --> 06:45.883
Oh, really, you're gonna have
an orange right before dinner?

06:46.057 --> 06:47.494
Well, there's only enough fish
for, like, two people, Annette.

06:47.668 --> 06:48.799
I'm tryin' to get it
where I can.

06:48.973 --> 06:50.018
Oh, gosh,
I'm sorry guys.

06:50.192 --> 06:51.541
A little impromptu soiree.

06:51.715 --> 06:54.152
But I got enough.
Men like to be fed.

06:54.326 --> 06:56.067
Shelly, who is this guy anyway?

06:56.241 --> 06:58.156
Oh, Rick the dick!

06:58.330 --> 07:00.115
I bet you he was married.

07:00.289 --> 07:02.073
Well, he was divorced.
Didn't have a ring.

07:02.247 --> 07:04.641
Uh-huh.
Did you check his pockets?

07:06.121 --> 07:07.470
- He liked me. He--
- Uh-huh.

07:07.644 --> 07:09.646
That's why
we're eating his fish.

07:09.820 --> 07:11.474
Look, girls, you don't have
to worry about me.

07:11.648 --> 07:13.781
I am a very lucky person.

07:14.695 --> 07:15.913
I mean, I am. I have luck.

07:16.087 --> 07:17.654
It's in me.
You know what I mean?

07:17.828 --> 07:19.395
I mean, it's in me.
Not everybody has that.

07:19.569 --> 07:21.092
Sure.

07:21.266 --> 07:22.920
You gonna save your winnings
for when you retire?

07:24.966 --> 07:26.837
What? Retire?

07:27.011 --> 07:29.405
Are you crazy?
Like, bankers retire.

07:29.579 --> 07:32.321
I--What do you think
I have a 501k?

07:32.495 --> 07:34.018
No, I'm not gonna retire.

07:34.192 --> 07:35.716
I'm not gonna retire.
I'm gonna work.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.457
And then,
I'm gonna work some more.

07:37.631 --> 07:38.588
And then I'm gonna die.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.851
I'll probably die in my uniform.

07:41.025 --> 07:43.463
- That's my plan.
- You don't wanna retire?

07:43.637 --> 07:46.248
You know--you know,
it's not an option, Jodie.

07:47.031 --> 07:49.425
Yeah,
isn't it like a requirement?

07:49.599 --> 07:51.035
No!

07:51.209 --> 07:53.037
Esme Rodriguez is 83.

07:53.211 --> 07:54.299
She is still cocktailing.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.823
Oh, my God, she's 83?

07:55.997 --> 07:57.607
83!

07:57.781 --> 07:59.870
I know because I was invited
to the party.

08:00.044 --> 08:02.569
I didn't go
'cause I don't like soft foods.

08:02.743 --> 08:05.572
Well, I can't wait to retire.

08:05.746 --> 08:07.138
You're 19!

08:07.312 --> 08:08.488
It just seems, like,

08:08.662 --> 08:09.663
it's such a wonderful time
in life.

08:09.837 --> 08:11.099
I don't--I don't know!

08:11.273 --> 08:13.623
I just think it seems fun!

08:13.797 --> 08:16.583
You know, learning new things.

08:16.757 --> 08:17.888
Maybe taking up a new language.

08:18.062 --> 08:19.411
No, you can't learn

08:19.586 --> 08:21.196
a new language
that late in life.

08:21.370 --> 08:22.632
The brain doesn't work that way.

08:22.806 --> 08:24.634
Well,
I wanna learn French.

08:24.808 --> 08:27.594
I love languages.
I can say "Je m'appelle Jodie."

08:27.768 --> 08:28.682
- That's good.
- I know how to say

08:28.856 --> 08:29.770
"My name is Jodie"

08:29.944 --> 08:30.988
in five different languages,

08:31.162 --> 08:32.555
including English.

08:32.729 --> 08:34.252
But that's like
the most useless phrase, though.

08:34.426 --> 08:35.384
You could just point
at yourself and say, "Jodie."

08:35.558 --> 08:36.428
Useless?
Are you kidding?

08:38.039 --> 08:39.388
Shelly, let's learn
French together.

08:39.562 --> 08:41.564
No, no. Je m'appelle Shelly.

08:41.738 --> 08:43.784
Hey, guys, you know what?

08:43.958 --> 08:45.437
I like my life, right?

08:45.612 --> 08:47.657
I like it. I like my job.

08:47.831 --> 08:50.007
I mean, most people
don't like playing grab-ass

08:50.181 --> 08:52.749
with a bunch of coked-up
gamblers at 10:00 a.m., but--

08:52.923 --> 08:56.318
- But you are one so...
- But I don't mind it.

08:56.492 --> 08:57.711
They amuse me.

08:57.885 --> 08:59.364
That's right. They amuse me.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.846
And then I can go drink
and gamble on my own time.

09:03.020 --> 09:04.544
Annette is a bon vivant.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.197
Oh, French.

09:09.766 --> 09:12.290
- Who's that?
- Oh, it's Eddie!

09:12.464 --> 09:13.465
- Wait, what?
- What?

09:13.640 --> 09:14.858
Wait, that is gonna be so weird!

09:15.032 --> 09:16.904
Eddie is coming here?

09:17.078 --> 09:18.558
Jodie, what were you thinking?

09:18.732 --> 09:19.950
Well, no, it's not--

09:20.124 --> 09:21.909
and he's like--
he's like our dad!

09:22.083 --> 09:23.519
He's not like our dad.

09:23.693 --> 09:25.216
He's seen our boobs,
like, a thousand times.

09:25.390 --> 09:28.219
Have you never heard
of an impromptu girls' night?

09:28.393 --> 09:30.874
When was the last time
you saw Eddie, anyway?

09:31.048 --> 09:32.702
Oh, no, no, no.
I haven't seen Eddie

09:32.876 --> 09:34.486
since I left the show,
and I have not missed him.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.184
Well, that's not nice.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.403
I feel like we're all
kind of like a big family.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.057
Okay, well, if this is a family,
it's pretty fucked up.

09:40.231 --> 09:42.016
We're tits out all the time.

09:42.190 --> 09:44.845
No, like, you're our mom, and...

09:45.019 --> 09:47.630
Wait. You're tryin'
to make Shelly your mom

09:47.804 --> 09:49.110
- and Eddie your dad?
- Ugh.

09:49.284 --> 09:50.807
I mean, I feel like
this is a family.

09:52.374 --> 09:53.462
- We're a family.
- Okay.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.246
Well, you know what, girls?

09:55.420 --> 10:00.034
I will be the girl outside
getting drunk very fast.

10:01.296 --> 10:02.602
Okay.

10:05.256 --> 10:06.649
- And we used to do that thing.
- Oh, God.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.303
And just sit there like this,
not say a word.

10:08.477 --> 10:09.826
- Oh, wow.
- Naked.

10:10.000 --> 10:11.306
Put it everywhere.
You know what I mean?

10:11.480 --> 10:12.873
- Look who's here!
- Welcome, Eddie.

10:13.047 --> 10:14.918
Hey, ladies.
Hey, Annette, good to see you.

10:15.092 --> 10:16.528
Oh, no, no, no,
I'm not gonna hug you.

10:16.703 --> 10:18.095
- I'm sweating.
- That's okay.

10:18.269 --> 10:19.706
No, no, no, really.

10:19.880 --> 10:21.882
I am not gonna hug you
because I am sweating.

10:22.056 --> 10:23.884
- Okay.
- It's gross.

10:24.058 --> 10:26.277
But it's awful good
to see ya, Eddie.

10:26.451 --> 10:28.845
- Yeah. Yeah, you, too.
- Yeah. Mm.

10:29.019 --> 10:30.847
Show's not the same without you.

10:31.021 --> 10:32.544
It isn't? Really?

10:32.719 --> 10:34.938
I kind of feel like it is.

10:35.939 --> 10:38.289
Oh. I mean,
technically, it is.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.465
- Yeah.
- It is the same show.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.033
Um, just meant figuratively.

10:43.207 --> 10:44.556
Yeah.

10:44.731 --> 10:48.473
Hey, um,
who took over my track again?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.737
Was it, um--wait.

10:50.911 --> 10:52.086
Uh, Valerie?

10:52.260 --> 10:54.436
- Francine.
- Francine!

10:54.610 --> 10:56.743
Francine, yeah.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.005
She sucked.

10:58.179 --> 11:00.921
I mean, she can't fouette.

11:01.095 --> 11:03.314
She really--
she's a terrible dancer.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.490
But how did she take
over my track?

11:06.404 --> 11:08.711
She does the pas de deux
in the fairy ballet?

11:08.885 --> 11:10.278
She can't partner.

11:10.452 --> 11:13.194
I mean, does she even know
how to partner?

11:13.368 --> 11:14.674
Yeah, I mean,
it's been six years

11:14.848 --> 11:15.936
since you left the show.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.198
She does it every night.

11:17.372 --> 11:19.156
She figured it out.

11:19.330 --> 11:22.029
So, Eddie brought some wine.

11:22.203 --> 11:24.335
Yeah. Should I go open it up?

11:24.509 --> 11:25.685
Yeah.

11:25.859 --> 11:27.338
A little Malbec
for anybody?

11:27.512 --> 11:28.775
Annette? Mary-Anne?

11:28.949 --> 11:30.864
I'm allergic to red.

11:31.038 --> 11:32.169
Yeah, no.

11:32.343 --> 11:35.172
I'm, um--
I'm drinking margaritas.

11:36.086 --> 11:37.609
Okay.

11:38.915 --> 11:40.700
I just--I brought it because--

11:41.831 --> 11:43.441
well, it's funny.

11:43.615 --> 11:45.269
When I was on Siegfried and Roy,

11:45.443 --> 11:47.010
those guys would have us over
on the off days

11:47.184 --> 11:50.274
and I went pretty hard
on the red wine, so...

11:50.448 --> 11:52.624
Wait, they went hard
on red wine?

11:52.799 --> 11:57.020
Yeah, well, it's ages ago.

12:04.680 --> 12:06.116
Uh, there was this one time
when I got caught

12:06.290 --> 12:07.596
in the escape trap
with a white tiger.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.250
- What?
- Yeah. No.

12:09.424 --> 12:11.078
- No!
- Yeah, no, yeah.

12:11.252 --> 12:12.819
So, you know, the tiger's
supposed to disappear off stage

12:12.993 --> 12:14.168
- during his trick, right?
- Uh-huh.

12:14.342 --> 12:15.778
And so I'm down, um,

12:15.952 --> 12:17.388
opening the trap door
onto the floor.

12:17.562 --> 12:19.086
- Yeah.
- And the tiger knows

12:19.260 --> 12:20.696
to go through the tunnel
and into the holding pen.

12:20.870 --> 12:22.219
And somehow,

12:22.393 --> 12:23.612
I got caught in the holding pen

12:23.786 --> 12:25.266
with the white tiger.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.963
And I shit myself.

12:27.137 --> 12:28.965
That is insane!

12:29.139 --> 12:31.751
Did the tiger swat at you?

12:31.925 --> 12:33.753
- No.
- Oh.

12:36.320 --> 12:38.148
They're very well trained, huh?

12:38.322 --> 12:39.628
Oh, very.
Yeah, it's impressive.

12:39.802 --> 12:42.892
- Wow.
- Thank you.

12:43.066 --> 12:45.416
I mean,
that's scary, though.

12:46.548 --> 12:48.202
Great story, Eddie.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.075
<i>I'm still hungry.</i>

12:52.249 --> 12:53.990
That was, like,
two ounces of fish.

12:54.164 --> 12:56.166
I have some cup of noodles
above the fridge.

12:56.340 --> 12:57.820
- Oh.
- If you want that, sweetie.

12:57.994 --> 12:59.213
Thank you.

12:59.387 --> 13:00.954
- Eddie, are you okay?
- No.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.478
I think I swallowed
a teeny fish bone.

13:03.652 --> 13:06.046
- You?
- Um, so listen.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.570
I didn't come here tonight
just to, um...

13:10.920 --> 13:12.879
I got somethin'
I need to tell you.

13:13.053 --> 13:14.576
Are you okay?

13:19.537 --> 13:22.105
Muffy told me
that the show is closing.

13:22.279 --> 13:24.891
I'm sorry. What?

13:25.065 --> 13:26.544
Yeah,
the show's closing.

13:27.458 --> 13:31.071
Oh! Way to bury the lead,
shithead!

13:31.245 --> 13:32.942
Don't call me
a shithead, Annette.

13:33.116 --> 13:35.553
Well, then,
don't fuckin' drop a bomb

13:35.727 --> 13:38.252
in the middle of a dinner
an hour after you've arrived!

13:38.426 --> 13:41.081
I mean, hold on. Hold on.
I mean, Muffy is senile, okay?

13:41.255 --> 13:42.647
She's, like,
a thousand years old.

13:42.822 --> 13:44.519
- She's about to die.
- Muffy is not senile.

13:44.693 --> 13:47.522
Just tell me what she said.

13:48.349 --> 13:50.003
She said the new casino owners

13:50.177 --> 13:52.222
wanna put their own stamp
on the place.

13:52.396 --> 13:53.789
So they brought in the circus.

13:53.963 --> 13:55.922
That show's doing
really well, so...

13:56.096 --> 13:57.749
I mean, who puts money
into a circus

13:57.924 --> 14:00.752
that's not Cirque du Soleil,
right?

14:00.927 --> 14:02.319
That's dumb.

14:02.493 --> 14:04.147
I knew when we started
sharing our theater,

14:04.321 --> 14:06.019
when they started taking
over our Thursday, Friday,

14:06.193 --> 14:07.672
Saturday shows,
it was a bad sign.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.370
No shit.
And also, no, you did not.

14:09.544 --> 14:11.285
- Yeah, I did. Yes.
- No, you didn't.

14:11.459 --> 14:12.460
- Ah, you guys, wait.
- No, you did not.

14:12.634 --> 14:15.506
You guys, our show is legendary.

14:15.680 --> 14:19.249
It is, but Le Razzle-Dazzle,
it's--it's old.

14:19.423 --> 14:21.599
It's the last show
of its kind on the strip.

14:21.773 --> 14:23.340
I know,
that's what makes it so special,

14:23.514 --> 14:25.865
the fact that it's the last one.

14:26.039 --> 14:27.344
It's a show.

14:27.518 --> 14:29.956
It's the costumes, the sets.

14:30.130 --> 14:32.610
Look,
it is a dinosaur, Shelly.

14:34.047 --> 14:35.962
I think we're gonna get
notice tomorrow.

14:36.136 --> 14:38.181
Are you kidding?

14:38.355 --> 14:40.444
You heard this from Muffy?

14:40.618 --> 14:41.924
Yeah.

14:52.630 --> 14:56.417
Oh! What is wrong with you?

14:56.591 --> 14:59.594
Do you like
being the bearer of bad news?

15:00.943 --> 15:02.336
No.

15:02.510 --> 15:03.946
Just it was
important information.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.469
I wanted them
to hear it from me.

15:05.643 --> 15:08.820
Oh, really?
Well, your important information

15:08.995 --> 15:11.040
just broke her fucking heart.

15:16.567 --> 15:17.699
You're saying that you don't do

15:17.873 --> 15:19.179
the straddle, bitch?

15:19.353 --> 15:20.180
I see your warm up
every single night.

15:20.354 --> 15:21.485
I don't look good.

15:21.659 --> 15:23.618
Okay. Yeah, bye.

15:23.792 --> 15:25.794
That's good as wow!

15:25.968 --> 15:28.101
<i>Good evening,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

15:29.058 --> 15:31.060
<i>I regret to inform you</i>
<i>that Le Razzle Dazzle</i>

15:31.234 --> 15:33.671
<i>will have its final performance</i>
<i>in two weeks.</i>

15:34.542 --> 15:36.544
<i>On behalf of Muffy,</i>
<i>as well as our long-time</i>

15:36.718 --> 15:39.112
<i>producing partners</i>
<i>at the casino,</i>

15:39.286 --> 15:42.419
<i>the decision to close the show</i>
<i>has been a hard one to make,</i>

15:43.507 --> 15:45.727
<i>but it's been</i>
<i>an incredible 38-year run,</i>

15:46.510 --> 15:47.685
and they wish to thank everyone

15:47.859 --> 15:49.644
for their hard work
over the years.

15:56.999 --> 15:58.218
Did you guys know?

15:58.392 --> 15:59.741
No! Did you know?

16:01.438 --> 16:02.396
<i>This is your 15-minute call,</i>

16:02.570 --> 16:03.745
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

16:03.919 --> 16:05.616
<i>15 minutes to curtain.</i>

16:20.109 --> 16:24.418
I just want to say
on behalf of myself,

16:24.592 --> 16:28.900
your hard work and dedication,

16:29.075 --> 16:32.687
it's been something special.

16:35.603 --> 16:37.257
I wish everybody
a great show tonight,

16:37.431 --> 16:38.954
and a great show
over the next two weeks.

16:39.128 --> 16:41.261
Thanks.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.054
Hey.

16:52.228 --> 16:53.534
Hey.

17:07.417 --> 17:08.766
You know what?

17:08.940 --> 17:10.377
If they just poured
a little more money

17:10.551 --> 17:12.466
into the advertising campaign...

17:12.640 --> 17:16.296
I mean, our press shots
are from the early '80s.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.995
Aren't you
in some of those shots?

17:20.169 --> 17:23.999
Yeah, I am.

17:24.173 --> 17:26.828
You had the Hindenburg solo.

17:27.002 --> 17:28.656
I did.

17:30.092 --> 17:31.441
How long did you do it?

17:33.313 --> 17:36.359
Well, when I was cast
in '87 until about '99

17:36.533 --> 17:38.187
when Renata joined the cast.

17:38.361 --> 17:40.537
Then she took it over.

17:40.711 --> 17:44.498
I bet you were great, huh?

17:52.071 --> 17:53.855
Did you ever wanna get married?

17:56.510 --> 18:00.209
I was married
when I was really young.

18:00.383 --> 18:02.733
For a short time.

18:02.907 --> 18:04.605
Yeah.

18:06.824 --> 18:09.175
Well, what happened?

18:09.349 --> 18:10.828
I was dancing.

18:11.002 --> 18:12.308
I was already in the show
here when we met,

18:12.482 --> 18:16.007
and he didn't like Vegas much.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.184
He got a job in New York.

18:18.358 --> 18:19.707
The show here
was really thriving,

18:19.881 --> 18:21.578
and there was a lot
of press around us.

18:21.752 --> 18:23.667
It was very exciting.
I was very young.

18:23.841 --> 18:25.713
And so I stayed here.

18:25.887 --> 18:27.454
What did you do?

18:27.628 --> 18:29.412
Well, we tried to make it
work for a couple years,

18:29.586 --> 18:32.023
but eventually
he met somebody there

18:32.198 --> 18:34.504
and he tried to convince me
to come to New York

18:34.678 --> 18:36.463
and dance, and I tried it.

18:36.637 --> 18:38.508
But, you know, I went to an
open call for the Rockettes,

18:38.682 --> 18:42.686
I went to an open call
for a Broadway musical,

18:42.860 --> 18:45.559
I just missed
the thrill of the show here.

18:48.301 --> 18:49.737
You'd be a perfect Rockette.

18:49.911 --> 18:53.610
Yeah, I found all that kicking
very redundant.

19:32.301 --> 19:33.824
<i>Hi, you've reached Hannah.</i>

19:33.998 --> 19:36.349
<i>Leave a message.</i>

19:36.523 --> 19:38.655
Hey, Hannie.

19:38.829 --> 19:41.484
<i>Oh, I tried to call you Hannah</i>
<i>and honey at the same time.</i>

19:41.658 --> 19:44.705
<i>Oh, my goodness. Hannie.</i>
<i>That's funny.</i>

19:44.879 --> 19:49.579
<i>Um, just checking in</i>
<i>to see if you wanted to,</i>

19:49.753 --> 19:53.714
<i>um, you know, get a bite,</i>
<i>get a cup of coffee?</i>

19:53.888 --> 19:55.629
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I don't really drink coffee,</i>

19:55.803 --> 19:59.372
but, um, what I really like
is a nice drink.

19:59.546 --> 20:01.504
But, yeah,
that'd be inappropriate

20:01.678 --> 20:03.419
'cause you're, what, 20?

20:03.593 --> 20:05.639
Oh, my God, you're 22.
How do I delete this thing?

20:05.813 --> 20:07.815
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh!

20:07.989 --> 20:09.512
<i>To listen</i>
<i>to this message, press one.</i>

20:09.686 --> 20:12.211
<i>To delete your message,</i>
<i>press two.</i>

20:12.385 --> 20:14.474
Just shut up!

20:14.648 --> 20:16.302
I'm trying to leave
an important message.

20:16.476 --> 20:17.781
Oh!

20:19.479 --> 20:21.089
Okay.

20:21.263 --> 20:22.525
<i>To hear your options again,</i>

20:22.699 --> 20:25.441
<i>- press three.</i>
- Yes. Yes, okay. Mm-hmm.

20:25.615 --> 20:27.965
Okay. Okay.

20:28.139 --> 20:29.402
Oh!

20:29.576 --> 20:31.055
<i>Message sent.</i>

20:31.230 --> 20:33.232
No! Oh, God!

20:36.409 --> 20:39.890
C'est la vie.

20:50.684 --> 20:53.295
I went
to a dance call today.

20:53.469 --> 20:54.688
You did? Already?

20:54.862 --> 20:56.690
Yeah, what'd you go out for?

20:56.864 --> 21:00.171
Mm, it was a show
called Hedonist Paradise.

21:00.346 --> 21:02.522
I can't believe
that's the title of a show.

21:02.696 --> 21:06.047
What, like
Le Razzle Dazzle's any better?

21:06.221 --> 21:07.962
Le Razzle Dazzle
is a name that's evocative

21:08.136 --> 21:11.618
of another time in history,
of Paris,

21:13.315 --> 21:15.665
of the theater in a way.

21:15.839 --> 21:18.189
You get all that
from Le Razzle Dazzle?

21:18.364 --> 21:20.844
Well, what do you get
from Hedonist Paradise?

21:21.018 --> 21:23.673
I get girls grinding on poles,
doused with water like animals.

21:23.847 --> 21:25.327
Like, it's totally tasteless.

21:25.501 --> 21:26.502
- Tasteless?
- Yes!

21:26.676 --> 21:27.851
You--I--you know,

21:28.025 --> 21:29.375
I can't have
this conversation again.

21:29.549 --> 21:31.115
Well, what do you want
from me, Mary-Anne?

21:31.290 --> 21:33.030
If you think this is
so terrible, why are you here?

21:33.204 --> 21:34.249
I mean, what makes you
wanna do this job--

21:34.423 --> 21:36.207
Because it's a job, okay?

21:36.382 --> 21:37.905
And it pays American dollars.

21:45.173 --> 21:47.262
I don't know.

21:51.701 --> 21:53.616
You wanna see the combination?

21:55.662 --> 21:57.707
Sure.

21:57.881 --> 21:59.361
Okay.

22:01.015 --> 22:03.060
Oh, so there's a chair involved.

22:03.234 --> 22:04.279
Uh, yeah.

22:04.453 --> 22:07.064
So, well, you're, um,

22:07.238 --> 22:10.459
like, backwards on a chair.

22:10.633 --> 22:14.028
And then--and then you're like--

22:14.202 --> 22:17.640
♪ <i>Mm, mm, mm,</i>
<i>mm, mm, mm, mm, mm</i>♪

22:17.814 --> 22:20.730
♪ <i>Slap the thighs, up the body,</i>
<i>through the hair</i>♪

22:20.904 --> 22:22.471
Hold.

22:22.645 --> 22:24.343
And one, two, three, four.

22:24.517 --> 22:25.779
And ass, ass, uh, uh.

22:25.953 --> 22:27.215
Cut it.
This is ridiculous.

22:27.389 --> 22:29.043
One and a two, hold.

22:29.217 --> 22:30.653
- And body roll.
- Okay, yeah.

22:30.827 --> 22:32.829
- And body roll. And hold.
- I'm not mad at it.

22:33.003 --> 22:35.484
And one, two, three, four.

22:35.658 --> 22:37.791
And uh, and uh.

22:37.965 --> 22:40.315
And then you go around.

22:40.489 --> 22:41.969
Uh, on the chair.

22:42.143 --> 22:43.579
- Oh!
- And one--

22:43.753 --> 22:47.191
And hump the chair.
And pulse, pulse, pulse.

22:47.366 --> 22:48.323
And down.

22:48.497 --> 22:50.281
And then you go around.

22:50.456 --> 22:52.240
- And then you go up here.
- Oh, God.

22:52.414 --> 22:55.112
Okay, stop. Stop, please.
I can't. I can't anymore.

22:55.286 --> 22:56.897
I would never audition
for a show like that.

22:57.071 --> 22:58.202
Never.

22:58.377 --> 22:59.421
Okay.

22:59.595 --> 23:00.901
Never.

23:02.642 --> 23:04.295
- Yeah, okay.
- I'm sorry, it's just--

23:04.470 --> 23:06.428
- Okay.
- I can't. I can't.

23:06.602 --> 23:08.735
I mean,
how am I supposed to react?

23:17.221 --> 23:19.180
I don't even know
what I'm gonna do for Christmas

23:19.354 --> 23:21.051
if I don't have this.

23:36.066 --> 23:37.024
Hey, Shell.

23:37.198 --> 23:38.373
Hey.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.466
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.120
All right.

23:46.294 --> 23:47.730
You know, since we lost
those shows, these checks

23:47.904 --> 23:49.906
feel like they're getting
slimmer and slimmer.

23:51.342 --> 23:53.083
Yeah.

23:53.257 --> 23:54.781
Hmm.

23:56.260 --> 23:57.740
Hey, Eddie.

23:57.914 --> 23:59.394
I mean,
are you sure this is right?

23:59.568 --> 24:03.703
This is a lot less than
I thought it was gonna be.

24:03.877 --> 24:06.140
Well, it's less
because less shows.

24:06.314 --> 24:08.751
Oh, well, I know that,
obviously.

24:08.925 --> 24:10.884
I was just thinking, you know,

24:11.058 --> 24:13.713
800 divided by 11 shows
minus the three shows we lost.

24:13.887 --> 24:15.236
Well, you might have been

24:15.410 --> 24:16.933
makin' slightly
more than the ones we lost

24:17.107 --> 24:20.459
because those shows were,
better sold, generally.

24:20.633 --> 24:21.982
Oh.

24:24.419 --> 24:27.727
Um, if you want, I can check
with accounts payable.

24:27.901 --> 24:29.946
Nah.

24:30.120 --> 24:31.905
They're not gonna do
anything about it, right?

24:32.079 --> 24:33.515
No, probably not.

24:35.604 --> 24:38.302
You know, I just, uh,
done the math

24:38.477 --> 24:40.653
and reworked my budget

24:40.827 --> 24:43.177
according to what
I thought it was gonna be.

24:43.351 --> 24:47.486
Organic milk
is so expensive these days.

24:47.660 --> 24:51.141
Oh, they docked me for the wing.

24:51.315 --> 24:52.665
Oh.

24:52.839 --> 24:55.842
- The rip.
- Yeah, shit.

24:56.016 --> 24:57.931
I mean,
it must have been bad.

24:58.105 --> 25:00.237
I mean, it wasn't on a seem,
you know?

25:00.411 --> 25:02.718
No, I think Ida
had to reorder the fabric.

25:02.892 --> 25:04.546
Oh, she did?

25:04.720 --> 25:06.156
Yeah.

25:06.330 --> 25:07.462
Just to repair one wing.

25:07.636 --> 25:08.681
You know, the show's gonna end.

25:08.855 --> 25:10.421
Oh no, I get it.

25:10.596 --> 25:13.599
You're never gonna need
that fabric for anything else.

25:13.773 --> 25:16.515
Well, I'm sorry to me, then.

25:19.822 --> 25:21.563
- Bye.
- Ciao.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.876
<i>To listen</i>
<i>to this message, press one.</i>

25:31.573 --> 25:33.575
<i>Hey, Hannie.</i>

25:33.749 --> 25:36.926
<i>Oh, I tried to call you Hannah</i>
<i>and honey at the same time.</i>

25:37.100 --> 25:41.061
<i>Oh, my goodness. Hannie.</i>
<i>That's funny.</i>

25:42.453 --> 25:45.892
<i>Um, just checking in</i>
<i>to see if you wanted to, um,</i>

25:46.066 --> 25:49.025
<i>you know, get a bite,</i>
<i>get a cup of coffee?</i>

25:49.199 --> 25:50.984
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>I don't really drink coffee,</i>

25:51.158 --> 25:53.769
<i>but, uh, darn it,</i>
<i>I'd have a cup of coffee.</i>

25:53.943 --> 25:55.728
<i>Or maybe I could have some tea.</i>

25:55.902 --> 25:58.513
<i>And, uh, um, you know--</i>

25:58.687 --> 26:01.081
<i>You know what I really want</i>
<i>is a nice drink.</i>

26:01.255 --> 26:02.952
<i>That'd be inappropriate</i>
<i>because...</i>

26:03.126 --> 26:05.346
Well, I could always move in
with you, and pay you rent.

26:07.043 --> 26:08.392
No, my lease is up
in, like, ten months.

26:08.567 --> 26:09.437
You're gonna gamble it all.
I know you.

26:09.611 --> 26:10.960
No, I will not.

26:11.134 --> 26:12.658
I'm gonna lose my house
like you lost yours.

26:12.832 --> 26:15.182
Stop. Hey, Phyllis,
you want another ginger ale?

26:15.356 --> 26:17.010
- Oh, yeah, please.
- Yeah. Jack Daniels?

26:17.184 --> 26:20.100
- Oh, yes, honey.
- Thanks, Annette.

26:20.274 --> 26:22.015
You know, I don't like that.

26:22.189 --> 26:24.539
It makes you think
like I'm irresponsible.

26:24.713 --> 26:27.847
I am not irresponsible.
I'm thinking of opening an IRA.

26:28.021 --> 26:30.197
Oh, I think
you're too old to open an IRA.

26:30.371 --> 26:32.329
Okay, whatever.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.680
I just--I mean, you know me.

26:34.854 --> 26:37.857
- I make money.
- Exactly.

26:38.031 --> 26:40.033
You know, you could always
get together with Eddie.

26:40.207 --> 26:41.600
What?

26:41.774 --> 26:43.036
- Oh, my God, that's a first.
- You could.

26:43.210 --> 26:44.472
Who are you?

26:44.646 --> 26:47.606
Hey, Tony,
I need a Jack and Ginger.

26:47.780 --> 26:49.042
- Hey, we're cutting the floor.
- What?

26:49.216 --> 26:50.957
You and Esme can go home.

26:51.131 --> 26:54.351
- Who's staying?
- Jennifer and Jessica.

26:54.525 --> 26:56.397
Of course they are.

26:56.571 --> 26:59.574
Well, you can tell
one of the assholes over there

26:59.748 --> 27:03.578
to drop that to Zsa Zsa Gabor
in the nickel slots.

27:03.752 --> 27:05.188
Who?

27:05.362 --> 27:06.668
Zsa Zsa!

27:06.842 --> 27:08.191
That's insane.

27:08.365 --> 27:10.193
Look, fine, then if not me,

27:10.367 --> 27:14.676
I just--I think you want
a guy around the house.

27:14.850 --> 27:17.200
You keep dating
these business types,

27:17.374 --> 27:19.594
who come to town two three days,

27:19.768 --> 27:22.684
and you cook for them
like you wanna get married.

27:22.858 --> 27:24.512
I don't.
I don't wanna get married.

27:24.686 --> 27:27.036
Well, I think you forget

27:27.210 --> 27:31.606
guys come to Vegas to get
a story they can go home with.

27:31.780 --> 27:34.827
Like shtupping a showgirl.

27:35.001 --> 27:38.265
- No, Annette! Yes, Annette.
- It's true. Come on.

27:38.439 --> 27:39.745
And you know that.

27:39.919 --> 27:43.487
But you see,
you and Eddie, I mean,

27:43.662 --> 27:45.533
you guys have a history
and he lives here.

27:45.707 --> 27:47.448
Yeah, we have a bad history.

27:47.622 --> 27:49.798
All histories are bad with men.

27:49.972 --> 27:51.104
But you have history.

27:51.278 --> 27:52.801
And you know, he's--

27:52.975 --> 27:56.631
I don't know,
he's a solid enough guy.

27:56.805 --> 27:58.154
I don't particularly like him

27:58.328 --> 28:00.330
or even find him
that attractive.

28:00.504 --> 28:03.682
But, you know,
he might even have a pension.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.596
Do you have a pension?

28:05.771 --> 28:06.989
Do you have a pension?
I don't have a pension.

28:07.163 --> 28:08.469
- No.
- Exactly.

28:08.643 --> 28:14.388
And you know,
I mean, he's cute-ish.

28:14.562 --> 28:18.697
I can also--
I can also get you a job here.

28:18.871 --> 28:20.699
What, cocktailing?

28:20.873 --> 28:22.309
Yes.

28:22.483 --> 28:24.050
Hey, Esme.

28:24.224 --> 28:26.008
You know what? Fuck them.

28:26.182 --> 28:28.707
Right? Screw them.

28:28.881 --> 28:31.013
Seriously.

28:31.187 --> 28:34.103
Hey. You want a cigarette?

29:25.807 --> 29:27.504
Oh, my God!

29:28.767 --> 29:30.681
Oh, my God, is that you?

29:30.856 --> 29:32.727
- Oh! Oh!
- Hey, Shelly.

29:32.901 --> 29:34.468
You got my message.

29:34.642 --> 29:36.165
It's so good to see you.

29:36.339 --> 29:38.167
My goodness,
what are you doing here?

29:38.341 --> 29:39.952
I mean, of course, you know,

29:40.126 --> 29:42.650
I'm happy to see you,
but I mean, jeez,

29:42.824 --> 29:45.479
you could show up at my doorstep
anytime, anywhere.

29:47.176 --> 29:49.788
Oh, it's just
so good to see you.

29:49.962 --> 29:51.485
God, I'm sorry. I'm such a mess.

29:51.659 --> 29:54.662
I mean, I just haven't
had a lot of sleep lately.

29:54.836 --> 29:57.186
Hormones.

29:59.536 --> 30:01.321
Why aren't you in school?

30:01.495 --> 30:04.498
Um, I had to come home
for Lisa's birthday, so...

30:05.499 --> 30:07.196
Oh, it's Lisa's birthday.

30:07.370 --> 30:10.025
I mean, I gotta send her a card
or a call or something.

30:10.199 --> 30:12.027
You don't have to do that.

30:12.201 --> 30:13.768
I want to. I will.
I mean, how is she?

30:13.942 --> 30:16.815
She's, um, how are she and Jeff?

30:16.989 --> 30:20.122
They're really good.
Uh, I'm graduating in May, so...

30:20.296 --> 30:23.822
Oh, I know. I know, hon.
Gosh, you're graduating so soon.

30:23.996 --> 30:25.258
I just can't believe it.

30:25.432 --> 30:27.086
And Becky's graduating, too,

30:27.260 --> 30:29.915
so we're gonna do, like,
a joint party kinda thing.

30:30.089 --> 30:32.482
Oh, really?
Becky is graduating, too?

30:33.701 --> 30:36.791
Yeah, good for her.
Good for Becky.

30:38.184 --> 30:39.228
Yeah.

30:39.402 --> 30:41.622
It's a lot of family time,

30:41.796 --> 30:44.668
so I wanted to get out
of the house anyways.

30:44.843 --> 30:48.934
Sorry.

30:49.108 --> 30:52.372
Oh, you look so beautiful.

30:52.546 --> 30:54.113
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

30:54.287 --> 30:57.638
You're so beautiful,
so grown up.

30:57.812 --> 30:59.292
I just can't believe
I haven't seen you

30:59.466 --> 31:01.555
in what, like, over a year?

31:01.729 --> 31:03.296
Yeah.

31:09.084 --> 31:12.044
So, um, do you have a boyfriend?

31:12.218 --> 31:14.742
Just tryin' to focus
on getting out of school.

31:14.916 --> 31:18.485
Oh, well, plenty of time
for boyfriends, you know, later.

31:18.659 --> 31:19.878
Mm-hmm.

31:27.929 --> 31:31.106
Have you, uh, declared a major?

31:31.280 --> 31:32.629
I'm studying photography.

31:32.803 --> 31:35.154
Oh, my God,
that's so exciting!

31:35.328 --> 31:37.460
Thanks.

31:37.634 --> 31:39.288
Uh, Lisa said
it wouldn't be that useful

31:39.462 --> 31:40.855
to have any sort of arts degree,

31:41.029 --> 31:42.901
but it's the only thing

31:43.075 --> 31:45.729
I'm really passionate about,
so...

31:45.904 --> 31:48.776
Well, I think it's brilliant
that you're doing that.

31:48.950 --> 31:54.042
I mean, being part of a creative
community is--It's the best.

31:55.304 --> 31:56.871
It's the best.

31:57.045 --> 31:59.569
It's pretty solitary.
It's not really a community.

32:01.049 --> 32:02.877
Well, you know,
being an artist is solitary,

32:03.051 --> 32:07.099
but if you're passionate
about it, it's worth it.

32:10.189 --> 32:12.104
You know what?

32:12.278 --> 32:13.932
I really should get going.

32:14.106 --> 32:15.759
Oh, no, no.

32:15.934 --> 32:17.196
I was just gonna say if you
wanted to stay for dinner.

32:17.370 --> 32:18.849
Yeah, I just stopping by
to say hello.

32:19.024 --> 32:22.288
I have to get--
I have to get home for dinner.

32:22.462 --> 32:24.072
Well, I mean,
can't you just give him a call

32:24.246 --> 32:25.944
and say that you're gonna
have dinner here tonight?

32:26.118 --> 32:27.597
It's just one night.

32:27.771 --> 32:31.950
I don't know.
Becky just got home, and I...

32:33.473 --> 32:35.954
I mean, Lisa wouldn't mind,
would she?

32:36.128 --> 32:38.086
Just one dinner.

32:38.260 --> 32:39.958
One night.

32:40.132 --> 32:41.829
I really can't, Shelly.

32:43.831 --> 32:45.572
You know, I was--
I was thinking that, you know,

32:45.746 --> 32:48.401
since the show is closing,
that I could probably get

32:48.575 --> 32:51.752
a couple days off
and come visit you in Tucson.

32:51.926 --> 32:53.928
- What?
- Yeah.

32:54.102 --> 32:55.843
The show is closing.

32:56.017 --> 32:59.020
I can't talk about it too much.
I'll just dissolve into tears.

33:00.152 --> 33:02.893
But, you know, I could
finally have some time off

33:03.068 --> 33:04.460
and come visit you in Tucson.

33:04.634 --> 33:07.986
I could come to your graduation
if you want.

33:08.160 --> 33:11.902
Um, I'll think about it.

33:12.077 --> 33:13.382
Okay.

33:13.556 --> 33:16.124
Come give your mom a hug.

33:16.298 --> 33:17.865
Mm.

33:18.039 --> 33:21.086
Oh, geez.

33:21.260 --> 33:23.479
You know,
if you ever wanna see the show,

33:23.653 --> 33:26.178
there's only a couple left.

33:26.352 --> 33:27.918
What?

33:28.093 --> 33:29.311
Ugh.

33:29.485 --> 33:30.660
Uh, I--I didn't mean it.

33:30.834 --> 33:32.749
Just, you know,
just so nice to see you.

33:32.923 --> 33:36.536
I--trying to find a way
to see you soon.

33:36.710 --> 33:38.320
Um.

33:38.494 --> 33:40.975
Yeah. Little misstep.

33:41.149 --> 33:42.194
It's okay.

33:42.368 --> 33:43.499
Okay.

33:43.673 --> 33:46.502
- See you, Shelly.
- See you.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.489
I have, like,
a big girls night,

35:43.663 --> 35:45.752
it was too much fun.

35:45.926 --> 35:48.146
I was, like, hurting.

35:48.320 --> 35:49.669
You know what,
like, if I get home,

35:49.843 --> 35:51.061
- like, starving.
- Yeah.

35:51.236 --> 35:52.933
- Then I have no dinner.
- Yeah.

35:53.107 --> 35:55.675
But normally if I'm starvin',
I could just get food court.

35:55.849 --> 35:57.329
'Cause it's like you need
energy before,

35:57.503 --> 35:59.113
but also--it's--

35:59.287 --> 36:00.462
You'd think they
could get our set in place

36:00.636 --> 36:01.768
before our damn call times,

36:01.942 --> 36:02.899
so we can warm up.

36:03.073 --> 36:06.164
Our entire crew is out there.

36:09.254 --> 36:10.820
I saw it.

36:10.994 --> 36:13.214
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

36:15.825 --> 36:17.653
It was pretty awesome.

36:17.827 --> 36:20.265
The Dirty Circus was awesome?

36:21.091 --> 36:22.397
Yeah, it was really funny.

36:22.571 --> 36:24.094
Mm-hmm.

36:24.269 --> 36:26.184
And the acts were really
hard and impressive.

36:26.358 --> 36:28.186
Sounds like every other circus.

36:29.099 --> 36:31.754
I've never seen
a circus like that.

36:31.928 --> 36:34.279
And that made it awesome?

36:34.453 --> 36:36.803
Yeah, kind of.

36:36.977 --> 36:39.022
Got turned down
for three shows.

36:39.197 --> 36:41.938
- What?
- Which ones?

36:42.112 --> 36:44.376
Boy, I look too old
for Jungle Island,

36:44.550 --> 36:46.639
Paradise Hedonist,
Paradise Island,

36:46.813 --> 36:48.293
whatever the fuck.

36:48.467 --> 36:49.598
"Look too old."

36:49.772 --> 36:50.947
Like, they were
absolutely looking

36:51.121 --> 36:52.340
for girls who were barely 18.

36:52.514 --> 36:53.428
Like, they were like,

36:53.602 --> 36:55.343
"Did you turn 18 yesterday?"

36:55.517 --> 36:57.258
What were the others?

36:57.432 --> 37:00.348
Oh, I'm not stacked enough
for Oz Land or Pin up Girls.

37:00.522 --> 37:02.176
No, honey,
you don't even want those shows.

37:02.350 --> 37:04.570
They're so bad.
They're so low class.

37:04.744 --> 37:05.745
Low class?

37:05.919 --> 37:07.399
What is this?

37:07.573 --> 37:08.487
The show is famous!

37:08.661 --> 37:09.662
It's a tradition

37:09.836 --> 37:10.837
that had its roots in France!

37:11.011 --> 37:11.968
Oh, my God!

37:12.142 --> 37:14.057
Fucking France show!

37:14.232 --> 37:15.581
I mean, it's the last
remaining descendant

37:15.755 --> 37:17.235
of Parisian Lido culture.

37:17.409 --> 37:18.845
Shelly, nobody knows
what the fuck that means.

37:19.019 --> 37:20.194
Well, just like
the shows in Paris.

37:20.368 --> 37:22.196
I mean, you think 85
is a big cast?

37:22.370 --> 37:24.851
There was 160 of us
back in the '80s.

37:25.025 --> 37:26.766
American Express
did a travel campaign,

37:26.940 --> 37:28.333
and they flew us
all over the world,

37:28.507 --> 37:30.248
and photographed us
in different sites.

37:30.422 --> 37:32.511
They shot me
on the Great Wall of China.

37:32.685 --> 37:33.903
I was very special.

37:34.077 --> 37:35.340
I'm sure, Shell.

37:35.514 --> 37:37.255
Super special.

37:37.429 --> 37:40.170
Well, I mean, Las Vegas used
to treat us like movie stars.

37:40.345 --> 37:42.042
The iconic American showgirl.

37:42.216 --> 37:44.087
The Las Vegas showgirl.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.828
We were ambassadors.

37:46.002 --> 37:47.439
For style and grace.

37:48.657 --> 37:49.876
You know, it's just--

37:50.050 --> 37:52.052
it's the costumes.

37:52.226 --> 37:53.793
I mean, it makes you feel
like you're stepping out

37:53.967 --> 37:56.274
of the pages of <i>Vogue</i>magazine.

37:56.448 --> 37:58.928
I think that's why women
like to come to the show.

37:59.102 --> 38:00.495
The glamor is undeniable.

38:00.669 --> 38:03.106
The glamor. I think
I can deny the glamor.

38:03.281 --> 38:04.543
I mean,
maybe times have changed.

38:04.717 --> 38:05.631
Yes.

38:05.805 --> 38:07.589
Shell, they've changed.

38:07.763 --> 38:09.983
And times are brand
spanking different.

38:10.157 --> 38:12.855
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>this is your half-hour call.</i>

38:13.029 --> 38:15.293
<i>30 minutes to curtain.</i>

38:19.209 --> 38:22.517
Mm-hmm, casting call.

38:59.424 --> 39:02.035
Oh, my God, Hannah!

39:02.209 --> 39:03.776
What a nice surprise!

39:03.950 --> 39:05.995
Come on in!

39:06.169 --> 39:07.649
What are you doing here?

39:07.823 --> 39:10.260
I just thought
we could have that dinner.

39:18.225 --> 39:20.836
So, what's the plan
after graduation?

39:21.010 --> 39:23.361
I don't know. I think
I might save some more money

39:23.535 --> 39:26.276
and then, I kinda
just wanna travel around.

39:26.451 --> 39:28.975
Like, I really wanna go
to Europe, but--

39:29.149 --> 39:30.890
Oh, that sounds amazing.

39:31.064 --> 39:33.022
You've got to do that.

39:33.196 --> 39:35.373
- It's just expensive.
- Yeah.

39:35.547 --> 39:38.158
Hey, you know,
being a photographer is just--

39:38.332 --> 39:41.161
- it's just hard.
- What?

39:41.335 --> 39:44.251
- It's a hard career path.
- Says who?

39:44.425 --> 39:46.514
Like, everybody.

39:46.688 --> 39:48.429
Really someone said
being an artist is hard?

39:48.603 --> 39:51.127
Someone put that dumb sentence
in your head?

39:51.301 --> 39:53.695
Yeah. Lisa, for one.

39:53.869 --> 39:55.567
Oh, well.

40:01.834 --> 40:03.879
That's what parents say
when they want you to get a job

40:04.053 --> 40:06.273
that, like, pays money.

40:06.447 --> 40:09.058
Honey, well,
she's not your actual parent.

40:09.232 --> 40:11.060
I mean, she might think she is.

40:11.234 --> 40:14.150
But doing a job
that you don't really love,

40:14.324 --> 40:15.717
that's hard.

40:16.457 --> 40:17.980
You know, when your calling
is out there,

40:18.154 --> 40:20.461
just waiting for you.

40:20.635 --> 40:24.422
You know, money doesn't make
a boring job that much better.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.337
What does Lisa want you to do?

40:28.556 --> 40:31.167
Uh, she thinks I'd be great
at, like, graphic design.

40:31.341 --> 40:33.561
Well, does that interest
you right now?

40:33.735 --> 40:34.823
No.

40:36.434 --> 40:38.044
Well, forget about it.

40:38.218 --> 40:39.959
Hard.

40:40.133 --> 40:43.658
That's the dumbest phrase anyone
told anybody with a dream.

40:46.356 --> 40:48.054
I'll meet you in Paris.

40:51.405 --> 40:53.059
- Oh, my God! What was that?
- What?

40:53.233 --> 40:54.364
I saw something scurry
across the room.

40:54.539 --> 40:55.931
- What, like, a mouse?
- Yes!

40:56.105 --> 40:57.063
- No.
- Oh, my God, yes, yes.

40:57.237 --> 40:58.151
They live in the hidey-holes.

40:58.325 --> 40:59.631
That's where the gangsters used

40:59.805 --> 41:00.762
to keep their money
before I moved here.

41:00.936 --> 41:02.372
I wish I knew where it was.

41:02.547 --> 41:04.592
Oh, my God!

41:04.766 --> 41:07.813
- There it is again! There it is.
- Wait, what are you doing?

41:45.590 --> 41:47.243
<i>Let's go for 68.</i>

41:47.417 --> 41:49.463
<i>Go on cue 68.</i>

41:49.637 --> 41:51.378
<i>Quiet and blackout.</i>

41:51.552 --> 41:52.988
<i>Resepct the process people.</i>

41:53.162 --> 41:54.642
<i>Stay focused.</i>

41:59.995 --> 42:01.083
Shelly?

42:04.304 --> 42:05.435
Standby for 771.

42:05.610 --> 42:07.481
Can we get dancers
in their places?

42:07.655 --> 42:08.830
Before, I don't know,
before hell freezes over.

42:09.004 --> 42:10.745
Thank you.

42:13.661 --> 42:15.010
<i>Thanks, everyone. Great show.</i>

42:15.184 --> 42:16.534
<i>See you tomorrow.</i>

42:37.555 --> 42:38.686
Oh!

42:38.860 --> 42:40.732
- Hi.
- Oh, my gosh!

42:40.906 --> 42:42.864
Oh, hey.

42:43.038 --> 42:45.563
Hi!

42:46.694 --> 42:48.348
I saw the show tonight.

42:48.522 --> 42:50.437
Oh, you did?

42:50.611 --> 42:52.265
Well, that was sweet of you.

42:52.439 --> 42:55.877
I, um, it means a lot to me
that you came.

42:56.051 --> 42:59.185
I wasn't sure if
I was even gonna tell you.

42:59.359 --> 43:01.013
There was barely anyone there.

43:01.187 --> 43:03.058
Yeah, well...

43:03.232 --> 43:05.147
I think that was the worst house
we've ever had in the history

43:05.321 --> 43:06.540
of the whole entire show.

43:06.714 --> 43:09.325
What was there,
like, 18 people there?

43:09.499 --> 43:10.762
I wish I'd known you were here.

43:10.936 --> 43:12.067
I would have done
a little shout out

43:12.241 --> 43:13.808
or kind of point or something.

43:15.593 --> 43:18.857
I thought you were just
heading back to the Kelly's.

43:21.381 --> 43:22.817
What'd you think?

43:23.688 --> 43:25.907
I think I thought
it would be different.

43:26.081 --> 43:27.561
Oh, yeah?

43:27.735 --> 43:30.695
Yeah, like harder dancing
or something.

43:30.869 --> 43:33.045
Oh, you know,
we just make it look easy.

43:33.219 --> 43:36.744
It's kind of
just a stupid nudie show.

43:36.918 --> 43:40.661
Well, it's a spectacle
with dancing nudes,

43:40.835 --> 43:44.012
but it's certainly
not a nudie show.

43:44.186 --> 43:47.015
Dancing nudes, is that,
like, a technical term?

43:47.189 --> 43:49.844
Yeah, yes, it is.

43:52.412 --> 43:54.153
What's the point of that show?

43:54.327 --> 43:56.024
I mean, what was that?

43:57.112 --> 43:58.548
Why did you invite me?

43:58.723 --> 44:00.812
Maybe you thought
I wouldn't come?

44:00.986 --> 44:02.161
I don't know.

44:03.292 --> 44:04.990
I don't know why I did come.

44:05.164 --> 44:09.647
Although, uh, I guess,
it's because I just hoped--

44:10.909 --> 44:13.259
I wanted to know
that it was worth it.

44:13.433 --> 44:15.304
That it was better than me
after all.

44:15.478 --> 44:16.958
What?

44:17.132 --> 44:19.744
That you didn't put
this lame trash above me.

44:19.918 --> 44:21.223
It's not!

44:21.397 --> 44:22.834
I disagree.

44:23.008 --> 44:24.662
Plus, I didn't put anything
above you.

44:24.836 --> 44:26.576
- I provided for you.
- I keep forgetting

44:26.751 --> 44:28.883
that you're not actually
a reasonable person.

44:29.057 --> 44:30.885
That you left me
in the casino parking lot

44:31.059 --> 44:33.583
with a Game Boy while you did
two shows a night.

44:33.758 --> 44:35.760
I didn't think it was
appropriate for you backstage.

44:35.934 --> 44:37.413
Well, yeah, it wasn't.

44:37.587 --> 44:39.981
I couldn't afford help, Hannah.

44:42.636 --> 44:43.898
I just did the best I can.

44:44.072 --> 44:46.161
I just did the best I can,
Hannah.

44:47.336 --> 44:49.904
And if you can do
what you love for 30 years,

44:50.078 --> 44:52.254
you know, and be passionate
about your career--

44:52.428 --> 44:54.779
What kind of career is this?

44:54.953 --> 44:59.174
You're in the goddamn back
of 80 topless dancers.

45:00.001 --> 45:03.352
This was worth missing bedtime
for most of my childhood?

45:04.353 --> 45:05.877
Was it?

45:09.794 --> 45:11.926
See, this is why I came tonight.

45:12.100 --> 45:14.146
I wanted
to see a reason in all this,

45:14.320 --> 45:16.975
and tonight I finally didn't.

45:27.681 --> 45:29.117
Shelly.

45:29.291 --> 45:31.946
Look, I'm sorry, Hannah.

45:32.120 --> 45:34.383
I'm sorry you didn't get
what you wanted from me.

45:34.557 --> 45:37.169
You know,
but if you could forgive me,

45:37.343 --> 45:39.519
anytime, anytime in your life,

45:39.693 --> 45:41.390
I would love that.

45:41.564 --> 45:43.175
But I can't defend myself
anymore.

45:43.349 --> 45:44.524
I just can't.

46:21.474 --> 46:23.781
Hey, I'm still here.

46:26.827 --> 46:29.221
Sorry, I thought
I saw Shelly go.

46:30.135 --> 46:33.486
- Yeah, I'm going. I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

46:33.660 --> 46:36.576
Are you--are you--

46:36.750 --> 46:38.143
you're Hannah?

46:38.317 --> 46:41.363
Yeah, I know I probably
shouldn't be back here.

46:42.712 --> 46:44.149
Did you come to see the show?

46:44.323 --> 46:46.542
Um, yeah.

46:46.716 --> 46:47.848
Yeah, what'd you think?

46:48.022 --> 46:51.286
Uh, not really my thing.

46:56.248 --> 46:58.119
She talks about you
all the time.

47:00.774 --> 47:03.255
Yeah, uh, I think
I should get going.

47:03.429 --> 47:06.867
Yeah, no, sorry. I didn't mean
to keep you, it's just, uh...

47:12.568 --> 47:14.179
It's good seeing you.

47:14.353 --> 47:15.963
You, too.

47:30.412 --> 47:32.458
Oh, hey, sweetie.

47:32.632 --> 47:34.677
Uh, what are you doing here?

47:34.852 --> 47:38.246
I just, um, wanted to come over.

47:38.420 --> 47:39.857
Okay.

47:43.208 --> 47:44.557
Can I come in?

47:44.731 --> 47:48.213
You know, it's just,
um, is everything okay?

47:48.387 --> 47:51.042
I mean, it's just
not a good time right now.

47:51.216 --> 47:54.088
Um, it's just,
my mom, she won't--

47:54.262 --> 47:59.746
she won't answer my--
my--my calls.

48:00.529 --> 48:03.924
And... I wanna talk to her.

48:04.098 --> 48:06.057
I understand it's hard.

48:06.231 --> 48:07.406
Give her time.

48:07.580 --> 48:08.668
Your mom's just sad.

48:08.842 --> 48:11.062
I mean, that you left like that.

48:11.236 --> 48:13.281
I know,
but I still wanna talk to her.

48:13.455 --> 48:14.761
Look, it's a bad time right now.

48:14.935 --> 48:16.545
I just--
I just can't do it right now.

48:16.719 --> 48:19.722
- I can't.
- Shelly, I'm really scared.

48:22.334 --> 48:25.119
I didn't--I didn't know
that I could never go back.

48:26.077 --> 48:27.556
I didn't know
that I could never go back,

48:27.730 --> 48:29.776
and I'm--and I'm really scared.

48:29.950 --> 48:31.647
I'm sorry, I just--I just can't.

48:31.821 --> 48:33.084
Not right now.
I need to be alone.

48:33.258 --> 48:34.650
I'm doing something.

51:41.750 --> 51:44.013
I can't believe I left the way
I did the other night.

51:44.188 --> 51:46.103
I just feel so terrible.

51:46.799 --> 51:48.279
I just--

51:48.453 --> 51:50.368
I don't know how
I could do anything I'd done.

51:50.542 --> 51:52.631
I don't know how I missed out
on our life together.

51:52.805 --> 51:55.938
I just--I don't wanna leave it
on a phone message.

51:56.113 --> 52:00.291
So could you please, please?

52:01.988 --> 52:05.034
Please, please, please,
please call me back.

52:28.449 --> 52:30.408
<i>Is this</i>
<i>the worst audience ever?</i>

52:30.582 --> 52:33.237
I mean, I just wanna yell
at them and say, "Wake up!

52:33.411 --> 52:35.369
This is a live performance.
What, are you bored?

52:35.543 --> 52:39.156
This is breast,
and rhinestones, and joy!"

52:41.810 --> 52:43.116
Oh, God.

52:43.290 --> 52:45.074
Can you help me
with my shoes, please?

52:46.206 --> 52:48.208
How'd you do this
before I was here?

52:48.382 --> 52:51.168
For 30 years, how'd you make
all your quick changes?

52:51.342 --> 52:52.908
Oh, I'm glad
you feel so necessary, Jodie.

52:53.082 --> 52:55.128
I mean, that's important.
That's good.

52:56.825 --> 52:58.436
Do you hear where we're at?

52:58.610 --> 53:01.090
Can you help me
with my necklace?

53:02.091 --> 53:03.658
No.

53:05.269 --> 53:07.445
No, I wanna see you
get ready by yourself.

53:07.619 --> 53:09.447
I wanna see what would happen
to you if I didn't help.

53:09.621 --> 53:10.709
Really?

53:12.406 --> 53:14.539
Okay,
now you're stressing me out.

53:14.713 --> 53:15.757
Good.

53:15.931 --> 53:16.932
You're always behind, too.

53:17.106 --> 53:18.717
Oh, that is bullshit.

53:18.891 --> 53:20.458
Well, good luck.

53:20.632 --> 53:22.024
Well, you know what?
We have plenty of time,

53:22.199 --> 53:23.156
so I'm actually
not even worried about this.

53:23.330 --> 53:24.897
Well, I'm slightly concerned.

53:25.071 --> 53:26.768
I mean, with the wings,
it's gonna be a little tight.

53:26.942 --> 53:28.030
Okay, well, then
just keep goin'. Stop talking.

53:28.205 --> 53:29.031
Oh, my God. Stop yelling at me.

53:29.206 --> 53:30.119
I'm gonna get anxious!

53:30.294 --> 53:32.339
I'm not even yelling.

53:32.513 --> 53:34.167
Okay, where are my clip-ons?

53:34.341 --> 53:35.734
I don't know.

53:35.908 --> 53:38.171
- Did you take them?
- No.

53:39.216 --> 53:40.347
Ugh.
Would you please help me

53:40.521 --> 53:42.262
- with my damn wings?
- Nope.

53:42.436 --> 53:44.177
You should have thought
of this pointless challenge

53:44.351 --> 53:45.700
before the show,
so I was ready for it.

53:45.874 --> 53:47.224
Well, here's your warning
for tomorrow.

53:47.398 --> 53:48.790
- Okay.
- This is good.

53:48.964 --> 53:50.662
This is character building!

53:50.836 --> 53:53.578
Just what I need is, a lesson
in character from a 19-year-old.

53:57.103 --> 53:58.887
I got it, got it.
I got it.

53:59.061 --> 54:01.020
Yeah, I got it.

54:01.194 --> 54:03.979
Good! I'm glad you can
get into your costumes alone.

54:07.896 --> 54:09.550
Shelly, come on.

54:10.812 --> 54:11.857
Oh, oh, oh.

54:12.031 --> 54:13.467
Oh, no!

54:18.690 --> 54:20.692
The music is changing.
Jodie, we have to go.

54:20.866 --> 54:22.911
You're a real asshole,
you know that?

54:39.798 --> 54:40.973
Hey.

54:41.147 --> 54:42.366
Hey.

54:43.192 --> 54:44.803
May I have Ida
take a look at that?

54:44.977 --> 54:46.283
Oh, no.

54:46.457 --> 54:48.720
They'll probably
dock me again, right?

54:48.894 --> 54:50.591
Yeah, probably.

54:51.853 --> 54:53.899
Do you know how much longer
you're gonna be?

54:54.073 --> 54:56.031
Oh. I don't know.

54:56.205 --> 54:57.468
Not long.

54:58.338 --> 55:00.384
Well, it doesn't have
to be perfect.

55:00.558 --> 55:02.386
There's only a few shows left.

55:05.476 --> 55:07.434
You know, I was thinkin'...

55:13.092 --> 55:14.833
I mean, you, more than anyone,

55:15.790 --> 55:18.576
the end of show might be
kind of upsetting.

55:21.622 --> 55:22.754
Yeah.

55:24.625 --> 55:26.410
Do you know what's next?

55:28.586 --> 55:29.891
Nope.

55:30.065 --> 55:31.458
You?

55:33.591 --> 55:35.462
Probably gonna stay here.

55:35.636 --> 55:37.464
You know, work with the circus.

55:37.638 --> 55:39.597
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Full schedule.

55:39.771 --> 55:40.859
Yeah.

55:42.251 --> 55:45.951
I mean, it's a much easier gig
for the money than the R.D.

55:46.125 --> 55:48.345
So, that's nice.

55:49.607 --> 55:52.305
Oh, that's lucky. I mean,
you'll still be contributing

55:52.479 --> 55:54.742
to your pension
and getting health insurance.

55:54.916 --> 55:56.004
Yeah.

55:57.658 --> 55:59.878
Um, okay.

56:02.054 --> 56:03.795
I just wanted to check on you.

56:11.019 --> 56:12.412
You know...

56:18.157 --> 56:19.680
if it means anything,

56:22.422 --> 56:24.903
you're a real legend, Shell,
you know?

56:39.700 --> 56:40.832
Okay.

56:43.138 --> 56:44.531
Hey, Eddie.

56:44.705 --> 56:45.750
Yeah?

56:48.666 --> 56:50.711
Wanna have dinner with me
one night this week?

56:52.321 --> 56:53.801
You wanna have dinner with me?

56:54.541 --> 56:55.803
Yeah.

56:57.718 --> 57:00.982
I mean, well, um,
I mean, yeah, of course.

57:01.156 --> 57:02.027
That'd be nice.

57:03.332 --> 57:04.595
Great.

57:05.639 --> 57:07.075
- Okay, great.
- Yeah.

58:55.836 --> 58:57.098
- Hi, Eddie.
- Hey.

58:57.272 --> 58:58.186
- I'm here.
- Hey.

59:00.406 --> 59:01.668
Hey.

59:02.930 --> 59:04.932
- It's okay.
- Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

59:05.106 --> 59:06.325
No, you're not.

59:06.499 --> 59:07.761
Just, you know,
debating dresses.

59:07.935 --> 59:09.807
I mean, I probably
shouldn't tell you that.

59:11.025 --> 59:12.461
Oh, funny story.

59:13.288 --> 59:15.160
I didn't have time
to get my nails done,

59:15.334 --> 59:16.465
so I went to the drugstore,

59:16.640 --> 59:18.685
and right next
to my nail files...

59:19.468 --> 59:20.992
- your favorite.
- Oh, thank you.

59:21.819 --> 59:24.386
That's so--thank you,
that's so thoughtful.

59:25.910 --> 59:26.954
Yeah.

59:33.482 --> 59:34.745
I don't, uh,

59:34.919 --> 59:36.877
I don't have anything for you.

59:37.051 --> 59:38.139
It's okay.

59:39.227 --> 59:40.794
You look nice.

59:41.534 --> 59:43.580
Thank you.

59:47.888 --> 59:49.803
Do I look nice?

59:50.587 --> 59:51.892
Yeah. Sorry.

59:52.066 --> 59:53.938
Yeah, you look--
you look really beautiful.

59:54.112 --> 59:55.374
Oh, thank you.

59:55.548 --> 59:57.594
But, well,
you always look beautiful.

59:57.768 --> 59:59.160
Aw, thanks, Eddie.

59:59.334 --> 01:00:01.815
Yeah. It's rare that I actually

01:00:01.989 --> 01:00:04.775
get to see you
in a dress, not, uh,

01:00:04.949 --> 01:00:09.431
one of those rhinestone
bustier things, you know?

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:11.390
I mean,
with your breasts hangin' out.

01:00:11.564 --> 01:00:13.087
Well, I wouldn't say hanging.

01:00:13.261 --> 01:00:15.133
No, no, no.

01:00:16.047 --> 01:00:19.137
But you do, though.
You look really beautiful.

01:00:19.311 --> 01:00:20.355
Even all covered up.

01:00:25.099 --> 01:00:26.448
- Maybe we should order.
- Yeah.

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:28.276
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's order.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:40.462
So, how's Hannah?

01:00:40.637 --> 01:00:42.073
Hmm.

01:00:42.247 --> 01:00:43.988
She's just about
to finish up school.

01:00:45.032 --> 01:00:47.034
Wow. Wow.

01:00:49.733 --> 01:00:52.518
You know, I wondered
for such a long time,

01:00:52.692 --> 01:00:55.086
you know, where she was,
and what she was up to.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.393
If she, uh,
looked at all like me.

01:00:59.351 --> 01:01:00.613
Oh, well. She doesn't.

01:01:00.787 --> 01:01:02.223
No. I know.

01:01:02.397 --> 01:01:04.878
- Thank God.
- Hmm. Mm.

01:01:05.052 --> 01:01:07.272
- What?
- What?

01:01:07.446 --> 01:01:08.882
What'd you say?

01:01:10.014 --> 01:01:11.972
Well, I--I mean, I met her.

01:01:12.146 --> 01:01:13.582
- What?
- Yeah, I met her

01:01:13.757 --> 01:01:15.236
in your dressing room
the other night.

01:01:15.410 --> 01:01:17.456
What? You introduced yourself?
You met her?

01:01:18.239 --> 01:01:20.807
Well, I didn't say--
I didn't say who I was.

01:01:20.981 --> 01:01:23.070
I just, you know,
she asked me what my name was.

01:01:23.244 --> 01:01:24.419
I said Eddie.

01:01:24.593 --> 01:01:26.770
- Thank God.
- Yeah.

01:01:28.989 --> 01:01:31.339
So, is she still living
with the Kellys?

01:01:31.513 --> 01:01:34.168
Well, I mean,
they're in college.

01:01:34.342 --> 01:01:35.430
Yeah.

01:01:37.432 --> 01:01:39.521
I always thought
that was gonna be a,

01:01:39.696 --> 01:01:41.175
like, a temporary solution.

01:01:42.046 --> 01:01:44.831
Well, you're not really
in her life,

01:01:45.005 --> 01:01:47.834
so I don't understand
why it's any of your business.

01:01:49.053 --> 01:01:50.968
No. I'm just curious.

01:01:51.142 --> 01:01:53.013
Hmm. Well...

01:01:57.104 --> 01:01:58.627
She's best friends
with Becky and Theo,

01:01:58.802 --> 01:02:00.586
and Lisa had all the time
in the world

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.849
to devote to her kids,
so, you know?

01:02:03.023 --> 01:02:06.679
Could you have gotten a sitter?

01:02:06.853 --> 01:02:10.596
I made it work,
and that's what matters.

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:12.380
Well, I was just--

01:02:13.207 --> 01:02:14.774
I was just thinking
maybe, you know,

01:02:14.948 --> 01:02:16.645
you could have gotten a job
where you worked

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:18.256
the hours she was at school.

01:02:18.430 --> 01:02:20.911
I mean, you didn't have
to stay with the show.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:23.827
- Of course I did!
- Mm-hmm.

01:02:24.001 --> 01:02:27.656
Worked at a supermarket,
or waited tables, or retail.

01:02:27.831 --> 01:02:29.136
There's lots of retail jobs,
you know?

01:02:29.310 --> 01:02:30.964
I just can't win.

01:02:31.138 --> 01:02:34.141
I mean, God, this is what women
have to deal with.

01:02:34.315 --> 01:02:35.926
You know, all the time,
people are told--they're told,

01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:37.710
"You have to do this,
you have to do that",

01:02:37.884 --> 01:02:39.320
and they'll do the thing
that you didn't want to do,

01:02:39.494 --> 01:02:41.453
take the road
that you should have taken.

01:02:41.627 --> 01:02:42.889
It's so fucking confusing.

01:02:43.063 --> 01:02:44.282
And, Jesus, and, you know, how--

01:02:44.456 --> 01:02:45.892
Yeah.

01:02:46.066 --> 01:02:47.241
How are you saying
any of this when, really,

01:02:47.415 --> 01:02:49.026
you were never there?

01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:50.331
Where were you?

01:02:50.505 --> 01:02:51.985
We weren't even
in a relationship.

01:02:52.159 --> 01:02:53.726
Well, what do you want now?

01:02:53.900 --> 01:02:54.596
You wanna be her father now,
all of a sudden?

01:02:54.771 --> 01:02:55.989
No.

01:02:56.773 --> 01:02:58.122
That's not what I meant.

01:02:59.993 --> 01:03:01.778
What do you want with me, Eddie?

01:03:04.606 --> 01:03:06.217
I just wanna be your friend.

01:03:07.958 --> 01:03:09.307
Oh, God! Oh, my God,

01:03:09.481 --> 01:03:10.656
- this is so embarrassing.
- What?

01:03:10.830 --> 01:03:12.223
Why did I even come?

01:03:12.397 --> 01:03:13.572
- Oh, my God, this is a bad idea.
- Shelly. What?

01:03:13.746 --> 01:03:15.269
This is the worst fuckin' idea.

01:03:15.443 --> 01:03:18.533
Christ! And, like you're
in any position to judge me.

01:03:18.707 --> 01:03:19.883
Like that's what a friend does?

01:03:20.057 --> 01:03:21.580
I didn't mean
to sound like that.

01:03:21.754 --> 01:03:23.321
I love the show.

01:03:23.495 --> 01:03:24.844
I love it.

01:03:25.018 --> 01:03:27.064
I feel so good
about myself in this show.

01:03:27.238 --> 01:03:29.457
And you, and Mary-Anne,
and Hannah can't understand.

01:03:29.631 --> 01:03:32.243
But the costumes, the sets,

01:03:33.026 --> 01:03:35.376
being bathed in that light
night after night.

01:03:35.550 --> 01:03:38.379
Feeling seen. Feeling beautiful.

01:03:38.553 --> 01:03:39.903
That is powerful.

01:03:40.077 --> 01:03:41.948
And I can't imagine
my life without it.

01:03:42.122 --> 01:03:44.081
I just think it's wild
that, you know,

01:03:44.255 --> 01:03:46.474
I'm the one who's been
on the stage all these years.

01:03:46.648 --> 01:03:48.737
That I'm the one
people come for.

01:03:48.912 --> 01:03:50.435
That I'm the one on the poster!

01:03:50.609 --> 01:03:53.394
And you, you, Eddie,
are gonna go on to this show

01:03:53.568 --> 01:03:55.832
or that show and the producers
will just place you elsewhere

01:03:56.006 --> 01:03:57.834
because you know
how to read a lighting cue.

01:03:58.008 --> 01:04:00.488
You just tell someone
to push a damn button!

01:04:02.708 --> 01:04:04.275
And you're gonna be just fine.

01:04:05.102 --> 01:04:07.626
And I just have to disappear.

01:04:09.149 --> 01:04:10.847
Well, you know what?

01:04:11.891 --> 01:04:13.197
I have no regrets.

01:04:14.198 --> 01:04:15.286
None.

01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:16.983
Eat your meat.

01:04:51.975 --> 01:04:53.411
There you go.

01:04:54.281 --> 01:04:57.241
You know,
when my grandparents...

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:02.507
Pearl and Bob, retired...

01:05:02.681 --> 01:05:04.901
from the stationery business...

01:05:07.033 --> 01:05:09.862
they drove around the Southwest

01:05:10.036 --> 01:05:12.125
doing square dancing
competitions.

01:05:14.475 --> 01:05:15.868
That's cute.

01:05:16.042 --> 01:05:18.088
We should do that.
You and me.

01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.352
I thought
you weren't gonna retire.

01:05:22.179 --> 01:05:25.399
We could pick up
flouncy skirts and...

01:05:28.576 --> 01:05:31.579
Shell, I fucked up a little.

01:05:33.799 --> 01:05:35.409
I lost my shirt.

01:05:36.889 --> 01:05:38.499
So what are you gonna do?

01:05:42.677 --> 01:05:44.244
Well, I don't know.

01:05:45.028 --> 01:05:48.074
I don't know what to do.

01:05:50.947 --> 01:05:52.383
I...

01:05:53.558 --> 01:05:54.863
I don't--

01:05:55.038 --> 01:05:57.040
I can't even--

01:05:57.214 --> 01:05:59.172
I mean, I would--can I--

01:05:59.346 --> 01:06:03.437
I can't even--
I can't fucking even ask.

01:06:03.611 --> 01:06:05.439
I can't ask you.

01:06:05.613 --> 01:06:07.485
I can't even do it.

01:06:07.659 --> 01:06:09.226
You have to stay here?

01:06:12.925 --> 01:06:16.015
Yeah, just--I, um...

01:06:17.016 --> 01:06:20.411
I've been taking night shifts

01:06:20.585 --> 01:06:23.196
and showering
in the locker room,

01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:25.894
and I've been sleeping in my car
for the last couple weeks.

01:06:26.069 --> 01:06:27.766
What? You didn't tell me!

01:06:27.940 --> 01:06:29.550
I promise you--

01:06:29.724 --> 01:06:32.162
I promise you I'll be out
of your hair really fast.

01:06:32.336 --> 01:06:33.728
It's okay.

01:06:34.773 --> 01:06:35.774
Fuck.

<i>Thank you.</i>

That's it?

01:11:00.125 --> 01:11:02.736
Yeah, uh, we get the idea.

01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:04.521
Thank you, Sherry.

01:11:04.695 --> 01:11:05.826
Shelly.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.480
Thank you, Shelly.

01:11:14.313 --> 01:11:15.967
You didn't like it?

01:11:16.141 --> 01:11:17.534
Not what we're looking for.

01:11:19.449 --> 01:11:21.102
What are you lookin' for?

01:11:22.713 --> 01:11:24.062
Just a different kind of vibe.

01:11:24.236 --> 01:11:26.369
Okay, well, like what?

01:11:26.543 --> 01:11:28.153
I actually have
a very versatile background.

01:11:28.327 --> 01:11:30.155
<i>Uh, you've been</i>
<i>with the Razzle Dazzle</i>

01:11:30.329 --> 01:11:32.200
<i>for many years, huh?</i>

01:11:32.375 --> 01:11:34.377
Yeah. I mean, before that.

01:11:34.551 --> 01:11:35.595
Just tell me
what you're interested in

01:11:35.769 --> 01:11:37.510
and I'll give it to you.

01:11:39.033 --> 01:11:40.470
I mean,
you're lookin' for dancers.

01:11:40.644 --> 01:11:43.386
I'm a dancer.
I'm an experienced dancer!

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:45.083
<i>We're looking</i>
<i>for dance acts</i>

01:11:45.257 --> 01:11:49.827
that are either acrobatic or...

01:11:52.133 --> 01:11:55.180
sexy.

01:11:55.354 --> 01:11:57.138
Oh, well, I can do that.

01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:59.880
Um, how about a...

01:12:00.054 --> 01:12:01.708
Salome Dance of the Seven Veils
kind of thing?

01:12:01.882 --> 01:12:04.145
Is that something
you'd be interested in?

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.409
<i>It's gonna be a no for today.</i>

01:12:07.714 --> 01:12:09.194
I mean, you can just write
somebody off like that?

01:12:09.368 --> 01:12:10.717
This is how it works?

01:12:10.891 --> 01:12:11.849
<i>This is how auditioning works!</i>

01:12:12.023 --> 01:12:14.678
Thank you. Bye, Sherry. Next!

01:12:14.852 --> 01:12:15.983
I worked really hard.

01:12:16.157 --> 01:12:17.333
Please?

01:12:17.507 --> 01:12:19.683
Please, I worked
really, really hard.

01:12:19.857 --> 01:12:21.380
<i>You know what?</i>

01:12:22.816 --> 01:12:25.036
<i>I can tell you worked</i>
<i>really hard, and I'm sorry.</i>

01:12:25.210 --> 01:12:27.734
It's just--if you were
a really good dancer,

01:12:27.908 --> 01:12:29.127
it would be different.

01:12:29.301 --> 01:12:30.781
But your technique isn't great.

01:12:30.955 --> 01:12:33.044
Okay? You were obviously
hired at the Razzle Dazzle

01:12:33.218 --> 01:12:36.221
because you were beautiful
and young a long time ago.

01:12:37.309 --> 01:12:39.224
<i>I mean, this isn't news</i>
<i>to you, is it?</i>

01:12:39.398 --> 01:12:40.921
Maybe if you'd had some training

01:12:41.095 --> 01:12:42.401
or you'd been
with a company in New York,

01:12:42.575 --> 01:12:43.576
you might have an argument here.

01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:45.883
But, I mean, let's be honest.

01:12:46.057 --> 01:12:47.450
You were hired

01:12:47.624 --> 01:12:49.800
because you were sexy
and you were young.

01:12:49.974 --> 01:12:51.323
I don't know
how to help you if that's--

01:12:51.497 --> 01:12:52.977
if you don't understand

01:12:53.151 --> 01:12:55.153
that's not what
you're selling anymore, baby.

01:12:56.372 --> 01:12:58.025
Next.

01:13:00.071 --> 01:13:02.334
So is this what sexy girls do?

01:13:02.508 --> 01:13:04.249
Is this sexy enough for ya?

01:13:04.423 --> 01:13:05.598
Next, please!

01:13:05.772 --> 01:13:07.078
Is this what young
and sexy girls

01:13:07.252 --> 01:13:08.645
- do so easily?
- <i>Goodbye.</i>

01:13:08.819 --> 01:13:09.994
Oh, is that sexy? Yeah?

01:13:10.168 --> 01:13:11.169
<i>Oh, my.</i>

01:13:11.343 --> 01:13:12.170
Shell, come on, let's go.

01:13:12.344 --> 01:13:13.519
<i>Get her out of here.</i>

01:13:13.693 --> 01:13:14.999
- Shell?
- Who's she?

01:13:15.173 --> 01:13:16.348
Shell, come on, let's go.

01:13:16.522 --> 01:13:18.437
- Shell, come on, let's--
- Let go of me!

01:13:18.611 --> 01:13:20.178
I'm beautiful.

01:13:20.352 --> 01:13:21.658
I'm 57.

01:13:21.832 --> 01:13:24.878
And I'm beautiful,
you son of a bitch!

01:13:25.052 --> 01:13:26.837
Thank you.

01:13:27.011 --> 01:13:28.099
- Next.
- Shell.

01:13:28.273 --> 01:13:29.230
Go do your audition.

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:30.188
You're missing your audition!

01:13:30.362 --> 01:13:31.842
I don't care about it!

01:13:32.016 --> 01:13:33.931
You know,
you should have told me

01:13:34.105 --> 01:13:36.542
a hundred years ago
to quit this stupid bullshit!

01:13:36.716 --> 01:13:38.239
- What?
- God!

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:39.806
You saw it happening.
You saw me losing Hannah!

01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:41.547
You didn't even say anything!
You were there!

01:13:41.721 --> 01:13:42.896
- What? Look--
- Yes!

01:13:43.070 --> 01:13:44.811
We didn't know
what was going on!

01:13:44.985 --> 01:13:45.986
Shell, I--look, we didn't know
what was going on with you.

01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:47.510
Yes, you did.

01:13:47.684 --> 01:13:48.989
You and Jodie want me
to be your mother,

01:13:49.163 --> 01:13:50.687
but I already have a daughter.

01:13:50.861 --> 01:13:52.689
- I have one!
- No, Shell, look, we love you.

01:13:52.863 --> 01:13:54.081
- We--
- I don't love you!

01:13:54.255 --> 01:13:55.735
I don't care!

01:13:55.909 --> 01:13:57.389
I don't care!
Look, what do I have to show

01:13:57.563 --> 01:14:00.740
for the last 30 years
of my life!

01:14:00.914 --> 01:14:04.004
I don't even get to keep
a piece of my costume!

01:14:04.178 --> 01:14:05.745
Shell, where are you going?

01:14:05.919 --> 01:14:07.747
I don't know.
And I don't have to tell you!

01:14:07.921 --> 01:14:08.966
No, I know. The only reason--
I can drive you--

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:10.446
Shell, you shouldn't be driving!

01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:12.273
I'm not going home!

01:14:32.816 --> 01:14:35.079
Fuckin'--fuck you!

01:14:36.646 --> 01:14:38.648
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

01:14:38.822 --> 01:14:40.214
Fuckin'!

01:15:25.259 --> 01:15:27.000
<i>I know</i>
<i>this is probably weird</i>

01:15:27.174 --> 01:15:30.787
<i>leaving on a voicemail,</i>
<i>but I just thought</i>

01:15:30.961 --> 01:15:34.704
<i>maybe we could just remember</i>

01:15:34.878 --> 01:15:37.358
<i>this one thing</i>
<i>I read somewhere.</i>

01:15:37.533 --> 01:15:41.232
<i>You know, our mothers</i>
<i>are not saints or saviors,</i>

01:15:41.406 --> 01:15:43.539
<i>just regular people</i>
<i>doin' the best they can</i>

01:15:43.713 --> 01:15:45.715
<i>with the tools they have.</i>

01:15:45.889 --> 01:15:47.543
<i>I know that's not</i>
<i>a great excuse,</i>

01:15:47.717 --> 01:15:50.241
<i>but I just want you to know</i>

01:15:50.415 --> 01:15:53.244
<i>that I love you,</i>

01:15:53.418 --> 01:15:57.509
<i>however imperfect</i>
<i>that might sound.</i>

01:15:57.683 --> 01:15:59.293
<i>That's just...</i>

01:16:01.426 --> 01:16:03.297
<i>I just wanted you to know that.</i>

01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:09.347
<i>And that life is full</i>
<i>of contradictions.</i>

01:16:09.521 --> 01:16:13.307
And, you know,
this probably sounds crazy,

01:16:15.919 --> 01:16:18.617
I've always only wanted
the best for you.

01:16:21.838 --> 01:16:25.885
<i>I've always been with you</i>

01:16:26.059 --> 01:16:28.758
<i>and I just wanted you</i>
<i>to be safe.</i>

01:16:28.932 --> 01:16:30.716
<i>Safe and happy,</i>

01:16:31.978 --> 01:16:36.156
<i>and fulfilled,</i>
<i>and follow your dreams.</i>

01:16:37.854 --> 01:16:39.290
<i>Just be you.</i>

01:16:46.427 --> 01:16:47.603
I love you.

01:17:01.747 --> 01:17:03.053
Places, please.

01:17:03.227 --> 01:17:05.751
This is your places call
for the last time.

01:17:16.153 --> 01:17:17.807
To the very last showgirls.

01:17:17.981 --> 01:17:19.983
To the very last showgirls!

01:17:26.685 --> 01:17:28.252
<i>Places, please.</i>

01:17:28.426 --> 01:17:31.908
<i>This is your places call</i>
<i>for the last time.</i>

01:17:32.082 --> 01:17:34.040
<i>This is your places call</i>
<i>for the final performance</i>

01:17:34.214 --> 01:17:36.260
<i>of The Razzle Dazzle.</i>

01:17:50.927 --> 01:17:51.971
Mom!

01:17:53.799 --> 01:17:55.409
Hannah?

01:17:57.368 --> 01:17:59.457
What are you doing here?

01:18:15.255 --> 01:18:17.910
- Hey.
- <i>You're lucky.</i>

01:18:18.084 --> 01:18:20.870
You're probably never
gonna leave this theater, huh?

01:18:21.044 --> 01:18:23.437
Yeah, you're right.
Probably not.

01:18:23.611 --> 01:18:25.744
Your ghost is probably
gonna haunt this theater.

01:18:25.918 --> 01:18:29.443
Yeah,
I never thought about that.

01:18:30.793 --> 01:18:32.185
I can't believe
this is gonna be the last time

01:18:32.359 --> 01:18:34.318
I set foot on that stage.

01:18:34.492 --> 01:18:35.711
I know.

01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:39.062
You know,

01:18:39.236 --> 01:18:41.020
I think I'm gonna go
to Hannah's graduation.

01:18:41.194 --> 01:18:42.587
Yeah.

01:18:42.761 --> 01:18:45.503
- I might even move there.
- Really? Wow.

01:18:45.677 --> 01:18:46.809
Yeah.

01:18:48.201 --> 01:18:51.335
Or I could stay here
and maybe get a job

01:18:51.509 --> 01:18:54.207
with Annette, cocktailing.

01:18:54.381 --> 01:18:55.905
Cute outfits.

01:18:56.079 --> 01:18:57.863
Well, not like this one.

01:18:58.037 --> 01:18:59.604
Yeah.

01:19:01.301 --> 01:19:04.870
Well, one last chance
to give 'em hell.

01:19:05.044 --> 01:19:05.915
Ha.

01:19:08.004 --> 01:19:09.614
Shelly.

01:19:12.356 --> 01:19:13.923
