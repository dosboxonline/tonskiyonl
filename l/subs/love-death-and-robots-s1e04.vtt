00:41.880 --> 00:44.672
[woman] Come on, Hank, 
that scarecrow was a gift.

00:44.963 --> 00:47.005
Jake was just trying to be neighborly.

00:47.463 --> 00:49.755
Irrigating each other's crops,
that's neighborly.

00:50.172 --> 00:51.797
Sharing feed, that's neighborly.

00:52.047 --> 00:56.463
That thing out there,
that's just a damn eyesore.

00:57.338 --> 00:58.172
One more slice, hon?

00:58.963 --> 01:01.505
[sighs] Another bite and I'd burst.

01:02.088 --> 01:04.088
[beeping]

01:09.422 --> 01:11.463
-Ah, damn.
-What is it, Hank?

01:11.547 --> 01:12.963
Jenkins' cows again?

01:13.797 --> 01:15.005
Afraid not, honey.

01:15.130 --> 01:17.922
Looks like we got holes
along the pasture fence again.

01:18.088 --> 01:20.672
Looks like there's a few more
out past the back fields.

01:21.297 --> 01:24.172
Yeah. Give Mel a ring,
make sure she's aware.

01:24.963 --> 01:25.797
Better get movin'.

01:26.088 --> 01:28.547
Don't like having our property line
exposed like that.

01:30.797 --> 01:35.422
You be careful out there, Henry Graves!
Mel, are you readin' me?

02:01.005 --> 02:02.172

02:17.505 --> 02:18.672
[Henry] Thing's ugly as sin

02:18.755 --> 02:20.755
-and doesn't even scare crows.

02:20.838 --> 02:23.255
[Beth] <i>If you hate it so much,</i>
<i>why don't you just pull it out?</i>

02:23.338 --> 02:26.005
[Henry] I already tried that, 
it's not budging.

02:26.297 --> 02:28.297
-We're just gonna have to move.
-[cows mooing]

02:29.672 --> 02:34.088
[Henry] I'm coming up on the breach, hon.
Darn cows are in front of it.

02:35.297 --> 02:37.255
[Beth] <i>I told you</i>
<i>to move 'em closer to the house.</i>

02:37.338 --> 02:42.380
[Henry] Go on, get outta here. Shoo!

02:42.755 --> 02:48.297
Moving the herd ain't a quick job, hon.
And I'm a little busy right now.

Oh, shit!

-[woman] <i>Hank?</i>
-Yes, honey.

03:16.922 --> 03:19.130
Eastern corner's
starting to show breaches too.

03:20.088 --> 03:22.130
[Hank] Jesus. More breaches?

03:22.922 --> 03:26.422
I don't know what it is, but something's
got 'em real riled up today.

03:28.713 --> 03:30.213
I'm gonna need more help out here.

03:30.297 --> 03:32.130
All right, I'll get on the horn.

03:42.088 --> 03:43.338
Beth Graves just called.

03:43.713 --> 03:45.880
-Sounds like Hank could use a hand.
-[sighs]

03:45.963 --> 03:48.797
I'm working on Carnigore,
she ain't battle ready.

03:48.880 --> 03:51.713
Come on, Jake,
she ain't never gonna be perfect.

03:51.797 --> 03:55.338
-Just get her out there.
-Carnigore's a work of art, woman.

03:55.672 --> 03:59.338
-You don't just march it into battle.
-You ain't no Michelangelo, Jake.

03:59.838 --> 04:00.755
You know that, right?

04:01.255 --> 04:02.463
I'm more of a Da Vinci,

04:02.547 --> 04:05.005
'cause I got a handle on the aesthetics
<i>and </i>the mechanics.

04:05.088 --> 04:07.088
[laughs]

04:10.380 --> 04:11.380
[wife] <i>How'd it go, Hank?</i>

04:11.630 --> 04:13.047
Well, let's put it this way.

04:13.255 --> 04:16.797
The good news is that I'm moving
the whole herd for you right now.

04:17.630 --> 04:21.047
What the hell?
You seeing this up over the ridge?

04:21.838 --> 04:24.630
Yeah. Can't get a reading on it, though.
Can you get closer?

04:25.422 --> 04:26.380
[Hank] Hang on.

04:30.213 --> 04:31.838
Holy shit!

04:33.255 --> 04:35.588
What? This can't be right.

04:36.088 --> 04:39.297
Sensors say we've got
thousands of DeeBees incoming.

04:39.380 --> 04:42.422
Did you say thousands? Shit!

04:42.547 --> 04:44.463
Tell the others
to meet me at the ridge line.

04:46.047 --> 04:48.963
And get the bunker open.
Start bringing families in.

04:55.838 --> 04:58.630
-[Beth] <i>Mel, you readin' me?</i>
-Yeah. Go ahead, Beth.

04:58.755 --> 05:01.255
[Beth] <i>Hank needs you to get to the ridge</i>
<i>as fast as you can.</i>

05:01.338 --> 05:04.005

-On my way!

05:06.922 --> 05:09.838
[Mel] Sorry, sweetheart, playtime's over.

05:16.213 --> 05:17.047
That's right, Jenny.

05:17.380 --> 05:20.047
Any minute now, the whole damn valley's
gonna be DeeBee central.

05:20.505 --> 05:22.463
Call Deb and Sarah,
pick 'em up on your way.

05:22.755 --> 05:24.588
And then swing by Old Man Harrison.

05:24.672 --> 05:26.630
I don't care how drunk he is,
just get him moving.

05:27.588 --> 05:31.047
Darlene. Jesus,
I've been trying to tran you all night.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.838
Hank needs every mech
you got up on the ridgeline ASAP.

05:36.088 --> 05:37.588
[Jake] Oh, fuck!

05:38.755 --> 05:41.213
Uh, Helen,
you sure I'm in the right place?

05:41.880 --> 05:44.047
Is there a giant breach in front of you?

05:44.130 --> 05:46.713
-[Jake] <i>Yeah.</i>
-Then you're in the right place.

05:46.797 --> 05:49.088
<i>Just hold tight till Hank gets there.</i>

05:51.213 --> 05:53.547
Get that pile of
carnival scrap moving, Jake!

05:53.630 --> 05:55.088
Get off my back, old woman.

05:55.172 --> 05:58.547
[Hank] Will you two knock it off?
We've got work to do.

05:59.255 --> 06:03.088
Not a lotta cover out here, Hank.
Is this really the best place to hold?

06:03.255 --> 06:05.838
If we wanna buy time
for the families to reach the bunker,

06:05.922 --> 06:07.588
it's gotta be here.

06:07.880 --> 06:09.338
Beth, who else is coming?

06:09.422 --> 06:12.672
Zing's cut off.
The Camel brothers are pinned down.

06:13.213 --> 06:14.630
I'm sorry, Hank.

06:15.422 --> 06:17.255
Shit! Just the three of us?

06:18.255 --> 06:20.797
Well, at least I'll die
young and beautiful.

06:35.422 --> 06:37.422

06:42.755 --> 06:46.755
Lock and load, boys.
It's time to see what you're made of.

-What's the status, Beth?
-The Miller family and the Hutts are in.

07:20.255 --> 07:23.755
The Pennybone clan and the Priestleys said
ETA 15 to 20.

07:23.838 --> 07:26.088
-Can you hold?
-We'll do our damnedest.

07:26.505 --> 07:29.047
[Jake] Twenty minutes?
We ain't gonna last two minutes out here.

07:29.130 --> 07:31.213
We're staying as long as it takes.

07:32.547 --> 07:34.963
Here comes a whole lot of ugly!

07:36.422 --> 07:39.338
-They're flanking us!
-Don't let any of them get past you.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.505
There's too many!
We can't cover 'em all.

-Give me a sec, Hank.
-You go. I got this, honey.

07:54.088 --> 07:55.005
[Beth] Hold tight, hon.

07:59.755 --> 08:04.172
Yeah. "Quit your job," they said.
"Become a farmer."

08:04.422 --> 08:08.338
Never fucking mentioned
the goddamn giant fucking insects!

-[Jake] They just keep coming!
-Fall back!

Fuck!

08:14.130 --> 08:16.172
-I'm out of ammo!
-And my missiles are dry!

08:16.797 --> 08:17.755
Come on, Beth.

08:20.463 --> 08:21.338
Yes!

08:22.255 --> 08:24.505
All right, Jake, go reload.
We'll cover you.

Hank, the Franklins
and the Beauregards are comin',

08:31.713 --> 08:33.047
but they ain't here yet.

08:33.130 --> 08:37.380
Some DeeBees are starting to slip through.
The auto cannons are holding 'em back,

We're grabbing our ankles here, Hank.

-What's taking Jake so long?
-Jake?

08:53.213 --> 08:55.713
-Jake?
-Yeah, I'm still reloading.

08:55.797 --> 08:58.172
Carnigore's built for precision, 
not speed.

08:58.297 --> 09:00.922
-[Helen] <i>Jake, are you there?</i>
-Yeah, I'm here. Everything okay?

09:01.297 --> 09:02.588
The last truck's just pulled in.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.505
Grab the others
and get your ass back here.

You hear that, Hank? Everyone's in.
Come on, let's go.

09:08.463 --> 09:12.588
Roger that, Jake!
Mel, time to get the hell outta here.

09:13.422 --> 09:16.297

They're coming from everywhere.

And they call <i>me </i>crazy?

09:46.713 --> 09:48.713
They didn't see that one coming.

Yeah, I'm reading you, Hank.
But I figure...

I'm pretty much screwed.
