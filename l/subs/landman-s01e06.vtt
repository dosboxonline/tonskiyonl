37:33.752 --> 37:36.322
This seem familiar, motherfucker?

37:40.959 --> 37:41.993
Hey, man...

37:44.396 --> 37:45.997
[grunting]

37:51.303 --> 37:54.805
You get on your fucking phone
and call your friends.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.641
You know, the ones
that you called that put

37:56.642 --> 37:58.576
my fucking son in the hospital.

37:58.577 --> 38:00.579
[panting]

38:02.348 --> 38:03.648
No?

38:03.649 --> 38:05.416
He don't want to call
his friends, Boss.

38:05.417 --> 38:07.585
Me and my boys will
take him in the back.

38:07.586 --> 38:08.753
[Tommy]
Okay, I'd appreciate that.

38:08.754 --> 38:09.820
Oh, we'll convince you.

38:09.821 --> 38:10.955

- No. No, fuck.

Here's how this is gonna go.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.989
Needless to say, you're fired.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.392
By noon tomorrow,
you'll be on a "no hire" list

38:47.393 --> 38:50.160
for every fucking oil company
in the Permian Basin.

38:50.161 --> 38:52.196
Sheriff's gonna be here
in about five minutes,

38:52.197 --> 38:54.198
and he's gonna toss
this fucking place.

38:54.199 --> 38:56.066
And I'm just guessing he'll add

38:56.067 --> 38:58.369
felon in possession
of a firearm,

38:58.370 --> 39:00.705
possession of
a controlled substance,

39:00.706 --> 39:03.574
and maybe possession of
a controlled substance

39:03.575 --> 39:05.810
with intent to distribute.

39:05.811 --> 39:09.213
And any goddamn one of those
violates your parole.

39:09.214 --> 39:10.848
And then you add

39:10.849 --> 39:12.383
on top of that shit,

39:12.384 --> 39:15.052
aggravated assault charge
and kidnapping,

39:15.053 --> 39:16.987
'cause when you
shut the door on him,

39:16.988 --> 39:18.424
that's kidnapping.

39:20.459 --> 39:22.092
I ain't a goddamn mathematician,

39:22.093 --> 39:23.861
but that's, like, 30 years.

39:23.862 --> 39:25.430

- [Tommy] That's what I do

39:25.431 --> 39:27.498
to people who hurt my family.

39:27.499 --> 39:29.567
You fucked
with the wrong hillbilly.

39:29.568 --> 39:31.970
[siren whooping]

39:33.672 --> 39:36.574
I'm gonna take 30 years
of your life away from you.

39:36.575 --> 39:40.044
And if you ever come back
to this place,

39:40.045 --> 39:41.546
I'm gonna take the rest of it.

Tommy.

Even wrote 'em down for you.
