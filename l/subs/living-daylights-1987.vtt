<i>Gentlemen,</i>

00:55.472 --> 01:00.603
<i>this may only be an exercise so far as
the Ministry of Defence is concerned,</i>

01:00.686 --> 01:06.784
<i>but for me it is a matter of pride that the
00-Section has been chosen for this test.</i>

01:06.858 --> 01:11.659
<i>Your objective is to penetrate
the radar installations of Gibraltar.</i>

01:11.738 --> 01:14.912
<i>The SAS have been placed
on full alert to intercept you,</i>

01:14.992 --> 01:17.495
<i>but I know you won't let me down.</i>

01:18.370 --> 01:20.122
<i>Good luck, men.</i>

01:26.837 --> 01:29.681
<i>- {papers rattle}
- Oh, blast!</i>

02:24.019 --> 02:25.896
<i>Damn!</i>

02:34.154 --> 02:36.907
<i>That's it, chum. You're out of it.</i>

03:07.479 --> 03:10.107
<i>Game's up, mate. You're dead.</i>

03:25.789 --> 03:27.632
<i>No!</i>

03:29.126 --> 03:32.426
<i>Aarrgghh!</i>

04:04.119 --> 04:05.666
<i>{screeching}</i>

04:08.999 --> 04:10.842
<i>Urgh!</i>

04:26.516 --> 04:27.642
<i>Halt.</i>

04:33.732 --> 04:35.200
<i>Here! Hold on, you're dead!</i>

06:59.502 --> 07:04.508
<i>It's all so boring here, Margot. There's
nothing but playboys and tennis pros.</i>

07:05.008 --> 07:07.136
<i>If only I could find a real man!</i>

07:14.184 --> 07:16.232
<i>I need to use your phone.</i>

07:16.353 --> 07:18.856
<i>She'll call you back.</i>

07:19.230 --> 07:22.530
<i>- Who are you?
- Bond. James Bond.</i>

07:22.651 --> 07:25.871
<i>Exercise control, 007 here.
I'll report in an hour.</i>

07:26.696 --> 07:29.165
<i>Won't you join me?</i>

07:30.575 --> 07:32.498
<i>Better make that two.</i>

07:46.758 --> 07:50.433
<i>Hey, driver, where we going?</i>

07:50.929 --> 07:54.479
<i>I swear my nerves are showing</i>

08:19.374 --> 08:22.344
<i>Hundred thousand people</i>

08:22.419 --> 08:25.889
<i>I'm the one they frame</i>

08:27.424 --> 08:29.597
<i>I've been waiting long</i>

08:29.926 --> 08:34.102
<i>For one of us to say</i>

08:35.472 --> 08:37.520
<i>Save the darkness</i>

08:37.600 --> 08:43.152

09:01.124 --> 09:04.549
<i>All right, hold on tight now</i>

09:05.086 --> 09:08.010

<i>Saunders, head of Section V, Vienna.
You're bloody late.</i>

11:00.910 --> 11:03.754
<i>This is a mission, not a fancy-dress ball.</i>

11:04.330 --> 11:06.424
<i>We have time.</i>

11:08.585 --> 11:11.839
<i>- Now, where's our man?
- In the box. Between the KGB minders.</i>

11:22.682 --> 11:24.559
<i>Lovely girl with the cello.</i>

11:26.603 --> 11:28.446
<i>Forget the ladies for once, Bond.</i>

11:28.980 --> 11:32.610
<i>- Koskov will leave here at the interval.
- Sh! Sh!</i>

11:33.318 --> 11:35.446
<i>We'd better go.</i>

12:08.895 --> 12:10.989
<i>Turn off the lights.</i>

12:29.540 --> 12:34.797
<i>Now, let's understand one another, Bond.
General Koskov is a top KGB mastermind.</i>

12:34.879 --> 12:37.803
<i>His defection is my baby. He contacted me.</i>

12:37.882 --> 12:40.510
<i>I've planned this out to the last detail.</i>

12:41.970 --> 12:46.897
<i>- You'll want the soft-nosed ones, I expect.
- No, the steel-tipped.</i>

12:46.975 --> 12:49.854
<i>KGB snipers usually wear body armour.</i>

12:50.395 --> 12:55.276
<i>- What's your escape route?
- Sorry, old man. Section 26, paragraph 5.</i>

12:55.358 --> 12:59.033
<i>That information is on
a need-to-know basis only.</i>

12:59.112 --> 13:01.035
<i>I'm sure you understand.</i>

13:01.114 --> 13:03.958
<i>Koskov is under intensive KGB surveillance.</i>

13:04.033 --> 13:06.206
<i>A sniper has been assigned to watch him</i>

13:06.286 --> 13:09.381
<i>and he expressly asked
for you to protect him.</i>

13:10.540 --> 13:14.090
<i>- Why me?
- He has the impression you're the best.</i>

13:16.587 --> 13:19.716
<i>- Where's the car?
- In the alley out the back.</i>

13:28.224 --> 13:30.318
<i>Bring the chair.</i>

13:44.866 --> 13:48.166
<i>It'll take him about 10 seconds to reach us.</i>

13:48.244 --> 13:51.248
<i>Plenty of time for a sniper
to make strawberry jam of him!</i>

14:00.631 --> 14:01.974
<i>{applause}</i>

14:40.254 --> 14:42.552
<i>There's Koskov now.</i>

14:46.636 --> 14:48.730
<i>What's he waiting for?</i>

14:49.722 --> 14:52.771
<i>Sniper. Two ﬂoors up, centre window.</i>

14:56.145 --> 14:58.273
<i>The girl with the cello!</i>

15:04.987 --> 15:06.739
<i>Fire, Bond, fire!</i>

15:10.076 --> 15:12.625
<i>Shoot her! What are you waiting for?</i>

15:16.207 --> 15:18.380
<i>You missed... Deliberately!</i>

15:52.201 --> 15:53.168
<i>Where is he?</i>

15:53.244 --> 15:55.463
<i>- In the boot.
- First place they'd look.</i>

15:55.538 --> 15:57.916
<i>- But my escape route...
- Scrubbed.</i>

15:58.833 --> 16:01.052
<i>Get in the front.</i>

16:01.127 --> 16:04.051
<i>- James... James Bond!
- Later, General.</i>

16:05.465 --> 16:09.891
<i>Lose them. I'll pick you up at the border.
2300 hours. Be there.</i>

16:09.969 --> 16:12.893
<i>- How will you get him out?
- Sorry, old man.</i>

16:12.972 --> 16:17.569
<i>Section 26, paragraph 5: "need-to-know".
I'm sure you understand.</i>

16:24.901 --> 16:27.154
<i>- The sniper was a woman.
- I noticed.</i>

16:30.198 --> 16:32.542
<i>- Some of the best KGB shots are women.
- Mm-hm.</i>

16:36.829 --> 16:39.628
<i>- Did you...?
- I'd rather not talk about it.</i>

16:39.707 --> 16:41.550
<i>No, of course not.</i>

16:48.633 --> 16:53.309
<i>They are looking for me! If they
close the border, how will I get out?</i>

16:53.387 --> 16:57.984
<i>Don't you worry about that, Georgi.
We have a pipeline to the West.</i>

17:12.156 --> 17:14.704
<i>- Rosika Miklos.
- Our man here.</i>

17:14.784 --> 17:17.502
<i>Good to work with you
again, Mr Bond. Come.</i>

17:19.664 --> 17:21.632
<i>Keep quiet.</i>

17:21.707 --> 17:23.800
<i>{TV sports commentary}</i>

17:38.224 --> 17:41.569
<i>- We must hurry. Get him in the pig.
- Pig? What is pig?</i>

17:41.644 --> 17:45.615
<i>Scouring plug to clean out the pipeline.
This one's been designed to carry a man.</i>

17:46.941 --> 17:49.364
<i>Pipeline? You mean our pipeline?</i>

17:49.443 --> 17:52.697
<i>Great Soviet achievement -
piping natural gas into the West.</i>

17:53.072 --> 17:56.497
<i>- But... Not me!
- Don't worry, Georgi. It's a piece of cake.</i>

17:56.701 --> 18:01.252
<i>Hm! Never mind cake. If you open valve
before 100, he will be borsch!</i>

18:01.581 --> 18:04.835
<i>Pigs! Borsch! Cake!
There must be another way!</i>

18:05.626 --> 18:10.132
<i>Get in. Put on the mask
and breathe normally.</i>

18:10.214 --> 18:12.467
<i>- Enough talk!
- Relax, Georgi.</i>

18:12.550 --> 18:14.928
<i>Our people have spent months on this.</i>

18:15.011 --> 18:17.355
<i>- How many times have you done this?
- You're the first.</i>

18:27.982 --> 18:32.032
<i>Remember... When this says 100,
turn this. Not before.</i>

18:33.195 --> 18:36.074
<i>- Where are you going?
- To take care of the supervisor.</i>

18:36.157 --> 18:40.503

will light up like Christmas tree.</i>

20:12.837 --> 20:14.931
<i>Come on, hurry up!</i>

20:33.566 --> 20:35.864
<i>{man} That's right. We've got him.</i>

20:43.951 --> 20:46.045
<i>Excuse me. Shut it now.</i>

20:50.207 --> 20:52.301
<i>Thank you.</i>

21:48.224 --> 21:51.319
<i>Cheer up, Saunders.
The operation's a success.</i>

21:53.103 --> 21:58.325
<i>- And officially still yours.
- I don't intend to leave it at that, 007.</i>

21:58.984 --> 22:03.410
<i>I'm telling M you deliberately missed.
Your orders were to kill that sniper.</i>

22:03.489 --> 22:07.335
<i>Stuff my orders. I only kill professionals.</i>

22:07.409 --> 22:09.582
<i>That girl didn't know
one end of a rifle from the other.</i>

22:10.788 --> 22:14.793
<i>Go ahead. Tell M what you want.
If he fires me, I'll thank him for it.</i>

22:16.126 --> 22:19.926
<i>Whoever she was, I must have

<i>Assassination methods:
strangulation with hands or thighs.</i>

22:34.854 --> 22:36.948
<i>James, she's just your type!</i>

22:37.022 --> 22:39.366
<i>Wrong again, Moneypenny. You are.</i>

22:39.441 --> 22:42.365
<i>I'll file that
with the other secret information.</i>

22:42.528 --> 22:45.281
<i>Specialist - child impersonations.</i>

22:45.364 --> 22:49.585
<i>Assassination method:
explosive teddy bears.</i>

22:49.660 --> 22:52.163
<i>That's all the KGB female assassins.</i>

22:52.246 --> 22:56.752
<i>You know, we could try freelancers
stationed outside the Soviet bloc.</i>

22:56.834 --> 23:00.714
<i>It'll have to wait. M wants you
out at the Blayden safe house.</i>

23:01.839 --> 23:04.763
<i>Right. Looks like
it's a dead end here anyway.</i>

23:04.842 --> 23:06.936

23:22.776 --> 23:27.577
<i>Something we're making for
the Americans. It's called a ghetto blaster.</i>

23:28.657 --> 23:33.413
<i>You'd better hurry. M wants you
to stop at Harrods and pick up a parcel.</i>

23:34.705 --> 23:40.132
<i>Moneypenny, ask Records to monitor
Czech publication and news services</i>

23:40.210 --> 23:44.181

You'll have to leave the metal.</i>

<i>- Good morning, sir. May I help you?
- No, thanks.</i>

<i>James!</i>

<i>James, I will never forget
what you did for me!</i>

25:24.606 --> 25:26.700
<i>Thank you so... What's this?</i>

25:28.360 --> 25:32.160
<i>From Harrods. A godsend!
The food here is horrible.</i>

25:32.239 --> 25:35.243
<i>- The foie gras is excellent.
- Da, da. As Russians say,</i>

25:35.325 --> 25:39.080
<i>hearts and stomachs
good comrades make. {laughs}</i>

25:39.163 --> 25:44.169
<i>What's this? Caviar. Well, that's peasant
food for us, but with champagne it's OK.</i>

25:44.251 --> 25:48.677
<i>Bollinger RD. The best! Mm...</i>

25:48.756 --> 25:52.636
<i>The brand on the list was questionable,
sir, so I chose something else.</i>

25:52.718 --> 25:54.766
<i>Superb, Mr Bond!</i>

25:55.012 --> 25:57.390
<i>May I suggest we resume the debriefing?</i>

25:57.473 --> 25:59.851
<i>Absolutely. Go ahead. I'm all yours.</i>

26:05.147 --> 26:06.694

<i>- Where's the usual man?
- Huh... Flu.</i>

26:21.121 --> 26:24.341
<i>- Hey, mate. Watch it!
- Kitchen entrance, round the back.</i>

26:24.666 --> 26:28.842
<i>General Leonid Pushkin is why I defect.</i>

26:28.921 --> 26:32.425
<i>What? Your KGB superior?</i>

26:32.508 --> 26:35.808
<i>Gogol's replacement when
he joined their foreign service.</i>

26:35.886 --> 26:39.811
<i>Once we were like brothers,
but now he's a different man.</i>

26:39.890 --> 26:43.064
<i>Power has gone to his head.
He's sick, like Stalin!</i>

26:43.143 --> 26:45.987
<i>He hates our new policy of détente.</i>

26:50.150 --> 26:56.783
<i>I have here a secret directive
from Pushkin. Smiert Spionom.</i>

26:58.158 --> 27:00.456
<i>- "Death to Spies", Minister.
- Da.</i>

27:00.911 --> 27:05.917
<i>For an assassination programme, with list
of targets - British and American agents.</i>

27:06.834 --> 27:09.758
<i>When this starts, you will retaliate.</i>

27:09.837 --> 27:13.512
<i>Soviet and Western Intelligence
could destroy each other.</i>

27:13.590 --> 27:15.718
<i>This might lead to nuclear war!</i>

<i>Unless Pushkin can be... How do you say?</i>

27:20.347 --> 27:22.441
<i>Put away.</i>

27:24.101 --> 27:27.025
<i>- Where is Pushkin now? In Moscow?
- Da.</i>

27:27.104 --> 27:30.358
<i>But in three days he will leave for Tangier.</i>

27:30.440 --> 27:34.490
<i>Cover - North African trade convention.</i>

27:36.363 --> 27:38.616
<i>Real reason?</i>

27:38.699 --> 27:40.793
<i>New directive.</i>

27:43.871 --> 27:48.877
<i>Minister, in view of the importance
of what Mr Koskov has just told us</i>

27:48.959 --> 27:51.929
<i>I believe we should
consult with higher authority.</i>

27:52.254 --> 27:56.100
<i>- By all means. Good day, Mr Koskov.
- Good day, sir.</i>

28:02.514 --> 28:04.812
<i>There you go. There's a good lad.</i>

28:17.779 --> 28:21.079
<i>- Good morning.
- Morning. Put it down there, would you?</i>

<i>Green Four?</i>

31:58.834 --> 32:00.928
<i>- No trace of him?
- Nothing.</i>

32:01.002 --> 32:04.757
<i>- Then there's this Pushkin matter.
- Mm. Well, I must be off.</i>

32:05.298 --> 32:07.642
<i>Meeting with the PM this afternoon.</i>

32:10.804 --> 32:13.398
<i>We have to nip Smiert Spionom in the bud.</i>

32:15.183 --> 32:18.062
<i>Pushkin should be in Tangiers
in two days' time.</i>

32:18.562 --> 32:21.156
<i>A termination warrant
has been issued for him.</i>

32:21.231 --> 32:25.031
<i>This plot to kill agents
sounds rather far-fetched, sir.</i>

32:25.819 --> 32:28.322
<i>- I know General Pushkin
- Do you think I don't?</i>

32:28.405 --> 32:31.375
<i>I've dealt with him on several occasions!</i>

32:31.450 --> 32:36.877
<i>Our paths have crossed over the years.
He's tough and resourceful, but...</i>

32:36.955 --> 32:41.256
<i>- I can't believe he's a psychotic.
- Neither did I until today.</i>

32:41.334 --> 32:44.588
<i>This arrived from Gibraltar.
It was found near 004's body.</i>

32:50.093 --> 32:52.846
<i>Your name was on Pushkin's list, too, 007.</i>

32:56.725 --> 33:02.277
<i>There are a few things I'd like to check
out first, sir. That sniper, for instance.</i>

33:02.355 --> 33:06.155
<i>Yes... I've read Saunders' report
You jeopardised the mission</i>

33:06.234 --> 33:12.162
<i>- to avoid shooting a beautiful girl.
- I had to make a split-second decision.</i>

33:12.240 --> 33:14.959
<i>- It was instinct.
- I'll recall 008 from Hong Kong.</i>

33:15.035 --> 33:17.504
<i>He can do it. He doesn't know Pushkin.</i>

33:17.579 --> 33:20.833
<i>He follows orders, not instincts.</i>

33:21.208 --> 33:24.087
<i>- You can take a fortnight's leave.
- No!</i>

33:24.586 --> 33:26.680
<i>Sir.</i>

33:27.797 --> 33:32.519
<i>If it has to be done, I'd rather do it.</i>

33:35.639 --> 33:38.438
<i>Right, bring it down slowly. Gently now.</i>

33:38.517 --> 33:41.441
<i>- Morning, Q.
-Ah, morning, 007. Ow!</i>

33:41.520 --> 33:43.818
<i>Mind your head.</i>

33:43.897 --> 33:47.652
<i>I've got something for you.
We're just winterising this.</i>

33:50.362 --> 33:53.036
<i>Now, pay attention, 007.</i>

33:53.114 --> 33:56.744
<i>- A key-ring finder. {whistles}
- {bleeps}</i>

33:56.952 --> 34:00.673
<i>- Surprise me.
- You arm it by pressing that button there.</i>

34:00.747 --> 34:02.749
<i>Like that. See?</i>

34:04.334 --> 34:06.428
<i>Right. Now wear that.</i>

34:08.129 --> 34:11.804
<i>Right. Now... Whistle

<i>You don't find too many
normal people in this business, Q.</i>

34:36.116 --> 34:39.040
<i>What is it to blow up the room -
"God Save the Queen"?</i>

34:39.119 --> 34:44.091
<i>It so happens, 007, that we've packed
the finder with concentrated explosive,</i>

34:44.165 --> 34:46.634
<i>sufficient to remove the door of any safe.</i>

34:46.710 --> 34:51.216
<i>It's magnetic.
The actuating signal is personalised.</i>

34:51.297 --> 34:53.847
<i>- What's my code?
- Oh, most appropriate.</i>

34:54.092 --> 34:56.971
<i>- A wolf whistle.
- You mean, um...</i>

34:58.013 --> 35:00.107
<i>Stop!</i>

35:01.266 --> 35:03.644
<i>You may find the keys useful.</i>

35:04.603 --> 35:07.152
<i>They open 90% of the world's locks.</i>

35:09.941 --> 35:13.161
<i>All right, sit down and
make yourself comfortable.</i>

35:17.657 --> 35:21.753

<i>You're English. Who are you?</i>

40:30.303 --> 40:33.898
<i>I heard you play

40:37.852 --> 40:40.526

Where did they take you?</i>

40:47.153 --> 40:49.247
<i>KGB headquarters?</i>

40:50.782 --> 40:52.955
<i>They released me this morning.</i>

40:53.034 --> 40:54.707
<i>Take a look across the street.</i>

40:59.123 --> 41:00.875
<i>They let you go so they could follow you.</i>

41:07.924 --> 41:11.519
<i>I don't understand.
Why are you trying to help me?</i>

41:14.347 --> 41:15.439
<i>What did Pushkin want?</i>

41:17.308 --> 41:19.231
<i>Did he ask you about Georgi Koskov?</i>

41:24.190 --> 41:25.908
<i>He wanted to know where he was.</i>

41:26.359 --> 41:29.488
<i>- Did you tell him?
- No.</i>

41:29.570 --> 41:32.289
<i>That was clever of Georgi...using blanks.</i>

41:35.159 --> 41:38.663
<i>Made the British believe
his defection was real.</i>

41:38.746 --> 41:39.963
<i>How do you know that?</i>

41:41.082 --> 41:42.083
<i>He told me.</i>

41:43.584 --> 41:46.929
<i>- You saw him?
- Two days ago. He's safe and sound.</i>

41:49.298 --> 41:53.553
<i>- You're a friend of his?
- We've been through quite a lot together.</i>

41:53.720 --> 41:56.599
<i>Oh, dear Georgi!</i>

41:57.265 --> 41:59.893
<i>He kept his promise to send for me.</i>

42:01.185 --> 42:03.062
<i>Where are we going? To London?</i>

42:03.187 --> 42:07.988
<i>No, not yet. The British think
he'll be safer if he keeps moving around.</i>

42:08.067 --> 42:11.537
<i>- We might catch up with him in Vienna.
- Vienna?</i>

42:11.612 --> 42:15.458

42:15.533 --> 42:17.627

- We'll manage.</i>

42:17.702 --> 42:20.125
<i>Get packed. Bring some warm clothes.</i>

43:25.186 --> 43:27.689
<i>Looks like we got away with it.</i>

43:31.025 --> 43:33.744
<i>My cello! It's at the conservatoire.</i>

43:33.820 --> 43:37.120
<i>- I'll get you another in Vienna.
- No, we must go back for it.</i>

43:37.198 --> 43:40.668
<i>We have 10 minutes before
they discover what's happened.</i>

43:40.743 --> 43:43.667

<i>See where this leads to.</i>

<i>You'll return our deposit

53:12.898 --> 53:14.992
<i>You can't be serious, General.</i>

<i>Do you know how hard it is

53:18.070 --> 53:20.539
<i>This is the latest US and European stuff.</i>

53:20.614 --> 53:23.868
<i>I've made commitments,

<i>Spare me your military pretensions.
What army did you serve in?</i>

<i>You were expelled

53:49.643 --> 53:54.240

55:07.054 --> 55:09.933
<i>- Georgi got it in New York.
- Quite a present.</i>

55:10.390 --> 55:14.065
<i>Maybe someday I'll play there.
At Carnegie Hall?</i>

55:14.144 --> 55:17.819
<i>- Georgi believes I can do it.
- I'm sure he's right.</i>

55:19.024 --> 55:22.574
<i>- We go to him now?

55:23.821 --> 55:26.574

- Careful.</i>

56:22.045 --> 56:24.719
<i>Oh, good afternoon, Mr Bond.</i>

56:25.507 --> 56:29.137
<i>- You will need your usual suite?
- Not tonight, Hans.</i>

56:29.219 --> 56:31.313
<i>- We need a second bedroom.
- Yes, sir.</i>

56:31.388 --> 56:35.018
<i>- Shall I have vodka martinis sent up?
- Shaken, not stirred.</i>

56:35.100 --> 56:37.194
<i>Of course.</i>

56:43.483 --> 56:47.238
<i>Bond here. I need two tickets for the
opera tonight, to be left at the box office.</i>

57:02.127 --> 57:06.098
<i>- Do you like it?
- For princess or wife of commissar?</i>

57:06.173 --> 57:08.642
<i>- Let's buy it.
- Don't joke!</i>

57:08.717 --> 57:11.766
<i>- Who will pay?
- Georgi, of course.</i>

57:22.731 --> 57:25.655
<i>Mm... mmm...</i>

57:28.153 --> 57:30.247
<i>Please... Stop it.</i>

57:34.618 --> 57:36.712
<i>The chief wants you.</i>

57:48.131 --> 57:49.804
<i>Oh!</i>

57:51.718 --> 57:53.186
<i>We have to report.</i>

58:06.233 --> 58:08.531
<i>Very good. At ease, Sergeant.</i>

58:10.195 --> 58:12.289
<i>Pushkin wants the money back.</i>

58:13.365 --> 58:18.667
<i>Don't worry. We've convinced
the British that Pushkin is a danger.</i>

58:18.745 --> 58:22.966
<i>They will send their best man,
James Bond, to eliminate him.</i>

58:23.166 --> 58:25.885
<i>I'm not convinced. Necros can do it.</i>

58:25.961 --> 58:30.011
<i>I've worked with the Russians.
My appearance is well known to them.</i>

58:30.090 --> 58:33.515
<i>It could jeopardise my comrades
who depend upon me.</i>

58:33.593 --> 58:38.099
<i>And they depend upon me. Where else
will they find a supply of arms?</i>

58:38.181 --> 58:40.309
<i>Our basic plan is sound.</i>

58:40.392 --> 58:43.316
<i>Pushkin is... How you say... History.</i>

58:43.603 --> 58:46.231
<i>Not yet. James Bond
hasn't laid a finger on him.</i>

58:46.314 --> 58:48.442
<i>- The British are cautious.
- Yeah.</i>

58:48.775 --> 58:51.779
<i>An additional inducement will ensure this.</i>

58:51.862 --> 58:55.742
<i>For instance,
if another agent were... Eliminated...</i>

58:57.868 --> 59:01.964
<i>Do it. But if Pushkin is alive on
the last day of the conference, kill him!</i>

<i>- The KGB sniper? Why bring her here?
- She's not a KGB sniper.</i>

01:00:18.365 --> 01:00:21.335
<i>She's Koskov's girlfriend.</i>

01:00:21.409 --> 01:00:24.538
<i>She shot blanks to make
his defection look real to us.</i>

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:27.875
<i>Koskov's defection phoney?
The KGB snatched him back.</i>

01:00:27.958 --> 01:00:29.551
<i>That's what we were supposed to think.</i>

01:00:30.752 --> 01:00:35.553
<i>These are serious accusations, Bond.
What are you up to?</i>

01:00:35.632 --> 01:00:39.512
<i>I'm posing as Koskov's friend
to see what leads I can get from her.</i>

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:46.018
<i>You know he bought her a cello
in New York called the Lady Rose?</i>

01:00:46.101 --> 01:00:50.072
<i>- A cello with a name?
- Mm-hm. It's a Stradivarius.</i>

01:00:50.147 --> 01:00:52.400

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:55.110
<i>Where would Koskov get the money?
Check it out.</i>

01:00:55.193 --> 01:01:00.290
<i>I'll need papers for her... Tonight. I have
to get her out of the country by tomorrow.</i>

<i>Here. I took these this afternoon.</i>

01:01:04.452 --> 01:01:08.298
<i>Look, this is highly irregular.
I won't get the OK from London today.</i>

01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:14.130
<i>It can't wait, Saunders. That girl's
our only chance of getting Koskov back.</i>

Pushkin makes a miraculous recovery.</i>

<i>You mean this is a put-up job?</i>

01:16:41.347 --> 01:16:44.271

<i>Whitaker has a few samples of hi-tech

<i>He wants you dead. You knew too much.</i>

01:19:22.758 --> 01:19:26.604
<i>Liar! You pretended to love me!</i>

01:19:26.679 --> 01:19:31.936
<i>I telephoned Whitaker.
Georgi was there. He told me the truth.</i>

01:19:32.017 --> 01:19:35.521
<i>You're a KGB agent,
using me to find him and kill him!</i>

01:19:35.646 --> 01:19:37.523
<i>No, that's not...</i>

01:19:37.648 --> 01:19:39.696
<i>That's not true. I...</i>

01:19:42.778 --> 01:19:44.200
<i>That's. ..</i>

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:48.200
<i>Chloral hydrate!</i>

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:51.333
<i>- Keep your hands off me!
- Kara, listen to me!</i>

01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:56.717
<i>The riﬂe was shot out of your hands.</i>

01:19:56.792 --> 01:19:59.295
<i>- How do you know?
- Because I was the...</i>

01:20:00.462 --> 01:20:03.011
<i>I was the man sent to kill you.</i>

01:20:04.383 --> 01:20:05.430
<i>Why didn't you?</i>

01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:23.744
<i>Kara, my darling,
you were absolutely perfect.</i>

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:26.664
<i>L-luFFY</i>

01:20:26.989 --> 01:20:28.912
<i>{Siren}</i>

01:20:42.755 --> 01:20:44.849
<i>Sortez, s'iI vous plait.</i>

01:21:01.607 --> 01:21:03.701
<i>Merci, monsieur.</i>

01:21:11.283 --> 01:21:13.377
<i>Open it, please.</i>

01:21:14.787 --> 01:21:17.415
<i>Careful. It must be kept absolutely sterile.</i>

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:20.801
<i>Urgh! Go.</i>

01:22:13.971 --> 01:22:16.645
<i>I've been such a fool.</i>

01:22:17.808 --> 01:22:20.152
<i>We both have.</i>

01:22:20.227 --> 01:22:21.353
<i>Open the lid.</i>

01:22:22.438 --> 01:22:24.782
<i>{93393} Oh, my God!</i>

01:22:24.857 --> 01:22:26.905
<i>That's not human. It's an animal's heart.</i>

01:22:31.989 --> 01:22:35.038
<i>Diamonds hidden in the ice.</i>

<i>{toilet ﬂushes}</i>

01:22:38.996 --> 01:22:43.217

<i>She has so many talents!</i>

01:23:17.367 --> 01:23:18.835
<i>I'm curious.</i>

01:23:19.495 --> 01:23:22.920
<i>- Why didn't you kill me?
- Oh, I'm not a barbarian, James.</i>

01:23:22.998 --> 01:23:25.751
<i>I'm taking you
to the proper Soviet authorities</i>

01:23:25.876 --> 01:23:28.971
<i>for the killing of General Pushkin.</i>

01:23:32.257 --> 01:23:37.354
<i>You're a wonder, Georgi!
You get me to kill Pushkin for you.</i>

01:23:37.429 --> 01:23:39.397
<i>Then you turn me in
to the Russians for his murder.</i>

01:23:40.599 --> 01:23:44.274
<i>What are you going to ask for? Immunity?</i>

01:23:44.394 --> 01:23:47.364
<i>Permission to emigrate
and enjoy the amenities of the West?</i>

01:23:48.357 --> 01:23:51.361
<i>You don't think they'll
condone your defection?</i>

01:23:51.443 --> 01:23:53.116
<i>What defection?</i>

01:23:53.237 --> 01:23:56.537
<i>I have been on a secret mission
for General Pushkin</i>

01:23:56.615 --> 01:23:59.619
<i>to disinform British Intelligence.</i>

01:24:00.369 --> 01:24:03.794
<i>I'm sorry, James.
For you I have great affection,</i>

01:24:04.748 --> 01:24:09.254
<i>but we have an old saying:
"Duty has no sweethearts."</i>

01:24:11.129 --> 01:24:14.303
<i>We have an old saying, too, Georgi.</i>

01:24:14.424 --> 01:24:16.802
<i>And you're full of it!</i>

01:24:40.409 --> 01:24:42.503
<i>Come, Kara.</i>

01:24:53.088 --> 01:24:55.841
<i>- Kara?
- Yes.</i>

01:25:02.306 --> 01:25:03.853
<i>Welcome to Afghanistan.</i>

01:25:04.683 --> 01:25:07.527
<i>Colonel Feyador, my old comrade in arms.</i>

01:25:09.187 --> 01:25:15.365
<i>I have here General Pushkin's assassin.
British Agent O07, James Bond.</i>

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:18.618
<i>See he is sent to Moscow.</i>

01:25:18.697 --> 01:25:21.120
<i>One moment. There's one more.</i>

01:25:21.199 --> 01:25:24.373
<i>Take her, too. She's a defector.</i>

01:25:26.705 --> 01:25:28.799
<i>I will be compassionate with you</i>

01:25:28.874 --> 01:25:33.129
<i>and try to have you assigned to
the Siberian Philharmonic Orchestra.</i>

01:25:33.211 --> 01:25:36.715
<i>They're quite good
despite their bourgeois repertoire.</i>

01:25:44.681 --> 01:25:49.653
<i>I am on a secret state mission. I need
a detachment of men and some trucks.</i>

01:25:55.567 --> 01:25:58.571
<i>- Ah! What are these here for?
- For murder.</i>

01:25:58.695 --> 01:26:01.665
<i>Murder? Ah!</i>

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:05.665
<i>I haven't had a woman prisoner
for a long time!</i>

01:26:05.744 --> 01:26:07.872
<i>{laughter}</i>

01:26:09.331 --> 01:26:11.925
<i>Come.</i>

01:26:12.042 --> 01:26:15.091
<i>Russky! Has Colonel Feyador
considered my appeal?</i>

01:26:15.170 --> 01:26:17.172
<i>Yes. Good news.</i>

01:26:17.255 --> 01:26:20.600
<i>You won't be hung in the morning.
You will be shot!</i>

01:26:23.345 --> 01:26:25.768
<i>It's all a mistake! I stole nothing!</i>

01:26:25.847 --> 01:26:28.350
<i>You can tell Allah when you see him!</i>

01:26:31.269 --> 01:26:34.694
<i>- Strip!
- Nye smeyete menya trogat!</i>

01:26:34.773 --> 01:26:39.199
<i>Shout all you want. It's soundproofed.
They don't like to hear screaming at night.</i>

01:26:41.446 --> 01:26:42.993
<i>I didn't tell you to get down!</i>

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:49.458
<i>I did not tell you to get up!</i>

01:26:49.579 --> 01:26:51.627
<i>Now... Get up!</i>

<i>Lock the door.</i>

01:28:20.295 --> 01:28:23.174
<i>You were fantastic! We're free!</i>

01:28:23.799 --> 01:28:29.306
<i>Kara, we're in a Russian air base in the
middle of Afghanistan. Try the small key.</i>

01:28:33.391 --> 01:28:34.893
<i>At least we're together.</i>

01:28:35.727 --> 01:28:37.821
<i>Terrific. Come on.</i>

01:28:45.904 --> 01:28:48.157
<i>Please.</i>

<i>{shouts in Afghan}</i>

01:30:42.687 --> 01:30:45.190
<i>- What's going on?
- I tell them you no Russian.</i>

01:30:45.315 --> 01:30:47.693
<i>- They no kill you now.
- How about later?</i>

01:30:47.817 --> 01:30:51.538
<i>Don't worry. They'll save you for the harem!</i>

01:31:13.843 --> 01:31:16.221
<i>It's the work of the mujaheddin.</i>

01:31:16.346 --> 01:31:18.064
<i>Mujaheddin?</i>

01:31:18.139 --> 01:31:20.233
<i>The Afghan Resistance.</i>

01:31:24.813 --> 01:31:26.907

<i>I hope he's not invited to dinner.</i>

01:33:26.684 --> 01:33:31.611
<i>{English accent} Thank you both
for your help. My name is Kamran Shah.</i>

01:33:31.689 --> 01:33:36.365
<i>Please forgive the theatricals.
It's a hangover from my Oxford days.</i>

01:33:36.486 --> 01:33:38.659
<i>I'm sure you'd like to freshen up.</i>

01:33:40.615 --> 01:33:42.709
<i>It's all right, go ahead.</i>

01:33:51.835 --> 01:33:56.056
<i>- I have to get back to the air base.
- {laughs} You must be crazy!</i>

01:33:56.131 --> 01:34:00.557
<i>- Half the Russian army's looking for you!
- You won't help?</i>

01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:03.138
<i>No.</i>

01:34:03.221 --> 01:34:05.565
<i>Then put me in touch with the mujaheddin.</i>

01:34:05.682 --> 01:34:08.185
<i>{laughter}</i>

01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:12.647
<i>Deputy Commander of the Eastern District.</i>

01:34:12.730 --> 01:34:19.079
<i>I was caught reconnoitring the air base.
Thankfully they didn't know who I was.</i>

01:34:19.154 --> 01:34:21.657
<i>Now, who are you?</i>

01:34:22.157 --> 01:34:25.832
<i>- I work for the British government.
- {laughter}</i>

01:34:27.579 --> 01:34:30.048
<i>We've uncovered a plot by General Koskov</i>

01:34:30.456 --> 01:34:32.550
<i>to purchase American hi-tech weapons.</i>

01:34:33.501 --> 01:34:35.378
<i>Arms that could be used
against you and your men.</i>

01:34:37.505 --> 01:34:41.601
<i>That is important. You must go to
our commander in the Khyber Pass.</i>

01:34:41.676 --> 01:34:45.601
<i>That could take days. I have to get back
to the air base before Koskov leaves.</i>

01:34:46.764 --> 01:34:50.769
<i>Look, come with us tomorrow.
After our mission, I'll see what I can do.</i>

01:34:50.894 --> 01:34:52.942
<i>That'll be too late.</i>

01:34:54.564 --> 01:34:57.192
<i>- I need a gun and some guides.
- Impossible.</i>

01:34:57.275 --> 01:35:00.028
<i>I cannot spare men or the horses.</i>

01:35:00.111 --> 01:35:04.287
<i>And now it is time to rest.
We leave at sunrise.</i>

01:35:18.546 --> 01:35:20.640
<i>I was worried for you, James.</i>

01:35:24.135 --> 01:35:26.263
<i>What's going to happen to us?</i>

01:35:29.641 --> 01:35:31.109
<i>Kheista.</i>

01:35:32.477 --> 01:35:33.478
<i>What does that mean?</i>

01:35:36.397 --> 01:35:38.991
<i>It means beautiful...in Afghan.</i>

01:35:43.571 --> 01:35:46.415
<i>We're with the mujaheddin.</i>

01:35:46.491 --> 01:35:50.337
<i>We leave with them in the morning
on some kind of operation.</i>

01:35:50.411 --> 01:35:52.755
<i>And you're going to the Khyber Pass.</i>

01:35:52.830 --> 01:35:53.831
<i>You're not coming with me?</i>

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.425
<i>No. I'll catch up with you later.</i>

01:35:59.504 --> 01:36:02.178
<i>You're going back for Georgi, aren't you?</i>

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:06.845
<i>- It's too dangerous. Don't go.
- I have to.</i>

01:36:06.928 --> 01:36:10.148
<i>You have to what? Get killed?</i>

01:36:11.182 --> 01:36:14.026
<i>- I won't wait for you.
- Fine.</i>

01:36:14.143 --> 01:36:16.020
<i>Then I'll have Kamran
send you direct to London.</i>

01:36:17.188 --> 01:36:21.284
<i>You dumb, stubborn, stupid...</i>

01:36:23.361 --> 01:36:25.363
<i>Konska zadnice!</i>

01:36:27.865 --> 01:36:31.711
<i>- What's that supposed to mean?
- Back end of horse!</i>

01:36:31.995 --> 01:36:34.214
<i>Are you calling me a horse's arse?</i>

01:36:46.843 --> 01:36:48.595
<i>I might never see you again.</i>

01:36:52.473 --> 01:36:54.396
<i>You will.</i>

01:36:54.517 --> 01:36:56.565
<i>I promise.</i>

01:37:48.404 --> 01:37:50.452
<i>{shouting in Afghan}</i>

01:38:43.835 --> 01:38:47.590

<i>{Qunfi re}</i>

01:39:02.353 --> 01:39:05.857
<i>- What are you up to? Selling dope?
- Not so loud.</i>

01:39:06.274 --> 01:39:08.777
<i>- That's the chief of the Snow Leopards.
- Who?</i>

01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:13.115
<i>- The biggest opium dealer in the area.
- I've worked for them.</i>

01:39:13.197 --> 01:39:16.622
<i>I don't care if the Russians die
from my bullets or their opium!</i>

01:39:17.034 --> 01:39:19.457
<i>Besides, we need the money to buy arms.</i>

01:39:22.123 --> 01:39:24.797
<i>- Georgi!
- And the diamonds.</i>

01:39:26.544 --> 01:39:29.889
<i>He arranged for the Russians
to buy many hi-tech weapons.</i>

01:39:30.006 --> 01:39:32.350
<i>He's using the down payment
to buy this opium instead.</i>

01:39:33.342 --> 01:39:38.644
<i>He can turn a huge profit in days and
still provide the Russians with their arms.</i>

01:39:38.723 --> 01:39:41.192
<i>- Unless...
- Go on.</i>

01:39:42.226 --> 01:39:44.069
<i>If the opium never arrives...</i>

01:39:44.145 --> 01:39:46.694
<i>The Snow Leopard Brotherhood
are dangerous to cross.</i>

01:39:47.482 --> 01:39:49.735
<i>This is their biggest deal since the invasion.</i>

01:39:50.067 --> 01:39:52.320
<i>You won't help?</i>

<i>{shouts in Afghan}</i>

01:39:54.864 --> 01:39:59.335
<i>Perhaps. As long as nothing is done
till the Russians pay up and leave.</i>

01:39:59.827 --> 01:40:02.831
<i>Right. I'll need
some plastic explosives and a timer.</i>

01:40:02.914 --> 01:40:05.042
<i>I'll see what I can do.</i>

01:50:21.698 --> 01:50:24.372
<i>{Qunfi re}</i>

01:50:25.536 --> 01:50:28.665
<i>Don't shoot! You'll hit the plane!</i>

01:51:16.211 --> 01:51:17.884
<i>- Kara!
- Oh, my God!</i>

01:51:22.342 --> 01:51:23.935
<i>Jump!</i>

01:51:56.251 --> 01:51:58.379
<i>Now that you're here, take over.</i>

01:51:58.462 --> 01:52:02.137
<i>- What?
- Hold this and keep it straight and level.</i>

01:52:02.257 --> 01:52:04.134
<i>- Where are you going?
- To defuse a bomb.</i>

01:55:12.781 --> 01:55:14.499
<i>No!</i>

01:55:15.826 --> 01:55:16.998
<i>Please!</i>

01:56:08.879 --> 01:56:10.973
<i>{bomb ticking}</i>

01:56:34.237 --> 01:56:37.161
<i>- What happened?
- He got the boot.</i>

01:56:37.908 --> 01:56:39.581
<i>{screams}</i>

01:57:27.457 --> 01:57:30.131
<i>{shouts in Afghan}</i>

01:57:35.131 --> 01:57:36.974
<i>Take over. Hold it steady.</i>

01:57:37.092 --> 01:57:39.641
<i>- Where are you going?
- To drop a bomb.</i>

01:58:38.653 --> 01:58:41.202
<i>{beeping}</i>

01:58:49.873 --> 01:58:51.295
<i>What's the matter?</i>

01:58:52.917 --> 01:58:55.045
<i>We're losing fuel fast!</i>

01:59:05.764 --> 01:59:09.064
<i>I just hope we can make Pakistan.</i>

01:59:31.081 --> 01:59:33.960
<i>There's no place to put down.</i>

01:59:34.084 --> 01:59:36.928
<i>{buzzer sounds}</i>

01:59:37.003 --> 01:59:39.597
<i>Go in the back. Get in the Jeep. Quickly!</i>

01:59:55.522 --> 01:59:57.820
<i>Fasten your seat belt!</i>

02:00:09.953 --> 02:00:11.125
<i>Hold on!</i>

02:00:32.684 --> 02:00:36.985
<i>I know a great restaurant in Karachi.
We can just make dinner!</i>

02:00:45.822 --> 02:00:47.824
<i>{call to prayer}</i>

02:00:50.034 --> 02:00:54.255
<i>Whitaker's on the ground ﬂoor.
Koskov is in an upstairs bedroom.</i>

02:00:54.330 --> 02:00:56.674
<i>Guard in the pool area near you.</i>

02:00:58.543 --> 02:00:59.669
<i>Guard clear. Proceed.</i>

02:01:07.343 --> 02:01:09.016
<i>Hold it.</i>

02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:11.477
<i>He's coming back.</i>

02:01:15.435 --> 02:01:18.063
<i>Go, James. Over and out.</i>

02:01:18.438 --> 02:01:20.691
<i>Well, he's in.</i>

02:01:21.858 --> 02:01:23.906
<i>{explosions}</i>

02:01:45.131 --> 02:01:49.261
<i>Pickett's charge was up
Cemetery Ridge, not Little Round Top.</i>

02:01:49.385 --> 02:01:52.810
<i>I'm replaying the battle
as I would have fought it.</i>

02:01:52.889 --> 02:01:55.563
<i>Meade was tenacious but he was cautious.</i>

02:01:55.642 --> 02:01:58.612
<i>He missed his chances
to crush Lee at Gettysburg.</i>

02:01:58.728 --> 02:02:00.776
<i>I've come for Koskov.</i>

02:02:02.941 --> 02:02:07.242
<i>Well, hell, you can have him!
Soon as I get my opium.</i>

02:02:07.320 --> 02:02:10.665
<i>- Now where is it?
- Up in smoke.</i>

02:02:11.741 --> 02:02:14.915
<i>- You burned up a half a billion bucks?
- Mm-hm.</i>

02:02:17.914 --> 02:02:20.292
<i>That's too bad, Bond.</i>

02:02:20.416 --> 02:02:23.920
<i>You know, you could have been a live,
rich man instead of a poor, dead one.</i>

02:02:25.255 --> 02:02:30.352
<i>You're finished, Whitaker. If the Russians
don't get you, the Americans will.</i>

02:02:30.593 --> 02:02:32.641
<i>Nah.</i>

02:02:32.762 --> 02:02:36.983
<i>You know, Meade should have
taken another 35,000 casualties.</i>

02:02:37.767 --> 02:02:40.145
<i>He could have ended
the rebellion right then.</i>

02:02:40.270 --> 02:02:41.442
<i>Hell, Grant would have done it.</i>

02:03:10.884 --> 02:03:14.138
<i>Right, you've had your eight.
Now I'll have my 80!</i>

02:03:19.392 --> 02:03:23.522
<i>Sorry to say your popgun is no match
for the latest body armour!</i>

02:03:31.321 --> 02:03:33.369
<i>{remote control beeps}</i>

02:03:53.676 --> 02:03:59.729
<i>Should have known you'd take refuge
behind that British vulture Wellington!</i>

02:04:02.852 --> 02:04:08.109
<i>You know he had to buy German
mercenaries to beat Napoleon, don't you?</i>

02:04:08.191 --> 02:04:10.034
<i>{wolf-whistles}</i>

02:04:31.464 --> 02:04:33.558
<i>I owed you that one, Bond.</i>

02:04:37.595 --> 02:04:39.017
<i>He met his Waterloo.</i>

02:04:44.727 --> 02:04:46.570
<i>General Pushkin!</i>

02:04:47.730 --> 02:04:49.778
<i>Thank God you're still alive!</i>

02:04:52.652 --> 02:04:58.455
<i>Whitaker has held me here for weeks.
Thank you for rescuing me! Thank you!</i>

02:05:00.326 --> 02:05:02.829
<i>Georgi! Georgi!</i>

02:05:06.082 --> 02:05:09.632
<i>- Put him on the next plane to Moscow.
- Oh, thank you, General!</i>

02:05:09.752 --> 02:05:11.971
<i>Thank you so much! Thank you!</i>

02:05:12.088 --> 02:05:13.806
<i>In the diplomatic bag.</i>

02:05:21.931 --> 02:05:23.854
<i>What about Kara?</i>

02:05:23.933 --> 02:05:26.027
<i>She is a defector, too.</i>

02:05:27.311 --> 02:05:29.439
<i>What shall we do about her?</i>

02:05:31.858 --> 02:05:33.860
<i>{Dvorék "Cello Concerto "}</i>

02:06:27.497 --> 02:06:30.376
<i>Are you going to stay in France now?</i>

02:06:31.834 --> 02:06:34.587
<i>Oh, you were marvellous!</i>

02:06:35.713 --> 02:06:37.841
<i>Will you excuse us?</i>

02:06:41.844 --> 02:06:44.222
<i>General Gogol, Miss Kara Milovy.</i>

02:06:45.848 --> 02:06:51.526
<i>Magnificent! I hope you can find time
to play in Moscow very soon.</i>

02:06:51.604 --> 02:06:54.608
<i>It's all right. General Gogol
is with their foreign service.</i>

02:06:55.024 --> 02:06:59.825
<i>He's arranged an immigration visa,
so you can come and go as you like.</i>

02:06:59.904 --> 02:07:02.032
<i>Wonderful!</i>

02:07:06.077 --> 02:07:07.203
<i>Excuse me.</i>

02:07:09.413 --> 02:07:13.384
<i>I'm sorry we missed the concert.
We had some trouble at the airport.</i>

02:07:13.459 --> 02:07:18.056
<i>I can't imagine why! General Gogol,
I don't believe you've met Kamran Shah.</i>

02:07:18.548 --> 02:07:20.221
<i>- My pleasure.
- Where's James?</i>

02:07:21.300 --> 02:07:26.477
<i>- Unhappily, he's on assignment abroad.
- I'll be with you shortly.</i>

02:07:47.243 --> 02:07:49.666
<i>- {whistles}
- {key ring beeps}</i>

02:07:49.745 --> 02:07:52.339
<i>- {Bond whistles}

02:07:52.415 --> 02:07:55.259
<i>- {whistles}
- {key ring beeps}</i>

02:07:57.086 --> 02:08:00.511
<i>You didn't think I'd miss
this performance, did you?</i>

02:08:12.435 --> 02:08:13.687
<i>Oh, James.</i>

02:08:14.103 --> 02:08:19.860
<i>If there was a man I could dream of</i>

02:08:20.109 --> 02:08:26.958
<i>I'd dream about a dream come true</i>

02:08:27.617 --> 02:08:33.499
<i>If there was a man I could ever love</i>

02:08:33.789 --> 02:08:37.214
<i>I'd wait a million years</i>

02:08:37.293 --> 02:08:41.014
<i>For someone just like you</i>

02:08:41.923 --> 02:08:48.477
<i>All my life I've been belated</i>

02:08:48.763 --> 02:08:51.937
<i>Never taken any chances</i>

02:08:52.016 --> 02:08:55.361
<i>Always hesitated</i>

02:08:55.645 --> 02:08:58.740
<i>Where's the prayer?</i>

02:08:58.981 --> 02:09:02.235
<i>Where's the glory?</i>

02:09:02.485 --> 02:09:05.910
<i>Where's the one I'm holding out for?</i>

02:09:05.988 --> 02:09:09.788
<i>When's he walking through the door</i>

02:09:09.867 --> 02:09:15.044
<i>The one that you walked through</i>

02:09:15.122 --> 02:09:24.054
<i>If he isn't you?</i>

02:09:26.050 --> 02:09:32.183
<i>If there was a man I could dream of</i>

02:09:32.265 --> 02:09:39.114
<i>I'd dream about a dream come true</i>

02:09:39.730 --> 02:09:45.954
<i>If there was a man I could ever love</i>

02:09:46.028 --> 02:09:49.453
<i>I'd wait a million years</i>

02:09:49.532 --> 02:09:53.753
<i>For someone just like you</i>

02:09:54.036 --> 02:09:57.461
<i>Happy endings</i>

02:09:57.540 --> 02:10:00.965
<i>Never ﬁnd me</i>

02:10:01.043 --> 02:10:03.671
<i>I've put all my fantasies</i>

02:10:03.754 --> 02:10:07.759
<i>And hopes of love behind me</i>

02:10:07.842 --> 02:10:14.646
<i>Saw my moments over, doomed, but</i>

02:10:14.724 --> 02:10:19.400
<i>If there was a man out there for me</i>

02:10:19.478 --> 02:10:27.238
<i>I wish it would be
someone who could love me too</i>

02:10:27.320 --> 02:10:35.876
<i>If someone was you</i>
