WEBVTT

01:09.575 --> 01:11.575
Mm-hmm.

01:13.379 --> 01:16.113
A little bit
of magic time.

01:16.115 --> 01:18.082
I feel it.

01:22.154 --> 01:24.088
Yes, sir.

01:29.829 --> 01:34.598
Terrific shot !
I'm in the goddamn woods again.

01:34.600 --> 01:36.600
Goddamn.

01:39.238 --> 01:41.238
Damn game.

01:45.377 --> 01:47.878
I spend more time in the trees
than the squirrels.

01:56.288 --> 01:59.189
Wizard Two ?
Why not ?

02:03.762 --> 02:06.396
Uh-oh.

02:06.398 --> 02:09.399
Not again.

02:09.401 --> 02:14.138
I've had five heart attacks
in the last ten years.

02:14.140 --> 02:17.407
My first was on a golf course
in South Carolina.

02:17.409 --> 02:19.776
It wasn't all that bad.

02:19.778 --> 02:24.414
A couple of doglegs that were
more dog than leg, but I-I'd--
all in all, it was playable.

02:24.416 --> 02:28.185
Assuming, of course,
you didn't die
on the second hole.

02:28.187 --> 02:31.855
The second coronary
was at Augusta,
where they had the Masters.

02:31.857 --> 02:34.458
Went down right
on the first fairway.

02:34.460 --> 02:38.862
It was a good thing, too, 'cause
those greens probably would have
been the end of me anyway.

02:38.864 --> 02:42.332
My wife used to ask me,
before she passed on,

02:42.334 --> 02:46.303
why do I play a game
that seems destined to kill me ?

02:46.305 --> 02:50.207
It all started
back in 19 and 28...

02:50.209 --> 02:53.310
when I was just a youngster
in Savannah, Georgia.

03:00.819 --> 03:03.320
Jones and Hagen are
really goin' at it.

03:03.322 --> 03:06.490
They're like neck-and-neck
all the time.
Nuts.

03:06.492 --> 03:10.527
Was it 350 ?
Nah.
More like 400 with the roll.

03:10.529 --> 03:12.596
I don't care how good
Jones and Hagen are.

03:12.598 --> 03:15.232
Junuh could've beat 'em both
with his eyes closed.

03:15.234 --> 03:17.401
Junuh won that thing
three times in a row.

03:17.403 --> 03:20.204
Now when I was growin' up,
every town had its heroes,

03:20.206 --> 03:24.908
and ours was Rannulph Junuh,
an athlete who was
a born winner.

03:24.910 --> 03:28.412
Well, I wanted to be
just like him.

03:44.530 --> 03:49.466
Ladies and gentlemen,
Junuh has the most difficult
shot in the history of golf.

03:49.468 --> 03:52.903
He must sink this shot
from 110 yards
to win the championship.

03:52.905 --> 03:55.305
He steps up to the ball.

03:55.307 --> 03:57.574
The crowd is hushed
in anticipation.

03:57.576 --> 04:01.578
Can he make this miracle shot ?
And he swings !

04:01.580 --> 04:05.315
Fore !
Watch your heads !

04:14.593 --> 04:18.562
Now I'd
never seen him play myself,
since it was before I was born,

04:18.564 --> 04:22.532
but it was said that Junuh
had been on track to becomin'
the greatest golfer...

04:22.534 --> 04:24.601
this country
had ever seen.

04:24.603 --> 04:27.371
Titanic off the tee.

04:27.373 --> 04:30.841
Approach shots
which fell to earth,
as Sam Snead once put it,

04:30.843 --> 04:34.478
"like a butterfly
with sore feet."

04:34.480 --> 04:36.480
He won just about everything.

04:36.482 --> 04:40.617
But even he was the first
to say that his most
significant victory...

04:40.619 --> 04:43.587
was winnin' the heart
of Adele Invergordon,

04:43.589 --> 04:46.823
daughter of
the wealthiest man in Savannah.

04:49.561 --> 04:52.896
¶¶

05:40.612 --> 05:43.547
But fate plays funny tricks.

05:43.549 --> 05:47.484
¶ The Yanks are coming
The drums rum-tumming
everywhere ¶

05:47.486 --> 05:52.122
It was a patriotic
call to arms to fight
"the war to end all wars."

05:53.892 --> 05:57.527
Junuh and everyone else in town
believed it was his destiny...

05:57.529 --> 06:00.597
to lead the young men
of Savannah into battle.

06:00.599 --> 06:03.600
¶ Till it's over
over there ¶¶

06:03.602 --> 06:06.603
¶ How ya gonna keep 'em
away from Broadway ¶

06:06.605 --> 06:08.805
¶ Jazzin' around ¶¶

06:08.807 --> 06:12.576
It was to be
his crowning glory.

06:12.578 --> 06:15.612
But nothing could have
prepared him or anyone...

06:15.614 --> 06:19.416
for the shock and sorrow
of what was to come.

06:22.421 --> 06:25.455
Positions.
Get ready.
Ready, Captain.

06:25.457 --> 06:27.624
Positions.
Prepare to advance.
Ready, sir.

06:29.962 --> 06:31.962
Advance !

06:31.964 --> 06:34.531
Advance !

07:36.628 --> 07:39.863
Confused, broken...

07:39.865 --> 07:43.633
and unable to face a return
to a hero's welcome,

07:45.070 --> 07:47.637
Junuh just disappeared,

07:51.877 --> 07:54.110
hopin' to forget...

07:55.147 --> 07:57.614
and to be forgotten.

07:59.618 --> 08:02.018
But Adele,
bein' a woman of the South,

08:02.020 --> 08:05.622
had survived
worse than desertion.

08:05.624 --> 08:08.625
And she moved on
with her life,

08:08.627 --> 08:11.094
dedicatin' herself
to her father's dream.

08:11.096 --> 08:14.631
What we have here is
the most magnificent golf resort
on the face of God's good earth,

08:14.633 --> 08:16.867
and I am buildin' it
right here in Savannah.

08:16.869 --> 08:20.904
Krewe Island, legacy
to my sweet Adele.

08:20.906 --> 08:24.007
And we'd like to use all of you
as our main suppliers.

08:51.937 --> 08:55.605
I was ten years old
when Junuh came home.

09:07.619 --> 09:09.619
Stop !

09:48.660 --> 09:52.295
Less than a year later,
the Great Depression
that swept the nation...

09:52.297 --> 09:54.998
hit Savannah.

10:02.107 --> 10:06.009
Jobs were lost, stores
and banks were shut for good.

10:08.013 --> 10:12.282
And John Invergordon,
havin' spent his last dime
on his great dream,

10:12.284 --> 10:17.220
opened Krewe Island
on what should have been
a glorious spring day.

10:17.222 --> 10:21.157
<i> ¶¶</i>

10:39.111 --> 10:44.981
¶ My consolation when blue ¶

10:44.983 --> 10:49.152
¶ So just supposing that you ¶¶

10:51.723 --> 10:54.724
<i>It might not
have been a shot heard
round the world,
 Oh, Daddy !</i>

10:54.726 --> 10:58.895
but it sure reached every nook
and cranny in Savannah.

11:06.071 --> 11:09.973
I'll be putting some doors
and closets in the parlor.

11:09.975 --> 11:13.677
With any luck,
we could have some boarders
within a few weeks.

11:13.679 --> 11:16.346
Hardy, you think you
can share your room
with Cara Mae ?

11:18.150 --> 11:20.083
What about
the store ?

11:32.097 --> 11:35.965
<i> ¶¶</i>

12:13.004 --> 12:15.505
Oh, Jesus.

12:15.507 --> 12:19.142
I've died
and gone to hell.

12:21.279 --> 12:23.213
It's not as though
you got a choice, Adele.

12:23.215 --> 12:26.015
Your Krewe Island
golf resort
is dead and gone.

12:26.017 --> 12:30.420
You've got the gumption
of a corn fritter, Neskaloosa.
My gumption is not the subject.

12:30.422 --> 12:33.456
Well, then what is the subject,
gentlemen ?  Huh ?

12:33.458 --> 12:37.127
If it's your offer to take
Krewe Island for one-tenth
of what my father spent--

12:37.129 --> 12:39.963
You are lucky to be gettin'
a dime on the dollar, Adele.

12:39.965 --> 12:42.365
Just so you gentlemen can turn
right around and resell it...

12:42.367 --> 12:45.902
to some Carolina paper mill
for a tidy profit ?

12:45.904 --> 12:49.439
The fact that you've most likely
got the deal in your pocket
already is not my problem.

12:49.441 --> 12:52.308
Maybe we should come back
when the shock of your
father's passing...

12:52.310 --> 12:55.278
isn't so-- so--
Oh, God.

12:55.280 --> 12:57.447
Don't bother.
I'm not sellin'.

12:57.449 --> 13:01.451
You got a stack of debts
that'd fill every storage bay
in the Cotton Exchange--

13:01.453 --> 13:03.453
And I intend
to pay them off.

13:03.455 --> 13:06.122
- In time.
- With what ?  Ball tokens ?

13:06.124 --> 13:09.959
With money people gonna spend
once they know that this is
the premier resort in the South.

13:09.961 --> 13:14.297
Did I miss somethin' ?  Did I ?
Or are we not in the midst
of a great depression ?

13:14.299 --> 13:17.500
There's still people with money,
Neskaloosa, and I'm gonna make
sure they know about Krewe.

13:17.502 --> 13:21.171
But how exactly do you
intend to accomplish that ?

13:21.173 --> 13:23.339
- How ?
- Well, how ?

13:23.341 --> 13:26.109
How ?
I'll tell you how.

13:32.417 --> 13:35.318
I'm gonna have the greatest
exhibition match ever held...

13:35.320 --> 13:39.322
on the greatest
golf course ever built.

13:39.324 --> 13:42.058
- Bobby Jones...
- Bobby Jones ?

13:42.060 --> 13:44.360
-will be playin' Walter Hagen...
-Walter Hagen ?

13:44.362 --> 13:48.031
-for the grand prize of $10,000.
-$10,000 ?

13:48.033 --> 13:50.466
You can't be serious, Adele.
$10,000 for
one weekend ?

13:50.468 --> 13:53.369
Well,

13:53.371 --> 13:56.239
I'd make it more,
gentlemen,

13:56.241 --> 13:58.508
but that's just about
all I believe I can raise...

13:58.510 --> 14:00.510
if I sell
everything I own...

14:00.512 --> 14:03.112
on this earth.

14:03.114 --> 14:05.114
Except, of course,
Krewe Island.

14:05.116 --> 14:07.517
Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen
are comin' to Krewe Island ?

14:07.519 --> 14:10.119
Playin' an exhibition
match for ten grand ?

14:10.121 --> 14:12.322
That's correct.

14:12.324 --> 14:16.025
They don't know it yet,
but that's exactly
what they'll be doin'.

14:16.027 --> 14:18.394
Have you gone totally
off your rocker ?

14:18.396 --> 14:23.533
Nobody has the right
to call Krewe Island
"Invergordon's Folly."

14:23.535 --> 14:26.436
Nobody.
Good day, gentlemen.

14:29.407 --> 14:32.408
Adele !

14:32.410 --> 14:37.547
Nobody holds your father
responsible for this
depression, Adele !

14:40.518 --> 14:42.552
You're a damn fool,
Adele !

14:42.554 --> 14:45.288
Save your breath, Judge.
She'll sell to us.

14:45.290 --> 14:49.259
You really think Bobby Jones
and Walter Hagen are gonna
come to Krewe Island...

14:49.261 --> 14:52.028
just 'cause Adele Invergordon
wants 'em to ?

14:58.503 --> 15:02.272
All four golf championships
in a single year.

15:02.274 --> 15:05.508
The Grand Slam.
Simply amazing.

15:05.510 --> 15:08.411
I don't believe that's
ever been done before in
the history of golf, has it ?

15:08.413 --> 15:10.413
Well, no, it, uh--
It, uh--

15:10.415 --> 15:12.615
It just takes
my breath away.

15:12.617 --> 15:17.120
You don't impress me as someone
who tends to lose her breath,
Miss Invergordon.

15:17.122 --> 15:20.023
Did you know, Mr. Jones, that
reprobate Mr. Walter Hagen--

15:20.025 --> 15:24.227
who I hear spends his every
minute chasin' after women--

15:24.229 --> 15:27.497
has been approached about
playin' in next's month's
$10,000 Krewe Island match ?

15:27.499 --> 15:29.599
<i> No, I didn't.</i>

15:29.601 --> 15:33.536
But I'm not clear how
this is an urgent matter
for the American Red Cross.

15:33.538 --> 15:37.140
- Did I say that ?
- At the front door.

15:37.142 --> 15:40.510
May I speak candidly,
Mr. Jones ?

15:40.512 --> 15:43.046
I wish you would.

15:43.048 --> 15:48.351
I've come here today to see you
because to the South,
you are a hero.

15:48.353 --> 15:51.154
They see you
as a young god:

15:51.156 --> 15:54.991
brave, valiant,
glorious.

15:54.993 --> 15:58.428
One of the greatest golfers
in the world today.

15:58.430 --> 16:01.164
<i>I would say the greatest golfer
in the world today...</i>

16:01.166 --> 16:04.734
were it not for that unfortunate
incident last year when that
profligate, Mr. Hagen,

16:04.736 --> 16:09.238
whupped you by 12 strokes
on your very own course.

16:11.142 --> 16:13.509
You say he's been
invited to play at
Krewe Island next month ?

16:25.023 --> 16:27.523
She has a remarkable talent,
Mr. Hagen.

16:27.525 --> 16:29.993
I was the one
who hit the ball.

16:31.997 --> 16:36.199
I wonder if you might excuse us
for just a couple of minutes,
Anna Mae ?

16:37.302 --> 16:39.535
It won't be long.

16:39.537 --> 16:44.474
A charming woman, Mr. Hagen.
Although she gave me quite
a fright for a moment there.

16:44.476 --> 16:48.244
With so much weight distributed
in front, I'd have sworn she'd
topple back to the floor...

16:48.246 --> 16:50.780
before she ever
got to her knees.

16:50.782 --> 16:54.384
I do admire
a man with your...

16:54.386 --> 16:56.486
vitality.
Oh ?

16:56.488 --> 17:01.524
The South is in such
an unfortunate place these days,
and Savannah most of all.

17:01.526 --> 17:05.094
The memories of our disastrous
defeat in the War Between
the States still linger,

17:05.096 --> 17:08.765
and with them, the defeated,
uncertain men who returned
lacking the vigor...

17:08.767 --> 17:12.234
we woman normally associate
with your gender.
Hmm.

17:12.237 --> 17:14.303
And now, sadly,
here is Savannah,

17:14.305 --> 17:17.140
teeming with the most
attractive young women,

17:17.142 --> 17:19.308
and nobody,
absolutely nobody...

17:19.310 --> 17:21.511
to satisfy them.
Hmm.

17:21.512 --> 17:25.381
Except for, perhaps,
Bobby Jones, who will be playing
in our Krewe Island tournament.

17:28.118 --> 17:31.387
So he says, "It don't matter what it is.
 It won't hurt you.

17:31.389 --> 17:34.457
You just pop one
in your mouth,
and you chew !"

17:37.562 --> 17:40.563
I'm pleased to announce
that Mr. Bobby Jones
and Mr. Walter Hagen...

17:40.565 --> 17:43.733
have accepted
my golfin' invitation,

17:43.735 --> 17:46.436
with enthusiasm.

17:48.473 --> 17:52.141
This, of course,
is Miss Adele Invergordon's...

17:52.143 --> 17:55.511
commitment to her father's
dream, possibly the most--

17:55.513 --> 17:58.081
Not one to concede
defeat easily,

17:58.083 --> 18:02.085
Neskaloosa engineered a local
uprising against the tournament.

18:02.087 --> 18:06.522
And I'm sure that you boys
would think I've been drinkin'
too much blackjack tea.

18:06.524 --> 18:10.426
'Course, these are our streets
that they're gonna
be parkin' in.

18:10.428 --> 18:12.829
They will tax the limits
of our constabulary--

18:12.831 --> 18:16.165
Do you think one of them
damn rich Yankees...

18:16.167 --> 18:19.168
gives a hoot about Savannah
or anybody in it ?

18:19.170 --> 18:21.771
Now, now, now, now, now.

18:21.773 --> 18:24.240
Now, we need the Yankee,

18:24.242 --> 18:26.542
but we also need
someone from Savannah...

18:26.544 --> 18:30.379
in the match,
one of us,

18:30.381 --> 18:32.782
givin' Jones and Hagen
a real run for their money.

18:32.784 --> 18:35.785
Then they'll know
what we're made of.

18:35.787 --> 18:38.387
We need someone from Savannah
playin' in our tournament !

18:38.389 --> 18:41.157
What about Dougal McDermott ?
He'd turn a trick or two.

18:41.159 --> 18:44.227
He's a Scot.  The only time he
comes into town is to get drunk.

18:44.229 --> 18:47.563
- Bobby Jones is from Atlanta.
- I said, Savannah !

18:47.565 --> 18:50.533
<i> The South.
  The real South.</i>

18:50.535 --> 18:55.271
Neskaloosa knew the golden rule
of politics better than anyone:

18:55.273 --> 18:56.873
If you can't beat 'em,
lead 'em.

18:56.875 --> 18:59.842
All right, all right.
Hold it, hold it !
Hold it, everyone !

18:59.844 --> 19:01.844
There's one person
we're forgettin'.

19:01.846 --> 19:06.415
We all know there's one man
who hits gargantuan drives
off the tee...

19:06.417 --> 19:09.418
and has a lock picker's
touch around the greens.

19:09.420 --> 19:13.489
Savannah's own Enderby
"Cottonmouth" Conyngham.

19:17.195 --> 19:20.563
Wait a minute !
He's 80 years old !

19:20.565 --> 19:23.232
He'd need one caddie
to carry his golf clubs...

19:23.234 --> 19:25.568
and two
to carry him !

19:28.239 --> 19:31.474
Junuh could whip 'em both.
You're off
your rocker.

19:31.476 --> 19:34.177
Junuh couldn't whip a dead
possum in a gunnysack.

19:34.179 --> 19:36.579
That ain't true.
Oh, yeah ?

19:36.581 --> 19:39.782
<i>- What about Captain Junuh ?
- Who ?</i>

19:39.784 --> 19:42.218
Captain Junuh.

19:42.220 --> 19:45.588
My dad says he's the greatest
golfer Savannah ever had.

19:45.590 --> 19:47.757
Hardy.
Well, it's true.

19:47.759 --> 19:49.859
You must've said it
a hundred times.

19:49.861 --> 19:52.328
<i>Sit down, son.
 The boy's got a point.</i>

19:52.330 --> 19:55.598
-Junuh's born and bred Savannah.
-Exactly !

19:55.600 --> 19:58.234
<i> - And this is the point !
-  I heard he just disappeared.</i>

20:00.505 --> 20:04.607
Forget Rannulph Junuh,
assumin' you can locate
his whereabouts.

20:04.609 --> 20:08.477
I hear he's so far gone,
he wouldn't know a putter
from a pussy willow.

20:08.479 --> 20:10.913
I know where
to find him.

20:13.551 --> 20:16.619
You find him, Hardy,
and we will be there.

20:16.621 --> 20:20.256
Fly, lad, with winged sandals
on your feet !

20:28.633 --> 20:31.901
If I live to be a thousand,
which doesn't seem likely,

20:31.903 --> 20:35.638
I'll never know
where I got the courage
to call out like that.

20:35.640 --> 20:38.574
But once I did,
I wasn't backin' down.

21:05.270 --> 21:08.938
This could've been
the stupidest idea
I've ever had.

21:18.616 --> 21:20.549
Captain Junuh ?

21:21.619 --> 21:24.587
Captain Junuh ?

21:24.589 --> 21:26.822
This is Hardy Greaves, sir.

22:04.429 --> 22:06.429
Get outta here
with that.

22:06.431 --> 22:10.099
Hey, just make sure
you guys save some
of that money for me.

22:10.101 --> 22:13.602
<i> Whoa-ho-ho !
 What have we here ?</i>

22:13.604 --> 22:15.604
Well, well.

22:15.606 --> 22:18.574
Look like we got
a new cardplayer, gents.

22:20.812 --> 22:23.446
It's all right, boy.
There's no need to be scared.

22:23.448 --> 22:25.614
I ain't scared.

22:25.616 --> 22:27.883
I've seen men drunk
plenty of times.

22:27.885 --> 22:31.053
<i>Well, what do they look like ?
 Well, they ain't
 much to look at.</i>

22:31.055 --> 22:35.624
<i> At least not so much as
 they seem to think it is.
 But it don't scare me none.</i>

22:37.829 --> 22:40.529
Gentlemen, we may be
lookin' at the only male
in Chatham County...

22:40.531 --> 22:42.431
who isn't completely
full of shit.

22:43.868 --> 22:46.502
What's your name, son ?

22:46.504 --> 22:49.372
Uh, Hardy.
Hardy Greaves.

22:51.075 --> 22:54.377
- You Frank Greaves' boy ?
- Yes, sir.

22:57.014 --> 22:59.148
What brings
you here, Hardy ?

22:59.150 --> 23:02.818
<i> Maybe I'd better come back
 when you're not so busy.</i>

23:02.820 --> 23:07.590
Busy ?  I thought you
were gonna say drunk.

23:09.427 --> 23:11.694
But I'm not busy
and I'm not drunk.

23:11.696 --> 23:14.897
Fact is, there ain't enough
whiskey in the state of Georgia
to get me drunk enough.

23:16.901 --> 23:19.635
Well, how drunk
is drunk enough,

23:19.637 --> 23:22.838
<i> - Captain Junuh ?
-  Whoo.</i>

23:22.840 --> 23:25.541
Good question, Hardy.
Come on over here, take a seat.

23:25.543 --> 23:27.610
I'll tell you how drunk
drunk enough is.

23:27.612 --> 23:30.646
Aaron, you think you
can find the young man
a bottle of Nehi ?

23:30.648 --> 23:34.183
Expect I could.
Just as long as I takes
my money with me.

23:38.823 --> 23:41.524
Now, the question
on the table...

23:41.526 --> 23:43.993
is how drunk
is drunk enough ?

23:45.730 --> 23:48.964
And the answer is that it's
all a matter of brain cells.

23:48.966 --> 23:52.067
- Brain cells ?
- That's right, Hardy.

23:52.069 --> 23:56.205
You see, every drink
of liquor you take kills
a thousand brain cells.

23:56.207 --> 23:58.974
But that doesn't
much matter, 'cause
we got billions more.

23:58.976 --> 24:01.076
And first the
sadness cells die,

24:01.078 --> 24:04.113
so you smile
real big.

24:04.115 --> 24:06.115
And then
the quiet cells go,

24:06.117 --> 24:09.151
so you just say
everything real loud
for no reason at all.

24:09.153 --> 24:12.188
But that's okay, because
the stupid cells go next,

24:12.190 --> 24:16.625
so everything you say
is real smart.

24:16.627 --> 24:21.130
And finally...
come the memory cells.

24:23.468 --> 24:25.935
These are tough
sons of bitches to kill.

24:28.639 --> 24:30.873
Well, there's a golf match
out at Krewe Island...

24:30.875 --> 24:33.142
between Bobby Jones
and Walter Hagen,

24:33.144 --> 24:36.645
and there was a meeting
to see who would stand up
for Savannah in the match,

24:36.647 --> 24:38.714
so I said you would.

24:38.716 --> 24:42.117
That's why I'm here,
so you can beat Bobby Jones
and Walter Hagen.

24:44.489 --> 24:46.655
Hell, I'm a whole lot
drunker than I thought.

24:46.657 --> 24:49.625
I'll caddie for ya.
You gonna
caddie for me ?

24:49.627 --> 24:52.061
Against Bobby Jones
and Walter Hagen ?
Yes, sir !

24:52.063 --> 24:54.663
- I'll caddie for you too.
- Aaron will carry the clubs.

24:54.665 --> 24:58.267
I'll carry the balls.
And I'll carry them
little wooden tees !

24:58.269 --> 25:00.169
And I'll carry Junuh !

25:01.939 --> 25:04.106
I wasn't jokin' !

25:04.108 --> 25:07.643
I heard my dad tell how
you won every golf tournament
there ever was in the South.

25:07.645 --> 25:10.646
And how you hit
a drive so long...

25:10.648 --> 25:14.950
that they made you
stop playin' for 20 minutes
just to measure it for a record.

25:14.952 --> 25:17.119
And how you
used to swing righty,

25:17.121 --> 25:20.656
but you was in the woods once
by this tree, and there was
no room to swing righty,

25:20.658 --> 25:23.659
so you borrowed
some guy's lefty club...

25:23.661 --> 25:26.962
and hit the ball
six inches from the hole.

25:29.934 --> 25:32.635
It's time for you
to go home, Hardy.

25:32.637 --> 25:34.670
I ain't goin'.

25:34.672 --> 25:36.939
Well, suit yourself,
'cause I'm goin' to bed.

25:45.283 --> 25:47.550
Night,
gentlemen.

25:58.963 --> 26:02.031
- The hell you doin'
in my house ?
- Trespassin', Junuh.

26:02.033 --> 26:05.568
But on a matter of great
importance-- to no less
than Savannah herself.

26:05.570 --> 26:08.637
Some delegate you got there.
Isn't it a little
past his bedtime ?

26:08.639 --> 26:13.142
Isaiah 11:6:
"And a little child
shall lead them."

26:13.144 --> 26:18.247
This is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity, Junuh.

26:18.249 --> 26:22.885
<i>So what's in it
for you ?
 Pride.</i>

26:22.887 --> 26:26.989
The great city of Savannah,
so close to my heart.
So close to all our hearts.

26:26.991 --> 26:29.658
Well, you're wastin' your time ?
I'm not playin'.

26:29.660 --> 26:32.094
Why is that ?

26:32.096 --> 26:34.163
I lost my swing.

26:34.165 --> 26:38.133
Then find it.
Goddamn it !

26:38.135 --> 26:41.670
<i> Because you're playin' !
 That's all there is to it !
 Savannah needs you, Junuh !</i>

26:41.672 --> 26:45.341
<i>Why don't you get Dougal
McDermott ?  He'll play.
 Balls !</i>

26:45.343 --> 26:48.277
We don't need some sawed-off
Scotsman poopin' drives out
40 yards...

26:48.279 --> 26:50.245
<i> in Jones' and Hagen's way.</i>

26:50.247 --> 26:53.882
<i> We need a man with
 thunder in his fist,</i>

26:53.884 --> 26:57.252
a hero to boom that pill out
past those golfin' gods !

26:57.254 --> 27:01.023
- We need a knight.
- You are our gentle-born
chevalier.

27:04.629 --> 27:07.329
That's one hell
of a speech, fellas.

27:07.331 --> 27:09.398
I don't take no
for an answer.

27:09.400 --> 27:13.068
Well, you're gonna have to,
'cause I'm not playin'.

27:13.070 --> 27:15.304
Now get out.

27:53.210 --> 27:56.445
Someone you picked up
on your travels ?

27:56.447 --> 27:58.881
He's not mine.

27:58.883 --> 28:02.217
He's a little young for
a drinking companion,
don't you think ?

28:04.955 --> 28:08.123
So, Adele,
what can I do for you ?

28:10.261 --> 28:13.462
I think you know
why I'm here, Junuh.
I do.

28:13.464 --> 28:17.366
A little late to be out lookin'
for romance, though, isn't it ?

28:17.368 --> 28:20.035
Would that do it,
Junuh ?

28:21.439 --> 28:24.907
Would you play in the match
if I had sex with you ?

28:26.177 --> 28:28.877
Yeah, that would do it.

28:28.879 --> 28:31.146
Well, that's good,
Junuh.

28:31.148 --> 28:34.283
Considering how infrequently
we've seen each other
since you've been back,

28:34.285 --> 28:36.485
I thought this was
gonna be more difficult.

28:36.487 --> 28:39.254
Now, where would you
like to do it ?

28:40.458 --> 28:43.158
Right here is fine.

28:47.264 --> 28:50.432
Don't worry about him.
He's out like a light.

28:50.434 --> 28:53.502
Take an earthquake
to wake him up.

28:56.140 --> 28:58.440
For an earthquake,
you'd have to play many more
tournaments at Krewe Island...

28:58.442 --> 29:01.143
and do quite well
at them.

29:09.220 --> 29:11.220
Well,

29:11.222 --> 29:14.156
how do you suggest
we begin ?

29:14.158 --> 29:16.391
Shall I just run
and jump on you,

29:16.393 --> 29:19.962
or would you like some
preliminary romancin' ?

29:19.964 --> 29:24.333
- Romancin' sounds good.
- Very well, then.

29:31.375 --> 29:34.109
Here's one
short kiss.

29:34.111 --> 29:38.046
It is, I'm afraid,
all the romancin'
I have in me at this time.

30:12.383 --> 30:16.952
I do hope I haven't
given the impression that
I'm cryin' over us, Junuh,

30:16.954 --> 30:19.521
because I'm not.

30:19.523 --> 30:22.958
You're not ?

30:22.960 --> 30:25.327
No, I'm not.

30:25.329 --> 30:27.229
I'm cryin'
over Savannah.

30:27.231 --> 30:29.531
Savannah ?

30:29.533 --> 30:32.968
Over her pain
and the pain
of her people.

30:35.005 --> 30:38.006
You're in tears
over Savannah ?
I am.

30:38.008 --> 30:40.475
I truly am.

30:40.477 --> 30:43.245
Then who'd you take
your clothes off for ?

30:43.247 --> 30:45.180
Chattanooga ?

30:49.253 --> 30:51.553
Well.

30:51.555 --> 30:55.524
<i> This certainly has been
 a colossal waste of time.</i>

30:55.526 --> 30:58.393
I didn't ask you
to come here.

30:58.395 --> 31:02.364
No, you certainly did not,
Junuh.

31:02.366 --> 31:06.268
You know, if you ever
get tired of sittin' around
and feelin' sorry for yourself,

31:06.270 --> 31:08.904
a little golf might
just do you some good.

31:08.906 --> 31:11.473
I've lost my swing,
Adele.

31:12.543 --> 31:14.543
Really ?

31:17.414 --> 31:19.314
Where'd it go ?

31:28.359 --> 31:31.560
You can open your
eyes now, Hardy.

31:31.562 --> 31:34.496
Your education is over.

31:34.498 --> 31:37.566
Go on home now.

32:29.954 --> 32:31.553
Jesus.

32:48.238 --> 32:51.139
- Who's that ?
- Just me.

32:53.277 --> 32:56.511
Just a man tryin'
to find somewhere
to rest his tired feet,

32:56.513 --> 32:59.114
takin' in some
of God's glories.

32:59.116 --> 33:02.184
- My, what a night.
- I could've killed you
out there.

33:02.186 --> 33:03.986
Oh, no, sir.

33:03.988 --> 33:07.089
See, I set myself
directly in front of you.

33:07.091 --> 33:10.759
Judgin' by how you was hittin'
them balls, I figured that's
where I'd be out of harm's way.

33:10.761 --> 33:12.995
Excuse me, sir.

33:15.532 --> 33:18.400
They say you can
tell a player by his grip.

33:18.402 --> 33:22.404
If you want some food or
somethin', you can go on
into the house, help yourself.

33:22.406 --> 33:24.406
Oh, thank you
kindly, sir.

33:24.408 --> 33:26.441
<i> Yeah.</i>

33:26.443 --> 33:29.277
Yeah, I always felt
a man's grip on his club...

33:29.279 --> 33:31.346
is just like a man's
grip on his world.

33:31.348 --> 33:34.549
- Look, is there
somethin' you want ?
- Five dollars guaranteed.

33:34.551 --> 33:36.785
Guaranteed for what ?

33:36.787 --> 33:40.355
Well, there's a big match
comin' up with Mr. Jones
and Mr. Hagen.

33:40.357 --> 33:42.557
Fella gonna
be needin' a caddie.

33:42.559 --> 33:44.559
You a caddie ?

33:44.561 --> 33:48.463
Well, that depends.
You a golfer ?

33:51.435 --> 33:54.536
Well, I don't need a caddie
'cause I'm not playin'.

33:54.538 --> 33:56.471
I don't play
anymore at all.

33:56.473 --> 33:59.741
Oh.  Well,
thank you, sir.

33:59.743 --> 34:02.544
I'll take you up on
that food you offered me.
All right.

34:02.546 --> 34:05.047
Evenin', sir.
Mm-hmm.

34:06.316 --> 34:08.550
<i> Don't make
 no sense, is all.</i>

34:08.552 --> 34:12.521
Man say he don't play no golf,
yet he out here
this shade of night,

34:12.523 --> 34:14.822
hittin' balls off into dark
where he can't even see 'em.

34:14.824 --> 34:18.560
Yep, well, I've done things
that made less sense.

34:18.562 --> 34:21.797
As we all have.

34:21.799 --> 34:25.567
For $5 guaranteed,
I'm offerin' you
my caddie services.

34:25.569 --> 34:27.601
For $5 ?

34:27.603 --> 34:31.206
You know the winner gets
10,000, and the caddie's
cut is 10% of that.

34:31.208 --> 34:34.242
So that's $1,000.
I'll take $5
guaranteed.

34:34.244 --> 34:37.212
- You don't want $1,000 ?
- You done already said
you ain't even playin'.

34:37.214 --> 34:40.581
And Lord knows
how awful you're
gonna look if you do.

34:40.583 --> 34:43.585
So $5 guaranteed
sounds pretty good
from where I'm sittin'.

34:47.424 --> 34:50.525
Yeah, the rhythm of the game
just like the rhythm of life.

34:50.527 --> 34:52.159
Here.

34:52.161 --> 34:54.228
Here !

34:54.231 --> 34:56.498
Oh, no, sir,
I don't--
Go on.

34:57.534 --> 34:59.534
Go ahead.

34:59.536 --> 35:02.237
Well, thank you, sir.

35:06.310 --> 35:10.445
You know, some folks say
you should put the ball in--
in the front of your stance.

35:10.447 --> 35:12.447
Other folks say
you should put--

35:12.449 --> 35:16.485
You gonna hit the ball
or are you gonna dance with it ?

35:16.487 --> 35:18.787
Actually, I'm kind of
partial to dancin'.
Me and this gal--

35:18.789 --> 35:20.822
Hit the ball.

35:31.135 --> 35:33.768
So, you're a golfer.

35:33.770 --> 35:36.571
Uh, no,
I don't play golf.

35:36.573 --> 35:39.207
Give me that damn thing.

35:41.278 --> 35:43.845
Here, uh--
See, the trick is...

35:43.847 --> 35:46.148
to find your swing.

35:46.150 --> 35:48.450
What'd you say ?

35:48.452 --> 35:51.586
Well, you lost your swing.

35:51.588 --> 35:54.456
We got to go find it.

35:54.458 --> 35:59.327
Now, it's somewhere
in the harmony
of all that is--

36:00.564 --> 36:02.564
Ooh.

36:02.566 --> 36:05.167
All that was--

36:06.803 --> 36:10.772
Ooh.
All that will be.

36:13.410 --> 36:16.178
Whoa.
Ooo-eee !

36:16.180 --> 36:19.514
I ain't seen a man
hit a ball like that...

36:19.516 --> 36:22.817
since the North-South
Championship of 1916.

36:22.819 --> 36:27.455
You know, they stopped play
for 20 minutes to measure
how far it went.

36:27.457 --> 36:29.591
Bagger Vance
the name.

36:33.463 --> 36:35.497
Come on, let's hit
a few more.

36:37.668 --> 36:41.603
And that,
they say, is how Bagger Vance
became Junuh's caddie.

36:41.605 --> 36:43.905
Oh, yeah.
One more
just like that.

36:43.907 --> 36:46.608
Just like
that one there.

36:46.610 --> 36:48.877
I'm tellin' you the truth,
Wilbur Charles.

36:50.881 --> 36:53.515
She was down to her
panties and brassiere.

36:53.517 --> 36:55.750
And you were in the room
watchin' all the time ?

36:55.752 --> 36:57.919
You really think we're that
stupid that we believe...

36:57.921 --> 37:01.556
Miss Adele got down
to her skivvies with you
right in the room watching ?

37:01.558 --> 37:03.558
It's the God's
honest truth, Eugene.

37:03.560 --> 37:06.895
Scalp me, shrink my head,
and roast it on the stake...

37:06.897 --> 37:08.830
if that ain't
exactly what happened.

37:08.832 --> 37:11.800
She thought I was asleep
the whole time.

37:11.802 --> 37:14.336
And that ain't all.
Junuh's gonna play.

37:14.338 --> 37:17.239
He said that ?

37:17.241 --> 37:21.276
Not in so many words, but--
Hey, look over there.

37:21.278 --> 37:25.013
Ain't that Miss Adele now
across the street ?
Where ?  Where ?

37:25.015 --> 37:28.316
She just went into
Louder's Notions.
I could swear it's her.

37:28.318 --> 37:30.318
I'd know that
figure anywhere.

37:35.392 --> 37:39.594
Well, as far as Junuh
is concerned, I guess
that's just about it.

37:39.596 --> 37:43.598
If we don't have someone
from Savannah, I will not
support this match.

37:43.600 --> 37:45.800
All right.

37:45.802 --> 37:49.537
I'll play in your
damn golf match.

37:49.539 --> 37:52.407
I should've let you
finish what you started.

37:52.409 --> 37:54.609
<i> Now I got nothin' at all
 to show for it.</i>

37:54.611 --> 37:58.413
Well, for the life of me,
I have no idea what
you're referrin' to.

37:58.415 --> 38:01.850
I can explain it if you like.
I don't believe
that will be necessary !

38:01.852 --> 38:04.286
God bless Savannah.

38:10.494 --> 38:14.296
The day that Jones and Hagen
arrived in Savannah...

38:14.298 --> 38:16.531
was declared a holiday.

38:16.533 --> 38:20.035
¶¶

38:35.786 --> 38:39.587
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
the first golf tournament--

38:39.589 --> 38:41.990
That's O.B. Keeler.

38:41.992 --> 38:44.025
He writes for
theAtlanta Journal.

38:44.027 --> 38:46.594
He goes wherever
Bobby Jones goes.

38:46.596 --> 38:49.597
And that's Walter Hagen's man,
Spec Hammond.

38:49.599 --> 38:52.467
They say Hagen
won't play without him.

38:54.604 --> 38:58.940
And that's Grantland Rice,
the most powerful sports writer
in the country.

38:58.942 --> 39:01.576
And he's staying
at our boarding house,
because he's nobody's man.

39:01.578 --> 39:04.779
Aah !

39:06.116 --> 39:10.118
Mr. Robert Tyre Jones, Jr.,
of Atlanta, Georgia.

39:18.562 --> 39:21.830
Mr. Jones has won
13 national championships,

39:21.832 --> 39:25.600
including four U.S. Opens
and five U.S. Amateurs.

39:25.602 --> 39:31.573
He has also won
all three British Opens
in which he has played.

39:31.575 --> 39:34.042
For the first time
in history, last year...

39:34.044 --> 39:36.945
he won the Grand Slam--

39:36.947 --> 39:40.582
all four major golf
championships in a single year !

39:45.055 --> 39:48.890
But what is not well-known
is that at the very same time...

39:48.892 --> 39:50.825
he was winnin'
all his championships,

39:50.827 --> 39:54.929
Mr. Jones was earning
a degree in engineering
from Georgia Tech,

39:54.931 --> 39:57.098
a degree in English
Literature from Harvard,

39:57.100 --> 40:01.436
and a law degree from Emory
University here in Georgia,

40:01.438 --> 40:03.638
all with distinction.

40:08.879 --> 40:10.879
Mr. Walter Hagen--

40:15.852 --> 40:19.087
Mr. Hagen has won
11 national championships,

40:19.089 --> 40:23.024
includin' four British Opens
and five PGA's.

40:23.026 --> 40:25.660
And in one stretch,

40:25.662 --> 40:28.930
Mr. Hagen won 22 straight
professional championships.

40:32.569 --> 40:34.436
That's work !

40:35.972 --> 40:38.173
Mr. Rannulph Junuh--

40:49.152 --> 40:51.486
Walter, I think
we're the underdogs.

40:55.559 --> 40:57.926
Born and bred
in Savannah, Georgia !

41:07.103 --> 41:12.540
Mr.-- Mr. Junuh won
the Georgia Amateur
at the age of 16,

41:12.542 --> 41:15.143
makin' him the youngest man
to ever do so.

41:15.145 --> 41:17.645
And until he left for
the war, was considered...

41:17.647 --> 41:20.548
the South's premier golfer.

41:20.550 --> 41:24.018
Mr. Junuh returned
from the war a hero,

41:24.020 --> 41:26.888
decorated with
the Medal of Honor...

41:26.890 --> 41:29.624
for survivin'
a deadly mission in which...

41:29.626 --> 41:32.193
most--

41:36.166 --> 41:38.666
Most-- uh--

41:38.668 --> 41:42.670
The rest of his company
were tragically defeated.

41:42.672 --> 41:45.640
Boy, makes you think twice
about steppin' on his ball,
doesn't it, Bobby ?

41:47.611 --> 41:49.544
Mr. Hagen.

41:53.517 --> 41:57.652
Ladies and gentlemen,
Bobby Jones, Walter Hagen...

41:57.654 --> 42:00.088
and our very own
Rannulph Junuh !

42:00.090 --> 42:02.290
¶¶

42:09.566 --> 42:11.666
On behalf--

42:11.668 --> 42:14.936
On behalf of the great
city of Savannah--

42:17.841 --> 42:20.675
Sure is some storm
a-brewin'.

42:22.646 --> 42:25.213
So, where you
off to ?

42:25.215 --> 42:27.549
However far it takes.

42:27.551 --> 42:30.685
<i>You don't expect me
to stay around here, do you ?
 Oh, no, not me.</i>

42:30.687 --> 42:34.989
I consider it one of the six
great miracles of the world
you was even there at all today.

42:34.991 --> 42:37.625
<i> Let me help you
 with these bags.</i>

42:37.627 --> 42:40.161
You heard Adele.

42:40.163 --> 42:43.598
Bobby Jones never finished lower
than second in any tournament
he ever played in.

42:43.600 --> 42:47.268
I believe Miss Adele said
he finished lower
than second once.

42:47.270 --> 42:50.238
Must've been the week
he took his law exams.

42:50.240 --> 42:52.307
Yeah, I believe
it was.

42:54.978 --> 42:58.646
Uh, you gonna be needin'
these shoes where you're
goin', Mr. Junuh ?

42:58.648 --> 43:00.648
They look like they
just about my size.

43:00.650 --> 43:03.651
Keep 'em.
Thank you kindly,
sir.

43:11.661 --> 43:14.596
Yep, sure is some storm
headin' this way.

43:22.172 --> 43:25.206
It's a real pleasure
to welcome you to our home.

43:25.208 --> 43:27.976
It's a pleasure to be here,
ma'am.  Thank you.

43:27.978 --> 43:30.144
Hardy, you take
his belongin's
up to his room.

43:30.146 --> 43:33.081
Then come right back.
I got chores for you.
Yes, ma'am.

43:33.083 --> 43:36.918
I expect this is the most
exciting sportin' event ever.

43:36.920 --> 43:39.253
<i>Ain't it, Mr. Rice ?
 Why is that, son ?</i>

43:39.255 --> 43:43.057
Why ?  'Cause of
Jones and Hagen.
They's out for blood.

43:43.059 --> 43:45.360
Oh, I didn't come
for Jones or Hagen.

43:45.362 --> 43:47.695
I came for Rannulph Junuh.

43:47.697 --> 43:51.399
You come all the way down
from New York City
to see Junuh ?

43:51.401 --> 43:53.401
Uh-huh.

43:53.403 --> 43:57.171
I saw Junuh play once.
Then he disappeared.

43:57.173 --> 44:00.975
I'd love to see him
play again, especially
against Jones and Hagen.

44:03.647 --> 44:06.347
Go get 'em, Junuh !
You go get 'em !

44:06.349 --> 44:10.118
God bless you, Junuh !
Show 'em what
Savannah's made of !

44:10.120 --> 44:13.921
- Go get 'em, Junuh !
- Hey, Junuh, give 'em hell !

44:16.192 --> 44:18.126
- "Give 'em hell."
- You can do it !

44:37.147 --> 44:39.080
Damn.

45:42.278 --> 45:45.313
So I takes it you was
interested in bein'...

45:45.315 --> 45:47.215
<i> Mr. Junuh's forecaddie.</i>

45:48.418 --> 45:50.985
- No.
- No ?

45:50.987 --> 45:53.354
- No !
- No ?

45:53.356 --> 45:55.456
Well, maybe I was,

45:55.458 --> 45:59.193
but I guess I just ain't
got the nerve to ask you yet.

45:59.195 --> 46:02.063
I ain't got the time
to sit around and wait, so
here's what I'm proposin'.

46:02.065 --> 46:05.399
I'm gonna assume that just
about the moment you gets
up the nerve to ask me...

46:05.401 --> 46:08.903
gonna be just about
the same moment I decide
I'm gonna tell you yeah.

46:08.905 --> 46:11.205
How that suit you ?

46:11.207 --> 46:14.475
That suits me
just fine, sir.
Folks call me Bagger.

46:17.881 --> 46:20.481
Yes, sir, Bagger, sir.

46:20.483 --> 46:23.484
You may want to get
to pickin' all the crud
out of Mr. Junuh's shoes.

46:23.486 --> 46:27.455
<i> You through with that,
 we got us some measurin'
 to do out on the course.</i>

46:46.342 --> 46:50.344
Junuh knew now
that if he were to have any
chance at all in the tournament,

46:50.346 --> 46:54.215
he had no choice but to
come to terms with his demons.

46:57.253 --> 46:59.353
The only question
in Junuh's mind...

46:59.355 --> 47:02.490
was which demon was
givin' him the most aggravation:

47:02.492 --> 47:05.860
Bagger Vance
or Miss Adele Invergordon.

47:06.930 --> 47:08.930
<i> Mr. Jones ?</i>

47:08.932 --> 47:11.132
<i> Could you hold,
 please ?</i>

47:13.970 --> 47:16.370
Thank you very much,
Mr. Jones.

47:16.372 --> 47:18.940
¶¶

47:28.985 --> 47:31.319
<i> Any time now.
 Okay.</i>

47:32.488 --> 47:35.122
<i> That's very nice.</i>

47:35.124 --> 47:37.458
<i> Thank you very much,
 Mr. Hagen.</i>

47:48.271 --> 47:50.538
<i> Dancin' picture, sir ?</i>

47:52.542 --> 47:55.176
Thank you
very much.

47:57.113 --> 48:00.114
¶¶
That's it. Very nice look.
Right over here.

48:00.116 --> 48:03.484
<i> Big smile.
 No, don't stop dancin'.
 Stay together.</i>

48:03.486 --> 48:06.354
<i> Just pretend there's music.
 Keep goin'.  Keep goin'.</i>

48:06.356 --> 48:09.423
<i> Look right over here.
 Okay.</i>

48:11.427 --> 48:13.427
<i> Give me a smile.</i>

48:15.498 --> 48:17.431
<i> Thank you
 very much.</i>

48:18.501 --> 48:21.035
¶¶

48:23.139 --> 48:25.506
May I have the pleasure
of this dance, please ?
Yes.

48:33.316 --> 48:36.017
Longer.

48:36.019 --> 48:38.519
A little shorter.

48:38.521 --> 48:40.521
How's that ?

48:40.523 --> 48:43.090
<i> Yeah, that's good.
 One stride equals a yard.</i>

48:43.092 --> 48:45.526
You go on over to the tee
and start countin'.

48:45.528 --> 48:48.529
Top golfers always tried to get
a leg up on the competition...

48:48.531 --> 48:52.099
by havin' the men
they trusted most sneak
onto the course at night...

48:52.101 --> 48:54.168
and do their own
measurements.

48:54.170 --> 48:58.239
So Bagger and I
walked the course
that night, measurin' away.

48:58.241 --> 49:00.408
Bagger never
wrote down a number.

49:00.410 --> 49:02.476
He filed it all
in his head.

49:06.482 --> 49:08.249
Hit one a little harder.

49:12.488 --> 49:14.989
Go on,
do that again.

49:16.326 --> 49:20.461
Yeah, right here is
where this game is won,

49:20.463 --> 49:24.098
right here on the green,
but first you got to see it.

49:24.100 --> 49:26.968
<i> Sun gonna be there
 in the mornin',</i>

49:26.970 --> 49:29.971
over there
in the afternoon.

49:29.973 --> 49:32.340
Funny thing is,
blades of grass...

49:32.342 --> 49:34.976
are gonna follow the sun.

49:38.147 --> 49:40.147
<i> The grain
 is gonna shift.</i>

49:41.517 --> 49:44.118
That same putt...

49:44.120 --> 49:46.520
is gonna go one way
in the mornin',

49:46.522 --> 49:49.023
the other
in the afternoon.

49:49.025 --> 49:51.993
One way in the mornin',
the other in the afternoon.

49:51.995 --> 49:53.561
<i> You see that ?</i>

49:53.563 --> 49:57.465
Yeah, a golf course
puts folks through
quite a punishment.

49:58.735 --> 50:01.302
It lives and breathes
just like us.

50:02.372 --> 50:05.206
Do you think
Junuh can win ?

50:05.208 --> 50:08.776
Yeah, if he can find
his authentic swing.

50:08.778 --> 50:10.544
Authentic ?

50:12.348 --> 50:14.548
Go on,
hit one more for me.

50:20.223 --> 50:22.556
Yep, inside each
and every one of us...

50:22.558 --> 50:25.159
is one true,
authentic swing.

50:25.161 --> 50:29.463
<i> Somethin' we was born with,
 somethin' that's ours
 and ours alone.</i>

50:29.465 --> 50:32.433
Somethin' that can't be
taught to you or learned.

50:32.435 --> 50:35.302
Somethin' that
got to be remembered.

50:35.304 --> 50:38.506
Over time, the world can
rob us of that swing.

50:38.508 --> 50:41.342
<i> It get buried
 inside us under...</i>

50:42.578 --> 50:45.579
all our wouldas
and couldas and shouldas.

50:45.581 --> 50:49.216
<i> Some folks even forget
 what they swing was like.</i>

50:50.553 --> 50:53.587
Some folks even forget
what they swing was like.

50:56.392 --> 50:59.794
<i> You keep swingin'.
 But I don't have
 any balls.</i>

50:59.796 --> 51:03.464
Don't worry about
hittin' the ball
the way it's gonna go.

51:03.466 --> 51:06.534
<i> Just swing the club,
 feel the club.</i>

51:06.536 --> 51:08.769
<i> Now close your eyes.</i>

51:08.771 --> 51:12.573
<i>Close my--
 You can't make that
 ball go in that hole.</i>

51:12.575 --> 51:15.576
You got to let it.

51:15.578 --> 51:19.580
I want you to feel that club,
feel the weight of the club.

51:19.582 --> 51:22.783
Settle in deeper, then
drop the ball soft as butter.

51:22.785 --> 51:25.820
Listen to the sounds
of the night.

51:25.822 --> 51:29.423
You just keep swingin' that club
until you feel the breeze
comin' off the sea.

51:29.425 --> 51:32.793
Inside every one of us
is one true, authentic swing.

51:34.597 --> 51:37.598
You just keep swingin' that club
until your authentic swing--

51:37.600 --> 51:41.602
You're part of the whole thing,
somethin' you was born with.

51:41.604 --> 51:43.604
That's a good thing.

51:43.606 --> 51:46.607
I don't feel a thing.

51:46.609 --> 51:50.177
You just keep swingin'
that club until you're
part of the whole thing.

51:51.314 --> 51:54.215
That's a good thing.

51:54.217 --> 51:56.851
Can you see it ?

52:08.197 --> 52:10.764
<i> All right,
 time to go.</i>

52:10.766 --> 52:12.199
Why ?

52:23.446 --> 52:27.448
They say that God is happiest
when His children are at play.

52:27.450 --> 52:32.419
Well, it certainly seemed like
God was in fine spirits when
the day of the match dawned.

52:36.759 --> 52:39.894
People came from far and wide.

52:39.896 --> 52:44.932
There wasn't a room to be found
in either boarding house
or the Krewe Island Hotel.

52:44.934 --> 52:48.402
The match had been designed
as the ultimate championship:

52:48.404 --> 52:50.404
thirty-six holes on Saturday...

52:50.406 --> 52:53.841
followed by another grueling
thirty-six holes on Sunday.

53:00.783 --> 53:02.750
Good luck today.

53:16.799 --> 53:18.799
Where's Hagen ?

53:18.801 --> 53:20.734
Oh, he'll be here.

53:50.900 --> 53:53.467
Hello, Mr. Junuh.  How are you ?
Bob, how are you ?
Walter.

53:53.469 --> 53:56.470
They do put on a splendid
show, don't they, O.B. ?

53:56.472 --> 53:59.473
I hear that later today
they'll even be hittin'
some golf balls.

53:59.475 --> 54:02.876
Ladies and gentlemen.

54:02.878 --> 54:05.679
By virtue of the draw,

54:05.681 --> 54:08.482
Mr. Jones will hit first,

54:08.484 --> 54:11.485
Mr. Hagen second,

54:11.487 --> 54:13.487
and then Mr. Junuh.

54:30.473 --> 54:32.473
Shh.

54:35.778 --> 54:37.978
And then suddenly,
in that moment,

54:37.980 --> 54:41.482
I felt as if I could hear
the earth breathin' beneath me.

55:34.470 --> 55:36.837
Junuh hit a promising
opening drive,

55:36.839 --> 55:38.672
and I was sure
he was on his way.

55:40.976 --> 55:44.478
Nice shot.
Absolutely.

55:50.986 --> 55:56.423
It's hard
to imagine three more different
approaches to the game of golf.

55:56.425 --> 56:00.461
Bobby Jones's swing was
a study of grace in motion.

56:00.463 --> 56:04.498
He had a way of making
the difficult shots look easy...

56:04.500 --> 56:06.967
and the easy shots
look even easier.

56:14.377 --> 56:17.845
Hagen, on the other hand,
hit more bad shots
in a single game...

56:17.847 --> 56:19.847
than most golfers do
in a season.

56:22.051 --> 56:25.853
But Hagen had long ago
learned one thing.

56:27.890 --> 56:32.393
Three lousy shots
and one brilliant shot
can still make par.

56:35.898 --> 56:40.033
And Junuh, well, even now
I can't think of it
without wincin'.

56:47.042 --> 56:50.711
Beach.
Go ball, go.

56:50.713 --> 56:54.014
<i>Yep. Beach.</i>

56:55.951 --> 56:59.520
We sure got lovely weather
for it this morning, though,
don't we ?

56:59.522 --> 57:01.455
Let me get that
from you, sir.

57:14.537 --> 57:16.203
Any ideas ?

57:16.205 --> 57:18.806
Hmm.  About what ?

57:21.811 --> 57:23.744
Could you give me
a club ?

57:31.487 --> 57:33.020
Yeah.
That's a good one there.

57:42.832 --> 57:46.033
What the hell's wrong
with his grip ?

58:00.049 --> 58:03.250
By the end of five holes,
Junuh was five strokes behind...

58:03.252 --> 58:07.020
with 67 holes to go.

58:07.022 --> 58:11.492
And things would've been
a lot worse if it weren't
for Junuh's shot on the sixth.

58:21.971 --> 58:25.072
It was a birdie,
one stroke under par...

58:25.074 --> 58:29.009
for the hole,
moving him to four behind
Jones and Hagen...

58:29.011 --> 58:32.012
and his only glimmer of hope
for the entire round.

58:32.014 --> 58:34.081
I think I found my game.

58:34.083 --> 58:37.284
Good news, Mr. Junuh.
Now all we gots to do is
figure out what game that is.

58:40.823 --> 58:43.757
By the 18th tee, at the close
of the morning round,

58:43.759 --> 58:46.159
Jones and Hagen
were neck and neck.

58:55.304 --> 58:59.306
And as for Junuh--
This is becoming
embarrassing.

58:59.308 --> 59:03.810
Oh, no, sir.
It's been embarrassing
for quite some time now.

59:25.301 --> 59:29.136
May I make a suggestion
to you ?

59:29.138 --> 59:32.940
- What now ?
 - Why don't you just hook it out of bounds ?

59:32.942 --> 59:37.210
Yeah.  Just curve it out
over them pretty trees
into the ocean.

59:37.212 --> 59:42.883
Really, just do what you
been doin'.  Then you'll
be so far out the match,

59:42.885 --> 59:45.085
man, we can just relax,
enjoy ourselves
the rest of the way.

59:45.087 --> 59:47.054
Yeah.

59:54.997 --> 59:57.698
What you waitin' for ?
Go on.

59:57.700 --> 01:00:00.334
Just hook it to hell and gone.
Put yourself out your misery.

01:00:44.313 --> 01:00:46.713
You want to quit,
Mr. Junuh ?

01:00:48.017 --> 01:00:50.250
You can just go ahead
and creep off somewhere.

01:00:50.252 --> 01:00:54.321
I'll tell folk you took sick.
Truth be told, ain't nobody
gonna really object.

01:00:54.323 --> 01:00:58.325
Fact, they'd probably be
happy as bugs in a bake shop,
see you pack up and go home.

01:00:58.327 --> 01:01:00.994
You know I can't quit.

01:01:00.996 --> 01:01:03.764
I know.

01:01:03.766 --> 01:01:05.899
Just makin' sure
you know it too.

01:01:28.791 --> 01:01:31.925
Man alive !
The fairway.

01:01:44.006 --> 01:01:47.174
Hello, Bagger.
Hello.  Mr. Bagger Vance.

01:01:47.176 --> 01:01:49.810
I want an explanation.
It better be a good one.

01:01:49.812 --> 01:01:52.179
What on God's green earth
are you tellin' him ?

01:01:52.181 --> 01:01:54.347
Sir, I'd sure be most
appreciative if we could talk
about this a bit later.

01:01:54.349 --> 01:01:56.349
Right now I'm busy
assisting Mr. Junuh.

01:01:56.351 --> 01:01:58.819
Well, you have done a hell
of a job of it so far.
Okay, okay !

01:01:58.821 --> 01:02:00.821
Let me talk to him,
Neskaloosa.

01:02:00.823 --> 01:02:03.256
Mr. Vance, I think
what the judge is trying
to determine here...

01:02:03.258 --> 01:02:07.060
is what exactly your strategy
is for helping poor Mr. Junuh
find his game,

01:02:07.062 --> 01:02:10.130
because to the untrained
observer it appears you know
as much about being a caddie...

01:02:10.132 --> 01:02:12.365
as I do about
driving a locomotive.

01:02:12.367 --> 01:02:14.367
Oh, you-all want
to know my strategy.

01:02:14.369 --> 01:02:17.938
Well, right now my player
is a little confused
about who he is.

01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:20.774
See, he still thinks
he's Rannulph Junuh.

01:02:20.776 --> 01:02:23.810
He is Rannulph Junuh,
you damn twit.

01:02:23.812 --> 01:02:26.813
Well, he is and he ain't.

01:02:40.395 --> 01:02:43.864
Thank you.
Thank you.

01:03:14.429 --> 01:03:17.130
Anybody drinkin' ?
Here.  I'm gonna get a drink.

01:03:41.056 --> 01:03:42.956
It'll come.

01:04:01.143 --> 01:04:03.877
I had me a uncle
named Rufus.

01:04:03.879 --> 01:04:07.214
<i> Lost his right arm
 in a cotton gin.</i>

01:04:07.216 --> 01:04:10.350
Learned how to do everything
with his left arm.

01:04:10.352 --> 01:04:14.287
<i>- Then he lost that
 changing a wagon wheel.</i>

01:04:14.289 --> 01:04:17.424
Axle snapped.
So he learned how to do
everything with his teeth.

01:04:17.426 --> 01:04:20.093
- It was a mistake.
- One night he says some
dumb things to Mr. Johnny...

01:04:20.095 --> 01:04:21.628
<i> he shouldn't had said.</i>

01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:23.964
Mr. Johnny knock
all the teeth out his head.

01:04:23.966 --> 01:04:26.366
So he learned how to do
everything with his feet.

01:04:26.368 --> 01:04:32.138
Up till he got this, uh, fungus.
It grew--

01:04:32.140 --> 01:04:35.375
- Stop it.
- I'm trying to tell you
about overcoming adversity.

01:04:35.377 --> 01:04:38.378
Listen, you want to talk to me
about my grip, fine.

01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:42.916
- Talk about my swing, fine.
- You don't wanna hear
about the fungus ?

01:04:42.918 --> 01:04:46.086
He became a dancer.
Oh, he made a fortune.

01:04:46.088 --> 01:04:51.591
It was the most amazing thing
to see this armless, toothless
man sliding across the stage...

01:04:51.593 --> 01:04:54.194
to the music
of Bessie Smith and the Duke.

01:04:56.231 --> 01:04:59.132
I don't care
if I'm 12 strokes back.
I just don't.

01:04:59.134 --> 01:05:02.035
<i> You don't even want
 to win ?</i>

01:05:02.037 --> 01:05:05.405
- It's just a game, Bagger.
- Ah.  Yes, sir.

01:05:05.407 --> 01:05:08.141
You done said it yourself now.
Just a game.

01:05:08.143 --> 01:05:12.078
<i> So maybe, just maybe,
 there is something else
 that's rilin' you.</i>

01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:15.415
Maybe you thought
you was just gonna sashay
out onto that green...

01:05:15.417 --> 01:05:20.253
and the old hero of Savannah
just reappear all by hisself.

01:05:20.255 --> 01:05:22.689
Don't work that way,
is all.

01:05:22.691 --> 01:05:25.292
<i> The Junuh you was, you
 ain't never gonna be again.</i>

01:05:26.695 --> 01:05:29.596
Ever.
That's all I'm sayin'.

01:05:31.166 --> 01:05:33.400
You don't know
a damn thing about me.

01:05:33.402 --> 01:05:36.403
I know one thing for sure.
You gonna look pretty foolish...

01:05:36.405 --> 01:05:38.405
with two different shoes
on your feet.

01:05:38.407 --> 01:05:40.707
<i> Ah, Jesus.</i>

01:05:40.709 --> 01:05:43.610
You got an answer
for everything,
don't you, Bagger ?

01:05:43.612 --> 01:05:48.281
Let me tell you something.
There's no difference
between winning and losing...

01:05:48.283 --> 01:05:50.717
and anything in between.

01:05:50.719 --> 01:05:53.720
What's lost is lost.
A man lives.  A man dies.

01:05:55.123 --> 01:05:57.424
And in the end
it all turns out the same.

01:05:57.426 --> 01:06:00.593
You're alone.
And that's all
you're ever gonna be.

01:06:00.595 --> 01:06:04.064
Is that a fact ?
Alone.

01:06:04.066 --> 01:06:07.434
So, a soul is born
with everything
that the Lord can give it,

01:06:07.436 --> 01:06:11.438
and things don't go its way, so
it just gives up, and the good
Lord takes everything back ?

01:06:11.440 --> 01:06:15.976
- That's right.
- And then the soul dies.

01:06:15.978 --> 01:06:20.613
- Alone.  Was that pretty much
what you're sayin' ?
- That's right.

01:06:20.615 --> 01:06:24.084
That's a sad story,
Mr. Junuh.

01:06:24.086 --> 01:06:28.488
<i>Yes, it is.
 And that's just about
 the dumbest thing...</i>

01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:32.258
I heard any fool say...
ever.

01:06:32.260 --> 01:06:37.063
<i> You got yourself a hard eye
 there, Mr. Junuh.</i>

01:06:37.065 --> 01:06:40.233
Soul is born with everything,
it dies, and the good Lord--

01:06:40.235 --> 01:06:42.502
You're a funny man,
Mr. Junuh.

01:06:42.504 --> 01:06:47.307
Now, what I hear,
Bobby's just waitin'
to make his big move.

01:06:47.309 --> 01:06:49.309
He doesn't wanna
peak too early.

01:06:49.311 --> 01:06:51.578
You think Walter
doesn't know that ?

01:06:51.580 --> 01:06:54.314
He's keeping pace with Bobby
step for step.

01:06:54.316 --> 01:06:59.252
And when Bobby kicks
his game into high gear,
he's in for a big surprise.

01:06:59.254 --> 01:07:01.321
What about Junuh ?

01:07:01.323 --> 01:07:03.556
Well,
what about him, son ?

01:07:03.558 --> 01:07:08.194
Well, there's still
three rounds to go.
And that's 54 holes.

01:07:08.196 --> 01:07:10.330
<i> All he's got to do is
 pick up one stroke...</i>

01:07:10.332 --> 01:07:13.333
every four holes,
and he wins.

01:07:13.335 --> 01:07:17.337
- It's possible.
- Well, it's possible, son,
but it's not very likely.

01:07:17.339 --> 01:07:20.673
I mean, I have been told
that Junuh shows no sign
of gettin' his game together.

01:07:20.675 --> 01:07:23.576
He's playin' Bobby Jones
and Walter Hagen.

01:07:23.578 --> 01:07:27.147
What do you know ?
You can't even get yourself
a decent job !

01:07:27.149 --> 01:07:30.650
Hardy !  Hardy Greaves,
you come back here.

01:07:30.652 --> 01:07:32.619
<i> Let him go, Ida.</i>

01:07:35.323 --> 01:07:38.191
Been a hard time
for the boy.

01:07:47.636 --> 01:07:51.271
There something
you wanted to tell me ?

01:07:54.543 --> 01:07:57.644
Well, I'm tryin' to think of
how to say it, Junuh.

01:08:00.215 --> 01:08:03.116
There is a purpose
to this visit,

01:08:03.118 --> 01:08:06.386
and that's to apologize.

01:08:06.388 --> 01:08:08.721
But I'm not
a naturally apologetic woman,
so it takes me longer...

01:08:08.723 --> 01:08:11.858
to get my thoughts in order.

01:08:11.860 --> 01:08:16.796
I want to seem properly contrite
for having gotten you
into this golf match,

01:08:16.798 --> 01:08:20.800
but not seem that what I did
was ill-intentioned,
because it was not.

01:08:20.801 --> 01:08:24.337
What exactly are you
apologizin' for ?

01:08:26.575 --> 01:08:28.640
For publicly
humiliating you.

01:08:28.643 --> 01:08:33.813
Oh.  Well, that'd
be a good thing
to apologize for.

01:08:33.814 --> 01:08:38.818
However... I think that...

01:08:38.819 --> 01:08:44.224
basically, what I'm
trying to say is--
is that I'm sorry.

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:47.292
But it's not my fault.

01:08:48.363 --> 01:08:50.830
You're the one to blame.

01:08:53.602 --> 01:08:56.368
That's one hell
of an apology, Adele.

01:08:56.371 --> 01:08:58.837
I'd stop the tournament
in a flash, if I could.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:09:03.576
I truly, truly would,
because I know it's just
gonna get worse.

01:09:03.578 --> 01:09:06.379
And the way you're playin' !
You're simply destroyin'
any chance...

01:09:06.381 --> 01:09:08.747
Jones and Hagen have
of playin' well.

01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:13.353
And your supporters,
who are every man,
woman and child in Savannah,

01:09:13.354 --> 01:09:17.390
are so demoralized that
they can barely hold down
their lunches.

01:09:22.596 --> 01:09:27.332
So, you want my apology
or not ?
No.

01:09:29.604 --> 01:09:31.571
Well.

01:09:34.341 --> 01:09:36.341
That's the Junuh
I know.

01:09:36.344 --> 01:09:40.212
Just full
of little surprises.
What was it, Adele ?

01:09:41.616 --> 01:09:43.582
What did you like about us ?

01:09:48.290 --> 01:09:50.557
I liked the way
we danced.

01:09:55.931 --> 01:09:56.829
What's your problem ?

01:10:02.370 --> 01:10:06.739
And they was just lookin' at me
like I was stupid or crazy
or something.

01:10:06.741 --> 01:10:10.910
To think that you could beat
Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen
bein' 12 strokes behind,

01:10:10.912 --> 01:10:14.380
even though I told them
all you had to do was
pick up one stroke...

01:10:14.382 --> 01:10:18.585
every four holes
of the next 54 holes, right ?

01:10:18.587 --> 01:10:20.520
Yeah, right.
And who do you think
was tellin' me...

01:10:20.522 --> 01:10:22.522
what a hopeless case
you was the most ?

01:10:22.524 --> 01:10:26.526
My very own father,
who says that he was
a good friend of yours...

01:10:26.528 --> 01:10:28.695
until you lost your mind
in the war.

01:10:28.697 --> 01:10:30.697
<i> He's right.</i>

01:10:30.699 --> 01:10:33.533
You can't win ?

01:10:33.535 --> 01:10:36.336
He was a good friend
of mine.

01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:44.544
He's sweepin' streets,
Captain Junuh...

01:10:44.546 --> 01:10:48.314
in the middle of Savannah
where everybody can see him.

01:10:48.316 --> 01:10:51.751
Me, my friends
and everybody.

01:10:51.753 --> 01:10:55.321
You feelin' sorry for yourself
because your daddy's
got to sweep streets ?

01:10:55.323 --> 01:10:57.657
He ain't the only man
who can't get work.

01:10:57.659 --> 01:10:59.892
Wilbur Charles's dad
can't get work neither,

01:10:59.894 --> 01:11:04.731
but he says he'd rather do
nothin' at all than something
beneath his dignity.

01:11:06.635 --> 01:11:11.337
Grow up, Hardy.
It ain't time for me
to grow up, Mr. Junuh.

01:11:11.339 --> 01:11:15.041
Your daddy's out
sweepin' streets because he took
every last dime he had...

01:11:15.043 --> 01:11:17.610
and used it to pay up
every man and woman he owed...

01:11:17.612 --> 01:11:20.680
and every business
who worked for him, instead of
declaring bankruptcy...

01:11:20.682 --> 01:11:24.984
like everyone else in town,
including your best friend
Wilbur Charles's dad, Raymond,

01:11:24.986 --> 01:11:27.754
which is why he's able
to sit around all day long
on his dignity.

01:11:29.658 --> 01:11:31.791
You daddy stared adversity
in the eye, Hardy,

01:11:31.793 --> 01:11:34.027
and he beat it back
with a broom.

01:11:50.545 --> 01:11:52.745
You really love this game,
don't you ?

01:11:54.983 --> 01:11:57.550
The greatest game there is.

01:11:57.552 --> 01:11:59.886
You really think so ?

01:11:59.888 --> 01:12:03.723
Ask anybody.
It's fun.  It's hard.

01:12:03.725 --> 01:12:06.492
You stand out there
on that green, green grass,

01:12:06.494 --> 01:12:10.797
and it's just you and the ball,
and there ain't nobody
to beat up on but yourself.

01:12:10.799 --> 01:12:16.636
Just like Mr. Noonan keeps
hittin' himself with a golf club
every time he gets angry.

01:12:16.638 --> 01:12:19.839
He's broken his toe three times
on account of it.

01:12:19.841 --> 01:12:23.943
This is the only game I know
you can call a penalty
on yourself--

01:12:23.945 --> 01:12:26.913
if you're honest,
which most people are.

01:12:26.915 --> 01:12:30.083
There just ain't
no other game like it.

01:12:34.689 --> 01:12:36.589
I better get goin'.

01:12:48.903 --> 01:12:51.738
In case you didn't see that,
Bobby, remind me when we're
out there.

01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:54.574
I'll show you where it's at
when your second shot
catches up to it.

01:13:06.121 --> 01:13:09.555
Oh, yes.
Greatest game there is.

01:13:09.557 --> 01:13:11.724
- Right, Hardy ?
- Yes, sir.

01:13:11.726 --> 01:13:13.793
The greatest game
there will ever be.

01:13:13.795 --> 01:13:17.029
Just you and the ball.
All by your lonesome.

01:13:19.467 --> 01:13:21.100
I think it's time.

01:13:21.102 --> 01:13:24.604
- Time for what ?
- Time for you to see the field.

01:13:24.606 --> 01:13:29.809
The field ?
I see the field.
It's 445 yards long.

01:13:29.811 --> 01:13:33.646
It's got a little red flag
at the end of it.
It's 12 strokes ahead of me.

01:13:33.648 --> 01:13:35.982
<i> Come on.
 That ain't it.</i>

01:13:35.984 --> 01:13:39.185
'Cause if you was seein'
the field, you wouldn't be
hackin' at that ball...

01:13:39.187 --> 01:13:42.054
like you was choppin' weeds out
from under your front porch.

01:13:42.056 --> 01:13:45.158
Just gimme the club.

01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:48.194
Sorry I bring it up.  Here.
You gonna take that.
Hack away.

01:14:05.847 --> 01:14:08.080
All right.
What's the field ?

01:14:09.984 --> 01:14:11.951
Fix your eyes
on Bobby Jones.

01:14:14.055 --> 01:14:16.689
Here's a piece of work
here right now.

01:14:16.691 --> 01:14:18.624
Give the man room.

01:14:18.626 --> 01:14:20.560
Knock it out there,
Bobby.

01:14:40.682 --> 01:14:42.615
Look at his practice swing.

01:14:44.752 --> 01:14:48.187
Almost like he was
searchin' for somethin'.

01:14:48.189 --> 01:14:51.190
Then he finds it.

01:14:51.192 --> 01:14:54.160
Watch how he settle hisself
right into the middle of it.

01:14:57.198 --> 01:14:59.198
Feel that focus.

01:15:02.103 --> 01:15:04.036
He got a lot of shots
he could choose from.

01:15:05.206 --> 01:15:07.773
Duffs and tops and skulls.

01:15:10.879 --> 01:15:14.881
But there's only one shot
that's in perfect harmony
with the field.

01:15:16.084 --> 01:15:20.152
One shot that's his.
Authentic shot.

01:15:22.724 --> 01:15:24.724
And that shot
is gonna choose him.

01:15:26.895 --> 01:15:30.830
There's a perfect shot
out there tryin' to find
each and every one of us.

01:15:30.832 --> 01:15:34.166
All we gotta do is get
ourselves out of its way.

01:15:34.168 --> 01:15:36.168
Let it choose us.

01:15:38.907 --> 01:15:42.174
Mm.  Look at him.
He in the field.

01:15:52.921 --> 01:15:57.189
Can't see that flag
as some dragon you got to slay.

01:15:57.191 --> 01:15:59.859
You got to look
with soft eyes.

01:15:59.861 --> 01:16:03.829
See the place
where the tides and seasons...

01:16:03.831 --> 01:16:05.932
and the turnin' of the earth...

01:16:05.934 --> 01:16:08.067
all come together.

01:16:09.103 --> 01:16:12.004
Where everything that is...

01:16:12.006 --> 01:16:13.940
becomes one.

01:16:15.643 --> 01:16:19.745
You got to seek that place
with your soul, Junuh.

01:16:32.727 --> 01:16:35.695
Seek it with your hands.
Don't think about it.

01:16:35.697 --> 01:16:40.099
Feel it.
Your hands is wiser than
your head ever gonna be.

01:16:42.170 --> 01:16:44.203
I can't take you there,
Junuh.

01:16:46.007 --> 01:16:48.874
Just hopes I can help you
find a way.

01:16:57.785 --> 01:17:02.021
Just you, that ball,

01:17:02.023 --> 01:17:04.023
that flag,

01:17:06.394 --> 01:17:08.761
and all you are--
seek it with your hands.

01:17:08.763 --> 01:17:11.130
Don't think about it.  Feel it.
You're lookin' at it, Junuh.

01:17:16.671 --> 01:17:20.172
Your authentic swing.
That flag.

01:17:20.174 --> 01:17:22.742
And all that you are.

01:18:20.935 --> 01:18:24.203
Even the blind squirrel finds
an acorn now and then, Bobby.

01:18:34.482 --> 01:18:38.084
The rest of that afternoon
is a blur.

01:18:38.086 --> 01:18:41.954
Junuh kept asking question
after question about the field,

01:18:41.956 --> 01:18:44.857
while Bagger just acted like
nothin' much had happened...

01:18:44.859 --> 01:18:48.494
and kept makin' remarks
about how much Hagen's socks
must have cost...

01:18:48.496 --> 01:18:52.431
and how long
to dry tobacco leaves
before they make a good smoke.

01:18:56.804 --> 01:18:58.904
But somehow,
in the middle of it all,

01:18:58.906 --> 01:19:01.207
Junuh started playin' golf.

01:19:17.258 --> 01:19:22.128
As the day and the second round
came to an end, there was
genuine excitement.

01:19:22.130 --> 01:19:25.197
I do so enjoy
this little game.

01:19:28.402 --> 01:19:32.404
Why don't you ladies
freshen up, and I'd love you
to join me for dinner.

01:19:35.543 --> 01:19:38.444
Hello, Hugh.
Junuh.

01:19:40.148 --> 01:19:42.915
I'll have a double Scotch.
All right, sir.

01:19:42.917 --> 01:19:45.217
Pretty entertaining out there
today, huh ?

01:19:45.219 --> 01:19:48.187
That's what the people want.
Entertainment.

01:19:52.794 --> 01:19:56.228
I got a proposition, Junuh.
Exhibitions are the thing now.

01:19:56.230 --> 01:19:59.298
Five, ten grand
for two days' work.

01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:02.234
How'd you like to go
on tour with me ?
We'd have some good matches.

01:20:02.236 --> 01:20:06.939
I'd expect to win, of course.
But then we'd split the money
70 - 30 afterwards.

01:20:06.941 --> 01:20:09.308
You'd get the 30.

01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:13.145
Oh, don't get me wrong.
I'm not just lookin'
for another payday here.

01:20:13.147 --> 01:20:15.314
I couldn't breathe if it
weren't for this game of golf.

01:20:15.316 --> 01:20:19.485
I once had the next king
of England hold the pin for me
while I putted !

01:20:19.487 --> 01:20:24.056
Did you know that ?
I did.

01:20:24.058 --> 01:20:28.227
Yes.  I've paid back
everything that golf gave me
several times over.

01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:30.129
But now I'm
on the receiving end.

01:20:32.533 --> 01:20:34.266
Whoo.
It's the good life, Junuh.

01:20:35.837 --> 01:20:38.971
Why me ?
The crowd likes you.

01:20:38.973 --> 01:20:42.942
I think we have a lot
in common, you and I.

01:20:42.944 --> 01:20:48.013
You've got no illusions that
there's anything out there
worth gettin' riled up about.

01:20:48.015 --> 01:20:52.284
The meaning of it all
is that there is no meaning.

01:20:52.286 --> 01:20:54.286
Ah, you'd be good company.
That's all I'm sayin'.

01:20:56.524 --> 01:20:58.524
Thanks, Walter.
I'll think it over.

01:20:58.526 --> 01:21:02.895
Hey.  I admire the way you're
dealing with this match, Junuh.

01:21:02.897 --> 01:21:06.232
Fighting the way you are.
It's damn noble.

01:21:06.234 --> 01:21:08.601
But no matter how good
a fighter you are,

01:21:08.603 --> 01:21:12.905
just remember, I can ask
the king to hold the flag
for me when I putt.

01:21:12.907 --> 01:21:17.543
But he's not gonna give me
his crown.  Neither is Bobby,
and neither am I.

01:21:17.545 --> 01:21:20.446
I'm not asking
for your crown, Walter.

01:21:20.448 --> 01:21:22.248
If I wanted it bad enough,
I'd just take it.

01:21:37.164 --> 01:21:41.166
¶¶

01:22:15.303 --> 01:22:18.938
Was there something you wished
to discuss ?  Because this might
not be the right time to--

01:22:31.485 --> 01:22:34.320
I can win, Adele.

01:22:34.322 --> 01:22:36.322
I can beat both of 'em.

01:22:37.959 --> 01:22:41.527
Look in my eyes
and tell me what you see.

01:22:41.529 --> 01:22:44.396
Determination.
Pure determination.

01:22:44.398 --> 01:22:48.734
Panic, Adele.
Pure panic.

01:22:48.736 --> 01:22:52.404
I'm eight strokes behind
the two greatest golfers
in the history of the sport.

01:22:52.406 --> 01:22:55.074
They've never blown a lead
in their lives, and I'm
gonna win.  You know why ?

01:22:55.076 --> 01:22:56.976
Panic ?
That's right.

01:22:59.046 --> 01:23:02.414
Oh, Junuh.
You don't, by any chance--
Yes.

01:23:05.419 --> 01:23:09.321
Oh, I ought to go back
to my guests.

01:23:10.691 --> 01:23:12.691
Yes.  I should go back
to my guests.

01:23:12.693 --> 01:23:15.194
You-- You will
stay in touch ?

01:23:15.196 --> 01:23:18.197
I don't think I can
wait another 12 years
for the next installment.

01:23:21.035 --> 01:23:23.335
Was there something about me
that you particularly missed ?

01:23:23.337 --> 01:23:28.073
Something that I can feel
gratified about depriving you
of all these years ?

01:23:28.075 --> 01:23:30.376
I like the way we danced.

01:23:41.689 --> 01:23:44.723
Make sure you got enough balls
in there.  Got another sweater ?

01:23:44.725 --> 01:23:46.725
Got enough water ?
Driver.  I need the driver.

01:23:46.727 --> 01:23:49.094
This is gonna take
everything I got.

01:23:49.096 --> 01:23:51.764
Oh, that's for sure.
That's a jigger.
Help you keep it under the wind.

01:23:51.766 --> 01:23:54.566
<i> Bagger, my putter's got
 more loft than this thing.</i>

01:23:54.568 --> 01:23:57.636
Well, actually,
they just about the same.
Oh.  Well, that's good.

01:23:57.638 --> 01:24:01.240
I'll just putt the ball
down the fairway, then.
Anything else ?

01:24:02.543 --> 01:24:05.344
Just bash the livin' shit
out of it.

01:24:09.650 --> 01:24:12.184
An iron.

01:24:12.186 --> 01:24:14.420
Well, I don't suppose
it matters much
what club you use...

01:24:14.422 --> 01:24:16.422
<i> when you start the day
 eight strokes back.</i>

01:24:42.083 --> 01:24:44.383
- What club was that ?
- Mid-iron.

01:24:44.385 --> 01:24:48.153
Some kind of driving iron.
Extraordinarily well-hit.

01:25:04.839 --> 01:25:09.741
<i>- The flag !
  Pull the flag, Hardy.
 - Yes, sir.</i>

01:25:09.743 --> 01:25:13.312
Junuh eagled, pickin' up two
strokes on the very first hole.

01:25:18.285 --> 01:25:21.620
And he picked up another stroke
when Jones bogeyed the second.

01:25:26.627 --> 01:25:30.762
And two more strokes on Hagen
when he double-bogeyed
the third.

01:25:30.764 --> 01:25:35.601
Does it look like
180 yards to you ?
No.

01:25:35.603 --> 01:25:37.503
It's 181.

01:25:39.907 --> 01:25:43.175
You might wanna play that ball
back just a bit in your stance.

01:26:27.488 --> 01:26:30.689
He just hit a hole in one !
Hot dang !

01:26:30.691 --> 01:26:35.194
I just seen a miracle
with my own eyes !
He just hit a hole in one !

01:26:48.309 --> 01:26:51.310
Hey, Homer, you're not gonna believe this !
 Junuh made a hole in one !

01:26:53.981 --> 01:26:57.316
Junuh made a hole in one !
He's gonna make it !

01:26:57.318 --> 01:26:59.318
He's gonna make it !
You're kiddin' !

01:26:59.320 --> 01:27:01.320
What ?

01:27:06.327 --> 01:27:08.227
What's up ?
Junuh's makin'
a run for it.

01:27:08.229 --> 01:27:10.896
<i> He's pulled within three
 of Jones and two of Hagen.</i>

01:27:10.898 --> 01:27:14.866
He made a hole in one on eight !
God bless Savannah
and the men she propagates.

01:27:25.546 --> 01:27:27.512
Let's go.  Let's go !

01:27:37.324 --> 01:27:39.658
Get back. Get back now.

01:27:39.660 --> 01:27:42.794
How do you expect Junuh
to hit the ball if you stand
on top of him ?

01:27:42.796 --> 01:27:44.763
Shh !

01:27:48.335 --> 01:27:51.903
His play in the third round
was beautiful to watch.

01:28:16.830 --> 01:28:20.599
While Jones and Hagen discovered
new hazards of their own,

01:28:24.672 --> 01:28:28.307
Junuh had discovered,
as Bagger so eloquently put it,

01:28:28.309 --> 01:28:31.677
how to stop thinkin'
without fallin' asleep.

01:28:35.916 --> 01:28:39.885
Junuh finished the third round
one stroke behind.

01:28:39.887 --> 01:28:44.756
It was a new match,
and no one knew it better
than Jones and Hagen.

01:28:44.758 --> 01:28:47.826
Not now, girls.
Not now.

01:28:56.403 --> 01:28:59.738
Gents.

01:29:04.078 --> 01:29:07.079
Don't believe Walter planned
on exerting himself.

01:29:10.384 --> 01:29:12.651
It was fun this morning,
wasn't it ?

01:29:13.721 --> 01:29:15.654
Yeah, it was.

01:29:17.858 --> 01:29:19.991
This is my last match, Junuh.
I'm retiring.

01:29:25.566 --> 01:29:28.367
You're at the top
of your game.

01:29:28.369 --> 01:29:32.070
I've got a wife and three small
children and a law practice.

01:29:32.072 --> 01:29:33.939
It's time to stop.

01:29:40.814 --> 01:29:44.416
It's just a game, Junuh.

01:29:44.418 --> 01:29:48.820
You know, I'll never forget
you winnin' the Georgia Open
in 1916.

01:29:50.824 --> 01:29:53.725
I'd never seen
a swing so sweet...

01:29:53.727 --> 01:29:55.694
or a man get
so much pleasure from it.

01:29:59.833 --> 01:30:03.101
This is my last 18 holes,
Junuh.

01:30:03.103 --> 01:30:07.005
And I been thinkin',
I couldn't have picked
a better way to end it.

01:30:07.007 --> 01:30:11.443
- Thank you, Bobby.
- It is truly my pleasure.

01:30:13.814 --> 01:30:17.048
<i> I can't let you win
 out of sympathy.</i>

01:30:17.050 --> 01:30:19.117
You know that.

01:30:19.119 --> 01:30:21.686
I do.

01:30:21.688 --> 01:30:24.156
And I have no intentions
of losing my last match.

01:30:57.124 --> 01:31:00.091
Gentlemen, excuse me, excuse me.
Let's give Mr. Junuh some room.

01:31:00.093 --> 01:31:03.028
Thank you.  Thank you.
I'd like to have a word
with you, Junuh.

01:31:03.030 --> 01:31:05.197
I don't think this
is a good time, Adele.

01:31:05.199 --> 01:31:07.999
No.  I think this is
a very good time.

01:31:08.001 --> 01:31:12.137
I don't wanna do anything
that might disrupt your
concentration or anything.

01:31:12.139 --> 01:31:15.207
But since our little encounter
last night, I've been thinking.

01:31:18.779 --> 01:31:21.780
Ten years and not one single
solitary word from you ?

01:31:21.782 --> 01:31:24.149
You don't do that
to someone you love.

01:31:24.151 --> 01:31:29.154
I deserve better.  I deserved
some correspondence and some
indication of what you felt !

01:31:29.156 --> 01:31:31.957
Oh, Junuh, I don't know
what happened to you.

01:31:31.959 --> 01:31:36.728
But whatever it was, it could
not have been as unbearable...

01:31:36.730 --> 01:31:39.965
as a woman waitin'
with no end in sight,

01:31:39.967 --> 01:31:44.102
wonderin' if she's
remembered or forgotten
by the man she loves.

01:31:45.772 --> 01:31:49.007
You never even said
you were sorry.

01:31:49.009 --> 01:31:53.178
And now I'm supposed to just
run into your arms and melt
like butter on a hot muffin ?

01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:57.582
I'm sorry, Adele.
I am.  Truly sorry.

01:31:57.584 --> 01:31:59.751
It's too late
for "I'm sorry," Junuh !

01:31:59.753 --> 01:32:03.088
But--  Then--
Tell me what to say.

01:32:03.090 --> 01:32:05.056
It was too long ago.

01:32:06.927 --> 01:32:08.793
No, it wasn't.

01:32:10.197 --> 01:32:12.130
It was just
a moment ago.

01:32:15.202 --> 01:32:17.969
Did something happen
since we talked last night ?

01:32:21.208 --> 01:32:23.208
No.

01:32:24.945 --> 01:32:27.212
Not that I can think of.

01:32:32.119 --> 01:32:34.920
Well, this is barely
the place to talk about it.

01:32:34.922 --> 01:32:36.955
You gotta go back
to your game.

01:33:02.249 --> 01:33:06.251
This town is gonna give you
the biggest damn parade
you ever seen !

01:33:14.127 --> 01:33:17.762
Junuh was playin'
a fierce fourth round.

01:33:17.764 --> 01:33:21.600
And a wild thought began
to percolate through the crowd.

01:33:21.602 --> 01:33:23.101
Junuh could win.

01:33:27.240 --> 01:33:29.240
<i>- I think the driver, Bagger.
-  Hey, give us a smile.</i>

01:33:32.245 --> 01:33:35.747
Well, you got water out there
on the left side.  Why don't
you put your spoon out there...

01:33:35.749 --> 01:33:38.049
with Jones and Hagen,
play this thing smart ?

01:33:38.051 --> 01:33:41.853
<i> I'm gonna hug the left,
 get there in two and close
 the door on these guys.</i>

01:33:41.855 --> 01:33:46.891
Get ahold of yourself now.
We got four more holes to go.
You settle down a little bit.

01:33:46.893 --> 01:33:51.763
I never been more settled.
An eagle, and this thing
is over.

01:34:10.217 --> 01:34:12.851
Oh, that's 300 or more yards
if it's an inch.

01:34:18.759 --> 01:34:22.060
Looks like the longest drive
of the day, Mr. Junuh.

01:34:22.062 --> 01:34:23.895
I'm gettin' there
in two.

01:34:26.733 --> 01:34:31.069
Two twenty-five into the wind,
out of the bunker.

01:34:31.071 --> 01:34:35.240
Geez. The lip's too high.
So much for an eagle.

01:34:35.242 --> 01:34:37.776
Says who ?

01:34:37.778 --> 01:34:40.111
Where's that drivin' iron,
Bagger ?

01:34:40.113 --> 01:34:45.817
Well, there's a time to hit
that shot, and there's a time
to leave it in the bag.

01:34:45.819 --> 01:34:48.687
Which one of them times
you feel this is ?

01:35:02.269 --> 01:35:04.269
Tell him.
Tell him, Bagger.

01:35:04.271 --> 01:35:07.706
Tell him it's a mashie, so he
can have one easy shot to--

01:35:07.708 --> 01:35:13.111
That's amazing.
The man's gonna go for the green
with that cleeky lookin' thing ?

01:35:13.113 --> 01:35:15.714
He's got the guts
of a Greek god.

01:35:15.716 --> 01:35:18.083
I don't care
if he's Apollo,
son of Zeus.

01:35:18.085 --> 01:35:21.252
<i> That ball won't clear
 the water.</i>

01:35:21.254 --> 01:35:24.422
I hope you're all
payin' customers.

01:36:02.996 --> 01:36:06.264
Junuh !  Junuh, don't--
Shh.  Hush yourself,
Hardy.

01:36:06.266 --> 01:36:10.235
If first
you don't succeed.

01:36:34.995 --> 01:36:38.263
Which would make your spot...

01:36:38.265 --> 01:36:40.932
right here, Junuh.

01:36:42.569 --> 01:36:45.270
Give it to him.

01:37:14.034 --> 01:37:16.301
When Junuh dropped that ball,

01:37:16.303 --> 01:37:20.238
it was as if every heart
in Savannah dropped with it,

01:37:21.608 --> 01:37:24.242
none landing harder
than his own.

01:39:19.492 --> 01:39:22.193
You gonna be wantin'
a different club there, Junuh ?

01:39:29.202 --> 01:39:31.602
<i>I can't do this.
 Well--</i>

01:39:31.604 --> 01:39:35.273
Why don't you just loose
your grip up a smidge ?

01:39:35.275 --> 01:39:38.076
<i> A man's grip on
 his club is--
 That's not
 what I'm talkin' about.</i>

01:39:38.078 --> 01:39:42.113
- I know.
- No, you don't.

01:39:42.115 --> 01:39:44.549
What I'm talkin' about
is a game.

01:39:44.551 --> 01:39:47.518
Game that can't be won.
Only played.

01:39:47.520 --> 01:39:49.520
You don't understand.

01:39:49.522 --> 01:39:53.057
I don't need
to understand.

01:39:53.059 --> 01:39:57.295
Ain't a soul on this entire
earth ain't got a burden
to carry he don't understand.

01:39:57.297 --> 01:39:59.297
<i> You ain't alone in that.</i>

01:39:59.299 --> 01:40:02.300
But you been carryin' this one
long enough.

01:40:02.302 --> 01:40:05.737
Time to go on.
Lay it down.

01:40:08.675 --> 01:40:10.575
I don't know how.

01:40:12.612 --> 01:40:16.581
You got a choice.
You can stop.

01:40:16.583 --> 01:40:20.485
- Or you can start.
- Start ?

01:40:20.487 --> 01:40:22.320
<i>- Walkin'.
 - Where ?</i>

01:40:22.322 --> 01:40:24.322
Right back to where
you always been.

01:40:24.324 --> 01:40:26.758
<i> And then stand there.</i>

01:40:28.028 --> 01:40:31.295
Still.  Real still.

01:40:31.297 --> 01:40:34.332
- And remember.
- It's too long ago.

01:40:34.334 --> 01:40:37.735
Oh, no, sir.
It was just a moment ago.

01:40:41.808 --> 01:40:45.343
Time for you to come on
out the shadows, Junuh.

01:40:47.547 --> 01:40:49.680
Time for you to choose.

01:40:55.055 --> 01:40:57.755
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

01:40:57.757 --> 01:40:59.724
But you ain't alone.

01:41:00.827 --> 01:41:02.727
I'm right here with ya.

01:41:04.197 --> 01:41:06.364
I been here all along.

01:41:13.406 --> 01:41:15.406
Now, play the game.

01:41:15.408 --> 01:41:19.343
Your game.
The one that only you
was meant to play.

01:41:19.345 --> 01:41:22.213
The one that was given to you
when you come into this world.

01:41:32.358 --> 01:41:34.358
You ready ?

01:41:36.696 --> 01:41:38.663
Take your stance.

01:41:44.370 --> 01:41:48.172
Strike that ball, Junuh.
Don't hold nothin' back.
Give it everything.

01:41:48.174 --> 01:41:49.841
Now's the time.

01:41:49.843 --> 01:41:54.712
<i>Let yourself remember.
Rememberyour swing.</i>

01:41:56.716 --> 01:42:01.219
That's right, Junuh.
Settle yourself.  Let's go.

01:42:01.221 --> 01:42:03.154
Now is the time, Junuh.

01:42:47.333 --> 01:42:49.233
Let's go, Hardy.

01:42:54.641 --> 01:42:56.841
Hey, Bagger ?
Yeah ?

01:42:56.843 --> 01:42:58.943
You are one hell
of a caddie.

01:42:58.945 --> 01:43:03.548
Well, I do the best
with what I got to work with.
We ain't done yet.

01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:24.368
By the 17th, Junuh
got his swing back.

01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:32.476
You have the right to call the
game on account of darkness.

01:43:32.478 --> 01:43:35.313
That crowd'll
string us up by our thumbs
if we don't finish.

01:43:40.553 --> 01:43:44.989
All right !
Play will continue !

01:44:03.543 --> 01:44:05.476
Oh !

01:44:09.716 --> 01:44:12.283
This is when a man needs pals
in the mermaids' union.

01:45:06.673 --> 01:45:09.073
Cars !  Get your cars, boys !

01:45:09.075 --> 01:45:13.844
I want every car
on this property lined up
with lights blazin' !

01:45:13.846 --> 01:45:16.480
I don't care if you're
kitchen help or Savannah police.

01:45:16.482 --> 01:45:19.684
If you got a car,
get it in gear !

01:45:36.703 --> 01:45:39.704
What's his mark ?
It was out of bounds.

01:45:39.706 --> 01:45:42.740
Does he have a shot ?

01:45:42.742 --> 01:45:45.976
Then Hagen came back
from the dead.

01:45:52.852 --> 01:45:55.019
Can I get a smoke ?

01:45:55.021 --> 01:45:58.055
I want you to tell Spec to hold
the flag in case I make it.
He'll love that.

01:45:58.057 --> 01:45:59.490
I want a three iron.

01:46:03.796 --> 01:46:05.730
Get my shoes,
will ya ?

01:46:11.904 --> 01:46:13.904
Hey, what's goin' on ?

01:46:13.906 --> 01:46:16.607
Hagen wants Spec
to hold the flag for him
in case he sinks it.

01:46:16.609 --> 01:46:18.476
I'm gonna miss
playing Walter.

01:46:57.150 --> 01:46:59.583
Don't hold nothin' back.

01:47:18.104 --> 01:47:20.938
- The ball moved.
- No.

01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:23.674
It moved.

01:47:25.111 --> 01:47:27.111
I have to call a stroke
on myself.

01:47:32.685 --> 01:47:34.819
No !

01:47:34.821 --> 01:47:38.088
No.  Don't do it.
Please don't do it.

01:47:38.090 --> 01:47:40.624
Only you and me seen it,
and I won't tell a soul.

01:47:40.626 --> 01:47:43.127
Cross my heart.
Ain't nobody gonna know.

01:47:44.931 --> 01:47:47.731
I will, Hardy.

01:47:47.733 --> 01:47:49.567
And so will you.

01:47:52.138 --> 01:47:55.139
You've got to tell him
not to do it, Bagger !

01:47:55.141 --> 01:47:57.141
It's just a stupid rule
that don't mean nothin'.

01:47:57.143 --> 01:48:00.077
That's a choice
for Mr. Junuh, Hardy.

01:48:02.748 --> 01:48:04.782
No one wanted the penalty
assessed,

01:48:04.784 --> 01:48:07.117
not even Jones and Hagen.

01:48:07.119 --> 01:48:09.520
This was no way to win a match.

01:48:09.522 --> 01:48:14.758
Maybe you're mistaken, Junuh.
Maybe it moved before you
touched the impediment.

01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:18.128
Might not have moved at all.
The light plays funny tricks
this time of day.

01:48:18.130 --> 01:48:23.133
"A ball is deemed to have moved
if it leaves its original
position in the least degree,

01:48:23.135 --> 01:48:27.771
but not if it merely oscillates
and comes to rest in its
original position."

01:48:30.610 --> 01:48:33.143
Is she different ?

01:48:33.145 --> 01:48:36.747
<i> Can you be certain ?
 Sometimes a ball
 will shudder...</i>

01:48:36.749 --> 01:48:39.149
<i> and then settle back
 again, Junuh.</i>

01:48:42.989 --> 01:48:46.824
The ball was here,
and it rolled to here.

01:48:56.569 --> 01:48:59.169
<i> Hit it quick, old boy,
 before you have time
 to think about it.</i>

01:49:26.132 --> 01:49:28.132
You're leaving.

01:49:28.134 --> 01:49:31.335
Yes, sir.
Yes, I am.

01:49:31.337 --> 01:49:33.804
I need you.

01:49:33.806 --> 01:49:37.808
No.  No, you don't.

01:49:37.810 --> 01:49:39.743
Not no more.

01:49:41.247 --> 01:49:45.716
<i> There is a small matter.
 Round about five dollars.</i>

01:49:45.718 --> 01:49:49.153
It was guaranteed.

01:49:49.155 --> 01:49:53.157
- Yes, it was.
- 'Spect you won't be
needin' these shoes back,

01:49:53.159 --> 01:49:57.161
now that I done broke 'em
into my foot and all,
you know.

01:50:02.835 --> 01:50:05.703
Thank you, sir.

01:50:14.847 --> 01:50:16.814
This man is yours,
Hardy.

01:50:17.917 --> 01:50:19.917
Take him on in.

01:50:19.919 --> 01:50:24.989
Y-You want me...
to take over for you ?

01:50:26.626 --> 01:50:30.361
You leavin' me ?
Oh, only for
a little while.

01:50:31.864 --> 01:50:34.865
You pick up Mr. Junuh bag.

01:50:34.867 --> 01:50:37.134
You tote it real straight,
now, you hear ?

01:50:37.136 --> 01:50:39.937
But what if something
comes up...

01:50:39.939 --> 01:50:42.139
and I don't know
what to do ?

01:50:42.141 --> 01:50:45.342
I got a feeling
you'll figure it out.

01:50:47.046 --> 01:50:49.146
But I'll be
seein' ya.

01:51:01.394 --> 01:51:03.994
Whoa, wait a minute.
What's going on here ?

01:51:03.996 --> 01:51:06.130
You can't leave him now.
He needs you, Bagger.

01:51:06.132 --> 01:51:09.133
You're the only chance he's got.
You have to stay.

01:51:09.135 --> 01:51:12.136
You walk out of here like
this, you'll never caddie
in Georgia again,

01:51:12.138 --> 01:51:14.371
I'll personally see to it !
Ya hear ?

01:51:32.858 --> 01:51:35.125
Where's Junuh lie ?

01:51:35.127 --> 01:51:37.695
Two with a penalty.
Could be hittin' three.

01:51:46.138 --> 01:51:49.106
Man.  I can't hit it
any better than that.

01:52:05.324 --> 01:52:09.126
Yes, sir.

01:52:09.128 --> 01:52:13.130
Judging from the sound,
I think I just knocked
your ball in the cup.

01:52:25.144 --> 01:52:27.111
Interesting match.

01:52:28.781 --> 01:52:30.514
I always thought so.

01:52:33.986 --> 01:52:37.488
<i> All right, everybody.
 Comin' through.
 Out of the way.</i>

01:52:43.529 --> 01:52:47.531
Hagen and Jones both lay two,
a shot ahead of Junuh.

01:52:47.533 --> 01:52:51.168
If either of them sank
their putts, Junuh would lose.

01:52:53.205 --> 01:52:55.439
What do you think,
Hardy ?

01:52:57.143 --> 01:53:01.044
Well, the night air
has gotten colder.

01:53:01.046 --> 01:53:05.482
My guess is it's put a layer
of dew on the warmer grass,

01:53:05.484 --> 01:53:08.519
which is gonna
slow your ball down.

01:53:15.027 --> 01:53:17.928
Why don't you go on over
and stand with your father ?

01:53:17.930 --> 01:53:20.230
<i>Are you sure ?
Go ahead.</i>

01:53:20.232 --> 01:53:22.232
Go on.

01:53:33.112 --> 01:53:36.246
That is one tough shot.

01:53:36.248 --> 01:53:38.816
Make it.

01:54:00.906 --> 01:54:03.407
Yeah !

01:56:52.411 --> 01:56:54.745
Rannulph Junuh
from Savannah, Georgia...

01:56:54.747 --> 01:56:58.615
tied Mr. Bobby Jones
and Mr. Walter Hagen...

01:56:58.617 --> 01:57:02.119
in the greatest golf match
the world has ever seen !

01:57:31.216 --> 01:57:33.216
That was the last match
in competition...

01:57:33.218 --> 01:57:35.485
Bobby Jones ever played.

01:57:37.322 --> 01:57:41.558
From that time on,
Walter Hagen played
only exhibition matches.

01:57:53.238 --> 01:57:57.574
As for Captain Rannulph Junuh
and Adele Invergordon,

01:57:59.078 --> 01:58:00.811
they did have that dance.

01:58:18.197 --> 01:58:21.531
And me ?

01:58:21.533 --> 01:58:25.168
Well, it seems like yesterday
I used to see old guys like me,

01:58:25.170 --> 01:58:29.439
wonder why they still bothered
with this crazy game.

01:58:40.619 --> 01:58:42.786
But it doesn't matter.

01:58:42.788 --> 01:58:47.624
As Bagger once said,
it's a game that can't be won,
only played.

01:58:47.626 --> 01:58:51.161
So, I play.
I play on.

01:58:51.163 --> 01:58:54.798
I play for the moments
yet to come,

01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:57.601
lookin' for my place
in the field.
