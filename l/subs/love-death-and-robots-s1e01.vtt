00:34.463 --> 00:37.338
[propeller thumping]

01:24.130 --> 01:25.713
[door slams]

01:25.963 --> 01:29.547
[woman] Wes, you're a beaut.
She's purring like a kitten in there.

01:29.630 --> 01:31.255
Gonna run those tests again.

01:42.047 --> 01:45.172
[Wes] Link's strong.
None of those glitches we had last time.

01:45.255 --> 01:47.672
[woman] That last wetware update
seems to have cleared that up.

01:47.755 --> 01:50.713
Yeah, maybe. But I really think 
we should-- Oh! [chuckles]

01:51.338 --> 01:53.297
-Hello?
-[woman] Yeah?

01:53.380 --> 01:54.588
[Ivrina] There a problem?

01:55.213 --> 01:58.130
-[woman] Can we help you?
-[man] My apologies.

01:58.588 --> 02:02.255
Our little evenings
have become quite popular.

02:03.713 --> 02:05.963
Arthur, their appearance fee.

02:08.422 --> 02:09.672
[Wes] Oh, thank you.

02:12.838 --> 02:14.422
Might I have a peek?

02:15.005 --> 02:17.297
I've heard so much.

02:18.588 --> 02:22.422
Yes. He's magnificent!

02:22.505 --> 02:25.047
Yes. She is.

02:25.130 --> 02:26.172
[man] Oh.

02:27.547 --> 02:30.463
Of course, my apologies, "she".

02:31.047 --> 02:35.588
What would you say if I asked you
to lose tonight's match?

02:37.880 --> 02:38.880
Fuck off.

02:39.547 --> 02:42.338
There's no need to get angry, my dear.

02:43.088 --> 02:45.463
-It's just business.
-[woman 1] Not to me.

02:45.797 --> 02:47.297
[woman 1] I don't dive...

02:47.963 --> 02:49.172
and I don't lose.

02:49.463 --> 02:51.380
And what makes you so special?

02:53.297 --> 02:54.422
I'm not special.

02:55.005 --> 02:56.005
Unique.

02:56.588 --> 02:59.588
No other team uses a female pilot
for their beastie.

02:59.672 --> 03:01.797
[coughing] That's it, then?

03:02.547 --> 03:03.838
Your edge.

03:04.505 --> 03:06.630
Women fight better than men.

03:07.047 --> 03:09.088
-This one does.
-[woman 2] Yeah.

03:09.172 --> 03:10.005
That's my girl.

03:10.088 --> 03:13.755
-Seventeen straight wins to prove it.
-You'll be handsomely paid, of course.

03:13.838 --> 03:15.297
You don't fucking listen, do you?

03:15.380 --> 03:17.547
It may be about money for you,
but for us, it's personal.

03:17.630 --> 03:19.588
Five hundred thousand.

03:22.422 --> 03:23.338
No.

03:25.047 --> 03:27.505
-One insignificant loss for more money...
-Insignificant?

03:27.588 --> 03:28.755
...than you could ever win?

03:28.838 --> 03:30.672
[exhales angrily] Fucking men.

03:30.755 --> 03:33.797
It's cunts like you that
fucked her up to begin with.

03:37.005 --> 03:38.505
[sighs] Fuck.

03:40.463 --> 03:41.297
A year ago,

03:41.880 --> 03:44.213
<i>Sonnie got snatched by an estate gang</i>

03:44.297 --> 03:46.130
<i>and when they was done using her,</i>

03:46.213 --> 03:47.422
<i>they started cutting,</i>

03:47.505 --> 03:50.005
<i>-slicing their marks into her flesh.</i>
-[man laughing in the distance]

03:50.088 --> 03:52.297
<i>Can you imagine that kind of pain,</i>

03:52.380 --> 03:54.172
<i>-that kind of humiliation</i>
-[woman shrieks]

03:54.297 --> 03:56.172
<i>carved into her skin?</i>

03:56.255 --> 03:58.380
<i>A lifelong reminder of that day.</i>

03:59.005 --> 04:03.505
<i>So when Sonnie steps into the pit,</i>
<i>she's not fighting for pride or status</i>

04:03.588 --> 04:06.797
<i>and certainly not for your fucking money.</i>

04:07.755 --> 04:11.338
She's carving up the men
who did this to her.

04:13.297 --> 04:14.713
Very well, then.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.838
I won't press you further.

04:18.130 --> 04:19.672
Piece of shit.

04:25.130 --> 04:27.338
Though I hope you'll reconsider.

04:30.963 --> 04:33.338
[distant hubbub]

04:33.422 --> 04:37.213

05:16.172 --> 05:17.922

05:18.713 --> 05:20.255
You're going down...

05:21.047 --> 05:22.005

05:22.297 --> 05:26.755

05:27.005 --> 05:28.005
You okay in there?

05:28.088 --> 05:29.797
[opponent roars]

05:33.880 --> 05:35.088

05:54.755 --> 05:56.463

[announcer] <i>Comin' in</i>

06:15.963 --> 06:17.130

06:17.338 --> 06:20.297
-I give you...
-And on the move.

06:36.797 --> 06:38.338
[announcer] Can you hear that?

06:40.005 --> 06:44.797
What's coming down...

06:44.880 --> 06:49.047
-Yeah!
-...to tear up the town?

06:49.505 --> 06:53.797

-[man] Oh, no!
-[woman] Steady on there, little man.

10:31.588 --> 10:33.463
[Wes] Think they got
someone to clean that up?

10:33.547 --> 10:35.213
[Ivrina] I don't think
anyone cares, mate.

10:35.297 --> 10:38.297
Well, I might give it five minutes
and if they don't, I will.

10:38.380 --> 10:40.963
-[Ivrina] It's a shit-hole.
-[Wes] That arm. What was that?

10:41.088 --> 10:42.713
[Ivrina] <i>Cheating, that's what it was.</i>

10:42.797 --> 10:45.338
[Wes]<i> But it was made of bone.</i>
<i>That's not against the rules, is it?</i>

10:45.422 --> 10:48.547
[Ivrina] <i>Yeah, I just wanna know how they</i>
<i>engineered that solid piece, that's all.</i>

10:48.630 --> 10:50.755
You thought we were gonna
lose tonight, didn't you?

11:02.130 --> 11:03.130
Can I help you?

11:03.213 --> 11:04.213
[gasps]

11:05.213 --> 11:07.255
This place is...

11:08.130 --> 11:09.005
amazing.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.297
You were amazing.

11:13.713 --> 11:14.547
Thanks.

11:15.422 --> 11:17.963
Look, why are you with--

11:18.047 --> 11:18.880
Dicko?

11:20.547 --> 11:21.963
Security.

11:23.047 --> 11:24.047
Right.

11:25.297 --> 11:26.672
Ever thought of leaving him?

11:27.172 --> 11:28.047
Sometimes.

11:29.630 --> 11:30.755
All the time.

11:32.088 --> 11:33.630
You could come with us.

11:35.338 --> 11:38.422
No. [laughs] 
No, I couldn't.

11:40.047 --> 11:41.005
I envy you.

11:41.963 --> 11:43.338
Your bravery.

11:44.213 --> 11:47.088
I'm maybe even
a little bit frightened of you...

11:49.713 --> 11:51.547
but I'll never be like you.

12:00.463 --> 12:02.047
[gasps]  Oh!

12:06.463 --> 12:09.088
How do you do it, all this...

12:09.672 --> 12:11.922
fighting and hatred?

12:12.005 --> 12:14.172
-Aren't you scared?
-Scared?

12:16.172 --> 12:17.505
All the time.

12:18.588 --> 12:19.838
Now, hate...

12:21.130 --> 12:22.838
that was something I had to learn.

12:23.922 --> 12:25.963
You don't come into this world with hate,

12:26.088 --> 12:28.130
-[woman panting]
-but fear,

12:29.380 --> 12:30.713
-that's primal.
-[woman sighs]

12:31.713 --> 12:33.588
-It fills your senses.
-[woman sighs]

12:34.380 --> 12:37.547
You can see it, hear it...

12:41.088 --> 12:42.213
taste it...

12:44.588 --> 12:46.797
and it keeps me alive.

12:49.880 --> 12:54.755
But that night, the gang, the...

12:56.838 --> 12:57.880
Rape.

12:59.338 --> 13:00.380
Yeah.

13:01.380 --> 13:02.297
It's not that.

13:04.547 --> 13:05.588
They can't see past it.

13:07.713 --> 13:08.922
No one can.

13:10.797 --> 13:12.755
But it ain't what gives me my edge.

13:13.797 --> 13:16.422
Angry little girl, out for revenge.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.547
Dicko believes that shit...

13:20.213 --> 13:21.797
'cause he wants to.

13:23.672 --> 13:24.838
They all do.

13:31.422 --> 13:33.838
Everyone sees what they want to see.

13:37.963 --> 13:39.297
[sighs]

13:51.422 --> 13:52.297
[sighs]

14:00.463 --> 14:02.963
-[gurgling]
-[cane tapping]

14:03.047 --> 14:04.922
[Dicko] Are you scared now?

14:09.422 --> 14:10.588
[groans and gurgles]

14:11.005 --> 14:12.088
[pained grunt]

14:12.172 --> 14:16.005
You made Dicko so very angry.

14:16.713 --> 14:18.005
[gasps]

14:18.088 --> 14:20.005
[Dicko] Silly fucking girl.

14:21.338 --> 14:23.755
Was your pride really worth it?

14:23.838 --> 14:27.047
[gurgling] Neat... trick.

14:36.422 --> 14:39.422
[gurgling] Not... good... enough.

14:40.047 --> 14:43.047
[Sonnie coughs and laughs]

14:45.130 --> 14:46.463
[Dicko] What are you?

14:46.547 --> 14:51.672
[gurgling] Just a couple of 
bioware processors

14:51.755 --> 14:54.047
spliced to a spine.

14:54.838 --> 14:56.380
You're not in there?

14:56.463 --> 14:57.672
[Sonnie] <i>No.</i>

14:57.755 --> 14:59.755
<i>The night Wes and Ivrina found me,</i>

14:59.838 --> 15:01.547
<i>they managed to save that body,</i>

15:01.630 --> 15:04.130
<i>but those estate fucks</i>
<i>had broken my skull.</i>

15:05.005 --> 15:06.880
<i>You wanna know my edge?</i>

15:06.963 --> 15:10.838
<i>Every time I step into that ring,</i>
<i>I'm fighting for my life.</i>

15:10.922 --> 15:14.797
<i>That fear is my edge.</i>

15:15.172 --> 15:16.880
[gasps]  Ahh!

15:18.338 --> 15:22.047
-[Dicko groans]
-[Sonnie] <i>That fear of death.</i>

15:23.297 --> 15:25.672
<i>-Do you feel it?</i>
<i>-</i>[growls]

15:25.755 --> 15:27.047
Please!

15:30.172 --> 15:32.130
[Sonnie whispers] <i>Are you scared now?</i>
