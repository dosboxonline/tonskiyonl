WEBVTT

02:48.450 --> 02:51.460
They actually pay you for this,

02:51.460 --> 02:53.460
to tag beaver?

02:53.460 --> 02:56.460
Imagine.

02:56.460 --> 02:57.460
Was that, like, sarcastic?

02:57.460 --> 03:00.470
'Cause I know what you
Fish and Game guys think

03:00.470 --> 03:02.470
of county sheriffs.

03:02.470 --> 03:04.470
We know you like to
give these one-word,

03:04.470 --> 03:06.480
sarcastic answers.

03:06.480 --> 03:09.480
Gee.

03:09.480 --> 03:10.480
You ask me,

03:10.480 --> 03:12.480
what an animal does in the wild

03:12.480 --> 03:14.490
is his own business.

03:14.490 --> 03:17.490
So long as he
doesn't do it to man.

03:17.490 --> 03:19.490
I think Mark Twain said that.

03:19.490 --> 03:21.500
Yeah, I think he didn't.

03:21.500 --> 03:25.500
But since you said it,
I guess we're covered.

03:42.520 --> 03:46.530
Everyone's a comedian, sarcastic.

05:07.630 --> 05:08.630
I'm sleepin'.

05:08.630 --> 05:10.630
And right in the middle
of a good dream.

05:10.630 --> 05:12.640
And all at once I wake up.

05:12.640 --> 05:16.640
From something that keeps
knocking at my brain.

05:16.640 --> 05:18.640
Before I go in sane.

05:18.640 --> 05:22.650
I hold my pillow to my head...

05:54.690 --> 05:58.690
Aah! Aah!

05:59.700 --> 06:01.700
So what am I so afraid of.

06:01.700 --> 06:03.700
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of...

06:03.700 --> 06:05.700
Help!

06:08.710 --> 06:10.710
I think I love you.

06:10.710 --> 06:13.710
Isn't that what life is made of.

06:13.710 --> 06:15.720
Though it worries...

06:15.720 --> 06:16.720
Aah ha!

06:16.720 --> 06:18.720
Ohh! Ohh!

06:18.720 --> 06:22.720
No! Aah!

06:39.750 --> 06:44.750
Aah!

06:48.760 --> 06:50.760
Ohh! Don't let go!

06:50.760 --> 06:54.770
Oh ho ho!

06:56.770 --> 07:00.770
Aah!

07:07.780 --> 07:11.790
Aw, Jesus Christ.

07:27.810 --> 07:29.810
Kelly?

07:29.810 --> 07:31.810
Hey, Kevin.

07:31.810 --> 07:32.820
Hi.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.820
Listen, uh, could I
Steal you for a minute?

07:46.830 --> 07:47.830
What are you doing?

07:47.830 --> 07:49.840
Heavy breathing, meditating.

07:49.840 --> 07:50.840
Meditating?

07:50.840 --> 07:52.840
Yes. To relieve stress.

07:52.840 --> 07:53.840
Remember, Myra, you're the one

07:53.840 --> 07:55.840
who taught me all about breathing.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.850
Yes, but you're doing Lamaze.
Are you giving birth?

07:57.850 --> 08:00.850
If you're upset,
long, deep breaths.

08:04.860 --> 08:05.860
Kevin dumped me.

08:05.860 --> 08:09.860
I know.

08:09.860 --> 08:10.860
He told you?

08:10.860 --> 08:14.870
Well, I sort of had, uh,
inside information.

08:19.880 --> 08:20.880
You?

08:20.880 --> 08:22.880
It started before you, Kelly.

08:22.880 --> 08:23.880
I never would have--

08:23.880 --> 08:24.880
You?

08:24.880 --> 08:27.880
It was just a quick thing
That we thought was over,

08:27.880 --> 08:29.890
and...it's not over.

08:29.890 --> 08:31.890
You and Kevin.

08:31.890 --> 08:35.890
I--I wish I could
say something to...

08:35.890 --> 08:39.900
the heart wants
what the heart wants.

08:50.910 --> 08:51.920
Sheriff Keough?

08:51.920 --> 08:52.920
Yeah.

08:52.920 --> 08:55.920
Fish and Game.
Jack Wells.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.920
Any recent bear attacks?

08:57.920 --> 08:58.920
This was no bear.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.930
Bears don't attack
people underwater.

09:00.930 --> 09:03.930
Probably a beaver, then.

09:03.930 --> 09:07.930
Ah, a whole sentence sarcastic.

09:16.950 --> 09:19.950
That the way
he came out of the water?

09:19.950 --> 09:23.960
Yeah.

09:33.970 --> 09:35.970
Hey.

09:35.970 --> 09:37.970
Hey, Kevin, what's going on?
What's happening?

09:37.970 --> 09:39.980
How's it goin'?
How's your family? Good?

09:39.980 --> 09:41.980
It's great.
So nice to see you.

09:41.980 --> 09:42.980
Fuck off.

09:42.980 --> 09:43.980
This is business.

09:43.980 --> 09:46.980
There was an accident in Maine.

09:46.980 --> 09:48.990
Some guy got killed
by something in a lake.

09:48.990 --> 09:52.990
Probably a bear,
But they found a tooth.

09:52.990 --> 09:53.990
A tooth?

09:53.990 --> 09:54.990
A fragment of a tooth,

09:54.990 --> 09:58.000
one they say couldn't
have come from any bear.

09:58.000 --> 10:02.000
Evidently it looks prehistoric,
like maybe a dinosaur.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.010
Oh, well, then I'm sure
that that's what it was.

10:04.010 --> 10:06.010
He was killed by a dinosaur.

10:06.010 --> 10:08.010
Is there anything else?

10:08.010 --> 10:09.010
I, uh, want you to go there.

10:09.010 --> 10:11.020
What?

10:11.020 --> 10:14.020
It's probably nothing,
But you're a paleontologist.

10:14.020 --> 10:16.020
This is what we do.

10:16.020 --> 10:17.020
What do you mean,
this is what we do?

10:17.020 --> 10:19.030
I'd like you to
check out this tooth.

10:19.030 --> 10:21.030
I'm not a field person.

10:21.030 --> 10:24.030
Well, on this one,
I would like you to be.

10:24.030 --> 10:28.040
You want me to go to Maine
to look at a tooth?

10:29.040 --> 10:32.040
Oh, this was Myra's
idea, wasn't it?

10:32.040 --> 10:34.040
- Uh--
-Oh, of course.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.050
Get me out of the office
for a few days,

10:35.050 --> 10:36.050
wait till I cool off...

10:36.050 --> 10:38.050
It has nothing to do with that.

10:38.050 --> 10:40.050
I don't do field work,
and even if I did, Maine?

10:40.050 --> 10:42.050
I'm allergic to timber.

10:42.050 --> 10:44.060
- Kelly.
- I am not going to Maine.

10:44.060 --> 10:46.060
I'm not going to Maine.

10:46.060 --> 10:50.060
It's ridiculous.

10:53.070 --> 10:55.070
It's gonna be rough

10:55.070 --> 10:57.070
as we go over these mountains.

10:57.070 --> 10:59.080
Yeah, that's fine.
Thank you.

10:59.080 --> 11:03.080
We're doing the best we can.

11:03.080 --> 11:06.090
Could you not talk to me?

11:06.090 --> 11:10.090
Thank you.

11:16.100 --> 11:18.100
Just came up screaming.

11:18.100 --> 11:19.100
What did he say?

11:19.100 --> 11:22.110
Just kind of gurgled.
He was pretty much dead.

11:22.110 --> 11:24.110
You didn't see anything?

11:24.110 --> 11:26.110
The lake was calm
until up he came.

11:26.110 --> 11:27.110
The tooth is in here.

11:27.110 --> 11:29.120
Oh, that's--
that's the morgue.

11:29.120 --> 11:31.120
Yes.

11:31.120 --> 11:34.120
Well, is the dead guy in there?

11:34.120 --> 11:38.130
That's where they keep them.

11:38.130 --> 11:39.130
Look...

11:39.130 --> 11:41.130
you want me to bring
the tooth out here?

11:41.130 --> 11:42.130
No.

11:42.130 --> 11:44.130
No. Let's...

11:44.130 --> 11:45.130
After you.

11:46.140 --> 11:50.140
This is reptilian.
And this is not a fossil.

11:50.140 --> 11:52.140
You really pulled this
out of this guy?

11:52.140 --> 11:54.150
Yes, I did.

11:54.150 --> 11:57.150
I'll need to get
a microscopic look at it.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.150
There you go.

11:58.150 --> 12:02.160
Great.

12:02.160 --> 12:03.160
Maybe I should see--

12:03.160 --> 12:06.160
I wouldn't.

12:06.160 --> 12:10.170
I can deal with
dead men--bodies.

12:14.170 --> 12:15.170
Ohh.

12:15.170 --> 12:19.180
Uhh. Ohh, jeez.

12:24.180 --> 12:26.190
How long did this attack
go on for?

12:26.190 --> 12:29.190
Seconds.
8 maybe 10.

12:29.190 --> 12:32.190
Oh, and, uh, this is how
he came up to the boat?

12:32.190 --> 12:33.200
Yes.

12:33.200 --> 12:36.200
Uh-huh.

12:36.200 --> 12:40.200
I'd like to see this lake.

12:40.200 --> 12:43.210
Nobody lives
with in 25 miles of it,

12:43.210 --> 12:46.210
except some old couple
who live right on the lake.

12:46.210 --> 12:48.210
Teenagers trek in
every once in a while

12:48.210 --> 12:50.220
to skinny-dip.

12:50.220 --> 12:52.220
None have disappeared.

12:52.220 --> 12:54.220
None have spotted
anything unusual.

12:54.220 --> 12:56.220
Did you talk to the old couple?

12:56.220 --> 12:57.230
Not yet.

12:57.230 --> 12:59.230
What kind of backup do we have?

12:59.230 --> 13:00.230
We?

13:00.230 --> 13:02.230
What?

13:02.230 --> 13:05.240
I'm a little unclear
as to why the museum

13:05.240 --> 13:06.240
would send somebody here.

13:06.240 --> 13:07.240
You got a thing against museums?

13:07.240 --> 13:09.240
No, I got nothing against museums.

13:09.240 --> 13:13.250
Ever been in one?

13:17.250 --> 13:18.250
What is that?

13:18.250 --> 13:20.260
Lightweight forward-area
air-device unit.

13:20.260 --> 13:22.260
Whatever's out there,

13:22.260 --> 13:24.260
one shot with this, it's dead.

13:24.260 --> 13:26.260
Why exactly would you have that?

13:28.270 --> 13:32.270
God.

13:34.270 --> 13:37.280
Mosquitoes. I got a thing
about mosquitoes.

13:37.280 --> 13:38.280
If you're all set, let's go.

13:38.280 --> 13:40.280
We're saved.

13:40.280 --> 13:41.280
A museum in New York

13:41.280 --> 13:44.280
just sent us some
additional backup.

13:44.280 --> 13:46.290
Kelly Scott.

13:46.290 --> 13:48.290
Jack Wells.

13:48.290 --> 13:49.290
Hi.

13:49.290 --> 13:51.290
Uh, some museum sent you, huh?

13:51.290 --> 13:53.300
What, are we all
museum bigots in Maine?

13:53.300 --> 13:54.300
She's rude sarcastic.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.300
You two should get along.

13:56.300 --> 13:58.300
I'm afraid I can't let you
go with us, ma'am.

13:58.300 --> 14:00.310
Sheriff Keough said I could.

14:00.310 --> 14:02.310
Unfortunately, Fish and Game
supersedes the sheriff.

14:02.310 --> 14:04.310
Why do you have to supersede?
Maybe I might be of--

14:04.310 --> 14:05.310
Ma'am, look,

14:05.310 --> 14:07.310
this isn't some kind of
fact-finding expedition.

14:07.310 --> 14:09.320
Yes, I know that.

14:09.320 --> 14:10.320
It's not a science trip.

14:10.320 --> 14:11.320
Could you be
a little more condescending?

14:11.320 --> 14:15.320
'Cause I'm not real great
with subtlety.

14:15.320 --> 14:17.330
Something in that lake
killed somebody, right?

14:17.330 --> 14:19.330
I appreciate
you're trying to help.

14:19.330 --> 14:22.330
I'm really glad that you
brought the raid.

14:22.330 --> 14:23.330
Now, that's better.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.340
Ma'am,
it's not gonna work--

14:24.340 --> 14:26.340
If you call me "ma'am"
one more time, I'll sue you,

14:26.340 --> 14:27.340
and with today's laws,
it's possible.

14:27.340 --> 14:30.340
She's good.

14:30.340 --> 14:32.350
Look, I won't interfere.

14:32.350 --> 14:34.350
And if I do, you've got
a sheriff handy to arrest me,

14:34.350 --> 14:37.350
but I understand if I threaten
your Fish and Game authority--

14:37.350 --> 14:38.350
Excuse me.

14:38.350 --> 14:39.360
Is it true you're going to look

14:39.360 --> 14:41.360
for some kind of monster
in Black Lake?

14:41.360 --> 14:44.360
Well, we're just gonna
investigate an accident.

14:44.360 --> 14:45.360
There's no monster.

14:45.360 --> 14:47.370
We heard a man was bit in half.

14:47.370 --> 14:49.370
Well, there was an accident.

14:49.370 --> 14:53.370
That's all. It's
nothing to worry about.

14:56.380 --> 14:59.380
Oh, please.

14:59.380 --> 15:03.390
All right. Let's go.

15:23.410 --> 15:25.410
Well, my husband passed away.

15:25.410 --> 15:28.420
It's been almost 2 years now.

15:28.420 --> 15:30.420
My department doesn't
have any record of that,

15:30.420 --> 15:32.420
Mrs. Bickerman.

15:32.420 --> 15:33.420
Well, I'm sorry.

15:33.420 --> 15:36.430
Incomplete records haunt me so.

15:36.430 --> 15:38.430
What was the cause
of your husband's death,

15:38.430 --> 15:41.430
ma'am, do you know?

15:41.430 --> 15:43.440
We don't mean
to invade your privacy,

15:43.440 --> 15:45.440
but was he ill?
Was he sick?

15:45.440 --> 15:46.440
Was he swallowed?

15:46.440 --> 15:47.440
Sheriff.

15:47.440 --> 15:49.440
Uh, Mrs. Bickerman,
the reason we're here.

15:49.440 --> 15:51.450
A man was fatally
attacked yesterday

15:51.450 --> 15:54.450
by some animal in this lake.

15:54.450 --> 15:56.450
Do you know how your husband died?

15:56.450 --> 15:57.450
Oh, yes.

15:57.450 --> 16:01.460
I killed him.

16:01.460 --> 16:02.460
You killed him?

16:02.460 --> 16:03.460
Oh, yes.

16:03.460 --> 16:04.460
Uh...

16:04.460 --> 16:08.470
and how would you have
accomplished this, ma'am?

16:08.470 --> 16:09.470
Well...

16:09.470 --> 16:11.470
He was very sick,

16:11.470 --> 16:14.480
and--and he refused
to go to a doctor.

16:14.480 --> 16:17.480
He'd be coherent one day
and incoherent the next.

16:17.480 --> 16:20.480
And, well, one coherent day

16:20.480 --> 16:21.480
he asked me to end his suffering.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.490
And, um...

16:23.490 --> 16:26.490
he kept insisting and insisting

16:26.490 --> 16:29.500
and then, well,
finally I just gave in,

16:29.500 --> 16:31.500
and I hit him on the head
with a skillet,

16:31.500 --> 16:35.500
then buried him
out at the bulkhead.

16:37.500 --> 16:39.510
Well, dig him up
if you don't believe me,

16:39.510 --> 16:43.510
Sherlock.

16:47.520 --> 16:50.520
Half mile up
there's a clearing.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.520
What's with the water?
It's so black.

16:52.520 --> 16:54.530
There's no waves or anything.

16:54.530 --> 16:56.530
Well, they wanted to
call it "Lake Placid, "

16:56.530 --> 17:00.530
but somebody said
that name was taken.

17:00.530 --> 17:03.540
It's too bad.

17:03.540 --> 17:05.540
Tents were sent ahead.

17:05.540 --> 17:06.540
They should already be set up

17:06.540 --> 17:08.540
by the time we get there.

17:08.540 --> 17:09.550
Tents?

17:09.550 --> 17:10.550
We're staying in tents?

17:10.550 --> 17:13.550
I told you, 2 days
we'd have to camp.

17:13.550 --> 17:15.550
Yes, camp,

17:15.550 --> 17:16.550
but I thought that meant
"Ramada Inn."

17:16.550 --> 17:18.560
I never heard tents.
Will there be toilets?

17:18.560 --> 17:20.560
Maybe we should
just take you back.

17:20.560 --> 17:23.560
Why, because I prefer a toilet?

17:23.560 --> 17:24.560
Oh, God.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.569
We forgot to pack
feminine napkins.

17:26.569 --> 17:27.569
Oh, so you're with him now?

17:27.569 --> 17:28.569
Taking his side.

17:28.569 --> 17:30.570
I didn't say a word.

17:30.570 --> 17:32.570
Oh, no, maybe I should
just wipe myself

17:32.570 --> 17:34.580
with some leafy little piece
of poison oak.

17:34.580 --> 17:35.580
And then I could
spend the whole day

17:35.580 --> 17:38.580
scratching my ass,
blending in with the natives.

17:38.580 --> 17:40.580
Then you'd be back on my side.

17:40.580 --> 17:42.590
You know, you really
don't have to bother

17:42.590 --> 17:44.590
telling people
you're from New York.

17:44.590 --> 17:45.590
What the hell is that?

17:45.590 --> 17:46.590
What?

17:46.590 --> 17:50.600
There. I thought
I saw something.

17:50.600 --> 17:53.600
Kelly:
Looks like a branch.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.600
Oh, my God.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.610
Aah!

17:58.610 --> 17:59.610
Hey.

17:59.610 --> 18:01.610
You threw it at me!

18:01.610 --> 18:02.610
I just let go of it.

18:02.610 --> 18:04.620
You threw it at me!

18:04.620 --> 18:05.620
Did you see that?
Oh!

18:05.620 --> 18:06.620
Ma'am!

18:06.620 --> 18:08.620
Stop hitting me.

18:08.620 --> 18:09.620
Don't throw heads at me!

18:09.620 --> 18:11.620
Stop calling me
"ma'am!"

18:11.620 --> 18:13.630
Aw, Jesus.

18:13.630 --> 18:14.630
Oh, God.

18:14.630 --> 18:17.630
So, sheriff...

18:17.630 --> 18:21.640
how many deputies you got?

18:24.640 --> 18:28.650
What?

18:32.650 --> 18:33.650
Could it be a bear?

18:33.650 --> 18:35.650
I mean, the bears
get big here, right?

18:35.650 --> 18:39.660
Hmm. I don't think a bear
could bite off a moose's head.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.660
Everything you need
should be in there.

18:41.660 --> 18:43.660
Ok. Good. Good.

18:43.660 --> 18:44.670
So will we be
tent-mates then?

18:44.670 --> 18:46.670
Nope.
This is all yours.

18:46.670 --> 18:48.670
Ohh. Great.

18:48.670 --> 18:49.670
Excellent.

18:49.670 --> 18:50.670
If there's anything else
you need...

18:50.670 --> 18:52.680
Uh, one thing
I wanted to ask you.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.680
Uh, what's it like to be a woman

18:54.680 --> 18:56.680
in the woods of Maine?

18:56.680 --> 18:58.680
I mean, the guys don't turn
all horny or anything

18:58.680 --> 19:02.690
like they did in
deliverance, right?

19:04.690 --> 19:06.690
Oh.

19:06.690 --> 19:08.700
I knew you were there.

19:08.700 --> 19:10.700
Hmm.

19:10.700 --> 19:12.700
Never been to Maine before, huh?

19:12.700 --> 19:16.710
I have good hygiene.
I'm not welcome.

19:16.710 --> 19:17.710
Why are you here, really?

19:17.710 --> 19:19.710
I told you.

19:19.710 --> 19:21.710
A museum doesn't send an
investigator into the woods--

19:21.710 --> 19:22.710
How would you know

19:22.710 --> 19:23.720
what a museum would
or would not do exactly?

19:23.720 --> 19:25.720
Well, even if they did,

19:25.720 --> 19:28.720
I doubt whether he or she
would have problems with tents.

19:28.720 --> 19:29.720
So I don't like tents.
Why--

19:29.720 --> 19:31.730
Oh, you don't like tents,
and you don't like mosquitoes.

19:31.730 --> 19:32.730
Well, nobody likes
mosquit--

19:32.730 --> 19:33.730
Look at your fingernails.

19:33.730 --> 19:35.730
What's wrong with my fingernails?

19:35.730 --> 19:36.730
You have as much business
being in the woods

19:36.730 --> 19:38.730
as Emily Post.

19:38.730 --> 19:39.740
No, it doesn't make sense.

19:39.740 --> 19:42.740
They sent you out here
to examine a tooth.

19:42.740 --> 19:46.740
And what are you doing
out here on the lake?

19:46.740 --> 19:48.750
Oh, no.

19:48.750 --> 19:51.750
What?

19:51.750 --> 19:55.760
If this is who I think it is...

19:55.760 --> 19:56.760
It is.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.760
Who?

19:58.760 --> 19:59.760
Hector Cyr.

19:59.760 --> 20:03.770
He's this rich, kook
mythology professor.

20:08.770 --> 20:09.770
You know him?

20:09.770 --> 20:11.780
He's done some work
with our museum.

20:11.780 --> 20:14.780
He also treks the world to s...

20:14.780 --> 20:15.780
What?

20:15.780 --> 20:19.790
To swim with crocodiles.

20:21.790 --> 20:23.790
Crocodiles?

20:23.790 --> 20:24.790
If he's here,

20:24.790 --> 20:27.800
he must think you've got one.

20:27.800 --> 20:28.800
Oh, look...

20:28.800 --> 20:30.800
I admit I'm no brain scientist,

20:30.800 --> 20:33.800
but I do know there's
no way a crocodile

20:33.800 --> 20:37.810
can be in Maine, right?

20:38.810 --> 20:40.810
You beat me!

20:40.810 --> 20:42.820
Balls!

20:42.820 --> 20:43.820
Splendid lake, eh?

20:43.820 --> 20:45.820
Became a man on a lake like this.

20:45.820 --> 20:47.820
Rubber raft.

20:47.820 --> 20:49.820
Sylvia Blake.

20:49.820 --> 20:51.830
She gave a like a cow.

20:51.830 --> 20:52.830
Who do we have
from Fish and Game?

20:52.830 --> 20:53.830
Me.

20:53.830 --> 20:54.830
Who is this man?

20:54.830 --> 20:56.830
I can see the algae blooms
Just coming in.

20:56.830 --> 20:58.840
Look almost stagnant.

20:58.840 --> 20:59.840
Hector Cyr.

20:59.840 --> 21:00.840
Oh, the earth is round
and so should you be.

21:00.840 --> 21:02.840
Who is he?

21:02.840 --> 21:04.840
I need topographic studies.
You got any?

21:04.840 --> 21:06.850
You don't just fly in here
and start barking orders.

21:06.850 --> 21:08.850
I apologize. I just don't
want to lose the light

21:08.850 --> 21:10.850
when we got time
for a quick scout.

21:10.850 --> 21:11.850
Have you had a little work done?

21:11.850 --> 21:12.850
I have not.

21:12.850 --> 21:13.850
Who are you?

21:13.850 --> 21:15.860
Hector Cyr.
I said it once.

21:15.860 --> 21:16.860
Let me know when it sinks in, ok?

21:16.860 --> 21:17.860
Have you seen it?

21:17.860 --> 21:18.860
No.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.860
Excuse me.
You came here to...

21:20.860 --> 21:22.870
help you find it.

21:22.870 --> 21:23.870
A crocodile?

21:23.870 --> 21:24.870
Yeah.

21:24.870 --> 21:26.870
They've been migrating north,
you know?

21:26.870 --> 21:27.870
This lake does connect
to the ocean.

21:27.870 --> 21:29.880
It's not as farfetched
as it may sound.

21:29.880 --> 21:31.880
Crocodiles can't swim
in saltwater.

21:31.880 --> 21:34.880
Yeah, well, that'll be
your little secret.

21:34.880 --> 21:37.890
Come on.
We're losing time.

21:37.890 --> 21:38.890
Why did the big one heckle me?

21:38.890 --> 21:42.890
Hey, pal...

22:08.930 --> 22:10.930
If he's close, we'll find him.

22:10.930 --> 22:13.930
Their signatures
are unmistakable.

22:13.930 --> 22:17.940
She tell you
that we had sex together?

22:17.940 --> 22:18.940
So vigorous!

22:18.940 --> 22:20.940
I never had sex with you.

22:20.940 --> 22:24.950
Whew. I'm horrible in bed.
They never remember.

22:24.950 --> 22:25.950
God.

22:25.950 --> 22:26.950
Wait.

22:26.950 --> 22:27.950
Stop!

22:33.960 --> 22:35.960
Thought I heard something.

22:35.960 --> 22:37.960
I don't mean to be discourteous,

22:37.960 --> 22:39.960
but, uh, how is it

22:39.960 --> 22:41.970
a person could come to believe

22:41.970 --> 22:43.970
a crocodile is in New England?

22:43.970 --> 22:45.970
How could it survive winter?

22:45.970 --> 22:47.970
Long as their nostrils
don't freeze,

22:47.970 --> 22:48.980
they survive.

22:48.980 --> 22:50.980
Am I foolish to explain things?

22:50.980 --> 22:51.980
He had such trouble with my name.

22:51.980 --> 22:53.980
- Hector.
- Hey.

22:53.980 --> 22:54.980
Is this where it happened?

22:54.980 --> 22:56.990
Around here.
Yeah.

22:56.990 --> 22:58.990
We're a mile from the ocean.
Could've easily made it here.

22:58.990 --> 22:59.990
Assuming he got
this far up the seaboard.

23:00.990 --> 23:02.990
The big ones
have been on the move.

23:02.990 --> 23:05.000
What have I been telling you?
You call me crazy.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
Kelly:
Hector, just paddle.

23:07.000 --> 23:09.000
You know, Sheriff,

23:09.000 --> 23:11.000
when friends or family say things,

23:11.000 --> 23:12.000
they tend not to register,

23:12.000 --> 23:14.010
so sometimes it helps to hear it

23:14.010 --> 23:15.010
from a total stranger.

23:15.010 --> 23:17.010
You're fat.

23:17.010 --> 23:19.010
Jesus. Hector!

23:19.010 --> 23:20.020
Oh, yeah.

23:20.020 --> 23:23.020
Kelly: What's that?

23:23.020 --> 23:24.020
What is it?

23:24.020 --> 23:27.020
White perch.

23:27.020 --> 23:28.030
Are they feeding?

23:28.030 --> 23:30.030
They aren't feeding.

23:30.030 --> 23:33.030
They're scared.

23:33.030 --> 23:35.030
-Aah!
-Aah!

23:35.030 --> 23:36.030
Jesus!

23:36.030 --> 23:41.040
Oh!

23:43.040 --> 23:45.050
Get your legs out of the water.

23:45.050 --> 23:46.050
Don't move your legs.

23:46.050 --> 23:47.050
Are you kidding me?

23:47.050 --> 23:51.060
Keep your legs still.

23:53.060 --> 23:54.060
Get off.

23:54.060 --> 23:55.060
Hector, to the left.

23:55.060 --> 23:57.060
Move it left!

23:57.060 --> 23:58.060
Paddle, paddle!

23:58.060 --> 24:01.070
No one actually saw anything.

24:01.070 --> 24:03.070
Yes, I realize that, sir,

24:03.070 --> 24:04.070
but something flipped us over,

24:04.070 --> 24:07.080
and I doubt very much
if it was a mink.

24:07.080 --> 24:08.080
I am a paleontologist.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.080
I work for
a natural history museum.

24:10.080 --> 24:11.080
I am not some--

24:11.080 --> 24:13.080
They don't believe her.

24:13.080 --> 24:14.080
Thank you.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.090
It's so rewarding to
imagine my tax dollar

24:16.090 --> 24:18.090
finding its way to you,
you fuck-shit!

24:18.090 --> 24:21.090
You're a saucy flirt.

24:21.090 --> 24:22.090
You were right.

24:22.090 --> 24:24.100
U.S.Wildlife
won't send anybody

24:24.100 --> 24:25.100
without a confirmation.

24:25.100 --> 24:27.100
We don't need 'em.

24:27.100 --> 24:28.100
Sheriff.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.100
Yeah?

24:29.100 --> 24:33.110
Might wanna come
take a look at this.

24:34.110 --> 24:35.110
Oh, my God.

24:35.110 --> 24:36.110
Worms.

24:36.110 --> 24:38.110
Oh, I got a thing about worms.

24:38.110 --> 24:42.120
It's a human toe.

24:43.120 --> 24:46.120
Some decomposition,
a little acidic--

24:46.120 --> 24:50.130
definitely been swallowed.

24:52.130 --> 24:55.140
Is this the man who was killed?

24:55.140 --> 24:57.140
He seemed taller.

24:57.140 --> 24:59.140
Phew.

24:59.140 --> 25:00.140
You got a croc, all right.

25:00.140 --> 25:02.140
They're a keystone species.

25:02.140 --> 25:04.150
Did he just explain something?

25:04.150 --> 25:07.150
Keystone species effects
the whole ecosystem.

25:07.150 --> 25:09.150
That would explain these worms

25:09.150 --> 25:12.160
and those perch.

25:12.160 --> 25:15.160
We got a crocodile.

25:15.160 --> 25:19.170
Here's your friend.

25:34.190 --> 25:36.190
Tom Jones:
It's not unusual.

25:36.190 --> 25:38.190
To be loved by anyone

25:40.190 --> 25:41.200
It's not unusual.

25:41.200 --> 25:45.200
To have fun with anyone.

25:45.200 --> 25:47.200
But when I see you hangin' around

25:47.200 --> 25:50.210
With anyone.

25:50.210 --> 25:51.210
It's not unusual...

25:51.210 --> 25:52.210
He paid us.

25:52.210 --> 25:54.210
500.

25:54.210 --> 25:55.210
It's a trap.

25:55.210 --> 25:59.220
You accepted money from him?

25:59.220 --> 26:03.220
We took a check.

26:03.220 --> 26:06.230
When I see you out and about.

26:06.230 --> 26:08.230
Law enforcement
is very dangerous work,

26:08.230 --> 26:09.230
isn't it?

26:09.230 --> 26:12.230
And you have such
big, wonderful boobs.

26:12.230 --> 26:14.240
Ha ha. Thank you.

26:14.240 --> 26:15.240
It's not unusual.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.240
It happens every day.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.240
Hey!

26:18.240 --> 26:21.250
- Hey!
- Hey!
- Hey!

26:21.250 --> 26:22.250
You're on official business.

26:22.250 --> 26:24.250
This is not a party.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.250
Yeah, but now that you're here...

26:26.250 --> 26:27.250
Whoo!

26:27.250 --> 26:28.250
Yeah!

26:28.250 --> 26:29.260
Quiet!

26:32.260 --> 26:34.260
What's with digging the holes?

26:34.260 --> 26:36.260
Well, crocodiles are--

26:36.260 --> 26:38.270
are very brazen.

26:38.270 --> 26:40.270
They like to come on land,

26:40.270 --> 26:42.270
and of course
they're attracted to noise.

26:42.270 --> 26:44.270
Everybody out!
Back to your tents!

26:44.270 --> 26:45.280
Now!

26:45.280 --> 26:47.280
Oh, could she stay?

26:47.280 --> 26:48.280
We were...

26:48.280 --> 26:49.280
we were hoping to mate.

26:49.280 --> 26:51.280
No.

26:51.280 --> 26:55.290
Out.

26:55.290 --> 26:56.290
Now, you listen...

26:57.290 --> 26:59.290
If it were up to me,
you'd be on your way home.

26:59.290 --> 27:00.300
But I'm not in charge.

27:00.300 --> 27:02.300
That's a shocker there.

27:02.300 --> 27:04.300
I'm going to say this

27:04.300 --> 27:07.300
because I believe in being
straight with people.

27:07.300 --> 27:10.310
I think you are a mental.

27:10.310 --> 27:13.310
Sheriff...

27:13.310 --> 27:15.310
I appreciate your candor.
Really, I do.

27:15.310 --> 27:17.320
I think it's always good to know

27:17.320 --> 27:19.320
where somebody's coming from,

27:19.320 --> 27:20.320
and, frankly,

27:20.320 --> 27:24.320
your origins have been
a bit of a mystery to me.

27:42.350 --> 27:45.350
Look how flat that water is.

27:45.350 --> 27:48.360
You could get 10 skips
on a good one, easy.

27:48.360 --> 27:49.360
Sorry?

27:49.360 --> 27:53.360
Skipping stones.

27:53.360 --> 27:54.360
Growing up,

27:54.360 --> 27:56.370
I used to summer
At my grandparents' place

27:56.370 --> 27:58.370
on a lake like this.

27:58.370 --> 28:01.370
I'd skip stones all day.

28:01.370 --> 28:03.370
Beat playing with the other kids.

28:03.370 --> 28:07.380
I'm sure it did.

28:07.380 --> 28:10.380
Look, I think it's best

28:10.380 --> 28:12.390
if you stayed onshore a while.

28:12.390 --> 28:13.390
I beg your pardon?

28:13.390 --> 28:15.390
I'm not trying to pick a fight,

28:15.390 --> 28:17.390
but whatever's out there
did flip a canoe.

28:17.390 --> 28:19.400
I am not staying onshore.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.400
It's dangerous.

28:21.400 --> 28:23.400
No, I didn't fly up here
Just to roast marshmallows.

28:23.400 --> 28:25.400
Why did you fly up here?

28:25.400 --> 28:26.400
Look...

28:26.400 --> 28:28.410
palaeontologists are not
sent to Maine

28:28.410 --> 28:29.410
to hunt for crocodiles.

28:29.410 --> 28:31.410
I was sent up here
to look at the tooth.

28:31.410 --> 28:33.410
You looked at the tooth.

28:33.410 --> 28:37.420
What are you doing out here?

28:39.420 --> 28:41.420
I was dating my boss...

28:41.420 --> 28:45.430
and he turned out to be
involved with a co worker

28:45.430 --> 28:47.430
who was also my friend.

28:47.430 --> 28:49.430
And for the sake
of comfort--theirs--

28:49.430 --> 28:51.440
I was shipped off to Maine.

28:51.440 --> 28:55.440
And I don't feel
like going back yet.

28:57.440 --> 29:00.450
I'm not making it up.

29:00.450 --> 29:01.450
Still, you don't
have to stay out here.

29:01.450 --> 29:03.450
I mean, you can stay in town.

29:03.450 --> 29:05.450
I've come. I'm here.
I'm staying...

29:05.450 --> 29:06.460
unless there are ticks.

29:06.460 --> 29:08.460
I know crocodiles.

29:08.460 --> 29:10.460
And I won't get in your way.

29:10.460 --> 29:14.470
I just really do want
to be a part of this.

29:18.470 --> 29:20.470
7:00 A.M.?

29:20.470 --> 29:24.480
Thank you.

29:30.490 --> 29:32.490
Good night.

29:32.490 --> 29:36.490
Thank you.

31:14.620 --> 31:16.620
Jesus fucking Christ!

31:16.620 --> 31:18.620
Ohh. What the hell
are you doing?

31:18.620 --> 31:19.620
What the hell are you doing?!

31:19.620 --> 31:20.620
Oh, Jesus.
You clowning around?

31:20.620 --> 31:21.630
I'm laying a spring trap!

31:21.630 --> 31:22.630
A spring trap?

31:22.630 --> 31:24.630
I keep telling you
they can come on land.

31:24.630 --> 31:26.630
I could've shot you.

31:26.630 --> 31:28.630
This could end up
saving your life,

31:28.630 --> 31:29.640
which is meaningful for you,

31:29.640 --> 31:31.640
because the more you live,

31:31.640 --> 31:33.640
the more sex you get to
have with your sister!

31:33.640 --> 31:34.640
What's going on?

31:34.640 --> 31:36.650
He's crawling around
like a cockroach here.

31:36.650 --> 31:37.650
I don't care
how much money--

31:37.650 --> 31:39.650
He's waving
his little wang around!

31:39.650 --> 31:40.650
He's scaring the shit out of me!

31:40.650 --> 31:41.650
How big is this?

31:41.650 --> 31:42.650
All right, all right!

31:42.650 --> 31:44.650
I'll say this once.

31:44.650 --> 31:45.660
Your fancy equipment aside,

31:45.660 --> 31:47.660
which we appreciate--

31:47.660 --> 31:50.660
if you interfere, you're gone.

31:50.660 --> 31:54.670
Simple as that.

31:57.670 --> 32:00.680
How much of a wacko is this guy?

32:00.680 --> 32:02.680
Well...

32:02.680 --> 32:04.680
the thing about Hector

32:04.680 --> 32:06.680
is he takes this
crocodile business very...

32:06.680 --> 32:08.690
Oh, man.

32:08.690 --> 32:10.690
He thinks they're godly.

32:10.690 --> 32:12.690
What was that?

32:12.690 --> 32:13.690
In his defense,

32:13.690 --> 32:15.690
every primitive culture
known to man deified them.

32:15.690 --> 32:18.700
Ancient China, Egypt,
Australia, Asia.

32:18.700 --> 32:20.700
Going back in history,

32:20.700 --> 32:22.700
crocodiles have been
more worshiped than Jesus.

32:22.700 --> 32:24.710
Is this supposed to make us

32:24.710 --> 32:25.710
take him more seriously?

32:25.710 --> 32:27.710
No, it's supposed to make you
understand him.

32:27.710 --> 32:29.710
He's a mythology professor.

32:29.710 --> 32:31.710
He believes
that they're divine conduits.

32:31.710 --> 32:33.720
And he can find them,

32:33.720 --> 32:34.720
so we should try
to put up with him.

32:34.720 --> 32:37.720
He's a fruitcake.

32:37.720 --> 32:39.730
We should get some sleep.

32:39.730 --> 32:40.730
Yeah.

32:40.730 --> 32:41.730
Aah!

32:41.730 --> 32:42.730
Damn it!

32:42.730 --> 32:46.730
And he's a good trapper.

33:07.760 --> 33:09.760
We can expect a quick response

33:09.760 --> 33:10.760
if he hears that.

33:10.760 --> 33:14.770
Adult crocs will move
on distressed hatchlings.

33:14.770 --> 33:15.770
Again, I don't mean to be annoying

33:15.770 --> 33:17.770
with my questions

33:17.770 --> 33:18.770
but if it is a crocodile,

33:18.770 --> 33:20.780
which I don't think it is,

33:20.780 --> 33:23.780
and they do charge these
baby hatchling sounds,

33:23.780 --> 33:26.790
why would you want to be
underwater at the time?

33:26.790 --> 33:28.790
With you, it makes sense.

33:28.790 --> 33:29.790
You see, Sheriff, the thing is,

33:29.790 --> 33:30.790
they don't really
attack underwater.

33:30.790 --> 33:32.790
That Walt guy got hit underwater.

33:32.790 --> 33:34.790
True. They don't see
that well underwater.

33:34.790 --> 33:36.800
They have nictitating
lenses on their eyes...

33:36.800 --> 33:38.800
Burke, stop here.

33:38.800 --> 33:39.800
- Now?
-Yeah.

33:39.800 --> 33:41.800
...You dive underwater

33:41.800 --> 33:42.800
and they probably won't
be able to see you.

33:42.800 --> 33:44.810
I hate to interrupt
but we got work to do.

33:44.810 --> 33:46.810
Hey, we can talk if we want.

33:46.810 --> 33:48.810
Yeah, we can talk if we want.

33:48.810 --> 33:52.820
Would you mind putting down
the anchor?

33:53.820 --> 33:55.820
Wait till we're down there

33:55.820 --> 33:57.820
before you turn that thing on.

33:57.820 --> 33:59.830
Got it.

33:59.830 --> 34:02.830
Let's go, Hector.

34:02.830 --> 34:06.840
Good luck.

34:13.840 --> 34:16.850
I brought a pork chop for luck.

34:16.850 --> 34:18.850
Maybe you can hang it
around you neck.

34:18.850 --> 34:20.850
That's sweet.

34:20.850 --> 34:22.860
Maybe later you can chew the bark

34:22.860 --> 34:26.860
off my big, fat log.

34:29.860 --> 34:33.870
Was that, like,
a homosexual remark?

34:35.870 --> 34:39.880
Don't ask me.

35:27.940 --> 35:29.940
Could be a mental.

35:29.940 --> 35:31.940
I heard if a mental person
is rich enough,

35:31.940 --> 35:32.940
they just call him eccentric.

35:32.940 --> 35:34.950
He's not mental.

35:34.950 --> 35:36.950
He's seen every crocodile
in the world.

35:36.950 --> 35:38.950
He even swam in the Grametti
with killer Niles.

35:38.950 --> 35:40.950
He never got nipped.

35:40.950 --> 35:42.960
And that's why he thinks
they're godly--

35:42.960 --> 35:43.960
'Cause they don't bite him?

35:43.960 --> 35:45.960
I don't know.

35:45.960 --> 35:47.960
He said he knew it when
he looked in their eyes.

35:47.960 --> 35:51.970
"Eyes of a Dragon."

36:55.050 --> 36:59.050
So much for crocodiles.

37:04.060 --> 37:05.060
It's probably on land.

37:05.060 --> 37:09.070
Yeah, right.

37:10.070 --> 37:11.070
What was that?

37:11.070 --> 37:14.070
I don't know.

37:14.070 --> 37:16.080
Aah!

37:16.080 --> 37:17.080
Shit.

37:17.080 --> 37:20.080
Hey! Something's got
the anchor line!

37:20.080 --> 37:22.080
Untie it!
Untie the line!

37:22.080 --> 37:23.080
I'm trying!

37:23.080 --> 37:24.080
Hurry!

37:24.080 --> 37:25.090
Cut the line!

37:25.090 --> 37:27.090
Right!

37:27.090 --> 37:29.090
Shit!

37:31.090 --> 37:32.100
Come on.

37:32.100 --> 37:33.100
What happened?

37:33.100 --> 37:35.100
I don't know.

37:37.100 --> 37:38.100
Hurry. Hurry up.

37:40.110 --> 37:44.110
Must've just let go.

37:45.110 --> 37:48.120
Come on.

37:48.120 --> 37:50.120
Shit! Hurry!

37:50.120 --> 37:53.120
Hank!

37:55.120 --> 37:59.130
Ok!

38:05.140 --> 38:09.140
Oh!

38:11.140 --> 38:15.150
Hurry!

38:17.150 --> 38:18.150
Hurry.

38:18.150 --> 38:22.160
My God, it's right under you!

38:25.160 --> 38:27.170
Aah! Oh, Christ.

38:27.170 --> 38:28.170
Come on, get in the boat.

38:28.170 --> 38:30.170
You all right?

38:30.170 --> 38:31.170
Yeah.

38:31.170 --> 38:33.170
Where's Hector?

38:34.170 --> 38:35.170
I lost track.

38:35.170 --> 38:39.180
We went different directions.

38:44.190 --> 38:48.190
There's some bubbles over there.

38:57.200 --> 38:58.200
Pull it up.

38:58.200 --> 39:02.210
All right. Come on.
Bring him aboard.

39:02.210 --> 39:03.210
What's happened?

39:03.210 --> 39:04.210
Come on.

39:04.210 --> 39:06.210
You see it?
How big is it?

39:06.210 --> 39:08.220
Shut up and get on board.

39:08.220 --> 39:10.220
We lost track of it.
Burke, pull up the speaker!

39:10.220 --> 39:14.220
Are you all right?

39:25.240 --> 39:26.240
-Grab him!
-Aah!

39:26.240 --> 39:30.240
Pull him in!

39:30.240 --> 39:33.250
Aah! Aah!

39:33.250 --> 39:34.250
That it?

39:34.250 --> 39:37.250
Yeah.

39:37.250 --> 39:39.260
Nobody actually saw it.
It happened suddenly.

39:39.260 --> 39:42.260
Didn't get caught in the outboard?

39:42.260 --> 39:46.270
It wasn't the outboard.

39:52.270 --> 39:56.280
Tell them to get here fast, huh?

39:58.280 --> 40:01.280
You ok?

40:01.280 --> 40:04.290
Kelly?

40:04.290 --> 40:07.290
Yeah.

40:07.290 --> 40:09.290
Nobody saw anything.

40:09.290 --> 40:12.300
No.

40:12.300 --> 40:14.300
U.S.Wildlife's
on their way.

40:14.300 --> 40:16.300
The police want to keep
everything quiet

40:16.300 --> 40:19.310
so the press doesn't
get wind of anything.

40:19.310 --> 40:22.310
Everybody just wants us to...

40:22.310 --> 40:26.320
"Sit tight"

40:30.320 --> 40:34.330
Are you...ok?

40:34.330 --> 40:35.330
Well...

40:35.330 --> 40:39.330
you know...

40:39.330 --> 40:43.340
Yeah.

40:45.340 --> 40:48.350
Well, Sheriff, I'm, uh...

40:48.350 --> 40:52.350
Very sorry about your deputy.

40:52.350 --> 40:55.350
He was a good man?

40:55.350 --> 40:59.360
Yep.

40:59.360 --> 41:01.360
Whenever somebody dies, I...

41:01.360 --> 41:03.360
I always think
that it's such a waste

41:03.360 --> 41:06.370
that I didn't know them
any better.

41:06.370 --> 41:10.370
Sorry for your loss, Hector.

41:10.370 --> 41:14.380
Not really what I meant.

41:16.380 --> 41:18.380
Head was just...

41:18.380 --> 41:22.390
bitten off.

41:22.390 --> 41:24.390
You know, I used to have
a recurring nightmare

41:24.390 --> 41:26.390
that I was headless.

41:26.390 --> 41:27.390
I'd be down on the ground

41:27.390 --> 41:29.400
looking up at my body, no head,

41:29.400 --> 41:32.400
just walking around
bumping into everything.

41:32.400 --> 41:34.400
And my parents...

41:34.400 --> 41:36.410
wouldn't let me in the house.

41:36.410 --> 41:38.410
Because they just bought
all these antique lamps,

41:38.410 --> 41:39.410
and they didn't want me
to knock them over,

41:39.410 --> 41:40.410
the fuckers.

41:40.410 --> 41:43.410
Then the neighborhood bullies,

41:43.410 --> 41:44.420
they'd see my round
head on the ground

41:44.420 --> 41:46.420
looking like a ball,

41:46.420 --> 41:47.420
and they'd come over,

41:47.420 --> 41:49.420
and they'd start a soccer game.

41:49.420 --> 41:50.420
And as I was being kicked around,

41:50.420 --> 41:52.430
I'd actually just feel grateful

41:52.430 --> 41:56.430
for being allowed in the game.

41:57.430 --> 41:59.440
What are--
What are your thoughts?

41:59.440 --> 42:02.440
You know, Hector...

42:02.440 --> 42:04.440
I'm sure you're a fine person

42:04.440 --> 42:07.450
in your own mental way,

42:07.450 --> 42:08.450
but I think it would be best

42:08.450 --> 42:12.450
if you and I didn't speak.

42:14.450 --> 42:16.460
Yaaah!

42:16.460 --> 42:19.460
When is U.S.Wildlife
getting here?

42:19.460 --> 42:23.460
I'm still waiting
to confirm if they...

42:24.470 --> 42:27.470
Oh, Jesus.

42:27.470 --> 42:29.470
I--I could probably
cut him down,

42:29.470 --> 42:32.480
but there's this
odd look of mayhem

42:32.480 --> 42:35.480
on his
upside-down face.

42:35.480 --> 42:36.480
Hank.

42:36.480 --> 42:37.480
Yes?

42:37.480 --> 42:39.490
Are you all right?

42:39.490 --> 42:42.490
Could you cut me down?

42:42.490 --> 42:43.490
Do you promise

42:43.490 --> 42:44.490
that you won't attempt
to injure me?

42:44.490 --> 42:47.500
I have no interest in ever
looking at you, Hector.

42:47.500 --> 42:50.500
Ok.

42:50.500 --> 42:52.500
Just, uh, pull him down.

42:52.500 --> 42:56.510
It's a counterweight.

42:56.510 --> 42:57.510
Here. I'll get the knife.

42:57.510 --> 42:59.510
If I'd remembered it was there,

42:59.510 --> 43:02.510
I never would've let
you walk that way.

43:03.520 --> 43:04.520
All right. It's over.

43:04.520 --> 43:05.520
It's over. Remember?

43:05.520 --> 43:07.520
You promised
not to hurt him, so...

43:07.520 --> 43:09.520
I lied.

43:09.520 --> 43:10.520
Wait. Hey! Hey!

43:10.520 --> 43:12.530
Come on! Hold up!

43:12.530 --> 43:13.530
Nowhere to go, my friend.

43:13.530 --> 43:16.530
Now, just--come on!
Knock it off.

43:16.530 --> 43:17.530
Knock it off.
Put that down.

43:17.530 --> 43:18.530
Just settle...

43:20.540 --> 43:23.540
Jesus! Look out!

43:23.540 --> 43:26.550
Whoa!

43:34.560 --> 43:38.560
Aw, shit!

43:55.580 --> 43:57.590
Ok.

43:57.590 --> 43:59.590
I admit it.

43:59.590 --> 44:02.590
It's a crocodile.

44:02.590 --> 44:04.590
Kelly: He's an Indo-Pacific.

44:04.590 --> 44:07.600
Scales were oval.
He's an Asian crocodile.

44:07.600 --> 44:10.600
Why would he come here?
It's impossible.

44:10.600 --> 44:12.600
Asia.
How would he get here?

44:12.600 --> 44:14.610
Obviously some
asshole in Hong Kong

44:14.610 --> 44:15.610
flushed him down the toilet.

44:15.610 --> 44:17.610
He was 30 feet, right?
Had to be.

44:17.610 --> 44:20.610
Well, now maybe somebody's
happy I brought my big gun.

44:20.610 --> 44:22.620
Oh you're gonna
blow him away now?

44:22.620 --> 44:23.620
I should think so.

44:23.620 --> 44:24.620
With your cannon?

44:24.620 --> 44:25.620
Right.
What, I shouldn't?

44:25.620 --> 44:26.620
Well, he's a miracle of nature,

44:26.620 --> 44:28.620
but I know he's very scary.

44:28.620 --> 44:30.630
You're the miracle of nature.

44:30.630 --> 44:32.630
Guys, guys, easy.

44:32.630 --> 44:34.630
We're not gonna do
anything tonight.

44:34.630 --> 44:37.640
I never heard of a crocodile
crossing an ocean.

44:37.640 --> 44:39.640
Well, they conceal information

44:39.640 --> 44:40.640
like that in books.

44:40.640 --> 44:41.640
All right, pal!

44:41.640 --> 44:42.640
Hey, hey, hey.

44:42.640 --> 44:45.650
No, no.
Let him go.

44:45.650 --> 44:46.650
I'm sick of him, too.

44:46.650 --> 44:47.650
I do need to warn you, Sheriff.

44:47.650 --> 44:49.650
The thing about being rich,

44:49.650 --> 44:50.650
my parents did have
the added luxury

44:50.650 --> 44:51.650
of ditching me off
at karate school

44:51.650 --> 44:53.660
on a regular basis,
so I am a brown belt.

44:53.660 --> 44:56.660
Go ahead.
Take your best shot.

44:56.660 --> 44:57.660
Ohh!

44:57.660 --> 44:58.660
Hank!

44:58.660 --> 45:00.660
He said he knew karate.

45:00.660 --> 45:01.670
You hit him.

45:01.670 --> 45:02.670
I did, yeah.

45:02.670 --> 45:04.670
Here.

45:04.670 --> 45:06.670
Did he say "go"?

45:06.670 --> 45:09.680
Aren't you supposed
to say "go" in karate?

45:09.680 --> 45:10.680
You're supposed
to say "go."

45:10.680 --> 45:13.680
Hank, just keep your
distance from him.

45:13.680 --> 45:16.690
Go to your tent.
Cool down.

45:16.690 --> 45:18.690
He doesn't answer my questions?

45:18.690 --> 45:20.690
Why don't you answer my questions?

45:20.690 --> 45:21.690
I fall into a hole.

45:21.690 --> 45:23.690
I go up in a tree.

45:23.690 --> 45:24.700
I swear to God,
I'll say "go."

45:24.700 --> 45:25.700
You bow,
and then you say "go."

45:25.700 --> 45:26.700
As in
"go fuck yourself."

45:26.700 --> 45:29.700
Jesus. They're just
like children.

45:29.700 --> 45:30.700
Yeah.

45:30.700 --> 45:32.700
Oh, my God.

45:32.700 --> 45:34.710
Are you all right?

45:34.710 --> 45:36.710
Yeah, I'm all right.

45:36.710 --> 45:37.710
I've got something for that.

45:37.710 --> 45:38.710
I can fix that.

45:38.710 --> 45:39.710
Yeah?

45:39.710 --> 45:40.720
Yeah.

45:40.720 --> 45:41.720
Ohh!

45:41.720 --> 45:44.720
I just gotta pull it
a little tighter.

45:44.720 --> 45:46.720
There we go.

45:46.720 --> 45:48.730
Who taught you to be a nurse?

45:48.730 --> 45:49.730
Father's a surgeon.

45:49.730 --> 45:51.730
I can even stitch in a pinch,

45:51.730 --> 45:53.730
which probably wouldn't
be such a bad idea.

45:53.730 --> 45:55.730
Uh, no, thanks.

45:55.730 --> 45:57.740
Ok.

45:57.740 --> 46:00.740
You should have seen
the look on your face

46:00.740 --> 46:03.740
when that croc jumped out.

46:03.740 --> 46:04.750
Uh-huh.

46:04.750 --> 46:06.750
You see the look on the bear?

46:06.750 --> 46:10.750
That was the look.

46:10.750 --> 46:12.760
I don't know.

46:12.760 --> 46:14.760
The laws of nature
could be changing, Jack.

46:14.760 --> 46:15.760
That thing out there,
that's--

46:15.760 --> 46:19.760
You're having the best time
of your life, aren't you?

46:19.760 --> 46:21.770
What?

46:21.770 --> 46:22.770
What? People
have been killed.

46:22.770 --> 46:25.770
I hardly think I'm
having a good time.

46:25.770 --> 46:29.780
Why would you--

46:29.780 --> 46:33.780
Does it show?

46:35.790 --> 46:39.790
This is the first time
I've ever actually...

46:39.790 --> 46:42.790
you know, been in
the middle of anything.

46:42.790 --> 46:43.790
Is that why you're here,

46:43.790 --> 46:47.800
to get in the middle
of something?

46:49.800 --> 46:52.810
Maybe.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.810
I've always read
about what's happened.

46:54.810 --> 46:58.810
I've never...

47:01.820 --> 47:04.820
We should go to bed.

47:04.820 --> 47:07.830
I mean we should go to, uh...

47:07.830 --> 47:08.830
rest.

47:08.830 --> 47:11.830
We should go to our
separate tents,

47:11.830 --> 47:14.830
and--here--
get some--go.

47:14.830 --> 47:18.840
I got it.

47:21.840 --> 47:25.850
Thanks for the bandage.

47:25.850 --> 47:27.850
Night.

47:27.850 --> 47:31.860
Yeah.

47:40.870 --> 47:44.870
It doesn't even see him.

47:45.870 --> 47:49.880
There, he got it.

47:49.880 --> 47:51.880
He has one natural enemy.

47:51.880 --> 47:54.890
Only one.

47:54.890 --> 47:55.890
Man?

47:55.890 --> 47:58.890
Man.

47:58.890 --> 47:59.890
So you're the big expert.

47:59.890 --> 48:02.900
You think ours is some
kind of mutant or---

48:02.900 --> 48:05.900
Not necessarily.
There's a 30-footer in India.

48:05.900 --> 48:08.900
Biggest one ever killed
on record was 27 feet.

48:08.900 --> 48:11.910
So why is he here?

48:11.910 --> 48:15.910
Honestly...

48:17.910 --> 48:21.920
I don't know.

48:41.940 --> 48:43.950
Keep your eyes peeled.

48:43.950 --> 48:46.950
You know how fast
these things can be.

48:46.950 --> 48:48.950
I've got ticks, I know it.

48:48.950 --> 48:49.960
They're just so drawn to me.

48:49.960 --> 48:51.960
I got a thing about ticks.

48:51.960 --> 48:54.960
Crawling up your pant leg.

48:54.960 --> 48:56.960
Putt heir heads under your skin.

48:56.960 --> 48:58.970
Look.

48:58.970 --> 48:59.970
What?

48:59.970 --> 49:03.970
Jack.

49:08.980 --> 49:12.980
That's a pretty big print.

49:19.990 --> 49:20.990
Seems like
we're getting lower.

49:20.990 --> 49:23.000
That's what happens when I land.

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Why are we landing?

49:25.000 --> 49:29.000
Because this is the cove
that he obviously lives in.

49:29.000 --> 49:32.010
So why are we landing?

49:32.010 --> 49:36.010
Hector!

49:42.020 --> 49:43.020
We can lift it?

49:43.020 --> 49:45.030
Maybe.

49:45.030 --> 49:46.030
Don't want to mush it there.

49:46.030 --> 49:48.030
I'm not mushing it.

49:48.030 --> 49:51.030
You might mush it.
It's a little soft.

49:51.030 --> 49:55.040
For Christ's sake,
I'm not mushing it!

49:56.040 --> 50:01.040
Aah!

50:01.040 --> 50:03.050
Oh, God.

50:03.050 --> 50:05.050
Ok.

50:05.050 --> 50:07.050
That is it!
That is it!

50:07.050 --> 50:10.060
No, no, I keep
getting hit with heads!

50:10.060 --> 50:11.060
Try to calm down.

50:11.060 --> 50:12.060
You calm down!

50:12.060 --> 50:15.060
Calm down, ok?
Just keep breathing.

50:15.060 --> 50:18.070
I'm being very calm!
I am composed!

50:18.070 --> 50:19.070
This is the second time.

50:19.070 --> 50:20.070
I've been hit
with a severed head,

50:20.070 --> 50:23.070
and it upsets me!

50:23.070 --> 50:27.080
What the hell?

50:29.080 --> 50:32.080
Aah!

50:32.080 --> 50:33.090
I...

50:33.090 --> 50:36.090
I just want to go back
to my tent now.

50:36.090 --> 50:39.090
Can we please go back?

50:39.090 --> 50:41.100
You gotta be kidding.

50:41.100 --> 50:44.100
I'm not kidding!

50:44.100 --> 50:45.100
Look.

50:45.100 --> 50:46.100
The itsy-bitsy spider.

50:46.100 --> 50:48.100
Crawled up the water spout.

50:48.100 --> 50:50.110
Down comes the rain.

50:50.110 --> 50:54.110
To wash the spider out.

50:57.120 --> 50:59.120
Kelly: What is she doing?

50:59.120 --> 51:02.120
Dum de dum de dum.

51:02.120 --> 51:03.120
Kelly: Oh.

51:03.120 --> 51:05.130
What?

51:05.130 --> 51:09.130
Look 10 feet into the water.

51:17.140 --> 51:19.140
Come and get it!

51:28.160 --> 51:31.160
Wow.

51:31.160 --> 51:33.160
Disgusting.

51:33.160 --> 51:35.170
I haven't broken any laws.

51:35.170 --> 51:36.170
Oh, but you have, ma'am.

51:36.170 --> 51:37.170
You lied to us.

51:37.170 --> 51:39.170
That can be
obstruction of justice.

51:39.170 --> 51:40.170
A man has been killed,

51:40.170 --> 51:42.170
in part because of your silence.

51:42.170 --> 51:43.170
I could make out a charge

51:43.170 --> 51:44.180
of reckless endangerment.

51:44.180 --> 51:45.180
And I'm sure PETA
would be annoyed

51:45.180 --> 51:48.180
at how you treat your cows.

51:48.180 --> 51:50.180
The reason I lied,
if I told you the truth,

51:50.180 --> 51:51.180
you'd hunt it down and kill it,

51:51.180 --> 51:53.190
which seems to be exactly
what you're trying to do.

51:53.190 --> 51:55.190
How long have you
been feeding this thing?

51:55.190 --> 51:57.190
6 years.

51:57.190 --> 51:59.190
6 years?

51:59.190 --> 52:02.200
Well, Bernie was out fishing,

52:02.200 --> 52:04.200
and it followed him home.

52:04.200 --> 52:06.200
So we threw it some scraps,

52:06.200 --> 52:08.210
and, well, he didn't
seem to bother anybody.

52:08.210 --> 52:11.210
He became kind of like a pet
who lives in the wild.

52:11.210 --> 52:12.210
He just appeared?

52:12.210 --> 52:14.210
You have no idea
how he arrived here?

52:14.210 --> 52:16.220
No. Do you?

52:16.220 --> 52:18.220
Your husband Bernie,

52:18.220 --> 52:19.220
you didn't, by any chance,

52:19.220 --> 52:21.220
lead him to the lake blindfolded?

52:21.220 --> 52:22.220
If I had a dick,

52:22.220 --> 52:25.230
this is where I'd
tell you to suck it.

52:25.230 --> 52:27.230
Did the crocodile
kill your husband?

52:27.230 --> 52:30.230
Yes, but it was all...

52:30.230 --> 52:31.240
it was a mistake.

52:31.240 --> 52:33.240
A mistake?

52:33.240 --> 52:36.240
One of our horses
got loose 2 years ago.

52:36.240 --> 52:38.240
Went to the lake to drink,

52:38.240 --> 52:40.250
and the crocodile
started coming in,

52:40.250 --> 52:42.250
and Bernie went
to intercede, and--

52:42.250 --> 52:44.250
if I'd reported it,

52:44.250 --> 52:47.260
they'd have sent people
to kill it.

52:47.260 --> 52:49.260
Ma'am, how could you
not report this?

52:49.260 --> 52:50.260
It puts human life at risk.

52:50.260 --> 52:52.260
Nobody lives on this lake.

52:52.260 --> 52:56.270
It's really his lake now.

52:57.270 --> 52:59.270
Come on, Hector.
I know you're crazy,

52:59.270 --> 53:00.270
but you can't do this.

53:00.270 --> 53:02.270
I need to see his habitat
up close, Deputy Gare.

53:02.270 --> 53:04.280
Then watch Nova, ok?

53:04.280 --> 53:07.280
But don't go in the water.

53:07.280 --> 53:08.280
Please.

53:08.280 --> 53:10.280
I'll have sex with you.

53:10.280 --> 53:11.290
Let's just get out of here.

53:11.290 --> 53:12.290
Darling,

53:12.290 --> 53:16.290
he's not gonna hurt me.

53:16.290 --> 53:20.300
Don't.

53:26.310 --> 53:30.310
Hector!

53:31.310 --> 53:33.310
Murders and rapes in the cities.

53:33.310 --> 53:35.320
People bomb planes.

53:35.320 --> 53:37.320
Can the police stop them?
No.

53:37.320 --> 53:39.320
But feed one little cow
to a crocodile--

53:39.320 --> 53:41.320
You stay right here
until the police show.

53:41.320 --> 53:43.330
You're under full house arrest.

53:43.330 --> 53:44.330
Thank you...

53:44.330 --> 53:46.330
Officer Fuckmeat.

53:46.330 --> 53:48.330
Sheriff,
we got a problem with Hector.

53:48.330 --> 53:50.340
What problem?

53:50.340 --> 53:54.340
He went swimming.

53:54.340 --> 53:58.350
Check.

55:06.430 --> 55:08.430
Oh, my.

55:13.440 --> 55:17.450
Suddenly I feel
a bit foolish here.

55:17.450 --> 55:21.450
You're different from the others.

55:22.450 --> 55:26.460
Holy Spirit of Sobek.

55:26.460 --> 55:27.460
Holy Ghost.

55:27.460 --> 55:30.460
Holy shit.

55:30.460 --> 55:32.460
Hector!

55:32.460 --> 55:35.470
Just turn the ignition.

55:35.470 --> 55:39.470
It's fuel injected.

55:41.480 --> 55:43.480
Come on!

55:45.480 --> 55:47.480
I know that under
the circumstances,

55:47.480 --> 55:48.490
biting my head off

55:48.490 --> 55:50.490
might seem viable.

55:50.490 --> 55:54.490
It would cheapen you.

55:56.500 --> 55:58.500
I may get a shot!

55:58.500 --> 55:59.500
No!

55:59.500 --> 56:01.500
Bullets might not
penetrate its hide.

56:01.500 --> 56:03.500
Oh, Jesus. All right,
just a little further.

56:03.500 --> 56:05.510
Just like that.

56:20.530 --> 56:24.530
Move over!

56:26.530 --> 56:29.540
Go!

56:29.540 --> 56:33.540
-Go!
- I'm trying!

56:33.540 --> 56:35.550
Ahh! Jesus!

56:59.580 --> 57:03.580
That's your last little
stunt, Mr. Crocodile.

57:03.580 --> 57:05.580
You're grounded.

57:05.580 --> 57:06.590
This is some very
delicate equipment

57:06.590 --> 57:07.590
that you're throwing around.

57:07.590 --> 57:09.590
I don't care.
You trying to kill your self.

57:09.590 --> 57:11.590
You want to meet
Your maker, is that it?

57:11.590 --> 57:12.590
You might think they're godly,

57:12.590 --> 57:14.600
you might get some spiritual lift

57:14.600 --> 57:15.600
out of backstroking with dragons,

57:15.600 --> 57:18.600
but you just put a deputy
at risk out there, sir.

57:18.600 --> 57:20.600
Let's not overlook the fact
that he didn't eat me.

57:20.600 --> 57:23.610
'Cause he just ate a cow, stupid.

57:23.610 --> 57:25.610
I'm a civilian.
I'm not a trout.

57:25.610 --> 57:26.610
You have no authority
over me whatsoever.

57:27.610 --> 57:28.610
You have no authority
over me whatsoever.

57:28.610 --> 57:29.610
Hey, hey, I can arrest you.

57:30.620 --> 57:32.620
Well, then do it.

57:32.620 --> 57:34.620
You hurt his feelings.

57:34.620 --> 57:36.620
I don't care.
Do you care?

57:36.620 --> 57:40.630
No. He's an asshole.

57:53.640 --> 57:55.650
Did you want to be killed by it?

57:55.650 --> 57:57.650
You think I'm that nuts?

57:57.650 --> 57:58.650
Hector.

57:58.650 --> 58:00.650
What you just did,

58:00.650 --> 58:03.660
there had to be at least some
sort of a death wish going on.

58:03.660 --> 58:05.660
In ancient Melanesia,

58:05.660 --> 58:07.660
people suspected of crimes

58:07.660 --> 58:10.670
would be thrown
to the crocodiles.

58:10.670 --> 58:11.670
Crocodiles would decide.

58:11.670 --> 58:13.670
They would be the judge.

58:13.670 --> 58:17.680
Oh, and so that was you
wanting to be judged out there?

58:17.680 --> 58:19.680
Maybe I was, and so what?

58:19.680 --> 58:21.680
Is that too arbitrary?

58:21.680 --> 58:24.680
Better to be measured by my wealth?

58:24.680 --> 58:26.690
Better for me
to get my self-esteem

58:26.690 --> 58:28.690
looking in the eyes
of cheap sycophants

58:28.690 --> 58:29.690
craving a meal ticket?

58:29.690 --> 58:31.690
There was more honesty
in those dragon's eyes.

58:31.690 --> 58:33.700
There was more dignity
in those dragon's eyes.

58:33.700 --> 58:34.700
Jesus, Hector, cut the shit.

58:34.700 --> 58:36.700
Aw, fuck it.

58:36.700 --> 58:40.700
So, can I tell them you won't
go back in the water?

58:40.700 --> 58:41.710
Oh, yeah, sure.

58:41.710 --> 58:42.710
I'm not going back in the water.

58:42.710 --> 58:44.710
No way I'm going
back in the water.

58:44.710 --> 58:46.710
Ok.

58:46.710 --> 58:50.720
Kelly.

58:51.720 --> 58:55.720
We can't let 'em kill it.

59:02.730 --> 59:05.740
Yeah,
pull all the trucks in

59:05.740 --> 59:07.740
and start packing.

59:07.740 --> 59:08.740
Everything?

59:08.740 --> 59:09.740
Yeah.

59:09.740 --> 59:10.740
All right.

59:10.740 --> 59:13.750
Just heard from Wildlife
and Florida Fish and Game.

59:13.750 --> 59:14.750
They're gonna be here in 3 hours.

59:14.750 --> 59:16.750
Ok.

59:16.750 --> 59:18.750
So we might as well pack up.

59:18.750 --> 59:20.760
Good idea.

59:20.760 --> 59:23.760
Will they try to trap him?

59:23.760 --> 59:24.760
Sorry?

59:24.760 --> 59:26.760
Florida Fish and Game.

59:26.760 --> 59:28.770
What'll they do
when they get here?

59:28.770 --> 59:32.770
Tell her, Jack.

59:32.770 --> 59:35.770
Won't be able to snag him
in pitments, right?

59:35.770 --> 59:37.780
And you tranq him in the water,

59:37.780 --> 59:38.780
and he drowns.

59:38.780 --> 59:40.780
They could try
to tranq him on land.

59:40.780 --> 59:42.780
Oh, sure, they could,
but they won't.

59:42.780 --> 59:43.780
He's taken human life.

59:43.780 --> 59:44.790
The mission will be
to put him down.

59:44.790 --> 59:46.790
Is that true?

59:46.790 --> 59:50.790
They've never been able
to trap anything 30 feet.

59:50.790 --> 59:52.800
But they have to try, right?

59:52.800 --> 59:54.800
Where are they gonna
take him, Florida?

59:54.800 --> 59:55.800
Back to Asia?

59:55.800 --> 59:57.800
I got enough flaxidyl
with me to put him out--

59:57.800 --> 59:58.800
Forget it.

59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.810
Jack, hear me out.

01:00:01.810 --> 01:00:02.810
I know I'm a fat,
rich, nut fuck, wacko

01:00:02.810 --> 01:00:04.810
who's about as grounded
as a street pigeon,

01:00:04.810 --> 01:00:06.810
Keep going.

01:00:06.810 --> 01:00:08.820
But this thing...

01:00:08.820 --> 01:00:10.820
Here?

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:13.820
Maine?

01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:14.820
30 feet?

01:00:14.820 --> 01:00:16.830
Don't you think we're dealing

01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:18.830
with a bit of a miracle?

01:00:18.830 --> 01:00:20.830
Yeah. The miracle would be
to take him alive.

01:00:20.830 --> 01:00:22.830
Yeah, but if we could
neutralize him--

01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:23.840
How are we gonna neutralize him?

01:00:23.840 --> 01:00:25.840
Lure him on land
and pump him full of drugs.

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:26.840
Oh, right.

01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:28.840
I know of an empty
oil tank in Portland.

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.840
If we drugged him, we
could contain him there.

01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:32.850
He's 150 years old.

01:00:32.850 --> 01:00:36.850
He probably swam here
from another continent.

01:00:36.850 --> 01:00:38.850
He's migrated to Maine.

01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:41.860
How the hell do we say
we just kill it?

01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:43.860
Jack, this thing being here

01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:45.860
does have some
ecological significance.

01:00:45.860 --> 01:00:47.870
And you are in the business

01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:49.870
of protecting things
against extinction.

01:00:49.870 --> 01:00:51.870
Including deputies.

01:00:51.870 --> 01:00:52.870
I understand that,

01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:54.870
but if it's possible
to take him alive--

01:00:54.870 --> 01:00:55.880
No, it's not possible.

01:00:55.880 --> 01:00:57.880
Look, he follows anything
that moves, right?

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:00.880
We set a trap on the beach.
I got enough net--

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:02.880
No. There's no net
that's gonna hold him.

01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:03.890
It'll keep him
tangled long enough

01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:05.890
for the drugs to kick in.

01:01:05.890 --> 01:01:06.890
For God's sake, Jack,

01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:08.890
they've trapped crocs
bigger than 20 feet.

01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:11.900
This is not completely
out of the question.

01:01:11.900 --> 01:01:12.900
It's possible, and you know that.

01:01:12.900 --> 01:01:14.900
And those fucks from
Florida won't even try,

01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:17.900
and you know that, too.

01:01:17.900 --> 01:01:19.910
I got the drugs.
He's got a big cannon

01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:22.910
if anything goes wrong.

01:01:22.910 --> 01:01:24.910
How do you get him to the net?

01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:26.910
Ask Mrs. Bickerman
to call him?

01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:27.920
You guys can be in the trucks

01:01:27.920 --> 01:01:28.920
with the tranq guns.

01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:29.920
If he charges, you take off.

01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:31.920
He's not that fast.

01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:35.930
We just have to try.

01:01:35.930 --> 01:01:39.930
One try.
Just one try.

01:01:40.930 --> 01:01:41.930
Like Hank says,

01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:44.940
how would we lure him in?

01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:46.940
I'll sue you!

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:47.940
Go ahead.

01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:51.950
You can't take a cow
by eminent domain!

01:01:51.950 --> 01:01:52.950
We just did!

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:55.950
We won't let her get hurt, ma'am.

01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:57.950
You're all cock suckers!

01:01:57.950 --> 01:02:00.960
I knew at first.
I just didn't want to say it.

01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.960
We know what we're doing.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:07.970
We got a cow hanging
from a helicopter.

01:02:08.970 --> 01:02:09.970
Not much drag.

01:02:09.970 --> 01:02:13.980
As long as I can keep her
from swinging, we're ok.

01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.990
We're doing the right thing.

01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:24.990
You might feel different
if you get eaten.

01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:28.990
Yeah, thanks.

01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:42.010
Tranq gun with every rifle.

01:02:42.010 --> 01:02:46.020
That's as far back
as it goes, right?

01:02:54.030 --> 01:02:56.030
Hector, keep enough
tension to hold her up.

01:02:56.030 --> 01:02:58.030
We don't know
how well she can swim.

01:02:58.030 --> 01:03:02.040
Right.

01:03:07.040 --> 01:03:09.040
I hate to say it.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:12.050
The more she thrashes,
the better.

01:03:12.050 --> 01:03:14.050
You ready
on shore?

01:03:14.050 --> 01:03:16.050
Yeah,
we're all right. We're ready.

01:03:16.050 --> 01:03:20.060
Ok.

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:24.060
If she gets tired, pull her out.

01:03:25.070 --> 01:03:27.070
Jack:
What's she doing now?

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:31.070
She's trying to fly.

01:03:31.070 --> 01:03:35.080
This is not a happy cow.

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.080
I'm rooting for the crocodile.

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.080
I hope he swallows
Your friends whole.

01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:42.090
You might want to arrest
me for that, too.

01:03:42.090 --> 01:03:44.090
Is that a crime--

01:03:44.090 --> 01:03:47.090
To wish the chewing
of law enforcement?

01:03:47.090 --> 01:03:50.100
I'm not sure, ma'am.

01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.100
You got 'em?

01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:54.100
Yeah, over here.

01:03:54.100 --> 01:03:56.100
Little battery!

01:03:56.100 --> 01:03:58.110
What's the deal?

01:03:58.110 --> 01:04:00.110
Well, we tried.

01:04:00.110 --> 01:04:03.110
Just a little longer, please.

01:04:03.110 --> 01:04:05.120
She doesn't seem to be swimming.

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:07.120
No, she's floating.

01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.120
She looks like a giant tea bag.

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:11.120
Ok, Hector.

01:04:11.120 --> 01:04:14.130
Good plan, bad bait.
Game's up.

01:04:14.130 --> 01:04:17.130
The cow disappoints me.

01:04:18.130 --> 01:04:21.140
Hold on.

01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:22.140
I got something on the screen.

01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:24.140
What do you got?

01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:25.140
He's coming.

01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:27.140
Where?

01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:28.140
How far out?

01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:30.150
30 meters or so.

01:04:30.150 --> 01:04:32.150
He's moving slow,
but he's definitely coming.

01:04:32.150 --> 01:04:35.150
Can you confirm visually
or just radar?

01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:36.150
Radar.

01:04:36.150 --> 01:04:37.160
He's underwater,

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:39.160
but he is coming!

01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:41.160
All right, everybody
back in the trucks!

01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:43.160
Move, move, move!

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:44.160
Let's go, let's go!

01:04:44.160 --> 01:04:45.170
Let's go!

01:04:45.170 --> 01:04:46.170
Lead him in.

01:04:46.170 --> 01:04:50.170
On our way.

01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:57.180
Remember to aim
for the stomach and the sides!

01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:01.190
These darts
won't pierce his back!

01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:04.190
He's surfacing.
There's his snout.

01:05:04.190 --> 01:05:06.190
There he is!

01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:08.190
We've spotted him, Hector.

01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:11.200
You little snacker.

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:13.200
If he gets near her, pull up.

01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:15.200
She's worried about the cow now.

01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:19.210
Nice and slow, Hector.

01:05:21.210 --> 01:05:23.210
This net thing better work.

01:05:23.210 --> 01:05:24.220
He got you with it.

01:05:26.220 --> 01:05:29.220
We're in about 4 feet
of water now.

01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:32.230
She's mooing.

01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:34.230
You wouldn't?

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:36.230
She's also kicking.

01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:39.230
A little closer, Hector.

01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:53.250
Oh, shit.

01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:58.260
Watch out!

01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:09.270
Motherfucker!

01:06:10.270 --> 01:06:12.280
Shit!

01:06:12.280 --> 01:06:13.280
Where is he?

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:17.280
We gotta get to him.

01:06:18.280 --> 01:06:20.290
Back us up.

01:06:20.290 --> 01:06:22.290
Lose the tranq guns.
Go to the rifles.

01:06:22.290 --> 01:06:24.290
Get the rifles!

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:43.320
Where'd he go?

01:06:43.320 --> 01:06:44.320
Hold up.

01:06:44.320 --> 01:06:46.320
Don't go back into the water.

01:06:46.320 --> 01:06:49.320
If you get a safe shot, take it.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:53.330
Do not move, Hector!

01:06:56.330 --> 01:06:58.330
Can you see anything
from out there?

01:06:58.330 --> 01:07:00.340
Nothing!

01:07:00.340 --> 01:07:04.340
Maybe he swam back out!

01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:07.350
Jesus!

01:07:07.350 --> 01:07:09.350
Hector!

01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:10.350
Hey!

01:07:10.350 --> 01:07:11.350
Get back in the truck!

01:07:11.350 --> 01:07:15.360
I got him covered.

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:21.360
Where is he?

01:07:21.360 --> 01:07:22.370
I don't know.

01:07:22.370 --> 01:07:26.370
He's gone under.

01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:37.380
I just have this feeling
everything's totally safe.

01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:43.390
There!

01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:44.390
He's swimming out!

01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:45.390
I think I see him!

01:07:45.390 --> 01:07:49.400
I think I see his tail!

01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:05.420
Shit! Kelly!

01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:07.420
Aah!

01:08:21.439 --> 01:08:25.450
Kelly!

01:08:34.460 --> 01:08:36.460
Kelly, swim, swim to me!

01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:40.460
Swim to me, Kelly!

01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:43.470
Shoot the fucking thing!

01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:47.470
I don't have a clean shot.

01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:49.479
Dive under!

01:08:49.479 --> 01:08:53.479
Go under!

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:58.490
Fuck.

01:09:17.510 --> 01:09:18.510
"Let's save him."

01:09:18.510 --> 01:09:22.520
What a fucking great idea.

01:09:47.550 --> 01:09:50.550
Come on.

01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:51.560
Here.

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:54.560
Here we go.

01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:56.560
Where is he?

01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.560
I don't know.

01:09:57.560 --> 01:09:59.560
We can't see him.

01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:03.570
What-What?

01:10:07.570 --> 01:10:11.580
Hector!

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.600
All right.

01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:28.600
Game over.

01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:29.600
Look.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.610
He's suffering.

01:10:32.610 --> 01:10:34.610
I get to be humane.

01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:36.610
No, no!

01:10:36.610 --> 01:10:38.610
No, no, no, look, he's trapped!

01:10:38.610 --> 01:10:41.620
We've done it!

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.620
So what? It's not a net,
but he's trapped.

01:10:43.620 --> 01:10:45.620
Mission accomplished.

01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:46.620
Shoot him.

01:10:46.620 --> 01:10:47.630
I got more drugs.
He's half dead.

01:10:47.630 --> 01:10:51.630
He's half alive.
Shoot him!

01:11:03.650 --> 01:11:07.650
The drugs are kicking in.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.680
Look at him.

01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:33.680
He's done.

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:34.690
Hank.

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:37.690
All right, stand back.

01:11:37.690 --> 01:11:39.690
No, no, no, Sheriff.

01:11:39.690 --> 01:11:40.690
Look.

01:11:40.690 --> 01:11:42.700
Look, look.

01:11:42.700 --> 01:11:43.700
He's got nothing left.

01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:47.700
Go ahead.
Shoot him.

01:11:53.710 --> 01:11:55.710
Really?

01:11:55.710 --> 01:11:56.710
-Jack, we don't--
- Kelly.

01:11:56.710 --> 01:11:58.710
We don't have to destroy him!

01:11:58.710 --> 01:12:02.720
God damn it, look at him!

01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:06.730
Let me have that.

01:12:06.730 --> 01:12:07.730
Kelly:
He's been neutralized.

01:12:07.730 --> 01:12:09.730
Come on, Jack,
he's trapped!

01:12:09.730 --> 01:12:10.730
Look at him!
He can't move!

01:12:10.730 --> 01:12:11.730
What's the point?

01:12:11.730 --> 01:12:12.730
We don't have to do this.

01:12:12.730 --> 01:12:16.740
Jack, you don't have to.
Please!

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.760
Oh, God!

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.760
He's got me!

01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:35.760
Jesus!

01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:36.760
Jesus Christ!

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:39.770
Are there 2?
I think there's 2.

01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:41.770
I can see that.

01:12:41.770 --> 01:12:42.770
He bit me!

01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:44.770
He bit me!
There's 2,there's 2!

01:12:44.770 --> 01:12:48.780
I can count.

01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:52.780
No!

01:12:56.790 --> 01:13:00.790
Back to one.

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:03.800
Go ahead.

01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:07.800
Flax him.

01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:16.810
Oh, here they are.

01:13:16.810 --> 01:13:20.820
Just in time.
Nice to see you.

01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:29.830
We're gonna need
to get this reptile

01:13:29.830 --> 01:13:31.830
some medical attention.

01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:33.840
We, uh...

01:13:33.840 --> 01:13:37.840
trapped him with our chopper.

01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:53.860
Portland?

01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:54.860
Yes, Portland.

01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:56.870
They'll tank him there
until we figure out

01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:58.870
something better to do.

01:13:58.870 --> 01:14:00.870
So, Sheriff, Sheriff,

01:14:00.870 --> 01:14:02.870
you got to fire
your big gun finally.

01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:03.880
Was it fun?

01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:06.880
Overrated.

01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:07.880
What'd Bickerman say?

01:14:07.880 --> 01:14:09.880
Well, she didn't want to tell us

01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:11.890
about the second croc,

01:14:11.890 --> 01:14:13.890
'cause she was afraid
we'd blow its head off.

01:14:13.890 --> 01:14:17.890
Women's intuition.

01:14:17.890 --> 01:14:18.890
We got room for one more.

01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:20.900
Someone should
probably go with him.

01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:21.900
Uh...

01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:24.900
I'm still packing up some stuff,

01:14:24.900 --> 01:14:27.910
but, uh...

01:14:27.910 --> 01:14:29.910
I'll go.

01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:31.910
So, I imagine you're gonna have

01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:34.910
a few reports to do.

01:14:34.910 --> 01:14:36.920
If you need anything, let me know.

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:40.920
Yeah. It was nice meeting you.

01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:44.930
Gee, Hank,
don't get all choked up.

01:14:44.930 --> 01:14:46.930
With you, I'm still mixed.

01:14:46.930 --> 01:14:50.930
Oh, well, then, just to
offend you on principle, then.

01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:56.940
See you.

01:15:03.950 --> 01:15:04.950
Well...

01:15:04.950 --> 01:15:06.950
You want a ride in my truck?

01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:07.960
Oh, we just finished

01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:09.960
loading up the front oft he truck.

01:15:09.960 --> 01:15:10.960
Do you want us to
take some stuff out?

01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:12.960
No, no, that's all right.

01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:13.960
I'm gonna be
a little while anyway.

01:15:13.960 --> 01:15:15.970
I want to go say
good-bye to the lake.

01:15:15.970 --> 01:15:18.970
You sure, because
I don't mind--

01:15:18.970 --> 01:15:21.970
No. I actually want
to stay a little longer.

01:15:21.970 --> 01:15:26.980
All right.

01:15:27.980 --> 01:15:29.980
If I'm ever in New York, I'll...

01:15:29.980 --> 01:15:33.990
Yeah.

01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:40.000
Yeah.

01:15:55.020 --> 01:15:59.020
So, does nobody ever
make a move in Maine?

01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:04.030
That's it?
You slide your duffel bag?

01:16:04.030 --> 01:16:06.030
Just...

01:16:06.030 --> 01:16:07.030
get in the truck.

01:16:07.030 --> 01:16:09.030
Go for a beer.

01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:11.040
There's a good bar in town.

01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:13.040
Bet that's charming.

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.040
Are the glasses clean?

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:16.040
Mostly.

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:19.050
You gonna complain
the whole time?

01:16:19.050 --> 01:16:20.050
Jack.

01:16:20.050 --> 01:16:24.050
Start the truck.

01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:32.060
I already miss the crocodile.

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:19.120
Cute little buttons.
Oh, ho ho.

01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:22.130
Oh, mama loves you.

01:17:22.130 --> 01:17:23.130
Come on.

01:17:23.130 --> 01:17:25.130
Eat your supper.

01:17:25.130 --> 01:17:27.130
Nibble mommy's toes.

01:17:27.130 --> 01:17:28.130
Yes.
