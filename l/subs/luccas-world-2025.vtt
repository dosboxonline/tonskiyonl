THIS AUDIOVISUAL WORK IS BASED
ON THE FACTS NARRATED ON THE BOOK

00:09.750 --> 00:11.958
THE TWO HEMISPHERES OF LUCCA
BY BÁRBARA ANDERSON.

00:12.041 --> 00:14.458
CERTAIN EVENTS, SCENES,
CHARACTERS, AND DIALOGUES

00:14.541 --> 00:16.541
HAVE BEEN ALTERED FOR DRAMATIC PURPOSES.

00:43.750 --> 00:46.291
How about you? Still think it's a boy?

00:46.375 --> 00:48.833
It's not that I think it's a boy.
It is a boy!

00:48.916 --> 00:51.041
-It kicks like a girl.
-It doesn't.

00:51.125 --> 00:53.416
-What?
-It does. Boys kick harder.

00:53.500 --> 00:54.750
What do you know?

00:59.666 --> 01:00.833
-Do you feel that?
-Yes.

01:05.208 --> 01:06.208
It's ready.

01:06.791 --> 01:07.750
It is ready.

01:12.458 --> 01:14.583
-Hi, good evening.
-Hello.

01:14.666 --> 01:16.250
-Hi.
-I think I'm in labor.

01:16.333 --> 01:19.958
The doctor told me to come
when the contractions were regular.

01:20.041 --> 01:22.708
And now they're like ten minutes apart.

01:22.791 --> 01:23.625
Or less.

01:23.708 --> 01:25.166
-Is this your first birth?
-Yes.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.958
-And has your water broken?
-No.

01:27.041 --> 01:29.250
It could still take hours… or days.

01:29.916 --> 01:31.208
-Listen…
-Yes?

01:31.291 --> 01:33.375
I would recommend
for you to go get some rest

01:33.458 --> 01:37.541
and come back when the contractions
are about five minutes apart.

01:39.958 --> 01:40.833
-Okay.
-All right.

01:42.833 --> 01:43.833
What?

01:44.458 --> 01:46.041
-Oh, well.
-Let's see.

01:46.791 --> 01:48.708
No. Easy, breathe.

01:48.791 --> 01:49.875
Help. Breathe.

01:51.708 --> 01:53.833
-Monkey. Are you okay?
-Here's another one.

01:54.333 --> 01:57.750
Another one. And it's been less
than three minutes since the last one.

02:01.708 --> 02:04.875
-No, I need that.
-You won't need it. Don't worry.

02:04.958 --> 02:06.291
Where's my husband?

02:06.375 --> 02:08.416
He's getting changed.
He shouldn't be long.

02:08.916 --> 02:10.791
-Be careful with the IV.
-Come on…

02:11.291 --> 02:12.458
Lift your legs.

02:12.541 --> 02:14.875
Dilation is at six centimeters.

02:15.458 --> 02:16.958
We'll give you an epidural.

02:17.041 --> 02:17.958
Doc.

02:18.458 --> 02:19.666
-Help me turn her.
-Yes.

02:19.750 --> 02:21.208
Okay, ma'am. Come on.

02:22.708 --> 02:24.375
You'll feel a little sting.

02:25.750 --> 02:28.625
On the next contraction,
push really hard, okay?

02:29.916 --> 02:31.458
-Let's see.
-Hi, Monkey.

02:31.541 --> 02:32.458
There we go.

02:32.541 --> 02:34.416
-Let's see.
-Everything will be fine.

02:36.958 --> 02:38.958
Push, mommy. Push.

02:41.625 --> 02:43.208
Harder, mommy!

02:44.125 --> 02:46.541
-I can't.
-You can do it, Bárbara.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.416
-One more push, and that's it.
-The baby has bradycardia.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.083
-Come on.
-Push.

02:51.583 --> 02:53.291
One more push, and that's it.

02:54.041 --> 02:56.375
Come on, mommy.
Push harder. Push, mommy.

02:56.458 --> 02:58.666
-Heart rate dropping.
-Come on, Bárbara.

02:59.458 --> 03:01.458
BASED ON THE BOOK
THE TWO HEMISPHERES OF LUCCA

03:01.541 --> 03:03.333
Push, mommy, harder.

03:03.416 --> 03:04.958
-One, two…
-A spark.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.833
Excuse me, I'm leaking milk.

03:26.916 --> 03:28.875
When will you bring me my baby?

03:28.958 --> 03:30.791
One moment. I'll go ask.

03:30.875 --> 03:32.125
Okay, thanks.

03:53.250 --> 03:54.291
Good morning.

03:56.208 --> 03:57.833
As the doctor explained,

03:58.416 --> 04:02.000
we need to wait 72 hours
for brain swelling to subside.

04:02.583 --> 04:04.958
In the meantime,
we have him in an induced coma.

04:05.791 --> 04:08.000
Well, I'll leave you
with him for a little while.

04:08.500 --> 04:09.416
Thank you.

04:18.583 --> 04:19.583
Hi, sweetie.

04:21.875 --> 04:22.833
Hi, baby.

04:23.583 --> 04:25.250
Oh, Luquita, forgive me.

04:27.375 --> 04:29.416
Forgive me for not knowing how to push.

04:36.916 --> 04:37.875
Oh, sweetie.

04:39.750 --> 04:41.791
I promise you I'll fix this.

04:45.083 --> 04:48.125
I promise I won't rest until you are well.

05:02.666 --> 05:03.625
WHAT HAPPENED TO US?

05:03.708 --> 05:06.916
The first tests they did to you
when you were only three days old

05:07.000 --> 05:08.833
seemed to be good news.

05:09.583 --> 05:11.791
We thought, "The hardest part is over."

05:12.416 --> 05:15.500
But ten days later, everything changed.

05:15.583 --> 05:18.916
The giant scar that oxygen deprivation
caused in your brain

05:19.416 --> 05:21.500
wouldn't let you talk or walk

05:21.583 --> 05:23.708
or control your movements.

05:23.791 --> 05:26.375
Some doctors suggested
that the damage in your brain

05:26.458 --> 05:29.000
wouldn't even let you know
that I'm your mom.

05:29.958 --> 05:31.916
But I never believed them, Luqui.

05:34.625 --> 05:37.416
And when your brother was born,
it became clearer.

05:37.916 --> 05:40.291
Bruno always knew how to enter your world

05:40.375 --> 05:42.458
and how to communicate with you.

05:42.541 --> 05:44.458
He's the best thing
that's ever happened to you.

05:44.541 --> 05:47.541
But still, watching him run
and explore the world out there

05:47.625 --> 05:50.375
makes my frustration
of seeing you trapped even bigger.

05:50.458 --> 05:51.333
TRAPPED

05:51.416 --> 05:54.541
That's why we've tried
and will keep trying everything.

05:54.625 --> 05:57.250
Every therapy, every new machine.

05:57.333 --> 06:01.250
Every new doctor
and every treatment is new hope.

06:01.875 --> 06:03.166
NEW HOPE

06:03.250 --> 06:05.333
Your future remains a mystery.

06:06.166 --> 06:09.208
We still don't know
all the limits that restrain you.

06:10.416 --> 06:11.583
But we're a team.

06:12.708 --> 06:14.958
We'll stay together until the end.

06:15.458 --> 06:18.333
Every day and every night,
until we find the way.

06:21.166 --> 06:26.250
LUCCA'S WORLD

06:38.333 --> 06:39.666
Good morning, my love.

06:41.541 --> 06:43.083
How are you, sunshine?

06:47.250 --> 06:48.791
Can you help me hold him?

06:49.333 --> 06:50.916
Monkey. Hi, Luquita.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.625
Has anyone seen Pipo Rex?

06:55.708 --> 06:57.208
Can you pass me a diaper, Monkey?

07:02.583 --> 07:05.291
Do you know why Lucca
isn't eating his purée?

07:06.250 --> 07:07.125
Why?

07:07.208 --> 07:09.500
It has papaya. He doesn't like it.

07:09.583 --> 07:11.375
Really? And how do you know?

07:11.458 --> 07:14.416
Because papaya tastes
like rotten cheese in a diaper.

07:14.500 --> 07:15.625
Of course not.

07:15.708 --> 07:16.958
Papayas are delicious.

07:17.041 --> 07:19.958
Thousands of children
in Iceland would kill to try one.

07:20.041 --> 07:21.750
How about we send one to them?

07:23.041 --> 07:24.625
No, he doesn't like it.

07:24.708 --> 07:26.250
Yes he does. Right, Lu?

07:27.125 --> 07:29.791
Can I leave the car with you,
and you take Lucca?

07:30.583 --> 07:33.041
Yes. I'd have to leave now.
I have that interview.

07:33.125 --> 07:34.833
Oh, right. Good luck.

07:34.916 --> 07:35.875
Something good?

07:36.791 --> 07:39.458
I don't know about the pay. We'll see.

07:39.541 --> 07:41.416
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

07:41.500 --> 07:44.125
They moved the rehab
to eight o'clock. Can you make it?

07:44.208 --> 07:45.041
Swimming class?

07:45.125 --> 07:48.166
No, the appointment
with the new physiotherapist.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.958
The one who also uses
the magnets. I told you.

07:51.916 --> 07:52.833
No.

07:52.916 --> 07:55.041
When I get off work, I'll pick up Lucca.

07:55.125 --> 07:56.416
We'll have lunch with you guys.

07:56.916 --> 07:58.500
Then we'll go to the allergist.

07:58.583 --> 08:01.416
Then we'll get the new insoles
that still need adjustment.

08:01.500 --> 08:04.375
You wait for them to be ready.
I'll take them to swim class.

08:04.458 --> 08:07.416
I'll bring Bruno home,
and you take Lucca to the new therapy.

08:07.958 --> 08:09.000
All of that is today?

08:09.083 --> 08:11.458
Are you crazy?
We'll end up in the hospital.

08:11.541 --> 08:12.416
Don't overreact.

08:12.500 --> 08:15.333
This is why I married you.
And because of your looks.

08:18.083 --> 08:20.375
These are ready
for you to review when you can.

08:20.875 --> 08:21.916
Good morning.

08:25.041 --> 08:25.875
Hi, Fanny.

08:25.958 --> 08:27.125
BUSINESSWOMAN OF THE YEAR

08:27.208 --> 08:28.708
Good morning, guys.

08:28.791 --> 08:30.958
Hi, Bárbara.
Hey, you never sent me the calendar.

08:31.041 --> 08:34.375
-Yes, I sent it to you earlier.
-Why are you up at three in the morning?

08:35.250 --> 08:36.875
Barbie, good morning.

08:36.958 --> 08:37.875
Hello.

08:37.958 --> 08:39.625
They just confirmed Lizárraga.

08:39.708 --> 08:42.000
Think we'll have time
for him to be our cover?

08:43.750 --> 08:45.708
I swear I was going
to make it on time, Monkey.

08:45.791 --> 08:48.375
The interview was rescheduled
at the last minute, really.

08:48.458 --> 08:51.041
It's fine. I'll pick up
the insoles tomorrow.

08:51.125 --> 08:52.541
Okay? See you at home.

08:52.625 --> 08:53.625
-Bye.
-Bye.

08:58.750 --> 09:01.541
Maybe you wonder
why we run all the time, Luqui.

09:02.666 --> 09:05.916
Why we spend our afternoons
going from one therapy to another.

09:06.500 --> 09:09.416
What am I looking for
when I know nothing changes?

09:11.875 --> 09:15.250
But I need to open
all the doors that are closed to you.

09:15.750 --> 09:19.000
Carry your chair
up all those stairs with no ramps.

09:19.916 --> 09:22.875
Do what the world denies us every day.

09:56.958 --> 09:58.583
Lucca? Lucca, are you okay?

09:58.666 --> 09:59.500
Bárbara!

10:00.000 --> 10:01.541
He's having a seizure!

10:08.125 --> 10:09.125
Okay…

10:09.208 --> 10:11.583
-How long has it been?
-It just happened.

10:13.041 --> 10:15.208
Fifteen, sixteen.

10:15.291 --> 10:17.416
Seventeen, eighteen…

10:29.708 --> 10:31.000
Monkey, I'm here.

10:31.083 --> 10:35.083
You were right when you said
we'd end up in the hospital. I feel awful.

10:35.166 --> 10:37.291
No, I didn't mean it like this.

10:37.375 --> 10:39.666
You do everything right, Monkey.

10:39.750 --> 10:41.541
Oh, you're freezing. Here.

10:45.416 --> 10:46.333
How was it?

10:46.833 --> 10:47.708
Awful?

10:48.250 --> 10:50.000
-Yes.
-I'm sorry.

11:25.250 --> 11:26.291
There we go.

11:27.583 --> 11:30.375
Lucca, how come you're
such a handsome boy, huh?

11:33.625 --> 11:34.541
You know?

11:35.416 --> 11:36.416
When I was your age,

11:37.500 --> 11:39.375
I liked to imagine I could fly.

11:39.458 --> 11:43.000
I imagined going up
to the top floor of the school,

11:44.125 --> 11:45.833
jumping off, and flying away.

11:47.083 --> 11:48.250
And you, my Luqui?

11:49.583 --> 11:51.375
Have you ever imagined you can fly?

11:55.833 --> 11:57.125
Give me your hand.

11:58.291 --> 11:59.125
That's it.

12:06.208 --> 12:07.208
That's it.

12:11.625 --> 12:13.916
It's eight o'clock.
I have an interview in an hour.

12:14.000 --> 12:14.833
Seriously?

12:14.916 --> 12:16.208
-Yes.
-Can't you reschedule?

12:18.000 --> 12:20.125
No. Do I look awful?

12:21.666 --> 12:22.750
From one to ten?

12:24.083 --> 12:25.333
Watch it.

12:25.916 --> 12:26.750
Bye.

12:33.250 --> 12:34.166
Hello.

12:39.000 --> 12:40.166
Damn it!

12:43.125 --> 12:44.041
So awful.

12:51.250 --> 12:52.875
All right, talk to you later.

12:53.375 --> 12:55.500
Mr. Alberto, a pleasure. Bárbara Anderson.

12:55.583 --> 12:56.916
Likewise. Please have a seat.

12:57.000 --> 12:57.875
Thanks.

12:58.375 --> 13:01.041
We're very excited about your profile.

13:01.125 --> 13:04.083
-They told you that you'll be the cover?
-Yes, thank you very much.

13:04.166 --> 13:05.291
Have you had breakfast?

13:05.375 --> 13:07.375
-Want anything to drink?
-Yes. Don't worry.

13:07.875 --> 13:08.916
I'll order something.

13:09.416 --> 13:10.916
-Is everything okay?
-Yes.

13:13.750 --> 13:16.583
Listen, I'm sorry for being pushy,
but are you okay?

13:17.875 --> 13:19.208
Do you really want to know?

13:19.291 --> 13:20.291
Well, yes.

13:20.375 --> 13:24.000
My son Lucca had an epileptic seizure
yesterday at the swimming pool.

13:24.083 --> 13:26.958
And we rushed him to the hospital,
he was admitted…

13:27.041 --> 13:29.041
I came straight here
after pulling an all-nighter.

13:29.625 --> 13:32.250
Tell me, was it the first time
this had happened to him?

13:32.333 --> 13:35.000
No. His condition makes him susceptible.

13:35.083 --> 13:36.416
What is his condition?

13:36.500 --> 13:39.375
Infantile cerebral palsy… severe.

13:40.375 --> 13:43.625
Is he on any treatment
to improve his condition?

13:44.750 --> 13:46.750
Unfortunately, no.

13:46.833 --> 13:50.958
There's no treatment to make him better.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.333
The damage is irreversible.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.916
But how can there be no treatment?

13:57.416 --> 13:59.041
There's treatment for everything.

13:59.125 --> 14:00.916
Isn't your job to investigate?

14:02.000 --> 14:05.541
Excuse me for saying this,
with all due respect,

14:05.625 --> 14:06.625
you have no idea--

14:06.708 --> 14:07.958
No, hold on.

14:08.041 --> 14:09.791
Hold on, that came out wrong.

14:10.416 --> 14:11.416
Tell me something.

14:11.916 --> 14:13.916
Do you know who Bruno Bernardi is?

14:14.500 --> 14:16.833
-The former Secretary of Economy.
-Exactly.

14:17.333 --> 14:20.458
He had a very serious
cardiovascular event.

14:20.541 --> 14:22.875
It left him unable to speak or walk.

14:22.958 --> 14:25.250
Everybody told him he wouldn't recover.

14:25.333 --> 14:28.416
But he underwent treatment
with a very skilled Mexican doctor

14:28.500 --> 14:29.541
who works in India.

14:29.625 --> 14:31.333
And guess what? He recovered.

14:32.333 --> 14:36.041
Trust me, these aren't
any miracle drops or the like.

14:36.125 --> 14:37.125
In fact,

14:37.666 --> 14:40.333
I've got a video
so you can see for yourself.

14:44.875 --> 14:45.708
DAY ONE

14:45.791 --> 14:48.291
They put him in that machine
every day for a month.

14:48.375 --> 14:49.750
DAY TEN

14:49.833 --> 14:50.666
DAY 25

14:50.750 --> 14:53.416
Look how he started walking again.
He couldn't believe it himself.

14:54.375 --> 14:55.416
Is this real?

14:55.500 --> 14:57.500
In fact, it's scientifically supported.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.791
And I've got
his attending physician's number.

15:00.875 --> 15:01.791
In fact…

15:02.500 --> 15:05.083
If you don't mind,
we'll give him a quick call.

15:08.666 --> 15:09.875
Jaramillo!

15:11.458 --> 15:12.666
Were you asleep?

15:12.750 --> 15:16.125
Oh, right! I forgot you're in India.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.125
Listen, since you're up already,

15:18.208 --> 15:21.166
I need you to help
a friend who's here with me.

15:21.250 --> 15:25.208
Her son has cerebral palsy.
I told her about your invention.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.958
After my donation,
you can't say no to me, can you?

15:29.041 --> 15:29.875
Here.

16:01.125 --> 16:02.041
-Hello.
-Hi.

16:02.666 --> 16:03.541
What happened?

16:03.625 --> 16:07.208
After every epileptic seizure,
Lucca is knocked out

16:07.291 --> 16:09.708
for one or two days, unable to eat.

16:09.791 --> 16:12.625
That leads to more episodes.

16:12.708 --> 16:15.625
It's a cycle that's putting
his life at risk.

16:15.708 --> 16:16.583
Do you understand?

16:17.791 --> 16:19.750
I'm not thrilled,

16:19.833 --> 16:25.333
but I think we'd better
start considering the G-button.

16:25.416 --> 16:28.666
I understand your point, Doctor,
but we'd need to consider

16:28.750 --> 16:31.666
the new limitations
the device would bring Lucca.

16:31.750 --> 16:35.208
If he can't use his mouth to eat,
much less to speak, Doctor.

16:35.291 --> 16:39.541
Look, everything indicates
that Lucca's situation won't improve.

16:39.625 --> 16:41.583
He can't go on so malnourished.

16:42.958 --> 16:43.833
I say…

16:44.666 --> 16:45.500
Thank you.

16:47.458 --> 16:50.125
From day one,
they've told us everything is wrong.

16:50.625 --> 16:54.500
And the change
in Bernardi's video is truly amazing.

16:56.041 --> 16:57.500
Yeah, but his case is different.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.500
Listen, Bernardi was also told

16:59.583 --> 17:01.541
he'd never recover,
and he started walking again.

17:01.625 --> 17:03.791
Let's talk to this doctor
before we decide.

17:03.875 --> 17:06.541
You know my opinion on miracle treatments.

17:06.625 --> 17:07.833
I think they don't work.

17:07.916 --> 17:09.791
Well, we have nothing to lose.

17:14.458 --> 17:16.375
It went to voicemail. I'll text him.

17:17.750 --> 17:19.791
Oh no. Lucca woke up.

17:20.416 --> 17:22.416
-Let's go.
-No, you stay.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.708
I'll head over, all right?

17:46.166 --> 17:48.083
Monkey, wake up. It's the doctor.

17:48.166 --> 17:50.583
-Did he have another seizure?
-No, he's fine. He's asleep.

17:50.666 --> 17:52.791
It's the doctor from India. He's calling.

17:53.750 --> 17:56.000
We'll wake the children. This way.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.583
Just a second, Doctor. Hold on.

17:59.500 --> 18:00.333
Doctor…

18:00.875 --> 18:02.583
We finally meet.

18:02.666 --> 18:04.416
Thank you very much for returning my call.

18:04.500 --> 18:07.833
Alberto Lizárraga showed us
Bruno Bernardi's video,

18:07.916 --> 18:09.666
and we are really impressed.

18:09.750 --> 18:10.583
I can imagine.

18:10.666 --> 18:14.500
The Cytotron will mark a before and after
in the history of medicine.

18:14.583 --> 18:17.416
My colleagues at Harvard
can't believe it either.

18:17.500 --> 18:19.916
But as you saw, it is now a reality.

18:20.000 --> 18:21.083
Yes, it's amazing.

18:21.166 --> 18:23.333
Hello, Doctor. Nice to meet you.

18:23.833 --> 18:27.541
Our son Lucca has severe cerebral palsy

18:27.625 --> 18:30.041
with very frequent epileptic seizures.

18:30.125 --> 18:32.291
In fact, we're at the hospital right now.

18:32.375 --> 18:35.416
And we'd love to know more
about this treatment.

18:35.500 --> 18:39.125
Well, it's not that easy to understand.

18:39.625 --> 18:42.583
But in a nutshell,
let's say it's a machine

18:42.666 --> 18:47.333
that stimulates the brain cells
so they can become active

18:47.416 --> 18:49.250
and create new connections.

18:49.333 --> 18:52.083
Do you think this machine can help Lucca?

18:52.166 --> 18:55.875
The Cytotron has been used
to destroy tumors for many years.

18:56.375 --> 18:58.625
Its neurological use is new.

18:58.708 --> 19:00.583
But I can assure you,

19:00.666 --> 19:04.916
we've seen remarkable progress
in nearly all of our patients.

19:05.000 --> 19:08.333
We're definitely interested
in trying the treatment, Doctor.

19:08.416 --> 19:09.291
I'm glad.

19:09.375 --> 19:13.166
I'll give you my information
so you can send me his file,

19:13.250 --> 19:16.250
as well as all the costs
and other expenses.

19:16.333 --> 19:17.166
Excuse me.

19:17.250 --> 19:18.083
-Sure.
-Hi.

19:18.166 --> 19:20.416
Well, I have to go. We'll be in touch.

19:20.500 --> 19:24.125
Yes, Doctor. We'll send you
all the information. Thanks so much.

19:24.625 --> 19:25.625
See you.

19:27.750 --> 19:28.583
What?

19:29.083 --> 19:31.583
You can't trust every remedy
they wanna sell to us.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.541
-We're cannon fodder for these people.
-This time is different.

19:35.208 --> 19:37.125
I feel like this is our chance.

19:37.791 --> 19:38.625
I mean it.

19:38.708 --> 19:39.916
Wow!

19:40.000 --> 19:42.416
The closest thing to entertainment
I had on my planet

19:42.500 --> 19:44.375
was watching my wounds heal.

19:44.458 --> 19:46.708
Oh! That's… disgusting!

19:46.791 --> 19:48.833
I have a wound too.

19:49.791 --> 19:53.916
But I won't show you
the blood because you'll be shocked.

19:56.458 --> 19:58.250
Fifty thousand dollars, partner?

19:59.750 --> 20:01.833
Plus that guy's travel allowance,

20:02.958 --> 20:04.125
plus our travel expenses.

20:04.208 --> 20:06.583
The question isn't how much it costs,

20:07.625 --> 20:10.166
but whether this
is gonna help Lucca or not.

20:10.250 --> 20:14.125
And if this is the only way,
then money doesn't matter.

20:14.208 --> 20:15.916
It's not that we don't have money.

20:16.541 --> 20:19.041
We owe money.
Our credit cards are maxed out.

20:19.125 --> 20:23.083
Between doctors,
medicine, therapies, treatments.

20:23.166 --> 20:25.833
Where will we find the cash
for you to take Lucca to India?

20:25.916 --> 20:29.666
No. We're taking Lucca to India.
We are all going.

20:29.750 --> 20:31.583
We're all flying to India?

20:32.708 --> 20:35.333
Remember when we went
on a weekend trip? The car still reeks.

20:37.208 --> 20:38.833
How are we going to get that cash?

20:38.916 --> 20:42.333
You know that, moneywise,
this is the worst moment for me.

20:42.416 --> 20:44.791
I've been practically unemployed all year.

20:44.875 --> 20:47.375
It's okay. Better times are coming.

20:47.458 --> 20:50.291
Besides, we can always sell the apartment.

20:50.375 --> 20:51.208
What?

20:51.291 --> 20:53.708
This apartment is all we own.

20:53.791 --> 20:56.041
And we've worked so hard to get it.

20:56.125 --> 20:57.458
Oh no, don't be dramatic.

20:57.541 --> 20:59.250
I'm not. We aren't going to India.

20:59.333 --> 21:02.416
I'm usually in, but not this time.
We won't risk our only property

21:02.500 --> 21:06.708
for a so-called treatment
that they haven't fully explained to us.

21:08.791 --> 21:11.916
To me, this family is all we have.

21:13.208 --> 21:15.500
I know that. That's not
what we're talking about.

21:15.583 --> 21:18.541
I don't care if you think
rubbing my son with lavender oil

21:18.625 --> 21:20.333
is esoteric nonsense.

21:20.416 --> 21:22.708
Or if you think I'm freaking obsessed

21:22.791 --> 21:25.250
when I make him do breathing exercises.

21:25.333 --> 21:27.458
I don't care if you think this won't work.

21:27.541 --> 21:28.625
I think it will.

21:29.333 --> 21:31.666
And that will take us to India.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.041
Whether you like it or not.

21:45.416 --> 21:49.166
Have I told you that you've got
the most beautiful arms?

21:50.708 --> 21:52.333
And very soft skin.

21:57.208 --> 21:58.250
BALANCE

21:58.333 --> 22:00.083
DEBT

22:05.958 --> 22:07.500
ESTIMATE YOUR MORTGAGE

22:07.583 --> 22:09.166
NEED AN EXPRESS LOAN?

22:17.916 --> 22:19.416
Naye, help me hold him.

22:19.500 --> 22:20.875
Yeah. Let's see.

22:21.875 --> 22:22.708
That's it.

22:35.500 --> 22:36.458
Hello.

22:36.541 --> 22:37.375
Want dinner?

22:39.958 --> 22:41.875
No, I'm not hungry.

22:42.458 --> 22:45.416
But I'll finish with him
and I'll join you.

22:46.958 --> 22:47.791
Hey…

22:50.250 --> 22:53.916
It won't be that easy,
but we could mortgage the apartment.

23:09.333 --> 23:10.333
I love you.

23:18.541 --> 23:19.708
These streets…

23:21.750 --> 23:23.541
There we go.

23:24.500 --> 23:25.333
That's it!

23:27.583 --> 23:29.583
-Good morning.
-Good morning, Lucca.

23:44.666 --> 23:45.750
Doctor Jaramillo.

23:46.333 --> 23:51.125
I've got good news. We can afford the trip
to India and receive the treatment.

23:51.666 --> 23:54.291
I await your instructions
on what to do next.

23:54.791 --> 23:55.625
Bárbara…

23:56.125 --> 23:58.500
We're ready for the meeting.
Are you joining us?

24:04.583 --> 24:05.958
How are you, Bárbara?

24:06.041 --> 24:07.708
I talked to my partner, Dr. Kumar,

24:07.791 --> 24:10.875
about your son's case,
and I've got bad news.

24:10.958 --> 24:11.958
For several reasons,

24:12.041 --> 24:15.208
right now we can't use
the Cytotron to treat children.

24:15.291 --> 24:17.708
But I'll let you know when things change.

24:41.875 --> 24:42.916
CYTOTRON DR. KUMAR

24:43.000 --> 24:44.750
We have to make him feel in an environment

24:44.833 --> 24:47.125
that's conducive
to the best possible photo session.

24:47.625 --> 24:49.875
The documents we're reviewing
are in your inbox.

24:49.958 --> 24:50.875
RESEARCH CENTER

24:51.625 --> 24:54.083
The updated version is from the 9th,

24:54.166 --> 24:55.875
because the version from the 5th

24:55.958 --> 24:58.375
doesn't include the changes
we did yesterday.

25:01.666 --> 25:03.000
You got a double six.

25:03.083 --> 25:05.458
That's what I'm saying. Look.

25:46.041 --> 25:48.833
-Not again!
-The ladder let me get here.

25:48.916 --> 25:50.708
How did you do it?

25:50.791 --> 25:51.958
Let me see.

25:56.625 --> 25:58.625
I'm no good at this game.

26:01.916 --> 26:03.000
Doctor Jaramillo.

26:03.500 --> 26:06.833
I know we agreed you'd
call us back when things changed,

26:06.916 --> 26:08.833
but I'd like you to know this treatment

26:08.916 --> 26:11.666
is the first ray of hope for us.

26:12.708 --> 26:14.416
In the world we live in,

26:14.500 --> 26:17.416
everybody thinks Lucca
will never be able to do anything.

26:17.500 --> 26:21.250
That's why it's so important for me
to try out your treatment in India.

26:21.875 --> 26:24.541
Anyways, I'm sorry for this voice message.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.625
We really look forward to your call.

26:26.708 --> 26:28.416
Thank you very much. Namaste.

26:31.666 --> 26:34.000
Doctor, I guess you're very busy,

26:34.083 --> 26:36.500
so you haven't been able
to respond to my messages,

26:36.583 --> 26:40.375
but I'd like to tell you
our situation is still very complicated.

26:40.458 --> 26:43.583
Lucca is getting worse by the day
because he can't eat or move.

26:44.083 --> 26:47.708
And because each epileptic seizure
makes him weaker.

26:47.791 --> 26:52.000
So we'd really like to know how
the permits are progressing over there.

26:52.500 --> 26:54.000
We don't want to be pushy,

26:54.083 --> 26:56.375
but we're really hopeful
about the Cytotron.

26:57.041 --> 26:59.333
We wish you the best this New Year.

27:00.958 --> 27:02.083
Doctor Jaramillo,

27:02.166 --> 27:05.125
it's been nine months
since I first learned about you.

27:05.208 --> 27:07.458
And we are at the hospital again.

27:07.541 --> 27:11.750
We finally decided Lucca
should get a G-button.

27:11.833 --> 27:15.500
And we really don't know
how it will affect his development,

27:15.583 --> 27:18.000
but feeding him is impossible.

27:18.083 --> 27:20.291
And if we don't, he'll die.

27:21.125 --> 27:24.375
I need to talk to you
to find out if the treatment

27:24.458 --> 27:26.666
really is a possibility for Lucca or not.

27:28.000 --> 27:29.166
Thanks a lot, and…

27:29.833 --> 27:31.666
I hope I hear from you soon.

27:32.166 --> 27:33.125
Bye.

27:41.375 --> 27:42.458
Doctor Jaramillo,

27:42.541 --> 27:45.375
I guess you still
don't have good news for us.

27:45.875 --> 27:49.875
But I've continued my research
on the machine and Dr. Kumar's inventions.

27:50.375 --> 27:51.416
And the more I read,

27:51.500 --> 27:54.666
the more convinced I am
that this could change my son's life.

27:56.416 --> 27:58.500
I also met with Bruno Bernardi.

27:58.583 --> 28:01.375
He says that he saw
several children Lucca's age

28:01.458 --> 28:02.833
being treated with the Cytotron.

28:03.333 --> 28:07.458
I don't know if the difficulty in treating
Lucca is the fact that he's a Mexican kid.

28:07.958 --> 28:10.291
But I contacted
the Embassy of Mexico in India.

28:10.875 --> 28:12.500
They're willing to help.

28:12.583 --> 28:17.458
I will do everything I can
to help you travel

28:17.541 --> 28:19.333
to Doctor Kumar’s clinic.

28:19.833 --> 28:21.833
Let me know what else I can do.

28:23.250 --> 28:24.375
I'll do anything.

28:38.041 --> 28:40.208
-Hello?
-Bárbara, it's Doctor Jaramillo.

28:40.291 --> 28:41.625
-Yes.
-Sorry if it's late.

28:41.708 --> 28:45.291
But I'm about to board a plane
and wanted to let you know you did it.

28:45.375 --> 28:48.958
My partner finally accepted
to treat Lucca in the Cytotron.

28:49.458 --> 28:50.625
Can you write this down?

28:50.708 --> 28:53.041
I'll give you the dates and bank details.

28:53.125 --> 28:54.833
Really? I can't believe it.

28:55.458 --> 28:57.583
-Hold on. Monkey, wake up.
-What is it?

28:57.666 --> 28:59.875
You won't believe it.
We're going to India!

28:59.958 --> 29:00.833
Okay.

29:01.333 --> 29:02.916
-Come outside.
-We need to talk.

29:05.458 --> 29:06.333
No.

29:09.458 --> 29:11.458
I don't think it's a good idea, Bárbara.

29:11.541 --> 29:12.416
Why not?

29:16.791 --> 29:18.958
If this thing really worked,

29:19.041 --> 29:21.666
they would've won
the Nobel in Medicine already.

29:21.750 --> 29:25.458
But it’s a very recent discovery.
How can you be sure it doesn’t work?

29:25.541 --> 29:26.750
I can assure you

29:26.833 --> 29:30.125
there is no scientific evidence
that says it does.

29:30.208 --> 29:31.458
It worked for Bernardi.

29:31.958 --> 29:34.708
And it’s on the verge of approval
in the U.S. by the FDA.

29:35.208 --> 29:36.041
Okay, fine.

29:36.541 --> 29:39.458
Let’s say you’re right and I’m wrong.

29:40.125 --> 29:42.583
Nevertheless, a trip to India

29:43.583 --> 29:44.541
for Lucca

29:45.583 --> 29:46.916
is impossible.

29:47.000 --> 29:49.583
-Why impossible?
-Well, where shall I begin?

29:50.291 --> 29:53.125
The right diet for his G-button.

29:53.208 --> 29:56.708
The permits for medicines,
the special chairs.

29:57.291 --> 30:00.375
The risk of an epileptic seizure
on the plane.

30:00.458 --> 30:04.791
Not to mention the diseases
a depressed immune system can catch.

30:05.750 --> 30:07.166
All of that is a threat to his life.

30:08.666 --> 30:09.875
What are you doing?

30:09.958 --> 30:12.708
A list of everything
we need for our trip to India.

30:12.791 --> 30:14.666
I mean, if I get everything you say,

30:14.750 --> 30:17.750
the Valium, the permits,
the diet, the chairs, all of it,

30:17.833 --> 30:18.916
we can do it?

30:21.166 --> 30:24.083
Why do you ask me?
You’ll do it anyway, won’t you?

30:25.666 --> 30:29.041
Well, I also need a disc of his last MRI.

30:29.875 --> 30:31.458
Could you help us with that?

30:32.000 --> 30:34.416
MEXICO
PASSPORT

30:36.458 --> 30:39.375
We continue with the travel arrangements.

30:39.875 --> 30:42.833
We are packing Luqui’s food.

30:42.916 --> 30:47.083
Why are we packing
so many cans and none of my toys?

30:47.166 --> 30:50.125
Because you don’t eat toys.
You're bringing Pipo Rex.

30:50.208 --> 30:53.125
I can eat my other plushies, not Pipo.

30:53.208 --> 30:54.833
Only if I get too hungry.

30:54.916 --> 30:57.333
Let's see, I think
we need another suitcase.

30:57.416 --> 30:58.291
Another one?

30:58.375 --> 31:00.083
We could leave some cans out.

31:00.166 --> 31:02.875
Are you nuts? We can't risk
not finding cans there.

31:02.958 --> 31:04.416
-That's it.
-Nice.

31:20.625 --> 31:23.583
Well, finally,
even though it seemed impossible,

31:24.166 --> 31:25.791
we are flying to India.

31:47.541 --> 31:48.750
Are you ready, Luqui?

31:51.125 --> 31:51.958
Look.

32:25.583 --> 32:27.041
Stop. You might fall, Bruno.

32:27.125 --> 32:29.083
-Okay.
-You did amazing, Luqui.

32:30.375 --> 32:31.958
You're very brave, sweetie.

32:32.041 --> 32:34.541
Soon we'll be boarding another plane.

32:35.083 --> 32:37.333
And we're going to India,
like I promised you.

32:37.833 --> 32:38.750
Andrés!

32:40.541 --> 32:41.541
Two, three…

32:42.333 --> 32:44.125
Four, five, six…

32:46.166 --> 32:47.708
-Eight…
-Turn him sideways.

32:48.625 --> 32:49.750
The oximeter.

32:51.583 --> 32:52.916
Thirteen, fourteen…

32:53.625 --> 32:56.625
Fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,

32:57.125 --> 32:58.958
eighteen, nineteen…

33:11.583 --> 33:13.083
-Andrés?
-Doctor.

33:13.958 --> 33:15.000
Is everything okay?

33:16.458 --> 33:17.291
Sort of.

33:17.375 --> 33:20.125
We're at the Paris airport,
and Lucca had a seizure.

33:20.208 --> 33:21.833
How long did it last?

33:21.916 --> 33:23.708
Six minutes, twenty-seven seconds.

33:23.791 --> 33:27.541
-It was intense, one of the worst.
-How much Valium did you give him?

33:27.625 --> 33:28.958
Two 1-ml doses.

33:29.041 --> 33:31.291
It wouldn't stop.
I thought he needed one more.

33:31.375 --> 33:33.541
Do you think
we should get to the hospital?

33:33.625 --> 33:36.541
If he's admitted,
they won't let you fly for a few days.

33:36.625 --> 33:39.458
And do you think he can fly?
It's over a ten-hour flight.

33:39.541 --> 33:41.500
No, I can't assess that from here.

33:41.583 --> 33:43.583
I warned you it'd be a risky trip.

33:44.250 --> 33:45.083
I know.

33:45.583 --> 33:47.083
But if you choose to fly,

33:47.166 --> 33:49.916
give him a dose of Rivotril before flying

33:50.000 --> 33:52.291
and keep him well hydrated.

33:53.250 --> 33:54.916
Okay. Thanks.

33:55.458 --> 33:56.750
Call me if you need me.

33:57.250 --> 33:59.083
Of course, Doctor. Bye.

34:01.875 --> 34:02.833
What did he say?

34:03.750 --> 34:05.083
He thinks he'll be fine.

34:05.708 --> 34:07.333
So let's relax.

34:32.041 --> 34:33.500
They refused the ambulance.

34:35.125 --> 34:37.500
Yeah, I know. I hope
nothing happens to the child.

34:42.125 --> 34:43.000
I don't know.

34:48.625 --> 34:49.458
Luquita.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.125
We're here, sweetie.

35:42.625 --> 35:43.541
Good job.

35:49.208 --> 35:50.041
Hello.

36:45.166 --> 36:46.208
What's that?

36:46.833 --> 36:50.166
I brought it from the plane
to celebrate we're finally here.

36:50.750 --> 36:51.958
You did it, partner.

36:52.500 --> 36:53.375
Cheers.

36:54.958 --> 36:56.083
We both did.

36:57.666 --> 36:58.791
Well, the five of us.

37:05.458 --> 37:06.583
Cheers, partner.

37:06.666 --> 37:07.541
Cheers.

37:11.166 --> 37:12.125
Yummy.

37:14.416 --> 37:17.041
Hey! You'll finish it. It's tiny.

37:18.958 --> 37:20.416
Well, it's for both of us.

37:21.500 --> 37:22.666
You only brought one?

37:23.750 --> 37:25.041
I might have another one.

37:37.333 --> 37:38.291
Hello!

37:39.416 --> 37:40.416
-Welcome!
-Hi.

37:40.500 --> 37:42.916
-I'm glad you're finally here.
-Thanks.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.041
Hey, Lucca!

37:46.416 --> 37:47.375
Bruno!

37:48.458 --> 37:51.000
You can lick it. It's delicious.

37:51.500 --> 37:52.333
Thanks.

37:53.166 --> 37:55.750
How was your trip?
Is your hotel room comfortable?

37:55.833 --> 37:58.750
The hotel's amazing.
The flight was long and tough.

37:58.833 --> 38:02.041
Yeah, we'd like to have breakfast
before leaving. Is that okay?

38:02.125 --> 38:05.916
Only if it's takeout.
We need to be at the clinic in an hour.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.208
We have to cross
the whole city to get there.

38:10.041 --> 38:10.916
-Well…
-Is that okay?

38:11.000 --> 38:12.625
-Yes, let's go.
-The car's outside.

38:25.166 --> 38:26.666
And the day finally came.

38:27.708 --> 38:29.500
We're on our way
to Lucca's first treatment

38:29.583 --> 38:31.250
at Doctor Kumar's clinic.

39:12.833 --> 39:14.250
And we're here!

39:16.166 --> 39:19.416
Is this the farm
where Lucca will be cured?

39:20.083 --> 39:21.041
It's not a farm.

39:21.125 --> 39:22.500
But there are ducks!

39:28.916 --> 39:31.750
Hey, when are we meeting
the famous Doctor Kumar?

39:31.833 --> 39:34.375
Well, my partner has a very busy schedule.

39:34.458 --> 39:38.291
He's rarely present during treatments,
but don't worry.

39:38.833 --> 39:40.416
You'll be in very good hands.

39:41.958 --> 39:43.000
Come this way.

39:47.500 --> 39:48.666
The damage is here.

39:49.166 --> 39:51.916
The rest of the brain
looks perfectly normal.

39:52.000 --> 39:55.041
But here in this area
is where the lesion is.

39:55.625 --> 39:56.916
It looks like a butterfly.

42:27.541 --> 42:29.791
If you asked me what we're doing here,

42:29.875 --> 42:31.916
I wouldn’t know what to say, Luqui.

42:32.500 --> 42:34.958
But even though I don’t understand
a word they’re saying,

42:35.458 --> 42:38.000
I’m starting to realize
we’ve tried everything.

42:38.083 --> 42:39.750
The only thing left to do

42:39.833 --> 42:43.208
is pray, look upwards, and wait.

43:20.458 --> 43:21.500
Take it, Lucca.

43:30.625 --> 43:32.041
Is everything okay, partner?

43:32.541 --> 43:33.625
My sneakers are gone.

43:33.708 --> 43:34.625
How can that be?

43:35.125 --> 43:35.958
They're gone.

43:36.833 --> 43:38.000
They should be here.

44:01.250 --> 44:02.625
Can I do that?

44:02.708 --> 44:04.500
-No.
-Why not?

44:04.583 --> 44:07.125
If he can do it, why can't I?

44:21.208 --> 44:23.625
I’m right here with you, Luquita.
I'm right here.

44:24.916 --> 44:25.750
Everything okay?

44:35.625 --> 44:37.458
There you go. That's it.

44:44.958 --> 44:47.666
We're almost done
with the first week of treatment.

44:48.666 --> 44:51.041
This is session seven out of twenty-eight.

44:59.916 --> 45:01.708
Are we doing the right thing?

45:02.791 --> 45:04.916
Why do I insist on this treatment

45:05.000 --> 45:08.166
when you've been sick
and anxious for days?

45:09.083 --> 45:11.875
What’s the use
of five people across the world

45:11.958 --> 45:15.041
if all they do is wash towels
and clothes with vomit?

45:26.875 --> 45:27.708
Hello.

45:29.125 --> 45:30.916
Are you spoon-feeding Luqui?

45:32.250 --> 45:34.000
No, he isn’t eating a thing.

45:35.250 --> 45:37.041
-No?
-And he threw up again.

45:37.125 --> 45:38.583
What did you bring me, Mom?

45:39.083 --> 45:40.833
Let’s find out what I brought you.

45:41.958 --> 45:43.208
Look what I brought you.

45:59.958 --> 46:00.958
Are you okay?

46:02.083 --> 46:04.166
Naye, will my tooth fall out soon?

46:04.833 --> 46:05.666
Show me.

46:06.666 --> 46:09.416
-Yeah, it’s pretty loose.
-Look in the drawer.

46:09.500 --> 46:11.916
There's paper and envelopes
with the hotel’s address.

46:12.416 --> 46:15.250
Write a letter to the tooth fairy.
She’ll know where to find you.

46:15.791 --> 46:16.791
Come on, let’s go.

46:18.583 --> 46:19.625
What?

46:21.833 --> 46:23.916
Monkey, I’m very worried about Lucca.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.416
This isn't working.

46:26.041 --> 46:27.166
We’ve been scammed.

46:27.708 --> 46:30.250
I mean, did you see the place?
It’s… it's a farm.

46:30.333 --> 46:32.625
And what's with the machine?
It’s just a tube.

46:32.708 --> 46:35.250
They made an idiot out of me.
I brought you all the way to India.

46:35.333 --> 46:36.708
It's too soon to tell.

46:36.791 --> 46:39.666
But, Monkey, do you see any difference?

46:39.750 --> 46:41.291
Something? Anything?

46:41.875 --> 46:43.250
We need to wait.

46:43.333 --> 46:44.708
It’s not like this is magic.

46:47.541 --> 46:49.000
What if we made a mistake?

46:50.583 --> 46:51.958
Would you do something for me?

46:53.708 --> 46:54.750
Go to bed.

46:55.791 --> 46:57.333
Stop thinking for today, Monkey.

46:57.833 --> 46:58.666
Okay?

46:59.416 --> 47:00.833
-Go.
-Okay.

47:26.333 --> 47:27.583
Luqui!

47:28.291 --> 47:29.333
Luquita?

47:30.708 --> 47:31.833
Are you okay?

47:32.541 --> 47:33.375
Bruno!

47:33.458 --> 47:34.916
Hey, Lucca.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.541
-My tooth fell out.
-Go get your parents!

47:38.750 --> 47:40.166
Luquita!

48:01.583 --> 48:03.791
I lost my tooth!

48:03.875 --> 48:04.958
Oh no, let me see.

48:05.041 --> 48:06.541
I’ll help you find it.

48:27.500 --> 48:29.291
Everything will be fine. Don't worry.

48:46.750 --> 48:47.750
I'm sorry, Luqui.

48:49.291 --> 48:51.166
Sorry for bringing you all this way.

48:54.250 --> 48:56.416
I thought it would help you, sweetie.

48:56.916 --> 48:59.458
I swear it’s been
quite an adventure for him.

49:04.375 --> 49:05.791
What if he dies, Andrés?

49:09.166 --> 49:11.791
It’s been a possibility
since the day he was born.

49:12.291 --> 49:13.416
Yet here we are.

49:18.666 --> 49:19.750
This is unbearable.

49:43.166 --> 49:45.375
I wish I could run away from here, Luqui.

49:46.250 --> 49:49.500
I wish we could fly away
through a hospital window.

49:50.250 --> 49:53.625
To forget for a second this fear
of something bad happening to you.

49:54.875 --> 49:58.500
This throbbing anguish in my chest
since the day you were born.

50:04.583 --> 50:06.291
Bruno!

50:06.791 --> 50:07.625
It's this way.

50:13.125 --> 50:14.291
-Hi, Mom!
-Hi.

50:15.375 --> 50:16.208
How are you?

50:16.291 --> 50:17.250
-Fine.
-Fine?

50:20.708 --> 50:22.500
I want to show Lucca something.

50:22.583 --> 50:25.541
Fine, but no shouting, okay?
Your brother is resting.

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
How was it?

50:28.083 --> 50:30.208
Fine, what about you? How did you sleep?

50:30.791 --> 50:31.791
Terrible.

50:31.875 --> 50:32.791
I barely slept.

50:32.875 --> 50:34.333
-Really?
-Not a wink.

50:34.416 --> 50:35.541
Lucca…

50:36.291 --> 50:37.166
Lucca.

50:39.083 --> 50:41.250
My tooth finally fell out, look.

50:42.291 --> 50:44.000
See? I've got it here.

50:45.333 --> 50:48.583
They told me the tooth fairy
doesn’t come to India.

50:48.666 --> 50:49.833
Do you know who does?

50:51.000 --> 50:52.791
-A tiger!
-Bruno…

50:56.458 --> 50:59.250
How old were you
when your first tooth fell out?

50:59.958 --> 51:01.958
Naye says I was early.

51:06.500 --> 51:07.333
What is it?

51:10.166 --> 51:11.500
I don’t understand you.

51:13.166 --> 51:15.375
Oh, you want to try my lollipop.

51:15.875 --> 51:16.708
Hold on.

51:19.291 --> 51:21.291
Naye doesn’t know I brought it.

51:26.250 --> 51:27.625
No. What are you doing?

51:29.916 --> 51:32.833
Lucca wanted to try my lollipop.

51:32.916 --> 51:34.041
He's sucking it.

51:34.625 --> 51:36.583
-He's never done that before.
-No.

51:37.666 --> 51:38.500
Lucca.

51:45.166 --> 51:46.000
Lucca.

51:48.666 --> 51:49.916
Come on, suck it.

51:52.458 --> 51:54.708
That’s it, sweetie. Good job, Luqui.

51:58.166 --> 51:59.083
Good job.

52:01.750 --> 52:04.208
Okay, this one captures you here.

52:04.291 --> 52:06.041
But that one captures you there.

52:06.833 --> 52:07.708
-Andrés!
-What?

52:08.666 --> 52:11.250
-Andrés, come here!
-What? What's wrong?

52:12.125 --> 52:14.375
-Is something wrong?
-Look at him! Take a video.

52:15.500 --> 52:16.333
Ready.

52:16.416 --> 52:20.250
This is the first time Lucca grabs
with both hands and holds on.

52:20.333 --> 52:23.416
Before, he'd grab with one hand
and let go of the other right away.

52:23.500 --> 52:25.250
But since water is lighter,

52:25.833 --> 52:27.125
it helps him hold on.

52:27.208 --> 52:28.625
Very good, Luquita!

52:28.708 --> 52:32.166
-Lucca, is bath time over?
-He can stay upright.

52:32.250 --> 52:34.166
-Great!
-Can I get in?

52:34.791 --> 52:36.125
Why are you shouting?

53:43.750 --> 53:45.708
Luqui, sweetie.

53:46.625 --> 53:48.083
You’ve been born again.

53:50.750 --> 53:52.375
The day of your first birth,

53:52.458 --> 53:54.625
we were so excited about the future.

53:55.125 --> 53:59.125
Not knowing that everything would turn out
the opposite of what we expected.

54:00.000 --> 54:01.625
You didn’t cry at birth.

54:02.583 --> 54:04.291
I didn’t hold you in my arms.

54:05.666 --> 54:08.708
You didn’t look me in the eye.
And I couldn’t even feed you.

54:12.208 --> 54:15.208
Doctors warned us to get used to it.

54:15.708 --> 54:18.500
They said you would never
be able to speak or walk.

54:18.583 --> 54:19.458
You can do it.

54:19.541 --> 54:21.250
That you’d never call me "Mom."

54:24.083 --> 54:25.291
-That's it!
-Yeah!

54:27.708 --> 54:29.375
But look at us now, Luqui.

54:30.833 --> 54:32.750
None of them would believe it.

54:33.541 --> 54:35.333
And I'll do everything in my power

54:35.416 --> 54:37.708
so you don’t miss any other chance.

54:37.791 --> 54:39.583
Okay now, be strong.

54:39.666 --> 54:41.333
That day, I didn’t know how to push.

54:42.291 --> 54:46.458
But since then, I’ve learned
to cross oceans and move mountains.

54:47.375 --> 54:48.833
You’ve taught me that.

54:48.916 --> 54:49.875
That's it!

54:49.958 --> 54:51.791
That's it! Bravo!

54:52.416 --> 54:53.916
That's it, sweetie!

55:18.541 --> 55:19.666
Good job, sweetie!

55:21.041 --> 55:21.875
Come on!

55:22.916 --> 55:23.875
Cheers.

56:08.541 --> 56:10.708
Andrés, could you take care of the bill?

56:10.791 --> 56:13.333
I have to give John and Kumar a ride.

56:13.416 --> 56:14.750
And it's getting late.

56:21.541 --> 56:22.375
Thank you.

56:27.500 --> 56:28.333
Thank you.

56:36.333 --> 56:37.166
Good night.

56:49.125 --> 56:50.000
Monkey…

56:53.375 --> 56:54.583
I didn't get the job.

56:56.333 --> 56:58.583
What? The one you were sure you'd get?

57:09.250 --> 57:10.500
A cow on the road!

57:10.583 --> 57:14.250
All right, let’s do a roll call
for our last session with Kumar.

57:17.833 --> 57:19.083
Dad?

57:27.458 --> 57:29.541
Luqui, you're awake!

57:31.583 --> 57:33.625
Da-ddy. Right?

57:34.375 --> 57:35.875
Daddy.

57:45.333 --> 57:46.208
Da-ddy.

57:47.291 --> 57:48.125
Da-ddy.

57:49.125 --> 57:50.208
Da-ddy.

58:54.708 --> 58:55.958
What did you say, Luquita?

58:56.958 --> 58:58.583
-Say it.
-Again, say Kumar. Kumar.

58:58.666 --> 59:00.250
-You can do it.
-Kumar.

59:00.333 --> 59:02.750
-Say it. Say Kumar.
-Say Kumar.

59:02.833 --> 59:04.333
He only listens to you.

59:16.833 --> 59:18.208
I can’t believe it!

59:33.166 --> 59:34.083
One more time.

01:00:05.333 --> 01:00:07.458
You want to come back, right, Luqui?

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:43.125
Let's go!

01:01:10.916 --> 01:01:11.750
There you go.

01:01:21.125 --> 01:01:23.041
Kumar is happy with Lucca.

01:01:23.125 --> 01:01:26.875
It'll help the Cytotron reach
more children around the world.

01:01:26.958 --> 01:01:29.750
-So thank you very much for your effort.
-No, thank you, really.

01:01:29.833 --> 01:01:30.958
We’re very happy.

01:01:31.041 --> 01:01:34.750
In fact, Kumar told us
Lucca will need more treatments.

01:01:35.750 --> 01:01:37.958
Is it true you’re opening
a clinic in Baltimore?

01:01:38.458 --> 01:01:41.541
Well, we’re waiting for FDA authorization

01:01:41.625 --> 01:01:46.500
to start clinical trials in the U.S.,
but that will take a few years.

01:01:47.375 --> 01:01:49.666
Have you ever thought
of conducting them in Mexico?

01:01:50.166 --> 01:01:53.041
John Millar said there are
two Cytotrons stuck in Veracruz.

01:01:53.125 --> 01:01:55.083
John Millar signed an NDA.

01:01:55.583 --> 01:01:57.250
He should be more discreet.

01:01:57.333 --> 01:01:58.875
Just so you know,

01:01:58.958 --> 01:02:01.250
Mexico is more complex than the U.S.

01:02:01.333 --> 01:02:03.291
The bureaucracy, different agendas…

01:02:03.375 --> 01:02:04.833
I mean it, forget about it.

01:02:04.916 --> 01:02:08.333
But how can this exist
and not be available to everybody?

01:02:08.416 --> 01:02:10.708
Let me help you
with the permits in Mexico.

01:02:11.208 --> 01:02:14.041
With Lucca’s case,
your testimony, and some allies.

01:02:14.125 --> 01:02:16.333
We could talk with Kumar and tell him--

01:02:16.416 --> 01:02:17.541
No, hold on.

01:02:17.625 --> 01:02:20.750
Kumar has always made clear to me
that he’s not interested

01:02:20.833 --> 01:02:22.541
in licensing bureaucracy.

01:02:22.625 --> 01:02:26.583
Anything you want to discuss
with Kumar goes through me.

01:02:27.375 --> 01:02:28.458
If you’ll excuse me,

01:02:28.541 --> 01:02:30.625
I think my plane
leaves earlier than yours.

01:02:30.708 --> 01:02:31.750
But we’ll be in touch.

01:02:32.250 --> 01:02:33.375
-See you.
-Have a good trip.

01:02:33.458 --> 01:02:34.458
Bye!

01:02:35.375 --> 01:02:36.666
Bye!

01:02:37.291 --> 01:02:38.291
Strange, right?

01:02:38.375 --> 01:02:39.208
Very strange.

01:02:39.708 --> 01:02:41.833
I mean, it’s his business,
but I don't know.

01:02:42.333 --> 01:02:43.250
He's strange.

01:03:07.333 --> 01:03:08.250
Kumar!

01:03:09.416 --> 01:03:10.708
Can't you say "Daddy"?

01:03:11.208 --> 01:03:14.500
How many of your diapers
has Kumar changed? How many?

01:03:20.166 --> 01:03:22.500
Mom, I forgot Pipo Rex.

01:03:22.583 --> 01:03:25.041
It’s okay, honey. We’ll buy another one.

01:03:25.541 --> 01:03:28.541
You can’t buy friends.

01:03:32.250 --> 01:03:35.208
Don’t laugh, Lucca.

01:03:55.583 --> 01:03:57.333
Good morning, sunshine.

01:03:58.375 --> 01:03:59.708
Doctor Jaramillo,

01:03:59.791 --> 01:04:02.208
I hope you had a good flight back home.

01:04:02.875 --> 01:04:05.083
Frankly, I haven’t slept much.

01:04:05.583 --> 01:04:07.833
Since our last talk at the airport,

01:04:07.916 --> 01:04:11.000
I’ve been thinking about ways
to help you get the permit

01:04:11.083 --> 01:04:14.166
for clinical trials
for the Cytotron in Mexico.

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:18.125
Maybe I could start
with Lucca’s neurologist.

01:04:33.791 --> 01:04:36.125
-This is crazy, Bárbara.
-What?

01:04:36.208 --> 01:04:37.375
I'll show you

01:04:37.958 --> 01:04:40.791
one of Lucca’s MRIs from last year

01:04:40.875 --> 01:04:43.541
so you can compare
the number of brain connections

01:04:43.625 --> 01:04:45.583
he used to have with the current ones.

01:04:54.625 --> 01:04:56.458
Look at the difference here.

01:04:57.583 --> 01:04:58.416
Wow!

01:05:00.083 --> 01:05:02.958
It’s… very impressive.

01:05:03.041 --> 01:05:05.375
I don’t get how they did that in a month.

01:05:07.583 --> 01:05:08.500
So what's next?

01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.875
Can they keep treating him?

01:05:11.583 --> 01:05:12.916
Well, that’s the plan.

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.208
But there’s no chance
we can afford another trip like that.

01:05:17.333 --> 01:05:19.000
Take a look from this angle.

01:05:22.250 --> 01:05:24.791
Would this hospital be interested
in conducting the trials?

01:05:25.583 --> 01:05:28.000
Just imagine. If we bring
the clinical trial protocol,

01:05:28.083 --> 01:05:30.916
we could continue treating
Lucca and many other children.

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.000
No way!

01:05:32.583 --> 01:05:35.000
Convincing the old people
on the Committee Board

01:05:35.083 --> 01:05:36.916
is like trying to move a mountain.

01:05:37.625 --> 01:05:40.958
José, this could save
the lives of thousands of children.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.125
Are you happy to come back to school?

01:05:49.708 --> 01:05:51.875
-Good morning, ma'am.
-Hi. Good morning.

01:05:54.166 --> 01:05:56.166
What’s wrong, sweetie? What is it?

01:05:57.875 --> 01:05:59.916
Shall we go? No?

01:06:01.375 --> 01:06:03.041
Why are you crying?

01:06:12.208 --> 01:06:13.166
Oh no!

01:06:16.708 --> 01:06:19.458
THE NEW MEXICAN MIRACLES

01:06:40.958 --> 01:06:42.208
Good night, Monkey.

01:06:43.500 --> 01:06:44.458
Monkey.

01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:49.875
I've been thinking.

01:06:50.708 --> 01:06:51.583
And…

01:06:54.375 --> 01:06:55.708
Are you listening to me?

01:06:56.791 --> 01:06:59.625
“You've been thinking,”
as in I have to worry?

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:06.958
If what we’re trying to do
at the Children’s Hospital doesn’t work,

01:07:08.291 --> 01:07:10.750
we could sell the apartment
and go back to India.

01:07:14.416 --> 01:07:16.541
Excuse me for saying this,
but are you serious?

01:07:17.666 --> 01:07:19.583
We've been back for less than a month.

01:07:20.375 --> 01:07:21.875
Lucca is better than ever.

01:07:21.958 --> 01:07:23.583
I'm still unemployed.

01:07:23.666 --> 01:07:26.875
And you’re considering selling
the apartment to go back to India?

01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:29.416
-I’m thinking of Lucca.
-Exactly.

01:07:30.833 --> 01:07:32.916
Maybe you should think
about the rest of us too.

01:07:33.416 --> 01:07:35.041
About yourself, about everybody.

01:07:35.125 --> 01:07:37.916
-But--
-No. I swear, I’m exhausted.

01:07:39.666 --> 01:07:40.541
Good night.

01:07:49.333 --> 01:07:50.166
Hello.

01:07:50.250 --> 01:07:52.041
Bárbara, did you call me?

01:07:52.125 --> 01:07:53.750
I've got missing calls from you.

01:07:53.833 --> 01:07:55.666
Yeah, I’ve got great news for you.

01:07:56.166 --> 01:08:00.416
Lucca’s neurologist is proposing
the Committee of the Children’s Hospital

01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:02.958
to conduct the clinical trials
with the Cytotron there.

01:08:03.041 --> 01:08:06.541
Look, I understand you want
the machine to be in Mexico.

01:08:06.625 --> 01:08:09.291
But for both Kumar and me,

01:08:09.375 --> 01:08:12.791
the priority is to get FDA approval.

01:08:12.875 --> 01:08:15.083
That can happen simultaneously.

01:08:15.625 --> 01:08:19.166
I’m sure Kumar would love it.
I can write to him and tell him--

01:08:19.250 --> 01:08:21.416
Bárbara, let’s make something clear.

01:08:21.916 --> 01:08:25.083
Nothing gets to Kumar
without going through me first.

01:08:25.166 --> 01:08:27.791
It’s been hard enough to get where we are

01:08:27.875 --> 01:08:30.416
in regard to the international
licensing negotiations.

01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:33.083
-I don't want anything to interfere.
-Barbie, do you have a sec?

01:08:33.166 --> 01:08:34.083
-Please.
-Yes.

01:08:34.583 --> 01:08:36.083
I have to go. I’ll call you later.

01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:43.000
You know I’ve had your back
since the Lucca thing happened to you.

01:08:44.291 --> 01:08:46.208
Since the Lucca thing happened to me?

01:08:46.791 --> 01:08:49.458
-You make it sound horrible.
-I'm sorry. No.

01:08:49.541 --> 01:08:51.166
What I mean is,

01:08:51.750 --> 01:08:55.583
maybe it’s time
to reconsider your priorities.

01:08:56.083 --> 01:08:59.166
-I feel--
-You know how long I've been working here?

01:08:59.250 --> 01:09:00.125
Fifteen years?

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:03.041
You’ve only been here for a third of that.

01:09:04.125 --> 01:09:06.166
Besides, the magazine
hasn’t stopped growing.

01:09:06.666 --> 01:09:08.791
So it doesn’t matter
how much time I spend here.

01:09:08.875 --> 01:09:12.208
Maybe it does.
Maybe your performance isn't the same.

01:09:12.291 --> 01:09:16.250
You’re too invested in your son.
And I need you fully invested here.

01:09:17.708 --> 01:09:18.541
Wow.

01:09:19.583 --> 01:09:24.041
And I'm very sorry to tell you,
but we're looking for your replacement.

01:10:32.708 --> 01:10:34.291
Can I sleep here tonight?

01:10:34.875 --> 01:10:36.666
I miss Pipo.

01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:55.875
Andrés, he’s having a seizure.

01:10:55.958 --> 01:10:59.583
Seventeen, eighteen, nineteen…

01:11:00.208 --> 01:11:01.541
Easy.

01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:02.541
Relax.

01:11:02.625 --> 01:11:05.833
Twenty-three, twenty-four, twenty-five.

01:11:09.916 --> 01:11:11.208
Twenty-five seconds.

01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.125
It was a short one.

01:11:15.541 --> 01:11:18.541
Well, all in all, there’s good news.

01:11:19.625 --> 01:11:22.708
There are considerably
fewer epileptic signs now.

01:11:22.791 --> 01:11:25.208
In contrast with his last EEG,

01:11:26.125 --> 01:11:28.500
they decreased 70 percent. Look.

01:11:29.375 --> 01:11:32.083
But with the remaining 30 percent,

01:11:32.166 --> 01:11:34.541
he could have
another seizure like yesterday’s.

01:11:34.625 --> 01:11:38.250
If he keeps experiencing them,
we could lose all progress.

01:11:38.333 --> 01:11:40.500
It depends on the seizure’s intensity,

01:11:41.125 --> 01:11:42.000
but yes.

01:11:43.708 --> 01:11:46.625
What did the Committee say
about conducting clinical trials here?

01:11:46.708 --> 01:11:48.708
They’re open to the possibility.

01:11:49.708 --> 01:11:51.125
But before we go there,

01:11:51.208 --> 01:11:55.291
the hospital is still unsure
about the treatment.

01:11:55.375 --> 01:11:58.666
We need to back up
the proposal with other cases,

01:11:58.750 --> 01:12:00.041
other than Lucca’s.

01:12:00.125 --> 01:12:02.750
Let’s ask Kumar. I’m sure he’d help us.

01:12:03.333 --> 01:12:05.291
In fact, I’ll give you his number

01:12:05.375 --> 01:12:08.291
for you to ask him
for the information officially.

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:10.541
It’s not that easy, Bárbara.

01:12:11.250 --> 01:12:14.125
Every institute has
its own privacy criteria.

01:12:14.708 --> 01:12:15.625
Please.

01:12:15.708 --> 01:12:17.083
At least try.

01:12:40.416 --> 01:12:41.458
Hello.

01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:43.791
I didn’t know you were in Mexico.

01:12:43.875 --> 01:12:45.000
Can we talk?

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:47.166
What is it? Is something wrong?

01:12:47.833 --> 01:12:50.375
Why did Lucca’s neurologist call Kumar?

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:53.041
I don't know.

01:12:55.875 --> 01:12:56.875
Be honest.

01:12:57.416 --> 01:12:58.833
Did you connect them?

01:13:00.250 --> 01:13:01.083
No.

01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:05.791
I spoke with Kumar.

01:13:06.625 --> 01:13:09.208
He’s very upset, Bárbara.

01:13:09.291 --> 01:13:11.000
-Really upset.
-But why?

01:13:11.083 --> 01:13:13.750
We had an agreement, and you broke it.

01:13:13.833 --> 01:13:16.000
You have now idea
how much damage you caused.

01:13:16.083 --> 01:13:17.791
Kumar is furious.

01:13:17.875 --> 01:13:19.583
He wrote me a very aggressive email

01:13:19.666 --> 01:13:22.666
because he thinks Ibarra
is a spy from the Mexican government.

01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:24.250
A spy?

01:13:24.333 --> 01:13:28.791
The Cytotron project
in Mexico is over because of you.

01:13:28.875 --> 01:13:30.125
-But--
-But nothing!

01:13:30.208 --> 01:13:32.583
The Cytotron is over for Lucca.

01:13:32.666 --> 01:13:35.916
It’s over in the U.S.
as well as in Mexico.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.750
It’s over in India.

01:13:37.833 --> 01:13:39.916
It's over! All because of you.

01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:41.500
But I only wanted to help.

01:13:41.583 --> 01:13:42.458
No.

01:13:42.541 --> 01:13:44.166
You're selfish.

01:13:44.250 --> 01:13:47.375
You ruined years of work by many people.

01:13:47.458 --> 01:13:51.875
And you took away from millions of kids
the possibility of accessing treatment.

01:13:51.958 --> 01:13:55.375
Imagine how many children
will die of epilepsy because of you.

01:13:56.166 --> 01:13:57.291
Just imagine.

01:14:09.083 --> 01:14:11.375
You have no idea
why I’m crying. Do you, Lucca?

01:14:13.333 --> 01:14:14.708
I screwed up again.

01:14:16.916 --> 01:14:18.166
It was my fault.

01:14:19.041 --> 01:14:22.125
I desperately wanted to bring
the Cytotron to Mexico.

01:14:22.708 --> 01:14:24.333
And now we won’t have it.

01:14:29.458 --> 01:14:30.625
Can I get in?

01:14:31.208 --> 01:14:33.083
No, Bruno. Bath time is over.

01:14:38.041 --> 01:14:39.166
What did you pour in, Bruno?

01:14:39.250 --> 01:14:40.583
A magic potion

01:14:40.666 --> 01:14:43.833
that will make you strong like dinosaurs.

01:14:43.916 --> 01:14:45.916
This is the last thing I needed today!

01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.791
No, Barbs! Take a shower,
I’ll take care of Lucca.

01:14:48.875 --> 01:14:52.291
-But they'll get stronger.
-Get me some rags from the kitchen.

01:14:52.375 --> 01:14:54.500
We’d be lost without you, Naye.

01:14:55.083 --> 01:14:56.833
No, it's okay.

01:14:56.916 --> 01:15:00.500
I’d be lost without you too.
Right, Luquita?

01:15:19.416 --> 01:15:23.000
All I wanted was
for Lucca to have an easier life.

01:15:24.500 --> 01:15:26.750
Maybe Lucca’s life would be easier

01:15:26.833 --> 01:15:30.583
if he wasn't constantly chasing
something he can’t get.

01:15:30.666 --> 01:15:32.750
If he had a chance to be who he is.

01:15:34.250 --> 01:15:35.916
The person he was meant to be.

01:15:36.416 --> 01:15:39.125
And just let our son give up? No.

01:15:40.250 --> 01:15:42.291
No, I won’t stop fighting for him.

01:15:42.791 --> 01:15:45.041
What’s with fighting all the time?

01:15:47.708 --> 01:15:49.333
It’s okay to give up, Bárbara.

01:15:50.541 --> 01:15:52.125
It's okay to surrender.

01:15:54.625 --> 01:15:57.541
I totally understand
you want the best for Lucca.

01:15:58.083 --> 01:15:59.041
So do I.

01:16:01.708 --> 01:16:02.750
But not like this.

01:16:03.250 --> 01:16:04.291
What do you mean?

01:16:05.708 --> 01:16:07.458
I owe it to him.

01:16:09.250 --> 01:16:11.458
And the least I can do is try everything

01:16:11.958 --> 01:16:13.500
so he has a better life.

01:16:13.583 --> 01:16:15.958
We've already discussed this.
You don't owe him anything.

01:16:16.041 --> 01:16:18.208
I feel responsible for his condition.

01:16:18.291 --> 01:16:19.583
You shouldn't.

01:16:21.875 --> 01:16:24.208
You're responsible for Lucca's condition

01:16:24.291 --> 01:16:27.000
as much as my mom is
for what happened to my leg.

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:28.791
No, Monkey. That was an accident.

01:16:28.875 --> 01:16:30.041
Same with Lucca.

01:16:30.125 --> 01:16:32.375
No. I had to push one more time.

01:16:32.458 --> 01:16:33.416
And I didn't.

01:16:33.500 --> 01:16:36.500
I don't know why, but I couldn't do it.

01:16:36.583 --> 01:16:38.833
How would you have pushed
if you passed out?

01:16:38.916 --> 01:16:40.416
No, I didn't.

01:16:40.500 --> 01:16:44.708
I distinctly remember I saw sparks
and felt the doctors pulling him out.

01:16:44.791 --> 01:16:46.250
I don't know, but…

01:16:47.041 --> 01:16:50.541
At some point,
they put an oxygen mask on you.

01:16:51.416 --> 01:16:52.583
An oxygen mask?

01:16:55.166 --> 01:16:56.000
Why?

01:16:58.333 --> 01:16:59.708
EL REFUGIO HOSPITAL

01:17:00.666 --> 01:17:01.541
Good afternoon.

01:17:01.625 --> 01:17:03.958
I'm looking for Doctor Flores Delgado.

01:17:04.458 --> 01:17:05.291
Just a second.

01:17:23.208 --> 01:17:24.041
Nancy.

01:17:24.541 --> 01:17:26.958
Help me with this report, please.

01:17:28.666 --> 01:17:29.583
Thanks.

01:17:32.125 --> 01:17:35.708
Yours was the most difficult
delivery I've ever tended.

01:17:36.375 --> 01:17:39.041
It was a rushed delivery.

01:17:40.541 --> 01:17:42.500
The back-to-back contractions

01:17:42.583 --> 01:17:45.375
affected your baby's heart rate and…

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.791
When we gave you the epidural,

01:17:48.291 --> 01:17:50.166
something happened.

01:17:51.125 --> 01:17:53.458
It's not very common,
but it happens sometimes.

01:17:55.208 --> 01:17:58.333
The anesthesia went upwards and…

01:18:01.458 --> 01:18:02.875
paralyzed your diaphragm.

01:18:03.458 --> 01:18:04.375
And we…

01:18:04.875 --> 01:18:09.416
Well, maybe we could have…
made a different decision.

01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:12.083
But we did what we thought was right.

01:18:14.458 --> 01:18:15.833
That's why I couldn't push.

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:17.333
Push?

01:18:18.083 --> 01:18:20.708
Bárbara, you went into respiratory arrest.

01:18:22.791 --> 01:18:24.166
It's a miracle you survived.

01:18:27.666 --> 01:18:30.541
And we pulled
your son out as best we could.

01:18:30.625 --> 01:18:31.458
Really.

01:18:32.583 --> 01:18:35.291
It was a miracle the two of you survived.

01:18:53.708 --> 01:18:54.541
Monkey.

01:18:55.958 --> 01:18:56.958
Is everything okay?

01:18:58.333 --> 01:18:59.291
Where were you?

01:19:01.916 --> 01:19:04.208
I visited the hospital
where Lucca was born.

01:19:04.291 --> 01:19:06.416
I spoke with the doctor who delivered him.

01:19:06.916 --> 01:19:08.125
Really?

01:19:08.208 --> 01:19:09.125
What for?

01:19:09.208 --> 01:19:12.625
I needed to understand
what happened that day and…

01:19:13.625 --> 01:19:17.208
The doctor explained
that I went into respiratory arrest.

01:19:17.291 --> 01:19:19.791
Lucca and I nearly died.

01:19:20.666 --> 01:19:23.541
I mean, it's a miracle we are here today.

01:19:26.875 --> 01:19:28.625
We are very lucky, Monkey.

01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:30.083
Mom!

01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:33.416
-Yes, sweetie?
-I've got a surprise for you.

01:19:34.166 --> 01:19:36.625
But you need to close your eyes.

01:19:36.708 --> 01:19:37.958
-Okay.
-Come on.

01:19:38.041 --> 01:19:38.875
Let's go.

01:19:39.583 --> 01:19:40.875
Not you, just her.

01:19:45.750 --> 01:19:47.375
You can open them.

01:19:47.458 --> 01:19:48.875
Ta-da!

01:19:49.625 --> 01:19:53.083
Now they're dinosaurs,
just like you and Lucca.

01:19:55.875 --> 01:19:58.291
I love them, sweetie!

01:19:58.791 --> 01:19:59.958
Hello, Diana.

01:20:00.041 --> 01:20:00.916
Hi.

01:20:01.416 --> 01:20:03.125
-Hello.
-We're here.

01:20:03.875 --> 01:20:05.791
We're happy to welcome Lucca.

01:20:06.291 --> 01:20:08.416
You're introducing him
to all of your friends.

01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:09.541
-Right, Bruno?
-Yes.

01:20:09.625 --> 01:20:11.041
That is Diego.

01:20:11.125 --> 01:20:12.333
That is Moisés.

01:20:12.416 --> 01:20:13.333
That is Emilia.

01:20:13.416 --> 01:20:15.333
She's not nice and we don't like her.

01:20:15.416 --> 01:20:17.291
You have to go now.

01:20:17.833 --> 01:20:19.625
Call me if you need me
and I'll be right over.

01:20:19.708 --> 01:20:22.541
Yeah. We'll be okay, don't worry.
Right, Lucca?

01:20:22.625 --> 01:20:24.041
Are you excited, Luqui?

01:20:25.791 --> 01:20:27.416
All right, I love you. Have fun.

01:20:42.708 --> 01:20:43.708
He is Lucca.

01:22:05.708 --> 01:22:07.833
WHAT IS TRUE

01:22:09.333 --> 01:22:13.041
WHAT ISN'T TRUE

01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:23.166
THERE IS NO CLINIC AT JOHNS HOPKINS

01:22:23.250 --> 01:22:26.458
My foundation gave him
more than a million dollars

01:22:26.541 --> 01:22:28.416
for his center in The States, you know?

01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:31.000
-At Johns Hopkins Hospital?
-Yeah, exactly.

01:22:31.666 --> 01:22:33.250
We introduced him to many people.

01:22:33.333 --> 01:22:35.833
And he asked everyone for money.

01:22:36.333 --> 01:22:40.583
And when my mother-in-law
became ill, he promised to take her there.

01:22:40.666 --> 01:22:42.333
But the wretch never did.

01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:46.291
Not only that,
but when we wanted a copy of the patent,

01:22:46.375 --> 01:22:50.333
we learned that the Cytotron
is registered as Jaramillo's invention.

01:22:50.833 --> 01:22:52.250
And so is the treatment.

01:22:52.333 --> 01:22:56.458
Then we sent Kumar a copy, and he said,
"Impossible, that machine is mine."

01:22:57.208 --> 01:22:59.875
It's impressive.
Do you remember how you found out?

01:22:59.958 --> 01:23:01.458
Well, sort of by chance, really.

01:23:01.541 --> 01:23:03.541
HE REGISTERED CYTOTRON'S PATENT
IN HIS OWN NAME

01:23:03.625 --> 01:23:07.583
But then we got to see the registry
and realized it was in Jaramillo's name…

01:23:09.583 --> 01:23:13.041
There were more than 50 people.
Among them, several top businessmen…

01:23:13.125 --> 01:23:16.125
WHAT IS NOT TRUE

01:23:16.208 --> 01:23:18.916
All the alumni know each other…

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:21.166
HE NEVER STUDIED AT HARVARD!!

01:23:21.250 --> 01:23:25.000
THE CYTOTRON SOFTWARE
WAS NOT HIS INVENTION

01:23:25.833 --> 01:23:28.125
As you can imagine,

01:23:28.208 --> 01:23:30.333
learning all this

01:23:30.416 --> 01:23:33.208
was very disconcerting to me.

01:23:33.916 --> 01:23:37.000
And even more so because it's my son

01:23:37.083 --> 01:23:38.333
who's at stake.

01:23:38.833 --> 01:23:41.083
I can't give up.

01:23:41.166 --> 01:23:44.250
-Because his future is in my hands--
-Monkey.

01:23:44.333 --> 01:23:47.083
You sure you don't you want to come
to bed and continue tomorrow?

01:23:47.166 --> 01:23:48.583
When Jaramillo gets this email,

01:23:48.666 --> 01:23:50.916
he'll have to accept
that we use his machines.

01:23:52.125 --> 01:23:54.583
I swear I don't understand
why he isn't in jail.

01:23:55.083 --> 01:23:57.083
He knows how to navigate the legal system.

01:23:57.166 --> 01:23:59.875
The jerk won't get away
with it this time.

01:23:59.958 --> 01:24:03.041
I'll send this to Kumar
and all the investors. He'll see.

01:24:03.625 --> 01:24:04.791
In addition…

01:24:10.000 --> 01:24:11.916
The ducks are cute, aren't they?

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:12.833
Lucca?

01:24:14.083 --> 01:24:15.958
Shall we get ahead of them?

01:24:16.041 --> 01:24:18.291
-We'll beat you!
-Careful.

01:24:19.041 --> 01:24:20.916
Hold it firmly. Don't turn back.

01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:22.375
Right, Luqui?

01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:25.208
-Here we come!
-Very good.

01:24:26.125 --> 01:24:28.125
No. Keep your eyes straight ahead.

01:24:28.208 --> 01:24:29.375
Here we come!

01:24:29.458 --> 01:24:30.958
We caught up with them!

01:24:31.041 --> 01:24:33.041
Hey, wait for me!

01:24:33.833 --> 01:24:35.208
Good job, Luqui.

01:24:35.916 --> 01:24:37.125
Good job.

01:24:37.916 --> 01:24:40.541
We beat them. We are the champions.

01:24:42.458 --> 01:24:43.375
Just you.

01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:54.916
Please, listen to this.

01:24:55.416 --> 01:24:56.541
What?

01:24:57.583 --> 01:24:58.791
Bárbara, you won't believe it.

01:24:58.875 --> 01:25:01.708
We have an appointment
with the Secretary of Health.

01:25:01.791 --> 01:25:03.541
It seems your email worked.

01:25:03.625 --> 01:25:07.208
Jaramillo agreed to let us use
the machines for the clinical trials.

01:25:07.291 --> 01:25:10.625
We are a few days away
from getting the COFEPRIS permit.

01:25:10.708 --> 01:25:11.750
Come with Lucca.

01:25:13.791 --> 01:25:15.291
-Please, come in.
-Thanks.

01:25:19.083 --> 01:25:20.208
Hi, Lucca.

01:25:21.166 --> 01:25:22.416
-Hello.
-Hi.

01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:23.625
-Ready?
-Yes.

01:25:23.708 --> 01:25:26.125
MINISTRY OF HEALTH

01:25:32.875 --> 01:25:34.791
-Why is Jaramillo here? Did you know?
-No.

01:25:34.875 --> 01:25:36.000
José Antonio.

01:25:36.083 --> 01:25:37.833
Bárbara. Good to see you.

01:25:38.416 --> 01:25:39.583
Hello, good afternoon.

01:25:39.666 --> 01:25:42.291
We were telling the secretary

01:25:42.375 --> 01:25:45.166
that we gave you
the opportunity to test the Cytotron.

01:25:45.250 --> 01:25:46.541
Please, have a seat.

01:25:46.625 --> 01:25:48.708
All right. Look, Jorge.

01:25:49.208 --> 01:25:50.375
This is Lucca.

01:25:50.875 --> 01:25:51.833
She's his mom.

01:25:52.333 --> 01:25:54.875
And you already know Doctor Ibarra.

01:25:54.958 --> 01:25:55.958
Indeed.

01:25:56.458 --> 01:26:00.000
Please, Luis, could you read
the document that we're signing today?

01:26:00.083 --> 01:26:01.125
Of course, sir.

01:26:01.750 --> 01:26:03.041
"As of today's date

01:26:03.125 --> 01:26:06.166
and based on the provisions
of Articles 19 and 20

01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:07.666
of the General Health Law,

01:26:07.750 --> 01:26:09.791
we authorize
the Children's Hospital of Mexico

01:26:09.875 --> 01:26:12.125
to conduct a protocol to be approved

01:26:12.208 --> 01:26:15.750
for clinical trials
with the technology known as Cytotron."

01:26:15.833 --> 01:26:18.791
"In a first stage,
the profile of such tests

01:26:18.875 --> 01:26:20.875
will focus exclusively

01:26:20.958 --> 01:26:23.458
on the oncological use
of this technology."

01:26:23.541 --> 01:26:24.416
No.

01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:27.041
-"For the development of--"
-Excuse me, Secretary.

01:26:27.541 --> 01:26:31.125
Clearly, the hospital has
a high demand from cancer patients

01:26:31.208 --> 01:26:33.916
who will benefit from these trials.

01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:38.541
But we also have many
neurological patients such as Lucca.

01:26:38.625 --> 01:26:40.375
-Who is here--
-Hold on.

01:26:40.458 --> 01:26:43.083
From what Doctor Jaramillo
explained to me,

01:26:43.166 --> 01:26:47.833
I understand the approved protocols
of the machine for commercial use

01:26:47.916 --> 01:26:49.291
cover arthritis and cancer.

01:26:49.375 --> 01:26:51.750
And the acquisition's primary goal

01:26:52.333 --> 01:26:54.000
is proven treatment.

01:26:54.083 --> 01:26:57.083
But the treatment
works for cases like Lucca's.

01:26:57.166 --> 01:26:59.041
We have his file as evidence.

01:26:59.125 --> 01:26:59.958
I know, ma'am.

01:27:00.041 --> 01:27:02.083
And believe me, I am truly glad

01:27:02.166 --> 01:27:04.250
that the treatment worked for your son.

01:27:04.750 --> 01:27:07.125
But we're deciding
for the good of a majority.

01:27:07.208 --> 01:27:08.791
Not individual cases.

01:27:09.291 --> 01:27:12.291
Let's move on to the signing
of the document, if you'd be so kind.

01:27:12.375 --> 01:27:13.208
Of course.

01:27:13.708 --> 01:27:14.541
Please.

01:27:14.625 --> 01:27:15.500
Thank you.

01:27:20.958 --> 01:27:21.916
Here you are.

01:27:22.541 --> 01:27:25.458
Maybe, after all,
we won't win this battle.

01:27:26.208 --> 01:27:27.833
Maybe your dad is right.

01:27:27.916 --> 01:27:29.708
Not everything has to be a battle.

01:27:30.208 --> 01:27:31.833
And it's okay to surrender.

01:27:33.291 --> 01:27:35.083
Or maybe the finish line is not in sight

01:27:35.166 --> 01:27:38.166
because we are
long-distance runners, Luqui.

01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:42.333
And all we need is to enjoy the process.

01:27:42.833 --> 01:27:44.250
To enjoy the view.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.458
To stop and look up to the sky.

01:27:59.916 --> 01:28:02.333
It's a pleasure to begin this ceremony.

01:28:03.041 --> 01:28:05.750
I'd like to begin
by introducing the doctors

01:28:05.833 --> 01:28:08.500
who honor us by attending
this important inauguration.

01:28:08.583 --> 01:28:09.875
CHILDREN'S SPECIALTY HOSPITAL

01:28:10.750 --> 01:28:13.250
First, I'd like to ask
for a round of applause

01:28:13.333 --> 01:28:15.500
for our generous Secretary of Health,

01:28:15.583 --> 01:28:17.041
Doctor Jorge Martinez Navarro.

01:28:17.125 --> 01:28:18.500
CYTOTRON TECHNOLOGY IN MEXICO

01:28:18.583 --> 01:28:21.625
Who honors us with his presence
and is sponsoring this event.

01:28:22.708 --> 01:28:26.000
I'd also like to welcome
Doctor José Antonio Ibarra,

01:28:26.541 --> 01:28:29.500
chief of this hospital's
Neurology Department.

01:28:29.583 --> 01:28:31.750
Mrs. Azucena Monroy.

01:28:32.625 --> 01:28:34.166
And Dr. Ricardo Jaramillo.

01:29:47.208 --> 01:29:52.833
Thanks to more than two decades
of research by many top scientists,

01:29:52.916 --> 01:29:56.541
among whom I am fortunate to count…

01:30:06.541 --> 01:30:07.708
Listen, Lucca.

01:30:08.208 --> 01:30:11.458
This song would make your dad
and me cry when you were a baby.

01:30:37.458 --> 01:30:38.500
What is it, sweetie?

01:30:44.416 --> 01:30:47.041
Are you also happy
we're going back to India?

01:30:48.958 --> 01:30:50.125
Ma.

01:30:51.041 --> 01:30:52.500
What did you say, Lucca?

01:30:53.083 --> 01:30:55.125
Mommy.

01:30:59.208 --> 01:31:00.041
Lucca…

01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:08.625
I love you.

01:31:37.541 --> 01:31:39.708
LUCCA AND HIS FAMILY
MADE THREE MORE TRIPS TO INDIA.

01:31:39.791 --> 01:31:41.791
CURRENTLY, LUCCA
IS FINISHING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

01:31:41.875 --> 01:31:43.625
IN THE SAME GRADE AS HIS BROTHER BRUNO.

01:31:43.708 --> 01:31:45.541
LUCCA HAS BEEN EPILEPSY-FREE
FOR FIVE YEARS

01:31:45.625 --> 01:31:47.166
AND HAS STARTED WALKING AND TALKING.

01:31:48.333 --> 01:31:50.541
IN AUGUST 2021, BÁRBARA,
ANDRÉS, AND A GROUP OF INVESTORS

01:31:50.625 --> 01:31:53.541
BOUGHT TWO CYTOTRON MACHINES
AND OPENED THE FIRST CLINIC OUTSIDE INDIA.

01:31:53.625 --> 01:31:54.916
KUMAR CENTER IS IN MEXICO CITY

01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.333
AND HAS TREATED DOZENS OF PATIENTS
IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE.

01:32:07.750 --> 01:32:09.250
-Dad.
-Present.

01:32:09.875 --> 01:32:11.291
-Naye.
-Present.

01:32:11.375 --> 01:32:12.333
Bruno.

01:32:12.416 --> 01:32:14.875
I always have to be first.

01:32:14.958 --> 01:32:17.291
Okay, your turn.
Bruno Bianciotto Anderson.

01:32:17.791 --> 01:32:19.625
Luquita Bianciotto Anderson.

01:32:20.583 --> 01:32:23.458
-Kind of asleep. Venkatesh?
-Present, ma'am.

01:32:24.000 --> 01:32:25.458
Mom, present.

01:32:27.416 --> 01:32:28.958
-Yeah.
-Bruno, look.

01:32:31.208 --> 01:32:32.833
He sits upright.

01:32:32.916 --> 01:32:35.583
He couldn't do it, but now he can.

01:32:36.541 --> 01:32:39.666
I can hold his legs.
Let's see what happens.

01:32:41.791 --> 01:32:44.041
Up! You can do it!

01:32:45.041 --> 01:32:47.500
Up, sweetie! Hold your head up!

01:32:49.333 --> 01:32:51.375
Bravo!

01:32:51.458 --> 01:32:53.291
Good job!

01:33:21.291 --> 01:33:22.541
There you go.

01:33:22.625 --> 01:33:25.000
We're having such a nice walk.

01:33:25.708 --> 01:33:26.791
Don't you think?

01:33:29.708 --> 01:33:30.541
Yes?

01:35:07.833 --> 01:35:10.375
