03:11.191 --> 03:12.984
How did you know...

03:13.151 --> 03:14.944
that was the blue one?

03:16.530 --> 03:19.407
- I do not know, master.
- You do not know?

03:21.743 --> 03:23.202
No.

03:28.250 --> 03:30.543
I humbly apologize
for my ignorance, master.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.796
I will do anything
to prove my worthiness.

03:34.464 --> 03:37.216
You have been
to the movies again, I see.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.678
Full of disciples falling
to their knees...

03:40.846 --> 03:45.224
at the slightest hint
of their master's displeasure.

03:45.392 --> 03:49.604
Leroy, this is not a punishment.

03:50.856 --> 03:52.815
It is a celebration.

03:52.983 --> 03:55.109
You have touched the final level.

03:55.277 --> 03:57.987
You knew without knowing.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.198
We have finished our journey together.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.618
But, master...

04:04.494 --> 04:06.662
the final level.

04:06.830 --> 04:09.290
The glow. You always said that...

04:09.458 --> 04:12.168
That when you reached the final level...

04:12.336 --> 04:16.088
you would know it by the appearance
of a sublime glow...

04:16.255 --> 04:18.966
all over your body. Come, Leroy.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.469
Get up.

04:23.597 --> 04:28.017
What you seek
is not written on the floor.

04:29.102 --> 04:33.397
The final level is a return
to the beginning.

04:33.565 --> 04:37.234
This is the Last Dragon.

04:38.362 --> 04:41.030
A cycle is complete...

04:41.198 --> 04:45.242
and now there is
a new emptiness to be filled...

04:45.410 --> 04:48.079
a new journey which you must make alone.

04:48.705 --> 04:50.414
- I am confused.
- Good.

04:50.582 --> 04:55.920
Good. Confusion is a part of life,
as are vengeance, fear and love.

04:56.088 --> 04:58.881
All facets must be embraced...

04:59.049 --> 05:01.300
for then and only then...

05:01.468 --> 05:05.763
will you break through
the wall of mystery to the glow.

05:06.348 --> 05:08.808
Master, perhaps with more time to train.

05:08.976 --> 05:14.355
- Master, I need more time.
- I am no longer your master.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.074
Leroy...

05:26.284 --> 05:28.369
if it is a master...

05:28.537 --> 05:30.371
you must have...

05:30.914 --> 05:34.959
there is an old sage called Sum Dum Goy.

05:35.127 --> 05:39.255
He is said to be the wisest man
in the universe. Go, find him.

05:39.423 --> 05:41.173
He is here in New York.

05:53.145 --> 05:56.772
Take this. It was Bruce Lee's.

05:57.733 --> 06:01.652
When you find the master
who will take you to the final level...

06:01.820 --> 06:03.571
give it to him.

06:05.198 --> 06:09.285
Go now, my son, on your journey.

06:11.538 --> 06:12.913
Go.

06:13.415 --> 06:14.415
Go.

07:05.884 --> 07:07.093
<i>Mr. Lee?</i>

07:09.262 --> 07:10.930
<i>Are you ready?</i>

07:24.653 --> 07:25.820
<i>Bolo.</i>

07:34.663 --> 07:37.623
Joints and bags! Joints and bags!

07:39.459 --> 07:42.878
Put his butt on the chuck wagon
and send his ass to the dogs.

07:47.175 --> 07:48.634
In his butt.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.013
- Shuffle on him, Bruce!
- Sting him!

08:21.376 --> 08:22.835
For real though.

08:25.964 --> 08:29.592
That's that, man,
and there ain't no coming back.

08:30.594 --> 08:34.804
<i>Oharra's treachery has disgraced
the house.</i>

08:42.563 --> 08:45.024
- Hey, is this part of the show?
- What is this?

08:45.192 --> 08:47.693
Oh, patty-cake shit.

08:51.823 --> 08:53.908
- Am I the meanest?
- Sho'nuff!

08:54.075 --> 08:56.493
- Am I the prettiest?
- Sho'nuff!

08:56.661 --> 08:59.955
Am I the baddest mofo
lowdown around this town?

09:00.123 --> 09:01.957
- Sho'nuff!
- Well, who am I?

09:02.125 --> 09:03.250
Sho'nuff!

09:03.418 --> 09:05.669
- Who am I?
- Sho'nuff!

09:05.837 --> 09:08.297
I can't hear you.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.466
Sho'nuff!

09:13.386 --> 09:16.847
The shogun of Harlem.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.857
Crunch, seats.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.612
This is Sho's row. Move it.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.781
I said, beat it!

09:34.574 --> 09:37.117
I know who can beat you!

09:37.285 --> 09:39.745
Who said that?
Beast, find who said that!

09:39.913 --> 09:41.622
I got him, Sho. I got him.

09:41.790 --> 09:44.250
I got him, Sho. I got him.

09:45.210 --> 09:48.295
Here you go, Sho.
Here's the roach who said it.

09:49.673 --> 09:52.049
Who's badder than the shogun?

09:52.217 --> 09:54.385
Bruce Leroy, that's who!

09:55.011 --> 09:56.845
Bruce Leroy?

09:57.764 --> 10:00.266
Bruce Leroy?

10:03.687 --> 10:09.191
That's the only guy that stands
between Sho and total supremacy.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.452
Well, well, well.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.663
If it ain't the serious...

10:22.831 --> 10:25.457
and saucy Leroy Green.

10:27.419 --> 10:30.254
I've been waiting
a long time for this, Leroy.

10:30.422 --> 10:34.341
I am sick of hearing
these bullshit superman stories...

10:34.509 --> 10:38.012
about the "wahsa,"
legendary Bruce Leroy...

10:38.179 --> 10:41.765
catching bullets with his teeth.

10:41.933 --> 10:45.311
Catches bullets with his teeth?

10:45.687 --> 10:47.438
Nigga, please.

10:48.106 --> 10:51.233
The secret awaits eyes
unclouded by ambition.

10:51.401 --> 10:52.401
What?

10:52.569 --> 10:54.903
Those who are bound by desire...

10:55.071 --> 10:57.865
see only that which can be held
in their hands.

10:58.033 --> 11:00.659
See, now it is mumbo jumbo like that...

11:01.453 --> 11:02.703
Yeah, yeah.

11:03.455 --> 11:06.915
...and skinny lizards like you
thinking they're the Last Dragon...

11:07.083 --> 11:09.501
that gives kung fu a bad name.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.254
Get up, Leroy.

11:12.422 --> 11:15.299
I got something real for your ass
in these hands.

11:15.467 --> 11:18.594
We gonna settle this once and for all
because I am back.

11:18.762 --> 11:22.723
The shogun is back on the scene
and the shogun is the master.

11:22.891 --> 11:25.601
Why don't you sit down and shut up?

11:25.769 --> 11:29.063
What? Why don't I sit down and what?!

11:29.230 --> 11:31.565
I said, "Why don't you sit down
and shut up?"

11:31.733 --> 11:34.985
Why don't anybody who wants me
to sit down and shut up...

11:35.153 --> 11:37.654
come down here and make me?

11:38.490 --> 11:42.493
Why don't any 50 of you who want me
to sit down and shut up...

11:42.660 --> 11:45.412
come down here just for the fun of it?

11:46.122 --> 11:47.623
Yeah, come on, fool.

11:47.791 --> 11:49.958
This fool's mine.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.047
Jack him up, baby!

11:57.050 --> 11:58.884
Don't hurt that face, baby!

11:59.052 --> 12:00.511
Yeah!

12:27.664 --> 12:30.833
Leroy! I'm going to...

12:40.176 --> 12:43.971
You'll never use this foot again!

12:44.139 --> 12:45.764
Jack him up!

12:48.351 --> 12:49.893
Leroy!

12:50.061 --> 12:51.895
I'm gonna get you, Leroy...

12:52.063 --> 12:53.939
because I am the shogun!

12:54.107 --> 12:57.192
And I will not rest
until everybody knows...

12:57.360 --> 12:59.445
shogun is the master!

13:03.074 --> 13:05.200
You wimp.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.514
Still hungry, are we?

13:28.308 --> 13:31.101
I've got a surprise dessert.

13:59.881 --> 14:03.759
<i>Live from Seventh Heaven</i>,
it's Laura's Video Hotpix...

14:03.927 --> 14:05.802
<i>brought to you by Coca-Cola.</i>

14:05.970 --> 14:07.888
<i>Coke is it.</i>

14:12.477 --> 14:14.394
Soon that's gonna be you, Angie...

14:14.562 --> 14:17.272
dancing around on that screen,
ain't that right?

14:17.440 --> 14:20.776
Hey, Angie, baby, soon that's gonna
be you up there, huh?

14:20.944 --> 14:22.736
Oh, yeah!

14:22.904 --> 14:25.447
That's my girl!

14:29.827 --> 14:32.538
My little dodo turd-brain's
gonna be a star.

14:32.705 --> 14:35.958
If you'd have put this energy
into getting me a title fight...

14:36.125 --> 14:38.502
maybe I'd have been
on my way to Vegas now.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.837
You lost, Rock, you lost.

14:41.005 --> 14:42.881
Every fight I got you.

14:43.049 --> 14:45.884
"The Great White Hopeless,"
they called you. Remember?

14:46.052 --> 14:48.178
What do you think
they're gonna call her?

14:48.346 --> 14:51.056
A goddess is what they're gonna
call her. A goddess.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.642
What she'll do to people
has never been done.

14:53.810 --> 14:55.811
- Make them run for cover?
- That's cute.

15:00.108 --> 15:03.443
And now,
for my video hot-pick of the week...

15:03.611 --> 15:06.071
And it is hot.

15:06.489 --> 15:09.241
I say we rock on with DeBarge.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.536
"Rhythm of the Night."

15:52.619 --> 15:54.661
I don't know what you're doing anyway.

15:54.829 --> 15:56.496
Give me five minutes, Eddie...

15:56.664 --> 15:59.249
and this chick will beg
to play this thing.

15:59.417 --> 16:02.127
You got no class.
I know how to handle these types.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.297
You gotta wine them, dine them,
let them order Ã  la carte.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.216
After all, me and this lady,
we got a lot in common.

16:08.384 --> 16:12.387
She's the video-rock queen, but I,
Eddie Arkadian, am the video-game king.

16:12.555 --> 16:16.016
She's got the audience, I got the vision.
A match made in heaven.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.143
Jesus!

16:19.812 --> 16:21.980
I told you to get rid of that thing.

16:22.148 --> 16:25.859
You also told me, "Keep it.
It comes in handy." Remember?

16:26.027 --> 16:29.780
Yeah, yeah, I remember.
Damn, that thing gives me the creeps.

17:21.665 --> 17:26.252
Come on, we're just talking about
one dinner out of your life.

17:26.421 --> 17:28.630
Come on, at least have dinner with him.

17:28.798 --> 17:30.966
J.J., I would love to help you out...

17:31.134 --> 17:34.136
but my show is booked solid
for the next four weeks.

17:34.303 --> 17:36.179
So you're just gonna have to wait.

17:36.347 --> 17:38.598
- Honey...
- Please, we've got a show to do.

17:38.766 --> 17:41.309
Will you at least look at the videotape?

17:41.477 --> 17:44.146
- J.J., there is no point.
- Laura, there is a point.

17:44.313 --> 17:46.523
The point of the knife
which is at my neck.

17:46.691 --> 17:49.526
He'll slit my throat
if you don't do this. Come on!

17:49.694 --> 17:51.611
What are you talking about, J.J.?

17:51.779 --> 17:54.865
- Who's gonna slit your throat?
- Sit down, we've got a show!

17:55.032 --> 17:56.658
Laura, this guy plays rough.

17:56.826 --> 17:58.660
Thirty seconds, Laura.

17:58.828 --> 18:01.371
What guy? Okay. Tell me, J.J., who?

18:01.539 --> 18:03.582
- Eddie Arkadian.
- Who is Eddie Arkadian?

18:03.750 --> 18:07.043
Arkadian is a heavy dude
who wants to have this videotape...

18:07.211 --> 18:09.504
played in the worst way. Come on, Laura.

18:09.672 --> 18:13.675
Fifteen seconds, Laura. Come on.
Come on. Let's go! Let's go.

18:13.843 --> 18:15.594
Give me a break.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.679
Why don't you just call a cop, okay?

18:17.847 --> 18:20.223
My life is not filled
with all that craziness.

18:20.391 --> 18:23.977
- Five seconds! Four. Three.
- Tell whatever his name is to forget it.

18:24.145 --> 18:27.564
- Arkadian. Laura!
- Two. One. You're on!

20:00.616 --> 20:03.326
Thank you, everybody,
and welcome to Seventh Heaven.

20:03.494 --> 20:06.079
I'm glad you made it.
I'm glad I made it.

20:06.247 --> 20:08.456
Today my special guests,
the tastemakers...

20:08.624 --> 20:11.918
from the now generation,
with my Cloud Crowd.

20:12.879 --> 20:16.089
Yo, J.J., my main man! What's happening?

20:18.384 --> 20:19.885
What?

20:20.052 --> 20:22.012
<i>That's Saturday at 5:00...</i>

20:22.179 --> 20:25.640
Nobody turns down
an Eddie Arkadian invitation.

20:26.142 --> 20:27.350
Nobody.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.811
So come and join us
because the winner...

20:29.979 --> 20:33.481
will get a Seventh Heavenly evening
out on the town with me.

20:33.649 --> 20:35.817
What do you think about that?

20:37.320 --> 20:38.862
How about a kiss?!

20:39.030 --> 20:40.196
Who said that?

20:40.364 --> 20:42.365
- I said it!
- No, I said it!

20:42.533 --> 20:44.075
A kiss?

20:44.243 --> 20:46.411
Well, you never know.

20:46.996 --> 20:48.997
But here's one for now.

20:50.875 --> 20:52.459
Got it!

21:25.076 --> 21:26.618
Yeah.

21:35.378 --> 21:37.253
That's my babe.

21:37.421 --> 21:40.131
- What you talking about?
- That's my woman up there.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.300
She don't know it yet, but she's mine.

21:44.553 --> 21:46.096
Yeah.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.350
Yeah.

22:01.362 --> 22:03.154
Oh, here she comes.

22:03.322 --> 22:06.324
- Laura! Oh, Laura, sign here!
- I love you, Laura!

22:08.744 --> 22:11.579
- Please!
- We love you! We love you, Laura!

22:14.583 --> 22:16.418
We love you!

22:53.748 --> 22:57.167
- How you doing tonight, Sal?
- You just sit back and relax.

22:57.334 --> 22:59.294
Sal got sick.

22:59.462 --> 23:02.630
- Hey, what are you doing?
- The right thing, Miss Charles...

23:02.798 --> 23:05.800
which is what you're gonna do
if you got half a brain.

23:10.556 --> 23:13.224
- Help! Help! Somebody help me!
- Put her in the car!

23:13.392 --> 23:15.393
Come on, get her in here.

23:15.561 --> 23:18.521
- Help me, somebody!
- Get in the car, bitch!

23:20.107 --> 23:21.274
You...

23:21.442 --> 23:23.359
I would not do that if I were you.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.905
You little punk.

23:37.416 --> 23:40.835
Hey, what are you, crazy?
Huh, tough guy? Come on!

23:44.965 --> 23:46.633
Your mother. All right?

23:46.801 --> 23:48.301
Come on, tough guy.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.223
Come on! Come here!

23:53.390 --> 23:55.517
Stay there for me. Stay there.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.185
Stay there.

24:06.112 --> 24:07.612
Help!

24:27.883 --> 24:29.884
- Are you all right, miss?
- Yeah.

24:30.052 --> 24:31.553
Yeah.

24:32.012 --> 24:35.014
I don't know. I guess so.

24:38.144 --> 24:40.478
What about you? Are you okay?

24:40.646 --> 24:42.772
They did not harm me.

24:54.160 --> 24:55.994
Your things.

25:04.795 --> 25:07.213
That's okay. I can get them.

25:09.091 --> 25:11.551
It seems that everything is safe now.

25:11.719 --> 25:13.261
Yeah.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.812
You sure you're all right?

25:22.980 --> 25:26.900
Yeah, really.
Just a little shaken up, I think.

25:27.067 --> 25:29.402
God, what was that all about?

25:30.821 --> 25:32.238
I don't believe it.

25:32.406 --> 25:34.449
You were really something, boy.

25:34.617 --> 25:37.035
I just don't know how to thank you.

25:47.046 --> 25:50.298
- Did you see where that guy went?
- Yeah, he's right...

25:50.466 --> 25:53.218
I don't know. What?
You getting in or what?

26:07.983 --> 26:10.109
Come on, honey, let's go.

26:19.328 --> 26:22.247
Where is that deejay lady anyway?

26:22.414 --> 26:24.332
I mean, what's the big deal?

26:24.500 --> 26:26.125
Can't she just meet us there?

26:26.293 --> 26:29.212
Angela, sweetheart, shut up.

26:29.380 --> 26:31.798
But, Eddie, I'm hungry. I wanna go!

26:31.966 --> 26:34.133
I said, shut up!

26:34.301 --> 26:36.678
Oh, jeez. Don't cry.

26:36.845 --> 26:40.473
Listen, Laura what's-her-face
is gonna be here any second.

26:40.641 --> 26:45.144
We don't want our star to look like
a little pig peed in her eyes now, do we?

26:45.312 --> 26:47.438
Then knock it off.

26:47.606 --> 26:49.941
Don't bug me! Fix your face!

26:50.109 --> 26:51.859
Shut up!

26:53.946 --> 26:58.074
As soon as the chick gets here,
we leave, okay? Okay.

27:20.139 --> 27:21.306
- Now, boss...
- Boss.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.267
Boss, don't get mad
because it wasn't our fault.

27:24.435 --> 27:26.936
- There was nothing we could do.
- Her bodyguards.

27:27.104 --> 27:29.105
There must have been 20 or 30 of them.

27:29.273 --> 27:32.025
- These big... Yeah, black guys.
- Black guys!

27:32.192 --> 27:35.486
- Yeah, with chains.
- Chains, clubs, they had everything.

27:35.654 --> 27:37.864
They had pipes, bats,
they had everything!

27:38.032 --> 27:39.657
All right, all right!

27:40.534 --> 27:43.077
So the broad wants to play tough, huh?

27:44.496 --> 27:45.913
All right.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.542
Two of us can play that game.

27:49.960 --> 27:52.837
Hey, Rock! Come here.

27:58.927 --> 28:00.470
Got a little job for you.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.847
The tank?

28:04.224 --> 28:06.225
Bring her back in one piece, will you?

28:06.393 --> 28:07.769
<i>Chinese GoJu is my secret.</i>

28:07.936 --> 28:08.978
I bear no arms.

28:09.146 --> 28:11.564
Chinese GoJu is my secret.
I bear no arms.

28:11.732 --> 28:14.108
May God help me
if I ever have to use my art.

28:14.276 --> 28:16.903
May God help me
if I ever have to use my art.

28:17.071 --> 28:19.113
Conscience is our guide.

28:19.281 --> 28:22.033
Peace is our shelter.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.994
Beauty and perfection is our life.

28:25.913 --> 28:27.705
See the courtesy.

28:31.001 --> 28:32.001
Break.

28:44.473 --> 28:45.973
Johnny, what are you doing?

28:47.017 --> 28:50.311
Well, you see, Leroy, you know
how you're always teaching us...

28:50.479 --> 28:53.523
to master the art of fighting
without fighting?

28:53.690 --> 28:55.233
Well, I did you one better.

28:55.401 --> 28:58.861
I mastered the art of fighting
without knowing how to fight.

28:59.446 --> 29:00.822
You see, people...

29:00.989 --> 29:03.199
People are afraid of Oriental dudes.

29:03.367 --> 29:06.327
Give them a little move,
a little scream...

29:06.495 --> 29:08.413
and lots of attitude.

29:08.580 --> 29:10.289
Check this out.

29:24.012 --> 29:25.096
Johnny...

29:25.264 --> 29:28.433
to seek safety, one must go
to the heart of danger.

29:32.521 --> 29:34.730
Yeah.

29:34.898 --> 29:36.941
Yeah.

29:43.449 --> 29:48.619
The sign outside says this here school
is for instructions in the martial arts.

29:49.079 --> 29:51.747
So we thought we might get some lessons.

29:51.915 --> 29:53.332
Yeah, where do we sign up?

29:53.500 --> 29:55.710
- How many yen?
- I'd like to learn kung fu.

29:55.878 --> 29:58.463
- Come on, hot stuff.
- Come on, Leroy.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.340
Teach me something.

30:01.508 --> 30:03.342
I do not wish to fight you.

30:04.386 --> 30:07.763
Well, who do you "wish" to fight, then?

30:07.931 --> 30:11.100
One of them? Or one of the ladies maybe?

30:11.268 --> 30:13.978
Yeah, since you're too much
of a sissy to fight me...

30:14.146 --> 30:16.522
maybe they're more your speed.

30:16.690 --> 30:17.940
Get him, girls.

30:18.108 --> 30:21.444
Maybe you can get a rise
out of this limp wimp.

30:25.282 --> 30:27.325
- You wanna wrestle?
- Hey, little girl.

30:27.493 --> 30:29.869
All you've got is this bod,
and that's it.

30:30.037 --> 30:33.498
I would love to peel this banana.

30:33.665 --> 30:36.584
Come on, handsome, show us your stuff!

30:36.752 --> 30:40.213
How about a little kiss on my fist?

30:40.380 --> 30:43.508
He's too much of a gentleman
to hit a lady.

30:45.636 --> 30:47.512
Who looks scared to me!

30:48.597 --> 30:51.349
Yeah! Come on, Leroy!

30:58.607 --> 31:01.651
- Yeah, that's right! Bow, sucker!
- Yeah.

31:01.818 --> 31:04.654
Bow down to your master!

31:04.821 --> 31:08.491
Yeah, coolie, kiss my Converse.

31:10.577 --> 31:13.204
- So sorry. Excuse me.
- Bow!

31:13.664 --> 31:14.747
Bow!

31:14.915 --> 31:16.374
Kiss Daddy's shoes.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.417
- Bow!
- Kiss Daddy's shoes.

31:18.585 --> 31:20.503
- Bow!
- So sorry.

31:20.671 --> 31:22.588
- Bow!
- I'm sorry.

31:22.756 --> 31:24.257
Bow!

31:24.424 --> 31:25.591
Bow!

31:28.512 --> 31:29.887
Enough!

31:30.055 --> 31:31.430
You wanna fight?

31:31.598 --> 31:36.185
You fight me, you big, ugly,
smelly-breathed sucker!

31:38.814 --> 31:42.275
How about you, string bean,
Rick-James-looking fool?

31:42.442 --> 31:44.443
Beast, kill him!

31:48.615 --> 31:50.950
- Get him, Beast!
- That boy's in trouble now.

31:55.455 --> 31:59.917
Bow down or I'm gonna snap
this clown in two!

32:01.211 --> 32:03.421
Yeah, that's right, fool.

32:05.048 --> 32:06.257
Kiss them.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.011
Down.

32:18.312 --> 32:20.980
Beast, let him go.

32:22.983 --> 32:26.360
You may not wish
to fight me now, sucker.

32:26.528 --> 32:28.487
But you will. I'm gonna see to that.

32:30.866 --> 32:32.992
Sayonara.

32:33.785 --> 32:36.037
- Who's the master?!
- Sho'nuff!

32:36.204 --> 32:38.414
- Who's the master?!
- Sho'nuff!

32:38.582 --> 32:40.124
- Who's the master?!
- Sho'nuff!

32:40.292 --> 32:42.627
- The shogun of Harlem!
- Yeah!

32:43.920 --> 32:45.296
Yeah!

32:47.633 --> 32:52.094
Sometimes it is hard
to live the way of the wise.

32:56.308 --> 32:57.600
Hey, Reloy!

32:57.768 --> 33:01.270
Your papa-san,
he wants you in the kitchen, man!

33:08.820 --> 33:10.696
Green Sanitarium, warden speaking...

33:10.864 --> 33:14.158
and our inmates are off
to a promising start this morning.

33:14.326 --> 33:17.036
Who's calling? Yo, Roy.

33:17.204 --> 33:18.329
I can't come now.

33:18.497 --> 33:21.957
I'm held captive till the coolie kid
comes down from the roof.

33:22.125 --> 33:25.711
He's becoming one
with his brain again. Yeah.

33:25.879 --> 33:29.090
All right, I'll catch you later
at the rehearsal. All right.

33:33.053 --> 33:34.929
Hey, let me get this straight.

33:35.097 --> 33:38.015
The prize in this contest
you hope to win is a date?

33:38.183 --> 33:39.684
"Am" gonna win.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.520
And it ain't no thing
and the prize ain't no date.

33:42.688 --> 33:46.357
- A night with Laura Charles is an event.
- Oh, excuse me.

33:47.109 --> 33:50.194
Mama-san, Papa-san...

33:50.362 --> 33:52.071
Richie-san...

33:52.239 --> 33:54.907
Lotus Blossom-san.

33:57.285 --> 33:59.286
Isn't that nice, Sophia?

33:59.454 --> 34:01.288
Pretty chopsticks, Natasha.

34:02.499 --> 34:04.875
Thank you.

34:05.043 --> 34:08.420
I wish you all would decide on one name
for this poor child.

34:08.588 --> 34:11.674
- No wonder she's so confused.
- Bless this food.

34:11.842 --> 34:15.010
It is to build thy body temple.
Spiritualize it.

34:15.178 --> 34:17.138
Telling you, Pop, the boy is off it.

34:17.304 --> 34:19.931
Stupid old clothes,
won't mess with no babes.

34:20.100 --> 34:23.393
- People talk, you know.
- Richard, leave your brother alone.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.521
I can't help it if he's weird.

34:25.688 --> 34:27.398
You're weird, man, really weird.

34:27.565 --> 34:31.360
Richie, when I first started my business,
people said I was weird.

34:31.527 --> 34:33.362
A black man with a pizza shop.

34:33.530 --> 34:37.324
Now there isn't a hungry soul in this town
that doesn't know my slogan:

34:37.492 --> 34:40.745
"Just direct-a your feets-a
to Daddy Green's..."

34:40.911 --> 34:42.913
- "Pizza."
- <i>Hi, I'm Laura.</i>

34:43.081 --> 34:45.123
Watch yourself, son.

34:45.292 --> 34:48.543
<i>My personal choices
for Video Hotpix of the week...</i>

34:48.712 --> 34:51.880
That's my babe, Pop!
That's my date for tonight.

34:52.047 --> 34:53.841
<i>Because it's alive...</i>

34:54.342 --> 34:56.217
<i>and very, very exciting.</i>

34:56.928 --> 34:58.846
- That is her.
- You telling me?

34:59.014 --> 35:01.766
You better believe that's her.
That's Laura Charles.

35:01.933 --> 35:05.269
<i>So you remember now,
every weekday night at 8:00.</i>

35:05.437 --> 35:07.021
Laura Charles.

35:07.189 --> 35:09.982
- I would like to see her.
- Well, who wouldn't, fool?

35:10.150 --> 35:11.525
"I would like to see her."

35:11.693 --> 35:15.154
No way the queen is gonna be looking
at no walking fortune cookie.

35:15.322 --> 35:17.406
"I would like to see her."

35:17.574 --> 35:20.951
- Well, I'll see her today, at rehearsal.
- You know where she is?

35:21.119 --> 35:23.788
- I know where she's gonna be.
- Take me to see her.

35:23.955 --> 35:26.624
I ain't taking you nowhere.
You might embarrass me.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.667
You're too weird.

35:32.964 --> 35:36.175
You do not understand.
She may have something I need.

35:36.343 --> 35:38.385
I knew it would happen sooner or later.

35:38.553 --> 35:41.263
You stood on your head so long,
you broke it.

35:41.431 --> 35:43.224
Look, let me break it down to you.

35:43.391 --> 35:47.019
You seem to be wanting to broaden...
Get it? ...your horizons.

35:47.187 --> 35:51.190
You let a lot of good years roll by
without even testing the old equipment.

35:51.358 --> 35:55.861
Now, even you being a disgrace and all,
I'd be less than a man if I didn't warn you...

35:56.029 --> 35:59.865
there's an art to making love
and you don't even have a paintbrush.

36:00.033 --> 36:03.994
You gotta know the moves, baby.
You know, the moves.

36:05.372 --> 36:06.372
<i>Richie...</i>

36:06.540 --> 36:08.541
I am not concerned with moves.

36:08.708 --> 36:11.126
My concern is something else.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.254
Else? What else is there?

36:13.421 --> 36:16.215
Please, I must see her.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.260
I don't see why I'm getting so upset.

36:19.427 --> 36:24.515
Go on, go after a goddess if you want to,
but let me tell you something.

36:24.683 --> 36:28.018
The worst thing that can happen to you
is that she says yes.

36:28.186 --> 36:31.856
Ain't no woman like that gonna hold still
while you figure it out.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.525
Not only do you not know
when to do something...

36:34.693 --> 36:37.653
you wouldn't know
where to put it if you did.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.573
And, Leroy...

36:41.783 --> 36:45.035
it can really hurt if you don't know
what you're doing.

36:45.203 --> 36:48.289
Richie, I must go to this dance contest.

36:48.665 --> 36:51.667
I ain't taking you nowhere,
and that's final.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.713
Please.

36:57.090 --> 36:58.716
Kiss my hand.

36:58.884 --> 37:01.093
Richie, please.

37:01.261 --> 37:02.887
Maybe I'll take you...

37:03.054 --> 37:07.308
if you carry me all the way
on your back and rap.

37:07.475 --> 37:08.767
- Rap? Me?
- Yeah.

37:08.935 --> 37:10.936
What it smell like? I think I have it.

37:11.104 --> 37:15.608
What it is? What it...
What it look like? Do it.

37:15.775 --> 37:16.775
Yeah, baby.

37:16.943 --> 37:21.447
Do it, do it. What... What it be like?
What it...

37:21.615 --> 37:23.490
Okay. That's it, that's it.

37:23.658 --> 37:25.451
That is it, stop.

37:25.619 --> 37:27.161
Stop right here.

37:27.329 --> 37:29.288
It is pit... It's just pitiful.

37:29.456 --> 37:31.957
- Give me one more chance!
- No. It is pitiful.

37:32.125 --> 37:33.542
Put me down.

37:34.336 --> 37:36.253
Put me down.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.339
It's pitiful.

37:46.181 --> 37:49.308
Richie, where are you going?
Are you not gonna buy tickets?

37:55.565 --> 37:58.609
Of course I'm gonna buy tickets!

37:58.777 --> 38:03.739
I never buy tickets,
you shrimp-fried-rice head, you.

38:03.907 --> 38:06.784
Man, if anyone asks you,
you ain't my brother, okay?

38:06.952 --> 38:08.327
What?

38:08.495 --> 38:11.705
You ain't my brother, that's all.
Now, come on!

38:18.546 --> 38:20.422
Come on, move it!

38:31.851 --> 38:35.854
See, man, messing around with you,
now my boys don't even know I'm here.

38:36.022 --> 38:38.691
You're not trying to enter
without paying, are you?

38:38.858 --> 38:41.777
Chill out, chopsticks.
Let me handle this.

38:41.945 --> 38:44.113
There must be another door.

38:45.699 --> 38:48.409
I'll be back.
Just stay right here and don't move.

38:48.576 --> 38:53.497
- And if anyone asks, remember...
- I know, I ain't your brother.

39:11.307 --> 39:13.350
Why wasn't this sound check done sooner?

39:13.518 --> 39:16.687
I don't know. I only do what I'm told.
We try for perfection!

39:17.731 --> 39:18.981
Help!

39:20.734 --> 39:22.401
Let me go!

39:22.569 --> 39:23.902
- Help!
- Let's go, Tony!

39:27.824 --> 39:29.366
Help!

39:29.534 --> 39:30.826
Help!

40:48.113 --> 40:51.448
<i>And to think how I found them
in your suitcase.</i>

40:57.664 --> 40:59.748
Don't you love it?

40:59.916 --> 41:02.668
Doll, did I do you a favor
or did I do you a favor?

41:02.836 --> 41:04.670
So you're gonna play my video, huh?

41:06.005 --> 41:07.673
No.

41:09.384 --> 41:11.552
Maybe you didn't hear it right.

41:12.470 --> 41:15.055
So I'm gonna ask you one more time.

41:15.849 --> 41:18.684
Are you gonna put my video
on your show or aren't you?

41:18.852 --> 41:23.063
I'm gonna tell you one more time.
The answer is no.

41:24.566 --> 41:26.316
It's not that I don't like it.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.944
- It's just that it's not the right...
- Right!

41:29.863 --> 41:32.197
Right time of the night to look at it.

41:32.365 --> 41:34.867
That's what she was gonna say,
wasn't it, honey?

41:35.034 --> 41:37.619
Oh, Eddie, she's just tired.

41:38.454 --> 41:39.955
Tired, huh?

41:40.123 --> 41:43.083
She's gonna be dead tired,
she's not careful.

41:43.501 --> 41:46.044
Okay, I tried to be
a gentleman about this!

41:46.212 --> 41:48.463
I was gonna take you out
to a fancy restaurant.

41:48.631 --> 41:50.382
Let you order Ã  la carte, huh?

41:50.884 --> 41:53.051
All I wanted was my video
on your show...

41:53.219 --> 41:54.428
and now you say no.

41:57.015 --> 41:59.057
Okay, that's it. No more Mr. Nice Guy.

41:59.225 --> 42:00.976
Rock, let's go.

42:01.352 --> 42:03.979
Eddie, you're not gonna do
what I think you are?

42:04.147 --> 42:05.856
Who's gonna stop me?

42:07.525 --> 42:09.193
Who's this? We didn't order out.

42:09.360 --> 42:12.487
Get him the hell out of here!
Get him out of here now!

42:17.869 --> 42:21.246
Who the hell is this guy? Get in there!
Break his face, will you?

42:26.753 --> 42:28.921
What are you guys waiting for?
Get going!

42:29.088 --> 42:30.672
Are you on vacation? Move it!

42:30.840 --> 42:32.257
Get in there!

42:42.894 --> 42:44.811
Get going!

42:56.491 --> 42:59.326
- Oh, I'm sorry, Miss...
- Angela.

42:59.494 --> 43:01.286
Angela Viracco.

43:04.499 --> 43:05.499
Bums.

43:07.794 --> 43:11.672
I do not think
Miss Charles enjoys your company.

43:11.839 --> 43:14.841
It would be best
that you leave her alone.

43:15.009 --> 43:18.762
I don't know who you are, pal,
but you're in a lot of trouble!

43:22.308 --> 43:25.060
Hothead needs cool water.

43:26.020 --> 43:28.105
No, no, no!

43:28.273 --> 43:30.065
- No. No, not the tank!
- No!

43:30.233 --> 43:31.316
No!

43:36.030 --> 43:37.572
No!

43:39.117 --> 43:40.534
Eddie.

43:41.327 --> 43:43.704
Come, you will be safe now.

43:45.373 --> 43:48.709
- Eddie, are you all right?
- Get away from me, you dumb broad!

43:48.876 --> 43:51.795
But, Eddie, you're all wet!

43:51.963 --> 43:53.797
Oh, honey.

43:57.677 --> 44:01.388
Look at this, it's all wet.
You're all wet.

44:01.556 --> 44:03.682
Rock, get this damn thing out of here.

44:03.850 --> 44:06.727
That son of a bitch is history.

44:11.566 --> 44:14.067
Oh, God, I can't believe this!

44:14.235 --> 44:16.570
This is enough to drive you crazy.

44:16.738 --> 44:19.072
You do this kind of thing every day?

44:19.240 --> 44:21.366
You are too much.

44:22.368 --> 44:23.827
Who are you?

44:23.995 --> 44:26.872
I am Leroy. Leroy Green.

44:27.040 --> 44:30.584
- It's nice to meet you, Leroy.
- Oh, it's nice to meet you.

44:31.419 --> 44:34.921
I need a drink.
Why don't you come inside?

44:37.508 --> 44:41.011
Miss Charles, there is something
you may be able to help me with.

44:41.179 --> 44:42.721
You can call me Laura.

44:42.889 --> 44:45.432
Laura, the other night
I lost a medallion and...

44:45.600 --> 44:47.726
That thing that looks like
a belt buckle?

44:47.894 --> 44:49.144
Belt buckle?

44:49.854 --> 44:52.314
- Is it gold?
- You have it?!

44:52.482 --> 44:56.109
Yeah, I got it. Why don't you sit down?
I'll go get it for you.

45:00.114 --> 45:01.990
That is wonderful.

45:02.158 --> 45:06.703
Just promise me that you won't vanish
as soon as I give it back to you.

45:42.990 --> 45:45.659
This is so you'll never lose it again.

45:45.827 --> 45:47.702
I am deeply in your debt.

45:53.209 --> 45:55.168
It is very valuable to me.

45:57.713 --> 46:00.757
I know what it's like
to lose precious things...

46:01.759 --> 46:04.678
and then, of course, to find them again.

46:06.764 --> 46:07.889
You thirsty?

46:14.522 --> 46:18.191
From the clock's chime
to the cock's crow is but an instant.

46:19.610 --> 46:21.403
I must go.

46:22.989 --> 46:24.239
Oh, excuse me.

46:26.033 --> 46:27.576
I'm sorry.

46:31.998 --> 46:33.874
"Cock's crow"?

47:47.323 --> 47:48.782
All right!

47:51.953 --> 47:54.287
- What you looking for?
- For the master.

47:54.455 --> 47:56.331
Ain't no masters here, dude.

47:56.499 --> 47:58.917
Ain't no slaves either.

48:01.462 --> 48:03.672
Is this not his fortune-cookie factory?

48:03.839 --> 48:07.342
The master, he doing his wisdom thing.

48:08.010 --> 48:10.095
I seek only wisdom of the master.

48:10.263 --> 48:13.139
You want wisdom, you buy fortune cookie.

48:13.307 --> 48:15.308
- Take a hike, cool breeze.
- Yeah, baby.

48:15.476 --> 48:17.310
Please, I must see the master.

48:17.478 --> 48:19.938
- It is very important to me.
- Look here, chump.

48:20.106 --> 48:23.900
The master don't see nobody,
especially no jive coolies.

48:24.068 --> 48:27.070
He don't see no one
who don't know how to get down, baby!

48:27.238 --> 48:30.115
- You dig, bro? You too square, man.
- Square, dude.

48:30.283 --> 48:33.451
Let me say it
so he can understand it, Jim.

48:36.205 --> 48:38.290
You go now. Chop-chop.

48:38.457 --> 48:41.084
"Haulee" ass out of this place.

48:41.252 --> 48:44.254
- Am I saying it right, my man?
- That's good. That's good.

48:44.422 --> 48:47.007
Like, <i>hasta la pasta</i>, you know?

48:47.174 --> 48:48.675
Ciao, baby.

48:48.843 --> 48:51.261
- Auf Wiedersehen, baby.
- Sayonara.

48:51.429 --> 48:54.097
- Catch you on the flip-flop.
- Sayonara.

48:56.517 --> 48:57.684
<i>I was told...</i>

48:57.852 --> 49:00.270
I could find Leroy Green here!

49:04.358 --> 49:06.985
I'm Leroy Green. Who are you?

49:09.155 --> 49:11.072
Who am I?

49:11.657 --> 49:13.450
Sho'nuff!

49:15.578 --> 49:19.247
I am the shogun of Harlem...

49:19.415 --> 49:22.042
and the Leroy Green I'm looking for...

49:22.209 --> 49:25.503
is a little punk that thinks
he's a kung fu master.

49:28.883 --> 49:31.676
- You mean Junior?
- Yeah.

49:32.345 --> 49:36.056
- "Junior." Where is he?
- "Junior"!

49:37.642 --> 49:41.269
Don't know.
Not sure I'd tell you if I did.

49:41.854 --> 49:44.564
- Not sure you'd tell me if you did?!
- Wait a minute!

49:44.732 --> 49:47.859
- Leave him alone!
- Please, Mama, hold it! Wait a minute!

49:48.027 --> 49:49.694
Hold it. I'll take care of it.

49:49.862 --> 49:52.822
Well, how about I leave him
a little message, then?!

49:53.783 --> 49:57.327
Tell him when I found out
he wasn't here...

49:57.495 --> 50:00.455
I was all broken up.

50:01.248 --> 50:03.917
Oh, my God, my table!
What are you doing?

50:07.213 --> 50:09.297
Crunch, Beast, Cyclone!

50:09.465 --> 50:10.965
- Do it!
- With pleasure.

50:11.133 --> 50:13.551
- No!
- Hold it, please, fellas! No, not that.

50:13.719 --> 50:16.054
- Please, don't do that!
- You stop it!

50:16.222 --> 50:18.306
Mama... The walls... My shop!

50:18.474 --> 50:20.058
Oh, God.

50:25.564 --> 50:27.565
Don't break the table!

50:27.733 --> 50:29.442
Go, go!

50:32.196 --> 50:35.073
- I'm gonna kill you!
- Take it easy, honey.

50:35.241 --> 50:37.242
What, are you crazy? He's the Beast.

50:37.410 --> 50:39.994
- She only hit you with dough!
- You gonna die!

50:40.162 --> 50:42.914
All right, enough is enough!
Y'all better chill out.

50:43.082 --> 50:46.376
- Richie, you stay out of this!
- You better chill out, man!

50:47.169 --> 50:49.045
I said, chill out!

50:50.673 --> 50:52.590
All right, take it easy!

50:52.758 --> 50:54.884
Please, take it easy.

51:04.812 --> 51:06.396
Tell...

51:09.275 --> 51:11.651
Who plays this garbage?

51:12.403 --> 51:14.446
Shut up, bitch!

51:15.239 --> 51:17.615
That's not even mine! I don't own that!

51:25.791 --> 51:28.752
Tell that chicken-hearted
son of yours...

51:28.919 --> 51:31.421
to name the place.

51:31.589 --> 51:34.007
Because now he's got to fight me.

51:40.139 --> 51:41.765
Yeah.

51:58.908 --> 52:00.742
Can I kick?

52:12.963 --> 52:17.091
- Come on. I got you.
- Oh, my God. Look at him.

52:17.259 --> 52:18.676
- Oh, my God.
- Sit down.

52:18.844 --> 52:20.261
You all right, Rich?

52:20.429 --> 52:23.348
You all right now?
Look at this. What the...?

52:32.608 --> 52:34.317
What happened?

52:34.819 --> 52:38.154
Sho'nuff happened, that's what.
And it's all because of you!

52:38.322 --> 52:40.365
Everyone knows you're scared of him.

52:40.533 --> 52:42.992
Kissed his shoes and everything.

52:43.160 --> 52:46.454
What good is that kung fu jive
if you can't even use it?

52:46.622 --> 52:48.248
Coward.

52:49.625 --> 52:52.627
Why don't you go someplace
and meditate on that?

53:17.987 --> 53:19.737
<i>Coward.</i>

53:22.950 --> 53:24.617
<i>Coward.</i>

53:26.912 --> 53:28.705
<i>Coward.</i>

53:33.711 --> 53:35.879
Chinese GoJu is my secret!

53:36.046 --> 53:39.382
May God help me
if I ever have to use my art!

53:39.550 --> 53:41.175
Love is our law!

53:41.343 --> 53:43.511
Truth is our worship!

53:43.679 --> 53:45.555
Form is our manifestation!

53:45.723 --> 53:48.391
Conscience is our guide!

53:50.019 --> 53:52.020
Peace is our shelter.

53:54.940 --> 53:58.192
Peace is my shelter.

54:00.279 --> 54:02.363
Peace is my shelter.

54:04.617 --> 54:06.409
Have to use...

54:17.171 --> 54:18.212
Hello?

54:19.882 --> 54:20.882
Hey.

54:23.469 --> 54:25.303
I don't mean to bother you, but...

54:26.263 --> 54:29.349
maybe I should just come back
another time, huh?

54:31.101 --> 54:34.270
Listen, if this is a bad time,
you know, I can just...

54:37.441 --> 54:41.110
Do you know, the strangest things
keep happening to me.

54:41.278 --> 54:46.157
I mean, I seem to be attracting
the craziest people.

54:46.325 --> 54:49.619
So I thought that maybe
it would be a great idea...

54:49.787 --> 54:52.038
if I got myself a bodyguard...

54:52.206 --> 54:53.873
you know?

54:54.041 --> 54:58.044
Like, someone to guard my body.

54:59.964 --> 55:03.091
Anyway, you seem to be
the best qualified. I mean...

55:03.968 --> 55:08.429
a girl could do worse than to have
her own real, live kung-fu master.

55:08.931 --> 55:11.015
I am no master.

55:14.520 --> 55:17.230
You sure look like a master to me.

55:23.278 --> 55:24.278
How about it?

55:25.197 --> 55:26.197
How about what?

55:27.408 --> 55:28.533
Bodyguard.

55:28.701 --> 55:30.868
- Hello?
- Bodyguard?

55:31.036 --> 55:33.329
Yeah, I want you to be my bodyguard.

55:33.497 --> 55:36.290
- Have you heard anything?
- There is much I must do.

55:36.458 --> 55:38.459
I am sorry. I cannot.

55:38.627 --> 55:40.795
Leroy! Leroy!

55:42.131 --> 55:44.173
Yo. Excuse me.

55:44.758 --> 55:47.260
- That's okay.
- Say...

55:47.970 --> 55:49.387
you're Laura Charles.

55:50.806 --> 55:52.598
Forget it. I will go. Don't...

55:52.766 --> 55:54.726
- That's okay.
- I won't bother you.

55:54.893 --> 55:58.021
- It's okay, I was just leaving.
- Leaving?

55:58.188 --> 56:01.107
Please, just give it some thought, okay?

56:01.900 --> 56:05.445
Laura Charles. Laura Charles.

56:05.612 --> 56:08.364
Just let me know
if you change your mind.

56:08.532 --> 56:11.159
I said, I cannot help you.

56:11.326 --> 56:14.412
He can't help you?
Of course he can help you.

56:14.580 --> 56:18.249
Look at that, he's just... That's hot.
He's sick. The boy's...

56:18.417 --> 56:21.461
All that yoga. Hi, my name is Johnny Yu.

56:21.628 --> 56:26.132
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Hi, Johnny, it's nice to meet you.

56:30.387 --> 56:33.431
She said it was nice to meet me.

56:33.599 --> 56:36.184
Laura Charles said
it was nice to meet me!

56:36.351 --> 56:38.853
She said it was nice!

56:39.021 --> 56:40.480
She...

56:41.607 --> 56:43.107
Yeah.

56:44.943 --> 56:49.030
- This is your rÃ©sumÃ©?
- I like the cropping on that picture.

56:50.074 --> 56:51.949
You did the incinerator murder?

56:52.117 --> 56:56.329
Yeah. Yeah, I trashed the little lady.

57:05.380 --> 57:06.839
Double?

57:10.010 --> 57:12.095
Why should you get double...

57:12.262 --> 57:14.722
what everybody else is getting, huh?

57:19.144 --> 57:20.770
Beautiful! Beautiful!

57:20.938 --> 57:22.897
Save it! Save it.

57:23.065 --> 57:26.818
Give that man anything he wants.
Give him a bone.

57:28.112 --> 57:30.196
Make sure you take out for the table.

57:57.307 --> 57:59.016
All right, that's enough.

57:59.184 --> 58:01.102
- Looks terrific, sweetheart.
- Yeah?

58:01.270 --> 58:04.689
Just needs a couple more steps.
And you girls looked great too.

58:04.857 --> 58:07.859
Why don't you take a break
and get out of those clothes?

58:08.026 --> 58:09.610
Here are some quarters.

58:09.778 --> 58:11.946
- Go have a good time. Come on.
- Yeah.

58:12.114 --> 58:13.698
- Go, go, go.
- Bye, girls!

58:13.866 --> 58:16.033
- Bye, baby.
- Ciao, Angie, baby.

58:16.201 --> 58:21.414
You know, to tell you the truth, Eddie,
I'm really getting tired of all this.

58:21.582 --> 58:26.377
I mean, that deejay lady,
she's never gonna play our stuff anyway.

58:26.545 --> 58:27.795
She'll see the light...

58:27.963 --> 58:30.882
as soon as I get
that Leroy character out of the way.

58:33.385 --> 58:35.219
What do you mean, "out of the way"?

58:35.387 --> 58:39.348
Sweetheart, you should see
the talent I got lined up out there.

58:39.516 --> 58:43.477
If this deejay broad don't wise up,
she's gonna be dessert.

58:43.645 --> 58:45.813
And it's all for you, sweetheart.

58:46.231 --> 58:48.274
All to make you a star.

58:48.442 --> 58:50.985
Now what do you think
of your lover boy, huh?

58:51.153 --> 58:53.154
All for me?

58:53.322 --> 58:55.114
All for you, sweetheart.

58:55.866 --> 58:59.827
Well, I mean,
if it's really all for me...

59:01.872 --> 59:04.624
Oh, I don't want you to kill anybody.

59:05.209 --> 59:07.043
Are you out of your mind?!

59:07.211 --> 59:10.254
Nobody does what he did to me
and lives! Nobody!

59:16.011 --> 59:18.888
You know what I've been thinking, Eddie?

59:19.056 --> 59:22.683
I think that maybe you're trying
to use me to get what you want.

59:24.102 --> 59:27.396
I mean, just like you tried to use Rock.

59:27.564 --> 59:31.359
Yeah, you were gonna make him
this big heavyweight champion.

59:31.526 --> 59:34.654
Sure. Sure, until he lost a fight.

59:34.821 --> 59:37.990
All this glamour and stardom...

59:38.533 --> 59:40.701
it's all for you, isn't it, Eddie?

59:45.916 --> 59:47.750
You know, Angie...

59:48.961 --> 59:52.546
a lot of girls out there would like
to trade places with you.

59:53.632 --> 59:58.427
Now, if you're unhappy with all of this,
why don't you just walk out?

01:00:00.055 --> 01:00:03.599
Go have a nice, normal, boring life.

01:00:06.395 --> 01:00:09.313
To tell you the truth,
it couldn't be any more boring...

01:00:09.481 --> 01:00:11.607
than hanging around here...

01:00:11.775 --> 01:00:14.110
while you guys go play cops and robbers.

01:00:14.278 --> 01:00:16.404
Where you gonna go, Angie?

01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:17.989
Without me, you're nothing!

01:00:18.156 --> 01:00:21.784
Without that outfit, you're just
another no-talent, school dropout...

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:25.037
from Kew Gardens getting by on her tits!

01:00:28.792 --> 01:00:31.544
And in the end, Eddie, you know what?

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:35.673
You're nothing but a misguided,
midget asshole...

01:00:35.841 --> 01:00:38.509
with dreams of ruling the world!

01:00:39.970 --> 01:00:43.472
Yeah, also from Kew Gardens.

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.979
And also getting by on my tits.

01:00:54.067 --> 01:00:55.818
Where do you think you're going?!

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:58.279
To elocution class!

01:00:59.990 --> 01:01:01.115
What for?

01:01:15.422 --> 01:01:17.340
- Kill him!
- Yeah!

01:01:22.846 --> 01:01:25.014
Get that son of a...

01:01:27.642 --> 01:01:29.643
- Yeah!
- Did you see that?!

01:01:29.811 --> 01:01:32.355
Sho'nuff is the master!

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.648
Sho'nuff! Sho'nuff!

01:01:34.816 --> 01:01:36.817
- Number one!
- Can I pick them or what?

01:01:36.985 --> 01:01:37.985
Shut up!

01:01:38.153 --> 01:01:40.863
- Am I the meanest?!
- Sho'nuff!

01:01:41.031 --> 01:01:43.657
- Am I the prettiest?
- Sho'nuff!

01:01:43.825 --> 01:01:47.370
Am I the baddest mofo
lowdown around this town?

01:01:47.537 --> 01:01:48.662
Sho'nuff!

01:01:48.830 --> 01:01:50.456
I can't hear you!

01:01:50.624 --> 01:01:52.208
Sho'nuff!

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:53.876
Yeah.

01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:59.965
<i>Sho'nuff! Sho'nuff! Sho'nuff!</i>

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:04.929
Keep your money.

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:08.808
You just get that sucker
to the designated place...

01:02:08.975 --> 01:02:10.643
at the designated time...

01:02:11.436 --> 01:02:14.522
and I will gladly designate his ass...

01:02:14.689 --> 01:02:17.024
for dismemberment.

01:02:17.192 --> 01:02:19.985
Yeah. Hey. Well, whatever.

01:02:20.153 --> 01:02:21.946
Anyway you wanna do it.

01:02:22.114 --> 01:02:24.990
It'll certainly be my pleasure,
Mr. Nuff.

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:31.747
Put it away. Come on.

01:02:46.138 --> 01:02:47.638
- Looking for me?
- Yes.

01:02:47.806 --> 01:02:49.348
I mean...

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:52.685
I thought I wasn't exactly
on your favorite persons' list.

01:02:52.853 --> 01:02:56.021
That is why I came by,
to apologize for the way I spoke.

01:02:56.189 --> 01:02:58.524
I did not mean it towards you.

01:02:58.692 --> 01:03:00.067
Great.

01:03:00.235 --> 01:03:02.319
Then you'll be my bodyguard?

01:03:02.487 --> 01:03:05.656
I'd love to, but I must complete
a mission first.

01:03:06.658 --> 01:03:08.033
A mission?

01:03:08.201 --> 01:03:09.493
You see...

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:13.247
I am in search of the final level
where the spirit takes over...

01:03:13.415 --> 01:03:16.834
from the mind and guides
the body without thought.

01:03:17.002 --> 01:03:20.588
Okay. Listen, you stay right here, okay?

01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:22.965
Don't move.
I'll be back in five minutes.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:25.718
Don't disappear, okay?
I'll be right back.

01:03:25.886 --> 01:03:27.553
<i>A great fighter, for instance...</i>

01:03:27.721 --> 01:03:30.681
might get just his hands
to fill with such power...

01:03:30.849 --> 01:03:34.727
that they would get the glow,
which could be deadly in evil hands.

01:03:34.895 --> 01:03:37.521
Yet, if these hands belonged
to a master...

01:03:37.689 --> 01:03:39.064
Like Bruce Lee.

01:03:39.232 --> 01:03:40.483
Yes, exactly!

01:03:40.650 --> 01:03:44.820
...someone who has reached the final level
and could make his whole body glow...

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:49.116
the beauty he would be able
to create would be without bounds.

01:03:49.951 --> 01:03:53.829
Imagine the wonder someone like this
can bring to the world.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.041
That's a beautiful dream, Leroy.

01:03:57.209 --> 01:04:01.003
Now, I know you're gonna love
what I've got to show you at the studio.

01:04:02.881 --> 01:04:04.465
What's wrong?

01:04:05.717 --> 01:04:07.760
Calling Leroy.

01:04:09.012 --> 01:04:11.597
I am sorry, but it's just...

01:04:12.474 --> 01:04:14.642
What? Tell me. Come on.

01:04:15.977 --> 01:04:17.853
You see, I have this friend.

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:20.189
- Yeah?
- And he is very shy.

01:04:20.774 --> 01:04:22.483
And he came to me for advice.

01:04:22.651 --> 01:04:25.277
And I, well...

01:04:27.113 --> 01:04:30.741
It is something I thought
you can help me with... Him with.

01:04:32.661 --> 01:04:35.496
Okay, I'll try.
Tell me about it. What is it?

01:04:37.165 --> 01:04:38.207
Moves.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:40.793
Moves?

01:04:43.046 --> 01:04:44.213
You see...

01:04:44.381 --> 01:04:47.508
my friend, he has never been...

01:04:47.676 --> 01:04:49.426
- He likes this girl.
- Yeah?

01:04:49.594 --> 01:04:52.012
But he has never been
with a woman before.

01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:54.932
He does not even have a paintbrush.

01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:56.267
Paintbrush?

01:04:56.434 --> 01:04:58.227
He cannot even draw.

01:04:58.395 --> 01:05:01.397
- Draw? What are you talking about?
- You know.

01:05:01.565 --> 01:05:03.732
The art of making love.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.236
- Moves.
- Oh, of course.

01:05:08.196 --> 01:05:10.573
- I'd love to show you some moves.
- No, no, no.

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:13.117
It's not for me.
I said, it is for my friend.

01:05:13.285 --> 01:05:15.202
He is the one.

01:05:15.787 --> 01:05:18.289
Okay, anything you say.

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:28.716
Is it not kind of hot in here,
Miss Charles?

01:05:28.883 --> 01:05:33.137
I'm telling you, I don't need a contest
to win this date because I got juice.

01:05:33.305 --> 01:05:34.763
Why don't you just give up?

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:38.601
Your delusions of grandeur about love
with her is just a wet dream.

01:05:38.768 --> 01:05:40.603
Don't be no fool, Jack.

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:43.606
Baron Von Rick's got
a more direct route to the target.

01:05:43.773 --> 01:05:45.941
Watch out the target
don't shoot you down.

01:05:46.109 --> 01:05:49.236
- Why not write her a letter?
- Or make an obscene phone call?

01:05:49.404 --> 01:05:51.739
Because that's as close
as you're gonna get.

01:05:51.906 --> 01:05:53.824
You two play a game if you want to.

01:05:53.992 --> 01:05:57.244
I'm gonna sit right here
and wait for her to show up.

01:05:57.412 --> 01:05:59.538
And the rap I'm gonna lay on her...

01:05:59.706 --> 01:06:02.333
is gonna make Romeo seem tongue-tied.

01:06:02.500 --> 01:06:06.754
Make her melt like hot butter
all over my body!

01:06:06.921 --> 01:06:07.921
Go, Rick.

01:06:08.089 --> 01:06:11.258
Ain't nothing gonna stand
between me and my destiny...

01:06:11.426 --> 01:06:14.261
with the sweet lips of Lady Laura.

01:06:15.555 --> 01:06:17.681
This place is great.

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:49.922
<i>Fists of Fury!</i>

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:50.149
That's it, man. Enough is enough.

01:07:50.316 --> 01:07:52.526
- I'm gonna go.
- Wait a minute! Wait!

01:07:52.694 --> 01:07:54.445
Something's going on in here.

01:07:54.612 --> 01:07:56.363
You think it's her?

01:07:56.948 --> 01:07:59.533
There's only one way to find out.
Come on!

01:07:59.701 --> 01:08:01.452
What? Where are we going?

01:08:06.416 --> 01:08:07.916
Shit!

01:08:08.543 --> 01:08:11.003
- Hey. Wait up, man! Wait up!
- Forget it, man.

01:08:41.326 --> 01:08:43.076
This is great!

01:09:38.299 --> 01:09:41.926
I ought to slap that sucker with a suit
for alienation of affections!

01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:44.805
If it wasn't for me,
he wouldn't know where she was!

01:09:44.973 --> 01:09:47.640
- Chocolate-covered yellow peril!
- Chill out, man!

01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:50.853
Wait for me, will you?
Come on, man, wait for me!

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:53.939
That sucker better start sleeping
with one eye open.

01:09:54.107 --> 01:09:58.318
There's gonna be a serious case
of chop-socky justice coming his way.

01:09:58.486 --> 01:10:00.404
Maybe you just don't understand him.

01:10:00.572 --> 01:10:03.240
If she likes him,
he must be doing something right.

01:10:03.408 --> 01:10:05.784
Leroy wouldn't even know
what to do with that.

01:10:05.952 --> 01:10:08.078
Looked like he was
doing all right to me.

01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:20.215
What's that?

01:10:23.344 --> 01:10:24.636
<i>Chinese Connection.</i>

01:10:24.804 --> 01:10:29.057
He has disguised himself
in order to get...

01:10:32.687 --> 01:10:35.314
Get into the villains' lair!

01:10:39.027 --> 01:10:41.862
Why did I not think of that before?

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:44.615
I must go.

01:10:51.247 --> 01:10:53.457
Thanks a lot, Bruce!

01:11:01.966 --> 01:11:05.594
- Where are you going?
- Back to claim what's mine!

01:11:12.143 --> 01:11:13.894
Leroy?

01:11:15.396 --> 01:11:16.688
Ran out on you, huh?

01:11:17.649 --> 01:11:20.067
Don't cover up
for that Ping-Pong playing...

01:11:20.234 --> 01:11:22.653
chow mein for brains, kung fu head!

01:11:22.820 --> 01:11:24.321
What are you doing up there?

01:11:24.489 --> 01:11:27.449
You come down here
before you hurt yourself!

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:31.078
Now. Now.

01:11:31.245 --> 01:11:33.914
I don't understand what you see in him!

01:11:37.168 --> 01:11:38.168
Leroy?

01:11:42.632 --> 01:11:44.967
We meet again, Miss Charles.

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:49.721
No!

01:11:50.348 --> 01:11:52.349
Let me go!

01:11:53.977 --> 01:11:56.520
Get your hands off my woman!

01:11:57.981 --> 01:12:00.482
I said, get your hands off my woman!

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:04.111
Let me go, you big baboon!

01:12:07.657 --> 01:12:09.366
All right!

01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:12.369
Little Joe, man! You pay up, bro!

01:12:12.537 --> 01:12:15.205
This is craps, man! You pay me!

01:12:15.373 --> 01:12:18.709
Hey, man, you blind, man?
The book says "Little Joe"!

01:12:18.876 --> 01:12:22.713
- You pay up, blood.
- You can't even read the book, blood.

01:12:25.842 --> 01:12:28.343
Hey, my man.

01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:31.471
What it look like? No.

01:12:31.639 --> 01:12:34.808
Hey, my man, what it look like?

01:12:39.022 --> 01:12:41.982
Hey, my man, what it look like?

01:12:46.863 --> 01:12:48.530
Hey, my man.

01:12:48.698 --> 01:12:50.699
- What it look like?
- What you want?

01:12:50.867 --> 01:12:52.993
I am the soul brother like no other...

01:12:53.161 --> 01:12:55.620
to deliver this pizza with bean sprouts.

01:12:55.788 --> 01:12:57.789
Pizza with bean sprouts?

01:12:57.957 --> 01:13:00.333
Yeah, we make anything, dig?

01:13:00.501 --> 01:13:04.921
Just direct-a your feets-a
to Daddy Green's pizza.

01:13:05.882 --> 01:13:09.426
Now, if you bloods would show me
where I can find the master...

01:13:09.594 --> 01:13:13.096
You sure the master ordered this pizza?

01:13:15.308 --> 01:13:16.683
The man himself.

01:13:16.851 --> 01:13:19.936
You're going to release his beast
if it gets cold out here.

01:13:20.104 --> 01:13:22.689
Buddy, I'm gonna rip your face off.

01:13:22.857 --> 01:13:26.026
- No, no. Wait, wait, wait! It's okay.
- "Okay"?

01:13:27.236 --> 01:13:29.738
You the same fool
that came dressed as a coolie?

01:13:29.906 --> 01:13:32.657
No, no, no. We all just look alike.

01:13:32.825 --> 01:13:35.202
My man. Brother.

01:13:35.369 --> 01:13:36.369
"My man."

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:40.165
Yo, bro!

01:13:41.918 --> 01:13:46.379
My man, the master, he split, you know?

01:13:46.547 --> 01:13:48.590
- Split?
- Yeah, he's not here.

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:50.675
So why don't you chill out with us?

01:13:50.843 --> 01:13:53.720
Smoke a little herb.
Sip a little wine, huh?

01:13:53.888 --> 01:13:56.973
Oh, no, I had too much already.

01:13:57.141 --> 01:13:59.101
Soul brother!

01:13:59.268 --> 01:14:00.936
- Soul brother!
- All right.

01:14:01.104 --> 01:14:03.271
You know how to shoot craps?

01:14:03.439 --> 01:14:05.273
- Craps?
- Craps!

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:07.400
Craps!

01:14:08.611 --> 01:14:10.612
Oh, yeah, craps.

01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:12.823
- All right!
- All right!

01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:14.241
Right on!

01:14:15.118 --> 01:14:17.202
Mr. Leroy?

01:14:21.124 --> 01:14:23.750
Mr. Leroy?

01:14:27.630 --> 01:14:29.464
Are you in here?

01:14:34.428 --> 01:14:38.014
Sorry, miss, I didn't mean
to scare you that bad.

01:14:38.182 --> 01:14:40.058
Oh, that's all right.

01:14:40.643 --> 01:14:42.602
Is Mr. Leroy here?

01:14:44.272 --> 01:14:47.023
No, he's not here, but...

01:14:47.191 --> 01:14:50.026
how about something
in a medium-sized Oriental?

01:14:50.194 --> 01:14:52.320
No, thanks.

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:53.822
I'm not Jewish.

01:15:00.746 --> 01:15:03.206
Is this where he does all that stuff?

01:15:03.374 --> 01:15:05.458
Oh, yeah, I do it too.

01:15:11.549 --> 01:15:13.592
Oh, that's really wonderful!

01:15:14.468 --> 01:15:16.011
Yep.

01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:20.182
Well, you see, I'm on my way back to...

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:21.558
Kew Gardens.

01:15:32.153 --> 01:15:35.030
You gotta tell Mr. Leroy that...

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:38.867
he better stay away from Seventh Heaven.

01:15:39.493 --> 01:15:41.203
Why?

01:15:43.623 --> 01:15:48.251
Because of my former producer,
associate...

01:15:49.587 --> 01:15:52.797
and boyfriend, Eddie Arkadian.

01:15:55.384 --> 01:15:57.427
He's gone crazy.

01:15:57.595 --> 01:15:59.221
Tonight's show is conceived...

01:15:59.388 --> 01:16:03.141
written, produced, directed
and starring...

01:16:03.309 --> 01:16:05.393
Eddie Arkadian!

01:16:05.561 --> 01:16:09.397
Tonight, we make show-biz history...

01:16:09.565 --> 01:16:11.775
my way!

01:16:16.781 --> 01:16:22.535
We're getting funky to the smooth,
cool sounds of Fast Eddie A!

01:16:33.422 --> 01:16:35.131
What's that?

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:37.133
Fire.

01:16:54.819 --> 01:16:56.361
Who is she?

01:16:56.529 --> 01:16:57.946
Charlene.

01:17:03.494 --> 01:17:05.078
She got a manager?

01:17:06.038 --> 01:17:07.497
I don't know.

01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:10.750
Fire!

01:17:11.836 --> 01:17:15.839
This is sure one strange game of craps,
soul brother.

01:17:16.007 --> 01:17:17.841
- Oh, yeah.
- Hey.

01:17:18.009 --> 01:17:19.759
This is how we play in Harlem.

01:17:19.927 --> 01:17:22.304
You want to play
like soul brother number-one?

01:17:22.471 --> 01:17:25.181
- Yeah! Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah.

01:17:25.349 --> 01:17:28.935
- You play like this.
- All right, I'm sorry.

01:17:29.103 --> 01:17:30.687
Now it is your turn.

01:17:30.855 --> 01:17:32.814
- Do not step on the line.
- Right.

01:17:32.982 --> 01:17:34.649
My man.

01:17:36.027 --> 01:17:37.777
- Right on!
- Right on.

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:40.322
- Nine.
- That's nine.

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:43.658
Two, three, five. Right?

01:17:45.328 --> 01:17:46.578
Turkey!

01:17:46.746 --> 01:17:49.789
- Oh, shit.
- You turkey.

01:17:49.957 --> 01:17:52.042
What time is it?

01:17:53.127 --> 01:17:55.920
- Where is the master?
- "Master"?

01:17:56.088 --> 01:17:59.549
Looks like my man
forgot about his pizza.

01:18:00.134 --> 01:18:02.302
- I must see him now.
- No, no, no.

01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:05.638
The wise one never sees nobody.

01:18:06.140 --> 01:18:07.766
He will see me.

01:18:07.933 --> 01:18:10.185
- I have this.
- What you got?

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:12.896
Hey, check this out!

01:18:14.023 --> 01:18:16.441
It's nice. I like that.

01:18:21.947 --> 01:18:23.782
Okay, here, come with me.

01:18:23.949 --> 01:18:25.367
I will see him now?

01:18:25.534 --> 01:18:27.911
- Yeah, come on. Sure.
- Yeah.

01:18:32.917 --> 01:18:34.959
Just wait here.

01:18:49.809 --> 01:18:51.893
Where is the master?!

01:18:52.395 --> 01:18:53.728
I want to see him now!

01:18:53.896 --> 01:18:56.564
Please, please, please!
There is no master!

01:18:56.732 --> 01:18:58.108
- You lie!
- No, it's true!

01:18:58.275 --> 01:19:00.568
We made him up
to sell more fortune cookies!

01:19:00.736 --> 01:19:02.028
- Tell him!
- It's true.

01:19:02.196 --> 01:19:05.365
- Please! I'll show you!
- Show him.

01:19:05.533 --> 01:19:08.243
- Over here. I'll show you.
- Yeah, show him!

01:19:08.411 --> 01:19:10.537
Show him, show him!

01:19:14.166 --> 01:19:16.334
This is Sum Dum Goy.

01:19:38.983 --> 01:19:41.860
Why?! Why, master?

01:19:42.361 --> 01:19:45.989
Why have you sent me on a journey
to find someone who does not exist?

01:19:46.157 --> 01:19:47.449
Why?

01:19:47.616 --> 01:19:51.494
So you have not found
the master that you seek.

01:19:51.662 --> 01:19:54.456
There is no Sum Dum Goy.

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:57.125
He is a computer.

01:19:58.794 --> 01:20:01.421
Why have you done this to me?

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:15.018
Here.

01:20:15.186 --> 01:20:17.645
It contains everything you need...

01:20:17.813 --> 01:20:20.106
to find your way to the golden glow.

01:20:30.034 --> 01:20:31.493
Think, Leroy.

01:20:31.660 --> 01:20:34.829
You have just opened a fortune cookie
without a fortune...

01:20:34.997 --> 01:20:37.707
written by a master
who does not exist...

01:20:37.875 --> 01:20:39.876
to find the solution to a problem...

01:20:40.044 --> 01:20:42.837
whose answer you already know.

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:44.839
And this?

01:20:47.927 --> 01:20:49.761
You needed a charm.

01:20:49.929 --> 01:20:53.431
A true master would use this
to hold up his pants.

01:20:59.855 --> 01:21:01.314
Enough.

01:21:01.857 --> 01:21:05.652
There is one place
that you have not yet looked.

01:21:05.819 --> 01:21:08.571
And it is there, only there...

01:21:08.739 --> 01:21:11.866
that you shall find the master.

01:21:12.785 --> 01:21:17.330
Now, if you will excuse me,
my plane leaves shortly.

01:21:19.333 --> 01:21:22.168
You are going on a quest for knowledge?

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:26.464
No, I'm going to visit my mother
in Miami.

01:21:30.010 --> 01:21:31.803
Leroy! Leroy!

01:21:31.971 --> 01:21:34.430
Are you actually gonna fight them?

01:21:34.598 --> 01:21:37.976
Well, you... You can't be serious!

01:21:38.143 --> 01:21:43.398
Leroy, I never would've told you
if I thought you'd actually go there.

01:21:43.983 --> 01:21:45.900
Oh, what are you, nuts?

01:21:47.486 --> 01:21:49.696
You're not going all alone, are you?

01:21:49.863 --> 01:21:51.281
Are you?

01:21:51.907 --> 01:21:54.617
All right, then.
Then I'm going with you.

01:21:54.785 --> 01:21:57.078
If you go, I go!

01:21:57.246 --> 01:21:58.871
Okay.

01:22:00.583 --> 01:22:02.166
Okay?

01:22:02.793 --> 01:22:05.253
Do you plan to fight
with only your bare hands?

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:07.088
Do you not need a weapon?

01:22:07.256 --> 01:22:09.090
Weapon, right!

01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:13.094
Hey! Hey, Leroy!

01:22:13.262 --> 01:22:15.805
What are you doing?
This isn't funny, Leroy!

01:22:15.973 --> 01:22:18.224
Johnny, I am sorry.

01:22:18.392 --> 01:22:20.435
I must do this alone.

01:22:20.603 --> 01:22:23.479
Leroy? Leroy, come back here!

01:22:23.647 --> 01:22:25.940
Leroy, come back here!

01:22:26.108 --> 01:22:29.652
Leroy! I'm afraid of the dark!

01:22:48.172 --> 01:22:49.631
Leroy.

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:52.133
Leroy! Leroy!

01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:53.468
- Gag her!
- Right, boss.

01:23:06.732 --> 01:23:08.107
Come on!

01:23:08.275 --> 01:23:11.319
The key. Wait. Okay!

01:23:11.487 --> 01:23:13.988
Put the key in the latch and turn it!

01:23:14.531 --> 01:23:16.699
- Okay, I'm trying!
- Well, try harder!

01:23:16.867 --> 01:23:18.493
Okay!

01:23:18.661 --> 01:23:20.662
Okay, you can come out now!

01:23:22.331 --> 01:23:23.581
Come on, let's go!

01:23:23.749 --> 01:23:27.210
Where are we going?
We already missed the second show.

01:23:27.378 --> 01:23:29.629
- Would you just come on?
- Okay!

01:23:55.197 --> 01:23:57.323
<i>Leroy!</i>

01:23:59.576 --> 01:24:00.910
<i>Leroy!</i>

01:24:09.253 --> 01:24:10.586
<i>Welcome...</i>

01:24:10.754 --> 01:24:15.341
<i>to my little party in your honor, Leroy.</i>

01:24:20.681 --> 01:24:23.015
<i>The guest list has been compiled...</i>

01:24:23.183 --> 01:24:26.310
<i>so that you go out in style.</i>

01:24:31.316 --> 01:24:36.529
<i>You don't mind if my friends
introduce themselves, do you, Leroy?</i>

01:24:37.406 --> 01:24:40.533
<i>Then let the games...</i>

01:24:40.701 --> 01:24:42.910
<i>begin!</i>

01:24:55.883 --> 01:24:58.134
Bravo, Leroy!

01:24:58.302 --> 01:25:01.304
I'm gonna whack this guy
and get it over with now!

01:25:01.472 --> 01:25:02.805
Give me that thing!

01:25:02.973 --> 01:25:05.808
Goddamn it, take that off!
I said, take it off!

01:25:05.976 --> 01:25:09.437
You gotta ruin everything!
The time, money, the energy I've spent!

01:25:09.605 --> 01:25:12.106
Get it off! Get the broad!

01:25:12.941 --> 01:25:15.026
Attaboy, Leroy!

01:25:15.194 --> 01:25:17.361
You're a bunch of wusses, you know that?

01:25:18.280 --> 01:25:20.072
More volume!

01:25:26.205 --> 01:25:27.914
All right!

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:31.459
Way to go, Goliath!

01:25:39.551 --> 01:25:42.428
Go for it, boys! Give him a lick!

01:26:15.128 --> 01:26:16.754
Go, Johnny!

01:26:23.846 --> 01:26:26.264
Come on! Will you make it interesting?

01:26:28.058 --> 01:26:30.017
Good! That's one for you!

01:26:31.728 --> 01:26:33.604
Johnny! Are you all right?

01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:37.066
Oh, shit!

01:26:49.121 --> 01:26:51.873
- Come on! Come on, young buck!
- Who, me?

01:26:54.877 --> 01:26:56.085
Johnny!

01:26:56.253 --> 01:26:58.754
Come on, you miserable slob!

01:26:58.922 --> 01:27:00.381
God, what a slug!

01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:34.916
You got it, Johnny!

01:27:50.641 --> 01:27:53.476
Move out. Come on. Plan B.
Let's go! Move out! Come on.

01:27:54.686 --> 01:27:56.395
Let's get the hell out of here!

01:27:56.563 --> 01:27:57.772
Go, go, go.

01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:00.107
- Come on, will you?
- Move it. Move!

01:28:00.275 --> 01:28:01.859
Come on.

01:28:02.027 --> 01:28:03.319
Come on.

01:28:12.287 --> 01:28:13.746
Leroy!

01:28:13.914 --> 01:28:15.623
This way!

01:29:08.927 --> 01:29:10.428
Hey, Leroy!

01:29:10.595 --> 01:29:13.431
That was almost worth
the price of admission in there!

01:29:13.598 --> 01:29:17.309
And to think,
the featured act is yet to come!

01:29:18.520 --> 01:29:21.105
Come on, Leroy!

01:29:34.828 --> 01:29:37.747
Bozo, you go that way. Just go.

01:29:38.707 --> 01:29:39.915
Come on, come on.

01:30:12.282 --> 01:30:13.532
Holy shit.

01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:17.661
Let her go, or next time
I will not miss.

01:30:22.626 --> 01:30:25.461
Next time, I won't miss either!

01:30:31.843 --> 01:30:33.636
Got you now, you little punk.

01:30:42.771 --> 01:30:45.106
You'll never use that again!

01:30:56.118 --> 01:30:59.578
- Come on.
- Leroy! Let me go!

01:30:59.746 --> 01:31:01.288
- Get off me!
- Leroy!

01:31:01.456 --> 01:31:02.832
Let him go.

01:31:02.999 --> 01:31:04.792
Anything you say!

01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:08.963
Richie.

01:31:32.154 --> 01:31:33.654
Richie.

01:31:34.865 --> 01:31:35.906
Richie.

01:31:36.074 --> 01:31:37.199
Let me at him.

01:31:37.367 --> 01:31:40.578
- Let me at him. I'll save you, Laura!
- Are you all right?

01:31:42.831 --> 01:31:45.040
Of course I'm all right.

01:31:48.378 --> 01:31:49.712
I gotta save Laura.

01:31:49.880 --> 01:31:52.339
You are not going anywhere.

01:31:53.717 --> 01:31:55.134
- Leroy, I wanna help!
- No.

01:31:55.302 --> 01:31:58.679
- I've got to save Laura!
- You'll be safe here.

01:31:58.847 --> 01:32:01.682
Leroy, I gotta save Laura!

01:32:01.850 --> 01:32:05.060
I was doing all right
till the guy got the drop on me!

01:32:05.228 --> 01:32:06.645
Leroy!

01:32:06.813 --> 01:32:09.607
Leroy! Come on, man!

01:32:09.774 --> 01:32:11.233
Leroy!

01:32:11.401 --> 01:32:14.111
You warmed up yet?

01:32:18.450 --> 01:32:19.617
Yeah.

01:32:19.784 --> 01:32:22.161
Come on, Leroy, let me out!

01:32:22.329 --> 01:32:24.121
Leroy!

01:32:24.289 --> 01:32:25.873
Be careful.

01:32:27.584 --> 01:32:31.629
There's nothing like this on stage,
screen, radio, TV, or cable, baby!

01:32:31.796 --> 01:32:33.172
This is an exclusive!

01:32:55.403 --> 01:32:58.113
Get him, get him! Come on, hit him!

01:33:00.825 --> 01:33:02.368
There, nigga, please!

01:33:08.375 --> 01:33:10.709
Duck, Leroy!
You can't do that to my brother!

01:33:10.877 --> 01:33:12.294
- Get him, Leroy!
- Yeah.

01:33:15.423 --> 01:33:17.675
That's the way! Get him, Leroy! Get him!

01:33:26.601 --> 01:33:29.603
All right, come on.

01:33:40.115 --> 01:33:42.616
Stings a little, don't it?

01:33:58.341 --> 01:34:00.426
Come on, Leroy.

01:34:00.593 --> 01:34:02.469
You can run, but you can't hide.

01:34:37.547 --> 01:34:38.922
Leroy!

01:35:00.987 --> 01:35:02.237
Yeah.

01:35:05.825 --> 01:35:07.910
Playtime's over, boy.

01:35:14.167 --> 01:35:15.918
Yeah.

01:35:23.218 --> 01:35:26.428
Ain't this beautiful, huh?
I love it. I love it.

01:35:26.596 --> 01:35:27.930
This is theater!

01:35:44.656 --> 01:35:46.156
Now...

01:35:46.324 --> 01:35:48.200
when I say:

01:35:48.368 --> 01:35:50.661
"Who's the master?"...

01:35:50.829 --> 01:35:52.746
you say:

01:35:52.914 --> 01:35:55.249
"Sho'nuff."

01:35:58.002 --> 01:36:00.129
Who's the master?

01:36:14.144 --> 01:36:16.812
We need a better view.
Come on, ringside seats!

01:36:29.451 --> 01:36:33.203
Now, I'm gonna ask you one more time.

01:36:35.832 --> 01:36:38.208
Who is the master, huh?

01:36:43.923 --> 01:36:45.674
Wait a minute, sweetheart! Wait.

01:36:50.722 --> 01:36:52.389
I love you. You stay here.

01:36:52.932 --> 01:36:56.101
Who's the master?!

01:36:56.269 --> 01:36:57.728
I can't hear you, Leroy!

01:36:57.896 --> 01:37:00.856
Drown him, for Christ's sake!
Will you drown him?!

01:37:03.693 --> 01:37:06.612
Who is the master?!

01:37:09.616 --> 01:37:11.658
I said, who's the master?!

01:37:14.037 --> 01:37:15.704
I can't hear you.

01:37:15.872 --> 01:37:18.624
Who is the master?!

01:37:22.045 --> 01:37:25.297
There is one place
that you have not looked.

01:37:25.465 --> 01:37:28.717
And it is there, only there...

01:37:28.885 --> 01:37:31.637
that you shall find the master.

01:37:31.804 --> 01:37:33.931
You sure look like a master to me.

01:37:39.270 --> 01:37:42.940
All right, Leroy,
who's the one and only master?

01:37:43.107 --> 01:37:44.149
I am.

01:37:47.237 --> 01:37:49.530
- No!
- I am.

01:37:50.365 --> 01:37:52.074
What the...?

01:37:52.867 --> 01:37:53.992
Oh, shit!

01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:57.704
Goddamn!

01:37:57.872 --> 01:37:59.665
Let me go! Let me go!

01:38:11.594 --> 01:38:13.554
Holy shit.

01:38:22.605 --> 01:38:24.356
Okay, come on.

01:39:25.793 --> 01:39:27.377
I applaud you, Leroy.

01:39:27.545 --> 01:39:29.212
That's a great finish.

01:39:29.380 --> 01:39:32.257
Not the ending I had in mind,
but it's a great finish.

01:39:32.425 --> 01:39:35.636
You see, a .45 will put an end
to all this kung fu crap.

01:39:36.512 --> 01:39:39.181
All it takes is one little bullet.

01:39:39.349 --> 01:39:41.558
So take your final bows, scum sucker.

01:39:47.690 --> 01:39:50.108
- Leroy!
- Oh, my God, no!

01:40:22.684 --> 01:40:25.977
Get on him, Leroy! Go, Leroy!

01:40:26.145 --> 01:40:28.689
Drown him, Leroy! Drown him!

01:40:28.856 --> 01:40:30.565
Drown that sucker!

01:40:30.733 --> 01:40:32.734
What?! No! Oh, God, no!

01:40:32.902 --> 01:40:35.612
- All right!
- No, wait! No! Jesus! No, listen!

01:40:35.780 --> 01:40:39.032
I've never seen anything like that.
I mean anything. No, wait!

01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:40.701
Listen, we can make a deal!

01:40:40.868 --> 01:40:43.245
We could make money!
You get foreign rights...

01:40:43.413 --> 01:40:45.747
I'll take domestic.
What do you say? Wait.

01:40:45.915 --> 01:40:48.250
You can have both, foreign and domestic!

01:40:48.418 --> 01:40:49.960
Just give me a finder's fee!

01:40:50.128 --> 01:40:52.087
Okay, all right, no finder's fee.

01:40:52.255 --> 01:40:53.755
You can have the whole thing!

01:40:53.923 --> 01:40:56.675
Let me pass.
We've got a television show to do.

01:40:57.635 --> 01:41:00.178
- Excuse me.
- Laura, where have you been?

01:41:00.346 --> 01:41:02.889
We've been looking all over for you.
You're late.

01:41:03.057 --> 01:41:04.808
How can I have her ready on time?

01:41:04.976 --> 01:41:06.810
Look at you. You're a mess.

01:41:06.978 --> 01:41:09.563
I don't have the right tools with me.

01:41:09.731 --> 01:41:11.648
Richie. Where'd he go?

01:41:11.816 --> 01:41:13.775
Where have you guys been?!

01:41:13.943 --> 01:41:15.902
Listen, I'd like to report a mugging.

01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:19.322
My friend and I, Mr. Nuff,
we were minding our own business.

01:41:19.490 --> 01:41:21.783
We were assaulted by these hoodlums!

01:41:21.951 --> 01:41:23.702
We're lucky to be alive!

01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:26.955
Save it, Arkadian!
You're going up for good this time!

01:41:27.874 --> 01:41:30.125
- Never!
- Come on, you're due in the studio.

01:41:30.293 --> 01:41:31.376
Let's go.

01:42:23.971 --> 01:42:25.263
Ready for commercial.

01:42:30.520 --> 01:42:33.355
Would you teach me some moves?!

01:42:39.987 --> 01:42:42.155
Yo, man, check out the cornball!

01:42:42.323 --> 01:42:43.865
He ain't no cornball!

01:42:44.033 --> 01:42:47.828
He's my brother and he's the master.
