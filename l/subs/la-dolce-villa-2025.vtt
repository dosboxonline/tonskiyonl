00:56.291 --> 00:57.125
What?

04:57.375 --> 04:59.291
Honey, I had to come open up the cafe.

04:59.833 --> 05:02.166
I understand but sometimes
I think you love this cafe more than me.

05:02.250 --> 05:03.708
I love you both equally.

05:04.291 --> 05:05.166
Equally, Cesare!?

05:05.250 --> 05:06.250
-Are you serious?
-No, actually…

05:06.333 --> 05:07.166
Really?

05:07.250 --> 05:08.083
Not equally…

05:08.166 --> 05:09.250
I can't take this!

05:17.208 --> 05:18.083
Hi, Cesare.

05:18.625 --> 05:19.750
Two coffees, please.

05:19.833 --> 05:21.250
Nico, two coffees for Olivia.

05:25.750 --> 05:28.750
Maybe today this beauty
will finally join me for a coffee.

05:29.125 --> 05:30.916
Charm doesn't work on me, Giovanni.

05:32.125 --> 05:34.208
I've never struck out so bad before.

05:35.000 --> 05:36.708
It's good to have new experiences.

09:08.708 --> 09:09.958
Matteo, can you hear me?

09:10.375 --> 09:12.458
Yes, Francesca, yes, hello…

09:13.916 --> 09:17.625
I'm here with a man
from the road maintenance company.

09:17.708 --> 09:20.375
Montezara's check bounced again.

09:20.458 --> 09:22.125
Just grab the emergency credit card,

09:22.208 --> 09:24.083
in the bottom drawer of the desk.

09:27.375 --> 09:28.541
It's stuck.

09:28.625 --> 09:29.708
Give it a kick!

09:31.875 --> 09:33.041
Nope, not even now…

09:33.375 --> 09:34.541
Harder! Understand?

09:35.125 --> 09:36.000
Harder… yes.

09:39.208 --> 09:40.875
Here we go… yes!

09:40.958 --> 09:42.291
Thank you, Francesca.

09:42.375 --> 09:43.708
Good. Good, good.

15:41.083 --> 15:41.916
Good evening.

15:42.500 --> 15:45.375
Bernardo, may I have a moment
about my expansion permit?

15:45.708 --> 15:46.541
Excuse us.

16:37.750 --> 16:39.041
He's nice, right?

16:39.666 --> 16:40.875
He's American…

16:41.125 --> 16:43.041
So, Grumpy Mario's house?

16:43.125 --> 16:44.166
That's a gamble.

16:45.125 --> 16:47.250
Especially not on the official list.

16:47.833 --> 16:50.291
The young people are all moving away.

16:50.625 --> 16:51.791
To Rome, Milan.

16:52.916 --> 16:55.083
We have to do something to save our town.

16:55.166 --> 16:59.000
So the solution is for strangers
with frozen pizza to take over?

17:01.875 --> 17:03.500
Think of it as them joining us,

17:03.750 --> 17:04.833
not taking over.

17:06.333 --> 17:09.625
If I want to get the assessore
to back my new initiatives,

17:09.708 --> 17:12.958
I need this first one-euro house
to be a total success.

17:13.833 --> 17:14.750
All right.

20:06.083 --> 20:07.541
Promise me you'll do what you can

20:07.625 --> 20:08.666
to speed things up.

20:09.250 --> 20:11.375
You know what this means for Montezara.

20:13.125 --> 20:14.208
Work your magic.

20:14.708 --> 20:16.625
How can I say no to you, ladybug?

23:03.958 --> 23:04.875
What period are they from?

23:04.958 --> 23:06.166
The late 1800s.

23:06.250 --> 23:08.291
I always imagined my house
with Moroccan tiles.

26:35.875 --> 26:36.916
Ignore him.

26:37.000 --> 26:37.833
All right.

26:39.125 --> 26:40.375
Good morning, ladies.

26:40.666 --> 26:41.500
Good morning!

26:41.958 --> 26:42.916
Why are you speaking to him?

26:43.458 --> 26:44.583
I'm being polite.

26:44.791 --> 26:45.750
But he's a stranger!

26:46.583 --> 26:48.708
A handsome stranger.

26:49.416 --> 26:53.166
So now you're the town flirt?

26:53.916 --> 26:56.500
Don't fall for those eyes.

26:56.916 --> 26:58.750
These Americans are here to ruin us!

27:09.041 --> 27:10.208
Typical American.

27:11.708 --> 27:14.291
Arrogant. Thinks everyone speaks English.

27:14.375 --> 27:17.041
Fine by me, I like them cocky.

27:17.125 --> 27:18.583
And so fit.

29:03.291 --> 29:04.333
Here we are.

29:18.833 --> 29:20.250
Oh dear, no…

29:22.541 --> 29:23.875
It can't be.

29:50.083 --> 29:51.750
Madam Mayor?

29:51.833 --> 29:53.333
Your guests are here.

29:53.416 --> 29:57.708
I was just finishing up a tour
with our American guest.

29:58.541 --> 30:00.000
Please, right this way.

31:46.416 --> 31:48.125
Totally out of the blue.

43:51.250 --> 43:52.500
Giuliano Montaldo…

43:53.500 --> 43:55.375
…now, that was a beautiful man.

43:56.208 --> 43:57.625
Good morning, ladies.

43:58.708 --> 44:00.000
Beautiful day today.

44:10.000 --> 44:11.208
I still don't understand.

44:11.625 --> 44:13.958
Plugs up and down our historical roads?

44:14.041 --> 44:15.125
We've gone over this.

44:15.541 --> 44:17.541
The tourists are the ones
asking for charging stations.

44:18.000 --> 44:20.750
Rental car fleets are all going electric.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.208
Ah, our American resident.

44:31.833 --> 44:33.250
My apologies…

44:35.916 --> 44:38.625
Matteo can answer
any remaining questions, gentlemen.

48:11.291 --> 48:12.333
Hello, ladies.

48:14.000 --> 48:15.291
I'm Eric Field.

48:16.166 --> 48:17.416
He's speaking Italian.

48:17.500 --> 48:18.541
Badly.

48:18.625 --> 48:21.208
Rome wasn't built in a day.

48:21.958 --> 48:23.250
I'm come for advisory.

48:23.333 --> 48:25.125
You know here around everything.

48:25.208 --> 48:26.666
That we do.

48:29.000 --> 48:31.166
But we do, and he's making an effort.

48:31.750 --> 48:33.208
What do you need, young man?

48:34.458 --> 48:35.875
I'm going on a picnic.

48:36.333 --> 48:37.916
With Francesca.

48:39.750 --> 48:41.833
Called that on day one.

48:42.708 --> 48:44.708
Pay up, sister. I won the bet.

48:44.791 --> 48:45.666
C'mon, pay up.

48:46.333 --> 48:47.291
Grifter.

48:49.583 --> 48:52.625
What are some of the mayor's favorites?

48:53.333 --> 48:56.458
She's a fan of Prosciutto di Cinta.

48:56.541 --> 48:58.000
Also a little Gota.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Get some local Caprino del Maremma cheese.

49:01.083 --> 49:03.125
Only insiders know about that.

49:03.208 --> 49:04.625
She'll be impressed.

49:05.708 --> 49:07.541
Like he'll remember any of this.

49:07.625 --> 49:09.583
Men have terrible memories.

49:09.666 --> 49:11.708
Because of their much smaller brains.

49:12.041 --> 49:13.750
We'll write you out a list.

49:16.416 --> 49:18.500
You'll also need this.

54:11.875 --> 54:12.708
Yes…

54:13.458 --> 54:14.291
No, no, no,

54:14.375 --> 54:15.666
I'll come right now, yes.

54:16.166 --> 54:17.000
Bye.

56:19.708 --> 56:20.541
Look at this…

56:21.041 --> 56:23.375
This graph shows how
my sustainability projects

56:23.458 --> 56:24.750
can eventually pay for themselves.

56:25.416 --> 56:27.125
Francesca, you got this.

56:28.166 --> 56:29.125
Grappa time?

56:30.666 --> 56:33.375
Not every event calls for grappa.

56:38.541 --> 56:40.041
I stopped by earlier, but you were out.

56:40.125 --> 56:41.166
Unusual for you.

56:41.750 --> 56:43.125
I was on a professional visit.

56:44.208 --> 56:48.458
What's going on with the change-of-use
permit for the Field Villa?

56:49.125 --> 56:50.583
Eric says he hasn't seen you.

56:51.083 --> 56:51.958
Was he…

56:52.041 --> 56:54.041
…your…professional visit?

56:55.000 --> 56:57.083
Olivia can't apply
for the commercial license

56:57.166 --> 56:58.958
until the permit is squared away.

56:59.541 --> 57:03.250
But Mario's house wasn't even
officially cleared for the one-euro list.

57:03.333 --> 57:05.375
And now this ridiculous idea
for a cooking school.

57:05.458 --> 57:07.375
Why would anyone come here to cook?

57:07.458 --> 57:10.125
Montezara can be
so much more than you imagine.

57:10.708 --> 57:11.875
I wish you could see that.

57:12.458 --> 57:14.500
Then convince me, ladybug.

57:15.500 --> 57:16.333
Dinner?

57:17.041 --> 57:19.541
I can't. I have to work all night.

57:20.250 --> 57:21.083
Can we…

57:21.750 --> 57:23.041
…have gelato this week?

57:24.500 --> 57:25.333
Anytime.

57:27.750 --> 57:28.625
I never said that…

57:28.708 --> 57:29.833
-Are you calling me crazy?
-Listen to me.

57:29.916 --> 57:32.083
-Just say you think I'm crazy.
-No, no, but…

01:00:06.708 --> 01:00:07.833
Here we are.

01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:11.291
Bye, Francesca, thanks so much.

01:01:11.375 --> 01:01:12.375
Until next time.

01:01:23.333 --> 01:01:24.208
Good job.

01:01:24.291 --> 01:01:25.583
Everything was exquisite.

01:02:11.791 --> 01:02:13.458
Your favorite grandson is here!

01:02:13.541 --> 01:02:14.458
Here he is!

01:02:16.916 --> 01:02:18.291
Granny's handsome boy!

01:02:27.166 --> 01:02:28.000
Only one drink,

01:02:28.083 --> 01:02:29.833
then I must return to prep dinner service.

01:02:31.875 --> 01:02:33.458
Do you have to rush off?

01:02:34.041 --> 01:02:35.375
I have the whole day.

01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:36.791
How beautiful.

01:02:40.125 --> 01:02:41.583
And Antonia here

01:02:41.666 --> 01:02:43.041
was a professional baker.

01:02:43.625 --> 01:02:44.875
And us two Antonias

01:02:44.958 --> 01:02:46.583
worked in her shop.

01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:49.083
I was THE baker.

01:02:49.166 --> 01:02:51.500
I was the first woman in Montezara

01:02:51.583 --> 01:02:53.333
with her own business.

01:02:53.416 --> 01:02:54.916
Wow, what happened to it?

01:02:55.458 --> 01:02:56.791
We got old.

01:02:56.875 --> 01:02:58.625
We were put out to pasture.

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:00.583
I thought you liked

01:03:00.666 --> 01:03:01.625
"the sweetness of doing nothing."

01:03:01.875 --> 01:03:03.416
I'm bored out of my mind.

01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:04.750
We want to be

01:03:04.833 --> 01:03:06.250
"Grandfluencers."

01:03:06.333 --> 01:03:07.416
On the TikTok.

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:08.958
Hashtag: Goals.

01:03:09.333 --> 01:03:10.166
Right?

01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.458
Right!

01:04:18.166 --> 01:04:19.083
I would like

01:04:19.166 --> 01:04:20.000
to go

01:04:20.083 --> 01:04:20.916
to Rome.

01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:23.333
I would like

01:04:23.416 --> 01:04:24.250
to go

01:04:24.333 --> 01:04:25.250
to Rome.

01:05:27.250 --> 01:05:28.083
Congratulations!

01:09:27.625 --> 01:09:28.666
I have never…

01:09:28.750 --> 01:09:30.041
eaten anything…

01:09:30.125 --> 01:09:31.500
…this good before.

01:09:31.583 --> 01:09:32.500
Of course not.

01:09:32.583 --> 01:09:35.000
American pastries are an abomination.

01:09:35.666 --> 01:09:38.083
I hear Dunkin' Donuts are good.

01:09:38.166 --> 01:09:39.333
Leave the fountain.

01:09:40.208 --> 01:09:41.333
These are called

01:09:41.416 --> 01:09:42.625
Panforte.

01:09:45.083 --> 01:09:46.125
While I was looking

01:09:46.208 --> 01:09:47.666
for the villa blueprint,

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:49.875
look what I found.

01:09:53.625 --> 01:09:54.541
Look!

01:09:54.625 --> 01:09:55.958
How pretty.

01:09:56.041 --> 01:09:57.791
We were so young.

01:09:58.625 --> 01:10:00.583
It's time to unretire.

01:10:01.083 --> 01:10:03.750
Teach at our cooking school.

01:10:03.833 --> 01:10:04.958
Become…

01:10:05.041 --> 01:10:06.583
…"Grandfluencers"!

01:15:45.125 --> 01:15:48.250
All right, see you Wednesday at 2:00. Bye.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:51.375
You're dating Eric Field.

01:15:52.166 --> 01:15:53.041
Yes, it's new.

01:15:53.916 --> 01:15:54.750
But,

01:15:55.291 --> 01:15:57.375
I haven't had the chance to tell anyone.

01:15:59.041 --> 01:16:00.083
What about you and me?

01:16:00.166 --> 01:16:01.583
You know how I feel.

01:16:02.583 --> 01:16:05.041
I thought it was because
you were still mourning Alessandro.

01:16:05.708 --> 01:16:08.250
I didn't think I wanted a relationship.

01:16:08.916 --> 01:16:11.291
But we have history. And he's leaving…

01:16:11.375 --> 01:16:13.041
The truth is that
Eric's actually thinking about staying.

01:16:13.458 --> 01:16:15.208
To run the cooking school.

01:16:15.583 --> 01:16:16.750
The cooking school? But--

01:16:16.833 --> 01:16:18.166
You had doubts, I know.

01:16:19.208 --> 01:16:20.958
I may have asked too much of you.

01:16:21.875 --> 01:16:24.208
Anyway… in the end I did it myself…

01:16:24.291 --> 01:16:26.250
…and got the change-of-use permit.

01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:28.708
Listen…

01:16:29.625 --> 01:16:32.416
…on Saturday,
they are doing the fresco reveal.

01:16:32.916 --> 01:16:36.166
You helped this first
one-euro house be a success.

01:16:36.416 --> 01:16:37.750
I would like you to come.

01:17:12.750 --> 01:17:13.583
You're a genius.

01:17:14.666 --> 01:17:15.541
You're a genius, Eric.

01:17:23.583 --> 01:17:25.250
Put that here, please.

01:17:26.833 --> 01:17:28.041
Those four over there.

01:17:28.666 --> 01:17:29.500
Thank you!

01:18:48.583 --> 01:18:49.583
What have you done?

01:18:49.666 --> 01:18:50.833
I warned you, Francesca.

01:18:50.916 --> 01:18:53.291
You shouldn't have "sold" this property
before the claim window closed.

01:19:31.208 --> 01:19:33.708
Mario's great-grandmother was Maria Leoni,

01:19:33.791 --> 01:19:35.666
born in 1867.

01:19:36.250 --> 01:19:38.541
That would make Larry Longo
the closest living relative.

01:19:38.833 --> 01:19:40.250
So the relatives in Italy

01:19:40.333 --> 01:19:42.666
weren't actually allowed
to donate the land.

01:19:43.666 --> 01:19:44.958
This isn't looking good.

01:19:45.041 --> 01:19:45.958
Not good at all.

01:19:51.333 --> 01:19:52.166
Not now.

01:19:52.541 --> 01:19:53.708
Not now, Matteo. Please.

01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:18.666
How could I?

01:24:20.541 --> 01:24:22.833
How could I make such a mess of this?

01:24:25.375 --> 01:24:27.208
Pass her your "medicine."

01:24:27.791 --> 01:24:29.041
What "medicine"?

01:24:29.875 --> 01:24:31.583
You're not fooling anyone!

01:24:37.500 --> 01:24:39.875
I blame Grumpy Mario.

01:24:39.958 --> 01:24:42.541
The Leoni family was always so rude.

01:24:42.625 --> 01:24:43.541
No, Antonia,

01:24:43.625 --> 01:24:45.750
that was the Leone family.

01:24:45.833 --> 01:24:47.833
You're confused, Antonia.

01:24:47.916 --> 01:24:50.875
The Leone family was simply lovely.

01:24:51.833 --> 01:24:52.916
What did you say?

01:24:53.333 --> 01:24:55.125
There was a Leoni family, with an "i"?

01:24:55.208 --> 01:24:56.166
Yes.

01:24:56.250 --> 01:24:57.833
And a Leone family with an "e"?

01:24:57.916 --> 01:24:58.791
Yes!

01:25:01.791 --> 01:25:04.708
The mayor just stole my "medicine"!

01:25:06.333 --> 01:25:08.416
Did you know there used to be
a Leone family in town?

01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:09.375
With an "e"?

01:25:09.791 --> 01:25:11.208
Wait, are you thinking…?

01:25:11.291 --> 01:25:13.958
Maybe Larry Longo's
great-great-grandmother's surname

01:25:14.041 --> 01:25:16.000
was changed when she emigrated to America.

01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:18.166
I hear that was a common mistake.

01:25:18.250 --> 01:25:19.708
There's only one way to find out.

01:25:30.750 --> 01:25:31.666
Madam Mayor?

01:25:32.375 --> 01:25:33.208
Matteo, not now.

01:25:33.625 --> 01:25:35.500
I'm searching for the census binders.

01:25:35.875 --> 01:25:37.958
The 1860s are all missing…

01:25:38.416 --> 01:25:39.583
I brought coffee.

01:25:39.666 --> 01:25:41.000
And reinforcements.

01:25:41.541 --> 01:25:42.458
Here we are.

01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.750
Anything to help the Fields.

01:25:44.833 --> 01:25:46.083
And anything to help you.

01:25:47.125 --> 01:25:48.166
Thank you, guys.

01:25:49.083 --> 01:25:50.083
Let's get to work.

01:25:50.208 --> 01:25:51.375
Let's go.

01:26:55.541 --> 01:26:56.375
Hey, guys.

01:26:56.625 --> 01:26:58.625
I found these
under the sink in the bathroom.

01:26:59.750 --> 01:27:00.833
Ew, gross! No.

01:27:00.916 --> 01:27:01.916
Mildew. No.

01:27:05.458 --> 01:27:06.750
These are the ones!

01:27:07.041 --> 01:27:07.875
Genius.

01:27:08.916 --> 01:27:10.333
Each of you, take one, quickly!

01:27:10.416 --> 01:27:11.375
Good job, my love!

01:27:24.833 --> 01:27:26.833
1867…

01:27:29.583 --> 01:27:31.125
1867!

01:27:31.208 --> 01:27:32.708
Guys! Come over here!

01:27:33.791 --> 01:27:35.541
Maria Leon-"i",

01:27:35.625 --> 01:27:38.833
was born on March 17th, 1867.

01:27:38.916 --> 01:27:40.750
Grumpy Mario's grandmother.

01:27:41.250 --> 01:27:42.750
Maria Leon-"e",

01:27:42.833 --> 01:27:44.833
was born on July 6th that same exact year.

01:27:45.333 --> 01:27:46.791
Her family left for America

01:27:46.875 --> 01:27:48.750
when she was seven years old.

01:27:48.833 --> 01:27:50.583
That's Larry Longo's relative!

01:27:51.708 --> 01:27:52.541
Grappa!

01:27:53.250 --> 01:27:54.083
What time is it?

01:27:54.541 --> 01:27:55.375
10:05.

01:27:56.291 --> 01:27:58.000
Eric's leaving on the 10:10.

01:27:58.500 --> 01:27:59.333
There's no reception.

01:27:59.416 --> 01:28:00.708
I'll never make it in time.

01:28:00.791 --> 01:28:01.625
Yes, you will.

01:28:02.166 --> 01:28:03.083
You have a secret weapon.

01:28:03.875 --> 01:28:04.708
Let's go!

01:28:10.541 --> 01:28:12.625
Go get your man!

01:28:12.708 --> 01:28:14.458
Go! Go!

01:28:54.791 --> 01:28:55.750
I love you.

01:28:59.416 --> 01:29:00.625
I love you too.

01:30:36.583 --> 01:30:38.875
Montezara has the new cooking school.

01:30:38.958 --> 01:30:41.541
And we are expanding
the one-euro house program.

01:30:41.625 --> 01:30:42.833
And Testa Travel,

01:30:42.916 --> 01:30:44.500
an all-electrical vehicle company,

01:30:44.583 --> 01:30:46.291
is adding our town as a stop on its route.

01:30:47.208 --> 01:30:49.500
I project a budget surplus by next year.

01:30:55.083 --> 01:30:56.041
It seems…

01:30:56.666 --> 01:30:58.791
…you'll need
those EV charging stations after all.

01:31:06.750 --> 01:31:08.333
Grappa time!

01:31:09.083 --> 01:31:10.041
Finally!

01:31:49.333 --> 01:31:50.875
Look how beautiful she is.

01:32:16.166 --> 01:32:17.666
Like my dad used to say…
