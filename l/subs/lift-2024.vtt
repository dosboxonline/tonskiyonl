14:11.916 --> 14:12.875
Sculptures.

14:13.583 --> 14:15.208
<i>Photography over here.</i>

14:15.208 --> 14:16.666
<i>Street art, maybe.</i>

14:16.666 --> 14:18.916
But we've never lifted an NFT.

14:18.916 --> 14:20.833
So you're thieves?

14:20.833 --> 14:23.625
We rescue works of art
from undeserving owners.

14:23.625 --> 14:26.333
And while I took Interpol on a tour...

14:26.333 --> 14:29.291
The rest of our team was in London,
rescuing a Van Gogh.

14:29.291 --> 14:31.500
But you bought my NFT, right?
I mean, I saw--

14:31.500 --> 14:33.208
A legit transaction.

14:33.875 --> 14:37.666
We presold the Van Gogh
on the black market for $20 million.

14:37.666 --> 14:39.375
Enough to cover your NFT.

14:39.875 --> 14:42.250
Then why did you fake my kidnapping?

14:42.250 --> 14:43.208
Borrowing.

14:44.166 --> 14:45.000
A human.

14:46.625 --> 14:50.000
Leonardo da Vinci sold
<i>The Mona Lisa</i> for $25,000,

14:50.000 --> 14:53.375
and nobody gave a shit about it
for 400 years until someone stole it.

14:53.375 --> 14:58.458
That smile is now worth $860 million
because there's a crazy story behind it.

14:58.458 --> 15:00.208
Just like the one of us borrowing you.

15:01.625 --> 15:04.583
And thanks to Interpol
and all the free publicity, well,

15:04.583 --> 15:07.458
the whole world now thinks
that you've been kidnapped,

15:08.416 --> 15:10.583
which only drove the price
of the NFT through the roof.

15:10.583 --> 15:13.625
- How much did we sell it for?
- We just closed, uh...

15:15.708 --> 15:17.458
Eighty-nine million.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.375
What?!

15:18.375 --> 15:19.500
Eighty-nine million.

15:19.500 --> 15:20.750
What?

15:20.750 --> 15:22.666
Eighty-nine million dollars.

15:23.541 --> 15:26.083
I... I beat Van Gogh?

15:26.083 --> 15:28.166
If my calculations are correct,

15:28.166 --> 15:31.083
we made $42 million
and you made 27 million.

15:31.083 --> 15:33.000
[exhales shakily]

15:33.000 --> 15:33.958
Boom!

15:33.958 --> 15:34.916
[sighs]

15:34.916 --> 15:36.208
Let's make a toast.

15:36.875 --> 15:39.916
- All right.
- To the world's first heist of an NFT!

15:39.916 --> 15:42.000
- Hey!
- [group] Cheers!

15:42.000 --> 15:44.166
- [group cheers]
<i>- Cheers! Hey! Whoo!</i>

15:44.166 --> 15:45.958
<i>Whoo, whoo, whoo!</i>

15:45.958 --> 15:49.125
Round of drinks on Luke, guys!
Everyone! Round of drinks!

15:49.125 --> 15:50.291
- No!
- [Magnus] Yes!

15:50.875 --> 15:52.250
[exhales]

15:52.916 --> 15:53.916
Where's Denton?

15:54.416 --> 15:59.333
[Abby] Forgery, fraud, fraud,
money laundering, impersonation, fraud.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.541
Hmm. Grand theft auto?

16:01.541 --> 16:02.583
Yes.

16:03.583 --> 16:05.916
It was a 1967 Ferrari Spider.

16:05.916 --> 16:07.833
- What color?
- Silver.

16:07.833 --> 16:10.500
Walnut dash, cream leather interior.

16:10.500 --> 16:12.916
And you crashed it into a canal?

16:12.916 --> 16:14.625
Okay, I did.

16:15.208 --> 16:17.375
You know, easy come, easy go.

16:20.416 --> 16:23.916
So... you two go back to Chicago, huh?

16:28.541 --> 16:31.083
I've never met this man before in my life.

16:34.750 --> 16:37.041
Oliver might know who he is, though.

16:37.041 --> 16:38.333
Who's Oliver?

16:38.333 --> 16:39.958
Oliver! Oliver!

16:41.041 --> 16:43.083
Oliver? [echoing]

16:45.000 --> 16:46.125
Oliver!

16:46.125 --> 16:48.000
[whimsical music playing]

16:49.375 --> 16:50.708
[chuckles]

16:50.708 --> 16:53.333
Oliver would have never crashed
the Ferrari.

16:53.333 --> 16:54.750
He's too responsible.

16:55.333 --> 16:57.500
Can I talk to Oliver?

16:57.500 --> 16:58.500
No.

16:59.666 --> 17:01.875
Okay, then. Let's talk about RICO.

17:02.458 --> 17:04.166
Thanks to your mess-up with the cane,

17:04.166 --> 17:08.166
we've got you placing a bid you didn't
have the funds to cover, which is fraud.

17:08.166 --> 17:11.875
And because it was over $10 million,
you're eligible for extradition to the US,

17:11.875 --> 17:14.458
where you're facing 20 years to life.

17:15.291 --> 17:16.541
Twenty years <i>is</i> life.

17:16.541 --> 17:18.625
And your friends
are looking at kidnapping,

17:18.625 --> 17:22.166
wire fraud, identity fraud,
and transportation of stolen property.

17:23.583 --> 17:25.000
Did I leave anything out?

17:25.666 --> 17:27.208
A little joy, maybe.

17:28.541 --> 17:30.666
[Ross] Boss. Got something.

17:33.375 --> 17:34.750
This just came for you.

17:42.250 --> 17:43.333
[scoffs]

17:43.333 --> 17:45.916
[intriguing, rhythmic music playing]

17:50.291 --> 17:51.583
We're going back to London.

17:52.875 --> 17:54.458
And we're taking him with us.

17:54.458 --> 17:55.875
Yay.

18:12.041 --> 18:13.833
Is Denton still in holding?

18:13.833 --> 18:16.750
- You mean Oliver?
- [scoffs] For real?

18:16.750 --> 18:19.125
This Oliver, he is a real pain in the ass.

18:19.125 --> 18:22.375
Gladwell. Come with me, please.

18:22.375 --> 18:25.833
- I'm in the middle of something.
- Right. Wasn't a request.

18:35.458 --> 18:36.583
[Abby] Everything okay?

18:36.583 --> 18:38.375
[Huxley] If it were, we'd be out of a job.

18:38.375 --> 18:42.375
Listen, I, uh...
I need to borrow your friend Cyrus.

18:42.375 --> 18:45.208
He's not my friend.
And what do you mean, "borrow"?

18:45.208 --> 18:48.125
Well, in the same way
that he would borrow a Picasso.

18:49.166 --> 18:51.125
- I'm gonna offer him a deal.
- [Abby] What?

18:51.125 --> 18:52.625
- No.
- [Huxley] Yeah.

18:52.625 --> 18:55.083
No, no! You do not get to do this.

18:55.083 --> 18:57.208
You think the art division
is a third-rate department.

18:57.208 --> 18:58.125
It is.

18:58.125 --> 19:01.333
But you do not get to wipe out
a year of my work.

19:01.333 --> 19:04.416
That's literally what I'm doing,
so take a seat and let it sink in.

19:06.875 --> 19:09.333
[tense music playing]

19:13.250 --> 19:15.000
What do you know about Lars Jorgensen?

19:15.000 --> 19:18.708
- He owns a hell of a lot of stolen art.
- He's done a lot worse than that.

19:19.333 --> 19:21.333
He started as a banker who was legit,

19:21.333 --> 19:23.541
then began putting
his money in terror groups,

19:23.541 --> 19:27.458
bankrolling attacks, then shorting
irrelevant stocks and making a fortune.

19:27.458 --> 19:31.416
He doesn't care how many people die,
just how much ends up in his bank account.

19:31.416 --> 19:34.250
Remember the New Zealand plane
that went down? 183 dead.

19:34.250 --> 19:37.166
Airline stock plummeted
just like those poor souls.

19:37.166 --> 19:39.875
And guess who made a fortune
off shorting that stock?

19:39.875 --> 19:41.375
So why haven't you arrested him?

19:41.375 --> 19:44.708
It's what I've been trying to do
for years, but nothing can stick.

19:44.708 --> 19:46.166
Everyone's scared of him.

19:46.166 --> 19:48.208
Except that now,
I have someone on the inside.

19:48.208 --> 19:49.291
This guy.

19:50.208 --> 19:51.458
Arthur Tigue.

19:51.458 --> 19:54.083
Now, Jorgensen's been paying Tigue
to work on something new.

19:54.083 --> 19:56.458
I caught him,
I turned him, and I got him to talk.

19:56.458 --> 19:58.541
According to this weasel,

19:58.541 --> 20:01.750
Jorgensen's been chatting
with the hacker group Leviathan.

20:01.750 --> 20:02.750
Leviathan?

20:02.750 --> 20:05.333
[Huxley] They're planning some kind
of massive strike on water.

20:05.333 --> 20:08.166
Utilities, dams, it's all on the grid now.

20:08.166 --> 20:10.041
They could flood a city.

20:10.583 --> 20:12.833
Dry up a whole country if they wanted.

20:12.833 --> 20:14.291
Millions could die.

20:14.291 --> 20:16.833
And Jorgensen would make billions off it.

20:17.500 --> 20:19.333
He's been shorting stocks and utilities.

20:19.333 --> 20:21.375
We don't know when
or where he's gonna strike.

20:21.375 --> 20:25.166
But what we do know is that
Leviathan want their payment in gold.

20:25.166 --> 20:28.083
Half a billion dollars in gold,
to be precise.

20:28.083 --> 20:29.375
And Jorgensen is gonna move it

20:29.375 --> 20:32.500
from his vault
in London to Zurich in 17 days.

20:32.500 --> 20:35.833
- You can't intercept it because it's...
- Totally legal...

20:35.833 --> 20:37.625
To move your own gold.

20:43.958 --> 20:44.791
No.

20:45.791 --> 20:48.541
No, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

20:48.541 --> 20:50.583
- [Huxley] You don't know what I'll ask.
- I do.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.666
- You don't.
- You want Cyrus to nick the gold.

20:52.666 --> 20:54.875
Well, I wouldn't have used
the word "nick," but--

20:54.875 --> 20:58.416
You want to rely on Cyrus Whitaker
for an operation of this scale?

20:58.416 --> 21:01.791
Trust him with
half a billion dollars worth of gold?

21:01.791 --> 21:03.375
Yeah, why not?

21:03.375 --> 21:06.000
He's a thief,
a con man, a professional liar.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.625
You cannot possibly trust him.

21:07.625 --> 21:09.833
I work in a building
with intelligence agents,

21:09.833 --> 21:12.500
and I don't trust any of them.
'Cause we're all liars. All of us.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.708
- What's another one?
- It is not the same thing.

21:14.708 --> 21:17.791
Our job is to do things we don't like
and make calls we don't want,

21:17.791 --> 21:20.375
so the rest of the world
can just carry on.

21:22.583 --> 21:23.791
What if he says no?

21:23.791 --> 21:26.208
It's your job to make sure
that doesn't happen.

21:34.250 --> 21:36.250
[bright, energetic music playing]

21:56.083 --> 21:57.083
[exhales]

21:59.375 --> 22:01.000
Took you long enough.

22:03.375 --> 22:04.583
[elevator bell dings]

22:04.583 --> 22:06.791
[pop music playing on stereo]

22:06.791 --> 22:08.541
Can I get you a drink?

22:08.541 --> 22:11.791
What is it? Tequila during the day,
vodka by night, right?

22:11.791 --> 22:14.333
- I'll get it.
- [chuckles]

22:14.333 --> 22:16.416
All the good stuff is in the back.

22:17.375 --> 22:21.000
Yeah. But we wouldn't want you to take
all year to find it. Let me help you.

22:23.375 --> 22:24.750
You look good.

22:26.291 --> 22:27.541
[Abby clears throat]

22:28.333 --> 22:29.208
[chuckles]

22:29.208 --> 22:33.125
You know, it is pretty funny
that the thing that got you busted

22:33.125 --> 22:34.125
was an NFT.

22:36.458 --> 22:38.333
A little tacky.

22:38.333 --> 22:42.291
Sometimes, you gotta roll with the times.
And stop, we didn't steal anything.

22:42.291 --> 22:45.000
That NFT was
a completely legitimate transaction.

22:45.750 --> 22:47.500
Right. Of course.

22:47.500 --> 22:51.000
- [takes a deep breath] Am I in trouble?
- For stealing a Van Gogh?

22:51.583 --> 22:52.875
We caught your buyer.

22:52.875 --> 22:55.416
He gave up Denton, Luke, and Magnus.

22:55.416 --> 22:59.541
That was real cute, by the way,
nicking the painting that was in the NFT.

22:59.541 --> 23:01.666
Thought you'd appreciate
the artistry involved.

23:01.666 --> 23:03.750
You stole art, Cyrus. You didn't make it.

23:03.750 --> 23:04.916
[Cyrus grunts softly]

23:04.916 --> 23:06.958
[takes a deep breath]

23:06.958 --> 23:08.750
Are you still pissed about Paris?

23:10.791 --> 23:13.000
- I'm not going to discuss that with you.
- No?

23:13.000 --> 23:15.375
- No.
- I was kind of hoping we could.

23:15.375 --> 23:19.375
- It was a mistake, okay? An accident.
- An accident? For a full week?

23:19.375 --> 23:21.541
It was five days, not a week!

23:21.541 --> 23:22.833
A business week.

23:22.833 --> 23:25.833
And if I'd have known
who you were, what you did,

23:25.833 --> 23:27.416
it would never have happened.

23:27.416 --> 23:28.500
So, what about you?

23:28.500 --> 23:31.500
I mean, I thought I was going to dinner
with the curator of the Gagosian.

23:31.500 --> 23:33.125
- I was undercover.
- So was I.

23:33.125 --> 23:34.916
- Not the same.
- Agree to disagree.

23:36.708 --> 23:38.875
We fell for the cover. That's it.

23:39.375 --> 23:40.583
That's all it was.

23:41.625 --> 23:43.083
Okay, so what is this?

23:43.750 --> 23:46.666
- Are you here to arrest me, Abby?
- Agent Gladwell.

23:46.666 --> 23:48.583
Agent? [scoffs]

23:48.583 --> 23:49.708
And no.

23:52.083 --> 23:54.875
I have been ordered to offer you a deal.

23:54.875 --> 23:58.000
[laughs]

23:58.000 --> 23:59.291
Wow.

23:59.791 --> 24:01.583
- That's gotta sting, huh?
- [sighs]

24:01.583 --> 24:03.166
Is that why you're so pissed?

24:03.833 --> 24:04.958
What kind of deal?

24:07.500 --> 24:09.000
We need you to steal something.

24:10.041 --> 24:12.708
I'm sorry. I couldn't hear you.
Do me a favor. Say it again.

24:12.708 --> 24:16.875
- But slower. Say it slower this time.
- Gold. A lot of gold.

24:16.875 --> 24:18.875
Half a billion dollars' worth.

24:21.625 --> 24:22.458
What's the catch?

24:23.041 --> 24:26.250
The owner of the gold
is a man named Lars Jorgensen.

24:26.250 --> 24:27.375
[Cyrus scoffs]

24:27.875 --> 24:28.833
You know him?

24:30.500 --> 24:32.375
By reputation, yeah.

24:33.625 --> 24:35.083
There's some people you steal from,

24:35.083 --> 24:37.125
and there's some people
that you don't steal from.

24:37.125 --> 24:39.041
Lars Jorgensen kills both.

24:39.958 --> 24:41.375
It's a hard pass for me.

24:44.416 --> 24:46.416
We have you on the Van Gogh, Cyrus.

24:47.250 --> 24:48.958
Denton will die in jail.

24:50.041 --> 24:54.416
If you do this,
it's full immunity for you and your crew.

24:54.416 --> 24:57.541
All felonies wiped clean,
past and present.

24:57.541 --> 25:00.583
Camila hasn't seen
her family in eight years.

25:00.583 --> 25:03.208
Mi-Sun has a grandmother
who doesn't have long to live.

25:03.208 --> 25:05.166
Luke gets to see his poodle again.

25:05.166 --> 25:08.625
Magnus gets to go
to the Cajun Stage at Jazz Fest.

25:08.625 --> 25:11.083
Denton gets to go home, and you...

25:11.791 --> 25:13.833
You get to do

25:13.833 --> 25:15.708
whatever it is you do

25:16.916 --> 25:19.416
without looking over
your shoulder all the time.

25:21.083 --> 25:23.375
- Where are you at in all this?
- What do you mean?

25:23.375 --> 25:25.041
What's your role in the operation?

25:25.041 --> 25:27.166
This is my role.
I make you the offer, that's it.

25:27.166 --> 25:30.416
No, no. If we're signing up for this,
then so are you.

25:30.416 --> 25:32.875
Look, I know how these things work.
If Interpol's involved,

25:32.875 --> 25:36.041
that means as soon as things hit the fan
that we're left hung out to dry.

25:36.041 --> 25:38.750
But if you're with us,
then they can't do that.

25:38.750 --> 25:39.666
With you?

25:39.666 --> 25:40.875
On the team.

25:41.875 --> 25:44.750
- Interpol would never allow it.
- So then ask them.

25:45.708 --> 25:46.708
No you, no deal.

25:46.708 --> 25:49.291
You got 24 hours to respond,
Agent Gladwell.

25:53.708 --> 25:54.833
[smacks lips, sighs]

25:58.416 --> 26:00.208
[music fades]

26:00.208 --> 26:01.333
[Camila] No.

26:01.333 --> 26:02.583
She's Interpol.

26:02.583 --> 26:06.375
- Are you crazy?
- Absolutely not. No disrespect, yeah?

26:06.375 --> 26:07.875
- But no.
- It's a setup.

26:07.875 --> 26:10.500
It's a half a billion in gold.

26:10.500 --> 26:13.541
- That we don't get to keep.
- Yeah, but we get to see it.

26:13.541 --> 26:14.958
What do you want me to say?

26:14.958 --> 26:18.375
If we don't do this, we go to jail.
She has us on the Van Gogh.

26:18.375 --> 26:22.000
Plus, and not that this should sway
anyone, but it's about saving lives.

26:22.000 --> 26:24.250
- Saving lives. Lovely.
- Don't lead with that.

26:24.250 --> 26:27.041
- [Magnus] Boo!
- Oh no, no. No, no.

26:27.041 --> 26:28.541
[tuts] Uh-uh.

26:28.541 --> 26:31.541
I don't appreciate
the emotional blackmail, Cyrus.

26:31.541 --> 26:35.958
[tuts] This is not emotional blackmail.
This is <i>blackmail</i> blackmail.

26:36.833 --> 26:39.750
I just want to say
that I am liking the vibes here.

26:39.750 --> 26:42.250
I think they're good.
I think it's fun. I'm on board.

26:42.250 --> 26:44.250
Yeah. Of course you are.
Because you're crazy.

26:44.250 --> 26:45.625
[Magnus] We gotta stay positive.

26:45.625 --> 26:49.583
- Come on, you don't have to throw a no--
- Take a moment. Don't escalate it.

26:49.583 --> 26:52.166
- Get out of here!
- [Magnus] You get outta here!

26:52.166 --> 26:53.333
Tiny!

26:53.333 --> 26:55.833
- Hey! It's Oliver!
- [group laughs]

26:55.833 --> 26:57.333
Oliver!

26:58.125 --> 26:59.541
I love Oliver!

27:00.125 --> 27:05.208
Agent Gladwell,
I just wanted to introduce you to Oliver.

27:06.541 --> 27:08.875
Wow, I have heard a lot about you.

27:09.583 --> 27:11.500
- [Magnus] Oliver's my favorite.
- [Mi-Sun] Steve?

27:11.500 --> 27:12.416
[Magnus] Scary.

27:12.416 --> 27:15.541
All right, Agent Gladwell has the floor.
Let's give our attention.

27:15.541 --> 27:18.750
- [sighs] Why should we?
- Because she caught us.

27:21.375 --> 27:23.791
She knows what she's doing. Go ahead.

27:24.791 --> 27:25.750
Thank you.

27:27.375 --> 27:28.458
Okay.

27:28.958 --> 27:30.708
[screen whirs]

27:30.708 --> 27:34.291
So, 17 days from now,
Lars Jorgensen is moving

27:34.291 --> 27:38.208
half a billion dollars in gold bars
from his bank in London to Zurich.

27:38.208 --> 27:39.125
Nice.

27:39.708 --> 27:42.625
[Abby] The bars will be packed
in a single four-foot square crate,

27:42.625 --> 27:44.916
total weight, ten tons,

27:44.916 --> 27:49.416
then delivered by truck from the bank
to Heathrow under heavy guard

27:49.416 --> 27:52.958
and loaded onto
a Sky Suisse passenger plane to Zurich.

27:52.958 --> 27:55.958
So, somewhere between the Bank of London

27:55.958 --> 27:59.958
and the runway in Zurich,
the gold needs to disappear.

28:01.791 --> 28:03.458
Gold needs to disappear. Great.

28:04.041 --> 28:05.083
That gave me chills.

28:06.791 --> 28:10.000
Well, it's an exciting story. It's...

28:10.000 --> 28:12.250
- It's impossible.
- It's not impossible.

28:12.250 --> 28:13.458
Oh, this is.

28:13.458 --> 28:16.208
Stay positive. We can do this.
Try it with me.

28:16.208 --> 28:18.291
[in Spanish]
What I can do is beat your ass.

28:18.291 --> 28:19.291
Want your ass beat?

28:19.916 --> 28:21.583
I can understand what you're saying.

28:21.583 --> 28:24.208
[in English] Come on. Stop.
Camila, I'm with you.

28:24.208 --> 28:25.708
I don't know if it's possible.

28:26.291 --> 28:30.541
I don't like it any more than any of you,
but we know the rules to our game.

28:30.541 --> 28:33.541
- When you're beat, what do you do?
- Accept defeat gracefully?

28:33.541 --> 28:35.625
AKA you go to jail or...

28:35.625 --> 28:37.208
[group] Look for the nearest exit.

28:37.208 --> 28:40.958
That's right! This is it. So we do it,
we do it well, and we get out.

28:40.958 --> 28:42.833
Let's treat it like any other lift.

28:42.833 --> 28:45.000
Examine it from top to bottom,
find a weakness.

28:45.000 --> 28:47.041
If there's a way to do it, we find it.

28:47.708 --> 28:49.375
None of us want to go to jail.

28:49.375 --> 28:52.291
And we damn sure
don't want to piss off Lars Jorgensen.

28:52.791 --> 28:53.958
[dog growls]

28:54.833 --> 28:56.833
[birds calling in distance]

28:58.541 --> 29:00.083
[tense music playing]

29:00.083 --> 29:01.333
Morning, Arthur.

29:01.916 --> 29:03.416
[Arthur groans]

29:03.416 --> 29:06.791
So you didn't make it home
from the pub last night, then, eh?

29:06.791 --> 29:08.625
[barks]

29:09.375 --> 29:10.541
[Cormac grunts]

29:10.541 --> 29:11.708
[exhales]

29:15.166 --> 29:17.375
- [Arthur grunts] Okay! Okay!
- [line ringing]

29:17.375 --> 29:19.208
[dog growls]

29:19.208 --> 29:20.125
[Arthur] Stop!

29:21.416 --> 29:22.500
[Cormac] Hey, Jorgensen,

29:22.500 --> 29:24.208
<i>you remember Arthur Tigue.</i>

29:25.000 --> 29:26.375
He used to work for us.

29:26.958 --> 29:28.625
Yes. Mr. Tigue.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.708
I'm sorry I couldn't be there in person.

29:31.708 --> 29:34.000
I just arrived at my villa.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.583
<i>Please, sir! I'm sorry!</i>

29:35.583 --> 29:38.416
Stop begging. It'll just make him
more inclined to violence.

29:38.416 --> 29:42.458
You were arrested last month
on smuggling charges.

29:42.458 --> 29:43.458
[dog barks]

29:43.458 --> 29:45.958
And yet, here you are, a free man.

29:45.958 --> 29:46.875
It's odd.

29:46.875 --> 29:48.083
Very odd.

29:48.083 --> 29:50.458
<i>Interpol only knows half the story!</i>

29:51.041 --> 29:52.666
What about the other half?

29:52.666 --> 29:54.625
<i>You should have kept your mouth shut.</i>

29:54.625 --> 29:56.791
<i>Now we are going to shut it for you.</i>

29:56.791 --> 29:59.291
- [Arthur] No!
<i>- Cormac, feed the dog.</i>

29:59.291 --> 30:02.958
- [Arthur] No! Cormac, please!
- [barking and snarling]

30:08.208 --> 30:10.208
[mellow R&B playing on headphones]

30:18.583 --> 30:19.458
What are you doing?

30:19.458 --> 30:21.666
I hope you know your team
have been working all night

30:21.666 --> 30:24.041
and half the day
trying to figure this out.

30:24.041 --> 30:26.291
[Cyrus chuckles]

30:26.291 --> 30:27.958
The teachers hated you, didn't they?

30:27.958 --> 30:29.916
What? No. I was top of the class.
They loved me.

30:29.916 --> 30:32.041
No. They had to pretend
to like students like you

30:32.041 --> 30:34.916
because, technically, you followed
all the rules and got good grades.

30:34.916 --> 30:36.458
What's wrong with that?

30:36.458 --> 30:37.500
It's boring.

30:38.500 --> 30:42.208
Anybody can do what they're told.
Anybody can memorize facts.

30:42.208 --> 30:44.125
Anybody can shine an apple on their ass.

30:44.125 --> 30:47.375
And what were you like?
Class clown? Wiseass?

30:47.375 --> 30:48.583
I was the opposite.

30:49.166 --> 30:50.291
I was silent.

30:50.875 --> 30:53.000
I was watching the kids
look at the blackboard,

30:53.000 --> 30:55.875
answering the questions
where they thought they should answer.

30:55.875 --> 30:57.541
I never looked at the blackboard.

30:58.375 --> 31:01.083
I was looking at the questions
that weren't being asked.

31:01.083 --> 31:02.875
To cool for school, huh?

31:04.208 --> 31:06.541
I saw the path
that they were being marched down,

31:06.541 --> 31:09.833
and I also saw a different path,
a better one for me.

31:09.833 --> 31:10.791
So I took it.

31:10.791 --> 31:12.000
By breaking the rules?

31:12.000 --> 31:14.625
The rules were already broken
for someone like me.

31:14.625 --> 31:17.833
And if I can remember correctly,
you broke a few rules that week in Paris.

31:17.833 --> 31:20.166
Five days! And yes, I did.

31:20.166 --> 31:22.916
I broke the rules
for the first time in my life

31:22.916 --> 31:24.666
and look what good it did me.

31:24.666 --> 31:26.958
- Why do you care about 'em?
- About what?

31:26.958 --> 31:29.583
The rules. Why do you care
so much about the rules?

31:31.291 --> 31:32.250
[sighs]

31:33.666 --> 31:34.500
Okay.

31:37.250 --> 31:38.375
[exhales]

31:39.583 --> 31:41.208
Okay, when I was a kid,

31:42.083 --> 31:44.000
my mom was headmistress at my school.

31:44.625 --> 31:47.416
It was kind of a shithole,
but it had this picture,

31:47.416 --> 31:51.291
a Hockney print that had been given
to the school in the '70s,

31:51.291 --> 31:53.750
and my mum refused to sell it.

31:53.750 --> 31:54.916
[Cyrus chuckles]

31:54.916 --> 31:59.166
Because she wanted us to know
that we deserved beautiful things.

32:00.541 --> 32:04.500
That our school was just as important
as some swanky art gallery.

32:06.250 --> 32:08.416
That we should all dream big.

32:10.875 --> 32:13.041
And then someone stole it.

32:13.875 --> 32:15.125
Middle of the night.

32:15.625 --> 32:16.791
And I thought,

32:16.791 --> 32:18.416
"When I grow up

32:19.333 --> 32:21.333
I'm going to find out who did that

32:22.416 --> 32:23.666
and bring them down."

32:25.125 --> 32:25.958
And did you?

32:28.333 --> 32:29.333
No.

32:31.500 --> 32:33.291
But I did the next best thing.

32:35.166 --> 32:36.208
Interpol.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.166
- Dream big.
- [chuckles]

32:40.041 --> 32:41.083
[sighs]

32:41.083 --> 32:42.291
I admire that.

32:47.666 --> 32:48.750
Oh no.

32:49.708 --> 32:53.500
- No, no, no. I'm not doing this.
- Doing what? What are you talking about?

32:53.500 --> 32:56.208
Getting sucked in
to a conversation with you.

32:56.208 --> 32:58.958
- Conversation. Is that dangerous?
- How did you put it with your team?

32:58.958 --> 33:01.833
"Find the weakness,
do the job, and get out"?

33:01.833 --> 33:03.125
[Cyrus sighs]

33:04.125 --> 33:06.916
- Is that what you think I did?
- I know it is.

33:06.916 --> 33:10.083
I would never lift from anyone
that doesn't deserve to lose it.

33:11.291 --> 33:12.958
And if I do my job well,

33:13.750 --> 33:16.208
well, the thing I took,
they'll never know was missing.

33:16.208 --> 33:18.708
So you're saying we need to take the gold

33:18.708 --> 33:21.458
in a way that Jorgensen
never knows it's missing.

33:21.458 --> 33:23.083
We're not taking the gold.

33:23.583 --> 33:27.541
That's the problem on the blackboard.
We're looking at a different problem.

33:28.125 --> 33:29.666
We are taking the plane?

33:29.666 --> 33:30.625
Nice!

33:30.625 --> 33:33.291
- The whole plane?
- It's kind of hard to take half a plane.

33:33.291 --> 33:35.041
With 250 people on board?

33:35.041 --> 33:38.083
We're not hijacking a plane, Cyrus.
It's not the '70s.

33:38.083 --> 33:40.166
We're not hijacking anything, Camila.

33:40.166 --> 33:42.208
Don't ever use that word.

33:42.208 --> 33:44.833
- We're borrowing it.
- Love it. Love it.

33:44.833 --> 33:46.000
But how?

33:46.000 --> 33:48.208
To take a plane, you gotta fake a plane.

33:48.208 --> 33:51.083
- All you need is a private jet.
- Oh, just like that?

33:51.083 --> 33:54.583
Yeah. If you can get
the planes close enough together,

33:54.583 --> 33:56.500
you can swap the radar signature.

33:56.500 --> 33:59.208
- I like it.
- Pulling up the flight logs now.

33:59.208 --> 34:01.125
See if we know anyone on the sheets.

34:03.708 --> 34:06.916
Drake's Boeing is at Farnborough.
He must have a gig in London.

34:06.916 --> 34:07.916
Too big.

34:09.250 --> 34:10.958
The King's Hawker is at Northolt.

34:10.958 --> 34:12.083
Too small.

- [Mi-Sun] Hmm.

34:13.875 --> 34:16.875
- Oh.
- You're gonna like this.

34:17.458 --> 34:19.875
[laughs]

34:19.875 --> 34:21.666
You want me to give you my jet?

34:21.666 --> 34:23.708
No, I want to rent it.

34:23.708 --> 34:25.666
But there are apps for that, man.

34:25.666 --> 34:29.416
Or I can get my guy N8 to make
an NFT specifically for you.

34:32.875 --> 34:35.458
I don't know. My jet is priceless.

34:35.458 --> 34:38.833
It's a one-off concept model. NASA R&D.

with the mods.

34:43.375 --> 34:44.958
Especially with the glass roof.

34:45.458 --> 34:47.875
I'm not supposed to fly
in American airspace.

34:47.875 --> 34:48.916
[quietly] I do, though.

34:49.625 --> 34:53.833
It's worth it too, to watch the stars
while, you know, you get your groove on.

34:53.833 --> 34:55.083
- Here's the thing--
- Yeah?

34:55.083 --> 34:58.333
You told an officer at Interpol you've
been illegally flying in US airspace.

34:58.333 --> 35:00.458
- But, he--
- [Abby] So how about this?

35:00.458 --> 35:03.666
We take the plane,
and there's nothing you can do about it.

35:06.416 --> 35:08.541
[Mollsen] Everything is remote-controlled.

35:08.541 --> 35:11.833
Doors, lights. Amazing, right?

35:12.583 --> 35:15.333
That is a word that you could use.

35:15.333 --> 35:17.041

35:18.500 --> 35:20.041
Leave it. No, don't sit down.

35:20.041 --> 35:22.416
- Why not?
- Because I don't know what that stain is.

01:13:18.916 --> 01:13:20.625
- [Camila] No, no, no...
- [Cormac] Let's go.

01:13:23.166 --> 01:13:24.166
[Camila sighs]

01:13:25.125 --> 01:13:26.000
What happened?

01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.666
You're working for me now.
We're flying to Tuscany.

01:13:28.666 --> 01:13:32.000
- It's just a little detour. That's all.
- Shut up. You're coming with me.

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.250
- It's not a smart move.
- Interpol knows where we are.

01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:36.291
- They'll follow us.
- Not if they can't see us.

01:13:36.291 --> 01:13:39.708
We were tracking the Airbus the whole way,
and we didn't see this jet.

01:13:40.291 --> 01:13:41.791
So neither will your friends.

01:13:43.833 --> 01:13:45.125
Get the gold on board.

01:13:45.125 --> 01:13:48.291
Wait. Wait, no.
The jet can't take that much weight.

01:13:48.291 --> 01:13:50.083
[Cyrus] That's why we got the trains.

01:13:50.083 --> 01:13:52.583
It's at the end of the runway.
Look, if you don't believe us,

01:13:52.583 --> 01:13:54.416
send one of your guys so they can see.

01:13:54.416 --> 01:13:57.458
Well, I'll take my chances with the jet,
but we'll lighten the load.

01:13:58.041 --> 01:13:59.375
Dispose of him.

01:14:00.166 --> 01:14:03.500
- No. Wait. Wait. Hey! Hey! Hey!
- [Cormac] You two, let's go.

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:04.583
Let's go!

01:14:05.166 --> 01:14:07.500
- [music fades]
- [indistinct announcement on PA]

01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:09.333
[Stefano] Sir! Sir?

01:14:09.333 --> 01:14:10.416
Huh?

01:14:10.416 --> 01:14:12.833
- We just got word from Brussels.
- Uh-huh?

01:14:12.833 --> 01:14:16.291
There was an attempt
to breach the plane's cockpit.

01:14:16.833 --> 01:14:18.208
[sighs] Okay, go on.

01:14:18.208 --> 01:14:19.791
Passengers intervened,

01:14:19.791 --> 01:14:23.916
then they forced a couple passengers
onto a private jet.

01:14:23.916 --> 01:14:27.250
- Well, where's the jet now?
- We are having trouble tracking it, sir.

01:14:27.250 --> 01:14:29.916
Then what are you doing standing here?
Go find it!

01:14:31.541 --> 01:14:34.166
[jet engines roar]

01:14:44.958 --> 01:14:46.666

01:14:47.958 --> 01:14:49.000
You strapped in tight?

01:14:52.791 --> 01:14:53.791
Yes.

01:14:54.583 --> 01:14:55.500
Good.

01:14:57.666 --> 01:14:59.666

What the hell was that?

01:15:12.208 --> 01:15:14.375
- Answer him.
- It's the gold!

01:15:14.375 --> 01:15:16.750
It's throwing us off balance. I told you.

01:15:16.750 --> 01:15:18.250
[quietly] She's not done.

01:15:18.250 --> 01:15:19.750

[plates clang]

01:15:23.958 --> 01:15:26.583
She's shaking off the stealth mods,
isn't she?

01:15:26.583 --> 01:15:27.583
She sure is.

01:15:31.208 --> 01:15:32.333

[goon] <i>Keep it moving!</i>

01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:53.250
Yeah. I'm just not really a gun guy,
so I get a little nervous.

01:15:53.250 --> 01:15:55.625
I mean, you can have
your Second Amendment rights. Do you--

01:15:55.625 --> 01:15:56.750
- [goon] Stop talking!
- Okay.

01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:59.583
- Stop talking. Just keep walking.
- Okay. That is a cool gun.

01:15:59.583 --> 01:16:02.083
I'm guessing the barrel
is carbon nanofiber

01:16:02.083 --> 01:16:04.250
harvested from a vape pen
with liquid propellant.

01:16:04.250 --> 01:16:05.250
That is awesome.

01:16:05.250 --> 01:16:07.833
- Turn around!
- Okay! Okay. Okay.

01:16:07.833 --> 01:16:09.125

01:16:12.625 --> 01:16:14.000
I don't do guns!

01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.166
[goon groaning]

01:16:16.916 --> 01:16:19.083
[Magnus] I'm sorry about the nose,
but we're cool, right?

01:16:19.083 --> 01:16:20.666
I'll go my way, you go yours.

01:16:20.666 --> 01:16:22.833
Okay. I'm good.

01:16:30.125 --> 01:16:31.583
Oh!

01:16:31.583 --> 01:16:32.666
That's...

01:16:32.666 --> 01:16:33.583
Okay.

01:16:33.583 --> 01:16:35.625
You should probably call a doctor!

01:16:35.625 --> 01:16:38.875
We have located the jet, sir.
It's headed toward Italy.

01:16:38.875 --> 01:16:40.750
[Huxley] Doesn't Jorgensen
have property here?

01:16:40.750 --> 01:16:43.833
Yes, there's a villa
under a shell company in Tuscany.

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:45.625
Should we send in the Carabinieri?

01:16:45.625 --> 01:16:47.708
[Huxley] We don't have
hard evidence on him yet.

01:16:49.083 --> 01:16:52.041
Get me a line to NATO.
I'll tell them we have an unidentified jet

01:16:52.041 --> 01:16:54.791
that's a terrorist threat,
and we need to shoot them down.

01:16:55.916 --> 01:16:57.708
But Agent Gladwell could be on it.

01:16:57.708 --> 01:17:00.375
[Huxley] We can't risk
Jorgensen getting that gold.

01:17:01.791 --> 01:17:02.791
Get me NATO.

01:17:03.375 --> 01:17:05.708

to waypoint to confirm visual.

01:17:24.041 --> 01:17:28.208
Oh, Leviathan. Welcome.
Nice to meet some of you in person.

01:17:28.916 --> 01:17:30.125
Where is the gold?

01:17:31.583 --> 01:17:32.625
Ah.

01:17:35.833 --> 01:17:38.500
Leviathan didn't send me here
for small talk.

01:17:39.208 --> 01:17:42.208
[leader] My colleague in Zurich
says your plane did not land.

01:17:42.708 --> 01:17:45.791
That was our plan
to distract the authorities.

01:17:45.791 --> 01:17:47.750
The gold will arrive here.

01:17:47.750 --> 01:17:51.541
Well, I hope so. We don't want
to have to empty all your bank accounts.

01:17:51.541 --> 01:17:52.458
What do you mean?

01:17:52.458 --> 01:17:58.333
The Caymans, Monaco, Panama,
Switzerland, Singapore, and the Maldives.

01:17:58.333 --> 01:18:00.125
We know where your money is.

01:18:00.125 --> 01:18:03.750
And we can make it
all disappear in seconds.

01:18:05.083 --> 01:18:07.208
That's why we only deal in gold.

01:18:07.208 --> 01:18:08.625
Unhackable,

01:18:09.458 --> 01:18:10.541
untraceable.

01:18:12.250 --> 01:18:14.333
It will be here within an hour.
