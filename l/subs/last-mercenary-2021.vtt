12:12.083 --> 12:14.583
[fax machine beeping]

12:14.666 --> 12:16.875
NATIONAL SECURITY
VERY SECRET

12:22.041 --> 12:23.541
-Commander?
-Yes?

12:23.625 --> 12:25.333
-We received a fax.
-A fax?

12:25.416 --> 12:28.375
Yeah. Who sends a fax
with a code that's 25 years old?

12:30.750 --> 12:32.791
A guy who's been gone for 25 years.

12:36.583 --> 12:37.458
[groans]

12:39.000 --> 12:41.666
[Paul] What an asshole! What an asshole!

12:41.750 --> 12:44.500
Someone's getting it.
Glad it's not us. [chuckles]

12:44.583 --> 12:47.416
[Paul] You're an absolute idiot!
You stupid shit! Shit.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.875
-So we have a problem, huh?
-Oh?

12:49.958 --> 12:52.375
Can you explain
what happened with this transfer?

12:52.458 --> 12:53.708
Nothing stood out to you?

12:53.791 --> 12:56.208
Like a red banner
that reads "secret files"

12:56.291 --> 12:59.083
and that flashes,
"No, I'm top secret! Don't touch me"?

12:59.166 --> 13:01.666
Yeah, sure,
but I didn't notice it till I was done.

13:01.750 --> 13:03.291
We agreed you're my boss.

13:03.916 --> 13:05.416
-Yes.
-[Paul] That's settled.

13:05.500 --> 13:08.583
However, you don't do anything
that I don't approve.

13:08.666 --> 13:10.000
Is that too complicated?

13:10.083 --> 13:12.541
Do you get stuck on the word
"until" or "approve"?

13:12.625 --> 13:14.875
Or don't you know
what they mean when they're put together?

13:14.958 --> 13:16.458
Hey, of course I do.

13:17.333 --> 13:20.541
Look, Paul, here's what we do.
I assume full responsibility

13:20.625 --> 13:23.666
as your superior and your leader.

13:23.750 --> 13:24.583
Yes, Paul.

13:24.666 --> 13:27.625
I need you to just quick twitching, okay?

13:27.708 --> 13:28.916
You can count on me.

13:31.208 --> 13:34.250
[man] General, sir, sorry
to drag you out of retirement.

13:35.166 --> 13:37.166
-Madam Minister.
-General.

13:38.750 --> 13:39.750
Jouard.

13:39.833 --> 13:43.333
If I'm understanding,
we're discussing an old agent. Is that it?

13:43.416 --> 13:44.750
Richard Brumère.

13:45.333 --> 13:47.291
Ah, Brumère! I thought he was just a myth.

13:47.375 --> 13:49.625
[Jouard] You should leave. Hugo,

13:49.708 --> 13:53.000
tell Madam Minister
who we're dealing with here.

13:53.083 --> 13:56.083
Commander of the Alpha Section,

13:56.166 --> 13:59.916
a special unit within
the operational division that I commanded.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.416
[men shouting in flashback]

14:01.500 --> 14:04.583
Undetectable, like his code name,

14:04.666 --> 14:05.500
The Mist.

14:05.583 --> 14:06.791
After we let him go,

14:06.875 --> 14:10.125
he became the world's
most celebrated mercenary.

14:10.208 --> 14:11.875
A legend.

14:11.958 --> 14:14.583
-A top pilot, a weapons expert.
-[jet engine roars in flashback]

14:14.666 --> 14:16.791
But when unarmed, he's better.

14:18.750 --> 14:20.416
I saw when it happened.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.666
The Mist took down
a rhinoceros with his bare hands.

14:23.750 --> 14:26.208
-[rhinoceros growls in flashback]
-So the myth goes.

14:26.875 --> 14:29.208
[Hugo] Capable of extracting himself
from any situation.

14:29.291 --> 14:33.291
When my heart quit,
Brumère helped me survive.

14:34.583 --> 14:38.208
Open-heart surgery in the middle
of the savanna with only bamboo.

14:38.291 --> 14:42.166
[chuckles] Come on. It's not like
he's James Bond or something.

14:44.041 --> 14:45.250
1995.

14:46.250 --> 14:47.625
Operation Cup-and-Ball.

14:48.208 --> 14:51.125
For state reasons,
the government cut Brumère loose,

14:51.208 --> 14:54.500
abandoned on the field
and in the hands of the enemy.

14:54.583 --> 14:56.208
[guns firing]

14:56.291 --> 14:57.208
[groans]

14:57.958 --> 14:59.916
-Hello, Colonel.
-[Hugo] Hello, Richard.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.375
-Is Farah there?
-[screams]

15:01.458 --> 15:04.208
-[Hugo] Mr. Minister, it's him.
-[Richard] Put her on.

15:04.833 --> 15:06.875
-No!
-Yes! Yes, put her on!

15:06.958 --> 15:08.708
Yes, yes, yes! Do it!

15:10.208 --> 15:12.083
[phone ringing]

15:12.166 --> 15:13.166
[Farah] Richard?

15:14.250 --> 15:17.000
[speaking Arabic]

15:17.708 --> 15:20.333
-What's she saying?
-It's personal and intimate.

15:20.416 --> 15:23.083
-Private stuff that's between a couple.
-Translate it.

15:23.166 --> 15:25.125
[Farah speaking Arabic]

15:25.208 --> 15:27.291
Uh, there, for example, she just said,

15:27.375 --> 15:29.500
"Enjoy your whore, prick!" [speaks Arabic]

15:29.583 --> 15:31.916
It's gotta be some code of theirs, sir.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.708
[speaking Arabic]

15:34.791 --> 15:37.500
-[continues over phone in Arabic]
-[guns firing]

15:37.583 --> 15:39.000
[shouting in Arabic]

15:39.083 --> 15:41.583
She said we need to cooperate with Richard
and do what she wants.

15:41.666 --> 15:44.750
-Hello, Richard?
-Do what Farah demands.

15:44.833 --> 15:48.750
I'll disappear for good.
The price of my silence.

15:48.833 --> 15:49.666
Okay, Colonel?

15:49.750 --> 15:51.458
[translator] That's the price
we need to pay.

15:51.541 --> 15:53.416
-It's disconnected.
-Did you locate where he is?

15:53.500 --> 15:55.750
Needed more time. Too bad.

15:55.833 --> 15:58.041
-[Farah speaks Arabic]
-It's just like in the movies, huh?

15:58.125 --> 16:01.583
She demands that
her son Archibald's last name be hers.

16:01.666 --> 16:03.500
-Al Mahmoud.
-You can't be serious.

16:03.583 --> 16:05.958
[speaking Arabic]

16:06.041 --> 16:09.750
And that he receive
a monthly allowance for his entire life.

16:09.833 --> 16:11.875
[Farah speaking Arabic]

16:11.958 --> 16:13.708
[continues in Arabic]

16:13.791 --> 16:17.041
Archibald will get immunity for life,

16:17.125 --> 16:19.833
uh, protecting him with a secret defense.

16:19.916 --> 16:21.000
No, Minister, no.

16:21.083 --> 16:23.041
-We're doing it.
-No, you can't, sir.

16:23.125 --> 16:25.125
You want the two of us
to lose our positions, do you?

16:25.750 --> 16:27.791
-No.
-Right, no. So, yes.

16:27.875 --> 16:31.416
-And she wants a babysitter.
-Oh, no. No!

16:31.500 --> 16:33.000
She is totally mocking us.

16:33.083 --> 16:34.750
It's an order of the president.

16:34.833 --> 16:36.541
It is my duty, Minister,

16:36.625 --> 16:38.791
to warn you that this is a huge error.

16:38.875 --> 16:41.791
-[Minister] In any case, we've got him.
-[Hugo] No, he's got us.

16:41.875 --> 16:45.041
If he speaks,
then Cup-and-Ball goes public.

16:46.291 --> 16:47.125
Cup-and-Ball?

16:48.791 --> 16:53.750
-I hoped I'd never hear that name again.
-Well, there we have it. Thank you, Hugo.

16:53.833 --> 16:57.375
You just gave us every possible reason
to go bring down the man.

16:58.541 --> 16:59.416
It's time

17:00.125 --> 17:03.500
to finally rectify
the damage of the 1990s.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.166
We should transfer his son to Brou.

17:06.250 --> 17:08.666
-Uh, Brou?
-Yes, Brou.

17:08.750 --> 17:10.041
In Perche.

17:10.125 --> 17:14.541
Less exotic than Guantanamo
but just as effective.

17:14.625 --> 17:16.833
Do we have
any recent photographs of Brumère?

17:20.500 --> 17:22.416
-[screen beeping]
-That's our man.

17:23.208 --> 17:24.333
What on earth is that?

17:24.416 --> 17:27.125
[Hugo] The summer fair
at Jean-Baptiste Poquelin Middle School.

17:27.208 --> 17:30.208
The Mist
has never been photographed since.

17:31.166 --> 17:32.916
That's right, wiseass.

17:33.625 --> 17:34.708
[imitates gun firing]

17:34.791 --> 17:36.000
[woman] Bournette!

17:36.083 --> 17:37.125
Ah!

17:37.875 --> 17:39.416
-Uh, Commander?
-Hmm?

17:39.500 --> 17:40.875
We just got this in.

17:41.541 --> 17:43.208
A cup-and-ball from Brumère.

17:44.166 --> 17:45.291
Impressive.

17:45.916 --> 17:47.833
I got here feeling confident.

17:47.916 --> 17:49.541
I'll be leaving anxious.

17:49.625 --> 17:50.791
Just you wait.

17:50.875 --> 17:53.375
When the last mercenary returns,

17:53.458 --> 17:54.750
we'll have real action!

17:54.833 --> 17:57.375
[dance music playing]

17:57.458 --> 17:59.041
[crowd chattering, cheering]

17:59.541 --> 18:00.375
[whistling]

18:19.458 --> 18:20.708
A hot towel.

18:22.750 --> 18:24.000
And cashews.

18:24.916 --> 18:25.916
Richard.

18:27.958 --> 18:29.041
[Richard] Marguerite.

18:34.416 --> 18:38.166
Between Fernand's death
and your son's arrest… a tragic day.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.541
[Richard]
They shouldn't have attacked my son.

18:40.625 --> 18:43.291
-Is Jouard still in service?
-More than ever.

18:43.375 --> 18:45.458
Are you looking for him or his wife?

18:45.541 --> 18:48.458
-That's all in the past
-[Marguerite] Not for him.

18:48.958 --> 18:50.791
For him, it's still personal.

18:53.583 --> 18:54.791
Here's your son's file.

18:54.875 --> 18:56.583
He lives in the suburbs.

18:57.083 --> 18:58.041
Hmm.

18:58.125 --> 18:59.875
The kid's been busy.

18:59.958 --> 19:01.708
He made the most of his immunity,

19:01.791 --> 19:03.875
but I guess he apparently
didn't get your discretion.

19:03.958 --> 19:06.000
This isn't what I heard from Fernand.

19:06.083 --> 19:09.791
-He wanted you to believe in him.
-I've seen all his diplomas.

19:09.875 --> 19:12.666
Knowing Jouard,
he'll transfer Archibald to Brou.

19:13.625 --> 19:14.625
Okay.

19:14.708 --> 19:17.375
We're gonna do this one old-school.

19:18.333 --> 19:19.166
[grunts]

19:21.458 --> 19:22.625
You got it.

19:23.875 --> 19:25.000
[sighs]

19:35.208 --> 19:38.125
Archibald Al Mahmoud. Once more.

19:38.208 --> 19:40.416
[indistinct chattering]

20:00.166 --> 20:01.750
[Richard sighs] Farah…

20:01.833 --> 20:05.916
[gentle music playing]

20:06.000 --> 20:07.708
Hmm. [sighs]

20:18.500 --> 20:20.916
[people speaking indistinctly
in background]

20:25.333 --> 20:28.375
[tense music creeping in]

20:30.083 --> 20:31.833
Ah, stop it! Look, I'm just--

20:31.916 --> 20:33.500
Let me go, man! Leave me alone.

20:33.583 --> 20:34.708
Get off of me!

20:35.791 --> 20:39.125
If you think I'll let you rob this place
just because you can do judo, forget it.

20:39.208 --> 20:40.833
Then I'll just break everything.

20:40.916 --> 20:43.125
-You're not taking this.
-[Richard] Wait.

20:43.208 --> 20:44.083
No!

20:44.166 --> 20:46.666
Wait! Stop! That's enough.

20:46.750 --> 20:49.125
Please, put the TV down. There's no need.

20:49.208 --> 20:51.625
Young man… I mean, miss…

20:53.916 --> 20:56.875
-It's "miss."
-[sighs] Excuse me. I wasn't sure.

20:56.958 --> 20:59.333
-You replacing Fernand?
-[Richard] Yes, I'm replacing Fernand.

20:59.416 --> 21:02.333
So then the building authorities
came through for once.

21:02.416 --> 21:05.791
What a mess, such a waste.
Look at the damage.

21:05.875 --> 21:09.166
And who's going to clean this up?
It'll be me. [chuckles]

21:09.958 --> 21:11.000
[glass sweeping]

21:11.083 --> 21:14.125
Tell me, is Archibald… your fiancé?

21:15.041 --> 21:17.208
That dweeb? Shit, man, no.

21:17.291 --> 21:19.916
-He's my brother's friend.
-Oh, your brother.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.875
So he's the leader around here
for your business, hmm?

21:22.958 --> 21:24.833
Archie, a leader? [scoffs, laughs]

21:24.916 --> 21:27.458
Look, man, that kid's a victim, okay?

21:27.541 --> 21:30.375
And him being arrested,
that was some bullshit.

21:30.916 --> 21:32.583
Was this his first arrest?

21:33.416 --> 21:34.625
[glass sweeping]

21:34.708 --> 21:36.916
As a building manager, you snoop too much.

21:37.625 --> 21:38.750
Yes, you're right.

21:38.833 --> 21:40.291
I'm not being productive.

21:41.083 --> 21:43.666
'Cause someone
still needs to take the trash out.

21:44.625 --> 21:45.791
It'll be me. [chuckles]

21:46.375 --> 21:47.958
Hey, I'm watching you, got it?

21:49.750 --> 21:52.750
Yeah, I'm on to you.
Go on, admit that you're a cop.

21:57.750 --> 22:00.458
So what, didn't believe us
when we warned you?

22:00.541 --> 22:01.375
Shit.

22:02.250 --> 22:03.375
Colleagues of yours?

22:03.458 --> 22:05.291
We told you not to deal there
because it's ours!

22:05.375 --> 22:07.958
What's wrong? You confuse it
with your mama's pussy?

22:08.041 --> 22:09.958
Next time, we'll take you down, bitch,
so stop it.

22:10.041 --> 22:12.500
Listen. That's enough. Just stay calm.

22:12.583 --> 22:15.458
Who the hell are you? I'm serious,
you piece of shit. Back off and shut it.

22:15.541 --> 22:17.916
Go shut your mother's mouth.
What you gonna do?

22:18.000 --> 22:19.625
-[grunting]
-You stupid bitch!

22:19.708 --> 22:21.000
You insane? What the hell?

22:21.750 --> 22:22.958
[Richard] Excuse me.

22:23.041 --> 22:25.583
-[coughs] She's mine. Get lost.
-Whoa, whoa. Let's be reasonable.

22:25.666 --> 22:26.708
-I said, go!
-What?

22:26.791 --> 22:28.958
Look, old guy,
get out of the way, or I'll--

22:29.041 --> 22:30.875
-What the hell?
-[grunting]

22:32.208 --> 22:33.916
-[bone cracking]
-Spread the word.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.208
-There's a new janitor in town.
-[whimpering]

22:36.291 --> 22:37.708
-You're sorry?
-[dealer] I'm sorry!

22:37.791 --> 22:38.833
Thank you.

22:38.916 --> 22:41.166
-We're out of here.
-Okay, we're already gone.

22:41.250 --> 22:42.708
Don't bullshit me.

22:43.208 --> 22:45.541
You don't move
like a janitor or a cop either.

22:45.625 --> 22:47.416
But maybe like a secret agent.

22:47.500 --> 22:48.333
Hmm.

22:48.833 --> 22:51.916
What do you want with Archie?
You investigating?

22:55.291 --> 22:56.125
Dalila.

22:58.833 --> 22:59.666
Richard.

23:00.250 --> 23:02.083
[Dalila] Cool. So listen up.

23:02.791 --> 23:04.666
You'll investigate this case with me.

23:04.750 --> 23:07.333
Because Fernand was a good man,
and Archie's family.

23:08.000 --> 23:09.625
So you're stuck with me, got it?

23:10.333 --> 23:11.166
[groans]

23:11.250 --> 23:12.083
Okay.

23:12.833 --> 23:13.791
[clears throat]

23:15.416 --> 23:16.250

23:17.125 --> 23:18.000
Fernand…

23:18.083 --> 23:20.958
[delicate music playing]

23:22.666 --> 23:25.333
[music turns tense]

23:25.416 --> 23:26.541
It's missing an ear.

23:29.416 --> 23:30.333
[Dalila] So what?

23:33.541 --> 23:34.375
[exhales deeply]

23:34.458 --> 23:37.208
Djibouti, back in 1993.

23:40.333 --> 23:42.833
[mechanical whirring]

23:45.291 --> 23:46.125
[Dalila] Whoa.

23:47.250 --> 23:48.166
[whooshing loudly]

23:54.875 --> 23:57.958
[mysterious music playing]

23:58.041 --> 23:59.416
Whoa.

24:02.125 --> 24:03.708
What is this though?

24:03.791 --> 24:04.833
A panic room.

24:05.416 --> 24:07.583
[Dalila] Hold on,
Fernand has a panic room?

24:07.666 --> 24:08.916
This is sick!

24:09.000 --> 24:10.166
[electronic beeping]

24:10.250 --> 24:13.583
No way! He surveilled everything?

24:13.666 --> 24:16.291
That's why nobody dealt in these streets.

24:16.375 --> 24:19.833
Fernand made sure that Archibald
was raised in a protected place.

24:20.750 --> 24:21.708
What's that?

24:22.291 --> 24:23.333
Wow, guys.

24:23.416 --> 24:24.416
Oh?

24:25.458 --> 24:28.291
Don't ignore me. I'm not gonna leave.
So what happened?

24:28.375 --> 24:30.625
At some point, you're gonna have
to work with me, you know.

24:32.083 --> 24:35.625
Way I see it, you're all by yourself,
and I bet you could use my help.

24:37.750 --> 24:39.791
Archie was dealing weapons?

24:39.875 --> 24:42.708
No, impossible. That wasn't him.
I mean, in Grand Theft Auto, okay.

24:42.791 --> 24:46.875
Fernand suspected that someone
used the immunity Archibald had.

24:48.250 --> 24:49.458
Archie has immunity?

24:50.625 --> 24:52.500
Mac Virtual Block System.

24:52.583 --> 24:54.875
Why would he put this in here?

24:55.750 --> 24:57.416
[sighs] Big Mac?

24:58.833 --> 25:01.291
Known internally as the Big Mac.

25:02.166 --> 25:04.791
A weapon developed back in the early '90s.

25:04.875 --> 25:07.375
It was designed to disable
any electronic device.

25:07.458 --> 25:08.500
I mean, that's sick!

25:08.583 --> 25:10.333
Oh, no, no, no, no.

25:10.416 --> 25:14.583
This weapon is serious, okay?
It causes too much collateral damage.

25:15.791 --> 25:18.208
A simple pacemaker would stop.

25:18.291 --> 25:20.291
It's like the other day,
in just two seconds,

25:20.375 --> 25:22.583
I remember there was
a total blackout here.

25:22.666 --> 25:24.625
I mean, even people's phones stopped.

-[Richard] Yeah.

25:38.291 --> 25:41.125
-[Dalila] Oh, shit. Police?
-They're special agents.

25:41.208 --> 25:43.625
The kind of agents
who operate unofficially.

25:44.625 --> 25:45.833
Bingo.

25:49.041 --> 25:49.875
The Big Mac.

25:50.916 --> 25:53.041
You… you obviously got
the wrong Fernand Bouchard.

25:53.125 --> 25:55.458
A lot of guys have that name.
Give me a phone. I'll call him.

25:55.541 --> 25:57.708
Fernand Bouchard… was murdered!

25:58.291 --> 26:00.750
-Okay? So stop jerking us around, kid!
-But that's not possible.

26:00.833 --> 26:02.791
-Got it? There was no Fernand Bouchard.
-There was…

26:02.875 --> 26:04.791
He was really Fernand Eisenberg!

26:04.875 --> 26:06.958
Aka, "Plasticizer," retired special ops.

26:07.041 --> 26:09.291
And as you see, he's dead.
He can't tell us anything.

26:09.375 --> 26:11.833
You wanted to take over the business,
is that it? Is that right?

26:11.916 --> 26:13.625
-No, no, no!
-[woman] Tell us everything!

26:13.708 --> 26:15.041
[man] Look at the picture!

26:15.125 --> 26:16.875
Know what? You'll be put in prison!

26:16.958 --> 26:19.458
And with that little angel face,
you won't make it two days!

26:19.541 --> 26:21.875
So what will it be?
A cell with a little ping-pong

26:21.958 --> 26:24.500
or a little bit of ping-pong in your ass?

26:24.583 --> 26:26.791
-It's not possible. No.
-[woman] It is. Now talk!

26:26.875 --> 26:28.666
-Talk! Spill!
-Come on! You're dead!

26:39.375 --> 26:41.708
[man 2] Yeah, well, uh,
I'll… I'll check it out right away.

26:41.791 --> 26:43.875
[man 1] Yeah, you do that, Omar.

26:44.375 --> 26:45.208
You do that.

26:46.333 --> 26:48.791
-[Omar] You still got the money?
-[man in room with man 1] Yeah.

26:49.625 --> 26:50.791
And I got the yayo.

27:02.875 --> 27:05.291
-[Paul on phone] I need your papers back.
-My ID?

27:05.375 --> 27:07.500
No, no way! I'm not giving that shit back.

27:07.583 --> 27:09.166
-[Paul] We have a problem.
-Hey!

27:09.250 --> 27:11.708
-This isn't what you promised me.
-[Paul] But we have a problem.

27:11.791 --> 27:14.291
Did you forget that I have
restricted entry and am here illegally?

27:14.375 --> 27:15.583
You don't need to scream, okay?

27:15.666 --> 27:17.750
[man in room] What part
of that don't you understand?

27:17.833 --> 27:20.208
[Paul] I'm asking for your sake.
It's no skin off my back.

27:20.291 --> 27:22.625
-I have a team of lawyers.
-Who do you take me for, prick?

27:22.708 --> 27:26.083
You wanna fuck with Simyon?
No one fucks with Simyon, got that?

27:26.166 --> 27:28.875
It's me who does the fucking around here!
Got it? Hey!

27:28.958 --> 27:32.791
-You need to stop. I can hear you.
-[Simyon] Shove your Big Mac up your ass!

27:32.875 --> 27:36.291
You'll be sorry, all of you shitheads!
Suck my dick, asshole!

27:36.375 --> 27:38.250
-Hello?
-[phone line clicks, beeping]

27:39.958 --> 27:43.083
The man hangs up.
[scoffs] I'm doing you a favor.

27:43.166 --> 27:45.125
-[indistinct chattering]
-What you got on Big Mac?

27:45.208 --> 27:49.333
The project is temporarily on hold.
There's been no sign of the prototype.

27:50.000 --> 27:51.791
What about moving my son Archibald?

27:51.875 --> 27:55.500
It'll have to be quick. It'll be tomorrow.
They just need to get the last signature.

27:57.708 --> 27:58.833
What's going on?

27:59.666 --> 28:01.500
I remember you differently, Richard.

28:02.333 --> 28:06.000
Yeah, right. How am I supposed to, uh…

28:07.875 --> 28:10.000
I'd get the team back together fast.

28:10.083 --> 28:13.208
I'm not much of a fighter anymore,
but I'm here if you need me.

28:13.291 --> 28:15.041
No, no. How does someone

28:15.916 --> 28:18.958
be introduced to their only son?

28:19.541 --> 28:22.000
I don't know about all that.
I've never been a mom.

28:22.708 --> 28:24.666
I suppose you could write something.

28:24.750 --> 28:26.583
A letter. That's great.

28:26.666 --> 28:27.500
A letter.

28:28.208 --> 28:29.708
Be careful, Richard.

28:30.250 --> 28:33.041
You've always spent your time
saving others, but this…

28:33.750 --> 28:35.500
It gets tricky when it's personal.

28:38.375 --> 28:40.375
An operation is still an operation.

-[horn honks]

28:45.458 --> 28:48.416
[man on radio] The entire route's
been mapped out, as instructed.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.125
It's his son. He'll be there.

28:50.208 --> 28:53.125
If he fires his weapon, then shoot.
It's self-defense.

28:53.208 --> 28:56.458
If he doesn't, shoot him down.
It's self-defense.

28:57.083 --> 28:59.208
Just tell me
when the kid's been picked up.

28:59.291 --> 29:01.125
Commander, they picked the kid up earlier.

29:01.208 --> 29:04.333
-We made our move now so…
-What do you mean? Who picked him up?

29:04.416 --> 29:05.416
Our officials.

29:06.500 --> 29:10.000
Look, I'm positive our protocol
was pristine. I promise.

29:10.083 --> 29:13.166
We even have a scanned copy of
the transfer document from the president.

29:13.250 --> 29:14.166
This proves it.

-Joe! Where are we going?
-[Richard] There's no time. Come on.

-Get in.
-There's no way I'm getting in that car!

-Because I'm also mourning Fernand.

33:38.541 --> 33:40.625
[Archibald] No, no, no, no, no! [grunts]

33:40.708 --> 33:42.166
[screaming]

33:46.416 --> 33:48.916
[panting] Who are they?

33:49.000 --> 33:50.208
We turned right.

33:50.291 --> 33:52.375
-We just turned right.
-Did we lose them?

33:53.041 --> 33:53.875
No.

33:53.958 --> 33:54.833
[panting]

33:54.916 --> 33:56.583

33:56.666 --> 33:57.750
[brakes squeaking]

34:03.791 --> 34:05.041
[yelps]

34:13.333 --> 34:14.291
Just breathe.

34:14.375 --> 34:16.708
[hyperventilating] Okay, I'm breathing.

34:18.791 --> 34:20.333
[worker 1] Get down!

34:20.416 --> 34:23.250
-What's happening?
-[worker 2] Are you crazy?

34:23.333 --> 34:25.708
[shouts, gasps]

34:25.791 --> 34:30.375
♪ One way or another
I'm gonna get ya, I'll get ya… ♪

34:30.458 --> 34:32.458
[both yelling]

34:33.833 --> 34:36.500

Get out of the way!

34:37.000 --> 34:39.083

[sighs]

34:47.041 --> 34:47.875
[whimpers]

34:47.958 --> 34:49.500
Slow on the brake.

34:53.208 --> 34:54.666
Well, my dear boy,

34:55.166 --> 34:56.208
you failed.

34:56.791 --> 34:58.250
[children laughing]

35:00.166 --> 35:02.208
[Archibald] All that
just to come back here?

35:12.750 --> 35:13.625
Dalila?

35:15.791 --> 35:16.625
Hey, Archie.

35:17.291 --> 35:19.416
-[Archibald] Hey.
-Sorry about Fernand.

35:20.291 --> 35:23.250
I gotta say it's pretty badass,
you getting away.

35:23.333 --> 35:24.500
You freak out at all?

35:24.583 --> 35:27.000
Me? Seriously? Come on.

35:27.500 --> 35:29.791
That so? You were a bit scared.

35:29.875 --> 35:33.083
Unless you like to scream
even when you're not scared, hmm?

35:33.166 --> 35:34.583
We had a little hiccup.

35:35.083 --> 35:36.583
Just a little hiccup, huh?

35:36.666 --> 35:39.125
Excuse me for not keeping my cool
while being shot at.

35:39.208 --> 35:41.166
-They fired at you?
-From all sides.

35:41.250 --> 35:43.166
Everywhere. You know each other?

35:43.750 --> 35:45.583
You're lucky to be friends with her.

35:46.083 --> 35:47.583
Real attracts real, bro.

35:51.375 --> 35:54.208
How do I explain Brumère's son escaping
to the president?

35:54.291 --> 35:57.291
All our officers are on his trail,
Madam Minister.

35:57.375 --> 35:59.125
And this guy? Can he help?

35:59.208 --> 36:01.833
-Did you stop the bank transfer?
-Yes.

36:02.458 --> 36:04.625
-So you know Brumère?
-No.

36:04.708 --> 36:08.125
He says he was just following
a pointless notice.

36:08.208 --> 36:10.083
[scoffs] Yes. That's mine.

36:11.125 --> 36:13.875
Excuse me, Madam… Minister.

36:13.958 --> 36:16.250
I-- Well-- Oh, you know what I mean.

36:16.333 --> 36:18.666
There's no way
he's an accomplice to Brumère.

36:18.750 --> 36:20.458
Yes, that's for sure.

36:20.958 --> 36:23.291
-He's not the brightest bulb.
-[Jouard] No, he's not.

36:23.375 --> 36:24.458
So then?

36:24.541 --> 36:27.458
Unless we use this
to our advantage, Minister.

36:28.708 --> 36:30.625
Are you saying
you're going to use him as bait?

36:30.708 --> 36:32.000
Yeah.

36:33.041 --> 36:35.166
He is a member
of the government after all.

36:35.666 --> 36:36.916
Yeah.

36:37.000 --> 36:39.958
So then… let's set bait, Jouard.

36:40.041 --> 36:41.083
Yeah.

36:43.416 --> 36:45.791
I will be sure you get yours.

36:46.541 --> 36:47.958
[chuckles] Fernand,

36:48.708 --> 36:49.708
secret agent.

36:51.083 --> 36:53.291
You know, your dad is a secret agent too.

36:53.375 --> 36:55.791
Look… I don't give a shit.

36:55.875 --> 36:58.083
I know his name's Richard,
and that's enough.

36:59.416 --> 37:00.583
Who are you again?

37:01.500 --> 37:02.458
Call me George.

37:03.583 --> 37:05.916
-George?
-George, yeah, George.

37:06.750 --> 37:08.833
[Archibald] George. [chuckles]

37:08.916 --> 37:11.125
I can't let you talk
about Richard that way.

37:11.708 --> 37:14.708
You'd abandon your own son,
would you, George?

37:15.791 --> 37:16.625
Of course not.

37:20.333 --> 37:22.500
In pain… George?

37:23.875 --> 37:26.500
A bit of shrapnel
lodged between vertebrae.

37:27.250 --> 37:28.666
Hurts every once in a while.

37:28.750 --> 37:30.125
What do they want with me?

37:30.208 --> 37:32.125
Someone used your identity
for illegal weapons.

37:32.208 --> 37:33.458
But why me?

37:33.541 --> 37:37.125
Your father gave you the gift
of total immunity. So there.

37:37.208 --> 37:40.541
But what kind of father decides
that breaking the law is a gift?

37:41.458 --> 37:43.125
Says a lot about the guy.

37:43.791 --> 37:46.250
Well, actually, I believe
it was your mom's idea.

37:46.333 --> 37:49.958
You obviously never met her.
I bet you got that from the other guy.

37:50.041 --> 37:51.416
The other guy who saw to it

37:51.500 --> 37:53.791
that you receive a bit
of monthly allowance, huh?

37:53.875 --> 37:55.250
Wait, you get money too?

37:55.333 --> 37:57.375
Yeah, mm, pocket cash.

37:57.458 --> 37:58.291
Pocket cash?

37:58.833 --> 38:00.625
1,540 euros each month?

38:00.708 --> 38:02.833
It's all thanks to the government. My…

38:02.916 --> 38:03.750
Listen.

38:04.833 --> 38:07.041
The government made
your problems, Archibald.

38:07.125 --> 38:09.500
My father's the reason
they murdered Fernand.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.750
My real dad is gone because of Richard.

38:15.416 --> 38:16.333
[sighs]

38:20.083 --> 38:23.541
Absolutely insane.
I was at the lockers… [laughs]

38:23.625 --> 38:25.375
It makes me laugh just to remember.

38:25.458 --> 38:28.625
So I'm getting changed, and I'm putting
the clothes into the locker but then--

38:28.708 --> 38:30.125
Enough! Shut up, you idiot!

38:30.208 --> 38:32.291
-I see you're still upset.
-[Simyon] Shut up!

38:32.375 --> 38:33.208
Fine. Okay.

38:33.833 --> 38:35.458
I guess supposedly there's, um,

38:36.125 --> 38:38.541
this guy making problems.
Nothing really. It's just that…

38:38.625 --> 38:40.750
-No need to--
-What's with the bullshit, hassa?

38:41.250 --> 38:43.333
-Do you know what a hassa is, Paul?
-Yes.

38:43.416 --> 38:46.000
-A hassa is a pig that--
-[Paul] That doesn't fly straight.

38:46.083 --> 38:48.291
I know, from Scarface.
The script is badass.

38:48.375 --> 38:51.416
And did you know
Oliver Stone wrote the script?

38:51.500 --> 38:53.208
Bullshit. It was Tony Montana.

38:53.791 --> 38:54.916
Um…

38:55.000 --> 38:57.916
Tony Montana's just some character
in the film, not a real--

38:58.000 --> 39:00.791
-Enough! I don't wanna hear it.
-Yes, exactly. You're absolutely right.

39:00.875 --> 39:03.833
I can't move product without my passport.

39:04.583 --> 39:05.458
[sighs]

39:05.541 --> 39:07.541
-If my dad finds out, I'm dead.
-And me?

39:07.625 --> 39:09.416
And if I'm dead, the deal's off. Got it?

39:09.500 --> 39:11.291
-Nyet, over, nada.
-What?

39:11.375 --> 39:13.750
Oh, no, please, Simyon,
we have to go through with it.

39:13.833 --> 39:15.791
-Shit, we're men of honor.
-Listen up, egghead.

39:15.875 --> 39:18.083
Got it? With your ball-shaped face.

39:18.166 --> 39:20.458
In this life, my honor
comes from my word and my dick.

39:20.541 --> 39:23.291
Idea. [chuckling]

39:23.375 --> 39:25.500
[makes buzzing noise] I'm on to something.

39:25.583 --> 39:28.291
The idea's that we arrange
a little delivery to seal the deal.

39:29.083 --> 39:31.791
-You want Uber Eats?
-[Paul] A Big Mac delivered to your door.

39:31.875 --> 39:32.708
We have a deal?

39:34.625 --> 39:36.250
-Ooh, ahh. Oh, yeah.
-[laughing]

39:36.333 --> 39:37.583
Very funny, like always.

39:38.166 --> 39:41.458
-Lazare.
-No. No, no, no. Come on, give me a break.

39:41.541 --> 39:43.291
For two hours,
I explained to your colleagues

39:43.375 --> 39:44.833
that I was just following the note.

39:44.916 --> 39:48.916
We don't think that you're the accomplice
of public enemy number one.

39:49.000 --> 39:51.208
-[sighs] Well, thank God.
-Rest assured.

39:51.875 --> 39:52.750
[sighs]

39:52.833 --> 39:54.666
It's more likely that you would be

39:55.250 --> 39:56.416
his target.

39:57.250 --> 39:58.875
-Huh?
-You have nothing to fear.

39:59.666 --> 40:02.541
-Uh, I mean, don't I?
-Not at all.

40:02.625 --> 40:05.458
We'll hook you up
with a microphone and a tracker.

40:05.541 --> 40:08.958
Of course, there might be problems,
so take my card.

40:09.041 --> 40:11.625
I don't give it out often.
You're a lucky man.

40:11.708 --> 40:14.708
You're saying
that if I'm being shot at, uh,

40:15.500 --> 40:17.458
-I should give you a call?
-Yes.

40:17.958 --> 40:19.166
But not after 7:00.

40:19.250 --> 40:22.416
-And not on Fridays. That's the Sabbath.
-This seems wrong.

40:27.791 --> 40:29.416
Are you gonna tell him you're his dad?

40:31.166 --> 40:33.000
As the proverb of Issa says,

40:34.041 --> 40:37.541
"The camel might be
without water for many weeks,

40:37.625 --> 40:39.875
but it drinks whenever it can."

40:40.958 --> 40:41.833
Okay, so what?

40:42.625 --> 40:43.625
What's your point?

40:44.208 --> 40:46.208
Well, I'm waiting for the right moment.

40:46.791 --> 40:48.666
Now, I wrote him a letter.

40:50.458 --> 40:52.416
-It's great.
-[Dalila] No, that's crap.

40:52.500 --> 40:54.708
[Archibald] No, no, I'll never tell you!

40:54.791 --> 40:57.333
[mumbling] No! [gasping]

40:57.416 --> 41:00.708
Are you sure he's your son?
Because, I mean, look at him.

41:00.791 --> 41:02.541
Yeah, I did a test. Hmm.

41:02.625 --> 41:05.500
-What? Are you serious?
-It's normal. I had my doubts.

41:07.458 --> 41:09.000
So Archie's mom was just a booty call?

41:09.083 --> 41:12.791
I won't be lectured
by someone who sells drugs.

41:13.750 --> 41:16.250
I've done some bad things in my life.

41:16.875 --> 41:18.250
But doing drugs?

41:18.750 --> 41:19.583
Not me.

41:21.166 --> 41:23.041
It's what pays my way through school.

41:23.541 --> 41:26.583
Life is different
not having a dad… or money.

41:26.666 --> 41:29.375
-[Archibald] I don't like dandelions!
-What are you studying at school?

41:29.458 --> 41:30.833
Don't worry about it.

41:31.416 --> 41:34.708
Anyway, I was busy
while you were saving your "maybe" son.

41:34.791 --> 41:37.208
Fernand took multiple pictures
of the same car.

41:38.458 --> 41:41.833
The car's plates were registered
to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

41:43.041 --> 41:46.208
The Ministry's in charge
of Archibald's immunity.

41:47.041 --> 41:48.833
It's owned by Alexandre Lazare.

41:50.041 --> 41:51.833
Want to tell me how you know that?

41:52.333 --> 41:53.833
Let's just say I have contacts,

41:53.916 --> 41:56.250
and they do a lot of work
with cars and plates.

41:57.000 --> 41:57.833
I bet.

41:59.416 --> 42:01.541
Magnum and Jeroboam.

42:01.625 --> 42:03.291
A couple of mercenaries.

42:04.250 --> 42:07.583
Hired by the government
for their special operations.

42:11.125 --> 42:12.083
You're a mercenary?

42:14.000 --> 42:15.625
[inhales, exhales deeply]

42:16.291 --> 42:18.333
[Hugo] Cup-and-Ball is ancient history.

42:18.416 --> 42:21.833
I've told you before
that during that infamous mission,

42:21.916 --> 42:27.416
Richard and your wife were suspected daily
of being a fake couple on their honeymoon.

42:27.500 --> 42:28.625
So how can I put this?

42:29.208 --> 42:32.750
Well, Richard decided
that he'd better preserve their cover, so…

42:32.833 --> 42:35.333
That sack of shit! He slept with my wife!

42:35.916 --> 42:37.291
He boned my wife, okay?

42:37.875 --> 42:39.833
Ah, they consummated it.

42:39.916 --> 42:41.291
But no one but Richard

42:41.375 --> 42:44.250
could have been able
to have taken on that challenge.

42:44.333 --> 42:45.708
They had a flame-thrower!

42:45.791 --> 42:47.833
Yes, General, we get the picture.

42:48.416 --> 42:51.583
Madam Minister, he took my wife.

42:52.083 --> 42:55.083
That guy just banged her.

42:56.250 --> 42:58.833
A fool. A fool!

42:58.916 --> 43:01.458
For eight weeks after that,

43:01.541 --> 43:02.500
she was glowing!

43:03.208 --> 43:04.333
Listen, Guy,

43:05.541 --> 43:08.500
the republic will not forget
your sacrifice. That I can promise.

43:08.583 --> 43:12.083
What worries me is if the bastard
puts a team together again.

43:12.583 --> 43:14.291
They're barbarians on the field.

43:14.375 --> 43:16.916
Merciless, causing rebellion.

43:17.000 --> 43:21.000
They're merciless and brutal men!

43:21.083 --> 43:23.166
-And bloodthirsty killers!
-Let go, Archie!

43:23.250 --> 43:24.541
-[Jouard] Godless!
-Give it to me!

43:24.625 --> 43:25.833
-Stop it!
-[Jouard] Lawless!

43:25.916 --> 43:27.541
-Just let go!
-Archie, let it go.

43:27.625 --> 43:29.083
-[Richard] No phones.
-There, you see?

43:29.166 --> 43:30.166
There, you see?

43:35.541 --> 43:37.416
Archibald, I need Dalila

43:37.500 --> 43:38.958
to pay Lazare a visit.

43:39.041 --> 43:40.000
I need you to stay.

43:40.083 --> 43:43.000
-What? I'm being left alone?
-What part of this don't you get?

43:43.083 --> 43:46.000
You're wanted, Archie.
They'll kill you, you hear me?

43:46.083 --> 43:48.750
-More reasons to be together then, right?
-Just trust me on this one.

43:48.833 --> 43:52.500
As long as you're in here,
nothing bad can happen, Archibald.

43:52.583 --> 43:54.625
Okay. You can call me Archie.

43:55.541 --> 43:57.625
Archibald. It works! [chuckles]

43:57.708 --> 44:00.833
Look, just call me Archie, please, George.
Archibald sounds like a clown's name.

44:00.916 --> 44:02.833
-[Dalila] George…
-Okay, Archie.

44:07.083 --> 44:09.625
[Lazare] "Meet in one hour.

44:14.666 --> 44:16.083

Do you have a cigarette
I can bum off you? Do you?

44:47.708 --> 44:50.125
-Uh, no. I don't have any.
-Come with us.

44:50.208 --> 44:51.750
-Let's go.
-But what'd I do?

44:51.833 --> 44:53.000
Goodbye, madame.

44:54.750 --> 44:55.583

44:56.541 --> 44:57.916
[girl] Hey, let me go!

44:58.000 --> 45:00.625
[sighs] Where is he? Where is he?

45:00.708 --> 45:01.625

-Hello?
-[Richard] Lazare? It's Brumère.

45:26.625 --> 45:27.708
It's Brumère!

45:29.625 --> 45:31.916
It's Brumère! It's Brumère!

45:32.000 --> 45:33.333
The guy's an idiot.

45:35.333 --> 45:36.666
Are you alone?

45:37.250 --> 45:40.125
Yes, I'm alone.
I'm not… I'm… I'm not with the cops.

45:44.375 --> 45:46.000
No mic on me either. Not at all.

45:46.083 --> 45:48.041
-There you have it.
-An idiot.

45:48.125 --> 45:49.541
[Richard] Turn around.

45:49.625 --> 45:51.750
-Put the helmet on.
-Okay.

45:55.333 --> 45:56.666
[Richard] Can you hear me?

45:57.166 --> 46:00.166
-Okay, I can hear you.
-[Richard] And change your outfit.

46:00.250 --> 46:03.041
What? Uh, what do you mean?
What do I change into?

46:03.125 --> 46:06.625
[Richard] I forgot to mention.
There's an explosive in the helmet. C-4.

46:06.708 --> 46:09.041
You have ten minutes
to reach your destination.

46:09.125 --> 46:12.333
Ah, this isn't okay!
This isn't an outfit! [screams]

46:12.416 --> 46:14.375
If you take it off, boom!

46:14.458 --> 46:16.708
It's heating up! Move! Hurry!

46:16.791 --> 46:18.375
I'm sorry! Sorry!

Coming though! I can't… [screams]

-Whoo! [shouting]

-[Richard] Turn left.
-It's burning! It's burning!

46:35.000 --> 46:36.583
I mean, at least he's easy to spot.

46:36.666 --> 46:38.875
Hey, man, don't give
last-minute turns, okay?

46:38.958 --> 46:40.500
Please, I'm in my underwear!

-[Richard] Come on, come on. Faster!
-[screaming]

47:02.916 --> 47:04.250
-[Richard] Faster!
-Please, no!

47:04.333 --> 47:06.333
You're not the one
with the bomb strapped to his ear!

47:06.416 --> 47:08.833
-[Richard] Faster! Faster!
-Please, I'm doing my best here.

47:08.916 --> 47:10.166
I'm not Schumacher!

47:10.250 --> 47:11.750
See what you're making me do?

47:11.833 --> 47:13.791
[Richard] Just so you know,
three minutes left.

47:13.875 --> 47:16.375
Excuse me! Whoa-ho-ho-ho-ho!

47:16.458 --> 47:18.625
Watch out! I'm sorry!

47:18.708 --> 47:21.291

-[woman screams]

47:22.500 --> 47:24.208

47:24.291 --> 47:26.833

I'm on the wrong side!

[horns honking]

47:27.833 --> 47:29.583
[Lazare screaming]

47:31.666 --> 47:33.041
[Richard] Turn under the arches.

47:33.125 --> 47:36.208
Fine, but I'm tell you,
I'm not doing an entire tour of Paris!

47:36.291 --> 47:37.541
-[screams]
-Watch out, watch out!

47:37.625 --> 47:39.666
Hey, but scooters
aren't supposed to be here.

47:39.750 --> 47:41.750
[Richard] You also shouldn't be
half naked in public.

47:41.833 --> 47:45.625
I'm on a scooter in my underwear!
Your plan isn't very discrete.

47:45.708 --> 47:46.666
[people screaming]

47:46.750 --> 47:48.125
[yelling]

47:48.208 --> 47:50.875
Sorry, my bad! I can't stop!

47:50.958 --> 47:53.958
-[Richard] And turn left.
-I don't wanna die!

47:59.916 --> 48:01.833
-It's not difficult.
-[Lazare panting]

48:03.791 --> 48:06.250
-It's him! It's him!
-[officer 1] Don't move! Don't move!

48:23.083 --> 48:24.875
Yo, Brumère. [panting]

48:26.416 --> 48:29.666
Since I'm freezing my ass off,
could you get me out of this thing?

48:29.750 --> 48:31.250
[grunts, screams]

48:31.333 --> 48:34.625
-[siren passes]
-[panting] Is it… is it deactivated?

48:35.458 --> 48:36.375
[grunts]

48:36.458 --> 48:39.000
-What?
-The explosives were burning my cheeks.

48:39.083 --> 48:42.291
-Ah, it's not rigged.
-What? It's not rigged?

48:42.375 --> 48:44.500
You're stressed. It's stress.

48:45.833 --> 48:46.666
Come on.

48:47.416 --> 48:48.458
Go get changed.

48:49.208 --> 48:50.166
In there.

48:51.250 --> 48:53.791
No. No, no, no, no, no. I'm not doing it.

[Lazare] Hey, what's the idea?
You never told me the rules, okay?

[metal music playing on headphones]

49:05.541 --> 49:06.500
[grunts]

49:08.416 --> 49:10.291
If you're going to torture me with music,

49:10.375 --> 49:12.875
couldn't you have picked
something a little calmer?

49:12.958 --> 49:16.250
More relaxing? Beethoven. Bach.

49:16.333 --> 49:18.500
-No? Nothing? [yelps]
-Sorry.

49:18.583 --> 49:20.750
[mechanical clicking]

49:23.958 --> 49:25.916
-You went out?
-[Archibald] Me? No way.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.333
It was getting a little stuffy,
and I needed some air.

49:28.416 --> 49:31.083
-[Richard] Smells different in here.
-[Lazare] See you later! [yells]

49:31.583 --> 49:32.708
[Richard] Turn around.

49:33.750 --> 49:36.208
[Lazare grunting]

49:41.333 --> 49:42.833
I have been briefed, sir.

49:43.583 --> 49:45.000
I know that you want revenge

49:45.500 --> 49:48.208
against the republic.
But I won't say anything!

49:48.291 --> 49:49.125
Buddy…

49:50.750 --> 49:51.583
[exhales deeply]

49:51.666 --> 49:55.791
Contact. I met the killers
that are behind what you've been doing.

49:55.875 --> 49:58.250
Yeah, sure, the killers.
You're exaggerating,

49:58.333 --> 50:01.750
but… it's true, we do have
excellent bureau operating.

50:02.583 --> 50:04.500
Your excellent colleagues
tried to kill me.

50:04.583 --> 50:06.333
Well, I'd love to be helpful.

50:07.291 --> 50:08.583
I don't see how.

50:08.666 --> 50:11.541
The gun they shoved under my nose,
I saw that just fine.

50:12.625 --> 50:14.083
Who canceled the bank transfer?

50:16.625 --> 50:19.166
It was, uh, individually motivated.

50:24.625 --> 50:26.083
[Richard] Is that your car?

50:26.166 --> 50:27.083
Your team?

50:29.375 --> 50:30.833
Yeah, that's… that's my car,

50:30.916 --> 50:34.500
but… I don't use it
because I'm against getting advantages.

50:35.500 --> 50:38.875
And… I've never seen them before.

50:38.958 --> 50:41.750
Your father was
the scapegoat for Cup-and-Ball.

50:41.833 --> 50:43.500
-My father was innocent.
-[Richard] I know.

50:43.583 --> 50:46.375
And their scapegoat
for this operation is you.

50:48.041 --> 50:49.708
Meaningless lies. No.

50:50.208 --> 50:52.833
And don't be spreading lies.
I am nobody's scapegoat.

50:55.708 --> 50:58.333
Jacques, your grandfather, a diplomat.

50:58.416 --> 50:59.625
Back in 1940,

50:59.708 --> 51:02.958
he didn't hesitate when pledging
his allegiance to the Resistance

51:03.041 --> 51:05.541
even though collaborating
would have been the easy option.

51:05.625 --> 51:07.333
Ah, you were pals with Grandpa Jacques?

51:08.458 --> 51:10.166
-We're not the same age.
-Yes.

51:10.250 --> 51:14.041
Uh, yeah, but he did that
just to combat the Nazis. Hmm.

51:14.125 --> 51:15.833
Papa Jacques wasn't a rat.

51:17.166 --> 51:18.416
Here's what we do.

51:18.916 --> 51:20.416
You're my accomplice,

51:21.000 --> 51:23.625
and you'll finish your days in jail.

51:23.708 --> 51:25.166
[chuckling]

51:26.083 --> 51:29.041
Oh, no, I mean, you…
you're way off, my friend.

51:29.125 --> 51:31.041
In jail? [chuckling]

51:31.125 --> 51:33.250
[Richard in Lazare's voice]
So did you like the scooter?

51:33.333 --> 51:35.458
It's revenge for Cup-and-Ball,
you piece of shit!

51:35.541 --> 51:37.791
Ah, just like the Terminator.

51:37.875 --> 51:39.458
No. No!

51:39.541 --> 51:41.708
One call to the Ministry is enough!

51:41.791 --> 51:44.000
-You wouldn't do that.
-[in normal voice] Yeah.

51:44.083 --> 51:46.416
Come on. Let us in on what you know!

51:46.500 --> 51:48.500
What… what about Grandpa Jacques?

51:48.583 --> 51:49.458
[sighs]

51:50.375 --> 51:51.875
I'm not happy about this.

Paul.

51:53.958 --> 51:57.125
-He's the only one that uses the car.
-[Archibald and Richard] Paul?

51:57.208 --> 51:59.791
Paul. Paul Lesueur, my subordinate.

52:00.916 --> 52:03.583
Although he gave me the job.
A bit weird, huh?

52:04.166 --> 52:07.625
Very smart, because then he can say
he was following your orders.

52:09.041 --> 52:10.625
I mean, he doesn't think I'm that stupid.

52:14.625 --> 52:16.666
Archibald, so you went out?

52:16.750 --> 52:19.916
No. No. No, I didn't. I've been here.

52:20.000 --> 52:22.041
-Yes, you went out.
-Did not. I didn't go out.

52:22.125 --> 52:23.916
-Did you go out?
-I would tell you if I did.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.375
-I've just been here.
-Yes or no?

52:25.458 --> 52:28.000
Yes, I went out!
I was depressed, do you get that?

52:28.083 --> 52:31.250
I thought I'd better go see Momo
rather than do something crazy.

52:31.750 --> 52:34.041
-Helmet, shades.
-No! No, no, no.

52:34.125 --> 52:36.291

Look, couldn't we take
a break from this, huh?

52:38.375 --> 52:39.208

54:34.583 --> 54:36.625
-Archie…
-[Archibald] No, no, no, no, no.

54:36.708 --> 54:38.416
I was prepared to give you a letter.

54:40.041 --> 54:43.708
-It's important I tell you now--
-Yes! [laughs]

54:43.791 --> 54:45.958
Fernand! I love you, Dad!

54:46.041 --> 54:49.416
[Lazare] I'm not a seer,
no pun intended, but I can sense a change.

54:52.166 --> 54:53.000
-No…
-Yes.

54:53.083 --> 54:56.708
Well, but you seem to overestimate
my sense of direction.

54:56.791 --> 54:59.375
[beeping]

54:59.458 --> 55:02.750
-Dalila? Where are you? Close?
-[Dalila over radio] In position, George.

55:02.833 --> 55:04.250
[explosion rumbles]

55:05.833 --> 55:07.541
It's a bit warm, right?

55:08.500 --> 55:10.333
[coughing]

55:10.416 --> 55:12.416
[Dalila] Come on, come on. Hurry, hurry.

55:12.500 --> 55:14.833
Come on, come on. Go, go, go!

55:14.916 --> 55:16.583
-[Archibald] Go!
-[Dalila] Come on, come on.

55:16.666 --> 55:18.958
Hurry, hurry. Go, go. Come on, get in.

55:19.958 --> 55:21.541
Come on, go, Momo! Drive.

55:23.708 --> 55:25.166
[tires squealing]

55:29.833 --> 55:32.291
[inhales, exhales deeply]

55:34.041 --> 55:35.125
-[Magnum] Boss.
-Hey.

55:35.958 --> 55:37.125
Problem solved.

55:37.208 --> 55:38.916
-[Paul] Yes!
-Definitely, boss.

55:39.000 --> 55:40.000
[Paul] My man!

55:40.083 --> 55:41.541
[phone beeps off]

55:41.625 --> 55:42.958
You know what we did?

55:43.666 --> 55:47.208
We eliminated the Mist.
We exploded the legend.

55:48.625 --> 55:50.291
[both screaming]

55:50.375 --> 55:52.083
[both grunting]

55:53.958 --> 55:56.041
[Richard] Your weakness
led the enemy to HQ, okay?

55:56.125 --> 55:56.958
BUTCHER

55:57.041 --> 56:01.041
-You put everybody in danger. Everybody!
-Come on, man, give him a break.

56:01.833 --> 56:03.208
I was feeling depressed.

56:04.583 --> 56:08.708
Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen,
I'm here, and I exist.

56:08.791 --> 56:11.875
And I've had about enough of this crap.
I don't know anything!

56:11.958 --> 56:13.625
I am manhandled,

56:13.708 --> 56:16.541
and you blow down my neck.
I'm in disguise!

56:16.625 --> 56:18.500
I'm done being your puppet!

56:18.583 --> 56:20.166
And I'm sick of this playlist!

56:20.250 --> 56:23.083
He's right. It's true. What do we do?

56:23.166 --> 56:26.541
Uh, Mr. Agent, uh,
just wanna see if I can get a gun up here

56:26.625 --> 56:29.333
because it's not that secure at all. Over.

56:32.625 --> 56:36.208
So the explosion was in the front.
We found a hidden room in the ruins.

56:36.291 --> 56:38.625
Looks like their hideout.
There's nothing left.

56:38.708 --> 56:39.958
Any bodies recovered?

56:40.041 --> 56:43.291
Let's just hope we find
pieces of the Mist in there.

56:48.291 --> 56:50.083
Lazare was with the Mist.

56:50.750 --> 56:52.958
All in one fell swoop.

56:53.625 --> 56:57.041
Such a shame that a member
of the government paid with his life.

56:57.125 --> 56:59.791
-Bless that poor man.
-Amen.

56:59.875 --> 57:02.333
[Richard] The guys who tried to blow us up

57:02.833 --> 57:04.208
knew that you were with us.

57:06.041 --> 57:10.250
Now, it'd be best if we could find out
if this Paul guy is one of them.

57:10.333 --> 57:11.166
Paul…

57:12.166 --> 57:13.416
What a disappointment.

57:13.500 --> 57:14.333
So?

57:15.291 --> 57:16.833
Are you prepared, rookie?

57:18.416 --> 57:23.250
Microphone… on his collar.
And under his coat.

57:26.791 --> 57:29.375
You know, the secret service
is very suspicious,

57:29.458 --> 57:33.041
and so I'd better give you…
just a few bruises.

57:33.125 --> 57:38.000
Listen, I've put up with a lot.
I've cooperated. Uh, now I draw the line.

57:38.083 --> 57:41.541
He who wants to approach a lion
should look like a gazelle.

57:43.416 --> 57:44.250
Huh?

57:46.291 --> 57:47.916
No, I mean, so what?

57:48.500 --> 57:50.625
Ah, this won't be painful,

57:50.708 --> 57:54.125
but visually, well, it's believable.

57:54.208 --> 57:56.041
Look, I'm fine if it doesn't hurt.

57:56.666 --> 57:57.833
Then come on.

57:58.333 --> 57:59.583
Here or here? [chuckles]

58:03.625 --> 58:04.458
-[gasps]
-[yelps]

58:04.541 --> 58:06.291
[people exclaiming]

58:08.125 --> 58:09.041
[Lazare groans]

58:10.708 --> 58:11.541
Hello, hello.

58:13.625 --> 58:14.833
Uh, Alexandre?

58:16.958 --> 58:19.708
You're… you're ali…
I mean, you're not dead. I mean, you're…

58:19.791 --> 58:21.000
[mumbling] Alive.

58:21.083 --> 58:22.916
He's alive. He's alive. Whoo!

58:23.000 --> 58:25.666
[distortedly] I managed
to get away from Richard.

58:27.291 --> 58:28.500
I… I didn't catch that.

58:28.583 --> 58:33.375
[mumbling]

58:33.458 --> 58:34.916
Sounds like Bantu.

58:35.000 --> 58:37.708
-Huh? What?
-Bantu, an African dialect.

58:37.791 --> 58:39.208
-You serious?
-Yes.

58:39.291 --> 58:40.666
-Right.
-[mumbling]

58:41.333 --> 58:43.250
[growls, mumbles]

58:43.333 --> 58:44.166
Is he yelling?

58:44.250 --> 58:46.041
[mumbling]

58:46.125 --> 58:48.291
[sighs] We can't do this. This is stupid.

58:48.375 --> 58:50.041
[wheezing, whooshing]

58:50.125 --> 58:51.500
Sing it, maybe?

58:51.583 --> 58:53.125
-[distortedly] Brumère.
-No.

58:53.208 --> 58:54.666
[splutters, mumbles]

58:54.750 --> 58:56.750
-[Paul] Shh.
-[mumbling]

58:56.833 --> 59:00.000
-Is it…
-Ca… ca… caress, maybe?

59:00.083 --> 59:01.291
-Or ass?
-No!

59:01.375 --> 59:04.208
I swear, no, he just said to you,
"Have a good day."

59:04.291 --> 59:05.875
-Yes. [chuckles]
-All good?

59:05.958 --> 59:07.125
Right, then.

59:07.208 --> 59:08.375
[mumbles]

59:08.458 --> 59:12.375
Listen, Lazare, did Brumère
mention anything that seemed bizarre?

59:12.458 --> 59:14.166
Did he show you someone's picture?

59:14.250 --> 59:17.500
Maybe he showed you a picture
of… her or me? [chuckles nervously]

59:17.583 --> 59:19.083
[mumbling]

59:19.666 --> 59:21.125
No? Okay, okay.

59:21.208 --> 59:24.166
All right. So what we'll do is,
you stay here. You stay here please.

59:24.250 --> 59:25.291
Okay? Don't move.

59:25.916 --> 59:27.000
Just stay.

59:27.083 --> 59:28.000
[Lazare mumbles]

59:28.500 --> 59:29.416
[grunting]

59:29.500 --> 59:31.500
Hello? Yes. Yes, he's alive.

59:38.083 --> 59:40.541
-[gasps]
-[distortedly] Oh. Can I get a coffee?

59:41.375 --> 59:42.250
Huh?

59:45.250 --> 59:48.375
[bouncy music playing]

59:50.500 --> 59:51.458
[mumbles]

59:56.750 --> 59:57.750
[grunts]

59:57.833 --> 59:58.875
[distortedly] Shit.

1:00:10.166 --> 1:00:11.125
The mic.

1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:13.083
The mic!

1:00:13.166 --> 1:00:15.000
[breathing heavily]

1:00:21.666 --> 1:00:23.666
[Paul] So as soon as things
go wrong, it's my fault.

1:00:23.750 --> 1:00:25.041
No, I'm not gonna take this!

1:00:25.125 --> 1:00:26.250
[distortedly] Crap.

1:00:27.833 --> 1:00:29.208
[gasping]

1:00:30.416 --> 1:00:31.375
[grunts]

1:00:31.458 --> 1:00:33.625
[Paul] When it goes wrong,
I'm to blame? No.

1:00:33.708 --> 1:00:36.791
Sorry, but no way. Look,
tomorrow he's gonna come to the pool.

1:00:37.375 --> 1:00:39.375
We'll set a date for it.
After that, it'll be done.

1:00:39.458 --> 1:00:40.375
[Lazare snoring]

1:00:42.083 --> 1:00:44.416
Can I call you back? Love you.

1:00:47.250 --> 1:00:49.708
-[continues snoring]
-[snapping fingers]

1:00:49.791 --> 1:00:51.458
[whistling]

1:00:52.708 --> 1:00:54.208
[continues snoring]

1:00:58.041 --> 1:00:59.375
Shh.

1:01:00.916 --> 1:01:03.750
[suspenseful music playing]

1:01:03.833 --> 1:01:04.666
[door opens]

1:01:04.750 --> 1:01:05.916
-Morning.
-[Paul grunts]

1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:07.666
[Bournette] Is Lazare here?

1:01:07.750 --> 1:01:09.000
[Paul] What? Who?

1:01:09.083 --> 1:01:11.333
-Alexandre Lazare. Is he here?
-Uh, yeah.

1:01:11.416 --> 1:01:13.541
Yeah, he's here. Resting.

1:01:13.625 --> 1:01:15.750
So maybe…
[whispers] …be quiet in the meantime.

1:01:15.833 --> 1:01:18.458
We need him for questioning, I'm afraid.
Let's go.

1:01:18.541 --> 1:01:19.500
[snaps fingers]

1:01:20.833 --> 1:01:22.000
[keyboard clacking]

1:01:22.083 --> 1:01:23.083
[Lazare mumbling]

1:01:23.166 --> 1:01:24.916
[Bournette] Big eggs…

1:01:26.583 --> 1:01:28.333
[mumbling]

1:01:28.416 --> 1:01:30.291
-[distortedly] Big eyes!
-Ah, his eyes.

1:01:30.375 --> 1:01:32.375
-His eyes. His eyes.
-[mumbling]

1:01:32.458 --> 1:01:33.750
You mean that?

1:01:33.833 --> 1:01:36.416
[mumbling]

1:01:36.500 --> 1:01:37.666
-"Dick"?
-[mumbles]

1:01:37.750 --> 1:01:40.458
-Just keep it clean, can you please?
-[chuckles]

1:01:40.541 --> 1:01:43.458
[distortedly] No, it's, uh… More. Bigger!

1:01:43.541 --> 1:01:45.750
-Ah, more. A bit bigger.
-[grunts]

1:01:45.833 --> 1:01:48.250
-Okay?
-[distortedly] More. That's it. That's it!

1:01:48.333 --> 1:01:51.208
That's it, that's it,
that's it, that's it. There. Stop!

1:01:51.708 --> 1:01:53.166
There! [gasps]

1:01:53.250 --> 1:01:54.625
That's him. See?

1:01:54.708 --> 1:01:58.833
[mumbling] Ladies and gentlemen,
let me introduce you to Richard Brumère.

1:01:59.708 --> 1:02:01.458
-Are you sure?
-[distortedly] Yeah!

1:02:02.291 --> 1:02:04.125
See… uh…

1:02:04.208 --> 1:02:06.750
Okay. Now we're pushing Homer Simpson.

1:02:06.833 --> 1:02:07.666
I mean…

1:02:09.541 --> 1:02:11.708
[distortedly] It's Richard Brumère.

1:02:11.791 --> 1:02:13.625
-Okay.
-[distortedly] Ah, no, no, no.

1:02:13.708 --> 1:02:16.083
-It is!
-That's him? That's Brumère?

1:02:16.166 --> 1:02:17.833
-Right.
-[distortedly] That's Brumère.

1:02:17.916 --> 1:02:20.041
Well? Do we have anything?

1:02:20.125 --> 1:02:21.833
What's he looking like these days?

1:02:21.916 --> 1:02:22.833
Um…

1:02:25.000 --> 1:02:26.166
He's, uh…

1:02:26.250 --> 1:02:28.791
[tense music playing]

1:02:39.041 --> 1:02:40.000
That's it.

1:02:41.458 --> 1:02:42.833
I recognize him.

1:02:43.500 --> 1:02:45.083
King of camouflage.

1:02:45.875 --> 1:02:47.666
Well-done, you asshole.

1:02:48.666 --> 1:02:50.208
-Good.
-[distortedly] Yeah.

1:02:50.291 --> 1:02:52.416
-[Jouard] Very good.
-[distortedly] Very good. Yeah.

1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:56.000
[Momo] Go, go, go, go, go!

1:02:57.250 --> 1:02:59.166
[Richard over radio] Go! Go, Momo! Go!

1:02:59.250 --> 1:03:00.708
[tires squealing]

1:03:02.541 --> 1:03:04.958
[mumbling]

1:03:06.416 --> 1:03:07.250
What?

1:03:07.333 --> 1:03:11.916
[continues mumbling]

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:14.958
Paul, tomorrow,
he will meet the buyer at the pool.

1:03:15.041 --> 1:03:17.791
-Wait, you mean you got that?
-[Richard] Of course.

1:03:17.875 --> 1:03:22.958
All I did was numb his hyoglossus muscle
to inhibit consonants that are percussive.

1:03:23.041 --> 1:03:24.833
[mumbling]

1:03:24.916 --> 1:03:27.458
Now we need
a safe place to spend the night.

1:03:28.333 --> 1:03:30.458
Sewers would do it. Or the woods.

1:03:30.541 --> 1:03:33.291
Yeah, first priority, guys,
find a good sewer.

1:03:33.375 --> 1:03:35.291
Uh, Richard, the sewers won't work.

1:03:35.375 --> 1:03:36.791
They are totally secure.

1:03:37.416 --> 1:03:39.666
Unless someone has another option…

1:03:39.750 --> 1:03:41.916
[chuckles] …more secure
to be for the night

1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:43.916
that no one else knows of.

1:03:46.875 --> 1:03:48.916
[mumbles, chuckles]

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:51.833
[continues mumbling]

1:03:51.916 --> 1:03:53.041
[laughing]

1:03:53.625 --> 1:03:54.625
He's got a hideout.

1:03:54.708 --> 1:03:56.291
Uh, you pole dance?

1:03:57.041 --> 1:04:00.541
[less distortedly] Yes, I do pole dancing.
It's a sport like any other.

1:04:00.625 --> 1:04:03.333
-You'll have to give us a demo.
-No. No, no, no.

1:04:03.416 --> 1:04:04.875
No, I'm not warmed up yet.

1:04:05.583 --> 1:04:07.125
Well, I'm burning up. [grunts]

1:04:07.208 --> 1:04:08.041
No.

1:04:08.541 --> 1:04:10.791
-[dance music playing]
-No.

1:04:10.875 --> 1:04:13.833
Okay. Let me see. Whoa!

1:04:14.541 --> 1:04:17.250
-[Dalila chuckling]
-[Momo] Yeah, that's how it's done.

1:04:17.750 --> 1:04:18.708
Yeah!

1:04:18.791 --> 1:04:20.125
[Dalila laughing]

1:04:20.208 --> 1:04:22.541
-Sure, laugh it up. Go ahead.
-[Momo] Yeah!

1:04:22.625 --> 1:04:25.916
I mainly keep it a secret
so I don't get laughed at like that.

1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:28.583
-[laughing continues]
-This is how it's done. Ha!

1:04:28.666 --> 1:04:29.916
I love the pole.

1:04:30.000 --> 1:04:32.791
-I'm one with the pole.
-That's bad. That's not it.

1:04:32.875 --> 1:04:35.708
Apparently, it's acrobatic.

1:04:36.208 --> 1:04:38.625
-[grunts]
-It's excellent for the dorsal muscles.

1:04:38.708 --> 1:04:41.250
Ah! You see that? Did you hear?

1:04:41.333 --> 1:04:44.458
Your dad appreciates
the unique perspective of this sport.

1:04:44.541 --> 1:04:47.708
[chuckling] What do you mean, my dad?
Who's my dad? [laughing]

1:04:47.791 --> 1:04:50.250
-Who? I mean, he's… he's right here.
-[all laughing]

1:04:50.333 --> 1:04:52.416
-Who?
-[all laughing]

1:04:52.500 --> 1:04:54.708
You're confused, man. George isn't my dad.

1:04:54.791 --> 1:04:56.083
[chuckling]

1:04:56.166 --> 1:04:57.791
But you're Richard Brumère.

1:04:58.291 --> 1:04:59.958
Huh? He's "the Mist."

1:05:01.375 --> 1:05:02.375
Is that you?

1:05:03.125 --> 1:05:05.125
-Yes.
-There you go.

1:05:05.208 --> 1:05:08.125
The father of Archibald Al Mahmoud.

1:05:08.208 --> 1:05:09.833
[chuckles] That would be you.

1:05:13.708 --> 1:05:14.583
Uh…

1:05:15.208 --> 1:05:18.458
You are… Uh, yeah,
but I mean, you all knew that, right?

1:05:22.083 --> 1:05:23.500
So that's his dad?

1:05:23.583 --> 1:05:24.416
Come on.

1:05:25.125 --> 1:05:25.958
Is it?

1:05:27.708 --> 1:05:31.791
Man, it's no big surprise.
There are, you know, certain similarities.

1:05:33.791 --> 1:05:35.541
Well, not really.

1:05:35.625 --> 1:05:39.333
Uh, I should give you all
some, uh, family time.

1:05:40.250 --> 1:05:42.625
Please turn off the light, Momo.

1:05:42.708 --> 1:05:44.541
Archibald, I can explain.

1:05:45.291 --> 1:05:46.125
[Archibald] No.

1:05:46.625 --> 1:05:49.833
If you hadn't been called out,
it'd go unsaid.

1:05:50.416 --> 1:05:53.166
Under the circumstances,
it was better to wait.

1:05:53.250 --> 1:05:54.833
[Archibald] The circumstances?

1:05:54.916 --> 1:05:57.333
You're an even bigger coward
than I thought!

1:05:57.416 --> 1:06:00.083
That's not true.
He came here to protect you.

1:06:02.916 --> 1:06:04.208
What is this shit?

1:06:04.791 --> 1:06:06.333
[crying]

1:06:06.416 --> 1:06:07.250
[sighs]

1:06:07.333 --> 1:06:08.166
Hey, Archie!

1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:09.833
Bro!

1:06:10.416 --> 1:06:12.000
I mean, it could be worse, man.

1:06:15.708 --> 1:06:16.916
You better go after him.

1:06:18.083 --> 1:06:19.083
Me?

1:06:21.125 --> 1:06:23.208
What if maybe you go instead, huh?

1:06:23.291 --> 1:06:24.708
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

1:06:26.375 --> 1:06:29.958
That bullet you've got in your spine,
you sure it's not just emotional?

1:06:30.791 --> 1:06:33.291
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-I do. It's psychology.

1:06:34.541 --> 1:06:37.250
It's my undergrad.
I'm just scratching the surface.

1:06:37.750 --> 1:06:39.541
But I can see
you've carried this a long time.

1:06:45.916 --> 1:06:47.666
[footsteps departing]

1:06:51.416 --> 1:06:52.250
[door closes]

1:06:57.375 --> 1:06:58.500
[sighs]

1:07:02.250 --> 1:07:05.291
You know, one day
I was on a mission, in Chad.

1:07:06.583 --> 1:07:09.208
It had seemed we'd lost and given up.

1:07:09.708 --> 1:07:13.250
That day, I took five bullets, .22s. Yeah.

1:07:13.833 --> 1:07:16.541
I was put in a trunk and handcuffed

1:07:16.625 --> 1:07:18.833
and then thrown off a cliff.

1:07:20.500 --> 1:07:21.333
[exhales deeply]

1:07:21.416 --> 1:07:22.875
You should be dead.

1:07:22.958 --> 1:07:23.791
No.

1:07:23.875 --> 1:07:27.916
The hope of seeing you again
gave me the strength to break the lock

1:07:28.583 --> 1:07:29.750
with my teeth.

1:07:29.833 --> 1:07:30.708
[teeth crunching]

1:07:31.791 --> 1:07:33.000
Three molars were lost.

1:07:33.083 --> 1:07:35.208
[gentle music playing]

1:07:35.291 --> 1:07:38.208
And because speeches aren't my strength,

1:07:38.875 --> 1:07:40.125
I decided… [grunts]

1:07:40.208 --> 1:07:42.583
…I'd better write
a letter to help explain.

1:07:44.666 --> 1:07:46.333
No, I don't want your excuses.

1:07:46.958 --> 1:07:49.708
Look, this is simple. You weren't my dad.

1:07:52.375 --> 1:07:54.458
It was to keep you both safe.

1:07:54.541 --> 1:07:56.875
No, it was because
you wanted your own life.

1:07:58.541 --> 1:07:59.666
Farah, your mother,

1:08:00.375 --> 1:08:01.750
she and I met on a mission.

1:08:03.875 --> 1:08:04.708
And you…

1:08:06.916 --> 1:08:08.541
my son had arrived.

1:08:09.708 --> 1:08:11.791
There is a rule within the service.

1:08:11.875 --> 1:08:13.291
Don't get attached.

1:08:14.708 --> 1:08:16.458
Okay. I get it.

1:08:17.083 --> 1:08:18.208
I was in the way.

1:08:22.708 --> 1:08:23.916
I loved your mother.

1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:29.000
And yet, when she got cancer, you were…

1:08:29.916 --> 1:08:32.875
-Getting tortured in Chad.
-Sure, you were being tortured in Chad!

1:08:32.958 --> 1:08:35.833
-Yes.
-Fernand wasn't being tortured in Chad.

1:08:35.916 --> 1:08:39.291
Fernand was there till she had
her last breath. He was there for me!

1:08:39.375 --> 1:08:41.333
[emotional music playing]

1:08:41.416 --> 1:08:42.416
[choking up]

1:08:47.125 --> 1:08:48.750
[Archibald] He's my real father.

1:08:51.500 --> 1:08:52.708
You're not.

1:08:54.000 --> 1:08:54.958
Archibald…

1:08:55.041 --> 1:08:57.458
And stop calling me Archibald.
My name's Archie!

1:08:58.041 --> 1:08:59.166
Archie, okay?

1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:04.416
Oh, bathrooms aren't in here.
Okay, got it.

1:09:05.000 --> 1:09:07.250
Archibald is the name of your grandpa.

1:09:07.333 --> 1:09:08.166
[door closes]

1:09:17.416 --> 1:09:19.000
[breathing heavily]

1:09:23.375 --> 1:09:24.333
Breakfast!

1:09:24.416 --> 1:09:25.583
What? Huh?

1:09:25.666 --> 1:09:29.166
Whoa, I had a crazy nightmare.
I thought I missed breakfast.

1:09:29.250 --> 1:09:32.166
All right, team, Operation Pool Day.

1:09:32.250 --> 1:09:34.333
We need to identify the buyer,

1:09:34.416 --> 1:09:36.875
what time and where
the Big Mac will be sold.

1:09:38.583 --> 1:09:40.708
Do you think that the buyer
is pretending to be Archie?

1:09:40.791 --> 1:09:41.875
Yes.

1:09:41.958 --> 1:09:46.291
Right. Well, I mean,
the sale of your "hamburger"

1:09:46.375 --> 1:09:47.541
isn't my problem.

1:09:47.625 --> 1:09:51.208
First we need that impostor.
My name needs to be cleared, all right?

1:09:51.291 --> 1:09:52.291
That's what matters.

1:09:52.375 --> 1:09:54.208
I first need to get to Big Mac

1:09:54.291 --> 1:09:57.291
because we need to protect
the safety of France, Archibald.

1:09:57.375 --> 1:10:02.083
Well, I mean, you think I give a shit
about that? This is about my life here!

1:10:02.166 --> 1:10:03.791
Don't you see that?
So I'm coming with you.

1:10:03.875 --> 1:10:06.875
Archibald, if the beard endowed wisdom,

1:10:06.958 --> 1:10:08.916
then all goats would become prophets.

1:10:10.583 --> 1:10:11.833
-What?
-Sorry.

1:10:13.250 --> 1:10:15.833
Armenian proverb. Hmm.

1:10:15.916 --> 1:10:17.500
What? You maniac!

1:10:17.583 --> 1:10:20.958
-Isn't that a bit intense, Richard?
-Just untie me! Dalila!

1:10:21.833 --> 1:10:22.916
Dalila!

1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:25.291
Momo, help me! [grunts]

1:10:25.375 --> 1:10:26.875
It's for your own safety, bro.

1:10:26.958 --> 1:10:28.875
[chuckles] Momo, just untie me.

1:10:28.958 --> 1:10:31.041
-Momo!
-So how about that gun?

1:10:31.125 --> 1:10:33.041
-Here we go.
-I'm a completely different person…

1:10:33.125 --> 1:10:34.833
Untie me! You guys, what the hell?

1:10:34.916 --> 1:10:39.250

[Dalila] I don't trust her. I mean,
why would he go there with her and not me?

1:11:00.833 --> 1:11:04.208
-You jealous or what?
-Jealous of what? Of her? [scoffs]

1:11:04.291 --> 1:11:05.750
Look, he likes the old lady.

1:11:05.833 --> 1:11:09.041
See, me and Richard,
when considering this operation,

1:11:09.125 --> 1:11:10.916
we knew she had specific skills.

1:11:11.000 --> 1:11:13.166
And what she can do you're not able to do.

1:11:13.250 --> 1:11:14.916
Not yet. You could learn.

1:11:15.541 --> 1:11:17.958
-Anyway, the lady's badass.
-Just do your job, watchdog.

1:11:18.041 --> 1:11:20.416
-[Richard on phone] Stretch your legs.
-I'm doing my job.

1:11:20.500 --> 1:11:22.833
[Richard] That's it, Mrs. Wolf.

1:11:22.916 --> 1:11:26.541
-Again. Deep breaths.
-[Dalila] Richard, everything good?

1:11:26.625 --> 1:11:29.750
-We're good. He's here.
-[Dalila] Okay. Stay in position.

1:11:31.291 --> 1:11:32.750
[phone rings]

1:11:33.833 --> 1:11:34.666
Yes, Paul.

1:11:35.750 --> 1:11:37.166
-Where the hell are you?
-Right.

1:11:37.250 --> 1:11:39.791
It's just that I won't be
at the transaction today as planned

1:11:39.875 --> 1:11:40.916
because it's too risky--

1:11:41.000 --> 1:11:42.583
Why's it risky, huh?

1:11:43.166 --> 1:11:44.833
-What about our big sale?
-Shh.

1:11:44.916 --> 1:11:46.875
Did you just shush me? Listen to me!

1:11:46.958 --> 1:11:49.333
Listen to me!
I'm not going to be shushed, okay?

1:11:49.416 --> 1:11:51.791
I didn't mean to say, "Shh."
It practically slipped out.

1:11:51.875 --> 1:11:54.458
Angelo, I'm starting
to get a little tired.

1:11:54.541 --> 1:11:57.750
-Just a bit longer, Mrs. Wolf.
-No, really. No, I've had enough.

1:11:57.833 --> 1:12:00.500
Right! Big Mac? What now?

1:12:00.583 --> 1:12:02.416

-[grunts] Marguerite, what are you doing?

-It's either tonight or never, coño.

1:16:03.166 --> 1:16:04.916
-[straining]
-[water splattering]

1:16:06.041 --> 1:16:07.500
[gasps]

1:16:08.125 --> 1:16:09.583
[gagging]

1:16:10.208 --> 1:16:11.833
[yelling]

1:16:11.916 --> 1:16:12.875
[both groaning]

1:16:12.958 --> 1:16:16.041
Terrorist! Terrorist!

1:16:16.125 --> 1:16:17.875
-[grunts]
-[shouts]

1:16:19.375 --> 1:16:20.375
[Magnum] Come here!

1:16:21.583 --> 1:16:23.916
[lively music swelling]

1:16:26.833 --> 1:16:28.416
[groaning]

1:16:31.791 --> 1:16:32.708
[grunting]

1:16:36.583 --> 1:16:37.416
Archibald?

1:16:38.333 --> 1:16:39.916
[groans] Yes.

1:16:47.666 --> 1:16:49.875
-Hey, ladies. Ready to twerk?
-[Taser clicks]

1:16:50.791 --> 1:16:51.916
[water flowing]

1:16:56.500 --> 1:16:59.208
-[electricity fizzling]
-[spluttering]

1:17:06.375 --> 1:17:08.750
Oh, you want to play? Okay!

1:17:08.833 --> 1:17:11.083
Say hello to my little friend! [yelling]

1:17:11.166 --> 1:17:13.333
[rapid gunfire]

1:17:16.208 --> 1:17:19.541
You really wanna mess with me, do you?
Let's go! [yelling]

1:17:19.625 --> 1:17:20.625
[gunshot rings out]

1:17:22.375 --> 1:17:26.000
It's me, Archibald Al Mahmoud!

1:17:31.208 --> 1:17:32.833
Way to choose your team, huh?

1:17:35.041 --> 1:17:37.666
And you, Archie,
you're actually gonna get us killed.

1:17:37.750 --> 1:17:38.958
Quit acting crazy.

1:17:39.041 --> 1:17:42.500
No. You don't get to be like that, okay?
Just stop already.

1:17:44.583 --> 1:17:45.416
Yeah.

1:17:45.500 --> 1:17:48.375
-Water was really never my thing.
-We noticed.

1:17:49.958 --> 1:17:51.625
I can't manage this mission.

1:17:53.125 --> 1:17:54.791
I can't manage you.

1:17:54.875 --> 1:17:56.458
So now it's my fault?

1:17:57.791 --> 1:17:59.291
Typical. I'm to blame.

1:18:02.166 --> 1:18:03.416
I really wanted to help.

1:18:06.916 --> 1:18:07.750
I know.

1:18:12.375 --> 1:18:13.375
[door opens]

1:18:22.208 --> 1:18:25.166
To be honest, Mr. Agent,
if you'd given me a gun, well,

1:18:25.250 --> 1:18:27.208
we'd be celebrating a win right now.

1:18:30.375 --> 1:18:33.041
-Oh.
-[groaning]

1:18:33.125 --> 1:18:35.083
It's just a tiny scratch.

1:18:35.791 --> 1:18:38.208
But now we know the buyer.

1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:40.541
Simyon Novak.

1:18:40.625 --> 1:18:42.625
Son to the king of Taarghistan?

1:18:43.416 --> 1:18:45.000
He isn't allowed in France.

1:18:45.083 --> 1:18:48.375
Paul Lesueur made fake IDs
with Archibald's name

1:18:49.666 --> 1:18:52.583
so he could sell
the Big Mac without interference.

1:18:52.666 --> 1:18:54.500
He's doing a home delivery tonight.

1:18:55.916 --> 1:18:57.750
I'd love some Mickey D's right now.

1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:01.125
Were you able to get his passports?

1:19:01.208 --> 1:19:03.458
I only got to grab his cell phone.

1:19:03.958 --> 1:19:05.416
[Momo] Wow. Really?

1:19:05.500 --> 1:19:07.750
It's a six-hour flight to Taarghistan.

1:19:08.708 --> 1:19:10.333
Kind of far for a delivery.

1:19:10.833 --> 1:19:13.625
How would you get to, uh, Taarghistan

1:19:14.416 --> 1:19:15.750
and not get on a plane?

1:19:18.166 --> 1:19:20.333
-[Dalila and Archibald] The embassy!
-Bingo.

1:19:20.833 --> 1:19:23.375
We'll have to catch them with the device,

1:19:23.458 --> 1:19:25.208
recover the Big Mac,

1:19:25.291 --> 1:19:27.041
and head off Paul and Simyon.

1:19:27.708 --> 1:19:28.833
I mean, that's great!

1:19:28.916 --> 1:19:32.041
And plus, Simyon's father
even forced his son to come home.

1:19:32.125 --> 1:19:35.375
That jerk won't give us
any more trouble now. [laughing]

1:19:36.208 --> 1:19:38.416
-Is that bad?
-Of course it's bad.

1:19:38.500 --> 1:19:40.833
If there's no sale,
there's no proof, no crime, no nothing.

1:19:40.916 --> 1:19:42.333
So yeah, it's pretty bad.

1:19:42.833 --> 1:19:44.375
So I'll never be cleared?

1:19:44.458 --> 1:19:46.875
Your dad will go down for it,
and so will we.

1:19:46.958 --> 1:19:49.666
Right. I, uh, regret to inform you

1:19:49.750 --> 1:19:53.375
that my career in politics
has just ended, actually.

1:19:54.541 --> 1:19:57.083
That's a real big shame, Alexandre.

1:19:58.250 --> 1:19:59.416
Thank you, Momo.

1:20:00.708 --> 1:20:02.000
[inhales sharply]

1:20:02.083 --> 1:20:04.500
You got something else? A plan B?

1:20:05.166 --> 1:20:06.541
I made no plan B.

1:20:06.625 --> 1:20:09.291
He comes to save me,
and I'm still not his priority.

1:20:09.375 --> 1:20:10.833
[Richard] I did come to save you.

1:20:11.500 --> 1:20:13.875
And then I put
national security before that.

1:20:13.958 --> 1:20:15.000
You were right to.

1:20:15.875 --> 1:20:17.458
As an agent, yes.

1:20:17.541 --> 1:20:18.458
As a parent,

1:20:19.291 --> 1:20:20.125
no.

1:20:20.208 --> 1:20:23.083
You're right. As an agent, you're great.
You did what you're supposed to.

1:20:23.166 --> 1:20:24.458
Yeah…

1:20:24.541 --> 1:20:26.000
Except as a dad…

1:20:28.708 --> 1:20:29.583
Yeah, I agree.

1:20:30.166 --> 1:20:31.208
Thanks, man.

1:20:33.541 --> 1:20:36.041
Archibald, maybe the same goes for me.

1:20:36.125 --> 1:20:40.458
You are a grown man.
I want a responsible son!

1:20:40.541 --> 1:20:44.416
Not a spoiled brat like you are,
who can't drive!

1:20:45.291 --> 1:20:48.166
Who screams and runs away from a fight!

1:20:51.583 --> 1:20:54.083
Who just hides behind being a student.

1:20:54.166 --> 1:20:55.375
[breath trembling]

1:20:55.875 --> 1:20:57.416
[breathing heavily]

1:20:58.458 --> 1:21:01.000
Look at me, son. Archibald.

1:21:01.916 --> 1:21:04.875
Life is similar to an operation.

1:21:04.958 --> 1:21:07.583
This life, the one we live every day.

1:21:08.708 --> 1:21:11.916
You do your best with what you've got.

1:21:14.333 --> 1:21:16.708
And you, Archibald,

1:21:17.291 --> 1:21:19.625
you are my greatest scar.

1:21:23.833 --> 1:21:26.541
[noble music playing]

1:21:26.625 --> 1:21:28.708
I guess we do have one thing in common.

1:21:30.541 --> 1:21:31.791
We feel let down.

1:21:37.333 --> 1:21:38.958
Uh, I don't want to bring it up,

1:21:39.041 --> 1:21:42.666
but I don't know how you could have,
uh, mistaken a passport for a phone.

1:21:42.750 --> 1:21:44.291
-Leave it.
-[Momo] They're nothing alike.

1:21:44.375 --> 1:21:47.083
You can't flip through the pages
of a phone. They feel nothing alike.

1:21:47.166 --> 1:21:50.625
If the sale does move
through the embassy tonight…

1:21:51.708 --> 1:21:54.916
Uh, yes, you've clearly missed
one small detail, Richard.

1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:56.958
But Simyon's on a plane right now.

1:21:58.166 --> 1:21:59.166
That's perfect.

1:22:01.500 --> 1:22:02.750
What's he mean?

1:22:02.833 --> 1:22:06.166
-Yeah, Simyon, you good? Where you at?
-[Simyon] What do you think, coño?

1:22:06.250 --> 1:22:07.875
-I'm still at the embassy, dick face.
-Yes!

1:22:07.958 --> 1:22:10.041
[in Simyon's voice]
We'll carry on as planned tonight.

1:22:10.125 --> 1:22:11.375
You'd better remember mi regalo.

1:22:11.458 --> 1:22:12.708
[Paul] As for you, don't forget

1:22:12.791 --> 1:22:15.666
my 30 million de fajitas,
por favor, señorita!

1:22:15.750 --> 1:22:17.000
You making a joke?

1:22:17.083 --> 1:22:19.541
Making a joke, no, but you are
saying things to me in Spanish.

1:22:19.625 --> 1:22:22.250
Be there at 9:00 p.m., my room, coño.

1:22:22.333 --> 1:22:23.166
[Paul] Hello?

1:22:23.250 --> 1:22:24.500
Ooh. [chuckles]

1:22:24.583 --> 1:22:26.000
Ah, he's good.

1:22:26.083 --> 1:22:28.583
[normal voice] Given the security detail,
we won't be armed.

1:22:28.666 --> 1:22:30.666
Ah, I sense a huge operation ahead.

1:22:30.750 --> 1:22:33.333
Uh, no, it's my operation.
I won't involve anyone else.

1:22:33.416 --> 1:22:34.708
Especially not him.

1:22:34.791 --> 1:22:36.416
What? No, no, no, no!

1:22:36.500 --> 1:22:39.625
I'm linked to this.
You got that? It's nonnegotiable.

1:22:39.708 --> 1:22:40.708
I'm coming.

1:22:42.250 --> 1:22:46.083
Skip the grand finale?
Buddy, forget it. I'm with Archie.

1:22:46.166 --> 1:22:48.791
Yeah, yeah, I'm not leaving Archie's side.
I'm not leaving my sister.

1:22:48.875 --> 1:22:50.791
So what's the deal? Can I get a gun?

1:22:51.541 --> 1:22:52.916
Nobody asked, but I'm in.

1:22:53.000 --> 1:22:57.000
For my dad, for Grandpa Jacques,
and because I'm not gonna be made a fool.

1:22:57.583 --> 1:22:58.541
[sighs]

1:22:58.625 --> 1:23:01.375
There's just one small detail.
No cash, then no sale.

1:23:02.125 --> 1:23:04.583
It's just that 30 million
isn't a small detail.

1:23:04.666 --> 1:23:05.958
It's a big detail.

1:23:07.208 --> 1:23:08.666
Depends who it is.

1:23:08.750 --> 1:23:11.500
[dramatic music playing]

1:23:18.708 --> 1:23:22.875
[in Russian over tablet] Listen, the Mist,
30 million is a big sum.

1:23:24.125 --> 1:23:26.083
But you saved my son, so--

1:23:26.166 --> 1:23:28.583
Look, the Mist! My bruise is almost gone!

1:23:29.791 --> 1:23:32.250
[continues in Russian indistinctly]

1:23:32.333 --> 1:23:33.541
What are we looking?

1:23:34.083 --> 1:23:35.000
Shh.

1:23:36.791 --> 1:23:39.791
[in Russian] The deal is
the money is yours for 24 hours.

1:23:41.125 --> 1:23:43.250
-Okay?
-[Richard in Russian] Not one more.

1:23:45.291 --> 1:23:46.875
[in English] We'll have it in an hour.

1:23:47.375 --> 1:23:50.375
Thirty million in an hour?
What app are you on?

1:23:50.875 --> 1:23:53.833
TAARGHISTAN EMBASSY

1:24:04.541 --> 1:24:06.500
Okay, the ballerina makes her entrance.

1:24:06.583 --> 1:24:08.166
Up, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup.

1:24:10.708 --> 1:24:12.541
Ah, Eagle One.

1:24:16.625 --> 1:24:18.000
Falcon Two.

1:24:20.750 --> 1:24:23.791
Now… Fox… Oh, hey, buddy.

1:24:24.416 --> 1:24:27.000
-[earphone beeps]
-Snake is on the move.

1:24:29.833 --> 1:24:30.833
Hands off.

1:24:33.375 --> 1:24:34.208
Spider…

1:24:36.833 --> 1:24:38.791
Dalila, why am I always just the watch?

1:24:38.875 --> 1:24:40.291
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

1:24:40.375 --> 1:24:43.291
-I'd like a sparkling water.
-Yeah, and I'd like a Mercedes, actually.

1:24:43.375 --> 1:24:45.333
So there. We all suffer.

1:25:18.375 --> 1:25:19.458
That's my boy.

1:25:20.708 --> 1:25:22.833
[video game sound effects playing]

1:25:22.916 --> 1:25:24.125
[Archibald] Whoa!

1:25:24.208 --> 1:25:26.291
The guy has his own private game room!

1:25:27.750 --> 1:25:28.583
Oh!

1:25:29.125 --> 1:25:30.708
Oh, there's a train track on the ceiling!

1:25:30.791 --> 1:25:32.416
[Dalila] Archie, stop touching everything.

1:25:33.208 --> 1:25:35.000
Okay. There are tons of cameras.

1:25:35.083 --> 1:25:37.916
We can film the complete transaction
and catch them in the act.

1:25:38.000 --> 1:25:40.750
But they're gonna wanna see the money
before they do the exchange.

1:25:40.833 --> 1:25:42.000
[briefcase clicks open]

1:25:43.083 --> 1:25:45.250
-[gasps]
-[Archibald] Oh!

1:25:49.416 --> 1:25:51.208
-Shall we get changed?
-[Archibald] Uh, okay.

1:25:51.291 --> 1:25:52.541
Let's do it.

1:25:53.375 --> 1:25:55.500
-Commander?
-[Jouard] Yes?

1:25:55.583 --> 1:25:57.500
Richard Brumère on the phone for you.

1:26:07.625 --> 1:26:09.291
[watch beeps, ticking]

1:26:09.375 --> 1:26:10.583
[phone line clicks]

1:26:10.666 --> 1:26:12.541
-Richard?
-[Richard on phone] Guy, my friend.

1:26:12.625 --> 1:26:15.000
-How are you?
-Oh, you know I'm not your friend.

1:26:15.083 --> 1:26:18.416
For old times' sake,
I'll save you some trouble, Brumère.

1:26:18.500 --> 1:26:21.250
Hugo's standing here with me.
He wants to say hello.

1:26:22.708 --> 1:26:23.916
[Richard] Constantin?

1:26:24.625 --> 1:26:26.125
How is it going, Richard?

1:26:27.916 --> 1:26:29.833
Let's all get together, Richard.

1:26:29.916 --> 1:26:31.708
For old times' sake,
just the three of us.

1:26:31.791 --> 1:26:33.666
[Richard] Fieldwork's not your thing.

1:26:33.750 --> 1:26:36.166
As your wife said,
it's difficult to perform well

1:26:36.250 --> 1:26:38.208
when you don't have the right tools.

1:26:38.291 --> 1:26:40.583
-Now listen to me, you coward!
-[line beeping]

1:26:41.208 --> 1:26:42.375
He hung up already.

1:26:42.458 --> 1:26:43.666
[beeps]

1:26:43.750 --> 1:26:45.708
Thirty-eight seconds! Asshole.

1:26:45.791 --> 1:26:49.916
That's all we need these days though, huh?
Right? Huh? So who's the micro-dick now?

1:26:50.000 --> 1:26:52.583
[in singsong] Who, who, who
is taking it up the ass?

1:26:52.666 --> 1:26:54.916
Who, who, who is taking it up the ass?

1:26:55.000 --> 1:26:56.083
[spluttering]

1:26:56.166 --> 1:26:57.500
What game are you playing?

1:26:57.583 --> 1:27:01.458
Apologies, Mr… Madam Minister.
The pressure has been getting to me.

1:27:01.541 --> 1:27:04.333
-Where are they at?
-[Jouard] Good question.

1:27:04.416 --> 1:27:06.083
Boris, where are they?

1:27:06.666 --> 1:27:08.291
[loudly] Boris, where are they?

1:27:09.208 --> 1:27:10.208
Archibald.

1:27:11.500 --> 1:27:12.500
