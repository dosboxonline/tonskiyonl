01:20.166 --> 01:22.625
You will never have it, Gaston!

01:22.708 --> 01:25.458
The trident is sacred to my kingdom!

01:25.541 --> 01:27.291
Can it, tuna!

01:27.375 --> 01:29.875
Your kingdom will not be yours
much longer.

01:29.958 --> 01:32.708
Magic Mirror,
show this overgrown carnival prize

01:32.791 --> 01:34.708
all the castles in my control.

01:37.333 --> 01:39.666
Magic Mirror, show him.

01:40.708 --> 01:41.916
[sighs]

01:42.500 --> 01:43.750
Please.

01:44.250 --> 01:48.083
[fire roars]

01:50.083 --> 01:52.083
Gaston,

01:52.166 --> 01:54.958
many castles you control,

01:55.041 --> 01:57.208
many relics you possess.

01:57.833 --> 01:59.916
Ooh, this is my favorite part.

02:00.000 --> 02:03.333
[Magic Mirror]
You may take over all the lands

02:03.416 --> 02:06.333
if no one puts you to the test.

02:06.416 --> 02:08.083
Who would dare challenge me?

02:08.166 --> 02:09.666
I'm unstoppable!

02:09.750 --> 02:11.708
Why are you doing this?

02:11.791 --> 02:14.125
I'm the greatest hunter in the land.

02:14.208 --> 02:18.666
There's no beast I can't vanquish,
no prey I can't slay.

02:18.750 --> 02:21.291
So now, I hunt the most elusive game,

02:21.375 --> 02:24.125
items steeped in magical power.

02:24.208 --> 02:27.208
The more I collect,
the more powerful I become!

♪ Look at this stuff
Isn't it neat? ♪

02:30.583 --> 02:31.583
[sighs]

02:31.666 --> 02:33.125
I have so many trophies,

02:33.208 --> 02:35.416
I took over
this inexplicably abandoned castle

02:35.500 --> 02:36.500
just to store them.

02:36.583 --> 02:40.750
And I have a very special room
reserved for you, friend.

02:41.333 --> 02:43.125
Just as soon as someone…

02:45.166 --> 02:46.666
releases his hold on you.

02:50.583 --> 02:51.583
[screams]

02:53.375 --> 02:55.166
[clears throat] I meant to do that.

02:55.250 --> 02:56.458
[grunts, growls]

02:57.125 --> 03:03.541
Oh, I'll release the trident to you,
if you give me a chance to win my freedom.

03:03.625 --> 03:05.708
Are you suggesting a contest?

03:05.791 --> 03:09.541
If I win and you are defeated
by my bravest warriors,

03:09.625 --> 03:13.208
I take my trident,
and you return what you've stolen.

03:13.708 --> 03:17.041
But if you win,
not only will you get my trident,

03:17.125 --> 03:20.625
but you'll gain control
of all the oceans as well.

03:21.125 --> 03:22.875
Even the little one?

03:23.375 --> 03:25.416
Oh, especially the little one.

03:25.500 --> 03:27.625
Then let's see who I'll be up against.

03:27.708 --> 03:31.750
Magic Mirror on the wall,
bring me the bravest warriors of them all.

03:31.833 --> 03:38.291
I know five warriors you might face,
when united, will put you in your place.

03:38.375 --> 03:42.500
Five warriors true, when brought together,

03:42.583 --> 03:46.000
could be even more than you could weather.

03:46.083 --> 03:49.166
You're a charmed piece of glass.
What do you know about weather?

Protector of creatures great and small,

04:02.833 --> 04:04.791

The bravest wayfinder of them all,

04:09.041 --> 04:10.333

04:10.833 --> 04:14.958
Steadfast, determined, logical and bold,

04:15.041 --> 04:16.375

04:17.375 --> 04:21.958
Not one to sit back and do as she's told,

04:22.041 --> 04:24.208
Rapunzel.

04:24.291 --> 04:27.500
A final warrior will take pains

04:27.583 --> 04:32.000
to free her father from your chains.

04:32.500 --> 04:33.666
Ariel.

04:33.750 --> 04:36.666
Ooh, I think my horse took a wrong turn.

04:36.750 --> 04:39.583
I don't think animals had
anything to do with this.

04:39.666 --> 04:42.750
Daddy! Oh, no. What is happening?

04:42.833 --> 04:45.333
Gramma Tala always said
the ocean was home to many,

04:45.416 --> 04:47.750
but I've never met anyone like you.

04:48.583 --> 04:50.083
And never like this.

04:50.166 --> 04:51.416
Who did this to you?

04:51.500 --> 04:52.875
Oh, Ariel.

04:52.958 --> 04:55.666
Ladies, please. One at a time.

04:56.333 --> 04:58.666
Startled? I have that effect on women.

04:58.750 --> 05:00.500
The name's Gaston.

05:00.583 --> 05:03.041
You can't trap my father like this.

05:03.125 --> 05:04.916
Release him at once.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.541
Not until he gives me what I want.

05:07.625 --> 05:09.666
His giant fork.

05:10.583 --> 05:13.750
With all the other magical objects
he's stolen,

05:13.833 --> 05:18.458
if he takes my trident,
his power will be unstoppable.

05:18.541 --> 05:22.166
He will rule over
all the lands and oceans.

05:23.041 --> 05:25.000
That's why you've been brought here.

05:25.083 --> 05:28.125
So you're the reason
the clouds are so dark in my kingdom.

05:28.208 --> 05:30.583
And why I can't navigate using the stars.

05:30.666 --> 05:33.000
[chuckles] Guilty as charged.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.250
Bring back the sun, you monster.

05:35.333 --> 05:36.458
-Easy there.
-[grunting]

05:36.541 --> 05:38.458
You'll want to save your energy.

05:38.541 --> 05:40.791
First, a little contest.

05:40.875 --> 05:42.958
You have three challenges to complete.

05:43.041 --> 05:45.583
If you succeed, I'll release him.

05:45.666 --> 05:47.791
-But if you fail--
-I won't fail.

05:47.875 --> 05:51.083
I'm ready to face
whatever challenges you've set up.

05:51.166 --> 05:52.500
We're all ready.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.041
No. You can't join me.

05:55.125 --> 05:56.375
It's too dangerous.

05:56.458 --> 05:58.083
Gaston must be stopped.

05:58.166 --> 06:02.000
If the ocean or its king needs me,
I'm there. Count me in.

06:02.083 --> 06:05.208
Ariel, not a day goes by
where I don't miss my daddy

06:05.291 --> 06:06.875
with every bit of my heart.

06:06.958 --> 06:09.833
If I can help you avoid that pain, I will.

06:09.916 --> 06:11.833
And I have an axe!

06:12.875 --> 06:15.000
What do we have to do? We're ready.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.458
Magic Mirror, if you please.

06:17.541 --> 06:19.000
Magic Mirror?

06:20.291 --> 06:22.333
Well, well, well.

06:22.416 --> 06:23.916
We meet again.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.083
Oh. [chuckles]

06:25.166 --> 06:27.791
Hey, Snow White.

06:27.875 --> 06:33.041
I'm so sorry about the Evil Queen,
the Huntsman, etcetera.

06:33.125 --> 06:34.583
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

06:34.666 --> 06:36.416
Water under the bridge.

06:36.958 --> 06:38.083

06:39.875 --> 06:42.291
-[giggles]
-[clears throat]

06:42.375 --> 06:48.250
Behind three doors in this castle
lie three challenges.

06:48.333 --> 06:52.333
Bravery and resourcefulness
will be your guides.

06:52.416 --> 06:57.625
The path will be clear
if you search inside.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.333
Let the games begin.

07:03.333 --> 07:04.333
[Ariel] No!

07:04.416 --> 07:07.208
He can't be out of the water
for very long. He'll die!

07:07.291 --> 07:09.291
Then I would get moving if I were you.

07:09.375 --> 07:10.666
Time is ticking.

07:10.750 --> 07:12.916
Or dripping, in this case.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.500
[chuckles] Oh, Gaston, you cad.

07:16.083 --> 07:19.500
I almost lost you once.
I won't lose you again.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.041
Okay, ladies.

07:21.125 --> 07:23.333
Let's storm this castle.

07:23.416 --> 07:25.416
[all panting]

07:32.291 --> 07:33.833
There are so many doors.

07:34.541 --> 07:36.291
Which one do we choose?

07:36.958 --> 07:41.541
Magic Mirror said the path will be clear
if you search inside.

07:42.041 --> 07:43.416
Inside.

07:43.500 --> 07:44.666
I-Inside?

07:48.125 --> 07:49.041
Ah!

07:49.125 --> 07:50.375
What? [chuckles]

07:50.458 --> 07:52.833
You store things in your hair?

07:52.916 --> 07:55.166
I always have a scootieblot on me.

07:55.250 --> 07:57.916
I never know
when I'll need to dig a small hole or--

07:58.000 --> 07:59.291
Or scratch my back.

07:59.375 --> 08:01.166
-[giggles]
-Ariel, that's a key.

08:01.250 --> 08:03.166
You use it to unlock doors.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.500
Maybe it's a clue.

08:09.958 --> 08:11.958
-There.
-[all panting]

08:14.958 --> 08:16.041
We should split up.

08:16.125 --> 08:17.208
We'll try this door.

08:17.291 --> 08:18.666
[Snow White gasps] Oh, dear.

08:18.750 --> 08:22.166
I don't think I'm going to like
where this door goes.

08:26.250 --> 08:28.250
It worked. What about that door?

08:28.333 --> 08:29.416
[doorknob rattles]

08:29.500 --> 08:31.625
[sighs] No good. It's locked.

08:31.708 --> 08:33.541
Let me try mine!

08:33.625 --> 08:35.000
[pan clangs]

08:36.000 --> 08:38.750
And here I am using frying pans
for cooking.

08:38.833 --> 08:40.375
Why don't you go first?

08:42.458 --> 08:45.375
[grunts] I'm ready for you, deadly--

08:45.458 --> 08:47.416
Bedroom? With calming mood lighting?

08:47.500 --> 08:49.041
Ooh.

08:53.791 --> 08:54.791
[gasps]

08:55.333 --> 08:57.333
And a fruit basket.

08:58.625 --> 09:00.791
-[inhales deeply, gasps]
-Don't eat that!

09:02.708 --> 09:07.375
[chuckles] This room is beautiful,
but I don't see a challenge.

09:07.458 --> 09:12.125
Maybe the challenge lies
not in what is here but what's not here.

09:12.708 --> 09:13.750
Hmm.

09:13.833 --> 09:17.208
Something must be missing,
but I can't put my finger on it.

09:17.291 --> 09:19.208
[foot tapping]

09:19.291 --> 09:21.208
Hmm. What about your foot?

09:23.250 --> 09:25.291
Ariel, that must be it.

09:25.375 --> 09:27.750
-A mat used to be here.
-[gasps] Or a carpet.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.666
[occupant] Oh, thank goodness.

09:29.750 --> 09:32.041
[chuckles]
I thought you'd never figure it out.

09:33.291 --> 09:34.583
Is that the challenge?

09:34.666 --> 09:36.166
It sure is!

09:36.250 --> 09:39.208
And you must find the Magic Carpet.

09:39.291 --> 09:42.000
But, ah, where is it?

09:42.875 --> 09:46.791
"The path will be clear
if you search inside."

09:46.875 --> 09:50.958
Ah! Uh, pardon me, but may we look inside?

09:51.041 --> 09:52.166
Of course!

09:52.250 --> 09:55.333
I'm filled to the gills with good stuff.

09:55.416 --> 10:00.291
And there's something extra special
for you, Moana.

10:00.375 --> 10:01.375
[giggles]

10:04.916 --> 10:05.916
[Moana] Gramma Tala?

10:18.125 --> 10:20.583
That's a sign if I've ever seen one.
Let's go.

10:21.916 --> 10:24.416
[giggling] Oh, that tickles.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.416
[gasps] Hey, watch the drawers.

10:39.250 --> 10:41.166
[objects rattling]

10:41.250 --> 10:43.291
Gotta find it. Gotta find it.

10:44.458 --> 10:45.458
[contents rattle]

10:45.541 --> 10:47.083
What are we looking for again?

10:47.166 --> 10:49.375
We're just looking-- [gasps]

10:49.958 --> 10:51.833
What is happening to your hair?

10:51.916 --> 10:53.208
It's incredible.

10:53.291 --> 10:54.666
Oh, this? [chuckles]

10:54.750 --> 10:57.375
This sometimes happens
because of the Sundrop Flower.

10:57.458 --> 10:58.458
I wonder if--

10:58.541 --> 11:01.041
Finding the Sundrop Flower
is our challenge?

11:01.125 --> 11:02.375
I bet it is.

11:02.458 --> 11:04.833
I'm not familiar with that species.

11:04.916 --> 11:06.708
Do they often grow in bedrooms?

11:06.791 --> 11:09.541
-Not typically.
-[Tiana] Huh.

11:10.791 --> 11:13.333
Strange. These are all cookbooks.

11:13.833 --> 11:16.916
Ah. I don't believe it.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.541
This is my daddy's cookbook.

11:19.041 --> 11:20.125
W-Why is it here?

11:20.208 --> 11:24.208
Sometimes we don't know
how things find us. They just do.

11:24.291 --> 11:26.250
I think you should look inside.

11:27.666 --> 11:28.916
-[Tiana] Huh?
-[all gasp]

11:29.000 --> 11:30.375
-[Rapunzel] Ooh.
-[Tiana gasps]

11:30.458 --> 11:31.458
[Snow White] Huh?

11:32.541 --> 11:34.083
Should we knock first?

11:34.166 --> 11:35.666
I hate to be rude.

11:41.083 --> 11:42.125
[door creaks]

11:42.208 --> 11:44.458
[all scream]

-[waves lapping]

11:50.875 --> 11:51.958
[both scream, grunt]

11:55.916 --> 11:57.166
Where are we?

11:57.250 --> 11:58.375
[Moana] Strange.

11:58.458 --> 12:00.083
I don't know this island.

12:01.416 --> 12:02.583
[Ariel] Ooh.

12:02.666 --> 12:04.333
Let's follow the feet holes.

12:15.375 --> 12:17.583
Oh. There's that shell again.

12:17.666 --> 12:21.208
Okay. What's this tree hiding?

12:25.416 --> 12:27.625
[grunting]

12:30.500 --> 12:32.666
Oh, it's hiding absolutely nothing.

12:33.333 --> 12:36.000
This calls for a scootieblot moment.

12:38.333 --> 12:42.541
-I have really got to get me one of those.
-[Ariel grunts]

12:42.625 --> 12:44.666
-[thuds]
-[gasps] There's something here.

12:53.791 --> 12:55.750
[gasps] Ariel, it's a treasure map.

12:56.625 --> 12:59.041
My navigation skills
can definitely get us there.

12:59.125 --> 13:00.625
Great. Let's go.

13:07.041 --> 13:10.500
Hold on. I don't have a tail.

13:10.583 --> 13:11.625
Oh. Right.

13:11.708 --> 13:12.958
[chuckles] Of course.

13:16.625 --> 13:17.625
[grunts]

13:19.291 --> 13:20.416
[object whistling]

13:21.291 --> 13:22.875
But I can build a canoe.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.583
[all scream, grunt]

13:41.416 --> 13:43.500
-Do either of you know where we are?
-[screams, shrieks]

13:43.583 --> 13:46.500
This place is spookier than the bayou
on a new moon night.

13:46.583 --> 13:48.250
-[Snow White panting]
-I don't know this place.

13:48.333 --> 13:51.291
But, admittedly,
I haven't spent much time outside.

13:51.375 --> 13:52.583
-[clacking]
-Snow White?

13:52.666 --> 13:53.666
[both gasp]

13:55.041 --> 13:56.625
[armor beeping]

13:57.708 --> 13:59.333
You should both suit up.

13:59.416 --> 14:00.750
This is the Dark Forest.

14:00.833 --> 14:02.791
It does not mess around.

14:02.875 --> 14:03.875
[screams, grunts]

14:05.125 --> 14:06.416
No!

14:06.500 --> 14:08.875
My indestructible armor!

14:08.958 --> 14:11.125
So, this is the Dark Forest?

14:11.208 --> 14:12.833
It must be a pretty scary place.

14:12.916 --> 14:15.166
There are so many dangers.

14:15.250 --> 14:17.375
I don't know how we'll make it through.

14:17.458 --> 14:18.875
We have each other.

14:18.958 --> 14:21.208
And our friend Ariel needs us now.

14:21.291 --> 14:23.166
We'll make it through together.

14:23.250 --> 14:25.833
I'm so grateful to have you with me.

14:25.916 --> 14:27.583
Maybe it won't be so bad.

14:27.666 --> 14:30.125
After all, I've been here before.

14:30.208 --> 14:31.583
I know what to expect.

14:31.666 --> 14:32.750
Exactly.

14:32.833 --> 14:36.375
The bears are really quite friendly
once they've been fed.

14:36.458 --> 14:37.458
Bears?

14:37.541 --> 14:38.791
Did she say bears?

14:38.875 --> 14:41.875
And the man-eating spiders
don't actually eat you.

14:41.958 --> 14:44.000
They just nibble on your limbs a bit.

14:44.083 --> 14:45.375
It kinda tickles.

14:45.458 --> 14:47.708
Uh, man-eating spiders?

14:47.791 --> 14:50.416
Oh, I feel much better.

14:50.500 --> 14:53.125
Thank you for reminding me
what's important.

14:53.208 --> 14:56.333
That girl is seven gems short
of a diamond mine.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.750
Oh, this is just insulting.

15:03.833 --> 15:05.666
[Gaston] But you chose five ladyfolk.

15:05.750 --> 15:08.750
Surely I'm stronger and braver than them.

15:08.833 --> 15:11.041
I have cheekbones like marble,

15:11.125 --> 15:13.250
teeth like cinder blocks,

15:13.333 --> 15:15.541
abs you could wash laundry on.

15:15.625 --> 15:18.666
If I did laundry, I totally would.

15:18.750 --> 15:20.250
[flies buzzing]

15:20.333 --> 15:22.750
Alas, Gaston.

15:22.833 --> 15:24.250
Oh, what do you know?

15:24.333 --> 15:26.625
You may think
they're suitable matches for me,

15:26.708 --> 15:30.041
but we'll see
if they even survive the third challenge.

15:30.125 --> 15:33.291
What do you mean
survive the third challenge?

15:33.375 --> 15:36.375
The first two challenges are tests
of cunning and bravery.

15:36.458 --> 15:38.041
Yes, yes. Go on.

15:38.125 --> 15:41.541
And the third challenge is,
there is no challenge.

15:41.625 --> 15:43.375
It's a death trap.

15:43.458 --> 15:45.916
-What?
-[chuckling] Classic Gaston.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.625
Then I win because they forfeit.

15:47.708 --> 15:50.250
They didn't forfeit. They were tricked.

15:50.333 --> 15:54.375
I get your big fork,
and I become ruler of land and oceans,

15:54.458 --> 15:57.958
with Magic Mirror here
as my loyal assistant.

15:58.041 --> 16:01.416
I serve no one but myself.

16:01.500 --> 16:05.000
-We'll talk.
-This-- This was all a setup?

16:05.083 --> 16:07.208
Don't be so hard on yourself.

16:07.291 --> 16:08.666
You're all scales and tails.

16:08.750 --> 16:12.666
You couldn't have known
that I'm as calculating as I am handsome.

16:13.166 --> 16:15.666
-[shrieks]
-You're a scoundrel.

16:15.750 --> 16:17.375
And you'll never win.

16:17.458 --> 16:20.083
Ariel is far more clever than you.

16:20.166 --> 16:21.333
They all are!

16:21.416 --> 16:25.208
-You think they might foil my plan?
-I know they will.

16:25.291 --> 16:28.833
[scoffs] Then maybe we should
complicate things a little.

16:28.916 --> 16:31.916
[cackles]

16:36.791 --> 16:38.750
[gasps, groans]

16:39.625 --> 16:41.000
[groans]

16:46.208 --> 16:48.916
Hold on, Moana! [screaming]

16:49.708 --> 16:52.000
[Gaston scatting]

16:53.500 --> 16:54.500
[spell zaps]

16:54.583 --> 16:55.708
A dash of thunder.

16:56.208 --> 16:57.333
A pinch of lightning.

16:58.083 --> 17:02.291
And a heaping helping
of torrential downpour!

17:07.500 --> 17:10.208
[thunder rumbling]

17:11.875 --> 17:13.208
[Moana panting]

17:13.708 --> 17:15.083
Let's call for backup.

17:15.708 --> 17:17.666
Friends, help!

17:17.750 --> 17:19.125
Ocean, help!

17:24.083 --> 17:25.375
[dolphin whistles]

17:26.791 --> 17:28.541
[clicks, squeaks]

17:28.625 --> 17:31.000
Hello, friend. You're right on time.

17:34.166 --> 17:36.166
[cheers]

17:41.125 --> 17:43.458
[bird squawking]

17:43.541 --> 17:45.750
What can you tell us
about the Sundrop Flower?

17:45.833 --> 17:49.458
It grows in the most enchanted,
magical part of a forest,

17:49.541 --> 17:51.291
and it has healing powers.

17:51.375 --> 17:52.958
My mother drank its nectar,

17:53.041 --> 17:55.416
and that's why
my hair glows the way it does.

17:55.500 --> 17:57.708
Ohhh! There it goes again.

17:57.791 --> 17:59.291
It must be close.

17:59.375 --> 18:00.708
-[leaves rustling]
-[gasps]

18:01.750 --> 18:03.666
-[gasps]
-What's that sound?

18:04.250 --> 18:06.083
Maybe it's the flower?

18:07.666 --> 18:09.375
This is the Dark Forest.

18:10.541 --> 18:12.583
It could be anything. Or nothing.

18:14.625 --> 18:16.125
That's how it gets you.

18:16.208 --> 18:17.666
The fear.

18:26.833 --> 18:27.916
-[twig snaps]
-[all scream]

18:29.041 --> 18:30.375
Hello.

18:30.458 --> 18:32.791
You found the flower.

18:32.875 --> 18:35.291
[sighs] I'm sorry, little friend.

18:35.375 --> 18:38.208
But you aren't quite
the flower we're looking for.

18:38.291 --> 18:41.291
-[chuckles]
-But we are very glad to meet you.

18:41.375 --> 18:42.833
Maybe you can help us.

18:42.916 --> 18:45.041
I would love to help you.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.958
[chuckling] I don't mind.

18:47.041 --> 18:49.916
Do you know where the Sundrop Flower is?

18:50.000 --> 18:52.083
Mm-hmm. [laughing]

18:52.166 --> 18:54.166
Come on. Let's follow him.

18:54.250 --> 18:55.458
But not too close.

18:55.541 --> 18:57.125
[laughing]

19:02.750 --> 19:03.583
-[Moana grunts]
-Oh.

19:03.666 --> 19:05.625
-[dolphin clicks, squeaks]
-Thanks for the lift, friend.

19:05.708 --> 19:07.583
And the smooth surfing, ocean.

19:08.375 --> 19:09.375
[giggles]

19:16.833 --> 19:18.833
[both laugh]

19:19.875 --> 19:20.875
This way.

19:24.000 --> 19:25.000
[gasps, grunts]

19:25.083 --> 19:26.000
-Huh.
-[gasps]

19:26.083 --> 19:28.083
[pirates shouting]

19:32.333 --> 19:33.333
[both gasp]

19:34.541 --> 19:36.041
You heard the orders.

19:36.125 --> 19:39.833
As soon as all the treasure is cleared
outta the cave, we sail.

19:39.916 --> 19:42.166
Aye, aye. I'll tell the others to hurry.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.125
Let's get to the cave.

19:45.208 --> 19:48.000
If treasure is in there,
maybe the carpet is too.

19:48.083 --> 19:50.958
Or wait for the carpet to come to us.

19:52.208 --> 19:54.833
[gasps]
Do you think that's the Magic Carpet?

19:54.916 --> 19:56.791
Only one way to find out.

19:57.375 --> 19:59.083
Psst. Psst.

20:01.833 --> 20:02.833
[gasps]

20:08.125 --> 20:10.791
[growling]

20:10.875 --> 20:12.250
Um.

20:12.333 --> 20:13.625
Are you hungry?

20:13.708 --> 20:16.708
-I can whip up a bit of forest gumbo.
-That wasn't me.

20:16.791 --> 20:19.166
If I had to guess,
I'd say there are three…

20:19.250 --> 20:23.166
-[wolf howls]
-…make that four, wolves.

20:23.250 --> 20:25.000
Hungry wolves, by the sound of it.

20:25.083 --> 20:27.208
-[wolf barks, growls]
-Uh, do they like gumbo?

20:27.291 --> 20:29.166
-Run!
-[growling continues]

20:31.083 --> 20:33.083
[snarling, barking]

20:36.041 --> 20:38.041
[pirates shouting]

20:45.166 --> 20:47.458
[pirate grumbles]

20:47.958 --> 20:50.500
Speed up, mates. Captain's coming.

20:50.583 --> 20:51.875
[pirates] Aye, aye.

20:51.958 --> 20:52.958
[sighs]

20:56.000 --> 20:59.625
I bet they put Magic Carpet in the galley
with the other treasure.

20:59.708 --> 21:00.916
We need a plan.

21:01.000 --> 21:02.166
Hmm.

21:02.250 --> 21:04.541
Ooh. A tuba-boom.

21:06.166 --> 21:07.333
What's a tuba-boom?

21:07.416 --> 21:10.958
A musical instrument ships play
when they pass each other in the night.

21:11.041 --> 21:12.958
[chuckles] It's very romantic.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.500
Come on.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.416
[pirates gasp, grunt]

21:23.250 --> 21:24.416
[pirate 1] Get the cannon!

21:24.500 --> 21:26.666
-[pirate 2] No, no.
-[pirate 1] It's getting away.

21:27.291 --> 21:29.666
[pirate 1] Grab it!
Someone grab it! [yelps]

21:29.750 --> 21:32.833
-[pirate 2] The cannon! [shrieks]
-[pirate 1] Run away from the cannon!

21:32.916 --> 21:34.083
[cannon crashes]

21:35.041 --> 21:36.916
-[groans]
-[growls]

21:37.000 --> 21:39.583
Keep your hands to yourself!

21:39.666 --> 21:42.250
[grunts, groans]

21:42.333 --> 21:43.416
[pirate] Argh!

21:43.500 --> 21:46.958
[pirates growling]

21:47.041 --> 21:48.041
You've got this.

21:48.125 --> 21:50.375
Just think of them as giant Kakamora…

21:50.458 --> 21:53.166
[growling continues]

21:53.250 --> 21:54.375
…who growl.

21:55.625 --> 21:58.000
-[wolves growl]

23:35.166 --> 23:37.333
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
How about this one?

23:37.416 --> 23:40.666
-How does Captain Hook pick his nose?
-[laughs]

23:40.750 --> 23:42.500
-How? [laughing]
-Carefully!

23:42.583 --> 23:44.458
-[laughs]
-[laughs] Huh?

23:48.875 --> 23:50.875
[grunts, sneezes]

23:50.958 --> 23:53.000
-[Ariel] Gesundheit.
-Aw, thanks!

24:37.833 --> 24:39.625
No, thank you!

24:39.708 --> 24:40.708
[chuckles]

24:40.791 --> 24:41.791
Wait a second.

24:42.583 --> 24:44.000
[wolves growling]

24:44.083 --> 24:45.208
Well… [sighs]

24:45.291 --> 24:48.333
…I would just like to say
that I've enjoyed our time together.

24:48.416 --> 24:49.875
You've got to have hope.

24:49.958 --> 24:52.333
-There's still a way out of this.
-Indeed!

24:52.833 --> 24:54.958
I'm going to have
a conversation with them.

24:55.041 --> 24:56.458
A conversation?

24:56.541 --> 25:01.041
-Unless you speak wolf, I don't think--
-[barks, growls]

25:01.125 --> 25:03.958
Oh. She really does speak wolf.

26:23.875 --> 26:25.500
Ohhh!

26:25.583 --> 26:28.416
Now she's leading a puppy cuddle party.

Come on.

26:33.250 --> 26:34.375

27:56.000 --> 27:58.750
my hair seems to think this is the place.

Don't "but, but, but" me.

28:27.041 --> 28:28.208
Now, get moving!

Pirates have feelings too, you know.

28:32.333 --> 28:33.708
I don't believe it.

28:33.791 --> 28:37.666
I've got mites that work faster
than these guys.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.666

Okay. Let's grab it and go.

[Iago] You don't!

-[sizzles]
-It's quite romantic, but loud. [chuckles]

-We're all fine, but what's next?
-[gasps]

32:16.416 --> 32:19.000
[sighs] This must be the third challenge.

32:19.083 --> 32:21.750
Why do you think
there's a dragon on the door?

32:21.833 --> 32:25.166
It's probably just a metaphor
for slaying our emotional dragons.

32:25.250 --> 32:28.125
-[dragon growls, roars]
-[all gasp]

32:28.208 --> 32:29.666
Seems pretty literal.

32:30.833 --> 32:32.875
You should all get back to the ballroom.

32:34.875 --> 32:36.333
I can do this on my own.

32:36.416 --> 32:37.791
Not for a second.

32:37.875 --> 32:39.708
We've been through too much
to walk away now.

32:39.791 --> 32:42.541
We all want to help free your father
and defeat Gaston.

32:42.625 --> 32:46.958
No matter what's waiting for us
behind that door, we're in it together.

32:47.458 --> 32:50.458
I'm grateful for your friendship.

32:50.541 --> 32:54.583
Ladies, let's go slay all day! [screams]

32:55.291 --> 32:59.250

33:12.500 --> 33:15.333
Well? Should we search inside?

33:15.416 --> 33:17.250
Well, it's worked so far. Let's go.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.458
Well, this doesn't seem so bad.

33:24.541 --> 33:27.333
[dragon roars]

33:28.833 --> 33:33.666
At least, not if you imagine
the flames are something else altogether.

33:33.750 --> 33:36.916
Like smoke from the fireplace
of a cozy cottage.

33:37.000 --> 33:39.875
Yeah, I'm imagining the flames are
from the grill

33:39.958 --> 33:41.458
on a busy night at my restaurant.

33:41.541 --> 33:46.875
I'm imagining the flames are a star
guiding me home after a long journey.

33:46.958 --> 33:49.708
This maze could be my way to freedom.

33:49.791 --> 33:52.541
The unknown doesn't have to be scary.

33:53.541 --> 33:54.583
Ow!

33:54.666 --> 33:58.833
When I conquer this maze,
I'll see my father again.

33:58.916 --> 34:00.250
That's the spirit.

34:00.333 --> 34:02.916
And I have an axe!

34:03.458 --> 34:08.083
I've navigated through thorny situations,
but never actual thorns.

34:08.583 --> 34:10.791
Well, I guess this way's as good as any.

34:15.041 --> 34:16.083
[bird chirping]

34:16.166 --> 34:18.000
Oh. Hello, friend.

34:18.083 --> 34:19.458
Maybe you could-- [gasps]

34:19.541 --> 34:23.083
-Oh! I've never scared a bird before.
-[creaking]

34:23.166 --> 34:25.041

[echoes] Hello?

34:29.750 --> 34:30.875
[groans]

34:30.958 --> 34:33.875
This all feels like the same place.

34:33.958 --> 34:36.333
It's confusing, that's for sure.

34:36.416 --> 34:39.416
Look for any noticeable marks or signs
to track our way.

34:41.333 --> 34:43.583
Or make marks and signs.

34:43.666 --> 34:45.708
Amazing idea, Rapunzel.

34:45.791 --> 34:46.791
Thank you.

34:46.875 --> 34:48.041
I doubt it will help…

34:48.125 --> 34:50.125
-[creaking]
-…but at least it's cheerful.

34:50.208 --> 34:51.250

35:05.708 --> 35:06.708
This way.

35:08.875 --> 35:09.875
Gramma Tala!

35:10.750 --> 35:12.125
Wait, I can't--

35:12.208 --> 35:13.875
[panting]

35:15.125 --> 35:16.208
H-Hello?

35:17.333 --> 35:18.625
[creaking]

35:18.708 --> 35:20.000
Moana?

35:20.083 --> 35:21.291
Rapunzel?

35:21.916 --> 35:24.333
Where is everyone? We've lost them.

35:24.416 --> 35:26.291
Maybe they turned back.

35:26.375 --> 35:28.666
Maybe they decided not to help after all?

35:29.625 --> 35:32.875
Oh, I'm never going to save my father.

35:32.958 --> 35:35.250
[vines creaking]

35:35.333 --> 35:37.250
[gasps]

35:37.333 --> 35:38.375
Tiana?

35:38.458 --> 35:39.833
I'm here!

35:41.125 --> 35:42.666
Why did that happen?

35:43.166 --> 35:44.916
What is making the walls change?

35:47.583 --> 35:52.750
First I lose my animal friends,
then I lose my human friends.

35:53.250 --> 35:56.791
Without my friends, who even am I?

35:58.250 --> 35:59.708
Huh? [exclaims]

36:01.000 --> 36:03.125
I'll tell you who I am.

36:03.625 --> 36:05.041
I'm Snow White.

36:05.125 --> 36:08.875
I ate a poisoned apple
and lived to tell the tale.

36:08.958 --> 36:13.875
I kept a house full of seven bachelors
orderly and on task.

36:13.958 --> 36:16.625
I survived the Dark Forest.

36:16.708 --> 36:17.708
Twice!

36:18.291 --> 36:20.666
And I'm great with my axe!

36:22.000 --> 36:24.791
[grunting] Ooh.

36:24.875 --> 36:26.250
[rumbles]

36:28.541 --> 36:30.083
That's what I thought.

36:30.750 --> 36:34.333
[panting]
I shouldn't have stopped to paint.

36:34.916 --> 36:38.750
Now I'm trapped,
and I'm never getting out of here.

36:39.250 --> 36:41.708
[breathes deeply]

36:41.791 --> 36:43.333
No. I'm not trapped,

36:43.833 --> 36:47.125
because I will
never be held captive again.

36:47.625 --> 36:50.000
I will always find a way out.

36:50.083 --> 36:52.208
And I will always find the light!

36:52.291 --> 36:53.708
[rumbles]

36:53.791 --> 36:54.791
[exclaims]

36:59.541 --> 37:02.166
[exhales]
I've never been this lost before.

37:02.666 --> 37:04.916
Maybe I'm not as good a wayfinder
as I thought.

37:05.958 --> 37:08.083
Or maybe I'm not lost.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.375
Maybe I just need to trust myself.

37:11.458 --> 37:13.125
[rumbles]

37:14.625 --> 37:17.500
-And trust that I know the way.
-[rumbles]

37:19.291 --> 37:21.250
[groans]

37:21.333 --> 37:23.041
[gasps]

37:23.125 --> 37:25.583
[pants, screams]

37:26.083 --> 37:28.500
[groans] No, no, no, no, no.

37:28.583 --> 37:29.416
[gasps]

37:29.500 --> 37:30.625
No!

37:30.708 --> 37:34.416
I'm not gonna let
some overgrown rosebush defeat me!

37:34.500 --> 37:35.666
[rumbles]

37:36.541 --> 37:38.041
Ha! That's it!

37:38.125 --> 37:39.625
How did you do that?

37:39.708 --> 37:43.458
When we doubt ourselves,
the maze shifts and changes.

37:43.541 --> 37:46.000
-But when we crush that doubt…
-[rumbles]

37:46.083 --> 37:48.041
We crush the maze!

37:48.125 --> 37:50.041
[chuckles] Let's find the others.

37:50.875 --> 37:52.375
I can climb up there to spot them.

37:55.875 --> 37:56.875
Ow!

37:56.958 --> 37:59.291
Hold on. Before you climb up there--

38:01.833 --> 38:04.208
Some plants have saps that protect them.

38:04.291 --> 38:05.666
Give me your hand.

38:11.541 --> 38:12.375
[gasps]

38:12.458 --> 38:15.333
[groans, breathes shakily]

38:15.416 --> 38:18.291
[humming]

38:18.375 --> 38:19.375
[gasps] Huh?

38:21.041 --> 38:23.041
[vines creaking]

38:23.125 --> 38:25.458
Hmm. Where is she going?

38:29.333 --> 38:30.791
[rumbling]

38:30.875 --> 38:33.333
[gasps] They're ruining my maze!

38:33.416 --> 38:37.083
My beautiful, thorny, unbeatable maze!

38:37.166 --> 38:39.125
[grumbles]

38:39.791 --> 38:46.750
I'm going to get my big, shiny for--
uh, trident, no matter what it takes!

38:46.833 --> 38:50.083
[panting]

38:50.166 --> 38:52.291
We have a king to save.

38:53.000 --> 38:55.500
[vocalizing]

39:06.333 --> 39:08.500
[creaking, rumbles]

39:09.458 --> 39:12.208
-[vocalizing continues]
-[rumbling]

39:19.916 --> 39:21.916
[rumbling]

39:23.708 --> 39:25.833
[cheers] We did it!

39:25.916 --> 39:27.541
We conquered the maze!

39:27.625 --> 39:28.875
-[rumbling]
-Huh?

39:30.416 --> 39:31.500
[rock scrapes]

39:31.583 --> 39:33.625
[chuckles] It's the way out.

39:33.708 --> 39:34.833
Let's go.

39:34.916 --> 39:37.041
[growling]

39:37.125 --> 39:38.666
[all gasp]

39:42.416 --> 39:43.791
[roars]

39:46.583 --> 39:49.000
-Gaston.
-[Tiana] And a dragon?

39:49.083 --> 39:50.541
Do you happen to speak dragon?

39:50.625 --> 39:51.625
Of course!

39:51.708 --> 39:55.666
-[dragon growls, roars]
-[all screaming]

39:56.375 --> 39:58.041
But they aren't big talkers.

39:58.125 --> 40:00.291
Say goodbye, princesses!

40:00.375 --> 40:02.791
You don't stand a chance.

40:02.875 --> 40:05.375
-[Snow White grunts]
-We'll never give up, Gaston.

40:05.458 --> 40:08.083
[growls]

40:08.166 --> 40:10.500
Are we meant to defeat it
as the third challenge?

40:10.583 --> 40:11.708
I don't know.

40:11.791 --> 40:13.625
But it wouldn't be a fair fight.

40:13.708 --> 40:15.750
It has a damaged wing.

40:15.833 --> 40:19.208
[gasps] I bet that salve I made for Ariel
can help her.

40:19.291 --> 40:20.750
I'm going in.

40:20.833 --> 40:22.750
[Gaston] Food delivery, Maleficent.

40:23.333 --> 40:26.166
One princess, piping hot.

40:26.250 --> 40:27.625
[roars]

40:27.708 --> 40:29.208
[all gasp, grunt]

40:30.041 --> 40:33.916
-[Rapunzel, Ariel sigh]
-[imitates dragon]

40:34.000 --> 40:37.333
-[grumbles]
-[imitates dragon]

40:39.875 --> 40:42.125
-[Maleficent growling]
-Um.

40:42.708 --> 40:45.375
Hmm. Aha! Hmm.

40:46.250 --> 40:50.250
What are you doing, you bag of smoke?

40:50.333 --> 40:52.375
This dragon needs help.

40:57.125 --> 40:59.416
I don't care about a dragon. [grunts]

40:59.500 --> 41:03.541
I care about winning this challenge
and getting my trident!

41:03.625 --> 41:05.375
-[Maleficent growls]
-[screams, grunts]

41:07.958 --> 41:10.041
-[groans]
-[Maleficent growling]

41:11.541 --> 41:12.541
[Gaston groans]

41:13.208 --> 41:15.666
[screaming]

41:15.750 --> 41:18.541
It's not about the stuff you have, Gaston.

41:18.625 --> 41:20.208
Or the power you possess.

41:20.291 --> 41:22.208
[growls, roars]

41:22.291 --> 41:24.041
Ouch!

41:24.125 --> 41:25.291
That's hot!

41:25.375 --> 41:27.583
It's about what's in your heart.

41:27.666 --> 41:28.916
And the friends you make.

41:29.000 --> 41:31.875
And being nice to animals,
you rotten, no-good--

41:31.958 --> 41:33.458
[roars]

41:34.458 --> 41:35.875
-[rumbling]
-[gasps]

41:38.916 --> 41:40.041
Follow me.

41:40.125 --> 41:42.708
-[all grunt, panting]
-[exclaims, panting]

41:42.791 --> 41:43.625
[Ariel, Moana grunt]

41:43.708 --> 41:45.708
-[Tiana] Ooh.
-[all panting, grunting]

41:46.875 --> 41:48.875
-[Rapunzel] Ooh! [pants]

41:52.208 --> 41:54.041
-[Rapunzel grunts]
-[Tiana, Snow White pant]

41:54.125 --> 41:57.083
-Come on! Hurry!
-[Snow White grunts]

41:57.666 --> 41:59.041
-[Snow White grunts]
-[Ariel groans]

41:59.125 --> 42:00.375
[door slams]

42:00.458 --> 42:02.833
[gasps, whimpers]

42:02.916 --> 42:04.250
-[growls]
-[screams]

42:04.958 --> 42:07.166
Have you ever considered
a vegetarian diet?

42:07.250 --> 42:10.250
[growls, roars]

42:12.458 --> 42:15.083
-[chiming]
-[all grunting, sighing]

42:15.166 --> 42:17.375
-[Tiana, Snow White gasp]
-[gasps, pants] Daddy!

42:17.458 --> 42:18.625
[pants]

42:18.708 --> 42:20.166
We're too late.

42:20.250 --> 42:21.291
It's over.

42:22.208 --> 42:23.583
We can't give up now.

42:23.666 --> 42:25.541
-Look inside your heart.
-[sighs]

42:25.625 --> 42:28.333
-What's it telling you?
-It's telling me…

42:31.916 --> 42:34.833
that with my friends at my side…

42:37.500 --> 42:39.250
I can do anything.

42:44.083 --> 42:47.541
[chiming]

42:55.541 --> 42:58.583
-Return my father to the sea!
-[Tiana, Snow White grunt]

42:58.666 --> 43:00.500
[choir vocalizing]

43:00.583 --> 43:04.000
-[chiming]
-[all gasping]

43:04.083 --> 43:08.166
[fanfare]

43:10.500 --> 43:15.750
Because of you all,
the lands and oceans are safe.

43:16.250 --> 43:18.791
Thank you, royal heroes.

43:19.541 --> 43:24.791
Ariel, I do hope to see you
under the sea soon.

43:24.875 --> 43:27.291
[chuckles] Mm-hmm.

43:31.333 --> 43:37.375
-[gasps]
-[chiming, zapping]

43:39.000 --> 43:41.375
I couldn't have done this without you.

43:41.458 --> 43:42.458
Thank you.

43:42.541 --> 43:44.666
It was an amazing day.

43:44.750 --> 43:46.500
I learned so much about myself

43:46.583 --> 43:49.125
-and my new friends.
-[Tiana, Rapunzel chuckle]

43:49.208 --> 43:51.291
With all the secrets it contains,

43:51.375 --> 43:55.458
I can't help but wonder
if this castle was made for Gaston--

43:55.541 --> 43:57.708
Or made for us.

43:57.791 --> 44:00.541
The castle belongs to you, indeed.

44:00.625 --> 44:03.666
Stay as short or as long as you need.

44:03.750 --> 44:10.375
The magic doors in each of your rooms
will lead you home whenever you choose.

44:10.458 --> 44:11.875
Our rooms?

44:11.958 --> 44:14.625
[giggles] Should we search inside?

44:14.708 --> 44:15.708
[chuckles]

44:16.458 --> 44:18.208
[gasps, pants]

Mmm.

-Whoa. [gasps]

[giggles]

44:39.916 --> 44:41.250
[gasps]

44:41.333 --> 44:42.375
Oh.

44:42.875 --> 44:44.625
[gasps] Ah.

44:46.791 --> 44:48.541
-Oh!
-[Wardrobe chuckles]

44:49.041 --> 44:50.041
[Ariel] Mmm.
