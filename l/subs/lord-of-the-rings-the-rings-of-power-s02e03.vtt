00:06.666 --> 00:08.375
[Waldreg] Welcome to Mordor.

00:09.125 --> 00:10.916
Do you swear allegiance to Adar?

00:11.666 --> 00:13.458
[human prisoner screams]

00:13.458 --> 00:15.375
There is no one left for us to fear.

00:15.375 --> 00:17.458
There is one. An ancient sorcerer.

00:18.000 --> 00:20.625
Set my people free, and I will tell you
where he can be found.

00:20.750 --> 00:22.083
So you can destroy him.

00:22.625 --> 00:25.625
[grunting]

00:27.083 --> 00:28.125
Mother. Mother.

00:32.375 --> 00:33.916
- [Narvi] <i>A fire-mountain awoke.
- </i> [rumbling]

00:34.041 --> 00:38.500
[Narvi] <i>The ground-shakes it produced
spread through the bones of the earth,</i>

00:38.500 --> 00:41.083
collapsing our sun-shafts.

00:41.083 --> 00:44.583
[King Durin] The hand of darkness
has closed around Khazad-dûm.

00:44.583 --> 00:47.208
We can't hear the mountains anymore.

00:47.208 --> 00:50.791
At this very moment, all Middle-earth
balances on the brink of the abyss.

00:50.791 --> 00:53.750
And the Rings of Power are our last hope
of restoring the light.

00:53.750 --> 00:55.583
[Prince Durin IV]
It's some sort of invitation...

00:55.583 --> 00:58.291
from Lord Celebrimbor.

00:59.541 --> 01:02.291
[Galadriel] <i>The Island Kingdom of Númenor.</i>

01:02.791 --> 01:05.458
[Queen Míriel] <i>Seven Seeing Stones
there once were.</i>

01:05.458 --> 01:07.333
<i>This one was passed to my father.</i>

01:07.333 --> 01:10.000
[Elendil] Who is willing
to commit themselves

01:10.000 --> 01:11.625
to our Queen-regent's protection?

01:11.625 --> 01:13.583
- I will serve.
- [people exclaiming]

01:13.583 --> 01:15.333
- I will serve!
- I will serve!

01:15.333 --> 01:16.500
[people shouting]

01:16.500 --> 01:18.291
- [shouts] Pharazôn!
- [Kemen] Come with me.

01:18.291 --> 01:19.958
Why didn't he stop this?

01:19.958 --> 01:22.291
- He's loyal to her. Rightly or...
- Wrongly.

01:22.291 --> 01:24.875
[Kemen] Your cousin may hold the scepter,
but it's you the people follow.

01:24.875 --> 01:27.333
- With their help you could...
- [Pharazôn] Could what?

01:28.625 --> 01:29.666
Assert your influence.

01:29.875 --> 01:32.750
[rumbling, crackling]

01:33.416 --> 01:35.125
- Take shelter!
- The Queen!

01:35.791 --> 01:37.041
[Queen Míriel] No!

01:37.791 --> 01:38.708
[groans]

01:38.708 --> 01:39.916
No!

01:42.916 --> 01:44.083
[Valandil] Isildur!

01:44.750 --> 01:46.083
Where is my son?

01:47.541 --> 01:48.541
What is it?

01:50.166 --> 01:51.458
What do you see?

02:04.916 --> 02:06.791
[opening theme music playing]

03:37.083 --> 03:38.958
[Berek whinnies]

03:38.958 --> 03:40.041
[Elendil] Give him to me.

03:45.625 --> 03:46.625
No!

03:47.666 --> 03:50.041
You're going home. Do you hear me?

03:51.250 --> 03:52.708
You're coming with us.

03:53.958 --> 03:56.458
[grunting, neighing]

04:00.041 --> 04:02.666
Please, Berek.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.583
- Please.
- [Valandil] He won't listen to you.

04:08.375 --> 04:10.625
He won't listen to any of us.

04:19.125 --> 04:20.625
[Berek whinnies]

04:23.875 --> 04:26.583

05:03.875 --> 05:05.125
[grunts]

05:06.666 --> 05:08.916
Don't be afraid, four-legs.

05:08.916 --> 05:13.208
We ain't gonna eat ya... yet. [laughs]

05:13.208 --> 05:14.375
[Ravager Orc 1 grunts]

05:15.791 --> 05:18.083
- Yeah, got ya. [grunts]

No. Not yet.

05:26.791 --> 05:27.875

05:32.708 --> 05:33.833
[grunts]

05:35.208 --> 05:38.708
- No! It's getting away! After it!
- No! Let him go.

05:40.875 --> 05:43.041
That there's the Black Forest.

05:44.166 --> 05:46.375
Nothin' comes outta there alive.

05:46.375 --> 05:48.125

Berek.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.000
[sighs] My boy.

[hissing]

09:56.500 --> 09:58.458
[hushed chatter]

10:02.625 --> 10:07.291
[Elendil] As king he always protected
The Faithful. I shall miss him.

10:08.166 --> 10:10.666
You speak so freely of dead kings,

10:10.666 --> 10:13.041
yet you refuse
to utter your own son's name.

10:16.291 --> 10:20.541
You blame yourself but you needn't.
True blame belongs to another.

10:22.541 --> 10:23.958
What is it you're trying to say?

10:29.458 --> 10:34.083
So know this, our island will fall,
and there is still time...

10:34.875 --> 10:36.125
[gasps]

10:39.833 --> 10:40.833
[Elendil] What is it?

10:40.833 --> 10:42.666
[horn bellows]

10:42.666 --> 10:44.291
[intense music playing]

11:19.208 --> 11:20.375
Queen-regent.

11:21.208 --> 11:22.458
Captain.

11:23.833 --> 11:25.208
What do you see?

11:28.291 --> 11:30.625
The nobles from the North are here.

11:31.791 --> 11:35.250
It seems Lord Belzagar
has come to pay his respects.

11:35.250 --> 11:36.291
Hmm.

11:37.041 --> 11:39.916
One cannot pay what one does not have.

11:39.916 --> 11:43.000
Does Pharazôn have his ear
or is it the other way around?

11:44.750 --> 11:45.958
The latter.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.166
[indistinct chatter]

11:56.125 --> 11:57.333
Queen-regent?

11:59.000 --> 12:01.416
Is this how we repay our fallen?

12:03.125 --> 12:04.916
- It is only the beginning of our--
- No!

12:04.916 --> 12:06.916
[all exclaiming]

12:06.916 --> 12:09.500
Wait! [panting] Wait.

12:09.500 --> 12:10.583
[Queen Míriel exhales sharply]

12:10.583 --> 12:11.666
[all murmuring]

12:15.166 --> 12:16.416
Tell me.

12:18.833 --> 12:20.166
Who is it you lost?

12:21.208 --> 12:22.208
My son.

12:35.833 --> 12:38.875
[crying]

13:03.458 --> 13:05.333
- Your father's effects?
- Oh.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.875
I didn't hear you come in.

13:10.583 --> 13:12.250
Possessions of the dead.

13:12.250 --> 13:15.833
They become hallowed keys
into doors that are, now, forever shut.

13:16.750 --> 13:18.375
I remember when my father died.

13:19.166 --> 13:22.791
Looking at a cup, half-filled with wine
he'd drunk the night before.

13:22.791 --> 13:25.291
It seemed a betrayal to empty the glass,

13:26.333 --> 13:28.583
but he also hated wasting good wine.

13:30.458 --> 13:31.541
So, I drank it.

13:32.041 --> 13:33.541
Why are you here?

13:34.500 --> 13:39.166
Show me what you hide behind your back,
and I will tell you.

13:48.416 --> 13:49.833
Nothing, cousin.

13:54.791 --> 13:56.333
But it is time for you to choose.

13:58.125 --> 13:59.333
Your gown.

14:03.708 --> 14:09.125
Crimson, for Númenor's future,
or white, her past?

14:10.625 --> 14:11.791
What is the occasion?

14:12.625 --> 14:14.041
Your coronation.

14:16.291 --> 14:18.416
We have mourned the dead long enough.

14:18.958 --> 14:21.791
It is time that we attend
to the concerns of the living.

14:22.916 --> 14:24.416
My father wore white.

14:25.875 --> 14:27.791
That's all I can recall.

14:27.791 --> 14:29.958
That, and an eagle.

14:29.958 --> 14:32.750
It is rare for an eagle
to grace a coronation.

14:33.958 --> 14:39.625
Should one make an appearance at yours,
it would be seen as an auspicious omen.

14:41.208 --> 14:42.458
The white, then.

14:43.166 --> 14:44.750
I'm partial to the red.

14:45.791 --> 14:49.291
"Like the sun, rises a new monarch."

14:49.791 --> 14:53.333
It will show the people
you're a new kind of ruler for a new day.

14:54.375 --> 14:56.458
They need change.

14:56.458 --> 14:59.166
The white. It is humbler.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.208
As you prefer.

15:14.916 --> 15:17.708
[Kemen] She's the same as her father,
she's never going to change.

15:17.708 --> 15:21.083
She's suffered an infirmity.
She's no longer fit to rule.

15:21.083 --> 15:22.916
- [Lord Belzagar laughs]
- Why laugh? It's the truth.

15:22.916 --> 15:26.750
It is the ale talking.
It would be wise to lower its voice.

15:26.750 --> 15:28.625
All the same, the boy's not wrong.

15:29.458 --> 15:31.333
You were nearly chosen
to rule in her stead.

15:31.333 --> 15:35.000
Much of this land still believes
that yours was the better claim.

15:35.000 --> 15:39.458
And after Míriel's warmongering,
many are ready to raise it again.

15:42.416 --> 15:45.291
"Many" is hardly enough
to supplant a Queen.

15:45.291 --> 15:46.500
Queen-regent.

15:48.083 --> 15:49.333
A blind one.

15:51.041 --> 15:55.166
What if someone knew a way
to turn "many" into "enough"?

15:59.041 --> 16:01.875
In the event that someone did,
why would they not bring it forth?

16:04.250 --> 16:06.416
They might be afraid of what could happen.

16:13.375 --> 16:15.791
There is nothing to fear
at this table, my child.

16:25.916 --> 16:26.916
Eärien?

16:29.916 --> 16:31.666
Thought that was you.

16:31.666 --> 16:33.000
Valandil.

16:34.625 --> 16:36.375
You know, I thought Guilds-folk preferred

16:36.375 --> 16:38.375
to keep to the more fashionable part
of town.

16:38.375 --> 16:40.500
What are you doing in the Old Quarter?

16:40.500 --> 16:42.000
- We came here to bury a king.
- Hmm.

16:43.375 --> 16:45.625
The Valar rest him and keep him.

16:45.625 --> 16:47.458
I should've liked to have been there.

16:47.458 --> 16:49.666
Pity members of the common soldiery
weren't invited.

16:50.958 --> 16:53.458
Especially given
the low class of folk that were.

16:55.333 --> 16:58.000
Did you just insult my father?

16:58.000 --> 16:59.958
No, I believe I insulted you.

17:02.416 --> 17:05.000
I bled with the Queen on the battlefield.

17:06.250 --> 17:09.083
I watched her walk into an inferno
to save lives.

17:09.833 --> 17:12.833
To try and save her brother's life.

17:16.166 --> 17:20.166
You speak ill of the Queen again,
it'll be you, suffers an infirmity.

17:21.375 --> 17:23.291
Have I made myself plain?

17:26.000 --> 17:28.208
Or need we settle this
through other means?

17:35.250 --> 17:37.666
Plain enough for today.

17:48.166 --> 17:50.000
Well, I'd say that's worth another ale.

17:52.708 --> 17:55.791
[Pharazôn] What was it
you were about to say, Eärien?

17:55.791 --> 17:58.666
[suspenseful music playing]

17:58.666 --> 18:00.875
[Eärien] <i>I found something...</i>

18:02.125 --> 18:05.250
[clicking]

18:09.083 --> 18:11.166
<i>Something secret.</i>

18:19.708 --> 18:21.708
<i>Something dangerous.</i>

18:26.333 --> 18:28.083
<i>Something forbidden.</i>

18:35.458 --> 18:37.250
[whimpering]

18:52.541 --> 18:55.625
[Glüg] The preparations
are nearly complete, Lord-father.

18:56.458 --> 18:59.625
But... we are safe here.

18:59.625 --> 19:00.958
[indistinct shouting]

19:00.958 --> 19:02.291
We have a home.

19:03.416 --> 19:05.416
Must we go to war again?

19:07.000 --> 19:12.000
You told me Sauron was dead.
Let us leave him that way.

19:13.666 --> 19:17.333
There are some dangers in this world about
which it is a father's burden to know.

19:17.333 --> 19:19.416
And a son's burden to trust him.

19:19.416 --> 19:21.041
Trust me, my son,

19:21.041 --> 19:24.333
when I tell you
that we will never truly be safe,

19:24.333 --> 19:27.791
until we've made certain
Sauron is no more.

19:28.791 --> 19:31.083
As you will it, Lord-father.

19:33.333 --> 19:34.333
[Orc] Be off, will ya?

19:36.416 --> 19:38.833
[baby Orc crying]

19:44.333 --> 19:46.125
[thumping footsteps approaching]

19:46.125 --> 19:48.333
[sinister music playing]

19:53.333 --> 19:56.125
[growling]

20:18.541 --> 20:23.875
[in Black Speech] Damrod.
Hill-troll of the Ered Mithrin.

20:23.875 --> 20:28.041
- Killer of stone giants.
- [sighs]

20:28.041 --> 20:30.916
Eater of Dragon bones.

20:31.750 --> 20:33.375
Welcome.

20:37.625 --> 20:41.125
[groans]

20:44.333 --> 20:46.541
[in English] I gather
you received our message.

20:50.791 --> 20:54.083
Where is Sauron?

20:56.041 --> 20:59.250
[Damrod growls]

21:02.791 --> 21:05.375
[Celebrimbor] Welcome.
Thank you for making the journey.

21:06.250 --> 21:08.791
You need not
hide your troubles here.

21:08.791 --> 21:11.000
We have no intention
to take advantage of them,

21:11.000 --> 21:13.458
simply, to, to render aid.

21:14.166 --> 21:16.041
As you once did us.

21:16.041 --> 21:19.833
And exactly what aid
do you think you could provide?

21:21.666 --> 21:22.875
Rings.

21:23.708 --> 21:26.666
One for each of Middle-earth's
most powerful Dwarf-lords.

21:27.916 --> 21:30.833
You brought us here to barter jewelry?

21:30.833 --> 21:32.208
[sighs softly]

21:32.208 --> 21:36.541
These Rings will be
beyond any power yet devised

21:36.541 --> 21:39.666
by Dwarf, or Man, or Elf.

21:43.375 --> 21:45.666
They shall be Rings of Power.

21:49.083 --> 21:51.166
Power to heal your mountain.

21:52.708 --> 21:55.416
Just as they have healed our Great Tree.

21:57.791 --> 21:58.958
Elrond...

21:59.708 --> 22:01.083
The <i>mithril?</i>

22:02.250 --> 22:04.291
<i>Mithril</i> has reversed our fortunes.

22:05.583 --> 22:07.416
I believe it can do the same for yours.

22:09.125 --> 22:11.583
Perhaps, for all the peoples
of Middle-earth.

22:12.791 --> 22:17.583
If we provide you with a steady supply,
is that the sum of it?

22:18.208 --> 22:22.541
<i>Mithril,</i> for Rings. Yes.

22:22.541 --> 22:25.083
[Disa] A generous offer, Lord Celebrimbor,

22:25.083 --> 22:27.500
but why not take it to our King?

22:27.500 --> 22:31.416
For Durin the Elder
has always been hesitant

22:31.416 --> 22:33.666
to accept outside aid.

22:33.666 --> 22:38.416
But if our proposal
was brought to him instead

22:38.416 --> 22:40.041
by one of his own...

22:40.041 --> 22:43.333
My father and I
are no longer on speaking terms.

22:43.333 --> 22:44.250
What Durin means--

22:44.250 --> 22:46.291
You'd sooner convince an Orc

22:46.291 --> 22:49.625
to sit for a sun-bath,
than get the two of us in a room together.

22:49.625 --> 22:52.208
I'm afraid, I'd be of little help.

22:52.208 --> 22:54.416
[Annatar] We summoned you here
to help you.

22:58.291 --> 23:01.125
Bringing your father
a means of saving his kingdom

23:01.625 --> 23:04.041
might be just the way
to earn back his respect.

23:06.166 --> 23:08.000
Perhaps, even your inheritance.

23:08.000 --> 23:11.458
I'm sorry, who exactly are you?

23:11.458 --> 23:13.083
Yes, forgive me. This is--

23:13.083 --> 23:16.333
A friend. To the Elves.

23:17.166 --> 23:19.625
And to the Dwarves. Nothing more.

23:21.291 --> 23:24.416
I see. And where's Elrond?

23:24.416 --> 23:27.291
Lindon's restoration
demands his full attention.

23:27.791 --> 23:29.166
Does it now?

23:31.000 --> 23:34.666
I assure you, Herald Elrond
said he could think of little else

23:34.666 --> 23:36.791
than helping his Dwarven friends.

23:36.791 --> 23:38.375
He speaks of you so fondly.

23:39.875 --> 23:41.416
Funny.

23:41.416 --> 23:45.250
He's never mentioned you. Lord...

23:45.250 --> 23:46.750
Annatar.

23:47.375 --> 23:48.208
Uh-huh.

23:49.583 --> 23:53.041
Elrond said that you were
the wisest of all the Dwarves.

23:54.250 --> 23:58.791
Did he speak true, or is there
someone else we should be treating with?

24:01.791 --> 24:04.583
My Lords, you've given us
much to consider.

24:04.583 --> 24:07.958
Might we have a wee moment to,
uh, to mull it over?

24:07.958 --> 24:10.583
- I am afraid we--
- [Celebrimbor] Certainly!

24:12.541 --> 24:14.375
Take whatever time you need.

24:18.791 --> 24:22.208
What were you thinking?
Were you trying to pick a fight?

24:22.208 --> 24:24.375
I was thinking, whoever that Annatar is,

24:24.375 --> 24:26.458
he doesn't know Elrond
from a hole in the ground.

24:26.458 --> 24:27.625
How do you know?

24:27.625 --> 24:30.125
'Cause Elrond would never say
such nice things about me.

24:30.125 --> 24:33.000
Aren't you in the least bit relieved?

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
Uh... [sighs]

24:34.583 --> 24:37.916
Yes, but magic rings?

24:38.875 --> 24:41.500
Does no part of this sound strange to you?

24:41.500 --> 24:43.333
That's for your father to decide.

24:44.375 --> 24:47.541
Be hard for him to decide
about a proposal he never hears.

24:47.541 --> 24:49.291
Is that what this is about?

24:49.916 --> 24:51.458
It is, isn't it?

24:51.458 --> 24:54.750
You'd sooner let our entire mountain
roast and rot,

24:54.750 --> 24:56.583
than have to say you were sorry.

24:56.583 --> 25:00.833
You'd sooner feed our family slugworms,
than admit to him that you--

25:00.833 --> 25:03.166
I wasn't wrong.

25:03.166 --> 25:04.583
[Disa] I agree.

25:05.666 --> 25:07.291
But you're wrong now.

25:08.458 --> 25:11.791
I don't care if they're magic earrings.

25:11.791 --> 25:16.458
If there's even a hope of a solution here,
no matter how farfetched,

25:16.458 --> 25:18.458
our King needs to know about it.

25:19.333 --> 25:24.083
Either you bring news of this
to your father, or I will.

25:29.416 --> 25:31.833
[Celebrimbor] <i>There is a saying,
in Khazad-dûm,</i>

25:31.833 --> 25:34.875
"The slow drip splits the boulder."

25:37.583 --> 25:39.208
So give them time.

25:41.875 --> 25:43.833
And time is a luxury we lack.

25:45.125 --> 25:47.375
Supposing your High King
were to discover...

25:51.250 --> 25:52.875
What about the High King?

25:55.166 --> 25:56.750
No, I should not.

25:57.458 --> 26:00.791
No. Say what? Speak plain.

26:02.291 --> 26:06.791
Your High King believes the Dwarves
to be unworthy of this power.

26:10.375 --> 26:14.166
In fact, he has forbidden
the forging of any more Rings at all.

26:16.916 --> 26:19.333
And the truth is he
does not even know I am here.

26:25.208 --> 26:30.375
Well. What business is it of his,
how I conduct myself in my own realm?

26:30.375 --> 26:32.166
- Celebrimbor--
- No!

26:33.583 --> 26:36.125
Countless lives are at risk.

26:36.125 --> 26:40.750
We have not the time to bandy words about,
convincing him who is worthy of aid.

26:42.375 --> 26:45.583
[Annatar] Nevertheless, sooner or later,
Gil-galad will discover the truth.

26:47.500 --> 26:48.666
Supposing he doesn't?

26:52.541 --> 26:53.958
[Annatar] What are you doing?

26:56.750 --> 27:02.000
I am congratulating the High King
on the efficacy of The Three

27:03.166 --> 27:06.166
and telling him
that I am closing up the forge.

27:07.541 --> 27:10.541
With a promise to join him in Lindon
as soon as possible.

27:17.333 --> 27:19.083
You would lie to your High King?

27:23.000 --> 27:25.833
I would grant us the space
to complete our work.

27:27.583 --> 27:31.083
I have spent an age preparing for this.

27:32.041 --> 27:33.708
I have apprenticed, I have studied,

27:33.708 --> 27:35.625
I have reached
the very height of my craft.

27:38.583 --> 27:40.708
This... This is my moment.

27:45.041 --> 27:46.875
Now, he will not take it away.

27:50.750 --> 27:51.666
[clears throat]

27:54.583 --> 27:56.333
[foreboding music playing]

28:14.500 --> 28:16.000
[wind whistling]

28:19.000 --> 28:20.666
[bird cawing]

28:21.666 --> 28:23.000
[hooves clopping]

28:27.250 --> 28:28.791
[Isildur breathing heavily]

28:30.583 --> 28:31.458
[grunts]

28:32.500 --> 28:34.333
[panting]

28:37.458 --> 28:38.458
[breath trembling]

29:36.541 --> 29:37.708
[insects buzzing]

29:39.625 --> 29:41.000
[Isildur breathing heavily]

29:45.791 --> 29:46.916
[Berek grunting]

29:55.166 --> 29:57.041
[birds chirping]

30:06.583 --> 30:07.625
[groans]

30:28.375 --> 30:31.583
[both grunting]

30:33.708 --> 30:36.000
[both panting]

30:36.000 --> 30:38.333
Sorry, sorry, sorry! I'm so sorry.

30:38.333 --> 30:40.125
I thought you were an Orc!

30:45.583 --> 30:46.666
[grunts]

30:46.666 --> 30:48.333
- [breath trembling]
- [Estrid sighs]

30:48.333 --> 30:51.791
[grunts] It's all right. Doesn't hurt. Oh!

30:51.791 --> 30:54.958
Doesn't hurt? Of course it hurts,
I just stabbed you in the thigh!

30:54.958 --> 30:56.833
[breathing heavily] Could've been worse.

30:56.833 --> 30:59.416
- Here, let me pull it out.
- No, don't-- [grunts]

31:00.541 --> 31:02.166
- You're meant to leave it in!
- Was I?

31:02.166 --> 31:04.166
Yes! Whenever you're stabbed,
you leave it in.

31:04.166 --> 31:06.666
- I've never been stabbed before!
- [grunts] Neither have I!

31:10.291 --> 31:11.666
You sure it doesn't hurt?

31:11.666 --> 31:13.208
No, now it hurts.

31:13.208 --> 31:14.666
Sorry. I, uh...

31:16.333 --> 31:17.416
- Here.
- [groans]

31:18.625 --> 31:20.625
No, stop. I'll do it.

31:20.625 --> 31:25.000
[breathing heavily] Oh! Ah!

31:25.000 --> 31:26.291
Let me.

31:29.208 --> 31:30.875
[groans]

31:37.916 --> 31:39.083
I'm Estrid.

31:40.416 --> 31:41.833
Isildur.

31:42.875 --> 31:46.083
You're Sea-folk.
Were you headed for the ridgeline?

31:47.916 --> 31:50.291
The survivors will be waiting for us
where we made camp.

31:50.291 --> 31:51.833
My father, too.

31:54.750 --> 31:56.875
I think you may have missed them.

31:58.541 --> 32:00.250
You don't know my father.

32:06.666 --> 32:08.666
You've already been there, haven't you?

32:10.208 --> 32:11.875
I was searchin' for someone too.

32:14.125 --> 32:16.416
Nothin' left but hoofprints and mud.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.500
But... I found this.

32:27.250 --> 32:30.125
Here. And there's a path marked.

32:33.333 --> 32:34.500
"Pelargir."

32:34.500 --> 32:38.500
Of course. Father didn't leave,
he led everyone there.

32:39.250 --> 32:40.750
Your folk too, any luck.

32:43.500 --> 32:45.166
[birds chirping]

33:17.916 --> 33:19.500
[Isildur] I didn't see
any ships in the harbor.

33:20.375 --> 33:21.375
Keep hope.

33:22.458 --> 33:24.666
There's no telling
who we'll find down there.

33:25.541 --> 33:27.166
You hoping to find kin as well?

33:29.583 --> 33:31.000
My betrothed.

33:38.458 --> 33:39.458
[old man groaning]

33:43.875 --> 33:45.166
- Don't.
- [Isildur grunts]

33:52.500 --> 33:55.291
- What's happened?
- Orcs.

33:58.083 --> 34:00.958
Was on me way to Pelargir
when they waylaid me.

34:00.958 --> 34:03.875
- Took everything.
- Can you travel?

34:05.041 --> 34:06.375
Look at me.

34:12.791 --> 34:14.291
We ought to keep movin'.

34:14.791 --> 34:16.916
Least we can do is give him
something to eat.

34:32.500 --> 34:33.541
[sinister music playing]

34:35.291 --> 34:36.916
- [grunts]
- Ah!

34:36.916 --> 34:38.250
Estrid, go!

34:38.250 --> 34:40.208
[all grunting]

34:40.208 --> 34:43.083
[Berek whinnying]

34:43.083 --> 34:44.291
Grab hold!

34:45.750 --> 34:48.041
[yells, grunts]

34:49.083 --> 34:52.291
[Isildur grunts]

34:52.291 --> 34:53.333
[all grunting]

34:53.333 --> 34:54.416
Berek!

34:57.750 --> 34:59.708
You should've listened to the girl.

35:05.166 --> 35:08.291
[wildman 1] Go! Get the horse.
Get on. Go! Let's go.

35:08.291 --> 35:11.250
[panting]

35:16.125 --> 35:17.750
[all grunting]

35:17.750 --> 35:21.791
[wildman 3] Move. Get down. Come on.
Let's go. Come on. Come on.

35:50.333 --> 35:51.625
[Isildur] Thank you.

35:53.000 --> 35:56.083
It's Isildur. Remember?

35:57.166 --> 35:59.500
Elven memories do not dim.

36:05.791 --> 36:09.083
Wildmen outnumber us
many to one in these woods.

36:12.875 --> 36:15.708
My horse. I can't abandon him.

36:15.708 --> 36:18.875
Settle your own affairs as seems you best.

36:18.875 --> 36:20.625
I have my own to attend to.

36:21.833 --> 36:23.333
In Pelargir.

36:24.083 --> 36:25.416
What affairs?

36:41.333 --> 36:43.833
[somber music playing]

37:57.416 --> 37:59.125
[breath trembling]

38:53.291 --> 38:56.583
[Dwarf 1] Narvi, Narvi!
Tell the King about the weans.

38:56.583 --> 39:01.083
[Narvi] We're doin' what we can. I see.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.041
Well, we'll do what we can.

39:04.041 --> 39:05.791
I know, I know.

39:05.791 --> 39:08.708
[Dwarf 2] Narvi, does the King know
the children are hungry?

39:08.708 --> 39:09.791
[Narvi] Have patience.

39:09.791 --> 39:10.958
[Dwarf 3] Narvi, come on.

39:10.958 --> 39:12.625
Speak the truth, Narvi.

39:12.625 --> 39:14.625
I'm speaking with the King now.

39:18.708 --> 39:20.833
[Dwarf 5] Speak to the King on our behalf.

39:21.833 --> 39:22.833
[Dwarf 6] Narvi.

39:24.583 --> 39:28.166
[Narvi] Sire.
The food-merchants are outside.

39:28.833 --> 39:33.333
Um, they're going to petition you
to open the royal grain-reserves.

39:35.166 --> 39:36.958
How long will the reserves last?

39:37.958 --> 39:40.916
By most accounts... Three months.

39:43.083 --> 39:44.166
Send them in.

39:45.291 --> 39:46.500
Sire.

39:47.208 --> 39:48.208
You can go.

40:37.000 --> 40:42.750
Celebrimbor claims these Rings will
give us the power to solve our dilemma.

40:44.666 --> 40:50.625
I felt it my duty as a Dwarf
to bring you his offer.

40:54.333 --> 40:56.250
Is that all you come to say?

40:57.541 --> 40:58.875
No.

41:02.041 --> 41:03.250
What else?

41:03.250 --> 41:04.791
That I am your son.

41:07.958 --> 41:11.666
I'm hard as you, stubborn as you.

41:13.583 --> 41:16.458
As crusted with pride. And, uh...

41:20.666 --> 41:22.083
I was wrong.

41:26.875 --> 41:29.083
I was wrong to disrespect you.

41:31.083 --> 41:32.458
And...

41:34.166 --> 41:35.583
I'm sorry.

41:40.833 --> 41:42.250
You look terrible.

41:45.416 --> 41:46.375
[scoffs]

41:48.000 --> 41:50.125
Miners have calloused fists.

41:52.166 --> 41:54.000
Their punches land hard.

41:56.166 --> 41:57.958
Wait till your children grow up.

42:05.958 --> 42:07.458
Father, uh...

42:09.958 --> 42:13.666
this power in Eregion, I don't trust it.

42:16.708 --> 42:18.291
You told me once,

42:19.041 --> 42:23.333
the fate of Elves is decided
by wiser minds than our own.

42:24.416 --> 42:27.375
That to try and alter it,
to try and cheat death,

42:28.583 --> 42:31.208
might lead to an even greater catastrophe.

42:35.041 --> 42:36.458
I keep wondering...

42:39.541 --> 42:41.541
What if you were right?

42:46.416 --> 42:48.333
[squelching]

42:48.333 --> 42:49.750
[Isildur winces]

42:49.750 --> 42:51.958
Did your mother teach you how to do this?

42:54.750 --> 42:56.041
What happened?

42:57.250 --> 42:58.875
What d'you think happened?

43:00.625 --> 43:06.625
[Arondir] I failed. Failed to stop Adar.
Failed... to protect her.

43:07.833 --> 43:10.625
I thought she was getting better.

43:10.625 --> 43:16.125
There is a foulness in Orc arrows
not easily forgotten by human flesh.

43:23.791 --> 43:25.541
Pleases me to see you, Isildur.

43:26.250 --> 43:28.833
So few who slept in the fire
made it this far,

43:29.666 --> 43:31.875
save those who took the Mark of Adar.

43:34.583 --> 43:37.000
I wish I could share my relief
with your father.

43:38.583 --> 43:39.500
[sighs softly]

43:41.166 --> 43:43.291
He did not abandon you.

43:46.750 --> 43:48.583
Númenor will return.

43:49.625 --> 43:51.750
Your family will be whole again.

44:01.083 --> 44:02.875
<i>These people are fortunate you're here.</i>

44:02.875 --> 44:05.375
[indistinct chatter]

44:07.000 --> 44:08.583
This village needs a healer.

44:11.458 --> 44:13.541
Their healer just burned on a pyre.

44:18.166 --> 44:19.750
[Arondir] What do you know of Beleriand?

44:21.250 --> 44:23.125
[Theo] Elf-city, wasn't it?

44:24.125 --> 44:25.958
[Arondir] An entire Elf-realm.

44:31.083 --> 44:32.500
I was born there.

44:35.250 --> 44:37.000
Now, it lies under the wave.

44:41.583 --> 44:45.500
After it fell, I felt such anger.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.416
Toward Morgoth.

44:47.416 --> 44:51.041
But I felt the most anger towards myself.

44:57.958 --> 45:02.791
It is a thirst
that can never be slaked, Theo.

45:03.750 --> 45:06.583
And in the end it will drink you dry.

45:07.375 --> 45:10.000
All right, yeah. More can do it
in the same time, yeah.

45:19.083 --> 45:21.083
All those years you were watching us...

45:22.458 --> 45:24.500
d'you ever know my father?

45:24.500 --> 45:27.250
No. I did not.

45:28.416 --> 45:29.750
Neither did I.

45:31.083 --> 45:35.208
But I know this much, he wasn't you.

45:37.458 --> 45:41.083
And anything you were to me, is ashes now.

45:43.041 --> 45:47.166
So for my part,
we don't ever need to speak again.

45:56.750 --> 45:58.541
[female villager] Fetch me
some more of that wood, lad.

45:58.541 --> 46:00.333
Yeah, from that pile there. Yeah.

46:16.375 --> 46:18.041
This is from old Númenor.

46:18.833 --> 46:22.458
Some fountain. Barely spits a drop.

46:22.458 --> 46:26.333
It's not a fountain. It's an aqueduct.

46:26.333 --> 46:28.833
It's supposed to bring water
into your homes.

46:30.416 --> 46:32.500
Men can't build things like that.

46:33.083 --> 46:36.333
In Númenor, we can. You should see it.

46:37.583 --> 46:40.125
If it's so grand, why'd you leave?

46:41.083 --> 46:43.500
Heard there were grander things
in Middle-earth.

46:43.500 --> 46:44.750
[chuckles sarcastically]

46:45.416 --> 46:46.291
[chuckles softly]

46:50.083 --> 46:51.916
D'you really want your horse back?

46:53.833 --> 46:55.000
You know where he is?

46:56.875 --> 46:59.833
Meet me here. Tonight. Moonrise.

47:01.750 --> 47:03.208
Bring a sword.

47:13.541 --> 47:15.083
[Isildur] Don't burn yourself.

47:19.041 --> 47:20.875
Any word of your intended?

47:22.791 --> 47:23.791
No.

47:26.458 --> 47:31.458
He'll make it. If he's even
half as strong as you, I'm certain of it.

47:35.416 --> 47:37.708
I'm not so strong as you think.

47:42.833 --> 47:45.833
It's hard, not to blame myself.

47:47.583 --> 47:48.833
What for?

47:50.166 --> 47:51.625
Being alive.

47:54.416 --> 47:59.000
For surviving. When so many others didn't.

48:05.000 --> 48:07.500
I was ten when I lost my mother.

48:11.250 --> 48:13.291
Swam out further than I was supposed to.

48:16.250 --> 48:18.000
Got caught in a riptide.

48:21.750 --> 48:23.333
She drowned.

48:26.541 --> 48:28.166
Saving my life.

48:32.000 --> 48:33.625
After my mum--

48:38.166 --> 48:42.583
[sniffling] I keep wondering
what it's like for her now.

48:46.291 --> 48:48.500
Sometimes, I see mine in dreams.

48:55.708 --> 48:58.125
You seem to have found peace with it.

48:58.875 --> 49:00.041
No.

49:02.125 --> 49:06.625
The truth is, what I just told you,

49:08.500 --> 49:10.416
back home, nobody knows.

49:12.875 --> 49:14.708
I just told them she drowned.

49:19.416 --> 49:21.416
Nobody knows it was my fault.

49:26.625 --> 49:28.375
Ever since, I've felt bound.

49:31.916 --> 49:34.625
To try and do something singular.

49:35.500 --> 49:36.958
Something special.

49:41.916 --> 49:44.291
To try and find a way
to earn what she did.

49:50.708 --> 49:54.083
I don't know
if you can earn a thing like that.

49:54.583 --> 49:57.916
I think you just have to accept it,
as a gift.

49:58.541 --> 50:01.791
One she gave freely
because you were precious to her.

50:10.500 --> 50:11.833
[Theo] Isildur.

50:33.208 --> 50:36.291
[suspenseful music playing]

50:48.375 --> 50:50.833
[music intensifies]

50:56.875 --> 50:58.500
[grunts]

51:04.125 --> 51:06.916
[thudding]

51:09.250 --> 51:11.750
[indistinct chatter]

51:38.250 --> 51:40.000
- [Berek chuffs]
- [shushes]

51:58.666 --> 52:00.166
[Berek grunts]

52:02.875 --> 52:03.958
Someone's out there.

52:05.291 --> 52:09.375
[Ammred] Just them trotters we stole.
I'll quiet 'em down again.

52:10.666 --> 52:11.916
[intense music playing]

52:18.208 --> 52:19.458
[Theo] Share your fire?

52:25.958 --> 52:28.875
[Hagen] What are you doin' out here
in the dark, boy?

52:29.375 --> 52:30.708
Lose your mum?

52:34.125 --> 52:35.416
I'm one o' you.

52:39.125 --> 52:40.375
I serve Adar.

52:49.250 --> 52:50.958
That's not Adar's brand.

52:50.958 --> 52:54.125
It's proof I've done more for him
than any of you can claim.

52:54.833 --> 52:55.916
Try us.

52:59.500 --> 53:00.708
- [wildman gasps]
- [axe thuds]

53:02.375 --> 53:06.416
Look how well-fed he is.
I'll wager this one comes from Pelargir.

53:06.416 --> 53:10.208
Are you here to attack us, lad?
Same as your folk done the others?

53:10.208 --> 53:11.500
We've never attacked you.

53:11.500 --> 53:13.375
You attacked three of our camps.

53:15.541 --> 53:16.916
Hold him!

53:19.583 --> 53:20.791
[whooshes]

53:21.375 --> 53:22.458
[Wildwoman] No!

53:23.625 --> 53:24.708
[Theo panting]

53:25.708 --> 53:26.791
It's an ambush!

53:26.791 --> 53:30.750
[wildmen screaming]

53:36.375 --> 53:37.375
[wildman] Help!

53:38.416 --> 53:39.500
[gasps]

53:39.500 --> 53:41.166
[rumbling]

53:41.166 --> 53:43.000
[growling]

53:46.958 --> 53:48.000
[Theo screams]

53:48.500 --> 53:49.500
Isildur!

53:49.500 --> 53:51.625
- [panting]
- [Berek grunts]

53:51.625 --> 53:54.625
Theo! Theo!

53:55.666 --> 53:57.125
[bell tolling]

54:00.166 --> 54:02.041
[dramatic music playing]

55:10.750 --> 55:12.166
[man 1] Queen of lies!

55:12.166 --> 55:15.583
[people murmuring]

55:15.583 --> 55:17.541
[man 2] She's unfit to rule!

55:17.541 --> 55:22.083
No voice but the prayer
of a king or a queen

55:22.083 --> 55:25.625
is permitted during this ceremony.

55:26.833 --> 55:27.916
And yet...

55:30.625 --> 55:33.833
the grief of Númenor is sacred to me.

55:36.000 --> 55:39.791
Your pain, a prayer within these walls.

55:42.333 --> 55:47.250
I hear your sorrow, and your anger.

55:49.291 --> 55:50.708
I share it.

55:54.708 --> 55:58.500
We have bloodied and been bloodied.

56:02.750 --> 56:08.375
But know this... We will find our course.

56:13.500 --> 56:17.291
Should there be another among us
who feels moved to speak...

56:20.833 --> 56:23.166
firstly ask yourself this,

56:25.500 --> 56:27.583
for whom do you cry out?

56:30.125 --> 56:32.333
For those we have already buried?

56:34.708 --> 56:36.458
For your kingdom?

56:38.666 --> 56:40.583
Or for yourself?

56:43.041 --> 56:44.666
[Eärien] For Isildur.

56:44.666 --> 56:46.208
[people exclaiming]

56:53.458 --> 56:57.041
With his dying words,
the King spoke to me,

56:57.958 --> 57:02.708
and said it was from this...
she took counsel.

57:03.666 --> 57:05.541
[people clamoring]

57:05.541 --> 57:10.166
It is because of this,
our kinsmen died in Middle-earth!

57:10.166 --> 57:12.791
This Elf-stone is your queen!

57:12.791 --> 57:14.291
Silence!

57:14.291 --> 57:15.583
[clamor dies down]

57:17.833 --> 57:19.916
- [thudding]
- [all exclaiming]

57:26.333 --> 57:27.750
Lies.

57:29.791 --> 57:35.125
Númenor's true ruler would
never place trust in an Elvish artifact.

57:39.000 --> 57:41.000
Take it away and destroy it.

57:41.000 --> 57:42.500
[Queen Míriel] No!

57:47.791 --> 57:49.291
The <i>palantír</i> is mine.

57:49.291 --> 57:51.625
[people exclaiming]

57:55.916 --> 57:57.291
We need it.

57:59.833 --> 58:01.583
- [warbles]
- [screams]

58:01.583 --> 58:04.541
- [man 1] Elf sorcery!
- Murderer!

58:05.041 --> 58:08.041
[people yelling]
Queen of lies! Queen of lies!

58:08.041 --> 58:10.541
- Dark magic!
- [woman 1] To the Queen.

58:10.541 --> 58:13.208
- [Queen Míriel] Stop! Stop!
- [soldier] Stand down.

58:13.208 --> 58:17.416
[all screaming and yelling]

58:19.125 --> 58:20.125
[Elendil] Míriel!

58:20.625 --> 58:22.625
- [woman 2] My Queen!
- [Elendil] Míriel!

58:22.625 --> 58:23.666
[woman 3] Save my Queen!

58:23.666 --> 58:25.041
[Elendil] Míriel!

58:25.791 --> 58:26.791
Take my hand.

58:30.416 --> 58:32.541
- Míriel! Míriel!
- [shudders]

58:32.541 --> 58:34.166
[distant shrieking]

58:38.041 --> 58:39.875
- [shrieking]
- [whooshing]

58:42.250 --> 58:43.625
[squawks]

58:43.625 --> 58:45.041
[all exclaiming]

58:49.041 --> 58:50.083
[chitters]

58:52.833 --> 58:55.708
[eagle shrieks]

58:56.708 --> 58:58.708
[captivating music playing]

59:16.916 --> 59:20.041
[shrieking]

59:26.458 --> 59:32.041
Pharazôn! Pharazôn! Pharazôn! Pharazôn!

59:32.041 --> 59:34.541
The eagle favors Pharazôn!

59:34.541 --> 59:38.541
[people chanting] Pharazôn! Pharazôn!
Pharazôn! Pharazôn!

59:38.541 --> 59:44.083
Pharazôn! Pharazôn! Pharazôn!
Pharazôn! Pharazôn!

59:44.083 --> 59:48.541
Pharazôn! Pharazôn! Pharazôn! Pharazôn!

59:48.541 --> 59:52.916
- Pharazôn! Pharazôn! Pharazôn! Pharazôn!
- [shrieking]

59:52.916 --> 01:00:02.291
Pharazôn! Pharazôn! Pharazôn! Pharazôn!

01:00:17.166 --> 01:00:19.041
- [sizzling]
- [ominous music playing]

01:01:31.291 --> 01:01:34.416
[disembodied voices whispering]

01:01:45.125 --> 01:01:47.041
[closing theme music playing]
