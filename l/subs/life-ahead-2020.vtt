NETFLIX PRESENTS

01:08.916 --> 01:12.166
Have some water, honey.
It's hot, we've had a long trip.

01:12.250 --> 01:14.375
Are you tired? Come on.

01:14.458 --> 01:17.250
Sit and have a sip of water.

01:17.916 --> 01:20.708
Of course, honey. Let's see...

01:24.750 --> 01:26.083
Momo?

01:26.166 --> 01:27.708
What are you doing here?

01:33.416 --> 01:34.500
Momo?

01:37.125 --> 01:38.000
Wait!

01:38.750 --> 01:40.875
Where are you going? Momo!

01:43.041 --> 01:44.083
Momo!

01:45.666 --> 01:48.208
Stop!

01:54.333 --> 01:55.333
Momo!

01:57.791 --> 01:59.166
Open this door!

02:00.125 --> 02:01.291
Momo! Open up!

02:01.833 --> 02:02.666
Momo!

02:02.750 --> 02:06.625
Some say that everything is written
and you can't change anything.

02:06.708 --> 02:07.541
Open up!

02:08.041 --> 02:09.916
I want to change everything.

02:10.541 --> 02:14.125
I want to go back to the beginning,
when nothing was written.

02:16.458 --> 02:22.416
THE LIFE AHEAD

02:55.166 --> 02:57.041
Can we go look over there?

02:57.125 --> 02:59.166
Yes, but don't wander off.

03:18.583 --> 03:19.666
Hey!

03:21.000 --> 03:22.125
Hey! Come back!

03:23.375 --> 03:26.750
-Are you hurt, madam?
-That little shit!

04:05.208 --> 04:06.291
See you there.

04:06.375 --> 04:08.916
-Wow, so cool!
-Talk to you later.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.958
-Is it new?
-Hands off!

04:11.500 --> 04:13.375
-What do you want?
-I wanna see Ruspa.

04:13.458 --> 04:15.583
-Why?
-I have a deal for him.

04:15.666 --> 04:17.750
-Sure, a deal...
-Yes, a deal!

04:18.375 --> 04:21.458
Look! These are worth a shitload.
They're antiques.

04:23.666 --> 04:24.750
It's crap.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.666
Go play with your PlayStation.

04:28.583 --> 04:30.250
Ruspa!

04:30.333 --> 04:32.791
-I said he's not here.
-Piss off.

04:32.875 --> 04:35.333
-You wanna get hurt?
-Let me go!

04:35.416 --> 04:37.541
When I say no, I mean no!

04:44.208 --> 04:46.208
Get lost, dipshit.

04:48.625 --> 04:50.250
Don't come back.

04:54.250 --> 04:55.708
Leave. No, my bike!

04:55.791 --> 04:58.000
You son of... Asshole!

04:59.250 --> 05:03.916
I'm 12. My name's Mohamed,
but people call me Momo.

05:06.541 --> 05:11.750
I'm an orphan. When I was little,
Social Services put me in Dr. Coen's care.

05:12.666 --> 05:15.250
He practiced from home
and it was always full of patients.

05:15.916 --> 05:18.958
He always thought
I should behave like other kids

05:19.041 --> 05:21.083
so I wouldn't turn out bad.

05:22.666 --> 05:24.875
But I don't want to be
like the other kids.

05:24.958 --> 05:28.083
Momo, where have you been?
I looked for you everywhere.

05:30.708 --> 05:32.083
What are those?

05:32.666 --> 05:33.500
I won them.

05:35.583 --> 05:38.166
Lucky day. You won this too.

05:39.958 --> 05:41.291
I fell off a bike.

05:41.916 --> 05:45.041
I'll ask you one last time.
Whose are those?

05:46.916 --> 05:47.750
Dunno.

05:52.708 --> 05:55.541
I don't want stolen stuff in my house.

05:56.458 --> 05:58.666
If your memory doesn't come back...

06:00.625 --> 06:03.000
I'll have to report you.

06:05.333 --> 06:08.833
I could've paid a month's rent
with those candlesticks. Got it?

06:09.416 --> 06:11.416
Forty years on the streets,

06:11.500 --> 06:15.041
never had anyone beat me up
or refuse to pay me. Never!

06:15.625 --> 06:17.291
Then you get to my age...

06:19.000 --> 06:20.833
and you get screwed by a little brat.

06:21.333 --> 06:22.333
That's bullshit!

06:24.208 --> 06:25.958
What's so funny, Babu?

06:27.041 --> 06:29.000
What shall we sell to pay the rent?

06:30.125 --> 06:32.625
Hold on. You're hungry, right?

06:33.625 --> 06:36.000
Want a cookie? Here, love.

06:37.375 --> 06:38.541
Here.

06:41.750 --> 06:43.375
Who the hell is that at this hour?

06:43.916 --> 06:46.333
Iosif, get the door.

06:46.833 --> 06:47.666
Okay.

06:49.791 --> 06:52.958
Remember to ask who it is
before you open the door.

06:53.875 --> 06:55.583
Hold on, I'm coming.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.791
Madame Rosa, it's Dr. Coen.

06:58.875 --> 07:02.208
-Dr. Coen, at this hour?
-Yes, him.

07:03.291 --> 07:04.541
-Rosa.
-Hi.

07:05.041 --> 07:08.125
Don't be worried.
No, I have good news.

07:08.625 --> 07:10.375
I brought you a gift.

07:11.083 --> 07:14.333
-Where did you find them?
-The thief has come to apologize.

07:14.416 --> 07:15.625
Right, Momo?

07:17.708 --> 07:21.041
You made me fall.
If I'd gotten my hands on you...

07:22.208 --> 07:23.666
Here, go to Babu.

07:24.166 --> 07:25.166
It's your turn.

07:29.166 --> 07:30.791
Sorry.

07:30.875 --> 07:32.208
Speak up!

07:34.375 --> 07:35.666
Sorry!

07:36.666 --> 07:38.250
"Sorry, Madame..."

07:38.333 --> 07:40.125
How would I know your name?

07:40.208 --> 07:43.416
The kids have always called me
"Madame Rosa."

07:44.875 --> 07:47.250
I apologize, Madame Rosa.

07:47.333 --> 07:48.791
Apology not accepted.

07:50.041 --> 07:53.083
Thanks for the candlesticks.
How can I repay you?

07:53.791 --> 07:55.250
I need a favor.

07:56.250 --> 07:57.250
Well, let's hear it.

07:57.916 --> 08:00.416
Are you nuts? Over my dead body!

08:00.500 --> 08:03.041
-Just for a short time, a few weeks.
-No.

08:03.125 --> 08:05.083
A month, at most.

08:05.166 --> 08:06.500
Out of the question.

08:06.583 --> 08:08.916
Until I find him a proper home.

08:09.000 --> 08:12.583
Hold on, you're his guardian.
What does this have to do with me?

08:14.500 --> 08:17.750
I think he'd be better off here,
with you.

08:17.833 --> 08:19.458
Seriously? Why?

08:19.958 --> 08:22.500
That boy needs a female figure.

08:23.125 --> 08:27.625
Someone tough, who commands respect.
Like you.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.625
I can't keep up.

08:30.125 --> 08:31.041
I'm old.

08:31.125 --> 08:33.250
And I'm a teenager, right?

08:33.916 --> 08:35.250
You're my doctor.

08:35.333 --> 08:38.208
You know about
my heart condition and my pain.

08:38.291 --> 08:41.375
-I'll say it again, just until…
-No!

08:43.708 --> 08:46.708
Momo isn't who you think he is.

08:46.791 --> 08:47.875
I know him well.

08:47.958 --> 08:50.750
He was placed with me
right after the tragedy.

08:50.833 --> 08:54.958
I tried, but couldn't find
anyone willing to adopt him.

08:55.541 --> 08:56.875
"The tragedy"?

08:58.416 --> 08:59.750
Go to the living room.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.708
I'll be right there.

09:36.791 --> 09:39.625
No way. I'm done.

09:40.208 --> 09:42.791
No more hookers' kids
running around my house.

09:43.291 --> 09:47.166
I've looked after too many
and risked a lot over the years.

09:47.875 --> 09:50.500
But street walkers
always help each other out.

09:51.000 --> 09:53.416
Better me than Social Services.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.250
That's why I'm asking you!

09:56.041 --> 09:57.500
Help me out.

09:57.583 --> 09:59.958
But you're not a hooker.

10:00.625 --> 10:02.208
I made myself clear. I'm done.

10:02.291 --> 10:05.125
-What about Iosif?
-Forget it.

10:05.208 --> 10:09.875
He was only supposed to stay a week,
but his mother took off.

10:10.458 --> 10:13.625
Luckily, though,
she sends money regularly.

10:13.708 --> 10:17.083
-If it's a matter of money…
-No, drop it.

10:17.166 --> 10:20.500
I love you, and I'm grateful
you retrieved my candlesticks.

10:20.583 --> 10:24.208
I can pay the rent,
but now it's time for you to go.

10:24.750 --> 10:27.166
Will 600 euros a month do?

10:27.958 --> 10:30.458
I still have some savings left.

10:31.333 --> 10:32.166
Go.

10:38.625 --> 10:39.458
Hey.

10:40.833 --> 10:41.666
Hey!

10:43.208 --> 10:45.125
You forgot your thief!

10:45.208 --> 10:46.125
700 euros.

10:46.208 --> 10:47.500
750 euros.

10:48.458 --> 10:50.625
Two months and not a day more.

10:53.916 --> 10:56.791
-I'm not staying with that whore!
-Don't you dare!

10:57.291 --> 11:00.375
-Rosa's a good woman.
-Then you live with her!

11:00.458 --> 11:03.708
Momo, it's either her
or back to Social Services.

11:03.791 --> 11:05.208
I don't give a shit.

11:05.875 --> 11:07.500
Social Services!

11:08.166 --> 11:10.791
Here I come!

11:20.166 --> 11:21.833
Hey, smart-ass!

11:21.916 --> 11:25.583
If you'd talked to me that way,
I would've punched your teeth in.

11:25.666 --> 11:29.083
I was sitting in the café
and I overheard you.

11:29.166 --> 11:32.916
I wouldn't talk to you that way,
especially because you give me work.

11:38.750 --> 11:40.666
It wouldn't be so bad living with her.

11:42.166 --> 11:44.416
No more Social Services
on your back.

11:45.125 --> 11:48.541
And it would be useful
for business too.

11:51.375 --> 11:52.875
Do you get what I mean?

12:00.625 --> 12:03.625
When the old lady
stopped streetwalking,

12:03.708 --> 12:08.458
she started looking after
other hookers' kids to make some money.

12:09.333 --> 12:11.041
She raised lots of kids.

12:11.125 --> 12:15.166
One even went on to become police chief.
He protected her.

12:17.458 --> 12:20.500
In the neighborhood,
they called this place "a refuge."

12:21.083 --> 12:22.083
I called it...

12:23.208 --> 12:24.458
"a shithole."

12:25.791 --> 12:27.833
He'll behave properly.

12:28.500 --> 12:31.625
He just needs some discipline
and affection.

12:32.250 --> 12:35.958
Okay, Doctor.
Now get lost before I change my mind.

13:05.333 --> 13:06.625
Get off, please.

13:13.333 --> 13:14.791
Get off my bed!

13:25.000 --> 13:26.833
-Leave me alone.
-Get off!

13:27.500 --> 13:28.500
Stop it!

13:30.916 --> 13:32.708
Get up. Get up!

13:34.000 --> 13:35.791
No shoes on the bed!

13:36.791 --> 13:40.541
And you, stop messing about
and go study your Hebrew.

13:40.625 --> 13:41.791
I'll test you later.

13:42.458 --> 13:45.166
You, come with me.
I'll set you up somewhere else.

13:55.375 --> 13:56.333
Here it is.

14:02.208 --> 14:03.416
What's this?

14:04.791 --> 14:05.708
Your room.

14:06.333 --> 14:07.416
It's a shithole!

14:08.250 --> 14:11.708
Did you expect a royal palace?
Give me a break!

14:14.166 --> 14:15.375
It's a shithole.

14:20.208 --> 14:21.875
Get off me! Madame!

14:22.625 --> 14:24.500
Enough!

14:24.583 --> 14:27.125
Stop! I said that's enough!

14:27.208 --> 14:29.916
Iosif, to your room.
And you, to your shithole.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.500
For Christ's sake!

14:57.208 --> 14:59.208
I don't even have a picture of my mother,

14:59.875 --> 15:01.916
but I do remember some things
about her.

15:03.541 --> 15:08.500
Her smile when she'd stand me on her feet
and we'd dance.

15:11.166 --> 15:13.583
She loved to dance.

15:15.541 --> 15:17.708
Once, I accidentally made her fall.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.625
But she didn't get upset.

15:24.708 --> 15:29.375
We rolled around on the rug.
She held me in her arms and laughed.

15:30.500 --> 15:32.041
She laughed so much.

15:34.958 --> 15:36.541
She was so beautiful.

15:49.375 --> 15:50.875
Start with these.

15:56.625 --> 16:00.875
Each bag is a dose.

16:02.333 --> 16:03.708
Don't get caught.

16:05.291 --> 16:08.500
And above all, don't ever screw me over.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.166
Follow the rules
and you won't have any "incidents".

16:13.791 --> 16:14.625
Come on.

16:21.791 --> 16:24.500
You gonna hand out the stuff for free?

16:25.041 --> 16:26.458
What about the prices?

16:26.541 --> 16:28.666
Synthetic and natural, 10 euros.

16:28.750 --> 16:30.208
Orange, 60 euros.

16:30.291 --> 16:33.375
Only cash, no meal vouchers. Right?

16:34.708 --> 16:36.166
Smart-ass.

16:36.791 --> 16:37.833
Scram.

19:09.083 --> 19:12.166
-I said "Hashem."
-No, you said "pashem."

19:13.041 --> 19:15.041
Enough, I'm sick of reading.

19:15.125 --> 19:16.666
I don't understand a word.

19:16.750 --> 19:19.791
-I don't want a bar mitzvah anyway.
-Your loss.

19:20.375 --> 19:23.625
But as long as you live here,
you'll follow my rules.

19:23.708 --> 19:24.791
Carry on.

19:24.875 --> 19:26.458
Honey, it's me.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.541
-Hi!
-Look what I have.

19:28.625 --> 19:31.458
Eyeliner, eye shadow, lipstick.

19:31.541 --> 19:33.041
-Almost new.
-How nice!

19:33.125 --> 19:35.125
-I cleaned out my cabinet.
-I love it.

19:35.208 --> 19:38.250
You have all sorts of samples.
Lotions, perfumes...

19:38.333 --> 19:39.958
My drawers are full of this stuff.

19:41.250 --> 19:42.458
Go get Babu.

19:42.958 --> 19:44.000
Who's he?

19:46.458 --> 19:48.875
Hi, I'm Lola.

19:49.708 --> 19:50.625
Momo.

19:51.875 --> 19:52.750
"Momo"?

19:54.416 --> 19:55.333
Adorable.

19:56.041 --> 19:57.500
Oh, sure he is.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.458
Want to trade?

20:00.041 --> 20:02.375
I'll keep Babu and you take him.

20:03.666 --> 20:06.125
My baby! Hello, my love!

20:06.208 --> 20:07.583
Come to Mommy!

20:08.791 --> 20:10.000
Did we sleep well?

20:11.166 --> 20:13.541
You and I will have fun today, all right?

20:14.833 --> 20:16.125
How do you do it?

20:16.208 --> 20:19.041
Acrobatics at night
and mother during the day.

20:19.125 --> 20:21.625
I have to prove to his...

20:22.125 --> 20:25.541
bitch of a mother
that we can get by just fine without her.

20:34.916 --> 20:37.166
What are you doing?

20:37.250 --> 20:40.208
-Not today.
-Come on, honey. Come!

20:40.291 --> 20:43.541
Let's dance!
A little exercise is good for the heart.

20:43.625 --> 20:45.291
Not today, I'm not in the mood.

20:45.375 --> 20:48.458
You're always doing this but I can't.
I'm not up to it.

20:48.541 --> 20:50.625
Come. Yeah!

20:54.833 --> 20:58.208
-There she goes!
-Yeah, here I go...

21:07.916 --> 21:09.000
Look, look! Good!

21:56.041 --> 21:57.083
No!

21:57.166 --> 22:00.083
Give me that. I need it for work.

22:00.166 --> 22:01.333
Please!

22:03.541 --> 22:04.375
No!

22:25.125 --> 22:27.125
Why isn't Iosif helping out?

22:27.208 --> 22:29.291
Because he dried the dishes yesterday.

22:30.000 --> 22:31.333
Today it's your turn.

22:42.666 --> 22:43.500
Here.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.583
What are you doing? Be careful!

22:47.875 --> 22:48.833
Okay...

22:50.041 --> 22:53.791
It's too hot. Get lost.
Go play with the others.

23:06.833 --> 23:07.833
Pass it!

23:13.083 --> 23:14.791
What's that number on her arm?

23:15.583 --> 23:17.375
-Who?
-The bitch.

23:17.458 --> 23:18.625
It's a code.

23:19.500 --> 23:20.666
A code for what?

23:21.333 --> 23:22.708
It's a cover.

23:22.791 --> 23:26.166
She pretends to have a bad back,
aches and pains,

23:26.250 --> 23:28.333
but she's actually a secret agent.

23:28.416 --> 23:29.625
Counterespionage.

23:29.708 --> 23:31.791
I think her HQ is in the building.

23:31.875 --> 23:34.000
She uses the code to get in.

23:34.541 --> 23:35.666
Is this true?

23:35.750 --> 23:39.750
I swear, I saw her go down there at night.
Down in the basement.

23:41.208 --> 23:43.083
It's like a Batcave.

23:47.875 --> 23:50.166
-Where are you going?
-Get lost.

24:59.833 --> 25:02.208
Madame Rosa, I found him.

25:03.166 --> 25:06.000
You talk, I slit your throat.

25:07.375 --> 25:08.625
Where have you been?

25:11.125 --> 25:12.250
Come with me.

25:18.791 --> 25:20.625
-Where are we going?
-Move it.

25:23.875 --> 25:27.916
Hamil, it's getting harder and harder
to raise kids in this neighborhood.

25:28.000 --> 25:28.833
Indeed.

25:28.916 --> 25:32.625
But I couldn't say no to a friend
like Dr. Coen.

25:33.708 --> 25:36.916
-Have some. Fresh from Algeria.
-No, thanks.

25:37.458 --> 25:40.291
Momo! Come here. Want one?

25:41.375 --> 25:43.791
-They make me gag.
-No...

25:44.958 --> 25:48.500
I was thinking that the boy
could give you a hand now and then.

25:48.583 --> 25:52.166
Just to keep him busy during the summer.

25:52.250 --> 25:54.541
Business hasn't been great recently.

25:54.625 --> 25:58.291
All I'm asking is to have him
a few times a week,

25:58.375 --> 26:00.166
not every day.

26:00.250 --> 26:02.250
And only if you hit it off.

26:03.166 --> 26:04.166
Right.

26:05.041 --> 26:06.000
Where are you from?

26:10.166 --> 26:12.583
He's Senegalese Muslim.

26:14.958 --> 26:16.291
Do you go to mosque?

26:18.750 --> 26:21.583
That's how he is. He needs guidance.

26:22.166 --> 26:25.333
It would be good for Momo
to spend some time with you.

26:26.916 --> 26:27.791
Mr. Hamil,

26:27.875 --> 26:32.166
you're the most respectable man
I've ever met.

26:33.166 --> 26:34.291
Madame Rosa...

26:35.791 --> 26:38.791
your eyes and voice
still sing the song of deceit.

26:38.875 --> 26:40.375
Deceit? Nonsense!

26:40.458 --> 26:43.041
And if the boy works hard,

26:43.125 --> 26:46.208
you can give us something small in return.

26:48.416 --> 26:49.791
How much would you suggest?

26:50.375 --> 26:52.375
Good heavens, you decide!

26:52.458 --> 26:53.833
What do I know?

26:56.583 --> 26:58.500
Come see me on Monday, okay?

27:33.583 --> 27:34.500
Nala!

27:44.791 --> 27:47.041
From now on,
the Libertà neighborhood is his.

27:47.666 --> 27:48.791
What?

27:48.875 --> 27:51.208
He made more in a week
than you do in a month.

27:51.291 --> 27:54.083
I've busted my ass for years,
now this damn kid…

27:54.166 --> 27:55.083
Hey! So what?

27:56.416 --> 28:00.291
Once you pull in as much as him,
I'll reconsider.

28:00.375 --> 28:02.208
Now give me the phone and get lost.

28:11.541 --> 28:13.166
This is not for playing games.

28:13.750 --> 28:14.958
It's for work.

28:16.125 --> 28:18.791
All of our clients' numbers are in here.

28:20.125 --> 28:21.375
I'm counting on you.

28:21.958 --> 28:22.958
Yes, sir.

28:59.916 --> 29:00.875
Piece of shit!

29:38.208 --> 29:39.625
Momo, come here!

29:40.708 --> 29:41.958
What's with the shouting?

29:42.041 --> 29:43.041
Hurry!

29:52.375 --> 29:53.291
Come on!

29:54.708 --> 29:55.791
Move it!

29:55.875 --> 29:57.208
What's the matter?

29:57.291 --> 29:59.416
Look! Look.

30:00.750 --> 30:03.250
-What's she doing?
-Dunno. I found her like this.

30:03.333 --> 30:04.375
Like a mummy.

30:10.250 --> 30:11.250
Hey!

30:12.708 --> 30:13.916
Is anybody in there?

30:20.041 --> 30:21.375
What are you doing?

30:38.833 --> 30:40.000
Do it with me.

30:51.875 --> 30:54.708
Are you nuts?
What are you doing?

30:55.291 --> 30:56.916
Can't you see it's raining?

30:57.000 --> 30:58.541
You're the one who can't see it.

30:59.791 --> 31:01.958
Of course I do. Are you dumb?

31:02.583 --> 31:04.500
Inside, now!

31:16.916 --> 31:18.458
You're late.

31:18.541 --> 31:21.541
Grab that box of lighters
and stack them there.

31:35.083 --> 31:36.666
What part of Senegal are you from,
Mohamed?

31:38.166 --> 31:40.750
Don't call me Mohamed. My name's Momo.

31:42.708 --> 31:44.833
What's wrong with Mohamed?
It's a lovely name.

31:44.916 --> 31:47.750
I don't like it. It's long.

31:47.833 --> 31:49.291
As you wish.

31:55.208 --> 31:56.625
I'm from Diourbel.

31:57.583 --> 31:58.916
Near Dakar.

32:00.083 --> 32:01.666
Is it a big city?

32:02.750 --> 32:03.833
Dunno.

32:04.708 --> 32:07.000
I left when I was a baby.

32:17.666 --> 32:19.125
Hey, come here.

32:19.208 --> 32:20.041
Come.

32:27.625 --> 32:30.458
When I started,
I only sold rugs and antique books.

32:31.833 --> 32:33.625
I even had two employees.

32:35.916 --> 32:37.791
Now all I sell is plastic.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.583
Come here. Give me a hand.

32:42.583 --> 32:43.541
Grab this.

32:55.458 --> 32:56.666
Beautiful, isn't it?

32:57.875 --> 32:59.958
Beautiful and full of history.

33:01.166 --> 33:04.625
I've been meaning to get it repaired
but never got around to it.

33:04.708 --> 33:06.625
Now you're here, you can help.

33:09.583 --> 33:10.583
Come here.

33:13.791 --> 33:18.666
In the Qur'an, the lion is a symbol
of power, patience and faith.

33:20.500 --> 33:21.916
Do you have faith?

33:25.041 --> 33:29.000
Faith is like love.
Every Muslim must always remember this.

33:33.791 --> 33:36.125
I didn't even know I was Muslim.

33:36.916 --> 33:39.416
I found out when I used to go to school.

33:39.500 --> 33:41.041
Used to?

33:41.125 --> 33:42.625
I got kicked out.

33:42.708 --> 33:43.666
Why?

33:44.250 --> 33:47.416
I stabbed a bully in the neck
with a pencil.

33:52.208 --> 33:53.791
Momo...

33:53.875 --> 33:54.916
Language...

33:55.666 --> 33:58.083
Language is the greatest weapon.

33:58.166 --> 34:00.708
There's no need to stick a pencil
in someone's neck.

34:03.166 --> 34:04.916
I do it my way.

35:26.708 --> 35:28.833
Momo, what are you doing?

35:31.625 --> 35:34.083
The racket you're making woke us all up.

35:34.916 --> 35:36.583
Babu got scared.

35:37.125 --> 35:39.875
Babu, it was just a lioness.

35:39.958 --> 35:41.708
Lioness? Are you high?

35:41.791 --> 35:44.458
-What the hell are you saying!
-Madame, he's on drugs!

35:45.458 --> 35:47.041
Don't you dare.

35:47.625 --> 35:49.000
Don't you dare!

35:50.416 --> 35:52.041
It's your lioness.

35:52.125 --> 35:54.166
The one I know about, right?

35:55.583 --> 35:56.458
Yes.

35:57.958 --> 36:00.083
But now she only comes to visit you?

36:02.916 --> 36:06.208
You don't tell others that she's come
to maul them anymore?

36:07.375 --> 36:09.541
No, I'm not an idiot.

36:11.916 --> 36:13.916
And you play together.

36:15.833 --> 36:17.625
She licks my face.

36:18.333 --> 36:20.250
-She looks after me.
-Are you kidding?

36:20.333 --> 36:22.041
He's out of his mind.

36:22.875 --> 36:25.916
Momo, can you please step outside?

36:34.625 --> 36:37.416
I come here to tell you
about the trouble he's causing,

36:37.500 --> 36:38.958
and what do you do?

36:39.041 --> 36:40.708
You go along with it?

36:40.791 --> 36:42.625
This is nuts!

36:43.166 --> 36:46.791
-Calm down and listen.
-No, you listen to me.

36:46.875 --> 36:51.125
You keep saying that with my bad heart,
I need to stay calm and relaxed.

36:51.208 --> 36:53.500
Then you put that hooligan in my house?

36:53.583 --> 36:55.791
Rosa, he's a child.

36:55.875 --> 36:58.916
A child? He's not normal.

36:59.000 --> 37:01.166
He's rotten to the core.

37:01.250 --> 37:03.958
It's not his fault.
He got it from someone.

37:04.041 --> 37:06.750
His mother, his father... Who knows!

37:06.833 --> 37:10.833
One night, he could sneak up on me
and slit my throat,

37:10.916 --> 37:12.208
or hurt one of the kids.

37:12.291 --> 37:15.916
-I know what he's capable of!
-Enough!

37:17.041 --> 37:18.416
Shut up!

37:20.416 --> 37:24.083
How can you say, let alone think that?

37:24.666 --> 37:26.916
With everything you've been through...

37:27.000 --> 37:30.125
I just meant
he has his own way of thinking.

37:30.208 --> 37:32.291
I don't spit on anyone.

37:36.083 --> 37:38.166
You're doing me a huge favor.

37:38.750 --> 37:40.750
I know it's a burden on you.

37:40.833 --> 37:43.250
But please, Rosa...

37:44.041 --> 37:48.041
You're a smart woman.
What are you afraid of? The lioness?

37:48.625 --> 37:52.083
It's just his need
for protection, affection, love.

37:52.166 --> 37:53.583
What do you want me to do?

37:53.666 --> 37:57.625
Lick his face every night
before he goes to bed?

37:58.958 --> 38:01.166
That's all I needed, a lioness...

38:01.250 --> 38:03.041
Thank you.

38:40.375 --> 38:42.041
-Let's go.
-I want to see.

38:42.125 --> 38:45.625
No, there's nothing to see here.
Let's go the other way.

38:45.708 --> 38:47.333
Come on.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.666
You go up. I'll be right there.

40:23.583 --> 40:25.500
What are you doing here?

40:26.333 --> 40:27.458
What do you want?

40:29.125 --> 40:30.500
What is this place?

40:31.291 --> 40:34.958
Get out! Go home! Go!

40:35.875 --> 40:36.833
No.

40:36.916 --> 40:40.583
I don't want anybody in here. Nobody!

40:40.666 --> 40:42.125
Get out!

41:06.375 --> 41:09.083
I loved drawing when I was your age too.

41:17.583 --> 41:18.791
Can I see?

41:31.916 --> 41:33.458
You know, down there...

41:34.541 --> 41:35.875
I feel safe.

41:41.083 --> 41:42.208
Why?

41:46.958 --> 41:48.291
Just because.

42:04.750 --> 42:06.875
You can stay as long as you want.

42:08.083 --> 42:10.541
You can sleep in Iosif's room,

42:11.083 --> 42:12.500
so you have more space.

42:13.541 --> 42:14.750
If you want.

42:46.125 --> 42:48.083
Knock it off! I wanna sleep.

42:53.625 --> 42:56.708
Stop it, I said! You'll wake up Babu.

42:58.083 --> 42:59.000
Hey.

43:01.166 --> 43:04.166
-What's wrong?
-Nothing. Don't pretend you give a shit.

43:04.791 --> 43:08.083
-Tell me before I beat you up.
-I miss my mother.

43:09.875 --> 43:11.333
Forget about it.

43:11.875 --> 43:13.250
I want her.

43:15.125 --> 43:18.208
But she doesn't want you.
She abandoned you.

43:18.291 --> 43:20.291
That's not true. She'll be back.

43:21.208 --> 43:24.750
Why are you such an asshole?
Don't you miss your mother?

43:29.333 --> 43:32.208
My mother didn't abandon me.

43:32.875 --> 43:34.083
She died.

43:35.125 --> 43:39.166
She wanted to quit being a hooker
and my dad lost it on her.

43:39.916 --> 43:41.333
I was six.

43:42.875 --> 43:45.708
I had the best years of my life with her.

43:45.791 --> 43:48.208
See? We're the same.

43:48.291 --> 43:50.125
You miss her too.

43:50.208 --> 43:53.958
No, we're not the same. Not at all.

43:55.125 --> 43:58.625
Now sleep. Or I'll kick your ass.

44:20.666 --> 44:22.916
Come on. Try it, chickenshit.

44:23.500 --> 44:26.083
I'm no chickenshit.
I just prefer cooked fish.

44:26.166 --> 44:28.250
Cooked fish loses all its flavor.

44:28.333 --> 44:29.583
Be a man!

44:38.541 --> 44:39.625
Good, right?

44:47.750 --> 44:48.625
Here.

44:50.375 --> 44:53.958
For the first two months. Enjoy yourself.

45:03.000 --> 45:04.125
Thank you.

45:06.291 --> 45:07.375
Come here.

45:15.916 --> 45:18.875
Do you like it? It's yours.

45:42.916 --> 45:46.000
I'm young,
and I've got my whole life ahead of me.

45:46.083 --> 45:47.083
I know that.

45:48.333 --> 45:51.375
I'm not going to bust my ass
for happiness.

45:51.458 --> 45:54.000
If it shows up, great.

45:54.083 --> 45:56.916
If not, who gives a shit?

45:57.000 --> 45:59.125
We're like chalk and cheese.

46:16.750 --> 46:18.458
Careful, guys.

46:18.541 --> 46:21.083
Yes. Catch me.

46:21.166 --> 46:22.000
Catch me!

46:24.958 --> 46:26.541
What on earth are you smoking?

46:26.625 --> 46:28.916
-Strawberry flavor.
-Strawberry?

46:29.000 --> 46:32.000
-Don't you like it?
-Blow it the other way.

46:32.083 --> 46:33.500
It's disgusting. Strawberry?

46:34.083 --> 46:36.916
Smoke should smell like tobacco,
not fruit salad.

46:37.000 --> 46:38.916
I'll never be able to quit.

46:39.000 --> 46:40.875
Because you don't have discipline.

46:40.958 --> 46:43.166
Never have. Never.

46:44.041 --> 46:45.750
Where are you going?

46:45.833 --> 46:47.000
To the bathroom.

46:48.500 --> 46:50.625
Lola lived downstairs from us.

46:51.666 --> 46:54.875
As a man, she had been a middleweight
boxing champion.

46:55.416 --> 46:57.541
People respected her in the neighborhood,

46:57.625 --> 47:01.041
because if they didn't,
she'd bash their faces in.

47:04.791 --> 47:05.875
What is it?

47:07.666 --> 47:10.666
My father remembered my birthday.

47:10.750 --> 47:13.083
-That's good, right?
-No.

47:13.166 --> 47:17.041
I know it's just an excuse.
He wants to meet Babu.

47:17.125 --> 47:19.541
He wants his grandson, not his daughter.

47:19.625 --> 47:22.083
Like hell we're going to Galicia.

47:22.166 --> 47:24.125
When is she coming back?

47:24.833 --> 47:26.541
I'll go check on her.

47:29.083 --> 47:30.541
The two of us versus Momo.

47:31.083 --> 47:33.750
Watch out. I'm going to catch you.
Got you.

47:33.833 --> 47:37.041
Come on, catch us!
You can't. We're too fast.

47:39.291 --> 47:42.375
Momo, I can't find her. Come with me.

47:50.041 --> 47:51.875
You go that way, I'll go this way.

47:53.166 --> 47:54.500
Honey?

47:56.416 --> 47:57.750
Honey?

48:06.666 --> 48:08.125
Where is she?

48:13.000 --> 48:14.250
Honey?

48:18.875 --> 48:20.458
Madame Rosa?

48:30.250 --> 48:31.333
Honey?

48:35.791 --> 48:37.375
Madame Rosa?

48:50.000 --> 48:51.250
Madame Rosa!

48:55.708 --> 48:57.750
Madame Rosa, can you hear me?

48:59.458 --> 49:01.791
Hey, what are you doing here?

49:02.375 --> 49:03.458
Look what I found.

49:03.541 --> 49:07.208
-My shoes. Yes, give me those.
-Honey?

49:07.708 --> 49:08.750
Honey?

49:08.833 --> 49:11.958
Where were you? You just disappeared.

49:12.041 --> 49:13.750
What...

49:15.500 --> 49:18.625
It's so hot, she just wanted
some fresh air. Right?

49:18.708 --> 49:20.916
Of course. That's right.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.708
It's true.

49:22.791 --> 49:24.541
Next time tell me, though.

49:26.166 --> 49:28.375
You scared us.

49:28.458 --> 49:30.000
Sorry.

49:30.083 --> 49:32.208
We better go. It's late.

49:56.375 --> 49:58.250
You're pretty good.

49:59.291 --> 50:02.333
I'm usually good at things I can't stand.

50:03.708 --> 50:07.250
-Then you'll do well in school.
-Except for that.

50:09.458 --> 50:11.750
Were you ever married, Mr. Hamil?

50:12.416 --> 50:13.541
Sure.

50:14.333 --> 50:16.333
I had a beautiful wife.

50:17.000 --> 50:20.041
-And where is she?
-In heaven.

50:21.166 --> 50:22.583
God rest her soul.

50:23.708 --> 50:25.250
Don't you feel lonely?

50:26.333 --> 50:28.500
Well, I've got my rugs and my books.

50:29.458 --> 50:31.541
You can't hug books and rugs.

50:35.625 --> 50:37.000
What's your point?

50:37.875 --> 50:42.791
You are old and single.
Madame Rosa is old and single, so...

50:47.750 --> 50:50.666
Are you trying to set us up?

50:51.291 --> 50:54.208
Why not?
Bring her here and kiss her a little.

50:55.041 --> 50:56.750
That way she'll get off my back.

50:58.291 --> 50:59.833
How generous of you.

51:01.250 --> 51:04.000
The problem is
that I could never marry a Jew.

51:04.083 --> 51:07.333
Madame Rosa isn't Jewish anymore.
She's just old.

51:08.125 --> 51:11.666
Even old folks are too selfish
to manage to live together.

51:15.291 --> 51:17.375
Fine. I tried.

51:18.666 --> 51:20.541
And I appreciate the effort.

51:55.125 --> 51:56.750
Madame Rosa?

52:06.083 --> 52:09.083
-Madame Rosa!
-Stairs! They're on the stairs!

52:09.166 --> 52:10.291
Who?

52:13.625 --> 52:15.916
-Madame Rosa, open the door.
-Go away.

52:16.000 --> 52:18.833
-Let me in.
-Get the suitcase.

52:22.083 --> 52:24.666
Go get Lola! Hurry!
Madame!

52:25.708 --> 52:27.458
Quiet!

52:33.041 --> 52:34.500
Momo, what's going on?

52:34.583 --> 52:36.750
She's won't answer or open the door.

52:39.000 --> 52:41.916
Honey? Honey, open the door.

52:43.250 --> 52:45.041
What are you doing in there?

52:48.250 --> 52:50.416
-The stairs.
-Honey?

52:50.916 --> 52:53.666
-The stairs...
-What's going on, honey?

52:54.375 --> 52:56.916
-The stairs...
-No, relax.

52:57.000 --> 52:59.500
It's okay. Don't worry, it's me.

53:00.583 --> 53:02.750
-The stairs...
-Momo.

53:04.500 --> 53:07.166
-Momo, call Dr. Coen.
-Okay.

53:31.541 --> 53:32.958
Rosa's feeling better.

53:34.208 --> 53:36.291
She's calm and lucid again.

53:37.166 --> 53:38.291
What's wrong with her?

53:39.000 --> 53:41.791
I don't know.
It could be a number of things.

53:43.791 --> 53:44.958
She's tired.

53:46.125 --> 53:48.458
I need to schedule a CAT scan for her.

53:49.916 --> 53:53.291
To check her health.
The blood, the oxygen...

53:54.333 --> 53:56.166
They aren't flowing properly.

54:01.375 --> 54:02.416
And then...

54:04.708 --> 54:06.125
I have to take care of you.

54:07.458 --> 54:10.375
Me? I like being here now.

54:24.208 --> 54:25.791
Do you think she'll get better?

54:29.333 --> 54:30.416
I don't know.

54:32.291 --> 54:33.958
Maybe we should pray.

54:40.333 --> 54:41.333
I'll pray.

54:45.250 --> 54:47.875
You pray, I'll go check on her.

55:12.250 --> 55:15.000
Madame Rosa, what are you doing down here?

55:17.500 --> 55:19.250
Go back to bed. It's cold.

55:20.916 --> 55:24.666
No, I'm fine here.
Don't worry.

55:26.375 --> 55:28.625
I didn't feel like being in bed anymore.

55:30.416 --> 55:33.583
When I'm down here,
I can think, I can reflect...

55:37.791 --> 55:40.291
Iosif says this is your Batcave.

55:43.291 --> 55:45.416
He's got a point.

55:50.666 --> 55:53.583
In Auschwitz, I would hide
under the barracks.

55:54.708 --> 55:56.375
It was my refuge.

55:56.458 --> 55:59.333
Just like down here. I was your age.

55:59.833 --> 56:00.916
Housewitch?

56:01.458 --> 56:04.000
That name means nothing to you.

56:04.833 --> 56:06.041
Just as well.

56:06.750 --> 56:08.916
Don't pay attention to what I'm saying.

56:09.916 --> 56:11.500
I'm an old lady now.

56:18.958 --> 56:20.500
Come here.

56:25.083 --> 56:27.500
I bought it at a market a long time ago.

56:28.208 --> 56:30.083
These are mimosas, see?

56:31.833 --> 56:38.166
Before the war, my parents rented a house
with a yard like this, near Viareggio.

56:39.166 --> 56:43.291
In the spring, the mimosa trees
exploded with yellow flowers.

56:43.916 --> 56:46.250
They were so beautiful, it made me cry.

56:47.541 --> 56:50.833
I would give up all of my memories
just to keep this one.

56:54.708 --> 56:59.958
Momo, no matter what happens,
I don't want to end up in a hospital.

57:01.000 --> 57:04.666
I'm telling you
because although you're tough,

57:04.750 --> 57:06.875
sometimes even a little shit,

57:07.666 --> 57:09.333
I know you keep your word.

57:10.250 --> 57:12.625
-Not even if it's necessary?
-No!

57:12.708 --> 57:14.250
I know what doctors are like.

57:14.791 --> 57:19.958
They torture you
so they can pat themselves on the back.

57:20.541 --> 57:23.958
They experiment on you, trust me.
I've been there.

57:24.708 --> 57:26.916
I don't want to go through it again.

57:28.000 --> 57:29.375
Promise me.

57:31.500 --> 57:32.458
I promise.

57:33.416 --> 57:35.583
Say it in Hebrew. It's better.

57:36.833 --> 57:37.833
Herem.

57:39.083 --> 57:40.041
Herem.

57:57.083 --> 57:58.750
I wish I could go to school too.

57:59.416 --> 58:01.916
But Madame Rosa said
I'd get caught straight away.

58:02.750 --> 58:04.333
Because I'm undocumented.

58:05.625 --> 58:06.583
Lucky you.

58:08.125 --> 58:10.791
-Is she sleeping?
-I don't know.

58:23.541 --> 58:27.708
The more time passed,
the more ups and downs Madame Rosa had.

58:28.875 --> 58:30.916
Some days, she'd stay lucid,

58:31.000 --> 58:35.583
and she would be able to cook
Jewish-style carp without messing up.

58:36.708 --> 58:38.833
On other days,

58:38.916 --> 58:42.208
she withdrew into her own world
and would stop talking.

58:44.583 --> 58:47.708
Meanwhile, I'd use this time
to get myself new clients.

1:00:03.625 --> 1:00:04.625
I'm leaving.

1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:10.208
See you.

1:00:15.541 --> 1:00:17.250
How does that tune go?

1:00:17.333 --> 1:00:19.750
Babu can play it good. I can't.

1:00:30.083 --> 1:00:31.291
I'll miss you.

1:00:34.666 --> 1:00:35.750
I won't.

1:00:36.458 --> 1:00:38.375
I finally have the room to myself.

1:00:50.208 --> 1:00:52.250
I told you she'd be back.

1:01:44.541 --> 1:01:45.916
I will miss him too.

1:01:47.833 --> 1:01:49.875
But we have to be happy for him.

1:01:52.208 --> 1:01:54.333
It's when you give up on hope...

1:01:55.458 --> 1:01:57.375
that good things happen.

1:01:59.875 --> 1:02:01.291
It's comforting.

1:02:51.333 --> 1:02:54.000
Don't blame the AC for this hellish heat.

1:02:55.666 --> 1:02:56.666
Careful!

1:03:08.916 --> 1:03:10.833
I told you about Les Misérables, didn't I?

1:03:12.625 --> 1:03:18.083
How Victor Hugo teaches us
that everything is relative.

1:03:18.833 --> 1:03:20.583
Especially good and evil.

1:03:21.250 --> 1:03:24.708
It depends on the people you meet
and how you listen to them.

1:03:27.916 --> 1:03:32.333
Momo, I know what you do at school
and around the neighborhood.

1:03:32.916 --> 1:03:34.291
What are you talking about?

1:03:34.791 --> 1:03:37.791
I know the people you hang out with
and the guy you work for.

1:03:38.916 --> 1:03:41.333
I know you think they're your family now,

1:03:41.416 --> 1:03:44.291
and that it's the best option
for the life ahead of you.

1:03:44.375 --> 1:03:45.333
But it's not.

1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:47.083
You gonna turn me in?

1:03:48.333 --> 1:03:49.458
Absolutely not.

1:03:50.208 --> 1:03:52.750
That wouldn't change you.
On the contrary.

1:03:52.833 --> 1:03:54.875
I want you to take responsibility.

1:03:54.958 --> 1:03:57.875
What the hell do you want?
You're not my father!

1:03:57.958 --> 1:04:00.041
I don't need anything from you!

1:04:05.416 --> 1:04:07.000
I have important news.

1:04:10.291 --> 1:04:12.666
I decided to accept
my father's invitation.

1:04:13.583 --> 1:04:14.416
Really?

1:04:14.916 --> 1:04:17.708
We're going to Galicia
so he can meet Babu.

1:04:18.791 --> 1:04:20.291
Are you sure?

1:04:23.000 --> 1:04:24.000
Not in the least.

1:04:26.333 --> 1:04:29.500
What did I tell you?
No phone at the table.

1:04:29.583 --> 1:04:32.083
It's not mine. Mine's in the other room.

1:04:35.208 --> 1:04:37.416
Whose phone is it then?

1:04:40.708 --> 1:04:42.250
Where did you steal it from?

1:04:44.833 --> 1:04:47.875
Give it to me. Come on, give it to me.

1:04:49.333 --> 1:04:50.958
I won't give you shit.

1:04:51.666 --> 1:04:52.833
It's my phone.

1:04:55.125 --> 1:04:56.458
How did you get it?

1:04:58.125 --> 1:04:59.875
I earned it by dealing.

1:05:00.958 --> 1:05:03.583
And if you don't like it,
you can piss off.

1:05:04.375 --> 1:05:05.250
Momo!

1:05:06.458 --> 1:05:08.708
-Momo!
-Let him go.

1:05:09.375 --> 1:05:11.375
It's no use.

1:08:04.333 --> 1:08:06.833
I don't know how much time she's got left.

1:08:08.333 --> 1:08:12.291
But I did the only thing I could.

1:08:13.250 --> 1:08:17.458
In the hospital,
Rosa will receive the care she needs.

1:08:17.541 --> 1:08:19.708
She can't stay here.

1:08:20.375 --> 1:08:23.291
She'll lose consciousness
more and more often.

1:08:24.375 --> 1:08:27.166
She needs to be monitored
and looked after,

1:08:27.250 --> 1:08:29.166
for any eventuality. Understand?

1:08:30.333 --> 1:08:31.250
Yes.

1:08:32.458 --> 1:08:33.875
It's the only solution.

1:08:37.333 --> 1:08:38.458
I give up.

1:08:57.250 --> 1:09:01.916
Nature doesn't know what's best.
It does things without rhyme or reason.

1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:06.500
At times, it's flowers and animals,

1:09:07.791 --> 1:09:13.458
and at other times, it's an old lady
they won't let out of the hospital.

1:09:16.916 --> 1:09:19.500
But I had made a promise to Madame Rosa.

1:09:21.666 --> 1:09:23.541
And she had put her trust in me.

1:09:41.333 --> 1:09:42.250
Hi.

1:10:04.750 --> 1:10:05.750
Who are you?

1:10:10.625 --> 1:10:13.458
It's Momo.
Are you doing this on purpose?

1:10:15.500 --> 1:10:17.083
I know you're angry.

1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:27.166
I know what you want.

1:10:27.958 --> 1:10:29.625
I'm not stupid.

1:10:36.250 --> 1:10:38.291
I'll be back. I'll help you.

1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:43.208
But when I come back, you have to help me
because I can't do it alone.

1:10:43.875 --> 1:10:44.875
All right?

1:11:11.791 --> 1:11:13.666
I heard about the old lady.

1:11:16.583 --> 1:11:17.916
Come with me.

1:11:19.291 --> 1:11:21.750
Come on! Let's go!

1:11:22.958 --> 1:11:24.625
That's what friends are for.

1:11:35.583 --> 1:11:37.291
Make yourself at home.

1:11:39.708 --> 1:11:41.000
I was expecting my son.

1:11:44.208 --> 1:11:45.833
It's his birthday.

1:11:45.916 --> 1:11:48.833
I haven't seen him in a month.
I was looking forward to it.

1:11:48.916 --> 1:11:52.166
But his damn mother
never respects the rules.

1:11:52.250 --> 1:11:55.708
First, she makes promises
and then she makes up excuses.

1:11:56.375 --> 1:11:59.333
It was a shitty day for both of us.

1:11:59.416 --> 1:12:01.291
So let's celebrate!

1:12:08.708 --> 1:12:09.708
Sit down.

1:12:13.750 --> 1:12:16.041
Are you asleep? Sit down.

1:12:32.875 --> 1:12:33.833
To us.

1:12:49.083 --> 1:12:51.458
Stop thinking about it. Move on.

1:13:01.541 --> 1:13:02.375
Here.

1:13:10.791 --> 1:13:11.791
Well?

1:13:12.541 --> 1:13:13.791
It's all there.

1:13:23.083 --> 1:13:24.958
I don't get it. Are you quitting?

1:13:48.833 --> 1:13:50.500
Do you know what your problem is?

1:13:53.916 --> 1:13:57.541
You don't think
you deserve the respect you've earned.

1:14:08.666 --> 1:14:10.791
If you leave, then we're done.

1:14:14.500 --> 1:14:15.958
You're done with everyone.

1:14:18.541 --> 1:14:19.750
Is that clear?

1:15:08.375 --> 1:15:09.625
I'm sorry.

1:15:33.666 --> 1:15:34.708
Too much?

1:15:36.166 --> 1:15:39.333
-Papa loves red.
-You're beautiful.

1:15:47.041 --> 1:15:50.208
Momo, you stay with Dr. Coen. Promise?

1:15:50.291 --> 1:15:52.625
-Don't worry.
-Okay.

1:16:38.333 --> 1:16:41.041
GERIATRIC WARD

1:16:51.875 --> 1:16:54.541
I'll get you out of here,
but no fussing.

1:18:35.708 --> 1:18:36.833
I can't...

1:18:37.375 --> 1:18:38.875
I can't anymore.

1:18:44.333 --> 1:18:45.666
How peaceful.

1:18:47.041 --> 1:18:47.916
What?

1:19:08.125 --> 1:19:09.250
We have to go.

1:21:05.416 --> 1:21:06.583
Good morning.

1:22:03.958 --> 1:22:04.958
Will they come back?

1:22:05.750 --> 1:22:06.791
No.

1:22:51.166 --> 1:22:52.541
No.

1:22:52.625 --> 1:22:53.916
-Drink.
-No.

1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:55.166
You have to drink.

1:23:11.416 --> 1:23:12.750
I have something for you.

1:23:15.666 --> 1:23:16.916
Close your eyes.

1:23:20.125 --> 1:23:22.000
Who will open them again?

1:23:22.833 --> 1:23:24.416
So don't close them.

1:23:39.750 --> 1:23:42.291
-What are these?
-Mimosas.

1:23:44.458 --> 1:23:45.791
How lovely.

1:23:47.750 --> 1:23:49.250
How lovely.

1:23:52.541 --> 1:23:54.708
I couldn't find real ones.

1:23:56.291 --> 1:23:59.791
This is the most beautiful gift
I've ever received.

1:24:16.375 --> 1:24:18.000
You're a good boy.

1:24:21.291 --> 1:24:23.541
If you want, you can come live with me.

1:24:27.541 --> 1:24:29.041
We'll be happy together.

1:25:09.458 --> 1:25:11.333
Sit and have a sip of water.

1:25:13.916 --> 1:25:15.000
Momo?

1:25:15.833 --> 1:25:18.500
I told you to stay with Dr. Coen.

1:25:24.541 --> 1:25:25.666
Momo?

1:25:28.500 --> 1:25:30.541
Wait! Where are you going?

1:25:31.375 --> 1:25:32.291
Momo?

1:25:34.333 --> 1:25:35.333
Momo!

1:25:36.875 --> 1:25:39.375
Stop! Stop!

1:25:47.208 --> 1:25:48.541
Momo, open the door.

1:25:49.541 --> 1:25:51.625
Momo, open up! What are you doing?

1:25:51.708 --> 1:25:54.041
What is going on, Momo? Open the door!

1:26:57.291 --> 1:26:58.708
We'll be waiting over there.

1:28:18.958 --> 1:28:23.291
When you run out of words

1:28:24.041 --> 1:28:28.583
I'm here, I'm here

1:28:29.875 --> 1:28:34.250
Maybe the only words you'll ever need are

1:28:34.791 --> 1:28:39.750
I'm here, I'm here

1:28:40.458 --> 1:28:43.958
When you learn to survive

1:28:46.416 --> 1:28:49.583
And accept the impossible

1:28:50.375 --> 1:28:53.875
No one believes you

1:28:54.375 --> 1:28:55.833
I will

1:28:59.291 --> 1:29:05.666
I don't know

1:29:09.916 --> 1:29:16.291
What your destiny will hold

1:29:16.375 --> 1:29:23.250
But if you want
If you want me

1:29:23.333 --> 1:29:27.458
I'm here

1:29:28.208 --> 1:29:31.250
No one hears you

1:29:31.333 --> 1:29:33.791
But I will

1:29:34.541 --> 1:29:39.333
When you lose your way

1:29:39.916 --> 1:29:45.208
I'm here, I'm here

1:29:45.291 --> 1:29:50.708
You run away or put up defenses

1:29:50.791 --> 1:29:56.041
I'm here, I'm here

1:29:56.125 --> 1:29:59.708
When being invisible

1:30:01.708 --> 1:30:05.000
Is worse than not being alive

1:30:05.791 --> 1:30:09.000
No one sees you

1:30:09.750 --> 1:30:11.375
I will

1:30:14.750 --> 1:30:20.583
I don't know

1:30:25.416 --> 1:30:31.458
What your destiny will hold

1:30:31.958 --> 1:30:38.875
But if you want
If you want me

1:30:38.958 --> 1:30:42.958
I'm here

1:30:43.708 --> 1:30:46.458
No one sees you

1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:49.791
But I will

1:30:49.875 --> 1:30:54.416
Love needs magic and reality

1:30:55.208 --> 1:31:00.916
But sometimes all you need

1:31:01.000 --> 1:31:07.958
Is what's already there

1:31:10.541 --> 1:31:16.083
In the life ahead

1:31:19.375 --> 1:31:25.875
I don't know

1:31:30.125 --> 1:31:36.375
What your destiny will hold

1:31:36.458 --> 1:31:43.416
But if you want
If you want me

1:31:43.500 --> 1:31:48.083
I'm here

1:31:48.166 --> 1:31:51.208
No one sees you

1:31:52.125 --> 1:31:54.583
I will

1:31:56.416 --> 1:31:59.041
No one believes you

1:31:59.750 --> 1:32:02.791
But I will

1:34:00.208 --> 1:34:02.625
This film was completed
during the Covid-19 pandemic.

1:34:02.708 --> 1:34:05.083
The director and producers
thank the artists and crew

1:34:05.166 --> 1:34:06.500
for making this film a reality.
