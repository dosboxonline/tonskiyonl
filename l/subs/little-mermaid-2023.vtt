WEBVTT

01:52.029 --> 01:53.906
- Watch it!

01:53.906 --> 01:55.074
More harpoons!

01:55.074 --> 01:56.575
Ready the nets, men!

01:56.742 --> 01:58.869
I say kill her 'afore
she comes aboard!

01:58.869 --> 01:59.995
Where is she? Let me see!

02:00.704 --> 02:02.122
Wait. Wait. Wait.

02:04.208 --> 02:05.709
She's a fast one.

02:05.876 --> 02:08.254
- Hand me another!
She's getting away!

02:08.254 --> 02:09.839
I think
she's smilin' at you.

02:12.216 --> 02:13.300
I missed her.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.011
- Another one.
Come on, another one!

02:18.889 --> 02:20.266
Hey! Hey! Hey!

02:20.432 --> 02:22.059
Move! Move! Get back!

02:22.643 --> 02:23.644
What are you doing?

02:23.644 --> 02:25.271
- It's a mermaid!
- A mermaid?

02:25.437 --> 02:26.522
Use your eyes!

02:29.650 --> 02:30.651
What were you thinking?

02:31.193 --> 02:32.403
These are dangerous waters.

02:32.570 --> 02:34.446
And this is a dangerous time.

02:34.613 --> 02:36.365
Tonight's the Coral Moon.

02:36.532 --> 02:38.325
They say this is
when the Sea King calls

02:38.325 --> 02:40.369
his mermaid daughters together

02:40.536 --> 02:41.996
to lure men to their deaths.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.289
- Is that what they say?
- Aye.

02:43.455 --> 02:46.083
Not even the strongest
can resist their spell.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.459
It's just an old lore.

02:53.257 --> 02:54.550
Back to work!

02:54.550 --> 02:55.801
Come on, lads.
- You see there?

02:55.801 --> 02:57.261
See what, Hawkins?

02:57.261 --> 03:00.389
Crosswind gust kicked up
the chop, that's all.

03:00.556 --> 03:02.433
- That's the Sea King's doing.
- Give me a hand, mate.

03:02.433 --> 03:04.810
He'd pull us under himself
if he could.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.854
Sail faster!
Raising the main!

03:06.854 --> 03:08.022
This line's tight.

03:08.898 --> 03:10.274
Where's Prince Eric?

03:10.274 --> 03:13.193
- Up at the bow, Sir Grimsby.

03:16.947 --> 03:18.908
- Whoo!
- Eric!

03:18.908 --> 03:21.076
- What are you doing out there?

03:21.243 --> 03:22.578
Get back here at once!

03:23.120 --> 03:25.706
You ought to stop worrying
so much about me, Grimsby.

03:25.706 --> 03:27.875
Call me selfish,

03:28.042 --> 03:29.835
but I do not want
to tell the Queen

03:29.835 --> 03:32.630
that her son fell
overboard on my watch.

03:32.630 --> 03:34.715
And on his birthday,
of all days.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.928
Looks like there's
a Spanish galleon out there

03:38.928 --> 03:40.346
headed toward the mainland.

03:40.346 --> 03:42.056
We could follow it to port,

03:42.056 --> 03:43.891
see what they've brought
to trade.

03:44.058 --> 03:46.852
Our ship is loaded
to the gills as it is.

03:47.019 --> 03:48.604
We've risked
our necks out here

03:48.604 --> 03:50.356
for seven weeks already.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.775
We're going home tonight.

03:52.942 --> 03:53.943
Eric.

03:54.610 --> 03:55.986
- Pay attention.

03:55.986 --> 03:57.446
I need you to be more careful.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.616
Careful, Grimsby!

05:57.941 --> 06:00.235
My Daughters
of the Seven Seas,

06:00.694 --> 06:02.988
I welcome news
from all of your waters.

06:04.239 --> 06:06.450
Tamika, Perla,

06:06.617 --> 06:08.285
it's so good to see you.

06:09.953 --> 06:12.164
Caspia, Indira,

06:12.164 --> 06:15.375
it fills my heart
to have you all here.

06:15.542 --> 06:16.543
Mala,

06:17.336 --> 06:18.837
Karina...

06:23.801 --> 06:25.385
Where is Ariel?

06:29.181 --> 06:30.808
Sebastian?

06:31.892 --> 06:34.853
You were supposed to see to it
that Ariel was here.

06:34.853 --> 06:37.397
I tried, Your Majesty,

06:37.397 --> 06:39.775
but that child,
she is impossible.

06:39.775 --> 06:41.610
I reminded her

06:41.610 --> 06:44.029
about the gathering
just this mornin'.

06:44.196 --> 06:46.198
What more can
one crustacean do?

06:47.533 --> 06:49.618
You can go find her.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.161
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes.

06:51.161 --> 06:52.412
Right away.

06:53.747 --> 06:54.748
"Yes, Your Majesty.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.375
"Right away, Your Majesty."

06:56.542 --> 06:59.169
How hard can it be
to find a mermaid, after all?

06:59.336 --> 07:01.672
If I'm lucky, I'll only have
to search one ocean.

07:02.589 --> 07:06.176
Where are you, child?

07:30.742 --> 07:33.579
We aren't supposed to be this
far from the palace, Ariel.

07:33.745 --> 07:34.997
- Let's go back.
Oh!

07:35.414 --> 07:36.957
How does that work?

07:37.124 --> 07:39.293
Come on, Ariel. Please?

07:39.293 --> 07:42.087
Oh, Flounder,
stop being such a guppy!

07:42.254 --> 07:43.922
I'm not a guppy.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.349
I think we've gone far enough.

07:57.144 --> 07:58.145
Wait.

07:58.312 --> 07:59.980
What is that?

08:00.147 --> 08:01.648
I've never seen that one.

08:03.775 --> 08:04.860
Come on.

08:05.027 --> 08:06.737
Ariel! Wait for me!

08:09.948 --> 08:11.742
You know I can't swim
that fast.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.928
Whoa. Look at all that.

08:31.803 --> 08:34.806
They must have used the ship
for battles or something.

08:34.973 --> 08:36.850
Yeah, great.

08:37.017 --> 08:38.477
Now let's get out of here.

08:38.644 --> 08:40.646
- Getting cold fins?
- Who, me?

08:41.271 --> 08:42.898
- No way.
- Good.

08:43.065 --> 08:46.235
Then you can stay out here
and watch for sharks.

08:46.401 --> 08:47.736
All right, good.

08:48.528 --> 08:49.529
What?

08:49.696 --> 08:51.406
Ariel, wait!

09:05.754 --> 09:07.756
Do you really think there
might be sharks around here?

09:08.423 --> 09:09.841
Oh, Flounder.

09:13.512 --> 09:14.638
Look at this.

09:14.805 --> 09:15.806
Whoa.

09:15.973 --> 09:18.392
It's the smallest trident
I've ever seen.

09:20.394 --> 09:22.020
I'm King Flounder,

09:22.020 --> 09:24.856
- Lord of the Seven Seas!

09:24.856 --> 09:27.609
I wonder why a human
would need one that size.

09:27.609 --> 09:28.944
I bet Scuttle will know.

09:29.361 --> 09:30.862
She always does.

09:33.615 --> 09:34.908
Will you relax?

09:35.075 --> 09:37.494
- It's just your reflection.
- Whew.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.912
Calm down.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.498
Nothing is going to happen.

09:42.249 --> 09:43.250
Flounder, look out!

10:18.201 --> 10:19.328
Flounder!

11:04.873 --> 11:06.458
You okay, Flounder?

11:06.458 --> 11:09.878
Uh, sure. I mean,
I've seen bigger sharks.

11:09.878 --> 11:12.047
Just, you know,
you can't back down.

11:12.214 --> 11:13.882
You gotta show 'em who's in...

11:15.759 --> 11:18.887
Come back, Flounder.
It's just Scuttle.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.481
Ariel. Hey, kid, how ya doin'?

11:29.648 --> 11:31.525
Don't mind me,
I was just grabbin' a snack.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.276
Scuttle, we found
more treasure.

11:33.443 --> 11:35.320
Yeah. We went
into this sunken ship,

11:35.487 --> 11:36.905
and it was really creepy.

11:37.072 --> 11:38.865
Human stuff. A-ha.

11:38.865 --> 11:39.950
All right, all right,
let me see.

11:39.950 --> 11:41.284
Let... Let... Let me see.

11:41.284 --> 11:42.661
Any idea what this is?

11:42.661 --> 11:44.704
Oh. Oh, oh, oh!

11:44.704 --> 11:45.997
Wow.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.207
This...

11:47.207 --> 11:48.625
This is... Yeah.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.419
This is very, very unusual.

11:50.419 --> 11:52.796
- What? What is it?
- It's a...

11:52.796 --> 11:54.131
It's a dinglehopper.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.383
- A dinglehopper.
- Yeah. Yeah.

11:56.383 --> 12:00.220
Humans use these babies
to style their hair.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.847
You just give it
a little twirl,

12:01.847 --> 12:04.266
a little yank, you might
get some pieces with it,

12:04.433 --> 12:06.309
and you're left with
an artistically pleasing

12:06.309 --> 12:08.812
conflagration of hair
that humans go nuts for.

12:08.812 --> 12:11.231
Really? I would love
to see that.

12:11.398 --> 12:12.816
- Can't.
- Flounder.

12:12.816 --> 12:13.942
You know it's true.

12:14.317 --> 12:16.361
Your father still won't let
you go to the surface, huh?

12:16.528 --> 12:17.696
No, it's forbidden.

12:17.863 --> 12:20.115
He thinks all humans
are barbarians.

12:20.282 --> 12:22.576
Oh, they're not so bad.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.286
Unless you're a coconut.

12:24.453 --> 12:25.454
They hate coconuts.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.289
I swear, they get
a hold of one,

12:27.456 --> 12:30.041
they smash it to pieces,
just like that. It's weird.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.626
- And what's this?
Ariel!

12:31.626 --> 12:33.003
- Swam half across

12:33.003 --> 12:34.546
a whole ocean lookin'
for this child. Ariel!

12:34.546 --> 12:35.630
Ow!

12:35.630 --> 12:36.715
Sebastian!

12:36.715 --> 12:39.009
- Sorry about that!
Ariel!

12:39.009 --> 12:40.469
What are you doin' up there?

12:41.094 --> 12:43.096
Wasting your time
with this know-nothing bird

12:43.096 --> 12:44.681
that can't tell swimmin'
from flyin'?

12:45.056 --> 12:47.267
- Hey!
- I suppose you've completely

12:47.267 --> 12:49.728
forgotten tonight's
the Coral Moon?

12:49.895 --> 12:50.896
Oh, no!

12:50.896 --> 12:52.189
Oh, yes!

12:52.355 --> 12:54.399
The gatherin'
of King Triton's daughters,

12:54.399 --> 12:55.484
minus one.

12:55.484 --> 12:57.486
My father's gonna kill me!

12:57.486 --> 12:59.196
- Sorry, Scuttle, gotta go!
- Yeah, yeah.

12:59.362 --> 13:00.822
All right, sweetie. Me too.

13:00.989 --> 13:01.990
Gotta get some air.

13:18.340 --> 13:21.468
<i>Yes, hurry home, Princess.</i>

13:22.344 --> 13:23.345
<i>We wouldn't want to be late</i>

13:23.345 --> 13:26.014
<i>for Daddy's gathering, now,
would we?</i>

13:27.265 --> 13:29.351
Perhaps I'll join them.

13:29.518 --> 13:32.646
Oh, wait, what a shame.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.898
It seems that
Big Brother forgot

13:34.898 --> 13:38.068
to invite Auntie Ursula
to the party.

13:38.235 --> 13:39.611
Again.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.656
Oh, I should be the one
throwing the parties,

13:42.656 --> 13:45.575
- not waiting on an invitation.

13:47.285 --> 13:50.789
Oh, the feasts we had
when I lived in the palace!

13:54.834 --> 13:58.755
And now look at me,
the family pariah.

13:58.922 --> 14:02.467
Wasting away
to practically nothing.

14:02.634 --> 14:06.304
Banished and exiled,
driven halfway to madness

14:06.471 --> 14:11.977
in this dim little crevice
for 15 long years.

14:13.353 --> 14:16.606
While Daddy and his spoiled
little mer-brats

14:16.606 --> 14:18.733
celebrate the Coral Moon.

14:20.110 --> 14:24.197
Well, I'll give them
something to celebrate.

14:25.949 --> 14:29.160
I may have finally found
Daddy's weakness.

14:29.953 --> 14:30.996
Yes.

14:32.205 --> 14:36.626
Red's fascination with humans
might be just the opening

14:36.793 --> 14:39.212
I've been waiting for.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.383
It is irresponsible.

14:43.550 --> 14:44.759
Your sisters are only here

14:44.759 --> 14:46.511
for one phase
of the Coral Moon.

14:46.511 --> 14:47.887
Can you imagine
any one of them

14:47.887 --> 14:50.765
- missing the gathering?
No. You're right.

14:50.932 --> 14:53.184
- I'm sorry.
- It wasn't Ariel's fault.

14:53.351 --> 14:56.187
We... We... We were exploring,
and a shark chased us and...

14:56.187 --> 14:57.439
Shark?

14:57.606 --> 14:59.232
So, you went
to the shipwrecks again?

15:00.692 --> 15:02.569
Those waters are dangerous.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.070
You don't have
to worry about me.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.406
Well, I do worry,
my little one. I do worry.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.408
This obsession with humans
has to stop.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.285
I just want to know more
about them.

15:10.785 --> 15:11.911
You know all you need to know.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.288
I barely know anything.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.081
You won't even let us go
to the surface.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.208
Why do you have
to be so strong-minded?

15:17.375 --> 15:19.127
- Just like your mother. It...
- I am her daughter.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.004
Yes, foolish enough
to be taken

15:21.004 --> 15:22.088
with the human world.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.757
If you would just try
to understand...

15:23.757 --> 15:24.841
Well, I have tried.

15:24.841 --> 15:26.760
I have tried
to understand you long enough.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.511
But as long as you live
in my ocean,

15:28.511 --> 15:30.221
you'll obey my rules.

15:30.388 --> 15:32.223
Do you understand that?

15:45.612 --> 15:47.238
Children, you give them
an inch,

15:47.238 --> 15:48.907
- they swim all over you.

15:49.074 --> 15:50.533
Was I too hard on her?

15:50.700 --> 15:51.785
Definitely not.

15:51.951 --> 15:53.495
It's like I always say,

15:53.662 --> 15:56.414
"Children got to live
by their parent's rules."

15:56.581 --> 15:58.750
You're absolutely right, Sebastian.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.001
Hmm.

16:00.001 --> 16:02.045
My Ariel needs
constant supervision.

16:02.212 --> 16:03.338
Constant.

16:03.505 --> 16:04.756
Someone to watch over her.

16:04.923 --> 16:06.883
All the time, day and night.

16:07.050 --> 16:08.718
And you're just the crab
to do it.

16:08.718 --> 16:09.803
I am just the crab to...

16:09.803 --> 16:11.304
No, wait, that's not... What?

16:11.304 --> 16:13.264
No, see, I serve you,
Your Majesty,

16:13.264 --> 16:15.266
as your honored majordomo.

16:15.975 --> 16:17.644
There is no better way
you can serve me

16:17.644 --> 16:19.104
than to make sure
my little one

16:19.104 --> 16:20.188
stays out of trouble.

16:20.355 --> 16:21.690
- But I...
Yes?

16:21.856 --> 16:22.857
Go.

16:24.109 --> 16:25.110
Go.

16:25.276 --> 16:27.612
Yes, Your Majesty.

16:28.655 --> 16:30.490
How do I get myself
into these situations?

16:30.490 --> 16:32.283
I'm an educated crustacean.

16:32.450 --> 16:33.576
I got options.

16:33.743 --> 16:34.869
I don't need this.

16:35.036 --> 16:36.329
I should be advising the King,

16:36.329 --> 16:39.290
not chasing after
some headstrong teenager.

17:13.658 --> 17:16.077
Ariel, are you okay?

17:16.244 --> 17:17.871
He doesn't even hear me.

17:18.663 --> 17:20.373
I'm just not like him.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.375
I don't see things
the way he does.

17:23.752 --> 17:25.211
And I...

17:25.378 --> 17:28.131
I don't see how a world
that makes

17:28.298 --> 17:31.342
such wonderful things
could be so bad.

17:32.093 --> 17:35.680
<i>Look at this stuff
Isn't it neat?</i>

17:35.847 --> 17:39.684
<i>Wouldn't you think
My collection's complete?</i>

17:39.851 --> 17:42.479
<i>Wouldn't you think
I'm the girl</i>

17:42.645 --> 17:46.065
<i>The girl who has ev'rything?</i>

17:47.400 --> 17:51.154
<i>Look at this trove
Treasures untold</i>

17:51.321 --> 17:54.908
<i>How many wonders
Can one cavern hold?</i>

17:55.074 --> 17:57.702
<i>Looking around here
You'd think</i>

17:57.869 --> 18:02.081
<i>Sure, she's got ev'rything</i>

18:02.248 --> 18:05.919
<i>I've got gadgets
And gizmos aplenty</i>

18:06.085 --> 18:09.839
<i>I've got "who's its"
And "what's its" galore</i>

18:10.006 --> 18:11.966
<i>You want thingamabobs?</i>

18:12.133 --> 18:13.968
<i>I got 20</i>

18:14.135 --> 18:16.346
<i>But who cares?</i>

18:16.513 --> 18:19.182
<i>No big deal</i>

18:19.349 --> 18:25.522
<i>I want more</i>

18:27.023 --> 18:30.026
<i>I wanna be
Where the people are</i>

18:30.902 --> 18:35.031
<i>I wanna see
Wanna see 'em dancing</i>

18:35.198 --> 18:37.742
<i>Walkin' around on those...</i>

18:37.909 --> 18:40.912
<i>What do you call 'em?
Oh! Feet!</i>

18:43.289 --> 18:46.918
<i>Flippin' your fins
You don't get too far</i>

18:47.085 --> 18:50.588
<i>Legs are required
For jumpin', dancin'</i>

18:50.755 --> 18:52.966
<i>Strollin' along down a...</i>

18:53.132 --> 18:55.009
<i>What's that word again?</i>

18:55.176 --> 18:57.303
<i>Street</i>

18:57.470 --> 19:01.474
<i>Up where they walk
Up where they run</i>

19:01.641 --> 19:05.812
<i>Up where they stay all day
In the sun</i>

19:05.812 --> 19:09.691
<i>Wanderin' free
Wish I could be</i>

19:09.858 --> 19:14.028
<i>Part of that world</i>

19:14.195 --> 19:15.655
<i>What would I give</i>

19:15.822 --> 19:21.035
<i>If I could live
Out of these waters?</i>

19:21.202 --> 19:23.121
<i>What would I pay</i>

19:23.288 --> 19:29.127
<i>To spend a day
Warm on the sand?</i>

19:29.294 --> 19:33.256
<i>Bet ya on land they understand</i>

19:33.423 --> 19:37.677
<i>Bet they don't
Reprimand their daughters</i>

19:37.844 --> 19:41.347
<i>Bright young women
Sick of swimmin'</i>

19:41.514 --> 19:45.685
<i>Ready to stand</i>

19:45.685 --> 19:50.523
<i>And ready to know
What the people know</i>

19:50.690 --> 19:54.944
<i>Ask 'em my questions
And get some answers</i>

19:54.944 --> 19:57.280
<i>What's a fire
And why does it...</i>

19:57.447 --> 19:58.990
<i>What's the word?</i>

19:59.157 --> 20:01.326
<i>Burn?</i>

20:01.492 --> 20:03.494
<i>When's it my turn?</i>

20:03.661 --> 20:05.496
<i>Wouldn't I love</i>

20:05.663 --> 20:12.629
<i>Love to explore
That shore up above</i>

20:19.010 --> 20:22.722
<i>Out of the sea</i>

20:25.433 --> 20:32.023
<i>Wish I could be</i>

20:34.275 --> 20:41.240
<i>Part of that world</i>

21:13.439 --> 21:14.440
Ariel!

21:14.607 --> 21:15.608
Don't!

21:18.194 --> 21:20.530
Oh, no, no, no!

21:20.697 --> 21:22.240
What does she think she doin'?

22:11.914 --> 22:14.208
Oh!
Oh!

22:14.208 --> 22:17.754
<i>I'll tell you a tale
Of the bottomless blue</i>

22:17.754 --> 22:21.049
<i>And it's hey to the starboard
Heave ho! Heave ho!</i>

22:21.215 --> 22:24.302
<i>Look out, lad, a mermaid
Be waitin' for you</i>

22:24.302 --> 22:27.013
<i>In mysterious fathoms below</i>

22:38.775 --> 22:40.068
Who's an old man?

22:40.234 --> 22:42.820
<i>I'll sing you a song
Of the King of the Sea!</i>

22:42.820 --> 22:46.407
<i>And it's hey to the starboard
Heave ho! Heave ho!</i>

22:46.407 --> 22:49.702
<i>The ruler of all of the oceans
And seas</i>

22:49.702 --> 22:53.372
<i>In mysterious fathoms below
Heave ho!</i>

22:53.539 --> 22:55.333
<i>Heave ho!</i>

22:55.500 --> 22:56.501
<i>Heave ho!</i>

22:56.667 --> 22:57.668
Enough!

22:57.668 --> 22:58.753
<i>Heave ho!</i>

22:58.753 --> 22:59.879
Thank you, gentlemen.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.506
Oh, let's have
a dance, aye.

23:01.506 --> 23:03.382
Oh, come on.
It's his birthday.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.635
- Oh, come on, Grimsby.

23:05.802 --> 23:07.428
What's wrong with me
having a little fun?

23:07.595 --> 23:08.638
Everyone else is.

23:08.638 --> 23:10.681
You, sire,
are not everyone else.

23:10.848 --> 23:12.266
It's time
you separated yourself

23:12.266 --> 23:13.351
from the rest of the crew.

23:13.518 --> 23:15.394
- Oh, but I'm one of them.
- And behave in a manner

23:15.561 --> 23:17.980
more becoming
of a future king.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.858
You mean, be more
like my father was?

23:21.025 --> 23:22.401
Cut off from the rest
of the world.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.320
Oh, Eric,
you know what I mean.

23:24.987 --> 23:26.823
When you came to us
21 years ago,

23:26.989 --> 23:28.491
the King and Queen took you in

23:28.491 --> 23:31.327
and treated you
as one of their own.

23:31.786 --> 23:32.787
Now that you've come of age...

23:32.787 --> 23:34.163
Max.

23:34.163 --> 23:35.248
Max!

23:35.623 --> 23:36.999
What are you doing over there?
Come here, boy!

23:37.667 --> 23:38.668
Come on. Come on.

23:39.710 --> 23:40.711
Go on.

23:40.711 --> 23:42.338
And now
that you have come of age,

23:42.505 --> 23:45.383
your responsibilities
are at home.

23:45.550 --> 23:47.009
Your father would
have expected that.

23:47.009 --> 23:48.761
Yes, trapped inside
that castle

23:48.761 --> 23:50.388
in isolation and fear.

23:51.180 --> 23:52.181
I can't do it.

23:52.348 --> 23:54.225
I believe a little
fear may be advisable, sire.

23:54.225 --> 23:55.434
Grimsby, you're not listening.

23:56.227 --> 23:57.854
I want to be
a different kind of leader.

23:58.062 --> 23:59.522
That's the whole reason
we're on this voyage,

23:59.522 --> 24:00.773
don't you see?

24:01.440 --> 24:03.025
We have to stay open
to what's out here.

24:03.192 --> 24:05.653
That's the only way
our island can grow.

24:05.820 --> 24:07.989
Eric,
think what you risk.

24:08.156 --> 24:09.699
I can't explain it, Grims.

24:09.866 --> 24:11.576
It's in my blood.

24:11.742 --> 24:12.827
Even now, I...

24:13.828 --> 24:16.414
I feel there's something
out here calling to me.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.836
Storm coming in fast.

24:25.923 --> 24:27.258
- Squall coming in!
Squall!

24:27.258 --> 24:28.551
All hands on deck!

24:28.551 --> 24:29.927
All hands on deck!

24:29.927 --> 24:31.596
Batten down the hatches
and crates!

24:31.596 --> 24:32.680
Yes, sir!

24:33.890 --> 24:34.891
Tie 'em down!

24:37.143 --> 24:39.103
Get the ropes in!
Tie her down!

24:39.270 --> 24:41.105
Man the pumps!
Man the pumps!

24:41.898 --> 24:43.649
Pull the main sail!

24:48.905 --> 24:50.615
Clew up
and stow the main course!

24:50.781 --> 24:51.866
We're over-canvassed!

24:52.533 --> 24:54.160
Brail up
the foresail!

25:06.339 --> 25:07.632
Stow all of the sails!

25:09.634 --> 25:10.760
Clew that!

25:14.347 --> 25:16.432
Drop it down. Open up!

25:42.500 --> 25:43.584
Oi, lads!

25:43.584 --> 25:45.169
Fire!

25:50.758 --> 25:52.051
Grab the port side!

26:02.228 --> 26:04.397
Lifeboats! Abandon ship!

26:04.563 --> 26:05.606
Abandon ship!

26:05.606 --> 26:07.066
Abandon ship!

26:07.233 --> 26:08.484
Into the water, boy!

26:08.651 --> 26:10.152
- Go! Now!
Jump!

26:11.028 --> 26:12.071
Get in. Get in!

26:12.238 --> 26:13.239
Jump!

26:28.754 --> 26:30.006
Give me
your hand, boy.

26:30.006 --> 26:31.632
Come on, get up. Hold on!

26:31.632 --> 26:33.551
Boy! In here. All right?

26:34.802 --> 26:36.846
- Max.

26:54.947 --> 26:57.867
That's it. That's it, boy.
Come on, boy. That's it.

27:00.244 --> 27:02.455
All right, boy. Go on. Go on.

27:06.625 --> 27:07.626
Come here, boy!

27:08.294 --> 27:09.962
- Max! Come on!
Good boy!

27:16.552 --> 27:17.928
Come on.

27:17.928 --> 27:19.221
Come on, Max.

27:19.221 --> 27:20.306
There you go.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.558
- I got ya.
- Eric!

29:16.755 --> 29:18.716
Oh, no.

29:18.716 --> 29:21.427
Ahh! Get off me, you fool!

29:21.594 --> 29:24.221
Oh, hey. Didn't expect
to find you here.

29:24.388 --> 29:26.807
And I really didn't expect
to find her here.

29:26.807 --> 29:28.851
Uh-uh. Hey.
You listen to me, bird.

29:29.018 --> 29:31.312
The King can never
hear of this.

29:31.479 --> 29:34.231
We are going to forget
this ever happened.

29:34.231 --> 29:36.192
- Ow!
- Are you listenin' to me?

29:36.192 --> 29:37.359
Yes.

29:37.359 --> 29:39.695
You won't tell him,
I won't tell him,

29:39.862 --> 29:41.947
and I will stay in one piece.
You got it?

29:41.947 --> 29:44.241
Got it. Sorry,
what'd you say again?

29:44.241 --> 29:45.743
I'm a dead crab.

29:56.629 --> 30:00.883
<i>What would I give
To live where you are?</i>

30:02.384 --> 30:07.932
<i>What would I pay
To stay here beside you?</i>

30:08.098 --> 30:15.064
<i>What would I do
To see you smiling at me?</i>

30:17.775 --> 30:20.819
<i>Where would we walk?</i>

30:20.986 --> 30:23.614
<i>Where would we run</i>

30:23.781 --> 30:29.411
<i>If we could stay all day
In the sun?</i>

30:29.578 --> 30:32.206
<i>Just you and me</i>

30:32.373 --> 30:34.875
<i>And I could be</i>

30:34.875 --> 30:40.881
<i>Part of your world?</i>

30:43.801 --> 30:45.469
Check the cove, men.

30:46.053 --> 30:47.304
Checking the cove!

30:48.514 --> 30:50.558
Eyes peeled!
On the other side!

30:50.558 --> 30:52.476
Move it, lads.
Follow me.

30:54.895 --> 30:56.355
Down on the sand!

30:57.356 --> 30:58.482
Over here!

31:00.025 --> 31:01.193
This way.

31:06.282 --> 31:07.491
Is he breathing?

31:08.492 --> 31:09.493
He's alive.

31:09.660 --> 31:11.036
Alert the Queen!

31:11.579 --> 31:12.955
- You lead, mate.
Go quickly, lads.

31:13.664 --> 31:14.832
Back to the castle.

31:17.418 --> 31:18.711
Go ahead.

31:19.545 --> 31:21.088
Go, let's go!

31:22.214 --> 31:23.340
Let's go.

31:24.967 --> 31:27.553
<i>I don't know when</i>

31:27.720 --> 31:30.180
<i>I don't know how</i>

31:30.347 --> 31:37.354
<i>But I know something's
Starting right now</i>

31:38.230 --> 31:42.568
<i>Watch and you'll see</i>

31:42.735 --> 31:47.406
<i>Someday I'll be</i>

31:47.906 --> 31:54.913
<i>Part of your world</i>

32:04.798 --> 32:06.425
No.

32:06.425 --> 32:10.429
No, it's too easy.

32:10.429 --> 32:13.265
She's already in love
with the human world

32:13.432 --> 32:15.851
and now she found
her soulmate.

32:15.851 --> 32:16.935
Ugh.

32:17.478 --> 32:20.105
Oh, wait until
Daddy finds out.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.941
He's gonna hit the surface.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.861
That little girl's
gonna run straight

32:25.861 --> 32:28.405
into my tentacles.

32:28.989 --> 32:32.117
Then I'll use her as a prawn
in my little game

32:32.284 --> 32:36.246
and finally get to rip
the power away from Triton

32:36.246 --> 32:39.291
that should've been mine
all along.

32:43.962 --> 32:45.422
All right.

32:45.422 --> 32:46.840
Okay.

32:47.007 --> 32:48.967
As long as the King
never finds out,

32:48.967 --> 32:51.220
everything will be all right.

32:51.387 --> 32:52.846
He never has to know she used

32:52.846 --> 32:56.225
that precious siren song
of hers to save a human.

32:57.643 --> 33:00.354
I just have to find Ariel
and get her back home.

33:00.354 --> 33:02.231
Now, uh,

33:02.231 --> 33:03.816
she was around here somewhere.

33:03.816 --> 33:06.318
Ah-ha. Ah, yeah,
this must be it.

33:06.944 --> 33:08.862
I just have to be firm
with her,

33:09.029 --> 33:11.323
get her to see that this is
all just a passing fad

33:11.323 --> 33:14.493
and in time, she'll forget
all about him.

33:15.285 --> 33:16.537
Ariel!

33:16.704 --> 33:18.205
Sebastian,
how did you find me?

33:18.372 --> 33:19.957
What is all of this?

33:20.124 --> 33:21.625
What are you doin'
with that...

33:21.792 --> 33:23.210
that thing?

33:24.086 --> 33:25.421
Isn't it beautiful?

33:26.463 --> 33:28.006
Look at the longing
in his eyes.

33:28.173 --> 33:29.341
What you know about longin'?

33:29.508 --> 33:30.968
What is he doin' here?

33:31.135 --> 33:32.594
It's from the shipwreck.

33:32.594 --> 33:33.971
I found him at Merman's Reef.

33:33.971 --> 33:35.389
And I'll bet
there's so much more.

33:35.556 --> 33:37.141
No, no! Ariel!

33:37.307 --> 33:38.642
Child, get back here.

33:39.184 --> 33:40.185
Ariel!

33:41.103 --> 33:43.731
You have to let go
of this obsession with humans.

33:43.731 --> 33:45.107
I'm not obsessed.

33:45.107 --> 33:46.942
I may be crusty,
but I'm not blind.

33:46.942 --> 33:49.611
I saw you the night
of the shipwreck.

33:49.778 --> 33:51.780
- What?
- Your father wants you to stay

33:51.780 --> 33:54.074
as far away from them
as possible!

33:54.241 --> 33:56.368
- But why?
- You know why.

33:56.368 --> 33:59.121
We don't have to be afraid
of them, I know that now.

33:59.288 --> 34:01.623
Sebastian, if you had
just seen it up there.

34:01.623 --> 34:03.292
The ship rode on the wind,

34:03.292 --> 34:05.210
and they filled the sky
with fire.

34:05.210 --> 34:07.296
Okay, okay. Listen to me.

34:07.463 --> 34:10.048
The human world is a mess.

34:10.215 --> 34:11.759
Life under the sea is better

34:11.759 --> 34:13.844
than anything
they got goin' on up there.

34:14.928 --> 34:17.473
<i>The seaweed
Is always greener</i>

34:17.639 --> 34:19.600
<i>In somebody else's lake</i>

34:20.184 --> 34:22.644
<i>You dream about going up there</i>

34:22.811 --> 34:25.063
<i>But that is a big mistake</i>

34:25.063 --> 34:27.649
<i>Just look at the world
Around you</i>

34:27.649 --> 34:30.027
<i>Right here on the ocean floor</i>

34:30.194 --> 34:32.613
<i>Such wonderful things
Surround you</i>

34:32.780 --> 34:34.656
<i>What more is you lookin' for?</i>

34:35.324 --> 34:36.909
<i>Under the sea</i>

34:37.951 --> 34:39.536
<i>Under the sea</i>

34:40.454 --> 34:42.790
<i>Darling, it's better
Down where it's wetter</i>

34:42.956 --> 34:44.374
<i>Take it from me</i>

34:45.751 --> 34:47.795
<i>Up on the shore
They work all day</i>

34:47.961 --> 34:50.047
<i>Out in the sun they slave away</i>

34:50.297 --> 34:52.883
<i>While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'</i>

34:53.050 --> 34:54.468
<i>Under the sea</i>

34:59.097 --> 35:01.433
<i>Down here
All the fish is happy</i>

35:01.600 --> 35:03.811
<i>As off through the waves
They roll</i>

35:03.977 --> 35:06.188
<i>The fish on the land
Ain't happy</i>

35:06.355 --> 35:08.732
<i>They sad 'cause
They in they bowl</i>

35:08.732 --> 35:11.401
<i>But fish in the bowl is lucky</i>

35:11.568 --> 35:13.695
<i>They in for a worser fate</i>

35:13.862 --> 35:16.240
<i>One day when the boss
Get hungry</i>

35:16.406 --> 35:18.242
<i>Guess who's gon' be
On the plate</i>

35:18.242 --> 35:20.285
<i>Oh, no
Under the sea</i>

35:21.787 --> 35:23.664
<i>Under the sea</i>

35:24.248 --> 35:26.458
<i>Nobody beat us
Fry us and eat us</i>

35:26.625 --> 35:28.085
<i>In fricassee</i>

35:29.211 --> 35:31.672
<i>We what the land folks
Love to cook</i>

35:31.839 --> 35:34.174
<i>Under the sea
We off the hook</i>

35:34.174 --> 35:35.467
<i>- We got no troubles</i>

35:35.467 --> 35:36.760
<i>Life is the bubbles</i>

35:36.760 --> 35:39.304
<i>- Under the sea, hey
- Under the sea</i>

35:39.304 --> 35:41.640
<i>- Under the sea, yes, child
- Under the sea</i>

35:41.640 --> 35:43.016
<i>Since life is sweet here</i>

35:43.016 --> 35:45.185
<i>We got the beat here Naturally</i>

35:45.185 --> 35:46.520
<i>Naturally</i>

35:46.687 --> 35:49.064
<i>Even the sturgeon an' the ray</i>

35:49.231 --> 35:51.650
<i>They get the urge
'N' start to play</i>

35:51.817 --> 35:54.111
<i>We got the spirit
You got to hear it</i>

35:54.111 --> 35:56.029
<i>- Under the sea</i>

35:58.448 --> 35:59.700
- Watch this.

35:59.700 --> 36:01.076
<i>The newt play the flute</i>

36:01.076 --> 36:03.495
<i>The carp play the harp
The plaice play the bass</i>

36:03.495 --> 36:04.788
<i>And they soundin' sharp</i>

36:04.788 --> 36:05.873
<i>The bass play the brass</i>

36:05.873 --> 36:07.291
<i>The chub play the tub</i>

36:07.457 --> 36:09.293
<i>The fluke is the duke of soul</i>

36:09.293 --> 36:11.128
<i>Yeah! The ray he can play</i>

36:11.128 --> 36:13.338
<i>The lings on the strings
The trout rockin' out</i>

36:13.505 --> 36:14.631
<i>The blackfish she sings</i>

36:14.631 --> 36:17.467
<i>The smelt and the sprat
They know where it's at</i>

36:17.467 --> 36:20.053
<i>And oh, that blowfish blow!</i>

37:24.159 --> 37:26.870
<i>- Yeah! Under the sea
- Under the sea</i>

37:26.870 --> 37:29.373
<i>- Under the sea
- Under the sea</i>

37:29.373 --> 37:31.625
<i>When the sardine
Begin the beguine</i>

37:31.792 --> 37:34.378
<i>- It's music to me
- Music is to me</i>

37:34.378 --> 37:35.462
<i>What do they got?</i>

37:35.462 --> 37:36.755
<i>- A lot of sand
- A lot of sand</i>

37:36.755 --> 37:39.591
<i>We got a hot crustacean band
Yeah!</i>

37:39.758 --> 37:42.010
<i>Each little clam here
Know how to jam here</i>

37:42.177 --> 37:44.262
<i>- Under the sea
- Under the sea</i>

37:44.429 --> 37:46.890
<i>Each little slug here
Cutting a rug here</i>

37:47.057 --> 37:49.226
<i>- Under the sea
- Under the sea</i>

37:49.393 --> 37:51.937
<i>Each little snail here
Know how to wail here</i>

37:52.104 --> 37:54.481
<i>That's why it's hotter
Under the water</i>

37:54.648 --> 37:56.858
<i>Yeah, we in luck here
Down in the muck here</i>

37:57.025 --> 38:02.322
<i>- Under the sea
- Sea</i>

38:02.322 --> 38:03.782
<i>- Yes</i>

38:05.826 --> 38:07.494
Hey, Ariel?

38:10.080 --> 38:13.000
Somebody got to nail
that girl's fins to the floor.

38:29.391 --> 38:31.560
Oh, don't tell me
Eric is still going on

38:31.560 --> 38:33.437
about this girl
who rescued him.

38:33.603 --> 38:34.813
I'm afraid so.

38:35.230 --> 38:36.898
And the shipwreck.
Any casualties?

38:37.065 --> 38:38.734
None, Your Majesty.

38:38.900 --> 38:40.318
Well, thank goodness
no lives were lost.

38:40.485 --> 38:41.570
Indeed.

38:42.446 --> 38:45.615
This restless nature of his,
it concerns me.

38:45.782 --> 38:47.576
Undertaking these
dangerous voyages.

38:47.576 --> 38:49.369
- Oh, Eric, sit.

38:49.536 --> 38:51.246
Any sign of that girl yet,
Grimsby?

38:51.413 --> 38:53.123
Have some breakfast, please.

38:53.290 --> 38:54.499
Uh, we looked, sire.

38:54.666 --> 38:55.959
There was no girl.

38:56.585 --> 38:57.919
You were lucky
to have made it to shore

38:57.919 --> 38:59.087
before you passed out.

38:59.087 --> 39:00.547
She was real.
She saved my life.

39:00.547 --> 39:01.673
Sit down, Eric.

39:01.673 --> 39:03.467
- I'm not hungry, Mother.
- I'm worried about you.

39:03.633 --> 39:05.177
You've not been yourself
since the shipwreck.

39:05.177 --> 39:06.428
Have you checked
the neighboring islands?

39:06.428 --> 39:07.804
- Not all of them, but...
- Then I will.

39:07.804 --> 39:09.139
No, you will not.

39:10.766 --> 39:12.851
You're not leaving this castle
until you're feeling better.

39:13.018 --> 39:14.436
I'll feel better
when I find her.

39:15.187 --> 39:16.188
Do not think
you're using

39:16.188 --> 39:18.148
this girl as an excuse
to run off again,

39:18.315 --> 39:19.941
risking your life
on some trade ship

39:19.941 --> 39:21.151
for the sheer adventure.

39:21.151 --> 39:22.486
"Sheer adventure"?

39:23.153 --> 39:24.654
I'm trying to reach out
to other cultures,

39:24.654 --> 39:25.906
so we don't get left behind.

39:27.157 --> 39:28.283
Did you know on this last trip

39:28.283 --> 39:30.702
we traded our cane
for 20 cases of quinine?

39:30.869 --> 39:32.329
They use it in Europe
to treat malaria.

39:32.496 --> 39:34.539
And where are
those 20 cases now?

39:34.706 --> 39:36.291
At the bottom of the sea.

39:36.291 --> 39:37.501
How many shipwrecks
have there been

39:37.501 --> 39:38.960
in our waters this year,
Prime Minister?

39:38.960 --> 39:41.379
- Uh, six, Your Majesty.
- Did you hear that, Eric?

39:41.379 --> 39:44.132
- Of course, I did.
- Shipwrecks, hurricanes,

39:44.299 --> 39:46.718
the sea gods are against us.

39:46.885 --> 39:48.386
How many times do I have to...

39:52.599 --> 39:56.311
They are eroding our land
from under us,

39:56.478 --> 39:58.188
stealing it back
into the ocean.

39:58.355 --> 39:59.731
They would kill us all
if they could.

39:59.731 --> 40:00.857
That's ridiculous.

40:00.857 --> 40:02.400
Is it?

40:02.567 --> 40:04.277
May I remind you,
that a deadly shipwreck

40:04.277 --> 40:05.862
first brought you to us.

40:06.029 --> 40:09.032
And now, I almost lost you
to one the other day.

40:09.699 --> 40:11.368
We cannot keep
tempting fate like this.

40:11.535 --> 40:12.619
It has got to stop.

40:12.786 --> 40:14.371
Well, what does that mean?

40:14.538 --> 40:16.164
It means that...

40:18.834 --> 40:21.461
that your responsibilities
are here now.

40:21.628 --> 40:23.672
So, no more voyages

40:23.839 --> 40:26.258
and no more chasing
after girls who don't exist.

40:46.444 --> 40:47.904
<i>All I ever wanted</i>

40:47.904 --> 40:50.031
<i>Was the open sea and sky</i>

40:50.198 --> 40:53.743
<i>Freedom from the life
I always knew</i>

40:53.743 --> 40:58.331
<i>Now, all I am is haunted
As days and hours roll by</i>

40:58.498 --> 41:01.334
<i>All I ever think about is you</i>

41:02.002 --> 41:04.004
<i>- There you are</i>

41:04.004 --> 41:05.797
<i>Over me</i>

41:05.964 --> 41:09.134
<i>Taking me with your song</i>

41:09.134 --> 41:13.346
<i>To wild uncharted waters</i>

41:13.722 --> 41:16.558
<i>Miles beyond the sea</i>

41:17.267 --> 41:19.102
<i>I was darkness bound</i>

41:19.269 --> 41:21.146
<i>I had almost drowned</i>

41:21.313 --> 41:25.108
<i>Till you came around
And you found me</i>

41:25.275 --> 41:29.196
<i>Now I am on the shoreline</i>

41:29.362 --> 41:33.074
<i>But I'm still lost at sea</i>

41:33.074 --> 41:37.704
<i>In these wild uncharted waters
Come find me</i>

41:38.496 --> 41:39.581
<i>Again</i>

41:45.420 --> 41:46.671
<i>All I do is wonder</i>

41:46.671 --> 41:48.882
<i>Who you are
And where you'll be</i>

41:49.049 --> 41:52.886
<i>In my mind
Your melody goes on</i>

41:53.053 --> 41:57.182
<i>Stronger than the undertow
The night you rescued me</i>

41:57.349 --> 42:00.227
<i>Silhouetted by the rising dawn</i>

42:00.602 --> 42:02.979
<i>- Oh, oh-oh</i>

42:02.979 --> 42:04.814
<i>Over you</i>

42:04.981 --> 42:08.360
<i>I cannot get over you</i>

42:08.360 --> 42:12.489
<i>In wild uncharted waters</i>

42:12.656 --> 42:15.742
<i>Beyond where man can see</i>

42:16.076 --> 42:19.829
<i>When your eyes outshine
The horizon line</i>

42:19.996 --> 42:24.042
<i>And you're finally real
Here beside me</i>

42:24.209 --> 42:27.921
<i>Now I'm right here
On the shoreline</i>

42:28.088 --> 42:31.716
<i>I'm right where you left me</i>

42:31.883 --> 42:33.677
<i>And your voice is like</i>

42:33.843 --> 42:36.096
<i>A siren that guides me</i>

42:36.263 --> 42:39.808
<i>To wild uncharted waters</i>

42:39.975 --> 42:43.353
<i>Alone, just you and me</i>

42:43.353 --> 42:47.274
<i>And I hope you're there
In the open air</i>

42:47.440 --> 42:52.237
<i>There's no map or compass
To guide me, no</i>

42:52.404 --> 42:55.323
<i>Time may change the shoreline</i>

42:55.490 --> 43:00.495
<i>But time will not change me</i>

43:01.538 --> 43:03.415
<i>If it takes my life</i>

43:03.581 --> 43:07.752
<i>I will finally find you again</i>

43:08.378 --> 43:12.299
<i>In uncharted waters</i>

43:12.465 --> 43:13.800
<i>Come find me</i>

43:14.926 --> 43:21.933
<i>Again</i>

43:39.284 --> 43:41.119
Ariel, could you
give me a hand?

43:45.206 --> 43:46.333
Ariel!

43:46.333 --> 43:48.918
Oh. Yes, of course.

43:49.085 --> 43:51.046
How do
we untangle this?

43:51.212 --> 43:53.006
Do these humans have any idea

43:53.006 --> 43:55.050
how much damage
their shipwrecks do?

43:55.216 --> 43:57.093
I don't think they intended
to have a shipwreck.

43:57.260 --> 43:58.970
They are careless, Ariel.

43:59.137 --> 44:00.638
It will take
thousands of years

44:00.638 --> 44:01.931
for this coral to grow back.

44:02.098 --> 44:04.267
And they've killed
nearly all of the sea fern.

44:04.434 --> 44:06.436
They'd kill us too,
if they had the chance.

44:06.603 --> 44:08.730
No, no.
They're not all like that.

44:08.730 --> 44:10.732
Oh? How would you know?

44:10.899 --> 44:12.567
You've never even seen one.

44:12.734 --> 44:14.402
You were just a child
when Mother died,

44:14.569 --> 44:17.113
and Father stopped us going
to the surface.

44:17.947 --> 44:19.991
I just mean,
we're not all the same,

44:19.991 --> 44:21.159
so why should humans be?

44:21.159 --> 44:22.952
What about humans?

44:23.828 --> 44:24.829
I... I just meant...

44:24.829 --> 44:26.498
Look at what
their shipwreck did.

44:28.166 --> 44:29.584
They got what they deserved.

44:30.960 --> 44:33.630
They are the most
dangerous species of all.

44:34.089 --> 44:35.340
Spoiling our waters,

44:35.340 --> 44:37.717
destroying the reefs,

44:37.884 --> 44:41.137
having no respect
for the balance of the oceans.

44:43.223 --> 44:44.265
They're not the only ones

44:44.265 --> 44:46.059
who have no respect
for balance.

44:49.104 --> 44:51.022
Ariel, where are you...

44:51.689 --> 44:53.691
What's going on with her?

44:53.858 --> 44:55.193
Oh, she's just at that age

44:55.193 --> 44:56.403
when she doesn't want
to hang out

44:56.403 --> 44:57.862
with her older sisters anymore.

44:58.029 --> 45:00.365
Exactly. You remember
what I was like.

45:00.365 --> 45:02.158
How could we forget?

45:02.158 --> 45:04.035
Well, I wonder
who the lucky merman is.

45:16.297 --> 45:18.925
The crab, Your Majesty.

45:20.510 --> 45:22.345
Come over here, Sebastian.

45:25.181 --> 45:26.474
Breathe, Sebastian.

45:26.641 --> 45:29.144
Remember,
guilty is as guilty acts.

45:29.310 --> 45:32.147
Don't overreact, remain calm.

45:38.736 --> 45:40.989
Yes, Your Majesty?

45:41.156 --> 45:42.866
Sebastian,

45:42.866 --> 45:43.950
have you noticed

45:43.950 --> 45:46.744
that Ariel has been
acting peculiar lately?

45:47.745 --> 45:49.122
Peculiar, sir?

45:49.122 --> 45:51.875
Mm-hmm.
Distracted, daydreaming,

45:52.041 --> 45:53.668
disappearing for hours.

45:54.752 --> 45:56.421
You haven't noticed?

45:56.421 --> 45:59.215
Oh... Well, I, um...

46:00.550 --> 46:02.302
- Uh...

46:02.302 --> 46:05.305
Uh, I actually haven't,
you know, um...

46:05.305 --> 46:07.182
that is to say,
I didn't, um...

46:09.976 --> 46:11.811
- Sebastian...
- Eh?

46:11.811 --> 46:14.063
I know you've been keeping
something from me.

46:14.731 --> 46:16.774
- Keepin' somethin'?
- Mm-hmm.

46:17.692 --> 46:18.985
About Ariel.

46:19.652 --> 46:20.653
Ariel?

46:29.037 --> 46:31.372
Is my little one in love?

46:33.708 --> 46:35.335
Oh, I tried to stop her, sir!

46:35.335 --> 46:36.920
I tried to stop her
from going to the surface!

46:36.920 --> 46:38.505
I told her to stay away
from humans!

46:38.505 --> 46:39.589
- Humans?
- When I saw her

46:39.589 --> 46:40.798
with that statue, I...
Humans?

46:40.798 --> 46:42.509
Who said anything
about humans?

46:46.638 --> 46:48.389
Let's just drop
these things off and go back.

46:48.389 --> 46:49.474
No way!

46:49.474 --> 46:51.142
With all that great
stuff still down there?

46:51.142 --> 46:52.352
Don't we have
enough already?

46:52.644 --> 46:53.895
Come on, Flounder.

46:53.895 --> 46:55.021
We're just getting started.

46:55.021 --> 46:56.439
So...

46:58.191 --> 47:00.068
You broke the rules?

47:01.986 --> 47:04.280
You went to the above world.

47:06.866 --> 47:08.326
There was a shipwreck.

47:09.619 --> 47:12.121
A man was drowning.
I had to save him.

47:12.288 --> 47:14.624
You should have let him drown.

47:14.791 --> 47:16.251
They're savages.

47:16.417 --> 47:17.669
You don't know that.

47:19.087 --> 47:21.464
They killed your mother.

47:22.382 --> 47:23.383
I know.

47:24.676 --> 47:25.677
But...

47:25.843 --> 47:27.262
one man did.

47:27.428 --> 47:29.472
Why blame every human?

47:29.639 --> 47:30.848
- Mother wouldn't.
- No!

47:31.015 --> 47:32.934
Enough. That's enough.

47:33.101 --> 47:35.186
And Eric had nothing
to do with it.

47:35.353 --> 47:36.646
Eric?

47:37.230 --> 47:38.648
Eric?

47:38.815 --> 47:40.817
Have you lost
your senses completely?

47:40.984 --> 47:43.027
If you would have
just heard him, Father.

47:43.194 --> 47:45.822
He's compassionate
and kind and...

47:45.989 --> 47:47.198
He's a human!

47:47.365 --> 47:48.658
- You're a mermaid!
- Yes.

47:48.825 --> 47:50.326
But that doesn't
make us enemies.

47:50.493 --> 47:52.412
Promise me you will never look
for him again.

47:53.162 --> 47:55.248
- I can't.
- Promise me, Ariel!

47:55.248 --> 47:57.292
I can't lie to you. I won't.

47:57.292 --> 47:59.294
I swear,
I will get through to you!

48:00.503 --> 48:01.504
No!

48:01.671 --> 48:02.839
Please!

48:03.840 --> 48:04.841
Father, stop.

48:05.008 --> 48:06.926
This ends now!

48:08.761 --> 48:10.346
Please, stop it!

48:10.513 --> 48:12.140
It's for your own good.

48:14.892 --> 48:16.144
Father, no!

48:44.339 --> 48:46.674
Never leave again.

49:09.364 --> 49:10.365
Ariel.

49:11.449 --> 49:12.450
I'm...

49:12.450 --> 49:13.951
Just go away.

49:32.136 --> 49:34.097
Poor child.

49:34.263 --> 49:36.307
Poor sweet child.

49:37.058 --> 49:39.519
He can be so angry.

49:40.353 --> 49:42.522
He thinks he knows everything.

49:44.315 --> 49:45.566
Who are you?

49:45.566 --> 49:48.569
Oh.
You must not remember me.

49:48.736 --> 49:51.072
I'm your Auntie Ursula.

49:52.115 --> 49:53.199
The Sea Witch?

49:53.366 --> 49:55.201
The what?

49:55.952 --> 49:58.746
What has your father
told you about me?

49:59.497 --> 50:00.540
That...

50:00.540 --> 50:02.500
That you like
to stir up trouble

50:02.500 --> 50:04.711
between humans and merpeople.

50:04.711 --> 50:07.130
Oh.
Is that what he said?

50:07.797 --> 50:11.008
I'm not half the monster
he claims I am.

50:11.175 --> 50:13.302
And I'm only here to help.

50:14.429 --> 50:16.013
I don't need your help.

50:16.889 --> 50:18.558
Whatever you say, darling.

50:24.021 --> 50:25.648
- Wait.
- Yes?

50:29.235 --> 50:30.945
How can you help me?

50:39.704 --> 50:41.372
Ariel?

50:42.123 --> 50:43.291
Where is she going

50:43.291 --> 50:45.585
with those slippery
good-for-nothin's?

50:45.752 --> 50:46.878
Let's go.

52:11.629 --> 52:12.880
Come in.

52:13.047 --> 52:14.966
Come in, child.

52:15.132 --> 52:17.927
We mustn't lurk
in passageways.

52:18.094 --> 52:19.637
It's rude.

52:20.721 --> 52:23.307
Forgive my aggressive garden.

52:23.474 --> 52:28.312
I wouldn't choose
to live like this, believe me.

52:28.479 --> 52:30.940
Daddy's been so unfair
to both of us,

52:31.107 --> 52:34.610
controlling everything
we say and do.

52:35.778 --> 52:39.198
In a way, we're the same,
you and I.

52:40.324 --> 52:43.536
You don't seem at all
like Father described you.

52:43.703 --> 52:44.954
Is that right?

52:45.621 --> 52:48.082
Mmm. We never did get along.

52:48.583 --> 52:50.501
Squidling rivalry.

52:50.668 --> 52:53.337
He always got what he wanted,
and what did I get? Nothin'.

52:53.796 --> 52:56.048
Zip, nada, squat.

52:57.300 --> 52:59.427
Sound familiar, hon?

52:59.886 --> 53:02.638
Oh, I know what you're
going through, believe me,

53:02.805 --> 53:05.558
and I know why you're here.

53:06.309 --> 53:07.685
I'm not sure I do.

53:07.852 --> 53:09.979
- Oh, please.

53:09.979 --> 53:13.816
I've been watching you
for a long time now, dearie.

53:13.983 --> 53:16.277
What you really want
is to be up there

53:16.277 --> 53:18.154
in the above world.

53:18.321 --> 53:21.115
It's always
had your curiosity,

53:21.282 --> 53:24.243
and now it's got your heart.

53:24.410 --> 53:25.745
What do you mean?

53:27.204 --> 53:28.831
You're so young.

53:29.957 --> 53:31.876
Don't you see?

53:32.043 --> 53:33.836
You're meant for each other.

53:35.379 --> 53:39.050
And I can't bear to see you
suffer like this.

53:39.216 --> 53:42.178
As it happens, I can help you.

53:43.054 --> 53:44.055
How?

53:45.348 --> 53:47.725
Mmm, the problem is simple.

53:48.726 --> 53:51.479
You can't live in that world, unless...

53:52.730 --> 53:55.399
you become a human yourself.

53:56.150 --> 53:57.485
Become human?

53:58.694 --> 53:59.904
Is that even possible?

54:00.071 --> 54:03.491
Oh, my dear.

54:03.491 --> 54:05.117
It's what I do.

54:06.619 --> 54:08.287
It's what I live for.

54:09.455 --> 54:13.167
<i>I admit that
In the past I've been a nasty</i>

54:13.334 --> 54:15.044
<i>They weren't kidding
When they called me</i>

54:15.044 --> 54:16.837
<i>Well, a witch</i>

54:17.004 --> 54:18.881
<i>But you'll find that nowadays</i>

54:19.048 --> 54:20.883
<i>I've mended all my ways</i>

54:21.050 --> 54:24.345
<i>Repented, seen the light
And made a switch</i>

54:24.512 --> 54:27.306
<i>True? Yes</i>

54:27.473 --> 54:31.894
<i>And I fortunately know
A little magic</i>

54:32.561 --> 54:36.023
<i>It's a talent that I always
Have possessed</i>

54:36.190 --> 54:38.234
<i>And here lately
Please don't laugh</i>

54:38.401 --> 54:40.236
<i>I use it on behalf</i>

54:40.403 --> 54:44.115
<i>Of the miserable, lonely
And depressed</i>

54:44.281 --> 54:46.117
<i>Pathetic</i>

54:46.283 --> 54:49.412
<i>Poor unfortunate souls</i>

54:49.578 --> 54:53.124
<i>In pain, in need</i>

54:53.124 --> 54:54.792
<i>This one longing to be thinner</i>

54:54.959 --> 54:56.502
<i>That one wants to get the girl</i>

54:56.669 --> 54:58.504
<i>And do I help them?</i>

54:58.671 --> 55:00.423
<i>Yes, indeed</i>

55:00.589 --> 55:03.801
<i>Those poor unfortunate souls</i>

55:03.968 --> 55:07.638
<i>So sad, so true</i>

55:07.805 --> 55:09.432
<i>They come flocking
To my cauldron</i>

55:09.432 --> 55:11.350
<i>Crying "Spells, Ursula, please!"</i>

55:11.350 --> 55:12.476
<i>And I help them?</i>

55:13.352 --> 55:14.478
<i>Yes, I do</i>

55:15.479 --> 55:18.441
<i>Now, it's happened
Once or twice</i>

55:18.607 --> 55:20.860
<i>Someone couldn't pay the price</i>

55:21.027 --> 55:25.364
<i>And I'm afraid I had
To rake 'em 'cross the coals</i>

55:25.865 --> 55:28.951
<i>Yes, I've had
The odd complaint</i>

55:29.118 --> 55:34.498
<i>But on the whole
I've been a saint</i>

55:35.041 --> 55:42.006
<i>To those poor
Unfortunate souls</i>

55:42.840 --> 55:44.258
- The Sea Witch!
- Shh.

55:45.468 --> 55:46.969
So, here's the deal.

55:47.136 --> 55:48.387
I'll whip up a little potion

55:48.387 --> 55:50.514
to make you human
for three days.

55:50.681 --> 55:51.682
Got that?

55:51.849 --> 55:52.850
Three days.

55:53.893 --> 55:56.187
Before the sun sets
on the third day,

55:56.187 --> 55:58.314
you and Princey
must share a kiss.

55:58.481 --> 56:00.691
And not just any kiss.

56:00.858 --> 56:02.943
The kiss of true love.

56:04.612 --> 56:09.033
If you do, you will remain
human permanently.

56:09.658 --> 56:11.243
But if you don't,

56:11.869 --> 56:15.206
you'll turn back
into a mermaid,

56:15.372 --> 56:18.292
and you belong to me.

56:18.459 --> 56:19.877
- No, Ariel!
- Shh.

56:20.961 --> 56:22.588
You understand,
of course,

56:22.588 --> 56:26.258
that you'll have to give up
your mermaid gifts.

56:26.425 --> 56:28.052
You won't have
this tail of yours,

56:28.052 --> 56:30.304
hangin' around,
draggin' you down.

56:31.055 --> 56:33.933
You won't be able to breathe
underwater, who needs it?

56:36.227 --> 56:39.188
And you'll no longer have
that siren song of yours,

56:39.355 --> 56:42.608
because that wouldn't be fair,
now would it?

56:43.275 --> 56:44.610
Don't worry.

56:44.777 --> 56:48.739
I'll keep it safe
and soundless here with me.

56:50.366 --> 56:51.700
We got a deal?

56:54.745 --> 56:56.080
I don't know.

56:56.580 --> 56:57.998
Well...

56:58.165 --> 57:00.668
I mean, I just gave you
the premium package, kid.

57:00.668 --> 57:01.752
Well...

57:04.088 --> 57:07.508
life's full of tough choices,
idn't?

57:11.011 --> 57:12.263
No.

57:12.429 --> 57:14.056
This is wrong.
I can't do this.

57:15.516 --> 57:18.477
Fine then,
forget about the world above.

57:18.644 --> 57:21.147
Go back home to Daddy

57:21.313 --> 57:23.899
- and "Never leave again!"

57:23.899 --> 57:27.945
<i>Come on
You poor unfortunate soul!</i>

57:28.112 --> 57:29.280
<i>Go ahead</i>

57:29.446 --> 57:31.157
<i>Make your choice</i>

57:31.323 --> 57:32.950
<i>I'm a very busy woman</i>

57:32.950 --> 57:34.535
<i>And I haven't got all day</i>

57:34.702 --> 57:37.538
<i>It won't cost much
Just your voice</i>

57:38.581 --> 57:41.542
<i>You poor unfortunate soul</i>

57:41.709 --> 57:44.962
<i>It's sad, but true</i>

57:45.129 --> 57:46.839
<i>If you want to cross
The bridge, my sweet</i>

57:46.839 --> 57:48.215
<i>You've got to pay the toll</i>

57:48.382 --> 57:49.925
<i>Pluck a scale
From off your tail</i>

57:50.092 --> 57:51.635
<i>A drop of blood
Inside the bowl!</i>

57:51.802 --> 57:53.679
<i>Flotsam, Jetsam
Now I've got her, boys</i>

57:53.846 --> 57:57.349
<i>For boss is on a roll!</i>

57:58.809 --> 58:02.438
<i>This poor unfortunate...</i>

58:03.522 --> 58:09.153
<i>Soul!</i>

58:11.572 --> 58:16.869
<i>Beluga! Sevruga!
Come winds of the Caspian Sea!</i>

58:18.746 --> 58:22.291
<i>Amnesia, glossitis
Et max laryngitis</i>

58:22.458 --> 58:25.586
<i>La voce to me!</i>

58:26.170 --> 58:28.714
Now sing!

58:37.473 --> 58:39.266
Keep singing!

58:51.779 --> 58:53.239
Whoa!

58:58.953 --> 59:00.037
Yes!

59:00.829 --> 59:02.831
Yes!

59:07.002 --> 59:09.797
Look at her stupid
little feet!

59:30.985 --> 59:32.278
Oh, Ariel.

59:33.737 --> 59:36.115
Well, come on, gal.

59:36.282 --> 59:37.825
It's either sink or swim.

59:48.836 --> 59:50.170
Don't worry, boys.

59:50.879 --> 59:54.633
She doesn't stand a chance
without this.

59:54.800 --> 59:57.261
A mermaid without her voice?

59:59.805 --> 01:00:01.265
And just in case,

01:00:01.432 --> 01:00:05.311
I slipped a little somethin'
extra into that spell of mine.

01:00:05.978 --> 01:00:08.981
No matter how hard
that girl tries,

01:00:09.148 --> 01:00:13.235
she won't remember
she needs to get that kiss.

01:00:13.402 --> 01:00:15.654
Now it's just a matter
of time.

01:00:17.489 --> 01:00:18.991
And then she's mine.

01:00:18.991 --> 01:00:21.535
- Hmm.

01:00:26.790 --> 01:00:29.251
Not so easy
without your tail, is it?

01:00:30.836 --> 01:00:31.837
Keep going.

01:00:32.004 --> 01:00:33.589
You just got
to get your sea legs.

01:00:34.715 --> 01:00:36.592
- We're almost there.

01:00:45.309 --> 01:00:46.352
Get away from here!

01:00:47.895 --> 01:00:49.563
Lord have mercy.

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:53.233
Are you all right?

01:00:56.362 --> 01:00:57.905
Ah, poor girl.

01:00:58.072 --> 01:00:59.323
You must be in shock.

01:01:00.741 --> 01:01:02.451
I'll go find something
to cover you up.

01:01:03.285 --> 01:01:04.912
Another shipwreck.

01:01:05.079 --> 01:01:07.247
<i>Santa Maria.</i>

01:01:27.518 --> 01:01:29.144
Say, what's goin' on, kid?

01:01:29.353 --> 01:01:30.729
I thought you weren't supposed
to be up here,

01:01:30.729 --> 01:01:31.814
now you're taking boat rides?

01:01:31.814 --> 01:01:33.607
That... That...
That rotten Sea Witch,

01:01:33.607 --> 01:01:34.775
she stole Ariel's voice.

01:01:34.775 --> 01:01:36.193
Hey, Flounder.

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:37.569
What... What are you
talkin' about?

01:01:37.736 --> 01:01:39.863
So, Sebastian told Triton
that Ariel saved a human

01:01:40.030 --> 01:01:41.281
- and Triton got so mad.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:01:41.281 --> 01:01:42.950
- And then... Wait!
- Explanations later, man.

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:44.034
We've gotta get you
out of here.

01:01:44.034 --> 01:01:45.786
Wait! I didn't tell you
about the Sea Witch!

01:01:45.786 --> 01:01:48.872
Bye-bye. And don't tell anyone
about the Sea Witch!

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:53.043
Something about you
seems different.

01:01:53.210 --> 01:01:54.336
Don't tell me.

01:01:54.503 --> 01:01:56.463
It's your hairdo, right?

01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:58.048
'Cause you've been using
the dinglehopper? No?

01:01:58.924 --> 01:02:01.969
I can't... I can't
quite figure it out,

01:02:02.803 --> 01:02:05.013
but I know that if I stand
here for long enough...

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:07.516
She got legs, ya idiot!

01:02:07.683 --> 01:02:09.226
You know,
we've discussed this.

01:02:09.226 --> 01:02:10.936
I don't like it
when you call me an idiot.

01:02:11.103 --> 01:02:12.271
Why don't you tell me
somethin' nice?

01:02:12.271 --> 01:02:13.355
"Hey, Scuttle.

01:02:13.355 --> 01:02:14.606
-"Your feathers look good."
Shoo!

01:02:14.606 --> 01:02:16.733
- Here you are.

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:18.902
It'll have to do for now.

01:02:19.069 --> 01:02:20.737
I'll take you to the castle.

01:02:20.904 --> 01:02:22.448
They'll know what
to do with you there.

01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:24.867
Come on, in ya go.

01:02:32.207 --> 01:02:34.334
Good catch today.
It looks good, though.

01:02:34.334 --> 01:02:36.003
It looks raw.

01:02:37.754 --> 01:02:38.839
You're not done yet?

01:02:39.006 --> 01:02:40.757
His looks so good!

01:02:40.924 --> 01:02:42.342
I must say a parrie fish.

01:02:42.509 --> 01:02:44.219
Got plenty of fish
for two weeks.

01:02:46.555 --> 01:02:47.556
Hey!

01:02:47.556 --> 01:02:49.516
<i>Look at the sun and the sky</i>

01:02:49.516 --> 01:02:52.853
<i>And the sand and the sea
Behind me</i>

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:56.315
<i>Look at me, suddenly I am
On land and I'm free</i>

01:02:56.482 --> 01:03:01.111
<i>Don't mind me as I climb
For the first time</i>

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:03.655
<i>Jump for the first time</i>

01:03:03.822 --> 01:03:04.823
<i>Trying to stand</i>

01:03:04.823 --> 01:03:06.658
<i>But this gravity's
Pulling me down</i>

01:03:12.581 --> 01:03:13.624
Walk on, Emile.

01:03:14.750 --> 01:03:15.876
Trot on!

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:19.922
Trot on!

01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:21.215
Get Lashana, quick!

01:03:21.381 --> 01:03:22.508
Right-o!

01:03:25.469 --> 01:03:26.887
What is all this?

01:03:27.054 --> 01:03:28.430
What on Earth?

01:03:28.597 --> 01:03:30.390
The girl got tangled
in the net.

01:03:31.642 --> 01:03:33.685
- She all right?
- She'll survive.

01:03:33.852 --> 01:03:35.145
But she's been
through it, though.

01:03:35.145 --> 01:03:36.313
Won't say a word.

01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.315
I wonder what happened
to her out there.

01:03:38.315 --> 01:03:39.483
<i>Look, it's a fire</i>

01:03:39.483 --> 01:03:40.776
<i>It's warm and it glows</i>

01:03:40.776 --> 01:03:43.612
<i>And it lights this chamber</i>

01:03:43.779 --> 01:03:45.489
<i>Let me admire it
Ow!</i>

01:03:45.489 --> 01:03:47.074
<i>Get too close and it bites</i>

01:03:47.241 --> 01:03:51.703
<i>I came too close
For the first time</i>

01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:54.373
<i>Burned for the first time</i>

01:03:54.540 --> 01:03:57.042
<i>Everything's clearer
And brighter and hotter</i>

01:03:57.209 --> 01:03:59.628
<i>But now that I'm here
Like a fish out of water</i>

01:03:59.628 --> 01:04:00.796
<i>I'm trying to stand</i>

01:04:00.796 --> 01:04:03.298
<i>But this gravity's
Pulling me down</i>

01:04:03.298 --> 01:04:05.592
Oh, my! Heavens.

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:07.761
Here, let me
take you upstairs,

01:04:07.928 --> 01:04:10.514
get you cleaned up,
find you some clothes.

01:04:11.682 --> 01:04:14.184
Okay, up we go,

01:04:15.102 --> 01:04:17.854
one step at a time.

01:04:20.482 --> 01:04:21.817
She can't speak at all?

01:04:21.984 --> 01:04:23.819
Can you blame her, Rosa?

01:04:23.986 --> 01:04:25.779
After all she's been through,

01:04:25.946 --> 01:04:27.990
it's a blessing
she's not worse off.

01:04:28.156 --> 01:04:30.033
Such a faraway look
in her eye.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.161
Bit of a soap and a scrub,
she'll be good as new.

01:04:34.580 --> 01:04:36.999
<i>Are we only</i>

01:04:36.999 --> 01:04:40.043
<i>Food for slaughter?</i>

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:43.046
<i>Is this life on land?</i>

01:04:43.213 --> 01:04:45.090
Child, the blue dress
that's in your room.

01:04:45.257 --> 01:04:50.387
<i>Well, you were lonely
Under water</i>

01:04:50.554 --> 01:04:53.390
<i>Come on, Ariel, time to stand</i>

01:04:54.975 --> 01:04:58.228
There you go.
Smells nice, doesn't it?

01:04:58.395 --> 01:04:59.563
Oh, no, you poor girl.

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:01.231
You must be starvin'.

01:05:01.398 --> 01:05:03.066
Rosa, get this poor child
some food.

01:05:03.233 --> 01:05:05.569
And quick, before she tries
to eat the scrub brush.

01:05:05.736 --> 01:05:07.446
- Yes, ma'am.
- Right.

01:05:07.613 --> 01:05:10.699
Let's get that seaweed stink
off you, girl.

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:12.326
Yes.

01:05:21.335 --> 01:05:22.336
<i>Squeeze in the shoes</i>

01:05:22.336 --> 01:05:23.545
<i>And the corset, it's tight</i>

01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:26.715
<i>- And the seams are busting</i>

01:05:26.882 --> 01:05:28.800
<i>Some women choose this
I guess it's all right</i>

01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:31.136
<i>Are my dreams adjusting</i>

01:05:31.136 --> 01:05:32.304
Hard to believe,

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:34.765
two shipwrecks in one week.

01:05:34.931 --> 01:05:37.726
Prince Eric's still looking
for that girl who saved him.

01:05:37.893 --> 01:05:39.603
Said he won't rest
until he finds her.

01:05:42.773 --> 01:05:44.816
Stay right there.
I'll get the Prince.

01:05:46.234 --> 01:05:49.196
<i>As I wait for the first time</i>

01:05:49.363 --> 01:05:51.740
<i>Here for the first time</i>

01:05:51.907 --> 01:05:54.534
<i>Now, for the first time</i>

01:05:54.701 --> 01:06:01.541
<i>He's coming
Through those doors</i>

01:06:01.917 --> 01:06:07.255
<i>Up the stairs</i>

01:06:07.255 --> 01:06:12.469
<i>From the shore</i>

01:06:12.469 --> 01:06:17.808
<i>From that moment</i>

01:06:17.974 --> 01:06:20.352
<i>And he'll smile</i>

01:06:20.519 --> 01:06:23.146
<i>Like he knows</i>

01:06:23.146 --> 01:06:25.565
<i>When I say</i>

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:32.155
I'm so sorry to hear
what happened.

01:06:32.322 --> 01:06:33.907
What's your name?

01:06:34.241 --> 01:06:35.742
She doesn't speak, sire.

01:06:38.203 --> 01:06:39.204
She...

01:06:40.288 --> 01:06:41.289
Oh.

01:06:44.584 --> 01:06:46.586
Well, we're glad
you've made it to us.

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:49.715
Do you have a place to stay?

01:06:49.881 --> 01:06:50.882
Family?

01:06:52.759 --> 01:06:54.720
Well, then you're welcome
to stay here.

01:06:55.387 --> 01:06:56.596
For as long as you like.

01:06:58.056 --> 01:06:59.474
Make sure she has anything
she needs.

01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:00.726
Yes, Your Highness.

01:07:12.320 --> 01:07:14.072
We should let you
get some rest.

01:07:23.415 --> 01:07:26.084
<i>Realize
The price that you paid</i>

01:07:26.084 --> 01:07:27.502
<i>With your voice</i>

01:07:27.669 --> 01:07:30.881
<i>As he turns from you</i>

01:07:32.507 --> 01:07:35.093
<i>Those sacrifices you made</i>

01:07:35.093 --> 01:07:39.264
<i>Were a choice
That you can't undo</i>

01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:42.017
<i>Lost</i>

01:07:42.184 --> 01:07:44.519
<i>For the first time</i>

01:07:44.686 --> 01:07:46.313
<i>Scared</i>

01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.690
<i>For the first time</i>

01:07:49.816 --> 01:07:54.446
<i>Gravity feels like an undertow</i>

01:07:54.446 --> 01:07:56.865
<i>Pulling me</i>

01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:01.036
<i>Down</i>

01:08:08.168 --> 01:08:11.213
This has got to be,
without a doubt,

01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:14.800
the single most humiliating
day of my life!

01:08:15.675 --> 01:08:17.302
I could have been fricasseed,

01:08:17.302 --> 01:08:21.264
and then, having to climb
all the way up here.

01:08:21.431 --> 01:08:23.600
They couldn't give you a room
on the ground floor?

01:08:25.393 --> 01:08:27.020
I hope you appreciate

01:08:27.020 --> 01:08:29.731
what I go through
for you, young lady.

01:08:29.731 --> 01:08:30.857
Eh, no.

01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:32.609
Don't ya turn your back on me.

01:08:32.776 --> 01:08:33.944
What were you thinkin',

01:08:33.944 --> 01:08:37.030
choosin' to give up
your mermaid gifts?

01:08:37.197 --> 01:08:39.908
Now, if we could just get
that witch to give them back,

01:08:40.075 --> 01:08:42.702
then you could go home
and just be...

01:08:42.702 --> 01:08:44.412
uh, well, and just be...

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:49.835
just be miserable
for the rest of your life.

01:08:51.127 --> 01:08:53.922
Oh, my, what a soft shell
I am turnin' out to be.

01:08:54.923 --> 01:08:57.259
All right. All right.

01:08:57.259 --> 01:08:59.052
I'll try to help you.

01:08:59.219 --> 01:09:01.179
But we've got to be bold,
act quickly.

01:09:01.346 --> 01:09:03.014
Don't forget about the kiss.

01:09:04.099 --> 01:09:05.809
Ah, no, no, not me,
the Prince!

01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:07.143
You gotta kiss the Prince.

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:08.353
Don't you remember?

01:09:08.353 --> 01:09:09.980
You only have three days to...

01:09:10.981 --> 01:09:12.357
Hello?

01:09:13.191 --> 01:09:14.901
Oh, no!

01:09:15.068 --> 01:09:17.070
- She's put a spell on you.

01:09:17.070 --> 01:09:19.197
You can't remember, can you?

01:09:19.197 --> 01:09:21.116
Now,
what are we gonna do?

01:09:22.075 --> 01:09:23.785
Well, we got no time to lose.

01:09:23.952 --> 01:09:25.537
We just got to find a way

01:09:25.537 --> 01:09:27.372
to get the two
of you together.

01:09:31.293 --> 01:09:33.837
You are hopeless, child.

01:09:34.004 --> 01:09:35.005
You know that?

01:09:36.548 --> 01:09:38.091
Completely hopeless.

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:49.477
Ooh. A buffet.

01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:53.732
- What? No nuts?

01:09:53.899 --> 01:09:55.066
What are you doin' here?

01:09:55.233 --> 01:09:57.652
Oh, there you are.
I've been lookin' for you.

01:09:57.652 --> 01:09:59.487
Flounder told me
the whole story.

01:09:59.654 --> 01:10:01.281
Has Ariel killed
the Prince yet?

01:10:01.281 --> 01:10:02.908
No, not "killed."

01:10:03.074 --> 01:10:04.701
"Kissed," ya bird brain.

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:06.202
And it's worse
than we thought.

01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:07.913
The witch has placed
a spell on her.

01:10:07.913 --> 01:10:09.789
Soon as I tell her
she's got to kiss him,

01:10:09.789 --> 01:10:12.208
the thought jumps clear
right out of her head.

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:13.418
So, now it's up to us.

01:10:13.418 --> 01:10:14.794
To kiss the Prince?

01:10:14.794 --> 01:10:16.254
Forget it.

01:10:16.254 --> 01:10:17.714
Where's Ariel now?

01:10:17.881 --> 01:10:19.299
What do ya mean?
She's right...

01:10:22.010 --> 01:10:23.011
Oh.

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:26.718
What are you doin'
in here, child?

01:12:26.885 --> 01:12:29.846
You can't just go wanderin'
around wherever you please.

01:12:29.846 --> 01:12:31.765
- Hide!
Who's in here?

01:12:40.482 --> 01:12:41.524
Oh, it's you.

01:12:47.781 --> 01:12:49.199
Nobody usually comes in here.

01:12:53.078 --> 01:12:54.871
- My little mermaid.

01:12:56.331 --> 01:12:58.249
It's all right,
it's all right.

01:12:58.416 --> 01:12:59.834
You can look at it.

01:13:00.001 --> 01:13:02.128
I found her on the coast
of Cartagena.

01:13:03.338 --> 01:13:04.506
Isn't she beautiful?

01:13:07.759 --> 01:13:09.177
Oh, that's right. You...

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:13.515
Well, it really
doesn't matter.

01:13:14.474 --> 01:13:16.059
Most people around here
use too many words

01:13:16.059 --> 01:13:17.227
and have nothing to say.

01:13:18.937 --> 01:13:19.938
You know,

01:13:20.730 --> 01:13:22.232
I never believed all that lore

01:13:22.232 --> 01:13:25.568
about mermaids luring
sailors to their deaths.

01:13:28.029 --> 01:13:29.447
Here, take her.

01:13:31.074 --> 01:13:32.617
No, really.
I want you to have her.

01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:35.495
I'm running out of space
as it is.

01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:39.082
Nearly all of these things
come from my voyages.

01:13:40.041 --> 01:13:42.585
I know it must seem silly,
collecting all this stuff,

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:45.797
but just look
at this fossilized sea stone.

01:13:45.964 --> 01:13:47.549
Can you believe
that such amazing things

01:13:47.549 --> 01:13:48.633
exist down there?

01:13:52.512 --> 01:13:53.513
No, wait!

01:14:01.813 --> 01:14:03.314
How did you know
that was in there...

01:14:05.358 --> 01:14:06.359
all this time?

01:14:08.862 --> 01:14:09.904
That's incredible.

01:14:11.781 --> 01:14:13.032
- Well, that.
Hey, girl.

01:14:13.199 --> 01:14:15.743
That I just picked up from
the beach here on the island.

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:18.913
There's loads of them
at this time of year.

01:14:26.171 --> 01:14:27.964
I had no idea
you could do that.

01:14:29.924 --> 01:14:31.092
Oh, me?

01:14:31.843 --> 01:14:32.844
No... Oh.

01:14:33.428 --> 01:14:34.429
Really?

01:14:34.596 --> 01:14:35.847
All right, hand...

01:14:37.223 --> 01:14:38.266
How do I...

01:14:39.434 --> 01:14:40.935
Yeah, that's it.

01:14:40.935 --> 01:14:42.270
That's it, girl.

01:14:42.270 --> 01:14:43.813
- Go get it, go get it.

01:14:43.813 --> 01:14:44.898
I see ya.

01:14:44.898 --> 01:14:47.066
Go on, come now...

01:14:50.737 --> 01:14:53.072
Sorry.

01:14:53.615 --> 01:14:54.616
Yeah, well...

01:14:56.242 --> 01:14:57.243
I'll work on that.

01:14:58.912 --> 01:15:00.038
I love the people there.

01:15:00.038 --> 01:15:02.540
Their culture, their custom.

01:15:02.707 --> 01:15:05.752
This whole region is known
as the Brazilian Empire.

01:15:05.919 --> 01:15:08.213
Then there's Venezuela,

01:15:09.047 --> 01:15:11.174
uh, Colombia...

01:15:11.966 --> 01:15:14.636
Oh, the area up here
is called Mosquito Coast.

01:15:17.847 --> 01:15:19.724
Those waters
are all uncharted.

01:15:21.184 --> 01:15:23.019
Wouldn't it be amazing
to discover someplace

01:15:23.019 --> 01:15:24.520
no one's ever seen before?

01:15:29.025 --> 01:15:30.693
Ah. Well, this...

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.987
this was one
of my favorite voyages.

01:15:33.988 --> 01:15:35.531
I bought
that Peruvian rug there,

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:37.909
along with six of the looms
they used to make it.

01:15:37.909 --> 01:15:38.993
Oh.

01:15:39.327 --> 01:15:40.912
Another one.
All right.

01:15:42.413 --> 01:15:45.541
Ah. This is our island.

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:48.002
We're in that very castle
right now.

01:15:48.836 --> 01:15:51.130
Over here's our main village.

01:15:51.297 --> 01:15:54.133
Now, our port there was once
the busiest in the region.

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.428
I'm hoping it will be again
one day.

01:15:59.389 --> 01:16:00.765
And there's a beautiful lagoon

01:16:00.765 --> 01:16:02.684
with a little waterfall
right here.

01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:05.395
And then all of that
is rainforest.

01:16:06.688 --> 01:16:09.357
I could show you around,
if you like.

01:16:10.817 --> 01:16:12.402
All right.

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:14.404
- We'll go tomorrow.
But, sire...

01:16:14.404 --> 01:16:16.322
Oh, Grimsby, good.

01:16:16.322 --> 01:16:17.573
We'll need a horse
and carriage

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:18.658
ready for us in the morning.

01:16:19.284 --> 01:16:21.536
May I have a quiet word, sire?

01:16:23.413 --> 01:16:24.414
Of course.

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:29.210
He's a special one, isn't he?

01:16:29.377 --> 01:16:30.878
And that moonlight. Ah...

01:16:34.299 --> 01:16:37.010
We were going to send out
all the carriages tomorrow

01:16:37.010 --> 01:16:38.219
to look for the girl.

01:16:38.219 --> 01:16:40.305
The girl! I wasn't thinking.

01:16:40.471 --> 01:16:42.807
Of course, yes,
we must do that. Absolutely.

01:16:42.807 --> 01:16:44.684
And I must remind you, Eric,

01:16:44.851 --> 01:16:45.935
what your mother
said yesterday

01:16:45.935 --> 01:16:47.603
about you not leaving
the castle

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:50.148
- until you're feeling better.
- Grimsby, I feel fine.

01:16:50.315 --> 01:16:52.025
I feel better than ever.

01:16:52.859 --> 01:16:53.860
Yes.

01:16:55.153 --> 01:16:56.404
Yes, I can see that.

01:16:58.156 --> 01:17:02.076
I suppose we could spare
one carriage.

01:17:25.725 --> 01:17:27.769
Looks like
you made a friend there.

01:17:28.102 --> 01:17:29.479
Come on, Max.

01:17:29.645 --> 01:17:30.897
We'll see you later.

01:17:30.897 --> 01:17:32.857
Oh, no.
You're not goin' without me.

01:17:33.024 --> 01:17:34.692
I only got two days left.

01:17:34.692 --> 01:17:35.943
I'm a crab on a mission.

01:17:35.943 --> 01:17:37.779
Trot on, King.

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:44.744
- I'm getting too old for this.

01:17:44.744 --> 01:17:46.621
Oh, no, no, no! Down, beast!

01:17:48.247 --> 01:17:49.332
Whoa!

01:17:51.459 --> 01:17:53.252
I still got it.

01:17:57.673 --> 01:18:00.134
Who is that ridin' out
with Prince Eric?

01:18:00.301 --> 01:18:02.095
Is that the girl who washed up
the other day?

01:18:02.261 --> 01:18:03.679
Yes, it is, Lashana.

01:18:04.847 --> 01:18:07.100
Didn't the Queen tell him
to stay in the castle?

01:18:07.266 --> 01:18:08.601
Yes, she did, Lashana.

01:18:08.768 --> 01:18:10.269
Aren't you going
to get into trouble

01:18:10.269 --> 01:18:11.729
for fetching him a carriage?

01:18:11.896 --> 01:18:13.398
What carriage, Lashana?

01:18:37.588 --> 01:18:38.589
Oh.

01:18:39.006 --> 01:18:40.007
Do you wanna try?

01:18:41.634 --> 01:18:42.635
Here.

01:18:43.928 --> 01:18:44.929
Oh!

01:18:49.559 --> 01:18:51.853
Um...

01:18:55.648 --> 01:18:56.983
Look out! Look out!

01:18:57.817 --> 01:18:59.360
Come on! Move, move, move!

01:19:03.114 --> 01:19:05.908
Sorry about that!

01:19:08.119 --> 01:19:09.579
That was close.

01:19:09.579 --> 01:19:10.663
Whoa!

01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:12.248
Hey, guys!
Get out the way!

01:19:13.499 --> 01:19:14.709
- Turn!
Quickly!

01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:15.793
Wait, wait, wait!

01:19:16.961 --> 01:19:17.962
Careful!

01:19:31.601 --> 01:19:32.894
Oh!

01:19:33.519 --> 01:19:34.645
That was...

01:19:34.812 --> 01:19:36.022
fun.

01:19:36.189 --> 01:19:37.315
Here, I'll...

01:19:39.901 --> 01:19:40.902
Let me give you a hand.

01:19:41.611 --> 01:19:42.653
Move, move 'em.

01:19:42.653 --> 01:19:43.863
Here we go. This way.

01:19:43.863 --> 01:19:45.490
Come on. This way.

01:19:46.115 --> 01:19:48.326
Here we go.

01:19:48.493 --> 01:19:49.535
Go on. That's it.

01:19:50.828 --> 01:19:51.913
Thank you, lad.

01:20:11.349 --> 01:20:12.600
Island berry?

01:20:12.767 --> 01:20:14.352
How is it? Pretty?

01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:17.146
- Whoa!
Coconut!

01:20:17.146 --> 01:20:18.731
Breadfruit!
Coconut!

01:20:20.983 --> 01:20:21.984
Fresh coconut?

01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:25.321
No? You don't want it?

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:27.156
Get some water in ya.

01:20:29.325 --> 01:20:30.701
Thank you, Miss.
Young lady,

01:20:30.701 --> 01:20:32.245
would you like to try some?

01:20:35.039 --> 01:20:36.040
Oh!

01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:37.959
I think you'll be
needing this.

01:20:53.683 --> 01:20:55.393
Hey,
can I have some salt?

01:20:56.352 --> 01:20:57.895
Good day, sire.

01:20:58.771 --> 01:21:00.439
How ripe the mango?

01:21:00.606 --> 01:21:01.857
Hat for the lady?

01:21:04.569 --> 01:21:06.153
Oh.  There you are.

01:21:08.114 --> 01:21:10.783
- Oh.
- No, no. Too big.

01:21:10.950 --> 01:21:11.951
Try this.

01:21:18.457 --> 01:21:19.959
Tropical flowers?

01:21:58.122 --> 01:22:00.124
Hey!
Everybody, everybody!

01:22:00.124 --> 01:22:01.626
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:22:01.626 --> 01:22:02.877
Hey!

01:22:07.173 --> 01:22:09.258
Say, any kissing yet?

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:13.137
No. When it comes to romance,
these two are slow as snails.

01:22:13.304 --> 01:22:14.805
Hey, go find Flounder.

01:22:14.805 --> 01:22:17.058
We got to move
this thing along, and quick.

01:22:17.224 --> 01:22:18.726
Okay, bossy.

01:22:22.605 --> 01:22:24.649
Hey!

01:22:24.649 --> 01:22:25.900
Hey!

01:22:27.902 --> 01:22:29.945
Bring it here, bring it here,
bring it here now!

01:22:29.945 --> 01:22:31.697
Back it up, back it up,
back it up!

01:22:36.702 --> 01:22:38.037
Come on, now!

01:22:54.595 --> 01:22:56.055
I love this time of night.

01:22:57.556 --> 01:23:00.393
Sometimes you'll see the eyes
of a screech owl,

01:23:00.393 --> 01:23:01.477
up in the tree...

01:23:01.477 --> 01:23:03.020
- Hey! Hey!

01:23:03.020 --> 01:23:04.438
Hey, come back with that!

01:23:05.106 --> 01:23:06.107
Come on.

01:23:07.692 --> 01:23:08.818
Watch out.

01:23:09.735 --> 01:23:10.861
I think it went this way.

01:23:11.028 --> 01:23:13.072
You all right?  Hey!

01:23:14.031 --> 01:23:15.574
Give me my hat back!

01:23:21.288 --> 01:23:24.041
Oh. All right then.

01:23:27.253 --> 01:23:29.171
I didn't want to lose this.

01:23:45.020 --> 01:23:47.022
Move
your big fat feathers, bird.

01:23:47.022 --> 01:23:48.190
I can't see a thing.

01:23:48.190 --> 01:23:49.525
Well, that worked pretty good,
didn't it?

01:23:49.525 --> 01:23:50.901
- But nothing's happening.

01:23:50.901 --> 01:23:53.320
We're running out of time,
and no one's puckered up once.

01:23:53.487 --> 01:23:55.406
I think it's time for a little

01:23:55.573 --> 01:23:57.992
vocal romantic stimulation.

01:23:59.535 --> 01:24:00.619
Please, no.

01:24:00.619 --> 01:24:02.538
- Scuttle? You got to be...
-  <i>Me, me, me</i>

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:03.914
<i>- Womp chicka womp womp</i>

01:24:03.914 --> 01:24:05.207
<i>- Chicka womp womp</i>
Shh!

01:24:05.207 --> 01:24:06.292
<i>Chicka womp</i>

01:24:08.294 --> 01:24:09.670
<i>Womp womp</i>

01:24:09.670 --> 01:24:10.838
- All right. Gosh.
<i>- Womp</i>

01:24:10.838 --> 01:24:11.964
I was off.
I was off on that one.

01:24:11.964 --> 01:24:13.048
- No.
<i>- Womp</i>

01:24:13.048 --> 01:24:14.133
Let me find it.
Let me find it.

01:24:14.133 --> 01:24:16.010
<i>- Womp</i>
- Ya finish?

01:24:16.177 --> 01:24:17.178
<i>Womp</i>

01:24:17.178 --> 01:24:18.596
All right, all right. Listen.

01:24:18.763 --> 01:24:20.556
Ariel cannot know
we're helpin'.

01:24:20.723 --> 01:24:22.892
If she sees or hears us,
she'll shut us down.

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:25.519
Nah, man. We got
to be sneaky about this.

01:24:25.686 --> 01:24:27.438
We got to work on the Prince

01:24:27.438 --> 01:24:29.440
using the power of suggestion.

01:24:29.440 --> 01:24:30.524
Good.

01:24:31.400 --> 01:24:32.985
How are we gonna do that?

01:24:33.152 --> 01:24:35.529
We got to blend in
with the sounds of nature,

01:24:35.529 --> 01:24:36.989
so she doesn't hear us.

01:24:38.032 --> 01:24:39.074
Percussion.

01:24:45.664 --> 01:24:47.082
Strings.

01:24:51.378 --> 01:24:52.546
Winds.

01:24:57.718 --> 01:24:59.512
Words.

01:24:59.678 --> 01:25:02.681
<i>There you see her</i>

01:25:02.848 --> 01:25:05.935
<i>Sitting there across the way</i>

01:25:06.352 --> 01:25:08.437
<i>She don't got a lot to say</i>

01:25:08.437 --> 01:25:11.607
<i>But there's something
About her</i>

01:25:13.359 --> 01:25:15.069
<i>And you don't know why</i>

01:25:15.069 --> 01:25:16.779
<i>But you're dying to try</i>

01:25:16.779 --> 01:25:19.323
<i>You wanna kiss the girl</i>

01:25:23.369 --> 01:25:26.455
<i>Yes, you want her</i>

01:25:26.622 --> 01:25:28.874
<i>Look at her, you know you do</i>

01:25:30.376 --> 01:25:32.253
<i>Possible she wants you, too</i>

01:25:32.253 --> 01:25:35.214
<i>Use your words, boy
And ask her</i>

01:25:35.214 --> 01:25:36.298
Do you want to try?

01:25:37.007 --> 01:25:38.676
<i>If the time is right</i>

01:25:38.843 --> 01:25:40.636
<i>Then the time is tonight</i>

01:25:40.803 --> 01:25:42.805
<i>- Go on and kiss the girl</i>

01:25:49.395 --> 01:25:51.480
<i>Sha la la la la la, my oh, my</i>

01:25:51.647 --> 01:25:53.482
<i>Look like the boy too shy</i>

01:25:53.649 --> 01:25:55.901
<i>Ain't gonna kiss the girl</i>

01:25:56.402 --> 01:25:57.695
<i>Sha la la la la la</i>

01:25:57.695 --> 01:25:58.904
<i>Ain't that sad</i>

01:25:58.904 --> 01:26:00.698
<i>Ain't it a shame, too bad</i>

01:26:00.698 --> 01:26:02.449
<i>- He's gonna miss the girl</i>

01:26:02.449 --> 01:26:03.534
Hey, pull it back.

01:26:03.534 --> 01:26:04.994
- Scuttle, pull it back.

01:26:11.333 --> 01:26:12.459
What a clear night.

01:26:14.003 --> 01:26:15.129
You can see Orion.

01:26:17.047 --> 01:26:20.259
Oh, the... The sailors use the
constellations to navigate.

01:26:21.802 --> 01:26:23.637
That one's Orion, the hunter.

01:26:25.890 --> 01:26:28.434
There's Aries, the ram.

01:26:30.477 --> 01:26:31.979
That's Cassiopeia.

01:26:33.272 --> 01:26:34.440
That's funny.

01:26:34.440 --> 01:26:36.650
I still don't know your name.

01:26:38.402 --> 01:26:41.030
Let's see. Is it...

01:26:41.864 --> 01:26:43.032
Diana?

01:26:44.283 --> 01:26:45.284
No?

01:26:46.535 --> 01:26:47.828
Or...

01:26:48.746 --> 01:26:50.080
Katherine?

01:26:51.040 --> 01:26:53.500
No, definitely not Katherine.

01:26:55.002 --> 01:26:56.337
How...

01:26:59.924 --> 01:27:01.508
Sky...

01:27:01.508 --> 01:27:02.718
Uh...

01:27:06.847 --> 01:27:07.848
Aries?

01:27:08.891 --> 01:27:09.892
Aries.

01:27:10.976 --> 01:27:11.977
Arie...

01:27:13.437 --> 01:27:14.438
Ari-el.

01:27:16.106 --> 01:27:17.149
Ariel?

01:27:18.317 --> 01:27:20.069
Ari-el?

01:27:21.779 --> 01:27:22.988
Ariel.

01:27:25.866 --> 01:27:27.326
That's a beautiful name.

01:27:32.373 --> 01:27:33.666
Written in the stars.

01:27:40.089 --> 01:27:42.174
<i>Now's your moment</i>

01:27:42.174 --> 01:27:45.761
<i>- Ooh, ooh-ooh
- Floating in a blue lagoon</i>

01:27:46.095 --> 01:27:48.973
<i>- Ooh-ooh, boy, do it soon
- Boy, you better do it soon</i>

01:27:49.139 --> 01:27:52.685
<i>No time will be better</i>

01:27:53.644 --> 01:27:55.396
<i>She don't say a word</i>

01:27:55.562 --> 01:27:58.190
<i>And she won't say a word
Until you</i>

01:27:58.357 --> 01:27:59.858
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

01:28:00.025 --> 01:28:01.735
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

01:28:01.902 --> 01:28:04.571
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

01:28:05.948 --> 01:28:07.032
<i>Sha la la la la</i>

01:28:07.032 --> 01:28:08.158
<i>Don't be scared</i>

01:28:08.325 --> 01:28:09.994
<i>You got the mood prepared</i>

01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:12.037
<i>- Go on and kiss the girl
- Kiss the girl</i>

01:28:12.037 --> 01:28:14.373
<i>- Wow, wow
- Sha la la la la la</i>

01:28:14.540 --> 01:28:15.541
<i>Don't stop now</i>

01:28:15.708 --> 01:28:18.335
<i>Don't try to hide it
How you wanna</i>

01:28:18.335 --> 01:28:19.628
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

01:28:20.254 --> 01:28:21.672
<i>Sha la la la la la</i>

01:28:21.839 --> 01:28:22.923
<i>Float along</i>

01:28:23.090 --> 01:28:24.591
<i>And listen to the song</i>

01:28:24.591 --> 01:28:25.676
<i>The song say</i>

01:28:25.676 --> 01:28:27.594
<i>"Kiss the girl"</i>

01:28:27.761 --> 01:28:28.804
<i>Sha la la la la la</i>

01:28:28.971 --> 01:28:30.222
<i>The music play</i>

01:28:30.389 --> 01:28:31.849
<i>Do what the music say</i>

01:28:31.849 --> 01:28:32.975
- Oh!
<i>- You gotta</i>

01:28:32.975 --> 01:28:35.561
<i>- Kiss the girl</i>

01:28:35.561 --> 01:28:36.645
<i>You gotta</i>

01:28:36.645 --> 01:28:39.148
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

01:28:39.314 --> 01:28:40.315
<i>Why don't you</i>

01:28:40.315 --> 01:28:42.067
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

01:28:43.068 --> 01:28:45.904
<i>- Come on and
- Kiss the girl</i>

01:28:46.071 --> 01:28:47.489
<i>Go on and</i>

01:28:47.656 --> 01:28:49.658
<i>Kiss the girl</i>

01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:56.999
What...
What was that?

01:29:06.050 --> 01:29:07.801
That was close.

01:29:07.968 --> 01:29:09.219
Too close.

01:29:10.971 --> 01:29:12.431
I don't get it.

01:29:12.598 --> 01:29:14.975
I didn't think that little
barracuda stood a chance

01:29:14.975 --> 01:29:17.936
luring him in
without her voice.

01:29:18.103 --> 01:29:20.314
How's that even possible?

01:29:20.481 --> 01:29:22.733
Well, we're not gonna
let that happen again.

01:29:23.776 --> 01:29:27.404
It's time Ursula took matters
into her own tentacles.

01:29:27.571 --> 01:29:29.114
Where is it?

01:29:29.281 --> 01:29:32.201
Come on, come on.
It's gotta be here somewhere.

01:29:32.618 --> 01:29:35.412
No! No!

01:29:36.246 --> 01:29:38.415
Nobody ever puts
my things back!

01:29:40.876 --> 01:29:42.753
No! Where is it?

01:29:50.552 --> 01:29:53.889
No, no, no!

01:29:54.056 --> 01:29:57.434
No!

01:29:57.601 --> 01:29:59.019
Oh, there it is.

01:29:59.186 --> 01:30:01.230
I got it.

01:30:01.230 --> 01:30:04.525
That Prince won't know
what hit him.

01:30:05.234 --> 01:30:08.278
Only one more sunset

01:30:08.445 --> 01:30:10.614
and then I'll make
Triton writhe.

01:30:12.616 --> 01:30:16.537
I'll see him wriggle
like a worm on a hook.

01:30:25.671 --> 01:30:26.672
So where is she?

01:30:26.672 --> 01:30:28.465
We don't know, Father.
She's gone.

01:30:28.632 --> 01:30:29.883
What do you mean,
she's gone?

01:30:30.050 --> 01:30:31.301
We've been looking
and looking.

01:30:31.468 --> 01:30:32.636
There's no sign
of her anywhere.

01:30:32.636 --> 01:30:34.847
- She's not in these waters.
- Then look again.

01:30:34.847 --> 01:30:37.057
Search all of the Seven Seas
if you have to.

01:30:39.059 --> 01:30:40.227
Ariel wouldn't dare
go above again.

01:30:40.227 --> 01:30:41.436
Don't even think
such a thing.

01:30:42.563 --> 01:30:44.690
Doesn't make sense.
Why would she leave?

01:30:44.690 --> 01:30:46.358
I... I have no idea.

01:30:46.525 --> 01:30:48.610
Never mind that.
Just find her.

01:31:12.551 --> 01:31:14.261
What have I done?

01:31:27.149 --> 01:31:28.650
Everyone's asleep.

01:31:28.650 --> 01:31:30.736
- We should probably be quiet.
In his room,

01:31:30.736 --> 01:31:31.945
- all day?
Wait.

01:31:31.945 --> 01:31:33.030
- Go. Oh, no.
I haven't seen him once.

01:31:33.030 --> 01:31:34.531
Go, go. Go in there.
Go. Careful.

01:31:34.531 --> 01:31:35.908
I imagine he's just resting.

01:31:36.074 --> 01:31:37.242
Has he been avoiding me?

01:31:37.409 --> 01:31:38.452
No, Your Majesty.

01:31:38.452 --> 01:31:40.996
- No?
- No.

01:31:40.996 --> 01:31:42.623
You seem
awfully certain.

01:31:42.623 --> 01:31:43.707
Avoiding you?

01:31:43.707 --> 01:31:44.958
Doesn't seem like Eric,
does it?

01:31:44.958 --> 01:31:46.043
Then where is he?

01:31:46.418 --> 01:31:49.213
Oh, he's not searching
for that fantasy girl, I hope.

01:31:50.839 --> 01:31:51.882
No, Your Majesty.

01:31:52.049 --> 01:31:53.717
That I can say with certainty.

01:31:53.884 --> 01:31:55.761
Thank heavens
for small blessings.

01:31:55.761 --> 01:31:57.095
Oh!

01:31:57.095 --> 01:31:58.513
- It's wet.

01:31:59.473 --> 01:32:00.474
I will look into it.

01:32:00.474 --> 01:32:02.851
You really must get
some rest yourself.

01:32:03.018 --> 01:32:04.561
Yes,
I suppose I should.

01:32:04.728 --> 01:32:06.480
Thank you, Grimsby.
Good night.

01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:07.689
Ma'am.

01:32:07.856 --> 01:32:09.524
Sorry about that.

01:32:09.691 --> 01:32:12.402
I wasn't supposed
to leave the castle today.

01:32:12.569 --> 01:32:13.820
But I'm glad I did.

01:32:16.156 --> 01:32:17.407
All these rules...

01:32:19.076 --> 01:32:22.079
The truth is,
I wasn't born to all this,

01:32:22.246 --> 01:32:23.622
and it all makes me feel
a little uneasy...

01:32:23.622 --> 01:32:25.874
- Welcome back, sire.
- Oh, Grimsby.

01:32:25.874 --> 01:32:27.167
Uh...

01:32:27.167 --> 01:32:28.460
Uh...

01:32:28.460 --> 01:32:31.171
I trust you two had
a pleasant outing.

01:32:31.171 --> 01:32:32.631
Uh, yes, we did. Didn't we?

01:32:32.798 --> 01:32:34.466
Yes. Very nice.

01:32:34.633 --> 01:32:36.009
You've had a long day, Miss.

01:32:36.176 --> 01:32:38.553
I imagine we should
let you get some sleep.

01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:40.931
And perhaps dried off as well.

01:32:40.931 --> 01:32:42.182
Oh, uh... Yes.

01:32:42.182 --> 01:32:44.309
We... We took a rowboat out
onto the lagoon,

01:32:44.476 --> 01:32:46.144
and I'm afraid
we ended up in it.

01:32:47.229 --> 01:32:49.231
Anyway, good night.

01:32:52.234 --> 01:32:53.235
Oh.

01:32:58.782 --> 01:32:59.783
Good night...

01:33:00.951 --> 01:33:02.202
Ariel.

01:33:09.126 --> 01:33:11.086
About the carriages, sire,

01:33:11.712 --> 01:33:13.046
I'm afraid they, uh,

01:33:14.131 --> 01:33:16.049
didn't find the mystery girl.

01:33:17.092 --> 01:33:18.093
They didn't?

01:33:20.512 --> 01:33:21.763
Oh.

01:33:22.764 --> 01:33:24.516
May I then ask,

01:33:24.683 --> 01:33:26.727
should we continue the search?

01:33:29.271 --> 01:33:30.480
Grimsby, um...

01:33:31.523 --> 01:33:32.733
I just...

01:33:33.734 --> 01:33:35.319
I feel a little...

01:33:36.862 --> 01:33:40.157
Well, if you want the advice
of an old man, sire,

01:33:41.408 --> 01:33:44.119
don't be held back
by what you think should be.

01:33:44.953 --> 01:33:46.747
Think only of what is.

01:33:48.206 --> 01:33:49.207
Good night, sire.

01:36:18.398 --> 01:36:20.358
Hey! Wake up!
Wake up! Wake up!

01:36:20.525 --> 01:36:21.693
What?

01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:23.278
<i>Hey, have you
Not heard the scuttlebutt?</i>

01:36:23.278 --> 01:36:24.362
Your butt?

01:36:24.362 --> 01:36:25.822
<i>No, the gossip, the buzz</i>

01:36:25.822 --> 01:36:27.324
<i>The who-said-what-
who-does-that</i>

01:36:27.324 --> 01:36:28.617
<i>Yeah, the scuttlebutt</i>

01:36:28.783 --> 01:36:30.619
<i>Well, I was flying
Over land and sea</i>

01:36:30.619 --> 01:36:31.745
<i>An ear to the ground</i>

01:36:31.745 --> 01:36:33.997
<i>Then I came flying here
For you to see</i>

01:36:33.997 --> 01:36:35.123
<i>And hear what I found</i>

01:36:35.123 --> 01:36:36.374
<i>Remember the swamp?</i>

01:36:36.374 --> 01:36:38.210
<i>Remember my song in the swamp
When I was like</i>

01:36:38.210 --> 01:36:40.378
<i>"Womp chicka womp womp
Chicka womp womp"</i>

01:36:40.378 --> 01:36:41.463
I remember.

01:36:41.463 --> 01:36:42.547
<i>Well, ever since</i>

01:36:42.547 --> 01:36:43.632
<i>The what's his name?</i>

01:36:43.632 --> 01:36:45.175
<i>The guy with the hair
And the shirt</i>

01:36:45.175 --> 01:36:46.510
- The Prince.
<i>- Yeah, the Prince</i>

01:36:46.676 --> 01:36:48.678
<i>Has been dropping hints
He wants to</i>

01:36:48.678 --> 01:36:49.804
<i>You know when humans</i>

01:36:49.804 --> 01:36:51.473
<i>Dress all nice
Like they're penguins?</i>

01:36:51.473 --> 01:36:52.766
<i>Throw rice for the pigeons?</i>

01:36:52.766 --> 01:36:54.267
<i>They're trying to blow up
The pigeons</i>

01:36:54.267 --> 01:36:55.852
<i>But those are
Just urban legends</i>

01:36:55.852 --> 01:36:57.979
<i>I know a lot
Of really fat pigeons</i>

01:36:57.979 --> 01:36:59.064
Scuttle...

01:36:59.064 --> 01:37:00.732
<i>Will you Just listen,
Sebastian?</i>

01:37:00.732 --> 01:37:02.817
<i>- I got the scuttlebutt</i>
- Hurry up.

01:37:02.817 --> 01:37:05.487
<i>You'll be like, "What?"
When I drop that scuttlebutt</i>

01:37:05.487 --> 01:37:07.489
<i>Okay, now
Huddle up, buttercup</i>

01:37:07.656 --> 01:37:09.074
<i>From the women
Who wash all the clothes</i>

01:37:09.241 --> 01:37:10.659
<i>To the hunter
Who arrows the bows</i>

01:37:10.825 --> 01:37:11.910
<i>The chatter
All over the palace</i>

01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:12.994
<i>Is that your Prince Eric</i>

01:37:12.994 --> 01:37:14.162
<i>- Is gonna propose</i>
What?

01:37:14.162 --> 01:37:15.497
<i>To somebody</i> n<i>obody knows</i>

01:37:15.497 --> 01:37:16.831
<i>They're saying
He suddenly chose</i>

01:37:16.831 --> 01:37:17.916
- Who?
<i>- Who?</i>

01:37:17.916 --> 01:37:19.543
<i>You sound like an owl
I'll bet it's the kid</i>

01:37:19.543 --> 01:37:20.961
<i>- With the new set of toes
-</i> No!

01:37:20.961 --> 01:37:23.338
<i>Oh, yes, anything goes
Who'd ever guess</i>

01:37:23.338 --> 01:37:24.881
<i>Our little Ariel's
Marriage material?</i>

01:37:24.881 --> 01:37:26.007
<i>Time for the rice
And the dress</i>

01:37:26.007 --> 01:37:27.092
<i>And the what do you call it?</i>

01:37:27.092 --> 01:37:29.219
<i>The thing with the lips
When they press</i>

01:37:29.386 --> 01:37:30.971
<i>I don't have lips
I have a beak</i>

01:37:31.137 --> 01:37:32.597
<i>So I guess I could give you
A peck on the cheek</i>

01:37:32.597 --> 01:37:33.890
I don't believe it.

01:37:34.057 --> 01:37:35.892
Say, you're awfully quiet.

01:37:37.018 --> 01:37:38.728
Oh, yeah. So, uh, what now?

01:37:38.728 --> 01:37:40.021
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

01:37:40.188 --> 01:37:42.065
<i>Can you believe
The scuttlebutt?</i>

01:37:42.232 --> 01:37:43.650
Get dressed, child.

01:37:43.817 --> 01:37:45.235
<i>You're welcome
For the scuttlebutt</i>

01:37:45.235 --> 01:37:47.654
We got a lot
of work to do before sundown.

01:37:47.654 --> 01:37:49.239
<i>The s-s-s-s-scuttlebutt
Scuttlebutt, hey!</i>

01:37:49.239 --> 01:37:51.408
Oh, please
let this be the day.

01:37:51.408 --> 01:37:53.201
<i>- Let's go, let's go, let's go
- Let's go</i>

01:37:53.201 --> 01:37:55.495
<i>We got it, the gossip
The buzz</i>

01:37:55.662 --> 01:37:56.830
<i>The who-said-what-
who-does-that</i>

01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:58.832
<i>Yeah, I told you so
Let's go, let's go, let's go</i>

01:37:58.832 --> 01:38:00.125
<i>We gotta go
Before the sun goes down</i>

01:38:00.125 --> 01:38:01.209
<i>What? Got to get her ready</i>

01:38:01.209 --> 01:38:02.294
<i>- For the big showdown
- Right</i>

01:38:02.294 --> 01:38:03.378
<i>Go ahead and get her
Out of bed</i>

01:38:03.378 --> 01:38:04.462
<i>And get her ready
For the wedding</i>

01:38:04.462 --> 01:38:05.547
<i>Sun is setting
So we can't slow down</i>

01:38:05.547 --> 01:38:07.549
<i>The scuttlebutt</i>

01:38:12.804 --> 01:38:14.055
Scuttle,
you're too close.

01:38:23.898 --> 01:38:24.983
Oh!

01:38:26.276 --> 01:38:28.695
My goodness,
it is wonderful news.

01:38:28.695 --> 01:38:30.697
- Isn't it, Grimsby?
Oh, yes.

01:38:30.864 --> 01:38:33.783
I must admit,
I was mistaken.

01:38:34.492 --> 01:38:35.869
It seems you really
have found

01:38:35.869 --> 01:38:38.079
the girl of your dreams
after all.

01:38:38.246 --> 01:38:40.999
Yes. Quite the surprise, Eric.

01:38:42.125 --> 01:38:43.126
What?

01:38:43.126 --> 01:38:45.128
Oh. Uh, I know.

01:38:45.128 --> 01:38:46.755
I know it must seem fast,

01:38:46.755 --> 01:38:49.549
but... but I do owe her
my life.

01:38:49.549 --> 01:38:50.675
We will celebrate.

01:38:50.675 --> 01:38:52.010
This evening.

01:38:52.177 --> 01:38:54.763
You shall introduce
your intended to the court.

01:38:55.347 --> 01:38:57.140
We can make that happen,
can't we, Grimsby?

01:38:57.140 --> 01:38:58.266
Yes.

01:38:58.266 --> 01:39:00.518
If it's really
what you want, Eric.

01:39:01.811 --> 01:39:03.688
What I... want?

01:39:03.688 --> 01:39:06.107
It's...

01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:08.526
It's what we both want.

01:39:09.444 --> 01:39:10.904
Lovely.

01:39:11.071 --> 01:39:12.697
Well, we've got our work
cut out for us.

01:39:12.697 --> 01:39:14.157
Mm-hmm. Indeed.

01:39:14.324 --> 01:39:16.701
Then let's
begin preparations. Grimsby...

01:39:20.622 --> 01:39:22.248
Oh, Ariel, girl.

01:39:22.415 --> 01:39:23.667
Where have you gone?

01:39:24.959 --> 01:39:26.795
- Yeah. Any sign of her?
- No luck.

01:39:26.961 --> 01:39:28.713
I flew over the village
three times.

01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:30.298
Well, check the castle again!

01:39:30.465 --> 01:39:32.634
It's almost sunset.
We got to find her.

01:39:32.634 --> 01:39:33.718
Copy that.

01:39:33.718 --> 01:39:35.428
What's wrong
with that fool Prince?

01:39:35.428 --> 01:39:37.263
Something fishy going on here.
I don't like

01:39:37.263 --> 01:39:38.348
- the smell of it... Hey.
Sebastian!

01:39:38.348 --> 01:39:39.432
- Over here.
- Yeah, what?

01:39:39.432 --> 01:39:40.558
I coming, I coming. Hold on.

01:39:41.142 --> 01:39:42.143
Yes, what?

01:39:42.143 --> 01:39:43.812
I think I know where Ariel is.

01:39:43.978 --> 01:39:45.146
Well, what are we waiting for?

01:39:45.146 --> 01:39:46.648
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

01:39:55.407 --> 01:39:57.283
Ariel?

01:40:30.066 --> 01:40:31.901
So long, Red.

01:40:39.534 --> 01:40:41.286
Oh, no!

01:41:08.271 --> 01:41:10.690
<i>Risking it all</i>

01:41:10.857 --> 01:41:13.193
<i>Only to fall</i>

01:41:13.359 --> 01:41:17.071
<i>Back where I started</i>

01:41:17.071 --> 01:41:19.282
<i>Back near the shore</i>

01:41:19.449 --> 01:41:21.618
<i>Back to before</i>

01:41:21.785 --> 01:41:25.330
<i>You took my hand</i>

01:41:26.456 --> 01:41:28.500
<i>Bet ya on land</i>

01:41:28.666 --> 01:41:30.668
<i>They understand</i>

01:41:30.835 --> 01:41:36.758
<i>And they don't
Strand you brokenhearted</i>

01:41:39.177 --> 01:41:43.306
<i>What did I give to live
Where you are?</i>

01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:50.897
<i>Where do I go
With nowhere to turn to?</i>

01:41:57.028 --> 01:41:59.030
Hey,
what are you doin', child?

01:41:59.197 --> 01:42:01.241
You can't give up so easily.

01:42:01.407 --> 01:42:04.077
This all has to be
some sort of misunderstanding.

01:42:04.619 --> 01:42:05.870
I watched both of you.

01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:07.580
You're meant to be together.

01:42:07.580 --> 01:42:09.707
There you are.
I've been lookin'.

01:42:09.707 --> 01:42:12.001
And I... And I thought
I found you, 'cause I heard.

01:42:12.168 --> 01:42:14.587
But... But then
I saw it wasn't you.

01:42:14.587 --> 01:42:15.672
It... It was her!

01:42:15.672 --> 01:42:16.756
But... But it wasn't...

01:42:16.756 --> 01:42:18.466
In the mirror,
except she had...

01:42:18.466 --> 01:42:19.551
She had your voice!

01:42:19.551 --> 01:42:20.885
What are you talkin' about?

01:42:21.386 --> 01:42:22.846
Don't you get
what I'm tellin' you?

01:42:22.846 --> 01:42:25.598
- No!
- The Prince has been tricked.

01:42:25.598 --> 01:42:27.267
That lady who showed up

01:42:27.267 --> 01:42:29.269
is actually
the Sea Witch in disguise.

01:42:29.769 --> 01:42:30.979
Are you sure about this?

01:42:30.979 --> 01:42:32.397
Of course I'm sure!

01:42:32.564 --> 01:42:33.690
Have I ever been wrong?

01:42:33.690 --> 01:42:35.608
I mean, like, you know,
when it counts?

01:42:35.775 --> 01:42:37.277
Well, what are we gonna do?

01:42:37.443 --> 01:42:38.611
Well, we have to do something

01:42:38.611 --> 01:42:41.990
before Prince Eric ends up
with that slimy squid.

01:42:42.156 --> 01:42:43.741
Yes, girl, go!

01:42:43.908 --> 01:42:45.994
Flounder, go tell the Sea King
what's happened.

01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:47.412
He has to know everything.

01:42:47.412 --> 01:42:48.538
- Okay.
Oh...

01:42:48.705 --> 01:42:49.998
What do I... What...
What do I do?

01:42:49.998 --> 01:42:51.583
You give me a lift
to the castle.

01:42:52.166 --> 01:42:55.378
We got to find a way
to stall that engagement.

01:43:02.135 --> 01:43:04.178
Really is very special.

01:43:04.178 --> 01:43:06.472
Heroism's too strong
a word for it,

01:43:08.016 --> 01:43:09.851
but I suppose I did save Eric.

01:43:10.977 --> 01:43:12.687
- That's what anyone would do.
Of course.

01:43:12.687 --> 01:43:14.147
- Grimsby.
Sire.

01:43:14.939 --> 01:43:16.190
Have you seen Ariel?

01:43:16.357 --> 01:43:17.400
According to the servants,

01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:18.943
she left the castle
early this morning.

01:43:19.110 --> 01:43:20.153
Left?

01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:21.946
Can you blame her, Eric?

01:43:21.946 --> 01:43:24.532
I don't understand.
This is not like you.

01:43:25.575 --> 01:43:27.118
I'm not sure
I understand it myself.

01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:30.204
I just wanted to...

01:43:30.371 --> 01:43:31.664
- I thought if...
Eric.

01:43:32.582 --> 01:43:33.583
Thank you.

01:43:36.169 --> 01:43:38.087
I don't really know
what I wanted.

01:43:47.347 --> 01:43:48.932
Almost there!

01:43:49.098 --> 01:43:52.936
Now, when I give the signal,
you drop me!

01:43:53.102 --> 01:43:54.312
- Got it?
- Got it.

01:43:54.479 --> 01:43:56.189
No, you idiot...

01:43:57.565 --> 01:43:58.983
Guess I'm on my own.

01:44:02.362 --> 01:44:04.072
My darling,

01:44:04.072 --> 01:44:07.408
this belonged to my mother.

01:44:07.575 --> 01:44:09.327
And I'd like you to have it.

01:44:10.328 --> 01:44:13.206
Your happiness means
everything to me.

01:44:13.206 --> 01:44:14.415
You're very sweet, um...

01:44:15.792 --> 01:44:17.126
Uh, would you excuse me?

01:44:23.383 --> 01:44:24.467
Enjoy yourself.

01:44:27.762 --> 01:44:29.138
Oh, Eric.

01:44:29.138 --> 01:44:31.349
- It's beautiful.

01:44:33.309 --> 01:44:35.311
- What in the...
- The ring.

01:44:35.478 --> 01:44:36.938
The ring. I lost...

01:44:37.105 --> 01:44:38.773
Has anybody seen the ring?

01:44:38.773 --> 01:44:39.857
Have you seen the ring?

01:44:40.817 --> 01:44:41.818
Have you seen it?

01:44:43.528 --> 01:44:45.405
Get off me, you filthy bird!

01:44:51.035 --> 01:44:53.871
Help me! I'm being attacked!

01:44:56.082 --> 01:44:58.668
Ariel! Ariel,
I've been looking for you.

01:44:58.835 --> 01:45:00.670
Who is that?

01:45:01.212 --> 01:45:02.338
What are you doing?

01:45:03.589 --> 01:45:04.924
- Grimsby, let me go!
- Sire!

01:45:04.924 --> 01:45:06.300
Get her away from me!

01:45:06.467 --> 01:45:07.468
She's insane!

01:45:07.969 --> 01:45:08.970
What's going on?

01:45:09.345 --> 01:45:10.847
Ariel, stop!

01:45:13.307 --> 01:45:14.308
- Get off!

01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:47.717
Ariel.

01:45:48.676 --> 01:45:49.844
Yes.

01:45:51.179 --> 01:45:52.388
It was you all along.

01:45:53.931 --> 01:45:54.932
I should've known.

01:45:57.101 --> 01:45:58.936
I don't know
what came over me.

01:45:58.936 --> 01:46:00.188
She bewitched you.

01:46:00.188 --> 01:46:01.647
Get away from her!

01:46:01.647 --> 01:46:02.982
Eric, I want you to know I...

01:46:02.982 --> 01:46:04.233
Oh, just kiss!

01:46:04.233 --> 01:46:05.318
I want you to know everything.

01:46:05.318 --> 01:46:06.486
Nothing matters now.

01:46:08.738 --> 01:46:10.031
No!

01:46:23.836 --> 01:46:26.547
Oh, good Lord.
She's a sea creature.

01:46:27.256 --> 01:46:29.509
You're too late!

01:46:30.885 --> 01:46:34.430
You're too late!

01:46:43.314 --> 01:46:44.315
Stay back!

01:46:44.482 --> 01:46:45.650
Shut up!

01:46:48.027 --> 01:46:49.278
Eric!

01:46:55.660 --> 01:46:57.912
- Eric, no.

01:46:57.912 --> 01:46:59.205
This is the work
of the sea gods.

01:46:59.205 --> 01:47:00.289
I warned you.

01:47:00.289 --> 01:47:01.833
Their whole world is evil.

01:47:01.999 --> 01:47:04.210
Eric, wait! Eric!

01:47:08.089 --> 01:47:09.882
What are you doing?
Let go of me!

01:47:10.049 --> 01:47:12.510
Not a chance. You made
a deal, remember?

01:47:12.677 --> 01:47:14.178
Three days, no kiss.

01:47:15.346 --> 01:47:17.598
Yeah, is it all comin'
back to ya?

01:47:18.391 --> 01:47:20.101
I thought so.

01:47:20.268 --> 01:47:22.478
Well, now you gotta live
with it, toots.

01:47:34.866 --> 01:47:36.659
Ursula!

01:47:38.077 --> 01:47:40.413
Let her go.

01:47:40.580 --> 01:47:42.248
Forget it,
Big Brother.

01:47:42.415 --> 01:47:44.917
She belongs to me now.

01:47:49.422 --> 01:47:51.048
Oh, you see?

01:47:51.465 --> 01:47:53.134
We made a deal.

01:47:53.301 --> 01:47:54.552
In blood.

01:47:54.719 --> 01:47:57.430
It's unbreakable,
even for you.

01:47:57.930 --> 01:48:00.266
I'm sorry, Father.
This is all my fault.

01:48:00.433 --> 01:48:02.101
What do you want
with my daughter?

01:48:02.101 --> 01:48:03.186
Oh.

01:48:03.644 --> 01:48:05.229
Nothing.

01:48:05.396 --> 01:48:07.190
It's you I want.

01:48:07.356 --> 01:48:09.108
I want to see you suffer,

01:48:09.108 --> 01:48:11.319
like I've suffered
all these years.

01:48:12.278 --> 01:48:15.656
And the daughter
of the great Sea King

01:48:15.823 --> 01:48:18.242
is a very precious commodity.

01:48:18.784 --> 01:48:21.204
Oh, poor, unfortunate soul.

01:48:21.871 --> 01:48:23.456
Hey! Get her, boys!

01:48:27.585 --> 01:48:29.712
Uh-uh. I wouldn't.

01:48:31.839 --> 01:48:33.132
Shocking, isn't it?

01:48:34.717 --> 01:48:36.302
Of course, I always was a gal

01:48:36.302 --> 01:48:38.471
with an eye for a bargain.

01:48:38.888 --> 01:48:42.016
What do you say
to a trade, hmm?

01:48:42.183 --> 01:48:44.560
What's your precious
little Ariel worth to ya?

01:48:58.783 --> 01:49:00.826
It's mine now.

01:49:07.208 --> 01:49:08.459
No!

01:49:10.670 --> 01:49:12.129
Father!

01:49:28.604 --> 01:49:29.730
You...

01:49:30.106 --> 01:49:31.357
You monster!

01:49:33.484 --> 01:49:35.486
Don't be a fool,
you little brat!

01:49:36.404 --> 01:49:37.822
You are powerless against...

01:49:39.699 --> 01:49:41.409
You're gonna pay for that.

01:49:42.618 --> 01:49:43.619
Get him!

01:49:52.628 --> 01:49:55.756
Say goodbye
to your human heartthrob.

01:49:55.923 --> 01:49:57.550
- Don't!

01:49:58.926 --> 01:49:59.927
Ahh!

01:50:00.428 --> 01:50:01.470
My babies!

01:50:29.623 --> 01:50:30.750
Eric!

01:50:37.256 --> 01:50:38.841
Get to shore. She'll kill you!

01:50:39.383 --> 01:50:41.677
- I'm not leaving you!

01:50:53.397 --> 01:50:56.067
Yes!

01:50:56.609 --> 01:50:57.985
Give me your hand!

01:51:01.572 --> 01:51:02.656
Now!

01:51:13.334 --> 01:51:14.335
Look out!

01:51:18.339 --> 01:51:21.092
Now I rule the seas

01:51:21.258 --> 01:51:25.471
and all will be helpless
under my power!

01:51:29.892 --> 01:51:31.143
No!

01:51:31.977 --> 01:51:35.064
So much for true love.

01:52:39.128 --> 01:52:41.672
So long, lover boy.

01:55:24.084 --> 01:55:26.378
You gave your life for me.

01:55:29.506 --> 01:55:32.384
And you fought
to get my life back.

01:55:35.679 --> 01:55:37.556
I didn't fight alone, Father.

01:55:39.099 --> 01:55:41.560
Eric was with me.

01:55:44.730 --> 01:55:48.776
All that matters now is
that you're safe and home.

01:55:50.486 --> 01:55:51.862
Where you belong.

01:56:25.813 --> 01:56:27.856
Sire, please!
- We need a boat.

01:56:27.856 --> 01:56:30.109
Grimsby, we have to find her!

01:56:30.109 --> 01:56:31.402
And then what?

01:56:36.448 --> 01:56:39.660
And then what, Eric?

01:56:42.204 --> 01:56:43.330
Darling.

01:56:45.082 --> 01:56:46.291
You were right.

01:56:48.001 --> 01:56:49.712
I was chasing
after a fantasy girl.

01:56:49.712 --> 01:56:53.173
No. No, I was wrong.

01:56:53.340 --> 01:56:54.717
She was very real.

01:56:55.551 --> 01:56:57.928
And so were your feelings
for her, I see that now.

01:56:59.346 --> 01:57:00.514
It's just that...

01:57:03.058 --> 01:57:05.519
our worlds were never meant
to be together.

01:57:52.191 --> 01:57:53.650
Sebastian!

01:57:58.363 --> 01:58:00.240
You gotta be kidding me.

01:58:13.629 --> 01:58:15.255
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:58:17.132 --> 01:58:20.719
I have always tried to do
what's best for our people.

01:58:20.886 --> 01:58:22.596
Yes, Your Majesty.

01:58:23.514 --> 01:58:25.641
And what's best
for my daughters.

01:58:25.766 --> 01:58:27.476
Indeed, Your Majesty.

01:58:28.727 --> 01:58:30.854
And I've done everything
in my power

01:58:30.854 --> 01:58:32.981
to make her happy.

01:58:35.609 --> 01:58:38.487
Well, not quite.

01:58:47.037 --> 01:58:48.539
She wants
a different life

01:58:48.539 --> 01:58:50.082
than I had planned for her.

01:58:50.082 --> 01:58:52.835
She did try
to tell you, Your Majesty.

01:58:54.795 --> 01:58:57.422
But I won't be able
to protect her anymore.

01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:59.633
Well, it's like I always say,

01:58:59.800 --> 01:59:02.886
children got to be free
to lead their own lives.

01:59:03.053 --> 01:59:04.596
Oh, is that what
you always say?

01:59:04.763 --> 01:59:05.931
Somethin' like that. Yeah.

01:59:09.852 --> 01:59:12.354
Then there's just
one problem left.

01:59:12.521 --> 01:59:14.439
And what's that,
Your Majesty?

01:59:16.066 --> 01:59:18.360
How much I'm going
to miss my little one.

01:59:50.934 --> 01:59:52.561
Good boy. Go on.

02:00:03.780 --> 02:00:04.865
Again?

02:00:18.921 --> 02:00:19.922
Max?

02:01:17.813 --> 02:01:19.815
Blessings to you both.

02:01:20.816 --> 02:01:22.234
Magical news, yeah.

02:01:22.401 --> 02:01:23.777
Oh, what's all this, Grims?

02:01:23.944 --> 02:01:25.654
Oh, the Queen wanted
the two of you

02:01:25.654 --> 02:01:27.781
to have
a proper send-off, sire.

02:01:27.948 --> 02:01:29.324
Thank you, Your Majesty.

02:01:29.491 --> 02:01:31.910
No. Thank you.

02:01:32.077 --> 02:01:33.620
Much as I hate farewells,

02:01:33.620 --> 02:01:36.456
we still have cause
to celebrate.

02:01:36.623 --> 02:01:40.794
Our worlds have misunderstood
one another for far too long.

02:01:40.961 --> 02:01:43.880
Your marriage marks
a new beginning for us.

02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:46.258
Yes. A beginning.

02:01:47.009 --> 02:01:48.010
Now,

02:01:48.593 --> 02:01:50.053
get out there

02:01:50.220 --> 02:01:51.722
and change the world,

02:01:51.888 --> 02:01:52.973
or whatever it is
you have to do,

02:01:52.973 --> 02:01:54.057
so we don't get left behind.

02:01:54.975 --> 02:01:56.435
That doesn't sound
like my mother.

02:01:56.435 --> 02:01:57.978
- What have you done with her?
- Oh!

02:01:57.978 --> 02:02:00.230
- Off you go.

02:02:01.440 --> 02:02:03.734
Have you decided
where you're headed first?

02:02:05.360 --> 02:02:06.778
- Uncharted waters.

02:02:06.778 --> 02:02:07.904
Okay!

02:02:07.904 --> 02:02:09.281
A mermaid and a man.

02:02:10.323 --> 02:02:11.908
Whoever would have imagined?

02:02:16.079 --> 02:02:17.748
Well, look who's here.

02:02:18.331 --> 02:02:20.292
- We got you something, Ariel.
- Sure did.

02:02:20.292 --> 02:02:22.169
Something you almost lost.

02:02:22.169 --> 02:02:23.336
Where... Where is it?

02:02:23.336 --> 02:02:25.088
You're sittin' on it, bird.

02:02:25.088 --> 02:02:26.381
Ow!

02:02:27.966 --> 02:02:29.551
My little mermaid.

02:02:32.387 --> 02:02:33.972
Keep her for me.

02:02:34.139 --> 02:02:36.641
I hope she causes you
less trouble than I did.

02:02:36.808 --> 02:02:39.061
I was right about
the dinglehopper, wasn't I?

02:02:39.436 --> 02:02:41.688
Yes, you were, Scuttle.
You were.

02:02:41.855 --> 02:02:43.273
You won't
be gone too long,

02:02:43.732 --> 02:02:45.609
- will you, Ariel?
Of course not.

02:02:45.984 --> 02:02:47.652
I'll be back
by the next Coral Moon.

02:02:48.779 --> 02:02:50.447
Yeah, don't be late this time.

02:03:11.259 --> 02:03:12.260
You ready?

02:03:15.555 --> 02:03:16.556
Yes.

02:03:17.516 --> 02:03:19.059
Yes, I'm ready.

02:03:59.057 --> 02:04:00.267
My child.

02:04:05.438 --> 02:04:06.439
Eric.

02:04:11.153 --> 02:04:13.113
Thank you for hearing me.

02:04:14.823 --> 02:04:16.449
You shouldn't have had
to give up your voice

02:04:16.449 --> 02:04:17.701
to be heard.

02:04:18.493 --> 02:04:20.120
But now I am listening.

02:04:22.455 --> 02:04:24.332
And I will always
be here for you.

02:04:26.209 --> 02:04:27.335
We all will.

02:05:12.005 --> 02:05:13.757
I love you, Father.

02:06:01.304 --> 02:06:06.101
<i>The seaweed is always greener
In somebody else's lake</i>

02:06:06.268 --> 02:06:11.106
<i>You dream about going up there
But that is a big mistake</i>

02:06:11.273 --> 02:06:13.775
<i>Just look at the world
Around you</i>

02:06:13.775 --> 02:06:16.111
<i>Right here on the ocean floor</i>

02:06:16.278 --> 02:06:18.738
<i>Such wonderful things
Surround you</i>

02:06:18.738 --> 02:06:21.324
<i>What more is you lookin' for?</i>

02:06:21.491 --> 02:06:25.578
<i>Under the sea
Under the sea</i>

02:06:26.538 --> 02:06:28.957
<i>Darling, it's better
Down where it's wetter</i>

02:06:28.957 --> 02:06:30.625
<i>Take it from me</i>

02:06:31.543 --> 02:06:33.920
<i>Up on the shore
They work all day</i>

02:06:34.087 --> 02:06:36.381
<i>Out in the sun they slave away</i>

02:06:36.548 --> 02:06:39.050
<i>While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'</i>

02:06:39.217 --> 02:06:40.802
<i>Under the sea</i>

02:06:45.098 --> 02:06:47.559
<i>Down here
All the fish is happy</i>

02:06:47.559 --> 02:06:49.936
<i>As off through the waves
They roll</i>

02:06:50.103 --> 02:06:52.439
<i>The fish on the land
Ain't happy</i>

02:06:52.439 --> 02:06:54.941
<i>They sad 'cause
They in they bowl</i>

02:06:55.108 --> 02:06:59.904
<i>But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate</i>

02:07:00.071 --> 02:07:02.490
<i>One day when the boss
Get hungry</i>

02:07:02.490 --> 02:07:04.367
<i>Guess who gon' be
On the plate?</i>

02:07:04.534 --> 02:07:06.911
<i>Oh, no
Under the sea</i>

02:07:07.871 --> 02:07:10.081
<i>Under the sea</i>

02:07:10.248 --> 02:07:12.709
<i>Nobody beat us
Fry us and eat us</i>

02:07:12.876 --> 02:07:14.419
<i>In fricassee</i>

02:07:15.295 --> 02:07:17.672
<i>We what the land folks
Love to cook</i>

<i>Under the sea we off the hook</i>

02:07:26.556 --> 02:07:27.807
<i>- Under the sea
- Yes, child.</i>

02:07:27.974 --> 02:07:30.185
<i>Since life is sweet here
We got the beat here</i>

02:07:30.352 --> 02:07:32.520
-<i>Naturally

02:07:32.687 --> 02:07:35.065
<i>Even the sturgeon an' the ray</i>

02:07:35.065 --> 02:07:37.692
<i>They get the urge
'N' start to play</i>

02:07:37.859 --> 02:07:40.236
<i>We got the spirit
You got to hear it</i>

<i>Under the sea</i>

02:07:44.532 --> 02:07:45.658
<i>Watch this.</i>

02:07:45.825 --> 02:07:48.161
<i>The newt play the flute
The carp play the harp</i>
