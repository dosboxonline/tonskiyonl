your explanation
for this is?

08:20.709 --> 08:22.753
I have no explanation.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.630
Certainly no excuses.

08:24.713 --> 08:28.508
Except to once again
respectfully remind
the council

of the triangle.

38:30.350 --> 38:33.937
The triangle was forged
from metal found
in the crater of a meteor

at the exact moment

38:36.106 --> 38:39.317
of the previous alignment
of the nine planets.

38:39.401 --> 38:41.778
The people of the light
built a great city
in this crater

38:41.862 --> 38:46.241
where they worshipped
the triangle for its ability
to control time.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.534
It gave its possessor
a power

38:47.617 --> 38:50.704
that could be used
for good or great evil.

38:50.787 --> 38:53.957
The abuse of this power
led to the destruction
of the city.

38:56.835 --> 39:00.797
To be sure no man would
ever again wield this power,

39:00.881 --> 39:03.091
they split the triangle
into two pieces

39:03.175 --> 39:06.470
and hid them
at opposite ends
of the earth.

39:06.553 --> 39:09.848
Lara, do you remember
the jasmine that only grows

39:09.931 --> 39:13.560
in one temple along
the ancient Khmer trail
in Cambodia?

39:13.643 --> 39:17.898
Find that and you will
have found the entrance to
the tomb of the dancing light,

39:17.981 --> 39:21.193
where the first half
of the triangle is hidden.

39:21.276 --> 39:23.904

move into alignment,
