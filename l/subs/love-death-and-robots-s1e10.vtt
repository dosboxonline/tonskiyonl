00:48.755 --> 00:51.755
[man]<i> I had that dream about</i>
<i>your sister again last night.</i>

00:52.255 --> 00:56.963
<i>Oh, it was me and her in the scrub</i>
<i>behind the mess hall. </i>[grunts]

00:57.547 --> 00:59.213
<i>She's biting my neck. </i>[snicker]

00:59.297 --> 01:03.380
I swear to God, we are going at it
like fucking animals, bro.

01:03.797 --> 01:06.588
[grunts repeatedly]

01:07.172 --> 01:08.588
I don't even have a sister.

01:09.088 --> 01:11.797
Then why do you get so mad
when I dream about fucking her?

01:13.422 --> 01:14.463
<i>-Hold up a sec.</i>
-Hu-ah!

01:16.547 --> 01:17.838
[sniffs]

01:20.255 --> 01:22.463
[man via radio] <i>Decker? Talk to me, bro.</i>

01:22.672 --> 01:24.088
[gunshot]

01:24.797 --> 01:26.172
Contact!

01:26.547 --> 01:27.838
[growls]

01:28.005 --> 01:29.797
[man via radio] <i>Decker, </i>
<i>you got eyes on the fucker?</i>

01:29.880 --> 01:31.005
-[gunshot]
-Argh!

01:32.255 --> 01:33.672
[Decker panting]

01:38.255 --> 01:40.797
Three four five degrees,
one five zero yards,

01:40.880 --> 01:43.255
small structure, white side, level...

02:00.255 --> 02:02.088
<i>-</i>[man via radio] <i>You all right, Decker?</i>
-Yeah.

02:02.172 --> 02:04.255
Fucker almost shot my dick off.

02:04.838 --> 02:07.547
<i>[man] Hmm.</i>
<i>Well, if he could hit a target that tiny,</i>

02:07.880 --> 02:09.672
<i>we should sign him up on our side.</i>

02:13.880 --> 02:15.005
[laughter]

02:26.297 --> 02:27.672
You can't sit here.

02:27.755 --> 02:29.505
I don't see any reserved signs.

02:30.380 --> 02:34.130
I said, <i>you </i>can't sit here.

02:36.338 --> 02:40.172
The corps turned to shit when they started
lettin' you animals wear the uniform.

02:40.713 --> 02:44.963
Look, my buddy took a bullet
for you guys today so... back off.

02:45.047 --> 02:50.547
Yeah, see, and I don't trust anything
that bleeds that much and then walks away.

02:51.755 --> 02:54.380
-Unnatural is what you are.
-Unnatural?

02:55.005 --> 02:57.588
I can stalk my prey by scent alone.

02:58.338 --> 03:01.963
I can run for miles while you need
to ride in a stinking Humvee all day.

03:02.047 --> 03:04.797
I can see clearly on a moonless night,

03:04.880 --> 03:07.505
while you cling to your flashlight
as soon as the sun goes down.

03:07.588 --> 03:10.130
You ask me,
there's not much natural in that.

03:11.797 --> 03:13.672
You fuckin' dog soldiers.

03:14.338 --> 03:15.172
[clears throat]

03:15.713 --> 03:17.463
No disrespect, Sergeant...

03:18.713 --> 03:20.713
but if you call us dog soldiers again...

03:21.797 --> 03:24.172
I'll rip your arm off
and beat you to death with it.

03:27.547 --> 03:28.797
You wanna try it?

03:30.630 --> 03:33.588
[growls]

03:42.838 --> 03:43.713
Come on.

03:44.213 --> 03:46.088
Smells like dog shit in here.

03:50.588 --> 03:52.588
[rock music plays]

03:53.630 --> 03:55.172
You know what I think it is?

03:56.588 --> 03:57.672
Jealousy.

03:58.463 --> 03:59.672
Mm-hmm.  

04:00.047 --> 04:03.463
Those guys know that
if the brass cut us loose,

04:04.005 --> 04:06.338
we'd have this shit cleaned up
in three weeks.

04:06.422 --> 04:08.130
I think it's more complicated than that.

04:08.422 --> 04:11.005
No, you're right.
They're fuckin' terrified of us, too.

04:11.255 --> 04:12.255
[chuckles]

04:12.380 --> 04:13.505
Claws and blood, baby.

04:13.588 --> 04:16.130
They don't understand us
any more than they do this fucking war,

04:16.213 --> 04:18.088
which is why we don't belong here.

04:20.922 --> 04:25.880
Look, I don't like every asshole
that calls himself an American,

04:26.755 --> 04:28.797
but it's still my fuckin' country.

04:30.380 --> 04:31.672
You hear me, boy?

04:33.547 --> 04:35.547
[mimics drill sergeant]
Do you hear me, Cadet?

04:35.630 --> 04:36.963
Stand up straight!

04:37.047 --> 04:41.213
We are here for duty, honor and country,
Momma and apple pie.

04:41.297 --> 04:43.963
I'm just here to make sure
you don't get your dumb ass killed.

04:44.047 --> 04:44.880
Your dumb ass.

04:44.963 --> 04:48.588
I think you're both here
because dogs gotta hunt.

04:48.672 --> 04:50.463
-Sir!
-At ease.

04:50.713 --> 04:53.130
We're rotating squads at
the forward operating base.

04:53.630 --> 04:56.588
Sobieski, you're with the outgoing squad.

05:06.047 --> 05:08.713
Try not to piss off any of the regulars
while you're up there.

05:08.963 --> 05:12.130
[scoffs] If they're smart,
they'll be trying hard not to piss <i>me </i>off.

05:12.213 --> 05:13.963
-Is that right, tough guy?
-Uh-huh.

05:14.047 --> 05:15.505
Now, remember, honey,

05:15.838 --> 05:17.130
[tearfully] if you need anything,

05:17.255 --> 05:20.463
-I'll be right at the top of that hill.
-You're so full of shit.

05:20.547 --> 05:22.172
-And you're an idiot.
-[man] Let's go.

05:24.838 --> 05:26.505
[Sobieski shouts] Claws and blood, baby!

05:31.297 --> 05:33.297
[crickets chirping]

05:40.672 --> 05:42.672
[distant gunfire]

05:45.297 --> 05:46.922
[distant shouting]

05:50.338 --> 05:52.130
-I need head count from the rear.
-[man] Copy!

05:52.213 --> 05:53.922
Fire Team leader,
make sure your team is up.

05:54.005 --> 05:56.130
-[man] Yes, sir.
-[Decker] What's the situation?

05:56.213 --> 05:57.047
Fuck if I know.

05:57.130 --> 05:59.713
Call came in about intruders
inside the fire base perimeter,

06:00.005 --> 06:01.005
then comms went down.

06:01.505 --> 06:03.880
-So the Major's sending us in.
-I'm going up there.

06:03.963 --> 06:06.463
-Like hell you are.
-I can get to that fire base in minutes.

06:06.547 --> 06:08.047
It'll take this relief column an hour.

06:08.130 --> 06:09.797
Dog soldier's worried about his own kind.

06:09.880 --> 06:12.755
Fuck off! Those are men up there.
Doesn't matter what kind.

06:14.130 --> 06:15.255
-Go.
-[grunts]

06:15.630 --> 06:17.088
[shouting] We'll be right behind you,

06:17.172 --> 06:19.838
and we're plugging anything
that comes down that hill on four legs!

06:24.047 --> 06:24.880
[panting]

06:35.088 --> 06:37.088
[panting]

06:52.380 --> 06:54.755
[electric crackling]

07:07.463 --> 07:10.005
God damn it. Sobieski.

07:25.755 --> 07:27.380
[Commander] Eleven dead.

07:27.963 --> 07:29.713
Torn to shreds.

07:30.838 --> 07:33.505
Taliban's not supposed to have werewolves.

07:33.838 --> 07:36.172
How the fuck did it get past your pal?

07:36.838 --> 07:41.005
He took out Sobieski first, sir,
then moved on to the others.

07:41.963 --> 07:46.297
What use are you people 
if you can't even sniff out your own kind?

07:47.130 --> 07:48.963
I've got his scent now.

07:49.880 --> 07:51.213
I can track him.

07:51.297 --> 07:54.463
[Commander] Good. I want him alive.

08:04.088 --> 08:06.088
[sniffs]

08:12.338 --> 08:13.255
[Decker sniffs]

08:31.172 --> 08:32.297
[sniffs]

08:38.797 --> 08:40.130
You gettin' anything?

08:40.880 --> 08:42.172
Nothing. He isn't here.

08:42.880 --> 08:43.922
[Commander] Shit.

08:45.047 --> 08:47.963
Sodula, you honor me with another meeting.

09:14.005 --> 09:16.005
[sniffing]

09:35.547 --> 09:36.505

-[sniffs]
-[man] Just what the hell are you doing?

12:39.047 --> 12:40.338
You're not a soldier.

12:40.838 --> 12:42.047
You're a fucking animal.

12:44.005 --> 12:48.005
I may be an animal,
but I'm done wearing your leash.

13:57.005 --> 13:58.588
See you in the wild, my friend.  

14:24.838 --> 14:28.713
