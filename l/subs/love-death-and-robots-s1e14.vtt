00:39.672 --> 00:41.630
[woman] <i>Like millions of others,</i>

00:41.713 --> 00:45.463
<i>I'd heard Zima announce</i>
<i>the unveiling of his final work of art.</i>

00:46.630 --> 00:51.338
<i>Over the years, I'd asked many times</i>
<i>for interviews and was always rejected.</i>

00:51.463 --> 00:54.422
<i>Now, for whatever reason, </i>

00:54.547 --> 00:58.505
<i>Zima Blue had requested to speak with me.</i>

00:59.672 --> 01:05.588
<i>I couldn't decide whether the blue was</i>
<i>a closer match to the sky or to the sea.</i>

01:06.380 --> 01:07.630
<i>Neither, really.</i>

01:08.380 --> 01:12.630
<i>Zima Blue, it was a precise thing.</i>

01:14.505 --> 01:17.005
<i>Little is known about Zima's history.</i>

01:17.547 --> 01:21.130
<i>It was said that he started his art career</i>
<i>in portraiture,</i>

01:22.255 --> 01:26.255
<i>but for Zima, the human form</i>
<i>was too small a subject.</i>

01:27.047 --> 01:30.672
<i>The search for deeper meaning</i>
<i>caused him to look further...</i>

01:32.380 --> 01:34.338
<i>to the cosmos itself.</i>

01:36.880 --> 01:39.588
<i>That's how the mural work started.</i>

01:43.172 --> 01:45.963
<i>They were undeniably brilliant.</i>

01:48.588 --> 01:53.213
<i>One day, Zima unveiled a mural</i>
<i>that had something different about it.</i>

01:54.547 --> 01:59.338
<i>In the middle of the canvas</i>
<i>was a tiny blue square.</i>

02:00.047 --> 02:02.172
<i>-The square was just the beginning.</i>
-[crowd murmurs]

02:02.505 --> 02:04.547
[Claire] <i>Over the next several decades,</i>

02:04.630 --> 02:08.213
<i>the abstract shapes changed</i>
<i>and became more dominant.</i>

02:08.797 --> 02:11.963
<i>But, always,</i>
<i>the shade of blue was the same.</i>

02:13.088 --> 02:14.713
<i>It was Zima Blue.</i>

02:15.380 --> 02:21.005
<i>Before very long, Zima unveiled</i>
<i>the first of his entirely blue murals.</i>

02:21.755 --> 02:25.672
<i>It was considered by many to be</i>
<i>as far as Zima could take things.</i>

02:26.755 --> 02:28.713
<i>They couldn't have been more wrong.</i>

02:31.255 --> 02:34.255
<i>When most people speak about</i>
<i>his Blue Period,</i>

02:34.338 --> 02:39.005
<i>they mean the era of</i>
<i>the truly huge murals...</i>

02:40.213 --> 02:43.130
<i>but Zima was just getting started.</i>

02:48.963 --> 02:54.463
<i>It was a certain level of spectacle</i>
<i>that made Zima truly famous,</i>

02:54.880 --> 02:57.463
<i>-even to those with no interest in art.</i>
-[crowd murmurs]

03:00.713 --> 03:02.838
<i>But fame was never the point.</i>

03:06.588 --> 03:11.088
<i>In spite of all his success,</i>
<i>Zima was still dissatisfied</i>

03:12.547 --> 03:18.672
<i>and what he did next was, for many,</i>
<i>too extreme a sacrifice to make for art.</i>

03:27.380 --> 03:29.338
-[Zima] Glad you could make it, Claire.
-[gasps]

03:30.630 --> 03:31.588
How was the flight?

03:33.963 --> 03:35.213
Relax, Claire.

03:36.422 --> 03:37.505
Hi.

03:38.547 --> 03:41.755
Some people find me intimidating,
but they quickly get over it.

03:42.463 --> 03:46.505
It's been over 100 years
since I've spoken to the press.

03:46.588 --> 03:51.047
I've invited you here because
I want you to help me tell my story.

03:52.130 --> 03:54.213
Shall we take a little walk?

03:56.130 --> 04:00.213
[Claire] <i>He was a handsome man,</i>
<i>even after all his transformations.</i>

04:00.922 --> 04:03.380
<i>There was a planet called Kharkov Eight.</i>

04:03.880 --> 04:07.463
<i>It specialized in</i>
<i>illicit cybernetic modifications.</i>

04:09.255 --> 04:13.088
<i>He underwent radical biological procedures</i>

04:13.172 --> 04:16.630
<i>that enabled him to tolerate</i>
<i>extreme environments</i>

04:16.713 --> 04:19.380
<i>without the burden of a protective suit.</i>

04:20.547 --> 04:23.630
<i>His eyes could see in any known spectrum.</i>

04:24.547 --> 04:27.047
<i>He no longer breathed oxygen.</i>

04:27.130 --> 04:31.088
<i>His skin was replaced with</i>
<i>pressurized polymer</i>

04:31.172 --> 04:36.213
<i>and so he ventured forth</i>
<i>to commune with the cosmos.</i>

04:39.422 --> 04:42.172
<i>But what Zima eventually realized</i>

04:42.255 --> 04:45.713
<i>is that the cosmos was already speaking</i>
<i>its own truth</i>

04:46.088 --> 04:48.505
<i>far better than he ever could.</i>

04:53.922 --> 04:56.755
My search for truth has led me here,

04:58.047 --> 05:01.088
to what will be my final piece.

05:02.422 --> 05:06.463
At last, I understand the thing
I sought through my art.

05:07.005 --> 05:10.838
And what does this swimming pool
have to do with that?

05:11.088 --> 05:13.797
It's not just <i>any </i>swimming pool.

05:14.713 --> 05:18.297
Long ago, it belonged to
a talented young woman

05:18.380 --> 05:21.005
with a keen interest
in practical robotics.

05:21.297 --> 05:25.422
<i>She created dozens of robots</i>
<i>to do odd jobs around her house,</i>

05:25.505 --> 05:30.672
<i>but she was especially fond of the one</i>
<i>she'd created to clean her swimming pool.</i>

05:31.172 --> 05:35.922
<i>The little machine toiled endlessly,</i>
<i>scrubbing the ceramic sides of the pool.</i>

05:37.088 --> 05:40.547
<i>But the young woman wasn't satisfied</i>
<i>with the job it did.</i>

05:41.005 --> 05:43.505
<i>So she gave it a full color vision system</i>

05:43.588 --> 05:46.713
<i>and a brain large enough to process</i>
<i>the visual data</i>

05:46.797 --> 05:48.838
<i>into a model of its surroundings.</i>

05:48.922 --> 05:52.380
<i>She gave it the ability</i>
<i>to make its own decisions,</i>

05:52.463 --> 05:55.213
<i>to design different strategies</i>
<i>for cleaning the pool.</i>

05:55.838 --> 06:00.338
<i>She continued to use the machine as</i>
<i>a test-bed for new hardware and software.</i>

06:01.130 --> 06:04.088
<i>And by stages, it became more aware.</i>

06:04.172 --> 06:06.755
<i>Eventually, the woman died.</i>

06:07.005 --> 06:08.713
<i>The little machine was passed</i>

06:08.797 --> 06:11.047
<i>-from one owner to the next.</i>
-[electronic whirring]

06:11.588 --> 06:15.338
<i>They added things,</i>
<i>made modifications here and there</i>

06:16.005 --> 06:19.755
<i>and with every iteration,</i>
<i>it became more alive.</i>

06:20.338 --> 06:22.380
<i>Became more...</i>

06:22.922 --> 06:23.880
me.

06:24.880 --> 06:27.797
-[gasps]
-This is that same pool.

06:28.172 --> 06:30.255
I had it dug up. Moved here.

06:31.297 --> 06:37.172
But you're a man with machine parts,
not a machine that thinks it's a man.

06:37.255 --> 06:41.297
Sometimes, it's difficult even for me
to understand what I've become.

06:41.797 --> 06:45.463
And harder still
to remember what I once was.

06:46.088 --> 06:46.922
[exhales]

06:47.547 --> 06:49.922
The blue of the tiles...

06:50.422 --> 06:53.547
Zima Blue, the manufacturer called it.

06:54.380 --> 06:56.630
The first thing I ever saw.

06:57.130 --> 06:59.088
This was where I began.

06:59.297 --> 07:03.297
A crude little machine with barely enough
intelligence to steer itself.

07:04.130 --> 07:05.797
But it was my world.

07:06.088 --> 07:10.338
It was all I knew, all I needed to know.

07:11.505 --> 07:12.630
And now?

07:27.922 --> 07:29.838
[crowd gasps]

07:29.922 --> 07:33.130
[cheering]

07:46.047 --> 07:47.797
[Zima] <i>I will immerse myself.</i>

07:47.880 --> 07:49.213
[cameras click]

07:55.422 --> 07:59.963
<i>And as I do, I will slowly shut down</i>
<i>my higher brain functions...</i>

08:05.797 --> 08:06.880
[crowd gasps]

08:09.838 --> 08:11.838
<i>un-making myself...</i>

08:15.588 --> 08:17.255
[gasps]

08:19.297 --> 08:22.630
<i>leaving just enough</i>
<i>to appreciate my surroundings...</i>

08:30.422 --> 08:35.797
<i>to extract some simple pleasure from</i>
<i>the execution of a task well done.</i>

08:37.005 --> 08:39.880
<i>My search for truth is finished at last.</i>

08:39.963 --> 08:41.338
[gasps]

08:44.088 --> 08:45.797
<i>I'm going home.</i>
