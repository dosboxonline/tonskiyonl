00:08.916 --> 00:10.500
[Disa] <i>A mountain's like a person.</i>

00:10.500 --> 00:14.000
<i>Sing to it properly,
it will reflect your song back to you,</i>

00:14.000 --> 00:16.250
<i>showing you where to mine,
where to tunnel...</i>

00:16.250 --> 00:18.375
And where to leave the mountain untouched.

00:21.000 --> 00:21.958
[Prince Durin IV] <i>Father...</i>

00:21.958 --> 00:23.833
<i>It's more than we ever imagined.</i>

00:23.833 --> 00:26.166
- King Durin, there is a...
- Enough!

00:26.166 --> 00:27.416
<i>Seize the Elf.</i>

00:28.375 --> 00:30.916
[Prince Durin IV]
<i>Elrond is as much a brother to me</i>

00:30.916 --> 00:34.250
as if he'd been fired
in my own mother's womb.

00:34.250 --> 00:36.041
[yells] How dare you!

00:36.041 --> 00:38.166
Invoke your mother's memory

00:38.166 --> 00:41.333
to defend your decision
to betray your own kind?

00:41.333 --> 00:43.625
It's you that's betrayed our kind!

00:43.625 --> 00:46.041
You profane the crown you wear!

00:46.625 --> 00:47.458
[metal clinks]

00:47.458 --> 00:48.583
[echoing clang]

00:49.875 --> 00:51.250
Leave it.

00:51.250 --> 00:52.750
It's not yours anymore.

00:55.125 --> 00:57.458
[Stranger] <i>From shadow you came.</i>

00:57.458 --> 01:00.083
To shadow I bid you return!

01:01.250 --> 01:03.125
[screams]

01:03.750 --> 01:04.750
[acolytes scream]

01:04.750 --> 01:07.625
You had that dream again last night,
didn't you?

01:07.625 --> 01:10.000
[Stranger] <i>In the dream,
there's a kind of... branch.</i>

01:10.000 --> 01:11.375
<i>Under the stars.</i>

01:11.375 --> 01:12.958
[indistinct whispering]

01:14.125 --> 01:15.500
<i>It appears we're being followed.</i>

01:16.791 --> 01:17.625
[groans softly]

01:17.625 --> 01:19.583
[Poppy] <i>I was
sifting through Sadoc's old book.</i>

01:19.583 --> 01:21.541
I think it's some kinda directions.

01:21.541 --> 01:23.583
Welcome to the lands of RhÃ»n.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.500
Why you looking at it like that?

01:25.500 --> 01:27.041
Like you've been here before.

01:27.041 --> 01:28.416
[Stranger] <i>Only in dreams.</i>

01:31.916 --> 01:33.250
[horse whinnies]

01:34.458 --> 01:35.625
Tell me your name.

01:35.625 --> 01:38.208
- I have had many names.
- [grunts]

01:38.208 --> 01:39.541
[Elrond] <i>Where is Halbrand?</i>

01:39.541 --> 01:42.500
[Galadriel] <i>He is gone.
And I doubt he will return.</i>

01:42.500 --> 01:45.583
And should he ever,
none of us are to treat with him again.

01:45.583 --> 01:49.833
Elrond just informed me your companion
was not who he claimed.

01:49.833 --> 01:51.083
[Galadriel] He is not what I thought.

01:51.083 --> 01:52.666
He is Sauron.

01:52.666 --> 01:55.916
[Gil-galad] <i>It is to be given directly
to Lord Celebrimbor.</i>

01:56.500 --> 02:00.291
<i>He must be informed
that Halbrand is Sauron.</i>

02:00.291 --> 02:03.333
[Mirdania] <i>Forgive me, my lord,
but a messenger has just arrived.</i>

02:03.833 --> 02:05.416
<i>Do we grant him entry?</i>

02:09.291 --> 02:10.666
[rumbling]

02:19.125 --> 02:22.916
[whooshing]

02:22.916 --> 02:24.875
[sinister music playing]

03:10.583 --> 03:12.208
[music crescendoes, ends]

03:12.208 --> 03:14.083
[indistinct chatter]

03:20.291 --> 03:24.583
- Mole-tail stew, mole-tail stew...
- Oh.

03:24.583 --> 03:26.041
Wait.

03:26.041 --> 03:27.750
- Too dear.
- What?

03:28.625 --> 03:30.333
We're not paupers.

03:30.333 --> 03:33.291
You're the one said we'd be wise
to tighten our purse strings.

03:33.291 --> 03:36.375
Or were you not including yourself
when you said that?

03:37.166 --> 03:38.125
Hmm?

03:42.416 --> 03:44.041
You married a prince.

03:45.583 --> 03:47.583
But now you're bound to an outcast.

03:51.625 --> 03:54.625
I'm bound to the Dwarf I love.

03:56.791 --> 04:01.791
And I wouldn't trade his heart
for a mine full of fire opals.

04:05.125 --> 04:06.166
[sighs softly]

04:08.708 --> 04:10.458
Be nice to have the opals, though.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.375
- [Disa] Aye. It would.
- [chuckles]

04:12.375 --> 04:14.000
[chuckles softly]

04:14.000 --> 04:16.083
Have you tried to talk to your father--

04:16.083 --> 04:19.500
Disa, you know
he will never agree to see me.

04:19.500 --> 04:20.875
That's not what I asked.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.666
Why should I be the one
to ask for an audience?

04:23.666 --> 04:25.541
- He disowned me!
- [rumbling]

04:25.541 --> 04:28.125
[Prince Durin IV]
He's as stubborn as a stone leg.

04:28.125 --> 04:30.458
[muffled] You're gonna have better luck
tryna bend a brick.

04:31.291 --> 04:32.458
You may as well f--

04:32.458 --> 04:33.541
Disa?

04:34.833 --> 04:35.833
Brace yourself.

04:35.833 --> 04:38.583
[rattling and rumbling]

04:38.583 --> 04:40.791
I said brace yourselves!

04:40.791 --> 04:42.000
Disa!

04:42.000 --> 04:44.041
[all screaming]

04:49.958 --> 04:52.708
[people screaming]

04:59.708 --> 05:03.083
[Disa whimpers softly]

05:05.541 --> 05:06.791
[chuckles]

05:06.791 --> 05:08.208
[both grunting]

05:09.166 --> 05:11.333
- [rumbling subsides]
- [screaming dies down]

05:11.333 --> 05:13.000
- [both panting]
- [indistinct, panicked chatter]

05:18.041 --> 05:19.625
[rumbling]

05:19.625 --> 05:22.833
[ominous music playing]

05:25.541 --> 05:26.750
Durin.

05:28.708 --> 05:29.708
No.

05:31.541 --> 05:32.666
No, no, no, no.

05:38.500 --> 05:41.458
[opening theme music playing]

07:07.916 --> 07:09.458
[rustling]

07:09.458 --> 07:10.791
[birds chirping]

07:15.500 --> 07:19.125
[in Sindarin] These lands shall bear you

07:19.125 --> 07:22.750
sweet blossoms once more.

07:29.041 --> 07:30.500
[in English] My dear brother.

07:39.291 --> 07:40.666
[footsteps approaching]

07:44.291 --> 07:45.541
[Galadriel] Lord Celebrimbor.

07:47.416 --> 07:49.333
They did not tell me you had arrived.

07:52.125 --> 07:53.333
What news?

07:53.333 --> 07:55.625
I've had an unexpected visitor.

07:57.541 --> 07:58.583
[sinister music playing]

07:58.583 --> 08:00.666
He has returned already?

08:04.291 --> 08:07.083
[Halbrand, echoing] Galadriel?
Galadriel? Galadriel?

08:07.083 --> 08:10.250
[wood creaking]

08:12.000 --> 08:14.125
[twigs, leaves rustling]

08:22.500 --> 08:25.083
Are they not the seeds you planted?

08:26.791 --> 08:27.916
[exclaims]

08:28.291 --> 08:33.125
[in Black Speech, distorted] Three rings
for the Elven-kings under the sky.

08:33.916 --> 08:38.375
Seven for the Dwarf-lords
in their halls of stone.

08:38.375 --> 08:43.541
Nine for mortal men
doomed to die. [grunts]

08:43.541 --> 08:45.125
[screams]

08:56.583 --> 08:59.083
[commander of the West]
We should attack Mordor from the north.

08:59.083 --> 09:02.000
We enter here, between the Ered Lithui
and the Ephel Arnen.

09:02.458 --> 09:05.416
[commander of the East] It would be wiser
to attack Adar from the east.

09:06.666 --> 09:08.833
What of the whereabouts of Sauron?

09:08.833 --> 09:13.083
Our spies indicate that Sauron
was last seen traveling into Mordor.

09:13.916 --> 09:17.500
We believe he intends to supplant Adar
and claim his armies.

09:17.500 --> 09:19.375
If we move swiftly,

09:19.375 --> 09:22.541
we may be able
to crush two spiders with one boot.

09:22.541 --> 09:24.958
And what says the Commander
of the Northern Armies?

09:25.916 --> 09:27.125
- Galadriel?
- [gasps]

09:27.916 --> 09:30.375
[voice shaking]

09:30.375 --> 09:33.791
Um, we should send ships up the Anduin,

09:34.625 --> 09:37.500
invade Mordor from the west.

09:42.416 --> 09:43.958
See to the preparations.

09:52.250 --> 09:54.375
It does not take the eye of an eagle

09:54.375 --> 09:57.458
to see your thoughts
have flown far afield.

09:57.458 --> 09:59.500
What troubles them?

10:01.375 --> 10:03.625
Sauron may well have traveled to Mordor,

10:05.625 --> 10:07.791
but we cannot be certain
that is where he remains.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.458
What makes you say that?

10:12.041 --> 10:13.166
Sauron...

10:15.000 --> 10:17.791
sees himself
not as master of a barren waste,

10:18.958 --> 10:20.750
but of all Middle-earth.

10:23.416 --> 10:26.000
He seeks to rule it
not only through conquest,

10:26.500 --> 10:31.000
but by bending the minds and wills
of all its peoples to his own.

10:31.583 --> 10:33.333
And for that, he needs not armies...

10:35.333 --> 10:36.583
but Rings.

10:37.333 --> 10:40.583
And he cannot craft them
without Celebrimbor.

10:40.583 --> 10:45.666
Sauron is alone, without army or ally.

10:46.208 --> 10:49.916
Eregion is protected by two rivers

10:49.916 --> 10:55.250
with miles of curtain wall
of dwarven stone, ten-foot thick.

10:56.916 --> 11:01.625
Rest assured,
Celebrimbor and the secrets of his craft

11:02.416 --> 11:03.416
are safe.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.500
[thunder rumbling]

11:12.500 --> 11:14.083
[foreboding music plays]

11:22.208 --> 11:27.708
I tell you,
some veiled evil closes in on Celebrimbor.

11:28.708 --> 11:32.250
Sauron's plan is in motion even now.

11:32.833 --> 11:33.958
I know it.

11:35.666 --> 11:36.875
How?

11:39.916 --> 11:42.500
Since the wearing of this Ring,
I have felt...

11:44.166 --> 11:45.375
perceived...

11:46.541 --> 11:48.750
glimpses of the unseen world...

11:50.916 --> 11:54.541
as dreams unbidden,
coming forth to crowd my waking mind.

11:56.041 --> 11:58.458
You believe the Rings
have kindled your ability

11:58.458 --> 12:01.416
to see that
which has not yet come to pass?

12:04.291 --> 12:05.875
Have they kindled yours?

12:10.375 --> 12:12.541
I have seen mountains crumbling.

12:13.583 --> 12:18.375
Waters running dry. And clouds. Black.
Gathering over white towers.

12:18.375 --> 12:21.291
- Then send me to Eregion.
- Galadriel--

12:21.291 --> 12:24.625
- If Sauron is there, I will send word--
- You cannot face Sauron again.

12:26.875 --> 12:31.125
It is said that once the Deceiver
obtains a being's trust,

12:31.125 --> 12:34.500
he gains the ability
to sculpt their very thoughts.

12:35.083 --> 12:39.208
To deceive not only their heart and mind,
but their eyes and ears.

12:39.208 --> 12:41.708
To alter their very reality.

12:43.041 --> 12:45.250
You have already been affected once.

12:48.250 --> 12:49.208
Yes.

12:50.791 --> 12:52.208
He knows my mind.

12:53.875 --> 12:55.333
And I know his.

12:56.416 --> 12:58.541
Which is why I must face him.

12:59.416 --> 13:01.708
Why I alone can slay him.

13:01.708 --> 13:04.208
You once considered him a friend.

13:04.208 --> 13:06.458
- Halbrand was not a--
- Sauron.

13:07.875 --> 13:09.750
You cannot face him alone.

13:12.125 --> 13:14.958
Supposing... I was not alone?

13:15.583 --> 13:17.958
[bell tolling]

13:17.958 --> 13:19.458
[ethereal operatic music playing]

13:28.541 --> 13:30.625
[indistinct chatter]

13:38.750 --> 13:43.166
Lord Celebrimbor regrets to inform you
he's unable to grant you entry.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.708
Mightn't I speak with him directly?

13:46.708 --> 13:48.083
[Mirdania] My lord is occupied.

13:48.083 --> 13:50.583
But he wishes you good fortune
on your journey.

13:51.166 --> 13:52.833
Are you asking me to leave?

13:55.125 --> 13:57.750
The Lord of Eregion is asking you.

14:00.166 --> 14:02.375
Perhaps I'll just wait here.

14:06.625 --> 14:08.375
Just in case he changes his mind.

14:23.791 --> 14:24.625
Is he gone?

14:24.625 --> 14:27.208
No. He refuses to leave, my lord.

14:30.625 --> 14:32.291
Well, he can refuse all he cares to.

14:32.291 --> 14:36.458
I promised Lady Galadriel before she left
that I would never treat with him again.

14:40.708 --> 14:42.125
Was there something more?

14:42.125 --> 14:44.375
I believe he's injured, my lord.

14:45.708 --> 14:46.916
Let him be.

14:48.583 --> 14:49.583
He'll leave soon enough.

14:50.541 --> 14:53.541
Messengers from Lindon
should arrive with news any day.

14:56.500 --> 14:58.166
[flies buzzing]

14:58.166 --> 14:59.750
[dramatic music playing]

15:04.041 --> 15:05.458
[chains clinking, rattling]

15:35.541 --> 15:38.166
[dramatic music swells]

16:06.833 --> 16:07.875
[horse snorts]

16:28.916 --> 16:29.875
[wings fluttering]

16:36.250 --> 16:38.291
[chittering]

17:08.000 --> 17:10.000
[ominous music playing]

17:47.000 --> 17:49.416
[disembodied voices
whispering indistinctly]

18:23.250 --> 18:25.708
What tidings from the white wings?

18:26.291 --> 18:28.291
Sauron's shadow is deepening.

18:29.041 --> 18:33.541
It is said he has taken a new form
to deceive his enemies.

18:33.541 --> 18:34.583
And the <i>Istar?</i>

18:35.583 --> 18:41.375
I hear whispers from salt scavengers
and <i>mÃ»makil</i> thieves.

18:42.375 --> 18:48.375
Whispers of an old man in rags,
traveling east with two halflings.

18:48.375 --> 18:50.375
He is lost. Vulnerable.

18:50.375 --> 18:52.666
[Dark Wizard] But he will not be for long.

18:52.666 --> 18:55.916
We must reach him before he learns
to harness his powers.

18:56.833 --> 19:00.666
Perhaps, the blood I wasted
to bring you before me

19:00.666 --> 19:05.416
should have been spent
on more useful servants.

19:06.291 --> 19:08.500
[stone door slides open]

19:11.375 --> 19:12.916
[female messenger acolyte] Master.

19:12.916 --> 19:15.750
One of the trackers
you sent out has returned.

19:19.208 --> 19:20.541
[Dark Wizard] Have you found him?

19:20.541 --> 19:23.833
[BrÃ¤nk] I didn't just find him.
I know how to capture him.

19:23.833 --> 19:29.541
Heal the curse upon our flesh,
and I will bring you the <i>Istar</i> in chains.

19:30.125 --> 19:35.166
What makes you think a mortal
like yourself

19:35.166 --> 19:37.458
could defeat an <i>Istar</i>

19:37.458 --> 19:41.833
when my most powerful acolytes could not?

19:42.583 --> 19:47.666
[BrÃ¤nk] The <i>Istar</i> will surrender to me,
because if he doesn't,

19:47.666 --> 19:51.666
I will slaughter
the halflings he calls friends.

19:55.291 --> 19:58.041
What about Doderick?

20:00.458 --> 20:01.750
Doderick?

20:01.750 --> 20:04.875
[Nori] All right, all right. Andwise?

20:04.875 --> 20:08.791
[Stranger] It is a fine name.
Nevertheless, it is not going to be mine.

20:10.166 --> 20:11.208
I know.

20:12.125 --> 20:13.000
Fredagard.

20:15.750 --> 20:16.833
But don't you see?

20:17.958 --> 20:20.166
No one can give you a name.

20:21.500 --> 20:22.833
It is yours already.

20:24.333 --> 20:25.875
It is who you are.

20:27.916 --> 20:33.125
And when you hear it spoken,
you feel your heart glow.

20:34.291 --> 20:36.000
You'll hear it one day.

20:38.333 --> 20:39.375
I'm sure of it.

20:40.875 --> 20:42.291
We'll find out who you are.

20:44.916 --> 20:46.000
[Poppy] I knew it!

20:46.000 --> 20:47.625
Says here if we turn northeast,

20:47.625 --> 20:50.125
we can cut this leg
of the journey in half.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.708
Over there. Come on!

20:52.708 --> 20:54.916
[captivating music playing]

21:08.791 --> 21:10.708
[Stranger] My preference
would be to avoid the path

21:10.708 --> 21:12.833
on which we would
run out of water the first day

21:12.833 --> 21:15.125
and die of heat the second.

21:16.583 --> 21:18.666
But perhaps that is just me?

21:23.041 --> 21:24.708
How about Doderick?

21:26.166 --> 21:27.791
You already said Doderick.

21:30.208 --> 21:31.375
No, I didn't.

21:31.375 --> 21:33.166
- [Stranger] Yes, you did.
- [Poppy] Yes, you did.

21:36.708 --> 21:39.375
Ah, how fares the forager this time?

21:40.291 --> 21:43.208
All I found was a scorpion
and a clump of cactus.

21:43.833 --> 21:47.208
The scorpion stung me,
I fell over, and, well... [clears throat]

21:47.208 --> 21:50.000
- That's how I found the cactus.
- That's how you found the cactus.

21:51.375 --> 21:56.000
Couldn't you just, I don't know,
magic some more water into being?

21:58.500 --> 22:02.041
He's afraid he'd lose control again
without a <i>gand.</i>

22:02.583 --> 22:05.000
So we find a <i>gand.</i>
S'plenty of sticks all over the place.

22:05.541 --> 22:07.041
Don't think it works that way, Pop.

22:07.541 --> 22:08.750
Silence.

22:09.708 --> 22:10.791
[horses approaching]

22:10.791 --> 22:11.875
What is it?

22:14.083 --> 22:16.916
On the wind. Can you hear that?

22:18.541 --> 22:20.333
- Almost sounds like--
- Hooves.

22:21.458 --> 22:23.375
[horse chuffs]

22:30.625 --> 22:31.500
[Nori grunts]

22:35.750 --> 22:36.875
[grunts]

22:39.833 --> 22:42.500
[breathing heavily]

23:01.083 --> 23:03.166
[breath trembling]

23:07.750 --> 23:11.416
[snake rattling and hissing]

23:15.208 --> 23:17.250
[hissing]

23:23.041 --> 23:25.541
[Kilta breathing heavily]

23:32.083 --> 23:34.958
[Kilta] They're still close. Mount up!

23:37.416 --> 23:40.750
[Poppy breathing heavily]

23:45.541 --> 23:47.000
[Poppy] Who were they?

23:48.791 --> 23:49.916
[Stranger] I don't know.

23:51.083 --> 23:52.541
They're watching our trail.

23:53.416 --> 23:55.583
Meaning, we'd be wise to find another.

23:59.000 --> 24:00.333
We already have.

24:08.375 --> 24:09.583
Nobody goes off-trail.

24:10.541 --> 24:13.041
- Nobody walks alone.
- Nobody walks alone.

24:33.250 --> 24:35.833
[female stone singer 1] Every garden
has withered since the earthquake.

24:35.833 --> 24:37.666
[female stone singer 2]
It's not just the gardens.

24:37.666 --> 24:42.041
Rumors abound of dark omens
across all the Dwarven realms.

24:43.166 --> 24:47.125
Some say the mountain was cursed
when the prince let in that Elf.

24:47.125 --> 24:49.875
You two wouldn't be trafficking
in conjecture, would you?

24:49.875 --> 24:51.416
- No.
- Wouldn't dream of it.

24:51.416 --> 24:54.083
Good. 'Cause a rumor's like a songbird.

24:54.083 --> 24:58.250
May sound filling from afar,
but up close, it's an empty feast.

24:58.958 --> 25:00.291
Then it isn't true?

25:00.958 --> 25:03.083
That something terrible is happening?

25:04.500 --> 25:07.041
We're about to prove it isn't.

25:18.833 --> 25:20.458
- [Disa] King Durin.
- [both] King Durin.

25:20.458 --> 25:21.833
Disa.

25:23.375 --> 25:24.916
Narvi, your report?

25:25.791 --> 25:27.333
[grunts] Sire.

25:28.875 --> 25:31.958
Not long ago, a fire-mountain awoke.

25:32.625 --> 25:36.833
And although it resides far to our south,

25:36.833 --> 25:39.625
the ground-shakes it produced

25:39.625 --> 25:44.208
spread through the bones of the earth
all the way here,

25:44.208 --> 25:46.208
collapsing our sun-shafts,

25:47.125 --> 25:50.666
and with them, our ability to grow crops.

25:51.291 --> 25:52.125
[grunts]

25:54.208 --> 25:56.958
Now, the obvious remedy

25:56.958 --> 25:59.708
is to set the dig-teams
to work repairing the shafts

25:59.708 --> 26:02.250
and sinking new ones. However--

26:02.250 --> 26:07.208
Every Stone-singer you've brought here
has failed to identify a safe path to dig.

26:07.208 --> 26:09.041
I'm afraid that's true.

26:11.791 --> 26:15.291
With your approval, sire,
we will find the light.

26:15.291 --> 26:16.625
You have it.

26:27.041 --> 26:28.541
[all singing in Khuzdul]

26:47.875 --> 26:50.041
[rumbling]

26:56.083 --> 26:58.041
[thudding]

27:17.125 --> 27:18.791
[singing subsides]

27:21.791 --> 27:23.291
[grunts]

27:23.291 --> 27:25.166
[King Durin] For nine centuries,

27:27.000 --> 27:32.375
the Stone-singers have fostered
our sacred connection to this rock.

27:34.041 --> 27:38.791
And in all those years, not once,

27:38.791 --> 27:44.875
not once have they ever ceased
to provide for us.

27:48.541 --> 27:52.916
But now, whatever the cause,

27:55.708 --> 27:57.500
the bond is broken.

27:57.500 --> 28:01.583
The hand of darkness
has closed around Khazad-dÃ»m.

28:01.583 --> 28:03.541
Dig carefully, Delve-master.

28:08.458 --> 28:09.375
[sighs wearily]

28:18.875 --> 28:20.208
Disa.

28:22.125 --> 28:23.291
A moment?

28:32.875 --> 28:34.791
Are you really going to make me ask?

28:36.208 --> 28:39.041
Do you mean your grandchildren?
They're well.

28:39.041 --> 28:41.125
They miss tugging your beard,
of course, but--

28:41.125 --> 28:44.416
You needn't make this harder
than it already is.

28:45.458 --> 28:48.125
Funny. I keep saying
the same thing to him.

28:49.958 --> 28:53.000
Surely Durin knows I spoke in anger!

28:53.000 --> 28:56.166
If that's an apology I hear, King,
try saying it to my husband.

28:56.166 --> 28:58.458
Why should it be me who apologizes?

28:59.666 --> 29:01.500
It was he who caused offense!

29:02.958 --> 29:04.125
I tell you, he's--

29:04.125 --> 29:07.125
Stubborn as a root-bound parsnip?

29:08.458 --> 29:11.041
One more quality the two of you
have in common.

29:12.250 --> 29:14.541
What you call "stubbornness,"

29:15.625 --> 29:18.291
some Dwarves call "strength."

29:19.375 --> 29:24.875
Oh, I imagine it does take strength
to carry a grudge so heavy.

29:26.375 --> 29:30.833
To keep your wounded heart
so tightly bound, it can barely beat.

29:33.041 --> 29:34.291
Aye, it does.

29:38.000 --> 29:39.416
It truly does.

29:45.166 --> 29:47.875
No wonder we can't hear the mountain.

29:47.875 --> 29:50.875
Its King is deaf to the sorrow
of his own son.

29:50.875 --> 29:52.375
Still your axe, Disa!

29:52.375 --> 29:55.291
[Disa] You want to show true strength?

29:56.166 --> 29:58.041
Summon your son to you.

30:00.208 --> 30:01.541
He'll answer.

30:03.166 --> 30:07.458
But leave it to him
and the peaks of Zirakzigil will thaw

30:07.458 --> 30:09.375
before this feud of yours will.

30:13.708 --> 30:16.000
- [pickaxes clinking]
- [miners grunting]

30:16.000 --> 30:17.416
[miner 1] No sunlight yet.

30:18.166 --> 30:19.250
[clanks]

30:19.250 --> 30:20.625
[miner 2] Another dead end.

30:21.458 --> 30:22.958
We're gonna have to work all night.

30:22.958 --> 30:26.041
- [Prince Durin IV, breathing heavily]
- Oh, here we go.

30:26.041 --> 30:27.333
[scoffing]

30:27.333 --> 30:31.583
Growing blisters, I see.
No shame in it. Even I've had 'em.

30:32.375 --> 30:35.416
- Oh, y'have?
- [Barduk] Aye. When I was five!

30:35.416 --> 30:36.916
[both laugh]

30:36.916 --> 30:38.541
Aye, palace hands.

30:38.541 --> 30:40.708
Been polishing jewels all his life.

30:40.708 --> 30:42.416
[miners chuckling]

30:42.416 --> 30:45.291
Don't fret, Prince, only 13 hours to go.

30:45.291 --> 30:48.541
Aye. It's his fault we're in this mess.

30:48.541 --> 30:49.750
And his father.

30:50.833 --> 30:51.833
Eh?

30:54.208 --> 30:57.958
Lay a finger on me again,
I'll bite it off at the knuckle.

30:57.958 --> 30:59.666
[miners chuckling]

31:05.750 --> 31:06.583
[Barduk grunts]

31:07.250 --> 31:08.500
- [grunts]
- [miners laughing]

31:08.500 --> 31:09.416
[sighs]

31:09.416 --> 31:10.958
[melancholic music playing]

31:20.916 --> 31:22.083
How was the mine?

31:26.458 --> 31:27.458
'Bout the same.

31:30.625 --> 31:32.041
Where are the weans?

31:32.041 --> 31:34.333
Said they weren't hungry. Again.

31:34.791 --> 31:36.041
Well, I can't blame 'em.

31:36.833 --> 31:39.125
This rye tastes like last year's bread.

31:39.125 --> 31:40.791
It is last year's bread.

31:42.416 --> 31:45.083
Why not trade for fresh grain
from the surface?

31:45.791 --> 31:47.416
Splendid idea!

31:47.416 --> 31:51.125
But who in the Dimrill Dale will we find
to convince your father of it?

31:51.125 --> 31:53.708
- Don't start.
- Um... Let me think...

31:53.708 --> 31:54.916
I said don't.

31:54.916 --> 31:57.583
Ah, climb off your high peak
and apologize!

31:57.583 --> 32:00.541
- You're giving me indigestion.
- Good! Now listen to your guts!

32:00.541 --> 32:01.875
I am!

32:02.583 --> 32:05.125
And they still say I was right.

32:05.125 --> 32:08.541
If he hadn't have
thrown Elrond out to rot,

32:08.541 --> 32:10.708
we'd have food enough for 500 years!

32:10.708 --> 32:12.875
You think this is about food?

32:15.958 --> 32:18.791
We can't hear the mountains anymore.

32:25.000 --> 32:26.750
I'm afraid, Durin.

32:29.541 --> 32:30.833
I'm afraid.

32:31.750 --> 32:34.916
Disa... Come here.

32:36.875 --> 32:39.166
[Disa sighs heavily]

32:42.000 --> 32:43.416
We're Dwarves.

32:44.541 --> 32:45.958
We'll find a way.

32:48.458 --> 32:50.083
We always have.

32:51.375 --> 32:52.541
How?

33:03.458 --> 33:05.125
[indistinct chatter]

33:17.166 --> 33:21.333
[Galadriel] Our letters to Celebrimbor
have all gone unanswered.

33:21.333 --> 33:23.458
I fear Sauron may be in Eregion.

33:24.750 --> 33:27.750
The High King has consented
to send me and a small party there,

33:28.583 --> 33:30.791
to ensure Celebrimbor
and his city are safe.

33:32.916 --> 33:34.708
I'm asking you to join us.

33:35.583 --> 33:36.458
[scoffs]

33:37.708 --> 33:40.250
As you are so fond
of reminding me, Galadriel,

33:42.125 --> 33:43.416
I am but a politician.

33:43.416 --> 33:45.750
And as such,
you have the High King's trust.

33:47.375 --> 33:48.833
He believes in your steadfastness.

33:48.833 --> 33:52.416
A dog is steadfast.
And quicker to follow on a leash.

33:59.416 --> 34:01.250
He refuses to send me without you.

34:03.833 --> 34:05.000
[Elrond] And why is that?

34:05.750 --> 34:08.166
- You know the reason.
- I'm asking if you know it.

34:10.166 --> 34:15.083
The High King believes,
that if I were to face the Enemy alone,

34:16.291 --> 34:18.041
I may be vulnerable to deception.

34:18.583 --> 34:20.000
And why would he think that?

34:20.000 --> 34:21.041
Stop it, Elrond.

34:23.375 --> 34:25.291
[Elrond] You've defied
the High King's orders before.

34:25.291 --> 34:26.875
Why not do so now?

34:28.458 --> 34:29.791
Because he is right.

34:31.000 --> 34:32.375
Sauron used me.

34:33.000 --> 34:37.041
And under his hand, I was played like
a harp to a melody not of my choosing.

34:38.916 --> 34:40.916
It was entirely of your choosing.

34:43.083 --> 34:44.875
Sauron looked inside you,

34:44.875 --> 34:48.000
plucked the very song of your soul,
note by note,

34:49.208 --> 34:51.375
making himself out to be
exactly what you needed.

34:51.375 --> 34:53.458
"The Lost King"
who could ride you to victory.

34:53.458 --> 34:56.250
You gave him everything he wanted
and then thanked him for it.

34:56.250 --> 34:58.250
And now he has done the same to Gil-galad.

34:58.250 --> 34:59.791
And to every Elf in Lindon.

35:00.958 --> 35:04.291
And that is why we need you.
Help us navigate this labyrinth.

35:04.291 --> 35:06.041
[Elrond] There is no navigating it.

35:06.041 --> 35:08.041
The labyrinth is his.

35:09.416 --> 35:11.958
As long as you stay in it,
you've already lost.

35:13.333 --> 35:16.625
- He may well want you in Eregion--
- Please, Elrond.

35:18.833 --> 35:20.791
I cannot let him in again.

35:22.500 --> 35:23.875
I cannot.

35:46.041 --> 35:48.500
He never left, Galadriel.

35:50.416 --> 35:52.750
In choosing to wear those Rings,

35:53.750 --> 35:56.583
you have all chosen
to become his collaborators.

35:58.291 --> 36:00.083
I will have no part in it.

36:01.708 --> 36:03.208
You promised me once,

36:04.875 --> 36:08.458
"If but a whisper of a rumor"
of what I feared proved true,

36:09.666 --> 36:11.833
you would not rest until it was put right.

36:14.583 --> 36:16.833
If our friendship
ever meant anything to you,

36:19.708 --> 36:20.708
please leave.

36:49.166 --> 36:50.875
[CÃ­rdan] <i>Do you not wish
to live in beauty?</i>

36:51.958 --> 36:54.791
[Elrond] Master CÃ­rdan,
I cannot trust these Rings.

36:54.791 --> 36:57.583
What is beauty, when it is born,
in part, of evil?

36:58.125 --> 36:59.541
No less beautiful.

37:01.416 --> 37:02.583
Not to me.

37:02.583 --> 37:05.416
Would you cast RÃºmil's verses
into the flame,

37:05.416 --> 37:07.166
because the poet was a drunkard?

37:13.250 --> 37:14.625
RÃºmil was a drunkard?

37:15.541 --> 37:16.375
[chuckles softly]

37:16.916 --> 37:19.541
Do not ask of Daeron. [scoffs]

37:20.500 --> 37:21.791
Insufferable.

37:23.041 --> 37:24.791
But a voice,

37:24.791 --> 37:29.750
a voice that could make
the very sun weep tears of fire.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.375
Judge the work,

37:36.375 --> 37:38.875
and leave judgment
concerning those who wrought it

37:38.875 --> 37:41.833
to the judge who sees all things.

37:41.833 --> 37:43.791
That feels impossible.

37:45.958 --> 37:47.458
It is called humility.

37:47.458 --> 37:49.791
And it is difficult for most.

37:49.791 --> 37:52.250
But it is the truest form of sight.

38:03.458 --> 38:07.125
I wish I could know your peace.

38:09.541 --> 38:10.791
You can.

38:17.625 --> 38:20.958
We do not yet fully understand
these Rings.

38:20.958 --> 38:24.875
But look at the power they exert
over every form of life.

38:31.250 --> 38:35.833
In Sauron's hands,
they could work an evil beyond reckoning,

38:35.833 --> 38:38.750
dominating the minds and wills of all.

38:39.291 --> 38:43.166
This is why they must remain
in the hands of Elves.

38:45.666 --> 38:49.458
You are wise to fear this power, Elrond.

38:51.875 --> 38:56.875
But do not let that fear blind you
to the ways it can be used for good.

38:59.666 --> 39:02.000
For it is not your enemy,
that bears these Rings...

39:04.125 --> 39:08.083
But your most trusted friends.

39:08.708 --> 39:12.708
If you believe they have strayed,
do not abandon them,

39:12.708 --> 39:17.875
but rather open your eyes
and guide them...

39:18.541 --> 39:22.208
Before the darkness
spreads across Middle-earth,

39:22.208 --> 39:24.625
and blinds us all.

39:26.416 --> 39:27.791
[wind whistling]

39:29.958 --> 39:32.000
[all panting]

39:46.750 --> 39:48.666
[grunting]

39:57.500 --> 39:58.916
You need to rest.

40:00.541 --> 40:03.291
[pants] Certainly not, I...

40:04.375 --> 40:05.208
[grunts]

40:05.916 --> 40:07.083
[Nori panting]

40:09.958 --> 40:11.166
Wake up!

40:11.166 --> 40:12.333
[grunts]

40:14.833 --> 40:17.416
What are you doin'? Get back here!

40:17.416 --> 40:19.500
[Poppy] I saw it. I know I saw it. C'mon.

40:19.500 --> 40:21.291
[Nori] Poppy, he's not breathin' anymore!

40:23.666 --> 40:25.833
There! Yes! Nori, I can see it!

40:26.541 --> 40:27.958
[Nori] See what?

40:27.958 --> 40:29.583
Water.

40:31.458 --> 40:35.375
How could someone
who hasn't eaten in so long

40:35.375 --> 40:37.750
still weigh so much?

40:37.750 --> 40:39.375
[both grunting]

40:41.000 --> 40:42.458
Quick sticks!

40:43.166 --> 40:44.291
[grunts]

40:45.041 --> 40:46.416
Please, oh, please, oh, please.

40:47.166 --> 40:48.291
Hurry, Poppy!

40:53.708 --> 40:57.583
[grunting]

41:04.625 --> 41:05.708
Come on!

41:06.458 --> 41:07.791
[water splashing]

41:14.000 --> 41:15.000
[grunts]

41:15.541 --> 41:16.583
I got it.

41:16.583 --> 41:18.458
[bell dinging]

41:26.291 --> 41:27.541
[Nori] Come on.

41:27.541 --> 41:29.750
[pealing rapidly]

41:31.166 --> 41:32.333
Come on.

41:33.916 --> 41:35.416
You're going to be all right.

41:35.416 --> 41:37.250
[bell continues dinging]

41:37.250 --> 41:39.125
[coughing]

41:39.750 --> 41:42.083
[Nori sighs] Great goats, you're alive.

41:42.083 --> 41:44.916
For a moment there,
I thought we'd lost... we'd lost you.

41:47.416 --> 41:49.041
[water splashing]

41:51.000 --> 41:53.583
We're none of us,
going to lose each other.

41:53.583 --> 41:55.666
[Nori and Poppy panting]

41:57.875 --> 42:00.208
I'd be crying 'cept my eyes are too dry.

42:01.250 --> 42:02.083
[gasps]

42:02.083 --> 42:03.625
[all chuckling]

42:08.958 --> 42:09.875
Oh...

42:09.875 --> 42:11.833
[panting]

42:29.833 --> 42:30.875
What is it?

42:32.625 --> 42:34.000
You don't think...

42:34.000 --> 42:39.041
It is not dissimilar
from the staff I saw in my dream.

42:39.041 --> 42:41.166
Um, Nori...

42:41.166 --> 42:42.750
[horse whinnies]

42:42.750 --> 42:45.083
[sinister music playing]

42:51.041 --> 42:52.500
[horse whinnies]

42:54.125 --> 42:55.583
[Gaudrim breathing heavily]

43:05.291 --> 43:07.708
Oh, we were just having a drink of water.

43:10.583 --> 43:11.791
[Kilta, in RhÃ»nnic] PÃ¤ngul niganvil!

43:11.791 --> 43:13.291
[Kilta grunts]

43:13.791 --> 43:15.333
- [arrows whistling]
- [all exclaiming]

43:15.333 --> 43:16.833
[Gaudrim grunts]

43:17.458 --> 43:19.583
[both breathing heavily]

43:20.458 --> 43:21.583
[Gaudrim grunts]

43:23.583 --> 43:24.916
[in English] What are you doin'?

43:24.916 --> 43:25.875
Nori, get down!

43:28.833 --> 43:30.000
[speaking Quenya]

43:32.958 --> 43:34.375
[rumbling]

43:34.375 --> 43:35.333
[Kilta and Gaudrim grunt]

43:35.958 --> 43:37.500
[Kilta exclaims in RhÃ»nnic]

43:38.625 --> 43:39.750
[exhales]

43:41.000 --> 43:42.833
[horses whinny]

43:46.583 --> 43:48.291
[speaking Quenya]

43:56.041 --> 43:58.416
[Kilta and Gaudrim scream]

44:05.041 --> 44:07.166
- [Stranger yells]
- [Nori and Poppy coughing and yelping]

44:09.916 --> 44:11.250
[Stranger grunting]

44:13.000 --> 44:14.458
[bell clanging]

44:18.541 --> 44:20.500
[Poppy in English]
Stop! Stop! Make it stop!

44:23.791 --> 44:25.625
[Nori yelping]

44:26.458 --> 44:28.291
Why isn't he stopping it?

44:28.916 --> 44:30.291
He can't!

44:36.666 --> 44:39.166
[Nori and Poppy scream]

44:39.166 --> 44:40.416
[Nori] Help us!

44:42.083 --> 44:43.500
[Stranger] Nori!

44:45.958 --> 44:47.708
I'm coming!

44:48.250 --> 44:49.291
[grunts]

44:51.666 --> 44:53.041
[Nori and Poppy screaming]

44:53.041 --> 44:57.458
Hold on! Hold on!

44:59.291 --> 45:01.250
[Nori and Poppy screaming]

45:05.000 --> 45:06.208
[Stranger yells] Nori!

45:07.166 --> 45:08.750
Nori!

45:20.666 --> 45:22.083
It's gone.

45:24.833 --> 45:26.083
Has it?

45:39.875 --> 45:41.750
I have called it <i>ithildin.</i>

45:41.750 --> 45:44.375
Made from our last sliver of <i>mithril.</i>

45:44.375 --> 45:48.208
Out of the moonlight,
it is all but invisible.

45:49.125 --> 45:50.125
It is.

45:51.916 --> 45:53.125
Quite invisible.

45:59.750 --> 46:02.375
Our visitor, is he still...

46:03.791 --> 46:05.958
The night is cold, my lord.

46:06.833 --> 46:09.000
Shall I bring him a shawl?

46:11.458 --> 46:13.250
[ominous music playing]

46:27.166 --> 46:28.708
[rain pattering]

46:44.208 --> 46:47.208
[thunder rumbles]

47:07.791 --> 47:10.875
Whatever the reason
for your presence here,

47:12.875 --> 47:16.250
if you do not leave willingly,
you shall be removed by force.

47:18.208 --> 47:19.833
I can treat with you no longer.

47:23.333 --> 47:24.750
She said you'd say that.

47:29.375 --> 47:32.583
Galadriel? You have spoken with her?

47:34.083 --> 47:35.125
Well, haven't you?

47:35.666 --> 47:36.583
I have not.

47:37.750 --> 47:39.500
Not since she left for Lindon.

47:40.416 --> 47:42.500
Then you know nothing of what's happened?

47:43.875 --> 47:45.166
Nothing of the Rings?

47:48.375 --> 47:49.750
What of the Rings?

47:51.833 --> 47:52.833
Have they worked?

47:55.208 --> 47:56.750
You'd do better to ask her.

47:57.250 --> 47:58.416
[Celebrimbor] She's not here.

47:59.541 --> 48:00.416
You are.

48:00.416 --> 48:02.041
What about the High King?

48:02.041 --> 48:04.916
Surely he wouldn't neglect
to send word of--

48:06.958 --> 48:08.250
Oh, I see.

48:10.166 --> 48:13.375
It's the oldest tale there is, isn't it?

48:16.375 --> 48:19.666
The true creators toil
till their knuckles bleed

48:20.833 --> 48:24.750
and then they come along,
take whatever profits them most,

48:25.708 --> 48:27.458
and forget all about us.

48:30.666 --> 48:32.416
I applaud your patience.

48:34.541 --> 48:36.083
Where are you going?

48:36.083 --> 48:38.500
There's no cause
to stay where I'm not wanted.

48:40.791 --> 48:41.791
Wait.

48:55.458 --> 48:57.583
Halbrand. Please. Tell me.

48:58.916 --> 49:02.833
The Rings. Did they work?

49:11.708 --> 49:13.291
They worked wonders.

49:17.041 --> 49:18.625
Then, the Elves--

49:18.625 --> 49:19.708
[Halbrand] Yes.

49:24.708 --> 49:26.916
And, uh, Lindon?

49:26.916 --> 49:28.000
Yes.

49:30.041 --> 49:30.958
[sniffles]

49:32.958 --> 49:33.875
[whimpers]

49:35.041 --> 49:36.958
- Are you weeping?
- No.

49:38.875 --> 49:40.333
[laughs]

49:42.583 --> 49:44.208
I am reveling.

49:46.125 --> 49:49.083
You have not the slightest inkling...

49:51.791 --> 49:53.291
how this feels.

49:53.291 --> 49:55.708
After all this time,
after so many centuries,

49:55.708 --> 49:58.375
to finally create something.

50:01.166 --> 50:02.875
I'm going to open a First Age bottle.

50:05.166 --> 50:08.291
I have been saving it.

50:13.875 --> 50:15.125
Celebrimbor...

50:21.625 --> 50:22.958
Are you my friend?

50:24.916 --> 50:26.250
Yes, of course.

50:27.791 --> 50:28.833
Why?

50:28.833 --> 50:30.791
Because there is no place for half-truths

50:30.791 --> 50:33.791
between those who've worked
so close as you and I.

50:34.791 --> 50:35.625
Oh...

50:37.208 --> 50:40.958
And yet there is much you do not know.

50:42.500 --> 50:43.666
Much I want to tell you.

50:45.458 --> 50:46.458
Only...

50:49.291 --> 50:50.750
You're afraid.

50:52.458 --> 50:55.333
You see? I've never been able
to hide anything from you.

50:56.958 --> 50:58.125
Well...

51:02.750 --> 51:04.083
Be at ease.

51:07.333 --> 51:10.583
Whatever it is you wish to say to me,
I shall receive it with an open heart.

51:13.166 --> 51:15.375
I did not come here
to toast the Elven Rings.

51:17.291 --> 51:21.041
But to plead with you
to make Rings for Men.

51:22.500 --> 51:23.833
Rings for Men?

51:24.791 --> 51:26.833
- [Halbrand] You saved the Elves.
- Uh...

51:28.166 --> 51:29.291
Elves are not Men.

51:30.916 --> 51:31.875
Men are covetous.

51:34.208 --> 51:36.958
The risks of,
of corruption are far greater.

51:37.625 --> 51:39.291
Even if I did wish to forge more Rings,

51:39.291 --> 51:41.208
the Dwarves would never
provide the <i>mithril.</i>

51:41.208 --> 51:43.916
I think you'll find the Dwarves
facing a dilemma all their own.

51:43.916 --> 51:46.125
What dilemma?
What are you talking about, Halbrand?

51:48.625 --> 51:50.625
My name is not Halbrand.

51:52.375 --> 51:53.291
What?

51:53.291 --> 51:56.000
When Galadriel discovered the truth,
she cast me out.

51:57.250 --> 51:59.416
And I dare not risk the same
happening with you.

51:59.416 --> 52:03.166
[thunder rumbling]

52:03.166 --> 52:06.166
I... I take it then you are not a King.

52:06.958 --> 52:09.500
No. Not a King.

52:10.708 --> 52:12.500
Not a Southlander.

52:13.166 --> 52:16.041
Not even a... mortal.

52:17.833 --> 52:18.708
[scoffs]

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
What are you?

52:22.458 --> 52:28.083
There are forces in this world
beyond evil, Celebrimbor.

52:28.708 --> 52:32.375
And sometimes, they send aid,

52:33.500 --> 52:34.791
in the form of an envoy.

52:34.791 --> 52:40.541
A... A messenger, sent to bring guidance
to the ears of the wise.

52:42.041 --> 52:42.875
Uh...

52:44.500 --> 52:46.708
What sort of guidance?

52:48.083 --> 52:50.333
Mordor's rise was but the beginning.

52:50.333 --> 52:53.750
At this very moment, all Middle-earth
balances on the brink of the abyss.

52:54.458 --> 52:56.791
Soon, every realm will fall.

52:58.208 --> 53:02.500
Not just Elves, but Dwarves. And Men.

53:04.541 --> 53:06.291
The darkness is growing stronger.

53:07.333 --> 53:10.583
And the Rings of Power are our last hope
of restoring the light.

53:13.791 --> 53:15.250
You and I have work to do.

53:20.583 --> 53:21.541
[chuckles softly]

53:21.541 --> 53:24.375
You cannot expect me to believe

53:24.375 --> 53:28.000
that you are a, a messenger
from the Valar sent to--

53:28.000 --> 53:31.375
[thunder rumbling]

53:38.708 --> 53:39.916
Halbrand?

53:42.250 --> 53:43.250
Halbrand!

53:51.500 --> 53:52.375
[shudders]

53:53.708 --> 53:55.958
[sinister music playing]

54:01.750 --> 54:02.916
Halbrand!

54:14.916 --> 54:16.708
[breath trembling]

54:31.208 --> 54:34.583
[Halbrand] <i>I have walked through the dust
and the deserts of far-away lands,</i>

54:37.250 --> 54:43.041
<i>in search of an artist possessing
the craft to save all Middle-earth.</i>

54:45.541 --> 54:47.958
<i>A storm is coming, Celebrimbor.</i>

54:50.250 --> 54:53.375
<i>I can bring you the knowledge
none other possesses.</i>

54:53.958 --> 54:57.166
<i>I can unlock your grandest abilities.</i>

54:57.958 --> 55:00.125
<i>And when our work is complete,</i>

55:00.125 --> 55:05.458
<i>never again will the world overlook you
as the mere scion of FÃ«anor</i>

55:06.041 --> 55:08.333
but forevermore revere you...

55:14.291 --> 55:16.708
The Lord of the Rings.

55:41.958 --> 55:43.666
You need not bow to me.

55:44.416 --> 55:46.500
But I have beheld your natural form.

55:49.833 --> 55:51.000
Rise.

55:53.708 --> 55:55.416
Our work begins now.

55:56.666 --> 55:58.500
What am I to call you?

55:58.500 --> 55:59.666
[Halbrand] I am your partner.

56:02.125 --> 56:04.958
No more, no less.

56:07.000 --> 56:08.875
A sharer of gifts.

56:11.375 --> 56:12.916
Annatar.

56:14.708 --> 56:16.166
Annatar.

56:19.958 --> 56:21.666
Lord of Gifts.

56:38.500 --> 56:39.583
You summoned me.

56:40.416 --> 56:42.125
You have new orders, Commander.

56:42.916 --> 56:47.541
You depart for Eregion at first light,
with five of our bravest Elves.

56:48.708 --> 56:49.708
I...

56:51.708 --> 56:54.541
Thank you for reconsidering.

56:54.541 --> 56:56.708
It is not I, you ought to thank.

56:59.833 --> 57:00.916
[Galadriel] Elrond.

57:05.250 --> 57:08.458
I am very grateful you have decided
to join my company.

57:11.208 --> 57:13.708
I'm afraid you misunderstand, Galadriel.

57:14.875 --> 57:17.791
Elrond's task is not to join your company.

57:18.541 --> 57:20.208
But to lead it.

57:27.625 --> 57:29.958

57:48.416 --> 57:49.625
[knock at door]

57:58.458 --> 58:00.958
What is it? Is it Elrond?

58:01.916 --> 58:04.708
It's some sort of invitation...

58:06.250 --> 58:08.916
from Lord Celebrimbor.

58:08.916 --> 58:12.041
He wants the Dwarves to come to Eregion.

58:15.375 --> 58:18.041
