20:30.520 --> 20:32.981

20:32.981 --> 20:34.775

20:39.446 --> 20:41.281

20:42.574 --> 20:44.368

20:44.368 --> 20:46.787

21:02.844 --> 21:05.013

21:11.019 --> 21:14.856

21:33.083 --> 21:36.336
However, we felt like we needed
to triple that amount.

21:36.336 --> 21:40.173
<i>So, everything in addition
was visual effects.</i>

21:40.507 --> 21:42.718
When we need to make

21:42.718 --> 21:44.636

21:44.636 --> 21:47.055
<i>from the actual performers themselves,</i>

<i>so an animator doesn't have to

21:49.474 --> 21:54.813
Mocap is a methodology

21:54.813 --> 21:56.398

22:09.202 --> 22:11.580

<i>We would glue all the mushrooms

22:52.037 --> 22:54.831
<i>and then the suits would
go over to Sage and her team,</i>

22:54.831 --> 22:56.291
and they would cut the costumes

22:56.291 --> 22:58.919

22:58.919 --> 23:01.004

the skin</i>

23:02.756 --> 23:04.132
<i>and the flesh broke down.</i>

23:04.132 --> 23:07.594
Each clicker is designed individually.

23:07.594 --> 23:08.970
And the costume
had to be durable enough

23:08.970 --> 23:14.017
<i>to go through all of the crazy
contortionist sort of moves</i>

23:14.017 --> 23:16.269

rotting and molding</i>

23:21.108 --> 23:22.275
<i>for months or years.</i>

23:22.275 --> 23:24.111
<i>And so, when you see
the whole thing together,</i>

23:24.111 --> 23:25.153

23:25.529 --> 23:28.406

<i>and it helps us
have better understanding</i>

29:30.643 --> 29:33.688
<i>for someone who doesn't look
or act like us,</i>

29:33.688 --> 29:35.440
<i>who might come from
a different culture,</i>

29:35.440 --> 29:38.943
<i>and I think that we'll be able
to jump over some of these</i>

29:38.943 --> 29:40.904
<i>skyscraper-high hurdles</i>

29:40.904 --> 29:43.573
that we have in the things
that divide us.

29:43.990 --> 29:46.826
<i>And that will never end.</i>

29:46.826 --> 29:50.872
That right there is the crux
of <i>The Last of Us.</i>

29:51.998 --> 29:54.918
PASCAL: <i>One of the most
exciting experiences of my life</i>

29:54.918 --> 29:57.128
<i>was getting this job.</i>

29:57.128 --> 30:01.549
To come back to HBO,
which basically raised me,

30:01.549 --> 30:06.221
<i>to meet Craig, to meet Bella,
all of our different actors,</i>

30:06.221 --> 30:09.474
<i>there was something of where
I knew this was going to be</i>

30:09.474 --> 30:14.562
the hardest and the best
experience of my life.

30:14.562 --> 30:16.147
<i>And weirdly,
there was something</i>

30:16.147 --> 30:19.817
<i>that I knew was special
and terrifying.</i>

30:19.817 --> 30:22.111
And it all came true.
(LAUGHS)

30:23.905 --> 30:28.368
On the first day,
I set a fairly reasonable goal

30:28.368 --> 30:30.828
to make the best
television show ever.

30:30.828 --> 30:32.413
That was our reasonable goal.

30:33.164 --> 30:37.502
I just want to say thank you.
I love you guys. Thank you.

30:37.835 --> 30:40.296

30:40.547 --> 30:45.134

31:05.572 --> 31:07.490
And that's the end
of this story.
