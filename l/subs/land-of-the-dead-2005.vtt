01:01.835 --> 01:03.427
... dead people...

01:03.503 --> 01:05.528
... the recently departed...

01:05.605 --> 01:08.129
Unburied human corpses
are returning to life...

01:08.207 --> 01:09.572
and feeding on the living.

01:09.641 --> 01:10.699
Stay inside.

01:10.776 --> 01:12.437
Do not try
to leave your homes.

01:12.511 --> 01:14.843
They seem to survive
by eating human flesh.

01:14.913 --> 01:17.108
Everyone who dies
will become one of them.

01:17.182 --> 01:19.308
If you are bitten, you will just become
one of them...

01:19.384 --> 01:21.045
that much sooner.

01:22.153 --> 01:25.452
They're not your neighbors
and friends, not anymore.

01:25.523 --> 01:27.013
My wife had a heart attack.

01:27.091 --> 01:29.058
Got up and came after me
like a banshee from hell.

01:29.126 --> 01:30.923
I put a curling iron
through her head.

01:30.994 --> 01:33.087
... - the head...
-  ... the brain...

01:33.163 --> 01:35.154
They must be destroyed
as quickly as possible.

01:35.232 --> 01:37.291
There's no time
for funeral arrangements.

01:37.367 --> 01:38.994
There's no time
to dig up holes...

01:39.069 --> 01:40.695
so you can drop these things
in the ground.

01:40.770 --> 01:41.964
As long as we're alive...

01:42.037 --> 01:43.470
they ain't never gonna
run out of food.

01:43.539 --> 01:46.804
The day they do, it'll mean only one thing:
We're all dead.

01:46.976 --> 01:49.877
This is not only a local
or a regional phenomenon.

01:49.945 --> 01:51.707
Cities are under siege.

01:55.750 --> 01:58.241
If these creatures ever
develop the power to think...

01:58.319 --> 01:59.343
to reason...

01:59.421 --> 02:01.753
even in the most
primitive way...

02:01.823 --> 02:03.813
People are said
to be establishing...

02:03.891 --> 02:05.051
outposts in big cities...

02:05.125 --> 02:08.925
and raiding small rural towns
for supplies, like outlaws.

03:29.236 --> 03:30.863
They're trying to be us.

03:30.937 --> 03:32.768
No, they used to be us.

03:32.839 --> 03:34.829
Learning how to be us again.

03:35.007 --> 03:39.273
No way. Some germ or some devil
got those things up and walking...

03:39.345 --> 03:42.246
but there's a big difference
between us and them.

03:43.215 --> 03:44.705
They're dead.

03:47.886 --> 03:49.911
It's like they're pretending
to be alive.

03:49.988 --> 03:53.321
Isn't that what we're doing,
pretending to be alive?

03:57.561 --> 03:59.426
He knows we're here.

04:03.400 --> 04:04.833
Christ.

04:05.202 --> 04:07.533
It's like he's
talking to them.

04:11.173 --> 04:12.470
Let's go.

04:34.194 --> 04:37.357
A whole lot of trash this
week. That's life, bro.

04:37.431 --> 04:40.264
Whole lot of trash, trick
is not to get in with it.

04:58.584 --> 05:01.678
You any good with that, kid? Because
I'm real good with mine.

05:01.753 --> 05:04.846
Put it away, Charlie.
Don't be so jumpy, kid.

05:05.856 --> 05:07.050
What are you doing?

05:07.124 --> 05:09.888
Watching your back. I don't
like it when you go off without me.

05:09.961 --> 05:12.191
I told you to get things
ready. I got things ready...

05:12.263 --> 05:14.595
then I come
to watch your back.

05:15.565 --> 05:17.556
Christ! This is like
a bad dream.

05:17.634 --> 05:18.931
I have bad dreams.

05:19.202 --> 05:21.932
Hell, yes. Just look at me, you
can tell I have terrible dreams.

05:22.005 --> 05:23.734
Riley, what's your 20?

05:23.807 --> 05:24.865
We checked out the town.

05:24.941 --> 05:27.636
There's plenty of supplies, but
a lot of walkers. Where's Cholo?

05:27.710 --> 05:29.575
He dumped the trash,
and he's on his way back.

05:29.645 --> 05:30.942
We're ready to go in.
Okay.

05:31.013 --> 05:33.140
Put some flowers
in the graveyard.

05:37.119 --> 05:39.882
"Flowers in the graveyard."
Why do you call them that, Riley?

05:39.954 --> 05:41.012
I don't get it.

05:41.089 --> 05:44.115
These here flowers ain't
the kind you lay down on the ground.

05:44.192 --> 05:47.389
These here are sky flowers,
way up in heaven.

05:47.462 --> 05:50.430
That's why I love you, Charlie.
Because you still believe in heaven.

05:50.497 --> 05:51.896
Lord, yeah.

05:54.234 --> 05:55.895
I mean, look.

06:27.331 --> 06:28.798
Nice driving.

06:28.899 --> 06:31.925
Riley, looks like God's left
the phone off the hook, huh, baby?

06:33.003 --> 06:35.266
Go get my ride.
Get yours, too.

06:35.338 --> 06:36.930
What's the matter?
You look like shit, man.

06:37.006 --> 06:38.234
Didn't I tell you
not to bang chicks...

06:38.307 --> 06:40.707
with problems worse than you?
When are going to listen me?

06:40.777 --> 06:44.042
You done?
I'm never done, baby. Why?

06:44.881 --> 06:46.347
The town's full of walkers.

06:46.415 --> 06:47.973
Yeah, but every town
is full of walkers.

06:48.050 --> 06:50.917
No, these guys are not just walking.
It's like they're communicating.

06:50.986 --> 06:53.250
They're thinking, and
there's something going on.

06:53.321 --> 06:55.255
But they're dumb, Riley.

06:56.558 --> 06:58.889
Well, hell. Dead folks
is near as dumb as me.

06:58.959 --> 07:00.927
You learned to make yourself
useful, didn't you?

07:00.995 --> 07:02.326
Yeah.
That's what they're doing.

07:02.396 --> 07:03.488
Make yourself useful.

07:03.564 --> 07:05.691
You don't got one
redeeming defect, do you, son, huh?

07:05.766 --> 07:08.791
I got this! I got this! You
got that? You got that, too.

07:08.935 --> 07:12.336
Come on. Let's get to work before
I forget what it is I do for a living.

07:12.405 --> 07:14.134
Cholo, I'm talking to you.

07:16.076 --> 07:17.976
All right, what?
Things are changing.

07:18.044 --> 07:20.671
Just be careful.
We go in, we do our job...

07:20.746 --> 07:23.044
and we get the fuck
out of there. Everyone alive.

07:23.115 --> 07:25.982
Now, you take command of this unit,
you can run it any way you like.

07:26.051 --> 07:29.612
But tonight, it's my last night
out. I don't want any fuck-ups.

07:30.389 --> 07:31.878
So, that's what it's about?

07:31.956 --> 07:34.424
You're not going to dump these
recycled delinquents on me.

07:34.492 --> 07:36.153
I don't want to take command.

07:36.227 --> 07:39.321
Because you know what? Tonight's
my last night, too, baby.

07:39.964 --> 07:42.125
Hey, you. Come here,
you little nose-picker.

07:42.200 --> 07:44.224
You been with Riley all day
painting the town beige?

07:44.301 --> 07:46.201
I'm gonna show you
how it's done. Come on.

07:46.636 --> 07:49.469
What'd he do,
win the lottery or something?

07:51.141 --> 07:52.506
Something.

07:54.977 --> 07:57.138
How come you guys
always go out at night?

07:57.213 --> 07:58.737
Wouldn't it be safer
in the daytime?

08:00.116 --> 08:03.347
Fireworks, kid. Stenches
can't keep their eyes off them.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.244
Come on!

08:34.746 --> 08:36.270
Yeah!

08:59.470 --> 09:00.664
That sucker's mine, baby.

09:03.139 --> 09:04.401
I got that one.

09:53.352 --> 09:57.220
Number 1, how's the food?
Mostly canned stuff.

09:57.489 --> 09:59.615
I'd stay away from the fish.

10:02.961 --> 10:04.553
Number 2,
what's your location?

10:04.629 --> 10:05.687
Drugstore.

10:05.763 --> 10:07.492
Need an aspirin?
I got a million of them.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.658
Antibiotics.
We need antibiotics.

10:13.170 --> 10:17.402
They're gone.
The sky flowers, they're gone.

10:18.342 --> 10:20.503
That's not good, is it?
No, it's not good.

10:39.027 --> 10:41.621
Sorry, Riley,
I should have seen that thing.

10:41.730 --> 10:43.857
Nice shooting.
That's good shooting, Charlie.

10:43.964 --> 10:45.454
No such thing
as nice shooting.

10:45.566 --> 10:47.124
Pretty Boy,
what the fuck is going on?

10:47.201 --> 10:49.362
Fireworks are jammed.
We're getting on it.

10:49.436 --> 10:50.960
Shut her down!

10:51.872 --> 10:53.100
Everyone, out of town.

10:53.540 --> 10:55.734
Let's move! Go! Drive!

10:55.842 --> 10:57.173
Go!

11:03.216 --> 11:04.240
Two minutes!

11:04.317 --> 11:06.182
Pretty Boy,
lay down some cover.

11:06.252 --> 11:08.378
Get on the guns!

11:30.607 --> 11:33.770
I thought this was going to be a
battle. It's a fucking massacre.

11:52.126 --> 11:55.254
Cholo, we got a problem.
Fireworks are down.

11:55.363 --> 11:58.526
It's nice and peaceful,
ain't it? Cholo, where are you?

11:58.866 --> 12:01.357
I'm just getting some
supplies, some essential supplies...

12:01.436 --> 12:03.426
just like my job
description entails.

12:03.503 --> 12:05.767
Nothing in there but booze.
Booze ain't essential.

12:05.872 --> 12:08.705
A jug of good Kentucky
goes for $1,500 back in town.

12:08.775 --> 12:11.073
You've got to
get out of there. Cholo?

12:12.579 --> 12:14.308
God damn it!

12:37.368 --> 12:39.529
All right, Foxy,
shop till you drop, baby.

12:41.438 --> 12:42.462
You know it, brother.

12:42.539 --> 12:44.530
Yeah, 'cause
getting them stinking drunk...

12:44.608 --> 12:46.667
is the only way
you're gonna get laid.

12:48.345 --> 12:51.245
When's the last
time you got laid? I forget.

12:51.314 --> 12:53.839
Fox, I don't care about love.
All I care about is money.

12:53.916 --> 12:54.974
That's all I want, baby.

12:55.651 --> 12:56.811
Yes.

12:58.888 --> 13:00.184
Foxy!

13:02.891 --> 13:05.587
I can't
get a shot. Cholo, hold on.

13:10.232 --> 13:12.927
I got him. Cholo, I got him!

13:27.047 --> 13:30.141
Bro, do me a favor, will you?

13:30.817 --> 13:33.217
Next time, just let me
take the fucking shot.

13:33.353 --> 13:36.412
Fucking cowboy.
Stop being a pussy, man.

13:38.323 --> 13:39.881
Yeah, I got what I need.

13:46.764 --> 13:48.664
A little something extra, too.

13:52.403 --> 13:53.700
Nice.

13:56.174 --> 13:57.765
Here, kid, pick that up.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.501
I'm bit.
Yeah, you're bit.

14:34.575 --> 14:36.839
Not gonna leave you here.
Gonna get you out of here, okay?

14:36.910 --> 14:39.936
No. I will not become
one of those things.

14:40.013 --> 14:42.037
Riley, step aside.

14:42.148 --> 14:44.708
No, you put that thing away.
Riley, come on. Step aside.

14:44.784 --> 14:46.911
I said put it away.

15:13.611 --> 15:17.171
This is Riley. Cease fire.
Repeat, cease fire.

15:17.280 --> 15:19.407
Let's pack it up.
We're going to call it a night.

17:30.836 --> 17:32.803
Shit happens, right?

17:32.870 --> 17:34.895
Only if you let it, Charlie.

17:41.212 --> 17:43.509
Life goes on
at Fiddler's Green...

17:43.580 --> 17:46.640
in the heart of one of America's
oldest and greatest cities.

17:46.950 --> 17:49.214
Bordered on three sides
by mighty rivers...

17:49.286 --> 17:52.687
Fiddler's Green offers luxury living
in the grand old style.

17:53.223 --> 17:55.918
Dine at one of
six fine restaurants.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.783
Look for that perfect gift in our fully-stocked
shopping mall.

17:58.894 --> 18:01.089
Man, they sure did
used to make it sound nice.

18:01.730 --> 18:02.890
Still sounds nice to me.

18:02.965 --> 18:06.229
There is a difference between
our place and other places.

18:06.301 --> 18:08.064
If you can appreciate
that difference...

18:08.136 --> 18:09.967
You're not
going to be around no more?

18:10.038 --> 18:13.667
You little bitch, you can come up
and party with me any time you want.

18:16.044 --> 18:17.510
I hate going under the river.

18:18.745 --> 18:19.769
Cholo.

18:19.846 --> 18:22.041
Shit. Let's
get out of here, Foxy.

18:22.115 --> 18:23.639
Yeah, man. Back off, Riley.

18:23.717 --> 18:25.776
Just back the fuck off
'cause I am not in the mood.

18:25.852 --> 18:28.411
You think that kid was in the
mood? Look, he knew the risk, man.

18:28.487 --> 18:31.012
He took the job like we all
took the job knowing the risk.

18:31.090 --> 18:33.115
Exactly, the job. You know
what the job is, Cholo?

18:33.192 --> 18:35.183
It's to bring things in
that people need.

18:35.261 --> 18:38.424
Not to make a few extra bucks
selling liquor on the street.

18:38.497 --> 18:39.861
What, you're talking
about this?

18:39.931 --> 18:41.956
This is for me and my
new friends, to celebrate.

18:42.033 --> 18:43.898
That's what that's for.

18:43.968 --> 18:46.334
A kid died out there
on the street tonight...

18:46.404 --> 18:48.531
so that you can
fucking celebrate.

18:49.374 --> 18:53.207
Riley, you know what you remind
me of? You remind me of my old man.

18:54.178 --> 18:56.976
A nice guy. I loved him and
all that but he was a dumbass.

18:57.047 --> 18:59.242
Never went for anything,
so he never had anything.

18:59.316 --> 19:02.978
What do you got, Riley? Nothing.
I'm going to have my own place, man.

19:03.052 --> 19:04.747
My own goddamn place.

19:05.755 --> 19:07.746
You're dreaming, Cholo.
They won't let you in there.

19:07.824 --> 19:10.054
They wouldn't let me in there.
We're the wrong kind.

19:10.126 --> 19:11.787
Yeah, well, we'll see.

19:12.395 --> 19:13.884
Isn't it time?

19:13.995 --> 19:17.123
Isn't it your time?
For Fiddler's Green?

19:32.313 --> 19:33.905
DeMora, supplies unit.

19:34.215 --> 19:37.513
What's in them boxes?
Essential supplies.

19:38.752 --> 19:40.276
For Kaufman.

19:45.658 --> 19:47.648
Mark your calendars.

19:47.726 --> 19:49.318
Mr. Kaufman
cordially invites...

19:49.395 --> 19:51.386
residents of the Green
to a masked ball...

19:51.463 --> 19:53.055
on the eve of Allhallows.

19:53.132 --> 19:55.930
It is strictly forbidden
to come as you are.

19:56.001 --> 19:57.866
It's expensive. Look at that.

19:57.936 --> 19:58.925
You like it?

20:00.371 --> 20:01.360
I could tell.

20:17.053 --> 20:19.578
Can I ask you to stop, sir?

20:19.656 --> 20:20.918
Quitting time, Deke.

20:20.991 --> 20:22.514
You're going to need this
to get back in.

20:22.591 --> 20:25.321
When I said quitting time,
I meant quitting time.

20:26.929 --> 20:28.226
Hey, baby.

20:30.599 --> 20:33.396
"The only way to the Father,
is through me," sayeth the Lord.

20:33.468 --> 20:35.368
So, Riley, you
want to go get a drink?

20:35.437 --> 20:38.736
Just look at me. You can
tell I could use a drink.

20:39.908 --> 20:42.468
You know, Charlie,
why don't you go ahead?

20:42.544 --> 20:44.807
I'll catch up.
Where are you going?

20:46.647 --> 20:48.979
I got to see a man
about a car.

20:51.485 --> 20:52.747
A car?

21:06.165 --> 21:08.394
All right.
Here's the deal.

21:08.733 --> 21:12.601
Rivers protect us on two sides.
Bridges are all blocked up.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.805
The only overland access
is here, called the "Throat."

21:15.874 --> 21:17.341
And these fences
go all the way across?

21:17.409 --> 21:19.376
Half a mile, both ways.

21:21.111 --> 21:23.238
Stench. High noon.
Shit.

21:26.517 --> 21:28.747
They don't
come around here much anymore.

21:28.819 --> 21:31.412
It's like they've learned
they can't get in.

21:33.823 --> 21:35.882
Take his fucking face off.

21:44.099 --> 21:46.624
How long are you going
to let Kaufman push you around?

21:46.702 --> 21:49.227
You like shining his shoes,
pressing his pants?

21:49.304 --> 21:52.704
He didn't build that place.
He just took it over.

21:52.773 --> 21:56.072
Kept the best for himself, and
left us with a slum to live in.

21:56.143 --> 21:59.271
But if there's enough of us,
if all of you would join up...

21:59.514 --> 22:01.778
we could make this
a fit place to live in.

22:01.849 --> 22:04.180
Dad, look who's here.

22:04.818 --> 22:08.515
Riley Denbo!
I used to work with him.

22:08.722 --> 22:11.384
Bringing in toothpicks for the
bastards to pick at their gums.

22:11.458 --> 22:14.325
And food and other stuff,
for all of us.

22:15.094 --> 22:17.221
Come in with us, Riley.
Both of you.

22:17.496 --> 22:19.760
Together we'd be unstoppable.

22:19.832 --> 22:21.925
No one's unstoppable,
Mulligan.

22:22.001 --> 22:24.469
You're worried about being
locked out. Now, you see that?

22:24.537 --> 22:26.697
I can't help but think
we're all locked in.

22:26.771 --> 22:29.399
I'm looking for
a world where there's no fences.

22:29.841 --> 22:33.709
Here. Antibiotics for your boy. Thanks.

22:39.149 --> 22:41.447
You all right, Son?
I'm fine, Dad.

22:53.763 --> 22:55.697
Hey, easy, easy, Knipp! Easy.

22:55.865 --> 23:00.097
Mr. DeMora. Mr. Kaufman
isn't home. And I heard...

23:02.404 --> 23:03.530
That.

23:04.239 --> 23:06.639
I called Security.
They should be here.

23:06.708 --> 23:08.198
Yeah, I got it.

23:29.062 --> 23:30.051
Where are you?

23:42.574 --> 23:43.768
Oh, shit.

23:54.619 --> 23:56.587
Oh, God, he killed himself.

23:56.754 --> 23:59.847
All right, lady, I need you to
down, okay? Try to keep it together.

23:59.956 --> 24:02.857
Who are you? Are you Security?
No, I'm not Security.

24:02.959 --> 24:04.950
Then, who the hell are you?

24:05.061 --> 24:08.257
I work for Kaufman. All right, lady,
I just need you to calm down, please.

24:08.330 --> 24:10.093
What are you doing with that?

24:10.165 --> 24:12.793
Lady, you know
what I have to do. I'm sorry.

24:12.868 --> 24:13.857
Dad!

24:14.136 --> 24:15.865
He's gonna turn, lady.

24:15.938 --> 24:17.371
No, he won't. Please.

24:17.439 --> 24:19.168
No, he's okay. Please,
we don't have a choice.

24:19.241 --> 24:21.333
Don't make this anymore
difficult than it has to be.

24:21.409 --> 24:22.899
He's gonna turn,
don't do this!

24:26.514 --> 24:29.108
What's happening?
Shut up.

24:38.659 --> 24:39.887
Hey, kid.

24:54.272 --> 24:56.467
What the hell's going on here?

25:05.749 --> 25:08.616
It's your problem.
Clean it up.

25:12.189 --> 25:13.918
Hey, lady, it's okay.

25:29.204 --> 25:31.365
What did you do to my car?
What car?

25:31.506 --> 25:34.304
The last car I drove out of
this town was three years ago.

25:34.376 --> 25:37.277
No, I bought a car.
It was right there yesterday.

25:37.345 --> 25:38.539
There were two guys
working on it.

25:38.613 --> 25:40.671
There was nobody here
this morning.

25:41.716 --> 25:43.047
Son of a bitch.

25:43.217 --> 25:45.481
What happened, Riley?
Did you get fucked?

25:45.553 --> 25:46.747
Come with me.

25:48.189 --> 25:49.554
You got fucked.

26:25.355 --> 26:27.983
Roach.
Hey, how's it going?

26:28.158 --> 26:29.955
I've been better.
Where's Chihuahua?

26:30.026 --> 26:31.550
Around the back.

26:33.530 --> 26:34.724
Come on!

26:34.798 --> 26:37.891
Lot of action in here today.
We've got a new kind of game.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.594
What are they betting on?
Black and red.

26:40.669 --> 26:43.001
Who wins the fight.

26:43.105 --> 26:44.572
Stenches don't fight.

26:44.640 --> 26:46.073
They do when there's food.

26:46.142 --> 26:47.733
What's on the menu,
cat or dog?

26:47.809 --> 26:50.300
I told you,
today it's something new.

26:51.012 --> 26:54.345
Who do you want, black
or red? $60 on black.

27:28.046 --> 27:30.037
What the fuck happened
to my car?

27:30.115 --> 27:31.639
They're fixing it up.

27:31.716 --> 27:34.616
No, I went to the garage.
There's nothing there.

27:34.685 --> 27:37.153
Your guys aren't there,
and my car is not there.

27:37.221 --> 27:41.317
This is not me. I do not do this
to you. I'm your friend.

27:41.392 --> 27:43.484
Well, be my friend
and get my fucking car back...

27:43.560 --> 27:46.688
or I'll have to carry you
out of here inside that fucking hat.

27:56.171 --> 27:58.571
This guy could
be trouble. Keep him busy.

28:00.475 --> 28:02.067
Give a drink.

28:04.446 --> 28:06.208
Let me have my gun.

28:15.489 --> 28:16.922
Supply run last night, huh?

28:16.991 --> 28:18.958
I heard you got some money.
Not interested.

28:19.025 --> 28:21.050
I'll show you how to
turn that money into more...

28:21.127 --> 28:22.321
I said I'm not interested.

28:37.376 --> 28:38.809
Jesus! Fuck!

29:08.037 --> 29:09.902
My suit.

29:10.706 --> 29:12.936
He ruined my fucking suit!

29:52.444 --> 29:53.536
Shit.

29:59.517 --> 30:01.041
I'm all right.

30:06.958 --> 30:09.290
Thank you.
Thank you.

30:14.130 --> 30:15.654
I've seen you around.

30:15.732 --> 30:18.792
I've seen you around, too,
working the streets.

30:21.471 --> 30:23.461
You were checking me out?

30:26.275 --> 30:27.970
What the hell happened here?

30:28.043 --> 30:31.035
Someone shot the little
fat man. I see that.

30:31.347 --> 30:32.405
You're under arrest.

30:40.588 --> 30:41.577
Hey.

30:42.190 --> 30:43.714
What?
Why you?

30:43.791 --> 30:47.590
Why'd the little fat man
throw you in there with them things?

30:48.562 --> 30:50.257
Wasn't the little man.

30:51.999 --> 30:53.489
It was the big man.

30:54.835 --> 30:56.131
Mr. K.

30:56.602 --> 30:59.230
He's got his fingers
in everything here.

30:59.372 --> 31:01.897
If you can drink it,
shoot it up...

31:02.108 --> 31:06.807
fuck it, gamble on it,
it belongs to him.

31:07.779 --> 31:09.838
Didn't answer the question.

31:10.882 --> 31:13.282
He asked you why.
I know what he asked me.

31:18.056 --> 31:22.253
They found out I was helping
out Mulligan and his people...

31:22.960 --> 31:25.758
tired of eating bones
while he's having a steak.

31:25.863 --> 31:28.661
Me, too,
but every place is the same.

31:28.999 --> 31:30.761
Places with people.

31:31.200 --> 31:33.498
I'm going to find a place
where there's no people.

31:33.569 --> 31:34.558
North.

31:34.871 --> 31:37.431
Canada.
If you get a way out...

31:38.674 --> 31:42.336
- I'm coming with you.
-  No, Riley likes to be alone.

31:42.511 --> 31:45.537
He might take me,
'cause he says...

31:45.647 --> 31:49.208
having me around is pretty
much the same as being alone.

31:50.185 --> 31:54.644
And 'cause I can make
myself useful, and I can shoot.

31:54.722 --> 31:58.214
I can shoot. I can be
pretty fucking useful.

31:59.260 --> 32:03.663
I had training. I was going to
join the army, help the Green...

32:03.898 --> 32:07.128
till somebody figured I'd
be a better hooker than a soldier.

32:07.200 --> 32:09.293
You know, I don't want to hear
your fucking story.

32:09.369 --> 32:13.203
Everyone's got a story,
and I am sick of hearing them.

32:14.007 --> 32:16.031
What's your story, Riley?

32:17.076 --> 32:18.304
I don't have one.

32:18.377 --> 32:22.245
Nothing bad ever happened to
me till everything changed.

32:24.016 --> 32:25.745
Everything changed
for all of us.

32:34.625 --> 32:35.922
Hey, Mulligan.

32:41.731 --> 32:44.996
What they going to do?
Kill him? Not right away.

32:45.735 --> 32:50.034
First they'll try to get him
to talk. About people like me.

34:15.617 --> 34:17.915
Mr. DeMora. Boss.

34:18.120 --> 34:20.417
How was Uniontown?
Dead.

34:21.422 --> 34:24.914
Death intrudes on us even here
in the city, I'm afraid.

34:25.159 --> 34:27.286
I heard abut what happened
with my neighbors.

34:27.360 --> 34:28.760
And I'm grateful
for your help.

34:28.829 --> 34:30.353
That's what I'm here for,
boss...

34:30.431 --> 34:32.398
to take care of any problems
you got.

34:32.465 --> 34:35.900
Look, I got you a little present,
a little souvenir from town.

34:42.574 --> 34:44.565
I know you're used to
better vintage than this...

34:44.643 --> 34:45.905
but it's the best we got.

34:45.978 --> 34:48.242
Little champers
to take the edge off things.

34:50.683 --> 34:52.081
There we go.

34:56.187 --> 34:59.520
This is very extravagant.
Yeah, well, I can afford it.

35:00.792 --> 35:02.953
With the $20,000 you owe me
from last night...

35:03.027 --> 35:05.086
and the money from all
the other nights together...

35:05.163 --> 35:07.096
I got enough for my own place.

35:07.497 --> 35:10.398
You mean here in the Green?
Sure, why not?

35:13.103 --> 35:15.037
I'm sorry, Mr. DeMora...

35:16.839 --> 35:19.171
but there's
a very long waiting list.

35:20.810 --> 35:22.573
How long?
Well...

35:23.012 --> 35:25.845
this is an extremely
desirable location.

35:26.449 --> 35:28.109
Space is very limited.

35:28.383 --> 35:29.816
You mean restricted,
don't you?

35:29.884 --> 35:31.511
I do have
a board of directors...

35:31.586 --> 35:33.781
and I have
a membership committee.

35:35.457 --> 35:40.120
They have to approve.
Don't do this to me. Don't.

35:41.128 --> 35:43.926
How long have I been working
for you? Three years?

35:43.998 --> 35:46.796
Taking out your garbage,
cleaning up after you...

35:47.067 --> 35:49.467
and then you're going to say
I'm not good enough?

35:49.536 --> 35:52.231
Let me tell you something,
you're going to let me in...

35:52.305 --> 35:53.966
because I know
what goes on around here.

35:54.040 --> 35:55.268
Do your
committee members know...

35:55.341 --> 35:57.275
what the fuck is going out
with the garbage?

35:58.344 --> 36:00.710
So, you're gonna let me in,
you hear me?

36:01.648 --> 36:04.411
Maybe we could talk about this when
you're a little less excited.

36:22.933 --> 36:25.492
I won't be needing
this man anymore.

36:49.223 --> 36:51.248
Take that, you scary zombie.

36:52.493 --> 36:53.926
... come back to God.

36:53.995 --> 36:55.724
Give up your lives of sin.

36:56.197 --> 36:59.359
Praise the Lord!
Father is the only way.

37:00.033 --> 37:02.001
Come back to Jesus.

37:03.837 --> 37:06.067
Fox, get the guys.
We're going out.

37:07.741 --> 37:11.437
Want me to call Riley? Forget
Riley. Just us. Come on.

37:14.246 --> 37:15.440
Thanks.

37:18.784 --> 37:21.479
Shit, man. You win. You
got him right in the brain.

37:21.553 --> 37:24.078
That's right.
Double or nothing.

37:27.892 --> 37:30.622
Brubaker, who'd you blow
to get this cushy job?

37:30.695 --> 37:32.992
Cholo, you
bum, how's it going?

37:33.163 --> 37:36.155
Where's Riley?
He's retired.

37:36.300 --> 37:38.359
We're taking the truck out.

37:39.136 --> 37:42.128
That's from yesterday.
What? You're shitting me.

37:42.206 --> 37:44.139
I'm gonna quit drinking, man.

37:46.843 --> 37:49.971
What the hell is that? Relax.
It's just target practice.

37:50.046 --> 37:52.139
Barrett, stop scratching
around back there.

37:52.215 --> 37:53.512
You're going to
fuck up my shot.

37:53.616 --> 37:56.812
I'm not doing nothing, man,
I'm just standing here.

38:11.832 --> 38:13.493
There's nothing there, man.

38:16.137 --> 38:18.104
So, what the hell is that,
screaming practice?

38:18.171 --> 38:19.798
Stenches!
They're all over the place.

38:24.844 --> 38:26.436
Let's make our move. Come on.

38:31.817 --> 38:33.444
All right, go.

38:39.458 --> 38:40.481
Their eyes.

38:44.595 --> 38:46.324
Mouse, take that.

38:46.531 --> 38:48.192
Cholo, should we send up
some sky flowers?

38:48.266 --> 38:49.290
It ain't our fight, Fox.

38:49.367 --> 38:51.494
The stenches want to get in,
let them in. Come on.

38:53.470 --> 38:55.404
Everybody, get busy.

39:03.579 --> 39:05.945
That's our way out.
Should we do something about this?

39:06.015 --> 39:08.142
That's our way out,
get us there.

39:21.629 --> 39:22.618
No.

39:23.164 --> 39:24.153
Get out of here!

39:25.467 --> 39:27.195
No!

40:25.087 --> 40:26.554
Kaufman.

40:26.889 --> 40:28.186
The one that got away.

40:28.257 --> 40:29.724
That's right.

40:30.158 --> 40:33.093
Remember you said we should talk
when I was less excited?

40:33.161 --> 40:34.889
I'm a lot less excited
right now.

40:34.962 --> 40:36.589
What do you want, Mr. DeMora?

40:36.864 --> 40:39.856
You might have noticed that
I had to leave in a hurry...

40:39.934 --> 40:42.869
so I didn't get a chance
to take my money out of your bank.

40:42.937 --> 40:45.063
I'd like you to handle
that withdrawal for me.

40:45.138 --> 40:48.073
With interest: $5 million.

40:48.575 --> 40:51.601
Or I'm gonna blow you
out of your fucking castle.

40:51.678 --> 40:53.270
Because I got Dead Reckoning.

40:53.914 --> 40:55.472
That's unfortunate.

40:55.549 --> 40:57.982
Well, unfortunate for you,
perhaps.

40:58.284 --> 41:00.218
I want you to put that money
on a boat...

41:00.286 --> 41:03.517
and send it across the river to the South Side,
10th Street Pier.

41:03.589 --> 41:05.557
One man to drive the boat,
no more.

41:05.891 --> 41:07.983
You have till midnight,
that's two and a half hours.

41:08.059 --> 41:10.289
I won't be there, and Dead
Reckoning won't be there.

41:10.361 --> 41:13.489
But I'll know if it happens, and
I'll know if it doesn't happen.

41:13.565 --> 41:14.657
Copy?

41:19.169 --> 41:20.363
Trouble?

41:20.571 --> 41:22.732
In a world where the dead
are returning to life...

41:22.873 --> 41:25.842
the world "trouble"
loses much of its meaning.

41:26.376 --> 41:29.004
He wants money.
Pay him.

41:29.179 --> 41:31.612
We don't negotiate
with terrorists.

41:33.583 --> 41:35.448
We have other options.

41:37.286 --> 41:39.516
Denbo. Give me Denbo.

41:41.324 --> 41:43.553
Get up. You're coming with me.

41:45.627 --> 41:48.528
Where you taking him?
Don't worry.

41:49.631 --> 41:51.622
Where are you taking him?

41:56.537 --> 41:59.506
You take care of him?
Hell, yeah.

42:01.575 --> 42:04.668
He pulled me out of the fire.

42:05.645 --> 42:07.010
It was bad.

42:09.215 --> 42:11.945
Just look at me,
you can tell it was bad.

42:19.791 --> 42:23.784
Mr. Denbo,
can I offer you a drink?

42:23.862 --> 42:26.729
I don't drink.
Why am I here?

42:27.298 --> 42:30.392
We want you to repossess a
vehicle that belongs to us...

42:30.468 --> 42:32.868
a vehicle that you
designed, Mr. Denbo.

42:32.937 --> 42:35.963
Dead Reckoning has been stolen
by your second-in-command...

42:36.040 --> 42:38.065
who I want captured
or killed...

42:38.142 --> 42:41.440
and I want my $2 million
piece of equipment returned.

42:41.511 --> 42:42.773
My truck.

42:43.413 --> 42:46.712
My truck, which has guns.

42:46.983 --> 42:48.473
Powerful guns.

42:48.685 --> 42:50.117
It'll do
a great deal of damage...

42:50.185 --> 42:52.312
if they're aimed
at this city.

42:52.388 --> 42:54.322
Why don't you just
send out your troops?

42:54.390 --> 42:56.449
I can send 50 men
against that thing...

42:56.525 --> 43:00.154
and they'd come back in
body bags. Now, Cholo was your man.

43:00.262 --> 43:03.822
Maybe you can get close enough
to do what has to be done.

43:04.899 --> 43:07.390
It's a good thing
I'm still in town.

43:08.636 --> 43:10.399
See, I bought a car.

43:10.638 --> 43:13.162
I was going to drive out
of here, but it disappeared.

43:13.240 --> 43:15.231
I guess someone
didn't want me to leave.

43:15.308 --> 43:17.333
You're a very popular man.

43:21.815 --> 43:24.578
How much are your services
going to cost me?

43:24.650 --> 43:28.211
A vehicle, enough weapons
and ammunition to go north.

43:28.654 --> 43:31.646
But there's nothing up north.
That's the idea.

43:32.491 --> 43:34.958
There's one more thing:
My friends, they go with me.

43:35.026 --> 43:36.357
Take them.

43:38.663 --> 43:42.258
Can you find Dead Reckoning,
quickly?

43:42.333 --> 43:44.130
How quickly?
Midnight.

43:45.170 --> 43:46.636
I have a way.

43:50.941 --> 43:53.000
Mouse, there are three things
a man must do alone:

43:53.077 --> 43:55.978
Be born, die, and we all know
the other one, don't we?

43:56.046 --> 43:58.570
Yeah, okay, Cholo. Just don't
leave me here alone too long...

43:58.648 --> 44:01.378
Two hours max. Give me a call. Let
me know if we're rich or not.

44:01.451 --> 44:02.577
All right, two hours.

44:02.652 --> 44:04.244
Give him something
for the nerves.

44:04.320 --> 44:06.311
Something for the nerves.

44:08.091 --> 44:09.990
Stay real. Okay.

45:43.177 --> 45:47.011
Can't believe you guys are
turning me into a fucking boy scout.

45:48.549 --> 45:49.880
Not a boy.

45:50.150 --> 45:52.413
You don't have to come out
if you don't want to.

45:52.485 --> 45:54.146
I didn't say that.

45:54.987 --> 45:59.253
Some shit, though, going out
to save Kaufman's ass.

45:59.492 --> 46:00.925
I'm not doing this
for Kaufman.

46:00.993 --> 46:02.289
This is for the people
in the city.

46:02.360 --> 46:06.023
What do you think's going to
happen to them if Cholo shells the Green?

46:06.097 --> 46:08.088
Okay. I'm with you.

46:09.634 --> 46:11.829
No, I like the ones
I already got.

46:11.903 --> 46:14.393
This piece
fires 14 rounds a second.

46:15.306 --> 46:17.604
I don't normally need
that many.

46:18.843 --> 46:21.175
I don't normally
talk to retards.

46:24.914 --> 46:27.041
Pretty easy to make fun
of some people, huh?

46:27.116 --> 46:29.949
I could make
a whole lot of fun out of you.

46:31.221 --> 46:32.950
I'll take this one.

46:35.425 --> 46:36.948
He thinks
he's taking care of you.

46:37.025 --> 46:38.049
He does.

46:38.126 --> 46:39.821
Without his guns,
I'd be dead by now.

46:39.895 --> 46:42.227
Without you,
he'd be dead by now.

46:42.631 --> 46:43.689
Fair trade.

46:43.765 --> 46:47.030
Riley, these guys are coming.

46:48.336 --> 46:50.463
Gentlemen and lady.

46:51.072 --> 46:53.267
Mr. Kaufman thought
you could use some support.

46:53.341 --> 46:55.935
Don't need any.
Nevertheless. Manolete.

46:56.110 --> 46:59.169
Manolete,
named after the bullfighter.

46:59.946 --> 47:03.006
Monica.
You can call me Motown.

47:04.317 --> 47:05.648
Pillsbury.

47:09.222 --> 47:12.588
I'm here to do something.
Why are we standing around?

47:13.359 --> 47:14.883
Let's do something.

47:18.898 --> 47:19.922
We taking the jeep?

47:19.999 --> 47:21.863
The Woody.
It's bigger, has guns.

47:26.804 --> 47:31.207
Jeez. Cholo made a mess. No.
Cholo didn't do all this.

47:31.843 --> 47:34.333
This is stenches.
A lot of them.

47:34.945 --> 47:36.572
Maybe still here.

47:39.483 --> 47:41.883
That's where they came in.
Look.

47:41.952 --> 47:43.510
That's where they went out.

47:43.587 --> 47:47.078
Trying to get to the city.
I'm going to go get the ammo.

47:47.156 --> 47:49.283
Crank up the Woody, Charlie.

47:50.026 --> 47:51.493
Make sure
she doesn't hurt herself.

47:51.560 --> 47:53.152
I can take care of myself,
okay?

47:53.229 --> 47:56.459
Fine. Charlie, make sure
she doesn't hurt anyone else.

47:56.531 --> 47:58.192
You, come with me.

48:02.370 --> 48:04.031
Walkers, Mr. Denbo?

48:04.105 --> 48:05.834
And moving toward the city.

48:05.907 --> 48:08.704
They'll never get across the river.
I wouldn't be so sure.

48:09.176 --> 48:10.905
They learned
how to work together.

48:10.978 --> 48:12.878
They're mindless
walking corpses...

48:12.947 --> 48:14.141
and many of us
will be, too...

48:14.214 --> 48:16.842
if you don't stay focused
on the task at hand.

48:18.052 --> 48:21.179
Zombies, man.
They creep me out.

48:21.621 --> 48:23.748
Do you really think they
can get across the water?

48:23.823 --> 48:26.087
If you asked me that a week
ago, I would have said no.

48:26.159 --> 48:27.524
But now...

48:28.561 --> 48:31.427
One way or the other, we got to
get our hands on Dead Reckoning.

48:31.496 --> 48:33.726
There's more of them
out there.

48:33.966 --> 48:36.764
I can hear them.
They're always out there.

48:37.536 --> 48:40.767
You're all right?
Yeah, no problem.

48:51.048 --> 48:52.674
Woody's in there.

49:08.297 --> 49:12.358
Who's got the keys, guys?
No keys to get. Melted.

49:12.768 --> 49:16.203
Screw the keys. Let's just
hot-wire the fucking thing.

49:24.846 --> 49:26.040
Yellow to red.

49:26.114 --> 49:29.276
What the fuck does a Samoan know
about hot-wiring a fucking car?

49:29.349 --> 49:32.409
Fifty thousand cars stolen
in Samoa every year.

49:32.519 --> 49:34.919
Yeah? Well,
a million in Detroit.

49:34.988 --> 49:37.218
Detroit's got 50 million cars.

49:37.290 --> 49:41.089
Samoa: 50,000.
Every one stolen.

49:46.499 --> 49:48.023
Charlie.

49:48.800 --> 49:52.099
Why do you lick your rifle?
It catches the light.

49:54.606 --> 49:57.598
What light?
How can you see anything?

49:57.809 --> 49:59.071
Good eye.

50:01.945 --> 50:03.003
Hey.

50:04.014 --> 50:05.242
Charlie?

50:06.650 --> 50:07.776
Shit!

50:12.922 --> 50:14.947
Off-center, but I got him.

50:16.759 --> 50:17.987
Awesome, man.

50:24.900 --> 50:27.425
Got a flashlight?
Yeah.

50:39.346 --> 50:40.938
Brubaker?

50:47.754 --> 50:49.244
Hey, Brubaker?

50:51.758 --> 50:53.521
Brubaker, you there?

50:54.894 --> 50:56.418
Hear that?
Yeah.

51:14.512 --> 51:17.072
All right, keep that thing
shining. Let's get ammo.

51:17.148 --> 51:19.809
There's. 50 caliber
around here somewhere.

51:19.883 --> 51:21.680
Great. Here's the. 50.

51:34.096 --> 51:35.563
Jesus Christ.

51:46.374 --> 51:49.343
No, not in here.
Think about where we are.

51:50.111 --> 51:51.601
Take a breath.

51:53.381 --> 51:55.041
Choose your shots.

52:26.077 --> 52:28.237
We're even.
Not.

52:28.979 --> 52:31.607
That hurt. I didn't hurt you.

52:35.886 --> 52:37.251
I got it.

52:48.631 --> 52:49.859
Oh, God.

53:00.676 --> 53:02.336
Is he bit?
Yeah.

53:04.412 --> 53:05.436
Go!

53:33.372 --> 53:35.237
How long does he have?

53:36.808 --> 53:40.972
Had a little brother bit. He took
less than an hour before he turned.

53:41.946 --> 53:43.846
And then what happened?

53:45.149 --> 53:46.514
I shot him.

53:48.785 --> 53:50.980
You said nothing bad
ever happened to you.

53:51.054 --> 53:53.181
That happened to my brother.

53:54.491 --> 53:57.392
Yeah. Dead is dead.

54:01.664 --> 54:04.155
And that ain't you or me.

54:10.972 --> 54:13.463
I'm sorry.
No! No!

54:31.458 --> 54:33.982
I recognize that
some of you are concerned...

54:34.060 --> 54:36.051
and I wanna assure you...

54:36.496 --> 54:39.932
that if anything goes wrong,
measures have been taken.

54:40.199 --> 54:43.463
I've established outposts
with food and supplies...

54:43.535 --> 54:45.833
that will support us
on our way.

54:46.038 --> 54:49.201
On our way to where?
Anywhere that we want to go.

54:49.308 --> 54:51.868
Alternative sites have been
chosen for us and our families...

54:51.943 --> 54:54.968
as well as
necessary support personnel.

54:55.046 --> 54:56.536
What about all the others?

54:56.614 --> 54:58.479
All the others
can be replaced by others.

54:58.549 --> 55:00.744
Boss.
You're interrupting me, Bill.

55:01.118 --> 55:02.346
It's bad timing.

55:02.453 --> 55:06.013
Just when I was talking about
how people can be replaced.

55:06.156 --> 55:09.717
A day may come when you earn
yourself some responsibilities.

55:09.793 --> 55:12.023
But right now
the responsibilities are mine.

55:12.095 --> 55:13.722
They're all mine.

55:13.963 --> 55:16.488
It was my ingenuity
that took an old world...

55:16.566 --> 55:18.430
and made it
into something new.

55:18.500 --> 55:20.991
I put up the fences
to make it safe.

55:21.136 --> 55:24.299
I hired the soldiers
and paid for their training.

55:24.373 --> 55:29.036
I kept the people off the streets
by giving them games and vices...

55:29.477 --> 55:31.240
which cost me money.

55:31.312 --> 55:33.678
But I spend it because
the responsibility is mine.

55:33.748 --> 55:37.548
Now, do you understand the
meaning of the word responsibility?

55:38.720 --> 55:41.449
We have to do
what we have to do.

55:44.558 --> 55:47.152
Foxy, I know
I'm never gonna be great.

55:47.227 --> 55:49.354
I'm never gonna be on the list
of names of people...

55:49.429 --> 55:52.056
who done great things
because I don't do anything.

55:52.131 --> 55:53.621
Not one thing.

55:55.067 --> 55:57.433
If it wasn't for this truck,
I wouldn't be any different...

55:57.503 --> 55:59.300
than that poor Mexican bastard
out there.

55:59.372 --> 56:01.806
Cholo, look,
Kaufman might not pay.

56:02.174 --> 56:03.902
Kaufman's gonna pay, man.

56:03.975 --> 56:07.433
But if he doesn't, he knows
I'm gonna do a jihad on his ass.

56:29.098 --> 56:31.293
When you hit
Route 6, take a right.

56:31.367 --> 56:33.665
How do you know
which way to go?

56:34.170 --> 56:36.331
Homing device.
Cool.

56:46.548 --> 56:48.742
How long
since you been out here?

56:48.816 --> 56:50.579
I've never been out.

56:51.986 --> 56:56.082
I've lived in the city
since it was a real city.

56:58.793 --> 57:00.123
Pull over.

57:04.063 --> 57:05.826
Cover them, Charlie.

57:06.800 --> 57:09.826
All right, you're working for
Kaufman, I'm working for Kaufman.

57:09.903 --> 57:11.335
My job is to stop Cholo.

57:11.403 --> 57:15.897
Your job is to bring the truck
back, with or without me, right?

57:15.974 --> 57:18.772
Not without you, no.
Well, that means yes.

57:18.844 --> 57:20.106
Here's what's going to happen.

57:20.179 --> 57:23.204
I'm going to do my job.
You're not going to get to do yours.

57:23.281 --> 57:25.943
Kaufman is never going to see
Dead Reckoning again.

57:26.017 --> 57:29.077
And when I get it, I'm
gonna do what I want with it.

57:29.153 --> 57:32.953
Anyone has any problems with
that, you can get out right here.

57:34.257 --> 57:37.351
Some choice.
No choice. Close door.

57:39.196 --> 57:41.460
Keep them covered,
Charlie.  Wait.

57:41.531 --> 57:43.260
You made us come
all the way out here...

57:43.333 --> 57:45.163
just to steal a fucking truck?

57:45.234 --> 57:46.792
You made a deal, Riley.

57:46.869 --> 57:49.133
You're going back on a deal.
You never done that before.

57:49.205 --> 57:51.435
If Cholo shells the Green,
all deals are off.

57:52.708 --> 57:54.903
If something worse happens,
I don't know about you...

57:54.977 --> 57:57.774
but I don't want to be
out here in a car without a roof.

58:07.955 --> 58:09.923
Mouse, you got anything?

58:10.190 --> 58:12.420
No boat, no money, no nothing.

58:20.466 --> 58:22.195
Load the six-packs.

01:00:19.275 --> 01:00:20.799
Six-pack loaded.

01:00:20.876 --> 01:00:23.106
All right, load the other six.

01:00:23.345 --> 01:00:26.246
We're not gonna show them
any goddamn mercy.

01:00:32.921 --> 01:00:35.115
I know where
Cholo's going. Where?

01:00:35.189 --> 01:00:37.589
Mount Washington,
overlooks the city.

01:00:37.658 --> 01:00:38.852
We can beat him there.

01:00:38.926 --> 01:00:40.894
In that truck, he's
gotta take the main roads.

01:00:40.961 --> 01:00:43.122
We can take the back streets. Right.

01:00:43.197 --> 01:00:45.563
Make a right on Ivy, then
take a left on Westminster.

01:00:45.633 --> 01:00:47.964
You wanna go up the hill?
Yes, I'm wanna go up the hill.

01:00:48.034 --> 01:00:49.831
Let's go up the hill.

01:02:03.570 --> 01:02:04.798
Almost midnight, sir.

01:02:04.871 --> 01:02:06.497
Pack us up.
We might be leaving.

01:02:06.572 --> 01:02:07.596
In the boat?

01:02:07.673 --> 01:02:09.300
I'd rather be taking
Dead Reckoning...

01:02:09.375 --> 01:02:11.036
but not available.

01:02:27.958 --> 01:02:30.085
From this hillside,
they can shell the Green.

01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:32.219
They're gonna be coming up
this road.

01:02:32.296 --> 01:02:34.321
Pull in around the corner.

01:03:19.139 --> 01:03:20.333
All right, they're coming.

01:03:20.406 --> 01:03:22.374
You guys stay here
and keep real quiet.

01:03:22.442 --> 01:03:24.500
I'm going to try
and talk my way inside.

01:03:25.677 --> 01:03:27.736
He's going to steal that truck
and leave us here.

01:03:27.813 --> 01:03:29.303
Riley would never do that.

01:03:29.381 --> 01:03:31.474
Just look at him, you can
tell he'd never do that.

01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:34.144
I like that man.
You, go help him.

01:03:35.154 --> 01:03:36.142
Go.

01:03:51.802 --> 01:03:53.997
Everything's okay back there.

01:03:54.704 --> 01:03:56.899
It's too late
to send me back.

01:03:57.207 --> 01:03:58.468
Now, put that thing away.

01:03:58.541 --> 01:04:01.738
Put on your best Sunday smile,
and just try to look friendly.

01:04:01.811 --> 01:04:03.301
I am friendly.

01:04:05.514 --> 01:04:07.744
Hey, Cholo.
Take a look at this.

01:04:07.817 --> 01:04:09.807
It's Denbo and his idiot.

01:04:10.485 --> 01:04:12.510
All right. Stop the truck.

01:04:14.856 --> 01:04:16.346
Come on, here.

01:04:21.361 --> 01:04:23.829
So, how did you get up here?
In the Woody.

01:04:23.897 --> 01:04:25.194
I tracked you with this.

01:04:25.265 --> 01:04:26.289
Forgot to tell you...

01:04:26.366 --> 01:04:28.459
the truck's got a
little transmitter in her belly.

01:04:28.535 --> 01:04:30.196
You were always a smart guy.

01:04:30.270 --> 01:04:32.067
Always a lot smarter
than me, man.

01:04:32.139 --> 01:04:33.400
That's not saying much.

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:36.340
Open up.
What, are you fucking nuts?

01:04:36.409 --> 01:04:37.637
Open up.

01:04:50.522 --> 01:04:51.989
Hey, Charlie.

01:04:55.426 --> 01:04:57.451
So, who's the smart one now?

01:04:57.528 --> 01:04:58.756
Thought you would have quit...

01:04:58.829 --> 01:05:01.457
but here you are still working for
the man, aren't you, Riley?

01:05:01.532 --> 01:05:03.466
What? Kaufman sent you up
to take care of me?

01:05:03.534 --> 01:05:04.626
Yeah.

01:05:05.302 --> 01:05:07.929
Takes a true friend to stab you
right in the front, doesn't it?

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:10.501
That man pulls the trigger,
he's dead.

01:05:14.611 --> 01:05:16.476
Who else is out there?

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:20.378
Kaufman sent some guys with
us. We took care of them.

01:05:26.088 --> 01:05:27.419
Cover him.

01:05:28.156 --> 01:05:30.385
Pretty Boy,
lock in the target.

01:05:45.338 --> 01:05:46.771
We're running out of time.

01:05:47.173 --> 01:05:48.663
I got you now.

01:06:55.502 --> 01:06:56.969
You hit
that tower square on...

01:06:57.037 --> 01:06:58.868
you're gonna kill
a lot of innocent people.

01:06:58.939 --> 01:07:02.203
You miss, you hit the city, you're
gonna kill a lot of our friends.

01:07:02.275 --> 01:07:03.799
Want to know
who killed our friends?

01:07:03.876 --> 01:07:05.969
Kaufman is the one
that's killed our friends.

01:07:06.045 --> 01:07:08.912
Every time I took out his garbage,
I took out one of our friends...

01:07:08.982 --> 01:07:10.609
people he wanted
off the streets.

01:07:10.683 --> 01:07:13.014
He turned me into a goon, then
he's gonna piss all over me?

01:07:13.085 --> 01:07:14.109
I don't think so.

01:07:22.460 --> 01:07:24.291
What are you gonna get
out of this, Cholo?

01:07:24.395 --> 01:07:25.657
Hopefully my money.

01:07:26.130 --> 01:07:28.928
Money burns.
Yeah, not if it's in a vault.

01:07:34.237 --> 01:07:37.331
All right, Mr. K.,
won't be needing you anymore.

01:07:45.914 --> 01:07:47.814
You set this right?
Yes.

01:07:48.350 --> 01:07:50.875
Riley, you did something to it
with your fucking little toy.

01:07:50.953 --> 01:07:53.547
This? What the fuck did you do? Fix it.

01:07:55.691 --> 01:07:57.521
Fix it.
Not a fucking chance.

01:08:06.567 --> 01:08:08.431
Cholo, look out.

01:08:30.654 --> 01:08:31.747
Fuck.

01:08:38.496 --> 01:08:40.054
You know, Riley...

01:08:40.131 --> 01:08:42.564
there's something about you
that I've always really hated.

01:08:42.633 --> 01:08:44.692
You're still here, aren't you?
What do you care?

01:08:44.768 --> 01:08:47.259
You got what you wanted.
You're hit.

01:08:47.537 --> 01:08:48.835
How you doing in there,
Charlie?

01:08:48.906 --> 01:08:50.635
I'm being friendly.

01:08:55.411 --> 01:08:57.402
What's in the bags?
Money.

01:08:57.814 --> 01:08:59.212
Whose money?

01:09:01.317 --> 01:09:03.308
Watch out. Get down. Quick.

01:09:04.886 --> 01:09:05.978
Ours.

01:09:10.325 --> 01:09:11.952
Yes?
We got Cholo.

01:09:14.395 --> 01:09:16.124
Kaufman.
I'm here.

01:09:17.631 --> 01:09:19.531
I just did something...

01:09:20.634 --> 01:09:22.932
I might not have done
otherwise.

01:09:31.511 --> 01:09:33.001
You lied to me, Denbo.

01:09:33.078 --> 01:09:35.569
You didn't get DeMora.
He's shooting at us.

01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:38.439
That's not Cholo, Mr. Kaufman.

01:09:40.685 --> 01:09:43.051
Holy shit.
They got across the river.

01:09:43.122 --> 01:09:44.247
Look at that.

01:09:44.323 --> 01:09:45.915
I didn't even have to
blow the place up.

01:09:45.991 --> 01:09:47.457
The fucking stenches
did it for me.

01:09:54.131 --> 01:09:57.568
We're going back to the city
to see if we can help. Pick him up.

01:09:57.635 --> 01:09:59.262
Where we going, man?
What are we doing?

01:09:59.337 --> 01:10:02.430
Easy, Gargantua, come on.
Get him inside. Quick.

01:10:02.572 --> 01:10:04.802
Not this horse.
Not this horse.

01:10:05.675 --> 01:10:07.575
Take that Woody
if you still got it.

01:10:07.644 --> 01:10:09.441
Fine.
You got me, too.

01:10:10.313 --> 01:10:11.507
Thanks.

01:10:12.182 --> 01:10:13.580
Anyone else?

01:10:16.752 --> 01:10:17.912
Where you gonna go, Cholo?

01:10:17.987 --> 01:10:19.887
There's always that outpost
in Cleveland.

01:10:19.955 --> 01:10:22.116
Haven't heard from them
in a while.

01:10:22.191 --> 01:10:23.623
Take my chances.

01:10:26.494 --> 01:10:28.155
You have no right.

01:10:29.731 --> 01:10:30.823
No right.

01:10:32.267 --> 01:10:34.633
Woody's around the corner.
Guns and ammo inside.

01:10:34.702 --> 01:10:35.895
Thanks.

01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:38.404
Get us back on the main road.

01:10:43.477 --> 01:10:46.240
You have blood, here.
We almost lost you there.

01:10:46.612 --> 01:10:48.375
You all right?
Yeah.

01:10:48.447 --> 01:10:50.745
You want to be really helpful,
roll me one.

01:10:50.816 --> 01:10:52.340
Yeah, all right.

01:11:32.487 --> 01:11:35.251
What was built to keep people
safe is gonna trap them inside.

01:11:38.160 --> 01:11:39.752
This is Denbo
in the Reckoning.

01:11:39.828 --> 01:11:41.762
Open up those fences
and let the people out.

01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:44.093
The fences are still hot. We
can't cut the juice from here.

01:11:44.165 --> 01:11:45.826
We've been trying to call
the power station.

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:47.128
There's no one
left over there.

01:11:47.201 --> 01:11:48.668
We got to get the fuck
out of here.

01:11:48.769 --> 01:11:50.100
There's no one left here,
either.

01:11:50.171 --> 01:11:51.399
Move it.

01:11:55.542 --> 01:11:56.907
We can rocket those fences.

01:11:56.977 --> 01:11:58.342
Got to get across river.

01:11:58.411 --> 01:12:00.743
The bridges into the
city, they're all bricked up.

01:12:00.814 --> 01:12:02.543
Let's just fucking
blast our way through.

01:12:02.616 --> 01:12:03.674
No, we can't do that.

01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:06.582
There's a war going on over
there. We cross any of these bridges...

01:12:06.652 --> 01:12:08.483
we're gonna end up
right in the middle of it.

01:12:08.554 --> 01:12:10.488
We have to come in
outside of the Throat.

01:12:13.125 --> 01:12:15.059
Somehow, Fox, I thought
we'd be traveling...

01:12:15.127 --> 01:12:17.185
in a lot better style
than this, baby.

01:12:17.262 --> 01:12:19.321
At least we're still
fucking traveling, brother.

01:12:20.498 --> 01:12:21.590
What?

01:12:35.812 --> 01:12:37.712
Come on, Fox, let's
get the hell out of here.

01:12:56.264 --> 01:12:57.356
What?

01:13:00.802 --> 01:13:02.666
Can you fucking believe it?

01:13:02.736 --> 01:13:05.102
Nothing works out
the way you want it to.

01:13:05.172 --> 01:13:08.664
There's something always comes
around the corner and just gets you.

01:13:13.513 --> 01:13:15.378
It's your choice, bro.

01:13:18.551 --> 01:13:21.645
I always wanted to see
how the other half lives.

01:13:25.957 --> 01:13:27.720
The old J&L can take us over.

01:13:27.793 --> 01:13:29.283
It's a drawbridge.
They leave it up.

01:13:29.361 --> 01:13:31.352
That means it's not guarded.
Can you get us there?

01:13:31.430 --> 01:13:32.454
Yeah.
Let's go.

01:15:57.596 --> 01:15:59.427
I can stay with you,
if you want.

01:15:59.498 --> 01:16:00.692
No. No.

01:16:00.999 --> 01:16:03.229
This is between me
and the man.

01:16:07.171 --> 01:16:08.934
Fox, she's all yours.

01:16:09.006 --> 01:16:11.941
Hope you do better
than you did with me, man.

01:16:12.510 --> 01:16:13.602
Yeah.

01:16:50.644 --> 01:16:52.271
Holy shit!

01:16:52.880 --> 01:16:55.007
A disturbance
has been reported...

01:16:55.082 --> 01:16:56.344
on the outskirts of the city.

01:16:56.416 --> 01:16:57.906
There's no reason
to believe...

01:16:57.985 --> 01:17:00.248
that Fiddler's Green
could ever be compromised.

01:17:00.319 --> 01:17:04.585
But we suggest that residents report any sightings
of unusual behavior.

01:18:09.849 --> 01:18:13.285
There it is. Let's hope
it's still wired into the grid.

01:18:17.591 --> 01:18:19.252
Shut the hatch, just in case.

01:18:19.325 --> 01:18:22.419
When I get the bridge down,
you come pick me up.

01:18:28.367 --> 01:18:30.698
How do you work this thing?
It's just like a video game.

01:18:39.277 --> 01:18:41.404
What the fuck are you doing?

01:18:41.512 --> 01:18:43.308
Making myself useful.

01:18:53.522 --> 01:18:55.422
Wait. Wait. Stop. Stop!

01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:24.812
Stenches.

01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:27.750
Starboard.

01:19:31.991 --> 01:19:33.891
They're behind us, too.

01:19:41.066 --> 01:19:42.795
I can't get a shot.

01:20:07.957 --> 01:20:09.288
Now shoot!

01:20:38.318 --> 01:20:40.411
They'll never get in here.
Neither will Riley.

01:20:40.487 --> 01:20:42.284
Unlock the
roof hatch, Pretty Boy.

01:20:46.692 --> 01:20:47.954
Oh, shit.

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:50.785
Riley, go for the roof.
Okay.

01:21:04.042 --> 01:21:05.134
Roll!

01:21:08.613 --> 01:21:10.546
What are you doing? Forward!

01:21:10.614 --> 01:21:11.876
I'm gonna
shake these bastards.

01:22:01.461 --> 01:22:02.393
Get out of the way.

01:22:03.997 --> 01:22:05.157
Hello?

01:22:05.465 --> 01:22:06.624
Hello?

01:22:10.569 --> 01:22:12.036
What is it?
Is something going on?

01:22:12.104 --> 01:22:13.594
Stenches!

01:22:24.782 --> 01:22:26.010
We're fucked.

01:22:27.518 --> 01:22:29.041
Angle the mortars
for the Throat...

01:22:29.119 --> 01:22:30.950
and send up some sky flowers.

01:22:31.021 --> 01:22:32.750
Got her!

01:22:50.172 --> 01:22:51.661
Oh, thank God.

01:23:29.708 --> 01:23:31.175
Watch it now.

01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:33.475
Oh, my God.

01:23:35.013 --> 01:23:36.775
Downstairs. The car.

01:23:42.586 --> 01:23:44.884
You bastards!
You have no right!

01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:52.890
Mr. Kaufman, come on,
let's go.

01:24:00.569 --> 01:24:02.764
Mr. Kaufman
wants you to know...

01:24:02.838 --> 01:24:04.430
All right,
we're going to the boat.

01:24:04.506 --> 01:24:06.531
... he has dedicated himself
to your well-being.

01:24:06.608 --> 01:24:08.166
Be careful
when you open that door.

01:24:08.243 --> 01:24:11.336
Should I call the crew, sir?
No, I'll call them.

01:24:33.198 --> 01:24:34.927
God damn it.

01:24:36.368 --> 01:24:37.858
What the fuck?

01:24:51.716 --> 01:24:53.274
Goodbye, Mr. K.

01:24:53.351 --> 01:24:56.410
Come back here, you son of a
bitch. You got the fucking keys.

01:26:51.258 --> 01:26:53.226
Fucking spic bastard.

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:25.347
Nah. You're dead.

01:27:27.091 --> 01:27:29.559
Oh, my God. You are dead.

01:28:03.090 --> 01:28:05.388
Number 1's clear.
Going for Number 2.

01:28:05.459 --> 01:28:07.086
I don't normally need
that many.

01:28:07.161 --> 01:28:09.219
Don't bother. Come on down.

01:28:12.765 --> 01:28:13.993
Blow the fences.

01:28:46.296 --> 01:28:48.526
Sky flowers
don't work no more.

01:28:50.534 --> 01:28:51.694
Shoot.

01:28:52.869 --> 01:28:54.597
But there's people.

01:28:54.970 --> 01:28:57.768
Those people are all dead.
Shoot, Charlie.

01:29:24.298 --> 01:29:25.822
We're too late.

01:29:26.867 --> 01:29:27.890
No.

01:29:29.235 --> 01:29:30.327
Look.

01:29:48.386 --> 01:29:49.910
You saved them.

01:30:06.836 --> 01:30:08.736
You staying or leaving?

01:30:09.105 --> 01:30:10.697
You?
Leaving.

01:30:10.974 --> 01:30:13.203
Unless you need my help.
No.

01:30:13.642 --> 01:30:14.870
Why don't you stick around?

01:30:14.943 --> 01:30:17.673
We could turn this place into
what we always wanted it to be.

01:30:17.746 --> 01:30:18.906
Maybe.

01:30:19.948 --> 01:30:23.111
Then what will we turn into?
We'll see, won't we?

01:30:28.956 --> 01:30:31.447
You want to go
to Canada now, Riley?

01:30:31.692 --> 01:30:33.922
Sure, if no one
has any objections.

01:30:33.995 --> 01:30:36.087
No, we'll take you with us.

01:30:36.896 --> 01:30:38.625
I'll try to make myself
useful.

01:30:39.199 --> 01:30:42.191
Anchor, load the guns.
We're hitting the road.

01:30:56.081 --> 01:30:57.571
Now we can go.

01:31:34.115 --> 01:31:35.173
No.

01:31:35.483 --> 01:31:38.111
They're just looking
for a place to go.

01:31:40.388 --> 01:31:41.753
Same as us.

01:31:45.259 --> 01:31:47.625
Fire off what's left inside
those tubes.

01:31:47.695 --> 01:31:49.993
We're not gonna need it
anymore.

01:32:00.573 --> 01:32:02.063
Take us north.

01:32:12.063 --> 01:32:14.863
