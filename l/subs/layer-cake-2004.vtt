00:27.320 --> 00:31.780
When I was born,
the world was a far simpler place.

00:33.130 --> 00:36.890
It was all just cops and robbers.

00:49.310 --> 00:51.640
Fucking get down! Get down now!

00:51.850 --> 00:53.970
And you! Stay down! Stay down!

00:54.180 --> 00:56.010
But it wasn't for me.

00:58.250 --> 01:00.410
Then came the Summer of Love.

01:00.620 --> 01:03.820
Hashish and LSD
arrived on the scene.

01:12.830 --> 01:15.500
There were villains
locked away for 12 years...

01:15.700 --> 01:17.570
... for robbing a bank of 10 grand...

01:17.770 --> 01:20.430
... doing time with drippy hippies
doing 12 months...

01:20.640 --> 01:24.410
... for smuggling two million quid's
worth of puff.

01:24.610 --> 01:28.340
I mean, work it out, mate.
We're in the wrong fucking game.

01:30.180 --> 01:34.050
Drugs changed everything.

01:43.930 --> 01:47.890
Always remember that one day this
drug monkey-business will be legal.

01:48.100 --> 01:51.330
They won't leave it to people like me
when they figure out...

01:51.540 --> 01:57.340
... how much money there is to be
made: Not millions, fucking billions.

01:57.540 --> 02:02.210
Recreational Drugs plc.
Giving people what they want.

02:02.420 --> 02:05.390
Good times today, stupor tomorrow.

02:17.430 --> 02:18.920
But this is now.

02:19.130 --> 02:23.090
So, until prohibition ends,
make hay while the sun shines.

02:28.980 --> 02:31.440
I'm not a gangster.

02:31.650 --> 02:35.600
I'm a businessman whose commodity
happens to be cocaine.

02:35.820 --> 02:40.750
Ten years ago, Charlie was for pop
stars or a celebrity's birthday bash.

02:40.950 --> 02:44.980
It was demonized by Daily Mail
readers getting drunk in wine bars.

02:46.730 --> 02:49.490
Now they're my biggest clients.

02:50.800 --> 02:55.560
This is Clarkie. Double first
at Cambridge in Industrial Chemistry.

02:55.770 --> 02:58.570
Well, he's gotta pay off
his student loan somehow.

03:02.340 --> 03:04.740
Today, I only deal in kilos.

03:04.950 --> 03:06.610
Depending which tariff you use...

03:06.810 --> 03:10.440
... that'll cost you either 28 grand
or 15 years in prison...

03:10.650 --> 03:12.780
... which is more time than a rapist.

03:13.490 --> 03:15.580
C'est la vie.

03:15.790 --> 03:20.350
It is vital that we work
to a few golden rules.

03:20.560 --> 03:22.500
Always work in a small team.

03:22.700 --> 03:27.460
Keep a very low profile. Only deal
with people who come recommended.

03:27.670 --> 03:29.360
It's like selling anything:

03:29.570 --> 03:32.040
Washing machines,
handmade shoes, blowjobs.

03:32.240 --> 03:36.110
As long as you don't take the piss,
people will come back for more.

03:36.310 --> 03:40.610
That's not to say we don't weave that
magic that makes two kilos three...

03:40.810 --> 03:43.610
... but never be too greedy.

03:51.530 --> 03:53.050
Know and respect your enemy.

03:53.260 --> 03:57.860
It is only very, very stupid people
who think the law is stupid.

04:03.070 --> 04:05.330
And avoid like the fucking plague...

04:05.540 --> 04:08.510
... loud, attention-seeking
wannabe gangsters...

04:08.710 --> 04:11.340
... in it for the glory, to be a face,
to be a name.

04:11.550 --> 04:16.350
Hello, Slavo. Yeah, it's the Duke.

04:16.550 --> 04:19.990
Everything's sweet.
When can we meet?

04:20.190 --> 04:24.390
They don't mean to fuck up.
They just do.

04:33.130 --> 04:37.800
Forgive me for stating the obvious,
but stay away from the end-user.

04:38.740 --> 04:41.670
They are guaranteed
to bring you trouble.

04:41.880 --> 04:44.110
As do guns.

04:44.340 --> 04:46.610
I hate guns. And violence.

04:46.850 --> 04:50.180
But as some Roman general
once said:

04:50.380 --> 04:53.550
"If you seek peace, plan for war."

04:53.750 --> 04:57.710
Morty and his assistant Terry,
they watch my back.

04:57.920 --> 05:02.220
Morty learnt caution the hard way.
He did 10 years inside.

05:02.960 --> 05:05.430
He's my bridge
to the criminal world...

05:05.630 --> 05:08.530
... and he ensures that
the traffic is one-way.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.940
Look, there's Amsterdam,
and there's Oofdorfe... dorfe.

05:12.140 --> 05:15.770
Not a fucking clue.
None of them speak English.

05:15.980 --> 05:18.710
- Get in the car. I'm sure it's that way.
- Move up.

05:18.910 --> 05:21.810
- I bet you it's that way.
- We've already been that way.

05:22.020 --> 05:26.110
Yeah, but we're going to go
that way again. Give us the map.

05:27.290 --> 05:29.880
Oh, don't start, the pair of you.

05:30.090 --> 05:32.580
It's like being out with a pair of kids.

05:32.790 --> 05:36.630
- All day you've been moaning.
- It can't be that difficult.

05:36.830 --> 05:39.660
How many fucking greenhouses
can there be?

05:42.470 --> 05:44.630
Morty.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.310
Terence.

05:46.510 --> 05:47.800
Clarkie.

05:48.580 --> 05:53.880
Very, very important:
Pay your supplier prompt.

05:54.080 --> 05:58.380
In our case, that's Mr. Jimmy Price.
He's the top of the pyramid.

05:58.590 --> 06:02.520
Pay him. In full, on time, without fail,
no short counts.

06:02.720 --> 06:06.920
You get no second chances.
Jimmy calls the shots.

06:07.730 --> 06:09.590
Where the fuck is Gene?

06:09.830 --> 06:13.390
- I don't know. Ask me one on sport.
- What time does your watch tell?

06:13.600 --> 06:15.570
- The same as yours.
- He's never late.

06:15.770 --> 06:17.260
Shut the fuck up.

06:20.670 --> 06:22.200
Patience.

06:22.410 --> 06:25.070
Gene here is Jimmy's right-hand man.

06:25.380 --> 06:27.440
Been with him since way back.

06:27.650 --> 06:30.380
All the drugs and cash
go through Gene.

06:30.580 --> 06:32.980
Jimmy trusts him with his life.

06:38.020 --> 06:43.550
By the way, Jimmy would like to see
you tomorrow for a spot of lunch.

06:45.100 --> 06:48.430
Wait a minute. Is there a problem?

06:48.640 --> 06:53.230
Why does everybody assume there's
a problem because he wants a word?

06:53.440 --> 06:58.040
Maybe he's grateful.
He fucking should be.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.180
See you at Stoke Park at one.

07:04.280 --> 07:06.980
This is just so beautiful.

07:07.190 --> 07:09.550
We need to get in and out
of here sharpish.

07:09.760 --> 07:12.820
Paul and the tide isn’t going to wait.

07:23.540 --> 07:26.730
Everyone likes to walk
through a door marked "Private."

07:26.970 --> 07:30.500
Therefore, have a good reason
to be affluent.

07:30.710 --> 07:33.370
I own a share in a very successful
letting agency.

07:33.580 --> 07:37.810
It gives me an honest income.
Looks good on the self-assessment.

07:40.250 --> 07:45.090
Whereas years ago scallywags were
trying to get money out of banks...

07:45.290 --> 07:49.250
... now your problem is
how to get your ill-gotten gains in.

07:49.500 --> 07:52.400
That's a job for Mr. Singh.
He does my laundry.

07:52.600 --> 07:55.090
And in a week,
it will be ready for collection...

07:55.300 --> 08:00.710
... in the form of a nice clean check
for a round million.

08:02.240 --> 08:04.180
The business is on the up and up.

08:04.380 --> 08:07.510
But I've always said,
have a plan and stick to it.

08:07.710 --> 08:09.710
Quit while you're ahead.

08:09.920 --> 08:12.890
So barring any fuck-ups,
I'm leaving it all behind.

08:14.090 --> 08:16.080
No, we got the parcel.

08:16.290 --> 08:18.590
Yeah, better than expected, actually.

08:18.790 --> 08:22.460
It's just that things have gone
a little bit slightly turbo this end.

08:26.400 --> 08:28.130
Come on, boys, lively, lively.

08:28.340 --> 08:31.600
If we miss this tide, we're
not going anywhere till daylight.

08:31.810 --> 08:33.830
Paul, you isn’t being paid to moan.

08:34.039 --> 08:36.130
You're being paid to get
my cargo home.

08:37.039 --> 08:41.210
Come on, babe. You all right?
Careful here, it's a bit wobbly.

08:42.380 --> 08:46.880
Life is so fucking good,
I can taste it in my spit.

08:47.090 --> 08:52.680
I'll treat tomorrow's lunch like the Last
Supper, feign interest in his tales.

08:52.890 --> 08:55.260
And then leave quietly forever.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.420
This is pure class.

10:06.970 --> 10:09.330
Please, follow me, gentlemen.

10:09.540 --> 10:11.830
Mr. Price is in the Oval Room.

10:25.690 --> 10:30.850
- Your guests, Mr. Price.
- Thanks, Angelo. Welcome. Sit down.

10:31.060 --> 10:33.890
How is it with that
Paki accountant I put your way?

10:34.090 --> 10:37.190
- He still doing the business?
- Raj is doing a very good job.

10:37.400 --> 10:40.090
Good. Paying your bit
of straight-goer's tax, eh?

10:40.300 --> 10:42.130
We all have to do our bit.

10:42.340 --> 10:45.270
Say hello from me
next time you see him.

10:45.470 --> 10:49.200
You hungry? The grub here
will make your bollocks tingle.

10:49.540 --> 10:51.410
Let's eat.

10:57.820 --> 10:59.180
Right.

10:59.390 --> 11:02.840
We've got to test the "snap, crackle
and pop" factor on these.

11:03.060 --> 11:06.220
Don't ask me.
I isn’t fucking touching them.

11:06.430 --> 11:08.520
You are a miserable bastard,
you really are.

11:13.630 --> 11:15.290
- Brian.
- What?

11:15.500 --> 11:19.400
Sit down, mate.
Got a little treat for you.

11:22.540 --> 11:24.480
Help yourself.

11:42.130 --> 11:44.220
A little privacy, please, Angelo.

11:54.140 --> 11:56.130
What do you want, son?

11:57.310 --> 12:00.770
- Excuse me?
- In life. What are you after?

12:02.280 --> 12:06.980
A shot at the title?
A seat by the band?

12:10.620 --> 12:16.290
Well, I don't know, Mr. Price.
That's a very expansive question.

12:16.500 --> 12:18.830
Right, expansive. Good answer.

12:19.030 --> 12:22.520
Years ago, people would've
thought you were a homosexual...

12:22.740 --> 12:24.360
...using a word like "expansive."

12:24.570 --> 12:27.200
- You're not a homosexual, are you?
- No.

12:27.410 --> 12:30.400
- Not behind with the rent?
- No.

12:30.610 --> 12:32.840
No, I didn't think you were.

12:33.050 --> 12:36.170
No harm in it, I suppose.
Times change.

12:38.020 --> 12:42.220
You know why people like you
can't leave this business?

12:45.860 --> 12:50.160
Because you make too much money
for people like me.

12:50.360 --> 12:53.990
Anyway, I'll get to the point.
I need a favour.

12:54.200 --> 12:57.260
I need someone who's a bit cute,
a smooth operator.

12:57.470 --> 13:00.800
Not a two-a-penny loudmouth.
Too many grasses around.

13:02.440 --> 13:06.640
- It would be a pleasure, Mr. Price.
- Jimmy. You can call me Jimmy.

13:06.980 --> 13:11.850
Now, this favour. It's not for me, truth
be told. It's for a good friend of mine.

13:13.390 --> 13:16.450
Like a blood brother.
We were at school together.

13:16.660 --> 13:18.420
Now he's a right wheeler-dealer.

13:18.630 --> 13:21.590
Flinging up skyscrapers.
His wife's a proper blue blood.

13:21.800 --> 13:25.630
I'll give you a clue. Eddie Temple.

13:25.830 --> 13:28.160
Does that name
mean anything to you?

13:28.370 --> 13:31.100
- I know who you mean.
- Now, Eddie's got a daughter.

13:31.300 --> 13:33.200
Charlie, bless her.

13:33.440 --> 13:37.210
The light of his life.
He worships the ground she walks on.

13:38.310 --> 13:40.110
She's a proper beauty, Charlie.

13:40.310 --> 13:44.650
Or to give her correct moniker,
Charlie Spencer-Temple.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.340
But she isn’t behaving like a lady.

13:47.550 --> 13:50.680
She's hooked on the white powder
and loves a wrong one.

13:50.890 --> 13:54.660
This is where you come in, right?
You're going to find her.

13:56.200 --> 13:59.290
- Find her?
- She's gone missing.

13:59.500 --> 14:01.870
Well, you should get
a private detective.

14:02.070 --> 14:08.340
Oh, right. Some nosy ex-policeman,
still on the Scotland Yard payroll?

14:08.540 --> 14:12.670
She's done a runner from a drug
rehabilitation unit in the West Country.

14:12.880 --> 14:14.070
Rehab.

14:14.280 --> 14:19.950
She got loved up in there with
some lowlife crack head called Kinky.

14:20.150 --> 14:22.180
I reckon they've gone
back to London.

14:22.390 --> 14:23.980
I wouldn't know where to begin.

14:24.190 --> 14:28.150
Now and then we're asked to do
something beyond the call of duty.

14:28.390 --> 14:30.830
It's called sacrifice, son.

14:31.400 --> 14:34.920
Ask Gene. Ask Morty.

14:36.400 --> 14:39.460
- I'll do my best.
- You do your best and find her.

14:39.670 --> 14:42.230
Keep Mr. McGuire posted.

14:47.280 --> 14:50.310
I've also got a little business
more in your usual line.

14:50.520 --> 14:52.280
Gene will fill you in.

14:52.490 --> 14:54.540
Everything was to your satisfaction?

14:54.750 --> 14:57.380
- Fucking excellent, Angelo.
- Thank you.

15:01.530 --> 15:05.730
Details, details.
Things to do, things to get done.

15:05.930 --> 15:09.160
Don't bother me with details.
Just tell me when they're done.

15:09.400 --> 15:12.740
- Who said that, son?
- Winston Churchill?

15:13.110 --> 15:19.410
Close. No, I said it.
James Lionel Price. Good boy.

15:23.520 --> 15:25.950
I'll see you at the yard tomorrow.
Say, four.

15:26.150 --> 15:31.750
Tell you about that bit of business. I've
set up a meet for five with the Duke.

15:39.570 --> 15:42.930
- What's with him?
- He's just had one of these.

15:43.140 --> 15:45.370
These are super Es.
We'll make millions!

15:45.570 --> 15:49.270
I don't care. This is my boatyard.

15:49.480 --> 15:52.640
I want those pills and that fucking idiot
out of here now.

15:52.850 --> 15:55.750
- I can't afford to get nicked.
- Paul. Calm down, mate.

15:55.980 --> 15:59.650
I've got Gene coming down
with a buyer. You'll be in your whack.

16:00.220 --> 16:02.590
Here, chill. Have a pill.

16:05.290 --> 16:07.890
Gene, why are we doing business
with the Duke?

16:08.090 --> 16:10.690
Yeah, why are we
dealing with this joker?

16:10.900 --> 16:15.130
He's a fucking maniac, a relic, a
throwback, belongs to the Dark Ages.

16:15.340 --> 16:17.530
Will you just shut the fuck up?

16:17.740 --> 16:20.800
We're dealing with him because
he has one million Ecstasy pills...

16:21.040 --> 16:23.800
...of very high levels
of MDMA, okay?

16:24.040 --> 16:26.200
One million?

16:26.580 --> 16:29.570
Gene, that is a lot of pills.
What's the tax on that?

16:29.780 --> 16:31.770
Jimmy wants 50 percent netto.

16:31.990 --> 16:34.780
Love a bit of cloak-and-dagger,
this lot.

16:34.990 --> 16:38.120
Oh, yeah. Driving a bright yellow
Range Rover. Very subtle.

16:38.320 --> 16:41.490
Calm down. You'll feel better
once you've got your money.

16:41.690 --> 16:45.390
But how much can you spend
in Parkhurst or the Scrubs, Gene?

16:48.270 --> 16:50.000
Come on.

16:51.000 --> 16:55.630
Oh, don't go getting Duke at it. Jimmy
doesn't want him fucked about, okay?

16:55.840 --> 16:57.540
Who? Me?

16:57.910 --> 17:01.640
Don't you fucking talk to me
like I'm some kind of mug.

17:01.850 --> 17:06.790
Duke, don't take this personally.
It's business.

17:06.990 --> 17:09.150
You want to know
how much they're worth.

17:09.359 --> 17:11.550
Yes, fucking, please!

17:11.760 --> 17:15.160
Just because you pay a fiver a pop
down the local cattle market...

17:15.359 --> 17:19.200
...don't, for fuck's sake,
think these pills are worth millions.

17:19.400 --> 17:20.869
They're not.

17:21.069 --> 17:23.000
We've got to find a buyer.

17:23.200 --> 17:27.609
They've got to split them into parcels.
They've got to find these people.

17:27.810 --> 17:30.670
You'd give a fucking aspirin
a headache, pal.

17:30.880 --> 17:35.780
Then you've got currency fluctuations,
police activity, adverse publicity.

17:36.150 --> 17:39.740
Who has got the readies lying around
to pay for a million Es?

17:39.950 --> 17:43.580
- This is fucking bollocks!
- Slasher, shut the fuck up!

17:47.160 --> 17:50.220
- Duke, we all want a good deal.
- Mate, mate, mate.

17:50.430 --> 17:55.700
Mate, look, that parcel of pills
has got to be worth 5 million easy.

17:55.900 --> 17:58.230
- Five pound each, yeah!
- You are fucking joking.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.300
It doesn't work like that!

18:00.510 --> 18:05.170
Don't keep fucking
saying that to me!

18:05.380 --> 18:09.180
I've got some samples.
I'll stay in touch through Gene, okay?

18:10.350 --> 18:14.680
You wouldn't be so fucking flash
if you didn't have him behind you.

18:14.890 --> 18:18.410
Yeah, well, he fucking has, isn’t he?

18:21.590 --> 18:23.190
Where did these monkeys
get a million Es?

18:23.400 --> 18:26.460
Don't worry about that.
Can you place them?

18:26.670 --> 18:28.530
We know someone up north
who'll buy.

18:28.730 --> 18:32.600
Morty, set up a meeting
with Trevor and Shanks in Liverpool.

18:36.210 --> 18:39.440
What's really bothering me
is what colour to get the Aston.

18:39.650 --> 18:42.610
As you're driving it yourself,
probably green.

18:42.820 --> 18:44.510
- Green?
- Yeah.

18:44.720 --> 18:47.780
That's a trifle dull, I thought.
What do you think, girls?

18:47.990 --> 18:49.610
Black. Yeah, black.

18:49.820 --> 18:52.310
Black's the colour
for a hearse or a taxi.

18:52.530 --> 18:55.860
Don't be so conservative.
Black's a splendid idea.

18:56.060 --> 18:59.160
Hello. Look who it is.
Sit down. Do join us.

18:59.370 --> 19:03.200
- Can we have a word?
- Our dreary broker has arrived.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.660
Hugo, follow me.

19:05.870 --> 19:08.170
Don't go anywhere.
Drink some more champagne.

19:08.370 --> 19:10.670
Especially you.
I like it when you're drunk.

19:14.010 --> 19:17.680
- You're the master of that.
- What are you up to?

19:17.880 --> 19:20.380
We're doing the number
on these American birds.

19:20.590 --> 19:23.150
- Who am I today?
- The Earl of Oxford.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.850
- The Earl of Oxford.
- Fucking hell.

19:26.060 --> 19:29.520
- What's this business, then?
- It's a bit strange.

19:29.730 --> 19:32.250
Can you find somebody
for me really quickly?

19:32.470 --> 19:36.990
- How quickly?
- Twenty grand quickly.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.230
You've got our attention.

19:44.980 --> 19:48.780
Oh, very nice.
I suppose this is the boyfriend?

19:49.520 --> 19:51.570
It's a bit unusual for you.
What's going on?

19:51.780 --> 19:55.690
- It doesn't matter. Can you do it?
- Yeah.

19:56.420 --> 20:00.190
Should be a doddle.
All the same, junkies and crack heads.

20:00.390 --> 20:02.420
Chuck them a few quid,
they'll cough.

20:03.330 --> 20:05.300
- Is there anything else?
- No.

20:05.770 --> 20:07.790
We must get back to work, old boy.

20:10.740 --> 20:12.170
Look.

20:12.370 --> 20:17.070
All right, mate.
I'm the Duke's nephew.

20:17.280 --> 20:19.140
Remember me? Sidney.

20:19.350 --> 20:23.180
Sidney. Yes. Hello, mate. How are
you? I'm just off. Have a nice night.

20:23.380 --> 20:25.370
How you doing?
What you doing here?

20:25.620 --> 20:28.680
I hear you're doing business
with my uncle, the Duke.

20:28.890 --> 20:31.320
Why don't you tell
the whole fucking room?

20:35.900 --> 20:38.360
- This is Tammy.
- Who's your mate, Sidney?

20:38.560 --> 20:42.300
He's a good mate of my uncle's,
the Duke. He was just going.

20:42.500 --> 20:46.560
Yeah, well, stick around and
have a drink before you do, yeah?

20:48.640 --> 20:53.810
- Yeah, all right.
- I got VIP down here. Nice little booth.

20:59.490 --> 21:01.540
Charisma, he's fucking got it.

21:01.790 --> 21:05.190
I know he's my uncle and all that,
but you can't deny it.

21:05.390 --> 21:07.760
If you want anything, just tell me...

21:07.960 --> 21:10.220
...because I got them
straightened out in here.

21:10.430 --> 21:13.490
If you want any running about,
I'm your man...

21:41.590 --> 21:43.860
- Line?
- What?

21:44.060 --> 21:46.590
I said do you want a line?

21:46.830 --> 21:50.530
No, mate. You knock yourself out.

21:54.940 --> 21:58.270
Lovely, isn't she?
Isn't she a darling?

21:58.480 --> 22:00.100
Isn't she?

22:00.350 --> 22:03.080
Siddy, baby,
I could do with a livener.

22:08.620 --> 22:13.390
Sidney, it's been great. I'll see you,
man. Thanks for the champagne.

22:13.590 --> 22:15.620
All right.

22:32.810 --> 22:35.470
You let me know when you're happy,
Mr. Lucky.

22:35.680 --> 22:39.240
- Too warm down your way?
- We're kept busy, Trevor.

22:39.450 --> 22:41.150
Everyone wants a slice as well.

22:41.350 --> 22:44.450
Same wherever you go.
Greedy people.

22:44.660 --> 22:47.220
Yeah, it's all clear, Shanks.

22:47.430 --> 22:51.190
You lot would know all about that,
wouldn't you?

22:51.560 --> 22:53.400
What the fuck's that, Shanks?

22:53.600 --> 22:57.930
Well, not you lot, but...

22:58.140 --> 23:00.900
...that team down your end.
Like you don't know.

23:01.140 --> 23:04.010
No offence, but what the fuck
are you talking about?

23:05.440 --> 23:08.500
You really surprise me,
do you know that?

23:08.710 --> 23:11.010
Do you know something we don't?

23:11.220 --> 23:16.620
Don't be giving it
the big fucking innocent, pal.

23:16.820 --> 23:21.560
Because I am not a fucking prick.

23:21.760 --> 23:26.720
- I never said you were, Shanks.
- Cool it. They really don't know.

23:27.800 --> 23:31.400
- Explain.
- I was over in Amsterdam.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.330
Last weekend, right?

23:33.540 --> 23:36.980
The whole place is alight
with a rumour...

23:37.180 --> 23:40.340
...about how this hooligan outfit
from down your end...

23:40.550 --> 23:45.450
...run by this joker called the Duke...

23:45.650 --> 23:48.090
Gazza, go and find
them fucking pills.

23:48.290 --> 23:51.620
All right. Come on.
Have a look in here.

23:53.490 --> 23:57.720
They skanked this outfit,
a proper, nutty Serbian militia.

23:57.930 --> 24:01.920
You're the first person ever to be
foolish enough to steal from me.

24:02.130 --> 24:03.500
Shut up.

24:03.700 --> 24:05.830
But you're not the first
to point a gun at me.

24:06.040 --> 24:07.940
Shut up or I'll be the last.

24:11.310 --> 24:12.570
Fuck me.

24:12.780 --> 24:15.580
They got lucky. He'd just
knocked up a massive batch.

24:15.780 --> 24:21.050
Fucking jackpot. There's fucking
millions of the fuckers in here.

24:23.060 --> 24:25.550
Stay down there. Yes?

24:26.060 --> 24:28.220
You watch them.

24:33.730 --> 24:36.330
That looks very heavy for you,
darling.

24:36.540 --> 24:37.730
Fuck off.

24:41.670 --> 24:44.370
- Why don't you put it down?
- Why don't you shut up?

24:44.640 --> 24:49.080
- A little girl playing games with guns.
- I isn’t no little girl. Shut up!

24:54.220 --> 24:56.650
- You are shaking.
- Fuck off!

24:56.860 --> 24:58.320
- Look at your arm.
- Fuck off!

24:58.520 --> 25:01.020
- Put it down.
- Why don't you listen to me?

25:01.760 --> 25:03.730
- Sit down!
- Fuck off!

25:12.340 --> 25:14.810
Baby, baby, baby, baby!

25:15.010 --> 25:19.810
Come here. Come here.
Baby, calm down, calm down.

25:23.850 --> 25:27.910
This will not be the end of this,
Mr. Duke, believe me.

25:28.120 --> 25:32.080
Gazza, go and load them pills.

25:32.290 --> 25:36.730
But he got unlucky because this lot
are wanted for fucking war crimes.

25:36.930 --> 25:40.960
Mass murder, ethnic cleansing.
They're lunatics.

25:41.170 --> 25:43.900
They're wanted
by the United-fucking-Nations.

25:44.740 --> 25:47.870
- Think about that.
- Let's get this clear.

25:48.240 --> 25:53.640
Duke has absolutely sweet fuck-all
to do with us, understand?

25:53.850 --> 25:56.970
Everyone in Amsterdam
believes that he has.

25:57.180 --> 25:59.910
- Bandied your names about.
- What?

26:00.120 --> 26:04.350
Word on the street is they've
unleashed their top boy.

26:14.770 --> 26:17.700
His party piece, right...

26:17.900 --> 26:22.100
...is lopping people's heads off
then fetching them back to his boss.

26:22.310 --> 26:24.300
It's all about honour and respect...

26:24.510 --> 26:28.910
...with these head-banging
nationalist outfits.

26:29.110 --> 26:34.020
They can't have it getting about that
anybody has took liberties with them.

26:34.220 --> 26:38.090
But we had nothing to do with
the acquiring of said merchandise.

26:38.290 --> 26:41.230
Okay, we accept that.

26:41.430 --> 26:46.390
But with you lot up here punting
this shipment, how does it look?

26:49.500 --> 26:50.990
Bad.

26:51.970 --> 26:56.200
You do know that we're only
talking pennies an article?

26:56.410 --> 27:01.280
- Stolen goods.
- You won't want them, then.

27:03.320 --> 27:08.010
Sit down, lah. Let's not be too hasty.

27:08.220 --> 27:10.150
Me and him need to have
a little think.

27:10.520 --> 27:13.980
Don't think too long. Someone's
going to make a killing on these pills.

27:14.230 --> 27:18.720
They already have.
That's the problem, kidder.

27:22.800 --> 27:26.600
That prick Duke's made us look
a bunch of fucking amateurs.

27:26.810 --> 27:30.800
I told you he was trouble. But he
isn’t going to drag me down with him.

27:31.010 --> 27:34.280
Try Gene again.
What a fucking show-up!

27:34.980 --> 27:37.740
- He's not answering, Mort.
- Okay.

27:39.720 --> 27:41.880
Try Jimmy at home.

27:42.090 --> 27:44.350
- You sure?
- Will you fucking ring him?

27:47.230 --> 27:51.460
- Where are we going, Morty?
- Back to that boatyard.

27:51.700 --> 27:54.360
Somebody's about
to get a fucking slap.

27:54.570 --> 27:57.300
Yes, Morty. About fucking time.

28:20.960 --> 28:22.550
Paul?

28:46.350 --> 28:47.780
What a way to go.

28:48.320 --> 28:52.920
An iron burning a hole in your chest
until your heart boils.

28:53.130 --> 28:56.320
Paulie would've told him anything,
then, wouldn't he?

28:58.160 --> 29:03.600
You see, that's what happens
when you do business with loons.

29:05.440 --> 29:11.140
Clarkie, have a sniff about. Make
some phone calls, but really quietly.

29:11.340 --> 29:14.140
Find out where the Duke's holed up.

29:14.350 --> 29:17.010
We're going to need
an insurance policy.

29:17.250 --> 29:21.810
What's the idea of phoning me at
home and leaving messages, prick!

29:22.020 --> 29:26.820
- Jimmy, it was an emergency.
- Don't fucking call me Jimmy!

29:27.560 --> 29:33.020
And what's the idea of telling Duke
those pills isn’t worth shit?

29:33.270 --> 29:35.130
You don't know
the problems you've caused.

29:35.330 --> 29:39.900
And don't be leaving it to that pair
of ponces, Cody and Tiptoes...

29:40.110 --> 29:41.940
...to find that bitch Charlie.

29:42.170 --> 29:44.870
I fucking told you to do it!

29:46.210 --> 29:49.670
Are you listening?
Find a buyer for those pills.

29:49.880 --> 29:52.720
The person moving those pills
met a nasty end.

29:52.920 --> 29:54.110
I don't give a fuck!

30:22.950 --> 30:26.150
- That was quick.
- The gaff is rotten in there.

30:26.350 --> 30:29.580
- Kinky's still here, isn't he?
- Didn't Tiptoes tell you?

30:29.820 --> 30:32.810
Tell me what? Have you let him go?

30:33.030 --> 30:36.590
No, I haven't. He's in here.

30:46.440 --> 30:48.910
Kinky.

30:49.110 --> 30:51.940
I still want to be paid.

30:59.920 --> 31:05.080
So, if I'm correct, you three gear heads
are going to be clucking very soon.

31:05.290 --> 31:09.250
In fact, you're going to be climbing
the walls any minute, aren't you?

31:09.460 --> 31:11.690
But I'm prepared to do you a favour.

31:12.260 --> 31:15.030
We can do this one of two ways.

31:15.930 --> 31:19.800
We can do it the nice way,
which I think you'll prefer.

31:20.010 --> 31:22.410
Because the other way
is my friend takes you...

31:22.610 --> 31:24.770
...and puts your head
through the window!

31:26.110 --> 31:29.880
Right, so, was Charlie here
with Kinky?

31:30.080 --> 31:34.140
Yeah, she was here for a couple days.
Kinky turned up with 5 grand.

31:34.390 --> 31:37.250
- Who's giving Kinky 5 grand?
- We don't know.

31:37.460 --> 31:40.720
They kept arguing. She was saying,
"Do you think it's that easy...

31:40.930 --> 31:44.490
... taking the 5 grand?"
But she was still caning the rocks.

31:44.700 --> 31:46.290
Where is she now?

31:46.670 --> 31:49.570
Brighton. She kept begging
Kinky to go with her.

31:49.770 --> 31:53.640
The other night, I hears this noise.
I'm looking out there. It's dark.

31:53.840 --> 31:58.800
But I sees this geezer all in black.
Like something out of a kung fu film.

31:59.010 --> 32:03.350
- Pay no attention to him. He's a nutter.
- Shut the fuck up.

32:03.550 --> 32:07.480
And you, fucking tell him now.
What geezer?

32:07.690 --> 32:11.820
I don't know. I goofed out myself.

32:12.020 --> 32:14.890
The next morning,
she's gone and Kinky's dead.

32:15.090 --> 32:17.290
You're telling me
that somebody's topped Kinky?

32:17.500 --> 32:20.400
Kinky overdosed.
He always was a greedy fucker.

32:20.600 --> 32:22.360
I saw it with my own eyes, man.

32:22.570 --> 32:25.630
You smoke too much
of that fucking crack!

32:25.840 --> 32:28.330
Shut the fuck up!

32:28.540 --> 32:30.600
- You twat!
- Shut the fuck up!

32:30.810 --> 32:32.110
Get the fucking money!

32:32.340 --> 32:34.870
Morty! Morty!

32:35.080 --> 32:37.610
This is dodgy.
That kid's talking about murder.

32:37.820 --> 32:40.610
He's talking shit.
Get to Brighton and finish the job.

32:40.820 --> 32:43.850
- It all smells a bit fishy.
- I'll double your money.

32:44.060 --> 32:48.120
- All right. And 10 G for finding Kinky.
- That wasn't the fucking deal.

32:49.260 --> 32:51.420
- Yes or no?
- Yes.

32:55.870 --> 32:59.230
Hello. Ambulance, please.

32:59.470 --> 33:02.870
185 Kirby House, King's Cross.

33:04.480 --> 33:07.880
There's a dead boy.
The door's open.

33:08.080 --> 33:11.310
My name?

33:11.520 --> 33:13.140
185 Kirby House.

33:25.230 --> 33:26.560
I'm not happy.

33:32.040 --> 33:36.770
This shit is out of control.
You sort it out, or I'll sort you out.

33:37.010 --> 33:39.640
Morty, Kinky OD'd, that's all.

33:41.810 --> 33:46.940
Charlie woke up, found him cold,
freaked out, fucked off to Brighton.

33:47.150 --> 33:49.310
Cody's going to find her.

33:54.590 --> 33:57.890
Look, I'm going to freshen these teas up.
They're cold.

34:02.900 --> 34:04.370
Morty?

34:05.500 --> 34:07.230
Is that you?

34:09.510 --> 34:11.699
Where you been hiding, then, eh?

34:12.610 --> 34:16.310
Fucking hell. What you doing
down this neck of the woods?

34:17.980 --> 34:21.080
Hello, Freddie.

34:36.469 --> 34:38.830
So...

34:40.570 --> 34:45.010
...Mr. Mortimer.

34:45.210 --> 34:49.870
Here, Morty, couldn't spare us
a few quid, for old times' sake?

34:50.719 --> 34:53.050
You look well flushed, bruv.

34:56.150 --> 34:58.420
Fuck me, he's loaded.

35:02.530 --> 35:05.830
Here, couldn't make it 5,
could you...

35:06.600 --> 35:08.460
...mate?

35:08.930 --> 35:11.330
- Let's make it 10.
- Yeah.

35:11.540 --> 35:13.560
Ten's...

35:14.870 --> 35:16.340
...a nice...

35:17.880 --> 35:19.570
...round number.

35:20.550 --> 35:21.940
What's the matter?

35:39.630 --> 35:43.530
What's happening? Been away?
Yeah. Ten fucking years.

35:49.370 --> 35:51.840
Going off?
Or do you need a red light?

35:56.180 --> 35:58.580
Morty. Enough.
He's had enough.

35:58.780 --> 36:03.020
- I'll tell you when he's had enough.
- What the fuck is this?

36:10.030 --> 36:12.860
But let's forget about all that.

36:13.060 --> 36:15.790
Let's have a cup of tea, Mr. Hurst.

36:41.660 --> 36:43.460
What the fuck?

36:43.660 --> 36:47.620
I'm sorry about that.
I won't be around for a while.

36:58.110 --> 36:59.940
- It's me.
- Hey.

37:00.150 --> 37:02.440
Come on up.
I'll leave the door open.

37:29.940 --> 37:33.170
- How's your day been so far?
- Very fucking funny.

37:35.610 --> 37:38.340
Have you eaten?
I'll have a Chinky sent up.

37:38.550 --> 37:40.110
No, I'm fine, thank you.

37:41.650 --> 37:43.310
Gene, who the fuck is Freddie?

37:43.520 --> 37:47.720
He used to run with me, Morty and
Jimmy in this real kamikaze firm.

37:47.930 --> 37:51.230
In those days, we were headed up
by this guy called Crazy Larry.

37:51.430 --> 37:53.950
Yeah. Got shot, didn't he?
Bit of a lunatic.

37:54.170 --> 37:57.360
That's an understatement.
They were a spun-out bunch.

37:57.570 --> 37:59.400
Always doing loads of drugs.

38:01.810 --> 38:03.640
Not worried about
keeping a low profile.

38:03.840 --> 38:05.040
I love you.

38:05.240 --> 38:07.140
Turn over anyone
who couldn't go to the law.

38:07.350 --> 38:09.780
No fucking problem.
Boys will be boys.

38:09.980 --> 38:13.920
Until one of them, Kilburn Jerry...

38:14.820 --> 38:16.810
... shoots himself stone dead.

38:17.590 --> 38:19.650
This is a bit of a dilemma.

38:19.860 --> 38:23.420
This desperate posse can't call the law
or an ambulance.

38:23.630 --> 38:26.560
Morty, out of some mad
fucking sense of loyalty...

38:26.770 --> 38:29.290
... actually volunteered
to dispose of the body.

38:29.500 --> 38:32.630
No head.
But things went a bit wrong.

38:33.410 --> 38:38.240
The guy Larry told to help him
was Freddie Hurst.

38:38.440 --> 38:41.940
The total imbecile had fallen asleep
at some traffic lights...

38:42.150 --> 38:44.880
... in a drunken,
drug-induced stupor.

38:45.080 --> 38:50.110
Morty was still shut up in the van with
the headless body of Kilburn Jerry.

38:50.360 --> 38:53.090
Being black was even worse
than being Irish.

38:53.290 --> 38:55.520
They threw the book at Morty.

38:55.730 --> 38:57.920
Freddie got three years
for aiding and abetting.

38:58.130 --> 39:01.620
Morty did 10 years because
Freddie Hurst fell asleep?

39:01.830 --> 39:03.770
But he kept his mouth shut.

39:03.970 --> 39:07.770
Did his bird.
Earned a lot of respect for that.

39:07.970 --> 39:10.700
All because some kid
was being ridden against his will...

39:10.910 --> 39:13.740
...by a psychotic lunatic.
- Who?

39:14.350 --> 39:17.910
But you, you fuck!

39:18.550 --> 39:19.880
Larry.

39:20.090 --> 39:23.780
- Crazy Larry was gay.
- He was never gay.

39:23.990 --> 39:27.320
- Larry used to say...
- Fucking females is for puffs.

39:27.530 --> 39:29.820
So who shot Crazy Larry?
A boyfriend?

39:30.030 --> 39:31.860
Probably.

39:32.060 --> 39:37.230
Larry made enemies very easy. Took
liberties with too many straight lads.

39:39.100 --> 39:41.160
Not for me.

39:43.580 --> 39:47.200
Listen, son. Let me explain
something to you.

39:47.410 --> 39:50.850
Freddie's in intensive care
with a bit of a brain haemorrhage.

39:51.680 --> 39:56.050
You were there at the scene.
That's called joint venture.

39:56.250 --> 39:59.590
Now, if Freddie dies,
you're either in the dock with Morty...

39:59.790 --> 40:04.750
...or you're in the witness box
putting him away. Think about that.

40:09.730 --> 40:12.200
You know, I will have one of those.

40:19.080 --> 40:22.050
- All right, fellas?
- Where's Duke?

40:22.250 --> 40:24.680
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?

40:24.880 --> 40:29.320
- I don't know. I thought he was here.
- Well, go and fucking find him.

40:30.050 --> 40:34.790
He's probably having a night out
while us mugs baby-sit these.

40:36.560 --> 40:40.930
Gene, what the fuck
am I going to do about these Serbs?

40:44.700 --> 40:47.670
Come here.
I have something for you.

40:55.980 --> 40:58.880
- You're going to need one of these.
- Fuck me, Gene.

41:00.050 --> 41:04.820
I fucking hope not. Are you trying
to scare the shit out of me?

41:05.020 --> 41:07.720
I mean, I fucking hate guns.

41:07.930 --> 41:11.260
Although that one is really pretty.
Is that Second World War?

41:11.460 --> 41:14.090
Hey, point it upwards.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.330
Oh, for fuck's sake.

41:20.640 --> 41:23.160
Here, let me see if it's loaded.

41:40.860 --> 41:43.290
You look like
you could do that blindfolded.

41:43.500 --> 41:46.790
I can, and I do.

41:47.000 --> 41:52.660
I find it very relaxing.
Good for meditation.

41:53.870 --> 41:58.830
Meditation is concentrating the front
of the mind with a mundane task...

41:59.040 --> 42:02.710
...so the rest of the mind can find
peace.

42:06.620 --> 42:09.310
And you find peace with guns.

42:10.090 --> 42:13.680
Well, on occasion.
It has been known.

42:15.930 --> 42:19.660
Listen. I know it's not your thing.

42:21.670 --> 42:27.070
But if you ever have to kill somebody,
never ever tell a living soul.

42:46.460 --> 42:49.820
- Who is this?
- My name is Dragan.

42:53.030 --> 42:55.090
How did you get this number?

42:55.300 --> 42:59.600
Boatman Paul gave me your number,
in the end.

42:59.800 --> 43:03.430
I believe you have some property
that belongs to my employer...

43:03.680 --> 43:07.410
... and you're the person I should talk
to about the return of this cargo...

43:07.610 --> 43:10.710
... stolen by your associate,
the Duke.

43:11.680 --> 43:14.450
Dragan, the Duke
is nothing to do with me.

43:14.690 --> 43:17.420
Mr. Duke came to Amsterdam,
used your name...

43:17.620 --> 43:19.720
... said he worked for you.

43:22.760 --> 43:26.390
- Are you listening?
- Dragan...

43:30.070 --> 43:34.700
...I’ve got an idea. Why don't
you come round for breakfast?

43:34.910 --> 43:38.470
I'll squeeze some orange juice,
and we'll talk about this like adults.

43:38.680 --> 43:42.110
- How does that sound?
- Sounds very hospitable.

43:42.310 --> 43:44.040
- Do you know where I live?
- No.

43:44.250 --> 43:45.940
Well, fuck off, then.

43:57.200 --> 44:00.390
Duke's gone missing.
He's a fucking liability.

44:00.600 --> 44:03.690
The pigs are everywhere.
This was meant to be easy. No sweat.

44:03.900 --> 44:07.500
Calm down, Gazza.
I'm sure Duke's just fine.

44:07.710 --> 44:11.640
You've got 48 hours to find a buyer
or I'm sending them back, okay?

44:11.840 --> 44:14.900
Now, listen.
Don't do anything stupid, Gazza.

44:15.110 --> 44:18.210
It isn’t worth the grief. We've gone
underground, off the radar.

44:18.420 --> 44:20.880
Nothing personal,
but I don't trust you.

44:35.730 --> 44:38.900
Listen, I just had a phone call
from Gazza.

44:39.100 --> 44:43.940
Being a cry-baby. Threatening
to offload those pills in 48 hours.

44:44.140 --> 44:46.110
Between you and
that gobshite Duke...

44:46.310 --> 44:48.340
...he's promised Jimmy
a bumper payday.

44:48.550 --> 44:51.140
- So get busy.
- I said to Jimmy I'd try and...

44:51.350 --> 44:53.210
He put yous together.

44:53.420 --> 44:56.440
You and Duke. That's his job.

44:56.650 --> 45:02.350
If you two can't make music, he's
going to want his whack out either way.

45:10.000 --> 45:11.830
That's business.

45:18.380 --> 45:22.210
- I hope you put this Dragan straight.
- Yeah. I told him to fuck off.

45:22.410 --> 45:25.440
What? Please tell me
you're fucking joking.

45:25.650 --> 45:28.680
Well, I am beginning
to regret it now.

45:30.020 --> 45:33.390
We've got to find the Duke,
find these fucking pills.

45:33.590 --> 45:36.030
We can't rely on these monkeys
to call Gene.

45:36.230 --> 45:39.030
We've looked everywhere.
There's no sign.

45:39.230 --> 45:41.200
You can't find any of his firm?

45:41.400 --> 45:43.830
Maybe this Dragan geezer's
already found the Duke...

45:44.040 --> 45:46.500
...and done the business.

45:46.700 --> 45:49.870
Yeah, well, there is someone
I can call. Keep looking.

45:50.070 --> 45:53.240
Wait. You're going to leave it to us?

45:53.480 --> 45:56.850
This Dragan geezer is phoning me.
I am the target.

45:57.050 --> 46:02.250
And if we don't find the Duke,
this, everything, all over.

46:09.690 --> 46:12.750
- It's me. Sidney's mate.
- Oh, hiya.

46:12.960 --> 46:16.400
- What took you so long to call?
- I've been busy.

46:16.600 --> 46:19.590
- You sound sleepy. Just woken up?
- Not long ago.

46:19.800 --> 46:24.300
- So when am I going to see you?
- What are you doing now?

46:24.510 --> 46:29.610
Nothing. No, I was just lying in bed,
wondering what to do.

46:32.720 --> 46:35.080
- You still in bed?
- Yeah.

46:39.760 --> 46:40.950
You lying there naked?

46:41.160 --> 46:45.490
I've got a little T-shirt on.
But that's all.

46:45.700 --> 46:47.990
Here, wait, listen to this.

46:51.300 --> 46:52.790
What's that?

46:53.000 --> 46:56.340
I was just rubbing the phone
against my fanny.

46:56.540 --> 47:00.530
Did you like it?
My, oh, my, it's fresh this morning.

47:00.750 --> 47:07.280
Look at my nipples, standing up like
little soldiers. What is a girl to do?

47:07.490 --> 47:11.110
Tammy, why don't we meet up now?

47:11.320 --> 47:13.520
I'll book a table for lunch.
St. Martin's Hotel.

47:13.720 --> 47:17.250
Don't worry about a table.
We'll have room service.

47:17.460 --> 47:19.550
- Yeah, okay.
- One hour.

47:55.600 --> 47:57.730
Hang on.

48:32.670 --> 48:35.070
Oh, shit.

48:37.910 --> 48:41.000
Oh, leave it off, Sidney.
He's driving me fucking mad.

48:46.650 --> 48:51.210
- We're not expecting Sidney, are we?
- He's too busy kissing Duke's arse.

48:51.420 --> 48:52.950
Not round here, I hope.

48:53.160 --> 48:57.650
No, over by Greenwich market. So
you can relax. It's just the two of us.

49:06.800 --> 49:10.710
Patience. All good things
come to those who wait.

49:13.740 --> 49:15.140
Stay put.

49:33.030 --> 49:34.000
Come on.

49:35.830 --> 49:40.170
Hello, it's me. It's me.
Shut up and listen.

49:40.400 --> 49:44.530
Duke's nephew is working down by
Greenwich Market. Go and look.

49:46.480 --> 49:49.710
- Room service.
- Look for that yellow Range Rover.

49:51.050 --> 49:52.350
Okay.

49:59.390 --> 50:01.620
- Your champagne, sir.
- I didn't order...

50:28.850 --> 50:30.290
One moment, Mr. Troop.

50:30.490 --> 50:33.580
I want to hear what this bastard
has to say for himself.

50:46.940 --> 50:49.910
I'm Jimmy's old colleague,
Eddie Temple.

50:51.280 --> 50:53.770
- Fuck!
- He told you to locate my daughter.

50:53.980 --> 50:56.410
Hunt her down
like some lost mongrel.

50:58.450 --> 51:00.940
He said you asked for his help.

51:01.150 --> 51:07.610
Mr. Troop could find anyone
on the planet in 10 minutes flat.

51:07.830 --> 51:13.630
If you'd laid a finger on my daughter,
you'd be over the edge like that.

51:13.830 --> 51:15.800
You'd join that shit, Kinky...

51:16.000 --> 51:19.270
...who thought he could take
my 5 grand and fuck me over.

51:19.700 --> 51:25.070
The audacity.
How fucking dare you?

51:25.280 --> 51:28.800
I've known Jimmy Price for 45 years.

51:29.010 --> 51:31.710
It pays me to keep an eye on him.

51:33.850 --> 51:36.410
Do you know what a remora fish is?

51:38.220 --> 51:40.710
- Yes.
- Oh, you do?

51:41.960 --> 51:46.450
Well, Jimmy has been swimming
in my slipstream all my fucking life.

51:46.760 --> 51:50.670
I thought he might put some
volatile psychopath on the job.

51:50.870 --> 51:54.170
But I've checked you out, son.
You're a smart boy.

51:54.370 --> 51:57.670
But you keep
very, very bad company.

52:00.780 --> 52:04.440
You know, I host a charity
golf tournament every year.

52:04.650 --> 52:07.780
Quite an event in the social calendar,
if I do say so myself.

52:07.990 --> 52:13.450
I like to invite Jimmy. Some of my
friends find him absurdly hilarious.

52:13.760 --> 52:16.560
Drinks are on me.
Drinks for everyone.

52:16.760 --> 52:19.630
Champagne.
Fucking good gear and all.

52:19.830 --> 52:25.830
But I've come unstuck in my attempts
to provide a spectacle for my chums.

52:26.040 --> 52:29.060
Jimmy, as usual
on the lookout for tidbits...

52:29.270 --> 52:33.470
... has met the development minister
of some tin-pot republic.

52:33.680 --> 52:36.340
They're trawling the West
for investments.

52:36.550 --> 52:41.510
They have vast natural resources.
Quite an investment for the right man.

52:41.750 --> 52:45.450
They've sent in men from Timbuktu
explaining all the details.

52:45.660 --> 52:50.820
Profits, shares, long-term
investments, short-term investments.

52:51.030 --> 52:53.550
They've even made him
an honorary citizen.

52:53.760 --> 52:57.330
Even made him one of the tribe.

52:57.700 --> 53:01.660
What we didn't know,
until it all ended in tears...

53:01.870 --> 53:04.860
...was that the hard-line
communist insurgents...

53:05.080 --> 53:08.240
... who control the country
outside the mining areas...

53:08.450 --> 53:12.970
Bad news about our little venture, Jim.
The communists have broken through.

53:13.180 --> 53:15.580
Heading for the capital
with little resistance.

53:15.790 --> 53:17.910
What the fuck are you on about?

53:18.120 --> 53:20.320
I got word they were
planning a push.

53:20.560 --> 53:22.720
The final coup de grâce.
I told Jimmy.

53:22.930 --> 53:24.760
- It's all over.
- Fuck's sake!

53:24.960 --> 53:28.630
- Keep your voice down.
- Get my money out quick, now.

53:28.870 --> 53:32.390
As if it was some little kiddie's
piggy bank.

53:32.600 --> 53:37.100
I explained that wasn't possible. We
thought we'd bought a government.

53:37.310 --> 53:39.970
Maybe someone made a better offer.
Forget about it.

53:40.180 --> 53:41.770
You win some, you lose some.

53:42.550 --> 53:44.210
How much are we talking?

53:44.420 --> 53:46.210
It's only a cheeky half-mil, Jim.

53:46.420 --> 53:49.880
- It's much more than that.
- How much?

53:50.090 --> 53:53.250
- Thirteen.
- Thirteen what?

53:53.460 --> 53:59.520
- Thirteen million pounds. I'm fucked.
- Have you gone fucking mad?

53:59.730 --> 54:04.130
Thirteen million pounds!

54:04.340 --> 54:07.860
How could you be
so fucking stupid?

54:08.110 --> 54:10.570
You've been right grafted,
royally turned over.

54:10.770 --> 54:12.900
Like some Yank buying
London Bridge.

54:13.110 --> 54:14.700
Don't talk to me like that.

54:14.950 --> 54:16.850
He accused me of instigating it.

54:17.080 --> 54:19.550
It's no coincidence
I met them at your tournament.

54:19.750 --> 54:21.650
Are you fucking demented?

54:21.850 --> 54:24.080
Asked me to fly to Zurich
to see the minister...

54:24.290 --> 54:27.920
...still parked up in La Maison Grande,
still eating well.

54:28.130 --> 54:33.090
Big fat fucker.
On little Jimmy's nest egg.

54:33.300 --> 54:35.290
Jimmy thought he'd keep
Charlotte hostage...

54:35.500 --> 54:37.330
...while you went to get his money.

54:37.530 --> 54:42.530
Little Jimmy was so stupid,
he thought he couldn't lose either way.

54:42.740 --> 54:43.930
I'm sorry, what?

54:44.140 --> 54:47.240
If you find Charlotte,
he's got his hostage.

54:47.440 --> 54:51.900
If I find you trying to find her,
I do his dirty work.

54:53.650 --> 54:57.280
- I'm still not with you.
- Your lives are inextricably linked.

54:58.190 --> 55:02.250
I've found out something
very interesting about Jimmy...

55:02.460 --> 55:04.220
...something I've long suspected.

55:06.760 --> 55:11.170
But I'll let Jimmy explain.

55:11.370 --> 55:13.800
You follow me.

56:02.520 --> 56:03.710
You've no doubt suffered...

56:03.920 --> 56:07.720
...Jimmy's "CID was geezers you
was at school with" routine?

56:07.930 --> 56:09.590
The other chap's Albert Carter.

56:09.790 --> 56:12.690
Another twisted bastard
from the old neighbourhood.

56:12.900 --> 56:17.230
Member of the Regional Crime Squad.
Sit back, relax, enjoy.

56:17.430 --> 56:20.100
It isn’t like your lot in the old days.

56:20.300 --> 56:23.100
- They've all gone squeaky.
- Tell me about it, Jim.

56:23.310 --> 56:27.180
I have to box clever with those
college boys from Anti-Corruption.

56:27.410 --> 56:33.010
- Fucking dogs. Slags. Ten grand?
- That's the going rate, Jim.

56:33.750 --> 56:36.450
Ten K. Hardly seems
worth the bother.

56:36.650 --> 56:42.290
Well, there's only so much
in those informer funds.

56:45.560 --> 56:48.760
What about Gene?
Does he suspect anything?

56:48.970 --> 56:53.730
What? About me working
for the old firm? Listen. Gene...

56:53.940 --> 56:56.170
...is too loyal for his own good.

56:58.180 --> 57:01.170
- I don't fucking believe it.
- You better believe it.

57:01.380 --> 57:04.840
- Because it's fucking happening.
- Where did you get this?

57:05.420 --> 57:07.210
Mr. Troop made it for me.

57:08.320 --> 57:12.690
- It's one of his little hobbies.
- I don't fucking believe it.

57:12.890 --> 57:16.550
Don't you want to hear
what Jimmy has to say about you?

57:16.760 --> 57:22.030
I've got one for you.
Plucked and ready for the pot.

57:22.530 --> 57:25.800
- Just give us a name, and he's gone.
- In time.

57:26.000 --> 57:28.840
I don't want a bounce.
I want him out of the way.

57:29.040 --> 57:32.910
Flash young runt.
One of the new breed, isn’t he?

57:33.110 --> 57:37.170
Reckons he can just waltz off
into retirement.

57:37.380 --> 57:40.080
I want him away for 12.

57:40.280 --> 57:43.740
If he's got a kilo of class A,
he's looking at double figures.

57:43.950 --> 57:46.650
- I'll put it there myself.
- Sounds personal.

57:46.860 --> 57:49.830
He's got a few quid.
He'll come in handy.

57:50.030 --> 57:54.160
I set him up with that slippery
accountant in the first place.

57:54.360 --> 57:56.760
Fucking rag-head let slip, didn't he?

57:57.070 --> 58:01.300
"You will miss him when he's gone,
Mr. Price. "

58:01.510 --> 58:06.370
Is that you, the flash runt
who thinks he's retiring?

58:06.580 --> 58:09.770
You'd no idea what
Jimmy was up to?

58:09.980 --> 58:12.510
How do you think these fuckers
earn a living?

58:12.720 --> 58:17.020
I would've thought a smart young man
like you would know that already.

58:17.220 --> 58:20.750
- Can I have that?
- Mr. Troop.

58:23.530 --> 58:25.550
Thank you.

58:27.870 --> 58:31.820
This looks like you, son.
Smart part of town.

58:32.040 --> 58:35.840
I'll keep an eye open. Must dash off.
Get home. Wash and brush up.

58:36.040 --> 58:39.010
Opera tonight.
The Damnation of Faust.

58:39.210 --> 58:42.300
Man sells his soul to the devil.
All ends in tears.

58:42.510 --> 58:44.170
These arrangements usually do.

58:54.490 --> 58:57.020
One more thing, young man.

58:57.230 --> 59:01.060
Always remember, the art of good
business is being a good middleman.

59:01.270 --> 59:03.320
Bye-bye.

59:32.860 --> 59:34.520
Fuck!

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:02.890
- I've got him.
- Got who?

01:05:03.460 --> 01:05:06.160
Sidney, remember?
Yellow Range Rover?

01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:09.260
Seems they sent our friend out
for something to eat.

01:05:09.470 --> 01:05:12.300
Good. Tell Morty.

01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.990
- So, what do we do now?
- Call Morty.

01:06:33.050 --> 01:06:36.540
Shut up and listen.
No more insults, no more games.

01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:39.850
If I do not get my cargo back,
you're a dead man.

01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:45.220
Dragan, I've been doing
some checking.

01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:47.520
- I've found out who you represent.
- Good.

01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:50.460
I can point you towards
your boss's merchandise.

01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:52.570
- Come to my hotel...
- Look...

01:06:52.770 --> 01:06:55.600
...I’d rather meet you
in a public place.

01:06:55.810 --> 01:06:59.940
You have nothing to fear.
I'm a reasonable man.

01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:02.840
That's not what I've heard.

01:07:03.080 --> 01:07:05.410
I'll meet you at...

01:07:07.850 --> 01:07:11.480
I'll meet you
at Greenwich Park Observatory.

01:07:11.690 --> 01:07:14.490
- Any taxi will drop you off.
- I can read a map.

01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:18.590
- Tomorrow. Midday.
- Tomorrow at 12.

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:21.700
I'll be there.

01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:28.760
That's rude, Mr. Dragan.

01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:42.620
Condition's red down there, pal.

01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:47.020
They're didgy as fuck.
They haven't moved from that lockup.

01:07:47.220 --> 01:07:50.120
Have a look at the geezer
at the front, on the door.

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.100
I know him from somewhere.
This could get messy.

01:07:56.300 --> 01:07:58.390
What about the blokes in red?

01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:00.830
Mechanics.
They got a ringing coup going on.

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.900
The lorries come in one colour,
go out another.

01:08:04.170 --> 01:08:06.400
But they're nothing to do
with the Duke.

01:08:06.610 --> 01:08:09.130
- Fuck me, look who it isn't.
- Who's that?

01:08:10.410 --> 01:08:13.870
It doesn't matter. I've got work to do.

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:17.319
- Stay here. Those pills move, call me.
- You got it.

01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:20.750
- Day and night, Terry.
- What do you mean "night"?

01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:24.920
- I've been here all day. Get Clarkie.
- Day and fucking night. Got it?

01:08:46.550 --> 01:08:50.920
Hello, young man. Thank you
for coming at such short notice.

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:55.290
I hope you didn't feel too summoned.
How are you?

01:08:55.490 --> 01:08:59.620
I'm in the best of health, Mr. Temple.
Thank you for asking.

01:09:00.300 --> 01:09:02.819
- How are you keeping?
- I'm very well.

01:09:03.029 --> 01:09:06.260
- How was the performance of Faust?
- Complex.

01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:09.529
No wonder it took him
60 years to write it.

01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:11.729
How's the family?

01:09:11.939 --> 01:09:13.910
What is this? A vicar's tea party?

01:09:14.109 --> 01:09:17.270
You do sometimes take
your conversations away with you.

01:09:17.479 --> 01:09:19.680
Being a clever bastard, are we?

01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:23.750
- How do I know you're not wired up?
- Well, I'm not.

01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:27.680
Then we'll have to trust each other,
won't we? Sit down.

01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:37.200
I've been thinking, after
our chat the other day.

01:09:37.399 --> 01:09:40.859
Your pills. How much for the lot?

01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:45.170
No, I've already got a buyer.

01:09:45.380 --> 01:09:48.109
Nearly took my hand off.
He's putting the money together now.

01:09:48.310 --> 01:09:51.080
I told you, lah. I'm still thinking.

01:09:51.279 --> 01:09:54.580
It's only been three days.
What's the fucking hurry?

01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:57.450
- What's he paying?
- It's confidential.

01:09:57.650 --> 01:10:00.150
Don't be an idiot.
Let me match his offer.

01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:03.220
They've got history.

01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:05.620
Bad juju.

01:10:05.830 --> 01:10:09.990
And, anyway, this Serbian maniac's
in hot pursuit.

01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:15.370
If I sold them to you, I'd have to
disappoint him. And he is definitely...

01:10:15.570 --> 01:10:20.840
I did you a big fucking favour
letting you know about Jimmy.

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:23.440
I think you owe me.

01:10:25.050 --> 01:10:28.680
Two and a half million in sterling and
euros, high-denomination used notes.

01:10:28.890 --> 01:10:33.190
So if I gave you 3 million,
that would keep everyone happy.

01:10:33.390 --> 01:10:35.450
Let me state my position.

01:10:36.390 --> 01:10:38.860
You can sell these pills
to whoever you like.

01:10:39.060 --> 01:10:42.460
That's your privilege.
That's your business.

01:10:42.670 --> 01:10:44.930
But I'll tell you...

01:10:45.130 --> 01:10:50.370
...I’ll be very, very unhappy
if you don't sell them to me.

01:10:50.570 --> 01:10:52.770
You understand?

01:10:57.550 --> 01:11:00.880
Okay, Mr. Temple.
Three million. Done.

01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:06.250
- My buyer's not going to be happy.
- Fuck him. He'll get over it.

01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:17.790
I'm going to need some help.

01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:23.070
Someone who can eliminate the
problem. Someone who's a bit handy.

01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:26.140
Whoa! Slow down, kidder.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:31.000
Mr. Lucky does a drop
of freelance work.

01:11:31.810 --> 01:11:35.440
I don't need to know.
It's none of my business.

01:11:36.190 --> 01:11:39.750
You tell him when,
and he'll come down on the train.

01:11:41.820 --> 01:11:43.990
Thanks, Trev.

01:11:44.460 --> 01:11:46.290
Excuse me.

01:11:51.100 --> 01:11:52.330
Mr. Temple.

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:57.200
You deliver them to my warehouse.
When do I get my consignment?

01:11:57.410 --> 01:11:59.840
Monday. No, Tuesday, probably.

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:02.530
Tuesday? I'm paying
over the odds, remember?

01:12:02.750 --> 01:12:06.610
England! Typical. Even drug dealers
don't work weekends.

01:12:20.360 --> 01:12:22.830
That's good news.
That should cheer Gene up.

01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:27.230
Yeah, everything's under control.

01:12:30.710 --> 01:12:34.670
- Cody's been chasing his 10 grand.
- Yeah. I'll call him later.

01:12:40.020 --> 01:12:42.640
- Hey, Geno, what's up?
- Got some good news.

01:12:42.850 --> 01:12:44.510
Oh, yeah? What's that?

01:12:45.120 --> 01:12:47.850
- You murdering bastard!
- Open the fucking door!

01:12:48.060 --> 01:12:51.650
- Stay out of this, Morty.
- Gene!

01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:56.320
- Murder? Who's dead?
- Jimmy.

01:12:56.530 --> 01:12:59.870
He killed him.
Blew his fucking head away.

01:13:00.070 --> 01:13:02.370
- Open the fucking door!
- Why?

01:13:03.940 --> 01:13:06.410
Open the fucking door!

01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:14.610
- Get off him.
- No, listen, listen. Just listen.

01:13:14.820 --> 01:13:20.550
Listen to me, Morty. I got a call
from a cozzer we've got bent.

01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:23.190
They found Jimmy's body last night.

01:13:23.390 --> 01:13:26.190
In his own backyard.
It was this sly bastard.

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.860
He's no killer.
Somebody's made a mistake.

01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:31.930
All right, look. Here. We'll see.

01:13:32.140 --> 01:13:33.800
Read it. Read it out loud.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:38.130
"To senior ranks only. Murder Squad
investigation. James Lionel Price."

01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:40.940
Read the fucking ballistics report.

01:13:41.140 --> 01:13:45.140
"Preliminary ballistics report. No arms
recovered. Disintegrated on impact.

01:13:45.350 --> 01:13:47.110
One recovered cartridge casing."

01:13:47.320 --> 01:13:51.550
You forgot to take the cartridge case.
You got sloppy.

01:13:51.750 --> 01:13:53.780
"...consistent with weapon used...

01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:59.430
...in unsolved homicide of Lawrence
Gower a.k.a. Crazy Larry Flynn."

01:13:59.630 --> 01:14:04.530
Wait. I got it. Whoever killed
Crazy Larry must've killed Jimmy.

01:14:04.730 --> 01:14:08.760
No, no. The gun.
The fucking gun was the same.

01:14:08.970 --> 01:14:11.670
The one he stole from my flat.

01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:16.500
- You killed Crazy Larry?
- So?

01:14:16.710 --> 01:14:20.440
- This fucker killed Jimmy.
- Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:29.180
- Why did you do it?
- He was an informer.

01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:30.880
He was a police informer!

01:14:31.090 --> 01:14:34.390
Jimmy a grass?
Are you fucking mad?

01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:38.160
- You'll have to do better than that.
- I've got a recording at home.

01:14:38.370 --> 01:14:41.860
Of Jimmy and a cozzer
called Albie Carter.

01:14:42.070 --> 01:14:47.340
Gene, let's listen to this shit.

01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:51.540
If he's lying,
we'll both fucking kill him.

01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:53.770
Mr. Mortimer reckons...

01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:59.650
... the Tylers are bringing in shooters
from Jamaica via Manchester.

01:14:59.860 --> 01:15:03.290
They got someone in Immigration
straightened out.

01:15:03.490 --> 01:15:07.590
I don't think anybody gives a fuck
about spades shooting spades.

01:15:07.800 --> 01:15:12.630
Don't you care
about dead darkies, Albert?

01:15:13.170 --> 01:15:16.760
What about Gene?
Does he suspect anything?

01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:20.000
What? About me
working for the old firm?

01:15:22.310 --> 01:15:24.400
Convinced?

01:15:28.850 --> 01:15:31.150
You don't fuck about, do you?

01:15:37.290 --> 01:15:40.320
Jimmy was skint, huh?

01:15:40.530 --> 01:15:43.860
That's why he set up the whole
Amsterdam business with Duke.

01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:52.440
I really think we should keep
all of this to ourselves, right?

01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.670
Really?

01:15:57.250 --> 01:15:59.440
Why did you kill Larry?

01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:05.390
Funny enough,
it was Jimmy who persuaded me.

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:08.290
Jimmy never liked Larry.

01:16:08.490 --> 01:16:12.050
Look at that wrong one waving
his money around. It isn’t right.

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.560
Hey, I love you, man.

01:16:15.770 --> 01:16:21.290
He saw the future was drugs and
it needed to be run like a business.

01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:23.730
Crazy Larry
was no fucking businessman.

01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:26.500
After that business
with Kilburn Jerry...

01:16:26.710 --> 01:16:30.940
That's it, son. You do him. Bollocks!

01:16:31.150 --> 01:16:33.710
...he wanted him gone.

01:16:36.650 --> 01:16:39.640
I didn't have any problem
doing him.

01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:46.320
That's why I did it.

01:16:46.530 --> 01:16:48.830
But why did you keep the gun?

01:16:49.030 --> 01:16:52.760
Sounds silly now,
but it was me favourite.

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:57.340
I hope you don't tell the other guns
you've got favourites.

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:05.840
So, what's the next move, boss?

01:17:09.950 --> 01:17:12.320
Well, I'm going to bed.

01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:16.580
I don't know what you two are doing.
We can talk about it tomorrow.

01:17:49.860 --> 01:17:51.760
Sorry?

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:58.600
Sorry, mate, what was that?

01:17:58.800 --> 01:18:01.960
Would you pack that in?
I've got a fucking test next week.

01:18:02.170 --> 01:18:05.140
Okay. Okay, I'm sorry.
I was just saying...

01:18:20.260 --> 01:18:22.950
So when does the target
get here, then?

01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.690
The target? The target's going to
be here at exactly midday.

01:18:26.900 --> 01:18:29.390
- Where?
- Here, right fucking here.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:30.590
Got a photo?

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:32.600
- Don't worry about it.
- Who's worried?

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:35.930
I'll have some binoculars.
I'll give you a little signal.

01:18:36.140 --> 01:18:39.470
I could get the 10 past 1
home from here.

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:41.510
Let's have a little recce.

01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:45.850
After we do the business,
walk slowly back.

01:18:46.050 --> 01:18:48.780
Remember, it's a stroll in the park.

01:18:48.980 --> 01:18:51.110
Don't run, whatever you do.

01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:54.650
The first 5 minutes,
nobody will have a clue what's going on.

01:18:54.860 --> 01:18:57.880
Hopefully, it'll be mayhem.

01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:04.760
So try to stay relaxed.

01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:09.190
Don't do anything
to draw attention to yourself.

01:19:09.410 --> 01:19:11.310
Or me.

01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:15.970
Afterwards, take me to
the Underground station.

01:19:16.180 --> 01:19:17.510
I'll look after myself.

01:19:21.350 --> 01:19:22.720
There.

01:19:24.850 --> 01:19:26.910
Time?

01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:31.230
Six minutes to 12.

01:19:34.600 --> 01:19:36.620
I hope he's not going to be late.

01:19:40.300 --> 01:19:43.600
- Maybe he'll be early.
- That'd be nice.

01:19:55.150 --> 01:19:57.590
Can you see that guy on the left?

01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:08.260
- Big fella, marching up the hill.
- That's our man.

01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:14.700
- Are you sure?
- For fuck's sake. I'm going to call him.

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:18.370
It's up to you. You're the client.

01:20:25.250 --> 01:20:27.480
As soon as he answers,
he's gone, okay?

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:29.280
Okey-dokey.

01:20:33.620 --> 01:20:35.150
Stand by.

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:41.060
Now.

01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:46.460
Hello, may I help you?

01:20:48.140 --> 01:20:53.130
Don't move a muscle.

01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:57.710
- Do I have your attention?
- Yes.

01:20:57.910 --> 01:21:03.370
You English, you have no idea
of honour and respect.

01:21:03.590 --> 01:21:09.680
I usually kill for less.
I want my cargo and the Duke.

01:21:09.930 --> 01:21:12.990
I haven't got your pills.
Just give me a day.

01:21:15.230 --> 01:21:18.760
Don't piss in my pocket
and tell me it's raining.

01:21:18.970 --> 01:21:20.700
Now listen for the last time.

01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:25.670
- You'll bring me what is mine.
- Look, I don't... Jesus!

01:21:25.880 --> 01:21:29.680
You have one more day.

01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:32.810
See you tomorrow at dusk
by the statue.

01:21:33.020 --> 01:21:36.970
Remember, I will be watching you.

01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:48.020
What the fuck were you thinking?

01:21:50.070 --> 01:21:53.590
Getting Trevor's man down here
to shoot this Serb in a park!

01:21:54.570 --> 01:21:58.370
Trevor's going to go ballistic.
Now, what the fuck do I tell him?

01:21:58.570 --> 01:22:00.910
- What a fucking mess.
- You've gone mad.

01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:02.940
- Think you're a gangster?
- Fuck off!

01:22:03.150 --> 01:22:05.440
You want to play?
You do it somewhere else.

01:22:05.650 --> 01:22:09.080
If you do it near me,
I'll put you in a fucking wheelchair.

01:22:10.150 --> 01:22:12.210
Stick to your fucking sums.

01:22:12.890 --> 01:22:15.450
Listen. Listen to me.

01:22:15.660 --> 01:22:17.920
Dragan's killed Paul.
He's done the Duke.

01:22:18.130 --> 01:22:21.720
He's just put a bullet
between Lucky's eyes. I was there!

01:22:21.930 --> 01:22:24.420
He's watching our every move.
Who's next, me?

01:22:24.630 --> 01:22:28.930
- I wish.
- Fuck off! Could be you or Morty.

01:22:31.870 --> 01:22:35.830
Dragan said he wanted the pills
and the Duke. Where's the Duke?

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:42.320
What?

01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:47.780
I should've told you this earlier.

01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:51.760
Duke and Slasher
came by the office the other day.

01:22:51.960 --> 01:22:54.430
Paul the boatman was topped
last night.

01:22:54.630 --> 01:22:57.120
I've got to get on my toes sharpish.

01:22:57.330 --> 01:22:59.960
I want Jimmy brought here
right now, yeah?

01:23:00.170 --> 01:23:04.660
Getting that smug yuppie bastard to
tell Duke those pills were useless...

01:23:04.870 --> 01:23:07.140
...after sending us over
in the first place.

01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:09.280
Hang on, you've lost me now.

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:14.110
If you have us over, I swear by fucking
almighty God, I'll call the fucking law.

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:16.980
- What are you talking about?
- I'll call the law.

01:23:17.190 --> 01:23:19.180
She didn't mean that. She's upset.

01:23:19.390 --> 01:23:22.220
Shut the fuck up!

01:23:40.480 --> 01:23:43.270
That's where playing
at being a gangster gets you.

01:23:43.510 --> 01:23:46.310
You're not in there
because I like you.

01:23:48.850 --> 01:23:51.180
I'm beginning to feel left out.

01:23:51.390 --> 01:23:52.910
Why?

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:55.680
Freddie Hurst is still
in intensive care...

01:23:55.890 --> 01:23:59.520
...after your jolly little reunion
the other day.

01:23:59.730 --> 01:24:01.960
Fucking hell, Duke.

01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:04.660
For once, you might be of some use.

01:24:21.850 --> 01:24:25.510
That was Gazza on the phone.
It's on.

01:24:25.720 --> 01:24:29.420
He'll pick you up at 9 in the
morning. Gallows Corner. Know it?

01:24:29.630 --> 01:24:30.990
Yeah.

01:24:32.230 --> 01:24:35.530
With Jimmy gone, these pills
will make a nice contribution...

01:24:35.730 --> 01:24:40.030
...to my retirement fund,
so don't fuck things up again, okay?

01:24:40.240 --> 01:24:42.000
If you do...

01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:46.570
...you'll wish this Dragan had shot you
between the eyes, understand?

01:24:47.740 --> 01:24:49.800
Best of luck.

01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:53.310
Thanks.

01:25:15.870 --> 01:25:17.200
Fuck off!

01:25:17.410 --> 01:25:20.930
Sidney, I've told you,
stop answering my phone, okay?

01:25:21.140 --> 01:25:23.080
- Who was it?
- Wrong number.

01:26:01.620 --> 01:26:03.240
- What's up, mate?
- Hello, Sidney.

01:26:03.450 --> 01:26:06.820
- How you doing, then?
- I'm all right. How are you?

01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:08.680
I'm all right, mate, yeah.

01:26:38.150 --> 01:26:43.090
Gazza, this place stinks. We want to
get you out of here. Fifty pence a pill.

01:26:43.290 --> 01:26:45.520
That way, we all come out
with something.

01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:51.100
- I think they're worth more than that.
- This is a reality check.

01:26:51.300 --> 01:26:55.200
Paul's dead, Jimmy's dead. Duke and
Slasher, fuck knows where they are.

01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:58.310
This gear is knock-off,
and the Serbs you nicked it from...

01:26:58.510 --> 01:27:01.100
...they'd kill you like
you'd take a piss.

01:27:03.550 --> 01:27:06.170
Gazza, the old bill are outside!

01:27:07.320 --> 01:27:09.380
- Gazza, no!
- Go, go, go!

01:27:10.420 --> 01:27:12.680
- Let's have it!
- Don't point that gun at me.

01:27:12.890 --> 01:27:15.050
- Put it down!
- We're going in!

01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:19.020
Gazza, look at me. Put it down.
You're going to get us all shot.

01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:22.220
Fuck it! Boat!

01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:45.220
Stay there!

01:27:56.570 --> 01:27:58.530
Fuck!

01:28:04.210 --> 01:28:05.870
Come on!

01:28:14.350 --> 01:28:17.720
- Gazza, wait!
- Fucking hurry up, then!

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:19.550
Get in.

01:29:09.440 --> 01:29:11.240
Is this for me?

01:29:14.780 --> 01:29:16.900
Yes.

01:29:24.950 --> 01:29:27.850
Your cargo's gone, I'm afraid.

01:29:28.060 --> 01:29:31.080
- It was seized by...
- I know already.

01:29:31.290 --> 01:29:34.590
- How do you know?
- I watched.

01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:38.360
I don't believe this.
Cox's going to go fucking spare!

01:29:38.570 --> 01:29:41.900
We are in shit.
You lot have fucked up again.

01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:44.730
Oh, fucking hell.

01:29:45.210 --> 01:29:47.800
Leave it to me, lads.
I'll explain to Inspector Cox...

01:29:48.010 --> 01:29:51.070
...that his suspect has scarpered
because of your blundering.

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:53.710
Knob heads. Helmets off.

01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:05.150
Does this settle things, then?

01:30:25.780 --> 01:30:28.250
Tango Foxtrot, over.

01:30:28.450 --> 01:30:31.040
Delta Uniform.

01:30:39.030 --> 01:30:40.890
How did that other errand go?

01:30:41.130 --> 01:30:44.160
Success, as far as I could make out.

01:30:47.670 --> 01:30:50.140
Where is my fucking prisoner?

01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:53.140
- You old ladies couldn't catch a cold.
- Sir, I just...

01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:56.140
Shut up, you soppy wanker.

01:30:56.340 --> 01:30:58.870
- Go.
- Dingo Bongo.

01:31:00.120 --> 01:31:02.710
- Is this area now secure?
- Yes, sir.

01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:04.550
You can fuck off, then.

01:31:05.520 --> 01:31:08.920
So where are the pills, genius?

01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:11.790
I think this is them now.

01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:17.320
What the fuck?

01:31:20.100 --> 01:31:22.540
- Couldn't leave this behind.
- Greenies.

01:31:26.010 --> 01:31:28.980
You are in the wrong game.
You should work with us.

01:31:29.180 --> 01:31:33.270
- Are we square?
- Yeah, we're sweet.

01:31:33.480 --> 01:31:36.820
It seems so. Your pills
are in the back. Help yourself.

01:32:13.660 --> 01:32:15.050
Hello.

01:32:16.420 --> 01:32:20.690
Okay. Yes, it will do. Bye-bye.

01:32:24.570 --> 01:32:28.370
You're off the hook, Morty.
Freddie Hurst is out of his coma.

01:32:31.870 --> 01:32:33.700
Good news.

01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:37.270
- Yeah.
- Good news, mate.

01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:39.810
Listen, I've got one for you.

01:32:40.020 --> 01:32:42.450
Irishman caught his son
snorting Charlie.

01:32:42.650 --> 01:32:46.280
He said, "If I catch you doing that
again, I'll rub your fucking nose in it."

01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:15.810
- Do you have the pills?
- In the cars.

01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:19.950
Boss wants to see you in his office.

01:33:28.730 --> 01:33:31.220
Come in. Sit down.

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:39.130
Here you are. Payment.

01:33:51.150 --> 01:33:55.020
- You look shocked, son.
- Are you taking the fucking piss?

01:33:55.260 --> 01:34:01.530
You and Jimmy have caused my little
angel Charlotte considerable anxiety.

01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:04.990
She's off to Arizona
for a course of intense treatment.

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:09.230
I'm keeping those pills for myself,
by way of compensation.

01:34:09.440 --> 01:34:13.970
I think I'm entitled. Simple. End of.

01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:17.980
The amount of trouble
you've caused the last few days.

01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:20.110
Jimmy.

01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:22.340
Poor little Jimmy.

01:34:23.080 --> 01:34:24.810
It would be in your interests...

01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:28.480
...if this thing finishes here,
now, today. Understand?

01:34:29.490 --> 01:34:33.550
It doesn't matter what I do.
This lot are going to come after you.

01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:38.000
They're too long in the tooth
to rampage round the country...

01:34:38.200 --> 01:34:41.230
...looking for revenge. Look at them.

01:34:41.440 --> 01:34:45.460
Bunch of under endowed,
aging fuck-pigs.

01:34:45.670 --> 01:34:47.110
Are you enjoying this?

01:34:47.310 --> 01:34:50.440
No. On the contrary.
Take it as a compliment.

01:34:50.650 --> 01:34:52.640
You're a bright young man.

01:34:52.850 --> 01:34:55.650
This monkey business is
in your blood, under your skin.

01:34:55.850 --> 01:35:00.180
You're not getting out, you're just
getting in. I've every faith in you.

01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:03.880
One day, it will be you sitting here...

01:35:04.090 --> 01:35:07.290
...telling some Young Turk
the facts of life.

01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:11.360
And they are, Mr. Temple?

01:35:18.140 --> 01:35:21.070
You're born, you take shit.

01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:24.580
Get out in the world,
you take more shit.

01:35:24.780 --> 01:35:29.010
Climb a little higher,
you take less shit.

01:35:29.250 --> 01:35:32.010
Until one day, you're up
in the rarefied atmosphere...

01:35:32.250 --> 01:35:34.650
...and you've forgotten
what shit even looks like.

01:35:37.630 --> 01:35:40.090
Welcome to the layer cake, son.

01:35:56.810 --> 01:36:00.080
This thing ends here, tonight.
You understand?

01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:03.480
Drug money's easy money, not grief.

01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:07.180
The odds, as you can see,
are against you.

01:36:07.620 --> 01:36:08.950
Good night.

01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:44.460
If you're going to hang around
in this game...

01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:46.490
... that's where you've
got to aim to be.

01:36:46.690 --> 01:36:50.760
In your bonded warehouse with
the ex-soldiers doing the dirty work...

01:36:50.970 --> 01:36:53.090
... while you deliver
the suspect lecture...

01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:56.900
... to baffle your opponents
and cover your tracks.

01:36:58.010 --> 01:37:02.270
The art of good business
is being a good middleman.

01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:06.950
Putting people together. I'll always
thank Eddie for telling me that.

01:37:08.320 --> 01:37:11.340
It's all about honour and respect.

01:37:12.020 --> 01:37:15.580
This is the end, Mr. Duke,
as I told you.

01:37:59.770 --> 01:38:05.570
Do you know what?
I fucking enjoyed that, brother.

01:38:05.770 --> 01:38:09.730
Just like the old days, Shanks.
A nice bit of armed robbery.

01:38:11.250 --> 01:38:14.610
All right? Where do you want
the money sent, lah?

01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:18.380
I'll let you know as soon as I do.
Again, I am sorry about Lucky.

01:38:18.590 --> 01:38:23.890
Don't worry about it, kidder.
Man was a prick, anyway. Later.

01:38:24.560 --> 01:38:26.080
- Ready?
- Yeah. Let's go.

01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:30.860
Did I really think Eddie was going to
give me 3 million for those pills?

01:38:31.070 --> 01:38:33.190
Did I fuck.

01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:37.530
But suddenly there was a void
where once there was Jimmy Price.

01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:41.140
After a couple days, Eddie's little
"getting in and getting out" speech...

01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:45.610
... started to make sense.

01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:15.430
- Angelo. Thank you.
- Thank you very much.

01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:18.410
- Can we get some privacy?
- Of course.

01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:27.720
The king is dead.

01:39:28.490 --> 01:39:30.250
Long live the king.

01:39:35.230 --> 01:39:36.990
Well, I'm honoured.

01:39:39.130 --> 01:39:42.570
But for me this is all over.
I'm getting out.

01:39:42.770 --> 01:39:45.000
What was true then is true now.

01:39:45.910 --> 01:39:49.210
Have a plan. Stick to it.

01:39:49.410 --> 01:39:52.140
So I'm sure you must have
lots to discuss...

01:39:52.350 --> 01:39:54.610
...but I have no business being here.

01:39:56.820 --> 01:39:58.950
I've got someone to meet.

01:40:01.190 --> 01:40:02.780
Adios, amigos.

01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:14.230
Paul the boatman.

01:40:14.440 --> 01:40:15.930
Kinky.

01:40:16.140 --> 01:40:17.430
The Duke.

01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:19.400
Slasher.

01:40:19.610 --> 01:40:21.200
Kilburn Jerry.

01:40:21.410 --> 01:40:23.070
Crazy Larry.

01:40:23.280 --> 01:40:25.010
Mr. Lucky.

01:40:25.210 --> 01:40:26.940
Troop.

01:40:28.350 --> 01:40:29.910
Jimmy.

01:40:31.690 --> 01:40:34.090
I don't want to add my name
to that list.

01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:40.050
My name? If you knew that,
you'd be as clever as me.

01:40:40.260 --> 01:40:42.230
No!

01:40:46.470 --> 01:40:48.700
I'm sorry.
