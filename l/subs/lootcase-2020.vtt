WEBVTT

02:22.080 --> 02:26.880
Never before had anyone felt
such ecstasy at a public urinal

02:27.120 --> 02:29.280
as Nandan did that fateful night.

02:31.280 --> 02:32.680
For the last time...

02:33.880 --> 02:35.200
whose bag is this?

02:56.120 --> 02:59.320
A few days ago.

03:12.960 --> 03:13.840
Hey, you!

03:15.000 --> 03:16.840
Hat fellow!
Come here.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.640
Yes... you.

03:19.720 --> 03:22.480
What's so funny?

03:23.600 --> 03:25.280
Sir...

03:25.480 --> 03:30.320
Er... you are Don Jameel, aren't you?

03:31.840 --> 03:32.960
Yeah, why?

03:33.040 --> 03:36.280
See? I told you.
This is Don Jameel.

03:36.560 --> 03:37.800
Hold on a second.

03:37.960 --> 03:40.640
Did you also own two Mercedes' before this?

03:40.960 --> 03:42.680
And sported a royal moustache?

03:43.200 --> 03:44.040
Yeah... so?

03:46.640 --> 03:47.880
This is you, isn't it?

03:48.440 --> 03:50.440
Yeah... from ten years ago!

03:50.600 --> 03:51.880
Where did you find this?

03:56.280 --> 03:58.400
That's when the can of worms opened.

03:58.920 --> 04:03.080
Had Jameel not died,
there'd be no story to tell.

04:03.840 --> 04:07.680
Thus the circle of life
keeps the jungle alive.

04:07.840 --> 04:10.720
After a lazy day, this crocodile
is ravenously hungry.

04:13.240 --> 04:15.120
Bala, the shooters
are unknown hired guns.

04:15.200 --> 04:17.720
But it was Omar's boys
that put the contract on Don Jameel.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.880
Bala, let's kill Omar
in his own back yard.

04:21.400 --> 04:24.400
Just like every criminal
has an animal inside,

04:24.720 --> 04:30.480
every animal has a criminal inside, too.
At least, according to Don Bala.

04:30.880 --> 04:33.080
-Rajan.
-Yes, boss.

04:34.040 --> 04:37.160
The time has come for you to become
a Crocodilus Noctilus.

04:40.120 --> 04:41.120
What?

04:41.280 --> 04:42.520
Observe.

04:43.280 --> 04:46.320
Crocodilus aka Crocodile.

04:46.720 --> 04:48.760
King of the African rivers.

04:49.120 --> 04:50.200
That's you.

04:50.840 --> 04:52.000
-Me?
-Yes.

04:53.480 --> 04:54.520
And that...

04:54.920 --> 04:58.640
Aepyceros Melampus... meaning deer.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.520
That's Omar.

05:00.720 --> 05:04.440
Look, how he's sneaking
into our territory.

05:06.680 --> 05:09.520
The scoundrel has Legislator Patil
for a Godfather.

05:09.800 --> 05:11.400
But, we'll nail him.

05:12.280 --> 05:14.640
The innocent deer just wants
to quench his thirst

05:14.720 --> 05:17.240
and is oblivious
of the lurking danger.

05:18.120 --> 05:22.240
Even the deer can't escape
the cycle of life and death.

05:22.720 --> 05:24.760
That's how Omar's story will end.

05:25.160 --> 05:29.400
Damn right, boss.
Perfect time to inaugurate my new gun.

05:30.320 --> 05:35.400
-Graduate... got yourself a new gun?
-Yes, boss.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.120
Got yourself a Nat Geo subscription?

05:39.440 --> 05:40.640
Nat Geo?

05:42.840 --> 05:44.280
Evidently not.

05:50.320 --> 05:52.720
Learn from nature.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.160
It's a jungle out there.

05:55.440 --> 05:57.680
And in the jungle we all gotta stay alert!

06:01.200 --> 06:04.280
Bala Rathod! Heard of him?

06:04.880 --> 06:06.280
Think he'll take it lying down?

06:07.600 --> 06:10.840
Jameel wasn't to be killed now.
Hadn't I made it clear?

06:11.400 --> 06:13.040
Have you lost your marbles?

06:13.480 --> 06:15.360
Omar, I'm sorry.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.720
"Omar, I'm sorry."

06:18.240 --> 06:20.800
Don Omar and Abdul have
a give and take relationship.

06:21.000 --> 06:24.280
Abdul takes a wrong decision
and Omar gives it back.

06:24.360 --> 06:27.880
Abdul, you moron, if you weren't
my brother-in-law, I'd kill you.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.840
Moron!

06:30.280 --> 06:31.640
What are you doing?

06:31.880 --> 06:34.200
Counting the number of times
I called you a moron?

06:35.640 --> 06:39.320
Sister's told me to count up to 10
when I get angry.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.120
Oh, you are angry?

06:43.120 --> 06:47.680
Moron, what am I gonna tell Patil?
Elections are around the corner.

06:47.800 --> 06:52.200
Patil sahab, please...
But isn't Housing your portfolio?

06:52.440 --> 06:56.840
Word is you've subsidised land deals
for your Minister friends in Delhi.

06:57.200 --> 06:59.080
Please explain.

06:59.440 --> 07:04.600
I got two words for you.

07:07.600 --> 07:08.800
Next question.

07:11.320 --> 07:17.080
Meet the super boss, Legislator Patil.
The Big Daddy of this world.

07:17.840 --> 07:19.080
Minister Tripathi.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.520
But Daddy has a Daddy too!

07:21.640 --> 07:23.040
Yes, Tripathi-ji.
Order, sir.

07:23.160 --> 07:28.280
Some legislators are coming home
to explore a new friendship.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.400
Yes.

07:29.480 --> 07:31.280
I need 10 boxes of sweets delivered...

07:31.400 --> 07:33.840
Of course. They'll be there, sir.

07:34.080 --> 07:36.000
Perfect... and the parcel?

07:36.800 --> 07:39.680
Sir, Subhash will personally
deliver it in a few days.

07:39.840 --> 07:41.880
Fine.

07:41.960 --> 07:44.880
Sir, the party workers are on steroids...

07:45.000 --> 07:47.920
-Sure, I'll talk to you later.
-And... Victory to India, sir.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.520
I think the network's bad.

07:56.400 --> 08:00.240
And far, far away
from this network coverage of crime

08:00.560 --> 08:07.360
is our common man, Nandan,
clueless about that world.

08:08.520 --> 08:10.800
Aayush, do your homework on time.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.160
Don't you want to be smart
like your papa?

08:14.880 --> 08:16.560
Papa, 14 times 3 is?

08:17.440 --> 08:18.440
14 times 3...

08:18.520 --> 08:22.320
Actually, Nandan Kumar
is generally clueless.

08:23.480 --> 08:25.040
42, write that down.

08:25.160 --> 08:26.920
I was just going to say that.

08:27.160 --> 08:28.520
We're out of sugar.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.760
And we need an extra gas cylinder.

08:32.560 --> 08:35.000
And next Saturday, you are taking me
to the water park too.

08:35.120 --> 08:37.760
We'll go, boss!
Finish your homework first.

08:39.960 --> 08:42.240
Wear your shirt,
drink your milk, quick!

08:42.560 --> 08:44.120
Water park? My foot.

08:45.360 --> 08:47.880
Just like the 'Snow peak vacation
in Shimla'?

08:48.000 --> 08:49.800
At least, don't make
false promises to your child.

08:49.920 --> 08:51.680
False promise?

08:52.200 --> 08:55.000
I see, have we ever gone to Shimla?

08:55.240 --> 08:58.360
I wanted to visit a snow peak,
not skin snow peas.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.040
Shimla, my foot!

09:00.160 --> 09:02.840
I even knitted a sweater,
it's gathering dust.

09:03.080 --> 09:06.720
I told you to start a side business
for some extra income.

09:06.960 --> 09:07.800
But, no!

09:08.120 --> 09:10.520
You won't do it,
nor will you allow me to do it!

09:10.600 --> 09:12.760
What business?

09:13.400 --> 09:19.000
Didn't Jaya offer a partnership
in her pickle business?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.240
It'll cost only 80,000.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.320
She's going to get you
in a pickle worth 80,000!

09:24.520 --> 09:26.320
Pickles and pappadums.

09:26.560 --> 09:29.880
Seriously. There's high demand for it.
I'll quit my job.

09:30.920 --> 09:34.400
Lata, where's 80,000
going to come from?

09:35.440 --> 09:36.640
Now we are talking.

09:37.240 --> 09:40.960
If you don't give sister Binu money
for six months... that's where.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.360
What a miserable life!

09:42.880 --> 09:46.160
Must we drag sister Binu
into everything? She's...

09:46.480 --> 09:48.640
-I have to plan everything myself...
-Ramlal-ji!

09:48.720 --> 09:50.120
Pack lunch... drop Aayush off.

09:50.240 --> 09:51.880
It's Ramlal-ji.
Please come in.

09:52.040 --> 09:54.240
I came to drop off my house keys.

09:54.320 --> 09:55.680
Oh, the keys.

09:55.880 --> 09:57.600
Please come in.
Have a cup of tea?

09:57.960 --> 09:59.600
We're out of sugar.

10:20.800 --> 10:25.480
Papa, I know things have been
a bit tight of late.

10:26.720 --> 10:31.240
But, that doesn't mean you cancel
my water park trip.

10:32.040 --> 10:34.560
Get lost! Get ready for school.

10:46.320 --> 10:47.840
Patil sahab is here.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.200
Up.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.560
-Salaam, Patil sahab.
-Omar.

10:52.840 --> 10:54.600
Carry on. I'll finish this meeting.

10:54.680 --> 10:56.840
Patil sahab, an honest mistake...
we messed it up with Jameel.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.520
-I had told the boys...
-Omar... Omar.

10:59.600 --> 11:01.680
Omar, did I ask?

11:02.080 --> 11:06.160
Jameel was destined to die.
Good thing, he died!

11:06.880 --> 11:08.480
Subhash, protein shake.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.280
Wonderful.

11:19.880 --> 11:23.680
Tell me, when did you last go to jail?

11:25.440 --> 11:26.320
Patil sahab?

11:29.440 --> 11:30.480
What happened?

11:32.840 --> 11:35.040
You thought, I was going to
send you to jail?

11:35.120 --> 11:36.760
For killing Jameel?

11:38.640 --> 11:40.200
This is my biggest problem.

11:40.840 --> 11:43.200
People always misunderstand me.

11:43.280 --> 11:47.880
I should just keep quiet.
No... I'm not going to talk. I...

11:48.240 --> 11:50.800
Please forgive me.
I'll take an oath of silence.

11:50.920 --> 11:52.960
-Sorry, Patil sahab.
-I'll not utter a word.

11:53.040 --> 11:55.120
Sir, I didn't misunderstand you.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.200
You?

12:02.000 --> 12:03.880
Why would I send you to jail?

12:04.480 --> 12:09.480
Look, if I scratch your back
in Jameel's matter, won't you scratch mine?

12:12.440 --> 12:13.840
Won't you?

12:16.040 --> 12:18.040
We must help each other.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.840
Take Tripathi-ji for instance.
The Resource Minister.

12:22.440 --> 12:25.320
He wants my help, too.
He wants something delivered.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.520
He told me,
"Patil, deliver it personally."

12:29.360 --> 12:32.200
You tell me, should I?

12:34.520 --> 12:35.320
Should I?

12:38.400 --> 12:40.400
See that, Subhash?

12:41.160 --> 12:44.000
He'd rather deliver it himself,
than put me through the trouble.

12:46.200 --> 12:47.200
Who, me?

12:54.880 --> 12:56.160
What do I have to do?

12:56.280 --> 12:57.480
It's simple.

12:57.640 --> 12:59.760
Subhash will give you
a suitcase day after tomorrow.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.280
It's got a 100 million.

13:01.440 --> 13:04.600
All you gotta do is take it safely
to Tripathi-ji's personal assistant.

13:04.720 --> 13:05.760
Can you do that?

13:06.640 --> 13:07.480
Of course.

13:18.680 --> 13:19.840
Started?

13:24.200 --> 13:25.520
Yes!

13:26.880 --> 13:29.000
Well done, Nandan, well done!

13:29.280 --> 13:33.200
You're a strong contender for
'The Kirodimal Employee of the Year' award.

13:33.320 --> 13:34.520
Thank you.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.120
Keep up the good work,
day and night.

13:37.480 --> 13:41.400
That reminds me, I need you to work
the night-shift the next two days.

13:41.920 --> 13:45.080
Be on time.
Good boy.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.640
Vasant Seth... what a man!

13:51.160 --> 13:56.600
First, he praises you to the skies
then crash lands you into slavery.

13:58.160 --> 14:00.360
Goodnight, in advance.

14:05.320 --> 14:08.120
He wants me to do a double shift
on Monday and Tuesday.

14:08.480 --> 14:09.760
Damn, night shifts.

14:10.000 --> 14:13.320
All that ever changes is our shifts,
not our destiny.

14:14.560 --> 14:19.360
It's not that we can't make big bucks,
like these politicians.

14:20.680 --> 14:21.720
Seriously.

14:21.960 --> 14:25.440
We've got the talent.
And needless to say, the nerve, too.

14:26.440 --> 14:28.080
But, what holds us back?

14:29.320 --> 14:30.360
Our values.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.640
These values come in the way.

14:33.520 --> 14:36.360
Who'll break the news to the wife?
Vasant Seth?

14:39.080 --> 14:41.120
Noodles.

14:41.720 --> 14:42.840
Fried Rice.

14:42.960 --> 14:45.640
And two Manchow soups
split three ways.

14:45.880 --> 14:47.200
Enjoy!

14:47.440 --> 14:48.880
Where's the dessert?

14:49.280 --> 14:51.640
You want it mixed with the noodles?
Finish this first.

14:51.880 --> 14:53.280
I'm just letting you know.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.960
Fine! Eat your noodles.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.320
When do you start night duty?

15:05.200 --> 15:06.720
Night duty?

15:07.840 --> 15:09.120
What are you saying?

15:09.200 --> 15:11.320
It's either night duty,
or your sister needs money.

15:11.720 --> 15:15.120
To what do we owe this Chinese feast?

15:18.080 --> 15:19.600
Which is it?

15:20.320 --> 15:21.440
Night duty.

15:25.000 --> 15:27.160
At least, this way we got to eat out.

15:27.680 --> 15:28.800
It was good.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.320
It'll all be good from now on.

15:30.560 --> 15:33.480
I'll have my own printing press.
You'll have a pickle business.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.800
We'll holiday in Manali, Shimla...
Just say where you want to go?

15:36.120 --> 15:37.400
For now, let's just go home.

15:38.640 --> 15:40.640
By the way, when is the night duty?

15:42.120 --> 15:43.880
Actually, tomorrow and day after.

15:44.440 --> 15:48.120
But, if you like... I can start tonight.

16:09.800 --> 16:11.560
-Hey!
-What?

16:11.680 --> 16:13.320
-Listen...
-Aayush will wake up.

16:13.440 --> 16:15.160
Let him.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.440
All it takes is Chinese food
to put you in the mood.

16:18.840 --> 16:22.880
You're looking as hot as Schezwan rice.

16:23.160 --> 16:24.800
Have you been smoking?

16:25.080 --> 16:25.800
No.

16:25.880 --> 16:27.480
Go away, liar!

16:27.600 --> 16:30.400
Not so fast!
My chicken hakka noodles.

16:31.440 --> 16:33.680
It's Holy vegetarian day!

16:34.960 --> 16:37.400
Fine... vegetarian noodles!

16:38.320 --> 16:41.480
Liar!
What else?

16:41.680 --> 16:45.920
One bowl of Manchow soup, to share.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.680
To share?

16:48.160 --> 16:50.040
Must we share in your fantasy, too?

16:50.120 --> 16:53.640
Sharing is caring, baby.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.440
Fine.

17:02.920 --> 17:06.360
Rajan, your time to be a crocodile
has arrived.

17:07.920 --> 17:09.200
We've got a tip.

17:10.840 --> 17:14.480
Omar's going to drop off
Patil's 100 million to Tripathi.

17:15.720 --> 17:17.360
You'll ambush him mid-way.

17:17.640 --> 17:21.080
The loot is ours,
and who gets framed?

17:21.480 --> 17:22.760
Omar.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.280
But, Omar has gone underground.

17:28.400 --> 17:29.720
Underground?

17:32.480 --> 17:36.080
The rascal is trying to be
a Lumbricus Terrestris.

17:42.440 --> 17:45.560
You still haven't subscribed
to Nat Geo?

17:56.480 --> 17:58.880
Graduate had informed the cable guy.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.560
-Boss, I told him...
-Shut up and listen.

18:05.400 --> 18:08.160
Lumbricus Terrestris... aka...

18:09.840 --> 18:10.680
Aka?

18:10.840 --> 18:11.720
Aka...

18:12.240 --> 18:13.400
-Ah! Aka...
-Aka...

18:15.120 --> 18:16.920
Aka... earthworm.

18:17.440 --> 18:18.880
Earthworm.

18:19.440 --> 18:21.920
This species is found underground.

18:22.520 --> 18:26.680
But, when it rains,
they inevitably surface.

18:28.040 --> 18:29.640
Omar too, shall surface

18:30.920 --> 18:33.480
when 100 million rains down.

18:37.360 --> 18:38.120
Be ready.

18:38.280 --> 18:39.480
We are!

18:39.520 --> 18:40.880
Very ready!

18:43.560 --> 18:44.400
Ready.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.960
Aayush, did you find this eraser
or did you steal it?

18:53.240 --> 18:57.120
Aayush, I'll ask you again.
Did you find it or steal it?

18:58.280 --> 19:00.320
It was on Deeksha's bench.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.800
Did you ask her for it?

19:01.920 --> 19:03.760
-No.
-That's called stealing.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.800
-What's all this ruckus?
-Ask God's forgiveness.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.080
-Sorry...
-Never again!

19:08.160 --> 19:09.480
He's just a child. Let him be.

19:09.560 --> 19:12.480
That's why I'm teaching him now.
Apologise!

19:12.600 --> 19:16.440
-Sorry. Never again.
-Say it again.

19:16.640 --> 19:20.080
Mukesh, money's a bit tight.

19:20.200 --> 19:22.400
How about, I give it next week?

19:24.280 --> 19:25.040
Great.

19:25.360 --> 19:28.280
Thank you.
Next week for sure.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.640
Didn't you get your salary?

19:32.880 --> 19:34.600
Then why didn't you pay
Mukesh the rent?

19:34.680 --> 19:37.040
-I...
-Where did the money go?

19:38.000 --> 19:40.760
I see... gave it to your sister.

19:41.280 --> 19:43.120
-Listen to me.
-What's left to listen?

19:43.280 --> 19:46.160
We barely make ends meet
and you dole out charity like this?

19:46.600 --> 19:48.760
That's why you took us out for Chinese!

19:49.160 --> 19:50.720
Your son is learning to lie from you.

19:50.840 --> 19:52.160
That's nonsense!

19:52.240 --> 19:53.960
It's either your way or the highway!

19:54.160 --> 19:56.520
-Who listens to me in this house?
-What rubbish!

19:57.080 --> 19:59.360
Always your word against mine.

19:59.560 --> 20:01.080
Your word is the final word.
And my word?

20:01.280 --> 20:04.400
In this war of words,
what is the weight of my words?

20:04.560 --> 20:05.720
Quarter kilo.

20:06.840 --> 20:07.920
Lentils

20:08.640 --> 20:10.080
and kidney beans

20:11.160 --> 20:15.440
chilly, sugar, coriander

20:15.800 --> 20:17.920
and a pack of safety pins.

20:18.480 --> 20:21.880
Madam, my salary?

20:22.240 --> 20:26.560
Salary? We have no money
for your salary, Balu.

20:26.640 --> 20:30.000
But, I'm sure we can treat you
to Chinese food instead.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.800
Ramlal-ji!
Please come.

20:34.920 --> 20:36.320
-Dropping off my house keys.
-Yes, keys.

20:36.440 --> 20:39.640
I'm going to my home-town for 15 days.
Will spend time with family.

20:39.720 --> 20:41.560
And I don't want tea.

20:41.680 --> 20:43.760
Perfect! All our tea cups are broken.

20:51.440 --> 20:55.240
What's with you? One day there's no sugar,
another day it's shattered cups.

20:56.360 --> 20:58.360
My destiny is shattered!

20:58.600 --> 21:01.000
We were seriously out of sugar.
Did you get it yesterday?

21:01.240 --> 21:03.800
The promises you made before marriage!

21:04.000 --> 21:06.120
"One day, I'll lay the moon
and the stars at your feet!"

21:06.160 --> 21:08.960
I've been asking for an extra gas cylinder.
Did you get it?

21:13.160 --> 21:15.000
No... you're right.

21:19.480 --> 21:22.000
Before marriage I should've told you,

21:22.440 --> 21:26.320
"My love, one day I shall lay
an extra gas cylinder at your feet."

21:56.560 --> 21:57.440
Ready?

21:57.640 --> 21:59.000
Ready... switch it on.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.200
Yes, ready?

22:02.120 --> 22:03.880
-Omar, ready?
-Ready!

22:06.560 --> 22:07.400
Ready?

22:08.760 --> 22:09.600
Ready.

23:52.760 --> 23:55.960
For the last time... whose bag is it?

24:38.080 --> 24:42.000
Sir, where to?
Domestic or international?

24:42.120 --> 24:43.920
I don't need a ride... go on.

24:47.240 --> 24:48.720
Wait!

24:49.280 --> 24:51.760
Sir, hope there's no body inside?

24:52.400 --> 24:54.720
Of course, there's no money inside.
Let's go.

25:00.520 --> 25:02.120
So, where to?

25:02.400 --> 25:04.760
Azad Nagar... close to it.

25:05.200 --> 25:07.440
-Azad Nagar?
-Close to it.

25:07.920 --> 25:11.320
And you wanted to drag this heavy suitcase
all the way to Azad Nagar?

25:11.440 --> 25:14.240
Of course not.
That's why I hired a rickshaw.

25:14.440 --> 25:16.160
Are you from Azad Nagar?

25:16.440 --> 25:19.520
Close to it. No...
Will you just drive?

25:34.120 --> 25:35.240
Hello, brother.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.960
Yes, I've finally reached Mumbai.

25:38.800 --> 25:40.400
Yes... I'll explain.

25:40.800 --> 25:43.680
My taxi had broken down.
So I hired a rickshaw.

25:43.840 --> 25:45.920
Now, I'm heading towards Azad Nagar...
Close to it.

25:46.000 --> 25:49.440
As we all know,
my friend stays there. Not me.

25:49.680 --> 25:51.680
Obviously, I've stuffed the suitcase
with clothes.

25:51.760 --> 25:53.760
Clothes, clothes and more clothes.

25:54.280 --> 25:55.080
Yeah.

25:55.360 --> 25:58.400
And... I'm going to stay there
just for tonight.

25:58.600 --> 26:00.640
Just for tonight.

26:00.720 --> 26:02.440
And tomorrow,
I head to sister Binu's place.

26:02.640 --> 26:04.120
Because, as you know
I don't live here.

26:04.280 --> 26:07.520
And after tonight, I don't intend
to go back there. Ever.

26:07.880 --> 26:08.920
Never ever!

26:09.320 --> 26:12.640
Bye, brother.

26:17.240 --> 26:20.480
Stop, stop... you've overshot.
I had to get off earlier.

26:20.760 --> 26:22.440
You've got me way ahead.

26:29.480 --> 26:30.720
This is way ahead.

26:35.840 --> 26:37.600
Keep this.

26:46.960 --> 26:48.880
Should I come back in the morning?

26:49.080 --> 26:50.960
To drop you to sister Binu's house?

28:15.720 --> 28:18.200
Today's menu... saucy, home-made Chinese.

28:18.520 --> 28:22.200
Manchurian-Lung-Fung Rice.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.880
Eat all you want.

28:30.480 --> 28:31.600
Where's Aayush?

28:32.480 --> 28:34.880
Sent off to sister Binu's house.

28:45.720 --> 28:47.000
Are you still upset?

28:47.360 --> 28:49.280
Okay, I apologise for the morning fight.

28:49.400 --> 28:51.320
No, no... I'm not upset.

28:51.600 --> 28:54.640
It's just... I've got acidity.

28:55.760 --> 29:00.240
Won't be able to eat...
Chinese tonight.

29:21.240 --> 29:23.480
Not tonight... sweetheart!

29:25.160 --> 29:26.440
For the acidity.

29:27.400 --> 29:28.560
Oh.

31:25.320 --> 31:26.640
What were you doing outside?

31:26.720 --> 31:28.080
I...

31:28.200 --> 31:29.480
Smoking again?

31:30.400 --> 31:33.240
Yes, smoking.

31:35.880 --> 31:37.440
I can't smell anything.

31:39.120 --> 31:40.000
That's ridiculous!

31:40.320 --> 31:41.680
When I don't smoke,
you say I do.

31:41.760 --> 31:43.520
And when I do,
you don't believe me!

31:43.600 --> 31:45.880
How's that fair?
You're looking sexy.

31:47.920 --> 31:50.320
Very sexy... Manchow...

31:51.000 --> 31:53.480
Liar!
What else?

31:53.840 --> 31:55.320
Today isn't a holy day, is it?

31:55.520 --> 31:58.680
So, chicken noodles and super spicy.

32:59.560 --> 33:01.240
How did this happen?

33:01.840 --> 33:05.000
Tell me from the beginning.
From the very beginning.

33:06.080 --> 33:09.360
Patil sahab, as planned,
we left with the suitcase.

33:09.840 --> 33:15.840
At Pipe Road Junction a car rammed into us
and our way got

33:16.000 --> 33:20.680
Blocked... in a way that Omar was trapped.

33:20.880 --> 33:21.760
Keep talking.

33:21.880 --> 33:23.880
At first I thought
it was an accident.

33:23.960 --> 33:28.800
But when I saw two gun-toting men,
I figured it was an ambush.

33:28.920 --> 33:31.000
They demanded the suitcase.

33:31.120 --> 33:32.640
-Give me the suitcase.
-What suitcase?

33:32.920 --> 33:33.960
We had no choice.

33:34.080 --> 33:36.360
Get the bag out!

33:36.960 --> 33:40.080
That's when I signalled Vignesh.

33:40.280 --> 33:42.480
Make it quick.

33:42.560 --> 33:45.880
Then, for self-defence
I knocked Omar in the head.

33:47.400 --> 33:50.440
Suddenly, a third guy jumped
out of the car

33:50.960 --> 33:53.640
and started firing at us
like a lunatic.

33:54.240 --> 33:56.080
Bullets were flying on both sides.

33:56.200 --> 33:57.480
All of a sudden...

33:57.560 --> 33:58.440
Police!

33:58.640 --> 34:02.160
We had the cops on one side,
and a dead Kamraj on the other.

34:02.760 --> 34:06.440
His foot was jammed on the accelerator.

34:06.720 --> 34:09.120
The car moved forward
as we struggled to stay with it.

34:09.240 --> 34:10.320
We struggled hard.

34:10.400 --> 34:13.320
David tried but couldn't stop the car.

34:20.880 --> 34:22.680
-Move!
-We had to get away

34:22.800 --> 34:24.840
before the cops
could catch us with guns.

34:29.320 --> 34:30.800
The bag was way too heavy.

34:31.160 --> 34:34.400
We had to avoid the cops.
We had nowhere to run.

34:34.760 --> 34:39.520
Thought we'd hide the bag
and come back for it in an hour.

34:43.360 --> 34:46.880
We went back
but didn't find the suitcase.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.320
So, what did you find?

35:00.680 --> 35:03.560
Where's the rest of the suitcase?

35:15.320 --> 35:16.480
Where were you?

35:18.920 --> 35:20.640
I've been searching for you.

35:22.440 --> 35:23.840
All my life.

35:28.400 --> 35:31.880
Go away.
I'm not talking to you!

35:56.520 --> 35:59.360
Bala, I'm asking you,
give it to me straight.

35:59.960 --> 36:01.960
Give it to you straight?

36:02.440 --> 36:05.560
How dare you, Chameleon Calyptratus
of Madagascar?

36:09.920 --> 36:10.560
Hello?

36:10.680 --> 36:12.400
You chameleon!

36:13.320 --> 36:14.960
Changed colours so quickly?

36:15.320 --> 36:17.080
I want answers.

36:17.720 --> 36:19.080
About Jameel's murder.

36:20.000 --> 36:24.040
Bala, I know it was your boys that
ambushed us and grabbed the 100 million.

36:25.480 --> 36:26.640
Ambush?

36:27.640 --> 36:29.280
And 100 million?

36:29.680 --> 36:32.480
What fool trusted you
with so much cash?

36:33.640 --> 36:34.840
And here's the deal, kid.

36:35.080 --> 36:38.840
Even if I had your money,
I would never return it.

36:39.400 --> 36:41.800
Do what you want.

36:42.240 --> 36:45.080
Jameel's life is worth
much more than 100 million.

36:47.760 --> 36:51.680
Congratulations! That went well.

36:52.160 --> 36:55.480
Tell me something.
Why will Bala do this?

36:55.920 --> 36:58.840
Let's say he did it.
Why would he own up?

36:59.200 --> 37:02.880
Patil sahab, give me two days.
I have a strong suspicion on Bala.

37:02.960 --> 37:06.640
I have a strong suspicion on you, too.
Morons! Can't get anything right.

37:08.360 --> 37:11.120
Subhash, before Tripathi starts
frothing with rage

37:11.360 --> 37:13.400
go deliver the file to his assistant.

37:14.680 --> 37:18.120
File? You said it was a parcel.

37:18.520 --> 37:21.400
The parcel had the file.
Now, scram!

37:23.320 --> 37:27.400
Omar, can you give this parcel
to Tripathi-ji's assistant?

37:27.560 --> 37:29.920
Or, I'll have to go all the way
just to drop it off.

37:30.160 --> 37:31.000
Don...

37:33.240 --> 37:34.920
-Don...
-What?

37:35.080 --> 37:36.640
Where do I put this parcel?

37:36.840 --> 37:38.160
Shove it in the bag.

37:42.480 --> 37:44.640
The file went with the suitcase?

37:45.360 --> 37:48.040
Do you even know what's in the file?

37:48.480 --> 37:50.520
Subhash! What have you done?

37:50.840 --> 37:52.640
Have you completely lost it?

37:54.000 --> 37:56.760
I'll re-open all your cases.

37:57.280 --> 37:59.800
Bring me that file!
Bring it back to me.

37:59.880 --> 38:03.040
-I will find it and get it back...
-Get out of here. Out!

38:04.160 --> 38:05.200
Get out.

38:05.920 --> 38:07.200
Out!

38:08.520 --> 38:11.680
Get out of here.

38:15.320 --> 38:21.200
Rajan, now I want that suitcase,
no matter what!

38:23.000 --> 38:27.280
You're like joy packed in a red bag.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.040
What shall I call you?

38:32.240 --> 38:35.040
Joy... Bagman.

38:35.960 --> 38:41.320
Yes! Joy Bagman... my best friend.

38:45.880 --> 38:50.680
Subhash, 25 years ago
we came here empty-handed

38:52.520 --> 38:55.080
we'll go back the same way,
and be farmers.

38:56.080 --> 38:59.320
Do you know what's in that file?

39:01.480 --> 39:07.880
The paper trail of the land deals
we swindled for Tripathi-ji's trust.

39:08.360 --> 39:11.120
The number of farmers we got rid of...

39:12.240 --> 39:14.120
Elections are round the corner.

39:14.280 --> 39:17.200
If that file comes into the public domain,
we're done for.

39:18.040 --> 39:19.880
Sir, if I had the slightest idea...

39:20.120 --> 39:24.640
You're a Minister's PA.
Not a rookie.

39:24.760 --> 39:26.240
Couldn't you ask me?

39:31.880 --> 39:33.720
It's Tripathi-ji!

39:34.800 --> 39:37.400
Tell him.

39:38.400 --> 39:41.000
Yes, sir. Namaste!

39:41.120 --> 39:42.520
-Patil.
-Order, sir.

39:42.600 --> 39:46.720
-The box of sweets never landed up.
-There was a bit of a mix up, sir.

39:47.240 --> 39:51.360
But, don't worry.
You'll have them by end of day.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.240
And the file?

39:54.520 --> 39:56.320
Patil?

39:56.440 --> 40:00.160
A couple of signatures are pending.

40:00.280 --> 40:02.920
You'll have it by the end of the week.
Rest assured.

40:03.040 --> 40:06.240
And sir, for the upcoming rally...

40:06.280 --> 40:09.280
-Let's just have the file, pronto!
-Yes, sir.

40:14.600 --> 40:15.720
Where's Kolte?

40:34.880 --> 40:40.440
How are you, Mushtaq?
Aka Salim, aka Sandeep.

40:45.000 --> 40:46.440
Hello, ma'am!

40:47.360 --> 40:49.080
Won't you offer us some tea?

40:52.680 --> 40:54.080
What did you think?

40:54.360 --> 40:59.400
That you'd change identities
and I cannot hunt you down?

41:03.920 --> 41:06.400
Thirsty, are you?

41:08.360 --> 41:09.240
Well, have some.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.440
Luckily, we found him here.

41:37.840 --> 41:40.320
Sir, what are you doing?

41:46.040 --> 41:47.840
This, is luck.

41:48.040 --> 41:50.800
That, my friend, is one month
of hard work. Got it?

41:52.480 --> 41:54.600
Now, wrap up the paper work.

42:09.080 --> 42:10.280
Patil sahab, Victory to India!

42:10.400 --> 42:12.640
Kolte, where are you?
Couldn't reach you.

42:12.920 --> 42:15.280
Yes, I was a tad busy.
How are you, sir?

42:15.440 --> 42:17.600
-What are you doing tonight?
-Patil sahab, I...

42:17.680 --> 42:20.240
I was just being courteous.
I don't care.

42:20.360 --> 42:23.760
-Come tonight.
-Yes, sir. Victory to India.

42:26.560 --> 42:31.000
The CBI raided the offices
of Corporator Yadunath Sawle.

42:31.520 --> 42:34.560
He was rumoured to be close to
a notorious gangster.

42:35.040 --> 42:35.920
Hello.

42:36.280 --> 42:37.960
You didn't tell me.

42:38.160 --> 42:38.920
What?

42:39.240 --> 42:41.240
What you should have told me?

42:41.760 --> 42:42.920
What?

42:43.240 --> 42:44.280
I love you.

42:46.360 --> 42:48.240
-Oh, that...
-Tell me now.

42:48.640 --> 42:52.280
Last night at 2 am, a shoot-out
was reported at Pipe Road Junction.

42:52.440 --> 42:54.360
-Hello?
-I love you... love you.

42:54.480 --> 42:57.560
The police have begun investigations.

42:57.680 --> 43:01.120
They are looking for evidence.

43:01.240 --> 43:04.960
The CCTV footage
will reveal everything!

43:06.040 --> 43:09.320
If they had it,
they'd have shown it, right?

43:09.760 --> 43:13.520
Nandan, now let's say you've done this.

43:14.920 --> 43:15.800
Me?

43:15.960 --> 43:18.120
Just assume that you did.

43:18.400 --> 43:19.960
If you were responsible.

43:20.080 --> 43:24.520
If they blabber about the CCTV footage
on the news, won't you leave town?

43:26.360 --> 43:29.120
Such things are never revealed
on the news.

43:34.920 --> 43:36.960
They missed noting down
the license plate.

43:37.320 --> 43:39.000
That would have been futile.

43:40.040 --> 43:42.400
Routinely, they use stolen cars
in such cases.

43:43.040 --> 43:45.200
I was told it was
a random shootout, sir.

43:45.400 --> 43:48.080
That's perfect.
Let's just sell that.

43:48.480 --> 43:50.320
That's the official version.

43:50.520 --> 43:53.880
You just have to do
one unofficial thing.

43:54.120 --> 43:56.720
Find me the suitcase.

43:57.760 --> 43:58.960
Suitcase?

43:59.160 --> 44:00.520
Why?

44:02.440 --> 44:05.000
Sir, it's been over eight hours.

44:05.680 --> 44:07.920
The suitcase must've left
the State by now.

44:08.920 --> 44:11.200
It's tough, sir.
Almost impossible.

44:13.400 --> 44:14.720
See that, Subhash.

44:17.040 --> 44:18.800
That's what I call experience.

44:19.560 --> 44:20.560
I like it!

44:21.840 --> 44:25.160
Kolte is the final word
on such matters.

44:26.920 --> 44:30.800
You should drop by sometimes.
All okay at home?

44:31.160 --> 44:32.240
Yes, sir.
Thank you.

44:32.320 --> 44:37.040
Tell me... how tough is it really?

44:37.280 --> 44:41.120
Tougher than stopping your transfer
to Bhoomarbavdi?

44:41.320 --> 44:46.800
Or tougher than shielding you
in the Majid Rana fake encounter case?

44:50.960 --> 44:54.600
Fine, sir... no worries.
I'll find the suitcase.

44:55.280 --> 45:01.400
Hey! Did you think
I was threatening you?

45:01.600 --> 45:02.920
You thought that, didn't you?

45:03.200 --> 45:05.400
It was just for comparison.

45:05.920 --> 45:10.440
Subhash, this is my problem.
I speak and people misunderstand me.

45:10.600 --> 45:13.800
I shouldn't say anything at all.
I should just be quiet.

45:13.920 --> 45:16.160
No, sir. I'll find it.

45:19.640 --> 45:23.720
Now when he is so determined,
who am I to stop him?

45:24.880 --> 45:32.440
One more thing. There's a file,
with some personal, important documents.

45:32.600 --> 45:35.880
My wife is emotionally attached to them.

45:36.800 --> 45:38.440
Will you get that as well?

45:38.840 --> 45:39.760
Yes, sir.

46:39.640 --> 46:41.000
Here's the deal, Faizu.

46:41.200 --> 46:43.440
We just have to find the suitcase.

46:44.040 --> 46:46.480
Pipe Road was the scene
of the crime.

46:47.080 --> 46:53.000
Let's start by cross-checking
Omar's story.

46:53.600 --> 46:55.680
Dig out information, will you?

46:55.960 --> 46:58.080
On it, sir.

46:59.120 --> 46:59.960
Here.

47:01.840 --> 47:03.880
-Thank you, sir.
-Keep your phone switched on.

47:04.080 --> 47:05.160
It's on, sir.

47:14.480 --> 47:17.280
Kolte sahab, the shootout
happened very late last night.

47:17.560 --> 47:21.480
There were no casualties either.
What report will we file?

47:22.360 --> 47:25.080
No, sir... an investigation is under way.

47:25.520 --> 47:30.160
But sir, you know the system.
There's already such a massive backlog.

47:30.880 --> 47:33.600
Alright, Kamble.
Let me know if you get a lead.

47:33.760 --> 47:37.400
Absolutely sir, if we get the CCTV footage
I'll share it.

47:37.760 --> 47:39.960
After all, we go way back.

47:40.360 --> 47:42.720
Alright, sir. Bye!

47:43.480 --> 47:45.840
You there! Come here.

47:48.320 --> 47:49.880
-Yes, you.
-Me?

47:57.000 --> 47:58.600
What's your name?

47:59.280 --> 48:00.640
Shy, are we? Look up.

48:00.920 --> 48:03.040
Nandan Kumar.

48:03.280 --> 48:04.800
Nandan Kumar?

48:06.520 --> 48:07.840
Is this your daily route?

48:08.320 --> 48:09.200
Yes, sir.

48:10.160 --> 48:11.960
What about last night?

48:12.800 --> 48:15.280
Yes, sir.
I passed by at 1.05 am.

48:15.360 --> 48:16.520
I'm a salaried person.

48:16.600 --> 48:19.320
I work at a printing press.
Here's my ID card, sir.

48:20.360 --> 48:21.360
There you go.

48:23.600 --> 48:24.520
Fine... go.

48:28.840 --> 48:31.560
But, sir... what happened here?

48:33.240 --> 48:35.600
There was a shootout.

48:37.320 --> 48:42.320
Shootout? You must have got
the footage on the CCTV?

48:42.680 --> 48:44.360
If only the damn thing worked.

48:45.400 --> 48:47.600
Oh, the damn thing doesn't work?

48:49.440 --> 48:52.200
I mean... it should, shouldn't it.
How can CCTVs...

48:52.400 --> 48:56.800
Kamble sir, this one's working.
The one by the traffic signal is broken.

48:58.320 --> 49:00.840
No, no. This camera isn't working.

49:01.000 --> 49:02.200
Neither is the other one.

49:02.240 --> 49:03.840
What's the point having them?

49:04.240 --> 49:07.600
What a shame!
None of the cameras are working?

49:07.680 --> 49:09.520
While you guys are working all night.

49:09.920 --> 49:13.720
Sometimes, I feel so terrible for you...

49:13.840 --> 49:17.040
Hey... scram!

52:04.160 --> 52:06.000
And... any leads yet?

52:06.280 --> 52:07.480
Been at it, sir.

52:07.560 --> 52:09.760
I'm doing the rounds with
my informants on the street.

52:10.040 --> 52:11.560
In my opinion, it could be a small gang.

52:11.640 --> 52:13.080
Let's just stick to facts, Faizu.

52:13.320 --> 52:14.480
Absolutely, sir!

52:14.560 --> 52:16.920
One thing is for sure.
Omar isn't lying.

52:17.160 --> 52:19.800
His story is adding up.
He's put his boys on the job, too.

52:20.520 --> 52:23.360
Okay. Meet me at Pipe road junction
right now.

52:25.120 --> 52:28.320
Faizu? The name rings a bell.

52:29.960 --> 52:31.600
Graduate, who does he work for?

52:31.720 --> 52:33.120
Inspector Kolte.

52:34.480 --> 52:35.640
How do you know?

52:35.960 --> 52:37.480
They are right in front of me.

52:39.160 --> 52:42.680
Ah, I see! Patil is panicking.
So he summoned his favourite errand boy.

52:43.120 --> 52:45.120
Kolte doesn't work for anyone else.

52:46.120 --> 52:47.480
A boon in disguise.

52:48.080 --> 52:50.080
Kolte won't rest
till he finds the suitcase.

52:50.520 --> 52:52.720
All you need to do is tail him.

52:53.080 --> 52:54.280
Yes, boss.

52:54.600 --> 52:57.080
You'll need to turn into a Remora.

52:57.680 --> 52:59.400
Turn into what, sir?

53:00.240 --> 53:02.120
When will you start your subscription?

53:02.400 --> 53:03.960
I've already informed the cable guy.

53:04.080 --> 53:05.520
They'll start Nat Geo by Monday.

53:05.920 --> 53:07.520
Your Monday's been coming
for two years.

53:09.240 --> 53:10.840
Listen!

53:14.360 --> 53:22.760
Remora aka Sucker-fish.
Swims sticking to the shark's belly.

53:23.720 --> 53:29.920
The shark does the hard hunting.
The Remora eats for free.

53:31.320 --> 53:33.840
Stick to Kolte like a Remora.

53:34.800 --> 53:37.120
He'll find the suitcase for us.

53:38.960 --> 53:40.120
Remora.

53:40.400 --> 53:41.240
Yes.

53:43.960 --> 53:45.160
What did he say?

53:45.960 --> 53:47.040
Become a Remora.

53:47.200 --> 53:48.080
What?

53:48.640 --> 53:49.520
Remora!

53:54.080 --> 53:56.520
Give me the suitcase!

53:56.600 --> 53:57.720
What suitcase?

53:58.120 --> 54:01.200
I can't make head or tail of it.

54:01.560 --> 54:04.800
I've left no stone unturned, sir.

54:05.360 --> 54:07.080
My boys are combing every
square inch of the streets.

54:07.200 --> 54:08.760
Have I ever failed you?

54:08.960 --> 54:10.640
-I was born in this neighborhood...
-Faizu!

54:11.240 --> 54:13.320
I don't have time for stories.

54:14.600 --> 54:15.920
I need information. Now!

54:22.440 --> 54:24.680
I think there's a new player in town.

54:32.480 --> 54:35.680
I want to see the Super Manav movie!

54:35.760 --> 54:38.280
Aayush, aren't we going
to the beach after this.

54:38.400 --> 54:40.560
-You can play to your heart's content.
-What's going on?

54:40.640 --> 54:42.480
I want to see Super Manav.

54:42.680 --> 54:44.600
-Unnecessary expenses.
-I want to see it now!

54:44.800 --> 54:47.920
I'll never ask for anything
for the rest of my life!

54:48.080 --> 54:51.920
-Aayush!
-Alright. Let's all watch Super Manav.

54:52.560 --> 54:54.800
What is the big fuss?
Let him have a good time, too.

54:55.080 --> 54:57.160
You're spending a lot these days?

54:57.760 --> 55:03.000
Don't worry about the money.
I have a friend... Joy Bagman.

55:03.120 --> 55:06.120
He's got connections here.
In fact, we'll get free tickets.

55:06.200 --> 55:07.680
Absolutely free.

55:08.520 --> 55:09.800
-Free?
-Yeah, yeah, free.

55:09.920 --> 55:11.600
Everything's free.
Come on. Don't worry.

55:11.680 --> 55:13.120
Free popcorn? Bring it on!

55:13.240 --> 55:14.800
Yes, yes, why not?

55:19.360 --> 55:21.760
It's true, I was born on Planet Nexon.

55:22.000 --> 55:25.520
But ever since I landed here,
Earth has nurtured me like a mother.

55:25.720 --> 55:30.800
And by this Motherland, I solemnly swear
should the forces of evil ever come near

55:30.920 --> 55:33.240
have no fear,
cause you can count on

55:33.320 --> 55:35.080
Super Manav!

55:36.240 --> 55:37.640
Kill him like a mangy dog.

55:47.120 --> 55:48.280
Hey...

55:48.920 --> 55:49.760
What?

55:50.600 --> 55:52.760
Are you seriously into this kiddy film?

55:54.280 --> 55:55.720
Go away!

55:57.480 --> 56:00.080
After this let's go straight for Chinese?

56:00.920 --> 56:01.800
Why not?

56:01.920 --> 56:04.280
We'll roam some more,
and go home later.

56:05.560 --> 56:06.600
Why later?

56:07.400 --> 56:10.280
I've asked Balu to clean the house.

56:11.000 --> 56:14.200
That goof ball will get done in no time.
So why go home late?

56:14.560 --> 56:17.800
He'll clean Ramlal-ji's house first.
Then ours. It'll take him a while.

56:18.240 --> 56:20.880
Oh, Ramlal-ji's house.

56:21.120 --> 56:23.960
What?
Who gave him the keys?

56:24.520 --> 56:26.240
I did. This morning.

56:26.360 --> 56:28.360
The keys? Why?

56:28.560 --> 56:31.680
Why bother cleaning Ramlal-ji's house?

56:32.000 --> 56:34.400
Why bother?
He's our neighbor.

56:35.200 --> 56:36.320
What the hell!

56:36.560 --> 56:39.880
Never offered him a cup of tea.
Suddenly, he's our neighbor?

57:15.640 --> 57:16.400
Hello?

57:16.680 --> 57:18.120
What? Accident!

57:19.040 --> 57:20.200
I'm coming!

57:20.800 --> 57:22.880
I have to go.
My friend has met with an accident.

57:23.000 --> 57:24.280
-Who?
-Him.

57:24.520 --> 57:25.880
-Who?
-The same fellow.

57:26.000 --> 57:27.800
-What?
-Let me explain.

57:28.240 --> 57:30.240
My friend's been in an accident.
It's an emergency.

57:30.320 --> 57:32.040
The doctor said that he needs
RH negative blood.

57:32.160 --> 57:35.560
Now RH negative is rare.
But we have to stay positive, isn't it?

57:35.640 --> 57:37.320
'Cause you have to be positive
for negative blood.

57:37.440 --> 57:39.480
And for positive blood,
you have to be positive, too.

57:39.560 --> 57:42.800
If not, negativity will creep in
and he'll die.

57:42.920 --> 57:45.160
Fine. Go. But, come back quickly.

57:45.280 --> 57:46.040
Okay.

57:46.160 --> 57:47.320
Who is the friend?

57:47.520 --> 57:49.400
I haven't thought that through.

57:49.760 --> 57:53.840
Super Manav, please let me go!
No, no... argh!

58:21.600 --> 58:22.360
Balu!

58:24.760 --> 58:26.600
What are you doing?

58:27.000 --> 58:31.160
Sorry, sir. You scared me.
I spilled water all over.

58:31.320 --> 58:35.640
Never mind. I'll manage Ramlal's house.

58:35.800 --> 58:37.480
Please clean my house first.

58:37.560 --> 58:39.920
That's very kind of you.
But this is my job.

58:40.080 --> 58:42.920
You clean my house quickly.
Lata will arrive any minute.

58:43.040 --> 58:46.560
Today's our anniversary.
So, please hurry up.

58:47.080 --> 58:48.400
Anniv... what?

58:48.640 --> 58:50.880
Our wedding's birthday!

58:55.160 --> 58:56.960
Happy birthday!

58:57.600 --> 58:59.520
Thanks. Now hurry.

59:00.680 --> 59:01.440
Good boy.

59:03.400 --> 59:04.400
Thank you.

59:07.280 --> 59:09.280
Joy Bagman.

59:11.080 --> 59:16.120
Joy Bagman, what do I do with you?

59:17.520 --> 59:20.560
Took a bullet from the wife
trying to save you.

59:22.240 --> 59:25.600
You're happily unmarried,
you won't understand.

59:27.200 --> 59:31.440
Say something... thank you...
sorry... anything.

59:35.760 --> 59:36.680
Never mind.

59:37.880 --> 59:40.360
I'll take your silence for an apology.

59:42.320 --> 59:45.560
But Joy, this won't do.

59:46.160 --> 59:48.160
We've got to do something.

59:48.400 --> 59:51.640
You're so fat you are visible
from the moon.

59:53.720 --> 59:57.800
First of all, let's shed some weight,
shall we?

59:59.360 --> 1:00:00.760
What do you say?

1:00:03.320 --> 1:00:05.160
Let's hide one part
behind the refrigerator.

1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:08.000
No! Lata might easily spot it.

1:00:08.760 --> 1:00:10.520
How about we place you up high?

1:00:10.640 --> 1:00:12.120
Lata has back trouble.

1:00:13.400 --> 1:00:16.240
One part in old clothes,
one in the kitchen.

1:00:17.400 --> 1:00:19.800
One part in the trunk that opens
only during Diwali.

1:00:20.760 --> 1:00:22.480
Behind God's photograph.

1:00:22.880 --> 1:00:25.720
In God we trust.
Leave it to Him!

1:00:29.160 --> 1:00:32.320
Focus, Mr Bagman.

1:00:33.280 --> 1:00:36.520
It's not the time to eat Chinese.
It's time to scale the Great Wall.

1:00:37.240 --> 1:00:40.040
Some behind father, grandmother.

1:00:41.040 --> 1:00:43.080
There's no success without
the blessings of the elders.

1:00:44.160 --> 1:00:45.760
One in the water tank.

1:00:46.120 --> 1:00:48.440
We'll deal with the rest
before Ramlal returns.

1:00:48.760 --> 1:00:53.360
Great... now you're feeling lighter
and so am I.

1:00:55.800 --> 1:00:56.680
Cheers!

1:01:11.560 --> 1:01:12.600
Victory to India, Patil sahab!

1:01:12.720 --> 1:01:15.360
Kolte! What news of the suitcase?

1:01:15.920 --> 1:01:17.480
Sir... I'm on it.

1:01:19.160 --> 1:01:22.000
Are you eating?
Should I call later?

1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:24.480
No, no, sir. We can speak.

1:01:24.640 --> 1:01:27.880
What is left to speak?
I've lost my appetite.

1:01:28.200 --> 1:01:32.640
Can a man worried
about the suitcase feel hungry?

1:01:37.080 --> 1:01:39.160
Kolte? What happened?

1:01:40.160 --> 1:01:42.640
I definitely didn't mean
that you're eating

1:01:42.720 --> 1:01:44.440
because you aren't worried
about the suitcase.

1:01:44.680 --> 1:01:48.440
Please eat.
Sorry, I disturbed you. Okay.

1:01:55.520 --> 1:01:57.800
Pass the carrot cake here too.

1:02:05.240 --> 1:02:06.720
-Faizu.
-Yes, sir.

1:02:06.800 --> 1:02:07.840
-Listen.
-Yes, sir.

1:02:07.960 --> 1:02:10.760
The CCTV at Pipe Road
isn't working.

1:02:11.360 --> 1:02:14.240
Neither is this inquiry a priority
for the department.

1:02:14.720 --> 1:02:15.960
Let's do one thing.

1:02:16.080 --> 1:02:18.680
List out all the shops
in that locality with CCTV cameras.

1:02:19.280 --> 1:02:21.200
I'll get the footage
from the shopkeepers.

1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:22.320
Okay, sir.

1:02:22.560 --> 1:02:23.320
Okay.

1:02:38.680 --> 1:02:40.120
-Nandan.
-Yes, sir!

1:02:41.040 --> 1:02:42.720
What happened?

1:02:45.520 --> 1:02:48.280
-You lucky son of a gun.
-Why, sir?

1:02:48.400 --> 1:02:53.080
You've been nominated
for 'Kirodimal Employee of the Year'.

1:02:53.440 --> 1:02:57.360
If you win, you take home 7000 rupees.
How much?

1:02:57.480 --> 1:03:00.000
-7000.
-7000!

1:03:00.200 --> 1:03:02.120
And one hell of a shiny trophy.

1:03:02.440 --> 1:03:05.280
-Fantastic. Keep it up.
-Thank you, sir.

1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:23.760
Hello?

1:03:23.880 --> 1:03:25.680
What's for dinner?

1:03:26.240 --> 1:03:27.440
I haven't decided.

1:03:27.600 --> 1:03:29.520
I'm fine with leftovers from lunch.

1:03:30.200 --> 1:03:32.800
You can warm it up
in your new oven.

1:03:32.920 --> 1:03:33.760
What?

1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:46.360
-An oven for the lady.
-What's this?

1:03:46.880 --> 1:03:50.080
Warms the food and cools the mind.

1:03:50.440 --> 1:03:52.920
Oven? Is it ours?

1:03:53.040 --> 1:03:54.120
Who else's?

1:03:54.440 --> 1:03:55.680
Such a big one.

1:03:58.920 --> 1:04:00.040
Wow!

1:04:04.640 --> 1:04:06.200
Where did you get the money?

1:04:06.480 --> 1:04:08.000
Oh, I have a friend.

1:04:08.240 --> 1:04:09.920
He's got connections
at the electronic store.

1:04:10.120 --> 1:04:11.600
Which friend? Joy?

1:04:11.680 --> 1:04:16.480
Yes. Joy Bagman.
60 percent off with easy installments.

1:04:16.920 --> 1:04:18.760
I was thinking of getting
an air conditioner, too.

1:04:19.000 --> 1:04:20.440
Is he a new friend?

1:04:20.800 --> 1:04:23.000
I've been hearing a lot
about him of late.

1:04:23.640 --> 1:04:25.160
Call him over for dinner sometime.

1:04:25.680 --> 1:04:30.600
He's a childhood friend.
Sure, we'll invite him for dinner.

1:04:30.920 --> 1:04:33.320
Not just dinner, I was thinking...
Aayush is here.

1:04:33.640 --> 1:04:36.840
Aayush, come here.
Look what I've got for you.

1:04:38.360 --> 1:04:41.400
Yay! A Super Manav bag.

1:04:41.600 --> 1:04:42.920
Wait a second.

1:04:43.280 --> 1:04:46.280
Where's the water bottle, snack box
and other goodies that come with it?

1:04:46.360 --> 1:04:48.720
Aayush, be happy with what dad got you.
What does grandpa say?

1:04:48.800 --> 1:04:51.920
Hold on... I'll handle him.
Won't you get me a cup of tea?

1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:53.760
Please.

1:04:55.960 --> 1:04:57.080
Come here.

1:04:58.480 --> 1:05:00.960
So, you want the rest of the set too?

1:05:01.880 --> 1:05:04.680
Give me some time.
Papa will get you everything.

1:05:05.120 --> 1:05:09.480
First, we'll get a big new TV,
an AC, a car.

1:05:09.760 --> 1:05:14.200
We'll go to Shimla and have a blast.
Happy?

1:05:20.440 --> 1:05:24.560
Where do I begin, I'm speechless.
All I can say is...

1:05:25.320 --> 1:05:26.160
Thank you.

1:05:26.360 --> 1:05:27.600
Everyone, please sit down.

1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:30.720
This award is not just an award.
Then what is it?

1:05:31.520 --> 1:05:33.360
It is a victory of hard work
and honesty.

1:05:33.480 --> 1:05:35.680
Aren't you getting your award today?

1:05:36.320 --> 1:05:38.920
Award? What award?

1:05:39.400 --> 1:05:40.880
Best employee.

1:05:41.560 --> 1:05:45.120
Let me get it first.
Don't jinx it.

1:05:46.000 --> 1:05:48.480
Papa's going to win an award!

1:05:48.560 --> 1:05:50.760
-Aayush!
-Boys!

1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:53.240
-Papa's going to win!
-Now I had better win it.

1:05:54.800 --> 1:05:58.320
You will win for sure.
Considering all the night duty you do?

1:05:58.880 --> 1:06:02.240
And if you win 7000 rupees.

1:06:02.920 --> 1:06:04.040
Then...

1:06:04.760 --> 1:06:05.640
Then?

1:06:06.080 --> 1:06:07.280
Then...

1:06:08.120 --> 1:06:08.920
Then?

1:06:09.200 --> 1:06:12.720
Then bring it home.
Don't give it to sister Binu!

1:06:13.360 --> 1:06:15.440
What's your problem
with sister Binu?

1:06:15.520 --> 1:06:16.960
Did she steal your dad's kidney?

1:06:17.080 --> 1:06:20.280
Papa, there's also a party in the building
tonight... let's bring the roof down!

1:06:20.360 --> 1:06:22.440
-What party?
-It's Mukesh's birthday!

1:06:22.600 --> 1:06:23.320
Oh? That's tonight?

1:06:23.560 --> 1:06:25.400
Sweet!

1:06:25.560 --> 1:06:27.080
Come, let's check your homework.

1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:00.000
What happened?

1:07:00.120 --> 1:07:01.800
Nothing... just a blockage.
It's cleared now.

1:07:03.440 --> 1:07:04.880
I'll see who it is.

1:07:07.040 --> 1:07:07.920
Keys, please.

1:07:11.360 --> 1:07:13.040
Nandan-ji, my house keys.

1:07:13.840 --> 1:07:19.320
Keys? I wasn't expecting you
till next week. How come you're early?

1:07:19.520 --> 1:07:21.920
Wrapped up my work early,
so I came back.

1:07:22.320 --> 1:07:26.840
Work, work, work.
Work is temporary, family is forever.

1:07:26.960 --> 1:07:29.640
Shouldn't you have spent
more time with them?

1:07:29.760 --> 1:07:32.360
-Instead, here you are.
-Keys to my house, please.

1:07:33.000 --> 1:07:36.640
Keys to... keys to... to... two keys
You should've had two keys

1:07:36.760 --> 1:07:39.040
The original one's lost.

1:07:39.120 --> 1:07:43.120
Nonsense! It was in your pocket last night.
Namaste. We've cleaned your house.

1:07:43.720 --> 1:07:46.800
True! I did have it last night.
I lost it in the morning.

1:07:46.880 --> 1:07:51.200
In the morning, it fell in the toilet!
It fell in the toilet. Sorry.

1:07:51.480 --> 1:07:52.880
In the toilet?

1:07:54.280 --> 1:07:56.040
Ramlal-ji, what's done is done.

1:07:56.360 --> 1:07:57.680
We'll have to make another.

1:07:57.880 --> 1:08:01.440
Please catch the key-maker
before he leaves for lunch.

1:08:02.360 --> 1:08:05.920
What were you doing with my keys
in the toilet?

1:08:06.480 --> 1:08:08.200
I haven't thought that through.

1:08:54.240 --> 1:08:57.120
Ramlal-ji, I found your key!

1:08:57.560 --> 1:09:00.640
I put my hand in the toilet
and fished it out. Here...

1:09:00.760 --> 1:09:05.280
No, thank you. Now that he's here
I'll get a duplicate made. Keep it.

1:09:05.440 --> 1:09:06.880
-Are you sure?
-Absolutely.

1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:08.040
Fine.

1:09:32.560 --> 1:09:35.160
Why?

1:09:35.880 --> 1:09:38.160
O why?

1:09:38.480 --> 1:09:40.960
Why, O why?

1:09:41.240 --> 1:09:43.480
Why?

1:09:44.520 --> 1:09:49.080
Why have the nights turned foe?

1:09:53.320 --> 1:10:01.000
O night, why this hostility?

1:10:04.560 --> 1:10:05.720
What is it?

1:10:06.320 --> 1:10:09.480
Do I look like the mailman?
I forgot my purse. Open up.

1:10:09.640 --> 1:10:11.560
-Why haven't you showered?
-I will, I will...

1:10:11.800 --> 1:10:14.600
-Have you seen my purse?
-It must be in this room.

1:10:15.200 --> 1:10:16.440
Where is it?

1:10:18.720 --> 1:10:19.800
Here it is.

1:10:25.040 --> 1:10:26.520
Whose money is this?

1:10:27.840 --> 1:10:31.920
Lata, I was about to tell you.
I...

1:10:32.800 --> 1:10:36.920
150 rupees.
How careless of you!

1:10:37.400 --> 1:10:41.880
I was looking for it.
Thanks.

1:10:42.080 --> 1:10:43.680
And what is this wet towel doing here?

1:10:46.120 --> 1:10:49.240
You're looking hot like chicken chilly.

1:10:49.840 --> 1:10:51.320
Stop it!

1:10:52.320 --> 1:10:55.040
O hostile night.

1:10:58.040 --> 1:10:59.680
Fantastic!

1:10:59.960 --> 1:11:03.160
Indeed, when love departs,
even the nights turn hostile

1:11:03.320 --> 1:11:06.040
Moving on to our next employee's talent.

1:11:17.880 --> 1:11:18.800
Bravo!

1:11:35.040 --> 1:11:38.200
O walnut, why are thee so tough?

1:11:38.840 --> 1:11:43.360
Does your resilient exterior
protect a fragile ego?

1:11:43.640 --> 1:11:48.040
Is it a reflection of society's brutality?

1:11:48.240 --> 1:11:54.160
Shake society up, O walnut...

1:12:05.120 --> 1:12:11.320
I now request our chief guest
Mr. Vasanth Goenka to come on stage

1:12:11.400 --> 1:12:16.440
and award the 'Kirodimal Employee
of the Year' trophy to the winner.

1:12:17.520 --> 1:12:19.800
The employee of the year is...

1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:43.400
I was trying to call you
but there's no network.

1:12:46.320 --> 1:12:47.200
Give it.

1:12:48.360 --> 1:12:49.600
Congratulations.

1:12:50.120 --> 1:12:52.800
I was waiting for you
but you never came.

1:13:06.440 --> 1:13:08.120
Nandan, congrats!

1:13:35.440 --> 1:13:37.360
What... no party?

1:13:38.440 --> 1:13:40.160
Mukesh isn't here either.

1:13:42.400 --> 1:13:43.440
Mukesh?

1:13:43.960 --> 1:13:48.280
No, Nandan-ji. He's coming.
The party's also on.

1:13:49.360 --> 1:13:51.080
Minus the alcohol.

1:13:52.160 --> 1:13:53.520
-Mocktail.
-What?

1:13:55.920 --> 1:13:58.760
Hello... today is a holy day,
Lots of us are fasting.

1:13:59.040 --> 1:14:02.880
So no alcohol, and no meat.
It's gotta be a holy party!

1:14:03.000 --> 1:14:04.480
That's right.

1:14:05.200 --> 1:14:07.600
All thanks to your wife.

1:16:15.400 --> 1:16:16.440
Mukesh!

1:16:31.400 --> 1:16:32.720
Wow, Mukesh!
2,000 rupee notes?

1:17:06.360 --> 1:17:11.280
Mukesh, tell me...
isn't it your birthday?

1:17:11.560 --> 1:17:14.960
Who were we singing about?

1:17:15.160 --> 1:17:16.240
Huh?

1:17:16.440 --> 1:17:20.320
Pa-Pa Praveen Tripathi?

1:17:30.760 --> 1:17:36.880
Sir, look... the CCTV footage
from Vidya Jewelers.

1:17:41.080 --> 1:17:44.520
Who is that?
Which gang is he from?

1:17:44.720 --> 1:17:45.920
Replay it.

1:17:50.040 --> 1:17:52.240
Didn't I tell you,
there's a new player in town.

1:17:53.320 --> 1:17:58.520
What's he holding?
A bag, an umbrella and a tiffin box.

1:17:59.160 --> 1:18:00.960
Looks like the average Joe!

1:18:01.640 --> 1:18:04.360
Don't have a clear view
of the rickshaw driver either.

1:18:04.600 --> 1:18:07.040
They could even be partners.

1:18:07.720 --> 1:18:10.400
Look, can you see
the license plate?

1:18:10.480 --> 1:18:13.080
If we can nab this driver
we'll nail him, too.

1:18:13.240 --> 1:18:17.560
8-0-8-0. No... 1-9-8-0.

1:18:17.640 --> 1:18:20.000
Zoom in.

1:18:20.600 --> 1:18:23.920
Nine... eight...

1:18:24.880 --> 1:18:26.080
It's too hazy.

1:18:26.240 --> 1:18:29.000
Look, it could be any of these numbers.

1:18:29.440 --> 1:18:33.600
Let's narrow it down
to rickshaw license plates.

1:18:34.040 --> 1:18:37.400
-Line up the drivers.
-Got it.

1:18:37.480 --> 1:18:39.720
Now we are talking!

1:18:47.080 --> 1:18:48.240
Fancy a drink?

1:18:48.320 --> 1:18:50.360
No, sir.
How can I drink with you?

1:18:50.440 --> 1:18:53.920
We are ranks apart.
I wouldn't dare.

1:18:54.040 --> 1:18:55.520
You're a cop...
I'm just an informer.

1:18:55.600 --> 1:18:57.320
-Yes or no?
-Yes, of course!

1:18:58.560 --> 1:19:01.320
Get the vodka bottle
from behind the shelf.

1:19:02.080 --> 1:19:04.320
I drink every night, sir.

1:19:08.080 --> 1:19:11.560
Joy Bagman, there's just one problem.

1:19:12.640 --> 1:19:15.800
Money, money everywhere
but not a penny can I spend!

1:19:16.320 --> 1:19:20.680
I have to lie
to buy gifts for Aayush and Lata.

1:19:21.720 --> 1:19:25.880
If they learn about you,
we'll both get kicked out.

1:19:26.720 --> 1:19:28.720
Gods are her relatives.

1:19:29.040 --> 1:19:34.400
A priest's daughter, after all.
She hates black money!

1:19:34.760 --> 1:19:37.520
Me? I don't discriminate.

1:19:38.920 --> 1:19:42.440
And I bet, this money doesn't
belong to a poor man.

1:19:43.200 --> 1:19:44.800
So how is it a sin?

1:19:46.400 --> 1:19:51.080
Joy, we need to think big.

1:19:56.160 --> 1:19:59.000
Alright, let's make this quick.
I don't have all day. I'm on duty.

1:20:00.240 --> 1:20:03.680
14th? That was my birthday!

1:20:04.080 --> 1:20:04.840
So?

1:20:05.040 --> 1:20:06.400
So I was home, sir.

1:20:06.720 --> 1:20:09.160
I didn't do anything, sir.

1:20:09.600 --> 1:20:14.000
That night I was in Chandivali,
no... Kandivali.

1:20:14.240 --> 1:20:17.560
It's true, I used be a chain snatcher, sir.
But, now I'm clean.

1:20:17.640 --> 1:20:20.000
I've turned over a new leaf.

1:20:20.720 --> 1:20:21.600
I swear on God!

1:20:22.000 --> 1:20:23.760
And these are God given gifts?

1:20:28.440 --> 1:20:29.600
You asked to see me, sir?

1:20:29.800 --> 1:20:30.600
Yes.

1:20:31.720 --> 1:20:32.880
Where were you?

1:20:33.080 --> 1:20:34.320
Sir, I'd gone to my village.

1:20:34.440 --> 1:20:37.000
Does it take so long to return?

1:20:37.360 --> 1:20:38.560
Where's your village?

1:20:38.840 --> 1:20:41.320
Bhoomarbawdi. It's very far, sir.

1:20:45.920 --> 1:20:48.600
-Name?
-Keshav Prajapati.

1:20:49.120 --> 1:20:52.040
14th night, at 2 am
where were you, Prajapati?

1:20:53.440 --> 1:20:54.640
2 am...

1:20:55.600 --> 1:20:57.440
Let me jog your memory.

1:20:57.680 --> 1:21:02.120
You were on Pipe Road helping
your partner-in-crime move stolen money.

1:21:02.240 --> 1:21:05.360
-Robbery?
-Sit. Look carefully.

1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:07.600
Isn't this your rickshaw?

1:21:08.680 --> 1:21:10.200
Yes, sir.

1:21:10.320 --> 1:21:11.520
And?

1:21:12.680 --> 1:21:16.000
I remember...
The guy seemed fishy.

1:21:16.240 --> 1:21:20.160
I saw the suitcase and asked
if there was a body in it.

1:21:20.280 --> 1:21:22.160
-What?
-It felt that heavy, sir.

1:21:32.600 --> 1:21:34.600
Welcome to Kamania Residency.

1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:37.480
India's number one real estate company.

1:21:38.120 --> 1:21:40.560
-Hello, madam. I...
-For English, press one.

1:21:41.080 --> 1:21:44.840
For Hindi, press two.
For Marathi, press three.

1:21:50.040 --> 1:21:53.720
Sorry all our customer executives
are busy at the moment.

1:21:54.120 --> 1:21:55.440
Please call after...

1:22:03.760 --> 1:22:05.240
Welcome to Chaddha Galaxy.

1:22:08.440 --> 1:22:10.040
Hello...

1:22:10.680 --> 1:22:11.800
-Hello.
-Hello.

1:22:12.040 --> 1:22:16.120
Hello! Can I schedule a visit
to see the property on Sunday?

1:22:16.240 --> 1:22:20.120
Sure, sir. But, please could you share
your contact details first.

1:22:20.240 --> 1:22:21.640
-Yes, of course.
-Go ahead.

1:22:21.720 --> 1:22:26.920
One vegetable biryani, two portions rice,
one buttermilk and one poppadum.

1:22:27.040 --> 1:22:29.560
-Hello!
-For dessert, 200 grams of your best.

1:22:29.640 --> 1:22:31.480
-Sir!
-Please hurry, I'm starving.

1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:36.880
Sir, I dropped him here.

1:22:37.160 --> 1:22:39.720
From here he must have gone
somewhere close by.

1:22:40.520 --> 1:22:42.200
Where does this road go?

1:22:42.480 --> 1:22:44.760
This one leads to the main road.
And there's a fish market to the left.

1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:46.320
Do you remember his face?

1:22:46.480 --> 1:22:48.840
Yes, kind of.

1:22:49.760 --> 1:22:51.760
We should get a sketch done quickly.

1:22:53.120 --> 1:22:56.120
Sir, my drawing sucks.

1:22:58.840 --> 1:23:01.920
Are you high?
Why will you draw?

1:23:02.400 --> 1:23:03.920
There are artists that do this.

1:23:05.520 --> 1:23:08.000
Now buzz off.
Come see me tomorrow.

1:23:09.680 --> 1:23:11.000
Fool!

1:23:13.320 --> 1:23:16.680
Faizu, check the neighbourhood.

1:23:17.560 --> 1:23:21.200
Start with the shops.
Look for CCTV cameras.

1:23:33.720 --> 1:23:36.520
So, Mr. Nandan Kumar,
you own a printing press?

1:23:36.640 --> 1:23:38.320
Printing press in Bhandup West .

1:23:38.440 --> 1:23:39.720
Ah, Budapest!

1:23:40.040 --> 1:23:42.320
Just outstanding, sir.
That's a perfect match.

1:23:42.680 --> 1:23:43.960
Allow me to explain, sir.

1:23:44.360 --> 1:23:48.360
When you invest in a property here,
you don't get a flat.

1:23:49.760 --> 1:23:52.320
Sir, it's an experience you're buying into.

1:23:52.440 --> 1:23:56.480
Podium level parking
for your Mercedes or BM...

1:23:56.600 --> 1:23:57.320
W?

1:23:57.440 --> 1:23:59.480
You look like the Beamer type.

1:23:59.680 --> 1:24:02.160
Creme-de-la-creme neighbours...
who are business tycoons like you.

1:24:02.280 --> 1:24:05.800
Executive lounge where you can crack
the deal for your next printing press.

1:24:06.080 --> 1:24:09.000
Gymnasium, swimming pool with a jacuzzi
to rejuvenate you.

1:24:09.120 --> 1:24:11.920
Cards room, billiards room and
a mini golf course, which is a must, sir!

1:24:12.040 --> 1:24:12.800
-Of course.
-Isn't it?

1:24:12.920 --> 1:24:14.800
Should we go and see
a sample flat then, sir?

1:24:14.920 --> 1:24:16.840
-Yes.
-After you.

1:25:12.440 --> 1:25:14.880
Shall we discuss commercials, sir?

1:25:15.480 --> 1:25:16.920
Commercials?

1:25:17.280 --> 1:25:19.160
-Payment terms?
-Yes, payment!

1:25:20.520 --> 1:25:24.520
Sir, we have a 20-80 scheme.
20 percent upfront and rest 80, loan...

1:25:25.400 --> 1:25:26.720
which I don't think you will need.

1:25:26.800 --> 1:25:29.240
So, the 20 percent can be paid
to us directly via...

1:25:29.360 --> 1:25:30.400
Cash!

1:25:33.280 --> 1:25:35.160
Which you won't accept.

1:25:36.000 --> 1:25:41.640
And the rest of the 80 percent...
you won't accept in cash either.

1:25:42.240 --> 1:25:43.280
Right, sir.

1:25:43.720 --> 1:25:46.880
Then what am I doing here?
Where's the way out?

1:25:50.080 --> 1:25:53.880
Prince Bagman...
what good is it having you?

1:25:54.240 --> 1:25:57.880
Can't buy laxative worth 40 bucks
nor a luxury apartment worth 40 million.

1:25:58.080 --> 1:26:01.800
And even if I did buy the apartment,
what was I going to tell Lata?

1:26:01.960 --> 1:26:06.600
I am the one that's going crazy.
While you sit here and gloat.

1:26:07.000 --> 1:26:11.320
What are you doing?
Turning brass into gold?

1:26:24.800 --> 1:26:28.360
Sir, 100 percent sure.
He looks nothing like this.

1:26:30.320 --> 1:26:32.720
Sir, I drew it exactly as he told me.

1:26:33.200 --> 1:26:38.240
Sir, I think his drawing sucks too.

1:26:41.240 --> 1:26:42.360
You think this is funny?

1:26:42.440 --> 1:26:45.520
No, sir.
I remembered something.

1:26:45.600 --> 1:26:48.000
I remember.
I remember it all now.

1:26:48.440 --> 1:26:50.600
Sir, as he took out
the money to pay me,

1:26:50.680 --> 1:26:52.720
he dropped a bank card.

1:26:53.840 --> 1:26:55.720
Did you read the name on it?

1:26:56.120 --> 1:26:57.600
I don't remember the name.

1:26:57.680 --> 1:27:00.400
But there was... Bank India
or India Bank... written.

1:27:00.600 --> 1:27:03.080
It had the word 'India' on it.

1:27:08.960 --> 1:27:11.200
Okay, now beat it.

1:27:11.920 --> 1:27:13.240
Stop!

1:27:14.640 --> 1:27:16.720
Don't leave town.

1:27:17.440 --> 1:27:20.000
Sir, I'm an auto rickshaw driver.

1:27:20.400 --> 1:27:22.480
Legally, I cannot go beyond city limits.

1:27:29.080 --> 1:27:34.520
Sir, there are no CCTV cameras
on that lane.

1:27:37.800 --> 1:27:42.360
We'll have to check all the banks within
a 4 km radius of Azad Nagar

1:27:42.720 --> 1:27:44.960
that has 'India' in its name.

1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:50.320
Have you or your staff noticed
any strange behaviour in any customer?

1:27:50.680 --> 1:27:54.320
A recurrent cash deposit
of 10-20 grand?

1:27:54.720 --> 1:28:00.800
Especially large bills
with the same serial number.

1:28:01.320 --> 1:28:03.880
Or a request for extra lockers?

1:28:04.120 --> 1:28:07.560
Or any customer
behaving suspiciously?

1:28:08.400 --> 1:28:09.760
Please try and recall.

1:28:11.040 --> 1:28:12.920
Bank? Why now?

1:28:13.040 --> 1:28:15.200
Don't you know
it's the annual day at school?

1:28:15.480 --> 1:28:19.200
-I know. But, Mr. Vasant can't be trusted.
-What?

1:28:19.320 --> 1:28:21.160
What if the award cheque bounces?

1:28:21.360 --> 1:28:22.440
-Right, please.
-Don't worry.

1:28:22.600 --> 1:28:24.520
I'll wrap up the bank work
and come fast.

1:28:24.800 --> 1:28:27.080
The show starts in half hour. Hurry.

1:28:27.200 --> 1:28:28.360
Chill, I'll make it in time.

1:28:28.520 --> 1:28:30.240
Ridiculous!

1:28:35.560 --> 1:28:38.600
Mr. Dhumal isn't in today?
Is he on leave?

1:28:40.800 --> 1:28:43.040
Where can one get a machine like this?

1:28:45.120 --> 1:28:46.000
Why?

1:28:47.080 --> 1:28:50.280
There are two sacks full of cash at home,
I can't count it all.

1:29:10.680 --> 1:29:13.440
Two sacks full.
Look at me!

1:29:14.240 --> 1:29:15.800
Wait here.
I'll be back.

1:29:28.960 --> 1:29:31.520
Mr. Vashisht, are you aware

1:29:31.760 --> 1:29:35.080
we're throwing a surprise party
for Damle's birthday?

1:29:35.600 --> 1:29:39.240
Of course! The plan is to wait
till he gets to his seat.

1:29:39.360 --> 1:29:42.280
Sharma and I will sneak in from there
with the cake.

1:29:42.920 --> 1:29:45.160
Don't point.
Damle will see us.

1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:49.320
I've sent a reminder to everybody
on our Whatsapp group.

1:29:52.080 --> 1:29:55.160
Mr Damle, we're gonna smash cake
all over your face today.

1:29:56.600 --> 1:29:59.800
Sir, please wait!
Tiwari, stop him.

1:30:01.080 --> 1:30:02.320
Sir!

1:30:02.800 --> 1:30:04.560
Sir, please wait!

1:30:04.920 --> 1:30:05.840
Come back.

1:30:05.960 --> 1:30:07.040
I'll be back.

1:30:26.040 --> 1:30:27.240
What happened?

1:30:27.400 --> 1:30:31.080
Absolutely nothing.
You simply passed out, Nandan-ji.

1:30:31.440 --> 1:30:34.040
You were almost in an accident.
Here...

1:30:34.320 --> 1:30:38.160
I was trying to get your attention.
You forgot to take your deposit slip.

1:30:38.760 --> 1:30:39.920
Slip?

1:30:43.560 --> 1:30:44.800
Slip!

1:30:48.840 --> 1:30:49.760
Thank you.

1:30:52.200 --> 1:30:53.480
Take it easy.

1:30:58.440 --> 1:31:02.240
Lata... look, I really tried to make it.

1:31:02.640 --> 1:31:04.560
At least, tell me how the function was.

1:31:11.640 --> 1:31:13.320
Yes, I remember.

1:31:13.720 --> 1:31:16.600
There was a man like this.
Seemed suspicious.

1:31:17.160 --> 1:31:20.360
Can you describe him for me?
Any distinct features?

1:31:21.240 --> 1:31:22.800
Sir, he had...

1:31:25.240 --> 1:31:26.600
a mustache.

1:31:28.400 --> 1:31:29.480
Mustache?

1:31:30.360 --> 1:31:31.480
Mustache!

1:31:31.960 --> 1:31:33.000
Mustache?

1:31:33.240 --> 1:31:34.240
A mustache!

1:31:36.360 --> 1:31:38.760
How do you manage
to remember such fine details?

1:31:40.240 --> 1:31:41.360
Sir, there's a book...

1:31:41.440 --> 1:31:45.160
Observation by Association
by K.Y Vashisht. My father!

1:31:45.400 --> 1:31:47.760
There are many such techniques
prescribed in it.

1:31:47.840 --> 1:31:50.600
One more thing,
my mother used to feed me

1:31:50.720 --> 1:31:53.360
almonds rich in Omega 3, 6, 9
throughout my childhood.

1:31:53.800 --> 1:31:58.200
As a result my memory has improved
by approximately 27 percent.

1:31:58.440 --> 1:31:59.720
But just between you and I...

1:32:01.440 --> 1:32:03.960
When it comes to almonds,
always go for the Mamra variety.

1:32:04.360 --> 1:32:06.000
The rest of them are just...

1:32:06.120 --> 1:32:07.440
Shut up!

1:32:11.320 --> 1:32:13.880
Do you think a mustache
will help me find the guy?

1:32:14.240 --> 1:32:16.440
Rubbish!
Giving me useless information...

1:32:16.520 --> 1:32:19.320
association-disassociation,
nuts-guts, 3-9-6...

1:32:19.440 --> 1:32:21.000
Omega 3, 6, 9, sir.

1:32:21.240 --> 1:32:22.600
Shut up, fool!

1:32:25.480 --> 1:32:28.200
Just a minute... he's right, sir.

1:32:28.440 --> 1:32:30.840
I know this guy as well.

1:32:31.560 --> 1:32:36.680
He was a bit weird, sir.
First he inquired about a counting machine.

1:32:37.440 --> 1:32:40.520
Then all of a sudden,
he looked possessed

1:32:40.720 --> 1:32:42.240
and ran out of the bank.

1:32:43.080 --> 1:32:45.440
He even met with an accident.
Didn't he?

1:32:45.800 --> 1:32:46.920
Counting machine?

1:32:47.120 --> 1:32:47.920
Yes.

1:32:51.840 --> 1:32:54.680
Can you describe him for me?

1:32:54.960 --> 1:32:57.320
Even better, I can give you
his name and address.

1:32:57.400 --> 1:32:59.520
He banks with us.

1:32:59.840 --> 1:33:01.520
But what's this all about, sir?

1:33:04.880 --> 1:33:06.360
Stop.

1:33:07.920 --> 1:33:09.960
-How much?
-40.

1:33:11.920 --> 1:33:13.800
Got change for 100?

1:33:14.160 --> 1:33:17.000
No? Then give me a 50.

1:33:25.160 --> 1:33:29.280
If rickshaw drivers
don't have change then who will?

1:33:30.120 --> 1:33:31.840
You should've asked me.

1:33:32.160 --> 1:33:35.520
But no, I don't have change either.

1:33:36.720 --> 1:33:40.320
I have plenty of 2000 bills though!

1:33:45.400 --> 1:33:46.240
What's this?

1:33:46.400 --> 1:33:48.240
I should be asking you.
What's this?

1:33:48.640 --> 1:33:50.440
Isn't this what you were hiding from me?

1:33:50.840 --> 1:33:52.120
Why did you climb up?

1:33:52.200 --> 1:33:53.640
The doctor forbid you.

1:33:53.840 --> 1:33:55.720
I wanted to get things down.
I called Balu to help...

1:33:55.840 --> 1:33:57.000
that's when I found it.

1:33:57.120 --> 1:33:57.920
Balu?

1:33:59.960 --> 1:34:01.640
Balu saw it, too?

1:34:02.680 --> 1:34:05.320
I saw it.
What about that?

1:34:06.920 --> 1:34:07.960
Aayush... where's he?

1:34:08.120 --> 1:34:10.880
I've sent him to sister Binu's home.
Should he see this?

1:34:11.640 --> 1:34:14.720
Lata, I was about to tell you
about the suitcase...

1:34:14.840 --> 1:34:17.600
When? How long has it been
in my home?

1:34:17.760 --> 1:34:20.600
Why is it here?
Where has it come from?

1:34:20.720 --> 1:34:22.480
I found it on the road.

1:34:22.720 --> 1:34:25.160
On the road?
You don't know whose it is?

1:34:25.360 --> 1:34:27.360
-Have you stolen it?
-Listen...

1:34:27.440 --> 1:34:29.640
Have you kidnapped someone?
What's the need...

1:34:29.720 --> 1:34:32.440
Shut up!

1:34:36.200 --> 1:34:37.600
What's the need?

1:34:38.040 --> 1:34:41.320
Every single day, you remind me
how much money we need.

1:34:41.920 --> 1:34:44.760
Oven, AC... 80,000
for a pickle business...

1:34:45.080 --> 1:34:47.840
"I haven't gone to Shimla
in 10 years."

1:34:47.960 --> 1:34:51.080
Want to go to Shimla?
I'll have a ticket in 10 minutes.

1:35:01.280 --> 1:35:05.840
I'm glad you found out
the truth about Joy Bagman.

1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:08.840
At least, I don't have to hide it
from you anymore.

1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:14.960
Lata, just imagine...

1:35:16.920 --> 1:35:18.920
an end to all our problems.

1:35:23.000 --> 1:35:24.520
God is watching.

1:35:26.800 --> 1:35:29.240
He's also seeing our situation.

1:35:29.680 --> 1:35:31.960
And this is not
some poor man's money.

1:35:32.040 --> 1:35:34.400
Rich people hide their money this way.

1:35:34.520 --> 1:35:35.760
It is black money.

1:35:36.160 --> 1:35:39.880
I don't want it.
I wasn't raised this way.

1:35:40.160 --> 1:35:43.480
As if I was raised by bandits.

1:35:43.720 --> 1:35:49.040
Lata, you've seen how hard I slog.
We still make peanuts.

1:35:49.720 --> 1:35:52.960
Politicians, businessmen...
this is how they become rich.

1:35:53.160 --> 1:35:54.880
You know this.

1:35:55.480 --> 1:35:57.160
That's their destiny.

1:35:57.480 --> 1:35:59.360
Then this is ours.

1:35:59.840 --> 1:36:00.920
Fine.

1:36:01.920 --> 1:36:04.480
If my nagging led to all this,

1:36:05.160 --> 1:36:07.040
then accept my apologies!

1:36:07.160 --> 1:36:08.760
Please return it.

1:36:12.360 --> 1:36:13.880
I knew you'd react this way.

1:36:13.960 --> 1:36:16.240
That's why I didn't tell you.

1:36:16.600 --> 1:36:18.040
Return it?
To whom? Where?

1:36:18.120 --> 1:36:20.360
I don't know whose it is.
I found it on the street.

1:36:20.480 --> 1:36:22.200
And before taking it,
I even asked...

1:36:22.320 --> 1:36:24.840
"For the last time...
whose bag is it?"

1:36:24.960 --> 1:36:28.360
No one answered.
Who do I return it to?

1:36:28.880 --> 1:36:30.320
The police.

1:36:31.720 --> 1:36:32.720
Police?

1:36:34.000 --> 1:36:35.080
God!

1:36:35.960 --> 1:36:39.840
Do you really think,
I should lug this bag full of cash

1:36:40.000 --> 1:36:42.000
and go to the police?

1:36:42.280 --> 1:36:45.640
Yes and no.

1:36:54.840 --> 1:36:55.920
Who are you?

1:36:56.760 --> 1:37:00.960
Me? I am a cop... and not one.

1:37:04.480 --> 1:37:05.880
Namaste, madam.

1:37:06.440 --> 1:37:08.200
Won't you offer me a cup of tea?

1:37:13.960 --> 1:37:15.680
Nandan Kumar!

1:37:16.680 --> 1:37:18.840
You've got yourself in a real pickle.

1:37:21.920 --> 1:37:25.240
You took the suitcase
from Pipe Road on the 14th, right?

1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:31.200
Which suitcase? Who are you?

1:37:32.960 --> 1:37:34.120
Which suitcase?

1:37:36.800 --> 1:37:41.520
The one you were telling
your wife about.

1:37:42.080 --> 1:37:45.760
-Why didn't you report it to the cops?
-Sir, I'd try calling every day.

1:37:45.880 --> 1:37:47.600
The lines were busy so I thought...

1:37:48.360 --> 1:37:50.920
-Please don't hit him, sir.
-Quiet! Sit there.

1:37:51.000 --> 1:37:52.920
Sit. Just sit.

1:37:53.160 --> 1:37:56.000
-I'll sit...
-Sit... sit...

1:37:56.400 --> 1:37:59.280
Tell me, where's the suitcase?
Which gang do you belong to?

1:37:59.520 --> 1:38:02.240
Gang? I don't belong to any gang.
I swear.

1:38:02.360 --> 1:38:03.840
Fine, let's try the hard way.

1:38:03.920 --> 1:38:05.480
Don't, sir... I'll bring it.

1:38:05.640 --> 1:38:07.360
The suitcase is inside. I'll get it.

1:38:08.360 --> 1:38:10.240
Sir, she's getting it.

1:38:19.640 --> 1:38:20.840
Sir, here.

1:38:23.560 --> 1:38:24.680
Get back.

1:38:37.480 --> 1:38:39.760
Where's the rest of the money?

1:38:41.320 --> 1:38:44.080
-Blew it?
-Sir, just a second.

1:38:47.600 --> 1:38:50.480
Sir, 84,434 rupees.

1:38:51.160 --> 1:38:52.320
Please...

1:38:53.280 --> 1:38:54.680
Where's the rest?

1:38:55.400 --> 1:38:56.320
The rest?

1:38:57.320 --> 1:38:58.240
There's more?

1:38:59.600 --> 1:39:01.360
I'll give it to you.

1:39:01.600 --> 1:39:04.120
Please give me 10 minutes.
I'll get the rest. Please sit.

1:39:04.200 --> 1:39:06.000
Have some tea.
Lata, please give him some tea.

1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:08.640
We're out of sugar.

1:39:09.160 --> 1:39:11.520
Over? Fine.

1:39:12.120 --> 1:39:15.160
Don't move.

1:39:16.000 --> 1:39:17.160
Stay right there.

1:40:06.160 --> 1:40:07.040
Sir...

1:40:09.000 --> 1:40:11.520
Sir... sir!

1:40:14.720 --> 1:40:18.560
Sir, there's only this much at home.

1:40:22.400 --> 1:40:23.640
Meaning?

1:41:00.520 --> 1:41:03.200
Idiot, you think this is an Uber?
Sit upfront.

1:41:14.360 --> 1:41:15.880
Bala boss, did you see that?

1:41:15.960 --> 1:41:19.640
Yes. Follow him.

1:41:19.880 --> 1:41:21.360
I'm sending some more boys.

1:41:21.840 --> 1:41:24.760
No, boss. There's no time.
We'll steal the suitcase.

1:41:25.120 --> 1:41:25.880
What?

1:41:26.320 --> 1:41:30.120
At some point, hyena cubs must learn
to steal a meal from a lion's mouth.

1:41:30.720 --> 1:41:33.520
This they do in the deadly Savannah.

1:41:33.960 --> 1:41:35.560
Luckily for us, this is only Ghatkopar.

1:41:35.800 --> 1:41:37.520
Rajan, what did you just say?

1:41:37.720 --> 1:41:39.840
Last night, we saw the first episode...

1:41:40.000 --> 1:41:41.880
on 'The Amazing African Hyena'.

1:41:43.200 --> 1:41:46.000
We've subscribed
to National Geographic, boss.

1:41:50.040 --> 1:41:54.120
Rajan, Graduate...
you boys have grown up!

1:41:56.480 --> 1:42:01.200
Go forth, my boys...
bring the suitcase home.

1:42:03.040 --> 1:42:06.760
Sir, please stop here.
This is the back entrance to the office.

1:42:07.040 --> 1:42:08.600
I'll get the money.

1:42:08.720 --> 1:42:09.920
And listen, fool!

1:42:10.440 --> 1:42:14.560
No monkey business.
I know where you live.

1:42:15.200 --> 1:42:17.400
I know, sir. I'll be right back.

1:42:17.960 --> 1:42:22.000
Are you buying groceries?

1:42:22.960 --> 1:42:24.440
Take this bag.

1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:29.920
And leave this here.

1:42:40.120 --> 1:42:41.440
Nandan?

1:42:41.960 --> 1:42:44.560
What are you doing here?
Are you on the night shift?

1:42:44.800 --> 1:42:46.040
No, sir...

1:42:48.120 --> 1:42:51.000
I damaged the dampener.

1:42:51.400 --> 1:42:53.400
So I came to check on it.

1:42:59.640 --> 1:43:02.000
Come. Sit.

1:43:05.080 --> 1:43:08.080
-Come, drink with me today.
-No, sir... not today.

1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:13.320
Even you won't drink with me?
Not even one drink?

1:43:13.440 --> 1:43:16.200
Sir, it's just that...
I'm in a hurry to get home.

1:43:16.320 --> 1:43:19.000
I'm asking nicely.

1:43:19.840 --> 1:43:22.360
-Sir, I can't today.
-Sit...

1:43:22.560 --> 1:43:25.040
-Sir, it's late
-Sit!

1:43:25.560 --> 1:43:27.000
Sit.

1:43:27.160 --> 1:43:29.200
It's a request.

1:43:30.040 --> 1:43:31.600
Here...

1:43:38.040 --> 1:43:43.680
Nandan, my father, Kirodimal...

1:43:54.040 --> 1:43:57.520
I started the employee of the year award
in his memory.

1:43:57.960 --> 1:44:01.640
Do you know why?
I respected him a lot...

1:44:01.920 --> 1:44:03.560
I still do.

1:44:05.320 --> 1:44:09.200
But he never understood my feelings.

1:44:48.840 --> 1:44:49.920
Graduate?

1:44:50.360 --> 1:44:52.760
Yes boss, he even took a photograph.

1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:57.040
Didn't I tell you...
I was sending more men there.

1:44:57.520 --> 1:45:00.520
If Kolte tells Patil
that we're involved...

1:45:01.120 --> 1:45:03.040
do you know what will happen to us?

1:45:09.520 --> 1:45:11.280
Rajan, we won't spare Kolte.

1:45:12.120 --> 1:45:13.360
Yes, boss.

1:45:20.040 --> 1:45:23.560
When I was a young boy,
we were flying kites

1:45:24.720 --> 1:45:30.640
and I wrote my father's name,
on the kite... "Ki-ro-di-mal"

1:45:32.680 --> 1:45:33.560
Why?

1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:39.400
I wanted my father's name
to soar the skies.

1:45:41.920 --> 1:45:43.280
Up there!

1:45:45.680 --> 1:45:54.520
Everyone shouted...
"Look, Kirodimal rules the skies!"

1:45:57.000 --> 1:45:58.920
That, father didn't see.

1:46:01.520 --> 1:46:04.440
Later, someone cut my string

1:46:05.800 --> 1:46:12.120
and the kite tailspinned down
straight into the gutter.

1:46:12.720 --> 1:46:14.560
Everyone shouted,

1:46:14.680 --> 1:46:18.040
"Kirodimal is down in the gutter!"

1:46:18.880 --> 1:46:21.600
That, father saw.

1:46:26.560 --> 1:46:28.000
He blew his top.

1:46:29.200 --> 1:46:31.360
Was it my fault?

1:46:32.640 --> 1:46:34.400
Did I do it on purpose?

1:46:34.480 --> 1:46:36.040
I wanted his name...

1:46:36.720 --> 1:46:37.840
to soar...

1:46:46.760 --> 1:46:47.520
Hello.

1:46:47.640 --> 1:46:50.720
Playing games with the police?
You sent men after me?

1:46:50.840 --> 1:46:54.240
What are you talking about?
I'm stuck in the Press.

1:46:54.480 --> 1:46:56.720
Are you bringing the money
or printing it?

1:46:57.080 --> 1:46:58.400
What can I say, sir?

1:46:58.560 --> 1:47:00.680
My drunk boss has passed out
on my shoulder.

1:47:00.760 --> 1:47:01.920
He's crying about his father...

1:47:01.960 --> 1:47:04.480
Listen, change of plans.

1:47:04.880 --> 1:47:07.960
But, don't leave
unless I tell you. Got it?

1:47:08.840 --> 1:47:09.760
Yes, sir.

1:47:16.560 --> 1:47:22.280
Nandan, don't blame yourself
for the dampener.

1:48:04.000 --> 1:48:05.400
Yes, Patil sahab.

1:48:05.600 --> 1:48:08.400
Kolte, when am I hearing
the good news?

1:48:09.520 --> 1:48:11.680
I've got a solid lead.

1:48:11.840 --> 1:48:14.240
A few days, and the suitcase will be
in our hands.

1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:15.520
Whose hands?

1:48:15.720 --> 1:48:17.360
Obviously yours, sir.
Why?

1:48:17.960 --> 1:48:19.200
Just checking.

1:48:19.480 --> 1:48:22.080
I thought, by now
you would have the suitcase.

1:48:22.480 --> 1:48:24.720
If I did, wouldn't it be with you already?

1:48:25.440 --> 1:48:29.040
True that.
Fine, goodnight.

1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:38.280
Kolte says he hasn't
found the suitcase.

1:48:39.640 --> 1:48:45.800
I think Kolte was never planning on
telling me about the suitcase.

1:48:46.360 --> 1:48:48.280
And I foolishly did.

1:48:48.560 --> 1:48:49.640
What?

1:48:52.840 --> 1:48:58.840
Sir, as I was saying before,
my fight was with Omar.

1:49:00.680 --> 1:49:03.480
The moment I got to know
that the suitcase was yours,

1:49:03.600 --> 1:49:05.880
I came to apologise.

1:49:09.680 --> 1:49:12.560
Okay, sir... I'll take your leave.

1:49:14.440 --> 1:49:16.600
But Kolte didn't do the right thing.

1:49:17.120 --> 1:49:18.840
Nor did you.

1:49:20.440 --> 1:49:22.800
Kolte has the suitcase because of you.

1:49:22.880 --> 1:49:24.520
So, who should bring it back?

1:49:25.680 --> 1:49:26.880
Me?

1:49:27.040 --> 1:49:28.680
Good suggestion.

1:49:28.880 --> 1:49:30.200
Perfect.

1:49:30.760 --> 1:49:32.440
Get me the suitcase

1:49:32.560 --> 1:49:35.280
and that Shantaram Mill murder case...

1:49:36.720 --> 1:49:38.280
I won't let them re-open it.

1:49:43.960 --> 1:49:46.200
What happened?

1:49:46.720 --> 1:49:50.800
I hope you don't feel that
I'm manipulating you.

1:49:51.080 --> 1:49:52.720
Please don't!

1:49:52.840 --> 1:49:56.760
This is the start
of a long friendship.

1:49:59.560 --> 1:50:01.800
Look, your new friend is here, too.

1:50:03.680 --> 1:50:06.360
-Sir, what's he doing here?
-I could ask you the same.

1:50:06.480 --> 1:50:09.080
-Let's settle this right now!
-Why not?

1:50:09.160 --> 1:50:12.840
It's time for both of you
to join forces.

1:50:13.000 --> 1:50:14.280
Shake on it!

1:50:16.120 --> 1:50:21.480
When will you guys grow up?

1:50:23.040 --> 1:50:23.960
Fine.

1:50:24.760 --> 1:50:30.480
If you're done with your soap opera,
listen to me carefully.

1:50:31.040 --> 1:50:34.240
Do whatever it takes.

1:50:35.120 --> 1:50:37.800
Kill Kolte, if you have to.

1:50:38.320 --> 1:50:42.200
But, get me that suitcase.

1:50:42.680 --> 1:50:46.440
Nail this matter,
and consider all your cases shut.

1:50:49.120 --> 1:50:50.640
Now, get out.

1:50:58.360 --> 1:50:59.000
Yes, boss?

1:50:59.080 --> 1:51:01.080
Rajan, listen carefully.

1:51:01.160 --> 1:51:03.200
-Yes, boss?
-You have to do something urgently.

1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:09.480
-Listen...
-Yes, sir.

1:51:09.680 --> 1:51:11.600
First, get hold of the suitcase,

1:51:11.720 --> 1:51:13.960
and more importantly, the file!

1:51:14.640 --> 1:51:17.080
Okay, Patil sahab.
No mistakes this time.

1:51:23.680 --> 1:51:25.440
Sir, may I ask you a question?

1:51:26.320 --> 1:51:28.760
Do you think the file
is still in the suitcase?

1:51:28.840 --> 1:51:30.920
Do I think?
I know, it is.

1:51:31.640 --> 1:51:34.320
I realised when Kolte flipped.

1:51:35.280 --> 1:51:37.560
Both the suitcase and file
are with him.

1:51:38.640 --> 1:51:41.000
Anyway, we have to take
a chance, Subhash.

1:51:42.280 --> 1:51:46.200
And if you had asked questions
before giving the file to Omar,

1:51:46.320 --> 1:51:48.040
we wouldn't be in this soup.

1:51:48.160 --> 1:51:49.640
Go. Get me some tea.

1:51:56.040 --> 1:51:57.840
Patil, you slime-bag!

1:51:59.680 --> 1:52:02.000
I'll pull your strings now.

1:52:04.200 --> 1:52:06.920
Let's see who goes to Boomarbawdi now.

1:52:07.840 --> 1:52:11.960
You're my life, my love
O, I love you daddy!

1:52:13.080 --> 1:52:14.920
-Hello.
-Nandan, are you okay?

1:52:15.120 --> 1:52:17.760
Did you return the money?
Did the cop go?

1:52:17.880 --> 1:52:19.520
Come home, Nandan.
I'm really scared.

1:52:19.640 --> 1:52:20.640
Shut up!

1:52:20.840 --> 1:52:23.360
You shut up!
Please listen to me, Nandan...

1:52:23.560 --> 1:52:25.600
That wasn't for you, sir!

1:52:25.680 --> 1:52:28.160
He's your father.
Keep singing.

1:52:30.080 --> 1:52:31.920
-Lata, I'm fine.
-Why are you shouting at me?

1:52:32.040 --> 1:52:33.280
Don't ask me the details.

1:52:33.400 --> 1:52:35.440
I'll call later. Hang up now.

1:52:36.160 --> 1:52:40.960
You're my life, my love

1:52:41.560 --> 1:52:44.760
O, I love you Daddy!

1:52:48.480 --> 1:52:49.320
Faizu...

1:52:49.560 --> 1:52:51.160
Kolte sir, where are you?

1:52:51.240 --> 1:52:52.440
-Home.
-At home?

1:52:53.080 --> 1:52:54.280
I have some information.

1:52:54.520 --> 1:52:56.840
The Crime Branch is going to raid
your home.

1:52:56.920 --> 1:52:59.720
Raid? Go on.

1:53:00.600 --> 1:53:03.480
Confirmed news, sir.
They're targeting cops.

1:53:04.080 --> 1:53:05.680
The raid could take place tonight.

1:53:05.880 --> 1:53:10.760
Gopal, the CBI informer
got drunk and spilled it.

1:53:10.960 --> 1:53:13.040
Thought you should know.

1:53:13.280 --> 1:53:14.960
Fine. I'll figure something out.

1:53:15.200 --> 1:53:19.600
Listen, there's been an incident.
I need some information.

1:53:20.400 --> 1:53:23.280
I'm sending you a photograph.
Find out who it is.

1:53:23.560 --> 1:53:24.840
Okay, sir.

1:53:30.400 --> 1:53:33.040
There will be a photo
of Kolte like this too.

1:53:33.520 --> 1:53:35.320
And we'll use it for his funeral!

1:53:43.040 --> 1:53:46.240
Now the Serpentes
will come out of its hole.

1:53:53.240 --> 1:53:57.080
-I'm outside. Are you here?
-Listen, fool...

1:53:57.600 --> 1:53:59.200
I'm sending you an address.

1:53:59.960 --> 1:54:02.320
Meet me there quickly
with the money. Got it?

1:54:02.920 --> 1:54:04.440
How's that possible, sir?

1:54:05.000 --> 1:54:08.000
How do you expect me to travel
with so much money?

1:54:09.120 --> 1:54:14.280
Just like that night, when you got home
with even more money.

1:54:14.520 --> 1:54:15.680
Got it?

1:54:16.800 --> 1:54:17.680
Fine.

1:54:22.400 --> 1:54:23.440
Rickshaw!

1:54:50.240 --> 1:54:53.480
Let's take Kolte out at the next signal.
Don't waste any time.

1:54:56.080 --> 1:54:58.640
Hello, brother.
Yes, I've just reached Mumbai.

1:54:58.760 --> 1:55:00.840
Yes, just a bag full of clothes.

1:55:00.920 --> 1:55:02.320
Of course, there's no money...

1:55:02.440 --> 1:55:04.640
I'm going to sister Binu's.

1:55:28.200 --> 1:55:30.360
Bala, what should we do?

1:55:31.120 --> 1:55:32.200
Let's wait.

1:55:32.440 --> 1:55:34.520
-I'll see you later.
-Right, sir.

1:55:42.040 --> 1:55:44.600
Do I need to ask you
where Kolte's gone?

1:55:53.840 --> 1:55:55.320
Have you entered the gate?

1:55:55.960 --> 1:55:56.720
Yes, sir.

1:55:56.920 --> 1:56:01.240
See the black door
with police tape across it?

1:56:01.640 --> 1:56:04.400
Enter without tampering it.

1:56:20.560 --> 1:56:21.920
Sir, where are you?

1:56:22.240 --> 1:56:23.520
Keep walking.

1:57:06.760 --> 1:57:09.000
Fine. Get out.

1:57:10.000 --> 1:57:14.240
Sir, can I have my bag?

1:57:14.600 --> 1:57:15.800
Which bag?

1:57:15.960 --> 1:57:19.680
The cloth bag.
Lata will whine about it.

1:57:19.800 --> 1:57:22.400
I gave you your bag.
Please return mine.

1:57:22.520 --> 1:57:24.760
-The grocery bag?
-Yes.

1:57:26.200 --> 1:57:28.400
It must be by the door.
Take it and leave.

1:57:28.520 --> 1:57:29.400
Okay.

1:57:36.680 --> 1:57:37.960
What are you doing, sir?

1:57:59.760 --> 1:58:01.680
What are you dogs doing together?

1:58:02.000 --> 1:58:03.880
What are you doing
with the suitcase, rascal?

1:58:04.400 --> 1:58:06.600
What suitcase?

1:58:06.880 --> 1:58:10.960
There is no use lying.
We have a photo.

1:58:12.320 --> 1:58:15.520
Even if I do have the suitcase
do you think I'd bring it here?

1:58:15.720 --> 1:58:17.200
You take me for a fool?

1:58:17.920 --> 1:58:20.400
And I know it's not
just the suitcase you want.

1:58:21.040 --> 1:58:23.400
Patil is using us all.

1:58:23.760 --> 1:58:26.200
If you kill me,
you won't get anything.

1:58:26.560 --> 1:58:28.720
I have a much better plan.

1:58:29.640 --> 1:58:33.080
One that will benefit us all.
What do you say?

1:58:37.680 --> 1:58:41.880
Okay. Let's put our guns aside and talk.

1:59:03.240 --> 1:59:05.240
You're right, Kolte.

1:59:05.680 --> 1:59:08.880
We'll all benefit if we help each other.

1:59:11.040 --> 1:59:13.840
Like the plover bird and crocodile.

1:59:14.640 --> 1:59:15.720
Who?

1:59:15.960 --> 1:59:17.360
Plover bird...

1:59:18.160 --> 1:59:20.520
the one that cleans
the crocodile's teeth.

1:59:22.760 --> 1:59:24.120
Thank you, Rajan.

1:59:25.000 --> 1:59:27.640
In the jungle all animals help each other.

1:59:28.160 --> 1:59:31.800
The plover bird gets its food
and the crocodile's teeth are...

1:59:32.840 --> 1:59:34.440
You do know what a crocodile is, right?

1:59:34.560 --> 1:59:36.280
Of course, so?

1:59:36.400 --> 1:59:38.400
So its teeth get cleaned.

1:59:39.280 --> 1:59:42.160
Why are we discussing
crocodile dental hygiene?

1:59:42.280 --> 1:59:45.400
Sir, may I?

1:59:50.320 --> 1:59:52.000
Sir, it's a metaphor.

1:59:52.120 --> 1:59:55.440
The plover bird pecks
at the crocodile's teeth.

1:59:55.600 --> 1:59:58.400
The croc gets clean teeth,
the plover bird gets food.

1:59:58.480 --> 2:00:01.240
Thus they exist
in a symbiotic relationship.

2:00:01.320 --> 2:00:04.560
Repeat the last line.

2:00:04.680 --> 2:00:07.160
Thus they exist
in a symbiotic relationship.

2:00:10.960 --> 2:00:14.000
Fantastic. Well said.

2:00:15.000 --> 2:00:16.320
Thank you.

2:00:16.640 --> 2:00:18.120
But, who the heck are you?

2:00:18.440 --> 2:00:19.760
Sir, I...

2:00:20.040 --> 2:00:22.920
-Is he your friend?
-Not at all!

2:00:23.120 --> 2:00:26.360
We're in this situation because of him.
He stole the bag.

2:00:26.800 --> 2:00:30.440
Bala, he's right.
They left from his house earlier.

2:00:30.640 --> 2:00:32.000
Just a minute!

2:00:32.680 --> 2:00:35.880
Sir, Kolte is hiding something
that only I know of.

2:00:35.960 --> 2:00:37.640
He's playing you guys.

2:00:37.760 --> 2:00:41.080
-Have you gone nuts? Ignore him.
-Just a minute.

2:00:45.840 --> 2:00:46.720
Talk.

2:00:48.760 --> 2:00:50.280
I'll tell you, sir.

2:00:51.640 --> 2:00:55.160
I'm just a common man
and what good am I here?

2:00:55.240 --> 2:00:58.240
My work and identity are both common.

2:00:58.320 --> 2:01:00.640
My name's not common,
it's Nandan.

2:01:00.920 --> 2:01:03.520
But what kind of name is that?
It's so ordinary.

2:01:03.880 --> 2:01:06.720
And if your name is ordinary,
your career is ordinary too.

2:01:07.320 --> 2:01:10.440
And if your name and career are ordinary
then you are worthless.

2:01:10.600 --> 2:01:13.280
And worthless people are easily
taken advantage of.

2:01:13.400 --> 2:01:16.480
And then they say, "Use and discard."

2:01:24.080 --> 2:01:26.120
But what does Kolte
have to do with this?

2:01:28.160 --> 2:01:29.640
I haven't thought that through.

2:01:31.720 --> 2:01:33.120
Rajan, go get him.

2:01:38.080 --> 2:01:41.560
Kolte sir, I'm here!

2:01:55.800 --> 2:01:58.000
Who's man are you?
Omar or Bala's?

2:01:58.080 --> 2:01:59.960
I'm Lata's man!

2:02:18.280 --> 2:02:19.760
Abdul!

2:03:14.040 --> 2:03:15.280
Give me the magazine.

2:03:17.920 --> 2:03:19.720
The magazine.

2:04:33.640 --> 2:04:36.520
Nandan, where are you?
Are you alright?

2:04:37.200 --> 2:04:39.920
I'm fine, Lata. How's Aayush?

2:04:41.480 --> 2:04:43.600
Come back home quickly.

2:04:44.280 --> 2:04:45.840
I'm coming, Lata.

2:04:47.560 --> 2:04:49.600
I just want to sleep in peace.

2:04:51.760 --> 2:04:53.840
I'm tired of running after this money.

2:04:55.760 --> 2:04:57.160
It's pointless.

2:04:58.480 --> 2:05:01.480
I've seen it reduced to ashes
in front of my eyes.

2:05:03.680 --> 2:05:05.240
You were right, Lata.

2:05:06.280 --> 2:05:07.440
It's a curse.

2:05:10.440 --> 2:05:12.640
We'll go back to our old lives, Lata.

2:05:13.600 --> 2:05:16.280
Aayush, you and I.
We'll go to the beach.

2:05:16.520 --> 2:05:19.320
Eat Chinese. Simple things.

2:05:24.000 --> 2:05:26.360
Money became my obsession.

2:05:27.840 --> 2:05:31.680
But, if there's no life,
what good is an obsession?

2:05:38.880 --> 2:05:40.520
Nandan, are you there?

2:05:40.960 --> 2:05:42.280
Nandan?

2:05:42.560 --> 2:05:43.920
I'll call later.

2:05:44.400 --> 2:05:45.600
Later?

2:05:54.760 --> 2:06:00.000
For the last time... whose bag
and mango boxes are these?

2:06:04.600 --> 2:06:05.960
It's a very safe place, sir.

2:06:06.240 --> 2:06:08.360
It's our village.
Don't worry.

2:06:12.320 --> 2:06:14.240
Hello.

2:06:22.200 --> 2:06:25.600
Sir, you are Patil sahab, right?

2:06:28.520 --> 2:06:32.240
See I told you... he's Patil sahab.
