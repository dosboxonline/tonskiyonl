02:12.930 --> 02:18.635
<i>I am the lord of darkness.</i>

02:19.035 --> 02:24.375
<i>I require the solace of the shadows...</i>

02:24.775 --> 02:28.534
<i>and the dark of the night.</i>

02:30.080 --> 02:34.913
<i>Sunshine is my destroyer.</i>

02:37.021 --> 02:40.954
<i>All this shall change.</i>

02:42.359 --> 02:47.323
<i>Tonight, the sun sets forever.</i>

02:49.132 --> 02:53.965
<i>There shall never be another dawn...</i>

02:55.537 --> 02:56.805
<i>Enter!</i>

03:08.692 --> 03:12.044
<i>Ah, Blix.</i>

03:12.455 --> 03:14.922
Come closer.

03:17.528 --> 03:20.122
<i>You summoned me, lordship?</i>

03:21.799 --> 03:25.436
Are you not the most loathsome of my goblins?

03:27.436 --> 03:29.239
Truly, master.

03:29.739 --> 03:33.956
And is your heart black and full of hate?

03:34.177 --> 03:37.381
Black as midnight, black as pitch,

03:37.381 --> 03:39.683
blacker than the foulest witch.

03:39.683 --> 03:42.452
That is why I have called you here.

03:42.452 --> 03:46.957
Since I must remain in darkness,
you shall be my eyes and ears.

03:46.957 --> 03:49.358
You do me great honor, lord.

03:52.429 --> 03:54.999
<i>Something troubles me.</i>

03:55.858 --> 03:58.500
<i>I feel a presence in the forest,</i>

03:59.836 --> 04:03.373
<i>a force I had mercifully almost forgotten.</i>

04:03.373 --> 04:06.810
Must be dread, indeed,
to trouble you, lordship.

04:06.810 --> 04:09.813
Looking upon these frail creatures,

04:10.113 --> 04:13.383
one would not think that
they could contain such power.

04:13.551 --> 04:16.853
One could rule the universe with it.

04:17.694 --> 04:22.426
You must find them for me and destroy them!

04:24.726 --> 04:27.297
What do they look like, lord?

04:27.597 --> 04:32.135
Fool! Let this serve to remind you.

04:32.135 --> 04:35.272
They are each crowned with a single horn...

04:35.272 --> 04:37.542
reaching straight to heaven.

04:37.974 --> 04:40.105
I get the point, lord.

04:40.577 --> 04:43.347
Bring the horns to me.

04:43.647 --> 04:45.649
<i>You will be well rewarded.</i>

04:45.649 --> 04:49.419
<i>You shall be a prince here in my realm.</i>

04:49.419 --> 04:52.252
A rare privilege, master.

04:55.825 --> 04:57.828
Where shall I look, sire?

04:57.828 --> 05:02.144
There is only one lure for
such disgusting goodness,

05:02.265 --> 05:09.373
- one bait that never fails.
- What be this bait? Please, you teach me.

05:09.373 --> 05:13.400
Innocence. Innocence.

05:42.639 --> 05:48.512
<i>♪ Come, white flowers
Weave us a carpet ♪</i>

05:48.512 --> 05:53.951
<i>♪ Spreading oak
Make a shade where we lie ♪</i>

05:53.951 --> 05:59.189
<i>♪ Leaves and branches

05:59.189 --> 06:04.528
<i>♪ When I look in my true love's eyes ♪</i>

06:59.850 --> 07:01.943
Blooming fairies!

08:11.220 --> 08:12.623
<i>Lily!</i>

08:13.323 --> 08:15.859
<i>God bless, Your Highness.</i>

08:16.159 --> 08:18.762
A royal visit's always a pleasure.

08:18.962 --> 08:20.692
Have another biscuit.

08:29.705 --> 08:30.473
Nell...

08:33.043 --> 08:35.379
I have no time to stay for a visit today.

08:35.379 --> 08:37.447
Oh, you've got a sweetheart waiting?

08:37.447 --> 08:42.152
- No, I don't.
- Surely, your father forbids such folly.

08:42.692 --> 08:45.155
What my father doesn't
know won't trouble him.

08:45.155 --> 08:51.194
Oh, the willful heart invites despair,
like blind men creeping in a dragon's lair.

08:51.194 --> 08:55.065
<i>Not a country proverb nor king's command,
could keep me from the woods today.</i>

08:55.065 --> 09:01.471
Then it's common sense sort.
Lily. Princess Lily.

09:01.471 --> 09:06.309
I look on you as a daughter.
If you'll pardon my saying it,

09:06.459 --> 09:10.046
it's time you started behaving
like the princess you are.

09:10.046 --> 09:13.817
<i>You should be out looking for a
handsome prince on a white charger,</i>

09:13.817 --> 09:16.586
not visiting poor folk like us.

09:16.775 --> 09:21.717
No. Don't you know I love coming here?

09:26.596 --> 09:31.996
This place holds more magic for
me than any palace in the world.

09:32.235 --> 09:35.127
You live a very rich life, Nell.

09:35.439 --> 09:38.298
I don't know of a prince who
could carve wood like this.

09:38.941 --> 09:40.937
You're very sweet, Lily.

09:43.913 --> 09:46.117
Magic is a wonderful thing.

09:47.024 --> 09:49.820
<i>You'll find your own magic one day.</i>

09:49.820 --> 09:51.457
<i>I'm sure you will.</i>

09:53.857 --> 09:56.722
I have no time for this. I'm going.

10:00.997 --> 10:03.834
Oh, and you look out for
spriggen and banshee, my girl.

10:03.834 --> 10:05.969
<i>These woods be thick with them.</i>

10:05.969 --> 10:10.040
Stay clear of toadstool rings and willow trees...

10:10.040 --> 10:12.375
<i>and old oaks.</i>

10:12.375 --> 10:14.309
<i>Jack!</i>

10:16.513 --> 10:18.208
<i>Where are you?</i>

10:22.118 --> 10:24.052
Jack!

10:33.796 --> 10:36.288
<i>Jack. Jack!</i>

10:44.841 --> 10:46.832
Jack?

10:56.319 --> 10:58.253
Jack?

10:59.890 --> 11:02.017
Jack, answer me.

11:15.672 --> 11:18.539
Jack! Jack!

11:18.608 --> 11:20.542
<i>Jack.</i>

11:20.610 --> 11:25.695
Jack, please. Please, if you're here,
say something to me, please.

11:31.021 --> 11:33.457
Jack, you scared the life out of me!

11:46.303 --> 11:47.930
You're so clever.

11:50.339 --> 11:52.075
Oh, here.

11:52.075 --> 11:55.840
<i>Whoops. Look inside.
See what you can find.</i>

12:00.816 --> 12:02.641
That's something to eat.

12:05.854 --> 12:07.679
I made that for you myself.

12:12.295 --> 12:16.759
Well, I... I took it from Nell.

12:18.533 --> 12:21.397
Do you like it? Is it sweet?

12:26.659 --> 12:28.722
I know someone sweeter.

12:29.045 --> 12:36.081
<i>May be innocent, may be sweet...
ain't half as nice as rotting meat.</i>

12:52.202 --> 12:56.639
Good. Very good. Just right.

12:57.974 --> 13:01.645
Jack, now teach me rabbit like you promised.

13:01.645 --> 13:03.579
Rabbit?

13:05.482 --> 13:08.385
- It's much harder than finch.
- Let me try.

13:08.385 --> 13:12.617
I'm a good student, and my
father says I'm brilliant.

13:15.197 --> 13:17.360
See how brilliant I am?

13:17.738 --> 13:20.230
Let me dazzle you with my wisdom.

13:20.230 --> 13:23.670
It's much more than wisdom
that dazzles me, Lily.

13:26.670 --> 13:29.172
Jack, teach me rabbit.

13:29.823 --> 13:30.800
Not today.

13:31.240 --> 13:32.431
Why not?

13:32.842 --> 13:34.606
Because...

13:38.348 --> 13:42.216
there's something really special that
I've been promising to show you.

13:43.920 --> 13:47.057
- Jack, do you mean it?
- Only if it pleases you, Lily.

13:47.057 --> 13:48.712
Oh, it pleases me more than anything.

13:50.293 --> 13:51.996
We must go now...

13:53.396 --> 13:55.824
because they'll only be here for a short while.

14:00.470 --> 14:02.553
Don't you trust me?

14:05.642 --> 14:08.167
I trust you, Lily.

15:43.540 --> 15:45.407
Oh, Jack.

17:14.163 --> 17:18.290
<i>Look! Ugly one-horned mules.</i>

17:28.411 --> 17:30.382
Nothing is more magical.

17:32.582 --> 17:34.752
<i>As long as they roam the earth,</i>

17:35.221 --> 17:38.519
evil can never harm the pure of heart.

17:54.136 --> 17:55.804
Do you speak their language?

17:57.407 --> 18:00.358
<i>They express only love and laughter.</i>

18:00.910 --> 18:03.544
Dark thoughts are unknown to them.

18:06.282 --> 18:09.547
No! No.

18:17.961 --> 18:20.156
Please.

18:44.487 --> 18:47.149
Lily, no, please!

Jack!

22:22.138 --> 22:28.110
<i>- It was lovely... like a dream.
- What you did is forbidden.</i>

22:28.410 --> 22:30.265
Who says so?

22:30.313 --> 22:34.116
<i>It is known, Lily. These are sacred animals.</i>

22:34.116 --> 22:38.348
<i>- I don't care.
- You risk your immortal soul talking like that.</i>

22:42.592 --> 22:48.052
I only wanted to touch one.
Where's the harm in that?

22:50.967 --> 22:52.491
It was magic.

22:55.137 --> 22:56.704
Thank you.

22:58.874 --> 23:00.404
Let me sing to you.

- I'm afraid you'll break my heart.

23:53.129 --> 23:54.831
Then still your heart.

23:55.331 --> 23:58.266
You're dear to me as life itself.

24:00.302 --> 24:04.386
- Don't you wish this was our wedding ring?
- If I say yes, will my wish come true?

24:04.606 --> 24:06.111
I'm a princess.

24:06.809 --> 24:09.845
It's my right to set a challenge for my suitors.

24:11.712 --> 24:13.549
I will marry...

24:13.549 --> 24:15.442
whoever finds this ring.

24:21.290 --> 24:22.284
Jack!

26:46.435 --> 26:50.667
Lily!

28:06.214 --> 28:09.350
I smell human flesh!

28:13.221 --> 28:16.553
<i>- After you, Pig.
- Oh, no, after you.</i>

28:35.044 --> 28:41.083
<i>Clock. Mortal world turned to ice.
Here be goblin paradise!</i>

28:43.351 --> 28:46.021
<i>Plenty hospitality here.</i>

28:46.121 --> 28:48.091
Baby!

28:48.591 --> 28:54.325
<i>- I simply adore milk-fed meat.
- What are you, some kind of animal?</i>

29:00.168 --> 29:01.265
<i>Oh.</i>

29:05.939 --> 29:08.344
How did you do that, Blix?

29:08.344 --> 29:12.783
- Yeah, tell us how you do those tricks.
- Quite easy, actually.

29:16.283 --> 29:19.887
- Goblin omelette.
- Very nice, very nice.

29:21.856 --> 29:25.260
Lucky day!
Kill ugly one-horned dead!

29:25.260 --> 29:29.565
You act like you do all. It was me
who shoot the poisoned stinger.

29:29.565 --> 29:32.671
Me! Me! Me!

29:32.671 --> 29:35.571
You only got the shot in
because the princess was there.

29:35.571 --> 29:38.574
Wrong! It was beauty led the beast to bay.

29:38.574 --> 29:43.646
<i>She was so sweet.
I could eat her brains like jam.</i>

29:43.646 --> 29:47.016
- I could suck her bones...
- Enough!

29:47.016 --> 29:51.850
Better hurry. Dark Lord, he don't like to wait.

29:52.720 --> 29:54.947
Mmmm.

30:11.774 --> 30:16.414
- Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
- What have I done?

30:18.414 --> 30:22.243
<i>Four, five, six! Hurray for Blix!</i>

30:23.717 --> 30:25.678
I'll make it right.

30:56.351 --> 30:58.285
Jack.

31:06.395 --> 31:09.023
Lily? Lily?

31:12.234 --> 31:13.460
Jack?

31:19.972 --> 31:20.933
Who's there?

31:22.010 --> 31:23.279
<i>Who are you?</i>

31:24.079 --> 31:27.649
Here be forest child and not know the Gump?

31:29.849 --> 31:30.846
Gump, is it?

31:31.619 --> 31:34.677
Honeythorn Gump at your service.

31:48.736 --> 31:51.039
I... I must be dreaming.

31:51.839 --> 31:55.644
If life is a dream, better you dread the waking.

31:55.944 --> 31:59.448
- Jack?
- Stop it!

31:59.448 --> 32:02.239
<i>- That's Oona. She likes you.
- Go away!</i>

32:02.717 --> 32:05.077
Does your blood run so cold, Jack?

32:05.754 --> 32:08.724
You'll be a gobs before your time.

32:09.524 --> 32:10.886
How'd you know my name?

32:13.562 --> 32:17.099
How does a migrating swallow...

32:17.099 --> 32:20.269
know the way south in winter?

32:20.557 --> 32:22.571
Or a spawning salmon...

32:22.571 --> 32:25.274
find the very source of his birth...

32:25.274 --> 32:30.279
from the cold, black depth
of the mysterious sea?

32:30.779 --> 32:33.849
I know everything, Jack.

32:34.149 --> 32:35.613
Everything?

32:42.024 --> 32:46.392
Then why is it like this?
Why is there winter now?

32:48.697 --> 32:52.020
I'd be a powerful wizard,
indeed, could I answer.

32:52.201 --> 32:55.537
- Suppose you tell me, Jack.
- Me?

32:57.706 --> 33:01.107
You know these woods as well as any elf.

33:07.683 --> 33:10.386
Did you not see something odd today?

33:11.686 --> 33:14.089
Any strange spirits?

33:14.689 --> 33:17.023
Did nothing untoward happen?

33:19.727 --> 33:26.935
- No.
- No? No?... Nothing?

33:26.935 --> 33:32.543
- Uh, I did take Lily to see the Unicorns.
- You did what?

33:34.943 --> 33:36.378
Silence!

33:42.184 --> 33:44.219
Oh, God, Gump, she touched him.

33:44.680 --> 33:48.656
Touched it? A mortal laid hands on a Unicorn?

33:48.656 --> 33:52.024
<i>Jack! Squawk, squawk, no more talk!</i>

33:54.363 --> 33:59.522
Do you think you can upset the order
of the universe and not pay the price?

34:00.101 --> 34:02.493
But... but she meant no wrong!

34:06.742 --> 34:10.005
<i>What I did is done, but I did it for love.</i>

34:12.277 --> 34:13.645
Silence!

34:14.516 --> 34:19.101
Love, you say? But answer me this riddle,

34:19.353 --> 34:21.447
and all will be forgiven.

34:22.556 --> 34:24.993
<i>- And if I cannot?
- Why, Jack,</i>

34:25.679 --> 34:28.553
then 'tis your death song I'll be playing.

34:31.833 --> 34:33.697
Then ask away...

34:34.668 --> 34:37.395
<i>and pray God my answer pleases you.</i>

34:57.025 --> 34:59.761
What is a bell that does not ring...

34:59.761 --> 35:02.730
yet its knell makes the angels sing?

35:03.198 --> 35:05.470
<i>- I know the answer!
- Shhh!</i>

35:08.470 --> 35:10.724
Answer me this...

35:12.106 --> 35:14.226
<i>and all will be forgiven.</i>

35:31.426 --> 35:32.595
Flowers?

35:34.662 --> 35:39.995
- Bluebells! To hear them ring means
your life is at an end! - No!

35:51.580 --> 35:54.349
Damn it! Damn it! Damn it!

35:54.349 --> 35:56.918
<i>Riddles! Riddles! Riddles!</i>

35:56.918 --> 36:00.716
<i>Damn it! Riddles! Riddles! Riddles!</i>

36:05.360 --> 36:06.794
Gump?

36:09.731 --> 36:11.065
Gump?

36:17.806 --> 36:19.075
Gump?

36:23.744 --> 36:28.251
You've bested me, Jack.
Bested me, bested me.

36:29.551 --> 36:33.255
A riddle without an answer's like an
empty cup when you're thirsty for wine.

36:33.255 --> 36:37.526
Well spoken! And if it's wine you
want, it's wine we shall have.

36:37.526 --> 36:42.455
<i>Brown Tom! A small measure
of entertainment at best.</i>

36:44.132 --> 36:46.869
<i>But, Gump, it's the last
bottle of me best wine.</i>

36:46.869 --> 36:49.970
Oh-Oh, if you say so, sir.

36:52.307 --> 36:53.741
Mmm.

36:58.580 --> 37:01.372
<i>Now, Gump, don't you be forgetting me.</i>

37:02.684 --> 37:04.512
Oh, careful now.

37:05.120 --> 37:07.223
Oh, it's so precious.

37:08.623 --> 37:10.158
Elderberry wine.

37:11.126 --> 37:14.262
- I'm sorry.
- No finer drink under heaven.

37:14.350 --> 37:16.665
- Here's to Jack,
- Oh, brother.

37:16.665 --> 37:21.854
riddle solver, dancing fool and fairy friend.

37:21.903 --> 37:22.830
<i>Tip it.</i>

37:31.510 --> 37:33.148
Here, this'll help.

37:33.848 --> 37:35.484
Don't you care what's happened?

37:35.484 --> 37:39.321
Of course we care. What good's a
world locked in a season of death?

37:39.321 --> 37:41.923
<i>- But we must find the answer.
- That we must.</i>

37:42.112 --> 37:45.627
But first we must see that no
harm's come to the Unicorn.

37:45.627 --> 37:47.914
<i>I sadly fear the worst.</i>

38:33.474 --> 38:35.769
Wait. Shhh!

38:42.484 --> 38:45.009
Lily!

38:46.655 --> 38:49.046
Jack, what?

39:39.407 --> 39:40.841
Jack!

41:24.811 --> 41:26.278
Forgive me.

41:31.353 --> 41:33.287
I meant no wrong.

42:19.000 --> 42:23.437
Well, Jack, tell us what has happened.

42:32.747 --> 42:36.952
Come on, Jack. Don't keep us in the dark.

42:37.452 --> 42:39.989
The dark is where we'll stay.

42:41.589 --> 42:42.791
We're cursed.

42:42.791 --> 42:44.528
Is there naught we can do?

42:46.828 --> 42:49.053
We must get the alicorn back.

42:50.532 --> 42:53.384
Only then will the world return to normal.

42:54.969 --> 42:56.535
We must find a champion...

42:58.072 --> 43:01.376
bold of heart and pure in spirit.

43:01.376 --> 43:04.612
<i>Champion? What champion?</i>

43:04.912 --> 43:06.949
<i>Don't give up so quick, lads.</i>

43:08.751 --> 43:09.913
You'll do.

43:11.653 --> 43:13.833
We must get you some weapons.

43:14.322 --> 43:16.925
But, Gump, I know nothing of weapons.

43:16.925 --> 43:20.062
You'll learn. I know where to find the best.

43:20.757 --> 43:24.599
<i>Brown Tom, stay here with
the Unicorn and guard her well.</i>

43:24.599 --> 43:28.485
<i>- Like me own life.
- Better. She's the last of her kind.</i>

43:40.715 --> 43:44.418
Magic horn is mine, mine, mine.

43:44.698 --> 43:47.489
Now all creatures will love the night...

43:47.489 --> 43:50.491
and worship goblins as divine.

43:50.491 --> 43:53.227
You shouldn't talk like that, Blix.

43:53.227 --> 43:56.863
Why not? I've got the power now.

43:57.731 --> 43:59.528
Plenty big talk.

44:09.677 --> 44:13.104
Not even darkness lasts forever.

44:19.287 --> 44:22.345
Jack, I can't go with you now.

44:22.957 --> 44:25.523
Anyway, Oona will guide the way.

44:29.497 --> 44:33.661
Follow me, Jack. Over here. Come on.

44:41.327 --> 44:43.223
<i>Come on. Hurry! Hurry!</i>

44:55.823 --> 44:57.280
Come on, Jack.

45:14.823 --> 45:16.280
No, over here.

45:19.580 --> 45:23.478
Here, Jack... Come on.

45:50.780 --> 45:52.324
I'm Onna.

45:54.381 --> 45:55.747
Oona.

45:58.118 --> 46:02.077
Nobody knows but you. It's our secret, Jack.

46:02.189 --> 46:05.222
<i>Don't tell Gump. Promise?</i>

46:05.727 --> 46:07.429
<i>Promise!</i>

46:08.629 --> 46:14.402
<i>I could be anything you want me to be,
even your heart's desire.</i>

46:14.897 --> 46:17.072
<i>You've got to help us, Jack.</i>

46:17.972 --> 46:21.565
<i>The fairies' love makes anything possible.</i>

46:31.052 --> 46:35.423
Higher, higher, burning fire.

46:35.423 --> 46:38.291
<i>Making music like a choir.</i>

46:39.560 --> 46:45.533
- It seems a pity to waste such power.
- Waste? Better watch out, old pal Pox,

46:45.533 --> 46:48.436
or I'll turn you into little pork chops.

46:48.436 --> 46:51.406
Why not turn everything into garbage?

46:51.406 --> 46:54.308
A great towering mountain of slop.

46:54.308 --> 46:55.836
Wouldn't that be magic?

46:57.512 --> 47:00.882
Higher, higher, burning fire.

47:00.882 --> 47:05.046
<i>Making music like a choir.</i>

47:08.856 --> 47:12.226
Blix, Blix. Blix!

47:12.726 --> 47:15.354
- What?
- Big D!

47:18.765 --> 47:20.197
Stop!

47:20.968 --> 47:28.576
Hear me, you angel of darkness!
Your reign is over! A new order begins!

47:28.576 --> 47:32.034
- I hold the power!
- Enough!

47:34.882 --> 47:40.487
Shit! Please! It was... only a joke.

47:41.887 --> 47:43.324
I didn't mean it.

47:44.235 --> 47:46.327
No!... No!

47:46.327 --> 47:48.663
Have you no sense of humor?

47:48.963 --> 47:51.054
<i>Adios, amigos!</i>

47:55.135 --> 47:56.938
Wow.

47:57.241 --> 47:59.173
<i>Forgive that intrusion, great lord,</i>

47:59.173 --> 48:02.443
<i>- but... goblins are inclined to be outspoken,
- Yeah.</i>

48:02.443 --> 48:04.645
and I like to encourage their initiative.

48:04.645 --> 48:07.815
Did you think this a mere plaything?

48:08.420 --> 48:11.652
<i>With it, my empire is eternal.</i>

48:11.652 --> 48:14.322
<i>Before I ruled only the night.</i>

48:14.322 --> 48:20.630
Now my minions will frolic in
darkness until the end of time.

48:22.530 --> 48:26.000
The Unicorns are dead, is this not true?

48:26.000 --> 48:29.870
- True, lord, very plenty true.
- Undeniably true.

48:29.870 --> 48:33.212
You lie! Here is dawn!

48:33.307 --> 48:36.677
<i>It is essentially true. On the other hand...</i>

48:36.853 --> 48:41.114
- Stallion is dead. Dead as dreams.
- Out with it!

48:41.114 --> 48:42.850
The mare lives still!

48:42.850 --> 48:47.221
<i>If even one Unicorn walks the
earth, my power is not complete.</i>

48:47.221 --> 48:50.224
She's just a female, lord. She has no power.

48:50.224 --> 48:52.724
Only the power of creation.

48:53.860 --> 48:55.997
Get the mare!

48:56.997 --> 48:59.689
I command you!

49:03.636 --> 49:05.306
Well, let's see, what have we here?

49:05.306 --> 49:09.338
Ah, a little sassafras.

49:09.910 --> 49:12.122
<i>A little spearmint would be nice, huh?</i>

49:12.213 --> 49:13.973
Some fox glove?

49:14.849 --> 49:17.621
And a little colt's foot.

49:21.421 --> 49:24.215
Hey, who goes there, what?

49:28.128 --> 49:34.068
- I'm... I'm Princess Lily.
- You!... You're the cause of all our sorrow.

49:34.068 --> 49:37.538
I'm... I'm so sorry.

49:37.697 --> 49:43.044
I didn't know... Please, please forgive me.

49:43.044 --> 49:46.011
- I'm not the one you should be askin'.
- Listen to me.

49:47.147 --> 49:50.251
Try and understand.
I'm only trying to make things right.

49:50.946 --> 49:53.754
Darkness has sent the
goblins back for the mare.

49:53.754 --> 49:58.226
It's not safe to stay here. You'll
have to hurry! Leave now! Go!

49:58.226 --> 50:02.095
- Good lass. You're a plucky little partridge.
- Hurry!

50:02.263 --> 50:03.765
Too late!

50:03.765 --> 50:07.798
You imps are lookin' for a fight, you
come to the chap who'll oblige ya.

50:17.578 --> 50:19.305
Try this on for size.

50:19.480 --> 50:21.983
You can't beat me. Ha-ha, look at that!

50:23.177 --> 50:25.453
<i>Keep 'em coming, fellas! Ha-ha!</i>

50:25.453 --> 50:30.424
Oh, check this out! Yes, sir. You see?

50:30.735 --> 50:34.659
<i>You just can't beat me! You can't...</i>

50:35.062 --> 50:38.856
Little tool is stuck. They done for me.

50:51.879 --> 50:52.913
Quick!

50:57.084 --> 50:58.746
Wait for me!

51:04.025 --> 51:05.464
Brown Tom!

51:10.694 --> 51:14.502
Brown Tom, you can't be dead.

51:14.721 --> 51:17.338
<i>This is terrible. Terrible!</i>

51:18.022 --> 51:20.357
<i>- Brown Tom.
- Brown Tom.</i>

51:20.905 --> 51:22.132
Gump?

51:22.709 --> 51:23.936
Screwball.

51:25.012 --> 51:26.637
Jack, lad.

51:27.714 --> 51:31.619
- They killed you too?
- Of course they didn't.

51:31.919 --> 51:35.589
- But what in blazes are you talking about?
- Goblins.

51:35.589 --> 51:38.926
- Goblins?
- Shot me through me brain pan.

51:39.226 --> 51:40.092
Oh.

51:41.362 --> 51:43.924
That's one spot an arrow will do no harm.

51:44.098 --> 51:48.703
<i>I... I did my best to fight 'em off, but
they swarmed up by the hundreds.</i>

51:48.703 --> 51:53.503
<i>All fierce creatures they were.
The princess warned me, but...</i>

51:53.507 --> 51:55.676
- Lily?
- Aye.

51:55.976 --> 51:57.309
Then she's alive!

51:57.678 --> 52:00.181
She was alive still when they killed me.

52:00.681 --> 52:02.411
The goblins must have taken her.

52:02.503 --> 52:04.824
We follow their tracks in the snow.

52:10.424 --> 52:12.560
The Great Tree.

52:12.991 --> 52:16.063
<i>When evil anarchy ruled the land,</i>

52:16.063 --> 52:19.294
<i>the wicked came here to sacrifice.</i>

52:53.665 --> 52:56.270
Ugly. I hate it.

52:56.326 --> 53:01.075
- Good. You go first.
- Why always me?

53:01.875 --> 53:03.135
Go!

53:09.381 --> 53:10.633
Foreigner.

53:12.051 --> 53:14.245
Oh,... slippery.

53:21.662 --> 53:22.998
Uh, uh...

53:23.998 --> 53:26.812
Oh, okay, okay.

53:39.112 --> 53:39.947
<i>I made it!</i>

53:40.547 --> 53:41.482
Screwball!

53:55.129 --> 53:58.323
Foul-tasting fairy!

54:03.170 --> 54:06.888
Come to Meg, juicy boy.

54:11.745 --> 54:15.916
Who be this tender morsel...

54:16.345 --> 54:20.354
disturbing Meg Mucklebone's rest?

54:21.608 --> 54:23.888
Jack. They call me Jack, ma'am.

54:27.394 --> 54:31.765
What a fine, fat boy you are, Jack.

54:31.765 --> 54:33.755
You don't really mean to
eat me, do you, ma'am?

54:33.968 --> 54:35.973
Oh, indeed I do!

54:39.873 --> 54:42.452
But that would be a shame,
because someone as fair...

54:43.577 --> 54:48.143
and lovely as yourself, Miss Meg,
deserves far better than scrawny me.

54:50.017 --> 54:51.486
Don't you think?

54:52.251 --> 54:58.992
You... think... me fair,... do you, Jack?

54:59.287 --> 55:02.853
All the heavenly angels
must envy your beauty.

55:10.671 --> 55:13.374
What a fine meal you'll make,

55:13.374 --> 55:17.911
be the rest of you as sweet as your tongue.

55:18.008 --> 55:19.613
Wait! No!

55:19.613 --> 55:23.418
Please, your Loveliness, feast on
the beauty of your reflection.

55:24.217 --> 55:27.288
You are an angel, Miss Meg.

55:27.569 --> 55:30.443
<i>- Look. Look.
- Oh.</i>

55:30.443 --> 55:32.753
What a splendid idea.

55:39.365 --> 55:41.446
Clever boy!

55:44.068 --> 55:45.232
Yes.

55:45.306 --> 55:48.972
<i>Your alchemy makes
crusted steel shine like silver.</i>

55:50.844 --> 55:56.539
That's discerning taste,
for one so young, Jack.

56:02.489 --> 56:05.333
<i>Come. Come, Jack!</i>

56:06.226 --> 56:09.452
Give us a kiss... before dining!

56:25.846 --> 56:26.740
I did it!

57:48.961 --> 57:50.095
Screwball!

57:56.837 --> 57:59.707
Oh, okay. Okay.

58:00.212 --> 58:03.600
Oh! Whee! Look.

58:04.077 --> 58:06.043
What a big trumpet!

58:06.414 --> 58:10.544
- I'll bet it makes a lot of noise.
- Our lives are lost if it blows.

58:13.954 --> 58:15.888
Hmm.

58:17.925 --> 58:19.951
Mm-hmm.

58:25.599 --> 58:26.763
Mm-hmm.

58:29.837 --> 58:31.897
Oh!

58:35.142 --> 58:36.908
I think it stopped.

58:43.116 --> 58:44.380
Look out!

58:53.660 --> 58:55.586
<i>My back! Me achin'back!</i>

58:56.029 --> 58:59.397
Oh, I'm not as old as I used to be, you know.

59:02.236 --> 59:10.242
<i>- Oh. Hey, where are we?
- Someplace we don't want to be.</i>

59:13.846 --> 59:16.105
Hey, hey! Wait for me!

59:16.316 --> 59:19.901
We gotta get out of here!
It's the stench of hell itself!

59:22.656 --> 59:25.258
Shh! Quiet!

59:26.237 --> 59:30.130
You'll be fricasseed fairies
if you don't keep quiet.

59:30.130 --> 59:31.765
Who be you, bucket head?

59:31.765 --> 59:38.434
Who I am won't help me nor you, neither,
even know we are all brothers.

59:43.609 --> 59:44.678
What happened to you?

59:44.769 --> 59:46.680
It's a long story.

59:46.888 --> 59:53.820
<i>Let's just say I went looking for adventure,
and found more than I could handle.</i>

59:53.913 --> 59:56.123
<i>Doesn't matter now anyway.</i>

59:56.955 --> 59:59.988
We are all in the same fix!

01:00:01.328 --> 01:00:05.621
I knew it. I knew it.
I should have stayed at home.

01:00:06.432 --> 01:00:13.596
<i>Let's face it, brothers.
Me... and you all... is barbecue.</i>

01:00:16.576 --> 01:00:19.646
- Barbecue?
- That's right. Barbecue.

01:00:19.738 --> 01:00:22.147
Only dead meat waits for the stew pot.

01:00:24.284 --> 01:00:26.446
Spring the lock with your magic, Gump.

01:00:43.103 --> 01:00:46.606
- Iron is trouble for elves.
- Iron, huh?

01:00:49.877 --> 01:00:51.271
Oh!

01:01:03.023 --> 01:01:04.954
Oh, no!

01:01:07.527 --> 01:01:08.661
The thing!

01:01:12.499 --> 01:01:17.436
- Oh, no! He's coming! Hide!
- Hide! - Hide! Hide!

01:01:19.539 --> 01:01:20.337
Oh!

01:01:25.111 --> 01:01:27.570
I don't think I can handle it! Help me!

01:02:01.013 --> 01:02:03.383
Let me go! Let me go!

01:02:03.383 --> 01:02:07.581
Help! Help me!

01:02:09.256 --> 01:02:12.901
Please! Please! Help me!

01:02:13.493 --> 01:02:16.756
Oh, you beast! Help me!

01:02:25.571 --> 01:02:27.835
<i>Let me go!</i>

01:02:38.084 --> 01:02:40.820
Gump, we've got to help him.

01:02:40.820 --> 01:02:43.423
Oh, don't worry. Our brother
can take care of himself.

01:02:43.423 --> 01:02:45.602
I'm sure of it, I think.

01:02:46.359 --> 01:02:50.596
Screwball's right. It's more important
that you find the Unicorn.

01:02:50.596 --> 01:02:53.023
Why not have Oona fly out, find a key?

01:02:54.768 --> 01:02:57.904
<i>Oona? But she's much too small.</i>

01:02:58.012 --> 01:02:59.672
Could never lift it.

01:03:01.941 --> 01:03:03.176
<i>Our secret!</i>

01:03:03.176 --> 01:03:06.112
Our secret will keep forever in
this grave if you don't help us.

01:03:06.212 --> 01:03:07.672
You promised!

01:03:08.848 --> 01:03:13.019
You willful sprite. How dare
you keep such secrets?

01:03:13.019 --> 01:03:14.451
They're mine to keep.

01:03:20.627 --> 01:03:25.326
I'll do what you ask... if you'll kiss me, Jack.

01:03:35.408 --> 01:03:36.542
Easy enough.

01:03:43.883 --> 01:03:48.179
You call that a kiss? Am I not sweet?

01:03:51.291 --> 01:03:53.027
Sweeter than bee pollen...

01:03:54.133 --> 01:03:55.395
on a summer wind.

01:03:57.897 --> 01:04:01.355
Sweet as the wind that blows me to you.

01:04:05.036 --> 01:04:07.802
Oh, it's fairy magic.

01:04:09.108 --> 01:04:10.008
Lily?

01:04:11.977 --> 01:04:15.314
- Lily?
- Yes, Jack.

01:04:24.873 --> 01:04:26.332
This isn't real.

01:04:26.693 --> 01:04:28.557
Oh, it is.

01:04:29.229 --> 01:04:31.498
I'm warm and alive...

01:04:32.283 --> 01:04:34.432
and want to be in your arms.

01:04:58.124 --> 01:05:03.161
No, I... I can't. No.
This is just more fairy glamour.

01:05:06.165 --> 01:05:08.696
Human hearts don't work that way.

01:05:09.652 --> 01:05:14.658
What care I for human hearts?
Soft and spiritless as porridge!

01:05:15.342 --> 01:05:18.771
A fairy's heart beats fierce and free!

01:05:25.385 --> 01:05:26.253
<i>Oona!</i>

01:05:29.522 --> 01:05:33.327
Your fine sensibilities have left us here to rot!

01:05:33.327 --> 01:05:35.091
<i>I'm behind you all the way, Gump.</i>

01:05:40.934 --> 01:05:44.065
You look like mourners at your own funeral.

01:05:48.008 --> 01:05:48.977
Oona!

01:05:58.696 --> 01:05:59.583
<i>Quick, lads!</i>

01:06:05.658 --> 01:06:07.086
<i>You!</i>

01:06:08.661 --> 01:06:11.153
You mortal, you!

01:06:11.231 --> 01:06:15.384
I could vex you! Dance your life away!

01:06:31.484 --> 01:06:33.334
Uh, I'll stay here and...

01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:36.818
Ah! Wait for me!

01:06:52.906 --> 01:06:55.969
A... terrible sight for a sober man.

01:07:07.086 --> 01:07:11.755
Shh!... We must find the dungeons.

01:07:12.491 --> 01:07:14.895
I think I'll stay right here,
thank you very much.

01:07:14.895 --> 01:07:17.397
Not so fast! You'll search with the rest of us.

01:07:17.397 --> 01:07:20.199
- Then I'll go with Jack.
- No! We split up.

01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:24.438
- Yes! It's better if we go in teams.
- No, I will go with... - Shh!

01:07:25.853 --> 01:07:27.759
Gump and me, Brown Tom and Screwball.

01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:29.674
Right. Let's synchronize.

01:07:40.921 --> 01:07:45.926
We meet back here in twice
500 beats of a bluebird's heart.

01:07:45.926 --> 01:07:49.562
Do you know what I think? I think we should
add a couple more hundred breaths of a...

01:07:49.562 --> 01:07:50.453
Shh!

01:07:52.932 --> 01:07:54.637
Take care. Come on, Jack.

01:07:58.041 --> 01:07:59.171
Be careful.

01:08:05.377 --> 01:08:08.515
- There's only one thing I want to know.
- What?

01:08:09.010 --> 01:08:11.151
- Why me?
- Shh!

01:08:11.549 --> 01:08:14.788
- I think we should go west.
- I think we should go east.

01:08:14.788 --> 01:08:16.022
- Oh, okay.
- Wait!

01:08:18.992 --> 01:08:28.868
<i>Father, I hold the world in my grasp,
and yet this girl... distracts me.</i>

01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:33.573
<i>It has been an eternity
since I felt such desire.</i>

01:08:33.872 --> 01:08:36.109
<i>What am I to do?</i>

01:08:36.109 --> 01:08:42.115
<i>She fascinates you
because her soul is pure.</i>

01:08:42.115 --> 01:08:45.051
<i>- I'll take her then.
- Fool!</i>

01:08:45.444 --> 01:08:49.990
<i>You must woo her!</i>

01:08:50.689 --> 01:08:55.228
She remembers the world as it was,

01:08:55.562 --> 01:08:58.732
so... tempt her.

01:08:59.229 --> 01:09:01.468
Win her.

01:09:01.968 --> 01:09:06.495
<i>Make her one of us.</i>

01:09:20.252 --> 01:09:22.828
Hmm. Hey. Psst!

01:09:23.356 --> 01:09:24.791
Psst! Psst!

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:28.361
Did, did you see something?

01:09:28.361 --> 01:09:31.055
- No, did you?
- I don't know.

01:09:31.464 --> 01:09:33.298
I think.

01:11:19.171 --> 01:11:21.674
<i>D-D-D-Did you hear that?</i>

01:11:21.869 --> 01:11:23.025
What's that?

01:11:23.076 --> 01:11:25.310
That's a horse, you idiot.

01:11:32.385 --> 01:11:39.089
<i>Woo her.</i>

01:12:17.830 --> 01:12:21.095
<i>Win her.</i>

01:13:29.100 --> 01:13:31.329
<i>Win her.</i>

01:13:55.795 --> 01:14:00.095
<i>Make her one of us.</i>

01:17:17.597 --> 01:17:21.268
<i>Lady,... do not be afraid.</i>

01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:27.035
Quiet,... quiet.

01:17:29.508 --> 01:17:31.939
How like you my gifts?

01:17:33.545 --> 01:17:36.142
Does the gown not please you?

01:17:38.283 --> 01:17:39.777
No.

01:17:42.355 --> 01:17:46.031
Can you speak so of your bridal gown?

01:17:46.826 --> 01:17:49.462
I've found my true mate,

01:17:49.959 --> 01:17:52.264
and you know it.

01:17:52.264 --> 01:17:58.461
- Never.
- Beneath the skin, we are already... one.

01:18:00.606 --> 01:18:04.342
<i>- Was it not your sin trapped the Unicorn?
- No.</i>

01:18:04.639 --> 01:18:06.012
<i>Even now...</i>

01:18:06.012 --> 01:18:09.257
the evil seed of what you have done...

01:18:09.257 --> 01:18:14.690
- germinates within you.
- No. You lie.

01:18:15.231 --> 01:18:17.412
You disgust me.

01:18:23.963 --> 01:18:27.300
We are all animals, my lady.

01:18:27.712 --> 01:18:31.167
Most are too afraid to see it.

01:18:47.887 --> 01:18:48.704
Lily!

01:18:49.433 --> 01:18:50.163
Jack.

01:18:50.455 --> 01:18:52.792
<i>There's nothing you can do now to help her.</i>

01:18:53.423 --> 01:18:55.259
Be thankful she still lives.

01:18:56.161 --> 01:18:57.789
<i>You've got to help us, Jack.</i>

01:18:58.263 --> 01:19:02.559
<i>The last Unicorn dies tonight.</i>

01:19:03.536 --> 01:19:06.505
<i>- As her blood ebbs,
- Never.</i>

01:19:06.505 --> 01:19:09.775
the sun sets forever.

01:19:10.789 --> 01:19:14.947
<i>There shall never be another dawn.</i>

01:19:14.947 --> 01:19:16.046
<i>No!</i>

01:19:17.550 --> 01:19:23.122
<i>Lady, I require the solace of the shadows...</i>

01:19:23.626 --> 01:19:26.731
and the dark of the night.

01:19:27.626 --> 01:19:32.386
Sunshine is my destroyer!

01:19:38.237 --> 01:19:39.993
Damn you!

01:19:40.473 --> 01:19:44.671
We are all of us damned, my queen.

01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:50.383
As long as the sun still shines,

01:19:51.079 --> 01:19:53.048
we can destroy him.

01:19:54.553 --> 01:19:57.349
<i>Let me dazzle you with my wisdom.</i>

01:19:59.291 --> 01:20:00.925
I think I know a way.

01:20:06.165 --> 01:20:09.040
Come on, come on, come on.
You're holding us up.

01:20:09.101 --> 01:20:12.855
Listen to me. We're not going down
the same corridor umpteen times.

01:20:12.855 --> 01:20:15.307
- I think we should go that way.
- No, we're going this way.

01:20:15.307 --> 01:20:16.241
No, not me.

01:20:21.513 --> 01:20:23.878
- Let's go down there.
- Stay close to me now.

01:20:40.965 --> 01:20:42.568
- You know what?
- What?

01:20:42.568 --> 01:20:46.094
- I vote we run like hell.
- I second the motion.

01:20:48.674 --> 01:20:49.942
Screwball.

01:20:54.946 --> 01:20:56.187
Where were you?

01:20:56.187 --> 01:20:59.619
In another three flicks of a badger's tail,
we would have gone.

01:21:00.619 --> 01:21:03.555
While you're having fun, time goes by fast.

01:21:03.555 --> 01:21:07.693
Yeah, yeah, we found the mare,
and it's alive in the dungeon.

01:21:07.693 --> 01:21:09.631
Excellent. Excellent, you two!

01:21:09.728 --> 01:21:11.428
Thank you very much.

01:21:11.730 --> 01:21:14.433
<i>Now Jack has a plan, and a good one!</i>

01:21:14.433 --> 01:21:17.937
We must gather every
shining object we can find.

01:21:18.522 --> 01:21:21.703
We're going to bring light to darkness.

01:21:57.443 --> 01:21:58.877
Blunder.

01:22:16.428 --> 01:22:17.819
Blunder!

01:22:19.697 --> 01:22:20.824
Shh!

01:22:20.900 --> 01:22:23.755
Any more noise, and you're shish kebab.

01:22:23.969 --> 01:22:27.240
You do what we say, understand? Swear it.

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:31.610
I swear it on the festering
forelock of Nicodemus!

01:22:31.668 --> 01:22:35.410
Please, help. Help me.

01:22:38.117 --> 01:22:39.351
Thank you.

01:22:43.756 --> 01:22:47.159
<i>Judge me not so harshly, mistress.</i>

01:22:47.159 --> 01:22:50.329
<i>I invite you to share this supper.</i>

01:22:50.329 --> 01:22:53.560
<i>Look how sweet it is.</i>

01:23:56.262 --> 01:23:59.129
Hurry, hurry. Keep 'em comin'!
Come on, come on!

01:24:17.116 --> 01:24:18.085
Ow!

01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:27.481
- Brown Tom!
- Huh?

01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:11.525
<i>Gump? Gump!</i>

01:26:14.799 --> 01:26:18.475
<i>- Gump?
- Jack. Jack!</i>

01:26:23.769 --> 01:26:26.044
Three cheers for our champion!

01:26:26.044 --> 01:26:27.479
- Hip hip!
- Hooray!

01:26:27.479 --> 01:26:29.415
<i>- Hip hip!
- Hooray!</i>

01:26:29.415 --> 01:26:31.110
- Hip hip!
- Hooray!

01:26:57.209 --> 01:26:58.777
Now what, Jack?

01:26:59.389 --> 01:27:01.470
<i>Must go all the way out.</i>

01:27:04.282 --> 01:27:05.216
Light.

01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:10.218
Not much to hold on to.

01:27:10.222 --> 01:27:13.085
Take a pea pod pixie to make that climb.

01:27:20.298 --> 01:27:21.932
I'll do it.

01:27:24.469 --> 01:27:27.605
What's the matter? Ain't I
small enough for the job?

01:27:27.692 --> 01:27:30.742
No job is too small for my little brother.

01:27:30.742 --> 01:27:34.378
Please, Gump. Let me try.
I won't let you down.

01:27:36.415 --> 01:27:38.984
All right, all right. Do it, but be swift!

01:27:38.984 --> 01:27:42.407
Oh, oh, thank you, thank you.
You... you'll never regret it.

01:27:42.428 --> 01:27:45.377
- I always knew you'd be going
places, Screwball. - Yes.

01:27:54.565 --> 01:27:56.701
- Eat.
- I'm not hungry.

01:27:56.701 --> 01:27:58.031
You lie.

01:28:00.839 --> 01:28:03.108
Just to please me.

01:28:03.108 --> 01:28:05.276
I do nothing for your pleasure.

01:28:09.681 --> 01:28:11.315
All I wish...

01:28:11.583 --> 01:28:16.221
is for you to sit and talk with me.

01:28:16.221 --> 01:28:17.053
Sit?

01:28:20.959 --> 01:28:23.326
- Here?
- Yes.

01:28:24.695 --> 01:28:26.097
Please.

01:28:26.097 --> 01:28:28.225
- I prefer to stand.
- Sit!

01:28:32.571 --> 01:28:36.452
Or stand... As you wish.

01:28:36.694 --> 01:28:40.694
<i>It is enough that we are alone together.</i>

01:28:41.947 --> 01:28:43.781
Just the two of us.

01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:54.119
Some... simple conversation.

01:28:54.259 --> 01:28:56.428
I have nothing to talk about.

01:28:58.130 --> 01:29:00.940
You've stolen my dreams away.

01:29:01.633 --> 01:29:03.526
All things change, Lady.

01:29:05.604 --> 01:29:07.539
The dreams of youth...

01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:11.503
are the regrets of maturity.

01:29:13.879 --> 01:29:17.315
Dreams are my specialty.

01:29:17.612 --> 01:29:21.419
<i>Through dreams I influence mankind.</i>

01:29:22.123 --> 01:29:23.289
My dream...

01:29:24.289 --> 01:29:27.747
is of eternity with you.

01:29:30.462 --> 01:29:34.926
I offer you this rose, Princess...

01:29:37.736 --> 01:29:39.670
my heart,

01:29:40.739 --> 01:29:42.473
my soul,

01:29:43.742 --> 01:29:45.501
my love.

01:29:46.377 --> 01:29:47.738
Love?

01:30:03.629 --> 01:30:07.265
<i>Once I was content with solitude...</i>

01:30:07.922 --> 01:30:09.860
<i>until that moment...</i>

01:30:09.935 --> 01:30:13.701
<i>I felt your vivid presence.</i>

01:30:15.007 --> 01:30:16.550
<i>A little to the right.</i>

01:30:17.042 --> 01:30:19.409
<i>Left... Good!</i>

01:30:21.213 --> 01:30:25.585
It grows late... Sit.

01:30:27.125 --> 01:30:29.621
I value your thoughts.

01:30:29.918 --> 01:30:31.783
<i>Share them with me.</i>

01:31:12.597 --> 01:31:14.599
<i>- Sit?
- Sit.</i>

01:31:14.599 --> 01:31:18.332
- Nothing more than that?
- And talk with me.

01:31:29.046 --> 01:31:31.243
I think I'll stand, if you don't mind.

01:31:33.317 --> 01:31:35.845
Damn you!

01:31:36.922 --> 01:31:40.619
<i>No! Never! Never!</i>

01:32:00.912 --> 01:32:03.642
<i>I hear a throat begging to be cut.</i>

01:32:11.289 --> 01:32:13.956
Are you so... anxious...

01:32:14.325 --> 01:32:16.516
to see blood flow?

01:32:16.594 --> 01:32:21.165
As you are to drink it. Grant your
bride one wish on this night.

01:32:21.165 --> 01:32:22.567
You have but to ask.

01:32:22.567 --> 01:32:25.065
I will stay here with you as you wish.

01:32:27.605 --> 01:32:29.935
- But on one condition.
- Anything.

01:32:32.243 --> 01:32:34.374
I want to kill the Unicorn.

01:32:55.033 --> 01:32:57.480
I can't let that happen.

01:33:06.377 --> 01:33:08.300
In the beginning...

01:33:09.080 --> 01:33:12.242
there was nothing...

01:33:13.952 --> 01:33:17.635
a void of darkness,

01:33:18.623 --> 01:33:23.089
<i>a cold eternity of silence.</i>

01:33:24.329 --> 01:33:28.311
Jack, your greatest challenge is still to come.

01:33:28.800 --> 01:33:30.698
And we have not much time.

01:33:40.478 --> 01:33:44.482
When the perfect void was corrupted...

01:33:44.571 --> 01:33:46.284
<i>by light,</i>

01:33:46.459 --> 01:33:50.447
a great wailing was heard,

01:33:50.822 --> 01:33:55.092
and all the brethren fled in terror.

01:33:55.092 --> 01:33:56.022
Gump!

01:33:57.295 --> 01:34:01.231
Oona, fly up like the wind. It's time.

01:34:08.406 --> 01:34:09.369
Jack!

01:35:15.339 --> 01:35:17.239
<i>- Lily.
- Jack.</i>

01:35:17.341 --> 01:35:19.608
Judge her with your heart,

01:35:19.911 --> 01:35:21.604
<i>not your eyes.</i>

01:35:23.081 --> 01:35:25.015
Hear me,

01:35:25.383 --> 01:35:28.686
ye powers of the night!

01:35:29.177 --> 01:35:32.048
<i>We offer this sacrifice,</i>

01:35:32.457 --> 01:35:35.288
in honor of you,

01:35:35.994 --> 01:35:40.987
sanctified with blood...

01:35:42.267 --> 01:35:45.974
and with fire!

01:35:56.081 --> 01:36:02.153
<i>I pray you, Father, accept my sacrifice.</i>

01:36:02.422 --> 01:36:07.058
<i>Let light be forever extinguished.</i>

01:36:08.793 --> 01:36:12.564
<i>Let the age of darkness begin!</i>

01:36:13.664 --> 01:36:15.155
Come, Lady.

01:36:16.034 --> 01:36:21.901
The birth of a new world awaits your stroke.

01:36:23.374 --> 01:36:27.211
Let my offering be made of flesh and blood.

01:36:27.812 --> 01:36:31.850
She means to do it, Jack. She's one of them.

01:36:32.146 --> 01:36:37.072
- I am sister to the Fates.
- Kill her. Forget her.

01:36:37.588 --> 01:36:39.987
Think about the Unicorn.

01:36:48.365 --> 01:36:51.169
- Do it!
- Lily.

01:36:51.169 --> 01:36:56.129
- I'll do it.
- No!... No.

01:37:00.691 --> 01:37:02.477
I trust you, Lily.

01:37:03.081 --> 01:37:05.213
I'll always trust you.

01:37:08.386 --> 01:37:10.147
<i>Run!</i>

01:37:11.022 --> 01:37:14.282
Run! You're free!

01:37:15.593 --> 01:37:17.652
Darkness!

01:37:46.957 --> 01:37:48.994
What have we here?

01:37:50.288 --> 01:37:52.728
A little boy.

01:38:18.923 --> 01:38:21.914
Screwball! Screwball, wake up!

01:38:35.974 --> 01:38:38.670
Wake up, Screwball! Wake up!

01:38:39.477 --> 01:38:44.341
It's always a pleasure
to take a brave man's life.

01:38:47.652 --> 01:38:49.217
Wake up!

01:39:17.448 --> 01:39:21.710
Don't you know me, boy?

01:39:41.706 --> 01:39:44.670
- Quickly!
- What time is it?

01:39:44.542 --> 01:39:48.412
Every wolf suffers fleas.

01:39:48.112 --> 01:39:51.745
'Tis easy enough to scratch.

01:40:05.430 --> 01:40:09.061
Give it to me, boy!

01:40:30.421 --> 01:40:32.955
Father!

01:40:33.023 --> 01:40:36.183
Protect me!

01:40:46.671 --> 01:40:50.436
<i>You think you have won!</i>

01:40:52.175 --> 01:40:54.279
What is light...

01:40:54.371 --> 01:40:57.013
without dark?

01:40:57.949 --> 01:40:59.984
<i>What are you...</i>

01:40:59.984 --> 01:41:03.249
<i>without me?</i>

01:41:06.457 --> 01:41:10.633
I am a part of you all.

01:41:10.728 --> 01:41:14.709
<i>You can never defeat me.</i>

01:41:15.087 --> 01:41:17.335
<i>We are brothers...</i>

01:41:17.335 --> 01:41:19.237
eternal!

01:41:19.237 --> 01:41:24.037
Do it, Jack! Kill him! Kill him!

01:42:07.684 --> 01:42:09.887
<i>She's under a spell.</i>

01:42:09.956 --> 01:42:11.878
A powerful spell.

01:42:13.491 --> 01:42:15.082
Do something.

01:42:17.695 --> 01:42:20.023
Look what we've been through.

01:42:22.765 --> 01:42:24.602
Look who you are.

01:42:24.821 --> 01:42:26.871
Have faith in yourself.

01:42:26.928 --> 01:42:30.455
<i>It is the greatest lesson you have learned.</i>

01:42:30.841 --> 01:42:33.212
Only you can answer this riddle.

01:42:35.221 --> 01:42:36.544
<i>I'm a princess.</i>

01:42:37.348 --> 01:42:40.943
<i>It's my right to set a
challenge for my suitors.</i>

01:42:42.218 --> 01:42:45.885
<i>I will marry... whoever finds this ring.</i>

01:42:48.659 --> 01:42:51.386
We too have a promise to keep.

01:42:53.396 --> 01:42:55.763
Now fulfill your promise.

01:42:57.034 --> 01:42:58.603
I will miss you.

01:42:59.103 --> 01:43:02.029
- But don't forget us.
- Never.

01:44:57.788 --> 01:45:00.220
I love you, Lily.

01:45:01.692 --> 01:45:03.726
Come back to me.

01:45:06.363 --> 01:45:08.197
Come back to me.

01:45:17.074 --> 01:45:21.674
I... love... love you, Jack.

01:45:38.929 --> 01:45:40.520
I love you, Lily.

01:45:41.699 --> 01:45:43.997
I had such a terrible nightmare.

01:45:44.068 --> 01:45:45.636
Did you?

01:45:48.472 --> 01:45:50.406
It's over.

01:46:06.056 --> 01:46:09.489
Jack, was it all a dream?

01:46:09.960 --> 01:46:11.791
You're safe now.

01:46:15.665 --> 01:46:18.429
So many terrible things happened.

01:46:22.706 --> 01:46:25.410
I learned something about myself...

01:46:26.321 --> 01:46:28.305
and something about you.

01:46:28.579 --> 01:46:30.177
What's that?

01:46:30.848 --> 01:46:32.983
You belong here.

01:46:34.651 --> 01:46:36.876
You're my prince.

01:46:39.790 --> 01:46:44.060
- I'm only Jack.
- My Lord Jack.

01:47:24.435 --> 01:47:26.037
So you take that...

01:47:26.537 --> 01:47:29.505
and you keep it, treasure it.

01:47:30.941 --> 01:47:32.781
It's part of me.

01:47:37.085 --> 01:47:38.717
Can I come tomorrow?

01:47:40.217 --> 01:47:41.751
Of course.

01:47:43.287 --> 01:47:45.523
I'll be here.

01:47:46.123 --> 01:47:48.823
I'll always be here for you, Lily.

01:47:55.633 --> 01:47:57.567
Will you sing for me?

01:48:00.838 --> 01:48:03.307
<i>♪ Come down, sparrow ♪</i>

01:48:03.307 --> 01:48:05.676
