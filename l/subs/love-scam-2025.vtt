WEBVTT

00:44.458 --> 00:45.916
We think you're a good fit.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.708
It's a seven-day-a-week job,
from 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m.

00:48.791 --> 00:51.541
Salary is 800 euros a month.
You pay for your uniform and lunch.

00:51.625 --> 00:54.333
We give you meal vouchers,
but you return them the next day.

00:54.416 --> 00:55.291
Yes, that's fine.

00:55.375 --> 00:58.625
What will I do with meal vouchers anyway?
Except hold up grocery store lines.

00:59.500 --> 01:01.541
You said five minutes!

01:01.625 --> 01:02.958
He's still crying.

01:03.041 --> 01:04.458
Here, take him.

01:05.083 --> 01:06.500
-It's okay.
-Here you go.

01:06.583 --> 01:08.625
Here, his bottle and baby carrier.

01:08.708 --> 01:09.541
Thank you!

01:10.875 --> 01:15.208
Sorry. I was rushing for the interview.
I didn't know who to leave him with.

01:15.291 --> 01:18.958
But you do have a partner
you can leave the baby with?

01:20.625 --> 01:23.416
No, actually.
His mother isn't around because…

01:24.416 --> 01:26.041
His mom ran off.

01:26.125 --> 01:28.875
But listen, I really need this job.

01:30.291 --> 01:33.083
Please. I've got social workers
breathing down my neck.

01:34.583 --> 01:36.583
I'm all he's got. But he's a quiet baby.

01:36.666 --> 01:40.583
I take him to work with me sometimes.
He just sits there quietly.

01:40.666 --> 01:42.750
See? Got him! Look at that.

01:42.833 --> 01:44.125
Next!

01:46.416 --> 01:49.833
Let's hope your uncle found something.
He had an interview today too.

01:49.916 --> 01:50.750
Pick up, Vito!

01:50.833 --> 01:53.125
There he is. Let's hope it's good news.

01:53.208 --> 01:56.041
-It's your brother. The handsome one.
-We need it. Hey!

01:57.000 --> 02:00.916
Vito, it's an emergency! Come get me
from Piazza Municipio, at the tunnel exit!

02:01.000 --> 02:04.250
-Come here, you bastard! If I catch you--
-Oh God, they're huge!

02:06.250 --> 02:08.208
-If I catch you, you're dead!
-Excuse me!

02:18.458 --> 02:19.416
Vito! Over here!

02:19.500 --> 02:21.416
They're coming! Go!

02:21.500 --> 02:22.333
Bye!

02:22.416 --> 02:23.291
Hi, Napoleon!

02:23.375 --> 02:24.541
Yeah, "Hi, Napoleon!"

02:24.625 --> 02:28.083
Don't give me that look, Vito.
It's not my fault they're idiots.

02:28.166 --> 02:30.333
Sure, it's their fault
that they were buying a phone

02:30.416 --> 02:32.125
but found soap in the box.

02:32.208 --> 02:34.208
You need to ditch the phone scam.

02:34.291 --> 02:36.166
-Ugh!
-It should be me saying that. Ugh!

02:49.875 --> 02:51.166
Made it, honey.

02:51.250 --> 02:52.583
Come on. Get off.

02:53.375 --> 02:54.375
There we go.

02:55.208 --> 02:56.666
Take Napoleon for a second.

02:57.833 --> 03:00.916
-Go to Uncle for a sec. Just a sec.
-There we go. Okay.

03:01.000 --> 03:03.000
-I told you--
-Just for a second.

03:03.500 --> 03:06.708
Why are you holding him
like a bag of potatoes?

03:06.791 --> 03:07.916
-Take him!
-No!

03:08.000 --> 03:10.708
-I don't know how to hold him!
-Come here, son.

03:10.791 --> 03:13.166
He hates me. That's what it is.

03:13.250 --> 03:16.791
You just need to bond.
How can I ever count on you otherwise?

03:16.875 --> 03:19.125
I get it, but we gotta
share the responsibilities.

03:19.208 --> 03:21.250
I can't do everything.

03:21.333 --> 03:22.458
-A little each.
-Sure.

03:22.541 --> 03:24.041
I'll put the bags on the roof.

03:24.541 --> 03:28.166
Anna, Peppe. What are you doing?
Are you moving out too?

03:28.250 --> 03:31.000
Ah, Vito. They made us a good offer.

03:31.083 --> 03:33.208
Almost half of what we paid.

03:34.291 --> 03:35.416
That's not so good.

03:35.500 --> 03:38.833
-They asked us too, but we aren't selling.
-But how can you stay?

03:38.916 --> 03:41.666
First the cockroach infestation,
then the drainage issues.

03:41.750 --> 03:44.666
Now the city's saying
the building could collapse.

03:44.750 --> 03:47.625
Oh well, what can we say? Good luck.

03:47.708 --> 03:49.833
Good luck, Anna. Good luck, Peppe.

03:49.916 --> 03:51.166
Bye, Anna. Bye, Peppe.

03:51.833 --> 03:54.541
You guys need luck more than we do.

03:55.750 --> 03:56.583
Thank you.

03:57.416 --> 04:00.208
-Jesus, she's making me anxious.
-She's jinxing us.

04:00.291 --> 04:01.208
Right, honey?

04:01.291 --> 04:02.916
That leak's gotten worse.

04:03.500 --> 04:04.416
Get the umbrella.

04:04.500 --> 04:06.916
That guy from city hall is back.

04:07.000 --> 04:07.833
Again!

04:10.208 --> 04:11.166
Good morning, sir.

04:11.250 --> 04:12.375
Good morning.

04:13.208 --> 04:14.041
Don't worry.

04:14.125 --> 04:17.583
That crack has been here
since my grandfather built the place.

04:17.666 --> 04:21.000
And it looks like nobody's done
any maintenance to it since.

04:21.583 --> 04:23.416
Goodbye. Have a good day!

04:23.500 --> 04:24.708
Come on. Let's go.

04:24.791 --> 04:28.208
At least Luigino
is still on the second floor.

04:28.750 --> 04:29.958
We're all good.

04:30.041 --> 04:31.041
We're all good?

04:31.125 --> 04:33.291
-Here we go.
-We're home. See, honey?

04:34.416 --> 04:35.833
-Guys.
-Hey, Luigino.

04:35.916 --> 04:40.000
Can I leave Gennarino with you?
I can't take him to my new place.

04:40.083 --> 04:41.458
Where are we gonna put him?

04:42.166 --> 04:43.958
Hang on. Are you leaving too?

04:44.041 --> 04:47.458
Why don't you guys leave too?
This place is full of problems.

04:47.541 --> 04:49.916
Luigino, we grew up here. We're staying.

04:52.416 --> 04:53.250
All right.

04:54.208 --> 04:57.333
Don't count on Uncle to help us.
He'll get tired.

05:03.208 --> 05:04.291
The door.

05:04.875 --> 05:06.666
You go. I'm lying down.

05:06.750 --> 05:09.916
Can you at least open the door?
Can you do something?

05:14.291 --> 05:16.000
-Take your time.
-Whatever.

05:16.500 --> 05:17.416
Who is it?

05:19.625 --> 05:20.458
Morning.

05:20.541 --> 05:21.458
-Morning.
-Who is it?

05:21.541 --> 05:23.458
-Letter for Antonello Esposito.
-Who is it?

05:23.541 --> 05:25.916
-It's the mailman!
-Then say, "The mailman."

05:26.000 --> 05:27.208
Again?

05:27.291 --> 05:28.416
Jesus Christ.

05:29.666 --> 05:30.666
What is it?

05:30.750 --> 05:32.625
Just a fine. I'll pay it later.

05:33.291 --> 05:36.666
-But you lost your license six months ago.
-And they keep on coming.

05:40.000 --> 05:40.875
Let me see.

05:56.958 --> 05:58.458
Hold on, honey. Put these on.

06:01.666 --> 06:04.250
-Do you understand what this says?
-What?

06:04.333 --> 06:07.750
This place is going to auction
in less than a month. What did you do?

06:07.833 --> 06:10.583
Why do you always think
everything is my fault?

06:10.666 --> 06:11.500
I mean--

06:11.583 --> 06:12.583
Tell me why, then.

06:13.333 --> 06:16.375
Look. I'm gonna go lie down
for a bit, okay?

06:16.458 --> 06:18.000
Listen to me, half-wit.

06:18.083 --> 06:20.666
Courts don't just take
people's homes for no reason.

06:20.750 --> 06:22.250
Anything you need to tell me?

06:22.333 --> 06:24.250
What can I say?

06:26.875 --> 06:29.208
See if this has anything to do with it.

06:30.291 --> 06:33.541
-You didn't even open them?
-I was too scared to.

06:33.625 --> 06:34.833
You were too scared?

06:35.625 --> 06:36.666
-Oh.
-Yeah.

06:36.750 --> 06:38.916
Okay. Let's see
who you should be scared of.

06:43.791 --> 06:46.750
"De Leonardi Company."

06:46.833 --> 06:48.125
Who are these guys?

06:48.208 --> 06:49.708
Hey!

06:51.416 --> 06:54.000
-It says you owe them 50,000 euros.
-As if!

06:54.083 --> 06:56.333
Now do you get
why this place is going to auction?

06:56.416 --> 06:57.291
FORECLOSURE

06:57.375 --> 07:00.708
"Debt contracted
with the De Leonardi company?"

07:00.791 --> 07:04.500
-What the fuck have I done?!
-How the fuck do I know?! You tell me!

07:07.291 --> 07:10.166
What can I say, Vito?
I don't know who they are.

07:10.250 --> 07:12.541
Some guys asked me to find some frontmen.

07:13.041 --> 07:15.291
People already registered
as property owners,

07:15.375 --> 07:17.125
so they wouldn't seem too sketchy.

07:17.208 --> 07:19.708
They paid us 500 euros a month.
Your brother and I split it.

07:19.791 --> 07:24.041
I didn't know they'd take your house.
It seemed like a low-risk arrangement.

07:24.125 --> 07:27.375
A low-risk arrangement?
Since when is fronting low-risk?

07:27.458 --> 07:30.041
-Well…
-So being a front isn't low-risk?

07:30.125 --> 07:32.041
No, it isn't low-risk, Salvatore!

07:32.125 --> 07:33.750
-All right.
-I didn't know.

07:33.833 --> 07:36.791
-Antoné, we have to talk to De Leonardi.
-How?

07:36.875 --> 07:38.833
We can explain what you two did.

07:44.333 --> 07:46.166
I've done all that I can.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.125
I mentioned that you were here,

07:48.208 --> 07:50.791
but the sales director
and Mr. De Leonardi are out.

07:50.875 --> 07:52.750
-Only his daughter's here.
-That's fine.

07:52.833 --> 07:55.541
But her first available appointment
is in six weeks.

07:55.625 --> 07:58.000
-Six weeks?!
-No. We need to speak to her now.

07:58.083 --> 08:01.083
I wouldn't today. She has her hair up.
That means she's on edge.

08:02.083 --> 08:05.208
In the six months I've been here,
I've never seen her hair down.

08:06.250 --> 08:09.541
So basically,
she's been pissed off for six months.

08:09.625 --> 08:11.791
Don't be dramatic.
She's just a bit on edge.

08:11.875 --> 08:13.708
They're all workers, employees.

08:15.208 --> 08:19.041
So I'm always in the office,
even when I've got a 38-degree fever,

08:19.125 --> 08:21.625
and you can't even manage
to send an email?

08:21.708 --> 08:23.208
I mean, there are five of you!

08:23.291 --> 08:24.625
You've had eight hours,

08:24.708 --> 08:27.750
and you haven't even managed
to send a damn email!

08:27.833 --> 08:30.000
-She's a bit stressed.
-Just a bit.

08:30.083 --> 08:33.083
I want those documents on my desk
by tomorrow morning!

08:34.958 --> 08:35.791
That's her.

08:35.875 --> 08:38.000
-Thanks. We got that. Her photo…
-There's a…

08:41.083 --> 08:42.458
-Come on!
-Where are you going?

08:42.541 --> 08:44.083
Her hair's up. She's on edge.

08:44.166 --> 08:46.583
We're in trouble! We have to talk to her.

08:46.666 --> 08:48.833
-We'll lose our home if we don't!
-Her hair is up.

08:54.291 --> 08:55.250
Yes.

08:56.125 --> 08:57.375
You forgot something.

08:57.458 --> 08:59.208
Thank you. I'm sorry.

08:59.291 --> 09:01.916
-Look what you made me do.
-Very kind of you.

09:02.000 --> 09:05.125
This isn't the time.
Let's go. Excuse us. Sorry.

09:07.666 --> 09:09.833
That's her car! Run!

09:12.541 --> 09:14.291
Our scooter's been stolen!

09:14.375 --> 09:15.625
The scooter's over there.

09:21.291 --> 09:23.666
When she stops, we'll tell her.
I hope she understands.

09:23.750 --> 09:26.833
Yeah. They'll see the baby
and stop the auction.

09:27.333 --> 09:30.125
Don't worry, Napoleon.
We'll get it all sorted.

09:33.708 --> 09:35.583
They're going that way. Stay on them.

09:48.541 --> 09:49.458
Let's go.

09:51.458 --> 09:52.541
There they are.

09:53.458 --> 09:54.375
This way, ma'am.

09:54.458 --> 09:56.125
DE LEONARDI FOUNDATION CHARITY EVENT

09:56.208 --> 09:57.541
A photo, please.

10:02.041 --> 10:05.041
-Check this place out.
-Good evening. Evening.

10:05.125 --> 10:07.541
-Good evening.
-They're taking our photo, honey.

10:07.625 --> 10:09.500
-Look. They're taking our photo.
-There.

10:09.583 --> 10:12.916
Excuse me. We have a baby.
Just a moment. Pardon me.

10:13.000 --> 10:14.166
-Good evening.
-Evening.

10:14.250 --> 10:15.583
-Good evening.
-Your names?

10:16.375 --> 10:17.791
-Sorrentino.
-…tino!

10:17.875 --> 10:19.166
-It's not on the list.
-What?

10:19.250 --> 10:21.875
-It should be. Look carefully.
-You aren't on the list.

10:21.958 --> 10:23.875
-I'm sorry. We were lying.
-Really?

10:23.958 --> 10:26.791
We need to talk to De Leonardi.
It'll only take a second.

10:26.875 --> 10:29.416
-You have to leave.
-Please. We'll be quick.

10:29.500 --> 10:31.375
-Please step aside.
-We'll be really--

10:31.458 --> 10:33.458
-This isn't your night.
-Please.

10:33.541 --> 10:35.250
Where are your manners?

10:35.833 --> 10:37.750
-Such a noble initiative.
-Thank you.

10:37.833 --> 10:41.208
But really, it's all down
to my daughter Marina.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.458
I don't know how she runs the foundation
while being the best in the company.

10:46.208 --> 10:49.416
She's currently working on a hotel.
It's more than just a building.

10:49.500 --> 10:50.750
It's an experience.

10:50.833 --> 10:53.416
It's just the first step
of a much bigger plan

10:53.500 --> 10:55.375
to redevelop an entire area, right?

10:55.458 --> 10:57.375
That's the ambition, yes.

10:57.875 --> 10:59.458
But without Mr. Spagnoli,

10:59.541 --> 11:02.375
it'd be nothing more
than a project on my computer.

11:02.958 --> 11:06.375
No, I just handle
the administrative and financial side.

11:06.458 --> 11:09.541
These two are gonna steal my seat
and give me a grandchild,

11:09.625 --> 11:11.041
so I can finally retire.

11:11.125 --> 11:13.750
-I'll believe that when I see it.
-You'll see.

11:13.833 --> 11:16.416
-We'll leave you to it.
-Yes, see you later.

11:18.416 --> 11:20.166
-Go ahead.
-Good evening.

11:21.875 --> 11:23.333
-Good evening.
-Evening.

11:23.416 --> 11:25.750
They're letting everyone in but us.

11:25.833 --> 11:29.125
No wonder they won't let us in.
You look like a burglar in those glasses.

11:29.208 --> 11:30.083
A burglar!

11:31.583 --> 11:32.666
Now what do we do?

11:35.000 --> 11:37.750
I've got an idea. Come with me! Follow me!

11:38.250 --> 11:40.416
You want to talk to her? Humor me.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.333
Fine. Just don't make another scene.

11:43.541 --> 11:44.833
-Hi, guys.
-Hi.

11:44.916 --> 11:46.500
-My brother's with me.
-No worries.

11:46.583 --> 11:48.250
-I'm with him.
-Go on. Bye.

11:49.458 --> 11:50.375
Yes!

11:56.875 --> 11:57.875
Go on.

11:58.375 --> 11:59.750
Wow, look at this place.

12:01.041 --> 12:03.041
Jesus. What is this, a wedding?

12:03.125 --> 12:05.166
Look at all this stuff.

12:05.250 --> 12:06.458
Look at that.

12:07.875 --> 12:09.750
Listen, take Napoleon for a second.

12:09.833 --> 12:11.500
-No. I don't know how.
-Go on.

12:11.583 --> 12:13.750
-I'll sort this out.
-I make him cry.

12:13.833 --> 12:16.666
He's not crying.
He'll calm down. Hold him properly.

12:16.750 --> 12:19.416
-Let's go--
-Look what Uncle found!

12:19.500 --> 12:20.750
The carousel.

12:20.833 --> 12:22.791
-Hey!
-Be careful.

12:22.875 --> 12:25.125
The carousel! Look!

12:28.208 --> 12:29.458
There she is, Antoné.

12:30.041 --> 12:30.958
Antoné.

12:31.458 --> 12:32.291
Antoné!

12:32.375 --> 12:33.750
-Hey.
-Come here.

12:37.333 --> 12:39.375
-Look how elegant she is.
-Beautiful.

12:39.458 --> 12:42.083
-And she likes poor people too.
-They've put on a show.

12:42.166 --> 12:44.291
And look, the Indian kid, the stuff…

12:45.083 --> 12:46.958
-I'm gonna go talk to her.
-And say what?

12:47.041 --> 12:49.583
I'll say, "Ms. De Leonardi,
we've been scammed."

12:49.666 --> 12:50.791
-Yes.
-"It's not your fault."

12:50.875 --> 12:52.125
-No.
-No.

12:52.208 --> 12:55.083
-Hopefully she'll feel sorry for us.
-We're good at that.

12:55.166 --> 12:57.375
Go on! Go! What's wrong?

12:57.458 --> 12:58.583
Napoleon…

12:58.666 --> 12:59.833
Oh fuck, Napoleon!

13:00.750 --> 13:01.750
Napoleon!

13:02.583 --> 13:03.583
Napoleon!

13:05.208 --> 13:07.875
Excuse me! Napoleo--
It's fine. Thank you.

13:08.958 --> 13:11.666
Dear God, the hotel
is all my dad is talking about.

13:11.750 --> 13:12.958
Sorry. Excuse me.

13:13.041 --> 13:16.333
We haven't even signed
with the investors yet.

13:19.333 --> 13:22.000
He gave us the hotel project
to test us, didn't he?

13:22.083 --> 13:24.875
We're gonna show him
that he can retire peacefully.

13:26.083 --> 13:26.916
All good.

13:27.000 --> 13:28.958
Yes, but this is a charity event.

13:29.458 --> 13:31.625
Can't he forget about work
for five minutes?

13:31.708 --> 13:32.833
Excuse me.

13:32.916 --> 13:34.208
Nothing?

13:34.291 --> 13:37.375
Marina, we have to focus
on our goal right now.

13:37.458 --> 13:39.958
Come on. Focus.

13:41.333 --> 13:43.416
-Focus.
-Napoleon!

13:43.500 --> 13:44.458
Antoné!

13:44.541 --> 13:45.708
Excuse me.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.750
Excuse me. Just a moment.

13:51.791 --> 13:54.500
Come on, honey.
What are you doing? Daddy found you.

13:54.583 --> 13:56.625
-Oh my God!
-Daddy found you!

13:56.708 --> 13:59.000
-I'll never leave you again!
-Why was a baby there?

13:59.083 --> 14:00.625
-Thank you.
-Look where he was!

14:08.666 --> 14:09.541
Good evening, ma'am--

14:11.000 --> 14:12.666
I'm such a buffoon!

14:12.750 --> 14:13.916
I'm sorry, ma'am.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.375
I'm always causing trouble.

14:16.625 --> 14:18.666
I am mortified, ma'am. Are you hurt?

14:19.958 --> 14:21.000
No.

14:21.708 --> 14:24.166
What the hell did you do? Come here.

14:24.250 --> 14:26.291
I'm sorry. No, everything's fine.

14:26.375 --> 14:28.125
Is it stained, ma'am?

14:32.958 --> 14:34.041
-You think?
-Yes.

14:36.708 --> 14:37.541
It's fine.

14:38.125 --> 14:40.291
-What the hell did you do?
-Nothing.

14:40.375 --> 14:42.166
They're a family of assholes.

14:42.250 --> 14:45.458
They don't even see people like us.
It's impossible to talk to them.

14:45.541 --> 14:48.291
So what do we do?
Lose the house and all our stuff?

14:50.166 --> 14:51.208
I'm going to work.

14:51.291 --> 14:53.916
Because I've always earned
what little I have.

14:54.708 --> 14:56.375
Try to fix this, Antoné.

14:56.875 --> 14:59.541
You created it,
so you have to fix it. Got it?

15:00.958 --> 15:02.666
Go back in and talk to her!

15:16.333 --> 15:17.166
Come on.

15:18.500 --> 15:22.625
We'll just sit here a while, okay?
That way, Daddy can do what he needs to.

15:23.791 --> 15:25.791
Do you like your bed? Come on.

15:28.083 --> 15:31.250
There we go. Good boy.
Look what Daddy's got now.

15:32.583 --> 15:35.416
Look what I've got for you.
Traviata or Rigoletto?

15:35.500 --> 15:38.125
Rigoletto. You're so cute, sweetie!

15:59.875 --> 16:01.375
I knew I could unlock it!

16:06.416 --> 16:07.833
Look at all this wealth.

16:07.916 --> 16:09.625
It's disgusting. Oh my God.

16:11.791 --> 16:12.625
Charity.

16:14.458 --> 16:15.416
Charity…

16:28.791 --> 16:31.416
I've found the solution! I'm a genius!

16:36.166 --> 16:37.000
Hey, Vito.

16:37.625 --> 16:40.458
-Is it just you? Am I disturbing you?
-Why are you here?

16:41.041 --> 16:41.875
So…

16:44.166 --> 16:45.416
Whose phone is that?

16:45.500 --> 16:46.791
Don't get mad.

16:46.875 --> 16:48.708
It's that De Leonardi chick's.

16:50.750 --> 16:53.875
-You're such a dick. Why'd you take it?
-It was instinct.

16:53.958 --> 16:57.041
An instinct for nonsense!
You're such a tool!

16:57.541 --> 17:00.500
Go and give her
her phone back right now, please.

17:01.333 --> 17:05.041
What if I were to say that I wanted
my foundation to fund charity projects?

17:05.125 --> 17:07.041
What if I were to say you were wasted?

17:07.125 --> 17:10.500
That's what she wrote
at 5:45 p.m. on February 26th.

17:10.583 --> 17:12.833
I've been going through her phone.

17:12.916 --> 17:14.791
-You told me to find a solution.
-Yes.

17:14.875 --> 17:15.875
I found one.

17:15.958 --> 17:20.208
This is a woman who gives
10,000 euros a year to a dog shelter.

17:20.291 --> 17:22.333
She gives to charity
to clear her conscience.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.333
Because she's too fortunate, you know?

17:24.416 --> 17:28.750
So we need to get a nice, big donation
from her too. Understand?

17:28.833 --> 17:33.375
But to get her to hand over the big bucks,
we need to gain her trust.

17:33.458 --> 17:35.416
Her trust. Right.

17:36.208 --> 17:38.750
You do realize we can't screw up anymore?

17:38.833 --> 17:41.625
This phone has a location tracker.
Take it back!

17:41.708 --> 17:44.583
I turned off the GPS,
did a backup, everything.

17:44.666 --> 17:47.583
But just listen to me.
She studied in London.

17:47.666 --> 17:49.625
She's back in Naples, but always working.

17:49.708 --> 17:52.958
She hasn't got any friends.
And that's where you come in.

17:53.916 --> 17:56.541
She hasn't got any friends,
but she's got a nice boyfriend.

17:56.625 --> 17:57.583
A nice boyfriend!

17:57.666 --> 18:01.541
Federico Spagnoli. Born in Naples in 1991.
Her dad's right-hand man.

18:01.625 --> 18:05.166
You should read their messages.
Nothing but work. Dead boring!

18:06.666 --> 18:08.458
-Vito.
-Yeah?

18:08.541 --> 18:09.791
We know everything. Look.

18:09.875 --> 18:12.250
Lives with her dad.
House-hunting with Federico.

18:12.333 --> 18:16.083
Gets up at six. Does yoga twice a week.
She's crazy about Mengoni.

18:16.166 --> 18:18.583
We can use this to get close to her.

18:18.666 --> 18:21.458
She'll trust us
and give us the money we owe her dad.

18:23.041 --> 18:24.958
-Antonello--
-No, don't call me that.

18:25.041 --> 18:29.250
-That's your name. What should I call you?
-That's what they call me in court.

18:29.333 --> 18:31.000
Say "Antoné,"

18:31.083 --> 18:32.083
or "Antó,"

18:32.166 --> 18:33.416
or even "Lello."

18:33.500 --> 18:34.333
No, not Lello.

18:34.416 --> 18:37.291
I don't think anyone takes
guys called Lello seriously.

18:38.833 --> 18:39.875
Lello,

18:41.083 --> 18:42.375
this all sounds like crap.

18:50.416 --> 18:51.250
Vito.

18:52.541 --> 18:53.375
Vito.

18:54.208 --> 18:55.166
-Vito!
-Who is it?

18:55.750 --> 18:57.458
Good morning. Coffee?

18:59.291 --> 19:00.375
-Coffee?
-Yes.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.208
Take it. It's hot.

19:05.958 --> 19:07.625
-Tuesday, the rich--
-This again?

19:07.708 --> 19:11.458
She's going to view a house.
It's the perfect opportunity to meet her.

19:11.541 --> 19:12.458
I said no!

19:12.541 --> 19:16.291
I'm done with women
after that bitch left me with Napoleon.

19:18.333 --> 19:20.625
-Was that the door?
-What time is it?

19:20.708 --> 19:21.541
Who rang?

19:21.625 --> 19:23.458
Social services! Get Napoleon!

19:23.541 --> 19:26.375
-I have to get Napoleon?
-Put him in a nice outfit!

19:26.458 --> 19:28.666
Yeah, he's awake. Coming!

19:30.625 --> 19:33.833
Sorry, it's a bit of a mess.
The cleaning lady's coming soon.

19:33.916 --> 19:35.250
-One!
-Come in.

19:35.333 --> 19:36.958
Come in. This way.

19:37.041 --> 19:38.125
Two!

19:38.208 --> 19:41.708
We're doing some psychomotor exercises
with the baby. It helps him.

19:43.166 --> 19:44.291
Napoleon, honey.

19:45.708 --> 19:47.125
Hello. Good morning.

19:47.208 --> 19:48.125
Good morning.

19:49.125 --> 19:52.875
That's why he's doing that.
A little psychomotor activity to help him…

19:52.958 --> 19:55.416
It's theatrical. To aid creativity.

19:55.500 --> 19:57.625
Exactly. To give him
a greater understanding…

19:57.708 --> 19:58.875
-Greater. Yes.
-In life.

19:58.958 --> 20:00.791
A bit of personality.

20:00.875 --> 20:04.291
-And learn how to say no.
-Yes, and about himself in the world.

20:04.375 --> 20:05.208
There you go.

20:06.750 --> 20:08.041
-There.
-And work?

20:08.125 --> 20:10.250
So? Have you found anything better?

20:12.208 --> 20:15.166
Well, sir… I'm looking. I'm really trying.

20:15.250 --> 20:17.333
Vito, getting full custody is a big deal.

20:17.416 --> 20:20.916
Shouldn't it be a good thing
that he wants to look after the kid?

20:21.000 --> 20:23.541
Especially since what's-her-name
went back to Norway.

20:23.625 --> 20:26.500
Vito, the baby needs prospects, stability,

20:26.583 --> 20:29.791
and a part-time, under-the-table job
doesn't guarantee him that.

20:29.875 --> 20:31.666
-I know.
-We've noted your commitment.

20:31.750 --> 20:35.250
Owning a home plays a big part
in gaining custody.

20:35.791 --> 20:37.500
Nobody could take this place, right?

20:39.375 --> 20:40.875
Sure. Who's gonna take it?

20:41.416 --> 20:42.750
Right, Antoné?

20:43.333 --> 20:44.833
-It's ours.
-It's ours.

20:45.875 --> 20:48.083
The final court hearing is in a month.

20:48.166 --> 20:51.083
Let's try not to give the judge
any bad news.

20:51.166 --> 20:52.791
-No.
-Have a good day.

20:53.791 --> 20:55.083
Thank you, ma'am.

20:55.166 --> 20:56.750
I know the way, thank you.

21:02.541 --> 21:04.833
When is that rich lady
viewing the house again?

21:06.625 --> 21:07.458
Tuesday.

21:11.583 --> 21:12.916
Hand me the first one.

21:16.666 --> 21:20.583
It's too much.
I like it, but it's way too much.

21:20.666 --> 21:22.458
The sleeves are too short.

21:22.541 --> 21:23.791
Too preppy.

21:23.875 --> 21:27.458
-How do I look? Too flashy?
-Your tattoo shouldn't be showing.

21:27.541 --> 21:30.000
-It's nice, but--
-You've got to cover it.

21:30.083 --> 21:32.333
-I get it. Why shout?
-It's too street.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.916
-A Peppino di Capri suit.
-Worse than the last one.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.416
HOW YOU CAN HELP

21:37.500 --> 21:40.125
"Water nonprophit." Prophit…

21:40.208 --> 21:42.583
-"Profit." How did you spell it?
-I spelled it right.

21:42.666 --> 21:45.875
You have to pass for a rich guy.
To give it that touch of… you know?

21:45.958 --> 21:47.291
Would you wear that?

21:47.375 --> 21:48.666
-I would.
-I wouldn't.

21:48.750 --> 21:50.375
-Put me next to them.
-Here?

21:50.458 --> 21:52.416
Next to him. All three of us together.

21:54.541 --> 21:56.875
TUESDAY, 2:00 P.M.
APARTMENT VIEWING PIAZZA DEI MARTIRI

22:01.166 --> 22:02.458
Major charities?

22:02.541 --> 22:06.125
Emergency, UNICEF, WWF, Legambiente,
Doctors Without Borders, Greenpeace.

22:06.208 --> 22:07.291
Good job!

22:07.375 --> 22:08.458
Amazing!

22:08.541 --> 22:10.500
When do you change Napoleon's diaper?

22:10.583 --> 22:12.000
Whenever it stinks.

22:12.083 --> 22:14.666
-Whenever I smell shit?
-Good.

22:14.750 --> 22:19.041
"Everyone you meet is fighting a battle
you know nothing about."

22:19.125 --> 22:21.958
-"Be kind."
-That's written on her breakfast mug.

22:22.041 --> 22:23.083
-Yes.
-It's by Pluto.

22:23.166 --> 22:24.500
Yeah, Mickey Mouse! Plato!

22:24.583 --> 22:26.708
Whatever. Pluto, Plato. Same thing.

22:26.791 --> 22:28.333
Mandela quote?

22:29.625 --> 22:31.916
"I believe in humans
who have courage to be human."

22:32.000 --> 22:33.500
That was Mengoni!

22:33.583 --> 22:35.833
Jesus. Mengoni, Mandela, Pluto…
I can't keep up.

22:35.916 --> 22:37.166
No, you've got to study!

22:38.166 --> 22:39.208
No! There we go.

22:41.083 --> 22:41.916
Carlo?

22:42.500 --> 22:43.666
Carlo?

22:44.375 --> 22:47.333
-You're Carlo! If I call you, look at me!
-Why are you yelling?

22:47.416 --> 22:49.083
Because you aren't looking at me!

22:49.916 --> 22:51.291
-Can't my name be Vito?
-No!

22:51.375 --> 22:54.375
Vito is the name of her dog
that got run over.

22:54.458 --> 22:57.791
-Wanna be associated with a tragic death?
-And her crossing herself?

22:57.875 --> 22:58.708
Better not.

22:58.791 --> 23:02.208
Accosting her in a broken-down elevator
sucks as an idea. Just saying.

23:02.291 --> 23:04.833
-You feed him.
-Napoleon has to go to the pediatrician.

23:04.916 --> 23:08.291
I'll take him. But you've got to trust me.

23:08.375 --> 23:10.500
The elevator is a magical place.

23:10.583 --> 23:14.500
You'll share an emotion,
be bonded by an experience. You know?

23:14.583 --> 23:16.166
No doubt she'll start laughing.

23:16.875 --> 23:19.291
-"We're stuck!"
-"We're gonna get so sweaty!"

23:20.458 --> 23:22.875
Can you stop fooling around? "Sweaty…"

23:22.958 --> 23:26.083
Seriously. I mean,
it'll break the ice, you know?

23:26.166 --> 23:29.541
You can tell her about our nonprofit,
the charity project.

23:29.625 --> 23:31.500
But you've got to loosen up.

23:31.583 --> 23:33.541
I am Carlo.

23:34.333 --> 23:35.791
-I'm Carlo.
-There you go.

23:37.416 --> 23:38.750
This is gonna be a disaster.

23:49.208 --> 23:50.875
-They're here.
-It'll all be fine.

23:50.958 --> 23:53.708
Don't worry. I'll look after the baby.

23:58.750 --> 24:02.125
Excuse me. It's an emergency.
Can you please hold the baby for a second?

24:02.208 --> 24:04.416
I'll be right back. I just need to…

24:05.833 --> 24:08.291
Sure, he'll calm down with strangers.

24:13.583 --> 24:14.625
-Hello?
-Who is this?

24:14.708 --> 24:16.625
-Federico Spagnoli?
-Speaking. Who is this?

24:16.708 --> 24:20.166
Michelangelo Caputo, Naples Fire Chief.

24:20.666 --> 24:21.708
What's going on?

24:21.791 --> 24:23.666
It's an evacuation, ma'am. Get out.

24:25.333 --> 24:26.500
I'll be right there.

24:26.583 --> 24:30.000
It was the fire department. They said
there's a gas leak in my building.

24:30.083 --> 24:32.166
You go. I'll keep you updated.

24:32.250 --> 24:35.916
Oh, Marí? Remember, pending charges,
occupancy status, energy certificate,

24:36.000 --> 24:38.500
installations pre- or post-2011,
and lighting.

24:38.583 --> 24:40.875
-Marí, lighting.
-Lighting. Bye.

24:43.875 --> 24:45.500
Okay, he's gone. Let's go.

24:56.083 --> 24:58.291
Excuse me! Hold the elevator, please!

24:58.833 --> 24:59.750
Thank you.

24:59.833 --> 25:00.666
Yes.

25:00.750 --> 25:02.083
No, I was saying that

25:02.625 --> 25:05.500
the village well
has to be finished within the month.

25:05.583 --> 25:08.875
Of course. People are gonna
die of thirst otherwise. Yeah.

25:09.625 --> 25:10.750
Exactly.

25:11.250 --> 25:13.875
Our foundation covered all costs.
There's no problem.

25:15.416 --> 25:16.833
Elevator…

25:16.916 --> 25:19.708
I think the elevator is this one!

25:21.541 --> 25:24.666
-I don't believe this.
-Don't worry. It's all under control.

25:26.250 --> 25:27.083
What's wrong?

25:30.916 --> 25:32.125
What's going on?

25:32.708 --> 25:35.958
I don't know. But I think
we'll be back on our way soon.

25:39.750 --> 25:40.833
Nothing.

25:40.916 --> 25:42.583
-Do you have service?
-Sorry?

25:42.666 --> 25:45.291
-Service?
-Oh, do I have service? I'll check.

25:45.375 --> 25:46.833
No, I don't.

25:46.916 --> 25:49.208
What do you mean?
You were just on the phone.

25:49.291 --> 25:52.041
I get that, but how should I know?
I did earlier. Now I don't.

25:52.666 --> 25:54.083
Is anyone there?!

25:54.166 --> 25:55.375
Help!

25:55.458 --> 25:59.708
-We may as well make friends. I'm Carlo.
-Don't talk. It wastes oxygen.

25:59.791 --> 26:01.333
Anyway, I'm sure this--

26:01.416 --> 26:03.541
-Don't touch anything! Don't move!
-Good Lord.

26:03.625 --> 26:05.041
Listen, I'm claustrophobic.

26:05.125 --> 26:07.666
So, just stay quiet. Don't breathe.

26:07.750 --> 26:10.000
I'll try to relax
until someone arrives, okay?

26:10.083 --> 26:10.916
Okay.

26:12.416 --> 26:16.083
Sorry, but how does one not breathe?
That is absurd.

26:16.166 --> 26:18.625
I don't know about you,
but I'm always on the go.

26:18.708 --> 26:20.125
I never stop.

26:20.208 --> 26:23.958
Sometimes we're so wrapped up in ourselves
that we don't see who's in front of us.

26:24.041 --> 26:27.166
This should happen more often.
Something stops us, we look inside--

26:27.250 --> 26:29.666
-I think I'm having a panic attack.
-What?

26:29.750 --> 26:31.958
-I'm having a panic attack!
-Calm down.

26:32.041 --> 26:33.375
You know why I'm calm?

26:33.458 --> 26:38.291
Because even if we don't make it out,
with all my good deeds, I'll go to heaven.

26:38.375 --> 26:41.000
Volunteering, charity work,
all that stuff.

26:41.083 --> 26:42.458
Actually, if I may--

26:42.541 --> 26:44.875
Shut up, for fuck's sake!

26:44.958 --> 26:46.458
No, but I don't get it.

26:46.541 --> 26:49.458
You knew everything about her
except that she's claustrophobic?

26:49.541 --> 26:50.666
How was I meant to know?

26:50.750 --> 26:52.333
So if someone stole your phone,

26:52.416 --> 26:55.375
they'd know little old ladies
in floral dresses scare you?

26:55.458 --> 26:56.375
Come on!

26:58.875 --> 27:01.375
And I'm the idiot? She won't bite!

27:01.458 --> 27:03.500
I know, but she came out of nowhere.

27:03.583 --> 27:05.708
I still don't get what happened.

27:05.791 --> 27:08.041
I mean, help me understand. I just want…

27:08.125 --> 27:12.041
So you didn't even manage
to show her the website or anything?

27:12.125 --> 27:15.708
You don't get it. The website?
She was trying to strangle me!

27:15.791 --> 27:19.333
I worked so hard on the design.
A little appreciation, please!

27:19.416 --> 27:23.000
This whole thing is a disaster.
We look like idiots.

27:23.083 --> 27:26.625
Come on, Vito! Don't give up!
There's got to be a way!

27:28.666 --> 27:29.500
Antoné?

27:30.000 --> 27:30.875
Yeah?

27:30.958 --> 27:33.125
Are you sure
these aren't prescription glasses?

27:33.208 --> 27:34.625
My eyes are stinging.

27:35.375 --> 27:37.083
I don't know. Maybe a little.

27:37.166 --> 27:39.458
Are you an idiot? That can do damage!

27:40.333 --> 27:42.666
She's wearing her hair down here.

27:44.791 --> 27:45.750
And here.

27:46.250 --> 27:47.583
See? You like it.

27:53.416 --> 27:54.583
-Mom, this sauce…
-Vito!

27:54.666 --> 27:55.833
-Yeah?
-Come here.

27:55.916 --> 27:57.708
Look, she has her hair down.

27:57.791 --> 28:00.833
Well, of course she's happy
in a house like that.

28:00.916 --> 28:02.375
It's not about the house.

28:02.458 --> 28:05.625
I mean, she's usually pissed by default.

28:05.708 --> 28:07.916
-What is she doing here?
-She's cooking.

28:08.000 --> 28:09.958
Cooking, right! And here! And there!

28:10.041 --> 28:11.666
And I'm making milk. So?

28:11.750 --> 28:14.583
She must really like
this cooking thing. You know?

28:14.666 --> 28:17.125
When she can't sleep,
she watches Master Chef.

28:17.208 --> 28:20.000
If Federico suggests
they go to some restaurant,

28:20.083 --> 28:22.041
she's all smiles, tons of happy emojis.

28:22.125 --> 28:24.333
Yeah, I get it. She likes to eat. So?

28:24.416 --> 28:27.041
I lure her in with a sandwich
like she's a seagull?

28:27.125 --> 28:27.958
No.

28:28.791 --> 28:32.375
-But what do you have that others don't?
-A sense of dread and terror.

28:32.958 --> 28:34.000
Well, that too.

28:35.250 --> 28:37.625
But I was thinking about the restaurant.

28:38.916 --> 28:40.958
I'm the lowest asshole there, Antoné.

28:42.791 --> 28:44.500
-But she doesn't know that.
-Yeah.

28:45.083 --> 28:46.083
So?

28:47.833 --> 28:50.708
You already finished a pack!
Why do you eat the baby's stuff?

28:53.375 --> 28:54.666
What size are you?

28:55.791 --> 28:59.208
Take a deep breath. Exhale,
stick your tongue out, and look up.

29:12.708 --> 29:13.875
It's done.

29:16.750 --> 29:18.500
Upsy-daisy! There.

29:27.125 --> 29:29.291
All this effort,
and we're not even stealing it!

29:30.083 --> 29:32.333
There we go. Yes.

29:42.041 --> 29:45.250
-Municipal Police. How can I help you?
-Hello? Yes, good evening.

29:45.333 --> 29:48.458
Sorry to bother you,
but my sense of civic duty compels me

29:48.541 --> 29:51.916
to report a car that's parked
in a designated handicap space.

29:57.791 --> 29:59.958
Following people is illegal.

30:01.083 --> 30:03.125
Well, maybe you're the one following me.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.041
What are you doing?

30:11.125 --> 30:13.708
You think it's okay
to interrupt a class like this?

30:13.791 --> 30:18.500
I've never seen you before in my life,
and now I run into you twice in a week.

30:18.583 --> 30:22.208
You've obviously never done yoga,
so don't tell me you're here by chance.

30:23.750 --> 30:26.333
Well, maybe it's fate. What can I say?

30:26.416 --> 30:30.416
You know, there's this mysterious force
that makes people meet sometimes.

30:30.916 --> 30:34.375
Some call it "God," others "fate."
And some call it--

30:34.458 --> 30:36.583
"Stalking." It's called "stalking."

30:36.666 --> 30:38.541
Come on! Choose your words carefully.

30:39.041 --> 30:41.041
Do you really think
I was dying to see you again

30:41.125 --> 30:43.208
after you nearly killed me
in the elevator?

30:43.291 --> 30:44.541
Not sure if you remember…

30:45.375 --> 30:48.000
I just got back to Naples
after ten years abroad.

30:48.083 --> 30:51.041
I've got my nonprofit projects
keeping me up at night.

30:51.125 --> 30:54.541
So excuse me if I want to wind down
with a bit of yoga, all right?

30:56.083 --> 30:58.458
If it's a problem, I'll change studios.

30:58.958 --> 31:01.125
-Yes, good.
-Yes, good.

31:02.416 --> 31:03.875
What a pain in the ass.

31:04.750 --> 31:06.625
"Be kind. A battle…"

31:08.166 --> 31:09.250
Although…

31:09.333 --> 31:10.625
-Sh.
-No!

31:10.708 --> 31:12.250
You know, everyone you meet

31:12.333 --> 31:15.125
is fighting a battle
you know nothing about.

31:15.625 --> 31:16.625
Be kind.

31:18.041 --> 31:22.625
I've never parked in a handicap spot!
You bring my car back right now!

31:23.125 --> 31:23.958
But--

31:24.750 --> 31:28.083
-These guys are nuts. I have no words.
-Everything okay?

31:30.791 --> 31:35.625
No! They towed my car for no reason,
and I can't get it back until tomorrow.

31:36.208 --> 31:38.791
They'll make anything up
for extra money these days.

31:39.333 --> 31:43.250
Why is it that whenever you're around,
something happens? Are you a jinx?

31:43.333 --> 31:45.666
Maybe it's karma for treating me badly.

31:47.166 --> 31:48.583
Are you calling the police?

31:48.666 --> 31:50.125
No, I need a taxi.

31:50.208 --> 31:51.791
Well, good luck.

31:51.875 --> 31:53.750
A taxi in Naples at this hour?

31:53.833 --> 31:56.208
Please hold.
Your call is being put through…

31:56.291 --> 31:57.416
I can give you a ride.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.000
I don't take rides from strangers.

32:00.083 --> 32:02.041
Well, what are strangers anyway?

32:02.958 --> 32:05.458
Just friends you haven't met yet.

32:06.166 --> 32:09.416
Wait, let me get this straight.
Do you only speak in quotes?

32:10.000 --> 32:11.958
Do you want a ride or not?

32:12.791 --> 32:16.000
If something bothers you,
you can always strangle me again.

32:16.833 --> 32:19.250
An operator will be with you shortly.

32:24.500 --> 32:27.000
So, after volunteering in Senegal,

32:27.083 --> 32:30.375
I went to Ghana first, then the Gambia.

32:31.000 --> 32:34.791
I only really came back to Naples
to take my political science exams.

32:36.541 --> 32:38.000
Where did you study?

32:38.916 --> 32:40.041
What?

32:40.125 --> 32:42.333
I said, "Where did you study?"

32:43.041 --> 32:44.541
In London and Berkeley.

32:44.625 --> 32:45.458
Berkeley, nice!

32:45.541 --> 32:47.375
Yeah, but I missed Naples.

32:47.458 --> 32:48.375
Why did you leave?

32:48.458 --> 32:51.791
My dad insisted, so I left.

32:51.875 --> 32:55.291
I work for him now. I don't know
if you know the De Leonardi company.

32:55.375 --> 32:57.791
No, I don't. Is it a big company?

32:58.625 --> 32:59.833
Well, yeah.

33:00.458 --> 33:01.541
Never heard of it.

33:03.166 --> 33:05.916
Sorry, isn't this the long way around?

33:06.000 --> 33:08.708
Yes, if you don't mind.
I just need to stop by my restaurant.

33:08.791 --> 33:10.833
Caritas is coming to pick up some food.

33:10.916 --> 33:12.583
But I have to go home!

33:12.666 --> 33:14.625
You want to keep Caritas waiting?

33:18.166 --> 33:20.125
Can you please pass me those eggplants?

33:25.958 --> 33:27.625
They look good.

33:27.708 --> 33:29.125
Of course they're good.

33:30.666 --> 33:32.333
You think I'd give them bad food?

33:33.333 --> 33:34.958
Poverty isn't a crime.

33:35.041 --> 33:36.458
No, of course not!

33:36.541 --> 33:38.208
Look, I do charity work too.

33:39.041 --> 33:40.041
Really?

33:41.208 --> 33:42.166
Can you manage?

33:42.833 --> 33:46.916
Thank you, Carlo. You're an angel!
I don't know what we'd do without you!

33:47.000 --> 33:49.750
When someone is fortunate,
sharing is a duty.

33:49.833 --> 33:50.666
Thank you.

33:57.541 --> 33:58.625
I'll be off, then.

33:58.708 --> 33:59.666
Miss.

34:00.833 --> 34:01.791
Give me a moment.

34:02.541 --> 34:03.375
Salvatore.

34:03.458 --> 34:06.000
Bring those back in three hours. Got it?

34:06.083 --> 34:08.708
-And I counted them.
-A little trust wouldn't hurt.

34:08.791 --> 34:09.708
Trust…

34:10.583 --> 34:12.583
What do you have in here?

34:13.416 --> 34:14.875
This is trust, is it?

34:14.958 --> 34:16.666
Look, Vito, I can't help it!

34:18.291 --> 34:20.375
What can I do with this? Here, take it.

34:21.083 --> 34:22.916
-Thanks, Carlo!
-You're welcome.

34:25.291 --> 34:26.250
Done.

34:28.916 --> 34:32.458
Oh yeah, I wanted to show you something.

34:33.583 --> 34:35.916
This is Amidi and Katou.

34:36.833 --> 34:38.083
That's me with them.

34:39.041 --> 34:40.416
Look how cute they are.

34:40.500 --> 34:42.250
I left a piece of my heart there.

34:43.000 --> 34:45.958
The truth is,
we don't realize how lucky we are.

34:46.666 --> 34:50.750
I mean, even if we donated
just a small part of what we have,

34:51.333 --> 34:52.833
what would it change for us?

34:52.916 --> 34:57.125
But for them,
it could solve so many problems.

34:58.791 --> 35:01.083
-Right?
-Yes, that's nice. Really nice.

35:01.166 --> 35:03.000
But can you take me home now?

35:03.083 --> 35:04.458
-Come on.
-Of course. Sure.

35:06.166 --> 35:07.833
Oh, Marina! Sorry!

35:07.916 --> 35:11.291
I don't know about you, but I'm starving.
Want to grab a quick bite?

35:11.375 --> 35:14.250
-No, Carlo. I have to go home.
-Go on. Something quick.

35:14.333 --> 35:16.541
You can't ask me a question
and ignore the answer!

35:16.625 --> 35:18.708
-Your answers are predictable.
-Sorry?

35:21.500 --> 35:23.458
From the fuss you made
over accepting a ride,

35:23.541 --> 35:25.375
you clearly never do anything spontaneous.

35:26.333 --> 35:28.750
I bet you've already set your alarm
for the morning,

35:29.500 --> 35:31.458
booked your vacation for next summer,

35:32.416 --> 35:35.500
and you schedule dinners
with your boyfriend in your calendar.

35:36.000 --> 35:36.875
Am I wrong?

35:39.208 --> 35:40.958
How do you know I have a boyfriend?

35:43.875 --> 35:44.708
How do I know?

35:45.291 --> 35:46.583
Well, I know because…

35:50.041 --> 35:53.000
because for people like you,
love and work are top priorities.

35:53.500 --> 35:57.333
-You're probably house-hunting together.
-What do you mean, "people like me"?

35:58.458 --> 36:00.041
I'm not that predictable.

36:01.083 --> 36:02.125
-Oh really?
-Really.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.875
So if I asked you to make some pasta,
it wouldn't be out of the question?

36:11.291 --> 36:13.458
Yes, but I get to choose the pasta.

36:13.541 --> 36:14.708
Now, that's the spirit!

36:27.208 --> 36:28.916
"She's making eggplant…"

36:30.708 --> 36:32.166
Just eat it, Daddy!

36:32.250 --> 36:34.791
Eat it. It won't kill you.

36:37.125 --> 36:38.416
Have we gotta do everything?

36:45.250 --> 36:46.166
Do you think

36:46.958 --> 36:49.333
a splash of white wine
would go well with this?

36:49.958 --> 36:51.541
Well, you know…

36:52.041 --> 36:54.083
Come on, let's experiment.

36:57.750 --> 37:02.291
When I was little, my mom and I
loved making up new dishes.

37:02.791 --> 37:06.166
We ended up
with a book of recipes this thick.

37:08.375 --> 37:09.291
Is that so?

37:09.375 --> 37:11.541
She has to try this pasta, then.

37:13.291 --> 37:14.416
She died two years ago.

37:17.666 --> 37:19.000
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

37:19.083 --> 37:20.041
Come here.

37:20.125 --> 37:21.125
Try this.

37:27.125 --> 37:28.291
It looks great.

37:37.666 --> 37:39.833
Wow. We should put this on the menu!

37:40.625 --> 37:43.291
-You think it's that good?
-I swear. It's delicious.

37:43.375 --> 37:44.958
You know what? Wait here.

37:53.375 --> 37:54.791
Let me see. There we go.

37:55.291 --> 37:56.416
Now you're perfect.

37:56.500 --> 37:57.750
THE SHIP
RESTAURANT

37:57.833 --> 38:00.291
Why didn't you tell me her mom is dead?

38:00.375 --> 38:03.625
-You made me look like a jerk.
-You would've gotten soft.

38:03.708 --> 38:06.916
We need to be like ruthless ninjas.
No remorse.

38:07.958 --> 38:10.041
What ruthless ninjas, Antoné?

38:10.125 --> 38:11.708
You can't even talk to her.

38:11.791 --> 38:15.791
I was about to tell her about the charity,
and she just up and left.

38:16.583 --> 38:18.666
Ran like you do when you see a police car.

38:18.750 --> 38:20.208
When? I never run away!

38:20.291 --> 38:22.291
Will you stop messing around? Come here!

38:23.958 --> 38:25.125
What are you doing?

38:25.208 --> 38:26.375
Are you stupid?

38:27.625 --> 38:29.708
But you were right, you know?

38:29.791 --> 38:31.416
-About the cooking.
-I know.

38:31.916 --> 38:34.791
When she was cooking,
she almost seemed nice.

38:34.875 --> 38:37.250
I mean, even the spaghetti she made…

38:37.333 --> 38:39.458
She just threw it together,
but it was good.

38:39.541 --> 38:41.125
-Well…
-I can't explain it.

38:41.208 --> 38:44.291
You don't have to explain it.
We're not doing a tasting.

38:45.250 --> 38:48.000
I need to find the right time
to ask her for a donation.

38:48.583 --> 38:51.041
People make rash decisions
when they're happy.

38:56.791 --> 38:59.166
-Is she free for lunch on Wednesday?
-Why?

39:00.041 --> 39:02.416
The restaurant is closed on Wednesdays.

39:02.916 --> 39:05.000
A "Carlo" is insisting on talking to you.

39:05.083 --> 39:07.541
He's called three times.
Should I put him through?

39:08.041 --> 39:10.166
Yes. Yes, put him through.

39:12.250 --> 39:13.125
Francesco?

39:13.625 --> 39:15.583
-Can you remove these partitions?
-Sure.

39:17.791 --> 39:19.166
These are…

39:19.250 --> 39:21.250
-Hello?
-Hi, Marina. It's Carlo.

39:21.333 --> 39:23.916
Listen, I'm sorry to bother you at work.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.625
What are you doing?
Calling to apologize for calling?

39:27.125 --> 39:28.791
No, I was just being polite.

39:28.875 --> 39:32.791
Listen. I'm hosting a charity event
at the restaurant on Wednesday.

39:32.875 --> 39:35.583
And since that spaghetti yesterday
was so good,

39:35.666 --> 39:38.000
I was wondering if you'd like to cook.

39:39.291 --> 39:40.416
No, Carlo, I…

39:41.000 --> 39:43.291
I've never cooked for so many people.

39:43.916 --> 39:45.875
And I really don't have the time.

39:45.958 --> 39:47.250
Marina, I'm screwed.

39:48.041 --> 39:50.000
It's a disaster. My chef broke his arm.

39:52.041 --> 39:55.416
Both of his arms.
He's basically a vegetable.

39:55.500 --> 39:56.541
It's a tragedy.

39:56.625 --> 39:57.791
I wouldn't ask otherwise.

39:57.875 --> 40:01.541
Do you remember the project I mentioned?
The water system in the Gambia?

40:01.625 --> 40:05.083
If I don't manage to raise more money,
they're gonna shut it all down.

40:06.916 --> 40:10.000
Well, I mean, it would be nice, actually…

40:12.000 --> 40:12.958
But…

40:13.500 --> 40:14.750
Thank you.

40:16.583 --> 40:17.708
I can't.

40:17.791 --> 40:19.208
I'm really sorry.

40:19.291 --> 40:20.916
I'm not the right person.

40:28.291 --> 40:29.500
Listen, I don't know you,

40:29.583 --> 40:32.291
but from the little I've seen,
you're always in a rush.

40:34.166 --> 40:35.875
Know what my granddad used to say?

40:37.166 --> 40:40.750
That the best things in his life
were always unexpected.

40:43.041 --> 40:44.833
I've met you a couple of times,

40:45.666 --> 40:47.041
and you're always pissed.

40:47.750 --> 40:49.875
Well, not pissed, but tense.

40:51.291 --> 40:52.916
But when you were cooking yesterday,

40:53.000 --> 40:55.666
even with the smell of garlic and onions,
you seemed relaxed.

40:56.166 --> 40:58.083
You even cracked a smile at one point.

40:58.166 --> 41:01.166
And these days, a smile is no small thing.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.875
In a moment, you might

41:04.041 --> 41:05.958
find yourself in intensive care,

41:06.041 --> 41:08.833
and suddenly regret
all the times you said no.

41:09.333 --> 41:10.458
Excuse me, Marina?

41:12.208 --> 41:13.625
Listen, Carlo.

41:14.250 --> 41:15.958
I have to go, okay?

41:16.041 --> 41:18.208
So good luck.

41:18.291 --> 41:19.166
Bye.

41:32.958 --> 41:34.583
What the fuck was that?!

41:40.000 --> 41:41.583
Hey! Who was that on the phone?

41:43.583 --> 41:44.666
It was nothing.

41:45.958 --> 41:49.333
Someone asked me
to be the chef for a charity event.

41:50.125 --> 41:52.625
Just a guy
who runs a charity organization.

41:52.708 --> 41:53.625
What did you say?

41:54.958 --> 41:56.333
No. I said no.

41:56.416 --> 41:57.333
No. Right.

41:59.125 --> 42:00.375
-But--
-Come on, Marina!

42:00.458 --> 42:02.791
We need to focus on the hotel right now.

42:02.875 --> 42:05.083
I'm even working nights
to get everything sorted.

42:05.166 --> 42:06.500
Which is fine, of course.

42:06.583 --> 42:08.833
But you can't waste time
playing Master Chef

42:09.416 --> 42:10.583
Charity Edition!

42:10.666 --> 42:11.541
Come on!

42:12.541 --> 42:14.666
Focus!

42:20.958 --> 42:22.000
Excuse me.

42:22.583 --> 42:24.750
This came a short while ago.

42:34.250 --> 42:36.791
YOU FORGOT THIS
CARLO

43:02.750 --> 43:04.916
Mom, this sauce can be used tomorrow.

43:05.000 --> 43:07.750
Yeah, that way,
Dad can gain another three kilos.

43:10.833 --> 43:12.291
Hey, Mom. Let's cut it.

43:12.375 --> 43:13.458
It smells good!

43:14.458 --> 43:15.500
So good!

43:16.541 --> 43:18.583
I can't sleep. You?

43:18.666 --> 43:20.750
Ever seen anyone
sleep with their eyes open?

43:22.000 --> 43:26.166
I think some animals
sleep with their eyes open.

43:26.708 --> 43:27.833
Horses, I think.

43:28.541 --> 43:30.875
What are you on about?
They sleep standing up.

43:39.333 --> 43:40.375
Hey!

43:40.458 --> 43:41.666
-Yeah?
-Look.

43:44.000 --> 43:45.375
-No!
-Look at this.

43:47.041 --> 43:48.541
-Oh my God!
-She said yes!

43:48.625 --> 43:51.250
You're a genius
of international proportions!

43:51.333 --> 43:53.416
-International!
-She said yes!

43:54.000 --> 43:57.458
-She said yes!
-She said yes!

43:57.541 --> 43:58.458
-No!
-No!

44:00.083 --> 44:01.166
The budget…

44:05.958 --> 44:07.750
Wait, I can't carry everything!

44:09.041 --> 44:10.458
FIRST COURSE
MAIN COURSE

45:08.916 --> 45:10.541
-Look at this bottle.
-Okay.

45:10.625 --> 45:13.083
-Look.
-It's the same one as before. Yes.

45:13.875 --> 45:16.583
It's almost empty.
I say we drink the last drop.

45:16.666 --> 45:17.500
Go for it.

45:27.666 --> 45:30.083
You're out of your mind.

45:30.750 --> 45:31.708
Marina.

45:38.791 --> 45:41.625
Goddamn it. I don't believe this.

45:41.708 --> 45:43.166
A serenade was all we needed.

45:43.958 --> 45:45.208
No!

45:45.791 --> 45:47.583
I've never seen one!

45:47.666 --> 45:49.416
Marina!

45:52.250 --> 45:53.625
Marina!

45:57.666 --> 45:58.791
A glass for you, miss.

45:58.875 --> 46:01.458
I had to leave the car like that.
Do you understand?

46:03.583 --> 46:05.166
No, thanks. As if I had accepted.

46:05.250 --> 46:06.791
-But it's champagne!
-Okay. Thanks.

46:07.333 --> 46:09.958
Why are you always so stressed?

46:10.041 --> 46:11.166
I'm stressed?

46:11.250 --> 46:12.666
Well, yeah!

46:12.750 --> 46:14.458
-Can I tell you something?
-Yes.

46:15.166 --> 46:17.458
You're a bit of a drag at times.

46:17.541 --> 46:18.458
-Really?
-Yes.

46:20.375 --> 46:22.125
-Drink!
-No, I'll drink. You won't.

47:02.208 --> 47:04.541
-Sorry! Did you hit your head?
-Yes.

47:04.625 --> 47:07.916
Wow! Just a small studio apartment.

47:11.791 --> 47:13.166
There was a step there.

47:13.666 --> 47:17.666
-Where is your bedroom, Marina?
-At the end, on the right!

47:17.750 --> 47:19.250
-You know…
-Don't shout.

47:19.333 --> 47:22.833
If my father sees you,
there'll be hell to pay.

47:23.708 --> 47:26.500
You laugh, but let's make sure he doesn't.

47:26.583 --> 47:27.625
One, two, three.

47:36.416 --> 47:38.083
Okay. All right.

47:39.291 --> 47:41.375
Come on, let's take this off.

47:44.791 --> 47:46.000
And my shoes.

47:46.583 --> 47:48.291
And your shoes. Okay. Sure.

47:51.125 --> 47:51.958
One,

47:53.250 --> 47:54.083
two.

47:56.791 --> 47:58.625
I'll speak to you tomorrow, okay?

48:00.708 --> 48:01.583
Carlo!

48:01.666 --> 48:02.833
Did you call me?

48:03.708 --> 48:04.666
What's up?

48:09.458 --> 48:11.708
-I wanted to tell you…
-Yes?

48:12.291 --> 48:13.750
I had fun tonight.

48:17.875 --> 48:18.791
Good night.

48:18.875 --> 48:20.541
Speak to you tomorrow, okay?

48:24.000 --> 48:25.500
-Carlo?
-What?

48:26.416 --> 48:27.666
Damn!

48:31.416 --> 48:33.083
Marina? Have you seen Marina?

48:33.166 --> 48:34.333
-Morning.
-Morning.

48:37.583 --> 48:39.791
Listen, we just have to finish this,

48:39.875 --> 48:42.833
and then we can take a break, okay?

48:42.916 --> 48:43.916
Okay.

48:50.291 --> 48:52.083
We can make them au gratin.

48:53.958 --> 48:55.250
Mirrored!

48:56.916 --> 48:58.083
I mean,

48:58.625 --> 48:59.958
the ceilings.

49:00.041 --> 49:01.541
The hotel's ceilings.

49:02.541 --> 49:04.083
-We can make them--
-Mirrored.

49:05.583 --> 49:08.291
I'm gonna make some coffee.
I was up until…

49:08.375 --> 49:09.625
until late.

49:10.625 --> 49:12.083
Working on the project.

49:12.875 --> 49:15.833
Marina? Will you tell me
what's going on, please?

49:15.916 --> 49:17.958
No, nothing. I'm just tired.

49:18.541 --> 49:20.375
Is there anything I can do to help?

49:22.791 --> 49:24.875
You know I'm always here for you, right?

49:27.875 --> 49:28.708
Yes.

49:29.791 --> 49:30.750
Yes, I know.

49:31.375 --> 49:32.583
Listen, I was thinking.

49:32.666 --> 49:36.458
Why don't we go out for dinner tonight,
just the two of us?

49:37.000 --> 49:38.000
Total relaxation.

49:38.083 --> 49:41.416
Maybe we can take a look
at a few house listings, get a head start.

49:43.208 --> 49:45.250
I'm staying in to finish the rendering.

49:45.333 --> 49:47.375
-We'll fall behind otherwise.
-But we can--

49:47.458 --> 49:50.833
And I think we should put
the house-hunting on hold for now.

49:50.916 --> 49:52.541
-No!
-Just for now.

49:52.625 --> 49:55.750
So we can save our energy, you know?
You're always saying that.

49:57.000 --> 49:58.000
Focus!

50:02.750 --> 50:04.833
If we don't catch any fish,
no lunch tomorrow.

50:04.916 --> 50:08.333
I thought we'd be buying the fish,
not catching them.

50:08.416 --> 50:09.250
-Really?
-Really.

50:09.333 --> 50:10.541
Why? Isn't this better?

50:13.125 --> 50:14.250
Pass me that line.

50:14.333 --> 50:16.250
Sorry, isn't he the guy from Caritas?

50:18.083 --> 50:19.958
Him, the guy from Car--

50:20.041 --> 50:22.583
No, that's Mirko. They're brothers. Twins!

50:22.666 --> 50:23.500
I'm Mirko.

50:23.583 --> 50:27.125
-And I really can't stand poor people.
-Nice. Hand me the line.

50:27.208 --> 50:29.291
-I, Mirko, am giving him the line.
-The line!

50:29.375 --> 50:32.500
-Go on. Bye, Mirko. Thanks.
-We'll get arrested out here.

50:32.583 --> 50:34.291
Why did he say he hates the poor?

50:34.375 --> 50:37.458
He's just joking.
He's a prankster. He's a jokester.

50:38.250 --> 50:39.958
Maybe you should drive.

50:40.041 --> 50:43.208
-Are you nuts?
-It's easy. The open sea. Nobody around.

50:43.291 --> 50:45.625
Yeah, the captain of the Titanic
said the same.

50:45.708 --> 50:47.083
-Go ahead, Captain.
-No, Carlo!

50:47.166 --> 50:48.083
I let go. Go on.

50:51.291 --> 50:54.208
Diaper change! Yeah!

50:54.291 --> 50:56.791
Come on. Settle down.

50:56.875 --> 51:00.666
Just calm down a bit.
You've been crying for two hours.

51:00.750 --> 51:02.708
That way we can get some rest.

51:02.791 --> 51:05.541
Oh, come on!

51:08.416 --> 51:09.708
Oh, you're burning up.

51:11.958 --> 51:13.791
Wow. You're like a little furnace.

51:14.500 --> 51:15.625
What do I do now?

51:16.166 --> 51:18.625
Hang on. Go ahead. Take this.

51:18.708 --> 51:20.041
Now pass me that buoy.

51:21.500 --> 51:23.333
Can you manage? Come on.

51:23.916 --> 51:24.875
Well done.

51:29.708 --> 51:30.583
And now?

51:31.291 --> 51:32.166
What do we do?

51:32.250 --> 51:33.583
Now nothing. We wait.

51:34.958 --> 51:37.375
I forgot that you aren't used to waiting.

51:44.916 --> 51:47.583
It's your brother. The handsome one.
Pick up, Vito!

51:52.875 --> 51:57.208
How am I going to get rid
of the stench of fish?

51:57.291 --> 51:59.416
Fishermen usually use seawater.

52:01.583 --> 52:02.625
Seawater?

52:06.083 --> 52:07.000
Marina!

52:09.000 --> 52:11.041
She's not right in the head.

52:11.125 --> 52:11.958
Marina!

52:15.166 --> 52:16.500
Are you nuts?

52:17.125 --> 52:18.375
It's freezing!

52:18.458 --> 52:20.208
Wash up. You stink too!

52:20.791 --> 52:22.083
-Oh, I stink?
-Yeah!

52:22.166 --> 52:23.500
No!

52:44.250 --> 52:46.208
So, are you ready to head back?

52:49.833 --> 52:52.416
I'm not really in the mood
to go back to the office.

52:53.583 --> 52:54.541
No?

52:55.750 --> 52:57.250
We won't head back, then.

52:57.333 --> 53:00.000
You're the boss.
You can do whatever you want.

53:01.208 --> 53:02.500
It's not that simple.

53:04.166 --> 53:06.458
-Can I tell you something?
-Sure.

53:09.083 --> 53:11.458
Sometimes it seems like life chose you,

53:12.291 --> 53:13.541
not the other way around.

53:18.416 --> 53:20.416
We can't always do what we want.

53:22.958 --> 53:24.000
Can't we?

53:39.416 --> 53:41.833
Get that dog out of here! I've got a baby!

53:41.916 --> 53:43.125
Can you manage?

53:43.916 --> 53:45.375
Of course I can manage.

53:45.875 --> 53:46.958
-Where do I put it?
-On top.

53:48.833 --> 53:50.375
Vit-- Holy… What's his name?

53:50.875 --> 53:53.333
Carlo!

53:54.250 --> 53:55.208
Antonello!

53:55.916 --> 53:58.958
-What are you doing here?
-I called you 200 times!

53:59.041 --> 54:02.333
I was out at sea with her.
Why did you call? You brought the baby?

54:02.416 --> 54:04.625
-It's an emergency.
-What's the emergency?

54:04.708 --> 54:06.083
Napoleon has a fever of 37.2.

54:06.166 --> 54:07.333
-What? 37.2?!
-Yes!

54:07.416 --> 54:08.958
-Why?
-How should I know?

54:09.625 --> 54:13.291
Ah. See? He's got a new tooth coming in.
It's normal to have a fever.

54:13.375 --> 54:16.666
How would I know? Oh yeah!
That tooth wasn't there before.

54:16.750 --> 54:18.458
Right. Hand me that tissue.

54:18.541 --> 54:20.833
Couldn't you have told me it was a tooth?

54:20.916 --> 54:24.250
-Sure! What, "Uncle, I'm teething"?
-Well, he could've let me know.

54:24.333 --> 54:26.000
Don't make me look like an idiot.

54:26.500 --> 54:29.000
Surprise! Here we are.

54:29.083 --> 54:30.125
Hi.

54:30.750 --> 54:31.791
Hi.

54:31.875 --> 54:33.250
Look, Antonello. See?

54:33.333 --> 54:35.208
When he's sore from teething,

54:35.291 --> 54:37.208
just take a piece of ice,

54:37.958 --> 54:41.833
and just rest it on the tooth where…

54:41.916 --> 54:44.583
See? It's normal for him
to have a bit of a fever.

54:45.458 --> 54:47.500
Well, how was I supposed to know?

54:47.583 --> 54:50.083
Well, then, sorry.

54:51.166 --> 54:52.833
-Carry on--
-See you later.

54:52.916 --> 54:54.041
What's wrong, honey?

54:54.541 --> 54:56.166
We're here.

54:57.333 --> 54:58.375
A fever.

54:59.291 --> 55:00.833
He's my colleague.

55:00.916 --> 55:02.666
He's my son's babysitter.

55:04.916 --> 55:07.416
He's got a bit of a cough. What's up?

55:07.500 --> 55:09.125
What else don't I know about you?

55:10.791 --> 55:13.458
Well, this is definitely
the most important thing.

55:14.375 --> 55:15.333
Right, Napoleon?

55:16.416 --> 55:17.791
You named him Napoleon?

55:17.875 --> 55:20.208
Of course. He needed a strong name.

55:20.291 --> 55:23.750
So that's how you start
putting pressure on kids!

55:23.833 --> 55:25.291
Napoleon, I feel for you.

55:25.375 --> 55:26.791
Look! What's this, son?

55:30.750 --> 55:31.916
And his mom?

55:32.666 --> 55:34.500
Well, his mom was young.

55:35.833 --> 55:37.208
At first, she was smitten.

55:37.875 --> 55:41.000
When things got complicated,
she freaked out and…

55:43.500 --> 55:44.541
and here we are.

55:44.625 --> 55:47.208
Didn't you freak out
when things got complicated?

55:47.958 --> 55:49.291
I was shitting myself.

55:50.625 --> 55:51.458
But…

55:53.583 --> 55:54.583
But?

55:57.250 --> 55:59.166
Can you be half an hour late to work?

56:02.458 --> 56:04.666
Is that a yes? Yes?

56:05.333 --> 56:06.666
What do you say, Napoleon?

56:08.583 --> 56:09.958
-He said yes.
-He did?

56:10.041 --> 56:10.875
Yes.

56:21.666 --> 56:24.625
I remember when his mom told me
she was expecting Napoleon.

56:27.000 --> 56:28.958
I thought it was such a big deal.

56:29.041 --> 56:30.833
That I wouldn't be able to cope.

56:31.333 --> 56:32.666
So I came here.

56:34.750 --> 56:36.250
This place brings peace.

56:36.750 --> 56:39.000
It's called The Seven Works of Mercy.

56:40.125 --> 56:43.458
Think about Caravaggio
standing in front of this blank canvas.

56:45.083 --> 56:46.833
Imagine how scared he was.

56:46.916 --> 56:48.666
He probably thought, "Now what?"

56:49.541 --> 56:51.166
"What if it turns out terrible?"

56:53.500 --> 56:55.166
But he found the courage,

56:57.125 --> 56:58.625
and stroke by stroke,

56:58.708 --> 57:00.583
he created this masterpiece.

57:05.083 --> 57:06.875
In the end, it all depends on us.

57:08.833 --> 57:10.125
Not all, unfortunately.

57:12.958 --> 57:14.208
But a lot of things do.

57:28.250 --> 57:30.666
Nothing. She's not answering me either.

57:30.750 --> 57:32.833
I don't know what's up with her recently.

57:32.916 --> 57:34.791
She's stressed out about the hotel.

57:36.083 --> 57:37.541
How's it going, by the way?

57:37.625 --> 57:39.083
Well, what can I say?

57:39.583 --> 57:40.625
It's going great.

57:41.125 --> 57:44.125
In a week, that eyesore will be gone,
and our work can begin.

57:44.208 --> 57:46.333
An empty building
right in the city center.

57:46.916 --> 57:49.416
You did well. I've got to give you credit.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.416
Pull out the underpass, please.

57:58.458 --> 57:59.666
Look what I've got!

58:00.291 --> 58:01.791
Your toys, little one.

58:02.916 --> 58:04.583
Here you go. Play.

58:05.166 --> 58:06.666
Where were you?

58:07.291 --> 58:08.666
Where was I?

58:08.750 --> 58:10.083
We went for a walk.

58:12.333 --> 58:14.166
It was a long night.

58:15.416 --> 58:16.250
You think!

58:18.125 --> 58:20.125
Vito, you don't actually like her?

58:21.083 --> 58:25.583
-What? Are you kidding?
-Because we've got a plan to stick to.

58:26.333 --> 58:29.000
The lunch is today.
We can't afford any slip-ups.

58:30.458 --> 58:34.541
It's as if the guy who had to kill Hitler
suddenly fell in love with him.

58:35.750 --> 58:38.500
-The fuck kind of comparison is that?
-Oh, it fits.

58:38.583 --> 58:40.666
I'm going to have some coffee. I'm tired.

58:41.875 --> 58:44.833
You've got everything
under control, right?

58:44.916 --> 58:45.833
Yep, all good.

58:45.916 --> 58:49.000
Marina's not gonna notice
the millionaires are unemployed?

58:50.041 --> 58:51.708
She won't notice a thing.

58:53.875 --> 58:57.166
We'll use this. This one works.
This one needs to be finished.

58:57.250 --> 58:59.666
No! Eugenio! Get that Dior shirt off!

58:59.750 --> 59:03.666
The D's the wrong way around!
And it's like a dress on you! Put this on!

59:03.750 --> 59:06.583
Peppina! No!
How many times have I told you? No curls.

59:06.666 --> 59:08.833
Rich women get waves.

59:08.916 --> 59:11.416
But I can't style them all the same way!

59:11.500 --> 59:14.041
Rich women are all the same. Like a tribe.

59:14.125 --> 59:17.083
No! You can't wear that jacket.
Sasà, an elegant jacket!

59:17.166 --> 59:18.750
Already on it!

59:18.833 --> 59:21.291
No, ma'am, please.
Let's avoid floral dresses.

59:21.375 --> 59:22.583
My brother has a phobia.

59:22.666 --> 59:25.958
No! Not that hat. Take it off!
You look like Pablo Escobar!

59:26.041 --> 59:28.375
Damn it! I told you
to take off the glasses!

59:28.458 --> 59:31.875
The hotel that Marina designed
truly captures the city's spirit,

59:31.958 --> 59:34.000
blending the space into an organic form

59:34.083 --> 59:36.916
with a flexible,
multifunctional structure.

59:37.000 --> 59:39.291
-Everyone here!
-Over there!

59:39.375 --> 59:42.083
-Listen up!
-Come on! Move it!

59:42.166 --> 59:43.500
Come on!

59:43.583 --> 59:45.625
Come on! Let's go over the plan.

59:45.708 --> 59:48.916
Okay. At 1:00 p.m.,
the first-floor group will come in.

59:49.833 --> 59:52.125
Five minutes later,
those on the second floor.

59:52.208 --> 59:55.333
-All right!
-Then those on the third, and so on.

59:55.416 --> 59:56.958
Oh, and very important!

59:57.041 --> 59:57.875
What now?

59:57.958 --> 01:00:00.000
-No dialect.
-What does that mean?

01:00:00.083 --> 01:00:01.625
Don't speak in Neapolitan!

01:00:01.708 --> 01:00:02.750
-Right!
-Okay!

01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:06.208
…all designed
using eco-sustainable bio-construction.

01:00:06.291 --> 01:00:08.333
And this is crucial. Speak silently!

01:00:08.416 --> 01:00:11.541
-How do we speak silently?
-Yeah, how do we do that?

01:00:11.625 --> 01:00:12.458
Let's do this.

01:00:12.541 --> 01:00:15.083
Just don't talk at all. That's safer.

01:00:17.166 --> 01:00:19.250
Marina can explain it better than I can.

01:00:27.750 --> 01:00:29.583
I'm sorry, but I have to go.

01:00:29.666 --> 01:00:30.875
But, Marina?

01:00:30.958 --> 01:00:33.291
Mr. Spagnoli worked
on this project with me.

01:00:33.375 --> 01:00:34.833
He can explain everything.

01:00:34.916 --> 01:00:36.125
Again, my apologies.

01:00:40.208 --> 01:00:42.666
Well, then. Mr. Spagnoli, let's continue.

01:00:43.333 --> 01:00:45.083
Come on!

01:00:46.166 --> 01:00:47.125
Come on, let's go!

01:00:47.208 --> 01:00:48.541
What if I screw up?

01:00:48.625 --> 01:00:52.375
Then you can always go back to fishing.
Come on, let's go. Quick!

01:00:53.291 --> 01:00:54.291
We're here.

01:00:56.833 --> 01:00:57.666
Hello.

01:00:59.125 --> 01:01:01.000
The babysitter?

01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:03.833
-Yes. He's a jack-of-all-trades.
-Yeah.

01:01:03.916 --> 01:01:07.000
And I'm generous,
so I like to make myself available.

01:01:07.083 --> 01:01:08.750
I like to help others.

01:01:08.833 --> 01:01:11.250
And I've heard great things
about you, Chef.

01:01:12.666 --> 01:01:15.375
Sorry, Carlo,
but is your son gonna stay like that?

01:01:15.458 --> 01:01:16.416
Yeah. He's fine.

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.041
He's cool. He'll just sit
and play with the carrots.

01:01:19.125 --> 01:01:20.791
-Yes.
-All right. Let's start.

01:01:20.875 --> 01:01:23.625
You finish up here.
I cut the bread, prepped the veg.

01:01:23.708 --> 01:01:25.375
-Keep an eye on Napoleon.
-Go on.

01:01:26.625 --> 01:01:29.125
-Good luck, Chef!
-Make sure the service runs well!

01:01:38.708 --> 01:01:39.625
Eugenio!

01:01:39.708 --> 01:01:41.208
This isn't your house!

01:01:41.291 --> 01:01:44.416
Here. Don't put your elbows on… Like this!

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.666
Napkin on your lap. Watch him!

01:01:46.750 --> 01:01:48.166
Are you at home on the sofa?

01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:50.000
-Good evening!
-Hey, Luigino!

01:01:50.083 --> 01:01:52.916
Quiet! What's with the greetings?
Calm down!

01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.750
-I'm just saying hello.
-Sit here. Carmen, here.

01:02:06.291 --> 01:02:08.375
-Why are they all so quiet?
-What?

01:02:09.166 --> 01:02:10.333
Think they don't like it?

01:02:10.416 --> 01:02:14.791
No! She thinks-- Don't think that.
It's just manners, you know?

01:02:14.875 --> 01:02:16.416
And shyness.

01:02:16.500 --> 01:02:19.291
That's how they are.
But you'll see, they'll talk later.

01:02:19.375 --> 01:02:21.166
-Don't worry.
-You're sure?

01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:22.916
-Yes!
-Of course!

01:02:32.666 --> 01:02:34.458
It's like you're all dead!

01:02:34.541 --> 01:02:37.666
You've got to talk! Speak up a bit.

01:02:37.750 --> 01:02:40.041
-What should we say?
-No! Too much!

01:02:40.125 --> 01:02:41.833
Balance it out. Less here, more here.

01:02:45.666 --> 01:02:48.041
-Antonello.
-Don't use my name! "Waiter!"

01:02:48.125 --> 01:02:51.000
Sorry. We'd like
two more decomposed mille-feuilles.

01:02:51.083 --> 01:02:53.791
"Decomposed"? Deconstructed!
And no, you can't.

01:02:53.875 --> 01:02:55.625
Come on, Antonello, please.

01:02:57.958 --> 01:02:59.416
-Don't move.
-Thank you.

01:03:01.083 --> 01:03:02.458
Come stir the pasta.

01:03:03.458 --> 01:03:04.958
That's what I'm here for.

01:03:06.458 --> 01:03:07.625
Smell this.

01:03:11.416 --> 01:03:13.333
It's so weird. I don't know anyone.

01:03:13.875 --> 01:03:15.333
What do you mean, sorry?

01:03:15.416 --> 01:03:19.458
It's just that you usually see
the same people at charity events.

01:03:19.541 --> 01:03:22.750
Well, that's because people go
to charity events to be seen.

01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:24.583
I'm not interested in those people.

01:03:25.208 --> 01:03:29.083
But this place is full of good people
who like to do good on the down-low.

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:33.041
-It's ready.
-Excuse me!

01:03:33.125 --> 01:03:35.416
It was so good. Can we get an encore?

01:03:35.500 --> 01:03:39.291
Mr. Vitale, we'll bring it to you.
Antonello, make Mr. Vitale comfortable.

01:03:39.375 --> 01:03:42.333
We've got it, Mr. Vitale. Don't you worry.

01:03:42.416 --> 01:03:45.125
He liked it so much, he felt emboldened.

01:03:45.208 --> 01:03:48.583
Have you lost your mind?
Do you think this is self-service?!

01:03:48.666 --> 01:03:50.500
-No dessert for you!
-Please!

01:03:50.583 --> 01:03:52.708
"Please" what? No dessert! Sit down!

01:03:52.791 --> 01:03:54.000
-Antonello?
-Yes?

01:03:54.083 --> 01:03:55.416
I'll have his dessert.

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.625
No, it's best you don't.
I'm doing it for you.

01:03:59.083 --> 01:04:00.375
They're beautiful.

01:04:00.458 --> 01:04:01.708
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

01:04:02.208 --> 01:04:05.791
-So you think they liked it?
-Of course! Too much, maybe. Right, honey?

01:04:06.916 --> 01:04:07.750
I don't know.

01:04:08.333 --> 01:04:10.458
-It just seems strange.
-What?

01:04:12.166 --> 01:04:16.125
I'm gonna walk around the dining room
to see if they're happy.

01:04:16.208 --> 01:04:18.291
No! Wait, Marina.

01:04:18.375 --> 01:04:22.458
Listen to me. Better not.
These are private people. Come on.

01:04:22.541 --> 01:04:24.416
Don't worry. I'll be discreet.

01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.750
-Marina, I said no.
-What's wrong?

01:04:26.833 --> 01:04:28.208
No, it's just that…

01:04:29.083 --> 01:04:30.041
You've got a bit of…

01:04:30.125 --> 01:04:31.791
I don't want you to be disappointed.

01:04:33.458 --> 01:04:36.541
Okay? These people
don't show much enthusiasm.

01:04:37.958 --> 01:04:38.958
-Carlo.
-Yes?

01:04:39.041 --> 01:04:41.166
I'd always rather know the truth.

01:04:47.375 --> 01:04:48.250
Quiet.

01:05:02.375 --> 01:05:03.250
Hello.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:09.166
Hello.

01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:11.083
How's it going, sir?

01:05:22.375 --> 01:05:23.833
Go on!

01:05:23.916 --> 01:05:24.958
Come on!

01:05:25.041 --> 01:05:25.916
Wonderful!

01:05:29.875 --> 01:05:31.000
It's your turn now.

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:42.583
Well, everyone.

01:05:43.291 --> 01:05:46.916
I'd like to give you a brief introduction
to the Gambia water project,

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.958
before we move on to donations, of course.

01:05:49.583 --> 01:05:52.541
But first, how about
another round of applause for our chef?

01:05:56.291 --> 01:05:58.708
-Well done!
-Brava!

01:06:04.041 --> 01:06:05.041
Thank you.

01:06:06.208 --> 01:06:07.250
Thank you.

01:06:26.875 --> 01:06:28.375
YOU FORGOT THIS
CARLO

01:06:36.208 --> 01:06:38.000
All right, guys, we're off.

01:06:38.083 --> 01:06:41.458
It's late. Napoleon needs his nap.
Isn't that right?

01:06:42.291 --> 01:06:44.166
Bye, Antoné. See you at home. Thanks.

01:06:44.791 --> 01:06:46.083
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:06:50.833 --> 01:06:52.208
That was incredible.

01:06:54.916 --> 01:06:56.958
So? Did it go well?

01:06:58.750 --> 01:06:59.583
Yeah, sure.

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.708
Hey. What's wrong?

01:07:06.416 --> 01:07:08.875
You do everything to make things work,

01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:11.916
to do everything right.

01:07:15.125 --> 01:07:17.500
But in the end,
something always goes wrong.

01:07:20.208 --> 01:07:22.625
And the wrong people
always end up paying for it.

01:07:25.291 --> 01:07:26.375
Wait.

01:07:29.791 --> 01:07:32.291
You didn't manage
to raise everything you needed?

01:07:34.833 --> 01:07:35.666
No.

01:07:38.541 --> 01:07:39.583
All right, so?

01:07:40.625 --> 01:07:41.708
You're gonna give up?

01:07:44.541 --> 01:07:46.666
I don't know what else to do, Marina.

01:07:49.708 --> 01:07:51.000
I gave it my all.

01:07:58.125 --> 01:07:59.583
How much do you need?

01:08:04.916 --> 01:08:07.041
-There they are. Antonello!
-Good morning!

01:08:32.625 --> 01:08:34.500
Maybe we should go, Marina.

01:08:40.583 --> 01:08:41.500
Yes.

01:09:24.791 --> 01:09:25.625
Oh, joy!

01:09:30.083 --> 01:09:31.000
What a mess.

01:09:34.041 --> 01:09:36.041
I knew it. She won't give it to us?

01:09:37.250 --> 01:09:38.083
She will.

01:09:38.833 --> 01:09:40.375
Really? We did it!

01:09:40.458 --> 01:09:42.166
We're a couple of geniuses!

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:44.166
We're prodigies, Napoleon!

01:09:44.875 --> 01:09:47.291
-When is she giving it to us?
-Tomorrow morning.

01:09:48.208 --> 01:09:49.833
So why do you look so down?

01:09:49.916 --> 01:09:52.833
We can't take it, Antonello.
This has gotten out of hand.

01:09:52.916 --> 01:09:54.166
"Out of hand"?

01:09:54.250 --> 01:09:56.375
I can't do this to her.

01:09:56.458 --> 01:09:57.500
Marina trusts me.

01:09:57.583 --> 01:09:59.583
-Yes, that's the point.
-That is the point!

01:09:59.666 --> 01:10:02.166
You do know we're out of time, half-wit?

01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:05.916
The judge heard about the foreclosure.
If they take this place, we lose Napoleon.

01:10:08.833 --> 01:10:11.083
Give me Napoleon. Come on, sweetie.

01:10:11.166 --> 01:10:12.208
Give me the baby.

01:10:13.333 --> 01:10:14.541
He needs some fresh air.

01:10:17.708 --> 01:10:20.125
I said "half-wit,"
but you're a total idiot.

01:10:36.083 --> 01:10:37.583
You want the truth, Antoné?

01:10:43.250 --> 01:10:45.375
We thought we knew everything
about Marina.

01:10:46.791 --> 01:10:48.250
But we were completely clueless.

01:10:58.041 --> 01:10:59.000
Hi.

01:11:02.291 --> 01:11:03.458
I need to…

01:11:04.833 --> 01:11:05.958
I need to talk to you.

01:11:08.166 --> 01:11:09.708
I need to talk to you too.

01:11:10.833 --> 01:11:11.833
Vito!

01:11:12.333 --> 01:11:15.000
You can't let another woman
screw you over!

01:11:15.083 --> 01:11:18.000
That money means nothing to her!
It means everything to us!

01:11:23.708 --> 01:11:25.125
What are you going to do?

01:11:26.083 --> 01:11:27.083
Come here.

01:11:27.958 --> 01:11:28.833
Come on.

01:11:36.291 --> 01:11:39.416
When the social workers come
to take Napoleon,

01:11:41.291 --> 01:11:42.500
we'll already be gone.

01:11:43.333 --> 01:11:44.375
Far from here.

01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:49.041
I go back to being Vito today.

01:11:50.291 --> 01:11:51.791
This charade ends here.

01:12:28.916 --> 01:12:30.208
Who the fuck are you?

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:35.708
Take the baby.

01:12:37.708 --> 01:12:39.333
Marina, we were in trouble.

01:12:40.291 --> 01:12:42.125
We tried to find a solution.

01:12:48.791 --> 01:12:49.791
Was there…

01:12:52.250 --> 01:12:53.583
anything real, Carlo?

01:12:56.291 --> 01:12:57.666
Is that even your name?

01:13:06.833 --> 01:13:09.041
How the fuck did I ever trust you?

01:13:10.333 --> 01:13:11.166
Marina!

01:13:11.708 --> 01:13:13.958
If you contact me again,
I'll call the police.

01:13:30.750 --> 01:13:34.166
How did you let them scam you?
How could you be so naive?

01:13:34.666 --> 01:13:36.958
And by those two lowlifes.

01:13:37.833 --> 01:13:41.041
Your father doesn't need
to know about this, okay?

01:13:42.333 --> 01:13:44.541
Maybe now we can focus
on doing what's right.

01:14:27.666 --> 01:14:29.500
It's been in the works for seven years.

01:14:29.583 --> 01:14:32.916
And the architecture,
in this city in particular…

01:14:34.833 --> 01:14:36.000
Hey! Be careful.

01:15:08.541 --> 01:15:09.791
Iceland?

01:15:10.291 --> 01:15:13.125
We could open a fried food
and rum baba kiosk.

01:15:13.208 --> 01:15:14.291
In Iceland?

01:15:14.375 --> 01:15:15.708
It's fucking freezing.

01:15:16.208 --> 01:15:17.625
You've got a point.

01:15:17.708 --> 01:15:20.583
"Tallinn, flights from 19.90 euros."

01:15:21.958 --> 01:15:23.833
Where the fuck is Tallinn?

01:15:23.916 --> 01:15:25.250
Know what I say, Vito?

01:15:25.333 --> 01:15:28.375
Who the fuck cares?
We'll find out when we land.

01:15:28.458 --> 01:15:31.208
I've got a good feeling about Tallinn.
I like the name.

01:15:31.291 --> 01:15:32.291
"Where do you live?"

01:15:32.375 --> 01:15:34.958
"Oh, I've moved to Tallinn."

01:15:35.041 --> 01:15:37.583
Aren't you feeling it?
Doesn't it sound nice?

01:15:37.666 --> 01:15:40.250
I like it.
So, Napoleon, should we book it?

01:15:40.333 --> 01:15:41.708
-Hey!
-Hey.

01:15:41.791 --> 01:15:43.375
Did you see the chef?

01:15:43.458 --> 01:15:47.916
They've bought our building. They want
to turn it into a deluxe five-star hotel.

01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.083
Let me see.

01:15:49.166 --> 01:15:50.541
It seems the De Leonardis

01:15:50.625 --> 01:15:54.541
have had this hotel transformation
in the works for two years.

01:15:54.625 --> 01:15:58.458
They're gonna demolish the building.
We're all pissed. We should make a fuss.

01:16:17.291 --> 01:16:19.041
I told you to leave me alone.

01:16:19.625 --> 01:16:20.791
Brava!

01:16:20.875 --> 01:16:22.541
I wanted to congratulate you.

01:16:24.875 --> 01:16:27.000
You decided you wanted our building

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:29.000
and did all you could to drive us out.

01:16:29.500 --> 01:16:30.750
The rat infestation.

01:16:31.291 --> 01:16:32.375
The drains.

01:16:32.458 --> 01:16:35.125
And finally, the masterstroke.
The risk of collapse.

01:16:35.208 --> 01:16:36.208
Very good.

01:16:36.791 --> 01:16:38.875
In two years,
you managed to get everyone out.

01:16:39.583 --> 01:16:41.208
Except for me and my brother.

01:16:41.708 --> 01:16:43.291
What did you come up with then?

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:45.416
Scamming Antonello.

01:16:46.208 --> 01:16:48.458
It takes talent to scam people like that.

01:16:48.541 --> 01:16:50.333
And we aren't as good as you.

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:54.708
Great work, architect.

01:17:11.875 --> 01:17:12.958
Coming with me?

01:17:13.708 --> 01:17:15.083
No, I'm not quite done.

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:17.500
I'll call you later.

01:17:30.125 --> 01:17:32.000
Permits, documents,

01:17:32.083 --> 01:17:33.416
building…

01:17:36.041 --> 01:17:37.791
What does "cleared" mean?

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:42.166
"Request for demolition,
safety inspection, Naples City Hall."

01:17:42.250 --> 01:17:45.041
"Manager, Carmine Formisano."

01:17:45.125 --> 01:17:47.375
CARMINE FORMISANO
NAPLES CITY HALL

01:17:47.458 --> 01:17:49.708
What the fuck did you do, Federico?

01:18:22.041 --> 01:18:25.208
I didn't steal anything from anyone.
They sold, and I bought.

01:18:25.291 --> 01:18:26.958
The lucky ones at half the value.

01:18:27.041 --> 01:18:30.625
Marina, I did it for us.
For the company. For the hotel.

01:18:30.708 --> 01:18:33.958
No. You did it to pocket three million
and look good in front of my dad.

01:18:34.041 --> 01:18:35.416
-Cut it out.
-What's going on?

01:18:37.916 --> 01:18:40.666
Did you know the hotel building
isn't at risk of collapse?

01:18:40.750 --> 01:18:41.625
What's all this?

01:18:41.708 --> 01:18:46.500
-Calling it a "shit heap" would be kind.
-That's not true. You caused those issues.

01:18:47.333 --> 01:18:49.541
Vittorio, please. I'm sure you understand.

01:18:49.625 --> 01:18:52.583
This is the biggest deal
De Leonardi has ever done.

01:18:52.666 --> 01:18:55.458
Tomorrow, someone I trust
will give us the demolition permit.

01:18:55.541 --> 01:18:57.375
We'll demolish it and build our future.

01:18:57.458 --> 01:19:00.458
No point throwing away years of work.
We all stand to gain.

01:19:00.541 --> 01:19:01.375
No.

01:19:01.458 --> 01:19:04.750
We're stopping this right now,
and you're gonna fix everything.

01:19:06.291 --> 01:19:08.875
Hi, Giorgio.
Stay on the line for a second.

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:13.041
If this gets out, I won't go down alone.

01:19:13.125 --> 01:19:14.666
The signatures aren't mine.

01:19:16.541 --> 01:19:17.875
Dearest Giorgio!

01:19:17.958 --> 01:19:19.666
Yes, of course. We're all set.

01:19:22.750 --> 01:19:24.166
What does she want now?

01:19:27.333 --> 01:19:28.333
Yes, I know.

01:19:28.416 --> 01:19:31.125
We might hate each other,
but we have to work together.

01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:32.583
Says who? You?

01:19:33.791 --> 01:19:35.625
Do you want to save your building?

01:19:36.333 --> 01:19:37.166
Yes.

01:19:39.666 --> 01:19:42.500
-Hello.
-Wasn't he the guy who hates the poor?

01:19:42.583 --> 01:19:44.583
I don't hate the poor. They made me--

01:19:44.666 --> 01:19:46.666
Salvatore, shut up. The baby's sleeping.

01:19:47.875 --> 01:19:48.750
Let's get started.

01:19:50.791 --> 01:19:52.625
After the drain and cockroach issues,

01:19:52.708 --> 01:19:57.291
Federico bribed a city official,
who falsely declared the risk of collapse.

01:19:57.375 --> 01:19:58.708
I remember that prick.

01:19:58.791 --> 01:20:01.958
He even pretended
to take measurements with that thing--

01:20:02.041 --> 01:20:03.041
Good. Sit down.

01:20:04.750 --> 01:20:07.333
So what happened?
Everyone decided to leave.

01:20:07.416 --> 01:20:10.291
Except for you guys.
And so what did Federico do?

01:20:10.958 --> 01:20:12.625
Go after the link that was…

01:20:14.541 --> 01:20:17.708
-The weakest. I get it.
-The demolition is scheduled for tomorrow.

01:20:17.791 --> 01:20:19.916
Federico wants to cover it up
by building the hotel.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:22.833
This is a high-level plan, though.

01:20:22.916 --> 01:20:24.708
I mean, I was just wondering.

01:20:24.791 --> 01:20:28.333
Do you happen to know
if Federico offers training courses?

01:20:28.416 --> 01:20:30.708
No, all jokes aside, this guy's good.

01:20:30.791 --> 01:20:33.833
I don't know if you realized,
but she didn't notice a thing.

01:20:33.916 --> 01:20:35.041
It's not her fault.

01:20:35.125 --> 01:20:37.458
The poor thing was blinded by love.

01:20:37.541 --> 01:20:40.416
Does it bother you that
you're not the only one who played me?

01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:41.375
All right.

01:20:41.458 --> 01:20:44.708
I'd just like to remind you
that we're in deep shit here.

01:20:44.791 --> 01:20:46.541
We need to stick together.

01:20:46.625 --> 01:20:47.833
-Tell her that.
-Tell him.

01:20:47.916 --> 01:20:50.833
What is your brilliant idea, then?

01:20:50.916 --> 01:20:53.708
I took inspiration from you
and checked Federico's schedule.

01:20:53.791 --> 01:20:56.416
He rescheduled a meeting with the mayor
tomorrow at 11:00.

01:20:56.500 --> 01:20:59.125
He'd only do that
if he had a more important meeting.

01:20:59.208 --> 01:21:00.541
We're going to follow him.

01:21:02.166 --> 01:21:04.750
Don't get too close. He'll recognize you.

01:21:04.833 --> 01:21:07.041
Recognize me? You're wearing that dress!

01:21:07.125 --> 01:21:08.583
What's wrong with this dress?

01:21:08.666 --> 01:21:10.958
It's red. Very inconspicuous!

01:21:11.041 --> 01:21:12.000
-Meaning?
-Hold on!

01:21:20.833 --> 01:21:23.000
You could've told me
about all this before.

01:21:23.083 --> 01:21:26.541
Maybe we could've fixed it sooner.
But you pretended to be someone else.

01:21:26.625 --> 01:21:29.625
At least I knew
I was pretending to be someone else.

01:21:32.666 --> 01:21:33.833
Move away!

01:21:36.125 --> 01:21:38.125
Ma'am, please. You have to move.

01:21:58.375 --> 01:21:59.500
What is he doing?

01:22:00.208 --> 01:22:01.416
I've got no idea.

01:22:04.250 --> 01:22:05.750
Fuck! There he is! Come here.

01:22:13.625 --> 01:22:15.333
You know, I was thinking.

01:22:15.833 --> 01:22:19.000
I think it'd be perfect
if we managed to take a video.

01:22:19.791 --> 01:22:21.250
-But…
-A video?

01:22:21.333 --> 01:22:23.958
From above,
because we can't see shit from here.

01:22:25.791 --> 01:22:26.625
Understand?

01:22:27.125 --> 01:22:28.041
Good idea!

01:22:29.500 --> 01:22:32.125
-See? All the crap you say.
-Marí! Wait!

01:22:32.208 --> 01:22:35.416
-Sometimes you get a good idea.
-Slowly. What crap? Take it easy!

01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:38.041
-Climb up there!
-I have to climb?

01:22:38.125 --> 01:22:40.708
Get a move on!
They're not gonna wait for us.

01:22:43.291 --> 01:22:45.166
Wait a second.

01:22:47.041 --> 01:22:48.166
Damn it.

01:22:51.875 --> 01:22:52.875
I'm nearly there.

01:22:52.958 --> 01:22:55.500
-Mind you don't fall!
-"Mind you don't fall" now!

01:22:57.458 --> 01:22:59.583
-You can see everything here.
-Take the video!

01:22:59.666 --> 01:23:00.666
-What?
-Take the video!

01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:02.333
I am. I'm getting my phone out.

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:04.333
Hi!

01:23:04.833 --> 01:23:08.083
Hey, kid. What are you doing there?
I'm taking a video.

01:23:08.166 --> 01:23:09.250
Yeah, all right.

01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:11.916
Almost there.

01:23:12.416 --> 01:23:13.583
What the fuck--

01:23:14.208 --> 01:23:15.041
Kid!

01:23:15.708 --> 01:23:17.291
What are you doing? Shooting?

01:23:17.375 --> 01:23:19.000
Where's your mom? Did you eat her?

01:23:19.083 --> 01:23:20.416
Hang on! I'll be right back.

01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:22.583
-I'm gonna reload.
-Go on, don't forget!

01:23:24.208 --> 01:23:25.041
Hold on.

01:23:25.875 --> 01:23:26.875
There we go.

01:23:27.375 --> 01:23:29.750
-Marina, I got it!
-We need to tell my father!

01:23:29.833 --> 01:23:32.041
-They've exchanged documents, money.
-Record it!

01:23:32.125 --> 01:23:33.041
Hey! Thief!

01:23:33.125 --> 01:23:35.041
Oh God! An old lady in a floral dress!

01:23:35.125 --> 01:23:36.333
-Ma'am!
-My God, a thief!

01:23:36.416 --> 01:23:38.333
-Now there's an old woman.
-Ma'am--

01:23:38.416 --> 01:23:41.083
-Get down, you hear me?
-I'm not a thief!

01:23:41.166 --> 01:23:42.791
-Ma'am!
-Get out of here!

01:23:42.875 --> 01:23:44.375
Be careful! He'll fall…

01:23:45.666 --> 01:23:47.875
-Oh God!
-Jesus! What have I done?

01:23:47.958 --> 01:23:49.375
What's wrong? What happened?

01:23:49.458 --> 01:23:50.333
Nothing.

01:23:50.416 --> 01:23:53.333
There was a thief.
But I already killed him.

01:23:56.666 --> 01:23:58.750
-You wish, ma'am.
-Is your phone broken?

01:23:58.833 --> 01:24:00.458
No, it's here.

01:24:00.541 --> 01:24:02.458
Oh God, it hurts. Everything hurts.

01:24:02.541 --> 01:24:04.458
I told you to be careful.

01:24:05.458 --> 01:24:08.041
My thighs, my stomach, my kidneys! Jesus!

01:24:08.125 --> 01:24:09.625
But don't worry, okay?

01:24:09.708 --> 01:24:11.000
Hold on a second.

01:24:11.083 --> 01:24:15.500
Do you know why I didn't break anything?
Because I'm wearing my helmet. See?

01:24:16.916 --> 01:24:18.750
What the fuck are you doing here?

01:24:18.833 --> 01:24:21.375
-I should be asking you that.
-Are you following me?

01:24:21.458 --> 01:24:23.375
I wanted to see how you work, since

01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.416
you did such a good job scamming everyone.

01:24:27.708 --> 01:24:29.958
I thought we were on the same page.

01:24:32.291 --> 01:24:34.666
About what exactly, Federico?

01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:38.291
Because it's not like you ever
asked my opinion on the important stuff.

01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:40.500
Or am I wrong?

01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:45.750
Marina!

01:24:46.750 --> 01:24:49.875
You've never even been good
at deciding what's best for yourself,

01:24:50.666 --> 01:24:52.083
let alone anything else.

01:24:58.208 --> 01:24:59.083
That's true.

01:25:00.916 --> 01:25:03.125
But now that I've started,
I already feel much better.

01:25:04.916 --> 01:25:07.750
Take care, Federico. See you in court.

01:25:31.958 --> 01:25:34.000
Stop! Stop it!

01:25:34.083 --> 01:25:35.125
Stop!

01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:57.583
Hey, Vito.

01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:01.083
-You've become the perfect father.
-If you say so.

01:26:01.166 --> 01:26:02.666
But "Uncle" is plenty.

01:26:02.750 --> 01:26:04.000
These are yours.

01:26:04.791 --> 01:26:05.625
Mine are blue.

01:26:06.375 --> 01:26:07.208
Oh my God!

01:26:08.083 --> 01:26:11.333
-You take them. It'll be quicker.
-Mine are the ones with the pacifier!

01:26:13.916 --> 01:26:14.875
Marí.

01:26:17.041 --> 01:26:18.125
We did it.

01:26:20.708 --> 01:26:23.583
Do you really think
that makes everything okay between us?

01:26:33.916 --> 01:26:35.750
You saved the company from disaster.

01:26:36.833 --> 01:26:39.250
I just did what I thought was right.

01:26:41.541 --> 01:26:43.083
And I want to keep doing it.

01:26:45.375 --> 01:26:46.583
De Leonardi is you.

01:26:47.375 --> 01:26:48.500
It's not me.

01:26:48.583 --> 01:26:51.416
Miss, I still need to compliment you
on your mille-feuille.

01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:53.416
I dream about it.

01:26:54.375 --> 01:26:56.208
Are you the chef's father?

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:57.833
Yes…

01:26:57.916 --> 01:27:01.083
I'll explain later, Dad.
But yes, this is my father.

01:27:01.166 --> 01:27:03.375
-My compliments to you too.
-Thanks.

01:27:05.833 --> 01:27:07.083
-Vito.
-Hey.

01:27:07.166 --> 01:27:09.166
Take Napoleon. He wants his daddy.

01:27:09.666 --> 01:27:10.750
Come on, sweetie.

01:27:10.833 --> 01:27:12.083
There we go!

01:27:12.166 --> 01:27:14.083
Come to Daddy, son.

01:27:15.208 --> 01:27:18.041
Let's give your uncle a hug
for being so good, yeah?

01:27:18.125 --> 01:27:19.041
Come here.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.583
You remember Mom's recipe book?

01:27:24.666 --> 01:27:25.500
Yeah, so?

01:27:25.583 --> 01:27:27.250
Sorry to interrupt.

01:27:28.416 --> 01:27:30.041
I just wanted to thank you.

01:27:31.416 --> 01:27:32.958
Thank you, Mr. De Leonardi.

01:27:35.291 --> 01:27:36.291
Thank you, Marí.

01:27:45.083 --> 01:27:46.416
All right, let's go.

01:27:48.708 --> 01:27:49.583
Come on.

01:28:11.125 --> 01:28:13.458
Well? We did it.

01:28:15.375 --> 01:28:17.291
To think we went to all that trouble

01:28:17.875 --> 01:28:19.000
for this shit heap.

01:28:19.083 --> 01:28:20.416
But I have missed it.

01:28:20.916 --> 01:28:21.916
I missed it.

01:28:24.416 --> 01:28:26.541
He's not even listening to me.

01:28:31.083 --> 01:28:33.916
I can't find my phone.
Can you call it, please?

01:28:34.583 --> 01:28:35.583
Certainly!

01:28:48.458 --> 01:28:53.708
Vito, pick up! It's your brother.
The handsome one.

01:29:21.541 --> 01:29:23.791
ANTO: MARINA, LISTEN TO THIS

01:29:25.875 --> 01:29:27.333
You want the truth, Antoné?

01:29:30.791 --> 01:29:32.916
We thought we knew
everything about Marina.

01:29:35.125 --> 01:29:36.750
But we were completely clueless.

01:29:38.041 --> 01:29:39.500
I can't take that money.

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.125
But all this fuss was still worth it.

01:29:46.208 --> 01:29:47.083
I like Marina.

01:29:48.083 --> 01:29:49.458
I like her, Antoné.

01:29:50.041 --> 01:29:52.458
I like a rich, stylish woman

01:29:52.541 --> 01:29:54.958
who speaks five different languages,
except mine.

01:29:55.833 --> 01:29:57.250
Maybe that's why I like her.

01:29:58.833 --> 01:30:01.125
Because,
despite the perfectly ironed shirts

01:30:01.208 --> 01:30:03.666
and the fancy restaurants,
she's as messed up as I am.

01:30:04.833 --> 01:30:07.083
But even though she's messed up,
she fights.

01:30:08.250 --> 01:30:10.666
She fights with a strength
that wakes me up.

01:30:11.666 --> 01:30:13.250
That makes me ask myself,

01:30:13.916 --> 01:30:16.541
"What am I waiting for
to bring out my own strength?"

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.291
Marina brought me out of my shell.

01:30:20.416 --> 01:30:22.625
Me, who was convinced
that nothing could do that.

01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:25.166
But she managed it.

01:30:32.125 --> 01:30:34.958
-How long until the sauce is ready?
-Ten minutes.

01:30:40.666 --> 01:30:42.833
I came to give you your phone back.

01:30:43.708 --> 01:30:45.208
I'm not a thief like you.

01:30:47.666 --> 01:30:50.333
Thank you.
She came to give me my phone back.

01:30:52.166 --> 01:30:53.750
Is that the only reason you came?

01:30:54.541 --> 01:30:55.375
No.

01:30:56.583 --> 01:30:58.625
And to tell you
that you've got shit taste.

01:30:59.125 --> 01:31:02.625
You don't like Mengoni.
You dress like you're 15.

01:31:03.125 --> 01:31:04.791
And sorry,

01:31:04.875 --> 01:31:08.208
but what's with
that drug dealer earring you wear?

01:31:08.291 --> 01:31:10.375
Not to mention the crappy tattoos

01:31:10.458 --> 01:31:13.625
that even tattoo artists
refused to do since the '90s.

01:31:13.708 --> 01:31:16.958
Oh, and you like those movies
where everyone's shooting

01:31:17.041 --> 01:31:18.500
and nothing makes sense.

01:31:18.583 --> 01:31:20.083
Let me get this straight.

01:31:20.916 --> 01:31:23.041
Did you come here
to tell me I disgust you?

01:31:23.916 --> 01:31:24.750
Yes.

01:31:27.458 --> 01:31:28.541
You don't disgust me.

01:31:59.583 --> 01:32:01.333
She didn't come about the phone.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.166
Vito, are there any stuffed peppers left?

01:32:16.250 --> 01:32:17.500
There are two left!

01:32:17.583 --> 01:32:18.958
I'll take them!

01:32:19.041 --> 01:32:21.083
We called dibs!

01:32:21.166 --> 01:32:22.916
What? I called dibs first!

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:24.208
Hey, calm down!

01:32:24.291 --> 01:32:27.083
Send out a plate of broccoli rabe
to calm things down!

01:32:27.166 --> 01:32:30.541
These two are about to go at it!
All right, get a move on!

01:32:30.625 --> 01:32:32.250
Here's the pasta. Here you go.

01:32:33.791 --> 01:32:34.625
How are we doing?

01:32:34.708 --> 01:32:37.250
Well, we're basically out of everything.

01:32:37.333 --> 01:32:40.583
We've got some eggplant parmigiana
and one braided mozzarella.

01:32:40.666 --> 01:32:42.916
I told you to buy more stuff.

01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:46.125
Calm down,
or I'll go back to working with my dad.

01:32:46.208 --> 01:32:49.083
Honey, you know us poor folk eat a lot.

01:32:49.166 --> 01:32:51.458
Man, that guy is such a cheapskate!

01:32:51.541 --> 01:32:55.666
He didn't even leave me a tip,
and he asked me for a copy of the bill!

01:32:55.750 --> 01:32:56.708
Did you give him one?

01:32:56.791 --> 01:32:59.041
What am I, an accountant?
I don't deal with bills.

01:33:00.250 --> 01:33:03.416
-I think we should get things in order.
-That's not a bad idea.

01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:05.666
No, stop that. Get things in order?

01:33:05.750 --> 01:33:08.583
The only order here is chaos.
Deconstructed restaurant.

01:33:08.666 --> 01:33:09.958
That's it. End of story.

01:33:10.458 --> 01:33:12.666
-I'll fire him, I swear.
-I agree, I swear.

01:33:12.750 --> 01:33:14.875
Fire who? I'm an entrepreneur now.

01:33:14.958 --> 01:33:17.208
-He's an entrepreneur.
-Fire me! Who's there?

01:33:18.833 --> 01:33:21.166
Hello. A certified letter
for Antonello Esposito.

01:33:21.250 --> 01:33:22.125
Who is it?

01:33:22.208 --> 01:33:23.250
Just the mailman!

01:33:23.333 --> 01:33:26.291
Then say, "The mailman."
Jesus, he's so annoying.

01:33:27.041 --> 01:33:27.958
What is it?

01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:31.416
-Just a fine. I'll pay it later.
-"A fine"?

01:33:32.666 --> 01:33:35.208
-Show me.
-I said it's a fine. I'll explain later.

01:33:35.291 --> 01:33:39.041
-Show me what it says.
-I'll tell you later. It's my business!

01:33:39.125 --> 01:33:40.208
Show me!

01:33:40.291 --> 01:33:41.208
Look!

01:33:41.875 --> 01:33:43.708
The judge granted sole custody.

01:33:45.916 --> 01:33:46.750
Oh my God!

01:33:48.458 --> 01:33:49.541
Look.

01:33:49.625 --> 01:33:52.000
-What are you saying?
-That's what it says.

01:33:56.416 --> 01:33:58.250
This is the best news I've ever had.

01:34:01.541 --> 01:34:04.000
Napoleon. We did it, sweetheart!

01:34:10.333 --> 01:34:12.500
Are you happy? It's all over!

01:34:13.625 --> 01:34:14.583
What's this?

01:34:14.666 --> 01:34:15.541
No, nothing.

01:34:16.083 --> 01:34:16.916
What is it?

01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.625
I don't know, but I'm sure that…

01:34:19.708 --> 01:34:22.041
It's not what it looks like.
I can explain.

01:34:22.125 --> 01:34:23.916
You can explain, can you? Let's see.

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:29.666
"Dear Dr. Antonello Esposito…"
Are you a doctor now?

01:34:30.166 --> 01:34:31.666
Not that I know of.

01:34:31.750 --> 01:34:35.000
"We look forward to seeing you
in Tokyo on October 25th

01:34:35.083 --> 01:34:37.416
for the appointment
of the board of directors…"

01:34:38.375 --> 01:34:39.375
-I'll kill you.
-Wait.

01:34:39.458 --> 01:34:40.833
Let's look at this positively.

01:34:40.916 --> 01:34:43.375
-Oh, I'm positive.
-She's right. Stay positive.

01:34:43.458 --> 01:34:45.291
-I've had enough of you!
-That hurts!

01:34:45.375 --> 01:34:47.333
I want to know what this is about.

01:34:47.416 --> 01:34:49.750
-What is this Tokyo thing?
-I'm holding plates!

01:34:49.833 --> 01:34:52.083
-You'd better run!
-Look. Listen, Vito.

01:34:52.166 --> 01:34:55.000
Napoleon and I would like to go to Tokyo.

01:34:55.083 --> 01:34:57.625
You would?
Look what Daddy's doing to Uncle.

01:34:57.708 --> 01:34:59.666
-See? It wasn't me!
-You better explain!

01:34:59.750 --> 01:35:02.500
They're sending me letters.
No way is it my fault!

01:35:02.583 --> 01:35:05.583
Antonello, what is all this about?

01:35:05.666 --> 01:35:06.583
No!

01:35:11.708 --> 01:35:18.541
THE LOVE SCAM

01:39:39.166 --> 01:39:44.166
