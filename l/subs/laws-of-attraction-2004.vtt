WEBVTT

02:44.932 --> 02:47.635
Woman #1:
I MEAN THAT IF
YOU MADE MORE EFFORT,

02:47.635 --> 02:49.337
YOU MAY GET A MAN
TO ASK YOU OUT.

02:49.337 --> 02:51.205
Woman #2:
I DON'T WANT A MAN
TO ASK ME OUT.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.906
Woman #1:
YOU KNOW, 80% OF WOMEN

02:52.906 --> 02:55.142
WHO SAY THEY ARE TOO BUSY
TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP,

02:55.142 --> 02:56.610
ARE REALLY LONELY,
AUDREY.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.111
YOU KNOW, I DON'T
FEEL THE NEED TO DATE

02:58.111 --> 02:59.980
JUST TO STAY
ON THE RIGHT SIDE
OF A SURVEY.

02:59.980 --> 03:01.949
- AND IT'S BAD FOR YOUR SKIN.
- Audrey: WHAT?

03:01.949 --> 03:03.717
MY SKIN IS ALWAYS BETTER
WHEN I'M DATING.

03:03.717 --> 03:05.353
YOU'RE
NEVER NOT DATING.

03:05.353 --> 03:07.054
AND JUST LOOK
AT MY COMPLEXION.

03:07.054 --> 03:09.257
- YOU, ON THE OTHER HAND--
- Audrey: I, ON THE OTHER HAND,

03:09.257 --> 03:11.525
HAVE STOPPED HAVING
THIS CONVERSATION.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.126
OH MY GOD,
IS THIS IT?

03:13.126 --> 03:14.628
Man:
IT'S AN EXTRAORDINARY
TOWNHOUSE

03:14.628 --> 03:18.332
WITH A TOTAL FLOOR SPACE
OF 9,000 SQUARE FEET,

03:18.332 --> 03:20.234
NOT INCLUDING
THE GARDEN.

03:20.234 --> 03:21.735
MAY I ASK WHAT YOU DO?

03:21.735 --> 03:23.904
IT DEPENDS
ON THE OCCASION.

03:23.904 --> 03:26.274
AND YOUR FRIEND?

03:26.274 --> 03:28.509
I'M JUST ALONG
FOR THE RIDE.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.244
THIS VIEW
OF THE DINING ROOM

03:30.244 --> 03:34.014
WAS RECENTLY FEATURED
IN MANHATTAN INTERIORS
MAGAZINE.

03:34.014 --> 03:37.385
OH. WHAT WAS
HANGING THERE?

03:37.385 --> 03:39.052
Man:
UH, JOHN SARGENT.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.922
YEAH, MR. HARRISON HAS
AN AMAZING ART COLLECTION.

03:41.922 --> 03:44.057
TOO BAD NONE OF IT
COMES WITH THE TOWNHOUSE.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.126
NOW IF YOU'LL
FOLLOW ME THIS WAY.

03:46.126 --> 03:48.562
NOW THIS CEILING
WAS ACTUALLY HANDCRAFTED

03:48.562 --> 03:51.064
BY THE GREAT-GRANDSON
OF CHARLES THORPE.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.700
THAT WASN'T CHEAP.

03:52.700 --> 03:55.068
I GUESS IT PAYS
TO BE THE EMPEROR
OF INFOMERCIALS.

03:55.068 --> 03:58.372
MR. HARRISON MADE $30 MILLION
OFF 'THE HAIR HOUDINI' ALONE.

03:58.372 --> 03:59.907
THAT MUCH?
OH MY GOD.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.310
Man:
NOW IF YOU'LL FOLLOW ME
TO THE MAIN BEDROOM.

04:02.310 --> 04:05.279
KNOW WHAT, SARA?
I DON'T THINK THIS
IS THE PLACE FOR YOU.

04:05.279 --> 04:06.947
IT'S KIND OF...

04:06.947 --> 04:08.316
CRAMPED.

04:08.316 --> 04:11.285
- CRAMPED?
- WELL, IT WAS ALL
I COULD THINK OF.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.421
BESIDES, I HAD
EVERYTHING I NEEDED.

04:13.421 --> 04:16.790
SO, THE SARGENTS
IN THE DINING ROOM
ARE GONE,

04:16.790 --> 04:18.257
THE CASSATT
IN THE LIVING ROOM

04:18.257 --> 04:19.627
HAS BEEN REPLACED
BY A LITHOGRAPH,

04:19.627 --> 04:22.129
NUMBER 139
OF 150 RUN.

04:22.129 --> 04:25.232
OVER THE GRAND PIANO
IS A FRAMED POSTER OF
THE EAST HAMPTON FILM FESTIVAL.

04:25.232 --> 04:28.235
SOMEWHAT LESS VALUABLE
THAN THE SISLEY THAT
WAS HANGING THERE,

04:28.235 --> 04:30.871
AND WHATEVER THOSE
MONSTROSITIES ARE
IN THE HALLWAY--

04:30.871 --> 04:33.307
IF THEY'RE FRANCIS BACON,
I'M A JIMMY DEAN SAUSAGE.

04:33.307 --> 04:35.042
- ( chuckles )
- YES, SIR...

04:35.042 --> 04:37.611
MR. HARRISON'S SCAM
IS GOING TO UNRAVEL

04:37.611 --> 04:39.347
AND I WILL GET
MILLIONS OFF HIM.

04:39.347 --> 04:42.583
BUT FOR SOMEONE ELSE.
SEE, THAT'S THE PART
I DON'T GET.

04:42.583 --> 04:44.918
- WHERE'S THE PLEASURE?
- WINNING.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.723
- THANKS FOR TODAY, MOM.
- SHH-- AUDREY.

04:49.723 --> 04:52.693
( whispers )
I'VE ASKED YOU NOT TO USE
THAT WORD IN PUBLIC!

04:54.795 --> 04:57.731
THAT TWO-FACED,
LYING SON-OF-A-BASTARD!

04:57.731 --> 05:00.133
MARY, YOU KNOW
I DON'T LIKE SPOUSE BASHING.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.136
THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.
HE MAY HAVE HIDDEN THEM,
SOLD THEM--

05:03.136 --> 05:04.472
WE'LL FIND OUT.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.340
LUCKILY, I'VE DEALT
WITH TOM HOFFMAN,

05:06.340 --> 05:08.376
THE OPPOSING COUNSEL,
IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS.

05:08.376 --> 05:11.011
HE'S A GOOD LAWYER,
BUT I'M WISE TO HIS GAME.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.084
HMM.

05:17.084 --> 05:19.753
Mary:
WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?
IS IT BAD?

05:19.753 --> 05:21.755
Audrey:
NO, IT DOESN'T
MEAN ANYTHING.

05:21.755 --> 05:24.758
IT JUST MEANS THAT YOUR HUSBAND
HAS A HIRED A NEW ATTORNEY,
THAT'S ALL.

05:24.758 --> 05:26.760
HIS NAME IS
DANIEL RAFFERTY.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.562
- I'VE NEVER
HEARD OF HIM.
- ME NEITHER.

05:28.562 --> 05:29.763
Woman:
HE'S NEW IN TOWN.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.932
- THIS MAKES ME NERVOUS.
- OH, RELAX.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.934
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.036
A NEW ATTORNEY WHO HAS
NEVER PRACTICED IN NEW YORK

05:36.036 --> 05:39.440
WILL NEVER GET UP TO SPEED
THIS LATE IN THE GAME, OKAY?

05:39.440 --> 05:40.808
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

05:40.808 --> 05:43.711
I HAVE NEVER
LOST ONE OF THESE.

05:43.711 --> 05:46.414
( panting )
IT'S FINE, IT'S FINE.

05:46.414 --> 05:48.248
IT'S OKAY.
IT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

05:48.248 --> 05:50.518
IT'S OKAY, EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.720
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.991
( moans )

05:57.991 --> 06:00.728
( gags )

06:02.430 --> 06:05.699
MMM, MMM, MMM.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.135
OKAY.

06:09.136 --> 06:11.004
READY?

06:20.881 --> 06:23.083
Mary:
THAT'S GARY'S
NEW ATTORNEY?

06:42.402 --> 06:44.037
( sniffs )

06:46.907 --> 06:48.776
( groans )

06:49.577 --> 06:51.111
( clears throat )

06:51.111 --> 06:53.113
AUDREY WOODS.
I'M REPRESENTING
MRS. HARRISON.

06:53.113 --> 06:57.150
- AUDREY WOODS.
- RIGHT, FOR MRS. HARRISON.

06:57.150 --> 06:59.720
I'VE HEARD GOOD THINGS.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.655
THAT FELT NICE,
BY THE WAY.

07:01.655 --> 07:04.792
I REALIZE YOU'RE JUST STARTING
TO FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF
WITH THE CASE,

07:04.792 --> 07:06.727
BUT I WANTED
TO MAKE YOU AWARE
THAT-- WHAT?

07:06.727 --> 07:08.896
ER, YOU GOT A LITTLE--
RIGHT HERE.

07:09.863 --> 07:11.832
UH, THANK YOU.
ANYWAY, AS I WAS SAYING,

07:11.832 --> 07:14.568
UM, IT HAS COME
TO OUR ATTENTION
THAT CERTAIN ASSETS

07:14.568 --> 07:17.337
ACCUMULATED, UH--
ACCUMULATED DURING THE MARRIAGE

07:17.337 --> 07:19.306
HAVE NOT BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR,

07:19.306 --> 07:21.141
SO I HAVE COME TO WHAT
I BELIEVE

07:21.141 --> 07:24.444
- IS AN ACCURATE ESTIMATE
OF THE-- OF THE MISSING--
- SNOBALL.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.580
I DON'T SETTLE.

07:26.580 --> 07:28.816
I DIDN'T
MENTION SETTLING.

07:28.816 --> 07:31.051
UNLESS OF COURSE
YOU'D LIKE TO GIVE ME UH...

07:31.051 --> 07:33.053
LET ME SEE...

07:33.053 --> 07:35.055
( phone beeps )

07:36.323 --> 07:38.025
...THIS.

07:38.025 --> 07:40.127
WHICH IS WHAT I'LL EARN
FOR THIS TRIAL--
PLUS EXPENSES.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.496
- THEN WE'VE GOT
SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT.
- YOU MUST BE JOKING.

07:42.496 --> 07:45.098
GAVE IT A SHOT.
GOOD LUCK.

07:47.234 --> 07:50.103
MS. WOODS, IS IT?

07:52.540 --> 07:54.708
- HEY, DANIEL.
- GOOD MORNING.
GOOD MORNING.

07:54.708 --> 07:58.979
GOOD NEWS--
OPPOSING COUNSEL'S INSANE.

08:14.461 --> 08:19.967
- ( door opens )
- Bailiff: ALL RISE.
532 IS NOW IN SESSION.

08:23.170 --> 08:26.540
Bailiff:
PLEASE BE SEATED
AND COME TO ORDER.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.411
JUDGE ABRAMOVITZ
DIVORCED... HORRIBLY.

08:31.411 --> 08:33.013
VERY TOUGH ON MEN.

08:33.013 --> 08:35.148
Abramovitz:
GOOD MORNING,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

08:36.316 --> 08:37.585
MR. RAFFERTY,

08:37.585 --> 08:40.220
I SEE YOU'RE BACK
ON THE EAST COAST.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.690
I TOLD YOU THE CALIFORNIA SUN
IS HARD ON THE SKIN.

08:42.690 --> 08:47.027
YES, BUT, UH, I DID MOISTURIZE
AS PER YOUR INSTRUCTIONS,
YOUR HONOR.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.664
I'LL HEAR
OPENING ARGUMENTS.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.337
YOUR HONOR,
I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE
FOR A CONTINUANCE.

08:57.337 --> 08:59.573
IT'S COME TO OUR ATTENTION
THAT DISCREPANCIES EXIST

08:59.573 --> 09:03.243
CONCERNING THE REPORTING
OF ASSETS-- NAMELY, SEVERAL
VALUABLE WORKS OF ART.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.579
UH, MAY I INTERJECT,
YOUR HONOR?

09:05.579 --> 09:09.717
UH, YOU MEAN,
UM, PAINTINGS, SCULPTURE,
THAT KIND OF STUFF?

09:09.717 --> 09:11.785
EXACTLY.

09:14.254 --> 09:16.256
PAINTINGS LIKE THIS?

09:16.256 --> 09:18.258
ACTUALLY, YES.

09:18.258 --> 09:20.127
LIKE THIS, UH, SISLEY

09:20.127 --> 09:22.863
OR THIS MORISOT?

09:24.197 --> 09:28.168
AND WHAT HAVE WE HERE?
OH, JOHN SARGENT.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.003
YES, NOT MY
KIND OF THING.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.606
IF I WAS HIM, I WOULD HAVE
GIVEN THEM AWAY TOO.

09:32.606 --> 09:35.308
WHICH IS EXACTLY
WHAT MR. HARRISON DID.

09:35.308 --> 09:37.344
ALL OF THESE.
A WHILE AGO.

09:37.344 --> 09:40.447
ANONYMOUSLY, OF COURSE,
TO A VERY PROMINENT MUSEUM.

09:40.447 --> 09:44.151
I'M SURPRISED THAT
MRS. HARRISON DIDN'T
TELL YOU ABOUT THIS, MS. WOODS.

09:44.151 --> 09:47.287
SEE, HER, UH, SIGNATURE'S
ON THE DONATION DOCUMENT.

09:47.287 --> 09:48.889
RIGHT THERE.

09:48.889 --> 09:50.758
( clears throat )

09:51.792 --> 09:54.294
OH,UH,THAT REMINDS ME,
YOUR HONOR,

09:54.294 --> 09:56.930
UM,I'D LIKE TO MOVE
FOR A CONTINUANCE.

09:56.930 --> 09:59.132
I'VE JUST BEEN RETAINED
AS MR. HARRISON'S COUNSEL,

09:59.132 --> 10:01.034
AND I HAVEN'T HAD TIME
TO FULLY RESEARCH

10:01.034 --> 10:03.036
ALL ASPECTS
OF THE CASE.

10:03.036 --> 10:05.806
FOR INSTANCE,
I HAVE A UM...

10:05.806 --> 10:07.908
A RECEIPT HERE...

10:07.908 --> 10:12.045
FOR SIX 28-DAY STAYS
AT THE PINEY WOODS REHAB CENTER

10:12.045 --> 10:16.316
FOR MRS. HARRISON'S
TREATMENT OF SEXUAL ADDICTION.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.054
I'D LIKE TO GET
TO THE BOTTOM OF THAT.

10:23.123 --> 10:26.259
- I'LL GIVE YOU ONE WEEK.
- Rafferty: THANK YOU,
YOUR HONOR.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.165
SIX MONTHS
FOR SEXUAL ADDICTION?

10:32.165 --> 10:34.501
MY THERAPIST
WAS VERY GOOD.

10:34.501 --> 10:37.070
( whispers )
WE HAVE TO TALK.

10:37.070 --> 10:39.072
IT'S NOT MY FAULT
THAT MARY HARRISON

10:39.072 --> 10:41.041
HAS THE IQ
OF A DINNER PLATE.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.343
I'D HAVE FOUND OUT THAT
HARRISON DISPOSED OF THE ART.

10:43.343 --> 10:45.345
I MEAN, THAT'S WHY
I ASKED FOR THE CONTINUANCE.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.214
IT'S JUST THAT THIS
RAFFERTY GUY BEAT ME TO IT.

10:47.214 --> 10:48.648
Sara:
You want him dead?

10:48.648 --> 10:50.550
- OH, MOTHER.
- I MEANT SOCIALLY.

10:50.550 --> 10:53.086
Audrey:
I don't know, I've never been
up against anyone like him.

10:53.086 --> 10:56.089
HE'S VERY UN...
SOMETHING.

10:56.089 --> 10:58.959
I CAN'T TELL IF HE JUST
GOT LUCKY OR HE'S...

10:58.959 --> 11:00.894
REALLY, REALLY GOOD.

11:00.894 --> 11:03.430
- Sara: Maybe he's both.
- THANK YOU, MOTHER.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.165
WHAT ARE YOU EATING?

11:06.266 --> 11:08.368
( distorted )
VEGETABLES.

11:08.368 --> 11:11.304
- IS THIS RAFFERTY GUY CUTE?
- I didn't notice.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.640
BESIDES, HE'S NOT YOUR TYPE.
HE'S OLD ENOUGH TO DRIVE.

11:13.640 --> 11:15.776
QUICK,
CHANNEL 6.

11:18.145 --> 11:20.013
...in court today
were opening arguments

11:20.013 --> 11:22.082
in the divorce
of Gary "Gadget" Harrison.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.984
- CHANNEL 6, MOM.
- Harrison is being sued...

11:26.153 --> 11:28.956
...at stake--
a reported $97 million.

11:28.956 --> 11:32.025
We caught up
with Harrison's attorney
Daniel Rafferty

11:32.025 --> 11:34.261
earlier today
outside the courthouse.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.997
- Well, we do feel that
that Mrs. Harrison's
- ( gasps )

11:36.997 --> 11:38.431
monetary demands
are outrageous.

11:38.431 --> 11:40.533
After all,
it's Mr. Harrison's products

11:40.533 --> 11:43.871
that come with
a money-back guarantee,
not Mr. Harrison.

11:43.871 --> 11:47.340
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.
HE JUST GOT INTO TOWN AND HE'S
ALREADY WORKING THE PRESS.

11:47.340 --> 11:51.078
- AND YOU DIDN'T
NOTICE IF HE'S CUTE?
- SHH, CALL ME LATER.

11:51.078 --> 11:55.215
- Quite frankly, after
this morning's opening...
- SHE TAKES AFTER HER FATHER.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.517
The prenuptial
will stand as agreed.

11:57.517 --> 12:00.653
Mrs. Harrison's case
has about as much chance as a...

12:00.653 --> 12:03.123
uh, snowball in hell.

12:04.825 --> 12:07.895
OKAY, MR. RAFFERTY...

12:07.895 --> 12:09.830
I ACCEPT.

12:19.039 --> 12:22.042
Audrey:
WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED?

12:56.409 --> 12:58.278
HELLO?

12:58.278 --> 13:00.313
MR. RAFFERTY?

13:02.149 --> 13:04.317
HELLO?

13:23.971 --> 13:25.638
Rafferty:
THANKS, BENNY.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.808
ANYMORE ARRIVE, JUST PUT THEM
OUTSIDE MY DOOR, OKAY?

13:46.927 --> 13:49.262
( emergency exit alarm
blaring )

14:08.215 --> 14:11.084
- Audrey: OH-- OH, UH!
- Man: HEY.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.486
( man speaking Chinese )

14:13.486 --> 14:15.956
OH, SORRY.
PARDON ME.

14:18.225 --> 14:20.093
( tires screech,
horn honks )

14:20.093 --> 14:23.563
- WAIT, WAIT, I'M WALKING HERE!
- Driver: HEY, YOU LOOKING
TO DIE, LADY?

14:23.563 --> 14:27.500
AND VERY KINDLY STEPPING
IN AT THE LAST MINUTE
FOR ERIN SWEDLAND,

14:27.500 --> 14:30.503
ONE OF NEW YORK'S
MOST SUCCESSFUL ATTORNEYS;

14:30.503 --> 14:35.742
FIRST IN HER CLASS AT YALE,
AND PARTNER AT KATZ, COHEN
& PHELPS--

14:35.742 --> 14:37.877
AUDREY WOODS.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.883
( banging )

14:46.419 --> 14:47.720
SORRY.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.557
( door loudly closes )

14:50.557 --> 14:52.092
( whispers )
SORRY.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.593
( exhales )

14:54.962 --> 14:56.829
SMALL WORLD, EH?

14:56.829 --> 15:01.368
AND ANOTHER COUNSELOR
KIND ENOUGH TO STEP IN
AT THE LAST MINUTE.

15:01.368 --> 15:04.337
SOME SAY THERE'S
METHOD IN HIS MADNESS.

15:04.337 --> 15:07.674
- SOME SAY
MADNESS IS HIS METHOD.
- ( audience chuckles )

15:07.674 --> 15:10.810
HE'S PRACTICED IN CHICAGO,
BOSTON, LOS ANGELES.

15:10.810 --> 15:13.846
AND I GUESS PRACTICE
MAKES PERFECT...

15:13.846 --> 15:17.117
BECAUSE HE'S NEVER
LOST A CASE.

15:17.117 --> 15:20.087
THE "LATE"
DANIEL RAFFERTY.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.122
- ( applause )
- Rafferty: MMM.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.662
DO YOU ALWAYS LOOK
LIKE AN UNMADE BED?

15:29.662 --> 15:31.464
UH-OH.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.800
YOU'VE EITHER TAKEN
AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE TO ME

15:33.800 --> 15:37.204
FOR SOME INEXPLICABLE REASON,
OR YOU'RE FLIRTING WITH ME.

15:37.204 --> 15:38.871
- WHICH IS IT?
- I'LL GIVE YOU HINT.

15:38.871 --> 15:41.841
- YOU'RE GETTING WARM
WITH THE FIRST ONE.
- UH-HUH.

15:41.841 --> 15:44.978
- WHAT WAS
THE SECOND ONE AGAIN?
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:44.978 --> 15:48.548
- WELL, AT LEAST YOU COULD BE
A BIT MORE GRATEFUL.
- GRATEFUL FOR WHAT?

15:48.548 --> 15:51.551
WELL, MY OLD FRIEND
LYMAN OVER THERE NEEDED
A REPLACEMENT.

15:51.551 --> 15:54.187
HE ASKED ME IF I KNEW
AN INTERESTING LAWYER.

15:54.187 --> 15:57.657
I HAPPEN TO THINK
YOU'RE VERY INTERESTING.

15:57.657 --> 15:59.792
- YOU?
- MMM.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.395
- NOW PLEASE WELCOME
OUR FIRST PANELIST...
- I'M HERE BECAUSE OF YOU?

16:02.395 --> 16:04.464
-...AUDREY WOODS.
- ( crowd applauding )

16:04.464 --> 16:06.133
YOU'RE UP.

16:14.241 --> 16:16.176
SO MY ADVICE
TO YOU IS

16:16.176 --> 16:18.445
DIVORCE DOESN'T
HAVE TO BE AGONY.

16:18.445 --> 16:22.349
LOOK AT IT AS A CHANCE
TO EXAMINE THE COMPLEX
EMOTIONAL LABYRINTH

16:22.349 --> 16:26.519
THAT IS
THE HUMAN RELATIONSHIP.

16:36.463 --> 16:40.133
- WELL DONE, WELL DONE.
- Lyman: THANK YOU, MS. WOODS,
VERY ENLIGHTENING.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.935
- LIKE A NIBBLE?
- YOU RAISE SOME
INTERESTING POINTS.

16:42.935 --> 16:46.073
- NO?
- AND NOW, LET'S HEAR
FROM DANIEL RAFFERTY.

16:46.073 --> 16:48.541
MMM, THAT'S ME.
ANY SNO-BITS?

16:51.278 --> 16:52.645
( clears throat )

16:52.645 --> 16:54.147
HI.

16:55.448 --> 16:57.984
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
GOOD MORNING, LADIES
AND GENTLEMEN.

16:57.984 --> 17:00.487
AH, WONDERFUL SPEECH,
MS. WOODS.

17:00.487 --> 17:05.325
BUT, UH, THIS IS
THE WAY I SEE IT.

17:05.325 --> 17:07.493
LAWYERS ARE SCUM.

17:07.493 --> 17:09.896
DIVORCE LAWYERS THOUGH...

17:09.896 --> 17:13.700
- ARE THE FUNGUS
GROWING BENEATH THE SCUM.
- ( audience chuckles )

17:13.700 --> 17:16.836
DIVORCE IS THE POST MORTEM
OF A DEAD MARRIAGE.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.906
WE REPRESENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE
SUDDENLY DISCOVERED A PASSION

17:19.906 --> 17:23.175
FOR A FIGHT THAT THEY NEVER
KNEW THEY HAD IN THEM.

17:23.175 --> 17:26.512
WHERE WAS THAT
PASSION AND FIGHT

17:26.512 --> 17:29.982
WHEN IT WAS NEEDED
TO SAVE THE MARRIAGE?

17:29.982 --> 17:31.384
HMM?

17:31.384 --> 17:34.020
DON'T ASK.
IT'S NOT OUR JOBS.

17:34.020 --> 17:36.123
EVERYONE LOVES GADGETS.

17:36.123 --> 17:39.025
AND THE WAY DIVORCE IS GOING
THESE DAYS, YOU'RE GOING TO GET
A CHANCE TO USE THEM.

17:39.025 --> 17:40.760
STATE-OF-THE-ART STUFF

17:40.760 --> 17:44.997
FOR TRACKING
THE PHILANDERING HUSBAND
OR THE UNFAITHFUL WIFE.

17:44.997 --> 17:47.300
FOR INSTANCE,

17:47.300 --> 17:50.870
A CAMERA THIS SMALL

17:50.870 --> 17:53.773
CAN TAKE A PICTURE...

17:53.773 --> 17:56.042
THIS BIG.

17:56.042 --> 17:57.944
AMAZING, ISN'T IT?

17:57.944 --> 18:00.147
DON'T YOU THINK
THE CLARITY IS WONDERFUL?

18:00.147 --> 18:03.916
I'M SURE YOU PEOPLE AT THE BACK
CAN SEE ALL THE ROSES ON
OUR SUSPECT'S SCARF.

18:03.916 --> 18:08.588
NO LONGER DO WE HAVE TO RELY
ON CRUDE CONVENIENT STORE VIDEO.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.757
WITH DIGITAL CAPABILITY,

18:10.757 --> 18:13.826
WE CAN DISPOSE
OF 20 CLOSED-CIRCUIT SYSTEMS

18:13.826 --> 18:18.431
AND ACHIEVE OPTIMUM
PICTURE QUALITY.

18:18.431 --> 18:21.734
NOW I'M SURE THE PERSON...
THERE DIDN'T REALIZE

18:21.734 --> 18:24.204
THAT THEY WERE BEING
CAUGHT IN THE ACT.

18:24.204 --> 18:25.972
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

18:25.972 --> 18:28.107
REMEMBER, NONE OF US

18:28.107 --> 18:30.843
ARE IN DIVORCE LAW FOR LOVE.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.146
( applause )

18:38.351 --> 18:40.620
Sara:
I THINK YOU LIKE HIM.

18:40.620 --> 18:43.390
LIKE HIM?
ARE YOU CRAZY?

18:43.390 --> 18:45.057
SURE, BUT I'M ALSO
YOUR MOTHER...

18:45.057 --> 18:47.460
WHEN WE'RE
NOT IN PUBLIC.

18:47.460 --> 18:50.062
- ( gasps )
- I KNOW, IT'S
A LITTLE PAINFUL,

18:50.062 --> 18:52.465
BUT I CAN SEE
RESULTS ALREADY.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.034
I HAVE THE LOWER LIDS
OF A TEENAGER. OH!

18:55.034 --> 18:58.671
OKAY, ONE THAT'S BEEN THROWN
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD, BUT
A TEENAGER NEVERTHELESS.

18:58.671 --> 19:00.673
I DIDN'T SLEEP A WINK
BECAUSE OF THAT GUY.

19:00.673 --> 19:03.676
DON'T WORRY,
I'M GOING TO CATCH HIM
WITH HIS GUARD DOWN,

19:03.676 --> 19:05.812
AND THEN KICK HIM
IN THE BODY PART
OF MY CHOOSING.

19:05.812 --> 19:09.148
JUST BE CAREFUL,
YOU'VE NEVER LOST
A BIG CASE.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.218
WELL,
NEITHER HAS HE.

19:11.218 --> 19:12.752
AND THAT'S JUST
IRRESISTIBLE.

19:12.752 --> 19:15.121
- MOTHER!
- I'M SORRY.

19:15.121 --> 19:17.924
THAT'S IT.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.559
I'LL APOLOGIZE.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.395
TO RAFFERTY? WHY?
YOU HAVEN'T DONE
ANYTHING WRONG.

19:22.395 --> 19:25.131
EXACTLY. SO IT'LL BE
THE LAST THING HE'S EXPECTING.

19:25.131 --> 19:27.099
IT'S THE PERFECT STRATEGY.

19:27.099 --> 19:29.602
A SINCERE APOLOGY
IS JUST A MANIPULATING TACTIC,

19:29.602 --> 19:32.605
LIKE-- LIKE FORGIVENESS,
OR GENEROSITY.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.774
HE'LL FALL FOR IT.
HE'S NOT FROM NEW YORK.

19:34.774 --> 19:38.378
YOU ARE SO ADORABLE
WHEN YOU'RE GOING
FOR THE KILL.

19:39.178 --> 19:40.847
HI.

19:40.847 --> 19:42.515
I CAME TO APOLOGIZE.

19:42.515 --> 19:45.252
OH... YOU'RE
BOTHERING TO KNOCK.

19:45.252 --> 19:47.053
DON'T YOU USUALLY JUST
BREAK AND ENTER?

19:47.053 --> 19:50.290
HYSTERICAL.
AND I DIDN'T
BREAK AND ENTER.

19:50.290 --> 19:51.824
IF YOU REVIEW
YOUR SURVEILLANCE TAPE--

19:51.824 --> 19:53.860
YOU KNOW,
JUST HOW PARANOID
ARE YOU BY THE WAY?

19:53.860 --> 19:55.595
YOU'LL NOTICE
THAT YOUR OFFICE WAS OPEN

19:55.595 --> 19:57.630
AND MY INTENTION
WAS TO HAVE A MEETING.

19:57.630 --> 20:01.133
MY APOLOGY
IS FOR ANY CONFUSION.

20:01.133 --> 20:02.835
OH.

20:04.003 --> 20:06.038
( sniffs )
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.074
"COME IN"
WOULD BE NICE.

20:08.074 --> 20:10.343
COME IN.

20:11.344 --> 20:13.145
( chuckles )

20:13.145 --> 20:15.748
ACTUALLY, YOU'RE LUCKY
I DON'T SUE YOU FOR
INJURIES SUSTAINED

20:15.748 --> 20:17.917
WHEN I PICKED UP
THOSE FILE BOXES.

20:17.917 --> 20:20.987
I CITE "GIBBON V. MASTERS--
TREACHEROUS CONDITIONS
IN THE WORKPLACE."

20:20.987 --> 20:23.290
Rafferty:
YOU, UH, SUSTAINED AN INJURY?

20:23.290 --> 20:26.426
I BROKE A NAIL.
OPEN YOUR PRESENT.

20:29.662 --> 20:32.799
OH, LOOK AT THAT.
VERY NICE.

20:32.799 --> 20:35.468
I THOUGHT YOU'D ENJOY
OWNING ONE WITHOUT A STAIN.

20:35.468 --> 20:37.804
INTERESTING PRESUMPTION.

20:37.804 --> 20:40.072
YOU GAVE A VERY GOOD SPEECH
YESTERDAY, BY THE WAY.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.774
VERY PROVOCATIVE.

20:41.774 --> 20:45.244
THE, UH, "BUTTER WOULDN'T MELT"
GUIDE TO DIVORCE.

20:45.244 --> 20:47.547
I TAKE THE HIGH ROAD.
I USE THE LAW,

20:47.547 --> 20:49.248
NOT CHEAP THEATRICS.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.051
OKAY.

20:52.051 --> 20:53.986
MEETING'S A GOOD IDEA.

20:53.986 --> 20:57.089
SO LET'S GET ON WITH IT.

20:57.089 --> 21:00.026
( scoffs )
EXCUSE ME?

21:00.026 --> 21:02.895
LET'S MEET OVER DINNER.
AND SINCE YOU INITIATED IT,

21:02.895 --> 21:05.965
PROTOCOL DICTATES
THAT YOU SHOULD TAKE ME,
DON'T YOU THINK?

21:05.965 --> 21:07.867
YES, OF COURSE.

21:07.867 --> 21:10.870
OR... WE COULD EAT HERE.
I HAVE SNICKERS.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.173
HELLO, LESLIE,
WOULD YOU BOOK MY TABLE

21:14.173 --> 21:16.343
- AT THE FOUR SEASONS, PLEASE?
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

21:16.343 --> 21:19.078
MY CHOICE.
BYE, LESLIE.

21:19.078 --> 21:21.781
ALL RIGHT, AS LONG AS
IT ISN'T OUTSIDE.

21:21.781 --> 21:23.650
THERE'S A 65%
CHANCE OF RAIN TONIGHT.

21:23.650 --> 21:26.218
THERE'S A LOW-PRESSURE SYSTEM
COMING OUT OF THE NORTHWEST.

21:26.218 --> 21:28.388
I WATCH
THE WEATHER CHANNEL.

21:28.388 --> 21:31.758
COULD YOU BE
MORE FASCINATING?

21:31.758 --> 21:34.193
* DE COLOMBIA
O DE BRASIL *

21:34.193 --> 21:36.563
* ¿CUáL CAFé
SE VA A SERVIR? *

21:36.563 --> 21:39.832
* RICO FRíO
Y CULTO ES UD *

21:39.832 --> 21:42.535
* ¿QUé EXPRESITO
QUIERE BEBER? *

21:42.535 --> 21:44.737
AH, DOS HUEVOS DE CHIVO,
POR FAVOR.

21:44.737 --> 21:47.239
¿HUEVOS DE CHIVO?
WITH THE HUEVO?

21:47.239 --> 21:49.041
OH, Sí.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.678
- ( band finishes song )
- ( applause )

21:51.678 --> 21:53.346
GOD, I LOVE THIS PLACE.

21:53.346 --> 21:55.515
IT'S SO ROMANTIC, NO?

21:55.515 --> 21:57.517
- NO.
- OH.

21:57.517 --> 21:59.919
- SO WHAT WAS
ALL THIS HIGH-MORALITY,
- ( salsa music playing )

21:59.919 --> 22:02.188
PASSION-WITHIN-A-MARRIAGE
CRAP YOU WERE SPOUTING?

22:02.188 --> 22:04.524
WELL, DON'T YOU EVER
JUST WANT TO SLAP YOUR CLIENTS,

22:04.524 --> 22:06.125
TELL THEM TO GO HOME
AND SORT IT OUT?

22:06.125 --> 22:08.027
ACTUALLY, NO, I DON'T.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.729
EACH CASE I HANDLE
CONVINCES ME FURTHER

22:09.729 --> 22:11.864
THAT MARRIAGE
IS DEAD IN THE WATER.

22:11.864 --> 22:13.833
I SEE.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.001
- I SEE?
- YEP.

22:15.001 --> 22:17.970
- THAT'S IT? YOU SEE?
- YES, I DO.

22:17.970 --> 22:20.873
I SEE A LOT.
ARE YOU DATING ANYONE?

22:20.873 --> 22:23.109
YOU SEE A LOT--
AM I DATING ANYONE?

22:23.109 --> 22:25.812
- WHAT KIND
OF A SEGUE IS THAT?
- I DON'T THINK YOU ARE.

22:25.812 --> 22:28.047
OHH,
THIS IS WHAT YOU SEE.

22:28.047 --> 22:30.049
YOU SEE THAT I COULDN'T
BE DATING ANYONE?

22:30.049 --> 22:32.885
I COULD BE DATING, MISTER.
TRUST ME, OKAY?

22:32.885 --> 22:34.687
I COULD BE DATING
A WHOLE BIG DEAL.

22:34.687 --> 22:36.623
I COULD BE LOBBYING
FOR A 12-DAY WEEK,

22:36.623 --> 22:39.091
I'M DATING SO MUCH, OKAY?
OH, WHAT IS THIS?

22:39.091 --> 22:41.260
WHAT IS THIS,
"ARMS IN THE AIR,
I REST MY CASE" THING?

22:41.260 --> 22:43.830
- WHAT IS THAT?
- YOU'RE NOT DATING. WHY NOT?

22:43.830 --> 22:46.265
- OKAY, SINCE YOU ASK...
- YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL...

22:46.265 --> 22:48.134
- WHAT IS DATING ANYWAY?
- INTELLIGENT.

22:48.134 --> 22:50.236
- IT'S TRIAL MARRIAGE.
- I'M EATING WITH
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL--

22:50.236 --> 22:52.304
WHAT? TRIAL MARRIAGE?
I THOUGHT YOU JUST SAID
MARRIAGE WAS DEAD IN THE WATER.

22:52.304 --> 22:54.206
AND THAT'S
WHY I DON'T DATE.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.676
SUBJECT CLOSED.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.655
- HOW ABOUT YOU?
- HOW ABOUT ME, WHAT?

23:08.655 --> 23:11.524
- YOU DATING ANYONE?
- I THOUGHT YOU JUST
CLOSED THAT SUBJECT.

23:11.524 --> 23:13.893
- I JUST REOPENED IT.
- I SEE.

23:13.893 --> 23:16.629
YOU MEAN,
APART FROM TONIGHT?

23:16.629 --> 23:18.631
THIS ISN'T A DATE.

23:18.631 --> 23:20.933
- THIS IS A MEETING.
- SERIOUSLY?

23:20.933 --> 23:23.870
YES, SERIOUSLY.
MY FIRST RESPONSE
IS ALWAYS THE TRUTH.

23:23.870 --> 23:26.305
IT'S A RULE I LIVE BY,
PERSONALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY.

23:26.305 --> 23:28.541
A PERSON'S FIRST RESPONSE
IS WHAT THEY TRULY FEEL.

23:28.541 --> 23:31.243
OH, THAT'S VERY GOOD,
VERY PROFOUND. I MEAN,
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

23:31.243 --> 23:34.346
BUT CAN'T
WE REACH A COMPROMISE,
CALL IT AN INTIMATE MEETING?

23:34.346 --> 23:36.215
INTIMACY DOESN'T
CHANGE A THING.

23:36.215 --> 23:37.950
BUSINESS IS BUSINESS.

23:37.950 --> 23:40.987
OH, COME ON,
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.021
OH, BOY.

23:42.021 --> 23:43.923
DON'T YOU TRY
TO ANALYZE ME

23:43.923 --> 23:46.593
WITH YOUR DISHEVELED, BOHEMIAN,
"MY SOCKS DON'T MATCH,

23:46.593 --> 23:49.562
THEREFORE I HAVE
INSIGHT TO ALL THINGS"
WHACKO MINDSET.

23:49.562 --> 23:54.100
THERE ARE NO PSYCHOANALYTICAL
SHORTCUTS INTO MY PANTS, OKAY?

23:54.100 --> 23:55.902
DOS HUEVOS DE CHIVOS.

23:57.236 --> 23:58.571
GRACIAS.

23:58.571 --> 24:00.507
Rafferty: Mmm.

24:00.507 --> 24:03.743
OH, LOOK,
MEDICAL WASTE
IN A GLASS.

24:05.111 --> 24:07.146
- NO UMBRELLA?
- OKAY, YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO DRINK THIS.

24:07.146 --> 24:09.616
THIS IS AN OLD
CUBAN TRADITION I LEARNED.

24:09.616 --> 24:12.384
BEFORE THE DUEL,
THE TWO OPPONENTS DRINK

24:12.384 --> 24:13.820
THE HUEVO DE CHIVO
TOGETHER.

24:13.820 --> 24:17.657
IT MEANS "JUST BECAUSE
I'M TRYING TO KILL YOU,

24:17.657 --> 24:20.192
DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T
LOVE AND RESPECT YOU."

24:21.661 --> 24:23.596
HUEVO DE CHIVO.

24:27.934 --> 24:30.803
- ( loudly exhales )
- ( Audrey gags )

24:30.803 --> 24:33.072
- ( coughs )
- ( laughs )

24:34.106 --> 24:35.542
OHH! AHH!

24:35.542 --> 24:37.109
WHAT THE HELL
WAS THAT?

24:37.109 --> 24:39.879
HUEVO DE CHIVO.
GOAT'S NUT.

24:41.047 --> 24:42.348
GOAT'S NUT?

24:42.348 --> 24:44.116
I JUST HAD
A GOAT'S NUT
IN MY MOUTH?

24:44.116 --> 24:45.685
NO, IT'S A CHERRY.
IT'S A CHERRY.

24:45.685 --> 24:47.419
LOOK, IT'S
A MARASCHINO CHERRY.

24:47.419 --> 24:49.589
- ( groans )
- MMM, THERE YOU GO.

24:49.589 --> 24:51.991
TOO STRONG FOR YOU?

24:51.991 --> 24:54.060
NOT AT ALL.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.895
- LET'S HAVE ANOTHER.
- NO.

24:55.895 --> 24:57.964
NO, THIS IS
LETHAL STUFF.

24:57.964 --> 24:59.832
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

24:59.832 --> 25:01.601
- WAITRESS?!
- OH, NO.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.069
( hiccups )

25:03.069 --> 25:05.638
- HUEVO DE CHIVO.
- HUEVO DE CHIVO.

25:06.472 --> 25:08.440
- MMM.
- HAH!

25:08.440 --> 25:10.677
( loud exhale )

25:10.677 --> 25:12.511
( thunder rumbling )

25:12.511 --> 25:13.980
UH-OH.

25:13.980 --> 25:16.783
DID YOU BRING AN UMBRELLA,
MRS. WEATHER CHANNEL?

25:18.785 --> 25:20.452
65%?

25:20.452 --> 25:22.388
I MEAN, IF YOU'D SAID
85 OR 90--

25:22.388 --> 25:26.292
- ( whistles )
- YEAH, AND IT'S PRECISELY
THAT 25% EXTRA

25:26.292 --> 25:27.727
THAT YOU NEED AND I DON'T.

25:27.727 --> 25:29.395
AND THERE'S A DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN HOW YOU AND I

25:29.395 --> 25:30.797
NEED DIFFERENT
PERCENTAGES.

25:30.797 --> 25:34.934
BECAUSE IF MY STYLE
IS 6-5 AND YOU'RE 8-5...

25:34.934 --> 25:37.704
WHOOO!

25:37.704 --> 25:39.739
- I'M A LITTLE DRUNK.
- YEAH. ( whistles )

25:39.739 --> 25:41.340
WELL, AT LEAST
WE'LL BE EQUALLY HUNG OVER

25:41.340 --> 25:43.910
WHEN WE SEE
JUDGE ABRAMOVITZ
IN THE MORNING.

25:43.910 --> 25:47.313
YEAH, YOU AND HER,
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

25:47.313 --> 25:50.516
OH, MY MOUTH HAS GONE NUMB.
I CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING.

25:50.516 --> 25:53.219
CAN YOU?

25:58.357 --> 26:00.693
I FELT THAT OKAY.

26:00.693 --> 26:03.830
( giggling )
HEY. HEY, YOU'RE
NOT SUPPOSED-- YEAH.

26:03.830 --> 26:05.231
YOU?

26:07.634 --> 26:09.969
( both moaning )

26:28.220 --> 26:29.321
Audrey: OH!

26:29.321 --> 26:31.624
( Audrey screams )

26:31.624 --> 26:34.326
( Audrey giggling )

26:47.439 --> 26:48.975
( exhales )
OH MY GOD.

26:48.975 --> 26:51.310
- ( Rafferty whistling )
- WHAT HAVE I DONE?

26:51.310 --> 26:54.046
CUP OF COFFEE?
DUE IN COURT, 45 MINUTES.

26:54.046 --> 26:57.616
- CLOTHES ARE IN THE DRYER.
- ( gasps ) THE DRYER?

27:10.229 --> 27:13.800
I WORE PANTIES.
THAT MUCH I REMEMBER.

27:15.868 --> 27:18.337
DID I DO ANYTHING LAST NIGHT
I MIGHT REGRET?

27:18.337 --> 27:20.439
I HOPE NOT.

27:20.439 --> 27:23.242
OHH.
OH, DEAR. OH, DEAR.

27:23.242 --> 27:27.079
AT LEAST WE'LL
BOTH ARRIVE IN COURT
LOOKING LIKE HELL.

27:27.079 --> 27:28.647
READY?

27:28.647 --> 27:30.917
- OH, COME ON!
- WHAT'S WRONG?

27:30.917 --> 27:32.719
I MEAN, YOU ALWAYS SAY
I LOOK LIKE CRAP.

27:32.719 --> 27:34.921
DON'T YOU LIKE IT?
TIE LOOKS GOOD.

27:36.455 --> 27:39.125
$97 MILLION, YOUR HONOR.

27:39.125 --> 27:41.027
AND YET HE IS TRYING
TO HOLD MY CLIENT

27:41.027 --> 27:44.563
TO A PENURIOUS PRENUPTIAL
WHICH WE HAVE SHOWN
IS CLEARLY SUSPECT.

27:44.563 --> 27:47.166
MARY HARRISON IS ENTITLED
TO AT LEAST HALF OF HIS ASSETS

27:47.166 --> 27:49.869
AND A CONTINUING PERCENTAGE
OF PROFIT IN HIS CORPORATION.

27:49.869 --> 27:52.004
- YOU DON'T REALLY MEAN THAT.
- WHAT?

27:52.004 --> 27:53.672
I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT,
MS. WOODS,

27:53.672 --> 27:56.175
BUT ARE YOU SUGGESTING
THAT BECAUSE THE NUMBER
IS SO LARGE,

27:56.175 --> 27:59.879
YOUR CLIENT
IS ENTITLED TO MORE THAN
WAS AGREED UPON IN THE PRENUP?

27:59.879 --> 28:01.914
BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT
YOUR POSITION LAST NIGHT,

28:01.914 --> 28:04.316
ASSUMING YOU REMEMBER
LAST NIGHT'S...

28:04.316 --> 28:05.885
POSITION.

28:05.885 --> 28:09.455
I AM SPEAKING...
THIS MORNING

28:09.455 --> 28:11.290
OF TWO PEOPLE WHO ARE
HUSBAND AND WIFE--

28:11.290 --> 28:13.893
TWO PEOPLE WHO SHARED
EIGHT YEARS TOGETHER--

28:13.893 --> 28:16.428
A WIFE WHO IN THEIR MOST
INTIMATE MOMENTS

28:16.428 --> 28:18.765
INSPIRED HER HUSBAND'S
GREATEST CREATIONS.

28:18.765 --> 28:20.232
OH, WHAT DID YOU SAY?
IT WAS BRILLIANT.

28:20.232 --> 28:22.301
I WROTE IT DOWN SOMEWHERE.
UM... THERE YOU GO.

28:22.301 --> 28:23.335
HERE.

28:23.335 --> 28:27.273
UM... "INTIMACY
DOESN'T CHANGE A THING.

28:27.273 --> 28:29.508
BUSINESS IS BUSINESS."

28:29.508 --> 28:33.112
- HOW DARE YOU!
- Abramovitz: OKAY! OKAY!
THIS IS HOW I SEE IT.

28:33.112 --> 28:35.181
ACCORDING TO
THE STATE OF NEW YORK,

28:35.181 --> 28:36.749
MRS. HARRISON SIGNED
A PRENUPTIAL AGREEMENT

28:36.749 --> 28:39.185
THAT NO ONE HAS PROVEN
TO ME IS FLAWED IN ANY WAY.

28:39.185 --> 28:40.787
SO THE COURT FINDS
THE DOCUMENT HOLDS

28:40.787 --> 28:43.055
AND ASSETS SHALL BE DIVIDED
ACCORDING TO ITS PROVISIONS.

28:43.055 --> 28:44.656
- CASE DISMISSED.
- ( gavel strikes )

28:44.656 --> 28:47.593
AND WHATEVER THE TWO OF YOU
GOT GOING ON, TAKE IT OUTSIDE.

28:49.128 --> 28:52.664
YOU KNOW, I'VE COME TO THINK
WE HAVE A GREAT SUCCESS ON
OUR HANDS HERE AND UH--

28:52.664 --> 28:54.901
ONE MOMENT, PLEASE.

28:54.901 --> 28:57.169
- AUDREY! AUDREY, WAIT!
- ( chatter )

28:57.169 --> 29:00.306
AUDREY.
AUDREY, WAIT!
WAIT JUST ONE MOMENT.

29:00.306 --> 29:02.008
COME ON. COME ON,
LET ME EXPLAIN.

29:02.008 --> 29:04.010
PLEASE, JUST LET ME
EXPLAIN, ALL RIGHT?

29:04.010 --> 29:06.779
COUNSELOR,
YOU ARE NOW OPERATING
IN A MORALITY-FREE VOID

29:06.779 --> 29:09.615
- IN WHICH ALL BETS ARE OFF.
- YOU DON'T GET IT, DO YOU?

29:09.615 --> 29:12.218
- I JUST PAID YOU
THE ULTIMATE COMPLIMENT.
- COMPLIMENT?

29:12.218 --> 29:14.120
YOU FORCED ME TO FIGHT
DIRTIER IN THERE

29:14.120 --> 29:16.488
THAN I'VE
EVER HAD TO DO BEFORE.
THAT'S HOW GOOD YOU ARE.

29:16.488 --> 29:19.959
OH, PLEASE, SAVE
THE L.A. SCHMOOZE
FOR JUDGE JUDY.

29:19.959 --> 29:21.828
YOU OWE ME AN APOLOGY.

29:21.828 --> 29:24.363
LIKE THE APOLOGY
YOU GAVE ME LAST NIGHT?

29:24.363 --> 29:27.399
OKAY, I WAS TRYING
TO SOFTEN YOU UP.

29:27.399 --> 29:30.369
AND THEN I LET YOU SEDUCE ME
SO YOU'D THINK YOU HAD
THE UPPER HAND.

29:30.369 --> 29:32.538
YOU LET ME SEDUCE YOU?
YOU LET ME?

29:32.538 --> 29:35.707
- ARE YOU WOUNDED, MR. RAFFERTY?
- HEY, HEY, HEY, LAST NIGHT
WAS VERY SPECIAL.

29:35.707 --> 29:37.643
THERE'S NO NEED TO TRASH IT
JUST BECAUSE I BEAT YOU.

29:37.643 --> 29:40.079
HEY, YOU KNOW, YOU NEED
TO TOUGHEN UP A LITTLE BIT.

29:40.079 --> 29:42.114
IF I GOT BRUISED
BY EVERY LAWYER I BAGGED

29:42.114 --> 29:44.984
I'D LIVING IN A PADDED CELL
IN BELLEVUE BY NOW.

29:46.986 --> 29:49.788
YOU FINISHED WITH THESE?

29:53.392 --> 29:57.263
BAGGED?
YOU ACTUALLY USED
THE WORD "BAGGED"?

29:57.263 --> 29:59.866
RIGHT ON THE COURTHOUSE STEPS
IN THE 21ST CENTURY.

29:59.866 --> 30:02.301
( chuckling )
WOW. AND HOW MANY
HAVE YOU BAGGED?

30:02.301 --> 30:05.404
- NONE. THAT'S NOT
THE POINT, MOTHER.
- SHH-SHH!

30:06.705 --> 30:08.107
AUDREY, LOOK AT ME.

30:08.107 --> 30:11.077
I DON'T KNOW WHY
YOU HAVE DEVELOPED
THIS INABILITY

30:11.077 --> 30:12.879
TO ADMIT WHEN YOU'RE
ATTRACTED TO SOMEONE.

30:12.879 --> 30:14.546
IT'S NOT HEALTHY
AND YOU KNOW IT.

30:14.546 --> 30:16.682
AND ONE DAY,
I PROMISE YOU
YOU WILL WAKE UP

30:16.682 --> 30:18.550
WITH A WEDDING RING
ON YOUR FINGER

30:18.550 --> 30:20.887
AND YOU WILL BE
THE HAPPIEST PERSON
IN THE WORLD TO BE MARRIED.

30:20.887 --> 30:22.654
I AM NOT
ATTRACTED TO HIM.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.324
I JUST HATE
THAT DEALING WITH HIM
HAD TO GET SO LOW DOWN.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.959
YOU DECIDED
TO PRACTICE DIVORCE LAW.

30:26.959 --> 30:29.361
AT WHAT POINT DID YOU THINK
IT WAS GOING TO GET
REALLY CLASSY?

30:29.361 --> 30:32.364
( gasps )
THE NEW SERENAS.

30:32.364 --> 30:33.732
Audrey: WHO?

30:33.732 --> 30:37.003
SERENA, THE HOTTEST
NEW DESIGNER OUT THERE.

30:37.003 --> 30:38.837
- NEVER HEARD OF HER.
- OF COURSE YOU HAVE.

30:38.837 --> 30:41.440
- SHE'S MARRIED
TO THORNE JAMISON.
- WHO?

30:41.440 --> 30:43.642
HE'S THE LEAD SINGER
OF THE NEEDLES.

30:43.642 --> 30:47.046
HONEY, HE JUST SIGNED
A HUGE RECORDING CONTRACT--

30:47.046 --> 30:50.049
80 ZILLION OR SOMETHING.
OH, SERENA.

30:50.049 --> 30:53.585
SHE UNDERSTANDS
THE LAST THING TO GO
ON A WOMAN ARE HER SHOULDERS.

30:53.585 --> 30:56.255
SHE'S BOUND TO WIN
THE NOBEL PRIZE.

30:56.255 --> 30:58.257
AT LEAST.

31:08.935 --> 31:10.869
( exhales )
FOCUS, AUDREY, FOCUS!

31:10.869 --> 31:13.572
Well, actually
Mr. Harrison said
I inspired him

31:13.572 --> 31:16.008
to come up with one of
his new inventions. Uh...

31:16.008 --> 31:17.743
What's it called?
"The Paperpusher."

31:17.743 --> 31:19.811
Host:
Hu, did you get
a cut of that?

31:19.811 --> 31:22.148
Uh, no.
No, not at all.

31:22.148 --> 31:25.617
Uh, just winning
Gary's case was enough.

31:25.617 --> 31:28.955
Yes, and your
courtroom tussles
with Counselor Audrey Woods

31:28.955 --> 31:32.558
are becoming, uh, quite the talk
of the town in legal circles.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.260
( both chuckle )

31:34.260 --> 31:35.827
Well, well, well,
what can I say?

31:35.827 --> 31:38.897
I mean,
Audrey Woods is uh--

31:38.897 --> 31:41.767
- well, she's the finest
attorney I've ever met.
- HMM.

31:41.767 --> 31:44.403
- I can only aspire
to be as clever as her.
- RIGHT.

31:44.403 --> 31:46.973
She's uh--
she's wonderful.

31:46.973 --> 31:48.975
- Really wonderful.
- HUH?

31:48.975 --> 31:51.410
Host:
And you've just published
this book on divorce,

31:51.410 --> 31:55.381
- "For Better or Worse:
A Guide to a Happy Divorce."
- Rafferty: That's right.

31:55.381 --> 31:57.283
- BOOK? BOOK? WHAT BOOK?!
- It's got excellent reviews.

31:57.283 --> 31:58.684
WHEN DOES
HE WRITE BOOKS?!

31:58.684 --> 32:00.586
OUTSIDE OF NEW YORK'S
BIGGEST DIVORCE TRIAL

32:00.586 --> 32:02.488
SINCE GARY HARRISON'S
LAST APRIL,

32:02.488 --> 32:04.023
THE CASE
OF BASKETBALL LEGEND

32:04.023 --> 32:06.592
ADAMO SHANDELA
AND HIS WIFE IRENE--

32:06.592 --> 32:09.395
THE TRIAL WHICH
HAS TWO OF THE CITY'S
TOP DIVORCE PIT BULLS

32:09.395 --> 32:11.697
AUDREY WOODS
AND DANIEL RAFFERTY

32:11.697 --> 32:12.965
AGAINST EACH OTHER
ONCE AGAIN.

32:12.965 --> 32:14.533
NOW THE VERDICT
HAS JUST BEEN HANDED DOWN.

32:14.533 --> 32:16.568
WAIT A MINUTE, I'M TOLD
HE'S ON HIS WAY OUT.

32:16.568 --> 32:19.771
ADAMO, HOW DOES IT FEEL
TO HAVE THE VERDICT GO YOUR WAY?

32:19.771 --> 32:22.108
WELL, I JUST FEEL LUCKY
TO HAVE THE BEST LAWYER

32:22.108 --> 32:23.875
IN NEW YORK ON MY SIDE,
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

32:23.875 --> 32:27.213
MS. WOODS, IN A CASE
THAT'S HAD TO REVEAL
SO MUCH INDELICATE INFORMATION

32:27.213 --> 32:28.814
about the petitioner's
private life,

32:28.814 --> 32:30.416
you've really been commended
on your aboveboard tactics.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.151
It's all about
doing your homework,

32:32.151 --> 32:34.153
researching
every aspect of the law,

32:34.153 --> 32:36.822
burning the midnight oil--
you have to be prepared
for anything.

32:36.822 --> 32:38.490
You know, if it's one thing
that I've learned,

32:38.490 --> 32:41.660
it's don't get caught in court
with your pants down.

32:41.660 --> 32:44.796
( laughs )

32:44.796 --> 32:46.665
AH, THAT'S GOOD.

32:46.665 --> 32:50.169
OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.
COUNSEL IS, AS USUAL,
MAKING ASSUMPTIONS.

32:50.169 --> 32:51.403
OVERRULED, MS. WOODS!

32:51.403 --> 32:53.339
Rafferty:
OPPOSING COUNSEL IS

32:53.339 --> 32:55.107
CLEARLY KIDDING HERSELF
IS SHE REALLY--

32:55.107 --> 32:56.375
IRRELEVANT, MR. RAFFERTY.

32:56.375 --> 32:58.444
FULL DOCUMENTATION HERE,
YOUR HONOR.

32:58.444 --> 33:01.113
- EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW.
- VIDEOTAPES ARE IRRELEVANT,
MR. RAFFERTY.

33:01.113 --> 33:03.882
- NO ROOM FOR ARGUMENT.
- Audrey: OBJECTION, YOUR HONOR.
COUNSEL IS BADGERING.

33:03.882 --> 33:05.584
MOTION DENIED AGAIN,
MS. WOODS.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.186
GET OFF THE DESK,
MR. RAFFERTY.

33:07.186 --> 33:09.021
MS. WOODS,
THIS COURT HAS ABSOLUTELY

33:09.021 --> 33:12.724
NO INTEREST IN YOUR OPINION
OF MR. RAFFERTY'S
CHOICE OF SOCKS.

33:12.724 --> 33:16.195
MS. WOODS' CAPACITY FOR ALCOHOL
HAS NO RELEVANCE TO
THESE PROCEEDINGS.

33:16.195 --> 33:18.097
- BAILIFF!
- NO, CLEARLY YOU DID NOT,

33:18.097 --> 33:20.132
- Abramovitz:
COUNSELORS! COUNSELORS!
- BECAUSE-- NO, NO--

33:20.132 --> 33:22.734
IF I WANT TO SIT THROUGH
PERSONAL ATTACKS, YELLING,
SCREAMING

33:22.734 --> 33:24.903
FOUL LANGUAGE, BICKERING,
I'LL SPEND THE AFTERNOON

33:24.903 --> 33:28.140
- WITH MY FAMILY
IN SCARSDALE, UNDERSTAND?
- Both: YES, YOUR HONOR.

33:29.608 --> 33:31.910
Announcer on TV:
It may be cool though,
especially from Boston

33:31.910 --> 33:34.113
- northward here,
across parts of Maine...
- ( phone ringing )

33:34.113 --> 33:38.084
and throughout
portions of New England.
Only 52 in Burlington, 51 in--

33:38.084 --> 33:41.753
Audrey's voice:
It's Audrey. I'm not here
right now, so leave a message.

33:41.753 --> 33:44.223
EVEN IF I WAS HERE,
I WOULDN'T TAKE CALLS FROM YOU.

33:44.223 --> 33:46.425
Rafferty:
We both know that's not true.

33:46.425 --> 33:48.594
Listen,
I'm sorry to bother you,

33:48.594 --> 33:50.562
but it's really overcast
downtown here

33:50.562 --> 33:52.298
and I thought
you just might have
an inside track

33:52.298 --> 33:53.665
from The Weather Channel,
you know,

33:53.665 --> 33:56.135
and what time it's gonna
start raining.

33:57.769 --> 34:00.606
Okay.

34:00.606 --> 34:02.608
Look, if you want me
to leave you alone, I will.

34:02.608 --> 34:05.677
But for the record
I think it's a great shame.

34:05.677 --> 34:09.315
So... take care.

34:09.315 --> 34:11.049
- HELLO?
- Oh, you are there.

34:11.049 --> 34:14.120
YEAH, I JUST PICKED UP THE PHONE
TO TELL YOU TO LEAVE ME ALONE.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.786
I JUST SAID I WAS GOING
TO LEAVE YOU ALONE.

34:15.786 --> 34:18.123
I know, I'm just telling you
that I want you to.

34:18.123 --> 34:19.858
YOU DON'T MEAN THAT.

34:19.858 --> 34:22.393
- TRUST ME.
- On the first bit
or the second bit?

34:22.393 --> 34:24.062
- BOTH.
- I'm confused.

34:24.062 --> 34:26.132
- WHAT ABOUT?
- I'M NOT SURE.

34:26.132 --> 34:28.833
- PERHAPS YOU COULD
SEND ME A TAPE OF THIS.
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

34:28.833 --> 34:31.437
- Have dinner with me.
- I'M NOT HUNGRY.

34:31.437 --> 34:34.239
- I didn't mean right now.
- WELL, NEITHER DID I.

34:34.239 --> 34:35.873
- ( door opens )
- Sara: HONEY!

34:35.873 --> 34:37.176
I HAVE TO GO.

34:39.178 --> 34:41.313
( turns on TV,
reporter continues )

34:41.313 --> 34:43.849
SO THIS IS HOW YOU'RE
SPENDING SATURDAY NIGHT,

34:43.849 --> 34:47.085
EATING JUNK FOOD AND WATCHING
THE WEATHER CHANNEL?

34:47.085 --> 34:50.054
I HAVE TICKETS
TO THORNE JAMISON
AND THE NEEDLES.

34:50.054 --> 34:52.690
- LET'S GO.
- TO A ROCK CONCERT?

34:52.690 --> 34:55.793
SEX, DRUGS AND ROCK AND ROLL
IS YOUR THING, MOM, NOT MINE.

34:55.793 --> 35:00.366
* GET READY
TO ROLL BACK THE DICE *

35:02.834 --> 35:06.672
* FREDDY'S BURNING UP
IN SATAN'S FAHRENHEIT *

35:06.672 --> 35:09.975
* CRASH LANDING
FROM A SNOWBALL PARASITE *

35:09.975 --> 35:17.449
* TELEVISION IS THE DEVIL'S
CHOSEN FUN *

35:17.449 --> 35:21.086
- * OHHH *
- * SINGING AT THE MOON *

35:21.086 --> 35:24.856
* SEASIDE PLEASURE
AND ALL THAT SHAGGING AROUND *

35:24.856 --> 35:28.994
* FALL INTO YOUR HEAD,
SHE SAID WHAT SHE SAID *

35:28.994 --> 35:32.798
* GET READY
TO ROLL BACK THE DICE *

35:32.798 --> 35:36.468
* FALL OUT OF YOUR BED,
WE'LL WAKE UP THE DEAD *

35:36.468 --> 35:39.871
* GET READY
TO ROLL BACK THE DICE. *

35:39.871 --> 35:44.376
- ( band continues within )
- OH MY GOD, I THINK I'M DEAF.

35:46.077 --> 35:48.280
( crying )

35:50.216 --> 35:52.484
HEY, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

35:54.253 --> 35:56.288
DO YOU WANT
TO TELL ME ABOUT IT?

35:56.288 --> 35:59.658
HE'S AN ASSHOLE.

35:59.658 --> 36:01.393
I HATE HIM.

36:01.393 --> 36:04.363
HE'S SCREWS EVERYTHING.

36:04.363 --> 36:06.965
IF I DON'T DIVORCE HIM,
I'M GONNA KILL HIM!

36:06.965 --> 36:08.534
UGH!

36:08.534 --> 36:11.770
LISTEN, CAN I GIVE YOU
SOME ADVICE?

36:11.770 --> 36:13.439
YOU'RE VERY YOUNG.

36:13.439 --> 36:14.973
RELATIONSHIPS TAKE WORK,

36:14.973 --> 36:17.609
AND-- AND LOTS OF COUPLES
GO THROUGH ROUGH PATCHES.

36:17.609 --> 36:20.246
AND THERE'S ALWAYS A WAY
TO GET THROUGH THEM.

36:20.246 --> 36:22.381
YOU KNOW, DIVORCE
SHOULD BE A LAST RESORT.

36:22.381 --> 36:25.251
THIS IS SOMETHING
I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT.

36:25.251 --> 36:27.553
YOU'RE WEARING
MY BLOUSE WRONG.

36:27.553 --> 36:30.256
IT SHOULD BE WORN
OFF THE SHOULDER.

36:30.256 --> 36:32.458
YOU HAVE NICE SHOULDERS.

36:33.892 --> 36:35.761
ARE YOU SERENA?

36:37.729 --> 36:41.367
- SO YOUR HUSBAND IS--
- THE FATHEAD ON STAGE? YEAH.

36:43.134 --> 36:44.936
LET ME GIVE YOU MY CARD.

36:51.009 --> 36:52.611
( screaming )

36:54.012 --> 36:56.382
Audrey:
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW,
MRS. JAMISON,

36:56.382 --> 36:58.984
THAT IF YOU SHOULD CHOOSE
KATZ, COHEN & PHELPS,

36:58.984 --> 37:00.819
I TAKE CARE OF MY CLIENTS.

37:00.819 --> 37:03.822
WE ARE CONSIDERED THE TIFFANY'S
OF NEW YORK LAW FIRMS.

37:03.822 --> 37:07.426
YEAH, WELL, I WISH
IT WAS HOME DEPOT

37:07.426 --> 37:09.961
SO YOU COULD
RIP HIS HEART OUT
WITH A CHAINSAW.

37:11.563 --> 37:14.566
WELL, THERE'S
THAT APPROACH TOO.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.936
- ( cork pops )
- HERE'S TO AUDREY
AND HER NEW CLIENT SERENA,

37:17.936 --> 37:20.439
AND ALL THE MONEY
SHE'S GOING TO BRING IN
TO THE COMPANY.

37:20.439 --> 37:23.241
- NO, IT'S NOT DEFINITE YET.
- ( mimics ) IT'S NOT
DEFINITE YET.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.777
- THE GENTLEMAN ASKED ME
TO SEND YOU THIS.
- Audrey: THANK YOU.

37:33.118 --> 37:35.387
Attorney:
WHAT IN GOD'S NAME
IS THAT?

37:35.387 --> 37:39.257
- YOU'VE NEVER
HAD A GOAT'S NUT?
- I CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE.

37:40.326 --> 37:42.928
Woman:
HEY, MAN, WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:49.468 --> 37:51.970
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT?

37:53.405 --> 37:55.807
DO YOU THINK THAT'S REALLY
A GOAT'S NUT IN THERE?

38:02.348 --> 38:03.782
OH, MS. WOODS,
LOOK AT THAT.

38:03.782 --> 38:05.817
UH, I SEE YOU'RE
CELEBRATING OVER THERE.

38:05.817 --> 38:08.687
- WOULD YOU LIKE TO JOIN US?
- AH, I JUST WANTED TO SAY
HELLO TO SERENA.

38:08.687 --> 38:11.490
WELL, YOU'RE A FAN.
WELL, WHO ISN'T?

38:11.490 --> 38:15.093
UH, SERENA, AUDREY WOODS.
SERENA'S MY NEW CLIENT.

38:15.093 --> 38:18.464
- SADLY, SHE'S
GETTING A DIVORCE.
- YES, I KNOW.

38:18.464 --> 38:20.198
OH, YOU DO?

38:20.198 --> 38:22.167
OH WELL, I GUESS
THESE THINGS HIT THE PAPERS.

38:22.167 --> 38:24.970
NO, I KNOW, BECAUSE
UP UNTIL 30 SECONDS AGO

38:24.970 --> 38:27.373
I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING
TO HIRE ME TO REPRESENT HER.

38:27.373 --> 38:29.040
- WHAT?
- THAT'S A GOOD LOOK, COUNSELOR.

38:29.040 --> 38:31.176
DID YOU PRACTICE THAT
IN THE MIRROR?

38:31.176 --> 38:33.645
HEY, I DECIDED
TO USE SOMEONE ELSE.

38:33.645 --> 38:35.581
THING IS, IN THE MEETIN'
YOU WERE ALL UP IN THAT

38:35.581 --> 38:39.184
"HIGH ROAD,
LET'S KEEP IT CLEAN,
NO NEED TO GET UGLY" STUFF.

38:39.184 --> 38:41.653
THEN I READ HIS BOOK.

38:41.653 --> 38:43.789
DANNY'S WHAT I WANT.

38:43.789 --> 38:46.792
HE'LL CUT THORNE'S BALLS OFF
AND GIVE 'EM BACK AS EARRINGS.

38:46.792 --> 38:49.828
BUT IN ALL FAIRNESS, UH,
SERENA, IT SHOULD BE NOTED

38:49.828 --> 38:52.531
THAT MS. WOODS IS VERY CAPABLE
OF CUTTING MEN'S BALLS OFF.

38:52.531 --> 38:54.466
ALL RIGHT.
( scoffs )

38:54.466 --> 38:56.668
SORRY, THAT CAME OUT
ALL WRONG.

38:56.668 --> 38:59.638
UM, JUST SO YOU KNOW,
THE JACKET WASN'T DESIGNED

38:59.638 --> 39:01.507
TO BE WORN WITH A BELT.

39:03.875 --> 39:05.544
OKAY.

39:24.229 --> 39:26.364
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

39:30.301 --> 39:32.370
YOU STOLE SERENA
TO SPITE ME.

39:35.140 --> 39:36.542
COME ON IN.

39:36.542 --> 39:38.744
CUBICLE 2 IS FREE,
I BELIEVE.

39:38.744 --> 39:40.579
I DIDN'T STEAL ANYTHING.

39:40.579 --> 39:42.113
SHE READ MY BOOK
AND CAME TO ME, I MEAN IT.

39:42.113 --> 39:44.015
I DON'T THINK
YOU MEAN ANYTHING YOU SAY.

39:44.015 --> 39:47.052
WELL, THAT, I'M AFRAID,
IS GONNA HAVE TO REMAIN
YOUR PROBLEM.

39:47.052 --> 39:49.220
- BUT... I DON'T LIE.
- ( zips )

39:49.220 --> 39:52.123
I DON'T APPROVE OF IT.
WHEN HAVE I EVER LIED TO YOU?

39:52.123 --> 39:55.994
- ( water running )
- WELL, LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, BUDDY,

39:55.994 --> 39:57.929
IF YOU ARE TAKING
THIS CASE TO MESS WITH ME,

39:57.929 --> 40:00.298
THINGS ARE GONNA GET
REALLY UGLY.

40:00.298 --> 40:01.900
UGLIER THAN THIS?

40:01.900 --> 40:04.335
AND LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING, IF I MAY--

40:04.335 --> 40:07.138
IF YOU WERE ABLE TO TURN DOWN
YOUR SELF-SERVING PARANOIA

40:07.138 --> 40:09.941
TO A GENTLE SIMMER
FOR A BRIEF MOMENT,
YOU MIGHT JUST DISCOVER

40:09.941 --> 40:12.511
THAT YOU AND I COULD ACTUALLY
CO-EXIST QUITE SUCCESSFULLY.

40:12.511 --> 40:15.447
AND I DON'T MEAN
ONLY PROFESSIONALLY.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.819
DON'T FORGET
TO WASH YOUR HANDS.

40:23.088 --> 40:26.692
WHAT, ARE YOU...
GOING FOR A WORLD RECORD?

40:27.726 --> 40:29.294
Thorne:
HELLO, GIRLS.

40:29.294 --> 40:32.964
- ALL RIGHT, FORM IN A QUEUE.
- TAKE THIS, TAKE THIS.

40:32.964 --> 40:34.966
I'M SURE I CAN
FIT YOU ALL IN.

40:34.966 --> 40:36.802
WHAT'S YOUR NAME,
MY LITTLE GIRL?

40:36.802 --> 40:39.037
- CINDY. HEY, SIGN IT.
- YEAH? I HAD A DOG
CALLED THAT ONE.

40:39.037 --> 40:41.840
- Thorne: AND HOW LONG HAVE
YOU BEEN A "THORNEHEAD"?
- Girl #1: FOREVER.

40:41.840 --> 40:44.576
- Girl #2: I LOVE YOU, THORNE!
- YEAH, I LOVE YOU TOO, BABE.

40:45.511 --> 40:47.913
( girls giggle )

40:49.347 --> 40:50.816
SEE THIS, BARRY.

40:50.816 --> 40:53.852
I'VE GOT CLASSY FANS TOO.
( chuckles )

40:55.487 --> 40:58.690
AND UH...
WHAT MIGHT YOU WANT?

40:58.690 --> 41:00.592
I WANT YOU.

41:00.592 --> 41:03.394
OOH, CHIHUAHUA!

41:03.394 --> 41:04.930
NICE OPENING LINE.
I LIKE IT.

41:04.930 --> 41:08.199
DIRECT, NO B.S.--
JUST HOW I LIKE IT.

41:08.199 --> 41:10.001
MMM.

41:10.001 --> 41:13.004
OKAY, TELL ME WHAT
WE'RE WORKING WITH,
DOLL FACE.

41:13.004 --> 41:17.108
OKAY, THIS IS WHAT
WE'RE WORKING WITH,
DOLL FACE.

41:17.108 --> 41:19.144
YOU'VE GOT A DEVOTED,
HARDWORKING WIFE AT HOME,

41:19.144 --> 41:23.014
AND YET YOU CHEAT,
LIE, AND BLOW ALL YOUR MONEY
ON STRIPPERS AND WHORES.

41:23.014 --> 41:26.151
YOU FINALLY ABANDONED HER,
LEAVING HER NO OPTION BUT
TO FILE FOR DIVORCE.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.253
THAT'S THE OPPOSING COUNSEL'S
OPENING LINE.

41:28.253 --> 41:30.822
DIRECT, NO B.S.--
JUST THE WAY YOU LIKE IT.

41:30.822 --> 41:35.360
AND YOUR WIFE HAS JUST HIRED
THE SECOND BEST DIVORCE ATTORNEY
IN NEW YORK CITY TO DELIVER IT.

41:35.360 --> 41:39.931
NOW YOU NEED SOMEONE TO TELL
YOUR SIDE OF THE STORY,
NO MATTER HOW SORDID,

41:39.931 --> 41:43.802
AND MAKE YOU SEEM LIKE
STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE.

41:46.572 --> 41:49.374
I LIKE
STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE,

41:49.374 --> 41:51.610
AND I LIKE YOUR STYLE.

41:51.610 --> 41:53.679
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

41:53.679 --> 41:56.314
I THINK WE SHOULD CONTINUE
THIS CONVERSATION...

41:56.314 --> 41:57.816
BACK AT MY PLACE.

41:57.816 --> 41:59.585
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?
- WHAT?

41:59.585 --> 42:02.053
I THINK YOU SHOULD LEAVE
THE THINKING TO ME.

42:05.056 --> 42:06.625
RIGHT.

42:06.625 --> 42:09.294
PAIN? I'LL CAUSE HER
SO MUCH PAIN SHE'LL
WISH SHE NEVER...

42:09.294 --> 42:11.396
BEFORE I CAME ALONG, THE ONLY
BUSINESS DECISION HE EVER MADE

42:11.396 --> 42:13.364
WAS WHETHER TO PAY A HOOKER
WITH CASH OR CREDIT.

42:13.364 --> 42:15.533
...THE PURPOSE OF
A SETTLEMENT HEARING
IS TO AVOID...

42:15.533 --> 42:18.136
YOU SHOULD ADVISE YOUR CLIENT
THAT DOCUMENTABLE THREATS
OF VIOLENCE...

42:18.136 --> 42:20.005
- MAKES MY JOB SO MUCH EASIER.
- Serena: THREATS, MY ASS!

42:20.005 --> 42:22.207
CAN WE SKIP TO THE PART
WHERE YOU CUT HIS BALLS OFF?!

42:25.944 --> 42:29.781
IF WE COULD CONVINCE MS. WOODS
TO GO THROUGH THE MOTIONS
OF DISCUSSING ASSETS.

42:29.781 --> 42:31.717
Thorne:
ASSETS? SHE DOESN'T
HAVE ANY.

42:31.717 --> 42:34.786
I'M THE ONE WHO SPITS UP
ALL THE MONEY FOR THOSE
DISH RAGS SHE SELLS.

42:34.786 --> 42:37.288
DISH RAGS?
TELL THAT TO NICOLE KIDMAN.

42:37.288 --> 42:41.092
- SHE WORE MY DISHRAGS
TO THE OSCARS, OKAY?!
- NYAH, NYAH, NYAH...

42:41.092 --> 42:43.762
I'M SURE THAT
MR. RAFFERTY WILL AGREE
THAT WE'LL NOT GET ANYWHERE

42:43.762 --> 42:45.463
WITHOUT A DEGREE
OF CONSIDERATION
FROM ALL PARTIES.

42:45.463 --> 42:47.799
CONSIDERATION FROM HIM?
I'M HIS GODDAMN WIFE.

42:47.799 --> 42:50.301
AND HE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE
THE COURTESY TO TELL ME
THAT HE GOT

42:50.301 --> 42:54.072
A SKULL AND CROSS BONES
PIERCED THROUGH THE TIP
OF HIS--

42:54.072 --> 42:55.974
- I HAVE ENOUGH.
- I'M GOOD.

42:55.974 --> 42:56.942
MMM.

42:58.243 --> 43:01.046
LOOK, FORGET IT, OKAY?
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN HIS MONEY.

43:01.046 --> 43:03.849
I MAKE A GOOD LIVING.
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING I WANT.

43:03.849 --> 43:07.118
- UH-HUH, AND WHAT IS THAT?
- CAISLEáN AND CLOCHA.

43:07.118 --> 43:09.721
OH, YES, I REMEMBER
SEEING THAT SOMEWHERE.
WHAT IS IT?

43:09.721 --> 43:11.923
IT'S THE MOST
MAGICAL PLACE ON EARTH.

43:11.923 --> 43:15.226
- MMM.
- IT'S OUR CASTLE IN IRELAND.

43:15.226 --> 43:17.863
IT'S MY FAIRYTALE CASTLE.

43:19.130 --> 43:22.133
* IT'S SUMMER NOW,
THE KIDS ARE BACK INSIDE *

43:22.133 --> 43:24.870
- ( both scream )
- * GOTTA TICKET FOR A... *

43:24.870 --> 43:28.740
Ha-ha. And in here,
this is the-- stay.

43:28.740 --> 43:32.010
- Thorne on TV: This is where
we like to rehearse...
- STAY. HA-HA.

43:32.010 --> 43:35.881
jam with the boys in the band.
This is where I like to play
with my fruit machines.

43:35.881 --> 43:38.717
Feeling lucky.
Feeling lucky!

43:40.986 --> 43:42.587
- ( rimshot )
- Ahh.

43:42.587 --> 43:46.257
Uh, gold, gold,
gold, gold, silver.

43:46.257 --> 43:48.927
Who's is that?
That's not mine. Billy!

43:48.927 --> 43:53.431
- I HADN'T BECOME
MY TRUE SELF AT THAT POINT.
- ( Thorne screaming on TV )

43:53.431 --> 43:57.002
I WAS STILL A BIT...
STUPID.

43:57.002 --> 43:59.838
And it's got
like 100 bedrooms.

43:59.838 --> 44:01.807
I don't know,
maybe even less.

44:01.807 --> 44:04.242
Serena uses one
for her hobbies, and she--

44:04.242 --> 44:06.778
she likes to sew stuff.
Oh, here she is.

44:06.778 --> 44:08.714
I love him, I love him,
I love him!

44:08.714 --> 44:10.849
- Isn't she great?
- He's all mine!

44:10.849 --> 44:14.419
- He's all mine!
- SHE MAY HAVE BEEN
ON DRUGS AT THAT POINT.

44:14.419 --> 44:17.455
- Thorne:
Nah, just you, baby.
- YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE THAT.

44:17.455 --> 44:19.024
( lips smacking )

44:19.925 --> 44:22.060
Oh, and come
and see my wheels.

44:22.060 --> 44:24.129
Billy!

44:24.129 --> 44:27.132
- OKAY, THAT WAS GOOD.
- ( TV turns off )

44:28.133 --> 44:29.868
SO THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT?

44:29.868 --> 44:31.469
KEZZLIN AND KLOIK.

44:31.469 --> 44:34.873
CLOCHA.
CAISLEáN CLOCHA.

44:34.873 --> 44:36.607
RIGHT. SO THIS IS
WHAT YOU WANT?

44:36.607 --> 44:39.945
YEAH.
IT MEANS "CASTLE OF ROCK."

44:39.945 --> 44:41.346
I MEAN, HOW MANY MORE...

44:41.346 --> 44:45.550
APPROPRIATE CAN YOU GET,
YOU KNOW?

44:45.550 --> 44:47.719
UH, WHEN I FOUND THAT OUT,
I HAD TO HAVE IT, RIGHT?

44:47.719 --> 44:49.387
AND IT WAS
YOUR DECISION TO BUY,

44:49.387 --> 44:52.690
UH, CAIS-- CAISL-- LE CLE--
THE CASTLE-- THE ROCK CASTLE?

44:52.690 --> 44:54.359
HELL YES.

44:54.359 --> 44:56.361
ALL RIGHT.

44:56.361 --> 44:59.965
I TOLD THORNE
"WE HAVE TO LIVE HERE."

44:59.965 --> 45:01.933
SO IT WAS YOUR DECISION
TO BUY IT?

45:01.933 --> 45:04.102
I CALLED
THE REALTOR RIGHT AWAY, YEAH.

45:04.102 --> 45:07.405
- ( phone rings )
- MMM. HELLO?

45:07.405 --> 45:10.375
OH, HELLO, COUNSELOR.

45:12.911 --> 45:15.480
YES, I MAY HAVE
GOOD NEWS TOO.

45:15.480 --> 45:20.651
WELL, IT LOOKS AS THOUGH
THIS THING MIGHT END
AMICABLY AFTER ALL.

45:20.651 --> 45:22.453
YES.

45:22.453 --> 45:26.224
WE'RE IN SERIOUS DANGER
OF PEACE BREAKING OUT.

45:27.225 --> 45:30.161
WHICH WILL MAKE ME
VERY HAPPY INDEED.

45:32.497 --> 45:34.432
ME TOO.

45:36.067 --> 45:38.269
- ANYWAY, I HAVE SPOKEN
TO MY CLIENT.
- SO HAVE I.

45:38.269 --> 45:40.071
- SHE ONLY WANTS THE--
- HE ONLY WANTS THE--

45:40.071 --> 45:43.141
- SHE ONLY WANTS THE--
- HE ONLY WANTS THE--

45:48.013 --> 45:51.282
Abramovitz:
GO TO IRELAND, DEPOSE
THE STAFF AT THE CASTLE,

45:51.282 --> 45:54.019
- AND WE'LL SORT THIS OUT.
- Audrey: YES, YOUR HONOR.

46:17.175 --> 46:20.778
OH, I SEE.
YOU'RE AFTER HIRING A CAR.

46:20.778 --> 46:24.082
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE,
MR. O'CALLAGHAN.

46:24.082 --> 46:26.584
OH, WELL, YOU'VE COME
TO THE RIGHT PLACE.

46:26.584 --> 46:27.986
GOOD.

46:27.986 --> 46:30.021
ONLY SEE, THING IS,

46:30.021 --> 46:32.323
WE'RE NOT OPEN
ON A TUESDAY.

46:32.323 --> 46:33.892
SORRY?

46:33.892 --> 46:36.862
YEAH, SEE, I'M NOT HERE
ON A TUESDAY.

46:38.529 --> 46:41.132
I KNOW, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

46:41.132 --> 46:43.568
IF I'M NOT HERE
ON A TUESDAY

46:43.568 --> 46:45.937
AND WE'RE NOT OPEN
ON A TUESDAY

46:45.937 --> 46:48.940
AND TODAY IS TUESDAY
AND I'M STANDING HERE,

46:48.940 --> 46:51.109
THEN HOW CAN IT BE?

46:51.109 --> 46:55.046
WELL NOW, IT ALL DEPENDS
ON HOW YOU LOOK AT IT.

46:55.046 --> 46:57.448
YOU SEE, NORMALLY...

47:02.220 --> 47:04.422
( Audrey mimicking O'Callaghan )
SEE, IF IT'S TUESDAY,

47:04.422 --> 47:08.026
AND I'M NOT THERE
EVEN THOUGH IT'S TUESDAY,

47:08.026 --> 47:10.661
COME BACK SOMETIME
WHEN IT'S NOT TUESDAY.

47:10.661 --> 47:14.432
( muttering )

47:17.068 --> 47:20.105
( sheep bleating )

47:38.523 --> 47:40.625
HEY!

47:40.625 --> 47:42.961
HEY!

47:42.961 --> 47:45.363
EXCUSE ME!

47:45.363 --> 47:47.933
EXCUSE ME!

47:50.835 --> 47:53.038
THANK YOU SO MUCH.
COULD YOU PLEASE--

47:53.038 --> 47:54.872
WHERE DID YOU GET
THIS GODDAMN THING?

47:54.872 --> 47:58.443
( Irish accent )
TOP OF THE MORNIN' TO YOU.
CAISLEáN CLOCHA, IS IT?

47:58.443 --> 47:59.911
HOP IN.

48:00.946 --> 48:02.747
IN THERE? WITH YOU?

48:02.747 --> 48:04.950
OH, OKAY.

48:04.950 --> 48:07.252
WELL, IT'S REALLY
NOT THAT FAR.

48:07.252 --> 48:09.820
I MEAN, YOU JUST CARRY ON
STRAIGHT DOWN THIS ROAD HERE.

48:09.820 --> 48:13.258
AFTER ABOUT, OH, EIGHT MILES
YOU'LL SEE A SIGNPOST

48:13.258 --> 48:15.226
FOR THE DEVIL'S STAIRCASE
AND UH...

48:15.226 --> 48:17.562
WELL, APPARENTLY THE CASTLE
IS JUST THE OTHER SIDE.

48:20.665 --> 48:22.667
Audrey:
SO, WHERE
DID YOU GET IT?

48:22.667 --> 48:25.103
Rafferty:
UH, MR. O'CALLAGHAN
BACK IN THE VILLAGE.

48:25.103 --> 48:26.804
HE'S NOT OPEN
ON A TUESDAY.

48:26.804 --> 48:29.440
NO, I BORROWED THIS
FROM MR. O'CALLAGHAN
THE BUTCHER DOWN THE ROAD.

48:29.440 --> 48:31.676
HE'S MR. O'CALLAGHAN,
THE CAR HIRE MAN'S, UNCLE.

48:31.676 --> 48:34.445
- AND YOU SEE, EVERY TUESDAY--
- Audrey: I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

48:41.987 --> 48:44.489
Audrey:
OH, IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

48:46.191 --> 48:48.293
IF YOU CAN
TOUCH THE HORIZON

48:48.293 --> 48:51.596
YOU'RE NEAR
YOUR JOURNEY'S END.

48:51.596 --> 48:53.831
JAMES JOYCE?

48:53.831 --> 48:56.401
NO, MY UNCLE CLIVE.

48:56.401 --> 49:00.071
BUT EQUALLY PROFOUND,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

49:09.580 --> 49:12.617
( car crashes )

49:14.485 --> 49:16.654
WELL, THAT
SPOILED IT FOR ME.

49:18.256 --> 49:22.193
WHAT AM I GOING TO TELL
MR. O'CALLAGHAN?

49:23.661 --> 49:26.964
- ( bird hooting )
- ( Rafferty sighs )

49:30.701 --> 49:34.139
ISN'T FOG
THE MOST INCREDIBLE
NATURAL PHENOMENON?

49:34.139 --> 49:36.274
SEE, IN ROCKY AREAS
LIKE THIS,

49:36.274 --> 49:38.543
THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ROCKS
IN THE DAYTIME

49:38.543 --> 49:42.280
IS MUCH COOLER THAN THE EARTH
SO... WHAT HAPPENS?

49:42.280 --> 49:44.282
WEATHER CHANNEL.

49:44.282 --> 49:46.617
( bird hooting )

49:48.253 --> 49:50.588
- IT IS NOW MIDNIGHT.
- LOOK, LOOK.

49:50.588 --> 49:53.224
I KNOW WE'RE A BIT LOST,
I ADMIT THAT,

49:53.224 --> 49:56.561
BUT WE'RE VERY CLOSE.
WE'RE VERY CLOSE,
I CAN SMELL IT.

49:56.561 --> 49:59.797
- SEE, I THINK IF...
- WAIT A SECOND.

49:59.797 --> 50:02.200
- WHAT?
- Audrey: LOOK, OVER HERE.

50:02.200 --> 50:04.769
THERE'S
SOME OLD TRAILER.

50:04.769 --> 50:06.704
( metal door banging )

50:10.475 --> 50:12.043
OHH.

50:12.043 --> 50:13.978
OH MY GOD!

50:13.978 --> 50:15.513
I THINK WE'VE
LANDED ON OUR FEET.

50:15.513 --> 50:17.682
SEE IF YOU CAN GET
SOME LIGHT GOING.

50:17.682 --> 50:20.485
OH YEAH,
THEN I'LL RUN YOUR BATH
AND GET DINNER ON.

50:20.485 --> 50:23.788
HEY, LISTEN, WE'RE
IN THIS TOGETHER.
WE'RE A TEAM, OKAY?

50:23.788 --> 50:25.956
YEAH, FOR NOW.

50:25.956 --> 50:27.692
WHOO, IT STINKS!

50:27.692 --> 50:29.160
THERE WE GO.

50:29.160 --> 50:31.529
WELL, ALL IN ALL,
I THINK WE'VE DONE
QUITE WELL.

50:31.529 --> 50:33.931
- WE?
- HEY, LISTEN, I GOT
THE LIGHT GOING, DIDN'T I?

50:33.931 --> 50:37.235
OH YEAH, FORGIVE ME.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD
HAVE DONE WITHOUT YOU.

50:37.235 --> 50:39.704
ACTUALLY, I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU DO IT.

50:39.704 --> 50:41.772
YOU WRITE BOOKS,
YOU APPEAR ON TV,

50:41.772 --> 50:45.376
YOU PERFORM YOUR
STAND UP ROUTINE IN COURT.

50:46.511 --> 50:48.779
ARE YOU TAKING
YOUR CLOTHES OFF?

50:48.779 --> 50:50.481
WELL, JUST-- JUST--
JUST THE BOTTOMS.

50:50.481 --> 50:52.583
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
THEY'RE COVERED IN SLIME.

50:52.583 --> 50:54.985
( sniffs )
UGH! WHY DID I DO THAT?

50:54.985 --> 50:58.556
AND IN YOUR SPARE TIME,
YOU WORK FOR THE IRISH
TOURIST BOARD.

50:58.556 --> 51:02.227
- AND YOUR POINT IS?
- I WAS DOING FINE ON MY OWN.

51:02.227 --> 51:04.028
OH, COME ON,
LET'S BE HONEST.

51:04.028 --> 51:06.331
YOU WERE LOST
UNTIL I CAME ALONG.

51:06.331 --> 51:08.666
OH, SLIGHTLY METAPHORICAL.

51:10.000 --> 51:11.769
- ANYWAY, COME ON.
- ( knocks )

51:11.769 --> 51:14.839
LIE DOWN.
YOU LOOK TIRED.
YOU NEED TO REST.

51:14.839 --> 51:19.610
WHAT, SO YOU CAN GET
TO CAISLEáN CLICK
BEFORE ME?

51:19.610 --> 51:21.512
IT'S NOT "CLICK."

51:21.512 --> 51:25.150
- IT'S CLOCHA.
- ( mimics ) CLOCHA.

51:25.150 --> 51:28.453
- CAISLEáN CLOCHA.
- KLUHH-- KUHH.

51:28.453 --> 51:30.821
CLOCHA-- IT'S NOT EVEN A WORD.
WHAT KIND OF A WORD IS THAT?

51:30.821 --> 51:33.391
IT'S AN IRISH WORD.
WE'RE IN IRELAND.
LEARN TO ADAPT.

51:33.391 --> 51:36.026
I CAN ADAPT.
I'M VERY ADAPTABLE
AS A MATTER OF FACT.

51:36.026 --> 51:38.329
- I'M PROBABLY MORE
ADAPTABLE THAN YOU.
- OH.

51:38.329 --> 51:39.997
- AND A WORD OF ADVICE.
- YES?

51:39.997 --> 51:41.966
NEVER TELL A WOMAN
SHE LOOKS TIRED.

51:41.966 --> 51:44.835
BOY, YOU JUST
SUMMED YOURSELF UP
IN ONE SENTENCE.

51:44.835 --> 51:48.473
ALL-CONSUMING,
COMPETITIVE SPIRIT
MEETS RAMPANT INSECURITY.

51:48.473 --> 51:50.741
NOW WHY-- WHY WOULD
SOMEONE AS ACCOMPLISHED

51:50.741 --> 51:55.913
AND AS CLEVER AS YOU
BE SO INSECURE, HMM?

51:55.913 --> 51:57.982
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

51:57.982 --> 52:01.352
YOU SPEND YOUR TEENAGE YEARS
AS THE PIMPLY, GANGLY DAUGHTER

52:01.352 --> 52:03.188
OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN IN THE WORLD,

52:03.188 --> 52:05.556
AND GET BACK TO ME.

52:11.061 --> 52:13.398
YOU BETTER NOT LEAVE ME.

52:23.107 --> 52:25.276
NEVER.

52:26.277 --> 52:28.179
( groans )

52:38.789 --> 52:40.825
OH.

52:44.695 --> 52:46.464
( sighs )

52:46.464 --> 52:49.367
OH MY LORD.

52:52.870 --> 52:55.640
- WE WERE THIS CLOSE?
- UH-HUH.

52:55.640 --> 52:59.410
THE HELL WITH
THORNE AND SERENA.
I WANT IT.

53:01.346 --> 53:04.715
WELL, DUTY CALLS.

53:04.715 --> 53:06.551
YEP.

53:11.289 --> 53:13.458
Audrey:
SO YOU THINK YOU
CAN GET THE SERVANTS

53:13.458 --> 53:15.092
TO BACK UP
YOUR CLAIM?

53:15.092 --> 53:17.728
Rafferty:
WELL, I GUESS
WE'LL FIND OUT.

53:17.728 --> 53:20.064
I GUESS WE WILL.

53:20.064 --> 53:21.432
( knock on door)

53:21.432 --> 53:24.835
HELLO, THERE.
WELCOME TO CAISLEáN CLOCHA.

53:24.835 --> 53:26.637
- HELLO, I'M AUDREY WOODS.
- I'M DANIEL RAFFERTY.

53:26.637 --> 53:28.606
- I'M REPRESENTING MR. JAMISON.
- I'M REPRESENTING MRS. JAMISON.

53:28.606 --> 53:30.408
I'M WONDERING
WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO SPEAK
TO THE STAFF FOR A MOMENT,

53:30.408 --> 53:32.142
- JUST A LITTLE BIT?
-...INTERVIEW THEM FOR A WHILE?

53:32.142 --> 53:35.246
AH, WOULD YOU BE
THE POSH LAWYERS
OVER FROM AMERICA, THEN?

53:35.246 --> 53:37.682
- Both: YES.
- THAT'S GRAND.

54:03.408 --> 54:06.677
- Rafferty: WELL, THEY ALL
AGREE WITH ME SO FAR.
- ME TOO.

54:12.850 --> 54:15.486
BRENDAN, I'M GOING TO NEED
TO INTERVIEW THE STAFF AGAIN.

54:15.486 --> 54:17.622
I'M NOT GETTING ANYWHERE.

54:17.622 --> 54:19.724
I'M AFRAID YOU'LL BE
OUT OF LUCK THERE, SIR, SURE.

54:19.724 --> 54:22.159
THEY'LL ALL BE DOWN
AT THE FESTIVAL.

54:22.159 --> 54:23.994
IT'S THE VILLAGE'S
ANNIVERSARY.

54:23.994 --> 54:28.333
IT CELEBRATES THE COUPLE
WHO FOUNDED THE PLACE
NEARLY 200 YEARS AGO.

54:28.333 --> 54:30.034
IT'S A LOVELY STORY.

54:30.034 --> 54:33.571
THEY WERE DEEPLY IN LOVE
BUT HER FATHER DIDN'T APPROVE,

54:33.571 --> 54:36.741
SO THEY RAN AWAY HERE
AND GOT MARRIED IN SECRET.

54:36.741 --> 54:39.610
AND EVERY YEAR
WE HAVE A FESTIVAL
IN THEIR HONOR.

54:39.610 --> 54:41.412
IT'S VERY ROMANTIC.

54:41.412 --> 54:44.349
- SINGING AND DANCING.
- AW, THAT'S NICE.

54:44.349 --> 54:48.686
SO BASICALLY, THE OLD FELLA
DIDN'T LIKE THIS SCOTTISH KNIGHT
NAILIN' HIS DAUGHTER,

54:48.686 --> 54:50.621
ET CETERA, ET CETERA,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

54:50.621 --> 54:54.659
SO BASICALLY, A LAME EXCUSE
FOR A THREE-DAY BOOZE UP.

55:01.031 --> 55:04.635
( Irish accent )
SO IS IT THE WILD WOMAN
OF THE BOGS HERSELF?

55:04.635 --> 55:07.137
I'D NEVER'VE
RECOGNIZED YA.

55:07.137 --> 55:09.340
AYE, YOU'RE CUTTIN'
A FINE FIGURE THIS EVENING,

55:09.340 --> 55:12.443
EVEN IF I DO
SAY SO ME-SELF.

55:12.443 --> 55:14.144
AND YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE--

55:14.144 --> 55:15.780
YOU'RE WEARING...

55:16.947 --> 55:18.015
THAT.

55:19.316 --> 55:21.386
- YOU DON'T LIKE IT?
- NO, NO, YOU GOT KIND OF A...

55:21.386 --> 55:25.456
"LENNY KRAVITZ MEETS KISS
WITHOUT THE MAKEUP" THING
GOING ON.

55:25.456 --> 55:28.258
NEVER TOO OLD
TO ROCK AND ROLL, HUH?

55:28.258 --> 55:31.328
( Irish folk music playing )

55:37.435 --> 55:39.504
( laughs )

55:44.409 --> 55:47.311
- ( band finishes song )
- ( cheering )

55:47.311 --> 55:49.380
( whistles )

55:57.755 --> 55:59.690
YOU HEARD THE STORY
OF THIS PLACE?

55:59.690 --> 56:02.593
YEAH, IT'S ALL LITTLE ELVES
AND LEPRECHAUNS FOR ME.

56:02.593 --> 56:06.597
- OH. WELL, I THOUGHT
IT WAS RATHER CHARMING.
- THERE YOU GO.

56:06.597 --> 56:09.400
- OH, WHAT'S THIS?
- OH, IT LOOKS LIKE POTEEN.

56:09.400 --> 56:11.235
- "POO" WHAT?
- IT'S NOT "POO."

56:11.235 --> 56:12.970
IT'S PUH, PUH--
"PUH-CHEEN."

56:12.970 --> 56:15.473
IT'S A TRADITIONAL IRISH DRINK,
SLIGHTLY ILLEGAL.

56:15.473 --> 56:18.208
- IT'S LIKE MOONSHINE.
- OH, SO THAT'S GAELIC
FOR "GOATS NUT."

56:18.208 --> 56:20.478
- Both: CHEERS.
- ( Irish folk music playing )

56:22.713 --> 56:25.282
AH! I WAS RIGHT.
IT IS POO.

56:25.282 --> 56:27.752
COULD I HAVE THE PLEASURE
OF THIS DANCE WITH YOU, MISS?

56:27.752 --> 56:29.887
- OH, YOU KNOW WHAT, I CAN'T--
- OH, SHE'D LOVE TO.

56:29.887 --> 56:31.456
- AND I'M WORKING.
- GO ON. GO ON.

56:31.456 --> 56:33.090
- I'M WORKING!
- YOU'LL SOON PICK IT UP.

56:33.090 --> 56:34.324
I'M WORKING HERE.

56:34.324 --> 56:35.860
NO!

56:35.860 --> 56:37.428
MAKE SURE TO KEEP
THOSE LEGS UP.

56:37.428 --> 56:39.897
( whistles )
WHOO!

56:49.507 --> 56:52.176
COME ON.
JUST COME ON.

56:52.176 --> 56:54.512
NO, NO, YOU GO.

57:01.686 --> 57:03.454
ARE YOU DANCING?

57:04.288 --> 57:05.456
( coughs )
NO, I'M NOT.

57:05.456 --> 57:06.891
NO, MADAM, I'M NOT.

57:06.891 --> 57:09.426
I'M SLIGHTLY INDISPOSED.
MY ANKLE AND STUFF LIKE THIS.

57:09.426 --> 57:10.928
- I'D LOVE TO, BUT--
- OH, DON'T BE SO SOFT.

57:10.928 --> 57:12.830
- NO!
- GET YOURSELF UP HERE.

57:16.567 --> 57:18.268
( song finishes )

57:19.369 --> 57:22.740
BEJESUS, YOU'RE A WHOLESOME
STRAP OF A WOMAN.

57:24.241 --> 57:25.943
ARE YOU MARRIED?

57:25.943 --> 57:28.479
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME
FOR A MOMENT?

57:30.414 --> 57:32.583
( groaning )

57:33.984 --> 57:35.786
HO-HO!

57:36.787 --> 57:39.657
I CAN'T LEAVE YOU ALONE
FOR A SECOND, CAN I?

57:39.657 --> 57:42.693
COME ON, HONEY, LET'S GO.
I'M SERIOUS THIS TIME.

57:42.693 --> 57:44.795
- I'M SORRY.
- LET'S GO.

57:45.663 --> 57:47.431
Man: GO!

57:47.431 --> 57:49.233
( crowd cheering )

57:55.506 --> 57:58.709
( all chanting )
GO! GO! GO! GO!

58:04.148 --> 58:06.717
YEAH!

58:06.717 --> 58:08.986
YEAH!

58:08.986 --> 58:11.121
( screaming )

58:11.121 --> 58:13.190
( coughing )

58:13.190 --> 58:14.959
( laughs )

58:14.959 --> 58:16.193
YEAH!

58:17.728 --> 58:19.964
OH, LOVELY.
LOVELY.

58:19.964 --> 58:22.166
FINE.
HERE YOU GO.

58:25.335 --> 58:26.737
THANKS!
ALL RIGHT!

58:26.737 --> 58:29.006
( rock music playing )

58:30.975 --> 58:33.443
- HERE YOU GO, A DRINK
FOR THE LITTLE GUY.
- YEAH!

58:33.443 --> 58:35.613
Announcer:
LADIES AND GENTLEMAN,
PLEASE TAKE YOUR PLACES

58:35.613 --> 58:36.981
AT THE WEDDING CIRCLE.

58:36.981 --> 58:41.385
THE VOWS YOU HAVE TAKEN
ARE HOLY AND BINDING.

58:41.385 --> 58:43.788
YOU'VE EXCHANGED RINGS

58:43.788 --> 58:46.857
AS A TOKEN
OF YOUR ETERNAL LOVE.

58:46.857 --> 58:51.696
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
MAN AND WIFE.

58:51.696 --> 58:53.598
YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE.

58:53.598 --> 58:56.533
All: AWW...

58:56.533 --> 58:58.135
Man:
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

59:09.980 --> 59:11.982
Mrs. Flanagan's voice:
IT'S A LOVELY STORY.

59:11.982 --> 59:14.451
THEY WERE DEEPLY IN LOVE,
SO THEY RAN AWAY HERE

59:14.451 --> 59:17.421
AND GOT MARRIED IN SECRET.
IT'S VERY ROMANTIC.

59:17.421 --> 59:22.226
Priest's voice:
THE VOWS YOU HAVE TAKEN
ARE HOLY AND BINDING.

59:22.226 --> 59:24.294
YOU'VE EXCHANGED RINGS

59:24.294 --> 59:27.632
AS A TOKEN
OF YOUR ETERNAL LOVE.

59:27.632 --> 59:31.568
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
MAN AND WIFE.

59:31.568 --> 59:34.038
YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE.

59:45.716 --> 59:47.785
( gasps )

59:47.785 --> 59:52.256
OH MY GOD.

59:52.256 --> 59:55.125
OH...

59:55.125 --> 59:56.927
MY...

59:56.927 --> 59:58.663
GOD.

59:58.663 --> 01:00:01.531
GOD.

01:00:01.531 --> 01:00:04.869
( groans )

01:00:11.575 --> 01:00:14.178
OH. AHHHH!

01:00:14.178 --> 01:00:15.780
OKAY, OKAY.
WAKE UP! WAKE UP!

01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.215
- OH, MORNING.
- WAKE UP!

01:00:18.215 --> 01:00:20.785
WOULD YOU PLEASE LOOK
AT YOUR LEFT HAND, PLEASE?

01:00:20.785 --> 01:00:22.853
- WHAT. OH.
- PLEASE!

01:00:24.989 --> 01:00:27.658
OH, WOULD YOU
LOOK AT THAT?

01:00:27.658 --> 01:00:30.560
OH, YOU GOT ONE TOO.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:32.262
( whimpers )

01:00:32.262 --> 01:00:34.832
DANIEL, DID WE
GET MARRIED LAST NIGHT?

01:00:34.832 --> 01:00:36.633
YES, I HAVE
A FEELING WE DID.

01:00:36.633 --> 01:00:38.602
- THE DETAILS ARE
A LITTLE BIT FUZZY,
- OH, OH...

01:00:38.602 --> 01:00:41.038
- BUT I THINK THE BRIDE
WAS SCINTILLATING...
- ( groaning )

01:00:41.038 --> 01:00:43.573
IN HER FIGURE-HUGGING
SERENA OUTFIT AND--

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:45.475
YOU'RE NOT HAPPY.

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:47.444
DO I LOOK HAPPY?!

01:00:47.444 --> 01:00:50.414
WELL, IT'S HARD TO SAY,
I MEAN, BECAUSE YOU NEVER
SEEM TO BE HAPPY AROUND ME

01:00:50.414 --> 01:00:51.982
AND I ALWAYS SEEM
TO MAKE YOU ANGRY AND--

01:00:51.982 --> 01:00:53.818
OH, OH, OH,
IT'S ALL COMING BACK.

01:00:53.818 --> 01:00:56.120
WE GOT TO FIND THE GUY
THAT DID THIS AND TELL HIM
WE DIDN'T MEAN IT.

01:00:56.120 --> 01:01:00.290
- WELL, WHAT IF I DID MEAN IT?
- OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T.
HOW COULD YOU?

01:01:00.290 --> 01:01:03.761
YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE MARRIED TO ME!

01:01:03.761 --> 01:01:07.464
MRS. FLANAGAN!
MRS. FLANAGAN!

01:01:07.464 --> 01:01:09.767
MRS. FLANAGAN!

01:01:09.767 --> 01:01:11.668
( distant )
OH, MRS. FLANAGAN!

01:01:11.668 --> 01:01:14.705
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?
- ANYBODY UP?!

01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:17.674
UGH, I STILL DON'T GET IT.
HOW CAN A WHOLE TOWN

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:20.610
BE OFF ON A THURSDAY
FOR NO APPARENT REASON?

01:01:20.610 --> 01:01:23.313
WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
TO FILE WHEN WE GET BACK
TO NEW YORK, OKAY?

01:01:23.313 --> 01:01:25.883
- IT'LL BE LIKE
IT NEVER HAPPENED.
- BUT IT DID HAPPEN.

01:01:25.883 --> 01:01:28.352
WHAT HAPPENED IS TIED
TO A MUCH LARGER ISSUE.

01:01:28.352 --> 01:01:30.554
LOT'S OF PEOPLE GET DRUNK
WITHOUT TYING THE KNOT.

01:01:30.554 --> 01:01:33.590
I MEAN, WHEN ONE'S INHIBITIONS
ARE DOWN, ONE ACTS ON ONE'S
TRUE FEELINGS.

01:01:33.590 --> 01:01:37.427
SANDERSON v. SANDERSON--
SUPREME COURT, ILLINOIS,
1993.

01:01:37.427 --> 01:01:39.730
YOU'RE CITING CASE LAWS
TO SUPPORT THIS INSANITY?

01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:42.833
WE GOT MARRIED
LAST NIGHT FOR GOODNESS SAKE.
THAT MEANS SOMETHING.

01:01:42.833 --> 01:01:46.036
YEAH, IT MEANS
THAT WE DRANK TOO MUCH
AND MADE A MISTAKE AGAIN.

01:01:46.036 --> 01:01:47.604
- OH, PHOOEY!
- Woman: HI.

01:01:47.604 --> 01:01:49.106
HI.
WE JUST GOT MARRIED.

01:01:49.106 --> 01:01:50.975
- CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANK YOU.

01:01:50.975 --> 01:01:52.910
- STOP TELLING PEOPLE.
- SHE'S THE FIRST ONE.

01:01:52.910 --> 01:01:55.445
YEAH, BUT THIS
KIND OF NEWS SPREADS.

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:57.181
I'LL COME BACK.

01:01:57.181 --> 01:01:58.983
HMM.

01:01:58.983 --> 01:02:00.951
- ( gasps ) OH MY GOD.
- WHAT?

01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:03.153
WE CAN'T BE MARRIED
AND BE OPPOSING COUNSELORS.

01:02:03.153 --> 01:02:05.255
WHY NOT?
CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

01:02:05.255 --> 01:02:07.624
- WE'LL LOOK RIDICULOUS.
AND NO YOU CANNOT.
- WHY NOT?

01:02:07.624 --> 01:02:09.626
WE'LL BE THE LAUGHING STOCK
OF THE NEW YORK BAR ASSOCIATION

01:02:09.626 --> 01:02:11.962
BECAUSE YOU WILL SAY SOMETHING
CONTRARY JUST TO BE CONTRARY.

01:02:11.962 --> 01:02:14.331
- ONLY THIS IS MY MARRIAGE TOO.
- YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN?

01:02:14.331 --> 01:02:16.300
OH, MY HEAD IS THUMPING.

01:02:17.868 --> 01:02:19.369
AHH! UGH!

01:02:21.872 --> 01:02:24.074
WILL YOU LOOK AT THAT?

01:02:24.074 --> 01:02:27.711
YOU JUST BROKE
THE LITTLE FELLA'S LEG
RIGHT OFF.

01:02:27.711 --> 01:02:29.780
HE'S LEGLESS.

01:02:31.515 --> 01:02:33.150
I LIKED THAT.

01:02:33.150 --> 01:02:36.787
I WAS GOING TO SAVE THAT
AS A SOUVENIR.

01:02:38.488 --> 01:02:40.257
HMM.

01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:45.095
I'M SORRY, DANIEL.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.475
Sara:
I'VE KNOWN YOU FOR 35 YEARS.

01:02:59.576 --> 01:03:02.212
ALCOHOL HAS A VERY
BAD EFFECT ON YOU.
YOU GET HYPER,

01:03:02.212 --> 01:03:03.981
YOU GET AGGRESSIVE,
YOU GET MARRIED.

01:03:03.981 --> 01:03:05.515
NO ONE AT THE OFFICE
CAN KNOW,

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:07.517
SO I HAVE TO RESEARCH
WHATEVER LEGAL SYSTEM

01:03:07.517 --> 01:03:09.086
COUNTY CLARE OPERATES UNDER.

01:03:09.086 --> 01:03:11.588
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU JUST
FILE HERE IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU WANT?

01:03:11.588 --> 01:03:13.057
OH, THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

01:03:13.057 --> 01:03:15.159
IT'LL TAKE THE PRESS
EXACTLY TWO SECONDS TO FIND OUT

01:03:15.159 --> 01:03:18.562
THAT I GOT DRUNK AND MARRIED
AND DIVORCED IN 24 HOURS.

01:03:18.562 --> 01:03:22.499
GIVEN MY VAST EXPERIENCE
WITH DIVORCE-- AND IT IS VAST--

01:03:22.499 --> 01:03:24.501
MY GUESS IS THAT THERE'S
A LOT OF WIGGLE ROOM.

01:03:24.501 --> 01:03:27.071
HELL, YOU COULD
PROBABLY GET IT ANNULLED
AS LONG AS YOU DIDN'T...

01:03:28.372 --> 01:03:30.507
( chuckles )
NEVER MIND.

01:03:30.507 --> 01:03:33.911
- I HAVE TO START WIGGLING
FIRST THING IN THE MORNING.
- MM-HMM.

01:03:35.679 --> 01:03:37.547
MOTHER, WHAT IS THIS?

01:03:37.547 --> 01:03:40.050
OH, THE GIRLS AND I
ARE HAVING A LIP PARTY LATER.

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:42.152
YOU CAN JOIN US
IF YOU LIKE.

01:03:42.152 --> 01:03:45.322
DAVID TAKES FAT OUT OF OUR BUTTS
AND INJECTS IT INTO OUR LIPS.

01:03:45.322 --> 01:03:48.592
THAT GIVES A WHOLE NEW MEANING
TO "TALKING OUTTA YOUR ASS."

01:03:48.592 --> 01:03:52.096
( phone ringing )

01:03:55.732 --> 01:03:57.234
HELLO?

01:03:57.234 --> 01:03:58.802
Sara:
Better pick up
the New York Post

01:03:58.802 --> 01:04:02.606
- before you file
for divorce. Page 6.
- WHAT?!

01:04:12.516 --> 01:04:14.284
OFF TO GET ONE OF THESE?

01:04:16.620 --> 01:04:18.956
WHY DID YOU TELL THEM THIS?
ARE YOU CRAZY?

01:04:18.956 --> 01:04:20.557
YOU THINK I DID THAT?

01:04:20.557 --> 01:04:23.660
WHY WOULD I DO THAT,
WHEN YOU MADE IT
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR

01:04:23.660 --> 01:04:27.264
THAT BEING MARRIED WAS
THE LAST THING YOU WANTED
TO BE, ESPECIALLY TO ME?

01:04:28.098 --> 01:04:29.866
- CAN I?
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.902
I'M CALLING
THE POST TO TELL THEM
THEY MADE A MISTAKE.

01:04:31.902 --> 01:04:34.671
- DANIEL--
- OR THAT WE MADE A MISTAKE.
WHICH SHOULD I SAY?

01:04:34.671 --> 01:04:36.340
NO, NO, NO,
PUT-- PUT THE--

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:38.909
PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE,
PUT THE PHONE DOWN. I--

01:04:38.909 --> 01:04:40.610
I'M N--

01:04:40.610 --> 01:04:43.313
I'M NOT TRYING
TO BE HURTFUL HERE.

01:04:43.313 --> 01:04:45.782
JUST BEAR WITH ME
FOR A MINUTE, OKAY?

01:04:45.782 --> 01:04:47.884
- TRUST ME.
- MM-HMM.

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:50.887
IN THE WAY
THAT YOU TRUST ME?

01:04:51.956 --> 01:04:53.523
OKAY, LISTEN.

01:04:53.523 --> 01:04:55.359
WE GOT MARRIED
WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT.

01:04:55.359 --> 01:04:58.528
AND IT SEEMS THAT
IT WAS, IF NOTHING ELSE,
A LITTLE IMPULSIVE.

01:04:58.528 --> 01:05:00.430
PERSONALLY, I BLAME
THE "POO" DRINK.

01:05:00.430 --> 01:05:03.968
NOW WE'RE BACK IN NEW YORK,
AND ON OPPOSITE SIDES
OF A MAJOR CASE,

01:05:03.968 --> 01:05:07.671
SO WHATEVER WE MAY
OR MAY NOT DO IN THE FUTURE
IN THE SHORT TERM--

01:05:07.671 --> 01:05:09.139
- I AGREE.
- WHAT?

01:05:09.139 --> 01:05:11.241
I AGREE.
IT'S THE ONLY THING
WE CAN DO...

01:05:11.241 --> 01:05:12.542
IN THE SHORT TERM.

01:05:12.542 --> 01:05:14.278
I HAVEN'T SAID
WHAT I WAS GOING TO SAY.

01:05:14.278 --> 01:05:16.113
YOU WERE GOING TO SAY
THAT WE HAVE TO APPEAR MARRIED

01:05:16.113 --> 01:05:18.015
OR WE WILL SERIOUSLY
SCREW UP OUR CAREERS.

01:05:18.015 --> 01:05:22.519
SO... THAT ONLY LEAVES
ONE QUESTION, DOESN'T IT?

01:05:25.122 --> 01:05:28.392
FORGIVE ME IF I GET EMOTIONAL,
BUT THIS IS THE DAY EVERY MOTHER
DREAMS OF--

01:05:28.392 --> 01:05:30.260
THE DAY SHE GETS TO WATCH
HER ONLY DAUGHTER

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:33.563
PUT A LOCK
ON THE BEDROOM DOOR
TO KEEP HER HUSBAND OUT.

01:05:33.563 --> 01:05:34.798
OH, STOP IT, MOTHER.

01:05:34.798 --> 01:05:37.001
IT MAY HAVE BEEN A WEDDING,
BUT IT IS NOT A MARRIAGE.

01:05:37.001 --> 01:05:39.036
- ( doorbell rings )
- ( scoffs )

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.976
HI, I'M THE HUSBAND.

01:05:45.976 --> 01:05:48.112
HI, I'M THE MOTHER.

01:05:48.112 --> 01:05:51.315
- OH.
- MMM?

01:05:55.119 --> 01:05:57.021
Audrey:
UH, THIS IS YOUR ROOM.

01:05:57.021 --> 01:05:58.588
I MADE SOME ROOM
IN THE CLOSET

01:05:58.588 --> 01:06:00.924
EVEN THOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE
YOU NEVER HANG ANYTHING UP.

01:06:00.924 --> 01:06:01.992
HMM.

01:06:01.992 --> 01:06:03.994
BATHROOM'S
THROUGH THERE.

01:06:03.994 --> 01:06:06.430
OH, SHE'S BACK
TO HER OLD SELF.
THAT SEEMS PROMISING.

01:06:06.430 --> 01:06:08.198
I TOLD YOU DARLING,
WE DON'T NEED SEPARATE BEDROOMS.

01:06:08.198 --> 01:06:10.500
I DON'T MIND YOU SNORING.
CAN I USE THE KITCHEN?

01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:13.237
HE COOKS. YOU NEVER
TOLD ME HE COOKS.

01:06:16.206 --> 01:06:18.175
YES, WELL, IT'S BEEN
A STRANGE COUPLE OF DAYS.

01:06:18.175 --> 01:06:19.743
I'M SURE SHE'LL COME AROUND,
DON'T WORRY.

01:06:19.743 --> 01:06:22.746
- SHOULDN'T I
BE SAYING THAT TO YOU?
- ( both chuckle )

01:06:22.746 --> 01:06:26.350
YES, OH, I'VE ENJOYED
READING ABOUT YOU IN
THE SOCIETY PAGES.

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:28.885
ARE YOU, UH, REALLY 56?

01:06:28.885 --> 01:06:30.920
- PARTS OF ME ARE.
- AH.

01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:32.789
- WOULD YOU
LIKE A COCKTAIL?
- OH, YES, PLEASE.

01:06:32.789 --> 01:06:34.791
- MMM.
- ONLY IF IT'S
AN EXTREMELY LARGE ONE.

01:06:34.791 --> 01:06:35.992
OKAY.

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:58.014
( sniffs )
I MADE BROWNIES.

01:06:59.083 --> 01:07:02.652
I'VE GIVEN UP SUGAR.
IT WAS A CRUTCH.

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:11.027
( sighs )

01:07:14.431 --> 01:07:16.933
- WHAT?
- IS THAT WHAT
YOU'RE WEARING?

01:07:16.933 --> 01:07:19.336
- WHAT'S
THE MATTER WITH IT?
- NOTHING, NOTHING.

01:07:19.336 --> 01:07:23.573
IT-- IT JUST NEEDS...

01:07:23.573 --> 01:07:25.742
SOMETHING.

01:07:35.152 --> 01:07:36.853
WE'RE MARRIED, REMEMBER?

01:07:36.853 --> 01:07:39.656
WE HAVE TO MAKE IT LOOK
LIKE WE MEAN IT...

01:07:39.656 --> 01:07:41.391
EVEN IF WE DON'T.

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:47.564
LET ME.

01:08:02.746 --> 01:08:05.615
WELL, SAY SOMETHING.

01:08:07.217 --> 01:08:09.085
UH...

01:08:09.085 --> 01:08:10.754
UM...

01:08:12.222 --> 01:08:14.624
DID YOU GET
YOURSELF ONE TOO?

01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:26.236
- YOU WANT ME
TO DO IT OR YOU?
- UH-- EH-- I CAN DO IT.

01:08:38.715 --> 01:08:42.519
THERE, NOW WE
CAN FOOL ANYONE, EH?

01:08:43.653 --> 01:08:45.854
I GUESS.

01:08:47.890 --> 01:08:51.027
-( screaming, yelling )
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!
QUIET BACK THERE!

01:08:52.328 --> 01:08:54.464
( repeating )
I CAN'T HEAR YOU!
I CAN'T HEAR YOU!

01:08:54.464 --> 01:08:56.633
Thorne:
YOU PUSSY!

01:09:02.706 --> 01:09:04.908
- HERE YOU GO.
- OH, THANKS.

01:09:04.908 --> 01:09:06.443
YOU'RE WELCOME.

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:10.613
Serena:
JUST SHUT UP. WHY CAN'T
YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN?

01:09:10.613 --> 01:09:12.549
Thorne:
WHY CAN'T YOU FALL
UNDER A SNOWPLOW?

01:09:12.549 --> 01:09:14.417
- Serena: IT'S SUMMER.
- ( Thorne chuckles )

01:09:14.417 --> 01:09:17.487
Thorne: YEAH, I'LL
BUY YOU ONE AS A PARTING GIFT.

01:09:19.022 --> 01:09:21.691
- ( Audrey laughs )
-...SO I LOOKED LIKE 12.

01:09:27.831 --> 01:09:29.366
OH, YOUR MOTHER
CALLED EARLIER.

01:09:29.366 --> 01:09:31.968
HEY, I RAN INTO
TRACEY ABRAMOVITZ TODAY.

01:09:31.968 --> 01:09:33.870
OH, TRACEY, TRACEY.

01:09:48.685 --> 01:09:50.953
FOUR MILLION?

01:09:50.953 --> 01:09:53.557
ASPEN?

01:09:53.557 --> 01:09:55.559
JEEZ.

01:09:57.026 --> 01:09:59.863
Announcer on TV:
...it looks like it
is going to cut

01:09:59.863 --> 01:10:02.299
its way through
the Mid-Atlantic states.

01:10:02.299 --> 01:10:05.535
So later on in the day--
New York and also around,
say, the Stanton area--

01:10:05.535 --> 01:10:08.204
you may see an isolated shower
or thunderstorm.

01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:13.577
...still soggy
across New England,

01:10:13.577 --> 01:10:16.079
otherwise
high pressure settles
into the Mid-Atlantic coast

01:10:16.079 --> 01:10:17.947
and it'll be dry
in the morning tomorrow.

01:10:17.947 --> 01:10:20.350
New York's shore forecast
for today, 75...

01:10:58.555 --> 01:11:00.590
( glass clinks )

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:14.170
HMM.

01:11:14.170 --> 01:11:17.474
Rafferty:
AND NOT ONLY DID SERENA
RENOVATE AND DECORATE--

01:11:17.474 --> 01:11:21.411
YES, INDEED,
SAVE CAISLEáN CLOCHA--

01:11:21.411 --> 01:11:24.514
SHE RESTORED THE GARDENS.
SHE REACHED OUT INTO
THE COMMUNITY,

01:11:24.514 --> 01:11:29.453
SINGLE-HANDEDLY REVIVING
THE ANCIENT TEXTILE INDUSTRY
IN THE AREA,

01:11:29.453 --> 01:11:31.988
PUMPING REVENUE
BACK INTO THE ECONOMY.

01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:34.424
YEAH, SHE WAS PUMPING
THE GARDENER AS WELL.

01:11:34.424 --> 01:11:36.826
- ( audience yells )
- SHOVE IT!

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:39.262
MS. WOODS, IF YOU DON'T
PUT A MUZZLE ON HIM...

01:11:39.262 --> 01:11:41.665
YOUR HONOR, MY CLIENT
IS SIMPLY MAKING THE POINT

01:11:41.665 --> 01:11:44.934
THAT WHILE HE WAS AWAY WORKING
HARD TO PAY FOR THE CASTLE,

01:11:44.934 --> 01:11:47.971
HIS WIFE'S ACTIVITIES MAY NOT
HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY ALTRUISTIC.

01:11:47.971 --> 01:11:50.974
IF FIDELITY IS
AT ISSUE HERE, WE CAN
HAPPILY PRODUCE RECEIPTS

01:11:50.974 --> 01:11:53.843
DOCUMENTING
MR. JAMISON'S TOUR
OF THE WORLD'S BROTHELS.

01:11:53.843 --> 01:11:56.713
- ( audience cheering )
- YEAH!

01:11:57.681 --> 01:12:00.350
- NICE.
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT!

01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:02.886
- QUIET BACK THERE!
- AHH!

01:12:02.886 --> 01:12:04.388
WHAT IS THE RELEVANCE
OF THIS?

01:12:04.388 --> 01:12:06.089
I'M SUGGESTING
THAT MRS. JAMISON

01:12:06.089 --> 01:12:08.825
DOESN'T DESERVE TO BE
AWARDED A $3 MILLION CASTLE

01:12:08.825 --> 01:12:11.795
SIMPLY BECAUSE
SHE HUNG SOME CURTAINS
AND WAS POPULAR WITH THE HELP.

01:12:11.795 --> 01:12:13.997
WHY NOT?
SHE SHOULDN'T BE DENIED
HER STANDARD OF LIVING,

01:12:13.997 --> 01:12:16.533
ESPECIALLY WHEN
HER HUSBAND OVER THERE
FORKED OUT FOUR MILLION

01:12:16.533 --> 01:12:18.668
ON A LOVE SHACK
FOR HIS MISTRESS IN ASPEN.

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:20.704
( woman gasps )

01:12:26.142 --> 01:12:28.645
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT?

01:12:29.913 --> 01:12:31.681
I...

01:12:32.549 --> 01:12:35.184
I SAID DON'T
TELL NO ONE ABOUT ASPEN!

01:12:35.184 --> 01:12:37.487
WHAT ABOUT ALL THAT
LAWYER-CLIENT CRAP?!

01:12:37.487 --> 01:12:40.424
Abramovitz:
I WILL NOT STAND FOR THIS
BEHAVIOR IN THE COURTROOM.

01:12:40.424 --> 01:12:41.958
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO SKI!

01:12:41.958 --> 01:12:44.327
SHUT IT.

01:12:44.327 --> 01:12:46.963
( cheering )

01:12:55.605 --> 01:12:58.508
I WANT A DIVORCE.

01:13:16.693 --> 01:13:18.895
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

01:13:18.895 --> 01:13:20.129
I SWEAR.

01:13:20.129 --> 01:13:22.265
I WAS TAKING OUT THE GARBAGE,
THE BAG BROKE...

01:13:22.265 --> 01:13:24.901
-...AND THEN IN
THE MIDDLE OF THE BATTLE--
- I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

01:13:27.336 --> 01:13:30.073
SO...

01:13:30.073 --> 01:13:32.075
YOU WANT A DIVORCE?

01:13:32.075 --> 01:13:33.477
YES.

01:13:33.477 --> 01:13:35.745
SO ONE LITTLE HICCUP
AND WE GIVE IN, EH?

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:37.213
JUST LIKE ALL THE SAPS
WE REPRESENT?

01:13:37.213 --> 01:13:39.348
DO NOT THROW YOUR TAKE
ON LIFE AND MARRIAGE AT ME

01:13:39.348 --> 01:13:41.417
LIKE SOME
MORAL BATTERING RAM.

01:13:41.417 --> 01:13:45.889
AND WHAT ABOUT
THE PROFESSIONAL FALLOUT
YOU SEEM SO DESPERATE TO AVOID?

01:13:49.025 --> 01:13:51.360
WELL...

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.162
I'M SORRY,
I DON'T BELIEVE IN DIVORCE.

01:13:53.162 --> 01:13:55.364
YOU DON'T BELIEVE IN DIVORCE?
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

01:13:55.364 --> 01:13:58.234
- YOU MAKE YOUR LIVING--
- IT'S A JOB!

01:13:59.168 --> 01:14:01.538
BUT IN THOSE MISERABLE COUPLES,
WHAT DO WHAT WE SEE?

01:14:01.538 --> 01:14:03.573
- WHAT DO WE REALLY SEE?
- US. WE SEE US!

01:14:03.573 --> 01:14:06.075
- PEOPLE WHO HAVE MADE
A HUGE MISTAKE--
- NO, NO, NO, NO!

01:14:06.075 --> 01:14:07.911
WE SEE PEOPLE
WHO ARE NOT WILLING TO FIGHT.

01:14:07.911 --> 01:14:09.613
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT
FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN.

01:14:09.613 --> 01:14:11.147
FIGHT FAIR, FIGHT DIRTY,
BUT FIGHT!

01:14:11.147 --> 01:14:12.649
PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED
TO FIGHT TO SAVE A MARRIAGE

01:14:12.649 --> 01:14:14.417
HAVE TO BE IN A MARRIAGE
THEY WANT TO BE IN!

01:14:14.417 --> 01:14:15.752
- I AM!
- THAT'S BULLSHIT!

01:14:15.752 --> 01:14:17.521
NO, IT ISN'T!
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

01:14:17.521 --> 01:14:19.122
I'M NOT IN THIS MARRIAGE
TO SAVE MY CAREER,

01:14:19.122 --> 01:14:22.926
I'M SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU,
BUT I DON'T CARE ABOUT
MY CAREER!

01:14:25.562 --> 01:14:27.631
BUT I DO CARE
ABOUT YOU...

01:14:29.966 --> 01:14:32.435
AND SO I WILL GIVE YOU
A DIVORCE, GLADLY,

01:14:32.435 --> 01:14:36.005
BECAUSE...
CALL ME OLD FASHIONED,

01:14:36.005 --> 01:14:38.007
BUT WHEN YOU
LOVE SOMEONE...

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:40.977
I BELIEVE YOU
SHOULD BE UNSELFISH ENOUGH

01:14:40.977 --> 01:14:43.212
TO GIVE THEM
WHATEVER THEY WANT.

01:14:48.652 --> 01:14:51.254
I'LL BE AROUND LATER
TO PICK UP MY THINGS.

01:15:43.973 --> 01:15:47.010
- ( dialing )
- Sara: HELLO?

01:15:47.010 --> 01:15:48.778
MOM?

01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:04.160
( phone rings )

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:07.196
- Sara: Hello?
- Woman: Hi, Sara, it's Arlene.

01:16:07.196 --> 01:16:10.166
Sara:
Arlene, can I call you back?
I have Audrey with me.

01:16:15.939 --> 01:16:18.541
Sara:
DARLING, YOU CAN'T
LIVE YOUR LIFE

01:16:18.541 --> 01:16:20.644
TRYING TO AVOID
THE MISTAKES I'VE MADE.

01:16:20.644 --> 01:16:22.746
YOU'VE GOT
TO MAKE YOUR OWN.

01:16:22.746 --> 01:16:24.848
YOU THINK
I'M MAKING ONE?

01:16:24.848 --> 01:16:27.016
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO TELL YOU, HONEY.

01:16:27.016 --> 01:16:29.786
ALL I KNOW IS THAT I'M
RUNNING OUT OF FAVORS.

01:16:29.786 --> 01:16:31.921
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
HOW HARD IT IS

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:35.859
TO PLACE AN ITEM ON PAGE SIX
OF THE NEW YORK POST?

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:41.931
- ( laughs )
- OH.

01:16:41.931 --> 01:16:44.333
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

01:16:50.606 --> 01:16:52.876
Abramovitz:
I HAD THORNE JAMISON'S

01:16:52.876 --> 01:16:55.044
12-YEAR-OLD ASSISTANT
ON THE PHONE THIS MORNING.

01:16:55.044 --> 01:16:58.047
DON'T ASK ME HOW SHE GOT
MY PRIVATE LINE-- IT'S UNLISTED.

01:16:58.047 --> 01:17:02.986
ANYWAY, SHE HAS INFORMED ME
THAT YOUR CLIENT WILL NOT BE
APPEARING IN COURT TODAY,

01:17:02.986 --> 01:17:05.354
AS HE HAS GONE BACK
TO HIS CASTLE IN IRELAND.

01:17:05.354 --> 01:17:08.124
WHICH AS YOU KNOW HAS
NOT YET BEEN AWARDED
TO EITHER PARTY

01:17:08.124 --> 01:17:09.926
AND IS, AS SUCH,
OFF LIMITS.

01:17:09.926 --> 01:17:12.495
NOW I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
48 HOURS TO GET HIM BACK HERE

01:17:12.495 --> 01:17:15.699
OR I'M GOING
TO DISMISS THIS CASE
FOR FAILURE TO PROSECUTE.

01:17:17.133 --> 01:17:19.102
ARE YOU OKAY?

01:17:19.102 --> 01:17:21.971
I'M FINE.

01:17:32.281 --> 01:17:35.351
- OH, WELCOME BACK.
- HELLO, MRS. FLANAGAN.

01:17:35.351 --> 01:17:37.153
- IS MR. JAMISON IN?
- ( distant screaming )

01:17:37.153 --> 01:17:39.388
- Woman: OH MY GOD!
- OH, NO.

01:17:39.388 --> 01:17:41.657
( screaming continues )

01:17:46.796 --> 01:17:48.297
OH MY GOD!
ARE YOU-- OH!

01:17:48.297 --> 01:17:50.099
- Woman: GET OFF OF ME!
- OH, I UH...

01:17:50.099 --> 01:17:52.368
I-I'M SO SORRY.
I THOUGHT Y-YOU--

01:17:52.368 --> 01:17:54.003
YOU SCREAMED.

01:17:54.003 --> 01:17:55.972
- YEAH, DON'T YOU?
- ( both laughing )

01:17:55.972 --> 01:17:57.874
Thorne:
NICE ONE, BABE.

01:17:57.874 --> 01:17:59.375
YEAH, NO-- WELL--

01:17:59.375 --> 01:18:02.545
SEE, UH, WE-- WE BOTH
GOT HERE ON SEPARATE PLANES

01:18:02.545 --> 01:18:06.682
AND, UH, WE WERE JUST ABOUT
TO GET STUCK INTO TEARING
THE PLACE APART

01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:10.386
WHEN MRS. F COMES IN
AND SAYS, "HAPPY ANNIVERSARY."

01:18:10.386 --> 01:18:12.155
SEVEN YEARS.

01:18:12.155 --> 01:18:14.357
YOU WAS JUST A BABY,
WEREN'T YOU?

01:18:14.357 --> 01:18:18.161
SEE, WE GOT MARRIED HERE
IN THE LOCAL VILLAGE.

01:18:18.161 --> 01:18:20.029
ANYWAY, WE DECIDED
TO MAKE IT WORK.

01:18:20.029 --> 01:18:21.430
- YOU KNOW, WHATEVER, RIGHT?
- YEAH

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:23.366
- YOU CAN'T GIVE UP, RIGHT?
- NO.

01:18:23.366 --> 01:18:25.334
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

01:18:29.638 --> 01:18:31.908
- AUDREY.
- HELLO.

01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:36.712
WHAT ARE YOU BOTH
DOING HERE, ANYWAY?

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:41.517
I CAME TO TELL YOU
YOU'RE NOT LEGALLY
ALLOWED TO BE HERE.

01:18:41.517 --> 01:18:43.086
YEAH, BUT WE ARE.

01:18:43.086 --> 01:18:45.154
YEAH, 'CAUSE LIKE
WE OWN IT.

01:18:45.154 --> 01:18:47.623
BUT, UH, YOU KNOW, THANKS
FOR COMING ALL THIS WAY.

01:18:47.623 --> 01:18:51.327
MICHAEL!
YOU MUST BOTH
STAY FOR SOME NOSH.

01:18:52.929 --> 01:18:54.530
YES, SIR?

01:18:54.530 --> 01:18:56.933
AH, HELLO THERE.
IF IT ISN'T THEMSELVES.

01:18:56.933 --> 01:18:58.334
HOW ARE YOU?

01:18:58.334 --> 01:19:01.470
AH, MICHAEL,HU, WILL YOU TELL
MRS. FLANAGAN

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:04.107
THAT WE WILL BE
TWO EXTRA FOR DIN-DINS?

01:19:04.107 --> 01:19:07.844
- NO PROBLEM, SIR.
- SO YOU WORK HERE AS WELL?

01:19:08.945 --> 01:19:10.313
AS WELL AS WHAT?

01:19:10.313 --> 01:19:11.915
BEING A PRIEST.

01:19:12.748 --> 01:19:14.717
OH, I SEE!
( laughs )

01:19:14.717 --> 01:19:16.452
YEAH,
THE OLD FESTIVAL.

01:19:16.452 --> 01:19:19.555
AH, NO, I JUST DO THAT
FOR A BIT OF FUN.

01:19:19.555 --> 01:19:22.792
I HAVE AN ECCLESIASTICAL
DEMEANOR APPARENTLY.

01:19:22.792 --> 01:19:25.394
SO...

01:19:25.394 --> 01:19:27.430
YOU'RE NOT A REAL PRIEST?

01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:29.498
OH, GOODNESS ME, NO.

01:19:29.498 --> 01:19:33.302
STILL, I SEE YOU WENT AHEAD
AND DID IT FOR REAL.

01:19:33.302 --> 01:19:36.605
I CAN ALWAYS TELL
THE ONES WHO WILL.

01:19:36.605 --> 01:19:38.975
CONGRATULATIONS.

01:19:40.643 --> 01:19:42.211
SO...

01:19:43.446 --> 01:19:45.915
- SO THAT MEANS THEN...
- OH, NO! OH, GOD.

01:19:49.752 --> 01:19:51.821
WELL...

01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:56.492
THE LAST THING ANYONE
IN THIS ROOM SEEMS TO NEED

01:19:56.492 --> 01:19:59.362
IS A DIVORCE ATTORNEY.

01:20:02.531 --> 01:20:05.401
I WON'T STAY FOR SUPPER,
IF IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU.

01:20:11.740 --> 01:20:13.542
EXCUSE ME.

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:22.986
( clears throat )
WELL, AH--

01:20:22.986 --> 01:20:24.520
AH, THANKS.

01:20:24.520 --> 01:20:26.789
ANYWAY, UH...

01:20:26.789 --> 01:20:28.557
BOTH OF YOU
HAVE BEEN GREAT.

01:20:28.557 --> 01:20:30.393
I-I-I HAD NO IDEA

01:20:30.393 --> 01:20:32.595
- THE LEGAL SYSTEM WAS SO DEEP.
- ( car departs )

01:20:32.595 --> 01:20:33.729
ARE YOU OKAY?

01:20:33.729 --> 01:20:36.365
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

01:20:36.365 --> 01:20:38.902
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

01:20:38.902 --> 01:20:41.971
I THINK YOU TWO HAVE
HAD A LOVER'S TIFF.

01:20:42.906 --> 01:20:45.774
YEAH--
YEAH, WE DID, KINDA.

01:20:45.774 --> 01:20:47.776
Serena:
YEAH, WELL,
YOU GOTTA GET OVER IT.

01:20:47.776 --> 01:20:51.014
YOU KNOW, YOU WERE
THE ONE WHO SAID YOU COULD
GET THROUGH THE BAD PATCHES,

01:20:51.014 --> 01:20:53.016
THAT BREAKING UP
WAS THE LAST RESORT.

01:20:53.016 --> 01:20:55.919
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

01:20:57.520 --> 01:20:59.188
YES, I DID.

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:03.859
WILL YOU GIVE ME A RIDE?

01:21:08.965 --> 01:21:11.167
- Serena: DO YOU KNOW THE WAY?
- Thorne: DO I KNOW THE WAY?

01:21:11.167 --> 01:21:14.303
- I KNOW IRELAND LIKE
THE BACK OF MY HAND.
- Serena: YEAH, RIGHT.

01:21:14.303 --> 01:21:17.106
Thorne:
ALONG GIANT'S PASS,

01:21:17.106 --> 01:21:20.576
THROUGH PADDY'S CROSS,

01:21:20.576 --> 01:21:22.979
OVER THE BRIDGE,

01:21:22.979 --> 01:21:24.981
AND BACK
TO PADDY'S CROSS.

01:21:24.981 --> 01:21:26.715
Serena:
WE'RE LOST.

01:21:26.715 --> 01:21:28.684
Thorne:
NO, NO, NO, NO, I SHOULD HAVE
TURNED RIGHT EARLIER.

01:21:28.684 --> 01:21:31.620
AH, RIGHT,
I'M ALL OVER IT.
WHAT TIME'S YOUR FLIGHT?

01:21:38.694 --> 01:21:41.897
HI. DID THE FLIGHT
FOR NEW YORK LEAVE YET?

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.501
TWO MINUTES AGO.

01:21:45.501 --> 01:21:46.869
DID DANIEL RAFFERTY
CHECK IN?

01:21:46.869 --> 01:21:48.337
I'M SORRY,
WE'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GIVE--

01:21:48.337 --> 01:21:50.073
PLEASE, PLEASE,
CAN YOU JUST BE THE GUY

01:21:50.073 --> 01:21:52.475
WHO BREAKS THE RULES,
JUST THIS ONCE?

01:21:53.642 --> 01:21:55.945
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.

01:21:57.280 --> 01:21:59.582
- RAFFERTY, YOU SAY?
- YEAH.

01:21:59.582 --> 01:22:01.217
( typing )

01:22:02.451 --> 01:22:05.454
YES, HE DID.
WERE YOU MEANT
TO BE WITH HIM?

01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:10.226
YES, I WAS.

01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:13.396
WHEN'S THE NEXT FLIGHT
TO NEW YORK?

01:22:16.599 --> 01:22:19.602
( chattering )

01:22:33.616 --> 01:22:35.918
Audrey:
DID YOU KNOW
THAT 80% OF WOMEN

01:22:35.918 --> 01:22:40.223
WHO SAY THEY'RE TOO BUSY
TO HAVE A RELATIONSHIP,
ARE REALLY LONELY?

01:22:44.127 --> 01:22:46.095
AND ARE YOU?

01:22:47.596 --> 01:22:50.133
I WAS.

01:22:51.334 --> 01:22:53.536
YOU'RE ALWAYS SAYING
THAT YOU HAVE TO FIGHT

01:22:53.536 --> 01:22:58.041
TO SAVE A MARRIAGE
AND NOT GIVE IN, RIGHT?

01:23:00.009 --> 01:23:02.378
YES.

01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:06.549
DO YOU REALLY
BELIEVE THAT?

01:23:09.052 --> 01:23:11.187
YES, I DO...

01:23:12.588 --> 01:23:14.157
VERY MUCH.

01:23:15.724 --> 01:23:17.760
WHY?

01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.662
WELL...

01:23:22.665 --> 01:23:24.367
DO YOU WANT TO FIGHT?

01:23:25.734 --> 01:23:28.104
Abramovitz:
NOT ONLY DO I HAVE TO PUT UP
WITH YOUR BICKERING,

01:23:28.104 --> 01:23:30.939
FINGER POINTING, BACKSTABBING
AND NAME CALLING
DURING THE WEEK,

01:23:30.939 --> 01:23:32.708
NOW YOU DRAG ME IN
ON THE WEEKEND TOO?!

01:23:34.243 --> 01:23:36.279
ANYWAY, SEEING AS
WE'RE HERE,

01:23:36.279 --> 01:23:40.849
COUNSELOR WOODS,
I'D LIKE TO ASK YOU
A QUESTION, IF I MAY.

01:23:42.118 --> 01:23:44.620
DO YOU TAKE THIS MAN TO BE
YOUR LAWFULLY WEDDED HUSBAND?

01:23:44.620 --> 01:23:47.356
WILL YOU LOVE HIM,
KEEP HIM,

01:23:47.356 --> 01:23:49.558
HONOR HIM
AND PROTECT HIM,

01:23:49.558 --> 01:23:53.796
AND FORSAKING ALL OTHERS,
BE LOYAL ONLY TO HIM?

01:23:58.067 --> 01:24:00.103
- I WILL.
- I KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

01:24:01.870 --> 01:24:03.739
I'M HER MOTHER.

01:24:07.110 --> 01:24:08.844
I WILL.

01:24:08.844 --> 01:24:10.546
SO WILL I.

01:24:10.546 --> 01:24:12.915
Abramovitz:
HEY! HEY! I DIDN'T
GET TO YOU YET.

01:24:12.915 --> 01:24:15.050
- SORRY.
- WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU PEOPLE?

01:24:15.050 --> 01:24:18.121
DO YOU WANT TO BE THE ONLY MAN
EVER HELD IN CONTEMPT
AT HIS OWN WEDDING?

01:24:18.121 --> 01:24:19.722
NO, YOUR HONOR.

01:24:22.225 --> 01:24:23.926
COUNSELOR
DANIEL RAFFERTY,

01:24:23.926 --> 01:24:26.962
DO YOU TAKE THIS WOMAN TO BE
YOUR LAWFULLY WEDDED WIFE?

01:24:26.962 --> 01:24:28.631
WILL YOU LOVE HER...

01:24:28.631 --> 01:24:30.866
WITH THE POWER INVESTED IN ME
BY THE STATE OF NEW YORK,

01:24:30.866 --> 01:24:35.138
I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU
HUSBAND AND WIFE.

01:24:35.138 --> 01:24:37.473
YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE.

01:24:56.692 --> 01:24:58.427
BYE.
( sighs )

01:24:58.427 --> 01:25:00.563
HERE YOU GO,
FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE.

01:25:00.563 --> 01:25:03.432
OH, WOW.
HOW CAN I REFUSE?

01:25:03.432 --> 01:25:05.201
- ( laughs )
- MMM.

01:25:05.201 --> 01:25:07.336
Man:
YOU KNOW, YOU FOLKS
MAY WANT TO CLOSE THE SUNROOF.

01:25:07.336 --> 01:25:11.274
THERE'S A 79% CHANCE OF RAIN
IN THE NEXT HALF HOUR.

01:25:12.074 --> 01:25:13.642
