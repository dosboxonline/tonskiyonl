25:23.189 --> 25:25.558
There was the Arab/Israeli War.

25:25.692 --> 25:28.526
And we could certainly see
that the Arab view

25:35.401 --> 25:37.737
I am about done
with looking north of I-20.

25:37.837 --> 25:41.107
I sunk three wells last week.
I didn't even hit water.

25:41.207 --> 25:43.209
It's because there ain't
any water north of I-20.

- Stonewall.

gonna do with three wells?

and in exchange for that,

33:50.062 --> 33:52.697
we pay you $2 and a half
million dollars a year.

33:52.698 --> 33:56.268

and dig your stock tanks.

into thinking you're a rancher.

the money we give you on cattle.

that ranch in the '50s.

$200,000 checks every month.

that I offend you.
