01:28.375 --> 01:32.208
I wish she'd never boarded that plane.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.708
They were alone. They had nothing.

01:41.458 --> 01:43.166
The baby girl, what is she eating?

01:43.666 --> 01:45.083
What will become of them?

02:00.708 --> 02:05.166
It seems as if Mother Nature
didn't want those four children

02:05.250 --> 02:06.750
to leave that place.

02:33.333 --> 02:35.833
These kids are Colombia's children.

03:00.250 --> 03:02.833
Good morning.
It's 9:00 a.m. here in Bogotá.

03:02.916 --> 03:06.958
Hello to all our viewers who have
just tuned in to watch our broadcast.

03:10.083 --> 03:13.416
Listen carefully.
An aircraft has gone missing

03:13.500 --> 03:16.541
en route from Araracuara
to San José del Guaviare.

03:25.583 --> 03:27.375
And this story
becomes more and more tragic.

03:27.458 --> 03:30.000
On board are four Indigenous children
and their mother,

03:30.083 --> 03:32.791
who were traveling
to meet their father in Bogotá.

03:33.875 --> 03:38.000
The plane's last reported location
was deep in the Amazon rainforest,

03:38.083 --> 03:40.416
in a hard-to-reach remote area.

03:42.583 --> 03:45.500
We're live with Manuel Ranoque,
the children's father,

03:45.583 --> 03:48.166
who spoke about his missing family.

03:48.250 --> 03:51.291
The woman's name
is Magdalena Mucutuy Valencia.

03:51.375 --> 03:54.666
The 13-year-old girl
is Lesly Jacobombaire Mucutuy.

03:54.750 --> 03:59.541
The nine-year-old girl is Soleiny Mucutuy.

03:59.625 --> 04:03.083
The four-year-old boy,
Tien Noriel Ranoque Mucutuy,

04:03.791 --> 04:05.791
and the 11-month-old girl…

04:21.416 --> 04:23.833
Our ancestors were nomads, weren't they?

04:24.625 --> 04:27.208
They went from one place to another,

04:28.166 --> 04:29.750
collecting fruit.

04:33.208 --> 04:36.416
And when I first heard
that the plane went down,

04:36.500 --> 04:38.625
I thought, "Oh my God, the children died."

04:43.125 --> 04:46.166
It was very hard
because the children used to sit here.

04:47.166 --> 04:50.750
Those drawings up there are theirs,
and they sat here, at this desk.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.916
It's such an empty feeling. I can't…

05:02.208 --> 05:05.375
I felt as if my own children had died.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.750
I thought about the youngest one.

05:19.708 --> 05:23.000
And I said to myself,
"If you go down in a small plane,

05:24.125 --> 05:25.333
you don't survive."

05:30.583 --> 05:33.500
Relief agencies are intensifying
their search for the plane

05:33.583 --> 05:35.750
that disappeared last Sunday.

05:35.833 --> 05:38.000
We have reports
that an elite military squad

05:38.083 --> 05:40.833
will be deployed to the location

05:40.916 --> 05:44.125
of the plane's last transmitted signal.

05:56.875 --> 06:00.250
My general called
and ordered me to join the search.

06:04.333 --> 06:06.875
We immediately deployed all units.

06:10.291 --> 06:13.416
There seems to be a ravine
at the northern sector.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.750
The commandos say it's difficult to cross.

06:16.958 --> 06:19.500
In an unprecedented twist,
the country's special forces

06:19.583 --> 06:22.833
are being deployed
in search of the missing plane.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.750
And they're heading into territory

06:24.833 --> 06:27.833
that is still controlled
by the former FARC terrorist group.

06:32.625 --> 06:36.250
There was a huge forest canopy.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.958
It's an inhospitable jungle,

06:41.625 --> 06:43.250
a thick jungle.

06:44.041 --> 06:46.208
My men and I just looked at each other.

06:46.708 --> 06:50.250
It's like looking
for a needle in a haystack.

07:16.625 --> 07:22.333
There, we began our first task,
which was to search for the aircraft.

07:56.416 --> 07:59.000
It was possible
that they had survived the accident.

08:00.583 --> 08:04.333
But, as the days went by,
if one of them had died,

08:04.416 --> 08:06.416
it would attract wild animals.

08:07.666 --> 08:09.708
Obviously, as time went on,

08:09.791 --> 08:13.541
the chances of finding them alive
were getting slimmer.

08:28.500 --> 08:30.791
I cried so much when I found out

08:31.375 --> 08:33.625
about my sister and the children.

08:40.958 --> 08:43.291
I felt as if they were my children.

08:45.166 --> 08:48.541
My son liked playing with Soleiny.

08:50.458 --> 08:52.291
He did everything with Soleiny.

08:58.750 --> 09:03.625
She was always happy.
She didn't even know what sadness was.

09:09.333 --> 09:14.041
Tien Noriel was a very headstrong boy.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.500
And he was very affectionate.

09:29.708 --> 09:32.416
Lesly loved taking selfies.

09:33.083 --> 09:35.833
She liked listening to music.

09:44.791 --> 09:47.583
Cristin was just a baby.

09:48.208 --> 09:49.666
So vulnerable.

09:59.750 --> 10:01.000
This one on the ground?

10:01.083 --> 10:03.791
Put this one on the ground
and the other as a cover.

10:10.625 --> 10:15.416
They informed us that the plane
had emitted an emergency signal,

10:15.500 --> 10:19.333
but that didn't tell us
its exact location.

10:20.541 --> 10:24.583
We started to search
each quadrant of the jungle thoroughly.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.041
They were divided into kilometers,

10:27.125 --> 10:28.458
from north to south.

10:32.250 --> 10:37.500
There were two things
on your mind all the time.

10:37.583 --> 10:39.125
Searching for the plane and the enemy.

10:43.583 --> 10:47.208
This area has a strong presence
of FARC dissidents.

10:47.291 --> 10:50.416
It's a guerrilla terrorist group.

10:50.500 --> 10:53.375
According to the authorities,
it's funded by drug traffickers.

10:54.250 --> 10:56.375
Now I want you to look at these men.

10:56.458 --> 10:58.708
We cannot show you their faces.

10:58.791 --> 11:02.000
Why are we speaking so quietly now?

11:02.083 --> 11:04.958
We don't want to be detected by the enemy.

11:06.416 --> 11:09.500
There are reports that a small group
from an Indigenous community

11:09.583 --> 11:12.125
is also looking for the plane.

11:12.208 --> 11:13.625
But there are concerns.

11:13.708 --> 11:16.708
The search is creating
a high level of tension

11:16.791 --> 11:18.875
due to the historic conflict

11:18.958 --> 11:22.041
between some Indigenous communities
and the army.

11:32.291 --> 11:36.833
I heard that one of our regional leaders
was on the plane.

11:38.708 --> 11:42.541
We're from the same clan,
the Huitoto ethnic group.

11:44.916 --> 11:49.500
That was one of the reasons
I joined the search for the plane.

11:51.916 --> 11:55.166
But there was another underlying reason.

11:58.708 --> 12:03.791
I went kind of
because I was separating from my wife.

12:05.250 --> 12:06.333
I wanted to get away.

12:06.833 --> 12:11.208
I just wanted to forget
what I was going through.

12:15.291 --> 12:19.208
It's been a week since the accident,
and there are no signs of the plane.

12:19.291 --> 12:22.333
Experts are saying
that if the survivors have been injured,

12:22.416 --> 12:24.833
they're likely to have developed
an infection by now.

12:45.833 --> 12:48.500
I joined a small rescue group

12:48.583 --> 12:51.750
with Manuel Ranoque,
the children's father.

12:58.541 --> 13:02.041
Do whatever you can to ignite it.
Everything is so wet.

13:04.708 --> 13:07.875
From a young age,
my father would take me hunting.

13:09.333 --> 13:10.791
He'd take me fishing,

13:11.666 --> 13:15.333
teach me to quickly identify the jungle
and find my bearings.

13:15.416 --> 13:17.541
We mostly use the sun.

13:18.875 --> 13:22.541
This is our culture,
our origin, our principle.

13:24.958 --> 13:28.875
This is a life
that the white world looks down on.

13:32.208 --> 13:34.041
If the people were dead,

13:35.416 --> 13:38.375
vultures would be circling over the plane.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.208
We applied all our knowledge.

14:05.541 --> 14:08.416
We searched that entire first week,
and we didn't find anything.

14:13.791 --> 14:16.208
Nothing at all, so we were worried.

14:22.416 --> 14:27.083
One day, the Civil Aeronautics authority
gave us the plane's last coordinates,

14:27.583 --> 14:30.916
but those coordinates didn't make sense.

14:32.458 --> 14:35.583
They were 500 meters
from the Apaporis riverbank.

14:37.750 --> 14:40.583
So we visualized the plane's flight path.

14:42.583 --> 14:44.208
And we kept going.

14:50.625 --> 14:53.166
I'd say, "Guys, we're going upstream."

14:55.750 --> 14:58.500
And we kept going all day.

15:10.833 --> 15:14.333
Suddenly, a boy named Alejandro…

15:15.750 --> 15:17.000
Alejandro,

15:18.333 --> 15:21.291
he was a 14-year-old boy.

15:22.041 --> 15:25.333
He'd never been to civilization.

15:27.125 --> 15:30.541
He said, "Hey, there's a blue house
in the bush."

15:46.791 --> 15:49.958
Of course, I jumped for joy.

15:54.875 --> 15:56.208
We found the aircraft.

16:05.666 --> 16:07.791
He said, "But there's no one alive."

16:09.083 --> 16:11.958
We even told Manuel
that all his kids were dead.

16:15.875 --> 16:18.500
The truth is he didn't react.
He didn't say a thing.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.833
That day, command informed me

16:43.958 --> 16:46.583
that some Indigenous people
had found the plane.

16:55.375 --> 16:58.458
My first task then

16:59.166 --> 17:02.791
was to identify how many dead bodies
were in the aircraft.

17:07.666 --> 17:09.833
By the sneakers, which were pretty small,

17:10.583 --> 17:12.833
by the body type, the long hair,

17:13.333 --> 17:16.708
that's how we identified
that there was a female.

17:18.166 --> 17:19.291
She was dead.

17:25.166 --> 17:29.250
My sister Magdalena
was like a mother to me.

17:32.333 --> 17:37.708
I used to tell her,
"With you, I feel protected."

17:43.791 --> 17:47.791
We shared everything,
we'd talk, mess around.

17:54.500 --> 17:57.500
I wish she'd never boarded that plane.

18:16.333 --> 18:18.583
In spite of the sadness, we were happy

18:18.666 --> 18:20.875
because the mission was to find the plane,

18:20.958 --> 18:22.750
so now we could go.

18:25.750 --> 18:27.750
However, one of the guys asked me,

18:27.833 --> 18:30.166
"Henry, whenever a plane goes down,

18:31.541 --> 18:34.291
do suitcases fly out?"

18:35.625 --> 18:38.000
He said, "I found suitcases outside,

18:39.750 --> 18:42.125
and it looks
as if someone's gone through them."

18:45.500 --> 18:46.791
I said, "What?"

19:02.041 --> 19:04.958
Because of the plane's vertical position,

19:05.041 --> 19:10.625
we just couldn't see
how many bodies were inside.

19:11.208 --> 19:12.833
Legionnaire, Popeye.

19:14.250 --> 19:15.708
Receiving, sir. Go ahead.

19:20.291 --> 19:23.625
Out of the blue, the sergeant reported,

19:24.833 --> 19:27.041
"Captain, I found a baby bottle."

19:32.166 --> 19:35.000
A baby bottle in the jungle?
It took me by surprise.

19:39.916 --> 19:45.125
And then we found a wild passion fruit.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.458
It had been bitten by a human being.

19:57.208 --> 19:59.625
And on the same path, we found a shelter.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.333
We continued to search
for bodies in the plane.

20:14.541 --> 20:17.750
We were able to verify
that there were two more adults.

20:19.041 --> 20:23.458
But we didn't identify any small bodies.

20:25.916 --> 20:27.541
The children aren't there.

20:27.625 --> 20:29.166
How can that be?

20:30.125 --> 20:31.500
The kids aren't there.

20:32.083 --> 20:33.833
The kids must be alive!

20:43.583 --> 20:46.166
When I found out
that the children weren't dead,

20:49.208 --> 20:51.541
I thought,
"God, who's going to find them now?"

20:54.541 --> 20:55.833
"And where?"

20:57.708 --> 21:00.708
I felt like my heart was giving up on me.

21:01.541 --> 21:03.083
"What could they be eating?"

21:03.791 --> 21:05.625
"The baby girl, what is she eating?"

21:12.500 --> 21:13.875
"What will become of them?"

21:40.833 --> 21:44.291
The four children have been lost
in the jungle for more than two weeks.

21:44.375 --> 21:46.791
Army sources estimate that, by now,

21:46.875 --> 21:51.666
they could have walked 100 kilometers
from the crash site,

21:51.750 --> 21:53.958
which gives them a search area

21:54.041 --> 21:56.958
more than three times
as big the Bogotá urban area.

21:59.125 --> 22:00.625
The family asked me,

22:00.708 --> 22:04.875
"General, when are you going to stop?
How long will you keep looking for them?"

22:04.958 --> 22:06.166
"It's obvious."

22:08.250 --> 22:09.250
I said,

22:10.666 --> 22:12.250
"Until we find them."

22:26.125 --> 22:30.583
This operation
has been dubbed "Operation Hope."

22:33.833 --> 22:36.166
"There are survivors.
We need to move fast."

22:45.125 --> 22:46.666
It's treacherous terrain.

22:47.333 --> 22:50.583
It rains almost 16 hours a day.

22:50.666 --> 22:52.875
We'll bring back those four minors

22:52.958 --> 22:56.291
because the closest thing
to creating a life is saving one.

22:57.500 --> 22:59.416
"We have to change tack."

22:59.500 --> 23:01.083
"Now, start making noise."

23:03.875 --> 23:05.708
We'd scream the kids' names.

23:08.166 --> 23:13.041
This is Wilson, a dog
with search and rescue experience.

23:13.125 --> 23:16.375
This Belgian Malinois dog
is one and a half years old

23:16.458 --> 23:19.666
and is very experienced
in the search and rescue of humans.

23:19.750 --> 23:23.958
The audio of the lost children's grandma
is repeated over and over again.

23:24.041 --> 23:27.375
It's your grandmother Fátima.

23:27.458 --> 23:32.833
We are looking for you.

23:32.916 --> 23:37.541
Stay where you are. Don't move.

23:37.625 --> 23:39.458
Darlings, please stop moving around.

23:39.541 --> 23:41.166
Elsewhere in the jungle,

23:41.250 --> 23:44.791
two other units connect
their mobile phones to this megaphone

23:44.875 --> 23:48.375
to play the grandmother's message
and guide the children.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.083
A hundred kits
in perfectly outlined quadrants

23:54.458 --> 23:56.666
in order to extend their lives.

24:03.208 --> 24:06.541
Entire Colombian families
are following the news

24:06.625 --> 24:09.000
in restaurants, on the streets.

24:09.083 --> 24:12.416
It's very dangerous.
There are snakes, spiders.

24:12.500 --> 24:14.041
I doubt they'll last long.

24:14.541 --> 24:16.541
I don't think they'll survive.

24:17.208 --> 24:19.333
Your children mean everything to you.

24:20.208 --> 24:21.791
You'd give your life for them.

24:24.083 --> 24:27.250
These powerful reflectors,
installed at strategic points,

24:27.333 --> 24:30.458
aim to guide
the four missing Indigenous children.

24:30.541 --> 24:32.708
We launched more than 10,000 flyers.

24:32.791 --> 24:35.458
In Huitoto, but also in Spanish.

24:35.541 --> 24:39.250
They read,
"Stay close to the water. Don't move."

24:39.333 --> 24:42.833
This is the Colombian Air Force's
iconic "ghost plane."

24:42.916 --> 24:46.000
From the sky, it monitors
and guides the military

24:46.083 --> 24:48.750
in the most complex operations
in the country.

24:49.416 --> 24:53.541
This is the crew of the ghost plane,
who, this Wednesday night,

24:53.625 --> 24:55.583
strengthened the search for the children

24:55.666 --> 25:00.791
by shooting flares to light their way
and help the searchers to locate them.

25:07.041 --> 25:10.125
The noise and light could attract danger.

25:12.583 --> 25:15.875
It could attract terrorists
wanting to kill our men.

25:20.000 --> 25:25.875
I think that the army's mindset…

25:26.458 --> 25:28.500
They prepare for war.

25:29.000 --> 25:33.166
But they were never prepared
for this mission. Never.

25:40.916 --> 25:44.166
The Indigenous people
didn't want to collaborate with the army.

25:44.833 --> 25:47.083
They said that they'd work on their own.

25:48.666 --> 25:53.875
So, at first, we were very cautious
and aware of safety.

26:01.625 --> 26:04.833
We'd say, "What if, one day,
they decide to attack us?"

26:11.708 --> 26:14.208
The Indigenous people
are very good people.

26:15.541 --> 26:19.750
However, criminals and murderers
infiltrate Indigenous groups.

26:22.750 --> 26:26.333
I myself don't like any armed groups

26:26.416 --> 26:29.375
because of what's happened in our region.

26:29.875 --> 26:33.375
Several years ago,
the army disappeared a young man.

26:35.125 --> 26:39.250
There have been many cases
of massacres and atrocities

26:39.333 --> 26:41.083
during the armed conflict.

26:47.000 --> 26:50.833
From the moment
Western man arrived in our territory,

26:50.916 --> 26:55.166
we have been massacred
and our culture has been destroyed.

27:07.833 --> 27:09.041
I remember

27:09.875 --> 27:12.083
one day, it was raining a lot.

27:16.958 --> 27:19.541
All of a sudden, I heard a soldier.

27:21.541 --> 27:24.166
He said, "Stay still or I'll shoot."

27:26.333 --> 27:30.125
He was already in a position
to take the shot.

27:30.208 --> 27:32.041
They thought we were guerrilla fighters.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.166
It almost made me cry.

27:39.541 --> 27:42.250
I regretted coming,
thinking, "What am I doing here?"

27:53.958 --> 27:57.583
I began to doubt my ability as a leader.

28:03.500 --> 28:07.708
I started as a leader back in 1993.

28:10.291 --> 28:12.708
I started out
with high expectations, believe me.

28:14.375 --> 28:17.750
We live in an area
that has always been neglected.

28:17.833 --> 28:21.083
That's why the guerrilla dissidents

28:21.666 --> 28:24.458
have regained their power.

28:26.250 --> 28:28.041
With these kinds of groups,

28:28.125 --> 28:30.208
you must accept what they say.

28:34.416 --> 28:38.833
As a parent,
you want to support your family.

28:43.041 --> 28:45.458
In the past, I fell into crime.

28:46.791 --> 28:51.333
I've worked in labs processing cocaine.

28:56.250 --> 28:57.958
As time went by,

28:58.041 --> 29:03.166
drinking and corruption marked my decline.

29:07.041 --> 29:09.250
People stop believing in you.

29:10.000 --> 29:13.208
And that was rock bottom for me.

29:27.416 --> 29:30.958
First, I can say
that I'm not well emotionally

29:31.041 --> 29:33.166
because this is a hard blow.

29:33.750 --> 29:38.000
But I have faith that I can be
with my children again, with my family.

29:38.083 --> 29:39.416
That's what matters the most.

29:40.708 --> 29:42.000
I'm okay.

29:42.083 --> 29:45.666
I'm motivated
because I know we'll succeed soon.

30:03.625 --> 30:08.416
That day was one
of the most shocking days…

30:11.166 --> 30:14.833
because we removed the three bodies
from the crash site.

30:20.791 --> 30:23.416
That same day, our dog Wilson got lost.

30:30.291 --> 30:34.458
This morning, the bodies
were removed from the area,

30:34.541 --> 30:39.416
transported by this Black Hawk helicopter
to San José del Guaviare.

31:06.166 --> 31:07.333
God, my Lord,

31:08.583 --> 31:10.000
you who have control

31:10.958 --> 31:12.458
on Earth and in Heaven,

31:13.541 --> 31:15.000
allow us

31:15.083 --> 31:16.750
on this day

31:16.833 --> 31:18.541
to find

31:18.625 --> 31:19.875
our children.

31:20.416 --> 31:25.916
I would wonder about how these kids felt
being involved in this accident.

31:27.208 --> 31:29.791
Then seeing their mother dead.

31:31.166 --> 31:33.416
My daughters
are the most important thing to me.

31:33.916 --> 31:37.000
As a father, I felt pretty powerless.

31:37.083 --> 31:38.375
It made me want to cry.

31:44.500 --> 31:47.000
That day, I felt helpless.

31:50.833 --> 31:52.833
I said, "We've exhausted

31:53.625 --> 31:56.250
and used the best
the country has to offer,

31:56.958 --> 31:59.583
yet they haven't located
our four children."

32:11.250 --> 32:16.833
I felt there was a higher power

32:16.916 --> 32:18.208
that wouldn't allow

32:20.500 --> 32:25.375
the science and way of the military
to find these four minors.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.375
General, I'd like to ask…

32:44.458 --> 32:48.166
The entire country is waiting
for these children to appear,

32:48.250 --> 32:51.125
but, 20 days after the accident,

32:51.208 --> 32:54.875
you have raised the possibility
that they may no longer be alive.

32:54.958 --> 32:55.958
What's your opinion?

32:56.958 --> 32:57.833
It depends.

32:57.916 --> 33:02.250
It's contingent on the conditions
the four children were left in.

33:02.750 --> 33:06.916
For instance,
we haven't heard a baby's cry.

33:07.416 --> 33:11.250
That's what we would expect
from an 11-month-old baby.

33:11.833 --> 33:14.500
Or a child screaming.

33:14.583 --> 33:16.125
But we haven't heard any of that.

33:22.875 --> 33:26.291
A couple of minutes ago,
some Indigenous representatives arrived.

33:26.375 --> 33:29.958
They are meeting here,
at the Military Central Command.

33:30.750 --> 33:32.791
We had to change our strategy.

33:33.791 --> 33:37.708
Five teams from the Indigenous community
will join us,

33:37.791 --> 33:40.750
and we'll work in groups.

33:45.083 --> 33:48.083
It's 6:01 a.m. Hello to all our listeners.

33:48.166 --> 33:52.583
I heard on the news, on social media,
about an accident.

33:52.666 --> 33:56.166
…with all eyes on the search
for the children. Operation Hope…

33:56.250 --> 33:59.708
I said, "The professionals
should take care of it."

34:00.416 --> 34:01.916
"I'm doing my own thing."

34:08.041 --> 34:12.458
Then a friend tells me, "But, Nicolás,
with your knowledge of the jungle,

34:12.541 --> 34:13.750
you should go."

34:16.000 --> 34:18.166
That's where I was born and raised.

34:19.125 --> 34:20.208
In the jungle.

34:23.125 --> 34:24.166
My home.

34:24.916 --> 34:26.500
I like it. It's my environment.

34:29.666 --> 34:33.791
But, for a long time,
I lived a life far away from it.

34:37.750 --> 34:40.083
At least 40 members
of the Indigenous Guard

34:40.166 --> 34:42.041
have arrived in San José del Guaviare

34:42.125 --> 34:46.375
to join the search for the four children
who are missing after the plane crash.

34:46.958 --> 34:51.333
-Guard!
-Force!

34:51.416 --> 34:55.708
-For how long?
-Forever!

34:55.791 --> 34:58.875
They came from Puerto Leguizamo,
Caquetá, and Cauca.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.375
Today, joining the rescue team

35:02.458 --> 35:06.541
are those who have a special connection
with the jungle, 85 Indigenous people.

35:07.125 --> 35:10.875
-For how long?
-Forever!

35:10.958 --> 35:13.583
What I looked for first
was a familiar face.

35:15.250 --> 35:16.541
I found it. There he was.

35:17.166 --> 35:18.208
Eliécer.

35:36.791 --> 35:39.500
We saw it on TV.

35:40.750 --> 35:44.333
The accident and everything that happened.

35:46.625 --> 35:51.208
We didn't pay that much attention
because it was the government.

35:55.458 --> 35:59.958
They tend to belittle our knowledge.

36:01.041 --> 36:03.958
And we didn't want to work
with the military.

36:09.041 --> 36:12.541
But then they said
there were children involved.

36:16.416 --> 36:21.125
Maybe the father of the children
was suffering like I had.

36:24.250 --> 36:28.000
So, that night,
I told my wife, "I want to go."

36:37.458 --> 36:40.333
This is the first time
that the army and Indigenous groups

36:40.416 --> 36:43.083
have joined forces
for an official mission.

36:44.666 --> 36:48.125
Many of these Indigenous volunteers
distrust the army

36:48.208 --> 36:51.250
after more than 50 years
of internal armed conflict.

36:56.125 --> 36:59.541
Twenty-one days have elapsed
since the plane crash.

37:00.541 --> 37:04.666
The human body cannot survive
for more than three weeks without food.

37:06.583 --> 37:10.791
Time is of the essence
to find the four children.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.916
When the reinforcements arrived,
I went and greeted them.

37:25.000 --> 37:26.833
"I'm Henry Guerrero from Araracuara."

37:30.333 --> 37:34.083
That's when I met the Putumayo group.
Eliécer, Nicolás.

37:35.875 --> 37:36.875
Okay now.

37:38.250 --> 37:42.333
We need to follow the tracks
to see where the children went.

37:42.416 --> 37:44.875
If they went up or to the middle.

37:44.958 --> 37:46.458
Which way did you go?

37:46.541 --> 37:50.500
I told them,
"Some of you go down a central trail."

37:50.583 --> 37:52.791
We were going to sweep
the entire territory.

38:02.750 --> 38:04.708
We'll go forward and follow the curve.

38:07.500 --> 38:11.333
We understood
there would be external factors

38:12.416 --> 38:14.250
that would make it really hard for us.

38:15.416 --> 38:16.750
Dear friends,

38:17.666 --> 38:20.083
as you can hear in the background,

38:20.166 --> 38:23.416
the helicopters are sending messages out
to the children from above.

38:24.333 --> 38:26.125
But this territory is very…

38:26.916 --> 38:28.875
It's truly complicated territory.

38:28.958 --> 38:31.750
It's very…

38:31.833 --> 38:33.375
You can feel the pressure.

38:34.333 --> 38:38.208
There were times
that we came across sacred areas.

38:38.291 --> 38:41.125
We'd get there,
and it would start raining or thundering.

38:45.541 --> 38:50.500
When I entered the territory…

38:52.500 --> 38:53.916
I freaked out.

38:54.791 --> 38:58.250
I was overwhelmed by the power of nature.

39:02.583 --> 39:06.166
Every territory has its guardians,

39:06.250 --> 39:08.500
beings that take care of it.

39:12.166 --> 39:14.666
I used to tell the children
that there are duendes,

39:17.333 --> 39:21.916
animals that turn into human beings,

39:22.000 --> 39:23.791
and they can take you away.

39:25.875 --> 39:27.291
I was very scared.

39:42.333 --> 39:43.750
A duende is a spirit.

39:47.166 --> 39:49.666
You feel it walking, touching you,
but you can't see it

39:49.750 --> 39:51.000
because it's a spirit.

39:56.791 --> 39:59.166
My job was to fight against the duende.

40:06.250 --> 40:08.166
Because the duende had the kids.

40:25.208 --> 40:26.916
Of course, I was scared.

40:34.625 --> 40:40.666
Don Rubio the Elder
was in charge of finding the children

40:40.750 --> 40:42.166
as the spiritual elder.

40:43.041 --> 40:46.000
All I ask is for the kids to be returned.

40:46.791 --> 40:48.375
Leave the searchers alone.

40:48.458 --> 40:52.166
The issue is between you and me,
so turn back.

40:56.125 --> 40:58.416
We began a ritual in the jungle.

41:01.125 --> 41:05.125
White men think that rituals
are doing a ceremony, dancing…

41:05.208 --> 41:07.541
They imagine all sorts of things.

41:08.916 --> 41:10.833
Our ritual involves taking mambe.

41:12.791 --> 41:16.666
Mambe is made from coca leaves.

41:19.833 --> 41:23.208
For us, tobacco and coca are very sacred.

41:26.333 --> 41:28.875
I use ambil, which is tobacco,

41:29.791 --> 41:34.125
and I take mambe to silence my mind

41:35.958 --> 41:37.458
and to listen.

41:39.041 --> 41:41.041
To connect with the sounds of nature.

41:43.166 --> 41:45.750
I was very moved by that experience.

41:53.500 --> 41:59.208
We were going to cut down
as few vines and trees as possible

41:59.291 --> 42:01.458
because this forest is not ours.

42:10.833 --> 42:14.791
The Indigenous people
are used to these supernatural things

42:14.875 --> 42:18.375
that happen in the jungle,
with their rituals and all those things.

42:20.833 --> 42:24.541
But the commandos posted there,
we're Catholic people.

42:26.250 --> 42:27.791
We believe there is

42:29.125 --> 42:30.291
one God.

42:31.333 --> 42:33.250
We looked at each other.

42:34.375 --> 42:37.083
"That's really abnormal!"

42:49.625 --> 42:52.500
After leaving the war,

42:52.583 --> 42:56.041
I don't like anyone who carries a gun.

43:01.916 --> 43:06.750
As a child, I was recruited
by outlaw armed groups.

43:08.791 --> 43:12.458
I was around 12 or 13 years old.

43:13.583 --> 43:17.666
One, two, three, four.

43:18.625 --> 43:22.666
Okay, now, attention. One, two…

43:24.166 --> 43:28.250
It creates a lot of trauma, sad memories.

43:31.083 --> 43:34.166
Weapons, war, drugs.

43:40.375 --> 43:45.416
Memories that make you question
the very existence

43:45.958 --> 43:48.000
of family.

43:53.041 --> 43:54.833
I was there for a long time.

43:56.291 --> 43:57.416
I was lost.

44:01.500 --> 44:03.291
And then I became very sad.

44:09.666 --> 44:14.041
I returned to my community
when I turned 17.

44:16.666 --> 44:19.291
After all that time lost to the war,

44:20.916 --> 44:23.541
my mother's smile
and my brothers' embrace…

44:25.958 --> 44:27.375
that's everything to me.

44:29.666 --> 44:31.250
I returned to my family.

44:33.250 --> 44:34.541
To my community.

44:39.750 --> 44:41.166
And I started to change.

44:57.000 --> 45:00.333
The military walks in single file.

45:02.666 --> 45:06.000
But we were moving differently.

45:08.958 --> 45:12.625
We were trying to think like children,
and children never sit still.

45:13.333 --> 45:17.083
So we also moved like children.

45:18.333 --> 45:20.208
With no clear direction.

45:21.458 --> 45:26.458
We were following our intuition,
like a child would.

45:28.583 --> 45:32.708
We started to find traces.

45:34.708 --> 45:39.125
While searching for the children,
a baby's bottle cap has been found.

45:40.458 --> 45:42.291
A dirty diaper.

45:44.375 --> 45:45.916
We found a lead!

45:46.666 --> 45:48.916
We found some kids' clothing.

45:49.416 --> 45:52.458
Some sneakers and a diaper
in the middle of the jungle…

45:52.541 --> 45:55.416
And a green towel as well.

45:56.708 --> 45:58.625
This is where the children last slept.

46:00.791 --> 46:02.625
Where they changed the diapers.

46:06.000 --> 46:09.208
They were here four or five days.
They stayed here for a while.

46:10.208 --> 46:12.375
This is where they took…

46:13.416 --> 46:15.250
Look, this one looks chewed on.

46:15.333 --> 46:19.083
Look at this.
It's been bitten. Those are teeth marks.

46:45.791 --> 46:47.500
We ask you, Lord,

46:47.583 --> 46:49.416
for today to be the day

46:49.500 --> 46:51.666
that we can make

46:51.750 --> 46:53.916
a miracle on Earth happen.

46:54.000 --> 46:56.083
For the birthday

46:56.166 --> 46:58.916
of our sister Cristin.

47:17.916 --> 47:20.791
I knew what that family was going through.

47:24.125 --> 47:28.000
I lost my father and my brother,
my only brother.

47:31.541 --> 47:33.916
I'd visit my father every year.

47:36.291 --> 47:37.583
Until…

47:40.875 --> 47:45.291
the time he disappeared.

47:47.875 --> 47:51.791
With the war, many of us Colombians
have suffered the consequences.

47:52.833 --> 47:57.583
Forced disappearance
is a crime against humanity!

47:59.875 --> 48:04.083
I can't say which armed group took them.

48:05.541 --> 48:09.875
My brother, we don't know
why they took him either.

48:12.875 --> 48:16.333
I quit my job to search for them.

48:16.416 --> 48:21.000
Justice, reparations, and no repetition!

48:24.416 --> 48:26.208
That was 23 years ago.

48:35.958 --> 48:37.875
But I'm still searching.

49:02.041 --> 49:05.916
I was in a constant spiritual battle.

49:08.791 --> 49:11.791
I was scared
that the duende might take my life.

49:16.125 --> 49:17.166
It could kill me.

49:19.708 --> 49:21.750
Every day is harder.

49:27.541 --> 49:29.416
Release the children!

49:38.583 --> 49:41.708
Three days went by and nothing.

49:44.083 --> 49:47.166
Sickness hit all of us really hard.

49:49.458 --> 49:50.375
Well…

49:51.666 --> 49:55.291
It was a cough with chest pain.

49:56.875 --> 50:00.041
Then shivers and fever.

50:02.791 --> 50:04.916
Our comrades started to drop out.

50:06.625 --> 50:09.458
Five journalists left, one officer,

50:09.541 --> 50:10.916
six Indigenous people,

50:11.000 --> 50:14.416
who are all sick.

50:23.000 --> 50:25.000
Rubio also got sick.

50:31.125 --> 50:32.708
He was very sick.

50:34.375 --> 50:36.583
He was coughing up blood.

50:37.458 --> 50:39.708
I thought,
"He's gonna die on us in the bush."

50:41.416 --> 50:43.833
This is not a disease or a cough or COVID.

50:43.916 --> 50:45.750
The duende got me.

50:46.833 --> 50:48.333
Because it said we had to pay.

50:52.250 --> 50:55.333
We didn't want to ask
the military for help.

51:02.125 --> 51:04.500
But we saw the need

51:06.083 --> 51:08.500
to join them.

51:11.208 --> 51:13.208
We arrived, and they were ill.

51:17.000 --> 51:21.166
I was the nurse
for the reconnaissance team.

51:22.041 --> 51:25.625
I started making remedies for them.
Around ten of them were sick.

51:26.750 --> 51:28.583
How long has Rubio been like this?

51:28.666 --> 51:33.458
If he doesn't get better within two days,
we'll have to send him home.

51:36.041 --> 51:40.833
It wasn't easy to accept
that I had to work with them.

51:42.750 --> 51:45.875
But it didn't matter.
It was what we had to do.

51:45.958 --> 51:51.041
Because you've been going around
in wet clothes, it could be pneumonia.

51:56.958 --> 52:00.666
They left their rifles in their camps

52:00.750 --> 52:03.416
and came only in their camouflage
to talk to us.

52:06.000 --> 52:10.416
Next time I go out, I'll carry
some mint in my backpack as well,

52:10.500 --> 52:13.041
but it’s not going to work
if you carry liquor too.

52:13.125 --> 52:15.375
-A bit of aguardiente.
-Yeah, aguardiente.

52:42.750 --> 52:45.250
The magic question
that we asked ourselves was,

52:47.166 --> 52:50.791
"If we have everything we need
and we're getting sick,

52:51.875 --> 52:53.625
how are the kids doing?"

52:55.125 --> 52:56.666
"Are they sick?"

52:57.958 --> 52:59.916
"Will all four of them be there?"

53:00.833 --> 53:02.875
"Has one of them died?"

53:28.583 --> 53:29.750
We need to…

53:29.833 --> 53:33.166
We move on.
We move on or figure out another strategy.

53:33.250 --> 53:35.583
-Good morning. How's everyone?
-Good.

53:35.666 --> 53:38.083
-How's it going, Mr. Shaman?
-Just hanging.

53:38.666 --> 53:41.666
Where do you guys think
we need to go to continue the search?

53:41.750 --> 53:42.791
We'll call.

53:44.208 --> 53:46.166
Tell us.
We'll spread the word on the radio.

53:46.666 --> 53:48.375
From that moment on,

53:48.458 --> 53:52.291
our commandos walked
wherever they were told.

53:52.375 --> 53:55.583
Not following military ways and science,

53:56.125 --> 53:58.250
but Indigenous knowledge.

54:15.458 --> 54:17.666
This map from the military forces

54:17.750 --> 54:19.583
shows that, after the accident,

54:19.666 --> 54:22.708
the children walked westbound
about 500 meters.

54:22.791 --> 54:25.833
The graphic shows
that they then moved northeast

54:25.916 --> 54:27.291
for almost two kilometers.

54:27.375 --> 54:31.375
The search area has been reduced
to 20 square kilometers.

54:31.458 --> 54:33.333
The search area is shrinking,

54:33.416 --> 54:36.791
but so are the odds
of finding the children alive.

54:41.083 --> 54:42.083
How are we doing?

54:45.791 --> 54:47.458
Why can't we find the children?

54:48.833 --> 54:51.583
-Are we going in the right direction?
-Yes.

54:51.666 --> 54:53.875
Even if they're dead,
why can't we find them?

54:55.708 --> 55:00.583
Maybe they weren't used
to seeing the soldiers

55:01.958 --> 55:03.333
as good people.

55:05.000 --> 55:07.250
We've been mistreated before.

55:09.375 --> 55:15.833
So that makes you start wondering.

55:21.625 --> 55:24.458
I knew what was happening.

55:30.708 --> 55:34.583
Lesly didn't want to be found

55:34.666 --> 55:36.708
because she didn't want to see Manuel.

55:45.125 --> 55:48.000
I feel a lot of anger towards that man

55:49.625 --> 55:51.625
because of what happened with my sister.

55:57.250 --> 55:59.208
Lesly is a quiet child.

55:59.875 --> 56:01.708
WILD FRUIT
PATAWA, AÇAI, YUCCA

56:01.791 --> 56:04.083
Very quiet.
She barely spoke in the classroom.

56:06.375 --> 56:08.000
She liked to read and draw.

56:08.541 --> 56:11.166
She was good at drawing.

56:15.250 --> 56:20.625
I'd ask her,
"Lesly, tell me, are you in any trouble?"

56:21.291 --> 56:22.791
She'd just shrink away.

56:24.291 --> 56:27.958
She sometimes looked
like she'd been crying.

56:29.083 --> 56:34.625
Lesly was the one who witnessed
what happened to my sister Magdalena.

56:37.500 --> 56:40.791
It's true, he abused
my daughter Magdalena.

56:41.875 --> 56:44.458
He grabbed her and hit her with a machete.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.291
With the flat side.

56:46.833 --> 56:48.500
And here, she had…

56:48.583 --> 56:50.708
It was her hair that protected her.

56:50.791 --> 56:52.833
He was going to chop off her head.

56:52.916 --> 56:56.875
The children were scared
and hid in the bush.

57:00.083 --> 57:03.500
I think the children
were now hiding from that horror.

57:07.416 --> 57:09.583
That's why they were hiding.

57:25.666 --> 57:27.916
The people who were there searching

57:28.000 --> 57:30.666
didn't know what had happened.

57:37.500 --> 57:41.666
They thought he was a good father
and cared about his children.

57:47.500 --> 57:49.250
Good morning to all units.

57:49.333 --> 57:52.666
First, I want to thank you
for all the work you're doing.

57:52.750 --> 57:57.666
I have faith that today
we'll find the children.

57:57.750 --> 58:03.333
I wish all the special units here with us
success.

58:03.416 --> 58:05.375
Thank you for this help.

58:10.708 --> 58:13.166
The jungle knew that he was a bad father.

58:31.208 --> 58:32.583
What are you doing, Shaman?

58:32.666 --> 58:36.083
We're making arepas. What kind?

58:36.166 --> 58:38.958
-Five hole.
-Five-hole arepas, military style.

58:39.041 --> 58:42.166
To share with our friends from Araracuara.

58:45.416 --> 58:47.416
How's the mambe, Mr. Eliécer?

58:47.500 --> 58:48.625
-Perfect.
-Yeah?

58:52.458 --> 58:55.958
Every day after walking, we analyze.

58:56.625 --> 59:00.166
We wonder if the kids are okay,
how they are.

59:01.333 --> 59:04.000
If they're sick or weak.

59:04.708 --> 59:06.541
Where they could be.

59:07.750 --> 59:10.958
Even if the children were hiding,

59:11.041 --> 59:12.208
they were there.

59:13.416 --> 59:15.833
So why couldn't we find them?

59:18.541 --> 59:20.375
Things happened there

59:21.583 --> 59:23.583
that I have no answer for.

59:26.458 --> 59:31.125
At night, we sometimes felt
that people were walking around us.

59:35.250 --> 59:38.041
It felt like there were things going on

59:38.125 --> 59:41.000
that weren't normal.

59:46.833 --> 59:50.541
We started looking
for the children at night.

59:56.750 --> 59:58.250
Lots of weird things happened.

01:00:03.833 --> 01:00:09.541
The GPS compasses
started spinning rapidly.

01:00:11.541 --> 01:00:13.250
It was scary.

01:00:20.333 --> 01:00:24.125
We didn't know what was happening to us

01:00:25.000 --> 01:00:26.333
or who was there with us.

01:00:34.625 --> 01:00:37.666
Don Rubio said,
"Captain, the duende got you."

01:00:39.916 --> 01:00:41.708
I'm a practicing Catholic.

01:00:41.791 --> 01:00:44.625
I'm a believer in the existence of a God.

01:00:45.958 --> 01:00:49.083
But supernatural things exist.

01:00:49.166 --> 01:00:50.291
No doubt about it.

01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:09.166
We thought that maybe
Mother Earth was taking a stand.

01:01:15.083 --> 01:01:18.583
How many times have we hunted, killed,

01:01:19.875 --> 01:01:22.791
destroyed, and cut down forests?

01:01:22.875 --> 01:01:25.041
Not just us,

01:01:25.125 --> 01:01:29.000
but how many people
do it around the world?

01:01:32.875 --> 01:01:35.666
The jungle was angry.

01:02:06.708 --> 01:02:10.083
I no longer thought we'd find them alive.

01:02:15.291 --> 01:02:17.083
I wanted symbols, signs.

01:02:19.833 --> 01:02:21.125
There was nothing.

01:02:22.666 --> 01:02:27.666
And I decided
we had to relieve our troops.

01:02:46.958 --> 01:02:49.583
There has been no evidence
that the children are alive

01:02:49.666 --> 01:02:50.708
for several days now.

01:02:55.625 --> 01:02:59.833
It's hard to imagine a baby
surviving so long

01:02:59.916 --> 01:03:01.791
in such an inhospitable environment.

01:03:02.916 --> 01:03:06.625
The country is hoping for the best
but preparing for the worst.

01:03:10.958 --> 01:03:16.041
The group wasn't
as big as it was at the start.

01:03:33.541 --> 01:03:35.875
Those were hard times.

01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:43.583
Those poor children…

01:03:51.250 --> 01:03:54.166
were surely dead.

01:04:09.625 --> 01:04:12.291
We had nowhere else to look.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:18.583
After all those days,
the mission had failed.

01:04:43.041 --> 01:04:45.541
I told them, "Brothers, have faith."

01:04:52.875 --> 01:04:56.000
There was one more thing we could try.

01:05:10.666 --> 01:05:12.083
Yagé, the plant of the gods.

01:05:13.875 --> 01:05:18.000
Besides yagé, there was no other solution.

01:05:24.416 --> 01:05:28.291
Yagé is more commonly known as ayahuasca.

01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:31.958
It's like a nuclear weapon for us.

01:05:37.041 --> 01:05:41.125
Yagé would tell us
where the children were.

01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:46.708
I had General Sánchez's number,

01:05:48.083 --> 01:05:51.625
so I called him to ask for a favor.

01:05:58.041 --> 01:06:01.916
The community started preparing the yagé
and praying for us.

01:06:08.958 --> 01:06:10.791
The yagé arrived by helicopter.

01:06:15.166 --> 01:06:18.625
The first attempt was made
with the children's dad.

01:06:36.083 --> 01:06:37.875
That was a waste.

01:06:41.625 --> 01:06:43.750
The jungle rejected Manuel.

01:06:46.125 --> 01:06:47.416
We didn't know why.

01:06:50.625 --> 01:06:53.041
I told him, "It's best that you leave,"

01:06:53.125 --> 01:06:55.625
but there was one dose left.

01:06:55.708 --> 01:06:58.791
So I told Elder Rubio,
"Rubio, tonight it's your turn."

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:04.500
"If you can't make this work,
we're leaving tomorrow."

01:07:12.041 --> 01:07:13.041
It's my turn.

01:07:15.375 --> 01:07:18.000
This is the final showdown.

01:07:19.750 --> 01:07:20.791
Either he takes me

01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:23.250
or I take him.

01:07:31.833 --> 01:07:34.375
Father creator, Yagé,

01:07:34.875 --> 01:07:39.291
tell me directly, where are the children?

01:07:42.791 --> 01:07:44.166
I took it.

01:07:51.041 --> 01:07:53.500
I turned into a jaguar.

01:08:08.083 --> 01:08:14.416
I left the world of darkness.

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.583
Now I am in the world of light.

01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.000
The first one to see me was Henry.

01:09:43.375 --> 01:09:45.125
He asked, "Brother, how did it go?"

01:09:45.916 --> 01:09:47.416
I said, "Good, brother."

01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:50.208
"We're finding the kids
at 3:00 p.m. today."

01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:52.791
He said, "We'll find the kids today."

01:09:57.250 --> 01:10:01.291
I'd already asked for the helicopter
to come pick us up.

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:07.291
Whether we found them or not,
we were leaving.

01:10:07.916 --> 01:10:10.916
Okay, guys, today's the last day.

01:10:12.375 --> 01:10:17.583
Remember to always…
continue with the tobacco.

01:10:19.375 --> 01:10:21.708
Something felt different that day.

01:10:23.416 --> 01:10:25.291
The jungle was at peace.

01:10:29.916 --> 01:10:34.625
Don Rubio instructed me to go northwest.

01:10:37.125 --> 01:10:38.875
"That's where the children are."

01:10:42.291 --> 01:10:44.166
I stayed at the campsite.

01:10:47.833 --> 01:10:49.375
We were just about to leave.

01:10:53.083 --> 01:10:57.750
We were trekking separately,
searching carefully.

01:11:15.666 --> 01:11:18.833
Rescuers started to return
to the campsite.

01:11:21.375 --> 01:11:23.458
We asked each of them how it went.

01:11:23.541 --> 01:11:25.375
They'd say, "No, nothing."

01:11:28.250 --> 01:11:32.250
Our four comrades from Putumayo
hadn't come back yet.

01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:39.208
Just before 2:00 p.m., we sat down again.

01:11:41.083 --> 01:11:43.458
That's when Eliécer said,

01:11:45.291 --> 01:11:47.666
"I'm leaving this place
with grief in my soul."

01:11:48.916 --> 01:11:52.583
I told them,
"As a Putumayo, I'm leaving sad."

01:11:53.916 --> 01:11:57.583
We were climbing a hill
on our way back out.

01:12:02.166 --> 01:12:03.916
The more we trekked,

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.250
the thicker the jungle became.

01:12:10.916 --> 01:12:11.916
When,

01:12:13.416 --> 01:12:14.458
all of a sudden…

01:12:25.083 --> 01:12:28.000
We all stopped in our tracks.

01:12:35.208 --> 01:12:37.083
"Where's it coming from? What is it?"

01:12:42.708 --> 01:12:43.958
Everything fell silent.

01:12:57.833 --> 01:13:00.375
When I raised my head

01:13:00.458 --> 01:13:03.208
to see where my colleagues were,

01:13:04.750 --> 01:13:06.250
I saw the children.

01:13:20.208 --> 01:13:21.375
They seemed scared.

01:13:24.041 --> 01:13:26.333
Like they were looking
for somewhere to run.

01:13:29.375 --> 01:13:34.000
So I raised my arms
and told them, "Family."

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:38.583
God has blessed us.

01:13:38.666 --> 01:13:41.041
Praise God, we found the children.

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:43.791
-Here are the four children.
-The four children are alive.

01:13:43.875 --> 01:13:45.125
-Thank God.
-Thank God.

01:13:45.208 --> 01:13:47.666
Here's the little 11-month-old girl.

01:13:47.750 --> 01:13:49.416
Here's the little 11-month-old girl.

01:14:05.708 --> 01:14:07.541
At that moment, I was like a bird,

01:14:08.458 --> 01:14:11.375
singing something that, to this day,
is still unknown to me

01:14:12.666 --> 01:14:15.000
while I held the baby girl in my arms.

01:14:20.041 --> 01:14:21.583
We had faith in him.

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:25.291
God never fails us
when we ask from the heart.

01:14:37.333 --> 01:14:39.333
And the first thing the boy said…

01:14:41.666 --> 01:14:43.833
"My mom died on the plane."

01:15:01.458 --> 01:15:04.375
If it had taken another two days,

01:15:05.041 --> 01:15:06.208
the boy would've died.

01:15:06.958 --> 01:15:08.416
He was on the brink of death.

01:15:26.875 --> 01:15:27.875
"Okay, guys."

01:15:28.958 --> 01:15:31.583
"There are four children and four of us."

01:15:32.791 --> 01:15:34.583
"One each. Okay now."

01:15:35.583 --> 01:15:36.583
"Let's go."

01:15:46.250 --> 01:15:47.625
We talked the whole way.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.333
Remembering.

01:15:52.416 --> 01:15:55.708
I just wanted her to make a sound.

01:15:57.166 --> 01:15:58.250
I'd say,

01:16:00.541 --> 01:16:02.875
"It took so long. We searched so hard."

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.416
"Now she's here with me."

01:16:28.875 --> 01:16:32.208
After the accident, I don't know
how long I was unconscious for.

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.916
When I woke up, there was a lot of blood,

01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.791
and I had a large cut on my left leg,

01:16:49.875 --> 01:16:52.541
which was very painful.

01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:59.916
I could hear my siblings crying.

01:17:02.583 --> 01:17:04.583
My mother was making noises.

01:17:05.125 --> 01:17:08.125
Then she stopped.

01:17:11.458 --> 01:17:15.125
Maybe if I had woken up before,
I could have saved her.

01:17:22.208 --> 01:17:26.750
I pulled my sister out
from underneath my mother.

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.583
I knew we had to leave the plane

01:17:45.916 --> 01:17:50.250
so we could find more food
and something to drink.

01:17:55.291 --> 01:18:00.333
My leg hurt a lot. I couldn't walk.

01:18:04.333 --> 01:18:08.458
I dragged myself on my knees.

01:18:15.250 --> 01:18:20.333
I did that for the first 20 days.

01:18:32.708 --> 01:18:38.500
My biggest worry
was to keep baby Cristin alive.

01:18:40.666 --> 01:18:44.125
I knew she needed more food than us.

01:18:47.416 --> 01:18:50.875
My mother had taught me
about fruits we could eat in the jungle,

01:18:50.958 --> 01:18:53.500
like milpesos.

01:18:59.625 --> 01:19:03.291
I made a fishing rod.

01:19:07.666 --> 01:19:11.166
We caught some fish.

01:19:16.125 --> 01:19:18.125
We ate it raw.

01:19:20.625 --> 01:19:22.166
It tasted horrible.

01:19:35.500 --> 01:19:38.541
We tried following the voice,

01:19:39.291 --> 01:19:41.166
but it would fade.

01:19:49.916 --> 01:19:54.875
I tried to get my sisters
and my brother to sleep each night.

01:20:10.333 --> 01:20:12.125
I didn't really sleep.

01:20:17.666 --> 01:20:20.541
We almost sat on a snake.

01:20:21.458 --> 01:20:23.750
I killed it with a stick.

01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:36.083
Tien became so weak,
he could no longer stand.

01:20:46.166 --> 01:20:49.708
One day,
I dreamed they would never find us.

01:20:55.041 --> 01:20:59.833
My heart was beating so fast,
I struggled to breathe.

01:21:06.291 --> 01:21:11.958
I got up and decided to leave
my sisters and brother.

01:21:13.375 --> 01:21:16.041
I walked away.

01:21:23.708 --> 01:21:27.833
But after 20 minutes,
I realized I had to go back.

01:21:38.333 --> 01:21:43.125
I knew I had to protect
my brother and my sisters.

01:21:50.583 --> 01:21:55.000
Cristin and Tien were very close to death.

01:22:07.166 --> 01:22:09.958
When I saw the man, I collapsed.

01:22:11.125 --> 01:22:12.208
Family.

01:22:30.208 --> 01:22:35.000
I didn't have to keep
my brother and sisters alive anymore.

01:22:37.083 --> 01:22:40.625
They were safe now.

01:22:48.083 --> 01:22:51.333
We are handing over the children

01:22:51.416 --> 01:22:55.208
to the Colombian military forces.

01:22:55.291 --> 01:22:58.833
We found them
four and a half kilometers away.

01:22:59.416 --> 01:23:02.041
They are now with the army.

01:23:02.541 --> 01:23:05.541
They're giving them medical attention.

01:23:12.666 --> 01:23:16.000
I was on the radio
talking to the commander.

01:23:16.083 --> 01:23:20.958
He told me to hold on.
I remember it so clearly. "Hold on."

01:23:23.333 --> 01:23:25.791
He said,
"It seems they found the children."

01:23:26.291 --> 01:23:27.625
I said, "What?"

01:23:27.708 --> 01:23:29.916
I jumped up and ran.

01:23:31.375 --> 01:23:33.083
We cried.

01:23:36.291 --> 01:23:37.375
We all did.

01:23:38.375 --> 01:23:40.708
I remember we all hugged.

01:23:42.458 --> 01:23:43.541
Everyone.

01:23:46.125 --> 01:23:50.375
The army guys forgot about their weapons.
They dropped them.

01:24:01.291 --> 01:24:02.958
I have good news for you.

01:24:03.041 --> 01:24:07.166
We just found the children.

01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:09.958
Yes, all four of them are alive.

01:24:10.541 --> 01:24:13.208
"They found the children." I said, "What?"

01:24:13.708 --> 01:24:17.000
"Praise the Lord.
They found the children!"

01:24:17.083 --> 01:24:19.708
"Thank God the children are alive."

01:24:20.750 --> 01:24:24.041
"We'll be with them again to mother them."

01:24:41.208 --> 01:24:43.791
The children have been found alive!

01:24:43.875 --> 01:24:46.500
After an intense 40-day search

01:24:46.583 --> 01:24:50.583
and without giving up or losing hope
of finding the four children…

01:24:58.166 --> 01:25:01.500
However, after finding the four children,

01:25:01.583 --> 01:25:04.333
Wilson the dog has yet to be found.

01:25:04.416 --> 01:25:06.166
The dog was not with them.

01:25:09.625 --> 01:25:12.125
I was the first person

01:25:12.208 --> 01:25:15.041
to call General Sánchez
to give him the news.

01:25:15.750 --> 01:25:18.208
"That's incredible. This is a miracle."

01:25:19.208 --> 01:25:21.208
Miracle, miracle, miracle.

01:25:33.583 --> 01:25:35.166
My name is Claudia.

01:25:37.041 --> 01:25:38.625
You're very pretty.

01:25:38.708 --> 01:25:41.958
Okay now, I'll take this off.

01:25:46.375 --> 01:25:48.666
And I said, "It was worth it."

01:25:48.750 --> 01:25:51.500
Our commandos, our brave commandos,

01:25:52.583 --> 01:25:54.625
together with our Indigenous people,

01:25:54.708 --> 01:25:56.875
made the impossible possible.

01:26:03.375 --> 01:26:07.333
Here in Colombia, we are 88% mixed race,

01:26:07.416 --> 01:26:10.291
which means that we have Indigenous blood
in one way or another.

01:26:10.375 --> 01:26:14.708
If we look beyond
our race, creed, or social status,

01:26:14.791 --> 01:26:16.958
we can achieve
anything we set our minds to.

01:26:24.416 --> 01:26:27.083
Well, today we've had a magical day.

01:26:28.166 --> 01:26:30.750
Let's just say it will go down in history.

01:26:32.125 --> 01:26:35.458
Mother Jungle has given them back to us.

01:26:38.375 --> 01:26:41.750
They are children of the jungle,
and now they are children of Colombia.

01:27:56.458 --> 01:28:00.458
I hope that this Operation Hope

01:28:01.416 --> 01:28:05.500
has helped all of Colombia…

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:11.375
understand that we can work together.

01:28:11.458 --> 01:28:12.625
I can assure you,

01:28:12.708 --> 01:28:17.416
I would shed this uniform tomorrow
if it would lead to peace in Colombia.

01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:21.333
I want to leave my daughters
a peaceful place.

01:29:07.666 --> 01:29:11.083
It was a once-in-a-lifetime experience
for everyone.

01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:17.291
For us Indigenous people,

01:29:18.125 --> 01:29:22.875
this search reminded the world
that we exist.

01:29:24.916 --> 01:29:27.416
That we are here to contribute.

01:29:29.083 --> 01:29:34.041
When I took control of the search party,

01:29:34.916 --> 01:29:37.708
frankly, it changed me a lot.

01:29:40.833 --> 01:29:43.750
Even at my age, I can do things like this.

01:29:53.333 --> 01:29:57.041
It gave me a lot of joy
to see the happiness in the family,

01:29:57.791 --> 01:30:02.000
which is a happiness I still don't have.

01:30:05.333 --> 01:30:08.791
But thanks to this mission,
I have a new family.

01:30:11.875 --> 01:30:15.916
So this gives me joy.

01:30:21.250 --> 01:30:24.083
Being able to find the children

01:30:24.916 --> 01:30:28.791
was like finding myself.

01:30:29.541 --> 01:30:32.666
Both they and I were rescued

01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:35.625
with love and respect,

01:30:35.708 --> 01:30:37.958
through the culture

01:30:38.041 --> 01:30:42.875
and the ancient identity
of Indigenous people.

01:30:43.750 --> 01:30:48.291
This and the children make me feel proud.

01:35:11.416 --> 01:35:16.416
