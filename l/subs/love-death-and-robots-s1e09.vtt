WEBVTT

00:37.005 --> 00:38.547
[man] The assholes wouldn't leave.

00:38.630 --> 00:42.838
I had to call the goddamn Sheriff to cart
them and their scrawny fucktard kids away.

00:43.297 --> 00:45.755
Ah, crap! Goddammit.

00:47.255 --> 00:48.088
Fuck!

00:49.088 --> 00:50.755
I don't know, a dead possum.

00:50.838 --> 00:53.338
[flies buzzing]

00:54.380 --> 00:56.463
What a shit hole.

00:57.297 --> 01:01.755
Listen, I gotta go.
Another day, another eviction.

01:06.422 --> 01:08.088
[narrator] <i>This dump's my home.</i>

01:08.672 --> 01:10.130
<i>The only one I ever had.</i>

01:11.463 --> 01:13.963
<i>Some people may not think much of it.</i>

01:14.505 --> 01:18.005
<i>But me and my buddy Otto</i>
<i>like it here just fine.</i>

01:22.172 --> 01:26.047
<i>And the good book says,</i>
<i>"A man's home is his castle</i>

01:26.130 --> 01:31.963
<i>and whosoevereth trespasses shall be</i>
<i>struck down with fire and lightning."</i>

01:32.463 --> 01:37.838
<i>And since I ain't got no lightning,</i>
<i>I tend just to keep it real simple, like.</i>

01:37.922 --> 01:38.922
[gun cocks]

01:40.630 --> 01:44.213
I'm about to blow your head off, fat boy.

01:44.963 --> 01:47.172
Mr. Dvorchack, I presume?

01:48.005 --> 01:49.297
City Inspector.

01:50.130 --> 01:51.130
[grunts]

01:56.130 --> 01:59.422
I've been habitating here
more than 20-odd years now.

01:59.880 --> 02:06.172
And some new high-falutin' sanitation law
don't mean shit to me, Mr. City Inspector.

02:06.713 --> 02:09.255
Oh, but I'm afraid it <i>does </i>mean something

02:09.338 --> 02:11.838
to the owners of the condominiums
they're building next door.

02:11.922 --> 02:14.755
So, you see,
everything in this dump has got to go,

02:14.838 --> 02:16.672
including you, Mr. Dvorchack.

02:16.838 --> 02:18.880
-If you'll just sign these papers--
-[Dvorchack] Otto!

02:19.422 --> 02:21.088
Otto! C'mere, boy!

02:23.213 --> 02:24.713
Oh, dang critter.

02:25.005 --> 02:27.172
Always scrounging for food.

02:27.838 --> 02:32.255
Yeah, I tell you what... how about
we crack a couple of cold beers

02:32.338 --> 02:34.672
while I spin ya a little yarn?

02:34.755 --> 02:37.380
And you still want Otto
and me gone when I'm done,

02:37.463 --> 02:41.588
well, I'll sign whatever you want
and we clear on out.

02:42.088 --> 02:46.130
-Dang lighter!
-I'm a busy man, Mr. Dvorchack.

02:46.213 --> 02:49.422
I don't have time for drunken ramblings
and crazy stories.

02:49.505 --> 02:51.047
If we could just move this--

02:51.130 --> 02:53.463
-One night, couple years back...
-Fuck me.

02:53.547 --> 02:55.547
-...me and my friend Pearly, we...
-[lighter ignites]

02:55.755 --> 02:56.588
Eh?

03:01.130 --> 03:06.338
Me and my friend Pearly were
having a drink and conversatin', like.

03:06.547 --> 03:07.797
[laughs]

03:07.880 --> 03:09.630
Oh, boy, I tell ya.

03:10.422 --> 03:13.713
Hell, you oughta get up off yer duff
and see the world.

03:14.505 --> 03:16.213
Oh, what for?

03:16.297 --> 03:19.213
Everything I need ends up here eventually.

03:19.297 --> 03:21.755
Oh, yeah? What about women?

03:21.838 --> 03:23.963
I don't see no women round here.

03:24.297 --> 03:25.630
Pearly, she's right there.

03:26.255 --> 03:28.713
Oh, sorry. No offense, Betty.

03:29.797 --> 03:31.505
But I am telling you, boy.

03:31.588 --> 03:36.213
Down in Laredo, they got these
river trash whores. Oh, boy!

03:36.297 --> 03:37.297
[laughing]

03:37.380 --> 03:40.130
They can suck the chrome
off a trailer hitch.

03:40.297 --> 03:41.838
-[metal clangs]
-Hey, you hear that?

03:42.130 --> 03:44.922
It's just rats. Tell me about the whores.

03:45.338 --> 03:48.713
Hold your horses a minute.
My back teeth are floating.

03:56.213 --> 03:57.922
[Pearly] Come on out, ya little monster.

03:58.005 --> 03:58.838
[chuckles]

03:59.880 --> 04:01.255
Yeah, boy.

[gun shot]

04:34.963 --> 04:36.713
Don't shoot the rats!

04:37.088 --> 04:39.463
-It's good company.
-[multiple gun shots]

04:39.547 --> 04:41.630
What in tarnation?

04:43.963 --> 04:45.422
[panting heavily]

04:45.588 --> 04:47.755
We gotta get the hell outta Dodge!

04:47.838 --> 04:50.047
-There's something out there?
-What the hell is it?

04:50.130 --> 04:51.297
[metal crashing]

04:51.380 --> 04:52.297
It's coming.

04:56.047 --> 04:57.255
What is it?

04:57.338 --> 05:00.338
Damned if I know! It's eyes everywhere!

05:00.588 --> 05:03.255
All manner of crap stickin' out of it.

05:03.797 --> 05:05.255
It's all shiny and wet.

05:06.338 --> 05:07.255
[Pearly yelps]

05:14.380 --> 05:16.088
[gulps] My balls!

Aargh! Help me!

05:20.755 --> 05:22.588
[gargled scream]

05:23.380 --> 05:24.547
I don't wanna go!

05:24.630 --> 05:26.005
Let go, Pearly!

05:26.672 --> 05:28.130
I can't shoot!

05:28.630 --> 05:29.755

05:56.172 --> 05:58.380
Give my friend back, motherfucker!

06:01.297 --> 06:03.297
I'ma get you, you son of a bitch.

[cackles]

06:50.422 --> 06:51.380
[howls]

06:51.463 --> 06:52.713
What in the shit?

06:53.963 --> 06:55.963
[howling]

06:57.755 --> 06:59.755
[reverse gear beeping]

07:11.297 --> 07:13.088
Now fuck me ragged.

07:13.172 --> 07:14.505
-[whimpers]
-A puppy.

07:16.755 --> 07:18.047
[groaning]

07:19.963 --> 07:23.047
[Dvorchack] <i>And that's when a </i>
<i>big old light bulb went off in my head.</i>

07:23.547 --> 07:28.297
<i>This here monster wasn't just created</i>
<i>by all the heat and garbage.</i>

07:28.380 --> 07:29.755
<i>It lived off it.</i>

07:30.838 --> 07:34.880
<i>And whatever it ate became a part of it.</i>

07:39.547 --> 07:40.547
[incoming message alert]

07:41.380 --> 07:42.463
[Inspector laughs]

07:42.547 --> 07:45.172
They're gonna love this one
back at the office.

07:45.963 --> 07:47.047
Sorry.

07:47.505 --> 07:49.588
So, you were saying about Curly?

07:50.338 --> 07:52.630
His name was Pearly.

07:53.713 --> 07:54.755
Right.

07:54.838 --> 07:58.797
And it's an absolutely riveting tale,
Mr. Dvorchack,

07:58.880 --> 08:03.130
but I can actually feel myself
getting septic shock sitting here.

08:03.213 --> 08:06.255
So, if you'll just make a big X
on those papers,

08:06.338 --> 08:08.588
I can finally get out of this shit hole.

08:08.880 --> 08:11.630
Otto! There you are, boy!

08:12.630 --> 08:13.713
[creature growls]

08:14.088 --> 08:15.713
[metal clanging]

08:19.755 --> 08:21.505
What? [screams]

08:21.922 --> 08:22.755
No!

08:24.547 --> 08:25.755
No!

08:26.797 --> 08:28.505
Mr. Dvorchack!

08:28.880 --> 08:30.755
[screaming]

08:38.630 --> 08:40.588
Yep. The way I see it...

08:41.755 --> 08:46.422
you hang around a dump long enough
and the world comes to you.

08:47.172 --> 08:48.213
Ain't that right, Otto?

08:48.297 --> 08:49.713
[screams]

08:55.963 --> 08:57.380
[Dvorchack laughs]

08:58.005 --> 09:00.130
[whistles] Here, boy!

09:00.672 --> 09:01.797
Attaboy!

09:01.880 --> 09:04.505
[Dvorchack] <i>Yes, sir, the dump's my home.</i>

09:05.088 --> 09:07.838
<i>The best damn home I've ever had.</i>
