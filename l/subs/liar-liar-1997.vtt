00:51.244 --> 00:54.831
W... O...

00:54.914 --> 00:56.833
R...

00:56.916 --> 00:58.835
K...

00:58.918 --> 01:00.920
Work.

01:01.629 --> 01:05.967
Today we're going to share
what our parents do for...

01:06.051 --> 01:09.012
Work!

01:09.054 --> 01:11.222
My mommy is a doctor.

01:11.306 --> 01:14.684
- My daddy is a truck driver.
- My mom's a teacher.

01:14.768 --> 01:19.564
- And your dad?
- Mmm. My dad...

01:19.647 --> 01:23.318
He's... a liar.

01:23.359 --> 01:28.239
A... A liar? Oh, I'm sure
you don't mean a liar.

01:28.323 --> 01:32.118
Well, he wears a suit and goes
to court and talks to the judge.

01:32.160 --> 01:34.537
Oh! I see.

01:34.621 --> 01:36.915
You mean he's a lawyer.

01:43.463 --> 01:45.382
Hey, Fletcher.
How'd it go?

01:45.465 --> 01:48.510
- Just another victory for the wrongly accused.
- Yeah, right.

01:48.551 --> 01:51.513
- Mr. Reede, great job.
Do you want your coat back?

01:51.554 --> 01:54.057
No, I'm sure you'll be
needing it again and again.

01:54.140 --> 01:57.685
- Do you have a moment?
- I'm late. It's my day to be with my son.

01:57.769 --> 02:00.688
A couple of reporters want
to talk about your big win.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.816
Yeah? How's my hair?

02:02.857 --> 02:04.818
Fabulous.
You look great.

02:20.125 --> 02:25.130
- What time is it?
- I am sure your dad just got held up in court again.

02:31.886 --> 02:35.640
- Dad!
- Maximilian!

02:39.102 --> 02:42.313
Hey, how ya doin', creep?

02:42.397 --> 02:44.357
Good.

02:44.399 --> 02:48.987
Me too, except my arm
has been botherin' me.

02:49.070 --> 02:51.364
- Oh, no, Dad!
- Oh, yeah.

02:51.406 --> 02:54.325
It's becoming a claw!

02:57.370 --> 03:00.957
Nothing can stop the claw!

03:03.793 --> 03:08.173
Run, boy, run!
Save yourself!

03:08.256 --> 03:10.759
Do the claw to Mom!
Do the claw to Mom!

03:10.842 --> 03:14.429
Uh-oh. You found
the claw's only weakness.

03:14.512 --> 03:17.474
Subzero temperatures!

03:17.557 --> 03:21.186
- So, did you have any trouble
finding the place?

03:21.269 --> 03:24.814
Okay, I'm late. I'm sorry.
I ran out of gas.

03:24.898 --> 03:29.194
The gauge is broken.
Rough neighborhood too.

03:29.277 --> 03:31.362
Good thing I was wearin'
neutral gang colors.

03:31.446 --> 03:34.074
I might have had to pull out
my nine and bust a cap.

03:34.115 --> 03:36.368
My mind and my money
and my money and my mind

03:36.451 --> 03:40.288
- They would never hurt you,
Fletcher. You're their lawyer.

03:40.372 --> 03:43.708
That was below the belt.
Keep the gloves up.

03:43.792 --> 03:46.711
Mom, Dad's taking me
to see wrestling!

03:46.795 --> 03:49.672
- Oh, Fletcher!
- Oh, Audrey!

03:49.756 --> 03:52.675
Why do you have to take him
to see that stuff? It's very violent.

03:52.759 --> 03:57.347
The boy must grow
to be a warrior.

03:57.430 --> 03:59.391
Who better to guide him
than Rick Rude...

03:59.474 --> 04:02.894
and Randy Macho-man Savage
in the cage of death?

04:05.146 --> 04:07.190
Oh, good!

04:07.273 --> 04:10.985
- Jerry, how's it goin'?
- Hey, gipper!

04:11.027 --> 04:13.405
You look like you grow
by the minute!

04:13.488 --> 04:16.324
Fletcher, pleasure to see you.
Hi, honey!

04:16.408 --> 04:18.827
Hi.

04:18.910 --> 04:22.664
Wow. That was a nice image.
Deleted.

04:24.249 --> 04:26.584
- I have some more boxes for you.
- Oh, you're an angel.

04:26.668 --> 04:31.506
- Boxes? - Remember, I told you a few weeks ago,
Jerry's moving to Boston.

04:31.548 --> 04:36.094
Oh, right! The job, the thing.
What do you do again?

04:36.177 --> 04:39.597
- Hospital administrator.
- Right, right!

04:39.681 --> 04:41.599
Well, the boxes
are in my car.

04:41.683 --> 04:43.601
Oh, those can wait.

04:43.685 --> 04:46.646
I made this young man
a promise, didn't I?

04:46.688 --> 04:48.732
- Got time to throw a few?
- Sure!

04:48.815 --> 04:51.317
Come on, then!

04:51.359 --> 04:53.820
- I forgot the boyfriend was moving.
- Jerry!

04:53.862 --> 04:57.032
His name is Jerry!
And yes, he's moving.

04:57.115 --> 05:00.535
I'm sorry. I hated him less
than your other boyfriends.

05:00.618 --> 05:03.413
- It wasn't serious, was it?
- Semiserious, yes.

05:03.496 --> 05:07.250
You guys aren't...
You know...

05:09.878 --> 05:12.756
I have been
dating him for seven months.

05:12.839 --> 05:15.550
- What do you think?
- Really? Ooh!

05:15.592 --> 05:18.636
I was hoping after being married
to me you'd have no strength left.

05:18.720 --> 05:22.724
Remember, when we were married, I wasn't
having sex nearly as often as you were.

05:22.807 --> 05:27.312
Ouch! And the ref
takes a point away.

05:27.395 --> 05:31.733
- Out!
- Max is gonna miss him.

05:31.816 --> 05:33.777
I'll be here.

05:33.860 --> 05:37.781
Ready? Yeah! Play ball.

05:37.864 --> 05:40.992
Max, come on. We've gotta go.

05:41.076 --> 05:45.038
- Dad, are we really going to wrestling?
- Absolutely, Max Factor.

05:45.080 --> 05:47.415
We just have to stop by
the office for one minute.

05:47.457 --> 05:49.501
Excuse me, sir. Any spare change?

05:49.584 --> 05:51.586
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm all out.

05:51.628 --> 05:53.713
I can't do it.

05:53.755 --> 05:57.675
Fred, it's your duty to present
the strongest case possible.

05:57.759 --> 06:00.678
The strongest case possible
consistent with the truth.

06:00.762 --> 06:02.764
Will you let the judge
decide what's true?

06:02.847 --> 06:06.601
That's what he gets paid for.
You get paid to win.

06:06.643 --> 06:08.978
If you insist
that I take it to trial,

06:09.062 --> 06:12.732
I will represent Mrs. Cole
aggressively and ethically.

06:12.857 --> 06:15.026
But Miranda, I won't lie.

06:17.070 --> 06:20.156
Then we'll just have
to find someone who will.

06:22.242 --> 06:24.619
Twenty-first floor.
Men's wear.

06:29.040 --> 06:31.251
- Hi, Mr. Reede!
- Whoa!

06:31.334 --> 06:35.463
Hey. Did you do something
to your hair?

06:35.505 --> 06:37.340
It's a bit extreme,
isn't it?

06:37.424 --> 06:41.094
No! That's the thing nowadays, right?

06:41.177 --> 06:44.597
- He said it would accent my facial features.
- That's what it does!

06:44.681 --> 06:47.475
It completely accents
your facial features.

06:47.517 --> 06:51.938
We're just gonna go
to my office...

06:53.815 --> 06:56.359
- Hey, Fletcher.
- Hey, Pete.

06:56.484 --> 06:58.862
- You losin' a little weight?
- I don't know. Maybe.

06:58.987 --> 07:01.448
Looks and personality.
A double-threat guy.

07:01.573 --> 07:03.950
- Hey, Mr. Reede.
- Hey... man.

07:04.034 --> 07:06.077
- It's, uh, Randy.
- Yeah, I know.

07:06.161 --> 07:09.247
Takin' lunch orders.
Anything?

07:09.330 --> 07:11.374
No, thanks.

07:11.458 --> 07:14.878
I had so much for breakfast,
I'm ready to pop.

07:14.961 --> 07:19.215
- I mean, I'm full.
- Okay. Great.

07:23.303 --> 07:26.139
- Max!
- Hi, Greta.

07:26.181 --> 07:30.894
- Hey, what's new?
- It's my birthday tomorrow, and we're having a party.

07:31.019 --> 07:34.355
Wow! I am sure your daddy
has got you something wonderful.

07:34.439 --> 07:40.028
- Yeah?
- Yeah, you bet! Listen, kiddo.

07:40.111 --> 07:44.407
Why don't you play in my office for a minute.
Sue somebody for everything they've got.

07:44.532 --> 07:48.745
Maybe you can send a fax
to one of your girlfriends. Hey, sorry.

07:48.870 --> 07:52.707
Damn it!
I completely forgot.

07:52.832 --> 07:54.793
Oh, what a surprise.

07:54.876 --> 07:57.545
You are a saint.
I should buy you a gift.

07:57.587 --> 08:01.633
- You did.
- I always do the classy thing. Any calls?

08:01.716 --> 08:04.719
- The Drawlings' clerk needs your filing.
- Tell him it's in the mail.

08:04.761 --> 08:09.682
Right. You'll do it next week. Mr. McKinley
phoned to confirm your meeting tomorrow.

08:09.808 --> 08:12.811
Strep throat. Some kind of virus.
What's goin' around?

08:12.894 --> 08:15.021
- Asian flu?
- Good one.

08:15.063 --> 08:17.732
- And your mother called.
- I'm on vacation.

08:17.774 --> 08:20.193
- It's your fifth week.
- Snowed in. Phones are down.

08:20.276 --> 08:22.695
Break mother's heart.
Done. That's it.

08:22.821 --> 08:25.740
Except Miranda's looking for you.

08:25.865 --> 08:30.412
How much ass do I have to kiss
to make partner?

08:30.453 --> 08:35.041
- Tell her I broke my leg and I had to be shot.
- Tell her yourself.

08:35.125 --> 08:39.254
And then send out a notice
of judgement on my win today!

08:39.295 --> 08:44.551
- I'll get right on it.
- Miranda! Hey, I didn't see you.

08:44.634 --> 08:47.053
You look beautiful today.

08:47.178 --> 08:49.681
Here! I bought you a gift.

08:49.764 --> 08:53.601
Oh, thanks. I heard about
your victory. Congratulations.

08:53.727 --> 08:57.230
You're making quite an impression
on the partnership committee.

08:58.481 --> 09:01.860
That's right!
You folks are meetin' soon.

09:01.943 --> 09:04.237
I've been so busy,
I haven't even thought about it.

09:07.741 --> 09:10.326
Anyway. I have a client
in my office.

09:10.452 --> 09:15.415
- Better not keep him waiting.
- Actually, something rather important's just come up.

09:15.498 --> 09:18.668
Um, you're not busy tonight, are you?

09:25.842 --> 09:27.969
We're not going, are we?

09:41.941 --> 09:45.820
Audrey. You know how there are
moments you know are critical?

09:45.945 --> 09:48.948
- Mm-hmm.
- And choices that have to be made...

09:49.032 --> 09:52.452
- upon which all one's future
happiness will depend? - Mm-hmm.

09:52.535 --> 09:54.496
This is one of those moments.

09:56.331 --> 09:59.918
What are you
trying to say?

09:59.959 --> 10:02.420
Will you marry me?

10:05.965 --> 10:10.095
- You're moving.
- I know, but I want you and Max to come with me.

10:10.136 --> 10:12.305
Audrey, I've been giving this
a lot of thought.

10:12.347 --> 10:15.308
You know I'm not prone to wild
flights of romantic fancy.

10:15.392 --> 10:19.771
- Mmm.
- But the thought of you and I together just makes sense.

10:19.813 --> 10:22.690
Now I'm ready. I think
you're ready. I love Max.

10:22.774 --> 10:25.068
You love Max.
It's right. It fits.

10:26.277 --> 10:28.738
So what do you say?

10:46.005 --> 10:49.509
Hey, creepy.
Happy birthday.

10:49.592 --> 10:51.511
How old are you now,
22 or 23?

10:51.594 --> 10:55.056
- I'm five, Dad.
- Okay.

10:55.140 --> 10:57.726
Return the beer keg.

10:57.809 --> 11:00.937
Cancel the dancing girls.

11:01.020 --> 11:03.982
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

11:04.023 --> 11:06.609
I feel completely unprepared
for this.

11:06.693 --> 11:09.529
You see, I bought you a present,
but last night...

11:09.571 --> 11:12.866
I accidentally swallowed it.

11:12.949 --> 11:15.660
- Dad, it's in your belly!
- Scalpel.

11:16.745 --> 11:18.705
I hope it's not
partially digested!

11:18.747 --> 11:21.249
Ooh! Look out!

11:21.332 --> 11:24.002
- Cool! What is it?
- Cool!

11:24.044 --> 11:27.756
It's... It's a surprise.

11:27.839 --> 11:29.758
All right, it's a pony.
Just open it!

11:31.217 --> 11:34.554
I'm gonna help,
'cause I can't stand it!

11:36.097 --> 11:39.434
- Baseball stuff!
- Baseball stuff!

11:39.517 --> 11:42.228
Cool! Can we play?

11:42.312 --> 11:46.024
I'll be Nomo. You can be
Jose Canseco. Can we play?

11:46.066 --> 11:48.568
- Absolutely.
- Yeah!

11:48.610 --> 11:52.530
Right after your party
tonight, we'll do it.

11:52.572 --> 11:55.241
You and me.

11:55.325 --> 11:58.620
I just have to really
concentrate on this right now.

12:21.601 --> 12:24.104
Hi!

12:24.187 --> 12:27.357
Hey! Happy birthday.

12:27.440 --> 12:31.111
- Thanks, Mom.
- Happy birthday, Max!

12:31.152 --> 12:35.907
One, two, three, four, five.
And one for good luck!

12:35.949 --> 12:37.992
He struck the child.
Did you see that?

12:38.076 --> 12:41.621
- Look at what Dad got me!
- Whoa! Great!

12:41.663 --> 12:44.666
Hey, I have my glove
in the car.

12:44.749 --> 12:48.128
Maybe we can stop at the park
on the way home and play catch.

12:48.169 --> 12:51.715
Then tonight we can rub oil in it
and wrap a big rubber band around it.

12:51.798 --> 12:54.551
It'll be great.
Hey, great gift, Dad!

12:54.634 --> 12:58.888
Thanks, son. I'm so glad my gift
could bring those two together.

12:58.972 --> 13:01.975
My plan to phase myself out
is almost complete.

13:03.309 --> 13:05.478
Something's come up,
and we need to talk.

13:05.520 --> 13:07.814
Come on, Mom.
I want to go play!

13:07.897 --> 13:11.025
And actually it's kind of important,
so maybe we could talk tonight?

13:11.109 --> 13:13.194
- Tonight?
- Yes.

13:13.278 --> 13:16.322
- Max's birthday party.
- Oh! Yeah.

13:16.364 --> 13:18.867
Sure. Of course.
We'll talk then. Great!

13:21.578 --> 13:24.289
- Maximus! I'm outta here.
- Bye, Dad.

13:24.330 --> 13:26.750
Jerry, enjoy my wife.

13:38.678 --> 13:40.263
Hmm.

13:42.682 --> 13:45.226
Well, this is good.

13:45.310 --> 13:47.687
This is really smart.

13:47.729 --> 13:49.689
- Thank you.
- Only...

13:49.731 --> 13:54.277
Well, it's not true.
Does that present a problem?

13:55.945 --> 13:57.864
Mrs. Cole,
the only problem here...

13:57.947 --> 14:01.701
is that after you've provided years
of faithful service and loving support,

14:01.743 --> 14:03.953
of raising his children...
they are his?

14:04.037 --> 14:08.249
Huh? Oh. Yeah, yeah.
One for sure.

14:09.793 --> 14:12.212
After all that, your husband
wants to deny you...

14:12.253 --> 14:16.633
- a fair share of the assets based on one act
of indiscretion. - Seven.

14:16.716 --> 14:20.845
- Pardon me?
- Seven single acts of indiscretion.

14:22.055 --> 14:23.973
Seven acts of indiscretion,

14:24.057 --> 14:26.351
only one of which he has
any evidence of...

14:26.393 --> 14:29.979
and all of which he himself
is responsible for.

14:30.063 --> 14:33.316
- He is?
- Mrs. Cole.

14:33.400 --> 14:37.237
You're the victim here.
The wife of a cold, distant workaholic.

14:37.278 --> 14:39.948
Starved for affection, driven
into the arms of another man!

14:40.031 --> 14:41.991
- Seven.
- Yeah, whatever!

14:42.075 --> 14:44.244
You're not trying to deny him
what is rightfully his.

14:44.327 --> 14:47.789
- All you're insisting on is what is rightfully yours.
- Yeah.

14:47.872 --> 14:50.875
And maybe a...
fraction more.

14:50.917 --> 14:53.420
I think you're
bending over backwards.

14:53.503 --> 14:58.383
Yeah. I did offer to
give him joint custody of the kids.

14:58.425 --> 15:01.594
He is, after all,
a wonderful father.

15:01.636 --> 15:04.848
And how does he repay you?

15:04.931 --> 15:07.267
By dragging you through
a painful litigation process!

15:07.308 --> 15:10.937
No, no, no, no!
This can't happen!

15:11.020 --> 15:14.733
With all due respect, this isn't
about you and Mr. Cole anymore.

15:14.774 --> 15:16.776
This is about all women.

15:16.818 --> 15:20.280
Where would Tina Turner be
right now if she'd rolled over and said,

15:20.321 --> 15:23.616
"Hit me again, Ike,
and put some stank on it?"

15:23.658 --> 15:25.827
Rollin' on the river,
that's where she'd be.

15:25.910 --> 15:29.956
But she's beyond Thunderdome,
because she decided to send a message.

15:29.998 --> 15:34.919
Wake up, sisters!
There's no-o-o-o-o-o...

15:34.961 --> 15:38.631
such thing as a weaker sex!

15:38.673 --> 15:42.218
You know what?

15:42.302 --> 15:46.973
You're right, Mr. Reede. I am
tired of getting kicked around!

15:47.015 --> 15:49.642
Good for you!

15:49.726 --> 15:53.855
Thank you.
I am so grateful...

15:53.938 --> 15:56.858
to have an attorney
I can trust.

16:03.615 --> 16:05.533
Oh, you are good.

16:05.617 --> 16:10.372
You are very, very good.

16:10.455 --> 16:14.417
The Cole case is worth
a truckload of money to this firm.

16:14.501 --> 16:17.754
If you win, I guarantee
you'll make partner.

16:17.837 --> 16:20.507
Aw.

16:20.548 --> 16:24.677
In fact, how would you
like to make...

16:24.719 --> 16:27.222
a partner right now, hmm?

16:27.305 --> 16:30.850
Oh, I don't know.
I should...

16:30.892 --> 16:33.686
Mmm.

16:37.357 --> 16:40.026
Happy, happy, happy
happy, happy, happy

16:40.110 --> 16:44.739
Happy
I'm so happy today

16:44.823 --> 16:48.201
- I live in the U.S.A.
- So honey?

16:48.284 --> 16:50.704
Have you, uh,
thought about...

16:50.745 --> 16:55.542
- You know, what we talked about?
- Uh, yeah. I can't go.

16:55.583 --> 16:57.544
What? Wh-Why not?

16:57.585 --> 17:01.131
- Because of Max.
- But he'll love it there.

17:01.214 --> 17:03.258
I'm gonna take him
to Fenway Park.

17:03.341 --> 17:05.301
There's hiking
and camping...

17:05.385 --> 17:09.222
Well, really,
it's... Fletcher.

17:09.264 --> 17:12.058
Fletcher?
Come on, honey.

17:12.142 --> 17:14.394
He wouldn't even come over
unless you reminded him.

17:14.436 --> 17:17.063
I know, but when he does
come over, Max is so happy.

17:17.147 --> 17:19.607
It's like they have their
own little world together.

17:19.691 --> 17:23.570
- The gipper and I have that too!
- I know, but it's different.

17:23.653 --> 17:26.281
- How?
- Well...

17:27.365 --> 17:29.284
He does the claw.

17:29.367 --> 17:32.287
- The what?
- The claw.

17:32.370 --> 17:35.415
You know, it's like this...

17:35.457 --> 17:37.709
I don't...

17:37.751 --> 17:42.589
Run for you life.
It's the claw! The claw!

17:42.672 --> 17:44.591
Mmm.

17:47.427 --> 17:49.763
I can't really do it that good.
That's not the point.

17:49.846 --> 17:52.098
The point is...

17:52.182 --> 17:54.642
if they're 3,000 miles apart,
they're never gonna see each other.

17:54.726 --> 17:56.644
Fletcher's never gonna
come to Boston.

17:56.728 --> 18:00.273
Hello.

18:00.315 --> 18:03.360
- Audrey?
- Fletcher! Where are you?

18:03.443 --> 18:05.779
We're waiting. Max won't cut the cake
until you get here.

18:05.820 --> 18:08.782
Um... Oh, man!

18:08.865 --> 18:11.368
Actually, something
has come up. I've...

18:11.451 --> 18:13.620
I've got this problem
on a new case.

18:13.661 --> 18:15.622
- What happened?
- Nothing!

18:15.663 --> 18:17.957
I stubbed my toe
on the desk!

18:17.999 --> 18:21.878
I'm really sorry,
but I just can't make it.

18:21.961 --> 18:25.298
The boss is, uh,
really ridin' me.

18:25.382 --> 18:28.009
Fletcher, it's his birthday!

18:28.093 --> 18:30.011
I know, I know.

18:30.095 --> 18:33.681
I'll make it up to him, I promise. I'll
pick him up from school tomorrow, okay?

18:33.765 --> 18:35.892
- You're gonna pick him up?
- Yes!

18:35.975 --> 18:38.853
All right, hold on a minute.
You can say happy birthday.

18:38.937 --> 18:41.314
No! Gotta go! Good-bye.

18:42.941 --> 18:44.859
Hello.

18:45.235 --> 18:48.947
Happy birthday to you

18:48.988 --> 18:54.160
Happy birthday, dear Max

18:54.202 --> 18:59.541
Happy birthday to you

19:01.084 --> 19:04.337
Okay, birthday boy.
Make a wish.

19:06.840 --> 19:10.260
Come on, Max.
It can be anything you want.

19:10.343 --> 19:12.429
Anything in the whole world.

19:27.110 --> 19:29.779
Max.

19:29.863 --> 19:33.116
Your father is sorry.
He had to work.

19:33.199 --> 19:35.744
He said he was gonna
be here. He promised.

19:35.827 --> 19:40.165
I know, but he promises that
he is gonna see you tomorrow.

19:40.206 --> 19:44.252
Okay? He's gonna pick you up
from school. All right?

19:47.213 --> 19:50.800
So come on.
Make a wish.

20:02.937 --> 20:05.398
I wish that for only one day...

20:05.440 --> 20:09.444
Dad couldn't tell a lie.

20:35.345 --> 20:39.849
Mmm. That was incredible.

20:39.933 --> 20:43.186
Was it good for you?

20:43.269 --> 20:45.397
I've had better.

20:52.862 --> 20:54.739
"I've had better"?

20:58.284 --> 21:00.745
"I've had better"?

21:05.291 --> 21:07.168
"I've had better. "

21:30.775 --> 21:33.153
- Hi.
- Hi.

21:33.278 --> 21:36.448
- New in the building?
- Yeah, I just moved in Monday.

21:36.573 --> 21:40.785
- Oh! You like it so far?
- Everybody's been real nice.

21:40.910 --> 21:43.455
Well, that's because
you have big jugs.

21:43.580 --> 21:46.124
I mean, your boobs
are huge.

21:46.249 --> 21:49.836
I mean, I wanna
squeeze 'em.

21:49.961 --> 21:53.757
Mama.

22:04.225 --> 22:06.686
- Any change, mister?
- Absolutely.

22:06.811 --> 22:09.105
- Could you spare some?
- Yes, I could.

22:09.189 --> 22:11.733
- Will ya? How come?
- Mm-mm.

22:11.858 --> 22:14.319
Because I believe
you will buy booze with it!

22:14.402 --> 22:19.240
I just wanna get to the office without being
confronted by the decay of Western society!

22:19.366 --> 22:21.576
Plus, I'm cheap!

22:22.702 --> 22:24.621
Jerk off!

22:55.652 --> 22:57.570
You look like you're
having a rough morning.

22:57.696 --> 23:01.449
Ding, ding, ding!
What do we have for her, Johnny?

23:02.826 --> 23:05.203
- Fletcher.
- Dana.

23:05.328 --> 23:08.581
All right, Samantha. How much
will it take to put an end to all this?

23:08.665 --> 23:12.752
- Fifty percent of your estate.
- Fifty percent?

23:12.836 --> 23:16.214
With a pre-nup and proof of adultery?
What's your case?

23:16.339 --> 23:18.591
Our case is simply this.

23:23.680 --> 23:26.391
B... M...

23:26.474 --> 23:28.393
N-n-n-n...

23:30.270 --> 23:32.605
H-h-h-h...

23:32.689 --> 23:35.442
I-I-I-I-I...

23:35.525 --> 23:37.569
Mmm.

23:37.610 --> 23:39.571
Uh...

24:00.633 --> 24:02.802
Very funny, Fletcher!

24:02.886 --> 24:06.681
You wanna play hardball?
I'm game.

24:06.765 --> 24:09.517
You wanna play hardball? I'm game.

24:09.601 --> 24:12.270
What are you doing?
What is wrong with you?

24:12.312 --> 24:16.649
All rise for the Honorable
Judge Marshall Stevens.

24:16.733 --> 24:18.735
Honorable?

24:19.903 --> 24:25.408
Good morning.
Call case number BD-09395.

24:25.450 --> 24:28.328
Samantha Cole vs. Richard Cole.

24:28.411 --> 24:31.331
- How are we doing this morning, Counsel?
- Fine. Thank you.

24:31.414 --> 24:36.628
- And you, Mr. Reede?
- I'm a little upset about a bad sexual episode last night.

24:40.256 --> 24:43.802
Well, you're still young.
It'll happen more and more.

24:43.843 --> 24:48.348
In the meantime, what do you say
we get down to business?

24:48.431 --> 24:53.144
- First, Mr. Reede, I see...
- I would like a continuance!

24:53.186 --> 24:57.399
This case has been delayed
several times, Mr. Reede.

24:57.482 --> 25:02.821
I realize that, Your Honor, but I would
really, really like a continuance.

25:02.862 --> 25:05.532
I'll have to hear
good cause, Counsel.

25:05.615 --> 25:07.534
What's the problem?

25:17.001 --> 25:20.004
I can't lie!

25:20.088 --> 25:24.843
Commendable, Mr. Reede, but I'm waiting
to hear good cause. Do you have one or not?

25:24.884 --> 25:28.054
- Not.
- Motion for continuance denied.

25:28.138 --> 25:31.015
Is there any chance
of a settlement in this case?

25:31.099 --> 25:36.020
I don't think so, Your Honor.

25:36.062 --> 25:40.900
- But Mr. Reede has made it clear he has no desire...
- Settle!

25:40.984 --> 25:44.362
- Settle, settle, settle, settle!
- I don't want to settle.

25:44.446 --> 25:48.700
Mr. Reede. You convinced me
yesterday, I'm the victim!

25:48.742 --> 25:52.871
I'm starved for affection.
I'm driven into the arms of another man.

25:52.912 --> 25:54.998
- Seven!
- Yeah, whatever.

25:55.040 --> 25:58.126
With the story you came up with,
I don't think we can lose.

25:58.209 --> 26:02.547
- I want to proceed.
- Mrs. Cole, you don't understand.

26:02.589 --> 26:05.050
Mr. Reede.
Do we have a settlement?

26:05.133 --> 26:07.093
No!

26:11.473 --> 26:14.184
- No, Your Honor.
- There's no settlement.

26:14.225 --> 26:17.228
Trial to commence 1:30 sharp.

26:36.164 --> 26:38.083
It was me!

26:41.628 --> 26:44.089
Hi, Mr. Reede!
Like the new dress?

26:44.130 --> 26:48.885
Whatever takes the focus
off your head.

26:48.927 --> 26:53.973
- What's up, Fletcher?
- Your cholesterol, fatty! Dead man walkin'.

26:54.057 --> 26:56.267
- Hey, Fletcher.
- Hey! You're not important enough to remember.

26:56.351 --> 26:59.270
- What's it gonna be, Mr. Reede?
- A pockmark, eventually!

26:59.312 --> 27:02.774
Don't ask!
For God's sakes, don't ask.

27:02.816 --> 27:05.610
All right.
You can beat this.

27:05.694 --> 27:08.571
It's all a matter
of willpower!

27:08.613 --> 27:12.117
A test. Something small.

27:17.872 --> 27:22.585
Red. Red. All right?
Now focus.

27:22.627 --> 27:26.172
The color of this pen
is r-r-r...

27:29.134 --> 27:31.469
The color of this pen...

27:31.553 --> 27:34.472
is re-e-e-e-e...

27:34.514 --> 27:36.599
Re-e-e-e...

27:39.853 --> 27:43.982
The color of the pen
that I hold in my hand...

27:44.024 --> 27:46.985
is r-r-r-r...

27:47.027 --> 27:48.987
r-r-royal blue!

27:52.490 --> 27:55.493
One lie, and I can't say it!

27:56.661 --> 27:58.580
I'll write it.

28:26.024 --> 28:29.235
Write it! Write it,
or I'll break it off!

28:34.657 --> 28:38.703
Agh! No!
Come on! Stop it.

28:49.339 --> 28:51.800
Boss? What happened?

28:56.346 --> 28:59.766
The pen is blue.
The pen is blue!

28:59.849 --> 29:03.520
The goddamn pen is blue!

29:06.064 --> 29:07.982
Mr. Reede, are you all right?

29:08.066 --> 29:11.778
- I gotta go home.
- Home? Was the case settled?

29:11.861 --> 29:14.572
No! I have to be
in court at 1:30!

29:14.656 --> 29:19.577
- Then how are you going to go home?
- I don't know. I don't know.

29:19.619 --> 29:23.665
Okay. Uh, Mr. Reede,
Reuben and Dunn called.

29:23.748 --> 29:26.334
They need to know where the
Darby settlement offer stands.

29:26.418 --> 29:30.714
I just proposed a settlement
to dick with them!

29:32.006 --> 29:34.175
Dick with them.
Got it.

29:34.259 --> 29:38.430
- And your mother called. Are you still on vacation?
- No.

29:38.471 --> 29:40.765
- Then you're here?
- Yes.

29:40.807 --> 29:43.268
Thank you for clearing
that up, sir.

29:43.309 --> 29:46.646
And your ex-wife called. She wants to know
when you're coming to pick up your son.

29:46.730 --> 29:51.026
Oh, I'm such a shit!

29:54.904 --> 29:57.365
- Hello.
- Audrey?

29:57.449 --> 30:00.285
Fletcher, hi. Are you still picking
Max up from school today?

30:00.326 --> 30:02.412
Here's the thing.
I really can't!

30:02.454 --> 30:06.374
I had a case I was certain would settle,
and it didn't, and I have to go to court.

30:06.458 --> 30:09.961
- Right.
- It's true! I really want to see Max today!

30:10.045 --> 30:11.963
I really do.

30:12.047 --> 30:14.841
Uh-huh, but things just keep coming up
at the last minute.

30:14.924 --> 30:17.969
- Yes, but this time it's different.
- I see. How is that?

30:18.011 --> 30:21.973
- Now I'm telling the truth.
- And last night you weren't. Well, what were you doing?

30:22.057 --> 30:25.018
Having sex!

30:25.101 --> 30:28.188
Well, I hope that it was
with someone very special.

30:28.271 --> 30:31.441
No! That's the thing. I don't even
like her, but she's a partner.

30:31.483 --> 30:36.196
I thought I could help my career
by makin' her squeal.

30:36.279 --> 30:39.824
Aah!

30:39.866 --> 30:42.994
What's wrong with me?

30:43.078 --> 30:45.372
I'm getting what I deserve.
I'm reaping what I sow. I'm...

30:57.092 --> 31:00.345
- Is Dad still picking me up?
- No, Max, he's not.

31:01.638 --> 31:04.557
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna
pick you up, okay?

31:04.641 --> 31:06.559
I'll work it out.

31:06.643 --> 31:08.603
I guess my wish
didn't come true.

31:08.686 --> 31:13.566
- What wish?
- I wished that for just one day Dad couldn't tell a lie.

31:19.823 --> 31:21.741
Max?

31:24.369 --> 31:28.331
I have something important
to talk to you about, okay?

31:28.373 --> 31:30.667
- Okay.
- Okay.

31:38.174 --> 31:42.429
- Hello?
- Audrey! Let me explain. Something has happened to me.

31:42.512 --> 31:46.433
Well, something else is about to happen
to you. Max and I are moving to Boston.

31:46.516 --> 31:48.727
- What?
- Jerry has asked me to marry him,

31:48.768 --> 31:51.438
and Max and I are going
this weekend to look at houses.

31:51.521 --> 31:53.398
I thought it was semiserious!

31:53.440 --> 31:56.234
It's just been given
a violent shove into serious.

31:56.317 --> 31:58.820
You can't move to Boston;
I'll never see Max!

31:58.903 --> 32:02.323
You'll have the same relationship
you have with him now, won't you?

32:02.407 --> 32:04.159
- Where are you?
- I'm going home.

32:04.242 --> 32:07.495
When you get there, just stay there.
I'm comin' over. We have to talk.

32:07.579 --> 32:11.833
- Fletcher!
- I'll be right there.

32:11.916 --> 32:15.211
- Hey, Mr. Reede...
- La, la, la, la

32:15.253 --> 32:17.213
La, la, la, la

32:23.678 --> 32:26.806
- Fletcher.
- Holy hell!

32:30.810 --> 32:34.105
You can run,
but you can't hide.

32:38.943 --> 32:41.112
What's your problem, schmuck?

32:41.154 --> 32:44.532
I'm an inconsiderate prick!

33:07.597 --> 33:09.516
Oh, shit!

33:14.187 --> 33:16.314
Shit!

33:23.571 --> 33:27.242
- You know why I pulled you over?
- Depends on how long you were following me!

33:28.493 --> 33:31.746
- Why don't we take it from the top?
- Here goes.

33:31.830 --> 33:33.790
I sped, I followed too closely,
I ran a stop sign,

33:33.915 --> 33:37.919
I almost hit a Chevy, I sped
some more, I failed to yield,

33:38.002 --> 33:42.006
I changed lanes without
signaling while speeding!

33:42.090 --> 33:45.510
- Is that all?
- No.

33:47.637 --> 33:50.473
I have unpaid parking tickets.

33:52.559 --> 33:54.519
Be gentle.

33:58.231 --> 34:00.191
Audrey! Wait!

34:03.319 --> 34:06.823
Wait, Audrey. Ooh!
Hold on. Wait!

34:06.906 --> 34:11.202
Wait. I just had an insight
into myself. I'm crazy.

34:11.327 --> 34:14.831
You call and say,
"Wait, I'll be right over,"

34:14.956 --> 34:17.500
and here's the crazy part...
I actually wait.

34:17.584 --> 34:21.629
- I can explain this.
- I have missed a department meeting.

34:21.713 --> 34:23.673
- Did you come in a cab?
- Yes!

34:23.715 --> 34:26.801
Where's your car?

34:26.885 --> 34:30.388
Thank you! I can't tell you
how much this means to me.

34:30.472 --> 34:35.810
- I can. $1,654.11.
- How do you sleep at night?

34:39.397 --> 34:42.484
I'm takin' this.

34:51.326 --> 34:53.620
You scratched my car!

34:53.703 --> 34:58.083
- Where?
- Right there!

34:59.167 --> 35:02.587
Oh, there.
That was already there.

35:02.712 --> 35:05.715
Why, you!

35:05.799 --> 35:07.759
You liar!

35:09.010 --> 35:11.137
- You know what I'm gonna do about this?
- What?

35:11.221 --> 35:14.933
Nothing! Because if I take you to court,
it'll drain eight hours out of my life,

35:15.058 --> 35:18.645
and you won't show up, and if I got the
judgement, you'd just stiff me anyway!

35:18.770 --> 35:22.899
So I'm gonna piss and moan
like an impotent jerk...

35:22.982 --> 35:26.403
and then bend over and
take it up the tailpipe!

35:26.528 --> 35:29.614
You been here before,
haven't ya?

35:29.656 --> 35:32.409
Well, I can't remember
when I've had more fun,

35:32.450 --> 35:34.577
but if you'll excuse me,
I have a class.

35:34.661 --> 35:36.579
Are you marrying this guy
because you're mad at me?

35:36.705 --> 35:39.082
No, I divorced you
because I was mad at you.

35:39.165 --> 35:42.419
- Wait. I want to talk about this!
- What do you want to say?

35:42.544 --> 35:45.380
Is this guy right for you?
He is so... not me!

35:45.463 --> 35:50.510
- That's one of his best qualities.
- But he's kind of a magoo.

35:50.635 --> 35:55.140
- I'm sorry.
- You're wrong. Sometimes maybe he is a little...

35:55.265 --> 35:58.768
- Magoo!
- Yes. But since we've been going out...

35:58.852 --> 36:01.855
- My God, I'm not having this conversation with you.
- Audrey, you can't go.

36:01.980 --> 36:04.357
- This is not fair.
- Fair?

36:04.482 --> 36:09.279
Okay, let's define fair. Last night
a five-year-old boy was crushed...

36:09.404 --> 36:12.991
because his father lied to him
about coming to his birthday party.

36:13.116 --> 36:14.993
- Fair?
- Last night...

36:15.118 --> 36:17.996
- Was none of my business... - Thank you...
- None of my business.

36:18.121 --> 36:21.499
Two years ago, it was my business.
But I don't have to care anymore.

36:21.624 --> 36:25.295
That's the magic of divorce.
But it matters to Max!

36:25.378 --> 36:28.590
Everything you do matters,
and everything you don't do.

36:28.673 --> 36:30.592
All right.
Now let me tell you something.

36:30.633 --> 36:32.594
I'm a bad father!

36:35.764 --> 36:37.682
I mean...

36:43.063 --> 36:45.648
I'm a bad father.

36:47.150 --> 36:51.529
You're not a bad father...
when you show up.

36:51.613 --> 36:54.366
What if I come right after court
and play ball?

36:54.449 --> 36:57.660
Then you and I can talk before
you make any rash decisions!

36:57.702 --> 36:59.996
No, we are leaving tonight.

37:00.038 --> 37:02.791
Please, Audrey.
Give me one more chance.

37:02.832 --> 37:05.251
I'm throwin' myself
on the mercy of the court.

37:05.335 --> 37:10.507
I lost you, but please
don't make me lose Max too.

37:12.801 --> 37:16.721
Give me a chance to be
the father I started out to be.

37:22.602 --> 37:25.855
- You're really coming?
- This is ironclad.

37:25.939 --> 37:29.067
This is the mother of all promises.
What time?

37:29.150 --> 37:31.069
Okay, 6:00.

37:31.152 --> 37:34.197
- Ten to six.
- All right.

37:34.239 --> 37:37.701
All right. But if I tell
Max that you're coming,

37:37.742 --> 37:41.037
and you don't show up and I have
to see that look on his face...

37:41.079 --> 37:43.498
that heartbreaking look...

37:43.540 --> 37:45.500
we're going to Boston.

37:45.542 --> 37:49.087
If I don't show up,
I'll pack you myself.

37:49.170 --> 37:52.424
I will lovingly wrap your
nicknacks with bubble paper.

37:52.507 --> 37:54.426
I hope so.

37:56.219 --> 37:59.514
Do you know what your son was doing
at 8:15 last night?

37:59.556 --> 38:03.143
He was making a birthday wish
that for just one day...

38:03.226 --> 38:06.187
his father couldn't tell a lie.

38:11.109 --> 38:14.529
Oh, my God!
That's it!

38:14.946 --> 38:17.198
"I do not like them, Sam I Am.

38:17.240 --> 38:19.951
"I do not like green eggs and ham.

38:20.035 --> 38:22.662
"Would you like them here or there?

38:22.746 --> 38:25.540
- I would not like them... "
- Excuse me.

38:25.582 --> 38:30.003
Hi. I'm Max's bad father...
Er, I'm his father.

38:30.086 --> 38:34.424
- Dad!
- Could I borrow him for just one second?

38:34.466 --> 38:39.095
- Monster Max!
- You came to play catch?

38:39.179 --> 38:41.890
I'd like to, but I can't.
I gotta talk to you.

38:41.931 --> 38:46.269
Your mommy told me about that wish
you made last night. It came true, Max.

38:46.311 --> 38:49.356
- Really? You mean you have to tell the truth?
- Yes.

38:49.439 --> 38:51.608
- No matter what?
- No matter what!

38:51.649 --> 38:54.903
- Is wrestling real?
- In the Olympics, yes. On channel 23, no.

38:54.944 --> 38:58.990
- Will sitting too close to the TV set make me go blind?
- Not in a million years.

38:59.074 --> 39:02.118
If I keep making this face,
will it get stuck that way?

39:02.202 --> 39:05.205
Uh-uh. In fact some people
make a good living that way.

39:08.124 --> 39:11.169
Now listen, Max.
You've gotta do something for me.

39:11.252 --> 39:13.880
I need you to take back that wish.

39:13.963 --> 39:16.508
- So you can lie?
- Yes.

39:16.591 --> 39:20.220
But not to you.
You see, Max,

39:20.303 --> 39:24.557
sometimes grownups need to lie.

39:25.683 --> 39:29.020
It's hard to explain,
but if...

39:29.104 --> 39:32.273
Look, here's a good example.
When your mommy was pregnant with you,

39:32.315 --> 39:35.151
she gained 40 pounds;
there was nothing she wouldn't eat.

39:35.235 --> 39:37.737
And Daddy was scared.
But when she'd ask me, "How do I look?"

39:37.821 --> 39:42.242
I'd say, "Honey, you look great.
You're glowing. "

39:42.325 --> 39:45.078
If I had told Mommy she looked like
a cow, it would have hurt her feelings.

39:45.161 --> 39:48.873
- Understand?
- My teacher tells me real beauty's on the inside.

39:48.957 --> 39:52.335
That's just something
ugly people say.

39:52.377 --> 39:56.256
Max, no one can survive in the adult
world if they have to stick to the truth.

39:56.339 --> 40:00.301
I could lose my case, I could lose
my promotion, I could even lose my job.

40:00.343 --> 40:02.303
Now, I need your help, Max.

40:02.345 --> 40:04.723
Okay.

40:04.806 --> 40:09.019
Okay. Do whatever
you did last night,

40:09.060 --> 40:13.398
only this time,
make it an "unwish. "

40:21.781 --> 40:23.700
I did it.

40:23.783 --> 40:26.036
Excellent!

40:26.119 --> 40:28.705
Now, I just need
a little test.

40:47.348 --> 40:50.977
- Did it work?
- Not like I'd hoped. Did you unwish it?

40:51.061 --> 40:54.189
- Only...
- What? Only what?

40:54.230 --> 40:57.692
Yesterday, when I wished it,
I really meant it.

40:57.734 --> 41:01.279
This time when I unwished it,
I only did it 'cause you told me to.

41:02.530 --> 41:04.491
All right.
Do it again.

41:04.574 --> 41:06.493
And this time, mean it.

41:06.576 --> 41:09.037
- But I can't!
- Why not?

41:09.079 --> 41:12.415
- 'Cause I don't want you to lie.
- I explained this.

41:12.457 --> 41:15.877
I have to lie.
Everybody lies.

41:15.919 --> 41:19.339
Mommy lies.
Even the wonderful Jerry lies.

41:19.422 --> 41:22.425
But you're the only one
that makes me feel bad.

41:22.467 --> 41:26.304
Max, recess is over.

41:26.388 --> 41:28.598
Come on in!

41:32.477 --> 41:34.437
Mom says we're moving to Boston.

41:34.479 --> 41:37.899
That isn't for sure yet.

41:37.941 --> 41:40.652
She promised we'd talk
about it tonight.

41:41.736 --> 41:43.655
I am comin'!

41:43.738 --> 41:45.990
You believe me,
don't you, Max?

41:47.075 --> 41:49.953
I'll see you later, buddy.

41:59.587 --> 42:03.466
- Fletcher. How's it hangin'?
- Short, shriveled and always to the left.

42:07.637 --> 42:11.141
Boss, it's Skull.
He knocked over another A.T.M.

42:11.182 --> 42:14.853
This time at knife-point.
He needs your legal advice.

42:18.982 --> 42:22.694
Stop breakin' the law, asshole!

42:30.618 --> 42:32.537
Boss, are you all right?

42:32.620 --> 42:35.040
My son hates me.

42:36.499 --> 42:41.046
Max loves you.
I've seen you together. You're his hero.

42:41.129 --> 42:44.466
Oh, yeah?

42:44.507 --> 42:48.011
Last night at his birthday
party, he made a wish...

42:48.053 --> 42:51.389
that I wouldn't be able
to lie for one whole day.

42:51.473 --> 42:53.975
- Kids.
- It came true.

42:54.017 --> 42:57.687
- What?
- Max's wish!

42:57.729 --> 43:00.190
It came true.

43:05.945 --> 43:09.032
Boss, maybe you should
just take a few days off.

43:09.074 --> 43:13.453
Greta! Didn't it seem weird to you that
I kept tellin' the truth all morning?

43:13.536 --> 43:15.455
Well, yeah. But...

43:17.457 --> 43:21.044
What are you saying?
That you are incapable of lying?

43:21.086 --> 43:24.255
That's right!
I am incapable of lying!

43:24.339 --> 43:28.718
- Just for today?
- Apparently... 'til 8:15 tonight.

43:28.802 --> 43:30.845
It's one of those
24-hour curses.

43:30.887 --> 43:32.847
Those are goin' around.

43:32.889 --> 43:35.266
- You don't believe me, do you?
- Of course not.

43:35.350 --> 43:38.978
How ironic!

43:39.062 --> 43:43.024
Okay. Ask me something
you think I would normally lie about.

43:43.066 --> 43:46.903
All right. Remember a couple
of months ago when I wanted a raise?

43:46.945 --> 43:50.156
- I don't want to do this.
- And the company wouldn't give me one...

43:50.240 --> 43:53.576
and I asked if you would give it
to me out of your own pocket...

43:53.618 --> 43:57.872
And you said the company would not allow
it, because it would create jealousy...

43:57.914 --> 44:00.083
among the other secretaries.

44:00.125 --> 44:05.088
Was that true, or did you just
not want to pony up the dough?

44:06.798 --> 44:09.592
Greta, please!

44:09.676 --> 44:14.097
Judge Stevens, hi! Fletcher Reede. I'm
scheduled in your court in half an hour.

44:14.139 --> 44:17.934
Judge Stevens, I badly, badly
need a continuance. Ill?

44:17.976 --> 44:21.938
Am I ill? That is
the perfect question for you to ask.

44:21.980 --> 44:24.983
- Please lie for me!
- I remember when you bought me this...

44:25.066 --> 44:28.194
antique frame from Tiffany's...
Tiffany's?

44:28.278 --> 44:31.781
Garage sale. Six-fifty,
marked down from ten.

44:34.242 --> 44:36.703
I'll give you the raise!

44:37.787 --> 44:39.748
Here's your raise.

44:39.789 --> 44:44.794
Hi, Judge Stevens!
I know I haven't given you an answer.

44:44.878 --> 44:47.881
But illness could mean so many things.

44:47.964 --> 44:50.300
Can you hold?
Hello? Mom!

44:50.341 --> 44:54.012
Hi! I wasn't really
on vacation.

44:54.095 --> 44:57.390
Because I didn't want
to talk to you!

44:57.474 --> 45:01.311
Because you insist on talking about Dad's
bowel movements... size, color, frequency!

45:01.394 --> 45:04.147
I'll call you later!
Hello?

45:04.230 --> 45:06.941
Oh, damn it!
I cut him off.

45:06.191 --> 45:09.819
I cut off the judge!

45:14.199 --> 45:16.785
Greta! Don't leave!

45:16.785 --> 45:19.704
I'm on my knees in a $900 suite!

45:21.915 --> 45:26.878
Mr. Reede. Several years ago,
a friend had a burglar on her roof.

45:26.961 --> 45:31.841
He fell through the skylight, landed on
a butcher's knife, cutting his leg.

45:31.883 --> 45:35.345
The burglar sued my friend.
He sued my friend!

45:35.428 --> 45:37.639
Because of guys like you, he won!

45:37.680 --> 45:42.143
My friend had to pay the burglar $6,000.
Is that justice?

45:42.185 --> 45:45.563
No. I'd have got him ten.

45:47.023 --> 45:49.359
- Good-bye, Mr. Reede.
- No, wait!

45:49.401 --> 45:51.403
I didn't understand!
Ask me again!

45:51.778 --> 45:54.864
- Have a nice day in court.
- Greta!

45:56.032 --> 45:58.702
- Hi.
- God in heaven!

45:58.785 --> 46:01.162
It's nice to see you too,
Fletcher. Are you busy?

46:01.204 --> 46:05.041
- Extremely.
- Good. Would you follow me, please?

46:08.878 --> 46:12.716
Did you know that the partnership
committee is headed by Mr. Allan himself?

46:12.799 --> 46:16.052
- Mm-hmm. - You used to
work directly for Mr. Allan.

46:16.094 --> 46:19.639
- Yeah.
- Tell me. What do you think of him?

46:19.723 --> 46:23.727
He's a pedantic,
pontificating, pretentious bastard!

46:23.810 --> 46:28.606
A belligerent old fart! A steaming
pile of cow dung! Figuratively speaking.

46:28.690 --> 46:31.776
Really? How delightful.
This way.

46:33.778 --> 46:39.409
Pardon me for interrupting.
Mr. Allan, you remember Fletcher Reede?

46:39.492 --> 46:42.579
Oh, yes! Nice to
see you again, Fletcher.

46:42.620 --> 46:45.665
I'll be observing you
in court this afternoon.

46:45.749 --> 46:48.626
I've been hearing
some good things about you.

46:48.710 --> 46:53.590
Well, Fletcher has just been telling me
how much he thinks of you.

46:53.715 --> 46:58.094
Why don't you tell Mr. Allan?
Well, what do you think of him?

47:04.726 --> 47:09.105
He's a pedantic, pontificating,
pretentious bastard.

47:09.147 --> 47:14.361
A belligerent old fart.
A worthless, steaming pile of cow dung.

47:14.444 --> 47:17.697
Figuratively speaking.

47:38.510 --> 47:40.887
That's the funniest damn thing
I've ever heard!

47:40.970 --> 47:43.807
You're a real card, Reede!

47:43.890 --> 47:46.267
I love a good roast!

47:47.310 --> 47:49.729
Do Simmons!

47:49.813 --> 47:51.940
Simmons is old!

47:52.023 --> 47:56.736
He should have been out years ago, but he
can't stay home 'cause he hates his wife!

47:58.530 --> 48:01.074
You've met her
at the Christmas parties.

48:01.157 --> 48:04.494
She's the one that gets plastered
and calls him a retard.

48:04.536 --> 48:08.748
And you, Tom. You're the biggest
brownnose I've ever seen!

48:08.832 --> 48:13.628
You've got your head so far up Mr. Allan's
ass, I can't tell where you end and he begins!

48:13.712 --> 48:15.922
Priceless!

48:17.632 --> 48:20.885
You have bad breath
caused by gingivitis.

48:20.969 --> 48:25.515
You couldn't get a porn star off. Your
hairpiece looks like something that was killed.

48:25.640 --> 48:30.353
I don't know whether to comb it
or scrape it off and bury it in lime!

48:30.478 --> 48:34.858
Loser! Idiot!
Wimp! Degenerate!

48:34.983 --> 48:37.819
Slut!

48:39.529 --> 48:43.908
I like your style, Reede!
That's what this stuffy company needs!

48:44.034 --> 48:48.371
- A little irreverence!
- Good! I'll see you later, dick-head!

48:49.456 --> 48:52.000
Dick-head!
Priceless!

48:52.125 --> 48:55.128
Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

49:08.892 --> 49:11.895
Keep your eye on that boy.

49:11.978 --> 49:14.522
Dick-head!

49:32.999 --> 49:37.212
Third District Court is now in session.

49:37.337 --> 49:41.716
The honorable
Judge Marshall Stevens presiding.

49:42.092 --> 49:46.388
Afternoon, Counselors.
Are we ready to begin?

49:46.513 --> 49:49.140
No, sir!
We are not ready to begin...

49:49.265 --> 49:51.518
because my client
has not arrived!

49:51.601 --> 49:53.520
Hurry up!
Move it, move it!

49:53.603 --> 49:56.648
Here she comes
to wreck the day

49:56.773 --> 49:59.567
- Mr. Reede!
- Sorry, Your Honor.

49:59.609 --> 50:01.778
Go, go, go. Lupe,
you keep those kids quiet.

50:01.820 --> 50:03.947
- I'm not even close to kidding.
- Sн, seтora.

50:03.988 --> 50:07.450
Sorry.
Billy threw up in the car.

50:07.492 --> 50:10.036
You brought your kids
to your divorce?

50:10.120 --> 50:12.288
- Sympathy.
- Well, it's working.

50:12.330 --> 50:14.457
- I feel sorry for them already.
- Hmm.

50:14.499 --> 50:16.960
Miss Appleton, you may begin.

50:17.001 --> 50:19.671
From March 6 through June 12...

50:19.754 --> 50:23.049
I surveilled Mrs. Cole
at the behest of Mr. Cole.

50:23.133 --> 50:25.802
During that period,
I noted that Mr. Cole...

50:25.885 --> 50:29.014
left each day
between 7:40 and 7:50.

50:29.097 --> 50:32.684
Thereafter Mrs. Cole
would frequently have...

50:32.767 --> 50:36.813
a male visitor arrive and stay
from one to four hours.

50:36.855 --> 50:41.526
I was able to take several photographs
of the male visitor.

50:41.609 --> 50:44.154
I see.

50:44.195 --> 50:48.324
Do you know what Mrs. Cole
and her male visitor did...

50:48.366 --> 50:51.453
during these frequent... visits?

50:51.494 --> 50:54.914
Well, they were pretty good
about keeping the shades drawn,

50:54.998 --> 50:59.627
but I was able to make
a recording of one such session.

51:01.046 --> 51:03.256
Your Honor,
as you are aware,

51:03.339 --> 51:05.759
under the terms
of the prenuptial agreement,

51:05.842 --> 51:09.637
if Mrs. Cole commits adultery,
she is entitled to nothing.

51:09.679 --> 51:13.600
With your permission, we'd like to play
the following tape recording.

51:18.355 --> 51:20.815
Here comes big daddy!

51:20.857 --> 51:24.110
Oh, God! Do it to me!

51:24.194 --> 51:27.947
Do it to me! Harder! Harder!

51:33.453 --> 51:35.622
Oh, come on!

51:35.705 --> 51:41.252
Your Honor, how can it be proved that the male
voice on that tape is not Mr. Cole himself?

51:41.336 --> 51:45.465
You are such a better lover
than my husband!

51:45.548 --> 51:49.052
- Your Honor, I object!
- And why is that, Mr. Reede?

51:49.094 --> 51:52.055
- It's devastating to my case!
- Overruled.

51:52.097 --> 51:54.182
Good call!

51:54.224 --> 51:57.769
- I gotta go. I haven't cleaned your pool.
- Your witness.

51:57.852 --> 52:00.814
All right.

52:00.897 --> 52:03.983
Well, Mr. Reede,
you may proceed.

52:09.447 --> 52:11.408
How?

52:35.682 --> 52:39.185
Your Honor, would the court be willing
to grant me a short bathroom break?

52:39.269 --> 52:42.105
- Can't it wait?
- Yes, it can.

52:42.188 --> 52:45.567
But I've heard that if you hold it,
it can damage the prostate gland,

52:45.608 --> 52:48.194
making it very difficult
to get an erection!

52:48.278 --> 52:51.072
- Is that true?
- It has to be.

52:51.114 --> 52:54.075
Well, in that case, I better
take a little break myself.

52:54.117 --> 52:57.454
But you get back here immediately
so we can finish this.

53:14.137 --> 53:18.350
How am I going
to get out of this?

53:19.642 --> 53:23.146
Think. Think.

53:23.188 --> 53:27.150
Think! Owie!

53:29.819 --> 53:31.946
Owie!

53:54.302 --> 53:57.430
Ohh! Ohh! Ohh!

54:22.872 --> 54:25.291
What the hell
are you doing?

54:26.459 --> 54:30.338
I'm kicking my ass!
Do you mind?

54:55.113 --> 54:58.116
I found him like this
in the bathroom, Your Honor.

54:58.199 --> 55:00.160
Somebody beat the hell out of him.

55:00.243 --> 55:03.163
- Who did this?
- A madman, Your Honor!

55:03.246 --> 55:06.458
A desperate fool at the end
of his pitiful rope!

55:06.541 --> 55:08.668
What did he look like?

55:08.752 --> 55:12.005
About 6'2", 180 pounds,
big teeth, kind of gangly.

55:12.088 --> 55:14.591
Bailiff, have the deputy
search the building.

55:14.632 --> 55:17.135
Yes, sir.

55:17.218 --> 55:19.763
Order! Order!

55:24.309 --> 55:27.771
Under the circumstances, I have
no choice but to recess this case...

55:27.812 --> 55:30.857
until 9:00 a.m.
tomorrow morning.

55:30.940 --> 55:34.152
Unless, of course, you feel
you can still proceed.

55:37.947 --> 55:40.283
Can you?

55:44.704 --> 55:49.334
Yes, I can.

55:49.417 --> 55:52.337
I admire your courage, Mr. Reede.

55:52.420 --> 55:55.090
We'll take a short recess
so that you can compose yourself,

55:55.131 --> 55:57.300
and then we'll get started.

56:07.143 --> 56:09.104
Here you go.

56:18.279 --> 56:22.450
Hello?

56:22.492 --> 56:26.162
- Dad?
- Max? How's it goin'?

56:26.204 --> 56:28.790
Great. You know Paul and Emanuel
from across the street?

56:28.832 --> 56:32.585
- Yeah. Uh-huh. - Well, they never
want to play baseball with me.

56:32.669 --> 56:35.004
But I told them I'm playing
tonight with my dad.

56:35.046 --> 56:37.340
So now they want to play.
Is that okay?

56:37.382 --> 56:40.385
Sure. The more the merrier.

56:40.468 --> 56:42.554
Coolest! Do you wanna be
Jose Canseco?

56:42.637 --> 56:47.392
Oh, yeah. Who else is gonna hit
that famous Nomo slider?

56:47.475 --> 56:50.854
- Mr. Reede.
- I gotta go now, Max.

56:50.937 --> 56:55.859
- I'll see you in a couple hours. Okay? Bye.
- Bye, Dad.

56:56.985 --> 57:00.405
He's really coming!
I'm gonna go change.

57:00.488 --> 57:02.532
- Okay, go ahead!
- Yeah!

57:07.287 --> 57:09.456
Mr. Reede!

57:09.539 --> 57:13.752
Mr. Reede! Mr...

57:13.835 --> 57:16.129
This is my lawyer.
He's a little unorthodox.

57:18.840 --> 57:22.010
Mr. Reede, you remember Kenneth Falk,
the man from the tape.

57:22.052 --> 57:24.679
- How could I forget?
- Hey, how you doin'?

57:24.721 --> 57:27.891
I've slipped into the seventh
circle of hell! Thank you.

57:27.932 --> 57:30.935
- You?
- Shouldn't we be going over our testimony right now?

57:31.019 --> 57:33.897
Basically, the plan is,
I walk you through the tape.

57:33.980 --> 57:36.149
Step-by-step,
I ask you questions.

57:36.232 --> 57:40.111
- And we give the explanation you came up with.
- Exactly.

57:40.195 --> 57:42.322
All we gotta do is lie.
That sounds simple enough.

57:42.405 --> 57:44.449
Doesn't it!

57:44.532 --> 57:47.410
Then I'll finish up
with dramatic questions.

57:47.452 --> 57:53.124
Something like: Mr. Falk, isn't it true
that you and Mrs. Cole...

57:53.208 --> 57:57.170
have never made
Lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo-lo, lo...

57:57.253 --> 57:59.172
Lo...

58:01.049 --> 58:05.553
Ugh! Oh, God!
I can't do it.

58:05.595 --> 58:09.724
I can't finish the question
if I know the answer is a lie.

58:24.114 --> 58:28.034
You may proceed, Mr. Reede.

58:41.131 --> 58:44.801
Respondent calls...

58:44.884 --> 58:46.845
Kenneth Falk.

59:03.361 --> 59:05.321
Raise your right hand.

59:05.363 --> 59:09.409
Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth, so help you God?

59:09.492 --> 59:13.204
I do! I mean...

59:16.082 --> 59:18.835
I do.

59:24.299 --> 59:27.177
Mr. Falk.

59:30.305 --> 59:32.474
Do you know my client,
Samantha Cole?

59:32.515 --> 59:34.559
Yes.

59:38.188 --> 59:42.650
Isn't it true that your relationship
with my client is entirely platonic?

59:42.692 --> 59:44.736
I object, Your Honor!

59:44.819 --> 59:47.197
To yourself?

59:47.322 --> 59:49.449
Yeah.

59:49.532 --> 59:53.453
But I would like to...
rephrase the question.

59:55.997 --> 59:59.250
Mr. Falk, would I be accurate...

59:59.334 --> 1:00:04.047
if I described your relationship
with Mrs. Cole as totally professional?

1:00:04.089 --> 1:00:07.258
I object, Your Honor,
and I move to strike!

1:00:07.342 --> 1:00:09.886
Mr. Reede, I don't know
what you're on,

1:00:10.011 --> 1:00:13.515
but you better get
to the point and quick.

1:00:13.556 --> 1:00:15.850
Thank you, sir.

1:00:18.728 --> 1:00:22.232
Is your relationship
with my client entirely platonic?

1:00:22.357 --> 1:00:25.068
Not! Is not your relationship
with my client:

1:00:25.110 --> 1:00:28.363
"Boink! Bad baby, bad baby!"

1:00:28.446 --> 1:00:30.573
Did you ever not make lo...

1:00:30.699 --> 1:00:33.702
- Did you...
- Mr. Reede!

1:00:33.743 --> 1:00:37.914
You had sex with her every time you met,
didn't you? Didn't you! Liar!

1:00:37.956 --> 1:00:40.083
- He's badgering the witness.
- It's his witness.

1:00:40.208 --> 1:00:43.712
You slammed her! You dunked her
donuts! You gave her dog a "snaussage"!

1:00:43.795 --> 1:00:46.172
You stuffed her
like a Thanksgiving turkey!

1:00:48.758 --> 1:00:53.638
All right, it's true, okay! I humped
her brains out! There! Now you happy?

1:00:59.978 --> 1:01:02.272
No further questions.

1:01:17.746 --> 1:01:21.082
Um...

1:01:21.166 --> 1:01:23.918
No questions.

1:01:24.002 --> 1:01:26.921
You may step down.

1:01:30.425 --> 1:01:33.678
Do I dare ask you
to call your next witness?

1:01:37.182 --> 1:01:39.934
I have no further witnesses,
Your Honor.

1:01:39.976 --> 1:01:42.896
What are you doing?
Call me!

1:01:42.979 --> 1:01:46.232
You do not understand.
I can't lie.

1:01:46.316 --> 1:01:49.235
I can't do anything dishonest
until 8:15 tonight!

1:01:49.319 --> 1:01:52.405
Listen, you bastard!
I want my money!

1:01:52.489 --> 1:01:55.825
I am not going to end up
a 31-year-old divorcee on welfare...

1:01:55.867 --> 1:01:59.454
because my scumbag attorney
had a sudden attack of conscience!

1:01:59.537 --> 1:02:02.040
Thirty-one?

1:02:02.165 --> 1:02:05.168
If Mr. Reede has
no further witnesses,

1:02:05.210 --> 1:02:07.629
then I have no choice
but to rule in favor of...

1:02:07.712 --> 1:02:09.589
Your Honor!

1:02:12.008 --> 1:02:14.844
I call Samantha Cole
to the stand.

1:02:14.886 --> 1:02:18.807
Order.

1:02:18.890 --> 1:02:21.768
Order! Order!

1:02:21.851 --> 1:02:24.229
- Knock it off!
- Sit down!

1:02:26.189 --> 1:02:28.733
Mr. Reede, it is out of
sheer morbid curiosity...

1:02:28.858 --> 1:02:31.528
I'm allowing this...
freak show to continue.

1:02:34.698 --> 1:02:37.909
Mrs. Cole...
if you dare.

1:02:53.299 --> 1:02:55.969
Mrs. Cole...

1:02:56.052 --> 1:02:59.514
is this a copy
of your driver's license?

1:03:01.307 --> 1:03:04.519
- Yes.
- It says here you're a blonde. Are you?

1:03:04.561 --> 1:03:07.480
- If you don't remember,
perhaps Mr. Falk will.

1:03:07.564 --> 1:03:10.233
- Brunette.
- We can play the tape again. Maybe it's on there.

1:03:10.316 --> 1:03:12.360
I'm a brunette!

1:03:12.402 --> 1:03:15.697
Thank you.
Now let's see.

1:03:15.822 --> 1:03:18.825
"Weight: 105."
Yeah! In your bra.

1:03:18.867 --> 1:03:20.827
- Your Honor, I object!
- You would!

1:03:20.869 --> 1:03:22.829
- Bastard!
- Hag!

1:03:22.871 --> 1:03:25.832
Quiet! Overruled! Weight?

1:03:27.500 --> 1:03:29.669
One-eighteen.

1:03:29.711 --> 1:03:32.714
All right, fine, fine.
I'm 127.

1:03:32.756 --> 1:03:35.884
Uh-huh. And it says here
you were born in 1964,

1:03:35.925 --> 1:03:38.261
but that's not true
either, is it?

1:03:38.345 --> 1:03:40.263
- Is it!
- No.

1:03:40.347 --> 1:03:44.225
Will you tell me what it says here on your
birth certificate under "date of birth"?

1:03:44.267 --> 1:03:46.853
Your Honor, what does this
have to do with anything?

1:03:46.895 --> 1:03:49.856
Overruled. Mrs. Cole,
answer the question.

1:03:49.898 --> 1:03:53.193
"1965."

1:03:53.234 --> 1:03:56.738
Now let me get this straight.

1:03:56.780 --> 1:04:01.534
That would mean that you lied
about your age to make yourself older.

1:04:01.576 --> 1:04:05.955
But why would any woman
want to do that?

1:04:06.039 --> 1:04:08.583
I changed it
so I could get married.

1:04:08.625 --> 1:04:13.213
And the truth
shall set you free!

1:04:13.254 --> 1:04:16.007
My client lied about her age!

1:04:16.091 --> 1:04:19.469
She was only 17 when she got married,
which makes her a minor,

1:04:19.552 --> 1:04:21.930
and in the great
state of California,

1:04:22.013 --> 1:04:24.307
no minor can enter
into any legal contract...

1:04:24.391 --> 1:04:26.601
without parental consent,
including...

1:04:26.643 --> 1:04:28.603
Prenuptial agreements.

1:04:28.645 --> 1:04:31.648
Prenuptial agreements!
This contract is void!

1:04:31.731 --> 1:04:35.443
The fact that my client has been ridden
more than Seattle Slew is irrelevant.

1:04:35.485 --> 1:04:39.572
Standard Community Property applies, and she
is entitled to half of the marital assets,

1:04:39.614 --> 1:04:42.158
or $11.395 million!

1:04:42.242 --> 1:04:46.538
Jordan fades back. Swoosh!
And that's the game!

1:04:46.621 --> 1:04:49.749
Nothing further, Your Honor.

1:04:57.590 --> 1:05:00.844
Order. Order. Order!

1:05:03.263 --> 1:05:05.306
In light of this new evidence,

1:05:05.390 --> 1:05:07.934
the court must rule
in favor of Mrs. Cole.

1:05:07.976 --> 1:05:12.063
- Yes!
- She is hereby awarded half the marital assets.

1:05:12.147 --> 1:05:16.109
The son of a bitch pulled it off!

1:05:16.151 --> 1:05:20.530
- I didn't know!
- It doesn't matter. The contract's void.

1:05:20.613 --> 1:05:24.659
Order. Order.

1:05:24.701 --> 1:05:28.246
I understand both parties
have agreed to joint custody.

1:05:28.329 --> 1:05:29.873
- Is that correct?
- Yes.

1:05:29.956 --> 1:05:31.416
- Yes.
- No.

1:05:31.499 --> 1:05:33.418
I'm contesting custody.

1:05:33.501 --> 1:05:36.004
- What?
- If I get sole custody,

1:05:36.087 --> 1:05:38.631
that's another ten grand
in child support payments.

1:05:38.673 --> 1:05:41.092
You just won $11 million!

1:05:41.176 --> 1:05:44.012
Hey, I'm the victim here.
You said it yourself.

1:05:44.095 --> 1:05:47.515
Now I'm gonna hit him
where it hurts.

1:05:47.599 --> 1:05:51.978
But you...
you said he was a good father.

1:05:52.020 --> 1:05:54.564
So?

1:05:56.358 --> 1:06:01.321
Well, Mr. Reede, do we have
an agreement on custody or not?

1:06:03.990 --> 1:06:05.909
No.

1:06:05.992 --> 1:06:08.870
I see.

1:06:08.912 --> 1:06:13.875
In that case, there will be a custody
hearing on the 19th at 9:00 a.m.

1:06:13.917 --> 1:06:16.252
Court is adjourned.

1:06:22.676 --> 1:06:25.053
- Come on, let's go.
- Daddy!

1:06:25.095 --> 1:06:28.056
You stop that whining, or I'll
give you something to whine about!

1:06:28.098 --> 1:06:30.809
I wanna go with Daddy!

1:06:30.892 --> 1:06:33.728
Come here, kids. Come on.
It's all right. Don't you worry.

1:06:33.770 --> 1:06:36.940
I promise we'll be together,
whatever I have to do.

1:06:37.023 --> 1:06:39.067
It's okay. It's okay.

1:06:39.109 --> 1:06:42.153
Oh, for God's sake, will you
give me those? They're mine!

1:06:42.237 --> 1:06:45.156
Let go of Daddy! Let go of him!
Let go of Daddy!

1:06:45.240 --> 1:06:48.618
- We're leaving now! Lupe, come on!
- Sн, seтora.

1:06:48.702 --> 1:06:52.914
Don't you have some checks to write?
You haven't paid for them yet.

1:07:04.592 --> 1:07:07.846
I love children.

1:07:07.929 --> 1:07:10.849
They give you so much leverage
in a case like this.

1:07:10.932 --> 1:07:15.270
You did an incredible job, partner.

1:07:15.311 --> 1:07:17.647
Look at him.

1:07:17.731 --> 1:07:20.191
He's stunned.
He can't believe it.

1:07:22.736 --> 1:07:26.072
Your Honor, may I please
approach the bench?

1:07:26.114 --> 1:07:28.491
We're adjourned, Mr. Reede.

1:07:28.575 --> 1:07:32.037
Your Honor, I think
we've made a big mistake.

1:07:32.120 --> 1:07:34.581
Mr. Reede, I am tired
and very cranky.

1:07:34.622 --> 1:07:38.418
I know, but this is
just... wrong, isn't it?

1:07:38.460 --> 1:07:40.587
I manipulated the system.

1:07:40.628 --> 1:07:44.591
Just because you bought it doesn't mean
I'm right. It's a technicality!

1:07:44.632 --> 1:07:47.802
Young man, having my judgement
mocked in my own court...

1:07:47.886 --> 1:07:50.221
is not something
I'm prepared to tolerate!

1:07:50.305 --> 1:07:54.601
Well, tell that to the kids when
they're adopted... by the Manson family!

1:07:54.642 --> 1:07:58.730
One more word out of you, Mr. Reede,
and I'll hold you in contempt!

1:07:58.813 --> 1:08:01.733
I hold myself in contempt!

1:08:01.816 --> 1:08:04.027
Why should you be any different?

1:08:04.110 --> 1:08:06.112
Bailiff, take him away!

1:08:06.154 --> 1:08:09.074
This man is a good father,
and children are not leverage!

1:08:09.157 --> 1:08:13.411
Oh, no, don't do this!
I have a date to play ball with my son!

1:08:13.495 --> 1:08:17.165
I can't be late!
It's my last chance!

1:08:17.248 --> 1:08:19.584
I'm Jose Canseco!

1:08:19.667 --> 1:08:23.046
I'm Jose Canseco!

1:08:26.007 --> 1:08:27.967
Phone call!
Phone call!

1:08:28.009 --> 1:08:30.970
I get a phone call!
I get a phone call!

1:08:31.012 --> 1:08:33.223
I get a phone call!

1:08:33.306 --> 1:08:35.809
Hello?

1:08:35.850 --> 1:08:38.436
Audrey, it's me.
Don't hang up!

1:08:38.520 --> 1:08:41.106
I can't talk right now.
Our flight leaves at 8:00.

1:08:41.189 --> 1:08:45.318
- What?
- I'm taking Max someplace where you can't do this anymore.

1:08:45.360 --> 1:08:48.697
Audrey, wait! The most amazing thing
has happened to me.

1:08:48.738 --> 1:08:52.492
I'm a changed man! Just come to the
courthouse with $1,000 and bail me out.

1:08:52.534 --> 1:08:55.537
Hello? Hello?

1:08:55.620 --> 1:08:58.832
- Time's up, pal.
- No, just one more call. Just one more call.

1:09:02.377 --> 1:09:05.213
Okay, let's go.

1:09:06.881 --> 1:09:08.842
- Ready?
- Yeah.

1:09:08.883 --> 1:09:11.845
- Will you get the door, please?
- Okay.

1:09:11.886 --> 1:09:14.180
Thank you.

1:09:14.222 --> 1:09:17.726
Mr. Reede, you made bail.

1:09:17.767 --> 1:09:20.895
Greta! Oh, thank God!

1:09:20.937 --> 1:09:23.648
Am I too late?
Have you been sexually molested yet?

1:09:23.648 --> 1:09:25.400
Because I could circle the block.

1:09:27.694 --> 1:09:29.529
How did you know I was here?

1:09:29.571 --> 1:09:31.865
One of the other secretaries
called me at home,

1:09:31.906 --> 1:09:34.367
said you went all noble
in front of Mr. Allan.

1:09:34.409 --> 1:09:36.703
Yeah, I think I'm fired.
Isn't that great?

1:09:36.745 --> 1:09:39.080
I'll start my own firm.
Do you need a job?

1:09:39.122 --> 1:09:41.666
I don't think
you can afford me.

1:09:44.919 --> 1:09:48.590
Oh, man, I gotta get my car.
Audrey's on her way to the airport.

1:09:48.631 --> 1:09:52.385
I could lose Max forever.
I can't let that happen. I love him!

1:09:52.427 --> 1:09:55.055
You know, this truth stuff
is pretty cool.

1:09:55.096 --> 1:09:59.142
I love my son!
I love my son!

1:09:59.225 --> 1:10:02.896
I love my son!
I love my son!

1:10:02.937 --> 1:10:06.649
Hey, need some change?
Take everything!

1:10:08.610 --> 1:10:10.570
But it's not gonna make you happy.

1:10:10.612 --> 1:10:13.073
I love my son!

1:10:13.114 --> 1:10:15.408
I love my son!

1:10:15.450 --> 1:10:18.244
I love my son!

1:10:19.454 --> 1:10:21.664
Hey, there you are!

1:10:21.748 --> 1:10:24.501
- Hi.
- Just in time.

1:10:24.584 --> 1:10:27.587
Oh, this is the happiest moment
of my entire life.

1:10:27.629 --> 1:10:30.924
O-Oh! Well, m-me, m-mine...

1:10:30.965 --> 1:10:33.343
Well, ours... also.

1:10:33.426 --> 1:10:37.931
Hey, gipper. I have something
for you, young man.

1:10:37.972 --> 1:10:41.768
Ooh, watch yourself.
It's the claw!

1:10:41.810 --> 1:10:44.437
Ooh, the claw's comin' at ya.

1:10:44.479 --> 1:10:48.483
Ooh, you're scared of the claw.
You're scared of the claw.

1:10:48.525 --> 1:10:51.695
- Jerry. Jerry.
- Huh?

1:10:51.778 --> 1:10:54.030
It's okay.
You don't have to...

1:10:54.114 --> 1:10:57.617
Tower Air flight 1511
to Boston is now boarding.

1:10:57.659 --> 1:10:59.619
- Ooh, that's us.
- Yeah.

1:10:59.661 --> 1:11:02.330
- Ready to go?
- Yes. You ready?

1:11:02.372 --> 1:11:04.541
- Okay.
- Great.

1:11:04.624 --> 1:11:06.418
Jim Rubing, please report
to Airport Security.

1:11:12.882 --> 1:11:14.843
Excuse me!

1:11:14.926 --> 1:11:17.846
What gate is flight 1511 leaving from?
It's an emergency!

1:11:17.887 --> 1:11:21.224
Gate number 123, but you'll never
make it. Flight's already boarding.

1:11:21.307 --> 1:11:24.060
It takes more than a half hour
to get through security.

1:11:24.144 --> 1:11:28.064
If you want to go to Boston, there's another
flight leaving tomorrow morning at 7:00 a.m.

1:11:28.148 --> 1:11:30.400
Flight number one-twenty...

1:11:32.402 --> 1:11:35.447
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome aboard flight 1511...

1:11:35.530 --> 1:11:37.741
from Los Angeles
to Boston's Logan Airport.

1:11:37.824 --> 1:11:41.578
We'll be departing shortly, and if you
need help stowing your carry-on items...

1:11:41.661 --> 1:11:43.538
- Honey, can I help you?
- I'm fine.

1:11:43.580 --> 1:11:47.584
- Are you sure?
- Jerry, I can open the bag!

1:11:49.044 --> 1:11:51.338
Would you like anything
to drink before takeoff?

1:11:51.379 --> 1:11:54.549
Yes. Anything
with alcohol, please.

1:11:54.591 --> 1:11:57.052
Audrey.

1:11:57.093 --> 1:12:00.889
If you'll focus on the screen,
we'll be running a safety video.

1:12:00.930 --> 1:12:03.099
How about that drink?

1:12:25.246 --> 1:12:28.583
Max! Max!

1:12:30.293 --> 1:12:33.213
Max!

1:12:33.254 --> 1:12:35.590
Wait!

1:12:39.135 --> 1:12:42.097
That oughta do it.

1:12:44.265 --> 1:12:46.059
Hey!

1:12:46.101 --> 1:12:48.645
Thanks! It's running great!

1:12:51.606 --> 1:12:53.942
Max!

1:12:57.779 --> 1:13:02.242
Hey! Max!

1:13:02.283 --> 1:13:05.370
Hey!

1:13:16.464 --> 1:13:19.467
Max! I'm coming!

1:13:29.519 --> 1:13:31.980
Max!

1:13:40.655 --> 1:13:43.867
Max! Max, where are you?

1:13:48.288 --> 1:13:50.165
I love you.

1:13:53.043 --> 1:13:55.086
Thank you.

1:13:55.170 --> 1:13:59.090
That wasn't exactly
the answer I was looking for.

1:13:59.174 --> 1:14:02.177
Thank you very much?

1:14:06.014 --> 1:14:08.767
- I'm sorry. It's just...
- Too fast?

1:14:08.850 --> 1:14:11.227
- It was too fast, wasn't it?
- No, i-it's...

1:14:11.311 --> 1:14:13.605
Chemistry?
Whatever it is, we can work on it.

1:14:13.688 --> 1:14:18.234
- No, no, no. It's just that...
- Oh, my God, it's Fletcher!

1:14:18.318 --> 1:14:22.072
- No, no, this has nothing to do with Fletcher.
- No, honey, it's Fletcher.

1:14:22.197 --> 1:14:25.367
- What?
- Dad?

1:14:26.826 --> 1:14:30.580
I made it!
I'm late, but I made it!

1:14:30.705 --> 1:14:33.458
What is he doing?

1:14:33.541 --> 1:14:37.212
He came to see us off. Wave.

1:14:40.715 --> 1:14:44.302
I won't let you go!

1:14:50.600 --> 1:14:52.852
Oh, shit!

1:14:52.977 --> 1:14:56.231
Da-da-da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da

1:14:57.941 --> 1:15:01.695
Control one-nine, this is Tower
1511, heavy. Ready for takeoff.

1:15:01.778 --> 1:15:05.031
Hey!

1:15:09.411 --> 1:15:11.663
- What was that?
- Looked like a shoe.

1:15:11.746 --> 1:15:13.957
Pull over!

1:15:14.082 --> 1:15:16.584
Pull this thing over!

1:15:16.710 --> 1:15:20.755
Control one-nine, some idiot has hijacked a
flight of stairs. We're gonna stop this plane.

1:15:20.797 --> 1:15:24.384
One-nine Control. We copy.

1:15:25.635 --> 1:15:28.555
Yeah!

1:15:28.680 --> 1:15:31.099
No-o-o-o-o!

1:16:08.970 --> 1:16:11.431
You people are all doing
a wonderful job!

1:16:11.514 --> 1:16:13.600
That's far enough, folks.

1:16:13.683 --> 1:16:16.436
He's my husband...
was my husband.

1:16:16.519 --> 1:16:18.480
- All right, go ahead.
- Okay.

1:16:18.605 --> 1:16:21.775
Max, you stay here with Jerry,
and I'll be right back, okay?

1:16:24.778 --> 1:16:27.447
- Audrey! Great news!
- Fletcher!

1:16:27.530 --> 1:16:30.784
Both my legs are broken,
so they can't take me right to jail.

1:16:30.825 --> 1:16:33.787
Fletcher, what were you doing?
Are you out of your mind?

1:16:33.828 --> 1:16:38.750
No, I'm thinking clear.
I've never been this clear!

1:16:38.792 --> 1:16:42.212
- Dad?
- Creep.

1:16:42.295 --> 1:16:45.882
- He was getting kind of upset.
- Are you all right?

1:16:45.965 --> 1:16:50.136
Yeah. I'm hurtin' here, though.

1:16:50.220 --> 1:16:52.806
I'm a dope, Max.

1:16:52.847 --> 1:16:55.308
All this time
you've been here...

1:16:55.350 --> 1:16:58.186
and I could see you anytime,
but I didn't.

1:16:58.269 --> 1:17:02.816
Then your mom told me you were moving
to Boston, and I started thinking.

1:17:02.857 --> 1:17:05.485
I could be sitting around
sometime and...

1:17:05.527 --> 1:17:10.198
want to look at you
and hold you and play with you,

1:17:10.281 --> 1:17:13.493
and I won't be able to.

1:17:13.535 --> 1:17:17.038
I don't think I'm gonna
do too well with that.

1:17:18.748 --> 1:17:22.293
I love you more than anything else
in the world, Max,

1:17:22.335 --> 1:17:24.671
and you know it's true.

1:17:24.754 --> 1:17:27.799
I couldn't say it if it
wasn't true. Not today.

1:17:29.884 --> 1:17:34.848
I love you, and I'll
never hurt you again.

1:17:38.727 --> 1:17:41.646
He's telling the truth, Mom.
He's not allowed to lie.

1:17:41.688 --> 1:17:45.567
I made a wish, and anything Dad
says today has to be the truth.

1:17:45.650 --> 1:17:47.569
Max.

1:17:48.695 --> 1:17:51.114
It's 8:45.

1:17:51.197 --> 1:17:53.491
You made the wish at 8:15.

1:17:53.533 --> 1:17:56.411
I've been able to lie
for the last half hour.

1:17:56.494 --> 1:17:59.706
- So you weren't...
- No, it was the truth!

1:17:59.748 --> 1:18:02.208
I just wanted
to be honest with you.

1:18:02.250 --> 1:18:04.711
I always want
to be honest with you.

1:18:10.133 --> 1:18:14.346
Mom, do we have to go to Boston?

1:18:19.559 --> 1:18:21.686
No, Max, you don't have to go.

1:18:21.728 --> 1:18:24.314
Yeah!

1:18:24.397 --> 1:18:27.484
I, on the other hand,
do have to.

1:18:27.567 --> 1:18:30.403
A hospital to run.

1:18:30.445 --> 1:18:34.616
That's an open-ended ticket
if you ever change your mind.

1:18:34.699 --> 1:18:36.910
Thank you.

1:18:42.832 --> 1:18:45.794
Looks like he's
got his father back.

1:18:52.133 --> 1:18:58.098
Happy birthday, dear Maximus

1:18:58.139 --> 1:19:04.604
Happy birthday to you

1:19:04.646 --> 1:19:06.773
Okay, Max, make a wish.

1:19:06.856 --> 1:19:10.443
Ahhh, wait! I don't know
if we should do this.

1:19:10.527 --> 1:19:14.572
Oh, Fletcher, come on. What are
the odds of that happening again?

1:19:16.533 --> 1:19:19.035
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1:19:19.119 --> 1:19:21.204
Okay, Max, go ahead.

1:19:28.503 --> 1:19:31.548
Mom? Dad?

1:19:46.312 --> 1:19:48.231
Max!

1:19:51.735 --> 1:19:55.113
Did you wish for your mom and I
to get back together again?

1:19:55.155 --> 1:19:57.615
No, I wished for Rollerblades.

1:20:01.411 --> 1:20:04.998
Do you want to cut the cake...

1:20:05.040 --> 1:20:07.000
Dad?

1:20:07.042 --> 1:20:09.252
I'd love to.

1:20:09.336 --> 1:20:12.172
But I have
this horrible pain in my arm.

1:20:12.213 --> 1:20:14.257
Oh, no, it's the claw!

1:20:14.341 --> 1:20:17.177
No one can stop the claw!

1:20:17.218 --> 1:20:21.556
No one can stop it!

1:20:26.770 --> 1:20:30.148
Nothing can stop the claw!

1:20:52.545 --> 1:20:57.008
If I was a boxer, I would bounce
those things like Sugar Ray Leonard.

1:20:57.050 --> 1:21:00.053
I'm sorry.

1:21:00.095 --> 1:21:02.555
Brought your kids
to your divorce?

1:21:02.639 --> 1:21:04.599
- Sympathy.
- Well, it's working!

1:21:04.683 --> 1:21:07.185
I feel sorry for them already.

1:21:07.227 --> 1:21:10.397
For this you will pay
a terrible price.

1:21:13.400 --> 1:21:16.569
Well, it's working!
I feel sorry for them already.

1:21:16.611 --> 1:21:18.571
Hmm.

1:21:26.079 --> 1:21:29.541
Ahhh!

1:21:29.582 --> 1:21:31.543
Mrs. Cole...

1:21:44.723 --> 1:21:46.808
a goose.

1:21:49.477 --> 1:21:51.438
Including...

1:21:51.479 --> 1:21:53.440
Prenuptial agreements.

1:21:53.481 --> 1:21:56.818
Prenuptial agreements

1:22:02.240 --> 1:22:04.784
No! I'd have got him ten.

1:22:04.826 --> 1:22:07.120
Good-bye, Mr. Reede.

1:22:07.162 --> 1:22:09.664
No! Wait!
I didn't know she had...

1:22:33.772 --> 1:22:37.525
Oh, shit.

1:22:37.609 --> 1:22:41.529
Now let's see. "Weight: 105"?

1:22:41.613 --> 1:22:43.656
Yeah! In your bra.

1:22:43.698 --> 1:22:45.992
- Your Honor, I object!
- You would!

1:22:46.034 --> 1:22:48.161
- Overactor!
- Jezebel!

1:22:53.208 --> 1:22:57.462
He put me up to it.

1:22:57.504 --> 1:23:01.508
Yeah, sure he did.

1:23:01.549 --> 1:23:04.594
Oh, no.
They're onto me.
