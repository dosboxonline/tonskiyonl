00:56.588 --> 00:57.547
[whistles loudly]

01:28.755 --> 01:30.005
[boards creaking]

01:55.630 --> 01:56.713
[whistles loudly]

01:57.297 --> 01:58.963
[man yells] Malenchenko!

02:09.672 --> 02:11.255
[man yells] Hey, I need help here.

02:12.338 --> 02:14.338
[man 2] This area smells like shit.

02:18.547 --> 02:19.672
[sighs]

02:20.047 --> 02:21.963
The dead number at least 47.

02:22.047 --> 02:25.463
Hard to get a firm count with
the state of some of the bodies.

02:25.547 --> 02:26.672
Survivors?

02:27.422 --> 02:29.630
-[man] The horses are here.
-Well, Okhchen?

02:30.088 --> 02:31.255
A small group.

02:31.922 --> 02:34.755
Attacked last night.
Then headed back the way they came.

02:35.172 --> 02:36.922
[man] Headed back for their barrow?

02:37.005 --> 02:38.297
I believe so, sir.

02:39.422 --> 02:41.588
Have the men prepare to move out.

02:41.880 --> 02:43.838
Signal the other teams we've made contact.

02:45.213 --> 02:47.672
We will track and destroy these monsters.

03:03.922 --> 03:06.880
Permission to speak freely,
Comrade Lieutenant?

03:06.963 --> 03:08.672
Of course, Sergei Pavlovich.

03:09.963 --> 03:12.338
I fear the teams are too far apart.

03:12.422 --> 03:15.380
We cannot support each other
if we encounter too many of them.

03:16.713 --> 03:18.547
[Lieutenant] <i>I raised that concern also.</i>

03:18.630 --> 03:21.880
<i>But the major thinks we can</i>
<i>cover more area this way.</i>

03:21.963 --> 03:24.588
<i>He's confident each team</i>
<i>can handle itself.</i>

03:24.963 --> 03:26.672
[Sergei] <i>And the planes we requested?</i>

03:26.755 --> 03:29.880
[Lieutenant] <i>The Air Force is busy with</i>
<i>the Germans besieging Stalingrad.</i>

03:30.838 --> 03:33.922
<i>There's darkness</i>
<i>in every direction these days, comrade.</i>

03:34.338 --> 03:36.463
<i>We'll have to find our own way through it.</i>

03:45.463 --> 03:49.047
There are places like this
scattered throughout the deep forest.

03:50.172 --> 03:51.505
Old places.

03:52.963 --> 03:55.088
My people believe they are cursed.

03:55.755 --> 03:57.088
[Lieutenant] I can feel it.

03:58.797 --> 04:00.338
The air feels...

04:01.505 --> 04:02.422
heavy.

04:03.463 --> 04:05.922
They are close now. They know we're here.

04:26.588 --> 04:28.588
-[beastly roar]
-[man yelling]

04:33.297 --> 04:34.755
[men yelling]

04:35.172 --> 04:36.213
[man] Go!

04:39.005 --> 04:39.963
[man] Cover me!

04:40.922 --> 04:41.838
[man 2] Reloading!

04:44.213 --> 04:45.255
[Lieutenant] In the trees!

04:56.463 --> 04:58.213
Behind us!

05:06.130 --> 05:07.047
[gun clicks]

05:23.297 --> 05:24.463
[man yells] Move out!

05:31.213 --> 05:32.463
[chains clink]

05:33.338 --> 05:36.213
[men cough and groan]

05:37.880 --> 05:40.380
[man whimpers and groans]

05:42.088 --> 05:43.630
[Okhchen] Comrade Lieutenant!

05:53.005 --> 05:56.047
-[Lieutenant] What is it?
-A body, one of ours.

05:56.505 --> 05:59.005
Whatever happened to him,
it was some time ago.

06:00.297 --> 06:01.297
Cheka.

06:01.922 --> 06:03.213
Secret police.

06:03.505 --> 06:06.880
[chuckles]
This place was bad luck for him too.

06:07.630 --> 06:08.547
Yes.

06:10.463 --> 06:12.713
And the sooner we're gone, the better.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.422
[coughs]

06:26.255 --> 06:27.630
[distant flare fires]

06:33.297 --> 06:34.172
Hey.

06:35.880 --> 06:37.005
Can you play?

06:37.713 --> 06:40.505
Yes, I can, but I should not.

06:41.713 --> 06:42.672
Play for Maxim.

06:49.463 --> 06:51.463
-[gunfire]
-[men screaming]

07:04.963 --> 07:06.963
[balalaika playing]

07:15.880 --> 07:17.880
[men hum]

07:28.213 --> 07:30.088
It was my fault, sir.

07:40.505 --> 07:41.547
[Lieutenant sighs]

07:43.755 --> 07:44.963
[Sergei] Who was he?

07:45.838 --> 07:46.838
A Major.

07:47.880 --> 07:49.297
Boris Grishin.

07:49.838 --> 07:53.380
He was assigned to Operation Hades.

07:55.713 --> 07:57.088
Does that mean anything to you?

07:57.880 --> 07:59.547
I've heard rumors of it.

08:02.797 --> 08:07.047
An operation focused on
exploring arcane peasant myths.

08:08.005 --> 08:12.005
<i>[Lieutenant] In November 1919, afterÂ </i>
<i>the White Army was forced to retreat,</i>

08:12.088 --> 08:14.797
<i>Grishin was dispatched</i>
<i>on a secret mission.</i>

08:14.880 --> 08:16.588
<i>He was an occultist.</i>

08:17.547 --> 08:21.755
<i>His assignment was to perform</i>
<i>a certain black magic ritual,</i>

08:22.505 --> 08:24.713
<i>whispered about among the Koryaks.</i>

08:25.130 --> 08:30.755
<i>It was meant to summon unholy creatures</i>
<i>who could fight beside the Red Army.</i>

08:32.005 --> 08:35.880
<i>The operation doesn't seem to</i>
<i>have worked out very well for him.</i>

08:35.963 --> 08:37.963
[ground rumbles]

08:40.255 --> 08:41.422
[beast growls]

08:44.505 --> 08:45.963
[beast roars]

09:01.422 --> 09:04.422
[Sergei] <i>We must take this information</i>
<i>to our superiors.</i>

09:04.505 --> 09:06.630
<i>They could end this plague.</i>

09:06.713 --> 09:10.713
<i>[Lieutenant] They would more likely end us</i>
<i>for revealing their past mistakes.</i>

09:11.922 --> 09:15.172
<i>No, we have our mission, comrade.</i>

09:15.922 --> 09:17.005
<i>Nothing more.</i>

09:17.630 --> 09:18.630
<i>Nothing less.</i>

09:22.297 --> 09:25.922
Have you ever seen
a ghoul barrow that big, Lieutenant?

09:26.588 --> 09:27.422
Never.

09:29.172 --> 09:31.088
-[Lieutenant] Pogodin!
-[Pogodin] Sir.

09:31.172 --> 09:32.755
[Lieutenant] Time to earn your pay.

09:32.838 --> 09:34.588
Of course, comrade.

09:44.088 --> 09:46.005
[Okhchen] I've never seen so many tunnels.

09:50.463 --> 09:52.255
I don't like it down here.

09:52.547 --> 09:54.088
[Pogodin] Stop your whining.

09:54.172 --> 09:56.047
[growling and hissing]

09:56.172 --> 09:57.630
[Okhchen] I can hear them coming.

10:09.338 --> 10:11.880
-Pogodin.
-I'm working on it.

10:12.130 --> 10:13.047
[rapid gun fire]

10:13.130 --> 10:14.422
One more wire.

10:15.380 --> 10:16.630
Pogodin!

10:17.297 --> 10:18.505
Almost.

10:19.713 --> 10:21.630
-They're closing in!
-[ghouls howl and chitter]

10:22.755 --> 10:24.422
[Okhchen]There's too many of them.

10:26.005 --> 10:27.338
What's the hold up?

10:30.463 --> 10:32.463
[distant rapid gunfire]

10:44.547 --> 10:48.755
You are getting older... and slower.

10:48.922 --> 10:50.172
[laughs]

10:50.255 --> 10:51.922
Next time, you do it!

10:56.630 --> 10:58.630
[rumbling]

10:59.797 --> 11:00.838
Is it sealed?

11:03.047 --> 11:04.213
Are we done?

11:17.463 --> 11:18.422
No.

11:38.588 --> 11:41.088
Sir, shall we prepare to fall back?

11:42.672 --> 11:44.922
The horses cannot outrun that horde.

11:45.505 --> 11:48.630
The creatures will catch us in the trees
and tear us apart.

11:49.463 --> 11:51.505
We must make our stand here.

11:51.588 --> 11:54.213
Sergei, bring me the fastest horse!

11:54.297 --> 11:57.838
Kaminsky, unload all
the ammunition and explosives.

11:57.922 --> 11:59.463
Maxim, Oleg!

11:59.547 --> 12:02.463
Take those charges
and set them at the base of the cliff.

12:02.547 --> 12:03.588
Double time!

12:05.088 --> 12:07.963
Set up the machine gun positions
on our flanks.

12:09.172 --> 12:10.713
How can I help, sir?

12:11.213 --> 12:14.463
Hold the reins tight. She is fierce.

12:14.547 --> 12:17.213
One of us can make it through
if we slow them down.

12:17.297 --> 12:19.547
No. Please, sir. No!

12:19.630 --> 12:22.088
[ghouls howl]

12:22.172 --> 12:23.797
I'd rather die with you.

12:25.088 --> 12:27.672
-I beg you, let me stay.
-Give the Major our coordinates.

12:27.755 --> 12:30.547
Tell him to bomb this place
into scorched rubble.

12:30.630 --> 12:32.838
-Father, please.
-That...

12:33.297 --> 12:34.422
is an order.

12:34.838 --> 12:37.338
Ride like hell and don't look back!

12:45.255 --> 12:47.922
Comrades, we stand here.

12:48.505 --> 12:50.172
We die here!

12:50.255 --> 12:52.505
-It has been an honor!
-[men yell]

13:17.338 --> 13:19.338
[yells]

13:21.630 --> 13:23.630
[intense orchestral music plays]

13:30.422 --> 13:31.297
[inaudible]

14:16.255 --> 14:18.255
[ghouls growl]

14:28.588 --> 14:30.963
[balalaika playing]
