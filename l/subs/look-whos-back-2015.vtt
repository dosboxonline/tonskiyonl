00:35.834 --> 00:37.292
Good evening.

00:40.834 --> 00:44.584
Good evening. May I introduce myself?
My name is Köppl.

00:44.751 --> 00:47.084
<i>Manners Coach,
Member of the Etiquette Club</i>

00:47.251 --> 00:48.334
Good evening, Mr. Köppl.

00:48.751 --> 00:51.626
My problem is that wherever I go,

00:51.792 --> 00:54.209
people don't greet me
properly anymore.

00:56.042 --> 01:00.334
Sadly, you're not the only one
who's not greeted properly.

01:01.084 --> 01:03.209
You arrive, and...

01:04.042 --> 01:05.709
I mean, no one does this anymore.

01:06.417 --> 01:07.584
It's disappeared.

01:08.001 --> 01:10.126
Apparently,
it's out of fashion.

01:10.542 --> 01:11.876
And I ask myself,

01:12.292 --> 01:14.292
is there any equivalent?

01:14.709 --> 01:18.334
There's nothing better
than the classic handshake...

01:18.501 --> 01:19.917
Not the handshake.

01:20.334 --> 01:23.667
I can understand if this
has become difficult,

01:24.626 --> 01:27.209
but if they'd just
lift it like this...

01:27.376 --> 01:29.334
Ever so slightly, like this...

01:29.542 --> 01:33.459
Wouldn't that be alright?
If you were just to...

01:33.626 --> 01:36.001
Of course,
I know just what you mean,

01:36.376 --> 01:38.751
but that's neither here nor there.

01:38.917 --> 01:40.209
True.
- You see.

01:40.626 --> 01:42.542
I've spit on you.
- Just a bit.

01:42.917 --> 01:44.126
Okay...

01:44.292 --> 01:47.001
Just a moment, it's no problem.

01:47.292 --> 01:49.667
One always has a tissue in the pocket.

01:49.876 --> 01:53.501
Held in your hand,
it's called a handkerchief.

02:37.459 --> 02:41.501
LOOK WHO'S BACK

02:44.751 --> 02:46.584
BASED ON THE NOVEL BY

02:51.001 --> 02:54.626
<i>The people have
surprised me most of all.</i>

02:57.292 --> 03:01.251
<i>I have truly done
all that is humanly possible</i>

03:01.459 --> 03:04.376
<i>in order to, on this
soil desecrated by the enemy,</i>

03:04.584 --> 03:07.709
<i>destroy the foundations
for a continued existence.</i>

03:10.251 --> 03:15.001
<i>By all rights, the German people
should have ceased to exist.</i>

03:16.667 --> 03:19.792
<i>They are, however, as I now realize,</i>

03:20.251 --> 03:21.959
<i>still here.</i>

03:25.584 --> 03:29.042
<i>To me, this seems
almost inconceivable.</i>

03:34.667 --> 03:36.834
<i>On the other hand,</i>

03:39.834 --> 03:41.542
<i>I'm here too.</i>

03:43.417 --> 03:46.501
<i>And that I understand just as little.</i>

03:52.834 --> 03:57.209
<i>The enemy
seems to have taken a respite.</i>

03:58.626 --> 04:01.584
<i>Above me
I can see no enemy aircraft.</i>

04:03.334 --> 04:05.584
<i>No thunder of artillery
can be heard.</i>

04:07.709 --> 04:11.292
<i>A bird
moves in the branches of a tree!</i>

04:12.459 --> 04:15.459
<i>It chirps. It sings.</i>

04:27.417 --> 04:29.292
<i>Physically, I am in good condition.</i>

04:29.459 --> 04:33.084
<i>I am fully healthy,
except for the headache.</i>

04:36.209 --> 04:38.542
<i>Is Dönitz lying around here too?</i>

04:50.751 --> 04:54.042
Who's that loser?
- Are you okay, mister?

04:59.126 --> 05:02.126
<i>Oh, the youth.
The youth is the future.</i>

05:03.709 --> 05:06.459
<i>Apparently, the youth is speechless.</i>

05:06.626 --> 05:08.417
<i>Yes, understandable.</i>

05:08.584 --> 05:10.751
<i>It is, after all, an unusual turn</i>

05:10.917 --> 05:14.001
<i>in the daily routine
of a not yet fully mature man,</i>

05:14.167 --> 05:17.084
<i>to experience the Führer firsthand.</i>

05:17.334 --> 05:20.126
Where's Bormann?
- Who the heck is that?

05:20.542 --> 05:22.334
Bormann, Martin.

05:22.834 --> 05:25.334
Never heard of him.
What's he look like?

05:25.709 --> 05:28.792
Like a Chief of Staff,
for God's sake.

05:28.959 --> 05:32.626
Boys, come back here.
We're not done with the shoot.

05:33.042 --> 05:34.876
Okay.
- Yeah, we're coming!

05:39.167 --> 05:41.251
Hitler youth Ronaldo!

05:42.126 --> 05:44.459
Which way is the street?

05:45.542 --> 05:48.501
Dude, what a retard!

05:48.959 --> 05:52.667
From the troubled hotspot Berlin-Mitte,
we're off to Marzahn

05:53.126 --> 05:56.542
and Hellersdorf,
where there is even more hardship.

06:00.626 --> 06:03.167
<i>I have to get back
to the Führer bunker.</i>

06:03.376 --> 06:07.084
<i>The youth here
are apparently not much help.</i>

06:28.167 --> 06:30.834
BRANDENBURG GATE

06:31.376 --> 06:33.209
<i>The rubble is gone,</i>

06:33.376 --> 06:39.292
<i>but the people
seem to have gone completely mad!</i>

06:50.917 --> 06:53.917
<i>Did I fall into a coma
and miss the victory?</i>

06:54.501 --> 06:58.667
<i>I know too little about my situation.
I need more information!</i>

06:58.834 --> 07:01.334
How do I get
to the Reichs Chancellery?

07:04.209 --> 07:06.042
Where is the Chancellery?

07:08.626 --> 07:09.917
Hitler kaputt!

07:10.292 --> 07:12.209
What... what is that?

07:12.417 --> 07:13.959
A photo.

07:14.417 --> 07:15.376
Where?

07:23.334 --> 07:26.042
Excuse me,
where is the Reichs Chancellery?

07:26.209 --> 07:28.084
Hey man, get lost.

07:28.667 --> 07:30.667
Please tell me where it is.

07:31.084 --> 07:34.376
The German people are at stake!
- Are you nuts?

07:34.792 --> 07:38.292
I can't speak, I'm a pantomime!
Find your own spot!

07:38.626 --> 07:39.917
Piss off! For real!

07:43.834 --> 07:45.626
<i>There is no doubt about it,</i>

07:45.792 --> 07:49.876
<i>something here had gotten
completely out of hand!</i>

07:58.584 --> 08:01.251
<i>Finally, a familiar element!</i>

08:01.667 --> 08:04.001
<i>A German mother
with her baby.</i>

08:05.251 --> 08:07.584
What date is it?

08:08.084 --> 08:09.459
Speak!

08:10.876 --> 08:13.584
What year is it?

08:30.542 --> 08:32.126
<i>I'd like a coffee.</i>

08:32.501 --> 08:34.001
<i>Anything else?</i>

08:43.167 --> 08:44.626
OCTOBER 23, 2014

08:47.792 --> 08:49.376
Now hold on there!

08:50.001 --> 08:52.167
<i>Hey, get your hands off that!</i>

09:02.667 --> 09:03.917
COMMERCIAL TV STATION

09:04.084 --> 09:05.709
Good morning!

09:06.667 --> 09:08.292
Good morning!

09:09.417 --> 09:11.001
Good morning!

09:20.376 --> 09:22.084
Someone's happy.
- Yes,

09:22.501 --> 09:24.376
and no wonder,
you always make me laugh.

09:25.751 --> 09:27.917
For joy.

09:28.126 --> 09:30.084
Not because you look like that.

09:30.501 --> 09:32.126
How do I look?
- So black.

09:32.292 --> 09:34.834
Because black is more like, sad,

09:35.042 --> 09:36.501
and when people laugh...

09:38.792 --> 09:40.042
Oh God, a rat!

09:40.959 --> 09:42.334
That's Jackie.

09:42.501 --> 09:45.292
You can't bring a rat here!
- Shh, only today.

09:45.626 --> 09:48.084
It's going to the vet later.
- It's sick?

09:48.251 --> 09:49.751
Just a little cold.

09:50.542 --> 09:51.667
Oh God!

09:52.126 --> 09:53.167
And...

09:54.209 --> 09:56.792
it's pregnant.
- Why's that?

09:57.209 --> 10:00.584
That big sack, the belly there.
- Those are his nuts.

10:01.959 --> 10:04.042
Rats collect nuts too?

10:05.209 --> 10:06.834
A TV network is like a ship.

10:07.376 --> 10:12.042
It can only survive bad weather,
storms and lulls

10:12.209 --> 10:14.334
if it has a good man at the helm.

10:14.584 --> 10:18.626
Christoph Sensenbrink,
as deputy head of the department,

10:19.084 --> 10:22.584
has done an excellent job.
Now we need... Yes.

10:26.417 --> 10:28.876
Now we need a long-term solution.

10:29.167 --> 10:31.417
Ladies and gentlemen...

10:31.584 --> 10:33.251
... the new managing director:

10:34.334 --> 10:36.251
Katja Bellini!

10:39.167 --> 10:40.417
Ha!

10:44.584 --> 10:45.626
I'm so excited!

10:46.042 --> 10:48.001
Good luck.
- Thank you.

10:48.167 --> 10:51.001
May you always find fair winds
and following seas!

10:51.167 --> 10:54.251
Don't screw it up.
- I won't.

10:54.709 --> 10:58.459
Thank you for this opportunity,
for your confidence, and

10:58.751 --> 11:02.251
I look forward to working
with each one of you. I say:

11:03.834 --> 11:06.334
Cast off!
Now let's get to work.

11:09.084 --> 11:10.501
Me too.

11:10.667 --> 11:12.626
And, what do you say?

11:18.251 --> 11:22.084
Mr. Kärrner, do you really believe...
- Christoph,

11:22.501 --> 11:24.834
you're still
Deputy Director.

11:25.667 --> 11:26.709
Deputy...

11:27.667 --> 11:28.792
Alright.

11:30.917 --> 11:32.084
Christoph...

11:32.501 --> 11:35.584
Congratulations.
- Thanks, that's nice of you.

11:38.376 --> 11:40.834
Sensenbrink asked for you.
- Yes.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.667
The next nasty rat.
- Jackie's not nasty.

11:44.042 --> 11:46.292
No, but Sensenbrink
sure is a curse.

11:46.459 --> 11:49.501
Look up "moron"
in Wikipedia, and guess what?

11:52.501 --> 11:55.917
You get a definition
of the word "moron"...

11:56.376 --> 11:58.459
... and soon, a picture of me.

12:01.376 --> 12:02.584
Come with me.

12:04.334 --> 12:06.792
You can't just fire me,
just like that!

12:06.959 --> 12:09.126
It's an austerity measure.

12:09.959 --> 12:15.667
And unfortunately, <i>unfortunately</i>,
it hits the freelancers first of all.

12:19.459 --> 12:21.292
Oh, Sawatzki...

12:21.667 --> 12:25.126
Look, you always
wanted to be a great filmmaker.

12:25.501 --> 12:27.917
And now you finally
get the chance.

12:30.501 --> 12:33.084
I have new footage.
It's a real scoop.

12:33.501 --> 12:34.917
A scoop?

12:35.167 --> 12:36.334
Go ahead then.

12:36.667 --> 12:40.751
Kids from the ghetto,
dad's an alcoholic... It's just so sad.

12:40.959 --> 12:43.792
But they all have one glimmer of hope,

12:44.584 --> 12:47.251
and that glimmer of hope
is soccer.

12:58.626 --> 13:00.292
Feeling better?

13:01.876 --> 13:03.126
What...

13:03.334 --> 13:05.251
... what year is it?

13:05.542 --> 13:07.709
2014, what did you think?

13:07.876 --> 13:09.376
1945?

13:09.584 --> 13:11.209
I have to...
- No, no!

13:13.167 --> 13:17.084
Stay seated.
- Is this a kidnapping?

13:17.876 --> 13:19.084
Yes!

13:23.584 --> 13:25.001
That was a good one!

13:27.501 --> 13:31.542
<i>Could this be an enemy
secret service playing a trick on me ?</i>

13:32.709 --> 13:36.584
<i>But then they would have
created a whole new world!</i>

13:36.751 --> 13:39.292
<i>One in which I can
move about freely.</i>

13:39.667 --> 13:40.959
<i>A parallel world!</i>

13:42.417 --> 13:44.542
<i>No, that is inconceivable.</i>

13:45.626 --> 13:49.542
<i>The enemy wouldn't have sent
this dumb newspaper monger.</i>

13:51.626 --> 13:53.876
<i>Perhaps I should kill him to be sure.</i>

13:54.417 --> 13:56.792
Eat this,
for your circulation.

13:56.959 --> 13:58.126
Go on, here.

13:59.001 --> 14:01.417
I don't want you fainting on me again.

14:21.959 --> 14:24.792
Industrially pressed grain.

14:25.209 --> 14:28.084
Are there still
supply shortages for bread?

14:28.834 --> 14:31.834
Are you shooting a film here somewhere?

14:32.959 --> 14:34.167
Shootng?

14:34.959 --> 14:39.792
Yes, television,
or a documentary or something.

14:42.042 --> 14:45.459
Do you always walk around like that?
- Actually, yes.

14:46.376 --> 14:48.376
This is surprisingly sweet.

14:49.126 --> 14:50.667
Amazing.

14:51.751 --> 14:53.042
Your whole stance.

14:56.126 --> 14:58.001
It's like you're really him.

14:58.167 --> 15:00.167
I'm really... who?

15:02.126 --> 15:03.709
The Führer.

15:03.876 --> 15:05.834
I am the Führer.

15:07.459 --> 15:09.084
You're crazy!

15:14.334 --> 15:17.709
Do you have
'Völkischer Beobachter' or 'Stürmer'?

15:18.084 --> 15:21.459
Haven't had those papers in a while.
- 'Panzerbär'?

15:23.209 --> 15:25.209
These are all Turkish.

15:25.376 --> 15:27.501
I get a lot of Turkish customers.

15:27.917 --> 15:29.959
Turks, in Berlin?

15:30.417 --> 15:32.334
How remarkable!

15:32.709 --> 15:35.292
The Ottoman Empire
managed to turn the war.

15:35.667 --> 15:39.042
I wouldn't have expected
such a feat from the Turks!

15:41.792 --> 15:44.251
"Is our life pre-determined?"

15:44.667 --> 15:47.792
"Who determines our fate?"

15:48.834 --> 15:51.042
I'd like to know that too.

15:52.417 --> 15:57.917
I would never have dreamed
fate would drop you on my doorstep.

15:58.084 --> 15:59.709
What did you say?

16:00.667 --> 16:02.417
Well, that fate...

16:02.876 --> 16:04.084
That's it!

16:04.334 --> 16:06.126
Fate.

16:06.709 --> 16:08.251
Destiny.

16:09.584 --> 16:13.667
Who else would destiny
have brought back?

16:15.834 --> 16:17.251
<i>Destiny, then.</i>

16:19.042 --> 16:21.459
<i>It tells me
to continue my fight.</i>

16:21.626 --> 16:25.209
You know,
my fate is not all that easy either.

16:25.376 --> 16:26.834
Quiet!

16:27.001 --> 16:31.251
<i>The first step
is always acquiring information.</i>

16:32.084 --> 16:35.626
<i>And a newspaper stand
is brimming with information.</i>

16:36.001 --> 16:38.876
<i>Apparently,
people thought I was dead.</i>

16:39.417 --> 16:41.126
<i>Over the past decades,</i>

16:41.584 --> 16:46.167
<i>many amateurs tried in vain
to get the public to grasp my work.</i>

16:48.209 --> 16:50.459
<i>It seems, the war was not won.</i>

16:50.834 --> 16:54.751
<i>The Russians divided the country
with the West, as once Poland with us.</i>

16:55.126 --> 16:57.626
<i>The so-called
Federal Republic of Germany</i>

16:58.001 --> 17:02.542
<i>is in the hands of a clumsy woman
with the charisma of a wet noodle.</i>

17:02.959 --> 17:08.251
<i>This matron joined forces
with the Bavarian Christian party:</i>

17:08.709 --> 17:12.291
<i>to form a pitiful copy
of National Socialism!</i>

17:13.876 --> 17:18.709
<i>The sight of the Social Democrats
filled my eyes with tears.</i>

17:19.084 --> 17:21.084
<i>Paul Löbe, Friedrich Ebert,</i>

17:21.459 --> 17:23.876
<i>Otto Wels...
All scoundrels.</i>

17:24.041 --> 17:26.416
<i>But scoundrels of stature!</i>

17:26.584 --> 17:30.126
<i>They can take our lives,
but not our honor!</i>

17:30.292 --> 17:33.542
<i>Today, the Social Democrats are led
by an obnoxious fatso</i>

17:33.751 --> 17:37.084
<i>and a docile farm hen!</i>
... knitting for change.

17:37.459 --> 17:41.751
<i>The only hope is an oddball party
called 'The Greens.'</i>

17:43.584 --> 17:46.209
<i>After the war,
industrialization caused</i>

17:46.584 --> 17:50.792
<i>terrible devastation
to land, air, soil and people.</i>

17:51.209 --> 17:53.917
<i>These Greens dedicated
themselves to the preservation</i>

17:54.376 --> 17:55.876
<i>of the German homeland.</i>

17:56.834 --> 17:57.959
<i>I say: Bravo!</i>

17:58.584 --> 18:02.501
<i>Their rejection of nuclear energy
was of course nonsense.</i>

18:03.001 --> 18:05.251
<i>You can't do without uranium!</i>

18:11.709 --> 18:13.792
Even Poland still exists.

18:14.751 --> 18:16.792
And on German territory, no less!

18:17.376 --> 18:19.584
The whole war was a waste!

18:26.459 --> 18:27.917
Alright, then.

18:28.792 --> 18:32.167
I have no problem if you
spend one or two nights here.

18:32.542 --> 18:35.084
Just don't
clean out my newspaper stand.

18:35.917 --> 18:39.459
Now you listen here.
Do I look like a criminal?

18:40.292 --> 18:42.959
You look like Adolf Hitler.

18:43.542 --> 18:44.709
Exactly.

18:49.042 --> 18:51.292
<i>Hotspot Berlin.</i>

18:51.751 --> 18:53.917
<i>Kids here have serious problems,</i>

18:54.126 --> 18:56.251
<i>but they have one ray of hope,</i>

18:56.584 --> 18:59.126
<i>and that ray of hope is: soccer.</i>

19:00.167 --> 19:02.667
<i>Just keep playing.
That's it.</i>

19:02.834 --> 19:06.042
<i>Hold up the ball. Like this.</i>
- Fabian.

19:06.209 --> 19:07.584
I believe in you.

19:07.751 --> 19:09.501
<i>But hurry up and come back.</i>

19:10.501 --> 19:13.584
<i>We've met their parents,
now let's meet them.</i>

19:14.167 --> 19:16.209
It's all trash.

19:17.959 --> 19:21.292
If I had a scoop,
they'd take me back.

19:21.584 --> 19:25.001
<i>... something we love,
something these kids love...</i>

19:25.417 --> 19:27.667
Who's that?
- Mom! That's me.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.126
No, back there.

19:38.959 --> 19:41.292
Looks like Hitler.

19:43.001 --> 19:44.709
In the middle of Berlin.

19:45.209 --> 19:47.376
That is a scoop.

19:57.376 --> 19:59.876
Oh my, what a smell in here.
- What?

20:02.417 --> 20:04.042
Push out the other rack.

20:04.917 --> 20:06.209
Well?

20:06.417 --> 20:08.709
Now I even have to work.

20:08.876 --> 20:12.001
Really now! Sits around here all day!

20:16.501 --> 20:18.959
Yesterday I was moving
the 12th Army.

20:19.417 --> 20:21.084
Today it's a newspaper rack!

20:24.251 --> 20:27.584
Say, is that smell coming from you?

20:28.917 --> 20:32.417
Really, you've got to
take that thing to the cleaners.

20:38.084 --> 20:39.959
25... 30...

20:40.126 --> 20:42.001
PINARBASI EXPRESS CLEANING

20:42.167 --> 20:43.876
... and 2.40.

20:45.876 --> 20:48.042
There you go. 28.
- Thank you.

20:50.542 --> 20:53.042
I'm relieved.
- I believe it.

20:56.834 --> 20:59.251
Bye.
- See you next week.

20:59.417 --> 21:01.126
Good bye.
- Hello.

21:06.042 --> 21:09.751
Hello.
- I'd like my uniform cleaned.

21:12.417 --> 21:14.626
May I?

21:15.751 --> 21:18.042
It reeks like a foxhole!

21:21.417 --> 21:25.917
All of it?
- Yes, it all has to be cleaned.

21:27.126 --> 21:28.584
Yes...

21:32.917 --> 21:36.042
No, not underwear!
- This too, please?

21:37.001 --> 21:38.042
No.

21:38.417 --> 21:41.751
But it's also quite...
- No. No. That stays on.

21:42.167 --> 21:44.834
Is completely filthy.
- And what now?

21:45.001 --> 21:46.917
Clean it.
- I'm sorry.

21:47.834 --> 21:51.792
Coat... and pants.

21:52.501 --> 21:54.584
Men's pants.

21:54.917 --> 21:57.292
Coat, 5 euros.
- And underwear.

21:57.459 --> 22:00.501
Underwear?
Underwear me no do!

22:01.251 --> 22:03.376
Please do the underwear as well.
- Oh my!

22:03.542 --> 22:06.792
I can't walk around
wearing this anymore.

22:10.459 --> 22:14.126
Oh my.
Those are pants, that's 3 euros.

22:15.084 --> 22:17.084
And here you go, your slip.

22:17.417 --> 22:20.292
What watch you come?
You are?

22:20.542 --> 22:23.751
What?
- What watch? Tomorrow.

22:24.001 --> 22:25.542
What watch is coming?
- Yes.

22:25.959 --> 22:27.667
Why is a watch coming?

22:28.084 --> 22:31.792
10 o'clock, 11 o'clock...
- Early. When do you open?

22:32.042 --> 22:33.209
9.
- All right.

22:33.542 --> 22:36.751
9 o'clock too early!
A little later come.

22:37.251 --> 22:39.626
When?
- When. 12. 12!

22:40.251 --> 22:41.667
Here you go.

22:42.084 --> 22:44.667
Oh!
- I can't go out like this.

22:45.042 --> 22:46.584
Yes, I know.
- Yes.

22:49.042 --> 22:53.209
Do you have something?
Another uniform for me?

23:01.959 --> 23:03.084
Come on!

23:03.251 --> 23:05.417
What is it?
- Come on. Here he is!

23:05.584 --> 23:07.417
Here.
- Who is this?

23:07.751 --> 23:12.042
This young man has been
looking for you all morning.

23:12.376 --> 23:15.459
From TV. Commercial TV.
Isn't that correct?

23:15.626 --> 23:17.209
Yes, of course. Uh...

23:17.834 --> 23:20.626
Sawatzki, Fabian.
- Hitler, Adolf.

23:21.084 --> 23:22.334
German Reich.

23:23.417 --> 23:26.001
Your manager said
you have a program?

23:26.501 --> 23:28.376
Of course I have a program.

23:28.876 --> 23:32.876
Then say something like,
"Since 5:45 we are returning fire!"

23:33.584 --> 23:34.626
Like that?

23:35.042 --> 23:37.084
If you are quoting my speech,

23:37.917 --> 23:40.042
you must know
how it continues.

23:40.417 --> 23:42.917
There's more?
- I'm listening.

23:47.126 --> 23:51.501
From now on, we shall
repay bomb for bomb!

23:52.084 --> 23:54.084
What do you know about Poland?

23:54.751 --> 23:57.584
Uh, Poland...
The capital is Warsaw...

23:58.042 --> 24:01.709
Just facts from a book.
A paper moth can digest that.

24:03.167 --> 24:04.459
How about real knowledge?

24:04.626 --> 24:09.126
You have 1.4 million men and
only 30 days to take the whole country.

24:09.292 --> 24:11.876
Why only 30 clays?
- Where do you attack?

24:13.667 --> 24:16.334
And how do you
keep the Romanians quiet?

24:16.667 --> 24:19.001
The Romanians?
- Oh, pardon me.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.876
Who cares about the Romanians?

24:24.501 --> 24:28.334
General Sawatzki,
he looks neither left nor right.

24:28.501 --> 24:32.084
He just starts marching,
that General Sawatzki.

24:32.251 --> 24:34.209
Poland is an easy foe!

24:34.917 --> 24:36.334
But what's this?

24:36.667 --> 24:41.584
Suddenly, our army has lots of
small holes in its back.

24:42.292 --> 24:46.917
And out of those holes flows and oozes
the blood of German heroes.

24:48.209 --> 24:53.376
Has our General perhaps forgotten
about the Polish-Romanian alliance?

24:56.292 --> 25:00.917
You, Sawatzki, could not find the way
to Poland for any army in the world!

25:01.084 --> 25:06.126
You cannot even find the way
into your own uniform!

25:06.667 --> 25:10.167
I, on the other hand,
I know at all times where mine is!

25:10.626 --> 25:12.542
It's at the cleaner's!

25:16.084 --> 25:17.792
Sorry. Now that...

25:18.126 --> 25:21.834
You really had me there.
You prepared that, didn't you?

25:22.501 --> 25:26.376
Yes, of course.
We had it all planned out since June.

25:26.834 --> 25:28.626
You can tell. It's...

25:29.209 --> 25:33.501
How lucky that you've found me.
This is my, I mean, your chance.

25:34.417 --> 25:36.042
I'll make you huge.

25:36.376 --> 25:39.834
You march through modern Germany,
and I'll film you.

25:40.001 --> 25:42.042
I like that idea.

25:42.792 --> 25:45.001
Say, your uniform...

25:45.417 --> 25:49.001
You'll have it back by tomorrow?
- Yes, of course.

25:49.584 --> 25:52.167
Good.
- Yes, it's a blitz cleaning.

25:56.001 --> 25:57.876
Oh God! Blitz?

25:58.959 --> 26:02.876
Oh God. I'm sorry.
How embarrassing.

26:03.584 --> 26:05.459
I'm really very sorry.

26:08.792 --> 26:10.834
You were completely right.

26:11.584 --> 26:14.126
He is really sensational.

26:14.792 --> 26:17.626
And he's not even acting, he's...

26:18.376 --> 26:20.334
... it's just who he is.

26:21.501 --> 26:24.209
Who are you talking about?
- Adolf Hitler.

26:24.376 --> 26:26.126
Oh yes, how nice.

26:26.751 --> 26:29.167
The only thing I'm missing is money.

26:29.876 --> 26:32.584
It doesn't have to be a lot either,
but...

26:33.417 --> 26:35.792
Just... just a little...

26:39.959 --> 26:43.626
Mom, the money
is a really good investment.

26:46.834 --> 26:49.709
Do you need your car
in the next few days?

26:54.584 --> 26:56.501
<i>That</i> is the vehicle?

26:57.001 --> 27:00.084
Yes, I...
- But that is no vehicle.

27:00.417 --> 27:02.001
I know it's not...

27:02.209 --> 27:06.501
It doesn't have anti-mine armor!
- But I have clothes for you.

27:06.667 --> 27:11.167
Sawatzki, I should have you
lined up against the wall for this!

27:12.334 --> 27:15.751
Why are you laughing?
Do you think this is funny?

27:18.167 --> 27:23.792
It is in moments like these
that I sorely miss my SS.

27:23.959 --> 27:26.292
Let's go.
- Excuse me...

27:26.751 --> 27:30.917
You still have to pay for the papers
and the chocolate. 26 euros 40.

27:31.376 --> 27:33.084
26 euros, ah.

27:35.084 --> 27:39.167
You have rendered your fatherland
a great service.

27:39.334 --> 27:42.209
This glorious moment is something

27:42.376 --> 27:44.792
you'll share with your grandchildren.

27:44.959 --> 27:48.209
And that is priceless.
Farewell.

28:05.376 --> 28:07.751
So what's your real name?

28:07.959 --> 28:10.042
Adolf Hitler! Like I told you!

28:10.459 --> 28:12.667
Really?
- Yes, really.

28:14.292 --> 28:16.084
What a coincidence.

28:16.751 --> 28:21.417
Oh please, you have a name too.
I don't say, "Oh, what a coincidence!"

28:22.376 --> 28:25.792
And you look like him.
The moustache, the hair...

28:25.959 --> 28:28.876
... your language.
It's exactly the same.

28:29.042 --> 28:32.459
And do you look much different
than your name?

28:34.376 --> 28:36.667
I guess you're right.

28:40.417 --> 28:42.542
The Führer in Northern Germany,

28:42.876 --> 28:46.584
where wind and waves
crash against the cliffs of Sylt...

28:48.167 --> 28:50.167
There he is, the Führer.

28:50.876 --> 28:52.792
Gazing out to sea...

28:53.292 --> 28:55.667
... thinking perhaps of England.

28:56.334 --> 29:00.834
<i>People in a creative crisis

29:01.001 --> 29:04.292
<i>Sawatzki wanted to film
"The Führer at the Bank,"</i>

29:04.459 --> 29:06.126
<i>or "The Führer by the Sea."</i>

29:06.292 --> 29:08.751
<i>With me in a bathing suit!</i>

29:09.876 --> 29:12.459
<i>Goebbels would've

29:16.626 --> 29:19.167
Something wrong with the television?

29:24.126 --> 29:25.251
<i>Vegetables.</i>

29:25.834 --> 29:27.334
That is a television?

29:27.959 --> 29:29.417
Yes.

29:30.792 --> 29:33.459
What advanced technology!

29:34.709 --> 29:37.167
What splendid means of propaganda.

29:37.917 --> 29:41.417
But why is it showing a cook?
There must be...

29:41.876 --> 29:47.709
... something more interesting in
Germany or in the world than this cook!

29:48.792 --> 29:49.917
Not at this hour.

29:50.917 --> 29:55.167
<i>Eileen discovers her favorite dish:
Red jelly with vanilla sauce!</i>

29:56.542 --> 29:59.001
<i>What a treat...
- Delicious...</i>

<i>The blood sausage...
- And with my best friend!</i>

30:11.542 --> 30:14.709
<i>Shit, I was hoping to have sex!
But I guess not.</i>

30:15.167 --> 30:17.792
<i>So I threatened him

30:18.251 --> 30:21.209
What blatant nonsense this is!

30:21.376 --> 30:23.876
And that court matron just nods away!

30:24.251 --> 30:26.501
And with an earnest expression!

30:26.917 --> 30:29.167
It's a good thing Goebbels
can't see this!

30:29.501 --> 30:32.292
<i>You accepted a bribe
from my wife as well!</i>

30:32.459 --> 30:37.792
Makes you really want to mow down
this scum with an 8.8 flak gun!

30:40.792 --> 30:45.376
<i>It was now clear to me what
I'd address in Sawatzki's TV reports:</i>

30:46.084 --> 30:47.251
<i>Politics.</i>

30:47.626 --> 30:50.542
We're traveling the country,
asking people

30:50.876 --> 30:54.959
about issues of importance,
about where the shoe pinches.

30:55.167 --> 30:56.751
Oh, I see.

30:56.917 --> 31:01.209
Well, I think the shoe pinches most
when it comes to wages.

31:01.584 --> 31:05.959
Do you have the feeling
you have a say in democracy?

31:06.126 --> 31:09.417
No. And honestly, I don't vote.
Out of principle.

31:09.584 --> 31:14.709
I still think the elections are
manipulated. Nothing changes.

31:15.292 --> 31:17.751
I come from the former East,

31:17.917 --> 31:21.959
and we had to put our X
where it belonged.

31:22.126 --> 31:27.584
I think that now somebody puts the X
somewhere else afterwards. Really.

31:28.042 --> 31:31.292
Yes, and people are afraid
to talk about it.

31:31.459 --> 31:36.001
You can't say anything either.
If you do, they'll call you xenophobic.

31:36.376 --> 31:39.459
The immigrant kids
around here are just awful.

31:39.626 --> 31:42.459
They throw things at the window.

31:42.626 --> 31:45.709
If I say anything,
the parents might stab me.

31:46.042 --> 31:48.626
That's right.
I will take care of it.

31:49.459 --> 31:51.584
May I take a photo of you.
- Sure.

31:51.917 --> 31:54.751
My name is Annett, by the way.
- Adolf, hello.

31:54.917 --> 31:56.584
<i>It was as I suspected:</i>

31:56.751 --> 32:02.251
<i>During my absence, democracy had only
left a minimal impact on people.</i>

32:02.751 --> 32:07.709
Well, a lot could be changed.
- Like what, for example?

32:08.126 --> 32:11.292
Labor camps.
- Indeed, labor camps.

32:11.709 --> 32:13.876
That's how I am.
- Me too.

32:14.042 --> 32:15.667
I say it like it is.
- Of course.

32:16.084 --> 32:18.459
I'll take care of the camps.
- Good.

32:19.042 --> 32:21.751
I will.
- I'll help you with that.

32:23.667 --> 32:27.001
It's a problem we have in Germany too.

32:27.167 --> 32:29.376
What problems
does Germany have?

32:29.542 --> 32:34.167
Well, all those bearded folks,
the ones who are suspicious

32:34.334 --> 32:36.792
should be kicked out,
to wherever.

32:36.959 --> 32:39.667
They should head back.
- Home.

32:39.959 --> 32:42.709
Some were born here, but still.

32:42.876 --> 32:46.792
Where their parents come from.
- And they should stay there.

32:47.251 --> 32:49.834
Who are you talking about?
- The Salafists.

32:50.001 --> 32:52.417
The Salafists?
- Yes, get rid of them!

32:52.751 --> 32:55.126
<i>There was a silent anger,</i>

32:55.292 --> 32:59.001
<i>a discontent among the people
that reminded me of 1930.</i>

32:59.167 --> 33:04.376
<i>Only back then there wasn't the fitting
term for it: political disenchantment.</i>

33:05.376 --> 33:08.501
He who knows people, loves animals.
- True.

33:09.167 --> 33:11.876
Where do you
see the problems in Germany?

33:13.084 --> 33:16.126
That more and more immigrants
are arriving,

33:16.501 --> 33:18.709
I don't think that's so great.

33:19.667 --> 33:22.709
But little people like us,
can't change a thing.

33:23.084 --> 33:27.001
But when many little people,
little men and little women,

33:27.167 --> 33:30.126
come together
to elect one big, strong person,

33:30.292 --> 33:34.459
then you could change something.
- That's true.

33:35.001 --> 33:38.459
Mixing the races
doesn't work either.

33:39.084 --> 33:43.501
Take the German Shepherd, a purebred.
- Right.

33:43.667 --> 33:48.376
And if you mix the German Shepherd
with a Dachshund, what do you get?

33:50.126 --> 33:52.001
A Shepherd-Dachshund.

33:52.834 --> 33:55.792
And how does that look?
- Funny.

33:56.251 --> 33:57.792
And now just imagine

33:58.334 --> 34:01.584
that two Shepherd-Dachshunds
would mate.

34:02.251 --> 34:04.667
That's it
for the German Shepherd.

34:04.834 --> 34:07.709
The German Shepherd
is completely lost.

34:08.333 --> 34:10.917
Correct.
- The race is gone.

34:11.083 --> 34:14.876
That's what's happening in Germany.
- Exactly.

34:15.292 --> 34:19.501
The IQ quotient of people from Africa...

34:19.917 --> 34:22.126
Just from Africa.
- Yes.

34:22.292 --> 34:26.333
...t hat come here to Germany
is between 40 and 50.

34:27.042 --> 34:29.833
Here in Germany
we used to have over 80.

34:30.126 --> 34:33.417
You mean the intelligence quotient
was once 80?

34:33.667 --> 34:37.417
80 and higher.
- And what is it now?

34:37.876 --> 34:44.167
I'd say the IQ is around 60 percent
at most, at the very most!

34:44.667 --> 34:47.626
But the more immigrants
flood the country,

34:47.792 --> 34:50.208
the lower...
- The lower the IQ gets.

34:50.376 --> 34:52.542
Yes, it's true!
- You're so right.

34:53.251 --> 34:56.626
I'll tell you one thing,
and I swear to you:

34:56.792 --> 35:00.334
I'd have myself shot
for my Fatherland, if necessary.

35:00.667 --> 35:04.209
<i>It sufficed to put out
a few keywords as bait,</i>

35:04.667 --> 35:07.376
<i>and soon I had them
wriggling on the line.</i>

35:07.709 --> 35:10.876
Just think of Ebola.
We didn't have that before.

35:11.042 --> 35:14.876
Now that so many are coming,
we have our first Ebola death.

35:15.501 --> 35:16.876
Yes, of course.

35:17.042 --> 35:19.334
And how do you think that happens?

35:19.501 --> 35:23.251
Because we Germans
are not allowed to open our mouths,

35:23.417 --> 35:26.709
because we still have that stigma.

35:27.667 --> 35:31.251
I have to honestly say,
that's not my opinion.

35:32.126 --> 35:35.459
I'm very resolute.
I'm not a radical,

35:35.876 --> 35:39.459
but I will always stand on the right.
Always.

35:39.876 --> 35:43.667
Those politicians just
pocket the money for themselves.

35:45.126 --> 35:49.209
And I'm surprised that
the millions of people like you

35:50.209 --> 35:53.292
don't go to Parliament
with pitchforks to demand:

35:53.459 --> 35:55.876
"What are you doing with our money?"

35:56.626 --> 35:59.584
<i>But the German per se
is not a revolutionary.</i>

35:59.959 --> 36:01.751
Would you follow me too?

36:02.001 --> 36:05.501
Well, right now isn't such a good time,
I have to get to work.

36:07.709 --> 36:10.251
How did Hitler
get that moustache?

36:10.417 --> 36:11.626
The war.

36:12.459 --> 36:14.709
I clipped it
to fit it in a gas mask.

36:18.042 --> 36:20.084
How was it before?
Was it...

36:20.251 --> 36:25.084
... like those big Wilhelminian
mutton chops?

36:25.501 --> 36:27.209
Out to here.
- Exactly.

36:27.376 --> 36:29.042
You had one of those?
- Yes.

36:29.209 --> 36:32.584
Then came the gas attack,
so I clipped it, and it fit.

36:32.917 --> 36:35.417
That's a good story you came up with.

36:35.792 --> 36:38.084
You know what?
We'll get you a dog.

36:38.417 --> 36:42.709
Yes, a nice big German Shepherd.
- Uh, exactly.

36:44.042 --> 36:46.459
Can they do anything besides run?

36:46.876 --> 36:49.001
They can sit, lie down...

36:49.167 --> 36:52.251
I breed dogs for families.
"PULSHOF" DOG BREEDERS

36:52.417 --> 36:54.626
I always say,
my dogs are my kids.

36:55.084 --> 36:58.584
A problem child.
I found it, took care of it,

36:58.751 --> 37:01.792
He's actually quite cute,
the little guy.

37:04.167 --> 37:06.167
Now come to uncle!

37:06.542 --> 37:09.292
You little...
you little cute thing, you.

37:09.626 --> 37:12.834
Uncle always loved dogs so much,
yes he did!

37:15.292 --> 37:16.542
Her name's Sweetie.

37:16.959 --> 37:19.417
Could we borrow one of these dogs?

37:20.126 --> 37:21.876
Borrow?
- Borrow.

37:22.417 --> 37:23.751
I don't even know you.

37:23.917 --> 37:25.542
That takes trust.
- Yes.

37:27.876 --> 37:31.251
They're very sensitive.
- We'd take good care of it.

37:31.626 --> 37:35.584
The Führer really loves animals,
he knows animals.

37:36.126 --> 37:38.334
He gets on their level,

37:38.751 --> 37:41.042
and they like him.
- Get off, beast!

37:41.376 --> 37:46.501
I see it with him all the time,
animals come up to him and...

37:50.751 --> 37:53.251
Was that really necessary?

37:53.417 --> 37:57.209
Yes!
It was the only language he understood!

37:57.459 --> 37:59.667
Give me the gun.
- No. It's mine.

37:59.834 --> 38:02.917
You can't walk around
with a loaded pistol!

38:03.084 --> 38:07.292
You can really overdo it
with this method acting! I'm keeping it.

38:09.417 --> 38:11.792
What is this noise?

38:13.459 --> 38:16.292
What is this... this noise?

38:16.459 --> 38:18.376
It's, it's hip hop.

38:19.417 --> 38:21.542
"Nigger, nigger."

38:21.709 --> 38:23.376
What's that about?

38:23.709 --> 38:26.417
It's kind of like praise.

38:27.792 --> 38:29.709
Praise?
- Yes.

38:29.876 --> 38:34.334
What nonsense! Nigger is a swearword,
for Negro, any child knows that.

38:34.876 --> 38:37.584
Do you think I was born yesterday?
- No.

38:37.751 --> 38:41.251
"Nigger" means something like
friend, brother...

38:42.376 --> 38:44.251
Just nigger: Friend.

38:44.876 --> 38:46.001
Friend?
- Yes.

38:46.167 --> 38:47.667
Nigger?

38:53.292 --> 38:55.084
Hey, nigger!
- Ah!

38:55.792 --> 38:58.084
How you doing, nigger?
- Get it away!

38:58.251 --> 39:00.292
That's so gross!
- What's wrong?

39:00.667 --> 39:02.501
Get that... Yuck!

39:04.334 --> 39:05.667
Yuck!

39:08.251 --> 39:10.584
Get a hold of yourself!

39:13.209 --> 39:16.334
Completely soft in the belly
and degenerate!

39:16.542 --> 39:18.417
But just wait.

39:18.834 --> 39:20.667
I'll make a man out of you.

39:23.709 --> 39:25.626
It's only a dead dog.

39:26.042 --> 39:30.209
It has to be sent by registered...
- Later, not now!

39:35.542 --> 39:38.501
That fucking housefly.

39:39.792 --> 39:42.126
Sawatzki, what is it now?

39:42.292 --> 39:44.126
I'm in the middle of a shoot.

39:44.542 --> 39:46.667
It'll be a major scoop.
- Bye.

39:46.834 --> 39:49.667
No, please.
Just give me a chance.

39:50.084 --> 39:51.959
It'll knock your socks off.

39:52.876 --> 39:56.209
If you don't like it,
I'll never call you again.

39:56.376 --> 39:58.459
Just give me a chance, please!

39:58.834 --> 40:00.626
Okay, last chance.

40:01.751 --> 40:04.459
Thanks. We just have
one small problem.

40:04.876 --> 40:09.376
And that is, our money has run out,
and... I need my expenses covered.

40:09.542 --> 40:13.417
It's a very bad connection.
- You could transfer it to...

40:15.251 --> 40:18.334
You're shaking your phone
and stuttering.

40:20.042 --> 40:21.417
Shit.

40:35.251 --> 40:36.751
What did you do?

40:40.209 --> 40:42.376
I tried to kick a pesky fly.

40:42.709 --> 40:46.751
That's my mother's car.
Are you insane? We have no money!

40:47.501 --> 40:50.959
What do we do now?
- Don't be a whiner, Sawatzki!

40:51.126 --> 40:55.501
What do you think I would've become
if I hadn't gone into politics?

40:57.959 --> 40:59.167
A painter.

40:59.667 --> 41:01.876
PORTRAITS
DONATION WELCOME

41:12.501 --> 41:14.001
Hello, there.

41:14.376 --> 41:16.792
Feel like
having your portrait drawn?

41:16.959 --> 41:19.126
Have what drawn?
- A portrait.

41:19.376 --> 41:20.834
Of Hitler?
- Of you.

41:27.751 --> 41:28.792
I'm finished.

41:34.792 --> 41:36.376
A caricature.

41:37.876 --> 41:39.584
Looks just like you.

41:48.084 --> 41:50.334
Do you like it?
- Yes.

41:51.001 --> 41:54.501
I'm afraid to say no.
- How do you see yourself?

41:55.417 --> 41:57.709
As a vagabond.
- A vagabond?

41:57.876 --> 41:58.959
Yes.

42:00.251 --> 42:04.584
I've given it extra effort.
This is what happens to vagabonds.

42:04.959 --> 42:07.959
And those are the tears
that you will cry.

42:08.834 --> 42:11.042
Hang the picture at home, and...

42:11.209 --> 42:13.376
hang yourself next to it.
- I will.

42:13.959 --> 42:16.626
And today, in the year 2014,

42:16.792 --> 42:20.417
if someone comes
to the central square in Bayreuth,

42:21.126 --> 42:23.917
impersonating Hitler,

42:24.584 --> 42:27.709
and if that is tolerated
by the general public,

42:28.251 --> 42:31.626
then I have to say:
That is bad for Germany.

42:32.292 --> 42:36.459
And if it were up to me,
I would have you chased off.

42:37.209 --> 42:40.334
So much for the idea
that nobody would donate.

42:44.709 --> 42:46.876
Are you married, Sawatzki?

42:47.417 --> 42:49.417
No.
- I thought as much.

42:49.834 --> 42:53.834
What's that supposed to mean?
- It takes courage to get women.

42:54.292 --> 42:56.876
And that's exactly what you lack.

42:57.709 --> 43:00.834
You don't win over women
by hemming and hawing.

43:01.876 --> 43:04.959
Instead, you must
focus all your strength,

43:05.126 --> 43:08.001
and then, Sawatzki,
then you attack!

43:09.459 --> 43:13.709
You could write a self-help book:
"Mein Kampf... with my wife."

43:34.334 --> 43:36.584
I like you, Sawatzki.

43:39.417 --> 43:40.709
Come on.

43:41.084 --> 43:43.501
Touch the fence.

43:44.584 --> 43:46.251
You're afraid.
Come on.

43:57.709 --> 43:59.709
It's nothing.

44:09.876 --> 44:11.667
I didn't feel a thing.

44:18.084 --> 44:19.917
This is so beautiful.

44:28.334 --> 44:30.751
You must know me from the '30s.

44:31.209 --> 44:33.792
I was just thinking,
"I know that man."

44:33.959 --> 44:37.334
She just told me,
"He looks like..."?

44:37.501 --> 44:38.876
Hitler.
- Exactly.

44:40.417 --> 44:41.501
And it is me.

44:41.876 --> 44:44.626
Do you like the Bavarian conservative party?
- Not anymore.

44:45.126 --> 44:48.376
So who do you like?
- I'd go with the Greens.

44:48.876 --> 44:50.042
The Greens?
- Yes.

44:50.209 --> 44:51.709
That would be good.

44:51.876 --> 44:54.667
Protecting nature
protects the homeland.

44:54.834 --> 44:58.084
Protecting nature is good
and a Christian value.

44:58.834 --> 45:04.126
It wasn't all bad back then.
- No, you can't say that.

45:04.292 --> 45:06.459
But politics made it bad.

45:06.876 --> 45:09.751
You can't go lamenting about the past.

45:10.167 --> 45:13.709
Sure you can.
You have to learn from the past,

45:13.876 --> 45:16.876
and it can't ever
be allowed to repeat itself.

45:17.334 --> 45:20.084
It won't,
this time we'll do it right!

45:20.251 --> 45:24.001
What you think is naive.
- It's not at all naive.

45:24.167 --> 45:26.126
We'll do it right this time.

45:26.584 --> 45:29.959
You should support me. Would you?
- Definitely not.

45:30.751 --> 45:33.292
I would never.
- Do you have a pen?

45:35.042 --> 45:37.834
I'd like to get his address.

45:38.292 --> 45:41.876
It's for the first wave of arrests.
Then we'll see.

45:42.042 --> 45:44.292
I'm not afraid.

45:45.126 --> 45:47.751
I love you, Germany!

46:35.376 --> 46:37.292
Oh, that... that stings!

46:40.126 --> 46:41.792
Take it off!

46:42.917 --> 46:44.417
It burns!

46:45.792 --> 46:48.001
WORLD CUP FAN ZONE

46:53.584 --> 46:56.292
Fuck Germany!
You're all fucking Nazis!

46:56.667 --> 46:58.792
Shit!
- You going to take that?

47:01.334 --> 47:04.292
Fucking traitor!
- Hang him from that tree!

47:05.084 --> 47:07.667
This is what happens
to parasites!

47:11.542 --> 47:13.417
Down with Germany!

47:13.584 --> 47:16.042
Don't put up with it!
Let him have it!

47:23.126 --> 47:27.126
Take a picture of me and Adolf.
- Okay, I will.

47:31.001 --> 47:32.751
I love Hitler!

47:32.917 --> 47:35.584
May I hug you?
- It would be my pleasure.

47:35.751 --> 47:36.792
Thanks!

47:36.959 --> 47:39.042
"Hitler's walking around."

47:40.959 --> 47:45.626
"He's really into 'The Downfall'."
- "Looks good for his age."

47:53.667 --> 47:57.501
Sawatzki,
you are really scaring me. Really.

47:58.709 --> 48:01.084
This clip
has over a million clicks!

48:01.459 --> 48:04.542
How many?
- Over a million, and I just put it up.

48:04.792 --> 48:06.292
I've got more footage.

48:06.459 --> 48:07.876
No way.
- Yes.

48:08.667 --> 48:11.959
It's bold, it's provocative, it's...

48:13.626 --> 48:16.042
In your face, you know...

48:16.209 --> 48:17.251
Sorry.

48:18.376 --> 48:19.709
What do you think?

48:21.417 --> 48:24.584
Have you talked to anyone else about it?
- No.

48:24.751 --> 48:27.709
Good.
Give me the contact and the footage.

48:27.876 --> 48:30.251
Not necessary, he's already here.

48:30.459 --> 48:34.251
Who?
- Adolf Hitler. Hello.

48:35.167 --> 48:36.292
Sensen...

48:37.292 --> 48:39.126
... brink. Hello.

48:40.084 --> 48:42.917
Sawatzki, come with me, please.

48:45.209 --> 48:46.584
This is no circus.

48:46.751 --> 48:50.584
Let me spell it out
in case you're slow on the uptake:

48:50.959 --> 48:54.667
Take that lunatic and get out.
- Hitler, don't go in there!

48:56.376 --> 48:58.751
Mr. Hitler, you can't just...
- <i>That's really getting old...</i>

48:59.084 --> 49:02.417
Mr. Sensenbrink!
- Sorry, he just charged in...

49:02.584 --> 49:05.751
Are we that desperate?
- Not you!

49:07.834 --> 49:10.251
I think you're right.
- About what?

49:11.584 --> 49:13.542
Our situation is desperate.

49:14.501 --> 49:17.376
Let us save Germany together.

49:17.876 --> 49:21.292
Great idea, the show's over.
- Hold on a second.

49:21.751 --> 49:24.084
How do you plan on saving Germany?

49:24.917 --> 49:26.334
Do you drink coffee?

49:28.542 --> 49:29.626
Occasionally.

49:35.459 --> 49:36.584
You!

49:37.876 --> 49:41.334
Do you drink coffee?
- Yes.

49:41.501 --> 49:43.501
Where does your coffee come from?

49:43.667 --> 49:45.376
Usually from Starbucks.

49:45.542 --> 49:47.751
And who is responsible for it?

49:50.876 --> 49:53.376
For the preservatives
they put in it?

49:53.542 --> 49:57.667
Surely not Mr. Starbuck.
He wants nothing to do with it.

49:58.334 --> 50:01.126
Nobody wants anything to do with it.
- True.

50:01.792 --> 50:03.667
That's why we need a change.

50:04.001 --> 50:07.126
A leader who is responsible for things,
body and soul.

50:07.792 --> 50:09.792
Germany needs to know:

50:10.251 --> 50:13.167
The Autobahn
was not built by some fool!

50:13.792 --> 50:16.417
No, it was built by the Führer!

50:17.001 --> 50:20.459
When you eat bread,
you know it comes from the baker.

50:21.292 --> 50:23.751
And if you invade
what's left of the Czech Republic,

50:23.917 --> 50:26.126
then you know
it was the fuhrer.

50:30.334 --> 50:33.209
Is this something you've prepared?

50:33.626 --> 50:35.667
What for, Mrs. Bellini?

50:35.834 --> 50:37.667
The bedrock foundation of my world view

50:37.834 --> 50:40.834
enables me
to draw the right conclusions.

50:41.001 --> 50:43.001
Amazing. Mr. Sensenbrink,

50:43.417 --> 50:46.667
find the proper TV format
for this gentleman.

50:46.834 --> 50:47.917
Of course.

50:49.667 --> 50:51.209
Just one thing, Mr. ...

50:51.751 --> 50:52.917
Hitler.
- Yes.

50:53.292 --> 50:56.917
We do agree:
the topic of Jews is not funny.

50:57.709 --> 51:00.084
How right you are,
Mrs. Bellini.

51:05.459 --> 51:08.917
<i>I've rarely encountered
such splendid women.</i>

51:09.459 --> 51:14.251
<i>Riefenstahl was one,
and this Bellini is of similar caliber.</i>

51:14.792 --> 51:17.542
<i>Her tight body stands upright,</i>

51:18.001 --> 51:21.959
<i>she is alert, ready with
a quick and correct response.</i>

51:22.126 --> 51:24.667
<i>Like a wolf lying in wait.</i>

51:27.251 --> 51:30.667
<i>In tense situations,
she may take a longer drag</i>

51:30.834 --> 51:32.959
<i>from her electronic cigarette.</i>

51:33.376 --> 51:36.417
<i>But otherwise, she 's under control.
What a woman!</i>

51:37.292 --> 51:40.376
And? How did it go?
- As expected.

51:43.917 --> 51:46.417
Mr. Sensenbrink?
How was it?

51:46.584 --> 51:48.334
What?
- In the office?

51:48.501 --> 51:51.667
Oh. Just fine.
- Then I'm back in?

51:51.834 --> 51:54.917
I'm bursting with ideas.
- I'll get in touch.

51:55.084 --> 51:59.376
Hold on. You have to hire me back,
or else I'm taking Hitler with me.

52:02.834 --> 52:07.459
Sure. I'll make sure you get a job
that carries some weight.

52:09.042 --> 52:10.334
Thank you.

52:14.459 --> 52:15.501
There you go.

52:15.917 --> 52:17.542
Sensenbrink said it's temporary,

52:17.709 --> 52:20.459
until a new editorial spot opens up.

52:22.167 --> 52:27.126
I have to say,
that new comedian is really something.

52:27.667 --> 52:30.626
It's hard to believe
he's not the real thing.

52:32.126 --> 52:33.834
Yes, I know.

52:34.251 --> 52:36.209
And you discovered him?

52:36.834 --> 52:38.001
Yes.

52:41.417 --> 52:44.501
Would you have a coffee
with me sometime?

52:47.251 --> 52:48.334
I'm sorry.

52:48.917 --> 52:51.292
Whenever I see you, then...

52:51.667 --> 52:53.334
You know?
- No,

52:54.126 --> 52:56.126
but if you want a date...

52:57.042 --> 52:59.209
... no problem.
- Uh, yes.

53:00.709 --> 53:04.042
And you guys are, like,
friends of Franziska's?

53:04.792 --> 53:06.667
Apparently so.

53:07.334 --> 53:09.501
And are you, like, emos?

53:09.667 --> 53:13.667
Or goths,
or whatever they're called?

53:15.792 --> 53:17.501
No, we're Satanists.

53:21.209 --> 53:22.667
How nice.

53:28.042 --> 53:30.001
Grandma, this is Fabian.

53:30.251 --> 53:32.792
I won't sign a thing.
- You don't have to.

53:33.584 --> 53:35.209
Where are the teabags?

53:39.084 --> 53:41.209
It's so nice here.

53:41.626 --> 53:44.001
Yummy, this cake is great.

53:44.167 --> 53:47.709
Did you bake it?
- Why are you messing with her?

53:48.251 --> 53:50.959
Excuse me?
- She suffers from dementia,

53:51.626 --> 53:55.751
and you ask her if she baked
an almond-strawberry-cream cake?

53:56.334 --> 53:58.709
Are you a sadist?
- No.

54:00.626 --> 54:02.376
Good morning.
- Morning.

54:03.126 --> 54:04.667
Good morning.

54:05.626 --> 54:08.251
Well, this will be your new... Reich.

54:08.626 --> 54:09.959
Get...
- Morning.

54:10.417 --> 54:12.834
Hitler. Michael. Do you mind?
- Hi.

54:17.376 --> 54:19.334
It works.
- What's wrong?

54:19.501 --> 54:22.334
Laugh over there.
- Will I get my desk back?

54:22.751 --> 54:23.792
We'll see.

54:23.959 --> 54:27.751
Yes, then I'll pick you up later
for training.

54:28.334 --> 54:30.917
I don't need training.
- Call it tuning.

54:31.084 --> 54:33.001
Tuning for...
- No need.

54:33.417 --> 54:36.959
You need it for modern TV.
- No, I need a typewriter.

54:37.209 --> 54:39.917
Mrs. Krömeier?
She'll help you out.

54:40.084 --> 54:42.126
I'm a pro.
- Hey there, mister...

54:42.501 --> 54:44.917
It's not "mister,"
it's "my Führer."

54:45.126 --> 54:47.751
Oh yeah?
- I want a proper greeting.

54:47.917 --> 54:51.167
I knew it, I get to play a part!
- Uh...

54:51.584 --> 54:53.876
Morning, my Führer!
- Miss Krömeier?

54:54.042 --> 54:55.292
Lower your hand.

54:56.542 --> 55:00.626
It's supposed to be shouted, right?
Or shouted differently?

55:01.084 --> 55:03.876
Miss Krömeier, do me a favor?

55:04.376 --> 55:07.084
Stop shouting.
- Jawohl, my Führer.

55:07.251 --> 55:09.626
I agree.
Just play the secretary.

55:10.042 --> 55:12.751
Get him connected
with the big wide world.

55:13.292 --> 55:14.751
All right then...

55:15.584 --> 55:16.876
Let's get started.

55:17.042 --> 55:21.751
<i>Then she showed me
one of the most amazing inventions:</i>

55:21.917 --> 55:23.792
<i>The computer.</i>

55:23.959 --> 55:27.251
<i>Back in the day,
computers weren't really my thing.</i>

55:27.417 --> 55:30.584
<i>For the troops,
they seemed too bulky.</i>

55:31.501 --> 55:35.459
<i>But after that computers
became ever smaller and more practical.</i>

55:36.334 --> 55:40.876
<i>And then along came Douglas Engelbart
and invented this "mouse" device.</i>

55:41.417 --> 55:43.126
I'll take it now, okay?

55:43.542 --> 55:46.584
With this, you move the pointer
on the desktop.

55:46.751 --> 55:47.917
Here, try it.

55:51.959 --> 55:55.834
With the mouse.
- Double click on the left side.

55:56.292 --> 55:59.959
You're doing great, Mr. Hitler,
for your first time.

56:00.459 --> 56:02.917
What name should I use
for your email?

56:03.084 --> 56:05.084
My name. Adolf Hitler.

56:05.626 --> 56:08.376
Is that your real name?
- No, of course not!

56:08.542 --> 56:10.584
My real name is
Shmul Rosenzweig!

56:11.001 --> 56:13.251
Well, great. "Shmul" is cool.

56:13.667 --> 56:18.792
Shmul, is that with a "ch"?
- That was a joke, Miss Krömeier!

56:19.251 --> 56:20.709
Oh.

56:23.667 --> 56:27.751
"Adolf dot Hitler" is taken.
- What? Someone stole my name!

56:28.626 --> 56:30.917
How about
using a different name?

56:31.667 --> 56:34.459
You mean, like a pseudonym?
- Kind of.

56:34.626 --> 56:37.084
I see.
Fine, then use "Wulf..."

56:37.501 --> 56:40.959
"Wulf's"... "Wulf's Lair."

56:42.584 --> 56:46.584
"Wulf's Lair 6" is available.
- I am not Wulf's Lair 6!

56:47.042 --> 56:50.667
What was that thing called,
Ober... Obersalzbach?

56:52.126 --> 56:54.501
Obersalz <i>berg</i>,
Fräulein Krömeier.

56:54.876 --> 56:58.584
Use "New Reichs Chancellery."
I always liked it.

56:59.709 --> 57:03.667
<i>Mrs. Krömeier showed me even more.
A wonderful technology!</i>

57:03.834 --> 57:05.334
<i>The Internetwork.</i>

57:05.876 --> 57:08.542
Enter something
you're interested in.

57:11.209 --> 57:13.501
"World supremacy," and search.

57:13.667 --> 57:17.334
There's everything about
world supremacy. Great, huh?

57:27.251 --> 57:28.751
This Wikipedia...

57:29.209 --> 57:33.334
Even the name illustrates
the ingenuity of the Aryans.

57:34.292 --> 57:36.334
"Pedia" like "encyclopedia,"

57:36.501 --> 57:39.792
"wiki" like the explorer blood
of the Vikings.

57:42.292 --> 57:45.501
Are you crying, my Führer?
- No.

57:46.459 --> 57:48.376
I'm about to cry, too.

57:49.167 --> 57:52.876
<i>I know enough of those types
like Sensenbrink.</i>

57:53.626 --> 57:58.876
<i>Sensenbrink hopes he 's a success,
but' he 's only an accessory to success.</i>

57:59.834 --> 58:03.084
<i>Because he suspects this,
he fears the moment</i>

58:03.251 --> 58:06.459
<i>it is revealed
that the success is neither his,</i>

58:06.792 --> 58:08.917
<i>nor was he an accessory to it.</i>

58:09.084 --> 58:12.542
It's bound to fail:
Hitler on primetime.

58:14.126 --> 58:16.501
The Jewish Council will be all over us.

58:16.667 --> 58:18.667
Bellini is outdoing you.

58:18.834 --> 58:20.001
Just you wait.

58:21.417 --> 58:24.667
I'm putting Hitler
on the "Whoa, Dude!" show.

58:25.084 --> 58:29.292
The TV critics... I can only imagine
the shitstorm we'll see.

58:29.876 --> 58:31.751
This Hitler thing...

58:32.209 --> 58:36.292
... is going to break Katja Bellini's neck!

58:36.917 --> 58:38.042
Asylum seekers...

58:38.167 --> 58:40.042
<i>COMEDY AUTHORS
"WHOA, DUDE!" SHOW</i>

58:41.126 --> 58:43.626
... gypsies, minorities.
I like it.

58:44.042 --> 58:48.001
Jews, foreigners, homosexuals,
and concentration camps.

58:48.792 --> 58:52.876
Those are good topics.
Even I could come up with something.

58:53.376 --> 58:58.584
And now I'd like you to think up
fitting gags and one-liners.

58:59.042 --> 59:02.251
You mean positive,
with an ironic twist, or what?

59:02.834 --> 59:06.251
I don't quite understand.
- Funny one-liners.

59:06.709 --> 59:09.959
Racist jokes are racist.
You know that, right?

59:12.292 --> 59:13.876
I like it.

59:15.001 --> 59:16.334
You like racism?

59:16.501 --> 59:22.542
If anyone should own
the topic of racism, then it should be us.

59:23.334 --> 59:26.334
In order to be plausible,
he has to do it.

59:27.251 --> 59:28.959
Good. Now we're talking.

59:29.126 --> 59:31.834
I'm just saying, there are no taboos.

59:32.501 --> 59:35.792
There are no red lines,
and if you sense one,

59:36.209 --> 59:39.459
you are cordially invited to cross it.

59:40.542 --> 59:42.667
"Salafists and Jews
are similar:

59:42.834 --> 59:46.251
circumcised,
hook-nosed and highly flammable."

59:47.459 --> 59:51.709
"Jews rated their trip to Auschwitz:
They all gave it one star."

59:56.709 --> 01:00:00.626
"What does a Jewish pedophile say?
Want to buy a candy?"

01:00:02.251 --> 01:00:04.459
Please excuse my chuckling.

01:00:05.126 --> 01:00:09.542
"A Salafist comes home to
his screaming child: 'What a terror'."

01:00:10.584 --> 01:00:15.459
"My driving teacher asked me where
the gas is: 'Second door on the right'."

01:00:15.792 --> 01:00:17.792
Jesus.

01:00:18.376 --> 01:00:22.167
"Idioms change over time.
'Ashes to ashes' used to mean

01:00:22.334 --> 01:00:24.834
you went to Auschwitz on vacation."

01:00:25.334 --> 01:00:27.292
Is this what you want?

01:00:27.459 --> 01:00:28.584
Yes.

01:00:29.042 --> 01:00:30.167
Precisely.

01:00:32.626 --> 01:00:33.876
Hi.
- Hi.

01:00:35.126 --> 01:00:37.292
I just wanted to say hello.

01:00:39.126 --> 01:00:40.501
Pleased to meet you.

01:00:40.876 --> 01:00:42.334
Same here.

01:00:43.334 --> 01:00:45.542
That... looks great.

01:00:48.959 --> 01:00:51.292
Christoph, do you have a moment?

01:00:51.792 --> 01:00:53.501
What is it?

01:00:53.917 --> 01:00:56.459
Well, this is a great idea.
- Yes?

01:00:56.626 --> 01:00:58.042
Hitler on the show.

01:00:59.042 --> 01:01:01.251
Nobody asks me anymore?

01:01:01.417 --> 01:01:05.376
It seems I no longer understand
the concept of my own show.

01:01:05.751 --> 01:01:08.334
It's... funny.
- Oh yeah?

01:01:09.001 --> 01:01:12.084
With Hitler, it's always a fine line.
- I know.

01:01:12.542 --> 01:01:14.751
Your show plays with fine lines.

01:01:15.126 --> 01:01:18.834
This will be a one-time deal.
Do I have your word?

01:01:19.001 --> 01:01:20.542
Two. You have two words.

01:01:21.209 --> 01:01:22.334
Oh, please!

01:01:23.209 --> 01:01:24.667
Michi...
- Michi...

01:01:28.042 --> 01:01:31.542
Jeanette, can you get us a drink?
- My name's Janine.

01:01:32.459 --> 01:01:33.751
The...

01:01:34.167 --> 01:01:35.917
... show is live.

01:01:37.667 --> 01:01:40.167
But no need to worry...

01:01:42.917 --> 01:01:45.876
Just be... yourself.

01:01:56.251 --> 01:02:00.917
<i>The show "Whoa Dude!"
confirms everything I had heard.</i>

01:02:01.667 --> 01:02:05.542
<i>Witzigmann appears
in various costumes:</i>

01:02:06.001 --> 01:02:08.251
<i>black U.S. president,
Muslim woman</i>

01:02:08.667 --> 01:02:13.209
<i>or other minority,
to make mincemeat of current politics.</i>

01:02:13.667 --> 01:02:16.251
I'm on an erotic diet.

01:02:16.667 --> 01:02:21.959
A fruit course for breakfast, lunch
and dinner, intercourse for dessert...

01:02:24.959 --> 01:02:27.626
<i>The transition was to happen
with a line</i>

01:02:27.959 --> 01:02:30.626
<i>Witzigmann delivered
without a flinch:</i>

01:02:31.042 --> 01:02:34.667
Ladies and gentlemen,
he's been lost for decades,

01:02:35.084 --> 01:02:37.667
now he's back!
Give a warm welcome to...

01:02:37.834 --> 01:02:40.126
... Adolf Hitler!

01:02:41.376 --> 01:02:43.292
All or nothing, here we go.

01:02:58.251 --> 01:03:01.459
Welcome, dear Adolf, to...

01:03:01.626 --> 01:03:04.001
... to "Whoa..."
- "Dude!"

01:03:04.167 --> 01:03:05.709
Greetings!

01:03:09.126 --> 01:03:12.709
All right.
Then I'd say: Bombs away!

01:03:13.709 --> 01:03:17.709
<i>When they see me,
the audience becomes uneasy.</i>

01:03:20.626 --> 01:03:25.667
<i>They try to match my face
to that of the Hitler actors they know.</i>

01:03:27.834 --> 01:03:29.459
<i>I see their unease,</i>

01:03:30.417 --> 01:03:34.751
<i>which my mere gaze
transforms into breathless silence.</i>

01:03:45.376 --> 01:03:47.334
Is this part of the act?

01:03:48.001 --> 01:03:49.584
Not this long.

01:03:50.001 --> 01:03:51.292
Is it a blackout?

01:03:52.001 --> 01:03:56.292
<i>An assistant gives me a sign,
as if I'd forgotten my lines.</i>

01:03:58.167 --> 01:04:02.042
<i>It was clear that in the face of
this seeming inaction,</i>

01:04:02.792 --> 01:04:06.167
<i>that amateur Witzigmann
started to sweat.</i>

01:04:08.376 --> 01:04:10.709
<i>What is this?
What's going on?</i>

01:04:12.209 --> 01:04:15.084
<i>Will he do anything?</i>
- He has to, we're live.

01:04:16.667 --> 01:04:19.792
Michael, you take over.
- No, we wait.

01:04:20.251 --> 01:04:21.667
<i>Give him time.</i>

01:04:21.834 --> 01:04:25.959
<i>Witzigmann doesn't understand
the power of silence, he feared it.</i>

01:04:26.459 --> 01:04:29.667
<i>I let the air flow into my lungs...</i>

01:04:29.834 --> 01:04:33.751
<i>... and give the silence... a sound.</i>

01:04:35.834 --> 01:04:38.917
Over there... is someone...

01:04:39.584 --> 01:04:41.334
... is holding some signs.

01:04:42.126 --> 01:04:44.167
With text for me to read out.

01:04:44.334 --> 01:04:47.376
The text... is a joke.

01:04:48.084 --> 01:04:49.959
A joke about immigrants.

01:04:50.709 --> 01:04:53.501
<i>But why make jokes about immigrants?</i>

01:04:54.251 --> 01:04:56.834
<i>If you have rats in your house,
you don't get a clown,</i>

01:04:57.001 --> 01:04:59.334
<i>you call pest control.</i>

01:05:00.709 --> 01:05:02.626
The television in my hotel...

01:05:04.084 --> 01:05:05.209
... is this thin.

01:05:06.709 --> 01:05:10.667
A marvel of human ingenuity.

01:05:11.084 --> 01:05:13.584
But what is shown
on that television?

01:05:13.876 --> 01:05:16.876
Just trash.
When times are bad...

01:05:17.501 --> 01:05:21.917
... people need light entertainment.
That's why, in 1944,

01:05:22.376 --> 01:05:25.167
we broadcast light comedies.

01:05:26.334 --> 01:05:28.626
<i>But how bad can times get...</i>

01:05:29.084 --> 01:05:33.042
<i>... for the people to be bombarded
with such idiotic nonsense!</i>

01:05:33.792 --> 01:05:34.834
He's so right.

01:05:35.001 --> 01:05:36.917
<i>What kind of country is this?</i>

01:05:37.084 --> 01:05:38.751
<i>Child poverty...</i>

01:05:39.459 --> 01:05:42.251
<i>... old-age poverty,
unemployment...</i>

01:05:42.417 --> 01:05:45.126
<i>... birthrate lower than ever.
No wonder!</i>

01:05:45.292 --> 01:05:48.501
<i>Who wants to have a child
in this country?</i>

01:05:49.834 --> 01:05:50.917
We are racing...

01:05:52.251 --> 01:05:54.501
... toward the abyss.

01:05:55.167 --> 01:05:57.292
But we don't see it,

01:05:58.001 --> 01:05:59.376
because on TV...

01:06:00.167 --> 01:06:02.584
... you cannot see the abyss.

01:06:04.876 --> 01:06:06.209
You see...

01:06:06.501 --> 01:06:07.792
... a cooking show.

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:13.667
I will keep fighting
against TV

01:06:14.292 --> 01:06:16.917
until we not only see the abyss,

01:06:17.084 --> 01:06:19.542
but until we overcome it!

01:06:19.959 --> 01:06:23.501
It is 8:45 PM,
broadcasting is returning fire.

01:06:37.667 --> 01:06:38.959
Yes!

01:06:40.417 --> 01:06:41.917
Yes, yes, yes!

01:06:49.834 --> 01:06:52.334
It's getting pretty late.
- Yes.

01:06:53.834 --> 01:06:56.709
Oh God,
I forgot to call home.

01:06:57.667 --> 01:06:59.417
Are you married?

01:06:59.584 --> 01:07:01.792
No, I'm not married...

01:07:02.417 --> 01:07:05.167
No, I live with my mo...

01:07:05.584 --> 01:07:07.251
My moth...

01:07:07.417 --> 01:07:10.084
Come again?
- My other flatmate.

01:07:12.251 --> 01:07:14.334
To be honest, with my mother.

01:07:14.751 --> 01:07:16.876
Want to sleep here?

01:07:18.042 --> 01:07:19.417
Yes.

01:07:20.834 --> 01:07:23.876
On the couch.
- Uh, yes.

01:07:24.584 --> 01:07:27.917
But no touching.
- No, I'd never touch you.

01:07:29.251 --> 01:07:30.417
Who said never?

01:07:41.751 --> 01:07:44.459
Hey, not so loud!
You'll wake my Grandma.

01:07:53.167 --> 01:07:56.501
Margot wants one too...
- Get that asshole off my show!

01:07:56.667 --> 01:07:58.876
Did you fall asleep in the control room?
- Enough.

01:07:59.501 --> 01:08:02.292
I'll never forgive you.
- Michael... - Shut up.

01:08:03.001 --> 01:08:04.917
All right, my friend...

01:08:05.667 --> 01:08:07.626
Yes, that's enough now.

01:08:07.792 --> 01:08:10.709
Thank you.
Oh, just shut up, Katja, okay?

01:08:11.126 --> 01:08:13.792
Hey, leave Hitler alone!
- No, this is...

01:08:14.167 --> 01:08:16.292
Stop it!
- Leave the Führer alone!

01:08:16.667 --> 01:08:19.834
We've seen this act
a hundred times!

01:08:20.209 --> 01:08:22.834
Asshole!
You're a real cunt! Let me go!

01:08:23.709 --> 01:08:24.876
This is my show!

01:08:25.042 --> 01:08:27.251
Put the Führer
on all the shows!

01:08:27.417 --> 01:08:30.459
Breakfast Show,
Celebrity Dinner, whatever.

01:08:30.626 --> 01:08:32.167
This is a hit!
- Okay.

01:08:32.334 --> 01:08:34.876
This will be great.

01:08:35.292 --> 01:08:38.251
Thanks, everybody. Get home safely.
- Shit.

01:08:38.709 --> 01:08:40.542
And now our next guest!

01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:44.417
Would it be wrong to say
he's taken Germany by storm?

01:08:44.876 --> 01:08:47.751
Give a warm welcome to...
Adolf Hitler!

01:08:48.376 --> 01:08:51.001
You wanted to be a painter.
It didn't work.

01:08:51.167 --> 01:08:54.751
Was it the lack of talent, or what?
- No...

01:08:55.292 --> 01:08:59.501
It was providence that wanted
a person like me to be a politician.

01:08:59.917 --> 01:09:03.917
Like with a provocative rapper:
You stand on a crate yelling,

01:09:04.334 --> 01:09:08.167
and people look, then what?
- It's not about provocation.

01:09:08.501 --> 01:09:10.709
It's about the German people.

01:09:11.126 --> 01:09:15.042
A leader is nothing without his people.
It's like Mozart

01:09:15.209 --> 01:09:16.917
without a piano.

01:09:17.084 --> 01:09:21.584
He could play violin with his sister,
but if we take that away too?

01:09:21.917 --> 01:09:24.542
What's your piano?
- The people.

01:09:25.126 --> 01:09:27.126
I play piano on the people.

01:09:27.501 --> 01:09:30.584
The black keys as well?
- The black keys as well.

01:09:30.792 --> 01:09:32.834
When they have to be pressed.

01:09:33.209 --> 01:09:35.834
What are your plans for the future?

01:09:36.167 --> 01:09:41.334
To make Germany great again,
and secure the survival of the Germans.

01:09:42.001 --> 01:09:43.584
Maybe I should just leave?

01:09:44.001 --> 01:09:46.459
Even for you, we have tasks.
- I bet.

01:09:46.917 --> 01:09:49.084
With the Autobahn, for example.

01:09:49.251 --> 01:09:51.709
They need people
for the toll booths.

01:09:52.042 --> 01:09:54.209
Or in construction.
- Yes.

01:09:54.626 --> 01:09:58.084
You have to stay Hitler?
- Yes, so I can get things done.

01:09:58.917 --> 01:10:02.126
So you don't have any
Hitler-free moments?

01:10:02.584 --> 01:10:05.251
No, no, I do not.

01:10:05.751 --> 01:10:08.542
Just like you have no
Thadeusz-free moments.

01:10:08.917 --> 01:10:10.584
It was your destiny.

01:10:11.001 --> 01:10:15.042
And what is your destiny?
- You are a little screw...

01:10:16.501 --> 01:10:18.834
... in the grand machine of time.

01:10:19.292 --> 01:10:21.667
And you?
- I'm the steering wheel,

01:10:22.001 --> 01:10:23.959
and you're the little screw.

01:10:35.584 --> 01:10:39.209
Germans swinging from one
Jungle Camp to the next.

01:10:39.542 --> 01:10:42.501
It's worse than the two World Wars
I experienced.

01:10:44.042 --> 01:10:45.251
We are racing...

01:10:46.417 --> 01:10:49.042
<i>Toward the abyss</i>

01:10:49.209 --> 01:10:50.834
<i>But we don't see it</i>

01:10:51.459 --> 01:10:53.834
<i>Because on television</i>

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:56.417
<i>You cannot see the abyss</i>

01:10:57.834 --> 01:10:58.792
<i>The abyss!</i>

01:10:59.167 --> 01:11:03.959
<i>World War 2 wasn't that great, but now
there's a new comedian on the march.</i>

01:11:04.376 --> 01:11:06.209
<i>And he imitated Hitler!</i>

01:11:06.376 --> 01:11:08.751
<i>What's wrong with this guy?</i>

01:11:08.917 --> 01:11:11.334
<i>At any rate, quite the rebel!</i>

01:11:11.709 --> 01:11:16.167
<i>And on television, he goes and says:
"Television is trash."</i>

01:11:16.334 --> 01:11:18.626
<i>And I'm like:
Hold on, I have to see this!</i>

01:11:18.792 --> 01:11:22.501
<i>Should you take it seriously
or should you laugh at it?</i>

01:11:22.667 --> 01:11:26.584
<i>What he's talking about
is serious, and he's kind of right.</i>

01:11:26.751 --> 01:11:31.292
<i>The big question is:
Is Germany ready for this kind of humor?</i>

01:11:31.459 --> 01:11:34.417
<i>... in the midst of a refugee debate,
I say: No!</i>

01:11:34.584 --> 01:11:37.959
<i>No, Witzigmann,
it's not all about the ratings.</i>

01:11:38.126 --> 01:11:40.376
<i>... it shouldn't be underestimated.</i>

01:11:40.542 --> 01:11:46.084
<i>Back then there was a lot of talk too,
and it was put into practice.</i>

01:11:46.251 --> 01:11:49.501
<i>I'm not sure
if this is a good or a bad thing.</i>

01:11:54.667 --> 01:11:57.709
<i>And you have that perfect
Fashion Führer look!</i>

01:11:57.876 --> 01:12:01.667
<i>The sad thing is, what he's saying
isn't all that wrong.</i>

01:12:01.834 --> 01:12:05.584
<i>Child poverty, old-age poverty,
unemployment...</i>

01:12:06.626 --> 01:12:11.501
<i>Chancellor or YouTube star?
He seems to have what it takes for both.</i>

01:12:11.667 --> 01:12:15.584
<i>Have a child in this country...
What kind of country is this...</i>

01:12:15.917 --> 01:12:18.709
<i>Do I really want to have kids
in this world?</i>

01:12:18.876 --> 01:12:22.542
<i>I thought he was great,
and I'm going to stay tuned.</i>

01:12:22.959 --> 01:12:27.042
<i>Child poverty, old-age poverty,
unemployment...</i>

01:12:28.042 --> 01:12:30.501
<i>Yesterday on "Whoa, Dude!"...
-  I hate you,</i>

01:12:30.667 --> 01:12:33.501
<i>I hate everybody.
Except for Hitler.</i>

01:12:34.292 --> 01:12:36.792
<i>With his little moustache...</i>

01:12:47.084 --> 01:12:52.417
"Brown Gold, the Bittersweet
Attraction of Adolf H."

01:12:53.542 --> 01:12:57.001
"The Führer, of all people,
hits the nail on the head."

01:12:57.417 --> 01:12:59.042
Nothing but positive.

01:12:59.626 --> 01:13:03.792
Sheer enthusiasm.
Everywhere, really. Sheer enthusiasm.

01:13:06.251 --> 01:13:07.917
Oh, here's a bad one.

01:13:10.834 --> 01:13:15.876
"Stop this bulshit,
you fuckin Juwish pig."

01:13:24.001 --> 01:13:26.709
Haven't had such a good laugh
in a while.

01:13:27.376 --> 01:13:29.334
<i>It was pretty sad</i>

01:13:29.501 --> 01:13:32.334
<i>that it took months
before I even realized</i>

01:13:32.501 --> 01:13:37.167
<i>there were people who felt the calling
to continue the work of the NSDAP.</i>

01:13:44.376 --> 01:13:48.042
The National Democratic Party,
if you look closely behind the facade,

01:13:48.209 --> 01:13:51.501
is only against the death penalty,
I mean for it,

01:13:51.834 --> 01:13:55.584
for pedophiles and the like.
They're for justice.

01:13:57.042 --> 01:14:00.417
If you will.
We're just fighting for our rights.

01:14:00.834 --> 01:14:03.167
We could use more democracy

01:14:03.334 --> 01:14:06.209
so that someone
can lay down the law,

01:14:06.584 --> 01:14:10.751
and say: This is how we're doing it.
That's it, no discussion.

01:14:11.126 --> 01:14:14.667
You are so right.
That's just my kind of democracy.

01:14:14.917 --> 01:14:16.834
That's how I see democracy.

01:14:17.209 --> 01:14:21.584
How do you see Germany?
What would you change in general?

01:14:22.376 --> 01:14:24.542
HEAD OF AFD BAVARIA

01:14:24.667 --> 01:14:27.501
So, a big topic for us
is federal finance reform.

01:14:28.001 --> 01:14:32.001
And then another overall topic
is educational policy,

01:14:32.167 --> 01:14:36.584
we want the government
to take more responsibility...

01:14:37.626 --> 01:14:41.001
And finally, there's also...

01:14:44.292 --> 01:14:46.792
Okay, he doesn't seem to agree.

01:14:50.334 --> 01:14:54.792
This steamroller tactic by the media,
putting us in the right-wing corner...

01:14:55.084 --> 01:14:57.126
Of course, that's no good.

01:14:57.959 --> 01:15:00.167
You cook for National Socialism?

01:15:00.334 --> 01:15:02.334
VEGAN NEO-NAZI
INTERNET COOKING SHOW

01:15:02.667 --> 01:15:06.042
Only for Germany.
- We're Germans first, then Socialists.

01:15:13.501 --> 01:15:18.542
Destiny gave us this great technology
to use for propaganda, and you,

01:15:19.042 --> 01:15:23.376
you use it to prepare a silly stew!
How utterly idiotic!

01:15:23.917 --> 01:15:29.042
They want to be heirs
to National Socialism? They are nothing!

01:15:29.417 --> 01:15:34.417
Build the Fourth Reich?
They can't even build an Ikea shelf.

01:15:35.126 --> 01:15:38.167
The political situation
DEP. CHAIRMAN NPD

01:15:38.334 --> 01:15:41.792
is good, as underhanded as it sounds.

01:15:42.251 --> 01:15:45.501
Of course we're not happy to see

01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:50.209
between 200 and 400 asylum seekers
showing up in Munich each week.

01:15:50.959 --> 01:15:53.501
I agree. The worse the situation is,

01:15:53.667 --> 01:15:57.584
the better it is for people like us.
- It's good, politically.

01:15:57.959 --> 01:15:59.251
You see.

01:16:00.292 --> 01:16:02.292
I need men like you.

01:16:02.459 --> 01:16:06.292
I'd like to send you
into the next war. Right to the front.

01:16:08.834 --> 01:16:11.542
Would you do whatever I order?

01:16:13.084 --> 01:16:14.959
Turn that thing off.

01:16:18.876 --> 01:16:21.251
If you were really him,
I probably would.

01:16:22.751 --> 01:16:24.792
SOMEWHERE IN BRANDENBURG

01:16:25.209 --> 01:16:27.709
Thinking of Germany at night

01:16:29.417 --> 01:16:31.959
Puts all thought of sleep to flight

01:16:32.292 --> 01:16:34.167
Ain't that the truth.

01:16:34.334 --> 01:16:37.876
That man brought me to tears
with his poem.

01:16:38.417 --> 01:16:41.292
How many people can you round up?
- Over 500.

01:16:41.459 --> 01:16:43.501
Over 500? 2000?

01:16:44.584 --> 01:16:48.209
And they'll beat our ideas
into the heads of the intellectuals.

01:16:48.376 --> 01:16:49.501
Not a problem.

01:16:49.876 --> 01:16:52.626
But they'll only follow
if there really is a just cause.

01:16:52.792 --> 01:16:55.709
That's right.
It's always about content.

01:16:56.167 --> 01:17:01.084
Most people would even die for it.
- Sure, I'd die for my country too.

01:17:01.251 --> 01:17:02.876
Me too.
- You see?

01:17:03.251 --> 01:17:06.001
That's what I need.
- I'm already there.

01:17:06.167 --> 01:17:08.209
Men like you.
- In a heartbeat.

01:17:08.584 --> 01:17:10.876
Be strong.
- Exactly.

01:17:11.709 --> 01:17:13.667
Schnappi, be strong!

01:17:14.126 --> 01:17:17.292
Yes, Schnappi, be strong.
Hard as Krupp's steel,

01:17:17.542 --> 01:17:20.626
swift as a greyhound,
tough as leather!

01:17:20.792 --> 01:17:23.584
For Germany.
- For Germany. For the cause.

01:17:24.709 --> 01:17:27.417
All right, then...
So long, niggas!

01:17:27.709 --> 01:17:30.084
Niggers?
- You niggas!

01:17:30.251 --> 01:17:33.959
That's what you say nowadays.
- There are no niggers here.

01:17:34.292 --> 01:17:35.667
HEADQUARTERS NPD

01:17:35.834 --> 01:17:40.834
<i>Admittedly, the Brown House in Munich
was not earth-shattering at the time.</i>

01:17:41.001 --> 01:17:44.459
<i>But this shack in Köpenick, Berlin,
how pitiful.</i>

01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:48.376
<i>The building alone
looked like a hopeless case.</i>

01:17:53.667 --> 01:17:56.667
What is this?
- It's our doorbell nameplate.

01:17:57.709 --> 01:18:02.209
Such a small nameplate is cowardice
before the enemy. Out of my way!

01:18:05.084 --> 01:18:07.209
Stop, this is our office. Hello!

01:18:08.584 --> 01:18:10.667
Can you please...

01:18:11.667 --> 01:18:13.084
Oh, man.

01:18:19.376 --> 01:18:21.501
Do you have a filming permit?

01:18:21.667 --> 01:18:24.959
Since when does a national movement
hide behind bureaucracy?

01:18:25.126 --> 01:18:27.584
I want to speak to your Reichsleiter.

01:18:27.751 --> 01:18:30.584
You mean the chairman?

01:18:31.959 --> 01:18:35.001
Who should I say is here?
- The name is Hitler.

01:18:36.501 --> 01:18:37.792
Okay.

01:18:50.417 --> 01:18:52.834
You see "hit the gas" in quotation marks.

01:18:53.459 --> 01:18:56.459
As if you shouldn't actually
hit the gas.

01:18:57.709 --> 01:19:01.334
Is this for Channel 7 or something?
- This is for Germany!

01:19:01.709 --> 01:19:03.376
Okay, I got it.

01:19:10.792 --> 01:19:11.876
Well, how nice.

01:19:12.834 --> 01:19:14.251
It's Mr. Hitler.

01:19:15.001 --> 01:19:19.334
Ulf Birne, Federal Chairman
of the National Democratic Party.

01:19:19.667 --> 01:19:21.959
Please. We have to talk.

01:19:23.292 --> 01:19:24.626
It's my pleasure.

01:19:29.251 --> 01:19:32.667
So you represent the national cause?
- Well...

01:19:33.251 --> 01:19:35.751
You haven't been around for a while.

01:19:35.917 --> 01:19:38.209
I have to manage my time.

01:19:39.292 --> 01:19:43.001
The question is, what have you
achieved up till now?

01:19:43.542 --> 01:19:47.459
Our comrades...
- You share the trenches with comrades.

01:19:47.792 --> 01:19:51.751
Except for me, however,
that applies to nobody here.

01:19:51.917 --> 01:19:53.001
Okay.

01:19:53.167 --> 01:19:56.084
We National Democrats...
- National Democrats.

01:19:56.251 --> 01:19:59.376
National Democracy!
What's that supposed to be?

01:19:59.542 --> 01:20:03.251
National Socialism
requires a conception of democracy

01:20:03.417 --> 01:20:07.459
that is not suited for a name!
How stupid can you be?

01:20:07.626 --> 01:20:11.876
Have you read my book?
- It's hard to get in Germany.

01:20:12.042 --> 01:20:14.959
Is that your excuse for having read it?

01:20:15.376 --> 01:20:17.001
Or for having <i>not</i> read it?

01:20:17.417 --> 01:20:20.084
Or for not having quite understood it?

01:20:23.042 --> 01:20:24.709
Well, this is...

01:20:25.542 --> 01:20:27.584
Can we turn off the camera?
- No!

01:20:28.042 --> 01:20:30.292
You have wasted enough time.

01:20:30.667 --> 01:20:34.751
Each of your words
throws the movement back by decades.

01:20:35.251 --> 01:20:36.459
What about race?

01:20:36.792 --> 01:20:40.126
Germany for the Germans?
- Who else would it be for?

01:20:40.292 --> 01:20:42.209
For the Poles?

01:20:42.626 --> 01:20:44.751
Is this your best available man?

01:20:46.792 --> 01:20:49.126
Then good luck, gentlemen.

01:20:52.501 --> 01:20:55.792
I'd like to see Mrs. Bellini.
Where is her office?

01:20:56.126 --> 01:20:59.001
It's over there, but I can't...
- Thanks.

01:20:59.376 --> 01:21:02.042
We'll find it.
- You can't just...

01:21:02.209 --> 01:21:05.542
Thank you.
Hello, Mrs. Bellini.

01:21:05.709 --> 01:21:08.917
The cops and the D.A. are here!
- Quicker than expected.

01:21:09.292 --> 01:21:11.001
Oh. What can I do for you?

01:21:11.167 --> 01:21:12.834
Hello.
- The DA is here.

01:21:13.001 --> 01:21:15.584
Göttlicher, District Attorney...
- Katja Bellini.

01:21:16.292 --> 01:21:18.876
A complaint has been filed

01:21:19.042 --> 01:21:21.126
charging violation of hate laws.

01:21:21.501 --> 01:21:22.917
What?

01:21:23.542 --> 01:21:26.126
Who filed the complaint?

01:21:26.376 --> 01:21:27.417
Anonymous.

01:21:27.792 --> 01:21:29.542
Ah, what a yellow-bellied snitch.

01:21:30.584 --> 01:21:33.584
Okay, what exactly
does this mean for us?

01:21:33.876 --> 01:21:37.001
Looks like we have to cancel
the "Führer" show.

01:21:37.459 --> 01:21:40.459
Oh, you can keep broadcasting.

01:21:43.959 --> 01:21:46.834
Personally, I think
the show is brilliant.

01:21:47.209 --> 01:21:48.251
The way he...

01:21:48.417 --> 01:21:51.584
I'm happy to hear it.
- And that stringency.

01:21:52.042 --> 01:21:55.709
I'm sure the complaint was filed by some
left-wing liberals. You know the type.

01:21:56.084 --> 01:21:58.126
I'm sure the investigation
will come to nothing.

01:21:58.501 --> 01:22:01.001
This will take care of itself.

01:22:01.709 --> 01:22:02.876
Good bye.

01:22:10.709 --> 01:22:13.584
Mr. Sensenbrink, what about the dog?
- Dog?

01:22:14.001 --> 01:22:16.709
I have to pay the invoice
for the dead dog.

01:22:16.917 --> 01:22:17.959
What dog?

01:22:18.126 --> 01:22:22.167
The dog that died while Mr. Hitler
and Sawatzki were filming.

01:22:23.542 --> 01:22:26.459
Do I file it under write-offs?

01:22:27.584 --> 01:22:29.709
Or under losses?

01:22:30.626 --> 01:22:31.667
I'll handle it.

01:22:33.417 --> 01:22:34.459
That's nice.

01:22:35.292 --> 01:22:36.751
Heil Hitler.

01:22:37.834 --> 01:22:40.542
What's wrong?
- You're asking me what's wrong?

01:22:41.042 --> 01:22:44.709
A huge pile of Hitler-Nazi-shit,
that's what.

01:22:44.959 --> 01:22:47.251
And everyone shouts, "Hurrah!"

01:22:47.959 --> 01:22:51.459
That's what.
This is the most fucked-up, evil,

01:22:51.876 --> 01:22:53.834
inhuman...
- You're drunk.

01:22:54.459 --> 01:22:55.542
And you're sober.

01:22:55.709 --> 01:22:59.209
You're doing all this bullshit
with a clear head.

01:22:59.542 --> 01:23:02.417
You know how many people
are cheering him on?

01:23:03.001 --> 01:23:06.667
Not because they think
he's funny, or ironic.

01:23:06.834 --> 01:23:10.251
They think what he says is cool!
They think he's right.

01:23:10.626 --> 01:23:14.709
And now I ask you, Mrs. Katja Bellini:
Are you okay with that?

01:23:15.084 --> 01:23:20.001
Or don't you give a shit?
- What about all the positive reviews?

01:23:20.501 --> 01:23:23.709
Those journalists are complete morons.

01:23:24.084 --> 01:23:27.376
They're afraid
of missing the dramatic ambiguity.

01:23:27.751 --> 01:23:32.292
But there is no ambiguity with
Mr. Hitler. He's just an asshole!

01:23:32.667 --> 01:23:35.042
This is a big, brown
pile of Nazi bullshit.

01:23:35.209 --> 01:23:38.209
And you're sitting right on top of it,

01:23:38.376 --> 01:23:41.417
because you're the boss of it all.
- That's enough.

01:23:41.584 --> 01:23:44.209
You're not a coward.
You're not

01:23:44.417 --> 01:23:48.167
stupid, like so many.
You're obsessed with your career.

01:23:51.001 --> 01:23:53.209
Careful.
- That hurt. Okay.

01:23:54.542 --> 01:23:56.334
Good night, Mrs. Goebbels.

01:24:05.417 --> 01:24:09.501
I have a confession to make.
We had your background checked.

01:24:10.001 --> 01:24:12.709
Then the results
must have reassured you.

01:24:13.667 --> 01:24:17.167
On the one hand, yes.
We found nothing incriminating.

01:24:17.334 --> 01:24:21.584
And on the other hand?
- We found <i>nothing</i> at all about you.

01:24:21.751 --> 01:24:24.542
As if you never existed.

01:24:25.542 --> 01:24:28.459
Would you like to know
if I ever existed?

01:24:30.167 --> 01:24:32.626
Please understand,

01:24:32.792 --> 01:24:37.667
we need to make sure we're not
dealing with the real Hitler...

01:24:38.667 --> 01:24:40.209
What am I saying?

01:24:40.626 --> 01:24:44.001
Indeed. That's high treason.

01:24:44.167 --> 01:24:47.709
So you've never been
in a right-wing party?

01:24:48.084 --> 01:24:50.751
On the contrary:
I was a founding member.

01:24:51.126 --> 01:24:53.251
Membership number 555.

01:24:53.876 --> 01:24:55.251
What?

01:24:56.501 --> 01:25:00.292
A youthful folly, I hope.
- Nonsense. In 1919,

01:25:00.667 --> 01:25:04.126
I was 30 years old.
That's no youthful folly.

01:25:04.501 --> 01:25:05.834
1919?
- When else?

01:25:06.334 --> 01:25:08.584
I even thought up that fraud!

01:25:08.959 --> 01:25:13.417
We started at 500 so it sounded like
we had more members.

01:25:22.417 --> 01:25:25.626
Thank you
for the warm welcome.

01:25:26.042 --> 01:25:29.209
Nice of you to join us,
and nice of <i>you</i> to join us.

01:25:29.626 --> 01:25:32.042
<i>How shall I address you tonight?</i>

01:25:33.084 --> 01:25:35.251
<i>"Mr. Hitler" would suffice.</i>

01:25:35.542 --> 01:25:39.709
<i>You can also say "My Führer."
- You're a comedian, aren't you?</i>

01:25:40.876 --> 01:25:42.876
Some people see me that way.

01:25:43.251 --> 01:25:47.167
Are you comfortable in that role?
- I feel comfortable in every role.

01:25:47.834 --> 01:25:52.501
I want to reach people, and you can't
reach someone who isn't listening.

01:25:52.959 --> 01:25:55.376
So I'm willing to play the fool.

01:25:55.792 --> 01:25:58.084
What kind of person are you?

01:25:58.251 --> 01:26:01.626
Many newspapers
write that you're crazy.

01:26:02.167 --> 01:26:04.751
<i>What do you say to that?
- Do I look crazy?</i>

01:26:05.501 --> 01:26:09.209
Pardon me for saying so but,
a little. Your eyes scare me.

01:26:09.751 --> 01:26:13.792
Here I stand, I cannot do other.
I am who I am.

01:26:14.417 --> 01:26:17.876
Is that funny?
- As funny as the times we're living in.

01:26:18.042 --> 01:26:22.042
I have my doubts whether
what you're doing is justified.

01:26:22.209 --> 01:26:24.167
Look what we've found:

01:26:24.626 --> 01:26:27.376
Among the clips you filmed
was this one...

01:26:27.542 --> 01:26:29.834
What clip?
- Have a look.

01:26:30.751 --> 01:26:33.459
<i>I can only sell dogs
to people I trust.</i>

01:26:33.834 --> 01:26:36.626
You can't do that.
You don't... That...

01:26:37.042 --> 01:26:38.542
What is this?

01:26:40.001 --> 01:26:41.042
It's...

01:26:42.042 --> 01:26:44.501
<i>Damned mutt!
- My dog!</i>

01:26:45.459 --> 01:26:46.667
<i>You shot my dog!</i>

01:26:47.042 --> 01:26:48.959
Do you find that funny?

01:26:49.126 --> 01:26:52.084
Are we supposed to laugh?
- It was an accident.

01:26:52.459 --> 01:26:55.001
What?
- It wasn't really that bad.

01:26:55.959 --> 01:26:58.084
Okay, it <i>was</i>.
How did he get that?

01:26:58.417 --> 01:27:01.001
You should know.
- Is that your humor?

01:27:01.167 --> 01:27:03.917
Could you tell me
why you did that clip?

01:27:04.084 --> 01:27:06.834
That clip...
I had to shoot that dog,

01:27:07.292 --> 01:27:10.709
because the dog had it coming,
don't you see?

01:27:11.126 --> 01:27:13.626
That dog bit me in the finger!

01:27:13.792 --> 01:27:17.001
And I did exactly
what I would do to you.

01:27:17.417 --> 01:27:20.292
I'll turn your studio
into a parking lot for tanks!

01:27:21.126 --> 01:27:24.251
I will certainly not
be fired because of a dog.

01:27:29.792 --> 01:27:31.834
"TV HITLER
FINALLY GETS CANNED!"

01:27:32.167 --> 01:27:34.792
It hurts me deep down.
You tried so hard.

01:27:34.959 --> 01:27:38.667
Spare me your false pity.
- I think he means it.

01:27:39.042 --> 01:27:40.959
Anything is possible in TV.

01:27:41.292 --> 01:27:45.834
The viewer will forgive nearly anything.
But killing a little dog...

01:27:47.209 --> 01:27:49.292
The German soul will not forgive it.

01:27:49.459 --> 01:27:53.209
My wife and I became ill
after watching this.

01:27:54.292 --> 01:27:56.084
I wish you all the best.

01:27:59.542 --> 01:28:01.459
Now you're at the helm.

01:28:04.667 --> 01:28:06.084
Don't disappoint me.

01:28:09.709 --> 01:28:11.209
Certainly not.

01:28:13.126 --> 01:28:14.459
Hi, Mom.

01:28:15.667 --> 01:28:17.459
We lost our hotel room.

01:28:17.626 --> 01:28:19.917
Can we sleep here a while?
- Sure.

01:28:24.792 --> 01:28:26.917
Thank you, madam,

01:28:27.084 --> 01:28:29.792
your support will go down...
- Come on!

01:28:30.001 --> 01:28:31.501
In history...

01:28:31.709 --> 01:28:36.459
<i>Amazing, the path that destiny takes
to reach its destination.</i>

01:28:36.917 --> 01:28:39.667
<i>It brings about
these moments of crisis,</i>

01:28:40.042 --> 01:28:43.584
<i>but only so I can find the time
to write a second great book.</i>

01:28:43.751 --> 01:28:46.792
What are you doing?
- I'm writing a new book.

01:28:50.959 --> 01:28:52.667
And?
- Completely insane.

01:28:53.667 --> 01:28:56.626
He describes waking up
here in modern Berlin.

01:28:56.792 --> 01:28:58.334
I'm in it, you're in it.

01:28:59.167 --> 01:29:01.126
I can see it made into a movie.

01:29:06.626 --> 01:29:10.834
I have one condition: I want to do
the film adaptation of the book.

01:29:15.042 --> 01:29:16.167
Fine.

01:29:19.126 --> 01:29:21.417
<i>Success was quick to come.</i>

01:29:21.584 --> 01:29:23.209
"TV HITLER WRITES DIARY"

01:29:23.542 --> 01:29:25.751
"NO HITLER = NO AUDIENCE"

01:29:26.251 --> 01:29:29.084
"TV HITLER DONATES
FOR ANIMAL PROTECTION"

01:29:31.709 --> 01:29:33.959
LOOK WHO'S BACK" BOOK PROMOTION

01:29:34.126 --> 01:29:37.501
Respect for how he has coped
with the new world.

01:29:45.459 --> 01:29:49.209
I don't kill anyone,
if it's not absolutely necessary.

01:29:49.584 --> 01:29:52.542
Fear not...
I'm quite a nice guy.

01:29:53.084 --> 01:29:57.126
<i>The Facebook recruiting call
for my new troops was promising,</i>

01:29:57.292 --> 01:30:00.917
<i>but the raw material
left much to be desired.</i>

01:30:04.251 --> 01:30:06.001
My God!

01:30:10.209 --> 01:30:12.584
And 30 more on top of that,

01:30:13.042 --> 01:30:14.792
till you stop laughing.

01:30:15.626 --> 01:30:17.709
Enjoying yourself. Hm?

01:30:18.376 --> 01:30:21.626
Go on, enjoy yourself.
Are you having fun?

01:30:24.542 --> 01:30:26.334
Doesn't look like your laughing now.

01:30:27.376 --> 01:30:28.792
Louder!

01:30:38.209 --> 01:30:39.417
3 MONTHS LATER

01:30:39.584 --> 01:30:43.834
Mr. Sensenbrink, the ratings
are too low to be measured.

01:30:45.084 --> 01:30:47.292
Ad revenue is next to nothing.

01:30:47.626 --> 01:30:49.417
Our liquidity...

01:30:49.876 --> 01:30:52.792
Witzigmann's show
will get us back on track.

01:30:53.959 --> 01:30:58.417
As of now, we broadcast
"Whoa, Dude!" five times a week.

01:31:02.792 --> 01:31:04.709
Mr. Sensenbrink...

01:31:07.917 --> 01:31:10.626
Witzigmann...
- He has quit.

01:31:10.959 --> 01:31:13.709
The show "Whoa, Dude!"
no longer exists.

01:31:19.876 --> 01:31:22.376
The following men will stay in the room:
Rugemon...

01:31:23.584 --> 01:31:25.251
... Lummlich...

01:31:26.084 --> 01:31:29.834
... Mancello... and Nils.

01:31:36.126 --> 01:31:38.626
How dare you?

01:31:39.417 --> 01:31:42.459
"Whoa, Dude!" no longer exists?
I developed that show!

01:31:42.959 --> 01:31:46.251
You are a bunch of incompetent losers!

01:31:52.042 --> 01:31:54.626
How am I to lead a TV station
like this?

01:31:55.126 --> 01:31:57.001
If you all sabotage me?

01:32:01.959 --> 01:32:02.959
My God!

01:32:05.834 --> 01:32:07.126
Out...

01:32:09.542 --> 01:32:11.459
... out, brief candle.

01:32:12.542 --> 01:32:15.084
What if we get Hitler back on board?

01:32:17.542 --> 01:32:21.292
People just can't stay mad at Hitler
for very long.

01:32:21.792 --> 01:32:25.667
And even the people who hate him
go buy his new book.

01:32:26.334 --> 01:32:28.751
Just to see
what his next crazy move is.

01:32:29.084 --> 01:32:32.959
You can't, that's untenable!
- It's selling like hot cakes.

01:32:33.459 --> 01:32:36.126
They're working on the film adaptation.

01:32:36.292 --> 01:32:39.251
We should be taking part in it.

01:32:39.751 --> 01:32:43.001
Hey, you were always against Hitler!
- Of course!

01:32:43.167 --> 01:32:45.084
But I wasn't
managing director at the time.

01:33:04.251 --> 01:33:07.709
This looks... this looks great!

01:33:07.876 --> 01:33:11.501
So this is going to the big screen,
is it?

01:33:12.751 --> 01:33:14.292
Who are you?

01:33:15.209 --> 01:33:17.042
Sawatzki?
- <i>Cut!</i>

01:33:17.501 --> 01:33:20.292
Stop!
- Who just walked onto the set?

01:33:23.751 --> 01:33:25.167
I thought...

01:33:26.126 --> 01:33:28.709
Cool, huh? A silicone mask.

01:33:36.292 --> 01:33:39.042
Is that really Sensenbrink?
- That's him.

01:33:39.376 --> 01:33:42.626
I thought I'd pop by.
I always believed in you.

01:33:42.792 --> 01:33:46.959
Things couldn't be going better.
Oh, do you want one of these?

01:33:47.126 --> 01:33:50.751
Quite clever, isn't it,
with the moustache as title.

01:33:50.917 --> 01:33:52.292
Brilliant.

01:33:53.501 --> 01:33:57.042
And the gag is:
It costs exactly 19.33.

01:33:57.834 --> 01:34:00.959
Like the year 1933...
- I got it.

01:34:01.709 --> 01:34:05.709
Christoph Sensenbrink, this is:
Christoph Sensenbrink.

01:34:05.917 --> 01:34:09.126
How long have I waited for this moment?

01:34:09.626 --> 01:34:11.709
I'm even you in my dreams.

01:34:11.917 --> 01:34:14.542
He's playing me?
- Yes.

01:34:14.959 --> 01:34:17.334
But nobody knows him.

01:34:17.501 --> 01:34:21.001
You could've gotten
Benno Fürmann or Bruno Ganz...

01:34:21.334 --> 01:34:24.167
For such a small role?
Are you kidding?

01:34:24.542 --> 01:34:27.584
Do you have a TV network?
- Talks are underway.

01:34:27.917 --> 01:34:30.876
Pro7, RTL, ZDF, you name it.

01:34:31.376 --> 01:34:34.042
If I know them,
they're all just talk.

01:34:34.209 --> 01:34:37.334
You need a high-powered partner.

01:34:38.042 --> 01:34:42.959
We'll boost your budget by a million,
and in return we broadcast your film.

01:34:48.626 --> 01:34:50.542
Grandma, I'll be right back.

01:34:54.917 --> 01:34:56.126
Hello.
- Hello.

01:34:56.292 --> 01:34:57.584
Hey.

01:34:59.042 --> 01:35:01.084
Hello, Fräulein Krömeier.

01:35:01.251 --> 01:35:03.084
Well, that's taken care of.

01:35:03.376 --> 01:35:06.042
Sorry it's such a mess.
- Don't worry...

01:35:06.751 --> 01:35:09.084
Hitler, may I take your coat?
- Sure...

01:35:11.376 --> 01:35:14.501
Hi, Mrs. Krömeier.
- Sorry to invade like this.

01:35:14.667 --> 01:35:17.126
It can't be.

01:35:17.584 --> 01:35:21.709
I'm honored. Your granddaughter
is a wonderful person.

01:35:22.251 --> 01:35:23.959
It's Hitler!

01:35:24.626 --> 01:35:26.501
Grandma...
- Do something!

01:35:26.834 --> 01:35:29.501
He's not real.
She thinks it's him.

01:35:30.167 --> 01:35:32.626
Think of your family.

01:35:33.084 --> 01:35:36.167
So many people, all of them dead.

01:35:36.834 --> 01:35:38.167
Do something.

01:35:38.334 --> 01:35:42.167
I feel anger and fury
about those days too.

01:35:42.626 --> 01:35:47.167
I will make sure that
no English bomber ever comes close...

01:35:47.501 --> 01:35:49.917
Who said anything about bombs?

01:35:50.542 --> 01:35:53.626
None of them
died in the bombing raids!

01:35:54.001 --> 01:35:57.459
You gassed them!
- Grandma, it's funny, satire!

01:35:57.792 --> 01:35:59.751
He looks the same.

01:36:01.417 --> 01:36:03.376
He says the same things.

01:36:04.751 --> 01:36:07.459
And back then,
people were laughing at first, too.

01:36:12.376 --> 01:36:14.001
I know who you are.

01:36:15.542 --> 01:36:17.584
I haven't forgotten a thing.

01:36:18.334 --> 01:36:20.751
Madam...
- Get out!

01:36:21.084 --> 01:36:24.542
Get out, you criminal!

01:36:25.292 --> 01:36:26.501
Get out!

01:36:28.626 --> 01:36:30.584
Awful.

01:36:31.376 --> 01:36:33.834
Awful...
- Yes.

01:36:34.292 --> 01:36:37.542
... that Fräulein Krömeier is a Jew.

01:36:39.167 --> 01:36:40.459
I'm surprised.

01:36:42.917 --> 01:36:45.917
That's not what I mean.
- You're disappointed.

01:36:46.084 --> 01:36:49.834
Because I wasn't harsh enough
with that old Jewish hag.

01:36:50.001 --> 01:36:52.084
I can understand.

01:36:53.292 --> 01:36:57.584
But as politician, you have to
set priorities, Sawatzki.

01:36:57.876 --> 01:37:03.167
It's like the '36 Olympics. You put
the persecution on hold for three weeks.

01:37:04.209 --> 01:37:06.709
Can't you break character for once?

01:37:07.126 --> 01:37:11.417
I understand that you have
feelings for Fräulein Krömeier, I do.

01:37:11.792 --> 01:37:14.751
Perhaps only a small part of her
is Jewish.

01:37:15.292 --> 01:37:18.959
The body can handle
a certain amount of Jewishness.

01:37:19.917 --> 01:37:22.834
My God, what kind of a person are you?

01:37:34.626 --> 01:37:36.709
The three kids came from there.

01:37:37.042 --> 01:37:39.584
Yes, but I want to know:

01:37:40.542 --> 01:37:43.792
How did you get here,
what happened before that?

01:37:44.334 --> 01:37:45.542
I don't know.

01:37:47.459 --> 01:37:50.834
What?
Were you just beamed over there?

01:37:53.167 --> 01:37:55.167
Fabian, what do you say?

01:37:56.334 --> 01:38:00.084
Didn't you ask yourself
where he came from?

01:38:00.626 --> 01:38:03.751
Time travel?
Or he escaped from the loony bin!

01:38:31.459 --> 01:38:33.459
Let me through.
- No.

01:38:37.792 --> 01:38:41.251
Get out of the way.
Don't you recognize me?

01:38:42.292 --> 01:38:45.251
Why?
Because of your little moustache?

01:38:46.001 --> 01:38:49.834
You're stabbing Germany in the back.
You're a pig.

01:38:50.001 --> 01:38:51.709
A pig that doesn't deserve to

01:38:52.417 --> 01:38:54.584
... live!

01:39:02.876 --> 01:39:05.501
<i>You really gave us a scare.</i>

01:39:05.959 --> 01:39:08.292
<i>Oh... Mrs. Bellini!</i>

01:39:11.417 --> 01:39:14.584
<i>What is this?
- It's all for you.</i>

01:39:15.084 --> 01:39:17.626
<i>Look,
Boris Becker wrote you.</i>

01:39:18.292 --> 01:39:21.126
They all wish you a quick recovery.
- Why?

01:39:21.667 --> 01:39:25.501
<i>Why?
You were beat up by neo-Nazis.</i>

01:39:26.001 --> 01:39:29.542
<i>You're a "Champion of Democracy."
Sigmar Gabriel, vice chancellor.</i>

01:39:29.876 --> 01:39:31.584
Now you're a hero!

01:39:32.751 --> 01:39:33.917
<i>Everything okay?</i>

01:39:34.251 --> 01:39:36.292
I just had to laugh.

01:39:39.417 --> 01:39:40.626
Those amateurs.

01:39:42.376 --> 01:39:45.376
<i>Yes, there's enough.
It's starting to rain.</i>

01:39:45.876 --> 01:39:48.376
<i>We have to finish shooting!</i>

01:39:59.167 --> 01:40:00.834
He's just lying there.

01:40:45.292 --> 01:40:47.459
BUNKER COMPOUND

01:40:51.626 --> 01:40:55.501
HISTORICAL LOCATION
OF THE "FÜHRER BUNKER"

01:41:05.334 --> 01:41:06.584
Where is he?

01:41:07.167 --> 01:41:09.251
Where you should be. On set.

01:41:09.626 --> 01:41:13.376
He's real. I don't know how or why,
but he's the real Adolf Hitler.

01:41:13.751 --> 01:41:17.209
He's very authentic, we know that.

01:41:17.376 --> 01:41:18.834
You don't get it!

01:41:19.209 --> 01:41:22.876
It's Adolf Hitler out there,
not some comedian!

01:41:23.251 --> 01:41:26.834
Why won't you listen to me?
That is Hitler!

01:41:28.209 --> 01:41:31.084
Excuse me?
- He's doing what he always did.

01:41:33.542 --> 01:41:36.001
Can I be any clearer?

01:41:36.334 --> 01:41:39.292
We have to arrest him!
We have to do something...

01:41:40.709 --> 01:41:43.834
Oh my God, we have to...
- Let's take a deep breath.

01:41:45.001 --> 01:41:48.709
Mrs. Bellini, we have no time to lose.

01:41:49.167 --> 01:41:51.876
I don't want any trouble.
- Neither do we.

01:41:53.792 --> 01:41:54.876
Stop him!

01:42:06.209 --> 01:42:07.292
<i>Stop!</i>

01:42:26.584 --> 01:42:28.667
That was very well clone.

01:42:29.084 --> 01:42:31.042
You're good Germans.
Thanks.

01:42:34.167 --> 01:42:35.917
Sawatzki!

01:42:39.834 --> 01:42:42.876
I was wondering when you'd show up.
- It's you.

01:42:43.417 --> 01:42:45.334
You're him.

01:42:45.501 --> 01:42:47.709
I never claimed to be anything else.

01:42:48.417 --> 01:42:49.626
History repeats itself.

01:42:49.792 --> 01:42:54.501
I guess it's my fate to have to part
with my dearest companions.

01:42:55.542 --> 01:42:56.626
That way!

01:42:57.001 --> 01:42:59.834
Yes, history repeats itself.

01:43:01.292 --> 01:43:03.751
You're fooling people
with your propaganda.

01:43:04.084 --> 01:43:05.792
Oh, Sawatzki...

01:43:06.459 --> 01:43:08.209
You don't understand.

01:43:08.376 --> 01:43:13.709
In 1933, people were not
fooled by propaganda.

01:43:14.126 --> 01:43:15.584
They elected a leader,

01:43:16.001 --> 01:43:19.167
who openly disclosed his plans
in great clarity.

01:43:22.167 --> 01:43:25.126
The Germans elected me.

01:43:58.751 --> 01:43:59.917
Go on.

01:44:11.084 --> 01:44:14.042
You're a monster.
- Am I?

01:44:14.959 --> 01:44:19.376
Then you have to condemn those
who elected this monster.

01:44:20.917 --> 01:44:24.584
Were they all monsters?
No, they were ordinary people

01:44:25.917 --> 01:44:28.751
who chose to elect
an extraordinary man,

01:44:29.167 --> 01:44:31.626
and entrust the fate
of the country to him.

01:44:32.042 --> 01:44:34.292
What do you want to do, Sawatzki?

01:44:34.667 --> 01:44:35.834
Ban elections?

01:44:36.209 --> 01:44:38.542
No, but I'm going to stop you.

01:44:39.167 --> 01:44:42.334
Have you never asked yourself...

01:44:43.459 --> 01:44:45.959
... why people follow me?

01:44:48.376 --> 01:44:51.792
Because at their core,
they are just like me.

01:44:56.959 --> 01:44:58.709
They have the same values.

01:45:06.876 --> 01:45:09.959
And that's why you won't shoot.

01:45:48.376 --> 01:45:50.792
You can't get rid of me.

01:46:01.501 --> 01:46:03.292
I'm a part of you.

01:46:03.792 --> 01:46:05.584
A part of all of you.

01:46:06.459 --> 01:46:08.667
And look: It wasn't all bad.

01:46:16.792 --> 01:46:19.084
And cut!
Thanks!

01:46:19.709 --> 01:46:21.084
<i>Stop.</i>

01:46:21.501 --> 01:46:23.209
Thank you!

01:46:28.667 --> 01:46:31.834
That's a wrap, people!

01:46:40.834 --> 01:46:41.917
Bam!

01:46:44.501 --> 01:46:45.959
No, knock it off.

01:46:49.417 --> 01:46:52.459
Quiet!
The boss wants to say something!

01:46:53.751 --> 01:46:56.251
It's fine for everyone to celebrate.

01:46:56.542 --> 01:47:00.084
But we also want
to remember our comrades,

01:47:00.834 --> 01:47:02.751
who can no longer be with us.

01:47:25.667 --> 01:47:28.834
A comedy with Hitler,
will that work?

01:47:29.167 --> 01:47:32.417
There's German comedy
before and after Hitler.

01:47:32.584 --> 01:47:36.834
He's taken entertainment
to a whole new level.

01:47:37.001 --> 01:47:39.251
Not even Loriot managed that.

01:47:39.584 --> 01:47:43.542
What would happen if the real Hitler
returned? Would history repeat itself?

01:47:43.709 --> 01:47:47.542
For the past 70 years,
our entire history was fixated on that.

01:47:47.709 --> 01:47:50.417
Students are sick of hearing
about the Third Reich.

01:47:50.751 --> 01:47:53.501
I think, we should have a little faith.

01:47:54.501 --> 01:47:56.542
Thank you very much.
- Thanks.

01:48:15.334 --> 01:48:20.042
<i>He's back
He's back here again</i>

01:48:24.792 --> 01:48:29.917
<i>He's back
So they tell me</i>

01:48:33.834 --> 01:48:36.876
<i>That he wasn't with me</i>

01:48:39.209 --> 01:48:42.126
<i>I cannot understand</i>

01:48:43.251 --> 01:48:47.876
<i>And I wonder
What has happened?</i>

01:48:52.459 --> 01:48:57.167
<i>He's back
But not with me</i>

01:49:01.792 --> 01:49:04.084
<i>And he does not ring at my door</i>

01:49:04.501 --> 01:49:07.084
<i>And I don't know why</i>

01:49:11.167 --> 01:49:14.542
<i>All the people in town</i>

01:49:16.001 --> 01:49:19.001
<i>Have seen him around</i>

01:49:20.167 --> 01:49:24.667
<i>He's back
What has happened?</i>

01:49:29.501 --> 01:49:34.126
<i>In all our letters we wrote</i>

01:49:34.751 --> 01:49:36.792
<i>Only of the happiness</i>

01:49:38.209 --> 01:49:43.626
<i>And how it will be for the two of us</i>

01:49:47.626 --> 01:49:53.584
<i>But one day no more letters came back</i>

01:49:54.917 --> 01:49:56.959
<i>Is it all over?</i>

01:49:57.126 --> 01:49:59.709
<i>Is it all over and done?</i>

01:50:07.417 --> 01:50:11.626
<i>I'm not against foreigners, Turks,
Syrians, I just have a problem...</i>

01:50:12.001 --> 01:50:14.709
<i>Everything has a deeper meaning.</i>

01:50:15.042 --> 01:50:18.751
<i>The situation is great for me
in Germany, Europe, the world.</i>

01:50:19.084 --> 01:50:21.251
NO ISLAMICIZATION OF EUROPE
NO PLACE TO FLEE TO

01:50:21.417 --> 01:50:25.417
<i>The Austrian government
is a puppet government!</i>

01:50:27.751 --> 01:50:31.876
<i>People who come to Sweden
should adapt to our lifestyle.</i>

01:50:33.542 --> 01:50:38.209
<i>Riots in from' of a refugee home.
A building is burned to the ground.</i>

01:50:51.876 --> 01:50:53.917
<i>... it will change our country.</i>

01:50:54.251 --> 01:50:57.792
<i>It is the spectre of Islam.</i>

01:51:02.876 --> 01:51:07.959
<i>They come from Tunisia and Morocco,
where we Germans go on holiday!</i>

01:51:10.042 --> 01:51:12.167
<i>We are the people!</i>

01:51:12.334 --> 01:51:14.667
<i>I can work with this.</i>

01:51:15.001 --> 01:51:16.834
<i>We are the people!</i>

01:55:29.667 --> 01:55:32.542
