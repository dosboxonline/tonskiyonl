06:22.758 --> 06:24.301
<i>Apurense, muchachos.</i>

06:26.136 --> 06:28.806
This is Deputy Sheriff Oscar Garcia.

06:28.972 --> 06:32.226
You are all under arrest
for horse stealing. Drop your guns.

06:32.393 --> 06:35.020
<i>;Echale con tu chingada madre, cabrén!</i>

06:54.790 --> 06:58.293
(shouting in Spanish)

07:22.359 --> 07:25.696
You gonna steal these horses
back from me? Huh? Policeman?

07:25.863 --> 07:29.074
These are my horses!

07:29.241 --> 07:33.162
Garcia, Ramos, policemen...

07:33.328 --> 07:34.663
 Orale!

07:34.830 --> 07:37.833
You'll never get away with this.
You can't kill a policeman.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.376
They'll hunt you down.

07:39.543 --> 07:42.129
<i>Hijo de perra!</i>

07:42.296 --> 07:44.631
I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

07:48.177 --> 07:51.138
I'm gonna teach him a lesson.

07:54.224 --> 07:59.229
Some of these guys
are a lot taller than me.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.819
A whole head taller.

08:08.572 --> 08:11.241
<i>;Pues de la chingada!
Qué esté pasando?</i>

08:13.494 --> 08:18.582
Hey, you, cabrén! You're hurting
my cars, pendejo! Why you do that?

08:18.749 --> 08:21.960
This is J.J. McQuade, Texas Ranger.

08:22.669 --> 08:24.004
Hey, hey, he)', he)'-

08:24.171 --> 08:26.006
Put 'em down.

08:27.716 --> 08:31.678
- Do not move.
- "Do not move." (cackles)

08:33.388 --> 08:37.558
Hey, you. Stand up like a man
so I can see you.

08:57.371 --> 08:58.455
<i>Puta!</i>

08:58.622 --> 09:02.042
Oh, no, no, no, no, no!

09:03.001 --> 09:05.754
There! You think I care
about your pinche friend now?

09:05.921 --> 09:08.757
Put down your weapon
or I'll shoot this man!

09:08.924 --> 09:12.094
I say I'll shoot this man, motherfucker!

09:13.595 --> 09:16.890
Better listen to me, cabrén!

09:17.057 --> 09:19.351
Right now! Come down!

09:20.269 --> 09:24.481
Ranger! I'm gonna kill this man!
Drop your weapon! Qué quieres?

09:24.648 --> 09:28.360
Ain't no one ever killed no
Texas Ranger and lived to tell it.

09:28.527 --> 09:34.741
He ain't that big. Muchachos, come down.
Show our honored guest some respect.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.828
(laughs)

09:57.556 --> 09:59.266
<i>Echa, hijo puta!</i>

10:22.914 --> 10:26.376
I've never seen
a Texas Ranger up close before.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.212
You know,

10:29.379 --> 10:33.425
once a Texas Ranger
kicked my father's teeth out.

10:33.592 --> 10:36.511
Would you do that to me, Texas Ranger?

11:05.582 --> 11:07.250
Don't shoot me.

11:13.215 --> 11:17.844
Don't shoot me! You already kicked
my teeth out! What else do you want?

11:18.011 --> 11:20.097
Like father, like son.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.100
Come on.

11:23.266 --> 11:26.645
(shouts in Spanish)

11:26.812 --> 11:29.439
Get back, kid.
Stay there and I'll cut you loose.

11:29.606 --> 11:34.820
I just wanna say thank you.
Thank you. You were great.

11:34.986 --> 11:39.449
OK, OK, kid. OK.
Go cut your buddies loose. Go on.

11:39.616 --> 11:42.619
<i>Chinga a tu madre, puto.</i>

11:42.786 --> 11:45.038
Come on. I'm gonna fix your teeth.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.708
(continues shouting in Spanish)

12:04.391 --> 12:06.727
(siren)

12:09.813 --> 12:13.191
(PA) We present to you, Dakota Brown...

12:13.358 --> 12:16.862
(cheering and applause)

12:21.992 --> 12:25.954
for 38 years of unrivalled performance
as a Texas Ranger...

12:31.460 --> 12:34.212
for over 2,000 felony arrests...

12:34.379 --> 12:37.549
(cheering and applause)

12:42.095 --> 12:46.433
for serving the great state of Texas
with fearless devotion...

12:49.561 --> 12:51.521
this gold watch...

12:54.608 --> 12:57.486
and honorary plaque.

12:57.652 --> 13:02.199
(Dakota) Hey, how about that?
How about that? Ain't that somethin'?

13:02.365 --> 13:04.576
Dakota.

13:05.994 --> 13:08.371
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

13:08.538 --> 13:09.790
(snores)

13:09.956 --> 13:11.875
It's a real honor.

13:12.042 --> 13:15.086
<i>Adios, amigos. Hasta la vista.</i>

13:20.258 --> 13:24.346
Thank you, folks. Drive careful
goin' home now, you hear me?

13:29.893 --> 13:33.188
- Good speech, Dakota.
- The hell with it. Did you get 'em?

13:33.355 --> 13:36.900
- You bet.
- Sorry I was at this hand-job session.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.903
- I'd love to have helped.
- I could have used you.

13:40.070 --> 13:42.656
- Dakota?
- Yeah, Captain?

13:42.823 --> 13:44.658
Can't say as I'm gonna miss you.

13:46.451 --> 13:49.913
Thank you very much, Captain.
And thank you for the watch.

13:50.080 --> 13:53.124
- And you, McQuade...
- Drink, Captain?

13:53.291 --> 13:55.418
My office in ten minutes.

13:59.172 --> 14:02.300
"And you, McQuade..." (laughs)

14:05.637 --> 14:06.847
Hey, McQuade.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.065
Hi, there.

14:35.458 --> 14:38.128
- Captain?
- Sit down, McQuade.

14:41.631 --> 14:45.594
You think you're pretty damn good,
don't you, MoQuade?

14:45.760 --> 14:47.637
In case you didn't know it there's more

14:47.804 --> 14:50.599
to being a Texas Ranger
than making busts.

14:50.765 --> 14:54.477
- You gotta look good doing it.
- (toilet flushes)

14:54.644 --> 14:56.104
Style.

14:58.106 --> 15:00.358
The best always have style.

15:13.705 --> 15:16.917
- I said, sit down.
- I'll stand, Captain.

15:19.502 --> 15:24.090
Now, in terms of
unassisted felony arrests,

15:24.257 --> 15:27.093
I admit your record is unrivalled.

15:27.260 --> 15:32.057
But my kind of Ranger
is a model citizen.

15:32.223 --> 15:34.142
A pillar in the community.
Goes to church.

15:34.309 --> 15:39.356
He lives clean
and he's got a lovin' wife and kids.

15:39.522 --> 15:40.607
Read it.

15:44.486 --> 15:48.365
It's an editorial by the senator who
happens to approve our annual budget.

15:48.531 --> 15:52.202
I quote: "Ranger J.J. McQuade
is a walking symbol

15:52.369 --> 15:54.454
of the brutal, uncooperative, obsolete

15:54.621 --> 15:57.540
and discriminatory nature
of Rangers today."

15:57.707 --> 15:59.209
Unquote.

16:03.922 --> 16:07.050
Well, your "lone wolf" attitude
is gonna change.

16:07.217 --> 16:10.720
You're going to start cooperating
with the state and federal agencies.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.430
Understand?

16:15.183 --> 16:17.852
(knocking at door)

16:17.852 --> 16:18.687
Come in.

16:22.273 --> 16:24.401
- You wanted to see me, Captain?
- Yes.

16:24.567 --> 16:28.738
Ranger, meet your new partner.
Deputy Arcadio Ramos.

16:28.905 --> 16:31.282
Arcadio. You can just call me Kayo.

16:34.452 --> 16:35.578
You gotta be kidding.

16:37.580 --> 16:38.707
(clears throat)

16:38.873 --> 16:43.211
- It'll be an honor workin' with you.
- Forget it, kid. I work alone.

16:43.378 --> 16:45.380
Where'd you get that piece?

16:45.547 --> 16:48.341
- That's what I'm gonna find out.
- Ranger?

16:53.138 --> 16:54.597
Stay with it, son.

17:33.636 --> 17:37.724
Our Russian friends have failed us. We
will have to finance the coup ourselves.

17:37.891 --> 17:39.934
(speaks Spanish)

17:40.101 --> 17:42.812
The shipment has to be in Havana
before Wednesday.

17:42.979 --> 17:44.481
Splendid.

17:50.361 --> 17:52.322
Would you like to count it,
Sefior Wilkes?

17:52.489 --> 17:55.992
Trust is the most important thing
in our business.

17:56.159 --> 17:58.036
Of course it is.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.664
Now, have the plane loaded at once.

18:01.831 --> 18:05.335
I am in a hurry
to get back to Havana, Sefior Wilkes.

18:05.502 --> 18:07.295
Quickly, now.

18:24.020 --> 18:25.855
That quick enough?

18:33.196 --> 18:34.697
Bury them.

18:58.054 --> 18:59.430
Ranger?

19:05.478 --> 19:07.105
Ranger?

19:22.078 --> 19:24.289
Good dog. Good wolf.

19:26.583 --> 19:29.043
Good boy. Good wolf.

19:33.256 --> 19:34.799
(whistles)

19:38.469 --> 19:40.221
<i>Chingao.</i>

19:40.388 --> 19:42.348
What a pisshouse.

19:46.603 --> 19:47.937
Ranger?

19:59.699 --> 20:01.659
What are you doing here?

20:01.826 --> 20:06.998
I came to wake you up.
I'm your new partner, remember?

20:08.833 --> 20:11.211
Kid, get out of here.
And forget that partner crap.

20:11.377 --> 20:13.463
But Captain Tyler...

20:13.630 --> 20:15.089
Tell Tyler to shove it!

20:16.674 --> 20:18.468
<i>;Chinga a su madre!</i>

20:56.673 --> 20:58.549
Holy shit.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.292
Hey, Ranger, I'd like to apologize.

21:32.458 --> 21:35.461
I didn't mean to barge in on you
this morning.

21:50.226 --> 21:52.437
You can't outrun me.
I got superchargers.

21:52.603 --> 21:54.063
Oh, yeah?

21:59.360 --> 22:00.862
Supercharge this.

22:04.073 --> 22:05.450
(Kayo) Damn!

22:09.287 --> 22:10.913
Oh, piss.

22:16.252 --> 22:17.420
Dammit, Ranger!

22:20.006 --> 22:23.801
Aaah! Oh, sh... Aaargh!

22:32.101 --> 22:34.896
<i>La pura pinche madre!</i>

22:38.399 --> 22:40.860
<i>Pinche</i> cabrén, Ranger.

22:53.915 --> 22:55.333
Daddy!

22:55.500 --> 22:58.294
- Daddy, hey!
- Hey, sugar.

23:00.797 --> 23:02.256
Hey, what's this, huh?

23:03.758 --> 23:07.303
- About time you stopped by.
- I thought you might like to go riding.

23:07.470 --> 23:09.389
- You mean it?
- I'm takin' the day off.

23:09.555 --> 23:11.808
All right!

23:11.974 --> 23:14.352
- I didn't know you took days off.
- Hi, Molly.

23:14.519 --> 23:18.106
- Where have you been, stranger?
- I've been real busy.

23:18.272 --> 23:20.316
Oh, boy. Same old trouble?

23:20.483 --> 23:21.984
My kinda trouble doesn't
take vacations.

23:22.151 --> 23:23.778
Aren't you gonna tell Dad the big news?

23:23.945 --> 23:25.696
Oh, honey.

23:26.864 --> 23:28.449
Mom, I...

23:28.616 --> 23:30.034
What news?

23:31.327 --> 23:34.997
Jim, I got a real good job
in Las Cruces.

23:35.164 --> 23:36.332
Las Cruces?

23:36.499 --> 23:38.167
We're gonna move there in two weeks.

23:40.336 --> 23:43.506
- What do you mean "move"?
- Don't get all worked up.

23:43.673 --> 23:46.801
I'm an independent woman now
and I got my own life to live.

23:46.968 --> 23:49.679
I know, but you can
make your life right here.

23:49.846 --> 23:51.222
- Oh, Jim.
- (car pulls up)

23:53.516 --> 23:57.687
One day you're gonna meet some real nice
gal who won't mind sitting up nights,

23:57.854 --> 24:01.691
waitin' to see if you're
gonna come home in one piece.

24:01.858 --> 24:05.611
Oh, come on, Jim. It's a nice town,
it'll be good for Sally.

24:07.321 --> 24:10.074
- Honey?
- Oh, hell.

24:11.659 --> 24:14.203
Daddy, this is my boyfriend,
Bobby Drew.

24:15.204 --> 24:16.539
Boyfriend?

24:16.706 --> 24:18.374
I heard a lot about you.

24:18.541 --> 24:22.128
You were in the Marines,
won a Silver Star and everything.

24:28.342 --> 24:32.138
- Nice to meet you, Bobby.
- Nice to meet you, Ranger.

24:32.305 --> 24:34.015
Bobby, Daddy's takin' me riding.

24:34.182 --> 24:37.059
I hope you don't mind.
I'll see you tonight, OK?

24:37.226 --> 24:39.145
Uh, yeah, sure.

24:39.312 --> 24:41.397
- See you later.
- Have a good old time.

24:45.443 --> 24:47.820
Bye. See you later.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.991
Bye, Mom! See ya!

25:28.486 --> 25:30.780
(Sally) I'm ready to take Foxy out now.

25:30.947 --> 25:34.283
- (Dakota) Just be patient.
- OK.

25:34.450 --> 25:36.035
All right. I'm ready to go.

25:36.202 --> 25:39.539
Pay attention, dummy.
She's got some mustang in her.

25:39.705 --> 25:42.792
- I can handle her, OK? Let's go.
- OK.

25:42.959 --> 25:45.962
- Be careful, honey.
- OK. Easy, Foxy.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.968
Hey. How'd you like to bite
that in the butt,

25:52.134 --> 25:54.971
develop lockjaw and be
dragged to death?

25:55.137 --> 25:57.640
- Who is she?
- Clark Richardson's widow.

25:57.807 --> 25:59.725
- That's her, huh?
- That's her.

25:59.892 --> 26:02.687
From a poor family.
Married Clark with all that money

26:02.853 --> 26:08.317
just before he got himself squashed in
that Italian racing job. Quite a crash.

26:08.484 --> 26:12.405
Clark ran with a pretty tough crowd
and talk is it wasn't an accident.

26:12.572 --> 26:14.115
But nobody can prove it.

26:14.282 --> 26:19.078
Shame, though.
All that fruit just rotting on the vine

26:19.245 --> 26:20.663
Doesn't look too rotten to me.

26:24.625 --> 26:27.003
- Sally!
- FOXy!

26:29.672 --> 26:32.174
' Sally!
' Help me!

26:36.804 --> 26:38.973
Help!

26:51.444 --> 26:54.280
It's all right. It's OK.

26:56.532 --> 26:58.576
- You all right, honey?
- Yeah.

27:00.911 --> 27:02.997
Thank you.

27:03.164 --> 27:05.791
- What's your name?
- Sally.

27:05.958 --> 27:09.211
- Next time, Sally, be more careful.
- I will.

27:09.378 --> 27:14.967
I wanna thank you for what you did.
The name's Jim McQuade.

27:15.134 --> 27:18.638
The infamous Texas Ranger.
Pleased to meet you.

27:18.804 --> 27:20.890
(car horn)

27:31.275 --> 27:35.655
This is Rawley Wilkes, my late husband's
partner. Ranger McQuade.

27:35.821 --> 27:37.073
And now you're my partner.

27:38.824 --> 27:41.661
I understand you're very good
with your hands and feet.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.996
Pretty good.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.040
Rawley was all-European
karate champion.

27:46.207 --> 27:48.125
Is that right?

27:50.211 --> 27:52.630
Ranger Brown. Sally.

27:52.797 --> 27:55.007
Ranger McQuade, it was especially nice.

28:01.389 --> 28:06.352
Oh, by the way, Rawley's giving a little
martial arts display by the racetrack.

28:06.519 --> 28:11.399
- Just a little exhibition.
- Why don't you gentlemen drop on by?

28:11.565 --> 28:15.903
- I don't think we...
- Oh, it'd be our pleasure, ma'am.

28:16.070 --> 28:17.071
Good.

28:35.923 --> 28:37.675
Hey, Foxy.

28:39.301 --> 28:42.596
- Wait. What are you doin'?
- I wanna ride.

28:42.763 --> 28:47.476
- Are you sure?
- Sure I'm sure. Excuse me, please.

28:47.643 --> 28:49.478
Gallop. Let's go.

28:52.231 --> 28:57.319
Never backs down, does she? Reminds
you of somebody else in her family.

29:01.657 --> 29:06.829
<i>J' But choosin's never easy and
I can't decide which one I'd rather see</i>

29:09.081 --> 29:11.125
<i>J' There's a woman from El Paso</i>

29:11.292 --> 29:14.837
<i>J' And I know she will
be comin' here this evening</i>

29:16.714 --> 29:22.470
<i>J' She'll be wearing a red dress and I
know the one with whom she'll be leavin'</i>

29:24.513 --> 29:26.640
<i>J' There's another girl from Dallas...</i>

29:29.685 --> 29:33.105
- You got Pearl beer?
- No. Heineken, Michelob or Dos Equis.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.857
Forget it.

29:36.567 --> 29:38.694
- Bottom shelf, Sam.
- Yes, ma'am.

29:52.625 --> 29:55.044
(woman) It's Rawley showing off.

30:04.178 --> 30:07.223
This should be very interesting.

31:10.327 --> 31:15.958
I see we are graced with the presence of
a media favorite, Ranger J.J. McQuade.

31:20.796 --> 31:24.091
Care to go for one, Ranger?
A little wager, perhaps?

31:31.473 --> 31:34.894
No, thanks. I don't fight for money.

31:53.495 --> 31:56.165
I don't want you dancin'
with no greaser.

31:57.333 --> 31:59.710
You are a greaser, aren't you?

32:23.192 --> 32:24.693
Excuse me a minute.

32:27.154 --> 32:30.324
- Quit while you're ahead, partner.
- Who the hell asked you?

32:30.491 --> 32:32.076
Let me show you.

32:35.371 --> 32:36.372
Come on, tough guy.

33:01.563 --> 33:04.400
Boys are just havin' a little fun.

33:04.566 --> 33:06.235
Do you wanna join the fun?

33:16.161 --> 33:18.747
This is not my idea of fun!

33:23.836 --> 33:27.756
Please let me apologize. Some of my
friends could learn a little manners.

33:27.923 --> 33:30.134
Maybe you need some new friends.

33:33.929 --> 33:35.597
Music! Play!

33:37.808 --> 33:40.310
(cackles)

33:46.984 --> 33:49.903
This was my party.

33:53.240 --> 33:55.451
We should have booked those bastards.

33:55.617 --> 33:57.536
If I locked up every guy
who took a swing at me,

33:57.703 --> 33:59.538
half the county'd be behind bars.

34:01.457 --> 34:05.753
Well, you're makin' a real habit
of saving my ass. I appreciate it.

34:05.919 --> 34:10.132
- You take a good punch, kid.
- I'll take old hamburger-face home.

34:10.299 --> 34:12.176
- Good idea.
- Come on, boy.

34:20.851 --> 34:24.605
You look like you could use
a change of scenery. Come on.

34:33.822 --> 34:35.114
I'll drive.

34:41.455 --> 34:43.998
<i>Cuidado, mis cuates, la chota.</i>

34:49.838 --> 34:51.422
Not too popular, are you?

34:53.007 --> 34:54.842
They understand me.

34:55.886 --> 34:57.346
<i>Por favor.</i>

34:58.764 --> 35:02.851
<i>Una botella de mezcal, dos limones
y si me puede /impiar la mesa. Gracias.</i>

35:03.018 --> 35:05.229
- Mezcal?
- Yes.

35:10.192 --> 35:11.735
How about a kiss, baby?

35:14.196 --> 35:15.447
Excuse me.

35:19.535 --> 35:20.869
Time to leave.

35:24.248 --> 35:25.374
Watch out!

35:40.973 --> 35:43.851
- Sally, get back here.
- Nope.

35:45.602 --> 35:49.189
Hey, come on. Open up.
Let me in. Come on, Sally.

35:49.356 --> 35:51.358
- Nope.
- Come on, open the door. Let me in.

35:51.525 --> 35:55.445
- You promise you won't try anything?
- I promise. Let me in.

35:55.612 --> 35:57.906
OK.

35:58.073 --> 35:59.992
- Aaargh!
- Bobby!

36:00.159 --> 36:02.911
- You promised. Cut it out.
- I lied.

36:03.078 --> 36:06.248
(trucks starting up)

36:06.415 --> 36:09.918
- What is it?
- It's coming from down on the highway.

36:10.085 --> 36:11.920
Stay here.

36:12.754 --> 36:14.256
Bobby?

36:29.104 --> 36:31.023
(gunfire)

36:31.190 --> 36:32.482
Holy shit.

36:37.529 --> 36:38.614
Let's get out of here.

36:44.286 --> 36:45.829
Get down.

36:53.462 --> 36:55.214
What do you guys want?

36:57.299 --> 36:58.800
No!

36:58.967 --> 37:01.929
Bobby! No!

37:05.432 --> 37:07.851
(screaming and sobbing)

37:54.940 --> 37:56.692
See you around.

38:37.774 --> 38:40.402
<i>(woman on radio) Come in, 6R1.
Can you read me?</i>

38:42.321 --> 38:44.656
- 6R1 here. Over.
- Roger, <i>6R1.</i>

38:44.823 --> 38:48.535
<i>We've got a multiple fatality and injury
on 1-10 south of Estelline.</i>

38:48.702 --> 38:51.413
I'm going home. ls there anyone closer?

38:51.580 --> 38:55.917
<i>Negative. You'd better go. We've been
notified that your daughter's involved.</i>

38:56.084 --> 38:59.254
- My daughter?
- (siren)

39:07.512 --> 39:09.848
- Sally McQuade.
- Room 418.

39:11.350 --> 39:13.101
Ranger! Wait!

39:19.816 --> 39:21.985
Please. She needs rest.

39:23.278 --> 39:24.780
She was very lucky.

39:30.077 --> 39:31.453
Bobby...

39:47.677 --> 39:49.388
<i>Bueno.</i>

39:52.307 --> 39:54.893
(siren)

40:11.076 --> 40:12.411
Howdy, Ranger.

40:12.577 --> 40:14.996
The feds. They've taken over.

40:15.163 --> 40:18.083
Marcus Jackson, FBI, Houston.

40:18.250 --> 40:20.961
- McQuade, Texas Ranger.
- I know.

40:21.128 --> 40:24.297
I'm sorry about your daughter,
but this is a federal case.

40:24.464 --> 40:26.675
From now on,
it's out of your jurisdiction

40:26.842 --> 40:29.636
There's brass everywhere. 9mm.

40:31.221 --> 40:33.682
Excuse me. Get it to the lab.

40:33.849 --> 40:35.851
I want a ballistics report.
Let's see what we got.

40:36.017 --> 40:39.354
I guess this is his show.

40:39.521 --> 40:41.898
There were pages blowin'
all over the place when I got here.

40:42.065 --> 40:45.694
I kept this one.

40:47.446 --> 40:50.198
It's a logbook page
from an army convoy.

40:50.365 --> 40:51.867
Fort Nelson.

40:53.285 --> 40:54.286
Ranger?

41:02.961 --> 41:07.299
- Hello. Lieutenant <i>Dade,</i> Shipping.
- McQuade, Texas Ranger, El Paso.

41:07.466 --> 41:10.385
I'm calling to verify
that shipment number...

41:10.552 --> 41:13.555
5501 left Fort Nelson yesterday.

41:13.722 --> 41:15.390
<i>Yes, sir, it certainly did.</i>

41:15.557 --> 41:17.267
What were the contents of those trucks?

41:17.434 --> 41:19.603
<i>Sir, I'm not at liberty to say.</i>

41:19.769 --> 41:21.521
<i>- Who is?
- Colonel McNeil, sir.</i>

41:21.688 --> 41:23.857
- Would you connect me, please?
- Yes, sir.

41:24.024 --> 41:26.067
(knock at door)

41:26.234 --> 41:29.821
- Colonel McNeil's office.
- Could I speak to the colonel?

41:29.988 --> 41:32.657
- He isn't in today.
- When do you expect him?

41:32.824 --> 41:34.701
<i>- I haven't the faintest idea.
- Where is he?</i>

41:34.868 --> 41:37.913
<i>- I don't know.
- Lady, what the hell do you know?</i>

41:38.079 --> 41:40.749
<i>I only work for the colonel.
I don't sleep with him.</i>

41:40.916 --> 41:42.584
You won't get anywhere that way, Ranger.

41:44.044 --> 41:45.837
Follow me.

41:57.557 --> 42:00.769
- What the hell are you doing?
- Accessing into Aristotle.

42:00.936 --> 42:04.105
- Who?
- The military central computer.

42:04.272 --> 42:07.692
You see, I borrowed the codes
from the Texas Criminal Info Center.

42:16.243 --> 42:18.537
- Shit.
- If you get it figured out, kid,

42:18.703 --> 42:19.996
let me know.

42:21.748 --> 42:24.292
Wait, Ranger, I'm in. I got it.

42:26.044 --> 42:27.420
I got it.

42:32.801 --> 42:35.178
They got a shitload of guns. Oh, man.

42:37.138 --> 42:39.599
- Look at that.
- Holy shit.

42:43.436 --> 42:47.482
- Good job, kid. Really a good job.
- Thanks, Ranger.

43:09.504 --> 43:12.090
(McQuade) Here's our little Judas goat.

43:19.723 --> 43:21.975
- What's his connection?
- His name's Snow.

43:22.142 --> 43:24.686
Hustler, dealer, pimp, you name it.

43:24.853 --> 43:27.689
There isn't any dirt
he doesn't have his hands in.

43:34.696 --> 43:36.906
What do you say
we pay him a visit, Ranger?

43:38.199 --> 43:39.492
Let's go.

43:49.878 --> 43:51.671
- You gonna park?
- Hang on.

43:51.838 --> 43:52.839
What?

44:15.528 --> 44:17.197
You're learning, kid.

44:31.002 --> 44:33.254
I see I got a lot more to learn.

44:33.421 --> 44:34.839
Come on, kid.

44:36.216 --> 44:38.093
Son of a bitch.

44:54.901 --> 44:56.236
Whoops.

45:06.079 --> 45:07.288
<i>(I 3efiora?</i>

45:07.455 --> 45:10.291
<i>;Dondé fue el hombre que pasé ahorita?</i>

45:12.752 --> 45:14.045
<i>Gracias.</i>

45:48.872 --> 45:51.916
- Remember me, Snow?
- J-Jesus!

45:52.083 --> 45:53.334
Watch it!

46:19.027 --> 46:20.361
Round the front.

46:27.452 --> 46:28.995
<i>Muchas gracias.</i>

47:11.329 --> 47:13.915
Goddammit! Shit!

48:05.967 --> 48:07.260
Don't!

48:12.932 --> 48:15.977
- No! No!
- Come on!

48:16.144 --> 48:18.271
(Snow moans and whimpers)

48:29.073 --> 48:30.700
Come on.

48:30.867 --> 48:34.162
- Take him.
- I'll call the fire department.

48:34.329 --> 48:36.956
Later. I need to talk to him
before I let the feds have him.

48:45.882 --> 48:48.927
You're gettin' more slippery
all the time, ain't you?

48:50.261 --> 48:54.015
Come on. How many times
have I busted you, you son of a bitch?

48:56.434 --> 49:00.146
- Argh! It hurts my hand!
- Yeah, it does, don't it?

49:05.068 --> 49:07.195
(Snow) You son of a bitch!

49:08.529 --> 49:10.281
Can I borrow that contraption?

49:13.952 --> 49:15.203
Sure.

49:32.220 --> 49:33.638
What are you gonna do?

49:49.153 --> 49:50.655
Stop! Wait!

49:53.199 --> 49:55.535
(Dakota) Got something to say, pissant?

49:55.702 --> 49:59.247
I know who you want.
It's the Mexican Mafia man, Falcon.

49:59.414 --> 50:01.165
Emilio Falcon?

50:01.332 --> 50:04.627
They're heistin' guns everywhere.
All they can get.

50:04.794 --> 50:06.796
What are they gonna do
with all that hardware?

50:08.423 --> 50:13.094
I said, what are they gonna do
with all that hardware?

50:17.140 --> 50:19.600
Shit! They fly 'em off to Mexico,

50:19.767 --> 50:22.478
to Central America,
to terrorists and stuff!

50:22.645 --> 50:24.647
All over the place.

50:26.024 --> 50:27.775
I don't know.

50:27.942 --> 50:32.113
They're gonna kill my son, man!
Goddammit!

50:33.781 --> 50:36.200
Please? Please?

50:36.367 --> 50:39.245
Please, man. Let me go, goddammit.

50:39.412 --> 50:44.625
You stay right there, boy.
Don't you even breathe fast.

50:52.967 --> 50:55.136
Thanks. I figured
you'd bring him around.

50:55.303 --> 50:57.638
It has been my pleasure, J.J.

51:02.310 --> 51:04.645
Hang onto him till I get back.

51:04.812 --> 51:08.483
I'm gonna clean up
and pay a little visit to Sefior Falcon.

51:08.649 --> 51:12.528
- What about me, Ranger?
- Hold down the fort... partner.

51:12.695 --> 51:14.113
<i>Bueno.</i>

51:18.034 --> 51:22.080
Let's go have
another little talk with our guest.

51:22.246 --> 51:26.334
(Snow) What you gonna do? What you
gonna do, man? I'm not soared of you.

51:44.936 --> 51:48.106
(singing)

51:51.901 --> 51:53.820
What the hell...?

51:53.986 --> 51:55.279
Damn!

51:56.531 --> 51:58.741
(singing and sound of vacuum cleaner)

52:10.711 --> 52:13.214
(she sings loudly)

52:15.049 --> 52:17.176
- What the hell are you doing?
- Oh, hi.

52:17.343 --> 52:21.722
- I just thought I'd clean up a bit.
- Lady, if I want a maid, I'll hire one.

52:21.889 --> 52:27.186
Jim, you're a hopeless slob.
Let me have my cord.

52:27.353 --> 52:29.605
What's this?

52:29.772 --> 52:31.274
Vitamins.

52:34.068 --> 52:36.571
Where's my beer?

52:36.737 --> 52:39.240
In the garbage.

52:54.088 --> 52:56.591
Can't you see you're killing yourself?

53:00.386 --> 53:02.722
Lady...

53:02.889 --> 53:07.602
if I want to kill myself,
it's my own business.

53:16.694 --> 53:19.947
Fine. That's just fine.

53:20.114 --> 53:21.908
<i>Adios.</i>

53:25.244 --> 53:28.080
(door slams)

53:28.247 --> 53:30.291
Shit.

53:36.964 --> 53:39.175
Hey, wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

53:45.932 --> 53:47.433
Look, uh...

53:49.310 --> 53:52.730
I, uh... I didn't mean to be such a...

53:55.149 --> 53:56.484
What I mean is...

53:58.945 --> 54:02.156
Lola, I...

54:03.991 --> 54:05.868
I'm sorry.

54:09.914 --> 54:13.542
You know, you could use some
improvement. You really could.

54:16.837 --> 54:18.673
Yeah, I know.

54:25.346 --> 54:27.640
(she sobs)

54:35.940 --> 54:39.277
Hey! I'm not the trash.

54:43.948 --> 54:46.784
OK, you're asking for it.

54:54.166 --> 54:56.002
OK. Here.

55:28.534 --> 55:32.330
- Sorry. This is by invitation only.
- This is my invitation.

55:32.496 --> 55:33.831
He)'

55:50.556 --> 55:54.226
So, the lone wolf pays us a visit.

55:55.269 --> 55:57.438
As you can see, mine's bigger.

55:57.605 --> 55:58.647
Mine's loaded.

56:00.274 --> 56:01.400
(laughs)

56:01.567 --> 56:06.447
- Tell me, Ranger, do you like games?
- I'm not here to discuss games, Falcon.

56:06.614 --> 56:08.115
- (buzzer)
- Damn!

56:08.282 --> 56:10.576
- Then what brings you?
- Guns.

56:10.743 --> 56:15.122
Guns? You know, at one time
I had a great interest in guns.

56:15.289 --> 56:19.418
- Somebody tells me you still do.
- And you would like to believe him.

56:19.585 --> 56:22.463
Two nights ago,
several men died in a convoy heist.

56:22.630 --> 56:24.673
Yes. Of course
I'm aware of these things.

56:25.132 --> 56:27.802
However the certain party
who is stealing the guns

56:27.968 --> 56:29.637
was once a close friend of mine.

56:29.804 --> 56:33.099
He might take it personally
if I were to divulge details.

56:33.265 --> 56:36.435
He is a businessman,
just like I am, and...

56:36.602 --> 56:38.979
Why am I telling you this?

56:39.146 --> 56:42.483
You will find these things out
for yourself in good time.

56:42.650 --> 56:44.985
Meanwhile I'll enjoy watching the game.

56:45.152 --> 56:47.029
It may be a game to you, Falcon.

56:47.196 --> 56:50.991
But if I find out you're playing,
I'm gonna have your little ass.

56:53.327 --> 56:55.996
Well, Ranger, it's been a pleasure
having a chat with you.

56:56.163 --> 56:58.916
But I'm afraid I must go.

57:04.130 --> 57:07.133
(Falcon) Oh, and Ranger?
The man you caught - Snow.

57:07.299 --> 57:13.347
I understand he won't live
through the night. Adios now. (cackles)

57:15.099 --> 57:19.270
<i>- You can't get through?
- I'm sorry, 6R1. I can't help you.</i>

57:19.437 --> 57:21.230
<i>That line's been reported out of order.</i>

57:22.440 --> 57:24.358
Mm-hm.

57:24.525 --> 57:27.820
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
Snow calls it. There's his 30 cents.

57:27.987 --> 57:30.114
I call it. There's my 30 cents.
What have you got, baby?

57:30.281 --> 57:35.703
- Best hand all day.
- Look at that. Pair of kings.

57:35.870 --> 57:39.248
Look at that, folks.
Three eights. Isn't that delicious?

57:39.415 --> 57:40.916
You didn't win here.

57:41.083 --> 57:45.921
I'm gonna take a little bit
of your money. How much this time?

57:46.088 --> 57:48.090
- A quarter.
- One quarter, you wish to try.

57:48.257 --> 57:49.884
25 cents.

57:50.050 --> 57:52.219
Sit still, boy!

57:52.386 --> 57:57.308
Now, you are going to love this game.
You're gonna get a marvelous hand.

57:57.475 --> 58:00.644
Unfortunately it is going
to be slightly inferior to mine,

58:00.811 --> 58:02.563
but you're going to like it.

58:02.730 --> 58:07.485
What do you got, boy? What do I hear
from you? What do I hear from you?

58:07.651 --> 58:10.446
- I need another beer.
- Oh, you need another beer.

58:10.613 --> 58:14.617
- No cards up the sleeve, huh?
- No need to, with a patsy like you.

58:14.783 --> 58:19.705
You learn when you play this game
that you really play people, not...

58:19.872 --> 58:23.083
You don't play cards, you play people.

58:24.210 --> 58:26.295
Loose lips sink ships.

58:26.462 --> 58:28.255
You understand?

58:29.298 --> 58:30.674
I thought you would.

58:30.841 --> 58:35.262
I just play the cards good and tight.

58:44.021 --> 58:44.939
Oh, fuck!

58:45.564 --> 58:48.067
(siren)

59:07.461 --> 59:09.380
(cracking)

59:15.970 --> 59:19.056
(Snow screams) No! Don't kill me!

59:27.940 --> 59:29.817
(Kayo) Dakota! You all right?

59:29.984 --> 59:34.572
Dakota! Answer me!

01:00:40.304 --> 01:00:41.305
Kayo.

01:00:50.981 --> 01:00:52.399
Kayo?

01:01:27.643 --> 01:01:29.436
It's OK, kid.

01:01:40.614 --> 01:01:41.782
Captain.

01:01:41.949 --> 01:01:45.452
Ranger, I think you know Agent Jackson.

01:01:46.578 --> 01:01:51.291
This is Colonel Remsing
and ATF Special Agent Burnside.

01:01:52.626 --> 01:01:55.254
- Feds.
- You better read this.

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:01.593
- Federal indictment?
- With your name on it.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:05.514
You're dealing with
international gun smugglers. Butchers.

01:02:05.681 --> 01:02:09.977
They provide every damn terrorist
organization in the world with our guns.

01:02:10.144 --> 01:02:12.938
I can't stand by you
on this one, Ranger.

01:02:13.105 --> 01:02:17.651
You withheld evidence, harbored a key
witness in a federal investigation,

01:02:17.818 --> 01:02:22.823
caused a good man's death and violated
every jurisdictional clause in the book.

01:02:22.990 --> 01:02:25.743
I've no choice but
to put you on probation.

01:02:25.909 --> 01:02:30.581
You'll take a mandatory vacation without
pay until this matter can be cleared up.

01:02:30.748 --> 01:02:32.166
You want my star, Captain?

01:02:32.332 --> 01:02:36.253
That won't be necessary. Not yet.

01:03:10.370 --> 01:03:12.706
Hey, Wolf. How's my boy?

01:03:25.928 --> 01:03:27.596
Jim...

01:03:40.275 --> 01:03:42.027
What's wrong?

01:03:43.821 --> 01:03:45.739
Nothing worth talking about.

01:04:12.850 --> 01:04:14.309
He)'

01:04:15.269 --> 01:04:16.770
He)'

01:04:16.937 --> 01:04:18.355
Are you OK?

01:04:21.275 --> 01:04:23.402
Yeah, I'm OK.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:13.160
(Wolf growls)

01:05:53.533 --> 01:05:55.035
Lola!

01:06:02.918 --> 01:06:05.796
- You think they got the message?
- Just like you planned.

01:06:12.302 --> 01:06:13.720
Damn.

01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:50.090
(he yells)

01:07:06.481 --> 01:07:07.899
Jim?

01:07:19.161 --> 01:07:21.204
Come on. Let's go home.

01:07:36.511 --> 01:07:37.888
I'll see you soon, honey.

01:07:39.931 --> 01:07:42.017
- Daddy, aren't you coming in?
- No, I'd better get going.

01:07:46.897 --> 01:07:48.815
I don't wanna leave you.

01:07:56.406 --> 01:07:58.700
You're becoming quite a lady, you know.

01:08:03.914 --> 01:08:05.832
I'm gonna miss you, honey.

01:08:07.584 --> 01:08:11.296
- I love you, Daddy.
- Oh, I love you too.

01:09:00.178 --> 01:09:02.848
Pretty jittery for a Ranger.

01:09:11.606 --> 01:09:15.234
- Pretty quiet for a fed.
- Oh, I make it my business.

01:09:15.402 --> 01:09:18.113
Looks like somebody
doesn't like you, McQuade.

01:09:19.781 --> 01:09:23.702
- I make a few enemies here and there.
- Yeah? So do I.

01:09:26.496 --> 01:09:29.374
- What do you want?
- I came to enlist your help.

01:09:29.541 --> 01:09:33.587
See, I'm not the token nigger
when it comes to following the rules.

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:34.587
Get to the point.

01:09:34.754 --> 01:09:37.006
(Jackson) I know they got
a drop-off point

01:09:37.174 --> 01:09:39.091
somewhere between here and Big Bend.

01:09:39.259 --> 01:09:44.764
- That's 500 square miles.
- Who knows? We might just get lucky

01:09:54.524 --> 01:09:58.320
Pretty desolate terrain, McQuade.

01:10:06.953 --> 01:10:09.080
(McQuade) There are no roads up here.

01:10:24.095 --> 01:10:26.598
- This could take weeks.
- Yeah, it's gettin' late.

01:10:26.765 --> 01:10:29.267
We'd better turn back.

01:10:43.073 --> 01:10:44.824
See somethin'?

01:10:46.368 --> 01:10:48.453
Take us down over there.

01:10:53.667 --> 01:10:55.835
There's been some activity here.

01:10:56.002 --> 01:10:58.463
Pretty well-organized for
the middle of nowhere.

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:00.882
There's nothing
indicated here on the map.

01:11:10.267 --> 01:11:11.810
What's goin' on?

01:11:11.977 --> 01:11:14.854
I've got a bad feeling
about this place.

01:11:47.887 --> 01:11:52.017
(Kayo) Well, Ranger, how does it feel
to be baby-sitting Burnside?

01:11:52.183 --> 01:11:53.435
(McQuade) Candy-ass feds.

01:12:15.248 --> 01:12:18.543
McQuade! What is this?
A damn goat trail?

01:12:18.710 --> 01:12:20.754
If you wanna turn back,
that's fine by me.

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:23.423
Who the hell does he think he is?

01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:28.094
He knows this country better than you
know the warts on your wife's backside.

01:12:28.261 --> 01:12:32.182
Why don't we all line up
and kiss his ass?

01:12:56.373 --> 01:12:59.167
- I'll be damned.
- You need some help?

01:13:01.294 --> 01:13:03.630
Let's show 'em what this baby can do.

01:13:07.008 --> 01:13:08.343
What the hell does he
think he's doin'?

01:13:09.803 --> 01:13:11.054
What the hell...?

01:13:12.055 --> 01:13:13.014
Hang on.

01:13:13.181 --> 01:13:17.727
- What's he got there? A damn tank?
- Why don't you just shut the hell up?

01:14:23.793 --> 01:14:25.336
Let's go.

01:15:29.025 --> 01:15:31.027
A real pretty setup, huh?

01:15:32.987 --> 01:15:34.614
It's been too easy.

01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:42.163
Let's check around
before we make a move.

01:15:45.250 --> 01:15:46.793
Burnside, hold it.

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.711
- This is the FBI.
- Burnside!

01:15:48.878 --> 01:15:51.631
Drop your weapons
or we'll commence firing.

01:15:51.798 --> 01:15:52.757
Get down!

01:16:07.564 --> 01:16:10.316
- Run for it. I'll cover you.
- I'm staying here.

01:16:10.483 --> 01:16:13.152
Get your ass out of here!
That's an order, Trooper!

01:16:52.233 --> 01:16:54.569
You son of a bitch!

01:17:06.539 --> 01:17:07.915
Now this is my idea of fun.

01:17:10.501 --> 01:17:12.045
Rawley, that's enough!

01:17:12.211 --> 01:17:17.800
Look, darling. I have a surprise
for you. One of your new friends.

01:17:18.885 --> 01:17:21.054
Rawley, please! Rawley!

01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:23.348
I waited a long time for this.

01:17:24.015 --> 01:17:26.225
Please don't do it this way, Rawley!

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:32.940
Very well, my dear.
Get his truck. I have a better idea.

01:17:34.317 --> 01:17:35.318
Get her out of here.

01:17:40.573 --> 01:17:44.160
You murderer! You murderer!
Let go of me!

01:17:47.372 --> 01:17:48.581
Pick him up.

01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:03.346
Put him in it.

01:18:38.965 --> 01:18:41.634
Something to remember you by.

01:18:48.933 --> 01:18:51.144
<i>Adios.</i>

01:20:25.238 --> 01:20:27.240
Freeze, assholes!

01:21:03.776 --> 01:21:05.444
Ranger!

01:21:05.611 --> 01:21:06.946
You son of a bitch!

01:21:08.739 --> 01:21:10.408
Ranger!

01:21:15.246 --> 01:21:16.622
Ranger?

01:21:18.291 --> 01:21:22.503
Don't die on me now, dammit.
Dammit, don't die on me now!

01:21:27.967 --> 01:21:29.260
Get me a beer, kid.

01:21:31.637 --> 01:21:32.805
Yes, sir!

01:21:50.615 --> 01:21:53.826
Aren't we a sorry bunch of bastards?

01:22:07.048 --> 01:22:09.550
Whose idea was this, anyway?

01:22:28.986 --> 01:22:31.030
(groans)

01:23:42.893 --> 01:23:46.814
- Oh, Jim, thank God you're here.
- What's wrong? What's wrong?

01:23:46.981 --> 01:23:51.193
It's Sally. She's missing.
I called all of her friends.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:54.822
OK, calm down, calm down, calm down.
Are you sure you checked everywhere?

01:23:59.285 --> 01:24:00.619
Oh, Jim.

01:24:03.748 --> 01:24:05.624
I'll take care of this.

01:24:07.710 --> 01:24:11.881
Is it "Ranger" or "Mr." McQuade?
May I come in, please?

01:24:12.048 --> 01:24:15.176
- Say what you came to say.
- I came to offer my assistance.

01:24:15.342 --> 01:24:21.724
A business acquaintance of mine, Rawley
Wilkes, has disappointed me greatly.

01:24:21.891 --> 01:24:26.645
I'm not interested in your problems.
I'll get him my own way, in my own time.

01:24:26.812 --> 01:24:29.982
- Wilkes has your daughter, McQuade.
- Oh, Jim! Jim!

01:24:30.149 --> 01:24:33.903
It's his way of saying
he would enjoy your company again.

01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:35.988
I want my daughter back, Falcon.

01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:43.621
Please, please. I'm more than willing
to help you retrieve your loved one,

01:24:43.788 --> 01:24:46.957
providing, of course,
that you return the favor.

01:24:47.124 --> 01:24:48.918
What's your deal?

01:24:49.085 --> 01:24:53.589
I will tell you precisely where you
can find Mr. Wilkes and your daughter.

01:24:53.756 --> 01:24:58.803
However, in return I would like
certain assets of mine protected.

01:24:58.969 --> 01:25:01.931
I wish to claim what is mine.

01:25:02.098 --> 01:25:04.600
Jim...

01:25:04.767 --> 01:25:07.103
Anything. Please.

01:25:52.231 --> 01:25:55.609
- Hey, partner. Where you headed?
- Mexico.

01:25:55.776 --> 01:25:58.737
- Mexico? What the hell for?
- They got my daughter.

01:25:58.904 --> 01:26:01.490
- Hold on. I'm comin
- It's not your fight.

01:26:05.077 --> 01:26:08.789
Hey, Ranger!
You're in no shape to do this alone!

01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:42.281
<i>Dinero, por favor. Dinero, por favor.</i>

01:26:45.367 --> 01:26:47.119
<i>Gracias. Muchas gracias.</i>

01:26:47.286 --> 01:26:50.247
<i>- gSe lo /leno, senor?
- Si.</i>

01:26:53.292 --> 01:26:56.462
Vaya con Dios. God protect you.

01:26:59.632 --> 01:27:02.551
(all murmuring)

01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:10.392
<i>Sefior?</i>

01:27:10.559 --> 01:27:12.686
They are wishing you well.

01:27:29.328 --> 01:27:31.956
You didn't think
I'd miss all the fun, did you?

01:27:57.022 --> 01:28:00.192
- A new toy, huh?
- Just a little surprise.

01:28:00.359 --> 01:28:01.986
(car approaches)

01:28:02.152 --> 01:28:03.654
You gotta be kidding.

01:28:06.282 --> 01:28:09.535
Hey. You guys remember me?

01:28:09.702 --> 01:28:12.871
How we gonna
smuggle him back to Texas?

01:28:13.038 --> 01:28:14.248
That's your problem.

01:28:40.399 --> 01:28:41.775
Can you make it?

01:28:41.942 --> 01:28:46.530
I didn't come this far
just to drop dead on the trail, did I?

01:28:46.697 --> 01:28:48.782
It's all downhill from here on.

01:29:08.385 --> 01:29:09.386
OK!

01:29:23.442 --> 01:29:25.611
We split up from here.
Stick to the plan.

01:29:25.778 --> 01:29:27.988
- Right.
- Good luck.

01:30:32.594 --> 01:30:35.973
Hello, Sally. How you doing?

01:30:37.683 --> 01:30:41.687
What does he want from me?
Why is he keeping me here?

01:30:41.854 --> 01:30:42.688
Rawley...

01:30:48.861 --> 01:30:51.530
Daddy! Daddy!

01:30:58.579 --> 01:31:00.289
Jim...

01:31:02.708 --> 01:31:05.252
I'm so happy you're alive.

01:31:19.808 --> 01:31:21.935
Where do you think
you're going, dude?

01:31:26.148 --> 01:31:27.524
Let's go.
It's gonna get rough round here.

01:31:27.691 --> 01:31:29.276
McQuade.

01:31:48.462 --> 01:31:50.547
Get that crap off.

01:32:08.106 --> 01:32:09.942
Let's get out of here.

01:32:17.866 --> 01:32:20.619
- (Sally screams)
- Sally! Sally!

01:32:23.121 --> 01:32:25.040
Remember me, greaser?

01:32:30.462 --> 01:32:33.465
Yeah. I never forget an asshole

01:32:39.930 --> 01:32:41.306
Stay here.

01:33:17.175 --> 01:33:19.177
Oh, shit.

01:33:19.344 --> 01:33:21.054
Dammit.

01:33:46.955 --> 01:33:48.165
Agh!

01:33:52.002 --> 01:33:53.420
Come on. Come on.

01:34:21.073 --> 01:34:23.784
Damn! I knew I forgot something.

01:34:48.266 --> 01:34:50.227
(clang)

01:35:22.509 --> 01:35:25.470
Welcome to my hacienda, Mr. McQuade.

01:35:28.265 --> 01:35:30.851
How nice of you to pay a social visit.

01:36:24.863 --> 01:36:25.739
Daddy!

01:37:21.628 --> 01:37:22.462
Daddy!

01:37:24.923 --> 01:37:25.924
Come on.

01:37:28.176 --> 01:37:30.095
- Daddy!
- No! Sally! Sally!

01:37:30.262 --> 01:37:32.264
No! Stop it!

01:37:42.983 --> 01:37:44.985
(yells)

01:37:48.321 --> 01:37:50.740
Sally! Sally...

01:38:51.301 --> 01:38:53.762
Are you all right, honey?

01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:01.478
Gimme that gun.

01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:06.399
- McQuade!
- Rawley! No!

01:39:17.202 --> 01:39:19.287
Come on.

01:39:24.501 --> 01:39:26.628
Jim...

01:39:26.795 --> 01:39:29.047
I didn't betray you.

01:39:32.759 --> 01:39:38.098
Rawley killed my husband
and forced me to be his partner.

01:39:38.264 --> 01:39:42.560
I had no choice.
He would have killed me.

01:39:51.361 --> 01:39:53.071
I love you.

01:40:12.841 --> 01:40:14.134
Hey, McQuade!

01:40:49.502 --> 01:40:51.171
Daddy...

01:41:14.319 --> 01:41:18.156
My arsenal! My investments!
What have you done?

01:41:18.323 --> 01:41:22.118
Don't move, don't talk,
and everything will be just fine.

01:41:22.285 --> 01:41:25.914
We made a deal, McQuade.

01:41:26.081 --> 01:41:28.958
You made the deal, shorty. Not me.

01:41:30.835 --> 01:41:33.004
You wanna try for three?

01:41:37.801 --> 01:41:40.637
McQuade, wait. Wait!

01:41:40.804 --> 01:41:43.848
You can't leave me here.
What about the Federales?

01:41:44.015 --> 01:41:48.895
- You know how to fly this thing?
- I sure as hell don't. But he does.

01:41:51.564 --> 01:41:54.484
You can't leave me! McQuade!

01:41:54.651 --> 01:41:56.027
McQuade!

01:41:56.194 --> 01:41:58.196
Wait! McQuade!

01:41:58.363 --> 01:42:01.866
That's my chopper!
McQuade, come back here!

01:42:02.033 --> 01:42:05.578
McQuade! That's my chopper! McQuade!

01:42:18.508 --> 01:42:21.302
Can we print the comment that you made
about your daring rescue?

01:42:23.221 --> 01:42:25.974
And the FBI credits
the Texas Rangers with the rescue?

01:42:26.141 --> 01:42:28.726
- Absolutely correct.
- Can I have another picture?

01:42:28.893 --> 01:42:31.813
Why not?
Ranger, you feel up to a picture?

01:42:35.400 --> 01:42:40.613
Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna say it's
a pleasure having this man on my team.

01:42:40.780 --> 01:42:42.991
I feel responsible
for every move he's made.

01:42:43.158 --> 01:42:45.201
After all, I taught him all he knows.

01:42:45.368 --> 01:42:47.453
- He has style.
- Bullshit.

01:42:47.620 --> 01:42:48.913
The best always have style.

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:51.207
Daddy!

01:42:51.374 --> 01:42:53.418
- Dad!
- That's my girl.

01:42:55.253 --> 01:42:58.089
I can't wait to show you our new house.
Come on, let's go.

01:42:58.256 --> 01:43:00.091
- Hi, Jim.
- Hi, Molly.

01:43:00.258 --> 01:43:03.928
Gimme a hug. I really
appreciate your helping us move.

01:43:04.095 --> 01:43:06.890
- My pleasure.
- Come on, let's go.

01:43:11.811 --> 01:43:14.272
Oh, boy. Here we go.

01:43:14.439 --> 01:43:17.275
(siren)

01:43:22.530 --> 01:43:25.742
Ranger, we got a 10-31 in progress
at the Texas National Bank.

01:43:25.909 --> 01:43:29.579
- I'm on vacation.
- They've got hostages.

01:43:29.746 --> 01:43:33.291
- We really need you, Ranger.
- Comin', Jim?

01:43:34.375 --> 01:43:37.003
Daddy?

01:43:41.007 --> 01:43:41.925
Hostages?

01:43:48.139 --> 01:43:49.474
Daddy?

01:43:49.641 --> 01:43:50.558
Are you comin'?

01:43:54.479 --> 01:43:57.982
See you later. Let's go.

01:43:58.149 --> 01:44:01.027
J.J. McQuade, you'll never change!

01:44:06.824 --> 01:44:09.244
Oh, hell.
