02:12.164 --> 02:13.654
Let's talk business.

02:14.967 --> 02:18.300
This fat bastard is moving in
on Morizio's business.

02:18.371 --> 02:20.566
You know Morizio is a reasonable guy.

02:20.640 --> 02:24.940
He just wants a little conversation.

02:25.011 --> 02:27.775
But this guy, he don't wanna hear about it.

02:27.847 --> 02:29.747
Maybe he'll listen to you.

02:29.815 --> 02:33.808
He comes to town every Tuesday.
Are you free Tuesday?

02:35.855 --> 02:37.846
Yeah, I'm free Tuesday.

02:54.240 --> 02:56.674
Nice to see you again,
Mr. Jones.

03:10.756 --> 03:12.781
Remember, neatness counts.

03:12.858 --> 03:15.292
You got one half hour.

03:22.702 --> 03:25.193
One hour.

03:36.182 --> 03:37.615
What?

03:37.683 --> 03:42.848
It's Tonto, downstairs.
There's a guy wants to talk to you.

03:44.790 --> 03:46.223
What's he look like?

03:48.694 --> 03:50.855
Serious.

03:50.930 --> 03:53.956
- Tell him I'm coming up.
- He's coming up.

03:56.235 --> 04:00.137
Somebody's coming up.
Somebody serious.

04:04.610 --> 04:07.875
Mickey, open your eyes.
We got company.

04:10.382 --> 04:12.213
We got company.

04:24.663 --> 04:26.096
Come on.

04:34.840 --> 04:36.273
Stop, man!

04:46.852 --> 04:49.787
Tell the driver to wait for us
out back, and hurry up.

05:36.902 --> 05:39.996
- Sweetie, what's going on?
- Don't worry, baby.

05:40.072 --> 05:42.165
It's cool. Take a nap.

06:00.426 --> 06:02.826
Oh, my God.

06:02.895 --> 06:05.056
Those fuckers blocked both the exits.

06:09.268 --> 06:10.701
Check the terrace!

07:24.243 --> 07:26.939
<i>- 911 emergency.
- I need help.</i>

07:27.012 --> 07:29.412
<i>- Somebody's trying to kill me.
- Just stay on the line.</i>

07:29.481 --> 07:32.109
<i>I'll just be off a moment.</i>

07:32.184 --> 07:34.618
<i>I'm gonna connect you
with an officer.</i>

07:52.771 --> 07:56.104
<i>Detective Jefferson.
May I help you?</i>

07:56.175 --> 07:58.143
I'll call you back.

08:01.814 --> 08:06.478
Relax, man. I got half of Bolivia
sitting in them suitcases.

08:06.552 --> 08:10.318
Hasn't even been cut yet.
Go ahead, take it. It's yours.

08:14.693 --> 08:17.127
Dial this number.

08:29.908 --> 08:32.967
I'll talk to you later, sweetie, okay?

08:34.179 --> 08:36.044
Bye.

08:39.885 --> 08:42.854
<i>- Hello?
- It's Morizio. Remember me?</i>

08:42.921 --> 08:47.517
<i>- I see you're back in town.
- Yeah. I mean, no.</i>

08:47.593 --> 08:49.527
Just for today.

08:49.595 --> 08:52.359
<i>So it's safe to say
today's your last day in town...</i>

08:52.431 --> 08:55.195
<i>and we'll never see
your fat fucking face again.</i>

08:55.267 --> 08:57.861
Yeah. Right.

08:57.936 --> 09:00.700
<i>Let me speak
to our mutual friend.</i>

09:02.608 --> 09:04.769
He wants to talk to you.

09:10.115 --> 09:14.211
<i>Make sure he understands,
and let him go.</i>

09:22.628 --> 09:26.564
Do you understand?

09:26.632 --> 09:29.260
- So say it.
- I understand.

09:31.303 --> 09:32.736
Good.

09:58.831 --> 10:00.264
Jesus.

10:11.176 --> 10:12.768
Two milk as usual?

11:22.748 --> 11:24.409
Why did you hide the cigarette?

11:26.118 --> 11:28.279
This building's full of rats.

11:28.353 --> 11:32.653
I didn't want my old man to find out.
Got enough problems.

11:41.600 --> 11:43.067
What happened?

11:44.636 --> 11:47.696
I fell off my bike.

11:59.785 --> 12:03.186
Don't tell my dad about the cigarette, okay?

12:14.299 --> 12:18.133
- Why are you doing this to us?
- I don't know...

12:18.203 --> 12:21.468
People got memory problems these days.
It must be the sun.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.906
- Know when to come out of the sun.
- I don't know how it happened.

12:23.976 --> 12:26.001
What's my job? I'm just a holder.

12:26.078 --> 12:28.911
I hold the stuff you give to me.
I don't look at it or touch it.

12:28.981 --> 12:31.074
- I don't know how to cut it.
- Try to follow me.

12:31.149 --> 12:33.743
In June, we gave you the dope.
It tests 100 percent pure.

12:33.819 --> 12:37.414
Now it's July, we pick up the dope,
and it tests 90 percent pure.

12:37.489 --> 12:41.016
Somewhere between June and July,
ten percent turned to cut!

12:41.093 --> 12:44.358
I don't know. It's none of my business.
You give me the stuff, I hold it.

12:44.429 --> 12:47.921
- That's all I know.
- I'm trying to help you out here...

12:48.000 --> 12:50.662
but if you're gonna be
a hard-ass about it...

12:50.736 --> 12:53.102
I gotta disturb him.

12:53.171 --> 12:58.438
When he's into his music,
he hates being disturbed.

12:58.510 --> 13:00.774
I'm telling you the truth.

13:00.846 --> 13:05.112
I hope so, because he's got a talent
for sniffin' out a lie.

13:05.183 --> 13:07.014
It's scary.

13:07.085 --> 13:10.179
It's almost like a sixth sense.

13:10.255 --> 13:14.123
Are you gonna change your tune
or I gotta bust into his?

13:16.428 --> 13:18.794
I'm telling you the truth.

13:26.371 --> 13:27.804
All right.

13:30.509 --> 13:32.136
Stan.

13:35.547 --> 13:39.176
I'm sorry.
He said he didn't cut the dope.

14:20.425 --> 14:22.552
Of course he didn't.

14:31.937 --> 14:33.700
Just do me a favor.

14:33.772 --> 14:36.468
Find out who did by tomorrow.

14:36.541 --> 14:38.372
Noon.

14:49.955 --> 14:52.549
Malky, wait.

14:52.624 --> 14:55.650
I didn't cut your shit.

14:55.727 --> 14:58.161
Find out yourself!

15:01.633 --> 15:04.568
What are you doin' out here?
Get inside and do your homework.

15:04.636 --> 15:07.298
- I did it already.
- Get inside and help your sister...

15:07.372 --> 15:08.896
clean up the goddamn house!

15:08.974 --> 15:11.067
And stop smoking cigarettes!

17:00.752 --> 17:01.980
<i>One!</i>

17:03.421 --> 17:05.480
<i>Two. Take a deep breath in.</i>

17:05.557 --> 17:07.616
<i>Take a deep breath out.</i>

17:07.692 --> 17:11.788
<i>- Take a deep breath. Inhale.
- Time's up. My turn.</i>

17:11.863 --> 17:14.593
Change the channel, and I'll smash your face.

17:14.665 --> 17:17.066
<i>Ready for the legs.
And down.</i>

17:28.747 --> 17:30.806
Sorry, sweetheart.

17:30.882 --> 17:32.713
<i>Squeeze. Release.</i>

17:32.784 --> 17:35.048
Good morning.

17:35.120 --> 17:37.179
Hi, honey.

17:38.924 --> 17:42.690
Sweetheart, turn that down.
Mama's got a headache.

17:42.761 --> 17:45.992
- She took my turn.
- She wants to watch goddamn cartoons!

17:46.064 --> 17:47.998
It wouldn't hurt her to move her ass.

17:48.066 --> 17:50.057
I'm not the one with a fat ass around here.

17:50.135 --> 17:52.399
<i>Two and up.</i>

17:52.470 --> 17:54.904
Can someone who's doing nothing
all day but watching cartoons...

17:54.973 --> 17:57.567
move a little ass and go get some food?

17:57.642 --> 18:02.136
<i>- Legs. Beautiful.
- I dare you to say that again.</i>

18:06.885 --> 18:10.582
- Margie, I think I screwed up.
- It wouldn't be the first time.

18:10.655 --> 18:14.091
You always come up with somethin', right?

18:14.159 --> 18:16.423
I think I went too far this time.

18:16.494 --> 18:19.930
You're goin' too far right now.
I'm gonna be late for work.

18:19.998 --> 18:22.432
How about workin' at home today?

18:24.235 --> 18:28.262
<i>Really feel it.
That's it, stomach in.</i>

18:28.340 --> 18:31.935
<i>- One...
- Now it's my turn!</i>

18:32.010 --> 18:34.570
Shit!
She's gonna hit me!

18:34.646 --> 18:37.080
- Daddy, she's...
- Shit! Shut the goddamn door!

18:38.617 --> 18:40.414
<i>Please don't shoot!</i>

18:42.320 --> 18:44.754
Fuckin' bitch.

18:44.823 --> 18:49.624
<i>- Megatron!
- Firm up the whole body.</i>

18:49.694 --> 18:53.755
<i>When you use the Quadra-Step,
your thigh muscles...</i>

18:53.832 --> 18:56.824
- Can somebody answer the phone?
- I'm busy!

19:03.375 --> 19:05.809
<i>- Hello?
- This is Marguerite McCallister...</i>

19:05.877 --> 19:10.371
<i>headmistress at the Spencer School
in Wildwood, New Jersey.</i>

19:10.448 --> 19:13.144
<i>Is Mr. or Mrs. Lando home?</i>

19:16.054 --> 19:18.113
This is she.

19:18.189 --> 19:21.488
<i>Mrs. Lando, when your husband
enrolled Mathilda at Spencer...</i>

19:21.559 --> 19:23.823
<i>he told us she had "problems."</i>

19:23.895 --> 19:26.489
<i>As you know, we pride ourselves
on turning troubled girls...</i>

19:26.564 --> 19:28.657
<i>into healthy,
productive young women.</i>

19:28.733 --> 19:31.668
<i>But if they are not here,
there is very little we can do.</i>

19:31.736 --> 19:35.001
<i>Mathilda left school
without permission nearly two weeks ago.</i>

19:35.073 --> 19:38.008
<i>I know your husband paid tuition
in advance for a year...</i>

19:38.076 --> 19:42.172
<i>but if you will refer to the rules
and regulations manual we sent you...</i>

19:42.247 --> 19:46.183
<i>you will see that unless there is
a valid excuse for prolonged absence...</i>

19:46.251 --> 19:49.186
<i>your tuition will be forfeit.</i>

19:49.254 --> 19:51.779
She's dead.

20:11.776 --> 20:15.712
Tell that fuckin' kid to do
a little work around here!

20:15.780 --> 20:20.046
Clean up!
I'm tired of this fuckin' mess.

20:20.118 --> 20:21.551
Hurry up!

20:34.966 --> 20:37.161
<i>Why am I feeling</i>

20:37.235 --> 20:39.169
<i>When things could look black</i>

20:39.237 --> 20:43.537
<i>That nothing could possibly go wrong</i>

20:44.609 --> 20:49.569
<i>This has been a most unusual day</i>

20:50.749 --> 20:53.843
<i>Love has made me see things</i>

20:53.918 --> 20:59.754
<i>In a different way</i>

21:27.352 --> 21:31.584
Is life always this hard,
or is it just when you're a kid?

21:35.026 --> 21:36.960
Always like this.

21:43.701 --> 21:45.134
Keep it.

21:53.211 --> 21:57.045
I'm going grocery shopping.
You want some milk?

21:57.115 --> 22:00.050
One quart or two?
It's two, right?

23:43.221 --> 23:47.521
I like these calm little moments
before the storm.

23:48.860 --> 23:51.124
It reminds me of Beethoven.

23:56.534 --> 23:59.697
Can you hear it?

23:59.771 --> 24:03.639
It's like when you put your head to the grass...

24:03.708 --> 24:05.903
you can hear it growin'.

24:05.977 --> 24:08.741
You can hear the insects.

24:14.385 --> 24:17.377
- Do you like Beethoven?
- Couldn't really say.

24:17.455 --> 24:19.423
I'm gonna play you some.

24:23.394 --> 24:24.827
Daddy!

24:36.307 --> 24:38.241
You better stay here.

25:20.018 --> 25:21.952
We said noon.

25:25.490 --> 25:27.424
I've got one minute past.

25:31.362 --> 25:33.489
You don't like Beethoven.

25:35.066 --> 25:36.931
You don't know what you're missing.

25:37.001 --> 25:41.495
Overtures like that get my juices flowing.

25:41.572 --> 25:44.166
So powerful.

25:44.242 --> 25:48.406
But after his openings, to be honest...

25:48.479 --> 25:52.575
he does tend to get a little fucking boring.

25:54.752 --> 25:56.879
That's why I stopped!

26:01.192 --> 26:03.524
Toss the apartment.

26:24.215 --> 26:27.981
You're a Mozart fan.
I love him too.

26:28.052 --> 26:31.044
I love Mozart!

26:36.194 --> 26:38.628
He was Austrian, you know.

26:38.696 --> 26:42.462
But for this kind of work,
he's a little bit light.

26:42.533 --> 26:45.559
So I tend to go for the heavier guys.

26:45.636 --> 26:49.231
- Cool.
- Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

26:49.307 --> 26:52.071
<i>Man,
keep your bombacut mouth shut.</i>

26:52.143 --> 26:56.011
Check out Brahms.
He's good too.

26:56.080 --> 26:58.640
- What the fuck do you know about music?
- Man, knock it off!

27:13.498 --> 27:16.331
- You check the mattress?
- Nope.

27:58.309 --> 27:59.742
Wow.

28:19.530 --> 28:22.260
Oh! Fuck!

28:22.333 --> 28:24.665
He's dead.

28:24.735 --> 28:29.001
Jesus. Look what you did.

28:29.073 --> 28:31.007
Stan, you all right?

28:51.429 --> 28:53.363
What are you doin'?

28:53.431 --> 28:57.527
- He's dead!
- But he ruined my suit.

28:57.602 --> 29:00.093
Yeah, I know, but he's dead.

29:00.171 --> 29:03.538
He's a piece of meat.
Forget about it. Calm down.

29:03.608 --> 29:05.132
I'm calm.

29:05.209 --> 29:07.439
Stay there, all right?

29:10.781 --> 29:13.249
Benny!

29:16.087 --> 29:21.081
Jesus fuckin' Christ, Benny!
It's Malky and Stan!

29:22.627 --> 29:24.754
Take it easy, all right?

29:24.829 --> 29:26.626
Come on.

29:30.434 --> 29:32.402
Come on, let's get a cigarette.

29:32.470 --> 29:34.961
Benny, we're comin' out!

29:35.039 --> 29:37.837
Benny, don't fire!

29:37.908 --> 29:40.706
Get in there!

29:40.778 --> 29:43.178
Jesus fuckin' Christ, Benny!

29:43.247 --> 29:46.876
You wear somethin' new and...
Got a light?

29:46.951 --> 29:48.919
Take it easy.

29:50.154 --> 29:52.088
What's happening out there?

29:52.156 --> 29:54.021
It's all right, ma'am.
D.E.A. Police.

29:54.091 --> 29:57.288
Leave that poor family alone.

29:57.361 --> 30:00.990
- Everything's all right. Just calm down.
- I am calm. I'm calm.

30:01.065 --> 30:03.295
Why don't you leave them alone?

30:04.702 --> 30:07.796
He said go back inside.

30:12.576 --> 30:15.340
Stan, I think it's better if we go inside.

30:32.963 --> 30:38.333
Benny, turn that kitchen upside down!
Find that shit!

30:38.402 --> 30:42.065
Willy Blood, look what you did!
You killed a 4-year-old kid!

30:42.139 --> 30:44.073
Did you really have to do that?

30:59.890 --> 31:02.586
Please open the door.

31:58.682 --> 32:02.209
Benny, there are three kids here.

32:02.286 --> 32:04.618
I think Stan killed this girl.

32:04.688 --> 32:07.248
Willy, that asshole, shot the little boy.

32:07.324 --> 32:09.849
The third one's missing.
Find her.

32:19.069 --> 32:21.765
Shit. We missed
the little girl, man.

32:21.839 --> 32:25.434
I'm gonna find the fuckin' super
in this goddamn building.

32:51.001 --> 32:56.268
<i>- Don't you recognize me?
- Me, Grimlock. Know you!</i>

33:06.383 --> 33:07.816
Shit.

33:09.153 --> 33:13.146
- Yo! I found it!
- Bingo!

33:13.224 --> 33:16.318
- They found it.
- I know.

33:16.393 --> 33:18.327
There it is.

33:19.396 --> 33:21.330
There's cops outside.
We better go.

33:21.398 --> 33:24.834
It's the cops outside.
We better go. You stay here.

33:26.904 --> 33:28.371
What do I say?

33:40.584 --> 33:42.347
Tell them...

33:42.419 --> 33:46.685
we were doing our job.

33:56.367 --> 34:00.326
- What's your name?
- Mathilda.

34:05.943 --> 34:08.467
- Sorry about your father.
- If somebody didn't do it...

34:08.545 --> 34:11.572
one day or another,
I would have probably done it myself.

34:13.617 --> 34:15.050
Your mother, she...

34:15.119 --> 34:16.882
She's not my mother.

34:16.954 --> 34:22.483
My sister wanted to lose some weight.
Bet she never looked better.

34:22.560 --> 34:25.460
She's not even my real sister.
Just a half sister.

34:25.529 --> 34:27.895
Not a good half at that.

34:38.275 --> 34:40.208
If you couldn't stand them, why are you crying?

34:40.277 --> 34:43.246
They killed my brother.

34:43.313 --> 34:47.545
What the hell did he do?
He was four years old.

34:47.618 --> 34:49.552
He never used to cry.

34:49.620 --> 34:53.647
He just used to sit next to me and cuddle.

34:53.724 --> 34:58.627
I was more of a mother to him
than that goddamned pig ever was.

34:58.696 --> 35:03.099
Don't talk like that about pigs.
They're usually nicer than people.

35:03.167 --> 35:05.397
But they smell like shit.

35:07.338 --> 35:08.771
Not true.

35:08.839 --> 35:13.435
As a matter of fact,
right now I have one in my kitchen...

35:13.510 --> 35:15.410
that's very clean...

35:15.479 --> 35:19.609
- and smells very nice.
- You don't have a pig in your kitchen.

35:21.685 --> 35:23.118
Yes, I do.

35:23.187 --> 35:26.350
I was just in there,
and I didn't see any goddamned pig.

35:26.423 --> 35:29.859
Don't move.
I'll get him.

35:31.829 --> 35:33.763
Piggy, where are you?

35:35.366 --> 35:37.300
There you are.

35:44.375 --> 35:47.310
Hi, Mathilda.

35:47.378 --> 35:50.040
Hi, piggy.

35:57.521 --> 36:00.752
How are you today?

36:00.824 --> 36:03.384
I've seen better days.

36:10.501 --> 36:15.336
- What's your name?
- Leon.

36:17.708 --> 36:19.801
Cute name.

36:26.784 --> 36:30.880
You have anyone to go to,
any family anyplace else?

36:42.032 --> 36:44.466
I'm gonna get some more milk.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.587
Holy shit.

37:10.627 --> 37:14.563
Don't touch that, please.

37:14.631 --> 37:17.031
What do you do for a living?

37:18.102 --> 37:19.569
Cleaner.

37:20.971 --> 37:22.905
You're a hit man?

37:26.577 --> 37:28.044
Cool.

37:40.624 --> 37:45.084
- Do you clean anyone?
- No women, no kids. That's the rules.

37:45.162 --> 37:48.222
How much would it cost to hire someone
to get those dirtbags...

37:48.298 --> 37:51.096
who killed my brother?

37:51.168 --> 37:54.934
- Five grand a head.
- Wow.

37:55.005 --> 37:59.101
How about I work for you...

37:59.176 --> 38:02.668
and in exchange, you teach me how to clean?

38:02.746 --> 38:05.840
What do you think?

38:05.916 --> 38:07.941
I'll clean your place.
I'll do the shopping.

38:08.018 --> 38:10.248
I'll even wash your clothes.

38:11.522 --> 38:15.856
- Is it a deal?
- No, it's not a deal.

38:23.367 --> 38:28.202
What do you want me to do?
I've got no place to go.

38:28.272 --> 38:32.106
You've had a rough day today.

38:35.045 --> 38:37.536
Go to sleep, and we'll see tomorrow.

38:51.995 --> 38:55.123
You've been really great with me, Leon...

38:55.199 --> 38:58.225
and it's not always like that.

38:58.302 --> 39:00.167
You know?

39:07.878 --> 39:09.311
Good night.

40:25.689 --> 40:27.953
You sleep well?

40:28.025 --> 40:30.357
Good.

40:30.427 --> 40:32.861
- After breakfast you gotta take off.
- Where to?

40:32.930 --> 40:35.592
Not my problem.

40:49.947 --> 40:51.414
Read it.

40:58.288 --> 41:00.313
You don't know how to read.

41:00.390 --> 41:03.382
I'm learning, but I've had
a lot of work lately...

41:03.460 --> 41:06.520
so I'm a little behind.

41:06.596 --> 41:08.063
What's it say?

41:08.131 --> 41:12.192
I've decided what to do with my life.
I wanna be a cleaner.

41:12.269 --> 41:16.729
You wanna be a cleaner.
Here.

41:16.807 --> 41:21.574
Take it. It's a good-bye gift.
Go clean, but not with me.

41:21.645 --> 41:25.240
- I work alone. Understand?
- Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone.

41:25.315 --> 41:28.307
Thelma and Louise didn't work alone.
They were the best.

41:30.487 --> 41:34.583
Mathilda, why are you doing this to me?

41:34.658 --> 41:37.320
I've been nothing but nice to you.

41:37.394 --> 41:40.261
I saved your life yesterday,
right outside the door.

41:40.330 --> 41:43.595
Right.
Now you're responsible for it.

41:43.667 --> 41:47.103
If you saved my life,
you must've saved it for a good reason.

41:47.170 --> 41:49.934
If you throw me out now,
it's like you never opened your door...

41:50.007 --> 41:52.840
like you let me die right there in front of it.

41:52.909 --> 41:58.313
But you did open it. So...

42:01.585 --> 42:05.954
If you don't help me,
I'll die tonight. I can feel it.

42:06.023 --> 42:08.287
I don't wanna die tonight.

42:10.827 --> 42:13.295
You're just a little girl.

42:13.363 --> 42:16.298
Don't take it badly,
but I don't think you could do it.

42:16.366 --> 42:17.799
I'm sorry.

42:36.553 --> 42:38.487
How's that?

43:12.422 --> 43:15.516
Don't you ever do that again
or I'll break your head.

43:15.592 --> 43:17.025
You got that?

43:18.261 --> 43:21.697
I don't work like that.
It's not professional.

43:21.765 --> 43:23.699
There is rules.

43:24.768 --> 43:27.532
And stop saying "okay" all the time!

43:30.607 --> 43:32.199
Good.

43:47.457 --> 43:49.687
You expect to use that in this hotel?

43:51.661 --> 43:54.721
Mister, I have to use it...

43:54.798 --> 43:58.894
because I have an audition
at Juilliard next month...

43:58.969 --> 44:01.199
and I have to practice.

44:01.271 --> 44:05.139
Okay, but not after 10:00.

44:05.208 --> 44:07.267
- I promise.
- All right.

44:09.279 --> 44:12.248
I'll put you at the end of the hall...

44:12.315 --> 44:16.411
so that you don't disturb anyone.

44:16.486 --> 44:17.976
Fill those out, please.

44:22.159 --> 44:27.153
Daddy, can I please fill them out?
I like to check in to hotels.

44:30.700 --> 44:32.895
Thanks, Pop.
I'll bring these back in a minute.

44:32.969 --> 44:35.233
Fourth floor!

44:35.305 --> 44:36.897
Thanks, mister!

44:36.973 --> 44:40.067
You're lucky to have a little girl
that's interested in things.

44:42.445 --> 44:45.903
I have a kid, 17, does nothing all day long.

44:51.521 --> 44:54.581
Can I leave my plant here
while I take my stuff upstairs?

44:54.658 --> 44:56.455
Of course.

45:17.380 --> 45:20.645
I'm putting in a name of a girl
in my class who makes me sick.

45:23.186 --> 45:26.713
If things get hot, she'll take the heat.

45:43.707 --> 45:46.335
There. Finished.

45:46.876 --> 45:49.868
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

45:50.714 --> 45:53.706
- Eighteen?
- Want to see my license?

45:54.751 --> 45:59.017
No. You just look a little young.

45:59.789 --> 46:01.450
Thanks.

46:08.665 --> 46:12.226
Leon, I want you to teach me how to be like you.

46:12.302 --> 46:14.566
I want to be strong and smart like you.

46:16.339 --> 46:19.172
I know I'm not strong enough yet...

46:19.242 --> 46:23.303
but I could learn the basics, the theory.

46:23.380 --> 46:27.510
What do you think?
Just the theory.

46:27.584 --> 46:29.848
I need this, Leon.

46:31.588 --> 46:33.681
I need time to get my head together.

46:33.757 --> 46:36.521
Yeah, and I need...

46:42.265 --> 46:43.789
a drink.

46:43.867 --> 46:46.859
Don't move.
I'll go get one.

47:11.961 --> 47:15.397
When you told me to get this baby out for you...

47:15.465 --> 47:17.729
I thought my hearin' was goin'.

47:17.801 --> 47:22.704
I says to myself, "Leon's a pro.
Nobody uses that except beginners."

47:22.772 --> 47:24.535
I like to stay in shape.

47:24.607 --> 47:29.067
Sure.
Always stay on top of it.

47:29.145 --> 47:32.842
It's like me. I gotta know
where everything is all the time.

47:32.916 --> 47:35.476
I never leave this place,
except to go from here to there.

47:38.888 --> 47:41.880
Change ain't good, Leon.
You know?

47:52.836 --> 47:54.269
Check it.

47:55.839 --> 47:58.501
- Make sure it's the right thing.
- I trust you.

47:58.575 --> 48:01.601
One thing's got nothin' to do
with the other. Remember that.

48:03.012 --> 48:04.946
I will.

48:19.996 --> 48:22.965
The rifle is the first weapon
you learn how to use...

48:23.032 --> 48:26.866
because it lets you
keep your distance from the client.

48:26.936 --> 48:29.166
The closer you get to being a pro...

48:29.239 --> 48:32.436
the closer you can get to the client.

48:32.509 --> 48:36.036
The knife, for example,
is the last thing you learn.

48:41.718 --> 48:43.151
Position.

49:07.310 --> 49:11.144
Never take it off until the last minute.
It reflects light.

49:11.214 --> 49:14.012
They can see you coming from a mile away.

49:14.083 --> 49:17.814
And always dress down.

49:17.887 --> 49:21.015
Never brighter than the floor, okay?

49:23.893 --> 49:28.523
Let's practice now.
It's the best way to learn.

49:28.598 --> 49:30.691
Who should I hit?

49:30.767 --> 49:32.359
Whoever.

49:39.275 --> 49:41.539
I'll be with you in a second.
Give me a few minutes. Thank you.

49:41.611 --> 49:44.375
You guys get lost.
I don't want to see you.

49:44.447 --> 49:47.905
- Is everyone in position?
- This has to look natural.

49:57.460 --> 50:00.896
- No women, no kids. Right?
- Right.

50:08.171 --> 50:10.571
Jogger in the yellow and orange?

50:15.144 --> 50:17.544
Keep calm.

50:20.817 --> 50:24.378
Don't take your eyes off him.

50:24.454 --> 50:26.251
Breathe easy.

50:27.991 --> 50:29.618
Watch his movement.

50:32.161 --> 50:34.595
Pretend you're running with him.

50:37.634 --> 50:40.762
Try to feel his next movement.

50:42.338 --> 50:45.671
Take a deep breath.
Hold it.

50:54.250 --> 50:55.717
Now.

50:55.785 --> 50:57.616
Oh, my God!

50:57.687 --> 51:01.384
- I'm all right. I'm fine.
- Get down! Where'd that come from?

51:01.457 --> 51:05.223
One shot. Not bad, huh?

51:05.295 --> 51:07.729
- Who the hell fired?
- I just can't breathe! Get off me.

51:07.797 --> 51:11.460
Can we try with real bullets now?

51:11.534 --> 51:13.502
Not today.
Let's pack up.

51:22.879 --> 51:24.312
Like that.

52:06.689 --> 52:10.022
- No, thanks.
- No discussion.

52:51.768 --> 52:53.736
"It seemed...

52:55.138 --> 52:57.072
to Socrates..."

53:04.881 --> 53:06.815
I'll do it.

53:20.830 --> 53:23.321
Leon, all we do is work.

53:23.399 --> 53:26.527
We need a break.
Let's play a game.

53:26.602 --> 53:30.265
- What kind of game?
- I have this great game.

53:30.339 --> 53:34.139
It makes you think and helps your
memory. It's exactly what you need.

53:47.523 --> 53:49.115
<i>Like a virgin</i>

53:50.993 --> 53:54.292
<i>Touched for the very first time</i>

53:58.768 --> 54:01.828
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

54:12.014 --> 54:17.782
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

54:17.854 --> 54:22.154
<i>Happy birthday, Mr. President</i>

54:22.225 --> 54:24.659
I don't know.

54:33.469 --> 54:35.300
Moustache.

54:39.308 --> 54:42.835
<i>I'm singing in the rain</i>

54:42.912 --> 54:45.506
<i>Just singing in the rain</i>

54:45.581 --> 54:48.141
<i>- What a beaut...
- Gene Kelly?</i>

54:49.752 --> 54:51.185
Good.

54:51.254 --> 54:54.087
Your turn now.

54:59.595 --> 55:01.358
Okay, pilgrim.

55:04.767 --> 55:06.234
Clint Eastwood?

55:13.109 --> 55:18.206
- I don't know. I give up.
- John Wayne.

55:18.281 --> 55:22.274
I was just about to say that.
I swear. It's amazing.

55:22.351 --> 55:24.717
Leon, really brilliant.

55:27.123 --> 55:29.057
Amazing.

55:43.973 --> 55:48.239
- You love your plant, don't you?
- It's my best friend.

55:48.311 --> 55:51.906
Always happy.
No questions.

55:53.482 --> 55:56.576
It's like me, you see.

55:56.652 --> 55:58.813
No roots.

55:58.888 --> 56:02.654
If you really love it, you should
plant it in a park so it can have roots.

56:06.729 --> 56:09.391
You should be watering me
if you want me to grow.

56:11.634 --> 56:13.067
You're right.

56:24.513 --> 56:25.946
Wait!

56:40.763 --> 56:45.359
They gotta be jumping out of the plate.
They gotta be alive.

56:53.442 --> 56:55.808
It's been a long time, Leon.

57:01.717 --> 57:03.685
I missed you.

57:03.753 --> 57:08.588
- And you missed some nice jobs too.
- Been training.

57:08.658 --> 57:12.651
Training's good, but don't overdo it.

57:12.728 --> 57:15.128
Training don't pay as good as working, Leon.

57:15.197 --> 57:16.664
Tony...

57:19.568 --> 57:24.198
all the money I make, that you keep for me...

57:24.273 --> 57:26.264
You need some money?

57:26.342 --> 57:27.900
Just curious.

57:27.977 --> 57:29.911
I've been working a long time...

57:29.979 --> 57:33.676
and I haven't done anything with my money.

57:35.785 --> 57:41.587
I thought maybe someday I could use it.

57:41.657 --> 57:44.023
You met a woman.

57:53.602 --> 57:55.695
You gotta be careful with women.

57:55.771 --> 57:58.740
Remember when you arrived in this country?

57:58.808 --> 58:03.211
When I took you in, you were still wet
behind the fuckin' ears...

58:03.279 --> 58:06.214
and, already, you were in deep shit
because of a woman.

58:06.282 --> 58:11.185
- Don't forget that, Leon.
- I wish I could sometimes.

58:13.789 --> 58:16.087
You know, about my money...

58:16.158 --> 58:20.561
Maybe I could give...

58:20.629 --> 58:22.722
a little...

58:24.266 --> 58:26.564
to someone.

58:26.635 --> 58:29.729
You know, to help out.

58:32.274 --> 58:36.301
It's your money. I'm just
holding it for you, like a bank.

58:36.379 --> 58:40.748
Except better than a bank
because banks always get knocked off.

58:40.816 --> 58:43.148
No one knocks off old Tony.

58:43.219 --> 58:45.744
Besides, with a bank...

58:45.821 --> 58:49.086
there's always tons of forms and all that shit.

58:49.158 --> 58:54.255
But old Tony, nothin' to read,
nothin' to write. It's all in his head.

58:55.564 --> 58:58.897
I know how to read now.

58:58.968 --> 59:02.096
That's good, Leon.

59:05.007 --> 59:06.599
Your money's here.

59:06.675 --> 59:09.371
Whenever you want it, you just ask me.

59:09.445 --> 59:13.506
- Here's a grand. Come on.
- It's okay. I don't need it.

59:13.582 --> 59:18.042
- Take it. Have some fun. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

59:18.120 --> 59:22.022
All right.
Now let's talk business.

59:22.091 --> 59:25.618
Don't move.
I'll go get the file.

59:25.694 --> 59:29.790
Manolo, a glass of milk for my friend Leon here.

59:53.055 --> 59:55.489
Listen, Mathilda, you better be careful.

59:55.558 --> 59:58.152
You can't just speak to any guy off the street.

59:59.395 --> 01:00:02.159
Leon, get a grip.
What's the big fucking deal?

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:04.995
I was just smoking a butt while I was waiting.

01:00:06.735 --> 01:00:08.999
I want you to stop cursing.

01:00:09.071 --> 01:00:11.335
You can't talk to people like that all the time.

01:00:11.407 --> 01:00:14.501
I want you to make an effort to talk nice.

01:00:19.248 --> 01:00:22.479
And I want you to stop smoking.
It will kill you.

01:00:29.091 --> 01:00:31.855
Stay away from him.
He looks like a weirdo.

01:00:36.932 --> 01:00:40.698
I'll be out in five minutes.
Stand where I can see you.

01:00:54.116 --> 01:00:58.314
Leon, I think I'm kinda
falling in love with you.

01:01:00.890 --> 01:01:04.189
It's the first time for me, you know.

01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:07.627
How do you know it's love
if you've never been in love before?

01:01:07.696 --> 01:01:10.563
'Cause I feel it.

01:01:10.633 --> 01:01:12.225
Where?

01:01:15.838 --> 01:01:17.772
In my stomach.

01:01:20.676 --> 01:01:24.134
It's all warm.

01:01:24.213 --> 01:01:29.446
I always had a knot there, and now it's gone.

01:01:32.354 --> 01:01:37.621
Mathilda, I'm glad you
don't have a stomachache anymore.

01:01:37.693 --> 01:01:40.161
I don't think it means anything.

01:01:40.229 --> 01:01:44.097
I'm late for work.
I hate being late for work.

01:02:28.477 --> 01:02:30.502
How's the practicing going?

01:03:00.442 --> 01:03:05.573
- How are we today, miss?
- A little sick of practicing.

01:03:05.648 --> 01:03:07.582
I understand.

01:03:07.650 --> 01:03:09.584
But you're doing all right.

01:03:09.652 --> 01:03:11.643
I haven't received any complaints.

01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:15.986
I put a cloth over the strings
to lessen the noise.

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:18.650
That's very smart.

01:03:18.727 --> 01:03:23.357
- Not everyone loves music.
- I know.

01:03:23.432 --> 01:03:25.559
What does your father do?

01:03:26.969 --> 01:03:31.429
- He's a composer.
- That's wonderful.

01:03:31.507 --> 01:03:34.067
Except he's not really my father.

01:03:39.648 --> 01:03:41.377
He's my lover.

01:03:45.454 --> 01:03:48.787
Think I'll go for a walk.

01:04:03.505 --> 01:04:07.100
- What are you doing Saturday night?
- What about dinner?

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:10.270
- Where you goin'?
- Visiting friends at 6J.

01:04:10.346 --> 01:04:12.211
Go ahead.
What about Saturday?

01:04:12.281 --> 01:04:16.240
- About 8:00?
- I don't know.

01:04:16.318 --> 01:04:20.414
You got plans?

01:04:25.828 --> 01:04:27.693
Meet you here?

01:05:42.704 --> 01:05:45.264
We know you're a busy man.
We'll make this short.

01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:49.276
If you'll just take us step-by-step
through exactly what happened.

01:05:50.345 --> 01:05:53.178
The guy was here.
He went for his gun.

01:05:53.248 --> 01:05:55.443
Bang, we shot him.

01:05:58.754 --> 01:06:01.689
- Where exactly were the kids?
- I don't know!

01:06:01.757 --> 01:06:04.248
They should have been at school,
don't you think?

01:06:04.326 --> 01:06:06.260
Your statement said you were the first man in.

01:06:06.328 --> 01:06:08.353
- Didn't you see any kids?
- The door was broken.

01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:10.489
What happened?
Did you follow the procedure?

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:16.162
I lost a good man here.
What the fuck do you want with me?

01:06:16.238 --> 01:06:18.672
Cooperation.

01:06:22.110 --> 01:06:26.012
I haven't got time
for this Mickey Mouse bullshit!

01:06:26.081 --> 01:06:30.711
You want cooperation?
Come up in my office, room 4602.

01:06:41.797 --> 01:06:43.890
Kids should be at school.

01:06:45.133 --> 01:06:47.727
Come on, that's my ball!

01:06:47.803 --> 01:06:52.297
Give that back.
Where you goin'?

01:06:52.374 --> 01:06:55.810
Damn! Where you goin', man?
That's my ball!

01:07:02.551 --> 01:07:04.485
Follow the blue car.

01:07:04.553 --> 01:07:07.716
You want me to blast the music
and go through the lights?

01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:09.347
No, drive slowly.

01:07:09.424 --> 01:07:12.222
Take the hundred bucks, and shut the fuck up.

01:07:45.253 --> 01:07:48.689
<i>I do not want to fight you,
but you leave me no choice.</i>

01:07:50.792 --> 01:07:55.126
<i>Boy, you just gave me
a great idea!</i>

01:07:59.100 --> 01:08:02.228
<i>- I mean a big one!
- Welcome back to E! News Daily...</i>

01:08:02.303 --> 01:08:05.431
<i>our 30-minute look at the latest
in entertainment news.</i>

01:08:05.506 --> 01:08:07.440
<i>I'm Bianca Ferrar.</i>

01:08:12.146 --> 01:08:15.081
It's for you.
A present.

01:08:17.318 --> 01:08:20.810
Do you want me to open it?
I'll open it.

01:08:25.859 --> 01:08:29.523
How do you like it?
Nice, eh?

01:08:29.596 --> 01:08:31.531
Mr. McGuffin?

01:08:33.968 --> 01:08:36.528
Can I have a word with you?

01:09:56.851 --> 01:10:00.048
Here. It's for a contract.
Twenty grand, right?

01:10:00.121 --> 01:10:03.113
His name is Norman Stansfield,
and he's in room 4602...

01:10:03.191 --> 01:10:06.183
in the D.E.A. building,
26 Federal Plaza.

01:10:07.095 --> 01:10:09.620
- I'm not taking it.
- Why not?

01:10:10.498 --> 01:10:12.523
- It's too heavy.
- Well.

01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:14.431
Will you rent me your gear for the day?

01:10:14.502 --> 01:10:17.130
I never lend out my gear.

01:10:17.205 --> 01:10:19.070
But...

01:10:19.140 --> 01:10:21.108
you still have your gun.
Use it.

01:10:21.175 --> 01:10:24.611
Just do me a favor.
Don't shoot out the window.

01:10:24.679 --> 01:10:27.170
Why are you so mean to me?

01:10:28.716 --> 01:10:31.241
Wildly killing people
you don't give a shit about...

01:10:31.319 --> 01:10:35.016
but you won't get the bastards
that killed my whole family?

01:10:35.656 --> 01:10:38.523
Revenge is not good
once you're done. Believe.

01:10:39.260 --> 01:10:41.854
- It's better to forget.
- Forget?

01:10:41.929 --> 01:10:44.921
After I've seen the outline
of my brother's body on the floor...

01:10:44.999 --> 01:10:46.990
you expect me to forget?

01:10:47.068 --> 01:10:49.195
I want to kill those sons of bitches.

01:10:49.270 --> 01:10:51.101
Blow their fucking heads off.

01:10:51.172 --> 01:10:54.141
Nothing's the same after you've killed someone.

01:10:56.244 --> 01:10:59.236
Your life is changed forever.

01:11:00.815 --> 01:11:04.717
You have to sleep with one eye open
for the rest of your life.

01:11:04.786 --> 01:11:07.482
I don't give a shit about sleeping, Leon.

01:11:08.422 --> 01:11:10.481
I want love...

01:11:10.825 --> 01:11:12.725
or death.

01:11:13.661 --> 01:11:15.322
That's it.

01:11:17.031 --> 01:11:19.226
I want death.

01:11:19.767 --> 01:11:23.100
Get off my case, Mathilda.
I'm tired of your games.

01:11:26.908 --> 01:11:29.069
There's this really great game, Leon.

01:11:29.143 --> 01:11:32.635
Makes people nicer.
Starts them thinking.

01:11:36.918 --> 01:11:39.352
The kind of game you love.

01:11:51.699 --> 01:11:53.530
If I win...

01:11:54.535 --> 01:11:57.470
you keep me with you...
for life.

01:11:59.607 --> 01:12:01.268
And if you lose?

01:12:01.342 --> 01:12:04.778
Go shopping alone, like before.

01:12:06.848 --> 01:12:09.339
You're gonna lose, Mathilda.

01:12:10.952 --> 01:12:13.785
There's a round in the chamber.
I heard it.

01:12:13.855 --> 01:12:15.220
So what?

01:12:15.289 --> 01:12:18.349
What's it to you if I end up
with a bullet in the head?

01:12:21.095 --> 01:12:22.653
Nothing.

01:12:26.500 --> 01:12:28.730
I hope you're not lying, Leon.

01:12:30.037 --> 01:12:33.370
I really hope that deep down inside
there's no love in you.

01:12:36.444 --> 01:12:38.435
Because if there is...

01:12:38.512 --> 01:12:41.777
just a little bit of love in there for me...

01:12:44.151 --> 01:12:47.245
I think that in a few minutes
you'll regret you never said anything.

01:12:57.131 --> 01:12:59.122
I love you, Leon.

01:13:16.183 --> 01:13:17.616
I win.

01:13:35.069 --> 01:13:37.503
I took a hit.

01:13:38.239 --> 01:13:40.673
I need a hand now.

01:13:40.741 --> 01:13:44.837
I know she's young, but she learns fast.

01:13:44.912 --> 01:13:47.073
Kids need to be shaped into something, right?

01:13:47.148 --> 01:13:50.413
I know. I taught you that.
But ain't there an age limit?

01:13:50.484 --> 01:13:52.418
She's 18.

01:13:52.486 --> 01:13:54.420
Really?

01:13:58.125 --> 01:13:59.990
How about something to drink, Tony?

01:14:00.061 --> 01:14:03.553
Sure. Manolo, glass of milk
for Leon.

01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:08.034
Nice tattoo.

01:14:12.673 --> 01:14:16.109
Manolo, make that two.

01:14:35.629 --> 01:14:38.427
- What's that for?
- Can't afford to catch cold.

01:14:39.467 --> 01:14:41.458
First you find out where the chain is.

01:14:41.535 --> 01:14:44.902
You can't see it,
but you can feel it. Here.

01:14:44.972 --> 01:14:47.702
- I'll ring, you start talking.
- What do I say?

01:14:48.676 --> 01:14:50.507
Whatever you want.

01:14:52.546 --> 01:14:54.480
- Yes?
- Hi.

01:14:54.548 --> 01:14:56.482
It's Susan.

01:14:56.550 --> 01:14:59.781
I'm sorry. You must have
the wrong door, little girl.

01:14:59.854 --> 01:15:02.254
I don't know any Susan.

01:15:02.323 --> 01:15:06.384
Move back a little.
I can't see anything.

01:15:06.460 --> 01:15:09.054
The light's out.

01:15:09.130 --> 01:15:11.064
It's all dark out here.

01:15:14.335 --> 01:15:18.829
- Mister, I'm scared.
- Okay.

01:15:23.511 --> 01:15:26.241
What the fuck are you doing?

01:15:31.485 --> 01:15:32.816
Open up.

01:15:34.588 --> 01:15:37.648
<i>If it leaves your mouth,
I'll pull the trigger, capisce?</i>

01:16:15.196 --> 01:16:17.460
Here's okay.
Let it go.

01:16:17.531 --> 01:16:19.897
I said, "Let it go."

01:16:19.967 --> 01:16:22.367
Move. Move over.

01:16:23.904 --> 01:16:25.394
Easy. Easy.

01:16:25.473 --> 01:16:28.408
Easy. Careful.
You want me...

01:16:29.977 --> 01:16:32.707
Go ahead. Your turn.

01:16:39.620 --> 01:16:42.088
Help me.
Please don't beat me.

01:16:42.156 --> 01:16:44.716
Sir?

01:16:47.795 --> 01:16:49.854
Sir, it's not my dope.

01:16:49.930 --> 01:16:51.898
Sir, look I...

01:16:51.966 --> 01:16:53.900
A little left, please.

01:16:57.404 --> 01:16:58.928
Before... Ple...

01:17:01.609 --> 01:17:04.510
Now, the security shot.

01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:12.513
No, the second goes higher on the chest.

01:17:12.586 --> 01:17:14.952
Aim for the heart and lungs.

01:17:15.022 --> 01:17:17.047
There. Right there.
You see?

01:17:17.124 --> 01:17:19.058
The first shot takes him out of order.

01:17:19.126 --> 01:17:22.027
- The second finishes him off.
- What are you fucking doing?

01:17:22.096 --> 01:17:23.586
Never in the face.

01:17:23.664 --> 01:17:26.895
If they can't recognize the client,
you don't get paid.

01:17:26.967 --> 01:17:30.630
You could take out anybody
and said you did the job.

01:17:30.704 --> 01:17:33.400
- Got it?
- Got it. Never in the face.

01:17:33.474 --> 01:17:36.932
- Now you can put the tools away.
- What are you fucking doing?

01:17:37.011 --> 01:17:39.309
What the fuck is going on?
Hey, mister!

01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:41.905
What are you fuckin...

01:17:44.952 --> 01:17:47.614
You see, when you use the silencer a lot...

01:17:47.688 --> 01:17:49.952
you have to put a piece of cloth here...

01:17:50.024 --> 01:17:52.925
because it gets very hot
and could burn it inside.

01:17:52.993 --> 01:17:55.723
A damp, black cloth is the best.

01:17:59.066 --> 01:18:01.000
What you doing?

01:18:01.068 --> 01:18:04.299
We said no women, no kids.

01:18:04.371 --> 01:18:08.068
Who do you think this is gonna kill,
junkies and monkeys?

01:18:23.657 --> 01:18:25.955
Now it's clean.

01:18:27.027 --> 01:18:29.825
Let's get out of here.

01:18:43.277 --> 01:18:45.211
I thought we don't have the right to drink.

01:18:45.279 --> 01:18:49.443
I know, but we're making
an exception for your first time.

01:18:51.552 --> 01:18:56.888
Well, if we're making exceptions
for a job well-done...

01:18:56.957 --> 01:19:00.791
how about a kiss, like in the movies?

01:19:04.465 --> 01:19:06.399
Yes.

01:19:07.468 --> 01:19:09.197
What you doing?

01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:11.738
- I'm going to kiss you.
- I want you to stop, please.

01:19:11.805 --> 01:19:14.638
Come on. Just a kiss.

01:19:14.708 --> 01:19:18.041
Stop. Everyone is watching us.

01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:22.915
Go sit down.

01:19:30.090 --> 01:19:32.024
Enjoy.

01:19:37.598 --> 01:19:40.499
- You don't believe me, do you?
- How's that?

01:19:40.567 --> 01:19:45.595
- When I say I'm in love with you.
- Mathilda, please drop it.

01:19:45.673 --> 01:19:49.473
- Just change the subject, okay?
- Okay. Sorry.

01:19:50.778 --> 01:19:54.805
So, how old were you
when you made your first hit?

01:19:54.882 --> 01:19:57.442
Nineteen.

01:19:57.518 --> 01:19:59.452
Beat you.

01:21:03.917 --> 01:21:08.354
- What you doing?
- Can't afford to catch a cold.

01:21:55.068 --> 01:21:58.902
- There's no doorbell.
- So knock on the door.

01:22:02.576 --> 01:22:05.568
- Yes?
- Hi.

01:22:06.046 --> 01:22:07.980
I'm looking
for Mr. Reuben's apartment...

01:22:08.048 --> 01:22:11.814
but it's all dark out here
in the hall, and I'm lost.

01:22:11.885 --> 01:22:13.819
Just a second.

01:22:25.933 --> 01:22:29.266
You want more? Come on.
Show your fucking face.

01:22:29.336 --> 01:22:32.100
You think you're going to get me that easily?

01:22:36.610 --> 01:22:40.011
When it's tough like this,
you know it's gonna be ugly.

01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:44.210
Better make it quick or else
we'll be all day listening to his crap.

01:22:44.284 --> 01:22:47.048
Asshole! Come on, show me
your fucking face, faggot!

01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:49.452
- Come on, gum trick.
- Hey.

01:22:50.691 --> 01:22:53.057
What about the ring trick?
You know that one?

01:22:53.126 --> 01:22:55.594
Ring trick? Come on, asshole.
I'm waiting.

01:22:55.662 --> 01:22:57.596
Show it to me, motherfucker.

01:23:06.607 --> 01:23:09.542
That's the ring trick.

01:23:23.390 --> 01:23:27.486
Mario, go back to the barbershop.
We'll finish later.

01:23:38.605 --> 01:23:41.904
Leon, what's up?
All done already?

01:23:44.778 --> 01:23:47.770
Nicer than people, eh?

01:23:47.848 --> 01:23:49.782
I told you that.

01:23:52.019 --> 01:23:53.953
You got a problem?

01:23:56.823 --> 01:23:58.791
Get the chair. Sit down.

01:24:03.997 --> 01:24:07.956
I was thinking.

01:24:10.637 --> 01:24:14.300
If something happens to me someday...

01:24:14.374 --> 01:24:18.208
Hey, Leon, nothing's gonna happen to you.

01:24:18.278 --> 01:24:21.247
You're indestructible. Bullets
slide off you. You play with 'em.

01:24:21.315 --> 01:24:25.445
Tony, I thought about my money.

01:24:28.655 --> 01:24:34.218
You remember the girl
who came here the other day?

01:24:38.665 --> 01:24:43.568
Her name is Mathilda.

01:24:43.637 --> 01:24:46.936
If anything happens to me...

01:24:47.007 --> 01:24:51.205
I'd like you...

01:24:52.713 --> 01:24:55.147
to give her...

01:24:56.850 --> 01:24:59.478
my money.

01:25:01.788 --> 01:25:04.416
You can count on me, Leon.

01:25:04.491 --> 01:25:06.925
Thank you, Tony.

01:25:10.330 --> 01:25:12.161
I won't be long.

01:25:13.634 --> 01:25:16.603
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

01:25:17.738 --> 01:25:20.707
This one is too big.

01:25:21.441 --> 01:25:24.808
Yeah, and I only get the leftovers, is that it?

01:25:26.713 --> 01:25:29.045
Mathilda, since I met you...

01:25:29.116 --> 01:25:31.243
everything's been different.

01:25:31.418 --> 01:25:35.855
So I just need some time alone.

01:25:38.625 --> 01:25:40.616
You need some time to grow up a little.

01:25:40.694 --> 01:25:43.390
I finished growing up, Leon.

01:25:43.463 --> 01:25:45.294
I just get older.

01:25:45.365 --> 01:25:48.823
For me it's the opposite.
I'm old enough.

01:25:50.570 --> 01:25:52.595
I need time to grow up.

01:26:07.688 --> 01:26:09.679
Shit.

01:27:24.765 --> 01:27:27.165
Come on! Hustle!

01:27:29.236 --> 01:27:31.067
- Good shot.
- Come on.

01:27:34.341 --> 01:27:36.969
You're new, aren't you?
Fifth floor, right?

01:27:37.410 --> 01:27:39.970
- You can't sit here like that.
- Really, why not?

01:27:40.046 --> 01:27:42.514
Nothing's free.
Like a parking meter.

01:27:42.582 --> 01:27:45.551
When you stop, you pay.
It's the law.

01:27:45.685 --> 01:27:47.744
- Only on T.V.
- What'd you say?

01:27:47.854 --> 01:27:51.381
- Forget it. How much is your meter?
- Ten dollars...

01:27:51.458 --> 01:27:53.119
a month.

01:27:55.428 --> 01:27:57.259
Got change?

01:27:58.765 --> 01:28:01.063
Don't worry about it.
We'll do ten for twelve.

01:28:01.134 --> 01:28:03.364
I'll pay now for the rest of the year.

01:28:03.436 --> 01:28:04.926
Okay, a year.

01:28:05.772 --> 01:28:08.866
Does paying rent here mean
I have to put up with you guys?

01:28:12.045 --> 01:28:14.536
So go play somewhere else.

01:28:17.951 --> 01:28:20.283
I need to think.

01:29:17.210 --> 01:29:20.407
Stand up.
Don't you like your job?

01:29:30.423 --> 01:29:31.856
Food.

01:29:35.362 --> 01:29:40.095
- Where you going?
- Special delivery, room 4602.

01:29:40.166 --> 01:29:41.827
Sign here.

01:29:41.902 --> 01:29:43.426
Come here.

01:29:46.106 --> 01:29:50.167
- Have a nice weekend, girls.
- Thanks.

01:29:50.243 --> 01:29:52.177
I'm gonna go to the restroom.

01:31:11.791 --> 01:31:14.225
Special delivery?

01:31:14.294 --> 01:31:16.228
Let me guess.

01:31:18.398 --> 01:31:19.865
Chinese?

01:31:22.769 --> 01:31:25.033
Thai, maybe?

01:31:27.707 --> 01:31:30.540
I've got it.

01:31:30.610 --> 01:31:32.840
Italian food.

01:31:49.462 --> 01:31:51.396
What's your name, angel?

01:32:21.428 --> 01:32:24.591
I want you to put the sack on the floor.

01:32:30.036 --> 01:32:31.469
Good.

01:32:34.107 --> 01:32:39.170
Now I want you to tell me everything
you know about Italian food.

01:32:39.245 --> 01:32:42.146
Don't forget the name of the chef
who fixed it for me.

01:32:42.215 --> 01:32:46.845
Nobody sent me.
I do business for myself.

01:32:49.289 --> 01:32:51.223
So this is something...

01:32:53.126 --> 01:32:55.560
personal, is it?

01:32:59.566 --> 01:33:03.662
What filthy piece of shit...

01:33:03.736 --> 01:33:05.670
did I do now?

01:33:05.738 --> 01:33:09.003
You killed my brother.

01:33:12.946 --> 01:33:14.880
I'm sorry.

01:33:23.256 --> 01:33:25.884
And you wanna join him?

01:33:29.863 --> 01:33:33.526
It's always the same thing.

01:33:37.937 --> 01:33:42.840
It's when you start to become
really afraid of death...

01:33:42.909 --> 01:33:46.470
that you learn to appreciate life.

01:33:46.546 --> 01:33:50.915
Do you like life, sweetheart?

01:33:57.790 --> 01:33:59.223
That's good.

01:34:04.164 --> 01:34:08.100
Because I take no pleasure...

01:34:09.469 --> 01:34:12.836
in taking a life...

01:34:12.906 --> 01:34:17.866
if it's from a person who doesn't care about it.

01:34:28.288 --> 01:34:30.848
Stan, I've been looking all over for you.

01:34:30.924 --> 01:34:34.223
- I checked upstairs...
- What? I'm busy.

01:34:34.294 --> 01:34:37.127
It's Malky, man.
He's dead.

01:34:39.332 --> 01:34:42.597
Malky was makin' a buy for us from the Chinaman.

01:34:42.669 --> 01:34:45.502
<i>But they got nothin'
to do with it.</i>

01:34:45.572 --> 01:34:51.442
<i>They told me this guy came
from the outside. He was a pro.</i>

01:34:51.511 --> 01:34:54.605
<i>He was fast.
He fuckin' came out of nowhere.</i>

01:34:54.681 --> 01:34:57.616
<i>Boom, shoots the Chinaman dead
in two seconds.</i>

01:34:57.684 --> 01:35:01.279
Easy, man.
I'm a cop.

01:35:01.354 --> 01:35:04.255
Then turns around,
says something to Malky like...

01:35:04.324 --> 01:35:06.485
No women, no kids.

01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:17.333
I think it was somethin' personal.

01:35:18.705 --> 01:35:24.007
Death is whimsical today.

01:35:51.070 --> 01:35:54.767
Blood, do you hear me?

01:35:54.841 --> 01:35:59.278
Yeah, I hear you, Stan.
Just chill out, man.

01:35:59.345 --> 01:36:01.779
Would you take her up to my office?

01:36:03.449 --> 01:36:05.041
All right.

01:36:13.393 --> 01:36:15.520
Jesus fucking Christ.

01:36:27.840 --> 01:36:29.273
<i>"Leon, my love.</i>

01:36:29.342 --> 01:36:31.810
<i>I know where to find the guys
who killed my brother.</i>

01:36:31.878 --> 01:36:36.577
<i>Their boss is Norman Stansfield.
He's in the D.E.A. building, room 4602.</i>

01:36:36.649 --> 01:36:38.617
<i>I'm gonna do them myself.</i>

01:36:38.685 --> 01:36:42.485
<i>If something goes wrong,
I left you 20 grand on the table.</i>

01:36:42.555 --> 01:36:46.514
<i>It's for a contract.
Five grand a head, right?</i>

01:36:46.592 --> 01:36:50.494
<i>I know I'll feel better
after I do this.</i>

01:36:50.563 --> 01:36:52.497
<i>I love you."</i>

01:36:57.570 --> 01:36:59.401
Wait. I won't be long.

01:36:59.472 --> 01:37:02.737
I can't park in front like this.
It's a federal building!

01:37:07.313 --> 01:37:10.680
He's gonna do the same exact thing that I said.

01:37:10.750 --> 01:37:13.344
A nine "millie."

01:37:13.419 --> 01:37:15.546
Bullets.

01:37:15.621 --> 01:37:17.054
Another nine "millie."

01:37:20.493 --> 01:37:22.518
What'd you plan to do with all these guns?

01:37:22.595 --> 01:37:25.564
Maybe she was planning on
taking out the whole building.

01:37:29.736 --> 01:37:31.567
Holy shit!

01:37:31.637 --> 01:37:33.298
What's this? Lunch.

01:37:35.908 --> 01:37:38.001
Careful, Blood, might be poisoned.

01:37:38.077 --> 01:37:40.068
There's no anchovies on this.

01:37:57.497 --> 01:38:01.263
Is that what you call "I won't be long"?
I been here for ten minutes.

01:38:01.334 --> 01:38:04.030
I did my best.

01:38:51.717 --> 01:38:53.207
Do you like it?

01:38:55.054 --> 01:38:56.248
Yes.

01:38:56.889 --> 01:38:58.880
So say it.

01:39:01.360 --> 01:39:02.850
I like it.

01:39:17.743 --> 01:39:19.074
Not thirsty?

01:39:28.488 --> 01:39:31.548
You know, a girl's first time is very important.

01:39:31.624 --> 01:39:34.718
It determines the rest of her life sexually.

01:39:34.794 --> 01:39:37.922
I read that once in one
of my sister's magazines.

01:39:38.197 --> 01:39:41.633
My girlfriends told me
they hated their first experience.

01:39:42.869 --> 01:39:46.066
That's because they didn't love the guys.

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:49.499
They just did it to show off.

01:39:49.575 --> 01:39:53.375
Afterwards, they started liking it,
like cigarettes.

01:39:57.483 --> 01:40:00.077
Will I like it the first time?

01:40:04.223 --> 01:40:06.214
Mathilda, no.

01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:10.151
Why not?

01:40:10.563 --> 01:40:12.758
I just can't.

01:40:13.799 --> 01:40:16.290
- You love someone else?
- No.

01:40:17.236 --> 01:40:19.067
I mean...

01:40:22.575 --> 01:40:25.271
There was someone a long time ago.

01:40:26.512 --> 01:40:28.844
Before I came to the States.

01:40:29.348 --> 01:40:32.613
Her father didn't want her to see me.

01:40:33.419 --> 01:40:36.877
She was from a very respectable family.

01:40:38.124 --> 01:40:39.614
Mine was...

01:40:40.426 --> 01:40:42.257
you know...

01:40:43.996 --> 01:40:45.657
not so respectable.

01:40:45.731 --> 01:40:49.599
Her dad went nuts every time
she'd take off to see me.

01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:52.001
She still snuck off to see you, right?

01:40:53.773 --> 01:40:55.138
Right.

01:40:55.207 --> 01:40:57.607
See, nothing can stop love, Leon.

01:41:00.079 --> 01:41:02.070
He killed her.

01:41:02.748 --> 01:41:04.875
One shot through the head.

01:41:08.387 --> 01:41:12.619
They kept him in jail for two days,
and they let him go free.

01:41:14.527 --> 01:41:16.722
They said it was an accident.

01:41:18.898 --> 01:41:20.388
So...

01:41:22.101 --> 01:41:24.228
one night I...

01:41:24.604 --> 01:41:26.595
waited for him.

01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:30.340
Five hundred feet with a lens.

01:41:33.179 --> 01:41:35.010
He also had an accident.

01:41:36.282 --> 01:41:39.945
The same night I took a boat and came here...

01:41:40.019 --> 01:41:44.149
to meet up with my father
who was working for Tony.

01:41:44.590 --> 01:41:46.922
I was 19.

01:41:50.363 --> 01:41:54.163
Since then I've never left the city, and...

01:41:57.837 --> 01:42:00.203
I've never had another girlfriend.

01:42:03.242 --> 01:42:05.870
You see, Mathilda...

01:42:05.945 --> 01:42:08.004
I wouldn't be a good lover.

01:42:10.383 --> 01:42:12.044
Okay.

01:42:15.154 --> 01:42:17.384
Would you do me one favor?

01:42:17.456 --> 01:42:18.946
What?

01:42:19.025 --> 01:42:21.425
I'm sick of watching you sleep on your chair.

01:42:21.494 --> 01:42:23.655
We're gonna share the bed.

01:42:24.597 --> 01:42:26.929
I don't think it's a good idea.

01:42:28.300 --> 01:42:30.200
It's okay.

01:42:30.369 --> 01:42:32.667
Put your legs up on the bed.

01:42:32.738 --> 01:42:34.797
Yeah. That's nice.

01:42:39.211 --> 01:42:41.611
Put your head down.
It's okay. Relax.

01:43:03.335 --> 01:43:05.326
Good night, Leon.

01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:10.071
Good night.

01:43:32.598 --> 01:43:34.793
I want a piece of cake first!

01:43:39.805 --> 01:43:44.037
Manolo, take the kids in the kitchen.

01:44:03.229 --> 01:44:06.198
I have a lot of respect for your business, Tony.

01:44:06.265 --> 01:44:08.859
When you've killed for us in the past...

01:44:08.934 --> 01:44:12.426
we've always been satisfied.

01:44:12.505 --> 01:44:18.102
That's exactly why today
is going to be very hard for me.

01:44:18.177 --> 01:44:20.111
I hope you'll excuse my mood.

01:44:24.316 --> 01:44:28.309
My man was killed right here on your turf.

01:44:28.387 --> 01:44:31.481
The Chinks tell me that the hit man...

01:44:31.557 --> 01:44:35.391
was kind of the Italian type.

01:44:35.461 --> 01:44:39.295
So we figured that Tony might know something.

01:44:39.365 --> 01:44:41.833
Wait. There's more.

01:44:41.901 --> 01:44:44.028
You're gonna love this.

01:44:46.372 --> 01:44:51.742
A few hours later, a little 12-year-old
girl comes into my office...

01:44:51.811 --> 01:44:56.578
armed to the teeth, with the firm
intention of sending me to the morgue.

01:44:56.649 --> 01:45:00.415
Do you know who came and got her
right there in my building?

01:45:01.687 --> 01:45:03.882
The very same...

01:45:03.956 --> 01:45:06.049
Italian hit man.

01:45:10.696 --> 01:45:13.130
I'm dying to meet him.

01:45:17.803 --> 01:45:22.172
Relax. Everything's fine.
Sleep well?

01:45:22.241 --> 01:45:26.405
I never really sleep.
Got one eye open always.

01:45:26.478 --> 01:45:28.469
Yeah, I forgot.

01:45:28.547 --> 01:45:31.482
I never saw someone with one eye open
snore so much.

01:45:33.018 --> 01:45:35.987
- I snore?
- Like a baby.

01:45:37.590 --> 01:45:40.616
I'm gonna get some milk for breakfast.
I won't be long.

01:45:40.693 --> 01:45:42.558
Don't forget the code when you come back.

01:45:42.628 --> 01:45:45.153
Two knocks, then one,
and two knocks again. Right?

01:45:45.231 --> 01:45:46.664
Right.

01:46:07.052 --> 01:46:09.987
Ring these up.
I'm gonna go get some milk.

01:46:30.309 --> 01:46:32.277
From here on out, you don't make a sound.

01:46:32.344 --> 01:46:36.280
You answer my questions
by nodding yes or shaking your head no.

01:46:36.348 --> 01:46:38.908
Is he alone?

01:46:38.984 --> 01:46:41.179
Does he expect you?

01:46:41.253 --> 01:46:44.450
Do you have keys to the apartment?

01:46:44.523 --> 01:46:47.788
Is there a code, a way of knocking,
so he knows it's you?

01:47:35.874 --> 01:47:37.273
Alpha team.

01:47:37.343 --> 01:47:40.938
<i>- Final position. We're ready to go.
- Be careful.</i>

01:48:27.993 --> 01:48:31.156
What up? Move! Fuck.

01:48:36.502 --> 01:48:38.333
Shit.

01:48:39.772 --> 01:48:41.763
Alpha team. Man down.

01:48:43.008 --> 01:48:45.135
I told you.

01:48:49.014 --> 01:48:51.778
- Bring me everyone.
- What do you mean, "everyone"?

01:48:51.850 --> 01:48:54.318
Everyone!

01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:50.074
Take this.

01:49:55.914 --> 01:49:59.008
Go take a look.

01:50:13.031 --> 01:50:16.398
- Don't move.
- Do you see anything?

01:50:18.270 --> 01:50:22.206
It's the guy. He's here.
He's got a gun to my head.

01:50:25.310 --> 01:50:26.834
Nobody moves.

01:50:26.912 --> 01:50:29.779
- Let the girl go.
- Take it easy, man!

01:50:32.251 --> 01:50:35.687
Okay, the girl's comin' out.
Let the girl go.

01:50:45.764 --> 01:50:49.063
Grab the axe off the wall.
Over there. Go!

01:50:52.404 --> 01:50:54.463
You're coming with us.

01:51:06.718 --> 01:51:08.481
Christ, he shot him!

01:51:09.922 --> 01:51:12.390
Bastard!

01:51:21.466 --> 01:51:22.899
Move!

01:51:26.939 --> 01:51:29.066
- Shut the fucking water off!
- Got it.

01:51:29.141 --> 01:51:31.268
Come!

01:51:32.411 --> 01:51:36.108
We're in a bad way here.
Send the cats.

01:51:46.225 --> 01:51:49.922
I don't know what happened.
I didn't see 'em coming, I swear!

01:51:49.995 --> 01:51:55.558
I just went shopping and I came back,
and they were everywhere.

01:51:57.336 --> 01:51:59.463
Stay away from the window.

01:52:45.851 --> 01:52:47.284
Come here.

01:52:49.755 --> 01:52:51.188
Snipers.

01:52:53.258 --> 01:52:57.160
Okay, now, get this fucking asshole
out of there.

01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:18.714
- How are we gonna get outta here now?
- Leave it to me. We're checking out.

01:54:19.244 --> 01:54:22.873
But it's not big enough for you.
It's barely big enough for me.

01:54:22.948 --> 01:54:26.748
- We said no discussion.
- No, I'm not letting...

01:54:26.818 --> 01:54:31.812
- I'm not going! I won't go!
- Listen to me.

01:54:33.325 --> 01:54:35.623
We have no chance together.
But if I'm alone, I can do it.

01:54:35.694 --> 01:54:37.924
Trust me.
I'm in good shape.

01:54:37.996 --> 01:54:40.794
I know I've got a lot of money with Tony.

01:54:40.866 --> 01:54:43.528
We'll take it and leave together,
just the two of us.

01:54:43.602 --> 01:54:45.092
Go.

01:54:45.170 --> 01:54:48.469
You're saying that so I won't worry.

01:54:52.377 --> 01:54:55.835
- I don't wanna lose you.
- You're not gonna lose me.

01:54:55.914 --> 01:54:57.848
You've given me a taste for life.

01:54:57.916 --> 01:55:01.249
I wanna be happy, sleep in a bed, have roots.

01:55:01.319 --> 01:55:03.446
You'll never be alone again.

01:55:06.792 --> 01:55:09.989
Please, go now, baby. Go.

01:55:12.063 --> 01:55:14.531
Calm down.
Go now. Go.

01:55:17.235 --> 01:55:21.228
See you at Tony's. I'm gonna
clean them all. Tony's in an hour.

01:55:26.912 --> 01:55:29.142
I love you, Mathilda.

01:55:29.214 --> 01:55:31.273
I love you, too, Leon.

01:56:06.284 --> 01:56:11.779
Hey, what is going on up there?
Take the guy out, not the building.

01:56:32.010 --> 01:56:34.137
We've got one breathing here!

01:56:36.014 --> 01:56:38.278
Get a medic on the horn!

01:56:41.720 --> 01:56:44.120
Clear the hall!
Let him through!

01:56:46.758 --> 01:56:50.558
- We've got a wounded man. Make way!
- Down those stairs.

01:56:53.698 --> 01:56:55.393
Let's go! Move!

01:56:55.467 --> 01:56:57.264
Get that guy off the stairs!

01:56:57.335 --> 01:57:00.827
- Get your team back out there!
- I got him!

01:57:00.906 --> 01:57:03.966
We've got two men comin'
down the stairs. Let's hurry!

01:57:25.730 --> 01:57:29.564
You okay?
Hey, I need a medic over here!

01:57:29.634 --> 01:57:31.659
Move your fuckin' asses.

01:57:31.736 --> 01:57:34.227
Squad Number One,
what's the status on the apartment?

01:57:34.306 --> 01:57:36.638
<i>Can't see shit. Too much smoke.
Give us five minutes.</i>

01:57:36.708 --> 01:57:38.141
You got it.

01:57:38.209 --> 01:57:41.838
What? Two hundred men can't find
one man and a girl?

01:57:41.913 --> 01:57:43.471
Did you find the girl?

01:57:52.724 --> 01:57:55.318
How are you doing?
Take your mask off, quick.

01:57:58.229 --> 01:58:02.325
Let me see you. That's deep.
Right. And this one here...

01:58:02.400 --> 01:58:05.631
You're from the 3rd Precinct?

01:58:08.106 --> 01:58:11.337
Let's open up his sleeve a little bit.

01:58:14.579 --> 01:58:17.673
All right, fine. Put it down.
This one.

01:58:34.499 --> 01:58:36.558
You stay there for two minutes.
I'll be right back.

01:58:36.635 --> 01:58:40.127
Let me put the mask back on.
I breathe better with it.

01:58:40.205 --> 01:58:44.198
You're all right.
Sit tight.

01:58:49.948 --> 01:58:55.409
Come on, everybody out!
Let's go! Out!

01:59:19.844 --> 01:59:22.972
Clear the way, men.

01:59:32.023 --> 01:59:34.389
What are you doing here?
Get out. Come on.

02:01:27.906 --> 02:01:30.033
At your service.

02:01:38.616 --> 02:01:42.575
This is from...

02:01:48.660 --> 02:01:50.924
Mathilda.

02:02:06.010 --> 02:02:07.875
Shit.

02:02:29.334 --> 02:02:30.767
Get out of here!

02:02:34.138 --> 02:02:37.005
Leon asked me to help you out...

02:02:37.075 --> 02:02:41.011
if somethin' happened,
and I think somethin' happened.

02:02:41.079 --> 02:02:44.845
He put aside a little cash for you.

02:02:44.916 --> 02:02:48.079
So what I'm suggesting is that...

02:02:48.152 --> 02:02:50.620
seein' as how you're still so young...

02:02:50.688 --> 02:02:53.623
I should hold the money for you
until you're older.

02:02:53.691 --> 02:02:55.818
Like a bank, you know, except...

02:02:55.894 --> 02:02:59.955
it's better than a bank
'cause banks always get knocked off.

02:03:00.031 --> 02:03:02.727
No one knocks off old Tony.

02:03:02.800 --> 02:03:05.462
But it's your money.
In the meantime...

02:03:05.536 --> 02:03:09.472
all you gotta do is come here
every once in awhile...

02:03:09.540 --> 02:03:13.306
and I'll dish it out
so you can have a little fun.

02:03:14.445 --> 02:03:15.878
Here.

02:03:15.947 --> 02:03:21.442
- Here's a hundred bucks to start.
- Can't I get a job instead?

02:03:21.519 --> 02:03:26.456
A job?
What the hell can you do?

02:03:26.524 --> 02:03:28.355
I can clean.

02:03:29.727 --> 02:03:32.195
I ain't got no work
for a 12-year-old kid...

02:03:32.263 --> 02:03:34.356
so get it out of your goddamn head!

02:03:34.432 --> 02:03:37.162
It's over!
The game's over!

02:03:37.235 --> 02:03:39.965
Leon's dead!

02:03:40.038 --> 02:03:42.006
You hear me?

02:03:49.213 --> 02:03:53.946
Come on. You think
I ain't hurtin' too?

02:03:59.424 --> 02:04:01.824
But he's dead.

02:04:01.893 --> 02:04:05.852
You're gonna forget all this craziness
and get your little ass back to school.

02:04:07.098 --> 02:04:10.192
Now take this money and get the hell outta here.

02:04:10.268 --> 02:04:12.361
Don't let me see your face till next month...

02:04:12.437 --> 02:04:16.703
'cause something tells me
I'm about to lose my famous kind streak.

02:05:07.959 --> 02:05:11.417
My parents...

02:05:11.496 --> 02:05:13.589
died...

02:05:13.664 --> 02:05:18.260
in a car accident four weeks ago.

02:05:18.336 --> 02:05:20.270
It was terrible.

02:05:22.840 --> 02:05:26.606
We didn't have the time to get to know
one another when you first came here...

02:05:26.677 --> 02:05:31.410
but I want you to know I'm not the kind
of woman who'd let down a child...

02:05:31.482 --> 02:05:34.815
whatever her situation, whatever her mistake.

02:05:34.886 --> 02:05:39.949
So I'm going to help you and do my best
to welcome you here again.

02:05:41.859 --> 02:05:44.521
But on one condition:

02:05:44.595 --> 02:05:47.792
You have to stop lying to me, Mathilda.

02:05:47.865 --> 02:05:50.026
I want you to take a chance...

02:05:50.101 --> 02:05:53.036
and trust me.

02:05:53.104 --> 02:05:55.629
Tell me what happened to you.

02:05:59.043 --> 02:06:02.137
My family got shot down
by D.E.A. officers...

02:06:02.213 --> 02:06:05.649
because of a drug problem.

02:06:05.716 --> 02:06:08.310
I left with the greatest guy on Earth.

02:06:08.386 --> 02:06:13.153
He was a hit man, the best in town,
but he died this morning.

02:06:13.224 --> 02:06:17.092
If you don't help me, I'll be dead by tonight.

02:06:36.481 --> 02:06:40.144
- You know her?
- I've never seen her.

02:07:06.711 --> 02:07:09.373
I think we'll be okay here.
