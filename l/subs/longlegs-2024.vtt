03:33.996 --> 03:35.998
Cuckoo!

04:20.085 --> 04:23.045
There she is,

04:23.045 --> 04:27.397
the Almost Birthday Girl.

04:27.397 --> 04:30.270
Oh, but...

04:30.270 --> 04:34.230
it seems I wore
my long legs today.

04:34.230 --> 04:36.493
What happens if I...?

04:48.766 --> 04:50.333
♪ Well, I've got
a little babe ♪

05:59.010 --> 06:01.056
All right, kids.

06:01.056 --> 06:02.840
This is the part
where you get to do the things

06:02.840 --> 06:05.843
the grownups
don't wanna do anymore.

06:05.843 --> 06:08.106
Door to door, on foot,

06:08.106 --> 06:09.717
knock-knock,
"Have you seen this man?"

06:09.717 --> 06:11.327
Just like in the movies.

06:13.982 --> 06:15.375
Partners have already
been assigned,

06:15.375 --> 06:18.247
so no one gets hurt feelings.

06:18.247 --> 06:22.338
Suspect likes to visit
a certain kind of neighborhood.

06:22.338 --> 06:24.209
He's a middle-aged
Caucasian male

06:24.209 --> 06:27.256
and not likely to go quietly,

06:27.256 --> 06:29.606
so let's always assume
he's armed.

06:30.999 --> 06:33.393
We'll go alert and careful.

06:34.132 --> 06:35.830
That's all.

06:45.405 --> 06:46.928
Okay, well,

06:46.928 --> 06:49.191
I am good to be the one
who goes up and knocks,

06:49.191 --> 06:52.455
if you wanna be the one
who hangs back.

06:53.935 --> 06:55.458
Harker?

06:55.458 --> 06:57.286
You good?

06:57.286 --> 06:58.853
Yeah, I'm good.

08:04.005 --> 08:06.137
That kid
smelled like narcotics.

08:06.137 --> 08:07.617
Harker.

08:09.619 --> 08:11.621
It's that one.

08:11.621 --> 08:14.232
What's what one?

08:14.232 --> 08:16.974
3525.

08:16.974 --> 08:18.585
He's in there.

08:19.977 --> 08:21.413
What makes you say that?

08:23.372 --> 08:25.548
I don't know.

08:25.548 --> 08:27.289
We should call it in.

08:27.289 --> 08:28.638
What? No.

08:29.770 --> 08:31.293
No, we're not gonna
call in a hunch

08:31.293 --> 08:33.513
on our first day out doing this.

08:36.254 --> 08:38.343
Just relax.

08:42.391 --> 08:44.524
But I'll go take a look.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.742
All right?

08:45.742 --> 08:47.527
Lee, relax.

08:58.799 --> 09:00.104
FBI!

09:11.899 --> 09:13.465
Hi there!

09:13.465 --> 09:15.598
Hi, I just wondered if you'd
take a look at that for me--

10:14.701 --> 10:15.876
Don't move.

10:16.790 --> 10:18.182
I won't.

10:35.373 --> 10:37.549
<i>State your name and rank.</i>

10:39.987 --> 10:42.816
Special Agent Lee Harker.

10:44.295 --> 10:46.602
Can someone tell me
what I'm doing in here?

10:46.602 --> 10:48.343
<i>Special Agent Lee Harker,</i>

10:48.343 --> 10:49.779
<i>are you ready to begin?</i>

10:51.433 --> 10:53.087
Ready to begin what?

10:54.349 --> 10:56.568
<i>State the first word
that comes to mind</i>

10:56.568 --> 10:58.353
<i>to accompany each image.</i>

10:59.310 --> 11:01.312
<i>Are you ready to begin?</i>

11:01.312 --> 11:03.227
Yes.

11:06.187 --> 11:07.449
Camera.

11:07.449 --> 11:08.711
Table.

11:08.711 --> 11:09.930
Legs.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.540
Tiger.

11:16.066 --> 11:17.415
Door.

11:17.415 --> 11:18.503
Mother.

11:18.503 --> 11:19.853
Father.

11:19.853 --> 11:21.506
Piano.

11:21.506 --> 11:23.160
<i>A number has been generated</i>

11:23.160 --> 11:25.075
<i>between zero and 100,</i>

11:25.075 --> 11:26.337
<i>inclusive.</i>

11:26.337 --> 11:28.557
<i>What is the number?</i>

11:30.733 --> 11:32.909
I-I don't know.

11:32.909 --> 11:34.215
33?

11:37.522 --> 11:38.698
<i>A number has been generated</i>

11:38.698 --> 11:41.570
<i>between zero and 100, inclusive.</i>

11:41.570 --> 11:43.398
<i>What is the number?</i>

11:46.357 --> 11:47.489
Zero.

11:54.365 --> 11:56.280
You a baseball fan, Harker?

11:56.933 --> 11:58.848
No, sir.

11:58.848 --> 12:00.154
Damn.

12:01.198 --> 12:05.333
I need to talk to someone
about my beautiful Mariners,

12:05.333 --> 12:07.509
but...

12:07.509 --> 12:10.425
Well, my wife's getting
pretty good at faking it, so...

12:10.425 --> 12:12.122
That's a slippery slope.

12:13.689 --> 12:15.647
Damn, Agent Browning,
that's cold.

12:15.647 --> 12:17.693
I only work with
what you give me, Agent Carter.

12:19.869 --> 12:23.438
You beat that
numbers generator eight times.

12:23.438 --> 12:24.787
How'd you do that?

12:24.787 --> 12:26.571
I also missed it eight times.

12:26.571 --> 12:27.964
Hmm.

12:30.184 --> 12:32.708
Half-psychic is better
than not psychic at all,

12:32.708 --> 12:34.188
I'd say.

12:39.193 --> 12:41.195
Family of four
lived in that house

12:41.195 --> 12:42.413
for 12 years.

12:42.413 --> 12:43.458
The Horns.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.025
Nice people.

12:45.025 --> 12:47.767
Dad taught college,
coached T-ball.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.073
Mom ran the church bake sale,

12:50.073 --> 12:52.336
and then, two months ago,

12:52.336 --> 12:54.164
they all get murdered inside.

12:54.164 --> 12:55.470
Four victims,

12:55.470 --> 12:57.167
but technically three murders
and a suicide.

12:58.125 --> 12:59.822
The father?

12:59.822 --> 13:01.998
Yeah, he didn't do it
halfway, either.

13:01.998 --> 13:04.305
Stabbed his wife 61 times

13:04.305 --> 13:06.481
before the blade
snapped off the handle.

13:09.266 --> 13:11.312
What about the kids?

13:11.312 --> 13:13.270
What about 'em?

13:13.270 --> 13:14.663
How many wounds?

13:17.579 --> 13:19.276
You can read about it
in the file.

13:20.930 --> 13:23.759
You said four were murdered.

13:23.759 --> 13:24.847
I don't understand.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.153
Neither do we.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.851
A letter was left
with the bodies,

13:28.851 --> 13:30.374
written in a coded alphabet,

13:30.374 --> 13:31.723
and not in the hand of anyone

13:31.723 --> 13:33.769
in any way
connected to the family.

13:33.769 --> 13:35.162
So...

13:35.162 --> 13:37.642
We have ten letters like it,

13:37.642 --> 13:38.992
made by the same hand.

13:38.992 --> 13:44.040
Ten houses, ten families,
over the past 30 years,

13:44.040 --> 13:47.304
and all of them signed
with one word...

13:47.304 --> 13:49.350
"Longlegs".

13:49.350 --> 13:53.093
Someone or something
is making the fathers do it.

13:53.093 --> 13:56.923
So far, we've been goddamned
to figure out what or who.

14:01.492 --> 14:03.364
I'm telling you,
she's not ready for this.

14:05.322 --> 14:06.715
You got a better idea, Browning,

14:06.715 --> 14:09.196
then you can run with it.

14:15.637 --> 14:17.030
There you go, Harker,

14:17.030 --> 14:19.467
take a nice long look.

14:24.298 --> 14:25.865
Tell me your version

14:25.865 --> 14:28.345
of what happened in Colfax
with the shooting of Agent Fisk.

14:30.739 --> 14:32.959
It's hard to explain, sir.

14:32.959 --> 14:35.265
It's like something
tapping me on the shoulder,

14:35.265 --> 14:36.658
telling me where to look.

14:38.225 --> 14:40.488
You identified
a suspect's house,

14:40.488 --> 14:41.881
with no prior knowledge,

14:41.881 --> 14:43.926
no real indication
that it was any way different

14:43.926 --> 14:46.973
than all the cookie-cutters
all around it.

14:46.973 --> 14:48.670
Anything like that
ever happen to you before,

14:48.670 --> 14:50.933
Agent Harker?

14:50.933 --> 14:53.327
From time to time, sir.

14:53.327 --> 14:58.419
Well, maybe we'll just
call you "highly intuitive".

14:58.419 --> 15:00.987
Yes, sir.

15:00.987 --> 15:02.379
Uh-huh.

15:14.130 --> 15:15.827
Tell me what you see.

15:15.827 --> 15:17.655
What do the families
have in common?

15:19.440 --> 15:21.921
That's a good question.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.226
All the victim families

15:23.226 --> 15:25.576
have daughters
whose birthdays are on the 14th

15:25.576 --> 15:27.187
of any given month.

15:30.103 --> 15:31.887
But only the Horns

15:31.887 --> 15:33.802
were actually murdered
on that date.

15:37.110 --> 15:39.025
Get to work.

16:00.176 --> 16:02.178
<i>9-1-1.
What's your emergency?</i>

16:04.093 --> 16:06.008
<i>It's...</i>

16:06.008 --> 16:07.749
<i>It's my daughter.</i>

16:10.056 --> 16:13.015
<i>It's...
it's not my daughter...</i>

16:13.015 --> 16:15.713
<i>Sir, who's not your daughter?</i>

16:15.713 --> 16:17.237
<i>I gotta be quiet.</i>

16:19.021 --> 16:20.718
<i>I've gotta be quiet.</i>

16:20.718 --> 16:21.981
<i>Sir, where are you?</i>

16:22.807 --> 16:24.635
<i>When she's sleeping...</i>

16:25.723 --> 16:26.986
<i>When she's sleeping,</i>

16:26.986 --> 16:28.813
<i>it's the best time to do it.</i>

16:30.032 --> 16:31.077
<i>Do what?</i>

16:31.077 --> 16:33.688
<i>When her eyes are closed.</i>

16:33.688 --> 16:35.907
<i>Sir, can you
stay on the line with me?</i>

16:40.564 --> 16:42.262
<i>Sir?</i>

16:43.567 --> 16:45.395
<i>Hello?</i>

16:45.395 --> 16:47.397
<i>Can you stay on the line?</i>

16:47.397 --> 16:49.399
<i>Sir?</i>

16:55.797 --> 16:57.929
<i>9-1-1. What is your emergency?</i>

17:05.415 --> 17:06.938
<i>Help!</i>

17:32.094 --> 17:34.053
Harker!

17:39.362 --> 17:42.278
You know, there's such a thing
as looking too long.

17:46.587 --> 17:48.328
I must have lost track of time.

17:51.287 --> 17:53.724
I'm still thirsty.

17:53.724 --> 17:54.986
Are you thirsty?

17:54.986 --> 17:56.423
Come on, let's go for a drink.

17:56.423 --> 17:59.034
You'll have to excuse me, I...

17:59.034 --> 18:00.383
it's late, and I don't drink.

18:00.383 --> 18:01.776
You don't drink, you're right.

18:01.776 --> 18:03.212
I'll drink

18:03.212 --> 18:05.345
while you tell me things.

18:05.345 --> 18:07.695
Agent Harker.

18:07.695 --> 18:09.697
Come on, bag it up!

18:15.398 --> 18:17.748
Ah, thanks, Melissa.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.578
Go ahead, Harker.

18:23.841 --> 18:27.584
Well, there's no signs
of forced entry.

18:27.584 --> 18:29.108
In fact, forensics says

18:29.108 --> 18:32.720
there's no indication
he was ever in the house at all.

18:32.720 --> 18:34.417
There's only the bodies
of the victims,

18:34.417 --> 18:35.549
and they've all been killed

18:35.549 --> 18:37.420
with something
from inside the house.

18:38.334 --> 18:39.596
Two times, a shotgun,

18:39.596 --> 18:42.164
both legally registered
to the father.

18:42.164 --> 18:44.732
Eight times, a knife
from the family's kitchen.

18:44.732 --> 18:46.864
Once, a hammer
from the family's toolbox.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.040
All right.

18:49.040 --> 18:50.303
And...?

18:50.303 --> 18:51.739
Longlegs would have to be
inside the house

18:51.739 --> 18:55.003
to use the shotgun,
the knife, the hammer,

18:55.003 --> 18:56.744
but according
to physical evidence,

18:56.744 --> 18:59.138
he never is.

18:59.138 --> 19:01.096
If it wasn't for the letters
he left behind,

19:01.096 --> 19:04.621
it's almost like
he was never there at all.

19:04.621 --> 19:06.710
He murders them,

19:06.710 --> 19:08.625
but not in person.

19:11.280 --> 19:16.155
Maybe he tells the families
what he wants them to do--

19:16.155 --> 19:18.940
to themselves, to each other--

19:18.940 --> 19:20.333
then they do it.

19:21.290 --> 19:22.552
Well, now, that...

19:22.552 --> 19:24.989
that reads
like a page out of Manson.

19:29.124 --> 19:31.866
Manson had accomplices.

19:31.866 --> 19:33.824
His Family.

19:33.824 --> 19:36.305
You think Longlegs has help?

19:38.525 --> 19:39.700
Hmm.

19:41.223 --> 19:42.616
All right.

19:43.747 --> 19:45.009
Mm!

19:45.009 --> 19:47.316
Oh, man.

19:48.752 --> 19:50.101
Whoo!

19:51.799 --> 19:54.889
Okay, bedtime.

19:54.889 --> 19:56.630
I'll drive.

20:03.158 --> 20:05.247
You take a left right here.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.557
And the lights are on.

20:10.557 --> 20:11.906
I'm busted.

20:14.996 --> 20:18.173
Well, all right, Harker,

20:18.173 --> 20:20.088
you get to come meet
my wife and kid.

20:20.088 --> 20:22.264
Um, sir...

20:22.264 --> 20:24.005
do I have to?

20:24.005 --> 20:25.354
Yeah.

20:35.843 --> 20:37.627
Come on in.

20:40.761 --> 20:41.849
Hey, there she is!

20:43.285 --> 20:45.418
You didn't call
to say goodnight.

20:45.418 --> 20:46.941
Oh, 'cause it was late,

20:46.941 --> 20:48.682
and it was past your bedtime.

20:48.682 --> 20:50.292
Well, now it's even later,

20:50.292 --> 20:52.729
and way, way past my bedtime.

20:52.729 --> 20:53.948
Uh, yeah.

20:53.948 --> 20:56.646
I guess I screwed that up, huh?

20:56.646 --> 20:57.995
Hello.

20:59.170 --> 21:01.085
Oh, hey,
this is, uh, Agent Lee Harker.

21:01.085 --> 21:03.436
Harker, this is
my beautiful wife, Anna,

21:03.436 --> 21:06.613
and our daughter, Miss Ruby.

21:06.613 --> 21:08.223
Nice to meet you, Harker.

21:09.050 --> 21:10.269
- Hi, honey.
- Hey, babe.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.706
I'm glad you're home.

21:12.706 --> 21:14.621
Do you want to see my room?

21:32.769 --> 21:34.641
What happened to this one?

21:35.206 --> 21:36.643
Its head got cut off,

21:36.643 --> 21:39.210
and I don't know where it is.

21:41.952 --> 21:44.999
I guess that's more my job...

21:44.999 --> 21:47.218
finding things, I mean.

21:53.224 --> 21:56.053
What about that thing,
do you go in it?

21:56.053 --> 21:58.186
It's too babyish.

21:58.186 --> 22:00.362
Dad says he wants to keep
some of my old stuff around

22:00.362 --> 22:01.972
so I don't grow up too fast,

22:01.972 --> 22:03.974
but I'm gonna grow up anyway.

22:03.974 --> 22:05.193
Even veals grow a little,

22:05.193 --> 22:06.803
and they live in a box

22:06.803 --> 22:09.153
with their legs all tied up
and everything.

22:11.547 --> 22:13.897
Veals have it pretty tough,
don't they?

22:17.118 --> 22:20.034
Did you wanna be an FBI agent
when you were a little girl?

22:23.167 --> 22:25.039
No.

22:25.039 --> 22:27.911
I actually
wanted to be an actress.

22:27.911 --> 22:30.566
That messes up kids.

22:31.828 --> 22:33.264
So they say.

22:36.093 --> 22:39.880
Is it scary
being a lady FBI agent?

22:43.100 --> 22:44.972
Yeah.

22:44.972 --> 22:47.061
Yeah, it is.

22:47.061 --> 22:48.758
All right, you two.

22:48.758 --> 22:49.890
I'm sure Agent Harker's got

22:49.890 --> 22:52.414
a lot of very important
work to do,

22:52.414 --> 22:55.591
and, Miss Ruby Carter, it's...

22:55.591 --> 22:57.854
Well, it's tomorrow.

22:57.854 --> 23:00.379
Can she come
to my birthday party?

23:03.251 --> 23:04.208
Sounds great to me.

23:04.208 --> 23:05.514
Why don't you ask her?

23:11.346 --> 23:13.174
I'll be there.

24:45.919 --> 24:47.355
<i>Yes?</i>

24:47.355 --> 24:48.487
<i>Hello?</i>

24:48.487 --> 24:50.053
Hi, Mom.

24:52.578 --> 24:54.144
<i>Lee?</i>

24:54.144 --> 24:56.756
Yup, still only me.

24:56.756 --> 24:58.801
Are you okay?

24:58.801 --> 25:01.238
<i>Yeah, spent the day at home.</i>

25:01.238 --> 25:03.153
<i>Where else would I be?</i>

25:06.548 --> 25:08.376
What are you doing
in the house?

25:08.376 --> 25:10.160
Do you have to let the phone
ring so long?

25:11.292 --> 25:14.382
<i>Trying to go through
some stuff over here.</i>

25:14.382 --> 25:16.340
<i>Are you okay?</i>

25:16.340 --> 25:17.994
Yeah, I'm okay.

25:19.039 --> 25:21.824
I just can't sleep.

25:21.824 --> 25:23.739
A lot on my mind.

25:23.739 --> 25:25.524
Work stuff.

25:26.960 --> 25:29.353
<i>Nasty stuff?</i>

25:34.445 --> 25:37.666
Um, yeah.

25:39.668 --> 25:43.106
<i>Want to tell me about it?</i>

25:43.106 --> 25:44.238
No...

25:44.238 --> 25:45.674
No.

25:48.111 --> 25:52.289
<i>Don't forget
I was a nurse for eight years.</i>

25:52.289 --> 25:56.555
<i>I saw more than my
fair share of nasty stuff.</i>

25:58.034 --> 26:00.471
I think I just need to be quiet
for a little bit.

26:03.300 --> 26:06.173
<i>Somebody's birthday's
coming up.</i>

26:15.791 --> 26:18.577
<i>Honey? Are you still there?</i>

26:21.667 --> 26:22.711
Mom, I gotta go.

26:22.711 --> 26:24.757
I-I'll call you back, okay?

27:02.011 --> 27:03.056
Hello?

30:45.278 --> 30:46.540
<i>Hello,</i>

30:46.540 --> 30:48.716
<i>no one is available
to take your call.</i>

30:48.716 --> 30:50.936
<i>Please leave a message
after the tone.</i>

30:52.720 --> 30:54.200
<i>Lee?</i>

30:54.200 --> 30:56.942
<i>Are you there?</i>

30:56.942 --> 30:58.813
<i>Call me back.</i>

31:22.097 --> 31:23.794
Yes, Mom, I'm fine.

31:23.794 --> 31:26.058
<i>Harker?
Carter's looking for you.</i>

31:26.058 --> 31:28.147
Um, yeah, I'll be right in.

31:41.595 --> 31:43.771
Can you have a look at this?

32:10.711 --> 32:11.799
Him again.

32:14.062 --> 32:16.369
We are real late on this one.

32:16.369 --> 32:18.675
Looks like the family
was planning a trip.

32:18.675 --> 32:20.068
A friend assumed they'd gone,

32:20.068 --> 32:22.984
so no one bothered
to check in on 'em.

32:22.984 --> 32:24.768
Found plane tickets
for Los Angeles

32:24.768 --> 32:27.206
and reservations for Disneyland.

32:27.206 --> 32:29.077
Sounds like a nice idea.

32:30.296 --> 32:32.689
And the girl's birthday
was the 14th?

32:32.689 --> 32:34.822
Seems like it.

32:42.569 --> 32:45.224
How'd you figure that out?

32:45.224 --> 32:47.313
I only looked
long enough, sir.

32:49.532 --> 32:51.752
Yeah, well,

32:51.752 --> 32:54.320
there's a dead family
in the master bedroom,

32:54.320 --> 32:57.323
so let's go
take a long look at that.

33:03.285 --> 33:05.679
We found dad in the garage.

33:05.679 --> 33:06.854
Wrists and throat,

33:06.854 --> 33:09.248
kitchen knife in his hand.

33:09.248 --> 33:10.423
His wounds look self-inflicted,

33:10.423 --> 33:11.990
but we'll be sure
when we're sure.

33:14.427 --> 33:17.778
This is everyone else here,

33:17.778 --> 33:20.128
and it's not great.

33:20.128 --> 33:21.521
How long ago?

33:21.521 --> 33:22.826
I'd say about a month.

33:22.826 --> 33:23.958
Jesus.

33:25.612 --> 33:26.613
Okay.

33:26.613 --> 33:28.484
Let's take a look.

33:28.484 --> 33:29.920
Are you sure she--

33:29.920 --> 33:31.966
Yeah, she's good. You're good,
aren't you, Harker?

33:33.489 --> 33:35.187
Pull it.

33:44.848 --> 33:46.633
How old's the girl?

33:47.895 --> 33:50.593
I'm guessing nine or ten.

33:51.681 --> 33:53.031
Fuck.

34:10.613 --> 34:12.311
<i>Yes, who is it?</i>

34:12.311 --> 34:13.834
Hi, Mom.

34:14.878 --> 34:17.403
<i>Lee?</i>

34:17.403 --> 34:18.708
Yes.

34:18.708 --> 34:20.623
Still your only daughter.

34:29.110 --> 34:30.764
Anyways, I was calling
to let you know

34:30.764 --> 34:32.461
that I'm gonna busy now,

34:32.461 --> 34:33.854
with work,

34:33.854 --> 34:36.770
and I probably
won't be able to make it.

34:36.770 --> 34:37.988
I want to, it's just--

34:43.603 --> 34:45.213
Mom, are you still there?

34:46.736 --> 34:49.130
<i>Be careful
they don't work you too hard,</i>

34:49.130 --> 34:50.262
<i>all right?</i>

34:50.262 --> 34:52.829
Yeah, but it's good.

34:52.829 --> 34:54.527
It's really good.

34:54.527 --> 34:56.529
They put me on
something important.

34:56.529 --> 34:57.704
<i>Yeah?</i>

34:57.704 --> 34:59.836
<i>What is it?</i>

34:59.836 --> 35:02.056
Well, I can't tell you.

35:02.056 --> 35:03.710
You wouldn't
wanna hear about it anyways.

35:03.710 --> 35:06.147
<i>Not nice things.</i>

35:06.147 --> 35:09.846
I don't think the Bureau
has a division for nice things.

35:11.413 --> 35:14.895
<i>Will I see you
on your birthday next week?</i>

35:18.333 --> 35:20.118
I'll try.

35:20.118 --> 35:21.858
<i>Lee?</i>

35:21.858 --> 35:24.426
<i>Are you still saying
your prayers?</i>

35:24.426 --> 35:25.384
Yeah.

35:25.384 --> 35:26.515
Listen I gotta go.

35:26.515 --> 35:28.082
<i>Lee, honey,</i>

35:28.082 --> 35:31.390
<i>our prayers protect us
from the Devil.</i>

35:31.390 --> 35:33.218
I know.

35:33.218 --> 35:36.003
I know, Mom.

35:36.003 --> 35:38.092
I'll call you later, okay?

37:38.604 --> 37:39.866
Help me out here.

37:42.303 --> 37:44.262
It's an algorithm.

37:45.741 --> 37:48.570
His algorithm.

37:49.919 --> 37:52.095
Help me out more.

37:54.141 --> 37:57.623
The first murder happens
on July 14th, 1966.

37:57.623 --> 38:00.582
The rest occur within six days
of the daughters' birthdays,

38:00.582 --> 38:01.975
either before or after...

38:04.543 --> 38:06.849
...creating
an inverted triangle.

38:10.113 --> 38:12.202
Okay, what am I
supposed to do with this?

38:12.202 --> 38:14.335
I also decoded
all his letters.

38:14.335 --> 38:15.336
The one thing that stood out

38:15.336 --> 38:16.816
was the repeated reference

38:16.816 --> 38:19.514
to "the fine time we had
at the Camera family farm,"

38:19.514 --> 38:21.951
where X's mark the spot.

38:23.997 --> 38:25.346
The Camera family.

38:26.434 --> 38:28.567
I was at Georgetown
when that happened.

38:28.567 --> 38:31.091
Their local priest
makes his weekly visit,

38:31.091 --> 38:32.701
but it goes bad,

38:32.701 --> 38:35.574
due to Carrie Anne's father
and the axe from the toolshed.

38:35.574 --> 38:38.316
He kills the priest, his wife,
and then himself.

38:38.316 --> 38:40.535
Carrie Anne's at school,
so she survives.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.017
Look at the date.

38:44.017 --> 38:45.323
March 8th.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.890
Now look at
Carrie Anne's birthday.

38:50.719 --> 38:53.026
March 14th.

38:53.026 --> 38:55.071
Six days apart.

38:55.071 --> 38:56.943
Well, no shit.

38:56.943 --> 39:00.686
I believe Longlegs was
at the Camera family farm,

39:00.686 --> 39:03.776
and it's possible
that Carrie Anne saw him.

39:06.039 --> 39:07.954
What about the 13th?

39:07.954 --> 39:09.912
It's missing.

39:09.912 --> 39:12.654
I'm still not sure about that,

39:12.654 --> 39:14.482
but it's three days from now.

39:14.482 --> 39:17.050
Maybe Longlegs will kill again.

39:17.050 --> 39:19.182
And this Carrie Anne,
she still alive?

39:19.182 --> 39:21.576
Water Rock
Psychiatric Hospital.

39:21.576 --> 39:22.708
That's not far from here.

39:22.708 --> 39:23.970
132 miles, sir.

39:23.970 --> 39:24.927
And the old farm?

39:24.927 --> 39:26.886
89.

39:26.886 --> 39:28.061
Let's start there.

40:17.197 --> 40:18.720
It's over there.

40:55.801 --> 40:57.759
Xs mark the spot.

42:21.843 --> 42:23.671
Carter?

42:23.671 --> 42:24.933
Yeah?

44:26.751 --> 44:29.449
She's handmade,
that's for sure.

44:29.449 --> 44:31.799
and beautifully handmade
at that.

44:31.799 --> 44:33.671
Porcelain head, hands and feet,

44:33.671 --> 44:35.194
unbleached canvas body,

44:35.194 --> 44:36.935
cotton stuffing.

44:36.935 --> 44:40.329
The hair is human,
what's left of it.

44:40.329 --> 44:42.505
All in all,
it's beautifully made,

44:42.505 --> 44:44.507
by a highly-skilled craftsman.

44:44.507 --> 44:45.813
But what about the ball there?

44:45.813 --> 44:47.032
Mm.

44:47.032 --> 44:48.642
It was inside the head.

44:48.642 --> 44:51.253
So I've been calling it
the "brain".

44:51.253 --> 44:54.343
It's hollow,
empty of object or matter,

44:54.343 --> 44:55.562
but listen...

45:28.073 --> 45:31.990
And what's your name,
little angel?

45:34.079 --> 45:38.518
Nice to meet you, Carrie Anne.

45:38.518 --> 45:40.041
Now...

45:40.041 --> 45:42.565
I know you're not afraid

45:42.565 --> 45:45.090
of a little bit of dark...

45:46.395 --> 45:50.095
...because you are the dark.

46:03.064 --> 46:04.326
The other night,
I could have sworn

46:04.326 --> 46:05.937
it was whispering
my ex-wife's name

46:05.937 --> 46:07.590
over and over again,

46:07.590 --> 46:08.983
but...

46:08.983 --> 46:10.506
I've been working very late,

46:10.506 --> 46:11.769
and of course it--it wasn't.

46:13.074 --> 46:15.947
Yeah, can the--
Can the "brain" be opened up?

46:15.947 --> 46:17.383
Of course,

46:17.383 --> 46:18.601
but it's not likely

46:18.601 --> 46:20.342
there's a solution
to your case in there,

46:20.342 --> 46:22.475
because
there's nothing in there.

46:25.130 --> 46:26.696
Well,

46:26.696 --> 46:29.482
let's go see Carrie Anne Camera
at the mental hospital.

47:41.684 --> 47:43.425
Can I help you
with anything else today?

47:48.517 --> 47:50.171
Cuckoo.

47:50.171 --> 47:52.913
Cuckoo. Cuckoo.

47:52.913 --> 47:54.567
Cuckoo.

47:56.134 --> 47:58.658
I don't know what that
was supposed to be.

48:00.660 --> 48:05.186
And what day is your birthday,
little angel?

48:08.189 --> 48:09.408
Daddy!

48:09.408 --> 48:12.498
That gross guy is back again!

48:23.988 --> 48:27.252
Daddy!

48:27.252 --> 48:29.907
Mommy!

48:29.907 --> 48:32.648
Unmake me!

48:32.648 --> 48:34.868
And save me

48:34.868 --> 48:39.568
from the hell of living!

48:42.745 --> 48:46.793
Two days ago, Carrie Anne
is postcard catatonic.

48:46.793 --> 48:48.664
Well, slumped in a chair
by the door

48:48.664 --> 48:50.275
for as long as I've been here,

48:50.275 --> 48:52.581
and I've been here eight years.

48:52.581 --> 48:55.671
Then yesterday,
she gets a visitor,

48:55.671 --> 48:57.543
and I've never seen
that happen either,

48:57.543 --> 49:00.633
and like someone
flipped a switch

49:00.633 --> 49:02.026
on the back of her head,

49:02.026 --> 49:05.812
and all of a sudden,
she's right there.

49:05.812 --> 49:06.987
Wide awake,

49:06.987 --> 49:08.684
eyes bright.

49:08.684 --> 49:10.208
You saw this visitor?

49:10.208 --> 49:13.994
No, I wasn't on site
at the time, unfortunately,

49:13.994 --> 49:15.778
but the log should say.

49:28.008 --> 49:29.575
Does the guard check IDs?

49:31.533 --> 49:36.103
Well, it does sound like
a good idea, but no.

49:36.103 --> 49:38.410
No, we do not require that.

49:47.027 --> 49:48.681
Thank you, Carrie Anne,

49:48.681 --> 49:50.857
for taking the time
to talk to me today.

49:54.469 --> 49:56.732
I've seen you before,

49:57.995 --> 49:59.257
ain't I?

50:01.259 --> 50:02.912
I don't think so.

50:06.133 --> 50:09.093
You...

50:09.093 --> 50:11.399
been to my house...

50:15.360 --> 50:19.190
...or someone s'looks s'lots
like you, anyways.

50:22.454 --> 50:24.760
How are you feeling today,
Carrie Anne?

50:27.111 --> 50:28.808
Mm...

50:30.201 --> 50:32.159
...different.

50:34.074 --> 50:36.903
It's like...

50:36.903 --> 50:40.080
a long dream...

50:42.169 --> 50:45.564
...and so dark.

50:45.564 --> 50:47.609
A world of dark.

50:50.482 --> 50:53.920
Like a nowhere

50:53.920 --> 50:56.401
'tween here and there.

50:58.229 --> 50:59.969
What's that called?

51:02.711 --> 51:04.800
Doin' the limbo?

51:06.585 --> 51:08.369
And before...

51:08.369 --> 51:11.111
the long dream,

51:11.111 --> 51:13.461
do you remember anything?

51:13.461 --> 51:15.594
Do you remember coming here?

51:17.161 --> 51:19.598
Do you remember your parents?

51:32.176 --> 51:36.180
They didn't a'know
what to do with themselves.

51:40.097 --> 51:41.533
I mean...

51:41.533 --> 51:44.753
gosh, and I knew
I was a handful as it were's.

51:50.150 --> 51:51.978
Momma always hated me,

51:51.978 --> 51:55.329
'cause how I'd come out wrongly
when I was borned.

51:59.203 --> 52:00.726
Bled her up too much.

52:20.833 --> 52:22.878
Poppa was a good man.

52:25.403 --> 52:28.101
That's the somethin'
I remember good.

52:34.063 --> 52:36.414
That's why he done it.

53:25.767 --> 53:28.205
You had a visitor yesterday.

53:31.512 --> 53:33.253
Can you describe him for me?

53:36.082 --> 53:38.954
Gosh, I don't ever
wanna forget 'im.

53:40.434 --> 53:43.350
I was jus' waitin' on him
to come and get me.

53:44.786 --> 53:48.225
To come and tells me
somethin's to do for 'im.

53:48.225 --> 53:50.792
Or even better,

53:50.792 --> 53:55.319
to do somethin' for
the Man Down The Stairs,

53:55.319 --> 53:59.366
and, boy, I just wanna do
whatsever-so he says me to do.

54:00.541 --> 54:02.891
Like, if'n he told me
to take a jumpy out a window,

54:02.891 --> 54:05.764
I'd surely do.

54:05.764 --> 54:07.113
Just happy as peaches

54:07.113 --> 54:10.421
to watch the ground
as it come up to meet me.

54:14.120 --> 54:15.730
Or if'n he told me

54:15.730 --> 54:17.732
to kill you right-right here
in this room with my bare hand,

54:17.732 --> 54:19.256
I'd surely do.

54:22.302 --> 54:23.912
Just happy as peaches

54:23.912 --> 54:27.307
to watch your heavy heart
go pop-pop,

54:27.307 --> 54:29.788
and your eyeses
to go all to blood.

54:36.664 --> 54:39.667
Do you remember having a doll?

54:40.842 --> 54:43.715
A special doll
that looked just like you?

54:43.715 --> 54:45.586
Nope.

54:48.154 --> 54:51.810
And you don't remember neither,

54:51.810 --> 54:55.466
you dirtsy, flirtsy
ol' angel bitch.

55:38.987 --> 55:40.075
A'ight, a'ight,

55:40.075 --> 55:43.383
so he murders a family in '75,

55:43.383 --> 55:44.645
but he probably isn't even
in the house

55:44.645 --> 55:46.081
when they're killed.

55:46.081 --> 55:48.083
Then comes back
almost 20 years later

55:48.083 --> 55:49.955
to visit the only survivor,

55:49.955 --> 55:51.565
signs in
as the agent chasing him,

55:51.565 --> 55:53.654
and then leaves
his only surviving victim

55:53.654 --> 55:55.482
feeling much, much better

55:55.482 --> 55:57.702
than before he got there.

55:58.659 --> 56:00.357
Mm.

56:00.357 --> 56:03.838
She came out of her catatonia
the same day we found the doll.

56:03.838 --> 56:05.927
Yeah, that couldn't be
anything but a coincidence.

56:06.841 --> 56:09.104
Look, we opened the ball
in the doll's head,

56:09.104 --> 56:10.410
and there's nothing inside.

56:10.410 --> 56:12.325
Maybe we're missing something.

56:13.718 --> 56:15.546
Something that...

56:15.546 --> 56:18.418
I don't know, makes it work.

56:18.418 --> 56:20.986
In some cultures,
dolls are used in magic,

56:20.986 --> 56:22.901
to control people.

56:22.901 --> 56:25.860
So, he kills them with a doll
from somewhere else

56:25.860 --> 56:27.993
by what, remote control?

56:29.168 --> 56:32.345
Longlegs is just a man, Harker,
not a witch doctor.

56:35.870 --> 56:37.263
Sit down.

56:44.226 --> 56:48.230
How does Longlegs
know your name, Harker?

56:49.188 --> 56:51.582
I don't know, sir.

56:51.582 --> 56:52.539
You know, last week,

56:52.539 --> 56:55.281
this investigation is ice-cold.

56:55.281 --> 56:56.630
Then you come on to it,

56:56.630 --> 56:59.633
and all of a sudden,
it's flowing like...

56:59.633 --> 57:02.506
I don't know, hot lava.

57:04.159 --> 57:05.813
What aren't you telling me?

57:13.734 --> 57:17.042
I revisited your file.

57:17.042 --> 57:19.610
When was the last time
you talked to your mother?

57:26.007 --> 57:27.313
Sorry, sir,

57:27.313 --> 57:30.142
but what does that
have to do with the case?

57:31.709 --> 57:33.711
She called in a police report,

57:33.711 --> 57:36.496
January 13, 1974.

57:36.496 --> 57:38.716
That's one day
before your 9th birthday.

57:38.716 --> 57:40.935
That makes your birthday

57:40.935 --> 57:42.589
the 14th.

57:45.200 --> 57:46.245
She did?

57:46.245 --> 57:48.508
She did.

57:48.508 --> 57:50.815
Gave a description
of a trespasser.

57:50.815 --> 57:53.774
Tall and pale.

57:53.774 --> 57:56.168
Harker...

57:56.168 --> 57:57.822
look at me.

58:02.130 --> 58:06.178
Do you remember someone
at your house

58:06.178 --> 58:07.571
that might have looked that way?

58:08.615 --> 58:10.225
I don't know, sir.

58:15.100 --> 58:17.406
You go see your mother,

58:17.406 --> 58:18.712
and tell me what she says

58:18.712 --> 58:20.453
about the person
who came to your house

58:20.453 --> 58:22.107
when you were a kid, understood?

58:22.107 --> 58:23.761
Yes, sir.

59:18.642 --> 59:20.557
Hi, Mom.

59:27.085 --> 59:28.652
Mm.

59:38.662 --> 59:40.751
Will you tell me
the honest truth

59:40.751 --> 59:42.579
about something?

59:44.145 --> 59:46.583
I'll try.

59:46.583 --> 59:49.194
Do you still say your prayers?

59:52.414 --> 59:54.416
No, Mom.

59:54.416 --> 59:57.463
I never said my prayers,
never once.

59:57.463 --> 59:59.117
They scared me.

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:15.133
Ah...

01:00:19.137 --> 01:00:20.704
What's so funny?

01:00:20.704 --> 01:00:21.879
You're right.

01:00:23.315 --> 01:00:26.448
All our prayers don't help us.

01:00:28.929 --> 01:00:31.889
Prayers don't do
a goddamn thing.

01:00:37.068 --> 01:00:39.679
I'm gonna make you
something to eat.

01:01:03.137 --> 01:01:04.922
Jesus Christ, Mom.

01:01:38.607 --> 01:01:40.348
Good news.

01:01:40.348 --> 01:01:44.222
I got Deborah
to cover my shift tomorrow,

01:01:44.222 --> 01:01:47.268
and it's somebody's birthday.

01:02:51.376 --> 01:02:53.073
Lee?

01:03:02.822 --> 01:03:07.392
I can't believe it's gonna be
your birthday again so soon.

01:03:09.655 --> 01:03:11.613
What a day that was.

01:03:12.745 --> 01:03:14.616
I bled...

01:03:14.616 --> 01:03:17.228
bled... bled...

01:03:17.228 --> 01:03:18.055
bled...

01:03:18.055 --> 01:03:18.838
bled--

01:03:18.838 --> 01:03:20.405
Mom.

01:03:22.581 --> 01:03:24.888
Do you remember
my 9th birthday?

01:03:36.900 --> 01:03:38.815
No, I don't think so.

01:03:42.514 --> 01:03:43.994
I don't remember anything.

01:03:43.994 --> 01:03:45.778
Do you?

01:03:53.394 --> 01:03:55.614
What happened that day?

01:03:56.833 --> 01:03:58.486
No.

01:04:01.228 --> 01:04:02.664
What do you mean, "no"?

01:04:08.105 --> 01:04:10.498
"No" is just
the way it sounds, baby girl.

01:04:10.498 --> 01:04:12.892
But you called the police,

01:04:12.892 --> 01:04:14.807
about a trespasser.

01:04:16.940 --> 01:04:20.465
No one ever came to visit us.

01:04:20.465 --> 01:04:22.946
Not any family.

01:04:22.946 --> 01:04:25.035
No strangers.

01:04:25.035 --> 01:04:27.385
No big, bad wolves.

01:04:27.385 --> 01:04:29.082
No anybody.

01:04:30.910 --> 01:04:33.782
But these are things
a little girl shouldn't know.

01:04:33.782 --> 01:04:36.263
I'm not a child anymore, Mom.

01:04:37.482 --> 01:04:39.049
You're not a child

01:04:39.049 --> 01:04:41.921
because you were allowed
to grow up.

01:04:41.921 --> 01:04:42.966
Allowed?

01:04:42.966 --> 01:04:45.620
This is a cruel world.

01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:48.667
Especially
for the little things.

01:04:48.667 --> 01:04:50.408
Not all of them
are allowed to live.

01:04:50.408 --> 01:04:51.844
What are you talking about?

01:04:51.844 --> 01:04:55.021
I might have forgotten
everything I possibly could,

01:04:55.021 --> 01:04:56.980
for both of our sakes,

01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:59.634
but I never threw
anything away.

01:05:01.462 --> 01:05:03.203
All of your things...

01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:07.251
...it's all in your room.

01:07:05.369 --> 01:07:08.111
Cheese and crackers!

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:12.854

01:07:15.857 --> 01:07:16.902
Excuse me.

Who are you,

01:07:18.121 --> 01:07:20.210

to my kid?

01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:10.869
What's this?

01:08:10.869 --> 01:08:13.828
It's him.

01:08:13.828 --> 01:08:15.526
It's him how?

01:08:15.526 --> 01:08:19.138
I found it in a box of photos
at my house.

01:08:19.138 --> 01:08:22.185
You really
don't remember this guy?

01:08:23.577 --> 01:08:25.318
Okay.

01:08:25.318 --> 01:08:27.581

to bring her in,

01:08:36.242 --> 01:08:38.114
I'm sure.

For how long?

01:11:30.373 --> 01:11:32.157
24 minutes.

01:11:32.157 --> 01:11:33.506
A'ight, everyone out of here.

01:11:33.506 --> 01:11:35.465
Browning, Harker, you stay.

01:11:35.465 --> 01:11:38.555
Go.
You guys go.

01:11:41.645 --> 01:11:43.647
His luggage was stuffed
with notebooks

01:11:43.647 --> 01:11:45.170
filled with handwriting.

01:11:45.170 --> 01:11:47.955
Handwriting that matches
the letters found at the scene,

01:11:47.955 --> 01:11:52.220
and, suffice to say,
it's all heavily Satanic.

01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:53.831
Agent Harker,

01:11:53.831 --> 01:11:57.095
while the Bureau does appreciate
your contribution here,

01:11:57.095 --> 01:11:59.706
it also puts us
in an odd position.

01:12:00.751 --> 01:12:02.709
So far,
there's no physical evidence

01:12:02.709 --> 01:12:05.059
that Kobble has ever
killed anyone.

01:12:05.059 --> 01:12:07.192
I mean, he worships the Devil,
that's for sure,

01:12:07.192 --> 01:12:09.542
but in the United States
of America,

01:12:09.542 --> 01:12:11.544
he's allowed to do that.

01:12:11.544 --> 01:12:13.067
I'm more concerned
about the fact

01:12:13.067 --> 01:12:16.114
that he knows who you are,
Agent Harker.

01:12:16.114 --> 01:12:17.550
But...

01:12:17.550 --> 01:12:19.073
he can't do anything else
about that

01:12:19.073 --> 01:12:21.685
now that we have him.

01:12:21.685 --> 01:12:24.905
"And I stood upon
the sand of the sea,

01:12:24.905 --> 01:12:27.560
and I saw a Beast rise up
out of the sea,

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.171
with seven heads and ten horns.

01:12:30.171 --> 01:12:33.131
And on his horns,
he wore ten crowns,

01:12:33.131 --> 01:12:35.176
and on each head was written
the blasphemous name."

01:12:35.176 --> 01:12:37.135
Book of Revelations, isn't it?

01:12:37.135 --> 01:12:38.528
Revelation.

01:12:38.528 --> 01:12:40.356
There's no "S".
It's singular.

01:12:42.227 --> 01:12:44.708
Longlegs isn't alone.

01:12:44.708 --> 01:12:47.624
He has to have someone
helping him.

01:12:47.624 --> 01:12:50.148
Maybe multiple, but it...

01:12:50.148 --> 01:12:51.367
it has to be someone

01:12:51.367 --> 01:12:52.716
that the families
felt comfortable

01:12:52.716 --> 01:12:54.413
letting into their house.

01:12:54.413 --> 01:12:57.285
Someone they know,
or have met before.

01:12:57.285 --> 01:13:00.680
Maybe a child, or...

01:13:00.680 --> 01:13:02.029
someone that could pass
as a child.

01:13:02.029 --> 01:13:03.727
A'ight, Harker, come on.

01:13:03.727 --> 01:13:06.382
We got the guy
who wrote the letters,

01:13:06.382 --> 01:13:07.644
and if we do this right,

01:13:07.644 --> 01:13:09.602
he'll spend
the rest of his life in jail.

01:13:09.602 --> 01:13:11.735
But it's not over.

01:13:13.127 --> 01:13:14.477
The triangle isn't complete,

01:13:14.477 --> 01:13:16.174
we're still missing the 13th.

01:13:16.174 --> 01:13:18.959
The 13th is today,
Agent Harker.

01:13:18.959 --> 01:13:21.440
What are we supposed to do
about that?

01:13:21.440 --> 01:13:24.182
We can expect his accomplice

01:13:24.182 --> 01:13:26.706
to kill at least
one more family...

01:13:29.448 --> 01:13:31.624
...and Kobble's the only one
who knows who that is.

01:13:39.240 --> 01:13:40.720
Kobble...

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:43.244
where is he now?

01:13:43.244 --> 01:13:45.159
He's downstairs.

01:13:45.159 --> 01:13:47.466
Right under your feet.

01:13:53.037 --> 01:13:55.866
I'm a friend of a friend.

01:13:55.866 --> 01:13:57.650
What friend?

01:13:57.650 --> 01:14:00.044
My friend.

01:14:00.044 --> 01:14:02.133
That lives downstairs.

01:14:03.090 --> 01:14:04.352
Downstairs?

01:14:04.352 --> 01:14:06.311
Downstairs from where?

01:14:06.311 --> 01:14:08.792
Everywheres.

01:14:08.792 --> 01:14:13.710
You can even call him
"Mr. Downstairs".

01:14:40.388 --> 01:14:42.260
Oh...

01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:46.394
there she is!

01:14:47.526 --> 01:14:50.877
The Almost Birthday Girl.

01:14:56.013 --> 01:14:58.319
Oh...

01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.503
It's funny.

01:15:09.113 --> 01:15:12.769
The day you decided
to go into law enforcement,

01:15:12.769 --> 01:15:15.119
you were...

01:15:15.119 --> 01:15:16.555
20.

01:15:18.905 --> 01:15:21.865
We had such a big laugh
about it.

01:15:24.694 --> 01:15:28.262
Although, it was only me
who laughed, not she.

01:15:30.134 --> 01:15:34.268
Who is the "she"
that you're talking about?

01:15:34.268 --> 01:15:36.880
The seventh "she".

01:15:36.880 --> 01:15:41.406
To be given the same choice
that they've all been given.

01:15:41.406 --> 01:15:43.451
Crimson or clover.

01:15:45.453 --> 01:15:49.980
Accept the gift,
and destroy it,

01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:52.678
and destroy yourself,

01:15:52.678 --> 01:15:55.420
and your selves,

01:15:55.420 --> 01:15:57.335
or keep it,

01:15:57.335 --> 01:15:59.380
and bow down.

01:16:01.513 --> 01:16:06.083
Bow all the way down,

01:16:06.083 --> 01:16:08.912
and get right down

01:16:08.912 --> 01:16:13.307
to the dirty, dirty work.

01:16:13.307 --> 01:16:18.530
Work that gets dirty
as it cleans.

01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:21.359
Like a mop.

01:16:21.359 --> 01:16:25.276
Like a ra... ag.

01:16:27.017 --> 01:16:29.410
But...

01:16:29.410 --> 01:16:31.935
you don't work alone, do you?

01:16:34.502 --> 01:16:36.374
Someone's been helping you.

01:16:39.638 --> 01:16:41.988
An accomplice.

01:16:44.164 --> 01:16:47.646
Knock-knock,
on the farmhouse door.

01:16:47.646 --> 01:16:51.302
A nice lady with a Bible
and a, "Congratulations!

01:16:51.302 --> 01:16:53.260
You have been selected.

01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:56.307
You may now collect
your gift from the church."

01:16:56.307 --> 01:16:58.526
It says it right here,

01:16:58.526 --> 01:17:00.485
right here on the orders.

01:17:00.485 --> 01:17:02.922
On the orders
from the man downstairs.

01:17:02.922 --> 01:17:06.143
The Camera family farmhouse
will be so bright and white,

01:17:06.143 --> 01:17:09.233
you can't miss it!

01:17:09.233 --> 01:17:11.670
Are you referring
to Carrie Anne Camera?

01:17:11.670 --> 01:17:14.630
What did you say to her
at the mental institution?

01:17:15.500 --> 01:17:17.502
Oh, but, Lee,

01:17:17.502 --> 01:17:20.766
your house was even whiter
when I came to visit.

01:17:22.463 --> 01:17:26.816
January 13th, 1974, right?

01:17:26.816 --> 01:17:29.557
House Number Eight
was so white.

01:17:29.557 --> 01:17:31.603
Whiter than a fish's throat.

01:17:31.603 --> 01:17:33.039
Whiter than tits.

01:17:33.039 --> 01:17:34.606
I knew then

01:17:34.606 --> 01:17:38.131
that the work we were doing
was immaculate.

01:17:41.613 --> 01:17:44.050
But your work's over.

01:17:44.050 --> 01:17:46.139
It's done,

01:17:46.139 --> 01:17:48.620
and you're gonna be in here
for the rest of your life.

01:17:53.146 --> 01:17:54.800
Yes.

01:17:57.063 --> 01:17:59.370
I am done...

01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:05.637
...but I won't only be in here.

01:18:05.637 --> 01:18:10.294
I'll be a little bit
of everywhere.

01:18:12.296 --> 01:18:14.951
Waiting...

01:18:14.951 --> 01:18:16.561
in the wings.

01:18:20.565 --> 01:18:23.176
In the father's wings.

01:18:25.613 --> 01:18:27.964
Who's been helping you?

01:18:30.357 --> 01:18:31.881
Well...

01:18:33.796 --> 01:18:37.190
I'll let you get started now.

01:18:37.190 --> 01:18:39.845
Who is the man downstairs?

01:18:44.371 --> 01:18:47.548
Why don't you ask your mommy?

01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:53.380
My mother
doesn't know anything.

01:18:59.647 --> 01:19:00.866
Hail Satan.

01:19:09.483 --> 01:19:10.789
Stop!

01:19:46.738 --> 01:19:48.348
That's it, Harker.

01:19:48.348 --> 01:19:49.262
That's more than enough.

01:19:49.262 --> 01:19:50.481
We had the guy,

01:19:50.481 --> 01:19:52.396
and now we got nothin'.

01:19:52.396 --> 01:19:54.441
We let all those families die,

01:19:54.441 --> 01:19:56.400
and nothin' about any of that
is better, or okay,

01:19:56.400 --> 01:19:57.793
but it's done!

01:19:58.532 --> 01:20:00.883
Oh, and as for the 13th--

01:20:00.883 --> 01:20:02.449
while you were in there,

01:20:02.449 --> 01:20:05.670
Carrie Anne Camera jumped
off the roof at Water Rock.

01:20:08.629 --> 01:20:09.935
Yeah.

01:20:09.935 --> 01:20:12.764
He must have told her to do that
when he saw her.

01:20:12.764 --> 01:20:14.505
Just like he somehow told
all the others

01:20:14.505 --> 01:20:15.723
to do what he wanted,

01:20:15.723 --> 01:20:18.596
but he did it alone,
with no accomplices!

01:20:18.596 --> 01:20:22.034
No black magic, no voodoo,
no nothing!

01:20:45.101 --> 01:20:47.843
You didn't
have to come with me.

01:20:47.843 --> 01:20:51.194
I wasn't gonna let you drive
after what you saw today.

01:20:56.155 --> 01:20:58.244
How do you wanna do this?

01:20:59.811 --> 01:21:02.031
I should go in alone.

01:21:02.031 --> 01:21:03.249
I'll tell her

01:21:03.249 --> 01:21:05.904
we need to bring her in
for questioning.

01:21:05.904 --> 01:21:09.299
That we think she could help us
identify the accomplice.

01:21:10.866 --> 01:21:12.824
All right.

01:21:12.824 --> 01:21:14.173
I'll stay right here.

01:21:58.217 --> 01:21:59.958
Mom?

01:22:35.951 --> 01:22:37.561
Mom?

01:23:32.616 --> 01:23:33.704
Mom!

01:23:33.704 --> 01:23:36.620
Put the gun down!

01:23:48.414 --> 01:23:50.286
What is that thing?

01:23:51.678 --> 01:23:54.029
You caught him.

01:23:56.422 --> 01:23:57.858
Now he's free.

01:23:58.816 --> 01:24:00.818
You mean Kobble?

01:24:00.818 --> 01:24:02.602
But...

01:24:02.602 --> 01:24:05.344
But Kobble's de-- he's gone.

01:24:05.344 --> 01:24:07.042
Kobble's dead.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.480
It's okay, Mom.

01:24:10.480 --> 01:24:12.351
It's...

01:24:12.351 --> 01:24:13.439
It's okay.

01:24:13.439 --> 01:24:14.484
It's...

01:24:14.484 --> 01:24:16.268
it's done now.

01:24:16.268 --> 01:24:19.706
And you're free, too,
baby girl.

01:25:02.575 --> 01:25:04.447
<i>Once upon a time,</i>

01:25:04.447 --> 01:25:06.579
<i>there was a girl named Lee.</i>

01:25:09.016 --> 01:25:12.150
<i>She lived in a little house
with her mother...</i>

01:25:15.893 --> 01:25:18.548
<i>and no one ever
came to visit them.</i>

01:25:20.289 --> 01:25:22.856
<i>No family.</i>

01:25:22.856 --> 01:25:26.338
<i>No big, bad wolves.</i>

01:25:26.338 --> 01:25:28.340
<i>No anyone.</i>

01:25:32.475 --> 01:25:36.305
<i>One day, a man did come...</i>

01:25:37.523 --> 01:25:39.525
Cuckoo!

01:25:39.525 --> 01:25:41.571
<i>...a doll maker.</i>

01:25:42.354 --> 01:25:46.619
Just dropping off
an early birthday gift,

01:25:46.619 --> 01:25:48.447
a gift from the church.

01:25:49.970 --> 01:25:52.059
You've won!

01:25:54.410 --> 01:25:57.717
<i>The doll maker
started his work...</i>

01:26:00.329 --> 01:26:03.462
<i>...his terrible magic.</i>

01:26:06.813 --> 01:26:08.902
<i>The work of the Devil...</i>

01:26:12.036 --> 01:26:16.780
<i>...with a little bit of him...</i>

01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:18.521
<i>in every one.</i>

01:26:21.088 --> 01:26:25.005
<i>The doll made
the little girl forget...</i>

01:26:25.005 --> 01:26:28.444
<i>and told her
where to look...</i>

01:26:28.444 --> 01:26:30.185
<i>and what not to see.</i>

01:26:32.883 --> 01:26:36.930
<i>The Devil wanted
the little girl for his own,</i>

01:26:36.930 --> 01:26:39.324
<i>but her mother could never
let that happen.</i>

01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:45.809
You could've
made nice with me,

01:26:45.809 --> 01:26:48.899
but you didn't...

01:26:48.899 --> 01:26:52.642
...and now that has led

01:26:52.642 --> 01:26:56.428
to all of this.

01:27:01.999 --> 01:27:04.131
<i>So her mother begged</i>

01:27:04.131 --> 01:27:06.786
<i>for the little girl's life
to be spared.</i>

01:27:08.266 --> 01:27:12.314
<i>In exchange,
she would have to help him.</i>

01:27:20.539 --> 01:27:22.715
<i>She had once been a nurse.</i>

01:27:25.283 --> 01:27:28.243
<i>Now her work would be...</i>

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:29.940
<i>murdering families...</i>

01:27:37.861 --> 01:27:39.732
<i>...and so it went like this...</i>

01:27:41.995 --> 01:27:44.259
<i>...knock-knock-knock,</i>

01:27:44.259 --> 01:27:45.782
<i>on the farmhouse door.</i>

01:27:47.087 --> 01:27:51.091
<i>A nice lady with a Bible...</i>

01:27:51.091 --> 01:27:53.572
<i>and a "Congratulations,</i>

01:27:53.572 --> 01:27:55.444
<i>you've won!</i>

01:27:55.444 --> 01:27:57.315
<i>A gift from the church."</i>

01:28:01.711 --> 01:28:05.236
<i>All her mother had to do...</i>

01:28:05.236 --> 01:28:06.846
<i>was get it inside...</i>

01:28:11.373 --> 01:28:16.465
<i>...and from his hiding place
within the dolls,</i>

01:28:16.465 --> 01:28:19.294
<i>the Devil did the rest.</i>

01:28:28.912 --> 01:28:31.393
<i>All her mother had to do...</i>

01:28:31.393 --> 01:28:32.872
<i>was watch...</i>

01:28:34.091 --> 01:28:39.009
<i>...and make sure it happened
the way he wanted it to.</i>

01:28:42.360 --> 01:28:45.407
<i>That was the deal
that she made.</i>

01:30:35.038 --> 01:30:37.475
<i>You're late...</i>

01:30:37.475 --> 01:30:40.870
<i>for Miss Ruby's birthday party.</i>

01:31:50.243 --> 01:31:52.332
Hey, Harker, you made it!

01:31:52.332 --> 01:31:53.856
Hi there, Harker.

01:31:53.856 --> 01:31:56.902
It's really nice that you came.

01:31:56.902 --> 01:31:58.556
Is everything okay?

01:31:58.556 --> 01:32:00.036
Of course, everything's great.

01:32:00.036 --> 01:32:01.777
In fact, you're here
just in time,

01:32:01.777 --> 01:32:03.605
because Miss Ruby just started
opening her presents.

01:32:05.171 --> 01:32:09.785
Come, sit. Sit.

01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:25.235
No, Carter, that's my mom.

01:32:25.235 --> 01:32:26.279
She's the accomplice.

01:32:26.279 --> 01:32:27.193
She's Kobble's accomplice--

01:32:27.193 --> 01:32:28.630
Sit down!

01:32:34.461 --> 01:32:36.986
Oh, I'm so sorry,
I've forgotten your name.

01:32:36.986 --> 01:32:39.902
I'm a terrible,
terrible, terrible hostess.

01:32:39.902 --> 01:32:43.601
Oh, don't mind me.

01:32:43.601 --> 01:32:45.516
I'm just a friend

01:32:45.516 --> 01:32:47.779
of a friend.

01:32:47.779 --> 01:32:48.998
No...

01:32:48.998 --> 01:32:50.695
Carter,
you have to listen to me.

01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:01.924
Honey, maybe now would be
a good time

01:33:01.924 --> 01:33:03.316
to bring out the cake.

01:33:06.058 --> 01:33:08.626
The cakes.

01:33:08.626 --> 01:33:10.236
Yeah,

01:33:10.236 --> 01:33:12.412
I'll find something
to cut up the cakes with.

01:33:14.719 --> 01:33:16.460
Uh...

01:33:16.460 --> 01:33:18.114
What did you say, honey?

01:33:19.115 --> 01:33:20.812
I just said,
do you have to...?

01:33:20.812 --> 01:33:23.989
Do I have to--
Do I have to cut up the cakes?

01:33:23.989 --> 01:33:25.164
Yeah, I gotta cut the cakes.

01:33:25.164 --> 01:33:26.165
It was your stupid
fucking suggestion

01:33:26.165 --> 01:33:27.123
in the first place,

01:33:27.123 --> 01:33:30.517
so I have to cut the cakes.

01:33:30.517 --> 01:33:34.826
The woman is already dead...

01:33:34.826 --> 01:33:39.265
and the little girl
will be next.

01:33:42.312 --> 01:33:44.619
Anna...

01:33:44.619 --> 01:33:48.579
would you like to join me
in the kitchen, honey?

01:33:48.579 --> 01:33:50.363
I'm so sorry,
I'll be right back.

01:33:50.363 --> 01:33:52.975
No, I'll be right back.

01:33:52.975 --> 01:33:54.672
you'll still be in the kitchen.

01:34:03.289 --> 01:34:05.291
All three of them have to die.

01:34:09.687 --> 01:34:11.863
Mom, why are you doing this?

01:34:17.477 --> 01:34:20.002
If they don't die,

01:34:20.002 --> 01:34:21.960
then we will burn...

01:34:22.918 --> 01:34:24.789
...and twist,

01:34:24.789 --> 01:34:27.009
and burn, and twist,

01:34:27.009 --> 01:34:28.967
in hell...

01:34:28.967 --> 01:34:30.752
forever...

01:34:30.752 --> 01:34:31.970
and ever.

01:34:36.061 --> 01:34:38.237
I'm doing this for you...

01:34:40.196 --> 01:34:42.720
...just like I've always done.

01:34:49.422 --> 01:34:52.164
So that the little girl
named Lee

01:34:52.164 --> 01:34:54.166
would be allowed to grow up...

01:34:59.476 --> 01:35:02.131
...and that makes it right...

01:35:06.004 --> 01:35:08.703
...and so I'll do it again...

01:35:08.703 --> 01:35:11.183
and again...

01:35:11.183 --> 01:35:12.532
...and again...

01:35:18.756 --> 01:35:20.105
...And I'll do it

01:35:20.105 --> 01:35:25.545
<i>until I stand
upon the sand of the sea,</i>

01:35:25.545 --> 01:35:30.942

01:35:48.003 --> 01:35:49.613

01:35:58.230 --> 01:36:01.233
Move away from the girl!

01:36:03.453 --> 01:36:04.802
Mom, please...

01:36:04.802 --> 01:36:07.152
Don't call me that!

01:36:28.695 --> 01:36:30.132

01:36:30.132 --> 01:36:31.698
