WEBVTT

01:48.376 --> 01:50.577
Here we are, Lily.

01:50.578 --> 01:51.979
You and me.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.782
Who would've thought that?

01:58.586 --> 02:00.687
Perhaps you already know

02:00.688 --> 02:02.756
that there comes a
time in our life

02:03.957 --> 02:07.428
when you do the math of
everything that has been,

02:09.430 --> 02:13.601
how it could have been
and what it's now.

02:22.142 --> 02:23.076
I didn't know it

02:24.612 --> 02:26.347
and I learned it the hard way

02:27.381 --> 02:31.018
that sometimes the right
choice carries too much weight.

02:32.753 --> 02:33.821
But that's life

02:35.589 --> 02:37.024
and I have to accept it.

02:40.728 --> 02:42.663
It all started much earlier.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.767
None of us could have known
what we were getting into.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.579
I would like to tell you

02:59.580 --> 03:02.149
that this is the story
of a group of heroes,

03:04.117 --> 03:05.185
but that's not true.

03:51.399 --> 03:52.266
Give it up.

03:55.669 --> 03:57.704
This is your last
warning, Nistrol.

03:57.705 --> 03:59.573
Surrender or die.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.878
Let our friend go, Hardin.

04:06.314 --> 04:08.181
This is between you and me.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.221
You want a deal, then
let's make a deal.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.031
You want a deal?

04:25.065 --> 04:25.933
All right.

04:28.001 --> 04:29.168
Here's my deal.

04:35.776 --> 04:38.745
Get after them! Don't
let them get away.

04:38.746 --> 04:39.647
Bastard!

04:56.630 --> 04:58.898
Back then, if
somebody talked about

04:58.899 --> 05:03.202
how Leland Nistrol made it
out of situation like that,

05:03.203 --> 05:06.038
while it's true that
he always made it,

05:06.039 --> 05:07.841
it was never without a scratch.

05:08.942 --> 05:11.444
Being an outlaw always
takes its toll.

05:11.445 --> 05:12.346
Go!

05:13.881 --> 05:15.114
Go!

05:15.115 --> 05:18.118
They called
us the "Nistrol Gang."

05:20.253 --> 05:22.423
And in around the
village of Brea,

05:23.624 --> 05:26.527
we were the most feared
bandits around.

05:28.596 --> 05:30.797
But we weren't the most
dangerous threat

05:30.798 --> 05:32.932
that gripped the king's mind.

05:32.933 --> 05:34.934
Creatures from the depths,

05:34.935 --> 05:36.869
which they called "orcs,"

05:36.870 --> 05:39.972
were far greater danger
to the people of Brea.

06:45.806 --> 06:50.443
And the king, a man alone
in defense of his kingdom,

06:50.444 --> 06:52.179
managed to keep danger away.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.380
But he couldn't know

06:54.381 --> 06:57.183
that it is often closer
than we imagined,

06:57.184 --> 07:01.654
and sometimes the true
face of those around us

07:01.655 --> 07:03.190
hides the darkness.

07:17.404 --> 07:18.806
You told us

07:20.708 --> 07:21.808
Nistrol had fled

07:21.809 --> 07:23.543
far from the land of Brea.

07:23.544 --> 07:24.877
Fear not, My Lord.

07:24.878 --> 07:27.747
My men and I will search
the forest high and low.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.916
If this vile band of
outlaws is still here,

07:29.917 --> 07:31.818
we will track them, find them,

07:31.819 --> 07:33.219
and I'll put a stop to them.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.153
You have my word.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.321
Thank you Captain.

07:35.322 --> 07:39.992
As you know, we have
repelled a mob of orcs,

07:39.993 --> 07:41.594
but they will return.

07:41.595 --> 07:45.932
They will return, soon.

07:45.933 --> 07:49.069
I need our men to defend
the lands of Brea.

07:50.370 --> 07:52.438
Nistrol and his gang,

07:52.439 --> 07:54.040
they are a problem

07:54.041 --> 07:57.845
and we must permanently
eliminate it.

07:58.779 --> 07:59.846
Yes milord.

07:59.847 --> 08:01.013
Cousin,

08:01.014 --> 08:02.915
these are dark days ahead.

08:02.916 --> 08:03.850
I'm actually very worried

08:03.851 --> 08:06.285
about what's happening
around here.

08:06.286 --> 08:08.555
We are at the mercy of outlaws

08:08.556 --> 08:12.024
and highway men who raid
and steal as they see fit.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.461
Goblins and ogres attacking
us from everywhere.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.196
A definitive solution
must be found.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.932
Lord Roland, you
think you know

08:19.933 --> 08:23.270
how to govern Brea
better than I?

08:28.909 --> 08:30.076
My Lord,

08:30.077 --> 08:32.712
if you gave the lands in
the east to my family,

08:32.713 --> 08:34.747
my guards could defend
those roads

08:34.748 --> 08:36.448
against more ogre attacks.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.718
That would guarantee us safety.

08:38.719 --> 08:42.221
The lands of Brea are
not transferable.

08:42.222 --> 08:45.626
We already have an army
in charge of those areas.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.294
As you like.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.497
Mine was just a proposal
for help, cousin.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.429
Father?

09:26.066 --> 09:29.001
Shall we go and see
the stars now?

09:29.002 --> 09:30.671
Not tonight, my love.

09:43.751 --> 09:47.621
Tomorrow night we shall
look at the stars, together.

09:49.522 --> 09:50.557
Oh, okay.

09:52.660 --> 09:53.526
Come.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.438
Good night.

10:06.840 --> 10:07.941
Sleep well.

10:27.695 --> 10:29.395
Everything is wrong.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.197
It would've been better
to run away.

10:31.198 --> 10:33.032
You're just a coward, Oliver.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.166
That's enough, Thomas.

10:34.167 --> 10:35.435
You're better than that.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.838
I don't want to
die like Tristan.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.073
Captain Hardin killed
him without mercy.

10:41.074 --> 10:42.574
You're afraid to die?

10:42.575 --> 10:43.876
Sounds like a coward to me.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.544
I'm not a coward.

10:45.545 --> 10:47.246
I'll kill you if you
say that again.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.615
Oh really? Right
here, show me.

10:49.616 --> 10:52.119
- Brothers.
-  Do it.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.187
Brothers.

10:56.489 --> 10:59.960
There's no point in
fighting amongst ourselves.

11:00.961 --> 11:03.863
Not now, not now that
we've come so far.

11:03.864 --> 11:05.598
We've had tough times before

11:06.466 --> 11:08.135
and we got through, together.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.238
And together we will win,
as we did today.

11:12.239 --> 11:15.042
We followed you when you
told us to save Tristan.

11:17.577 --> 11:20.948
Tristan is dead and we're
almost dead too.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.417
We won't give into
fear. Not now.

11:25.418 --> 11:28.722
We'll leave Brea and these
lands with what we have, then.

11:35.896 --> 11:37.364
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:38.498 --> 11:39.767
I just came to talk.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.305
Roland?

11:47.674 --> 11:49.575
What could you possibly
want to talk about enough

11:49.576 --> 11:52.912
to come out here in the
middle of the night,

11:52.913 --> 11:57.183
with just this ugly
mug to protect you?

11:58.318 --> 12:00.719
To speak
with you alone, Nistrol.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.221
Alone?

12:02.222 --> 12:03.589
Anything you have to say to me,

12:03.590 --> 12:06.659
you can say in front
of my men here.

12:07.928 --> 12:10.130
But choose your words carefully.

12:11.031 --> 12:14.333
After drinking, they
become a bit wild.

12:18.872 --> 12:20.673
I have a job for
you and your men.

12:22.242 --> 12:23.110
A job?

12:26.613 --> 12:28.949
If you know me and my family,

12:31.284 --> 12:32.919
even if only by name,

12:32.920 --> 12:35.856
then you should know that you
could make a lot of money.

12:36.957 --> 12:38.425
And once I pay you,

12:39.726 --> 12:40.726
I'll make sure that no one comes

12:40.727 --> 12:42.462
chasing after you
to get it back.

12:49.837 --> 12:52.339
And what sort of job are
we talking about, here?

12:54.241 --> 12:56.476
You must kill the bastard,
King Ferrel.

12:58.345 --> 13:00.046
King Ferrel?

13:00.047 --> 13:03.851
He's had his men chasing
our asses all this time.

13:04.684 --> 13:06.719
Why would we risk so much?

13:09.622 --> 13:13.460
Have you ever seen
50,000 coins altogether?

13:15.428 --> 13:16.463
It can all be yours.

13:18.531 --> 13:21.233
Entering the castle
will not be complicated.

13:21.234 --> 13:24.337
Guards are busy protecting the
border from orcs right now.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.506
And once I'm king,

13:27.507 --> 13:29.308
I can guarantee that
the law of Brea

13:29.309 --> 13:31.912
will never be breathing
down your necks again.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.326
We should do this.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.596
This is our chance.

13:53.033 --> 13:53.934
It's a trap.

13:56.669 --> 13:57.670
Oliver's right.

13:58.638 --> 13:59.706
Sounds like a trap.

14:01.808 --> 14:04.510
He just wants to get
us all back there

14:04.511 --> 14:07.146
so they can finally grab
us all at once.

14:07.147 --> 14:10.217
No, not this time.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.120
You heard him.

14:14.021 --> 14:16.522
He's offering us 50,000 coins

14:16.523 --> 14:20.292
and the guarantee that
we get out of Brea

14:20.293 --> 14:21.628
with no one following us.

14:22.529 --> 14:23.395
I mean, come on.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.898
It's 50,000 coins.

14:25.899 --> 14:28.568
This is what we've
been waiting for;

14:29.502 --> 14:31.571
our chance to be free men again.

14:33.073 --> 14:35.407
To be free so we no longer need

14:35.408 --> 14:37.144
to look over our shoulders.

14:38.345 --> 14:41.881
How many of us even
remember that time?

14:45.185 --> 14:46.553
And the best part is,

14:47.454 --> 14:51.124
we get to send Ferrel
to hell in the process.

14:54.928 --> 14:55.795
Yes?

15:09.309 --> 15:13.180
The Nistrol gang are at
your service, Lord Roland.

15:18.251 --> 15:22.754
But please, do explain
how you expect

15:22.755 --> 15:25.292
to get us inside this castle?

15:27.594 --> 15:29.095
It's easy.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.762
There's a second entrance
down by the river,

15:30.763 --> 15:32.165
but there's only one guard.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.971
And when he sees me,

15:38.972 --> 15:40.906
he'll walk towards
me and he'll say,

15:40.907 --> 15:42.474
Lord Roland.

15:42.475 --> 15:43.743
Good evening.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.613
I'm gonna need your best man

15:47.680 --> 15:50.350
to jump down from the wall
behind him and take him out.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.419
And then your team is gonna
run through that hallway,

15:53.420 --> 15:55.988
right through the center
of the castle.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.923
But everyone must wear a mask,

15:57.924 --> 16:01.160
to hide their identity,
including me.

16:27.787 --> 16:32.825
Roland, you are
a vile traitor.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.229
I expected it from you.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.600
Little worm.

16:42.569 --> 16:47.607
Then you go and bring
Leland Nistrol and his men

16:48.075 --> 16:51.310
here, in the middle
of the night.

16:51.311 --> 16:54.714
That's right, I know
who you are.

16:56.483 --> 17:01.254
The Baelian brothers,
Diana, John,

17:02.055 --> 17:04.524
and Jack the Silent.

17:06.326 --> 17:10.162
And I shall have all of you

17:10.163 --> 17:14.901
hung in the village
square at sunrise.

17:17.337 --> 17:19.272
Now, drop your weapons.

17:24.544 --> 17:26.745
Good evening to
you too, My Lord.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.814
What are you doing?

17:28.815 --> 17:31.049
He knows who we are.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.518
And he has the right to see

17:32.519 --> 17:34.787
the face of the man
who's going to kill him.

17:35.688 --> 17:37.889
I welcome you to try.

17:37.890 --> 17:41.060
All these swords are
pointing at you, Ferrel.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.699
Soldiers.

18:04.284 --> 18:08.019
Now, Nistrol. You have
the same look on your face

18:08.020 --> 18:12.325
that your friend Tristan
Godfrey had when we found him.

18:14.093 --> 18:18.864
And you are all going
to share the same end.

18:29.976 --> 18:31.844
We all may die here tonight,

18:36.149 --> 18:37.784
but you'll be dying with us.

18:46.259 --> 18:47.126
Now!

19:27.367 --> 19:31.503
Captain Hardin is going
to kill you, Nistrol.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.104
You can count on it.

19:33.105 --> 19:34.606
And you should count
the minutes

19:34.607 --> 19:36.042
you have left to breathe.

19:43.149 --> 19:44.617
No, no, no, no, no, no.

19:49.756 --> 19:53.726
Lily honey, go back
to your room.

19:55.395 --> 19:56.795
Come on.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.097
What are you waiting for?

20:08.275 --> 20:09.742
We become what we choose.

20:12.078 --> 20:12.979
All of you

20:14.381 --> 20:16.383
still have time to choose.

20:54.354 --> 20:55.887
What the hell did you do?

20:55.888 --> 20:58.291
What you should have done!

21:04.196 --> 21:06.465
Now we have to kill
the girl, too.

21:06.466 --> 21:08.368
She saw my face.

21:09.669 --> 21:10.970
The girl has to die.

21:11.938 --> 21:14.072
Look, you wanted him dead,

21:14.073 --> 21:16.342
now he's dead thanks to you.

21:16.343 --> 21:17.275
You shouldn't have killed him.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.276
Not like that.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.311
Not here.

21:19.312 --> 21:21.613
Just think about it, Nistrol.

21:21.614 --> 21:23.849
More guards are assuredly
already on their way.

21:23.850 --> 21:25.951
We have to kill the girl.

21:25.952 --> 21:27.219
We don't have much time.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.659
You're a damn fool,
you know that Roland?

21:33.660 --> 21:35.260
Am I?

21:35.261 --> 21:37.696
Well listen to me, because
I have a plan.

21:37.697 --> 21:39.297
You take the blame

21:39.298 --> 21:40.766
for the king's murder
and his daughter's.

21:40.767 --> 21:43.669
Look, they're gonna blame
you for this already, anyway.

21:43.670 --> 21:45.705
Once the girl is dead,
I become king

21:46.539 --> 21:48.441
and I can promise
you safe passage.

21:49.376 --> 21:52.745
I'm the one
who's paying you.

21:53.980 --> 21:54.914
Yeah, that's right.

21:55.882 --> 21:57.015
If I take the fall for this

21:57.016 --> 21:58.885
or if you hurt me or
try to kill me,

22:00.587 --> 22:02.053
you get nothing.

22:02.054 --> 22:03.690
You're a bloody snake.

22:06.025 --> 22:10.597
I will pay you 100,000
coins, Nistrol.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.901
You'll get a tomorrow
at Beach Tree Pass.

22:16.736 --> 22:19.371
Come on Leland, this is crazy.

22:19.372 --> 22:21.207
We don't kill children.

22:22.709 --> 22:25.378
100,000 coins, just
to kill the girl.

22:27.013 --> 22:28.213
I'll tell Captain Hardin

22:28.214 --> 22:32.083
that you took me and
the king hostage

22:32.084 --> 22:33.585
and you were just about
to kill me too,

22:33.586 --> 22:35.987
but he showed up just in time.

22:35.988 --> 22:39.758
Then we should kill you, now.

22:39.759 --> 22:41.661
That's exactly what
we should do.

22:42.462 --> 22:43.329
Leland.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.103
Trust me, Nistrol.

22:53.105 --> 22:53.973
Trust me.

23:06.819 --> 23:07.820
We do this.

23:09.422 --> 23:10.523
We do this.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.626
No, Leland. We can't.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.262
Yes, we can.

23:17.063 --> 23:19.432
Now go and do it.

23:25.004 --> 23:26.773
You have lost it, Nistrol.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.583
I am not the only
one who sees it.

23:37.584 --> 23:38.717
We don't kill children.

23:38.718 --> 23:39.585
We don't do that.

23:39.586 --> 23:41.053
We can't do that.

23:48.294 --> 23:50.061
Don't ever point a blade

23:50.062 --> 23:51.531
unless you intend to use it.

24:03.342 --> 24:05.044
This had to be done.

24:15.187 --> 24:16.422
Don't you see?

24:18.658 --> 24:21.561
They're going to blame
Ferrel's death on us anyway.

24:23.129 --> 24:26.197
This snake's words,
they're not worth much.

24:26.198 --> 24:27.333
But he's right.

24:29.869 --> 24:31.537
We should do the smart thing.

24:31.538 --> 24:34.406
Take the money and
leave everything behind.

24:35.642 --> 24:38.376
She's just a little
girl, Leland.

24:38.377 --> 24:41.848
Yes, and now she's all alone.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.784
Hardin's men are coming.

24:45.818 --> 24:47.086
The hell happened here?

24:48.588 --> 24:50.222
He didn't do as he was told.

24:59.866 --> 25:01.934
He didn't do as he was told.

25:04.771 --> 25:06.305
We will all do as you ask,

25:08.107 --> 25:13.144
and you will do as you promised.

25:13.145 --> 25:16.716
Of course, as long
as that girl is killed.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.052
I'll do it.

25:24.290 --> 25:25.324
Jack, get her out.

25:57.556 --> 25:59.158
Let's go!

26:03.162 --> 26:03.996
Traitors!

26:06.332 --> 26:09.200
Grab one of your men
and get the girl!

26:09.201 --> 26:10.102
Go on!

26:19.078 --> 26:21.347
Hold the gates!

26:23.650 --> 26:25.116
Cease fire!

26:25.117 --> 26:27.152
I'll find another way.

26:27.153 --> 26:28.419
Go.

26:36.562 --> 26:37.395
Find them!

26:37.396 --> 26:39.198
They must not escape!

28:44.824 --> 28:46.591
He managed to escape,

28:46.592 --> 28:47.625
with the little girl.

28:47.626 --> 28:49.094
What?

28:49.095 --> 28:51.129
I didn't saw them outside.

28:51.130 --> 28:52.297
We know.

28:52.298 --> 28:53.532
She got away?

28:55.634 --> 28:57.469
You will do as I
tell you, right?

28:59.171 --> 29:00.739
Right, right.

29:05.411 --> 29:07.312
Come out, Nistrol.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.781
We have the place completely
surrounded.

29:09.782 --> 29:11.517
Put your weapons
down, it's over!

29:32.004 --> 29:32.839
Lord Roland?

29:36.442 --> 29:38.677
They kidnapped me.

29:39.879 --> 29:43.049
Some of Nistrol's men wanted
to send a message to Brea,

29:43.315 --> 29:44.916
but he didn't.

29:44.917 --> 29:47.887
And they tied me up and
they brought me here.

29:50.789 --> 29:51.858
Where is the king?

29:53.192 --> 29:54.060
King?

29:58.664 --> 29:59.531
He's dead.

30:00.900 --> 30:02.700
And they wanted to kill me too,

30:02.701 --> 30:06.604
but Nistrol stopped him.

30:06.605 --> 30:09.374
Why would Leland
Nistrol fight his own men

30:09.375 --> 30:10.509
to save you, My Lord?

30:18.885 --> 30:21.720
Because those bastards
betrayed me.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.957
The men went rogue.

30:25.958 --> 30:27.792
They started acting
for themselves.

30:27.793 --> 30:30.096
They stopped believing
in me as their leader.

30:33.499 --> 30:34.732
Let me help you.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.635
Help me?

30:37.636 --> 30:39.704
What help could a low
life outlaw like you

30:39.705 --> 30:42.173
Provide me, scum?

30:42.174 --> 30:44.776
I know those men better
than their own mothers.

30:49.015 --> 30:53.985
Lord Ferrel's daughter,
they will kill her, Hardin.

30:53.986 --> 30:54.887
They will.

30:57.289 --> 31:01.326
They have no code, loyalty,
no remorse!

31:01.327 --> 31:02.261
Go to hell!

31:05.831 --> 31:08.334
You'll never catch
them, not alone.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.169
They're some of my best men.

31:11.170 --> 31:13.839
They're skilled, trained,

31:15.441 --> 31:17.009
and I know where they're going.

31:23.115 --> 31:24.750
The king is dead.

31:25.784 --> 31:28.420
Now I take the throne,

31:30.122 --> 31:32.190
until we bring his
legitimate heir back here,

31:32.191 --> 31:33.192
safe and sound.

31:34.927 --> 31:38.197
I order you to find the child.

31:39.231 --> 31:40.098
We owe it to King Ferrel

31:40.099 --> 31:41.968
and we owe it to the
people of Brea.

31:50.977 --> 31:51.978
Yes, My Lord.

31:56.648 --> 31:57.448
All right, Nistrol.

31:57.449 --> 31:58.450
Come out, you're safe.

32:49.801 --> 32:51.503
Why did you bring me here?

32:53.239 --> 32:54.906
You don't talk much do you?

32:56.042 --> 32:58.876
I do. Maybe you do not
know how to speak.

32:58.877 --> 33:00.446
I can teach you, if you want.

33:02.514 --> 33:05.883
You remind me of this
dog my dad used to have.

33:05.884 --> 33:07.985
He was big and never barked.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.188
But spending enough
time with me,

33:10.189 --> 33:12.291
he started barking again.

33:19.898 --> 33:21.866
My mom loves to sing.

33:21.867 --> 33:24.135
She used to tell me
bedtime stories

33:24.136 --> 33:26.204
about the woods at night.

33:26.205 --> 33:27.538
You know the story about,

33:27.539 --> 33:31.542
once upon a time, there
was a bear named Guston.

33:31.543 --> 33:34.545
Guston ate honey from
smaller trees.

33:34.546 --> 33:36.048
You look like Guston.

33:37.449 --> 33:40.017
Oh, what was I saying?
Nevermind.

33:40.018 --> 33:42.053
Guston used to eat honey.

33:42.054 --> 33:43.921
But one day, Guston saw a fox.

33:43.922 --> 33:46.857
The fox took all of
Guston's honey.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.026
My dad knows how to do it.

33:49.027 --> 33:50.828
Come have dinner
with us sometime

33:50.829 --> 33:52.863
and he will teach you how.

33:52.864 --> 33:56.701
He would take some little
branches, take some rope,

33:56.702 --> 33:58.436
tie the rope in each side,

33:58.437 --> 34:01.072
and then, if you pull the rope,

34:01.073 --> 34:06.145
the branch will bend and then
that's how the bow works.

34:06.478 --> 34:09.180
But, you can only
use it outside,

34:09.181 --> 34:11.750
because you can hurt somebody.

34:25.564 --> 34:26.998
She's sleeping.

34:34.406 --> 34:35.274
And now?

34:38.110 --> 34:40.812
Now we continue our way.

34:41.680 --> 34:43.048
We did what we could.

34:45.016 --> 34:46.051
She's alive.

34:47.186 --> 34:49.355
You're not thinking
of leaving her here?

34:53.692 --> 34:54.560
Are you?

34:59.698 --> 35:00.832
She's only little.

35:02.501 --> 35:04.202
It's not our problem.

35:04.203 --> 35:06.438
Let's stock up on water
and get out of here.

35:07.306 --> 35:08.940
They'll already be on our trail.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.044
We'll got the horses ready.

35:58.790 --> 36:00.992
What are you looking at?

36:19.044 --> 36:20.479
Do you want some?

36:57.949 --> 36:58.817
Stop!

37:03.955 --> 37:04.823
Come on!

37:47.966 --> 37:51.503
Go! Go!

37:56.041 --> 38:00.178
The Baelian brothers,
Diana, John, Silent Jack,

38:02.080 --> 38:05.049
wanted for the murder
of King Ferrel

38:05.050 --> 38:07.485
and the kidnapping of his
beloved daughter, Lily.

38:07.486 --> 38:11.056
These,

38:17.262 --> 38:18.129
Something funny?

38:21.199 --> 38:23.033
No, go on.

38:23.034 --> 38:27.806
These enemies of Brea
are wanted dead or alive.

38:31.176 --> 38:33.010
So, spread the news.

38:33.011 --> 38:36.981
The reward is 20,000
gold pieces each.

38:36.982 --> 38:40.651
Lord Goran, one of the best
knights that Brea has to offer.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.888
Tell me that you'll
help us find this scum.

38:44.556 --> 38:47.224
You can count on me

38:47.225 --> 38:50.528
and my son, Tyrion,

38:50.529 --> 38:52.096
Lord Hardin.

38:52.097 --> 38:52.998
Good.

38:54.265 --> 38:55.133
Your son?

38:55.967 --> 38:56.834
Why do you still call him that?

38:56.835 --> 38:58.437
Everyone knows he's a bastard.

39:03.542 --> 39:06.912
Yes, he is a bastard.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.750
But he has earned his
name with the sword.

39:13.385 --> 39:17.021
I have always fought
in service of Brea

39:17.022 --> 39:19.425
and now he does the same.

39:21.059 --> 39:24.361
His mother wanted to keep him

39:24.362 --> 39:27.533
and now he has the opportunity

39:28.834 --> 39:30.636
to prove to me his worth.

39:37.008 --> 39:38.744
What do
you suggest we do?

39:40.412 --> 39:44.081
They'll be heading for a
cave near Beach Tree Pass.

39:44.082 --> 39:45.283
How do you know that?

39:48.854 --> 39:49.821
Because I know.

39:52.858 --> 39:55.192
We have a stash of money
in a cave there,

39:55.193 --> 39:57.095
for a situation just like this.

39:57.929 --> 39:59.931
That's where they'll be going.

40:03.635 --> 40:05.236
You better hope you're right.

40:20.552 --> 40:21.853
A nice reward.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.997
Don't think too much.

40:32.898 --> 40:34.633
Keep your mind on the goal.

40:36.134 --> 40:40.271
Take those outlaws dead
or alive, you decide.

40:41.740 --> 40:42.608
I don't care.

41:23.014 --> 41:24.916
You best still get
me what you owe.

41:26.351 --> 41:28.353
Not as long as that
girl still lives.

41:29.655 --> 41:30.556
She'll be dead,

41:31.456 --> 41:32.323
soon enough.

41:55.313 --> 41:57.648
All right men, no mercy.

41:57.649 --> 41:58.550
Move out!

42:34.720 --> 42:38.255
I won't see my father
again, will I?

42:38.256 --> 42:39.089
No.

42:39.090 --> 42:40.125
He's dead.

42:41.426 --> 42:43.027
Yeah.

42:43.028 --> 42:44.161
Yeah, he's dead.

42:44.162 --> 42:47.598
What is it like to be dead?

42:47.599 --> 42:49.433
None of us really knows.

42:49.434 --> 42:51.201
None of us died, yet.

42:51.202 --> 42:52.771
Not yet.

42:54.439 --> 42:57.274
Well, did you want
my father dead?

42:57.275 --> 42:59.811
No, none of us did.

43:01.246 --> 43:03.080
It was never part of the plan.

43:03.081 --> 43:04.615
Not for us, anyway.

43:04.616 --> 43:07.184
So, why was he killed then?

43:07.185 --> 43:08.654
They were bad men with us.

43:09.621 --> 43:12.858
Why were they with you
if they were bad?

43:16.394 --> 43:18.696
Let's just say, we
all used to be friends.

43:18.697 --> 43:20.832
We're not. We're not anymore.

43:22.167 --> 43:24.902
I still don't really
understand.

43:24.903 --> 43:29.807
If my father was good and
some bad man killed him,

43:29.808 --> 43:32.678
then are you good
or are you bad?

43:36.181 --> 43:37.215
As you all know,

43:38.183 --> 43:40.918
our beloved King Ferrel
lost his life

43:40.919 --> 43:43.188
to the hands of vile criminals.

43:44.189 --> 43:46.557
And believe me, my
heart is broken.

43:47.859 --> 43:50.896
I could easily be there under
the ground with him today.

43:52.764 --> 43:54.132
But I am here.

43:55.133 --> 43:57.802
And I promise you and our king,

43:57.803 --> 44:00.238
who's watching over
us all right now,

44:02.007 --> 44:03.541
that we will find his daughter

44:05.476 --> 44:08.513
and we will bring back
her kidnappers to Brea,

44:09.815 --> 44:12.750
where they will serve
their justice.

44:30.201 --> 44:32.102
I need to pee.

44:32.103 --> 44:34.104
Again?

44:34.105 --> 44:35.039
You just did.

44:35.040 --> 44:38.308
I need to do it again.
I can't hold it.

44:38.309 --> 44:39.244
Not now.

44:40.478 --> 44:41.979
I'm gonna
pee on the horse.

44:41.980 --> 44:43.048
All right!

44:44.015 --> 44:45.717
John, take her.

44:46.517 --> 44:47.385
Why me?

44:49.554 --> 44:50.555
Just do it.

44:51.923 --> 44:52.858
And hurry up.

45:57.088 --> 45:59.724
Calm down, my fellow
highway men.

46:02.794 --> 46:03.761
The Griso.

46:06.031 --> 46:09.666
Do you know how long
we've been out here,

46:09.667 --> 46:11.402
waiting for travelers?

46:13.071 --> 46:15.406
Part of the job, I suppose.

46:18.276 --> 46:21.278
Tell me, what are the
Baelian brothers

46:21.279 --> 46:24.448
doing at Beach Tree Pass,

46:24.449 --> 46:25.450
with a little girl?

46:27.618 --> 46:30.787
None of your concern, old man.

46:30.788 --> 46:31.689
Wow.

46:32.891 --> 46:33.859
Easy now.

46:34.792 --> 46:36.627
No need to get defensive,

46:38.596 --> 46:39.931
or is there?

46:42.834 --> 46:46.271
Unless she's valuable
in some way?

46:50.241 --> 46:51.142
She isn't.

46:52.010 --> 46:56.947
Well, then you won't mind
us taking her with us, anyway.

46:56.948 --> 46:59.217
Trust me. You don't want her.

47:00.151 --> 47:01.386
She talks too much

47:02.320 --> 47:03.387
and pees a lot.

47:03.388 --> 47:04.289
I don't pee a lot!

47:06.291 --> 47:08.159
Then, there you have it.

47:10.028 --> 47:11.062
Sorry Diana.

47:11.963 --> 47:14.932
We've been out here
for far too long,

47:14.933 --> 47:17.835
that we can't just let you
go without taking anything.

47:18.870 --> 47:20.405
I'm sure you understand me.

47:21.639 --> 47:24.509
The child must come with us.

47:27.879 --> 47:30.280
I'm afraid we can't
let that happen.

47:30.281 --> 47:33.251
I'm afraid you have no choice.

47:35.220 --> 47:36.954
You are funny though, I mean,

47:36.955 --> 47:39.789
I could just have you
all killed right now

47:39.790 --> 47:41.326
and take her with us anyway.

47:46.231 --> 47:47.098
Or?

47:54.239 --> 47:55.273
Your choice.

48:08.019 --> 48:08.886
Take her.

48:10.155 --> 48:11.022
She's yours.

48:13.891 --> 48:16.427
Much obliged, Diana.

48:23.234 --> 48:24.936
No, no, I don't want to go!

48:29.740 --> 48:31.976
No, no, I
don't want to go!

48:59.104 --> 49:00.670
What the hell are
you doing, Diana?

49:00.671 --> 49:02.506
Didn't have a choice, John.

49:02.507 --> 49:04.508
Would you rather
us be dead? Hmm?

49:04.509 --> 49:05.909
They had the drop on us.

49:05.910 --> 49:07.411
The would've killed us
all, right then and there.

49:07.412 --> 49:08.845
Is that what you want?

49:08.846 --> 49:10.014
All our mother's children

49:10.015 --> 49:11.915
gone from this earth,
all at once,

49:11.916 --> 49:14.018
to finally be with
her and father?

49:14.019 --> 49:15.752
Captain Hardin probably
already has

49:15.753 --> 49:18.022
our faces posted all
over the place.

49:18.023 --> 49:20.890
I bet, by now, we're the
three most wanted villains.

49:20.891 --> 49:22.526
We don't have much time.

49:22.527 --> 49:25.595
We need to be quick if
we want to stay alive

49:25.596 --> 49:27.797
and get the money that Leland
had hidden in the forest,

49:27.798 --> 49:29.299
before he does.

49:29.300 --> 49:32.402
Only then we can go as far
and as fast away from here,

49:32.403 --> 49:34.439
from all of this, as possible.

49:35.306 --> 49:37.274
We were too slow
with her anyway.

49:37.275 --> 49:38.809
She was just slowing us down.

49:49.587 --> 49:50.455
Jack, wait!

49:55.493 --> 49:57.094
He's right, Diana.

49:57.095 --> 49:58.563
We can't do this.

50:07.972 --> 50:10.640
She is not our responsibility,
John!

50:10.641 --> 50:13.009
Did you not just hear me?

50:13.010 --> 50:14.545
We have our own problems.

50:32.130 --> 50:34.431
Where are we going?

50:34.432 --> 50:35.999
It stinks.

50:36.000 --> 50:37.535
I want to get off.

50:40.871 --> 50:42.840
I don't like this horse.

50:46.244 --> 50:47.112
I'm tired.

50:48.413 --> 50:51.047
All right, I'm hungry anyway.

50:51.048 --> 50:51.949
Up!

51:15.373 --> 51:16.374
You want some?

51:17.275 --> 51:19.310
I'm not hungry.

51:34.559 --> 51:37.227
Now, take this and
play with this.

51:37.228 --> 51:39.330
Let us enjoy our food.

51:40.598 --> 51:42.600
We've got a long ride ahead.

51:44.202 --> 51:46.035
But I don't wanna play.

51:46.036 --> 51:48.338
I didn't ask you what
you wanted to do.

51:48.339 --> 51:51.208
I just told you what to do.

51:51.209 --> 51:53.510
Now, do it!

51:53.511 --> 51:54.444
No!

52:10.361 --> 52:13.231
I don't want to hear
another word out of you.

52:16.234 --> 52:19.570
I am the one who make
decisions here.

52:21.306 --> 52:22.773
Do you understand?

53:12.523 --> 53:14.459
Guston, he came back!

53:27.071 --> 53:28.506
Kill him! Kill!

53:29.940 --> 53:33.510
Go, go, go!

56:43.834 --> 56:44.702
Diana?

56:51.275 --> 56:52.176
There's nothing.

56:53.744 --> 56:54.612
What?

56:56.280 --> 56:58.348
There's nothing here.
There's no money.

57:00.951 --> 57:03.454
Leland's been lying to
us from the beginning.

57:04.254 --> 57:06.356
He never kept any of
our earnings here.

57:09.093 --> 57:12.129
It's like, everything
was just a lie.

57:17.134 --> 57:18.002
So what now?

57:19.169 --> 57:20.037
I don't know.

57:23.340 --> 57:25.141
It's hard to get too
far for too long,

57:25.142 --> 57:26.276
without any money.

57:35.853 --> 57:37.822
Hey, look at the sun!

58:40.651 --> 58:41.951
You there!

58:41.952 --> 58:43.553
Untie me, please.

58:43.554 --> 58:45.455
I can give you a reward.

58:52.429 --> 58:54.731
The bounty on your
head is far more

58:54.732 --> 58:58.135
than any reward you could
give me, Griso.

59:00.738 --> 59:02.607
But today is your lucky day.

59:04.374 --> 59:06.243
I am on someone else's trail.

59:07.377 --> 59:09.646
I'm sure you are following
those three

59:09.647 --> 59:10.748
with the little girl?

59:11.682 --> 59:16.552
I can tell you which way
they went and what they did.

59:16.553 --> 59:20.189
They tied you by the
balls and they went north.

59:20.190 --> 59:22.426
I don't need to know more.

01:00:12.743 --> 01:00:14.144
My men did this to you.

01:00:16.446 --> 01:00:18.148
I never understood

01:00:19.183 --> 01:00:21.151
how you got them to follow you

01:00:22.486 --> 01:00:24.288
as long as you did,
Leland Nistrol.

01:00:27.825 --> 01:00:29.058
Baelian brothers,

01:00:29.059 --> 01:00:31.662
they're not exactly
the orders type.

01:00:32.629 --> 01:00:35.332
Now you know it, don't you?

01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.501
Was there a
little girl with them?

01:00:38.502 --> 01:00:43.006
They gave her to
me and then came

01:00:43.007 --> 01:00:45.809
and stole her back.

01:00:45.810 --> 01:00:49.046
That's what this was all about.

01:00:50.114 --> 01:00:51.048
They killed

01:00:53.718 --> 01:00:54.584
all

01:00:56.320 --> 01:00:57.187
my men.

01:01:08.465 --> 01:01:09.499
Leave him.

01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:21.045
Out of all those
men that night,

01:01:26.817 --> 01:01:29.353
the only man who was trying
to do the right thing,

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.858
died.

01:01:38.028 --> 01:01:39.296
And it's all our fault.

01:01:44.835 --> 01:01:46.970
You know we can't keep
her with us, though.

01:01:46.971 --> 01:01:47.872
You know that.

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.440
We could take her
south to Nora.

01:01:52.509 --> 01:01:54.077
They're friends of Brea.

01:01:54.078 --> 01:01:55.011
She's the (indistinct) daughter.

01:01:55.012 --> 01:01:56.580
They would protect her, there.

01:01:58.548 --> 01:01:59.917
It's the right thing to do.

01:02:01.618 --> 01:02:03.552
We could find a wagon, then.

01:02:03.553 --> 01:02:05.923
Hide in the North with
whatever we could grab.

01:02:09.259 --> 01:02:10.828
I am going to get us more wood.

01:02:55.672 --> 01:02:57.374
Who do we have here?

01:03:00.344 --> 01:03:01.410
What a good guy, you are.

01:03:01.411 --> 01:03:02.778
You came here alone?

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:04.247
Then, you can speak?

01:03:11.055 --> 01:03:14.757
Or maybe you don't know
how to say "thank you."

01:03:14.758 --> 01:03:18.027
Oh, you guessed it.
I can't speak.

01:03:18.028 --> 01:03:19.596
But I can do this.

01:03:35.913 --> 01:03:37.414
Are you all right?

01:03:53.931 --> 01:03:54.798
Hey.

01:03:57.634 --> 01:03:58.834
Hey.

01:04:55.759 --> 01:04:58.061
That doesn't change
things between us.

01:04:58.062 --> 01:05:00.397
Pity, I started to like you.

01:05:03.167 --> 01:05:04.834
Why are you following me?

01:05:06.303 --> 01:05:07.171
You don't know?

01:05:08.172 --> 01:05:10.006
You killed our King Ferrel

01:05:10.007 --> 01:05:12.576
and kidnapped the most
wanted girl in the kingdom.

01:05:14.011 --> 01:05:16.645
Seems like a valid
reason, don't you think?

01:05:16.646 --> 01:05:17.547
No.

01:05:18.382 --> 01:05:19.315
I thought you were hunting me

01:05:19.316 --> 01:05:21.018
for everything I've done before.

01:05:23.453 --> 01:05:24.321
Wait.

01:05:25.822 --> 01:05:27.857
There is something wrong
with the story.

01:05:28.892 --> 01:05:30.427
No one believes Lord Roland,

01:05:31.328 --> 01:05:32.496
but he's a lord.

01:05:34.231 --> 01:05:35.099
And now,

01:05:36.300 --> 01:05:37.800
I want to know what's
happened to the king

01:05:37.801 --> 01:05:40.370
from you, Diana Baelian.

01:05:44.674 --> 01:05:46.176
Tyrion Van Desta,

01:05:47.744 --> 01:05:49.179
I know exactly who you are.

01:05:51.515 --> 01:05:53.750
I know that you're Goran's
bastard son.

01:05:54.851 --> 01:05:57.687
And even if your father
is an asshole,

01:05:59.089 --> 01:06:01.191
I also know you are a good man.

01:06:04.361 --> 01:06:05.695
We didn't kill the king,

01:06:07.064 --> 01:06:08.964
and we're trying to protect
his daughter

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:10.633
from those who want her dead.

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:12.102
And don't ask me why,

01:06:13.370 --> 01:06:14.638
because I don't know why.

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:18.608
And how do I know
you're not lying?

01:06:24.414 --> 01:06:26.316
Because someone once said,

01:06:29.019 --> 01:06:30.754
"We become who we choose."

01:06:34.691 --> 01:06:39.729
And I know that you look
beyond the things you see.

01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.668
This is taking too
long, Nistrol.

01:07:21.771 --> 01:07:23.272
If you are stalling us,

01:07:23.273 --> 01:07:25.574
I will personally drag
you back to Brea

01:07:25.575 --> 01:07:27.276
and hang you in the town
square, myself.

01:07:27.277 --> 01:07:29.612
And if you are fooling
us, I will do far worse.

01:07:29.613 --> 01:07:31.648
So were they here or not?

01:07:32.649 --> 01:07:35.485
Yes, they were
here, as I said.

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:38.722
They're probably a day
or two away from us.

01:07:41.191 --> 01:07:43.259
You better hope you're right,

01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:46.363
because my men are
tired and I'm impatient.

01:07:47.831 --> 01:07:51.201
Captain, we are
on the same team.

01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:54.037
You need to stop threatening me.

01:07:56.140 --> 01:07:59.508
You and I are not the
same, Leland Nistrol.

01:07:59.509 --> 01:08:01.345
You and I are nothing alike.

01:08:02.979 --> 01:08:04.613
Don't forget what
you really are,

01:08:04.614 --> 01:08:06.782
because when this is all over,

01:08:06.783 --> 01:08:07.684
neither will I.

01:08:11.455 --> 01:08:12.755
Set up camp!

01:08:53.997 --> 01:08:54.864
Tyrion.

01:08:57.267 --> 01:08:58.134
What news?

01:08:59.569 --> 01:09:01.305
None, you?

01:09:06.176 --> 01:09:07.544
Harry, report.

01:09:15.118 --> 01:09:16.485
Captain Hardin,

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:18.254
we spotted them nearby.

01:09:18.255 --> 01:09:20.556
They're camped by the creek bed.

01:09:20.557 --> 01:09:22.258
That's less than
an hour from here.

01:09:22.259 --> 01:09:23.727
Just as I said.

01:09:24.561 --> 01:09:26.129
We will divide our forces.

01:09:27.231 --> 01:09:28.331
I'll attack from the front.

01:09:28.332 --> 01:09:30.599
Nistrol, you go upstream
and cut off their escape.

01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:32.501
That way they're completely
surrounded.

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:34.237
Break this camp down
and move out.

01:09:34.238 --> 01:09:35.472
Tyrion, you're with me.

01:11:16.139 --> 01:11:17.006
Okay,

01:11:18.241 --> 01:11:19.275
let's get moving.

01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:44.901
What are you doing here, again?

01:11:45.869 --> 01:11:47.371
I see beyond the things.

01:11:53.610 --> 01:11:55.044
You have to get out of here.

01:11:55.945 --> 01:11:56.979
They are coming.

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:58.147
What if it's a trap?

01:11:59.783 --> 01:12:00.650
No,

01:12:02.218 --> 01:12:03.186
I trust him.

01:12:06.322 --> 01:12:09.025
Good, 'cause there is no time.

01:12:10.627 --> 01:12:11.495
Go.

01:12:32.682 --> 01:12:33.717
Go, hurry!

01:12:36.052 --> 01:12:38.153
What are you waiting for?
Don't let them get away!

01:12:38.154 --> 01:12:39.655
After them, go!

01:12:41.157 --> 01:12:42.325
Hiya, yeah!

01:12:58.642 --> 01:12:59.776
Yeah, yeah!

01:13:19.195 --> 01:13:20.929
We have
to split up, run!

01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:23.566
We meet again at the
pass of the falls.

01:13:23.567 --> 01:13:25.535
Run, fly, go!

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:18.187
This way.

01:14:23.059 --> 01:14:24.961
The waterfall pass
is on the right.

01:14:25.895 --> 01:14:26.763
Trust me.

01:14:28.264 --> 01:14:29.966
We will get there
soon from here,

01:14:32.869 --> 01:14:34.470
but we have to continue on foot.

01:14:39.943 --> 01:14:40.810
Thank you.

01:14:45.949 --> 01:14:47.416
For believing me.

01:14:51.387 --> 01:14:52.255
Come on.

01:15:02.198 --> 01:15:03.066
Shh.

01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:16.179
We need to hide the horses.

01:15:17.714 --> 01:15:18.582
Go.

01:15:59.589 --> 01:16:01.524
I think they're gone.

01:16:12.101 --> 01:16:17.140
♪ I'm slowly drifting to

01:16:17.373 --> 01:16:22.411
♪ You

01:16:26.883 --> 01:16:28.516
♪ The stars and the planets

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:30.920
Suddenly,
it was all so easy.

01:16:32.021 --> 01:16:35.591
Me, him, us,

01:16:37.060 --> 01:16:39.427
as if we'd always been together.

01:16:39.428 --> 01:16:41.329
Yet our lives have just crossed

01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:44.099
like two arrows shot in
the opposite direction.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:47.536
So fast, so different,

01:16:48.705 --> 01:16:49.939
but linked by something.

01:16:53.009 --> 01:16:54.810
♪ I'm on my way

01:16:54.811 --> 01:17:00.382
♪ I'm on

01:17:50.033 --> 01:17:52.401
I have to go back to Brea.

01:17:53.870 --> 01:17:55.571
I'll talk to my dad.

01:17:57.573 --> 01:18:00.042
And Roland will pay for
everything he did.

01:18:00.043 --> 01:18:02.945
Yet when something
is too good,

01:18:02.946 --> 01:18:04.313
you're afraid to live it.

01:18:06.249 --> 01:18:08.016
And what do you do?

01:18:08.017 --> 01:18:09.217
Hey.

01:18:09.218 --> 01:18:12.220
Look, you need to
go back to Brea,

01:18:12.221 --> 01:18:13.122
to your father.

01:18:15.091 --> 01:18:17.026
-  What?
- And never show up again.

01:18:18.594 --> 01:18:20.263
Hey, are you serious?

01:18:30.606 --> 01:18:31.474
Go away.

01:18:43.419 --> 01:18:47.289
Run, Diana. Run away.

01:18:47.290 --> 01:18:48.891
Sometimes it takes so little

01:18:48.892 --> 01:18:50.293
to make us children again.

01:18:51.660 --> 01:18:54.497
And the only security
is to flee far away.

01:18:55.865 --> 01:18:58.968
Happiness is not part
of this world.

01:19:31.067 --> 01:19:33.802
You should not be here.

01:19:33.803 --> 01:19:36.638
Why did you come to see me

01:19:36.639 --> 01:19:39.843
like a thief so late at night?

01:19:42.678 --> 01:19:44.680
The Baelian brothers
had the little girl.

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:46.549
I talked to Diana.

01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:49.651
They did not kidnap her,

01:19:49.652 --> 01:19:51.554
and much less they
want to kill her.

01:19:52.355 --> 01:19:55.357
They are protecting her
from Nistrol and his men.

01:19:55.358 --> 01:19:59.062
Roland
- Stop right there.

01:20:00.897 --> 01:20:02.565
I don't want to hear it.

01:20:05.168 --> 01:20:08.137
One thing I ask you to do,

01:20:09.505 --> 01:20:11.407
and you couldn't do it for me.

01:20:16.579 --> 01:20:17.746
I understand.

01:20:20.449 --> 01:20:22.618
I must join this expedition.

01:20:24.787 --> 01:20:26.221
We have to do the right thing.

01:20:26.222 --> 01:20:29.257
No, we do the things
we have to do,

01:20:29.258 --> 01:20:31.294
for the good of our family.

01:20:32.195 --> 01:20:34.463
Do you think I am stupid?

01:20:35.932 --> 01:20:39.501
Lord Roland's story
leaks everywhere.

01:20:39.502 --> 01:20:41.736
We must do everything we can

01:20:41.737 --> 01:20:44.407
for the safety of our family.

01:20:46.275 --> 01:20:51.314
Politics does not work
by doing the right thing,

01:20:51.414 --> 01:20:53.950
or following our hearts.

01:20:56.285 --> 01:21:00.656
I should have known
that my bastard son

01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:03.625
would not have the guts

01:21:03.626 --> 01:21:05.761
to do what he was told to do.

01:21:09.065 --> 01:21:09.933
So,

01:21:10.900 --> 01:21:11.767
you go now.

01:21:13.602 --> 01:21:17.506
Don't come back until
you are on my side.

01:21:19.909 --> 01:21:21.244
If you are arrested,

01:21:22.245 --> 01:21:23.146
remember:

01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:26.615
you are not my son

01:21:29.452 --> 01:21:31.154
and never have been.

01:21:45.268 --> 01:21:46.734
Captain.

01:21:46.735 --> 01:21:48.570
One of our scouts spotted
the Baelians,

01:21:48.571 --> 01:21:49.905
less than a mile from us.

01:21:54.477 --> 01:21:55.344
Perfect.

01:21:56.279 --> 01:21:57.146
We ride.

01:22:03.719 --> 01:22:06.454
No, we'll leave
the horses here

01:22:06.455 --> 01:22:08.256
and we'll cut up the
valley on foot

01:22:08.257 --> 01:22:11.827
and meet them head
on, like warriors.

01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:15.498
Move out!

01:22:43.192 --> 01:22:45.061
Lord Goran, My Lord.

01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:47.730
Lord Goran.

01:22:56.472 --> 01:22:58.073
Whoa.

01:22:58.074 --> 01:22:59.008
What is it?

01:23:05.148 --> 01:23:06.515
Looks like Leland.

01:23:08.284 --> 01:23:10.919
Looks like him and
Captain Hardin made up.

01:23:13.856 --> 01:23:14.922
How could he do that

01:23:14.923 --> 01:23:17.425
after what Hardin did
to Tristan, though?

01:23:17.426 --> 01:23:20.528
How could he do what
he's done to any of us?

01:23:20.529 --> 01:23:22.031
We need to leave the horses.

01:23:23.132 --> 01:23:24.533
It will help us move faster.

01:23:35.244 --> 01:23:36.112
Go.

01:23:38.814 --> 01:23:39.615
Come on!

01:24:11.914 --> 01:24:12.748
Stay down.

01:25:01.330 --> 01:25:03.999
How does it feel to
betray your own people?

01:25:06.602 --> 01:25:08.803
Put down your sword, Tyrion.

01:25:08.804 --> 01:25:10.004
Let us pass

01:25:10.005 --> 01:25:11.639
and I will spare you
the indignity

01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:14.343
of murdering you right
here, right now.

01:25:23.552 --> 01:25:25.488
I can't let you pass, Captain.

01:25:28.191 --> 01:25:30.759
And you and what army
is gonna stop me?

01:25:31.794 --> 01:25:33.762
And even if you could,
Tyrion, why?

01:25:35.698 --> 01:25:38.234
You must do the right thing.

01:25:39.868 --> 01:25:41.404
The Baelian brothers

01:25:43.038 --> 01:25:44.573
tried to save the little girl,

01:25:46.175 --> 01:25:47.042
from Nistrol

01:25:49.245 --> 01:25:50.579
and Lord Roland.

01:25:53.382 --> 01:25:54.583
Lord Roland?

01:25:56.252 --> 01:26:00.889
It was Lord Roland who
planned the death of the king.

01:26:03.091 --> 01:26:04.860
We are hunting the wrong man.

01:26:05.694 --> 01:26:07.129
You are a liar!

01:26:11.267 --> 01:26:14.236
This poor bastard's words

01:26:14.237 --> 01:26:16.204
have been influenced

01:26:16.205 --> 01:26:19.242
by that whore Diana Baelian.

01:26:20.576 --> 01:26:21.910
He fell in love with her.

01:26:26.682 --> 01:26:27.716
That true, Tyrion?

01:26:28.784 --> 01:26:30.553
You're doing all this
for a woman?

01:26:43.766 --> 01:26:44.633
Yes.

01:26:45.968 --> 01:26:48.170
I fell in love, it's true.

01:26:51.106 --> 01:26:52.808
But there is no lie.

01:26:55.278 --> 01:26:58.414
She told the truth
about Lord Roland.

01:27:10.826 --> 01:27:12.595
Arrest this poor fool.

01:27:14.663 --> 01:27:15.798
Take him back to Brea.

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:19.935
He'll serve in prison for
life for his betrayal.

01:27:53.636 --> 01:27:54.802
You go ahead.

01:27:54.803 --> 01:27:55.871
I have to help him.

01:27:56.772 --> 01:27:58.640
Take the little girl
to the Dog's Pass

01:27:58.641 --> 01:28:00.475
and wait for me there.

01:28:00.476 --> 01:28:03.010
- I'm coming with you.
- No.

01:28:03.011 --> 01:28:03.912
No.

01:28:07.015 --> 01:28:08.150
Be careful.

01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:33.569
Run, boy. Run!

01:30:14.076 --> 01:30:14.943
No.

01:30:30.526 --> 01:30:33.629
They would've killed
you right away

01:30:36.298 --> 01:30:38.934
if I had not said those things.

01:30:42.805 --> 01:30:44.607
Don't say anything.

01:30:45.641 --> 01:30:46.609
My sword.

01:31:05.327 --> 01:31:06.862
I am proud of you,

01:31:09.431 --> 01:31:10.298
my son.

01:31:56.044 --> 01:31:56.912
Tyrion?

01:32:15.731 --> 01:32:17.666
You heard everything
from the hill?

01:32:23.538 --> 01:32:27.009
I don't who you are,
or what you did to me.

01:32:28.911 --> 01:32:33.115
But yes, I feel something
too strong for you.

01:32:35.718 --> 01:32:39.755
And maybe I would have
done this for you anyway.

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:54.803
I told you
not to come back.

01:33:00.809 --> 01:33:02.076
What?

01:33:02.077 --> 01:33:03.410
Nothing.

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:05.313
Now, we must continue.

01:33:06.181 --> 01:33:08.015
- You're hurt.
- No, I'm good.

01:33:08.016 --> 01:33:10.151
I'm good.
- You can't.

01:33:10.152 --> 01:33:12.219
I can continue.

01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:15.624
Tyrion, I need you
to go back to town.

01:33:20.028 --> 01:33:22.330
It's the second time
that you kicked me out.

01:33:24.399 --> 01:33:26.701
Please, Tyrion.

01:33:26.702 --> 01:33:27.602
I,

01:33:28.771 --> 01:33:29.604
What?

01:33:32.074 --> 01:33:35.010
I need you to go back
and you'll be fine.

01:33:36.645 --> 01:33:38.379
We will meet again

01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:40.715
over the river Moyan
between two moons,

01:33:40.716 --> 01:33:41.917
as soon as you recover.

01:33:45.420 --> 01:33:46.588
What are you saying?

01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:53.428
I'm not
good with words.

01:34:09.577 --> 01:34:12.781
All right. My horse
will take me back to town.

01:34:15.684 --> 01:34:18.386
Captain Hardin and Nistrol
are climbing the mountain.

01:34:19.254 --> 01:34:20.655
You have to protect Lily.

01:34:25.093 --> 01:34:25.961
Go.

01:34:33.235 --> 01:34:34.502
And be careful.

01:34:53.255 --> 01:34:55.222
They passed through here.

01:34:55.223 --> 01:34:57.359
This is the exact road
I would've taken.

01:34:58.827 --> 01:35:01.196
We need to cut through
here, to the other side.

01:35:02.965 --> 01:35:04.531
No, no, no. We should
stick on this trail.

01:35:04.532 --> 01:35:05.968
We're right on their heels.

01:35:07.169 --> 01:35:08.770
If we go through this gorge,

01:35:08.771 --> 01:35:11.106
we'll be there before
them and surprise them.

01:35:12.174 --> 01:35:13.307
They're my men, captain.

01:35:13.308 --> 01:35:14.376
That's why I'm here.

01:35:16.144 --> 01:35:17.645
You need to trust me on this.

01:35:19.815 --> 01:35:20.682
Trust me.

01:35:22.017 --> 01:35:23.350
I know them in these mountains

01:35:23.351 --> 01:35:25.020
better than the back of my hand.

01:35:43.906 --> 01:35:44.773
All right.

01:35:46.674 --> 01:35:47.542
Right, lead on.

01:36:30.252 --> 01:36:33.155
It was either you
or me, Hardin.

01:36:49.972 --> 01:36:51.205
You go ahead to the hill

01:36:51.206 --> 01:36:52.841
and send someone to the valley.

01:36:55.743 --> 01:36:57.312
I'll stop at the meeting point.

01:36:59.281 --> 01:37:00.949
They've arrived at the gorges.

01:37:02.150 --> 01:37:03.618
We must continue to climb.

01:37:05.153 --> 01:37:06.121
Everything good?

01:37:10.425 --> 01:37:11.293
Yeah.

01:37:13.195 --> 01:37:14.897
They can't be far
behind us, now.

01:37:16.164 --> 01:37:17.332
We need to keep moving.

01:37:19.034 --> 01:37:19.902
Let's split up.

01:37:20.936 --> 01:37:23.138
Jack, you go down the
valley with Lily

01:37:23.972 --> 01:37:25.407
until we get to Nora's River

01:37:26.374 --> 01:37:27.909
and we will continue to climb,

01:37:27.910 --> 01:37:29.144
until we reach the top.

01:37:30.112 --> 01:37:31.579
That should buy us some time.

01:37:39.387 --> 01:37:41.256
Yeah, it could work.

01:37:42.657 --> 01:37:44.359
Just try not to leave
any tracks.

01:38:10.152 --> 01:38:11.019
What happened?

01:38:14.856 --> 01:38:16.058
It's a long story.

01:38:18.093 --> 01:38:19.227
I had to take him out.

01:38:23.598 --> 01:38:25.033
They're up on the hill.

01:38:26.234 --> 01:38:28.203
We need to go up there.

01:38:30.372 --> 01:38:32.706
Let's do this.

01:38:54.362 --> 01:38:55.563
Remember us?

01:40:47.342 --> 01:40:49.377
They're in the valley.

01:40:54.416 --> 01:40:55.783
Blow the horn!

01:41:06.994 --> 01:41:08.230
The Baelians.

01:41:09.030 --> 01:41:10.898
You kill the Baelians,

01:41:12.567 --> 01:41:13.834
and I'll kill the girl.

01:41:13.835 --> 01:41:14.836
With me!

01:41:27.182 --> 01:41:28.150
This way!

01:41:40.295 --> 01:41:41.995
There they are.

01:41:41.996 --> 01:41:43.498
Go, get 'em. Go!

01:42:14.596 --> 01:42:15.630
To the hill.

01:43:40.782 --> 01:43:42.550
They must not escape!

01:43:46.954 --> 01:43:48.523
I'm running out of arrows.

01:43:57.765 --> 01:43:58.833
Help Jack and Lily.

01:44:01.936 --> 01:44:03.505
I'll try and hold him off here.

01:44:09.811 --> 01:44:10.678
No.

01:44:13.615 --> 01:44:16.083
It's the right thing to do.

01:44:29.597 --> 01:44:30.465
Go.

01:46:16.604 --> 01:46:17.739
Go get him.

01:47:07.855 --> 01:47:10.424
So you still have
nothing to say, old friend?

01:47:29.410 --> 01:47:30.778
The happy lover.

01:47:40.087 --> 01:47:40.955
Come on.

01:48:54.896 --> 01:48:56.263
Kill the girl!

01:49:12.246 --> 01:49:13.114
Guston.

01:49:15.016 --> 01:49:15.883
Guston.

01:52:35.016 --> 01:52:37.918
Good to see you again, Diana.

01:52:37.919 --> 01:52:39.519
So, here we are.

01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:44.158
Who would've thought I would
end up having to kill you?

01:52:47.428 --> 01:52:49.695
You were like a
father to us all.

01:52:49.696 --> 01:52:51.898
But you betrayed
us, you used us.

01:52:51.899 --> 01:52:54.535
Your people, your brothers. Me!

01:53:14.521 --> 01:53:16.957
This is what Tristan
and Oliver,

01:53:16.958 --> 01:53:19.125
and this is for Tyrion.

01:53:51.292 --> 01:53:52.159
Diana.

01:53:55.329 --> 01:53:56.197
No. No.

01:53:59.967 --> 01:54:01.402
Diana.

01:54:04.205 --> 01:54:05.072
I,

01:54:20.454 --> 01:54:21.288
love you.

01:54:23.124 --> 01:54:24.158
Thank you.

01:54:33.067 --> 01:54:36.170
♪ Here I am

01:56:10.531 --> 01:56:12.798
Here we are, Lily.

01:56:12.799 --> 01:56:14.235
You and me,

01:56:15.702 --> 01:56:17.038
who would've thought that?

01:56:19.173 --> 01:56:20.407
Perhaps you already know

01:56:21.275 --> 01:56:23.277
that there comes a
time in our life

01:56:24.511 --> 01:56:28.049
when you do the math of
everything that has been,

01:56:30.017 --> 01:56:31.152
how it could have been,

01:56:32.753 --> 01:56:37.390
and what it's now.

01:56:37.391 --> 01:56:40.727
And so, little Lily was
welcomed by Nora's women;

01:56:42.029 --> 01:56:44.165
the ancient kingdom
north of Brea.

01:57:09.790 --> 01:57:11.492
You're finally free,

01:57:13.127 --> 01:57:14.694
but everything we experienced

01:57:14.695 --> 01:57:16.529
had changed us forever.

01:57:16.530 --> 01:57:20.134
The loss of John, the
death of Tyrion.

01:57:25.572 --> 01:57:29.976
Someone once said, "We
become what we choose."

01:57:32.979 --> 01:57:36.783
And that night, for the
first time in our life,

01:57:37.951 --> 01:57:41.821
we had chosen to do
the right thing.
