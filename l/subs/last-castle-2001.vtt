00:29.947 --> 00:32.313
Take a look at a castle, any castle.

00:33.325 --> 00:36.032
Now break down the key elements
that make it a castle.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.903
They haven't changed in a thousand years.

00:39.414 --> 00:40.995
One, location.

00:41.333 --> 00:45.201
A site on high ground that commands
the territory as far as the eye can see.

00:46.171 --> 00:48.332
Two, protection, big walls.

00:48.757 --> 00:51.373
Walls strong enough
fo withstand a frontal attack.

00:51.552 --> 00:55.340
Three, a Garrison.
Men who are trained and willing to kill.

00:56.098 --> 00:58.009
Four, a flag.

00:58.809 --> 01:01.516
You tell your men,
"you're soldiers and that's our flag.”

01:02.062 --> 01:04.269
You tell them, "nobody takes our flag.”

01:04.355 --> 01:06.688
- One step forward.
- Forward!

01:09.903 --> 01:13.270
And you raise that flag so it flies
high where everyone can see it.

01:16.785 --> 01:19.401
Now you've got yourself a castle.

01:20.122 --> 01:22.864
The only difference
between this castle and all the rest

01:23.166 --> 01:25.122
is that they were built
fo keep people out.

01:25.460 --> 01:28.167
This castle is built to keep people in.

01:40.934 --> 01:42.140
All inmatftes...

02:09.253 --> 02:11.586
- Come on. Give me the ball.
- What up, bitch?

02:11.673 --> 02:13.834
Come on.
Give me the fucking ball.

02:14.176 --> 02:15.416
Fuck you!

02:18.180 --> 02:19.180
Sir?

02:20.557 --> 02:23.264
Sir? A movement order just came in.

02:23.352 --> 02:24.888
Give it to captain peretz.

02:25.103 --> 02:28.891
- I'll take that, Sheila.
- It's a "category a" transfer.

02:30.984 --> 02:31.894
Let me see it.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.476
You motherfucker. Fuck you.

02:37.824 --> 02:39.940
- Fall out! Fall out!
- Play ball, man.

02:40.702 --> 02:41.702
Come on.

02:43.705 --> 02:44.945
1700 hours?

02:48.043 --> 02:49.999
No, no, we're prepared.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.881
Well, it's just really fast. Okay.

03:00.681 --> 03:03.639
All right.
You sure you're positive about this?

03:05.477 --> 03:06.933
Okay. Thank you.

03:08.563 --> 03:09.563
Sir?

03:11.775 --> 03:12.775
Sir?

03:14.820 --> 03:16.105
It's the real deal.

03:16.738 --> 03:18.899
He is coming in at 1700 hours.

03:21.993 --> 03:23.824
1700 hours today?

03:24.621 --> 03:26.111
That's what they said, sir.

03:29.710 --> 03:32.122
I don't understand.
The trial began today.

03:33.004 --> 03:35.290
Apparently, he plead guilty
and got ten years.

03:35.382 --> 03:37.543
They're expediting
his transfer as a courtesy.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.419
Oh, as a courtesy?

03:41.179 --> 03:43.465
They should be naming a base
after the man,

03:43.557 --> 03:44.888
not sending him here.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.266
My god, Eugene irwin.

03:57.404 --> 03:59.986
We have verdict.
We have a sentence. We have a prisoner.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.108
We do our job...

04:02.492 --> 04:03.982
Whether we like it or not.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.537
Puts us on our toes, though, doesn't it?

04:37.486 --> 04:40.353
Escort delall report to gate 18 prisoner.

04:40.447 --> 04:42.813
Escort detail meet the prisoner
on gate a.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.259
I give him a week.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.054
- 'Till what?
- 'Till he scrags himself.

05:16.399 --> 05:19.891
The court-martial didn't put him over
the edge, I guarantee this shithouse will.

05:20.153 --> 05:21.814
- A week?
- Six bundles.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.691
Six? Let's make it ten.

05:23.782 --> 05:26.319
- All right. Make it ten then.
- There we go.

05:26.409 --> 05:29.776
Ten bundles, Mr. dellwo.
Very specific man.

05:29.871 --> 05:30.871
Anybody else?

05:30.956 --> 05:33.267
You guys have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

05:33.291 --> 05:36.954
We'll make it like the final four.
Ten bundles a square. Who's in?

05:38.588 --> 05:42.297
I'm not going to bet on whether or not
a man's going to kill himself.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.753
That's some creepy shit, pilot.

05:46.388 --> 05:50.051
Besides, look at him. One week?
He's tougher than that.

05:50.433 --> 05:52.970
How much tougher,
eight, ten, what?

05:53.395 --> 05:55.977
- Eight.
- Anyone else?

05:56.898 --> 06:00.686
- You're an ice-cold motherfucker, yates.
- I'm not betting he's gonna off himself.

06:00.777 --> 06:03.860
- I'm just playing the books.
- And you, cutbush? I know you're in.

06:04.990 --> 06:07.859
- I say a week and a half.
- A week and a half?

06:07.951 --> 06:09.407
- Wallace?
- Go ahead.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.323
I have the transfer, a,
to the p.R.U. Now.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.573
- Copy that. P.R.U.
- One wallet. Leather.

06:17.210 --> 06:19.201
- Family photos?
- My daughter.

06:21.923 --> 06:24.289
- Grandson.
- Would you like to keep these?

06:24.676 --> 06:26.337
That's an authorized item.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.881
I'd appreciate that.

06:29.514 --> 06:33.052
One set of keys. Glasses.

06:33.810 --> 06:35.721
I'm going to need your ring.

06:39.482 --> 06:40.562
Thank you.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.523
Actually, you can keep that.
Academy rings are authorized.

06:53.663 --> 06:58.282
Three stars, two sets.
Looks like that's everything.

06:58.835 --> 06:59.995
So...

07:02.672 --> 07:05.004
Sir? Prisoner irwin is outside.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.259
Five minutes.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.221
Five minutes.

07:15.226 --> 07:17.057
You can put that down if you want.

07:19.314 --> 07:20.975
- You talking to me?
- Yes.

07:37.499 --> 07:38.909
I know what you're thinking.

07:39.584 --> 07:41.950
Do I salute you,
or do you salute me?

07:42.337 --> 07:43.793
Well, the answer is neither.

07:44.673 --> 07:47.756
My men salute me, of course,
and each other according to rank.

07:47.842 --> 07:50.675
But there is no saluting by
the general prison population.

07:55.100 --> 07:57.341
Well, first things first.
Are you hungry?

07:58.019 --> 07:59.475
- No.
- Are you sure?

07:59.562 --> 08:01.678
Mondays are our Salisbury steak night.

08:02.899 --> 08:05.060
- Always a cause for celebration.
- Indeed.

08:05.443 --> 08:09.106
Indeed. May I offer you some lemonade?

08:10.156 --> 08:13.023
- Thank you.
- Just be a minute, sir.

08:13.994 --> 08:16.235
- Prisoner aguilar...
- If you'll step over here,

08:16.329 --> 08:18.991
I'll give you
a basic layout of the facility.

08:20.333 --> 08:23.040
The building we're in now
is the administration building.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.709
That building there
houses the tiers.

08:25.797 --> 08:29.665
That's where you
and the other inmates will live.

08:31.052 --> 08:33.885
The building next to it is the laundry,
where I've had you assigned.

08:36.558 --> 08:39.515
That is the old blockhouse wall.

08:39.602 --> 08:42.684
Its all thats left
of the original prison from the 1870s.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.292
I could've removed it,
but I thought it was important to keep

08:45.316 --> 08:48.433
a sense of history,
so I asked the men fo rebuild it

08:49.070 --> 08:52.858
they seem to enjoy it.
It's a matter of some pride now.

08:53.992 --> 08:54.992
Sir?

08:55.243 --> 08:57.404
Yes? Please, on the table there.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.039
Please.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.164
Come on. Let's go.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.997
I personally meet with every new
inmate here at the prison.

09:11.342 --> 09:15.836
Usually downstairs.
And I ask them a question.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.514
What do you expect
from your time here at the castle?

09:21.436 --> 09:22.436
Nothing.

09:23.021 --> 09:24.977
Just to do my time and go home.

09:26.941 --> 09:29.808
Perfect.
That is the perfect answer.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.902
Now I have what may seem
under the circumstances,

09:36.993 --> 09:38.779
a bizarre request.

09:38.870 --> 09:42.488
I have a collection
of most of the seminal books on warfare,

09:42.582 --> 09:45.324
including 7he burden of command.

09:46.044 --> 09:48.706
I was wondering if you would do me
the honor of signing it?

09:49.756 --> 09:51.166
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.340
Captain peretz.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.793
- Yes, sir?
- Two minutes.

10:11.986 --> 10:13.146
That's impressive.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.979
Yeah. It's a great collection, isn't it?

10:19.702 --> 10:20.987
Yeah, sure.

10:24.457 --> 10:27.949
That's a minié ball from Shiloh,
used in battle.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.285
Grant lost 13,000 men at Shiloh.

10:33.258 --> 10:34.794
Suppose this got one of 'em?

10:35.552 --> 10:37.588
Never know. Do you?

10:38.388 --> 10:41.004
I mean, do you collect anything?

10:41.808 --> 10:42.808
No.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.600
Some coins
from the countries I've traveled to.

10:45.687 --> 10:47.894
My father didn't care
for military collections.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.396
I guess it stuck with me.

10:52.026 --> 10:55.939
Any man with a collection like this is a
man who's never set foot on a battlefield.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.982
To him, a minié ball
from Shiloh is just an artifact.

11:01.828 --> 11:05.662
And to a combat vet,
it's a hunk of metal

11:05.748 --> 11:07.989
that caused some poor bastard
a world of pain.

11:13.006 --> 11:16.419
I must have mis-shelved it,
your book.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.708
We'll do it another time.

11:18.970 --> 11:20.926
No, please, please. Allow me.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.507
Sir, lights out in five.
Do I hold the lock?

11:25.602 --> 11:29.186
No. No. We are...
We're through here.

11:37.906 --> 11:39.737
Prisoner aguilar,
what are you doing?

11:40.491 --> 11:43.153
You do not salute this man,
this man has no rank.

11:43.494 --> 11:45.530
Saluting amongst prisoners is prohibited.

11:46.206 --> 11:49.664
Yes, sir.
But I was saluting you.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.495
Take the prisoners
to their cells, captain.

11:55.590 --> 11:56.590
Yes, sir.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.590
Thank you for your hospitality, colonel.

11:59.928 --> 12:01.088
You're welcome.

12:03.097 --> 12:07.306
Inmates,
one step fo the rear... hall!

12:08.311 --> 12:09.801
Shut the doors!

12:12.315 --> 12:14.681
You're gonna be in cell 345.

12:16.819 --> 12:19.310
You get to shower every other day.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.320
Okay, hold up.

12:23.034 --> 12:24.820
You fuck! I'm going to kill you!

12:24.911 --> 12:26.321
Shut up, beaupre.

12:26.663 --> 12:28.745
We're gonna show you right now.

12:29.165 --> 12:31.451
Do not cross the yellow line
while in formation.

12:31.542 --> 12:34.382
During the day you're free to be
in the area we're walking in right now.

12:34.796 --> 12:35.956
Showers on both sides.

12:36.047 --> 12:38.003
Those stars don't mean shit now, do they?

12:38.091 --> 12:41.208
You're allowed one book in your cell,
in addition to the Bible.

12:41.552 --> 12:43.292
Go up here, then make a right.

12:43.596 --> 12:46.053
- I've got eight bundles on you!
- Let's see...

12:46.266 --> 12:50.225
No, you got to hold out for five weeks,
then kill yourself!

12:50.395 --> 12:51.475
Was on Monday.

12:53.314 --> 12:56.772
- Three-four-five, man.
- Crash 345.

12:58.403 --> 13:01.110
- That's right!
- All right, general.

13:01.990 --> 13:03.070
Kill the whore.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.029
All right, general!

13:09.998 --> 13:12.535
- First call, 0600.
- What'd you do, man?

13:12.875 --> 13:14.081
What are you here for?

13:14.168 --> 13:16.284
- Close 345.
- How many did you kill?

13:35.606 --> 13:37.016
Welcome to the castle, baby!

13:38.234 --> 13:39.234
Sir?

13:41.070 --> 13:42.105
Sir?

13:44.657 --> 13:46.193
Prisoner irwin's in his cell.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.821
He's really something, isn't he?

13:54.625 --> 13:56.365
Would you like
the end-of-day report, sir?

13:59.172 --> 14:01.083
Is everyone
where they're supposed to be?

14:01.591 --> 14:03.582
- Yes, sir.
- Then skip it.

14:06.054 --> 14:10.218
Very good, colonel.
Is there anything else?

14:14.020 --> 14:17.558
Tomorrow, put out only one basketball.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.434
What's up?

14:22.695 --> 14:25.983
- You just hit a brick wall, baby.
- Nigga, why you doin' that shit?

14:26.074 --> 14:27.905
- Come on.
- Get your hands off me!

14:28.034 --> 14:29.240
Come on, bitch!

14:29.327 --> 14:31.113
- What are you doing, boy?
- Come on!

14:38.252 --> 14:39.833
Three-to-one on the little man.

14:43.383 --> 14:46.170
- Stab him! Yeah!
- Come on, thumper. Kill him!

14:47.720 --> 14:48.720
Come on, bitch!

14:50.139 --> 14:51.504
Come on!

14:53.142 --> 14:55.474
- Three on...
- What are you doing?

14:55.853 --> 14:57.764
You don't like it, doc, take a walk.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.346
You're fuckin' sick, yates.

15:02.652 --> 15:04.017
Take down that bastard!

15:09.075 --> 15:11.441
You see how easy it is to manipulate men?

15:13.579 --> 15:15.490
Someone should write a paper on it.

15:27.593 --> 15:28.593
Come on, man!

15:29.345 --> 15:30.425
Whack him now!

15:34.308 --> 15:35.308
Come on, bitch!

15:41.441 --> 15:42.441
Get in there!

15:51.451 --> 15:52.486
Hold.

15:56.747 --> 15:58.203
Come on, get up!

15:58.791 --> 16:00.201
You can't mess with me.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.744
Come on, pick it up bitch.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.288
You can end it.

16:05.715 --> 16:06.795
Get up!

16:10.178 --> 16:13.341
Come on! Come on, bitch!

16:17.226 --> 16:20.138
- End it.
- Sound the horn.

16:26.152 --> 16:27.483
On the ground now!

16:32.742 --> 16:36.030
All inmates remain on the ground
in a prone position.

16:36.621 --> 16:38.657
Get the hell down now!

16:38.748 --> 16:41.160
- Thumper, get down!
- I didn't mean it!

16:41.250 --> 16:43.491
Get down, thumper! Get down!

16:43.586 --> 16:45.668
- Get down, thumper!
- Yes, sir.

16:45.922 --> 16:48.709
All inmates remain on the ground
in a prone position.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.085
No! I didn't do anything!

16:56.265 --> 16:57.425
Thumper, get down!

16:57.517 --> 16:59.178
- I didn't mean it...
- Sound off.

17:10.946 --> 17:12.778
Oh, shit!

17:34.512 --> 17:36.423
- Watch where you're going.
- Kiss my ass!

17:36.514 --> 17:38.379
Don't worry, we'll do it later.

17:43.104 --> 17:46.062
Damn nigger! “What?

17:46.440 --> 17:49.273
- You heard me!
- Say it to my face! Bitch!

17:49.360 --> 17:51.772
I'm gonna kick
your white ass through the air!

17:52.863 --> 17:54.399
Shut the fuck up!

18:02.498 --> 18:05.114
What the fuck you doing, beano? Hey!

18:05.668 --> 18:07.124
What the fuck are you doing?

18:07.920 --> 18:11.378
- The mortar's weak, beaupre.
- Don't worry about it.

18:11.465 --> 18:14.207
Mind your own business.
Cool out, man.

18:14.302 --> 18:18.261
- Shut up or I'll stick this in your neck.
- You'll end up back in the hole.

18:18.431 --> 18:19.716
Mail-room, mail duty.

18:19.807 --> 18:23.391
- It's all weak.
- Don't worry about the mortar.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.637
- Spit it out.
- My daddy's a Mason.

18:27.773 --> 18:30.105
I don't give a fuck
if your dad built the pyramids.

18:30.234 --> 18:31.724
Whites work the wall, period.

18:31.986 --> 18:35.478
Now, get back on spic duty and bring me
some rocks before I slap you.

18:35.948 --> 18:39.657
- They won't set.
- What did I just tell you?

18:39.744 --> 18:41.109
What'd I just tell you?

18:41.537 --> 18:44.779
We're only doing this to keep
Johnny-fucking-eyeballs off our back.

18:45.166 --> 18:47.953
Don't make me tell you again,
you simple prick. Back the fuck off!

18:48.044 --> 18:50.410
Beaupre! Knock it off.

18:53.924 --> 18:56.836
What? Big hero.

18:57.678 --> 18:59.634
Don't worry about me
going back to the hole.

19:21.786 --> 19:22.946
How you doing?

19:29.669 --> 19:32.957
You probably don't remember me,
but I served under you in the Gulf.

19:34.840 --> 19:37.297
Dr. Thomas Bernard, 33rd medical unit.

19:38.469 --> 19:39.584
That's right.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.715
Actually, it's Lee Bernard,
but close enough.

19:44.642 --> 19:48.385
You were arrested possession
of hashish, as I remember.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.971
- Right.
- It was a small amount, as I recall.

19:52.066 --> 19:54.773
- You don't get sent here for that.
- No, no. You don't.

19:55.069 --> 19:57.526
There's more to it than that.
Hey, thumper!

20:01.992 --> 20:04.699
- I was able to get you an aspirin.
- Thanks.

20:07.123 --> 20:09.284
I got shot with a real bullet once, doc.

20:09.750 --> 20:10.990
Didn't hurt this much.

20:11.419 --> 20:12.784
That's the upside of real bullets,

20:12.878 --> 20:14.960
they cut through flesh,
hit fewer nerve endings.

20:15.339 --> 20:16.624
Downside is they kill you.

20:17.466 --> 20:20.549
Of course, so do
the rubber ones sometimes.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.126
Hell of a downside.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.636
Doc, you think I might get
one of them purple hearts?

20:25.683 --> 20:29.016
Absolutely, thumper. Take it easy.
I'll try to get you more.

20:29.770 --> 20:33.513
You know winter played us with that
one basketball shit? Come on, man.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.054
- General, sir.
- Don't call me sir.

20:40.114 --> 20:41.445
I'm not a general anymore.

20:41.991 --> 20:44.232
- Can we at least talk to you?
- About what?

20:44.326 --> 20:46.112
You got friends in the Pentagon, right?

20:46.412 --> 20:47.412
You could talk to them.

20:49.582 --> 20:51.413
I'm a little hazy on the subject.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.812
What happened here today
happens here all the time, sir.

20:53.836 --> 20:55.647
Let me get this straight.
You mean there's violence?

20:55.671 --> 20:56.831
Yeah.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.693
- In a prison full with violent criminals.
- That's not what I'm saying.

20:59.717 --> 21:02.880
No. There's been...
How many this year, doc?

21:03.637 --> 21:06.003
13 men down, 11 of them
were critical injuries...

21:06.098 --> 21:08.384
Stop your fucking whining.
Listen to yourselves.

21:09.226 --> 21:11.763
Then he only gives us the most
basic medical treatment.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.890
Completely substandard services.

21:13.981 --> 21:17.064
Substandard services?
Yes. Substandard services.

21:17.151 --> 21:18.357
It's fucked-up shit, man.

21:19.862 --> 21:24.026
I had a friend in Hanoi,
who had to repair his own fractured tibia.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.697
You cannot compare what went on

21:25.785 --> 21:27.776
in a foreign pow camp 30 years ago...

21:27.870 --> 21:29.280
No, you can't compare.

21:30.247 --> 21:33.739
I've led real soldiers
in more difficult situations than this.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.620
But you're not
real soldiers anymore,

21:36.420 --> 21:37.626
and neither am I.

21:42.218 --> 21:43.583
There've been murders.

21:46.514 --> 21:49.176
Do you know what happens
when you take a rubber bullet to the head?

21:49.767 --> 21:51.098
The lights go out.

21:51.769 --> 21:54.055
Twice in the last year
there've been accidents,

21:54.230 --> 21:56.596
men have been hit
in the head and killed.

21:56.690 --> 21:57.805
Nothing can be proven.

21:57.900 --> 22:01.108
We're talking about expert marksmen
shooting from minimal distances.

22:01.195 --> 22:03.652
The guards say the guy turned
his head and boom.

22:03.906 --> 22:07.694
It's not a random thing. You get on
winter's bad side, you're done.

22:07.910 --> 22:10.196
When you're doing
combat duty, after a while,

22:11.705 --> 22:14.572
life just becomes... snapshots.

22:15.125 --> 22:16.865
Most of them horrible.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.626
But not all of them.

22:19.713 --> 22:25.333
Three years ago in Bosnia, I was driving
a small unit through an ifor town.

22:25.636 --> 22:27.001
I saw something interesting.

22:27.096 --> 22:30.054
I saw an old man
sitting on a bombed-out porch,

22:30.140 --> 22:33.132
playing a game of dominoes
with what I presume is his grandson.

22:33.853 --> 22:37.345
When I saw that I thought,
"you know, it's my turn."

22:38.649 --> 22:40.685
I didn't retire after that as I should've.

22:40.943 --> 22:42.524
I took one last assignment.

22:44.113 --> 22:45.444
It was a mistake.

22:46.740 --> 22:48.605
So, gentlemen, I'm done.

22:49.243 --> 22:52.201
I'm not fighting anyone
or anything anymore.

22:52.621 --> 22:55.454
I'm doing my time here,
I'm going home, and god willing,

22:56.333 --> 22:58.436
I'm going to sit on the porch
and play a game of dominoes

22:58.460 --> 23:00.200
with my grandson, who I've never met.

23:02.631 --> 23:04.087
I fucking told you, doc.

23:04.466 --> 23:08.084
You call a three-star general "man"?
Why don't you call him "dude"?

23:11.390 --> 23:15.258
Attention, inmates, the library
will close early at 1700 hours.

23:15.644 --> 23:18.306
The library will close
early tonight at 1700 hours.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.560
- Watch yourself, snitch.
- Yates, everything all right?

23:21.775 --> 23:23.515
- Okay.
- My boy say you got a nice ass.

23:23.611 --> 23:26.648
I got a guy in 129,
way behind, telling me stories.

23:26.739 --> 23:28.320
- How late is he?
- Three weeks.

23:28.574 --> 23:30.485
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I'm telling you now.

23:32.536 --> 23:35.949
Yates, no way that was a touchdown, baby.
That was a fucked-up call.

23:36.040 --> 23:39.578
Keep that shit on the down-low.
They're all fucked-up calls.

23:47.968 --> 23:48.968
How you doing?

23:51.347 --> 23:53.429
So we lost: 22 to 20.

23:54.808 --> 23:55.968
Army-Navy game.

23:56.727 --> 23:57.807
Class of '92.

24:06.904 --> 24:09.941
I met you once...
When I was a kid.

24:10.574 --> 24:14.908
1981. It was a welcome-back celebration
at the white house for the pows.

24:15.412 --> 24:17.027
My father was with you in Hanoi.

24:17.498 --> 24:19.238
- What's your name?
- Y ates.

24:19.917 --> 24:21.498
Yates? Sam yates”?

24:21.835 --> 24:22.870
That's right.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.537
- Good man.
- Nah, he wasn't.

24:26.799 --> 24:28.960
After 30 years, everyone's a good man.

24:30.427 --> 24:31.427
It's the law.

24:33.222 --> 24:34.758
How is he? How's your dad?

24:35.474 --> 24:36.839
Not too good. He's dead.

24:38.852 --> 24:40.183
I'm sorry. What happened?

24:41.271 --> 24:42.306
Came home.

24:43.357 --> 24:48.272
Billingworth, irwin, Jacobson, mcla...

24:51.407 --> 24:54.399
You're late. You have
five minutes left to find your visitor.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.075
Five minutes left.

24:58.747 --> 25:00.703
Eugene irwin, he used to be a general.

25:01.250 --> 25:03.832
Who cares? Seriously, man.

25:04.712 --> 25:05.712
Rosalie?

25:07.631 --> 25:08.871
=o

25:11.677 --> 25:14.293
- It's good of you to come.
- Thank you.

25:15.806 --> 25:17.512
Was it hard getting here?

25:19.101 --> 25:20.557
I missed a turn.

25:23.439 --> 25:24.975
It's just good to see you.

25:27.276 --> 25:29.437
- How's Ben? Good?
- Fine.

25:29.820 --> 25:33.654
- School okay? Grades?
- Well, he's in first grade.

25:35.868 --> 25:38.280
- Well, do you have a picture of him?
- No.

25:40.164 --> 25:44.032
The one I have is two years old.
He must've changed a lot since then.

25:46.253 --> 25:47.493
And how are you, Rosalie?

25:53.886 --> 25:55.296
Look, dad...

25:55.888 --> 25:58.174
- "Look dad"
- I just... I can't do this.

25:59.683 --> 26:01.890
I can't do this
small-talk thing with you.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.640
The whole drive over here
I was trying to think what...

26:07.107 --> 26:09.519
What am I going to say?
What can we talk about beyond

26:09.610 --> 26:13.444
the weather and how's Ben
and I just... went blank.

26:14.990 --> 26:16.855
Do I... do I intimidate you?

26:17.284 --> 26:19.366
- Intimidate me?
- I guess that's the downside

26:19.453 --> 26:23.787
of having a "yes, sir" "no, sir"
military father, but I tried not to...

26:23.874 --> 26:25.489
You weren't a father at all.

26:30.047 --> 26:31.253
God, I'm sorry.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.960
I'm not here to whine or be cruel.

26:36.345 --> 26:37.835
You're a great man.

26:40.641 --> 26:44.304
And... you've done so much
for this country.

26:44.394 --> 26:48.637
- But?
- No. No but. No but.

26:49.858 --> 26:51.394
Just this isn't the place.

26:52.444 --> 26:56.232
Well, it's the only place
I've got right now, Rose.

26:56.990 --> 26:58.526
Why did you call me, dad?

26:58.700 --> 27:02.534
Why? I don't know you.
You don't know me.

27:05.916 --> 27:08.032
I mean, what did you think
asking me here?

27:08.127 --> 27:10.368
That I'd come every Sunday
and I'd bring Ben

27:10.462 --> 27:12.623
and he would sit
and color while we talked?

27:13.382 --> 27:18.627
You know, when I was about 20, I had
a list of things I wanted to say to you.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.338
Those days are gone.

27:23.433 --> 27:26.800
The visitation session is over.
Please conclude your visits.

27:27.062 --> 27:30.145
- It isn't enough time.
- Let's go, folks. Let's go.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.560
I'm sorry you're in this place.

27:32.693 --> 27:34.354
- I love you.
- Come on.

27:35.195 --> 27:36.651
And I wish you the best.

27:39.324 --> 27:40.564
I wish you the best.

27:43.704 --> 27:45.990
You figured out what to say after all.

27:48.083 --> 27:50.699
- I guess I did.
- Be all right if I wrote?

27:52.588 --> 27:55.250
There's some things
I'd like to tell you.

27:58.594 --> 28:02.052
- Tell Miguel I said hi.
- Yeah, we will.

28:04.725 --> 28:06.761
When I was in first grade,
I got straight "as."

28:12.107 --> 28:13.768
Come on. Let's go.

28:15.027 --> 28:18.440
- Afternoon, sir.
- Don't call me that. I'm not...

28:18.906 --> 28:20.237
Put your hand down.

28:33.670 --> 28:35.661
Permission to speak, sir. “What?

28:36.882 --> 28:38.543
I just wanted to say,

28:38.634 --> 28:40.090
welcome to the castle, sir.

28:40.177 --> 28:42.042
It's good to have you aboard, sir.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.170
Aboard? You Navy puke, son?

28:46.308 --> 28:49.220
No, no, sir. I was in the corps.

28:49.937 --> 28:52.019
What rank were you when you were arrested?

28:52.147 --> 28:54.729
- I was a...
- Either colonel or corporal.

28:54.816 --> 28:57.432
- I'm guessing corporal.
- Yes, sir.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.522
Why are you here?
What did you do?

29:01.865 --> 29:06.154
Well, that's just it.
I didn't do nothing.

29:06.745 --> 29:08.030
It was a mistake.

29:10.749 --> 29:11.749
Okay.

29:11.917 --> 29:13.828
Medication call is in five minutes.

29:14.419 --> 29:18.503
I hurt someone real bad.

29:22.636 --> 29:23.876
How long you been here?

29:24.513 --> 29:26.629
- Two years.
- And how long do you have?

29:26.807 --> 29:28.468
- How much longer?
- Four years,

29:28.809 --> 29:30.595
eight months, eleven days.

29:30.769 --> 29:34.387
And this mistake,
you've just the one?

29:36.191 --> 29:37.191
Just one.

29:38.610 --> 29:39.895
Just one day in your life”?

29:41.530 --> 29:45.614
- No.
- Take your time. Got plenty of that.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.825
Just five seconds, sir.

29:49.705 --> 29:51.787
You're a marine for what,
one or two years?

29:51.873 --> 29:53.829
And a violent criminal for five seconds?

29:54.543 --> 29:57.000
- Yes, sir.
- Well, according to my calculations,

29:57.671 --> 30:02.586
that makes you mostly marine.
About 98 percent, I'd say.

30:04.970 --> 30:08.178
- Yes, sir.
- Then why not act like one? Stand tall.

30:08.348 --> 30:11.590
The thing you do with your hand,
grabbing your hair, what's that?

30:13.061 --> 30:14.267
That was a salute.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.515
A sa... oh, no. I don't think so.

30:17.107 --> 30:19.564
- You know where saluting comes from?
- No, sir.

30:19.735 --> 30:21.521
It comes from medieval times.

30:22.404 --> 30:24.565
Two knights would approach
each other on horseback.

30:25.490 --> 30:28.402
They would raise their visors
and show their faces.

30:29.036 --> 30:31.118
Like they're saying,
"this is who I am.

30:31.580 --> 30:33.536
I'm not the enemy
and I'm not afraid."

30:34.374 --> 30:36.285
A salute's about respect, son.

30:36.752 --> 30:39.619
Respect for yourself,
the service and the flag.

30:39.755 --> 30:41.120
If you're going to do this...

30:41.214 --> 30:44.001
Sir, you wanted to see me? Sir?

30:45.218 --> 30:46.218
Come.

30:48.889 --> 30:49.889
Look at that.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.425
- Oh, man.
- No, no, no.

30:59.316 --> 31:04.982
At the war college, his very name
was spoken with a reverence.

31:05.864 --> 31:11.530
As if the syllables themselves conveyed
what it meant to be a soldier.

31:14.664 --> 31:15.744
Now here he is...

31:16.833 --> 31:21.202
Commanding an army of one,
the stuttering monkey.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.665
I can't even watch.

31:32.432 --> 31:35.469
I discussed the regulations
on saluting with aguilar, did I not?

31:35.852 --> 31:39.970
- Yes, sir.
- Remind him again, effectively.

32:42.586 --> 32:43.792
Come on, man, let's go.

33:05.442 --> 33:06.557
On the way, sir.

33:14.075 --> 33:15.440
Put your hand down.

33:16.495 --> 33:17.575
Put it down.

33:19.789 --> 33:22.872
- You don't have to do this.
- Prisoner irwin, what are you doing?

33:22.959 --> 33:25.666
- He doesn't have to do this.
- Just step back from the...

33:25.795 --> 33:29.583
- I know how to discipline a soldier.
- Prisoner aguilar, resume your punishment.

33:29.674 --> 33:31.790
- Punishment is over.
- I'm warning you...

33:33.512 --> 33:34.922
Stand down, prisoner!

33:35.764 --> 33:37.004
You're better than this.

33:42.187 --> 33:43.552
Okay, okay. That's enough.

33:46.233 --> 33:49.396
All inmates remain on the ground
in the prone position.

33:50.445 --> 33:54.233
All inmates remain on the ground
in the prone position.

33:57.202 --> 33:58.362
Stay down!

33:58.453 --> 33:59.989
Everybody stay down!

34:00.330 --> 34:01.615
What is happening here?

34:02.707 --> 34:06.120
This prisoner was interfering with the
corporal punishment of prisoner aguilar.

34:10.715 --> 34:13.797
Prisoner irwin,
I understand your coming here

34:13.885 --> 34:15.591
must be a big adjustment for you.

34:16.096 --> 34:19.884
To go from commanding
thousands of troops in battle,

34:20.391 --> 34:23.804
to having no war to fight and
no one following you must not be easy.

34:24.145 --> 34:28.353
However, I do ask that you learn
how things are done around here,

34:28.650 --> 34:31.141
and try to set an example
for the other men.

34:34.406 --> 34:37.944
Saluting is prohibited.
Aguilar was saluting.

34:38.118 --> 34:41.110
He is being disciplined.
Surely you understand that.

34:44.873 --> 34:46.830
Captain, take the prisoner
back to his cell.

34:46.918 --> 34:47.918
Yes, sir.

34:48.837 --> 34:49.837
Sir?

34:51.255 --> 34:52.712
May the prisoner speak, sir?

34:55.260 --> 34:56.260
Yes.

34:56.428 --> 35:01.388
According to the manual of conduct,
the corporal punishment for a prisoner

35:01.558 --> 35:05.972
begun on the day shift cannot exceed
the following morning's horn.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.064
Prisoner irwin,
you are absolutely right.

35:12.152 --> 35:15.110
Thank you for bringing that
to my attention.

35:16.781 --> 35:19.693
- Captain. Captain.
- Yes, sir.

35:34.215 --> 35:36.957
Prisoner irwin,
under no circumstances

35:37.052 --> 35:40.010
is an inmate allowed
to make physical contact with an officer.

35:40.847 --> 35:43.805
You have violated
the U.S. m.C.F. Manual of conduct

35:45.769 --> 35:47.760
and this violation requires discipline.

36:00.283 --> 36:01.283
What's going on?

36:01.576 --> 36:05.194
- Winter's got him on rock-and-roll detail.
- Is he not going to make it?

36:05.997 --> 36:07.953
No way. Three-two against.

36:09.042 --> 36:12.079
Come on, you guys.
Those stones weigh 25 pounds apiece.

36:12.295 --> 36:15.662
It's gonna be 85 degrees by noon,
and we have 2,000 percent humidity.

36:15.757 --> 36:17.372
He's not going to make the day.

36:18.134 --> 36:20.591
- Everyone paid up this week?
- Yeah, we're good.

36:20.720 --> 36:23.632
Put mine in, double or nothing against.
No way he's gonna make it.

36:23.723 --> 36:26.965
Beaupre, 12.
Double or nothing, against.

36:27.394 --> 36:28.975
Hey, hey, hey.

36:34.818 --> 36:36.308
Who's down for ten?

36:36.444 --> 36:38.275
For what? In favor or what?

36:43.410 --> 36:45.071
At least take some water.

36:45.495 --> 36:47.360
If you're dehydrated,
you're gonna drop.

36:48.415 --> 36:49.575
You sticking around?

36:50.625 --> 36:53.537
- Can he take it off, boss?
- Captain?

37:03.471 --> 37:05.382
Take off your shirt if you want.

37:16.025 --> 37:17.390
What the fuck is that?

37:17.652 --> 37:19.483
Electrical burn scars.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.690
How long was he in there?

37:21.781 --> 37:23.772
Six years.
Could've got out in four.

37:24.033 --> 37:26.240
They offered him a release, but he stayed.

37:26.327 --> 37:28.283
He said he wouldn't leave
without his men.

37:30.457 --> 37:32.664
Come on, baby! Drop that rock!

37:46.473 --> 37:48.179
Come on, general. You can do it.

37:49.058 --> 37:50.343
Come on, baby!

37:51.728 --> 37:52.968
Push that rock, soldier!

37:57.150 --> 37:59.983
Kind of tired, sir.
Why don't you call it quits?

38:00.445 --> 38:03.232
Don't listen to him, sir.
It's not that hot.

38:03.907 --> 38:05.568
Why don't you call it quits, sir?

38:12.874 --> 38:14.739
Go, general! Come on, baby!

38:19.047 --> 38:22.255
Come on. One more rock!
You got it, sir!

39:04.425 --> 39:07.383
It's over. Somebody pushed me.
That's it. He's down.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.506
He can't go on like that. Stay down.

39:09.597 --> 39:10.757
Look at me.

39:12.892 --> 39:15.975
- Follow it.
- It's all done. All over.

39:16.271 --> 39:18.683
It's all over.
Yates, 36 packs you owe me.

39:18.773 --> 39:21.856
- How many?
- Four.

39:21.985 --> 39:25.603
- What day is it?
- Saturday.

39:27.574 --> 39:28.859
He's fine.

39:28.950 --> 39:30.531
Yeah!

39:45.300 --> 39:47.040
Go! Go! Go!

40:02.191 --> 40:03.397
Way to go, man!

40:12.410 --> 40:13.410
Yes, sir.

40:23.004 --> 40:25.120
The discipline order
was horn-to-horn labor.

40:26.007 --> 40:28.248
You keep going,
no matter where the stones are.

40:28.343 --> 40:31.506
What's he supposed to do, captain?
He just moved the whole pile.

40:31.596 --> 40:32.927
He can move 'em back.

40:36.976 --> 40:38.091
Bets are still on.

40:38.186 --> 40:40.723
- Seven-two, against.
- You're a fuckin' snake, man.

40:40.813 --> 40:43.771
- Don't bet if you don't wanna.
- Yates, four in favor.

40:43.900 --> 40:45.231
Four in favor, aguilar.

40:45.318 --> 40:46.558
Four in favor!

40:47.695 --> 40:49.151
Who's down for ten?

40:52.992 --> 40:55.358
The horn. They're holding the horn.

40:56.245 --> 40:58.281
Winter's holding the horn.
It's not right.

40:59.540 --> 41:00.905
Son of a bitch.

41:17.433 --> 41:20.721
Everybody to the tiers for count!
Let's go! Move it!

41:20.853 --> 41:24.220
Inmates will move fo fiers
for face-to-badge count.

41:24.524 --> 41:28.142
Inmates will report to the tiers
for face-to-badge count.

41:33.199 --> 41:35.906
Why would you kill yourself
to help him with his wall?

41:39.455 --> 41:42.492
It's not his wall. It's your wall.

41:43.209 --> 41:45.325
Prisoner irwin, let's go.

41:51.551 --> 41:53.041
The commandant would like to see you.

42:04.355 --> 42:06.687
- They clean you up okay?
- Yes.

42:07.734 --> 42:10.396
The cut above your eye,
it's not too serious I hope.

42:10.653 --> 42:11.653
I'm okay.

42:16.159 --> 42:17.649
Well, I am sorry about this.

42:17.744 --> 42:20.781
It's the standard cooling-off period
after a punishment detail.

42:25.710 --> 42:29.043
I hope you understand...
I did this for the men.

42:29.464 --> 42:31.796
- The men?
- Yes, to show them.

42:33.009 --> 42:36.126
To show them that you are
no different than they are.

42:38.681 --> 42:43.175
Your new friend, aguilar, he took
a claw hammer to his platoon leader.

42:43.269 --> 42:47.512
He maimed him in a quote,
unquote fit of rage.

42:49.275 --> 42:53.018
Whenever I am... filled with doubt,

42:53.112 --> 42:55.854
whenever sentiment creeps in...

42:56.991 --> 43:00.825
I just have to open an inmate's file
and see what he's done.

43:00.912 --> 43:03.824
I see what he's capable of.
I see the worst of him.

43:05.958 --> 43:07.744
And that makes my job easier.

43:09.754 --> 43:11.665
It crystallizes my mission.

43:20.723 --> 43:23.009
- Take him back to the tiers.
- Yes, sir.

43:28.147 --> 43:29.147
Hold on.

43:48.626 --> 43:51.493
Sergeant, taking him back to cell 345.

43:51.587 --> 43:52.667
Very well, private.

44:41.804 --> 44:44.090
General!

44:44.390 --> 44:45.675
Good night, guys.

44:48.728 --> 44:51.720
- Your winnings.
- My winnings?

44:52.523 --> 44:54.479
Aguilar placed a bet for you.

44:54.859 --> 44:56.520
Four bundles at seven-to-two,

44:56.611 --> 44:59.227
two bundles at eleven-to-one.
That's 36 bundles.

44:59.780 --> 45:01.111
You could be thrown out

45:01.199 --> 45:03.064
of the hall of fame
for betting on yourself.

45:05.453 --> 45:06.738
Corporal aguilar.

45:09.415 --> 45:12.122
Would you pass these out
to the men? I don't smoke.

45:14.962 --> 45:16.077
Thank you, sir.

45:23.179 --> 45:24.339
So you're the gambler.

45:24.430 --> 45:26.921
Nah, I don't gamble.
I'm just the bookkeeper.

45:27.183 --> 45:30.425
Yeah? I hear you're running
a suicide pool on me.

45:30.978 --> 45:32.013
That's right.

45:32.104 --> 45:33.389
Any squares left?

45:34.899 --> 45:37.015
Yeah, there's one. Nine weeks.

45:39.362 --> 45:41.318
- How much to enter?
- No way, man.

45:41.614 --> 45:43.730
You'd off yourself just to win the bet.

45:43.950 --> 45:47.408
Not me.
I bet on myself, it's to win.

45:47.495 --> 45:49.076
Yeah, you don't always win.

45:50.831 --> 45:51.831
No.

45:53.167 --> 45:54.167
Clearly not.

45:57.546 --> 46:00.037
My father said
you kept him alive in Hanoi.

46:01.008 --> 46:02.714
That you kept all those guys alive.

46:03.511 --> 46:04.511
Nah.

46:07.974 --> 46:09.701
When you're tortured,
the first thing they do

46:09.725 --> 46:12.933
is try to break down your sense of self.
And I broke in Hanoi.

46:13.813 --> 46:16.680
For weeks, the last thing in
my mind was self-preservation.

46:17.984 --> 46:21.977
In fact, I prayed for death, every night.

46:22.989 --> 46:25.776
The only thing that kept me
from answering those prayers

46:26.075 --> 46:29.408
were the men's voices in the other rooms,
your father among them.

46:31.706 --> 46:34.664
I don't care what you've heard,
yates. They kept me alive.

46:35.167 --> 46:36.703
Not the other way around.

46:39.297 --> 46:41.288
Hey! Sir?

46:42.675 --> 46:44.381
You cost me my stash of smokes.

46:45.261 --> 46:46.546
Well, I'm sorry about that.

46:47.638 --> 46:49.378
Well, you win some, you lose some.

46:52.101 --> 46:54.262
What did you mean about it being our wall?

46:54.353 --> 46:56.093
It's winter's wall.

46:56.230 --> 46:58.642
He just makes us
work it to keep us occupied.

46:58.733 --> 47:01.065
It's like we're a bunch
of kids or something.

47:01.569 --> 47:03.776
In 1870, there was nothing here.

47:04.739 --> 47:07.731
The original prison
was built by prisoners. I want to show...

47:08.951 --> 47:11.283
Show you something I found the other day.

47:11.662 --> 47:12.662
Where?

47:14.040 --> 47:15.280
Here it is.

47:16.959 --> 47:17.994
You see this?

47:19.587 --> 47:24.957
"Private a.J. Beck, 1912-1923."

47:27.678 --> 47:29.543
Now why do you suppose
private Beck...

47:30.765 --> 47:33.256
What do you think he was doing,
building his own prison?

47:34.352 --> 47:35.592
How the fuck do I know?

47:35.686 --> 47:38.428
Well, I don't know either,
but I can make a guess.

47:39.315 --> 47:41.772
My guess is he wasn't building a prison.

47:44.070 --> 47:46.561
My guess is he was building
something else.

47:46.906 --> 47:50.273
They may have told him to build a prison,
but, in his own mind,

47:51.118 --> 47:53.154
he was raising walls
to protect himself.

47:55.998 --> 47:57.909
My guess is he was building a castle.

47:59.335 --> 48:00.495
That's a castle?

48:01.837 --> 48:03.373
Yeah, it could be.

48:05.508 --> 48:07.214
Could be.
If somebody rebuilt it.

48:07.301 --> 48:10.384
- How we supposed to do that, sir?
- How you supposed to do that?

48:10.721 --> 48:12.882
I don't know anything about walls.

48:13.599 --> 48:16.056
Why don't you ask...
Ask aguilar.

49:08.362 --> 49:09.362
Niebolt!

49:17.538 --> 49:20.280
- Good morning, sir.
- What happened here?

49:21.250 --> 49:23.081
The prisoners knocked it down, sir.

49:23.252 --> 49:25.743
- Why?
- Irwin, he told them to.

49:28.757 --> 49:29.757
Thank you.

49:47.985 --> 49:49.600
Beaupre?

49:53.282 --> 49:54.488
What's up, aguilar?

49:57.828 --> 49:59.568
That's not the right rock.

50:01.499 --> 50:03.865
Cutbush, you believe this kid?

50:03.959 --> 50:06.416
Yeah, he seems
to know his shit, you know?

50:07.296 --> 50:08.832
All right, aguilar. I'll bite.

50:09.882 --> 50:13.340
- Bring me the right rock.
- Okay.

50:15.429 --> 50:18.796
You need a rock with a flat edge,

50:19.141 --> 50:22.224
because that one's jagged.

50:22.561 --> 50:24.392
The jagged ones go in the middle.

50:24.605 --> 50:26.561
The middle? All right.

50:29.276 --> 50:30.766
Bring me another one.

50:31.111 --> 50:34.194
If I keep getting you the flat rocks,
you'll never learn...

50:34.281 --> 50:36.567
I'll get you one more, okay, beaupre?

50:38.494 --> 50:40.826
Mr. aguilar? It looks good.

50:41.539 --> 50:42.870
Thanks, chief.

50:47.836 --> 50:48.916
Morning, chief.

51:27.251 --> 51:30.459
I'm impressed.
Pretty handy with a trowel.

51:32.715 --> 51:34.421
- Good work.
- You know it, chief.

51:35.426 --> 51:37.007
- Nice work.
- Thanks, chief.

51:40.472 --> 51:43.930
- What do you think?
- I think she's beautiful.

51:44.977 --> 51:48.014
- That's the word.
- 18 courses in one week.

51:48.981 --> 51:49.981
Aguilar...

51:51.900 --> 51:53.936
I'm proud of you.
You should be proud.

51:58.157 --> 52:01.320
- Men did good, huh?
- They did.

52:02.536 --> 52:05.903
Now, listen. Be sure to leave a window,
a portal. Every castle has one.

52:05.998 --> 52:09.866
Aguilar? Excuse me, chief.
Aguilar, come here a minute.

52:10.544 --> 52:14.662
- Go ahead.
- Guys, hold up a minute.

52:14.757 --> 52:15.963
Hold up the work.

52:18.052 --> 52:19.052
Hold up.

52:21.138 --> 52:22.719
Maybe you should go first.

52:26.727 --> 52:29.935
Put your name in the wall.
Hey, hold up on the work.

52:30.981 --> 52:32.937
Come on. Put your name
right in here.

52:34.610 --> 52:39.320
Spell it out. A-g.

52:40.282 --> 52:42.022
Scumbags are having at it, sir.

52:42.117 --> 52:44.108
- Really?
- Yes, sir.

52:44.328 --> 52:47.661
They're calling irwin "chief."
That's the word they got for general.

52:48.415 --> 52:50.781
They got substitute names
for the other ranks too, sir.

52:50.959 --> 52:52.790
Anybody who was a captain is "boss."

52:52.878 --> 52:55.540
Sergeants are "sport."
Privates are "pal."

52:56.340 --> 52:57.455
Playing soldier, sir.

52:59.718 --> 53:02.585
- Hearts and minds.
- Sir?

53:03.013 --> 53:04.719
He's building
a structure of loyalty.

53:04.807 --> 53:09.517
He's offering them self-respect,
in exchange for obedience.

53:11.855 --> 53:14.062
The general is building himself an army.

53:14.400 --> 53:17.813
He can have their hearts and minds,
but we got 'em by the balls.

53:17.986 --> 53:20.068
- Well put, corporal.
- Thank you, sir.

53:20.322 --> 53:21.322
Captain.

53:27.871 --> 53:29.987
- Bring him to my office.
- Who, sir?

53:30.082 --> 53:32.118
The prince of Venezuela.
Who do you think?

53:32.209 --> 53:34.450
- General irwin?
- Mr. irwin.

53:36.213 --> 53:37.544
When you first arrived here,

53:37.631 --> 53:40.293
I asked you a question.
Apparently, I need to ask again.

53:41.343 --> 53:44.050
What do you want from your time
here at the castle?

53:44.513 --> 53:46.799
My answer is the same as it was then.

53:46.974 --> 53:48.589
Do my time. Go home.

53:48.684 --> 53:51.892
So you say, but everything
you have done has contradicted that.

53:55.774 --> 53:58.766
These men are not here
for unpaid parking fines and traffic...

53:58.861 --> 54:01.147
I'm under no illusion
why the men are here.

54:01.572 --> 54:03.278
I just think they might be reminded

54:03.532 --> 54:06.239
about some good things they've done,
not only the worst.

54:06.368 --> 54:08.984
Yes, that is... something
my predecessor used to say.

54:09.496 --> 54:12.158
In his last two years here
there were seven escape attempts,

54:12.291 --> 54:15.909
12 injury assaults on officers
and n.C.O.S, including one killed.

54:16.587 --> 54:19.124
Since I took command,
there have been zero escape attempts,

54:19.214 --> 54:21.705
zero injury assaults, zero fatalities.

54:21.800 --> 54:25.042
Some may question my methods,
but they do work.

54:25.679 --> 54:29.297
No soldier has ever died needlessly
under my command, Mr. irwin.

54:30.350 --> 54:32.682
See, I, too, share the burden of command.

54:32.770 --> 54:34.956
You may think that I've never
set foot on a battlefield,

54:34.980 --> 54:38.222
but that's because you've never sat
behind this desk... this desk.

54:39.193 --> 54:43.778
My men and I are vastly outnumbered.
We spend every day behind enemy lines.

54:43.989 --> 54:47.277
Because, make no mistake about it,
they are the enemy.

54:48.285 --> 54:51.277
But I don't need to justify
myself to you, do 1?

54:52.122 --> 54:53.122
I don't know.

54:53.499 --> 54:54.499
Do you?

54:59.129 --> 55:00.164
This wall,

55:01.757 --> 55:05.716
that has become the focus
of so much tension,

55:06.053 --> 55:07.293
and turmoil...

55:09.097 --> 55:10.097
Well,

55:10.849 --> 55:13.886
in about two minutes,
there will be no more wall.

55:40.796 --> 55:42.127
Back away from the wall...

55:43.423 --> 55:45.664
Back away!

55:46.593 --> 55:47.673
Come on!

55:48.804 --> 55:50.044
Back away from the wall.

55:54.351 --> 55:55.557
Come on!

55:57.145 --> 55:59.511
Aguilar! Aguilar, damn it!

55:59.815 --> 56:01.021
What is he doing?

56:08.282 --> 56:09.442
Sound the horn.

56:17.291 --> 56:18.906
Agui... get down!

56:19.209 --> 56:20.449
All inmates remain...

56:20.544 --> 56:22.205
Aguilar, get down!

56:23.005 --> 56:25.212
What the hell are you doing?
Get down, aguilar.

56:25.841 --> 56:27.706
- No!
- Get down!

56:29.970 --> 56:32.461
Hey, what are you doing, Ramon?
Get down!

56:32.556 --> 56:34.763
- Aguilar, get down!
- Get down!

56:35.726 --> 56:37.262
Aguilar, get the hell down!

56:37.352 --> 56:39.468
- Zamorro.
- Yes, sir.

56:42.399 --> 56:45.766
- You bet, sir.
- What the hell are you doing?

56:45.861 --> 56:47.567
- Get down!
- Get down!

56:47.654 --> 56:50.441
- Aguilar, get down!
- Get down!

56:57.915 --> 56:59.030
Aguilar?

56:59.124 --> 57:00.989
Permission to examine the prisoner, sir.

57:01.084 --> 57:03.325
- Doc! Come on!
- Sir?

58:08.610 --> 58:10.225
- Dellwo.
- Sir?

58:12.739 --> 58:16.072
- You're a sergeant-major?
- I was.

58:16.910 --> 58:19.777
Prisoners! Fall in!

58:23.125 --> 58:26.037
I said, fall in!

58:26.211 --> 58:28.953
Let's go, ladies! Now! Now! Now!

58:30.799 --> 58:33.040
All right! Let's fall in!

58:34.428 --> 58:36.669
Fall in! We don't got all day!

58:36.763 --> 58:38.628
Come on. Fall in!

58:40.225 --> 58:42.341
You look like a bunch of old women!

58:42.436 --> 58:43.801
Fall in, goddamn it!

58:44.521 --> 58:47.103
Fall in! Now! Now!

58:47.190 --> 58:48.190
Now!

58:51.945 --> 58:55.437
- Scumbags runnin' the asylum?
- Maybe.

59:16.511 --> 59:18.672
Some may think to be
remembered in this way...

59:19.514 --> 59:21.505
Would be a disgrace to a soldier.

59:24.061 --> 59:25.676
But this is not a disgrace.

59:27.856 --> 59:30.438
The greatest monuments to fallen men

59:31.568 --> 59:32.774
are not made in marble.

59:35.781 --> 59:38.067
They're deep in the sea,
deep in the jungles,

59:38.366 --> 59:40.027
on foreign battlefields,

59:40.660 --> 59:42.150
a rifle driven into the ground,

59:42.245 --> 59:45.988
with a helmet on top,
and some tags.

59:49.294 --> 59:51.751
And that is the tribute
that this man has earned.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:11.889
Gentlemen, corporal Ramon aguilar,

01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:14.940
United States marine corps.

01:00:58.405 --> 01:00:59.645
Sir, do you...

01:01:17.799 --> 01:01:19.414
Sound the chow horn.

01:01:21.970 --> 01:01:24.382
- Sir, you still have about ten minutes.
- Sound it.

01:01:26.016 --> 01:01:27.016
Yes, sir.

01:01:33.732 --> 01:01:34.938
Present

01:01:35.525 --> 01:01:36.560
arms!

01:02:00.008 --> 01:02:01.873
Fall out!

01:02:08.892 --> 01:02:14.804
Chow call.
All inmates report to the mess hall.

01:02:20.445 --> 01:02:23.812
So, tell me again.
Why is it aguilar had to die?

01:02:39.631 --> 01:02:42.293
- Believe us now?
- I believe you now.

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:44.249
Very good.

01:02:45.387 --> 01:02:47.378
You have checkmate
in five moves.

01:02:49.099 --> 01:02:50.305
Looks that way, sir.

01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:55.351
Why you movin' if I have
checkmate in five moves?

01:02:56.481 --> 01:02:58.096
'Cause I have checkmate in three.

01:02:59.526 --> 01:03:01.733
Shall we... call it a draw?

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:06.278
If you'll excuse us, Mr...

01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:08.652
Enriquez. Let's go. Move it out.

01:03:35.770 --> 01:03:36.850
Your...

01:03:38.148 --> 01:03:39.148
Grandson.

01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:40.899
Yes.

01:03:42.193 --> 01:03:43.399
Very cute.

01:03:45.196 --> 01:03:48.279
- Five?
- Four, when that picture was taken.

01:03:48.908 --> 01:03:50.023
Six now.

01:03:55.290 --> 01:03:57.781
It was unfortunate about...

01:03:59.127 --> 01:04:00.162
Aguilar.

01:04:01.338 --> 01:04:04.375
But tough decisions
do go with the job.

01:04:05.759 --> 01:04:07.545
Burden of command, correct?

01:04:12.807 --> 01:04:14.047
Look...

01:04:16.019 --> 01:04:18.886
These salutes,
I've given them some thought.

01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:23.186
Technically, they are not
a violation of regulations.

01:04:25.111 --> 01:04:30.231
So, if the inmates can confine
themselves to a simple

01:04:31.076 --> 01:04:32.862
hand movement through the hair,

01:04:35.330 --> 01:04:36.911
I see no problem with it.

01:04:39.834 --> 01:04:42.951
And if the men want
to call you chief, well, that's fine.

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:45.166
Free speech and all that.

01:04:53.014 --> 01:04:56.882
- Okay, then.
- No, not okay.

01:04:58.061 --> 01:04:59.346
It's too late, colonel.

01:05:00.605 --> 01:05:02.516
- It's too late for what?
- For your offer.

01:05:03.149 --> 01:05:04.639
The men don't want to salute.

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:07.225
They don't want to use rank.

01:05:07.529 --> 01:05:09.770
They don't want better food or more TV.

01:05:09.864 --> 01:05:12.071
They just want your resignation. So do I.

01:05:14.369 --> 01:05:16.485
- My resignation?
- You're a disgrace, colonel.

01:05:16.913 --> 01:05:18.528
A disgrace to the uniform.

01:05:19.541 --> 01:05:21.827
You shouldn't be allowed
to retain your command.

01:05:26.381 --> 01:05:27.837
Well, then I'd better go pack.

01:05:29.342 --> 01:05:30.798
I think you should.

01:05:34.806 --> 01:05:37.673
Tell me, Mr. irwin,
what's to stop me from just

01:05:37.976 --> 01:05:41.389
placing you in the hole
for, say, six months?

01:05:41.855 --> 01:05:42.855
Nothing.

01:05:44.816 --> 01:05:46.352
If that's how you want to win.

01:05:52.157 --> 01:05:53.943
Sir, if I can make a suggestion,

01:05:54.033 --> 01:05:57.275
- maybe we should isolate prisoner lrwin...
- Get me general Wheeler.

01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:01.331
Yes, sir.

01:06:07.213 --> 01:06:11.627
Two weeks ago, I watched as he marched
a man up and down the yard.

01:06:12.719 --> 01:06:14.960
A minor eccentricity. Fine.

01:06:15.221 --> 01:06:17.928
Since then, he's been acting as though

01:06:18.016 --> 01:06:21.975
he still has a command
in some fantasy army.

01:06:22.061 --> 01:06:23.176
And yesterday...

01:06:23.271 --> 01:06:24.911
I don't think you'd want to make general.

01:06:24.939 --> 01:06:27.305
You wouldn't want to give up
all these perks, would you?

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:31.980
Sorry. Go on.

01:06:33.031 --> 01:06:37.991
Yesterday, Mr. irwin told me
he required my resignation.

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:41.869
Frankly, I think
he's started to lose the plot.

01:06:42.207 --> 01:06:43.538
You saying he's delusional?

01:06:45.627 --> 01:06:48.164
I'm saying he needs
professional psychiatric help.

01:06:48.254 --> 01:06:50.586
He's sick and becoming pathetic.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:54.003
You might want to be a little more
careful in your word choice.

01:06:54.093 --> 01:06:56.584
That sick, pathetic man
put this star on my shoulder.

01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.420
Yes, sir. I know.

01:06:59.599 --> 01:07:03.558
And I also know
that you sat in on his court-martial.

01:07:03.645 --> 01:07:07.604
And don't talk about things
that are above your pay grade.

01:07:09.275 --> 01:07:10.310
Yes, sir.

01:07:16.407 --> 01:07:19.240
General Wheeler, I admire
the man as much as you do.

01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:22.026
I want to see
that he gets the best care possible.

01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:24.783
I'm not sure
that this is the right place for that.

01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.286
All right. Well, let me see him.

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:50.889
Do we read the rules, sir?

01:07:51.943 --> 01:07:52.943
Read 'em.

01:07:53.736 --> 01:07:56.694
Well, sir, normally for a contact visit,

01:07:56.781 --> 01:07:59.523
folks are limited to one embrace
in the beginning and one at the end.

01:08:00.201 --> 01:08:02.863
And hands must be visible
at all times, also.

01:08:03.454 --> 01:08:05.194
I guess that rules out the hand-job.

01:08:09.794 --> 01:08:11.000
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:17.252
- Permission to be seated, sir.
- Permission granted.

01:08:33.192 --> 01:08:34.682
Why are you doing here, Jim?

01:08:34.861 --> 01:08:36.725
I'm here to see if you've lost your mind.

01:08:37.988 --> 01:08:39.399
He should be available laler.

01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:41.738
- I can take a... hold on.
- Good morning.

01:08:41.826 --> 01:08:44.238
- Jim... Jim, yeah... hold on...
- Miss Kelly?

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:45.660
I got everything here but

01:08:45.747 --> 01:08:47.487
- the athletic gear.
- I found that

01:08:47.582 --> 01:08:50.368
top one laying on the floor
out in the hallway.

01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:52.621
- Hold on. What, Danny?
- I found that top one

01:08:52.712 --> 01:08:55.064
- laying on the floor in the hallway.
- Fine. Thanks, Danny.

01:08:55.089 --> 01:08:58.296
We just needed you to send him
up here as soon as possible.

01:09:01.261 --> 01:09:02.627
He's says you're delusional,

01:09:02.846 --> 01:09:05.554
that you're acting as if you're still
in command of an army.

01:09:06.434 --> 01:09:09.095
He's saying I'm delusional
because he wants me gone.

01:09:32.210 --> 01:09:33.791
Now, if you had ironclad evidence

01:09:33.961 --> 01:09:36.747
of winter killing a man
in cold-blood for no good reason,

01:09:36.839 --> 01:09:38.545
then I could do something, maybe.

01:09:39.466 --> 01:09:42.334
Outside of that,
the man's been investigated three times.

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:44.464
He's been exonerated three times.

01:09:44.971 --> 01:09:48.805
And as far as Washington is concerned,
he's doing a superb job.

01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:51.679
And you're a convicted criminal.

01:09:55.942 --> 01:09:58.354
- You could get another investigation.
- I could.

01:09:58.444 --> 01:10:00.856
But without new evidence,
what would be the point?

01:10:01.489 --> 01:10:05.607
And besides that, gene, honestly,
I don't give a rat's ass.

01:10:06.369 --> 01:10:10.578
I don't care. What I care about
is you and getting you out.

01:10:10.665 --> 01:10:12.781
Now, haven't you punished yourself enough?

01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:15.207
What I did was wrong, Jim.

01:10:15.294 --> 01:10:16.409
All teams.

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:19.454
All teams, this is a full s.O.R.T. Alert.

01:10:19.549 --> 01:10:23.212
Repeat: All teams,
this is a full s.O.R.T. Alert.

01:10:23.428 --> 01:10:24.428
Gol

01:10:34.313 --> 01:10:36.520
I cannot let this continue.

01:10:36.941 --> 01:10:39.478
You will get out of here,
and spend some time

01:10:39.569 --> 01:10:41.434
with your daughter
and your grandson.

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:45.021
My staff can run a compassionate
release on medical grounds.

01:10:45.116 --> 01:10:46.276
You can say whatever...

01:10:46.367 --> 01:10:49.905
- There's nothing wrong with me.
- For Christ's sake, will you work with me?

01:10:49.996 --> 01:10:51.486
There is nothing wrong with me.

01:10:51.581 --> 01:10:54.573
I see no indication of anything, sir.

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:58.664
Of course not. He'll keep it hidden
until the last possible second.

01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:05.000
Red team, go.

01:11:05.094 --> 01:11:06.300
Go, go, go!

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:08.761
Gene, what the hell is this about?

01:11:09.557 --> 01:11:10.592
Is this about control?

01:11:11.184 --> 01:11:13.425
Because you know no castle
can have two kings.

01:11:16.731 --> 01:11:18.062
Get on the floor, now!

01:11:19.150 --> 01:11:20.640
- Come with us.
- What are you doing?

01:11:22.904 --> 01:11:26.021
All inmates remain
on the ground in the prone position.

01:11:26.365 --> 01:11:28.526
All inmates remain on the ground...

01:11:28.743 --> 01:11:30.279
Let's go! What is this!

01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:31.984
What is this for Christ's sake?

01:11:32.079 --> 01:11:34.320
Go! Let's go! Go, go, go, go!

01:11:44.467 --> 01:11:45.502
Go! Go! Go!

01:11:46.427 --> 01:11:49.544
All inmates remain
on the ground in the prone position.

01:11:53.017 --> 01:11:54.177
All right!

01:12:17.875 --> 01:12:20.287
Sir? Tear gas?

01:12:21.671 --> 01:12:24.458
Return to hangar.
Nothing is happening.

01:12:24.841 --> 01:12:26.206
It was a bluff.

01:12:26.300 --> 01:12:29.087
You can take her home.
Return to hangar.

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:34.050
You thought he was trying
to take me hostage?

01:12:34.141 --> 01:12:37.008
- It was a precautionary move, sir.
- What kind of grab-ass unit

01:12:37.103 --> 01:12:38.593
are you running here, colonel?

01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:43.348
Sir, at 11:58 this morning,
I received a letter

01:12:43.484 --> 01:12:47.727
stating a group of inmates were planning
to take you hostage at 12:10.

01:12:48.030 --> 01:12:50.942
I thought it prudent
to act immediately to ensure your safety.

01:12:51.033 --> 01:12:53.866
I heard some disturbing things
about what goes on in here.

01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:57.988
Now I'm hearing it from a man
who I trust, whose opinion I respect.

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:00.323
- May I speak freely, sir?
- Yes, you may.

01:13:00.418 --> 01:13:01.783
With all due respect,

01:13:01.961 --> 01:13:04.748
I don't know
what you may have been hearing.

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:07.663
But until you've spent some time
with those animals,

01:13:07.758 --> 01:13:10.249
you have no idea
what happens in there.

01:13:11.429 --> 01:13:12.760
Point taken, colonel.

01:13:13.431 --> 01:13:18.300
Nevertheless, if I hear one more story
about a man dying under your command,

01:13:18.394 --> 01:13:20.680
you are through here.
Do you understand me?

01:13:21.939 --> 01:13:22.974
Yes, sir.

01:13:25.484 --> 01:13:26.564
All right.

01:13:28.571 --> 01:13:32.029
As far as irwin is concerned,
my judgment is he is as sane as you or I.

01:13:32.116 --> 01:13:33.902
I wish he wasn't. He is.

01:13:34.869 --> 01:13:37.952
I'd like nothing more
than an excuse to get him out of here.

01:13:38.039 --> 01:13:41.827
But I see the only way
that'll happen is if you request it.

01:13:43.711 --> 01:13:45.042
That is true, sir.

01:13:45.713 --> 01:13:49.251
So you just... you tell me
you can't handle him. He's gone.

01:13:51.093 --> 01:13:53.254
I think I can handle him, sir.

01:13:55.306 --> 01:13:56.716
You watch yourself, colonel.

01:14:02.605 --> 01:14:05.187
"Eugene r. Irwin...

01:14:07.443 --> 01:14:10.105
Lieutenant general, United States army,

01:14:10.738 --> 01:14:13.024
in direct contravention
of an order to evacuate

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:15.197
Burundi by his commander-in-chief..."

01:14:16.369 --> 01:14:19.327
That is the president,
for those of you who do not know.

01:14:20.915 --> 01:14:22.780
"Selected a platoon
of men to extract

01:14:22.875 --> 01:14:25.207
Jackson ngwe, a local warlord.

01:14:25.878 --> 01:14:28.745
Disregarding reliable intelligence,

01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:32.965
general irwin's reconnaissance team
entered the ville at 0300.

01:14:33.052 --> 01:14:37.011
Eight men were captured
and executed."

01:14:37.807 --> 01:14:39.172
"Disregarding...

01:14:40.601 --> 01:14:42.307
Reliable intelligence..."

01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:47.309
"Eight men were executed."

01:14:52.405 --> 01:14:57.195
What I want you men to understand
is what the consequences can be,

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.652
when you choose to follow
a man who is motivated

01:15:01.747 --> 01:15:03.658
solely by his pride.

01:15:04.166 --> 01:15:09.456
A man who will do anything
for one more victory notch on his belt,

01:15:10.047 --> 01:15:11.457
no matter what the cost,

01:15:12.675 --> 01:15:14.506
before he fades away.

01:15:21.892 --> 01:15:23.098
Start the extractions.

01:15:23.310 --> 01:15:25.426
Go! Move it!

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:27.929
Go! Gol

01:15:31.819 --> 01:15:33.400
move it! Move it!

01:15:38.159 --> 01:15:39.899
- Come here!
- Get your hands off me.

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:42.158
Let's go. Get out! Get out!

01:15:42.246 --> 01:15:44.612
Hi, doc. Let's go for a little walk.

01:15:46.292 --> 01:15:47.498
Get the fuck back!

01:15:48.085 --> 01:15:50.371
- Open 355!
- Open it up!

01:15:54.008 --> 01:15:56.294
- Look at you.
- Relax, ladies.

01:15:57.136 --> 01:15:58.376
Hold him down, men!

01:15:59.430 --> 01:16:01.716
I had nothing to do with this! No!

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:15.643
- Why don't you just execute me?
- No reason for that!

01:16:15.780 --> 01:16:16.860
Turn him around.

01:16:20.659 --> 01:16:22.240
Don't put me in the hole!

01:16:22.703 --> 01:16:26.321
Don't... don't put me in the hole! No!

01:16:32.505 --> 01:16:34.086
- You want that?
- No.

01:16:34.590 --> 01:16:36.330
- Thanks, man.
- You bet.

01:17:32.606 --> 01:17:34.096
What do we do now?

01:17:36.819 --> 01:17:37.899
Jimmy, wait up!

01:17:37.987 --> 01:17:41.229
Altention, inmaftes.
All visitation requests must be submitted

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:43.735
lo the s-3 by 1100 today.

01:17:44.326 --> 01:17:45.611
All visitation requests...

01:17:45.703 --> 01:17:47.944
So, you really did,
you really did bluff winter.

01:17:49.707 --> 01:17:52.039
The problem is his flush
beat your straight.

01:17:53.210 --> 01:17:55.451
I don't play poker,
Mr. yates. I play chess.

01:17:55.963 --> 01:17:58.545
And in chess, you play
with somebody long enough,

01:17:59.175 --> 01:18:02.292
you realize that their first three moves
are usually the same.

01:18:02.386 --> 01:18:04.297
Chess, huh?
What was his first move?

01:18:04.597 --> 01:18:08.465
- What was the first move?
- First, two teams, 20 men apiece.

01:18:08.559 --> 01:18:11.517
Like I was saying,
the inside teams only have batons.

01:18:11.645 --> 01:18:12.725
Second?

01:18:12.813 --> 01:18:14.394
- Second? Water Cannon.
- Third?

01:18:14.481 --> 01:18:16.187
- Chopper.
- What kind of chopper?

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:19.608
Sir, should we be having
this discussion this man standing...

01:18:19.695 --> 01:18:21.151
You know we can't trust him.

01:18:23.782 --> 01:18:24.897
I don't know.

01:18:26.702 --> 01:18:28.488
Is that how you use
the burden of command?

01:18:29.205 --> 01:18:32.368
To make men into...
Into chess pieces?

01:18:34.293 --> 01:18:36.500
- Yes.
- Hey, yates.

01:18:37.129 --> 01:18:39.085
Do yourself a favor and run along.

01:18:41.967 --> 01:18:43.047
Pawns.

01:18:44.261 --> 01:18:46.252
That prisoner walking away, who is that?

01:18:46.764 --> 01:18:48.174
That's... that's yates.

01:18:48.599 --> 01:18:52.842
He was an apache pilot, but now he's a
lowlife... a hustler. He takes bets.

01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:55.260
- On what?
- Anything.

01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:57.183
Fights, the weather.

01:18:58.609 --> 01:19:01.100
He took bets on whether
irwin was gonna kill himself.

01:19:27.513 --> 01:19:29.378
"This highly effective officer

01:19:29.473 --> 01:19:32.556
seems to have
no moral grounding whatsoever."

01:19:34.561 --> 01:19:35.561
Is that so?

01:19:36.855 --> 01:19:39.267
That's what men better
than me seem to think, sir.

01:19:41.110 --> 01:19:42.725
Why are you here, yates?

01:19:43.779 --> 01:19:45.144
I would like your version.

01:19:47.116 --> 01:19:49.448
I was involved in
a drug-smuggling operation

01:19:49.535 --> 01:19:51.275
from juarez to El Paso

01:19:51.370 --> 01:19:53.406
including several
of my subordinates, sir.

01:19:54.373 --> 01:19:55.704
You were "involved."

01:19:56.500 --> 01:19:58.161
You ran it, did you not?

01:19:58.836 --> 01:19:59.836
Correct.

01:20:02.756 --> 01:20:06.340
Says here that you wore
a wire on your men.

01:20:07.261 --> 01:20:08.546
Is that correct?

01:20:09.388 --> 01:20:11.379
- Yeah.
- And how many years

01:20:11.473 --> 01:20:14.636
did they take off
your sentence for that?

01:20:14.727 --> 01:20:15.933
Four years, sir.

01:20:19.023 --> 01:20:20.433
Now you're the prison bookie.

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:26.602
Tell me, yates,
how does a man like you

01:20:27.614 --> 01:20:29.024
get into west point?

01:20:29.825 --> 01:20:32.737
My father was awarded
the congressional medal of honor, sir.

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:35.910
Right.

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:43.578
Well, sometimes
the apple does fall far from the tree.

01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:47.964
Your father...

01:20:49.345 --> 01:20:53.054
Your father was a pow
with Mr. irwin, was he not?

01:20:59.813 --> 01:21:00.893
Yes, that is correct.

01:21:00.981 --> 01:21:04.314
And yet, you haven't seen fit
to join Mr. irwin's...

01:21:04.401 --> 01:21:07.438
- Crusade?
- Crusade.

01:21:08.614 --> 01:21:10.946
- Why is that?
- It's not my fight.

01:21:11.241 --> 01:21:12.572
Mr. irwin's in a fight?

01:21:14.912 --> 01:21:17.278
It says here you have three years

01:21:18.040 --> 01:21:19.280
left with us.

01:21:19.583 --> 01:21:22.040
- Correct?
- That's what it says.

01:21:22.711 --> 01:21:24.451
That's what it says.

01:21:26.799 --> 01:21:28.289
Does three months sound better?

01:21:30.469 --> 01:21:34.212
I need to resolve this situation, quickly,

01:21:35.432 --> 01:21:38.344
before someone else gets hurt, or killed.

01:21:39.645 --> 01:21:40.760
Do you agree?

01:21:42.564 --> 01:21:45.271
- I guess.
- And I need to do that with information.

01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:50.023
So, you might want to rethink

01:21:50.114 --> 01:21:54.198
your joining Mr. irwin's crusade.

01:22:01.959 --> 01:22:03.870
You asking me to be your snitch, sir?

01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:07.253
Isn't it a little late in the game
to be self-righteous?

01:22:08.382 --> 01:22:12.125
- Dude, why I got to get my ass kicked?
- How many times you gonna ask?

01:22:12.594 --> 01:22:14.676
Stop sniveling.
I'm only gonna hit you once.

01:22:15.139 --> 01:22:16.925
- Well, when?
- Now!

01:22:17.808 --> 01:22:18.672
Shit!

01:22:18.767 --> 01:22:20.098
Fight! Fight!

01:22:24.106 --> 01:22:25.687
Sit your tray down!

01:22:27.818 --> 01:22:29.024
Hey, fucker!

01:22:32.990 --> 01:22:34.776
Please! I am cooperating.

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:42.288
Back off now!
I said back off now!

01:22:49.381 --> 01:22:50.461
On your cans!

01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:52.961
Let's get on!
Sit your asses down, now! Let's go!

01:22:57.764 --> 01:23:00.881
You guys,
we don't have much time.

01:23:05.397 --> 01:23:07.809
We can no longer wear
the uniform of a soldier.

01:23:08.400 --> 01:23:09.685
We forfeited that right.

01:23:10.652 --> 01:23:11.892
And that includes me.

01:23:13.197 --> 01:23:15.028
I disobeyed an executive order.

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:18.031
I violated my duty
as a commanding officer.

01:23:19.828 --> 01:23:22.695
And eight men paid a catastrophic price.

01:23:24.583 --> 01:23:26.824
It's a mistake not easy to live with.

01:23:27.586 --> 01:23:30.578
So, here I am, just like you,
a convicted criminal.

01:23:31.798 --> 01:23:35.256
The only difference between you and me
is, I know I'm guilty.

01:23:37.596 --> 01:23:39.587
So we're packed away here as prisoners.

01:23:42.434 --> 01:23:43.674
And one thing is certain.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.260
Our captors have the power.

01:23:48.065 --> 01:23:49.601
They can try to humiliate us.

01:23:50.359 --> 01:23:51.359
They can beat us.

01:23:51.777 --> 01:23:54.314
They can lock us away
in a dark hole for days on end.

01:23:54.446 --> 01:23:56.027
But there's one thing they cannot do.

01:23:56.990 --> 01:23:59.572
They cannot take away
from us who we are.

01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:02.992
And we are soldiers.

01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:04.695
Yeah, that's right.

01:24:04.790 --> 01:24:08.078
It is the one thing...
That gives us a chance in here.

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:12.336
And that nobody can ever take away.

01:24:12.589 --> 01:24:14.329
Yeah, that's right.

01:24:18.637 --> 01:24:21.174
The uniform code of military justice.

01:24:23.183 --> 01:24:27.096
"Grounds for removal of a stockade
or disciplinary barracks commander.

01:24:27.938 --> 01:24:31.522
- One. Dereliction of duty.”
- That's right. Yeah.

01:24:31.608 --> 01:24:33.394
"Two. Criminal malfeasance.

01:24:34.278 --> 01:24:37.065
Three. Noncompliance
with procedural rules."

01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:38.190
Yeah.

01:24:38.282 --> 01:24:40.944
"Four. Making false official statements.

01:24:41.868 --> 01:24:45.110
Five. Conduct unbecoming
to an officer and gentleman."

01:24:45.205 --> 01:24:47.321
Yeah!

01:24:47.541 --> 01:24:51.580
"Six. Cruelty and maltreatment
of persons under his command."

01:24:51.712 --> 01:24:53.248
Hell, yeah.

01:24:56.008 --> 01:24:57.123
"Seven.

01:24:57.217 --> 01:25:01.051
Command failure resulting
in loss of control of facility."

01:25:03.015 --> 01:25:08.305
Gentlemen, I propose
that we seize control of this facility.

01:25:26.038 --> 01:25:28.120
Take a look at a castle, any castle.

01:25:28.290 --> 01:25:31.123
Now, break down the key elements
that make it a castle.

01:25:31.835 --> 01:25:36.374
Location. Protection. Garrison. Flag.

01:25:36.798 --> 01:25:39.130
The only difference between this castle
and all the rest is

01:25:39.217 --> 01:25:41.924
- they were built fo keep people out.
- Forward.

01:25:42.763 --> 01:25:44.719
This castle was built fo keep people in.

01:25:45.182 --> 01:25:46.422
But it's still a castle.

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:49.015
Any castle can be taken,

01:25:49.102 --> 01:25:51.809
whether you're fighting
in the 14th century or the 21st.

01:25:54.983 --> 01:25:57.065
To succeed in a castle war,

01:25:58.320 --> 01:25:59.810
you overcome the Garrison,

01:26:00.530 --> 01:26:04.944
take the high ground,
and ultimately, capture the flag.

01:26:05.535 --> 01:26:06.945
Okay? Enriquez.

01:26:09.623 --> 01:26:12.831
All right. You set up
a command post, okay?

01:26:13.418 --> 01:26:15.158
And here, you have the guard...

01:26:15.253 --> 01:26:17.369
First of all, this is admin building,

01:26:17.798 --> 01:26:20.255
winter's office, guards.

01:26:20.634 --> 01:26:24.422
Okay? Phase one,
neutralize winter's guards.

01:26:24.638 --> 01:26:26.219
Phase two, towers.

01:26:26.431 --> 01:26:28.422
You control the towers,
you control the yard.

01:26:28.975 --> 01:26:31.512
Tower one, tower two,
tower three, tower four.

01:26:31.603 --> 01:26:32.968
Tower four is zamorro...

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:34.480
Guy to watch.

01:26:36.316 --> 01:26:37.806
Phase three, water Cannon.

01:26:40.696 --> 01:26:42.027
Four, helicopter.

01:26:43.657 --> 01:26:45.363
Helicopter's the high ground.

01:26:46.118 --> 01:26:48.029
Taking the helicopter's
gonna be a bitch.

01:26:49.913 --> 01:26:51.073
But it's doable.

01:26:51.707 --> 01:26:53.072
Finally, the flag.

01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.120
Capture the flag.

01:26:56.628 --> 01:26:58.960
We capture the flag,
we raise it upside down.

01:26:59.089 --> 01:27:00.545
- Distress.
- Right.

01:27:02.175 --> 01:27:04.541
Right. Upside down means,

01:27:04.636 --> 01:27:07.673
"send help.
The fort has fallen."

01:27:07.806 --> 01:27:09.137
We raise it upside down,

01:27:09.224 --> 01:27:11.840
and keep it that way
until Wheeler arrives and sees it.

01:27:12.269 --> 01:27:13.475
Then, we've won.

01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:16.432
Yates, shut the...
You see what I mean about him?

01:27:17.023 --> 01:27:19.480
Hey, yates,
what are you doing here?

01:27:19.568 --> 01:27:21.229
I don't know. Ask him. He invited me.

01:27:21.319 --> 01:27:24.482
I know his father served
with you in Vietnam,

01:27:25.365 --> 01:27:26.855
but do we need him around?

01:27:27.409 --> 01:27:29.070
Yeah. He stays.

01:27:29.327 --> 01:27:32.535
- Duffy, you're in maintenance?
- Yes, sir.

01:27:40.046 --> 01:27:41.046
Yates.

01:27:42.674 --> 01:27:43.709
Got a minute?

01:27:46.094 --> 01:27:47.254
How am I doin'?

01:27:48.013 --> 01:27:50.345
Five-to-two,
in the colonel's favor.

01:27:52.309 --> 01:27:53.799
You don't think I can win.

01:27:54.519 --> 01:27:55.679
He knows too...

01:27:57.105 --> 01:27:59.812
He knows too much.
He's prepared. He's ready.

01:28:00.192 --> 01:28:02.399
He may be prepared, yates,
but he's not ready.

01:28:03.737 --> 01:28:04.977
We can use you.

01:28:05.363 --> 01:28:07.979
Look man, I just want
to survive this and go home.

01:28:10.410 --> 01:28:11.616
You make a deal with him?

01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:13.781
- What?
- That's what I would do if I were you.

01:28:14.206 --> 01:28:16.162
Go to you.
He knows what you're capable of.

01:28:16.500 --> 01:28:17.831
- Listen...
- But so do I.

01:28:19.252 --> 01:28:22.369
Oh, yeah?
Well, I know what you're capable of.

01:28:22.839 --> 01:28:25.125
- I know your type very well.
- Is that right?

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:28.257
From your years of experience
on the battlefield?

01:28:29.346 --> 01:28:31.007
Why do you think I should help you?

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:33.388
- Can you get me out of here?
- No.

01:28:33.475 --> 01:28:36.638
Then what are you gonna do for me?
Make me a soldier again?

01:28:36.728 --> 01:28:38.013
Is that what you'll do”?

01:28:38.104 --> 01:28:40.641
I get to be all I can be?
You gonna teach me to salute?

01:28:40.732 --> 01:28:42.017
This is about the time

01:28:42.108 --> 01:28:44.770
I would be giving you
my internal soldier speech.

01:28:45.529 --> 01:28:48.896
But the truth is, you probably
never should've been a soldier.

01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:52.987
Your father was.
That's how I saw him.

01:28:53.078 --> 01:28:56.195
You saw him as a disappointment.
Okay. Get past it.

01:28:56.706 --> 01:28:57.786
That was then.

01:28:58.166 --> 01:29:01.329
Only thing that matters is
what we are and what we do now.

01:29:01.795 --> 01:29:05.333
Winter wants to use the worst in you.
He's going to play for it.

01:29:05.423 --> 01:29:06.503
I want to see the best.

01:29:07.008 --> 01:29:09.670
That means there's no middle.
Now, these men need you.

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:12.760
And I need you.
Now, it's your choice.

01:29:14.474 --> 01:29:16.339
And don't tell me
you're surviving here.

01:29:16.434 --> 01:29:17.469
You're hiding.

01:29:25.569 --> 01:29:28.606
- How's it going this evening, sir?
- Fine, sergeant. How are you?

01:29:28.989 --> 01:29:29.989
Sir?

01:29:30.782 --> 01:29:33.068
Prisoner yates
wishes to have a word.

01:29:36.580 --> 01:29:38.286
Give me five minutes, captain.

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:44.124
Hi.

01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:48.080
Colonel winter's office.

01:29:48.592 --> 01:29:50.674
Yeah, go ahead and just send it up.

01:29:55.307 --> 01:29:56.307
Sir.

01:29:57.726 --> 01:29:59.341
Er 3 ==

01:29:59.436 --> 01:30:00.471
prisoner yates.

01:30:06.359 --> 01:30:08.065
You want me to do this thing for you?

01:30:09.237 --> 01:30:10.773
This 30 days...

01:30:10.906 --> 01:30:14.865
This three months, it's not gonna cut it.
I got to get out of here immediately,

01:30:14.951 --> 01:30:16.441
get out of here tomorrow.

01:30:17.662 --> 01:30:19.448
I'm afraid that's not possible.

01:30:19.623 --> 01:30:22.114
Look, when this thing explodes,

01:30:22.208 --> 01:30:24.164
everyone's gonna know
it was me who yakked.

01:30:24.669 --> 01:30:26.125
Then my life's worth nothing.

01:30:26.755 --> 01:30:29.747
So, either you get me
out of here immediately,

01:30:29.925 --> 01:30:32.291
or you find another guy
who knows as much as I do

01:30:32.385 --> 01:30:34.922
and who's willing
to spill it. Good luck.

01:30:37.766 --> 01:30:41.099
- I can get you out in one week.
- Sir, I'm not gonna last...

01:30:41.728 --> 01:30:44.265
I won't last seven seconds
let alone seven days.

01:30:44.439 --> 01:30:47.931
You can ride the week out in the hole.
No one will get you there.

01:30:52.405 --> 01:30:55.943
So what does Mr. irwin
have planned for us?

01:30:56.368 --> 01:30:58.233
He's planning
to take over the prison.

01:30:59.454 --> 01:31:00.454
Really.

01:31:01.831 --> 01:31:04.072
Well, that information
won't get you released.

01:31:04.167 --> 01:31:07.330
That information won't even get
you extra potatoes at lunch.

01:31:07.504 --> 01:31:08.789
I know the details.

01:31:09.547 --> 01:31:11.754
I know how he plans
to neutralize your men,

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:14.124
how he plans to take over the tower,

01:31:14.219 --> 01:31:16.084
what weapons and tools he's building.

01:31:19.432 --> 01:31:21.764
- Do you know when?
- Yates, I know you're in there!

01:31:22.435 --> 01:31:24.676
- Yates, I know you're in there!
- Cutbush!

01:31:25.355 --> 01:31:27.937
You're a fucker, yates!
You are gonna snitch!

01:31:28.024 --> 01:31:30.185
Cutbush, shut up!
Cutbush, get down!

01:31:30.276 --> 01:31:32.858
Shut up! Niebolt,
what's he doing up here?

01:31:32.946 --> 01:31:35.107
He brought up the laundry,
and went ape, sir.

01:31:36.783 --> 01:31:39.525
No one talks to him,
or sees him. Understand?

01:31:39.661 --> 01:31:41.138
- Yes, sir!
- There's a guard in his cell.

01:31:41.162 --> 01:31:43.448
- Damn rat!
- What's the problem?

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:45.810
My mother's sick.
I'm trying to get a furlough.

01:31:45.834 --> 01:31:47.540
- Shut up!
- Get him out of here!

01:31:47.752 --> 01:31:48.867
Captain, with me.

01:31:53.174 --> 01:31:54.664
Oh, Jesus, man.

01:31:55.635 --> 01:31:58.593
Now you have no choice,
or you're going

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:01.217
to spend the next three years
in solitary confinement.

01:32:03.518 --> 01:32:04.633
I need more time.

01:32:05.854 --> 01:32:07.469
I got to go back into general.

01:32:08.648 --> 01:32:11.811
I'll know somethin' tomorrow.
Come get me at 0500.

01:32:12.861 --> 01:32:14.226
I need more time!

01:32:16.197 --> 01:32:19.439
Inmates, one step to the rear. March!

01:33:19.385 --> 01:33:21.171
Sir? Where's yates' cell?

01:33:21.262 --> 01:33:23.378
Yates? It's 340, sir.

01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:33.805
You ready to play?

01:33:34.567 --> 01:33:35.898
- Morning, sir.
- Fall out.

01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:40.280
Colonel?

01:33:42.575 --> 01:33:43.575
Colonel.

01:33:49.541 --> 01:33:50.541
Good morning.

01:33:52.127 --> 01:33:53.127
Good morning.

01:33:56.297 --> 01:33:57.833
What do you have for me?

01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:04.344
- Not much.
- Not much.

01:34:07.433 --> 01:34:08.843
Then why are you here?

01:34:11.437 --> 01:34:13.644
I thought there was something
you might want to know.

01:34:16.359 --> 01:34:19.442
When they take over the prison,
they're going to fly the flag upside down.

01:34:20.155 --> 01:34:21.190
Upside down?

01:34:21.364 --> 01:34:23.124
It's the international sign
of distress, sir.

01:34:23.158 --> 01:34:24.739
Yes, I know what it means.

01:34:26.953 --> 01:34:28.909
Where are they going to get a flag?

01:34:29.956 --> 01:34:33.198
They already have it. Yours.

01:34:34.127 --> 01:34:35.127
Mine?

01:34:46.181 --> 01:34:47.512
Who was in here yesterday?

01:34:47.599 --> 01:34:49.510
I took it, you murdering fuck.

01:34:56.065 --> 01:34:57.851
I thought you were smarter than that.

01:34:58.902 --> 01:35:00.108
Yes, I know you did.

01:35:06.868 --> 01:35:08.824
You gonna tell us where that flag is?

01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:12.783
Come on. Get up, yates.
Where's the flag?

01:35:16.628 --> 01:35:18.710
You're a real fuckin' coward, zamorro.

01:35:18.796 --> 01:35:21.629
And you're a big hero.
Let's go. Come on.

01:35:21.716 --> 01:35:23.377
Get your hands off me,
motherfucker!

01:35:24.135 --> 01:35:25.466
Fuckin' prick!

01:35:26.846 --> 01:35:28.086
Shut up, yates!

01:35:43.947 --> 01:35:47.189
All inmates on the rack.
This is a shakedown.

01:35:49.202 --> 01:35:50.442
Go, go!

01:35:51.037 --> 01:35:53.278
- Come on! Fall out!
- Let's go!

01:35:54.082 --> 01:35:57.245
All inmates proceed fo the yard
through the south ports.

01:36:03.758 --> 01:36:05.339
On the double! Move it!

01:36:05.718 --> 01:36:07.834
Come on. Go, go!

01:36:10.014 --> 01:36:11.220
Go! Go! Move it!

01:36:13.142 --> 01:36:14.348
Go! Go! Go!

01:36:15.478 --> 01:36:16.558
This way, chief.

01:36:16.646 --> 01:36:17.681
Let's go! Move it!

01:36:24.028 --> 01:36:25.188
Over there, sir.

01:36:26.364 --> 01:36:28.571
- It's crazy, huh?
- Let's go! Step it up!

01:36:29.284 --> 01:36:31.195
- Come on! Let's go!
- Really crazy.

01:36:31.286 --> 01:36:32.867
Move it, prisoners!

01:36:33.913 --> 01:36:35.323
- Go!
- All right!

01:36:44.799 --> 01:36:48.212
Captain peretz,
you will find my flag.

01:36:57.729 --> 01:36:58.935
6:10.

01:37:01.107 --> 01:37:02.187
6:10.

01:37:13.244 --> 01:37:15.826
I don't wanna hear that.
You have your orders.

01:37:15.913 --> 01:37:17.073
Find the damn thing.

01:37:18.416 --> 01:37:20.327
Sir, they found a lot of weaponry.

01:37:21.461 --> 01:37:23.668
- But no flag.
- No, sir.

01:37:24.881 --> 01:37:26.667
At least we have all their weapons.

01:37:27.425 --> 01:37:29.165
There's nothing much
they can do now.

01:37:35.266 --> 01:37:37.552
How many men do we have
searching the tiers?

01:37:38.353 --> 01:37:39.593
We have close to 100.

01:37:40.313 --> 01:37:41.974
Pretty much everybody we could get.

01:37:43.733 --> 01:37:45.314
It's not about the flag.

01:37:45.860 --> 01:37:47.566
He wants to be in the yard.

01:37:48.112 --> 01:37:50.398
Get our men out of the tiers
and into the yard now.

01:37:51.991 --> 01:37:53.697
Everybody into the yard!

01:37:53.785 --> 01:37:56.527
Riot formation!
Let's go! Double time!

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:05.420
Now!

01:38:09.175 --> 01:38:10.790
- Peretz!
- Yes, sir!

01:38:10.885 --> 01:38:14.252
Get those men into the yard, now!
Alert the s.O.R.T. Teams. Go, go!

01:38:18.684 --> 01:38:20.049
Chain, chain, chain.

01:38:27.110 --> 01:38:28.110
All right.

01:38:31.948 --> 01:38:34.030
How's it feel, huh?
How's it feel?

01:38:34.659 --> 01:38:35.899
Bring him with us.

01:38:37.954 --> 01:38:39.239
To the holel

01:38:41.416 --> 01:38:43.247
command post up, fast!

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:53.966
Put me down!

01:38:54.220 --> 01:38:55.960
You know what's gonna happen to you?

01:38:57.306 --> 01:38:59.672
- Go, go, go!
- Let us out!

01:39:00.017 --> 01:39:03.851
- Hey! Beaupre, is that you?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:39:04.272 --> 01:39:07.139
- Is it happening?
- Fuckin' a it's happening.

01:39:10.778 --> 01:39:11.813
Damn it!

01:39:12.905 --> 01:39:14.736
They chained the doors to the tiers.

01:39:15.867 --> 01:39:17.357
Yes. I can see that.

01:39:18.619 --> 01:39:20.575
It's gonna take a while to get around.

01:39:22.331 --> 01:39:25.198
When they get here,
tell them to gear up, but hold them.

01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:28.622
They'll expect us
to come hard and fast, so we won't.

01:39:28.713 --> 01:39:32.001
Whoa! Hey!

01:39:32.300 --> 01:39:33.585
Yates, you little prick.

01:39:33.676 --> 01:39:35.758
I bet against you
and lost a stash of smokes.

01:39:35.845 --> 01:39:37.756
Yeah? There's a lot of losers today.

01:39:49.692 --> 01:39:50.807
What's the deal?

01:39:51.652 --> 01:39:53.608
Come on, zamorro,
you motherfucker!

01:39:53.821 --> 01:39:57.109
Come on! Come on!
You fucking believe this guy?

01:39:57.283 --> 01:39:59.865
Okay, let's go.
Here we go. Let's go. Let's go.

01:40:00.912 --> 01:40:02.823
- Get it out right now.
- Later, later.

01:40:09.003 --> 01:40:12.666
Listen to me. The colonel
said to hold them, okay?

01:40:12.757 --> 01:40:13.757
Hold them.

01:40:17.345 --> 01:40:20.963
Sir, maybe we should call
c.A.C. And get general Wheeler.

01:40:23.184 --> 01:40:24.640
And say what, captain?

01:40:25.645 --> 01:40:28.136
Colonel winter has lost control
of his own prison?

01:40:32.527 --> 01:40:34.609
Keenan! Keenan,
you ready to go up, man?

01:40:34.695 --> 01:40:35.775
Yes, sir!

01:40:38.741 --> 01:40:40.402
The trajectory is going to be there.

01:40:45.998 --> 01:40:47.204
Where do you want me?

01:40:48.876 --> 01:40:51.583
This is sergeant mclaren
from fort Truman prison.

01:40:51.671 --> 01:40:53.286
Can I speak to general Wheeler?

01:40:55.341 --> 01:40:58.128
Well, you're gonna have to
wake the dude up, man.

01:40:58.219 --> 01:40:59.550
This is from colonel winter.

01:41:00.429 --> 01:41:02.545
We're having, like, an uprising here.

01:41:05.518 --> 01:41:06.849
Go. Launch when ready.

01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:09.430
Go, go, go! Come on!

01:41:14.110 --> 01:41:15.395
Light her up.

01:41:15.945 --> 01:41:17.105
Fire!

01:41:28.666 --> 01:41:33.160
Sir. Colonel,
he wants to talk to you.

01:41:34.463 --> 01:41:36.954
- Who does?
- Him.

01:41:46.892 --> 01:41:47.892
Yes?

01:41:49.186 --> 01:41:52.895
Colonel, I'm taking command
of your prison.

01:41:55.526 --> 01:41:56.766
Like hell you are.

01:42:01.449 --> 01:42:02.985
Come on, guys! Let's go!

01:42:03.367 --> 01:42:05.449
Stop fuckin' around!
We don't got much time!

01:42:05.536 --> 01:42:07.868
- Let's go! Come on, let's go!
- Dellwo.

01:42:08.831 --> 01:42:09.946
Sir?

01:42:10.041 --> 01:42:11.121
How close to ready?

01:42:11.417 --> 01:42:13.078
Fuck! We're almost there, sir.

01:42:13.210 --> 01:42:15.542
Sir, could... could you come here, please?

01:42:23.179 --> 01:42:24.385
What is that?

01:42:24.972 --> 01:42:26.712
That thing tucked away in the alley.

01:42:29.268 --> 01:42:30.383
I don't know.

01:42:37.026 --> 01:42:38.436
Release the wave.

01:42:43.199 --> 01:42:45.155
Come on! Get it up!

01:43:10.142 --> 01:43:12.508
Go ahead and deploy
red and blue teams.

01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:15.515
Let's go!

01:43:15.606 --> 01:43:16.971
Come on! Move!

01:43:22.196 --> 01:43:23.196
Defend!

01:43:39.797 --> 01:43:42.880
Lock and load
the fucking thing now!

01:43:44.427 --> 01:43:45.712
Take it up.

01:43:46.470 --> 01:43:48.586
Light her! Fire!

01:43:51.934 --> 01:43:53.595
Gun! Bring me the gun!

01:43:53.686 --> 01:43:54.926
Bring me the gun!

01:43:58.399 --> 01:44:00.856
Bring it! Bring it!
Let's go! Come on!

01:44:00.943 --> 01:44:03.559
Load her up. Load her up.
Charlie, you ready?

01:44:03.654 --> 01:44:05.019
- Set!
- Clear! Fire!

01:44:09.160 --> 01:44:10.821
Fuck me! It worked, man!

01:44:13.289 --> 01:44:14.324
Fire!

01:44:26.302 --> 01:44:28.588
- Dellwo.
- Sir?

01:44:28.679 --> 01:44:30.215
Move ten feet forward.

01:44:30.765 --> 01:44:31.845
Yes, sir.

01:44:31.932 --> 01:44:34.765
Ten feet forward!

01:44:39.315 --> 01:44:42.182
Zamorro, target the man
loading the rocks into the trebuchet.

01:44:42.276 --> 01:44:44.232
Do not let him put another one in.

01:44:44.653 --> 01:44:46.735
Dellwo, you gonna make it this time?

01:44:46.989 --> 01:44:48.195
You betcha, sir.

01:44:49.700 --> 01:44:51.065
Then now is the time.

01:44:51.452 --> 01:44:53.784
All the way, sir!
Airborne! Hey, Jack!

01:44:53.871 --> 01:44:56.078
- What?
- This is the one! Get it!

01:44:56.165 --> 01:44:59.328
Come on. No, no, no, no.
This one in the middle.

01:45:01.629 --> 01:45:04.712
- Come on, baby.
- Firel

01:45:26.987 --> 01:45:29.353
- Fire!
- Sir!

01:45:44.713 --> 01:45:46.499
Come on! Hold it there!

01:45:46.590 --> 01:45:48.330
Get it in there! Last one!

01:45:48.801 --> 01:45:50.291
Make it count! Make it...

01:46:00.563 --> 01:46:02.679
- Be still!
- Put it out! Put it out!

01:46:04.608 --> 01:46:05.643
Hey! It's out!

01:46:05.734 --> 01:46:07.975
You never can tell
about these flames, man.

01:46:10.698 --> 01:46:12.529
Told you
I was gonna get your ass back.

01:46:14.034 --> 01:46:15.034
Sir.

01:46:18.581 --> 01:46:19.616
Sir.

01:46:22.209 --> 01:46:23.574
Watch the window.

01:46:35.222 --> 01:46:37.178
Get that water Cannon now.

01:46:42.354 --> 01:46:47.849
- Duffy. Duffy?
- Just a few more minutes, sir.

01:46:48.152 --> 01:46:50.313
Fall back! Fall back!

01:46:51.196 --> 01:46:54.063
All personnel, fall back!

01:46:54.158 --> 01:46:55.523
Come on! Faster!

01:47:07.463 --> 01:47:10.170
Come on, Duffy.
What are you doing? Cut it off.

01:47:10.507 --> 01:47:11.507
Keep it going!

01:47:13.469 --> 01:47:17.508
Let's shift to the c.P.!
Shift to the c.P.! Now! Go!

01:47:49.046 --> 01:47:51.207
Duffy, what are you doing?

01:47:56.887 --> 01:47:57.967
Yes!

01:48:01.517 --> 01:48:03.178
Charge!

01:48:04.603 --> 01:48:05.603
Shit!

01:48:23.831 --> 01:48:26.447
You coward motherfucker, winter!

01:48:27.001 --> 01:48:28.537
Colonel, it's your private line.

01:48:29.211 --> 01:48:32.669
- Get it.
- U.S.M.C.F. Colonel winter's office.

01:48:34.466 --> 01:48:36.502
Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Please hold.

01:48:37.636 --> 01:48:38.796
It's general Wheeler.

01:48:41.140 --> 01:48:44.257
We're on our way, colonel.
There in 20 minutes.

01:48:45.060 --> 01:48:46.300
I don't understand, sir.

01:48:46.770 --> 01:48:49.056
You have a prison uprising.
You sent for help.

01:48:49.148 --> 01:48:50.513
No, no. I...

01:48:53.986 --> 01:48:56.693
We have the situation under control, sir.
We're just...

01:48:57.573 --> 01:49:00.235
- Mopping up now.
- Good.

01:49:00.325 --> 01:49:03.112
Glad to hear it.
We'll see you in 20 then.

01:49:05.831 --> 01:49:07.116
Very good, sir.

01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:19.587
I want this over. Now.
Get them airborne.

01:49:32.816 --> 01:49:33.931
Okay.

01:49:48.916 --> 01:49:50.122
Load the water Cannon.

01:49:50.209 --> 01:49:52.291
Go, go! Come on, man!

01:50:01.512 --> 01:50:03.252
All right, give me the grapple!

01:50:04.556 --> 01:50:06.842
Hurry up! Hook it on!

01:50:09.603 --> 01:50:11.218
Where's the fuckin' water?

01:50:22.908 --> 01:50:23.908
Now.

01:50:44.680 --> 01:50:45.965
We're hooked!

01:50:47.474 --> 01:50:48.680
Go, yates!

01:50:52.855 --> 01:50:54.436
Sir, I think that's yates.

01:50:55.649 --> 01:50:56.649
Yes, I know.

01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:04.480
Hold on!

01:51:26.263 --> 01:51:27.263
Where is he?

01:51:36.356 --> 01:51:39.143
Hey! What are you doing? Hey!

01:51:58.879 --> 01:51:59.994
Get this guy out!

01:52:01.089 --> 01:52:02.625
Clear out. I'm going up.

01:52:03.008 --> 01:52:06.375
Zamorro, take him out.
Stop him! Stop him!

01:52:23.528 --> 01:52:26.019
To hell with this rubber-bullet shit.

01:52:47.469 --> 01:52:48.549
Come on!

01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:23.664
Come on.

01:53:24.506 --> 01:53:25.541
Oh, no.

01:53:29.094 --> 01:53:31.710
- I never wrecked one before.
- Don't talk. Go. Move.

01:53:31.805 --> 01:53:34.012
Go! Get out! Go!

01:54:15.515 --> 01:54:16.550
You okay, yates?

01:54:18.268 --> 01:54:19.268
Let's go.

01:54:51.676 --> 01:54:53.917
Ready? Yeah.

01:54:55.305 --> 01:54:56.511
Fall in!

01:54:56.890 --> 01:54:58.130
Let's go, men!

01:54:58.225 --> 01:55:00.307
In formation, now!
On the double!

01:55:00.769 --> 01:55:02.885
Let's go, soldiers! Now!

01:55:04.481 --> 01:55:05.516
Let's go!

01:55:11.863 --> 01:55:13.273
Dress right!

01:55:14.533 --> 01:55:15.533
Dress!

01:55:22.499 --> 01:55:25.457
Ready, front!

01:55:27.838 --> 01:55:28.838
Cover!

01:55:41.101 --> 01:55:42.432
The men are assembled, sir.

01:56:34.446 --> 01:56:37.734
First and second squad, move out.
Third and fourth squad, move out.

01:57:17.739 --> 01:57:21.402
I have authorized the use
of lethal ammunition at this facility.

01:57:21.910 --> 01:57:25.778
Any prisoner who refuses
to obey my commands will be shot.

01:57:37.676 --> 01:57:39.667
All prisoners
down on the ground,

01:57:40.053 --> 01:57:41.053
now!

01:57:59.698 --> 01:58:02.314
I will give that command
one more time.

01:58:03.285 --> 01:58:04.741
Then I will fire into them.

01:58:06.288 --> 01:58:10.076
You don't want that on your conscience,
do you, prisoner irwin?

01:58:17.424 --> 01:58:20.757
All prisoners down on the ground, now!

01:58:40.864 --> 01:58:41.864
Wait.

01:58:50.040 --> 01:58:52.031
We don't have to do this.
We'll fight on.

01:58:52.125 --> 01:58:55.162
No. It ends here.

01:59:02.302 --> 01:59:03.542
Men, get down!

01:59:26.910 --> 01:59:27.945
You, too, yates.

01:59:33.625 --> 01:59:34.660
That's an order.

01:59:57.816 --> 02:00:01.024
Now, give me my flag.

02:00:06.282 --> 02:00:07.818
It's not your flag.

02:00:17.377 --> 02:00:19.083
What are you doing, Mr. irwin”?

02:00:20.880 --> 02:00:22.086
You have lost.

02:00:23.216 --> 02:00:27.255
I will not let you do this.
You will not raise that flag upside down!

02:00:28.221 --> 02:00:30.883
Get down on the ground
or you will be fired upon.

02:00:30.974 --> 02:00:32.464
This is my command!

02:00:32.559 --> 02:00:34.925
You will not raise
that flag upside down!

02:00:36.730 --> 02:00:39.312
Designated marksman, open fire.

02:00:51.161 --> 02:00:53.243
Selected marksman, open fire.

02:01:02.088 --> 02:01:04.420
Open fire on that man!
That's an order!

02:01:10.513 --> 02:01:12.094
What are they doing?

02:01:12.474 --> 02:01:15.136
What are you doing?
Do it now! Open fire!

02:01:15.351 --> 02:01:17.888
Do not let him desecrate that flag!

02:01:18.438 --> 02:01:20.099
Open fire on that man!

02:01:26.529 --> 02:01:27.894
What are they doing?

02:01:29.157 --> 02:01:30.613
Mclaren, niebolt, with me!

02:01:30.867 --> 02:01:32.232
Niebolt, stay where you are.

02:01:34.913 --> 02:01:36.119
Don't you defy me.

02:01:36.206 --> 02:01:39.539
Don't you see what he's doing?
He's undermining my command!

02:01:39.709 --> 02:01:40.915
Don't you see?

02:01:41.586 --> 02:01:45.078
Don't you see what he's doing?

02:01:52.263 --> 02:01:56.097
Step away from the flag!
Step away from the flag!

02:02:04.651 --> 02:02:05.651
Colonel!

02:02:06.986 --> 02:02:09.272
Colonel, put the gun down, sir.

02:02:11.658 --> 02:02:12.658
Please...

02:02:14.494 --> 02:02:15.984
Please, put the gun down.

02:02:17.956 --> 02:02:18.956
Colonel.

02:02:26.214 --> 02:02:27.704
Sir, it's over now.

02:02:29.259 --> 02:02:30.499
Just give it to me.

02:02:42.522 --> 02:02:44.058
Prisoners, stay down.

02:02:46.526 --> 02:02:47.526
Hey, doc!

02:02:47.861 --> 02:02:48.861
Go now!

02:02:49.946 --> 02:02:51.652
Mclaren, get 'em back in the tiers.

02:02:51.739 --> 02:02:54.071
A team, b team, move out now.

02:02:57.287 --> 02:02:58.902
Let's go!
Hands behind your head!

02:02:59.372 --> 02:03:00.657
All right! On your feet!

02:03:05.378 --> 02:03:07.414
Let's go, people.
Hands behind your head.

02:03:14.387 --> 02:03:16.469
Prisoners will return to the cell block.

02:03:25.899 --> 02:03:28.231
- Come on, doc.
- I gotta stop his bleeding.

02:03:28.318 --> 02:03:30.980
- An ambulance is on the way.
- Get him to the hospital.

02:04:55.321 --> 02:04:56.902
A great general once said...

02:04:58.992 --> 02:05:02.735
"You tell your men,
"you're soldiers. That's our flag.'

02:05:04.330 --> 02:05:06.412
you tell them,
nobody takes our flag.

02:05:07.625 --> 02:05:10.662
Raise your flag so it flies high
where everyone can see it.

02:05:14.424 --> 02:05:16.881
Now, you've got yourself a castle.”
