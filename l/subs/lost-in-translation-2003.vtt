then we'll go to a jazz club.

04:34.357 --> 04:35.484
Yeah.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.277
You see that guy?

04:37.360 --> 04:38.361
Yeah.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.863
You know who that is?

04:39.946 --> 04:40.989
It's not him.

04:41.072 --> 04:43.074
It looks like him,
but it's not him.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.076
Can you believe it?

04:45.160 --> 04:46.203
Okay, maybe it is.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.662
He's here with us. I'm
gonna go talk to him.

04:47.746 --> 04:48.955
Shut up. Shut up.

04:49.039 --> 04:52.083
Bob? Bob Harris?
You're awesome, man!

04:52.167 --> 04:54.169
<i>Sunset odds. Loved it.</i>

04:54.252 --> 04:57.005
Man, that car chase,
i couldn't believe it.

04:57.088 --> 05:00.008
Fourbusesu. And he took that
thing and everything exploded.

05:00.091 --> 05:02.177
I heard he did
his own driving.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.929
Did you do
your own driving?

05:04.054 --> 05:05.388
I did.
Cool.

05:05.472 --> 05:06.848
So, what are you
doing here?

05:06.932 --> 05:08.141
Yeah.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.686
Seeing friends.
Seeing friends.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.688
Yeah?
Great.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.065
We're here on business.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.650
<i>I can see it in your eyes</i>

05:16.733 --> 05:17.943
later.

05:17.984 --> 05:19.110
See you, Bob.
Keep it up.

06:20.714 --> 06:22.382
Are you awake?

06:26.845 --> 06:28.346
John.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.934
Go to sleep.

07:39.918 --> 07:41.836
Yeah,
I'm coming down.

07:42.754 --> 07:43.797
Okay.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.841
I gotta go to work.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.009
Okay.

07:48.093 --> 07:49.594
I love you.
I'll see you later.

07:49.678 --> 07:50.762
Okay. Bye.

08:54.075 --> 08:55.285
Mr. Bob-San.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.169
Suntory whisky.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.767
Casablanca. Bogie.

09:20.351 --> 09:21.728
Suntory time.

09:22.645 --> 09:25.273
He want you to turn,
look in camera.

09:26.024 --> 09:27.233
Okay?

09:28.485 --> 09:29.611
That's all he said?

09:29.694 --> 09:30.820
Yes.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.322
Turn to camera.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.495
All right, does he want me
to turn from the right,

09:38.578 --> 09:41.289
or turn from the left?

10:05.563 --> 10:08.441
Passionate. Camera. Passion.

10:08.525 --> 10:11.361
Right side and
with intensity.

10:12.153 --> 10:13.154
Okay?

10:13.571 --> 10:15.698
Is that everything? I mean,
it seemed like he said

10:15.782 --> 10:17.408
quite a bit more than that.

10:18.910 --> 10:20.870
Whisky.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.417
Gently.

10:28.211 --> 10:30.046
Tension.

10:30.130 --> 10:33.216
Like an old friend,
and into the camera.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.301
Okay.

10:37.512 --> 10:38.847
Whisky.

10:38.930 --> 10:41.850
It's suntory time! Okay?

10:42.767 --> 10:43.893
Okay.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.270
Okay?

10:47.355 --> 10:48.356
Hey, come on!

10:48.439 --> 10:49.941
Come on,
come on, come on.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.450
For relaxing times,

11:00.702 --> 11:02.412
make it suntory time.

11:03.621 --> 11:06.082
Cut-o! Cut-o, cut-o,
cut-o, cut-o, cut-o!

11:16.885 --> 11:18.261
Could you do it slower

11:18.344 --> 11:22.056
and with more intensity?

11:26.519 --> 11:27.979
Suntory time.

11:44.495 --> 11:46.372
For relaxing times,

11:48.416 --> 11:50.126
make it suntory time.

11:54.756 --> 11:56.716
Cut-o, cut-o, cut-o, cut-o!

13:14.085 --> 13:15.169
<i>Hello?</i>

13:15.253 --> 13:16.337
Lauren?

13:16.421 --> 13:17.672
<i>Charlotte! Hey!</i>

13:18.423 --> 13:19.549
Hey.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.883
<i>Oh, my god. How's Tokyo?</i>

13:20.967 --> 13:24.262
It's great here.
It's really great. Um...

13:24.679 --> 13:26.514
I don't know...
I went to this shrine today.

13:26.597 --> 13:27.598
<i>Mmm-hmm?</i>

13:27.682 --> 13:29.142
And

13:29.559 --> 13:32.478
there were these monks,
and they were chanting.

13:32.562 --> 13:36.566
And I didn't feel anything.
You know?

13:36.649 --> 13:40.069
And I don't know...

13:40.278 --> 13:43.614
Leventfiedikebana, and John
is using these hair products.

13:43.698 --> 13:45.450
L just...
I don't know who I married.

13:45.533 --> 13:47.869
<i>Look, can you wait a second? Just hold on.
I'll be right back.</i>

13:47.952 --> 13:49.329
Okay, sure.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.957
<i>Sorry. What were you saying?</i>

13:53.041 --> 13:55.084
Nothing. It's okay.
I'll call you later. Okay?

13:55.168 --> 13:59.297
<i>Okay. Have the best time. Just call
me when you get back. Okay? Bye.</i>

13:59.380 --> 14:00.631
<i>Bye.
Love you.</i>

15:08.199 --> 15:09.700
God!

15:09.951 --> 15:11.452
Ow.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.959
At the fitting today,
they had all these

15:18.042 --> 15:19.544
rock-and-roll clothes,

15:19.627 --> 15:21.462
but the band
wasn't tough at all.

15:21.546 --> 15:23.589
Thelabelguy just kept saying,
"more lock and loll,"

15:23.673 --> 15:25.091
but it's just so much better

15:25.174 --> 15:28.302
if they're just skinny and nerdy
like they came in, you know.

15:28.386 --> 15:31.013
They're making them wear all
these Keith Richards clothes,

15:31.097 --> 15:32.390
and it's just ridiculous.

15:32.473 --> 15:35.268
They should let them be who they are.
Don't you think? I mean...

15:35.351 --> 15:36.686
Yeah.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.396
Yeah, that's exactly
what I was saying.

15:38.479 --> 15:41.649
But then you try to...
I mean, you know...

15:42.567 --> 15:44.485
That's what I think.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.571
Do you think this is done?

15:49.365 --> 15:51.826
I don't know. I don't know.

15:52.994 --> 15:56.873
Would you... would you
please stop smoking?

15:56.956 --> 15:58.875
I like to. I don't really
smoke that much.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.919
It's just so bad
for you, though.

16:02.086 --> 16:03.713
Well, I'll stop later.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.685
Welcome back,
Mr. Harris.

16:17.768 --> 16:18.853
Yes, Mr. Harris.

16:18.936 --> 16:19.937
Please.

16:20.021 --> 16:21.022
Thank you.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.607
Mr. Harris?
Yes?

17:04.690 --> 17:05.858
Mr. kazu sent me.

17:05.942 --> 17:06.901
Oh?

17:06.983 --> 17:08.444
May I enter?

17:10.946 --> 17:12.073
Thank you.

17:12.156 --> 17:14.116
Do you like massage?

17:14.200 --> 17:17.912
I don't think
i like massage anymore.

17:17.994 --> 17:21.082
Mr. kazu sends
premium fantasy.

17:21.999 --> 17:25.419
My stockings, lip them.

17:28.506 --> 17:30.758
Lip my stockings.

17:32.301 --> 17:33.678
Yes, please.

17:34.303 --> 17:35.555
Lip them.

17:37.640 --> 17:38.683
What?

17:38.766 --> 17:40.184
Lip them.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.355
Hey! Lip my stocking!

17:44.438 --> 17:47.024
Hey! "Lip" them?
"Lip" them? What?

17:47.108 --> 17:50.111
Lip them. Like this.
Lip them.

17:50.194 --> 17:51.612
Rip them?
Up, yes.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.030
You want me to rip
your stockings?

17:53.114 --> 17:55.116
Yes, lip my stockings,
please.

17:55.199 --> 17:56.576
Rip your stockings.
Yes.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.619
You want me to rip your stockings.
Please? Please? Please?

17:58.703 --> 17:59.870
All right, I'm gonna
rip your stockings,

17:59.954 --> 18:02.707
and you tell Mr. kazu
we had a blast.

18:02.790 --> 18:05.543
Oh, no! Mr. Harris!
Oh, my god!

18:05.626 --> 18:07.128
Don't touch me!

18:07.211 --> 18:10.339
Mr. Bob Harris,
don't touch me!

18:10.756 --> 18:12.383
Just lip my stocking!

18:12.466 --> 18:15.094
Oh, no, Mr. Harris!

18:15.511 --> 18:17.597
Oh, no! Help! Help!

18:17.680 --> 18:18.681
Yeah. Yeah.

18:18.764 --> 18:19.890
Help, please!
Help, please!

18:19.974 --> 18:20.975
Okay.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.977
Mr. Harris, help, please.
Careful with those.

18:23.060 --> 18:24.854
Oh! Help, please!
Help, please!

18:24.937 --> 18:26.939
Come on. Come on.

18:27.023 --> 18:29.358
Let me go, Mr. Harris!

18:29.442 --> 18:30.610
Oh, no! Let me go!

18:30.693 --> 18:31.694
Come on. Come on.

18:31.777 --> 18:34.071
Oh! Let me go!
Let me go.

18:34.155 --> 18:35.156
Oh, crap.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.324
Please let me go.
With pleasure.

18:36.407 --> 18:40.995
Oh, no, Mr. Bob Harris,
don't let me go! No!

18:42.246 --> 18:45.124
No! Oh, no,
Mr. Bob Harris!

18:46.542 --> 18:48.044
Oh, please.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.503
Let me go, please!

19:35.383 --> 19:38.803
Hi! Mr. Harris,
good morning.

19:38.886 --> 19:40.012
Hi.

19:40.096 --> 19:42.515
Hello. We just got
a request from tanabe mori.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.100
He is the Johnny Carson
ofjapan.

19:44.183 --> 19:47.061
It is a big honor to
be invited to his show.

19:47.144 --> 19:49.146
Can you stay here
until Friday?

19:50.439 --> 19:54.235
I'm surprised and honored, but i
think I need to check with my agent.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.277
Okay.

19:55.361 --> 19:56.612
I believe I may have
a previous commitment.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.406
Sure.
Okay. I understand.

19:58.489 --> 19:59.990
Shall we go?
Yes.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.472
<i>I think
you should do it.</i>

20:23.556 --> 20:25.349
No, hear this, Fred.

20:25.433 --> 20:28.227
I gotta be on a plane
Thursday night.

20:28.310 --> 20:29.854
<i>We're looking
into it, Bob.</i>

20:29.937 --> 20:32.732
<i>They really want you to
stay and do that talk show.</i>

20:32.815 --> 20:35.234
<i>Apparently,
he's a really big deal...</i>

20:35.693 --> 20:38.112
Johnny Carson
of Japan. Yeah.

20:38.195 --> 20:41.615
<i>Bob, these people are paying you a lot.
Would you please consider it?</i>

20:41.699 --> 20:44.785
I already have.
I gotta get out of here.

20:44.869 --> 20:46.245
As soon as I can.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.080
<i>All right, you're
scheduled to leave Friday,</i>

20:48.164 --> 20:49.874
<i>but we'll hold it
for you Saturday.</i>

20:49.957 --> 20:51.125
All right, now...

20:51.208 --> 20:54.462
You're breaking up, Fred. There's
no reception in this studio.

20:54.545 --> 20:56.255
Forget it. Call me back.

21:04.388 --> 21:07.975
So, can you put your hand
close your face, please?

21:08.058 --> 21:09.435
I'm sorry, naka.
What?

21:09.518 --> 21:13.773
Can you put your hand olose your face?
Close your face.

21:16.901 --> 21:19.612
I don't get that close to the
glass until I'm on the floor.

21:19.695 --> 21:20.821
How's this?

21:21.989 --> 21:24.408
Yes. You want a whisky?

21:26.869 --> 21:30.456
This is not whisky. This is iced tea.
If you gave me real whisky...

21:30.539 --> 21:32.458
I need mysterious face.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.668
Can you show mysterious?
Mysterious.

21:34.752 --> 21:37.463
I think I know what you want.
You want this, right?

21:37.546 --> 21:40.174
I need more mysterious and...

21:40.424 --> 21:41.509
More mysterious. Yeah.

21:41.592 --> 21:44.553
I'll just try to think, "where
the hell's the whisky?"

21:47.431 --> 21:50.184
You are a movie star, yes?

21:50.267 --> 21:52.853
Yes, I should be doing
movies, yes, but...

21:52.937 --> 21:54.313
And lat pack.

21:54.563 --> 21:56.649
Lat pack.

23:07.344 --> 23:09.263
Okay. I...

23:09.346 --> 23:10.431
I always think of Sean Connery.
Seriously.

23:10.514 --> 23:11.599
No, no.

23:11.682 --> 23:12.850
Didn't you get the Sean
Connery one over here?

23:12.933 --> 23:14.935
<i>No. Leger Moore.

You mean "more,"
or Roger Moore again?

23:27.907 --> 23:29.742
Yeah. Yeah.

23:31.035 --> 23:32.369
Good.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.204

Oh, beautiful, man.

Good morning.
Good morning.

Good morning.
Good morning.

26:04.188 --> 26:06.190
Are you okay?
Yeah. Fine.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.610
Car is outside.
Shall we go?

26:14.114 --> 26:15.782
That's what I told him.

26:15.783 --> 26:15.866
That's what I told him.

26:16.158 --> 26:17.701
But if...
Yeah.

26:17.785 --> 26:19.536
He never listens.
Yeah.

26:22.706 --> 26:24.374
John?

26:24.750 --> 26:27.544
Oh, my god! John!
What are you doing here?

26:27.878 --> 26:31.632
Oh, well, you know, I'm
just here, shooting a band.

26:31.715 --> 26:32.716
What about you?

26:32.800 --> 26:34.009
I'm here promoting that
action movie I did.

26:35.177 --> 26:38.138
You know! I'm doing 20
million interviews a day.

26:38.222 --> 26:39.807
It's crazy.

26:39.890 --> 26:41.100
God, it is so good
to see you!

26:41.183 --> 26:42.184
Yeah. Yeah.

26:42.267 --> 26:43.811
So, how long are you
gonna be here?

26:43.894 --> 26:45.938
We're here for a week.

26:46.021 --> 26:47.481
I'm gonna go shoot
in fukawaka.

26:48.649 --> 26:50.067
Oh, it's amazing!
Yeah.

26:50.192 --> 26:51.985
It's amazing.
Oh, yeah.

26:55.280 --> 26:58.158
Oh, this is... this is
my wife, Charlotte.

26:58.242 --> 26:59.660
Hi! It's really nice
to meet you!

26:59.743 --> 27:00.911
Hi. Nice to meet you.

27:00.994 --> 27:02.412
Hello!
Yeah!

27:03.747 --> 27:05.707
Wife?
Yeah. Yeah.

27:06.583 --> 27:08.418
John.John.
Huh?

27:08.502 --> 27:09.878
You are my favorite
photographer.

27:09.962 --> 27:10.963
Oh, come on!

27:11.046 --> 27:12.923
No, you are. I only
want you to shoot me.

27:14.508 --> 27:16.426
It's true!

27:16.760 --> 27:20.180
I have the worst b.O. Right now.
I'm so sorry.

27:20.264 --> 27:22.474
No,no,no.
But listen,

27:22.558 --> 27:23.517
let's all go out for
a drink sometime.

27:23.600 --> 27:24.643
Yeah.

27:24.726 --> 27:27.104
You know? Call me. Okay?

27:27.187 --> 27:28.188
Yeah. Okay.

27:28.272 --> 27:30.274
Listen, I'm under
Evelyn waugh.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.442
Oh, oh, oh.
Shh. Okay?

27:32.526 --> 27:34.027
Okay. Yeah.

27:34.111 --> 27:35.988
<i>Okay, arigato, arigato.</i>

27:39.449 --> 27:40.742
Evelyn waugh?

27:40.868 --> 27:42.786
What?
Evelyn waugh was a man.

27:43.162 --> 27:44.955
Oh, come on. She's nice.

27:46.290 --> 27:49.376
What? You know... you know,
not everybody went to Yale.

27:50.627 --> 27:53.130
It was just a pseudonym,
for Christ's sake.

27:53.213 --> 27:55.048
Why do you have
to defend her?

27:55.132 --> 27:58.135
Well, why do you have to point out how
stupid everybody is all the time?

27:58.218 --> 28:00.345
I thought it was funny.
Forget it.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.598
Well...

28:03.265 --> 28:04.725
Hey, John,
we gotta go.

28:04.808 --> 28:06.143
Oh. Yeah.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.145
Bye.

28:11.315 --> 28:14.151
<i>Did you ever wonder
what your purpose in life is?</i>

28:14.234 --> 28:17.738
<i>This book is about finding your
soul's purpose or destiny.</i>

28:17.821 --> 28:21.867
<i>Every soul has its path, but
sometimes that path is not clear.</i>

28:22.534 --> 28:24.411
<i>The inner map theory
is an example</i>

28:24.494 --> 28:26.496
<i>of how each soul
begins with an imprint,</i>

28:26.580 --> 28:30.042
<i>all compacted into a pattern that
has been selected by your soul</i>

28:30.125 --> 28:31.752
<i>before you've even
gotten here.</i>

28:36.715 --> 28:40.928
<i>You know, I guess the
reason why I like Japan the best</i>

28:41.011 --> 28:42.429
<i>out of all Asian countries,</i>

28:42.512 --> 28:46.892
<i>is because I really feel
close to buddhism.</i>

28:47.017 --> 28:48.185
<i>I really feel...</i>

28:49.978 --> 28:53.440
<i>That's part of what drew me
to midnight velocity as well,</i>

28:53.523 --> 28:56.443
<i>because although Keanu dies,</i>

28:56.526 --> 28:58.654
<i>he eventually gets
reincarnated.</i>

28:58.737 --> 29:02.282
<i>So there's hope. There's hope
in reincarnation, I think.</i>

29:02.616 --> 29:04.785
What was it like
working with Keanu Reeves?

29:04.868 --> 29:08.872
<i>He was always so... he was always,
you know, giving me ideas,</i>

29:08.956 --> 29:10.457
<i>and, you know, really helpful.</i>

29:10.540 --> 29:12.501
<i>He made me feel
really comfortable, so...</i>

29:12.584 --> 29:16.630
<i>And we both have two dogs,
and we both live in L.A.,</i>

29:16.713 --> 29:19.841
<i>so we have all these
different things in common.</i>

29:19.925 --> 29:22.761
<i>So, you know, we both
really like Mexican food,</i>

29:22.844 --> 29:25.764
<i>and yoga and</i>

29:25.847 --> 29:27.140
<i>karate!</i>

29:28.350 --> 29:31.061
<i>Mexican food. Yoga.</i>

29:49.162 --> 29:50.831
Hello. Hi.

29:54.918 --> 29:56.211
Okay.

30:05.053 --> 30:06.346
Okay.

30:10.309 --> 30:11.643
Okay.

30:17.733 --> 30:19.526
Okay.

30:19.609 --> 30:20.652
Okay.

31:33.475 --> 31:35.644
He got married
a couple of times

31:37.604 --> 31:38.730
to some nice women.

31:38.814 --> 31:41.942
Beautiful women, too. I mean, you and
i would be crazy for these women.

31:42.025 --> 31:44.194
But there were
always rumors.

31:45.362 --> 31:46.822
I never liked his acting,

31:46.905 --> 31:49.825
so I never gave a damn whether
he was straight or not.

31:49.908 --> 31:52.119
Thank you. Hi. Thanks.

31:52.702 --> 31:54.246
What can I get you?

31:55.705 --> 31:56.998
I'm not sure.

31:59.918 --> 32:02.379
For relaxing times,

32:02.462 --> 32:04.464
make it suntory time.

32:07.384 --> 32:08.677
I'll have a vodka tonic.

32:09.886 --> 32:11.221
Thanks.

32:16.643 --> 32:18.478
So, what are you
doing here?

32:20.105 --> 32:21.690
A couple of things.

32:22.065 --> 32:25.485
Taking a break from my wife,
forgetting my son's birthday

32:25.569 --> 32:28.238
and getting paid
$2 million

32:28.321 --> 32:30.407
to endorse a whisky

32:30.907 --> 32:33.243
when I could be doing
a play somewhere.

32:34.995 --> 32:36.163
Oh.

32:37.497 --> 32:39.916
But the good news is,
the whisky works.

32:47.382 --> 32:48.884
What are you doing?

32:51.261 --> 32:52.596
My husband's
a photographer,

32:52.679 --> 32:55.015
so he's here working,

32:55.682 --> 32:57.684
and I wasn't doing anything,
so I came along.

32:57.767 --> 33:00.187
And we have some friends
that live here.

33:00.812 --> 33:02.022
How long have you
been married?

33:02.105 --> 33:03.356
Thank you.

33:05.233 --> 33:06.443
Two years.

33:07.319 --> 33:08.945
Twenty-five long ones.

33:10.739 --> 33:13.366
You're probably just
having a midlife crisis.

33:14.367 --> 33:16.119
Did you buy a Porsche yet?

33:17.996 --> 33:20.749
You know, I was thinking
about buying a Porsche.

33:24.419 --> 33:27.130
Twenty-five years.
That's a...

33:27.964 --> 33:29.591
Well, it's impressive.

33:32.552 --> 33:35.931
Well, you figure you sleep
one-third of your life.

33:36.223 --> 33:38.391
That knocks off eight years
of marriage right there.

33:38.475 --> 33:40.894
So you're down
to 16 and change.

33:40.977 --> 33:43.021
You're just a teenager
at marriage.

33:43.104 --> 33:46.775
You can drive it, but there's
still the occasional accident.

33:46.858 --> 33:47.984
Yeah.

33:49.569 --> 33:50.862
What do you do?

33:55.367 --> 33:57.285
I'm not sure yet,
actually.

33:57.369 --> 33:59.287
I just graduated
last spring.

34:00.163 --> 34:01.665
What did you study?

34:01.831 --> 34:03.250
Phflosophy.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.002
Yeah, there's a good buck
in that racket.

34:06.086 --> 34:07.337
Yeah.

34:08.420 --> 34:11.299
Well, so far
it's pro bono.

34:13.342 --> 34:15.011
Well, I'm sure you'll
figure out the angles.

34:15.094 --> 34:16.221
Yeah.

34:18.848 --> 34:21.101
I hope your Porsche works out.

34:22.101 --> 34:23.311
Cheers to that, huh?

34:23.395 --> 34:24.603
Cheers to that.

34:36.574 --> 34:38.034
Wish I could sleep.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.369
Me, too.

34:48.878 --> 34:51.547
One, two, three,
and okay.

34:52.382 --> 34:53.675
All right.

35:02.058 --> 35:05.395
One, two, three, four.

35:05.729 --> 35:09.274
And one, two, three, four.

35:09.357 --> 35:11.359
And one, two...

36:24.974 --> 36:27.143
<i>Wait!
Take me with you!</i>

36:46.830 --> 36:47.997
How'd it go, huh?

36:48.081 --> 36:50.750
Oh, it was good, you know.
I'm tired.

36:50.834 --> 36:53.962
Yeah, I gotta go downstairs and
meet Kelly for some drinks.

36:54.045 --> 36:56.089
She wants to talk about
some photo thing.

36:56.172 --> 36:58.299
Maybe I'll go
downstairs with you.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.593
Oh, you wanna come?

37:00.677 --> 37:01.970
Yeah, sure.

37:02.387 --> 37:04.764
Okay. Yeah.

37:07.016 --> 37:09.185
You

37:09.269 --> 37:13.022
<i>stepped out of a dream</i>

37:13.314 --> 37:16.735
everybody is always like,
"Kelly, you are anorexic."

37:16.818 --> 37:18.319
And I'm like,
"no, I'm not."

37:18.403 --> 37:21.156
I eat so much junk food,
you wouldn't believe it.

37:21.239 --> 37:22.907
Just because I have
a high metabolism.

37:22.991 --> 37:24.909
Because I thought
you were anorexic, too.

37:24.993 --> 37:26.411
Everybody does.
Everybody thinks that.

37:26.494 --> 37:28.455
Yeah, 'cause
you look so...

37:28.538 --> 37:30.623
Thank you.
I know, but it's...

37:30.707 --> 37:33.460
I mean, I eat whatever. I have
a really high metabolism.

37:33.543 --> 37:35.128
Yeah.
But...

37:37.797 --> 37:39.924
My dad is an anorexic.

37:41.509 --> 37:43.470
- Really?
- Oh, really?

37:44.053 --> 37:45.096
Yeah.

37:45.180 --> 37:49.100
He fought on the American side
of the bay of pigs in Cuba.

37:49.684 --> 37:51.060
He was taken prisoner,

37:51.144 --> 37:54.522
and the whole time he was there
they tortured him about food.

37:54.606 --> 37:57.525
Every day they told him
they put poison in the food.

37:57.609 --> 38:00.820
So they would always make themselves
throw up after every meal.

38:00.904 --> 38:03.573
That's horrible.
That's terrible.

38:04.908 --> 38:06.284
That's some crazy shit.

38:06.409 --> 38:07.660
You don't think he sounds
kind of goofy? No.

38:07.744 --> 38:09.788
You know that
break beat, right?

38:10.330 --> 38:12.123
Well, I been taking it
to some next level shit.

38:12.207 --> 38:14.501
Like, I'll take that and put a
delay on it, so it's like...

38:17.670 --> 38:19.964
So it's, like,
evolving the beat.

38:20.048 --> 38:23.927
So it, like, sounds hella large on
the track. You know what I'm saying?

38:24.594 --> 38:26.012
No.
No?

38:26.095 --> 38:27.931
You don't listen
to hip-hop?

38:28.264 --> 38:30.433
Oh, my god!
You guys gotta listen.

38:30.892 --> 38:33.561
I tried this power cleanse.
It's so amazing.

38:33.645 --> 38:34.979
Okay, promise me
you'll try it.

38:35.063 --> 38:36.439
Will you try
this power cleanse?

38:36.564 --> 38:38.399
I did it last week, and it's amazing.
I'll be right back.

38:38.483 --> 38:41.528
It's so good to get the
toxins out of your body.

38:41.611 --> 38:44.781
With all, like, the
pollution, all,hke,theh.

38:49.452 --> 38:51.287
Hello.
Hello.

38:51.371 --> 38:53.122
You ever switch seats?

38:55.291 --> 38:58.294
I like this one. If I fall,
someone will notice.

38:59.546 --> 39:00.755
Yeah.

39:01.339 --> 39:03.174
So, you having a nice time?

39:03.800 --> 39:05.426
Can you keep a secret?

39:05.969 --> 39:07.887
I'm trying to organize
a prison break.

39:07.971 --> 39:09.931
I'm looking for, like,
an accomplice.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.644
We'd have to, first,
get out of this bar.

39:14.727 --> 39:18.398
Then the hotel, then the
city and then the country.

39:18.481 --> 39:20.316
Are you in,
or are you out?

39:20.400 --> 39:21.401
I'm in.

39:21.484 --> 39:23.403
Good.
I'll go pack my stuff.

39:23.486 --> 39:24.529
Get your coat.

39:24.612 --> 39:25.780
See you.

39:26.364 --> 39:29.200
I hope you've had enough to drink.
It's gonna take courage.

39:36.040 --> 39:39.419
Oh, look.
The label got me these.

39:39.836 --> 39:42.380
I love cristal.
You wanna have some?

39:43.047 --> 39:46.801
Well, I'm... I gotta go.
I mean, I...

39:49.679 --> 39:52.181
You know,
you don't have to stay.

39:52.265 --> 39:53.308
I mean...

39:53.391 --> 39:54.559
You don't have to go,
do you?

39:55.810 --> 39:57.604
Well, I...

39:57.687 --> 39:59.439
I know. You're gonna be
working the whole time.

39:59.522 --> 40:00.899
I'll have a much
better time here.

40:00.982 --> 40:01.983
I'll call Charlie
and those guys.

40:02.066 --> 40:04.027
Yeah! Call those guys.

40:04.819 --> 40:07.280
And I'm gonna be back
on Sunday, and I...

40:08.197 --> 40:09.866
I love you, you know.

40:13.119 --> 40:14.954
Okay?
I love you.

40:19.208 --> 40:20.460
I'll see you. Okay?

40:20.543 --> 40:22.879
Yeah, it's just gonna be a couple of...
A couple of days.

40:22.962 --> 40:24.005
Bye.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.298
I love you.

41:30.530 --> 41:31.823
Hello.

41:31.906 --> 41:33.116
Hello.
How are you?

41:33.199 --> 41:34.617
Good. How are you?

41:39.956 --> 41:41.124
It's a cool pool,
isn't it?

41:41.207 --> 41:42.625
Yeah, it's nice.

41:44.794 --> 41:46.421
Get any sleep?

41:46.504 --> 41:48.673
Not yet. How about you?

41:49.215 --> 41:51.134
No. Not yet.

41:52.427 --> 41:54.137
How long you staying for?

41:54.262 --> 41:56.556
I'll be in the bar for
the rest of the week.

41:58.641 --> 42:00.351
Well, that's good.

42:01.811 --> 42:05.106
I'm going out with some friends
later, if you wanna come...

42:06.149 --> 42:07.191
Sure.

42:07.275 --> 42:09.068
Okay. I'll see you later.

42:09.819 --> 42:11.279
Okay.
See you.

42:42.685 --> 42:44.062
Which one is burgundy?

42:46.189 --> 42:47.273
Hold on!

42:48.524 --> 42:49.734
Hold on.

42:53.946 --> 42:56.616
You really are having
a midlife crisis, huh?

42:56.699 --> 42:58.993
Really? Yeah,
i was afraid of that.

42:59.702 --> 43:04.082
I kept telling myself that I just wanted
to be ready in case we go to war tonight.

43:07.877 --> 43:10.004
My bathroom is
messier than yours.

43:15.301 --> 43:17.303
And it's not like
you're not trying.

43:17.386 --> 43:19.138
Here, will you cut
the tag out for me?

43:19.222 --> 43:20.348
Sure.

43:22.809 --> 43:24.185
You're too tall.

43:26.979 --> 43:28.981
Anybody ever tell you,
you may be too small?

43:30.191 --> 43:31.150
Whose is this?

43:31.234 --> 43:34.153
<i>"A soul's search:
Finding your true calling."</i>

43:34.237 --> 43:35.488
I don't know.

43:36.739 --> 43:37.698
I have that.

43:37.782 --> 43:39.659
Did it work out
for you, then?

43:41.536 --> 43:42.870
Obviously.

43:44.288 --> 43:45.414
Okay.

43:45.915 --> 43:47.208
Okay.

43:48.918 --> 43:50.211
Where's your shoes?

43:50.294 --> 43:51.337
They're over here.

43:51.420 --> 43:52.547
Where's your room key?

43:52.630 --> 43:53.756
It's in my bag.

43:54.340 --> 43:55.383
And where's your bag?

43:55.466 --> 43:56.717
It's right here.

43:57.218 --> 43:58.344
Let's go.
Wait!

43:58.427 --> 43:59.470
There's the elevator.
I gotta go.

43:59.554 --> 44:00.638
Hey!

44:04.100 --> 44:05.601

44:14.694 --> 44:16.237
This is bambie.
How are you, bambie?

44:16.320 --> 44:17.446
His real name's
hayashi, but...

44:17.530 --> 44:19.031
Why do they call you
Charlie brown?

44:19.115 --> 44:21.868
Everybody say, "helookshke
Charlie brown."

44:21.951 --> 44:23.327
You know, snoopy, man.

44:23.411 --> 44:25.663
Oh, I'll be right back.

Oh! Bob.

44:36.549 --> 44:38.801
Bob from United States,
man.

44:40.094 --> 44:41.512
Hi, Bob.

44:41.596 --> 44:43.222
Maybe you'd like to
sing backup for me.

44:43.306 --> 44:44.682
This is my
surfing teacher.

44:44.765 --> 44:45.892
He's your
surfing teacher?

44:45.975 --> 44:47.852
Sometime, sometime.

44:47.935 --> 44:48.978
You're a surfer?

45:25.765 --> 45:27.558
The emperor's house? Cool.

45:31.062 --> 45:32.688
Yeah?

45:36.484 --> 45:38.152
Cool!

45:38.236 --> 45:39.278

45:39.362 --> 45:41.781
You don't have anything...
Do you have anything...

45:41.864 --> 45:42.865

Hi.

47:36.729 --> 47:38.981
Last weekend,
i went surfing.

47:39.065 --> 47:40.066
Right.

47:40.149 --> 47:43.736
About seven people, you know.
Some friends.

47:43.819 --> 47:47.573
And we camp over
there on the beach.

47:49.075 --> 47:52.078
In fact, we made a kind of...

47:52.161 --> 47:54.080
Wait. What kind
of weed is it?

47:54.163 --> 47:55.581
I don't know.

47:55.664 --> 47:59.710
<i>Baby when I saw you turnin'
at the end of the street</i>

48:02.004 --> 48:03.589
<i>I knew our time was gone</i>

48:03.672 --> 48:07.176
<i>into blank pages</i>

48:07.259 --> 48:12.306
<i>just understand I was afraid
to be a simple guy</i>

48:12.390 --> 48:14.975
<i>I tried my best to smile</i>

48:15.059 --> 48:17.645
<i>but deep inside my heart</i>

48:17.728 --> 48:20.773
<i>I felt like the shell
that a crab comes in</i>

48:21.273 --> 48:23.818
<i>I guess I couldn't
live without things</i>

48:23.901 --> 48:24.067

Oh, Jesus.

50:43.374 --> 50:47.545

Hey, you know,
those carpet samples,

55:28.700 --> 55:30.244
you were right
about the burgundy.

55:30.327 --> 55:32.037
It wasn't even close.

55:32.120 --> 55:33.622
Blows the others away.

55:33.705 --> 55:35.874
<i>I'm glad you like it.</i>

55:37.292 --> 55:41.505
I saw a great house tonight
that you would've loved,

55:41.964 --> 55:44.341
and that burgundy would've been
good in this house, really.

55:44.424 --> 55:45.551
<i>Really?</i>

55:45.634 --> 55:48.136
A guy designed his
own house and built it.

55:48.262 --> 55:50.681
<i>Oh, yeah? I wish I'd seen it.</i>

55:52.641 --> 55:55.978
He's a fashion guy. All these
fashion people were there.

55:56.854 --> 55:59.940
And there were
Japanese surfers there,

56:00.023 --> 56:04.778
and the guy was playing really,
really, really great music.

56:04.862 --> 56:07.239
I shoulcfve found out what
it was and brought some...

56:07.322 --> 56:09.741
I'll bring some back.
I'll try to find out.

56:09.825 --> 56:12.077
<i>That sounds great.
Can you hold on?</i>

56:14.621 --> 56:18.333
<i>You have to have something for breakfast.
Do you want some cereal?</i>

56:18.417 --> 56:20.252
Tell her I said
she's gotta eat something.

56:20.335 --> 56:22.629
<i>I'm just trying to get her
to eat something.</i>

56:22.713 --> 56:25.257
Yeah. Tell her I said
she has to eat something.

56:25.340 --> 56:27.175
<i>Your dad says
eat something.</i>

56:27.259 --> 56:28.260
<i>No.</i>

56:28.343 --> 56:30.512
Eat. Tell her I said so.

56:30.596 --> 56:32.848
<i>She won't eat anything.
Forget it.</i>

56:33.348 --> 56:35.434
<i>Look, I'm glad
you're having fun.</i>

56:36.518 --> 56:39.938
It's not fun. It's just... it's
just very, very different.

56:40.480 --> 56:42.065
<i>Maybe that's good.</i>

56:43.358 --> 56:45.903
<i>I have to get the kids off
for school, okay?</i>

56:45.986 --> 56:47.905
<i>So, can I call you in a while?</i>

56:49.239 --> 56:52.326
I might not be up.
It's... it's, like, 4:00.

56:53.702 --> 56:56.705
<i>Well, you better get some sleep.
You have work in the morning.</i>

56:56.788 --> 56:59.207
No, actually,
they gave me tomorrow off.

56:59.917 --> 57:01.752
<i>That must be nice.</i>

57:04.838 --> 57:07.716
<i>All right. Well, thanks
for checking in. I gotta go.</i>

57:08.133 --> 57:09.509
All right. Have a great,
great night.

57:09.593 --> 57:10.636
<i>All right.</i>

57:10.719 --> 57:13.221
I mean, I guess have
a great morning, huh?

57:13.889 --> 57:15.390
<i>Good night, Bob. Good night.</i>

57:15.474 --> 57:16.558
Good night.

57:18.727 --> 57:19.937
I love you.

57:22.606 --> 57:24.316
That was a stupid idea.

58:36.722 --> 58:38.223
I was feeling tight, you know?
Mmm-hmm.

58:38.306 --> 58:40.142
Shoulders and neck.
Mmm-hmm.

58:40.308 --> 58:42.894
So I called down
and had a

58:44.146 --> 58:45.564
shiatsu massage
in my room.

58:45.647 --> 58:46.857
That's nice.

58:46.940 --> 58:50.152
And the tightness has
completely disappeared

58:50.569 --> 58:52.404
and been replaced by

58:53.613 --> 58:55.240
unbelievable pain.

58:56.116 --> 58:58.285
Just staggering,
unbearable pain.

58:58.368 --> 58:59.619
That's too bad.

58:59.703 --> 59:01.163
Yeah.
I'm in pain.

59:01.246 --> 59:06.043
I got my foot banged up, and...
Wanna see it?

59:07.085 --> 59:08.712
How do you say no?

59:08.795 --> 59:09.921
Oh, my gosh!

59:10.005 --> 59:11.006
I know.

59:11.089 --> 59:12.090
Thafsâ€œ.

59:12.340 --> 59:13.592
How...
When did you do this?

59:13.675 --> 59:16.011
I did it the other day.
It hurts, you know?

59:16.094 --> 59:17.888
Didn't you feel
any pain? Your...

59:17.971 --> 59:19.598
Yeah, it really hurt.
It was...

59:19.681 --> 59:21.516
Yeah. That toe
is almost dead.

59:22.726 --> 59:24.102
I think I gotta take you
to a doctor.

59:24.186 --> 59:26.313
You can't just put that
back in the shoe.

59:26.396 --> 59:28.106
No. I don't think so.

59:28.190 --> 59:30.692
Well, you either go to a
doctor, or you leave it here.

59:33.278 --> 59:35.363
He's smiling.
You like that idea?

59:35.697 --> 59:38.158
See, they love black toe
over in this country.

59:38.241 --> 59:40.160
You got a sharp knife?

59:40.452 --> 59:42.245
Gotta be, you know,
in this country,

59:42.329 --> 59:44.039
somebody's gotta
prefer a black toe.

59:45.415 --> 59:46.708
"Brack toe."

59:46.792 --> 59:50.045
Or we should probably hang
around until someone orders it.

59:50.629 --> 59:52.130
Hey, what's with
the straight face?

59:52.714 --> 59:54.299
Hospital regulations.
Get in there.

59:54.382 --> 59:55.383
All right.
Thank you.

59:55.467 --> 59:56.468
All right.

59:59.721 --> 01:00:02.265
Careful, okay?
No, don't!

01:00:02.808 --> 01:00:04.851
No!
Hey, use the horn, fella.

01:00:10.816 --> 01:00:12.609
Let's try "mixed internal."

01:00:12.901 --> 01:00:14.277
Yeah. Go.

01:00:14.361 --> 01:00:15.362
Switched to beer, huh?

01:00:15.904 --> 01:00:17.656
Go. Go. You might want
to switch to sake.

01:00:17.739 --> 01:00:18.990
Stop.

01:00:22.077 --> 01:00:23.120
Hi.

01:00:23.745 --> 01:00:24.830
Hi.
Hi.

01:00:26.039 --> 01:00:28.333
Yeah. We need a doctor.

01:00:28.416 --> 01:00:30.627
For a hurt... emergency room.

01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:33.505
It's not an emergency.
I just hurt my foot.

01:00:40.512 --> 01:00:43.515
Okay, do we fill this out?
We go over there?

01:00:43.598 --> 01:00:44.975
Which number?

01:00:51.439 --> 01:00:54.192
We're not going to another hospital,
so whatever you say is okay.

01:00:54.276 --> 01:00:55.443
Okay.

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:58.572
Could you put that back
in the garage for us?

01:01:33.148 --> 01:01:34.482
"Ln desuka"?

01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:46.286
Japan.

01:01:47.245 --> 01:01:48.371
Japan.

01:01:51.291 --> 01:01:52.292
Japanâ€œ.

01:01:52.918 --> 01:01:53.919
After?

01:01:55.003 --> 01:01:56.004
Japanâ€œ.

01:02:06.264 --> 01:02:10.185
Ahh-ah, so. Ahh-ah.

01:02:11.186 --> 01:02:14.064
Ahh, so. Ahh...

01:02:16.441 --> 01:02:20.278
Ahh, so. Ahh...

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:23.073
How's that song go?

01:02:35.877 --> 01:02:37.254
Ls that for me?

01:02:38.505 --> 01:02:39.881
Yeah, it can be for you.

01:03:13.581 --> 01:03:15.333
<i>Hey, Bob, it's Charlotte.</i>

01:03:15.417 --> 01:03:19.754
<i>I'm going to meet Charlie and those guys
at this place called orange around 10:00,</i>

01:03:19.838 --> 01:03:22.590
<i>so I'll fax you a map
on how to get there.</i>

01:03:22.674 --> 01:03:25.093
<i>I hope you can come
and meet us. Bye.</i>

01:03:34.185 --> 01:03:36.771
<i>Suckin' on my titties

01:03:36.855 --> 01:03:38.648

01:03:44.195 --> 01:03:46.990
<i>what else is in the
teaches of peaches?</i>

01:03:47.073 --> 01:03:48.950
<i>Huh, what?</i>

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:58.710
<i>Suckin' on my titties
like you wanted me</i>

01:03:58.793 --> 01:04:01.421
<i>callin' me all the time
like blondie</i>

01:04:01.504 --> 01:04:03.965
how long have
you been here?

01:04:04.049 --> 01:04:05.300
I couldn't say.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.802
Where's Charlie
and those guys?

01:04:09.637 --> 01:04:11.556
They're taking
a dance class.

01:04:12.557 --> 01:04:16.102
<i>Why, what?</i>

01:04:16.269 --> 01:04:19.731
<i>Uh-huh</i>

01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:23.485
<i>what? Right</i>

01:04:23.610 --> 01:04:25.528
<i>oh</i>

01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:30.825
can I get you
a couple drinks?

01:04:30.909 --> 01:04:31.993
Let's go.

01:04:32.077 --> 01:04:33.411
Okay. Okay

01:04:33.912 --> 01:04:34.954
<i>like you wanted me</i>

01:04:35.038 --> 01:04:36.164
thank you.

01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:37.624
<i>Callin' me all the time
like blondie</i>

01:04:40.835 --> 01:04:42.212
he's got blockers.

01:04:43.671 --> 01:04:45.382
They've got room to run.

01:04:45.673 --> 01:04:48.093
He's cutting back.
He cut back.

01:04:48.176 --> 01:04:50.637
He's dancing. He's dancing.
Where'd he go?

01:04:53.890 --> 01:04:55.141
There you are.

01:04:58.395 --> 01:04:59.562
Say "hi."

01:05:03.691 --> 01:05:05.652
Hi. You ready?

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:08.029
Come on.

01:05:10.698 --> 01:05:12.534
<i>Thank you, Tokyo!</i>

01:05:12.617 --> 01:05:17.455
Nobody does it better

01:05:19.582 --> 01:05:24.337
<i>makes me feel sad
for the rest</i>

01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:29.968
<i>nobody does it</i>

01:05:30.051 --> 01:05:32.679
<i>half as good as you</i>

01:05:34.055 --> 01:05:37.684
<i>baby, you're the best</i>

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.894
you two. Both of you.

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:44.357
<i>I wasn't lookin'</i>

01:05:45.233 --> 01:05:48.111
<i>but somehow you found me</i>

01:05:50.238 --> 01:05:54.325
<i>I tried to hide
from your love, yeah</i>

01:07:26.834 --> 01:07:28.169
<i>no, no. Not here.</i>

01:07:28.836 --> 01:07:30.296
<i>It must be over there.</i>

01:07:46.229 --> 01:07:47.605
You know,
the first time I saw you,

01:07:47.689 --> 01:07:50.191
you were wearing
a tuxedo at the bar.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.026
You were very dashing.

01:07:52.527 --> 01:07:54.028
I liked the mascara.

01:08:00.535 --> 01:08:03.121
But the first time I saw you
was in the elevator.

01:08:03.204 --> 01:08:04.289
Really?

01:08:04.372 --> 01:08:05.456
You don't remember?

01:08:09.002 --> 01:08:11.254
I guess you do
kind of blend in, huh?

01:08:13.631 --> 01:08:15.174
Did I scowl at you?

01:08:16.134 --> 01:08:17.635
No, you smiled.

01:08:17.719 --> 01:08:18.761
I did?

01:08:18.845 --> 01:08:20.470
Yes, it was a complete
accident.

01:08:20.555 --> 01:08:22.140
A freak.
I haven't seen it since.

01:08:22.223 --> 01:08:25.018
Just that one time.
Like that, but bigger.

01:08:26.685 --> 01:08:29.272
Bigger. Yeah, big, big...

01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:31.274
Well, not that big.

01:08:32.399 --> 01:08:34.152
<i>My goodness.</i>

01:08:40.908 --> 01:08:44.578
<i>Marcello, come here.
Hurry up.</i>

01:08:48.416 --> 01:08:51.085
Why do they switch
the "r's" and the "l's" here?

01:08:52.211 --> 01:08:54.714
Oh, for yuks.
You know, just to mix it up.

01:08:56.256 --> 01:08:59.135
They have to amuse themselves,
'cause we're not making them laugh.

01:09:02.764 --> 01:09:06.893
Let's never come here again, 'cause
it would never be as much fun.

01:09:09.937 --> 01:09:12.189
Whatever you say.
You're the boss.

01:09:17.528 --> 01:09:18.779
I'm stuck.

01:09:22.617 --> 01:09:24.077
Does it get easier?

01:09:24.786 --> 01:09:25.828
No.

01:09:27.955 --> 01:09:29.207
Yes.

01:09:30.291 --> 01:09:31.584
It gets easier.

01:09:32.669 --> 01:09:33.920
Oh, yeah?

01:09:34.462 --> 01:09:35.712
Look at you.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:38.800
Thanks.

01:09:40.968 --> 01:09:43.136
The more you know
who you are,

01:09:43.220 --> 01:09:44.805
and what you want,

01:09:45.473 --> 01:09:47.600
the less you let

01:09:48.393 --> 01:09:49.769
things upset you.

01:09:51.562 --> 01:09:52.814
Yeah.

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:57.068
I just don't know
what I'm supposed to be.

01:09:57.944 --> 01:09:59.237
You know?

01:10:00.071 --> 01:10:02.323
I tried being a writer,
but...

01:10:02.824 --> 01:10:04.242
I hate what I write.

01:10:04.325 --> 01:10:08.162
And I tried
taking pictures,

01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:11.541
but they're so mediocre,
you know.

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:14.752
Every girl goes through
a photography phase.

01:10:15.503 --> 01:10:17.088
You know, like horses?

01:10:18.089 --> 01:10:22.343
You know? Take dumb
pictures of your feet.

01:10:24.721 --> 01:10:26.347
You'll figure that out.

01:10:27.932 --> 01:10:29.684
I'm not worried
about you.

01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:34.480
Keep writing.

01:10:39.861 --> 01:10:41.487
But I'm so mean.

01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:45.324
Mean's okay.
Yeah?

01:10:52.498 --> 01:10:54.959
What about marriage?
Does that get easier?

01:11:02.175 --> 01:11:03.426
That's hard.

01:11:09.390 --> 01:11:11.267
We used to have
a lot of fun.

01:11:12.852 --> 01:11:16.063
Lydia would come with me
when I made the movies,

01:11:16.147 --> 01:11:18.816
and we would laugh
about it all.

01:11:21.027 --> 01:11:24.572
Now she doesn't want to leave
the kids, and she doesn't

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:29.744
need me to be there.

01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:33.039
The kids miss me,
but they're fine.

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:39.545
It gets a whole lot more
complicated when you have kids.

01:11:39.962 --> 01:11:41.756
Yeah. It's scary.

01:11:45.426 --> 01:11:47.178
It's the most terrifying
day of your life

01:11:47.261 --> 01:11:49.388
the day the first one is born.

01:11:50.014 --> 01:11:52.558
Yeah. Nobody ever
tells you that.

01:11:54.018 --> 01:11:55.478
Your life,

01:11:56.354 --> 01:11:57.647
as you know it,

01:11:58.105 --> 01:11:59.440
is gone.

01:12:00.942 --> 01:12:02.276
Never to return.

01:12:04.946 --> 01:12:08.366
But they learn how to walk, and
they learn how to talk, and...

01:12:09.283 --> 01:12:12.245
And you want to be with them.

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:15.706
And they turn out
to be the most

01:12:15.790 --> 01:12:18.042
delightful people

01:12:18.125 --> 01:12:20.002
you will ever meet
in your life.

01:12:20.086 --> 01:12:22.338
Hmm, that's nice.

01:12:36.269 --> 01:12:37.770
Where'd you gr0w up?

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:40.815
I grew up in New York,

01:12:41.774 --> 01:12:45.111
and I moved to Los Angeles
when John and I got married.

01:12:46.153 --> 01:12:47.989
But it's so different there.

01:12:48.656 --> 01:12:50.324
Yeah, I know.

01:12:52.660 --> 01:12:54.829
John thinks
I'm so snotty.

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:16.934
You're not hopeless.

01:16:42.681 --> 01:16:43.766
Hello?

01:16:44.433 --> 01:16:45.434
<i>Mr. Harris?
A fax for you.</i>

01:16:45.518 --> 01:16:46.852
Yes.

01:16:46.977 --> 01:16:49.313
Okay. Can you send it up?

01:16:49.396 --> 01:16:50.940
Do you think you could
kick it under the door for me,

01:16:51.023 --> 01:16:52.817
slide it under the door
for me, please?

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:54.485
<i>Do you want I send it
to your room?</i>

01:16:54.568 --> 01:16:56.987
Just slide it under the door,
please. Thank you.

01:16:57.071 --> 01:16:58.239
<i>Okay. Thank you,
Mr. Harris.</i>

01:16:58.322 --> 01:16:59.323
All right, bye.

01:17:34.900 --> 01:17:38.112
Hey, Ms. kawasaki.
It's Bob Harris.

01:17:38.779 --> 01:17:42.199
Yes, I would love to
do his talk show.

01:17:42.408 --> 01:17:43.576
L would.

01:17:44.910 --> 01:17:47.288
I would love to change
my plans and stay.

01:18:04.930 --> 01:18:06.640
...American movie star...

01:18:13.439 --> 01:18:15.566
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:18:15.649 --> 01:18:18.819
Mr. Bob Harris!

01:18:18.903 --> 01:18:20.112
Come on!

01:18:24.575 --> 01:18:26.202
Whoo!

01:18:26.285 --> 01:18:28.037
Come on, Bob.
Come on, Bob.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.497
Bobby, come on!
Bobby, come on!

01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:33.334
Nice to meet you.

01:18:37.254 --> 01:18:39.673
He said you guys
are e-mailing together.

01:18:46.931 --> 01:18:48.766
He wants to show you
his dance.

01:18:48.849 --> 01:18:49.808
Japanese dance step.

01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:51.268
Japanese dance.

01:18:51.352 --> 01:18:52.937
Do I... do I have
to dance with him?

01:18:58.150 --> 01:19:01.195
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby,
Bobby... Bobby.

01:19:02.529 --> 01:19:03.948
Welcome, Bob.
What?

01:19:04.031 --> 01:19:05.407
He was saying,
"welcome, Bob."

01:19:45.239 --> 01:19:47.199
<i>- Hello?
- Bob?</i>

01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:50.577
Hi, Lydia.

01:19:50.869 --> 01:19:52.454
<i>Is this a bad time?</i>

01:19:53.497 --> 01:19:55.332
No, it's always a good time.

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:59.169
<i>Look, your burgundy carpet
isn't in stock.</i>

01:19:59.253 --> 01:20:03.132
<i>It's gonna take 12 weeks. Did you
like any of the other colors?</i>

01:20:06.552 --> 01:20:09.263
Whatever you like.
I'm completely lost.

01:20:10.597 --> 01:20:12.266
<i>It's just carpet.</i>

01:20:13.434 --> 01:20:15.019
That's not what
I'm talking about.

01:20:15.102 --> 01:20:17.229
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

01:20:19.732 --> 01:20:22.192
I don't know.
I just want to get healthy.

01:20:22.276 --> 01:20:25.279
You know, I want to take
better care of myself.

01:20:25.362 --> 01:20:28.365
I would like to start
eating healthier.

01:20:28.532 --> 01:20:30.743
I don't want all that pasta.

01:20:30.826 --> 01:20:31.994
<i>What?</i>

01:20:32.494 --> 01:20:35.331
I would like to start eating,
like, Japanese food.

01:20:36.707 --> 01:20:40.377
<i>Well, why don't you just stay there,
and you can have it every day?</i>

01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:47.009
How are the kids doing?

01:20:48.010 --> 01:20:50.637
<i>They're fine.
They miss their father.</i>

01:20:50.804 --> 01:20:53.849
<i>But they're getting used
to you not being here.</i>

01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:56.352
<i>Do I need to worry
about you, Bob?</i>

01:20:57.936 --> 01:20:59.813
Only if you want to.

01:21:01.315 --> 01:21:05.235
<i>Bob, I got things to do.
I gotta go.</i>

01:21:05.944 --> 01:21:07.071
Okay.

01:21:08.155 --> 01:21:10.491
<i>I'll see you... l mean,
I'll talk to you later.</i>

01:21:10.574 --> 01:21:11.867
Okay.

01:21:12.409 --> 01:21:13.869
<i>Okay, bye-</i>

01:21:14.411 --> 01:21:15.662

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:58.705
We have Matthew smellick!

01:21:59.123 --> 01:22:02.000

01:22:09.341 --> 01:22:10.801
Thank you.
Thank you so much.

01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:12.010
We'll take a really
short break,

01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:13.637
and we'll see you
in a minute.

01:22:20.602 --> 01:22:22.938
Hi. Champagne. Thanks.

01:23:20.287 --> 01:23:23.040
I'm going to that place, that
Sushi place in daikanyama.

01:23:23.123 --> 01:23:24.333
You wanna come?

01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:25.834
Yeah, but I can't

Oh, I'm...
I couldn't hear you.

<i>Do you want to talk to Zoe?</i>

01:23:57.574 --> 01:23:58.700
Yeah.

<i>Zoe, come say hello

<i>She just ran into

01:24:31.692 --> 01:24:33.694
Well, she is closer
to your age.

01:24:36.530 --> 01:24:39.700
You could talk about things
you have in common, like

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:42.703
growing up in the '50s.

01:24:43.787 --> 01:24:46.248
Maybe she liked the movies
you were making in the '70s,

01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:48.458
when you still
were making movies.

01:24:49.042 --> 01:24:51.962
Wasn't there anyone else there
to lavish you with attention?

01:25:01.013 --> 01:25:03.056
I'm switching to beer.
Okay?

01:25:08.562 --> 01:25:10.397
I can't tell
the difference.

01:25:15.986 --> 01:25:17.613

<i>Await instructions

01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:44.825
That was the worst lunch.

01:26:44.908 --> 01:26:46.118
So bad.

01:26:47.244 --> 01:26:50.205
What kind of restaurant makes
you cook your own food?

01:26:57.295 --> 01:26:58.839
When are you leaving?

01:27:01.591 --> 01:27:02.801
Tomorrow.

01:27:07.514 --> 01:27:08.849
I'll miss you.

01:28:03.612 --> 01:28:05.781
So don't. Stay here with me.

01:28:07.824 --> 01:28:09.534
We'll start a jazz band.

01:28:14.706 --> 01:28:18.418
<i>I am so into you, baby</i>

01:28:39.731 --> 01:28:41.691

I'll be one minute.

01:29:48.717 --> 01:29:52.262
Charlotte, I'm down in the
lobby, and I'm leaving now.

01:29:53.638 --> 01:29:54.973
L was calling

01:29:55.056 --> 01:29:57.475
to see if you still
have my jacket.

01:29:57.559 --> 01:29:59.561
If you could bring it down,
but you're not there,

01:29:59.644 --> 01:30:03.148
so this is goodbye, and...

01:30:05.609 --> 01:30:07.068
