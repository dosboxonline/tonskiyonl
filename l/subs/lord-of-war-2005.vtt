01:12.489 --> 01:16.700
There are over 550 million firearms
in worldwide circulation.

01:17.368 --> 01:20.788
That's one firearm
for every 12 people on the planet.

01:21.414 --> 01:22.998
The only question is,

01:26.002 --> 01:27.836
how do we arm the other 11?

04:35.984 --> 04:37.901
You don't have to worry.

04:37.986 --> 04:41.196
I'm not gonna tell you a pack of lies
to make me look good.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.782
I'm just gonna tell you what happened.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.784
My name is Yuri Orlov.

04:45.868 --> 04:48.996
When I was a boy,
my family came to America,

04:49.038 --> 04:50.998
but not all the way.

04:51.040 --> 04:54.710
Like most Ukrainians,
we congregated in Brighton Beach.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.212
It reminded us of the Black Sea.

04:57.255 --> 05:00.424
I soon realized we'd just swapped
one hell for another.

05:01.384 --> 05:05.178
Even in hell,
an angel sometimes makes an appearance.

05:05.847 --> 05:09.558
I'd worshipped Ava Fontaine
since I was 10 years old.

05:09.600 --> 05:12.144
Of course, she didn't know I existed.

05:13.313 --> 05:15.731
I was starting to think she had a point.

05:19.193 --> 05:21.486
For the first 20-odd years of my life,

05:21.571 --> 05:24.781
Little Odessa was to me
what it is to the Q train.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.825
The end of the line.

05:28.953 --> 05:31.288
Oh, I did lie about my name.

05:31.372 --> 05:33.457
It's not really Yuri Orlov.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.751
There have been few occasions
in the 20th century

05:35.835 --> 05:38.295
when it's been an advantage to be a Jew.

05:38.379 --> 05:43.050
But in the '70s, to escape the Soviet Union
our family pretended to be Jewish.

05:43.092 --> 05:46.053
Little about my life
has been kosher ever since.

05:46.095 --> 05:49.639
- How's it going, brother?
- It's not.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.933
That's Vitaly, my younger brother.

05:51.976 --> 05:54.644
He was as lost as me.
He just didn't know it yet.

05:54.515 --> 05:55.944
Yuri, Where have you been?

05:54.729 --> 05:56.938
Yuri, kouda prava, you're late.

05:55.984 --> 05:57.042
You're late.

06:01.069 --> 06:03.904
My father took his assumed identity
to heart.

06:04.155 --> 06:08.742
He was more Jewish than most Jews,
which drove my Catholic mother crazy.

06:08.785 --> 06:11.453
How many times? I can't eat shellfish.

06:12.497 --> 06:14.539
- It's trayf. • <i>unfit to be eaten</i> •
- You're not Jewish.

06:14.624 --> 06:15.999
I like it.

06:16.834 --> 06:18.710
I like the hat.

06:18.920 --> 06:21.880
To remind us there is something above us.

06:23.341 --> 06:24.633
I like that.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.679
- I'm going to temple.
- You're not going to temple.

06:29.764 --> 06:31.932
You go to temple more than the rabbi.

06:32.548 --> 06:33.836
Get off my back, woman.

06:33.876 --> 06:36.036
God, will you ever wise up?

06:35.853 --> 06:39.815
Yuri, don't forget to check the specials
at the Palace.

06:41.734 --> 06:45.654
Growing up in Little Odessa,
murder was an everyday part of life.

06:45.863 --> 06:49.074
Russian mobsters had also migrated
from the Soviet Union.

06:49.200 --> 06:52.536
And when they came to America,
their baggage came with them.

06:54.831 --> 06:57.749
There was always some gangster
getting whacked in my neighborhood,

06:57.834 --> 06:59.876
but I'd never seen it with my own eyes.

06:59.961 --> 07:03.380
I had this knack of showing up
five minutes before something went down,

07:03.464 --> 07:04.965
or five minutes after.

07:05.007 --> 07:06.299
Not that day.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.033
It hit me.

07:32.118 --> 07:35.328
It couldn't have hit me harder
if I was the one who'd been shot.

07:35.705 --> 07:37.289
You go into the restaurant business

07:37.373 --> 07:40.417
because people are always
going to have to eat.

07:40.793 --> 07:45.714
That was the day I realized my destiny lay
in fulfilling another basic human need.

07:49.135 --> 07:52.053
The next Sabbath,
I went to temple with my father.

07:52.096 --> 07:55.557
However, it wasn't God
I was trying to get close to.

07:55.600 --> 07:57.809
Eli, my oldest son Yuri.

07:57.894 --> 08:02.522
My contact at synagogue landed me
my first Israeli-made Uzi submachine guns.

08:07.570 --> 08:10.822
The first time you sell a gun
is a lot like the first time you have sex.

08:10.907 --> 08:14.618
You have absolutely no idea
what you're doing, but it is exciting,

08:14.702 --> 08:17.996
and one way or another,
it's over way too fast.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.920
Gentlemen, the new Uzi machine pistol,

08:24.962 --> 08:26.755
big firepower in a small package.

08:26.839 --> 08:30.926
This little baby uses 9mm hollowpoints,
20, 25-round extendable mags,

08:31.010 --> 08:32.594
rear-flip adjustable sights.

08:32.636 --> 08:34.679
Silencer comes standard.
Excellent recoil reduction.

08:34.764 --> 08:38.099
Muzzle jump reduced 40%,
60% improved noise suppression.

08:38.142 --> 08:40.894
You could pump a mag into me right now

08:41.270 --> 08:43.772
and never wake the guy in the next room.

08:44.941 --> 08:48.026
Of course, that would eliminate
your opportunity for repeat business.

08:49.779 --> 08:53.156
I did have a natural instinct
for smuggling contraband.

08:53.282 --> 08:57.619
Fortunately, back then a video camera
was as big as a bazooka.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.963
Here, I'd been running away from violence
my whole life,

09:08.005 --> 09:10.507
and I should have been running toward it.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.551
It's in our nature.

09:12.635 --> 09:16.471
The earliest human skeletons
had spearheads in their ribcages.

09:28.150 --> 09:31.486
Where have you been?
What if we had a customer?

09:31.529 --> 09:33.488
God bless America.

09:48.546 --> 09:49.671
Yeah?

09:56.012 --> 09:57.721
"Beware of the dog"?

09:57.805 --> 09:59.848
You don't have a dog.
Are you trying to scare people?

09:59.890 --> 10:01.558
No, it's to scare me.

10:01.767 --> 10:04.144
Remind me to beware of the dog in me.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.855
The dog that wants
to fuck everything that moves,

10:06.897 --> 10:08.648
wants to fight and kill weaker dogs.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.901
I guess it's to remind me
to be more human.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.195
Isn't being a dog part of being human?

10:14.822 --> 10:18.033
What if that's the best part of you,
the dog part?

10:18.826 --> 10:21.369
What if you're really
just a two-legged dog?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.582
You need to see somebody.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.334
It stinks in here.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.420
I'd always wanted to do something big
with my life.

10:30.504 --> 10:32.422
I just didn't know what.

10:32.673 --> 10:35.759
Anyhow, I figured if I was going
into the gun trade,

10:35.843 --> 10:37.677
I was going to aim high.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.555
Vitaly, stop fucking around.
I want to talk to you.

10:44.393 --> 10:46.227
You read the newspapers, V?

10:46.270 --> 10:49.731
The newspaper? It's always the same.

10:49.815 --> 10:53.068
You're right. Every day
there's people shooting each other.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.236
You know what I do when I see that?

10:55.279 --> 10:59.074
I look to see what guns they're using,
and I think to myself, "Why not my guns?"

10:59.116 --> 11:00.408
What, you opening a gun shop?

11:00.451 --> 11:03.244
Already more of those
in America than McDonald's.

11:03.287 --> 11:07.123
Even with all the gangsters around here,
the margins are too low.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.417
- You've worked out the margins?
- Sure.

11:10.586 --> 11:12.212
Forget gang wars.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.924
The real money's in actual wars
between countries.

11:16.342 --> 11:19.511
Yuri, what the fuck
do you know about guns?

11:19.845 --> 11:22.222
I know which end I'd rather be on.

11:24.183 --> 11:27.686
I made the first sale.
We're already in business.

11:29.355 --> 11:32.107
Whoa. We?

11:32.191 --> 11:33.566
I need a partner.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.949
I don't know.
I don't know, Yuri. I don't know.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.910
Vitaly, I've tasted your borscht.
You're no fucking chef.

11:43.953 --> 11:47.038
I can eat in the restaurant for free
and I still don't eat there.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.289
Fuck you.

11:48.499 --> 11:50.291
We're doing nothing with our lives.

11:52.545 --> 11:56.798
I mean, this is shit. This is shit.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.426
That's true.

12:01.095 --> 12:03.888
But maybe doing nothing's better
than doing this.

12:07.476 --> 12:08.810
I need you.

12:09.813 --> 12:11.801
Brothers In Arms.

12:17.184 --> 12:18.972
Brothers In Arms.

12:32.501 --> 12:33.626
Sir, sir,

12:33.669 --> 12:37.881
may I interest you in the shoulder-fired
SA-7 surface-to-air missile?

12:37.965 --> 12:39.299
It's the older Chinese model.

12:39.341 --> 12:41.676
Not so effective
against modern military aircraft,

12:41.761 --> 12:44.471
but deadly if used
against a commercial airliner.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.681
I'm giving them away at $850.

12:48.017 --> 12:51.436
It was the '80s, and the Cold War
was far from thawed.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.813
Most of the deals were
government to government.

12:53.856 --> 12:57.650
And it was a mostly private club
with a lifetime club president.

12:58.277 --> 13:00.862
- That's him.
- Who, the big shot?

13:00.905 --> 13:02.864
Simeon Weisz.

13:02.948 --> 13:06.618
Angola, Mozambique,
those Exocet missiles in the Falklands.

13:06.702 --> 13:09.370
He was selling guns
before there was gunpowder.

13:10.247 --> 13:11.831
I'll be right back.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.587
Mr. Weisz. Mr. Weisz.

13:18.339 --> 13:20.131
It's okay. They're talking.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.883
- May I help?
- Yes.

13:21.926 --> 13:25.553
A mutual friend, Eli Kurtzman,
from Brighton Beach, import, exports,

13:25.596 --> 13:26.805
said to contact you.

13:26.889 --> 13:31.017
I have a business proposal
and I thought perhaps we could discuss it.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.978
I don't think you and I
are in the same business, son.

13:34.730 --> 13:37.023
You think I just sell guns, don't you?

13:37.149 --> 13:38.900
I don't. I take sides.

13:38.984 --> 13:42.612
But in the Iran-Iraq war,
you sold guns to both sides.

13:42.988 --> 13:46.241
Did you ever consider
that I wanted both sides to lose?

13:47.743 --> 13:50.745
Bullets change governments
far surer than votes.

13:51.997 --> 13:56.042
You're in the wrong place, my young friend.
This is no place for amateurs.

14:00.382 --> 14:01.681
Motherfucker.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.800
Curious how you always revert
to your native tongue

14:03.884 --> 14:05.552
in moments of extreme anger

14:06.554 --> 14:07.929
and ecstasy.

14:10.482 --> 14:13.640
Oh God... Oh, God!

14:20.526 --> 14:23.611
Oh, you are beautiful.

14:24.196 --> 14:25.780
What's your name again?

14:31.829 --> 14:35.665
The only option for Vitaly and me
was under the counter gunrunning.

14:37.793 --> 14:41.421
I got my first break in Lebanon
after the suicide bombing.

14:43.799 --> 14:46.634
But I wasn't the only local kid
making good.

14:50.764 --> 14:55.226
When the United States leaves a war zone,
they generally don't take their munitions.

14:55.644 --> 14:58.688
It costs more to bring it back
than to buy new stock.

14:59.481 --> 15:02.734
So, we sell by the kilo.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.486
They're secondhand weapons,
but they're still okay.

15:08.991 --> 15:11.701
- How many kilos would you like?
- 5,000.

15:11.785 --> 15:13.620
I had a flair for languages.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.915
But I soon discovered
that what talks best is dollars,

15:16.999 --> 15:20.752
dinars, drachmas, rubles,
rupees and pounds-fucking-sterling.

15:21.003 --> 15:24.005
Of course, the US Army
got a piece of the action.

15:24.089 --> 15:27.508
Army salaries were no better
in the '80s than they are today.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.637
And some of the brass,
like Lieutenant Colonel Southern,

15:30.679 --> 15:33.514
needed to raise money
for their own private wars.

15:33.599 --> 15:35.600
Good to make your acquaintance.

15:35.893 --> 15:40.104
This is bullshit money, V.
This is small fucking potatoes.

15:40.189 --> 15:41.731
What do you want to do, go more legit?

15:41.815 --> 15:43.524
No, more illegal.

15:44.151 --> 15:47.362
What I would give right now
for a plate of cabbage and potatoes.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.557
It's not our fight.

16:16.892 --> 16:18.518
V, come on.

16:19.895 --> 16:21.729
Let's go. Come on.

16:33.283 --> 16:35.910
Selling guns is like
selling vacuum cleaners.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.788
You make calls,
pound the pavement, take orders.

16:38.872 --> 16:41.124
I was an equal opportunity
merchant of death.

16:41.208 --> 16:44.002
I supplied every army
but the Salvation Army.

16:46.797 --> 16:49.507
I sold Israeli-made Uzis to Muslims.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.682
I sold communist-made bullets to fascists.

16:58.616 --> 17:00.643
I hope you're not thinking of
selling these, Mr. Orlov.

17:00.883 --> 17:02.181
Personal use.

17:02.411 --> 17:03.180
Personal use.

17:03.420 --> 17:05.137
There's a hundred thousand
bullets here.

17:05.377 --> 17:07.075
I'm kind of trigger happy.

17:07.315 --> 17:08.545
Trigger happy?

17:14.532 --> 17:19.119
I even shipped cargo to Afghanistan
when they were fighting my fellow Soviets.

17:19.413 --> 17:21.622
I never sold to Osama bin Laden.

17:21.665 --> 17:25.960
Not on any moral grounds.
Back then, he was always bouncing checks.

17:35.471 --> 17:36.637
By the mid '80s,

17:36.680 --> 17:40.808
my weapons were represented
in eight of the world's top 10 war zones.

18:10.047 --> 18:12.006
There's no problem leading a double life.

18:12.091 --> 18:15.009
It's the triple and quadruple lives
that get you in the end.

18:15.094 --> 18:19.388
Back then, I carried a French, British,
Israeli and Ukrainian passport

18:19.473 --> 18:23.017
and a student visa for the US.
But that's another story.

18:23.060 --> 18:27.271
I also packed six different briefcases,
depending on who I was that day

18:27.356 --> 18:29.524
and the region of the world I was visiting.

18:30.114 --> 18:33.909
North of Cartagena, Colombia - 1989

18:34.738 --> 18:36.531
Without operations like mine,

18:36.615 --> 18:40.993
it would be impossible for certain
countries to conduct a respectable war.

18:41.286 --> 18:45.456
I was able to navigate around
those inconvenient little arms embargoes.

18:45.541 --> 18:47.708
There are three basic types of arms deal.

18:47.793 --> 18:50.545
White being legal, black being illegal

18:50.629 --> 18:53.422
and my personal favorite color, gray.

18:53.674 --> 18:56.134
Sometimes I made the deals so convoluted,

18:56.218 --> 18:59.011
it was hard for me to work out
if they were on the level.

18:59.054 --> 19:02.223
To keep authorities in the dark,
I often spoke in code.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.351
Rocket launchers were "mothers,"
the rockets, "children."

19:05.394 --> 19:09.313
The AK-47 assault rifle
was the "angel king."

19:09.398 --> 19:10.773
It's Yuri.

19:11.567 --> 19:14.443
Yeah, well, yeah, Raoul...

19:14.611 --> 19:17.864
Raoul, the angel king will arrive tomorrow.

19:19.032 --> 19:21.200
Hallelujah to you, too. All right.

19:21.243 --> 19:23.744
The point is, if I've done my job right,

19:23.787 --> 19:27.665
an arms embargo should be practically
impossible to enforce.

19:28.417 --> 19:33.004
What? Okay, just slow the fuck down.

19:33.213 --> 19:35.965
I can't understand you. What?

19:36.049 --> 19:39.051
What do you mean, tipped off?
They know where we are?

19:39.094 --> 19:42.388
Well, where are they?
Well, how long have I got?

19:42.431 --> 19:45.516
Not long? What does that mean? Shit.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.351
- Do we try to lose them?
- On this?

19:47.436 --> 19:51.105
- Yuri, we have to get off this thing.
- No, no one's going anywhere. Slow.

19:51.148 --> 19:53.399
Dead slow. Buy me time.

19:56.195 --> 19:59.280
Yeah, it's Yuri. Get that fucking rag down!

19:59.364 --> 20:01.449
I need another handle for this tub.

20:01.491 --> 20:03.618
Something in our weight class.

20:03.660 --> 20:07.496
You, over the side.
We're changing the name. Now!

20:08.832 --> 20:10.791
Yes, it's gotta check out.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.794
The way I looked at it, what's in a name?

20:13.837 --> 20:15.129
Have you got a shorter name?

20:15.214 --> 20:18.382
I'd often change the registration
of a ship or a plane.

20:18.508 --> 20:20.509
But never at such short notice.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.640
Damn, they're hauling.

20:26.808 --> 20:30.603
What? "Kono."
How do you spell that? K-O-N-O.

20:30.646 --> 20:32.313
Okay, well, that's good. Kono.

20:32.397 --> 20:34.815
K-O-N-O.

20:34.858 --> 20:36.943
What are we flying? Dutch. Got it.

20:36.985 --> 20:38.736
V, get me a Dutch flag, would you?

20:49.539 --> 20:52.625
Faster or I'll send your ass in!

20:52.668 --> 20:54.043
Yuri, I don't have Dutch.

20:54.127 --> 20:55.836
- What?
- I've got Belgium.

20:55.879 --> 20:56.879
What the fuck use is that?

20:56.964 --> 20:59.590
He's painting a name
registered in the fucking Netherlands.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.302
- I've got a French flag.
- So?

21:03.345 --> 21:06.305
Turn it sideways, it's Dutch.

21:08.058 --> 21:10.059
That's why you're my brother.

21:32.374 --> 21:35.209
All right, good.
Everybody look innocent now.

21:44.803 --> 21:47.054
They say every man has his price.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.223
But not every man gets it.

21:49.266 --> 21:52.143
Interpol agent Jack Valentine
couldn't be bought,

21:52.227 --> 21:53.728
at least not with money.

21:54.313 --> 21:57.023
For Jack, glory was the prize.

21:57.065 --> 21:59.608
Yeah, it's the Kono.
It's not the Kristol.

22:00.027 --> 22:02.236
Kono. K-O-N-O.

22:02.279 --> 22:05.114
- It's clean, sir.
- It's clean?

22:05.407 --> 22:07.325
Sure doesn't look clean.

22:07.409 --> 22:08.909
I'm gonna go aboard.

22:09.036 --> 22:11.954
Phone in a sighting of the Kristol
south of Aruba.

22:19.254 --> 22:21.922
Even when I was up against
an overzealous agent,

22:22.007 --> 22:25.134
I had a number of methods
for discouraging a search.

22:25.218 --> 22:29.013
I routinely mislabeled
my arms shipments "farm machinery."

22:29.097 --> 22:31.932
And I have yet to meet
the lowly paid customs official

22:32.017 --> 22:34.935
who will open a container
marked "radioactive waste"

22:34.978 --> 22:37.271
to verify its contents.

22:37.356 --> 22:39.899
But my personal favorite
is the unique combination

22:39.941 --> 22:43.110
of week-old potatoes and tropical heat.

22:57.793 --> 22:59.168
It smells.

23:01.463 --> 23:04.090
Sir, sighting of the Kristol due north.

23:05.133 --> 23:08.594
Most importantly, I kept a number
of intelligence people on the payroll

23:08.637 --> 23:11.847
to supply their colleagues
with counterintelligence.

23:11.932 --> 23:13.140
Let's go.

23:25.404 --> 23:27.196
The second rule of gunrunning is,

23:27.280 --> 23:30.324
always ensure you have a foolproof way
to get paid.

23:30.409 --> 23:34.036
Preferably in advance,
ideally to an offshore account.

23:34.204 --> 23:36.997
That's why I chose my customers
so carefully.

23:37.124 --> 23:39.667
Say what you like
about warlords and dictators.

23:39.709 --> 23:42.378
They tend to have
a highly developed sense of order.

23:42.462 --> 23:44.672
They always pay their bills on time.

23:44.350 --> 23:45.840
What is this?

23:47.188 --> 23:49.476
Six kilos of pure.

23:49.715 --> 23:51.343
I can't hand this to my fucking bank...

23:51.583 --> 23:53.283
...teller at Chase Manhattan.

23:53.982 --> 23:57.748
Listen, asshole, you should be
thanking me.

23:57.987 --> 24:00.344
Have you checked the street price today?

24:00.584 --> 24:03.742
With the seizures at the border last week,

24:03.982 --> 24:05.850
it's jumped thirty percent.

24:06.528 --> 24:07.695
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:07.349 --> 24:10.785
I sell guns. I don't sell drugs.

24:11.015 --> 24:11.983
Diversify.

24:12.213 --> 24:13.482
I've got standards.

24:13.721 --> 24:16.208
You don't pay, you don't play.

24:16.448 --> 24:17.679
Fuck you!

24:18.582 --> 24:19.665
What the fuck are you doing?

24:19.708 --> 24:21.250
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

24:20.756 --> 24:22.214
No, you don't fuck him.

24:22.454 --> 24:24.751
We can work something out.

24:27.007 --> 24:28.299
No, V.

24:27.847 --> 24:29.815
We have a deal!

24:31.344 --> 24:32.553
Shit.

24:32.637 --> 24:35.973
The first and most important rule
of gunrunning

24:36.057 --> 24:38.726
is never get shot
with your own merchandise.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.187
You okay?

24:41.897 --> 24:43.481
I think so.

24:43.773 --> 24:47.318
- So what do we do now?
- Let's celebrate.

25:05.253 --> 25:06.587
God.

25:11.551 --> 25:13.928
That narco-guerilla had his facts right.

25:13.970 --> 25:16.430
After shipping it stateside,
the return on that blow

25:16.473 --> 25:18.432
netted me a healthy profit.

25:18.475 --> 25:21.560
It would have been even better,
except one kilo never made it back.

25:22.270 --> 25:23.646
Vitaly.

25:24.731 --> 25:25.898
V.

25:29.611 --> 25:33.072
To this day, I don't know what
Vitaly was running away from.

25:33.114 --> 25:34.949
Maybe just from Vitaly.

25:36.201 --> 25:40.120
I found him 12 days, 2,000 miles
and 150 grams later

25:40.205 --> 25:41.789
in a Bolivian boarding house.

25:46.169 --> 25:49.421
Of course, my dream girl
had gotten there before me.

25:56.513 --> 25:57.638
V.

26:07.691 --> 26:08.899
Come on.

26:25.208 --> 26:28.335
Yuri. It's my brother, Yuri.

26:29.337 --> 26:30.838
He's my big brother.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.341
What the fuck is that?

26:34.384 --> 26:37.177
Ukraine. I was young.

26:37.262 --> 26:39.680
But I remember. Look.

26:40.015 --> 26:44.351
I start in Odessa, right?
And then I work my way to the Crimean.

26:44.769 --> 26:47.062
You're gonna be dead
before you fucking reach Kiev.

26:47.147 --> 26:49.481
- Come on, we're going home.
- You fuck!

26:49.524 --> 26:53.569
You fucking fuck! You fucking fuck!

26:53.778 --> 26:55.696
What the fuck is your problem?

27:02.454 --> 27:04.204
Come on, Vit.

27:05.852 --> 27:06.951
J.F.K. Airport, New York - 1989

27:07.208 --> 27:08.584
It's so nice to be home.

27:08.668 --> 27:10.377
Yeah, we're... We're gonna get you home.

27:10.420 --> 27:11.879
Come on.

27:12.555 --> 27:16.710
St. Francis Rehabilitation Center

27:22.641 --> 27:24.266
Get out of the car.

27:28.063 --> 27:30.731
Vitaly, I need you to get out of the car.

27:32.859 --> 27:34.818
I promised our parents.

27:36.363 --> 27:37.404
Please.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.032
Vitaly, you're gonna have a great time.
This is a top place.

27:40.075 --> 27:41.992
Two Ford models checked in last week.

27:42.077 --> 27:44.078
And that cute weathergirl's
been here since July.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.330
Please, please.

27:47.123 --> 27:48.415
Please, Yuri.

28:06.768 --> 28:08.435
You're a good brother.

28:10.438 --> 28:11.438
Okay.

28:11.523 --> 28:13.941
- You're a good brother, Yuri.
- Okay, all right.

28:14.025 --> 28:17.486
- Good brother.
- All right, get out of the car. Okay.

28:19.280 --> 28:20.823
Get out of the car.

28:27.497 --> 28:30.124
From then on, I was a one-man operation.

28:30.208 --> 28:33.502
I never understood what separated
the recreational drug user

28:33.586 --> 28:36.130
from the habitual, but
for the grace of God,

28:36.172 --> 28:39.758
it could have been me snorting
lines as long as the Belt Parkway.

28:40.260 --> 28:44.388
However, I wasn't entirely free
of the grip of addiction myself.

28:44.472 --> 28:47.349
There she was again. Ava Fontaine.

28:47.809 --> 28:50.519
In my neighborhood,
they say, "The good get out."

28:50.603 --> 28:53.147
In our own ways,
we'd both conquered the world.

28:54.182 --> 28:58.850
St. Barts, French Caribbean - 1989

29:10.707 --> 29:12.666
You can't force someone
to fall in love with you.

29:12.751 --> 29:15.210
But you can definitely improve your odds.

29:16.171 --> 29:19.006
It cost me $20,000
to book her for a fake photo shoot.

29:19.048 --> 29:21.717
Another $12,000 to buy out the hotel.

30:04.552 --> 30:06.512
It's a popular hotel, huh?

30:10.600 --> 30:12.684
- Ava Fontaine.
- Yuri Orlov.

30:13.186 --> 30:14.603
What brings you to St. Barts?

30:14.687 --> 30:17.231
Photo shoot. At least that was the plan.

30:17.482 --> 30:20.067
Guess the photographer
got stuck in Miami.

30:20.109 --> 30:22.736
Hurricane, though there's nothing
on the news.

30:23.404 --> 30:26.073
Those things can come out of nowhere.

30:27.408 --> 30:30.118
So, the job's been canceled,
and wouldn't you know it,

30:30.203 --> 30:32.371
there's no flight back to New York
until Tuesday.

30:32.413 --> 30:35.415
You can hitch a ride with me if you like.
I'm leaving tomorrow.

30:35.667 --> 30:39.419
Meanwhile, why don't I take your picture?

30:40.505 --> 30:42.005
In my experience,

30:42.090 --> 30:45.801
some of the most successful relationships
are based on lies and deceit.

30:45.885 --> 30:47.803
Since that's where they
usually end up anyway,

30:47.887 --> 30:49.721
it's a logical place to start.

30:49.764 --> 30:51.932
Right there. Right there. Hold it.

30:52.016 --> 30:53.767
Oh, my God!

30:56.980 --> 31:00.440
I nearly went broke
trying to convince her I was anything but.

31:02.110 --> 31:05.654
I knew Ava was not the kind of woman
to be seduced by a ride in a private jet,

31:05.738 --> 31:07.489
unless you owned the jet.

31:08.116 --> 31:09.616
This is your plane?

31:09.659 --> 31:11.451
That is my name.

31:11.536 --> 31:12.911
Of course I was lying.

31:12.954 --> 31:16.582
The plane was a rental like the car
and even the suit I was standing in.

31:16.624 --> 31:19.585
At the last minute,
I bribed the crew for the paint job.

31:19.627 --> 31:21.753
Luckily by the time we landed,

31:21.838 --> 31:24.673
Ava wasn't looking anywhere
but in my eyes.

31:25.633 --> 31:27.467
I had no idea.

31:28.469 --> 31:30.637
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

31:30.680 --> 31:33.724
Don't apologize.
I put clothes on for a living.

31:33.808 --> 31:35.684
Well, at least you're not taking them off.

31:35.768 --> 31:38.645
I would be if half the photographers
had their way.

31:38.855 --> 31:40.564
What about you?

31:40.648 --> 31:43.901
I'm in transport.
International air freight mostly.

31:44.193 --> 31:45.569
Business is good.

31:47.238 --> 31:48.697
Where are you from?

31:48.781 --> 31:50.991
I was born in Ukraine
but I grew up in Brooklyn.

31:51.075 --> 31:53.118
- No.
- What, you, too?

31:53.161 --> 31:54.661
Williamsburg.

31:58.166 --> 32:00.125
Well, here's to a hurricane.

32:01.461 --> 32:03.545
Without it I never would have met you.

32:04.923 --> 32:07.299
This is no accident, is it, Yuri?

32:11.721 --> 32:13.430
It feels like fate.

32:14.557 --> 32:16.391
I don't believe in fate.

32:17.644 --> 32:19.645
What do you believe in?

33:01.312 --> 33:03.188
Is that a view or is that a view?

33:03.231 --> 33:04.982
That's a view.

33:15.910 --> 33:18.328
Thank you. Thank you all.

33:22.887 --> 33:23.856
Congratulations.

33:23.209 --> 33:24.418
Congratulations.

33:24.460 --> 33:25.752
Thanks.

33:27.755 --> 33:31.174
Always remember, Son,
there's something above you.

33:31.300 --> 33:34.761
Sure, Dad. A $40,000 crystal chandelier.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.558
Make yourselves at home.

33:39.726 --> 33:41.977
Go. Go!

33:56.242 --> 33:58.744
I'm sorry. Today must be tough.

34:00.288 --> 34:03.582
Be nice to have a couple more guests
from my side of the family.

34:03.958 --> 34:05.834
I'm sure they're watching right now.

34:06.210 --> 34:07.669
Thank you.

34:08.504 --> 34:11.630
But you don't believe that, Yuri.
Remember?

34:14.469 --> 34:18.722
I know you, Yuri.
I know you're not everything you seem.

34:20.391 --> 34:23.060
Don't worry. I won't ask
a lot of questions.

34:23.643 --> 34:25.645
I don't want to hear you lie.

34:26.731 --> 34:28.315
You take risks.

34:28.815 --> 34:32.652
Just promise me you won't risk us.

34:34.322 --> 34:37.114
That's the trouble with falling in love
with a dream girl.

34:37.158 --> 34:39.618
They have a habit of becoming real.

34:44.956 --> 34:47.667
I've never been so glad to see Vitaly.

34:47.710 --> 34:50.337
- So fucking beautiful!
- Oh!

34:51.797 --> 34:56.676
Brother, brother, thank you so much
for giving me such a beautiful sister.

34:56.719 --> 34:59.221
He was out of rehab and out of his mind.

34:59.305 --> 35:01.389
Dance! Dance! Dance! We have to dance!

35:01.474 --> 35:04.059
- All right, all right.
- It's a wedding. A celebration. To Yuri!

35:04.143 --> 35:06.478
But for once, he rescued me.

35:07.213 --> 35:09.270
New York - December 25, 1991

35:10.024 --> 35:12.025
I was still living way beyond my means.

35:12.068 --> 35:15.612
Mortgaged to the hilt,
using one credit card to pay off another.

35:15.696 --> 35:18.365
Anything to keep Ava
in the style to which she had,

35:18.407 --> 35:21.118
thanks largely to me, become accustomed.

35:21.202 --> 35:24.079
Ava. Ava, this is too much.

35:24.163 --> 35:25.622
Yuri likes to spoil you.

35:25.706 --> 35:28.291
Then suddenly,
all my Christmases came at once.

35:28.376 --> 35:31.128
Nicki, you did it! Good boy!

35:31.879 --> 35:33.505
That's my grandson!

35:33.548 --> 35:35.882
Yuri, don't you want to see
what your son is doing?

35:35.925 --> 35:38.051
Whoever said it's better
to give than receive

35:38.136 --> 35:41.930
never got a Christmas present
like the one I got in 1991

35:42.014 --> 35:43.557
from Mikhail Gorbachev.

35:43.599 --> 35:46.643
- What the hell's the matter?
- It's over! It's over!

35:46.727 --> 35:48.687
- What's over?
- The Cold-fucking-War!

35:48.729 --> 35:51.022
The Soviet-fucking-Union!
The Evil-fucking-Empire.

35:51.065 --> 35:53.483
Mikhail's saying no más.
He's throwing in the towel.

35:53.568 --> 35:54.901
It's over!

35:58.489 --> 36:01.241
- Your son is walking.
- That's incredible, honey.

36:07.039 --> 36:09.249
At least there'll be religious freedom.

36:09.667 --> 36:11.334
Let's hope so.

36:12.378 --> 36:14.462
I think I'll go back for a visit.

36:14.755 --> 36:17.090
Do you stay in touch with Uncle Dmitri?

36:20.761 --> 36:22.429
I'm not a fool, Yuri.

36:24.390 --> 36:27.517
I don't think you're going to Odessa
to sell Pepsi-Cola.

36:31.606 --> 36:33.982
Is this how you want to be remembered?

36:35.776 --> 36:39.988
I don't want to be remembered at all.
If I'm being remembered it means I'm dead.

36:41.657 --> 36:44.117
Merry fucking Christmas!

36:44.827 --> 36:46.494
Who is this, Vitaly?

36:47.038 --> 36:50.123
- I'm Angel.
- Her name really is Angel.

36:50.958 --> 36:52.792
She's a fairy.

36:55.296 --> 36:58.048
Let's put her on top of the Christmas tree.

36:58.132 --> 36:59.299
Come on.

37:03.971 --> 37:06.473
- I love you!
- Come on.

37:06.515 --> 37:07.933
I love you all.

37:10.561 --> 37:11.811
Take this.

37:29.789 --> 37:31.623
I'm going back to Ukraine.

37:35.294 --> 37:36.878
I miss Odessa.

37:46.222 --> 37:48.431
- I miss you.
- I miss you.

37:51.519 --> 37:54.187
Be careful, Yuri. Those
things you sell kill.

37:56.899 --> 37:58.066
Inside.

38:01.028 --> 38:02.654
You're high.

38:03.781 --> 38:05.365
Well, it's true.

38:08.536 --> 38:10.203
Hello, Christian.

38:14.148 --> 38:17.245
Odessa, Ukraine - 1992

38:17.878 --> 38:21.172
During the Cold War the Red Army
stationed nearly one million troops

38:21.215 --> 38:24.676
in Ukraine because of its
strategic military importance.

38:25.177 --> 38:28.680
The day after The Wall came down
the paychecks stopped coming.

38:29.053 --> 38:30.572
Your papers.

38:30.433 --> 38:33.059
There's nothing better for an arms dealer
than the combination

38:33.102 --> 38:36.646
of disgruntled soldiers
and warehouses full of weapons.

38:37.414 --> 38:38.642
Welcome.

38:39.817 --> 38:42.152
I was hoping Major General Dmitri Volkoff

38:42.236 --> 38:45.905
would open a lot of armory doors
in a lot of military bases.

38:45.990 --> 38:48.074
For a start, he was family.

38:48.117 --> 38:50.618
He was a highly decorated hero
of the Red Army

38:50.703 --> 38:53.163
and he was almost permanently shit-faced.

38:53.247 --> 38:56.624
I can't just sell you
government property, Yuri.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.211
I have to report.

39:00.254 --> 39:02.589
Report to who? Moscow?

39:05.384 --> 39:08.011
As of last week,
Moscow's in a foreign country.

39:08.095 --> 39:09.471
New flag, new boss.

39:09.555 --> 39:11.431
There is no new boss yet.

39:11.474 --> 39:13.058
They're all too busy squabbling

39:13.100 --> 39:16.686
over who's gonna get the presidential
holiday home at the Black Sea.

39:17.438 --> 39:19.022
It's beautiful.

39:19.106 --> 39:22.901
The ones who know don't care anymore
and the ones who care don't know.

39:27.114 --> 39:28.490
Show me your inventory.

39:39.668 --> 39:43.254
Those 45 years of mutual hatred
between the East and the West

39:43.297 --> 39:46.383
had generated the highest
weapons build-up in history.

39:46.467 --> 39:49.469
The Soviets had guns
coming out of the demon hole.

39:49.512 --> 39:52.722
Huge stockpiles, and now no enemy.

39:53.724 --> 39:55.850
How many Kalashnikovs do you have?

39:58.312 --> 39:59.813
Forty thousand.

40:00.439 --> 40:01.940
Is that a four?

40:02.233 --> 40:05.276
Doesn't look like a four to me.
Looks more like a one.

40:06.195 --> 40:07.320
No, it's a four.

40:07.405 --> 40:11.616
It's whatever we say it is because
no one else will know the difference.

40:14.036 --> 40:16.955
Ten thousand Kalashnikovs for a battalion.

40:18.124 --> 40:20.542
Your stocks
are dangerously depleted, Dmitri.

40:21.168 --> 40:23.586
You should order more from the factory.

40:23.921 --> 40:25.839
Someone will work it out.

40:27.466 --> 40:28.716
What happens then?

40:28.801 --> 40:30.385
We'll cut them in.

40:33.431 --> 40:37.225
The end of the Cold War was the beginning
of the hottest time in arms dealing.

40:37.309 --> 40:39.436
The arms bazaar was open.

40:40.104 --> 40:42.355
Guided missiles, unguided missiles,

40:42.398 --> 40:45.525
mortars, mines, armored personnel carriers.

40:45.568 --> 40:47.068
Whole tank divisions.

40:47.984 --> 40:49.112
I'll tell you what I'll do.

40:49.352 --> 40:51.719
Buy six, you get one free.

40:52.533 --> 40:55.743
I even landed a squadron
of helicopter gunships.

41:08.507 --> 41:10.925
The most sophisticated fighting machines,

41:11.010 --> 41:13.803
built for a war with America
that never happened.

41:14.148 --> 41:17.054
Son, get off there before you get hurt.

41:17.284 --> 41:19.543
I can take it apart with my eyes closed.

41:19.643 --> 41:23.021
Thanks to me,
they'd finally get to fire a shot in anger.

41:31.405 --> 41:35.200
I have a feeling it wasn't exactly
what comrade Lenin had in mind

41:35.242 --> 41:38.411
when he advocated
the redistribution of wealth.

41:38.454 --> 41:42.540
But I wasn't the only one
offering a crash course in capitalism.

41:44.293 --> 41:45.877
I had rivals.

41:46.378 --> 41:50.131
Inform your commanding officer
that Simeon Weisz is here to meet him.

41:53.260 --> 41:54.802
You don't know who I am, do you?

41:55.216 --> 41:57.274
I don't give a fuck who you are.

42:07.274 --> 42:08.650
You're late.

42:09.735 --> 42:11.194
So it appears.

42:24.047 --> 42:25.178
Thank you.

42:25.657 --> 42:27.086
My pleasure.

42:27.315 --> 42:28.874
You sell guns?

42:30.322 --> 42:32.180
Maybe you'd like to come to my room

42:32.419 --> 42:36.406
and I'll show you my... cannon.

42:40.975 --> 42:44.102
You look a little lost, Simeon.
Is the world changing too fast?

42:44.895 --> 42:46.437
I'm here, aren't I?

42:46.480 --> 42:48.231
Not all of you, I think.

42:48.315 --> 42:50.858
You've gotten so rich selling for the CIA

42:50.943 --> 42:53.945
you can't seem to get that ideology
completely out of your head.

42:53.988 --> 42:56.072
Oh, the Cold War had its uses.

42:57.116 --> 42:58.992
Kept the tensions frozen.

43:00.244 --> 43:03.871
Now it's harder to determine
which side one's on.

43:03.956 --> 43:05.832
Things have become more complicated.

43:05.916 --> 43:07.625
No, it's gotten simpler.

43:08.127 --> 43:11.379
There's no place in gunrunning
for politics anymore, Simeon.

43:11.505 --> 43:13.840
I sell to leftists and rightists.

43:13.924 --> 43:17.802
I'd sell to pacifists but they're not
the most regular of customers.

43:18.220 --> 43:20.096
Of course, you're not a
true internationalist

43:20.180 --> 43:22.890
until you've supplied weapons
to kill your own countrymen.

43:25.477 --> 43:28.980
This current state of chaos
won't last forever.

43:30.357 --> 43:32.191
There'll have to be order.

43:34.528 --> 43:39.115
Instead of cutting each other's throats,
it may be beneficial if we work together.

43:39.199 --> 43:40.366
What do you think?

43:43.412 --> 43:45.038
What do I think?

43:45.873 --> 43:48.082
I think you're the amateur now.

43:48.584 --> 43:50.752
I think you should go with your instincts.

43:50.836 --> 43:52.545
With your first instinct.

43:52.921 --> 43:55.840
I'm the same man who was not
good enough for you before

43:55.883 --> 43:59.218
and I'm just not good enough for you now.

44:13.400 --> 44:16.402
The problem with gunrunners going to war

44:17.613 --> 44:20.573
is that there's no shortage of ammunition.

44:22.993 --> 44:26.663
This was the chaos
that the Old Guard had always feared.

44:27.081 --> 44:30.750
As far as they were concerned,
I was giving arms dealers a bad name.

44:30.793 --> 44:34.462
But then they could hardly report me
to the Better Business Bureau.

44:35.923 --> 44:38.424
And Ukraine wasn't the only former state

44:38.467 --> 44:41.302
with an unpaid army
and stockpiles of guns.

44:41.553 --> 44:46.265
There was Bulgaria, Hungary,
Poland, Belarus,

44:46.392 --> 44:48.559
all there for the taking.

44:52.648 --> 44:55.566
Of all the weapons
in the vast Soviet arsenal,

44:55.609 --> 44:59.070
nothing was more profitable
than Avtomat Kalashnikova,

44:59.113 --> 45:00.905
model of 1947,

45:00.948 --> 45:04.992
more commonly known
as the AK-47 or Kalashnikov.

45:05.077 --> 45:08.079
It's the world's most popular assault rife.

45:08.122 --> 45:10.164
A weapon all fighters love.

45:10.249 --> 45:12.709
An elegantly simple
nine-pound amalgamation

45:12.793 --> 45:14.627
of forged steel and plywood.

45:14.670 --> 45:17.296
It doesn't break, jam, or overheat.

45:17.423 --> 45:20.800
It will shoot whether it's covered in mud
or filled with sand.

45:20.843 --> 45:24.470
It's so easy, even a child can use it,
and they do.

45:24.555 --> 45:26.556
The Soviets put the gun on a coin.

45:26.640 --> 45:28.933
Mozambique put it on their flag.

45:29.268 --> 45:30.643
Since the end of the Cold War

45:30.728 --> 45:34.397
the Kalashnikov has become
the Russian people's greatest export.

45:34.481 --> 45:38.151
After that comes vodka, caviar
and suicidal novelists.

45:38.819 --> 45:42.822
One thing's for sure.
No one was lining up to buy their cars.

45:57.586 --> 45:59.853
What fucking documents?

46:04.348 --> 46:06.477
You listen to me, Lieutenant.

46:06.717 --> 46:08.945
You keep them there.
For as long as you can!

46:09.185 --> 46:10.713
Fight You listen to me, Lieutenant.

46:10.953 --> 46:12.181
To the death! Moscow is behind us!

46:12.421 --> 46:13.510
It's an order!

46:13.854 --> 46:16.314
I thought you were supposed to be
watching out for these people.

46:16.356 --> 46:19.358
How can I?
You keep selling my helicopters.

46:19.401 --> 46:21.194
You are too greedy, Yuri.

46:21.361 --> 46:23.196
I can't hold him forever.

46:23.280 --> 46:26.157
- I've got paperwork.
- Not for the gunships.

46:26.200 --> 46:28.910
You know the penalty for sanction-busting.

46:28.994 --> 46:32.038
Selling the military helicopter
is a major violation.

46:32.122 --> 46:34.248
Military helicopter.

46:38.086 --> 46:40.046
It's not a military helicopter.

46:40.088 --> 46:42.423
It's a rescue helicopter.

46:42.508 --> 46:44.217
Get to work, son.

46:44.518 --> 46:45.647
No problem.

46:47.095 --> 46:48.888
The law is on our side.

47:08.534 --> 47:10.284
All right, let me see your papers.

47:11.328 --> 47:13.955
No, no, put that away.
Let's see your papers.

47:14.039 --> 47:16.582
- Yuri Orlov.
- Mr. Orlov.

47:16.625 --> 47:18.584
Always in the wrong place
at the right time.

47:21.713 --> 47:24.632
We've met before.
Off the coast of Columbia.

47:24.758 --> 47:26.759
What was the name of that freighter?
I can't remember.

47:26.844 --> 47:29.595
Was it Kono or the Kristol?

47:29.638 --> 47:34.141
The crew called that vessel a lot of names,
none of them repeatable in polite company.

47:34.226 --> 47:37.270
- Answer the question.
- The new MP-5.

47:38.063 --> 47:39.772
Would you like a silencer for that?

47:39.857 --> 47:41.566
I need to see your papers.

47:42.720 --> 47:43.781
Get the fuck off me.

47:44.278 --> 47:45.486
Dmitri!

47:49.783 --> 47:54.370
The end-user certificate for this aircraft
states Burkina Faso.

47:54.746 --> 47:57.748
Nice. Very nice.
Did you type this up yourself?

47:57.791 --> 48:00.334
The helicopter is to be used
on humanitarian missions.

48:00.419 --> 48:03.421
- So, you're a humanitarian?
- Absolutely.

48:04.464 --> 48:06.132
This is a military aircraft.

48:06.216 --> 48:08.217
- Not anymore.
- Listen to the nephew.

48:08.302 --> 48:12.138
What can they do with military hardware
but convert it to civilian use?

48:12.764 --> 48:16.726
The only way you could die from this baby
now is if a food drop hits you.

48:18.979 --> 48:22.064
And this stuff over here?
Is that going to Burkina Faso as well?

48:22.149 --> 48:24.317
But to a different client
at a different address.

48:24.401 --> 48:25.902
That's just a coincidence, is that it?

48:25.986 --> 48:28.696
Do you take me
for a complete fucking fool?

48:28.780 --> 48:32.116
Not complete, sir.
And while I hesitate to tell you your job,

48:32.159 --> 48:34.827
I must point out
that when shipped separately

48:34.870 --> 48:36.704
the weapons and the aircraft both comply

48:36.788 --> 48:38.831
with the current Interpol
trade standards and practices.

48:38.874 --> 48:42.585
We both know that is an obscene
bureaucratic loophole

48:42.669 --> 48:44.837
that's gonna be closed any goddamn day.

48:44.922 --> 48:46.422
But it's not closed.

48:46.840 --> 48:50.176
And while certain people
might interpret this cargo as suspicious,

48:50.218 --> 48:51.510
thank God we live in a world

48:51.553 --> 48:53.846
where suspicion alone
does not constitute a crime.

48:53.931 --> 48:56.599
And where men like you
respect the rule of law.

49:01.688 --> 49:05.024
I was as guilty as sin,
but Valentine couldn't prove it.

49:05.108 --> 49:07.860
And he was the rarest breed
of law enforcement officer.

49:07.903 --> 49:12.031
The type who knew I was breaking the law
but wouldn't break it himself to bust me.

49:13.520 --> 49:15.318
2 DAYS LATER

49:15.911 --> 49:18.955
Valentine wasn't the only one
trying to put me out of business.

49:19.039 --> 49:21.999
My uncle had turned down
a half dozen rival arms dealers.

49:22.042 --> 49:24.377
Sometimes with offers better than mine.

49:24.586 --> 49:27.505
But to Dmitri,
you couldn't put a price on loyalty.

49:40.936 --> 49:43.896
- What was he doing here?
- He is hoping to beat your offer.

49:43.939 --> 49:47.400
I told him
to go have intercourse with himself.

49:47.442 --> 49:50.319
- But Yuri...
- You need to make more payoffs.

49:50.404 --> 49:52.029
- Too many know.
- Don't worry.

49:52.072 --> 49:55.449
There are more VCRs, cigarettes.
I left them in your new car.

49:55.993 --> 49:58.869
Even your enemy was admiring that car.

50:02.749 --> 50:06.085
- I am the luckiest man alive.
- You are.

50:45.292 --> 50:46.834
- Hello?
- Ava?

50:46.918 --> 50:48.419
Hi, baby.

50:49.463 --> 50:51.255
You forgot what time it is?

50:51.465 --> 50:53.758
I'm sorry, I...

50:53.800 --> 50:56.844
How was that... Your audition?

50:57.637 --> 50:59.555
They're going in another direction.

50:59.639 --> 51:01.515
Direction of someone who can act.

51:01.975 --> 51:03.184
They don't deserve you.

51:05.312 --> 51:08.689
Where are you? Is everything okay?

51:10.233 --> 51:12.485
It was a rough day at the office.

51:12.569 --> 51:14.945
- Come home.
- Soon.

51:14.988 --> 51:18.824
- How's Nicki?
- He misses you. We both do.

51:19.659 --> 51:22.161
It's lonely without you here.

51:22.537 --> 51:25.039
You know I don't like nights.

51:25.123 --> 51:26.999
Ever since my parents...

51:35.217 --> 51:38.052
- Yuri, what's that?
- A party.

51:38.136 --> 51:41.138
I better go.
Just wanted to call and hear your voice.

51:41.181 --> 51:43.349
- Kiss Nicki for me.
- I love you.

51:46.895 --> 51:49.271
The pillaging didn't die with my uncle.

51:50.023 --> 51:51.816
After The Wall came down,

51:51.858 --> 51:56.862
$32 billion worth of arms were stolen
and resold from Ukraine alone.

51:57.197 --> 52:00.199
One of the greatest heists
of the 20th century.

52:10.203 --> 52:13.501
Monrovia, Liberia - 1995

52:14.005 --> 52:15.923
The primary market was Africa.

52:16.258 --> 52:19.301
Eleven major conflicts
involving 32 countries

52:19.386 --> 52:22.179
in less than a decade.
A gunrunner's wet dream.

52:22.222 --> 52:24.473
At the time, the West couldn't care less.

52:24.558 --> 52:27.560
They had a white war
in what was left of Yugoslavia.

52:27.853 --> 52:30.271
I did the bulk of my business in Liberia.

52:30.355 --> 52:31.897
"Land of the Free."

52:32.065 --> 52:35.693
Originally established as a homeland
for freed American slaves,

52:35.735 --> 52:38.904
it's been enslaved by one dictator
or another ever since.

52:39.072 --> 52:42.366
The latest was American-educated
self-declared president,

52:42.409 --> 52:44.201
Andre Baptiste.

52:49.249 --> 52:51.000
Mr. Yuri!

52:52.711 --> 52:54.920
I'm Andre Baptiste Jr.

52:56.423 --> 52:58.257
My father would like to meet you.

52:58.341 --> 52:59.633
What an honor.

53:00.760 --> 53:03.596
Thank him, but unfortunately
I have other business.

53:03.680 --> 53:06.390
It's a shame. It's a very busy schedule.

53:12.898 --> 53:14.815
It is not,

53:15.442 --> 53:18.444
as they say, optional.

53:20.322 --> 53:22.948
My father is easily offended.

53:24.117 --> 53:26.118
My schedule just freed up.

53:28.205 --> 53:32.499
President Baptiste was my best customer
but I was in no hurry to meet him.

53:32.584 --> 53:35.461
He'd gotten a reputation
for routinely hacking off the limbs

53:35.545 --> 53:37.087
of those who opposed him.

53:37.130 --> 53:39.715
His seven year civil war
has been described as,

53:39.799 --> 53:43.302
"A relentless campaign
of sadistic, wanton violence."

53:43.637 --> 53:46.138
That kind of sums up Andy for me.

53:49.142 --> 53:50.851
The Glock is interesting.

53:52.145 --> 53:54.146
It's made of a polymer composite.

53:54.231 --> 53:56.815
Many of my clients feel
they can get through airport security

53:56.858 --> 53:58.859
without setting off a lot of bells
and whistles.

53:58.944 --> 54:00.778
Personally, I do not recommend that.

54:00.904 --> 54:05.032
On the other hand, if you are looking
for a traditional wheel gun,

54:05.116 --> 54:08.035
there is no substitute
for the six inches of muzzle energy

54:08.119 --> 54:11.830
of the .357 Magnum.
And of course, it will never jam.

54:14.709 --> 54:16.335
Why'd you do that?

54:16.378 --> 54:17.628
What did you say?

54:19.506 --> 54:22.841
Well, now you're gonna have to buy it.
It's a used gun.

54:24.719 --> 54:26.553
How can I sell a used gun?

54:29.015 --> 54:30.474
A used gun.

54:31.518 --> 54:32.851
A used gun?

54:34.688 --> 54:36.188
That's a good one.

54:38.817 --> 54:42.695
You know, there is no discipline
with the youth today.

54:42.779 --> 54:45.698
I try to set an example
but it is difficult.

54:47.325 --> 54:49.368
Personally, I blame MTV.

54:53.748 --> 54:55.207
A used gun.

54:59.546 --> 55:03.590
I think you and I, we can do business.

55:05.427 --> 55:09.888
If I thought I was scared of Andre Sr.,
I knew I was scared of Andre Jr.

55:10.807 --> 55:12.725
Like father like son.

55:12.767 --> 55:15.728
The guava doesn't fall
too far from the tree.

55:15.895 --> 55:17.646
He was also a cannibal.

55:17.731 --> 55:20.899
They say Andre would eat a victim's heart
while it was still beating

55:20.984 --> 55:23.193
to give him superhuman strength.

55:30.368 --> 55:33.412
Monrovia itself
was like being on another planet.

55:33.955 --> 55:35.789
Planet Monrovia.

55:35.874 --> 55:39.418
From the temperature,
it was obviously a planet close to the sun.

55:40.420 --> 55:44.048
I rarely saw another white man,
and I never left town alone.

55:44.174 --> 55:48.594
Outside town was the edge of hell.
I didn't want to even gaze into it.

55:48.678 --> 55:51.305
This is your hotel.

55:51.890 --> 55:53.307
Two stars.

55:54.768 --> 55:56.769
Can you bring me the gun of Rambo?

55:56.811 --> 55:58.896
Part one, two or three?

55:58.938 --> 56:01.607
- I've only seen part one.
- The M60.

56:01.691 --> 56:03.609
Would you like the armor piercing bullets?

56:03.693 --> 56:05.069
Please.

56:06.279 --> 56:09.156
My father left a welcoming
present in your room.

56:09.908 --> 56:11.283
Enjoy.

56:25.799 --> 56:29.802
My God, she nearly got her head cut off.

56:31.137 --> 56:35.307
When I get to America,
I will not live in Brentwood.

56:36.434 --> 56:37.726
Second floor.

56:42.649 --> 56:45.359
In the most AIDS infested region
of the globe,

56:45.443 --> 56:47.653
where one in four is infected,

56:47.737 --> 56:49.113
Andre's idea of a joke

56:49.155 --> 56:52.116
was to put a young Iman
and a young Naomi in my bed

56:52.325 --> 56:54.618
and no condom within a hundred miles.

57:09.634 --> 57:11.009
Hello, Mr. Yuri.

57:12.345 --> 57:13.512
Hi.

57:13.847 --> 57:16.014
We'd be happy to make you happy.

57:18.560 --> 57:19.810
I can't.

57:20.437 --> 57:23.522
I'd love to, but I can't.

57:24.065 --> 57:27.359
Don't worry. We don't have anything.

57:32.490 --> 57:34.074
How do you know?

57:36.536 --> 57:38.162
Do we look like it?

57:38.538 --> 57:41.331
What if I have AIDS? Don't you worry?

57:42.959 --> 57:44.626
You worry too much.

57:45.712 --> 57:49.381
Why do you worry about something
that can kill you in 10 years,

57:49.966 --> 57:53.385
when there's so many things
that can kill you today?

57:55.930 --> 57:57.097
Now,

57:59.434 --> 58:01.518
how can we make you happy?

58:04.564 --> 58:05.689
By leaving.

58:10.778 --> 58:13.572
These are my Kalashnikov Kids,

58:14.199 --> 58:15.949
my Boy Brigades.

58:17.702 --> 58:21.914
I can see what you are thinking,
but we need every man we can get.

58:22.123 --> 58:23.790
Even if they're not men?

58:24.167 --> 58:27.085
A bullet from a 14-year-old
is just as effective

58:27.128 --> 58:29.004
as one from a 40-year-old.

58:29.923 --> 58:31.673
Often more effective.

58:35.011 --> 58:37.471
No one can stop this bath of blood.

58:37.597 --> 58:40.057
It's not bath of blood, it's bloodbath.

58:41.518 --> 58:42.684
Thank you,

58:43.561 --> 58:45.437
but I prefer it my way.

58:58.117 --> 59:01.870
I am not going to pay your asking price.
We are not a rich people.

59:01.955 --> 59:05.958
And besides, the market is already flooded
with your Kalashnikovs.

59:06.125 --> 59:10.045
Do you realize in some parts of my country
you can get one for the price of a chicken?

59:10.129 --> 59:13.465
But you can't just look at the unit price.
You forget ancillary costs.

59:13.508 --> 59:15.968
End-user certificates
need to be forged and notarized.

59:16.052 --> 59:19.304
Shell companies set up, insurance
purchased, pilots and crews hired.

59:19.347 --> 59:21.098
Not to mention the bribes.

59:21.307 --> 59:24.268
You can't get a nut and bolt
out of the Eastern Bloc without a bribe.

59:24.310 --> 59:27.396
There's one bribe for the nut,
another for the bolt.

59:27.480 --> 59:30.816
Andy, Andy, listen to me.
This is an expensive proposition.

59:31.150 --> 59:32.276
Andy?

59:34.320 --> 59:37.322
I am going to pay you in timber.

59:39.826 --> 59:41.159
Or stones.

59:44.122 --> 59:45.455
Well, I'll take the stones.

59:45.498 --> 59:48.792
It's kind of hard to get a tree trunk
into my hand luggage.

59:49.836 --> 59:52.170
I know you're planning a new offensive.

59:52.213 --> 59:55.882
If you can delay a week
I can get you armored personnel carriers.

59:56.426 --> 59:59.011
They'd greatly reduce your casualties

59:59.137 --> 01:00:01.346
and give you
a significant strategic advantage.

01:00:03.683 --> 01:00:06.310
You know, they call me the Lord of War,

01:00:07.145 --> 01:00:08.645
but perhaps it is you.

01:00:09.606 --> 01:00:12.441
It's not Lord of War. It's Warlord.

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:16.570
Thank you, but I prefer it my way.

01:00:20.491 --> 01:00:23.744
Conflict diamonds
are a common currency in West Africa.

01:00:23.828 --> 01:00:25.871
Also referred to as blood diamonds,

01:00:25.955 --> 01:00:28.707
since bloodshed
is what they generally finance.

01:00:30.168 --> 01:00:33.754
By the late '90s, my wealth had caught up
to my lies about my wealth.

01:00:33.838 --> 01:00:35.922
Even surpassed my lies.

01:00:36.007 --> 01:00:38.925
I could even afford
to become a patron of the arts.

01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:49.478
I can't believe it.

01:00:50.104 --> 01:00:53.065
Well, of course it's wonderful. I just...

01:00:53.232 --> 01:00:55.692
I didn't expect it to happen so soon.

01:00:57.070 --> 01:01:00.614
Yes, well, that...
Well, that would be great, too, yeah.

01:01:03.159 --> 01:01:05.243
It's wonderful. Thank you so much.

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:08.372
It's... Yuri. Okay, thank you. Bye.

01:01:08.414 --> 01:01:12.125
Yuri, that was the dealer on the phone.
I just sold my first painting.

01:01:12.210 --> 01:01:13.835
- That's fantastic!
- Yes!

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:16.254
Who bought it?

01:01:16.297 --> 01:01:19.383
Someone important.
They wanna remain anonymous.

01:01:19.467 --> 01:01:21.635
- This is so wonderful.
- Yeah, how was your trip?

01:01:21.719 --> 01:01:23.929
You know, same old, same old.
Where's Nicki?

01:01:24.013 --> 01:01:26.598
Oh, in bed. I'm sorry. He couldn't stay up.

01:01:26.641 --> 01:01:27.683
Well, that's best.

01:01:27.767 --> 01:01:30.977
My first painting. I'm
officially an artist!

01:01:31.104 --> 01:01:33.563
- This calls for a drink.
- What doesn't?

01:01:35.441 --> 01:01:36.441
Hi.

01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:39.778
- Yuri, this is...
- Candy.

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:41.947
- Candy, of course.
- Hi.

01:01:42.532 --> 01:01:44.449
Any friend of my brother's

01:01:45.493 --> 01:01:46.993
is a friend of my brother's.

01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:50.122
You have a beautiful everything.

01:01:52.166 --> 01:01:53.375
Yes, he does.

01:01:53.459 --> 01:01:54.835
Yes, I do.

01:01:54.919 --> 01:01:57.295
- I'm gonna kiss Nicki good night.
- Okay.

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:53.852
How are you, brother?

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:57.689
Oh, you know,
still the resident family fuck up.

01:02:58.524 --> 01:03:02.778
- Yeah, well, I guess someone has to do it.
- Yeah.

01:03:04.572 --> 01:03:07.783
Hey, Ava knows, right?

01:03:13.039 --> 01:03:15.373
I never want to say anything.

01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:18.126
She doesn't have to know.
She understands.

01:03:18.211 --> 01:03:20.212
She's a survivor, like me.

01:03:20.588 --> 01:03:24.174
Well, she may be a survivor
but she's not like you.

01:03:27.553 --> 01:03:29.596
Really, she doesn't know
how you pay for all this?

01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:31.306
We don't talk about it.

01:03:32.266 --> 01:03:35.227
How many car salesmen
talk about their work, huh?

01:03:35.603 --> 01:03:36.770
How many cigarette salesmen?

01:03:36.854 --> 01:03:39.231
Both their products
kill more people every year than mine.

01:03:39.315 --> 01:03:41.817
At least mine has a safety switch.

01:03:42.735 --> 01:03:46.446
If those guys can leave their
work at the office, so can I.

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:51.159
Goddamn, you are good.

01:03:53.287 --> 01:03:54.788
You really are.

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.958
You almost had me convinced.

01:04:08.636 --> 01:04:10.095
Could you...

01:04:13.057 --> 01:04:15.267
Could you help me out with some...

01:04:21.399 --> 01:04:28.446
Why?

01:04:29.657 --> 01:04:31.241
Why what?

01:04:31.617 --> 01:04:34.703
- Why, why, why, why?
- I don't know. I don't know.

01:04:34.787 --> 01:04:36.037
Why what?

01:04:37.790 --> 01:04:39.666
Why are you so fucked up all the time?

01:04:45.631 --> 01:04:47.132
Because I am.

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:01.938
I didn't know how much Ava really knew
and how much she ignored.

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:04.900
She never questioned
how a guy in the transport business

01:05:04.984 --> 01:05:07.819
could afford to give her
18-karat diamond earrings.

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:11.281
I guess she didn't really want
to hear the answer.

01:05:11.532 --> 01:05:14.492
Mostly, she seemed content
that I was a good provider

01:05:14.535 --> 01:05:17.287
and as far as she was concerned, loyal.

01:05:17.747 --> 01:05:19.080
Despite the other women,

01:05:19.165 --> 01:05:22.542
I always made love to Ava
as if she was the only one.

01:05:26.339 --> 01:05:28.173
I'm not saying I didn't have setbacks.

01:05:28.257 --> 01:05:32.260
It's not called gunrunning for nothing.
You gotta be fast on your feet.

01:05:32.345 --> 01:05:35.388
Some revolutions blow over
before the guns even get there.

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:38.683
There's nothing more expensive
for an arms dealer than peace.

01:05:38.726 --> 01:05:42.729
Truce? What do you mean truce?
The guns are already on their way.

01:05:44.190 --> 01:05:45.607
Peace talks.

01:05:46.859 --> 01:05:49.486
All right, forget it.
I'll reroute the shipment to the Balkans.

01:05:49.528 --> 01:05:52.489
When they say they're gonna have a war,
they keep their word.

01:06:00.039 --> 01:06:04.000
Of course, a new breed of gunrunner
requires a new breed of cop.

01:06:09.006 --> 01:06:10.924
Henry, take Park Avenue.

01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:31.361
Take them on a tour of New Jersey.

01:07:05.604 --> 01:07:09.816
Yuri, there are men
going through our garbage cans.

01:07:11.027 --> 01:07:14.070
It's probably just some reporters
looking for somebody else.

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:16.948
I have a feeling
they don't work for the tabloids.

01:07:18.617 --> 01:07:19.826
Yuri,

01:07:21.912 --> 01:07:23.955
is there anything
I should be worried about?

01:07:25.666 --> 01:07:27.083
No, nothing.

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:29.294
- Nothing.
- I love you.

01:07:30.796 --> 01:07:32.130
I love you, too.

01:07:36.844 --> 01:07:37.927
Sir.

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:28.394
I was now the best merchant of death alive.

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:30.772
I didn't own my own plane. I owned a fleet.

01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:35.944
Running guns into Liberia, Sierra Leone
or the Ivory Coast at least once a week.

01:08:36.028 --> 01:08:38.363
Most trips, I had phony paperwork.

01:08:38.447 --> 01:08:41.032
If the deadline was tight
and I had to cut corners,

01:08:41.075 --> 01:08:43.033
I had no paperwork at all.

01:08:45.412 --> 01:08:47.247
But I wasn't overly concerned.

01:08:47.331 --> 01:08:49.541
There was hardly any radar
over most of Africa,

01:08:49.582 --> 01:08:51.251
and even fewer people to watch it.

01:08:56.841 --> 01:08:58.550
Charlie, Echo, India.

01:08:58.634 --> 01:09:02.720
Reroute to Kabala airport on heading 0-2-9.

01:09:02.805 --> 01:09:04.221
Comply immediately.

01:09:04.950 --> 01:09:06.707
Yuri, What the fuck is going on?

01:09:18.069 --> 01:09:20.697
Colonel Southern, it's Yuri.
I'm sorry to call you on this number,

01:09:20.738 --> 01:09:22.407
but I've got Interpol all over my ass.

01:09:22.448 --> 01:09:26.077
I can't know you right now.
It's not a good time.

01:09:28.205 --> 01:09:29.581
Not a good time?

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:34.457
Motherfucker!

01:09:38.756 --> 01:09:43.051
Charlie, Echo, India, comply immediately.
This is your last warning.

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:44.470
Where was the first fucking warning?

01:09:44.555 --> 01:09:46.389
Rock your wings if you intend to comply.

01:09:46.432 --> 01:09:47.932
I'm putting us down.

01:09:52.979 --> 01:09:55.523
If you land, we're all going away.
I don't have paperwork.

01:09:55.608 --> 01:09:58.568
- We're in a flying fucking bomb.
- They're firing bullets at our bullets.

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:02.197
- I'm putting us down.
- Okay, okay, fuck!

01:10:03.115 --> 01:10:04.782
This is Charlie, Echo, India.

01:10:04.867 --> 01:10:08.244
Request reroute to Kabala airport
on bearing 0-2-9.

01:10:08.621 --> 01:10:12.540
No, not the airport.
There, the highway. It's our only hope.

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:15.710
Are you fucking mad?
A pothole will set us off.

01:10:16.170 --> 01:10:18.004
You underestimate yourself, Aleksei.

01:10:18.088 --> 01:10:20.798
You're the best. You're the shit, Aleksei.
You're the shit!

01:10:20.883 --> 01:10:23.051
You're the shit! You're the shit!

01:10:23.969 --> 01:10:25.845
Of course, Aleksei wasn't the best.

01:10:25.930 --> 01:10:29.390
He'd come 42nd out of 43
at the Moscow Flight School.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:39.234
Oh, God, what's he doing?

01:10:39.944 --> 01:10:41.444
Is this guy nuts?

01:10:43.614 --> 01:10:44.989
I can't land there, sir.

01:10:45.032 --> 01:10:47.825
Kabala's only 15 minutes away.
He can't get far.

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:50.119
I want a truck on the tarmac.

01:12:06.739 --> 01:12:08.489
We're gonna be okay.

01:12:10.409 --> 01:12:13.411
- Where you going?
- As far from the evidence as we can get.

01:12:13.495 --> 01:12:15.580
Wait! There's not gonna be any evidence.

01:12:31.513 --> 01:12:33.097
Come here, come here.

01:12:36.143 --> 01:12:39.145
Hey, don't be shy. Here, look. Free sample.

01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:42.106
Help yourself, okay? Free sample.
Tell your friends.

01:12:42.441 --> 01:12:46.319
Come here. You want something? Look.
Want an RPG? All for you, all right?

01:12:46.403 --> 01:12:50.406
Happy times. Come on. Help yourselves!
No charge. Everything goes.

01:12:50.491 --> 01:12:53.451
Guns, guns, guns. Yeah, come on up!

01:12:53.619 --> 01:12:55.453
Here, having fun now, huh?

01:12:57.456 --> 01:13:01.042
Come on. Guns, guns, guns! Yeah!

01:13:01.293 --> 01:13:03.711
Bullets, guns, grenades.

01:13:03.796 --> 01:13:06.839
Hooray, yeah, take them all.
Take the whole crate.

01:13:06.924 --> 01:13:09.675
Go ahead, take the crate.
Everybody, come on.

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:14.222
Guns, grenades, hooray!

01:13:14.306 --> 01:13:16.933
Bullets, guns, grenades!

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:19.268
Yeah!

01:13:19.561 --> 01:13:20.937
That one's got your name on it.

01:13:20.979 --> 01:13:23.564
You want one, too? Come on.
We got bullets.

01:13:24.149 --> 01:13:25.400
Don't forget the bullets.

01:13:25.484 --> 01:13:28.069
How can you shoot a gun
if you don't have bullets?

01:13:28.153 --> 01:13:30.154
Everything goes for free.

01:13:30.656 --> 01:13:33.366
Guns, grenades, RPGs,

01:13:33.450 --> 01:13:35.827
bullets, guns, yeah!

01:13:36.036 --> 01:13:38.996
Hooray, hooray! Want some bullets?

01:13:39.623 --> 01:13:41.082
Gotta have bullets.

01:13:41.208 --> 01:13:44.419
What a cargo crew
at Heathrow Airport does in a day,

01:13:44.670 --> 01:13:48.381
took a bunch of malnourished
Sierra Leonean locals 10 minutes.

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:52.009
By the time Agent Valentine got there,

01:13:52.052 --> 01:13:54.804
you could find more guns
on a plane full of Quakers.

01:14:02.354 --> 01:14:03.521
Yuri Orlov.

01:14:05.023 --> 01:14:06.858
- Fuck!
- You run from us?

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:09.026
No, Mbizi, no.

01:14:09.153 --> 01:14:10.862
Can he run with no legs?

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:15.283
Let me make him disappear, Mr. Valentine.
Around here, people disappear all the time.

01:14:15.367 --> 01:14:16.451
I can't do that.

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:18.536
Look where we are. Who will know?

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:22.874
We will.

01:14:29.715 --> 01:14:31.716
He's gonna get what's coming to him.

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:32.967
I'm not as certain.

01:14:41.768 --> 01:14:43.436
All right, get up.

01:14:47.566 --> 01:14:50.735
- What's the charge?
- What are you doing in Sierra Leone?

01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:52.987
- I'm on safari.
- Yeah?

01:14:53.238 --> 01:14:56.699
You're hunting wildebeests
with a submachine gun?

01:14:56.742 --> 01:14:58.743
Do you also work with the Park Service?

01:14:58.827 --> 01:15:00.912
Hunting without a license.
Is that the charge?

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:04.582
Why are we playing games?
You traffic arms.

01:15:04.666 --> 01:15:06.709
- Trade.
- Trade, traffic.

01:15:07.544 --> 01:15:08.920
You get rich

01:15:09.004 --> 01:15:13.132
by giving the poorest people on the planet
the means to continue killing each other.

01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:14.926
Do you know why I do what I do?

01:15:14.968 --> 01:15:17.720
I mean, there are more
prestigious assignments.

01:15:18.055 --> 01:15:19.639
Keeping track of nuclear arsenals.

01:15:19.723 --> 01:15:23.100
You'd think that more critical
to world security, but it's not.

01:15:23.143 --> 01:15:25.311
No, nine out of 10 war victims today

01:15:25.395 --> 01:15:28.940
are killed with assault rifles
and small arms like yours.

01:15:29.024 --> 01:15:31.108
Those nuclear missiles,
they sit in their silos.

01:15:31.151 --> 01:15:34.946
Your AK-47, that is the real
weapon of mass destruction.

01:15:35.948 --> 01:15:38.449
I don't want people dead, Agent Valentine.

01:15:38.742 --> 01:15:41.827
I don't put a gun to anybody's head
and make them shoot.

01:15:41.912 --> 01:15:44.539
I admit,
a shooting war's better for business,

01:15:44.623 --> 01:15:46.999
but I prefer people to fire my guns
and miss,

01:15:47.084 --> 01:15:48.834
just as long as they're firing.

01:15:58.262 --> 01:16:01.055
Can I go now? You've got nothing on me.

01:16:01.974 --> 01:16:03.474
Except cuffs.

01:16:06.770 --> 01:16:09.480
Since you're so concerned with the law,
you must know

01:16:09.523 --> 01:16:13.651
that I'm legally permitted to hold you
for 24 hours without charging you.

01:16:14.611 --> 01:16:17.280
You might ask why I would do that,
and I can assure you

01:16:17.322 --> 01:16:20.533
it's not because I enjoy your company,
because I don't. No.

01:16:20.742 --> 01:16:25.538
The reason why I will delay you for
every second of the permissible 24 hours is

01:16:25.664 --> 01:16:29.834
I am delaying your deadly trade
and the deaths of your victims.

01:16:29.876 --> 01:16:33.754
I don't think of it as taking a day
from you, but giving a day to them.

01:16:33.839 --> 01:16:38.426
Some innocent man, woman or child
is going to have an extra day on this Earth

01:16:38.510 --> 01:16:40.177
because you're not free.

01:16:41.847 --> 01:16:43.848
So, I will see you

01:16:44.725 --> 01:16:46.517
in 23 hours

01:16:47.227 --> 01:16:48.686
and 55 minutes.

01:16:54.526 --> 01:16:58.571
Valentine knew he didn't have to guard me.
There was nowhere to go.

01:16:59.364 --> 01:17:02.366
Or maybe he was hoping
the locals would tear me apart.

01:17:02.826 --> 01:17:05.202
But they were too busy with the plane.

01:17:07.789 --> 01:17:11.334
It's like parking your car
in certain neighborhoods in the Bronx.

01:17:11.668 --> 01:17:13.461
You just don't do it.

01:17:24.890 --> 01:17:27.808
The way I look at it,
it's the way of Africa.

01:17:28.226 --> 01:17:29.560
Maybe life.

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:33.564
Everything that comes from the earth
eventually returns.

01:17:33.857 --> 01:17:36.859
Even a 40-ton Antonov-12 cargo plane.

01:18:34.710 --> 01:18:37.211
A gift for you.

01:18:39.631 --> 01:18:41.924
You know, you've arrived just in time.

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:45.720
I was afraid that he might die
before you got your chance

01:18:47.139 --> 01:18:48.514
to kill him.

01:18:54.062 --> 01:18:56.147
This man came here

01:18:57.399 --> 01:18:59.859
hoping to take your place.

01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:04.488
Is that not so?

01:19:16.126 --> 01:19:18.711
No, I'm not here to supply Mr. Baptiste.

01:19:20.464 --> 01:19:23.132
I am here to supply his enemies.

01:19:26.928 --> 01:19:29.430
I fear it's a sale I shall never complete.

01:19:32.642 --> 01:19:34.268
He killed your blood,

01:19:35.604 --> 01:19:36.979
your uncle,

01:19:37.564 --> 01:19:39.607
when he tried to kill you.

01:19:48.492 --> 01:19:50.701
- No.
- No?

01:19:53.997 --> 01:19:56.123
You want that I should let him go?

01:19:58.502 --> 01:20:01.837
- No, I...
- "No, no, I ..."

01:20:04.716 --> 01:20:06.383
You do want him dead.

01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:07.718
You just

01:20:09.387 --> 01:20:11.680
don't want to have to do it yourself.

01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:18.354
So,

01:20:20.190 --> 01:20:21.899
we will do this together.

01:20:26.530 --> 01:20:28.948
This will be

01:20:31.034 --> 01:20:32.743
a bonding experience.

01:20:38.583 --> 01:20:41.627
You know you can stop this
anytime that you want.

01:20:41.795 --> 01:20:43.754
But I don't think that you do.

01:20:44.130 --> 01:20:45.548
Just say the word.

01:20:47.092 --> 01:20:49.760
Say "stop."

01:21:03.650 --> 01:21:04.775
Stop.

01:21:14.953 --> 01:21:17.329
I will get you another room, my friend.

01:21:18.415 --> 01:21:20.332
With a much nicer view.

01:21:53.366 --> 01:21:55.743
He ordered you brown-brown, Mr. Yuri.

01:21:59.664 --> 01:22:01.790
- What?
- Brown-brown.

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:04.668
- What is it?
- It's a mixture of cocaine

01:22:06.296 --> 01:22:07.796
and gunpowder.

01:22:09.007 --> 01:22:11.175
They give it to the young boys
before they do battle.

01:22:11.217 --> 01:22:12.801
They do anything.

01:22:14.763 --> 01:22:16.347
Some other time.

01:22:16.514 --> 01:22:19.892
I suggest you try it at
least once, Mr. Yuri.

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:22.019
Why?

01:22:22.395 --> 01:22:24.980
Because it's your gunpowder.

01:22:40.872 --> 01:22:42.206
All right.

01:22:47.545 --> 01:22:48.963
Even before that night

01:22:49.047 --> 01:22:51.799
I started doing a lot of cocaine
in West Africa.

01:22:52.217 --> 01:22:54.718
I'd never tried brown-brown before.

01:22:54.761 --> 01:22:57.054
But then I never killed a man, either.

01:23:00.934 --> 01:23:02.726
Here we go. Come on!

01:23:21.997 --> 01:23:24.081
Oh, I didn't do anything, did I?

01:23:31.589 --> 01:23:34.341
Wait, are you sick? SIDA?

01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.343
AIDS?

01:23:38.096 --> 01:23:40.681
Ask the white man. He will know.

01:23:41.349 --> 01:23:43.475
Sir, will my hand grow back?

01:23:52.610 --> 01:23:54.903
- Simeon?
- Remember, Yuri.

01:23:55.864 --> 01:23:57.239
Take sides.

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:01.744
Simeon!

01:24:05.165 --> 01:24:06.749
Don't! He's Andre's.

01:24:06.791 --> 01:24:09.877
- Fuck Andre.
- Yeah, fuck Andre.

01:24:12.964 --> 01:24:15.257
I'm sorry, they don't usually do that.

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:19.887
Well, let me look at it.
Maybe I can fix it.

01:24:19.971 --> 01:24:22.681
Let me see it. It's the magazine.
Give it to me.

01:24:24.476 --> 01:24:25.726
Fuck you!

01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:53.837
I started to feel I'd been cursed.

01:24:54.464 --> 01:24:56.423
The curse of invincibility.

01:25:01.012 --> 01:25:02.679
Nicki, please go to your room.

01:25:06.684 --> 01:25:08.477
I don't believe you.

01:25:09.312 --> 01:25:11.313
Can you prove any of this?

01:25:12.232 --> 01:25:16.693
Mr. Orlov goes to a lot of trouble
to make his business look legitimate.

01:25:17.195 --> 01:25:20.197
Even to you. Perhaps, especially to you.

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:23.742
I don't expect
we're gonna find anything here today.

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:25.661
So, what do you want?

01:25:27.914 --> 01:25:29.873
I was hoping that you would help me.

01:25:37.382 --> 01:25:39.007
I understand that

01:25:40.343 --> 01:25:42.553
your parents died tragically.

01:25:47.142 --> 01:25:50.102
The illegal firearms
used to murder your mother and father

01:25:50.436 --> 01:25:53.272
were procured from men
exactly like your husband.

01:25:56.025 --> 01:25:57.609
I'd like you to leave.

01:26:01.239 --> 01:26:02.865
Okay. Gentlemen.

01:26:18.715 --> 01:26:19.798
Ava?

01:26:29.434 --> 01:26:30.934
Ava, what's wrong?

01:26:32.437 --> 01:26:34.146
I can't wear the clothes.

01:26:35.231 --> 01:26:37.232
I can't wear the jewelry.

01:26:38.776 --> 01:26:40.611
Can't drive the car.

01:26:42.822 --> 01:26:44.698
Can't live in this house.

01:26:44.949 --> 01:26:46.950
Everything's got blood on it.

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:48.452
Blood on it?

01:26:50.788 --> 01:26:52.581
What's the matter with you?

01:26:56.628 --> 01:26:58.462
Don't be so melodramatic.

01:26:58.504 --> 01:27:01.965
Of course I'm melodramatic.
I'm a failed actress, remember?

01:27:10.975 --> 01:27:13.560
I told you, these people, it's political.

01:27:13.645 --> 01:27:15.520
They lie. They're liars.

01:27:15.688 --> 01:27:18.815
Look at me. Look. They lie
to make themselves look good, okay?

01:27:18.900 --> 01:27:21.985
- You can't trust them.
- It's not just them.

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:28.158
Don't worry.
Your family didn't say anything.

01:27:28.826 --> 01:27:30.577
They didn't have to.

01:27:32.789 --> 01:27:37.000
I sell people a means
to defend themselves, Ava.

01:27:37.168 --> 01:27:38.168
That's all.

01:27:38.253 --> 01:27:41.546
Yuri, I see the news. I see those pictures.

01:27:42.465 --> 01:27:43.590
The guns are bigger than the boys.

01:27:43.675 --> 01:27:46.510
There is nothing illegal about what I do!

01:27:46.552 --> 01:27:48.345
I don't care if it's legal!

01:27:49.055 --> 01:27:50.180
It's wrong!

01:28:10.034 --> 01:28:11.702
Please stop.

01:28:15.206 --> 01:28:16.915
It makes no difference if I stop.

01:28:18.084 --> 01:28:20.085
Someone will take my place the next day.

01:28:20.169 --> 01:28:23.046
So let them. We have enough.

01:28:24.757 --> 01:28:26.550
It's not about the money.

01:28:28.469 --> 01:28:30.053
Then what is it?

01:28:34.392 --> 01:28:35.934
I'm good at it.

01:28:46.487 --> 01:28:49.573
I feel like all I've done my whole life
is be pretty.

01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:51.783
I mean,

01:28:53.161 --> 01:28:55.162
all I've done is be born.

01:28:56.205 --> 01:28:59.750
I'm a failed actress, a failed artist.

01:29:00.585 --> 01:29:02.544
I'm not much good as a mother.

01:29:05.256 --> 01:29:08.300
Come to think of it,
I'm not even that pretty anymore.

01:29:11.596 --> 01:29:14.890
I have failed at everything, Yuri.

01:29:17.185 --> 01:29:19.603
But I won't fail as a human being.

01:29:24.609 --> 01:29:28.111
My enemies had finally found a weapon
that could hurt me.

01:29:29.739 --> 01:29:32.949
For the next six months I stopped
running guns. I went legitimate.

01:29:32.992 --> 01:29:34.701
This is an untapped market.

01:29:34.786 --> 01:29:38.789
I'm talking over five million cubic meters
of timber in the first year alone.

01:29:38.831 --> 01:29:40.999
Over 100 exploitable species.

01:29:41.084 --> 01:29:43.585
The oil? Between you and me,
this is the new Texas.

01:29:43.628 --> 01:29:46.338
What do you say to 10,000 barrels a month?

01:29:46.756 --> 01:29:48.382
He must be lying.

01:29:49.258 --> 01:29:50.675
He's talking.

01:29:50.760 --> 01:29:54.137
Listen, there are gas reserves off the
Ivory Coast that OPEC doesn't know about.

01:29:54.180 --> 01:29:56.223
The phone numbers all check out.

01:29:58.267 --> 01:29:59.810
It's all on the level.

01:30:01.145 --> 01:30:02.896
No wonder Valentine was confused.

01:30:17.328 --> 01:30:21.331
Thank God there are still legal ways
to exploit developing countries.

01:30:21.416 --> 01:30:25.335
But the only problem with an honest buck
is they're so hard to make.

01:30:25.378 --> 01:30:28.797
The margins are too low.
Too many people are doing it.

01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:35.887
Still, I'd promised Ava.

01:30:45.022 --> 01:30:47.774
Yuri, the President of Liberia
is on his way up.

01:30:50.194 --> 01:30:51.278
He's early.

01:30:52.738 --> 01:30:54.781
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Okay.

01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:03.206
What the fuck are you doing here, Andre?

01:31:03.291 --> 01:31:05.208
We are here for peace talks
at the United Nations.

01:31:05.293 --> 01:31:07.878
So at the same time you thought
you'd drop in on your arms dealer?

01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:11.381
Well, I was beginning to wonder
whether that was still your profession.

01:31:11.507 --> 01:31:13.925
You know you're a hard man
to get a hold of all of a sudden.

01:31:14.886 --> 01:31:16.261
That is a shame.

01:31:16.554 --> 01:31:19.806
My son and I,
we were hoping to do a little shopping

01:31:20.349 --> 01:31:22.726
- while we are here in New York.
- You know they're watching you.

01:31:22.810 --> 01:31:24.603
Yes, I know they blame me.

01:31:24.687 --> 01:31:27.189
They blame me for everything,
those hypocrites.

01:31:27.231 --> 01:31:30.150
- They're on a hunt for a witch.
- Witch-hunt.

01:31:30.568 --> 01:31:32.444
Hostilities have escalated.

01:31:33.154 --> 01:31:36.114
They are making it very difficult
for me to re-supply.

01:31:36.574 --> 01:31:41.077
That requires a man of your rare ingenuity.

01:31:44.081 --> 01:31:45.582
I can't help you. I'm sorry.

01:31:52.924 --> 01:31:54.257
I understand.

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:57.928
But you should know this.

01:31:58.054 --> 01:32:00.764
Due to our present situation
we are compelled

01:32:01.599 --> 01:32:03.475
to be unusually generous.

01:32:08.773 --> 01:32:10.398
So see you soon,

01:32:11.567 --> 01:32:12.943
Lord of War.

01:32:16.739 --> 01:32:19.658
You still haven't brought me
the gun of Rambo.

01:32:36.467 --> 01:32:41.179
At four and a half months old
a human fetus has a reptile's tail,

01:32:41.347 --> 01:32:43.306
a remnant of our evolution.

01:32:43.474 --> 01:32:45.517
Maybe that's what I couldn't escape.

01:32:45.601 --> 01:32:47.894
You can fight a lot of enemies and survive.

01:32:47.979 --> 01:32:51.064
But if you fight your biology
you will always lose.

01:32:51.148 --> 01:32:54.442
You guys aren't waiting to say goodbye?
I'm not leaving for another 10 minutes.

01:32:54.485 --> 01:32:56.987
- Sorry, Nicki has swim practice.
- Oh, okay.

01:32:57.488 --> 01:32:59.364
You know, I'm kind of glad you're going.

01:32:59.448 --> 01:33:02.284
You've been here so long
you're starting to get on my nerves.

01:33:02.326 --> 01:33:04.536
This oil concession
should be wrapped up by Thursday.

01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:06.955
I'll be back for the weekend.
We'll go somewhere.

01:33:06.998 --> 01:33:09.165
- The sea.
- That would be fun.

01:33:10.334 --> 01:33:11.835
- Come on.
- Hey.

01:33:12.712 --> 01:33:14.504
You trust me, right?

01:33:16.424 --> 01:33:17.924
She looked me directly in the eye

01:33:18.009 --> 01:33:20.802
the way I've looked in the eyes
of a thousand customs officials,

01:33:20.845 --> 01:33:23.430
government bureaucrats
and law enforcement agents.

01:33:23.514 --> 01:33:25.682
Yes, I trust you.

01:33:25.808 --> 01:33:27.934
And she lied without flinching.

01:33:28.477 --> 01:33:31.396
- I'll see you, big guy.
- Bye, Papa.

01:33:32.273 --> 01:33:33.773
She learned from the best.

01:33:33.858 --> 01:33:35.317
Have a good trip.

01:33:52.251 --> 01:33:53.543
That's him.

01:34:14.357 --> 01:34:17.150
- Where are we going, Mama?
- It's a game, honey.

01:34:17.276 --> 01:34:19.069
Like hide and seek?

01:34:19.737 --> 01:34:20.820
Yes.

01:34:22.490 --> 01:34:24.240
Like hide and seek.

01:34:45.054 --> 01:34:48.848
I can always sense when I'm being tailed.
I know what to look for.

01:34:49.058 --> 01:34:51.810
But then I'd never been tailed
by the woman I love.

01:35:04.532 --> 01:35:06.616
I can put myself in Ava's place.

01:35:06.992 --> 01:35:09.828
She might have understood
if the combination was the last four digits

01:35:09.912 --> 01:35:12.706
of my social security number,
my birthday, even her birthday.

01:35:12.790 --> 01:35:14.290
But not Nicolai's.

01:35:30.558 --> 01:35:33.476
My son's birthday unlocked
what the government would later describe

01:35:33.561 --> 01:35:35.311
as "a catalog of carnage."

01:35:35.396 --> 01:35:37.313
Honey, come over here.

01:35:45.906 --> 01:35:47.532
Nicki, stay right here.

01:36:50.763 --> 01:36:52.305
Come on, Nicki.

01:37:05.319 --> 01:37:08.947
- Come to see how the other half lives?
- I miss your borscht.

01:37:09.114 --> 01:37:11.741
- Mom and Dad say you're clean.
- Yeah, you, too.

01:37:13.452 --> 01:37:16.538
You went legit, huh?
That's hard to believe.

01:37:17.081 --> 01:37:18.998
That's because it's not true.

01:37:21.043 --> 01:37:23.837
Only you know.
I'm leaving tonight on a job.

01:37:23.921 --> 01:37:25.421
I want you to come.

01:37:26.757 --> 01:37:27.966
I can't.

01:37:29.969 --> 01:37:33.429
I've got a girlfriend.
I think she might be the one.

01:37:34.723 --> 01:37:37.183
Plus I'm thinking of opening my own place.

01:37:37.601 --> 01:37:40.311
Maybe this trip will help. It's good money.

01:37:43.232 --> 01:37:44.440
Yuri,

01:37:46.026 --> 01:37:47.402
I've given my word.

01:37:47.444 --> 01:37:51.322
No one has to know. We'll tell
them we're going for a little R&R.

01:37:54.743 --> 01:37:56.578
What do you need me for all of a sudden?

01:37:56.620 --> 01:37:58.329
West Africa's fucked up.

01:37:58.998 --> 01:38:00.456
More than usual.

01:38:01.375 --> 01:38:02.959
I can't trust anybody.

01:38:06.213 --> 01:38:08.256
I need you to watch my back.

01:38:11.315 --> 01:38:13.872
Brothers In Arms.

01:38:24.646 --> 01:38:29.949
Monrovia, Liberia - 2001

01:38:47.004 --> 01:38:48.171
Yuri.

01:38:50.466 --> 01:38:51.966
Welcome back.

01:38:53.636 --> 01:38:55.178
Welcome, both of you.

01:38:55.387 --> 01:38:57.138
Welcome to democracy.

01:38:57.264 --> 01:38:59.390
Democracy?
What have you been drinking, Andy?

01:38:59.975 --> 01:39:01.768
You have not seen the news.

01:39:01.894 --> 01:39:04.270
You know,
they accuse me of rigging elections.

01:39:04.355 --> 01:39:05.480
But after this,

01:39:06.857 --> 01:39:08.858
with your Florida
and your Supreme Court of kangaroos,

01:39:08.901 --> 01:39:11.945
now the US must shut up forever.

01:39:16.700 --> 01:39:18.868
How do you do this, Yuri, huh?

01:39:20.037 --> 01:39:24.082
How do you do this
when they are watching all of my airspace?

01:39:24.917 --> 01:39:27.210
Where there's a will there's a weapon.

01:39:28.212 --> 01:39:30.380
Come on, where's my fucking money?

01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:36.177
When it is delivered.

01:39:38.222 --> 01:39:40.765
- It is delivered.
- This is not for me.

01:39:41.058 --> 01:39:43.351
This is for my neighbors to the west.

01:39:43.435 --> 01:39:44.727
The west?

01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:47.689
We're going to Sierra Leone.

01:39:47.731 --> 01:39:49.941
Oh, yes. And my son,

01:39:50.359 --> 01:39:53.903
Baptiste Jr. will go with you
to make the proper introductions.

01:39:54.488 --> 01:39:55.822
We have no trucks.

01:39:56.699 --> 01:40:00.910
You will,
as soon as we get the food out of them.

01:40:06.166 --> 01:40:07.750
The gun of Rambo.

01:40:08.252 --> 01:40:11.004
Mr. Yuri, you are a man of your word.

01:40:11.588 --> 01:40:13.047
So, where are we going?

01:40:13.382 --> 01:40:16.884
RUF. The Freedom Fighters.

01:40:18.012 --> 01:40:21.472
Every faction in Africa
calls themselves by these noble names.

01:40:21.557 --> 01:40:23.599
Liberation-this, Patriotic-that,

01:40:23.684 --> 01:40:25.893
Democratic Republic of something-or-other.

01:40:25.936 --> 01:40:29.647
Yeah!

01:40:29.732 --> 01:40:32.358
I guess they can't own up
to what they usually are,

01:40:32.443 --> 01:40:35.987
Federation of Worse Oppressors
Than the Last Bunch of Oppressors.

01:40:42.828 --> 01:40:44.912
Often, the most barbaric atrocities occur

01:40:44.955 --> 01:40:48.207
when both combatants
proclaim themselves freedom fighters.

01:40:54.214 --> 01:40:57.425
Right, I've got 500 units, brand new

01:40:57.468 --> 01:40:59.469
right out of the box all as clean as this.

01:40:59.553 --> 01:41:01.012
What have you got?

01:41:18.655 --> 01:41:20.698
God! Oh, Jesus.

01:41:25.370 --> 01:41:26.662
Oh, Jesus.

01:41:30.125 --> 01:41:32.251
Yuri, I need to talk to you.

01:41:32.336 --> 01:41:34.337
- Not now.
- Now.

01:41:36.507 --> 01:41:37.840
Excuse me.

01:41:45.516 --> 01:41:46.599
What?

01:41:47.726 --> 01:41:50.186
- We can't do this deal.
- The fuck we can't.

01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:53.689
- What's the matter with you?
- Look. Look over there.

01:41:53.732 --> 01:41:56.776
As soon as we hand over the guns
those people are going to die.

01:41:58.070 --> 01:42:00.404
It's not our business.

01:42:01.949 --> 01:42:04.075
They killed a boy just now
as young as Nicki.

01:42:08.872 --> 01:42:12.875
- What is the hold-up?
- There is no hold-up. I'll be right there.

01:42:13.377 --> 01:42:16.295
Vitaly, it's what we always know.
We can't control what they do.

01:42:16.380 --> 01:42:18.965
No, no, today we can.

01:42:19.049 --> 01:42:20.967
Today we can. Yuri, they're right there!

01:42:21.051 --> 01:42:24.178
What do you think they'll do to us
if we back out? They'll kill us.

01:42:24.304 --> 01:42:26.556
And if we go ahead,
what do you think they'll do to them?

01:42:31.979 --> 01:42:33.771
We got to do something.

01:42:35.020 --> 01:42:36.448
Please, for fuck's sake.

01:42:36.488 --> 01:42:37.616
It's not our fight.

01:42:37.856 --> 01:42:40.323
Please. Brothers In Arms.

01:42:42.072 --> 01:42:43.573
What is he saying?

01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:45.741
It's the deal.

01:42:45.909 --> 01:42:49.453
My brother's not happy with the terms,
but we're working it out. It's nothing.

01:42:58.130 --> 01:42:59.881
Right? It's nothing.

01:43:06.346 --> 01:43:09.265
Yeah, nothing.

01:43:11.435 --> 01:43:13.519
You're right, Yuri. You're right.

01:43:14.563 --> 01:43:16.856
God, I've got to get my shit together.

01:43:18.066 --> 01:43:20.735
- This is not our fight.
- Right.

01:43:21.069 --> 01:43:24.155
Okay, what's the deal? 300 RPGs,

01:43:24.281 --> 01:43:27.950
500 assault rifles and 800 grenades.

01:43:30.287 --> 01:43:32.705
I thought it was 1,200 grenades.

01:43:35.834 --> 01:43:37.501
I was so caught up in the deal

01:43:37.586 --> 01:43:40.129
I never realized what was going on
in Vitaly's head.

01:43:40.214 --> 01:43:43.674
I thought it was 1,200 grenades. Confused.

01:43:44.051 --> 01:43:45.051
Come to think about it,

01:43:45.135 --> 01:43:48.304
maybe I never understood
what was going on in his head.

01:43:52.476 --> 01:43:55.269
I beg your pardon.
May I see another stone?

01:43:55.646 --> 01:43:58.064
One thing I do understand for certain

01:43:58.565 --> 01:44:01.400
is that Vitaly broke the cardinal rule
of gunrunning.

01:44:02.152 --> 01:44:04.862
Never pick up a gun
and join the customers.

01:44:11.995 --> 01:44:13.704
What are you doing?

01:44:17.501 --> 01:44:18.960
Something for Yuri.

01:44:20.254 --> 01:44:22.505
Step away. Slow.

01:44:41.024 --> 01:44:46.320
No, Vit!

01:46:12.407 --> 01:46:16.702
Only half the guns were gone so I was
still entitled to half the diamonds.

01:46:17.537 --> 01:46:19.455
If I took them, I was lost.

01:46:19.873 --> 01:46:21.832
If I left them, I was lost.

01:46:30.425 --> 01:46:33.803
The massacre played out
exactly how Vitaly predicted.

01:46:33.845 --> 01:46:38.182
But then a half dozen other massacres
happened in Sierra Leone that week.

01:46:38.308 --> 01:46:39.975
You can't stop them all.

01:46:40.060 --> 01:46:42.853
In my experience,
you can't stop any of them.

01:46:44.648 --> 01:46:48.317
They say,
"Evil prevails when good men fail to act."

01:46:48.402 --> 01:46:52.238
What they ought to say is, "Evil prevails."

01:47:06.336 --> 01:47:08.254
I now shared even more in common

01:47:08.338 --> 01:47:11.674
with the leader of that country
God seemed to have forsaken.

01:47:11.716 --> 01:47:14.802
We saw something in each other
neither one of us liked.

01:47:15.011 --> 01:47:17.304
Or maybe,
we were just looking in the mirror.

01:47:37.701 --> 01:47:41.954
I'd paid a Monrovian doctor $20
to remove the lead from Vitaly's body

01:47:42.038 --> 01:47:44.206
and write a bogus death certificate.

01:47:45.041 --> 01:47:46.792
I should have paid more.

01:47:46.877 --> 01:47:49.128
I've smuggled millions of rounds
of ammunition,

01:47:49.212 --> 01:47:53.299
and the bullet that lands me in jail
is found under my dead brother's rib.

01:47:55.302 --> 01:47:56.677
Yuri Orlov.

01:47:57.220 --> 01:48:00.222
We're with the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms.

01:48:00.265 --> 01:48:03.309
Let me guess. This isn't about
the alcohol or the tobacco.

01:48:45.644 --> 01:48:48.062
- Crimean Restaurant.
- Papa?

01:48:55.487 --> 01:48:57.488
Both my sons are dead.

01:49:01.076 --> 01:49:03.285
There are only two tragedies in life.

01:49:03.828 --> 01:49:07.331
One is not getting what you want.
The other is getting it.

01:49:07.666 --> 01:49:08.749
Is this one of yours?

01:49:08.792 --> 01:49:11.627
Jack Valentine finally had what he wanted.

01:49:11.795 --> 01:49:16.048
Curiously, the death certificate
says he died of heart failure.

01:49:17.133 --> 01:49:18.884
Falsifying a death certificate?

01:49:19.636 --> 01:49:21.053
That's not going to hold me.

01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:25.099
You're right. As usual, you are right.

01:49:27.894 --> 01:49:29.812
Have you seen today's paper?

01:49:37.571 --> 01:49:39.154
Fake end-user certificates.

01:49:39.197 --> 01:49:41.657
Cut-out companies,
meticulously catalogued.

01:49:42.492 --> 01:49:46.036
There is hardly a warlord,
dictator or despot

01:49:46.121 --> 01:49:49.164
anywhere in the world that you're not
on a first-name basis with.

01:49:49.249 --> 01:49:51.750
It was your wife, your trophy-wife,

01:49:52.419 --> 01:49:54.420
that led us to the prize.

01:49:55.005 --> 01:49:57.506
It's not her fault.
She's just easier to follow than you are.

01:50:00.010 --> 01:50:01.051
May I?

01:50:01.761 --> 01:50:03.304
Yeah, go ahead.

01:50:28.038 --> 01:50:29.204
Enjoy it.

01:50:30.081 --> 01:50:31.707
- What?
- This.

01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:37.004
Tell me I'm everything you despise.
That I'm the personification of evil.

01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:38.881
That I'm, what,

01:50:38.965 --> 01:50:43.052
responsible for the breakdown
of the fabric of society and world order.

01:50:43.678 --> 01:50:45.554
I'm a one-man genocide.

01:50:46.598 --> 01:50:50.517
Say everything you want to say to me now.
'Cause you don't have long.

01:50:51.269 --> 01:50:52.978
Are you paying attention?

01:50:53.980 --> 01:50:55.856
Or are you delusional?

01:50:56.441 --> 01:50:59.777
You have broken
every arms embargo written.

01:50:59.986 --> 01:51:01.570
There is enough evidence here

01:51:01.655 --> 01:51:04.406
to put you away
for consecutive life sentences.

01:51:04.449 --> 01:51:06.450
You are going to spend
the next 10 years of your life

01:51:06.534 --> 01:51:10.954
going from a cell to a courtroom
before you even start serving your time.

01:51:13.917 --> 01:51:17.920
I don't think you fully appreciate
the seriousness of your situation.

01:51:28.223 --> 01:51:30.432
My family has disowned me.

01:51:32.602 --> 01:51:34.770
My wife and son have left me.

01:51:38.274 --> 01:51:39.942
My brother's dead.

01:51:40.944 --> 01:51:45.447
Trust me, I fully appreciate
the seriousness of my situation.

01:51:46.116 --> 01:51:47.783
But I promise you,

01:51:48.368 --> 01:51:50.786
I won't spend a single second
in a courtroom.

01:51:52.288 --> 01:51:53.831
You are delusional.

01:51:54.457 --> 01:51:56.041
I like you, Jack.

01:51:56.918 --> 01:52:00.045
Well, maybe not, but I understand you.

01:52:04.134 --> 01:52:06.301
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

01:52:07.387 --> 01:52:09.888
This way you can prepare yourself.

01:52:14.477 --> 01:52:15.602
Okay.

01:52:15.645 --> 01:52:18.981
Soon there's gonna be a knock on that
door and you will be called outside.

01:52:19.065 --> 01:52:21.608
In the hall
there will be a man who outranks you.

01:52:21.651 --> 01:52:24.820
First, he'll compliment you
on the fine job you've done,

01:52:24.863 --> 01:52:27.239
that you're making the world a safer place,

01:52:27.323 --> 01:52:30.784
that you're to receive a commendation
and a promotion.

01:52:31.828 --> 01:52:34.538
And then he's going to tell you
that I am to be released.

01:52:34.622 --> 01:52:36.331
You're going to protest.

01:52:37.167 --> 01:52:39.501
You'll probably threaten to resign.

01:52:40.086 --> 01:52:42.504
But in the end I will be released.

01:52:43.339 --> 01:52:44.506
The reason I'll be released

01:52:44.591 --> 01:52:47.384
is the same reason
you think I'll be convicted.

01:52:47.969 --> 01:52:50.888
I do rub shoulders
with some of the most vile,

01:52:50.972 --> 01:52:53.849
sadistic men
calling themselves leaders today.

01:52:55.310 --> 01:52:57.102
But some of those men

01:52:58.396 --> 01:53:00.981
are the enemies of your enemies.

01:53:02.776 --> 01:53:06.069
And while the biggest arms dealer
in the world is your boss,

01:53:06.821 --> 01:53:08.822
the President of the United States,

01:53:08.865 --> 01:53:12.201
who ships more merchandise in a day
than I do in a year,

01:53:13.661 --> 01:53:17.539
sometimes it's embarrassing
to have his fingerprints on the guns.

01:53:18.333 --> 01:53:21.126
Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me

01:53:21.336 --> 01:53:24.087
to supply forces
he can't be seen supplying.

01:53:24.589 --> 01:53:25.714
So,

01:53:27.342 --> 01:53:29.676
you call me evil.

01:53:30.970 --> 01:53:35.182
But unfortunately for you,
I'm a necessary evil.

01:53:51.783 --> 01:53:53.909
I would tell you to go to hell,

01:53:55.370 --> 01:53:57.120
but I think you're already there.

01:54:31.865 --> 01:54:33.949
Pleasure doing business with you.

01:54:34.284 --> 01:54:36.910
Most people are happy
just to get out of jail.

01:54:36.953 --> 01:54:39.162
I expect to be paid to leave.

01:54:39.539 --> 01:54:40.831
I'm not a fool.

01:54:40.915 --> 01:54:43.000
I know that just because
they needed me that day

01:54:43.084 --> 01:54:45.836
didn't mean they wouldn't make me
a scapegoat the next.

01:54:45.920 --> 01:54:49.464
But I was back doing what I do best.

01:54:49.698 --> 01:54:51.216
Umbrellas to the Sahara?

01:54:51.456 --> 01:54:53.084
Sun Umbrellas.

01:55:12.322 --> 01:55:14.823
You know who's going to inherit the Earth?

01:55:14.908 --> 01:55:16.283
Arms dealers.

01:55:16.492 --> 01:55:19.494
Because everyone else
is too busy killing each other.

01:55:19.871 --> 01:55:21.872
That's the secret to survival.

01:55:22.248 --> 01:55:23.832
Never go to war.

01:55:27.295 --> 01:55:29.004
Especially with yourself.
