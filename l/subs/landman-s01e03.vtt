[groans] Look, Monty,

04:33.874 --> 04:36.543
you have an employee
who failed to report theft

04:36.544 --> 04:39.447
of an asset worth
$7 million dollars.

04:39.580 --> 04:42.583
That asset was used
to move illegal drugs

04:42.683 --> 04:45.118
when it landed illegally again
on a public roadway.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.753
Road was private.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.756
It's an easement with multiple
lessors having access.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.758
In a court of law,
that makes it public.

04:50.858 --> 04:53.827
You got a pumpjack
with numerous OSHA violations,

04:53.961 --> 04:57.096

more OSHA regulations

04:57.097 --> 04:58.999

04:59.132 --> 05:01.635
Now, something
like this happens again--

05:01.735 --> 05:03.837
and it will--
you'll be negligent

05:03.937 --> 05:05.673

against an employee

05:05.806 --> 05:07.941

every rule he came across.

05:08.041 --> 05:11.178

policy, making you--

05:11.278 --> 05:13.013

05:13.113 --> 05:15.048

05:16.450 --> 05:17.851

five trucks stolen.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.323
I'm not talking pickup trucks
either, I'm talking oil tankers.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.559
They just disappear one day.

05:25.659 --> 05:28.529
And then a couple weeks later,
they mysteriously return.

05:28.662 --> 05:29.796
And that's just me.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.465
Multiply that by 500.

You want to see the price of oil
go up $30 a barrel?
