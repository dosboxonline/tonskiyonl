00:06.083 --> 00:08.458
[Annatar] <i>The Greatest of Elven-smiths
is consumed by his work.</i>

00:08.458 --> 00:12.250
He asks that I handle all matters
of administration in his stead.

00:12.250 --> 00:13.958
I'm just fatigued.

00:13.958 --> 00:16.500
You are the Lord of Eregion.
You have responsibilities.

00:16.500 --> 00:19.000
Until the Nine are complete,
nothing else matters.

00:19.125 --> 00:22.000
[Annatar] Without <i>mithril,</i> the remaining
Rings of Power may never be complete.

00:22.000 --> 00:23.458
We need more.

00:23.458 --> 00:24.708
The answer is no.

00:25.333 --> 00:27.250
Tell Narvi we're expanding the dig.

00:27.250 --> 00:28.375
Have you gone mad?

00:28.375 --> 00:29.666
Take off the Ring.

00:29.666 --> 00:32.916
I have nothing to prove to you, boy.

00:33.041 --> 00:35.000
- [grunts]
- [Prince Durin IV groans]

00:35.791 --> 00:39.125
We'll lay our bodies in front of that mine
ourselves if we have to.

00:39.125 --> 00:40.041
[Narvi] Disa?

00:41.500 --> 00:43.208
[Elrond] <i>The Orcs are not in Mordor.</i>

00:43.208 --> 00:45.583
<i>A legion of them are headed for Eregion.</i>

00:46.750 --> 00:48.333
<i>Galadriel was right.</i>

00:48.333 --> 00:49.750
You must send aid!

00:49.750 --> 00:54.791
Our armies cannot defeat both Adar
and Sauron. Not alone.

00:55.416 --> 00:56.875
[Orcs laughing]

00:56.875 --> 00:58.375
[Adar, in Sindarin] I brought you here.

00:58.375 --> 01:00.291
For we share a common enemy.

01:01.250 --> 01:04.708
[Galadriel, in English] <i>Elrond hastens
from Lindon with an army of Elves.</i>

01:04.708 --> 01:07.333
And Nenya, my Ring.

01:07.333 --> 01:10.083
[Adar] <i>Sauron believes he is still
beyond my grasp.</i>

01:10.083 --> 01:12.458
But I know he hides in Eregion.

01:14.500 --> 01:15.750
How fares your progress?

01:15.750 --> 01:19.333
[Celebrimbor] <i>I cannot forge
more Rings without</i> mithril.

01:19.333 --> 01:20.750
[Annatar] <i>I have been to Khazad-dûm.</i>

01:20.750 --> 01:22.375
One-ninth portion.

01:22.375 --> 01:23.833
It should be enough.

01:25.583 --> 01:28.041
[Galadriel] <i>Sauron has no army of his own,</i>

01:28.041 --> 01:30.708
<i>so he's lured yours here instead.</i>

01:30.708 --> 01:32.750
<i>He wants you to attack Eregion.</i>

01:32.750 --> 01:34.333
[Adar] <i>Eregion will fall.</i>

01:34.333 --> 01:35.541
And Sauron with it.

01:35.541 --> 01:36.541
Bind her.

01:36.541 --> 01:37.875
No!

01:37.875 --> 01:39.583
<i>This is what Sauron wants!</i>

01:40.833 --> 01:43.375
[bellows]

01:44.791 --> 01:46.791
[Orc shouts]

01:54.875 --> 01:57.875
[birds chirping]

02:07.750 --> 02:09.250
[sighs]

02:56.291 --> 02:57.583
Nine...

02:59.083 --> 03:00.208
[sighs]

03:00.208 --> 03:01.708
...for mortal Men.

03:08.958 --> 03:10.000
[sighs]

03:28.625 --> 03:30.541
[skittering, chittering]

03:34.250 --> 03:35.666
[chittering]

03:36.291 --> 03:37.833
Hello, Mr. Mouse.

03:38.166 --> 03:39.208
[chuckles]

03:48.625 --> 03:49.625
[gasps]

03:50.708 --> 03:51.958
Have you fallen?

03:55.333 --> 03:59.125
Come. The floor is hardly the place
for the Greatest of Elven-smiths.

03:59.125 --> 04:00.416
No, I... I, uh...

04:01.333 --> 04:02.250
[stammers]

04:03.375 --> 04:07.708
Fëanor's hammer is, is missing a--

04:10.041 --> 04:11.416
Missing a, a...

04:12.333 --> 04:14.375
You know how forgetful you can be.

04:16.583 --> 04:17.583
No, no.

04:20.208 --> 04:21.625
No, this was different.

04:23.458 --> 04:26.208
I trust you are not feeling
overwhelmed again?

04:27.541 --> 04:28.541
No.

04:30.291 --> 04:32.583
Quite the opposite, in fact.

04:34.500 --> 04:37.416
These past weeks,
I have felt such clarity,

04:37.416 --> 04:40.791
a focus that I have not known in years.

04:41.708 --> 04:43.458
And I have you to thank for that.

04:44.208 --> 04:45.208
Please.

04:45.791 --> 04:47.458
When the world is still,

04:49.708 --> 04:54.041
then the ideas can flow freely.

04:56.041 --> 05:01.666
My work is but to let them share
the secrets of their song.

05:06.666 --> 05:08.375
How fares your progress?

05:10.166 --> 05:11.166
[sighs]

05:13.291 --> 05:15.541
The Rings of Power are nearly complete.

05:18.833 --> 05:19.833
How long?

05:20.083 --> 05:21.083
[scoffs]

05:21.916 --> 05:23.541
What is another few days

05:23.541 --> 05:29.166
to perfect something
that shall last forever?

05:29.458 --> 05:30.458
[chuckles]

05:33.083 --> 05:35.250
It will be a sad occasion.

05:37.250 --> 05:39.041
I have so enjoyed our time together.

05:41.041 --> 05:42.791
Well, all things must end.

05:46.958 --> 05:50.791
A pity. Is it not?

06:00.708 --> 06:01.791
[door opens]

06:03.666 --> 06:04.791
[door closes]

06:06.666 --> 06:08.666
[dramatic music playing]

06:28.208 --> 06:29.666
[Orcs shouting]

06:42.250 --> 06:43.625
[in Black Speech] It is time.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.500
[Elves clamoring]

06:52.375 --> 06:53.375
[in English] My lord.

06:53.375 --> 06:55.208
What orders from Lord Celebrimbor?

06:55.208 --> 06:57.625
Lord Celebrimbor refuses
to permit a counter-attack.

06:58.416 --> 07:00.458
He says the river will protect us.

07:00.458 --> 07:02.708
Every moment we remain idle,
more Elves die.

07:02.708 --> 07:04.000
We must do something.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.791
And that is why
we're not going to obey him.

07:05.916 --> 07:07.041
[rumbling, explosions continue]

07:07.041 --> 07:08.458
Gather your finest troops.

07:09.791 --> 07:11.625
I am taking command of our defenses.

07:12.208 --> 07:14.333
- Valar bless you, my lord.
- [soldier] This way. Go!

07:14.333 --> 07:17.458
What is it? What are you not telling them?

07:19.833 --> 07:21.708
Celebrimbor's mind is gone.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.125
We are alone.

07:28.958 --> 07:29.958
[soldier] Quickly.

07:30.583 --> 07:32.000
Not alone.

07:38.375 --> 07:41.333
You have proven your quality, Mirdania.

07:43.083 --> 07:45.708
When the time comes,
I will see to it that you are...

07:45.708 --> 07:47.208
[rumbling, explosions stop]

07:47.208 --> 07:48.500
...duly rewarded.

07:49.208 --> 07:50.458
What is it?

07:50.458 --> 07:53.958
The siege engines. They've gone silent.

07:54.750 --> 07:56.083
[woman] Get to safety!

08:01.083 --> 08:03.500
[Orcs grunting]

08:05.500 --> 08:06.791
[Zhor] Push it!

08:06.791 --> 08:09.083
I said, push, you maggots.

08:09.083 --> 08:10.916
[Orcs grunting]

08:12.416 --> 08:14.708
Push, come on, you maggots!

08:15.625 --> 08:17.041
Come on, you filth.

08:17.750 --> 08:21.375
Put your stinkin' backs into it!

08:26.750 --> 08:28.833
He's turning them away from the city.

08:35.750 --> 08:37.916
Celebrimbor was more mistaken
than we knew.

08:39.833 --> 08:41.458
Prepare for ground assault.

08:42.250 --> 08:44.500
Ground assault? From across the river?

08:44.500 --> 08:45.625
[grunts]

08:57.625 --> 08:59.750
[distant explosions]

09:04.791 --> 09:05.791
[Zhor] Again!

09:14.875 --> 09:16.416
They're damming the river.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.750
Prepare for ground assault!

09:45.750 --> 09:47.416
[soldier] To your positions!

10:20.958 --> 10:23.041
- [chittering]
- [gasps]

10:47.750 --> 10:49.250
[Narvi] <i>Eregion is under siege.</i>

10:49.250 --> 10:52.625
The guards received that entreaty
from an Elf at the West-gate.

10:55.708 --> 10:57.916
Then they are more desperate
than we thought.

11:00.833 --> 11:04.708
I need the mine taken back, now.

11:04.708 --> 11:09.625
But, sire, your son is still down there.
And so is Princess--

11:09.625 --> 11:12.125
Every hour that we delay

11:13.291 --> 11:16.291
costs us unthinkable wealth.

11:18.916 --> 11:21.541
We must dig.

11:26.875 --> 11:27.875
Go!

11:33.875 --> 11:34.958
Here they come.

11:38.416 --> 11:40.416
Slow to learn, are you?

11:40.416 --> 11:43.458
Easy, lads. Just turn around.

11:45.250 --> 11:46.250
[Narvi] No.

11:56.125 --> 11:58.166
We stand with you.

11:58.833 --> 11:59.916
Down your axes.

12:02.000 --> 12:07.500
That Ring has taken the King's heart.
I will not let it take this mountain.

12:08.125 --> 12:09.500
We have to get it off him.

12:10.041 --> 12:12.291
Ours is not the only kingdom in peril.

12:13.500 --> 12:15.666
There's an Elf outside, wants your ear.

12:19.083 --> 12:20.083
Let him in.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.833
Well, we'll have to do it quietly.

12:23.833 --> 12:28.000
This particular Elf has been banished
from all Dwarven lands.

12:48.083 --> 12:49.083
Elrond.

12:51.208 --> 12:53.458
My heart sings to see you, old friend.

12:58.041 --> 13:02.708
You tidal-haired,
flowery-tongued flagpole.

13:02.708 --> 13:04.166
-"Tidal-haired"?
- Mm-hm!

13:09.208 --> 13:10.958
You've got some sand comin' here.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.875
Have you any idea what I've gone through
since you left?

13:15.875 --> 13:19.041
It can hardly be more eventful
than what's transpired with me.

13:22.750 --> 13:25.000
I'm about to overthrow my father.

13:39.041 --> 13:40.250
What've you got?

13:46.083 --> 13:47.083
Defeat.

13:50.250 --> 13:51.500
Without your aid.

13:53.041 --> 13:55.333
Thousands of lives are at hazard, Durin.

13:56.000 --> 13:57.708
Celebrimbor is among them.

14:00.333 --> 14:04.166
I know I ask too much of you, Durin,
but I need your axe, old friend.

14:06.375 --> 14:07.833
I need it now.

14:13.916 --> 14:16.291
[shouting, snarling]

14:19.041 --> 14:21.916
[Orcs shouting]

14:26.833 --> 14:28.500
Move it!

14:33.833 --> 14:36.208
[shouting]

14:39.541 --> 14:40.750
[arrows whooshing]

14:43.250 --> 14:44.833
[in Sindarin] Loose arrows!

14:47.958 --> 14:49.125
[groans]

15:06.291 --> 15:07.291
[groans]

15:19.291 --> 15:22.208
[grunting]

15:26.291 --> 15:28.458
[shouting]

15:32.458 --> 15:34.041
[in Sindarin] Hold fast!

15:34.041 --> 15:36.125
[in English] Captain, they have a Ravager.

15:38.666 --> 15:39.875
[Commander Malendol, in Sindarin]
Prepare to fire!

15:39.875 --> 15:41.416
We must stop that machine!

15:41.875 --> 15:43.291
[shouting]

15:46.625 --> 15:47.958
[groans]

15:50.208 --> 15:52.333
[grunting]

15:59.833 --> 16:01.708
The Rings. Are they finished?

16:01.708 --> 16:02.916
[shushing]

16:06.125 --> 16:07.041
Wait for it.

16:08.958 --> 16:09.958
Wait for what?

16:14.416 --> 16:17.041
[chittering]

16:27.458 --> 16:28.541
Captivating.

16:29.250 --> 16:30.541
It is a pattern.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.125
Do you not see? A cycle.

16:35.791 --> 16:38.875
Repeating itself at intervals
throughout the day.

16:38.875 --> 16:39.958
And there is more.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.208
Here.

16:43.250 --> 16:45.541
Look. The embers--

16:45.541 --> 16:47.625
Celebrimbor, whatever so
inspired this epiphany,

16:47.625 --> 16:49.458
I assure you, we have not the time for it.

16:49.458 --> 16:50.708
On the contrary,

16:52.541 --> 16:55.333
we would appear
to have all the time that we need.

17:00.875 --> 17:05.375
The candles...
have not burned an inch all day.

17:07.958 --> 17:09.375
You sought peace.

17:10.791 --> 17:12.625
I gave it to you.

17:13.625 --> 17:14.625
No.

17:15.916 --> 17:19.875
Whatever... Whatever this is,
this is hardly a gift.

17:23.416 --> 17:24.791
What have you done to me?

17:24.791 --> 17:25.875
Done to you?

17:27.166 --> 17:30.291
You welcomed my instruction.
You practically begged for it.

17:30.291 --> 17:34.166
Now, a... a mouse scurries by,
and you fly to pieces.

17:36.458 --> 17:37.458
Listen to yourself.

17:37.458 --> 17:39.416
[shouts] Oh, what have you done to me?

17:41.791 --> 17:44.791
No Emissary of the Valar would do this.

17:47.166 --> 17:50.625
[softly] Who are you... truly?

17:51.541 --> 17:53.791
I am the one keeping the storm at bay.

17:55.333 --> 17:57.750
Balancing the very sun above your head.

17:57.750 --> 18:02.250
All to give you this one chance
to prove your worth!

18:04.708 --> 18:07.500
Now, I want the Nine!

18:07.500 --> 18:08.750
No!

18:09.833 --> 18:12.625
[shattering]

18:12.625 --> 18:15.458
[explosions in distance]

18:23.000 --> 18:25.791
- [explosions]
- [Elves screaming]

18:26.708 --> 18:28.708
[melancholic music playing]

18:37.416 --> 18:40.416
[sobbing]

18:59.041 --> 19:01.666
[gasping]

19:08.208 --> 19:10.041
[sobbing]

19:17.166 --> 19:19.208
[sobbing]

19:33.750 --> 19:34.833
What...

19:37.916 --> 19:39.416
[gasping]

19:41.833 --> 19:44.125
[wailing]

19:44.125 --> 19:45.291
[clatters]

19:45.583 --> 19:47.333
What... The <i>mithril.</i>

19:47.916 --> 19:49.000
[gasps]

19:50.666 --> 19:53.583
What... What is... What is this?

19:55.333 --> 20:00.208
I have learned so much from you,
since I came to Eregion.

20:01.833 --> 20:05.833
But no lesson more lasting than this.

20:07.791 --> 20:09.583
True creation...

20:13.208 --> 20:15.041
requires sacrifice.

20:22.083 --> 20:23.375
You are He.

20:25.541 --> 20:26.875
Are you not?

20:28.583 --> 20:30.833
- You are--
- I have many names.

20:41.125 --> 20:43.125
[Elves shouting]

20:49.375 --> 20:50.416
[groans]

20:55.083 --> 20:58.625
- [tinnitus ringing]
- [grunts]

21:10.166 --> 21:12.583
[all shouting]

21:18.333 --> 21:19.500
Mirdania!

21:23.208 --> 21:25.625
[panting] Thank the Valar you're alive.

21:25.625 --> 21:28.375
We have been deceived. All of us.

21:28.375 --> 21:31.541
He planned all of this,
to force me to forge the Rings.

21:31.541 --> 21:35.625
He put me in some kind of a prison.
A prison of the mind. But I am out.

21:36.458 --> 21:37.791
I am out.

21:37.791 --> 21:41.958
He must've been distracted by the siege,
so he forgot the ruby.

21:41.958 --> 21:44.791
And the mouse. The same mouse--

21:44.791 --> 21:46.166
And...

21:47.208 --> 21:49.416
You must... You must believe me.

21:50.125 --> 21:51.291
[gasping]

21:51.291 --> 21:53.083
You have to believe me!

21:53.708 --> 21:55.125
[Orcs grunting]

22:00.958 --> 22:02.958
This is the thinnest part of the wall.

22:05.541 --> 22:06.583
[Orc] Come on!

22:06.583 --> 22:09.458
[grunting]

22:11.666 --> 22:15.375
We have to brace the foundations!
Quickly, now!

22:22.541 --> 22:23.541
Seize him.

22:25.666 --> 22:27.041
He is Sauron.

22:28.958 --> 22:30.125
Seize him!

22:31.583 --> 22:34.916
He has been lying to you all along.

22:36.791 --> 22:39.291
No. He has been protecting us.

22:39.291 --> 22:42.166
While you've been in your tower,
giving orders that might have been

22:42.166 --> 22:43.250
the end of us all.

22:43.250 --> 22:45.791
No. No, that was him.

22:46.958 --> 22:48.541
He is Sauron!

22:50.208 --> 22:54.500
If you do not believe me, cut him open.

22:56.208 --> 22:58.416
Look at his hand, look at his blood.

22:59.125 --> 23:00.708
Black as pitch.

23:10.208 --> 23:12.916
[gasping]

23:14.000 --> 23:15.125
Come, my lord.

23:15.125 --> 23:17.125
Let's get you back where you belong.

23:17.125 --> 23:18.708
Get your hands off me!

23:18.708 --> 23:21.291
- [screaming]
- No!

23:24.750 --> 23:26.375
[gasping]

23:28.375 --> 23:29.375
[gasping]

23:29.375 --> 23:30.291
[grunts]

23:30.291 --> 23:31.666
[shudders]

23:44.000 --> 23:45.083
All this can end.

23:47.916 --> 23:52.125
Finish the Nine,
and I will spare your city.

23:57.125 --> 23:58.625
What will you do with them?

24:00.916 --> 24:04.083
Create a perfect and lasting peace.

24:09.458 --> 24:12.083
[horn bellows]

24:12.083 --> 24:14.875
[all shouting]

24:14.875 --> 24:19.958
[horn bellows]

24:20.791 --> 24:24.125
- [horn bellows]
- [horse neighing]

24:27.291 --> 24:28.875
[horses neighing]

24:35.000 --> 24:37.958
[shouting]

24:37.958 --> 24:39.291
Come on!

24:43.416 --> 24:45.958
[Orcs shouting]

25:16.125 --> 25:17.958
[in Sindarin] Death to our foes!

25:18.333 --> 25:20.541
[all shouting]

25:24.958 --> 25:27.458
[all shouting]

25:39.541 --> 25:41.500
[all shouting]

25:59.166 --> 26:01.250
[grunting]

26:29.458 --> 26:30.458
Halt!

26:40.375 --> 26:44.083
[in English] Welcome, Commander Elrond.

26:55.083 --> 26:56.458
The Ring you carry.

26:58.958 --> 26:59.958
Show it to me.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.083
A foolish act if I had brought it here.

27:05.250 --> 27:06.333
You are a courtier.

27:07.291 --> 27:09.750
More suited to wielding a scroll
than a sword.

27:09.750 --> 27:11.375
You've never seen me wield either.

27:11.375 --> 27:13.458
You should've just kept charging, Elrond.

27:13.458 --> 27:17.000
If she speaks again, cut out her tongue.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.875
[Orcs growl]

27:21.791 --> 27:25.541
Sauron is my enemy as much as yours.

27:26.583 --> 27:30.083
Give me what I need to defeat him
and let us all be rid of him.

27:30.083 --> 27:33.291
Is it not you that has done his bidding
by laying siege to Eregion?

27:33.291 --> 27:35.875
Eregion has fallen into shadow.

27:36.958 --> 27:42.083
It belongs to the Deceiver now,
as does every Elf within its walls.

27:42.083 --> 27:43.708
Not Lord Celebrimbor.

27:43.708 --> 27:47.958
It was Celebrimbor himself
who welcomed Sauron in.

27:49.208 --> 27:50.708
You cannot save him.

27:52.250 --> 27:54.041
You can save Galadriel.

27:57.791 --> 27:59.375
It is an earnest offer.

28:00.916 --> 28:02.416
I suggest you take it.

28:03.541 --> 28:05.625
And leave Sauron to me.

28:12.541 --> 28:16.041
You have the beauty of your foremother,
Melian of the Valar.

28:17.541 --> 28:21.166
If even a fragment of her wisdom
is in your veins,

28:22.333 --> 28:25.125
you must know you cannot
defeat me in battle.

28:26.666 --> 28:28.500
I will outmaneuver you,

28:29.041 --> 28:34.250
my forces outfight yours,
and you will fall.

28:35.625 --> 28:38.791
Not before you have painted
the sands of the Glanduin black

28:39.625 --> 28:41.166
with the blood of your kin.

28:41.166 --> 28:42.583
[growls]

28:42.583 --> 28:44.750
My children have endured cruelties

28:44.750 --> 28:48.208
your bravest couldn't bear
to hear spoken aloud.

28:49.375 --> 28:53.666
Are you prepared
to spend their lives so freely, Adar?

28:57.000 --> 28:58.166
Are they?

29:05.000 --> 29:09.958
The Ring for Galadriel's life.
What is it to be?

29:23.958 --> 29:25.791
Ask me on the field,

29:26.791 --> 29:29.208
when the neck
with a blade against it is yours.

29:29.208 --> 29:31.541
[Orcs seethe, snarl]

29:34.375 --> 29:35.375
Very well.

29:39.750 --> 29:41.166
I will meet you there...

29:44.375 --> 29:46.458
with her head on a pike.

29:50.416 --> 29:53.625
If that is to be the way of things,
I should like to bid her farewell.

29:57.875 --> 29:59.083
He's unarmed.

30:17.625 --> 30:18.875
[whispers in Sindarin] Forgive me.

30:23.791 --> 30:24.958
Win.

30:59.375 --> 31:00.541
Vorohil.

31:01.541 --> 31:03.416
[Orcs snarling]

31:06.583 --> 31:10.250
[in English] The enemy outnumber us
ten to one. So why the confidence?

31:11.208 --> 31:13.833
[in Sindarin] Because I know something
the Father of the Orcs does not.

31:13.833 --> 31:14.958
[in English] And what is that?

31:14.958 --> 31:18.458
[in Sindarin] Even now Prince Durin is
rallying a legion of Dwarves to our aid.

31:19.208 --> 31:21.250
And at the first rays of sunlight...

31:22.083 --> 31:25.750
...you will guide them
straight into Adar's flank.

31:27.166 --> 31:28.083
Outstanding.

31:32.916 --> 31:33.916
[in English] Ride to them now.

31:36.208 --> 31:38.333
Meantime, I will ensure
that Eregion's walls

31:38.333 --> 31:39.750
hold for one more night.

31:56.125 --> 31:58.916
Warriors of Khazad-dûm.

32:04.708 --> 32:06.375
At this moment,

32:07.583 --> 32:11.750
the great tale of our Age
is being written.

32:15.208 --> 32:20.583
<i>And it falls to us
to decide whether it will end</i>

32:20.583 --> 32:26.458
<i>in tragedy... or triumph.</i>

32:31.166 --> 32:33.625
Sauron the Stoneheart,

32:35.916 --> 32:41.916
<i>who stole the seven smithing secrets
from our forebearers, has returned.</i>

32:43.000 --> 32:48.916
<i>Forging Rings to enslave us
and all of Middle-earth.</i>

32:49.875 --> 32:52.333
The Elves cannot defeat him.

32:54.541 --> 32:55.958
Not without us.

33:04.000 --> 33:06.000
<i>And Sauron knows this.</i>

33:07.625 --> 33:12.916
He thinks, by stoking our greed,

33:14.750 --> 33:17.916
<i>he can turn our hearts to ash</i>

33:19.166 --> 33:23.166
<i>and sweep us from the field
without a fight.</i>

33:28.916 --> 33:32.375
But we are stronger than he knows.

33:32.375 --> 33:33.916
[all] Aye!

33:33.916 --> 33:38.375
For there is something all Dwarves prize,

33:38.375 --> 33:41.250
far more than riches.

33:41.250 --> 33:45.083
More even than this mountain we hold dear.

33:46.750 --> 33:51.708
Fight with me, so all the world can see,

33:52.250 --> 33:54.416
that Dwarven loyalty

33:54.416 --> 33:59.958
is a force stronger than any sorcery!

33:59.958 --> 34:01.041
[all] Aye!

34:01.041 --> 34:03.541
More powerful than any army!

34:03.541 --> 34:04.875
[all] Aye!

34:04.875 --> 34:09.000
Deeper than the bones of the earth!

34:09.000 --> 34:10.541
[all] Aye!

34:11.416 --> 34:14.375
Will you fight with our friends?

34:14.375 --> 34:15.625
[all] Aye!

34:15.625 --> 34:19.583
Will you fight for Khazad-dûm?

34:19.583 --> 34:22.958
[all] <i>Baruk Khazâd! Baruk Khazâd!</i>

34:22.958 --> 34:34.416
<i>Baruk Khazâd! Baruk Khazâd!</i>

34:34.416 --> 34:36.458
[all cheering]

34:36.458 --> 34:38.166
Khazad...

34:38.166 --> 34:40.291
[all] Dûm!

34:40.291 --> 34:43.416
We march for Eregion!

34:43.416 --> 34:46.625
[all cheering]

34:52.583 --> 34:53.833
[in Sindarin] Defend the city!

34:55.625 --> 34:57.750
- [horse neighing]
- [groans]

35:02.208 --> 35:04.166
[all shouting]

35:09.458 --> 35:10.375
To the wall!

35:11.041 --> 35:11.958
To the wall!

35:14.625 --> 35:16.833
- [grunting]
- [groans]

35:31.041 --> 35:32.791
[growls]

35:37.750 --> 35:38.875
[grunting]

35:40.750 --> 35:42.541
[laughs]

35:48.166 --> 35:50.375
[Zhor, in English]
Gonna spill your guts, Elf.

35:54.125 --> 35:55.791
[gasps, coughing]

35:56.333 --> 35:57.333
[in Sindarin] Die.

35:58.708 --> 36:00.666
[coughing, exclaims]

36:01.500 --> 36:05.125
[in English] No! No! No, no! No!

36:06.125 --> 36:07.166
[screaming]

36:23.750 --> 36:26.666
[arrows whooshing]

36:26.666 --> 36:29.041
[grunting]

36:39.625 --> 36:41.000
[hammering]

36:41.000 --> 36:42.083
[grunts]

36:42.291 --> 36:43.708
That's enough!

36:44.125 --> 36:45.791
[grunting]

36:52.375 --> 36:53.583
[Orc laughs]

36:55.791 --> 36:58.791
[Orc captain] Again! Reset the Ravager!

37:00.291 --> 37:01.375
Move!

37:05.041 --> 37:06.250
[Glüg] Lord-father.

37:07.291 --> 37:09.708
The wall is stronger than we thought.

37:09.708 --> 37:11.791
We may not breach it before morning.

37:12.541 --> 37:15.458
The Elf is faring better
than you expected.

37:15.458 --> 37:19.208
His troops have already destroyed five
of our trebuchets.

37:19.208 --> 37:21.000
Many <i>Uruk</i> are dying.

37:21.958 --> 37:23.833
What are your orders, Lord-father?

37:23.833 --> 37:26.166
- Shall we sound the retreat?
- No.

37:28.541 --> 37:30.125
Sauron must not escape.

37:31.750 --> 37:35.750
Bring down that wall. At any cost.

37:35.750 --> 37:36.791
Adar!

37:41.166 --> 37:45.541
[in Black Speech]
You told us... you loved us.

37:46.625 --> 37:48.666
[in English]
With all that is left of my heart.

37:51.000 --> 37:55.166
Too much,
to let you become Sauron's slaves.

38:10.708 --> 38:11.666
[in Black Speech] Hurry!

38:17.375 --> 38:20.500
[in English] She's still in the camp.
Find her!

38:33.625 --> 38:34.875
[grunts]

38:46.083 --> 38:49.333
[snarling]

38:49.333 --> 38:50.875
[grunts]

38:54.333 --> 38:55.375
[Orc] He's dead.

38:56.291 --> 38:57.291
He's gone.

38:58.375 --> 39:01.791
Eh. You there! Come here and help.

39:06.916 --> 39:07.916
He's dead.

39:18.500 --> 39:20.291
[Orcs grunting]

39:47.625 --> 39:48.916
[growling]

39:59.083 --> 40:01.375
[in Black Speech]
In flames they return to darkness.

40:04.333 --> 40:06.541
In flames they return to darkness.

40:20.833 --> 40:23.541
[growling]

40:33.750 --> 40:36.916
[in English] Look at that pretty hair.

40:38.000 --> 40:40.416
- [arrows whoosh]
- [groans]

41:00.541 --> 41:01.541
[Galadriel sighs]

41:02.416 --> 41:04.875
Whatever force it was
that brought you here, soldier,

41:05.750 --> 41:07.208
I am grateful for it.

41:07.625 --> 41:12.041
Come, I know a hidden way into the city.
We must find Sauron.

41:12.041 --> 41:13.541
I'm here for him.

41:18.500 --> 41:22.750
Try to move against him now,
the cost will be your life.

41:25.125 --> 41:26.375
He can have it.

41:28.958 --> 41:31.250
He has taken everything else from me.

41:34.166 --> 41:35.375
Arondir.

41:38.041 --> 41:41.250
There is a dearth of Elven heroes
this night.

41:43.166 --> 41:46.875
It would be a pity to lose another.

41:48.875 --> 41:51.666
And the true fight with Adar
will come later.

42:04.625 --> 42:05.791
[Prince Durin IV sighs]

42:07.583 --> 42:09.916
The army has assembled at the West-gate,
Prince Durin.

42:09.916 --> 42:11.208
Good.

42:11.208 --> 42:13.250
[Narvi shouts] Durin!

42:15.541 --> 42:16.541
Prince Durin!

42:18.875 --> 42:19.916
Wait!

42:24.750 --> 42:28.625
Your father, he turned his axe on my men.

42:30.833 --> 42:33.666
He cut through them like stalks of wheat.

42:33.666 --> 42:35.333
[chuckling]

42:35.708 --> 42:37.541
But he's gonna dig.

42:38.250 --> 42:40.250
He's gonna loose that beast!

42:40.250 --> 42:42.625
- Disa, is she--
- I don't know.

42:42.625 --> 42:44.833
But she sent me to find you.

42:44.833 --> 42:47.625
She says you have to recall the army.

42:48.125 --> 42:49.583
And what about Elrond?

42:50.708 --> 42:53.000
You take that army to Eregion now,

42:53.791 --> 42:56.291
and Khazad-dûm
might not be here when you return.

43:12.416 --> 43:16.500
Be not afraid. This too shall pass.

43:19.291 --> 43:23.250
I promise you,
when Middle-earth is healed,

43:23.250 --> 43:25.875
and its people see
what you and I did here...

43:29.250 --> 43:31.291
all our sufferings will be worth it.

43:32.833 --> 43:33.833
"Our sufferings"?

43:34.500 --> 43:38.375
You must know it pains me,
treating you like--

43:38.375 --> 43:40.541
Like you've treated countless others?

43:45.125 --> 43:46.541
Like Morgoth treated me.

43:49.458 --> 43:52.458
Do you know what it is to be tortured
at the hands of a god?

43:54.833 --> 43:56.250
I cannot imagine.

43:57.916 --> 44:01.083
I see the end, Celebrimbor.

44:02.666 --> 44:03.791
So clearly.

44:05.041 --> 44:07.208
I have seen it from the moment I awoke.

44:08.666 --> 44:12.666
But his end, it was different from mine.

44:15.250 --> 44:21.208
For what he wished to destroy,
I wished... to perfect.

44:24.458 --> 44:28.833
Sometimes, the pain
almost became a reward.

44:29.625 --> 44:31.083
Became a game.

44:32.583 --> 44:36.416
A contest,
to see whose will was the mightier.

44:38.541 --> 44:42.958
And after all that, you would still choose
to inflict the same pain upon me?

44:42.958 --> 44:44.041
No.

44:51.250 --> 44:52.833
You chose it.

44:55.083 --> 44:56.208
Not I.

44:58.500 --> 44:59.333
What?

45:03.041 --> 45:07.583
All depends... on the Rings.

45:08.958 --> 45:11.875
And since you forced me

45:11.875 --> 45:15.708
to torment you to bring them into being,

45:17.916 --> 45:20.208
I am but a victim of your obstinance.

45:22.500 --> 45:27.000
And you, the true author
of your own torment.

45:33.208 --> 45:34.208
[scoffs]

45:35.083 --> 45:37.083
You truly are the Great Deceiver.

45:42.166 --> 45:44.083
You can deceive even yourself.

45:48.541 --> 45:49.958
Finish them.

46:13.375 --> 46:17.500
[disembodied voices whispering]

46:26.041 --> 46:29.166
[disembodied voices whispering]

46:35.416 --> 46:36.666
[groans]

46:40.375 --> 46:41.666
Release!

46:43.500 --> 46:44.875
[groans]

46:49.333 --> 46:50.750
[groans]

46:51.541 --> 46:54.250
[grunting]

47:04.791 --> 47:05.791
[Elrond] Hurry!

47:21.041 --> 47:22.041
[gasps]

47:32.708 --> 47:33.791
[soldier] Fire!

47:43.208 --> 47:44.333
[grunts]

47:47.916 --> 47:48.958

47:50.833 --> 47:52.708

[panting]

48:34.125 --> 48:37.125
[shuddering]

48:53.166 --> 48:57.000
Whose will is the mightier?

48:59.916 --> 49:01.208
[flesh squelches]

49:02.666 --> 49:04.875
[shuddering]

49:10.416 --> 49:12.958

49:13.708 --> 49:15.833
[shuddering]

49:45.541 --> 49:46.833
[indistinct shouting]

49:47.708 --> 49:48.708
[heart beating faintly]

49:51.208 --> 49:53.083
[soldier 1]
Look what he's done to himself.

49:53.083 --> 49:55.250
[soldier 2] The old fool
really has gone mad.

49:55.916 --> 49:59.833
You are to remain in the tower,
so as not to be a danger to yourself.

50:00.541 --> 50:04.250
By order of Annatar. Lord of Eregion.

50:08.250 --> 50:10.000
[groaning]

50:12.833 --> 50:13.958
[Galadriel] Release him.

50:15.166 --> 50:16.041
[Commander Malendol] My lady?

50:17.500 --> 50:22.750
That is Lord Celebrimbor.
Greatest of Elven-smiths.

50:24.250 --> 50:26.250
- Release him.
- But the Lord of Eregion ordered--

50:26.250 --> 50:28.625
This is the Lord of Eregion.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.250
Celebrimbor, it's me.

50:49.333 --> 50:50.541
Celebrimbor.

50:51.416 --> 50:53.000
When I saw you,

50:54.166 --> 50:57.125
for a moment, I was certain
that you were but another illusion,

50:58.750 --> 51:02.750
another cruelty devised to torment me
with false hope.

51:02.750 --> 51:03.958
Sauron?

51:06.208 --> 51:07.541
More Rings?

51:07.541 --> 51:08.875
Nine.

51:11.000 --> 51:15.416
Nine Rings to enslave the world of Men.

51:16.000 --> 51:19.750
As he... enslaved me.

51:21.416 --> 51:23.875
I-- It was my fault.

51:23.875 --> 51:24.958
No!

51:25.875 --> 51:29.750
From the beginning, a part of me... knew.

51:30.375 --> 51:34.041
A part of me saw. But I--
I wanted what he offered.

51:35.125 --> 51:40.291
So, I, I blinded myself to,
to what he was.

51:42.625 --> 51:43.958
So did I.

51:46.166 --> 51:47.708
[Sauron screams]

51:48.375 --> 51:50.375
- It is him.
- Hurry.

51:50.375 --> 51:54.583
The old Dwarven tunnel.
I used it to enter the city undetected.

51:54.583 --> 51:57.000
It will bear you and the Rings
far from here.

51:57.000 --> 51:58.083
No. No.

51:58.083 --> 51:59.458
Go! Now!

51:59.458 --> 52:01.625
I cannot. It must be you.

52:01.625 --> 52:04.541
He will realize what has happened.
He will come for the Rings.

52:04.541 --> 52:09.583
I will ensure it is some time
before that comes to pass.

52:10.750 --> 52:15.666
Take the Rings,
save anyone in the city you can. Hurry!

52:15.666 --> 52:16.833
No.

52:18.083 --> 52:20.333
I won't let you face him alone!

52:20.333 --> 52:23.166
I... I built this city.

52:25.083 --> 52:26.833
My place is here.

52:28.041 --> 52:29.875
[Commander Malendol]
And he will not be alone.

52:39.166 --> 52:42.250
I'm sorry. I brought him here.

52:44.500 --> 52:46.708
I'm sorry I wasn't stronger.

52:47.208 --> 52:49.208
Neither of us was strong enough.

52:50.541 --> 52:53.291
There might not be anyone
in Middle-earth who is.

52:55.000 --> 52:59.500
But perhaps, the Elves need only remember

53:00.916 --> 53:04.750
that it is not strength
that overcomes darkness,

53:06.541 --> 53:07.791
but light.

53:08.750 --> 53:10.500
<i>Armies may rise,</i>

53:13.000 --> 53:14.958
<i>hearts may fail,</i>

53:14.958 --> 53:20.958
<i>yet still, light endures,
and is mightier than strength.</i>

53:20.958 --> 53:22.458
[growls]

53:25.208 --> 53:30.708
For in its presence,
all darkness must flee.

53:30.708 --> 53:32.625
[sniffling]

53:36.625 --> 53:38.041
[in Quenya] <i>Namarië.</i>

Again! We're almost there! [grunts]

54:26.250 --> 54:27.291
[growls]

54:32.625 --> 54:35.208
They'll breach the wall soon, Commander.
Won't they?

54:35.208 --> 54:38.625
No, Rían! Our enemy will not
breach that wall!

54:38.625 --> 54:41.375
A single arrow from you
may yet turn the tide.

54:42.583 --> 54:45.500
- How many torch arrows do you have left?
- Enough to do my part.

54:45.500 --> 54:47.083
All I need is a clear line of sight.

54:47.083 --> 54:48.375
Follow me.

54:50.166 --> 54:51.000
[in Sindarin] Go!

54:51.833 --> 54:53.791

Take the shot!

56:14.250 --> 56:15.250
[in English] Destroy it!

56:26.916 --> 56:28.208
Send him in.

56:29.291 --> 56:33.833
Lord-father, he will kill our own kind.

56:34.625 --> 56:36.166
Send him in.

57:17.166 --> 57:18.250
[shatters]

57:35.375 --> 57:37.208
You shall not find them here.

57:38.416 --> 57:40.833
They will be far from your reach by now.

57:46.166 --> 57:50.625
Then you are going to bring them to me
and place them in my hand.

57:50.625 --> 57:53.208
Your hand will never touch
another Ring again.

57:57.541 --> 57:58.958
[speaks Sindarin]

58:09.583 --> 58:11.833
[in English] By order

You think it was only you,

You will give me the Nine.
