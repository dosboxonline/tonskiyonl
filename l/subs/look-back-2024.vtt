LETTER FROM AN ALIEN BY FUJINO
FIRST KISS BY FUJINO

04:42.208 --> 04:43.082
All right.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.708
I'm handing out this week's newspaper.

04:46.291 --> 04:48.541
Don't forget to show it to your parents.

04:57.625 --> 04:59.291
The drawings are so good.

04:59.750 --> 05:03.083
Fujino, this week's four-panel
manga strips were really funny!

05:05.083 --> 05:06.540
Oh, these.

05:06.541 --> 05:09.625
I was kind of busy this week,
so I drew it in five minutes.

05:10.291 --> 05:13.916
But I guess they turned out
pretty good despite that.

05:14.500 --> 05:18.000
You could be a manga artist
when you grow up.

05:19.916 --> 05:23.375
A manga artist? Maybe.

05:23.916 --> 05:27.040
But sitting at a desk
drawing all day sounds boring.

05:27.041 --> 05:30.749
You're good at sports too,
so why not be an athlete?

05:30.750 --> 05:33.124
Yeah, that sounds better.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.457
Either way, give me your autograph.

05:35.458 --> 05:37.249
Okay, fine.

05:37.250 --> 05:38.666
I want one too!

05:39.250 --> 05:40.125
Fujino.

05:40.625 --> 05:43.582
Yeah. What is it, teacher?

05:44.708 --> 05:47.500
About the four-panel manga for next week,

05:48.083 --> 05:50.333
can I give one slot to Kyomoto?

05:50.916 --> 05:53.540
Kyomoto? Who's that?

05:53.541 --> 05:56.249
A truant student from the class next door.

05:56.250 --> 05:59.500
She can't come to school,
but wants to try drawing manga.

06:02.250 --> 06:04.415
I mean, I guess I don't mind.

06:04.416 --> 06:08.415
But drawing decent art
would be difficult for an amateur.

06:08.416 --> 06:13.375
I'm not sure a wimp who can't even
come to school can handle it.

06:14.416 --> 06:16.874
I'm handing out the newspaper.

07:04.416 --> 07:06.624
Who's Kyomoto?

07:06.625 --> 07:08.416
She's the truant kid, right?

07:11.333 --> 07:12.832
But, you know,

07:12.833 --> 07:17.375
compared to Kyomoto's drawings,
yours look pretty average.

07:31.875 --> 07:35.291
Fujino, how come
you're so good at drawing?

07:36.916 --> 07:40.041
You have the best drawing skills
out of all my students.

07:41.916 --> 07:44.750
You could become an artist
with these skills.

07:47.541 --> 07:51.208
Compared to Kyomoto's drawings,
yours look pretty average.

08:03.958 --> 08:05.291
I see.

08:06.333 --> 08:12.041
Kyomoto must be practicing drawing
while I go to school.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.040
A fourth grader who's better
at drawing than me?

08:23.041 --> 08:25.208
Absolutely unacceptable!

10:14.625 --> 10:16.208
Yeah! Are you sure?

10:18.416 --> 10:19.666
Fujino.

10:20.250 --> 10:21.541
What are you drawing?

10:25.125 --> 10:26.125
Hey.

10:26.708 --> 10:28.125
A human skeleton.

10:29.541 --> 10:32.125
Hey, we're sixth graders now, you know?

10:34.000 --> 10:37.708
We'll be in middle school next year.
Are you still gonna draw then?

10:38.375 --> 10:39.333
What?

10:40.000 --> 10:41.000
Yeah.

10:41.583 --> 10:43.333
I see.

10:44.791 --> 10:46.040
You know what?

10:46.041 --> 10:48.750
Yosshi and Mihorin haven't
been able to tell you this either,

10:50.000 --> 10:53.166
but aren't you getting
too old to keep drawing?

10:59.000 --> 11:02.915
You don't hang out with us anymore.

11:02.916 --> 11:05.790
Even when you do,
you're always drawing and you don't talk.

11:05.791 --> 11:06.875
Not to mention,

11:07.500 --> 11:09.790
if you keep drawing in middle school,

11:09.791 --> 11:12.791
people will think you're
a creepy <i>otaku</i>, you know?

11:15.000 --> 11:16.415
Kae, can we go now?

11:16.416 --> 11:17.333
Coming!

11:18.125 --> 11:19.250
Wait for me!

11:19.875 --> 11:23.166
Stop bothering her. She's drawing, right?

11:29.958 --> 11:32.332
Mom says hurry up
and take your bath already.

11:32.333 --> 11:35.540
Didn't I tell you to knock
before entering my room?

11:35.541 --> 11:36.457
Geez!

11:36.458 --> 11:37.832

11:50.250 --> 11:52.457

11:52.458 --> 11:54.124
You can put it in your school report.

11:54.125 --> 11:55.625
Whatever.

11:56.166 --> 12:00.583
Mom and Dad don't say it,
but they're worried about you.

12:01.166 --> 12:05.250
You're always cooped up in your room
and your test scores are terrible.

12:07.083 --> 12:08.500
Get out.

12:28.125 --> 12:29.999
All right, quiet down.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.541

Hey, Fujino.
Congratulations on your graduation.

14:10.708 --> 14:12.582
I'm sorry, but I need a favor.

14:12.583 --> 14:15.540
Could you give this graduation diploma
to Kyomoto for me?

14:15.541 --> 14:17.165
I'll give you her address.

14:17.166 --> 14:20.708
What? Why me?

14:21.958 --> 14:26.540
Well, even if you quit drawing
in sixth grade,

14:26.541 --> 14:29.332
you guys still worked together
on the newspaper manga.

14:29.333 --> 14:32.582
I'm sure Kyomoto would rather get it
from you than from an old man like me.

14:32.583 --> 14:35.374
Well, I'd rather not, really.

14:35.375 --> 14:36.916
Oh, come on.

14:37.416 --> 14:39.541

Someone's home.

17:13.416 --> 17:16.083
I'm leaving your graduation diploma here!

17:16.916 --> 17:18.250
Goodbye!

17:33.125 --> 17:34.125
Fujino-sensei!

17:58.041 --> 17:59.166
Kyomoto?

18:13.291 --> 18:17.749
Every week, I got... I got the newspaper.

18:17.750 --> 18:22.208
I read your manga from the start,
since third grade.

18:23.791 --> 18:25.207
I... I...

18:25.208 --> 18:29.625
I'm a fan of yours, Fujino-sensei!

18:30.208 --> 18:31.625
Can I have your autograph?

18:34.833 --> 18:36.750
I don't have any paper!

18:38.000 --> 18:38.915
My back!

18:38.916 --> 18:41.291
Please sign the back of my jacket!

18:46.958 --> 18:47.916
Sure.

18:52.833 --> 18:57.415
My favorites are <i>Love Square</i> from the
second week of August in third grade,

18:57.416 --> 19:02.332
the <i>Sasaki</i> series you did
from January to March in fourth grade,

19:02.333 --> 19:07.124
and every single one
from fifth and sixth grades was brilliant.

19:07.125 --> 19:10.040
I couldn't always finish
my strips in time,

19:10.041 --> 19:12.957
but you did one every week
while attending school.

19:12.958 --> 19:15.833
I couldn't believe
you were a grade schooler like me.

19:16.291 --> 19:20.624
Your stories and drawings
kept getting better around fifth grade,

19:20.625 --> 19:22.375
I was sure of it.

19:23.666 --> 19:26.250
Fujino-sensei, you're a manga genius!

19:31.583 --> 19:33.500
So, why...

19:35.000 --> 19:39.583
Why did you stop drawing your strips
in the middle of sixth grade?

19:41.708 --> 19:43.083
Well, actually...

19:44.083 --> 19:47.082
I'm trying to come up with a story
for a manga competition.

19:47.083 --> 19:50.000
So basically,
I quit so that I could reach the next level.

19:51.750 --> 19:52.958
A manga competition?

19:55.500 --> 19:56.415
Amazing!

19:56.416 --> 19:59.708
I wanna see it! I totally wanna see it!
That's so amazing!

20:00.833 --> 20:02.458
I wanna see! I wanna see!

20:03.041 --> 20:06.083
Well, the idea's only in my head for now,

20:06.750 --> 20:08.874
but it's pretty much finished.

20:08.875 --> 20:11.916
Basically, all that's left
is to draw a draft and ink it.

20:13.875 --> 20:15.875
I wanna see! I wanna see!

20:18.750 --> 20:21.833
Then, I guess I could show you
when it's done.

20:30.291 --> 20:32.958
It's starting to rain. I should go.

20:34.375 --> 20:35.500

Wait, you finished the background already?

22:40.708 --> 22:43.500
Yes. I don't go to school,
so it's a piece of cake.

be able to finish all 45 pages.

23:31.041 --> 23:34.375
But it took us an entire year
to finish it.

23:35.041 --> 23:37.333
And she's done all the backgrounds.

23:37.916 --> 23:42.291
No, no. Being able to finish a manga
as a middle school student is a feat.

23:45.625 --> 23:48.040
The drawings and story
are both high quality.

24:44.333 --> 24:45.500
Me too.

24:46.083 --> 24:48.083
And, guess what?

24:48.625 --> 24:49.458
Ta-da!

24:50.041 --> 24:51.666
I withdrew 100,000 yen.

25:01.708 --> 25:03.875
You could buy a house with that.

25:04.333 --> 25:05.916
Want to buy one?

25:07.458 --> 25:09.041
Let's go into town tomorrow.

25:09.625 --> 25:11.083
It's my treat.

25:11.666 --> 25:15.333
Don't you need to save that?

25:16.458 --> 25:19.999
Well, we're gonna draw more manga
and make loads of money anyway.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.458
So let's go eat tons of whipped cream
with this money.

25:27.000 --> 25:27.958
Yeah.

25:37.791 --> 25:39.708

26:18.791 --> 26:21.166
Thank you for the treating me today.

26:21.833 --> 26:25.291
We spent like crazy,
but we only used 5,000 yen.

26:27.541 --> 26:30.332
I'm glad I came out of my room.

26:30.333 --> 26:31.250
What?

26:31.833 --> 26:36.291
To tell you the truth,
I was afraid to go out today.

26:37.250 --> 26:42.541
You see, I stopped going to school
because I was scared of people.

26:44.541 --> 26:49.041
But I had a really good time today.

26:50.458 --> 26:55.540
I started drawing because
I had nothing to do at home.

26:55.541 --> 26:58.666
But now I'm glad I did.

27:00.041 --> 27:03.833
Fujino, thank you
for getting me out of my room.

27:05.375 --> 27:07.415
You can thank me with 100,000 yen.

27:07.416 --> 27:08.333
What?

27:09.000 --> 27:09.958
Just kidding.

We're getting serialized?

28:34.291 --> 28:37.582
The editor-in-chief wants you to try it
after you graduate high school.

28:37.583 --> 28:40.250
You've already had seven one-shots
published at age 17!

28:40.833 --> 28:42.791
Honestly, it's happening a little late.

28:56.875 --> 28:59.250
I'm sorry, I...

29:00.875 --> 29:03.375
I want to go to art school.

29:04.166 --> 29:05.083
So...

29:06.166 --> 29:07.125
So,

29:07.750 --> 29:10.000
I can't help with the series.

29:13.916 --> 29:16.000
Where's this coming from all of a sudden?

29:17.250 --> 29:19.915
Well, I guess it's fine.

29:19.916 --> 29:22.415
You only draw the backgrounds anyway.

29:22.416 --> 29:25.458
I can just get assistants to handle that.

29:28.500 --> 29:31.999
But there's no point
in going to art school.

29:32.000 --> 29:34.958
I heard there are no job prospects
even with an art degree.

29:35.875 --> 29:36.708
Yeah.

29:37.250 --> 29:38.749
I know...

29:38.750 --> 29:41.791
And you'll have to talk
to lots of strangers, you know?

29:42.708 --> 29:45.583
I'll work on that.

29:47.916 --> 29:51.583
If you just stick with me,
everything will work out.

29:58.125 --> 30:01.750
I want to try living on my own,

30:02.416 --> 30:04.791
without having to rely on you.

30:07.500 --> 30:09.583
It'll be so boring! I guarantee you!

30:10.166 --> 30:11.083
No, it won't!

30:11.666 --> 30:13.165
It totally will be!

30:13.166 --> 30:16.916
Not to mention, there's no way
you can handle college life on your own!

30:17.833 --> 30:19.749
I can! I will learn how!

30:19.750 --> 30:21.040
You'll fail!

30:21.041 --> 30:24.457
You're too shy to even talk
to the cashier at the convenience store!

30:24.458 --> 30:26.290
I'll practice.

30:26.291 --> 30:27.332
You can't pull it off!

30:27.333 --> 30:29.125
- But...
- What?

30:37.541 --> 30:38.583
I want to...

30:39.500 --> 30:41.291
get better at drawing.

32:11.958 --> 32:15.708
Yes. She works diligently,

but it's just not working out.

32:18.541 --> 32:20.041
Is there anyone else?

32:24.541 --> 32:28.375
Right, yes. I need more assistants.

32:32.416 --> 32:35.208
She's fast, but...

32:38.958 --> 32:41.458
She doesn't give enough thought
to the full picture.

I want the artwork
to be super high quality.

34:30.208 --> 34:32.750
But I draw really slow.

34:33.583 --> 34:36.083
I wish I could draw faster.

34:36.666 --> 34:38.125
That's easy.

34:38.666 --> 34:41.207
If your drawing skills improve,
so will your speed.

34:41.208 --> 34:43.541
I plan on improving mine.

34:44.125 --> 34:47.166
Then, I'll work on my drawing skills too.

34:47.791 --> 34:49.250

THERE ARE NO OTHER STUDENTS
NEAR THE SOFA

41:08.333 --> 41:12.208
AT 11:19 A.M., A MAN ENTERS FROM
THE OUTDOOR STAIRS AND SEES THE STUDENT

41:22.583 --> 41:26.458
HE IS HOLDING A POINTED TOOL
HE FOUND AT THE ART PRACTICE BUILDING

41:28.666 --> 41:29.666
Hey, you.

41:30.291 --> 41:31.291
I mean...

41:32.791 --> 41:34.291
You. I'm talking to you.

41:37.250 --> 41:38.499
At the exhibition,

41:38.500 --> 41:41.416
there was an artwork
that looked like mine, right?

41:44.125 --> 41:45.833
- My...
- Sorry?

41:48.833 --> 41:52.124
The artwork I posted online!

42:13.000 --> 42:15.791

That was my idea!

42:20.333 --> 42:22.416
You stole my art!

42:45.208 --> 42:48.249
I practice karate at the dojo
in the neighboring town.

42:48.250 --> 42:49.707
I was jogging

42:49.708 --> 42:52.332
when I saw this guy
going into campus with a weapon.

42:52.333 --> 42:54.082
I knew he was trouble,

42:54.083 --> 42:58.082
so I ran after him and when I gave him
a karate kick, I fell and broke my leg.

42:58.083 --> 42:59.541
Pretty lame, isn't it?

43:04.708 --> 43:06.708
Thank you very much.

43:07.541 --> 43:10.541
I'd like to thank you properly,

43:11.208 --> 43:14.916
so can I have your phone number?

43:15.500 --> 43:17.041
Yeah, sure thing.

43:20.583 --> 43:21.750
Fujino.

43:22.875 --> 43:24.250
Fujino-sensei.

43:24.916 --> 43:27.791
Are you Fujino-sensei by any chance?

43:28.416 --> 43:29.582
Sensei?

43:29.583 --> 43:31.207
When you were in grade school,

43:31.208 --> 43:34.541
did you draw four-panel manga strips
for the school newspaper?

43:35.125 --> 43:37.999
Yeah, I did, now that you mention it.

43:38.000 --> 43:39.540
It really is you!

43:39.541 --> 43:42.208
I was a fan of your four-panel manga.

43:43.541 --> 43:45.665
What a coincidence, right?

43:45.666 --> 43:46.999
Thanks.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.666
Sorry, but it's time to go.

43:56.458 --> 44:00.208
Why did you quit drawing manga?

44:06.125 --> 44:08.624
I recently started drawing again.

44:08.625 --> 44:11.250
If my manga gets serialized,
be my assistant, okay?
