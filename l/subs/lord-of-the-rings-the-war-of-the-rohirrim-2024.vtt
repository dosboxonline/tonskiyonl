06:36.874 --> 06:39.224
Lord Freca hasn't been
to court in years.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.705
Why would he show up now?

06:41.879 --> 06:44.404
You don't think he means
to challenge father, do you?

06:44.578 --> 06:46.101
[Haleth] I'd like
to see him try.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.408
[Olwyn] Haleth.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.064
[Héra] Brother.

06:53.238 --> 06:55.850
I doubt Freca even remembers
how to swing a sword.

06:56.024 --> 06:58.679
He's sat idle
in the West-march too long,

06:58.853 --> 07:01.769
stuffing his face,
and his pocket.

07:01.943 --> 07:03.597
Fat and prosperous

07:03.771 --> 07:05.816

most dangerous, Lord Haleth.

07:05.990 --> 07:08.428
It fills them
with false courage,

07:08.602 --> 07:11.648
and false courage
breeds discontent.

07:11.822 --> 07:13.345
Which means what?

07:13.520 --> 07:16.784
[Olwyn] It means Lord Freca
has had a long time

07:16.958 --> 07:19.308
to think about all the things
he doesn't have.

07:21.136 --> 07:23.965

Yes. I am.

It's my first council.

all the sigils.

[Fréaláf] Hmm.

07:58.173 --> 08:02.177
[Lief] But I... [hesitates]
I don't recognize that one.

08:27.245 --> 08:29.552
The Shieldmaidens
were women of The Borderlands.

08:31.423 --> 08:34.818
When all the men were slain,
they took up arms and fought.

08:34.992 --> 08:37.952
They defended Rohan
when no one else could.

08:38.126 --> 08:39.780
Those were darker days.

08:41.608 --> 08:44.959
I've long thought it time
to retire that banner.

08:46.613 --> 08:48.528
And I doubt there are
any of them left.

08:49.659 --> 08:50.834
[Lief] They're all gone?

08:52.183 --> 08:53.184
Not all of them.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.426
Lord of the Eorlingas.
Ninth...

09:17.600 --> 09:22.823
Yes, yes. They know their king
when they see him.

09:22.997 --> 09:25.826
You all look like
you're at a funeral!

09:26.000 --> 09:28.002
Fear not, faint hearts.

General Targg of Dunland.

10:04.734 --> 10:08.520
[Helm] Lord Freca!
It has been a while.

10:08.695 --> 10:10.610
You've missed many a council,

10:10.784 --> 10:13.438

very few meals.

10:15.266 --> 10:18.792
[chuckles nervously]
Freca, the King jests.

10:18.966 --> 10:24.841
I see age has not improved
your manners, my liege.

10:25.015 --> 10:27.148
Am I not welcome
in this great hall?

10:27.322 --> 10:30.978
All loyal men
are welcome here.

10:31.152 --> 10:34.242
Ah, but loyal to whom? Hmm?

10:34.416 --> 10:36.636
To Rohan?

10:36.810 --> 10:39.160
- Or to Gondor?
- [indistinct conversation]

10:39.334 --> 10:44.556
A rumor has reached my ears
that a Gondorian princeling...

10:44.731 --> 10:47.168
[chuckling] has made an offer
for your daughter's hand.

10:47.342 --> 10:49.213
[all talking indistinctly]

10:49.387 --> 10:51.172
[gasps]

10:51.346 --> 10:52.260
Do you deny it?

10:52.434 --> 10:54.044
[tense music playing]

10:54.218 --> 10:57.787
It's none of your business
whom my daughter marries!

10:57.961 --> 10:59.223
I say it is.

11:00.877 --> 11:03.880
I say it is
all of our business.

11:04.054 --> 11:06.970
[all talking indistinctly]

11:07.144 --> 11:09.103
I come before this council

11:09.277 --> 11:13.629
with an offer to strengthen,
not weaken Rohan.

11:13.803 --> 11:15.936
For too long
our houses have squabbled

11:16.110 --> 11:18.895
while Gondor usurps
our greatness.

11:19.069 --> 11:21.637
They would respect us,
nay, fear us,

11:21.811 --> 11:25.032
were we truly united.

11:25.206 --> 11:30.472
It is past time for Rohan
to stop being Gondor's lapdog.

11:30.646 --> 11:34.432
Consider instead
a son of the West-march.

11:34.606 --> 11:36.826
[both mutter] Hmm.

11:43.659 --> 11:48.011
I, Wulf, son of Freca,

11:48.185 --> 11:51.362
come before you, Héra,
daughter of Helm...

11:52.146 --> 11:54.148
Wulf, don't.

11:57.804 --> 11:59.849
...to seek your hand
in marriage.

12:00.023 --> 12:01.938
[court gasps,

12:03.592 --> 12:04.636
[Freca] Well, girl?

12:06.334 --> 12:08.205
What do you say, hmm?

12:08.379 --> 12:10.077
- [Héra sighs]
- [Helm] Enough!

12:10.251 --> 12:11.600
[all gasp]

12:13.254 --> 12:16.039
You speak of
uniting our people,

12:16.213 --> 12:20.609
when it is I who has
faced down death, famine, war

12:20.783 --> 12:23.525
to hold these lands together.

12:23.699 --> 12:28.748
I know why you have come,
Freca, son of Dunland.

12:28.922 --> 12:34.188
You do not seek an alliance,
you seek a throne.

12:34.362 --> 12:37.408
Old kings that refuse
a proffered staff

12:37.582 --> 12:39.454
may fall on their knees.

12:39.628 --> 12:44.111
You do not command
the loyalty you think you do.

12:44.285 --> 12:45.634
[somber music playing]

12:45.808 --> 12:48.332
Sire, this is not the place.

12:49.856 --> 12:52.510
My nephew speaks true.

12:52.684 --> 12:55.252
A king does not brawl
in his own house.

12:55.426 --> 12:56.776
[Freca grunts]

12:56.950 --> 13:00.301
But men are freer outside.

13:00.475 --> 13:02.912
Wouldn't you agree?

13:03.086 --> 13:04.958
- [dramatic music playing]
- [Freca grunts softly]

13:05.132 --> 13:08.091
[all whispering]

13:16.404 --> 13:18.362
[somber music playing]

13:23.933 --> 13:25.717
Is this wise, Uncle?

13:26.675 --> 13:28.329
[Helm] I know Freca.

13:28.503 --> 13:30.635
He hasn't a noble bone
in his body.

13:34.944 --> 13:36.467
Mark my word,

13:36.641 --> 13:38.992
he would not be satisfied
with marriage to Héra.

13:39.166 --> 13:41.646
He would see his son
on my throne

13:41.821 --> 13:44.127
and my boys in a grave.

13:48.784 --> 13:52.570
Time to remind him
of his place.

13:52.744 --> 13:56.574
The line of Helm
is not so easily broken.

14:04.017 --> 14:07.324
[Olwyn] Come away, child.
Leave them be.

14:10.153 --> 14:11.154
[sighs]

14:12.721 --> 14:15.767
[soft, melancholic
music playing]

14:15.942 --> 14:17.378
[Wulf] You did not give
an answer.

14:19.206 --> 14:20.772
We should go.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.165
- Would it be so bad?
- [gasps]

14:23.079 --> 14:25.081
We were inseparable once.

14:25.255 --> 14:26.735
We were children.

14:28.780 --> 14:30.260
Is she with him?

14:30.434 --> 14:31.435
[sighs] Aye.

14:35.091 --> 14:36.832
[Wulf] Well, I did not think
so much had changed.

14:38.616 --> 14:39.922
Wulf, please.

14:40.749 --> 14:42.707
I care about you.

14:42.882 --> 14:44.796
[Wulf] But...

14:44.971 --> 14:47.625
you'd rather marry
a stranger from Gondor?

14:47.799 --> 14:50.150
I have no thoughts
of marriage at all.

14:50.324 --> 14:53.501
Our fathers speak as if I were
not even in the room.

14:53.675 --> 14:54.981
This should be
my decision to make.

14:55.155 --> 14:57.679
It should be yours, too.

14:57.853 --> 15:00.551
And what if I told you
this is what I want?

15:01.422 --> 15:03.641
What I've always wanted.

15:03.815 --> 15:05.687
- I love you.
- No.

15:06.818 --> 15:09.865
I do not want to marry you.

15:10.039 --> 15:13.086
I do not want to marry
any man.

15:13.260 --> 15:15.915
You asked for my answer,
you have it.

15:16.089 --> 15:17.046
[Haleth] Héra!

15:17.220 --> 15:19.135
[both gasp]

15:19.309 --> 15:22.486
Come, sister,
or we'll miss all the fun.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.360
[melancholic music
continues playing]

15:26.534 --> 15:27.665

[breathes deeply]

[somber music playing]

15:34.629 --> 15:36.979
- [indistinct conversation]
- [man coughs]

15:39.634 --> 15:41.288
[Helm] Now, Dunlending,

15:41.462 --> 15:44.247
you have only Helm
to deal with.

15:44.421 --> 15:47.598
Just you and me. Unarmed.

15:47.772 --> 15:51.080
You will live to regret this,
old man.

15:52.299 --> 15:53.691
Dress the girl
however you like.

15:53.865 --> 15:55.258
Can't you stop this?

15:55.432 --> 15:57.652
- Your daughter's no lady.
- [Wulf sighs]

15:57.826 --> 16:02.439
No wonder she's wild.
Raised by a brute like you.

16:02.613 --> 16:05.051
"Feral" they call her.

16:05.225 --> 16:07.140
Right at home
in the rough country.

16:08.358 --> 16:10.012
[sighs]

16:10.186 --> 16:15.626
[inhales sharply] But, no,
she's "too good" for my son.

16:17.672 --> 16:20.501
- [grunting]
- [groaning]

16:20.675 --> 16:22.329
[both panting]

16:23.591 --> 16:25.462
Hmm.

16:25.636 --> 16:29.814
Your daughter will come
crawling on her knees,

16:29.989 --> 16:32.208
begging my son to marry her
before the end.

16:32.382 --> 16:34.036
- [grunts]
- [groans]

16:34.210 --> 16:35.951
[exhales]

Father!

16:37.213 --> 16:40.564
[breath trembling]

16:40.738 --> 16:42.697
Get up, Freca!

16:42.871 --> 16:44.742
Get up and fight!

16:44.916 --> 16:46.048
Father?

16:50.444 --> 16:51.445
[gasps]

16:52.576 --> 16:53.925
He's dead.

16:54.100 --> 16:55.536
- [all gasp]
- [all shouting indistinctly]

16:55.710 --> 16:56.754
- No!
- [sighs]

16:57.799 --> 16:59.366
[grumbles]

16:59.540 --> 17:03.283
Impossible! I only struck him
the once.

17:03.457 --> 17:04.719
You saw.

17:04.893 --> 17:05.894
You all saw.

17:06.068 --> 17:08.288
[sighs deeply]

17:09.854 --> 17:11.073
Hmm.

17:11.247 --> 17:13.380
- [sobbing]
- [grave music playing]

17:13.554 --> 17:15.512
[grunts] You killed him.

17:15.686 --> 17:16.687
[crowd exclaims, muttering]

17:16.861 --> 17:18.428
Put the sword down, lad.

17:19.342 --> 17:22.345

17:22.519 --> 17:23.738
- No!

17:31.702 --> 17:33.748
- [Wulf choking]
- [all talking indistinctly]

17:33.922 --> 17:37.708
You dare draw your sword
against the King, Dunlending?

17:37.882 --> 17:40.146
[dramatic music playing]

17:43.149 --> 17:46.021
- [Héra] Father, no! [gasps]
- [grunts softly]

17:46.195 --> 17:48.458
- [groaning]
- You're killing him!

17:50.112 --> 17:52.158

17:55.030 --> 17:58.686
[Wulf gasping]

17:58.860 --> 18:00.557
[Helm] Enough blood
has been spilt.

18:00.731 --> 18:02.472
[panting]

18:03.734 --> 18:05.171
There will be no more.

18:05.345 --> 18:08.087
- [grumbles]
- [all whispering]

18:08.261 --> 18:11.046
You will pay for this
with your life.

18:11.786 --> 18:13.266
I swear it.

18:13.440 --> 18:16.965
Save your breath, boy,
lest it be your last.

18:19.098 --> 18:22.101
Wulf, son of Freca,

18:22.275 --> 18:24.233
you are banished.

18:24.407 --> 18:27.193
If you set foot
on these lands again,

18:28.324 --> 18:31.284
it will be your head.

18:34.025 --> 18:35.940
[dramatic music playing]

18:36.115 --> 18:37.203
[sighs wearily]

Wulf...

[panting]

18:47.996 --> 18:49.867
[somber music playing]

18:57.701 --> 18:58.746

[EÉowyn] <i>Seasons passed.</i>

19:36.349 --> 19:38.481

it was an ill omen</i>

[soft, melancholic
music playing]

20:09.295 --> 20:10.644
[Young Wulf]
Are you ready, Héra?

20:10.818 --> 20:11.775
[Young Héra]
Of course I'm ready.

20:13.516 --> 20:15.170
Come on, Wulf!

- [groaning]

20:42.893 --> 20:44.199
I cut you!

20:44.373 --> 20:46.114
I'm sorry.
I did not mean to hurt you.

20:46.288 --> 20:47.768
- Leave me.
- You're bleeding.

20:47.942 --> 20:49.030
- [gasps]
- [grunts] Go!

20:49.204 --> 20:50.901

[Fréaláf] It's a Southron.

as a mercenary.

I think he was
some kind of Beastmaster.

22:30.044 --> 22:32.046
Aye, but master of what?

22:32.220 --> 22:34.135
What was that old poem

22:34.309 --> 22:36.877
you used to recite to me
as a child?

28:44.723 --> 28:45.636
[man] The Watcher in the Water.

28:45.811 --> 28:46.637
[gasps]

28:48.335 --> 28:50.903
I never thought I'd live
to see such a sight.

28:51.642 --> 28:52.731
General Targg.

28:54.602 --> 28:56.386
What are you doing here?

28:56.560 --> 28:57.605
You were banished.

28:57.779 --> 28:59.433
I was dispatched on a mission,

28:59.607 --> 29:02.131
but it seems that objective
may have changed.

29:02.305 --> 29:04.046
What the...
Dispatched by whom?

29:05.047 --> 29:07.571
I serve a new commander.

29:07.746 --> 29:10.009
The High Lord
of the Hill Tribes.

29:10.183 --> 29:12.185
The Wildmen
have no High Lord.

29:13.186 --> 29:14.317
They do now.

29:14.491 --> 29:15.971
- [grunts]
- [gasps]

29:16.145 --> 29:17.930
- [grunts]

[grunting] How dare you!

29:20.454 --> 29:22.021
- [men grunt]
- [shrieks]

29:22.195 --> 29:24.545
Get your hands off me!
[grunting]

29:24.719 --> 29:26.547
Put me down! [grunts]

29:26.721 --> 29:28.375
[wildling grunts]
She's seen the mumak!

29:28.549 --> 29:30.203
- Why not kill her now?
- [Héra] Let me go!

29:30.377 --> 29:33.206
[Targg] No.
We take her to the High Lord.

29:33.380 --> 29:34.947
[Héra] No! [grunting]

29:35.121 --> 29:36.775
I said, "Let me go!"

29:36.949 --> 29:38.385
[Héra grunting]

30:15.596 --> 30:17.424
[drum beating continues]

30:20.644 --> 30:22.951
- [crickets chirping]
- [men chattering indistinctly]

30:29.523 --> 30:31.046
[Fréaláf] I found her.

30:31.220 --> 30:32.918
They're holding her
in one of the guard towers.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.661
- [breathes deeply]
- [horse neighs]

30:37.836 --> 30:40.099
[Héra] Ashere! [gasps]

30:40.273 --> 30:42.275
How can you eat
at a time like this?

30:42.449 --> 30:45.278
- [men talking indistinctly]
- [breathes deeply]

30:48.107 --> 30:50.761
There must be
another way out of here.

30:50.936 --> 30:53.242
[Olwyn] Who would dare
occupy Isengard?

30:55.941 --> 30:58.552
Someone bold enough
to kidnap a king's daughter.

30:58.726 --> 31:01.555
I'm going after Héra.
Stay hidden.

31:01.729 --> 31:03.122
Keep the horses at the ready.

31:03.296 --> 31:04.819
If I do not return
by the hour...

31:04.993 --> 31:05.951
Wait.

31:07.953 --> 31:09.215
I have a plan.

31:12.653 --> 31:14.394
[somber music playing]

31:14.568 --> 31:15.569
[gasps]

31:41.725 --> 31:43.118
- [Wulf] Always too curious...
- [gasps]

31:43.292 --> 31:44.554
...for your own good.

31:44.728 --> 31:46.730
Wulf!

31:46.905 --> 31:48.863
- You're alive.
- [scroll clutters]

31:50.560 --> 31:51.648
[Héra sighs]

31:53.433 --> 31:56.044
You are the High Lord?

31:56.218 --> 31:57.959
Did you think
I would slink away like a cur

31:58.133 --> 31:59.265
and lick my wounds?

32:01.441 --> 32:03.922
No, I have been busy.

32:06.925 --> 32:11.320
All my life, I was scorned
for my Dunlending blood.

32:11.494 --> 32:15.150
But look who answered
when I needed them.

32:15.324 --> 32:17.892
The Hill Tribes have sworn
an oath to me.

32:19.546 --> 32:21.200
Every last one.

32:21.374 --> 32:23.942
You cannot hope to stand
against Rohan and Gondor.

32:24.768 --> 32:26.248
[laughs slyly]

32:26.422 --> 32:28.598
Your father will never
ask for help from Gondor.

32:29.730 --> 32:31.688
His pride will not allow it.

32:32.776 --> 32:35.866
No. Gondor is not coming.

32:38.260 --> 32:40.697
[tense music playing]

32:42.134 --> 32:44.353
First, I will kill
your brothers.

32:45.615 --> 32:48.575
Then, I will kill your father.

32:48.749 --> 32:51.621
And then,
I will take the throne.

32:51.795 --> 32:53.493
And be king of what?

32:53.667 --> 32:56.757
A land in ruins,
its people torn apart!

32:58.193 --> 33:01.153
You had your chance
to unite Rohan.

33:01.327 --> 33:03.198
- And you refused!
- [grunts]

33:03.372 --> 33:05.200
Did I disgust you so much?

33:05.722 --> 33:07.289
Hmm?

33:07.463 --> 33:09.291
Was I so easily forgotten?

33:11.598 --> 33:13.034
- [grunts]
- [gasps]

33:14.905 --> 33:16.690
I never forgot you.

33:16.864 --> 33:18.692
I tried to find you.

33:18.866 --> 33:20.868
[breathing heavily]

33:33.011 --> 33:35.709
- [Wulf grunts]
- [groans]

33:35.883 --> 33:37.450
[breath trembling]

33:39.582 --> 33:41.584
[somber music playing]

33:44.022 --> 33:46.633
The boy I knew
would never wish for war.

33:47.590 --> 33:49.418
Don't do this, Wulf.

33:49.592 --> 33:51.420
Innocent people will die.

33:56.469 --> 33:59.298
[breathing heavily]

34:04.042 --> 34:06.131
What if there was a way
you could still save them?

34:13.312 --> 34:15.314
A way you could still
save your people.

34:17.925 --> 34:19.405
[Héra] If I agree to this...

34:20.536 --> 34:22.973
If I agree to be your bride,

34:23.148 --> 34:24.758
you swear
there will be no war?

34:25.976 --> 34:29.415
[Wulf] If you agree? [grunts]

34:29.589 --> 34:33.114
Is there no end to
the arrogance of your house?

34:33.288 --> 34:36.161
Even now you can barely
stomach the thought, can you?

34:38.467 --> 34:40.687
The boy you knew
is gone, Héra.

34:45.387 --> 34:48.042
I am the man
your father made me.

34:48.216 --> 34:49.783
- [grunts]
- [shouts]

34:49.957 --> 34:51.045
[gasps]

34:52.394 --> 34:53.395
[Héra] Olwyn!

34:53.569 --> 34:56.311
Don't just sit there. Move!

34:56.485 --> 34:58.879
[grunting]

34:59.053 --> 35:01.273
[dramatic music playing]

35:01.447 --> 35:03.971
[Wulf and Olwyn grunting]

35:09.150 --> 35:11.544
You think you're still
a Shieldmaiden, old woman?

35:11.718 --> 35:13.328
- [grunts]
- Your fighting days are over.

35:14.155 --> 35:15.852
[both grunting]

35:16.810 --> 35:17.724
[Olwyn] Go!

35:17.898 --> 35:20.074
[grunting continues]

35:20.988 --> 35:22.337
[breathing heavily]

35:23.338 --> 35:26.124
[grunting]

35:29.736 --> 35:31.172
[panting]

35:35.002 --> 35:37.309
Come on, greedy.
We're leaving.

35:38.440 --> 35:39.398
[grunts]

35:40.181 --> 35:41.095
Seize them!

35:41.269 --> 35:42.618
[men clamoring]

35:42.792 --> 35:45.143
- [Olwyn] Ride!
- [guard] Summon the guards!

35:45.317 --> 35:47.101
- Stop her!
- [Olwyn] Go!

35:47.275 --> 35:49.059
- [shouting indistinctly]
- [Ashere neighs]

35:49.234 --> 35:50.670
[guard] Cut them off!

35:51.888 --> 35:53.020
Make for the gates!

35:53.194 --> 35:54.195
[guard] Move!

35:54.369 --> 35:56.328
[dramatic music playing]

36:00.245 --> 36:01.376
[guard 1] To the gate!

36:01.550 --> 36:02.464
[guard 2]
They're coming through!

36:02.638 --> 36:03.770
[guard 1] Quickly!

36:03.944 --> 36:05.119
[Ashere trotting]

36:09.515 --> 36:12.082
[Héra] We'll never make it
past the archers!

36:12.257 --> 36:14.824
- Trust me. I have a plan.
- [breathing heavily]

36:14.998 --> 36:16.391
[bow stretching]

36:18.045 --> 36:21.048
- [pants, grunts]
- [screams]

36:21.222 --> 36:22.354
[groans]

36:23.093 --> 36:24.443
[grunts]

36:24.617 --> 36:26.358
[groaning]

36:26.532 --> 36:28.447
[triumphant music playing]

36:28.621 --> 36:30.449
[panting]

36:31.841 --> 36:34.757
- [Héra] This is your plan?
- [grunts]

36:34.931 --> 36:36.890
I didn't say
it was a good one!

36:37.064 --> 36:38.544
[both grunt]

36:38.718 --> 36:39.719
[groans]

36:42.330 --> 36:43.549
- [guard screams]
- [thuds]

36:43.723 --> 36:45.681
[dramatic music playing]

36:45.855 --> 36:47.901
[grunting]

36:48.075 --> 36:49.294
[Lief] My lord!

36:49.468 --> 36:51.644
I'm fine.
Let's get out of here.

36:51.818 --> 36:53.298
[horse neighs]

36:54.864 --> 36:56.605
[men shouting indistinctly]

36:56.779 --> 36:58.390
I'll dispatch
our fastest horsemen.

37:00.305 --> 37:03.308
Don't bother.
She will outride them.

37:05.135 --> 37:06.876
Call the men to arms.

37:15.189 --> 37:16.538
[Héra] Please, listen to me.

37:16.712 --> 37:19.454
We do not know the full
strength of Wulf's army.

37:19.628 --> 37:21.282
Do not underestimate him,
Father.

37:21.456 --> 37:24.329
There is more to Wulf's plan,
I know it.

37:24.503 --> 37:26.113
The mumak,
the Southron we saw.

37:26.287 --> 37:29.247
That is no coincidence.

37:29.421 --> 37:32.293
The beast was diseased,
you said so yourself.

37:32.467 --> 37:34.513
We had reports
of a column of mumakil

37:34.687 --> 37:36.689
moving west,
near our southern border.

37:36.863 --> 37:39.126
One of them must have
broken its chains

37:39.300 --> 37:41.215
and crossed into our lands.

37:41.389 --> 37:44.000
It's got nothing to do
with the Dunlending boy.

37:44.174 --> 37:47.439
The wisest move is to
fall back to our strongholds.

37:47.613 --> 37:50.746
Light the beacons.
Call for aid from Gondor.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.444
"The wisest move"?

37:53.836 --> 37:58.537
You would have me
abandon Edoras?

37:58.711 --> 38:00.756
Until we are
at full strength...

38:01.757 --> 38:02.889
yes.

38:03.063 --> 38:05.500
This is no rabble of Wildmen.

38:05.674 --> 38:08.634
These men are well trained
and well-armed.

38:09.939 --> 38:12.681
[Thorne] My liege, if I may?

38:12.855 --> 38:15.380
Lord Fréaláf is young.

38:17.382 --> 38:21.647
He has not fought beside you
in battle, as I have.

38:21.821 --> 38:23.301
[indistinct whispering]

38:27.087 --> 38:31.352
I pledge 300 riders
to protect the eastern flank.

38:31.526 --> 38:33.136
The men of the Wold

38:33.311 --> 38:35.704
- stand ready to fight.
- [all cheering]

38:35.878 --> 38:38.272
I accept your pledge.

38:38.446 --> 38:41.319
Lord Thorne shall have command
of the east.

38:41.493 --> 38:45.714
I will lead the vanguard north
and meet Wulf on the plains.

38:45.888 --> 38:47.107
[all cheering]

38:47.281 --> 38:49.892
Let every man willing
step forth.

38:50.937 --> 38:53.200
We fight for Rohan!

38:53.374 --> 38:55.071
Please, Uncle, trust me.

38:56.725 --> 39:00.642
Trust you? I trusted you
to protect my daughter.

39:00.816 --> 39:03.950
To keep her safe.
And look what happened.

39:04.124 --> 39:06.648
Kidnapped,
by a filthy upstart.

39:06.822 --> 39:09.869
It was not his fault!
Fréaláf saved me.

39:10.043 --> 39:11.697
She could have died!

39:11.871 --> 39:13.263
[Fréaláf sighs]

39:13.438 --> 39:15.353
[somber music playing]

39:15.527 --> 39:16.832
[Helm sighs]

39:17.833 --> 39:19.008
[winces]

39:21.054 --> 39:24.057
Go back to Dunharrow,
Fréaláf Hildeson.

39:24.231 --> 39:28.453
Dig some trenches
and crawl into them.

39:28.627 --> 39:31.020
When the songs
of this day are sung,

39:31.194 --> 39:34.676
when the names
of its heroes are read,

39:34.850 --> 39:37.940
yours will not be
amongst them.

39:38.114 --> 39:39.551
He's our kin.

39:39.725 --> 39:43.206
He is no kin of mine!

39:43.381 --> 39:48.342
Nor do I need a sword offered
by such a faithless hand.

39:49.996 --> 39:51.954
[somber music
continues playing]

39:53.826 --> 39:54.827
[Fréaláf] My Lord.

39:56.219 --> 39:58.091
Fréaláf, wait!

40:02.574 --> 40:04.358
[Fréaláf] The king has spoken.

40:07.622 --> 40:10.625
You will always have
my sword, Uncle,

40:10.799 --> 40:12.540
whether you value it or not.

40:16.631 --> 40:18.459
[door rattles]

40:18.633 --> 40:21.506
- No.
- [door closes]

40:22.637 --> 40:24.552
[grave music playing]

40:24.726 --> 40:26.685
[indistinct screaming]

40:32.821 --> 40:34.519
[men shouting]

40:42.483 --> 40:46.487
[crying]

40:46.661 --> 40:48.750
[men shouting]

40:53.451 --> 40:55.104
They know
the attack is coming.

40:55.278 --> 40:57.803
From here, we have
a clear path to Edoras.

40:57.977 --> 40:59.369
Helm will expect us
to make camp

40:59.544 --> 41:01.110
on the northern plains.

41:01.284 --> 41:02.285
[Wulf] Good.

41:10.946 --> 41:12.295
[horse whinnies]

41:12.470 --> 41:13.906
War is upon us.

41:15.124 --> 41:18.040
What do you say, old friend?

41:18.214 --> 41:21.261
- Will you carry me once more?
- [horse whinnies]

41:27.833 --> 41:28.877
What are you doing?

41:29.051 --> 41:31.010
I pledge to fight for my king.

41:32.968 --> 41:35.971
Don't be a fool, child.

41:36.145 --> 41:38.713
If you will not listen to me,
then at least let me fight.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.587
You know nothing of war.

41:42.761 --> 41:45.067
I'm the fastest rider
you have.

41:45.241 --> 41:47.243
I can carry messages
between the commanders.

41:48.331 --> 41:50.812
I said "no."

41:50.986 --> 41:54.599
The line of Helm
does not rest on you, Héra.

41:54.773 --> 41:57.776
It resides in Haleth and Háma.

41:57.950 --> 42:00.648
My brothers can defend
their home, but yet I cannot?

42:01.606 --> 42:03.912
One day, you will marry.

42:04.086 --> 42:05.610
You will live in Gondor

42:05.784 --> 42:09.265
and have children
who know nothing of our ways.

42:09.439 --> 42:14.009
To see me gone...
is that what would please you?

42:14.183 --> 42:18.361
Yes, it will please me.
I will rejoice.

42:18.536 --> 42:25.194
You will be alive because
I will have protected you.

42:25.368 --> 42:27.936
Wulf's army is 20 leagues
from Edoras.

42:28.110 --> 42:30.460
They're not setting up camp!
They're not resting!

42:31.244 --> 42:32.767
What?

42:32.941 --> 42:34.769
They're continuing to advance?

42:34.943 --> 42:36.249
The Hill Tribes
are used to attacking

42:36.423 --> 42:37.990
under cover of dark.

42:38.164 --> 42:39.861
He means to strike tonight.

42:44.649 --> 42:46.085
Muster the Rohirrim.

42:46.259 --> 42:48.478
[sweeping music playing]

42:48.653 --> 42:50.785
[all talking indistinctly]

42:55.007 --> 42:56.051
[Héra] Wait!

42:56.225 --> 42:57.531
[panting]

43:04.973 --> 43:07.280
Do not look so grim,
little sister.

43:08.368 --> 43:09.935
[sighs]

43:10.109 --> 43:12.502
Helm Hammerhand
has never lost a battle.

43:14.417 --> 43:15.636
[sighs]

43:20.598 --> 43:23.775
Háma... you need
a faster horse.

43:25.037 --> 43:26.429
Take Ashere.

43:26.604 --> 43:29.868
[chuckles] Ashere will have
no one but you.

43:30.042 --> 43:32.697
Besides, I trust the old girl.

43:35.177 --> 43:36.135
[Héra sighs]

43:41.053 --> 43:42.315
Keep this safe for me.

43:43.142 --> 43:44.143
Always.

43:52.281 --> 43:54.719
Maybe, one day,

43:54.893 --> 43:56.764
someone will sing
ballads of me.

44:00.550 --> 44:01.943
[Haleth grunts softly]

44:09.951 --> 44:11.779
[Haleth] On the morrow,
little sister.

44:13.346 --> 44:15.478
Ride strong, brothers.

44:18.307 --> 44:20.875
[somber music playing]

44:24.183 --> 44:26.141
[horses neighing]

44:35.977 --> 44:38.458
Where is Thorne? He's late.

44:38.632 --> 44:40.982
His men should be
covering the eastern flank.

44:41.156 --> 44:42.810
[Helm] [grimly] hmm.

44:50.905 --> 44:52.951
[Olwyn] I fought beside
your father once.

44:56.868 --> 44:58.173
He saved my entire village

44:58.347 --> 45:00.915
from a pack of
Dunlending raiders.

45:01.089 --> 45:02.830
I broke my shield
in that battle.

45:05.137 --> 45:07.269
Afterwards,
I wanted a new one.

45:07.443 --> 45:09.141
But "No," he told me,

45:09.315 --> 45:12.274
"it's not broken,
it's just broken in."

45:12.448 --> 45:13.928
[chuckles]

45:18.150 --> 45:19.542
[Héra] There's so many of them.

45:21.893 --> 45:25.070
[Olwyn] Your father
is no ordinary man.

45:25.244 --> 45:27.463
[sighs] It'll take more than
an army of Dunlending

45:27.637 --> 45:28.726
to bring him low.

45:31.990 --> 45:34.993
The blood of the ancients
flows in his veins.

45:37.038 --> 45:39.258
The same blood
that flows in yours.

45:41.129 --> 45:43.392
[soft, sweeping music playing]

45:47.309 --> 45:48.484
Oh! [grunts]

45:48.658 --> 45:49.659
[groans]

45:50.443 --> 45:52.097
Oh, the pledges!

45:52.271 --> 45:54.577
Oh, no! No, no, no, no!

45:54.752 --> 45:57.624
The king left these
in my charge for safekeeping.

45:57.798 --> 45:59.104
It's all right,
don't fret, lad.

45:59.278 --> 46:00.758
The king's got other things
on his mind.

46:06.328 --> 46:08.156
- [Héra] Whose mark is this?
- Oh...

46:09.592 --> 46:11.769
That? That's the seal
of Lord Thorne.

46:11.943 --> 46:13.292
- [Héra gasps]
- What is it?

46:14.728 --> 46:16.686
What's wrong?

46:16.861 --> 46:18.993
[Héra] I've seen this before.

46:19.167 --> 46:22.257
Lord Thorne is in league
with Wulf.

46:22.431 --> 46:24.303
He means to betray my father.

46:26.784 --> 46:28.437
We have to get our people out.

46:28.611 --> 46:30.918
Sound the alarm. Now! Go!

46:31.092 --> 46:33.573
[all gasping]

46:33.747 --> 46:35.227
Evacuate the city!

46:36.750 --> 46:38.796
[heroic music playing]

46:39.622 --> 46:41.581
[men shouting]

46:44.105 --> 46:46.194
[horse trotting]

46:56.857 --> 47:02.776
Riders of the Mark,
brothers of Rohan, arise!

47:03.908 --> 47:06.606
Arise now!

47:06.780 --> 47:11.219
We will paint the dawn red
with the blood of our foes!

47:11.393 --> 47:13.439
[all cheering]

47:15.441 --> 47:17.922
Draw your weapons!

47:18.096 --> 47:20.446
- [all shouting]
- [swords clanging]

47:20.620 --> 47:22.448
[horses neighing]

47:25.364 --> 47:27.670
Forth Eorlingas!

47:27.845 --> 47:29.847
- For Rohan!
- [all] Rohan!

47:30.021 --> 47:31.196
[all cheering]

47:36.636 --> 47:38.856
[horn blowing]

47:46.298 --> 47:49.823
- Death!
- [all screaming] Death!

47:49.997 --> 47:51.956
Death!

47:52.130 --> 47:54.132
[heroic music playing]

48:05.056 --> 48:06.535
[commander 1] Archers ready!

48:06.709 --> 48:07.928
[commander 2] Aim!

48:08.102 --> 48:09.712
[commander 1]
Mark your targets!

48:09.887 --> 48:11.410
[soldiers screaming]

48:11.584 --> 48:14.369

48:47.620 --> 48:49.013
Wulf!

48:49.187 --> 48:50.797
Where is he?

48:50.971 --> 48:52.973
Where is their high command?

48:54.932 --> 48:56.063
Find him!

48:57.760 --> 48:59.545
[villagers muttering]

48:59.719 --> 49:01.329
[Olwyn] Keep moving!

49:01.503 --> 49:03.157
You've a long march
ahead of you.

49:03.331 --> 49:04.550
[woman 1] Where are we going?

49:04.724 --> 49:05.594
[woman 2] What about
the children?

49:05.768 --> 49:07.161
Carry only what you need.

49:07.335 --> 49:08.728
Stay together.

49:08.902 --> 49:12.210
Keep the children
to the middle! Go!

49:12.384 --> 49:14.125
- [panting]
- [Ashere whinnies]

49:15.778 --> 49:18.651
Come on, Ashere.
Time to leave.

49:18.825 --> 49:23.047
[Thorne] I fear it is too late
for that... my lady.

49:29.444 --> 49:30.837
Traitor!

49:31.011 --> 49:33.753
My father will see you
hang for this.

49:33.927 --> 49:36.930
You will never know, will you?

49:39.193 --> 49:41.848

50:27.850 --> 50:29.591
Wulf's nowhere to be seen.

50:29.765 --> 50:31.202
Something's not right.

50:31.376 --> 50:35.771
[mûmak growls, trumpets]

50:36.903 --> 50:39.166
Mumakil!

50:39.340 --> 50:41.255
He's using Variag mercenaries.

50:41.429 --> 50:43.301
Edoras is completely exposed.

52:36.849 --> 52:38.503
Listen to me, Haleth.

52:38.677 --> 52:41.288
You must reach the city
before Wulf.

he has betrayed us.

We know. You've already called
the evacuation.

54:27.829 --> 54:29.048

Go, Héra! I'll catch you.

with the last of you!

59:53.851 --> 59:56.027
- You're nearly there!
- [people talking indistinctly]

59:56.201 --> 59:57.594
Hurry now!

59:57.768 --> 01:00:00.858
Inside the keep!
Come on, fast as you can!

01:00:01.032 --> 01:00:03.643
[Héra] A healer!
The king needs a healer.

01:00:03.817 --> 01:00:05.427

01:00:16.656 --> 01:00:17.744
Where is he?

01:00:18.919 --> 01:00:20.007
Where's Háma?

01:00:20.181 --> 01:00:21.661
[grave music playing]

01:00:21.835 --> 01:00:23.402
- [guard 1] This way.
- [Helm] Leave me.

01:00:23.576 --> 01:00:24.621
[guard 2] Sire...

01:00:26.100 --> 01:00:27.232
[Olwyn] Hmm.

01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.756
[Helm groaning]

01:00:29.930 --> 01:00:31.149
[gasps] No.

Háma!

[Helm breathing heavily]

01:00:48.819 --> 01:00:50.777
[softly]
He was right behind us.

01:00:51.473 --> 01:00:52.474
[groans]

01:00:53.388 --> 01:00:54.346
Enough!

01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:57.392
[wind whooshing]

01:01:00.831 --> 01:01:02.659
You have won, Wulf!

01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:04.051
I surrender.

01:01:04.965 --> 01:01:08.795
Let this end now.

01:01:08.969 --> 01:01:11.450
My life for my son's.

01:01:11.624 --> 01:01:12.973
No!

01:01:13.147 --> 01:01:14.583
[grunts]

01:01:16.629 --> 01:01:17.630
[grunts]

01:01:32.036 --> 01:01:33.037
[sighs]

01:01:34.821 --> 01:01:37.389
- Kill me! Take the crown.
- [gasps]

01:01:37.563 --> 01:01:40.479
Leave my people in peace.

01:01:40.653 --> 01:01:44.222
[voice trembling]
Let my boy live!

01:01:44.396 --> 01:01:46.050
[Háma] No! Father, don't!

01:01:46.790 --> 01:01:48.835
Peace?

01:01:49.009 --> 01:01:51.838
There will be no peace
for you, Helm Hammerhand.

01:01:52.012 --> 01:01:55.712
No! Wulf, please, I beg you!

01:02:01.848 --> 01:02:05.199
End this now.
Make the exchange.

01:02:05.373 --> 01:02:07.288
Once they withdraw
behind those walls,

01:02:07.462 --> 01:02:09.073
you will never get them out.

01:02:12.685 --> 01:02:14.905
- Let them.
- [gasps]

01:02:15.079 --> 01:02:16.515
- [Háma groans]
- [blood splatters]

01:02:16.689 --> 01:02:18.952
[all gasp, exclaim]

01:02:19.126 --> 01:02:20.040
Murderer!

01:02:20.214 --> 01:02:21.694
What have you done?

01:02:22.608 --> 01:02:24.218
[women crying]

01:02:28.135 --> 01:02:32.531
You will suffer
as I have suffered.

01:02:32.705 --> 01:02:38.015
You will know what it means
to be alone, as I was!

01:02:38.189 --> 01:02:42.497
Then, and only then,
will I let you die.

01:02:42.671 --> 01:02:44.804
Murderer!

01:02:44.978 --> 01:02:46.284
- [groaning]
- [Héra gasps]

01:02:46.458 --> 01:02:48.242
[Héra] No! No! No!

01:02:50.810 --> 01:02:52.290
- [Héra gasping]
- [guard 1] Sire!

01:02:52.464 --> 01:02:54.031
[Héra] No! No!

01:02:54.205 --> 01:02:55.641
- [guard 2] My lord! Quickly!
- [Olwyn] Get the king!

01:02:55.815 --> 01:02:57.556
Get him inside! Hurry!

01:02:57.730 --> 01:02:59.166
- [guard 1] Help the king!
- [guard 2] Come on!

01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:00.602
[guard 3] All right! All right!

01:03:00.777 --> 01:03:02.169
- Come. Come inside.
- [Héra grunting]

01:03:02.343 --> 01:03:03.736
[guard 3] I... I've got you!

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:05.869
- Come on!
- [Héra] Please. No!

01:03:06.043 --> 01:03:08.567
[warriors shouting
in distance]

01:03:10.177 --> 01:03:12.136
[shouting continues]

01:03:15.356 --> 01:03:17.141
Close the gates!

01:03:17.315 --> 01:03:19.186
Close the gates!

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:22.799
- [whirring]
- [guards shouting]

01:03:22.973 --> 01:03:24.931
Prepare the men for a siege.

01:03:25.932 --> 01:03:28.543
Sire, winter is coming on.

01:03:28.717 --> 01:03:30.545
A siege will cost both sides.

01:03:30.719 --> 01:03:33.026
I don't care what it costs!

01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.159
Surround the keep.

01:03:35.333 --> 01:03:38.771
If anyone tries to escape,
even a rat, kill it.

01:03:39.337 --> 01:03:41.208
[sighs]

01:03:41.382 --> 01:03:42.906
What of the boy's body?

01:03:43.080 --> 01:03:45.343
[breathing heavily]

01:03:47.345 --> 01:03:48.694
[Wulf] Let it rot.

01:03:53.655 --> 01:03:55.266
[gates clang shut]

01:04:02.969 --> 01:04:04.362
[crying]

01:04:04.536 --> 01:04:06.494
[mournful music playing]

01:04:10.672 --> 01:04:12.109
- [Lief] My lady?
- [sniffles]

01:04:15.329 --> 01:04:16.896
You're needed, my lady.

01:04:18.376 --> 01:04:20.247
[sniffles]

01:04:23.250 --> 01:04:25.122
[warriors shouting]

01:04:27.298 --> 01:04:29.256
[shouting continues
indistinctly]

01:04:45.577 --> 01:04:46.708
[Fréaláf] Any word?

01:04:46.883 --> 01:04:49.537
[soldier] I'm sorry, milord.

01:04:49.711 --> 01:04:52.279
[EÉowyn] <i>High in the stronghold
of Dunharrow,</i>

01:04:52.453 --> 01:04:54.716
<i>Fréaláf waited.</i>

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:57.894
<i>Yet the fate of his kin
remained unknown.</i>

01:04:59.330 --> 01:05:01.680
<i>Had they survived?</i>

01:05:01.854 --> 01:05:05.771
<i>Or were they buried now
amongst the ashes of Edoras?</i>

01:05:05.945 --> 01:05:07.555
[crows cawing]

01:05:33.930 --> 01:05:34.931
Hmm...

01:05:36.367 --> 01:05:38.325
[eerie, suspenseful
music playing]

01:05:39.022 --> 01:05:39.979
[thuds]

01:05:43.243 --> 01:05:45.506
Summon the lords
of Rohan to Edoras.

01:05:46.986 --> 01:05:49.554
It's time they swear
their loyalty to me.

01:05:49.728 --> 01:05:52.644
The king who last wore
that crown still lives.

01:05:54.646 --> 01:05:58.041
Helm Hammerhand is but
a shadow of what he once was.

01:05:58.215 --> 01:06:00.304
He will perish soon enough.

01:06:01.783 --> 01:06:03.176
Fear not, Targg.

01:06:04.569 --> 01:06:06.527
Shadows cannot hurt you.

01:06:10.662 --> 01:06:12.316
Return to the Hornburg.

01:06:17.495 --> 01:06:21.194
She thinks she is safe
behind those walls.

01:06:21.368 --> 01:06:22.979
She will learn soon enough.

01:06:23.892 --> 01:06:25.938
She is mistaken.

01:06:29.811 --> 01:06:31.291
[Héra] We have a chance,

01:06:31.465 --> 01:06:33.641
if we can just outlast
Wulf's army.

01:06:40.866 --> 01:06:42.737
This is all of it?

01:06:42.911 --> 01:06:44.478
It's not enough.

01:06:44.652 --> 01:06:46.959
Search all the rooms.
Take stock of everything.

01:06:53.792 --> 01:06:55.707
[clinking, footsteps]

01:06:59.798 --> 01:07:01.843
[mysterious music playing]

01:07:22.081 --> 01:07:23.169
[Olwyn] What's that?

01:07:24.779 --> 01:07:29.436
I've been keeper of
these halls for 40 years.

01:07:29.610 --> 01:07:32.831
I never thought
I'd see such times.

01:07:35.660 --> 01:07:41.057
Supplies are running
terribly low.

01:07:41.231 --> 01:07:43.494
It's going to be
a long winter.

01:07:43.668 --> 01:07:46.062
I can feel it in my bones.

01:07:46.236 --> 01:07:47.715
- [gasps]
- [Olwyn] Hmm.

01:07:53.330 --> 01:07:56.985
[shrieks] Don't touch that,
my lady.

01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.726
[groans]

01:07:58.900 --> 01:08:02.687
That gown was made for a bride

01:08:02.861 --> 01:08:05.907
that was pledged to
the captain of the keep.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:09.085
But she never got to wear it.

01:08:09.259 --> 01:08:15.874
A strange fever took her
the night before her wedding.

01:08:16.048 --> 01:08:20.922
Some say many a lost soul
wanders these halls.

01:08:21.793 --> 01:08:24.665
And worse.

01:08:26.885 --> 01:08:28.539
Who says it?

01:08:30.889 --> 01:08:32.325
I do.

01:08:33.979 --> 01:08:35.067
Nonsense.

01:08:36.851 --> 01:08:39.506
- [keys jangling]
- Here, give me that.

01:08:47.123 --> 01:08:49.429
[Fryght] I've tried
to send for help.

01:08:49.603 --> 01:08:51.692
All our messenger birds
are shot down.

01:08:51.866 --> 01:08:53.955
None can get past
their archers.

01:08:54.130 --> 01:08:56.784
What other choice is there
but to submit?

01:08:56.958 --> 01:08:58.786
[Pryme] Don't be a fool.

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.962
There will be no surrender,

01:09:01.137 --> 01:09:02.660
only slaughter.

01:09:04.488 --> 01:09:06.838
We've barely any food or fuel.

01:09:07.012 --> 01:09:08.318
The other lords of Rohan

01:09:08.492 --> 01:09:10.624
have retreated
to their strongholds.

01:09:10.798 --> 01:09:12.931
We are cut off!

01:09:13.105 --> 01:09:14.672
How are we to survive?

01:09:14.846 --> 01:09:16.108
[Héra] We find a way.

01:09:16.891 --> 01:09:18.415
[gate creaking]

01:09:18.589 --> 01:09:20.460
We cannot fight
amongst ourselves.

01:09:20.634 --> 01:09:23.637
That is exactly
what he wants us to do.

01:09:23.811 --> 01:09:27.075
Despair is Wulf's
greatest weapon against us.

01:09:27.250 --> 01:09:29.121
We cannot succumb.

01:09:29.295 --> 01:09:32.864
We find a way to survive,
and we do it together.

01:09:35.432 --> 01:09:36.824
[sighs]

01:09:47.531 --> 01:09:51.317
[Fryght] Pretty words.
Pretty words will not save us.

01:09:55.452 --> 01:09:57.932
[somber music playing]

01:10:16.647 --> 01:10:17.952
[indistinct chatter]

01:10:21.391 --> 01:10:22.609
Thank you.

01:10:23.697 --> 01:10:25.569
[men shouting in distance]

01:10:25.743 --> 01:10:27.527
[guard 1] Here!
Come take a look at this!

01:10:27.701 --> 01:10:29.660
[somber music playing]

01:10:31.314 --> 01:10:32.619
[guard 2] What are they
doing down there?

01:10:32.793 --> 01:10:34.752
[men screaming]

01:10:39.017 --> 01:10:40.236
What are they doing?

01:10:44.501 --> 01:10:46.242
[shouting continuing]

01:10:51.943 --> 01:10:53.814
He's building a siege tower.

01:10:53.988 --> 01:10:55.642
He means to breach the walls.

01:10:58.123 --> 01:11:00.125
[indistinct conversation]

01:11:00.299 --> 01:11:02.301
[eagle screeches]

01:11:14.835 --> 01:11:17.055
[EÉowyn] <i>It is not easy
to hold on to hope</i>

01:11:17.229 --> 01:11:18.926
<i>when an ill wind blows.</i>

01:11:20.493 --> 01:11:23.148
<i>Winter bit hard that year.</i>

01:11:23.322 --> 01:11:25.977
<i>None were spared
the endless cold.</i>

01:11:26.151 --> 01:11:29.154
<i>Yet still the siege held fast.</i>

01:11:29.328 --> 01:11:32.288
<i>The Rohirrim could do nothing
but watch and wait,</i>

01:11:32.462 --> 01:11:34.942
<i>as their doom drew ever near.</i>

01:11:35.116 --> 01:11:36.379
[Héra breathes deeply]

01:11:36.553 --> 01:11:37.728
[sighs] Any change?

01:11:37.902 --> 01:11:39.860
[Olwyn] It makes no sense.

01:11:40.034 --> 01:11:44.125
His body is mending,
and yet he does not wake.

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.389
I fear it is his mind
that is broken.

01:11:58.314 --> 01:12:00.011
- [gasps softly]
- [bowls clang]

01:12:07.410 --> 01:12:09.063
[Lief blowing]

01:12:15.548 --> 01:12:18.377
What are you doing?
That's for the king.

01:12:18.551 --> 01:12:20.031
[Pennicruik] Hmm.

01:12:20.205 --> 01:12:22.512
[Pennicruik groans]

01:12:24.514 --> 01:12:26.298
What about that?

01:12:27.995 --> 01:12:29.954
What? No, not that.

01:12:30.128 --> 01:12:31.129
[Héra] Take it.

01:12:32.304 --> 01:12:33.871
But, my lady...

01:12:35.873 --> 01:12:37.570
that was Master Háma's.

01:12:37.744 --> 01:12:39.485
[Héra] And what use is it
without him?

01:12:39.659 --> 01:12:42.488
[soft, melancholic
music playing]

01:12:42.662 --> 01:12:43.707
[Pennicruik] Ah.

01:12:45.448 --> 01:12:47.101
[Helm groans]

01:12:47.275 --> 01:12:48.276
[Héra gasps]

01:12:51.454 --> 01:12:55.849
I know this sickness is not
born of any mortal wound.

01:12:58.591 --> 01:13:00.898
It is grief
that pulls you under.

01:13:02.943 --> 01:13:07.339
Grief that you will
never again see your sons.

01:13:10.864 --> 01:13:12.562
[voice trembling]
You think all is lost.

01:13:15.478 --> 01:13:18.655
But I am here, Father.

01:13:18.829 --> 01:13:19.743
[sniffles]

01:13:19.917 --> 01:13:21.962
I am still here.

01:13:23.616 --> 01:13:25.313
Please don't give up.

01:13:25.488 --> 01:13:27.533
[whimpering]

01:13:31.058 --> 01:13:34.279

[wind whooshing]

01:13:52.471 --> 01:13:55.039
- Huh? [exclaims]
- [eerie music playing]

01:13:55.213 --> 01:13:56.649
Who's out there?

01:13:57.737 --> 01:13:59.130
Show yourself!

01:14:01.959 --> 01:14:04.091
[gasps. Exclaiming]

01:14:04.265 --> 01:14:06.920
[screaming]

01:14:07.094 --> 01:14:09.314
[men shouting in distance]

01:14:09.488 --> 01:14:11.534

[men shouting fearfully]

01:14:16.103 --> 01:14:17.278
[groans]

01:14:18.279 --> 01:14:19.411
What happened here?

01:14:19.585 --> 01:14:20.760
[man gasping]

01:14:20.934 --> 01:14:21.848
Speak!

01:14:22.022 --> 01:14:25.678
He killed them all. I saw.

01:14:25.852 --> 01:14:28.333
He tore them apart
with his bare hands.

01:14:28.507 --> 01:14:29.682
Who did?

01:14:29.856 --> 01:14:31.728
Helm Hammerhand.

01:14:31.902 --> 01:14:33.730
He's no living man.

01:14:33.904 --> 01:14:36.472
It's not natural,
the thing I saw.

01:14:36.646 --> 01:14:38.561
He's coming for us all!

01:14:38.735 --> 01:14:40.650
[mysterious music playing]

01:14:40.824 --> 01:14:42.303
[Targg panting]

01:14:48.005 --> 01:14:49.093
Save us.

01:14:53.314 --> 01:14:54.315
[grunts]

01:14:59.277 --> 01:15:01.279
[gasps] Father?

01:15:01.453 --> 01:15:03.890
- [gasping]
- [mysterious music playing]

01:15:08.155 --> 01:15:09.330
Father?

01:15:10.941 --> 01:15:13.204
[horn blowing]

01:15:13.378 --> 01:15:14.814
[EÉowyn] <i>Night after night,</i>

01:15:14.988 --> 01:15:17.208

[horn blowing]

01:15:19.558 --> 01:15:21.560
<i>A harbinger of death.</i>

01:15:21.734 --> 01:15:24.476
<i>Fear took hold of Wulf's men.</i>

01:15:24.650 --> 01:15:26.870
<i>Whispers spread that
Helm Hammerhand</i>

01:15:27.044 --> 01:15:29.089
<i>was human no more.</i>

01:15:29.263 --> 01:15:33.616
<i>He bore no weapon,
and no weapon could smite him.</i>

01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:37.358
<i>A terror born of madness
and grief.</i>

01:15:38.272 --> 01:15:39.186
<i>A wraith.</i>

01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:41.624
[horn blowing]

01:15:41.798 --> 01:15:44.757
- [men grunting]
- [wind blowing]

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:52.417
<i>Wulf returned to a camp
stalked by death,</i>

01:15:52.591 --> 01:15:55.246
<i>his carefully-laid plans
in disarray.</i>

01:15:56.943 --> 01:15:58.989
<i>He was king of nothing.</i>

01:15:59.163 --> 01:16:01.992
[wood creaking]

01:16:02.166 --> 01:16:06.039
<i>But Wulf, son of Freca,</i>

01:16:06.213 --> 01:16:09.695
<i>would be damned before he was
defeated by a ghost.</i>

01:16:11.305 --> 01:16:13.612
- [villagers coughing]
- [somber music playing]

01:16:13.786 --> 01:16:15.658
- Is it true what they say?
- [child coughs]

01:16:15.832 --> 01:16:16.789
What?

01:16:16.963 --> 01:16:18.486
Has the king become a monster?

01:16:18.661 --> 01:16:20.663
[somber music playing]

01:16:20.837 --> 01:16:23.274
[Pennicruik] A terrible,
unholy sight.

01:16:23.448 --> 01:16:29.062
Eyes that burn like coals
as he feasts on the flesh...

01:16:29.236 --> 01:16:32.544
[Olwyn] Helm Hammerhand
is no wraith.

01:16:32.718 --> 01:16:34.764
[Pennicruik]
Then how did he disappear

01:16:34.938 --> 01:16:37.114
from a locked
and guarded room?

01:16:37.288 --> 01:16:38.985
Answer me that.

01:16:39.159 --> 01:16:43.816
I don't know. But I do know
he can't walk through walls!

01:16:43.990 --> 01:16:45.949
[Pennicruik] Perhaps he can.

01:16:46.123 --> 01:16:48.952
Perhaps he can do
many unnatural things.

01:16:49.126 --> 01:16:50.693
[Olwyn] Oh, aye? Such as what?

01:16:50.867 --> 01:16:53.521
[Pennicruik] First comes
the sound of the horn.

01:16:53.696 --> 01:16:55.349
Three blasts.

01:16:55.523 --> 01:16:59.266
Then he appears,
fierce and gaunt,

01:16:59.440 --> 01:17:01.573
stalking his prey!

01:17:01.747 --> 01:17:04.271
The only ghoul haunting
these halls is you!

[Héra] Olwyn, can you hear me?

01:17:14.978 --> 01:17:16.370
[silence]

01:17:17.023 --> 01:17:18.198
Héra?

01:17:19.460 --> 01:17:20.548
Where's she gone?

01:17:22.507 --> 01:17:23.639

01:18:08.858 --> 01:18:10.511
The bodies.

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:12.296
They're gone!

01:18:12.470 --> 01:18:15.125
The wraith! It's eaten them.

01:18:15.299 --> 01:18:18.128
It's eaten them all!

01:18:18.302 --> 01:18:20.130
[warrior] I told you!
We shouldn't be here!

I don't like them ginger ones.

with rings anyway?

[Shank] Hey, the less I know,
the better.

01:20:30.869 --> 01:20:31.827
[Wrot] Hmm.

[sniffs] You smell that?

They can smell you
from Mount Doom.

No. No.

[Héra] No!

01:21:02.553 --> 01:21:04.033
[Wrot] We got ourselves
a live one.

01:21:04.207 --> 01:21:05.861
[Shank] Not much meat on her.

01:21:06.035 --> 01:21:08.341
May as well feed her
to the beast.

[warrior] It's the wraith.

[groans softly]

01:22:47.832 --> 01:22:50.443
[sinister music playing]

01:22:52.184 --> 01:22:53.359
Huh...

01:22:55.448 --> 01:22:57.102
[gasps]

01:22:58.495 --> 01:22:59.452
[Helm] Héra...

01:23:02.064 --> 01:23:03.717
I'm sorry, child.

01:23:03.891 --> 01:23:05.328
I'm so sorry.

01:23:09.114 --> 01:23:10.811
I thought I'd lost you.

01:23:12.726 --> 01:23:14.990
I was trying to protect you.

01:23:17.340 --> 01:23:20.169
You can't tear Wulf's army
apart one man at a time.

01:23:23.085 --> 01:23:24.608
I can try.

01:23:25.957 --> 01:23:28.351
I should have listened to you.

01:23:28.525 --> 01:23:30.788
You're brave and clever,

01:23:30.962 --> 01:23:32.659
and stronger than I knew.

01:23:33.921 --> 01:23:36.141
And I was blind not to see it.

01:23:38.317 --> 01:23:39.666
I've failed you.

01:23:40.450 --> 01:23:41.364
All of you.

01:23:41.538 --> 01:23:43.975
No.

01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:47.500
Everything you've ever done
was for Rohan.

01:23:47.674 --> 01:23:49.198
For those you love.

01:23:51.069 --> 01:23:53.115
When I was little,
you told me,

01:23:53.289 --> 01:23:55.465
"You only fail
when you stop trying."

01:23:56.379 --> 01:23:57.902
You never gave up.

01:23:58.076 --> 01:23:59.034
Never.

01:24:04.517 --> 01:24:06.258
[sighs]

01:24:06.432 --> 01:24:08.347
[wind blowing]

01:24:11.481 --> 01:24:12.786
You're freezing.

01:24:18.270 --> 01:24:20.316
Come on, move!

01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:22.057
- [tense music playing]
- [gasps]

01:24:22.231 --> 01:24:25.277
[Helm] Come. We have to make
a break for the gates.

01:24:25.451 --> 01:24:27.279
It's the only way back in.

01:24:29.586 --> 01:24:31.370
[both panting]

01:24:35.592 --> 01:24:37.115

01:25:16.633 --> 01:25:18.591
[Héra] Help!

01:25:18.765 --> 01:25:20.463
- What is that?
- [Héra] Open the gates!

01:25:21.464 --> 01:25:23.248
Open the gates!

01:25:24.684 --> 01:25:25.990
It's the king!

01:25:26.164 --> 01:25:27.948
Open the gates!

01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:29.515
Open them!

01:25:29.689 --> 01:25:31.517
- [wood creaking]
- [guards grunting]

01:25:34.694 --> 01:25:37.523

01:26:08.598 --> 01:26:10.208
The gate is stuck!

01:26:12.602 --> 01:26:14.560
[heroic music playing]

01:26:16.171 --> 01:26:17.694

- [Héra] They're coming.
- [warriors screaming]

01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:54.078
- [swords clattering]
- Hurry!

01:26:56.646 --> 01:26:57.603
Hurry!

01:27:01.564 --> 01:27:03.174
[Olwyn breathing heavily]

01:27:04.741 --> 01:27:06.264
[grunting]

01:27:07.439 --> 01:27:09.354
What are you doing? No.

01:27:09.528 --> 01:27:11.574
No! [sobs] please!

01:27:12.357 --> 01:27:13.358
I need you.

01:27:14.403 --> 01:27:16.318
Rohan still needs you.

01:27:16.492 --> 01:27:18.320
No, Héra,

01:27:18.494 --> 01:27:20.365
they need you.

01:27:20.539 --> 01:27:22.280
You must lead them now.

01:27:22.889 --> 01:27:24.239
I can't.

01:27:24.413 --> 01:27:26.066
[wind blowing]

01:27:30.288 --> 01:27:31.246
You can.

01:27:32.377 --> 01:27:34.988
You are a daughter of kings.

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:37.904
The day you were born,

01:27:38.078 --> 01:27:39.254
I was brought to my knees.

01:27:41.212 --> 01:27:42.387
My pride...

01:27:43.562 --> 01:27:44.650
my joy.

01:27:46.130 --> 01:27:49.133
You could rule the world.

01:27:55.052 --> 01:27:56.009
[Héra] [sobbing] No.

01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:59.491

[screaming] Father! [sobs]

01:28:12.678 --> 01:28:14.158
- Come away, child!
- Father!

01:28:14.332 --> 01:28:16.291
[Olwyn] Come away
before you freeze to death!

01:28:18.380 --> 01:28:20.033

[mournful music playing]

01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:35.266
Is there no one left?

01:28:36.659 --> 01:28:40.053
Is there no one left
to face me?

01:28:40.227 --> 01:28:42.578
[dramatic music playing]

01:28:43.666 --> 01:28:44.580

[Targg] Fall back!

01:28:55.721 --> 01:28:57.810
Sire! Come away!

01:28:57.984 --> 01:29:00.422
You'll die out here!

01:29:00.596 --> 01:29:03.076
- [Helm] Not while I live!
- [sighs]

01:29:03.250 --> 01:29:05.644
Do you hear me, Wulf?

01:29:05.818 --> 01:29:07.342
By my life,

01:29:07.516 --> 01:29:09.822
Rohan still stands.

01:29:11.171 --> 01:29:13.043
Helm Hammerhand

01:29:13.870 --> 01:29:17.352
still stands!

01:30:15.410 --> 01:30:17.412
<i>still standing guard</i>

01:30:17.586 --> 01:30:19.370
<i>before the gates
of the Hornburg.</i>

01:30:20.458 --> 01:30:21.894
<i>His will unbroken,</i>

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:24.941
<i>his knees unbent.</i>

[somber, mournful
music playing]

01:31:04.197 --> 01:31:05.198
[Targg] Dead?

01:31:08.463 --> 01:31:11.466
I'll give the order
to call off the siege.

01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:13.555
We can decamp and be
out of here within the week.

01:31:14.730 --> 01:31:16.732
We are not going anywhere.

01:31:18.211 --> 01:31:19.952
You have won.

01:31:20.126 --> 01:31:21.606
There is nothing
left to conquer

01:31:21.780 --> 01:31:23.652
but a group
of starving refugees.

01:31:25.262 --> 01:31:28.831
Sire, you need to look
to your own people.

01:31:29.005 --> 01:31:30.223
They are suffering.

01:31:31.703 --> 01:31:35.228
This long winter
has taken its toll.

01:31:35.402 --> 01:31:37.622
Your stores of gold
are all but gone.

01:31:38.754 --> 01:31:40.146
I implore you,

01:31:41.365 --> 01:31:42.801
abandon this place.

01:31:42.975 --> 01:31:45.412
Do you think
I want to be here?

01:31:45.587 --> 01:31:48.328
Stuck in this filthy,
forsaken valley?

01:31:49.416 --> 01:31:51.418
I cannot leave!

01:31:51.593 --> 01:31:54.552
Don't you understand?
This is all I have.

01:31:54.726 --> 01:31:56.032
Without vengeance,

01:31:56.206 --> 01:31:57.947
this will have been
for nothing.

01:31:59.078 --> 01:32:00.950
[sinister music playing]

01:32:01.124 --> 01:32:02.299
No.

01:32:02.473 --> 01:32:04.083
We cannot show weakness.

01:32:06.042 --> 01:32:07.217
Not to her.

01:32:09.872 --> 01:32:12.048
This keep will be her tomb.

01:32:22.624 --> 01:32:24.756
How long do you think we have?

01:32:24.930 --> 01:32:26.758
A few days
before he breaches the walls.

01:32:26.932 --> 01:32:28.238
We cannot fight him.

01:32:29.413 --> 01:32:30.849
We cannot call for aid.

01:32:32.851 --> 01:32:35.854
[sighs] Even if we could,
who would answer now?

01:32:38.944 --> 01:32:40.337
I'm afraid, Olwyn.

01:32:41.686 --> 01:32:42.861
I cannot save them.

01:32:45.211 --> 01:32:47.997
Perhaps not. But there is
something you can do.

01:32:49.607 --> 01:32:50.913
You can choose.

01:32:53.916 --> 01:32:55.918
You ask who would come
if you called for aid?

01:32:57.702 --> 01:32:59.138
Rohan would answer.

01:32:59.312 --> 01:33:00.270
[breath trembling]

01:33:01.488 --> 01:33:03.403
People need hope, Héra.

01:33:04.448 --> 01:33:06.058
Something to believe in,

01:33:06.232 --> 01:33:09.235
no matter how out of reach
it may be.

01:33:09.409 --> 01:33:11.194
So, you can wait and worry,

01:33:11.368 --> 01:33:12.717
or you can choose.

01:33:12.891 --> 01:33:15.590
You can choose how this ends.

01:33:16.895 --> 01:33:19.245

[Lief grunting]

01:33:59.721 --> 01:34:01.679
[dramatic music playing]

01:34:06.118 --> 01:34:07.598
[Olwyn] This is your plan?

01:34:07.772 --> 01:34:09.426
[Héra] I never said
it was a good one.

01:34:10.253 --> 01:34:11.341
[exhales]

01:34:12.211 --> 01:34:13.430
[Lief panting]

01:34:20.437 --> 01:34:25.224
Not that I mind carrying this
up 898 steps, my lady,

01:34:25.398 --> 01:34:28.184
but why do you need
your father's armor?

01:34:28.358 --> 01:34:29.489
[Héra] My father's
helmet and horn

01:34:29.664 --> 01:34:30.708
are known throughout the land.

01:34:32.579 --> 01:34:34.103
Why do I need
the king's armor, Lief?

01:34:35.974 --> 01:34:36.932
For hope.

01:34:39.108 --> 01:34:40.370
Hope?

01:34:40.544 --> 01:34:41.676
Don't ask.

01:34:44.374 --> 01:34:46.071
If I don't come back,
will you look after...

01:34:46.245 --> 01:34:48.726
Right, enough of that talk.
You're coming back.

I have read that
the Great Eagles

01:36:40.359 --> 01:36:43.145
can understand
the common tongue of men.

01:36:43.319 --> 01:36:46.104
- [squawks]
- [breath trembling]

01:36:46.278 --> 01:36:49.107
Please, I beg of you.

01:36:50.848 --> 01:36:52.371
I need your help.

01:36:53.503 --> 01:36:55.940
My people need your help.

01:37:04.296 --> 01:37:06.733
[Lief grunting]

01:37:11.129 --> 01:37:12.304
[screeches]

01:37:13.088 --> 01:37:14.176
[Lief gasps]

01:37:14.350 --> 01:37:15.351
[grunts]

01:37:17.179 --> 01:37:19.877
[breathing heavily]

01:37:20.051 --> 01:37:21.313
- [eagle screeches]
- [dramatic music playing]

01:37:25.491 --> 01:37:26.928
[commander] We've had enough!

01:37:27.102 --> 01:37:28.973
Where's the money
we were promised?

01:37:29.147 --> 01:37:31.019
This isn't about money.

01:37:31.193 --> 01:37:32.803
Your mission is
to take that fortress

01:37:32.977 --> 01:37:35.545
so we can end this damn war!

01:37:35.719 --> 01:37:38.200
We care not
for your stone towers.

01:37:39.114 --> 01:37:40.202
[Wulf] You should.

01:37:40.898 --> 01:37:42.334
[coins jingling]

01:37:43.770 --> 01:37:45.294
[indistinct conversation]

01:37:45.468 --> 01:37:49.341
That fortress is full of
such riches. Room upon room.

01:37:49.515 --> 01:37:51.691
[all whispering]

01:37:51.866 --> 01:37:55.347
Those miserable rebels inside
that keep cannot use it.

01:37:55.521 --> 01:37:58.742
They cannot burn it.
They cannot eat it.

01:38:00.439 --> 01:38:03.312
- It's yours, all of it.
- [men laughing]

01:38:03.486 --> 01:38:06.793
- Yours for the taking.
- [all talking excitedly]

01:38:06.968 --> 01:38:08.708
- [coins jingling]
- [Wulf chuckles]

01:38:08.883 --> 01:38:10.885
[tense music playing]

01:38:23.071 --> 01:38:24.811
What are you doing?

01:38:24.986 --> 01:38:27.640
The Hornburg has never
been used to store gold!

01:38:29.904 --> 01:38:31.340
But they don't know that,
do they?

01:38:34.386 --> 01:38:35.822
[men shouting indistinctly]

01:38:39.087 --> 01:38:42.003
We can wait no longer.
Give the order.

01:38:42.177 --> 01:38:44.744
Right, you lot.
You heard Lord Fréaláf,

01:38:44.919 --> 01:38:46.790
time to abandon Dunharrow.

01:38:46.964 --> 01:38:49.532
We make for Gondor
at first light.

01:38:49.706 --> 01:38:51.534
- [eagle screeches]
- [gasps]

01:38:56.321 --> 01:38:58.280
[suspenseful music playing]

01:39:03.328 --> 01:39:04.286
[rhythmic drum beating]

01:39:08.768 --> 01:39:11.293
[Wildmen chanting]

01:39:18.909 --> 01:39:20.606
[Wulf] Leave none alive!

01:39:21.433 --> 01:39:23.392
Kill them all!

01:39:23.566 --> 01:39:26.656
He's moving the siege tower!
We're out of time.

01:39:27.874 --> 01:39:29.267
Then all is lost!

01:39:29.441 --> 01:39:31.400
[Héra] On the contrary.

01:39:31.574 --> 01:39:35.839
An attack gives us a chance,
one small chance, to escape.

01:39:38.059 --> 01:39:39.843
Wulf will throw everything
at us, which means...

01:39:40.017 --> 01:39:43.107
His camp will be empty.

01:39:43.281 --> 01:39:45.327
If we can clear
the secret tunnel,

01:39:45.501 --> 01:39:48.025
our people can reach
the mountain pass.

01:39:48.199 --> 01:39:50.114
From there,
they can make for Dunharrow.

01:39:50.288 --> 01:39:52.987
It's too risky.
Wulf will see us.

01:39:54.684 --> 01:39:56.294
No, he won't.

01:39:57.817 --> 01:39:59.950
Because his eye
will be fixed on me.

01:40:00.124 --> 01:40:01.908
[somber music playing]

01:40:13.529 --> 01:40:14.791
[Héra] Are you ready?

01:40:14.965 --> 01:40:15.879
Yes.

01:40:16.053 --> 01:40:17.141
[Héra] Good.

01:40:21.015 --> 01:40:22.451
Where are we going?

01:40:22.625 --> 01:40:23.887
Somewhere safe.

01:40:28.022 --> 01:40:29.588
Are your soldiers ready?

01:40:29.762 --> 01:40:31.590
Aye, they are.

01:40:31.764 --> 01:40:33.462
We'll get them to Dunharrow.

01:40:33.636 --> 01:40:35.246
Or die trying.

01:40:36.552 --> 01:40:37.553
Shh.

01:40:39.642 --> 01:40:41.644
[all talking indistinctly]

01:40:54.483 --> 01:40:55.832
[gasps]

01:40:56.006 --> 01:40:57.138
[Héra] Lief?

01:40:59.749 --> 01:41:02.230
No. No, this is all wrong.

01:41:03.231 --> 01:41:04.623
I'm your guard, miss.

01:41:04.797 --> 01:41:07.191
I want to fight by your side
till the end.

01:41:11.369 --> 01:41:14.242
I need you to protect
what is most important.

01:41:15.591 --> 01:41:17.854
I need you to protect
our people.

01:41:20.639 --> 01:41:22.163
[Héra sighs]

01:41:22.337 --> 01:41:23.729
Well, go on with you then.

01:41:25.427 --> 01:41:26.689
A straight line, mind you.

01:41:26.863 --> 01:41:28.604
Don't be leading them
in circles.

01:41:29.996 --> 01:41:31.259
[breath trembling]

01:41:35.132 --> 01:41:36.090
[gulps]

01:41:41.530 --> 01:41:42.661
[sighs]

01:41:42.835 --> 01:41:44.837
[tense music playing]

01:41:46.187 --> 01:41:47.188
[sighs]

01:41:50.147 --> 01:41:52.236
[rhythmic drum beating]

01:41:56.110 --> 01:41:57.459
[men groaning]

01:41:57.633 --> 01:42:01.463
- [men shouting]
- [horn blowing]

01:42:08.687 --> 01:42:11.342
[indistinct shouting]

01:42:38.108 --> 01:42:41.720
He wanted a bride
and so a bride he shall have.

01:42:46.116 --> 01:42:47.248
It's time.

01:42:49.250 --> 01:42:53.384
I swore to your father,
from your very first breath,

01:42:53.558 --> 01:42:55.430
that I would always be
by your side.

01:42:55.604 --> 01:42:58.824
[sniffles] I swear it still.

01:42:58.998 --> 01:43:02.306
- To my very last.
- [chuckles]

01:43:02.480 --> 01:43:04.961
[Olwyn] What's so funny?
Why are you laughing?

01:43:08.225 --> 01:43:10.096
- [kisses]
- Uh...

01:43:10.271 --> 01:43:12.011
Because I get to choose...

01:43:13.665 --> 01:43:16.102
and I choose not to be afraid.

01:43:16.277 --> 01:43:20.411
[sighs loudly]
Ride strong, child.

01:43:26.983 --> 01:43:29.203
- [rumbling]
- [all gasp]

01:43:34.164 --> 01:43:35.296
- [woman crying]
- let's go.

01:43:36.862 --> 01:43:39.387
We can't go out there!
They'll catch us!

01:43:40.301 --> 01:43:41.954
No, they won't.

01:43:42.128 --> 01:43:44.914
Someone stayed behind
to make sure they wouldn't,

01:43:45.088 --> 01:43:46.220
to protect us.

01:43:47.177 --> 01:43:48.831
Who did?

01:43:49.005 --> 01:43:51.747
Have you ever heard
of the Shieldmaidens?

01:43:52.356 --> 01:43:53.531
No.

01:43:53.705 --> 01:43:55.794
They were women
of The Borderlands.

01:43:55.968 --> 01:43:58.406
[heroic music playing]

01:44:00.582 --> 01:44:02.932
<i>When all the soldiers
had died,</i>

01:44:03.106 --> 01:44:05.282
<i>they took up arms.</i>

01:44:05.456 --> 01:44:09.634
<i>They defended Rohan
when no one else could.</i>

01:44:09.808 --> 01:44:12.942
<i>Some believe
they're all gone now.</i>

01:44:13.116 --> 01:44:14.073
[child] <i>Are they?</i>

01:44:16.032 --> 01:44:17.251
[Lief] <i>Not all of them.</i>

01:44:22.821 --> 01:44:25.128
[horse whinnies]

01:44:25.302 --> 01:44:27.304
[heroic music

[rhythmic drum beating]

01:45:03.601 --> 01:45:04.820
- [Wildmen screaming]
- [rope whipping]

01:45:06.952 --> 01:45:09.215
[wood creaking]

01:45:13.394 --> 01:45:15.047
[sinister music playing]

01:45:21.619 --> 01:45:23.142
[screaming]

01:45:28.931 --> 01:45:30.889
[sinister music

01:45:35.111 --> 01:45:36.895
[horse whinnies]

01:45:40.029 --> 01:45:41.335
Advance!

01:45:44.729 --> 01:45:46.644
[all screaming]

01:45:49.995 --> 01:45:51.214
[neighing]

01:45:55.131 --> 01:45:56.524
[Targg] Hold!

01:45:57.829 --> 01:45:58.787
[whinnies]

01:46:09.928 --> 01:46:11.321
What is this?

01:46:15.281 --> 01:46:17.675
You come before me as a bride?

01:46:17.849 --> 01:46:20.591
You think, after everything,
I would marry you?

01:46:20.765 --> 01:46:23.464
[Héra] I am bride to no man.

01:46:23.638 --> 01:46:26.945
[Wulf] Tell me then.
To whom are you pledged?

01:46:28.947 --> 01:46:30.688
[heroic music playing]

01:46:30.862 --> 01:46:31.820
Death.

01:46:33.256 --> 01:46:35.563
Let us end this, Wulf,

01:46:35.737 --> 01:46:40.568
as it began, with you and I.

01:46:40.742 --> 01:46:44.833
If I best you in combat,
you let my people go.

01:46:45.007 --> 01:46:47.226
[Wulf] Why would I agree
to such terms?

01:46:47.401 --> 01:46:50.055
You have nothing to offer me.

01:46:50.229 --> 01:46:52.928
You may wear a crown
upon your head,

01:46:53.102 --> 01:46:56.366
but that does not
make you a king.

01:46:56.540 --> 01:47:00.065
I am the last of the true
bloodline of Rohan.

01:47:00.239 --> 01:47:02.285
I offer you a chance
to prove yourself

01:47:02.459 --> 01:47:04.592
worthy of that throne.

01:47:04.766 --> 01:47:07.986
You were too much of a coward
to face my father.

01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:12.077
- So, face me now.
- [exhales]

01:47:12.251 --> 01:47:15.167
[Targg] The girl is clever.
She is up to something.

01:47:15.341 --> 01:47:17.169
Do not take the bait.

01:47:20.738 --> 01:47:23.393
I accept your challenge.

01:47:23.567 --> 01:47:25.351
You think I am afraid of you?

01:47:27.745 --> 01:47:29.268
You should be.

01:47:32.271 --> 01:47:33.229
- [yells]
- [neighs]

01:47:37.146 --> 01:47:38.364

- [men grumbling]

- [man 1] This way.
- [man 2 coughing]

01:47:58.428 --> 01:47:59.690
[man 3] Keep moving,
keep moving.

01:48:02.345 --> 01:48:03.955
[all panting, coughing]

01:48:23.322 --> 01:48:24.715

- [grunting]
- [gasps]

01:49:11.588 --> 01:49:13.024
Call off your men.

01:49:15.113 --> 01:49:16.506
You gave me your word.

01:49:26.603 --> 01:49:27.648
I did.

01:49:35.307 --> 01:49:36.570
Launch the attack.

01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:39.529
No.

01:49:40.965 --> 01:49:42.880
The girl was right.

01:49:43.054 --> 01:49:45.622
You're a coward.

01:49:45.796 --> 01:49:48.407
A coward with no honor.
[groaning]

01:49:48.582 --> 01:49:50.584
[grave music playing]

01:49:56.111 --> 01:50:01.595
With or without honor,
men bleed just the same.

01:50:04.510 --> 01:50:06.991
Attack! Attack!

01:50:07.165 --> 01:50:09.559
- [men shouting wildly]
- [Wulf] Leave the girl to me!

01:50:16.566 --> 01:50:17.741
Hold your positions!

01:50:20.614 --> 01:50:22.224
[guard] They're closin' in!

01:50:22.398 --> 01:50:23.965
Move the last group now!

01:50:24.139 --> 01:50:25.357
Go! Hurry!

01:50:26.663 --> 01:50:28.796
You take care of this.

01:50:28.970 --> 01:50:33.452
Our people still have a song
or two left in them yet.

01:50:38.196 --> 01:50:39.807
[men shouting]

01:50:45.551 --> 01:50:46.901
Héra!

01:50:48.554 --> 01:50:50.252
[intense music playing]

01:50:54.865 --> 01:50:56.171
Fire!

01:50:57.215 --> 01:50:58.303
Fire!

01:51:19.716 --> 01:51:21.892
You have lost, Héra.

[somber music playing]

01:51:34.339 --> 01:51:35.645
[all gasping]

01:51:41.869 --> 01:51:43.653
[Wulf] The Hornburg
will fall...

01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:47.352
just like your brothers.

01:51:48.876 --> 01:51:52.357
Just like the great
Helm Hammerhand.

01:51:53.054 --> 01:51:54.011
[gasps]

01:51:56.100 --> 01:51:57.885

01:52:12.900 --> 01:52:14.771
[horn blowing]

01:52:18.035 --> 01:52:19.123
Hammerhand?

01:52:23.954 --> 01:52:24.955
[gasps]

01:52:26.087 --> 01:52:28.045
[triumphant music playing]

01:52:31.614 --> 01:52:33.355
The wraith! The wraith!

01:52:34.356 --> 01:52:35.966
Helm Hammerhand has come!

01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:39.927
The dead are upon us!
Run for your life!

01:52:41.406 --> 01:52:44.235
For Rohan!

01:52:44.409 --> 01:52:47.282
[Fréaláf] Forth Eorlingas!

01:52:48.936 --> 01:52:50.676
[war cry]

01:52:57.335 --> 01:52:58.336
[gasps]

01:53:00.425 --> 01:53:01.687
[men shouting]

01:53:04.516 --> 01:53:06.040
[Héra] Our people
do not call this keep

01:53:06.214 --> 01:53:07.519
the Hornburg anymore.

01:53:08.912 --> 01:53:09.870
[Olwyn] Héra!

01:53:12.263 --> 01:53:14.788
They have named it
for its true king.

01:53:17.051 --> 01:53:18.835
Helm's Deep.

01:53:19.009 --> 01:53:20.706
[panting]

01:53:22.447 --> 01:53:24.754
[men screaming]

01:53:37.898 --> 01:53:40.204
[indistinct shouting]

01:53:42.990 --> 01:53:44.121
[grunts]

01:53:52.826 --> 01:53:53.827
I knew it.

01:53:58.832 --> 01:54:00.050
[grunts]

01:54:00.224 --> 01:54:01.182
[Wulf] From the moment
I first met you,

01:54:01.356 --> 01:54:03.010
I knew you would be my doom.

01:54:05.795 --> 01:54:06.796
[Wulf pants]

01:54:16.371 --> 01:54:17.372
Héra...

01:54:20.157 --> 01:54:21.942
- [yells]
- [grunts]

01:54:23.508 --> 01:54:25.510
[intense music playing]

01:54:27.599 --> 01:54:29.340
[all grunting]

01:54:40.874 --> 01:54:41.875
[Héra grunts]

01:54:44.399 --> 01:54:45.704
[screams]

01:54:45.879 --> 01:54:46.923
[grunting]

01:54:58.848 --> 01:55:00.632
Héra!

01:55:01.416 --> 01:55:02.417
[grunts]

01:55:02.591 --> 01:55:03.897
[both grunting]

01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:14.211
- [intense music playing]
- [grunting]

01:55:16.866 --> 01:55:19.303
- [Héra grunting]
- [groaning]

01:55:22.437 --> 01:55:23.394
[Wulf exhales]

01:55:29.748 --> 01:55:30.967
[sighs, breathes heavily]

01:55:46.896 --> 01:55:48.593
[screaming]

01:55:54.817 --> 01:55:55.774
[Fréaláf] After them!

01:55:57.080 --> 01:55:58.690
Cut off the retreat!

01:55:58.864 --> 01:56:00.040
[horse trotting]

01:56:02.694 --> 01:56:04.609
Héra, you're hurt.

01:56:13.705 --> 01:56:14.706
Let them go.

01:56:17.144 --> 01:56:18.797
Let them return
to their homes,

01:56:19.711 --> 01:56:20.712
their loved ones.

01:56:22.627 --> 01:56:24.586
Rohan has seen enough war.

01:56:25.456 --> 01:56:26.936
Show mercy, cousin.

01:56:28.242 --> 01:56:30.418
Then let mercy rule this day.

01:56:31.854 --> 01:56:33.116
[horn blowing]

01:56:40.689 --> 01:56:42.386
[solemn music playing]

01:56:51.526 --> 01:56:53.093
[sweeping music playing]

01:57:15.941 --> 01:57:16.942
[birds chirping]

01:57:20.903 --> 01:57:22.470
- [girl 1] Can't catch me!
- [girl 2 giggles]

01:57:25.995 --> 01:57:27.605
[mother] Come on, now,
supper's ready!

01:57:27.779 --> 01:57:29.085
[girl 2 laughing]

01:57:33.046 --> 01:57:35.700
[EÉowyn] <i>The long winter
had ended,</i>

01:57:35.874 --> 01:57:38.921
<i>the green promise
of spring had come.</i>

01:57:39.095 --> 01:57:42.446
<i>So began
the second line of kings,</i>

01:57:42.620 --> 01:57:45.101
<i>and the hope
for a more peaceful age.</i>

01:57:46.450 --> 01:57:50.802
Fréaláf Hildeson,
tenth king of Rohan,

01:57:50.976 --> 01:57:53.240
first lord
of the second line...

01:57:54.763 --> 01:57:59.159
I present to you
the new master of Isengard...

01:58:02.423 --> 01:58:04.164
[somber music playing]

01:58:10.170 --> 01:58:12.085
Saruman the White.

01:58:14.348 --> 01:58:17.829
If you should ever be in need
of assistance, my lord.

01:58:23.400 --> 01:58:24.358
[whinnies]

01:58:26.882 --> 01:58:29.145
[Fréaláf] It should have
been you, Héra.

01:58:35.673 --> 01:58:37.719
[sighs] I never
wanted a crown.

01:58:37.893 --> 01:58:39.851
It was always
meant for others.

01:58:40.025 --> 01:58:42.854
Even so,
you would have worn it well.

01:58:44.856 --> 01:58:46.510
I hear
you've received a message.

01:58:48.208 --> 01:58:49.122
Yes. [chuckles]

01:58:49.296 --> 01:58:50.906
An unexpected invitation.

01:58:52.081 --> 01:58:54.866
Of course. Adventure beckons.

01:59:00.959 --> 01:59:02.483
Go well, cousin.

01:59:02.657 --> 01:59:04.615
[soft, joyful music playing]

01:59:10.882 --> 01:59:14.277
But should your king
ever need you...

01:59:17.411 --> 01:59:19.717
The king will
always have my sword,

01:59:19.891 --> 01:59:22.067
my loyalty, and my love.

01:59:39.563 --> 01:59:40.782
[horse whinnies]

01:59:41.957 --> 01:59:42.958
[Héra] What are you doing here?

01:59:43.132 --> 01:59:45.178
What does it look like?

01:59:45.352 --> 01:59:47.223
You're no longer bound
to my service.

01:59:48.442 --> 01:59:50.139
[Inhales deeply] I know.

01:59:50.966 --> 01:59:51.967
[clears throat]

01:59:53.229 --> 01:59:55.840
So, where are we going?

01:59:59.844 --> 02:00:02.847
[sobs softly]

02:00:03.021 --> 02:00:06.024
We ride for the Fords of Isen
to meet a wizard.

02:00:06.199 --> 02:00:08.462
He has questions
about the Orcs I encountered

02:00:08.636 --> 02:00:09.898
and the rings
they were stealing.

02:00:12.335 --> 02:00:15.686
Oh, aye? And does this
wizard have a name?

02:00:17.993 --> 02:00:18.994
He has many.

02:00:20.952 --> 02:00:22.867
[suspenseful music playing]

02:00:32.834 --> 02:00:36.751
But in the common tongue,
he's simply known as Gandalf.

02:00:43.801 --> 02:00:45.847
[enthralling music playing]

02:00:52.157 --> 02:00:55.944
[EÉowyn] <i>Her name was Héra,
the only daughter of Helm .</i>

02:01:00.688 --> 02:01:04.518
<i>"Wild," some called her.
"Headstrong and free."</i>

02:01:08.391 --> 02:01:11.742
<i>And so she remained,
to the end of her days.</i>

02:01:11.916 --> 02:01:13.657
[sweeping music playing]

02:01:36.854 --> 02:01:38.813
[ethereal music playing]
