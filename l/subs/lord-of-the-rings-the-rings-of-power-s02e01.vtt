00:06.083 --> 00:08.958
[Galadriel] <i>My brother
gave his life hunting Sauron.</i>

00:08.958 --> 00:10.375
<i>His task is now mine.</i>

00:11.708 --> 00:14.916
This mark's very existence
proves Sauron escaped.

00:14.916 --> 00:16.750
The question now is, where?

00:16.750 --> 00:17.833
The evil is gone.

00:17.833 --> 00:19.375
Then why is it not gone
from in here?

00:19.500 --> 00:23.333
[Gil-galad] <i>These heroes shall be
granted a passage across the sea</i>

00:23.333 --> 00:26.541
<i>to the Undying Lands of Valinor.</i>

00:30.083 --> 00:31.333
[Halbrand] <i>You're a deserter, aren't you?</i>

00:31.333 --> 00:33.625
[Galadriel] <i>Duty demanded
I return to Middle-earth.</i>

00:33.625 --> 00:35.416
Was that the mark of your people's king?

00:35.416 --> 00:36.541
My people have no king.

00:36.666 --> 00:37.916
[Galadriel] You are more than you claim.

00:37.916 --> 00:41.041
Your people have no king, for you are him.

00:41.041 --> 00:42.708
<i>Come with me to Middle-earth.</i>

00:42.708 --> 00:45.125
<i>And together we will redeem
both our bloodlines.</i>

00:45.125 --> 00:48.166
[Halbrand] <i>Be careful.
I am not the hero you seek.</i>

00:48.166 --> 00:49.750
[grunts]

00:49.750 --> 00:51.458
You remember me?

00:51.458 --> 00:52.625
No.

00:52.625 --> 00:54.125
[screaming]

00:54.125 --> 00:58.250
After Morgoth's defeat, I killed Sauron.

00:58.250 --> 00:59.250
I do not believe you.

01:00.791 --> 01:02.416
[Nori] <i>I feel like he's my responsibility.</i>

01:02.416 --> 01:04.333
- [Adar] <i>You feel like everyone is.</i>
- [Nori] <i>No.</i>

01:04.333 --> 01:06.750
<i>He could've landed anywhere,
and he landed here.</i>

01:06.875 --> 01:10.750
- This stranger isn't a Man, or an Elf...
- [screaming]

01:11.416 --> 01:12.333
He's something else.

01:12.333 --> 01:14.333
[in Quenya] <i>Á kuita!</i>

01:14.333 --> 01:16.583
- [in English] Get back!
- [Dilly yelps]

01:17.916 --> 01:19.166
[Nori] <i>This is how we help him.</i>

01:20.625 --> 01:23.250
He wants us to help him find those stars.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.666
- Where are you goin'?
- To help my friend.

01:27.666 --> 01:31.458
[Poppy] <i>You're my best friend
in this whole wide, wild world.</i>

01:31.458 --> 01:33.041
[Nori] <i>Do you remember
anything more yet?</i>

01:33.041 --> 01:37.791
More has come. But to discover the rest,
I know I must go to Rhûn.

01:38.666 --> 01:40.666
[Nori] <i>Sounds a bit like an adventure.</i>

01:42.625 --> 01:45.875
[Gil-galad] <i>The light
of the Eldar is fading.</i>

01:45.875 --> 01:49.958
Despite our every effort,
our decline has only quickened.

01:49.958 --> 01:53.958
If the Elves abandon Middle-earth,
it will be the end,

01:53.958 --> 01:57.541
<i>not just of our people, but all peoples.</i>

01:57.541 --> 02:00.708
[dramatic music playing]

02:00.708 --> 02:04.916
[Celebrimbor] <i>We are on the cusp
of crafting a new kind of power.</i>

02:04.916 --> 02:07.166
Not of the flesh, but over flesh.

02:07.166 --> 02:09.416
[Galadriel] <i>All of a sudden,
the two of you seem quite familiar.</i>

02:09.416 --> 02:11.916
[Halbrand] <i>I'm just offering
whatever humble aid I can.</i>

02:11.916 --> 02:13.166
[thuds]

02:13.166 --> 02:15.083
[Galadriel] <i>There is no King
of the Southlands.</i>

02:15.083 --> 02:16.250
<i>The line was broken.</i>

02:16.250 --> 02:17.708
Tell me your name.

02:17.708 --> 02:19.666
[Halbrand] <i>I have had many names.</i>

02:20.666 --> 02:24.083
[voice distorting, echoing]
Sauron lives because of you!

02:25.708 --> 02:26.708
[metal clinking]

02:34.250 --> 02:36.541
Galadriel, where is Halbrand?

02:36.541 --> 02:39.125
He is gone. And I doubt he will return.

02:40.125 --> 02:42.708
And should he ever,
none of us are to treat with him again.

02:42.708 --> 02:44.708
What happened by that stream?

02:46.125 --> 02:47.583
[dramatic music playing]

03:18.666 --> 03:21.666
[thunder rumbling]

03:32.708 --> 03:35.083
[ominous music playing]

03:45.875 --> 03:47.541
[Orcs snarling]

03:52.583 --> 03:54.958
[Sauron] Always, after a defeat...

03:56.958 --> 04:00.625
the shadow takes another shape
and grows again.

04:03.583 --> 04:05.125
Morgoth is gone.

04:05.791 --> 04:08.833
Leaving us alone and disgraced.

04:10.083 --> 04:13.250
But today, a new age begins.

04:14.125 --> 04:15.166
Under me.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.875
Your new master.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.458
Sauron.

04:20.458 --> 04:21.500
[Orcs clamor]

04:28.708 --> 04:32.750
And with a new age, I bring a new vision.

04:34.750 --> 04:37.583
A path to unconditional conquest.

04:37.583 --> 04:40.333
For I seek a new kind of power.

04:41.791 --> 04:44.958
Not of the flesh, but over flesh.

04:47.041 --> 04:49.125
A power of the unseen world.

04:49.958 --> 04:54.833
One we shall use to enslave the peoples
of Middle-earth to our very will.

04:56.458 --> 04:58.083
Many Orcs will die.

04:58.083 --> 05:00.833
[all exclaiming]

05:00.833 --> 05:06.208
But out of the chaos,
we will forge a new and perfect order.

05:06.833 --> 05:11.791
No longer will we be hunted
as the demons who broke Middle-earth,

05:11.791 --> 05:17.041
but rather worshipped
as the saviors who finally healed it.

05:17.041 --> 05:22.416
By bringing its peoples together,
to rule them all as one!

05:22.416 --> 05:24.250
[in Black Speech] Sauron lies!

05:30.166 --> 05:31.666
[in English] Doubt me at your peril.

05:34.375 --> 05:37.833
You have nowhere else to turn.
The Valar will never forgive you.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.500
Elves will never accept you.

05:40.500 --> 05:41.958
Men...

05:43.333 --> 05:47.083
Men will never look upon you
with anything but horror and disgust.

05:47.083 --> 05:49.625
- [Orcs growling]
- [Sauron] A corrupted and ignoble race,

05:49.625 --> 05:52.750
worthy only to be hunted and slaughtered.

05:55.916 --> 05:58.166
[Orcs exclaiming]

05:58.166 --> 06:01.208
[Orc choking]

06:07.208 --> 06:09.041
[growling]

06:09.041 --> 06:12.083
[grunting]

06:18.791 --> 06:20.583
[groans weakly]

06:23.458 --> 06:25.666
- [body thuds]
- [blade clangs]

06:28.708 --> 06:34.583
I am your only future,
and my path your only path!

06:36.958 --> 06:38.000
[snarling]

06:38.000 --> 06:40.500
Who among you dare say otherwise?

06:55.291 --> 06:58.958
[snarling]

07:04.416 --> 07:05.875
[in Black Speech] All Hail, Lord Sauron!

07:07.500 --> 07:09.416
The New Dark Lord.

07:12.166 --> 07:14.375
[Orcs] All hail!

07:40.666 --> 07:41.875
[sinister music playing]

07:41.875 --> 07:43.958
[gurgling]

07:45.333 --> 07:46.791
[growling]

07:52.583 --> 07:55.541
[grunting]

08:13.541 --> 08:14.791
[Orcs yelling]

08:14.791 --> 08:17.666
[both grunting]

08:40.875 --> 08:42.875
[indistinct whispering]

08:46.833 --> 08:48.666
[Adar exclaims in Black Speech]

08:51.708 --> 08:54.458
[grunting and yelping]

09:23.416 --> 09:25.666
[screaming]

09:36.541 --> 09:38.541
[thunder rumbling]

09:42.125 --> 09:44.791
[wind howling]

09:58.291 --> 10:00.416
[Orcs groaning]

10:06.500 --> 10:08.000
[breathing heavily]

10:17.916 --> 10:19.541
[ominous music playing]

10:49.166 --> 10:51.000
[in English] Hail Adar!

10:51.958 --> 10:53.333
Hail Adar!

10:54.375 --> 10:58.833
My children... you are free.

10:58.833 --> 11:02.083
[Orcs chanting] Hail Adar! Hail Adar!

11:02.083 --> 11:17.291
Hail Adar! Hail Adar! Hail Adar!

11:17.291 --> 11:19.875
[eerie music playing]

11:48.541 --> 11:50.375
[dripping]

12:22.958 --> 12:24.458
[sniffing]

12:25.583 --> 12:26.916
[munching]

12:37.916 --> 12:39.500
[squealing]

13:48.125 --> 13:50.875
[wind whistling]

14:01.458 --> 14:03.041
[inhales]

14:03.041 --> 14:04.750
[rattling]

14:23.583 --> 14:25.000
- [thumping]
- [girl screams]

14:25.000 --> 14:26.250
[horse whinnies]

14:34.333 --> 14:36.375
- [chomping]
- [bones crack, flesh squelches]

15:01.833 --> 15:04.125
[ominous music playing]

15:13.083 --> 15:14.666
[inhales deeply]

15:16.083 --> 15:17.541
[exhales]

16:11.875 --> 16:14.166
[suspenseful music playing]

16:15.083 --> 16:16.708
[crow cawing]

16:16.708 --> 16:18.208
[horse whinnies]

16:18.208 --> 16:19.916
[indistinct chatter]

16:23.875 --> 16:25.875
[Diarmid] That way lies death, friend.

16:28.375 --> 16:29.791
Then that is my path.

16:30.541 --> 16:33.166
An army of Orcs moves against Men.

16:33.166 --> 16:34.750
We were the fortunate ones.

16:34.750 --> 16:37.041
Perhaps the fortunate ones
were the first to die.

16:40.458 --> 16:42.083
I know you've suffered.

16:42.083 --> 16:43.750
I can see it in your eyes.

16:44.583 --> 16:46.666
There's another life waiting for you.

16:46.666 --> 16:48.583
You just have to turn toward it.

16:51.166 --> 16:52.541
That heraldry.

16:54.166 --> 16:55.625
What is it?

16:55.625 --> 16:58.375
[Diarmid] A symbol of kings, long-dead.

16:59.583 --> 17:00.833
- Your family?
- [Diarmid] No.

17:02.375 --> 17:03.708
My family served them.

17:04.625 --> 17:06.000
Then why wear it?

17:06.125 --> 17:09.000
As a reminder that our fates
are never certain,

17:09.125 --> 17:12.250
that fortunes can turn,
for even the most powerful.

17:15.500 --> 17:16.500
A grim reminder.

17:17.333 --> 17:18.833
Or a hopeful one.

17:18.833 --> 17:21.666
A sure path may crumble,

17:23.208 --> 17:24.583
but there's always another.

17:25.375 --> 17:28.458
Often, it can lead us someplace better.

17:30.708 --> 17:32.208
Someplace good.

17:35.458 --> 17:40.208
They say there's places across the sea,
a man can escape himself.

17:40.958 --> 17:42.250
Find another path.

17:42.958 --> 17:44.583
Perhaps another life.

17:44.583 --> 17:46.208
Come with us, if you like.

17:47.541 --> 17:49.875
Or, walk on.

17:51.375 --> 17:52.875
And keep chasing death.

17:58.833 --> 18:00.333
Choice is yours, friend.

18:19.375 --> 18:21.625
[wood creaking]

18:22.666 --> 18:24.125
[breathing heavily]

18:30.750 --> 18:31.916
[bell tolling]

18:39.291 --> 18:40.625
[growling]

18:53.375 --> 18:55.541
- [man] Are you all right?
- [woman] No.

18:55.541 --> 18:57.083
Nightmares again?

18:58.541 --> 19:00.083
What haunts you so?

19:04.041 --> 19:05.250
I've done evil.

19:07.500 --> 19:11.500
All of us have done things
that we care not to admit.

19:15.291 --> 19:16.708
Not like I have.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.416
Find forgiveness.

19:20.416 --> 19:24.291
You are alive
because you have chosen good.

19:24.916 --> 19:26.541
But what of tomorrow?

19:26.541 --> 19:28.791
You have to choose it again. [chuckles]

19:30.041 --> 19:33.041
And the next day. And the next.

19:33.875 --> 19:36.708
Until it becomes a part of your nature.

19:37.541 --> 19:38.791
[rumbling]

19:38.791 --> 19:41.750
[low wailing]

19:43.291 --> 19:44.833
[indistinct chatter]

19:49.083 --> 19:50.750
- Grab hold of something.
- Ah!

19:50.750 --> 19:53.458
- [passengers screaming]
- [Diarmid] Help! Help me!

19:53.458 --> 19:55.416
[dramatic music playing]

20:03.958 --> 20:05.083
Help me!

20:20.250 --> 20:21.500
[roars]

20:27.583 --> 20:31.166
[growling]

20:56.541 --> 20:58.416
[wails, screeches]

21:12.666 --> 21:14.041
[gasps]

21:16.500 --> 21:18.833
[panting]

21:28.833 --> 21:29.833
[Galadriel] Over here!

21:32.666 --> 21:34.291
[dramatic music playing]

21:39.541 --> 21:41.083
[Galadriel breathing heavily]

21:44.458 --> 21:45.791
[gasps]

21:47.791 --> 21:50.583
- [grunts]
- The tides of fate are flowing.

21:51.500 --> 21:54.791
Yours may be heading in, or out.

22:01.750 --> 22:03.833
[theme music playing]

22:12.458 --> 22:14.625
[intense music playing]

22:24.250 --> 22:25.583
- [horse whinnies]
- [Elrond grunts]

22:27.750 --> 22:28.791
[Galadriel grunts]

22:34.875 --> 22:36.083
[birds chirping]

22:50.458 --> 22:53.208
Elrond, stop, give them to me!

23:08.916 --> 23:10.000
[sighs]

23:12.916 --> 23:14.250
[grunts]

23:21.875 --> 23:24.125
[Mirthless Guard] We intend no insult,
Commander Galadriel,

23:24.750 --> 23:27.500
but by order of Herald Elrond,
you are to come with us.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.875
[suspenseful music playing]

23:53.833 --> 23:54.875
[Gil-galad] Is it true?

23:59.833 --> 24:01.000
High King.

24:05.250 --> 24:07.708
Herald Elrond carries three Rings.

24:08.875 --> 24:12.708
A means of halting the fading
and saving our people.

24:12.708 --> 24:16.416
We will discuss the Rings
once you have answered the question.

24:17.291 --> 24:21.125
Elrond just informed me your companion,
this Halbrand,

24:21.125 --> 24:22.958
was not who he claimed.

24:22.958 --> 24:26.791
Yet you chose to withhold this
from him and Celebrimbor.

24:27.291 --> 24:29.125
Is it true?

24:34.750 --> 24:35.750
Yes.

24:37.666 --> 24:39.208
Who is he?

24:40.083 --> 24:41.458
He is not what I thought.

24:42.333 --> 24:44.500
Which is the reason I did what I did.

24:44.500 --> 24:47.666
Why do you dance so
to avoid revealing the truth?

24:49.416 --> 24:50.750
[in Sindarin] High King

24:53.125 --> 24:56.416
You must believe I would never
knowingly endanger our kind.

24:57.083 --> 24:58.333
[in English] I will believe you

24:58.333 --> 25:01.958
when I no longer see the lie
behind your eyes.

25:03.041 --> 25:05.875
Now, who is this Man?

25:09.458 --> 25:10.958
He is no Man.

25:13.166 --> 25:17.166
He has been... masquerading as one.

25:19.458 --> 25:24.458
Appearing in fair form,
to hide his true self.

25:29.750 --> 25:31.041
He is Sauron.

25:32.333 --> 25:34.375
[ominous music playing]

25:36.250 --> 25:38.166
[exclaims in Sindarin]

25:44.208 --> 25:45.291
[in English] How could you?

25:48.000 --> 25:49.333
Of all our kind.

25:49.333 --> 25:52.125
He deceived me. I was deceived!

25:52.125 --> 25:56.416
No, Galadriel, you were blind.
Blinded by your own pride.

25:56.416 --> 25:58.083
And what frailty blinded you, Elrond?

25:58.083 --> 25:59.000
[in Sindarin] Silence!

25:59.000 --> 26:00.500
[in English]
What other path did your failure

26:00.500 --> 26:01.750
in Khazad-dûm leave us with?

26:01.750 --> 26:02.666
You were my friend.

26:02.666 --> 26:04.125
[in Sindarin] Silence!

26:07.375 --> 26:10.458
[in English] The Rings. Show them to me.

26:10.458 --> 26:12.500
Dare not, High King.
He's no doubt corrupted--

26:12.500 --> 26:13.958
He never touched them, High King.

26:13.958 --> 26:17.333
He worked with Celebrimbor for weeks.
We know not the depth of his influence.

26:17.333 --> 26:20.208
Soon, the last Gold-leaf will fall,

26:20.208 --> 26:24.583
and it will be my task to inform
all Lindon our time here is ended,

26:24.583 --> 26:28.291
and the Elves
must abandon these shores forever.

26:28.291 --> 26:32.000
Now, you inform me
our most cunning enemy is rising again.

26:32.708 --> 26:35.541
If we leave now,
the peoples of Middle-earth

26:35.541 --> 26:39.333
will be left to suffer
under the tyranny of a new Dark Lord.

26:40.000 --> 26:43.375
Those Rings are more than our last hope,

26:43.375 --> 26:45.958
they may be the last hope
for all Middle-earth.

26:45.958 --> 26:49.083
It is a risk we must chance to take.

26:49.708 --> 26:51.416
Give them to me.

26:54.083 --> 26:55.000
High King...

26:55.958 --> 26:58.708
Sauron has not yet amassed
that degree of power.

26:58.708 --> 27:01.250
These Rings may be how he attains it.

27:01.250 --> 27:03.208
They must be destroyed.

27:03.208 --> 27:07.375
That decision is far above your privilege,

27:07.375 --> 27:11.041
one you endanger
with each moment you refuse to obey.

27:12.333 --> 27:14.333
The Rings, Elrond.

27:16.833 --> 27:19.541
It is a command from your King.

27:19.541 --> 27:21.375
I will not utter it again.

27:21.375 --> 27:23.166
[Galadriel, in Sindarin] Obey him.

27:23.166 --> 27:24.416
[in Sindarin] You would say that to me?

27:24.416 --> 27:26.833
It is the only way. Obey him!

27:43.375 --> 27:44.708
[Elrond] I cannot.

27:50.291 --> 27:51.750
You know I cannot.

27:52.958 --> 27:53.958
Seize him!

27:56.291 --> 27:57.583
[Galadriel, in English] Elrond, no!

27:57.583 --> 27:59.916
[dramatic music playing]

28:05.458 --> 28:08.166
[in Sindarin] Find him. Find the rings.

28:08.166 --> 28:09.458
Go!

28:13.833 --> 28:15.708
[sinister music playing]

28:29.500 --> 28:31.375
[Orcs shouting]

28:31.375 --> 28:32.958
Keep up! Move!

28:43.333 --> 28:45.291
Move those legs, king.

28:55.375 --> 28:56.875
[Orc] Well, take that.

28:56.875 --> 28:59.250
[Waldreg] Welcome to Mordor.

28:59.250 --> 29:02.125
Work its land well,
and you'll be fed well.

29:02.125 --> 29:05.416
Work it badly, and you'll feed the soil.

29:07.625 --> 29:13.291
You, lad, do you swear allegiance to Adar,
Lord-father of the <i>Uruks?</i>

29:16.458 --> 29:17.583
- [yelps]
- [Orcs grunts]

29:17.583 --> 29:20.083
[straining]

29:20.083 --> 29:22.833
It is the Southlands no more!

29:22.833 --> 29:26.916
In Mordor, ya bow or ya bleed.

29:26.916 --> 29:31.000
Right, you there.
Do you swear allegiance to Adar?

29:32.416 --> 29:33.458
[whimpers]

29:39.583 --> 29:42.458
[screaming]

29:47.166 --> 29:48.583
[Waldreg] I'll take this one!

29:53.833 --> 29:57.791
[Glüg] The King of the Southlands
turned himself in, Lord-father.

29:57.791 --> 30:00.208
Says he wants to negotiate.

30:06.583 --> 30:08.291
Let my people go.

30:09.708 --> 30:12.000
[all laughing]

30:12.625 --> 30:13.916
Or yours will die.

30:17.416 --> 30:19.916
My people defeated the Men of these lands.

30:21.291 --> 30:23.916
We defeated the Elves
who came to their aid.

30:23.916 --> 30:28.458
We even defeated their allies,
the Men from beyond the sea.

30:35.166 --> 30:37.375
There is no one left for us to fear.

30:39.125 --> 30:40.208
There is one.

30:41.666 --> 30:46.750
Since Galadriel's defeat,
she sought out a new ally.

30:47.333 --> 30:52.166
An ancient sorcerer, to instruct the Elves
in forging a new weapon.

30:54.875 --> 30:56.666
One you first told her about.

30:57.916 --> 30:59.750
A power over flesh.

31:01.791 --> 31:03.375
Do you remember those words?

31:04.041 --> 31:07.083
A power that will allow him
to use your children

31:07.083 --> 31:09.416
as slaves in his army once more.

31:10.500 --> 31:13.541
Set my people free, and I will tell you
where he can be found.

31:14.750 --> 31:19.208
So you can destroy him,
and rid us both of his evil.

31:20.958 --> 31:24.083
No, Your Majesty.

31:25.625 --> 31:29.583
You will tell me everything
you think you know of this sorcerer now.

31:31.375 --> 31:33.625
Or I will spill the words
from your throat.

31:35.000 --> 31:39.208
If I die, all that I know dies with me.

31:41.958 --> 31:43.375
You can't kill me.

31:45.541 --> 31:48.541
In time, you will beg me to.

31:50.750 --> 31:51.750
Ah!

31:53.666 --> 31:54.833
[groans]

31:54.833 --> 31:56.166
[sighs]

31:56.166 --> 31:57.625
Your Majesty.

31:58.416 --> 31:59.541
- Ha!
- [groans softly]

31:59.541 --> 32:01.833
[Glüg] What he said, Lord-father...

32:01.833 --> 32:06.500
Sauron... could never return, could he?

32:06.500 --> 32:07.583
No.

32:08.416 --> 32:10.083
Sauron is dead.

32:10.083 --> 32:11.583
[Waldreg] On your knees, you maggots!

32:18.375 --> 32:20.291
[suspenseful music playing]

32:38.083 --> 32:40.166
[panting]

33:02.500 --> 33:04.625
[indistinct whispering]

33:22.041 --> 33:24.916
[insects trilling]

33:30.375 --> 33:31.916
You got that look in your eye.

33:37.583 --> 33:40.625
You had that dream again last night,
didn't you?

33:41.833 --> 33:45.541
If you tell me what it is you keep seein',
maybe I could...

33:46.666 --> 33:48.375
help you puzzle it out.

33:48.375 --> 33:51.583
Maybe it's a clue
to what we're going to find...

33:52.458 --> 33:54.333
when we reach those stars.

33:57.291 --> 33:59.250
It's the heat. That's all.

34:01.333 --> 34:03.958
[man breathing heavily]

34:21.708 --> 34:24.125
No. It can't be.

34:25.833 --> 34:27.166
Stone trees.

34:29.250 --> 34:30.666
We're goin' in circles.

34:30.666 --> 34:35.500
There must be some evil upon this land,
confusing our path.

34:35.500 --> 34:37.500
Just admit it. We're lost.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.708
Panic is the fool's meal, Nori.

34:39.708 --> 34:42.125
We would be wiser to sup on patience.

34:42.125 --> 34:44.875
We haven't supped on anything
since we ran out of snails.

34:44.875 --> 34:46.583
There's nothin' to eat out here.

34:48.833 --> 34:52.250
[Stranger panting]

34:56.250 --> 34:59.000
[playful music playing]

35:07.500 --> 35:09.333
Oh, no. Oh, no.

35:10.083 --> 35:11.000
Oh, come on.

35:11.541 --> 35:14.750
It might bear some fruit.
Least you could do is try.

35:14.750 --> 35:17.458
Have you forgotten what happened
when last I tried such a thing?

35:23.708 --> 35:24.708
Further.

35:33.791 --> 35:35.166
Further, Nori.

35:41.291 --> 35:42.166
[sighs]

35:43.250 --> 35:44.333
All right?

35:49.416 --> 35:52.041
[rumbling]

35:55.041 --> 35:55.875
[exhales softly]

36:07.750 --> 36:09.458
[speaking Quenya]

36:19.000 --> 36:21.750
[tree creaking]

36:24.916 --> 36:27.250
Ah! [grunts]

36:30.625 --> 36:31.875
[gasps]

36:35.333 --> 36:37.208
[groaning]

36:37.208 --> 36:40.375
You did it. We'll eat for days.

36:41.708 --> 36:43.708
[laughing]

36:46.583 --> 36:48.666
[insects trilling]

36:58.541 --> 36:59.541
[Nori] Don't be so glum.

36:59.541 --> 37:02.458
I asked you to conjure us up some food,
and you did.

37:03.125 --> 37:04.416
Nobody got hurt.

37:04.416 --> 37:05.708
I lost control.

37:06.583 --> 37:09.041
So you need to learn
how not to lose control.

37:11.625 --> 37:16.416
In the dream, there's a kind of... branch.

37:17.750 --> 37:19.041
Under the stars.

37:19.750 --> 37:21.583
When I reach out to grasp it...

37:27.708 --> 37:30.708
What is it? What happens next?

37:33.625 --> 37:36.458
Some things are best not shared aloud.

37:38.208 --> 37:42.208
Except, well, you did sort of
share it aloud.

37:42.208 --> 37:45.000
So it's not rightly fair
to be all cryptic about it now, is it?

37:45.000 --> 37:49.458
But perhaps, wizards are not always fair.

37:54.041 --> 37:55.625
- [Nori chuckles]
- Hmm.

37:58.458 --> 37:59.583
Mmm.

38:00.250 --> 38:01.083
[laughs]

38:01.083 --> 38:03.791
- I can feel the legs in the throat.
- That's the best part.

38:03.791 --> 38:04.916
They're dancin'.

38:05.708 --> 38:08.875
Poppy and I,
we used sing little buggy songs

38:08.875 --> 38:11.166
so they'd have music
to dance to when they...

38:16.291 --> 38:17.500
Well.

38:18.958 --> 38:21.666
It is quite all right
for a Harfoot to miss home.

38:23.083 --> 38:24.958
I knew it'd be hard. It's just, um...

38:28.416 --> 38:29.625
Well.

38:31.750 --> 38:33.250
This hard's different.

38:34.500 --> 38:39.541
Strange how that which is left behind
can be the heaviest burden to carry.

38:43.166 --> 38:44.750
I miss my home, as well.

38:46.666 --> 38:48.291
You don't even remember yours.

38:48.791 --> 38:49.791
No.

38:53.250 --> 38:56.250
Sometimes,
I perceive a glimmer of it nonetheless.

38:56.875 --> 39:01.041
A longing for a feeling
I can't remember or even name.

39:04.500 --> 39:05.750
But I know it's real.

39:08.375 --> 39:10.083
Just beyond the sunset.

39:30.250 --> 39:31.875
It appears we're being followed.

39:31.875 --> 39:33.416
[music playing]

39:41.500 --> 39:45.625
[growling]

40:08.375 --> 40:10.791
[growls, snarls]

40:21.000 --> 40:22.791
Come on, Your Majesty.

40:24.041 --> 40:27.625
Not even kings can go without food.

40:29.333 --> 40:30.750
Why don't you open up?

40:32.666 --> 40:37.583
You tell old Waldreg
everything you know about Sauron.

40:40.916 --> 40:42.000
[exclaims]

40:44.750 --> 40:48.291
Pain must be something you enjoy.

40:53.708 --> 40:55.291
[grunts]

40:56.750 --> 41:00.208
After Lord-father releases me,
I'm going to kill you.

41:00.708 --> 41:03.541
Adar doesn't even remember you're here.

41:06.291 --> 41:08.625
[Halbrand grunts]

41:21.541 --> 41:22.750
[gasps]

41:22.750 --> 41:24.250
[breathing heavily]

41:37.875 --> 41:40.958
[creature growling]

42:01.791 --> 42:03.041
[intense music playing]

42:08.041 --> 42:09.416
[speaking Black Speech]

42:36.125 --> 42:37.375
[horse whinnies]

42:40.041 --> 42:41.500
[indistinct shouting]

43:05.208 --> 43:06.583
[indistinct chatter]

43:25.916 --> 43:26.916
Perfection.

43:27.416 --> 43:30.666
Perfection exists only in Valinor.

43:30.666 --> 43:32.250
Thank you, Master Círdan.

44:17.125 --> 44:18.875
You needn't hide any longer.

44:26.666 --> 44:28.083
Master Círdan.

44:36.458 --> 44:39.041
Please forgive the unexpected nature
of my visit,

44:40.416 --> 44:42.166
but I have nowhere else to turn.

44:42.166 --> 44:45.125
You are the oldest and wisest of our kind.

44:45.875 --> 44:48.583
And the Elves are facing
our greatest test in an age.

44:50.625 --> 44:53.250
I perceive you carry something
in your charge.

44:53.250 --> 44:56.166
Something louder than the sea.

44:57.041 --> 44:58.250
What have you brought here?

44:58.250 --> 45:00.000
[rings clink]

45:04.500 --> 45:07.583
It is to be given directly
to Lord Celebrimbor.

45:07.583 --> 45:09.375
He must be informed

45:09.375 --> 45:12.000
that Halbrand is Sauron.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.750
Move with haste,

45:14.333 --> 45:16.791
and trust no stranger upon your path.

45:17.416 --> 45:18.666
Yes, my lord.

45:30.791 --> 45:31.875
[door closes]

45:31.875 --> 45:35.166
I have yet to thank you.
For trusting me, regarding the Rings.

45:35.166 --> 45:36.666
Trusting you?

45:38.291 --> 45:39.791
Let us be clear, Commander.

45:40.625 --> 45:43.875
You and I are momentarily aligned
for one reason,

45:44.375 --> 45:47.250
because your actions
have left us no alternative.

45:47.958 --> 45:51.375
Because of you, our enemy lives.

45:52.291 --> 45:55.291
Because of you, we've no choice
but to test the virtue of the Rings.

45:55.291 --> 45:56.875
I should have you thrown in fetters

45:56.875 --> 45:58.708
and cast to the Ettenmoors
for what you've done.

45:58.708 --> 46:00.416
Then why have you not?

46:03.708 --> 46:05.333
I am considering it.

46:14.916 --> 46:16.666
I swear to you, High King,

46:18.208 --> 46:22.541
I will not stop until he is destroyed
and I have put this right.

46:25.541 --> 46:28.125
You would not be here now
if I thought otherwise.

46:33.250 --> 46:35.625
[female guard] High King,
we have not found the Rings.

46:36.625 --> 46:39.208
We've scoured everywhere water meets rock,
and yet,

46:40.000 --> 46:41.375
there's no trace of him.

46:42.291 --> 46:44.125
- Perhaps the fall--
- No.

46:45.166 --> 46:46.416
Elrond lives.

46:48.041 --> 46:49.666
Expand the search.

46:50.166 --> 46:53.833
Set a watch at every crossing.
He must not escape.

46:58.583 --> 47:00.458
Escape is not his plan.

47:02.250 --> 47:03.458
Meaning?

47:04.583 --> 47:06.875
He spoke of destroying the Rings.

47:07.500 --> 47:09.833
Elrond would seek out
someone he can trust.

47:10.541 --> 47:13.208
Someone older, wiser...

47:14.500 --> 47:16.500
Whose voice would command respect.

47:17.625 --> 47:19.250
Even from you.

47:19.833 --> 47:23.041
Someone who could turn the tides his way.

47:28.958 --> 47:30.458
[Elrond] You may examine them.

47:32.291 --> 47:34.208
I've seen Celebrimbor's work before.

47:35.625 --> 47:37.625
- He's remarkable.
- He is.

47:38.458 --> 47:42.458
I remember, he used to speak of, one day,
crafting objects of such power,

47:42.458 --> 47:45.166
they could change the heart
of any who beheld them.

47:47.000 --> 47:49.666
If, as you say,

47:49.666 --> 47:53.875
these Rings have so quickly
turned Elf against Elf...

47:56.583 --> 47:58.291
it would appear he has succeeded.

47:59.750 --> 48:03.041
Perhaps it was not Celebrimbor's hand
that produced that effect.

48:04.375 --> 48:06.125
If what you've told me is true,

48:07.083 --> 48:11.166
these three Rings were made
without Sauron's touch.

48:11.833 --> 48:13.250
The Enemy is cunning.

48:14.041 --> 48:16.458
The Rings may well be a ploy on his part.

48:16.458 --> 48:19.916
A device in some larger plan,
the end of which we cannot yet see.

48:25.666 --> 48:27.291
What would you ask of me?

48:28.666 --> 48:30.541
The Rings must be destroyed.

48:31.666 --> 48:34.541
Do so, and the Age of the Elves will end.

48:37.333 --> 48:41.625
We would be abandoning
all Middle-earth to its fate.

48:42.666 --> 48:43.791
Could you accept that?

48:43.791 --> 48:48.083
If to do otherwise means falling prey
to the designs of the Enemy...

48:49.375 --> 48:50.375
Yes.

48:51.583 --> 48:53.333
You do your father proud.

48:58.833 --> 49:00.791
[suspenseful music playing]

49:05.125 --> 49:06.708
Long ago, there was a battle.

49:08.416 --> 49:11.583
One whose weapons
were the very bones of the continents.

49:11.583 --> 49:14.500
Still now, at the spot
where our bay meets the sea,

49:14.500 --> 49:17.375
there remains on the seabed
a scar so deep,

49:17.375 --> 49:20.250
its end none but Manwë himself knows.

49:20.250 --> 49:25.166
If one were to cast these Rings
into its depths, they--

49:25.166 --> 49:26.500
[horse whinnies]

49:38.375 --> 49:39.916
Let me speak with him first.

49:41.166 --> 49:42.583
Please, High King.

49:44.000 --> 49:47.541
Give me one last chance
to reason with my friend?

49:48.958 --> 49:50.541
Reason quickly.

49:58.541 --> 49:59.625
Elrond?

50:01.708 --> 50:03.500
I have come to coax you willingly.

50:04.000 --> 50:07.000
If I fail, the High King
will see you removed by force.

50:12.125 --> 50:14.083
I have failed enough of late, old friend.

50:15.583 --> 50:17.250
Help me succeed this time?

50:20.583 --> 50:25.000
I should have trusted you,
as I asked you to trust me.

50:26.666 --> 50:30.500
But unless we both trust in the Rings now,
all will be lost.

50:33.000 --> 50:34.625
With three, there is balance.

50:35.958 --> 50:36.958
Don't you remember?

50:37.708 --> 50:39.500
We chose this path together.

50:41.500 --> 50:44.208
- No, you chose it for me.
- Elrond--

50:44.208 --> 50:46.125
What so frightens you, you cannot consider

50:46.125 --> 50:47.708
the possibility of their corruption?

50:50.083 --> 50:51.583
Because in my heart,

50:52.833 --> 50:55.666
I know The Three Rings
are free of his influence.

50:56.458 --> 50:57.541
But are you?

51:00.083 --> 51:04.375
The light of Valinor shone
upon your very face, Galadriel,

51:05.041 --> 51:06.666
and you turned your back on it.

51:08.083 --> 51:12.375
Was it truly to fight the darkness
or was the darkness calling to you?

51:12.375 --> 51:15.583
Can you not see?
All this may be by his design.

51:15.583 --> 51:17.708
I did what I felt was right.

51:19.666 --> 51:23.666
And time alone will reveal
whether that was folly or wisdom.

51:26.625 --> 51:29.083
What time do you think you have?

51:31.791 --> 51:33.208
Where is Círdan?

51:33.916 --> 51:35.916
You did what you must, Galadriel.

51:38.708 --> 51:40.083
So have I.

51:40.083 --> 51:41.416
Elrond.

51:42.708 --> 51:44.541
Where are the Rings?

51:44.541 --> 51:47.666
[dramatic music playing]

52:33.166 --> 52:35.166

53:05.291 --> 53:06.291
[Poppy] Huh?

53:13.208 --> 53:14.416

53:14.416 --> 53:15.958
Poppy!

53:15.958 --> 53:17.000
[giggles]

53:18.458 --> 53:20.708
[Nori] Mmm, honey biscuits.

53:20.708 --> 53:22.708
Never been happier in my life
than right now.

53:26.916 --> 53:28.666
How's everyone at home?

53:30.291 --> 53:31.416
About the same.

53:31.416 --> 53:33.375
Your ma took to giving me your chores,

53:33.375 --> 53:35.208
but your da said I didn't have to do 'em.

53:38.916 --> 53:40.333
You came after us.

53:41.000 --> 53:44.125
Wasn't so hard.
You haven't exactly gotten very far.

53:44.125 --> 53:45.583
Yes, well, we appear to be lost.

53:45.583 --> 53:47.000
So now you admit it.

53:47.000 --> 53:49.166
Well, you won't be for long. Look.

53:51.208 --> 53:52.916
I was sifting through Sadoc's old book.

53:52.916 --> 53:55.500
Harfoots must've journeyed this way
a long time ago.

53:55.500 --> 53:57.208
See, there's a warnin',

53:57.208 --> 54:00.750
"Not to forget the words to the song,
or you'll just go round in circles."

54:00.750 --> 54:02.791
Song? What song?

54:02.791 --> 54:03.916
Give you one guess.

54:03.916 --> 54:08.125
<i>Sing to me, sing to me, land far away</i>

54:09.458 --> 54:11.875
- The walkin' song?
- I think it's some kinda directions.

54:11.875 --> 54:13.583
Our folk have been wanderin' for years.

54:13.583 --> 54:15.791
Guess this path
must have been important to them.

54:15.791 --> 54:17.625
I say, we climb.

54:18.500 --> 54:23.666
"Trees of stone... Light in the tower,
no longer my home."

54:30.125 --> 54:31.125
There.

54:36.375 --> 54:38.208
"Past eyes of pale fire."

54:40.916 --> 54:42.666
"Black sand for my bed."

54:45.916 --> 54:49.291
"I trade all I've known
for the unknown ahead."

55:07.125 --> 55:09.541
Welcome to the lands of Rhûn.

55:10.708 --> 55:13.125
Come on. What are you waitin' for?

55:14.125 --> 55:15.625
This is only the beginnin'.

55:23.041 --> 55:24.708
Why you looking at it like that?

55:26.833 --> 55:28.000
Like what?

55:28.583 --> 55:30.458
Like you've been here before.

55:33.333 --> 55:34.750
Only in dreams.

[music stops]

57:13.083 --> 57:14.208
[scoffs]

57:14.916 --> 57:16.416
I was in your place once.

57:20.958 --> 57:22.958
In the eldest of the Elder Days.

57:27.666 --> 57:32.125
Thirteen of us were chosen
to be blessed of Morgoth's hand,

57:32.125 --> 57:34.041
with the promise of power.

57:36.000 --> 57:37.416
A new birth.

57:41.708 --> 57:45.166
I was led up to a dark and nameless peak.

57:45.166 --> 57:47.541
Chained and left.

57:49.208 --> 57:53.916
And after what seemed
endless thirst and hunger...

57:56.958 --> 57:58.166
I saw it.

58:01.333 --> 58:02.875
His servant's face.

58:05.375 --> 58:07.083
Sauron's face.

58:09.291 --> 58:11.708
And it was beautiful.

58:14.166 --> 58:17.375
He offered me wine, red as a blood moon.

58:20.666 --> 58:24.208
He offered me wine,
and on that dark and nameless peak,

58:26.125 --> 58:27.166
I drank it.

58:27.583 --> 58:28.958
I drank it all.

58:33.791 --> 58:35.708
Your people have been set free.

58:38.791 --> 58:41.000
Now, tell me what you know of Sauron.

58:46.375 --> 58:48.875
Sauron has returned in a new form.

58:50.625 --> 58:54.083
I am not yet certain
what shape he has taken.

58:54.083 --> 58:55.833
Then of what use are you to me?

58:56.750 --> 58:58.833
I have something you don't.

58:58.833 --> 59:00.416
The trust of the Elves.

59:01.416 --> 59:02.875
Release me,

59:04.541 --> 59:06.458
and I'll go to them and seek him out,

59:07.041 --> 59:09.750
so you can marshal your legions
to destroy him.

59:12.541 --> 59:14.666
[breath trembling]

59:26.625 --> 59:30.208
Do you vow allegiance to Adar,

59:30.875 --> 59:33.125
Lord-father of the <i>Uruks?</i>

59:40.750 --> 59:42.125
Yes.

59:44.791 --> 59:46.250
Then kneel.

01:00:02.625 --> 01:00:04.000
Now, swear it.

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:10.333
- I vow--
- With your head at my feet.

01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.458
I vow to serve the Lord of Mordor.

01:00:31.875 --> 01:00:33.541
To the end of my days...

01:00:35.875 --> 01:00:36.916
and his.

01:00:52.625 --> 01:00:54.750
[Waldreg] What're you doing? Keep away.

01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.666
See that he's followed. Every step.

01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:04.833
"I'm going to kill you."

01:01:06.375 --> 01:01:08.416
Is that right, Your Majesty?

01:01:09.625 --> 01:01:11.541
- All hail the king.
- [thuds]

01:01:11.541 --> 01:01:12.875

As coals too long removed from the hearth,

01:02:53.250 --> 01:02:58.708
we must return to our home
or diminish forever into endless night.

01:02:58.708 --> 01:03:01.166
And so it is come to pass,

01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:06.208

Let us pray the Rings worked,

To try and do something special.
