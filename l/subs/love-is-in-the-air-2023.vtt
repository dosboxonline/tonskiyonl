[dog barking in distance]

00:29.696 --> 00:32.282
-[dog whimpering]
-[Michelle] Doug.

00:40.457 --> 00:43.960
Foxtrot November Bravo,
this is Lofton Homestead. Please come in.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.973
Fullerton Airways,
this is Foxtrot November Bravo.

00:57.056 --> 00:59.642
Mail drop complete. Heading back to base.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.895
[Jeff on radio] Roger that.
Get a wiggle on.

01:01.978 --> 01:04.689
Your next tour group's
already been waiting 20 minutes.

01:04.773 --> 01:06.649
Yeah, copy that. I'm on my way.

01:06.733 --> 01:08.276
[distorted voice on radio]

01:09.319 --> 01:12.489
[Michelle] …Bravo, this is Lofton
Homestead. Please come in.

01:12.572 --> 01:15.950
Lofton Homestead, I'm reading you
loud and clear. What's wrong?

01:16.034 --> 01:18.328
Doug's been bitten by a snake,
and he's fading.

01:18.411 --> 01:21.623
We need to see Dr. Justman ASAP.
Can you help us out?

01:21.706 --> 01:23.833
No worries, Michelle, I'll be there in 20.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.127
-You just get him ready to go.
-We'll see you soon. Out.

01:26.211 --> 01:29.047
-[Dana] Fullerton Airways, do you read?
-[Jeff] Go ahead.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.173
[Dana] Call Dr. Justman.

01:30.256 --> 01:32.133
-I'm bringing Doug to see him.
-[Jeff] What?

01:32.217 --> 01:34.636
We have paying clients
twiddling their thumbs here.

01:34.719 --> 01:37.013
[Dana] It's an emergency. Snakebite.

01:37.096 --> 01:40.225
[Jeff] Snakebite…
Do you even have enough fuel to get there?

01:42.811 --> 01:43.770
I'll make it.

01:55.615 --> 01:57.200
[engine decelerating]

02:12.423 --> 02:14.717
[sighs] Hi, Dana.
Thank God you were around.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.010
Strap in.

02:16.094 --> 02:17.762
[engine starts]

02:40.368 --> 02:43.288
[Jeff] Eh, what am I gonna do
with that girl?

02:54.883 --> 02:56.885
[Dana] Valve sounded good up there, Nik.

02:56.968 --> 03:00.138
Yeah, you better hope it does.
Cost enough. Bloody rip off.

03:00.221 --> 03:02.682
[Jeff] What would you do
if you didn't have our customers

03:02.765 --> 03:05.602
-to pinch, ey, Mike?
-[Mike] Keep 'em coming, Jeff.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.395
You trying to send me to an early grave?

03:07.478 --> 03:10.481
You look pretty good to me.
Have you been exercising?

03:10.565 --> 03:12.942
Yeah, well, actually…
Stop changing the subject.

03:14.235 --> 03:17.488
You've got to stop putting
remote air support over paying clients.

03:17.572 --> 03:19.866
[Nikki] Wait, did we just lose
another flight?

03:19.949 --> 03:23.328
-[Dana] I had to help. It's Doug.
-We're stretched thin here.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.163
We've been stretched thin before.

03:25.246 --> 03:28.917
Not this thin.
Price of parts is always rising.

03:29.000 --> 03:33.630
Every time we make a mail delivery
or supply food or medicine

03:33.713 --> 03:37.258
or fly Doug to Dr. Justman,

03:37.342 --> 03:41.846
that's a potential paying tourist flight
that doesn't happen.

03:42.555 --> 03:45.266
Kills me to say it,
but if we're gonna stay in the air,

03:45.350 --> 03:48.144
we're gonna have to focus on profit.

03:48.228 --> 03:52.357
Dad, remote air support is the reason
Mom started Fullerton Airways.

03:52.440 --> 03:53.691
That was the whole point.

03:53.775 --> 03:55.360
[hesitates] I know, Dana, but--

03:55.443 --> 03:58.571
Things will pick up.
We just got to book more charter to it,

03:58.655 --> 04:00.698
so I'll start running night flights.

04:00.782 --> 04:03.243
[Jeff] You can't stay
in the air 24/7, Dana.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.161
You've gotta take some time for yourself.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.747
-Don't make me say it.
-Dana, I'm serious.

04:07.830 --> 04:09.832
-Like Mom always said…
-Sweety.

04:09.916 --> 04:13.378
…"If you want something done,
you've got to do it yourself."

04:13.461 --> 04:15.380
-Let me hear it.
-Do it yourself.

04:15.463 --> 04:16.506
Do it yourself.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.801
If you need me,
I'll be doing ground checks.

04:21.177 --> 04:22.595
[exhales]

04:27.392 --> 04:28.393
[sighs wearily]

04:28.476 --> 04:30.311
[Jeff] She's a lot like you, Clara.

04:58.423 --> 04:59.882
[William] Fullerton Airways.

05:00.591 --> 05:04.053
Their margin has been cratering
year on year.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.638
They're not doing well.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.891
No. Nobody says that.
"They're not doing well."

05:08.975 --> 05:12.895
It's unprofessional.
They are… They are…

05:14.605 --> 05:16.024
bleeding from the throat.

05:16.899 --> 05:20.278
They're bleeding from the throat.
That's good. That sounds tough.

05:20.361 --> 05:21.696
Yeah.

05:22.530 --> 05:23.448
You got this.

05:34.667 --> 05:37.420
-[William exhales]
-We're going around in circles.

05:37.503 --> 05:41.215
Go and tell them to get back to me
with a tender offer by noon tomorrow.

05:41.299 --> 05:43.885
And you tell them
that I expect their commitment.

05:43.968 --> 05:47.263
Come in. Oh, Alex, spare me.
I love the deal at 40.

05:47.346 --> 05:50.308
It's an insult at 50. [mouthing]

05:53.352 --> 05:54.353
Good.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.857
Now I have to go. My son's here.

05:58.608 --> 05:59.484
Okay.

05:59.984 --> 06:02.195
-[line disconnects]
-William.

06:02.278 --> 06:03.696
Hello, Dad. Good to see you.

06:03.780 --> 06:06.032
The board will be convening shortly,

06:06.115 --> 06:08.326
-so I only have a few minutes.
-Yeah.

06:08.409 --> 06:13.081
So, your team leader tells me
you're doing good work.

06:13.164 --> 06:18.795
As I recall, you were always stronger
on your humanities than your maths.

06:19.879 --> 06:22.548
I hope she's not just telling me
what I want to hear.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.344
I knew it was a good idea
to start bribing her.

06:27.678 --> 06:31.224
So then, how goes your little assignment?
What have you got for me?

06:31.307 --> 06:35.061
Oh, um, well,
before we get into it, I just…

06:35.144 --> 06:36.479
I wanted to say thank you.

06:36.562 --> 06:38.564
I'm looking forward to working with you.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.109
William, I haven't got all day.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.111
Yeah, right.

06:43.903 --> 06:45.363
Right. Um…

06:46.364 --> 06:51.494
Well, your, um, e-mail said to identify
possible areas for consolidation.

06:51.577 --> 06:53.496
I did some digging. Um…

06:54.664 --> 06:59.877
Fullerton Airways, uh, their margins
have been cratering year on year.

06:59.961 --> 07:03.714
They're bleeding from the throat.
But there are salvageable assets.

07:03.798 --> 07:07.802
Um, aeronautical equipment,
planes, real estate,

07:08.427 --> 07:11.097
which, if we were to pull
the trigger and sell,

07:11.764 --> 07:13.933
would wipe
the debt holdings off our books.

07:19.730 --> 07:22.733
I must confess. I am a little surprised.

07:23.526 --> 07:24.485
Oh.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.779
This is strong work.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.699
[both chuckle]

07:29.782 --> 07:30.616
Take care of it.

07:33.453 --> 07:34.287
Um…

07:35.663 --> 07:36.914
Uh… mmm.

07:37.665 --> 07:39.125
I don't… What do you mean?

07:39.208 --> 07:41.294
Go to Fullerton and take care of it.

07:41.377 --> 07:42.670
Right. Okay.

07:43.421 --> 07:49.093
Okay, so the thing is,
is Fullerton is, um, in Australia.

07:49.177 --> 07:50.261
Yes.

07:52.722 --> 07:54.265
[softly] That's a long flight.

07:54.932 --> 07:58.436
Um, are you sure, though,
that I'm the right, you know, person?

07:58.519 --> 08:00.354
Because my temperament, I don't…

08:00.438 --> 08:03.149
-Australia's very brash.
-Nevertheless, we have to show

08:03.232 --> 08:05.359
that we've done
our due diligence before selling.

08:05.443 --> 08:07.820
Inspect the operation,
go over their books,

08:07.904 --> 08:10.490
cross the T's, dot the I's and then…
[clicks tongue]

08:11.199 --> 08:12.241
Yeah.

08:13.326 --> 08:14.410
Why me?

08:16.287 --> 08:20.041
Because… next year,
I plan to recommend you

08:20.124 --> 08:23.211
for the position of junior director.

08:26.506 --> 08:30.510
It's time. Time for you
to take on real responsibility.

08:30.593 --> 08:33.262
[chuckles] Wow.

08:34.931 --> 08:35.765
Wow.

08:36.432 --> 08:38.643
-God, thank you.
-Don't thank me yet.

08:38.726 --> 08:40.311
-Okay.
-If…

08:40.394 --> 08:44.607
If you're going to take on
an executive role in this firm,

08:44.690 --> 08:48.069
you have to demonstrate
that you can do what's necessary.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.820
-By going to…
-Australia.

08:49.904 --> 08:51.239
-Australia.
-Correct.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.199
The board meets again in just over a week.

08:53.282 --> 08:57.328
I want you to take care of it,
then present to them in person.

08:58.329 --> 08:59.247
Okay.

09:01.666 --> 09:04.085
That's good. Okay.

09:07.129 --> 09:09.215
-William.
-Yes. Yeah.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.217
This is important.

09:11.801 --> 09:12.718
Yeah.

09:13.511 --> 09:14.887
Don't disappoint me.

09:15.721 --> 09:19.058
No. Yes, sir.

09:28.150 --> 09:31.404
[Nikki] '96 BMW K1100RS.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.614
-Sick beast.
-Uh-huh.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.074
What's he asking?

09:35.825 --> 09:37.994
-Fifteen grand?
-[dart thuds]

09:38.077 --> 09:39.745
[mimics buzzer]

09:39.829 --> 09:41.455
[in sing-song voice] My turn.

09:41.539 --> 09:43.791
-That was a shocker.
-Also you suck.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.042
[both chuckle]

09:45.751 --> 09:46.586
[grunts]

09:47.878 --> 09:50.506
-[Heath] Good shot, Nik.
-Oi, what would you pay

09:50.590 --> 09:54.010
for a '96 BMW K1100RS?

09:54.093 --> 09:56.137
-How many K's on it?
-35,000.

09:56.762 --> 09:58.264
-Eight grand?
-Exactly.

09:58.347 --> 09:59.849
[Heath] You know, uh,

09:59.932 --> 10:03.436
Dana used to love hitting up Lang's field
on the back of my '97, right?

10:03.519 --> 10:07.189
[chuckles] Um, I think we remember things
a little bit differently.

10:07.273 --> 10:08.816
-Oh.
-[both chuckle]

10:08.899 --> 10:10.651
Okay. Please get back together.

10:10.735 --> 10:12.737
-Wouldn't hold your breath.
-Please ignore her.

10:12.820 --> 10:15.072
She's freakishly obsessed
with my love life.

10:15.156 --> 10:16.991
Excuse me? What love life?

10:17.074 --> 10:19.410
I just think you need
to get out more, okay?

10:19.493 --> 10:22.163
I hate to say it, D, but, um, she's right.

10:22.747 --> 10:23.748
[Nikki] I'm correct.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.376
-[scoffs]
-What's the problem anyway?

10:27.460 --> 10:30.838
-Dating is fun.
-When do I have time to go on dates?

10:30.921 --> 10:33.883
Yeah, but that's exactly kind
of the point right there.

10:33.966 --> 10:36.677
You can't dedicate
your entire life to work.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.220
Have some Dana time.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.723
And that's not a euphemism,
don't be gross.

10:40.806 --> 10:43.809
Love what you do, do what you love,
never work a day in your life.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.394
Isn't that what they say, Nikki?

10:45.478 --> 10:48.397
Yes, but you don't have
to be this nuts about it.

10:48.481 --> 10:51.817
Jeff's, right, you know, maybe it's time
we switched gears and…

10:51.901 --> 10:54.695
I don't know, leave saving the day
to the big guys.

10:54.779 --> 10:58.574
Okay. Would you guys relax?
I… I know what I'm doing.

10:59.283 --> 11:00.785
-Is that so?
-Mmm-hmm.

11:00.868 --> 11:02.745
It's Dana's way or no way, huh?

11:02.828 --> 11:04.830
No, it's not my way.

11:05.456 --> 11:08.834
I just want to keep Fullerton Airways
the way it's always been.

11:09.752 --> 11:10.961
The way Mom made it.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.840
I miss her too, you know. We all miss her.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.884
She was real special. One in a million.

11:18.302 --> 11:21.639
I guess in spite, you got to put your feet
on the ground sometime.

11:21.722 --> 11:23.724
Otherwise, life will fly right by you.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.978
-Have you been practicing that?
-Yes, in the mirror.

11:28.062 --> 11:30.481
It was a pun about flying.
It's very clever.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.735
-All right, I'm out.
-All right.

11:34.819 --> 11:37.405
But remember, life will fly right by you.

11:38.197 --> 11:41.158
Yeah. Wheels office. 8:00.

11:41.242 --> 11:43.994
-All right. Bye-bye. I love you.
-Yeah. I love you too.

11:46.038 --> 11:48.040
[birds chirping]

12:17.570 --> 12:19.447
Where else would you rather be?

12:23.742 --> 12:25.744
-Morning, love.
-Morning, Jeff.

12:27.580 --> 12:31.250
All righty.
What's on the docket for today?

12:32.585 --> 12:34.295
[typing]

12:36.755 --> 12:37.798
Nikki!

12:44.805 --> 12:47.224
-[sighs] Morning, team.
-[vacuum whirring]

12:48.142 --> 12:50.811
[Dana] How are we this, um… [sputters]

12:50.895 --> 12:52.354
Uh, finally.

12:52.771 --> 12:56.358
We've had a little surprise
shake up here this morning.

12:56.442 --> 12:59.361
Oh, by surprise you mean the e-mail
you got three days ago?

12:59.445 --> 13:00.696
Isn't that the one, Jeff?

13:00.779 --> 13:02.698
I've been a bit behind on the admin.

13:02.781 --> 13:07.161
Seems we're getting an impromptu visit
from our friends at ITCM Financial.

13:07.244 --> 13:09.413
They're sending someone
to do an inspection.

13:09.497 --> 13:12.416
Is that normal?
I mean, we never hear from those guys.

13:12.500 --> 13:15.085
Yeah, Jeff,
why are they suddenly showing up?

13:15.169 --> 13:16.545
Everything's okay, yeah, Dad?

13:16.629 --> 13:19.298
I'm sure it's just routine,
you know, check the books,

13:19.381 --> 13:22.384
make sure everything's in order,
that sort of thing. [chuckles]

13:22.510 --> 13:25.554
-Okay, when do they get here?
-Yeah, why don't you tell us?

13:25.638 --> 13:29.183
-[hesitates] Their ferry is due in a…
-[foghorn blaring]

13:32.228 --> 13:34.063
-You're kidding.
-Afraid not.

13:34.146 --> 13:37.983
We need you to go and get him
while we finish up around here.

13:38.067 --> 13:41.111
Huh? I can't. I have a mail drop
at Packers Bay today.

13:41.195 --> 13:42.821
The drop can wait, love.

13:42.905 --> 13:45.282
Besides, you're the face
of Fullerton Airways.

13:45.366 --> 13:47.409
You should be the first one
to greet our guest.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.537
-But, Dad--
-His name's Mitchell.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.207
Maybe take the scenic route
back through town

13:53.290 --> 13:57.086
so we can finish up around here.
And be nice.

14:09.848 --> 14:11.475
[Dana] You must be Mr. Mitchell.

14:12.101 --> 14:14.603
-Pardon?
-Uh, the suit tends to be a dead giveaway.

14:14.687 --> 14:18.065
-My suit?
-I'm Dana. Fullerton Airways. Welcome.

14:18.148 --> 14:19.900
-Let's get it going.
-Look, miss, I think--

14:19.984 --> 14:22.653
Look, no offense,
but I've got a schedule to keep up,

14:22.736 --> 14:24.864
so we're gonna make this a bit snappy.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.740
I'm here to visit my cousin
for a few days.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.451
-Huh?
-So, if you don't mind, have a lovely day.

14:33.414 --> 14:34.874
[William] Um… [clears throat]

14:39.753 --> 14:42.006
Wait, you're Mr. Mitchell?

14:42.089 --> 14:45.759
-Yes. Well, uh, William.
-Dana.

14:46.635 --> 14:48.470
You must be Mr. Randall's assistant.

14:49.263 --> 14:51.098
-[Dana] Chief pilot, actually.
-Ah.

14:52.182 --> 14:53.350
This way.

14:54.518 --> 14:55.811
[softly] Wanker.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.814
This is, is it?

14:58.898 --> 15:00.816
-Yeah, this is it.
-Right.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.651
Chuck your bags in the back here.

15:03.277 --> 15:06.405
-Chop, chop. We've got work to do.
-All right. [clears throat]

15:09.241 --> 15:10.534
[Dana exhales]

15:20.419 --> 15:22.963
[William] So, this is… This is Fullerton?

15:23.672 --> 15:24.673
[Dana] This is it.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.260
It's a long flight
just to make a quick pop-in.

15:28.344 --> 15:32.640
-Anything I should be worried about?
-No, no, it's, uh…

15:32.723 --> 15:36.435
Just wanted to see how you do things
around here, that's all.

15:37.227 --> 15:38.312
Copy that.

15:41.148 --> 15:42.942
Here we are. Fullerton Airways.

15:44.568 --> 15:45.736
[William] Very quaint.

16:00.918 --> 16:02.294
Too much, Dad.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.088
[chuckles] You must be William Mitchell.

16:04.171 --> 16:06.090
-Yes.
-Jeff Randall.

16:06.173 --> 16:09.134
Welcome to Fullerton Airways,
the region's favorite carrier.

16:09.218 --> 16:11.720
-Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Randall.
-Jeff, mate.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.305
-Jeff.
-[Jeff] This is Nikki.

16:13.389 --> 16:16.225
She's our mechanic and resident tech whiz.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.935
If it's broken, she can fix it.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.772
-Very nice to meet you.
-How do you do?

16:21.855 --> 16:23.107
Good. I do good.

16:25.025 --> 16:28.195
Let's take you on a tour
of our humble facilities.

16:28.278 --> 16:30.864
Fair warning.
Air conditioning is busted.

16:30.948 --> 16:33.867
Nikki's waiting for replacement parts.
Story of our lives.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.412
-[William] Right.
-I'm gonna do some checks on Harriet.

16:38.580 --> 16:39.748
Yep.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.418
My God.

16:43.085 --> 16:46.714
-He's just a stiff in a suit, all right?
-[Nikki] So hot.

16:46.797 --> 16:50.467
[William] Well. You certainly
weren't joking about the air conditioning.

16:50.968 --> 16:54.763
It's, um… It's, uh, rustic.

16:55.431 --> 16:59.351
Well, we like to keep things pretty
down to earth around here. [chuckles]

17:00.310 --> 17:01.311
[binders clatter]

17:01.395 --> 17:02.771
-Oh.
-[groans]

17:02.855 --> 17:03.939
[clears throat]

17:04.023 --> 17:05.399
-Please.
-It's fine.

17:06.650 --> 17:09.987
Uh, so, uh, how long
have you had the place?

17:10.070 --> 17:12.906
Uh, my wife and I set it up in '93.

17:12.990 --> 17:16.118
Next to our neighbors,
uh, we're a bit grassroots,

17:16.201 --> 17:19.830
but our customers have always
appreciated our personal style.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.707
Well, that's what they tell us anyway.

17:21.790 --> 17:23.459
[chuckles] I'm sure, yeah.

17:23.542 --> 17:24.918
What about you, Will?

17:25.919 --> 17:29.089
-What?
-Do you run a business with your wife?

17:31.300 --> 17:34.636
Um, no, I'm not married, actually.

17:34.720 --> 17:37.056
-Girlfriend?
-No, no girlfriend.

17:37.139 --> 17:38.223
-Boyfriend?
-[Dana] Ahem.

17:38.307 --> 17:39.391
No, I'm…

17:39.475 --> 17:40.851
[chuckles nervously]

17:40.934 --> 17:42.311
I'm single.

17:43.187 --> 17:44.563
-Interesting.
-Sorry?

17:47.357 --> 17:51.653
Um, so my record show
that you're predominantly a tour company.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.031
But I did want to ask
about the remote air--

17:54.114 --> 17:56.784
-Our remote air support.
-Remote air support. Right.

17:56.867 --> 17:59.495
Folks who live outside major cities
are often reliant

17:59.578 --> 18:02.039
on air delivery for, you know,

18:02.122 --> 18:03.874
-mail, supplies…
-Mmm-hmm.

18:03.957 --> 18:08.128
But, uh, we're re-evaluating
that side of the business.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.839
Remote air support
is the soul of Fullerton Airways.

18:11.632 --> 18:14.510
We've always done it, and we always will.

18:16.678 --> 18:17.721
Right.

18:18.764 --> 18:22.184
Um, I only ask because I…

18:22.267 --> 18:24.853
Well, I did do
a preliminary review of your accounts

18:24.937 --> 18:26.313
before I came, Mr. Randall.

18:26.396 --> 18:28.649
-Jeff, mate. Jeff.
-Yeah, Jeff.

18:28.732 --> 18:31.735
Well, it would seem the government
subsidizes your fuel

18:31.819 --> 18:34.780
-and your expenses for those flights.
-[Jeff] Yeah, that's right.

18:34.863 --> 18:38.408
Well, given the, um…
scale of your operation

18:38.492 --> 18:40.452
and, as you say,
the size of your competitors

18:40.536 --> 18:42.371
-and the fact that…
-[scoffs]

18:42.454 --> 18:47.417
Unless I'm mistaken, you do only have
one operational aircraft. Is that right?

18:48.502 --> 18:49.419
Well, it doesn't…

18:50.337 --> 18:54.383
It doesn't leave much room for… profit.

18:54.466 --> 18:56.426
There's more to life than profits,
you know.

18:57.052 --> 19:00.764
Yes, quite. Alas, it's rather a priority.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.267
What's the point
of this inspection anyway?

19:03.350 --> 19:05.602
You fly halfway
across the world to insult us?

19:05.686 --> 19:07.229
-[Jeff] Dana--
-What's going on?

19:07.312 --> 19:12.359
Why don't you, um, show Will Harriet,
and we'll tidy up around here?

19:15.070 --> 19:16.071
Sure.

19:17.489 --> 19:19.408
Not like I had anywhere to be.

19:23.287 --> 19:26.123
Here she is. Cessna 206.

19:26.206 --> 19:28.584
[William] Why Harriet,
if you don't mind me asking?

19:30.252 --> 19:32.129
[Dana] That's my mom's sense of humor.

19:32.838 --> 19:33.714
Right.

19:33.797 --> 19:37.009
Uh, Harriet as in
the female version of Harry.

19:38.510 --> 19:39.428
I don't get it.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.054
Harry Houdini.

19:41.138 --> 19:42.306
Harry Houdini?

19:42.389 --> 19:45.058
Harry Houdini, the magician,
straightjacket, Harry Houdini?

19:45.142 --> 19:49.271
Yeah, well, Houdini was the first person
to make a controlled flight in Australia.

19:50.856 --> 19:54.151
Diggers Rest, Victoria, 18th March, 1910.

19:55.903 --> 19:56.904
I didn't know that.

19:56.987 --> 20:00.490
[Dana] Yeah, well, my mom was a nut
for aviation history.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.162
Well, it seems the apple didn't fall
very far from the tree.

20:06.205 --> 20:09.291
I suppose you'd, um, have to be a…

20:10.083 --> 20:12.377
A bit of a nut to fly a thing like this,
wouldn't you?

20:15.339 --> 20:16.590
You know… [clears throat]

20:18.175 --> 20:20.761
I have a delivery scheduled
for this morning.

20:22.846 --> 20:24.097
Why don't we go up?

20:24.848 --> 20:27.309
Um, in this?

20:27.392 --> 20:30.312
Yeah. She's sturdy as a rock. Come on.

20:33.732 --> 20:38.654
Right. Big aerodynamic rock.

20:47.454 --> 20:48.372
Strap in.

20:49.206 --> 20:50.332
Right.

20:51.917 --> 20:53.919
[Jeff over radio] What you up to, folks?

20:54.002 --> 20:56.129
I'm giving our guest
a little demonstration.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.965
Um, copy that.

20:58.048 --> 21:01.802
Well, I hope you and our extremely
important guest have a good time.

21:02.594 --> 21:03.971
A really good time.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.055
[Nikki chuckles]

21:08.100 --> 21:09.851
[William] Cozy in here, isn't it?

21:11.395 --> 21:14.898
-You've been doing this long?
-[Dana] All my life.

21:16.400 --> 21:17.526
[William] That's good.

21:21.571 --> 21:24.783
This is Foxtrot November Bravo,
requesting runway clearance.

21:25.284 --> 21:27.995
-[Jeff] Roger that. You're good to go.
-All righty.

21:28.078 --> 21:29.538
[engine revving]

21:49.516 --> 21:50.726
Okay, sit back.

21:53.353 --> 21:54.438
[William] Oh, my…

21:55.272 --> 21:56.440
[exhales]

22:11.455 --> 22:13.457
[Dana] Like I said, sturdy as a rock.

22:15.417 --> 22:17.085
Yeah, it's a good time.

22:18.295 --> 22:20.339
-I'm having a good time.
-You all right?

22:22.049 --> 22:23.508
It's tight fit, isn't it?

22:23.592 --> 22:25.385
I don't know where to put my hands.

22:25.469 --> 22:27.429
Like if I touch something, it's gonna…

22:27.512 --> 22:30.057
Just put your hands down.
Just put them there.

22:30.140 --> 22:32.434
Man, you poms just can't hack it, can you?

22:32.517 --> 22:35.604
I was in a hot air balloon once.
It's not really the same.

22:37.105 --> 22:40.484
What happens if something did go wrong?

22:40.567 --> 22:42.819
-Are there parachutes in the back?
-Only one.

22:43.695 --> 22:44.571
It's not funny.

22:44.654 --> 22:46.198
[laughs]

22:46.281 --> 22:49.034
You know, I've had experiences
when I was young, I was…

22:49.117 --> 22:51.870
Not a plane exactly,
but small spaces, you know.

22:53.497 --> 22:56.291
You gonna talk this much
the whole time we're up here?

22:56.374 --> 22:58.460
[breathing heavily] What?

22:59.795 --> 23:01.129
[wind blows]

23:01.213 --> 23:03.715
Whoa. Okay.

23:05.675 --> 23:06.927
I'm sorry.

23:07.928 --> 23:09.346
Not a bother.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.600
Can I ask… How old is this plane?

23:13.683 --> 23:14.851
She'll be 52 in June.

23:14.935 --> 23:17.646
Fif… Oh, my God.

23:17.729 --> 23:20.023
Look over there, you can see Mount Abbot.

23:20.107 --> 23:21.399
Very pretty.

23:23.026 --> 23:24.986
Oh. Oh, well…

23:26.655 --> 23:27.823
[William groans softly]

23:29.741 --> 23:31.952
Okay. What are you doing?

23:32.035 --> 23:33.620
Have a look out.

23:35.705 --> 23:37.624
Oh, my.

23:44.214 --> 23:45.549
[chuckles]

24:01.815 --> 24:03.316
All right, sit back.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.819
We're about to come in for our landing.

24:15.704 --> 24:16.788
[William groans]

24:24.129 --> 24:25.172
That was fun.

24:29.342 --> 24:31.011
[Dana] Welcome to Packers Bay.

24:31.094 --> 24:33.054
We do drops here every two weeks.

24:33.763 --> 24:35.974
Without us, they'd be totally cut off.

24:43.565 --> 24:46.067
Do you… Should I stay here?

24:46.151 --> 24:48.320
What for? They won't bite.

24:50.530 --> 24:51.448
Great.

24:54.743 --> 24:59.080
Great. And I'm gonna go outside.
I'm gonna look like a complete idiot.

24:59.915 --> 25:01.499
I'm gonna ruin these shoes.

25:06.129 --> 25:07.923
-Hey gang.
-Hey, Dana.

25:08.006 --> 25:11.134
[Dana] Sorry for the delay.
Okey-dokey. We've got mail for

25:11.218 --> 25:14.346
Nick, Serena, Shane. How lucky.

25:20.810 --> 25:23.146
Brought your boyfriend along
for the ride, eh, Dana?

25:23.813 --> 25:26.316
Sorry to disappoint,
but he's a bigwig from the UK.

25:27.275 --> 25:30.070
He's come to check if we're spending
our money responsibly.

25:30.153 --> 25:32.614
[Serena] Well,
they're doing a bang-up job.

25:32.697 --> 25:37.202
-If it were me, I'd give them a raise.
-Yes, well, yeah, I'm sure they are.

25:38.578 --> 25:41.414
You heard about that nasty weather
brewing off the coast?

25:41.498 --> 25:43.083
[Dana] I don't know anything you don't.

25:43.166 --> 25:45.877
Any luck, she'll drift south
like the last one did.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.088
I need to get Becky an X-ray
appointment the 19th.

25:48.171 --> 25:50.340
-Are you available then?
-I think so.

25:52.384 --> 25:55.011
-Hey, guys, do you mind if I play?
-Yeah.

25:55.971 --> 25:57.597
Me and you'll be on a team. Okay?

26:00.767 --> 26:02.769
Oh, hand ball, ladies and gentlemen.

26:10.819 --> 26:12.862
-You did it.
-[Dana] Having fun?

26:12.946 --> 26:15.991
Oh. Well, yeah. You know,
they look like professionals.

26:16.074 --> 26:19.536
I thought maybe they can
teach me a thing or two.

26:19.619 --> 26:22.122
It's time to get going,
if you're ready, of course.

26:22.205 --> 26:24.249
Yes. Yeah, of course.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.794
-Bye all.
-[all] Bye, Dana.

26:29.754 --> 26:30.672
Bye.

26:52.027 --> 26:53.695
[country music playing]

26:54.738 --> 26:56.531
-Howdy, howdy.
-Hey.

26:56.614 --> 26:58.575
Heath, this is William. William, Heath.

26:58.658 --> 27:01.453
-G'day.
-Hi. G'day. Good… Good day.

27:01.536 --> 27:03.705
[chuckles] You're the one checking in?

27:03.788 --> 27:05.540
Yeah. Yes, I think so, yeah.

27:08.585 --> 27:11.171
No worries.
Give me a second and I'll grab the key.

27:14.466 --> 27:17.052
Thank you very much
for the demonstration today.

27:17.135 --> 27:21.973
It was very, uh, educational,
if not spotted with terror.

27:22.057 --> 27:23.558
Oh, don't mention it.

27:27.896 --> 27:30.815
-Well, it's been fun.
-Yeah.

27:30.899 --> 27:33.693
Probably won't see you much
while you're here, so, uh,

27:34.527 --> 27:36.946
-take it easy.
-All right.

27:44.871 --> 27:46.414
Quite a character, isn't she?

27:47.082 --> 27:50.168
Yes. Yes, very tenacious.

27:50.251 --> 27:51.669
Mate, you have no idea.

27:52.420 --> 27:54.130
Here you go. Apartment number two.

27:54.214 --> 27:57.217
Across the tarmac,
up the stairs, and second on your left.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.259
Right.

27:59.427 --> 28:00.804
Across the tarmac.

28:02.680 --> 28:04.474
Across the tarmac, okay.

28:05.600 --> 28:06.601
Across the tarmac.

28:11.773 --> 28:12.857
[sighs]

28:19.280 --> 28:21.991
[groans softly] Oh, my God.

28:32.502 --> 28:33.753
[panting] Oh, God.

28:40.885 --> 28:43.888
-Oh, thank God. Oh, thank God.
-[cell phone ringing]

28:55.608 --> 28:56.609
Hi, Dad.

28:56.693 --> 28:58.862
Ah, are you settled in yet?

28:58.945 --> 29:00.864
How's the arse end of the world?

29:00.947 --> 29:04.826
Um, well, you know,
I suppose it has its charms.

29:05.827 --> 29:08.246
They're certainly
a tightly knit community here.

29:08.329 --> 29:12.375
Don't start getting attached.
Have you reviewed their financials yet?

29:14.377 --> 29:18.548
No. No, I haven't quite done that yet,
but I will.

29:18.631 --> 29:20.759
Time is of the essence, William.

29:20.842 --> 29:24.053
Shut that place down. Get yourself home.

29:24.137 --> 29:25.555
[line disconnects]

29:32.270 --> 29:33.271
[exhales]

29:56.836 --> 29:58.004
[clears throat]

29:59.672 --> 30:00.715
Knock, knock.

30:08.097 --> 30:09.057
Hello.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.351
-Morning, Will!
-Oh, my giddy aunt.

30:11.434 --> 30:13.728
-Sleep well?
-Uh, yeah. Yeah.

30:13.812 --> 30:15.605
You know, the heat notwithstanding.

30:15.688 --> 30:17.357
Losing the tie might help.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.068
This is the tropics, mate.
You should relax a bit.

30:20.151 --> 30:21.236
Yeah.

30:21.319 --> 30:22.487
Well, this is you.

30:22.570 --> 30:24.405
-Feel free to settle in.
-Great.

30:24.489 --> 30:28.117
Well, I'm ready to jump
into those financials if you are.

30:28.201 --> 30:29.327
Uh, yeah, the financials.

30:29.410 --> 30:32.288
I definitely do have them,
just finalizing some reporting.

30:32.372 --> 30:35.500
-Morning.
-Ah, here she is. Ready to start the day.

30:35.583 --> 30:37.085
-[Dana] Morning.
-Morning.

30:37.168 --> 30:39.170
Here I am, like every other morning.

30:40.088 --> 30:41.381
Uh, have you seen Nikki?

30:41.464 --> 30:44.300
She's supposed to be helping me out
with the drops today.

30:44.384 --> 30:45.885
Well, actually, Nikki called.

30:45.969 --> 30:49.222
Her bike broke down on Macquarie Street,
so she'll be late.

30:49.305 --> 30:51.975
Seriously?
We can't afford another late start.

30:52.058 --> 30:54.769
We've got to get those first aid kits
to Wattle Hills.

30:56.229 --> 30:58.481
Hey, how about this?

30:59.440 --> 31:03.027
Why doesn't Will go out
and help you on your drops today, huh?

31:04.028 --> 31:05.196
Oh. [chuckles]

31:06.155 --> 31:07.907
-Him?
-Me?

31:07.991 --> 31:10.869
Well, why not? Dana needs help.

31:10.952 --> 31:14.289
And in the meantime,
I can get these reports ready for you.

31:14.372 --> 31:17.667
Seems a good solution for everybody.
What do you say?

31:18.334 --> 31:19.210
Good.

31:20.128 --> 31:21.880
-Great.
-Great.

31:30.680 --> 31:32.891
Do you really think
they're gonna hit it off?

31:32.974 --> 31:34.183
Yeah. Trust me.

31:34.934 --> 31:38.187
She never hangs out with anyone new.
This will be good for her.

31:38.271 --> 31:41.316
Plus, it can't hurt to make friends
with the money people.

31:42.483 --> 31:44.861
[Dana] You're handling it better
than you did yesterday.

31:46.321 --> 31:49.782
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm the epitome of a comfortable flyer.

31:49.866 --> 31:51.326
[both chuckle]

31:52.577 --> 31:54.537
So, what's life like
in ITCM financial?

31:54.621 --> 31:57.081
Must be pretty different
than doing this for living.

31:57.165 --> 32:00.543
Yes. Well, it's certainly less exciting.
Less life-threatening.

32:00.627 --> 32:03.838
Lots of fiscal projections
and revenue KPIs.

32:04.422 --> 32:08.259
Were you into that sort of thing as a kid?
Did you really love the spreadsheets?

32:09.010 --> 32:10.553
Not… Not so much.

32:11.638 --> 32:13.848
But Dad owned the business, you know,

32:14.515 --> 32:17.268
so it was just a given
that I was gonna end up there.

32:18.728 --> 32:20.271
That sounds familiar.

32:26.319 --> 32:27.737
Your dad seems very friendly.

32:27.820 --> 32:32.075
Oh, everyone loves Jeff,
and Jeff loves everyone back.

32:35.745 --> 32:37.538
What's it like working with him?

32:37.622 --> 32:39.165
I won't have it any other way.

32:41.125 --> 32:43.753
Doesn't mean
it doesn't get turbulent sometimes.

32:47.090 --> 32:50.718
-That was a flying pun, wasn't it?
-Depends if you found it funny or not.

32:55.264 --> 32:59.102
Sometimes he wants to take the business
in a different direction, that's all.

32:59.185 --> 33:00.728
He might be onto something.

33:00.812 --> 33:03.898
You could say he was charting
a different course.

33:06.734 --> 33:07.735
That was a flying pun.

33:09.028 --> 33:10.071
-[thumps]
-Oh!

33:13.741 --> 33:14.993
Come on.

33:21.666 --> 33:25.169
Is this… Is this like a vintage car
where it sort of has character?

33:25.253 --> 33:26.713
-[rattling]
-Something like that.

33:26.796 --> 33:29.298
That's normal? That's a normal sound?

33:29.382 --> 33:30.925
[alarm beeping]

33:32.051 --> 33:33.636
[engine sputtering]

33:34.887 --> 33:36.305
Oh, that's not a good sound.

33:36.389 --> 33:39.851
Mayday, mayday. Fullerton Airways,
this is Foxtrot November Bravo.

33:39.934 --> 33:41.102
Mayday?

33:41.185 --> 33:42.353
[Jeff] Dana, what's wrong?

33:42.437 --> 33:45.690
We're suffering engine failure
about five miles north of Sinclair Bay.

33:49.777 --> 33:52.572
I'll make an emergency landing.
Think it's the new exhaust valve.

33:52.655 --> 33:56.826
Foxtrot November Bravo,
Fullerton Airways. Copy that.

33:56.909 --> 33:59.620
Stay on frequency and advise on landing.

33:59.704 --> 34:00.663
And be safe.

34:01.914 --> 34:04.751
[William] Oh, my God. Okay.

34:06.586 --> 34:08.379
[breathing heavily] Okay, I feel like

34:08.463 --> 34:13.342
maybe this would be a good time
to tell you about my fear of flying.

34:16.429 --> 34:19.557
-Oh, my God.
-Come on.

34:21.309 --> 34:22.185
[William] Dana?

34:24.020 --> 34:26.606
Dana, Dana, Dana, that's very, very close.

34:41.996 --> 34:43.581
[sighs in relief]

34:58.846 --> 35:01.933
Let's never do that again, ever.

35:02.016 --> 35:04.602
Fullerton Airways, we're in one piece.

35:04.685 --> 35:07.438
I'm gonna go check out the damage.
I'll keep you posted.

35:07.522 --> 35:10.525
-Over.
-Roger that. Stay safe.

35:20.243 --> 35:22.995
[William] And now
it's zero operational aircraft.

35:23.746 --> 35:24.747
Wonderful.

35:27.708 --> 35:28.709
Right.

35:29.544 --> 35:31.796
So, where are we exactly?

35:31.879 --> 35:34.340
Uh, we're a little northwest
of Cape Flattery.

35:34.423 --> 35:36.259
It's not far from Lizard Island.

35:36.717 --> 35:39.303
Lizard Island? That's… That's good.

35:40.471 --> 35:44.392
So, what do we do now?
We light up a flare or something or?

35:45.101 --> 35:45.935
Nope.

35:46.018 --> 35:47.728
What do you mean "no"? What, no?

35:47.812 --> 35:50.773
It will be hours before someone's able
to come pick us up.

35:50.857 --> 35:53.526
Plus, I'd have to leave Harriet.
There's no way.

35:54.277 --> 35:56.988
If you want something done,
you have to do it yourself.

35:57.697 --> 35:58.781
Come on.

36:02.743 --> 36:04.120
Pass me the shifter.

36:04.829 --> 36:06.455
-Shifter?
-It's that thing there.

36:08.082 --> 36:08.958
To the right.

36:11.043 --> 36:12.461
The other right.

36:14.672 --> 36:16.048
Thank you.

36:18.843 --> 36:19.719
Come here.

36:21.387 --> 36:23.681
I need you to come
and push down over here.

36:24.265 --> 36:26.142
-In there?
-Yeah. There.

36:28.311 --> 36:30.563
Yeah. Now, don't loosen the pressure.

36:30.646 --> 36:32.273
I'm not loosening the pressure.

36:39.322 --> 36:40.823
Um…

36:40.907 --> 36:44.243
[chuckles] You may have pressed
a little too hard.

36:44.327 --> 36:46.871
Okay, but I didn't loosen the pressure.

36:48.623 --> 36:51.834
Okay. I'm gonna need
a Phillips head screwdriver next.

36:51.918 --> 36:54.754
Ah-ha. I know that one.

36:57.048 --> 36:58.090
Thank you.

37:20.112 --> 37:22.156
Okay, cross your fingers.

37:23.074 --> 37:24.867
[engine sputtering]

37:29.038 --> 37:30.039
Come on.

37:34.669 --> 37:35.836
Come on, girl.

37:38.631 --> 37:40.633
[engine starts]

37:43.135 --> 37:44.679
These are good sounds.

37:46.806 --> 37:49.475
This feels good. This does feel good.

38:01.904 --> 38:03.322
[laughs]

38:10.454 --> 38:12.748
Oh… bravo.

38:14.583 --> 38:16.460
We know what we're doing.

38:21.257 --> 38:22.675
[all] Cheers!

38:22.758 --> 38:26.137
Will, who am I? "Oh, my God! Oh, my God!"

38:26.220 --> 38:27.471
That's very funny.

38:27.555 --> 38:29.765
Oi, leave him. Poor fellow.

38:29.849 --> 38:33.060
He's only been on the job for two days,
he's already fixing planes.

38:33.144 --> 38:34.061
Thank you, Nikki.

38:34.145 --> 38:38.190
-Fixing plane…
-Okay, all right. Forget her, all right?

38:38.274 --> 38:41.902
If you get over this finance stuff,
come work for me as my assistant.

38:41.986 --> 38:43.571
That's a very attractive offer.

38:43.654 --> 38:45.197
-Don't do that.
-No, I'd like that.

38:46.324 --> 38:49.452
-It would be an honor, actually, for him.
-[cell phone chimes]

38:51.912 --> 38:53.164
-Oh, sorry.
-You…

38:53.247 --> 38:55.458
-No, no, no.
-Please.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.381
-[Heath] Howdy, howdy.
-Hi.

39:02.465 --> 39:05.426
It's been a long time since I've seen you
look that way at anything

39:05.509 --> 39:07.845
-that didn't have wings and fuselage.
-Excuse me?

39:07.928 --> 39:09.764
I'm just trying to be a good host.

39:10.598 --> 39:12.058
Seems like a nice enough guy.

39:12.767 --> 39:14.727
Not entirely sure
about the wardrobe choices.

39:14.810 --> 39:16.437
Mmm. Tell me about it.

39:32.453 --> 39:34.288
-[Heath] Can you do us all a favor?
-Mmm?

39:34.372 --> 39:35.331
Don't screw it up.

39:36.248 --> 39:38.793
I'm sorry.
But, would you mind your own business?

39:38.876 --> 39:40.586
Say hi to your boyfriend for me.

39:48.636 --> 39:51.013
Oh, subtle way of getting cut off, okay.

39:51.097 --> 39:53.349
-It's for Dad, really.
-[all laughing]

39:53.432 --> 39:56.394
[reporter on TV] More on that
category 3 low pressure system

39:56.477 --> 39:58.270
gathering momentum off the coast.

39:58.354 --> 40:02.233
Although presently forecast to continue
moving in a south easterly direction,

40:02.316 --> 40:05.027
tropical storms of this type
are difficult to predict.

40:05.111 --> 40:06.737
The Bureau of Meteorology has issued…

40:06.821 --> 40:09.824
Yikes. I hope that one fizzles out.

40:13.953 --> 40:17.373
-You okay there, buddy?
-Yes. Yeah, very good. Really good.

40:18.624 --> 40:20.418
[man] Hello, Australia.
Welcome to the gala.

40:20.501 --> 40:21.836
You play, Will?

40:21.919 --> 40:24.588
Yeah. Oh, yeah.
Just about since I could walk.

40:25.297 --> 40:26.424
Oh, boy, here we go.

40:26.507 --> 40:27.842
Well, well, well.

40:28.634 --> 40:30.761
Hope you're not too sore about the Ashes.

40:30.845 --> 40:33.722
That's too soon, Jeff. That's too soon.

40:34.473 --> 40:35.349
Sorry, mate.

40:35.433 --> 40:39.353
[groans] We felt the pain
at Lord's that day, I can assure you.

40:39.437 --> 40:40.646
You were there in person?

40:41.397 --> 40:45.484
Yeah, well, Dad's a member, so we…
You know, he's got good seats.

40:45.568 --> 40:48.320
Oh. I bet you and your dad were fuming.

40:48.404 --> 40:49.530
Well, he wasn't there.

40:49.613 --> 40:52.074
Um, in fact, I'm not sure
he's ever come to a match.

40:55.744 --> 40:56.787
His loss.

40:59.206 --> 41:02.126
Well, maybe it's better
that he wasn't there

41:02.209 --> 41:05.045
-given the thrashing we gave you.
-[all laugh]

41:05.129 --> 41:07.047
-He doesn't hold back, does he?
-[Dana] No

41:07.673 --> 41:09.467
[Nikki] Down it, Uncle.

41:10.301 --> 41:12.470
Night, kids, I'm gonna hit the hay.

41:12.553 --> 41:16.182
All that paperwork you need will be there
in the morning, ready for you.

41:16.265 --> 41:17.099
Right.

41:17.183 --> 41:20.644
I think you'll see that
there's a bit of life in the old girl yet.

41:22.897 --> 41:25.733
-Yes. Yeah, I'm sure there is.
-See you, kids.

41:25.816 --> 41:27.485
-Night, Dad.
-[Nikki] Goodnight.

41:30.070 --> 41:33.491
Okay, peeps. That is me, I'm out.
I'll see you both tomorrow.

41:33.574 --> 41:35.784
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

41:35.868 --> 41:40.039
Dana, you can't go
because you have to walk Will home.

41:40.122 --> 41:43.918
-Oh, I think he's fine.
-I'm just on the tarmac.

41:44.001 --> 41:48.130
I appreciate you trying to be
a strong independent man,

41:48.214 --> 41:51.967
but it's dangerous out there, okay?
Drop bears.

41:53.260 --> 41:54.261
Drop bears?

41:55.429 --> 41:56.514
You need a guide.

41:58.599 --> 42:02.645
Well, I mean, sure, I mean…

42:03.395 --> 42:05.940
It'll be nice to have a guide, I suppose.

42:11.946 --> 42:14.782
What's it like
living in a place like this?

42:15.574 --> 42:18.160
A lovely place, a lovely place like this?

42:19.411 --> 42:22.289
Well, everybody knows everybody.

42:23.249 --> 42:25.709
Everyone knows everyone's business.

42:25.793 --> 42:29.171
What they don't know about you,
they will assume pretty quick.

42:30.172 --> 42:33.884
Also, if you have a break up,
get used to seeing your ex every day

42:33.968 --> 42:36.554
because they're probably making
your morning coffee.

42:37.221 --> 42:39.765
Right, I will… I will bear that in mind.

42:40.599 --> 42:46.272
No. But honestly,
no pollution, no noise, no traffic,

42:47.398 --> 42:49.149
and your neighbors are like family.

42:49.900 --> 42:53.737
I'm lucky because that family stretches
from Fullerton

42:53.821 --> 42:57.032
to the Lockhart River,
1600 kilometers round trip.

42:58.117 --> 42:59.201
That's my home.

43:01.662 --> 43:03.956
And what about your parents?

43:04.873 --> 43:06.875
I mean, why did they want to live here?

43:08.419 --> 43:10.921
It was my mom. Clara.

43:12.256 --> 43:14.883
She was so passionate about our community.

43:14.967 --> 43:17.636
She always believed in giving back
and helping others.

43:20.180 --> 43:21.432
And she loved to fly.

43:24.268 --> 43:27.479
I mean, Fullerton Airways was her dream.

43:30.941 --> 43:33.527
-Sorry, I didn't mean to…
-No, no, no.

43:35.362 --> 43:38.032
I guess that's why I'm so protective
because…

43:39.658 --> 43:42.578
Well, it's the last part of her
that I still have.

43:43.912 --> 43:46.415
-Maybe that's weird though.
-No.

43:47.291 --> 43:48.792
No, it isn't at all.

43:48.876 --> 43:51.879
I mean, that's the perk
of the small town life.

43:51.962 --> 43:54.506
You see, when Mom…

43:55.633 --> 43:57.259
Well, yeah.

43:58.010 --> 44:01.263
Dad and I, we never felt alone, ever.

44:02.181 --> 44:03.599
That helped a lot.

44:04.642 --> 44:06.101
Yeah, I can imagine.

44:07.853 --> 44:09.563
-Anyway, what about you?
-Me?

44:09.647 --> 44:13.108
Growing up in the big city,
next in line to your dad's throne,

44:13.192 --> 44:15.069
-what's that like?
-Um…

44:16.612 --> 44:19.740
To be honest, it's pretty boring.

44:21.200 --> 44:25.621
You know, Dad owned a multimillion-pound
company, he didn't…

44:27.206 --> 44:29.124
Didn't really have time for, um,

44:30.125 --> 44:33.962
well, school fetes, rugby matches,
that sort of thing.

44:34.046 --> 44:36.048
-Never would have guessed.
-[chuckles]

44:38.217 --> 44:41.929
Yeah, it turns out, working for him
wasn't really all that different.

44:43.097 --> 44:45.891
You know, you can always
take Nikki up on her offer.

44:45.974 --> 44:47.434
A little change of scenery,

44:47.518 --> 44:49.144
-get your hands dirty.
-Yep.

44:49.228 --> 44:51.647
I think you'll look pretty good
in a pair of overalls.

44:51.730 --> 44:53.023
-Do you?
-Mmm.

44:53.107 --> 44:54.566
They go well with my brogues.

44:54.650 --> 44:56.777
Not so sure about that bit though.

45:05.452 --> 45:08.455
-[William] Wow.
-Yeah. It's pretty beautiful, huh?

45:09.373 --> 45:11.208
It doesn't look like this back home.

45:16.213 --> 45:20.008
-[Dana] So, that's the emu in the sky.
-Okay.

45:20.092 --> 45:24.471
That one is special because it's outlined
by the dark areas of the night sky,

45:24.555 --> 45:26.640
-not by the stars.
-Mmm.

45:26.723 --> 45:30.686
It's been featured in traditional
storytelling for thousands of years.

45:31.645 --> 45:33.355
That's beautiful.

45:35.023 --> 45:37.526
Oh. That one over there you can see,
that's actually--

45:37.609 --> 45:41.071
-Southern Cross. Is it?
-Bingo.

45:41.155 --> 45:42.197
I knew that.

45:44.366 --> 45:48.162
Oh, that big, bad boy over there,
that's the Tarantula Nebula.

45:49.204 --> 45:50.789
-Tarantula?
-Mmm-hmm.

45:51.999 --> 45:55.961
-It seems rather fitting for this place.
-[chuckles]

45:57.087 --> 45:58.005
Yeah.

45:59.506 --> 46:00.424
You know…

46:04.094 --> 46:05.304
I'm very impressed.

46:06.930 --> 46:09.892
Well, they're handy to know.

46:10.809 --> 46:12.311
When push comes to shove,

46:13.061 --> 46:15.731
a pilot can always count on them
to point the way.

46:18.901 --> 46:22.279
-[koala bellowing]
-Oh! Oh, my God! What is that?

46:22.362 --> 46:24.448
-Relax. [laughs]
-No, what's that?

46:24.531 --> 46:27.534
-No, that's not funny. What is that?
-That is a koala.

46:27.618 --> 46:29.077
-A koala?
-Yes.

46:29.161 --> 46:30.621
That sounds like a dinosaur.

46:31.246 --> 46:34.208
No, this country's too much.
[sighs in relief]

46:34.833 --> 46:36.877
Oh, my gosh, Nikki was right.

46:36.960 --> 46:39.880
-What was Nikki right about?
-You really do need me here.

46:42.174 --> 46:43.675
I don't disagree with her.

46:44.468 --> 46:45.969
[both chuckle]

46:49.264 --> 46:53.727
Well, um, thank you for protecting me.

46:53.810 --> 46:56.939
It was, um, both pathetic
and English of me.

47:02.736 --> 47:04.154
Have fun with Jeff tomorrow.

47:05.030 --> 47:07.074
-Yeah.
-And today was a total write-off,

47:07.157 --> 47:09.243
I'll be slammed
trying to catch up tomorrow.

47:10.285 --> 47:13.956
Well, I mean, I'd be very happy to help.

47:14.039 --> 47:16.124
Properly this time, I mean.

47:16.917 --> 47:18.001
With drops?

47:18.710 --> 47:19.586
Yeah.

47:19.670 --> 47:21.380
What about your work?

47:22.798 --> 47:26.718
Well, I still have a few days left.

47:27.761 --> 47:30.722
And, you know,
I like to make sure that I'm making

47:30.806 --> 47:33.433
a thorough appraisal of my work.

47:35.519 --> 47:37.062
-Right.
-[both chuckle]

47:38.188 --> 47:40.023
It's the least I can do.

47:40.107 --> 47:42.609
I've taken up so much
of your time already.

47:44.194 --> 47:49.074
Well, uh, yeah, I guess I could use
some help picking up the slack.

47:49.658 --> 47:52.619
Right. Right. Good.

47:52.703 --> 47:54.788
Good, great. Great, fantastic.

47:56.456 --> 47:59.710
Well, I'll see you in the morning.

48:00.627 --> 48:02.170
Yeah. 0800.

48:02.254 --> 48:03.422
Roger. Roger.

48:04.214 --> 48:07.009
I'm not kidding.
If you're not there, I'll fly without you.

48:07.843 --> 48:09.219
Yes, ma'am.

48:40.751 --> 48:42.377
I believe this is yours.

48:43.837 --> 48:46.173
Yeah. Yes. Thank you.

48:47.257 --> 48:49.009
Thank you. [clears throat]

48:49.092 --> 48:50.719
[engine starts]

49:08.153 --> 49:08.987
[mouthing]

49:28.382 --> 49:32.636
Mary, before you go,
have you heard from my son?

49:32.719 --> 49:36.098
[Mary over phone] Nothing yet, sir.
I'll be sure to let you know.

50:09.172 --> 50:11.508
Oh, you…

50:11.591 --> 50:14.386
-[both laugh]
-[Dana] Okay. Put me down.

50:19.975 --> 50:23.103
Not bad, city boy.
Now I am back on schedule.

50:24.020 --> 50:24.855
Oi, Will?

50:26.565 --> 50:27.399
You keen?

50:29.359 --> 50:31.361
You heard the man. Keen?

50:32.279 --> 50:35.490
[voicemail] This is William Mitchell.
Please leave a message.

50:35.574 --> 50:36.408
[phone beeps]

50:36.491 --> 50:38.034
William, what the hell is going on?

50:38.118 --> 50:40.620
It's as if you've wandered off
the face of the earth.

50:40.704 --> 50:42.706
The board is less than impressed.

50:43.957 --> 50:45.167
Call me immediately.

50:46.710 --> 50:48.712
["Roll the Dice" playing]

51:03.185 --> 51:04.060
No ball.

51:14.070 --> 51:15.530
-Wide.
-Dad!

51:43.683 --> 51:45.101
[all cheering]

51:53.568 --> 51:54.820
It was a good game.

51:54.903 --> 51:57.572
Yes, you've got a rather
spirited fast ball, haven't you?

51:58.532 --> 52:00.283
Yeah, well, I learned from the best.

52:00.367 --> 52:03.078
Listen, I've been…
My father and me just…

52:03.161 --> 52:05.622
-[cell phone ringing]
-Sorry.

52:10.085 --> 52:11.586
Look, I've got to take this.

52:11.670 --> 52:13.547
-Is that all right?
-Yeah. No worries.

52:15.382 --> 52:17.801
[clears throat] Hello, D.

52:17.884 --> 52:18.969
Hi, Nikki.

52:19.052 --> 52:21.221
[Duncan] William,
the board meets in two days,

52:21.304 --> 52:23.723
and I haven't heard from you.
What's the delay?

52:23.807 --> 52:28.728
Well, actually, Dad, I have, um…
I have been meaning to call. I, um…

52:30.897 --> 52:32.774
I feel like maybe I was too hasty.

52:32.858 --> 52:35.110
Uh, check it out. Finally.
Better late than never.

52:35.193 --> 52:36.403
Is that the new bilge pump?

52:36.486 --> 52:38.572
No, I wish, it's for the air con.

52:38.655 --> 52:42.075
-At least that will make Will happy.
-And my sweaty pits,

52:42.158 --> 52:44.494
-which is more important to me.
-Fair enough.

52:44.578 --> 52:47.289
I think maybe my assessment
was off, and, um,

52:48.039 --> 52:51.001
upon review, I feel like
there are unforeseen advantages

52:51.084 --> 52:53.503
to keeping Fullerton Airways operational.

52:53.587 --> 52:55.255
Your assessment was off?

52:55.797 --> 52:56.715
Yeah.

52:58.550 --> 53:01.720
Do you really think I wouldn't have
my team verify your figures?

53:02.304 --> 53:04.139
Your assessment was right on target.

53:04.222 --> 53:06.641
A stiff breeze would knock the place over.

53:06.725 --> 53:08.602
What are you not telling me?

53:08.685 --> 53:13.356
Well, you know, since I've been here
on the ground and I've met the team,

53:13.440 --> 53:16.276
I think… I think terminating them
would be a mistake.

53:18.403 --> 53:19.738
[thunder rumbling]

53:25.952 --> 53:29.164
-Oh, bugger.
-[Duncan] What have I always told you?

53:29.247 --> 53:32.667
Never let it become personal.
It just makes it all the more difficult.

53:32.751 --> 53:35.420
I suppose now's your opportunity
to learn that lesson.

53:36.129 --> 53:39.549
Dad, please don't shut down
Fullerton Airways. Please don't do this.

53:40.300 --> 53:45.430
William, either do your job
or don't bother returning to work.

53:46.139 --> 53:49.726
This is for your own good.
And one day you'll thank me.

54:02.447 --> 54:03.698
[sighs]

54:03.782 --> 54:05.283
[thunder rumbling]

54:22.842 --> 54:23.885
Oh, God.

54:23.969 --> 54:25.971
Who the hell do you think you are?

54:26.054 --> 54:28.598
-Please let me explain.
-Is this how you usually play it?

54:28.682 --> 54:31.059
You show up, worm your way in,
take a holiday.

54:31.142 --> 54:33.853
-"Worm my way in"?
-Then you stab everyone in the back.

54:33.937 --> 54:35.689
Dana, I intend to stop this.

54:35.772 --> 54:37.732
Okay. Don't make promises.

54:37.816 --> 54:40.193
I heard that it pretty much
sounds like a done deal.

54:40.276 --> 54:42.529
Because I haven't come up
with a better plan--

54:42.612 --> 54:44.948
Save it! Where's Dad?

54:45.031 --> 54:46.950
I've got to figure out what to do.

54:47.033 --> 54:50.286
-Can you just give me a second, please?
-Give you a second?

54:50.370 --> 54:52.998
-[cell phone chimes]
-This wasn't a very easy situation for me.

54:53.081 --> 54:54.749
You've done enough. Just go.

54:54.833 --> 54:55.959
-Dana.
-Guys.

54:56.042 --> 54:57.669
-Can you hear me out?
-I've heard you.

54:57.752 --> 54:59.754
Do you think this was easy for me?

54:59.838 --> 55:02.215
-Do you have any idea--
-Just leave!

55:02.298 --> 55:04.175
-[bangs]
-Guys!

55:04.884 --> 55:07.512
-Yes?
-Cyclone. It's on the way.

55:09.764 --> 55:11.224
-I'm sorry, what?
-Oh, shit.

55:13.018 --> 55:15.770
-What "Oh, shit"?
-[siren blaring]

55:17.981 --> 55:18.815
Where's Dad?

55:18.898 --> 55:21.359
-[siren blaring]
-[thunder rumbling]

55:21.443 --> 55:24.029
[Jeff] Let's go, everybody. Let's go.
Gotta lock down.

55:24.112 --> 55:27.240
Hey, you can't stay there.
It's not safe. Come on.

55:31.578 --> 55:33.121
[line ringing]

55:36.082 --> 55:38.960
[voicemail] G'day. You've reached
Jeff from Fullerton Airways.

55:43.214 --> 55:44.799
[horns honking]

56:00.857 --> 56:03.651
[voicemail] G'day. You've reached Jeff
from Fullerton Airways.

56:05.445 --> 56:06.821
Just keep trying.

56:25.423 --> 56:28.134
Nik, go grab what we need and get inside.

56:28.218 --> 56:31.471
-[Nikki] What are you gonna do?
-I'm gonna go and find Dad.

56:32.263 --> 56:33.807
[Nikki] Just be careful, okay?

56:38.853 --> 56:40.230
[Dana] I'm coming, Dad.

56:40.772 --> 56:43.441
Dana, hey, what can I do?

56:43.525 --> 56:47.445
Step one, don't talk to me.
Beyond that, I don't care.

56:53.118 --> 56:55.453
[shouts] Dad? Dad?

56:55.537 --> 56:57.288
[thunder rumbling]

57:13.596 --> 57:15.098
[groaning]

57:20.562 --> 57:21.521
Dad?

57:25.108 --> 57:25.984
Dad!

57:33.158 --> 57:34.534
[grunting]

57:41.249 --> 57:43.251
Dad? You in here?

57:50.008 --> 57:51.885
Dad? Can you hear me?

57:53.636 --> 57:54.554
Dad!

57:56.723 --> 57:58.057
Dana!

57:59.601 --> 58:00.477
Dad.

58:02.228 --> 58:03.521
Dana!

58:06.524 --> 58:07.775
[Dana] Dad!

58:13.198 --> 58:14.282
Dana!

58:24.459 --> 58:26.377
-You okay?
-[groans in pain]

58:32.634 --> 58:33.635
Dad.

58:46.105 --> 58:47.190
Slowly, slowly.

58:57.158 --> 59:00.328
That's it. Just go slowly, Jeff.
Don't put pressure on it.

59:01.120 --> 59:01.955
All right?

59:03.081 --> 59:04.874
-Okay?
-[Nikki] Help us move this.

59:04.958 --> 59:06.751
-Here, here. Push.
-[Nikki straining]

59:09.087 --> 59:10.213
[all panting]

59:14.092 --> 59:15.260
Thanks.

59:16.010 --> 59:16.970
You're welcome.

59:17.804 --> 59:19.305
Now, where were we?

59:19.389 --> 59:21.683
Oh, yeah. Go to hell.

59:22.350 --> 59:25.144
Whoa. [hesitates] What's that all about?

59:25.228 --> 59:26.896
Oh. Oh, did you not tell him, Will?

59:26.980 --> 59:29.315
-Why don't you, uh, let Jeff know?
-Look, I'm--

59:29.399 --> 59:32.193
ITCM Financial are shutting us down.

59:32.277 --> 59:33.611
What? [straining]

59:33.695 --> 59:34.654
No, Jeff.

59:34.737 --> 59:37.240
Jeff, just relax.
Look, I'll explain. Okay? I'll explain.

59:37.323 --> 59:39.576
You came all this way
just to stab us in the back?

59:39.659 --> 59:40.910
That's exactly what I said.

59:40.994 --> 59:43.121
I'm sorry. All right? I'm sorry.

59:43.830 --> 59:45.999
-I should have said something.
-You think?

59:46.624 --> 59:49.586
The minute I get back to London,
I'll recommend to the board

59:49.669 --> 59:52.338
that we keep Fullerton Airways
open and operational.

59:53.923 --> 59:57.510
Dana, please believe me
when I say that I care about this place.

59:58.052 --> 59:59.929
-Give me a break.
-I mean it.

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:02.390
[Dana] You must think
we were born yesterday.

01:00:02.473 --> 01:00:04.434
People like you
don't give a damn about us.

01:00:04.517 --> 01:00:08.146
I mean, why would a rich kid,
heir of a multimillion dollar empire,

01:00:08.229 --> 01:00:09.981
care about a place like this?

01:00:10.064 --> 01:00:11.065
Because of you!

01:00:17.905 --> 01:00:19.240
Because I care about you.

01:00:24.621 --> 01:00:25.913
I care about you.

01:00:29.626 --> 01:00:30.835
[electricity crackling]

01:00:32.003 --> 01:00:33.671
It was just getting to the good bit.

01:00:34.422 --> 01:00:37.925
I'll find some light. There's a lantern
here somewhere. Oh, here we go.

01:00:47.727 --> 01:00:48.728
Look, um…

01:00:52.565 --> 01:00:53.524
You don't…

01:00:54.359 --> 01:00:56.778
-You don't need to say anything.
-[William] Dana…

01:01:04.577 --> 01:01:09.332
I thought I always knew
where I was going to end up, you know?

01:01:10.792 --> 01:01:12.794
But coming here…

01:01:14.420 --> 01:01:16.255
and meeting you,

01:01:17.215 --> 01:01:18.841
meeting all of you…

01:01:21.386 --> 01:01:23.805
You don't know what it's like
where I come from.

01:01:23.888 --> 01:01:25.348
Everybody's out for their cut.

01:01:26.224 --> 01:01:27.892
But you actually care.

01:01:29.727 --> 01:01:31.437
You care about people.

01:01:32.438 --> 01:01:36.150
You care about protecting
the things that are important to you.

01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:40.405
I don't think you realize
how rare that is.

01:01:48.162 --> 01:01:51.499
A week ago, this is the last place
on earth I wanted to be.

01:01:57.338 --> 01:01:58.756
Now I don't want to leave.

01:02:01.759 --> 01:02:05.263
I promise I am going to fix this.

01:02:08.099 --> 01:02:09.350
I swear.

01:02:18.484 --> 01:02:20.319
Isn't this a dog's breakfast.

01:02:22.530 --> 01:02:23.948
[thunder clap]

01:02:24.031 --> 01:02:25.825
[glass breaking]

01:02:25.908 --> 01:02:27.952
What are we looking at here?
What's the damage?

01:02:28.035 --> 01:02:31.247
Category 3… Geez.

01:02:32.039 --> 01:02:35.126
Wind's 250, 280 K per hour.

01:02:36.836 --> 01:02:40.840
There might not be a Fullerton Airways
left to save if it goes on like this.

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:43.760
There's gonna be a lot of people
out there who need help.

01:02:48.681 --> 01:02:50.224
[crashing]

01:03:08.618 --> 01:03:09.535
[Dana] Hey.

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:15.166
Hey. [clears throat] Hey.

01:03:17.126 --> 01:03:18.044
It's over.

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:20.379
Right.

01:03:22.381 --> 01:03:23.424
[exhales]

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:50.910
[Jeff] Bloody hell.

01:03:54.121 --> 01:03:55.456
I'll go and get the genny.

01:03:56.249 --> 01:03:58.417
Okay. I'm gonna do checks on Harriet.

01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:01.546
All right, I'm gonna see
if I can fire up the radio.

01:04:09.595 --> 01:04:10.888
Oh, Jesus.

01:04:28.990 --> 01:04:32.702
-[radio feedback]
-[Nikki] Uh, testing, testing.

01:04:32.785 --> 01:04:34.662
Fullerton Airways radio check.

01:04:36.747 --> 01:04:39.959
Fullerton Airways radio check.
Fullerton Airways radio check.

01:04:51.053 --> 01:04:53.389
Harriet's fine.
There's no damage that I can see.

01:04:53.472 --> 01:04:54.724
At least there's that.

01:04:54.807 --> 01:04:57.894
-No signal from here.
-Yeah, I wouldn't hold my breath.

01:04:59.645 --> 01:05:01.522
You're lucky that I'm so diddly.

01:05:03.024 --> 01:05:05.484
[man on radio] Mayday, mayday.
Calling anyone out there.

01:05:05.568 --> 01:05:08.863
This is the Bloomfield General Store.
We require immediate help.

01:05:08.946 --> 01:05:12.450
[officer] Come in. I repeat,
this is the Packers Bay Police Department.

01:05:12.533 --> 01:05:13.451
We are requesting…

01:05:13.534 --> 01:05:17.163
[woman] This is from the council.
We're in dire need of assistance.

01:05:17.246 --> 01:05:21.292
All right. There are people out there
who need our help. I'll man the radio.

01:05:21.375 --> 01:05:23.878
Nikki, you start getting
supply packages together.

01:05:23.961 --> 01:05:24.795
Yep.

01:05:24.879 --> 01:05:27.131
Dana and William,
get that plane in the air.

01:05:33.638 --> 01:05:35.514
Well, we haven't got all day!

01:06:19.517 --> 01:06:20.935
[Dana] Hey. Snap out of it.

01:06:21.018 --> 01:06:23.020
Take these over
to Simon in the medical tent.

01:06:23.104 --> 01:06:25.606
We'll drop off the rest
and fly some folks to the hospital.

01:06:25.690 --> 01:06:27.775
-[William] Yeah.
-Come on, this way.

01:06:50.214 --> 01:06:52.550
Right, we still got
some more space here, mate.

01:06:52.633 --> 01:06:54.343
[man] This is the last
of the apple boxes.

01:06:54.427 --> 01:06:58.180
[Jeff] Uh, Chilli Beach,
supplies on the way. ETA 15:40.

01:06:58.264 --> 01:07:00.307
There's medical, food, water.

01:07:00.391 --> 01:07:02.810
Threw in a bottle of Scotch
in there for you, Steve.

01:07:02.893 --> 01:07:04.645
Thought you might need it. Over.

01:07:08.149 --> 01:07:09.233
Roger, Packers Bay.

01:07:09.316 --> 01:07:12.778
Supplies on the way.
There's medical, food, water, blankets.

01:07:42.850 --> 01:07:44.852
[Dana] All right, you guys have that.

01:07:49.857 --> 01:07:51.776
-Hey. You're looking better.
-[man] Yeah.

01:07:51.859 --> 01:07:53.861
-Hey.
-Please. Here, have this…

01:07:53.944 --> 01:07:55.905
[Dana] No, yeah, that's fine. Keep it.

01:08:00.493 --> 01:08:01.660
You know, you, um…

01:08:04.038 --> 01:08:06.082
-You were amazing today.
-[chuckles]

01:08:07.708 --> 01:08:09.085
No, I mean it.

01:08:11.879 --> 01:08:13.130
Today was a team effort.

01:08:16.217 --> 01:08:20.596
Yeah, I'd rather think I was more there
for emotional support.

01:08:22.306 --> 01:08:26.352
The only way we were able to do as much
as we did today was because of your help.

01:08:27.812 --> 01:08:29.688
Not everyone would jump in like that.

01:08:32.733 --> 01:08:33.943
I've got to admit it.

01:08:35.903 --> 01:08:38.614
Having a flying partner
these last few days, well,

01:08:40.032 --> 01:08:41.158
hasn't been so bad.

01:08:44.453 --> 01:08:46.247
So, thanks.

01:08:50.251 --> 01:08:52.002
[people cheering, laughing]

01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:54.171
After everything
these people have been through,

01:08:54.255 --> 01:08:56.048
they still manage to muster a smile.

01:08:56.132 --> 01:09:00.219
[Dana] Well, I guess that's a part
of what makes this place so special.

01:09:04.014 --> 01:09:06.725
Oh. [chuckles]

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:09.145
[William] I completely forgot
I had this on me.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.690
I guess you're gonna
want to get that dry cleaned.

01:09:17.236 --> 01:09:18.112
Or not.

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:20.489
-Wait. How much did that cost?
-A lot.

01:09:20.573 --> 01:09:21.657
Yeah. Right.

01:09:22.199 --> 01:09:23.450
[William chuckles]

01:09:29.874 --> 01:09:31.292
To Fullerton Airways.

01:09:33.294 --> 01:09:34.628
To Fullerton Airways.

01:10:04.325 --> 01:10:06.243
You know, without the tie,

01:10:07.244 --> 01:10:09.455
you kind of look like
you could fit in here.

01:10:13.125 --> 01:10:14.335
Just maybe.

01:10:20.758 --> 01:10:23.594
-I hate to interrupt, but…
-Hello, Dad.

01:10:24.762 --> 01:10:28.724
I've just had an e-mail
from ITCM Financial.

01:10:31.393 --> 01:10:32.519
And?

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:37.608
Well, they've informed me that
we're shut down. Effective immediately.

01:10:39.985 --> 01:10:40.819
[sighs]

01:10:42.112 --> 01:10:44.031
-They're…
-Dad.

01:10:44.698 --> 01:10:46.533
They're splitting us up for parts.

01:10:50.204 --> 01:10:55.501
Will, if you're gonna do something,
now would be a really good time.

01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:00.881
Right.

01:11:03.801 --> 01:11:05.010
[line ringing]

01:11:05.552 --> 01:11:07.388
[Mary] Hello. Duncan Mitchell's office.

01:11:07.471 --> 01:11:11.225
Mary, it's Will. William.
Can you, um, put my father on, please?

01:11:11.308 --> 01:11:12.977
I'm sorry. Mr. Mitchell's in a meeting.

01:11:13.060 --> 01:11:16.605
Mary, can you go and get my father now?
Please, it's an emergency.

01:11:17.147 --> 01:11:18.232
Just a moment.

01:11:20.401 --> 01:11:22.611
William, this had better be
damned important.

01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:25.114
Dad, don't sell Fullerton Airways.

01:11:25.197 --> 01:11:26.991
All right? Please don't do this.

01:11:27.074 --> 01:11:28.409
Are you serious?

01:11:29.034 --> 01:11:30.703
Scrapping that two-bit airline

01:11:30.786 --> 01:11:33.414
is about the only bright side
of this debacle.

01:11:33.497 --> 01:11:35.541
I can find the money somewhere else.

01:11:35.624 --> 01:11:38.168
All right? Just give me… Give me time.

01:11:38.252 --> 01:11:41.422
The board has been briefed.
I did your job for you.

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:43.007
It's done.

01:11:43.716 --> 01:11:46.802
Dad, there's… There's value here.
All right?

01:11:47.594 --> 01:11:49.471
What was the point of me
coming all this way?

01:11:50.639 --> 01:11:56.520
The point of the venture was to prove
to the company that you were ready.

01:11:57.438 --> 01:11:58.897
Ready to take the next step.

01:11:58.981 --> 01:12:01.859
Ready for real responsibility.
I believed that you were--

01:12:01.942 --> 01:12:04.194
Dad, you're not listening
to what I'm saying.

01:12:04.278 --> 01:12:06.238
We'll talk more when you get back.

01:12:13.287 --> 01:12:15.331
-No, Dana--
-Best to let her go, mate.

01:12:16.874 --> 01:12:18.042
[sighs]

01:12:22.421 --> 01:12:25.507
Jeff, I'm so sorry.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:30.054
Yeah, I know, son.
You did your best, but, uh,

01:12:31.638 --> 01:12:36.060
fathers can be… stubborn sometimes.

01:12:37.436 --> 01:12:40.564
Mary, no further calls.

01:12:46.987 --> 01:12:48.447
You take care of yourself.

01:12:51.492 --> 01:12:54.703
Jeff… look, if there's anything
I can do…

01:12:57.790 --> 01:13:00.793
Uh, keep working on that spin ball.

01:13:02.294 --> 01:13:05.964
Stay, uh, above the batter's eyeline.

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:08.342
Okay? [chuckles]

01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:12.429
-Okay?
-All right.

01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:17.768
I'll see you around, mate.

01:14:07.985 --> 01:14:10.237
[Jeff] She would have been
proud of you, you know?

01:14:12.573 --> 01:14:14.116
I don't know about that.

01:14:14.199 --> 01:14:17.578
Haven't exactly done the best job
in keeping this place going.

01:14:19.037 --> 01:14:21.039
You know your mother's saying,

01:14:21.123 --> 01:14:23.542
"If you want something done,
you do it yourself."

01:14:26.253 --> 01:14:28.797
Well, that's about having
the strength to stand up

01:14:28.881 --> 01:14:30.966
when you see something that needs doing.

01:14:32.301 --> 01:14:33.552
It's about taking action.

01:14:37.556 --> 01:14:41.226
But that doesn't mean that it's your job
to fix everything by yourself.

01:14:45.272 --> 01:14:47.816
-Oh, she loved this place.
-Yeah.

01:14:49.276 --> 01:14:54.364
But the last thing she would have wanted
was for it to become a burden for you.

01:14:57.242 --> 01:14:58.243
What she wanted

01:14:59.203 --> 01:15:03.957
more than anything else
was for you to be happy.

01:15:08.962 --> 01:15:10.005
Yeah.

01:15:13.717 --> 01:15:16.678
-I really miss her, Dad. [sniffles]
-I know, sweetheart.

01:15:22.309 --> 01:15:23.310
So do I.

01:15:45.249 --> 01:15:48.418
[Nikki] Oh, man, ITCM's gonna

01:15:48.502 --> 01:15:51.338
have a hell of a hard time
trying to sell this old girl.

01:15:51.421 --> 01:15:54.091
Think I could just
chuck 20 bucks and keep it?

01:15:54.174 --> 01:15:59.221
To hell with that.
You keep it, love. Give it a good home.

01:16:00.347 --> 01:16:04.184
You know she's just gonna disassemble it
for parts within ten minutes, right?

01:16:04.268 --> 01:16:09.189
Still, better than lining the pockets
of those greedy bastards across the pond.

01:16:21.159 --> 01:16:25.122
[Nikki] Oh, no. [in British accent]
Mr. Darcy's tablet is broken.

01:16:25.205 --> 01:16:27.541
Perhaps he'll have to ask Papa
for a new one.

01:16:27.624 --> 01:16:28.625
Yeah.

01:16:29.751 --> 01:16:32.212
I'm being a bit harsh on him, you reckon?

01:16:32.296 --> 01:16:34.631
[Dana] Doesn't matter. The damage is done.

01:16:34.715 --> 01:16:35.924
I think he meant well.

01:16:37.175 --> 01:16:39.678
I just feel like surely he knows some way

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:43.223
to sweeten the deal with his old man,
you know? Surely.

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:48.645
If my dad had
a private equity firm… [exclaims]

01:16:48.729 --> 01:16:51.648
Tell you what,
there'd be no more duct tape engineering.

01:16:51.732 --> 01:16:54.693
It'd all be world class, baby.
Just state of the art.

01:16:56.862 --> 01:16:59.698
-Wait. What'd you say?
-State of the art?

01:17:02.492 --> 01:17:03.577
That's it.

01:17:04.161 --> 01:17:06.163
Yeah. Tell me about it.

01:17:06.246 --> 01:17:08.665
No, I mean it. That's it.

01:17:09.541 --> 01:17:11.043
No, you've lost me completely.

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:14.588
Dad, I have an idea. Hear me out.

01:17:18.258 --> 01:17:19.718
Sure you're okay to go alone?

01:17:19.801 --> 01:17:21.219
Don't worry, I'll be fine.

01:17:21.303 --> 01:17:23.680
Just keep everything together
until I get back.

01:17:24.473 --> 01:17:27.851
Oh, and do me a favor. Radio ahead,
get me a place to set down in Brissy.

01:17:27.934 --> 01:17:29.936
Need to keep the old girl
around for a few days.

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:34.775
All right. You got it.
And, D, your mom would be so proud.

01:17:37.444 --> 01:17:39.529
You really think this is gonna work?

01:17:40.238 --> 01:17:41.239
It's our only shot.

01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:01.802
[woman] Ladies and gentlemen,

01:18:01.885 --> 01:18:04.846
please remain seated
with your seatbelts fastened.

01:18:10.394 --> 01:18:13.480
[Duncan] Thank you, Marcus.
Now, for our final order of business,

01:18:13.563 --> 01:18:16.483
I'd like to discuss
a particularly noteworthy development

01:18:16.566 --> 01:18:20.070
from the lab team over at ESA.
Mary, would you please show--

01:18:20.153 --> 01:18:22.656
[Mary] I'm sorry, sir.
I'm afraid there's someone--

01:18:22.739 --> 01:18:24.199
-[woman] Excuse me?
-G'day.

01:18:25.701 --> 01:18:27.744
-Hi, Will.
-Dana.

01:18:28.453 --> 01:18:29.496
I'm sorry, who are you?

01:18:31.665 --> 01:18:32.874
What are you doing here?

01:18:34.418 --> 01:18:36.086
I didn't think I'd ever see you again.

01:18:36.169 --> 01:18:38.130
Well, I need to speak to your old man.

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:41.216
William, what is the meaning of this?
Who is this woman?

01:18:41.299 --> 01:18:43.051
Mr. Mitchell. Hi.

01:18:43.135 --> 01:18:45.929
Uh, ladies and gentlemen of the board…

01:18:47.973 --> 01:18:50.434
Yep. Well, my name is Dana Randall.

01:18:50.517 --> 01:18:55.313
I'm the chief pilot at Fullerton Airways,
a small Australian airline,

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:57.190
which you terminated a few days ago.

01:18:58.233 --> 01:18:59.443
William, sit down.

01:19:00.652 --> 01:19:01.862
Yeah.

01:19:01.945 --> 01:19:04.156
[Duncan] Miss Randall,
this is highly irregular.

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:06.616
-You'll need to leave.
-If you give me five minutes--

01:19:06.700 --> 01:19:08.326
-Mary, will you please call--
-Dad, Dad.

01:19:10.036 --> 01:19:11.705
Let's hear her out.

01:19:15.208 --> 01:19:16.460
Two minutes.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:19.171
[mouthing]

01:19:19.254 --> 01:19:20.797
This had better be good.

01:19:20.881 --> 01:19:24.176
Well, Fullerton Airways
is a tiny operation

01:19:24.259 --> 01:19:25.677
on the other side of the world.

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:27.846
But what you won't believe

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:30.390
is that we actually have
something in common.

01:19:30.474 --> 01:19:33.351
You see, we're both family businesses.

01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:36.688
My mum and dad started ours
when I was little and,

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:39.858
well, I promised myself
that I would always protect it,

01:19:39.941 --> 01:19:42.861
always keep it
just the way that they made it.

01:19:43.570 --> 01:19:45.447
The way that I always remembered it.

01:19:45.989 --> 01:19:49.075
You know what happened? I killed it.

01:19:49.159 --> 01:19:50.702
I think it might be better--

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:53.997
I killed it because
I didn't want anything to change.

01:19:54.790 --> 01:19:58.126
You know, and sometimes
we do need to accept

01:19:58.210 --> 01:20:01.922
that the best way forward
is to chart a different course.

01:20:07.969 --> 01:20:11.473
Look I came here today with a proposal.

01:20:11.556 --> 01:20:13.558
We cannot stand still any longer.

01:20:13.642 --> 01:20:17.687
The only way for Fullerton Airways
to survive is to expand.

01:20:17.771 --> 01:20:21.191
We need to bring in
more pilots, more planes.

01:20:21.274 --> 01:20:24.194
Here you go. This is yours.
It's time to take the next step.

01:20:24.277 --> 01:20:28.782
In order to do that, we are going to need
a new injection of capital.

01:20:28.865 --> 01:20:32.327
Now, with your support,
we'll be able to increase the coverage,

01:20:32.410 --> 01:20:35.413
almost triple the output within two years.

01:20:35.497 --> 01:20:37.374
We can take Fullerton Airways

01:20:37.457 --> 01:20:41.211
from a struggling family operation
to a thriving business,

01:20:41.837 --> 01:20:46.716
one that continues to serve the community
in meaningful and essential ways.

01:20:51.012 --> 01:20:53.014
So, I mean, what do you think?

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:57.519
I think this has gone on long enough.

01:21:00.397 --> 01:21:04.818
Miss Randall, this is absurd.
I'm familiar with your situation.

01:21:04.901 --> 01:21:09.114
Do you honestly expect us
to throw more money into this disaster?

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:12.534
There's no indication you'll be able
to manage something like this.

01:21:13.285 --> 01:21:16.121
What if they had a more
experienced financial officer?

01:21:19.374 --> 01:21:20.667
What?

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:23.128
Dad…

01:21:25.171 --> 01:21:28.550
I'm resigning. Effective immediately.

01:21:29.593 --> 01:21:33.430
I, uh… I'm gonna go
and work for Fullerton Airways.

01:21:35.056 --> 01:21:36.099
If they'll have me.

01:21:40.312 --> 01:21:41.396
You must be joking.

01:21:41.479 --> 01:21:42.772
No, I'm… I'm not.

01:21:45.150 --> 01:21:48.069
But if you give me a chance
to get this business on their feet,

01:21:48.153 --> 01:21:50.113
I will show you that they do have legs.

01:21:51.656 --> 01:21:52.908
Don't be ridiculous.

01:21:54.284 --> 01:21:58.038
I mean, why in heaven's name
would you want to throw away a career?

01:21:58.121 --> 01:22:02.584
Dad, you built this business.
This was your dream.

01:22:03.877 --> 01:22:05.879
Don't you remember how that felt?

01:22:05.962 --> 01:22:09.257
To believe in something so badly
that you had to see it done?

01:22:15.472 --> 01:22:16.306
But, William--

01:22:16.389 --> 01:22:21.269
Look, I… I only came here
because I wanted to make you proud.

01:22:22.938 --> 01:22:24.397
I still want that.

01:22:25.315 --> 01:22:28.944
But I… I don't belong here.

01:22:32.364 --> 01:22:34.699
I'm just asking you to trust me.

01:22:35.533 --> 01:22:36.618
Trust us.

01:22:40.747 --> 01:22:41.748
Please.

01:22:49.798 --> 01:22:51.466
You really think you can do this?

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:56.012
We can.

01:23:00.684 --> 01:23:01.685
Together.

01:23:15.949 --> 01:23:17.617
[phone beeps]

01:23:17.701 --> 01:23:19.703
-Mary.
-Yes, sir?

01:23:25.083 --> 01:23:28.211
Send in Simon and the legal team.
We have a proposal to review.

01:23:33.174 --> 01:23:34.175
Shall we?

01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:47.439
You sure about this?
I mean, it's not going to be easy.

01:23:47.522 --> 01:23:49.899
Well, are you sure you want
to have a flying partner?

01:23:51.276 --> 01:23:52.527
Something like that.

01:24:19.387 --> 01:24:21.181
[inaudible conversation]
