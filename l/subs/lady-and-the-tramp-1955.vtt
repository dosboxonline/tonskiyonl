00:19.728 --> 00:23.232
<i>This is the night</i>

00:23.398 --> 00:26.902
<i>It's a beautiful night</i>

00:27.069 --> 00:33.076
<i>And they call it bella notte</i>

00:34.201 --> 00:37.171
<i>Look at the skies</i>

00:37.329 --> 00:41.050
<i>They have stars in their eyes</i>

00:41.208 --> 00:47.341
<i>On this lovely bella notte</i>

00:47.923 --> 00:51.052
<i>So take the love</i>

00:51.218 --> 00:54.563
<i>Of your loved one</i>

00:54.721 --> 01:00.603
<i>You'll need it about this time</i>

01:01.395 --> 01:07.027
<i>To keep from falling like a star</i>

01:07.192 --> 01:11.242
<i>When you make that dizzy climb</i>

01:11.405 --> 01:16.912
<i>For this is the night</i>

01:17.077 --> 01:22.208
<i>And the heavens are right</i>

01:22.833 --> 01:25.803
<i>On this lovely</i>

01:25.961 --> 01:30.842
<i>Bella notte</i>

01:32.634 --> 01:35.353
<i>On this lovely</i>

01:35.512 --> 01:41.690
<i>Bella notte</i>

02:05.292 --> 02:10.344
<i>Silent as a snowï¬‚ake in the night</i>

02:10.505 --> 02:15.136
<i>Holy is the spirit of this night</i>

02:15.302 --> 02:20.103
<i>All the world is calm and peaceful</i>

02:20.265 --> 02:24.941
<i>All the world is bright and joyful</i>

02:25.103 --> 02:29.074
<i>Spirit of love</i>

02:29.232 --> 02:34.864
<i>And child of peace</i>

02:35.155 --> 02:39.410
<i>Love unending</i>

02:39.576 --> 02:45.254
<i>That shall not cease</i>

02:45.415 --> 02:50.592
<i>Peace, my children</i>

02:50.754 --> 02:55.601
<i>Of good will</i>

02:56.301 --> 02:58.520
<i>Peace, my children</i>

02:58.679 --> 03:04.686
<i>Peace, be still</i>

03:07.896 --> 03:09.239
It's for you, darling.

03:09.398 --> 03:10.741
Merry Christmas.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.776
Oh, Jim, dear.

03:12.943 --> 03:15.162
It's the one I was admiring, isn't it?

03:15.320 --> 03:17.197
Trimmed with ribbons?

03:17.364 --> 03:20.914
Well, it has a ribbon.

03:22.703 --> 03:25.832
Oh, how sweet.

03:25.997 --> 03:28.500
- You like her, darling?
- Oh, I love her.

03:32.504 --> 03:35.633
What a perfectly beautiful little lady.

03:46.351 --> 03:48.479
Come on, Lady. Over here.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.149
That's a girl.

03:53.859 --> 03:57.489
There, now.
A nice little bed for you.

03:57.654 --> 04:00.783
But Jim, dear, are you sure
she'll be warm enough?

04:00.949 --> 04:04.169
Why, of course, darling.
She'll be snug as a bug in a...

04:05.454 --> 04:07.252
Almost forgot something.

04:08.373 --> 04:10.250
There.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.669
Good night, Lady.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.508
Now, now, don't worry, darling.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.422
She'll go right to sleep.

04:17.673 --> 04:19.017
No, no, Lady.

04:21.386 --> 04:24.936
This is where you belong, right here.

04:42.949 --> 04:45.873
Aw, look. She's lonesome.

04:46.036 --> 04:48.960
Don't you think maybe...?
Just for tonight?

04:49.122 --> 04:52.001
Now, darling, if we're going
to show her who's master,

04:52.167 --> 04:54.295
we must be firm
from the very beginning.

05:30.038 --> 05:31.381
Lady!

05:31.540 --> 05:32.712
Stop that now!

05:32.874 --> 05:34.296
Stop it!

05:52.269 --> 05:55.523
Lady! Quiet, now. You hear me?

05:55.689 --> 05:57.282
Back to bed!

05:57.774 --> 05:59.196
Quick, now.

06:00.485 --> 06:02.783
Not one more sound.

07:00.378 --> 07:01.550
Jim, dear.

07:09.262 --> 07:10.809
Aw, Jim.

07:10.972 --> 07:12.189
What?

07:19.981 --> 07:21.824
Oh, all right.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.703
But remember, just for tonight.

08:07.821 --> 08:10.165
All right, Lady. All right.

08:10.323 --> 08:13.042
I'm up. I'm up, Lady. I...

08:13.201 --> 08:15.545
Oh, no!

08:15.704 --> 08:17.297
What's wrong, Jim? What is it?

08:17.455 --> 08:20.254
Can't you explain to Lady about Sundays?

09:32.614 --> 09:35.584
Have you noticed, darling,
since we've had Lady,

09:35.742 --> 09:39.417
we see less and less
of those disturbing headlines?

09:39.579 --> 09:43.675
Yes, I just don't know
how we ever got along without her.

09:44.417 --> 09:47.296
Say, she must be about six months old.

09:47.462 --> 09:49.385
We'd better be getting her a license.

10:04.479 --> 10:05.901
Hope it fits.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.610
My, but it does look nice.

10:09.776 --> 10:11.073
So grown up.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.864
Won't Jock and Trusty be surprised?

10:29.921 --> 10:33.095
<i>Four steps straight
and then to the left</i>

10:33.258 --> 10:37.013
<i>And right to the place
where I marked it</i>

10:37.178 --> 10:41.058
<i>With a bonnie, bonnie bone
that I buried for me own</i>

10:41.224 --> 10:45.229
<i>In my bonnie, bonnie bank
in the backyard</i>

10:46.729 --> 10:48.982
That's a grand sight.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.275
Jock!

10:52.152 --> 10:53.995
Oh, Jock!

10:59.826 --> 11:01.453
Hello, Jock.

11:01.619 --> 11:04.418
Oh! Oh, it's you, lassie.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.549
Notice anything different?

11:07.834 --> 11:09.757
You've had a bath?

11:09.919 --> 11:11.421
No, not that.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.761
You've had your nails clipped?

11:15.133 --> 11:16.885
Guess again.

11:17.343 --> 11:20.813
Well, I wouldn't a-be a-knowin'.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.610
Why, lassie.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.645
A bonnie new collar.

11:27.812 --> 11:30.031
- Do you like it?
- Aye.

11:31.900 --> 11:34.278
It must be very expensive.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.497
- Have you shown it to Trusty yet?
- No.

11:37.655 --> 11:40.204
We'd best go at once.

11:40.366 --> 11:43.620
You know how sensitive
he is about these things.

12:03.806 --> 12:05.524
He's dreaming.

12:05.683 --> 12:06.775
Aye.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.188
Dreamin' of those bonnie bygone days

12:09.354 --> 12:12.483
when he and his grandfather
were trackin' criminals

12:12.649 --> 12:14.151
through the swamps.

12:14.317 --> 12:17.161
- They were?
- But that was before...

12:18.196 --> 12:19.743
Before what?

12:20.323 --> 12:23.293
'Tis time you knew the truth, lassie.

12:23.451 --> 12:26.079
It shouldn't have happened to a dog.

12:26.246 --> 12:28.795
<i>But, well...</i>

12:28.957 --> 12:31.881
Trusty has lost his sense of smell.

12:33.211 --> 12:34.804
<i>' No!
' Aye.</i>

12:35.505 --> 12:38.258
But we must never let on
that we know, lassie.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.229
It would break his poor heart

12:50.186 --> 12:52.985
Which way did he go?
Which way did he go?

12:53.147 --> 12:56.071
- Go?
- Yeah, big fella.

12:56.234 --> 12:57.986
About six-foot-two.

12:59.028 --> 13:00.450
No, three.

13:00.613 --> 13:03.366
Wore a striped suit. No collar.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.667
Why, Miss Lady.

13:07.829 --> 13:10.002
You have a collar.

13:11.332 --> 13:12.549
And a license.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.507
<i>My, my.</i>

13:14.669 --> 13:17.843
- How time does fly.
- Aye.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.384
It seems only yesterday
she was cuttin' her teeth

13:20.550 --> 13:22.268
on Jim Dear's slippers,

13:22.427 --> 13:26.523
and now there she is, a full-grown lady.

13:26.681 --> 13:31.152
Wearin' the greatest honor
man can bestow.

13:31.311 --> 13:33.780
The badge of faith and respectability.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.693
That's right, Miss Lady.

13:37.859 --> 13:41.864
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...

13:42.030 --> 13:45.534
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.

13:45.700 --> 13:47.953
Aye, you have, laddie.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.962
Oh, yeah.

13:51.372 --> 13:52.999
It's Jim Dear.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.422
Please excuse me.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.924
Hello, there, Lady.

14:01.674 --> 14:03.517
Come on, beat you home.

14:10.058 --> 14:11.731
You win again.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.110
Steady, now.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.021
Steady.

14:15.563 --> 14:17.315
Well, what have we here?

14:18.816 --> 14:20.193
Big girl now, huh?

14:20.360 --> 14:21.361
All right.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.114
Ladies first.

14:30.078 --> 14:31.955
You know, darling, with Lady here,

14:32.121 --> 14:34.749
I'd say life is quite complete.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.088
Yes, dear.

14:36.250 --> 14:40.005
I don't imagine anything could
ever take her place in our hearts.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.759
What a day!

15:26.926 --> 15:30.055
Well, now to dig up some breakfast.

15:42.984 --> 15:45.328
Cute little rascals.

15:50.575 --> 15:53.670
Now. That breakfast, let's see.

15:54.412 --> 15:55.538
Bernie's?

15:57.165 --> 15:59.759
No. Francois...

15:59.917 --> 16:01.214
No, no.

16:01.377 --> 16:03.004
Nope. Too much starch.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.890
Tony's. Oh, that's it.

16:07.091 --> 16:08.718
I haven't been there in a week.

16:10.094 --> 16:12.768
<i>A beautiful day to make pizza</i>

16:12.930 --> 16:17.106
<i>Hey, still we call it bella notte</i>

16:18.936 --> 16:21.940
Well, buon giorno, Butch.

16:22.106 --> 16:24.484
You want-a your breakfast?

16:24.650 --> 16:28.621
OK. The boss, he's a-saving
some a-nice bones for you.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.166
Breakfast comin' up from a-left field.

16:33.367 --> 16:34.789
Good catch!

16:41.042 --> 16:42.669
Whoa, boy, whoa.

17:18.746 --> 17:19.747
Hey.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.050
Blimey.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.429
Look, Peg, it's the tramp.

17:27.338 --> 17:30.182
Hiya, handsome.
Come to join the party?

17:30.341 --> 17:32.469
All right, all right.
No time for wisecracks.

17:32.635 --> 17:34.057
I've got to get you out.

17:34.220 --> 17:37.474
I'm telling you, the pressure's
really on. Signs all over town.

17:37.640 --> 17:41.361
- Gee, thanks.
- You're a bit of all right, chum.

17:41.519 --> 17:44.443
- OK, OK, get going.
- Hey! What's going on over there?

17:44.605 --> 17:47.449
Scram. And be careful.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.445
WW, you mangy mutt.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.613
Hey. Let go. Let go of me.

18:12.717 --> 18:15.345
Well. Snob hill!

18:19.056 --> 18:21.229
Hi, gals. How's pickings?

18:23.019 --> 18:24.771
Pretty slim?

18:24.937 --> 18:28.612
Yeah. I'll bet they've got
a lid on every trash can.

18:30.234 --> 18:32.578
And a fence around every tree.

18:34.780 --> 18:38.785
I wonder what the leash and collar set
does for excitement.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.964
Lassie. Lassie!

18:48.085 --> 18:51.339
Miss Lady, ma'am.

18:52.256 --> 18:56.011
Miss Lady!

18:56.177 --> 18:58.020
Good morning, lassie.

18:58.179 --> 19:00.602
'Tis a bonnie, braw, bright day...

19:01.557 --> 19:02.809
...day.

19:02.975 --> 19:05.228
Why, Miss Lady.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.192
Is something wrong?

19:07.355 --> 19:08.902
Aye. Tell us, lassie.

19:09.065 --> 19:12.319
- If somebody's been mistreatin' <i>ya...</i>
- No, Jock.

19:12.485 --> 19:15.364
It's something I've done, I guess.

19:15.529 --> 19:17.122
You?

19:17.281 --> 19:18.783
It must be.

19:18.949 --> 19:22.419
Jim Dear and Darling are acting <i>so...</i>

19:26.290 --> 19:30.591
- Jim Dear and Darling?
- Hush, lad.

19:39.679 --> 19:43.104
Now, lassie,
get on with the details.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.643
Well, I first noticed it

19:45.810 --> 19:48.529
the other day
when Jim Dear came home.

19:59.532 --> 20:00.704
Down, Lady, down!

20:05.830 --> 20:07.832
Darling, darling!

20:07.998 --> 20:09.420
Are you all right?

20:09.583 --> 20:12.086
Of course I am.
Why shouldn't I be?

20:17.675 --> 20:19.677
I just can't help worrying.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.687
After all, in your condition,

20:21.846 --> 20:23.098
alone here all day,

20:23.264 --> 20:25.437
and walking that dog...

20:26.225 --> 20:29.195
- That dog!
- That dog?

20:29.353 --> 20:31.856
He's never called me that before.

20:32.022 --> 20:33.820
Well, now, lassie,

20:33.983 --> 20:36.452
I wouldn't worry
my wee head about that.

20:36.610 --> 20:39.454
Remember,
they're only humans, after all.

20:39.613 --> 20:41.911
That's right, Miss Lady.

20:42.074 --> 20:46.079
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...

20:46.245 --> 20:49.875
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.135
Aye, you have, laddie.

20:53.294 --> 20:55.672
- Frequently.
- Yeah.

20:55.838 --> 20:58.512
But now Darling <i>is... Well...</i>

20:58.674 --> 21:02.019
We've always enjoyed
our afternoon romp together.

21:02.178 --> 21:03.430
But yesterday...

21:19.278 --> 21:22.282
No, Lady. No walk today.

21:32.666 --> 21:33.918
No, Lady.

21:34.668 --> 21:35.715
Not now.

21:37.797 --> 21:38.923
Lady!

21:39.507 --> 21:40.929
Drop that, Lady.

21:41.926 --> 21:43.599
Drop it, I say.

21:45.596 --> 21:47.815
It didn't hurt, really

21:47.973 --> 21:51.398
But Darling has never
struck me... before.

21:53.771 --> 21:55.148
Now, lassie.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.362
Do not take it too seriously.

21:57.525 --> 21:59.573
After all, at a time like this...

21:59.735 --> 22:03.035
Why, yes, you see, Miss Lady,

22:03.197 --> 22:07.623
there comes a time
in the life of all humans when...

22:08.410 --> 22:11.630
Well, as they put it...

22:11.789 --> 22:14.087
Birds and the bees?

22:14.250 --> 22:16.469
Or... Well...

22:16.627 --> 22:19.927
The stork? You know... No?

22:20.089 --> 22:23.059
- Well...
- What he's trying to say, lassie,

22:23.217 --> 22:26.767
is Darling is expecting a wee bairn.

22:26.929 --> 22:28.101
Bairn?

22:28.264 --> 22:31.143
He means a baby, Miss Lady.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.901
Oh.

22:33.686 --> 22:35.734
What's a baby?

22:35.896 --> 22:38.524
Well, they resemble humans.

22:38.691 --> 22:41.786
But I'd say a mite smaller.

22:41.944 --> 22:44.117
Aye. And they walk on all fours.

22:44.280 --> 22:48.376
And if I remember correctly,
they bellow a lot.

22:48.534 --> 22:51.162
Aye. And they're very expensive.

22:51.912 --> 22:53.664
You will not be permitted
to play with it.

22:53.831 --> 22:56.254
But they're mighty sweet.

22:56.417 --> 22:59.136
And very, very soft.

22:59.295 --> 23:01.514
Just a cute little bundle.

23:02.548 --> 23:03.640
Of trouble.

23:03.966 --> 23:06.469
Yeah. They scratch, pinch, pull ears...

23:07.261 --> 23:09.889
But shucks. Any dog can take that.

23:10.055 --> 23:12.149
It's what they do to your happy home.

23:12.308 --> 23:13.685
Move it over, will you, friend?

23:13.851 --> 23:15.569
Homewreckers, that's what they are.

23:15.728 --> 23:17.696
Look here.
Who are you to barge in?

23:17.855 --> 23:20.358
The voice of experience, buster.

23:21.775 --> 23:24.699
Just wait till junior gets here.

23:24.862 --> 23:27.411
You get the urge
for a nice comfortable scratch,

23:27.573 --> 23:29.826
and, "Put that dog out!

23:29.992 --> 23:31.994
He'll get fleas all over the baby."

23:32.661 --> 23:34.789
You start barking
at some strange mutt

23:36.874 --> 23:39.343
"Stop that racket.
You'll wake the baby."

23:40.002 --> 23:41.174
And then!

23:41.337 --> 23:44.591
Then they hit you in the room
and board department.

23:45.716 --> 23:48.811
Remember those nice,
juicy cuts of beef?

23:50.846 --> 23:52.439
<i>Forget them.</i>

23:52.598 --> 23:55.067
<i>Leftover baby food.</i>

23:55.225 --> 23:57.478
<i>And that nice,
warm bed by the fire?</i>

24:03.734 --> 24:05.782
<i>A leaky doghouse.</i>

24:05.945 --> 24:08.039
- Oh, dear.
- Do not listen, lassie.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.824
No human is that cruel.

24:09.990 --> 24:12.368
Of course not, Miss Lady.

24:12.534 --> 24:14.912
Why, everybody knows

24:15.079 --> 24:18.674
a dog's best friend is his human.

24:20.250 --> 24:22.048
Come on now, fellas.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.048
You haven't fallen
for that old line, now have you?

24:25.214 --> 24:28.093
Aye. And we've no need for mongrels

24:28.258 --> 24:30.386
and their radical ideas.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.179
Off with you, now. Off with you!

24:32.346 --> 24:33.848
- OK, Sandy.
- The name's Jock.

24:34.014 --> 24:36.267
- OK, Jock.
- Heather Lad of Glencairn to you!

24:36.433 --> 24:38.731
OK, OK, OK.

24:38.894 --> 24:40.567
But remember this, Pigeon.

24:40.729 --> 24:44.324
A human heart has only so much
room for love and affection.

24:44.775 --> 24:46.994
When a baby moves in,

24:47.152 --> 24:49.746
the dog moves out.

24:56.036 --> 24:59.085
Let's see. That'll be about...

25:00.582 --> 25:02.505
Oh, well.

25:09.133 --> 25:10.259
Darling?

25:11.093 --> 25:14.973
There isn't any way we can tell, for
sure, what it's going to be, is there?

25:15.139 --> 25:19.485
I'm afraid not.
Nobody ever knows for certain.

25:19.643 --> 25:22.317
All we can do is hope.

25:48.088 --> 25:51.809
Darling, are you sure
you want watermelon?

25:54.428 --> 25:56.021
And some chop suey too.

25:56.180 --> 25:58.729
Chop su...

25:58.891 --> 26:00.985
All right, darling.

26:11.862 --> 26:14.706
- That's the cutest thing I ever saw.
- What darling little booties!

26:14.865 --> 26:17.288
- That bonnet.
- Isn't it just too adorable?

26:17.451 --> 26:19.124
Don't you love showers?

26:19.286 --> 26:21.459
I've never seen you look more beautiful.

26:21.622 --> 26:22.965
Isn't she radiant?

26:23.123 --> 26:25.091
That's what I told Bill yesterday.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.594
"Darling looks positively radiant.

26:27.753 --> 26:31.348
Why, in all my days," I said,
"I've never seen anyone as radiant."

26:34.968 --> 26:36.390
Jim, you look terrible.

26:36.553 --> 26:38.146
Absolutely horrible.

26:38.305 --> 26:40.433
I never saw you look worse.

26:40.599 --> 26:45.196
Cheer up, Jim. Old Doc Jones
has never lost a father yet.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.992
Yes, Aunt Sarah, it's a boy.

26:58.700 --> 27:01.203
A boy. And... What's that?

27:01.995 --> 27:04.589
Eyes?
What color are they?

27:04.748 --> 27:06.000
Well, oh, gosh.

27:06.166 --> 27:07.793
I forgot to look.

27:09.211 --> 27:12.181
A boy. It's a boy, it's a... Doctor!

27:13.173 --> 27:15.175
Doctor, it's a boy!

27:15.342 --> 27:17.310
Yes, yes, I know.

27:17.469 --> 27:18.595
A boy.

27:18.762 --> 27:20.105
Oh, boy, oh, boy!

27:20.264 --> 27:22.232
It's a boy, it's a boy, it's a boy!

27:22.391 --> 27:24.268
<i>Hello? Hello, Jim?</i>

27:24.434 --> 27:25.856
<i>Are you there, Jim?</i>

27:26.019 --> 27:28.613
<i>Central, we've been cutoff.</i>

27:28.772 --> 27:30.115
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

27:30.274 --> 27:31.901
<i>Hello!</i>

28:01.346 --> 28:03.394
<i>What is a baby?</i>

28:04.266 --> 28:07.486
<i>I just can't understand</i>

28:08.896 --> 28:13.117
<i>It must be something wonderful</i>

28:13.275 --> 28:16.825
<i>It must be something grand</i>

28:18.071 --> 28:21.871
<i>'Cause everybody's smiling</i>

28:22.034 --> 28:26.460
<i>In a kind and wistful way</i>

28:26.622 --> 28:30.968
<i>And they haven't even noticed</i>

28:31.126 --> 28:34.881
<i>That I'm around today</i>

28:46.683 --> 28:49.061
<i>What is a baby, anyway?</i>

28:52.189 --> 28:54.988
<i>What is a baby?</i>

28:55.150 --> 28:57.824
<i>I must find out today</i>

28:57.986 --> 29:02.241
<i>What makes Jim Dear and Darling</i>

29:02.407 --> 29:08.255
<i>Act this way?</i>

29:22.719 --> 29:27.270
<i>Oh, my little star sweeper</i>

29:27.432 --> 29:31.278
<i>I'll sweep the stardust</i>

29:31.436 --> 29:33.905
<i>For you</i>

29:39.778 --> 29:44.284
<i>Little soft ï¬‚uffy sleeper</i>

29:44.449 --> 29:48.875
<i>Here comes a pink cloud</i>

29:49.037 --> 29:51.540
<i>For you</i>

29:58.046 --> 30:02.973
<i>Little wandering angel</i>

30:03.135 --> 30:06.480
<i>Fold up your wings</i>

30:06.638 --> 30:10.108
<i>Close your eyes</i>

30:15.605 --> 30:20.406
<i>And may love be your keeper</i>

30:34.041 --> 30:35.463
There, now.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.673
Little star sweeper.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.304
Dream on.

30:53.185 --> 30:55.108
Well, that should do it.

30:55.937 --> 30:58.406
We've got enough here
to take us halfway to China.

31:03.236 --> 31:06.206
Darling. Darling!

31:06.365 --> 31:08.288
We haven't much time.

31:08.450 --> 31:10.669
Jim, I just can't leave him.

31:10.827 --> 31:12.921
He's still so small and helpless.

31:13.080 --> 31:14.753
He'll be all right.

31:14.915 --> 31:18.590
Now come on. If he wakes up,
we'll never get away.

31:18.752 --> 31:20.971
Jim, I feel so guilty
deserting him like this.

31:21.129 --> 31:22.927
Nonsense.

31:25.175 --> 31:28.019
Hey. What's the matter with Lady?

31:28.178 --> 31:30.897
She thinks we're running out on him.

31:32.057 --> 31:33.354
Don't worry, old girl.

31:33.517 --> 31:35.770
We'll be back in a few days.

31:35.936 --> 31:37.279
And Aunt Sarah will be here.

31:37.437 --> 31:39.906
With you here to help her...

31:40.065 --> 31:41.692
There's the old girl now.

31:42.692 --> 31:45.616
Coming, Aunt Sarah. Coming!

31:45.779 --> 31:48.658
Sorry I'm late, dears.
Hope I haven't kept you waiting.

31:48.824 --> 31:50.542
- Let me take your things.
- No.

31:50.700 --> 31:53.078
No fussing. I know my way around.

31:53.245 --> 31:55.339
On your way.
Mustn't miss your train.

31:55.497 --> 31:58.125
Have a good time,
and don't worry about a thing.

31:58.291 --> 32:00.043
Goodbye, dears. Goodbye.

32:00.210 --> 32:02.338
Goodbye.

32:02.504 --> 32:05.223
Now to see that big nephew of mine.

32:17.227 --> 32:19.446
You adorable little...

32:19.604 --> 32:21.857
Good gracious!
What are you doing here?

32:22.023 --> 32:24.742
Go on, now. Shoo, shoo.
Scat. Get out of here.

32:26.027 --> 32:27.370
There, there.

32:27.529 --> 32:31.500
Aunt Sarah won't let
that dog frighten you any more.

32:31.658 --> 32:34.286
No, no, no.

32:36.830 --> 32:42.428
<i>Rock-a-bye baby on the treetop</i>

32:42.586 --> 32:44.884
<i>When the wind blows</i>

33:16.203 --> 33:20.049
<i>We are Siamese if you please</i>

33:21.625 --> 33:26.882
<i>We are Siamese if you don't please</i>

33:27.047 --> 33:32.224
<i>Now we looking over our new domicile</i>

33:32.385 --> 33:36.265
<i>If we like we stay
for maybe quite a while</i>

33:48.527 --> 33:52.703
Do you seeing that thing
swimming round and round?

33:52.864 --> 33:54.207
Yes.

33:54.908 --> 33:58.082
Maybe we could reaching in
and make it drown.

34:00.121 --> 34:03.170
If we sneaking up upon it carefully...

34:04.834 --> 34:07.053
<i>There will be a head for you</i>

34:07.212 --> 34:09.260
<i>A tail for me</i>

34:32.404 --> 34:34.452
Do you hear what I hear?

34:35.447 --> 34:37.667
A baby CW-

34:37.826 --> 34:41.376
<i>Where we finding baby
there are milk nearby</i>

34:42.789 --> 34:46.510
<i>If we look in baby buggy
there could be</i>

34:47.835 --> 34:52.216
<i>Plenty milk for you
and also some for me</i>

35:02.309 --> 35:03.811
What's going on down there?

35:05.228 --> 35:07.731
Merciful heavens! My darlings.

35:07.897 --> 35:09.899
My precious pets.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.824
That wicked animal.

35:13.987 --> 35:18.663
Attacking my poor,
innocent little angels.

35:23.079 --> 35:24.456
Good afternoon, ma'am.

35:24.623 --> 35:26.421
What can I do for you?

35:26.583 --> 35:29.177
I want a muzzle.
A good, strong muzzle.

35:29.336 --> 35:31.839
Oh, yes, ma'am.
Now here's our latest.

35:32.005 --> 35:34.804
Combination leash and muzzle.

35:34.966 --> 35:37.014
Now, we'll just slip it on like this,

35:37.177 --> 35:38.599
and... No! No, no, no.

35:38.762 --> 35:41.060
Nice doggy. No, don't wiggle.

35:41.222 --> 35:43.600
Steady, now.
Now... Now, now.

35:43.767 --> 35:45.189
Careful, you little...

35:45.352 --> 35:46.774
Watch out.

35:47.145 --> 35:49.648
- Careful, doggy.
- Come back!

35:49.814 --> 35:52.112
Get over here, I say.
Come back here.

37:28.913 --> 37:32.008
Hey, Pige, what are you doing
on this side of the tracks?

37:32.167 --> 37:33.635
I thought you...

37:33.793 --> 37:34.885
<i>Wh...?</i>

37:36.337 --> 37:38.840
You poor kid.

37:39.007 --> 37:41.351
We've got to get this off.

37:42.552 --> 37:45.897
I think I know the very place.

37:46.055 --> 37:47.898
Come on.

37:51.144 --> 37:52.737
Well, here we are.

37:52.896 --> 37:55.524
- The zoo?
- Sure.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.448
No, no. This way.

37:59.611 --> 38:01.705
Follow me.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.253
- Oh.
- What's the matter, Pige?

38:12.415 --> 38:15.043
- We can't go in.
- Why not?

38:15.210 --> 38:18.180
<i>- The sign says...
- Yeah, that's...</i>

38:18.338 --> 38:20.386
- That's the angle.
- Angle?

38:20.548 --> 38:22.596
Look. We'll wait for the right...

38:24.761 --> 38:25.853
Here we are now.

38:26.012 --> 38:28.014
Just lay low.

38:37.690 --> 38:40.068
- Hey, you!
- I beg your pardon.

38:40.235 --> 38:43.580
- Were you addressing...?
- What's the matter? Can't you read?

38:43.738 --> 38:45.866
Why, yes, in several languages.

38:46.032 --> 38:48.376
Oh, a wise guy?

38:48.535 --> 38:52.381
All right, now, what's
this creature doing here?

38:52.539 --> 38:55.133
- He's not my dog.
- He's not?

38:55.291 --> 38:56.383
Go away. Get down.

38:56.543 --> 38:58.466
Go on. Why, certainly not, officer.

38:58.628 --> 39:00.505
I suppose you'll be tellin' me next

39:00.672 --> 39:02.424
it was the dog that was whistling?

39:02.590 --> 39:03.933
I'm certain I don't know.

39:04.092 --> 39:06.220
Oh! So I'm a liar now, am I?

39:06.386 --> 39:08.104
Well, you listen to me.

39:08.263 --> 39:10.436
Resisting an officer of the law.

39:10.598 --> 39:11.895
You're gonna pay.

39:13.059 --> 39:14.481
Pull a knife on me, will you?

39:14.644 --> 39:16.442
Trying to assassinate me, you are.

39:16.604 --> 39:18.402
Carrying concealed weapons.

39:26.531 --> 39:27.783
Come on, Pige.

39:27.949 --> 39:30.122
The place is ours.

39:35.623 --> 39:38.092
We'd better go through
this place from A to Z.

39:39.752 --> 39:40.878
Apes.

39:42.046 --> 39:44.799
No, no. No use even asking them.

39:44.966 --> 39:46.013
They wouldn't understand.

39:46.175 --> 39:47.472
They wouldn't?

39:48.636 --> 39:50.980
Too closely related to humans.

39:51.848 --> 39:54.727
Alligators. Now there's an idea.

39:54.893 --> 39:58.363
Say, Al, do you suppose you could
nip this contraption off for us?

39:58.521 --> 40:01.024
Glad to oblige.

40:01.190 --> 40:03.238
Whoa. Whoa!

40:14.245 --> 40:16.088
If anybody ever needed
a muzzle, it's him.

40:16.247 --> 40:17.965
Timber!

40:18.124 --> 40:19.797
Pigeon, look out!

40:21.002 --> 40:23.004
Now what harebrained idiot would...

40:23.171 --> 40:25.390
Hey, look. A beaver.

40:28.468 --> 40:30.596
There's the answer to our problem.

40:30.762 --> 40:32.435
Let me see here.

40:33.890 --> 40:37.144
Six-foot-six and seven-sixteenth inches.

40:37.310 --> 40:38.482
Pardon me, friend.

40:39.687 --> 40:42.657
- I wonder if you'd do us a little...
- Busy, sonny. Busy.

40:42.815 --> 40:44.863
Can't stop to gossip now.

40:45.026 --> 40:47.870
Got to slide this sycamore to the...

40:48.029 --> 40:49.030
...swamp.

40:49.197 --> 40:51.040
Well, this will only take a second.

40:51.199 --> 40:53.327
Only a second? Listen, sonny.

40:53.493 --> 40:57.418
Do you realize every second,
70 centimeters of water

40:57.580 --> 40:59.503
is wasted over that spillway?

40:59.666 --> 41:02.840
- Yeah, but...
- Gotta get this log movin', sonny.

41:03.002 --> 41:04.470
Gotta get it moving.

41:04.629 --> 41:07.508
'Taint the cuttin' takes the time.

41:07.674 --> 41:10.223
It's the doggone haulin'.

41:11.844 --> 41:13.892
The haulin'. Exactly.

41:14.055 --> 41:17.434
- Now, what you need...
- I'd better bisect this section here.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.602
What you need is a log puller.

41:20.645 --> 41:23.524
I said a log puller!

41:25.108 --> 41:27.156
I ain't deaf, sonny.

41:27.318 --> 41:28.661
There's no need to...

41:28.820 --> 41:31.118
Did you say log puller?

41:31.280 --> 41:34.375
And by a lucky coincidence
you see before you,

41:34.534 --> 41:38.038
modeled by the lovely little lady,
the new, improved,

41:38.204 --> 41:41.925
patented, handy dandy,
never-fail little giant log puller.

41:42.083 --> 41:44.051
The busy beaver's friend.

41:44.210 --> 41:45.462
You don't say?

41:45.628 --> 41:47.926
Guaranteed not to wear,
tear, rip or ravel.

41:48.089 --> 41:50.467
Show the customer the merchandise.

41:50.633 --> 41:53.887
And it cuts log-hauling time 66 percent.

41:54.679 --> 41:57.148
Sixty-six percent?

41:58.307 --> 41:59.559
Think of that.

41:59.726 --> 42:02.275
- Well, how's it work?
- Why, it's no work at all.

42:02.437 --> 42:04.986
You merely slip this ring
over the limb like this

42:05.148 --> 42:06.320
and haul it off.

42:06.482 --> 42:07.859
<i>Say...</i>

42:08.026 --> 42:10.279
You mind if I slip it on for size?

42:10.445 --> 42:12.288
Help yourself, friend.

42:12.447 --> 42:15.621
OK. Don't mind if I do.

42:16.743 --> 42:19.246
How do you get
the consarned thing off, sonny?

42:19.412 --> 42:22.291
Glad you brought that up.
Glad you brought that up.

42:22.457 --> 42:25.461
To remove it, simply place
the strap between your teeth...

42:25.626 --> 42:27.299
Like this?

42:27.462 --> 42:30.636
Correct, friend. Now bite hard.

42:31.674 --> 42:33.267
You see?

42:33.426 --> 42:34.643
It's off.

42:34.802 --> 42:37.271
Say, that is simple.

42:37.430 --> 42:40.684
Well, friend, we'll be
on our way now, so...

42:40.850 --> 42:43.603
Not so fast now, sonny..

42:43.770 --> 42:46.444
I'll have to make
certain it's satisfactory

42:46.606 --> 42:48.950
before we settle on a price.

42:49.108 --> 42:50.860
Oh, no, it's all yours, friend.

42:51.027 --> 42:52.074
You can keep it.

42:53.071 --> 42:55.369
I can?

42:56.824 --> 42:58.076
It's a free sample.

42:59.368 --> 43:01.621
Well, thanks a lot.

43:02.747 --> 43:04.090
Thanks ever so...

43:21.557 --> 43:23.150
Say!

43:23.309 --> 43:25.778
It works swell.

43:29.315 --> 43:31.784
But when she put
that horrible muzzle on me...

43:31.943 --> 43:34.537
Say no more.
I get the whole picture.

43:34.695 --> 43:36.322
Aunts. Cats. Muzzles.

43:36.489 --> 43:40.210
Well, that's what comes of tying
yourself down to one family.

43:40.368 --> 43:41.836
Haven't you a family?

43:41.994 --> 43:43.462
One for every day of the week.

43:43.621 --> 43:46.420
The point is, none of them have me.

43:46.582 --> 43:49.085
I'm afraid I don't understand.

43:49.252 --> 43:50.253
It's simple.

43:50.419 --> 43:52.046
You see...

43:52.213 --> 43:53.635
Hey.

43:55.716 --> 43:58.139
Something tells me it's suppertime.

43:58.302 --> 44:00.225
Come on.
I'll show you what I mean.

44:02.598 --> 44:03.941
Take the Schultzes here.

44:04.100 --> 44:07.149
Little Fritzie, that's me, Pige,

44:07.311 --> 44:08.528
makes this his Monday home.

44:08.688 --> 44:11.487
- Monday home?
- Ach, ja.

44:11.649 --> 44:12.992
Monday's is Mama Schultz

44:13.151 --> 44:14.994
<i>cooking der Wiener Schnitzel.</i>

44:16.571 --> 44:18.198
Delicious.

44:18.364 --> 44:20.958
Now, O'Brien's here
is where little Mike,

44:21.117 --> 44:23.119
that's me again, Pige,

44:23.286 --> 44:26.210
- comes of a Tuesday.
- Of a Tuesday?

44:26.372 --> 44:27.498
Begorra.

44:27.665 --> 44:31.340
That's when they're after havin'
their darlin' corned beef.

44:32.003 --> 44:35.348
You see, Pige,
when you're footloose and collar-free,

44:35.506 --> 44:38.726
well, you take nothing but the best.

44:40.636 --> 44:42.229
Hey! Tony's!

44:42.388 --> 44:47.315
Of course. The very place
for a very special occasion.

44:49.061 --> 44:51.985
No, this way, Pige.
I have my own private entrance.

44:57.153 --> 44:59.497
Wait here.

45:01.782 --> 45:04.661
Just one minute. I'm a-comin'. I'm...

45:04.827 --> 45:08.001
What's a-matter? Somebody's
a-makin' da April Fool...

45:09.665 --> 45:11.838
Oh, hello, Butch.

45:12.001 --> 45:13.628
Where you been so long?

45:13.794 --> 45:15.842
Hey, Joe, look who's here.

45:16.005 --> 45:19.100
Well, what do you know? It's Butch.

45:19.258 --> 45:21.352
Hey, hey, hey!

45:21.510 --> 45:24.764
Joe, bring some bones
for Butchy before he eat me up.

45:24.931 --> 45:26.808
OK, Tony. OK.

45:26.974 --> 45:28.521
Bones a-coming up.

45:34.899 --> 45:37.072
What's this?

45:37.235 --> 45:38.862
Hey, Joe, look.

45:39.028 --> 45:40.951
Butchy, he's got a new girlfriend.

45:41.113 --> 45:42.911
Well, a son of a gun!

45:43.074 --> 45:45.293
He's a got a cockerel Spanish a-girl.

45:46.494 --> 45:49.873
Hey, she's a pretty sweet kiddo, Butch.

45:50.039 --> 45:53.885
You take-a Tony's advice
and a-settle down with this-a one?

45:56.212 --> 45:57.589
"This a-one?"

45:57.755 --> 45:59.348
This one. This... Oh!

45:59.507 --> 46:01.225
Tony, you know.

46:01.384 --> 46:04.479
He's a-not a-speaking
English a-pretty good.

46:05.471 --> 46:08.725
Now, first we fix-a the table.

46:08.891 --> 46:12.862
- Here's your bones, Tony.
- OK, bones. Bones?

46:13.020 --> 46:16.194
What's the matter for you, Joe?
I break-a your face.

46:16.357 --> 46:19.577
Tonight, Butch,
he gets the best in the house.

46:19.735 --> 46:21.282
OK, Tony, you the boss.

46:21.445 --> 46:23.243
Tell me, what's your pleasure?

46:23.406 --> 46:26.080
Ã€ la carte? Dinner?

46:28.244 --> 46:29.245
OK.

46:29.412 --> 46:31.005
Hey, Joe.

46:31.163 --> 46:32.210
Butch-a, he says

46:32.373 --> 46:36.003
he wants-a two spaghetti speciale.

46:36.168 --> 46:38.045
Heavy on the meats-a ball.

46:38.212 --> 46:40.089
Tony, dogs don't talk.

46:40.256 --> 46:43.601
- He's a-talkin' to me!
- OK, he's a-talkin' to you.

46:43.759 --> 46:44.931
You the boss.

46:49.140 --> 46:50.437
Now here you are.

46:50.599 --> 46:53.318
The best spaghetti in town.

47:09.327 --> 47:12.957
<i>For this is the night</i>

47:13.122 --> 47:16.092
<i>It's a beautiful night</i>

47:16.250 --> 47:18.594
<i>And we call it</i>

47:18.753 --> 47:23.099
<i>Bella notte</i>

47:23.257 --> 47:26.386
<i>Look at the skies</i>

47:26.552 --> 47:29.977
<i>They have stars in their eyes</i>

47:30.139 --> 47:36.397
<i>On this lovely bella notte</i>

47:37.271 --> 47:39.649
<i>Side by side</i>

47:39.815 --> 47:42.864
<i>With your loved one</i>

47:43.027 --> 47:49.285
<i>You'll find enchantment here</i>

47:50.284 --> 47:54.915
<i>The night will weave its magic spell</i>

47:55.081 --> 48:00.759
<i>When the one you love is near</i>

48:00.920 --> 48:02.763
<i>For</i>

48:02.922 --> 48:06.176
<i>This is the night</i>

48:06.342 --> 48:10.973
<i>And the heavens are right</i>

48:11.138 --> 48:13.982
<i>On this lovely</i>

48:14.141 --> 48:20.148
<i>Bella notte</i>

48:26.237 --> 48:29.741
<i>This is the night</i>

48:29.907 --> 48:34.037
<i>It's a beautiful night</i>

48:34.203 --> 48:36.297
<i>And we call it</i>

48:36.455 --> 48:41.552
<i>Bella notte</i>

48:42.420 --> 48:45.424
<i>Look at the skies</i>

48:45.589 --> 48:49.810
<i>They have stars in their eyes</i>

48:49.969 --> 48:52.097
<i>On this lovely</i>

48:52.263 --> 48:58.236
<i>Bella notte</i>

48:58.394 --> 49:03.821
<i>Side by side with your loved one</i>

49:03.983 --> 49:09.990
<i>You'll find enchantment here</i>

49:11.157 --> 49:15.754
<i>The night will weave its magic spell</i>

<i>On this lovely</i>

49:35.556 --> 49:41.814
<i>Bella notte</i>

49:59.622 --> 50:02.000
Oh! Oh, dear.

50:03.375 --> 50:04.877
Is something wrong, Pige?

50:05.044 --> 50:08.093
- It's morning.
- Yeah.

50:09.423 --> 50:10.720
So it is.

50:10.883 --> 50:12.806
I should have been home hours ago.

50:12.968 --> 50:15.062
Why? Because
you still believe in that

50:15.221 --> 50:18.225
"ever faithful old dog Tray"
routine?

50:19.683 --> 50:21.526
Come on, Pige.

50:21.685 --> 50:24.689
<i>'</i> Open UP VOW eyes.
' Open my eyes?

50:24.855 --> 50:27.028
To what a dog's life can really be.

50:27.191 --> 50:29.319
I'll show you what I mean.

50:32.029 --> 50:34.873
Look down there.
Tell me what you see.

50:37.826 --> 50:40.670
Well, I see nice homes

50:40.829 --> 50:42.581
with yards and fences.

50:42.748 --> 50:45.922
Exactly. Life on a leash.

50:46.085 --> 50:47.678
Look again, Pige.

50:50.172 --> 50:52.425
Look, there's a great
big hunk of world down there

50:52.591 --> 50:54.810
with no fence around it.

50:54.969 --> 50:58.314
Where two dogs can find
adventure and excitement.

50:58.472 --> 51:00.099
And beyond those distant hills,

51:00.266 --> 51:04.112
who knows what wonderful experiences?

51:04.270 --> 51:06.739
And it's all ours for the taking, Pige.

51:07.481 --> 51:09.154
It's all ours.

51:11.193 --> 51:12.661
It sounds wonderful.

51:12.820 --> 51:14.618
But?

51:16.282 --> 51:17.955
But who'd watch over the baby?

51:23.998 --> 51:25.625
You win.

51:25.791 --> 51:27.008
Come on.

51:27.167 --> 51:29.090
I'll take you home.

51:44.977 --> 51:47.071
<i>It's a beautiful night</i>

51:47.521 --> 51:49.774
<i>And they call it...</i>

51:53.444 --> 51:56.368
Not to change the subject, but...

51:56.530 --> 51:57.702
Ever chase chickens?

51:57.865 --> 51:59.492
I should say not!

52:00.534 --> 52:02.002
Then you've never lived.

52:02.161 --> 52:04.163
- But we shouldn't.
- I know.

52:04.330 --> 52:06.173
That's what makes it fun.

52:07.291 --> 52:09.419
Come on, kid.

52:09.585 --> 52:11.553
Start building some memories.

52:13.589 --> 52:15.591
But we...
We won't hurt the chickens?

52:15.758 --> 52:17.260
Hurt 'em? No!

52:17.426 --> 52:19.599
We'll just stir 'em up a bit.

52:26.977 --> 52:29.651
Just look at those fat, lazy biddies.

52:29.813 --> 52:31.941
Why, they should've been up hours ago.

52:43.744 --> 52:45.872
Some fun, hey, kid?

52:46.038 --> 52:48.382
Hey, what's going on in there?

52:48.916 --> 52:49.917
What's that?

52:50.084 --> 52:52.257
That's the signal to get going. Come on.

52:58.133 --> 53:01.262
- This is living, hey, kid!
- Is it?

53:01.762 --> 53:04.185
Come on, Pige. Follow me.

53:14.608 --> 53:18.704
You know, there's a little bit
of bird dog in all of us, Pige.

53:18.862 --> 53:19.954
Pige? Pige?

53:21.907 --> 53:23.784
Pige? Where are you, Pige?

53:24.910 --> 53:26.253
Pige?

53:28.080 --> 53:29.252
Pigeon?

53:31.542 --> 53:33.636
Oh, Pige!

55:16.271 --> 55:18.569
Hey. Hey, Dachsie, how we coming?

55:18.732 --> 55:20.826
Just one more chorus and we're out.

55:20.984 --> 55:23.157
OK. On a downbeat.

55:23.320 --> 55:26.324
One, <i>two...</i>

55:33.247 --> 55:35.249
Put her in number four, Bill,

55:35.415 --> 55:38.919
- while I check her license number.
- OK.

55:40.003 --> 55:42.005
All right, baby, in here.

55:44.550 --> 55:48.020
Well, look yous guys,
Miss Park Avenue herself.

55:48.178 --> 55:49.475
Blimey.

55:49.638 --> 55:52.141
A regular bloomin' debutante.

55:52.307 --> 55:54.776
Yeah. And pipe the crown jewel
she's wearin'.

55:54.935 --> 55:57.108
Hey, whatcha in for, sweetheart?

55:57.271 --> 55:59.615
Putting fleas on the butler?

56:05.904 --> 56:09.124
All right, you guys.
Lay off, will you?

56:09.283 --> 56:11.251
What's the matter, Peg?

56:11.410 --> 56:14.914
We was only havin'
a bit of sport, we was.

56:15.080 --> 56:17.833
Can't you see the poor kid's
scared enough already?

56:18.000 --> 56:21.300
<i>Pay no attention,
my little ochi chernye.</i>

56:21.461 --> 56:22.838
That's right, dearie.

56:23.005 --> 56:24.848
They don't mean no real harm.

56:25.007 --> 56:28.432
It's like Gorky says
in <i>Lower Depths,</i> quote:

56:28.594 --> 56:32.315
"Miserable being must find
more miserable being.

56:32.472 --> 56:34.520
Then he's happy-"

56:34.683 --> 56:37.653
- Unquote.
- Boris is a philosopher.

56:37.811 --> 56:39.484
Besides, little <i>bublichki,</i>

56:39.646 --> 56:41.239
wearing license here,

56:41.398 --> 56:44.698
that is like waving,
you should excuse the expression,

56:44.860 --> 56:46.954
red flag in front of bull.

56:47.112 --> 56:50.241
My license?
But what's wrong with it?

56:50.407 --> 56:52.501
There ain't nothin' wrong with it.

56:52.659 --> 56:54.832
Confidential,
there's not one dog here

56:54.995 --> 56:58.340
who would not give left hind leg
for such a knick-knack.

56:58.498 --> 57:01.718
That's your passport to freedom, honey
Without it...

57:01.877 --> 57:05.347
Hey- Hey, yous guys, look.

57:05.505 --> 57:08.133
Poor Nutsy is takin' the long walk.

57:11.345 --> 57:12.813
Where is he taking him?

57:12.971 --> 57:16.020
Through the one-way door, sister.

57:22.189 --> 57:25.159
You... You mean he's...

57:29.947 --> 57:31.995
Oh, well.

57:32.157 --> 57:34.034
A short life and a merry one.

57:34.201 --> 57:36.670
Yeah, that's what
the Tramp always says.

57:36.828 --> 57:38.705
- The Tramp?
- Now there's a bloke

57:38.872 --> 57:40.215
what never gets caught.

57:40.374 --> 57:43.218
He's given the slip to every
dogcatcher in this burg.

57:43.377 --> 57:47.382
You won't believe this, dearie,
but no matter how tight a jam he's in,

57:47.547 --> 57:50.221
that Tramp always finds some way out.

57:50.384 --> 57:52.512
I can quite easily believe that.

57:52.678 --> 57:54.726
But remember, my friends,

57:54.888 --> 57:57.437
even Tramp has his Achilles' heel.

57:57.599 --> 58:00.773
Pardon me, amigo.
What is this "chili heel"?

58:00.936 --> 58:03.155
Achilles' heel, Pedro.

58:03.313 --> 58:06.237
This is meaning his... weaknesses.

58:07.192 --> 58:09.115
The dames. Yeah.

58:10.320 --> 58:13.574
He has an eye
for a well-turned paw, he has.

58:13.740 --> 58:15.617
Let's see. There's been Lulu.

58:15.784 --> 58:17.001
Yeah, and Trixie.

58:17.160 --> 58:18.628
Und Fifi.

58:18.787 --> 58:20.039
And my sister,

58:20.205 --> 58:22.583
Rosita Chiquita Juanita Chihuahua.

58:22.749 --> 58:23.841
I think.

58:24.167 --> 58:25.589
What a dog.

58:25.752 --> 58:28.221
Yeah. Tell us about it, Peg.

58:28.380 --> 58:30.883
What a dog!

58:31.049 --> 58:33.893
Peg used to be
in the Dog and Pony Follies.

58:34.052 --> 58:36.350
<i>He's a tramp</i>

58:36.513 --> 58:38.641
<i>But they love him</i>

58:38.807 --> 58:42.528
<i>Breaks</i> a <i>new heart every day</i>

58:43.311 --> 58:45.484
<i>He's a tramp</i>

58:45.647 --> 58:47.570
<i>They adore him</i>

58:47.733 --> 58:51.863
<i>And I only hope he'll stay that way</i>

58:52.487 --> 58:54.706
<i>He's a tramp</i>

58:54.865 --> 58:56.867
<i>He's a scoundrel</i>

58:57.034 --> 58:59.082
<i>He's a rounder</i>

58:59.244 --> 59:01.417
<i>He's a cad</i>

59:01.580 --> 59:03.628
<i>He's a tramp</i>

59:03.790 --> 59:05.963
<i>But I love him</i>

59:06.126 --> 59:09.676
<i>Yes, even I have got it pretty bad</i>

59:10.922 --> 59:13.266
<i>You can never tell</i>

59:13.425 --> 59:15.393
<i>When he'll show up</i>

59:16.386 --> 59:18.980
<i>He gives you plenty of trouble</i>

59:20.599 --> 59:24.570
<i>I guess he's just a no 'count pup</i>

59:24.728 --> 59:28.232
<i>But I wish that he were double</i>

59:28.398 --> 59:30.366
<i>He's a tramp</i>

59:30.525 --> 59:32.994
<i>He's a rover</i>

59:33.153 --> 59:36.032
<i>And there's nothin' more to say</i>

59:37.157 --> 59:39.251
<i>If he's a tramp</i>

59:39.409 --> 59:41.161
<i>He's a good one</i>

59:41.328 --> 59:46.710
<i>And I wish that I could travel his way</i>

59:46.875 --> 59:56.728
<i>Wish that I could travel his way</i>

59:58.428 --> 59:59.429
Yeah.

59:59.596 --> 01:00:01.269
But he never takes them serious.

01:00:01.932 --> 01:00:06.813
But someday he is meeting
someone different.

01:00:06.978 --> 01:00:09.652
Some delicate, fragile creature

01:00:09.815 --> 01:00:13.194
who's giving him a wish
to shelter and protect.

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.785
Like Miss Park Avenue here, matey?

01:00:16.947 --> 01:00:18.915
Could be.

01:00:19.074 --> 01:00:22.374
- But when he does...
- Yeah. I'm way ahead of ya.

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:25.039
Under the spell of true love...

01:00:25.205 --> 01:00:27.674
The poor chump grows careless...

01:00:27.833 --> 01:00:29.710
The Cossacks are picking him <i>up...</i>

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:32.425
And it's curtains for the Tramp.

01:00:35.090 --> 01:00:36.763
It's the little cooker, Bill.

01:00:36.925 --> 01:00:39.599
- In number four.
- OK.

01:00:41.096 --> 01:00:42.473
All right, baby.

01:00:42.639 --> 01:00:45.233
They've come to take you home.

01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:48.396
You're too nice a girl
to be in this place.

01:00:58.947 --> 01:01:00.199
Courage, man.

01:01:00.365 --> 01:01:01.582
Courage!

01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:02.867
<i>But...</i>

01:01:03.034 --> 01:01:06.038
I've never even considered matrimony.

01:01:06.204 --> 01:01:08.081
Nor I.

01:01:08.248 --> 01:01:10.717
But no matter which of us she accepts,

01:01:10.876 --> 01:01:13.595
we'll always be the best of friends.

01:01:14.921 --> 01:01:16.093
Now remember,

01:01:16.256 --> 01:01:19.226
not a word about her
unfortunate experience.

01:01:19.384 --> 01:01:22.979
- We don't want to hurt her feelings
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:25.603
Lassie.

01:01:25.765 --> 01:01:28.860
Miss Lady, ma'am.

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:32.068
Please, I don't want to see anybody.

01:01:32.230 --> 01:01:34.699
Now, now, lassie.

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:36.360
Don't feel that way about it.

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:39.120
Of course not, Miss Lady.

01:01:39.279 --> 01:01:42.704
Why, some of the finest people
I ever tracked down

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:44.413
- were jailbirds.
- Quiet!

01:01:44.576 --> 01:01:46.294
You great loony!

01:01:47.245 --> 01:01:49.464
Please, lassie.

01:01:49.623 --> 01:01:53.093
We've come with a proposition
for helpin' ya.

01:01:53.251 --> 01:01:55.595
Help me? What do you mean?

01:01:55.754 --> 01:01:57.677
Well, now...

01:01:57.839 --> 01:01:59.716
You see, lassie...

01:01:59.883 --> 01:02:02.227
Neither of us is as young
as we used to be.

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:05.229
But we're still in the prime of life.

01:02:05.388 --> 01:02:06.389
Aye.

01:02:06.556 --> 01:02:10.060
And we've both got
very comfortable homes

01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:12.901
That's right. Where we know

01:02:13.063 --> 01:02:16.237
you'll be welcome
and appreciated, Miss Lady.

01:02:16.399 --> 01:02:20.996
<i>So...</i> So, to come
directly to the point...

01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:22.997
If you could...

01:02:23.156 --> 01:02:26.877
...find it possible to...

01:02:27.035 --> 01:02:28.161
<i>To...</i>

01:02:28.328 --> 01:02:31.753
You're both very kind,
and I do appreciate it.

01:02:31.915 --> 01:02:33.838
- But...
- Oh, Pigeon.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.877
<i>Oh, Pi...</i>

01:02:36.044 --> 01:02:37.967
Oh! Hi, boys.

01:02:41.633 --> 01:02:43.727
Anything new in the kennel club set?

01:02:48.139 --> 01:02:50.733
A little something
I picked up for you, Pige.

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:02.371
Looks like I'm the one
that's in the doghouse.

01:03:02.529 --> 01:03:07.000
If this person is
annoying you, Miss Lady...

01:03:07.158 --> 01:03:10.002
We'll gladly throw the rascal out.

01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:12.664
That won't be necessary. Thank you.

01:03:12.831 --> 01:03:15.004
Very well, ma'am.

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:17.965
<i>You... You...</i>

01:03:18.128 --> 01:03:20.222
...mongrel!

01:03:24.926 --> 01:03:27.520
Come on, Pige.

01:03:27.679 --> 01:03:29.977
It wasn't my fault.

01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:34.819
I thought you were
right behind me. Honest.

01:03:34.978 --> 01:03:37.231
When I heard they'd
taken you to the pound...

01:03:37.397 --> 01:03:39.695
Don't even mention that horrible place.

01:03:39.858 --> 01:03:42.862
I was so embarrassed and...

01:03:43.028 --> 01:03:46.077
- And frightened.
- Now, now.

01:03:46.239 --> 01:03:50.039
Who could ever harm
a cute little trick like you?

01:03:50.201 --> 01:03:52.249
Trick? Trick!

01:03:52.412 --> 01:03:56.212
- That reminds me, who is Trixie?
- Trixie?

01:03:56.374 --> 01:03:59.002
And Lulu and Fifi
and Rosita Chiquita wh...

01:03:59.169 --> 01:04:01.217
- Whatever her name is.
- Chiquita...

01:04:01.379 --> 01:04:03.302
Oh! Yes! Well, I-I...

01:04:03.465 --> 01:04:06.810
As far as I'm concerned,
you needn't worry about your old heel.

01:04:06.968 --> 01:04:07.969
MY heel?

01:04:08.136 --> 01:04:10.230
I don't need you
to shelter and protect me.

01:04:10.388 --> 01:04:12.857
- But...
- If you grow careless, don't blame me.

01:04:13.016 --> 01:04:16.691
I don't care if the Cossacks
do pick you up! Goodbye.

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:19.235
And take this with you.

01:05:26.506 --> 01:05:28.508
Stop that.

01:05:31.719 --> 01:05:33.437
Hush, now, hush.

01:05:37.725 --> 01:05:39.398
Stop that racket!

01:05:42.021 --> 01:05:43.147
What's wrong, Pige?

01:05:43.314 --> 01:05:44.987
- A rat!
- Where?

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:47.323
Upstairs, in the baby's room!

01:05:47.485 --> 01:05:50.159
- How do I get in?
- The little door.

01:05:50.321 --> 01:05:51.618
On the porch.

01:07:37.929 --> 01:07:39.351
Merciful heavens!

01:07:39.514 --> 01:07:43.109
Oh, you poor little darling.

01:07:43.268 --> 01:07:46.192
No, no, no.
Thank goodness you're not hurt.

01:07:46.354 --> 01:07:49.233
You... You vicious brutes. Back!

01:07:49.399 --> 01:07:50.946
Get back!

01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:53.328
Go on! Get back!

01:07:53.486 --> 01:07:57.366
The pound. The pound, that's it.
I'll call the pound.

01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:02.082
Come here, you. Come here!

01:08:03.162 --> 01:08:04.505
Come on, come on.

01:08:04.664 --> 01:08:06.712
Come along. I'll call them this minute.

01:08:06.874 --> 01:08:09.423
I won't sleep a wink
with that brute in the house.

01:08:17.301 --> 01:08:19.975
Hello? Hello!

01:08:24.142 --> 01:08:27.191
I don't care if you
are alone there, young man.

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:30.402
I insist you pick him up immediately.

01:08:38.281 --> 01:08:40.408
Darling, look.

01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:45.630
If you want my advice
you'll destroy that animal at once.

01:08:45.787 --> 01:08:47.335
Don't worry, ma'am.

01:08:47.790 --> 01:08:50.009
We've been after this one for months.

01:08:50.167 --> 01:08:51.966
We'll take care of him.

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:57.888
- What do you suppose...?
- Say, what's going on here?

01:08:58.051 --> 01:08:59.849
Just picking up a stray, mister.

01:09:00.011 --> 01:09:02.264
Come on, giddap.

01:09:02.430 --> 01:09:03.773
Caught him attacking a baby.

01:09:03.930 --> 01:09:05.228
- Good heavens.
- My baby.

01:09:05.390 --> 01:09:07.644
Aunt Sarah!

01:09:09.270 --> 01:09:10.692
Aunt Sarah!

01:09:12.689 --> 01:09:14.613
I was certain he was no good

01:09:14.776 --> 01:09:17.029
the moment I first laid eyes on him.

01:09:17.194 --> 01:09:19.743
Yeah, <i>but...</i>

01:09:19.906 --> 01:09:23.160
I never thought
he'd do a thing like that.

01:09:24.577 --> 01:09:26.750
Thank goodness I got there in time.
There they were...

01:09:26.912 --> 01:09:30.042
No, I'm sure there must be
some mistake. Lady wouldn't...

01:09:32.292 --> 01:09:35.046
Watch out! That dog's loose.
Keep her away.

01:09:35.212 --> 01:09:37.682
Nonsense.
She's trying to tell us something.

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.138
What is it, old girl?

01:09:41.928 --> 01:09:43.100
What are you try...

01:09:43.261 --> 01:09:44.935
Darling, Aunt Sarah, come here.

01:09:45.098 --> 01:09:46.645
What is it, Jim?

01:09:47.265 --> 01:09:48.267
A rat!

01:09:48.434 --> 01:09:50.107
A rat?

01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:52.020
We should've known.

01:09:52.188 --> 01:09:55.237
I misjudged him.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:56.401
Badly.

01:09:56.567 --> 01:10:00.037
Come on. We got to stop that wagon.

01:10:00.196 --> 01:10:03.541
But, man, we don't know
which way they've gone.

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:05.910
We'll track 'em down.

01:10:06.077 --> 01:10:07.249
And then?

01:10:07.412 --> 01:10:09.005
We'll hold 'em.

01:10:09.163 --> 01:10:11.040
Hold 'em at bay.

01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:24.478
Now what?

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:27.811
The scent. Follow the scent.

01:10:34.689 --> 01:10:36.862
Let's face it, man.

01:10:37.024 --> 01:10:39.743
We both know you've lost
your sense of smell.

01:11:46.177 --> 01:11:47.645
Go on, get out of here.

01:11:48.387 --> 01:11:49.479
Go on, get away.

01:11:55.186 --> 01:11:56.904
Easy. Go on, get away.

01:11:57.063 --> 01:11:58.690
Watch it now. Watch it!

01:12:13.454 --> 01:12:14.876
Hi, Pige.

01:12:45.778 --> 01:12:48.702
All right, everybody, watch the birdy.

01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:01.043
Steady, now.

01:13:02.795 --> 01:13:04.138
Hold it.

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:09.719
I guess I used a little too much.

01:13:12.680 --> 01:13:15.183
Darling, visitors.

01:13:15.349 --> 01:13:16.441
Visitors?

01:13:17.393 --> 01:13:19.395
Why, it's Jock.

01:13:21.022 --> 01:13:22.990
And good old Trusty.

01:13:23.774 --> 01:13:25.196
Careful now, man.

01:13:25.359 --> 01:13:28.238
Careful. It's a wee bit slippery.

01:13:28.529 --> 01:13:30.076
Yes, yes.

01:13:32.158 --> 01:13:34.456
All right, boy. We'll let 'em in.

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:37.747
No, no, not you, young man.

01:13:37.914 --> 01:13:39.211
You're going to take a nap.

01:13:39.749 --> 01:13:41.717
Well, Merry Christmas.

01:13:41.876 --> 01:13:44.220
Come in. If you'll just
step into the parlor,

01:13:44.378 --> 01:13:46.176
I'll see about refreshments.

01:13:46.339 --> 01:13:49.809
Darling, where did you
put the dog biscuits?

01:13:49.967 --> 01:13:52.345
The box Aunt Sarah sent for Christmas.

01:13:52.511 --> 01:13:53.979
In the kitchen, Jim, dear.

01:13:54.805 --> 01:13:56.728
No doubt about it.

01:13:56.891 --> 01:13:59.360
They've got their mother's eyes.

01:14:01.228 --> 01:14:02.525
Aye.

01:14:05.441 --> 01:14:07.910
But there's a bit of
their father in them too.

01:14:09.946 --> 01:14:13.871
Well, and I see you finally
acquired a collar.

01:14:14.033 --> 01:14:17.082
Oh. Yes.

01:14:17.244 --> 01:14:18.541
Complete with license.

01:14:18.704 --> 01:14:21.799
Oh, yeah, a new collar.

01:14:21.958 --> 01:14:24.837
Caught the scent the moment
I came in the house.

01:14:25.670 --> 01:14:27.047
Trusty, I says,

01:14:27.213 --> 01:14:31.218
Trusty, somebody's
wearing a new collar.

01:14:32.218 --> 01:14:35.643
'Course, my sense of smell

01:14:35.805 --> 01:14:38.183
is very highly developed.

01:14:38.349 --> 01:14:39.976
Runs in the family, you know.

01:14:40.142 --> 01:14:42.565
There'll be no livin'
with him from now on.

01:14:42.728 --> 01:14:47.325
As my grandpappy,
Old Reliable, used to say...

01:14:47.483 --> 01:14:51.533
I don't recollect if I've ever
mentioned Old Reliable before.

01:14:51.696 --> 01:14:53.824
No, you haven't, Uncle Trusty.

01:14:55.533 --> 01:14:57.661
I haven't?

01:14:57.827 --> 01:14:59.795
<i>Well...</i>

01:14:59.954 --> 01:15:03.379
As Old Reliable used to say...

01:15:03.541 --> 01:15:04.963
<i>He'd say...</i>

01:15:06.252 --> 01:15:08.346
<i>He'd say...</i>

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:15.386
Doggone.

01:15:15.553 --> 01:15:17.726
You know,

01:15:17.888 --> 01:15:21.483
I clean forgot what it was
he used to say.

01:15:26.313 --> 01:15:30.864
<i>Peace, my children</i>

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:36.033
<i>Of good will</i>

01:15:36.198 --> 01:15:39.498
<i>Peace, my children</i>

01:15:39.660 --> 01:15:41.662
<i>Peace</i>

01:15:41.829 --> 01:15:44.708
<i>Be</i>

01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:48.754
<i>Still</i>

01:15:49.305 --> 01:15:55.880
