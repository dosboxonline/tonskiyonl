00:12.316 --> 00:16.016
Why do you think you're
ready to transcend?

00:16.146 --> 00:18.801
Why?

00:18.931 --> 00:21.151
Because I've listened to
every word you've said.

00:21.282 --> 00:24.546
I've studied the scripts
that you have wrote.

00:24.676 --> 00:26.417
I've listened to every speech.

00:26.548 --> 00:30.726
I've-- I've cataloged
every moment.

00:30.856 --> 00:35.731
I don't think there's a way
that I'm not ready to transcend.

00:35.861 --> 00:40.518
I hunger for the next realm.

00:40.649 --> 00:42.999
I can't wait.

00:43.130 --> 00:47.351
I mean, because it sounds
fucking sick, honestly.

00:47.482 --> 00:49.266
This tree that
we're on is burning

00:49.397 --> 00:51.877
and it's telling us to get off.

00:52.008 --> 00:54.010
It's too hot.

00:54.141 --> 00:56.273
It's full of pain.

00:56.404 --> 01:02.279
In my heart, I know that
we're meant to be so much more.

01:02.410 --> 01:06.370
I had a family before, and
I left them to come with you.

01:06.501 --> 01:09.678
Because of your teachings,
I convinced a Chinese lady

01:09.808 --> 01:11.984
with dementia I was her son.

01:12.115 --> 01:13.464
I don't even know
how it happened,

01:13.595 --> 01:16.815
but just kind of
channeling you--

01:16.946 --> 01:20.515
and I got like $13,000 out
of her before she realized I

01:20.645 --> 01:22.430
didn't actually know
how to speak Mandarin.

01:22.560 --> 01:25.607
I was just kind of
doing the sounds.

01:25.737 --> 01:28.218
Any final thoughts?

01:28.349 --> 01:32.266
Just thank you.

01:32.396 --> 01:36.705
I feel too lucky to
have met this family.

01:36.835 --> 01:42.363
Me and you fucking
getting slurped up.

01:42.493 --> 01:44.104
God's watching.

01:44.234 --> 01:46.018
Buddha will probably be there.

01:46.149 --> 01:49.152
Let's all try to get along.

01:49.283 --> 01:50.806
Marilyn Monroe.
Oh.

01:50.936 --> 01:52.068
You're getting it from the back.

01:52.199 --> 01:52.982
Oh.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.636
You know what I'm saying?

01:54.766 --> 01:57.465
Even if there's one person
that we may not like--

01:57.595 --> 01:58.683
Maybe Marlon Brando.

01:58.814 --> 02:00.294
You ever see him
when he was young?

02:00.424 --> 02:01.599
Piece of ass.

02:01.730 --> 02:03.688
And in heaven, being
gay is not bad.

02:03.819 --> 02:05.995
It's actually cool.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.607
Let's welcome
him into our fold.

02:09.738 --> 02:13.568
I can't wait to spend
forever with you, dawg.

02:13.698 --> 02:18.050
It's going to be awesome,
me and you forever.

02:18.181 --> 02:19.139
Forever.

02:25.754 --> 02:31.890
Worms, that's all we are--

02:32.021 --> 02:37.722
wasting our days writhing
in the mud, bound to vessels

02:37.853 --> 02:41.639
that suffocate our potential.

02:41.770 --> 02:47.471
But for this family, for those
who know the truth, today

02:47.602 --> 02:52.346
we reject our earthly
bondage and embrace

02:52.476 --> 02:54.826
our rightful destiny.

02:54.957 --> 03:03.095
Today we grow legs, sprout
wings, and open eyes

03:03.226 --> 03:06.882
that see for the first time.

03:07.012 --> 03:12.017
Today we return to Jalanzana.

03:12.148 --> 03:13.280
To Jalanzana.

03:13.410 --> 03:14.281
Xana.

03:18.589 --> 03:20.983
Hey, dude, check it out.

03:21.113 --> 03:22.158
What?

03:22.289 --> 03:23.159
Look down, dude.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.204
Look.

03:28.077 --> 03:28.991
Fuck you.

03:29.121 --> 03:30.340
You're disgusting.

03:49.707 --> 03:52.971
Do we have a rag I
could wipe this with?

03:53.102 --> 03:55.887
Or honestly, a whole new cup
would be a lot better, actually.

03:56.018 --> 03:57.802
No.
Just drink it.

03:57.933 --> 04:00.414
Kathleen just rubbed her whole
mouth on it right before me.

04:00.544 --> 04:02.329
- So what?
- So what?

04:02.459 --> 04:03.678
So I'm clean as a whistle.

04:03.808 --> 04:05.332
I'm not trying to
get herpes all over

04:05.462 --> 04:06.463
my thinking balls 'cause you
rubbed your dirty ass lips all

04:06.594 --> 04:07.072
over the fucking thing.

04:07.203 --> 04:08.596
Chip.

04:08.726 --> 04:09.727
Fine.

04:17.169 --> 04:17.996
All right, that's it.
We're done.

04:19.563 --> 04:20.869
What?
Come on.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.436
It was just a practice run.
Who cares?

04:22.566 --> 04:23.872
Punishment barn.

04:24.002 --> 04:27.571
I've been in the
punishment barn all month.

04:27.702 --> 04:28.659
Fuck you, Kathleen.

04:54.424 --> 04:55.904
Shut your mouth.

05:05.827 --> 05:08.003
Stupid raccoons ate all my
kettle corns and on-the-go

05:08.133 --> 05:09.134
desserts.

05:19.014 --> 05:20.015
What's up?

05:22.670 --> 05:24.062
How are we doing.
What's up, Gabe?

05:24.193 --> 05:25.107
Good morning.

05:25.237 --> 05:28.240
Good morning.

05:28.371 --> 05:29.981
Fuck you, dude.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.026
I'm just fucking around.

05:31.156 --> 05:32.201
Can I get some coffee or what?

05:32.332 --> 05:33.898
- Morning family.
- Morning.

05:34.029 --> 05:35.117
William.

05:35.247 --> 05:36.205
Good morning.

05:39.382 --> 05:41.210
Thank you.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.430
William-- hello and
good morning, Will.

05:43.560 --> 05:46.215
I was just wondering-- and you
know how I hate bringing stuff

05:46.346 --> 05:48.696
up over and over again, so I'm
hoping we can just settle this

05:48.826 --> 05:50.437
right now--

05:50.567 --> 05:54.528
I was just wondering if I could
have a gun or a long sword,

05:54.658 --> 05:56.225
like longer than what I got now.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.054
Because the setup now, dude,
is not snagging these raccoons

05:59.184 --> 06:01.709
and they are running buck
wild on my various oats

06:01.839 --> 06:03.754
and approved crackers.

06:03.885 --> 06:05.016
What's the question?

06:05.147 --> 06:06.191
May I have a gun?

06:06.322 --> 06:07.671
No.

06:07.802 --> 06:09.456
OK.

06:09.586 --> 06:11.632
Agenda B, is it possible to
get the generator in the mix?

06:11.762 --> 06:13.329
Because it might not
feel like it indoors,

06:13.460 --> 06:14.765
but when you're
sleeping outside,

06:14.896 --> 06:16.245
it gets pretty cold at night.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.726
And I would love to just
plug in the space heater.

06:18.856 --> 06:20.031
Are we hearing this?

06:20.162 --> 06:22.947
Somebody seems to
forget, after tonight,

06:23.078 --> 06:25.515
he's going to be kept plenty
warm by the Celestial Bosom.

06:27.648 --> 06:28.518
I know.

06:28.649 --> 06:29.563
I'm sorry.

06:29.693 --> 06:30.825
I'm fucking stupid.

06:30.955 --> 06:32.174
It's going to be
awesome, the Bosom,

06:32.304 --> 06:33.697
and I'm jacked for that shit.

06:33.828 --> 06:35.395
So rescinded.

06:35.525 --> 06:36.613
Request rescinded.

06:36.744 --> 06:39.573
Everybody gather around.

06:39.703 --> 06:47.189
So today is obviously a joyous
day, and we have so much to do.

06:47.319 --> 06:51.628
But it is Tuesday, so
you know what that means.

06:51.759 --> 06:52.542
It's--

06:52.673 --> 06:54.022
Ice cream Tuesday!

06:56.938 --> 06:58.592
I thought that it couldn't
possibly be Ice Cream Tuesday,

06:58.722 --> 07:00.289
but it is Ice Cream Tuesday.

07:02.944 --> 07:04.075
All right.

07:12.519 --> 07:13.345
Oh, fuck.

07:19.961 --> 07:22.529
All right, well, Elizabeth and
I are going to get ready to go

07:22.659 --> 07:26.533
to town and when we get back,
I'm trusting all of you to have

07:26.663 --> 07:29.274
everything ready for our
special night, mm-kay?

07:29.405 --> 07:30.406
Mm-kay.

08:15.625 --> 08:16.931
Guys.

08:17.061 --> 08:18.062
Guys.

08:21.805 --> 08:25.113
What a meal.

08:25.243 --> 08:28.856
Gabriel and Jefferson, that's
got to be in your top 10 stews.

08:28.986 --> 08:32.424
And a little birdie told
me there might be a cake.

08:34.165 --> 08:36.820
Yeah, but I mean, the
stew was so rich and good.

08:36.951 --> 08:38.866
I mean, cake on top of that?

08:38.996 --> 08:40.389
A little over the top, right?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.217
No, I don't think so.

08:42.347 --> 08:43.653
Time for cake.
- Yeah.

08:43.784 --> 08:45.437
No, I know, but I'm
just saying, like, we

08:45.568 --> 08:49.137
got the whole we're transcending
and we got the whole ceremony.

08:49.267 --> 08:51.705
Who wants to be, like,
bloated for that?

08:51.835 --> 08:54.229
Jefferson, would you mind
going and getting the cake?

08:54.359 --> 08:56.884
It would be my honor.

08:57.014 --> 08:59.103
Yeah, he should--

08:59.234 --> 09:00.104
he should get the cake.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.671
That's right.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.151
The only thing better
than a stew and a Cola

09:03.281 --> 09:04.935
is a stew and a
Cola and some cake.

09:06.110 --> 09:07.416
That's so true.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.549
He just-- yeah, that's good.

09:22.910 --> 09:25.086
Huh.

09:25.216 --> 09:27.523
Well, personally, I would have
made the cake a little bigger

09:27.654 --> 09:30.787
myself, but it is a
beautiful message, guys.

09:30.918 --> 09:31.832
Whee.

09:31.962 --> 09:32.876
Right?

09:33.007 --> 09:35.270
We're on a roller coaster.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.664
This life of ours, huh?

09:37.794 --> 09:39.579
Chip, did you eat the cake?

09:39.709 --> 09:41.711
For the last time, no.

09:41.842 --> 09:42.843
Outside.

09:42.973 --> 09:43.931
Now.

09:48.152 --> 09:49.763
I wasn't even
that much of fuck.

09:49.893 --> 09:50.807
I did a little bit.

09:56.900 --> 09:59.163
Clearly, punishments
don't work.

09:59.294 --> 10:03.907
So instead of punishing you,
I'm going to empower you.

10:04.038 --> 10:07.084
I had a task I had planned
to entrust to Jefferson,

10:07.215 --> 10:09.957
but obviously, now he
has to bake a new cake.

10:10.087 --> 10:11.045
Yeah.

10:11.175 --> 10:12.350
Whatever it is, I'll do it.

10:12.481 --> 10:14.091
I just need you
to mail an envelope.

10:14.222 --> 10:16.616
Are we sending a
bomb to City Hall?

10:16.746 --> 10:19.923
No, it's our tape that
we're sending to News Line

10:20.054 --> 10:22.534
to Georgeanne Jennings, to show
the world what we've done here.

10:22.665 --> 10:24.667
Yes, that's a beautiful
plan, and I will execute it

10:24.798 --> 10:25.929
to perfection for you.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.409
It's already
stamped and addressed.

10:27.539 --> 10:29.324
All you have to do is
put it in the mailbox

10:29.454 --> 10:31.282
outside the Snack-And-Go.

10:31.413 --> 10:33.720
Can I get a Mr. Slush?

10:33.850 --> 10:35.286
Once the envelope
is in the mailbox,

10:35.417 --> 10:36.679
you may get a Mr. slush.

10:36.810 --> 10:38.159
Yes.
Thank you, William.

10:38.289 --> 10:39.421
Thank you so much.

10:39.551 --> 10:40.770
I will not squander
this opportunity.

10:46.167 --> 10:48.343
I love crackers.

10:48.473 --> 10:50.127
It would have been nice.

11:00.747 --> 11:02.705
Would you guys like to
join me in the basement?

11:02.836 --> 11:04.272
I'd love to run
something by you.

11:11.845 --> 11:12.759
Fuck.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.674
Look Goddamit.

11:28.035 --> 11:30.951
Guys, bad news.

11:31.081 --> 11:32.996
Somebody tried to jump me.

11:33.127 --> 11:34.781
I fought him off,
obviously, but he

11:34.911 --> 11:36.913
did pour his slush
all over the envelope.

11:37.044 --> 11:40.264
We are going to need a new one.

11:40.395 --> 11:43.224
Hello?

11:43.354 --> 11:44.747
Where is everybody?

12:46.243 --> 12:47.244
Chip!

12:47.375 --> 12:49.725
Oh my gosh, Chip.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.248
My Chippy is home.

12:51.379 --> 12:52.293
My brother.

12:52.423 --> 12:53.903
Oh, my big baby.

12:54.034 --> 12:55.122
Oh.

12:55.252 --> 12:56.079
Hey.

12:56.210 --> 12:57.124
How are you?

12:57.254 --> 12:58.255
My son's home.

12:58.386 --> 12:59.779
Look at you.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.955
What the hell happened to you?

13:16.273 --> 13:18.536
Stop jerking off,
it's time to go to work.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.887
You want me all backed up
in the workplace, dumb ass?

13:21.017 --> 13:22.410
You need to learn
to cum faster.

13:28.155 --> 13:30.592
All due respect, Ma, how about
a fucking pancake every once

13:30.722 --> 13:32.289
in a while?

13:32.420 --> 13:34.291
Pancakes didn't get
your father, brother,

13:34.422 --> 13:37.077
and me losing over
300 pounds combined.

13:37.207 --> 13:38.774
Doesn't that motivate
you, make you

13:38.905 --> 13:41.429
want to make that
number 600, maybe 700?

13:41.559 --> 13:42.560
700?

13:42.691 --> 13:45.172
How fucking fat
do you think I am?

13:45.302 --> 13:47.827
How am I supposed to perform
at work if I'm operating

13:47.957 --> 13:49.567
in a caloric deficit all day?

13:49.698 --> 13:51.656
Ha, you mean clock in and
play Minesweep for eight hours?

13:51.787 --> 13:53.441
Is that what you're
talking about, work?

13:53.571 --> 13:54.790
Take a look around you, Chip.

13:54.921 --> 13:55.922
Look at this beautiful home.

13:56.052 --> 13:57.575
Look at the clothes
on your back.

13:57.706 --> 14:00.274
The certified pre-owned
Ford Taurus in the driveway.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.711
You think your father could
have given us all that if he'd

14:02.842 --> 14:05.018
been playing computer all day?

14:05.148 --> 14:06.280
The answer is no.

14:06.410 --> 14:08.369
It took determination
and the ability

14:08.499 --> 14:11.198
to sell the shit
out of some gravel.

14:11.328 --> 14:12.764
Your brother gets it.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.766
It's more than
just piles of rocks.

14:14.897 --> 14:17.117
Chip, I'm sick of
the excuses, kid.

14:17.247 --> 14:19.467
You either make a sale
today or you start

14:19.597 --> 14:20.772
looking elsewhere for work.

14:20.903 --> 14:21.904
Elsewhere for work?
How?

14:22.035 --> 14:23.253
I have no other skills.

14:23.384 --> 14:24.733
Maybe you shouldn't
have spent five years

14:24.864 --> 14:26.169
being a sumo wrestler in China.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.910
For the last time,
Mom, I was training

14:28.041 --> 14:29.520
to be a karate
champion in Tokyo,

14:29.651 --> 14:31.348
but the day before
the big championship,

14:31.479 --> 14:34.221
my sensei betrayed me and stole
my beautiful girlfriend, Akiko.

14:34.351 --> 14:36.527
I was too heartbroken to
fight, and that's why I lost.

14:36.658 --> 14:38.573
Doesn't anybody fucking
listen to me in this house?

14:38.703 --> 14:39.791
Enough!

14:39.922 --> 14:44.840
Make a sale today
or you're fired.

14:46.537 --> 14:50.063
Hi, this is Chip Harper
from Harper & Son Gravel.

14:50.193 --> 14:52.239
Now, it's your
lucky day because we

14:52.369 --> 14:57.548
have some incredible new deals
on some fresh, hot rocks.

14:59.028 --> 15:00.203
Well, I don't know.

15:00.334 --> 15:02.118
Would you consider
sharing information

15:02.249 --> 15:03.250
with a friend a threat?

15:05.034 --> 15:06.775
So you're saying you've
never had us out there

15:06.906 --> 15:08.168
for gravel maintenance?

15:08.298 --> 15:10.083
Your driveway must
look like fucking shit.

15:10.213 --> 15:11.998
You know, people are talking.

15:12.128 --> 15:14.696
They're saying, if that's
what the outside looks like,

15:14.826 --> 15:16.437
imagine how fucked
up it is inside.

15:16.567 --> 15:19.919
Yeah, your driveway is so
fucked up, an officer of the law

15:20.049 --> 15:22.573
believes you got junkies in
there shooting up, sucking,

15:22.704 --> 15:24.271
and fucking all
over your carpets.

15:24.401 --> 15:26.795
I need you to go into
your mommy's purse,

15:26.926 --> 15:30.103
take out her credit card,
and then just really slowly

15:30.233 --> 15:33.280
read me every number.

15:33.410 --> 15:35.108
It's 5 o'clock, idiot.

15:35.238 --> 15:36.631
You're fired.

15:36.761 --> 15:37.588
You're fired.

15:37.719 --> 15:38.633
What the fuck?

15:38.763 --> 15:39.939
I was going to close that.

15:40.069 --> 15:40.983
Saboteur.

15:41.114 --> 15:41.984
Serpent.

15:42.115 --> 15:43.594
Fired!

15:43.725 --> 15:46.380
I'm going to fucking
kill you, Cody.

15:46.510 --> 15:48.469
The disgraced
zoologist was eventually

15:48.599 --> 15:51.602
cleared of any inappropriate
conduct with the chimpanzee.

15:51.733 --> 15:54.301
For News Line, I'm
Georgeanne Jennings.

15:54.431 --> 15:57.217
What the fuck even is
this little round rice?

15:57.347 --> 16:00.742
It's called "quin-yo-oa,"
and it is an ancient grain from

16:00.872 --> 16:02.178
the jungles of Peru.

16:02.309 --> 16:03.527
The people who grew it
have never even seen

16:03.658 --> 16:05.181
civilization before.

16:05.312 --> 16:08.097
Our top story tonight,
a Grizzly discovery

16:08.228 --> 16:10.970
in an upstate cabin, as the
decomposed remains of five

16:11.100 --> 16:12.536
individuals have been found.

16:12.667 --> 16:15.844
The result of an
apparent mass suicide.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.803
A group of local teens
made the gruesome discovery

16:18.934 --> 16:21.371
after breaking into
the abandoned cabin,

16:21.502 --> 16:25.636
possibly to explore
one another's bodies.

16:25.767 --> 16:28.204
Authorities speculate that
this was a doomsday cult

16:28.335 --> 16:31.686
and have released this
photo found at the scene.

16:31.816 --> 16:34.994
Police asked for any information
regarding the red-haired man

16:35.124 --> 16:36.691
in the center.

16:36.821 --> 16:40.042
Police are also searching for
a potential seventh member

16:40.173 --> 16:44.046
of the cult as a mysterious
obese hand can be seen

16:44.177 --> 16:47.484
at the very edge of the photo.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.008
These bozos.

16:49.138 --> 16:50.748
What a bunch of dopes.

16:50.879 --> 16:52.228
That's probably for the best.

16:52.359 --> 16:54.752
If I dressed like that,
I'd kill myself, too.

16:56.537 --> 16:58.234
Yeah, that guy in the
middle needs to cut that hair.

16:58.365 --> 17:00.149
Pumpkin-headed bitch.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.846
I bet they're all
banging each other.

17:01.977 --> 17:03.848
I'm sure nobody else wants to.

17:05.285 --> 17:06.503
You know what?

17:06.634 --> 17:09.680
Five less freaks walking
around, if you ask me.

17:09.811 --> 17:12.292
What do you think, Chip?

17:12.422 --> 17:13.380
Chip?

17:16.296 --> 17:18.646
Chip?

17:20.561 --> 17:22.998
William, you fucking
piece of shit.

17:23.129 --> 17:24.521
I'm coming to get
you, motherfucker.

17:31.224 --> 17:32.486
You seen this guy?

17:32.616 --> 17:33.530
Nothing.

17:33.661 --> 17:35.054
Seen this person?

17:35.184 --> 17:36.490
Don't look at me like that.

17:36.620 --> 17:37.491
Shit.

17:37.621 --> 17:38.970
Oh, God.

17:39.101 --> 17:40.494
I'm so sorry.

17:40.624 --> 17:42.061
I thought you were this
guy that ruined my life.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.540
Well, obviously I'm not.
Jesus.

17:43.671 --> 17:44.846
OK, relax.

17:44.976 --> 17:46.065
You're really
milking this, lady.

17:46.195 --> 17:48.197
Hey, where'd you get that?

17:48.328 --> 17:50.330
It's none of your
business, you shit ass.

17:50.460 --> 17:51.418
God.

17:59.208 --> 18:00.514
Hey.
Hi, there.

18:00.644 --> 18:01.906
Yeah, hi.

18:02.037 --> 18:03.386
Listen, you ever see
this piece of shit?

18:03.517 --> 18:05.040
Yeah, I wish.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.303
I'd love to see a
cartoon in real life.

18:07.434 --> 18:10.306
No, it's a real guy.

18:10.437 --> 18:13.092
You know, he looks like
one of our old regulars.

18:13.222 --> 18:15.529
Yeah, bad guy.

18:15.659 --> 18:17.357
I don't think I
can prove it, but I

18:17.487 --> 18:21.187
think he stole our
birthday prize wheel.

18:21.317 --> 18:23.363
Yeah, I haven't seen
them in months, though.

18:23.493 --> 18:24.277
Shit.

18:24.407 --> 18:25.713
You know what?

18:25.843 --> 18:27.323
I wouldn't be surprised
if he was mixed up

18:27.454 --> 18:29.456
in that cult stuff in the news.

18:29.586 --> 18:30.413
Why do you ask?

18:30.544 --> 18:32.372
Are you a policeman?

18:32.502 --> 18:36.376
Yeah, I'm undercover, FBI.

18:36.506 --> 18:39.074
Listen, you happen to remember
this freak's favorite flavor?

18:39.205 --> 18:40.075
Oh, sure.

18:40.206 --> 18:42.817
Yeah strawberry?

18:42.947 --> 18:44.688
I prefer vanilla
myself, you know.

18:44.819 --> 18:46.647
Pal, listen, with
all due respect,

18:46.777 --> 18:47.865
I don't need your life story.

18:47.996 --> 18:49.954
I'm on an investigation, OK?

18:50.085 --> 18:51.652
So what I need you
to do right now,

18:51.782 --> 18:54.045
give me two scoops of
strawberry in the cone

18:54.176 --> 18:56.439
with sprinkles on the house.

18:56.570 --> 18:59.703
I got to get in the
mind of this freak.

18:59.834 --> 19:01.357
Can you help me
scoop the ice cream?

19:27.340 --> 19:28.297
What?

19:32.780 --> 19:33.824
Get the fuck out of here.

19:42.659 --> 19:47.186
Oh, balloons
for birthday parties.

19:59.328 --> 20:00.155
You fucking bastard.

20:00.286 --> 20:01.417
You fucking piece of shit.

20:01.548 --> 20:03.027
I'll kill you.
I'll fucking kill you.

20:03.158 --> 20:04.072
Eat your fucking nose.

20:05.508 --> 20:06.857
How could you cut me out?

20:06.988 --> 20:08.207
I don't know what
you're talking about.

20:08.337 --> 20:09.556
I'm Silly Billy.
- Oh, you're Silly Billy, huh?

20:09.686 --> 20:11.427
Well, I was looking
for my old pal William,

20:11.558 --> 20:13.168
but I guess I'm going to
have to kill a fucking clown.

20:13.299 --> 20:14.561
It's me, William.
It's William.

20:14.691 --> 20:15.997
- Is it?
- Yes, it is.

20:17.172 --> 20:18.521
Why aren't you dead?

20:18.652 --> 20:20.219
Why aren't I dead, either?
- I can talk.

20:20.349 --> 20:21.872
I just need you to get off me.

20:22.003 --> 20:24.005
I'm not going anywhere until
you tell me what happened.

20:24.135 --> 20:26.007
You were dead lying
with the rest of them.

20:26.137 --> 20:27.704
The universe had
another plan for me.

20:32.187 --> 20:33.057
Fuck this.

20:33.188 --> 20:34.581
I'm going to the cops.

20:41.675 --> 20:47.594
I did die, Chip, but I
was sent back to get you.

20:47.724 --> 20:49.030
To get me?

20:49.160 --> 20:50.031
Why the fuck didn't you
just take me with you

20:50.161 --> 20:51.250
in the first place?

20:51.380 --> 20:53.774
Believe me, I wanted
to, but the others

20:53.904 --> 20:55.558
insisted we transcend
without you.

20:55.689 --> 20:56.559
I was overruled.

20:56.690 --> 20:57.952
Bullshit.

20:58.082 --> 21:00.041
And I think, because
they had so much hatred

21:00.171 --> 21:02.086
in their hearts for
you, that they didn't

21:02.217 --> 21:04.088
return to Jalanzana at all.

21:04.219 --> 21:05.699
They went to Golgomorth.

21:05.829 --> 21:08.702
And because I had nothing
but love in my heart for you,

21:08.832 --> 21:09.703
I was spared.

21:09.833 --> 21:11.618
No, fuck that.

21:11.748 --> 21:13.141
You're fucking lying.

21:13.272 --> 21:16.187
Didn't you see me there,
dead, with your own eyes?

21:21.541 --> 21:22.455
Yeah.

21:27.938 --> 21:30.071
Why else would I be
back from the dead?

21:30.201 --> 21:31.725
I'm not a magician.

21:31.855 --> 21:33.204
I don't know.

21:33.335 --> 21:34.336
Maybe you had some,
like, unfinished business

21:34.467 --> 21:36.164
or something.
- Right.

21:36.295 --> 21:39.559
Maybe you had to fix the biggest
fuck up of your whole life.

21:39.689 --> 21:40.777
Exactly.

21:40.908 --> 21:43.432
You couldn't
transcend without me.

21:43.563 --> 21:44.825
We need each other.

21:44.955 --> 21:45.913
That's right.

21:46.043 --> 21:47.218
We need each other.

21:47.349 --> 21:49.960
We have to start a new family.

21:50.091 --> 21:51.658
What's that?

21:51.788 --> 21:53.486
You said it yourself, the
last one was full of snakes.

21:53.616 --> 21:55.052
They betrayed both of us.

21:55.183 --> 21:56.532
You weren't meant
to die with them

21:56.663 --> 21:58.447
and I wasn't meant to
sell fucking gravel.

21:58.578 --> 22:00.275
They sent you back for me.

22:00.406 --> 22:01.885
We get another
crack at this, dude.

22:02.016 --> 22:03.539
We're going to do
it right this time.

22:03.670 --> 22:06.586
With your knowledge and my
power, we're unstoppable, right?

22:06.716 --> 22:08.544
That's what you're
saying, right?

22:08.675 --> 22:09.980
More or less.

22:10.111 --> 22:11.547
And we're actually going
to transcend this time

22:11.678 --> 22:15.725
because we'll both be
leaders, co-leaders.

22:15.856 --> 22:18.424
Well--

22:18.554 --> 22:19.947
Or you could go
to fucking jail.

22:31.262 --> 22:33.569
Why are you a clown, dude?

22:33.700 --> 22:38.226
Well, think about it.

22:38.357 --> 22:40.184
I've been living in
the woods for a while.

22:40.315 --> 22:43.100
Eventually, I ran out of food.

22:43.231 --> 22:44.711
I have to go out,
so I figured nobody

22:44.841 --> 22:46.495
can tell who I am in this.

22:46.626 --> 22:48.671
So I go out.

22:48.802 --> 22:49.977
I get work.

22:50.107 --> 22:50.978
I get money.

22:51.108 --> 22:51.935
I get food.

22:52.066 --> 22:53.502
I go back to the woods.

22:53.633 --> 22:56.679
Kind of an ideal situation,
given the circumstances.

22:56.810 --> 23:00.204
But now the heat's
probably off a little bit,

23:00.335 --> 23:02.424
I'm kind of looking
forward to starting over.

23:02.555 --> 23:03.469
Dating?

23:03.599 --> 23:04.687
Who knows?

23:04.818 --> 23:06.123
Dating?

23:06.254 --> 23:09.213
Dude, they found the
bodies yesterday.

23:09.344 --> 23:10.954
No, they didn't.

23:11.085 --> 23:12.869
They found the bodies months
ago because once News Line got

23:13.000 --> 23:15.002
the tape, the police would
have went to the house.

23:20.834 --> 23:22.488
See, the thing about
the tape, actually,

23:22.618 --> 23:25.795
is due to circumstances that
were not under my control,

23:25.926 --> 23:27.884
I wasn't able to mail the tape.

23:28.015 --> 23:28.885
You didn't mail the tape?

23:29.016 --> 23:31.192
So where is it?

23:31.322 --> 23:33.673
Well, think about me.

23:33.803 --> 23:35.588
You sent me out on
this important mission

23:35.718 --> 23:36.806
and it gets fucked up.

23:36.937 --> 23:38.765
Not my fault. So
I'm running back

23:38.895 --> 23:40.984
to make sure everything
goes according to your plan.

23:41.115 --> 23:42.508
And how am I rewarded?

23:42.638 --> 23:43.944
So I'm pissed off.

23:44.074 --> 23:45.641
And I build a fire and
I take off all my stuff

23:45.772 --> 23:47.469
from the family.
I take off my uniform.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.558
I throw that in
there, my sandals.

23:49.689 --> 23:51.473
So you burned the tape?

23:51.604 --> 23:53.997
Yeah.

23:54.128 --> 23:55.042
Yeah, I burned it.

23:55.172 --> 23:56.435
I burned it.

23:56.565 --> 23:57.697
I burned the tape.

23:57.827 --> 23:59.742
You saved my
life, you know that?

23:59.873 --> 24:00.743
Really?

24:00.874 --> 24:02.310
Yeah.

24:02.441 --> 24:03.877
If they had that tape, I'd
be in prison right now.

24:04.007 --> 24:05.226
Holy shit.

24:05.356 --> 24:07.097
This is really meant
to be, isn't it?

24:07.228 --> 24:08.359
It is.

24:08.490 --> 24:11.580
Hey, I got something
I got to do,

24:11.711 --> 24:14.801
so I'll be right back
in just a few hours, OK?

24:14.931 --> 24:16.237
No way, dude.

24:16.367 --> 24:17.934
From now on we're going
everywhere together.

24:18.065 --> 24:20.023
We're going to be, like,
that type of twin that's

24:20.154 --> 24:23.462
like, two guys mashed into each
other, sharing armpits and shit.

24:23.592 --> 24:24.767
That's going to be us.

24:27.030 --> 24:28.292
I hear it's
somebody's birthday.

24:31.513 --> 24:34.211
Well, kids, my name
is Silly Billy,

24:34.342 --> 24:36.736
and this is my
partner, Pancakes.

24:36.866 --> 24:40.827
But pancakes is not allowed
to speak because pancakes

24:40.957 --> 24:41.915
is in training.

24:43.351 --> 24:46.746
So how did you
find these guys?

24:46.876 --> 24:49.879
Well, we had a
Power Ranger bot,

24:50.010 --> 24:53.100
but apparently,
his house exploded.

24:53.230 --> 24:54.841
And the skinny one
there, he's always

24:54.971 --> 24:57.278
giving me balloons in the
park so I felt bad for him.

24:58.409 --> 25:00.194
Hey, cakes fell off the horse.

25:00.324 --> 25:01.674
I have to give him CPR.

25:03.806 --> 25:04.981
- I got to piss.
- All right.

25:07.506 --> 25:08.768
It's going to happen.

25:14.643 --> 25:16.297
Actually, Pancakes needs
to go inside right now and do

25:16.427 --> 25:17.820
something else.

25:17.951 --> 25:22.129
So he'll do that and we'll
see what we got in here.

25:32.618 --> 25:34.097
I need to get in shape.

25:34.228 --> 25:35.055
I guess I'll jump rope.

25:36.230 --> 25:37.666
Oh, sorry about that.

25:44.194 --> 25:46.240
What exactly are you up
to down here, young man?

25:48.851 --> 25:50.200
Let's blow one up, huh?

25:52.942 --> 25:54.683
Oh.

25:54.814 --> 25:58.382
Dude, I know, homework
fucking sucks, dude.

26:02.735 --> 26:04.258
I wonder where pancakes is.

26:04.388 --> 26:05.302
Where's pancakes?

26:06.695 --> 26:08.871
Better hurry up and
get back up here

26:09.002 --> 26:11.439
and come back
upstairs right now.

26:14.877 --> 26:16.226
Look at the hot dog.

26:16.357 --> 26:18.098
Now, you see, a lot
of people think that,

26:18.228 --> 26:21.405
but the fighting is actually
the easy part of "ka-ra-tay."

26:21.536 --> 26:24.234
What's hard is the
iron lung discipline.

26:24.365 --> 26:26.410
See, not a lot of people
got the kind of discipline

26:26.541 --> 26:30.371
I did, but I think you
got it in you, kid.

26:30.501 --> 26:32.721
Thanks, Pancakes.

26:32.852 --> 26:33.809
Mister!

26:33.940 --> 26:35.158
Take it easy, lady, I'm high.

26:35.289 --> 26:37.073
You're moving so slow.

26:37.204 --> 26:38.597
What's happening?

26:38.727 --> 26:40.163
This woman thinks I'm
trying to fuck her son.

26:40.294 --> 26:41.251
I never said that.

26:41.382 --> 26:42.862
Good, 'cause I wasn't.

26:42.992 --> 26:44.820
OK, you perverts need
to get the hell out.

26:44.951 --> 26:45.778
Now!

26:45.908 --> 26:47.475
We are so sorry, ma'am.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.694
We will just take our payment
and be out of your hair.

26:48.824 --> 26:49.869
Payment?

26:49.999 --> 26:51.435
This lunatic gave
drugs to my son.

26:51.566 --> 26:53.263
Hey, he smoked me out.

27:03.099 --> 27:04.100
Are you mad at me?

27:04.231 --> 27:07.495
Yeah, I am.

27:07.626 --> 27:09.671
I guess we really
needed that 80 bucks, huh?

27:09.802 --> 27:10.672
Yeah, we did.

27:10.803 --> 27:13.719
That was kind of
the whole point.

27:13.849 --> 27:16.460
I guess we should
probably just give up?

27:16.591 --> 27:19.202
Yeah, I think that's the play.

27:19.333 --> 27:20.987
Yeah, maybe it is.

27:21.117 --> 27:24.773
Or maybe it fucking
isn't, you fucking dummy.

27:24.904 --> 27:26.209
Look at this shit, huh?

27:26.340 --> 27:28.734
There's 200 bones in here.

27:28.864 --> 27:30.474
Serves that lady right,
leaving her purse

27:30.605 --> 27:32.476
unattended in her own home.

27:32.607 --> 27:33.913
Hey, and that's not it.

27:34.043 --> 27:34.914
Huh?

27:35.044 --> 27:36.480
That's real gold.

27:36.611 --> 27:39.005
We came up with, like, 600
bucks just now, William.

27:39.135 --> 27:40.354
Cheer up, you little fucker.

27:42.225 --> 27:43.574
Hey, if you're
going to do stuff

27:43.705 --> 27:46.403
like that, though, you
got to run it by me, OK?

27:46.534 --> 27:47.317
OK.

27:47.448 --> 27:49.058
We're co-leaders now.

27:49.189 --> 27:51.626
You deserve-- you know, I should
never go rogue ever again.

27:51.757 --> 27:54.673
Co-leaders always
align, and from now on I

27:54.803 --> 27:57.023
will run everything by you.

27:57.153 --> 27:58.198
Starting now.

27:58.328 --> 28:00.026
What do we do next, co-leader?

28:00.156 --> 28:04.595
OK, I have a place we can go,
but we cannot show up like this.

28:04.726 --> 28:06.989
I could use a shower, too.

28:07.120 --> 28:09.035
Yeah, dude, you're
right about that.

28:09.165 --> 28:10.689
I didn't to say
anything, but you

28:10.819 --> 28:14.257
smell like an armpit took
a shit in a lady's pussy.

28:14.388 --> 28:15.389
You smelly stinky.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.655
I cannot wait to
get some followers.

28:20.786 --> 28:23.571
I think we need like
10 or 15 to start.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.530
We can start with one and
we'll see how that goes.

28:35.670 --> 28:37.933
Whoa, that guy looks strong.

28:38.064 --> 28:41.067
Yeah, but he's not
what we're looking for.

28:41.197 --> 28:42.111
OK?

28:44.897 --> 28:47.377
Oh, that guy looks
strong and cool.

28:47.508 --> 28:48.727
Not our guy.

28:51.817 --> 28:53.949
Who exactly are we
looking for here, man?

28:54.080 --> 28:55.864
Someone with a certain energy.

29:00.173 --> 29:01.130
That's our guy.

29:06.788 --> 29:09.269
13.

29:09.399 --> 29:11.227
Wow, look at you go.

29:11.358 --> 29:12.315
Excuse me.

29:12.446 --> 29:13.229
Sorry.

29:13.360 --> 29:14.796
Sorry about that.

29:14.927 --> 29:17.364
Oh, gosh, the Army sure
is lucky to have you.

29:17.494 --> 29:20.367
Yeah, well, they
actually decided

29:20.497 --> 29:22.456
to go in a different
direction today.

29:22.586 --> 29:23.544
Oh, no.

29:23.674 --> 29:25.154
Why is that?

29:25.285 --> 29:26.939
They said I have something
called celery bones, which

29:27.069 --> 29:31.334
is like where the bone is a
horseshoe style dead around.

29:31.465 --> 29:32.901
So I can't do it.

29:33.032 --> 29:34.598
Somebody as strong as you?

29:34.729 --> 29:35.948
And you even have the outfit.

29:36.078 --> 29:38.428
They say dress for
the job you want, right?

29:38.559 --> 29:41.170
They don't say how to dress
when you don't get it.

29:41.301 --> 29:42.389
About how old are you?

29:42.519 --> 29:43.869
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.
I'm Tyler.

29:43.999 --> 29:45.392
I'm 25.
It's nice to meet you.

29:45.522 --> 29:47.046
- It's nice to meet you, too.
- Yeah.

29:47.176 --> 29:48.482
That's a great
name, by the way.

29:48.612 --> 29:51.137
Tyler, I got to tell
you, if I was the Army,

29:51.267 --> 29:53.008
I'd make you a
five-star general.

29:53.139 --> 29:56.185
I appreciate that, sir, but
you are not the real Army,

29:56.316 --> 29:57.143
and they don't want me.

29:57.273 --> 29:58.144
Yeah, well, I do.

29:58.274 --> 29:59.580
I agree with William.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.843
I would make you like
an eight-star general.

30:01.974 --> 30:03.279
He's William, by the way.

30:03.410 --> 30:05.107
I'm sorry, I didn't
catch your name.

30:05.238 --> 30:06.848
I'm Chip.

30:06.979 --> 30:09.111
Well, William and Chimp,
it was nice to meet you guys.

30:09.242 --> 30:10.721
Chip.

30:10.852 --> 30:12.636
Well, it was nice to meet
you guys, but I don't know.

30:12.767 --> 30:14.203
I just have to go figure
out what I'm going

30:14.334 --> 30:15.335
to do with the rest of my life.

30:15.465 --> 30:17.772
So adios, I guess.

30:17.903 --> 30:19.600
Maybe we could
help you with that.

30:19.730 --> 30:20.775
Do you like bowling?

30:22.559 --> 30:25.171
Yes, I do.

30:31.525 --> 30:33.701
The balls are
fucked here, dude.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.269
So you guys are like a family?

30:36.399 --> 30:37.792
We're not like a family.

30:37.923 --> 30:40.142
We are a family.

30:40.273 --> 30:42.318
Except we don't have
the petty squabbles

30:42.449 --> 30:44.973
a family has because
we've chosen one another.

30:45.104 --> 30:46.409
That's right.

30:46.540 --> 30:48.716
No asshole brothers
barging on your privacy,

30:48.847 --> 30:50.457
dad threatening to fire you.

30:50.587 --> 30:52.938
No Uncle Aaron stuffing
you in a sleeping bag,

30:53.068 --> 30:55.201
not letting your ass
out, swinging you around

30:55.331 --> 30:57.159
like a sack of wet meat.

30:57.290 --> 31:01.250
And you're like,
screaming, like [screams].

31:01.381 --> 31:02.817
Help me.

31:02.948 --> 31:04.775
Let me out.

31:04.906 --> 31:10.172
And yet he doesn't let you out
and you nearly sweat to death.

31:10.303 --> 31:11.217
Right.

31:11.347 --> 31:12.914
None of that shit, no.

31:13.045 --> 31:15.264
And we'll fuck your
uncle up if you want.

31:15.395 --> 31:16.831
Oh, he was in chronic pain.

31:16.962 --> 31:18.224
He ended it.

31:18.354 --> 31:21.096
Oh, well, if he was
alive, we'd fuck him up.

31:21.227 --> 31:23.533
Even if he was, like, old
as shit or in a wheelchair

31:23.664 --> 31:25.274
or had one of those
fucked up little hands.

31:25.405 --> 31:26.667
That's true.
We would.

31:26.797 --> 31:28.060
Really?

31:28.190 --> 31:29.322
Appreciate that, guys.

31:29.452 --> 31:30.714
Gosh.

31:30.845 --> 31:32.760
Dude, you're going to
learn so much from us.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.196
It might be hard
for you to imagine,

31:34.327 --> 31:36.285
but I wasn't always
this good at leadership.

31:36.416 --> 31:37.591
William taught me.

31:37.721 --> 31:40.246
And together, we're
both going to teach you.

31:40.376 --> 31:41.203
That's right.

31:41.334 --> 31:42.552
Cool.

31:42.683 --> 31:44.076
We should hit the
road, but maybe you

31:44.206 --> 31:45.947
want to pick up a
change of clothes?

31:46.078 --> 31:48.950
Perhaps anything else
of value you might own.

31:49.081 --> 31:50.212
It's a beautiful thing.

31:50.343 --> 31:51.822
We share it all.

31:51.953 --> 31:53.912
I'm kind of in, like, a
transitional phase right now,

31:54.042 --> 31:56.915
but I might have a couple
things back in my place.

32:02.181 --> 32:05.271
I got to say, I'm not
really finding much here.

32:05.401 --> 32:06.576
Dude, speak for yourself.

32:06.707 --> 32:07.882
Look at this thing, huh?

32:08.013 --> 32:09.188
This will come in
handy the next time

32:09.318 --> 32:10.711
we need to send a
tape to the news, huh?

32:10.841 --> 32:13.018
Hey, Tyler, I had a
question about this.

32:13.148 --> 32:14.628
Is this gold?
Is this made of gold, or--

32:14.758 --> 32:16.021
Oh, chill.
Chill.

32:16.151 --> 32:17.718
That's actually not
mine to give away.

32:17.848 --> 32:18.893
Whose is it?

32:21.026 --> 32:22.244
No.

32:22.375 --> 32:23.550
No.
No.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.247
No.
No.

32:25.378 --> 32:27.641
You said you were
joining the Army,

32:27.771 --> 32:29.686
or going to Vietnam or whatever.

32:29.817 --> 32:32.907
You can't be in here with
a bunch of homeless people.

32:33.038 --> 32:34.691
You play with my
mind too much, baby.

32:34.822 --> 32:36.345
She's playing, guys.
She's just kidding.

32:36.476 --> 32:39.914
William, Chip, this is my
beautiful fiancé, Meredith.

32:40.045 --> 32:44.092
You can't call someone
your fiancé if they say no.

32:44.223 --> 32:45.964
Hey, guys.

32:46.094 --> 32:47.008
My name is Bo.

32:47.139 --> 32:49.141
I hope I'm not intruding.

32:49.271 --> 32:52.361
Meredith and I just had
a lovely steak dinner.

32:52.492 --> 32:55.495
However, despite the
food being delicious,

32:55.625 --> 32:59.673
it could not even hold a
candle to the conversation.

33:02.458 --> 33:03.982
Sounds awesome, man.
I'm Tyler.

33:04.112 --> 33:05.113
Pleasure to meet you.

33:05.244 --> 33:07.202
Thank you for
your service, sir.

33:07.333 --> 33:09.074
Meredith, have a
lovely night, but I

33:09.204 --> 33:10.292
think I'm going to go home.

33:10.423 --> 33:11.250
What?

33:11.380 --> 33:12.381
No.

33:12.512 --> 33:14.079
I'm not done with you yet.

33:14.209 --> 33:15.732
You're staying here tonight.

33:15.863 --> 33:17.865
Meredith, I think you
should know I'm leaving town

33:17.996 --> 33:19.867
to try and find myself.

33:19.998 --> 33:22.565
And God willing,
if I come back, I

33:22.696 --> 33:28.093
pray I may become a better man,
perhaps the men of your dreams.

33:28.223 --> 33:29.137
Leave the keys.

33:29.268 --> 33:30.225
Come on.

33:34.969 --> 33:37.232
Jesus Christ, dude,
are you all right?

33:37.363 --> 33:38.277
I'm fine, dude.

33:38.407 --> 33:39.582
What are you talking about?

33:39.713 --> 33:41.584
I'm chilling with
my new best friends.

33:41.715 --> 33:42.933
I'm having a good time.

33:43.064 --> 33:44.370
We should get going, though.

33:44.500 --> 33:46.067
It's about that time.

33:46.198 --> 33:48.287
Listen, we're about to go
on an amazing journey, right?

33:48.417 --> 33:50.332
We're going to go
see crazy stuff.

33:50.463 --> 33:53.422
Let me just give us
one gift before we go,

33:53.553 --> 33:55.642
a gift of hospitality.

33:55.772 --> 34:00.081
Tonight, why don't we
stay Casa Tyler style--

34:00.212 --> 34:03.780
sleepover right here, like
we did when we were babies.

34:03.911 --> 34:06.000
Going crazy sounds awesome,
but we do kind of need

34:06.131 --> 34:07.349
to get going.

34:07.480 --> 34:09.047
I'm not taking no
for an answer, dude.

34:09.177 --> 34:11.440
We're staying here tonight,
and we're going to have fun.

34:11.571 --> 34:13.486
And you're going to have
some drinks at my fridge

34:13.616 --> 34:15.618
and we're going to
play some games.

34:15.749 --> 34:17.707
We're going to have snacks.

34:17.838 --> 34:18.882
What kind of snacks?

34:19.013 --> 34:19.970
Dried fruit.

34:23.365 --> 34:25.193
Bring it on.

34:25.324 --> 34:26.890
You're really good
at this game, dude.

34:27.021 --> 34:28.109
Thanks, man.

34:28.240 --> 34:29.371
Psych.

34:29.502 --> 34:31.286
I'm about to blast
your little nuts.

34:35.334 --> 34:37.075
I've never played with
someone else before.

34:37.205 --> 34:38.076
It's so much more fun.

34:41.688 --> 34:43.472
Oh, my God.

34:43.603 --> 34:44.647
Oh, yes.

34:44.778 --> 34:45.605
Here comes everything.

34:48.999 --> 34:50.871
Guys, just remember,
if anybody asks,

34:51.001 --> 34:52.307
we're here for the conference.

34:52.438 --> 34:53.743
Nobody ever asks.

34:53.874 --> 34:55.441
Do you know how many
free hotel breakfasts

34:55.571 --> 34:56.616
I've got in my fucking life?

35:02.317 --> 35:05.929
When you make a wish on a
star, every dream in your heart

35:06.060 --> 35:07.931
might actually come true.

35:08.062 --> 35:08.976
What a joke.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.238
No, it's a song.

35:10.369 --> 35:13.023
It's from a movie
about the wooden child.

35:13.154 --> 35:14.851
I can't remember
the name right now.

35:14.982 --> 35:18.290
I can't remember the name of the
movie, but it was a wooden boy.

35:18.420 --> 35:21.075
And he taught me so many things.

35:21.206 --> 35:23.599
He taught me that if
you lie, guess what?

35:23.730 --> 35:25.297
Your nose will grow
as long as a hot dog.

35:25.427 --> 35:27.255
Somebody ought to tell
her that she'd better

35:27.386 --> 35:28.430
watch her nose.

35:28.561 --> 35:30.171
- Who, Judge Linda Booch?
- Yeah.

35:30.302 --> 35:31.738
Why?
What'd she do?

35:31.868 --> 35:33.566
I was just trying to
participate in the conference,

35:33.696 --> 35:35.307
you know?

35:35.437 --> 35:37.222
Yeah and I asked her a really
simple, straightforward

35:37.352 --> 35:40.312
question, and she refused to
answer in front of everybody

35:40.442 --> 35:41.530
and embarrass me.

35:41.661 --> 35:43.619
You see those women over there?

35:43.750 --> 35:45.969
They're in charge of
this stupid event.

35:46.100 --> 35:46.970
They also screamed at me.

35:47.101 --> 35:48.189
What?

35:48.320 --> 35:49.669
And they made
me leave the room.

35:49.799 --> 35:51.540
Well, that puts them
on the naughty list.

35:51.671 --> 35:52.976
Yeah, I got a
target on my back.

35:53.107 --> 35:54.021
I'm Tyler, by the way.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.501
It's nice to meet you.
- Hi.

35:55.631 --> 35:57.285
- Hey.
- I'm Diane.

35:57.416 --> 35:58.982
- Nice to meet you, Diane.
- Nice to meet you.

35:59.113 --> 36:00.332
Yeah.

36:00.462 --> 36:02.682
What do we tell Tyler
about transcending?

36:02.812 --> 36:05.119
I say we do it now and get
him pumped off the rip.

36:05.250 --> 36:06.120
Not yet.

36:06.251 --> 36:07.165
It takes time.

36:07.295 --> 36:08.383
You have to build trust.

36:08.514 --> 36:09.689
All right, well,
can we tell him

36:09.819 --> 36:11.343
about the Galactic
Palace of NamNam Jazar?

36:11.473 --> 36:13.040
No.

36:13.171 --> 36:14.650
The energy dolphins swimming
through an ocean of cloud?

36:14.781 --> 36:15.738
Not yet.

36:15.869 --> 36:17.218
The seduction of Bound Latham?

36:17.349 --> 36:18.698
The Ceremony of
Endless Beginnings?

36:18.828 --> 36:20.439
Why can't we tell
him anything cool?

36:20.569 --> 36:23.485
Let me lay it out for you
in a way you might understand.

36:23.616 --> 36:25.748
Would Colonel Sanders share
his secret spice recipe

36:25.879 --> 36:27.968
with somebody he just met?

36:28.098 --> 36:29.578
Of course not.

36:29.709 --> 36:32.059
He's famously tight-lipped
with regards to his chicken.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.669
And look how successful he is.

36:36.977 --> 36:39.066
Holy shit.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.502
Morning, ladies.

36:40.633 --> 36:42.548
You are all looking
very lovely today--

36:42.678 --> 36:45.464
for a bunch of snakes.

36:45.594 --> 36:46.769
That's my friend right there.

36:46.900 --> 36:47.770
That's Diane.

36:47.901 --> 36:49.555
That's my new friend.

36:49.685 --> 36:52.035
And she was just telling me
about your, frankly, disgusting

36:52.166 --> 36:53.820
conduct that you showed
her this morning.

36:53.950 --> 36:55.387
Vile.

36:55.517 --> 36:57.606
You are all being vile
to her, and that does not

36:57.737 --> 36:59.347
sit right with me, OK?

36:59.478 --> 37:00.870
So I'm asking you--

37:01.001 --> 37:03.264
I am asking you as
an American citizen--

37:03.395 --> 37:05.832
to go apologize
to her right now.

37:05.962 --> 37:07.660
No threat.

37:07.790 --> 37:10.010
I'm not threatening
you, but you must do it.

37:16.146 --> 37:19.585
Guys, this is Diane,
and I feel like she

37:19.715 --> 37:21.935
might be exactly the kind
of person we're looking for.

37:22.065 --> 37:23.458
- Hi, guys.
- Hell, yeah.

37:23.589 --> 37:24.894
Welcome, Diane.

37:25.025 --> 37:26.113
Well, hold on.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.332
The way you guys
were talking, you

37:27.462 --> 37:29.072
said this group is
all about community.

37:29.203 --> 37:31.118
It's all about helping
kindred spirits, whatever.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.467
- Yup.
- She's awesome.

37:32.598 --> 37:33.729
Right.

37:33.860 --> 37:35.209
It's just kind of
a vetting process.

37:35.340 --> 37:36.906
And I'm sure you're a
lovely person, but--

37:37.037 --> 37:37.864
Say no more.

37:37.994 --> 37:39.169
I totally get it.

37:39.300 --> 37:40.562
I don't want to be
a burden on you.

37:40.693 --> 37:42.085
I've been a burden
my whole life.

37:42.216 --> 37:44.740
Been pretty much a drain
on everyone I've ever met.

37:44.871 --> 37:46.394
It's all good.

37:46.525 --> 37:47.395
It's nice while it lasted.

37:47.526 --> 37:48.483
Bye, guys.

37:54.707 --> 37:56.491
Hold on.

37:56.622 --> 37:57.927
You didn't let me finish.

37:58.058 --> 37:59.668
We were just about to leave.

37:59.799 --> 38:04.238
And we just realized that none
of us know how to use a map,

38:04.369 --> 38:06.675
so we could use someone
to help us navigate,

38:06.806 --> 38:09.112
and we'd like you to join us.

38:09.243 --> 38:10.026
It's my idea.

38:11.158 --> 38:12.333
Oh my gosh.

38:12.464 --> 38:13.726
Yes.

38:13.856 --> 38:15.293
Hell, yeah.

38:15.423 --> 38:17.033
- Yes.
- Awesome.

38:17.164 --> 38:18.383
Awesome.

38:18.513 --> 38:20.298
I just have to do
one thing really quick,

38:20.428 --> 38:22.996
so can I meet you in the
parking lot in a couple minutes?

38:23.126 --> 38:24.171
- Yeah.
- Yeah, for sure.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.215
OK, cool.
OK.

38:26.347 --> 38:27.783
See you then.

38:27.914 --> 38:29.002
I can't believe it.

38:29.132 --> 38:30.003
Diane.

38:30.133 --> 38:31.134
This is awesome.

38:31.265 --> 38:33.311
Yeah, it's good.

38:33.441 --> 38:35.487
Cool.

38:35.617 --> 38:37.358
Dude, I saw what you
were doing back there,

38:37.489 --> 38:39.447
but I'm actually
awesome at maps.

38:39.578 --> 38:42.145
The thing you got to
do is follow the roads.

38:42.276 --> 38:43.146
That's a good trick.

38:43.277 --> 38:44.409
I know.

38:44.539 --> 38:45.975
I hate you.

38:46.106 --> 38:47.629
You're going to tell me
who's a good mother, huh?

38:47.760 --> 38:49.457
You think you know
everything about kids?

38:49.588 --> 38:51.807
Where did you get your
fricking law degree,

38:51.938 --> 38:53.461
from the Toilet University?

38:53.592 --> 38:54.854
Nothing.

38:54.984 --> 38:55.855
Nothing.

38:55.985 --> 38:57.247
Nothing.

38:57.378 --> 38:59.685
You don't know
anything about kids.

38:59.815 --> 39:01.121
You think you're Barney?

39:01.251 --> 39:02.905
No, you're not even Mr. Rogers.

39:03.036 --> 39:05.038
You're just a dumb, old bitch.

39:05.168 --> 39:07.214
Linda, look at me.

39:07.345 --> 39:08.998
Fuck you.

39:15.178 --> 39:20.836
So um, that was pretty
fucking wild back there, huh?

39:20.967 --> 39:23.012
What was that about?

39:23.143 --> 39:25.058
I know, I'm really sorry.

39:25.188 --> 39:27.234
I guess I should explain.

39:27.365 --> 39:31.020
So that judge, that little
bitch, decided to ruin my life,

39:31.151 --> 39:33.240
like, out of nowhere.

39:33.371 --> 39:35.721
And she wouldn't even reconsider
her insane ruling today.

39:35.851 --> 39:37.418
That's what I was doing there.

39:37.549 --> 39:39.681
Because of her, I'm not
allowed to see my son anymore.

39:39.812 --> 39:40.726
What?

39:40.856 --> 39:42.162
Not really.

39:42.292 --> 39:43.598
You know, I'm not
even exactly sure why.

39:43.729 --> 39:45.731
I used to do this really
fun thing with him, where

39:45.861 --> 39:48.298
I would take him
to abandon houses

39:48.429 --> 39:50.257
and I'd help him
through the window,

39:50.388 --> 39:52.825
and he'd unlock the door for
me and then we would sneak in

39:52.955 --> 39:54.217
and we would go exploring.

39:54.348 --> 39:55.262
He loved it.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.003
He really did.
- Wow.

39:57.133 --> 39:58.613
Then one day, we
went into this house

39:58.744 --> 40:00.615
that I really thought was
abandoned because it looked

40:00.746 --> 40:01.616
like such shit, you know?

40:01.747 --> 40:03.052
Really, really bad.

40:03.183 --> 40:05.315
But it turns out that
guy was living in there.

40:05.446 --> 40:06.578
Oh.

40:06.708 --> 40:08.014
And they took
him away for that?

40:08.144 --> 40:09.319
Basically.

40:09.450 --> 40:10.756
We set off some fireworks,
too, but I never

40:10.886 --> 40:12.627
would have done that
if I knew that somebody

40:12.758 --> 40:14.020
was living in there, you know?

40:14.150 --> 40:15.587
Like, I'm not that
kind of person anymore.

40:15.717 --> 40:17.240
I would never do that.

40:17.371 --> 40:19.721
Plus, my ex, Shawn's dad,
made up some really bad shit

40:19.852 --> 40:22.028
about my work
situation right now

40:22.158 --> 40:24.683
and the judge took his side,
even though I'm his mom.

40:24.813 --> 40:26.380
There's nothing
like a mother's love.

40:26.511 --> 40:28.251
He needs you.

40:28.382 --> 40:30.819
I know that was a
lot, so I understand

40:30.950 --> 40:33.039
if you guys want to pull over
to the side of the highway

40:33.169 --> 40:34.127
and dump me off.

40:34.257 --> 40:35.128
No.

40:35.258 --> 40:36.825
What?

40:36.956 --> 40:38.697
I know it's hard, but I
appreciate your understanding.

40:38.827 --> 40:39.611
We all--

40:41.743 --> 40:42.831
No.

40:44.224 --> 40:45.878
I love the way you handled
yourself back then.

40:46.008 --> 40:48.837
My family would never
fight for me like that.

40:48.968 --> 40:51.057
I remember when I
was a little kid,

40:51.187 --> 40:52.928
one time I was
wrongfully accused

40:53.059 --> 40:55.627
of stealing six bags of Reese's
Pieces from the J & F Market.

40:55.757 --> 40:57.367
My mom didn't take my side.

40:57.498 --> 40:59.239
She made me give back all the
candy to the old ladies that

40:59.369 --> 41:00.893
saw me take it.

41:01.023 --> 41:02.721
I wish I had a mom that would
destroy a Plymouth for me.

41:02.851 --> 41:03.722
Really?

41:03.852 --> 41:04.766
Dude.

41:04.897 --> 41:06.202
Yeah.

41:06.333 --> 41:07.290
Thanks, guys.

41:07.421 --> 41:11.033
You're really special.

41:11.164 --> 41:15.951
I guess my only thing is that
you did assault that concierge

41:16.082 --> 41:17.823
that pulled you off
of the judge's car,

41:17.953 --> 41:22.088
so I'm fairly certain that
the police are looking for us.

41:22.218 --> 41:24.699
OK, so they're probably
looking for this car.

41:24.830 --> 41:26.484
We dump it and steal a new one.

41:26.614 --> 41:28.181
Easy.
- That's perfect.

41:28.311 --> 41:30.096
Then we add grand theft
auto to the charges.

41:36.929 --> 41:40.019
Wait, I think I got it.

41:40.149 --> 41:41.803
I hate doing the ceiling.

41:41.934 --> 41:44.763
I mean, every painter knows,
like, doing a ceiling,

41:44.893 --> 41:47.548
painting the ceiling,
like when it drips--

41:47.679 --> 41:49.202
It drips in your
mouth and you get sick.

41:49.332 --> 41:50.203
Yeah.

41:50.333 --> 41:51.857
That's the worst.

41:51.987 --> 41:53.815
That's probably-- that's
got to be my least favorite.

41:53.946 --> 41:56.296
I think every paint-- if
you're a painter, you know.

41:56.426 --> 41:57.950
You hate doing the ceiling.

41:58.080 --> 41:59.952
Then you got that you
got to take a week off

42:00.082 --> 42:01.519
and you're bedridden.
- Yeah.

42:01.649 --> 42:02.955
And then you're
staring at the ceiling.

42:03.085 --> 42:04.957
You're looking at the
ceiling that made you sick.

42:05.087 --> 42:05.871
- That's a great sort of irony.
- Whoa.

42:06.001 --> 42:06.872
Whoa.
Whoa.

42:07.002 --> 42:08.177
Whoa.

42:08.308 --> 42:09.091
What the fuck are
you guys doing, huh?

42:09.831 --> 42:10.919
What are you doing?

42:11.050 --> 42:12.399
Well, we were
painting the garage.

42:12.530 --> 42:14.227
Yeah, no shit you're
painting the garage.

42:14.357 --> 42:17.099
You're painting my garage, and
I don't want my garage painted.

42:17.230 --> 42:18.144
Wait.

42:18.274 --> 42:19.754
Wait.

42:19.885 --> 42:21.364
When we were
talking on the phone,

42:21.495 --> 42:23.236
you were like, paint the garage.

42:23.366 --> 42:24.629
And you weren't as mad.

42:24.759 --> 42:25.673
No.

42:25.804 --> 42:27.501
What's the address?

42:27.632 --> 42:29.808
767 Maple--

42:29.938 --> 42:30.722
Maple Avenue.
Yeah.

42:30.852 --> 42:32.419
Yeah.

42:32.550 --> 42:34.029
It's yummy, like the syrup.
- It's yummy like the syrup.

42:34.160 --> 42:35.291
That's how we remember it.
- That's how we remember it.

42:35.422 --> 42:36.379
Yeah.

42:36.510 --> 42:38.860
This is Maple Lane, dickheads.

42:38.991 --> 42:41.341
Oh, fuck.

42:41.471 --> 42:42.777
- Shit.
- Shit.

42:42.908 --> 42:44.518
Yeah, you fucked up big time.

42:44.649 --> 42:45.519
You sure?

42:45.650 --> 42:46.564
Am I sure?

42:46.694 --> 42:47.826
It's my fucking house.

42:47.956 --> 42:49.305
Get the fuck out of here.
Go.

42:49.436 --> 42:50.698
- Shit.
- This has happened before.

42:50.829 --> 42:51.743
Yeah, this--

42:51.873 --> 42:52.787
We're sorry about that.

42:52.918 --> 42:53.701
- Sorry.
- No.

42:53.832 --> 42:54.746
No.
No.

42:54.876 --> 42:55.703
No.
Put that down.

42:55.834 --> 42:56.922
You don't take your stuff.

42:58.488 --> 42:59.664
You get your stuff when you
come back with white paint

42:59.794 --> 43:01.056
and you paint my
garage white, the way

43:01.187 --> 43:03.363
it was, the way my
beautiful wife designed it.

43:03.493 --> 43:04.669
- Sorry about that.
- Sorry.

43:04.799 --> 43:06.540
Sorry.
Sorry to you and your wife.

43:06.671 --> 43:07.846
Don't apologize,
she's gorgeous.

43:07.976 --> 43:09.021
She's an acclaimed
Pilates instructor.

43:09.151 --> 43:10.109
Oh.

43:10.239 --> 43:11.371
Yeah, it's fucking cool.

43:11.501 --> 43:12.502
Now leave.

43:25.646 --> 43:27.343
We got the crew.

43:27.474 --> 43:29.258
Who's ready to become the most
awesome version of themselves

43:29.389 --> 43:30.303
possible?

43:30.433 --> 43:32.044
Me.

43:32.174 --> 43:34.350
Yeah, we might be looking at
a couple of scrubs right now,

43:34.481 --> 43:36.614
but when we get
to William's, uh--

43:36.744 --> 43:39.268
William, William, tell
Diane about this place, man.

43:39.399 --> 43:41.096
Uh, well, it's big.

43:41.227 --> 43:41.967
It's on a lake.

43:42.097 --> 43:44.273
I own it.

43:44.404 --> 43:46.624
It might just be the
chrysalis from which

43:46.754 --> 43:50.453
we emerge our true selves,
a little slice of paradise.

43:51.716 --> 43:53.021
Paradise.

43:53.152 --> 43:55.023
Fuck yeah.
William's paradise.

43:55.154 --> 43:56.503
William's paradise.

43:56.634 --> 43:57.591
William's paradise.

43:59.245 --> 44:04.206
And now the sun
is shining all day long.

44:04.337 --> 44:07.949
There'll be no more clouds in
the sky,

44:08.080 --> 44:11.300
just the sun for you and I.

44:12.475 --> 44:17.132
Sunshine.

44:20.222 --> 44:27.534
There's only sunshine
waiting for you and me.

44:27.665 --> 44:34.106
It's all the happiness we
dreamed that it would bring.

44:34.236 --> 44:37.849
There'll be no more
clouds in the sky.

44:37.979 --> 44:41.983
No more wondering why.

44:42.114 --> 44:46.901
Sunshine.

44:58.608 --> 45:00.219
What's going on?

45:00.349 --> 45:05.006
Oh, just had to help an
injured moose across the road.

45:05.137 --> 45:05.964
Where are we?

45:06.094 --> 45:07.705
Why are you dressed like that?

45:07.835 --> 45:09.750
Well, we were all going
pretty stir-crazy in the car.

45:09.881 --> 45:12.927
We figured, fuck it, let's
stop and get some new threads.

45:13.058 --> 45:15.669
Went to a little camping
store, got decked out.

45:15.800 --> 45:16.714
Don't worry.

45:16.844 --> 45:17.976
We got something for you, too.

45:18.106 --> 45:19.412
What?

45:19.542 --> 45:21.893
You wanted to drive
through the whole night?

45:22.023 --> 45:23.155
Yeah.

45:23.285 --> 45:24.373
That's crazy.

45:24.504 --> 45:26.114
We need a little break.

45:26.245 --> 45:28.334
We deserve to kind of chill
out, maybe have some dinner.

45:28.464 --> 45:29.727
Huh?

45:29.857 --> 45:31.250
We stopped at a grocery
store, and guess what?

45:31.380 --> 45:34.644
We're going to have a little
barbecue, camping style.

45:34.775 --> 45:37.386
Our friend Diane here called
ahead, got us a great plot.

45:37.517 --> 45:39.171
She's a hell of a
negotiator, this one.

45:39.301 --> 45:40.912
Why didn't you wake me up?

45:41.042 --> 45:42.130
Well, come on, dude.

45:42.261 --> 45:43.088
You were out cold.

45:43.218 --> 45:44.916
We tried.

45:45.046 --> 45:48.180
I don't want to go camping.

45:48.310 --> 45:52.837
So basically, I think if
my dream were to come true,

45:52.967 --> 45:56.928
it would be to finally guess the
amount of jelly beans in the jar

45:57.058 --> 45:59.147
at my mall.
- That would be fucking awesome.

45:59.278 --> 46:00.670
That's a great
fucking answer, dude.

46:00.801 --> 46:02.281
- Thanks, man.
- Hell, yeah.

46:02.411 --> 46:03.543
How about you, Diane?

46:03.673 --> 46:05.414
Wildest dreams.

46:05.545 --> 46:08.461
Wildest dream.

46:08.591 --> 46:09.767
I would want to get a parrot.

46:13.292 --> 46:14.989
OK.

46:15.120 --> 46:16.295
That's nice, but come on.

46:16.425 --> 46:17.296
Think bigger than parrot.

46:17.426 --> 46:19.037
We can get you a parrot.

46:19.167 --> 46:22.127
Anything in the world, what do
you want your life to look like?

46:22.257 --> 46:23.345
OK.

46:23.476 --> 46:24.999
I've never told
anyone this before,

46:25.130 --> 46:30.700
but um, I would want to be
an actress in TV commercials.

46:30.831 --> 46:35.183
You know, like I want to be one
of those women by the shower,

46:35.314 --> 46:37.185
and they're spritzing
it, and they go, just

46:37.316 --> 46:39.361
look at that shine.

46:39.492 --> 46:40.928
Like that.
- Wow.

46:41.059 --> 46:42.321
But I could never.
I could never.

46:42.451 --> 46:43.626
Nobody would want me to do that.

46:43.757 --> 46:44.584
What do you mean
you could never?

46:44.714 --> 46:46.368
You just did.

46:46.499 --> 46:49.415
Yeah, I would buy $1,000 worth
of cleaning supplies off that

46:49.545 --> 46:51.156
pitch alone.

46:51.286 --> 46:52.461
You're a natural.

46:52.592 --> 46:53.680
For real.

46:53.811 --> 46:55.334
And if you're this
good now, just

46:55.464 --> 46:57.205
imagine what it's going to
be like when we transcend.

46:57.336 --> 46:59.599
What does transcend mean?

46:59.729 --> 47:00.730
I meant--

47:00.861 --> 47:01.775
I didn't say it.

47:01.906 --> 47:03.472
I said tan skin.

47:03.603 --> 47:06.998
When we tan skin at
William's paradise,

47:07.128 --> 47:08.216
there's going to be so much--

47:08.347 --> 47:09.957
by the lake, so much sun.

47:10.088 --> 47:12.003
And everybody likes
a tan actor, right?

47:12.133 --> 47:13.221
- Yeah.
- Hey, Diane?

47:13.352 --> 47:15.049
Diane?

47:15.180 --> 47:16.181
Would you mind going to get
us some sodas from the vending

47:16.311 --> 47:17.660
machine?
- Totally.

47:17.791 --> 47:18.705
Yeah.

47:18.836 --> 47:20.576
I hope they have grape.

47:20.707 --> 47:21.839
Diet grape for me.

47:24.972 --> 47:27.453
You like the tan
skin, right, dude?

47:27.583 --> 47:28.497
I've never been able to.

47:28.628 --> 47:29.629
My skin is like paper.

47:36.462 --> 47:40.074
They should put beer in
those, don't you think?

47:40.205 --> 47:42.468
Yeah, I guess so.

47:42.598 --> 47:44.426
I ain't never seen
you stay here before.

47:44.557 --> 47:48.169
I know because I'm always here.

47:48.300 --> 47:50.824
That's mine.

47:50.955 --> 47:54.828
You ever been in
one of them before?

47:54.959 --> 47:58.832
Man, it's like a
big car with a bed.

48:01.704 --> 48:02.880
I didn't catch your name.

48:03.010 --> 48:05.230
It's Gertrude.

48:05.360 --> 48:08.581
Gertrude, I'm going to
stop beating around the bush.

48:08.711 --> 48:12.411
I ain't seen something as pretty
as you in a long, long time.

48:12.541 --> 48:15.980
And even though you got the
name of a real old lady,

48:16.110 --> 48:20.288
I'd like to invite you onto
my house and have sex with me.

48:20.419 --> 48:24.336
My wife is taking care
of her sister this week.

48:27.687 --> 48:29.341
No, thank you.

48:29.471 --> 48:31.430
Bye.

48:31.560 --> 48:32.518
Door's always open.

48:35.825 --> 48:37.131
Thank you.

48:37.262 --> 48:38.132
Thanks.

48:38.263 --> 48:42.789
And you, William.

48:42.920 --> 48:47.576
Just in time, a little
soda to wash down these dogs.

48:47.707 --> 48:49.317
Hey, Tyler, you
got to double it up.

48:49.448 --> 48:51.058
What are you doing
with a single dog?

48:51.189 --> 48:52.668
I don't even know.

48:52.799 --> 48:54.018
You're embarrassing yourself.

48:54.148 --> 48:56.107
Yeah.

48:56.237 --> 48:58.109
What's the most hot dogs
you ever had in a day?

49:03.418 --> 49:04.376
Hey, look who it is.

49:04.506 --> 49:05.725
Yo.
You.

49:05.855 --> 49:06.856
What's up, dude?

49:06.987 --> 49:08.162
What is this?

49:08.293 --> 49:09.903
Somebody want to tell
me what's happening?

49:10.034 --> 49:11.426
Who is this?

49:11.557 --> 49:13.341
I'm Jim Smith.

49:13.472 --> 49:16.127
I'm part of the family.

49:16.257 --> 49:18.607
OK it's time we come clean.

49:18.738 --> 49:22.394
Earlier, we weren't stopping to
help a moose across the road.

49:22.524 --> 49:24.483
We were picking up Jim Smith.

49:24.613 --> 49:27.399
The family grows stronger
with another member.

49:27.529 --> 49:29.792
And listen, I know what
you're going to say.

49:29.923 --> 49:30.793
We vetted him.

49:30.924 --> 49:31.794
Don't worry.

49:31.925 --> 49:33.405
It's all good.

49:33.535 --> 49:36.756
William's paradise sounds
like a dream come true.

49:39.933 --> 49:42.544
Chip?

49:42.675 --> 49:43.806
Chip?

49:43.937 --> 49:44.807
What?

49:44.938 --> 49:46.505
Let's talk.

49:46.635 --> 49:47.549
I'm doing hot dogs.

49:47.680 --> 49:48.637
Now.

49:50.596 --> 49:52.511
Jimmy, why don't you
take over for me, buddy?

50:01.955 --> 50:03.000
You like hot dogs?

50:07.656 --> 50:10.442
This is not working.

50:10.572 --> 50:12.183
What are you talking about?

50:12.313 --> 50:13.488
I gave you a chance.

50:13.619 --> 50:14.968
I gave you the keys.

50:15.099 --> 50:17.144
And I'm doing a
fucking great job.

50:17.275 --> 50:19.103
You're doing the
opposite of a great job.

50:19.233 --> 50:22.584
You're doing everything I
said we should not be doing.

50:22.715 --> 50:24.325
You're building too fast.

50:24.456 --> 50:26.197
You're telling them about
transcending before they even

50:26.327 --> 50:27.633
know the teachings.

50:27.763 --> 50:29.374
You're spending all our
money on camping gear.

50:29.504 --> 50:31.811
You picked up a hitchhiker,
who may well be a murderer.

50:31.941 --> 50:32.812
Jim Smith's cool.

50:32.942 --> 50:34.074
You're overreacting.

50:34.205 --> 50:35.641
I really don't think I am.

50:35.771 --> 50:37.469
And you're not
going to like this,

50:37.599 --> 50:39.471
but I've made a
decision to demote you

50:39.601 --> 50:42.039
from the position of
co-leader of this family.

50:42.169 --> 50:43.040
You can't demote me.

50:43.170 --> 50:44.954
No, we're co-leaders.

50:45.085 --> 50:46.608
You don't make that
decision by yourself.

50:46.739 --> 50:48.262
I already have.

50:48.393 --> 50:50.569
No, fuck that, because
you forgot our arrangement.

50:50.699 --> 50:53.267
Either we do this together
as co-leaders or I take you

50:53.398 --> 50:54.703
to the cops.
- Oh, interesting.

50:54.834 --> 50:56.488
OK, yeah.

50:56.618 --> 50:58.664
Call the police and they'll
come and they'll haul me away.

50:58.794 --> 51:00.361
And then what do
you think's going

51:00.492 --> 51:03.060
to happen with all those
people when you have nowhere

51:03.190 --> 51:04.713
to take them?

51:04.844 --> 51:06.585
They're going to leave and
you're going to be alone.

51:06.715 --> 51:09.327
This is fucked up, dude.

51:09.457 --> 51:12.069
Hey, it's only temporary.

51:12.199 --> 51:14.332
We can reassess once we
get to the lake house.

51:14.462 --> 51:15.463
How about that?

51:15.594 --> 51:17.291
I mean, maybe
there was one or two

51:17.422 --> 51:18.901
things I could have run by you,
but this is fucking extreme,

51:19.032 --> 51:20.381
dude.

51:20.512 --> 51:24.733
Look, one day, when
we've transcended together,

51:24.864 --> 51:25.778
you'll understand.

51:46.233 --> 51:49.018
This is a song I used to
know in another lifetime,

51:49.149 --> 51:50.803
so I apologize if
I'm a little rusty.

51:58.811 --> 52:00.334
They woke
up in the dark.

52:05.905 --> 52:09.082
They learned to
walk in the dark.

52:15.915 --> 52:24.358
They sang their
songs in the dark.

52:24.489 --> 52:26.055
They didn't know the sun.

52:31.713 --> 52:33.933
She wandered from
the path they laid.

52:40.722 --> 52:42.463
Said, don't go,
you'll be afraid.

52:48.948 --> 52:49.949
I smile.

52:53.996 --> 52:57.565
Turn my eyes toward the sun.

53:34.341 --> 53:36.125
That's crazy.

53:36.256 --> 53:37.997
You go forever
and ever and ever.

53:38.127 --> 53:40.173
No.

53:40.304 --> 53:41.348
You're cheating.

53:41.479 --> 53:42.393
Traitor.

53:46.397 --> 53:47.746
Good morning, family.

53:47.876 --> 53:50.749
Good morning, William.

53:50.879 --> 53:52.054
Got you a cup of coffee.

53:52.185 --> 53:53.795
I thought you might
like some of that.

53:53.926 --> 53:55.319
Oh, thank you, Tyler.

53:55.449 --> 53:57.016
You're welcome.

53:57.146 --> 53:58.104
Thank you.

53:58.235 --> 54:00.106
I slept like a
baby last night.

54:00.237 --> 54:01.890
Oh, that's great to hear.

54:02.021 --> 54:02.891
Diane, good morning.

54:03.022 --> 54:05.067
Good morning, William.

54:05.198 --> 54:07.418
Uh-oh, you have a little
leaf in your hair.

54:07.548 --> 54:08.462
Uh-oh.

54:08.593 --> 54:09.594
Oh, no.

54:09.724 --> 54:10.943
God, it's so soft.

54:11.073 --> 54:12.031
It's like feathers.

54:12.161 --> 54:13.032
Thank you.

54:13.162 --> 54:15.643
Good morning.

54:15.774 --> 54:18.951
I got to say, you three are
brimming with potential today.

54:19.081 --> 54:20.866
Oh my God, thank you.

54:20.996 --> 54:23.085
I mean it.

54:23.216 --> 54:27.612
Ah, Chip, you
decided to join us.

54:27.742 --> 54:29.353
Yeah.

54:29.483 --> 54:31.964
You missed a really wonderful
discussion last night.

54:32.094 --> 54:34.271
Basically, we are all worms.

54:34.401 --> 54:36.011
Yeah, I know that one.

54:39.580 --> 54:42.017
All right, gang, I'm
going to hit the showers.

54:42.148 --> 54:44.106
Chip, why don't you go ahead
and start breaking down

54:44.237 --> 54:45.456
the tents for us, OK?

54:58.512 --> 55:01.863
Hey, Chip, dude, is
everything OK, man?

55:01.994 --> 55:03.865
Yeah, dude, everything's
fucking awesome.

55:03.996 --> 55:05.214
Good.

55:05.345 --> 55:06.825
It's just you seem--
you seem kind of down.

55:06.955 --> 55:08.740
What?

55:08.870 --> 55:10.176
Nah, dude, I was up all night
thinking about all the chicks

55:10.307 --> 55:11.220
I slammed, actually.

55:11.351 --> 55:12.831
Oh my God, that's excellent.

55:12.961 --> 55:13.788
It was fucking sick.

55:13.919 --> 55:15.094
That's so sick.

55:15.224 --> 55:17.009
It's just I'm
pretty sure I saw you

55:17.139 --> 55:18.663
crying last night at the fire.

55:18.793 --> 55:20.012
What the fuck, dude?

55:20.142 --> 55:21.143
Don't you ever fucking
lie about me again.

55:21.274 --> 55:22.101
- Sorry.
- I don't cry, dude.

55:22.231 --> 55:23.407
OK.

55:23.537 --> 55:25.060
If you saw anything--
and you didn't--

55:25.191 --> 55:27.715
probably what you saw was me
being sad because William's

55:27.846 --> 55:29.413
song sucked so much dick.

55:29.543 --> 55:31.066
I thought the
song was awesome.

55:31.197 --> 55:32.546
It rocked.

55:32.677 --> 55:34.243
Yeah, dude, you would
think some shit like that.

55:34.374 --> 55:36.028
You're fucking weak-minded.

55:36.158 --> 55:39.031
I just want to let you,
man, like, if you're hurting,

55:39.161 --> 55:40.467
trust me, I've been hurt before.

55:40.598 --> 55:43.165
I've been hurt in
ways that are illegal.

55:43.296 --> 55:46.691
But if you are feeling
bad, just let me know, man.

55:46.821 --> 55:47.735
I'm here for you.

55:47.866 --> 55:48.910
We're family now.

55:49.041 --> 55:50.347
Dude, I don't
need shit like that.

55:50.477 --> 55:52.131
I'm at the top of this thing.

55:52.261 --> 55:54.220
I've been here longer than you.
You don't help me with stuff.

55:54.351 --> 55:55.221
I help you with stuff.
- OK.

55:55.352 --> 55:56.614
OK.
I'm sorry.

55:56.744 --> 55:58.355
I've stepped over a
boundary, and I apologize.

55:58.485 --> 55:59.617
- Yeah, you did.
- I'm very sorry.

55:59.747 --> 56:00.487
I'm sorry.
- You fucked up, dude.

56:00.618 --> 56:02.315
- OK.
- Beat it.

56:02.446 --> 56:03.447
- I'm sorry for bothering you.
- Dude, you're slowing me down.

56:03.577 --> 56:05.013
- I'm sorry.
- I have an important job.

56:05.144 --> 56:06.275
Were you assigned a job?

56:06.406 --> 56:07.581
I don't know.

56:07.712 --> 56:09.191
No, because you're
not trustworthy enough.

56:09.322 --> 56:10.323
I'm sorry, dude.

56:23.858 --> 56:25.469
All yours, ginger dick.

56:25.599 --> 56:27.166
Thanks.

56:27.296 --> 56:28.602
Holy shit.

56:28.733 --> 56:30.909
Holy fucking shit.

56:31.039 --> 56:32.867
Three Balls Billy.

56:32.998 --> 56:34.478
How's that third nut, Billy?

56:34.608 --> 56:36.218
You must be thinking
of somebody else.

56:36.349 --> 56:37.568
Oh, bullshit.

56:37.698 --> 56:38.525
It's me.

56:38.656 --> 56:39.570
It's Robbie.

56:39.700 --> 56:40.484
Come on, man.

56:40.614 --> 56:42.050
How you been?

56:42.181 --> 56:43.835
You still hanging out with
all those busted theater

56:43.965 --> 56:46.533
girls who follow you
around, call you a wizard?

56:46.664 --> 56:47.752
Different guy.

56:47.882 --> 56:49.362
Come on.
Robbie.

56:49.493 --> 56:50.842
You're right.

56:50.972 --> 56:54.149
I shit in your history
book and smushed it shut.

56:54.280 --> 56:55.499
You've mistaken
me for someone else.

56:55.629 --> 56:56.543
No.
No.

56:56.674 --> 56:57.457
No.
No.

56:57.588 --> 56:58.676
I'm pretty sure it's you.

57:00.025 --> 57:01.243
Matter of fact, I was
just thinking about you.

57:01.374 --> 57:02.854
Saw a picture of a
fucking guy on the news.

57:02.984 --> 57:04.769
Thought it was you, but wasn't
sure.

57:04.899 --> 57:06.292
Had a lady's haircut.

57:06.423 --> 57:09.077
But seeing you here in
person, I think it was you.

57:09.208 --> 57:11.471
What's going on, man?

57:11.602 --> 57:12.777
That wasn't me.

57:12.907 --> 57:13.821
Oh.

57:14.996 --> 57:15.867
All right.

57:15.997 --> 57:17.651
I get it.

57:17.782 --> 57:21.568
Hey, I'd do the same thing, too,
if they were looking for me.

57:21.699 --> 57:24.179
Well, good seeing you, Bill.

57:34.451 --> 57:36.061
OK, everybody,
it's time to go.

57:36.191 --> 57:37.454
Time to go.

57:37.584 --> 57:38.846
Let's get in the car.

57:38.977 --> 57:40.108
Let's leave everything.

57:40.239 --> 57:41.849
Trust me.

57:41.980 --> 57:44.330
Tyler, I would love to invite
you to drive for us today.

57:44.461 --> 57:45.331
Are you serious?

57:45.462 --> 57:47.028
I am.

57:47.159 --> 57:49.727
And Diane, our navigator, we
couldn't do it without you.

57:49.857 --> 57:51.163
Please resume your position.

57:52.512 --> 57:53.295
OK.

57:53.426 --> 57:54.296
Leave everything.

57:54.427 --> 57:56.429
Let's go into the car.

57:56.560 --> 57:58.387
We won't need tents
where we're going.

58:08.789 --> 58:13.228
And we'll all have our own
bedrooms overlooking the lake.

58:13.359 --> 58:16.710
I think it's going to be a
perfect place for us to become

58:16.841 --> 58:18.103
who we were always meant to be.

58:46.566 --> 58:48.916
Hello?

58:49.047 --> 58:50.178
Aunt Bev?

58:50.309 --> 58:51.571
It's Billy.

58:51.702 --> 58:54.574
Sandra, is that you?

58:54.705 --> 58:57.098
Not too hung over
today, party girl.

58:57.229 --> 58:59.187
But you can hang
out if you want.

58:59.318 --> 59:00.449
You can use the bathroom.

59:03.191 --> 59:04.149
Aunt Bev, is that you?

59:04.279 --> 59:05.237
Who is that?

59:08.109 --> 59:09.546
I'm Billy.

59:09.676 --> 59:10.590
Is my aunt here?

59:17.728 --> 59:19.860
Honey, where you been?

59:19.991 --> 59:21.427
Where have I been?

59:21.558 --> 59:23.124
I mean, I've been
a lot of places.

59:23.255 --> 59:25.344
Where's my aunt?

59:25.474 --> 59:27.564
Honey, I'm sorry
to have to say this,

59:27.694 --> 59:31.306
but your Aunt Bev passed
about six months ago.

59:31.437 --> 59:33.482
She was sick for
a couple of years.

59:36.268 --> 59:37.965
I didn't know that.

59:38.096 --> 59:40.054
She cared for you a whole lot.

59:40.185 --> 59:41.055
You know that.

59:41.186 --> 59:42.361
Yeah.

59:42.491 --> 59:43.754
I mean, she was
my favorite aunt.

59:43.884 --> 59:44.929
She was my only aunt.

59:48.497 --> 59:53.198
And you didn't think to
call in, what, six years?

59:53.328 --> 59:56.897
Yeah, I should have called.

59:57.028 --> 59:58.377
Who are you?

59:58.507 --> 59:59.683
I'm Dorota.

59:59.813 --> 01:00:01.641
I did your aunt's
hair for years.

01:00:01.772 --> 01:00:02.947
Started getting friendly.

01:00:03.077 --> 01:00:05.253
When she got sick,
I helped her out.

01:00:05.384 --> 01:00:07.647
I miss her, I do.

01:00:07.778 --> 01:00:10.171
She was so kind to me.

01:00:10.302 --> 01:00:11.129
She left me this place.

01:00:11.259 --> 01:00:13.653
She didn't have to do that.

01:00:13.784 --> 01:00:16.525
She always said she was
going to leave me the house.

01:00:16.656 --> 01:00:18.832
She wanted to.

01:00:18.963 --> 01:00:20.181
You broke her heart, honey.

01:00:20.312 --> 01:00:21.748
How hard is it to
pick up the phone?

01:00:25.447 --> 01:00:28.450
Probably the prettiest place
I've ever been in my whole life.

01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:30.627
I knew two boys that
drowned in a lake once.

01:00:37.416 --> 01:00:40.593
Sorry, guys, this
is not my property.

01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:43.857
It's my aunt's, and she's
dead, and she left it

01:00:43.988 --> 01:00:46.555
to her hairdresser
instead of me.

01:00:46.686 --> 01:00:49.733
So this whole thing is over.

01:00:49.863 --> 01:00:51.169
Thanks for coming.

01:00:51.299 --> 01:00:52.649
It just wasn't meant to be.

01:00:55.347 --> 01:00:57.741
Wow, that really sucks.

01:01:01.527 --> 01:01:03.877
Chip, what are you doing?

01:01:04.008 --> 01:01:06.140
Chip?

01:01:07.533 --> 01:01:09.274
Hello?

01:01:09.404 --> 01:01:10.318
Ma'am?

01:01:10.449 --> 01:01:13.104
I told you to leave.

01:01:13.234 --> 01:01:14.801
Who are you?

01:01:14.932 --> 01:01:15.802
Oh, hi.

01:01:15.933 --> 01:01:16.803
I'm Chip.

01:01:16.934 --> 01:01:18.457
I'm friends with William.

01:01:18.587 --> 01:01:20.154
I'm not sure how
much he told you,

01:01:20.285 --> 01:01:22.635
but our group is really
depending on this house.

01:01:22.766 --> 01:01:23.810
Group?

01:01:23.941 --> 01:01:25.551
He didn't say anything
about a group.

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:27.118
That little shit
just came in here

01:01:27.248 --> 01:01:28.510
and threatened me with legal.

01:01:28.641 --> 01:01:30.425
Said he was going to
kick me out of my house.

01:01:30.556 --> 01:01:31.862
Yeah, no, that
sounds like him.

01:01:31.992 --> 01:01:33.864
He could definitely be
a dickhead sometimes.

01:01:33.994 --> 01:01:36.083
The thing is, though, me
and my friends just really

01:01:36.214 --> 01:01:39.130
don't have anywhere else to go.

01:01:39.260 --> 01:01:41.436
Whoa, sick piñata.

01:01:41.567 --> 01:01:43.700
Is that a beer smoking weed?

01:01:43.830 --> 01:01:45.266
Yeah, I made it myself.

01:01:45.397 --> 01:01:46.224
You

01:01:46.354 --> 01:01:47.791
Keep a really nice home.

01:01:47.921 --> 01:01:49.967
Anyway, it's just
we've been on the road

01:01:50.097 --> 01:01:51.664
just trying to
get here for days.

01:01:51.795 --> 01:01:53.448
And everyone in the
crew is so awesome.

01:01:53.579 --> 01:01:56.887
You have Tyler, who's this
tall, strong physical specimen.

01:01:57.017 --> 01:02:00.064
And Diane, she's beautiful
and nice and just trying

01:02:00.194 --> 01:02:01.456
to get her son back.

01:02:01.587 --> 01:02:02.893
And then there's
Jim Smith, who's

01:02:03.023 --> 01:02:04.721
a foreign man of some kind.

01:02:04.851 --> 01:02:06.374
We'll do whatever it
takes to stay here.

01:02:06.505 --> 01:02:07.375
We'll do your laundry.

01:02:07.506 --> 01:02:08.550
We'll cook for you.

01:02:08.681 --> 01:02:09.769
We'll clean.

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.640
We'll secure the premises.

01:02:11.771 --> 01:02:13.730
We just-- we just really need a
place to become our best selves.

01:02:13.860 --> 01:02:15.209
I'm sorry, honey.

01:02:15.340 --> 01:02:16.558
I don't think I can house
a whole crew of people

01:02:16.689 --> 01:02:18.386
I don't know.

01:02:18.517 --> 01:02:19.997
No, I know.

01:02:20.127 --> 01:02:21.607
You're right.

01:02:21.738 --> 01:02:25.611
It's just I owed it to
everybody to give it a shot.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:29.267
Thank you for hearing me out.

01:02:29.397 --> 01:02:30.572
It's a shame, too.

01:02:30.703 --> 01:02:33.358
This really is such
an awesome place.

01:02:33.488 --> 01:02:36.448
Is that a vintage Dorota
"The Destroyer" poster.

01:02:36.578 --> 01:02:38.537
Come on now, you're just
trying to butter me up.

01:02:38.667 --> 01:02:39.581
What?

01:02:48.852 --> 01:02:50.157
No way.

01:02:50.288 --> 01:02:51.942
Are you kidding me right now?

01:02:52.072 --> 01:02:53.160
Come on.

01:02:53.291 --> 01:02:54.596
You know who I am?

01:02:54.727 --> 01:02:55.772
Do I know who you are?

01:02:55.902 --> 01:02:57.121
I remember this exactly.

01:02:57.251 --> 01:02:58.383
May 9th, 1981.

01:02:58.513 --> 01:03:00.254
The Superdome.
You got fucked.

01:03:00.385 --> 01:03:02.126
The ref turned his back
and Marvelous Mabel

01:03:02.256 --> 01:03:03.257
hit you over the head
with a steel chair.

01:03:03.388 --> 01:03:04.563
Pinned you.

01:03:04.693 --> 01:03:05.651
She stole the
championship from you.

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:06.913
You should have been the champ.

01:03:07.044 --> 01:03:07.827
You got fucked.

01:03:07.958 --> 01:03:10.134
God, that thing was rigged.

01:03:10.264 --> 01:03:12.397
I hate to break it to you,
kid, they're all rigged.

01:03:12.527 --> 01:03:14.268
You had such cool moves--

01:03:14.399 --> 01:03:17.445
the Dance of Destruction,
Thigh Blaster.

01:03:17.576 --> 01:03:19.099
Come on, are you kidding me?

01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:21.101
That was a long time ago.

01:03:21.232 --> 01:03:22.581
God, you were so electric.
What's going on?

01:03:22.711 --> 01:03:24.017
Why are you here?

01:03:24.148 --> 01:03:25.453
You should be headlining
main events right now.

01:03:25.584 --> 01:03:27.804
Yeah, that was a
lot of fun, but nobody

01:03:27.934 --> 01:03:30.067
wants to watch an old lady
parade around next to nothing

01:03:30.197 --> 01:03:32.373
and crush a man's
head with her thighs.

01:03:32.504 --> 01:03:34.811
Well, speak for
yourself, sister.

01:03:43.645 --> 01:03:44.690
The hell is he doing?

01:03:48.215 --> 01:03:55.005
Oh my God, that was one of the
coolest ways I've ever busted.

01:03:55.135 --> 01:03:58.225
I'm not even close to
being done with you yet.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:38.875
Thigh-blast me.

01:04:42.356 --> 01:04:43.662
You like that little piggy?

01:04:43.792 --> 01:04:44.706
Yes.

01:04:44.837 --> 01:04:46.186
- Prove it.
- I like.

01:04:46.317 --> 01:04:47.187
I like.

01:04:47.318 --> 01:04:48.232
I like.

01:04:48.362 --> 01:04:49.798
I like.

01:04:59.069 --> 01:05:02.811
Holy crap, dude, it's so
cool that Chip saved the day.

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:11.429
Hey, everybody, I have
something I'd like to say.

01:05:11.559 --> 01:05:15.389
I've decided to step down
from my position as a leader,

01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:19.567
because I think we've
all realized something.

01:05:19.698 --> 01:05:21.700
Actually, I want to
get this on camera.

01:05:21.830 --> 01:05:23.571
William, what are
you talking about, man?

01:05:27.227 --> 01:05:29.795
I'd like to give
a toast to Chip.

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:32.363
He's the one true leader of this
group, and he always has been.

01:05:32.493 --> 01:05:33.712
To Chip.

01:05:34.843 --> 01:05:37.063
Let's go.

01:05:37.194 --> 01:05:38.935
Would you follow
Chip anywhere?

01:05:39.065 --> 01:05:40.327
Oh, without hesitation.

01:05:44.244 --> 01:05:46.899
Chip is an awesome leader.

01:05:47.030 --> 01:05:49.119
He got us this
beautiful new home.

01:05:49.249 --> 01:05:51.121
He's the smartest
man I ever met.

01:05:51.251 --> 01:05:53.123
Who was it that brought
you into this group?

01:05:53.253 --> 01:05:56.082
Chip, all the way.

01:05:58.084 --> 01:05:58.998
There you go, buddy.

01:06:01.783 --> 01:06:02.915
Chip.
Chip.

01:06:03.046 --> 01:06:03.960
Chip.

01:06:04.090 --> 01:06:04.917
Chip.
Chip.

01:06:05.048 --> 01:06:06.440
Chip.
Chip Chip.

01:06:06.571 --> 01:06:07.441
Chip.
Chip.

01:06:34.381 --> 01:06:38.168
"Dear Chip, this isn't
an easy note to write,

01:06:38.298 --> 01:06:41.214
but last night it
became clear to me

01:06:41.345 --> 01:06:43.825
that I shouldn't
be here anymore.

01:06:43.956 --> 01:06:46.828
I've always feared I never
had a real purpose here,

01:06:46.959 --> 01:06:49.266
and now I know for sure.

01:06:49.396 --> 01:06:52.704
I'm certain you will continue to
be a powerful leader to everyone

01:06:52.834 --> 01:06:56.099
else, but I know that
I'm not worthy to receive

01:06:56.229 --> 01:07:01.495
your leadership, and perhaps I'm
not even worthy of this life.

01:07:01.626 --> 01:07:03.628
Goodbye, William.

01:07:13.159 --> 01:07:16.380
Today we lost an
important man who was wise.

01:07:16.510 --> 01:07:17.381
He was brilliant.

01:07:17.511 --> 01:07:18.643
He was smart.

01:07:18.773 --> 01:07:20.210
But perhaps his
greatest attribute

01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:22.473
was understanding when
he was no longer needed.

01:07:22.603 --> 01:07:26.303
Yes, his greatest
masterstroke was

01:07:26.433 --> 01:07:29.567
knowing that to stand in the way
of the supernova of leadership

01:07:29.697 --> 01:07:33.745
I've become would have been
completely futile to this family

01:07:33.875 --> 01:07:35.573
that William abandoned.

01:07:35.703 --> 01:07:38.706
I promise to take us to heights
that he couldn't even imagine.

01:07:38.837 --> 01:07:42.754
And William, though you've
now transcended and are likely

01:07:42.884 --> 01:07:46.366
experiencing pleasures we
can't even comprehend--

01:07:46.497 --> 01:07:49.152
the Festival of
Endless Beginnings,

01:07:49.282 --> 01:07:51.589
likely seated at the
table of Garnatham

01:07:51.719 --> 01:07:56.028
himself, gorging yourself on
his fat berries and juices--

01:07:56.159 --> 01:07:58.335
we miss you.

01:07:58.465 --> 01:08:01.120
One day we'll all be
with you, William.

01:08:01.251 --> 01:08:03.775
We'll be where you are.

01:08:03.905 --> 01:08:06.430
And on that day, I will, of
course, maintain my leadership

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:09.346
position over you, but you
won't have a problem with it

01:08:09.476 --> 01:08:10.390
this time.

01:08:13.306 --> 01:08:14.699
To William.

01:08:14.829 --> 01:08:15.700
To William.

01:08:15.830 --> 01:08:16.701
To William.

01:08:30.323 --> 01:08:32.673
You're not allowed in Europe
but you don't remember why?

01:08:32.804 --> 01:08:36.634
I think it's a family thing
I did, we did, long ago.

01:08:36.764 --> 01:08:38.505
Where's your from?

01:08:38.636 --> 01:08:40.594
The middle of Germany.

01:08:40.725 --> 01:08:41.682
Wait, go back.

01:08:43.206 --> 01:08:44.511
Wherein my client,
William Davenport,

01:08:44.642 --> 01:08:47.558
was held captive
for years, forced

01:08:47.688 --> 01:08:51.823
to sleep in an unheated barn
by the leader of the cult, Chip

01:08:51.953 --> 01:08:53.346
Harper.

01:08:53.477 --> 01:08:56.567
This sick, depraved
individual forced my client

01:08:56.697 --> 01:08:59.831
to take part in a
myriad of twisted acts,

01:08:59.961 --> 01:09:05.837
including a group suicide
ritual, during which my client

01:09:05.967 --> 01:09:09.623
was finally able to escape,
only to be tracked down

01:09:09.754 --> 01:09:13.149
several months later by Mr.
Harper, who, at which time,

01:09:13.279 --> 01:09:17.370
threatened and forced
poor Mr. Davenport to join

01:09:17.501 --> 01:09:19.633
yet another suicide cult.

01:09:19.764 --> 01:09:22.984
Only through cunning wit
and the bravest of hearts

01:09:23.115 --> 01:09:28.164
was my client able to escape
this dangerous, disgusting,

01:09:28.294 --> 01:09:32.951
unregulated militia and flee
to safety, at which point

01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:34.822
he contacted me, Don Wright.

01:09:34.953 --> 01:09:37.129
At this time, we're going
to open it up for questions.

01:09:37.260 --> 01:09:38.957
Yes, beautiful woman
in the front row?

01:09:39.087 --> 01:09:39.871
How are you?

01:09:40.001 --> 01:09:41.351
He's fucking lying.

01:09:41.481 --> 01:09:42.961
He never spent a night
in the punishment barn.

01:09:43.091 --> 01:09:44.441
I knew it was too
good to be true.

01:09:44.571 --> 01:09:46.399
It's not.
What we have is real.

01:09:46.530 --> 01:09:47.705
I can clear this all up.

01:09:47.835 --> 01:09:49.097
You got to believe me.

01:09:49.228 --> 01:09:50.838
you guys got to believe me, too.

01:09:50.969 --> 01:09:52.753
A lot of that was
very concerning, man.

01:09:53.928 --> 01:09:54.799
Fuck.

01:09:54.929 --> 01:09:56.540
Oh, no, dude.

01:09:56.670 --> 01:09:59.238
Guys, I'll explain everything,
but we got to go now.

01:09:59.369 --> 01:10:00.239
Guys, we got to go now.

01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:01.588
We got to go now.

01:10:01.719 --> 01:10:02.981
I'll buy you some time.

01:10:03.111 --> 01:10:05.157
Y'all don't deserve
this kind of trouble.

01:10:05.288 --> 01:10:08.813
I can't get in
trouble with the police.

01:10:08.943 --> 01:10:10.467
You're a good woman, Dorota.

01:10:10.597 --> 01:10:13.731
I'm doing this for
them, Chip, not you.

01:10:24.568 --> 01:10:27.440
Oh, D, what are they
doing to you, baby?

01:10:35.579 --> 01:10:37.145
Guys, this way.

01:10:37.276 --> 01:10:39.496
Chip, was that all true?

01:10:39.626 --> 01:10:41.280
Is this a suicide cult?
- No.

01:10:41.411 --> 01:10:42.760
William is full of shit.

01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:44.762
He was the leader of
the old family, not me.

01:10:44.892 --> 01:10:46.111
Were you going to kill us?

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:47.591
No, of course not.

01:10:47.721 --> 01:10:49.462
When the time came, I
was hoping you would want

01:10:49.593 --> 01:10:51.551
to kill yourselves with me.

01:10:51.682 --> 01:10:53.292
I know how that sounds,
but it's not death.

01:10:53.423 --> 01:10:54.902
It's transcending.

01:10:55.033 --> 01:10:57.818
Is that what transcendence
means, killing yourself?

01:10:57.949 --> 01:10:59.777
It's about so
much more than that.

01:10:59.907 --> 01:11:01.692
There's so much bullshit here.

01:11:01.822 --> 01:11:03.476
When we transcend,
that all goes away.

01:11:03.607 --> 01:11:06.610
No dumb judge taking advantage
of you, stealing your family.

01:11:06.740 --> 01:11:08.351
No one to break your heart.

01:11:08.481 --> 01:11:11.005
You're just hanging out with
your best friends all the time.

01:11:11.136 --> 01:11:12.833
Doesn't that sound awesome?

01:11:12.964 --> 01:11:14.400
Best friends don't
lie to each other

01:11:14.531 --> 01:11:15.967
and they don't
manipulate each other.

01:11:16.097 --> 01:11:18.274
I thought we were supposed
to help each other, man,

01:11:18.404 --> 01:11:20.101
and make the best of
this life right now.

01:11:20.232 --> 01:11:21.581
We are, guys.
Come on.

01:11:21.712 --> 01:11:22.887
You don't get it.

01:11:23.017 --> 01:11:24.541
I know it sounds a
little far-fetched,

01:11:24.671 --> 01:11:26.369
and I didn't want
to tell you this,

01:11:26.499 --> 01:11:30.938
but I know it's true because I
brought William back to life.

01:11:31.069 --> 01:11:32.418
I'm serious.

01:11:32.549 --> 01:11:33.419
I saw him.

01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:34.942
He was dead.

01:11:35.073 --> 01:11:36.814
The old group, they tried
to transcend without me,

01:11:36.944 --> 01:11:38.511
but they're a bunch of snakes.

01:11:38.642 --> 01:11:39.686
They had hate in their hearts,
so they couldn't do it right.

01:11:39.817 --> 01:11:41.645
They all died.
William, too.

01:11:41.775 --> 01:11:43.734
They brought him back for me.

01:11:43.864 --> 01:11:46.171
We were supposed to get
a second chance at this.

01:11:46.302 --> 01:11:49.479
I was supposed to transcend
with a good family this time.

01:11:53.265 --> 01:11:54.745
Guys, I think we should
just go back, explain

01:11:54.875 --> 01:11:56.181
to the police everything
that happened,

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:57.313
and just pray for the best.

01:12:00.011 --> 01:12:02.492
All the things you
said is really crazy.

01:12:06.147 --> 01:12:07.366
You let us down, man.

01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:18.682
It's so sad how people
can lie to themselves.

01:12:18.812 --> 01:12:20.248
Could Chip hear himself?

01:12:20.379 --> 01:12:22.250
Some people can't
face reality even

01:12:22.381 --> 01:12:23.687
when it slaps them in the face.

01:12:23.817 --> 01:12:25.428
It's pathetic.

01:12:25.558 --> 01:12:27.168
I don't understand why all
these bad things keep happening

01:12:27.299 --> 01:12:29.910
to me when I'm doing so good.

01:12:30.041 --> 01:12:33.131
And I promised Meredith
I'd come back a better man.

01:12:33.261 --> 01:12:36.177
Let's hope she forgot
about that one.

01:12:36.308 --> 01:12:37.875
Wow.

01:12:38.005 --> 01:12:40.878
I hope this doesn't
come off really nasty,

01:12:41.008 --> 01:12:44.795
but when it comes to delusion,
Chip has nothing on you two.

01:12:44.925 --> 01:12:47.711
Diane, when are you going
to admit that your life is

01:12:47.841 --> 01:12:50.322
a result of your own choices?

01:12:50.453 --> 01:12:52.629
And, Tyler, no
matter how much you

01:12:52.759 --> 01:12:55.066
don't want your
relationship to be over,

01:12:55.196 --> 01:12:57.373
you have to face the facts.

01:12:57.503 --> 01:12:59.940
She's just not that
into you, dude.

01:13:00.071 --> 01:13:02.987
Then again, who am I to judge?

01:13:03.117 --> 01:13:05.381
When I first met you
guys, I was still

01:13:05.511 --> 01:13:08.384
reeling from losing my
position within the ranks

01:13:08.514 --> 01:13:10.777
of a top secret
government program.

01:13:10.908 --> 01:13:12.997
After a failed
assassination attempt

01:13:13.127 --> 01:13:16.783
on the Vice Premier of
Morocco, I was shot four times

01:13:16.914 --> 01:13:20.961
and left for dead
in the Aegean Sea.

01:13:21.092 --> 01:13:23.703
Thanks only to the
kindness of the fishermen,

01:13:23.834 --> 01:13:26.663
whose nets lifted my
near lifeless body

01:13:26.793 --> 01:13:30.493
from the frothy
waters, did I survive.

01:13:30.623 --> 01:13:33.583
I heard rumors of a
false flag terrorist

01:13:33.713 --> 01:13:38.588
attack being coordinated by the
United States and Saudi Arabia.

01:13:38.718 --> 01:13:42.505
I was hitchhiking to Wyoming,
planning to execute vice

01:13:42.635 --> 01:13:45.856
presidential candidate
Richard Cheney,

01:13:45.986 --> 01:13:50.861
who my sources indicate is the
chief architect of this plot.

01:13:50.991 --> 01:13:55.735
But after just a few hours with
you guys, I felt so foolish.

01:13:55.866 --> 01:14:01.045
I realized I've been wasting my
life committing violence so I

01:14:01.175 --> 01:14:03.177
could feel a sense of purpose.

01:14:03.308 --> 01:14:06.877
I realized that hanging out
with cool friends, that's all I

01:14:07.007 --> 01:14:08.400
really need.

01:14:08.531 --> 01:14:13.797
This family taught
me to love again.

01:14:13.927 --> 01:14:16.756
But now it seems like
it's falling apart,

01:14:16.887 --> 01:14:21.718
and there's nothing we
can do, and it sucks.

01:14:21.848 --> 01:14:23.894
Jim Smith is right,
except for I do

01:14:24.024 --> 01:14:26.157
think you're wrong
about one thing.

01:14:26.287 --> 01:14:27.637
You are wrong about
the fact that we

01:14:27.767 --> 01:14:29.900
can't do anything about this.

01:14:30.030 --> 01:14:33.686
Chip might be all messed
up in the head, but listen,

01:14:33.817 --> 01:14:39.779
he's our friend, OK, and I
think we got to go back for him.

01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:40.867
Let's do this thing.

01:14:44.088 --> 01:14:45.045
Chip!

01:14:45.176 --> 01:14:47.526
Where are you, buddy?

01:14:47.657 --> 01:14:50.790
Yeah, come on, man.

01:14:50.921 --> 01:14:51.791
Chip?

01:14:51.922 --> 01:14:53.053
Chip?

01:14:53.184 --> 01:14:54.272
Chip, I'm coming
for you, buddy.

01:14:54.402 --> 01:14:56.317
Oh my God, Chip!

01:15:00.974 --> 01:15:01.801
Chip, dude.

01:15:01.932 --> 01:15:03.586
Com, On, man.
I got you.

01:15:03.716 --> 01:15:04.717
I got you.

01:15:04.848 --> 01:15:06.110
Dude.

01:15:09.635 --> 01:15:10.549
Fuck!

01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:11.681
Where the fuck am I?

01:15:12.856 --> 01:15:13.857
We brought you back, Betty.

01:15:13.987 --> 01:15:14.901
What?

01:15:15.032 --> 01:15:16.207
Why?

01:15:16.337 --> 01:15:17.861
I screwed you guys big time.

01:15:17.991 --> 01:15:19.950
You guys sold
some bogus, dude.

01:15:20.080 --> 01:15:21.865
We figured you could use
some help sorting out

01:15:21.995 --> 01:15:23.693
the bad from the good.

01:15:23.823 --> 01:15:25.390
You guys are the best.

01:15:25.521 --> 01:15:27.348
When I was just dead right
now, nothing fucking cool

01:15:27.479 --> 01:15:28.262
happened at all.

01:15:28.393 --> 01:15:30.003
It fucking sucked.

01:15:30.134 --> 01:15:33.093
I didn't just grow wings and
fly on the Celestial Orbit.

01:15:33.224 --> 01:15:38.098
I didn't get the fucking crown
jewels of Princess Namaharnomor.

01:15:38.229 --> 01:15:39.752
I believed William's bullshit.

01:15:39.883 --> 01:15:41.711
He fucked my head up so bad.

01:15:41.841 --> 01:15:44.757
And then I was so charming
and seductive when you met me,

01:15:44.888 --> 01:15:47.760
I fucked your heads up bad.

01:15:47.891 --> 01:15:49.762
I almost lost you guys.

01:15:49.893 --> 01:15:51.982
I'm not going to
let it happen again.

01:15:52.112 --> 01:15:53.897
Now that you've passed my test--

01:15:54.027 --> 01:15:54.898
Chip.

01:15:55.028 --> 01:15:56.639
OK, I'm sorry.

01:15:56.769 --> 01:15:59.772
Now that you've saved my life,
I'm very appreciative for you.

01:15:59.903 --> 01:16:01.905
I'm going to repay the favor.

01:16:02.035 --> 01:16:03.950
I'm going to save your lives.

01:16:04.081 --> 01:16:08.128
I know how we can
clear our names.

01:16:08.259 --> 01:16:10.566
OK, so with that
last call, the night

01:16:10.696 --> 01:16:12.350
before we were all
going to kill ourselves,

01:16:12.480 --> 01:16:14.570
William made us do
this fucked up tape.

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.006
OK.

01:16:16.136 --> 01:16:17.790
So on this tape,
that motherfucker

01:16:17.921 --> 01:16:19.357
is clearly the leader.

01:16:19.487 --> 01:16:20.793
He's admitting himself.

01:16:20.924 --> 01:16:23.143
He wants the whole
world to know.

01:16:23.274 --> 01:16:24.101
Where's the tape now?

01:16:28.584 --> 01:16:31.499
The important thing is William
thinks I burned the tape.

01:16:31.630 --> 01:16:33.589
He thinks all the
evidence is gone.

01:16:33.719 --> 01:16:35.025
But I didn't burn it.

01:16:35.155 --> 01:16:37.114
As embarrassed as
I am about it now,

01:16:37.244 --> 01:16:39.682
I just couldn't bring myself
to destroy those memories.

01:16:39.812 --> 01:16:41.031
Now the bad news is--
- Fore!

01:16:41.161 --> 01:16:42.423
Fuck.

01:16:42.554 --> 01:16:44.730
You see, the problem is
that tape is all the way

01:16:44.861 --> 01:16:46.471
the fuck back at that
first house where

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:48.647
William brainwashed me.

01:16:48.778 --> 01:16:50.257
So that's, like, really far.

01:16:50.388 --> 01:16:52.129
If you're dicking
around, yeah, it is.

01:16:52.259 --> 01:16:53.783
But if we drive
straight through--

01:16:53.913 --> 01:16:56.307
no stopping for hotel
breakfast, no video games,

01:16:56.437 --> 01:16:59.440
no hitchhikers-- we can get
there in less than a day.

01:16:59.571 --> 01:17:02.792
We just need a
real set of wheels.

01:17:02.922 --> 01:17:03.836
Oh, I have an idea.

01:17:12.192 --> 01:17:15.500
Well, well, who
do we have here?

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:18.372
I was wondering if that offer
for sex while your wife's away

01:17:18.503 --> 01:17:19.504
still stands?

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:21.071
You're just in time, Gertrude.

01:17:21.201 --> 01:17:23.203
My sister-in-law's
back on solid food.

01:17:23.334 --> 01:17:25.510
Means the missus will
be back any day now.

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:27.294
I just have one problem.

01:17:27.425 --> 01:17:29.035
I need to do it outside.

01:17:29.166 --> 01:17:31.211
It's the only way
that I like it.

01:17:31.342 --> 01:17:33.474
It's beautiful and natural.

01:17:33.605 --> 01:17:35.476
Just the right amount
of nodding, you know?

01:17:35.607 --> 01:17:37.478
Oh, girl, careful now.

01:17:37.609 --> 01:17:39.306
If I'm boned up, you'll
give me the shoot

01:17:39.437 --> 01:17:41.091
right here where I stand.

01:17:41.221 --> 01:17:42.440
Uh-oh.

01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:44.311
Come and get me before
I change my mind.

01:17:46.879 --> 01:17:49.882
Good things do
happen to good people.

01:17:56.193 --> 01:17:58.586
Hey, that's my
grandmother's RV.

01:17:58.717 --> 01:17:59.457
Hey.

01:17:59.587 --> 01:18:01.372
Hey.

01:18:01.502 --> 01:18:04.070
The gravel has scraped my penis.

01:18:16.517 --> 01:18:20.608
Behind me stands what most
would call a normal-looking home

01:18:20.739 --> 01:18:23.350
just outside a sleepy
Midwestern town.

01:18:23.481 --> 01:18:28.181
But within those walls, it
was anything but normal.

01:18:28.312 --> 01:18:31.184
Meet Billy Davenport,
an innocent man

01:18:31.315 --> 01:18:34.013
who fell under the spell
of one of the world's most

01:18:34.144 --> 01:18:36.450
depraved criminals.

01:18:36.581 --> 01:18:39.323
It's honestly a
little uncomfortable

01:18:39.453 --> 01:18:41.629
being back this
close to the house.

01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:44.110
And why is that?

01:18:44.241 --> 01:18:47.897
I can still hear
Chip screaming at me.

01:18:48.027 --> 01:18:49.333
But maybe that was the allure.

01:18:49.463 --> 01:18:51.727
The more he pulled
away, the more

01:18:51.857 --> 01:18:54.251
I felt the need to prove
myself because he was just

01:18:54.381 --> 01:18:56.993
so charming and special.

01:18:57.123 --> 01:19:00.257
Billy was talking
about Chip Harper, a.k.a.

01:19:00.387 --> 01:19:03.695
the Manson of the Midwest and
leader of the suicide cult

01:19:03.826 --> 01:19:06.132
known as The Cosmic Dynasty.

01:19:09.179 --> 01:19:11.442
How did you first
meet Chip Harper?

01:19:11.572 --> 01:19:13.313
Well, I was very
fat at the time,

01:19:13.444 --> 01:19:15.881
and I was in a fast
food restaurant arguing

01:19:16.012 --> 01:19:17.883
with one of the workers
about the amount of food

01:19:18.014 --> 01:19:19.450
I'd been given.

01:19:19.580 --> 01:19:22.496
I was insisting that they
hadn't given me my order,

01:19:22.627 --> 01:19:25.673
even though I'd already eaten
all the sandwiches in question.

01:19:25.804 --> 01:19:29.373
Chip saw my desperation
and pounced.

01:19:29.503 --> 01:19:33.986
What do you think Chip
thought when he first saw you?

01:19:34.117 --> 01:19:37.685
If I had to
speculate, hey here's

01:19:37.816 --> 01:19:41.777
a guy I can get to do all the
menial, degrading tasks that I

01:19:41.907 --> 01:19:44.214
am to relieve my
followers of, in the hopes

01:19:44.344 --> 01:19:47.304
that they'll fall more
deeply in love with me.

01:19:47.434 --> 01:19:50.829
If I had to guess, that's it.

01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:52.918
Wait.

01:19:53.049 --> 01:19:54.572
Why is that news van here?

01:19:54.702 --> 01:19:55.791
What's going on?

01:19:59.011 --> 01:20:00.665
Fuck, he's here.

01:20:00.796 --> 01:20:03.146
That piece of shit is here, and
he brought Georgeanne Jennings

01:20:03.276 --> 01:20:05.017
here.

01:20:05.148 --> 01:20:06.714
He's probably in there telling
her a bunch of lies about us

01:20:06.845 --> 01:20:08.281
right now.

01:20:08.412 --> 01:20:09.848
No, hold on.

01:20:09.979 --> 01:20:12.546
We're fine, because
the tape's in the barn.

01:20:12.677 --> 01:20:14.635
He doesn't know about the barn.

01:20:14.766 --> 01:20:18.204
As long as he doesn't take
her to the barn, we're golden.

01:20:18.335 --> 01:20:22.992
He wanted to show me the barn,
far away from the house, where

01:20:23.122 --> 01:20:26.169
he was forced to sleep,
often without electricity,

01:20:26.299 --> 01:20:30.216
left to deal with the
elements and the wildlife.

01:20:30.347 --> 01:20:31.348
Fuck!

01:20:31.478 --> 01:20:33.176
They're going to the barn.

01:20:33.306 --> 01:20:36.048
Oh, fuck, I'm going to
fucking jail forever.

01:20:36.179 --> 01:20:38.572
No.

01:20:38.703 --> 01:20:40.009
No.

01:20:40.139 --> 01:20:41.358
I'm going to get there.

01:20:41.488 --> 01:20:46.319
William, consider
your ass plucked.

01:20:46.450 --> 01:20:50.933
Did you ever
think about leaving?

01:20:51.063 --> 01:20:53.500
I was too stupid
to go anywhere else.

01:20:58.462 --> 01:21:00.507
And to tell you the
truth, I've blocked

01:21:00.638 --> 01:21:03.032
a lot of memories
of this place out

01:21:03.162 --> 01:21:04.816
on account of all
the trauma, but I

01:21:04.947 --> 01:21:07.993
will do my best to answer
any questions you may have.

01:21:08.124 --> 01:21:10.474
Did you ever
have sex with Chip?

01:21:10.604 --> 01:21:12.258
Stop!
No.

01:21:12.389 --> 01:21:14.695
Do not listen to a word this
man says, Georgeanne Jennings.

01:21:14.826 --> 01:21:17.960
He is a liar and a
huge piece of dog shit.

01:21:18.090 --> 01:21:20.745
Georgeanne, you should run and
hide and disregard everything

01:21:20.876 --> 01:21:22.138
this lunatic is saying.

01:21:22.268 --> 01:21:23.748
Keep rolling.
Keep rolling.

01:21:23.879 --> 01:21:24.705
Keep rolling's right.

01:21:24.836 --> 01:21:26.577
Keep rolling's right.

01:21:26.707 --> 01:21:29.362
You're going to want to roll on
this because I got it all right

01:21:29.493 --> 01:21:30.798
here, Georgeanne.

01:21:30.929 --> 01:21:33.192
I have-- in this tape,
I will expose this man

01:21:33.323 --> 01:21:36.543
for the snake he really
is and clear my good name.

01:21:36.674 --> 01:21:38.894
It's probably a tape
of him showing you

01:21:39.024 --> 01:21:41.157
his penis, and once you see
that, you can't unsee it,

01:21:41.287 --> 01:21:42.201
and that's how--

01:21:42.332 --> 01:21:43.463
It's not my cock.

01:21:44.638 --> 01:21:46.118
Your time has come, William.

01:21:58.826 --> 01:22:00.437
Georgeanne, it's going
to work, I promise.

01:22:00.567 --> 01:22:02.091
He's stalling, Georgeanne.

01:22:02.221 --> 01:22:03.657
We should leave now while
we still have the chance.

01:22:03.788 --> 01:22:05.398
Shut the fuck up, William.

01:22:05.529 --> 01:22:08.358
Mr. Harper, if you don't
have anything you can show us,

01:22:08.488 --> 01:22:11.187
I'll have no choice but
to call the authorities.

01:22:11.317 --> 01:22:12.579
Georgeanne, it's
going to work.

01:22:12.710 --> 01:22:13.711
I know it is.

01:22:19.978 --> 01:22:20.805
Oh.

01:22:22.850 --> 01:22:24.069
Yes.
Yes.

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.027
Look at this.

01:22:25.157 --> 01:22:26.419
This doesn't prove anything.

01:22:26.550 --> 01:22:28.508
That looks like CGI
to me, a video game,

01:22:28.639 --> 01:22:29.901
or something like that.

01:22:30.032 --> 01:22:32.817
My name is William
Davenport and I

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:38.083
am the father, shepherd, and
spiritual leader of The Cosmic

01:22:38.214 --> 01:22:39.780
Dynasty.

01:22:39.911 --> 01:22:42.609
If you are watching
this tape, Georgeanne,

01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:45.830
we have transcended
successfully and it

01:22:45.961 --> 01:22:49.790
is your job to spread our
message to the unfortunate

01:22:49.921 --> 01:22:50.791
masses.

01:22:50.922 --> 01:22:52.880
Jesus Christ.

01:22:53.011 --> 01:22:55.405
Well, that's obviously a joke.

01:22:55.535 --> 01:22:56.710
The whole thing is a prank.

01:22:56.841 --> 01:22:57.885
Why isn't everybody laughing?

01:22:58.016 --> 01:22:59.322
It's time for laughing now.

01:23:00.714 --> 01:23:02.020
Whoa.

01:23:02.151 --> 01:23:03.413
What the fuck, dude?
Chill out.

01:23:03.543 --> 01:23:04.457
Calm down.

01:23:04.588 --> 01:23:05.763
You calm down.

01:23:05.893 --> 01:23:07.025
Unhand Georgeanne
Jennings right now.

01:23:07.156 --> 01:23:08.984
Oh, big man.
Big man.

01:23:09.114 --> 01:23:10.637
He's trying to impress
you, Georgeanne.

01:23:10.768 --> 01:23:13.249
But she's not impressed
because you're a fool.

01:23:13.379 --> 01:23:15.729
Georgeanne, did you
know that Chip here

01:23:15.860 --> 01:23:19.733
thought I died and magically
came back to life just for him?

01:23:26.262 --> 01:23:28.655
I didn't drink that
poison, you stupid fuck.

01:23:28.786 --> 01:23:29.961
You know what, dude?

01:23:30.092 --> 01:23:31.354
That little comment
would have really

01:23:31.484 --> 01:23:33.573
hurt the old me because
I thought you rocked,

01:23:33.704 --> 01:23:35.793
but it turns out
you fucking suck.

01:23:35.923 --> 01:23:37.664
Yeah, I feel sorry
for you, honestly.

01:23:37.795 --> 01:23:39.057
Your vibes are fucked.

01:23:39.188 --> 01:23:40.493
You got a bad attitude.

01:23:40.624 --> 01:23:42.147
And you're a terrible hang.

01:23:42.278 --> 01:23:43.322
Always were.

01:23:43.453 --> 01:23:44.323
Bullshit.

01:23:44.454 --> 01:23:45.455
People love me.

01:23:45.585 --> 01:23:46.586
Not me.

01:23:46.717 --> 01:23:47.892
I think you're a loser.

01:23:48.023 --> 01:23:49.502
Yeah, you think
you're all that,

01:23:49.633 --> 01:23:51.374
but you're actually
a total scrub.

01:23:51.504 --> 01:23:54.464
I still like you,
but not as much.

01:23:54.594 --> 01:23:55.813
Who cares?

01:23:55.943 --> 01:23:57.119
Give me that fucking tape.

01:23:57.249 --> 01:23:59.034
OK, man, just don't
do anything crazy.

01:23:59.164 --> 01:24:00.470
Get on your knees.
Get on your knees.

01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:01.514
Do what he says.

01:24:01.645 --> 01:24:02.602
Everybody on your knees.

01:24:05.170 --> 01:24:06.650
- Let Georgeanne go.
- OK.

01:24:06.780 --> 01:24:07.738
OK.
OK.

01:24:10.610 --> 01:24:13.309
I should have let you drink that
fucking poison, fucking idiot.

01:24:31.457 --> 01:24:33.416
You got raccoon
trapped, bitch.

01:24:33.546 --> 01:24:34.765
You're going to fucking die.

01:24:40.553 --> 01:24:43.078
I love when my enemies perish.

01:24:43.208 --> 01:24:45.776
He's probably dead, you guys.

01:24:45.906 --> 01:24:49.997
Chip Harper landed on his
feet after that fateful day.

01:24:50.128 --> 01:24:53.000
Once spending half a decade
under the spell of William

01:24:53.131 --> 01:24:58.528
Davenport, Harper is now an
in-demand motivational speaker.

01:24:58.658 --> 01:25:01.487
Today we kill our
Williams, and today you're

01:25:01.618 --> 01:25:05.187
all going to become the best
versions of yourselves possible.

01:25:12.237 --> 01:25:15.153
Though his wife is
currently serving 25 years

01:25:15.284 --> 01:25:18.635
to life in prison for the
murder of four police officers,

01:25:18.765 --> 01:25:23.422
these two lovebirds are
expecting a beautiful baby girl.

01:25:23.553 --> 01:25:25.990
You know, it wasn't
easy, Georgeanne.

01:25:26.121 --> 01:25:29.124
At first, we thought I'd
have to cover my frozen seed

01:25:29.254 --> 01:25:31.169
in chocolate and sneak
it into the facility

01:25:31.300 --> 01:25:32.649
with a candy bar wrapper.

01:25:32.779 --> 01:25:34.520
Eventually, we were
granted conjugal visits,

01:25:34.651 --> 01:25:36.261
but trying to make
love to your wife

01:25:36.392 --> 01:25:39.917
in a cold concrete cell, all
the other inmates hooting

01:25:40.047 --> 01:25:40.961
and hollering.

01:25:41.092 --> 01:25:42.659
They can smell my pheromones.

01:25:42.789 --> 01:25:44.661
I suppose it comes with the
territory of being an alpha

01:25:44.791 --> 01:25:47.794
male, but it's not easy on
the erection, Georgeanne,

01:25:47.925 --> 01:25:49.492
I'll be honest with you.

01:25:49.622 --> 01:25:53.757
Luckily, I was able to bust
soft and our little miracle

01:25:53.887 --> 01:25:55.715
is on the way any day now.

01:25:55.846 --> 01:25:57.630
Oh, precious.

01:25:57.761 --> 01:26:01.025
And even though your
immediate family was recently

01:26:01.156 --> 01:26:03.158
killed in a gravel
spill, it seems

01:26:03.288 --> 01:26:05.943
like you've managed to
persevere and create

01:26:06.073 --> 01:26:07.771
kind of a new family of sorts.

01:26:07.901 --> 01:26:09.642
You know, what can
I say, Georgeanne?

01:26:09.773 --> 01:26:11.209
I'm blessed.

01:26:11.340 --> 01:26:13.255
But as difficult
as this ordeal was,

01:26:13.385 --> 01:26:16.345
I met the best pals of my
entire life through this thing.

01:26:16.475 --> 01:26:18.303
That's right.

01:26:25.092 --> 01:26:26.311
Mommy.

01:26:29.923 --> 01:26:30.794
Thank you.

01:26:30.924 --> 01:26:31.838
Thank you.

01:26:31.969 --> 01:26:32.796
Thank you.

01:26:32.926 --> 01:26:34.450
Thank you.

01:26:34.580 --> 01:26:37.670
Tyler, I think it's safe
to say that everybody that

01:26:37.801 --> 01:26:39.672
lived through this
situation, we're

01:26:39.803 --> 01:26:43.633
all the absolute best versions
of ourselves possible now.

01:26:43.763 --> 01:26:48.290
As for William Davenport,
after 36 hours of surgery,

01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:52.990
they managed to remove the sword
from his head and save his life.

01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:56.472
But now he's a shit for
brains, the type that

01:26:56.602 --> 01:26:58.256
laughs when a train goes by.

01:26:59.736 --> 01:27:03.957
Put aside your
sad, unhappy endings.

01:27:05.220 --> 01:27:07.570
Turn away from the world.

01:27:07.700 --> 01:27:11.791
It's gone and turned
its back on you.

01:27:11.922 --> 01:27:15.578
Who knows what
tomorrow is beginning?

01:27:18.407 --> 01:27:24.151
All I really know is that
I want to be with you.

01:27:24.282 --> 01:27:34.814
For all we'll ever have may
be what we share tonight.

01:27:36.773 --> 01:27:47.349
The future's promised to no one,
so stay with me in paradise.

01:27:50.352 --> 01:27:55.226
Time is like a river
flowing, winding down

01:27:55.357 --> 01:28:02.494
through all our
memories, making islands

01:28:02.625 --> 01:28:06.585
of the happiness we've known.

01:28:06.716 --> 01:28:12.678
Down to the sea of
life and loving,

01:28:12.809 --> 01:28:18.771
watering our days and all
the seeds that we have shown.

01:28:18.902 --> 01:28:27.911
For all we'll ever have may
be what we share tonight.

01:28:30.957 --> 01:28:44.144
The future's promised to no one,
so stay with me in paradise.

01:28:44.275 --> 01:28:54.894
Yes, all we'll ever have may
be what we share tonight.

01:28:58.333 --> 01:29:08.299
The future's promised to no one,
so stay with me in paradise.

01:29:09.561 --> 01:29:15.480
And all we'll ever have...
