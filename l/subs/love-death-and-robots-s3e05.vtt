[laughs]

00:42.875 --> 00:44.333
This is some bullshit, Sergeant.

00:44.416 --> 00:46.708
Shut the fuck up, Macy.

00:47.375 --> 00:50.583
Folen! You're gonna get shot in the dick
if you stand in silhouette like that.

00:50.666 --> 00:54.375
[spits] Yep. Right in the dick.

00:54.458 --> 00:57.083
I'm just trying
to see how far out I can get it.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.916
I've got the aim of an angel

01:00.000 --> 01:02.625
and the reach of a god. [sighs]

01:02.708 --> 01:04.875
How much further to the objective, Sarge?

01:04.958 --> 01:07.458
Another 500 meters… up.

01:07.541 --> 01:08.875
[eagle screeching]

We're within 500 meters of the objective.

[radio static]

01:21.166 --> 01:22.750
Everything all right, Sergeant?

01:22.833 --> 01:24.833
Fine. Fucking peachy.

01:24.916 --> 01:26.000
[tense music playing]

01:26.083 --> 01:28.500
[Macy] Fine,
like in no radio contact with anyone

01:28.583 --> 01:30.625
for the last 50 fucking minutes?

01:30.708 --> 01:33.333
[Folen] Fine,
like our idiotic fucking platoon leader

01:33.416 --> 01:35.000
decided to split us up?

01:35.083 --> 01:38.291
[soldier] Fine, like I have to keep
hauling this fucking ammo

01:38.375 --> 01:40.000
up this motherfucking mountain?

01:40.083 --> 01:44.541
Fine, like Team Two's been torn
into greasy shreds of man jerky?

[Folen] Jesus fuck.

01:50.166 --> 01:51.625
Look at this thing here.

01:51.708 --> 01:54.541
Almost as big as my dick. [chuckles]

01:55.208 --> 01:57.333
Well, I guess he won't be needing this.

01:57.416 --> 02:00.583
It's… It's the whole team.
Muj didn't do this, Sergeant.

02:00.666 --> 02:03.041
Hey, hey, hey.
It doesn't matter what did it.

02:03.125 --> 02:05.041
We're gonna get through this, soldier.

02:05.541 --> 02:06.583
Together.

02:08.583 --> 02:09.416
"Together"?

02:09.916 --> 02:12.666
I bet that'll look great

[guns cocking]

02:21.833 --> 02:23.250
What? Uh, what?

02:23.333 --> 02:24.416
It's a honey badger.

02:24.500 --> 02:26.125
Honey badgers don't give a shit!

02:26.208 --> 02:29.125
That's it. We've all gone crazy.
Time to kill each other.

02:29.208 --> 02:32.875
Oh, thank God. I'm so tired
of carrying all this fucking ammo around.

02:32.958 --> 02:35.291
You assholes don't have
my permission to die.

Fuck you, honey badger!

-Fuck. Oh, I'm standing on your friend.

03:52.333 --> 03:53.166
Sorry.

This really sucks.

03:55.041 --> 03:56.166
-No shit.
-[metal clanking]

03:56.250 --> 03:57.583
Who the hell's this guy?

03:58.416 --> 04:01.541
Sergeant First Class Morris,
attached to Task Force Griffin.

04:01.625 --> 04:03.166
Stationed at Camp Eisenhower.

04:03.250 --> 04:05.875
-It's right over that ridge.
-No such place as Camp Eisenhower.

04:05.958 --> 04:08.166
Sure there is.
You just didn't know about it.

04:08.250 --> 04:09.583
It's subterranean.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.375
Bullshit that's where you're from.

04:11.458 --> 04:13.250
You're stationed at Camp Bullshit,

04:13.333 --> 04:16.250
and you drink
from a CamelBak full of lies.

04:18.250 --> 04:21.458
CIA built it back in '02,
right after the invasion.

04:21.541 --> 04:23.791
It's just another part
of our hearts and minds strategy.

04:23.875 --> 04:26.791
And let me guess.
It's part of some Secret Squirrel op,

04:26.875 --> 04:29.833
and you've got all kinds
of crazy sciencey shit under there,

04:29.916 --> 04:33.000
including fucking nightmares
like that thing.

04:33.083 --> 04:36.875
Well, that thing
is code named Project Barghest.

04:36.958 --> 04:41.416
It was on patrol with us last night
when it started acting unpatriotic,

04:41.500 --> 04:44.791
and treated my team
like an Afghani buffet.

04:44.875 --> 04:48.666
Bar-guest? That's a stupid fucking name
for a honey badger.

04:48.750 --> 04:50.708
It's not a honey badger.

04:50.791 --> 04:53.625
It's a genetically-engineered grizzly bear

04:53.708 --> 04:56.208
with a shit-ton
of mechanical augmentation.

04:56.291 --> 04:58.416
-It's like a tank with fur.
-[electronic warbling]

05:03.333 --> 05:08.000
all wrapped in a solid inch
of ballistic-resistant gel under its skin.

05:08.083 --> 05:11.791
Small arms won't do jack-shit,
and even grenades won't hurt it.

05:11.875 --> 05:13.875
Unless you get lucky, which you won't.

05:13.958 --> 05:16.166
-Can you kill it with that?
-[Morris] This piece of shit?

05:16.250 --> 05:17.916
No. It's supposed to be a remote control,

05:18.000 --> 05:21.625
but the only thing that works is
this setting that says "fuck off."

05:22.125 --> 05:25.083
Come on, guys. Let's go
to that base you don't think exists.

05:26.041 --> 05:26.875
Well, Sarge?

05:27.416 --> 05:30.416
Why not?
I doubt this shit could get any weirder.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.250
[Morris] Dang it. It was right here.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.291
It was right there. It was there.

05:35.375 --> 05:37.291
There was a fucking rock. Fucking there.

05:37.375 --> 05:41.708
It appears the secret back entrance
to your secret CIA base

05:41.791 --> 05:44.708
is so extra fucking secret
even you can't find it.

05:45.250 --> 05:47.208
Sarge, we got permission to die now?

05:47.291 --> 05:49.125
Getting there, Folen. Getting there.

05:49.208 --> 05:51.041
Oh, here it is. [chuckles]

05:51.125 --> 05:52.625

05:52.708 --> 05:54.708
-Yet…

06:07.583 --> 06:09.708
Guessing it wasn't like this
when you left.

06:09.791 --> 06:11.458
No. It fucking wasn't.

06:11.541 --> 06:14.541
Well, personally,
I love what they've done with the place.

06:14.625 --> 06:15.958
[Barghest roars]

06:16.958 --> 06:17.916
[Morris] All right.

06:18.416 --> 06:21.125
Let's get some proper fucking ordnance

06:21.208 --> 06:23.916
and kill the shit
out of this fucking thing!

06:24.416 --> 06:25.500

[Morris] You drool on it, you buy it.

06:42.833 --> 06:45.875

Friendly.

06:52.416 --> 06:54.666

-Hi. Hi.

06:59.333 --> 07:01.833
Oh, who's your buddy, MAARS-Bot?
Who's your buddy?

07:01.916 --> 07:04.708
Oh, sweet. More science shit.

07:04.791 --> 07:06.916
He gonna go rogue and try and eat us too?

07:08.041 --> 07:11.458
You didn't think the CIA would make
just one Jihad-Joe killing weapon,

07:11.541 --> 07:12.375
did you?

07:12.458 --> 07:14.166
Redundancy, son, saves lives.

You better put me in for a Bronze Star
after this shit, Morris.

07:33.541 --> 07:35.416
You've got a bad attitude, Private Macy,

07:35.500 --> 07:37.916
and I will deny any award
he puts you in for.

All right, ladies.
I'm gonna call the Barghest to us.
