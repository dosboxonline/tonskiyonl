16:06.133 --> 16:08.635
Wait and see.
Cops never let up, you know?

16:08.844 --> 16:12.556
I'll have rubbers on my desk,
in the mail, in the coffee...

16:12.764 --> 16:17.352
If you'd only shut your mouth. You
told everybody. I'm going for a walk.

16:17.561 --> 16:20.689
Give the boys some credit.
In one ear, out the rubber.

16:28.864 --> 16:30.490
[KNOCKING]

16:33.910 --> 16:35.954
How goes it with you, Hans?

16:36.163 --> 16:38.623
Okay. You, Pieter?

16:39.291 --> 16:42.419
That's quite enough of that.
Come on over here, Hans.

16:44.296 --> 16:47.924
Mind the plastic.
I'm having some painting done.

16:48.717 --> 16:51.469
The important thing is,
are you all right?

16:51.928 --> 16:53.763
No bones broken?

16:54.431 --> 16:55.765
I'm fine, thank you.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.642
Just bumps and bruises, eh?

16:58.435 --> 16:59.811
Yeah, that's all.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.605
Good, good.

17:05.108 --> 17:07.944
However, we did lose over $1 million
in Krugerrand.

17:09.445 --> 17:12.449
I know. I'm sorry, Mr. Rudd.

17:13.116 --> 17:14.451
It happens.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.619
It's not your fault.

17:16.953 --> 17:19.955
Sometimes these things
do not go as planned.

17:20.665 --> 17:24.169
As you say, they just happen,
eh, Pieter?

17:32.344 --> 17:35.513
You give a whole new meaning
to the word "drop cloth."

17:36.473 --> 17:40.477
Certain policemen in this city
have become an intolerable nuisance.

17:41.144 --> 17:45.649
They are obviously onto us again.
How do you propose to handle it?

17:45.815 --> 17:47.317
Warn them off.

17:49.027 --> 17:50.654
It's my experience...

17:51.488 --> 17:54.574
...that a scared cop is
more useful than a dead one.

17:54.824 --> 17:56.201
A warning?

17:56.493 --> 17:58.328
Is that not a bit tame?

17:58.828 --> 18:00.163
Depends how you do it.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.000
Then you'd better look at this.

18:10.382 --> 18:13.885
This is the policeman in charge.

18:16.513 --> 18:17.806
PIETER:
Goddamn <i>kaffir.</i>

18:19.432 --> 18:20.600
Lovely.

18:21.685 --> 18:23.311
TRISH:
Remember to take these in order.

18:24.354 --> 18:27.190
There's a packet
for each day of the week.

18:27.691 --> 18:28.733
Thank you.

18:28.900 --> 18:30.193
This yours?

18:31.194 --> 18:32.696
I found it in the wash.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.073
Yeah.

18:37.367 --> 18:38.368
Thanks.

18:39.411 --> 18:40.954
I keep on losing this.

18:42.080 --> 18:43.206
Something's wrong.

18:43.415 --> 18:47.043
No, not really.
It's just a goddamn pen.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.339
What about the pen?

18:51.756 --> 18:53.717
It just reminds me of something.

18:54.718 --> 18:55.885
Reminds you of what?

18:56.720 --> 18:58.221
It reminds me of...

18:58.555 --> 19:00.390
...the night Vicki was killed.

19:01.599 --> 19:02.892
I didn't mean to push.

19:04.436 --> 19:07.147
That's okay.
We never really talked about this.

19:12.152 --> 19:16.573
I was supposed to meet her for dinner,
one of those romantic dinners for two.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.158
I had so much work.

19:20.577 --> 19:22.454
I forgot about the whole thing.

19:24.164 --> 19:28.460
She waited at the restaurant for
an hour before she drove home alone.

19:30.086 --> 19:34.257
It was midnight when I got home
to a ringing phone, so I answered it.

19:34.466 --> 19:36.926
They told me she was killed
in a car crash.

19:42.432 --> 19:45.769
I should've been driving.
We'd have been all right.

19:48.146 --> 19:52.108
I remember falling down on my knees,
and I started shaking all over.

19:52.317 --> 19:55.195
I remember thinking,
"I'm just losing it."

19:56.279 --> 19:58.907
So there I was,
lying on the living room floor.

20:00.116 --> 20:03.953
Lying there, and I'm seeing under
the couch, and I see this gold pen...

20:05.121 --> 20:06.414
...just lying there.

20:06.623 --> 20:10.335
I'd been looking for it everywhere
for two months. There it is.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.214
She wasn't much of a housekeeper.

20:15.924 --> 20:19.469
This voice goes off inside my head,
like a drill instructor.

20:20.470 --> 20:22.847
It said, "Get up! Now!"

20:24.224 --> 20:26.559
I didn't feel like it,
but I got up.

20:26.810 --> 20:28.686
Muscles were still working.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.481
Then I drove to the hospital...

20:31.981 --> 20:34.984
...identified her
and signed her out with my gold pen.

20:35.193 --> 20:38.488
Gold pen? Trish found
a gold pen in the laundry.

20:47.872 --> 20:50.375
Look around you, Sam.
Look around you.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.503
One day, Sam...

20:54.170 --> 20:56.005
...this'll all be yours.

20:59.467 --> 21:02.554
Find a nice bitch,
raise a couple of pups.

21:03.346 --> 21:05.598
A man could live here and be happy.

21:09.853 --> 21:13.690
Anybody tell you if you sit on
cold rocks too long, you'll get piles?

21:13.898 --> 21:15.692
Let's go watch some TV.

22:44.948 --> 22:46.282
<i>Kaffirs!</i>

22:49.577 --> 22:51.120
Wondering about your kids?

22:52.288 --> 22:54.457
You wondering what we done to them?

22:55.458 --> 22:57.961
If I was you, I'd be going nuts now.

22:59.128 --> 23:01.339
I'd be going fucking bananas.

23:02.298 --> 23:04.008
Want to know what we done?

23:04.384 --> 23:05.426
Shall I tell you?

23:07.470 --> 23:10.139
You just let your imagination
run riot.

23:10.848 --> 23:12.809
This has just been a warning.

23:13.142 --> 23:16.896
After this, it gets bloody.
You tell your people to back off.

23:17.146 --> 23:18.815
Don't be a smart <i>kaffir.</i>

23:19.482 --> 23:22.318
Maybe we let you live, huh?
Come on, let's go.

23:33.830 --> 23:35.915
Are you all right?

23:42.171 --> 23:45.174
RIGGS: You didn't see a face?
MURTAUGH: No. They all had on hoods.

23:45.341 --> 23:46.634
What about a voice?

23:46.843 --> 23:51.389
That motherfucker who did talk had a
strange accent. I couldn't place it.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.266
Not German, not English.

23:53.516 --> 23:56.352
Kind of guttural.
You know, a shitty accent.

23:56.519 --> 24:00.023
Anything like what we were chasing
the other night?

24:00.273 --> 24:02.692
Yeah, kind of like that.

24:03.151 --> 24:04.527
Trish and the kids?

24:04.736 --> 24:07.655
They're at her sister's house
in Bellflower.

24:07.864 --> 24:12.201
Listen up. You all heard about
what happened to Rog last night?

24:12.452 --> 24:14.454
Forensics get back with anything?

24:14.704 --> 24:16.789
Nothing yet. They'll keep us posted.

24:17.165 --> 24:20.460
The point being, we gotta watch
each other's backs and fronts.

24:20.710 --> 24:24.547
You're all invited to watch my back
in poker tomorrow. You in?

24:24.756 --> 24:27.759
- If we catch these assholes.
- Count me in.

24:33.389 --> 24:36.059
I got something special for you boys.

24:36.225 --> 24:39.228
Leo Getz has been placed
in protective custody.

24:39.395 --> 24:43.191
You guys are gonna babysit him
until Washington sends the feds.

24:43.483 --> 24:46.611
- How long?
- Soon as the red tape is processed.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.071
Three days.

24:48.404 --> 24:52.492
This guy Getz is gonna testify
before a commission of inquiry.

24:52.742 --> 24:54.911
Drugs, laundered money, et cetera.

24:55.411 --> 24:57.288
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

24:58.915 --> 25:00.583
This is not a shit assignment.

25:00.917 --> 25:02.919
- Yes, it is.
ED: No, it isn't.

25:03.127 --> 25:05.088
- It isn't.
- It's a shit assignment.

25:05.254 --> 25:06.756
Shut up, the both of you.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.091
Here you go, sir.

25:08.299 --> 25:10.760
- I guaranteed this guy's safety.
- Why us?

25:10.927 --> 25:14.263
Because you two are
the most qualified for the job.

25:14.514 --> 25:17.433
And after last night,
you could use the break.

25:17.600 --> 25:18.935
I can handle last night.

25:20.144 --> 25:21.437
What do we do with him?

25:21.646 --> 25:23.940
How should I know?
Take him to Disneyland.

25:24.148 --> 25:25.942
This stinks. This stinks.

25:26.150 --> 25:27.360
I don't give a fuck.

25:27.610 --> 25:30.738
I don't have an ulcer,
because I know when to say that.

25:30.947 --> 25:33.449
Here's where he's staying.
It's a nice hotel.

25:33.616 --> 25:36.953
Expenses are paid by the Justice
Department, so enjoy yourselves.

25:37.286 --> 25:39.622
And Riggs, one more thing.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.543
Know what that says?

25:43.960 --> 25:46.629
Same thing as that.
But I don't give a fuck.

25:50.633 --> 25:53.469
You're lucky.
I have to live with that.

26:02.812 --> 26:04.021
Excuse me.

26:04.480 --> 26:06.149
What room is that for?

26:06.315 --> 26:07.358
612.

26:10.194 --> 26:11.988
This is it. 612.

26:14.657 --> 26:15.992
MAN: Who is it?
- Police.

26:16.701 --> 26:17.994
How do I know that?

26:18.327 --> 26:21.831
After I shoot you through the door,
you can examine the bullet.

26:23.666 --> 26:25.835
Don't you want to see a badge?

26:26.043 --> 26:27.503
- Where's your badge?
- Shut up.

26:27.670 --> 26:30.047
I get it.
Bad cop, good cop.

26:30.465 --> 26:31.841
Shut up!

26:33.050 --> 26:35.344
Bad cop, bad cop.
I know the routines.

26:35.511 --> 26:38.514
- Are you Leo Getz?
- That's me, Leo Getz.

26:38.723 --> 26:42.268
Whatever you need, Leo gets.
You get it?

26:42.727 --> 26:45.521
I use that to break the ice
when I meet people.

26:45.855 --> 26:47.857
I'm Sgt. Murtaugh.
This is Sgt. Riggs.

26:48.024 --> 26:51.277
How you doing? Nice to meet you.
What do I call you guys?

26:51.527 --> 26:54.781
- Sgt. Murtaugh and Sgt. Riggs.
- We're gonna be your shadow.

26:57.033 --> 26:59.035
That's all right.
An old-fashioned...!

27:00.411 --> 27:03.498
Okay. I just ain't seen one
in a long time.

27:03.706 --> 27:06.542
I didn't think anybody
used those things anymore.

27:06.709 --> 27:09.796
I'll bet you the kid's got
an automatic. Got an automatic?

27:10.046 --> 27:11.214
Yep, a Beretta.

27:11.380 --> 27:12.632
Don't touch it.

27:13.549 --> 27:15.051
You sure you guys are cops?

27:16.052 --> 27:19.722
Better watch how you treat me.
I'm the state's star witness.

27:21.265 --> 27:23.017
We'll take that room.

27:23.768 --> 27:27.730
Actually, I already have my stuff
in this room. You know, when I...

27:32.902 --> 27:35.780
Okay, okay. It's yours.
My stuff's gone.

27:36.030 --> 27:38.241
I'll move it in the small room, okay?

27:38.658 --> 27:42.119
I'm the smallest guy here.
I'll take the small room.

27:42.328 --> 27:45.790
Come on, loosen up a little, guys.
We'll be together a long time.

27:46.082 --> 27:47.250
[KNOCKING]

27:47.416 --> 27:48.417
I'll get it.

27:49.544 --> 27:51.796
It's only room service.

27:52.088 --> 27:54.674
You hungry? I'll call
and get anything you want.

27:54.924 --> 27:57.426
See this silk robe?
Silk pajamas? Free!

27:57.593 --> 27:59.262
- It's not free.
- Yes, it is!

27:59.428 --> 28:02.557
- It's taxpayers' money.
- Oh, God! It's the same thing.

28:06.143 --> 28:07.687
Good morning, gentlemen.

28:11.607 --> 28:15.319
That's my food! You guys didn't
want anything. Bring it here.

28:16.112 --> 28:17.780
It's mine. Boy!

28:18.114 --> 28:20.449
You could've had anything you wanted.

28:21.117 --> 28:22.827
I ordered eggs, not hamburger.

28:28.958 --> 28:30.501
Martin, not the window!

28:33.337 --> 28:34.463
Shit!

29:00.156 --> 29:01.616
Where is that son of a bitch?

29:03.492 --> 29:06.162
RIGGS: Somebody stop that guy!
Stop him!

29:07.997 --> 29:11.334
Don't leave me! I can't swim!

29:12.001 --> 29:13.753
RIGGS:
Get off me!

29:14.003 --> 29:15.004
Get off me!

29:17.006 --> 29:21.636
We're near the edge of the pool.
Now get the fuck off my back.

29:22.011 --> 29:24.347
Clear, move it! Get back! Police!

29:25.389 --> 29:26.432
You all right?

29:26.641 --> 29:29.393
I'm okay.
Why didn't you follow me down?

29:29.644 --> 29:32.021
- Why didn't you?
- I was seven floors up!

29:33.356 --> 29:34.440
He hit me.

29:34.690 --> 29:35.691
Good!

29:36.067 --> 29:37.652
Leo.

29:37.860 --> 29:40.738
This guy took an awful chance
to pop all of us.

29:40.947 --> 29:42.740
Did you witness a murder?

29:42.949 --> 29:45.076
No, nothing like that. Honest.

29:47.536 --> 29:52.166
All I did was, I laundered
half a billion dollars in drug money.

29:53.209 --> 29:55.211
Half a billion dollars?

29:55.419 --> 29:59.048
Give or take a few.
Who could count with that much money?

29:59.298 --> 30:02.718
Could I please have some cotton balls
for my nose?

30:03.219 --> 30:04.887
Could you please shut up?

30:05.554 --> 30:08.391
- You're supposed to take care of me.
- Shut up!

30:09.183 --> 30:13.312
Mr. Getz got away. Our best
opportunity, and he gets away.

30:13.562 --> 30:18.275
He slips right through our fingers
and into the hands of the police.

30:18.901 --> 30:20.236
What are you doing?

30:21.070 --> 30:24.573
Just checking to see
if I was standing on plastic.

30:25.282 --> 30:27.201
LEO:
Okay, I got it. Okay, here.

30:27.618 --> 30:31.205
I'm who I am. You're a drug dealer.
I work in a bank.

30:31.414 --> 30:34.000
You have money to launder.
What do you do?

30:34.333 --> 30:35.501
I bring it to you.

30:36.919 --> 30:39.922
- He does.
- Me? I don't understand. Why me?

30:40.297 --> 30:41.465
Who am I?

30:41.757 --> 30:43.259
I'll tell you.

30:43.426 --> 30:45.803
You're a courier. You work for him.

30:46.095 --> 30:47.930
I'm the drug dealer.

30:51.142 --> 30:54.937
Don't you have plates?
Here. Come on. What is this?

30:56.772 --> 31:01.318
I deposit the cash into the account
of a dummy finance company.

31:02.611 --> 31:05.781
Then I issue you a cashier's check
in his name...

31:06.157 --> 31:08.743
...minus a small commission
for myself.

31:09.785 --> 31:11.495
- You like breathing?
- How much?

31:11.746 --> 31:12.872
Two percent.

31:13.456 --> 31:16.625
Not bad, Leo. Pretty prosperous.

31:18.627 --> 31:21.839
You give it back to me as collateral
on a loan I make to you.

31:22.048 --> 31:25.634
But you don't pay back the loan.
You keep the money.

31:25.843 --> 31:26.886
How's that work?

31:27.053 --> 31:29.680
How's what? That's it!
Don't you get it?

31:29.889 --> 31:33.809
It's your money. You don't pay
it back. It's yours, and it's clean!

31:34.018 --> 31:36.270
It is now laundered.

31:37.688 --> 31:39.982
You cops aren't too bright, are you?

31:40.149 --> 31:41.567
Okay, okay, okay.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.986
This is the best part. You got it?

31:44.570 --> 31:47.364
You take a tax deduction...

31:47.990 --> 31:51.368
...on interest payments
that you don't even make.

31:52.828 --> 31:55.331
- Am I a genius?
- You're a swindler.

31:55.498 --> 31:56.499
Cheat!

31:56.707 --> 31:58.042
Come on.

31:58.501 --> 32:01.045
Everybody cheats.
Look at the Pentagon.

32:01.337 --> 32:02.588
So you got it?

32:04.590 --> 32:07.676
Okay, Mr. Big Shot,
how come you turned yourself in?

32:08.177 --> 32:10.387
I was scamming those guys for months.

32:10.846 --> 32:12.765
Every transaction, I kept a little.

32:12.932 --> 32:13.974
You?

32:14.391 --> 32:16.560
It was easy.
All those cash deposits.

32:16.894 --> 32:20.189
Millions of dollars in small bills
changing hands.

32:20.356 --> 32:23.526
Who's gonna miss $10,000 here,
$20,000 there?

32:24.443 --> 32:25.861
Drug dealers.

32:26.445 --> 32:28.072
That's right. They did.

32:28.447 --> 32:31.117
That's why I'm living
out of a suitcase now.

32:33.702 --> 32:35.371
You can give that to Nick.

32:35.913 --> 32:39.041
I'll bet you it's softer.
I put fabric softener in.

32:39.208 --> 32:40.251
It's small, Leroy.

32:40.459 --> 32:44.630
It's not Leroy, it's Leo. And if
you want, I'll buy you another shirt!

32:44.880 --> 32:47.842
Do me a favor. Give me the names
of those drug dealers.

32:48.050 --> 32:51.846
I don't know any drug dealers.
All I dealt with was couriers.

32:52.054 --> 32:56.058
- Where does Trish keep my laundry?
MURTAUGH: On the shelf in back.

32:57.434 --> 32:59.895
You never met anyone except couriers?

33:01.480 --> 33:02.898
No names.

33:06.152 --> 33:09.238
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Come to think of it...

33:09.572 --> 33:10.614
Okay, listen.

33:10.948 --> 33:14.869
They took me up to the hills
in this house with stilts on it.

33:15.077 --> 33:17.955
And I had a job interview
with a guy...

33:18.247 --> 33:20.249
...and his name was...

33:21.167 --> 33:22.751
...Haynes. Hans!

33:22.918 --> 33:25.254
- Take us there.
- We have to sit on this guy.

33:25.462 --> 33:27.298
It won't do any harm to look.

33:27.673 --> 33:29.800
- I know the address.
- Let's go.

33:29.967 --> 33:31.010
We shouldn't!

33:31.177 --> 33:33.262
Come on, don't be a killjoy!

33:33.429 --> 33:36.015
We're back, we're bad!
You're black, I'm mad.

33:36.265 --> 33:38.017
This is going to be great!

33:38.392 --> 33:41.103
If we're going,
shouldn't I have a gun?

33:41.270 --> 33:42.313
No!

33:43.689 --> 33:46.192
Is my nose still bleeding?
It's really sore.

33:46.442 --> 33:48.110
I'm sorry about that.

33:52.948 --> 33:54.742
LEO:
It should be coming up soon.

33:54.950 --> 33:57.286
- 9856.
RIGGS: That's it.

33:57.453 --> 34:00.789
- That's another possibility.
- This is the ninth possibility.

34:00.998 --> 34:04.126
That's it! Nine. My lucky number.

34:04.460 --> 34:06.670
Stay in the car, you hear?

34:08.005 --> 34:09.882
LEO: Can't I come?
RIGGS: Stay.

34:12.134 --> 34:13.469
Nice car.

34:13.969 --> 34:15.888
WOMAN: What are you doing?
MAN: Hooking it up.

34:16.096 --> 34:18.139
WOMAN: You're not looking
at what you're doing!

34:18.389 --> 34:22.436
MAN: I know what I'm doing. I'm
towing your car, not a baby carriage.

34:22.645 --> 34:24.897
WOMAN: You're chipping the paint.
I can hear it!

34:25.898 --> 34:28.775
- You smell what I smell?
- I smell something.

34:28.984 --> 34:30.485
What's that? A rat?

34:30.985 --> 34:32.905
A stinky one too.

34:36.408 --> 34:37.659
Where you going?

34:37.826 --> 34:40.496
I'm a peeping Tom.
It goes with the badge.

34:40.788 --> 34:42.206
It's fun sometimes too.

34:44.123 --> 34:45.167
Bingo!

34:49.420 --> 34:50.839
Lars, look!

34:51.047 --> 34:52.925
LARS:
What the fuck?

34:56.679 --> 34:57.680
Hey! Hey!

34:57.846 --> 34:59.848
- Where's the pool?
- There's no pool.

35:00.182 --> 35:01.225
There's no pool.

35:01.433 --> 35:03.352
This house is built on stilts.

35:03.519 --> 35:05.688
Stilts? No, I'm sure there's a pool.

35:17.574 --> 35:18.993
Cuff yourselves.

35:26.000 --> 35:27.584
Not this again.

35:39.763 --> 35:41.557
Riggs! Where you at?

35:42.266 --> 35:44.685
Stay where you are. Don't move.

35:45.269 --> 35:46.562
You all right?

35:46.770 --> 35:48.022
Move that truck.

35:49.732 --> 35:50.733
Give me your keys!

35:53.235 --> 35:54.486
You all right?

35:55.237 --> 35:56.238
Where you going?

35:56.405 --> 35:57.906
That was the hotel waiter.

35:58.073 --> 35:59.116
Wait for me!

35:59.783 --> 36:00.993
Get out of here!

36:01.201 --> 36:05.080
What are you doing? You can't
take my truck! What's going on?

36:07.916 --> 36:10.044
Don't worry.
We'll bring it right back.

36:17.217 --> 36:18.260
Gotcha!

36:18.427 --> 36:20.763
Sergeant, it's the guy from the hotel!

36:21.013 --> 36:22.264
Where did he go?

36:23.098 --> 36:24.933
Riggs is hanging on the truck!

36:25.142 --> 36:28.562
What are you doing out of the car?
Get in the car!

36:29.396 --> 36:31.648
LEO:
Get back! It's police business!

36:32.066 --> 36:34.902
It's a high-speed chase!
Get out of the way!

36:35.778 --> 36:38.072
[SIREN WAILS]

36:53.962 --> 36:56.757
Go faster! We gotta catch him
and your partner.

37:12.147 --> 37:13.649
Hello, asshole!

37:43.595 --> 37:45.848
Come on, come on. Give me that!

38:01.864 --> 38:04.408
LEO:
There they are! Hurry up!

38:04.658 --> 38:06.535
Come on! Can't you go faster?

38:06.702 --> 38:08.745
MURTAUGH:
Will you shut the fuck up?

38:16.253 --> 38:17.337
Look out!

38:59.171 --> 39:00.589
Oh, shit!

39:06.720 --> 39:08.263
LEO:
Watch out!

39:26.448 --> 39:28.700
Wipeout! It's all under control.

39:28.909 --> 39:30.911
LEO:
I told you to look out!

39:33.288 --> 39:36.083
LEO: You're too old to drive this car.
MURTAUGH: Shut up!

39:36.458 --> 39:37.501
And stay!

39:37.709 --> 39:39.461
What do you think I am, a dog?

39:53.725 --> 39:55.310
Hands behind your neck!

40:00.440 --> 40:03.777
What are you doing here?
We got a lot to talk about.

40:03.986 --> 40:05.153
RUDD:
What's going on?

40:05.320 --> 40:06.488
Freeze, dickhead!

40:07.739 --> 40:10.325
Get down here, dickhead.
It's been a bad day.

40:10.534 --> 40:11.743
Show me your hands.

40:11.952 --> 40:13.870
Take it easy, officer.

40:14.162 --> 40:17.374
I'm not armed. I won't resist.

40:18.333 --> 40:21.336
Put down your guns, gentlemen.
It's all right.

40:21.670 --> 40:23.255
Do as I say!

40:27.759 --> 40:29.469
COP:
Get your hands on your head.

40:29.803 --> 40:31.346
Lace them behind your head!

40:31.555 --> 40:33.348
You have no idea what you're doing.

40:33.890 --> 40:37.978
We're professional police officers.
We do this for a living.

40:38.478 --> 40:40.355
My name is Arjen Rudd.

40:40.647 --> 40:45.152
I'm minister of diplomatic affairs
for the South African Consulate.

40:46.069 --> 40:48.030
South Africa,
home of the Krugerrand.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.823
Among other things.

40:50.073 --> 40:52.868
These gentlemen also work
for the consulate.

40:53.035 --> 40:55.370
We have diplomatic credentials...

40:57.372 --> 40:58.999
Keep your hands high.

41:03.003 --> 41:04.296
Give me that.

41:07.591 --> 41:10.427
Everybody take it easy.
Especially you, Riggs.

41:10.677 --> 41:13.513
Riggs? You Martin Riggs?

41:13.889 --> 41:16.850
Of the Chicago Riggses.
What's your name?

41:17.351 --> 41:18.685
Pieter Von... Vor...

41:18.894 --> 41:20.729
Fuck, I'll just call you Adolf.

41:21.688 --> 41:24.524
Are you Arjen Rudd? Aryan...?

41:25.859 --> 41:27.819
- That's you.
MURTAUGH: It's official.

41:29.112 --> 41:30.405
They are official.

41:31.323 --> 41:33.575
Under the Diplomatic Relations Act...

41:33.909 --> 41:37.454
...no diplomatic agent
may be detained or arrested...

41:37.704 --> 41:40.749
Once his identity
has been established.

41:42.626 --> 41:46.046
We do have a serious
diplomatic situation here...

41:46.421 --> 41:49.883
...which I'll take up with your
State Department tomorrow.

41:50.092 --> 41:53.095
I'm quaking in my boots,
but I'll still bring you down.

41:54.221 --> 41:55.972
My dear officer...

41:57.099 --> 41:59.893
...you could not even give me
a parking ticket.

42:03.105 --> 42:05.065
Who is the dickhead now?

42:08.402 --> 42:11.405
This house is owned by
the South African government.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.657
This is South African soil.

42:13.907 --> 42:15.659
Now get out of here.

42:16.785 --> 42:17.911
All of you.

42:19.079 --> 42:20.163
Okay.

42:22.749 --> 42:24.292
Come on, let's go.

42:26.753 --> 42:28.088
Hey, man, don't do it.

42:28.296 --> 42:32.968
Don't fucking do it. Fuck with me,
and I'll make you eat this thing.

42:35.429 --> 42:36.638
<i>Kaffir!</i>

42:38.515 --> 42:41.309
RIGGS: With those credentials,
Chuck Manson could get off.

42:41.518 --> 42:43.812
- I went to school with him.
- Yeah, right.

42:45.647 --> 42:48.984
Miss, could you step out
of the car, please?

42:50.944 --> 42:53.155
Put them away. I'm sorry.

42:54.906 --> 42:56.324
I'm sorry. Are you...?

42:58.201 --> 42:59.286
Don't open that.

43:00.454 --> 43:01.997
That is a diplomatic pouch...

43:02.205 --> 43:05.917
...protected under Article 27
of the Vienna Convention.

43:06.293 --> 43:08.170
Is he serious with this stuff?

43:08.670 --> 43:09.671
Yes.

43:09.921 --> 43:12.549
These are police officers,
Miss Van Den Haas.

43:12.966 --> 43:14.301
They were just leaving.

43:17.012 --> 43:18.847
She is a consulate secretary.

43:19.848 --> 43:21.558
Give her back the briefcase.

43:24.519 --> 43:25.854
Give it to her.

43:28.190 --> 43:30.859
Here. I'm sorry,
Miss Consulate Secretary.

43:31.359 --> 43:32.444
It's only papers...

43:32.652 --> 43:34.196
Don't talk to them! Come here.

43:34.446 --> 43:37.199
He's a nice guy.
What's he paying you an hour?

43:37.365 --> 43:40.076
How'd you like to increase your pay?
Better hours?

43:47.375 --> 43:49.878
RIGGS: I'd start getting used
to that sort of view.

43:59.012 --> 44:01.097
- It's the Triangle Trade again.
- The what?

44:01.348 --> 44:04.059
Didn't you ever do American history
at school?

44:04.226 --> 44:06.102
From molasses to rum to slaves.

44:06.353 --> 44:08.480
Now it's drugs to dollars
to Krugerrands.

44:08.688 --> 44:12.484
I know there's a dead guy
with a surfboard where his face was...

44:12.692 --> 44:16.112
...and the State Department's
breathing down our throats.

44:16.363 --> 44:20.784
I'll have to make a formal apology
to the South African Consulate.

44:21.034 --> 44:22.202
Apologize?

44:22.410 --> 44:24.704
He's a sack of shit!
He's dirty, a crook.

44:24.913 --> 44:27.624
It doesn't matter if he's dirty.
He's a diplomat.

44:27.874 --> 44:32.128
He's got immunity. We can't
touch him, arrest him, prosecute him.

44:32.379 --> 44:34.548
Is that clear?
Does that spell it out?

44:34.714 --> 44:35.757
Yes, sir.

44:35.924 --> 44:39.553
- Who the hell is this guy?
- Leo Getz. Nice to meet you, sir.

44:41.429 --> 44:46.101
You took a civilian on a bust.
A civilian you're supposed to protect!

44:46.309 --> 44:49.271
- He's alive, isn't he?
- It's okay. I signed a waiver.

44:49.521 --> 44:52.941
- Besides, I usually wait in the car.
- Usually? Usually?

44:53.149 --> 44:55.235
They're very adamant about that.

44:55.443 --> 44:58.613
- I don't give a fuck.
- They're good cops. They're the best.

44:58.822 --> 45:01.116
One time, a guy was waving a gun...

45:01.324 --> 45:02.617
What'd he say?

45:04.786 --> 45:05.829
What did he say?

45:06.079 --> 45:08.415
"I don't give a fuck."
It's his mantra.

45:08.623 --> 45:11.751
Why is everybody's ass parked
on my desk? Up! Up!

45:13.128 --> 45:14.546
It's a rubber plant!

45:14.838 --> 45:17.757
I had nothing to do with it.
Looks like a week's supply.

45:17.924 --> 45:18.967
Go spit.

45:19.134 --> 45:22.304
I'm sorry, I forgot.
You're too old for that shit.

45:24.973 --> 45:27.559
COP: If you don't like it,
you can exchange it.

45:44.159 --> 45:45.785
Thank you, Mr. Rudd.

45:51.207 --> 45:53.501
One moment, Miss Van Den Haas.

45:57.839 --> 46:00.967
I hope you understood
what was happening here today.

46:01.176 --> 46:04.012
I'd rather not jump
to any wrong conclusions.

46:04.387 --> 46:06.514
Why don't you explain it to me?

46:06.890 --> 46:11.394
The policies of our government are not
popular here in America, as you know.

46:11.728 --> 46:15.398
The police department of this city
is overrun with blacks.

46:16.024 --> 46:19.110
They have badges and guns,
and they hate us.

46:19.694 --> 46:21.863
Our consulate, its staff...

46:22.197 --> 46:26.493
...and particularly myself will always
be targets for their harassment.

46:34.000 --> 46:35.752
Good night, Mr. Rudd.

46:47.138 --> 46:49.057
RUDD:
Things are getting out of hand.

46:49.265 --> 46:51.518
We are suffering too many losses.

46:51.893 --> 46:54.646
We have to move the cash
in one large shipment.

46:54.896 --> 46:57.273
PIETER: We'll need something bigger
than a suitcase.

46:57.524 --> 47:01.403
RUDD: I'll worry about that.
You worry about the police.

47:01.569 --> 47:04.280
Your warning did not work.

47:12.747 --> 47:14.165
- Let's go!
- I'm coming.

47:14.374 --> 47:16.543
Come on! Move!

47:16.793 --> 47:19.087
Okay! Hey, they're cops, okay?

47:19.254 --> 47:22.090

01:48:17.659 --> 01:48:19.994
Rog, in my pocket.

01:48:26.167 --> 01:48:27.543
Here you go, buddy.

01:48:27.752 --> 01:48:30.880
I want you to throw those things away.

01:48:31.089 --> 01:48:33.758
Those things will kill you. Really.

01:48:39.764 --> 01:48:41.683
You son of a bitch!

01:48:43.101 --> 01:48:44.519
I thought you were dying.

01:48:45.019 --> 01:48:48.231
I didn't die on your toilet,
I'm not dying in your arms.

01:48:48.439 --> 01:48:50.024
You son of a bitch.

01:48:55.071 --> 01:48:58.491
Are they all gone? The bad guys?
Did you get them?

01:48:58.866 --> 01:49:01.119
They been <i>de-kaffirnated.</i>

01:49:09.919 --> 01:49:12.630
Don't make me laugh! Oh, Jesus.

01:49:15.133 --> 01:49:17.301
Did anyone ever tell you...

01:49:19.512 --> 01:49:22.056
...you really are a beautiful man?

01:49:26.561 --> 01:49:28.479
Give us a kiss before they come.

01:49:30.606 --> 01:49:32.817
Where'd that bullet hit you anyway?

01:49:37.488 --> 01:49:39.073
Don't make me laugh!

01:54:20.771 --> 01:54:22.773
