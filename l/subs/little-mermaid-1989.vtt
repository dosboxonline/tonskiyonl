32:29.511 --> 32:31.775
[Seahorse] Sebastian!

32:31.846 --> 32:35.680
[pants] Sebastian, I've been
looking all over for you.

32:35.750 --> 32:37.980
I've got an urgent message
from the sea king.

32:38.053 --> 32:40.214
The sea king?

32:40.288 --> 32:43.780
He wants to see you right away.
Something about Ariel.

32:43.858 --> 32:46.520
[gasps] He knows.

32:46.594 --> 32:49.495
[laughs] Hey, let's see now.

32:49.564 --> 32:53.761
Oh, who could the lucky merman be?

32:56.036 --> 33:00.837
[clears throat] Come in, Sebastian.

33:00.908 --> 33:04.071
[inhales sharply] I mustn't overreact.

33:04.144 --> 33:07.511
I must remain calm.

33:11.618 --> 33:15.247
[squeaky voice] Yes? [clears throat]

33:15.322 --> 33:18.314
- Yes, Your Majesty?
- Sebastian.

33:18.392 --> 33:21.589
I'm concerned about Ariel.

33:21.662 --> 33:24.995
Have you noticed she's been
acting peculiar lately?

33:25.065 --> 33:30.058
- Oh! Uh, peculiar?
- You know, mooning about.

33:30.136 --> 33:33.867
Daydreaming, singing to herself.

33:33.940 --> 33:35.999
You haven't noticed, hmm?

33:36.075 --> 33:38.908
Oh, well, I...

33:38.978 --> 33:42.379
- Sebastian?
- Hmm?

33:43.416 --> 33:47.352
I know you've been
keeping something from me.

33:47.420 --> 33:50.651
[gulps] Keeping something?

33:50.723 --> 33:52.657
About Ariel?

33:55.795 --> 33:59.231
- Ariel?
- In love, hmm?

33:59.298 --> 34:04.826
[whimpers] I tried to stop her, sir!
She wouldn't listen!

34:04.903 --> 34:08.031
I told her to stay away from humans!
They are bad!

34:08.106 --> 34:12.839
- They are trouble!
- Humans? What about humans?

34:12.911 --> 34:16.472
Humans? [chuckles nervously]

34:16.581 --> 34:21.245
Who said anything about humans? [yelps]

34:21.286 --> 34:21.453
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

34:21.487 --> 34:25.753
Flounder, why can't you just
tell me what this is all about?

34:25.824 --> 34:29.453
You'll see. It's a surprise.

34:29.527 --> 34:31.587
Oh, Flounder.

34:33.665 --> 34:35.656
Flounder, you're the best!

34:35.734 --> 34:40.295
It looks just like him.
It even has his eyes.

34:40.371 --> 34:45.434
[giggles] Why, Eric, run away with you?

34:45.509 --> 34:49.206
Oh, this is all so... so sudden.

34:49.280 --> 34:51.304
[laughs]

34:51.382 --> 34:52.542
[gasps]

34:52.616 --> 34:54.550
Daddy?

34:57.955 --> 35:01.948
I consider myself a reasonable merman.

35:02.026 --> 35:06.986
I set certain rules,
and I expect those rules to be obeyed.

35:07.064 --> 35:08.554
But, Dad, I...

35:08.632 --> 35:11.896
Is it true you rescued
a human from drowning?

35:11.968 --> 35:12.957
I had to...

35:13.036 --> 35:16.631
Contact between the human world
and the mer world is strictly forbidden.

35:16.739 --> 35:19.503
Ariel, you know that!
Everyone knows that.

35:19.542 --> 35:23.069
- He would have died.
- One less human to worry about.

35:23.146 --> 35:25.410
- You don't even know him.
- Know him?

35:25.482 --> 35:28.576
I don't have to know him!
They're all the same.

35:28.651 --> 35:31.085
Spineless, savage,
harpooning fish-eaters

35:31.154 --> 35:32.587
incapable of any feeling...

35:32.655 --> 35:35.590
Daddy, I love him! [gasps]

35:35.658 --> 35:39.924
No! Have you lost
your senses completely?

35:39.996 --> 35:41.930
He's a human. You're a mermaid.

35:41.998 --> 35:43.488
I don't care.

35:43.566 --> 35:47.695
So help me, Ariel,
I am going to get through to you.

35:47.769 --> 35:51.637
And if this is the only way, so be it!

35:54.343 --> 35:57.210
Daddy! No!

35:57.279 --> 35:59.873
No! Please!

35:59.948 --> 36:03.645
Daddy, stop! Daddy, stop it!

36:06.388 --> 36:08.583
Daddy, no!

36:18.367 --> 36:20.358
[Ariel sobs]

36:32.113 --> 36:34.047
Ariel, I...

36:34.115 --> 36:36.447
[sobs] Just go away.

36:54.802 --> 37:00.398
Poor child. Poor, sweet child.

37:00.473 --> 37:05.376
She has a very serious problem.

37:05.445 --> 37:08.778
If only there were
something we could do.

37:08.848 --> 37:11.783
But there is something.

37:11.851 --> 37:16.515
Who... Who are you?

37:16.590 --> 37:18.820
Don't be scared.

37:18.892 --> 37:22.123
We represent someone who can help you.

37:22.195 --> 37:27.292
Someone who can make
all your dreams come true.

37:27.367 --> 37:29.392
[both] Just imagine...

37:29.469 --> 37:31.460
You and your prince...

37:31.538 --> 37:35.064
Together forever.

37:35.140 --> 37:37.074
I don't understand.

37:37.142 --> 37:42.978
Ursula has great powers.

37:43.048 --> 37:47.007
[gasps] The sea witch?

37:47.086 --> 37:50.351
Why, that's... I couldn't possibly.

37:50.422 --> 37:53.482
No! Get out of here. Leave me alone!

37:53.559 --> 37:55.789
Suit yourself.

37:56.795 --> 38:00.094
It was only a suggestion.

38:09.707 --> 38:10.731
Wait.

38:10.808 --> 38:14.266
[both] Yes?

38:14.345 --> 38:18.645
- [sniffles] Poor Ariel.
- I didn't mean to tell.

38:18.750 --> 38:21.150
It was an accident. [mutters]

38:21.185 --> 38:24.279
Ariel? Where are you going?

38:24.355 --> 38:26.983
Ariel, what are you doing here
with this riffraff?

38:27.058 --> 38:28.958
I'm going to see Ursula.

38:29.027 --> 38:33.487
[gasps] Ariel, no! No!
She's a demon. She's a monster.

38:33.564 --> 38:36.863
Why don't you go tell my father?
You're good at that.

38:36.934 --> 38:41.735
But... But, I... Come on!

38:57.220 --> 38:58.881
This way.

[gasps, grunts]

39:15.372 --> 39:16.703

39:16.773 --> 39:21.038
[Ursula] Come in. Come in, my child.

39:21.110 --> 39:26.343
We mustn't lurk in doorways. It's rude.

39:26.415 --> 39:30.374
One might question
your upbringing. [chuckles]

39:32.121 --> 39:34.954
Now, then, you're here

39:35.024 --> 39:39.984
because you have a thing for
this human, this prince fellow.

39:40.062 --> 39:45.659
Not that I blame you.
He is quite a catch, isn't he?

39:45.735 --> 39:48.260
Well, angelfish,

39:48.337 --> 39:53.206
the solution to your problem is simple.

39:53.275 --> 39:55.299
The only way to get what you want

39:55.376 --> 39:57.367
is to become a human yourself.

39:57.445 --> 40:00.573
[gasps] Can you do that?

40:02.150 --> 40:07.087
My dear, sweet child. That's what I do.

40:07.155 --> 40:09.180
It's what I live for.
