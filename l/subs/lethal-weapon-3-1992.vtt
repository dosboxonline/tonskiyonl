01:43.392 --> 01:44.478
Riggs, Homicide.

01:44.646 --> 01:46.230
- Nobody's dead.
- Hey, the night's young.

01:46.397 --> 01:47.898
This is sergeant Murtaugh.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.608
Threat or scare?
- It's the real thing.

01:49.776 --> 01:51.326
This gentleman saw the device.
- Yeah?

01:51.361 --> 01:55.070
On parking level 1, near the gas pumps.
I-I wrote the license plate down.

01:55.070 --> 01:56.921
That's okay, sir. Thanks a lot.
You've been real helpful. Clear the way.

01:56.956 --> 01:58.617
- Have you evacuated the building and everything?
- It's a... it's clean.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.202
- Where is the bomb squad?
- They're on the way.

02:00.370 --> 02:01.684
- Good.
- Bomb squad?

02:01.684 --> 02:04.613
- Everything's under control. Let's go.
- Well, listen, Rog, I think we oughtta check this out.

02:04.613 --> 02:07.197
- Hey. Hey, hey. Hey, Riggs.
- What?

02:07.781 --> 02:09.711
- Bomb squad's on the way.
- There's no bomb in there.

02:09.878 --> 02:12.339
- How-how can you be sure?
- Well, because it's a full moon.

02:12.980 --> 02:14.716
Eh-eh, moon, lunar, lunatics.
They're everywhere.

02:14.884 --> 02:16.552
- Hey, is that Greek?
- No, no, Latin.

02:16.719 --> 02:18.883
Latin. Man, you surprise
the shit out of me, you know?

02:19.189 --> 02:21.265
Hey, look, there's no bomb in there.
It's probably a false alarm.

02:21.432 --> 02:23.807
Happens a million times. Guy probably saw
a radio on the back seat.

02:23.807 --> 02:26.645
Hey, hey, hey. Let's not mess with this.
Wait for the bomb squad.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.022
You're right.
You sit tight, I'll be right back.

02:29.190 --> 02:30.285
Hey, hey. Hey, Riggs.

02:30.285 --> 02:32.360
What? You're acting strange, man.
What's the matter with you?

02:32.360 --> 02:34.813
- There's a bomb in that building.
- No, there's not.

02:34.813 --> 02:35.988
- No, there's a bomb in that building!
- There is not.

02:36.156 --> 02:37.647
There's a bomb in that building!

02:37.647 --> 02:39.137
You know how come I know
there's a bomb in the building?

02:39.137 --> 02:40.701
- How?
- Cause I got eight days to retirement.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.534
And I will not make
a stupid mistake.

02:42.534 --> 02:43.954
Look, there is no bomb
in that building.

02:44.122 --> 02:47.648
I will bet vital parts of my anatomy
to the fact. Now, look. Just-just-just look.

02:48.216 --> 02:50.402
Trust me. Okay? Trust me.

02:53.965 --> 02:56.518
That's usually my first mistake.

02:56.926 --> 02:58.385
Hey. Hey, Riggs!
- Yo.

02:58.553 --> 03:00.095
Hey, wait. I'm comin'.

03:00.263 --> 03:01.597
- Hey, Rog?
- Yeah?

03:01.764 --> 03:04.308
- Your insurance paid up?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, of course. Why?

03:04.767 --> 03:08.395
- Cause there could be a bomb in here.
- Oh, God!

03:10.273 --> 03:11.907
I hate it when I'm right.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.493
You really ought to learn
to trust your instincts more often.

03:14.493 --> 03:18.440
- Oh, God.
- First impression can often be the right one.

03:20.328 --> 03:23.535
He's got a leak in his diff. Just about to drop
his drive shaft. No wonder there's a bomb...

03:23.703 --> 03:25.495
Just don't touch it.

03:26.831 --> 03:28.290
Just looking.

03:29.500 --> 03:31.117
Right.

03:33.630 --> 03:37.299
What are you gonna do? Hei, don't-dont
open the door. Don't open the door! Don't open!

03:41.756 --> 03:43.918
Son of a bitch, just look at it.
Just look at it.

03:43.918 --> 03:45.675
That's all I'm gonna do is look.

03:48.728 --> 03:51.492
Oh, my. There's more plastic
than Cher.

03:51.527 --> 03:54.816
I love this job. This is amateur night, Rog.
Open the door. I can't hear you.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.818
Open the door!

03:57.195 --> 03:58.528
Don't do nothin'.

04:00.140 --> 04:01.448
Not that one! Mm-mm!

04:01.616 --> 04:02.908
You son of a bitch.

04:03.138 --> 04:06.245
Well, this is a pretty shonky job.
I think I can dismantle it.

04:06.412 --> 04:09.081
It looks like Beirut to me.
Let's get the hell out of here.

04:12.835 --> 04:16.004
Riggs, everybody's outside. Just me, you
and this cat are dumb enough to be down here.

04:16.172 --> 04:18.017
Nearly a cat-tastrophe, huh?

04:19.492 --> 04:22.386
Relax, Rog. Relax. Right.
- Don't do nothing.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.513
No sweat, Rog. We got nine minutes
and seven seconds left.

04:24.681 --> 04:25.917
Hey, you know what we could do?
Know we can do?

04:25.917 --> 04:26.603
What?

04:26.603 --> 04:29.226
- We could drive this thing outta here.
- Hey, fine, it's your turn to drive.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.270
Oh, shit. No keys.
Tsk, tsk. I could hot-wire it.

04:31.437 --> 04:34.690
Aah! Don't even say "hot-wire"
around this stuff, man.

04:34.857 --> 04:35.939
You're right, you're right,
you're right, you're right.

04:35.939 --> 04:37.284
Why am I doing this?
Why am I...?

04:38.076 --> 04:40.628
Looks like we're gonna have to do it
the old-fashioned way.

04:41.281 --> 04:45.701
Riggs, what are you thinking? Riggs! What're
you doin'? What are you thinking, Riggs? Riggs.

04:45.868 --> 04:47.848
- I'm thinking we should cut the blue wire.
- Hey, wait!

04:47.848 --> 04:48.351
What?

04:48.386 --> 04:50.205
- That's not what I'm thinking.
- What? You think it's maybe the red?

04:50.373 --> 04:51.623
Oh, no. No.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.251
I'm, uh... I'm thinking that it's
eight minutes and 42 seconds.

04:54.419 --> 04:57.995
We can go upstairs, wait for
the bomb squad... have a cappuccino.

04:57.995 --> 05:01.800
The bomb squad never gets here on time, okay?
Anyway, it's eight minutes and 31 seconds.

05:01.968 --> 05:04.353
Rog, please.
- F-forget the cappuccino.

05:04.353 --> 05:05.118
You know what they're gonna say?

05:05.118 --> 05:07.718
Ah, yeah, they will say "We expect
you get the fuck out of here".

05:07.718 --> 05:09.989
That's right. But after that,
they're gonna say "Let's cut the blue wire",

05:09.989 --> 05:11.162
which I'm gonna do right now, Rog.

05:11.162 --> 05:14.521
- Hey. Hey, hey. Wait, wait, Riggs. Wait.
- What?

05:14.689 --> 05:16.940
- How can you be so sure?
- Oh, it's just a hunch.

05:17.108 --> 05:19.318
-You're playing on a hunch?
- Hey, remember the bomb under your toilet?

05:20.012 --> 05:22.571
- Oh, shit. How could I forget?
- Red wire, blue wire, same thing.

05:22.739 --> 05:25.949
This is more simplified, though.
A bit more powerful, but more simplified.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.107
Hey, really, from where I was sitting,
I couldn't see.

05:28.107 --> 05:29.568
Forget it.
Come on, Rog, trust me.

05:29.662 --> 05:30.912
Yeah, so I gotta trust you?

05:31.080 --> 05:33.499
Guess not.
Well, I'm cutting the red wire, okay?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.168
Oh! Oh!

05:36.381 --> 05:39.755
- What? What?
- A minute ago you said blue.

05:40.693 --> 05:43.008
- Did I say blue?
- Riggs, you said blue.

05:43.509 --> 05:44.926
- Well, I meant red.
- You sure?

05:45.261 --> 05:46.970
But... Look, Rog, we can do it
your way if you like.

05:47.138 --> 05:49.264
- My way? I don't have... !
- Quiet!

05:49.432 --> 05:52.669
I'm sure, okay?
- Ah, shit.

05:54.729 --> 05:56.138
You ready?

05:56.731 --> 05:58.440
Rog?
- What?

05:58.941 --> 06:02.152
Won't you kinda miss all this good stuff
when you retire?

06:02.320 --> 06:05.113
Aren't you gonna miss it
a little bit? Huh?

06:07.352 --> 06:09.069
I'm cutting the wire.

06:09.369 --> 06:10.410
Snip. See? All done.

06:13.039 --> 06:14.980
Rog.
- Yeah?

06:16.125 --> 06:18.861
- Grab the cat.
- Grab the cat?

06:18.878 --> 06:21.797
Get back! Take cover!

07:21.732 --> 07:23.191
Where are they?

07:28.656 --> 07:30.073
Bravo.

07:35.037 --> 07:36.371
Oops.

07:37.915 --> 07:39.583
Right. Oops.

07:42.044 --> 07:43.920
Right.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.928
Seven days to retirement,
I'm busted down to patrolman.

07:52.096 --> 07:54.556
I should've cut the red wire.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.808
- You did cut the red wire.
- No, I didn't. I cut the blue wire.

07:56.976 --> 08:00.061
That's what I meant.
We should've waited for the bomb squad.

08:00.229 --> 08:01.897
Am I gonna have
to listen to this every day?

08:02.064 --> 08:04.608
- Every day until I retire.
- That'll be a week too long.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.067
Ah, shit.

08:06.719 --> 08:08.487
My feet are killing me.
- Yeah, your feet are killing me too.

08:08.654 --> 08:11.072
- Well, how can my feet be killing you?
- Cause I gotta listen to you bitch about them!

08:11.240 --> 08:13.855
Yeah, you're right. Listen to me bitch
cause you should've cut the red wire!

08:13.855 --> 08:15.204
I did cut the red wire!

08:16.162 --> 08:19.372
What's this? It's kind of soft.
It's not a bulletproof vest.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.417
It's not gonna keep anything out.
- Gonna keep my stomach in.

08:22.793 --> 08:24.753
What do you got under there?

08:25.254 --> 08:27.672
- It's a girdle.
- What?

08:28.174 --> 08:30.133
Oh, God. It's a girdle.

08:31.093 --> 08:32.219
Trish know about this?

08:32.385 --> 08:34.179
It's not a woman's girdle,
it's a man's girdle.

08:34.635 --> 08:36.890
- They make girdles for men?
- Yeah, they make girdles for men.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.390
- They do, huh?
- Yeah, they do.

08:38.558 --> 08:41.770
I haven't worn this uniform in 15 years.
Cleaners must have shrunk it.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.966
Oh... Well, you should
take it to Chin over in Alpine.

08:43.966 --> 08:47.449
I did take it to Chin over in Alpine.
Look at it. It's shrunk all up in here.

08:48.486 --> 08:50.445
I have to hold my breath there.
- Did you see that?

08:50.613 --> 08:52.948
- See what?
- Jaywalker.

08:53.699 --> 08:54.824
Jaywalking?

08:55.326 --> 08:57.452
Hey, hold it right there, pal.
Can you step up here, please.

08:57.620 --> 08:58.954
- Me?
- Yes, you.

08:59.121 --> 09:00.705
- W-what happened? What did I do?
- Stand there.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.833
What'd you do? Jaywalking. I saw you,
large as life. I'm gonna have to cite you.

09:04.001 --> 09:06.440
Jaywalking?
Oh, Jesus, come on.

09:06.440 --> 09:08.463
Can you handle this on yourself
or should I radio for backup?

09:08.631 --> 09:11.132
- Smart ass... You got the ticket book?
- People are committing actual crimes in this city

09:11.300 --> 09:13.635
and you're hassling me for crossing the street?
- Shut up!

09:13.803 --> 09:14.844
Yeah.

09:16.722 --> 09:17.559
Oh!

09:17.559 --> 09:21.208
You-you know how to fill one of these out?
- A long time ago. Let me see.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.478
Can't read it.
The print is very little.

09:23.646 --> 09:25.397
Without my glasses...
- You're no help.

09:25.565 --> 09:28.817
Can we speed this up, please? You may
have nothing to do. I have things to do today.

09:28.985 --> 09:31.861
No, we can't,
so will you shut up?

09:32.029 --> 09:33.709
Jaywalking.
- Ask for his license.

09:34.323 --> 09:36.199
- Yeah? License for jaywalking?
- Yeah, jaywalking.

09:36.367 --> 09:39.160
I don't have it on me, okay?
I wasn't driving, okay?

09:39.328 --> 09:41.454
I was walking.
What, do I need a walking license now?

09:41.622 --> 09:44.082
- Oh, let's just shoot him.
- Oh, oh, oh, what is he crazy?

09:44.250 --> 09:47.197
Get out fo the way, Roger. I'm gonna drill him.
We can make it look like suicide.

09:47.197 --> 09:50.297
Get out of the way!
- No, no, no. The video cameras. Video cameras.

09:50.464 --> 09:51.923
I don't care!
I'm still gonna drill him!

09:52.091 --> 09:55.427
Get out of here, before my partner kills you!
Go that way, not that way!

09:55.595 --> 09:56.636
This way! Over there!

09:56.804 --> 09:59.598
Go, run! Now! Run!
- Right there, yeah.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.566
Hey. Hey!

10:10.026 --> 10:13.695
Hey, wait a minute.
You forgot to sign.

10:14.280 --> 10:17.616
Hey.
- What's that?

10:18.200 --> 10:20.702
Wait a minute.
You forgot to sign the form.

10:20.870 --> 10:23.622
Hey, who are you?
You're not the regular guy.

10:23.789 --> 10:25.957
- He's on vacation.
- On vacation?

10:26.125 --> 10:28.001
Well, who the hell is that?

10:28.961 --> 10:30.211
Get in the truck! Get!

10:37.762 --> 10:39.387
You fucking prick!

10:43.643 --> 10:45.226
- Riggs! Riggs!
- Are you all right?

10:47.146 --> 10:48.521
- Hey, are you a cop?
- Yeah, yeah.

10:48.731 --> 10:51.858
14-60. 14-60. Into pursuit.
Will continue transmission.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.193
Call 911 .

10:53.361 --> 10:56.446
All right, honey.
Let me drive. We're in pursuit.

10:56.614 --> 10:58.865
I'm driving, baby!
Don't worry.

11:05.456 --> 11:08.548
Okay, this fool picked the wrong time
to mess with the wrong lady.

11:08.548 --> 11:09.959
All right, all right, all right.
Just stay close.

11:16.634 --> 11:20.053
Hey, hey, hey. Right behind you, baby.
That's right. Take a good look.

11:20.221 --> 11:23.056
Delores the Road Warrior
is dead on your raggedy ass.

11:32.149 --> 11:33.274
Ram him! Ram him!

11:39.949 --> 11:41.408
- Watch out, Riggs.
- Come on!

11:50.584 --> 11:53.294
- Are you married, sugar?
- What's that? What? Yeah, 24 years.

11:53.462 --> 11:55.922
Yeah, 24 years.
- Yeah, but is it working?

12:01.637 --> 12:04.139
- Hey, you can't get closer? Just get closer.
- I am. I'm getting closer.

12:06.809 --> 12:08.977
Hold on, Riggs! Hold on!

12:17.945 --> 12:20.530
- Hey, hey!
- Hold on! Hold on! We got you.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.115
Hold on!

12:22.992 --> 12:24.868
I told you I could do it.
- Closer! Closer!

12:25.035 --> 12:26.828
- Get me up there.
- Yeah, get up close.

12:26.996 --> 12:28.455
I am. I am, all right?

12:33.794 --> 12:35.003
- Back off, back off!
- Aah!

12:47.433 --> 12:48.585
If he falls, don't hit him.

12:48.585 --> 12:51.071
Don't you worry about nothin', baby.
I got somethin' for you.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.057
Whoa!

13:29.225 --> 13:32.560
Ooh, hoo-hoo! Thanks for the interest,
sugar, but one thing at a time.

13:47.284 --> 13:49.118
- Catch him, catch him.
- All right, all right.

13:51.747 --> 13:53.581
Keep singin', baby. Keep singin'.
Just stay close.

14:00.923 --> 14:01.923
Relax, baby. Relax, baby.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.843
Ho! Ho! Ho! Hey, keep your hands
off my thigh. Keep 'em to you.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.595
My partner's in trouble. You watch out for 'im.
- I got 'im!

14:20.776 --> 14:24.222
- Boy, I'm getting too old for this shit.
- Not for me, you're not, sugar.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.451
You have the right
to remain unconscious.

14:30.828 --> 14:32.287
Anything you say
ain't gonna be much.

14:37.626 --> 14:39.210
- Hey, Riggs. You all right, man?
-Ha!

14:39.378 --> 14:43.298
I'm okay. I think we gotta book this guy
for not wearing his seat belt though.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.126
Hey, that was dynamite driving.

14:45.126 --> 14:49.150
- Hey, hey, hey, no, she's the dynamite driver.
- I'll show you dynamite.

14:49.346 --> 14:52.473
- Whoo!
- Whoo, shuddup. Whoo!

14:52.892 --> 14:56.394
- What you two been up to while I was at work?
- What do you mean? We were in pursuit.

14:56.562 --> 14:59.346
- I saw you kiss 'er.
- No, I didn't kiss her, man. She kissed me.

14:59.346 --> 15:03.026
It looked mutual to me. Wipe that lipstick off
before the guys at the station start talking.

15:03.193 --> 15:04.694
Hey, go spit, Riggs.

15:06.155 --> 15:08.489
You okay? You all right?

15:09.825 --> 15:11.451
Back to bed. Back to bed.

15:11.814 --> 15:13.227
- Morning, guys.
- Hey.

15:13.564 --> 15:14.215
Daddy.

15:14.330 --> 15:17.043
Hey, how about treating your dad
to breakfast today, okay?

15:17.995 --> 15:21.371
- Well, you got six more days to go.
- Laundry service.

15:22.838 --> 15:24.380
Hold this. Hangers?

15:24.548 --> 15:27.187
I'm springing for the soap.
Nah, nothing too fancy, just a little starch.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.313
Hey, that's a cute dog.

15:28.348 --> 15:29.969
- It's a Westie.
- Morning, sweetie. Westie?

15:30.137 --> 15:31.551
Morning, Trish.
- Hey.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.556
Morning, Rog.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.516
- Hey, Nick. Good morning.
- Spare me.

15:35.684 --> 15:37.943
-What? Didn't you brush your teeth?
- Hold it, mister.

15:38.520 --> 15:40.521
I'm... just looking
for some orange juice here.

15:40.689 --> 15:44.067
Don't get any fingerprints on the door,
and put the glass in the dishwasher.

15:44.234 --> 15:45.727
What happened?
Did somebody commit a murder here?

15:45.727 --> 15:47.856
Somebody's coming by
to see the house this mornin'.

15:47.863 --> 15:50.073
Oh. Hey, I think a little mess
adds to the charm.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.038
How's this, huh?

16:02.753 --> 16:04.712
This great? Okay? Okay?

16:06.048 --> 16:07.340
Kelly's Pool Hall.
Kelly speaking.

16:07.508 --> 16:10.426
Yeah, right, Kelly.
Hi, let me speak to dad.

16:10.594 --> 16:13.846
Oh, hi, honey. How you doin'? Look,
I thought I asked you not to call me here.

16:14.431 --> 16:16.836
It's for you, Rog.
- Me?

16:17.434 --> 16:18.775
Hmm?

16:19.061 --> 16:20.728
Uh, who are... ? Who is it? Hello?

16:20.896 --> 16:22.897
<i>Hi, there.
It's my first day at work.</i>

16:23.065 --> 16:24.565
<i>You're gonna come by and wish me luck?
- Rianne?</i>

16:24.733 --> 16:25.733
Beautiful, huh?

16:25.901 --> 16:28.220
Come on, come on, check it out.
- Beautiful lawn.

16:28.362 --> 16:29.654
It's great.

16:29.709 --> 16:31.782
See how quiet it is here?
Listen, listen.

16:32.157 --> 16:33.324
That great? Come on.

16:33.492 --> 16:35.827
- Very quiet.
- The inside's better than the outside.

16:35.995 --> 16:38.746
- It's the people to look at the house.
- And our broker.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.876
Okay, okay.
Just wanna make sure.

16:44.406 --> 16:47.338
I gotta show you this room first.
This is my favorite room. This is great.

16:47.506 --> 16:49.622
Okay? I love it. Is that it?
- Oh, yeah.

16:49.622 --> 16:50.763
That say it all?

16:50.798 --> 16:51.426
- Beautiful.
- Very nice.

16:51.593 --> 16:53.636
Oh, I love that picture window.

16:53.804 --> 16:54.846
Shhhh. Shh.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.906
- You do? It's been completely replaced.
- Oh, why was that?

16:57.906 --> 17:00.852
Oh, a drug dealer came through here
with his car and crashed right in.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.729
Shot up the whole place. Shh.

17:02.896 --> 17:05.106
Son of a bitch.
I'm-a cut him off at the...

17:05.273 --> 17:07.066
- Ha, ha! Leo.
- Oh, ha. Drug dealer.

17:07.233 --> 17:09.527
It's true. Hey, it's true. True.

17:09.694 --> 17:12.864
Okay, okay, anyway, look. Eh, you like
these drapes? Maybe she'll leave the drapes.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.906
- Hey, I thought you quit, huh?
- I did.

17:15.075 --> 17:17.059
You'll stink up the house.
You don't need to smoke.

17:17.059 --> 17:17.690
I'm edgy, I mean...

17:17.869 --> 17:21.247
- You're edgy? Here. Here.
- That stuff about the drug dealer....

17:21.415 --> 17:22.623
Chew on these.

17:22.790 --> 17:24.496
Listen, I had to tell you
these things, okay?

17:24.496 --> 17:27.127
I mean, it's the law.
I-it's called full disclosure.

17:27.296 --> 17:29.589
Anything else you wanna disclose
before we go on?

17:31.091 --> 17:32.491
Okay, okay,
now that you mention it,

17:32.491 --> 17:34.337
the bathroom upstairs
has been completely remodeled,

17:34.386 --> 17:35.928
due to unexpected bomb damage.

17:36.096 --> 17:37.972
Hey, hey, hey,
come on. It's okay.

17:38.140 --> 17:40.016
- Son of a bitch. I'm gonna...
- Shh. Shh.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.226
- Don't. You'll never sell...
- Shh.

17:47.274 --> 17:49.484
Okay, okay. So, uh,
we saw enough of the kitchen.

17:49.651 --> 17:52.629
Okay. Let me show you upstairs.
Wait till you see this. It's beautiful upstairs.

17:52.629 --> 17:53.927
You're really gonna love this.

17:58.827 --> 18:01.496
- They're gone.
- Leo Getz, I guess I'm gonna kill him.

18:01.663 --> 18:04.082
Son of a bitch. I'm-a kill 'im!
I'm-a kill 'im!

18:04.249 --> 18:06.284
- Hey, don't...
- He's tryin' to ruin me, Riggs.

18:07.294 --> 18:08.550
Hey, Leo, you got...

18:08.550 --> 18:10.509
They weren't gonna buy the house anyway!
They weren't gonna buy it.

18:10.509 --> 18:11.766
Yeah, yeah,
you scared them away.

18:11.766 --> 18:12.595
No, no, no,
they weren't gonna buy it.

18:12.595 --> 18:13.999
I think they couldn't
even afford the financing.

18:13.999 --> 18:16.094
- Oh, Jesus.
- Okay, okay, relax, relax.

18:16.261 --> 18:19.597
I had to tell them everything.
It's the law, okay? I mean, full disclosure.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.808
You must have heard of it.
- Hey, I'm a cop. I'm the law.

18:21.975 --> 18:23.017
- Ah!
- Ow!

18:23.185 --> 18:26.062
Get off me! What is it with you?
- Hold it.

18:27.356 --> 18:28.397
Okay, okay.

18:28.565 --> 18:31.234
At least he didn't tell 'em
about that nail-gun incident.

18:31.401 --> 18:33.528
- Oh....
- Hoh, I forgot.

18:33.695 --> 18:36.114
Did you have a permit
when you built over the garage?

18:36.281 --> 18:38.241
- A... permit-permit?
- You know what I'll do? I'll do... Hold it.

18:38.408 --> 18:40.981
Leo's here. I'll take care of it, okay?
I'll make a couple o' calls.

18:40.981 --> 18:43.166
We get some back-dated permits.
I'll take care.

18:43.201 --> 18:45.289
Which phone can I use?
- Uh, the... sunroom. Sunroom.

18:45.457 --> 18:48.042
- Okay, okay, okay. I got you.
- Jesus Christ.

18:48.210 --> 18:50.674
- It's gotta be easier than this.
- They don't know Leo Getz.

18:51.228 --> 18:53.923
You could do with a little less aggravation.
Why don't you come to work with me.

18:54.091 --> 18:57.260
Yeah. Thank you, Leo.
Son of a bitch...

18:57.427 --> 18:59.744
Stop like fronting yourself, man.
You know what I'm sayin'?

18:59.744 --> 19:01.848
Swing with me and my crew.
That's the move.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.365
Forget school.

19:10.983 --> 19:13.200
Oh, man.
Here comes your pops, man.

19:13.735 --> 19:15.611
Later, man.
- All right, I gotcha.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.573
- All right, bro. I'm out, man.
- Next time, G. Peace, bro.

19:21.920 --> 19:23.413
- Morning, Rog.
- How you doing, son?

19:23.413 --> 19:25.447
- How you doing, Mr. Fisher?
- Hey, Nick.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.620
Hey. Hey, Nick!

19:27.749 --> 19:30.376
Uh, wasn't that Darryl?
- Yeah.

19:30.544 --> 19:32.420
Haven't seen him around
in a while.

19:33.505 --> 19:36.924
- He dropped out of high school.
- Those are pretty gang colors he's wearing.

19:37.092 --> 19:38.574
Yeah, I know.

19:39.928 --> 19:41.424
Hey, hey, Nick.

19:42.097 --> 19:45.069
- Yeah, dad.
- Be good.

19:45.309 --> 19:46.809
Word.

19:48.645 --> 19:50.209
Hey, hey, word, Nick.

19:50.647 --> 19:52.106
Word.

19:55.068 --> 19:57.778
- Word, Riggs.
- Word, Rog.

19:58.447 --> 19:59.989
- What are we talking about?
- Word.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.450
Four letters. Starts with a "w",
"or" in the middle, "d" in the end.

20:02.618 --> 20:04.453
Word. Where you been?
- Oh, yeah, that word.

20:04.870 --> 20:07.115
- Word.
- Word.

20:20.594 --> 20:23.638
- Hey, Tyrone, my man, how are you?
- Jack, how's it goin'?

20:23.805 --> 20:25.890
- Let's take a walk.
- Hey, wait up for me.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.809
Look around, Tyrone. This is my dream
and it's all coming true.

20:28.977 --> 20:32.730
You sank your money into this, all the way
out here in the middle of the fucking desert?

20:32.898 --> 20:35.149
That's right. Know why
it's gonna be such a gold mine?

20:35.317 --> 20:36.359
Do tell me.

20:36.526 --> 20:38.669
Cause nobody wants to live
next door to people like you anymore.

20:38.669 --> 20:40.237
You're a menace to society, Tyrone.

20:40.237 --> 20:43.449
Jack, I came out here to do business,
not be insulted by you.

20:43.617 --> 20:44.951
Relax, Tyrone.

20:45.283 --> 20:47.620
Just like houses,
friendships need strong foundations.

20:47.788 --> 20:51.088
Hey, Smitty, come here.
Come here.

20:53.085 --> 20:56.337
What's wrong with you? Don't I
pay you good? Don't I take care of you?

20:56.482 --> 20:57.336
Sure you do, Jack.

20:57.336 --> 20:59.484
Now, what's this stupid business
you and Billy tried to pull up?

21:00.425 --> 21:03.803
- It was a good plan. It worked.
- It didn't work. It didn't work.

21:03.971 --> 21:05.346
You got nailed first time out.

21:05.729 --> 21:08.182
Nobody who works for me
goes into business for themselves.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.642
You understand what I'm saying?

21:09.810 --> 21:12.019
Don't you see how that can jeopardize
everything? Right, Tyrone?

21:12.187 --> 21:13.604
Heh, heh, whatever.

21:13.791 --> 21:16.240
Especially tryin'
to pop an armored car.

21:16.775 --> 21:20.278
Okay, Billy got caught.
There's nothing I can do about that now.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.978
He's gonna have to face the music
on his own.

21:23.365 --> 21:26.492
But you and me, Smitty...
we're gonna start over.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.099
You know what I mean?

21:29.371 --> 21:31.205
- Whatever you say, Jack.
- Good.

21:31.373 --> 21:33.374
Glad you understand
what I'm talking about.

21:40.173 --> 21:42.383
Now we got a relationship
we can build on.

21:44.720 --> 21:47.888
Employee problems. You know how it is?
- Yeah, right.

21:48.267 --> 21:50.975
You invest time and energy
into training somebody.

21:51.143 --> 21:54.353
They get fucking greedy and do
something stupid that jeopardizes everything.

21:54.604 --> 21:55.813
It's a bitch.

21:56.231 --> 21:58.421
Stick around, stick around.
This is the good part.

21:58.567 --> 22:01.861
We can put our initials
in there. Yeah?

22:02.029 --> 22:03.738
Jesus Christ.

22:07.117 --> 22:09.327
Lankershim and Vineland, man.
Where are we going, Rog?

22:09.494 --> 22:13.748
Uh, right here. Rianne's got
a new job. I promised her I'd stop by.

22:13.915 --> 22:15.274
That's a good reason.

22:16.293 --> 22:19.145
All right. Here we are.

22:25.010 --> 22:28.072
- You got any silver, any change?
- We're cops.

22:28.472 --> 22:31.891
That's right, we're cops.
Not crooks. I'll get change.

22:41.193 --> 22:44.278
- Where are you going? Get down!
- Get down! All of you, get down!

22:58.126 --> 23:00.336
Riggs! Riggs!

23:05.509 --> 23:08.469
How do you like that, huh?
What are you doing with a rubber gun?

23:08.637 --> 23:09.741
- Martin, no!
- What?

23:09.741 --> 23:11.066
This is a film. There are not...

23:11.181 --> 23:14.225
Cut, cut, cut!
Who the fuck is this lunatic?

23:14.393 --> 23:16.685
- Get him off my set.
- This isn't part of the story.

23:16.853 --> 23:19.146
- Can we get a cop?
- Where did you come from?

23:19.314 --> 23:20.648
Jesus. Who are you?

23:20.816 --> 23:23.943
Rianne, I'm so sorry.
I feel like a microbe right now.

23:24.111 --> 23:26.404
- You really thought I was in trouble?
- Oh, I did.

23:26.571 --> 23:29.407
- You did?
- A real cop. Go sit in your fucking trailer.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.450
What is wrong with you?
Are you an idiot?

23:31.618 --> 23:32.660
I apologize.

23:32.828 --> 23:36.622
- He's a friend of mine, he's a policeman.
- Yeah, we're both here to visit...

23:36.790 --> 23:38.467
Oh, he's a friend of yours,
all right?

23:38.467 --> 23:42.002
Let me tell you something, okay?
You're fired. All right. Have a nice day.

23:42.170 --> 23:44.004
Fired? Hey, hey, hey, Riggs,
what did you do?

23:44.840 --> 23:48.634
- You're not fired. Don't worry.
- No, you're not. Ta-ta-take it easy, Riggs.

23:48.802 --> 23:50.636
You can't fire her
for something I did.

23:50.804 --> 23:52.972
I don't care whose mistake it was.
She's fired.

23:53.140 --> 23:55.850
- I apologize to everybody.
- Don't push him.

23:56.017 --> 23:57.351
- Don't push.
- All of you, go!

23:57.519 --> 23:59.645
Just take it easy.
Don't-don't push him. Don't push.

23:59.813 --> 24:02.690
- Get off my set, all right?
- What are you, deaf? Go.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.066
Move. Get off my set.

24:04.234 --> 24:06.360
Look, on any normal day,
I'd smack you right in the mouth.

24:06.528 --> 24:08.446
- Oh, is that so?
- Don't hit him.

24:08.613 --> 24:09.905
It's a normal day.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.409
I'm sorry. Listen, are you okay?
I'm sorry.

24:13.577 --> 24:16.787
God, I'm all thumbs. Look, he fell down.
I'm sorry. Let me help you up.

24:16.955 --> 24:18.497
I said don't hit him, Riggs.

24:18.665 --> 24:20.541
- Is she fired?
- Yes, she's fired.

24:20.709 --> 24:22.408
- Is she fired?
- No, no, all right? No.

24:22.408 --> 24:23.650
- It's all right, baby.
- She got a raise?

24:23.650 --> 24:25.880
- Yes. I said yes. Thank you.
- Good.

24:26.591 --> 24:30.050
- Rianne, I... I think you have a new friend here.
- Yeah.

24:30.385 --> 24:31.969
We... we'd like you
to come back.

24:33.680 --> 24:34.988
All right.

24:37.017 --> 24:39.143
When you gonna learn you can't settle
every problem with your fists?

24:39.311 --> 24:40.963
I couldn't use my gun.
There was a crowd.

24:40.963 --> 24:42.754
Hey, hey, man.
Okay, six more days and that's it.

24:42.754 --> 24:44.293
Look, I don't wanna
hear that anymore okay?

24:44.351 --> 24:47.401
Hey, didn't Rianne get her job back?
Didn't she get a raise in pay, did she?

24:47.569 --> 24:49.095
I don't hear a "thank you".

24:49.529 --> 24:52.990
Hey, maybe I should, uh, become one of those
Hollywood agents. What do you think?

24:53.158 --> 24:55.618
- Hmm. Won't work.
- Why?

24:55.785 --> 25:00.063
- Got a killer instinct.
- Heh. Son of a bitch.

25:00.248 --> 25:02.177
We should've put the bag
on the meter like I said.

25:02.177 --> 25:04.297
Okay, I-I forgot. I mean, put it in
the glove compartment, with the rest of 'em.

25:04.297 --> 25:07.254
- No, no, no. I don't do that anymore.
- Oh, yeah? Good man.

25:07.422 --> 25:09.757
It's full up already.
Put it in the back seat.

25:13.845 --> 25:16.957
- You really like those things, huh?
- What, these? Yeah, it's good.

25:19.768 --> 25:23.062
Hey, you know, you can eat a box of 'em.
I'm still dying for a cigarette.

25:26.441 --> 25:29.502
- What, you cut yourself shaving?
- Yeah.

25:29.736 --> 25:33.405
- Old razor?
- Old face.

25:34.991 --> 25:38.573
I think you're really lettin' this
retirement thing get you down, Rog, uh...

25:38.912 --> 25:41.503
Why don't you spend a couple more years,
think it over. Get used to the idea.

25:41.503 --> 25:42.148
Why you wanna quit?

25:42.148 --> 25:44.458
- I got plans for my retirement.
- Oh, yeah, plans. Yeah.

25:44.626 --> 25:46.418
- Yeah, I do. Big plans.
- Sure. Big plans?

25:46.586 --> 25:48.546
- I had them for a long time.
- Yeah? Like what?

25:48.713 --> 25:50.130
Like, uh....

25:51.007 --> 25:53.301
Uh, hey, things, man.
- Things.

25:53.301 --> 25:54.912
- Okay, yeah, huh?
- Things.

25:54.912 --> 25:56.971
Yeah, yeah. Things that
I've put off for too long. Okay?

25:57.138 --> 25:59.074
Oh, those-those things.
Oh, well, I got those things too.

25:59.074 --> 26:00.509
Yeah, yeah, yeah, Riggs. Right.

26:00.509 --> 26:03.879
I can see you've given this
a lot of thought, Rog, actually. Hmm.

26:05.313 --> 26:06.814
Yeah.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.627
I've given it
a lot of thought, Riggs.

26:29.593 --> 26:30.758
Goddamn it!

26:30.880 --> 26:32.047
What the hell is going on?

26:32.215 --> 26:33.841
I'm pissed off! You need a reason?

26:34.009 --> 26:34.960
But I heard gunfire.

26:34.960 --> 26:37.490
- Well, get your hearing checked.
- Put that away.

26:38.138 --> 26:41.860
- What are you looking at?
- Hey, man. Peace.

27:02.996 --> 27:07.666
- Riggs, why'd you call us down here, man?
- Yeah, baby, yeah, baby, Bobby Cute, man.

27:07.834 --> 27:10.711
Hey, how you doing, son?
Your mother know you're here?

27:10.712 --> 27:11.531
Yes.

27:14.215 --> 27:15.799
Hey, did you do this?

27:15.967 --> 27:17.507
- Nice shooting.
- Phew.

27:17.507 --> 27:19.072
Better than Billy the Kid, huh?

27:19.888 --> 27:21.651
Diaper rash
makes you cranky, huh?

27:21.848 --> 27:24.725
Hey, give that to your mom. Maybe
she'll stick it on the refrigerator door.

27:25.181 --> 27:27.209
- Hey, can I borrow your glasses?
- Yeah.

27:27.646 --> 27:30.522
Okay, who's wearin'?
Roger, you're wearing. I need you.

27:30.690 --> 27:34.840
- Why me? You guys should be wearin'.
- Mr. Murtaugh, let me assist you.

27:34.840 --> 27:37.529
I don't need any help. I've been
dressing myself since I was 30.

27:37.529 --> 27:39.653
- Okay, man, just tryin' to help.
- Hey, man, just get back.

27:39.699 --> 27:42.242
All you perverts, turn your heads.
- Take it off, baby.

27:42.410 --> 27:43.519
Now, hold this shirt.

27:44.162 --> 27:45.245
Woo-hoo.

27:45.413 --> 27:46.683
Wearing a girdle, man.

27:47.457 --> 27:49.708
- He's got a girdle!
- Hey, this is no... This is not a girdle.

27:49.876 --> 27:52.895
This is not a girdle. It's-it's my back.
My back went out on me.

27:52.921 --> 27:55.964
- He hurt his back.
- Hurt my back this morning lifting weights.

27:56.132 --> 27:58.676
What you talking about?
I hurt my back this morning lifting weights.

27:58.843 --> 28:01.428
Yeah, I saw him do it.
Okay, everybody, listen up.

28:01.596 --> 28:04.473
I want you all to have a look
at these... lovely bullets.

28:04.998 --> 28:06.600
- These are cute.
- Notice the smooth jacket.

28:06.768 --> 28:10.354
Pay particular attention to the tip.
Good close look at it.

28:13.942 --> 28:17.877
Now, you've all seen one of these vests stop
a .357 Magnum bullet at close range, haven't you?

28:17.877 --> 28:18.931
- Yeah.
- So what?

28:18.931 --> 28:20.656
Yeah? Okay.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.117
Observe.

28:38.133 --> 28:39.569
Son of a bitch.

28:41.720 --> 28:43.317
- Armor-piercing bullets?
- Yeah.

28:43.317 --> 28:44.445
- Jesus.
- Cop killers.

28:44.445 --> 28:45.848
- Shit.
- Serious shit.

28:46.015 --> 28:49.101
Those bullets came from the gun
of a suspect we arrested yesterday.

28:49.269 --> 28:51.658
- Our shark guy?
- Yeah. They're out there on the streets.

28:51.980 --> 28:54.940
Vests are optional, boys and girls.
Especially boys.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.884
- Holy fuck.
- See you, Riggs.

28:57.318 --> 28:59.111
Well, let's just
keep our eyes open.

28:59.279 --> 29:00.988
Cop killers.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.867
Son of a bitch.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.686
I, uh, think we should
talk to Billy Phelps.

29:09.686 --> 29:11.665
I'll have him brought down
for interrogation, okay?

29:12.751 --> 29:14.018
Yeah.

29:19.966 --> 29:22.509
I'm here to talk to a prisoner,
sergeant. Billy Phelps.

29:22.677 --> 29:25.668
- Can I see all your ID there?
- Sure.

29:25.972 --> 29:29.183
Yeah, William Phelps, the armored-car suspect.
He's been moved to interrogation.

29:29.350 --> 29:31.852
Know where that is?
- Sure. Been there a lot.

29:32.081 --> 29:33.145
Okay.

29:42.113 --> 29:43.363
Same floor.

29:43.740 --> 29:45.199
- Hey, Rog.
- Hmm?

29:45.366 --> 29:46.658
I guess now you're retiring,

29:46.826 --> 29:49.707
that, uh, Swiss bank account
is gonna come in pretty handy.

29:50.622 --> 29:53.040
How much you got in there,
a million? Million and a half?

29:53.374 --> 29:55.705
- Five.
- Five.

29:55.877 --> 29:57.377
Well, you deserve it, man.

29:57.780 --> 30:00.476
It's better than those miserable
drug dealers gettin' it.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.549
What are you talking about?

30:06.679 --> 30:08.600
Hey, don't sweat it.
You laundered it, didn't you?

30:08.600 --> 30:10.442
They can't trace it
if you laundered it.

30:10.850 --> 30:12.684
They can't trace it.
- Well, now, heh...

30:13.131 --> 30:16.480
Hey, look, so long as I get an invite
to the Casa de Murtaugh, I'm happy.

30:16.816 --> 30:17.606
Casa what?

30:17.981 --> 30:19.983
- I never been to Portugal.
- Stop joking.

30:20.151 --> 30:21.902
She's a cop, man.
- I know she's a cop.

30:22.070 --> 30:24.571
She's probably on the take too.
What do you take me for?

30:24.739 --> 30:27.157
Come on.
The whole force is bent.

30:27.536 --> 30:28.917
Look, she may be wearing a skirt,

30:28.917 --> 30:30.270
but we're all brothers,
you know what I mean?

30:30.370 --> 30:31.620
No, I don't have nothing there.

30:31.788 --> 30:33.622
I ain't been to Portugal.
- Beautiful.

30:33.790 --> 30:36.583
This, Murtaugh... This...

30:39.170 --> 30:41.338
Son of a bitch.

30:41.696 --> 30:42.548
Hey, how you doing?

30:42.715 --> 30:44.174
- Fine.
- Who is it today?

30:44.342 --> 30:45.634
- Billy...
- Billy Phelps.

30:46.219 --> 30:47.261
Huh.

30:47.428 --> 30:49.054
- Who are you?
- Fly me.

30:49.222 --> 30:51.265
I'm your friendly
Portuguese airline.

30:51.808 --> 30:54.560
- She's Infernal Affairs, Rog.
- How'd you know?

30:54.727 --> 30:58.228
Well, I took the liberty of looking
at your file folder. It was showing.

30:58.606 --> 31:00.357
Lorna Cole.

31:00.650 --> 31:03.360
And you're sergeant Murtaugh.
- I used to be.

31:03.620 --> 31:06.446
Yeah, what's Infernal Repairs
want with our collar?

31:06.614 --> 31:08.735
We're taking over. Thanks.

31:08.735 --> 31:10.717
Nobody told us they were taking over,
did they, Rog?

31:10.752 --> 31:12.740
Well, nobody has to tell you
anything, patrolman.

31:12.740 --> 31:14.290
Well, I'm gonna go and
see the captain. I think he should...

31:14.290 --> 31:15.196
- You wanna go see the captain?
- Yeah.

31:15.196 --> 31:17.090
- All right. Let's go see the captain.
- All right.

31:17.090 --> 31:20.027
- And, uh, put on a vest.
- Oh, are you wearing one?

31:20.027 --> 31:23.297
- Hey, hey, hey. Just take it easy, man.
- Okay.

31:34.601 --> 31:37.269
Hey, guys. Phelps, William.
Actually, his name's Billy.

31:37.437 --> 31:39.397
- Phelps? You too?
- Hi.

31:39.397 --> 31:41.648
- Popular guy today.
- What, you got somebody with 'im?

31:41.816 --> 31:44.643
No, not really.
He's down the hall to the right.

31:44.986 --> 31:47.571
- Wanna sign in here, sarge?
- Sure.

31:47.739 --> 31:49.364
- Miss.
- Thank you.

31:49.532 --> 31:50.579
Captain, what's Internal Affairs
doing here?

31:50.579 --> 31:53.055
Don't start with me, all right?
I just found out myself.

31:53.055 --> 31:53.719
You just found out...

31:53.719 --> 31:55.412
This is Herman Walters,
chief of intelligence.

31:55.580 --> 31:57.497
Herman, you haven't met
his daughter, Lorna Doone, here.

31:57.665 --> 31:59.249
- Cole.
- Pleased to meet you.

31:59.417 --> 32:02.294
The Phelps case has been
transferred to Internal Affairs.

32:02.462 --> 32:04.338
- Why? Tell me why.
- I can't tell you.

32:04.505 --> 32:05.839
- That's classified.
- It's classi... ?

32:06.007 --> 32:08.317
We busted our buns busting this guy.
We busted him...

32:08.317 --> 32:10.531
Busted is right.
He spent the night in county hospital.

32:10.531 --> 32:12.554
- He forgot to buckle up.
- Yeah, we even cited him for it.

32:12.722 --> 32:15.015
- I know. I read your report.
- Yeah.

32:15.183 --> 32:17.851
You know, our cases have
unfortunately crossed paths here.

32:18.019 --> 32:20.354
That's all I can say.
We'll take over from here.

32:20.521 --> 32:22.230
Hey, captain,
what's she talking about here, huh?

32:22.648 --> 32:25.233
- That's classified.
- No, no, I said "captain". I'm talking to him.

32:25.902 --> 32:27.027
I'm telling you...

32:27.195 --> 32:29.363
No, I-I-I said "captain".
No, I'm talking to the captain.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.365
- That's classified.
- I'm talking to him.

32:31.532 --> 32:34.159
- Bullshit!
- Murtaugh. Hey, hey. Riggs!

32:35.954 --> 32:39.122
Look, maybe these guys
can contribute something to this case.

32:39.290 --> 32:40.517
From what I've seen
in their records,

32:40.517 --> 32:42.871
the only thing they do contribute
is mayhem and chaos.

32:42.919 --> 32:45.087
No, I'm Chaos and he's Mayhem.
We're a double act.

32:45.254 --> 32:48.632
What are we, required reading or something?
- As a matter of fact, you are.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.843
It's a cross between "Police Gazette"
and "Mad" magazine.

32:52.011 --> 32:54.513
- What's wrong with "Mad" magazine?
- No, nothing, I used to read it myself.

32:54.681 --> 32:56.846
Oh, well, yeah, you got some taste.
You got some good taste...

32:56.846 --> 32:58.008
When I was 12.

32:58.017 --> 33:00.727
- When you... Yeah.
- Hey, hey. Riggs, let's go.

33:00.895 --> 33:02.896
We busted him, we can talk to him.
- Let's go.

33:03.064 --> 33:05.042
- Captain!
- Riggs! Murtaugh!

33:05.042 --> 33:07.431
- Yeah.
- Get your asses back here.

33:10.613 --> 33:12.406
You'll be needing these.

33:13.241 --> 33:15.075
I'm reinstating both of you.

33:15.743 --> 33:17.577
- Don't you just love him?
- Yeah.

33:18.204 --> 33:20.414
- God.
- No, no, no. You're Murtaugh and I'm Riggs.

33:21.165 --> 33:22.624
You really are a beautiful man.

33:22.792 --> 33:24.751
Yeah, right.
Just get rid of the blues.

33:24.919 --> 33:27.421
They don't go with the ponytail.
- Absolutely not.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.758
Yeah, right.
- And get a haircut.

33:31.926 --> 33:35.303
- Course I won't.
- You just exceeded your authority, captain.

33:35.471 --> 33:37.848
- That's not the way I see it.
- But I think it's the way the chief will see it.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.089
- Will you just take it up with him.
- I think I will.

33:40.089 --> 33:41.768
Catch up with you.
We don't want this screwed up.

33:41.936 --> 33:45.188
You're gonna have to get him
between lunches. Son of a bitch.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.399
Hi, Billy.

33:51.863 --> 33:54.614
- Jack.
- Bye, Billy.

34:01.831 --> 34:03.413
See you, Billy.

34:10.047 --> 34:12.049
Hey, sergeant, did you get
what you need?

34:12.216 --> 34:14.509
Not really. It's a dead issue,
I'm afraid.

34:16.471 --> 34:18.554
How long has Phelps
been doing this?

34:18.723 --> 34:21.422
- Doing what?
- His armored-car thing.

34:21.684 --> 34:24.340
I wouldn't know.
I'm not interested in armored cars.

34:38.076 --> 34:40.034
I don't think
she's telling us everything, Rog.

34:40.203 --> 34:41.536
Yeah, I think you're right.

34:41.704 --> 34:44.498
Boy, these six days
is gonna be rough.

34:44.665 --> 34:47.208
God, be good to me, please.

34:48.628 --> 34:51.254
Shit, son of a bitch knew
there was a camera in the wall.

34:51.422 --> 34:53.255
Look how he's covering up.

34:53.424 --> 34:53.996
Damn it.

34:53.996 --> 34:56.304
He didn't know there was one
in the interrogation room.

34:56.844 --> 34:58.178
- There isn't.
- Yeah.

34:59.055 --> 35:01.494
We installed them
six months ago. Every station.

35:01.494 --> 35:02.474
- What?
- Well, that's great.

35:02.642 --> 35:04.643
Six months they been there,
we don't know anything about it?

35:04.811 --> 35:06.690
This is the police police,
captain.

35:06.690 --> 35:10.482
Oh, police police. That's very good, Riggs.
Can you say that three times in a row, real fast?

35:10.650 --> 35:12.859
- Why, am I getting to you? Am I getting to you?
- You trying to bait me?

35:13.027 --> 35:15.529
- I'm a master of it.
- Well, that figures.

35:15.696 --> 35:18.532
Hey, heh, baiting master. Great, man.
I'll try that on Trish.

35:18.699 --> 35:21.910
Freeze that! Stop it.
Jack Travis.

35:22.122 --> 35:25.956
- Who?
- Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.

35:26.457 --> 35:27.833
He was one of us.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.836
One hell of a brutal cop.
He could beat a confession out of anyone.

35:31.003 --> 35:32.212
One hell of a dirty cop.

35:32.380 --> 35:36.091
I've never seen so many suspensions and
reprimands and charges of misconduct.

35:36.259 --> 35:38.492
Yeah, well, he's also
as tough as they come.

35:39.345 --> 35:41.555
- What happened to 'im?
- I don't know.

35:41.678 --> 35:45.225
His partner and him were on a stakeout.
He went for coffee, never came back.

35:45.637 --> 35:48.006
- Looks like he's had one cappuccino too many.
- Yeah.

35:48.229 --> 35:49.729
We better brief Walters.

35:50.690 --> 35:52.381
Excuse me, cute stuff.

35:52.900 --> 35:55.193
- That's harassment.
- "Cute stuff". That's you.

35:56.154 --> 35:59.823
- Captain.
- Hey, boys, boys. Just the captain.

35:59.991 --> 36:03.410
Your involvement in this case ended
when Billy Phelps hit the floor.

36:03.578 --> 36:06.284
Why don't you go back
and... beat your street?

36:06.828 --> 36:09.666
- Hey, Murtaugh, now's the time to buy.
- Leo, not now.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.793
- Hey, Roger, Roger.
- Hey, no-no-not now, Leo.

36:11.961 --> 36:14.754
No, no. Not-not now.
- We gotta talk, babe, okay?

36:14.922 --> 36:16.798
You're in trouble. You got termites.

36:16.966 --> 36:18.216
- Termites?
- Uh-huh.

36:18.384 --> 36:20.468
- Oh, God.
- You're infested.

36:20.636 --> 36:22.929
The only thing holding up
your house is the paint, 'kay?

36:23.097 --> 36:24.556
Hey, Rog, I think
we should go now.

36:24.556 --> 36:26.687
Leo, could you get a powder
and get the place fumigated?

36:26.722 --> 36:29.019
I think we should go to Evidence
and pull every file we got on this guy.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.479
Hey, I know this guy.
What are you watching, Geraldo?

36:31.647 --> 36:32.898
- What did you say?
- I said I know the guy.

36:33.065 --> 36:35.125
- Leo! How do you know him?
- I've seen the guy before.

36:35.125 --> 36:36.004
You've seen him before?

36:36.004 --> 36:37.777
- Hey, where?
- I don't know, man. I recognize him...

36:37.945 --> 36:40.847
His name's Jack Travis, Leo.
Does that ring a bell? Jack Travis.

36:40.847 --> 36:43.160
Hey, hey, hey.
Hands off the clothes. Okay, baby?

36:43.160 --> 36:45.819
Okay. Okay. I'm thinking,
I'm thinking, all right? Let me think.

36:45.819 --> 36:46.801
- Think.
- Okay.

36:46.871 --> 36:48.496
A big party.
- Okay.

36:48.550 --> 36:51.868
Somebody brought a monkey cause
the monkey knocked over the salad bar.

36:52.251 --> 36:55.295
And this guy... comes in,
introduced me to another guy,

36:55.463 --> 36:57.358
who wants a favor.

36:57.723 --> 36:59.382
I got it. I got it. I got it!
- What?

36:59.550 --> 37:00.383
He got it.

37:00.676 --> 37:02.677
- I remember! I remember!
- You remember! You remember...

37:02.845 --> 37:05.625
Hey, don't do it.
Don't let the earring fool you. Okay.

37:05.973 --> 37:08.141
Hey, hey, we're back. We're back!
- Yeah. Yeah.

37:08.309 --> 37:09.643
- All right. Hey, listen, listen.
- Yeah.

37:09.810 --> 37:11.317
You think
I could get a gun this time?

37:11.317 --> 37:12.805
No!

37:22.365 --> 37:27.202
Okay, this is it. See, these guys always
wanted me to do favors for them.

37:27.370 --> 37:31.248
Like, some guys wanted broads,
another guy wanted Cuban cigars.

37:31.415 --> 37:35.787
Your guy, hockey.
The best seats in the house.

37:37.672 --> 37:40.157
- Where's the seats?
- Yeah.

37:40.716 --> 37:43.468
Uh, probably by the glass.
Around the glass.

37:43.636 --> 37:45.887
Hey, does "needle in a haystack"
mean anything to you?

37:46.055 --> 37:47.555
Why don't we spread out?

37:47.723 --> 37:52.143
You know, if we all take a different
direction, it'd be like old times.

37:52.311 --> 37:55.272
Don't push, lady.
I'm on police business here.

37:55.439 --> 37:57.399
Just take it easy now.

38:09.870 --> 38:13.206
Go! All right!

38:25.136 --> 38:28.263
<i>Los Angeles penalty.
Number 15, Tony Brown.</i>

38:28.431 --> 38:30.390
<i>Two minutes
for high-sticking.</i>

38:30.558 --> 38:32.851
<i>Time, 5:15.</i>

38:39.442 --> 38:41.568
<i>Los Angeles,
shorthanded goal.</i>

38:41.736 --> 38:47.424
<i>Nineteenth goal and 41st point
for number 3, Max Weinberger.</i>

38:51.120 --> 38:54.164
<i>Mr. Jack Travis.</i>

38:54.332 --> 38:57.751
<i>Mr. Jack Travis,
this is the L.A.P.D.</i>

38:58.794 --> 39:02.047
<i>We know you're in here. We know
where you are. Just stay in your seat.</i>

39:02.214 --> 39:04.090
<i>Don't be stupid.</i>

39:04.383 --> 39:06.718
<i>And I'll be there to collect and
escort you out in a minute.</i>

39:06.886 --> 39:10.013
<i>By the way, there's policemen
at every exit, so it's no use trying to run.</i>

39:10.181 --> 39:12.140
<i>- Just stay where you are.
- Smart son of a bitch.</i>

39:12.308 --> 39:14.768
<i>Thank you for your cooperation.
Play on, boys.</i>

39:29.492 --> 39:30.700
Come on, let's go!

39:41.128 --> 39:43.296
Get out of my fucking way!

39:45.966 --> 39:50.011
Ooh! Ooh! Riggs!
Riggs! Roger! Roger!

39:54.392 --> 39:56.434
Ooh! Excuse me. Excuse me.

40:03.651 --> 40:06.361
- Hey!
- Riggs!

40:09.407 --> 40:10.615
You can't be on the ice.

40:15.329 --> 40:16.733
Ooh! Ooh!

40:17.998 --> 40:19.749
I got 'im. I got 'im.

40:21.877 --> 40:24.653
You have the right to remain...
You're under arrest.

40:34.348 --> 40:36.850
- Fucking weasel.
- What the hell's going on here?

40:37.017 --> 40:38.017
I'm L.A.P.D.
L.A.P.D.

40:38.185 --> 40:40.478
I don't care.
You can't be on the ice.

40:40.646 --> 40:43.106
What is this,
a convention?

40:47.736 --> 40:50.280
- I got 'im.
- You're all right, pal. Just stay calm.

40:54.201 --> 40:55.410
Tell my mother, Rog.

40:55.578 --> 40:58.246
- Where did he go?
- Down there. Down there.

41:08.674 --> 41:11.217
Son of a bitch.

41:13.407 --> 41:15.054
He thinks I don't know I'm dying.
I know it.

41:15.222 --> 41:16.209
- No.
- Yeah, yeah.

41:16.209 --> 41:18.577
- You-you're gonna be okay.
- I'm dying, Roger.

41:18.577 --> 41:21.895
- You're gonna be okay.
- I'm choking, okay? I'm choking. See?

41:22.062 --> 41:24.022
This is they do when they die.
I saw them.

41:24.190 --> 41:27.525
- Leo, it's gonna be okay.
- Yeah, well, I'm... I'm numb.

41:27.693 --> 41:29.819
My whole body's numb.
I can't feel it.

41:29.987 --> 41:31.002
- Hey, Leo.
- I'm gonna die, I know it.

41:31.002 --> 41:32.779
- Leo!
- What?

41:33.073 --> 41:34.657
You're lying on the ice.

41:36.577 --> 41:39.496
- That's why I'm cold?
- That's why you're cold.

41:39.663 --> 41:41.831
- That's why I'm numb, huh?
- That's why you're numb.

41:41.999 --> 41:43.708
He shot me.
Look at all the blood on me.

41:43.876 --> 41:46.794
- It's just a flesh wound.
- So it's okay.

41:46.795 --> 41:47.469
You're fine.

41:47.469 --> 41:49.255
- Let's get you up. One, two, three.
- Yeah.

41:49.793 --> 41:51.674
There you go.
You're gonna make it.

41:51.842 --> 41:54.802
He's okay, he's okay.
He's gonna make it. He's alive.

41:54.970 --> 41:56.721
Ooh! Ow, ow!

42:01.185 --> 42:04.771
- Bring him this way, guys.
- I just... I can't believe this. I just...

42:04.939 --> 42:07.190
I can't believe I got shot.
- You'll be all right.

42:07.358 --> 42:08.650
- Hey, Riggs, Riggs, you here?
- Calm down.

42:08.817 --> 42:11.319
We're all the same now.
We all got shot.

42:12.112 --> 42:14.072
- You'll be fine.
- Ouch. That's...

42:14.240 --> 42:17.367
- Relax, Mr. Getz.
- Hey, I'm fine. I'm fine. Nothing wrong with me.

42:17.535 --> 42:18.910
I can take this. Ouch!

42:19.078 --> 42:22.110
Okay, just calm down. We're gonna take care of it.
You'll be out of here tonight. There's no big deal.

42:22.110 --> 42:22.865
Right, I'll be out tonight.

42:22.865 --> 42:24.707
I don't think that's a good idea.
You shouldn't rush this, doc.

42:24.875 --> 42:26.543
- Yeah.
- I think you should rest up, Leo.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.127
A dumdum wound
can be very serious.

42:28.796 --> 42:30.380
What's... what's
a dumdum wound?

42:30.923 --> 42:34.926
You don't know? A guy in the force...
got his thumb shot off by a dumdum.

42:35.094 --> 42:37.136
From the shock,
he was dead two days later.

42:37.304 --> 42:38.930
Dead two days later?

42:39.098 --> 42:40.431
He died from dumdums?

42:40.599 --> 42:43.017
- We'll keep you overnight.
-Yeah, take it slow.

42:43.185 --> 42:45.478
Two days? All right,
we'll keep him two days.

42:45.646 --> 42:47.266
You'll be here two days.
- That Leo's chart?

42:47.266 --> 42:50.872
We'll keep you here. We'll keep you two days,
and then you'll be out as good as new.

42:50.872 --> 42:53.444
- Bye, Leo.
- I should be with... Hey! Ow! Ouch!

42:54.113 --> 42:57.490
- How do you spell "proctological"?
- Rectal exam?

42:57.866 --> 43:00.827
No, you can't do that to Leo.
- Sure we can.

43:00.995 --> 43:03.538
- Why's she taking my... ?
- Please, Mr. Getz. You'll get it when you're ready.

43:03.706 --> 43:06.824
You've been shot in the arm, okay?
Just let her take it. You'll get it back.

43:06.824 --> 43:08.220
- Okay, okay, okay.
- There's a clock in your room.

43:08.220 --> 43:10.837
- Okay, okay, fine. Riggs!
- Yeah?

43:11.005 --> 43:12.422
This look like a dumdum wound?

43:13.173 --> 43:15.550
- Yeah... It sounded like one when it happened.
- Oh, shit.

43:15.718 --> 43:17.254
- Take it easy. Two days.
- All right, all right.

43:17.254 --> 43:18.853
Two days and you'll be out.
No problem.

43:18.853 --> 43:19.679
- All right.
- Okay?

43:19.847 --> 43:22.515
- Hey, I'll see you guys.
- Yeah. We won't make a move without you.

43:22.683 --> 43:24.767
Right. I thought that bullet
sounded different.

43:24.935 --> 43:26.566
- Just relax, okay?
- Hey, I'm fine.

43:26.566 --> 43:27.827
They'll be there
when you get out.

43:27.862 --> 43:29.814
- You own your own house, doc?
- What?

43:29.982 --> 43:31.899
- You don't recognize my face?
- No, sir.

43:32.067 --> 43:33.359
Watch.

43:34.517 --> 43:37.488
About time. These doggy treats
are okay, but l need some human food.

43:37.656 --> 43:38.698
Don't worry about it.

43:38.866 --> 43:41.638
I'm 'bout to make you one of the best
things you ever had in your life.

43:41.638 --> 43:42.331
Good.

43:42.501 --> 43:47.123
- Hey! You ever eat one of my hamburgers?
- I've been lucky so far but I'll take a chance.

43:47.291 --> 43:50.168
That's big yeah.
Hey, Fast Eddie.

43:50.336 --> 43:52.211
- How's business?
- Booming. Can't you tell?

43:52.379 --> 43:53.421
Yeah, I'm looking at it.

43:53.589 --> 43:54.964
You meet my partner?
- Nah.

43:55.132 --> 43:57.967
Look, I wanna cook one
o' those monster burgers for 'im.

43:58.135 --> 43:59.385
- Go for it.
- All right.

43:59.553 --> 44:01.554
- You gonna let him cook?
- Do I have a choice?

44:01.722 --> 44:05.183
- No, you don't have a choice because it's Wednesday.
- Too big to argue with.

44:05.768 --> 44:07.852
Oh, in that case,
give me a McRog.

44:08.020 --> 44:09.937
- Hold the hair.
- Heh, heh.

44:10.105 --> 44:11.147
You wash your hands, man?

44:11.315 --> 44:14.942
All right, keep joking, but I guarantee
you're gonna like this burger.

44:15.110 --> 44:18.905
And you're gonna come back
with your friends.

44:19.073 --> 44:22.008
I haven't got any friends,
you know that, Rog. Well, except you.

44:22.868 --> 44:24.577
He's a comedian
in his spare time.

44:24.745 --> 44:27.413
Oh, yeah?
When is he gonna say somethin' funny?

44:27.581 --> 44:31.209
Hey, uh, you gonna put that out?
You're finished with it, yeah?

44:31.377 --> 44:33.086
Do you mind, huh? Thanks.

44:35.422 --> 44:37.256
Sorry. I was just looking at it.

44:37.675 --> 44:39.342
- Chew on this onion.
-Yeah.

44:39.510 --> 44:42.387
- Yeah. He's quitting, so help him, okay?
- I quit.

44:43.097 --> 44:45.098
I was only looking at it.

44:47.059 --> 44:49.769
Ah. First thing is the fat.

44:49.937 --> 44:52.438
Everybody says "Cut the fat".

44:52.606 --> 44:55.274
My uncle Theodore said "You cut the fat,
you kill the burger". Right, Eddie?

44:55.442 --> 44:57.193
- Yep.
- There's an art to this.

44:57.361 --> 44:59.404
You just can't plop this
on the grill.

45:02.449 --> 45:05.243
Gently coax the flavors out.

45:06.870 --> 45:08.454
- Yo, hey.
- What's the problem?

45:15.754 --> 45:19.132
A little pepper,
then you massage it a little bit.

45:19.299 --> 45:22.927
Just a little bit.
Sweet, sweet meat.

45:25.973 --> 45:27.598
Shit, man, feel it.

45:31.395 --> 45:34.272
Okay, guys. L.A.P.D.
Let me see your hands.

45:34.732 --> 45:36.941
Come on, let me see your hands.
Get them up!

45:37.109 --> 45:40.570
In the car. Get them up there.
Let me see both of them. Come on!

45:45.200 --> 45:46.826
Hey, Riggs.

45:54.752 --> 45:56.127
Riggs!

45:56.754 --> 45:59.255
God, don't you love me?
Five days.

46:07.014 --> 46:08.848
Damn it,
don't do that shit to me.

46:09.016 --> 46:10.433
Riggs, you okay?
- Yeah.

46:10.601 --> 46:12.643
Come on.
Who did it, who did it?

46:14.855 --> 46:17.815
All right, asshole.
I wanna see your hands right now.

46:44.718 --> 46:46.177
Back me up, Riggs!

47:11.954 --> 47:13.598
Darryl?

47:19.378 --> 47:21.754
Oh, fuck, no. Fuck! Fuck, no!

47:25.050 --> 47:28.719
Hey, call-call an ambulance.
Riggs, call an ambulance. Breathe.

47:29.263 --> 47:30.489
You breathe.

47:31.373 --> 47:32.576
Breathe.

47:32.683 --> 47:34.596
Hey, call an ambulance, Riggs.

47:35.769 --> 47:37.854
Hey, come on.
Breathe. Oh, God.

47:38.021 --> 47:39.689
Fuck, it's Darryl.

47:40.399 --> 47:41.774
Darryl, breathe.

47:41.942 --> 47:43.609
Oh, God, don't do this to me.
Breathe.

47:43.777 --> 47:45.184
- He's dead, Rog.
- Fucking breathe!

47:45.184 --> 47:45.630
He's dead.

47:45.630 --> 47:48.865
- Breathe! Oh, God, don't do this to me.
- He's dead, Rog.

47:49.032 --> 47:51.409
He's dead, Rog.
Rog, he's dead.

47:51.577 --> 47:53.703
He's dead, Rog. He's dead.
Come on. Don't mess with it, man.

47:53.871 --> 47:57.453
He's dead. Come on, man,
it was a clean shoot.

47:57.624 --> 47:59.500
It's okay,
it was a clean shoot.

47:59.787 --> 48:01.669
He was gonna do you,
he was gonna do me.

48:02.296 --> 48:03.462
It's okay. You okay?

48:04.423 --> 48:06.132
It's not okay.

48:06.466 --> 48:09.135
- What?
- I know that kid.

48:11.471 --> 48:12.763
I know that kid.

48:14.308 --> 48:16.309
He's Nick's friend.

48:33.994 --> 48:35.953
- Got it, mom.
- I'll get it.

48:36.121 --> 48:39.332
Hello? Hi, Martin.

48:39.750 --> 48:41.250
He's not here.

48:48.550 --> 48:50.635
Oh, my God.

48:53.221 --> 48:54.847
Thanks.

49:23.794 --> 49:25.711
Fuck! Fuck!

49:31.593 --> 49:33.386
Hey, Sean, how you doing? Taking your vitamins?
Still a little moist around here

49:33.553 --> 49:35.680
- Riggs, how's Murtaugh?
- He's good. He's fine.

49:35.847 --> 49:37.223
Morning, captain.

49:37.391 --> 49:40.393
- I'm sure he's anything but fine, Riggs.
- Oh, really, he's okay.

49:40.560 --> 49:43.604
- I'd really like to talk to him.
- I don't think that's a good idea.

49:44.092 --> 49:46.357
No, I think the best thing you could do
for him is leave him alone.

49:46.525 --> 49:50.069
- Let's, uh, get something for your cold.
- I know what I'm talking about, Riggs.

49:51.386 --> 49:52.654
You and I have to talk, Riggs.

49:52.654 --> 49:54.745
Oh, really? I don't think so.
Talking to you is bad for my image.

49:54.745 --> 49:56.367
- I'm afraid I insist.
- Oh, you insist?

49:56.535 --> 49:58.948
You ins... Well, in that case,
let's find somewhere a little more private.

49:58.948 --> 50:00.960
Here, step into my orifice.

50:03.792 --> 50:04.339
Here.

50:06.837 --> 50:08.337
Hey, Becker,
how's it hanging?

50:08.505 --> 50:09.755
- Hey, Riggs.
- Yeah.

50:09.923 --> 50:13.711
- Clip any wrong wires lately?
- Ah, no, I haven't done that for a couple days. No.

50:13.719 --> 50:15.970
- Hey, next time, wait for the bomb squad.
- Bomb squad.

50:16.138 --> 50:17.221
Yeah, come on, it's our job.

50:17.389 --> 50:20.182
Okay, I'll remember that. We saved a cat.
What do you want?

50:20.350 --> 50:23.060
- Great. And I love cats.
- Hey.

50:24.187 --> 50:25.813
Go ahead, talk. I'm listening.

50:25.981 --> 50:29.775
You purposefully withheld information
concerning a case under my investigation.

50:29.943 --> 50:33.320
-Yeah, damn right I did.
- Careful, Riggs, she's Internal Affairs.

50:33.488 --> 50:36.240
You had a tip on Travis,
you should have shared it with me.

50:36.408 --> 50:38.034
No, I take that back.

50:38.201 --> 50:40.786
You were required
to share it with me.

50:40.954 --> 50:43.330
- I was required to share it with you?
- Yeah.

50:43.498 --> 50:45.458
Hey, I don't have
to share shit with you, honey.

50:45.625 --> 50:48.878
This is school yard rules. If you don't
scratch my back, I don't throw you...

50:49.046 --> 50:51.797
- Oh, come on, Riggs. I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

50:51.965 --> 50:54.884
Why don't you cut out
this classified bullshit?

50:55.052 --> 50:57.219
Right now.
It's giving me the shits!

50:57.387 --> 51:00.139
We're cops. You're a cop, I'm a cop.
We're both on the same side, right?

51:00.307 --> 51:01.474
Right? Right?
- Right!

51:01.641 --> 51:04.727
Right? Good.
Why don't we start to act like it, huh?

51:04.895 --> 51:06.812
Come on, there's kids
out there. Babies.

51:06.980 --> 51:08.981
No brains,
but they got automatic weapons.

51:09.149 --> 51:12.276
Yesterday, my partner, he nailed this kid...
- I know about Murtaugh.

51:14.196 --> 51:17.156
- Yeah?
- Yeah. And I'm sorry, Riggs.

51:18.116 --> 51:19.509
Yeah.

51:22.621 --> 51:24.039
Look, uh....

51:24.456 --> 51:26.957
Look, why don't you let me in on this?
I can help you.

51:27.125 --> 51:30.283
I really wanna help you,
if you'll let me. Let me.

51:30.504 --> 51:32.588
Come on, what do you say?
We got a deal?

51:36.510 --> 51:37.843
Wash your hands, Riggs.

51:40.430 --> 51:43.307
And, um,
meet me in my office.

51:43.642 --> 51:47.144
Yeah, yeah. Okay.
I'll be right there.

51:48.980 --> 51:50.022
Be right there.

51:50.899 --> 51:52.650
MAC-10, 9 mm, semi-automatic...

51:52.818 --> 51:55.945
- ... converted to automatic...
- ... with 36 rounds in the magazine.

51:56.113 --> 51:59.782
On a sesame-seed bun. Very illegal.

51:59.950 --> 52:02.868
- That gun has a history. You wanna know about it?
- Tell me.

52:05.903 --> 52:08.999
Killed a convenience-store clerk
in L.A. County, July 1990.

52:09.167 --> 52:13.587
It was used in a drive-by shooting
in San Bernardino County, August 1990.

52:13.755 --> 52:18.717
It's confiscated by a truant officer of the L.A. County
Unified School Board, October 1990.

52:18.885 --> 52:21.512
Scheduled for destruction by the L.A.P.D.
six weeks ago.

52:21.680 --> 52:24.140
- Scheduled for destruction?
- Yeah.

52:24.307 --> 52:26.156
But it never got there.

52:28.353 --> 52:31.313
Instead, it found its way
into the hands of a 15-year-old boy,

52:31.481 --> 52:33.732
who fired it at a police officer,
your partner.

52:33.900 --> 52:37.236
- Thought it looked familiar.
- That gun and 15,000 others like it

52:37.404 --> 52:41.031
were stolen from a police department storage
facility before they could be destroyed.

52:41.199 --> 52:44.633
I mean, they should be paper clips
right now or-or license plates or I don't know.

52:44.633 --> 52:47.913
Anything but a gun. I mean, here we are,
busting our asses on the streets

52:48.081 --> 52:52.293
trying to get these weapons out of circulation
and now they're headed right back out.

52:52.440 --> 52:55.004
When you busted Billy Phelps,
you stumbled onto something

52:55.172 --> 52:57.256
the department's
been trying to keep a lid on.

52:57.424 --> 53:00.801
That's why Internal Affairs is on this, isn't it?
Cause they think it's an inside job.

53:00.969 --> 53:03.554
Yeah, that's right.
They knew police procedures.

53:03.722 --> 53:05.973
They knew where the guns were stored
and how to get in.

53:06.141 --> 53:08.434
They even knew the sorting codes
on the sides of the containers,

53:08.602 --> 53:11.395
because they took the automatics
and left the junk behind.

53:11.563 --> 53:14.273
It all pointed to a cop.
- Or an ex-cop.

53:14.566 --> 53:16.609
- Right. Travis.
- Travis.

53:19.279 --> 53:21.363
And you let him slip
through your fingers.

53:22.616 --> 53:26.076
- That's closer than you ever got.
- Close, Riggs?

53:26.244 --> 53:29.288
Close is a lingerie shop
without a front window.

53:32.000 --> 53:34.996
You wanna go for a ride?
- Sure, where we goin'?

53:35.795 --> 53:37.379
Surprise.

53:42.052 --> 53:43.852
Oh, I love surprises.

53:44.387 --> 53:45.763
What is this place?

53:45.931 --> 53:48.432
I accessed Billy Phelps'
phone records on my computer.

53:48.600 --> 53:50.392
He made a dozen calls
to this address.

53:50.560 --> 53:52.728
That was nice of you
to steal that information?

53:52.896 --> 53:53.938
Semantics, Riggs.

53:54.105 --> 53:57.149
Semantics?
Oh, I'm always up for some antics.

53:57.859 --> 54:02.655
- All right, let's go on three. One...
- Uh, on three, or three and then go?

54:02.822 --> 54:04.531
- What?
- Oh, never mind. One, two, three.

54:07.911 --> 54:08.885
Gotcha.

54:23.176 --> 54:25.261
Looks like Billy's grandmother
owns a big dog.

54:25.428 --> 54:27.012
That is no a dog.
It's a horse.

54:27.681 --> 54:29.640
I hate dogs, Riggs.

54:30.267 --> 54:32.476
- I don't get it.
- You don't get what?

54:32.644 --> 54:34.603
That's a dog.
It's a fucking dog.

54:34.771 --> 54:39.588
No, no, I don't get "Close is a lingerie shop
without a front window." I don't get that.

54:39.985 --> 54:41.699
Riggs, later.

54:46.157 --> 54:48.867
What are you doing?
- Well, I can't shoot a dog.

54:49.035 --> 54:50.774
People, okay, but not dogs.

54:51.096 --> 54:53.330
I think I... should try
and make friends with him.

54:53.498 --> 54:55.719
- Make friends?
- Yeah.

54:56.001 --> 54:59.712
Now, don't run, because he'll only
chase you down and kill you.

54:59.879 --> 55:00.970
Uh-huh.

55:02.173 --> 55:05.092
Here, boy. Here, boy.

55:12.517 --> 55:15.227
- Yes. Good boy. Yes.
- Shit.

55:22.569 --> 55:23.819
Riggs.

55:29.200 --> 55:30.492
You're crazy.

55:50.597 --> 55:53.557
Want one? Want one?
You hungry? Huh?

55:55.268 --> 55:56.769
You're a hungry boy.

55:56.936 --> 55:59.271
Doesn't anybody feed you?
Come on.

55:59.689 --> 56:01.690
What a good fella.

56:01.858 --> 56:04.151
Here. Here's more.
Leave some for me.

56:04.319 --> 56:08.280
Very slowly, as if you're not here,
just walk away.

56:08.458 --> 56:11.533
-You want me to go?
-Yeah. This is a guy sort of thing.

56:11.701 --> 56:14.495
- Guy sort of thing?
- Are you all alone in here?

56:23.797 --> 56:24.963
Stay, stay.

56:27.092 --> 56:28.801
Come on, let's go.

56:39.771 --> 56:41.647
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Watch.

56:41.815 --> 56:43.148
On two.

56:49.989 --> 56:51.865
- All right, how many is that?
- Fifty-five.

56:52.033 --> 56:55.327
Fifty-five. All right, we got eight more.

56:55.495 --> 56:57.662
All right, we'll get these later.
Let's go.

57:01.334 --> 57:04.670
Hi, fellas.
What's in all these boxes?

57:15.598 --> 57:19.768
Easy, Earl, let's not kill him yet, huh?
Let's see who he is first, all right?

57:22.147 --> 57:23.689
You have the right
to remain silent.

57:23.857 --> 57:25.607
Shut him up.

57:25.775 --> 57:27.985
Sergeant Martin Riggs, heh.

57:30.029 --> 57:32.114
Hubie, get the truck ready.
- Right.

57:32.282 --> 57:33.782
So, sergeant Riggs...

57:33.950 --> 57:35.534
how did you find us?

57:35.702 --> 57:36.994
Freeze. Police!

57:38.663 --> 57:39.872
Oh, another one?

57:40.290 --> 57:41.874
We need a new fucking dog.

57:42.041 --> 57:43.876
Get your hands up,
asshole.

57:44.043 --> 57:45.775
Get them up.

57:49.174 --> 57:51.383
A little bit higher.
That's better.

57:52.886 --> 57:54.511
Very good.

57:58.475 --> 58:00.309
Drop it, miss.

58:01.978 --> 58:02.772
Now, look...

58:51.277 --> 58:53.737
Okay, I'm on. No, I'm not.
Wait!

58:53.905 --> 58:56.573
Wait. Wait, wait! Wait!

59:00.036 --> 59:03.413
Sergeant Cole!
- Get down! Get down!

59:06.960 --> 59:08.544
Get those cases
and kill that dog.

59:20.765 --> 59:23.141
Stop! The dog. Wait for the dog.

59:23.309 --> 59:26.263
Where'd you learn to fight like that?
- Catholic school. Forget about the dog.

59:26.263 --> 59:29.815
Here, boy. Come on, boy. No, we're waiting
for the dog. Just hold it, hold it.

59:29.983 --> 59:35.197
Okay, hurry. Come on, dog.
Good dog. Good puppy. Go! Go! Let's go!

59:35.822 --> 59:37.007
Stop! Stop!

59:37.007 --> 59:38.991
- What? What?
- Guns.

59:39.158 --> 59:40.284
- It's full of guns.
- Grab one.

59:40.451 --> 59:41.999
- You grab one.
- You got friends?

59:41.999 --> 59:43.787
Go, go! Step on it!

59:47.500 --> 59:49.501
Get that crate. Come on.

59:55.341 --> 59:57.676
Hatchett, you said
not to worry about the police,

59:57.844 --> 59:59.720
but the cops are
all over you, man.

59:59.887 --> 01:00:02.264
They got my guns.
They'll be coming after me next.

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:04.600
So far as I'm concerned,
the deal's off.

01:00:04.767 --> 01:00:07.936
Get a grip on yourself, Tyrone,
all right? We have a deal.

01:00:08.104 --> 01:00:09.521
Nobody backs out.

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:11.690
<i>You said you had the cops
under control.</i>

01:00:11.858 --> 01:00:14.207
Now I see that isn't so.
So you give me one good reason

01:00:14.207 --> 01:00:15.721
<i>why I should do business with you.</i>

01:00:15.721 --> 01:00:19.421
- I'll give you a real good reason.
- Hey, Tyrone, this is Travis.

01:00:19.782 --> 01:00:23.910
You try and back out the deal now, I'll make certain
that only your dentist can identify the body.

01:00:24.078 --> 01:00:26.275
Is that a good enough reason
for you?

01:00:28.791 --> 01:00:30.500
But I need ammo.

01:00:30.668 --> 01:00:32.586
I'm out of business
without ammo.

01:00:32.754 --> 01:00:36.840
I need the good stuff.
- You'll get the ammo. The good stuff.

01:00:38.051 --> 01:00:39.760
"The good stuff." Jesus!

01:00:39.927 --> 01:00:42.054
Time to pay another visit
to the L.A.P.D.

01:00:44.223 --> 01:00:45.932
You look like I feel.

01:00:56.235 --> 01:00:59.279
Hey. Hey.

01:00:59.447 --> 01:01:01.657
You got anything
I can put on my head?

01:01:01.824 --> 01:01:03.200
There's a hat in the closet.

01:01:03.368 --> 01:01:07.954
Oh, you're all heart. And now here I thought
you were gonna get all tender and maternal with me.

01:01:08.122 --> 01:01:10.540
Listen, Riggs,
I was raised with four brothers.

01:01:10.708 --> 01:01:11.958
We got hurt all the time,

01:01:12.126 --> 01:01:15.379
but if no bones were broken
or blood wasn't gushing, nobody cared.

01:01:15.546 --> 01:01:17.923
-Hey, look, blood. See? Blood.
- It's not gushing.

01:01:18.091 --> 01:01:20.759
Well, it was free-flowing earlier.

01:01:21.135 --> 01:01:23.095
Hey, could you at least
bring me a needle and thread?

01:01:23.262 --> 01:01:26.265
You know, maybe some peroxide.
I can patch it up myself.

01:01:28.768 --> 01:01:31.687
- Don't touch anything.
- I... wasn't. I didn't...

01:01:33.439 --> 01:01:35.148
What's with you, anyway?

01:01:50.456 --> 01:01:53.500
The boys.
- Hey, what are you doing, huh?

01:01:53.668 --> 01:01:56.294
I told you not to touch anything.
- Uh, this came on by itself.

01:01:56.462 --> 01:01:57.829
- Oh, it came on all by itself?
- I swear.

01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:58.532
You a wise guy?

01:01:58.532 --> 01:02:00.946
Come on. You don't like anybody
to share your toys, do you?

01:02:00.967 --> 01:02:02.718
- This isn't a toy, Riggs.
- It's not? What is it?

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:04.001
- This is a weapon.
- That's a weapon?

01:02:04.001 --> 01:02:07.308
Yeah. And used properly,
a very effective weapon.

01:02:07.343 --> 01:02:09.266
What, do you throw it at people?
Pretty heavy.

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:12.144
You're gonna give yourself a hernia,
Riggs. Come here and sit down.

01:02:12.311 --> 01:02:13.311
Right here.

01:02:13.479 --> 01:02:15.647
- Okay, take a little off the top.
- Right here.

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:24.156
- What's that? You bring all your interrogations home?
- Okay.

01:02:24.323 --> 01:02:26.783
What are we talking about here?
- Well, it's back here.

01:02:26.951 --> 01:02:28.326
Careful. Careful.

01:02:28.494 --> 01:02:29.995
Careful. Oh.
- This?

01:02:30.163 --> 01:02:32.664
This scratch?
- Come on, it feels like Grand Canyon.

01:02:32.832 --> 01:02:34.624
- Oh, God.
- Ah!

01:02:34.792 --> 01:02:36.251
- Hold still.
- Yeah.

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:40.380
Ah!
- Oh, God. We haven't even started.

01:02:40.548 --> 01:02:42.286
Be gentle with me, will you?

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:45.177
I see this isn't virgin territory.
Hey, what is this? A knife?

01:02:45.344 --> 01:02:49.222
Huh? Oh, that's an axe.
Some guy mistook my head for a log.

01:02:49.474 --> 01:02:51.930
- Ah, that's a natural mistake.
- What are you sayin', that I have a wooden head?

01:02:51.930 --> 01:02:52.253
Yeah.

01:02:52.253 --> 01:02:53.477
- Look at that.
- It's a knife.

01:02:53.644 --> 01:02:55.771
-Knife? That's very knife.
-Mm-hmm.

01:02:56.063 --> 01:02:57.105
Oh, hey, this is all right.

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:58.958
Oh, that's a pavement,
dragged down Crenshaw.

01:02:58.958 --> 01:02:59.839
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

01:02:59.839 --> 01:03:02.861
Hey, that's great. Look at that texture.
Look at this, huh?

01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:05.030
Same damn thing.
Third and Highland.

01:03:05.198 --> 01:03:08.116
Dragged for about half a block, I'll tell you what.
- That's a good one.

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:10.452
Feel that texture. Feel it.
Cheese-grater time.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.704
Moving truck.
- Moving truck? Ooh!

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:14.085
Moving bullet.
- Moving bullet?

01:03:14.085 --> 01:03:16.208
- Yeah. Here. Right here. This is the best.
- Bullets now.

01:03:16.762 --> 01:03:17.636
Oh, hey.

01:03:17.636 --> 01:03:19.795
- Yeah. And it goes all the way through to the back.
- Right through?

01:03:19.962 --> 01:03:21.546
You're lucky. What is it, .22?

01:03:21.714 --> 01:03:23.215
- It's a .38, Riggs.
- That's a .38?

01:03:23.382 --> 01:03:23.989
It's a .38.

01:03:23.989 --> 01:03:26.424
That's a .38? That's kinda wimpy .38.
Now, this is a .38.

01:03:26.459 --> 01:03:28.010
- Yours is bigger than mine?
- I think so.

01:03:28.010 --> 01:03:30.722
- I don't think so.
- Maybe not, but look. Watch.

01:03:30.890 --> 01:03:34.059
A whole family of .44s
on the back. Yeah.

01:03:34.227 --> 01:03:36.311
Look, there they are.
- That's impressive.

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:39.856
One coming through, got one stuck in my lung.
I was breathing blood bubbles. It was disgusting.

01:03:40.024 --> 01:03:41.079
- Blood bubbles.
- Yeah.

01:03:41.079 --> 01:03:41.543
Okay.

01:03:41.543 --> 01:03:42.865
- You got one?
- Mm.

01:03:43.528 --> 01:03:45.153
Pump-action. 12-gauge.

01:03:45.446 --> 01:03:46.905
- Oh, yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

01:03:47.448 --> 01:03:49.332
Yeah. Right down here.
- Oh.

01:03:49.332 --> 01:03:50.280
Went through.

01:03:50.326 --> 01:03:51.535
- Oh, that must've hurt.
- Right.

01:03:51.702 --> 01:03:52.744
- Not too close.
- Pfft!

01:03:52.912 --> 01:03:54.830
Riggs, if he were that close,
I'd be dead.

01:03:54.997 --> 01:03:57.749
I can beat it. I can beat it.
Have a look at this.

01:03:57.917 --> 01:04:00.168
- I'll take your word for it.
- No, no, really. You gotta see this.

01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:01.009
I'll take your word.

01:04:01.009 --> 01:04:02.707
This guy had a two-foot knife.
Oh, you're gonna love it.

01:04:02.707 --> 01:04:03.012
I'm sure.

01:04:03.012 --> 01:04:05.882
You're gonna love it. He stuck it right
in my leg and ran it around  about eight times.

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:08.447
- Clearly hurt like a son of a bitch.
- I'll take your word for it, Riggs.

01:04:08.447 --> 01:04:10.359
- Well, look,
- No, I said forget it.

01:04:10.359 --> 01:04:13.306
- Come on, this is a blue-ribbon event, here, babe.
- Forget it, Riggs.

01:04:14.392 --> 01:04:15.433
Hey, you started this.

01:04:15.601 --> 01:04:18.270
- Yeah, well, I can end it.
- You know what?

01:04:18.729 --> 01:04:20.105
You're a very poor loser.

01:04:21.566 --> 01:04:22.774
I didn't lose, Riggs.

01:04:22.942 --> 01:04:24.693
- Yes, you did.
- No. No, I didn't lose.

01:04:24.861 --> 01:04:25.815
- Yes.
- I conceded.

01:04:25.815 --> 01:04:27.469
- You lost.
- No, I conceded. No, I conceded.

01:04:27.504 --> 01:04:29.030
There's a difference between
losing and conceding.

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:30.866
You conceded
or you're conceited?

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:33.118
- You think I'm conceited?
- Oh, yeah.

01:04:33.286 --> 01:04:35.453
Tell me you lost.
Admit to it.

01:04:35.621 --> 01:04:36.663
I'll go get you a Band-Aid.

01:04:36.831 --> 01:04:39.058
- Come on, tell me you lost.
- I said, don't touch anything.

01:04:51.679 --> 01:04:54.004
You're gonna smack
the shit out of me, right?

01:04:55.099 --> 01:04:57.017
I can do
better than that, Riggs.

01:05:14.486 --> 01:05:17.150
Now, this could be
a serious ethical breach here.

01:05:17.788 --> 01:05:19.956
I never made it
with another sergeant before.

01:05:20.124 --> 01:05:21.791
Shut up, Riggs.

01:06:16.722 --> 01:06:18.223
Oh!

01:06:20.101 --> 01:06:22.727
Oh, damn, Riggs.

01:06:24.522 --> 01:06:27.941
What do you want, Riggs?
- I just wanted to see how you were doing, Cochise.

01:06:28.109 --> 01:06:29.484
Who sent you? Trish?

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:32.278
Well, uh, you're doing pretty well.
No, Trish didn't send me.

01:06:32.446 --> 01:06:34.990
It was Rianne came to see me.
She asked me to find you.

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:37.742
- Your place?
- Well, yeah, that's where I am.

01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:42.080
- My daughter came to your trailer?
- Yeah.

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:44.708
- My daughter came to your trailer?
- What the hell?

01:06:44.875 --> 01:06:46.501
Oh, come on, Roger,
she was worried.

01:06:46.669 --> 01:06:48.586
Hey, hey,
get off of my boat, Riggs.

01:06:48.754 --> 01:06:50.588
- Oh, come on.
- Get off my boat.

01:06:50.756 --> 01:06:52.090
Look, you're drunk, Rog, all right?

01:06:52.281 --> 01:06:54.426
Oh, that's something
you should know about, huh?

01:06:54.593 --> 01:06:56.678
- This isn't gonna do any good.
- Give me that.

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:58.263
- No.
- Give me that.

01:06:58.431 --> 01:07:00.265
Rog, please don't do this, okay?

01:07:00.754 --> 01:07:03.768
Come on, you got three days to go till you retire.
This is not gonna do you any good.

01:07:03.936 --> 01:07:06.312
- You self-righteous bastard. Give it.
- Roger!

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:10.191
- Look, don't do this, okay? Please.
- Hey, give it to me, damn it, Riggs!

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:13.903
No! Oh, Jesus Christ.
What are you gonna do now, shoot me?

01:07:14.071 --> 01:07:15.697
- Uh-huh.
- There.

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:18.450
Take your finger out of my bottle
and give me that gun.

01:07:18.617 --> 01:07:19.784
The bottle's going south.

01:07:21.328 --> 01:07:22.912
Son of a bitch.

01:07:24.790 --> 01:07:26.135
Oh, shit.

01:07:27.585 --> 01:07:30.253
- Not bad for an old man.
- You finished?

01:07:30.421 --> 01:07:32.839
No, I got another bottle in the galley
and I'm gonna get it.

01:07:33.007 --> 01:07:36.866
No, you're not. Rog, don't do this
to yourself, all right? Please.

01:07:36.901 --> 01:07:38.400
You gotta cut this out.

01:07:39.597 --> 01:07:41.973
Oh, man, I'm sorry.
Are you okay? Are you okay?

01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:44.517
All right. Sit down. Sit down.
You okay?

01:07:45.228 --> 01:07:47.645
- You hit me. You hit me.
- Look, cool it, will you?

01:07:47.813 --> 01:07:49.564
Cut it out.
Now, just give it up, okay?

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:50.815
Go ahead.

01:07:50.983 --> 01:07:52.984
Go ahead. Hit me again.

01:07:53.152 --> 01:07:55.487
I don't wanna hit you.
You think I like this shit?

01:07:55.654 --> 01:07:58.406
Hit me again, huh?
You think I'm afraid of you?

01:07:58.574 --> 01:08:00.274
- I know you're not.
- And that-that kung fu shit you...?

01:08:00.274 --> 01:08:02.635
Rog, no! Please, Rog.

01:08:03.537 --> 01:08:05.538
Look, that kid was a killer,
all right?

01:08:05.706 --> 01:08:07.123
That wasn't a tanker toy
in his hand.

01:08:07.291 --> 01:08:10.742
That was a machine pistol
with twin carbines and all the trimmings, man.

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:14.297
He would have drilled you, me,
anybody that came along, all right?

01:08:14.465 --> 01:08:16.006
You had no choice.

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:18.593
It didn't happen to you, Riggs.
It happened to me.

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:20.136
It happened to me!

01:08:20.304 --> 01:08:22.263
My God, I killed that kid.

01:08:22.430 --> 01:08:23.973
I... killed that boy.

01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:26.017
Oh, yeah.
Oh, you kill a lot of people.

01:08:26.185 --> 01:08:29.854
You kill a fucking lot of people!
You ever kill a baby?

01:08:30.022 --> 01:08:33.191
You got ice... ice in your veins.
You ever kill a... a boy like Nick?

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:36.694
You selfish bastard!
You selfish bastard!

01:08:36.862 --> 01:08:39.154
You're just thinking about yourself!
Goddamn it.

01:08:39.323 --> 01:08:41.157
What about me. Huh?

01:08:41.325 --> 01:08:44.558
We're partners. We are partners.

01:08:44.662 --> 01:08:46.287
What happens to you,
happens to me.

01:08:46.455 --> 01:08:49.541
After all the shit we've been through,
don't you get it?

01:08:49.834 --> 01:08:51.167
Don't you get it?

01:08:52.086 --> 01:08:55.337
When you retire, you're not just
retiring you, you're retiring us.

01:08:55.506 --> 01:08:57.756
You're retiring us.
- That's not my problem.

01:08:57.925 --> 01:08:59.551
- Yes, it is.
- It's not my problem.

01:08:59.718 --> 01:09:01.553
You're the only family I got.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.389
I got three beautiful kids.
I love them, they're yours.

01:09:04.557 --> 01:09:07.809
Trish does my laundry.
I live in your icebox. I live in your life.

01:09:07.977 --> 01:09:10.060
What am I gonna do?
What am I... what am I supposed to do?

01:09:10.229 --> 01:09:11.895
- I don't care.
- Yes, you do.

01:09:11.895 --> 01:09:13.305
- I don' care.
- Yes, you do!

01:09:13.305 --> 01:09:15.733
- I don't care! I don't care!
-Yes, you do!

01:09:15.901 --> 01:09:17.902
- I don't care!
- You do so care!

01:09:18.069 --> 01:09:19.487
I don't care!

01:09:19.654 --> 01:09:22.740
I don't care. I don't care.

01:09:24.618 --> 01:09:29.281
I don't know what... I don't know what
I'm saying anymore. I don't know what I'm thinking.

01:09:29.497 --> 01:09:32.584
I had, uh, three days, and now this.

01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:34.752
I'm sorry.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.087
- That's all right.
- No, no, I'm sorry. I-I-I know...

01:09:38.756 --> 01:09:40.175
I didn't realize...

01:09:40.341 --> 01:09:42.426
that my retirement's
gonna screw you up.

01:09:42.595 --> 01:09:46.179
Forget it, man. I haven't got any problems.
I was out of line saying that shit.

01:09:47.057 --> 01:09:48.349
Look, man....

01:09:49.055 --> 01:09:50.977
Um, Riggs, look....

01:09:51.145 --> 01:09:53.604
Hey. You-you-you know I love you.

01:09:54.899 --> 01:10:00.160
You know I love you, Riggs. And-and... and
your problems are my problems, all right?

01:10:00.446 --> 01:10:02.906
I mean, like-like you said,
what happens to you...

01:10:03.574 --> 01:10:05.491
happens to me. So try me.

01:10:05.826 --> 01:10:07.492
I'm here for you.

01:10:07.997 --> 01:10:10.538
I-I haven't...
I haven't got any problems, Rog.

01:10:10.706 --> 01:10:14.459
Oh, yes, you do. We-we...
we all have problems. And-and you help me...

01:10:15.127 --> 01:10:17.055
and-and I'm gonna help you.

01:10:18.631 --> 01:10:21.132
I-I... do have a little problem.

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:22.675
Uh....

01:10:23.177 --> 01:10:25.929
Oh, no, shit. You don't wanna hear.
This is piddly shit.

01:10:26.096 --> 01:10:27.722
Riggs, yes, I do.
I wanna hear it.

01:10:27.890 --> 01:10:30.225
Tell me.
- Now, you know what? This is ridiculous.

01:10:30.392 --> 01:10:32.644
You don't wanna hear it.
- No, no. No. I'm here. I'm here.

01:10:33.395 --> 01:10:34.150
Well....

01:10:35.356 --> 01:10:40.212
I think... maybe I-I slept with someone
that I probably shouldn't have.

01:10:41.278 --> 01:10:42.820
You son of a bitch!

01:10:50.072 --> 01:10:50.870
Help me, man.

01:10:51.038 --> 01:10:52.710
I ought to let you drown,
you traitor.

01:10:52.710 --> 01:10:54.582
Help me, Rog. Help me.

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:56.668
- Come on in.
- Aah!

01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:04.008
- What did you hit me for? You hit me.
- You slept with Rianne.

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:06.832
- I did not.
- Yes, you did.

01:11:06.832 --> 01:11:09.351
Who did you sleep with?
- I slept with sergeant Cole.

01:11:10.224 --> 01:11:11.849
Sergeant Cole from Traffic?

01:11:11.987 --> 01:11:14.102
No, not sergeant Cole
from Traffic.

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:15.311
Lorna.
- Lorna.

01:11:15.479 --> 01:11:17.313
Lorna. Sergeant Cole
from Traffic's her uncle.

01:11:17.481 --> 01:11:20.149
- Oh, okay. That's okay. That's okay.
- Oh, I don't know.

01:11:20.484 --> 01:11:21.693
She was all like...

01:11:22.736 --> 01:11:23.987
Sheriff's Department.

01:11:24.154 --> 01:11:27.031
- Sheriff, we're... we're L.A.P.D.
- L.A.P.D.

01:11:27.199 --> 01:11:29.568
Yeah? What are you boys
doin' down there?

01:11:29.718 --> 01:11:33.162
- Well... we're in the middle of a case.
- Yeah.

01:11:33.330 --> 01:11:34.372
Of Scotch.

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:38.126
Let's get out of here.

01:11:53.559 --> 01:11:56.634
- Go-go... with the grain.
- Huh?

01:11:59.064 --> 01:12:00.690
I'll show you. Here.

01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:05.236
You're going against the grain.

01:12:09.533 --> 01:12:11.868
Like that.
- Okay.

01:12:18.042 --> 01:12:19.167
You okay?

01:12:22.463 --> 01:12:24.881
Darryl was my friend, dad.

01:12:26.258 --> 01:12:28.968
I know. I'm sorry, son.

01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:31.262
I hope you don't blame me.

01:12:33.057 --> 01:12:37.756
I don't blame you, dad.
I blame Darryl.

01:12:41.482 --> 01:12:42.982
- What's this right here?
- Huh?

01:12:43.150 --> 01:12:44.650
- Right there.
- What?

01:12:49.323 --> 01:12:51.199
I love you, dad.

01:12:53.911 --> 01:12:55.953
I love you, son.

01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:05.963
Grant them both pardon
and everlasting rest.

01:13:06.131 --> 01:13:11.177
Let them escape the judgment of vengeance
and enjoy the blessedness of eternal life.

01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:15.807
Oh, Lord, we commend
the soul of Darryl Smithers to your safety.

01:13:16.266 --> 01:13:19.852
May he find the peace in heaven
that eluded him on Earth.

01:13:20.020 --> 01:13:21.979
And may the scourge of violence,

01:13:22.147 --> 01:13:25.525
claiming the lives of our children
be lifted by your grace

01:13:25.692 --> 01:13:27.693
and infinite wisdom.

01:13:28.195 --> 01:13:29.654
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:13:29.988 --> 01:13:31.322
Amen.

01:13:53.345 --> 01:13:55.179
Nice service.

01:13:57.474 --> 01:13:59.155
Wait here.

01:14:04.690 --> 01:14:07.233
Mrs. Smithers. Ma'am?

01:14:10.821 --> 01:14:13.197
I just don't know...

01:14:18.996 --> 01:14:21.164
You wanna do something,
sergeant Murtaugh?

01:14:21.623 --> 01:14:25.418
You find the man
that put the gun in my son's hand.

01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:45.146
Take your mama to the car.

01:14:50.527 --> 01:14:53.184
- You okay?
- Yeah.

01:14:54.239 --> 01:14:55.656
Who's got the gun?

01:14:57.534 --> 01:14:59.577
- We got it.
- Yeah.

01:15:06.502 --> 01:15:08.461
Where did this gun come from,
motherfucker?

01:15:08.629 --> 01:15:10.129
Fuck you.

01:15:11.048 --> 01:15:14.675
Do you ever heard of the word "genocide"?
Like you stupid motherfuckers are?

01:15:14.843 --> 01:15:16.219
You ever heard the word "genocide"?

01:15:16.386 --> 01:15:18.554
You fools are killing yourself!
You're killing us!

01:15:18.722 --> 01:15:20.848
I'm tired of it. I'm tired of it.
Motherfucker.

01:15:21.016 --> 01:15:24.310
You better tell me where this gun's from
or I'll blow your motherfucker head off.

01:15:24.478 --> 01:15:27.779
I wanna know now.
Where did this gun come from?

01:15:33.445 --> 01:15:37.073
Hey, you see this gun? I wanna know where
it came from, Tyrone. I wanna know now.

01:15:38.703 --> 01:15:39.700
Hiya, Hubie.

01:15:39.868 --> 01:15:41.953
Hey, we're looking for
a friend of yours, named Travis.

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:43.120
I never heard of him.

01:15:43.288 --> 01:15:45.873
Never heard... ? Ehh! Ehh!
Wrong answer. Wrong answer. Ehh! Ehh!

01:15:46.041 --> 01:15:49.919
- And you're pulling on the wrong string.
- Hey, Roger, that's not a very professional attitude.

01:15:50.087 --> 01:15:52.338
- Who the fuck are you guys?
- Ah, sorry. L.A.P.D.

01:15:52.506 --> 01:15:56.237
We're just doing a few routine inquiries.
You been checked for lice recently?

01:15:56.593 --> 01:15:58.386
Hey, hey, hey.
Give me my fucking wallet.

01:15:58.554 --> 01:16:01.305
- Hey, keep your hands down.
- Give my fucking wallet back!

01:16:01.473 --> 01:16:03.724
Get up. We don't need this.

01:16:05.185 --> 01:16:08.229
We have a license that belongs
to one Hubert Bartholomew Smith.

01:16:08.397 --> 01:16:09.647
- Is that you?
- Bartholomew.

01:16:09.815 --> 01:16:12.041
- Fuck you.
- Hey, there's a lady here. Do you mind?

01:16:12.041 --> 01:16:13.091
- What the fuck... ?
- Hey!

01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:15.987
What the hell's going on here?

01:16:17.781 --> 01:16:19.740
- Maybe they know something.
- Well, I'll go find out.

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:21.058
- Want me to come with you?
- No, I got it.

01:16:21.058 --> 01:16:22.841
- Sure?
- Mm-hmm. Sure.

01:16:25.038 --> 01:16:27.707
- You know, I should go with her, Riggs.
- I don't know. I want you to see something, Rog.

01:16:27.874 --> 01:16:29.959
She has a gift. Watch this.
- A gift?

01:16:30.127 --> 01:16:33.838
Morning, gentlemen.
L.A.P.D. Got a few questions.

01:16:34.006 --> 01:16:35.006
You on parole?

01:16:35.173 --> 01:16:37.508
- I got a job, fuck-o.
- Shut up. Who asked you?

01:16:38.051 --> 01:16:39.927
Maybe you know a Mr. Travis?

01:16:40.095 --> 01:16:43.180
-You got a warrant?
-No, I don't have a warrant, but I can get one.

01:16:43.315 --> 01:16:45.766
Well, until you do... fuck off.

01:16:45.934 --> 01:16:48.436
Now, that's not a nice thing
to say to a lady.

01:16:48.604 --> 01:16:51.897
- Fuck you.
- I don't think so.

01:16:52.524 --> 01:16:53.899
Ah!

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:57.028
- Backspin kick.
- Sheesh!

01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:03.359
Aah! Shit!

01:17:05.037 --> 01:17:06.871
Hey, watch out.
You okay, honey?

01:17:07.256 --> 01:17:08.539
I'm just great.

01:17:15.172 --> 01:17:16.964
- Honey?
- How are you doing?

01:17:17.132 --> 01:17:18.549
Oh, this guy's on parole.

01:17:18.884 --> 01:17:20.843
And this guy's an asshole.

01:17:21.011 --> 01:17:23.518
- Hey, Riggs, there's five of them, man.
- Yeah, I know.

01:17:25.641 --> 01:17:27.190
Look at the front kick.
Look at that.

01:17:35.233 --> 01:17:36.410
Grabbed his cluster.

01:17:39.071 --> 01:17:39.951
Let me help her.

01:17:40.781 --> 01:17:41.822
Stay still.

01:17:50.957 --> 01:17:52.917
Whoa! Hey, hey, hey.

01:17:55.045 --> 01:17:56.107
My girl.

01:17:57.205 --> 01:18:00.591
Yeah. This PMS... it's murder.

01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:05.996
Ah, yeah, yeah, I know what you mean.
I've been married 25 years.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.375
So tell me about Travis.

01:18:08.725 --> 01:18:11.477
Like I told you before, moron,
I don't know no Jack Travis.

01:18:11.645 --> 01:18:13.270
I didn't say his name was Jack.

01:18:13.438 --> 01:18:16.349
Hey, you better start telling me
more than jack shit. Come on.

01:18:17.651 --> 01:18:18.942
Hey, Murphy.

01:18:19.277 --> 01:18:21.338
People here cross the street
when they see me coming.

01:18:21.338 --> 01:18:22.902
Well, I didn't have enough time.

01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:26.325
I'm not your enemy, captain.
I'm just trying to do my job.

01:18:26.827 --> 01:18:29.787
- Have you eaten?
- Yeah, I already ate. I gotta go downtown.

01:18:29.955 --> 01:18:32.039
- What, do you eat alone?
- I'm used to it.

01:18:32.207 --> 01:18:33.457
It's bad for the digestion.

01:18:33.625 --> 01:18:36.002
Tomorrow you have lunch with me,
but I'm not paying.

01:18:41.466 --> 01:18:43.221
The fuck is this?

01:18:43.468 --> 01:18:44.896
Hey, buddy, you all right?

01:18:45.762 --> 01:18:47.892
Two fingers, Murph.

01:18:48.765 --> 01:18:52.351
- Jack, what the fuck?
- Get in the car. I'll tell you after the ride.

01:18:58.614 --> 01:19:01.610
You know, after watching Lorna
handle herself so well,

01:19:01.778 --> 01:19:04.196
boy, I'm changing my mind
about all that kung fu shit.

01:19:04.364 --> 01:19:05.948
Hey, you wanna try something?

01:19:06.324 --> 01:19:07.478
- Heh, no.
- Come on.

01:19:07.478 --> 01:19:08.268
No, no, no.

01:19:08.303 --> 01:19:10.021
I guess you can't teach
an old dog new tricks.

01:19:10.021 --> 01:19:12.955
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Old dog, my ass, huh?
- Yeah?

01:19:13.123 --> 01:19:17.001
You wanna try something? Okay, watch this.
This is called a backspin kick.

01:19:17.169 --> 01:19:18.836
Pivot on the right,
kick with your left

01:19:19.004 --> 01:19:22.131
and you whip that head around
to catch the target... the target over there.

01:19:22.299 --> 01:19:24.175
Like this, but get that head round first
and follow through.

01:19:24.342 --> 01:19:27.344
Like so.
So you whip the head.

01:19:28.805 --> 01:19:30.055
All right?

01:19:30.515 --> 01:19:33.556
Thank you. Thank you.
Now you try it.

01:19:33.643 --> 01:19:35.770
Here's your target. All right?
- Okay.

01:19:35.937 --> 01:19:39.815
Remember. Pivot on the right, kick with the left,
get that head round and spot that target.

01:19:39.983 --> 01:19:42.526
- Like that.
- Yeah, that's it. Follow the head round.

01:19:42.694 --> 01:19:45.279
Uh, back up a little bit.
We don't want you to bump into this pole.

01:19:45.447 --> 01:19:48.115
Just back up a little bit.
A little bit more. Okay, good.

01:19:48.283 --> 01:19:50.367
Okay, mind and body strong now,
grasshopper.

01:19:50.535 --> 01:19:51.619
All right. Okay.

01:19:52.412 --> 01:19:53.913
Go.

01:19:59.628 --> 01:20:02.713
- Hey, hey, hey!
- He can't hold his water, boys.

01:20:02.881 --> 01:20:04.006
Get back to work.

01:20:04.174 --> 01:20:05.925
Okay, okay,
back to work, everybody.

01:20:06.092 --> 01:20:09.386
Man. Oh, Rog, man, I'm sorry.

01:20:10.889 --> 01:20:12.681
Sergeant Murtaugh.

01:20:12.849 --> 01:20:17.853
You could be experiencing some
transitional anger here caused by the shooting.

01:20:18.021 --> 01:20:20.269
You wanna talk about it?

01:20:20.941 --> 01:20:23.359
- I think he's okay for a change, doc.
- Are you sure?

01:20:23.527 --> 01:20:27.154
Yeah. You know, you really look good
in red. That's your color, I think.

01:20:27.531 --> 01:20:31.367
- I've got a little extra time now, sergeant.
- I'm fine, doctor.

01:20:36.414 --> 01:20:37.414
Oh, shit.

01:20:37.874 --> 01:20:39.708
Where's sergeant Murtaugh?

01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:42.545
- What?
- No, her.

01:20:42.879 --> 01:20:46.048
Can you tell me where I can find
the good-looking sergeant Murtaugh?

01:20:46.466 --> 01:20:48.551
- Aah!
- Hi, skinny!

01:20:48.718 --> 01:20:50.928
Delores. You remember me?
- I remember you.

01:20:51.096 --> 01:20:54.265
Listen. Can you tell me where I can find
the lovely sergeant Murtaugh?

01:20:54.432 --> 01:20:58.269
As a matter of fact, Delores, he's cowering down
on all fours right behind this counter.

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:04.024
- Listen, where's the sergeant? I wanna see 'im.
- Oh, he's not here at the moment, Delores.

01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:06.610
But, uh, hey, you know, he's talked
of nothing but you all week.

01:21:06.778 --> 01:21:08.612
- Shut my mouth.
- Hey, the man's on fire.

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:10.823
- What's the matter, baby?
- A little sciatica.

01:21:10.991 --> 01:21:14.201
Oh. You tell him
Delores was here.

01:21:14.369 --> 01:21:16.245
You tell that man

01:21:16.413 --> 01:21:18.455
that he's the jam
in my jelly roll.

01:21:19.833 --> 01:21:23.210
I'll see you, baby, okay? Bye-bye.
- Okay. Bye.

01:21:25.463 --> 01:21:28.340
Delores says that you're
the jam in her jelly roll. That's a lot...

01:21:28.508 --> 01:21:29.765
I heard.

01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:32.428
- That's a lot of woman there.
- Ah, shit.

01:21:32.596 --> 01:21:36.307
She calls me all the time. And she leaves
me notes. What am I gonna do, Riggs?

01:21:36.474 --> 01:21:38.176
Well, you shouldn't have
led her on in the first place.

01:21:38.176 --> 01:21:40.095
Led her on?
I didn't do anything, Riggs.

01:21:40.145 --> 01:21:44.148
You know, I mean, if Trish finds out
about it... I didn't... I didn't...

01:21:44.482 --> 01:21:47.151
Sergeant, we have got to talk.

01:21:47.319 --> 01:21:49.945
You've gotta come see me.

01:21:50.113 --> 01:21:52.829
- Well, we gotta work. Come on. Let's go.
- Yeah.

01:21:52.829 --> 01:21:55.451
- Thanks anyway for your concern, doc.
- Yeah. Thanks, doc. Here.

01:21:55.702 --> 01:21:56.952
You're a beauty.
- Coming?

01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:58.996
A beauty. Yeah, I'm coming.

01:22:06.588 --> 01:22:08.131
Afternoon, captain.

01:22:10.175 --> 01:22:13.302
That's good, Murphy.
See how easy that was?

01:22:17.307 --> 01:22:19.058
I love it down here,
don't you, Murph?

01:22:19.225 --> 01:22:23.479
This place is better than the swap meet.
Best bargains in town.

01:22:27.192 --> 01:22:28.959
Give me the lock-up keys.

01:22:29.569 --> 01:22:32.363
These guys from the garage,
they're all ex-cons.

01:22:32.530 --> 01:22:34.531
And all busted by
the same police officer,

01:22:34.699 --> 01:22:36.784
lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.

01:22:36.952 --> 01:22:38.702
Early paroles
on the work furlough program.

01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:42.373
Uh-huh. Employed by a company called
Mesa Verde Construction.

01:22:42.831 --> 01:22:44.378
Just a minute, please.
You can't go in there.

01:22:44.378 --> 01:22:45.277
- What?
- You don't have a pass.

01:22:45.277 --> 01:22:46.543
- What?
- May I see your pass?

01:22:46.543 --> 01:22:47.731
- You wanna see my pass?
- Yes, I do.

01:22:47.731 --> 01:22:48.841
Here's my fucking pass.

01:22:48.876 --> 01:22:51.423
I got shot in the line of duty, okay?
- O-o-okay, sergeant Wells. He's with us.

01:22:51.591 --> 01:22:53.133
- He's with us?
- Did I say that?

01:22:53.301 --> 01:22:56.553
- Where'd you get her from? God!
- Leo, what are you doing out of the hospital?

01:22:56.721 --> 01:22:59.099
Don't mention the hospital, okay?
I told you not to leave me there.

01:22:59.099 --> 01:23:01.664
They tried to take my appendix out.
And they gave me a lapotomy.

01:23:01.664 --> 01:23:04.103
- Lapo... Brain surgery? Come on.
- No, a lapotomy.

01:23:04.270 --> 01:23:06.563
Not a lobotomy. Why don't you
cut your hair, Riggs, so you can hear, okay?

01:23:06.731 --> 01:23:07.773
What's the difference?

01:23:07.941 --> 01:23:10.643
You don't know the difference?
The difference is, when you get a lapotomy,

01:23:10.643 --> 01:23:12.373
they-they shave
your ne... your nether regions.

01:23:12.373 --> 01:23:15.364
- Nether what?
-Your nether... I can't say it in front of her.

01:23:15.532 --> 01:23:16.991
Well, point to it.

01:23:17.914 --> 01:23:19.743
- Okay. Here. Okay?
- Must be pretty itchy.

01:23:19.911 --> 01:23:22.329
Yes, it is itchy.
These doctors are savages.

01:23:22.497 --> 01:23:27.123
I mean, where does it say that a gunshot
wound requires a rectal exam? Huh? Huh?

01:23:28.628 --> 01:23:31.088
Yeah. With a... with a telescope
big enough to see Venus.

01:23:31.256 --> 01:23:32.923
I guess all they saw
was Uranus, huh?

01:23:33.091 --> 01:23:35.259
Oh, that's great. Huh-huh.
That's great. Thank you.

01:23:35.427 --> 01:23:36.844
Well, you know what I say?
- What?

01:23:37.012 --> 01:23:40.764
They fuck you in the hospital!
First they drug you, then they fuck you.

01:23:40.932 --> 01:23:42.141
And when they're done
fuckin' you,

01:23:42.308 --> 01:23:45.394
along comes the insurance company,
and fucks you some more.

01:23:45.562 --> 01:23:48.605
Ten dollars for a fuckin' aspirin,
that's not even covered.

01:23:48.773 --> 01:23:50.065
- Leo!
- That's enough.

01:23:50.233 --> 01:23:51.775
- We're trying to work here.
- Okay, okay, okay.

01:23:51.943 --> 01:23:54.778
So, what's new on our case?
Anything new? You got Travis yet?

01:23:54.946 --> 01:23:56.530
What did you guys do,
take an ad out in the paper?

01:23:56.698 --> 01:23:59.283
- Uh, he's family. We gotta go somewhere else.
- Who's she?

01:23:59.451 --> 01:24:01.577
- Sergeant Cole.
- Hey, how are you? Leo Getz.

01:24:01.745 --> 01:24:03.454
Anything you need, Leo Getz. Get it?

01:24:03.621 --> 01:24:05.581
- I get it.
- Real estate right now, but....

01:24:05.749 --> 01:24:08.310
Hey, hey, listen. Come on, you guys,
give me a break, will you?

01:24:08.310 --> 01:24:10.419
I owe this guy one. I owe this guy one.
Give me something to do.

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:12.171
Let me try...
- You can get us a cup of coffee.

01:24:12.338 --> 01:24:16.246
Well, that's great. Thanks a lot, Riggs. I take one
for you, and that's what you tell me? Huh?

01:24:16.246 --> 01:24:17.247
- He could check this out.
- That's all I'm good for?

01:24:17.247 --> 01:24:18.746
Takes slugs to put me out of shit...

01:24:18.746 --> 01:24:21.930
Leo, Leo, Leo. Look. Look.
We got something for you to do.

01:24:22.098 --> 01:24:25.751
Check out Mesa Verde Construction.
Find out all the information you can. Okay?

01:24:25.751 --> 01:24:28.479
- Okay. Okay. Sure, I can do this.
- You remember that name?

01:24:28.646 --> 01:24:30.481
Right around...
Mesa Verde, I got it.

01:24:30.648 --> 01:24:32.983
Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing
giving him Mesa Verde Construction?

01:24:33.151 --> 01:24:34.985
If there's any shit there,
he'll dig it up, I promise.

01:24:35.153 --> 01:24:37.029
- Who the hell is that guy?
- It's a long story.

01:24:43.328 --> 01:24:44.745
Here are your keys, captain.

01:24:46.164 --> 01:24:47.873
- You motherfucker.
- Don't be stupid, Murphy.

01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:50.626
- The fuck?
- Take the elevator down, bring the other guys.

01:24:50.794 --> 01:24:52.586
Keys. Give me your fucking hands.

01:24:53.588 --> 01:24:57.132
Goddamn you, Travis. Fuck.

01:24:57.801 --> 01:24:59.885
Stand there.

01:25:03.306 --> 01:25:05.808
I can get faster results
than that real-estate broker.

01:25:05.975 --> 01:25:08.727
Oh. Leo's not
just a real-estate broker.

01:25:08.895 --> 01:25:11.772
Yeah, he's a royal pain in the ass
with a lot of connections.

01:25:12.816 --> 01:25:16.401
That's what we came for.
Load everything on the elevator, guys.

01:25:16.569 --> 01:25:18.904
- How'd you know where to find them?
- We got it all, Jack.

01:25:19.072 --> 01:25:21.198
World of computers, Murph.
World of computers.

01:25:21.366 --> 01:25:24.034
You used to be one of us,
for chrissakes, Jack.

01:25:24.202 --> 01:25:27.287
You know what future
a cop has, Murph? None.

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:30.541
Punch a clock for 30 years.
Retirement.

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:32.084
Pension.

01:25:32.585 --> 01:25:33.627
Nothing to do.

01:25:33.795 --> 01:25:37.214
Drunk at noon, bullet in the brain
by evening. Well, not for this kid.

01:25:37.382 --> 01:25:39.508
Police department's got it all:

01:25:39.676 --> 01:25:43.385
guns, ammo, drugs, cash.
It's a one-stop shopping center.

01:25:43.385 --> 01:25:46.390
If you got the balls, the brains, there's
not a thing anybody can do about it.

01:25:46.558 --> 01:25:49.226
You're already fucking history,
Jack, and you know it.

01:25:49.394 --> 01:25:51.728
Sorry, Murph.
But I'm just getting started.

01:25:52.230 --> 01:25:54.231
- Yeah, something's wrong here.
- What?

01:25:54.399 --> 01:25:56.859
The program's been accessed
by somebody from the outside.

01:25:57.026 --> 01:25:58.527
What? What's been accessed?

01:25:58.695 --> 01:26:02.281
After the guns were stolen, Internal Affairs
moved all the confiscated ammunition.

01:26:02.448 --> 01:26:04.658
- Armor-piercing bullets?
- Yeah, thousands of rounds,

01:26:04.826 --> 01:26:07.411
to a more secured location. Shit.

01:26:07.579 --> 01:26:09.454
-That's the information that's been accessed.
- Somebody else knows about it.

01:26:09.622 --> 01:26:11.832
Yeah, where's it stored?
Where did they move it?

01:26:13.168 --> 01:26:14.668
- Wait, wait.
- Let's go.

01:26:14.836 --> 01:26:18.297
I guess I'm not cut out for Internal Affairs.
- Where is it?

01:26:18.464 --> 01:26:19.756
- Right here in the building.
- Where?

01:26:19.924 --> 01:26:21.675
- I'm showing you.
- Something going down?

01:26:21.843 --> 01:26:23.802
- No, no, there's nothing going down.
- I knew it. I'm going with you.

01:26:23.970 --> 01:26:25.762
- No, uh, how old are you?
- Twenty-two today.

01:26:25.930 --> 01:26:29.266
Twenty-two? Come on.
You got protection?

01:26:29.434 --> 01:26:32.241
- Right here in my wallet.
- Your wallet? No, get your vest, you dummy.

01:26:32.241 --> 01:26:33.437
- All right, yeah.
- Should we take him, Rog?

01:26:33.605 --> 01:26:36.148
Okay, but keep your head down.
If anything rash happens, keep your head down.

01:26:36.316 --> 01:26:37.733
- Stay behind me.
- Come on, let's go.

01:26:37.901 --> 01:26:39.109
- Yoo-hoo!
- Shh! Quiet.

01:26:51.456 --> 01:26:53.081
See, you were my ticket in, Murph.

01:26:53.666 --> 01:26:56.293
It's too bad
you won't be coming with me.

01:27:00.423 --> 01:27:01.673
Travis.

01:27:01.841 --> 01:27:03.675
- They got it all.
- Shit.

01:27:04.385 --> 01:27:06.345
- He's dead.
- How'd they get it out of here?

01:27:06.512 --> 01:27:08.972
- I don't know.
- They didn't take it upstairs.

01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:11.099
Hey, hey. Elevator.

01:27:13.686 --> 01:27:16.313
Shit. It's down, it's down.
- Hey, the subway's down there.

01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:17.132
Subways?

01:27:17.167 --> 01:27:18.398
- We take the stairs.
- L.A. has subways?

01:27:18.566 --> 01:27:19.608
Yeah, where you been, kid?

01:27:19.776 --> 01:27:21.652
Read something
besides the funny pages, kid.

01:27:22.695 --> 01:27:25.147
All right, guys.
Come on, let's hustle.

01:27:27.700 --> 01:27:29.394
Hurry up, guys.

01:27:42.173 --> 01:27:43.590
L.A.P.D., guys. Come here.

01:27:43.758 --> 01:27:45.634
Come here. Step on it.

01:27:46.261 --> 01:27:47.928
Son of a bitch.

01:27:48.096 --> 01:27:49.888
Did you see anybody who shouldn't be
down here, anything strange?

01:27:50.056 --> 01:27:51.323
Lots of cops and
a bunch of boxes.

01:27:51.323 --> 01:27:54.387
Cops and boxes. Split. Split now.
Split. Just get out of here.

01:27:55.019 --> 01:27:56.687
Hey, I'm going acros, right?.
- I got it.

01:28:03.778 --> 01:28:05.570
Get rid of Murphy, now!

01:28:11.286 --> 01:28:13.370
Where the fuck do you think
you're going? Let's go.

01:28:25.758 --> 01:28:27.134
Split. Get out of here.

01:28:28.928 --> 01:28:29.968
Cover me.

01:28:36.311 --> 01:28:37.449
Riggs!

01:28:50.658 --> 01:28:52.390
Let's go. Let's go!

01:28:56.289 --> 01:28:57.956
Riggs.

01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:03.587
Yeah, son, stay still.

01:29:13.598 --> 01:29:15.724
Happy birthday, kid.

01:29:25.443 --> 01:29:26.610
Oh, shit!

01:29:41.417 --> 01:29:42.793
Another baby.

01:29:55.181 --> 01:29:57.140
Hey! Is he dead?
Check the body.

01:29:57.308 --> 01:29:58.975
Get me the fuck
out of here, will you?

01:30:00.645 --> 01:30:02.437
Hey, Riggs! Hey, Riggs!

01:30:02.730 --> 01:30:05.148
Riggs! Stupid son of a bitch.

01:30:17.078 --> 01:30:19.162
Stop that shit. Cut it out.

01:30:19.330 --> 01:30:21.164
- Hey, hey, hey! Don't shoot.
- L.A.P.D., man.

01:30:21.332 --> 01:30:22.582
Where does this tunnel
come out?

01:30:22.750 --> 01:30:24.126
- Pico Station.
- Thanks, pal.

01:30:24.293 --> 01:30:25.335
Hey, not that way.

01:30:25.503 --> 01:30:28.255
Take the stairs, man, it's faster.
- Okay, thanks.

01:30:39.058 --> 01:30:39.835
Ow!

01:30:39.835 --> 01:30:42.561
Sorry, pal. Where's the tunnel?
Gangway!

01:30:50.528 --> 01:30:52.320
Get out of the way.
Get ouy of the way.

01:30:55.324 --> 01:30:57.868
Holy shit. Son of a bitch.

01:30:58.703 --> 01:30:59.911
Police!

01:31:06.878 --> 01:31:08.962
Step on it!
There he is! Step on it!

01:31:10.590 --> 01:31:12.048
Goddamn.

01:31:16.888 --> 01:31:18.847
Put your foot down!

01:31:24.896 --> 01:31:26.563
I can't!

01:31:45.917 --> 01:31:47.615
- Hey, police!
-What?

01:31:47.615 --> 01:31:49.703
- I need your bike, man.
- Ah, this is bullshit.

01:31:49.703 --> 01:31:53.882
I need your bike. Sergeant Riggs,
call it in. I need a couple clips too.

01:32:09.357 --> 01:32:10.687
Okay, we lost him.

01:32:18.241 --> 01:32:20.367
- Central, where's Riggs?
- Six-William-Six.

01:32:20.535 --> 01:32:22.869
Central, keep me in touch
with motorcycle pursuit.

01:32:30.461 --> 01:32:32.128
- Shit.
- Take a fucking right, now.

01:32:32.296 --> 01:32:33.713
Take a right! Go!

01:32:34.465 --> 01:32:36.327
Go! Go! Go!

01:32:37.301 --> 01:32:39.594
Stupid. Take a right.
No, left! Left!

01:32:51.148 --> 01:32:52.148
Shit!

01:32:57.113 --> 01:32:58.280
Oh, shit!

01:33:14.630 --> 01:33:15.888
Watch it!

01:33:20.428 --> 01:33:22.470
This is 6-William-6,
this is 6-William-6.

01:33:22.638 --> 01:33:24.347
I'm at the freeway construction site.

01:33:24.515 --> 01:33:27.392
Where's Riggs? I'm here. Where's Riggs?
Come back to me, Central.

01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:29.311
<i>Six-William-Six, location west...</i>

01:33:29.478 --> 01:33:31.021
Where's Riggs?
Where the hell is Riggs?

01:33:32.607 --> 01:33:35.150
Take a left here. Get off.
Get off the freeway.

01:33:36.527 --> 01:33:37.777
Oh, Jesus!

01:33:47.538 --> 01:33:48.538
Stop! Stop! Hold it!

01:33:50.374 --> 01:33:51.458
Oh, shit!

01:33:52.335 --> 01:33:53.709
Hang on.

01:33:56.047 --> 01:33:57.213
Stop!

01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:10.018
Where is the pursuit?

01:34:14.315 --> 01:34:15.716
Oh, shit.

01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:32.248
- Riggs! Hey, just relax. Relax, Riggs.
- Relax?

01:34:34.001 --> 01:34:35.210
Riggs! Riggs!

01:34:35.544 --> 01:34:39.696
Oh, shit!!!

01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:45.929
Riggs! Riggs!

01:34:49.558 --> 01:34:52.769
Riggs. Hey, Riggs.

01:34:52.978 --> 01:34:55.105
Get-get back.
Just get back. Get back!

01:34:55.773 --> 01:34:58.108
Riggs, talk to me. Hey, Riggs.

01:34:58.275 --> 01:35:01.027
Riggs, you're alive. Come here.

01:35:01.195 --> 01:35:04.280
Don't move. Don't move.
I said just get back!

01:35:05.116 --> 01:35:06.449
You all right?

01:35:08.786 --> 01:35:10.495
Hey, hey, hey, Riggs, don't...

01:35:10.663 --> 01:35:12.038
Hey, hey, Riggs!

01:35:13.582 --> 01:35:14.749
Don't touch me!

01:35:14.917 --> 01:35:17.794
Okay, okay, okay. I'm not touching you.
I'm not touching you.

01:35:17.962 --> 01:35:20.213
- Just be... just be careful.
- Don't touch me. Don't!

01:35:25.176 --> 01:35:27.053
- Don't touch me, don't touch me.
- Okay, I won't touch you.

01:35:27.221 --> 01:35:28.388
I'm not touching you.

01:35:31.391 --> 01:35:35.645
- Okay. You-you okay now?
- I'm pissed now, Rog. Now I'm pissed.

01:35:35.813 --> 01:35:37.313
- Now what?
- That son of a bitch.

01:35:37.481 --> 01:35:39.399
He's done it twice now. Damn.

01:35:39.567 --> 01:35:42.444
Son of a... I'm gonna suck
his eyes out through his nose.

01:35:42.695 --> 01:35:44.821
Twice he got away.
Nobody gets away from me!

01:35:44.989 --> 01:35:47.824
Okay. Just relax. Just relax.

01:35:48.159 --> 01:35:49.993
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:35:50.161 --> 01:35:52.662
You okay?
- I'm okay. I'm okay. Okay.

01:35:55.374 --> 01:35:56.555
Hey!

01:35:57.251 --> 01:35:58.752
- Hey, I'm having that.
- But I thought you quit!

01:35:58.919 --> 01:36:01.129
I ran out of biscuits, all right?
Give me a break.

01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:04.486
Oh, shit.

01:36:05.896 --> 01:36:06.892
Oh, shit.

01:36:11.348 --> 01:36:12.543
Perfect.

01:36:13.601 --> 01:36:15.769
- What I miss? What I miss?
- What's he doing here?

01:36:15.936 --> 01:36:18.146
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Great car chase.

01:36:18.314 --> 01:36:20.273
Great chase.
- What are you doing here?

01:36:20.441 --> 01:36:22.275
- How'd you find us, huh?
- My police scanner.

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:24.348
What are you doing
with a police scanner?

01:36:24.612 --> 01:36:28.948
What am I... ? Hello, Car 54, where are you?
Hey, I cracked this case for you guys.

01:36:29.116 --> 01:36:31.451
All right? Listen.
Mesa Verde's legit.

01:36:31.619 --> 01:36:33.995
They got a housing project
down the desert called Rancho Arroyo.

01:36:34.163 --> 01:36:36.040
- Yeah, I know where that is.
- Hey, why don't we check it out?

01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:37.302
- Good idea, Roger.
- Yeah.

01:36:37.302 --> 01:36:39.689
Okay, hey, wait, wait. I'll leave my car here
and I'll come with you...

01:36:39.689 --> 01:36:42.420
- No, you're not coming with us.
- Yes, I am. I'll take my car.

01:36:42.588 --> 01:36:44.380
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

01:36:46.133 --> 01:36:49.260
I can't believe you did that.
I got a spare in the trunk.

01:36:52.223 --> 01:36:53.890
- You're driving.
- No, I'm driving.

01:36:54.058 --> 01:36:56.768
How could you do that?
I can't believe you did that.

01:36:56.936 --> 01:36:59.395
I can't believe you did that.
- Hey, where's Lorna?

01:36:59.563 --> 01:37:01.731
- I can't believe you did that.
- With Walters.

01:37:02.399 --> 01:37:05.151
I can't belie....
I can't believe you did that.

01:37:05.319 --> 01:37:07.487
How can you...
how can you do that to me?

01:37:08.572 --> 01:37:10.740
Did you see that?
They're my partners.

01:37:10.908 --> 01:37:13.576
I can't believe they did that.
- Twenty-one and 18, clear.

01:37:13.744 --> 01:37:15.078
Excuse me, you own your home?

01:37:48.946 --> 01:37:51.614
- Looks like we came to the right place.
- Yeah.

01:37:51.782 --> 01:37:53.616
Move on out to Travis Town.

01:37:53.784 --> 01:37:56.006
Great place to raise a family.

01:37:56.537 --> 01:37:58.705
Built on guns and bloodshed.

01:37:58.873 --> 01:38:01.583
here's one hell of a retirement plan
this asshole's got, isn't it?

01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:04.127
Let's foreclose
on this son of a bitch.

01:38:04.712 --> 01:38:07.171
- Say, is that, uh... ?
- It's Darryl's gun.

01:38:07.339 --> 01:38:10.008
I've been saving it for the right occasion.
- This is the right occasion.

01:38:10.175 --> 01:38:11.562
How many men
you think he has?

01:38:11.562 --> 01:38:14.637
Who knows? Maybe I should run over there
and ask him, what do you say?

01:38:14.805 --> 01:38:16.347
- That'd be too easy.
- Yeah.

01:38:16.557 --> 01:38:18.641
Wish I had some grenades
or a nice rocket launcher.

01:38:18.809 --> 01:38:20.602
Maybe a ground-to-air missile.

01:38:20.769 --> 01:38:23.688
Hey, I wonder what
Murphy's got in his trunk.

01:38:25.983 --> 01:38:28.321
Well, it's obvious Murph was never a boy scout.
- Shit.

01:38:28.903 --> 01:38:30.486
- Not even a good spare.
- Yeah.

01:38:32.156 --> 01:38:33.491
Shit.

01:38:34.575 --> 01:38:36.326
Put your hands down.
It's embarrassing.

01:38:39.622 --> 01:38:41.748
How you doing?
- Kissing, huh?

01:38:41.916 --> 01:38:45.251
- Fresh ones, huh?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. Shaving cuts.

01:38:45.419 --> 01:38:46.711
We don't get
any points for those.

01:38:46.879 --> 01:38:48.755
- How did you get here?
- Drove.

01:38:48.923 --> 01:38:51.424
- No, no, no, no, no. How did you... ?
- I ran into Leo at the police station.

01:38:51.592 --> 01:38:53.134
He talked to me first.
- Leo, Leo.

01:38:53.302 --> 01:38:55.345
Any ideas?
- Lucky thing we got a plan.

01:38:55.512 --> 01:38:57.347
- Yeah.
-Yeah, lucky thing. What is it?

01:38:57.514 --> 01:39:02.435
- Oh, no. I want it to be a surprise.
- Oh, I like surprises.

01:39:07.274 --> 01:39:08.641
Move it!

01:39:10.694 --> 01:39:12.949
- Come on, let's check it out.
- Let's go.

01:39:30.172 --> 01:39:32.757
- Son of a bitch. Look what they did to Murph's car.
- Could've been worse.

01:39:32.925 --> 01:39:35.176
Could've been yours.
- Could've been worse, could've been Trish's car.

01:39:37.304 --> 01:39:38.346
- On three.
- Three.

01:39:38.514 --> 01:39:39.555
- Three?
- Yeah, three.

01:39:39.723 --> 01:39:40.848
Okay.

01:39:41.141 --> 01:39:42.308
One...

01:39:43.435 --> 01:39:44.560
-...two....
- Three.

01:39:44.728 --> 01:39:46.562
Police! Freeze!
- Hey!

01:39:47.731 --> 01:39:48.856
Oh, shit!

01:39:59.034 --> 01:40:00.994
- Go! Go! Let's go!
- Yeah, yeah.

01:40:08.711 --> 01:40:11.212
What's wrong with you?
I said go on three, not two.

01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:12.755
Nobody goes on two.
- On three! Three!

01:40:12.923 --> 01:40:15.091
- Three. It's always three.
- Boys! Boys!

01:40:16.343 --> 01:40:18.636
What are we doing here?
Losing our heads in a crisis?

01:40:22.175 --> 01:40:23.766
Hey, cover me. Cover me.

01:40:43.537 --> 01:40:44.579
Exxon.

01:40:46.623 --> 01:40:48.458
- Hey, Rog!
- Murtaugh!

01:40:49.376 --> 01:40:50.668
- What?
- Count to 20.

01:40:51.587 --> 01:40:54.297
- What?
- Count to 20, then light me!

01:40:58.802 --> 01:40:59.996
Shit!

01:41:02.473 --> 01:41:04.265
Riggs, it's loaded with ammo.

01:41:18.197 --> 01:41:19.655
- Cover me.
- Cover you?

01:41:21.408 --> 01:41:23.242
Cover you, cover Riggs.
Cover everybody.

01:41:23.410 --> 01:41:25.995
When's somebody gonna
cover me for a change?

01:41:30.793 --> 01:41:33.252
What's that, 13, 14?
Ah, to hell with it.

01:41:49.686 --> 01:41:52.355
Jack, it's the cops.
They're burning everything.

01:41:55.818 --> 01:41:56.859
God!

01:42:03.909 --> 01:42:06.744
Son of a bitch. Shit.
Crazy motherfucker!

01:42:10.916 --> 01:42:13.876
Damn. Hey, Riggs, the ammo.
Get out of there.

01:42:30.394 --> 01:42:34.355
Riggs, you crazy son of a bitch.
- Yeah! Ha, ha!

01:42:49.872 --> 01:42:51.706
Son of a bitch.
It works. Shit.

01:42:56.253 --> 01:42:59.922
Stay there. That shit works, Riggs.
Riggs!

01:43:13.478 --> 01:43:14.604
Son of a bitch.
No clip.

01:43:17.566 --> 01:43:19.275
Lorna, no, don't!

01:43:25.949 --> 01:43:27.283
Come on in, bitch.

01:43:27.951 --> 01:43:29.417
Door's open.

01:43:53.185 --> 01:43:55.144
I'm gonna eat
your fucking heart!

01:44:22.631 --> 01:44:23.965
Son of a bitch.

01:44:26.551 --> 01:44:27.972
Travis!

01:44:29.388 --> 01:44:30.386
Shit.

01:44:44.486 --> 01:44:47.863
Armor-piercing bullets, yeah.
Cop killers.

01:44:49.199 --> 01:44:50.915
You're coming with me.

01:44:59.376 --> 01:45:00.459
Fuck you, asshole!

01:45:05.799 --> 01:45:06.841
Hey, Riggs.

01:45:13.724 --> 01:45:16.434
Riggs! Hey, Riggs. Riggs!

01:45:18.937 --> 01:45:22.940
Riggs! Get up! Get up, Riggs!
Get up! Get up!

01:45:23.317 --> 01:45:24.900
Killed in the line of duty,
Riggs!

01:45:29.364 --> 01:45:32.241
You'll get a great funeral
from the department, Riggs!

01:45:37.581 --> 01:45:39.915
Hey, Riggs. Cop killers.

01:45:52.054 --> 01:45:53.596
Ex-cop killers.

01:46:04.066 --> 01:46:05.775
Go to hell, Riggs.

01:46:07.110 --> 01:46:08.486
You first.

01:46:17.371 --> 01:46:20.122
Hey, Riggs!
Crazy son of a bitch!

01:46:26.338 --> 01:46:28.790
I'm sorry, honey, I gotta do it.
I gotta look.

01:46:29.007 --> 01:46:31.008
Oh. Oh.

01:46:31.176 --> 01:46:33.135
Just hold still. Hold still.

01:46:33.303 --> 01:46:35.346
Hey, get a chopper, man.
Get a chopper.

01:46:35.639 --> 01:46:37.723
She had two vests on.
She's gonna be okay.

01:46:37.891 --> 01:46:39.771
A couple of bad ones, though.
We need to get a chopper.

01:46:39.771 --> 01:46:44.146
Okay, okay. You're all right, partner.
You're all right. All right. Hang on. Okay.

01:46:44.773 --> 01:46:47.733
It's okay, it's okay.
Just lie still. Just lie still.

01:46:47.901 --> 01:46:51.112
Just a romantic evening
by the fire, just the two of us.

01:46:51.363 --> 01:46:52.571
Just be still.

01:46:56.597 --> 01:46:58.927
- Lock and load!
- I got it.

01:47:02.624 --> 01:47:05.126
Oh, honey, open your eyes.
Open your eyes.

01:47:05.794 --> 01:47:07.336
Open your eyes.

01:47:10.841 --> 01:47:12.842
What are you trying to prove
out there, huh?

01:47:13.218 --> 01:47:14.635
Huh? Why do you do that?

01:47:15.303 --> 01:47:17.054
Can I take this off?
- Yeah.

01:47:19.099 --> 01:47:21.058
You're supposed to grow old
with someone...

01:47:21.226 --> 01:47:22.852
not because of them,
all right?

01:47:28.984 --> 01:47:30.359
I'm gonna be
with you, Lorna.

01:47:31.153 --> 01:47:33.154
Hey, I'm with you now.
Look, I'm right here.

01:47:33.321 --> 01:47:35.364
We're both here, right?
Right.

01:47:37.242 --> 01:47:39.201
Come on,
I wanna be with you.

01:47:39.369 --> 01:47:41.245
What do you got to lose?

01:47:42.164 --> 01:47:43.205
You.

01:47:45.333 --> 01:47:46.667
Not likely.

01:47:52.132 --> 01:47:54.341
Hey, Lorna.
- Yeah?

01:47:56.595 --> 01:47:58.679
Let's live
to regret this, huh?

01:48:02.601 --> 01:48:04.643
Okay, we've gotta go, sarge.
- Okay.

01:48:05.187 --> 01:48:06.593
She's gonna be fine.

01:48:10.609 --> 01:48:12.026
Can you hear me?

01:48:13.528 --> 01:48:14.570
I love you.

01:48:32.172 --> 01:48:36.175
Happy retirement, daddy

01:48:37.093 --> 01:48:40.971
Happy retirement, daddy

01:48:41.431 --> 01:48:43.599
This is it. This is the day.

01:48:44.476 --> 01:48:45.559
Everybody? Daddy?

01:48:45.727 --> 01:48:48.854
I want you to know there's a candle
on the cake for every year in the force.

01:48:49.022 --> 01:48:50.814
- Yes. A lot of years. A lot of years
- That's a lot.

01:48:50.982 --> 01:48:52.983
Come on, you have to blow it out.
- Come on.

01:48:53.151 --> 01:48:55.736
- Blow them out.
- Blow them out. Come on.

01:48:55.904 --> 01:48:57.279
- I can't.
- Come on, we'll help.

01:48:57.447 --> 01:49:01.242
- No, that's not what I mean.
- What?

01:49:01.743 --> 01:49:03.619
I can't retire.

01:49:04.663 --> 01:49:06.830
I thought I could.
I wanted to.

01:49:08.250 --> 01:49:09.792
But I can't.

01:49:13.630 --> 01:49:15.631
So that means you're gonna
stay with the force?

01:49:15.799 --> 01:49:17.967
That means I'm staying
with the force, baby.

01:49:21.346 --> 01:49:24.572
This cake's about to explode,
so, uh, you better blow out these candles.

01:49:25.061 --> 01:49:29.802
But, um, dad, l want you to know
that I'm behind you all the way.

01:49:30.021 --> 01:49:31.897
- Yeah, me too.
- So am I, dad.

01:49:32.065 --> 01:49:34.316
- It's okay.
- Well, the streets will be safer

01:49:34.484 --> 01:49:36.288
for another couple years.

01:49:38.405 --> 01:49:41.115
- Word, Nick.
- Word, dad.

01:49:44.202 --> 01:49:45.744
Blow them out.

01:49:46.788 --> 01:49:47.955
Hello?

01:49:48.123 --> 01:49:50.332
- Hello. Up here!
- Hello?

01:49:50.500 --> 01:49:53.919
-Hello. Hey, I gotta talk to Roger.
- Leo.

01:49:54.087 --> 01:49:55.170
Oprah should see this.

01:49:55.338 --> 01:49:57.840
I can't believe this.
Okay, okay, this is great.

01:49:58.008 --> 01:49:59.466
Leo, what is it?

01:49:59.634 --> 01:50:02.560
Hey, where's Riggs? I didn't know
he could hold his breath that long.

01:50:02.804 --> 01:50:04.847
Okay, okay, okay.
- I'm taking a bath, Leo.

01:50:05.015 --> 01:50:07.975
I can see that. And it's cold water too.
There goes your image.

01:50:08.143 --> 01:50:11.061
- Leo.
- Listen, I got great news, okay?

01:50:11.229 --> 01:50:14.398
Okay? Once again,
Leo Getz has delivered.

01:50:14.566 --> 01:50:16.692
Okay, I have sold this turkey.

01:50:17.569 --> 01:50:21.989
This termite-infested dump
is now gone. Okay?

01:50:22.157 --> 01:50:25.638
All you have to do is sign the contract
before the suckers change their mind. Okay?

01:50:25.702 --> 01:50:26.910
Okay? I did it. I did it.

01:50:27.078 --> 01:50:28.537
- Hey, hey, hey. Leo, Leo.
-What?

01:50:28.705 --> 01:50:30.205
The house is off the market.

01:50:30.373 --> 01:50:34.335
We're gonna stay in this termite-infested
turkey for another 10 years.

01:50:34.502 --> 01:50:36.462
- At least.
- And I'll get married in here.

01:50:36.630 --> 01:50:39.131
- Come on, you guys. Come on, out.
- You can't do this.

01:50:39.299 --> 01:50:41.091
- Out, out, out.
- No, you can't do that.

01:50:41.259 --> 01:50:43.886
- You too, Leo.
- You can't do that.

01:50:44.054 --> 01:50:45.220
I have contracts signed.

01:50:45.388 --> 01:50:47.640
Because we're partners,
no commission. Okay?

01:50:47.807 --> 01:50:48.459
Partners?

01:50:48.459 --> 01:50:51.580
Part... You and Riggs, you owe me
two tires. Two new tires I want.

01:50:51.580 --> 01:50:52.561
- Why?
- Why?

01:50:52.729 --> 01:50:55.681
Because bullets aren't covered
in normal road hazard. That's why.

01:50:55.681 --> 01:50:59.234
And I want those tires! No conditions!
- Oh, God. Leo, get out of here.

01:50:59.402 --> 01:51:01.904
- Don't tell me to get out!
- Get out. Leo, out, out!

01:51:02.072 --> 01:51:04.198
You're lucky your wife's here.
You're lucky...

01:51:04.366 --> 01:51:05.407
- Out!
- Okay.

01:51:08.620 --> 01:51:10.913
Don't come crying to me if the termites...
- Get out!

01:51:11.081 --> 01:51:13.957
- Termites get... Okay, okay.
- No more!

01:51:16.461 --> 01:51:19.254
Your friends.
- Yeah.

01:51:19.714 --> 01:51:22.633
Ten more years
till forced retirement, huh, baby?

01:51:23.802 --> 01:51:27.971
That's, uh, 3650 days.

01:51:28.139 --> 01:51:30.933
- Forty-nine.
- Oh, yeah.

01:51:41.736 --> 01:51:43.821
I'll try and improve my image.
- Mm.

01:51:50.745 --> 01:51:54.623
- See you soon. Thanks a lot.
- Don't mention it.

01:51:54.791 --> 01:51:56.792
Oh, bye, daddy.

01:51:59.129 --> 01:52:00.577
Bye, baby.

01:52:09.806 --> 01:52:11.367
What are you smiling at?

01:52:12.517 --> 01:52:15.686
Why weren't you at my party, huh?
- I knew you weren't gonna retire.

01:52:15.854 --> 01:52:19.606
I've been wrong about a couple o' things
in my life, but I knew you weren't gonna retire.

01:52:19.774 --> 01:52:21.942
Well, I knew
you couldn't stop smoking.

01:52:22.110 --> 01:52:24.992
Hey, I'm only smoking to take my mind off
my dog-biscuit problem, okay?

01:52:24.992 --> 01:52:27.948
- Hey, what dog-biscuit problem?
- Well, I've been chasing more cars lately

01:52:28.116 --> 01:52:31.160
and, uh, you know, when I try and
lick my balls, I keep falling off the couch.

01:52:31.661 --> 01:52:35.456
Jesus Christ. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
I'm driving. Other side.

01:52:35.623 --> 01:52:38.542
I got no dispute. I just came over here
to open the door for you.

01:52:38.710 --> 01:52:40.210
What, what, what... Thank you
for opening the door for me.

01:52:40.378 --> 01:52:43.881
- You need some help? An old fella like you...
- No, no, no, I'll show you a fella my age.

01:52:44.048 --> 01:52:45.883
- Who's a grumpy bastard?
- I'm a grumpy bastard.

01:52:47.302 --> 01:52:48.844
- Hey, you know something, Riggs?
- What?

01:52:49.012 --> 01:52:52.765
When I do retire,
I hope your next partner is just like you.

01:52:53.308 --> 01:52:56.852
That's not gonna happen, Rog, cause there's winners
and there's losers, and God wouldn't do that to me.

01:52:57.020 --> 01:52:58.353
Well, He did it to me.

01:52:59.439 --> 01:53:00.856
I know.

01:53:01.046 --> 01:53:03.131
- Hey...
- See what I mean?

01:53:05.195 --> 01:53:08.447
My point, exactly.
- Son of a bitch. Shit.

01:53:11.743 --> 01:53:13.243
Stay away from my daughter.

01:53:13.411 --> 01:53:15.704
Oh, you can't be serious.
What are you talking about?

01:53:15.872 --> 01:53:17.706
I saw what it was.
You kissed Rianne.

01:53:17.874 --> 01:53:19.708
She kissed me.
Can I help it if she finds me irresistible?

01:53:19.876 --> 01:53:22.836
- That's not the point.
- It's a platonic peck on the cheek between friends.

01:53:23.004 --> 01:53:25.631
Okay. If it's just friendship,
try shaking hands next time.

01:53:25.799 --> 01:53:27.753
What's your problem?
You're not getting enough fiber in your diet?

01:53:27.753 --> 01:53:30.801
- I'm getting enough fiber in my diet.
- I'm spoken for, okay? I'm spoken for.

01:53:30.801 --> 01:53:33.180
I'm gonna pick Lorna up
from the hospital this afternoon.

01:53:33.348 --> 01:53:35.224
- Yeah?
- Yeah, we're practically, uh...

01:53:35.391 --> 01:53:37.810
- You're serious?
- Well, we got a dog and everything.

01:53:37.977 --> 01:53:40.604
I figure I can, uh, you know,
make ends meet.

01:53:49.239 --> 01:53:52.407
<i>All units. All units.
Code 2, high.</i>

01:53:52.575 --> 01:53:55.202
Hey, hey, don't even think
about it, Riggs. Hey, hey, don't even try.

01:53:55.370 --> 01:53:58.497
This is us, rolling to Code 2, high,
at Verrina Place.

01:53:58.665 --> 01:54:01.458
Shit, Riggs. Hey, hey, this time
we wait for the bomb squad.

01:54:01.626 --> 01:54:04.211
You think I wanna end up
in uniform again?

01:57:06.811 --> 01:57:10.981
<i>20-William-12, the REA
bomb squad's en route. All units.</i>

01:57:11.149 --> 01:57:12.941
<i>Those guys gonna
get in the way again?</i>

01:57:13.109 --> 01:57:15.902
Okay, there it is.
You happy? Let's go.

01:57:16.070 --> 01:57:18.071
Ah, we ain't seen nothing yet,
though, Rog.

01:57:18.239 --> 01:57:20.782
Come on, just get me up there closer.
- It's roped off. The boys have rules.

01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:23.326
- Can't see the bomb squad anywhere around.
- They're-they're coming. They're coming.

01:57:23.494 --> 01:57:26.455
Okay, all right. All right.
Stop here and I'll just get out.

01:57:26.622 --> 01:57:29.374
No, no, don't get out
of the car, Riggs. No. Riggs!

01:57:29.542 --> 01:57:31.835
Tell me, Rog,
was it red wire, blue... ?

01:57:32.086 --> 01:57:34.296
Let's get out of here!
Step on the gas.

01:57:34.464 --> 01:57:35.881
They're never gonna believe this.

01:57:36.049 --> 01:57:38.633
- I hope nobody saw us.
- They'll blame me.

01:57:38.951 --> 01:57:39.919
All right?
Let's keep cool.

01:57:39.919 --> 01:57:42.279
Oh, I think you better get your girdle
out of mothballs, Roger.

01:57:42.279 --> 01:57:44.056
Ah, yeah, they're gonna say
"Back in uniform again".

01:57:44.223 --> 01:57:46.850
- Try one that fits.
- Ten more years of this. Ten more years.

01:57:47.018 --> 01:57:49.216
- Oh. I'm too old for this shit.
- I'm too old for this shit.
