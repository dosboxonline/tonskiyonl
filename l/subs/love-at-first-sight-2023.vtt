08:59.789 --> 09:00.915
Oh yeah. Go for it.

[guy] <i>You did say 11:00
you were getting in?</i>

09:05.002 --> 09:07.213
No, it's 10:00. I emailed you.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.464
You did?

09:08.464 --> 09:10.716
I blame the gym's Wi-Fi. It's a bit dodgy.

09:10.716 --> 09:13.261
[Oliver] <i>You've got one job tomorrow.
Pick me up at 10:00.</i>

09:13.261 --> 09:14.387
Don't worry. I'll be there.

09:14.387 --> 09:18.266
And by the way, I've got a little surprise
planned for you, so... be ready for that.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.142
What? No, I don't like surprises.

09:20.142 --> 09:21.978
It's a good one. You can't be annoyed.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.063
I've warned you,
so you can't be as pissed.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.189

No, sorry, Wi-Fi's breaking up.
No, I can't hear you.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.917

- [Hadley] Okay.

09:45.459 --> 09:48.754
So if claustrophobia
is one of your biggest fears,

09:48.754 --> 09:51.299
then why are you about
to embark on a seven-hour flight?

09:51.299 --> 09:52.883
[Hadley] That <i>is</i> a very good question.

09:52.883 --> 09:53.926
A wedding.

09:55.136 --> 09:56.262
Same as you?

09:57.096 --> 09:58.139
[Oliver] Right.

09:58.931 --> 10:01.017
That is actually my loungewear.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.185
So I like to relax
in a finely pressed suit.

they'll be separated in a crowd
and never see each other again.

18:01.205 --> 18:02.539
[clicks tongue] So...

18:03.582 --> 18:05.542
- So you're going to your dad's wedding.
- Yep.

18:06.043 --> 18:07.753
And you've never met his fiancée.

18:07.753 --> 18:09.171
- Nope.
- How does that work?

18:11.381 --> 18:12.382
Well...

18:12.382 --> 18:18.305
[laughs] Um, it starts when he gets
a job teaching poetry at Oxford.

18:18.305 --> 18:21.100
Then after promising
that that will only last for a semester,

18:21.100 --> 18:24.436
he files for divorce from your mom

18:24.436 --> 18:27.523

with a woman named Charlotte

18:27.523 --> 18:30.109
and proceeds to ask her to marry him.

18:30.109 --> 18:33.570
And then he makes you,
who he hasn't seen for over a year,

18:33.570 --> 18:36.490
fly across the ocean in a tin can

18:36.490 --> 18:39.868
so you can stand next to him
wearing a dress the color of a bruise.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.286
That's awful.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.539
- Yeah.
- [both laugh]

18:43.539 --> 18:48.168
If it's, uh, any consolation,
50% of marriages do end in divorce.

18:48.877 --> 18:50.129
That means 50% don't.

18:50.129 --> 18:54.591
Yeah, but I mean, the chances
of this happening were incredibly high.

18:54.591 --> 18:56.385
Is that supposed
to make me feel any better?

18:56.385 --> 18:57.886
- Doesn't it?
- [Hadley] No.

18:57.886 --> 18:59.471
I think it just sucks.

19:00.305 --> 19:01.974
You know, the worst part is that

19:02.975 --> 19:04.643
he's gonna get up tomorrow,

19:04.643 --> 19:06.395
and he's gonna make
the exact same promises

19:06.395 --> 19:07.479
that he just broke.

19:08.272 --> 19:10.023
I get that people can fall in love again.

19:10.023 --> 19:11.316
I just feel like, if it's real,

19:11.316 --> 19:13.152
why do you have to try
so hard to prove it?

19:13.152 --> 19:18.615
Why do you have to throw this big,
grand party to rub it in everyone's face?

19:19.449 --> 19:22.244
I think that real love isn't about that.

19:23.287 --> 19:25.414
Real love is about finding someone

19:26.206 --> 19:28.625
that will hold your hand
when life gets rough.

19:29.501 --> 19:30.377
And that's it?

19:31.420 --> 19:36.008
No wedding, no marriage, just...
someone to hold your hand through life?

19:36.008 --> 19:37.676
[gentle music playing]

19:37.676 --> 19:38.677
Yeah, pretty much.

19:42.681 --> 19:46.018
I like that...
weddings are a promise, I guess.

19:48.228 --> 19:50.189
Not everyone keeps their promises.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.774
[gentle music fades]

19:52.774 --> 19:54.067
Anyways,

19:55.027 --> 19:56.820
that's my wedding. [laughs]

19:56.820 --> 19:57.863
What's yours?

19:57.863 --> 20:01.283
Please say something dramatic,
like your stepmom's marrying your uncle

20:01.283 --> 20:02.618
or something like that.

20:02.618 --> 20:05.037
- [chuckles] Um...
- So what'll it be?

20:05.037 --> 20:09.041
Some delicious chicken and vegetables,
or some... very dry fish?

20:09.625 --> 20:10.709
- Chicken.
- [narrator] Mm.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.127
- Right.
- [Hadley] Um...

20:12.127 --> 20:14.379
I'm gonna go for the fish...

20:16.173 --> 20:17.007
Chicken.

20:17.007 --> 20:18.425
Excellent choice, madam.

20:19.968 --> 20:21.929
- Wow, our second dinner date.
- [Hadley] Hmm.

20:21.929 --> 20:23.805
Things are moving fast.

20:23.805 --> 20:25.724
[upbeat music playing]

20:25.724 --> 20:27.643
[engines whirring]

20:33.065 --> 20:34.149
[flight attendant] For you.

20:45.077 --> 20:46.119
[upbeat music fades]

20:52.209 --> 20:54.086
[inhales deeply] All right?

20:54.086 --> 20:55.420
Yeah. Sorry, I...

20:56.296 --> 20:57.339
Oh my God. [laughs]

20:58.423 --> 21:00.300
- I mean...
- Sexy, I know.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.636
- Perfect fit.
- I thought so.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.012
- Look cute.
- [laughs]

21:05.681 --> 21:07.182
Oh, you weren't lying about Dickens.

21:07.182 --> 21:08.267
Oh, um...

21:08.892 --> 21:11.228
[clicks tongue]
...I actually haven't read this one.

21:11.228 --> 21:13.021
- Hmm. Looks like someone has.
- [Hadley] Yeah.

21:13.021 --> 21:17.150
Um, it was my dad's.
He gave it to me after the divorce.

21:17.150 --> 21:19.278
It was a thing that we would do.

21:19.278 --> 21:22.281
He would give me books he loved,
and then I would love them too.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.032
[somber music playing]

21:24.866 --> 21:26.326
[dad] It's one of his best ones.

21:26.326 --> 21:28.328
I've read it... at least a dozen times.

21:28.829 --> 21:31.915
You know, I don't get to recommend books
as often to you now.

21:32.499 --> 21:35.752
But certain ones are too important
to get lost in all this.

21:37.796 --> 21:38.630
Thanks.

21:39.214 --> 21:41.008
So, should we hit the slopes?

21:44.011 --> 21:46.888
Yeah. Um, just gotta pee first.

21:50.851 --> 21:52.227
[somber music building]

21:57.065 --> 21:59.860
[Hadley] "'Is it better
to have had a good thing and lost it,

22:00.360 --> 22:01.737
or never to have had it?'"

22:07.784 --> 22:09.369
[Hadley] <i>That's why I'm giving it back.</i>

22:09.911 --> 22:11.621
[Oliver] Without having read it.

22:11.621 --> 22:12.873
Without having read it.

22:13.707 --> 22:15.417
Right. [sighs]

22:18.503 --> 22:21.840
[inhales sharply] Do you wanna join me
at the cinema?

22:21.840 --> 22:25.177
Make our first date dinner
and a nice, cheesy rom-com?

22:26.595 --> 22:28.096
I'm down for a cheesy rom-com.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.350
As long as there's a happy ending.

22:32.434 --> 22:33.352
You know what I meant.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.062
- [laughs]
- Okay.

22:35.062 --> 22:36.646
- I meant like--
- No. No, it's fine.

22:36.646 --> 22:38.315
- In the movie with the characters...
- Hey.

22:38.315 --> 22:40.442
- I like happy endings.
- [Hadley giggles]

22:40.442 --> 22:41.735
[sighs]

23:13.225 --> 23:14.643
[mom] <i>Oh, let us come to the gate.</i>

23:14.643 --> 23:16.520
- Let us come with you.
- Mom, I'm 21.

23:16.520 --> 23:17.896
- [mom] Just come to the--
- No!

23:17.896 --> 23:19.147
Okay, well, work hard,

23:19.147 --> 23:21.358
but... don't forget to play.

23:21.358 --> 23:22.275
I will.

23:22.275 --> 23:24.653
- And make sure you eat... properly.
- [Oliver] Same to you.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.488
[mom, softly] I'm so proud of you.

23:27.197 --> 23:28.407
Okay. Go.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.324
Go on then.

23:30.200 --> 23:31.034
Live your life.

23:31.743 --> 23:33.370
Have a grand adventure!

23:33.870 --> 23:35.372
- [Oliver sniffles]
- [mom] Farewell!

23:35.372 --> 23:36.498
[Luther] Toodle-oo.

23:36.498 --> 23:38.083
[mom laughs] Bye!

23:38.083 --> 23:39.626
[pencil continues scratching]

23:41.795 --> 23:42.796
[gentle music fades]

23:42.796 --> 23:43.713
[Hadley exhales]

23:56.226 --> 23:57.602
Are you preparing a speech?

23:59.062 --> 23:59.896
Yeah.

24:00.897 --> 24:01.940
Best man?

24:03.233 --> 24:05.444
- That's what they tell me.
- [Hadley chuckles]

24:06.403 --> 24:07.612
You get some rest?

24:07.612 --> 24:08.613
Little bit.

24:11.158 --> 24:14.661
I was thinking about it, and...
I don't think you should give it back.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.121
The book.

24:16.705 --> 24:17.539
Why not?

24:18.832 --> 24:21.877
Well, historically,
you and your dad were very close,

24:21.877 --> 24:25.839
which means the odds are
you will eventually forgive him.

24:27.048 --> 24:28.925
So you might as well just do it now.

24:29.843 --> 24:31.678
[clicks tongue] You and the math thing.

24:31.678 --> 24:33.180
- [Oliver chuckles]
- Mm.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.974
[scoffs] Yeah, drives my brother nuts too.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.392
You have siblings?

24:37.392 --> 24:39.144
Uh, yeah, one.

24:39.144 --> 24:41.313
He's two years younger. Luther.

24:41.313 --> 24:43.190
Does he live in London?

24:43.190 --> 24:44.774
Yeah, with our mum and dad.

24:44.774 --> 24:46.276
Well, until a few months ago

24:46.276 --> 24:49.696
when he decided to buy
a garish green Sprinter van.

24:49.696 --> 24:51.698
Hmm. Those are cool.

24:51.698 --> 24:52.699
[Oliver] Mm.

24:53.617 --> 24:55.202
That's what he tells me.

24:55.202 --> 24:57.829
Are you guys close, historically?

25:01.041 --> 25:03.543
- You ask a lot of questions, don't you?
- Are you?

25:05.921 --> 25:07.506
Our mum got sick when we were kids.

25:08.256 --> 25:10.634
So, yeah. But we're both very different.

25:11.927 --> 25:13.803
It's fine, though. I'm used to it now.

25:15.972 --> 25:17.265
She okay now, your mom?

25:18.183 --> 25:20.936
Uh, she was in remission
for 14 years, but it came back.

25:23.146 --> 25:23.980
I'm sorry.

25:25.315 --> 25:26.775
[clicks tongue] Oh no...

25:26.775 --> 25:30.695
[acoustic version of "I Wanna Dance
with Somebody (Who Loves Me)" playing]

25:36.576 --> 25:38.703
You're sort of dangerous.
Do you know that?

25:39.663 --> 25:40.497
Me?

25:44.376 --> 25:45.210
Yeah.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.629
I'm way too honest with you.

25:52.926 --> 25:53.802
[inhales sharply]

25:53.802 --> 25:58.557
Anyway, I should nip to the loo
and then get some sleep, I think.

Shoreditch, I think?

Shoreditch, yeah.
That's very cool. Very hipster.

28:31.459 --> 28:33.461
What about you? Where do you go for yours?

28:34.879 --> 28:36.256
I have to be in Peckham at 1:00.

It's at an old chapel where my parents
used to do amateur dramatics.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.344
Well, at least you have till 1:00.

28:41.344 --> 28:44.013
- My ceremony starts at noon, so...
- Noon?

28:44.848 --> 28:46.599
Not the reaction I needed. [laughs]

28:46.599 --> 28:47.642
You should be fine.

So, your family's
not a collection of stick figures?

- Mine definitely is.

Well, yes, so what happened was
that Val and I were planning my funeral,

and it was just turning into
such a brilliant show

46:44.009 --> 46:47.221

I... I wanted to be alive to see it, so...

46:47.221 --> 46:48.722
And you <i>are</i> right.

that loved not at first sight?" [chuckles]

47:34.643 --> 47:37.145

the most beautiful story together
with our two darling, dashing,

47:47.114 --> 47:49.575

to each one of you for being a part of it.

47:57.207 --> 47:58.333

Let's eat as much as we possibly can

48:05.424 --> 48:07.092
and get really drunk. [laughs]

- [Tess] And the only rule of the day is...

48:17.060 --> 48:18.896
[tearfully] ...don't forget to say goodbye.

[softly] Okay. Ta-da!

I've read the data.

I know that if you started with the chemo
with an anti-inflammatory diet,

51:48.146 --> 51:51.149
you could have another 6 months,
12 months, maybe even 18 months.

Why?

It is pretty unusual for somebody

It's kind of a genius idea, though.
