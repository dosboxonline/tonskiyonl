And between the slices,
well, that's your butter.

36:06.131 --> 36:08.834
Just figured that out
a few years ago.

36:08.934 --> 36:12.671
Now, Chevron spent
$53 billion dollars

36:12.771 --> 36:15.541
to buy a drilling company
to get it out.

36:15.641 --> 36:19.378
So we can assume the leases
on 400 wells,

36:19.478 --> 36:21.547
but we're gonna have
to drill horizontal

36:21.647 --> 36:23.147
and we're gonna have
to frack it.

36:23.148 --> 36:25.650
A deal like that's called
a farm-out.

36:25.651 --> 36:28.053
So, we have access to 400 wells.

36:28.153 --> 36:30.856
But it's gonna cost between
11 and 18 million dollars

36:30.956 --> 36:31.957
for each well.

36:32.057 --> 36:34.059
We agreed to the first nine.

36:34.159 --> 36:36.228
That's $162 million dollars.

36:36.328 --> 36:38.264
Now, if we hit
on the first four,

36:38.364 --> 36:41.233
that means we're obligated
to drill nine more.

36:41.333 --> 36:43.569
If we hit on four more,
then we're committed to 27.

36:43.669 --> 36:45.103
You see where
I'm going with that?

36:45.203 --> 36:47.072
- I do.
- Our deal

36:47.205 --> 36:50.376
is that we recoup
on strikes to 120%

36:50.476 --> 36:52.176
and then
we start revenue sharing.

36:52.177 --> 36:55.012
It's a pretty good deal
when it's two percent interest.

36:55.013 --> 36:58.516
But at 12%,
we're bankrupt in a month

36:58.517 --> 37:00.752
if it turns out
the first nine are dry holes.

37:00.852 --> 37:03.221
Okay, so what do you want
from me?

37:03.322 --> 37:06.724
Well, each strike has
to pay for itself

37:06.725 --> 37:09.094
and then it has to pay
for the next one.

37:09.194 --> 37:10.829
So we got to get ahead
of the bank.

37:10.929 --> 37:13.063
You have to make a deal
that pays for the whole thing

37:13.064 --> 37:14.766
on the first home run.

37:14.900 --> 37:18.069
Now, Nate here is gonna
take you through the numbers.

37:27.178 --> 37:28.614

37:28.714 --> 37:30.748
You mean "wells."

37:30.749 --> 37:31.983
Too shallow.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.251

to be?

between 10,000 and 13,000 feet.

37:36.555 --> 37:38.255
But you got
to drill at an angle,

37:38.256 --> 37:40.191
- and then you got to frack it.
- Frack it.

37:40.292 --> 37:42.994
You shoot a shit ton
of salt water downhole,

37:43.128 --> 37:44.796
and you squeeze all that oil out
of the fractures,

37:44.896 --> 37:47.633
then you pump it up,
separate the water.

37:47.733 --> 37:50.436
Technology...
it changed the game out here.

37:50.536 --> 37:51.937
