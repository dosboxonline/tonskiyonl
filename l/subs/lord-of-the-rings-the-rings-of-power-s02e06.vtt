WEBVTT

00:08.375 --> 00:11.125
[Brânk] The Harfoots, where are they?

00:13.416 --> 00:15.166
[Stranger] <i>I was hoping
to find my friends.</i>

00:15.166 --> 00:17.333
Well, there's what you're searchin' for

00:17.333 --> 00:19.125
and there's what you find, now,
isn't there?

00:21.666 --> 00:23.291
[Stranger] <i>This... magic.</i>

00:23.291 --> 00:27.750
Might you teach me how to wield a staff?

00:27.750 --> 00:32.041
It's yours to wield already,
if you prove yourself worthy of it.

00:32.750 --> 00:34.500
[Elendil] Valandil tells me
that in the Old Quarter,

00:34.500 --> 00:37.166
prayers ascend night and day for you.

00:37.166 --> 00:40.666
<i>It was you, who opened my heart again
to the way of The Faithful.</i>

00:40.666 --> 00:42.666
But together we can fight.

00:42.666 --> 00:45.333
[Queen Míriel] <i>Not every battle
must be fought to be won.</i>

00:45.958 --> 00:47.500
[Kemen grunts]

00:47.500 --> 00:48.500
[coughs]

00:48.500 --> 00:52.583
[Kemen] <i>Inform the jailer he was the one
who started the uprising.</i>

00:53.125 --> 00:55.958
[King Durin] <i>Stone-singers speak
of hearing the mountain.</i>

00:55.958 --> 00:58.666
With this Ring, I can see it.

00:58.666 --> 01:03.458
We have barely taken a thimble
from the ocean of her riches.

01:04.125 --> 01:05.458
[Prince Durin IV] <i>He's changed.</i>

01:05.458 --> 01:08.500
Greed is not his way.
It never has been.

01:08.500 --> 01:12.291
Is it possible the Ring he's wearing--

01:12.291 --> 01:16.083
No. There simply cannot be
a fault in your Rings.

01:16.083 --> 01:18.750
[Prince Durin IV] <i>Then maybe,
the fault's in the Ring-maker.</i>

01:18.750 --> 01:22.625
<i>How much do you really know
about this Annatar?</i>

01:22.625 --> 01:23.583
[distorted voices whispering]

01:23.583 --> 01:26.500
Did you alter the Dwarven Rings,
yes or no?

01:27.541 --> 01:28.541
[Annatar] <i>No.</i>

01:28.541 --> 01:29.666
We did.

01:34.916 --> 01:39.000
We must atone for our mistakes
by completing the Rings together.

01:39.000 --> 01:42.500
The Nine must redeem the Seven.

01:42.500 --> 01:44.625
<i>They must redeem us all.</i>

01:45.166 --> 01:46.541
[Elrond] <i>The Orcs are not in Mordor.</i>

01:46.541 --> 01:48.875
<i>A legion of them are headed for Eregion.</i>

01:49.375 --> 01:53.416
<i>Galadriel was right. You must send
the army to Eregion this moment!</i>

01:53.416 --> 01:56.041
[Orcs snarling and cackling]

01:56.041 --> 01:57.958
[Orcs exclaiming]

01:57.958 --> 01:59.708
[Adar, in Sindarin] I brought you here

01:59.708 --> 02:01.166
not as a prisoner...

02:01.166 --> 02:02.666
but as a potential ally.

02:02.666 --> 02:04.666
For we share a common enemy.

02:10.416 --> 02:12.416
[opening theme music playing]

04:08.000 --> 04:09.000
[Orc 1] You shut up.

04:09.000 --> 04:10.541
[Orc 2] They'll call us deserters.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.666
[Orc 1] I don't care what they call us.

04:15.666 --> 04:18.958
Anything's better than dying
to help Adar chase a ghost.

04:25.625 --> 04:26.625
[twigs snap]

04:28.958 --> 04:30.291
[both grunt]

05:16.291 --> 05:20.583
Ye Rings of Men, why do you still defy me?

05:22.166 --> 05:25.458
You, who live not, breathe not,

05:25.458 --> 05:28.541
possess not mind nor will?

05:28.541 --> 05:31.958
What pride is woven in your inmost self,

05:33.625 --> 05:35.375
that you resist my hand?

05:39.208 --> 05:40.208
Again.

05:41.125 --> 05:42.458
More silver.

05:43.375 --> 05:44.458
More <i>mithril.</i>

05:45.000 --> 05:46.583
There is no more <i>mithril.</i>

05:46.583 --> 05:49.125
The Dwarves have been tardy
with their delivery.

05:50.666 --> 05:52.000
So chase them down.

05:52.000 --> 05:55.458
We have tried, my lord.
All our dispatches go unanswered.

05:55.458 --> 05:56.958
Must I do everything myself?

05:56.958 --> 05:59.041
We are laboring as hard as we can.

06:02.583 --> 06:04.958
Some of us have noticed you seem...

06:05.833 --> 06:08.666
especially ill-tempered of late, my lord.

06:26.416 --> 06:28.250
What is your name again, smith?

06:30.208 --> 06:32.708
You mean, you don't remember?

06:32.708 --> 06:34.083
Of course I remember.

06:35.625 --> 06:38.000
- Just, just... give me a moment.
- [doors open]

06:38.000 --> 06:40.333
- [Annatar] Lord Celebrimbor.
- Give me a moment, I said!

06:42.625 --> 06:44.375
Everyone take a respite.

06:53.791 --> 06:57.291
[sighs] Mirdania. She's called Mirdania.

06:59.500 --> 07:01.750
You cannot be expected
to remember everything.

07:04.583 --> 07:08.958
No, just, it's simple things, even.

07:09.916 --> 07:15.208
Earlier, I could've sworn I left
my creasing hammer just here, and...

07:16.416 --> 07:17.625
You mean that hammer?

07:19.458 --> 07:21.458
[mysterious music playing]

07:28.333 --> 07:29.333
Yes.

07:36.375 --> 07:37.375
[chuckles]

07:40.458 --> 07:42.541
My mind must be going.

07:43.458 --> 07:45.541
Or you are going so deep into it,

07:46.166 --> 07:48.583
coming out again
has become an incredible burden.

07:50.458 --> 07:52.833
- Yeah.
- So deep.

07:53.791 --> 07:56.416
I imagine at times you must be tempted

07:57.666 --> 07:59.541
simply to stay there awhile,

08:00.416 --> 08:01.833
gain some clarity.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.250
Hmm.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.708
I am well.

08:10.375 --> 08:12.416
I'm just fatigued.

08:12.916 --> 08:15.750
Then I am afraid
you will not like the tidings I bring.

08:17.750 --> 08:19.500
Your people demand an audience.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.333
No, no.

08:22.791 --> 08:26.125
You are the Lord of Eregion.
You have responsibilities.

08:26.125 --> 08:30.000
Yes, and my greatest responsibility
is to the Rings.

08:30.750 --> 08:35.125
Until the Nine are complete,
nothing else matters.

08:37.750 --> 08:38.750
Very well, then.

08:39.958 --> 08:41.083
As you wish.

08:42.583 --> 08:44.166
Oh, there is something more.

08:45.708 --> 08:48.833
The Dwarves are late with our <i>mithril.</i>

08:51.541 --> 08:53.583
Could you see to it?

08:53.583 --> 08:55.083
At once.

09:08.958 --> 09:10.958
[indistinct chatter]

09:16.125 --> 09:19.041
The Greatest of Elven-smiths
is consumed by his work.

09:20.291 --> 09:24.208
He asks that I handle all matters
of administration in his stead.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.250
Now, what seems to be at issue?

09:31.333 --> 09:32.375
Show him.

09:33.791 --> 09:34.791
Show me what?

09:35.666 --> 09:39.000
This gatehouse is typically athrum
with artisans and merchants

09:39.000 --> 09:40.333
traveling into the city.

09:40.333 --> 09:42.416
But it all strangely halted yester-eve.

09:42.416 --> 09:44.750
[Commander Malendol] We sent
a search party across the river

09:44.750 --> 09:46.583
to see if there was an obstruction
upon the road.

09:46.583 --> 09:48.666
But only one soldier returned.

09:48.666 --> 09:49.750
Where is he?

09:53.666 --> 09:58.083
Washed up this morning.
He appeared to be carrying a message.

10:05.750 --> 10:07.000
Bury him.

10:10.416 --> 10:11.708
Show this to no one.

10:18.958 --> 10:20.916
And shall I inform Lord Celebrimbor?

10:20.916 --> 10:22.083
No.

10:22.916 --> 10:26.333
He has asked me to see to it
that no one is permitted to disturb him.

10:27.833 --> 10:29.125
Not even the smiths.

10:30.125 --> 10:31.875
He has stripped us of our duties?

10:33.750 --> 10:34.958
Yes, I am afraid so.

10:36.916 --> 10:39.583
Was it that business
about him forgetting my name?

10:39.583 --> 10:41.250
I know I was brusque with him, but...

10:41.750 --> 10:44.250
He's not himself, Mirdania.

10:46.541 --> 10:49.208
For now, all we can do
is leave him in solitude.

10:49.958 --> 10:52.916
Give him time. And pray.

10:54.166 --> 10:56.916
Pray that he finishes this work
before it finishes him.

11:09.708 --> 11:11.416
Can I trust you...

11:12.250 --> 11:15.083
to make sure
the others respect his wishes as well?

11:16.625 --> 11:18.458
Of course, my lord.

11:27.000 --> 11:30.208
My lord, the carving. On the body.

11:31.083 --> 11:32.541
What did it say?

11:39.125 --> 11:40.458
"Where is He?"

11:46.291 --> 11:48.291
[dramatic music playing]

12:27.291 --> 12:30.791
During my brief time in your capture,

12:32.166 --> 12:34.583
you seemed intent on finding Sauron.

12:35.375 --> 12:38.916
One might even say, consumed by it,

12:40.416 --> 12:41.958
the way one always is,

12:41.958 --> 12:44.833
once he has wormed his way
inside your mind.

12:45.541 --> 12:47.333
You know nothing of my mind.

12:49.833 --> 12:51.166
You yielded to him.

12:51.958 --> 12:53.291
I resisted.

12:53.791 --> 12:55.583
For a while, perhaps.

12:58.416 --> 13:00.791
But sooner or later, he sees you.

13:02.916 --> 13:07.083
Not just who you are,
but who you wish to be.

13:07.833 --> 13:11.875
His eye bores a hole
and the rest of him slithers in.

13:14.333 --> 13:20.000
For a while, he even makes you believe
that his power has become yours.

13:22.291 --> 13:23.875
Irresistible power...

13:24.791 --> 13:28.416
that makes every desire's fulfillment
seem inevitable.

13:29.208 --> 13:30.750
An ocean of color

13:32.083 --> 13:35.458
against which everything else
feels forever thereafter--

13:35.458 --> 13:38.291
A dull gray.

13:45.583 --> 13:47.083
What did he promise you?

13:49.041 --> 13:50.250
An army.

13:51.833 --> 13:53.666
Do you want to know what he offered me?

13:55.208 --> 13:56.208
I care not.

13:58.291 --> 13:59.291
Children.

14:00.166 --> 14:03.791
Then it would seem he gave us both
what we desired.

14:04.291 --> 14:05.625
You see,

14:07.125 --> 14:09.916
it is not his lies
which must be extinguished.

14:11.666 --> 14:12.958
It is him.

14:14.833 --> 14:16.666
And I can help you do it.

14:18.625 --> 14:20.500
I can help you destroy Sauron.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.708
What help could you possibly provide, Orc?

14:25.708 --> 14:26.791
[in Black Speech] <i>Uruk.</i>

14:39.583 --> 14:42.041
[in English] Morgoth's crown. I was told--

14:42.041 --> 14:44.166
There are many stories of what happened,

14:44.166 --> 14:46.875
after the Silmarils were pried
from its settings.

14:47.625 --> 14:50.833
But I was there
when Sauron re-fired it to fit himself.

14:52.166 --> 14:54.541
I was there when he kneeled to be crowned.

14:56.750 --> 15:02.166
And I was the one
who used its power, to slay him.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.208
If what you say is true,

15:08.416 --> 15:09.541
why did he return?

15:09.541 --> 15:11.916
Because I had not yet found you.

15:13.125 --> 15:14.833
What part am I to play in this?

15:14.833 --> 15:18.416
It is said the Three Elven Rings
saved your kind from fading.

15:19.875 --> 15:21.041
Is it true?

15:23.375 --> 15:28.000
If it is, then perhaps together,

15:28.000 --> 15:30.666
this crown and your Rings
would be powerful enough

15:30.666 --> 15:33.250
to truly destroy Sauron forever.

15:35.708 --> 15:38.708
The Deceiver believes
he is still beyond my grasp.

15:40.458 --> 15:42.666
But I know he hides in Eregion.

15:44.583 --> 15:48.375
And I suspect you know for certain...

15:55.541 --> 15:57.916
Halbrand is Sauron.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.416
Isn't he?

16:05.500 --> 16:07.666
The fate of that city

16:08.416 --> 16:11.666
now rests on your ability
to put aside your pride.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.750
I suggest you find the will to do so.

16:17.958 --> 16:19.166
If you can.

16:34.708 --> 16:36.041
We will speak again.

16:43.708 --> 16:45.708
[dramatic musical flourish]

16:51.458 --> 16:52.625
[Ar-Pharazôn] Outlawry.

16:54.750 --> 17:00.416
Incitement of a violent conflagration
that led to loss of life.

17:01.458 --> 17:05.375
And last, but most odious,

17:06.500 --> 17:08.500
the crime of high treason.

17:09.875 --> 17:15.708
Taken in sum, these hideous breaches
of law warrant a sentence of death.

17:15.708 --> 17:16.958
[man] Yes!

17:18.041 --> 17:19.166
[crowd clamoring]

17:20.958 --> 17:22.666
[man 3] He doesn't deserve
to be put to death.

17:22.666 --> 17:24.333
- [woman] Well, maybe.
- [clamor dies down]

17:24.333 --> 17:25.416
However,

17:27.166 --> 17:30.625
given his many years
of faithful service to our kingdom,

17:31.750 --> 17:35.458
it is the judgment of this court
that the accused be set free.

17:35.458 --> 17:38.041
[people shouting, jeering]

17:43.833 --> 17:45.291
[shouting] Set free...

17:47.000 --> 17:48.583
[clamor dies down]

17:48.583 --> 17:54.291
Set free, provided, of course,
he renounces his crimes

17:55.958 --> 17:59.291
and pledges his loyalty
to Númenor's true ruler.

18:05.625 --> 18:10.166
Elendil, son of Amandil,
do you renounce your crimes?

18:23.375 --> 18:24.375
I do.

18:25.666 --> 18:27.458
[crowd clamoring]

18:27.458 --> 18:32.333
And do you accept Ar-Pharazôn
as Númenor's true King?

18:43.083 --> 18:44.291
I do not.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.458
Speak louder, Elendil,

18:48.416 --> 18:50.958
so that the assembled
may hear you properly.

18:55.541 --> 18:56.791
I do not!

18:56.791 --> 18:59.041
[crowd jeer]

18:59.041 --> 19:05.000
For Númenor's true ruler is now,
until the end of her days,

19:05.000 --> 19:08.750
Míriel, daughter of Tar-Palantír!

19:11.083 --> 19:15.541
And the only traitor here is you!

19:15.541 --> 19:17.625
[dramatic music playing]

19:34.000 --> 19:35.750
[Kemen] Now what are we to do with him?

19:36.416 --> 19:38.458
You have done quite enough, boy.

19:42.875 --> 19:45.833
Perhaps we should let the Valar
decide his fate.

19:47.458 --> 19:50.666
If The Faithful wish to live
by the old traditions,

19:50.666 --> 19:52.208
they ought to die by them as well.

19:59.541 --> 20:00.375
[screams]

20:03.666 --> 20:05.125
[Nori screams, scream fades]

20:05.666 --> 20:06.750
Nori.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.041
Snorin'? Who's snorin'?

20:12.125 --> 20:13.500
No one.

20:13.500 --> 20:16.583
I... I saw something.

20:17.583 --> 20:21.250
The Secret Fire whispers to us,
if we have ears to hear.

20:22.333 --> 20:24.666
It tells us things. Even shows us things.

20:25.541 --> 20:30.208
Does it show us things that will be?
Or things that only might be?

20:31.125 --> 20:34.791
It shows tomorrow's clouds
as clear as yesterday's sunshine.

20:36.500 --> 20:40.666
How do I learn to master its power?
To fight back against the darkness?

20:40.666 --> 20:43.291
What does the Secret Fire need
with you as a master?

20:43.291 --> 20:46.208
But if I cannot master it,
then how am I to use it?

20:49.583 --> 20:54.541
Every trial that you have met thus far,
you have failed.

20:55.541 --> 20:57.666
Fail the trial before you now,

20:59.166 --> 21:00.958
and there will not be another.

21:02.083 --> 21:03.791
Tell me what I must do.

21:06.625 --> 21:09.708
Follow ol' Tom. For he will show you.

21:09.708 --> 21:11.791
[horses whinnying]

21:17.291 --> 21:18.750
[Nori] <i>Why don't you just leave?</i>

21:19.333 --> 21:21.458
Get clear of 'em. Run away.

21:21.458 --> 21:23.000
And where exactly would we go?

21:23.000 --> 21:25.458
Why... anywhere you want.

21:26.666 --> 21:30.291
Harfoots find a new place to live
every month.

21:30.291 --> 21:31.208
[Gundabale] Hmm.

21:34.375 --> 21:39.583
This Smial, my mum and her folks
dug for me.

21:39.583 --> 21:41.500
- I was born in it.
- [somber music playing]

21:44.875 --> 21:49.041
I've been tendin' that tree
since I was big enough to balance a rake.

21:52.041 --> 21:55.166
I married my Bramgar in its shadow.

21:58.541 --> 22:02.666
And last spring, when he passed,

22:05.166 --> 22:06.583
I buried him under it.

22:11.041 --> 22:13.041
And one day, I'll be buried beside him.

22:21.500 --> 22:24.291
Every one of these Smials
has a story like that.

22:24.291 --> 22:26.375
- [indistinct chatter]
- [somber music continues]

22:30.791 --> 22:35.000
You see, this place,
it's not just where we live.

22:37.041 --> 22:38.208
It's our home.

22:39.541 --> 22:40.958
It's me.

22:42.250 --> 22:44.333
- Nori--
- No. I got you into this rut.

22:45.416 --> 22:48.291
Maybe it's up to me to get you out.

22:49.125 --> 22:50.708
Turn myself in now,

22:50.708 --> 22:53.250
there's a chance I can get Poppy out, too.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.875
[Poppy and Merimac chuckle]

22:56.875 --> 23:00.833
Been meaning to ask ya,
why is it exactly they call you Nobody?

23:01.458 --> 23:05.541
My folks aren't the most decisive.
Took 'em a long time to settle on a name.

23:05.541 --> 23:06.833
Well, how long?

23:06.833 --> 23:08.416
Well, one or two years.

23:08.416 --> 23:09.625
That's not so long.

23:10.166 --> 23:11.625
One or two years ago.

23:12.958 --> 23:14.666
And by that point, Nobody'd stuck.

23:17.583 --> 23:18.583
[Poppy] Hmm.

23:19.916 --> 23:20.916
[Merimac grunts softly]

23:23.416 --> 23:24.958
Why are you lookin' at me like that?

23:25.583 --> 23:27.833
I was gonna-- I was thinkin' of askin',

23:27.833 --> 23:30.291
what with all of us maybe
about to be murdered and all,

23:30.291 --> 23:31.541
if you wanna go--

23:31.541 --> 23:33.041
Quit talking.

23:37.708 --> 23:39.708
[romantic music playing]

23:53.541 --> 23:55.333
- Merimac.
- Poppy.

23:57.041 --> 23:59.041
Did you have lizard for supper?

23:59.791 --> 24:00.916
Why do you ask?

24:01.416 --> 24:03.416
[playful music playing]

24:06.500 --> 24:07.708
[Poppy] <i>She's right, Nor.</i>

24:08.458 --> 24:11.125
Those big folk are only after us
to get to him, the Stranger.

24:11.833 --> 24:15.041
Turn yourself in, you might well be
puttin' the whole world at risk.

24:15.041 --> 24:17.750
Not just Stoors, but Harfoots too.

24:17.750 --> 24:19.875
Your ma and da. Dilly.

24:22.583 --> 24:24.708
How many times you told me he's important?

24:27.375 --> 24:29.500
Few more'n a rabbit's dozen, I suppose.

24:33.041 --> 24:37.625
Thing is, Nor, sooner or later,
when you say somethin' enough,

24:40.291 --> 24:41.625
I start believin' ya.

24:49.500 --> 24:50.750
I say we fight for it.

24:59.041 --> 25:01.583
The Dark Wizard found his staff.

25:02.541 --> 25:06.250
And now, the time has come
for you to find yours.

25:09.041 --> 25:10.166
[Stranger, panting] Oh!

25:12.750 --> 25:14.166
Which one is it?

25:16.166 --> 25:20.083
[Tom] You'll find your true staff
only when the vision of your heart

25:20.083 --> 25:23.041
is single to the service
of the Secret Fire.

25:23.541 --> 25:24.833
But there are so many.

25:25.583 --> 25:27.541
One could spend months
searching out there.

25:28.375 --> 25:30.125
You have all the time you need.

25:31.208 --> 25:33.833
Unless, there is somewhere else
you wish to be.

25:36.208 --> 25:39.166
I saw her. Nori.

25:40.125 --> 25:41.500
- She was...
- [chuckles softly]

25:41.500 --> 25:45.916
Somehow, I know that
unless I find her soon, she will die.

25:45.916 --> 25:47.208
Both of them will die.

25:48.291 --> 25:50.208
Many that die deserve life.

25:51.125 --> 25:52.958
Some that live deserve death.

25:54.083 --> 25:55.666
Who are you to give it to them?

25:56.541 --> 25:59.458
Once I know that she's safe,
I could return to you.

25:59.458 --> 26:02.250
No. You cannot.

26:04.125 --> 26:09.000
There are times when one path becomes two,
and you must choose.

26:10.750 --> 26:14.833
Turn away now,
and you can never return to this path.

26:15.916 --> 26:17.291
Is there no other way?

26:18.750 --> 26:20.875
Sauron rises in the west.

26:21.375 --> 26:23.291
A Dark Wizard in the east.

26:23.291 --> 26:25.875
Every soul in Middle-earth is in peril.

26:26.625 --> 26:28.833
Will you abandon them to their doom?

26:31.333 --> 26:32.791
She is my friend.

26:34.166 --> 26:37.291
Your friend or your destiny?

26:39.791 --> 26:41.125
The choice is yours.

26:41.875 --> 26:43.875
[dramatic music crescendoes]

26:54.166 --> 26:55.916
- [music dies down]
- [wind whistling]

27:02.375 --> 27:04.375
[Dwarves grunting]

27:06.458 --> 27:09.291
[male Dwarf] Come on,
put your bread into it.

27:09.291 --> 27:11.375
[pickaxes clinking]

27:36.666 --> 27:37.916
[King Durin grunts]

27:38.750 --> 27:39.750
Sire.

28:05.583 --> 28:07.166
You summoned me, Father?

28:09.375 --> 28:10.375
No.

28:11.916 --> 28:13.000
He did.

28:16.958 --> 28:20.375
I see the Seven are serving you well,
Prince Durin.

28:22.791 --> 28:26.375
They're serving someone well.
I'll give you that.

28:26.375 --> 28:28.166
[Annatar] Circumstances have changed.

28:28.166 --> 28:31.541
I have just learned that Eregion
is under threat of invasion.

28:32.250 --> 28:35.875
Without <i>mithril,</i> the remaining
Rings of Power may never be complete.

28:36.708 --> 28:38.041
We need more.

28:39.250 --> 28:40.791
And we need it now.

28:41.541 --> 28:43.125
How much shall I offer you?

28:43.125 --> 28:44.583
There is nothing you could d--

28:44.583 --> 28:46.750
How much of what?

28:48.125 --> 28:51.000
I understand you're expanding
your mining operations.

28:52.583 --> 28:55.791
We can provide a steady supply of timber

28:55.791 --> 28:59.541
to help build platforms, mine shafts.

29:01.041 --> 29:04.208
Or perhaps Khazad-dûm
would prefer something...

29:05.875 --> 29:07.333
more precious?

29:10.958 --> 29:16.500
Father, perhaps we'd be wise
to discuss this first in private?

29:17.291 --> 29:18.750
There's nothing to discuss.

29:20.333 --> 29:21.958
I've already decided.

29:25.291 --> 29:26.291
And?

29:27.625 --> 29:29.000
The answer is no.

29:30.875 --> 29:34.750
Please give my regrets
to Lord Celebrimbor.

29:44.250 --> 29:45.250
King Durin.

29:46.833 --> 29:48.750
Prince. Farewell.

30:00.333 --> 30:01.541
Thank Aulë.

30:03.416 --> 30:07.583
For a moment, I was afraid
you'd taken leave of all your senses.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.000
On the contrary.

30:15.833 --> 30:17.750
I have never been of sounder mind.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.000
But do not worry, my son.

30:21.875 --> 30:22.833
They'll be back.

30:23.458 --> 30:24.458
Back?

30:26.458 --> 30:27.458
You heard him.

30:29.041 --> 30:30.791
War is coming to Middle-earth.

30:31.958 --> 30:37.041
And the army that bears
the weapons and armor of <i>mithril</i>

30:37.041 --> 30:39.083
is all but invincible.

30:39.083 --> 30:42.291
We can name our price. [chuckles]

30:42.291 --> 30:43.750
Have you gone mad?

30:44.833 --> 30:47.375
The whole world's gone mad, my son.

30:49.833 --> 30:53.833
But it is to us to grip it by the throat.

30:55.166 --> 30:59.750
Tell Narvi to double his work teams.
We're expanding the dig.

31:00.583 --> 31:01.583
Father.

31:03.833 --> 31:05.166
Take off the Ring.

31:06.166 --> 31:07.375
I will not.

31:10.208 --> 31:11.291
It is mine.

31:13.000 --> 31:14.125
Belongs to me.

31:15.375 --> 31:16.375
No.

31:18.083 --> 31:19.916
You belong to it.

31:22.125 --> 31:26.708
If it is otherwise, please, prove it.

31:26.708 --> 31:28.791
[unsettling music playing]

31:31.416 --> 31:32.583
[softly] Take it off.

31:37.000 --> 31:39.041
[disembodied whispers]

31:42.666 --> 31:46.291
I have nothing to prove to you, boy.

31:49.166 --> 31:50.208
[grunts softly]

31:52.291 --> 31:54.333
- [ring trills sharply]
- [King Durin grunts]

31:54.333 --> 31:56.375
[Prince Durin IV grunts, groans]

32:07.291 --> 32:09.500
Then he's left us no choice.

32:11.000 --> 32:14.500
We'll lay our bodies in front of that mine
ourselves if we have to.

32:16.125 --> 32:18.208
He'd call the whole army down on us.

32:18.708 --> 32:20.000
Let him!

32:20.541 --> 32:24.333
If he's so in thrall to that Ring,
he'd turn his troops on his own son,

32:24.333 --> 32:28.375
it'll show every Dwarf in Khazad-dûm
he's no longer fit to rule.

32:28.375 --> 32:29.625
They'll take his crown.

32:32.791 --> 32:35.083
How can you talk about him this way?

32:36.250 --> 32:37.500
Durin.

32:37.500 --> 32:39.833
You're talkin' about humiliatin' him.

32:41.208 --> 32:42.541
About destroying him.

32:42.541 --> 32:46.541
I love him as much as you do.

32:47.125 --> 32:50.875
Aulë knows, he's twice the father to me
my own ever was.

32:52.208 --> 32:55.333
But the Dwarf on that throne
is not your father.

32:55.958 --> 33:00.875
As long as he's wearing that Ring,
he's deaf to all other voices, even ours.

33:00.875 --> 33:03.666
And every Dwarf
in this mountain's in peril!

33:05.125 --> 33:06.208
Durin!

33:08.000 --> 33:09.083
Durin?

33:11.333 --> 33:12.791
[Prince Durin IV whimpers]

33:13.083 --> 33:14.833
Durin, are you...

33:15.333 --> 33:17.000
[crying] I can't do it.

33:18.791 --> 33:20.958
I can't do it, Disa.

33:24.250 --> 33:28.583
I look at him, and in his eyes, I...

33:32.583 --> 33:34.250
I still see my father.

33:36.833 --> 33:40.500
Lost and far away, yes,
but he's still in there.

33:44.375 --> 33:48.250
Always have you seen the light
at the end of the cave, my love.

33:49.750 --> 33:50.750
Come.

33:56.666 --> 34:00.916
If we don't act now, we'll never reach it.

34:02.708 --> 34:06.958
He'll destroy himself
and take this kingdom with him.

34:13.250 --> 34:15.250
[horn bellows]

34:18.500 --> 34:21.125
[horn bellows]

34:24.166 --> 34:29.750
At dawn, you are to be cast into the sea
to face Trial by Abyss.

34:30.541 --> 34:32.333
[horn bellows]

34:32.333 --> 34:34.583
They are summoning the sea-worm
as we speak.

34:38.583 --> 34:39.958
I have spoken with Ar-Pharazôn.

34:40.875 --> 34:41.958
He does not wish

34:41.958 --> 34:44.083
- to further antagonize The Faithful.
- [Elendil scoffs]

34:44.083 --> 34:47.833
His offer of mercy still stands,
if you swear--

34:47.833 --> 34:49.583
Swear fealty to him?

34:53.333 --> 34:58.083
It is hardly mercy to ask a man
to set his integrity aflame.

35:03.166 --> 35:06.958
[crying] After everything this family
has lost, I cannot lose you too.

35:08.791 --> 35:10.250
Please, Father.

35:13.791 --> 35:14.958
Please.

35:20.750 --> 35:22.458
Swallow your pride.

35:24.791 --> 35:27.750
If after all this, all you see is pride...

35:33.625 --> 35:36.041
Then there are no words left
for us to speak.

35:48.916 --> 35:50.541
The King said you'd say that.

35:52.666 --> 35:56.666
Said your hatred for him
had become hatred for me,

35:58.083 --> 36:00.375
and forever shut your ears to my voice.

36:03.333 --> 36:05.875
So I knelt before him,

36:07.666 --> 36:08.916
and I begged,

36:08.916 --> 36:12.083
with my tongue to the dust,
for the chance to go to her.

36:15.416 --> 36:17.125
[cell door opens]

36:28.708 --> 36:30.208
I pray I wasn't wrong.

36:31.916 --> 36:33.458
You do not belong in this place.

36:33.458 --> 36:34.750
Bow to Pharazôn.

36:36.125 --> 36:37.375
I command it.

36:38.708 --> 36:41.583
If Númenor is to endure,
it needs men like you.

36:42.750 --> 36:46.000
Men who will champion all
that is precious. Men of faith.

36:47.291 --> 36:50.125
Faith is not faith if it is not lived.

36:52.083 --> 36:56.666
And in my heart, I know
you are this kingdom's true heir.

36:58.166 --> 37:00.000
I cannot deny that knowledge.

37:01.291 --> 37:04.375
Were I to do so, I would cease
to be the man you wish to save.

37:04.375 --> 37:05.791
What if you're wrong?

37:07.291 --> 37:09.833
Then I would rather die
with a heart that is whole,

37:09.833 --> 37:12.000
than live with one broken by cowardice.

37:15.375 --> 37:16.958
What of my heart?

37:16.958 --> 37:19.041
[somber music playing]

37:24.125 --> 37:28.875
If it is the will of the Valar
that my life be spared...

37:32.166 --> 37:33.583
then it will be.

37:39.125 --> 37:40.541
[voice breaking] What if it isn't?

37:50.916 --> 37:53.125
[Elendil] "The sea is always right."

38:16.583 --> 38:17.583
[male Dwarf] Step!

38:28.166 --> 38:29.250
Disa?

38:37.875 --> 38:41.250
Disa, we're here on orders from the king.

38:41.250 --> 38:42.541
So, please move,

38:43.458 --> 38:46.625
otherwise I've no choice
but to see you moved.

38:52.833 --> 38:53.916
I'm sorry.

38:56.791 --> 39:00.416
[vocalizes]

39:01.291 --> 39:06.333
[vocalizes]

39:09.916 --> 39:13.208
- Was that meant to frighten us off?
- [Dwarves chuckle]

39:13.875 --> 39:14.875
No.

39:16.041 --> 39:17.125
They are.

39:20.041 --> 39:22.000
[chittering, screeching]

39:24.250 --> 39:26.375
[bats chitter, screech]

39:28.875 --> 39:30.791
[Dwarves grunt, scream]

39:47.666 --> 39:49.208
I love you.

39:50.333 --> 39:51.625
Love me later.

39:54.666 --> 39:56.166
This is only the beginning.

39:57.041 --> 39:59.916
They'll be back.
And there'll be more of them.

40:02.333 --> 40:03.666
Then, we'll be ready.

40:04.458 --> 40:06.458
[horns bellow]

40:35.666 --> 40:41.250
Do you forsake all earthly authority
and accept the judgment of the Valar?

40:46.500 --> 40:48.250
I accept their judgment.

40:50.291 --> 40:51.458
Throw him in.

41:13.333 --> 41:15.041
[waves crashing]

41:15.041 --> 41:16.333
[woman] Release him!

41:17.791 --> 41:19.833
[people clamor]

41:20.791 --> 41:23.375
Given that his crime
was committed in my name,

41:25.333 --> 41:28.541
I have the right to face
the Valar's judgment in his place.

41:33.500 --> 41:36.833
- It should be him. Take him.
- [woman] No, no. No!

41:38.125 --> 41:39.125
My Queen?

41:41.916 --> 41:44.750
She's correct.
It's all in there. You must.

41:45.666 --> 41:46.750
Is this true?

41:48.125 --> 41:49.625
By the letter of the law, yes.

41:51.666 --> 41:52.916
So it shall be.

41:55.083 --> 41:56.833
No, take me.

41:57.833 --> 41:59.208
Take me.

41:59.750 --> 42:00.916
[speaking Quenya]

42:00.916 --> 42:02.625
[in English] Míriel, you can't--
You cannot--

42:02.625 --> 42:05.541
If we are to walk the path
of The Faithful,

42:07.375 --> 42:09.791
it must be me who takes the first step.

43:06.750 --> 43:09.416
- [woman 1] It's here! Look!
- [man 1] Over the horizon.

43:09.416 --> 43:10.708
[man 2] Yeah, it's coming now.

43:34.708 --> 43:36.708
[breathing heavily]

43:42.333 --> 43:43.625
[people clamoring]

43:45.250 --> 43:47.250
[unsettling music playing]

44:13.375 --> 44:14.875
[roaring]

44:31.875 --> 44:34.666
The Valar have deemed her...

44:42.750 --> 44:44.250
- [woman] There she is!
- Innocent!

44:44.250 --> 44:46.125
[people cheering]

44:46.125 --> 44:47.208
My Queen!

44:54.333 --> 45:00.083
Hail Tar-Míriel, Queen of the Sea!

45:00.083 --> 45:03.125
[people chanting]

45:09.291 --> 45:12.666
- Hail Queen Míriel.
- Hail Queen of the Sea.

45:13.625 --> 45:15.541
Hail Queen Míriel.

45:15.541 --> 45:17.833
[chanting continues]

45:24.708 --> 45:26.708
[dramatic music playing]

45:44.666 --> 45:45.666
[grunts]

45:48.250 --> 45:50.500
[panting]

45:52.791 --> 45:55.541
[Galadriel] <i>Yes. Halbrand is Sauron.</i>

45:55.541 --> 45:59.333
He's in Eregion to craft Rings
that will allow him to dominate my kind.

46:00.208 --> 46:02.625
- And yours.
- Every kind in Middle-earth.

46:02.625 --> 46:05.375
But he will not attempt escape
until his task is complete.

46:06.583 --> 46:10.458
And that gives us a momentary advantage.

46:11.083 --> 46:12.000
Us?

46:13.416 --> 46:14.666
[chains rattle]

46:15.250 --> 46:16.333
Unlock me.

46:37.875 --> 46:43.458
As we speak, Elrond hastens from Lindon
with an army of Elves.

46:46.083 --> 46:49.416
And Nenya, my Ring.

46:51.666 --> 46:52.666
I see.

46:53.250 --> 46:56.833
Once he arrives,
he will seal off the city,

46:56.833 --> 47:00.333
loose Celebrimbor from Sauron's grasp,
and then together,

47:01.583 --> 47:02.500
<i>Uruk,</i>

47:04.625 --> 47:08.083
you and I will eradicate
all trace of Sauron from this world.

47:09.000 --> 47:10.375
Never to return.

47:11.083 --> 47:12.291
And what then?

47:13.083 --> 47:15.833
Any Rings that have known his touch
must be destroyed.

47:16.333 --> 47:18.625
I meant, what then for the <i>Uruk?</i>

47:20.208 --> 47:23.250
Will your High King permit us
to return home in peace?

47:24.500 --> 47:27.500
Or will he proceed with his plans
to invade Mordor?

47:29.375 --> 47:33.625
The shadow has not only overcome you,
it has overcome all Elvendom.

47:34.250 --> 47:35.250
In the end,

47:35.250 --> 47:39.708
your drive to prove your virtue will work
right into Sauron's designs.

47:40.875 --> 47:42.291
You speak lies.

47:43.291 --> 47:45.083
Hoping I will reveal something.

47:45.750 --> 47:47.791
You have already revealed

47:47.791 --> 47:52.000
everything I hoped you would and more.

47:58.291 --> 48:00.291
- [indistinct clamor]
- [tools clanging]

48:04.208 --> 48:05.458
[Orc] All right, all right.

48:07.333 --> 48:08.750
[in Black Speech] It is time!

48:11.333 --> 48:14.541
[in English] All of Eregion may well be
under Sauron's control by now.

48:16.125 --> 48:19.833
It will take far more than a legion
of your children to lay siege to it.

48:19.833 --> 48:23.958
Did you really think I would attempt
to challenge the might of Sauron

48:23.958 --> 48:25.583
with a single legion?

48:29.916 --> 48:31.916
[dramatic music playing]

48:45.541 --> 48:48.708
Now that you have confirmed
beyond any doubt who he is,

48:49.708 --> 48:51.708
and told me who carries your Ring,

48:53.416 --> 48:55.125
Eregion will fall.

48:56.250 --> 48:57.750
And Sauron with it.

48:58.916 --> 48:59.916
No.

49:02.833 --> 49:04.583
This must be what he wants.

49:07.166 --> 49:09.291
Sauron has no army of his own,

49:10.666 --> 49:12.875
so he's lured yours here instead.

49:14.916 --> 49:17.041
He wants you to attack Eregion.

49:17.041 --> 49:19.666
Bind her. She will be useful later.

49:20.750 --> 49:24.166
- I beg you. Do not be a fool.
- [Orc] Get down here.

49:24.166 --> 49:26.500
Do not do this. Do not take his lure.

49:26.500 --> 49:28.166
I will make him choke on it.

49:29.000 --> 49:30.000
No!

49:31.041 --> 49:34.083
You mustn't. This is all his design!

49:35.083 --> 49:36.666
This is what Sauron wants!

49:37.500 --> 49:39.000
This is what he wants!

49:39.791 --> 49:41.416
[Orc] This way. Come on.

49:51.458 --> 49:53.750
[bellows]

49:53.750 --> 49:55.875
[Orcs clamor]

49:58.125 --> 50:00.125
[sinister music playing]

50:05.833 --> 50:06.833
[snarls]

50:11.708 --> 50:12.791
[Orcs grunting]

50:12.791 --> 50:14.875
[Orc 1] Push! Move!

50:16.416 --> 50:17.458
[Orc 2] Harder!

50:25.375 --> 50:27.375
[sinister music continues]

50:28.875 --> 50:30.125
[Commander Malendol]
Sound the bells.

50:31.166 --> 50:32.375
We're under attack!

50:32.500 --> 50:34.833
- [bells tolling]
- [Annatar] Shut the gates!

50:34.833 --> 50:36.000
Raise the drawbridge!

50:36.000 --> 50:37.500
- [people clamoring in fear]
- [grunts]

51:01.125 --> 51:04.500
- [people screaming distantly]
- [alarm bells tolling distantly]

51:18.250 --> 51:19.708
How fares your progress?

51:21.500 --> 51:22.833
Did you not hear that?

51:23.833 --> 51:26.500
Outside. Sounded like a siege alarm.

51:27.291 --> 51:30.208
I assure you, I have the affairs
of the city well in hand.

51:31.958 --> 51:33.791
I shall decide that for myself.

51:36.333 --> 51:37.833
You belong in here, my friend.

51:39.125 --> 51:41.833
I've had quite enough
of you telling me where I belong!

51:51.625 --> 51:54.291
Unhand me, friend.

52:00.166 --> 52:01.958
Leave this tower now,

52:01.958 --> 52:04.375
and when the Men of Middle-earth fall,
I swear to you,

52:04.375 --> 52:06.833
every soul in the seen or unseen world

52:06.833 --> 52:10.166
will know that it was you
who was the architect of their demise.

52:10.166 --> 52:12.166
We still have nine Rings to forge!

52:18.166 --> 52:20.166
[disembodied voices whispering]

52:27.291 --> 52:28.291
[gasps sharply]

52:28.291 --> 52:30.416
[children laughing]

52:42.958 --> 52:44.958
[sighs with relief]

52:44.958 --> 52:47.666
[lilting music playing]

53:04.708 --> 53:07.625
[inaudible]

53:07.625 --> 53:10.333
- Sure.
- It's a horse.

53:13.291 --> 53:14.625
[Annatar] For centuries,

53:16.125 --> 53:18.833
I sought to craft objects of great power.

53:21.208 --> 53:22.166
But I failed.

53:22.791 --> 53:24.125
The truth of it is,

53:25.208 --> 53:28.208
I came to Eregion
not because the Valar needed you,

53:30.541 --> 53:31.708
but because I did.

53:33.666 --> 53:34.666
I... [sighs]

53:41.750 --> 53:44.000
I cannot forge more Rings.

53:47.791 --> 53:49.583
And without <i>mithril,</i> I...

53:52.375 --> 53:53.625
Be at ease.

53:55.125 --> 53:56.750
I have been to Khazad-dûm.

54:01.375 --> 54:02.791
<i>Mithril</i> ore.

54:04.583 --> 54:07.125
Refined to a powder by Narvi himself.

54:09.166 --> 54:11.250
From the purest deposit yet found
in their mines.

54:11.250 --> 54:13.666
One-ninth portion per Ring.

54:15.041 --> 54:16.375
It should be enough.

54:19.916 --> 54:22.291
We are close, now, Celebrimbor.

54:24.166 --> 54:26.375
So close to achieving
what we set out to do.

54:28.125 --> 54:31.500
I give you my oath,
upon my immortal being,

54:32.250 --> 54:35.916
when the history of this Age is written,
the Silmarils,

54:37.458 --> 54:38.458
well...

54:42.375 --> 54:44.750
They will merit little more
than a whisper.

54:47.458 --> 54:49.166
But your Rings,

54:51.166 --> 54:52.750
the Rings of Power,

54:54.791 --> 55:00.500
they will be deemed the most
precious creations in all Middle-earth.

55:01.750 --> 55:02.958
Yeah.

55:02.958 --> 55:07.375
Do not turn back now, at the very moment
your boots are kissing the threshold.

55:12.541 --> 55:15.291
Use it, my friend.

55:17.416 --> 55:18.416
Best Fëanor.

55:20.458 --> 55:21.458
Best yourself.

55:26.333 --> 55:31.375
One last time.

55:59.166 --> 56:01.041
[man] I've written a poem
but I fear your beauty

56:01.041 --> 56:03.958
still overshadows
anything I could possible write.

56:08.541 --> 56:10.083
[whooshing]

56:10.083 --> 56:13.000
- [people screaming]
- [sinister music playing]

56:19.166 --> 56:20.875
[woman shouting indistinctly]

56:22.500 --> 56:23.583
Come, children!

57:01.125 --> 57:03.125
[sinister music continues]

57:30.500 --> 57:31.750
Yeah!

57:57.416 --> 57:58.416
[Orc 2] Release!

58:15.708 --> 58:16.708
[music crescendoes, fades]

58:19.375 --> 58:21.375
[closing theme music playing]
