[shouting] Shit!

00:47.630 --> 00:50.505
-What the fuck was that, Doctor?
-I think you know.

00:50.755 --> 00:53.088
I wanna hear <i>you </i>fuckin' say it, 
Mr Science.

00:53.172 --> 00:54.713
Wait!  

00:54.797 --> 00:55.713
Ugh!  

00:59.547 --> 01:02.005
Tell me, Doctor,
is that as fast as you can run?

01:02.088 --> 01:03.547
I'm afraid so, Mr. Flynn.

01:03.630 --> 01:04.880
Good, it'll catch you first

01:04.963 --> 01:07.422
and I'll be able to get out of here
while it's eating you.

[shouting] Oh, shit!  

01:30.880 --> 01:32.922
[Mr. Flynn] Is that what 
we're looking for, Doctor?

01:36.130 --> 01:38.213
I think it might be, Mr. Flynn.

01:38.963 --> 01:41.422
Do try to at least <i>act </i>excited.

01:42.297 --> 01:44.547
[Mr. Flynn] Mercenaries are 
like hookers, Doctor:

01:45.047 --> 01:47.422
pretending to be excited costs extra.

01:50.713 --> 01:52.880
Simon, here's a test for you.

02:03.880 --> 02:04.880
Can you translate?

02:04.963 --> 02:06.880
Hmm, let me see.

I'm freezing my tits off back here.

[sniffs]

02:32.672 --> 02:34.505
I'll be sure to relay that message, Micky.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.547
[Doctor] Mr. Flynn, this is definitely it.

02:36.630 --> 02:39.088
I will need the rest of
the equipment, ASAP.

Micky, Gary, get the weapons ready.
We're coming in hot.

04:47.713 --> 04:49.880
[laughs] Are those boffins trying
to grab your bum again?

04:49.963 --> 04:52.630
[in English accent] Yeah, 
I saw that little one eyeing ya.

05:15.672 --> 05:19.047
It's him, the Impaler. Dracula!

05:20.297 --> 05:22.422
I did not think we would find him alive.

05:22.505 --> 05:23.713
Well, of course you didn't.

05:24.130 --> 05:26.172
And isn't this a fine fucking mess?

What'd he say, Doc?

05:56.422 --> 05:58.255
He said you're a warrior.

05:58.338 --> 06:00.338
God damn right I'm a warrior.

06:02.755 --> 06:05.588
Yes,but he also added that
he's looking forward

06:05.672 --> 06:07.422

06:26.422 --> 06:28.338
-He hates cats.
-What?

06:28.588 --> 06:31.963
[Doctor] The legend has it that 
feeding on them makes his flesh burn.

06:32.297 --> 06:36.255
The locals would torment him by
bringing hundreds of cats to the fortress.

in trouble for eatin' a little pussy.

06:51.797 --> 06:53.547
Do you think something held them up?

saved our lives.

07:19.505 --> 07:22.130
Yeah, I know it saved <i>my </i>life a few times.

07:22.505 --> 07:23.755
Cut the shit, Gary.

07:23.838 --> 07:27.547
There's a fucking monster out there,
and it was gonna eat our asses.

07:27.630 --> 07:30.130
Something was gonna eat your ass?

07:30.630 --> 07:33.213
[sarcastic] Now that's 
a gutsy fashion statement.

07:33.588 --> 07:35.588
Is that real Korean grad student?

07:35.672 --> 07:37.672
-God damn it, Gary.
-[crying] Oh, no...

07:37.755 --> 07:39.130
Upsy-daisy, fella.

07:39.797 --> 07:43.297
Stop with all the yodeling
and tell them what's behind that door.

07:43.380 --> 07:46.588
Because that <i>thing </i>is between us
and the only way out.

07:47.672 --> 07:49.172
It is the Impaler.

07:49.255 --> 07:50.672
Isn't that a type of car?

07:50.755 --> 07:53.005
That's an Impala, you stupid cunt.

07:53.088 --> 07:54.380
Oh, right.

07:54.463 --> 07:57.338
So there's a Dracula out there, then?

07:57.422 --> 07:59.422
Not <i>a </i>Dracula.

07:59.797 --> 08:01.422
<i>The </i>Dracula.

08:01.505 --> 08:03.172
Are you serious?

08:03.255 --> 08:05.755
Fuck right off, you weird little man.

08:05.838 --> 08:08.963
It's true.
He ate the tiny research assistant.

08:09.463 --> 08:12.463
Anyway, what's the state of play
with our ordinance, Gary?

08:12.547 --> 08:14.797
Not particularly tickity, to be honest.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.630
Weren't expecting gunfights
with angry vampires.

08:17.713 --> 08:21.672
We've got two boxes of ammo for the P90s,
four magazines for the sidearms,

08:21.755 --> 08:25.755
shotgun, couple of old battle maces,
bottle of 2000-year-old wine

08:25.838 --> 08:28.922
and I've got a smidge of C4, if it helps.

08:29.255 --> 08:31.963
Why? Why do you have C4, Gary?

08:32.297 --> 08:33.213
Uhhh...

08:33.338 --> 08:35.505
-Cave-ins?
-[Doctor] It's not enough.

08:35.588 --> 08:38.672
-What?
-I said, it's not enough.

08:39.047 --> 08:41.672
You're not dealing with
Taliban terrorists here.

08:41.755 --> 08:46.838
You're dealing with an ancient evil
that defeats whole armies

08:46.922 --> 08:48.963
and feasts on their entrails.

08:49.047 --> 08:51.630
-Not helping, Doctor.
-[loud pounding]

08:52.838 --> 08:54.755
-How big is this fucker?
-[loud pounding]

08:54.838 --> 08:56.713
-Where's the fucking cat?
-[cat meows]

08:56.797 --> 08:59.630
-There's the cats, fucking.
-Oh, come on!

08:59.713 --> 09:02.797
You got suggestions, Doctor,
now's the time to make 'em.

09:03.713 --> 09:06.505
I'm an archaeologist,
Mr. Flynn, not a tactician.

09:06.588 --> 09:09.630
Well, I'm an ex-soldier,
not Buffy the fucking Vampire Slayer,

09:09.713 --> 09:11.380
but you don't see me crying in a corner.

09:11.463 --> 09:13.380
-[loud pounding]
-Now think, damn it!

09:13.463 --> 09:15.755
[frantic music plays]

09:15.838 --> 09:18.338
This place was built to withstand siege.

09:18.422 --> 09:20.005
There must be other exits.

09:21.463 --> 09:23.047
I think I may have something.

09:23.130 --> 09:25.380
The map marked another egress point.

09:30.547 --> 09:32.422
Secret door! Beautiful.

09:37.963 --> 09:39.005
Yes, Gary?

09:39.088 --> 09:42.213
-About that C4...
-Do it.

09:42.297 --> 09:43.130
[laughs]

09:43.213 --> 09:45.588
[Mr. Flynn] Just don't bring

What? Better too much than too little.

11:09.255 --> 11:10.338
[Mr. Flynn grunts]

11:11.797 --> 11:14.047
Where did you say this tunnel led to?

11:14.297 --> 11:15.672
More prison cells.

11:16.047 --> 11:17.922
Probably cells for more...
