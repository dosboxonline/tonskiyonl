WEBVTT

02:25.646 --> 02:27.648
(police siren wails)

02:34.029 --> 02:36.198
-Hi, hon!
-Hey.

02:36.282 --> 02:38.117
Thank you.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.994
-This is it then.
-Hmm.

02:40.077 --> 02:42.663
-Nervous?
-A bit.

02:42.746 --> 02:43.956
You'll be all right.

02:44.039 --> 02:46.166
First in every morning,
last out.

02:46.250 --> 02:47.626
How are my panda eyes?

02:48.752 --> 02:51.422
They're fine. Bad night?

02:51.505 --> 02:55.384
Er, no, this is actually me
after a good night's sleep.

02:56.343 --> 03:00.806
I value each and every member
of my team

03:00.890 --> 03:02.391
and I let head office know this.

03:02.474 --> 03:05.603
But the new management have
pushed for a list of six of you

03:05.686 --> 03:07.396
for the Super Team.

03:07.479 --> 03:11.609
So, the names I've put forward
are Brodie...

03:11.692 --> 03:13.152
-Jamie.
-(man) Yes!

03:13.235 --> 03:14.612
-Laura.
-(woman) Brilliant!

03:14.695 --> 03:16.238
-Andy.
-Right!

03:16.322 --> 03:17.698
-Daniel.
-Yeah!

03:17.781 --> 03:18.824
And, er...

03:20.200 --> 03:21.911
-Kirsty.
-Oh.

03:21.994 --> 03:23.787
So congratulations
to those six.

03:23.871 --> 03:25.831
Let's have a few minutes
to digest everything

03:25.915 --> 03:27.291
and then back to work.

03:29.335 --> 03:31.045
I can't believe it.

03:31.921 --> 03:33.172
-Not now.
-Yeah.

03:33.255 --> 03:34.798
-No.
-Yeah, now.

03:35.966 --> 03:38.802
(woman) Kirsty? She hasn't
been here five minutes!

03:38.886 --> 03:41.889
(manager) I think you're very
competent and valued, Philippa.

03:41.972 --> 03:44.183
But after careful consideration,
I have decided

03:44.266 --> 03:46.560
that you are at the right level
for you.

03:46.644 --> 03:48.729
Are you actually reading
from an HR manual?

03:48.812 --> 03:50.439
No, no.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.942
Look, we both know
you've had issues.

03:54.193 --> 03:57.863
ME isn't skiving. I suffer
from chronic fatigue, Tony.

03:57.947 --> 03:59.281
It's a real illness.

03:59.365 --> 04:01.116
And yet have I ever missed
a deadline?

04:01.200 --> 04:03.160
I thought it was time to give
the younger ones

04:03.243 --> 04:04.244
a chance to shine.

04:04.328 --> 04:06.789
Well, if you want people
who are good at being under 40,

04:06.872 --> 04:09.124
I will admit
I am  struggling there.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.335
But so are you.

04:11.418 --> 04:13.963
Hair wax isn't fooling anyone.

04:14.046 --> 04:15.756
It's clay, actually.

04:24.306 --> 04:26.517
I can't face it.

04:28.435 --> 04:30.354
What would improve things
for you?

04:31.563 --> 04:33.565
A penis.

04:33.649 --> 04:37.236
Well, you can have mine.
It's not very busy these days.

04:37.319 --> 04:39.655
Trying to make me laugh
isn't helping much, John.

04:40.781 --> 04:44.076
I just keep getting horrible
flashbacks to when I was ill.

04:44.159 --> 04:46.704
Yeah, don't do anything
impetuous. That's all I ask.

04:46.787 --> 04:50.457
We have two households to run
and we need your wages too.

04:50.541 --> 04:51.917
(Philippa) Boys!

04:55.587 --> 04:57.589
Wait a minute,
are you not eating with us too?

04:57.673 --> 05:01.218
No. I'm, er, going out
for dinner with a woman.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.636
Tomato sauce and salad.

05:02.720 --> 05:04.471
Yes, I met her
on Plenty of Fish.

05:04.555 --> 05:06.140
No, I don't know much about her.

05:06.223 --> 05:07.683
John, please,
can't you rearrange?

05:07.766 --> 05:10.352
I can't face having to go
to this play tonight.

05:10.436 --> 05:12.271
Not on my own.
Boys, come on now!

05:12.354 --> 05:14.356
Yes, I could,
but I'm not going to.

05:14.440 --> 05:16.483
And one day,
you'll thank me for it.

05:16.567 --> 05:20.529
Oh. You wearing that jacket,
are you?

05:20.612 --> 05:22.156
Yes, I am.

05:24.408 --> 05:25.993
Good luck, Biggles.

05:28.537 --> 05:31.165
-My guy's going down.
-My blues are terrible.

05:31.248 --> 05:33.834
-(Philippa) Boys!
-Deploy my troops!

05:34.501 --> 05:35.836
Dinner is served.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.674
-Mum, what are you doing?
-Mum?

05:40.758 --> 05:42.801
-What are you doing?
-You're not listening to me.

05:42.885 --> 05:44.178
You're coming to the theatre.

05:44.261 --> 05:45.763
You're going round
your grandma's.

05:45.846 --> 05:48.390
Come on. Max, it's not me
that has to write that essay.

05:48.474 --> 05:49.558
-Quicker.
-Crazy woman.

05:49.641 --> 05:51.935
-Er, thank you! I wonder why.
-You're a crazy woman.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.480
Don't copy your brother, Raife.

05:55.397 --> 05:59.568
(man) Now is the winter
of our discontent

05:59.651 --> 06:03.697
made glorious summer
by this son of York.

06:03.781 --> 06:07.743
And all the clouds that
lour'd upon our house

06:07.826 --> 06:11.038
in the deep bosom
of the ocean buried.

06:11.872 --> 06:16.251
But I, that am rudely stamp'd,

06:16.335 --> 06:19.129
and want love's majesty,

06:19.213 --> 06:23.092
I, that am curtail'd
of this fair proportion,

06:24.760 --> 06:28.764
cheated of feature
by dissembling nature,

06:29.765 --> 06:32.434
deformed, unfinish'd,

06:32.518 --> 06:35.312
sent before my time
into this breathing world,

06:35.395 --> 06:37.022
scarce half made up,

06:37.106 --> 06:39.900
and that so lamely
and unfashionable

06:39.983 --> 06:43.612
that dogs bark at me
as I halt by them,

06:44.988 --> 06:46.990
why, I...

06:48.867 --> 06:52.830
in this weak piping time
of peace...

06:54.414 --> 06:57.417
have no delight
to pass away the time,

06:58.710 --> 07:02.339
unless to spy my shadow
in the sun

07:02.422 --> 07:05.551
and descant
on mine own deformity.

07:07.636 --> 07:11.265
Therefore, since I cannot
prove a lover,

07:12.516 --> 07:15.978
I am determined
to prove a villain.

07:22.025 --> 07:24.027
(chatter)

07:24.987 --> 07:26.905
Can we just stay here,
please?

07:26.989 --> 07:29.533
Look, I know it's tough when
you start a new school, Max,

07:29.616 --> 07:31.451
but you've got to make
an effort, darling.

07:31.535 --> 07:33.704
Just talk about the play, yeah?
Come on.

07:35.622 --> 07:38.709
Hello. I'm Philippa, Max's mum.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.169
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

07:40.252 --> 07:41.920
-Alex, Lucy's father.
-How do you do?

07:42.004 --> 07:43.589
-Hey.
-And this is my wife, Susan.

07:43.672 --> 07:44.673
-Hello.
-Hi.

07:44.756 --> 07:46.633
-(Philippa) Hi.
-We were just trying to tot up

07:46.717 --> 07:48.635
how many more the wicked
bugger's got to murder

07:48.719 --> 07:50.804
before he gets his sticky mitts
on the crown.

07:50.888 --> 07:52.431
I actually felt quite sorry
for him.

07:52.514 --> 07:54.808
-Because of his hump?
-Oh, no.

07:54.892 --> 07:57.352
It was, erm, all that stuff
about him feeling so ugly,

07:57.436 --> 07:59.646
he couldn't look at himself
in the mirror.

07:59.730 --> 08:02.065
Still, it's not real, is it?
It's just a play.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.151
Yeah,
but it's a historical play.

08:04.234 --> 08:07.237
Shakespeare was writing about
what was to him recent history.

08:07.321 --> 08:08.655
Well, I just don't believe

08:08.739 --> 08:10.991
someone would be that wicked
because of a disability.

08:11.074 --> 08:12.701
Doesn't ring true to me.

08:12.784 --> 08:15.412
And that's your critique
of Shakespeare, is it?

08:15.495 --> 08:16.496
"Doesn't ring true"?

08:16.580 --> 08:18.123
(bell rings)

08:18.207 --> 08:20.709
Well, see how you feel about him

08:20.792 --> 08:22.419
after he murders
his two little nephews

08:22.502 --> 08:24.630
in the second half. (chuckles)

08:24.713 --> 08:27.591
I wish the bastards dead

08:27.674 --> 08:31.762
and I would have it
suddenly perform'd.

08:31.845 --> 08:36.308
What sayest thou?
Speak suddenly, be brief.

08:36.391 --> 08:38.810
Your Grace
may do your pleasure.

08:38.894 --> 08:39.895
(Richard) Hmm.

08:39.978 --> 08:43.148
(Buckingham) Be happy then,
for it is done, my lord.

08:43.232 --> 08:45.150
(snores)

08:47.569 --> 08:51.031
I think there be six Richmonds
in the field.

08:51.114 --> 08:54.034
Five have I slain today
instead of him.

08:54.117 --> 08:55.869
(swords unsheathe)

08:55.953 --> 08:58.580
A horse! A horse!

08:58.664 --> 09:00.832
My kingdom for a horse!

09:00.916 --> 09:02.876
(groans)

09:13.553 --> 09:17.849
God and your arms be praised,
victorious friends.

09:17.933 --> 09:20.227
The day is ours.

09:20.310 --> 09:23.021
The bloody dog is dead.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.358
(car horn)

09:27.401 --> 09:29.528
(Susan) Sorry. Excuse us.
Come on, Lucy!

09:31.780 --> 09:33.824
Mum, what are you doing? Mum!

09:37.786 --> 09:38.954
Hello, Philippa.

09:39.037 --> 09:42.291
Richard III died in 1485.

09:43.208 --> 09:46.545
Shakespeare didn't write
his play until around 1593.

09:46.628 --> 09:48.463
Sorry, I'm not following you.

09:48.547 --> 09:51.091
You said Shakespeare was
writing about recent history.

09:51.174 --> 09:53.468
He wasn't. He wrote it
over a hundred years

09:53.552 --> 09:55.345
after Richard's death.

09:56.305 --> 09:57.306
All right.

09:57.389 --> 09:58.890
And they reckon
he probably made it up

09:58.974 --> 10:00.309
that he was a hunchback.

10:01.560 --> 10:02.978
But it's just a play, isn't it?

10:03.979 --> 10:05.105
That's what I said.

10:08.025 --> 10:10.110
OK. Bye.

10:14.364 --> 10:15.824
Max, come on.

10:17.993 --> 10:19.077
I just don't like it

10:19.161 --> 10:21.413
when people put others
down for no reason.

10:22.956 --> 10:25.292
So, your dad's got
a new girlfriend then?

10:25.375 --> 10:27.502
(Max) Her name's Sarah
and she likes seafood,

10:27.586 --> 10:29.463
so Dad's taking her
to a fish restaurant.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.423
(Philippa) He'll have the steak.

10:39.890 --> 10:42.309
If it's a call,
introduce yourself.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.728
If it's a man,
I talk about the footy.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.647
But throughout all
your conversations, remember,

10:47.731 --> 10:50.400
put on a happy face, and smile.

10:50.484 --> 10:52.069
It's on the phone, Tony.

10:53.528 --> 10:56.573
Well, your voice
can still have a smile in it.

10:56.656 --> 10:58.492
"Hello. And how are you today?"

10:58.575 --> 11:00.660
Thank you, Kirsty. Yes.

11:00.744 --> 11:03.622
You don't have to see a smile
to know that it's there.

11:03.705 --> 11:06.500
Very important.
Please, continue.

11:06.583 --> 11:09.920
(Kirsty) If it's a new client,
say something to disarm them.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.255
"Sorry, I've been
a bit hectic today."

11:12.339 --> 11:14.299
Or if it's towards
the end of the week,

11:14.383 --> 11:17.010
tell them about how much
you're looking forward to...

11:17.094 --> 11:18.762
(voice fades)

11:29.523 --> 11:30.524
(gasps)

11:46.289 --> 11:48.708
(Kirsty)
If they're an existing client,

11:48.792 --> 11:52.421
do make sure that you
offer them new opportunities

11:52.504 --> 11:55.048
or alternative campaign
strategies.

11:55.132 --> 11:57.467
(Tony) That's good, but you
don't want to get trapped.

11:57.551 --> 11:59.886
So, what you need is an...

11:59.970 --> 12:03.557
exit strategy.

12:23.326 --> 12:25.328
(sighs)

12:25.495 --> 12:26.830
(gasps)

12:54.065 --> 12:55.358
(engine runs)

12:55.442 --> 12:57.360
-Come on. Quick, quick, quick.
-Morning, boys.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.446
-Quick, quick, quicker.
-Quick as you like.

12:59.529 --> 13:00.864
-Gym bag.
-(Max) Thank you.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.116
OK, mind your head.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.535
Don't let the bastards
grind you down.

13:05.619 --> 13:06.620
-Thanks.
-Bye, Mum.

13:06.703 --> 13:07.954
-Bye, Mum.
-Bye.

13:38.610 --> 13:42.531
Hi, erm, do you have any books
on Richard III?

13:43.406 --> 13:45.575
-The king?
-I know who you mean.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.247
Historical books,
not Shakespeare, please.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.415
(keyboard clicks)

13:52.499 --> 13:54.918
We have eight titles.

13:55.001 --> 13:57.796
Yes, please. I'll take them.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.297
Which ones?

14:01.174 --> 14:02.592
All of them.

14:31.121 --> 14:32.581
(man) Thank you.

15:27.594 --> 15:29.220
(Philippa) Look, I...

15:29.304 --> 15:32.182
I know you're some sort
of apparition, so...

15:33.933 --> 15:36.478
you can just go away
and leave me alone.

15:36.561 --> 15:37.979
Please.

15:41.566 --> 15:43.109
This is private property.

15:56.247 --> 15:58.291
(Philippa)
What is it you're going to see?

15:58.375 --> 16:01.211
-Skyfall.  James Bond.
-Oh.

16:01.294 --> 16:02.545
-Mum?
-Yes, darling?

16:02.629 --> 16:04.673
Can you actually get
a licence to kill?

16:04.756 --> 16:06.091
Max says you can.

16:06.174 --> 16:08.593
You just get a form from the
post office and apply for it.

16:08.677 --> 16:10.679
-Like a driving licence.
-You can't, can you, Mum?

16:10.762 --> 16:12.722
-No, he's being daft.
-They only cost 15 quid.

16:12.806 --> 16:13.807
Max!

16:13.890 --> 16:15.475
(John)
You sure you don't wanna come?

16:15.558 --> 16:17.310
No. I'm gonna put my feet up.

16:18.353 --> 16:19.479
Enjoy the film.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.023
-See you later.
-Bye, Mum.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.566
Bye, boys.

17:00.478 --> 17:04.107
(woman) They love to paint him
as some kind of monster,

17:04.190 --> 17:06.568
devoid of compassion and pity.

17:07.527 --> 17:10.321
But I read
a contemporary article

17:10.405 --> 17:12.407
from the Croyland Chronicle
the other day...

17:12.490 --> 17:13.783
Ah, the Croyland.

17:13.867 --> 17:17.287
That noted
and oft-quoted medieval organ.

17:17.370 --> 17:21.207
(woman) ...about when
King Richard lost his only son.

17:23.376 --> 17:26.296
"On hearing the news
of his death at Nottingham,

17:26.379 --> 17:28.173
where they were then residing,

17:28.256 --> 17:30.842
you might have seen
his father and mother

17:30.925 --> 17:34.179
in a state almost bordering
on madness

17:34.262 --> 17:36.848
by reason
of their sudden grief."

17:38.391 --> 17:40.268
And then, a few months later,

17:40.351 --> 17:42.687
his own wife dies
of tuberculosis.

17:42.771 --> 17:45.940
Poor man.
Must've been heartbroken.

17:46.024 --> 17:48.234
Doesn't sound much like
Shakespeare's villain.

17:48.318 --> 17:51.112
Thank you. And this is just
the circumstantial stuff.

17:51.196 --> 17:53.239
We have facts.
We have hard evidence

17:53.323 --> 17:54.616
to refute every accusation

17:54.699 --> 17:56.618
that Richard's detractors
would put to us.

17:56.701 --> 17:57.952
If we ever get the opportunity.

17:58.036 --> 17:59.871
Exactly! But we're shouting
into the void

17:59.954 --> 18:02.248
-and nobody's listening.
-(man) Oh, shut up.

18:02.332 --> 18:03.666
Thank you.

18:04.751 --> 18:08.379
Because Shakespeare's play is
more attractive than the truth.

18:08.463 --> 18:10.423
I'm sorry, my name's Philippa.

18:10.507 --> 18:12.425
You must be
the Richard III Society.

18:12.509 --> 18:13.551
(man) Correct!

18:13.635 --> 18:16.679
Brackets, Edinburgh branch,
close brackets.

18:16.763 --> 18:19.808
At your... disposal.

18:19.891 --> 18:21.226
(chuckles)

18:22.101 --> 18:24.938
(dramatic music, gunfire)

18:25.021 --> 18:28.149
(helicopter rotors whir)

18:33.029 --> 18:36.032
There's so many people who seem
to take such a dim view of him.

18:36.115 --> 18:37.659
They do indeed.

18:37.742 --> 18:39.536
Well, they can't all be wrong,
can they?

18:39.619 --> 18:41.913
(man) Have you ever heard
gossip about yourself

18:41.996 --> 18:44.165
and thought, "How can they
say that about me

18:44.249 --> 18:45.708
when they don't even know me?"

18:45.792 --> 18:48.002
(woman) Most of what is written
about King Richard

18:48.086 --> 18:49.796
is based on Tudor history

18:49.879 --> 18:53.716
because Henry VII
won the Battle of Bosworth.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.885
(man) If you get in quick
with the first lie,

18:55.969 --> 18:58.471
and repeat it often enough,
then it becomes the truth.

18:58.555 --> 19:00.640
And Richard wasn't around
to defend himself, was he?

19:02.767 --> 19:04.227
I'd like to join your society.

19:04.310 --> 19:06.980
Oh, hail fellow well met!

19:07.063 --> 19:08.898
You must commune
with us, Philippa.

19:08.982 --> 19:12.735
I'm about to procure a round of
Hook Norton's Old Hooky ales.

19:12.819 --> 19:16.072
Oh, thanks. I'll just
have a ginger beer, please.

19:16.155 --> 19:19.367
(man) "If you can bear
to hear the truth you've spoken

19:19.450 --> 19:23.413
twisted by knaves
to make a trap for fools,

19:23.496 --> 19:27.333
or watch the things
you gave your life to, broken,

19:27.417 --> 19:30.628
and stoop and build them up

19:30.712 --> 19:32.630
with worn-out tools."

19:37.635 --> 19:38.803
I'll get the drinks in.

19:39.929 --> 19:41.848
Six pints of Old Hooky ale,

19:41.931 --> 19:43.808
and a ginger beer, please.

19:43.892 --> 19:47.520
He's very eloquent.
Does he work in a theatre?

19:47.604 --> 19:49.272
No. Carphone Warehouse.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.858
Just till he gets back
on his feet again.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.611
You sure you want to join
this group?

19:54.694 --> 19:57.447
You look quite normal.

19:59.574 --> 20:00.992
I'm not.

20:03.286 --> 20:06.331
So, why are you all interested
in Richard III?

20:06.414 --> 20:08.333
Everyone has their own reasons,
I suppose.

20:08.416 --> 20:11.544
But the one thing
that binds us Ricardians

20:11.628 --> 20:15.131
is that we stand united
against lies and falsehoods,

20:15.214 --> 20:18.551
whether they be peddled
on Tudor printing presses

20:18.635 --> 20:19.844
or on Twitter.

20:20.929 --> 20:24.724
-What about you?
-Oh. Not quite sure.

20:25.808 --> 20:28.353
I'd quite like to pay
my respects, though.

20:28.436 --> 20:30.396
You know, maybe
visit his grave one day.

20:30.480 --> 20:33.274
Oh, you'll have a job.
There isn't one.

20:33.358 --> 20:35.360
Depending on who you talk to,

20:35.443 --> 20:37.570
he was either thrown
into the River Soar

20:37.654 --> 20:40.531
or his mortal remains
are lost to history.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.084
(engine revs)

21:04.263 --> 21:06.474
-(Max) Hi, Mum.
-Hey. How was it?

21:06.557 --> 21:08.017
-(Max) Really good.
-Yeah?

21:08.101 --> 21:10.645
-(Max) M dies at the end.
-Oh, great.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.730
-Forty people were killed.
-(Philippa) Yeah?

21:12.814 --> 21:14.148
But James Bond only killed

21:14.232 --> 21:16.150
-17 people.
-Right.

21:16.234 --> 21:20.780
Which means 23 of them were
killed by unlicensed people.

21:20.863 --> 21:23.866
Oh. Oh, dear.
Er, don't get too comfortable.

21:23.950 --> 21:27.161
It's a school night. Remember?
Go on, I'll be up in a minute.

21:27.245 --> 21:28.329
Goodnight.

21:30.206 --> 21:31.708
-Night, Max.
-(Max) Goodnight.

21:33.084 --> 21:34.127
Did you manage to relax?

21:34.210 --> 21:36.713
Yeah, it was nice and quiet,
really.

21:38.297 --> 21:39.924
You went out?

21:40.008 --> 21:42.468
Yeah, just to the corner shop.

21:42.552 --> 21:44.637
For... tomatoes.

21:47.390 --> 21:48.307
Right. I'm away home.

21:48.391 --> 21:49.809
-(Philippa) Goodnight.
-Night.

22:18.379 --> 22:20.131
Mum, you look like a panda.

22:20.214 --> 22:22.341
Oh, thanks, darling.

22:23.342 --> 22:24.635
Don't go to work today, Mum.

22:24.719 --> 22:26.345
Stay at home
until you feel better.

22:26.429 --> 22:28.723
Thanks, sweetheart.
Think I will.

22:28.806 --> 22:30.349
Look after your brother,
all right?

22:55.625 --> 22:57.251
(Philippa) I have a condition...

22:59.962 --> 23:02.006
which I have to manage.

23:04.675 --> 23:08.387
It's called ME and, erm...

23:09.514 --> 23:12.058
it flares up when I'm stressed.

23:16.104 --> 23:18.689
It's funny, people find out
this one thing about you

23:18.773 --> 23:20.525
and that's all they can see.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.657
But there's more to me
than that.

23:36.791 --> 23:38.960
I've been trying to work out
why you're here.

23:40.503 --> 23:42.505
I'm wondering
if it's because you're lost.

23:48.302 --> 23:50.471
-(Philippa) Hi.
-(both) Hi.

23:52.056 --> 23:54.183
We think you might be having
some sort of breakdown.

23:54.267 --> 23:56.853
We think
you need to talk to someone.

23:58.020 --> 23:59.814
Sorry, is this some
kind of intervention?

23:59.897 --> 24:02.066
No. You haven't answered
our calls,

24:02.150 --> 24:04.610
you haven't answered our texts.
What have you been doing?

24:04.694 --> 24:06.821
And you should know
Tony's saying that you left

24:06.904 --> 24:08.281
because of your health.

24:08.364 --> 24:11.284
He says he's been covering up
the extent of your ME for years.

24:11.367 --> 24:13.578
How can he say that?
It's not even true.

24:13.661 --> 24:16.372
But you're not there to defend
yourself though, are you?

24:19.584 --> 24:22.837
Do you know the principle
"Innocent until proven guilty"

24:22.920 --> 24:25.423
was introduced 500 years ago?

24:25.506 --> 24:27.425
By Richard III, actually.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.594
(woman) No.

24:29.677 --> 24:33.389
No, neither did I
until about two days ago.

24:33.472 --> 24:34.932
Excuse me.

24:35.016 --> 24:36.517
Where are you going?

24:38.019 --> 24:41.063
-Not back to work.
-What'll you do, Phil?

24:41.147 --> 24:44.609
I don't know. Maybe,
erm... have an adventure?

24:56.746 --> 24:58.289
(Philippa) Jessica,
nice to meet you.

24:58.372 --> 24:59.790
Pleased to meet you too,
Philippa.

24:59.874 --> 25:01.792
Welcome
to the King Richard family.

25:01.876 --> 25:05.796
You wrote to me about
Greyfriars Church and the king?

25:05.880 --> 25:08.883
Yes, nobody now knows
where the church is located,

25:08.966 --> 25:11.510
but you believe that's where
they buried Richard

25:11.594 --> 25:12.887
after the Battle of Bosworth?

25:12.970 --> 25:15.473
All the sources suggest
he could have been.

25:15.556 --> 25:18.017
My guess is
he'd be under the choir.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.894
It's the part of the church
where they buried

25:19.977 --> 25:22.188
-all the important people.
-Ah, OK.

25:22.271 --> 25:24.523
Er, but, you know,
you really should have a word

25:24.607 --> 25:25.650
with Graham Naismith.

25:25.733 --> 25:27.693
He's an amateur historian
I came across.

25:27.777 --> 25:28.986
Lives over there in Cornwall.

25:29.070 --> 25:32.865
-(Raife) Mum!
-Yes, in here. Hey, love.

25:32.949 --> 25:34.408
Did you stay at home all day?

25:34.492 --> 25:36.077
No, I wasn't feeling very well.

25:36.160 --> 25:38.621
-I'm feeling much better now.
-(Raife) What's for dinner?

25:38.704 --> 25:41.415
Erm, I don't know. I haven't...
I'll do it in a minute.

25:41.499 --> 25:44.168
Can we just order some pizza?
Max knows how to do it.

25:44.252 --> 25:46.879
Yes, OK.
Take my card, it's just there.

25:48.339 --> 25:51.342
Don't tell your dad, OK?
Where is he, by the way?

25:51.425 --> 25:53.052
Entertaining his female suitor.

25:53.135 --> 25:54.887
Ah, makes sense.

25:54.971 --> 25:58.015
I was talking to Jessica
in San Diego and she said

25:58.099 --> 26:00.268
you were the man to speak to
about Richard's grave.

26:00.351 --> 26:02.770
Ah, the holy grail.

26:02.853 --> 26:04.939
Well, if you're interested
in all that,

26:05.022 --> 26:06.357
I can send you a link
if you like.

26:06.440 --> 26:09.110
Oh, Graham, that'd be...
that'd be fantastic, thank you.

26:09.193 --> 26:12.822
The key is to find
Robert Herrick's garden.

26:12.905 --> 26:14.865
-Whose?
-Robert Herrick.

26:14.949 --> 26:16.575
He was a former
mayor of Leicester

26:16.659 --> 26:19.495
who supposedly built a shrine
in the grounds of his mansion

26:19.578 --> 26:23.582
in the early 1600s to mark the
spot where Richard was buried.

26:24.458 --> 26:27.336
Sorry, Graham, I can't help
noticing your hair.

26:28.379 --> 26:31.966
It looks a lot
like Richard III's.

26:32.049 --> 26:33.634
Is that deliberate?

26:34.844 --> 26:36.053
Yes.

26:36.846 --> 26:39.974
Robert Herrick was mayor
of Leicester in 1593

26:40.057 --> 26:42.351
and I think again in 1605.

26:42.435 --> 26:44.979
There's a map somewhere
in the city archives

26:45.062 --> 26:47.023
which shows
where he built his mansion

26:47.106 --> 26:48.607
and the layout of the grounds.

26:49.525 --> 26:51.777
Graham this is all so useful.
Thank you.

26:53.279 --> 26:55.865
I really like your hair
like that, by the way.

26:56.699 --> 27:00.119
It's like I've been sitting here
talking to Richard himself.

27:26.228 --> 27:29.023
"...naked of all clothing
and laid upon horseback

27:29.106 --> 27:32.068
with the arms and legs
hanging down on both sides,

27:32.985 --> 27:34.695
the body of King Richard
was brought

27:34.779 --> 27:37.490
to the abbey of
Monks Franciscans at Leicester."

27:38.616 --> 27:40.159
"A miserable spectacle."

28:03.641 --> 28:06.685
-Did the boys get off OK?
-(John) Er, yeah, fine, fine.

28:06.769 --> 28:08.938
You know, I've got
a good feeling about today.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.439
Do you?

28:10.523 --> 28:12.858
Well, I mean, if Tony's
sending you on this course

28:12.942 --> 28:15.903
then he obviously
still thinks highly of you.

28:15.986 --> 28:18.239
Yeah, no, I wouldn't get
too excited, it's just...

28:18.322 --> 28:20.199
And you'll be back by 7:30?

28:20.282 --> 28:22.410
I've got to be away by then,
7:45 the latest.

28:22.493 --> 28:25.079
Yeah, I know. Don't wanna keep
Seafood Sarah waiting, do we?

28:25.162 --> 28:26.789
Pardon?

28:26.872 --> 28:28.457
OK, bye.

28:30.334 --> 28:31.877
As you've probably worked out,

28:31.961 --> 28:35.673
I'm not going on
a work training day thing.

28:37.091 --> 28:39.969
Going to Leicester,
for a lecture.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.304
About you, actually.

28:43.389 --> 28:45.391
In fact, today's all about you.

28:47.935 --> 28:51.689
You're quite young, aren't you?
Thirty-two.

28:51.772 --> 28:54.859
Same age as Alexander the Great
when he died.

28:56.235 --> 28:57.570
I'm...

28:58.988 --> 29:00.448
forty-five.

29:02.283 --> 29:04.702
I've been told I could
easily pass for 37.

29:06.704 --> 29:09.290
Well, some days, I feel like 97.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.670
I was reading that you were an
advocate for the printing press

29:14.753 --> 29:18.507
at a time when it was considered
the work of the Devil.

29:18.591 --> 29:19.967
And those same machines

29:20.050 --> 29:21.927
were used to print lies
about you.

29:23.846 --> 29:25.639
Five hundred years of lies.

29:37.902 --> 29:39.904
Upon Edward IV's death,

29:39.987 --> 29:43.657
Richard put the King's
young sons, his own nephews,

29:43.741 --> 29:45.075
in the Tower of London.

29:45.159 --> 29:47.453
Then he made his move.

29:47.536 --> 29:49.788
First he put it about that
these boys were illegitimate.

29:49.872 --> 29:51.665
Then on June the 26th,

29:51.749 --> 29:55.294
he declared himself
King Richard III.

29:55.377 --> 29:57.963
The classic coup d'etat.

29:58.047 --> 30:00.090
And of course,
the princes in the Tower

30:00.174 --> 30:01.800
were never seen
or heard of again.

30:01.884 --> 30:03.886
-Er...
-Oh. Yes?

30:03.969 --> 30:07.848
Sorry, but his nephews
were  illegitimate.

30:07.932 --> 30:12.019
Edward IV had already
married Lady Eleanor Butler,

30:12.102 --> 30:14.146
so his marriage
to the princes' mother,

30:14.230 --> 30:16.482
Elizabeth Woodville,
was unlawful.

30:16.565 --> 30:18.734
Those boys would never
have been crowned.

30:18.817 --> 30:21.237
They were born out
of an illegal marriage.

30:21.320 --> 30:23.697
Madam, on the Royal
Family's own website,

30:23.781 --> 30:27.117
you will find Richard
listed there as a usurper.

30:27.201 --> 30:29.036
Then people
are being misinformed.

30:29.119 --> 30:31.163
There's actually
no contemporary evidence

30:31.247 --> 30:32.873
to say he murdered the princes.

30:32.957 --> 30:35.084
Tyrrell's admission
that he killed the boys

30:35.167 --> 30:36.418
on Richard's orders?

30:36.502 --> 30:39.713
Or the writings of
the Italian courtier Mancini.

30:39.797 --> 30:41.882
Unsupported Tudor propaganda.

30:41.966 --> 30:45.553
And wilful misrepresentation
of Mancini.

30:45.636 --> 30:47.054
Respectively.

30:48.722 --> 30:51.600
I strongly feel that
he's innocent of their murders.

30:51.684 --> 30:55.354
Oh, you "feel" strongly.
You have a feeling.

30:55.437 --> 30:57.064
A hunch, perhaps?

30:57.147 --> 30:59.358
Like Richard?

30:59.441 --> 31:01.110
(laughter)

31:01.193 --> 31:03.237
Actually, no one who met him
when he was alive

31:03.320 --> 31:04.697
said he had a hunchback.

31:04.780 --> 31:06.991
(lecturer) The opinions
of the greatest historians

31:07.074 --> 31:10.327
of the modern age are
in almost unanimous agreement

31:10.411 --> 31:12.788
that Richard III, who of course
met his ignominious end

31:12.871 --> 31:15.040
not ten miles away
from where we now sit,

31:15.124 --> 31:19.044
was a usurper
and, all things considered,

31:19.128 --> 31:21.589
a pretty unsavoury individual.

31:21.672 --> 31:23.924
The evidence is that...
that he brought the country

31:24.008 --> 31:26.927
the strong leadership it needed
after the death of his brother

31:27.011 --> 31:29.430
and went on to create
a fairer and more just society.

31:29.513 --> 31:32.141
Perhaps you might tell us
your name?

31:33.559 --> 31:34.643
Erm...

31:35.769 --> 31:38.731
Philippa... Langley.

31:38.814 --> 31:39.898
And you're from?

31:41.317 --> 31:42.943
The Richard III Society.

31:43.027 --> 31:44.403
Oh, the fan club.

31:44.486 --> 31:47.197
Well, thank you,
Philippa Langley.

31:47.281 --> 31:49.783
But you might like to know
that the study of history

31:49.867 --> 31:51.368
is an academic discipline

31:51.452 --> 31:54.788
based upon rigorous
and dispassionate research

31:54.872 --> 31:58.208
so that one might
take the evidence and study it

31:58.292 --> 32:01.420
and then draw conclusions,
rather than the other way round.

32:01.503 --> 32:06.383
Now, that's not a feeling,
that's a fact. Hmm.

32:11.472 --> 32:13.932
Dr Ashdown-Hill.
I've read your book.

32:14.016 --> 32:16.143
I was wondering
if you'd sign my copy, please.

32:16.226 --> 32:18.896
Of course!
Well done, by the way, dear.

32:18.979 --> 32:20.814
You stood your ground.

32:20.898 --> 32:23.484
You pay no attention to him,
pompous old queen.

32:23.567 --> 32:25.152
-There you go.
-(woman) Thank you.

32:25.235 --> 32:28.113
There's a woman in her 60s
living in Canada,

32:28.197 --> 32:30.157
and a cabinet maker in Clapham

32:30.240 --> 32:32.284
who've got more claim
to the throne than Henry VII.

32:32.368 --> 32:34.953
-Or any of the other Tudors.
-Pardon?

32:35.037 --> 32:36.705
I've just spent
the last 18 months

32:36.789 --> 32:39.416
tracing the mitochondrial DNA
of Richard's sister

32:39.500 --> 32:41.710
all the way down to
their present-day descendants.

32:41.794 --> 32:43.504
I'm about to publish
the results.

32:43.587 --> 32:44.797
That's amazing!

32:45.631 --> 32:48.008
Er, actually, I was wondering
if I could ask you something.

32:48.092 --> 32:49.218
We'll have to walk and talk.

32:49.301 --> 32:50.636
-Of course.
-I'm already late.

32:51.303 --> 32:54.014
(Philippa) What I wanted to say
is that you've so inspired me,

32:54.098 --> 32:55.974
I want to try and find
Greyfriars Church.

32:56.058 --> 32:57.893
(Ashdown-Hill)
Oh, that's long since gone.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.520
No, that disappeared
centuries ago.

32:59.603 --> 33:00.979
(Philippa) Right. Well, we know

33:01.063 --> 33:02.564
it had to be on
a main thoroughfare

33:02.648 --> 33:06.110
so the friars could beg alms
from passers-by, right?

33:06.193 --> 33:08.612
And that's to the south
of St Martin's Church.

33:08.696 --> 33:10.698
Now the cathedral,
which is to the east

33:10.781 --> 33:12.866
-of the old city wall...
-Taxi!

33:12.950 --> 33:14.952
Yes, that's very impressive.

33:15.035 --> 33:16.787
I know
what you're really looking for,

33:16.870 --> 33:18.831
and, er, it's not an old church.

33:18.914 --> 33:19.915
Oh?

33:19.998 --> 33:21.417
Well, I wish you
the best of luck.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.836
Plenty have tried to find him
and failed.

33:23.919 --> 33:25.254
Gateway House, please.

33:25.337 --> 33:27.423
Well, er, do you have
any advice?

33:29.800 --> 33:32.469
There's a good chance Richard
is under a shopping centre,

33:32.553 --> 33:35.681
forever entombed in a concrete
pile beneath Topshop.

33:35.764 --> 33:36.765
(Philippa) Right.

33:36.849 --> 33:38.767
But when the Dissolution
occurred,

33:38.851 --> 33:40.477
the friaries and monasteries

33:40.561 --> 33:42.479
were still regarded
as sacred places.

33:42.563 --> 33:45.232
People are very superstitious
about things like that.

33:45.315 --> 33:47.067
So, although
they may have rebuilt

33:47.151 --> 33:48.485
the surrounding buildings,

33:48.569 --> 33:50.696
the site of a church
like Greyfriars, for instance,

33:50.779 --> 33:52.281
was often left undisturbed.

33:53.574 --> 33:55.284
So what are you saying?

33:56.493 --> 33:58.078
Look for an open space.

33:58.162 --> 34:01.081
OK. Thank you. All right.

35:02.351 --> 35:04.770
"From this spot were scattered
into the River Soar

35:04.853 --> 35:06.605
the remains of Richard III."

35:23.831 --> 35:25.999
(horn blares)

35:47.688 --> 35:49.940
What was that? On the bridge?

35:50.691 --> 35:52.693
-I thought it'd be funny.
-Well, it wasn't.

35:54.862 --> 35:56.488
Sorry, did you just talk?

35:57.030 --> 35:58.991
How come
you've never spoken before?

35:59.074 --> 36:00.993
You've never asked me anything
before.

36:01.076 --> 36:02.160
Right.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.622
Wait, you don't happen to know
where you are, do you?

36:05.706 --> 36:07.124
-Might help.
-Watch out.

36:07.207 --> 36:09.793
-(car horn beeps)
-You were dead. Sorry.

36:30.480 --> 36:32.482
(bird wings flutter)

37:32.084 --> 37:33.543
(breathes heavily)

37:34.962 --> 37:37.547
-(man) Are you lost?
-Sorry?

37:38.924 --> 37:40.008
Erm...

37:42.052 --> 37:44.179
Excuse me, could you, erm...

37:47.349 --> 37:49.810
Could you tell me what
that letter represents, please?

37:50.727 --> 37:52.270
Just means reserved.

37:52.354 --> 37:54.398
It's the social services
car park.

37:54.481 --> 37:56.274
That bay's reserved
for one of the managers.

37:56.358 --> 37:58.193
Of course. Reserved.

37:59.778 --> 38:01.154
Thanks.

38:11.081 --> 38:12.582
Oh.

38:12.666 --> 38:14.418
Oh, shit. Shit.

38:16.712 --> 38:17.921
Thanks.

38:19.673 --> 38:21.008
Shit, shit.

38:21.091 --> 38:23.802
-(whistle blows)
-Oh, fuck. Sorry.

38:23.885 --> 38:27.305
No! No! No, no, no!

38:27.389 --> 38:28.765
Oh, no!

38:36.273 --> 38:37.774
I'm so sorry.

38:40.110 --> 38:41.903
Glass?

38:41.987 --> 38:43.280
I'd better not.

38:43.363 --> 38:47.701
No, don't want to be ill for,
er, work tomorrow, do we?

38:52.539 --> 38:53.749
Was Sarah OK?

38:54.958 --> 38:57.878
Sarah's fine. Sarah's normal.

39:03.216 --> 39:04.426
Tony rang.

39:04.509 --> 39:06.970
I know you haven't been
in work for the last two weeks.

39:07.763 --> 39:10.599
I'm not actually that bothered
that you lied to me

39:10.682 --> 39:15.437
or selfishly ruined my evening,
but what about the boys?

39:15.520 --> 39:17.856
I told you we can't afford
for you to be out of work.

39:17.939 --> 39:19.399
I know, I know.

39:25.697 --> 39:28.658
It's none of my business,
but were you with someone today?

39:31.453 --> 39:32.746
No, absolutely not.

39:33.914 --> 39:35.624
Sorry, what do you mean, John?

39:35.707 --> 39:40.253
Well, I... You're clearly
hiding something from me.

39:40.337 --> 39:42.339
I mean, where were you today?

39:42.422 --> 39:44.800
-Erm, Leicester.
-Leicester?

39:44.883 --> 39:48.470
Look, I've had an idea.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.013
Now, just listen.

39:51.765 --> 39:54.518
It's not as mad as it's...
probably going to sound,

39:54.601 --> 39:58.021
but, erm, well, I've been
doing a lot of research.

39:58.105 --> 40:00.232
All the information
I need to find him,

40:00.315 --> 40:02.400
well, it's all out there
but it's in...

40:02.484 --> 40:05.112
lots of different little pieces
scattered all over the place

40:05.195 --> 40:08.740
and I... I don't think anybody's
brought it all together before,

40:08.824 --> 40:09.991
but I...

40:12.994 --> 40:14.538
I know I can find him.

40:15.664 --> 40:17.165
Who?

40:18.583 --> 40:19.793
Richard.

40:19.876 --> 40:21.336
Richard who?

40:22.254 --> 40:24.714
Sorry, the Third.

40:24.798 --> 40:26.174
The king?

40:26.258 --> 40:29.136
(Philippa) If I can find him,
I can give him a voice.

40:30.887 --> 40:32.139
I think you need help.

40:32.222 --> 40:33.557
John, if you...

40:33.640 --> 40:36.393
if you could just understand
the way it's made me feel.

40:37.727 --> 40:40.397
You know, when I'm in the middle
of my research,

40:40.480 --> 40:43.024
when I'm thinking about
what I can do for him, I...

40:45.485 --> 40:48.196
I feel energised.

40:48.280 --> 40:49.614
I feel happy.

40:50.532 --> 40:52.117
-Do you?
-Yes.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.578
And this, is that why
you wanted me to leave?

40:54.661 --> 40:56.872
Because I didn't make you
feel energised or happy?

40:56.955 --> 40:59.541
-You walked out, John.
-It was constructive dismissal.

40:59.624 --> 41:01.168
(sighs)

41:03.461 --> 41:04.838
Always looking for something,

41:04.921 --> 41:07.174
isn't that what you
always used to say about me?

41:07.257 --> 41:09.968
Well... Well, now I actually am.

41:12.220 --> 41:15.182
Richard III. (chuckles)

41:16.057 --> 41:18.810
I remember there was a picture
in the textbook at school

41:18.894 --> 41:22.480
of Richard,
and he creeped me out.

41:22.564 --> 41:25.025
It's the evil hunchback that
killed the princes in the Tower.

41:25.108 --> 41:28.195
Yes, but he didn't kill
his nephews and he wasn't evil.

41:29.070 --> 41:31.531
I don't believe
he even had a hunchback.

41:31.615 --> 41:35.035
That's all stuff the Tudors put
about to trash his reputation.

41:35.118 --> 41:38.705
He was a good man.
I'm convinced of it.

41:38.788 --> 41:40.290
But nobody's interested.

41:41.791 --> 41:44.211
If I can find him,
then they would be.

41:46.004 --> 41:47.714
What are you talking about?

41:47.797 --> 41:50.675
OK, imagine this.
You're Henry VII.

41:50.759 --> 41:54.262
You're... You're the new king
and you need everyone

41:54.346 --> 41:56.973
to hate the king
that came before you, Richard.

41:57.057 --> 42:00.393
So you'd think that in your
first speech to the country,

42:00.477 --> 42:03.521
which was recorded
in the parliamentary archives,

42:03.605 --> 42:06.107
that you might mention
the fact that he'd killed

42:06.191 --> 42:08.693
those two little princes,
wouldn't you?

42:08.777 --> 42:10.612
But he doesn't.

42:10.695 --> 42:12.739
You're starting to
sound slightly mad.

42:12.822 --> 42:15.283
He doesn't mention them. Why?

42:15.367 --> 42:17.535
Because they must've
still been alive.

42:20.538 --> 42:21.748
(sighs)

42:23.124 --> 42:25.710
You know, I...
I think you might be right.

42:26.795 --> 42:29.839
If he didn't kill them
and he wasn't a hunchback...

42:32.342 --> 42:35.011
Oh, my God, I think I've got it.

42:36.388 --> 42:38.598
Of course, the hump.

42:39.891 --> 42:43.687
He must've stuffed the princes
up the back of his jumper!

42:44.521 --> 42:46.189
There, you've cracked it!

42:50.986 --> 42:52.654
(door opens)

42:53.613 --> 42:55.240
(door slams)

43:17.512 --> 43:19.973
Hello?
Yes, I'd like to speak to, erm,

43:20.056 --> 43:22.225
Richard Buckley, please.
Archaeological Services.

43:22.309 --> 43:24.185
(teacher) Stay wide.
Keep your shape.

43:24.269 --> 43:26.604
Support the scrum half.

43:26.688 --> 43:29.524
I just thought as a Leicester
company, you might be

43:29.607 --> 43:32.027
interested in sponsoring
the search for a king.

43:32.110 --> 43:35.280
Hello, er, this is a message
from Philippa Langley

43:35.363 --> 43:37.282
for Richard Buckley.

43:37.365 --> 43:39.409
Think there's a dig that
he might be interested in.

43:39.492 --> 43:42.203
My phone number is 07...
Oh, my God!

43:42.287 --> 43:44.122
-Did you see that?
-(teacher) He's fine.

43:44.205 --> 43:46.291
Oh, my God, darling, are you OK?

43:46.541 --> 43:48.501
(Richard) Please don't take
this the wrong way.

43:48.585 --> 43:49.794
No.

43:49.878 --> 43:52.881
But even from my perspective,

43:52.964 --> 43:57.510
this is starting to look a bit
like an unhealthy obsession?

43:57.594 --> 44:00.013
I can't believe
you just said that.

44:00.096 --> 44:02.557
I'm doing this for you.

44:02.640 --> 44:04.851
Do you know what people
say about you?

44:06.269 --> 44:08.188
I'm sure it's not
particularly flattering.

44:08.271 --> 44:11.024
Do you know
who William Shakespeare is?

44:12.442 --> 44:14.611
OK, well, he was
a very celebrated writer,

44:14.694 --> 44:18.448
and everyone thinks he's amazing
and he wrote a play about you.

44:18.531 --> 44:20.617
And there's this bit
where you're supposedly

44:20.700 --> 44:22.952
-talking about yourself.
-Go on.

44:23.036 --> 44:25.080
"So lame and unfashionable

44:25.163 --> 44:27.457
that dogs bark at me
as I halt by them."

44:29.167 --> 44:31.836
You're so weird,
that you even freak out dogs.

44:31.920 --> 44:34.255
That's a bit harsh.

44:34.339 --> 44:36.424
(laptop chimes)

44:36.508 --> 44:37.842
Thank you for your enquiry,

44:37.926 --> 44:39.761
but this is not something
we wish to pursue.

44:39.844 --> 44:41.888
Unfortunately,
we are unable to assist you.

44:41.971 --> 44:44.224
This is not
the sort of project...

44:44.307 --> 44:46.184
Is this a joke?
It's getting rather annoying.

44:46.267 --> 44:48.061
-The answer is no.
-Sadly, no.

44:48.144 --> 44:51.147
Unfortunately, your application
has been rejected.

44:51.231 --> 44:54.150
Your enquiry
was not appropriate.

44:54.234 --> 44:55.485
The answer is no.

44:59.322 --> 45:02.033
As you all know,
I've been doing some research

45:02.117 --> 45:04.494
into finding
King Richard's grave,

45:04.577 --> 45:07.205
with the intention of
giving him a proper burial

45:07.288 --> 45:09.165
with a royal coat of arms
on his tomb

45:09.249 --> 45:12.377
and restoring him to
his rightful place in history.

45:12.460 --> 45:14.212
And a "hey, nonny nonny"
to you.

45:14.295 --> 45:16.506
Well, for personal reasons,

45:16.589 --> 45:20.593
I'm going to have to suspend
my research indefinitely...

45:20.677 --> 45:22.929
This is a travesty!
You can't stop now!

45:23.012 --> 45:25.682
-I won't allow it!
-Keith!

45:25.765 --> 45:27.308
If you don't mind me saying,

45:27.392 --> 45:31.646
perhaps the kindest thing
is to set the girl free.

45:31.729 --> 45:32.897
Many a Ricardian,

45:32.981 --> 45:35.442
and I'm certainly not looking
at you, you personally,

45:35.525 --> 45:40.405
has wandered down that same path
only to discover little more

45:40.488 --> 45:43.908
than the calcified remains
of his own ambition.

45:46.536 --> 45:48.288
What's happened, Philippa?

45:49.914 --> 45:51.541
I've been trying
to generate interest

45:51.624 --> 45:53.751
from possible sponsors,
but I haven't had any luck,

45:53.835 --> 45:58.298
and I can't get through to
a guy called Richard Buckley,

45:58.381 --> 45:59.632
a Leicester archaeologist.

45:59.716 --> 46:01.718
Philippa,
I used to live next door

46:01.801 --> 46:03.553
to the Lord Mayor of Leicester.

46:04.888 --> 46:07.932
The current Lord Mayor.
We used to be neighbours.

46:09.434 --> 46:11.269
Well, anyway, my mind's
made up on this.

46:11.352 --> 46:13.605
I could ask him if he'd help.

46:20.195 --> 46:23.156
Dad, how heavy is 330 pounds?

46:23.239 --> 46:25.450
(Max) Hello! Is anyone in there?

46:25.533 --> 46:27.452
About two of me.

46:27.535 --> 46:29.245
And that's how heavy
the cannon balls are.

46:29.329 --> 46:32.290
And they could fire them
two miles!

46:32.373 --> 46:34.667
(John) Imagine one of those
landing on your foot.

46:35.919 --> 46:37.670
-(Philippa) Hey.
-(Raife) Hi, Mum.

46:37.754 --> 46:39.464
-(John) Hi.
-(Philippa) Hey.

46:39.547 --> 46:41.591
-(John) Found him yet?
-Very funny.

46:44.177 --> 46:45.887
So, how are you?

46:45.970 --> 46:48.932
Psoriasis is back on my elbows.

46:49.015 --> 46:50.266
Work's a bit shit,

46:50.350 --> 46:53.520
but just trying to make the best
of it, like everyone else.

46:54.646 --> 46:56.814
Well, almost  everyone else.

46:58.650 --> 47:00.902
I spoke to Awusi, from work.

47:00.985 --> 47:02.987
Hmm! And what did she
have to say?

47:03.071 --> 47:06.616
I should know my place?
Start baking cakes?

47:06.699 --> 47:08.326
People do like cake.

47:09.410 --> 47:10.495
Hmm.

47:11.871 --> 47:15.083
John, I... I need to ask you
to do something.

47:16.501 --> 47:17.961
No.

47:18.044 --> 47:19.712
You don't know
what it is I'm gonna say.

47:19.796 --> 47:21.005
Well, whatever it is, no.

47:21.089 --> 47:23.299
I need you to let your flat go
and move back in with us.

47:23.383 --> 47:25.510
-Are you serious?
-Yes.

47:25.593 --> 47:28.555
I feel like I'm being
cuckolded by a ghost.

47:28.638 --> 47:31.724
John, I just...
I really need to do this.

47:34.018 --> 47:35.270
I'm sorry.

47:35.353 --> 47:36.646
(John sighs)

47:40.024 --> 47:42.318
It's colossal, isn't it, Dad?

47:42.402 --> 47:43.653
It is.

47:43.736 --> 47:47.448
The thing about Mons Meg
is it soon became obsolete

47:47.532 --> 47:51.744
because it was so heavy,
they couldn't move it anywhere.

47:51.828 --> 47:54.872
So it wasn't so much
a colossal gun in the end

47:54.956 --> 47:57.417
as a colossal waste of time.

47:57.500 --> 47:58.501
He was talking to you,

47:58.585 --> 48:00.545
but really
he was saying that to Mum.

48:00.628 --> 48:03.089
OK, boys, it's nearly time
for the one o'clock gun.

48:03.172 --> 48:04.716
-Shall we go?
-Yeah.

48:13.224 --> 48:14.684
(John)
The grass is always greener

48:14.767 --> 48:17.103
-for you, Philippa, isn't it?
-(Max) Hurry up, Raife.

48:17.186 --> 48:19.606
Other women seem
perfectly happy with their lot.

48:19.689 --> 48:21.566
I don't think they are.

48:21.649 --> 48:24.402
Is, erm, is that the picture
you were shown at school?

48:24.485 --> 48:25.945
-That one?
-(John) Yes.

48:26.029 --> 48:27.864
The Tudors doctored
that painting.

48:27.947 --> 48:29.073
Really?

48:29.157 --> 48:31.159
It was X-rayed and proved
that they retouched it

48:31.242 --> 48:33.328
to make him look evil.
Look at the thumb.

48:33.411 --> 48:36.581
It's been sharpened into a claw.
They narrowed his eyes

48:36.664 --> 48:38.666
and made his lips
thinner and meaner.

48:38.750 --> 48:41.336
That is what he really
looked like.

48:41.419 --> 48:45.089
Normal eyes, normal mouth,
normal thumb. See?

48:45.173 --> 48:48.760
(John) Yes, but how can you
possibly find him on your own?

48:48.843 --> 48:51.054
And even if you do, what then?

48:51.137 --> 48:52.972
You're trying
to make him perfect.

48:53.056 --> 48:55.224
He wasn't. None of us is.

48:55.308 --> 48:57.894
We always try to
demonise people,

48:57.977 --> 49:00.146
or sanctify them.
You know, we're...

49:00.229 --> 49:02.440
You know,
we're all in the middle.

49:02.523 --> 49:04.776
I mean, I'm sure Mother Teresa

49:04.859 --> 49:07.695
left the top off the milk
now and then.

49:07.779 --> 49:11.115
And, er, I'll bet that
Genghis Khan

49:11.199 --> 49:13.284
occasionally picked up
bits of litter.

49:13.368 --> 49:15.995
Yeah. Human.

49:16.079 --> 49:18.873
Not perfect and not a...
not a demon either.

49:18.956 --> 49:21.834
(sighs) You always do
the same thing, Philippa.

49:21.918 --> 49:23.336
You pretend to ask me
something,

49:23.419 --> 49:26.589
but the truth is, you just
put a gun against my head.

49:26.673 --> 49:27.715
(cannon fires)

49:59.664 --> 50:04.168
Hi. Er, Philippa Langley
here to see Mr Buckley, please.

50:04.252 --> 50:06.546
And which company are you from?

50:06.629 --> 50:09.799
Oh, no. I'm not with a company,
but he is expecting me.

50:10.717 --> 50:12.093
Cheers.

50:14.721 --> 50:18.599
Erm, actually, sorry.
You don't...

50:18.683 --> 50:22.061
You don't happen to have
a knife, do you, at all?

50:22.145 --> 50:24.731
You're gonna have to take this
meeting on your own, Mathew.

50:24.814 --> 50:25.815
I've got too much to do.

50:25.898 --> 50:27.692
The bloody thing's
been forced on us anyway.

50:27.775 --> 50:29.986
Richard,
this is Philippa Langley.

50:30.069 --> 50:33.823
-Hello. Richard Buckley.
-Hello. Erm...

50:33.906 --> 50:36.159
This is my deputy,
Mathew Morris.

50:36.242 --> 50:38.411
Sorry, can I sit down, please?

50:38.494 --> 50:40.246
Er, yes, there, of course.
Erm...

50:40.329 --> 50:41.372
Thank you.

50:41.456 --> 50:43.541
Is anything...
anything the matter?

50:43.624 --> 50:46.461
So sorry, I've got ME
and it's a real illness.

50:46.544 --> 50:49.756
It... It comes on
at times of stress.

50:49.839 --> 50:51.632
Would you like a glass
of water?

50:51.716 --> 50:54.469
(Philippa) Yes, please,
that'd be lovely. Thank you.

50:54.552 --> 50:56.387
-Would you like to reschedule?
-No.

50:56.471 --> 51:01.434
Erm, actually, I've...
I've... got a cake for you.

51:01.517 --> 51:03.436
-Not for me.
-Thank you very much.

51:03.519 --> 51:05.271
(Philippa)
It's, er, lemon drizzle.

51:05.354 --> 51:07.106
Your receptionist
gave me a knife.

51:07.190 --> 51:08.232
Thank you.

51:08.316 --> 51:10.610
-(Philippa) Thank you so much.
-Pleasure.

51:11.277 --> 51:13.279
So you're a friend
of the Mayor?

51:13.362 --> 51:15.615
-No.
-Oh, I thought...

51:15.698 --> 51:19.994
My friend used to live next
door to him, so I sort of...

51:20.077 --> 51:22.580
I sort of used him
to get to you.

51:23.581 --> 51:26.209
-And it worked.
-(Philippa) Hmm.

51:26.292 --> 51:29.796
-So, er, what is it you wanted?
-Thank you.

51:29.879 --> 51:31.798
Erm...

51:31.881 --> 51:35.009
I've... I've got
a archaeological proposal

51:35.092 --> 51:37.345
about Richard III that might...

51:37.428 --> 51:39.138
I hope would be
of interest to you.

51:39.222 --> 51:40.890
OK.

51:40.973 --> 51:44.018
I'm planning to raise the funds
to pay you, of course.

51:44.101 --> 51:45.895
OK.

51:47.939 --> 51:49.899
Do you want me to start talking
about it now?

51:49.982 --> 51:51.984
Please do. (chuckles)

51:53.194 --> 51:56.155
-I want to dig for Richard.
-For Richard?

51:56.239 --> 51:57.573
Yes.

51:57.657 --> 52:00.618
And what is it
you want to dig for?

52:02.203 --> 52:04.163
Richard.

52:04.247 --> 52:05.498
The Third.

52:05.581 --> 52:08.918
Yes, in connection
with Richard III,

52:09.001 --> 52:10.920
what is it
you're hoping to find?

52:11.838 --> 52:13.214
Him. Him.

52:15.508 --> 52:16.843
-Him?
-(Philippa) Yes.

52:18.427 --> 52:19.929
I think I know where he is.

52:22.807 --> 52:25.726
I'm really sorry.
I think I need some air.

52:25.810 --> 52:27.019
(Buckley) Oh, of course.

52:27.103 --> 52:28.646
-I'm so sorry.
-Let me help you.

52:28.729 --> 52:30.356
-Would you mind?
-Could you?

52:30.439 --> 52:32.733
-Yes, of course. Of course.
-There we are.

52:32.817 --> 52:34.068
There we go.

52:35.236 --> 52:37.029
-Thank you.
-That's the way.

52:40.199 --> 52:42.451
(Buckley)
So, where do you think he is?

52:42.535 --> 52:45.788
It's my understanding that
his remains were thrown into...

52:45.872 --> 52:47.748
He wasn't thrown
into the River Soar.

52:50.167 --> 52:51.377
I read that in your book

52:51.460 --> 52:54.297
and that rumour
has been since discredited.

52:56.007 --> 53:00.469
Well, you may well be right.
He may be out there somewhere.

53:00.553 --> 53:02.805
But even if we...
even if we can pinpoint

53:02.889 --> 53:04.640
where Greyfriars once stood,

53:04.724 --> 53:07.226
finding him would be
virtually impossible.

53:07.310 --> 53:10.438
Literally finding a needle
in a haystack would be easier.

53:10.521 --> 53:13.482
Well, according to
the historian John Ashdown-Hill,

53:13.566 --> 53:15.026
the site of Greyfriars

53:15.109 --> 53:17.111
would probably still be
an open space somewhere.

53:18.571 --> 53:19.989
So, can you help me?

53:21.866 --> 53:22.867
No.

53:22.950 --> 53:26.412
-Oh.
-I don't look for people.

53:26.495 --> 53:28.372
If you go and look
for a single thing...

53:28.456 --> 53:30.124
He just called me a thing.

53:32.168 --> 53:34.879
Please don't call him that.
He is a person, not a thing.

53:34.962 --> 53:36.505
OK, I'm just saying,

53:36.589 --> 53:39.926
I don't go looking
for one specific thing.

53:40.009 --> 53:41.260
He just said it again.

53:42.094 --> 53:43.888
-You just said it again.
-Sorry.

53:43.971 --> 53:45.806
Er, the point
I'm trying to make

53:45.890 --> 53:49.018
is that's not how
archaeology works.

53:50.603 --> 53:52.146
All right, well, erm...

53:53.856 --> 53:55.942
Well, how about
we look for a church?

53:56.025 --> 53:58.235
The whole church,
not just Richard?

53:58.319 --> 54:01.781
What can you show us to back up
any of what you're saying?

54:01.864 --> 54:05.409
Actually, would you mind?
Thank you so much.

54:06.327 --> 54:10.831
Well, here's the relevant
parts of my research.

54:10.915 --> 54:13.000
Well, why don't you
leave this with me,

54:13.084 --> 54:16.879
-and I'll get back to you?
-Of course, yes.

54:16.963 --> 54:18.547
I've got copies.
You can keep that.

54:18.631 --> 54:19.882
Thank you.

54:20.967 --> 54:24.762
-So, are you feeling better now?
-Much.

54:26.764 --> 54:29.016
Goodbye, Mr Buckley.

54:29.100 --> 54:31.686
-Richard.
-The Third, yes.

54:31.769 --> 54:34.063
No. That's my name. Richard.

54:34.146 --> 54:36.691
-(laughs)
-Of course it is.

54:36.774 --> 54:38.234
Goodbye, Richard.

54:38.317 --> 54:40.820
-Thank you for the cake.
-My pleasure.

54:42.530 --> 54:44.115
-Bye, Mathew.
-Goodbye.

54:44.198 --> 54:45.408
-Yes.
-Thank you.

54:47.076 --> 54:49.870
I'll tell the Lord Mayor's
office that we've met her,

54:49.954 --> 54:52.373
duty done, and email her
thanks, but no, thanks.

54:52.456 --> 54:53.749
Yep, OK.

54:54.875 --> 54:57.878
It's funny.
I do enjoy talking to you.

54:57.962 --> 54:59.630
If it's to tell me again
how ugly I am,

54:59.714 --> 55:01.716
I'd, er, rather
you didn't bother.

55:01.799 --> 55:03.175
(Philippa sighs)

55:04.593 --> 55:06.971
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

55:08.848 --> 55:11.308
-The princes in the Tower.
-Hmm.

55:11.392 --> 55:14.729
-Your nephews.
-What about them?

55:15.771 --> 55:18.024
Well, what...
what happened to them?

55:21.694 --> 55:23.112
What do you think
happened to them?

55:23.195 --> 55:24.905
I don't know.

55:24.989 --> 55:27.324
Well, lots of people say you
killed them or had them killed

55:27.408 --> 55:30.036
so you could become king, but...

55:31.162 --> 55:32.246
Did you?

55:33.205 --> 55:34.832
You're really asking me that?

55:37.126 --> 55:41.172
Well, I know Edward
also had five daughters.

55:41.255 --> 55:44.884
And then there was your
older brother George's son.

55:44.967 --> 55:47.511
And your sister had seven sons,

55:47.595 --> 55:50.014
and they all had claims
to the throne.

55:51.015 --> 55:54.852
So if you killed one,
you'd have to kill them all.

55:54.935 --> 55:57.521
And that's what I tell people.

55:57.605 --> 55:58.606
(chuckles quietly)

56:03.986 --> 56:06.280
No. I... I'm sorry.

56:07.114 --> 56:11.160
Please don't go.
I'm just trying to understand.

56:17.625 --> 56:19.543
I'm sorry.

56:19.627 --> 56:21.629
(door opens)

56:24.381 --> 56:25.800
(door shuts)

56:28.385 --> 56:29.970
-Hey.
-How did it go?

56:30.054 --> 56:36.143
Erm, hard to say. OK, I think.
I don't know.

56:36.227 --> 56:38.854
It's just, suddenly,
it feels like, erm...

56:38.938 --> 56:40.815
Well, it's a bit scary
because it's...

56:41.690 --> 56:43.901
I feel it's the last-chance
saloon, you know?

56:45.611 --> 56:48.030
How'd it go with, erm,
Sea... Sarah.

56:48.114 --> 56:49.281
Yes, go on, Seafood Sarah.

56:49.365 --> 56:51.283
I know what
you and the boys call her.

56:51.367 --> 56:54.078
-Sorry.
-Anyway, we split up.

56:54.161 --> 56:55.913
Oh, no! Why?

56:55.996 --> 56:57.957
Because she bored
the bloody pants off me.

56:58.040 --> 57:00.751
A bit too normal, then.

57:00.835 --> 57:03.754
Every sentence started
with, "To tell the truth."

57:03.838 --> 57:07.091
Why would she automatically
assume I thought she was lying?

57:08.676 --> 57:09.677
Nothing else?

57:10.886 --> 57:14.807
-(sighs) She had big feet.
-There it is.

57:17.226 --> 57:18.602
You know, er, Richard III,

57:18.686 --> 57:22.106
he may have been, er,
a wise and just leader

57:22.189 --> 57:24.567
and I'm sure
had he lived longer,

57:24.650 --> 57:26.443
he would've avoided
all the bloodshed

57:26.527 --> 57:29.029
of the Reformation
and, you know, whatever.

57:29.113 --> 57:32.158
But would he have sold
his collection

57:32.241 --> 57:35.411
of Sex Pistols memorabilia
to help pay for a new kitchen?

57:35.494 --> 57:40.291
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
All day long. No question.

57:40.374 --> 57:44.336
Would he have driven 15 miles,
on a Sunday,

57:44.420 --> 57:47.715
to a service station
to buy his pregnant wife

57:47.798 --> 57:49.800
a Greggs cheese and onion pasty?

57:50.676 --> 57:54.722
No, he would've ridden there.
On his white steed.

57:55.806 --> 57:57.183
That's what he would have done.

58:16.327 --> 58:17.328
(John sighs)

58:17.411 --> 58:19.371
Do we really want to go
down that path again?

58:21.665 --> 58:23.500
-Probably not.
-No.

58:29.840 --> 58:32.259
-Night, love.
-Goodnight.

58:34.678 --> 58:36.096
(Philippa) Sleep well.

58:55.032 --> 58:56.533
(door slams)

58:57.284 --> 58:58.410
How did it go?

58:58.494 --> 59:00.996
"The university
faces challenging times."

59:01.080 --> 59:03.666
"Profound regret.
Blah-di-bloody-blah."

59:03.749 --> 59:05.251
They're shutting us down?

59:05.334 --> 59:08.420
They've withdrawn
their funding. Fuck!

59:08.504 --> 59:10.631
I've just ordered new laptops
for everyone.

59:10.714 --> 59:13.384
We're not shutting down, OK?

59:13.467 --> 59:16.262
Instead of working exclusively
for the university,

59:16.345 --> 59:19.974
we'll just have to find funding
from other sources.

59:21.684 --> 59:24.770
Mathew, did you send
that email to, er, Philippa?

59:24.853 --> 59:26.397
The cake lady?

59:26.480 --> 59:28.649
Er, no, I don't think
I have yet, no.

59:28.732 --> 59:31.652
Good. Don't.
Arrange another meeting.

59:37.283 --> 59:39.201
When I got the call,
I was convinced it would be,

59:39.285 --> 59:41.328
-"Thanks, but no, thanks."
-Oh, no, no, no.

59:41.412 --> 59:43.580
-(Mathew) Don't be silly.
-It's a new era for us.

59:43.664 --> 59:46.959
We are available for hire.
Ah, there we are.

59:50.671 --> 59:51.922
Oh, wow.

59:53.465 --> 59:56.635
So, that's St Martin's Church.
Now the cathedral.

59:59.221 --> 1:00:00.681
That's Robert Herrick's garden.

1:00:01.890 --> 1:00:04.643
We found it in
the council archives.

1:00:04.727 --> 1:00:07.855
I've heard about this map,
but I never thought I'd see it.

1:00:09.898 --> 1:00:11.233
What's that there?

1:00:11.317 --> 1:00:14.778
Some sort of garden feature.
A pagoda?

1:00:16.196 --> 1:00:18.073
Well, Herrick was rumoured
to have a king

1:00:18.157 --> 1:00:20.075
buried in his back garden.

1:00:20.159 --> 1:00:22.536
A circular feature with
four pathways leading to it

1:00:22.619 --> 1:00:24.747
says, "Come and have a look
at what I've got."

1:00:25.789 --> 1:00:26.790
Hmm!

1:00:26.874 --> 1:00:29.752
It's hard to be precise
about where that is, though.

1:00:29.835 --> 1:00:34.131
Erm, maps from that long ago
very often weren't to scale.

1:00:34.214 --> 1:00:35.299
Right.

1:00:37.176 --> 1:00:39.094
What about
if we just superimpose this

1:00:39.178 --> 1:00:40.304
over a modern map?

1:00:40.387 --> 1:00:42.973
No, that won't work because...

1:00:44.725 --> 1:00:47.061
Well, I don't know why not,
actually.

1:00:47.144 --> 1:00:49.355
Erm, has that been done before,
Mathew?

1:00:49.438 --> 1:00:51.815
-Worth a try, surely?
-Hmm.

1:00:55.986 --> 1:00:57.071
(Richard) Hmm.

1:00:57.863 --> 1:01:00.532
(Mathew)
So, here is the modern map.

1:01:00.616 --> 1:01:03.452
And here's the old one.

1:01:03.535 --> 1:01:09.666
Er, Leicester Cathedral
was then, erm, at St Martin's.

1:01:09.750 --> 1:01:13.087
Friar Lane is, er...

1:01:13.170 --> 1:01:15.964
Oh, still the same,
just, er, spelt differently.

1:01:16.673 --> 1:01:18.592
Now, Cank Street.
Where's Cank Street?

1:01:18.675 --> 1:01:22.304
Cank Street is now St Martin's.

1:01:22.388 --> 1:01:27.059
And, er, High Street
is Southgates.

1:01:27.142 --> 1:01:29.937
(Buckley) Well, if
the Herrick map is accurate...

1:01:30.020 --> 1:01:31.188
(Mathew) And to scale.

1:01:31.271 --> 1:01:33.941
(Buckley) ...whatever it is
in Herrick's garden

1:01:34.024 --> 1:01:37.611
is now right in the middle of
the social services car park.

1:01:47.746 --> 1:01:49.623
It's still an open space.

1:01:54.044 --> 1:01:55.963
Perhaps we should start
looking there.

1:01:56.964 --> 1:01:58.257
For Greyfriars.

1:02:00.843 --> 1:02:03.220
If we're saying this
is about finding the church,

1:02:03.303 --> 1:02:06.640
then on that basis... I'm in.

1:02:08.684 --> 1:02:09.852
Thank you.

1:02:09.935 --> 1:02:13.647
-(Buckley) It won't be cheap.
-I'll raise the funds.

1:02:13.730 --> 1:02:15.482
You need the council
to help with that

1:02:15.566 --> 1:02:18.026
-and with all the permits.
-(Mathew) I'll help.

1:02:18.986 --> 1:02:20.237
I know.

1:02:31.957 --> 1:02:34.751
I'm Sarah Levitt and I'm Head
of Arts and Museums

1:02:34.835 --> 1:02:36.545
for Leicester City Council.

1:02:36.628 --> 1:02:38.046
And now Philippa is here

1:02:38.130 --> 1:02:40.632
to answer any queries
that we may have.

1:02:40.716 --> 1:02:41.758
Thank you.

1:02:41.842 --> 1:02:44.011
Philippa. Martin Peters.

1:02:44.094 --> 1:02:46.430
I run an organisation
which promotes Leicestershire.

1:02:46.513 --> 1:02:49.850
-Hi.
-What's your funding plan?

1:02:49.933 --> 1:02:53.645
Well, I wanted to put it out to
a number of interested parties,

1:02:53.729 --> 1:02:55.105
including yourself.

1:02:55.189 --> 1:02:57.774
Erm, the council,
Leicester University.

1:02:57.858 --> 1:02:59.860
And then hopefully
make up any shortfall

1:02:59.943 --> 1:03:02.237
by pitching it
to potential sponsors.

1:03:03.280 --> 1:03:04.740
Richard Taylor, Leicester Uni.

1:03:04.823 --> 1:03:07.201
Now, we, potentially,

1:03:07.284 --> 1:03:09.536
might have some funding
we could put in.

1:03:09.620 --> 1:03:13.874
But I'm concerned
about your costs.

1:03:14.791 --> 1:03:17.002
I mean,
radar survey of the site.

1:03:17.085 --> 1:03:19.129
Digging up the car park.

1:03:19.213 --> 1:03:21.465
Paying
for everyone's car parking

1:03:21.548 --> 1:03:22.966
whilst the dig
is being carried out.

1:03:23.050 --> 1:03:24.551
Reinstating the car park.

1:03:24.635 --> 1:03:27.179
I mean... What is your budget?

1:03:27.262 --> 1:03:28.847
Forty, 50K?

1:03:28.931 --> 1:03:30.682
Thirty-five.

1:03:32.100 --> 1:03:33.185
And the rest?

1:03:33.268 --> 1:03:35.479
The thing is, we don't know

1:03:35.562 --> 1:03:39.191
how long the car park will
remain just that, a car park.

1:03:39.274 --> 1:03:40.317
There are rumours

1:03:40.400 --> 1:03:42.819
that the site might be sold
and redeveloped.

1:03:42.903 --> 1:03:45.572
And then that chance
is gone forever.

1:03:46.907 --> 1:03:51.995
I... I believe that this is a
very important historical site.

1:03:53.205 --> 1:03:56.250
I've the strongest feeling
about this.

1:03:57.918 --> 1:04:00.671
You see, for me,
a feeling is what you get

1:04:00.754 --> 1:04:02.798
when you sit on a bus seat
that's still warm.

1:04:02.881 --> 1:04:04.716
(chuckles quietly)

1:04:04.800 --> 1:04:08.554
Supposing, against all the odds,
that you do find a body,

1:04:08.637 --> 1:04:12.641
that you believe to be that
of Richard III,

1:04:12.724 --> 1:04:15.227
how can you possibly prove
that it's him?

1:04:15.310 --> 1:04:16.311
Well, actually...

1:04:16.395 --> 1:04:17.854
Because it's got
all the hallmarks

1:04:17.938 --> 1:04:19.231
of being a wild-goose chase.

1:04:19.314 --> 1:04:21.942
If you could just let
Philippa answer.

1:04:22.025 --> 1:04:23.193
(Philippa) Thank you.

1:04:24.403 --> 1:04:28.323
Actually, erm,
the historian John Ashdown-Hill

1:04:28.407 --> 1:04:31.493
has traced living descendants
of Richard's

1:04:32.411 --> 1:04:33.662
back through 500 years

1:04:33.745 --> 1:04:35.706
of the female mitochondrial
DNA line.

1:04:35.789 --> 1:04:41.336
So... a simple DNA test
would establish definitively

1:04:41.420 --> 1:04:43.046
whether any remains were his.

1:04:44.590 --> 1:04:47.884
Any other questions? No?

1:04:47.968 --> 1:04:49.386
Thank you, Philippa.

1:04:49.469 --> 1:04:50.887
If you'd like to wait
downstairs,

1:04:50.971 --> 1:04:52.180
we'll discuss this further.

1:04:52.264 --> 1:04:53.515
Sure. Thank you.

1:05:00.814 --> 1:05:02.107
Thank you so much.

1:05:08.030 --> 1:05:10.198
Now, I'm sure this woman
means well,

1:05:10.282 --> 1:05:11.700
but it's important
to acknowledge

1:05:11.783 --> 1:05:13.410
that she's an amateur.

1:05:13.493 --> 1:05:15.037
And she has
an emotional dynamic

1:05:15.120 --> 1:05:17.039
which I don't think
is very helpful.

1:05:18.081 --> 1:05:21.168
My concern is for the reputation
of the university,

1:05:21.251 --> 1:05:23.170
should this whole thing
become a fiasco.

1:05:23.253 --> 1:05:29.301
Huh! I mean, Richard III,
under a car park. (chuckles)

1:05:37.684 --> 1:05:41.229
-Hi.
-Hi. (clears throat)

1:05:41.313 --> 1:05:43.106
It's been approved.
Congratulations.

1:05:43.190 --> 1:05:44.399
-What? No!
-Yes.

1:05:44.483 --> 1:05:45.609
-No!
-Yes.

1:05:45.692 --> 1:05:47.819
Oh, and you are also
fully funded.

1:05:47.903 --> 1:05:50.781
Martin Peters from
Leicestershire Promotions

1:05:50.864 --> 1:05:52.532
has agreed to give you
the full 35K.

1:05:52.616 --> 1:05:54.868
He thinks the publicity
would be great for the city,

1:05:54.951 --> 1:05:56.662
-and I agree.
-Oh, my goodness.

1:05:56.745 --> 1:05:58.372
Oh, thank you so much.

1:05:58.455 --> 1:06:00.332
Now, can I give you
a piece of advice?

1:06:00.415 --> 1:06:01.667
Of course, yes.

1:06:01.750 --> 1:06:03.835
Please don't mention
your feelings again.

1:06:04.753 --> 1:06:05.796
Right, yes, of course.

1:06:05.879 --> 1:06:07.005
-I keep doing that.
-Yes.

1:06:07.089 --> 1:06:09.299
People love to use that
as a stick to beat you with.

1:06:09.383 --> 1:06:12.427
-Especially if you're a woman.
-Of course. Thank you so much.

1:06:12.511 --> 1:06:14.971
This is the equivalent of
someone with a homemade rocket

1:06:15.055 --> 1:06:16.682
saying they're gonna reach
the moon.

1:06:16.765 --> 1:06:18.266
That's how we should
look at this.

1:06:18.350 --> 1:06:21.561
Be hilarious if she actually
found him though, wouldn't it?

1:06:21.645 --> 1:06:24.940
Would it? Be hilarious?

1:06:33.573 --> 1:06:35.826
-Hello.
-She seemed nice.

1:06:35.909 --> 1:06:38.578
Sarah? Yeah, she is. Very.

1:06:39.413 --> 1:06:40.414
Erm...

1:06:43.375 --> 1:06:45.377
I didn't think I was gonna
see you again

1:06:45.460 --> 1:06:48.797
after, you know,
the other night.

1:06:50.465 --> 1:06:54.386
I'm sorry, I... I mean,
I know it's a touchy subject.

1:06:56.388 --> 1:06:59.099
I believe you, by the way.

1:07:00.142 --> 1:07:03.562
I definitely don't think
you did... kill them.

1:07:06.022 --> 1:07:07.649
Just to clear that up.

1:07:09.109 --> 1:07:11.778
I thought you were really
impressive with those people.

1:07:15.115 --> 1:07:16.408
Thank you.

1:07:20.787 --> 1:07:22.456
(Philippa) Exciting, isn't it?

1:07:22.539 --> 1:07:25.625
(Buckley) I think it's a waste
of money. In my experience,

1:07:25.709 --> 1:07:29.379
you hardly ever get anything
definitive from radar surveys.

1:07:29.463 --> 1:07:31.047
(machine beeps)

1:07:48.231 --> 1:07:51.109
Results from the radar survey.
All negative.

1:07:51.193 --> 1:07:53.153
Well, that can't be right.

1:07:53.236 --> 1:07:54.946
They didn't spot anything, John.

1:07:55.030 --> 1:07:58.074
There's no walls,
no foundation, no graves.

1:07:58.158 --> 1:08:00.410
There must've been something
there before the car park.

1:08:00.494 --> 1:08:03.079
There's no way they'll let me
go ahead with the dig now.

1:08:03.914 --> 1:08:05.707
What does Richard say?

1:08:10.128 --> 1:08:11.296
-Richard?
-Hmm.

1:08:11.379 --> 1:08:14.257
-Why don't you ask his opinion?
-He doesn't mean me.

1:08:16.718 --> 1:08:18.553
-Buckley?
-(John) Hmm.

1:08:18.637 --> 1:08:20.263
Richard Buckley,
yes, of course.

1:08:20.972 --> 1:08:22.265
I did warn you.

1:08:23.141 --> 1:08:24.768
(Philippa) Yes, I know. I know.

1:08:24.851 --> 1:08:26.478
But what do we do now?

1:08:26.561 --> 1:08:29.064
Well, have you spoken
to Sarah Levitt this morning?

1:08:29.147 --> 1:08:30.398
No. Why?

1:08:30.482 --> 1:08:33.652
More bad news, I'm afraid.

1:08:33.735 --> 1:08:36.404
Leicestershire Promotions
have pulled out.

1:08:36.488 --> 1:08:37.989
(gasps)

1:08:38.657 --> 1:08:40.158
But that's all our funding.

1:08:40.242 --> 1:08:43.870
Sarah did say the council
will still support you for now,

1:08:43.954 --> 1:08:47.207
but you're gonna need to raise
new finance very quickly.

1:08:47.290 --> 1:08:49.292
Well, what about
Leicester University?

1:08:49.376 --> 1:08:51.586
Surely with you involved,
they can't just ignore me?

1:08:51.670 --> 1:08:54.673
Leicester University is not
a benevolent seat of learning.

1:08:54.756 --> 1:08:55.799
It's a business.

1:08:56.842 --> 1:08:59.386
And they've recently
dispensed with my services.

1:08:59.469 --> 1:09:03.056
Oh, Richard, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea. I...

1:09:04.391 --> 1:09:07.102
Have faith in your research,
Philippa.

1:09:08.436 --> 1:09:10.564
Have faith in yourself.

1:09:11.815 --> 1:09:15.026
If you're asking if
I'm still in, the answer's yes.

1:09:17.028 --> 1:09:18.405
Thank you. Thank you, Richard.

1:09:20.031 --> 1:09:21.283
Yes, bye.

1:09:26.705 --> 1:09:28.415
Hooray for Richard Buckley.

1:09:29.624 --> 1:09:31.710
At least he hasn't
abandoned us.

1:09:32.460 --> 1:09:34.796
-What about the funds you need?
-I don't know, really.

1:09:34.880 --> 1:09:37.007
I... suppose
I'll have to think of something.

1:09:38.174 --> 1:09:40.677
The main thing is that
they haven't closed us down.

1:09:42.262 --> 1:09:43.555
Completely.

1:09:45.098 --> 1:09:47.058
-Dad?
-Yes, Raife?

1:09:47.976 --> 1:09:49.936
Mum talks to herself.

1:09:52.939 --> 1:09:54.983
Well, we all do.

1:09:58.820 --> 1:10:02.407
Er, a few blisters, but, er...

1:10:03.658 --> 1:10:06.411
-Well?
-He's asking too much for it.

1:10:06.494 --> 1:10:09.581
What you wanna do
is go in at £3,750.

1:10:09.664 --> 1:10:14.669
Tell him four's your top offer,
and settle for £4,250.

1:10:15.545 --> 1:10:17.422
-Agreed.
-Agreed.

1:10:17.505 --> 1:10:19.132
-Hi, Mum.
-Mum!

1:10:19.215 --> 1:10:21.468
-Hello, darlings.
-Any luck?

1:10:21.551 --> 1:10:25.221
Erm, managed to claw back £5,000
from Leicestershire Promotions.

1:10:25.305 --> 1:10:27.223
-But that's about it.
-Oh, that's... good.

1:10:27.307 --> 1:10:28.934
Suddenly everyone's
got cold feet.

1:10:29.017 --> 1:10:30.644
-Mum!
-I don't quite know what to do.

1:10:30.727 --> 1:10:33.688
-Yes, darling?
-(John) OK, well, look. Not now.

1:10:33.772 --> 1:10:35.857
Perhaps it's, you know,
an opportunity

1:10:35.941 --> 1:10:38.818
-to take stock of everything.
-What do you mean?

1:10:38.902 --> 1:10:41.488
Well, you know, I don't plan
on spending the rest of my life

1:10:41.571 --> 1:10:43.573
-sleeping on a sofa.
-Mum.

1:10:43.657 --> 1:10:46.117
-Yes?
-Dad's getting a new car!

1:10:46.201 --> 1:10:48.703
-Is he really? Very nice.
-(doorbell rings)

1:10:48.787 --> 1:10:49.913
Perhaps he can drop you

1:10:49.996 --> 1:10:52.082
right in front of the school
now, can't he? Hmm?

1:10:52.165 --> 1:10:54.542
(doorbell rings)

1:10:54.626 --> 1:10:57.003
She hasn't made us
any dinner again.

1:10:57.087 --> 1:10:59.381
-It's disgraceful.
-Shut up, Raife.

1:10:59.464 --> 1:11:00.590
Yeah, shut up, Raife.

1:11:00.674 --> 1:11:02.509
(John) Come on, let's go
into town, get a bite.

1:11:02.592 --> 1:11:05.470
-Come on through.
-Get out of her hair.

1:11:05.553 --> 1:11:07.806
Everybody, this is,
erm, Annette, Hamish

1:11:07.889 --> 1:11:09.766
from the society. Max and Raife.

1:11:09.849 --> 1:11:12.394
And this is my, erm...
Well, this is John.

1:11:12.477 --> 1:11:13.520
-Ex-husband.
-Yeah.

1:11:13.603 --> 1:11:15.313
What are you doing?
Are you coming, going?

1:11:15.397 --> 1:11:17.065
We're gonna go into town,
get a bite.

1:11:17.148 --> 1:11:18.483
(Philippa) Quick as you can.

1:11:18.566 --> 1:11:20.694
We will stay out
as long as is humanly possible.

1:11:20.777 --> 1:11:22.445
Take your time. Come through.

1:11:22.529 --> 1:11:23.863
(Raife) If I had two sons,

1:11:23.947 --> 1:11:25.949
I would make sure
they had something to eat

1:11:26.032 --> 1:11:28.243
before I went looking
for Richard III.

1:11:29.411 --> 1:11:30.745
(John sighs)

1:11:31.871 --> 1:11:33.873
I'm wondering now
if we make a direct appeal

1:11:33.957 --> 1:11:36.584
to the Ricardians
to raise some funds for the dig.

1:11:36.668 --> 1:11:39.379
-A crowd fund.
-Yes, exactly that.

1:11:40.088 --> 1:11:42.132
Er, what do you want
to call it?

1:11:42.215 --> 1:11:44.968
Oh, I couldn't decide
between Digging the King

1:11:45.051 --> 1:11:46.636
because it works on two levels.

1:11:46.720 --> 1:11:50.557
We are actually digging for him
and also want people to...

1:11:51.766 --> 1:11:52.892
"dig" Richard.

1:11:52.976 --> 1:11:56.062
Yeah, I-I got that.
What's the other title?

1:11:56.813 --> 1:11:59.607
-Looking for Richard Project.
-(both) Call it that.

1:12:00.108 --> 1:12:01.192
Right.

1:12:05.655 --> 1:12:08.033
Should that be "sudden
and unexpected shortfall"?

1:12:08.116 --> 1:12:09.284
-Hmm.
-OK.

1:12:09.367 --> 1:12:10.869
That's good.

1:12:14.372 --> 1:12:16.624
-Happy?
-I think so.

1:12:16.708 --> 1:12:19.169
Certainly better
than what I had.

1:12:19.252 --> 1:12:21.087
-Send?
-Yeah.

1:12:22.922 --> 1:12:24.549
-(laptop chimes)
-(Hamish) That's it.

1:12:24.632 --> 1:12:26.885
Three and half thousand
society members.

1:12:26.968 --> 1:12:30.221
If everyone sends in a pound,
be a good start, wouldn't it?

1:12:30.305 --> 1:12:32.640
I'd say. Thank you so much.

1:12:45.236 --> 1:12:47.447
(couch creaks)

1:12:50.742 --> 1:12:51.868
(sighs)

1:12:55.622 --> 1:12:57.165
(phone buzzes)

1:13:06.716 --> 1:13:08.009
(phone buzzes)

1:13:14.099 --> 1:13:15.642
(phone buzzes)

1:13:26.528 --> 1:13:27.904
(sighs)

1:13:30.031 --> 1:13:31.491
(phone buzzes)

1:13:31.574 --> 1:13:33.827
There are still emails
coming in from America,

1:13:33.910 --> 1:13:38.373
Australia, South Africa,
Germany, Canada, Brazil.

1:13:38.456 --> 1:13:40.333
So, how much has been pledged?

1:13:40.416 --> 1:13:44.087
Oh, well, the current total is,
er...

1:13:45.213 --> 1:13:48.091
£26,374 and rising.

1:13:48.174 --> 1:13:49.467
I can't believe it.

1:13:49.551 --> 1:13:52.512
Our own chairman has
donated £5,000 all by himself.

1:13:52.595 --> 1:13:53.763
-Phil Stone?
-Yeah.

1:13:53.847 --> 1:13:56.474
And another £2,000
from an anonymous source.

1:13:57.433 --> 1:14:00.103
People have been so generous,
it's overwhelming.

1:14:01.146 --> 1:14:02.814
I think it's gonna happen.

1:14:12.282 --> 1:14:14.659
(woman) Can we keep this clear,
please?

1:14:15.493 --> 1:14:16.870
(man) Over here, please.

1:14:27.130 --> 1:14:28.882
Oh, very patriotic.

1:14:46.733 --> 1:14:48.151
-Right.
-Thank you.

1:14:48.234 --> 1:14:49.611
-Good luck.
-Thank you very much.

1:14:49.694 --> 1:14:50.778
I'll need it.

1:14:52.155 --> 1:14:54.324
(tannoy) The train
now standing at platform three

1:14:54.407 --> 1:14:57.535
is the 10:25 service
to Inverness.

1:14:57.619 --> 1:15:02.874
Calling at Haymarket,
Falkirk, Stirling, Dunblane,

1:15:02.957 --> 1:15:06.586
Gleneagles, Perth, Dunkeld,

1:15:06.669 --> 1:15:09.130
Pitlochry, Blair Atholl...

1:15:11.341 --> 1:15:12.884
What's wrong?

1:15:18.556 --> 1:15:20.099
Where's the new car?

1:15:21.226 --> 1:15:23.269
The boys said
you were getting a new car.

1:15:24.020 --> 1:15:25.730
What?

1:15:25.813 --> 1:15:27.232
It was you, wasn't it?

1:15:28.274 --> 1:15:30.860
Two thousand pounds
for the appeal.

1:15:30.944 --> 1:15:32.570
It was the boys' idea.

1:15:32.654 --> 1:15:34.072
They insisted.

1:15:39.953 --> 1:15:41.537
You're a good man, John.

1:15:42.914 --> 1:15:44.499
Hmm. That's fair.

1:16:00.640 --> 1:16:02.600
Hi, Richard. What's happening?

1:16:02.684 --> 1:16:05.895
As we discussed, three trenches.
Maximum the budget will allow.

1:16:05.979 --> 1:16:07.814
And in order to give ourselves
the best chance

1:16:07.897 --> 1:16:10.316
of finding
one of the walls of Greyfriars,

1:16:10.400 --> 1:16:12.110
I'm gonna cut them
north to south.

1:16:12.193 --> 1:16:15.613
Here. One there.
And another one over there.

1:16:15.697 --> 1:16:18.199
-Trench one will start here.
-OK.

1:16:18.283 --> 1:16:21.577
And run all the way
down this way

1:16:21.661 --> 1:16:25.331
to round about here.

1:16:25.415 --> 1:16:27.375
-To about here?
-That's right, yeah.

1:16:27.458 --> 1:16:29.294
Ooh, by the way,
I meant to tell you,

1:16:29.377 --> 1:16:31.212
I signed the exhumation licence.

1:16:31.296 --> 1:16:33.840
The paperwork arrived
at the office this morning.

1:16:33.923 --> 1:16:36.009
I couldn't remember
if you had any comments.

1:16:36.092 --> 1:16:37.844
I just wanted to get it
out of the way.

1:16:37.927 --> 1:16:40.096
Saves a lot of fannying around.

1:16:40.179 --> 1:16:43.057
Course, it's not an issue
unless we find him.

1:16:43.141 --> 1:16:45.643
Er, does it matter
what end we start at?

1:16:46.978 --> 1:16:49.355
Er... no.

1:16:49.439 --> 1:16:51.899
Can we start at this end,
do you think?

1:16:51.983 --> 1:16:54.902
-Any particular reason?
-No.

1:16:55.820 --> 1:16:57.322
-OK.
-Great.

1:16:57.405 --> 1:17:00.074
-Groovy wellies.
-Thanks.

1:17:03.286 --> 1:17:05.288
(saw whirs)

1:17:16.758 --> 1:17:18.760
(cheering)

1:17:29.604 --> 1:17:31.898
(saw whirs)

1:17:58.257 --> 1:17:59.634
Philippa.

1:18:00.343 --> 1:18:01.636
John!

1:18:02.470 --> 1:18:04.430
So glad you could make it!

1:18:04.514 --> 1:18:06.766
-Who's that fellow over there?
-What?

1:18:08.226 --> 1:18:10.436
Oh, that's, erm...
that's Richard Taylor.

1:18:10.520 --> 1:18:13.689
He's from Leicester University.
Why?

1:18:13.773 --> 1:18:16.359
I rather thought you were the
driving force behind this dig,

1:18:16.442 --> 1:18:18.069
but from what I could hear,

1:18:18.152 --> 1:18:20.530
apparently, it's all down
to the university.

1:18:20.613 --> 1:18:21.948
What?

1:18:22.031 --> 1:18:24.033
We're very excited
about what we might find.

1:18:24.117 --> 1:18:25.535
Very excited.

1:18:25.618 --> 1:18:28.746
And so, with the university
leading the search,

1:18:28.830 --> 1:18:32.041
we can say with confidence
that if he's out there,

1:18:32.125 --> 1:18:33.918
we will find him.

1:18:34.585 --> 1:18:35.711
-Richard.
-OK?

1:18:35.795 --> 1:18:37.213
-(reporter) That's great.
-Good.

1:18:37.296 --> 1:18:39.006
-(reporter) Thank you.
-What's going on?

1:18:39.090 --> 1:18:41.342
Just a little interview
for the university website.

1:18:41.426 --> 1:18:45.430
Erm, Leicester Uni isn't leading
the search for Richard. I am.

1:18:46.848 --> 1:18:49.267
You put in a little bit of
funding right at the last minute

1:18:49.350 --> 1:18:51.352
-and that's it.
-Come on now, Philippa.

1:18:51.436 --> 1:18:53.938
-We're all in this together.
-(Buckley) Philippa.

1:18:56.232 --> 1:18:58.151
-Excuse me.
-Hm-hmm.

1:18:59.318 --> 1:19:01.404
Someone getting too big
for their fancy boots.

1:19:01.487 --> 1:19:02.488
(Philippa) What is it?

1:19:02.572 --> 1:19:04.574
(Buckley) Philippa,
we've found some leg bones.

1:19:04.657 --> 1:19:06.242
-Leg bones?
-No feet with them.

1:19:06.325 --> 1:19:08.536
Just the lower legs
sticking out into the trench.

1:19:08.619 --> 1:19:10.371
(Buckley)
Looks like the feet were cut off

1:19:10.455 --> 1:19:12.498
when they dug down
to put in sewage pipes

1:19:12.582 --> 1:19:14.000
a couple of hundred years ago.

1:19:14.083 --> 1:19:15.543
What about the rest
of the body?

1:19:15.626 --> 1:19:17.503
(Buckley) Well,
if it's a complete burial,

1:19:17.587 --> 1:19:20.006
it's under there
outside the trench.

1:19:20.089 --> 1:19:23.092
It's almost certain this whole
area is outside the church,

1:19:23.176 --> 1:19:25.178
which is our focus, remember?

1:19:25.261 --> 1:19:29.557
Probably a friar buried
in a little adjoining graveyard.

1:19:29.640 --> 1:19:31.100
Given the budget constraints

1:19:31.184 --> 1:19:33.436
we're not gonna waste time
and money digging it out,

1:19:33.519 --> 1:19:35.146
but, er, not a bad start, eh?

1:19:35.229 --> 1:19:38.024
(thunder)

1:19:48.409 --> 1:19:50.411
(thunder)

1:20:32.662 --> 1:20:33.955
What's the matter?

1:20:37.124 --> 1:20:38.501
I'm worried.

1:20:39.669 --> 1:20:40.878
What about?

1:20:42.630 --> 1:20:44.423
I won't find you.

1:20:50.513 --> 1:20:51.806
Or that I will.

1:20:54.767 --> 1:20:56.978
There seems to be
some excitement this morning.

1:20:57.061 --> 1:20:59.689
Yes, we found the shadow
of a stone wall,

1:20:59.772 --> 1:21:02.066
which could be the cloister
wall of Greyfriars Church

1:21:02.149 --> 1:21:03.651
in this trench here.

1:21:03.734 --> 1:21:06.195
And once we work out
the geography of the church,

1:21:06.279 --> 1:21:07.947
we need to find the choir,

1:21:08.030 --> 1:21:11.534
because that's where they buried
important people, apparently.

1:21:11.617 --> 1:21:15.663
I also believe that the bones
we found in trench one

1:21:15.746 --> 1:21:18.082
could be very significant here.

1:21:19.792 --> 1:21:23.087
-(Philippa) I'm so fed up.
-You're the client, Philippa.

1:21:23.170 --> 1:21:25.298
You're entitled to ask
for whatever you want.

1:21:25.381 --> 1:21:28.092
They never miss a chance
to put me in my place.

1:21:28.175 --> 1:21:30.011
It's exhausting.

1:21:30.094 --> 1:21:32.263
Don't let them push you around.

1:21:32.346 --> 1:21:33.681
I'll try my best.

1:21:33.764 --> 1:21:35.057
Thanks, John.

1:21:35.141 --> 1:21:36.767
We're all thinking of you here.

1:21:36.851 --> 1:21:39.145
Stay strong and chin up, eh?
Bye-bye.

1:21:39.228 --> 1:21:40.354
Bye, love.

1:21:47.778 --> 1:21:50.448
This looks really promising.

1:21:51.991 --> 1:21:55.620
I think this trench cuts across
the east end of the church.

1:21:55.703 --> 1:21:58.539
So we are pretty close
to the choir here.

1:21:58.623 --> 1:22:01.250
If we keep working
in this direction,

1:22:01.334 --> 1:22:02.793
-give it another...
-Richard.

1:22:03.919 --> 1:22:07.256
-Can I have a word, please?
-Of course.

1:22:07.340 --> 1:22:09.258
I want to exhume
the rest of the remains

1:22:09.342 --> 1:22:10.885
in trench one, please.

1:22:10.968 --> 1:22:12.345
Philippa, I've already told you,

1:22:12.428 --> 1:22:14.889
those are almost certainly
the remains of a friar.

1:22:14.972 --> 1:22:17.266
I don't think there's
any doubt about it, Richard.

1:22:17.350 --> 1:22:19.185
The depth they're buried at,

1:22:19.268 --> 1:22:21.145
and they're too far west
to be in the choir.

1:22:21.228 --> 1:22:23.773
-I agree.
-I want to dig him up, please.

1:22:23.856 --> 1:22:25.316
I've stuck my neck out for you

1:22:25.399 --> 1:22:29.487
because till now, I felt your
research was sound and thorough.

1:22:29.570 --> 1:22:30.780
I think it's him.

1:22:30.863 --> 1:22:33.282
Don't you think you've become
fixated on these bones

1:22:33.366 --> 1:22:36.494
just because they were
the first ones we discovered?

1:22:36.577 --> 1:22:40.539
What if that is part
of the choir, hmm? Over there?

1:22:40.623 --> 1:22:42.541
What if you're wrong
and it is him?

1:22:42.625 --> 1:22:44.710
Myself and all
the professionals,

1:22:44.794 --> 1:22:46.379
the assembled academics

1:22:46.462 --> 1:22:48.798
all say concentrate here
in trench three,

1:22:48.881 --> 1:22:51.092
but you say, "No,
let's concentrate over there,"

1:22:51.175 --> 1:22:54.220
because that's where you think
he is. Do you see my problem?

1:22:54.303 --> 1:22:56.430
I want to exhume
the rest of those bones!

1:22:56.514 --> 1:22:58.099
We can't.
We don't have the money to!

1:22:58.182 --> 1:23:02.103
I've got about £800 left
in the fund. Will that cover it?

1:23:06.232 --> 1:23:07.316
I suppose so.

1:23:07.400 --> 1:23:10.361
Well, can you just do it then?
Please.

1:23:16.283 --> 1:23:18.077
Jo, dig out the remains
in trench one.

1:23:18.160 --> 1:23:19.995
-Really?
-Yes, really.

1:23:20.079 --> 1:23:22.540
She's paying for it.
Let's give her what she wants.

1:23:22.623 --> 1:23:24.125
I'm going home.

1:23:41.892 --> 1:23:43.728
(Philippa) I can't bear it.

1:23:46.981 --> 1:23:48.607
I'm going for a walk.

1:24:29.482 --> 1:24:31.025
Fancy a brew, Jo?

1:24:35.154 --> 1:24:36.655
Hello, Jo?

1:24:47.750 --> 1:24:49.084
(sighs)

1:24:52.296 --> 1:24:54.757
(horse snorts)

1:24:54.840 --> 1:24:56.592
(phone buzzes)

1:25:00.930 --> 1:25:02.765
(gasps)

1:25:05.601 --> 1:25:07.311
(horse whinnies)

1:25:09.939 --> 1:25:11.357
(gasps)

1:25:24.703 --> 1:25:25.746
Wait.

1:25:33.671 --> 1:25:34.755
Wait!

1:26:22.094 --> 1:26:24.263
(breathes heavily)

1:26:50.164 --> 1:26:52.541
There's a wound to the skull.

1:26:52.625 --> 1:26:54.293
It's not visible
from the surface,

1:26:54.376 --> 1:26:57.046
but when you turn it over,
you can see a slicing blow

1:26:57.129 --> 1:26:59.173
that has taken
some skull with it.

1:26:59.256 --> 1:27:01.300
It would have killed him
almost instantly.

1:27:01.383 --> 1:27:03.802
"Killed the boar,
shaved his head."

1:27:03.886 --> 1:27:05.512
That's a Welsh poet's
description

1:27:05.596 --> 1:27:08.140
of the death of Richard
from the 15th century.

1:27:08.849 --> 1:27:10.976
Richard's personal emblem
was a boar.

1:27:12.102 --> 1:27:15.105
It's the body of an adult male,

1:27:15.189 --> 1:27:18.275
aged somewhere between
20 and 40.

1:27:18.359 --> 1:27:19.985
Richard was 32.

1:27:20.069 --> 1:27:22.112
(Jo) But there's something else.

1:27:24.531 --> 1:27:27.076
I've just been excavating
the spinal column,

1:27:27.159 --> 1:27:31.914
and if you look at it
along here, it's unmistakable.

1:27:32.831 --> 1:27:35.751
There's an abnormal curvature.

1:27:38.921 --> 1:27:40.089
Hello.

1:27:44.134 --> 1:27:47.012
(Jo) These remains
are those of a hunchback.

1:27:51.809 --> 1:27:54.269
Tudor apologists
will have a field day.

1:27:57.773 --> 1:27:59.316
It doesn't matter.

1:28:02.778 --> 1:28:04.113
He's perfect.

1:28:48.574 --> 1:28:50.451
(woman) They're calling you
from the dig.

1:28:51.410 --> 1:28:53.162
They're saying to tell you...

1:28:54.705 --> 1:28:57.458
trauma to the skull
and a curved spine.

1:28:59.376 --> 1:29:01.295
(dog barks)

1:29:04.923 --> 1:29:06.592
(tyres screech)

1:29:13.348 --> 1:29:15.684
Of course, it's not certain
that this is Richard.

1:29:15.768 --> 1:29:18.729
There are still DNA tests
and so forth to be carried out.

1:29:18.812 --> 1:29:22.232
But I'm struck peering down
at the mortal remains

1:29:22.316 --> 1:29:25.778
that this is a person,
a father, a brother, a son.

1:29:25.861 --> 1:29:27.821
Philippa, could we
have a word with you?

1:29:27.905 --> 1:29:29.698
-Yes, of course. Erm...
-(phone rings)

1:29:29.782 --> 1:29:32.826
Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry.
Hold on, erm...

1:29:33.911 --> 1:29:35.954
I've really got to take this.
I'm sorry, John.

1:29:36.038 --> 1:29:37.247
Anything to add, sir?

1:29:37.331 --> 1:29:39.041
It's a testimony
to the research...

1:29:39.124 --> 1:29:40.626
-John?
-Hey.

1:29:40.709 --> 1:29:43.253
I just wondered how everything
was going.

1:29:43.337 --> 1:29:45.339
John, you're not
gonna believe this.

1:29:45.422 --> 1:29:47.800
Where the hell is Buckley?

1:29:51.553 --> 1:29:52.763
Found him.

1:29:54.223 --> 1:29:55.849
(crowd noise on video game)

1:29:56.850 --> 1:29:58.769
-Boys. Boys! Boys.
-What are you doing?

1:29:58.852 --> 1:30:01.605
Your mum, your mother's
just found Richard III.

1:30:01.688 --> 1:30:04.566
-Kingfinder!
-Yeah!

1:30:04.650 --> 1:30:06.026
(boys cheer)

1:30:06.110 --> 1:30:07.861
(Max) Yes, Mum!
I knew you could do it!

1:30:07.945 --> 1:30:09.488
(Raife) Well done, Mum!

1:30:09.571 --> 1:30:10.948
Listen, I've got to go.

1:30:11.031 --> 1:30:13.408
-I love you lots, all of you.
-(Max) Love you too.

1:30:13.492 --> 1:30:15.369
Very much.

1:30:18.205 --> 1:30:19.748
He's here. He's here.

1:30:25.462 --> 1:30:28.632
-Where were you?
-I was... busy.

1:30:28.715 --> 1:30:30.050
Is it definitely him?

1:30:30.134 --> 1:30:31.969
Well, I don't think
there's any doubt.

1:30:32.052 --> 1:30:34.638
You've bloody missed it all.
We're playing catch-up now.

1:30:34.721 --> 1:30:36.557
Vice Chancellor's here.
Vice Chancellor.

1:30:36.640 --> 1:30:38.016
-Could you just...?
-Oh, yeah.

1:30:38.100 --> 1:30:39.560
What do you mean, "we"?

1:30:39.643 --> 1:30:42.187
The university
withdrew my funding.

1:30:42.271 --> 1:30:44.648
It's a very fluid situation.

1:30:44.731 --> 1:30:47.192
-Mr Burgess.
-Things can change very rapidly.

1:30:47.276 --> 1:30:49.111
Are  changing very rapidly.

1:30:50.487 --> 1:30:53.115
Will  change. Mr Burgess.

1:30:53.198 --> 1:30:55.450
Philippa!
I just can't believe it!

1:30:55.534 --> 1:30:58.704
He was right where
I said he'd be, in trench one.

1:30:58.787 --> 1:31:00.747
-You went with your feelings?
-I did.

1:31:00.831 --> 1:31:02.833
Oh, God!

1:31:02.916 --> 1:31:04.459
Thank you!

1:31:04.543 --> 1:31:05.752
Who's that?

1:31:05.836 --> 1:31:07.462
(sighs)
Right, that's Bob Burgess.

1:31:07.546 --> 1:31:08.797
He's the Vice Chancellor.

1:31:08.881 --> 1:31:11.300
The university have got their
big guns here double quick.

1:31:11.383 --> 1:31:12.467
That's nice.

1:31:12.551 --> 1:31:14.970
...Archaeology Department,
the University of Leicester.

1:31:15.053 --> 1:31:16.805
Look, you have no idea
the impact

1:31:16.889 --> 1:31:18.932
that this is gonna
have on the city!

1:31:19.016 --> 1:31:21.685
...how he famously promised
his kingdom for a horse.

1:31:21.768 --> 1:31:24.521
But what happened to
the body of King Richard III

1:31:24.605 --> 1:31:26.315
after his defeat at
the Battle of Bosworth

1:31:26.398 --> 1:31:28.567
has remained a mystery
for more than 500 years.

1:31:28.650 --> 1:31:30.527
Until now. Maybe.

1:31:30.611 --> 1:31:33.488
(speaks Russian)

1:31:33.572 --> 1:31:36.116
(speaks Italian)

1:31:36.575 --> 1:31:38.744
They believe they've uncovered
the remains

1:31:38.827 --> 1:31:40.370
of long-lost royalty.

1:31:40.454 --> 1:31:42.956
He happens to be
King Richard III.

1:31:54.468 --> 1:31:58.430
-Richard. Hi.
-Philippa. Hi. Excited?

1:31:58.513 --> 1:31:59.556
Nervous.

1:31:59.640 --> 1:32:01.975
So how's it gonna work today?
Who says what?

1:32:02.059 --> 1:32:05.187
Leicester Uni have a whole
running order worked out.

1:32:05.270 --> 1:32:07.356
-Did they not consult you?
-No.

1:32:08.732 --> 1:32:10.025
So who's chairing it?

1:32:12.486 --> 1:32:14.112
-What?
-We'd better get inside.

1:32:22.454 --> 1:32:25.916
(Taylor) Having received the
results of the DNA analysis,

1:32:25.999 --> 1:32:28.460
I now call upon Richard Buckley,

1:32:28.543 --> 1:32:31.088
the lead archaeologist
of this project,

1:32:31.171 --> 1:32:34.841
to deliver today's
astonishing announcement

1:32:34.925 --> 1:32:38.428
from the University
of Leicester. Thank you.

1:32:40.180 --> 1:32:41.640
(clears throat)

1:32:41.723 --> 1:32:45.936
The glare of worldwide publicity
has not detracted in any way

1:32:46.019 --> 1:32:49.564
from our intent and purpose
to conduct world-class research

1:32:49.648 --> 1:32:50.983
on our discovery,

1:32:51.066 --> 1:32:54.528
which is a hallmark
of the University of Leicester.

1:32:56.363 --> 1:32:58.073
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:32:58.156 --> 1:33:01.660
it is the academic conclusion
of the University of Leicester

1:33:01.743 --> 1:33:04.079
that beyond reasonable doubt,

1:33:04.162 --> 1:33:06.623
the individual exhumed
at Greyfriars

1:33:06.707 --> 1:33:09.501
on the 5th of September 2012...

1:33:10.836 --> 1:33:14.923
is indeed King Richard III,
son of York,

1:33:15.007 --> 1:33:17.634
the last Plantagenet King
of England.

1:33:17.718 --> 1:33:19.720
(cheering)

1:33:35.652 --> 1:33:38.113
Well done. Well done.

1:33:38.196 --> 1:33:41.074
Philippa should have
been up on that podium with us.

1:33:41.158 --> 1:33:44.286
Don't go off-piste.
The world's press is here.

1:33:44.369 --> 1:33:47.456
It's about putting you and the
university front and centre.

1:33:47.539 --> 1:33:50.000
At least I've got the good grace
to feel guilty.

1:33:50.083 --> 1:33:51.084
(Taylor) Now, now.

1:33:53.295 --> 1:33:56.381
(sighs) Must dash.

1:34:03.513 --> 1:34:06.850
Philippa. How are you?
Sorry about the, er, seating.

1:34:06.933 --> 1:34:08.643
You haven't responded
to my emails.

1:34:08.727 --> 1:34:10.145
What's happening
with the burial?

1:34:10.228 --> 1:34:12.647
Oh, the tomb?
Have you seen the design?

1:34:12.731 --> 1:34:14.858
Very striking. I'll get them
to email it to you.

1:34:14.941 --> 1:34:17.402
It needs to have
a royal coat of arms on it.

1:34:17.486 --> 1:34:18.528
That's very important.

1:34:18.612 --> 1:34:20.655
It's a proper acknowledgement
of who he was.

1:34:20.739 --> 1:34:22.032
-A sign of respect.
-Yeah.

1:34:22.115 --> 1:34:24.493
I think this was discussed
by the burial committee,

1:34:24.576 --> 1:34:26.787
and they didn't think
that a coat of arms

1:34:26.870 --> 1:34:29.706
-is the correct protocol here.
-Sorry, why not?

1:34:29.790 --> 1:34:31.875
The committee felt that
the physical evidence

1:34:31.958 --> 1:34:33.960
gathered from the dig, the...

1:34:34.044 --> 1:34:36.213
hunch spine and so on,

1:34:36.296 --> 1:34:38.382
does tend to support
the historical view

1:34:38.465 --> 1:34:40.675
that Richard was a usurper.

1:34:40.759 --> 1:34:43.512
Richard. Benedict Cumberbatch
has agreed to do a reading

1:34:43.595 --> 1:34:46.014
-at the re-internment!
-Oh, that is...

1:34:46.098 --> 1:34:47.474
-That's a goal!
-(both laugh)

1:34:47.557 --> 1:34:49.226
Benedict Cumberbatch.

1:34:50.394 --> 1:34:52.104
Tell Tom I'll be there
in a minute.

1:34:52.187 --> 1:34:53.313
Yeah.

1:34:55.023 --> 1:34:56.441
I was tied up all yesterday

1:34:56.525 --> 1:34:58.193
on what to put
on the souvenir bars

1:34:58.276 --> 1:35:00.362
of the Richard III chocolate.

1:35:00.445 --> 1:35:03.782
Be shot glasses
and bookmarks tomorrow.

1:35:03.865 --> 1:35:07.744
Welcome to my world. OK.

1:35:14.251 --> 1:35:17.963
-He was not a usurper.
-(Taylor sighs)

1:35:18.046 --> 1:35:20.298
And the diagnosis
was scoliosis,

1:35:20.382 --> 1:35:23.093
curvature of the spine.
Not a hunchback.

1:35:23.176 --> 1:35:26.054
Well, the committee felt
that the condition,

1:35:26.138 --> 1:35:29.683
or whatever its precise label,
does suggest

1:35:29.766 --> 1:35:30.851
that there is more truth

1:35:30.934 --> 1:35:33.019
to Shakespeare's account
of Richard's life

1:35:33.103 --> 1:35:36.481
than perhaps you
and your supporters

1:35:36.565 --> 1:35:37.899
would like to admit to.

1:35:42.362 --> 1:35:46.658
So twisted spine equals
twisted personality, does it?

1:35:48.034 --> 1:35:50.287
No, no, no. (chuckles)

1:35:50.370 --> 1:35:52.664
That's not what the committee
is saying.

1:35:52.747 --> 1:35:55.834
It's... It's...
Let's just calm down.

1:35:55.917 --> 1:35:58.253
He was a legitimate king.

1:35:58.336 --> 1:36:02.007
And his right to a royal coat
of arms on his tomb

1:36:02.090 --> 1:36:03.884
is unarguable.

1:36:03.967 --> 1:36:06.928
I will fight you
all the way on this, Richard.

1:36:09.723 --> 1:36:11.224
Well, the decision of the burial

1:36:11.308 --> 1:36:14.060
rests with the holder
of the exhumation licence,

1:36:14.144 --> 1:36:18.023
which through Richard Buckley,
is the University of Leicester.

1:36:19.024 --> 1:36:20.484
I thought you fired him.

1:36:20.567 --> 1:36:22.819
We reinstated him.

1:36:22.903 --> 1:36:25.322
And we've awarded him
a doctorate.

1:36:25.405 --> 1:36:27.032
(Philippa)
When did that happen?

1:36:27.115 --> 1:36:28.867
Quite recently.

1:36:31.119 --> 1:36:34.247
I specified
a royal coat of arms

1:36:34.331 --> 1:36:37.125
as a condition of his reburial.

1:36:37.209 --> 1:36:39.127
But Richard Buckley
didn't include it

1:36:39.211 --> 1:36:40.670
on the exhumation licence.

1:36:40.754 --> 1:36:43.215
Well, that is unfortunate...

1:36:44.341 --> 1:36:45.926
for you.

1:36:50.972 --> 1:36:52.307
Sorry.

1:37:00.190 --> 1:37:01.942
(girl) Excuse me.

1:37:03.026 --> 1:37:04.486
Are you Philippa?

1:37:05.820 --> 1:37:06.905
Yes.

1:37:06.988 --> 1:37:08.823
Would you come and give a talk
to our school

1:37:08.907 --> 1:37:10.700
about finding Richard III,
please?

1:37:11.618 --> 1:37:13.787
Oh, that's very flattering.

1:37:13.870 --> 1:37:15.455
What made you come and ask me?

1:37:15.539 --> 1:37:17.207
That man over there.

1:37:17.290 --> 1:37:19.960
He told us that you
were the one to talk to.

1:37:21.336 --> 1:37:22.712
Did he?

1:37:27.133 --> 1:37:29.553
Well, I'm sure
we can arrange something.

1:37:55.912 --> 1:37:58.164
(horse neighs)

1:38:16.891 --> 1:38:19.436
All I ever wanted
was to find you...

1:38:20.895 --> 1:38:23.815
and show everyone you
were always the rightful king.

1:38:27.986 --> 1:38:30.196
But they're taking you
away from me again.

1:38:30.280 --> 1:38:32.991
Why don't you say
what you came here to say?

1:38:36.953 --> 1:38:39.122
I don't want to let you go.

1:38:39.205 --> 1:38:40.832
You know the truth.

1:38:42.250 --> 1:38:43.835
Nothing else matters.

1:38:47.172 --> 1:38:48.590
Goodbye.

1:38:53.386 --> 1:38:54.804
Thank you, Philippa.

1:38:55.930 --> 1:38:57.390
You're welcome.

1:39:56.491 --> 1:39:59.285
(choir sings)

1:40:41.035 --> 1:40:43.747
Hmm. I'm surprised
to see him here.

1:40:44.539 --> 1:40:46.583
He must've joined the fan club.

1:40:46.666 --> 1:40:48.209
(chuckles)

1:40:56.843 --> 1:40:58.762
-Philippa.
-Oh, hi.

1:40:59.929 --> 1:41:01.431
It's Dr Buckley now, is it?

1:41:01.514 --> 1:41:03.016
Oh, no, that's just for,
you know,

1:41:03.099 --> 1:41:05.393
business cards and stuff.
Silly.

1:41:05.477 --> 1:41:07.228
Are you going to
the big banquet later?

1:41:07.312 --> 1:41:10.857
I made sure you got an invite.
I've gotta go and change.

1:41:10.940 --> 1:41:13.735
I'll save you a place at the
top table. I'll see you later.

1:41:19.491 --> 1:41:20.617
(girl) Where's Mummy?

1:41:20.700 --> 1:41:22.952
-(man) I don't know, bubba.
-Richard?

1:41:24.496 --> 1:41:28.416
Erm... No, I'm... I'm Pete.
Have we met?

1:41:30.585 --> 1:41:32.086
I'm so sorry, it's my mistake.

1:41:32.170 --> 1:41:34.005
-You're an actor, aren't you?
-Yes.

1:41:34.088 --> 1:41:36.090
I saw you play Richard
in Edinburgh.

1:41:36.174 --> 1:41:38.510
Oh, right. Yeah, well,
we thought we'd come down

1:41:38.593 --> 1:41:40.386
-and see him off.
-Right.

1:41:40.470 --> 1:41:43.139
I have to say,
you played him beautifully.

1:41:43.223 --> 1:41:44.307
(Pete) Oh.

1:41:44.390 --> 1:41:46.226
Your performance,
it really, erm...

1:41:48.520 --> 1:41:50.104
stayed with me.

1:41:50.772 --> 1:41:53.024
Thank you very much.
That's... Thanks.

1:41:53.107 --> 1:41:54.317
(girl) Where's Mummy gone?

1:41:54.400 --> 1:41:57.320
Erm, I think we better go
and find Mummy.

1:41:57.403 --> 1:41:58.947
Er, very nice to meet you.

1:41:59.030 --> 1:42:00.824
-Philippa.
-Philippa.

1:42:00.907 --> 1:42:02.158
-Say bye.
-Bye!

1:42:02.242 --> 1:42:03.535
-Bye, love!
-Have a nice day!

1:42:03.618 --> 1:42:04.953
You too.

1:42:29.185 --> 1:42:30.353
(both chuckle)

1:42:49.289 --> 1:42:51.499
(applause)

1:43:08.766 --> 1:43:12.520
Hello.
My name is Philippa Langley.

1:43:12.604 --> 1:43:14.397
And I'm here today
to tell you a story

1:43:14.480 --> 1:43:18.943
about a person
who was judged unfairly in life

1:43:19.027 --> 1:43:23.364
and never given the opportunity
to show their true potential.

1:44:04.405 --> 1:44:05.907
Thank you.
