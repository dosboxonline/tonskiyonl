WEBVTT

01:17.000 --> 01:18.000
Before you say anything,
I'm not your brother.

01:18.000 --> 01:19.000
I'm your half-brother.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.000
What was that?

01:21.000 --> 01:22.000
Why would you begin
a conversation like that?

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
Because you are about
to ask me for money,

01:25.000 --> 01:26.000
and when I always say,
"Why should I

01:26.000 --> 01:29.000
you always say,
"Because I am your brother,"

01:29.000 --> 01:31.000
and I never point out
you are my half-brother.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.000
I never say it. But things
happening around here lately--

01:33.000 --> 01:36.000
Hi, Paxton. How are
your erratic head movements?

01:36.000 --> 01:37.000
I ask
because I read an article.

01:37.000 --> 01:40.000
Yeah, they're under control.

01:40.000 --> 01:44.000
How's the, uh,
cement art work?

01:44.000 --> 01:47.000
She just sold a piece
for $50,000.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.000
A frozen waterfall.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
It felt appropriate
for the times.

01:50.000 --> 01:52.000
How is it appropriate
for the times?

01:52.000 --> 01:53.000
You know what?
It doesn't matter.

01:53.000 --> 01:56.000
I was actually calling
to see how you were.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
'Cause I heard
it's bad in New York.

01:58.000 --> 02:01.000
It is bad.
They canceled the NBA.

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
We heard London's
under total lockdown.

02:04.000 --> 02:07.000
I've been furloughed
by the way.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.000
That's great!
-Yeah.

02:08.000 --> 02:11.000
Now there is literally zero
purpose to my life.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.000
How is Linda?

02:13.000 --> 02:17.000
Yeah, she's somewhere
in the house.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.000
Is there
some type of issue?

02:19.000 --> 02:22.000
Is there an issue?
Let me see.

02:22.000 --> 02:25.000
Convenient lie to avoid
forensic examination

02:25.000 --> 02:27.000
of our domestic circumstances
or tell the truth?

02:27.000 --> 02:28.000
Okay, convenient lie.

02:28.000 --> 02:31.000
No. There is no issue.
We are fine.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.000
Can you tell her
I'm gonna Skype her?

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Also, David,
I've sold my motorbike.

02:34.000 --> 02:36.000
You've what?

02:36.000 --> 02:37.000
Yeah, I have a buyer.
He'll pay me

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
when we are all unlocked

02:38.000 --> 02:42.000
from this fucking prison
of psychological hell-chains.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Fucking flames
of burning aloneness.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
The screw of isolation
until you can't tell

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
what is your body
and what is furniture.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.000
No possibility
of revving the engine

02:50.000 --> 02:53.000
and riding away. Am I conveying
anything of my mood to you?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
Why have you sold your bike?

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
You are your bike.
Your bike is you.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.000
Yeah, I have sold myself.

03:00.000 --> 03:03.000
I have sold my former self.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
I felt sorry for the bike.

03:04.000 --> 03:07.000
It deserved someone who can do
justice to its spirit.

03:07.000 --> 03:11.000
Someone who still
breaks the fucking rules.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
So, you and Linda, what,
you had a fight?

03:13.000 --> 03:17.000
Linda said she was planning
to end our thing,

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
our relationship,
our whatever this ever was,

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
because we'd grown apart,

03:24.000 --> 03:26.000
meaning that she had gone up
and I have gone down.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
She was planning to end it
before lockdown was announced.

03:30.000 --> 03:34.000
...droplets and moisture
because we were shouting.

03:34.000 --> 03:37.000
I said some things
and she said some things

03:37.000 --> 03:39.000
and now
we are stuck here together

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
with the things we said

03:40.000 --> 03:44.000
echoing around the house
like fucking bells ringing.

03:46.000 --> 03:49.000
For two weeks
we are locked together here.

03:51.000 --> 03:56.000
Anyway. Truth be told,
I just wanted

03:56.000 --> 03:59.000
-And you chose us?
-Yeah, why not?

03:59.000 --> 04:00.000
What happened to Mike?
Your friend Mike.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Oh, no, no. Mike and I
are no longer speaking.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
He crossed...
My delivery!

04:05.000 --> 04:09.000
Crossed an important threshold
when, uh, when he said that

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
the COVID virus
was the consequence

04:11.000 --> 04:15.000
of the secret release by Jews
of alien DNA

04:15.000 --> 04:17.000
into the
water sprinkling system

04:17.000 --> 04:20.000
of a Chinese golf resort.

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
It looks like
your food has arrived,

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
-so we'll let you go.
-It's not food,

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Yeah, hang in, brother.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.000
-Half-brother.
-  Tell Linda

04:28.000 --> 04:31.000
Yeah, I'll leave her a note.
Just to compound the oddness.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
The stark reality
of fighting Coronavirus...

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
...Trafalgar Square in London
usually crowded.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
Evidence of social distancing
in action.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
In this critically
important time,

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
the Prime Minister
Boris Johnson himself infected,

04:52.000 --> 04:53.000
but been sharing...

05:14.000 --> 05:17.000
Maria, hey!
Is everything okay?

05:17.000 --> 05:19.000
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Everything's great.

05:19.000 --> 05:21.000
You know, we're staying strong.
Yeah, we just talked to Paxton.

05:21.000 --> 05:25.000
Hmm. Yes, I head. Some of it.
I put a pillow over my head.

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
He said you had symptoms.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.000
It passed I think. I hope.
I don't know.

05:31.000 --> 05:34.000
Oh, green smoothie.
You must send me that recipe.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.000
It's not a recipe,
it's an action.

05:36.000 --> 05:39.000
You just put the green stuff in
and press the on button.

05:39.000 --> 05:41.000
How are things
with you and Paxton?

05:41.000 --> 05:42.000
Is everything okay?

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
You know
everything is not okay.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
Not only
is everything not okay,

05:48.000 --> 05:49.000
nothing is okay.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
Everything is never okay.
Even his name is not okay.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
This is him speaking.
He says even his name

05:55.000 --> 05:56.000
That's how he is lately.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
He's changed so much.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.000
Oh, we all change.

06:01.000 --> 06:03.000
I mean, Linda, you've evolved,
he's mutated.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
He needs some help.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
-I read an article--
-Do you know he said

06:07.000 --> 06:10.000
that any man over 35
who rides a bus is a failure?

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
-He rides the bus every day.
Or he used to.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
-He does it to torture himself.
-No man is ever really

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
So, I heard
he's selling his motorbike.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
That's a big step.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
Yeah, we both agreed
that he needed some time,

06:21.000 --> 06:23.000
so he's planning on using
the money from selling the bike

06:23.000 --> 06:25.000
to go to Kazakhstan
to think about his life.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Why Kazakhstan?

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
We went on a road trip there
ten years ago.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.000
Ten years ago?
A million years ago.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.000
Anyway, now he is stuck here,
and I am stuck here.

06:37.000 --> 06:41.000
-Linda, is there someone else?
-Nope, just me and him.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
No, I mean, like,
another man.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.000
-No.
-A woman?

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
What?

06:47.000 --> 06:50.000
I was just speculating.

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
Thinking about that night
we came to London

06:53.000 --> 06:57.000
Oh, that was just weed
and curiosity.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.000
We both had orgasms, Linda.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.000
You know they say these calls
aren't really the most secure.

07:01.000 --> 07:04.000
I think
about that night sometimes.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.000
-You do?
-Yeah, don't you?

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
Mmm... Listen, Maria,
I've been on Skype

07:09.000 --> 07:11.000
The office is locked down.
I really gotta

07:11.000 --> 07:13.000
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.000
-I love you.
-What?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.000
-God.
-

07:38.000 --> 07:40.000
Paxton, are you
going somewhere?

07:41.000 --> 07:42.000
Where would I be going?

07:42.000 --> 07:45.000
Why is the hose
in your exhaust?

07:47.000 --> 07:48.000
I was just gonna
take a selfie.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.000
Someone at work texted me
and asked how I was

07:50.000 --> 07:52.000
coping with lockdown.

07:52.000 --> 07:53.000
So I was gonna send
a photo of myself

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
with the hose shoved
up my helmet by way of reply.

07:56.000 --> 07:58.000
I thought it'd be funny.

07:58.000 --> 08:00.000
An amusing expression
of despair.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.000
You were really
just gonna take a selfie?

08:03.000 --> 08:05.000
Yeah, I had the phone
in my hand.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.000
You weren't gonna
start the engine?

08:06.000 --> 08:08.000
And go where?
You can't go anywhere.

08:11.000 --> 08:15.000
I came in here
and I could smell

08:15.000 --> 08:20.000
And the smell...
it made me very sad

08:20.000 --> 08:24.000
That shelf's covered in oil,
you're gonna get your ass

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
-Jesus, what a day!
-Bad?

08:28.000 --> 08:30.000
No, just work.
I had some bad news.

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
Nothing compared
to... everything.

08:33.000 --> 08:35.000
I really was just gonna
take a selfie, by the way.

08:35.000 --> 08:37.000
"By the way,"
"just so you know,"

08:37.000 --> 08:40.000
Just... just a little game.

08:41.000 --> 08:43.000
Or a rehearsal.

08:44.000 --> 08:47.000
I'm not-- Please don't think
I'm looking for anything.

08:48.000 --> 08:50.000
You know Maria just called me
and said that she loves me?

08:50.000 --> 08:51.000
-What?
-I know.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.000
Secrets coming out
all over the place.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.000
You got the key
to get back in?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
-No.
-I'll leave the door

09:19.000 --> 09:20.000
What's wrong?

09:24.000 --> 09:27.000
You playing
with the hoses and exhausts

09:27.000 --> 09:30.000
and we carry on
as if everything was normal.

09:32.000 --> 09:35.000
I'm not normal lately,
I know that.

09:36.000 --> 09:39.000
I haven't been
sleeping at all.

09:41.000 --> 09:43.000
I've never been normal, but...

09:43.000 --> 09:45.000
I used to be
quite proud of it.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.000
-Just what?
-I don't know.

09:48.000 --> 09:52.000
I'm just acutely aware
of the inconvenience it causes.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.000
My super analysis
of every grain of sand.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.000
Every word.

09:59.000 --> 10:02.000
Being locked up
is making it worse.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.000
We have to find
some way of getting

10:04.000 --> 10:06.000
We're only together because
we're in the same house.

10:06.000 --> 10:10.000
We can sort of move around
each other until we're free...

10:11.000 --> 10:13.000
-What? What is it?
-Oh, nothing.

10:14.000 --> 10:15.000
Good night.

10:15.000 --> 10:17.000
It's a bit of
Christmas decoration.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.000
It's been there
since Christmas.

10:19.000 --> 10:21.000
My therapist says
I should try to tolerate it.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.000
To use it as a test.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.000
Up until now, I've been able
to live with it,

10:25.000 --> 10:26.000
as a test
to prove my progress.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.000
Well, fuck progress.

10:28.000 --> 10:31.000
-Why don't you take it down?
-No, my therapist says--

10:31.000 --> 10:34.000
-Fuck the therapist. Paxton--
-You almost did.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
Grow up. Take it down.

10:35.000 --> 10:37.000
If it bothers you,
take it down, okay?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.000
Christmas is not exactly
a great memory anyway, is it?

10:39.000 --> 10:42.000
Christmas is not
a great memory.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.000
Beginning of the end for us,
don't you think?

10:45.000 --> 10:47.000
That was way before Christmas
for me.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.000
Sorry.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.000
Why do people think
honesty is good?

10:58.000 --> 11:00.000
What are you doing
about therapy anyway?

11:00.000 --> 11:02.000
I'm doing it on Zoom.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.000
-My therapist has antlers
on his wall.

11:04.000 --> 11:07.000
These are extraordinary
circumstances, Paxton.

11:07.000 --> 11:08.000
You can't live with a woman
who has dumped you

11:08.000 --> 11:10.000
and a piece of tinsel
on the ceiling.

11:10.000 --> 11:13.000
-Have we decided
to laugh about all this?

11:13.000 --> 11:14.000
Nothing else
we can do there,

11:15.000 --> 11:16.000
Do you want a chair?

11:17.000 --> 11:18.000
Sure.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
-

11:26.000 --> 11:28.000
Bravo.

11:28.000 --> 11:30.000
-Fuck! That's better.
-Hang on.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.000
You know, when I saw you
in the garage I thought...

11:41.000 --> 11:44.000
"Was it really me
on the back of your bike

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Yeah, it was you.

11:49.000 --> 11:51.000
Hanging on and screaming.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.000
Well, that's what
I'm doing now.

11:55.000 --> 11:56.000
Hanging on and screaming,
but you can't hear me.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.000
Nobody can.
Anyway, good night.

12:00.000 --> 12:02.000
Screaming about what?

12:02.000 --> 12:06.000
What are you screaming about?
I'm the one that's screaming!

12:24.000 --> 12:25.000
Hello, stranger!

12:28.000 --> 12:30.000
Hi.
-How are you?

12:31.000 --> 12:33.000
Terrible. You?

12:34.000 --> 12:35.000
Awful.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.000
Hello!

12:43.000 --> 12:47.000
Does anyone here in our lovely
Portland Street prison

12:48.000 --> 12:50.000
I read a lot of poetry

12:50.000 --> 12:53.000
and I've read even more lately
'cause I can't sleep.

12:53.000 --> 12:55.000
It's actually quite a nice way
to discover

12:55.000 --> 12:58.000
that you're not
the only human being on earth

12:58.000 --> 12:59.000
Paxton!

13:00.000 --> 13:02.000
What the fuck
are you doing?

13:02.000 --> 13:04.000
I'm entertaining
our fellow inmates.

13:04.000 --> 13:08.000
This poem
is called  Stand Up!

13:08.000 --> 13:10.000
It's by D.H. Lawrence,
by the way.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.000
"By the way,"
"just so you know,"

13:15.000 --> 13:16.000
All right, here goes.

13:17.000 --> 13:20.000
"Stand up,
but not for Jesus!

13:21.000 --> 13:23.000
It's a little late for that.

13:23.000 --> 13:25.000
Stand up for justice
and a jolly life.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
I'll hold your hat.

13:27.000 --> 13:32.000
Stand up, stand up for justice,
ye swindled little blokes!

13:32.000 --> 13:36.000
Stand up and do some punching,
give 'em a few hard pokes.

13:36.000 --> 13:42.000
Stand up for a new arrangement
for a chance of life all round,

13:43.000 --> 13:46.000
for freedom
and the fun of living,

13:46.000 --> 13:49.000
break in,
and hold the ground!"

13:50.000 --> 13:53.000
-

13:53.000 --> 13:55.000
Thank you.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.000
Sorry if I woke you.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.000
But I am going
slightly mad lately.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.000
My advice to everyone

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
is to use
these strange times

14:07.000 --> 14:10.000
to steal all the things
that you think life owes you.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.000
Go to sleep,
you bloody tosser!

14:11.000 --> 14:13.000
Yeah, well, if I could
I would.

14:13.000 --> 14:15.000
Hey, leave him be, mate!

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
And if I come across any other
good poems, I'll share it.

14:17.000 --> 14:19.000
We love it!

14:19.000 --> 14:20.000
Good night, Portland Street.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.000
Night, night!

14:22.000 --> 14:23.000
Thank you!

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
God, please let me sleep.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.000
I swear to God!

15:01.000 --> 15:03.000
What the fuck are you doing
in my garden?

15:05.000 --> 15:06.000
You all right?

15:06.000 --> 15:09.000
-We're just gathering these.
-They're just poppies.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.000
They're bulbs of poppies.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.000
All the dealers in our estate
have been arrested,

15:12.000 --> 15:16.000
because they're the only people
out on the streets, innit?

15:16.000 --> 15:19.000
With these poppy bulbs,
you can make a sort of opium.

15:19.000 --> 15:21.000
You just slit the skins
and juice comes out.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.000
How did you know
they were here?

15:23.000 --> 15:26.000
We live in that tower block
up there, bro.

15:26.000 --> 15:29.000
Friend of ours has a telescope.
He's into stars and shit.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.000
We've been looking down
on houses for a laugh.

15:31.000 --> 15:35.000
Looking through windows
and then we saw all these

15:35.000 --> 15:38.000
What the fuck are they all
doing growing in my garden?

15:38.000 --> 15:41.000
I think hippies
used to squat in these houses

15:41.000 --> 15:43.000
I think they grew them
and they just went wild.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.000
How do you refine
the juice?

15:45.000 --> 15:48.000
You don't. You just drip it
onto tobacco

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
Or you can mix it
with Coca-Cola if you want

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
Yeah, well,
I don't smoke anymore

15:55.000 --> 15:57.000
or do drugs of any kind,

15:57.000 --> 16:02.000
but back in the bad old days
I did smoke quite a lot

16:02.000 --> 16:04.000
This is not
as strong as heroin.

16:04.000 --> 16:06.000
It's quite a gentle hit.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.000
-It's organic, bro.
-Organic?

16:08.000 --> 16:09.000
Yeah.

16:09.000 --> 16:12.000
That would explain
the hedgehog.

16:12.000 --> 16:17.000
There's a hedgehog
in this garden who is

16:22.000 --> 16:27.000
Would a very small amount
help you sleep, do you think?

16:27.000 --> 16:30.000
You sleep like a baby.
Smooths everything out.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.000
-No mean voices in the night.
-No mean voices in the night.

16:33.000 --> 16:37.000
That would be nice.
Well, well, well.

17:18.000 --> 17:19.000
Paxton!

17:38.000 --> 17:41.000
Paxton, for fuck's sake!

18:04.000 --> 18:06.000
Hey, Toby!

18:07.000 --> 18:08.000
-Hi.
-Hey, how's the cough?

18:08.000 --> 18:11.000
A bit better I think.
How are you?

18:11.000 --> 18:13.000
I had it I think,
but it's passed.

18:13.000 --> 18:16.000
It's like a Valkyrie.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
What?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.000
It's a Viking spirit who,
before battles, decides

18:20.000 --> 18:22.000
who will live
and who will die.

18:22.000 --> 18:27.000
Valkyries, uh,
make their choices

18:27.000 --> 18:30.000
No morality,
no good or bad.

18:30.000 --> 18:33.000
It's just so unfair
how some people

18:33.000 --> 18:36.000
Toby, you're back.
How are you?

18:36.000 --> 18:38.000
Gangster. Thank you.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.000
-Hello!
-Donald!

18:41.000 --> 18:43.000
You got a tie on.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.000
One of my father's old ones.

18:45.000 --> 18:48.000
I've become nostalgic
for old-fashioned formality.

18:48.000 --> 18:52.000
On these Zoom things,
I always imagine every man

18:52.000 --> 18:53.000
-Ooh!
-

18:54.000 --> 18:55.000
Donald, is that
your house?

18:55.000 --> 18:59.000
Uh, no. I'm at my mother's.
Anthony threw me out.

19:01.000 --> 19:06.000
Oh! That's not allowed,
is it?

19:06.000 --> 19:09.000
We had an awful night,
and everything came out.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.000
We found out we, uh,
hate each other. So...

19:13.000 --> 19:15.000
Hi!

19:15.000 --> 19:19.000
Uh, Melissa.
Hey, how is Italy?

19:19.000 --> 19:21.000
No, I'm in Sweden.

19:22.000 --> 19:24.000
-What?
-Look.

19:25.000 --> 19:27.000
You can go to bars here.

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
Hmm. Is anybody
obeying the rules?

19:43.000 --> 19:47.000
After ten years sober,
that was fucking smart.

19:51.000 --> 19:53.000
Wait, who are we waiting for?

19:53.000 --> 19:56.000
-Timothy, I think.
-Oh, is Timothy okay?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.000
Why wouldn't he be?

19:58.000 --> 20:00.000
Well, he's got
an underlying

20:00.000 --> 20:02.000
-Do you know which one?
-No.

20:02.000 --> 20:04.000
He just seemed
like a sort of person

20:04.000 --> 20:06.000
who would have
an underlying health condition.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.000
Shall we just start
without Timothy?

20:08.000 --> 20:12.000
By the way,
I am also wearing shoes.

20:12.000 --> 20:14.000
- Seriously,

20:14.000 --> 20:17.000
I have something to say.
Something important.

20:17.000 --> 20:19.000
-

20:19.000 --> 20:23.000
Oh, um, hang on.
Oh, it's a message

20:26.000 --> 20:29.000
-God!
-Has he got it?

20:29.000 --> 20:31.000
"Dear, Linda.
As of 9:00 a.m. this morning,

20:31.000 --> 20:33.000
I am resigning my position
at Miracore Media

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
with immediate effect.
I have had time alone

20:35.000 --> 20:37.000
and I've realized
that what this company does

20:37.000 --> 20:39.000
is just self-indulgent
media bullshit,

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
supporting corrosive
international capitalism

20:42.000 --> 20:44.000
We should be using
our creativity

20:44.000 --> 20:48.000
not sell handbags
to the wives

20:48.000 --> 20:50.000
Yours in isolation. Timothy."

20:50.000 --> 20:56.000
Just been watching
David Attenborough

20:56.000 --> 20:57.000
Did he snap?

20:57.000 --> 20:59.000
Okay, so there's no need
to wait for Timothy.

20:59.000 --> 21:01.000
Let's get this done.

21:01.000 --> 21:03.000
Sounds awfully grave, Linda.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.000
Daddy, Daddy.
-Shh. Daddy's on a call.

21:10.000 --> 21:13.000
Yesterday, I had
a very long Zoom call

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
All continents
were represented.

21:16.000 --> 21:18.000
And it seems
that all over the world

21:18.000 --> 21:21.000
the company is facing
the same issues

21:21.000 --> 21:25.000
As CEO of Miracore UK,
it is my...

21:26.000 --> 21:29.000
unfortunate duty
to let you know

21:29.000 --> 21:33.000
that there will be
some furloughing of employees

21:34.000 --> 21:36.000
And also a number
of compulsory redundancies

21:36.000 --> 21:39.000
effective from today.

21:39.000 --> 21:46.000
I assume the Inuit system
of leaving the old

21:46.000 --> 21:49.000
Donald, please don't jump
to conclusions.

21:49.000 --> 21:51.000
Linda, what do you mean?

21:51.000 --> 21:54.000
Uh, in normal times,
I would've gathered

21:54.000 --> 21:56.000
Everyone?

22:00.000 --> 22:02.000
Everyone on this Zoom call
is on this call

22:02.000 --> 22:05.000
because all of your positions
have been deemed

22:05.000 --> 22:09.000
and as of today your contracts
of employment with Miracore

22:12.000 --> 22:13.000
Okay.

22:13.000 --> 22:15.000
I'm glad I'm home.

22:15.000 --> 22:17.000
I'm going to feed
the fucking chickens.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
This is really bad, Linda.
How do you sleep?

22:23.000 --> 22:24.000
Hello!

22:25.000 --> 22:27.000
Hello.

22:27.000 --> 22:30.000
Look at my dinosaur.

22:34.000 --> 22:36.000
Daddy...

22:37.000 --> 22:39.000
Malcolm, I thought
being furloughed

22:39.000 --> 22:40.000
meant that the government
pays your wages,

22:41.000 --> 22:42.000
but you don't do any work.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.000
Yeah, it does,
it does, it does.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
But COVID
makes everything different.

22:45.000 --> 22:47.000
So sad. So sad.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.000
All of this is impacting
on everyone

22:51.000 --> 22:53.000
Yeah, but I'm not in
your pastoral care, right?

22:53.000 --> 22:54.000
I work for you.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.000
And all I wanna know is,

22:56.000 --> 22:59.000
if I am furloughed,
why are you asking me

22:59.000 --> 23:00.000
It's illegal, isn't it?

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
I'm a Christian man.

23:01.000 --> 23:03.000
We all know that you are
a Christian man.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.000
You say it like I ram it
down your throats.

23:05.000 --> 23:07.000
I do not ram it down
your fucking throat.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.000
Malcolm, just tell me,
what is it that you want me

23:10.000 --> 23:11.000
We have a situation, Paxton.

23:11.000 --> 23:13.000
Yeah, I'm leaving this call
unless you tell me.

23:13.000 --> 23:15.000
I sat through your prayer.

23:15.000 --> 23:16.000
I begin every FaceTime
with a prayer.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.000
My choice. Right?
I'm the boss.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.000
Yeah, you are the boss.
So what do you want me

23:22.000 --> 23:25.000
Due to lockdown, all the major
department stores

23:25.000 --> 23:28.000
B2B Pro Freight Services
are among several

23:28.000 --> 23:33.000
which have been asked to
transport valuable retail items

23:33.000 --> 23:37.000
to secure storage facilities
in shitholes like Dagenham.

23:37.000 --> 23:40.000
The fabric, Paxton,
of our society is torn,

23:40.000 --> 23:45.000
Fears of rioting and looting.
Pestilence. Apocalyptic words.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.000
I'm giving you ten seconds
to tell me what it is

23:48.000 --> 23:50.000
-Ten, nine, eight...
-Because of this crisis,

23:51.000 --> 23:53.000
-Drivers like you.
-...seven, six, five...

23:53.000 --> 23:55.000
Department stores
only allow their goods to be

23:55.000 --> 23:58.000
-who do not
have criminal records.

23:59.000 --> 24:01.000
I repeat.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.000
B2B Pro Freight Services
have urgent need for drivers

24:04.000 --> 24:08.000
registered to us who do not
have criminal records.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
So why are you
talking to me?

24:11.000 --> 24:13.000
I have contracts
to carry valuables

24:13.000 --> 24:17.000
across London, and they
all want everything out

24:17.000 --> 24:19.000
And I only have
two fucking drivers.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.000
So what's your solution?

24:21.000 --> 24:25.000
Deception. Forgiveness.
Redemption. Bunce.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.000
What the fuck is bunce?

24:26.000 --> 24:28.000
Old East End word
for cash, Paxton,

24:28.000 --> 24:30.000
in return
for grand deception.

24:30.000 --> 24:33.000
Facilitated by my forgiveness
and your redemption.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.000
All right, get there.
Get there, Malcolm.

24:34.000 --> 24:37.000
I've printed off an ID
with a security level A2.

24:37.000 --> 24:39.000
Clean. With your photo on it
and a name.

24:39.000 --> 24:41.000
It is not your name.

24:41.000 --> 24:42.000
I can't officially take you
off furlough and give you

24:43.000 --> 24:45.000
because you used to be
a bike slag,

24:45.000 --> 24:47.000
so I will have to pretend
you are someone else

24:47.000 --> 24:49.000
You've worked for this company
as a driver for seven years.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.000
And I have never had
a single complaint.

24:51.000 --> 24:53.000
You've only ever driven
low value packages,

24:53.000 --> 24:56.000
but I believe you are a man
who can be trusted.

24:58.000 --> 25:00.000
That I am.

25:01.000 --> 25:03.000
Yeah, I can be trusted.

25:03.000 --> 25:05.000
I mean, what happened
was a long time ago.

25:05.000 --> 25:06.000
Yeah, I don't wanna to know.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.000
No, it was biker versus biker.

25:08.000 --> 25:11.000
The Lord forgives.
B2B Pro Freight Services

25:11.000 --> 25:13.000
If it wasn't for the fucking
convictions from that night,

25:13.000 --> 25:15.000
my whole life would've been
radically different.

25:15.000 --> 25:17.000
Two hundred a day in cash.

25:17.000 --> 25:20.000
I don't care about the cash.
I wanna make a deal

25:20.000 --> 25:22.000
Look, I will do this
on the condition

25:22.000 --> 25:25.000
that when this is all over,
you will consider me

25:25.000 --> 25:27.000
My entire life
has been fucked up

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
because of things I did
on one night.

25:28.000 --> 25:30.000
My wife...

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
-My wife has grown out of me,

25:32.000 --> 25:34.000
because I am still Mr. Fuck-All
behind the wheel of a van.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.000
I am not stupid.

25:36.000 --> 25:37.000
I read poetry.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.000
I could be someone.

25:38.000 --> 25:40.000
I've got another call,
Paxton.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.000
It is a very busy time,
the West End is going mad.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.000
Will you do it?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.000
All right, if I do this
for you, Malcolm,

25:44.000 --> 25:47.000
I want you to practice
what you preach.

25:47.000 --> 25:50.000
About forgiveness,
and lost sheep and redemption,

25:50.000 --> 25:52.000
all of it, and give me
a chance to come off the road.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.000
Everything
is possible, Paxton.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.000
God bless you.

25:56.000 --> 25:58.000
Selfridges, Thursday.
Harvey Nichols, Friday.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.000
-Right, yeah.
-I will e-mail

26:00.000 --> 26:01.000
and your new identity.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.000
Okay, okay. And after...
After Harrods on Saturday--

26:04.000 --> 26:06.000
God bless you, Paxton.

26:06.000 --> 26:08.000
-

26:14.000 --> 26:15.000
Shit.

26:48.000 --> 26:51.000
Hey, Linda,
how's lockdown?

26:51.000 --> 26:54.000
It's pretty bad.

26:54.000 --> 26:55.000
How's Chicago?

26:56.000 --> 26:57.000
I'm in Vermont.

26:57.000 --> 26:59.000
Yeah, moved the family
out to Vermont.

26:59.000 --> 27:03.000
We're all here crazy happy.

27:03.000 --> 27:07.000
Kids make a lot of noise,
so I got these

27:07.000 --> 27:10.000
Noise canceling. They work,
like, you literally

27:10.000 --> 27:12.000
No, I don't have those.

27:13.000 --> 27:15.000
I can see in your face

27:15.000 --> 27:18.000
that you, uh, spoke
to the guys at Events

27:18.000 --> 27:21.000
Update. Yeah.
Yeah, I updated them.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.000
-Did you read them

27:25.000 --> 27:27.000
The stuff
about the Miracore family?

27:27.000 --> 27:31.000
No, no, no, I didn't think
that would translate. Um--

27:31.000 --> 27:36.000
Linda, I wrote that message
from the heart. I really meant

27:36.000 --> 27:38.000
I can't believe you didn't
read it out to them.

27:38.000 --> 27:41.000
I didn't think it was
appropriate to say

27:41.000 --> 27:43.000
and there comes a time
in every family's life

27:43.000 --> 27:46.000
when it's best if some family
members fly the nest."

27:47.000 --> 27:48.000
Why is that not appropriate?

27:49.000 --> 27:50.000
Because they're not
flying the nest, are they?

27:50.000 --> 27:53.000
They're being
thrown out of the nest

27:53.000 --> 27:54.000
into the long grass
under the tree.

27:54.000 --> 27:56.000
There's no tree.
What tree?

27:56.000 --> 27:59.000
It's your nest, Guy.
You came up with the analogy

27:59.000 --> 28:00.000
So there has to be a tree.

28:01.000 --> 28:02.000
Do you have
a temperature, Linda?

28:04.000 --> 28:07.000
Um, there are two big events
which were already set up

28:07.000 --> 28:09.000
One was at Westfield,

28:09.000 --> 28:11.000
the other one was
the Eve Schwarz store takeover

28:11.000 --> 28:13.000
But both Westfield and Harrods
have closed their door.

28:13.000 --> 28:14.000
I love Harrods.

28:14.000 --> 28:16.000
Yeah, I love Harrods, too.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.000
I worked there for five years,
they were the happiest

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Anyway, the launch
of Eve Schwarz collection

28:20.000 --> 28:23.000
so I chose Harrods
because of its size

28:23.000 --> 28:26.000
You chose?
I thought Melissa was

28:26.000 --> 28:30.000
Yeah. Sometimes I questioned
her-- It doesn't matter.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
You've been carrying that
department a long time.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.000
Yeah, well, they were family,
weren't they?

28:36.000 --> 28:38.000
And that's what
you do with family.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.000
You carry them until
you get a direction

28:40.000 --> 28:41.000
and then
you dutifully drop them.

28:42.000 --> 28:44.000
Anyway, at Harrods,
we have five million dollars

28:44.000 --> 28:46.000
clothing and accessories
already installed

28:46.000 --> 28:49.000
and store takeover
under Miracore liability.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.000
And that includes
the Harris Diamond

28:50.000 --> 28:52.000
which was to be
the centerpiece of the show.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.000
The Harris Diamond is under
our insurance liability?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.000
It's, um...

28:57.000 --> 29:01.000
It's safe in the Harrods'
secure vault, but, yes.

29:04.000 --> 29:07.000
I suggested to the people
at Eve Schwarz

29:07.000 --> 29:10.000
that we put everything into
Harrods' secure storage

29:10.000 --> 29:11.000
until this, um...

29:12.000 --> 29:14.000
Uh, until this situation
is ended.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.000
But we have a problem
with insurance. You see...

29:19.000 --> 29:21.000
Uh...

29:21.000 --> 29:23.000
So, Eve Schwarz's
insurance policy

29:23.000 --> 29:25.000
means that
they are not allowed

29:25.000 --> 29:27.000
except under their own
corporate supervision.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.000
So the merchandise

29:29.000 --> 29:31.000
will have to be
taken out of the store

29:32.000 --> 29:34.000
Anyway, the stores
are allocating for collection.

29:35.000 --> 29:38.000
We have Westfield on Friday,
Harrods on Saturday.

29:38.000 --> 29:40.000
And then we discuss
your role and your salary.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.000
-There'll be a lot

29:44.000 --> 29:49.000
-Things are changing.
-That's excellent news.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.000
Say hello to London.

29:52.000 --> 29:54.000
-Enjoy Vermont.
-  You bet.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.000
What? Oh, fuck! Quinn!

30:09.000 --> 30:11.000
- I'm going to the land

30:11.000 --> 30:12.000
to buy some milk.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.000
Do we need anything else?

30:15.000 --> 30:19.000
I say the word "we" without
any attempt to suggest

30:19.000 --> 30:23.000
but there's no point in us
both going separately

30:24.000 --> 30:26.000
It's getting rough
out there.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.000
And increasingly, I think

30:27.000 --> 30:29.000
people like me
who have spent time

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
are thriving
in this new reality.

30:31.000 --> 30:33.000
Oh, you know what, Paxton,
fuck it. Come in.

30:36.000 --> 30:41.000
All right, Paxton, here it is.
In addition to milk,

30:44.000 --> 30:47.000
-What?
-I was trying to hide

30:47.000 --> 30:50.000
but since we're no longer
together, it doesn't really

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
You are smoking?

30:52.000 --> 30:54.000
Yes. I plan to carry on
just until this thing is over.

30:55.000 --> 30:57.000
It's magnificent, actually.

30:57.000 --> 30:59.000
And when did you
start smoking again?

31:00.000 --> 31:01.000
Just before Christmas.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.000
Why?

31:04.000 --> 31:07.000
I started smoking again
when I went to Paris.

31:07.000 --> 31:09.000
-You went to Paris?
-Yes, I went to Paris.

31:09.000 --> 31:10.000
I didn't tell you
I went to Paris.

31:10.000 --> 31:12.000
Michael Essien invited me
to Paris and I went.

31:12.000 --> 31:14.000
Okay, my therapist

31:14.000 --> 31:18.000
identifies these moments
as confession avalanche.

31:20.000 --> 31:22.000
Who the fuck
is Michael Essien?

31:22.000 --> 31:23.000
He is the founder
of Miracore,

31:23.000 --> 31:25.000
seventh wealthiest man
in Germany.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.000
-And you went
to Paris with him?

31:28.000 --> 31:30.000
He invited the CEOs
from six countries

31:30.000 --> 31:32.000
to come to Paris for his
60th birthday celebration.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.000
Do you mind
if I light this thing?

31:34.000 --> 31:37.000
And, you know what?
Actually, it's my choice.

31:44.000 --> 31:46.000
When I got to the hotel,
there was this

31:46.000 --> 31:48.000
and I met six other CEOs
just like me,

31:48.000 --> 31:50.000
only I had just
become a CEO,

31:50.000 --> 31:52.000
so I didn't realize exactly
who I was until I saw

31:52.000 --> 31:56.000
and then I was like,
"Oh, so that's who

31:57.000 --> 31:59.000
And we sat around this table,
drinking champagne,

31:59.000 --> 32:01.000
and the conversation was
lots of little voices

32:01.000 --> 32:04.000
and one big voice
saying "good,"

32:04.000 --> 32:07.000
And then the big voice said,
"Emerging markets" and I...

32:07.000 --> 32:10.000
You know how sometimes
when people say something

32:10.000 --> 32:13.000
Well, we did smoke
a lot of weed

32:13.000 --> 32:18.000
When he said
"Emerging markets,"

32:18.000 --> 32:24.000
thing, this shape appearing
from under the table

32:24.000 --> 32:28.000
I think I actually did
have a temperature that night.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.000
then he said "Cigarettes
and pharmaceuticals,"

32:30.000 --> 32:33.000
and I drank some champagne
and someone

32:33.000 --> 32:37.000
that is people who persuade
governments that products

32:37.000 --> 32:41.000
And the big voice said
that facilitators were now

32:41.000 --> 32:44.000
and I saw this big chain
dripping seaweed

32:44.000 --> 32:47.000
and then the big voice
raised a toast to corruption,

32:47.000 --> 32:50.000
and everybody laughed
ironically, including me.

32:50.000 --> 32:51.000
Paxton, look at me!

32:54.000 --> 32:59.000
And this thing, this shape,
it was swimming around

32:59.000 --> 33:01.000
and then the big voice said,
emerging market

33:01.000 --> 33:03.000
were now some big percentage
of Miracore's profits,

33:03.000 --> 33:06.000
and so there would have to be
rationalization in Europe.

33:06.000 --> 33:08.000
And I drank some water,
because I felt a little sick,

33:08.000 --> 33:10.000
but also like I might pass out,
but then the waiter said

33:10.000 --> 33:15.000
And, so, the rationalization
was planned right there

33:15.000 --> 33:17.000
at that table in Paris
before Christmas.

33:17.000 --> 33:20.000
And the nice people
that I fired earlier today,

33:20.000 --> 33:23.000
they weren't fired because
of a virus, like I told them,

33:23.000 --> 33:26.000
that was a lie. They were fired
because of this...

33:26.000 --> 33:27.000
this thing, this shape,

33:27.000 --> 33:30.000
that swam with me
all the way back to my room,

33:30.000 --> 33:35.000
and to get rid of it, I used
the disgusting glass swan

33:35.000 --> 33:37.000
and rather then
walk across broken

33:37.000 --> 33:39.000
I decided to take
the last train home

33:39.000 --> 33:41.000
and when I got
to the Gare du Nord station,

33:41.000 --> 33:43.000
a homeless woman came up to me
and asked me for a cigarette.

33:43.000 --> 33:45.000
I told her that I didn't smoke,
but I decided to buy her

33:45.000 --> 33:48.000
because I thought that maybe
kindness might make me

33:48.000 --> 33:50.000
about what I had become.
And when she lit

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
I decided
to have a cigarette, too.

33:53.000 --> 33:55.000
And when I drew in
the smoke,

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
the thing stopped swimming.

34:00.000 --> 34:04.000
So I sat down on the bench
and I waited for my train.

34:05.000 --> 34:08.000
And that is why
I started to smoke again.

34:12.000 --> 34:16.000
But... to complete the answer
to your original question,

34:16.000 --> 34:19.000
in addition to milk
and cigarettes, we need bread

34:20.000 --> 34:22.000
and fucking wine.

34:25.000 --> 34:27.000
God!

34:27.000 --> 34:29.000
God what?

34:29.000 --> 34:31.000
Well, it sounds like
you did have a temperature.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
You know, they say this thing
was around before Christmas.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.000
Paxton, no!
It's not about the virus.

34:35.000 --> 34:39.000
It's about me realizing
who I am and what I do

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
Although a complete
re-examination of one's life

34:43.000 --> 34:44.000
does seem to be
a COVID side effect.

34:45.000 --> 34:47.000
-You smashed a mirror?
-Yeah.

34:47.000 --> 34:48.000
Yeah, because I was in it.

34:48.000 --> 34:50.000
I also smashed
a champagne bottle,

34:50.000 --> 34:52.000
some champagne glasses,
and I was about to smash

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
but then
I decided to keep it,

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
but then I left it
on the fucking train.

34:56.000 --> 35:00.000
Basically, I went, what you
used to call, "Full Viking."

35:00.000 --> 35:01.000
In fact,
when I broke the mirror

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
and I saw my furious face
in the cracked glass,

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
-I thought of you.
- That's very sweet.

35:10.000 --> 35:12.000
Why didn't you tell me?

35:15.000 --> 35:19.000
It was the onset of winter.
Our winter.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.000
And anyway,
I didn't tell anybody,

35:21.000 --> 35:25.000
because if you
don't tell anybody,

35:25.000 --> 35:28.000
-Did you get a bill
for the mirror?

35:28.000 --> 35:31.000
Paxton, fuck the mirror.
It's not about the mirror,

35:38.000 --> 35:40.000
Previously, at this point,

35:40.000 --> 35:43.000
-I would've hugged you.
-No, really,

35:43.000 --> 35:44.000
And anyway, besides,
you're going shopping.

35:45.000 --> 35:50.000
So, uh, milk, bread,
wine, cigarettes.

35:50.000 --> 35:53.000
-And probably eggs.
-I'm gonna put white flour

35:53.000 --> 35:55.000
I'm gonna make bread.

35:55.000 --> 35:57.000
-Please don't.
-You know...

35:58.000 --> 36:01.000
what you just said
wasn't a confession.

36:01.000 --> 36:03.000
I didn't say
it was a confession.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.000
'Cause you didn't do
anything wrong.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.000
No, it was an explanation.

36:06.000 --> 36:07.000
You did everything right.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.000
You wanna hear a confession?

36:11.000 --> 36:17.000
This morning I overslept,
because last night

36:18.000 --> 36:20.000
Yes!

36:20.000 --> 36:22.000
Yes.

36:22.000 --> 36:24.000
Much worse
than your cigarettes.

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
I licked opium off little
green bulbs from the garden.

36:28.000 --> 36:30.000
-No, you didn't.
-Yes, I did.

36:30.000 --> 36:31.000
Our garden
is full of heroin.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.000
You go beyond the washing line,
it's like the Helmand Province.

36:33.000 --> 36:35.000
After ten years, Paxton?

36:36.000 --> 36:37.000
Smoking isn't
so great either.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.000
You know, I've had
some setbacks lately.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.000
Yeah, well,
you know what, Paxton?

36:42.000 --> 36:44.000
You know that green smoothie
that I have in the mornings

36:44.000 --> 36:45.000
there's two shots
of vodka in it.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.000
-Just two but--
-You are lying.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.000
No, I'm not.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.000
Not every morning,
but some mornings I do it.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.000
You think I'm so happy
and normal is 'cause

36:54.000 --> 36:56.000
People get confused.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.000
No, I've never accused you
of being happy

36:58.000 --> 37:03.000
'Cause I'm not! All right?
I see concepts.

37:03.000 --> 37:04.000
I should've been an artist.

37:04.000 --> 37:06.000
You are unhappy
in an outwardly "happy,

37:06.000 --> 37:08.000
let's pretend it's all fine"
female way,

37:08.000 --> 37:11.000
and I am unhappy
in an obviously thwarted,

37:11.000 --> 37:13.000
-unfulfilled, castrated
male way.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.000
Do not go down
this road again, okay?

37:15.000 --> 37:19.000
Just go to the store.
Milk, bread, wine,

37:19.000 --> 37:21.000
Yeah, and fuck you,
I'm buying flour.

37:21.000 --> 37:23.000
Fine! Wait.
Do you have a mask?

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
No, I don't
have a mask, no.

37:29.000 --> 37:32.000
Well, you'll have to tie
something around

37:41.000 --> 37:43.000
Fuck!

37:45.000 --> 37:46.000
My old bandana.

37:47.000 --> 37:50.000
Hmm. Yeah, well,
it's no longer

37:50.000 --> 37:51.000
It's now government advice.

38:01.000 --> 38:05.000
You were wearing that
when I met you in Sturgis,

38:06.000 --> 38:08.000
I thought you looked
like a desperado.

38:08.000 --> 38:11.000
No, I was just trying
to get the dust

38:11.000 --> 38:12.000
Don't spoil it.

38:15.000 --> 38:18.000
Don't forget the milk
and the eggs, Desperado.

38:40.000 --> 38:42.000
Oi! Move forward.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.000
Oi!

38:44.000 --> 38:46.000
Go ahead then.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.000
Fuck off.

38:51.000 --> 38:52.000
Oi. How many asses
have you got?

38:52.000 --> 38:53.000
Fuck off!

39:42.000 --> 39:44.000
Paxton.

39:46.000 --> 39:50.000
Hearing the story about Paris
out loud, it made me think...

39:50.000 --> 39:53.000
When lockdown's over,
I'm going to think about

39:56.000 --> 39:57.000
Why are you telling me?

40:23.000 --> 40:24.000
You called?

40:24.000 --> 40:25.000
Oh, Lord who art in heaven,
I beseech you,

40:26.000 --> 40:27.000
look favorably upon
Paxton and myself

40:27.000 --> 40:29.000
and forgive us
the sin of deception

40:29.000 --> 40:31.000
which we are jointly
about to commit

40:31.000 --> 40:33.000
in pursuit of his ultimate
redemption. Amen.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.000
Amen.

40:37.000 --> 40:38.000
Every prayer is tailored
to suit the person

40:39.000 --> 40:41.000
Either it's me writing
the words or it's Jesus.

40:42.000 --> 40:44.000
What do you want, Malcolm?

40:44.000 --> 40:45.000
I've got your fake ID sorted.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.000
Virginia is delivering
the ID card.

40:48.000 --> 40:50.000
I wanted to make sure
you'd be in.

40:50.000 --> 40:52.000
You know what, Malcolm?
Everybody's in.

40:52.000 --> 40:54.000
And I've sent you
your new name.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.000
I texted it to you.
It's on your phone.

40:56.000 --> 40:58.000
Okay.

40:58.000 --> 41:02.000
A new name for the beginning
of a new life.

41:03.000 --> 41:06.000
And my new name is...

41:10.000 --> 41:11.000
Edgar Allen Poe.

41:11.000 --> 41:13.000
Yeah.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Yeah, uh...

41:17.000 --> 41:20.000
Yeah. Malcolm, I obviously
can't use this name.

41:20.000 --> 41:21.000
Why not?

41:21.000 --> 41:22.000
I'm hoping this is a joke,

41:22.000 --> 41:24.000
but I know you,
so it's probably not.

41:24.000 --> 41:25.000
What joke?

41:26.000 --> 41:28.000
Okay.

41:28.000 --> 41:30.000
Edgar Allan Poe is the name
of a famous,

41:30.000 --> 41:32.000
like a...

41:32.000 --> 41:34.000
like a very famous
American novelist and poet.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.000
Never heard of him.

41:36.000 --> 41:37.000
Well, I assure you,

41:37.000 --> 41:41.000
Edgar Allan Poe is actually
a very famous

41:41.000 --> 41:43.000
American writer
who I'm actually

41:43.000 --> 41:44.000
It was me that came up
with Edgar.

41:45.000 --> 41:46.000
It's my grandad's name.

41:46.000 --> 41:48.000
So who came up
with the "Allen Poe" part?

41:48.000 --> 41:49.000
Martin in dispatch.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.000
Fuck.

41:51.000 --> 41:53.000
Martin in dispatch
hates me.

41:53.000 --> 41:56.000
He's deliberately
suggested this

41:56.000 --> 41:57.000
and unbearable.

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
Well, the card's
already been laminated.

41:59.000 --> 42:02.000
Malcolm, I can't go into
expensive department stores

42:02.000 --> 42:03.000
in the West End, right,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.000
and expect them
to entrust me

42:05.000 --> 42:07.000
with valuable clothing
and jewelry,

42:07.000 --> 42:10.000
and tell them that my name
is Edgar Allen fucking Poe!

42:11.000 --> 42:13.000
If he's so famous,
how come I've never

42:13.000 --> 42:15.000
'Cause you don't
read books!

42:15.000 --> 42:16.000
I read the Good Book.

42:17.000 --> 42:18.000
But he's not
in the Bible, obviously.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.000
Anybody here ever heard
of a writer

42:20.000 --> 42:22.000
called Edgar Allan Poe?

42:23.000 --> 42:25.000
No?

42:25.000 --> 42:26.000
No one. There you go.

42:26.000 --> 42:27.000
I know there's
no one there.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.000
They are all
working from home.

42:29.000 --> 42:30.000
Martin's here.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.000
This was his idea!

42:32.000 --> 42:34.000
Well, the card's
already been laminated.

42:36.000 --> 42:38.000
All right, look, I grant you
that 90%

42:38.000 --> 42:40.000
of the security guards
working the night shift

42:40.000 --> 42:41.000
in the West End
would not have heard

42:42.000 --> 42:43.000
of Edgar Allan Poe.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.000
Basically dealing with robots.

42:44.000 --> 42:46.000
But I am an unlucky person.

42:46.000 --> 42:49.000
Fate has a way
of doing these little

42:49.000 --> 42:51.000
Card's already laminated

42:51.000 --> 42:53.000
and Martin has
a new name badge

42:53.000 --> 42:55.000
It's all in the envelope.

42:55.000 --> 42:56.000
By some chance,

42:56.000 --> 42:58.000
choosing the name
of a gloomy,

42:58.000 --> 43:02.000
introspective peddler
of darkness is actually

43:02.000 --> 43:03.000
to my character,
but please...

43:05.000 --> 43:08.000
just give me a new card
under a different name.

43:08.000 --> 43:10.000
The robots don't give
a fuck about the name,

43:11.000 --> 43:12.000
they just look
at the photo.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.000
You are due at Selfridges'
loading bay B

43:14.000 --> 43:15.000
at 1800 hours tonight.

43:15.000 --> 43:17.000
Wear your uniform
with your name tag.

43:18.000 --> 43:19.000
Flash your ID.

43:19.000 --> 43:23.000
Look, if you want
to back out,

43:23.000 --> 43:24.000
I can't get into
trouble again, all right?

43:24.000 --> 43:28.000
This could be construed
as deception

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
and attempted robbery.

43:29.000 --> 43:30.000
You counted me down,

43:30.000 --> 43:33.000
I'll count you down,
you fucker.

43:33.000 --> 43:37.000
Five, four, three, two...

43:37.000 --> 43:39.000
Fuck! All right, all right.
I'll do it.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
Good.

43:41.000 --> 43:44.000
Details are on the text.
God bless you, Paxton.

43:58.000 --> 44:00.000
No need to sign.
I know him.

44:01.000 --> 44:02.000
Are you his other half?

44:03.000 --> 44:04.000
Yes, yes, I am.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.000
He's so dry,
isn't he?

44:08.000 --> 44:10.000
Hello, Paxton.

44:10.000 --> 44:12.000
I was just saying
you're very funny.

44:12.000 --> 44:14.000
Yes, I am.
I am hilarious.

44:15.000 --> 44:17.000
We think
he's too clever

44:17.000 --> 44:19.000
We don't know why
he doesn't get

44:19.000 --> 44:21.000
Well, that's easy.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.000
It's 'cause ten years ago,
I beat a man senseless

44:23.000 --> 44:24.000
in a bikers' roadhouse
in Watford.

44:24.000 --> 44:25.000
See?

44:25.000 --> 44:28.000
He's always saying
silly things.

44:28.000 --> 44:30.000
He's so dry.

44:30.000 --> 44:32.000
Give my regards
to Martin,

44:32.000 --> 44:34.000
Mmm-hmm.
-Tell him

44:34.000 --> 44:36.000
Okay.

44:36.000 --> 44:37.000
See you when
the madness is over.

44:37.000 --> 44:40.000
Yeah, well, for some of us,
the madness never ends.

44:47.000 --> 44:49.000
Never forget,
the man you beat senseless

44:49.000 --> 44:51.000
Please don't talk about
people deserving things.

44:52.000 --> 44:54.000
If it wasn't for you,
a little man called

44:54.000 --> 44:56.000
What you want,
justice next?

44:56.000 --> 44:59.000
I know that you had
a bad break,

44:59.000 --> 45:00.000
-but going forward--
-"Going forward"?

45:01.000 --> 45:02.000
When lockdown is over
and we are apart,

45:02.000 --> 45:04.000
you have to stop believing
that fate is against you.

45:04.000 --> 45:06.000
You have to stop believing
the name Paxton

45:06.000 --> 45:08.000
is a precursor of doom.

45:08.000 --> 45:10.000
Yes, well,
my name isn't Paxton.

45:13.000 --> 45:14.000
Yeah.

45:31.000 --> 45:35.000
Paxton, you can't
go through with this,

45:35.000 --> 45:37.000
If you're doing it for cash,
I'll give you the cash.

45:37.000 --> 45:38.000
I am not doing it
for the cash.

45:38.000 --> 45:42.000
I'm doing it
for the opportunity

45:42.000 --> 45:44.000
But why am I telling you?

45:50.000 --> 45:53.000
Fuck.

45:57.000 --> 45:58.000
Paxton.

46:20.000 --> 46:22.000
Oh!

46:25.000 --> 46:26.000
Oh.

46:33.000 --> 46:34.000
Fuck 'em.

46:37.000 --> 46:40.000
And Linda seemed
kind of detached

46:40.000 --> 46:41.000
Hey.

46:42.000 --> 46:43.000
Detached?

46:44.000 --> 46:45.000
Hi, Linda.

46:45.000 --> 46:46.000
We were talking about you.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.000
We were all just saying

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
that we love that
you're always so professional.

46:49.000 --> 46:51.000
Detached from what
whole thing?

46:51.000 --> 46:53.000
I was saying
you handled the situation

46:53.000 --> 46:56.000
with Events without too much
feeling getting in the way.

46:57.000 --> 46:58.000
You fired them well.

47:00.000 --> 47:02.000
I did. Thank you.

47:02.000 --> 47:03.000
Good.

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
Linda, is that
a glass of wine?

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
Oh, yes, yeah, it is.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.000
Well...

47:11.000 --> 47:13.000
it says wine on the label

47:13.000 --> 47:15.000
but it tastes like something
used to clean something

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
Paxton chose it.

47:16.000 --> 47:17.000
Who's Paxton?

47:17.000 --> 47:19.000
Mmm, anyway...

47:19.000 --> 47:21.000
we have a problem,
so shall we get on?

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
Hello, Martin.

47:30.000 --> 47:32.000
Hello, Edgar.

47:32.000 --> 47:33.000
You know,
from my observation of you

47:34.000 --> 47:35.000
since I joined the company,

47:35.000 --> 47:38.000
you represent the longest
and most well-managed

47:38.000 --> 47:40.000
nervous breakdown
in history.

47:40.000 --> 47:43.000
Why don't you go
somewhere warm

47:43.000 --> 47:45.000
I've disinfected the van
for you.

47:45.000 --> 47:48.000
Everything you need
is in there.

47:48.000 --> 47:52.000
You know, when Malcolm
told me he was giving you

47:52.000 --> 47:54.000
I advised him against it.

47:54.000 --> 47:56.000
B2B normally keep
lowlifes like you

47:56.000 --> 47:59.000
away from high-value cargo
for a reason...

47:59.000 --> 48:00.000
Temptation.

48:01.000 --> 48:03.000
You forgot to put the keys
to the van inside the envelope,

48:04.000 --> 48:07.000
I've read your
human resources profile.

48:07.000 --> 48:10.000
My personal record is meant
to be confidential,

48:11.000 --> 48:13.000
but for your
personal record, Martin,

48:13.000 --> 48:15.000
I'm a different person now.
Give me the fucking keys.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.000
Perhaps Malcolm
didn't tell you.

48:17.000 --> 48:18.000
The estimated value
of tonight's cargo

48:19.000 --> 48:22.000
out of Selfridges
is £50,000.

48:22.000 --> 48:25.000
The value of your collection
from Harvey Nichols on Friday

48:25.000 --> 48:26.000
is just under £100,000.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.000
But on Saturday night,

48:28.000 --> 48:30.000
when you go to Harrods,

48:30.000 --> 48:33.000
you'll be driving away
from the world's most glamorous

48:33.000 --> 48:35.000
with jewelry and accessories
in your van

48:35.000 --> 48:37.000
worth over
three million pounds.

48:38.000 --> 48:39.000
Now think on this.

48:39.000 --> 48:41.000
You'll be wearing
a mask and gloves,

48:41.000 --> 48:43.000
you'll be using
a false identity.

48:43.000 --> 48:45.000
Outside, the streets
will be empty.

48:45.000 --> 48:46.000
Store security
on quarter staff

48:46.000 --> 48:48.000
with big holes
caused by absences.

48:48.000 --> 48:50.000
What more could
a lowlife need

48:50.000 --> 48:52.000
to pull off
the perfect robbery.

48:52.000 --> 48:54.000
You refer to me as "lowlife"
one more time...

48:54.000 --> 48:56.000
You'll what?
Revert to type.

48:56.000 --> 48:59.000
Okay, here goes,
one more time.

48:59.000 --> 49:01.000
Lowlife.

49:01.000 --> 49:04.000
You know, Malcolm told me
that if you do okay

49:04.000 --> 49:06.000
he's gonna put you
in customer services.

49:06.000 --> 49:09.000
Goin' out
and meeting clients.

49:09.000 --> 49:10.000
'Cause you're so funny

49:10.000 --> 49:13.000
and you're so dry
and you make

49:13.000 --> 49:15.000
Whereas I've been stuck
in dispatches

49:15.000 --> 49:16.000
for seven and a half years.

49:16.000 --> 49:19.000
You have to stop thinking
the whole world's

49:23.000 --> 49:25.000
Do it, Paxton.

49:25.000 --> 49:28.000
Take the opportunity
that fate has given you.

49:36.000 --> 49:39.000
Exactly how much product
do Eve Schwarz

49:39.000 --> 49:42.000
Uh, approximately
three million pounds'

49:42.000 --> 49:43.000
Harrods wants everything
out of the store

49:44.000 --> 49:45.000
and it's
our responsibility...

49:45.000 --> 49:47.000
Oh, you've frozen, Linda.

49:48.000 --> 49:50.000
Can you hear me?

49:50.000 --> 49:52.000
Yeah, I can hear you,
just your face is frozen.

49:52.000 --> 49:56.000
You've got this look
of exasperation.

49:56.000 --> 50:00.000
Uh, someone's gonna
have to go into Harrods

50:00.000 --> 50:03.000
and check the inventory
and count everything out.

50:03.000 --> 50:05.000
And it's gonna have
to be someone that we trust.

50:05.000 --> 50:07.000
Someone who is familiar
with the stock,

50:07.000 --> 50:09.000
and knows how
the Harrods system works.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.000
So that means, inevitably,
it's going to be me, isn't it?

50:11.000 --> 50:13.000
Okay, but there's this,
another second reason

50:14.000 --> 50:17.000
Michael Essien has decided.
He wants to give you

50:17.000 --> 50:19.000
He wants to bring you home.

50:19.000 --> 50:22.000
Back to New York
to run the East Coast.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.000
Uh...

50:25.000 --> 50:26.000
Wow, God. Um...

50:27.000 --> 50:28.000
Exciting.

50:28.000 --> 50:29.000
A unexpected
turn of events

50:29.000 --> 50:31.000
and cheap wine
don't pair well together.

50:31.000 --> 50:34.000
Um, I'm gonna have to, uh,
really think about this.

50:34.000 --> 50:37.000
Uh, right, good night.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.000
Yeah, thank you.

50:39.000 --> 50:41.000
Linda, it's exciting--
-

50:45.000 --> 50:48.000
A frozen look
of exasperation.

50:48.000 --> 50:53.000
...and that is his second son,

50:53.000 --> 50:55.000
and here's his  Symphony No. 4.

51:55.000 --> 51:57.000
It's just that after
our call last night,

51:57.000 --> 51:59.000
we became worried about
Paxton's state of mind.

51:59.000 --> 52:01.000
We worry that
he might implode or explode.

52:01.000 --> 52:03.000
Knowing Paxton,
he'll probably implode

52:04.000 --> 52:05.000
What's the difference?

52:05.000 --> 52:08.000
When you implode,
you withdraw

52:08.000 --> 52:10.000
when you explode,
you impose yourself

52:10.000 --> 52:12.000
David, for example,
when he gets angry,

52:12.000 --> 52:14.000
When I get angry,
I explode.

52:14.000 --> 52:16.000
-I can also explode
if I have to.

52:16.000 --> 52:17.000
You've obviously
never seen me

52:17.000 --> 52:20.000
Well, actually I have.
Since lockdown.

52:20.000 --> 52:21.000
You've heard me
through the wall,

52:22.000 --> 52:23.000
Okay, then,
I haven't heard you explode.

52:23.000 --> 52:25.000
I've actually been
very surprised

52:25.000 --> 52:27.000
about how submissive you are
in meetings.

52:27.000 --> 52:29.000
-Submissive?
-You're the boss, David,

52:29.000 --> 52:32.000
-Anyway, just to reassure you,
Paxton's okay.

52:32.000 --> 52:34.000
In fact, Paxton maybe
getting a promotion.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.000
Linda, are you
drinking alone?

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
No, I've got three firemen
waiting for me in the kitchen.

52:40.000 --> 52:43.000
Since lockdown, David has
been drinking so much more.

52:43.000 --> 52:47.000
Yes, David,
isn't it wonderful?

52:47.000 --> 52:49.000
We now keep a record.
We count the bottles.

52:49.000 --> 52:51.000
-I don't care.
-Your body cares.

52:52.000 --> 52:54.000
Your body counts the bottles
and keeps an inventory

52:54.000 --> 52:58.000
David, my fellow drinker,
I'd like to tell you

52:58.000 --> 53:01.000
-What secret?
-You know, Linda,

53:01.000 --> 53:03.000
there have been
many occasions

53:03.000 --> 53:05.000
where I've had
a few glasses of wine

53:05.000 --> 53:08.000
I woke up like,
"Golly. Wow.

53:08.000 --> 53:11.000
Oh, I've done that
so many times, too.

53:11.000 --> 53:13.000
You know, my mantra is,
secrets and wine

53:13.000 --> 53:15.000
-don't go great together.
-Let her tell me the secret.

53:15.000 --> 53:17.000
I think he's gonna
like this secret.

53:17.000 --> 53:18.000
I think you're gonna
like this secret, David,

53:18.000 --> 53:20.000
Something he's gonna like,
you don't know.

53:20.000 --> 53:22.000
-No, he might not.
-What the fuck are you two

53:22.000 --> 53:24.000
The secret is this.
-He might not be in a place

53:24.000 --> 53:25.000
where it's okay.
He watches Fox.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.000
It is I who am buying
Paxton's motorbike.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.000
What?

53:32.000 --> 53:33.000
When he said he was
selling it,

53:33.000 --> 53:35.000
I arranged a dealer
to buy it anonymously.

53:35.000 --> 53:37.000
I'm gonna buy it
and give it back to him.

53:38.000 --> 53:39.000
My parting gift.

53:45.000 --> 53:47.000
For a while I've known
I had to leave him.

53:47.000 --> 53:48.000
But...

53:50.000 --> 53:53.000
But losing the bike, yeah,
that's too much.

53:55.000 --> 53:56.000
And the bike means
something to me, too.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.000
You know, youth.

53:59.000 --> 54:04.000
Cigarettes. Bad, bad wine
chosen by Paxton.

54:09.000 --> 54:10.000
Wow, that's--
-Linda, that's awesome.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.000
But here's the thing, David.
I want you to tell him

54:12.000 --> 54:14.000
that it's you
who is buying the bike

54:14.000 --> 54:16.000
and giving it back to him.
I don't want him to know

54:18.000 --> 54:19.000
Why?

54:21.000 --> 54:22.000
It'll hurt him less.

54:23.000 --> 54:25.000
He really
is quite prehistoric.

54:27.000 --> 54:29.000
I'm a bit drunk
and I hate people

54:29.000 --> 54:31.000
who get emotional
on these things, so...

54:54.000 --> 54:55.000
Fuck.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.000
Making noise
for the NHS.

55:15.000 --> 55:18.000
We've got Beethoven's

55:28.000 --> 55:30.000
Whoo!
-

55:37.000 --> 55:38.000
Whoo!

56:05.000 --> 56:06.000
Hey.

56:08.000 --> 56:10.000
Couldn't sleep.

56:10.000 --> 56:13.000
If the wine didn't work,
go and lick the garden.

56:13.000 --> 56:15.000
How was it tonight?

56:17.000 --> 56:20.000
Every security person I met
was under the age of 12,

56:20.000 --> 56:23.000
and every one of them
was too busy

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
to fully acknowledge my ID.

56:25.000 --> 56:28.000
Anyway, I think
for the young generation,

56:28.000 --> 56:32.000
I could have had an ID card
with William Shakespeare

56:32.000 --> 56:34.000
How many more
pick-ups do you have?

56:34.000 --> 56:37.000
Um, tomorrow,
Harvey Nichols

56:37.000 --> 56:39.000
and then,
Saturday, Harrods.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.000
Harrods?
Saturday night?

56:43.000 --> 56:45.000
It's all gone mad
out there.

56:45.000 --> 56:48.000
One of the security guards
was telling me about

56:49.000 --> 56:52.000
are taking out diamond rings
and watches in plastic bags

56:53.000 --> 56:54.000
and getting into Ubers.

56:54.000 --> 56:56.000
What are you
taking out of Harrods?

56:56.000 --> 56:58.000
I don't know.

56:58.000 --> 57:00.000
Martin says
it's over three million

57:00.000 --> 57:02.000
No co-drivers
'cause of COVID.

57:02.000 --> 57:04.000
Carrying it to where?

57:04.000 --> 57:08.000
Uh, the docket says Heathrow.
Ten o'clock flight

57:08.000 --> 57:10.000
Harrods to Heathrow,
Saturday night,

57:10.000 --> 57:13.000
three million pounds,
ten o'clock flight.

57:13.000 --> 57:15.000
Look, there's the hedgehog.

57:17.000 --> 57:19.000
Oh, no, he's gone.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
Ah, he's gone.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.000
How was your evening?

57:26.000 --> 57:28.000
Okay, um, Paxton.
Here it is.

57:28.000 --> 57:31.000
You can't
do that pick-up

57:31.000 --> 57:34.000
You really can't.

57:34.000 --> 57:35.000
What are you talking about?

57:35.000 --> 57:37.000
Okay, do you remember
once I asked you,

57:37.000 --> 57:38.000
do you believe in God,
and you said that

57:39.000 --> 57:42.000
you believe that he's busy
on another project,

57:42.000 --> 57:43.000
but occasionally
he puts his head

57:43.000 --> 57:45.000
Well, I think this may be
one of those occasions,

57:45.000 --> 57:49.000
'cause God or fate or the virus
or somebody put our paths

57:51.000 --> 57:53.000
On Saturday, I will be
in Harrods packing up

57:53.000 --> 57:55.000
that you are due to carry.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.000
Fuck.

57:56.000 --> 57:58.000
What are you
talkin' about? I...

57:59.000 --> 58:01.000
I have to do the pick-up.

58:01.000 --> 58:03.000
If you do,
you will be caught.

58:03.000 --> 58:05.000
It doesn't matter
what name you're using.

58:05.000 --> 58:06.000
It's a fake name
and I have implemented

58:06.000 --> 58:08.000
You won't make it
past the door.

58:08.000 --> 58:12.000
I know,
because it's my system

58:18.000 --> 58:21.000
I'm sorry. And what the fuck,
don't even begin.

58:21.000 --> 58:24.000
I can't fucking
get anywhere!

58:29.000 --> 58:31.000
I mean...

58:31.000 --> 58:33.000
Can't you just tell them
that you know me?

58:33.000 --> 58:34.000
That...

58:34.000 --> 58:37.000
That you know
I can be trusted.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
That I was your partner.

58:45.000 --> 58:46.000
-What?
-It doesn't work like that.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.000
And I...

58:50.000 --> 58:52.000
Since joining Miracore
three years ago,

58:52.000 --> 58:55.000
I haven't told anyone
I have a partner.

58:55.000 --> 58:58.000
Partly because I wanted
to keep work separate.

58:58.000 --> 59:00.000
Yeah, but mostly because
you were embarrassed

59:00.000 --> 59:01.000
to have a partner
that drives a van.

59:04.000 --> 59:06.000
Yes. All of the above.
I...

59:07.000 --> 59:09.000
But now,
I am looking at myself.

59:09.000 --> 59:11.000
Since lockdown,
I'm looking back at myself

59:11.000 --> 59:12.000
like that was then
and this is now.

59:12.000 --> 59:14.000
Well, good for you, Linda,

59:14.000 --> 59:16.000
but if I don't
make this collection

59:16.000 --> 59:19.000
then, not only will Malcolm
not promote me,

59:19.000 --> 59:21.000
he will fire me.

59:22.000 --> 59:25.000
I could always
start dealing heroin.

59:26.000 --> 59:27.000
Lowlife is lowlife.

59:30.000 --> 59:34.000
No job. No bike.

59:36.000 --> 59:37.000
No you.

59:49.000 --> 59:53.000
When I worked at Harrods,
I had so much fun.

59:53.000 --> 59:55.000
I knew everyone.
Everyone knew me.

59:55.000 --> 59:57.000
Most of them
still work there--

59:57.000 --> 59:58.000
Is there any possibility
we might get back to me

59:58.000 --> 1:00:00.000
I mean, I'm the one
whose life is fucked.

1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:01.000
No, no, this is about you.

1:00:01.000 --> 1:00:03.000
All right, I know
all the security guards,

1:00:03.000 --> 1:00:06.000
-I know the security systems.
-So?

1:00:06.000 --> 1:00:08.000
So there is a way for you
to make your pick-up

1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:09.000
and deliver to Heathrow
without getting caught.

1:00:10.000 --> 1:00:12.000
You will get your promotion
and I will get

1:00:12.000 --> 1:00:13.000
and no one will know.

1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:15.000
But we will be
breaking the law.

1:00:15.000 --> 1:00:20.000
So you're gonna have to do
absolutely everything

1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:46.000
Michael Morgan.
Acting Deputy Head,

1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:48.000
Yes, you are
in my old department.

1:00:48.000 --> 1:00:50.000
How's life at Harrods?

1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:52.000
I only just joined.
I used to be

1:00:52.000 --> 1:00:54.000
Oh, quite a change then.

1:00:54.000 --> 1:00:57.000
Not really. No, Harrods
is like a big ship.

1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:58.000
Oh. Okay.

1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:01.000
I mean, there are,
obviously, huge differences.

1:01:01.000 --> 1:01:03.000
Of course.

1:01:03.000 --> 1:01:04.000
Yeah, and not just in terms
of the shape of the building

1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:07.000
or the fact that
it doesn't float.

1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:09.000
-You know, it's...
-Oh, yeah.

1:01:09.000 --> 1:01:12.000
Yeah, the working environment
must be very different,

1:01:12.000 --> 1:01:14.000
Yes, it is.
Lot of women here.

1:01:14.000 --> 1:01:16.000
-Yeah.
-Yes.

1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:17.000
Yeah, on the ship,
there was only four.

1:01:18.000 --> 1:01:19.000
And, uh, two of them
were called Karen.

1:01:19.000 --> 1:01:21.000
Called them Karen one
and Karen two.

1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000
I think Kate's
meant to be joining us?

1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:25.000
-Kate Smith,
yes, from Events.

1:01:25.000 --> 1:01:26.000
When I knew her,
she was Kate Wiley.

1:01:26.000 --> 1:01:28.000
She must have
gotten married.

1:01:28.000 --> 1:01:30.000
Yeah, she did get married,
yeah, but it all went

1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000
Oh, sorry to hear that.

1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:34.000
What happened?

1:01:34.000 --> 1:01:35.000
I don't know.
They don't talk to me

1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:37.000
-Linda!

1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:39.000
Katie!

1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:40.000
Oh my God,
Oh, my God. How are you?

1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:43.000
Oh, my gosh. You know,
I'm surviving.

1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:44.000
Linda, you have gone off
like a rocket!

1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:45.000
-Oh, stop.
-I mean, my God.

1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:47.000
When they said
CEO Miracore,

1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:49.000
I thought, "Okay, God,
some bald man,"

1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:51.000
-but then I saw your name.
-

1:01:51.000 --> 1:01:54.000
Linda was just asking
what went wrong

1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:57.000
-  was just askin'.
-No. No, no, no.

1:01:57.000 --> 1:01:59.000
When a man is shorter
than you

1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:00.000
and then suddenly decides

1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:02.000
to let his beard grow
very, very long

1:02:02.000 --> 1:02:05.000
and then becomes obsessed
with so called "white magic,"

1:02:05.000 --> 1:02:07.000
it can just get very creepy
very quickly.

1:02:07.000 --> 1:02:09.000
-Anyway, what can we

1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:11.000
I have an update about
the Eve Schwarz clear-out

1:02:11.000 --> 1:02:13.000
You see, all the secure
freight companies

1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.000
and it looks like
our logistics department

1:02:15.000 --> 1:02:17.000
Eve Schwarz, Miracore.
Here it is.

1:02:17.000 --> 1:02:19.000
They've booked
a freight company that

1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:20.000
so that's why I'm anxious.

1:02:20.000 --> 1:02:23.000
Lime green is the color
and, uh...

1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:24.000
So you're anxious
about the freight company?

1:02:24.000 --> 1:02:26.000
It's gonna be
green arrows pointing--

1:02:26.000 --> 1:02:28.000
So if it's okay with you,

1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:29.000
I know the Harrods
security system

1:02:29.000 --> 1:02:31.000
and I'd like
to run the checks

1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:33.000
Oh, no, no,
that's Imran's job.

1:02:33.000 --> 1:02:35.000
Do you remember Imran, Linda?

1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:36.000
I love Imran...

1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:37.000
Imran is now head
of Events security.

1:02:37.000 --> 1:02:39.000
He's Michael's boss.

1:02:39.000 --> 1:02:40.000
You got any questions.
I can handle everything.

1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:41.000
Let me text him now.

1:02:41.000 --> 1:02:42.000
Don't, I'm gonna be the one
with the arrows. So...

1:02:45.000 --> 1:02:47.000
Okay. Done.

1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:48.000
Tomorrow, I'll run you
through the system myself

1:02:48.000 --> 1:02:49.000
and then get you
into the store.

1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:50.000
After that,
what can go wrong?

1:02:50.000 --> 1:02:53.000
Hey, great. Thanks.

1:02:53.000 --> 1:02:55.000
I really appreciate
you doing this for me.

1:02:58.000 --> 1:03:00.000
-What's the matter?
-I don't know.

1:03:00.000 --> 1:03:02.000
Days are passing quickly.

1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:05.000
When I woke up this morning,

1:03:05.000 --> 1:03:08.000
it really hit me
for the first time.

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:10.000
The reality of what's
happening hit me.

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:14.000
The lockdown
will eventually end.

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:16.000
Then...

1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:20.000
the love of my life
will be gone.

1:03:22.000 --> 1:03:25.000
Paxton, you will move on
from this. You will heal.

1:03:25.000 --> 1:03:28.000
There'll be a huge hole
in my life.

1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:32.000
You'll change and grow.
And...

1:03:34.000 --> 1:03:36.000
Eventually you'll...

1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:37.000
you'll meet someone else.

1:03:43.000 --> 1:03:46.000
You were talking about
the bike, weren't you?

1:03:46.000 --> 1:03:48.000
Yeah. Why?

1:03:49.000 --> 1:03:54.000
The bike is one
of the loves of my life.

1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:55.000
And I am one of the holes?

1:03:55.000 --> 1:03:57.000
Obviously you're
the biggest hole.

1:03:57.000 --> 1:03:58.000
Oh, why, thank you.

1:04:00.000 --> 1:04:02.000
I was gonna take
the bike out today.

1:04:02.000 --> 1:04:05.000
The streets
are completely deserted.

1:04:06.000 --> 1:04:08.000
I was gonna call it
"Lockdown-one-last-ride."

1:04:09.000 --> 1:04:10.000
I thought maybe...

1:04:11.000 --> 1:04:14.000
Oh, no, I can't
go with you, Paxton.

1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:16.000
No. I have
an important meeting.

1:04:20.000 --> 1:04:23.000
An open road
and a broken heart.

1:04:25.000 --> 1:04:26.000
Don't kill yourself.

1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:33.000
-Linda!
-Michael.

1:04:34.000 --> 1:04:36.000
How are you coping?

1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:38.000
You know, it's been
quite difficult.

1:04:38.000 --> 1:04:40.000
I can imagine.
-Mmm.

1:04:40.000 --> 1:04:42.000
-You know, I'm locked up

1:04:42.000 --> 1:04:44.000
with only eagles and bears
and my family for company.

1:04:44.000 --> 1:04:46.000
Please don't kill yourself.

1:04:46.000 --> 1:04:48.000
What?

1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:50.000
I said it must be nice
to have time to yourself.

1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:53.000
Anyway, before we get on
to the exciting

1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:56.000
and your big decision
to come home to New York,

1:04:56.000 --> 1:04:59.000
the good news is that
we have found a buyer

1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:01.000
Uh, actually,
I haven't decided to

1:05:01.000 --> 1:05:04.000
The buyer saw the diamond
on the virtual presentation

1:05:04.000 --> 1:05:06.000
that you put together
ahead of the store takeover.

1:05:06.000 --> 1:05:08.000
That's great. Who is it?

1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:11.000
In our new world, Linda,

1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:13.000
one does not ask who.
He's anonymous.

1:05:13.000 --> 1:05:15.000
But I can tell you this.
He's, um...

1:05:15.000 --> 1:05:18.000
A very unpleasant member
of a very unpleasant family

1:05:18.000 --> 1:05:22.000
who run a very
unpleasant country

1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:23.000
Oh.

1:05:23.000 --> 1:05:25.000
He is facilitating Miracore
in his country

1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:28.000
and so I've brokered
the purchase of the diamond

1:05:28.000 --> 1:05:31.000
Harrods themselves
will have nothing

1:05:31.000 --> 1:05:34.000
so I have acted
as go-between.

1:05:35.000 --> 1:05:37.000
Hurray for us, no?

1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:39.000
Yes, hurray for us.

1:05:39.000 --> 1:05:42.000
Uh, will he be wanting
to pick up the diamond

1:05:42.000 --> 1:05:45.000
He is not allowed
into the UK.

1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:48.000
Money laundering?
Human rights abuses?

1:05:48.000 --> 1:05:51.000
Anyway,
the big question, Linda,

1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:54.000
the issue at hand here
is the future of Linda.

1:05:54.000 --> 1:05:56.000
When will you
be coming home?

1:05:57.000 --> 1:05:58.000
Um...

1:05:58.000 --> 1:06:01.000
Well, I've decided
to leave my decision

1:06:01.000 --> 1:06:03.000
until after lockdown
is lifted.

1:06:03.000 --> 1:06:07.000
-Okay.
-I have lots of ties

1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:09.000
Uh-huh. I was told
that you're single.

1:06:13.000 --> 1:06:17.000
Actually,
that was never true,

1:06:17.000 --> 1:06:21.000
The fact that you are single
is one of the reasons I want

1:06:21.000 --> 1:06:23.000
I'm planning to get to know
more about you.

1:06:23.000 --> 1:06:24.000
You...

1:06:24.000 --> 1:06:26.000
You fascinate me, Linda.

1:06:26.000 --> 1:06:28.000
So tough on the outside,

1:06:28.000 --> 1:06:30.000
but inside,

1:06:31.000 --> 1:06:32.000
are you tough?

1:06:35.000 --> 1:06:37.000
Do you remember
when you came to Paris?

1:06:37.000 --> 1:06:39.000
That evening,
after the meeting,

1:06:39.000 --> 1:06:41.000
I was going to take you
out to dinner.

1:06:41.000 --> 1:06:45.000
I was actually going to try
to seduce you that night.

1:06:45.000 --> 1:06:50.000
Well, I can only speculate
what kind of evening

1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:54.000
But I suspect it would have
involved broken glass.

1:06:54.000 --> 1:06:56.000
Anyway, uh, should I
send the diamond

1:06:56.000 --> 1:06:58.000
to this probable
mass murderer's home

1:06:58.000 --> 1:07:01.000
or should I send it straight
to his torture chamber?

1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.000
What?

1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:04.000
Where would you like me
to send the diamond?

1:07:05.000 --> 1:07:07.000
Ah, send it to New York.

1:07:08.000 --> 1:07:10.000
Um, because of COVID,
it will be

1:07:10.000 --> 1:07:13.000
to a safe vault
in Wall Street.

1:07:13.000 --> 1:07:15.000
There'll be no one
to check it there,

1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:19.000
so please make sure
that the verification papers

1:07:20.000 --> 1:07:22.000
Got that?

1:07:22.000 --> 1:07:24.000
-Um--
-For many of our

1:07:25.000 --> 1:07:28.000
the act of acquisition
is an end in itself.

1:07:28.000 --> 1:07:30.000
Okay. See you
in New York, Linda.

1:07:30.000 --> 1:07:31.000
Well, I...

1:07:42.000 --> 1:07:43.000
To mention

1:07:43.000 --> 1:07:45.000
On looking flash

1:07:45.000 --> 1:07:47.000
your attention

1:07:47.000 --> 1:07:50.000
And your record collection

1:07:50.000 --> 1:07:52.000
You'll qualify

1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:54.000
Old age pension

1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:59.000
Your money or your life

1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:06.000
No bullet or a knife

1:08:15.000 --> 1:08:17.000
Don't be ridiculous, Linda.

1:08:18.000 --> 1:08:20.000
A shortage of medical masks,

1:08:20.000 --> 1:08:22.000
people are making their own
from old clothing.

1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:24.000
But the WHO said
it doesn't know

1:08:24.000 --> 1:08:26.000
Hey.

1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:27.000
-Where'd you go?
-

1:08:27.000 --> 1:08:28.000
Peckham Rye.

1:08:28.000 --> 1:08:31.000
-Why?
-I don't know.

1:08:31.000 --> 1:08:32.000
What do you mean,
you don't know?

1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:34.000
I was just driving
really, really fast,

1:08:34.000 --> 1:08:36.000
because I was being chased
by the police.

1:08:36.000 --> 1:08:38.000
-What?
-I was playing

1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:41.000
Green for stop,
red for go.

1:08:41.000 --> 1:08:42.000
Fuck!

1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:43.000
Did they get
your license number?

1:08:44.000 --> 1:08:45.000
No, I'm too fast for 'em.

1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:47.000
I'm a streak of light
on an empty road

1:08:48.000 --> 1:08:49.000
I'm the last man alive.

1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:52.000
I let the road direct me
and I achieved that

1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:55.000
where the bike becomes
part of your body.

1:08:55.000 --> 1:08:58.000
I found myself in South London
on some sort of urban farm

1:08:58.000 --> 1:09:00.000
and I hid among the goats.

1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:02.000
Remember the goat
was my totem animal

1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:07.000
I sat with the goats
and then resumed my journey

1:09:07.000 --> 1:09:09.000
I was in Peckham.

1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:10.000
I bought you cigarettes.

1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:12.000
And I had one myself.

1:09:12.000 --> 1:09:14.000
My first real, real one
in ten years.

1:09:15.000 --> 1:09:18.000
And you were right,
tobacco tastes like youth!

1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:20.000
And real is real,
and real tobacco

1:09:20.000 --> 1:09:22.000
and I want another one
right now

1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:23.000
and I'm gonna have one.

1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:40.000
You have a look in your eyes
I haven't seen in a long time.

1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:42.000
I don't mean
to frighten you.

1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:44.000
I'm not frightened.

1:09:45.000 --> 1:09:49.000
Remember I told you
about the glass horse

1:09:49.000 --> 1:09:53.000
No, I'm still
with the goats.

1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:55.000
I held the horse and jockey
by the jockey

1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:58.000
and swung it around and...

1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:00.000
And I remembered how it felt
to be a rider

1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:03.000
and to feel like
you're a part of the thing

1:10:03.000 --> 1:10:05.000
It's a sexual feeling.

1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:07.000
Yeah, it is.

1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:10.000
I now wish
I'd come with you.

1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:12.000
Really?

1:10:13.000 --> 1:10:15.000
Paxton,

1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:18.000
for a long time,
I've known that

1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:22.000
And for a long time,
the only unbroken thread

1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:24.000
Go on.

1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:27.000
I'm finding this moment
difficult because...

1:10:27.000 --> 1:10:29.000
I made a vow
this wouldn't happen,

1:10:29.000 --> 1:10:32.000
so could you just
take the leather jacket off

1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:33.000
and go hold a tea towel
or something?

1:10:34.000 --> 1:10:36.000
-Hold a tea towel?
-Or buy some milk,

1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:39.000
-We have milk.
-Or bake bread. That would

1:10:39.000 --> 1:10:41.000
I just want to get
on my bike and ride

1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:42.000
and fuck the world.

1:10:46.000 --> 1:10:48.000
Okay, Paxton,
here it is.

1:10:50.000 --> 1:10:52.000
Probably as a result
of lockdown,

1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:54.000
you have a mad urge
to ride your motorbike

1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.000
And as of two hours ago,
I have a mad urge

1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.000
to steal a diamond
worth three million pounds

1:10:58.000 --> 1:10:59.000
from a mass murderer

1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:00.000
and quit my job
and become an artist.

1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:02.000
What?

1:11:02.000 --> 1:11:03.000
But I think
the most practical thing

1:11:03.000 --> 1:11:05.000
we can do to get this
madness out of our system

1:11:05.000 --> 1:11:08.000
is that I break my vow
and we go upstairs

1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:09.000
and have sex.

1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:11.000
"Lockdown-one-last-ride."

1:11:13.000 --> 1:11:15.000
Goats, now this.

1:11:15.000 --> 1:11:17.000
What a fucking day.

1:11:26.000 --> 1:11:29.000
Hi. Yeah, she's, uh,
she's just changing.

1:11:30.000 --> 1:11:32.000
Oh, by the way,

1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:34.000
you ever heard of a poet
called Edgar Allan Poe?

1:11:34.000 --> 1:11:36.000
-What?
-Yeah, never mind.

1:11:36.000 --> 1:11:38.000
All right. One second.

1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:39.000
You're listening to

1:11:39.000 --> 1:11:42.000
And this is
George Frideric Handel.

1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:59.000
Please hang up or press

1:11:59.000 --> 1:12:02.000
Uh, Linda, I'm just calling
to say that

1:12:02.000 --> 1:12:04.000
I know this afternoon
didn't mean anything,

1:12:04.000 --> 1:12:08.000
but I want you to know
that it would have

1:12:09.000 --> 1:12:11.000
like South Dakota

1:12:11.000 --> 1:12:13.000
that afternoon
when it rained.

1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:15.000
And also, I have
this bizarre memory

1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:18.000
that just before we strayed
from the path

1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:20.000
you said something
about stealing a diamond.

1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:22.000
...you said something

1:12:23.000 --> 1:12:24.000
Did I imagine that?

1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.000
Oh, God!
-

1:12:27.000 --> 1:12:28.000
Thank you.

1:12:32.000 --> 1:12:36.000
No, Grandma, I am not
seriously considering it.

1:12:46.000 --> 1:12:47.000
Fuck.

1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:03.000
This is where the patients

1:13:03.000 --> 1:13:07.000
But now, it's needed for
COVID-19 overflow from

1:13:07.000 --> 1:13:11.000
Hospitals are having
to adapt their spaces

1:13:11.000 --> 1:13:13.000
to be able to deal
with Coronavirus.

1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:15.000
I've been a nurse in ICU

1:13:16.000 --> 1:13:17.000
-and I've never seen...
-

1:13:25.000 --> 1:13:27.000
All right.

1:13:27.000 --> 1:13:30.000
Big Saturday. Harrods.

1:13:32.000 --> 1:13:34.000
The grand deception.

1:13:35.000 --> 1:13:37.000
You have to tell me
exactly what it is

1:13:38.000 --> 1:13:39.000
Paxton...

1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:43.000
Sit down. Wait there.

1:13:48.000 --> 1:13:51.000
This is just us organizing
what it is that

1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:52.000
It's nothing else.

1:13:53.000 --> 1:13:54.000
Why, what else
would it be?

1:13:54.000 --> 1:13:55.000
Nothing. Why do you ask?

1:13:57.000 --> 1:13:58.000
Are you okay?

1:13:58.000 --> 1:14:02.000
Me? I am okay.
I am intensely okay

1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:04.000
Okay. Background.

1:14:04.000 --> 1:14:10.000
Harrods. The top part
is the public area.

1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:13.000
But below ground,
there are seven floors.

1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:15.000
Floors where merchandise
is stored

1:14:15.000 --> 1:14:16.000
and lots of tunnels

1:14:17.000 --> 1:14:19.000
where expensive items
such as jewelry

1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:21.000
are transported
to secure elevators.

1:14:21.000 --> 1:14:22.000
All grown up
and glamorous above

1:14:22.000 --> 1:14:25.000
and efficient
and scary below.

1:14:25.000 --> 1:14:27.000
Security at Harrods
is unbelievably tight,

1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:28.000
it would be impossible
to get inside

1:14:28.000 --> 1:14:30.000
to actually
steal something.

1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:31.000
Steal?

1:14:31.000 --> 1:14:34.000
Who's talking about
stealing anything?

1:14:34.000 --> 1:14:36.000
Everything is normal.
Paxton, stop being weird.

1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:39.000
It's not me being weird.

1:14:39.000 --> 1:14:41.000
I mean, you clearly appear
to have a hidden agenda,

1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:43.000
which is
not really that hidden,

1:14:43.000 --> 1:14:46.000
Also, you've got
a smudge above your eye.

1:14:46.000 --> 1:14:49.000
Did you get my message
on your phone last night?

1:14:49.000 --> 1:14:51.000
About South Dakota?

1:14:52.000 --> 1:14:53.000
And about a diamond.

1:14:53.000 --> 1:14:56.000
Paxton, what is
the matter with you?

1:14:56.000 --> 1:14:58.000
-There's nothing
the matter with me.

1:14:58.000 --> 1:15:02.000
Yesterday, you were talking
about stealing a diamond.

1:15:02.000 --> 1:15:04.000
You were,
I'm not imagining it.

1:15:04.000 --> 1:15:07.000
And today, you are drawing
Harrods like it's, uh,

1:15:07.000 --> 1:15:10.000
some kind of secret plan
in a secret heist movie.

1:15:10.000 --> 1:15:14.000
How can you draw
a rectangle like you're in

1:15:14.000 --> 1:15:16.000
Do you have
a secret plan?

1:15:19.000 --> 1:15:21.000
I saw my grandmother's
face yesterday.

1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:24.000
I told her,
"It's okay, Grandma,

1:15:24.000 --> 1:15:26.000
I'm not going to do
anything stupid."

1:15:26.000 --> 1:15:28.000
You said the diamond
is called a Harris Diamond.

1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:31.000
Oh, Paxton, come on.

1:15:31.000 --> 1:15:33.000
It's Saturday.
It's morning.

1:15:33.000 --> 1:15:38.000
All the weird 4:00 a.m.
fantasies and options have

1:15:38.000 --> 1:15:40.000
Tell me about
the diamond.

1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:45.000
There are
two Harris Diamonds.

1:15:45.000 --> 1:15:49.000
-What?
-There are two

1:15:49.000 --> 1:15:51.000
-Why are there two?
-

1:15:51.000 --> 1:15:54.000
Do you think I slept at all
last night, Paxton?

1:15:54.000 --> 1:15:56.000
Well actually, no,
I didn't.

1:15:56.000 --> 1:15:58.000
And what was it
that kept you awake?

1:16:00.000 --> 1:16:03.000
Harris Diamond one,
Harris Diamond two.

1:16:03.000 --> 1:16:08.000
One is real,
the other is fake.

1:16:09.000 --> 1:16:11.000
Whenever a diamond
of this value

1:16:11.000 --> 1:16:12.000
they use a replica
of the real thing

1:16:12.000 --> 1:16:13.000
to put
into the public area.

1:16:14.000 --> 1:16:16.000
The actual diamond
is kept safe

1:16:16.000 --> 1:16:19.000
Currently, the replica

1:16:19.000 --> 1:16:21.000
is on display here
on the ground floor.

1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:27.000
But your real
Harris Diamond

1:16:27.000 --> 1:16:29.000
Tonight,
at exactly 7:00 p.m.,

1:16:29.000 --> 1:16:30.000
you and I will be escorted
to the vaults by security

1:16:30.000 --> 1:16:32.000
to collect
the real Harris Diamond.

1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:34.000
We will then go
up the ground floor

1:16:34.000 --> 1:16:37.000
in a secure elevator
where we add the diamond

1:16:37.000 --> 1:16:38.000
to the rest
of the Eve Schwarz

1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:41.000
Then, right there at 7:30 p.m.,
we will have the real diamond

1:16:41.000 --> 1:16:43.000
and the very good
replica diamond,

1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:45.000
next to each other,
almost indistinguishable.

1:16:45.000 --> 1:16:47.000
And because
of COVID restrictions,

1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:51.000
the only people
that will be there

1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:55.000
So, then we put
the real diamond

1:16:55.000 --> 1:16:56.000
and send it to New York,
and we take

1:16:56.000 --> 1:16:58.000
and I put it in my purse,
we take it away

1:16:58.000 --> 1:17:00.000
and that is what we are going
to fucking do,

1:17:00.000 --> 1:17:03.000
exactly that
and nothing else.

1:17:05.000 --> 1:17:07.000
May I ask
a very obvious question?

1:17:07.000 --> 1:17:09.000
No, you may not.

1:17:09.000 --> 1:17:11.000
What would happen if we sent
the replica to New York

1:17:12.000 --> 1:17:13.000
and kept the real thing?

1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:15.000
I'm assuming that as soon
as it got to New York,

1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:18.000
someone would realize
that it was fake.

1:17:18.000 --> 1:17:20.000
No, they wouldn't.

1:17:20.000 --> 1:17:23.000
That is why
I couldn't sleep.

1:17:23.000 --> 1:17:25.000
Whichever one we send
to New York,

1:17:25.000 --> 1:17:27.000
it will go
into a secure vault

1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:29.000
and won't even be looked at
by another human being

1:17:29.000 --> 1:17:32.000
for 20, 50, 100 years.

1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:33.000
Holy fuck.

1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:39.000
Three million pounds,
tax free.

1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:41.000
No consequences.

1:17:41.000 --> 1:17:42.000
One for me, one for you,
one for the NHS.

1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:43.000
You have thought
about this.

1:17:43.000 --> 1:17:46.000
You know,
I need to go meditate.

1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:48.000
Are you sure they
won't check it in New York?

1:17:48.000 --> 1:17:50.000
Shut up.
I need to meditate.

1:17:50.000 --> 1:17:51.000
What were you going to say?

1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:54.000
The man who bought
the diamond is bad.

1:17:54.000 --> 1:17:56.000
He's really bad,
and you and I are good.

1:17:56.000 --> 1:17:58.000
And the NHS is good.
And good is better

1:17:59.000 --> 1:18:00.000
When I explained
all that to Grandma,

1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:01.000
even she said,
"Well, yeah, that's true."

1:18:01.000 --> 1:18:04.000
And she was a Calvinist,
straight as a rod.

1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:07.000
Unlike me, who is weak
in the face of temptation.

1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:12.000
Live wild or die, Linda.

1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:15.000
Paxton,
you're forgetting something

1:18:15.000 --> 1:18:17.000
Assuming that
we do this thing,

1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:19.000
which we definitely won't,

1:18:20.000 --> 1:18:22.000
how would two ordinary people
like you and me

1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:26.000
find a way to sell
a three million pounds

1:18:26.000 --> 1:18:28.000
Okay, that was it.
That was my last attempt

1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:29.000
to find a logical reason
why we shouldn't do this,

1:18:30.000 --> 1:18:32.000
but you are going to say
"Archie Bruce," aren't you?

1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:33.000
Yes, I am.

1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:35.000
Archie Bruce.

1:18:37.000 --> 1:18:40.000
Over the years,
I've kept up

1:18:40.000 --> 1:18:41.000
I mean, Archie Bruce,

1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:43.000
he's graduated
from stealing motorcycles

1:18:43.000 --> 1:18:45.000
to stealing vintage cars

1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:47.000
and fine art and jewelry.

1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:51.000
I mean, he'd have Mr. Harris
in a penthouse in Moscow

1:18:51.000 --> 1:18:52.000
before the banging
of the next saucepans.

1:18:53.000 --> 1:18:54.000
And he'd do
a preferential deal

1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:56.000
because you stepped in
one night and saved his life

1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:59.000
at a roadhouse in Watford.

1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:01.000
Circle of life,
something like that.

1:19:03.000 --> 1:19:06.000
With Archie Bruce,
the nightmare began.

1:19:06.000 --> 1:19:08.000
Maybe with Archie Bruce,
the nightmare ends.

1:19:10.000 --> 1:19:15.000
So, what are we
going to do, Linda?

1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:21.000
Okay, Paxton, here it is.

1:19:23.000 --> 1:19:26.000
We decide tonight.

1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:28.000
When we're there at Harrods
with the diamonds,

1:19:28.000 --> 1:19:30.000
we're gonna know what's right
and what's wrong.

1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:32.000
We'll decide in the moment.

1:19:32.000 --> 1:19:33.000
Or let the moment decide.

1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:37.000
What's the difference?

1:19:37.000 --> 1:19:39.000
Fate versus free will.

1:19:39.000 --> 1:19:41.000
Who controls our destiny?

1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:42.000
Is everything
part of a plan

1:19:42.000 --> 1:19:44.000
or do we fuck things up
for ourselves?

1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:48.000
Tonight at 7:30,
we find out.

1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:58.000
Hey, half-brother.

1:20:00.000 --> 1:20:02.000
What, now?
You wanna Zoom?

1:20:03.000 --> 1:20:05.000
All right,
give me a minute.

1:20:12.000 --> 1:20:16.000
Ah, Paxton,
how are you?

1:20:16.000 --> 1:20:19.000
Actually, I am at a fork
in the road.

1:20:19.000 --> 1:20:21.000
Really? Then perhaps
what I have to say

1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:23.000
will have some bearing
on which fork you take,

1:20:23.000 --> 1:20:24.000
because it is
sort of road related.

1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:28.000
You see, Paxton,
the other day

1:20:28.000 --> 1:20:30.000
you want
to sell your motorcycle,

1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:35.000
I thought, "Wait a minute.
Time out. Not so fast."

1:20:35.000 --> 1:20:40.000
And then,
after I cut the call

1:20:40.000 --> 1:20:41.000
Mum?

1:20:41.000 --> 1:20:43.000
How she would feel
about you having to sell

1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:44.000
your most
precious possession,

1:20:44.000 --> 1:20:46.000
while at the same time,
over here

1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:47.000
in the beautiful
Hudson Valley,

1:20:48.000 --> 1:20:50.000
your brother,
your half-brother

1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:54.000
You know,
when the cherry trees

1:20:55.000 --> 1:20:57.000
it sucks,
but there are worse things.

1:20:59.000 --> 1:21:01.000
Yeah, not for the cherry tree.

1:21:01.000 --> 1:21:02.000
Maybe worse for a cherry tree

1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:04.000
is the steady tread
of George Washington

1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:05.000
as he approaches
with an axe in his hand

1:21:05.000 --> 1:21:07.000
and a head
full of good intentions.

1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:10.000
Anyway, I wondered what Mom
would want me to do.

1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:11.000
Well, remembering Mum,

1:21:11.000 --> 1:21:13.000
I think she'd want you
to get to the point.

1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:17.000
Okay, Paxton, here it is.

1:21:19.000 --> 1:21:22.000
It is I who has bought
your precious motorcycle.

1:21:22.000 --> 1:21:25.000
The purchaser
of your bike is me.

1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:27.000
And I am
giving it back to you.

1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:30.000
My gesture,
half-brother to half-brother.

1:21:30.000 --> 1:21:33.000
Your bike is yours
once more.

1:21:33.000 --> 1:21:35.000
Don't thank me, Paxton.

1:21:35.000 --> 1:21:36.000
Please. No need.

1:21:36.000 --> 1:21:39.000
All I ask, the only thing
I ask of you, Paxton,

1:21:40.000 --> 1:21:43.000
is that
you are kind to yourself

1:21:43.000 --> 1:21:44.000
That you learn from this.

1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:46.000
That the world
does not hate you.

1:21:46.000 --> 1:21:49.000
That, yes, sometimes fate
seems harsh and cruel,

1:21:49.000 --> 1:21:51.000
but people really do
what good--

1:21:51.000 --> 1:21:55.000
Hey, David,
it's Linda. Hi!

1:21:55.000 --> 1:21:57.000
Uh, Linda, I thought
I was just speaking

1:21:57.000 --> 1:21:59.000
Yes, I know. I heard, David,
your magnificent gesture,

1:21:59.000 --> 1:22:01.000
and I just...
I couldn't stop myself,

1:22:01.000 --> 1:22:03.000
I couldn't help myself.
I just had to jump

1:22:03.000 --> 1:22:05.000
and say,
"Oh, my God, David.

1:22:05.000 --> 1:22:07.000
What kind
of a person are you?"

1:22:07.000 --> 1:22:08.000
David bought
my fucking bike.

1:22:08.000 --> 1:22:11.000
Yes, I heard. I heard,
and then I heard the sermon,

1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:12.000
and I thought, "Wow!

1:22:12.000 --> 1:22:15.000
Not only is he so generous
with his cash,

1:22:15.000 --> 1:22:17.000
he is so free
with his wisdom."

1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:20.000
Anyway, Paxton,
there it is--

1:22:20.000 --> 1:22:22.000
Don't let me interrupt
this meaningful moment.

1:22:22.000 --> 1:22:24.000
What is it that
you were saying, David?

1:22:24.000 --> 1:22:25.000
Something about fate
being harsh and...

1:22:25.000 --> 1:22:26.000
-...cruel?

1:22:30.000 --> 1:22:31.000
Hmm.

1:22:37.000 --> 1:22:38.000
Why were you mad at him?

1:22:38.000 --> 1:22:39.000
I wasn't mad.
-Yes, you were.

1:22:41.000 --> 1:22:42.000
It was you.

1:22:45.000 --> 1:22:48.000
Paxton, don't be ridiculous.
You heard what David said.

1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:51.000
David would never do
something like that,

1:22:51.000 --> 1:22:52.000
but he would
take the credit.

1:22:52.000 --> 1:22:54.000
Whereas you would do
something like that

1:22:54.000 --> 1:22:56.000
and give the credit
to someone else.

1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:58.000
You did it 'cause you
felt sorry for me.

1:23:00.000 --> 1:23:02.000
Yes, I worried
about what would happen

1:23:02.000 --> 1:23:04.000
if you lost everything.

1:23:04.000 --> 1:23:07.000
Mainly because
I didn't want anything bad

1:23:07.000 --> 1:23:09.000
Confession avalanche,
but also I...

1:23:09.000 --> 1:23:12.000
I did it because
the bike represents us.

1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:13.000
-And--
-No, no, no.

1:23:13.000 --> 1:23:18.000
Pity is over here, all right,
and love is way over here.

1:23:18.000 --> 1:23:19.000
Don't pretend
there is a bridge.

1:23:22.000 --> 1:23:24.000
But would you still
feel pity for a man

1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:25.000
who'd just stolen
a million pounds?

1:23:28.000 --> 1:23:29.000
I'd be a millionaire,

1:23:30.000 --> 1:23:32.000
and a  bandido  once again.

1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:35.000
Maybe you'd change
your mind.

1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:38.000
Maybe we'd ride off
into the sunset.

1:23:39.000 --> 1:23:41.000
Paxton...

1:23:41.000 --> 1:23:44.000
whatever we decide
to do tonight,

1:23:44.000 --> 1:23:45.000
we will go
our separate ways.

1:23:45.000 --> 1:23:48.000
The money would mean
that we're both free.

1:23:51.000 --> 1:23:52.000
Well, I will factor that

1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:54.000
into my decision-making
process.

1:23:57.000 --> 1:23:58.000
Thanks for the bike.

1:24:09.000 --> 1:24:10.000
Om...

1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:12.000
Ladies and gentlemen...

1:24:13.000 --> 1:24:15.000
fellow inmates...

1:24:16.000 --> 1:24:18.000
I have something for you

1:24:18.000 --> 1:24:20.000
before I head off
on the number 27 bus

1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:23.000
to meet my destiny.

1:24:23.000 --> 1:24:26.000
It's a passage
from a poem

1:24:26.000 --> 1:24:29.000
written by T.S. Eliot,

1:24:29.000 --> 1:24:31.000
who I'm sure no one
has ever heard of either.

1:24:33.000 --> 1:24:38.000
"She turns and looks a moment
in the glass,

1:24:38.000 --> 1:24:42.000
hardly aware
of her departed lover.

1:24:42.000 --> 1:24:46.000
Her brain allows one
half-formed thought

1:24:47.000 --> 1:24:51.000
Well, now that's done,
and I'm glad it's over."

1:24:56.000 --> 1:24:58.000
See you
in the moment, Linda.

1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:18.000
This could be
the last bus I ever take.

1:25:37.000 --> 1:25:39.000
Oh, I've decided
to go by myself. Thanks.

1:25:39.000 --> 1:25:41.000
No problem.
-Thank you.

1:26:19.000 --> 1:26:25.000
Do it, Paxton.
Take the opportunity

1:29:03.000 --> 1:29:05.000
-Hi, stranger.
- Oh, my God!

1:29:05.000 --> 1:29:06.000
-I want to hug you.

1:29:07.000 --> 1:29:08.000
I can't hug you,
I can't hug you.

1:29:08.000 --> 1:29:09.000
I hate this virus.

1:29:09.000 --> 1:29:11.000
I'm blowing you kisses.

1:29:11.000 --> 1:29:12.000
-Oh, my God.
- Hello, stranger.

1:29:12.000 --> 1:29:14.000
Hey, oh...
-

1:29:14.000 --> 1:29:16.000
This place died
when you left.

1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:18.000
Oh, Charlotte,
I need to know the name

1:29:18.000 --> 1:29:20.000
of your personal trainer
right now, seriously.

1:29:20.000 --> 1:29:22.000
I actually lost weight
because of stress,

1:29:22.000 --> 1:29:23.000
'cause I found out
my girlfriend

1:29:23.000 --> 1:29:24.000
was stealing a load of money
from me.

1:29:25.000 --> 1:29:27.000
What?
-Long story.

1:29:27.000 --> 1:29:28.000
-Hi!
-Hi.

1:29:28.000 --> 1:29:32.000
Terry, yeah.
Terry, guess who's here?

1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:34.000
Yeah, have a little look
at Cam 14.

1:29:39.000 --> 1:29:40.000
Oh, shit,
it's Linda.

1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:44.000
So, Linda,
what are you doing here?

1:29:44.000 --> 1:29:45.000
Oh, I'm not
on the list, because I made

1:29:46.000 --> 1:29:47.000
a special arrangement
with Imran,

1:29:47.000 --> 1:29:48.000
so I just need a desk
for five minutes.

1:29:48.000 --> 1:29:51.000
Or three minutes.
Charlotte, can I?

1:29:51.000 --> 1:29:53.000
-Come through.
- Okay. Oh!

1:29:53.000 --> 1:29:55.000
I need to wait
for my, um, driver.

1:29:55.000 --> 1:29:57.000
Oh, hang on.
Excuse me.

1:29:59.000 --> 1:30:01.000
Hi.
B2B Pro Freight Services?

1:30:01.000 --> 1:30:02.000
Yeah.

1:30:02.000 --> 1:30:03.000
For the Eve Schwarz
collection?

1:30:03.000 --> 1:30:05.000
-Uh-huh.
-Yeah?

1:30:05.000 --> 1:30:07.000
Okay, just wait here
for one second. Okay.

1:30:07.000 --> 1:30:11.000
We couldn't get
our normal freight service.

1:30:11.000 --> 1:30:13.000
World's gone mad.

1:30:13.000 --> 1:30:14.000
I'm going to have to run
a hundred checks

1:30:14.000 --> 1:30:15.000
We'll just need
to see his ID.

1:30:15.000 --> 1:30:17.000
And Imran said we do need
to check the driver's ID.

1:30:20.000 --> 1:30:21.000
Of course.

1:30:26.000 --> 1:30:27.000
Yeah,
can I see your ID?

1:30:34.000 --> 1:30:35.000
Thank you.

1:30:47.000 --> 1:30:49.000
Oh, my God, Charlotte.

1:30:49.000 --> 1:30:51.000
I didn't tell you.
You of all people.

1:30:51.000 --> 1:30:52.000
What?

1:30:52.000 --> 1:30:54.000
It's just
the most earth-shattering,

1:30:54.000 --> 1:30:55.000
life-changing,
amazing news.

1:30:55.000 --> 1:30:57.000
I found someone.
I met someone.

1:30:57.000 --> 1:30:59.000
-No.
-Yes.

1:30:59.000 --> 1:31:00.000
Oh, my God.
I thought you were

1:31:00.000 --> 1:31:02.000
-Me, too!
-Dating app? Bumble?

1:31:02.000 --> 1:31:04.000
-What's he like?
- He's, uh...

1:31:06.000 --> 1:31:08.000
He's a poet.

1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:09.000
-Oh?
-Yeah.

1:31:09.000 --> 1:31:11.000
Yeah, he's like
a really wild poet.

1:31:11.000 --> 1:31:12.000
Oh, my God,
that's so romantic.

1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:14.000
Hmm, I know.

1:31:14.000 --> 1:31:16.000
But listen, I've got a slot
in the vaults at 7:00.

1:31:16.000 --> 1:31:18.000
-I gotta get this guy
processed. Thank you.

1:31:18.000 --> 1:31:21.000
-Linda...
-Oh, life, life.

1:31:21.000 --> 1:31:22.000
Right? You never know
what's coming down the line.

1:31:22.000 --> 1:31:24.000
-Mmm-hmm.
-Okay.

1:31:27.000 --> 1:31:28.000
We're good.

1:31:31.000 --> 1:31:33.000
Thank you, Mark.

1:31:33.000 --> 1:31:35.000
Anything for you, Linda.

1:31:37.000 --> 1:31:40.000
Okay, I'm going
to generate you

1:31:40.000 --> 1:31:42.000
that will give you access
to all areas.

1:31:42.000 --> 1:31:46.000
-Date of birth.
- January 19th,

1:31:46.000 --> 1:31:49.000
But I didn't have
my first poem

1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:52.000
Okay, that's good.
That's good.

1:31:52.000 --> 1:31:54.000
You're taking it lightly.
You're not panicking.

1:31:54.000 --> 1:31:56.000
January 19th, 1980.

1:31:56.000 --> 1:31:58.000
Height, six feet.

1:31:58.000 --> 1:31:59.000
-Build--
-Medium athletic.

1:31:59.000 --> 1:32:01.000
And inside, I am panicking.

1:32:01.000 --> 1:32:04.000
You do realize
that we've both

1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:06.000
We haven't done
anything yet.

1:32:07.000 --> 1:32:10.000
Criminal convictions, none.

1:32:10.000 --> 1:32:12.000
So, when does
the moment begin?

1:32:12.000 --> 1:32:14.000
-The moment when we decide.

1:32:14.000 --> 1:32:17.000
In the CCTV control room,

1:32:17.000 --> 1:32:19.000
there's a deaf man
who reads lips.

1:32:19.000 --> 1:32:21.000
Shut up. Look here.

1:32:22.000 --> 1:32:24.000
Why are you good at this?

1:32:32.000 --> 1:32:34.000
Oh, Linda.

1:32:34.000 --> 1:32:35.000
I just need to get
the gentleman's name

1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:37.000
in case of a fire, so...

1:32:39.000 --> 1:32:41.000
-His name?
- Mmm-hmm.

1:32:41.000 --> 1:32:42.000
Edgar Allen Poe.

1:32:45.000 --> 1:32:47.000
Uh, Edgar...

1:32:48.000 --> 1:32:50.000
Edgar Allen Poe.

1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:52.000
Great, thanks.

1:32:54.000 --> 1:32:56.000
This is the first time
Harrods has been closed

1:32:56.000 --> 1:32:59.000
in a hundred years.

1:32:59.000 --> 1:33:02.000
Everything
has to get packed up

1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:05.000
Pearls, purses,
fine art, fine jewelry.

1:33:05.000 --> 1:33:06.000
Diamonds.

1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:07.000
Yeah. Diamonds.

1:33:13.000 --> 1:33:14.000
Remember that game
we used to play

1:33:14.000 --> 1:33:16.000
when we are alone
in an elevator,

1:33:16.000 --> 1:33:18.000
we ask
each other questions,

1:33:18.000 --> 1:33:19.000
and we are only allowed
to tell the absolute truth?

1:33:21.000 --> 1:33:22.000
Shoot.

1:33:22.000 --> 1:33:25.000
What went wrong
with you and me?

1:33:27.000 --> 1:33:30.000
When I met you,
I wanted wild

1:33:30.000 --> 1:33:34.000
And then,
I stopped wanting wild,

1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:38.000
-So, it should have worked.
-Yeah, but it didn't.

1:33:38.000 --> 1:33:39.000
-Why not?
-I don't know.

1:33:39.000 --> 1:33:43.000
That's the truth.

1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:45.000
-

1:33:47.000 --> 1:33:49.000
-Are you hungry?
-Yeah.

1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:14.000
We have an hour
until our slot

1:34:14.000 --> 1:34:17.000
so what do you want
to eat, Paxton?

1:34:17.000 --> 1:34:18.000
There is
literally everything.

1:34:22.000 --> 1:34:23.000
With the store closing,
Harrods is gonna give

1:34:24.000 --> 1:34:25.000
all of this food away
to a food bank.

1:34:30.000 --> 1:34:32.000
Fine.

1:34:33.000 --> 1:34:34.000
Is there anybody watching?

1:34:35.000 --> 1:34:36.000
Maybe.

1:34:37.000 --> 1:34:38.000
Dream bigger.

1:34:43.000 --> 1:34:44.000
Finest beluga caviar?

1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:58.000
So is this the moment?

1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:00.000
No.

1:35:00.000 --> 1:35:03.000
No. We gotta get
something clear

1:35:03.000 --> 1:35:05.000
This is a black
Perigord truffle

1:35:06.000 --> 1:35:08.000
It retails for £735.

1:35:08.000 --> 1:35:09.000
-For a fucking mushroom?
-Okay.

1:35:10.000 --> 1:35:11.000
Okay, that is what we need
to get clear in our minds.

1:35:11.000 --> 1:35:13.000
What is the difference
between the cost of things,

1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:15.000
and the value of things
to you and me?

1:35:15.000 --> 1:35:16.000
So, I'm gonna
make a picnic.

1:35:16.000 --> 1:35:17.000
A picnic which
under normal circumstances

1:35:17.000 --> 1:35:20.000
would cost us about £5,000.

1:35:49.000 --> 1:35:51.000
Door's closing.

1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:53.000
My precious grandma
was a racist.

1:35:53.000 --> 1:35:54.000
-Whoa.
-Yeah.

1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:56.000
And I've just decided
to take her off

1:35:56.000 --> 1:35:57.000
my in-head jury of people

1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:59.000
who pass judgment
on what I do.

1:36:01.000 --> 1:36:02.000
So, who else
is on the jury?

1:36:04.000 --> 1:36:05.000
My dead mother,
God and you.

1:36:06.000 --> 1:36:07.000
How come I'm still there?

1:36:08.000 --> 1:36:09.000
-

1:36:09.000 --> 1:36:12.000
Doors are open,
I don't have to tell you.

1:36:14.000 --> 1:36:16.000
I used to come in here
on my lunch break.

1:36:22.000 --> 1:36:25.000
So which one
of those paintings

1:36:25.000 --> 1:36:28.000
Uh,
I don't want to own one.

1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:31.000
You want to paint one.

1:36:31.000 --> 1:36:34.000
I just want to paint.

1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:38.000
So, this is the moment.

1:36:38.000 --> 1:36:39.000
Oh, wait.

1:36:39.000 --> 1:36:41.000
-Is the deaf guy looking?
-What?

1:36:41.000 --> 1:36:44.000
Oh, I made that guy up
so you would stop talking.

1:36:44.000 --> 1:36:46.000
Ah.

1:36:46.000 --> 1:36:47.000
Think about it.

1:36:47.000 --> 1:36:52.000
£100,000 a year for ten years.
£50,000 a year for 20 years.

1:36:52.000 --> 1:36:53.000
-A million pounds.
- Yeah.

1:36:54.000 --> 1:36:55.000
You could paint.

1:36:55.000 --> 1:36:56.000
You wouldn't even need
to sell anything.

1:36:57.000 --> 1:37:00.000
-

1:37:00.000 --> 1:37:02.000
I never learned
to ride a bicycle.

1:37:02.000 --> 1:37:03.000
-What?
-Yeah.

1:37:03.000 --> 1:37:04.000
-Never?
-Yeah.

1:37:05.000 --> 1:37:06.000
Went straight
to the motorcycle.

1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:10.000
Before Christmas,
I had a sexual encounter

1:37:10.000 --> 1:37:12.000
and it was great.

1:37:12.000 --> 1:37:14.000
-

1:37:17.000 --> 1:37:22.000
Okay, so we've established
that we both want freedom.

1:37:22.000 --> 1:37:25.000
-Maria, really?
-Oh, Paxton.

1:37:25.000 --> 1:37:27.000
Paxton, we are about to make
the most important decision

1:37:27.000 --> 1:37:29.000
of our lives.
Can you concentrate?

1:37:31.000 --> 1:37:33.000
Okay, in our
decision-making process,

1:37:33.000 --> 1:37:35.000
we haven't yet
discussed morality.

1:37:35.000 --> 1:37:37.000
Look at that. That is...

1:37:37.000 --> 1:37:40.000
That's a whole city
in lockdown.

1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:43.000
Hospitals can't cope.
A million pounds would help.

1:37:43.000 --> 1:37:45.000
We'd be doing good.
Plus, I worked it out.

1:37:46.000 --> 1:37:47.000
If it's in 50s,
it all fits in one suitcase.

1:37:47.000 --> 1:37:49.000
You can
leave it on a doorstep.

1:37:49.000 --> 1:37:52.000
-You got rid of Grandma.
-Yes, I did. Thank you.

1:37:52.000 --> 1:37:55.000
So, okay, we do it.

1:37:57.000 --> 1:37:58.000
Fuck it.

1:37:58.000 --> 1:38:00.000
We decide right now.

1:38:01.000 --> 1:38:02.000
Okay.

1:38:05.000 --> 1:38:07.000
Previously,
I would have kissed you.

1:38:10.000 --> 1:38:11.000
Let's just see
what happens.

1:38:31.000 --> 1:38:33.000
-Okay.
-Fuck.

1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:35.000
-Maria?
-Okay, it's time to go.

1:38:35.000 --> 1:38:37.000
-Really?
-We gotta go to the vaults.

1:38:39.000 --> 1:38:41.000
So, are we gonna
do it or not?

1:38:57.000 --> 1:38:59.000
-Are you okay?

1:38:59.000 --> 1:39:01.000
God, no.

1:39:01.000 --> 1:39:03.000
Is God really part
of your in-head jury?

1:39:03.000 --> 1:39:04.000
Uh-huh.

1:39:04.000 --> 1:39:06.000
And for the record,
God is absolutely fine

1:39:06.000 --> 1:39:08.000
with whatever it is
that we decide to do.

1:39:09.000 --> 1:39:10.000
That's good to know.

1:39:12.000 --> 1:39:14.000
Hi, there.
P.J., right?

1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:15.000
Lead the way.

1:39:18.000 --> 1:39:20.000
Why does the name
Edgar Allen Poe

1:39:24.000 --> 1:39:26.000
-

1:39:34.000 --> 1:39:36.000
Thank you.
-You're welcome.

1:40:02.000 --> 1:40:03.000
You're shipping
that thing to New York?

1:40:35.000 --> 1:40:37.000
It's an underwater theme.

1:40:37.000 --> 1:40:39.000
-My idea.
-It's nice.

1:40:39.000 --> 1:40:41.000
You're very good
at what you do.

1:40:43.000 --> 1:40:45.000
Okay, so we only need
to pack up

1:40:45.000 --> 1:40:46.000
the jewelry and accessories.

1:40:46.000 --> 1:40:48.000
The clothing
all goes downstairs,

1:40:48.000 --> 1:40:49.000
so it shouldn't
take too long.

1:40:49.000 --> 1:40:51.000
Yeah, not too long,
so, uh...

1:40:52.000 --> 1:40:53.000
Shall I take it out?

1:40:54.000 --> 1:40:56.000
Yes. Why not?

1:41:04.000 --> 1:41:05.000
Okay.

1:41:25.000 --> 1:41:27.000
Do it quickly,
the fish are piranhas.

1:41:27.000 --> 1:41:30.000
-What?
-It's meant to be symbolic.

1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:31.000
-Symbolic of--
-I don't remember, okay.

1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:33.000
Just do it faster.

1:41:33.000 --> 1:41:35.000
You'll be fine.

1:41:51.000 --> 1:41:52.000
So, this is the moment.

1:41:54.000 --> 1:41:57.000
Just seems so easy.

1:41:57.000 --> 1:41:59.000
It's never been
about can we do it, Paxton.

1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:01.000
It's about...
should we do it?

1:42:01.000 --> 1:42:03.000
And will we do it?
It's about you and me.

1:42:03.000 --> 1:42:05.000
And I'm not saying
that we are going to do it,

1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:10.000
but if we are,
then you would need to

1:42:12.000 --> 1:42:15.000
So, shall I take the step?

1:42:17.000 --> 1:42:18.000
Take the step.
Then, we decide.

1:42:23.000 --> 1:42:24.000
Linda...

1:42:24.000 --> 1:42:25.000
if we are deciding
in the moment,

1:42:25.000 --> 1:42:27.000
then I say we do it.

1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:29.000
If we are letting
the moment decide,

1:42:29.000 --> 1:42:33.000
then, in my opinion,
the moment is saying

1:42:33.000 --> 1:42:34.000
"Put the replica
in the fucking box

1:42:34.000 --> 1:42:36.000
and put the real thing
in your bag."

1:42:38.000 --> 1:42:43.000
Freedom, Linda,
in one beautiful moment.

1:43:16.000 --> 1:43:17.000
Okay.

1:43:18.000 --> 1:43:19.000
Okay.

1:43:22.000 --> 1:43:23.000
-It's under control.
-It's under control.

1:43:23.000 --> 1:43:25.000
-Under control.
- Yeah.

1:43:27.000 --> 1:43:30.000
I think we should start
with the handbags,

1:43:30.000 --> 1:43:33.000
we should get

1:43:33.000 --> 1:43:35.000
Linda!

1:43:35.000 --> 1:43:36.000
-Linda, it's me.
- Donald.

1:43:36.000 --> 1:43:39.000
I need to speak to you
urgently.

1:43:39.000 --> 1:43:42.000
Um, excuse me,
could you please

1:43:42.000 --> 1:43:44.000
or something for a moment?

1:43:44.000 --> 1:43:46.000
I have
some very important things

1:43:48.000 --> 1:43:50.000
Uh... Uh-huh.

1:43:53.000 --> 1:43:54.000
Uh...

1:43:54.000 --> 1:43:56.000
Donald...

1:43:56.000 --> 1:43:58.000
Well, goodness,
I thought that I fired you,

1:43:59.000 --> 1:44:00.000
but you're here.

1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:02.000
Linda, listen. Someone made
an anonymous call

1:44:02.000 --> 1:44:04.000
to Miracore head office.

1:44:04.000 --> 1:44:06.000
They said that the driver
from B2B

1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:08.000
who is carrying
the Eve Schwarz collection

1:44:08.000 --> 1:44:10.000
is using a false name.

1:44:10.000 --> 1:44:12.000
They said he's got
a criminal record.

1:44:13.000 --> 1:44:15.000
Grandma, hey.

1:44:15.000 --> 1:44:17.000
I came as soon as I could.
Thank God you're okay.

1:44:17.000 --> 1:44:19.000
-I'm okay.
-Well, the police

1:44:19.000 --> 1:44:22.000
-The police are coming and...
-They'll be here any minute.

1:44:22.000 --> 1:44:24.000
They'll be here any minute.
Okay, that's...

1:44:24.000 --> 1:44:25.000
Now we're against
the clock.

1:44:26.000 --> 1:44:28.000
Uh, if he's innocent
and who he says he is,

1:44:28.000 --> 1:44:29.000
-then everything will--
-Everything will be okay.

1:44:29.000 --> 1:44:32.000
And it will be okay, Donald,
because I know what to do.

1:44:32.000 --> 1:44:33.000
What do you mean?

1:44:33.000 --> 1:44:34.000
-What are you going to do?
-Paxton?

1:44:34.000 --> 1:44:35.000
Paxton?

1:44:37.000 --> 1:44:40.000
Donald. Paxton.

1:44:40.000 --> 1:44:41.000
Paxton. Donald.

1:44:41.000 --> 1:44:42.000
Who are you?

1:44:42.000 --> 1:44:44.000
I'm Edgar Allen Poe,
obviously.

1:44:44.000 --> 1:44:46.000
-She just called you Paxton.
-Yes, Donald, this is Paxton.

1:44:46.000 --> 1:44:49.000
And I'm a woman
called Linda Jarvis.

1:44:49.000 --> 1:44:53.000
I'm an ordinary woman
who, 60 seconds ago,

1:44:53.000 --> 1:44:55.000
made an extraordinary
decision.

1:44:55.000 --> 1:44:56.000
Linda,
what are you going

1:44:56.000 --> 1:44:58.000
What is it
to do with you?

1:44:58.000 --> 1:45:01.000
What it has to do
with him is that...

1:45:01.000 --> 1:45:04.000
he is my partner
and my lover

1:45:04.000 --> 1:45:06.000
and I think
I'm still in love with him.

1:45:06.000 --> 1:45:08.000
-Really?

1:45:08.000 --> 1:45:10.000
But most importantly,
he is also my accomplice.

1:45:10.000 --> 1:45:13.000
You see, Donald, just now...
just one minute ago,

1:45:13.000 --> 1:45:14.000
I decided... We decided

1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:17.000
to steal the Harris Diamond
worth three million pounds.

1:45:17.000 --> 1:45:19.000
Holy fuck.
Confession avalanche.

1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:20.000
No, it's okay,
and I know Donald

1:45:20.000 --> 1:45:21.000
and also we don't have
a choice,

1:45:21.000 --> 1:45:23.000
because Donald
called the police

1:45:23.000 --> 1:45:24.000
and they're about to arrive
at any second.

1:45:24.000 --> 1:45:26.000
Oh, fuck!
-Like I said,

1:45:26.000 --> 1:45:27.000
it's going to be okay,
because when

1:45:28.000 --> 1:45:29.000
we are not
going to be here,

1:45:29.000 --> 1:45:31.000
-You are?
-Yes, we are.

1:45:31.000 --> 1:45:32.000
And Donald
is going to tell them

1:45:32.000 --> 1:45:34.000
that he talked to Linda

1:45:34.000 --> 1:45:35.000
and she said
that everything's fine,

1:45:35.000 --> 1:45:36.000
it was all
a misunderstanding.

1:45:36.000 --> 1:45:39.000
And then, he is going
to give them this,

1:45:39.000 --> 1:45:41.000
your ID verification.

1:45:41.000 --> 1:45:43.000
And you're going to say
that you recognize

1:45:43.000 --> 1:45:45.000
from another assignment.

1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:46.000
And then, you're going
to tell them a story.

1:45:46.000 --> 1:45:48.000
You're going
to tell them a story

1:45:48.000 --> 1:45:50.000
about how this driver
has an enemy at work

1:45:50.000 --> 1:45:52.000
-I am?
-Yes, you are.

1:45:52.000 --> 1:45:54.000
And do you know why you're
going to do all this, Donald?

1:45:54.000 --> 1:45:57.000
-No. Why?
-Because we are good.

1:45:58.000 --> 1:46:00.000
Paxton, Donald,
we three are good.

1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:02.000
And the bastards
who told me to fire you

1:46:02.000 --> 1:46:03.000
and the bastard
who bought that diamond,

1:46:03.000 --> 1:46:05.000
they won't even realize
that it's gone.

1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:08.000
-Mention the NHS.
-Yeah. Yes, ooh!

1:46:10.000 --> 1:46:12.000
What do you say, Donald?

1:46:12.000 --> 1:46:14.000
Will you
lie for us, Donald?

1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:21.000
I see
all this anarchy

1:46:21.000 --> 1:46:23.000
Idiotic,
insane fucking lockdown

1:46:24.000 --> 1:46:25.000
which has liberated us all.

1:46:25.000 --> 1:46:27.000
Donald, we'll give you money.
I'll give you 200 grand.

1:46:27.000 --> 1:46:28.000
Fuck the money.
I don't do this for money,

1:46:28.000 --> 1:46:29.000
I do this for beauty.

1:46:29.000 --> 1:46:31.000
Linda, you are wonderful.

1:46:31.000 --> 1:46:35.000
Linda, and he is
your secret bandit lover,

1:46:35.000 --> 1:46:37.000
and you are going
to spit in the face

1:46:37.000 --> 1:46:39.000
of the global monolith.

1:46:39.000 --> 1:46:40.000
During lockdown
I've had time

1:46:40.000 --> 1:46:44.000
to think and walk in the park
near my mother's house,

1:46:44.000 --> 1:46:47.000
and God, apart from
the dog walkers

1:46:47.000 --> 1:46:50.000
breathing everywhere,
God, it is

1:46:50.000 --> 1:46:53.000
Even before
the fucking virus,

1:46:53.000 --> 1:46:55.000
we were all locked down
in our own routines,

1:46:55.000 --> 1:46:57.000
our versions
of ourselves...

1:46:57.000 --> 1:46:58.000
Linda, we have to get
the fuck out of here.

1:46:58.000 --> 1:46:59.000
Let Donald have his moment.

1:47:00.000 --> 1:47:01.000
...never get to work!

1:47:01.000 --> 1:47:02.000
I only came here tonight

1:47:02.000 --> 1:47:03.000
because I was worried
about you, Linda.

1:47:03.000 --> 1:47:05.000
I don't give a fuck
about Miracore,

1:47:05.000 --> 1:47:07.000
their fucking diamonds,
I don't care about them.

1:47:08.000 --> 1:47:10.000
I want everything
to be stolen.

1:47:11.000 --> 1:47:13.000
I will lie for you, Linda,

1:47:14.000 --> 1:47:19.000
because this is my moment
to fucking do something!

1:47:32.000 --> 1:47:33.000
Mad, all this, isn't it?

1:47:33.000 --> 1:47:35.000
-Yeah.
-

1:47:35.000 --> 1:47:37.000
Who'd have thought
a month ago

1:47:38.000 --> 1:47:39.000
Not me.

1:47:41.000 --> 1:47:43.000
Paging Edgar Allen Poe.

1:47:43.000 --> 1:47:47.000
Edgar Allen Poe,
please report to security.

1:48:01.000 --> 1:48:03.000
Mr. Edgar Allen Poe,

1:48:03.000 --> 1:48:06.000
please report
to security immediately.

1:48:06.000 --> 1:48:08.000
I think
we should speed up.

1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:10.000
Don't rush. We're not trying
to evacuate Dunkirk!

1:48:10.000 --> 1:48:11.000
Stop there. If you walk,

1:48:12.000 --> 1:48:14.000
you should be
on the starboard side.

1:48:16.000 --> 1:48:17.000
Leave it.
Leave it.

1:48:19.000 --> 1:48:20.000
Linda?

1:48:20.000 --> 1:48:23.000
-  Paging

1:48:23.000 --> 1:48:26.000
Mr. Edgar Allen Poe,
please report to security.

1:48:26.000 --> 1:48:29.000
It's Michael
with the arrows

1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:37.000
-  Mr. Edgar Allen Poe,

1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:40.000
please report
to security immediately.

1:48:42.000 --> 1:48:44.000
Oh, fuck.

1:48:44.000 --> 1:48:46.000
You'll have to turn in
your Harrods pass.

1:48:46.000 --> 1:48:47.000
You go. Save yourself.

1:48:47.000 --> 1:48:49.000
It's me that fate
is fucking with.

1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:51.000
Just keep walking.

1:48:52.000 --> 1:48:54.000
Edgar Allen Poe.

1:48:58.000 --> 1:49:00.000
You left this
in the office.

1:49:02.000 --> 1:49:03.000
You'll need it at Heathrow.

1:49:07.000 --> 1:49:10.000
Thanks very much.

1:49:10.000 --> 1:49:13.000
Everybody says, uh,
come back soon, Linda,

1:49:13.000 --> 1:49:14.000
and we all love you.

1:50:20.000 --> 1:50:22.000
Since that night,
we've established

1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:23.000
that although we're now
both rich

1:50:23.000 --> 1:50:25.000
and no longer have
to do jobs we despise,

1:50:25.000 --> 1:50:27.000
the strains of lockdown

1:50:27.000 --> 1:50:28.000
are still severely testing
our relationship.

1:50:28.000 --> 1:50:30.000
"Happy ever after"
cannot survive

1:50:30.000 --> 1:50:32.000
someone hiding
your bag of flour.

1:50:32.000 --> 1:50:34.000
Okay, come on. Okay.

1:50:35.000 --> 1:50:37.000
Here is your bag of flour.
I just...

1:50:37.000 --> 1:50:39.000
I want you to promise me that
you're not gonna make bread.

1:50:39.000 --> 1:50:41.000
Why not?

1:50:41.000 --> 1:50:43.000
Because of the mess
and the pointlessness

1:50:43.000 --> 1:50:45.000
and because
it will be inedible,

1:50:45.000 --> 1:50:47.000
it will be a fucking
pointless cannonball.

1:50:47.000 --> 1:50:49.000
My dad used to make it
and we had to eat it,

1:50:49.000 --> 1:50:50.000
otherwise he would disappear
into his workshop

1:50:50.000 --> 1:50:52.000
and make these
hopeless wooden toys.

1:50:53.000 --> 1:50:54.000
-Never again.
-Linda, you've lost

1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:55.000
What? I've lost--

1:50:55.000 --> 1:50:57.000
You buried a hedgehog

1:50:57.000 --> 1:50:59.000
and said a eulogy
over the fucking grave.

1:50:59.000 --> 1:51:01.000
And you deliberately
stuck a piece

1:51:01.000 --> 1:51:03.000
-above the stairs.
-No, it was there all along.

1:51:03.000 --> 1:51:05.000
-I almost
broke my fucking neck.

1:51:05.000 --> 1:51:06.000
I would have held
the stepladders.

1:51:07.000 --> 1:51:08.000
If it had been there
"all along,"

1:51:08.000 --> 1:51:09.000
I would have noticed it.

1:51:09.000 --> 1:51:10.000
But you haven't noticed
that there was no point

1:51:11.000 --> 1:51:12.000
in packing a suitcase

1:51:12.000 --> 1:51:15.000
because there is nowhere
you can actually go.

1:51:15.000 --> 1:51:17.000
They just extended lockdown
by another two weeks.

1:51:21.000 --> 1:51:23.000
Oh, shit.

1:51:25.000 --> 1:51:27.000
Well...

1:51:28.000 --> 1:51:30.000
All that
for a bag of flour

1:51:30.000 --> 1:51:32.000
and a definitely
pre-existing piece

1:51:32.000 --> 1:51:37.000
And because today
is my birthday.

1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:39.000
-It's okay.

1:51:39.000 --> 1:51:41.000
-I know.
- It's okay.

1:51:41.000 --> 1:51:43.000
-It's lockdown.
-No, I knew that.

1:51:43.000 --> 1:51:46.000
-Nobody knows what day it is,
never mind the date.

1:51:46.000 --> 1:51:48.000
I got you something
you really, really want.

1:51:56.000 --> 1:51:57.000
Go crazy.

1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:04.000
-Another two weeks?
-Another two weeks.

1:52:04.000 --> 1:52:06.000
Well, then,
my long suffering public

1:52:07.000 --> 1:52:09.000
may need another poem.

1:52:10.000 --> 1:52:11.000
Hmm.

1:52:11.000 --> 1:52:14.000
Counting The Beats
by Robert Graves.

1:52:15.000 --> 1:52:19.000
"You, love, and I,
you and I,

1:52:19.000 --> 1:52:21.000
and if no more
than only you and I,

1:52:21.000 --> 1:52:24.000
what care you and I?"

1:52:29.000 --> 1:52:35.000
"Counting the beats,
counting the slow heartbeats,

1:52:35.000 --> 1:52:40.000
the bleeding to death of time
in slow heartbeats,

1:52:40.000 --> 1:52:42.000
wakeful we lie.

1:52:42.000 --> 1:52:48.000
Cloudless day, night,
and another cloudless day,

1:52:48.000 --> 1:52:53.000
yet a huge cloud will burst
upon their heads one day."

1:52:53.000 --> 1:52:56.000
And on that day,
lockdown will end!

1:52:59.000 --> 1:53:02.000
"Only here,
as we are here, together,

1:53:02.000 --> 1:53:07.000
now and here,
always you and I."
