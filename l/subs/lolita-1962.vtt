03:21.017 --> 03:22.184
Quilty!

03:27.816 --> 03:29.274
Quilty!

03:33.196 --> 03:35.739
What, what?
Who's there?

03:35.907 --> 03:37.407
Are you Quilty?

03:39.035 --> 03:41.036
No, I'm Spartacus.

03:41.204 --> 03:43.288
Have you come to free the slaves
or something?

03:43.456 --> 03:44.915
Are you Quilty?

03:45.416 --> 03:47.417
Yeah. I'm Quilty, yeah, sure.

03:53.049 --> 03:54.424
Say, what you, uh...?

03:55.260 --> 03:58.637
What you putting your gloves on for?
Your hands cold or something?

03:58.805 --> 04:01.306
Shall we have a little chat
before we start?

04:01.599 --> 04:02.975
Before we start?

04:04.269 --> 04:05.727
Wow.

04:06.437 --> 04:07.604
Alrighty.

04:08.148 --> 04:09.356
Alrighty.

04:09.524 --> 04:11.984
No, no. Listen, listen, listen...

04:12.152 --> 04:15.279
...let's have a game, a little lovely game
of Roman Ping-Pong...

04:15.446 --> 04:18.490
...like two civilized senators.

04:20.285 --> 04:21.535
Roman ping....

04:25.373 --> 04:27.332
You're supposed to say, "Roman pong."

04:29.002 --> 04:31.128
Okay, you serve. I don't mind.

04:31.421 --> 04:32.880
I just don't mind.

04:33.548 --> 04:34.631
Come on.

04:39.762 --> 04:41.430
Ah....

04:43.308 --> 04:45.392
Bet you didn't know I had that.

04:47.228 --> 04:48.437
Roman Ping-Pong.

04:52.525 --> 04:54.943
Kind of tricky serve to handle,
eh, captain?

04:55.111 --> 04:57.529
Kind of tricky.
One of the champs taught me that.

05:01.159 --> 05:03.076
My motto is "be prepared."

05:07.040 --> 05:09.249
Say, you Jack Brewster? Are you?

05:10.418 --> 05:11.752
You know who I am.

05:12.629 --> 05:15.214
What's that? That's 3, 3-love.

05:15.381 --> 05:18.300
Gee, I'm really winning.
You want to get a rally going there.

05:19.469 --> 05:23.347
You know, I'm not accusing you, captain,
but it's sort of absurd...

05:23.514 --> 05:27.017
...the way people invade this house,
without even knocking.

05:27.227 --> 05:28.477
Four-1.

05:29.896 --> 05:33.440
Change service. I'll take the service again,
if you don't mind.

05:33.608 --> 05:37.027
I sort of like to have it up this end,
you know.

05:38.154 --> 05:39.947
They use the telephone.

05:42.408 --> 05:43.617
Jeez.

05:44.035 --> 05:45.786
What's that? That must be....

05:45.954 --> 05:48.830
Gee, I'm really winning here.
I'm really winning.

05:48.998 --> 05:51.333
I hope I don't get overcome with power.

05:51.501 --> 05:53.961
That's about, uh, 6-1 maybe.

05:54.170 --> 05:57.172
Let's say 6-1.
No, 6-2, I'll give you another point.

05:57.340 --> 05:59.091
Six-2, but I'm still winning.

05:59.425 --> 06:02.010
You really don't remember me, do you?

06:03.054 --> 06:06.890
Have you ever noticed how the champs,
different champs, use their bats?

06:07.058 --> 06:09.810
You know, some of them hold them
like this, and everything.

06:10.353 --> 06:12.437
Do you recall a girl...

06:13.856 --> 06:15.816
...called Dolores Haze?

06:18.027 --> 06:19.569
I remember one guy didn't have a hand.

06:19.737 --> 06:21.822
He had a bat instead of a hand.
He was a real wacky--

06:23.199 --> 06:24.408
Lolita!

06:27.453 --> 06:29.871
Lolita, heh.

06:30.039 --> 06:33.875
Yeah, yeah, I remember
that name all right.

06:34.043 --> 06:36.837
Maybe she made some telephone calls,
who cares?

06:37.880 --> 06:39.047
Gee.

06:43.761 --> 06:46.930
Hey, you're a sort of bad loser, captain.

06:48.141 --> 06:52.144
I never found a guy who'd sort of
pull a gun on me when he lost a game.

06:53.521 --> 06:55.022
Didn't anyone ever tell you...

06:55.189 --> 06:58.775
...it's not really who wins,
it's how you play, like the champs.

07:03.239 --> 07:06.867
Listen, I don't think I want
to play anymore. I wanna get a drink.

07:08.619 --> 07:10.746
Gee, I'm just dying for a drink.

07:11.497 --> 07:13.623
I'm just dying to have a drinkie.

07:16.210 --> 07:18.170
You're dying anyway, Quilty.

07:19.422 --> 07:20.630
Jeez.

07:21.257 --> 07:25.552
All my friends always
put their smokies out in the drink.

07:26.346 --> 07:27.346
It's so unsanitary.

07:27.513 --> 07:29.431
Quilty, I want you to concentrate.

07:30.308 --> 07:31.767
You're going to die.

07:32.268 --> 07:34.853
Try to understand
what is happening to you.

07:36.356 --> 07:39.524
You are either Australian...

07:39.692 --> 07:41.401
...or a German refugee.

07:42.528 --> 07:44.738
This is a gentile's house.

07:45.323 --> 07:47.074
You'd better run along.

07:47.408 --> 07:52.120
Think of what you did, Quilty,
and think of what is happening to you now.

07:53.623 --> 07:55.123
Say, that's a....

07:55.291 --> 07:57.876
That's a darling little gun you got there.

07:58.044 --> 07:59.753
That's a darling little thing.

07:59.921 --> 08:04.591
How much a guy like you want
for a darling little gun like that?

08:04.759 --> 08:05.884
Read this.

08:06.177 --> 08:08.095
What's this, the deed to the ranch?

08:08.262 --> 08:09.971
It's your death sentence.

08:10.556 --> 08:11.598
Read it.

08:12.350 --> 08:13.934
I can't read, mister.

08:14.102 --> 08:16.770
I never did none of that there
book learning, you know.

08:16.938 --> 08:18.271
Read it, Quilty.

08:25.321 --> 08:28.448
Because you took advantage of a sinner

08:29.158 --> 08:31.201
Because you took advantage

08:31.953 --> 08:33.537
Because you took

08:33.955 --> 08:37.332
Because you took advantage
Of my disadvantage

08:37.792 --> 08:42.421
Say, that's a dag-blasted
darn good poem you done there.

08:43.798 --> 08:45.340
When I stood Adam-naked--

08:45.508 --> 08:47.384
Oh, Adam-naked!

08:47.552 --> 08:50.137
You should be ashamed of yourself,
captain.

08:50.638 --> 08:54.015
Before a federal law
And all its stinging stars

08:54.434 --> 08:56.268
Tarnation! You old horn toad.

08:56.436 --> 08:59.688
That's mighty pretty.
That's a pretty poem.

09:00.356 --> 09:02.566
Because you took advantage

09:02.859 --> 09:04.776
It's getting a bit repetitious, isn't it?

09:04.944 --> 09:08.488
Because-- Here's another one.
Because you cheated me

09:09.282 --> 09:11.616
Because you took her at an age

09:12.410 --> 09:14.744
- When young lads--
- That's enough.

09:14.912 --> 09:19.374
Say, what you took it away for, mister?
That was getting kind of smutty there. Heh.

09:19.542 --> 09:22.461
Do you have any last words
before you die, Quilty?

09:25.131 --> 09:26.423
Listen, Mac...

09:27.216 --> 09:28.800
...you're drunk...

09:29.218 --> 09:30.760
...and I'm a sick man.

09:31.304 --> 09:35.265
This pistol-packing farce is becoming
a sort of nuisance.

09:36.809 --> 09:41.980
Why don't you and I sort of settle this
like two civilized people...

09:42.607 --> 09:46.735
...getting together and settling something?
Instead of.... All right, put them up.

09:46.903 --> 09:49.404
Do you want to die standing up
or sitting down?

09:49.614 --> 09:51.281
I want to die like a champion.

09:54.785 --> 09:56.036
Gee.

09:57.580 --> 09:58.914
Right in the boxing glove.

09:59.081 --> 10:01.708
You ought to be more careful
with that thing.

10:02.460 --> 10:07.589
Listen, captain, why don't you stop
trifling with life and death?

10:08.508 --> 10:12.260
I'm a playwright, you know.
I know all about this sort of tragedy...

10:12.428 --> 10:15.222
...and comedy and fantasy
and everything.

10:15.973 --> 10:19.142
I've got 52 successful scenarios
to my credit...

10:19.310 --> 10:23.104
...added to which, my father's a policeman.
You look like a music lover to me.

10:23.314 --> 10:24.898
Why don't you let....

10:26.067 --> 10:28.568
Why don't you let me play you
a little thing...

10:28.736 --> 10:30.028
...I wrote last week.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.282
Nice sort of opening, that.

10:34.450 --> 10:37.911
We could dream up some lyrics maybe.
You and I dream them up together...

10:38.079 --> 10:40.121
...you know, share the profits.

10:42.875 --> 10:45.377
Do you think that'll make the hit parade?

10:48.130 --> 10:52.342
"The moon was blue, and so are you,
and I tonight...

10:52.677 --> 10:54.386
...she's mine-- Yours.

10:54.845 --> 10:56.680
She's yours tonight...

10:57.598 --> 10:59.641
...and the moon is--"

11:09.360 --> 11:10.610
Gee.

11:11.487 --> 11:14.281
Gee, that hurt me, that....
You really hurt me.

11:14.699 --> 11:18.201
If you're trying to scare me,
you did a pretty swell job, all right.

11:18.369 --> 11:20.745
My leg will be black and blue tomorrow.

11:22.832 --> 11:27.586
You know, this house is roomy and cool.
You see how cool it is.

11:28.087 --> 11:31.590
I intend moving to England
or Florence forever.

11:31.757 --> 11:33.091
You can move in.

11:33.259 --> 11:36.261
I've got some nice friends
who could come and keep you company.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.346
You could use them
as pieces of furniture.

11:39.724 --> 11:42.267
There's one guy who looks
just like a bookcase.

11:42.768 --> 11:46.521
I could fix for you to attend executions.
How would you like that?

11:46.689 --> 11:51.109
Just you there, nobody else,
just watching. Watch.

11:51.277 --> 11:53.361
Do you like watching, captain?

11:53.529 --> 11:56.948
Because not many people know that....

12:00.369 --> 12:02.662
That the chair is painted yellow.

12:03.247 --> 12:05.332
You'd be the only guy in the know.

12:05.499 --> 12:07.667
Imagine! Your friends,
you could tell them....

12:09.045 --> 12:10.045
Oh, that hurts!

12:25.436 --> 12:27.520
Having recently arrived in America...

12:28.272 --> 12:31.107
...where so many Europeans had found
a haven before...

12:31.817 --> 12:34.569
...I decided to spend
a peaceful summer...

12:34.737 --> 12:38.865
...in the attractive resort town
of Ramsdale, New Hampshire.

12:39.325 --> 12:42.702
Some English translations I had made
of French poetry...

12:42.870 --> 12:45.413
...had enjoyed some success
and I had been appointed...

12:45.581 --> 12:50.377
...to a lectureship at Beardsley College,
Ohio, in the fall.

12:50.961 --> 12:53.421
Friends had given me several addresses
in Ramsdale...

12:53.589 --> 12:56.675
...where lodgings were available
for the summer.

13:00.471 --> 13:03.682
Mr. Hofsteader said that
you're going to be staying all summer.

13:03.849 --> 13:05.809
Well, that was only a tentative plan.

13:05.976 --> 13:09.562
Monsieur, if what you're needing
is peace and quiet...

13:09.730 --> 13:12.399
...I can assure you,
you couldn't get more peace anywhere.

13:12.566 --> 13:13.983
- Yes, it is very--
- Ha-ha-ha.

13:15.486 --> 13:16.653
It is very peaceful.

13:16.821 --> 13:18.613
Now, this would be your room.

13:18.781 --> 13:23.493
It's, uh, what you might call a studio.
Well, you know, a semi-studio affair.

13:23.661 --> 13:25.453
It's very male, heh...

13:26.038 --> 13:27.539
...and quiet.

13:27.832 --> 13:30.750
We're really very fortunate
here in West Ramsdale.

13:31.085 --> 13:33.628
Culturally,
we're a very advanced group...

13:33.796 --> 13:38.466
...with lots of good Anglo-Dutch
and Anglo-Scotch stock...

13:38.759 --> 13:41.594
...and we're very progressive
intellectually.

13:41.762 --> 13:43.471
That is immediately apparent.

13:43.639 --> 13:46.683
I do hope you'll want to address
our club.

13:46.851 --> 13:49.269
Uh, there's a nice view
from this window...

13:49.478 --> 13:51.104
...uh, of the front lawn.

13:51.647 --> 13:54.482
And a good place
for you to do your writing.

13:54.817 --> 13:57.652
- Shelves for your books.
- That's very nice, yes.

13:57.820 --> 14:00.655
I am chairman of
the Great Books Committee.

14:01.198 --> 14:03.533
As a matter of fact, you know...

14:03.701 --> 14:07.370
...one of the speakers
that I had, um, last season...

14:07.538 --> 14:08.747
...was Clare Quilty.

14:08.914 --> 14:10.165
Clare Quilty?

14:10.332 --> 14:12.459
The writer, TV?

14:12.626 --> 14:14.377
- TV plays?
- No, I wouldn't....

14:14.545 --> 14:16.880
He's a very stimulating type of man.

14:17.131 --> 14:20.967
He gave us a talk on a Dr. Schweitzer
and Dr. Zhivago.

14:21.135 --> 14:24.012
- Schweitzer and Zhivago. Very nice.
- Uh-huh.

14:25.264 --> 14:29.684
Oh, no, no, the bathroom's back here,
right next door.

14:30.186 --> 14:34.063
Well, we still have that good,
old-fashioned quaint plumbing.

14:34.231 --> 14:35.857
Should appeal to a European.

14:41.697 --> 14:45.283
Oh! Excuse the soiled sock.

14:47.453 --> 14:50.789
I see that you're interested in art.
In that case....

14:50.956 --> 14:53.374
In that case you really must see...

14:53.542 --> 14:56.753
...uh, the collection of reproductions
I have in my bedroom.

14:58.130 --> 14:59.172
Voilà!

14:59.340 --> 15:00.840
Oh, yes, that's....

15:01.008 --> 15:02.050
A Dufy.

15:02.218 --> 15:03.218
That's very....

15:03.385 --> 15:06.513
And there's my little van Gogh. Monet.

15:07.389 --> 15:09.140
Is, uh, Madame Humbert....

15:09.308 --> 15:11.935
- There's no madame. We are divorced.
- Oh.

15:12.102 --> 15:13.520
Happily divorced.

15:14.104 --> 15:17.524
- When did all this happen?
- About a year ago in Paris.

15:17.942 --> 15:20.985
Paris, France, madame. Heh.

15:21.529 --> 15:25.198
You know, monsieur, I believe
that it's only in the Romance languages...

15:25.366 --> 15:28.243
...that one is able to really relate
in a mature fashion.

15:28.410 --> 15:29.786
Mm-hm.

15:30.287 --> 15:32.747
In fact, I remember
when the late Mr. Haze and I--

15:32.915 --> 15:34.499
Oh, the late Mr. Haze?

15:34.667 --> 15:37.085
- Yes, he's passed on.
- Oh.

15:37.253 --> 15:40.797
But, uh, when we were on
our honeymoon abroad...

15:41.507 --> 15:45.718
...I knew that I'd never felt married
until I heard myself addressed as "señora."

15:47.096 --> 15:49.305
- You were in Spain?
- No, Mexico.

15:49.598 --> 15:50.890
Mexico. Hmm.

15:51.809 --> 15:54.894
There were so many places
we had planned to travel...

15:55.145 --> 15:57.939
...but he was occupied
with his work.

15:58.107 --> 16:00.441
- He was in insurance.
- Oh.

16:00.609 --> 16:02.569
Left me well-provided for.

16:03.904 --> 16:07.240
- He was a lovely human being.
- Oh.

16:08.075 --> 16:10.118
A man of complete integrity.

16:11.161 --> 16:15.248
I know you would have liked to talk
to the late Mr. Haze, and he to you.

16:15.416 --> 16:16.958
Yes, I'm sure I would have.

16:17.126 --> 16:18.626
Those are his ashes.

- That's all right.

we first met at a dance...

22:22.950 --> 22:27.870
...and I was sort of sitting it out,
you know, and so he just sat it out too.

as you have her home by midnight.

27:52.988 --> 27:56.156
But, Charlotte,
tonight's a special occasion.

27:56.324 --> 27:58.534
Why don't you have Lolita stay over
with Mona?

27:58.702 --> 28:00.995
John can bring her back in the morning,
can't you?

28:01.162 --> 28:03.622
- Yeah, sure.
- That would be too much trouble.

28:03.790 --> 28:07.042
- Of course not.
- No, it's the easiest thing in the world.

28:07.377 --> 28:11.005
- Mm, well, uh....
- It's settled. It's settled.

28:11.965 --> 28:14.633
Well, I guess we'd better say good night
to you two kids.

28:14.801 --> 28:17.469
John and I have to get home
and kind of supervise things.

28:17.637 --> 28:20.097
You know, what she means is
keep the lights on.

28:20.265 --> 28:24.935
- I think we ought to come over and help.
- No, we wouldn't think of it, Humbert. No.

28:25.103 --> 28:29.356
- It's no trouble at all, is it, Charlotte?
- Well, Jean, perhaps we should....

28:29.524 --> 28:31.775

the right time or place--

Not another word until we've finished
our pink champagne.

29:18.073 --> 29:20.282
Well, um....

29:20.450 --> 29:23.786
In a sense, this is none of my business,
but I've come to feel almost...

29:23.953 --> 29:26.830
...like a member of the family
as far as Lolita is concerned.

29:26.998 --> 29:29.208
Yes, I know, and I appreciate it.

29:29.376 --> 29:33.003
Uh, I've come to feel as if
you're a member of the family too.

29:33.171 --> 29:35.798
I wonder if you aren't being
too liberal with her?

29:35.965 --> 29:37.174
Liberal?

29:37.342 --> 29:39.760
Oh, you dear man. Ha-ha-ha.

Oh, you dear, sweet, naive man.

29:42.097 --> 29:45.516
No, I don't think you realize
that she's beginning to grow up.

29:45.684 --> 29:48.060
Of course she's beginning to grow up...

29:48.228 --> 29:50.354
...and it's only natural and healthy...

29:51.773 --> 29:55.359
...that, uh, she should, uh, take an interest
in those fascinating creatures...

29:55.527 --> 29:59.113
...known as the opposite sex.

29:59.447 --> 30:02.783
Cheerio. But should she be allowed
to stay out all night?

30:03.368 --> 30:05.202
She's not staying out.

30:05.745 --> 30:07.746
She's at Jean and John's.

30:07.956 --> 30:10.791
Yes, but there's something about them
that makes me wonder...

30:10.959 --> 30:14.336
...whether they would provide
the right kind of supervision.

30:14.796 --> 30:16.296
Oh, ha-ha-ha.

30:16.464 --> 30:19.883
Hum, you're so charmingly Old World...

30:20.051 --> 30:23.220
...but then,
that's what I adore about you.

30:24.639 --> 30:26.140
I have a proposal.

30:26.307 --> 30:30.436
What say you I teach you
some of the new steps?

30:30.603 --> 30:33.313
Oh, Charlotte,
I don't even know the old ones.

30:33.481 --> 30:37.317
And you do this so very well
I'd much rather sit down and watch you.

30:37.986 --> 30:39.570
You're very good.

30:40.739 --> 30:42.281
Come on, Humbert.

30:43.408 --> 30:46.452
Humbert Humbert,
what a thrillingly different name.

30:47.036 --> 30:51.915
Do you pronounce the surname differently?
You know, in a slightly lower tone.

30:52.083 --> 30:54.877
Let's see. Uh, Humbert.

30:55.044 --> 30:57.171
What was that, the first or the second?

30:57.922 --> 31:01.884
Seriously, I'm an awkward tripper
and I have no sense of rhythm.

31:02.927 --> 31:05.220
I refuse to believe that about you.

31:07.515 --> 31:09.099
Rhythm is so basic...

31:09.350 --> 31:13.979
...and it just pours out of you,
you simply vibrate rhythm.

31:15.148 --> 31:16.940
Well, I'll just....

31:17.776 --> 31:21.528
- I'll clap my hands and you go on dancing.
- Now, come on, Humbert.

31:21.696 --> 31:23.781
And that was not your surname.

31:23.948 --> 31:25.866
Now, put your hands here.

31:26.951 --> 31:28.202
Tighter.

31:31.289 --> 31:33.457
All right, ready, go.

31:33.625 --> 31:35.709
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

31:35.877 --> 31:37.753
One, two, cha-cha-cha.

31:39.005 --> 31:40.297
Very good.

31:41.299 --> 31:43.425
A little more joie de vivre.

31:44.511 --> 31:45.803
One, two....

31:45.970 --> 31:49.556
You know, when you smile like that
you remind me of someone.

31:49.849 --> 31:51.975
Oh, uh....

31:52.143 --> 31:54.853
A college boy I had a date with.

31:55.021 --> 31:58.732
I went dancing with him,
a young blue-blooded Bostonian.

31:58.900 --> 32:01.401
My very first glamour date.

32:01.611 --> 32:02.903
Oh, ha, ha.

32:03.071 --> 32:04.613
And, you know...

32:04.781 --> 32:07.491
...in certain lights
you remind me of Harold.

32:07.826 --> 32:09.993
You mean, the late Mr....

32:10.161 --> 32:11.203
Yes.

32:11.371 --> 32:14.498
You're really very different, of course.

32:14.666 --> 32:16.458
Yes, I imagine I am.

32:17.252 --> 32:20.295
But, you know, I adored Harold.

32:20.463 --> 32:24.216
I really did. I swore at the time
I would never marry again.

32:24.425 --> 32:26.552
I don't think I will, but....

32:26.719 --> 32:29.096
It wouldn't be fair to his memory,
do you think?

32:29.264 --> 32:32.516
No, one doesn't often find
such loyalty these days.

32:33.017 --> 32:35.143
But sometimes, Hum, I wonder...

32:36.604 --> 32:38.397
...shouldn't life be for the living?

32:38.565 --> 32:39.982
What think you?

32:40.149 --> 32:43.360
You see,
I'm a strongly emotional woman.

32:43.528 --> 32:45.654
Very strongly emotional.

32:46.948 --> 32:49.491
- Don't be afraid of hurting me.
- No, I'm not, really.

32:49.659 --> 32:51.368
Take me in your arms.

32:51.536 --> 32:55.289
I can't live in the past.
Not anymore, Hum, not anymore.

32:56.708 --> 32:57.958
Hi.

32:59.294 --> 33:01.003
Lolita!

33:02.380 --> 33:03.672
Uh, darling.

33:05.800 --> 33:07.134
Cha-cha-cha.

33:08.094 --> 33:09.636
Uh, darling.

33:10.221 --> 33:12.097
Did you come back for something?

33:12.265 --> 33:15.809
No, Mona's party turned out
to be sort of a drag.

33:15.977 --> 33:18.395
I thought I'd come back
and see what you were doing.

33:18.563 --> 33:22.399
We had a wonderful evening.
Your mother created a magnificent spread.

33:22.567 --> 33:24.109
Did you have something to eat?

33:24.277 --> 33:27.613
They served some kind of salty fish eggs,
but I didn't like them.

33:27.780 --> 33:30.616
I'll make you a sandwich.
There's lots of food left over.

33:30.783 --> 33:32.576
That's great. I'm starving.

33:32.744 --> 33:36.288
I don't think she should be stuffing herself
when she should go to sleep.

33:36.456 --> 33:37.581
But, Mom...

33:38.541 --> 33:41.585
...I'm hungry and I've got to have
something to eat.

33:42.420 --> 33:43.587
All right.

33:44.589 --> 33:47.799
Uh, but you take it upstairs
and after you've eaten it...

33:47.967 --> 33:50.135
...you go right to sleep.

33:52.221 --> 33:54.806
Did you have a good time
dancing with Clare Quilty?

33:54.974 --> 33:56.433
Well, of course...

33:56.601 --> 33:58.936
...he's a very erudite gentleman.

33:59.103 --> 34:02.314
Yeah, I know.
All the girls are crazy about him too.

34:02.482 --> 34:04.691
That's neither here nor there.

34:05.735 --> 34:06.735
Since when?

34:06.903 --> 34:09.696
Here we are. Excuse me.

34:09.906 --> 34:12.324
Loaded with mayonnaise,
just the way you like it.

34:12.492 --> 34:13.699
Thank you.

34:14.327 --> 34:17.454
Uh, darling, take it upstairs.

34:17.705 --> 34:19.956
I don't want to go to bed.
It's too early.

34:20.123 --> 34:24.127
Ha. Uh, we all think that Lo
should go to bed.

34:24.295 --> 34:26.964
I don't have to. This is a free country.

34:27.966 --> 34:30.926
Which means there will be
no allowance this week.

34:31.094 --> 34:32.969
Which means I think you stink this week.

34:33.137 --> 34:34.888
To bed this instant!

34:35.056 --> 34:36.223
Go to bed.

34:36.391 --> 34:37.724
I heard that.

34:41.478 --> 34:42.688
Good night, Lo.

34:47.318 --> 34:48.985
That miserable little brat.

34:49.152 --> 34:52.364
She is becoming impossible,
simply impossible.

34:52.532 --> 34:56.076
The idea.... The idea of her
sneaking back here and spying on us.

34:56.244 --> 34:57.869
I don't think she was spying on us.

34:58.037 --> 34:59.538
Really? What would you call it?

34:59.706 --> 35:01.206
I'm sure she intended no harm.

35:01.374 --> 35:05.460
Like hell she didn't!
She's always been a spiteful little pest.

35:05.628 --> 35:08.547
Since the age of 1. Do you know
she kept throwing her toys...

35:08.715 --> 35:12.509
...out of her crib so that I would have
to keep stooping over to pick them up.

35:12.677 --> 35:15.178
She has always had some kind
of gripe against me.

35:15.346 --> 35:17.931
Now she sees herself
as some kind of a starlet.

35:18.099 --> 35:22.644
Well, I see her as a sturdy,
healthy but decidedly homely child.

35:23.187 --> 35:26.148
I mean, is it my fault if I feel young?

35:26.441 --> 35:29.693
Why should my child resent it?
You don't resent it, do you?

35:29.861 --> 35:33.864
Do you think I'm just a foolish,
romantic American girl?

35:34.240 --> 35:35.949
No. No, no, no.

35:41.873 --> 35:43.290
Let's, uh, heh....

35:44.083 --> 35:48.628
Why don't I throw on a wrap and we can
go out for a little ride in the car?

35:48.796 --> 35:51.006
Well, it's a little late, Charlotte.

35:52.050 --> 35:55.302
Well, let's at least, uh, finish
our champagne, shall we?

35:55.470 --> 35:59.014
I've had a very exhausting evening.
I think I'd best go to bed.

35:59.182 --> 36:01.183
But it's not even 1.

36:01.350 --> 36:06.521
My neuralgia's about to strike
with heartburn, an old ally, and so....

36:07.231 --> 36:10.358
Good night, and thank you
for a charming evening.

36:11.944 --> 36:13.737
You're very welcome.

36:47.355 --> 36:52.067
What drives me insane is
the twofold nature of this nymphet.

36:52.235 --> 36:53.527
Of every nymphet, perhaps.

36:54.112 --> 36:58.698
This mixture in my Lolita of tender,
dreamy childishness...

36:59.283 --> 37:01.701
...and a kind of eerie vulgarity.

37:02.453 --> 37:07.624
I know it is madness to keep this journal,
but it gives me a strange thrill to do so...

37:07.792 --> 37:11.378
...and only a loving wife could decipher
my microscopic script.

37:20.805 --> 37:23.974
Miss, in this house, we do not eat
with the table on the el--

37:24.142 --> 37:25.892
Elbows on the tables.

37:27.979 --> 37:29.938
Must you pamper your pimples?

37:31.190 --> 37:34.359
Do you mind if I eat?
I've got to meet Mona.

37:34.652 --> 37:38.071
Oh. This morning you have to meet Mona.
Last night--

37:38.656 --> 37:40.991
First you wash every dish,
then you go upstairs...

37:41.159 --> 37:43.201
...and make your bed
and clean up your room.

37:43.369 --> 37:47.330
I am not picking up after you today,
miss, or any day!

37:56.048 --> 37:57.507
Hello. Excuse me.

37:57.758 --> 38:00.886
- Is it Kenny?
- No. Just a minute.

38:01.762 --> 38:03.889
Uh, Jean, uh, just a second.

38:04.307 --> 38:08.727
Take this tray up to Professor Humbert
and do not disturb him.

38:09.437 --> 38:12.063
- Yes, ma'am!
- Yes, ma'am.

38:12.815 --> 38:13.899
Jean?

38:14.400 --> 38:16.359
I'm very glad you called.

38:16.903 --> 38:18.028
Yes.

38:18.571 --> 38:20.030
Oh!

38:20.239 --> 38:21.448
Mona?

38:22.491 --> 38:23.617
What time?

38:24.827 --> 38:27.287
Well, I'm very glad you called me, Jean.

38:27.455 --> 38:31.124
Well, there's something very important
we both have to talk about.

38:31.292 --> 38:33.710
That's a good idea.
Well, I'd rather not....

38:34.170 --> 38:36.379
- Who is it?
- Lolita.

38:37.965 --> 38:39.090
Come in.

38:42.678 --> 38:43.970
Here's your breakfast.

38:44.138 --> 38:45.764
Thank you very much. Good morning.

38:45.932 --> 38:47.474
Good morning.

38:50.895 --> 38:53.563
Don't tell Mom,
but I ate all your bacon.

38:54.649 --> 38:56.983
You have a very long face today.

38:57.401 --> 38:58.568
Oh, yeah?

39:03.699 --> 39:05.575
What were you writing?

39:06.994 --> 39:09.704
I was writing a poem.

39:09.997 --> 39:11.539
Mm-hm?

39:11.916 --> 39:13.083
What's it about?

39:13.251 --> 39:14.876
It's about people.

39:15.044 --> 39:16.336
Hmm.

39:16.796 --> 39:18.505
That's a novel subject.

39:19.423 --> 39:23.260
You know, it's funny, it sort of looked
like a diary when I came in.

39:23.511 --> 39:28.515
I always write my poems in a diary.
It's one of my little idiosyncrasies.

39:28.683 --> 39:29.849
Mm.

39:31.936 --> 39:35.897
Afraid somebody's gonna steal your ideas
and sell them to Hollywood?

39:36.065 --> 39:39.359
Perhaps. Would you like me
to read you some poetry?

39:40.027 --> 39:41.444
Sure, why not?

39:43.197 --> 39:44.948
This is my favorite poet.

39:46.993 --> 39:48.785
- It was--
- Who's the poet?

39:49.245 --> 39:50.829
The divine Edgar.

39:51.122 --> 39:52.956
Who's the divine Edgar? Edgar who?

39:53.124 --> 39:55.166
- Edgar Allan Poe, of course.
- Mm.

39:55.584 --> 39:57.794
It was night in the lonesome October

39:57.962 --> 40:00.547
Of my most immemorial year

40:00.715 --> 40:03.216
Notice how he emphasizes this word.

40:03.801 --> 40:06.344
It was hard by the dim lake of Auber

40:06.512 --> 40:09.139
In the misty mid region of Weir

40:09.307 --> 40:13.018
You see, he takes a word like "dim"
in one line and twists it, you see?

40:13.185 --> 40:15.979
And it comes back as
"mid region of Weir."

40:17.023 --> 40:19.607
"Mid region," and twists it to "dim."

40:19.900 --> 40:22.277
That's pretty good, pretty clever.

40:23.070 --> 40:25.697
Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her

40:25.906 --> 40:28.867
And conquered her scruples and gloom

40:29.327 --> 40:31.703
And we passed to the end of the vista

40:31.871 --> 40:34.331
But were stopped by the door of a tomb

40:34.498 --> 40:37.167
And I said,
"What is written, sweet sister?"

40:37.335 --> 40:41.463
She replied, "Ulalume, Ulalume"

40:42.506 --> 40:45.550
Well, I think it's a little corny,
to tell you the truth.

40:45.718 --> 40:47.552
What do you object to?

40:48.387 --> 40:51.848
Well, the "vista-sister,"
that's like "Lolita-sweeter."

40:52.391 --> 40:54.768
That's very true.
That's a very acute observation.

40:54.935 --> 40:58.188
If you were in my class
I would give you an A-plus.

40:59.440 --> 41:04.527
Tell me, was Mona Farlow annoyed
when you left her party last night?

41:04.695 --> 41:07.364
Mona? Annoyed? Heh, heh.

41:07.531 --> 41:10.784
Well, I thought she might be
looking forward to....

41:11.369 --> 41:14.120
- Don't worry about Mona.
- Oh?

41:14.872 --> 41:17.874
- Let me tell you something about Mona.
- Do, please.

41:19.627 --> 41:22.712
No, I'd better not tell you.
You'll blab.

41:22.880 --> 41:26.132
I will never give away
any of your secrets.

41:26.300 --> 41:28.051
- You wouldn't?
- I promise.

41:28.969 --> 41:30.261
Oh.

41:31.597 --> 41:33.807
Well, for that you get a little reward.

41:33.974 --> 41:35.725
Thank you very much.

41:36.185 --> 41:38.019
- Here!
- Oh, no, please. No.

41:38.813 --> 41:41.189
Lolita. No.

41:41.357 --> 41:42.899
Put your head back.

41:43.192 --> 41:44.692
Put your head back.

41:46.195 --> 41:47.737
Open your mouth.

41:48.197 --> 41:50.198
You can have one little bite.

41:52.827 --> 41:54.327
Lolita?

41:57.415 --> 41:58.998
Lolita!

41:59.166 --> 42:00.375
What?

42:01.419 --> 42:02.919
Come down here.

42:07.216 --> 42:08.758
What do you want?

42:09.385 --> 42:10.510
Firstly...

42:11.512 --> 42:13.972
...when I call you I want you
to come right down...

42:14.140 --> 42:17.016
...and not make me holler for you
from room to room.

42:17.184 --> 42:18.184
Yes, ma'am.

42:18.352 --> 42:21.855
Secondly, I want you to go
right into your room and put on a dress.

42:22.022 --> 42:24.482
I'm going to the Farlows
and I want you to come.

42:24.650 --> 42:26.651
But I'm supposed to meet Mona
at the lake.

42:26.819 --> 42:30.447
And lastly, I forbid you
to disturb Professor Humbert again.

42:30.614 --> 42:33.533
He is a writer and he is not
to be disturbed.

42:33.701 --> 42:35.118
Sieg Heil.

42:40.124 --> 42:42.876
You know,
I have a glorious surprise for us.

42:43.836 --> 42:47.046
- Uh, one of your dramatic sweets?
- Mm-mm.

42:47.214 --> 42:48.548
Guess again.

42:52.094 --> 42:54.137
The Farlows have been arrested.

42:54.597 --> 42:56.890
Really, Hum. Thank you, Louise.

42:57.516 --> 42:59.476
I'm no good at guessing.

43:00.936 --> 43:03.771
Mona Farlow is leaving
for summer camp tomorrow.

43:04.648 --> 43:06.649
Lolita is going with her.

43:07.526 --> 43:09.652
You were absolutely right
when you warned me...

43:09.820 --> 43:12.614
...that I was getting too liberal
with her about boys.

43:12.781 --> 43:15.617
What's more, Mona disappeared
from that party last night...

43:15.784 --> 43:18.411
...and she did not come home
till 4 a.m.

43:18.621 --> 43:21.789
So Jean and I decided
that isolation from boys...

43:21.999 --> 43:25.919
...would be the best thing
for both of the girls this crucial summer.

43:26.253 --> 43:27.504
Yes.

43:29.757 --> 43:32.300
Do you think that the camp
is the answer?

43:32.635 --> 43:35.011
Frankly, Hum, I do.
And it's all arranged.

43:35.471 --> 43:38.556
The Farlows and I phoned
the camp long-distance...

43:38.724 --> 43:41.434
...heh, and I did all the shopping this....

43:41.602 --> 43:43.978
Is something the matter with your face?

43:44.146 --> 43:46.439
- Toothache.
- You poor man.

43:46.899 --> 43:50.777
If it still pains you tomorrow,
I'll call and arrange an appointment.

43:51.612 --> 43:53.071
How far away is this camp?

43:53.239 --> 43:57.700
Mm, two hundred miles.
It was a stroke of genius on Mama's part.

43:58.536 --> 44:00.954
Ah. Ain't I clever?

44:02.873 --> 44:06.960
Shall we, um, take our coffee
out to the piazza...

44:07.461 --> 44:10.588
...or do you want to go upstairs
and nurse that tooth?

44:15.636 --> 44:17.136
Nurse the tooth.

44:53.424 --> 44:55.091
I'll be right back.

45:05.936 --> 45:08.104
Well, I guess I won't be
seeing you again, huh?

45:09.857 --> 45:12.066
I shall be moving on.

45:12.234 --> 45:15.570
I must prepare for my work
at Beardsley College in the fall.

45:16.196 --> 45:18.406
Then I guess this is goodbye.

45:20.826 --> 45:22.118
Yes.

45:23.329 --> 45:24.871
Don't forget me.

46:29.561 --> 46:31.562
Are you upstairs, Mr. Humbert?

46:33.857 --> 46:35.108
Mr. Humbert!

46:43.701 --> 46:46.202
Mrs. Haze asked me to give you this.

46:46.412 --> 46:48.246
Thank you very much. Ahem.

47:02.344 --> 47:04.053
"This is a confession.

47:05.389 --> 47:06.806
I love you.

47:07.850 --> 47:11.561
Last Sunday in church, my dear one,
when I asked the Lord...

47:11.729 --> 47:16.441
...what to do about it,
I was told to act as I am acting now.

47:17.234 --> 47:19.569
You see, there is no alternative.

47:19.820 --> 47:22.447
I have loved you from the minute
I saw you.

47:23.073 --> 47:27.201
I am a passionate and lonely woman...

47:27.745 --> 47:30.037
...and you are the love of my life.

47:30.456 --> 47:31.956
Now you know.

47:32.750 --> 47:35.877
So you will please, at once,
pack and leave.

47:36.253 --> 47:40.006
This is a landlady's order.
I am dismissing a lodger.

47:40.424 --> 47:44.177
I am kicking you out.
Go, scram, départez!

47:44.887 --> 47:48.639
I shall be back by dinnertime.
I do not wish to find you in the house.

47:48.807 --> 47:51.559
You see, chérie...

47:52.102 --> 47:55.021
...if you decided to stay,
if I found you at home...

47:55.189 --> 47:57.273
...which I know I won't...

47:57.608 --> 48:01.194
...and that's why I'm able
to go on like this...

48:01.945 --> 48:05.907
...the fact of your remaining
would only mean one thing: that you....

48:09.912 --> 48:12.789
That you want me as much as I do you...

48:13.624 --> 48:15.708
...as a lifelong mate...

48:17.377 --> 48:22.548
...and you are ready to link up your life
with mine forever and ever...

48:22.716 --> 48:25.468
...and be a father to my little girl.

48:25.636 --> 48:27.261
Goodbye, dear one.

48:28.347 --> 48:30.014
Pray for me...

48:31.475 --> 48:33.100
...if you ever pray."

49:04.132 --> 49:05.466
Hum?

49:09.972 --> 49:11.264
Hum?

49:14.643 --> 49:16.102
Hum, baby.

49:18.397 --> 49:21.190
The wedding was a quiet affair...

49:21.900 --> 49:25.403
...and when called upon to enjoy
my promotion from lodger to lover...

49:25.571 --> 49:28.698
...did I experience only bitterness
and distaste?

49:29.366 --> 49:34.453
No. Mr. Humbert confesses
to a certain titillation of his vanity...

49:34.955 --> 49:38.958
...to some faint tenderness,
even to a pattern of remorse...

49:39.251 --> 49:42.879
...daintily running along the steel
of his conspiratorial dagger.

49:43.046 --> 49:44.797
Dear, the door's locked.

49:44.965 --> 49:46.048
Mm-hm.

49:49.803 --> 49:53.014
Sweetheart, I don't want
any secrets between us.

49:53.348 --> 49:55.308
It makes me feel insecure.

49:56.685 --> 49:58.644
Can't this wait till I come out of here?

50:03.984 --> 50:05.651
I suppose.

50:11.408 --> 50:13.868
Hum, what do you do in there so long?

50:14.036 --> 50:15.953
I wanna talk to you.

50:17.748 --> 50:22.001
I haven't been here long.
In point of fact, I only just came in.

50:23.837 --> 50:27.048
Were there a lot of women
in your life before me?

50:27.215 --> 50:29.592
I've told you about them already.

50:31.136 --> 50:32.970
Well, you didn't tell me...

50:34.264 --> 50:35.848
...about all of them.

50:37.434 --> 50:40.144
Charlotte, if it would make you
any happier...

50:40.312 --> 50:43.105
...I will sit right down
and make out a complete list...

50:43.273 --> 50:45.274
...of every woman I have ever known.

50:45.442 --> 50:46.734
Would that satisfy you?

50:48.487 --> 50:50.655
I'm lonesome.

50:55.494 --> 50:58.079
I think it's healthy
for me to be jealous.

50:58.789 --> 51:00.790
It means that I love you.

51:05.504 --> 51:07.713
You know how happy I can make you.

51:07.881 --> 51:10.716
Mm-hm.

51:14.513 --> 51:15.763
But, uh...

51:16.473 --> 51:20.726
...Charlotte, I haven't even had
my morning cup of coffee yet.

51:23.814 --> 51:26.023
You want me to make you some?

51:26.191 --> 51:28.901
Please do that, like a good little wife.

51:31.989 --> 51:33.197
All right.

51:53.176 --> 51:54.552
Darling....

51:56.430 --> 51:58.556
I don't care about any other woman.

51:58.724 --> 52:02.351
I know that our love is sacred,
the others were profane.

52:02.978 --> 52:05.813
Yes, sacred, that's right,
that's what it is. Mm.

52:06.440 --> 52:07.898
Oh, Hum.

52:08.400 --> 52:10.609
Hum, baby, you know,
I love the way you smell.

52:10.777 --> 52:14.280
Oh! You do arouse the pagan in me.

52:15.615 --> 52:19.869
Hum, you just touch me
and I go as limp as a noodle.

52:20.037 --> 52:21.162
It scares me.

52:21.329 --> 52:22.955
Yes, I know the feeling.

52:26.293 --> 52:28.169
Do you believe in God?

52:32.257 --> 52:34.300
The question is, does God believe in me?

52:34.468 --> 52:36.010
Shh!

52:38.638 --> 52:43.225
I wouldn't care if your maternal
grandfather turned out to be a Turk.

52:44.603 --> 52:46.520
But if I ever found out...

52:47.564 --> 52:50.107
...that you didn't believe in God...

52:52.110 --> 52:53.944
...I think I would commit suicide.

52:54.362 --> 52:56.739
Hey. A gun!

52:58.200 --> 52:59.825
It belonged to Mr. Haze.

52:59.993 --> 53:01.952
You should be careful with those things.

53:02.120 --> 53:03.120
It's not loaded.

53:03.622 --> 53:06.415
That's what they all say,
"I didn't know it was loaded."

53:06.917 --> 53:08.584
This is a sacred weapon.

53:09.753 --> 53:11.462
It's a tragic treasure.

53:12.714 --> 53:16.675
Mr. Haze purchased it
when he found out he was ill.

53:16.968 --> 53:20.137
He wanted to spare me
the sight of his suffering.

53:20.305 --> 53:24.308
Happily or unhappily, he was
hospitalized before he could use it.

53:24.518 --> 53:26.644
Will you put it down, please?

53:28.063 --> 53:29.188
Thank you.

53:30.190 --> 53:31.857
That's better now, isn't it, huh?

53:32.025 --> 53:34.360
Uh-huh? Mm-hm?

53:40.659 --> 53:42.034
Oh, you man!

53:45.163 --> 53:46.288
Darling...

53:47.707 --> 53:49.208
...you know...

53:49.751 --> 53:52.044
...I have a most ambitious fantasy.

53:53.463 --> 53:54.880
What's yours?

53:56.842 --> 54:01.595
I would love to get hold of
a real French servant girl...

54:02.430 --> 54:06.308
...you know, like the German girls
the Farlows had...

54:07.811 --> 54:10.437
...and have her come
and live in the house.

54:10.647 --> 54:11.814
No room.

54:12.983 --> 54:15.025
We could put her in Lo's room.

54:15.360 --> 54:18.863
I've been meaning to make a guest room
out of that hole, anyway.

54:19.239 --> 54:20.823
And where, pray...

54:21.950 --> 54:24.034
...will you put your daughter...

54:24.327 --> 54:26.579
...when you get your guest
or your maid?

54:26.746 --> 54:30.583
You know, I've decided
to send her straight from camp...

54:31.209 --> 54:33.335
...to a good boarding school...

54:33.503 --> 54:36.213
...you know,
with strict religious training...

54:36.381 --> 54:38.382
...and then on to college.

54:39.885 --> 54:43.929
Darling, it's going to be you
and me alone...

54:44.347 --> 54:46.098
...forever.

54:55.859 --> 54:57.902
Darling, you've gone away.

54:58.945 --> 55:02.239
Just a minute,
I'm following a train of thought.

55:15.754 --> 55:17.421
It doesn't matter.

55:21.301 --> 55:22.927
C'est la vie.

55:26.181 --> 55:27.473
Hey.

55:28.016 --> 55:29.725
Am I on that train?

55:31.102 --> 55:32.269
Yes.

55:34.314 --> 55:35.856
I should hope so.

55:40.070 --> 55:41.737
Let's let it ring.

55:46.368 --> 55:47.993
Oh....

55:50.330 --> 55:51.705
Hello?

55:53.375 --> 55:55.626
Yes, this is Mrs. Charlotte Humbert.

55:56.920 --> 55:58.128
Oh, uh....

55:58.296 --> 56:02.424
I'll accept the charges. It's Lolita.
She's calling long-distance.

56:03.301 --> 56:04.635
Hello?

56:05.345 --> 56:06.971
Hello, dear.

56:07.138 --> 56:08.514
We're fine.

56:11.476 --> 56:12.559
Yes.

56:14.980 --> 56:18.023
We spent the honeymoon
on Hourglass Lake.

56:18.316 --> 56:20.693
Well, with a few other young marrieds.

56:21.278 --> 56:23.279
Is anything wrong?

56:24.406 --> 56:26.198
You lost your new sweater?

56:28.743 --> 56:30.160
In the woods?

56:31.329 --> 56:32.746
Uh....

56:33.540 --> 56:35.082
Yes, he's here.

56:36.793 --> 56:39.003
What do you want to thank him for?

56:40.255 --> 56:41.422
Candy.

56:42.590 --> 56:43.882
Just a minute.

56:44.342 --> 56:49.513
Hum, I really wish that you would not
send her candy without consulting me.

56:50.890 --> 56:52.182
Hum.

56:52.934 --> 56:54.601
I'm talking to you.

56:58.023 --> 57:01.650
Even in the most harmonious households,
such as ours...

57:01.818 --> 57:04.737
...not all the decisions are taken
by the female...

57:04.904 --> 57:08.741
...especially when the male partner
has fulfilled his obligations...

57:08.992 --> 57:10.826
...beyond the line of duty.

57:10.994 --> 57:14.371
When you wanted me to spend
my afternoons sunbathing by the lake...

57:14.539 --> 57:17.249
...I was glad to become
the bronzed glamour boy for you...

57:17.417 --> 57:19.084
...instead of remaining the scholar.

57:19.419 --> 57:24.048
Even then I scoot along after you
like an obliging little lapdog.

57:24.215 --> 57:28.093
Yes, I'm happy. I'm delighted
to be bossed by you...

57:28.261 --> 57:29.762
...but every game has its rules.

57:39.481 --> 57:40.522
Lolita?

58:42.961 --> 58:46.171
No man can bring about
the perfect murder.

58:46.798 --> 58:48.882
Chance, however, can do it.

58:52.512 --> 58:55.556
Just minutes ago she had said
it wasn't loaded.

58:55.932 --> 58:59.059
What if I had playfully pulled
the trigger then?

59:02.021 --> 59:05.816
"She said it wasn't loaded.
It belonged to the late Mr. Haze.

59:06.025 --> 59:08.152
She was having her morning tub.

59:08.361 --> 59:11.864
We had just finished talking
about our plans for the future.

59:12.699 --> 59:16.577
I decided to play a practical joke
and pretend I was a burglar.

59:16.744 --> 59:20.747
We were newlyweds and still did things
like that to each other.

59:21.708 --> 59:26.879
As soon as it happened I called
an ambulance, but it was too late."

59:28.214 --> 59:29.840
Simple, isn't it?

59:30.967 --> 59:32.885
The perfect murder.

01:00:17.972 --> 01:00:22.476
She splashed in the tub,
a trustful, clumsy seal...

01:00:23.269 --> 01:00:27.105
...and all the logic of passion
screamed in my ear:

01:00:28.274 --> 01:00:30.150
"Now is the time."

01:00:31.277 --> 01:00:34.071
But, what do you know, folks...

01:00:34.239 --> 01:00:37.115
...I just couldn't make myself do it.

01:00:38.368 --> 01:00:41.245
The scream grew
more and more remote...

01:00:41.412 --> 01:00:45.749
...and I realized the melancholy fact
that neither tomorrow nor Friday...

01:00:45.917 --> 01:00:48.585
...nor any other day or night...

01:00:48.753 --> 01:00:51.755
...could I make myself put her to death.

01:01:03.142 --> 01:01:04.560
Charlotte?

01:01:15.697 --> 01:01:17.155
Darling?

01:01:19.617 --> 01:01:20.659
Darling?

01:01:22.453 --> 01:01:23.620
Darling?

01:01:27.333 --> 01:01:30.335
That's my diary. We don't read
other people's diaries, do we?

01:01:31.504 --> 01:01:34.423
Charlotte, that's my diary.
Give it to me, please.

01:01:36.134 --> 01:01:37.884
Please. No, no.

01:01:38.177 --> 01:01:39.678
"The Haze woman.

01:01:41.764 --> 01:01:43.098
The cow.

01:01:44.601 --> 01:01:46.602
The obnoxious mama.

01:01:46.853 --> 01:01:49.354
The brainless baba."

01:01:49.606 --> 01:01:52.524
Well, the stupid Haze is
no longer your dupe.

01:01:52.692 --> 01:01:53.734
Give me that, please.

01:01:53.901 --> 01:01:56.236
You leave that alone
or I'll scream out the window!

01:01:56.404 --> 01:01:59.489
Quiet. Let's discuss this.
Let's sit and discuss it quietly...

01:01:59.657 --> 01:02:01.950
- ...like civilized people.
- You're a monster.

01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:06.622
You're a disgusting, despicable,
loathsome, criminal fraud!

01:02:06.789 --> 01:02:08.290
Don't do that.

01:02:09.417 --> 01:02:11.585
- I can expl--
- Get out of my way.

01:02:11.753 --> 01:02:13.879
- I'm getting out of here.
- No. I want to talk--

01:02:14.047 --> 01:02:16.173
Go on, get out of my way.

01:02:17.842 --> 01:02:19.551
I'm leaving here today.

01:02:20.887 --> 01:02:22.346
You can have all of it.

01:02:22.513 --> 01:02:26.892
But you are never going to see
that miserable brat again!

01:02:27.185 --> 01:02:28.977
Charlotte, please, listen to me.

01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.563
Charlotte, come here, please.

01:02:33.274 --> 01:02:35.150
Charlotte, open the door!

01:02:35.318 --> 01:02:36.985
I want to speak to you.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:39.237
This is so easy to explain.

01:02:39.405 --> 01:02:42.574
It's an hallucination.
You're crazy, Charlotte.

01:02:44.077 --> 01:02:48.205
I'll get you a drink.
That's what you want, a nice little drink.

01:02:50.416 --> 01:02:52.501
Harold, look what happened.

01:02:54.337 --> 01:02:56.296
I was disloyal to you.

01:02:57.090 --> 01:02:58.924
I couldn't help it, though.

01:02:59.342 --> 01:03:01.927
Seven years is a very long time.

01:03:03.596 --> 01:03:06.264
Why did you go and die on me?!

01:03:08.643 --> 01:03:11.978
I didn't know anything about life,
I was very young.

01:03:13.106 --> 01:03:16.650
If you hadn't died,
all this wouldn't have happened!

01:03:19.987 --> 01:03:21.571
Darling, forgive me.

01:03:22.782 --> 01:03:24.366
Forgive me.

01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:36.336
You were the soul of integrity.

01:03:39.048 --> 01:03:42.175
How did we produce such a little beast?

01:03:44.971 --> 01:03:48.056
I promise. I promise.

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:53.311
I promise you that
I'll know better next time.

01:03:54.522 --> 01:03:58.608
Next time it's going to be somebody
you'll be very proud of.

01:03:58.860 --> 01:03:59.943
Harold.

01:04:08.494 --> 01:04:10.120
Charlotte!

01:04:10.747 --> 01:04:15.125
Those notes you found were fragments
of a novel that I'm writing.

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:24.509
Your name, and Lolita's,
were put in by mere chance...

01:04:24.677 --> 01:04:27.512
...just because they were handy.

01:04:32.769 --> 01:04:35.187
That's the way novelists work.

01:04:35.354 --> 01:04:37.939
They think of the names of their friends...

01:04:38.107 --> 01:04:43.069
...and the people who enter
into their daily life...

01:04:43.237 --> 01:04:45.238
...like the Farlows...

01:04:46.157 --> 01:04:48.784
...and they think up funny situations.

01:04:51.287 --> 01:04:53.038
I'm making a martini for you.

01:05:03.591 --> 01:05:05.467
Uh, Charlotte!

01:05:05.718 --> 01:05:07.052
I'll take it!

01:05:09.931 --> 01:05:11.306
Yes?

01:05:11.474 --> 01:05:12.891
Yes, this is he.

01:05:13.684 --> 01:05:14.893
Yes.

01:05:16.646 --> 01:05:17.938
What?

01:05:20.107 --> 01:05:22.526
But my wife is upstairs in her bedroom.

01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:26.655
Is this a gag? Is this one of the fellows
at the country club?

01:05:26.989 --> 01:05:28.573
Just hold on, please.

01:05:29.242 --> 01:05:30.742
Charlotte!

01:05:30.910 --> 01:05:33.453
There's a man on the line
who says that you've been hit by a car!

01:05:34.831 --> 01:05:36.456
Now, listen, please, my friend--

01:05:36.624 --> 01:05:38.500
Just hold on one moment.

01:06:03.359 --> 01:06:04.985
The ambulance is here.

01:06:05.695 --> 01:06:07.612
Now, you take it easy, okay?

01:06:07.864 --> 01:06:08.989
All right?

01:06:09.824 --> 01:06:12.909
Mr. Humbert, she just ran
right in front of me!

01:06:13.119 --> 01:06:16.496
I swerved around, you see,
to avoid hitting the dog...

01:06:16.664 --> 01:06:18.957
...and she just ran right in front of me.

01:06:19.125 --> 01:06:21.793
My dad's in a state of shock,
I gotta look after him...

01:06:21.961 --> 01:06:24.921
...but I just wanted you to know
it isn't my fault.

01:06:25.214 --> 01:06:27.299
Are you the lady's husband?

01:06:28.301 --> 01:06:31.678
- Uh, yes.
- I'm afraid she's dead.

01:06:48.404 --> 01:06:49.613
Humbert?

01:06:50.823 --> 01:06:52.324
Humbert?

01:06:53.242 --> 01:06:54.910
It's Jean and John.

01:06:59.123 --> 01:07:00.332
Hum?

01:07:02.501 --> 01:07:04.377
Humbert, where are you?

01:07:06.505 --> 01:07:07.964
Oh.

01:07:09.050 --> 01:07:11.426
It's all right. Come in, both of you.

01:07:11.802 --> 01:07:15.055
- Jean, I'm perfectly decent.
- Are you sure it's all right?

01:07:15.222 --> 01:07:16.806
Look, there's a stool.

01:07:17.141 --> 01:07:18.934
Sit down on the stool.

01:07:19.644 --> 01:07:20.977
You poor man.

01:07:21.145 --> 01:07:22.687
Just have to hang on, Hum.

01:07:23.689 --> 01:07:25.190
She was....

01:07:25.900 --> 01:07:29.277
She was a wonderful person, Humbert.

01:07:30.571 --> 01:07:32.572
She was always so gay,
wasn't she, John?

01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:36.201
Just remember, I mean,
it's always darkest before the dawn.

01:07:36.369 --> 01:07:39.245
That's very, very true.

01:07:39.872 --> 01:07:43.208
It's just wonderful to have friends
at a time like--

01:07:44.835 --> 01:07:46.378
I'm so, so sorry.

01:07:48.381 --> 01:07:50.131
Now, see here, old man...

01:07:53.302 --> 01:07:55.470
...you mustn't think
of doing anything rash.

01:07:55.638 --> 01:07:57.263
Why, of course not.

01:07:58.391 --> 01:08:00.642
You have everything to live for,
hasn't he?

01:08:00.810 --> 01:08:03.728
Perhaps you'd better tell him
about Charlotte's kidney.

01:08:03.896 --> 01:08:05.230
Oh, yes.

01:08:05.398 --> 01:08:08.984
Humbert, Charlotte didn't want
anybody to know this...

01:08:09.402 --> 01:08:11.236
...but she hadn't long to live anyhow.

01:08:11.404 --> 01:08:12.904
She only had one kidney.

01:08:13.072 --> 01:08:14.864
- Born that way.
- Yes, that's right.

01:08:15.032 --> 01:08:18.660
And the one kidney she had
was distressed.

01:08:18.828 --> 01:08:19.868
She had...

01:08:20.037 --> 01:08:21.746
- Nephritis.
- ...nephritis.

01:08:22.081 --> 01:08:23.415
Char.... Oh....

01:08:25.542 --> 01:08:26.751
I'll get it.

01:08:27.044 --> 01:08:28.420
Humbert.

01:08:28.921 --> 01:08:32.465
Try to think of your poor little Lolita,
all alone in the world.

01:08:32.633 --> 01:08:34.718
You must live for her sake.

01:08:36.345 --> 01:08:40.432
- Oh, uh, excuse me.
- That's all right. Come in, please.

01:08:40.599 --> 01:08:43.518
I'm Frederick Beale, Sr.
May I talk to you for a moment?

01:08:43.685 --> 01:08:44.810
Do, please.

01:08:44.979 --> 01:08:46.645
My son was driving the car.

01:08:46.814 --> 01:08:49.314
- When that thing happened.
- Yes.

01:08:49.524 --> 01:08:53.278
My two youngest, Jack and Mary,
are in the same grade as your Lolita.

01:08:53.446 --> 01:08:55.196
He's had a terrible shock.

01:08:55.363 --> 01:08:57.573
Yes, of course he has.

01:08:57.742 --> 01:09:00.702
You know, this isn't easy
to talk about...

01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:04.663
...but technically it was the pedestrian's
fault and not the driver's.

01:09:04.915 --> 01:09:07.207
Technically, you're absolutely right.

01:09:07.376 --> 01:09:10.295
You see, it was raining
and she ran across the road.

01:09:10.462 --> 01:09:14.591
You don't have to explain to me
because I have no quarrel with you.

01:09:14.966 --> 01:09:19.054
Well, I must say
you're wonderfully sympathetic.

01:09:19.388 --> 01:09:22.140
In fact, you've been so generous
about the whole matter...

01:09:22.308 --> 01:09:25.310
...I was about to suggest that
maybe you'd allow me to pay...

01:09:25.478 --> 01:09:26.810
...the funeral expenses.

01:09:26.979 --> 01:09:29.354
That's awfully nice of you.

01:09:30.066 --> 01:09:31.608
Thank you very much.

01:09:32.818 --> 01:09:35.487
Well, that's the least I can do.

01:09:36.447 --> 01:09:37.863
It's my pleasure.

01:09:38.157 --> 01:09:40.366
Well, I won't keep you any longer.

01:09:40.576 --> 01:09:43.828
We'll have to get together very soon
and sort out the details.

01:09:43.996 --> 01:09:46.497
Yes, let's do that. Yes.

01:10:32.461 --> 01:10:33.837
Do you work here?

01:10:34.004 --> 01:10:35.380
Yeah, sort of.

01:10:36.173 --> 01:10:38.633
- I didn't think you were a camper.
- No.

01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:42.428
This is a girls' camp exclusively,
isn't it?

01:10:42.596 --> 01:10:43.596
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:43.764 --> 01:10:45.890
I'm Charlie, Mrs. Sedgwick's son.

01:10:46.392 --> 01:10:50.270
Oh. You visit the place, I suppose,
from time to time?

01:10:50.437 --> 01:10:51.771
No, I live here.

01:10:53.315 --> 01:10:56.693
Are you the only boy living in the camp?

01:10:56.861 --> 01:10:58.236
The only one.

01:11:01.031 --> 01:11:03.199
Do you know a girl called Lolita?

01:11:03.784 --> 01:11:04.909
Dolores Haze?

01:11:05.077 --> 01:11:06.786
Yeah, yeah, I know her.

01:11:07.079 --> 01:11:08.079
Well?

01:11:08.247 --> 01:11:10.790
Well, I see her around once in a while.
Hi, Ma.

01:11:10.958 --> 01:11:14.502
What are those sheets doing there?
You know they belong in the laundry room.

01:11:14.670 --> 01:11:17.839
She's almost packed, Dr. Humbert.
We haven't told her anything.

01:11:18.007 --> 01:11:20.425
- Thank you.
- Poor man. Terrible thing.

01:11:21.302 --> 01:11:24.929
Okay, what's the big mystery bit?
Why did those girls look at me so funny?

01:11:25.264 --> 01:11:26.389
There's no mystery.

01:11:26.557 --> 01:11:30.685
It's just that I didn't want to talk
in front of your friends at the camp.

01:11:30.895 --> 01:11:32.520
It's your mother.

01:11:34.148 --> 01:11:37.901
Really? She giving me time off
for good behavior or something?

01:11:38.068 --> 01:11:40.695
No, she hasn't been feeling very well.

01:11:41.864 --> 01:11:43.990
What's the matter with her?

01:11:44.241 --> 01:11:45.366
She's sick.

01:11:45.534 --> 01:11:48.286
- Really, what is it?
- The doctors don't seem to know...

01:11:48.454 --> 01:11:50.038
...quite what the trouble is.

01:11:50.206 --> 01:11:53.208
She's been moved to a hospital
in the country, near Lepingsville.

01:11:53.792 --> 01:11:57.629
A hospital! Well, is that where
we're going now, is Lepingsville?

01:11:58.047 --> 01:12:00.048
Uh, yes, eventually...

01:12:00.216 --> 01:12:02.842
...and then you and I will
have to bide our time...

01:12:03.010 --> 01:12:05.011
...until your mother gets well.

01:12:05.179 --> 01:12:08.139
After that, I thought we might go
to the mountains for a while.

01:12:08.307 --> 01:12:10.016
Does that appeal to you?

01:12:11.435 --> 01:12:13.728
What's the routine,
are we going home now or what?

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:17.941
No, dear. We should be in Briceland
by dinnertime and I've no doubt that...

01:12:18.108 --> 01:12:21.903
...we shall find some comfortable hotel
to spend the night...

01:12:22.071 --> 01:12:26.074
...and then tomorrow morning
we'll press on towards Lepingsville.

01:12:29.078 --> 01:12:31.496
Did you have a marvelous summer?

01:12:32.998 --> 01:12:34.415
Yeah, I guess so.

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:36.292
Were you sorry to leave?

01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:37.794
Not exactly.

01:12:49.598 --> 01:12:51.808
You know, I've missed you terribly.

01:12:52.893 --> 01:12:56.688
I haven't missed you. In fact,
I've been revoltingly unfaithful to you.

01:12:56.981 --> 01:12:58.022
Oh?

01:12:58.190 --> 01:13:01.567
But it doesn't matter a bit,
because you've stopped caring anyway.

01:13:02.361 --> 01:13:05.113
What makes you say
I've stopped caring for you?

01:13:06.490 --> 01:13:08.533
You haven't even kissed me yet,
have you?

01:13:21.130 --> 01:13:22.463
Hello, Mr. Swine.

01:13:22.631 --> 01:13:26.509
Hello, Mr. Quilty. Good evening, ma'am.
Did you get any good pictures today?

01:13:26.677 --> 01:13:28.845
Yeah, great.
I'm having a swell vacation.

01:13:29.179 --> 01:13:30.221
Good.

01:13:30.389 --> 01:13:33.641
Mr. Swine, would you mind
if I asked you a personal question?

01:13:33.809 --> 01:13:35.268
Sure, go ahead.

01:13:35.477 --> 01:13:38.813
What is a guy like you
doing in a job like this?

01:13:38.981 --> 01:13:40.523
What do you mean?

01:13:40.691 --> 01:13:42.900
Well, you just
don't seem to be the type.

01:13:44.778 --> 01:13:47.697
Well, as a matter of fact,
I was an actor.

01:13:47.865 --> 01:13:49.699
I knew it. Didn't I say to you?

01:13:49.867 --> 01:13:51.409
When I first saw you, you had...

01:13:51.577 --> 01:13:54.203
...a sort of aura that all actors
and actresses have.

01:13:54.371 --> 01:13:59.125
Well, since you're a playwright, uh,
maybe you could use me sometime.

01:13:59.418 --> 01:14:02.587
Yeah, maybe I could use you sometime.

01:14:02.755 --> 01:14:04.172
Mr. Swine...

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.549
...what does an actor-manager...

01:14:06.717 --> 01:14:09.719
...do with his spare time
in a small town like this?

01:14:10.095 --> 01:14:12.513
Well, I don't have much spare time...

01:14:12.681 --> 01:14:16.267
...but I swim, play tennis, lift weights.

01:14:16.435 --> 01:14:18.603
Gets rid of the excess energy.

01:14:18.771 --> 01:14:21.856
What do you do
with your excess energy?

01:14:22.232 --> 01:14:25.026
Well, we do a lot of things
with my excess energy.

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:27.403
One of the things we do a lot of is judo.

01:14:27.571 --> 01:14:29.739
- Did you ever hear about that?
- Judo?

01:14:29.907 --> 01:14:32.116
- Yes, I've heard about it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:14:32.284 --> 01:14:33.910
You do judo with the lady?

01:14:34.078 --> 01:14:38.289
Yes, she's a yellow belt, I'm a green belt,
that's the way nature made it.

01:14:38.457 --> 01:14:41.084
What happens is she throws me
all over the place.

01:14:41.251 --> 01:14:42.418
She throws you?

01:14:42.586 --> 01:14:46.631
What she does, she gets me in a sort
of thing called a sweeping-ankle throw.

01:14:46.799 --> 01:14:48.466
She sweeps my ankles from under me.

01:14:48.634 --> 01:14:51.135
- I go down with one hell of a bang.
- Doesn't it hurt?

01:14:51.303 --> 01:14:53.971
I lay there in pain but I love it.
I really love it.

01:14:54.139 --> 01:14:58.309
I lay hovering between consciousness
and unconsciousness. It's the greatest.

01:15:02.898 --> 01:15:04.232
Wow.

01:15:04.691 --> 01:15:05.983
This looks swank.

01:15:10.823 --> 01:15:12.490
- See you later.
- Okay.

01:15:14.326 --> 01:15:16.953
- Good evening.
- Good evening, sir. Can I help you?

01:15:17.121 --> 01:15:20.331
Yes, I'd like a room with a bath,
or, rather, two rooms with baths.

01:15:20.499 --> 01:15:22.333
Did you have a reservation, Mr...?

01:15:22.501 --> 01:15:24.836
Humbert is the name.
No, I have no reservation.

01:15:25.003 --> 01:15:27.839
Well, I'm afraid it'll be impossible
to accommodate you.

01:15:28.006 --> 01:15:29.715
This convention's got us
tied up in knots.

01:15:29.883 --> 01:15:32.051
- Oh.
- Is it just you and the girl?

01:15:32.219 --> 01:15:35.346
Yes. I would like you to accommodate us
because we're very tired.

01:15:35.514 --> 01:15:36.764
Mr. Potts.

01:15:37.141 --> 01:15:38.349
Yes, Mr. Swine?

01:15:38.517 --> 01:15:40.852
What about Captain Love?
Has he called?

01:15:41.019 --> 01:15:42.812
He's canceled his reservation.

01:15:42.980 --> 01:15:46.482
Well, I could give you 242.
Uh, it's a lovely room...

01:15:46.984 --> 01:15:49.235
...but it's only got one bed.

01:15:49.611 --> 01:15:53.573
Well, perhaps you can find a folding bed
or a camp bed.

01:15:53.782 --> 01:15:55.408
Potts, do we have any cots?

01:15:55.576 --> 01:15:57.577
No, the troopers have
snapped them all up.

01:15:57.744 --> 01:16:01.706
I'm sure you'd find one room satisfactory.
Our double beds are really triple.

01:16:01.874 --> 01:16:04.000
One night we had three ladies
sleeping in one.

01:16:04.168 --> 01:16:05.293
I'm sure we'll manage.

01:16:05.461 --> 01:16:09.046
Even if my wife joins me later,
we'll manage even then, I'm sure.

01:16:09.214 --> 01:16:12.175
- Good. Would you mind registering?
- Certainly.

01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:17.805
By the way, what sort of a convention
are you holding here?

01:16:17.973 --> 01:16:22.685
We are very proud to have the overflow
of the State Police Convention.

01:16:40.329 --> 01:16:45.249
Perhaps if you just left them on the floor
that would be all right.

01:16:47.961 --> 01:16:49.587
Oh, oh....

01:16:50.506 --> 01:16:52.548
Well, you can just....

01:16:52.716 --> 01:16:54.091
Yes, that's fine.

01:16:56.136 --> 01:16:57.637
Thank you very much.

01:16:58.472 --> 01:16:59.972
Thank you, sir.

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:07.980
Well?

01:17:08.607 --> 01:17:10.733
Is, uh, this it?

01:17:11.318 --> 01:17:12.527
You mean, uh...?

01:17:14.363 --> 01:17:15.613
Yeah.

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:18.533
Yes.

01:17:19.451 --> 01:17:24.372
But you see, I'm quite sure
that they'll manage to find a cot for us.

01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:27.416
I asked them downstairs in the lobby
to find a cot.

01:17:28.126 --> 01:17:30.461
- A cot?
- Yes.

01:17:31.088 --> 01:17:32.505
You're crazy.

01:17:32.923 --> 01:17:34.382
Why, my darling?

01:17:34.716 --> 01:17:37.969
Because, my darling,
when my darling mother finds out...

01:17:38.136 --> 01:17:41.138
...she's going to divorce you
and strangle me.

01:17:43.809 --> 01:17:45.935
Yes. Now, look, Lo.

01:17:47.479 --> 01:17:49.397
I have a great feeling of...

01:17:49.898 --> 01:17:51.857
...tenderness for you.

01:17:52.025 --> 01:17:55.820
While your mother is ill,
I'm responsible for your welfare.

01:17:56.071 --> 01:17:59.907
We're not rich, and while we travel
we shall be obliged....

01:18:00.075 --> 01:18:02.159
We shall be thrown
a good deal together.

01:18:03.078 --> 01:18:06.998
Now, two people sharing one room
inevitably enter into a kind of...

01:18:07.749 --> 01:18:10.835
...how shall I say, a kind of, um....

01:18:12.588 --> 01:18:15.506
Aren't you gonna go see about the cot?

01:18:31.565 --> 01:18:32.815
Uh....

01:18:33.859 --> 01:18:36.027
Has there been a message for me
from my wife?

01:18:36.194 --> 01:18:39.864
I'm sorry, sir, nothing yet,
but we're working on that cot.

01:18:40.115 --> 01:18:41.324
Thank you.

01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:22.406
Hello. Ha, ha. Heh. Hello.

01:19:22.949 --> 01:19:24.659
You're addressing me.

01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:26.911
I thought perhaps
there was someone with you.

01:19:27.079 --> 01:19:29.330
No, I'm not really with someone.
I'm with you. Ha, ha.

01:19:29.498 --> 01:19:31.082
I didn't mean that as an insult.

01:19:31.249 --> 01:19:34.377
What I meant was that
I'm with the state police here, and...

01:19:34.544 --> 01:19:37.838
...when I'm with them, I'm with someone,
but right now I'm on my own.

01:19:38.006 --> 01:19:40.341
I mean, I'm not with a lot of people,
just you. Heh.

01:19:40.509 --> 01:19:44.762
Well, I wouldn't like to disturb you.
I'll, uh, leave you alone if you prefer it.

01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:49.225
You don't really have to go at all.
I like it. I don't know what it is.

01:19:49.393 --> 01:19:52.603
I get the impression you want to leave
but you don't like to leave...

01:19:52.771 --> 01:19:56.899
...because you think I'd think it looks
suspicious, me being a policeman and all.

01:19:57.067 --> 01:20:00.695
You don't have to think that because
I haven't got a suspicious mind at all.

01:20:00.862 --> 01:20:05.199
A lot of people think I'm suspicious,
especially when I stand on street corners.

01:20:05.367 --> 01:20:06.951
One of our boys picked me up once.

01:20:07.119 --> 01:20:10.246
He thought that I was too suspicious
standing on the street corner.

01:20:10.414 --> 01:20:13.624
Tell me, I couldn't help noticing
when you checked in tonight--

01:20:13.792 --> 01:20:16.293
It's part of my job,
I notice human individuals...

01:20:16.461 --> 01:20:17.920
...and I noticed your face.

01:20:18.088 --> 01:20:19.755
I said to myself when I saw you...

01:20:19.923 --> 01:20:23.426
...there's a guy with the most
normal-looking face I ever saw in my life.

01:20:23.593 --> 01:20:24.844
That's very nice of you.

01:20:25.011 --> 01:20:28.222
Not a bit. It's great to see a normal face,
because I'm a normal guy.

01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:29.849
Be great for two normal guys...

01:20:30.016 --> 01:20:33.144
...to get together and talk about
world events, in a normal way.

01:20:33.311 --> 01:20:36.939
There's nothing I would like better
than that, but I don't have much time.

01:20:37.107 --> 01:20:39.650
It's a pity, because, uh, may I say
one other thing to you?

01:20:39.818 --> 01:20:41.652
I've been thinking about it a lot.

01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:45.322
I noticed when you was checking in
you had a lovely little girl with you.

01:20:45.490 --> 01:20:46.490
She was really lovely.

01:20:46.658 --> 01:20:49.744
She wasn't so little, come to think of it.
She was fairly tall....

01:20:49.911 --> 01:20:52.997
Taller than little, you know,
but, uh, she was really lovely.

01:20:53.165 --> 01:20:56.167
I wish I had a pretty, tall,
lovely little girl like that--

01:20:56.334 --> 01:20:57.501
That was my daughter.

01:20:57.669 --> 01:21:00.296
Your daughter?
Isn't it great to have a lovely, tall...

01:21:00.464 --> 01:21:03.007
...pretty little daughter like that?
It's wonderful.

01:21:03.175 --> 01:21:06.260
I don't have any children or boys
or little tall girls.

01:21:06.428 --> 01:21:07.887
I'm not even-- Are you married?

01:21:08.054 --> 01:21:10.806
Yes, I'm expecting my wife,
perhaps, to join us here.

01:21:10.974 --> 01:21:14.143
May I say something?
I thought you looked uneasy at the desk.

01:21:14.311 --> 01:21:16.896
I was thinking that you want to get away
from your wife.

01:21:17.063 --> 01:21:20.775
I don't blame you. If I was married
I'd take every opportunity to get away.

01:21:20.942 --> 01:21:23.277
Yes. No, that was not it at all.

01:21:23.445 --> 01:21:27.281
Uh, as a matter of fact, it's possible
that my wife won't join me...

01:21:27.449 --> 01:21:29.867
...because when I left home
she was not well.

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:31.911
Aw, gee. What was the matter
with your wife?

01:21:32.078 --> 01:21:34.163
It's not important. She had an accident.

01:21:34.331 --> 01:21:38.626
She had an accident! That's terrible!
Fancy a normal guy's wife having...

01:21:38.794 --> 01:21:41.504
...an accident like that!
What happened to her?

01:21:41.713 --> 01:21:43.172
She was hit by a car.

01:21:43.340 --> 01:21:46.675
Gee, no wonder she's not here.
You must feel pretty bad about that.

01:21:46.843 --> 01:21:50.221
What's happening?
Is she coming later, or something?

01:21:50.388 --> 01:21:52.431
Well, that was the understanding.

01:21:52.599 --> 01:21:55.935
What, in an ambulance? Ha, ha.
Gee, I'm sorry I-- I shouldn't say that.

01:21:56.102 --> 01:21:58.521
I get sort of carried away,
being so normal and all.

01:21:58.688 --> 01:22:01.732
When you were at the desk
checking in with the night manager...

01:22:01.900 --> 01:22:04.944
...Mr. George Swine, who I happen
to know as a personal friend...

01:22:05.111 --> 01:22:08.322
...I was wondering if he fixed you up
with a good accommodation here.

01:22:08.490 --> 01:22:10.241
Yes, they were extremely cooperative.

01:22:10.408 --> 01:22:13.369
You sure? Because I could easily
have a word with George Swine.

01:22:13.537 --> 01:22:15.621
He's a really normal,
nice sort of guy...

01:22:15.789 --> 01:22:18.082
...and I've only got to have
a word in his ear...

01:22:18.250 --> 01:22:20.709
...and you'd be surprised
what things could happen.

01:22:20.877 --> 01:22:24.213
He'd probably turn some troopers out,
so you could have a lovely room...

01:22:24.381 --> 01:22:26.590
...a bridal suite,
for you and your lovely girl.

01:22:26.758 --> 01:22:29.093
I don't want you to take any trouble
on my account.

01:22:29.261 --> 01:22:30.594
We're perfectly comfortable.

01:22:30.762 --> 01:22:33.430
It's his job to fix you up
with something nice.

01:22:33.598 --> 01:22:35.432
He gets paid for doing that thing...

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:37.893
...and when he sees a guy like you,
all normal...

01:22:38.061 --> 01:22:40.271
...with a lovely girl,
he should say to himself:

01:22:40.438 --> 01:22:44.233
"I gotta give that guy a lovely sort of
comfortable, foamy bed to sleep in."

01:22:44.401 --> 01:22:48.445
I don't like to hear things like that,
because I could go take a swipe at him...

01:22:48.613 --> 01:22:52.074
...for not giving you a lovely, comfortable,
sleepy, movie-star bed.

01:22:52.242 --> 01:22:53.701
You know what I mean? Heh.

01:22:53.869 --> 01:22:56.495
I mean, what has he got you on,
the floor or something?

01:22:56.663 --> 01:23:00.708
Well, the little girl is probably asleep
already in the bed and....

01:23:00.959 --> 01:23:04.628
- I don't know why we're discussing this.
- Why don't you let me have a look...

01:23:04.796 --> 01:23:08.132
...at the accommodation that you have,
and take it in for a second...

01:23:08.300 --> 01:23:11.385
...then I can have a word with
George Swine? It would be simple.

01:23:11.553 --> 01:23:14.013
No, you really shouldn't worry
about either of us.

01:23:14.180 --> 01:23:16.223
Which reminds me,
I should go upstairs now.

01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:18.225
You're going because you think that...

01:23:18.393 --> 01:23:21.562
...me being a policeman,
I'd think you were sort of suspicious?

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:24.481
I don't think that at all.
I think you're really normal.

01:23:24.649 --> 01:23:28.652
- You don't have to go because of that.
- No. It's been very nice talking to you.

01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:32.281
Before you go, I was wondering whether
maybe in the morning, you know...

01:23:32.449 --> 01:23:35.910
- ...me being lonely and normal--
- We have to get up at the crack of dawn.

01:23:36.077 --> 01:23:38.287
- We can have breakfast.
- That's very nice, but--

01:23:38.455 --> 01:23:41.332
I can arrange it with George Swine.
He could have it laid out.

01:23:41.499 --> 01:23:43.667
Well, thank you so much. Good night.

01:23:44.085 --> 01:23:46.712
You have a most interesting face.
Good night.

01:23:50.508 --> 01:23:51.634
Excuse me.

01:23:52.552 --> 01:23:54.970
Hush. Hush. Shh, shh, shh. She's asleep.

01:23:55.138 --> 01:23:56.847
Good evening. I brought the cot, sir.

01:23:57.015 --> 01:23:58.515
Yes, I see you did.

01:23:59.392 --> 01:24:01.185
We don't need it now, so take it away.

01:24:01.353 --> 01:24:03.354
- You don't need the cot?
- No, she's asleep.

01:24:03.521 --> 01:24:05.940
- I won't make any noise.
- That's not the point.

01:24:06.107 --> 01:24:09.777
Two of the troopers agreed to double up.
That's how I got the cot, sir.

01:24:09.945 --> 01:24:12.321
Well, in that case,
all right, bring it in.

01:24:12.489 --> 01:24:15.324
But no noise, please. Quietly.

01:25:59.054 --> 01:26:01.138
- We did it, sir.
- Shh!

01:26:17.822 --> 01:26:19.323
Thank you, sir.

01:27:18.174 --> 01:27:19.216
Hello.

01:27:22.846 --> 01:27:24.221
The cot came.

01:27:26.141 --> 01:27:27.266
Yes.

01:27:29.227 --> 01:27:30.435
Well...

01:27:31.479 --> 01:27:32.896
...good night.

01:28:44.260 --> 01:28:46.178
Wake up, Humbert, the hotel's on fire!

01:28:48.223 --> 01:28:49.640
The hotel's on fire, quick!

01:28:49.807 --> 01:28:51.308
What, what, what? On fire?

01:28:51.476 --> 01:28:52.893
Get out of bed real quick!

01:28:53.061 --> 01:28:55.562
- Quick, it's burning down to the ground!
- Lolita.

01:28:57.899 --> 01:29:01.360
Why did you have to wake me?
I only just got to sleep.

01:29:03.988 --> 01:29:04.988
Very funny.

01:29:05.156 --> 01:29:08.659
By the way, what happened to your bed?
It looks a lot lower.

01:29:08.868 --> 01:29:13.163
Well, the bed collapsed.
It's a collapsible bed.

01:29:19.045 --> 01:29:20.587
What time is it?

01:29:22.423 --> 01:29:25.259
- It's breakfast time.
- Mm.

01:29:25.969 --> 01:29:28.512
You know, my tan is much darker
than yours now.

01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:30.514
That's not strictly true.

01:29:30.765 --> 01:29:33.267
You're a very fair-skinned lady.

01:29:34.686 --> 01:29:36.019
Ah.

01:29:36.729 --> 01:29:38.605
Look at that. That's very interesting.

01:29:38.773 --> 01:29:39.773
Yeah.

01:29:39.941 --> 01:29:41.650
What else can you do?

01:29:41.818 --> 01:29:45.779
Well, this little thumb can go
all the way back to my wrist, see?

01:29:46.281 --> 01:29:48.907
Yes, I can see. You're very talented.

01:29:50.159 --> 01:29:52.035
Boy, you need a shave.

01:29:52.412 --> 01:29:56.123
Of course I need a shave, because
I've not shaved since yesterday morning...

01:29:56.291 --> 01:29:58.458
...and I'm a man who needs, uh...

01:29:58.626 --> 01:30:00.919
- ...two shaves a day.
- Mm.

01:30:01.087 --> 01:30:02.963
Do you always have to shave
twice a day?

01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:04.756
Yes, of course...

01:30:05.633 --> 01:30:08.468
...because all the best people
shave twice a day.

01:30:13.725 --> 01:30:15.517
Well, what shall we do now?

01:30:17.353 --> 01:30:19.813
You ring down and order breakfast.

01:30:20.523 --> 01:30:22.399
No, I don't wanna do that.

01:30:22.567 --> 01:30:24.484
Well, what do you want to do?

01:30:27.113 --> 01:30:28.864
Why don't we play a game?

01:30:29.324 --> 01:30:31.491
A game? Come on.

01:30:31.743 --> 01:30:34.244
No, you get on to room service at once.

01:30:34.495 --> 01:30:35.579
No, really.

01:30:35.747 --> 01:30:39.750
I learned some real good games in camp.

01:30:40.209 --> 01:30:42.586
One in particularly was fun.

01:30:43.004 --> 01:30:48.342
Well, why don't you describe this one
in particularly good game.

01:30:48.509 --> 01:30:50.552
Well, I played it with Charlie.

01:30:52.305 --> 01:30:53.805
Charlie? Who's he?

01:30:55.183 --> 01:30:56.183
Charlie?

01:30:56.684 --> 01:30:59.227
He's that guy that you met in the office.

01:31:00.021 --> 01:31:02.230
- You mean that boy?
- Mm-hm.

01:31:02.398 --> 01:31:03.732
You and he?

01:31:04.525 --> 01:31:05.859
Yeah.

01:31:07.945 --> 01:31:11.239
Are you sure you can't guess what game
I'm talking about?

01:31:13.076 --> 01:31:15.535
Uh, I'm not a very good guesser.

01:31:18.539 --> 01:31:21.792
Well, it's not tiddlywinks
and it's not Russian roulette....

01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:30.300
I don't know what game you played.

01:31:31.135 --> 01:31:32.219
You have to....

01:31:36.265 --> 01:31:39.559
You mean, you never played that game
when you were a kid?

01:31:40.353 --> 01:31:41.478
No.

01:31:42.897 --> 01:31:44.272
Alrighty then.

01:32:10.466 --> 01:32:12.634
Have you ever kissed the Blarney Stone?

01:32:12.802 --> 01:32:15.137
No, that's something I never did.

01:32:15.346 --> 01:32:17.264
Boy, I sure wish I could.

01:32:17.432 --> 01:32:20.684
Well, perhaps sometime
we can organize a trip.

01:32:20.852 --> 01:32:22.310
Hmm.

01:32:25.481 --> 01:32:27.524
Hey, let's tell Mother.

01:32:27.692 --> 01:32:29.317
Tell Mother what?

01:32:29.485 --> 01:32:30.819
You know what.

01:32:31.863 --> 01:32:33.780
No, I don't think that
would be very funny.

01:32:33.948 --> 01:32:36.700
Ha, ha. I wonder what she'd do.

01:32:38.786 --> 01:32:43.623
If you don't stop eating those chips
you won't have any appetite for your lunch.

01:32:46.752 --> 01:32:49.212
Ooh, did you see that? A squashed cat.

01:32:50.173 --> 01:32:51.840
Boy, that's terrible.

01:32:52.008 --> 01:32:53.967
I hate things like that.

01:32:55.219 --> 01:32:56.553
Mm.

01:32:58.848 --> 01:33:00.640
You know what I'd like for lunch?

01:33:00.808 --> 01:33:02.142
No, tell me.

01:33:02.393 --> 01:33:05.395
A big plate of french fries and a malt.

01:33:05.646 --> 01:33:07.022
Oh.

01:33:15.990 --> 01:33:18.492
How long until we get to Lepingsville?

01:33:18.659 --> 01:33:23.079
Well, I'm beginning to think that
perhaps we won't make it this evening.

01:33:23.247 --> 01:33:25.332
We got off to rather a slow start,
remember?

01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:28.502
Mm. Can we go to a movie tonight?

01:33:28.669 --> 01:33:30.587
If that's what you'd like.

01:33:30.755 --> 01:33:32.088
I would.

01:33:33.382 --> 01:33:38.595
Have you ever seen any of those--
You know, those, um, foreign films?

01:33:39.055 --> 01:33:40.555
Yes, frequently.

01:33:41.140 --> 01:33:43.266
- I don't like them.
- Oh?

01:33:43.434 --> 01:33:44.976
Mm-mm.

01:33:48.231 --> 01:33:50.732
Will you stop at the next gas station?

01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:52.234
All right.

01:33:54.612 --> 01:33:56.905
- You're feeling all right, aren't you?
- Mm-hm.

01:33:57.073 --> 01:34:00.325
I feel fine.
I want to call Mother at that hospital.

01:34:00.535 --> 01:34:02.202
What's the number?

01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:09.251
Well, don't you know the number?

01:34:11.295 --> 01:34:15.715
I think it will be just as well if you wait
until we get to Lepingsville.

01:34:15.883 --> 01:34:18.802
Why? What difference does it make?
I wanna call her.

01:34:18.970 --> 01:34:21.471
I just don't think it'd be
a very good idea.

01:34:21.639 --> 01:34:24.224
Why can't I call my mother if I want to?

01:34:25.268 --> 01:34:26.935
Because you can't.

01:34:27.144 --> 01:34:28.353
Why?

01:34:32.275 --> 01:34:33.608
Because...

01:34:35.778 --> 01:34:37.112
...your mother is dead.

01:34:43.327 --> 01:34:46.580
Come on now, cut it out.
Why can't I call her?

01:34:47.039 --> 01:34:48.790
Your mother is dead.

01:36:01.530 --> 01:36:03.281
Try to stop crying.

01:36:05.368 --> 01:36:06.993
Everything's going to be all right.

01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:09.704
Nothing will ever be all right.

01:36:14.418 --> 01:36:17.837
I'm sure that we're going to be very happy,
you and I.

01:36:18.798 --> 01:36:21.383
But everything has changed
all of a sudden.

01:36:21.676 --> 01:36:25.595
Everything was so, I don't know, normal.

01:36:26.972 --> 01:36:29.349
Lolita, please, please don't cry.

01:36:31.477 --> 01:36:33.978
We'll do things. We'll go places.

01:36:34.146 --> 01:36:36.648
But there's no place to go back to.

01:36:38.192 --> 01:36:39.401
We'll find a new home.

01:36:39.568 --> 01:36:40.777
Where?

01:36:43.322 --> 01:36:44.823
Beardsley.

01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:47.242
- Beardsley?
- My lectureship starts in September.

01:36:47.410 --> 01:36:49.703
It's in Ohio. You'll like it there.

01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:51.955
I'll hate it. I know I will.

01:36:52.206 --> 01:36:54.833
No, you won't. It's a wonderful place.

01:36:56.752 --> 01:36:59.462
But what about all my things
back in Ramsdale?

01:36:59.630 --> 01:37:00.797
And the house?

01:37:00.965 --> 01:37:02.841
We'll take care of all those things.

01:37:03.008 --> 01:37:05.385
What things do you want specially?

01:37:05.886 --> 01:37:09.472
My record player and my records.

01:37:10.433 --> 01:37:14.978
We'll send for them, but in the meantime,
I can buy you new ones...

01:37:15.146 --> 01:37:16.980
...to take the place of the old ones.

01:37:17.148 --> 01:37:22.569
I'll buy you the best hi-fi set
that you ever saw and all the new records.

01:37:23.404 --> 01:37:24.863
There, there.

01:37:25.698 --> 01:37:27.991
We can't stay in Beardsley forever.

01:37:28.868 --> 01:37:30.827
Where's that handkerchief?

01:37:32.121 --> 01:37:33.496
Here.

01:37:37.585 --> 01:37:39.127
Promise me something?

01:37:39.295 --> 01:37:40.670
Yes, anything.

01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:47.635
Promise you'll never leave me.
I don't want to ever be...

01:37:47.803 --> 01:37:51.181
...in one of those horrible places
for juvenile delinquents.

01:37:51.348 --> 01:37:53.975
Whatever makes you think that
that would happen to you?

01:37:54.143 --> 01:37:55.685
I know it would...

01:37:55.853 --> 01:37:57.896
...and anyway, I'd rather be with you.

01:37:58.063 --> 01:38:00.774
You're a lot better
than one of those places.

01:38:02.651 --> 01:38:04.778
You will promise, won't you?

01:38:05.154 --> 01:38:06.654
Yes, I promise.

01:38:07.072 --> 01:38:09.449
Cross your heart and hope to die?

01:38:10.910 --> 01:38:13.203
Cross my heart and hope to die.

01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:20.043
Cross my heart and hope to die.

01:38:24.715 --> 01:38:27.008
Cross my heart and hope to die.

01:38:33.390 --> 01:38:37.393
You must now forget Ramsdale
and poor Charlotte and poor Lolita...

01:38:37.978 --> 01:38:41.439
...and poor Humbert, and accompany us
to Beardsley College...

01:38:41.607 --> 01:38:45.693
...where my lectureship in French poetry
is in its second semester.

01:38:45.945 --> 01:38:49.405
Six months have passed and Lolita
is attending an excellent school...

01:38:49.573 --> 01:38:51.699
...where I hope that
she will be persuaded...

01:38:51.867 --> 01:38:55.537
...to read other things than comic books
and movie romances.

01:39:08.926 --> 01:39:12.929
Why were you so late coming home
from school yesterday afternoon?

01:39:13.597 --> 01:39:16.099
Yesterday? Yesterday?
What was yesterday?

01:39:16.267 --> 01:39:18.059
Yesterday was Thursday.

01:39:18.227 --> 01:39:20.061
Oh, well, uh.... Was I late?

01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:21.729
Yes, you were.

01:39:22.064 --> 01:39:25.900
You finished school at 3:00.
You were not home until 6:00.

01:39:27.194 --> 01:39:29.737
That's right, that's right.
Michele and I...

01:39:29.905 --> 01:39:32.115
...um, stayed to watch football practice.

01:39:32.283 --> 01:39:34.033
In the Frigid Queen?

01:39:34.451 --> 01:39:36.369
What do you mean, in the Frigid Queen?

01:39:36.537 --> 01:39:40.874
I was driving around and I thought
I saw you through the window.

01:39:41.166 --> 01:39:45.253
Oh. Yeah, well, we stopped there
for a malt afterwards.

01:39:45.421 --> 01:39:47.088
What difference does it make?

01:39:47.256 --> 01:39:50.049
You were sitting at a table
with two boys.

01:39:51.677 --> 01:39:54.137
Roy and Rex just happened
to sit down with us.

01:39:54.305 --> 01:39:55.597
Roy and Rex?

01:39:56.098 --> 01:39:58.433
The co-captains of the football team.

01:39:58.601 --> 01:40:00.810
I thought we understood, no dates.

01:40:00.978 --> 01:40:04.105
What do you mean, no dates?
They just sat down at our table.

01:40:04.273 --> 01:40:07.317
I don't want you around them.
They're nasty-minded boys.

01:40:07.484 --> 01:40:10.778
Ho, ho. You're a fine one to talk
about someone else's mind.

01:40:11.155 --> 01:40:14.657
Don't avoid the issue.
I told you no dates.

01:40:15.075 --> 01:40:17.577
- It wasn't a date.
- It was a date.

01:40:17.953 --> 01:40:19.996
- It wasn't a date.
- It was a date, Lolita.

01:40:20.164 --> 01:40:21.831
- It was not a date.
- It was a date.

01:40:22.917 --> 01:40:24.167
It wasn't a date.

01:40:24.335 --> 01:40:27.795
Whatever it was you had yesterday,
I don't want you to have it again.

01:40:27.963 --> 01:40:29.297
While we're on the subject...

01:40:29.465 --> 01:40:32.008
...how did you come to be so late
on Saturday afternoon?

01:40:32.176 --> 01:40:33.843
Saturday I went to my piano lesson.

01:40:34.011 --> 01:40:36.638
Your piano lesson?
I thought that was on Wednesday.

01:40:36.805 --> 01:40:39.015
No, it was changed to Saturday,
remember?

01:40:39.183 --> 01:40:41.726
Between 2 and 4, Miss Starch, piano.

01:40:42.144 --> 01:40:44.270
Ask Michele. She was with me.

01:40:44.438 --> 01:40:46.356
"Ask Michele,"
that's what you always say.

01:40:46.523 --> 01:40:50.026
Well, now for a change, I'm going
to ask you something about Michele.

01:40:50.194 --> 01:40:53.446
Heh, heh. You can't have her.
She belongs to a Marine.

01:40:53.614 --> 01:40:56.282
I will ignore that idiotic joke.

01:40:57.159 --> 01:41:01.120
Why does she give me searching looks
whenever she comes to the house?

01:41:01.288 --> 01:41:02.664
How should I know?

01:41:02.831 --> 01:41:04.832
Have you told her anything about us?

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.668
No, have you?

01:41:06.835 --> 01:41:09.754
- You've told her nothing?
- Do you think I'm crazy?

01:41:10.422 --> 01:41:14.717
You spend too much time with that girl.
I don't want you to see her so often.

01:41:14.885 --> 01:41:19.430
Come on, she's the only friend I've got
in this stinking world.

01:41:19.765 --> 01:41:21.766
You never let me have any fun.

01:41:22.184 --> 01:41:27.063
No fun? You have all the fun in the world.
We have fun together, don't we?

01:41:27.231 --> 01:41:30.024
Whenever you want something
I buy it for you automatically.

01:41:30.192 --> 01:41:32.694
I take you to concerts,
to museums, to movies.

01:41:32.861 --> 01:41:34.112
I do all the housework.

01:41:34.279 --> 01:41:36.656
Who does the tidying up? I do.

01:41:36.824 --> 01:41:38.741
Who does the cooking? I do.

01:41:38.909 --> 01:41:42.662
You and I, we have lots of fun,
don't we, Lolita?

01:41:46.166 --> 01:41:47.542
Come here.

01:42:03.183 --> 01:42:04.600
Still love me?

01:42:06.729 --> 01:42:09.355
Completely. You know that.

01:42:10.190 --> 01:42:13.484
You know what I want more
than anything else in the world?

01:42:13.652 --> 01:42:15.528
No. What do you want?

01:42:16.530 --> 01:42:18.740
I want you to be proud of me.

01:42:19.074 --> 01:42:21.284
But I am proud of you, Lolita.

01:42:22.202 --> 01:42:24.203
No, I mean really proud of me.

01:42:24.371 --> 01:42:26.789
They want me for the lead
in the school play.

01:42:26.957 --> 01:42:28.541
Isn’t that fantastic?

01:42:28.792 --> 01:42:31.502
I have to have a letter from you,
giving your permission.

01:42:31.670 --> 01:42:32.712
Who wants you?

01:42:33.630 --> 01:42:37.842
Well, Edusa Gold, the drama teacher,
Clare Quilty and Vivian Darkbloom.

01:42:38.010 --> 01:42:39.093
And who might they be?

01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:42.096
The authors. They're here
to supervise the production.

01:42:42.264 --> 01:42:43.765
But you've never acted before.

01:42:43.932 --> 01:42:45.933
They say I have a unique and rare talent.

01:42:46.101 --> 01:42:47.477
And how do they know that?

01:42:47.644 --> 01:42:50.480
We had readings and I was chosen
over 30 other girls.

01:42:50.647 --> 01:42:52.815
That's the first I've heard about it.

01:42:52.983 --> 01:42:55.318
I know, I wanted to surprise you.

01:42:55.486 --> 01:42:58.488
And I suppose that Roy has a part
in this production?

01:42:58.655 --> 01:43:00.323
Roy? What's he got to do with this?

01:43:00.491 --> 01:43:03.659
Roy and Rex, naturally,
I suppose they're in it.

01:43:03.827 --> 01:43:06.162
Well, how do I know?
I only met them yesterday.

01:43:06.330 --> 01:43:08.498
Besides, they're football players,
not actors.

01:43:08.665 --> 01:43:12.835
And you suddenly, overnight,
are an actress. It's out of the question.

01:43:13.003 --> 01:43:15.755
- Out of the question?
- I don't want you in that atmosphere.

01:43:15.923 --> 01:43:17.673
What atmosphere? It's a school play!

01:43:17.841 --> 01:43:20.510
I've told you, I don't want you mixing
with those boys.

01:43:20.677 --> 01:43:25.223
It's just another excuse to make dates
with them, and to get close with them.

01:43:25.390 --> 01:43:27.642
- You don't love me.
- I do love you.

01:43:27.810 --> 01:43:30.311
- You don't love me.
- I do love you, Lolita.

01:43:30.479 --> 01:43:33.189
You're driving me crazy.
You won't let me do anything.

01:43:33.357 --> 01:43:36.484
You just want to keep me
locked up with you in this filthy house.

01:43:36.652 --> 01:43:40.363
Now, dear, go and wash your face.
I'll go downstairs and start the roast.

01:43:40.531 --> 01:43:42.198
- You'll regret this.
- Wash your face.

01:43:42.366 --> 01:43:45.993
- I'll go downstairs and start the roast.
- You'll be sorry you won't--

01:43:46.161 --> 01:43:48.162
And don't smudge your toenails.

01:44:07.599 --> 01:44:08.891
Lo?

01:44:10.853 --> 01:44:12.145
Lo?

01:44:14.982 --> 01:44:17.400
Good evening, Dr. Humbert.

01:44:19.987 --> 01:44:21.362
Oh.

01:44:21.947 --> 01:44:23.281
Who are you?

01:44:23.866 --> 01:44:25.575
I am Dr. Zemph.

01:44:26.535 --> 01:44:28.911
Dr. Humbert, I am pleased to meet you.

01:44:29.329 --> 01:44:32.331
I am the Beardsley High School
psychologist.

01:44:32.499 --> 01:44:35.501
Have you been here...? Uh....
I mean, how did you get in?

01:44:35.711 --> 01:44:38.421
Well, your little daughter opened
the door to me...

01:44:38.589 --> 01:44:40.381
...on the way to her piano lesson...

01:44:40.549 --> 01:44:43.926
...and she said I was to wait in here
until your arrival.

01:44:44.094 --> 01:44:45.511
And so here I am.

01:44:45.679 --> 01:44:47.138
Sit down. Make yourself at home.

01:44:47.306 --> 01:44:51.058
I sat in the dark so as to save you
the expense of the electricity. Ha-ha-ha.

01:44:51.226 --> 01:44:53.102
That was very considerate of you.

01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:54.604
It's a great pleasure.

01:44:56.857 --> 01:44:59.942
Uh, what can I do for you, Dr. Zemph?

01:45:00.861 --> 01:45:05.865
Dr. Humbert, would you mind
if I am putting to you the blunt question?

01:45:06.533 --> 01:45:08.409
No, by all means do so.

01:45:09.453 --> 01:45:15.666
We are wondering, has anybody, uh,
instructed Lolita in the facts of life?

01:45:16.126 --> 01:45:18.461
- The facts...?
- The facts of life.

01:45:18.629 --> 01:45:20.922
You see, Lolita is a sweet little child...

01:45:21.089 --> 01:45:23.841
...but the onset of maturity seems
to be giving her...

01:45:24.009 --> 01:45:26.260
...a certain amount of trouble.

01:45:27.554 --> 01:45:30.306
I really don't think
that this is a fit topic.

01:45:30.974 --> 01:45:36.729
Well, Dr. Humbert, to you she is still
the little girl what is cradled in the arms...

01:45:37.064 --> 01:45:40.524
...but to those boys over there
at the Beardsley High...

01:45:41.610 --> 01:45:43.986
...she is a lovely girl, you know...

01:45:44.446 --> 01:45:46.614
...with the swing, you know, the jazz...

01:45:46.782 --> 01:45:50.368
...and she has got the curvatures
which they take a lot of notice of.

01:45:50.535 --> 01:45:52.161
You and I, what are we?

01:45:52.329 --> 01:45:54.830
We are symbols of power,
sitting in our offices.

01:45:54.998 --> 01:45:57.667
We are making the signatures,
writing the contracts...

01:45:57.834 --> 01:45:59.835
...and decisions all the time.

01:46:00.003 --> 01:46:01.671
But if we cast our minds back....

01:46:01.838 --> 01:46:04.465
Just think, what were we only yesterday?

01:46:04.633 --> 01:46:06.759
Yesterday, Dr. Humbert...

01:46:06.927 --> 01:46:09.387
...you and I were little High School Jim...

01:46:09.554 --> 01:46:12.139
...and we were carrying
High School Jane's schoolbooks.

01:46:12.307 --> 01:46:14.267
You remember those days?

01:46:15.394 --> 01:46:20.314
In point of fact, uh, Dr. Zemph,
I am a lecturer in French literature.

01:46:21.483 --> 01:46:26.529
I have not made my point quite clear.

01:46:27.906 --> 01:46:32.034
I have some other details which
I would like to put to you, Dr. Humbert.

01:46:33.495 --> 01:46:37.873
Here. "She is defiant and rude.
Sighs a good deal in the class."

01:46:38.041 --> 01:46:39.250
She sighs, makes the sound of:

01:46:40.627 --> 01:46:43.796
"Chews gum vehemently."
All the time she is chewing this gum.

01:46:43.964 --> 01:46:45.214
"Handles books gracefully."

01:46:45.382 --> 01:46:47.633
That doesn't really matter.
"Voice is pleasant.

01:46:47.801 --> 01:46:51.012
Giggles rather often and is excitable."
She giggles at things.

01:46:51.179 --> 01:46:53.723
"A little dreamy. Concentration is poor."

01:46:53.890 --> 01:46:57.143
She looks at the book for a while
and then she gets fed up with it.

01:46:57.311 --> 01:46:58.769
"Has private jokes of her own."

01:46:58.937 --> 01:47:01.856
Which no one understands
so they can't enjoy them with her.

01:47:02.024 --> 01:47:05.401
"She either has exceptional control
or she has no control at all."

01:47:05.569 --> 01:47:07.236
We cannot decide which.

01:47:07.696 --> 01:47:11.741
Added to that, just yesterday,
uh, Dr. Humbert...

01:47:11.992 --> 01:47:16.454
...she wrote a most obscene word
with the lipstick, if you please...

01:47:16.621 --> 01:47:18.289
...on the health pamphlet.

01:47:19.166 --> 01:47:24.795
And so, in our opinion, she is suffering
from acute repression of the libido...

01:47:25.005 --> 01:47:27.173
...of the natural instincts.

01:47:29.176 --> 01:47:31.552
I fail to see the significance of all this...

01:47:31.720 --> 01:47:35.681
...as far as her record as a student
is concerned, Dr. Zemph.

01:47:36.516 --> 01:47:37.933
We Americans...

01:47:38.769 --> 01:47:40.770
...we are progressively modern.

01:47:41.813 --> 01:47:46.692
We believe that it is equally important
to prepare the pupils...

01:47:47.069 --> 01:47:51.113
...for the mutually satisfactory mating
and the successful child rearing.

01:47:51.281 --> 01:47:53.991
- That is what we believe.
- What do you suggest?

01:47:54.284 --> 01:47:55.910
I am suggesting...

01:47:56.411 --> 01:48:01.040
...that Dr. Cudler, who is the district
psychologist to the Board of Education...

01:48:01.375 --> 01:48:05.378
...should visit you in the home with
his three-member board of psychologists...

01:48:05.545 --> 01:48:09.090
...and once they are in the home
they can investigate thoroughly...

01:48:09.257 --> 01:48:12.885
...in the home situation,
with all four of them.

01:48:15.055 --> 01:48:18.933
Mm. The--? The home situation?

01:48:19.101 --> 01:48:22.937
So that they can get straight
at the source of the repression.

01:48:23.105 --> 01:48:25.856
But she's not being repressed,
Dr. Zemph.

01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:30.319
Do I take it then that, uh,
you are refusing to cooperate...

01:48:30.487 --> 01:48:33.030
...with Dr. Cudler
and those men what he's got?

01:48:33.198 --> 01:48:36.534
I am not refusing anything at all,
but please understand me.

01:48:36.701 --> 01:48:38.994
- No, I don't want to--
- What are you saying then?

01:48:39.621 --> 01:48:41.580
I absolutely refuse...

01:48:41.790 --> 01:48:45.418
...to have a quartet
of strange psychologists...

01:48:45.585 --> 01:48:47.711
...nosing around my house.

01:48:49.089 --> 01:48:50.589
Dr. Humbert...

01:48:51.591 --> 01:48:53.259
...I'm afraid that...

01:48:53.969 --> 01:48:55.928
...uh, you may have no choice.

01:48:56.430 --> 01:48:57.888
Cigarette?

01:48:58.056 --> 01:49:00.474
- No choice?
- No choice.

01:49:01.601 --> 01:49:02.852
Keep the pack.

01:49:04.271 --> 01:49:07.106
Look, Dr. Humbert...

01:49:07.274 --> 01:49:10.317
...I don't wish to take this
to a higher level of authority...

01:49:10.485 --> 01:49:13.487
- ...if I can possibly help it. Understand?
- I should hope not.

01:49:13.655 --> 01:49:15.865
So you must help me.

01:49:19.286 --> 01:49:20.536
What can I do?

01:49:20.829 --> 01:49:24.373
I don't know, but perhaps there is
another approach that we can take...

01:49:24.541 --> 01:49:28.752
...something new altogether,
some new approach. What would you say?

01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:30.045
Would you like that?

01:49:30.213 --> 01:49:35.134
Some new area of adjustment
that Lolita could find...

01:49:35.302 --> 01:49:39.638
...perhaps by taking a larger share
of the extracurricular school activities?

01:49:39.890 --> 01:49:43.767
I have never objected to her taking part
in the extracurricular....

01:49:45.353 --> 01:49:47.021
- School activities.
- Pardon me.

01:49:47.189 --> 01:49:49.940
You see, we have questioned Lolita
on the home situation...

01:49:50.108 --> 01:49:52.902
...but she says not a word,
stays with her lips buttoned up.

01:49:53.069 --> 01:49:56.197
So we are speaking with her friends,
and they are saying things...

01:49:56.364 --> 01:49:58.908
...which I wouldn't repeat to you here.

01:49:59.075 --> 01:50:02.912
But there is one thing which has arisen
from this which is quite clear:

01:50:03.079 --> 01:50:06.957
That you, Dr. Humbert,
should definitely un-veto...

01:50:07.125 --> 01:50:10.878
...that girl's nonparticipation
in the school play.

01:50:15.425 --> 01:50:19.345
Perhaps I was wrong in the attitude
that I took about the school play.

01:50:19.513 --> 01:50:22.223
That's very big of you to admit that.
While you're at it...

01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:25.392
...why don't you also loosen up
a bit more on the other two D's...

01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:27.728
...the "dating" and the "dance"?

01:50:28.688 --> 01:50:30.814
Do you think that those are
equally important?

01:50:30.982 --> 01:50:32.858
Dr. Humbert, I tell you what I do think.

01:50:33.026 --> 01:50:37.488
I feel that you and I should do all
in our power to stop that old Dr. Cudler...

01:50:37.656 --> 01:50:40.449
...and his quartet of psychologists
from fiddling around...

01:50:40.617 --> 01:50:43.118
...in the home situation.
That's what I feel.

01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:46.080
Don't you agree with me?

01:50:54.548 --> 01:50:58.717
I stand before you,
a rearsome bucky goat no more.

01:50:58.885 --> 01:51:00.761
Tremble not, little nymph.

01:51:00.929 --> 01:51:03.639
You see before you a weary goat.

01:51:04.558 --> 01:51:06.642
The bewitcher is bewitched.

01:51:07.352 --> 01:51:08.727
Look, Semiramis, look!

01:51:08.895 --> 01:51:10.813
Yes, the goat removeth his horns.

01:51:10.981 --> 01:51:13.774
- Let us take him to the Dark Kingdom.
- Yes.

01:51:13.942 --> 01:51:15.651
To the Dark Kingdom, away, away!

01:51:27.998 --> 01:51:29.915
Why, good evening, Dr. Humbert.

01:51:30.083 --> 01:51:31.292
Miss Starch! Good evening!

01:51:31.459 --> 01:51:35.170
- Did you enjoy the performance?
- Very much. I enjoyed every minute of it.

01:51:35.338 --> 01:51:38.173
I wondered if the symbolism
wasn't heavy-handed at times.

01:51:38.341 --> 01:51:41.844
I know what you mean,
but weren't the boys and girls charming?

01:51:42.012 --> 01:51:45.014
They were, weren't they?
And particularly little Lolita.

01:51:45.181 --> 01:51:48.017
She was quite perfect.
You must be awfully proud of her.

01:51:48.184 --> 01:51:51.645
Yes, I am. You know, her performance
took me completely by surprise.

01:51:51.813 --> 01:51:54.356
She made me promise not to watch
any of the rehearsals.

01:51:54.524 --> 01:51:56.317
They're so intense at that age.

01:51:56.484 --> 01:51:58.277
She must have worked awfully hard.

01:51:58.445 --> 01:52:00.821
No wonder you decided
to suspend her piano lessons.

01:52:00.989 --> 01:52:02.239
After all, there are only--

01:52:02.407 --> 01:52:05.200
I beg your pardon, did you say,
"suspend her piano lessons"?

01:52:05.368 --> 01:52:06.452
Yes.

01:52:06.620 --> 01:52:09.288
- Do you play, Dr. Humbert?
- Well, hardly at all now.

01:52:09.456 --> 01:52:11.665
Didn't she have a lesson with you
last Saturday?

01:52:11.833 --> 01:52:14.251
- No.
- Nor the preceding Saturday?

01:52:14.419 --> 01:52:16.712
No. She called to say
she was busy rehearsing.

01:52:16.880 --> 01:52:18.172
Busy rehearsing?

01:52:18.340 --> 01:52:21.467
As a matter of fact,
she hasn't had a lesson for...

01:52:21.676 --> 01:52:23.719
...let me see, four weeks.

01:52:24.346 --> 01:52:26.180
I hope I haven't spoken out of turn.

01:52:26.348 --> 01:52:29.350
No, no, not at all.
I must have misunderstood, that's all.

01:52:30.018 --> 01:52:33.520
By the way, Dr. Humbert,
there's so few people in Beardsley...

01:52:33.688 --> 01:52:36.315
...who appreciate music,
I was wondering, sometime...

01:52:36.483 --> 01:52:39.401
...if you'd like to come by
and I could play something for you.

01:52:39.569 --> 01:52:43.238
Yes, of course, certainly I will.
Thank you. Excuse me now.

01:52:47.702 --> 01:52:50.371
- Oh. Good evening, Dr. Humbert.
- Hi, Dad!

01:52:50.538 --> 01:52:52.581
- Wasn't it wonderful?
- How did you like it?

01:52:52.749 --> 01:52:54.583
There's a party for the cast and author.

01:52:54.751 --> 01:52:57.419
- Everybody's invited.
- I must take Lolita home.

01:52:57.587 --> 01:52:59.588
- What?
- Our starlet's had enough excitement.

01:52:59.756 --> 01:53:01.048
It's really gonna be fun.

01:53:01.216 --> 01:53:03.550
I wouldn't want you to miss
any more piano lessons.

01:53:03.718 --> 01:53:06.345
- I haven't missed any.
- You know what I'm talking about.

01:53:06.513 --> 01:53:07.554
Say good night.

01:53:07.722 --> 01:53:09.932
This isn't a regular party,
it's a cast party.

01:53:10.100 --> 01:53:11.183
Come on.

01:53:11.351 --> 01:53:14.520
- This is the cast party--
- We'll discuss it later.

01:53:18.024 --> 01:53:19.274
Brewster...

01:53:19.943 --> 01:53:22.444
...go and get some
Type A Kodachrome.

01:53:22.612 --> 01:53:23.987
Okay.

01:53:33.415 --> 01:53:35.332
- You're not going upstairs.
- Yes, I am!

01:53:35.500 --> 01:53:36.917
- We're having a talk.
- Let go!

01:53:37.085 --> 01:53:38.919
- You're hurting my arm!
- Stop shouting!

01:53:39.087 --> 01:53:41.338
You let me go, you jerk! Let go of me!

01:53:41.506 --> 01:53:44.091
Sit down! Now you're going to answer
a few questions.

01:53:44.259 --> 01:53:46.468
You've got a big, fat nerve,
dragging me away.

01:53:46.636 --> 01:53:49.054
- Stop that silly noise!
- Who do you think you are?

01:53:49.222 --> 01:53:50.806
Want the police to come in here?

01:53:50.974 --> 01:53:54.852
- Stop that shouting.
- I hope the police do come here. You freak!

01:53:56.062 --> 01:53:58.480
All right, now the doors are shut.
Come on, shout!

01:53:58.648 --> 01:54:02.151
Let's hear how loud you can shout.
Come on, come on, come on.

01:54:06.489 --> 01:54:08.449
Now perhaps you will tell me.

01:54:09.075 --> 01:54:13.078
What were you doing on Saturday
between 2 and 4 in the afternoon?

01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:15.289
I went to my piano lesson.

01:54:15.457 --> 01:54:16.623
- That's a lie.
- It is not.

01:54:16.791 --> 01:54:20.085
I happen to know you haven't been
to a piano lesson for four weeks.

01:54:20.253 --> 01:54:21.670
Yeah? Just ask Miss Starch.

01:54:21.838 --> 01:54:23.964
I asked Miss Starch.
How do you think I know?

01:54:24.132 --> 01:54:27.426
She told me. I saw her tonight.
Didn't you see her at the performance?

01:54:27.594 --> 01:54:28.802
Yeah.

01:54:28.970 --> 01:54:29.970
Now tell me.

01:54:30.138 --> 01:54:32.639
What have you been doing
these afternoons?

01:54:36.478 --> 01:54:39.480
- You really wanna know?
- Yes, I do. I really want to know.

01:54:39.647 --> 01:54:43.609
All right. I'm gonna tell you
the real truth of what I've been doing.

01:54:43.860 --> 01:54:45.569
I've been going to extra rehearsals.

01:54:45.737 --> 01:54:49.156
That's the most fatuous lie
you could possibly think up.

01:54:49.324 --> 01:54:51.575
Don't say any more.
I know what you've been doing.

01:54:51.743 --> 01:54:54.119
You've been with this leading man
of yours...

01:54:54.287 --> 01:54:56.163
...this Roy, isn't that so?

01:54:58.208 --> 01:54:59.249
You're sick.

01:54:59.417 --> 01:55:01.960
Stop! Don't throw those silly,
silly clichés at me.

01:55:02.128 --> 01:55:03.545
Don't tell me any more.

01:55:03.713 --> 01:55:05.172
You've been with this boy?

01:55:05.340 --> 01:55:07.466
- Come on, tell me.
- You need help.

01:55:07.842 --> 01:55:12.054
- You're imagining things.
- Shut up, Lolita! Stop that silly talk!

01:55:25.693 --> 01:55:26.902
Lolita.

01:55:35.036 --> 01:55:36.495
Lolita.

01:55:36.663 --> 01:55:40.499
Now, if you swear to me that this isn't true
I promise that I will believe you.

01:55:40.667 --> 01:55:44.044
I won't swear anything.
You'll never believe me, no matter what.

01:55:44.212 --> 01:55:45.629
I will believe you.

01:55:45.797 --> 01:55:47.756
No, you won't. Let's face it, you won't.

01:55:47.924 --> 01:55:51.176
I'll forget the whole thing.
I'll never question you about it again.

01:55:51.344 --> 01:55:54.471
No, you'll never believe me.
Why should I swear to you?

01:56:00.436 --> 01:56:02.187
All right, I believe you.

01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:04.231
It's partly my fault. I realize that.

01:56:04.399 --> 01:56:07.693
It's something that's happened
on account of this horrible place.

01:56:07.861 --> 01:56:10.279
These people poking their noses
into our business...

01:56:10.446 --> 01:56:13.448
...and I never see you anymore,
with your soda fountains, and your extra--

01:56:14.826 --> 01:56:16.243
Stop doing that!

01:56:25.169 --> 01:56:27.546
But we could leave this place perhaps.

01:56:30.049 --> 01:56:33.051
Yes, there's nothing to keep us here.

01:56:33.845 --> 01:56:37.264
We haven't any obligations here.
We don't owe rent to anybody.

01:56:37.432 --> 01:56:41.393
We could just pack up our bags.
Tonight. We could go now.

01:56:41.561 --> 01:56:45.105
I could take you for a wonderful trip
round the country.

01:56:45.940 --> 01:56:47.566
You can't leave here.

01:56:48.109 --> 01:56:49.234
Why not?

01:56:49.485 --> 01:56:51.778
You've gotta work. What about your job?

01:56:51.946 --> 01:56:55.240
My job doesn't mean anything.
I could always publish articles....

01:56:55.408 --> 01:56:59.036
My book's going to be published soon.
It's a wonderful idea.

01:56:59.579 --> 01:57:02.247
I have to go to school.
What about my education?

01:57:02.415 --> 01:57:05.792
Education? What sort of an education
do you think you're getting here?

01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:10.255
You got a much better education
when you were traveling around with me.

01:57:10.506 --> 01:57:13.300
Well, look, the play has two more
performances next week.

01:57:13.468 --> 01:57:16.970
Don't start talking about the play.
That's what's just come between us.

01:57:17.138 --> 01:57:19.389
That's what started this whole row!

01:57:20.433 --> 01:57:22.643
Don't you want to get back
to where we were...

01:57:22.810 --> 01:57:24.853
...before we came to this horrible place?

01:57:25.021 --> 01:57:27.230
Don't you want to come away with me?

01:57:27.565 --> 01:57:28.607
No!

01:57:28.816 --> 01:57:30.359
I hate you!

01:57:30.526 --> 01:57:32.110
- I hate you!
- Lolita!

01:57:32.278 --> 01:57:34.279
You want to stay with this filthy boy!

01:57:34.447 --> 01:57:35.614
Yes!

01:57:35.782 --> 01:57:38.033
- Why can't you leave me alone?
- Shut your mouth...

01:57:38.201 --> 01:57:40.994
- ...you horrid little psychopath!
- Don't tell me what to do!

01:57:41.162 --> 01:57:42.454
I promise you one thing:

01:57:42.622 --> 01:57:44.998
You're not gonna see
these filthy boys anymore.

01:57:45.166 --> 01:57:47.542
- That's one thing that--
- I've got news for you.

01:57:47.710 --> 01:57:50.379
I'll do anything I want to,
anytime I want to...

01:57:50.546 --> 01:57:52.547
- ...with anyone I want...
- Shut your filthy mouth!

01:57:53.883 --> 01:57:55.342
- ...and you can't stop me!
- Shut up!

01:58:02.684 --> 01:58:05.811
- Miss Le Bone.
- Dr. Humbert, uh, may I come in?

01:58:06.270 --> 01:58:07.854
What can I do for you?

01:58:08.147 --> 01:58:10.899
Well, this is a little awkward
to say, but I'm....

01:58:11.067 --> 01:58:15.237
I thought you ought to know, this noise,
I can hear every word next door.

01:58:15.530 --> 01:58:17.614
Well, we were having a family row.

01:58:17.782 --> 01:58:20.242
The child's voice is very shrill
when she gets upset.

01:58:20.410 --> 01:58:23.578
Yes, of course, I understand perfectly,
but, well, I--

01:58:23.746 --> 01:58:28.000
I happen to have company and he's
a minister of the church, and you know....

01:58:28.167 --> 01:58:30.502
Perhaps you can convey
my apologies to him.

01:58:30.670 --> 01:58:32.504
We were quarrelling
about piano lessons.

01:58:32.672 --> 01:58:33.755
Hello, dear.

01:58:33.923 --> 01:58:35.424
Hello, Miss Le Bone.

01:58:36.509 --> 01:58:37.801
Good night.

01:58:38.678 --> 01:58:41.930
- What a pretty getup.
- She was in the school play tonight.

01:58:42.098 --> 01:58:44.683
Yes, of course, the school play.

01:58:45.685 --> 01:58:47.102
Dr. Humbert, I do hope...

01:58:47.270 --> 01:58:51.481
...you don't think that I'm presuming
on our good neighbor relations...

01:58:51.691 --> 01:58:54.609
...but, um, I should tell you
that the neighbors are beginning...

01:58:54.777 --> 01:58:57.070
...to get curious about you and your girl.

01:58:57.238 --> 01:59:01.241
- I can't think why they should do that.
- Well, you know how people talk. Ha, ha.

01:59:03.786 --> 01:59:05.704
I must get back to my guest.

01:59:06.247 --> 01:59:07.706
Would you care to join us?

01:59:07.874 --> 01:59:11.668
That's very nice of you, thank you,
but I'll take a rain check, as they say.

01:59:11.836 --> 01:59:13.128
Oh, right.

01:59:13.337 --> 01:59:14.796
Well, uh, good night.

01:59:15.214 --> 01:59:16.381
Good night.

01:59:34.650 --> 01:59:36.109
Come on, we're going home.

01:59:36.277 --> 01:59:38.278
- Wait.
- I forbade you to go to the party.

01:59:38.446 --> 01:59:39.446
I wasn't going to.

01:59:39.614 --> 01:59:41.740
- Who were you talking to?
- I tried to call you.

01:59:41.908 --> 01:59:45.619
You were speaking to somebody just now
on the telephone. Who was that?

01:59:45.787 --> 01:59:47.537
I got a wrong number.

01:59:49.040 --> 01:59:50.999
Listen, I've decided something.

01:59:51.167 --> 01:59:52.417
Yes?

01:59:52.585 --> 01:59:54.586
I want to leave school.

01:59:54.754 --> 01:59:55.796
You what?

01:59:55.963 --> 01:59:57.839
I don't want you to be
mad at me anymore.

01:59:58.007 --> 02:00:00.133
Everything's gonna be great
from now on.

02:00:00.301 --> 02:00:03.386
- You mean that?
- I hate school, and I hate the play.

02:00:03.679 --> 02:00:06.181
I really do. I never want to go back.

02:00:06.599 --> 02:00:07.933
That's good.

02:00:08.142 --> 02:00:10.602
Let's leave tomorrow.
We can go for a long trip...

02:00:10.770 --> 02:00:13.396
...and we'll go wherever I want to,
won't we?

02:00:13.564 --> 02:00:15.649
Ha-ha-ha. Yes, my darling.

02:00:15.817 --> 02:00:18.026
- Are you glad?
- Yes, of course I am.

02:00:18.194 --> 02:00:20.112
To hell with the play! See what I mean?

02:00:20.279 --> 02:00:21.655
Yes, that's good.

02:00:22.323 --> 02:00:25.700
Let's go home.
I feel sort of romantic.

02:00:34.127 --> 02:00:37.212
The brakes were relined,
the water pipes unplugged...

02:00:37.463 --> 02:00:39.131
...the valves ground.

02:00:39.465 --> 02:00:42.217
We had promised Beardsley School
that we would be back...

02:00:42.385 --> 02:00:46.054
...as soon as my Hollywood engagement
came to an end.

02:00:46.639 --> 02:00:51.393
Inventive Humbert was to be, I hinted,
chief consultant in production of a film...

02:00:51.561 --> 02:00:55.730
...dealing with existentialism,
still a hot thing at the time.

02:01:49.452 --> 02:01:54.080
I cannot tell you the exact day
when I first knew with utter certainty...

02:01:54.248 --> 02:01:56.958
...that a strange car was following us.

02:01:57.501 --> 02:02:01.087
Queer how I misinterpreted
the designation of doom.

02:02:22.902 --> 02:02:24.444
Fill her up, please.

02:03:09.031 --> 02:03:11.533
I'm cold, I'm gonna get a sweater.

02:03:11.701 --> 02:03:12.701
- Oh!
- Watch it, please!

02:03:12.868 --> 02:03:16.705
Do you have to drive so fast?
You're gonna get us killed.

02:03:16.998 --> 02:03:19.332
What's the big, fat hurry, anyway?

02:03:19.500 --> 02:03:22.419
There's been a car following us
which we've been trying to lose.

02:03:22.586 --> 02:03:23.586
What?

02:03:23.754 --> 02:03:26.506
However, I haven't seen it recently.
I think we've lost it.

02:03:26.674 --> 02:03:27.674
Really?

02:03:27.842 --> 02:03:31.011
I didn't want to scare you,
but it's followed us for three days...

02:03:31.178 --> 02:03:33.471
...and yesterday it was parked
outside the motel.

02:03:33.639 --> 02:03:36.808
- I haven't seen any car. Are you sure?
- Yes, I am sure.

02:03:36.976 --> 02:03:38.727
I think you're imagining things.

02:03:38.894 --> 02:03:41.146
What did that man ask you
in the service station?

02:03:41.314 --> 02:03:42.314
What man?

02:03:42.481 --> 02:03:45.984
There was a man in the service station.
I saw you when I was in the john.

02:03:46.152 --> 02:03:49.237
I didn't see any man at the....
Oh, yes, that man.

02:03:49.405 --> 02:03:52.657
Uh, he wondered if I had a map.
I guess he got lost.

02:03:52.825 --> 02:03:55.118
Lo, now listen, please.

02:03:55.286 --> 02:03:58.038
I don't know if you're lying to me,
or if you're insane...

02:03:58.205 --> 02:04:01.333
...and I don't really care any longer,
but that man, I believe...

02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:03.460
...was in the car
that's been following us.

02:04:03.627 --> 02:04:05.712
- That's ridiculous.
- I think he's a cop.

02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:06.963
- A cop?
- Yes.

02:04:07.131 --> 02:04:10.175
If he is, the worst thing we can do
is let him know we're scared.

02:04:10.343 --> 02:04:12.344
Let's just ignore him, and slow down.

02:04:12.511 --> 02:04:14.554
Would you kindly tell me, please...

02:04:14.722 --> 02:04:17.557
...what you said to him exactly
and what he said to you?

02:04:17.725 --> 02:04:19.017
I told you.

02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:21.895
Well, did he ask you
where we were going?

02:04:22.063 --> 02:04:24.272
All he asked was if I had a map.

02:04:24.440 --> 02:04:27.442
I'd have thought that he'd ask
the man at the service station.

02:04:27.610 --> 02:04:30.028
Well, I would have thought
he would too.

02:04:30.446 --> 02:04:31.905
Anyhow, I think we've lost him.

02:04:37.203 --> 02:04:38.661
I told you not to drive so fast!

02:04:38.829 --> 02:04:40.121
Leave me alone, can't you?!

02:04:40.289 --> 02:04:44.167
- Don't talk to me that way.
- Do you think I wanted to have a blowout?

02:04:45.252 --> 02:04:47.045
Hey, look, all the nines changed
to the next--

02:04:47.213 --> 02:04:50.882
- Shh! There it is.
- What?

02:04:51.050 --> 02:04:53.051
The car. Don't you recognize it now?

02:04:53.219 --> 02:04:54.260
No.

02:04:54.428 --> 02:04:55.512
Don't look now.

02:04:55.679 --> 02:04:58.473
I don't want him to think
that we've seen him.

02:05:01.185 --> 02:05:04.270
- What's he stopping for?
- Maybe he's gonna help us.

02:05:04.438 --> 02:05:07.899
He can't help us,
stopping way back there like that.

02:05:08.317 --> 02:05:13.154
It can't be the police because if they were,
they'd pull up beside us and write a ticket.

02:05:13.322 --> 02:05:15.657
- But the police--
- Shh! I'm trying to think.

02:05:15.825 --> 02:05:21.204
Maybe it's a special kind of police
who are just supposed to follow people.

02:05:21.414 --> 02:05:24.290
Yeah, like the vice squad. Scaddy, wow.

02:05:24.458 --> 02:05:27.627
Be quiet. Stop talking.
We've got to think about this.

02:05:28.087 --> 02:05:30.004
What are we going to do?

02:05:30.172 --> 02:05:31.923
Am I being quiet enough?

02:05:32.091 --> 02:05:35.802
Don't try to be clever, please.
I've got a terrific pain in my arm.

02:05:35.970 --> 02:05:38.555
- Really? Hmm.
- I don't know what I did to it.

02:05:41.016 --> 02:05:42.851
Well, what are we gonna do now?

02:05:43.018 --> 02:05:44.811
I'm gonna get out of this car...

02:05:44.979 --> 02:05:47.439
...walk down the road
and speak to him face to face.

02:05:47.606 --> 02:05:49.357
I'll say, "What are you doing?"

02:05:49.525 --> 02:05:51.484
- I wouldn't do that.
- Why not?

02:05:51.652 --> 02:05:54.028
Well, it, uh, might be dangerous.

02:05:58.659 --> 02:06:00.452
My arm is killing me.

02:06:01.579 --> 02:06:05.623
I don't seem to be able
to breathe properly.

02:06:06.041 --> 02:06:08.543
It's probably just gas pains.

02:06:09.712 --> 02:06:11.504
Yeah, it must be that.

02:06:12.131 --> 02:06:15.300
Maybe you ought to see a doctor
in the next town?

02:06:15.759 --> 02:06:17.635
No, I'll be all right.

02:06:20.389 --> 02:06:23.933
It's probably just something I ate.

02:06:24.977 --> 02:06:26.394
Wait a minute.

02:06:26.979 --> 02:06:30.732
I once read in a Reader's Digest
that this is the way heart attacks start.

02:06:30.900 --> 02:06:31.941
Shut up, will you?!

02:06:32.359 --> 02:06:33.943
Shut up yourself!

02:06:34.278 --> 02:06:36.571
I'm tired of hearing
about your moans and groans.

02:06:36.739 --> 02:06:40.325
If you want to know something,
I feel pretty lousy myself.

02:06:45.915 --> 02:06:47.248
He's moving.

02:06:47.917 --> 02:06:49.417
Big deal.

02:06:50.377 --> 02:06:52.170
He's turning around.

02:06:58.302 --> 02:06:59.677
He's going away.

02:07:04.934 --> 02:07:06.518
Are you feeling cold?

02:07:07.019 --> 02:07:08.186
Yeah.

02:07:08.729 --> 02:07:10.647
I feel all achy.

02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:14.025
I bet I'm getting the Asiatic flu.

02:07:14.777 --> 02:07:17.320
Here, let me feel your head.

02:07:22.493 --> 02:07:25.620
- We make a fine pair, don't we?
- Mm.

02:07:26.038 --> 02:07:31.960
You just relax and stretch out on the seat,
if that will make you feel better...

02:07:32.670 --> 02:07:35.296
...and I will see what I can do about...

02:07:36.549 --> 02:07:38.216
...changing the tire.

02:07:53.190 --> 02:07:55.191
- Good morning, Miss....
- Good morning, Mr. Humbert.

02:07:58.070 --> 02:08:01.322
Good morning, Mr. Humbert.
We seem to be going the same way.

02:08:01.490 --> 02:08:04.325
I was just about to give your daughter
some medicine.

02:08:04.493 --> 02:08:06.786
- How is she?
- She's much better today.

02:08:06.954 --> 02:08:09.706
Her temperature's normal
and her cough's gone.

02:08:09.873 --> 02:08:11.207
Here's your father, dear.

02:08:11.375 --> 02:08:12.875
- Hi.
- Hello.

02:08:15.421 --> 02:08:17.672
- How are you feeling?
- I feel fine.

02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:19.924
You're looking much better.

02:08:23.929 --> 02:08:27.015
- What gruesome flowers.
- Oh?

02:08:27.933 --> 02:08:29.350
But thanks anyway.

02:08:29.518 --> 02:08:32.061
Nurse, can you find, uh, some water
to put these in, please?

02:08:32.229 --> 02:08:33.229
Certainly.

02:08:33.397 --> 02:08:35.398
Have you been getting notes
in the hospital?

02:08:35.566 --> 02:08:36.816
Excuse me.

02:08:37.359 --> 02:08:40.820
Does your father think that you get notes
from my boyfriend?

02:08:45.284 --> 02:08:48.661
I just thought it might be a bill
from the hospital or something.

02:08:48.829 --> 02:08:50.872
Do you have to antagonize everybody?

02:08:51.040 --> 02:08:53.291
It was a perfectly reasonable question.

02:08:55.377 --> 02:08:58.338
What's the matter with you anyway?
You look kind of slimy.

02:08:58.505 --> 02:09:02.050
- I'm afraid I'm coming down with a cold.
- Mm.

02:09:02.217 --> 02:09:04.385
- Caught it from me?
- I suppose.

02:09:04.678 --> 02:09:08.306
Mr. Humbert, would you please
move your car to the visitors' parking lot?

02:09:08.474 --> 02:09:11.309
I'm sorry. I was in a hurry
and I didn't feel too bright.

02:09:11.477 --> 02:09:14.479
But you've parked it right next to a sign
saying "staff only."

02:09:14.647 --> 02:09:16.522
All right. I shall leave in a moment.

02:09:16.690 --> 02:09:19.233
I'm sorry,
but these are the hospital rules.

02:09:22.488 --> 02:09:24.364
Mary was only trying to be helpful.

02:09:24.531 --> 02:09:27.533
I've no doubt she's been just as helpful
with you all the time.

02:09:27.701 --> 02:09:28.993
She has.

02:09:29.161 --> 02:09:32.997
Uh, and I shouldn't wonder if you two
have been exchanging confessions.

02:09:33.165 --> 02:09:36.167
Come on now,
let's not start that all up again.

02:09:38.921 --> 02:09:40.922
I brought you some books.

02:09:42.049 --> 02:09:44.759
My friend, Professor Baer,
The Romantic Poets...

02:09:44.927 --> 02:09:48.429
...and here's something you might like,
The History of Dancing...

02:09:48.597 --> 02:09:53.267
...and Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man
by James Joyce, you might like.

02:09:53.477 --> 02:09:56.688
- Whose are these? These are not yours.
- Those are Mary's.

02:09:56.855 --> 02:10:01.275
And since when have nurses
worn dark glasses when on duty?

02:10:02.820 --> 02:10:05.029
There we go again.

02:10:07.199 --> 02:10:10.076
When did the doctor say
that you can leave the hospital?

02:10:10.244 --> 02:10:11.244
What?

02:10:11.412 --> 02:10:14.122
Are you going to read the magazine
or talk to me?

02:10:14.289 --> 02:10:15.540
Sure.

02:10:15.708 --> 02:10:17.959
When did the doctor say
that you can leave?

02:10:18.127 --> 02:10:20.420
I think he wants me to stay
another 48 hours.

02:10:20.587 --> 02:10:23.464
That's all right. We can start early
on Tuesday morning...

02:10:23.632 --> 02:10:27.176
...and we'll make the Mexican border
in three days...

02:10:27.386 --> 02:10:31.055
...and that'll be the end of all those
mysterious agents following us around.

02:10:31.223 --> 02:10:34.142
Mr. Humbert, I must ask you
to move your car.

02:10:35.102 --> 02:10:36.602
I'm just leaving.

02:10:41.108 --> 02:10:42.316
Goodbye.

02:10:46.613 --> 02:10:48.489
Might catch your cold.

02:10:53.078 --> 02:10:55.955
I shall stay in tonight
and nurse my cold...

02:10:56.331 --> 02:10:58.833
...so I shan't see you
until tomorrow morning.

02:10:59.168 --> 02:11:00.293
Bye-bye.

02:11:51.094 --> 02:11:52.136
Hello?

02:11:52.888 --> 02:11:55.306
Uh, hello.
Is that Professor Humbert?

02:11:55.724 --> 02:11:56.766
Yes.

02:11:56.934 --> 02:11:58.810
How are you, professor?

02:11:59.520 --> 02:12:01.103
I'm-- Who is this, please?

02:12:01.271 --> 02:12:05.817
Heh, heh. I'm sort of really
sorry to, uh, disturb you.

02:12:05.984 --> 02:12:09.320
I hope I really haven't woken you
at this terribly late hour.

02:12:09.488 --> 02:12:11.948
I was wondering if you'd been
enjoying your stay...

02:12:12.115 --> 02:12:14.408
...in our lovely little town here.

02:12:14.576 --> 02:12:15.660
Who's this calling?

02:12:15.828 --> 02:12:17.745
Oh, my name....
It doesn't matter about that.

02:12:17.913 --> 02:12:20.706
It's really an obscure
and unremarkable name...

02:12:20.874 --> 02:12:22.375
...you understand, professor.

02:12:22.543 --> 02:12:27.213
But my department is sort of concerned,
uh, sort of concerned with the bizarre...

02:12:27.422 --> 02:12:31.884
...rumors that have been circulating
about you and that lovely, remarkable girl...

02:12:32.052 --> 02:12:33.761
...you've been traveling with.

02:12:33.929 --> 02:12:36.889
Look, I'm very much afraid
you'll have to identify yourself...

02:12:37.057 --> 02:12:40.768
...because this conversation is becoming
more and more preposterous.

02:12:40.936 --> 02:12:43.479
Professor, now tell me something...

02:12:43.647 --> 02:12:46.190
...I guess all this traveling around
you do...

02:12:46.358 --> 02:12:49.610
...you don't get much time
to, uh, see a psychiatrist regularly...

02:12:49.778 --> 02:12:51.028
...is that right?

02:12:51.196 --> 02:12:54.699
I have no psychiatrist,
and I don't need a psychiatrist!

02:12:55.117 --> 02:12:57.034
I'll tell you why I ask, you see...

02:12:57.202 --> 02:13:00.413
...you're, uh, classified in our files,
professor...

02:13:00.581 --> 02:13:03.749
...you're classified in our files
as a white, widowed male.

02:13:03.917 --> 02:13:07.503
I wonder if you'd be prepared
to give our investigator...

02:13:07.838 --> 02:13:10.548
...a report, professor, on your...

02:13:10.966 --> 02:13:13.217
...uh, current sex life, if any.

02:13:13.385 --> 02:13:16.470
I don't know who you are,
and I certainly have no interest...

02:13:16.638 --> 02:13:19.640
...in your investigators,
so I'm afraid that you will have to...

02:13:19.808 --> 02:13:21.767
...terminate this conversation.

02:13:21.935 --> 02:13:24.312
Professor, "afraid" is Freudian lingo--

02:13:44.499 --> 02:13:46.792
- Can I help you, sir?
- Yes. My name is Humbert.

02:13:46.960 --> 02:13:50.463
I want to pay the bill of Miss Haze
in Room 3. I'm taking her home.

02:13:50.631 --> 02:13:52.590
Have you gotten permission
from the doctor?

02:13:52.758 --> 02:13:55.468
I can do what I choose.
It's nothing to do with the doctor.

02:13:55.636 --> 02:13:57.678
You must have permission
from the doctor.

02:13:57.846 --> 02:13:59.972
What is this, a prison or a hospital?

02:14:00.140 --> 02:14:03.225
I'm afraid you'll have to speak
to Dr. Keagy.

02:14:03.769 --> 02:14:07.229
Calling Dr. Keagy.
Dr. Keagy, come to Reception, please.

02:14:07.397 --> 02:14:09.273
I'll just go into her room to alert her.

02:14:09.441 --> 02:14:11.108
No. No, you can't go in there.

02:14:11.276 --> 02:14:13.486
I'll get her to get her bags ready.

02:14:13.654 --> 02:14:17.114
Dr. Keagy will be down in just a minute.
Why don't you wait?

02:14:22.412 --> 02:14:24.956
- Yes, Miss Fromkiss?
- Dr. Keagy, Mr. Humbert.

02:14:25.540 --> 02:14:27.792
How long have you had that cough,
Mr. Humbert?

02:14:27.960 --> 02:14:30.670
I'm all right, thank you.
I simply want to pay the bill...

02:14:30.837 --> 02:14:34.048
...for Miss Haze in Room 3
and take her away from here.

02:14:34.216 --> 02:14:36.050
Miss Haze, Room 3.

02:14:36.301 --> 02:14:38.594
Wasn't she discharged
earlier this evening?

02:14:38.762 --> 02:14:41.347
- I'll see.
- No, she couldn't have been.

02:14:42.182 --> 02:14:44.642
Yes, she was discharged
at 8:15 this evening.

02:14:44.810 --> 02:14:45.810
That's impossible.

02:14:45.978 --> 02:14:49.146
- Right here, she was discharged at 8:15.
- I don't care about that.

02:14:49.314 --> 02:14:52.733
You, Nurse What's-your-name.
She's still in there, isn't she?

02:14:52.901 --> 02:14:55.403
Mr. Humbert, your daughter left
earlier this evening.

02:14:55.570 --> 02:14:56.821
That's ridiculous.

02:14:56.989 --> 02:14:58.072
Where are you going?

02:14:58.407 --> 02:14:59.615
Come back here, now.

02:14:59.783 --> 02:15:02.326
You can't go in there now,
it's a hospital.

02:15:02.494 --> 02:15:04.787
- Where have you put her?
- Get your hands off!

02:15:04.955 --> 02:15:06.163
Where is she?

02:15:07.040 --> 02:15:09.166
Hold him. Hold him.

02:15:09.334 --> 02:15:10.543
Let go of me!

02:15:10.711 --> 02:15:13.045
- What do you think you're doing?
- Hold it!

02:15:13.213 --> 02:15:14.213
Where is she?

02:15:14.381 --> 02:15:16.382
- Easy.
- Sidney, get a straightjacket.

02:15:16.717 --> 02:15:18.050
All right. I'm calm.

02:15:18.218 --> 02:15:20.344
Doctor, this man must be psychotic.

02:15:20.679 --> 02:15:22.221
His stepdaughter was a patient...

02:15:22.389 --> 02:15:24.932
...and she left this evening
in care of her uncle.

02:15:25.100 --> 02:15:27.393
- Her uncle! Did you say "uncle"?
- Yes.

02:15:27.561 --> 02:15:28.978
- Let me go.
- Hold him!

02:15:35.068 --> 02:15:36.944
Hold him now. Got him, Andre?

02:15:37.112 --> 02:15:38.404
Yeah. Yeah.

02:15:38.572 --> 02:15:40.114
All right. Let me go.

02:15:40.407 --> 02:15:41.907
Now look, mister...

02:15:42.492 --> 02:15:45.661
...you've caused quite
a serious disturbance here. Now, hold it!

02:15:45.829 --> 02:15:47.455
If you like, we'll call the police.

02:15:47.622 --> 02:15:51.751
The police? No. We don't need the police.
It's quite all right.

02:15:51.918 --> 02:15:54.670
All right.
Let's get this business straight.

02:15:55.547 --> 02:15:59.300
This girl was officially discharged
earlier tonight in the care of her uncle.

02:15:59.468 --> 02:16:00.843
If you say so.

02:16:01.011 --> 02:16:03.054
Has she or hasn't she an uncle?

02:16:03.305 --> 02:16:05.097
All right, let's say she has an uncle.

02:16:05.265 --> 02:16:07.975
What do you mean,
"let's say she has an uncle"?

02:16:08.393 --> 02:16:10.144
All right, she has an uncle.

02:16:10.312 --> 02:16:13.314
Uncle Gus, yes, I remember now...

02:16:13.482 --> 02:16:17.610
...he was going to pick her up here
at the hospital. I forgot that.

02:16:18.070 --> 02:16:19.820
- You forgot?
- Yes, I forgot.

02:16:19.988 --> 02:16:22.656
- It's a strange thing to forget.
- No, it's not so strange.

02:16:22.824 --> 02:16:25.993
You don't know my brother Gus.
He's very easy to forget.

02:16:26.328 --> 02:16:28.079
He's drunk, that's what's the matter.

02:16:28.246 --> 02:16:30.164
That's right,
I've been drinking too much.

02:16:30.332 --> 02:16:32.208
I have personal problems,
you understand?

02:16:32.375 --> 02:16:35.753
- Here it is, doctor.
- No, no, it's all right, Sidney.

02:16:44.429 --> 02:16:46.638
Would you like some black coffee
or something?

02:16:46.807 --> 02:16:50.308
No, not now, thank you.
I really ought to move on now.

02:16:51.061 --> 02:16:52.977
Think you feel well enough to leave?

02:16:53.146 --> 02:16:56.816
Yes. Just let me up.
I'm fine now, much better.

02:16:56.983 --> 02:16:58.734
See that he gets home all right.

02:16:58.902 --> 02:17:00.528
All right, let him up.

02:17:06.618 --> 02:17:11.038
Uh, she didn't, by any chance,
leave any message for me?

02:17:12.290 --> 02:17:13.999
No, I suppose not.

02:20:09.301 --> 02:20:10.592
Well...

02:20:11.219 --> 02:20:13.012
...gee, what a surprise.

02:20:15.765 --> 02:20:18.892
So this is what Mrs. Richard T. Schiller
looks like.

02:20:19.894 --> 02:20:23.939
You'll have to excuse my appearance,
but you've caught me on ironing day.

02:20:26.735 --> 02:20:28.277
But do come in.

02:20:29.195 --> 02:20:31.697
You're looking marvelous.
Can I take your coat?

02:20:31.865 --> 02:20:33.699
No, I'd rather keep it.

02:20:34.826 --> 02:20:36.994
I wrote to you about a week ago.

02:20:37.162 --> 02:20:39.580
I was beginning to think
you were sore or something.

02:20:39.748 --> 02:20:42.374
I must say I wouldn't blame you
if you were.

02:20:42.625 --> 02:20:45.169
A fine thing, me dropping out of sight
for so long...

02:20:45.337 --> 02:20:47.254
...and then writing you for a handout.

02:20:47.422 --> 02:20:49.840
- Would you like a cup of coffee?
- No, thank you--

02:20:50.008 --> 02:20:51.633
Or a drink, maybe?

02:20:51.926 --> 02:20:52.968
No.

02:20:53.428 --> 02:20:56.263
Ugh. I won't be able to do that
in another month.

02:20:56.431 --> 02:20:57.598
Is that him?

02:20:58.391 --> 02:20:59.516
The one facing us.

02:20:59.684 --> 02:21:01.268
Yes, that's Dick.

02:21:03.063 --> 02:21:05.022
He doesn't know a thing
about you and me...

02:21:05.190 --> 02:21:06.648
...so please watch what you say.

02:21:06.816 --> 02:21:09.943
That's ridiculous. You don't expect me
to believe that, do you?

02:21:10.111 --> 02:21:13.072
Why not?
You don't think I'd tell him, do you?

02:21:13.365 --> 02:21:15.491
Who does he think that I am?

02:21:15.700 --> 02:21:17.117
My stepfather.

02:21:21.831 --> 02:21:24.625
Then this isn't the man who took you
from the hospital?

02:21:24.793 --> 02:21:25.959
No, of course not.

02:21:28.088 --> 02:21:29.922
How long have you known him?

02:21:30.090 --> 02:21:34.051
About a year. I met him in Phoenix.
I was working as a waitress.

02:21:34.844 --> 02:21:37.137
Who is the man that I'm looking for?

02:21:37.305 --> 02:21:40.682
There's no point in going into that.
It's all over.

02:21:40.850 --> 02:21:42.559
Lolita, I have to know.

02:21:43.186 --> 02:21:44.978
I'm sorry, but I can't tell you.

02:21:46.940 --> 02:21:48.982
Lolita, I have a perfect right
to know this.

02:21:50.151 --> 02:21:53.112
Criminy! I should never
have written to you.

02:21:54.239 --> 02:21:56.949
You wouldn't have written
if you hadn't needed the money.

02:21:57.117 --> 02:21:59.034
Now, if you're a sensible girl...

02:21:59.202 --> 02:22:01.495
...and if you want
what I've come to give you...

02:22:01.663 --> 02:22:03.747
...you'll tell me what I want to know.

02:22:09.337 --> 02:22:11.505
Do you remember Dr. Zemph?

02:22:12.257 --> 02:22:13.799
Dr. Zemph?

02:22:14.175 --> 02:22:17.803
That German psychologist
that came to see you at Beardsley.

02:22:18.471 --> 02:22:20.013
Was it him?

02:22:20.181 --> 02:22:21.181
Not exactly.

02:22:21.349 --> 02:22:23.934
I didn't come here
to play guessing games.

02:22:24.310 --> 02:22:25.561
Tell me who it was.

02:22:25.728 --> 02:22:27.521
Well, give me a chance to explain.

02:22:27.689 --> 02:22:28.897
All right.

02:22:29.858 --> 02:22:32.317
You remember that car
that used to follow us around?

02:22:32.694 --> 02:22:34.820
I'm not likely to forget that in a hurry.

02:22:36.781 --> 02:22:39.783
Do you remember Mother's old flame
at the school dance?

02:22:39.951 --> 02:22:42.369
No, you probably wouldn't
remember him.

02:22:43.455 --> 02:22:47.583
You remember the guy that you talked to
at that hotel on the way back from camp?

02:22:47.750 --> 02:22:50.669
He pretended he was part
of that police convention.

02:22:50.837 --> 02:22:52.713
Vaguely, yes.

02:22:54.966 --> 02:22:58.051
And do you remember that guy
who called you at the motel?

02:22:58.219 --> 02:23:00.095
The night you disappeared?

02:23:00.597 --> 02:23:02.347
Yes, I remember him very well.

02:23:03.308 --> 02:23:05.517
And yet, you still haven't guessed?

02:23:06.478 --> 02:23:09.563
I told you that I'm not
playing games with you.

02:23:09.856 --> 02:23:10.898
Tell me who it was.

02:23:12.317 --> 02:23:14.568
It was Clare Quilty.

02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:17.196
Who was Clare Quilty?

02:23:17.739 --> 02:23:19.198
All of them, of course.

02:23:20.325 --> 02:23:22.743
You mean, Dr. Zemph,
he was Clare Quilty?

02:23:22.911 --> 02:23:24.578
Well, congratulations.

02:23:25.580 --> 02:23:29.583
I don't suppose it ever occurred to you
that when you moved into our house...

02:23:29.751 --> 02:23:32.669
...my whole world didn't revolve
around you.

02:23:33.755 --> 02:23:35.881
I'd had a crush on him
ever since the times...

02:23:36.049 --> 02:23:38.217
...that he used to come and visit Mother.

02:23:38.384 --> 02:23:40.135
He wasn't like you and me.

02:23:40.887 --> 02:23:42.721
He wasn't a normal person.

02:23:43.389 --> 02:23:44.932
He was a genius.

02:23:46.017 --> 02:23:47.518
He had a kind of...

02:23:47.852 --> 02:23:52.105
...beautiful Japanese,
Oriental philosophy of life.

02:23:52.941 --> 02:23:56.276
You know that hotel we stopped at
on the way back from camp?

02:23:56.444 --> 02:23:58.946
It was just by accident
that he was staying there...

02:23:59.113 --> 02:24:02.866
...but it didn't take him long to figure out
what was going on between us.

02:24:03.034 --> 02:24:06.119
From that moment on he was up
to every trick he could think of.

02:24:06.412 --> 02:24:09.790
And he did all these brilliant tricks
for the sheer fun of tormenting me?

02:24:10.291 --> 02:24:14.378
Well, sometimes he had to,
like the German psychologist bit.

02:24:14.796 --> 02:24:17.714
He had to trick you into letting me
be in his play...

02:24:17.882 --> 02:24:19.758
...otherwise how would I ever see him?

02:24:19.926 --> 02:24:22.094
So that's why you wanted
to be in the play?

02:24:22.554 --> 02:24:23.554
That's right.

02:24:23.721 --> 02:24:26.348
The times you were
supposed to be practicing the piano...

02:24:26.516 --> 02:24:28.642
- ...you were actually with this man?
- Mm-hm.

02:24:29.143 --> 02:24:32.312
I guess he was the only guy
I was ever really crazy about.

02:24:34.607 --> 02:24:36.149
Aren't you forgetting something?

02:24:38.069 --> 02:24:39.820
Oh, Dick.

02:24:40.572 --> 02:24:42.322
Dick's very sweet...

02:24:42.657 --> 02:24:44.658
...and we're very happy together...

02:24:44.826 --> 02:24:47.452
...but I guess
it's just not the same thing.

02:24:48.538 --> 02:24:51.498
And I? I suppose I never counted,
of course.

02:24:51.916 --> 02:24:56.712
You have no right to say that.
After all, the past is the past.

02:25:00.425 --> 02:25:03.635
What happened to
this Oriental-minded genius?

02:25:03.886 --> 02:25:07.848
Look, don't make fun of me.
I don't have to tell you a blasted thing.

02:25:08.016 --> 02:25:09.308
I'm not making fun of you.

02:25:09.475 --> 02:25:11.810
I'm merely trying to find out
what happened.

02:25:11.978 --> 02:25:14.521
When you left the hospital,
where did he take you?

02:25:14.689 --> 02:25:15.731
To New Mexico.

02:25:15.898 --> 02:25:17.357
Whereabouts in New Mexico?

02:25:17.525 --> 02:25:19.318
To a dude ranch near Santa Fe.

02:25:20.111 --> 02:25:23.947
The only problem with it was,
he had a bunch of weird friends there.

02:25:24.115 --> 02:25:27.034
- What kind of weird friends?
- Weird.

02:25:27.201 --> 02:25:30.746
Painters, nudists,
writers, weightlifters.

02:25:30.913 --> 02:25:33.290
I figured I could take anything
for a few weeks...

02:25:33.458 --> 02:25:35.876
...because I loved him.
He was going to Hollywood...

02:25:36.044 --> 02:25:37.878
...to write one of those spectaculars...

02:25:38.046 --> 02:25:40.589
...and he promised to get me
a studio contract...

02:25:40.882 --> 02:25:42.591
...but it never turned out that way.

02:25:42.759 --> 02:25:45.218
Instead he wanted me
to cooperate with the others...

02:25:45.386 --> 02:25:47.888
...in making some kind of....
You know, an art movie.

02:25:49.390 --> 02:25:51.183
An art movie.

02:25:51.809 --> 02:25:53.060
Yeah.

02:25:53.478 --> 02:25:54.853
And you did it?

02:25:55.021 --> 02:25:57.230
No, I didn't do it.

02:25:57.857 --> 02:25:59.650
And so he kicked me out.

02:26:01.152 --> 02:26:03.111
You could have come back to me.

02:26:10.411 --> 02:26:12.913
Excuse me, sweetheart,
Bill's cut his thumb.

02:26:13.081 --> 02:26:14.289
It's just a scratch.

02:26:14.457 --> 02:26:17.918
Dick, this is my stepfather,
Professor Humbert.

02:26:18.336 --> 02:26:20.712
- How do you do, professor?
- How do you do?

02:26:20.880 --> 02:26:23.090
This is our neighbor, Bill Crest.

02:26:23.257 --> 02:26:25.884
- Glad to meet you, professor.
- How do you do?

02:26:26.302 --> 02:26:30.180
Gee, uh, Lo's told me so much about you.

02:26:32.684 --> 02:26:35.686
Well, uh, I guess we might as well
fix that thumb.

02:26:37.105 --> 02:26:39.314
This is a grand surprise, professor.

02:26:39.857 --> 02:26:42.943
When you didn't answer the letter
we were afraid that you were...

02:26:43.111 --> 02:26:45.362
...still sore at Lo for having run away
from home.

02:26:45.530 --> 02:26:46.947
Oh.

02:26:47.824 --> 02:26:49.282
Yes.

02:26:50.368 --> 02:26:53.036
- How about a beer?
- No, thank you.

02:26:53.204 --> 02:26:55.831
I'll bet you're dry after that long drive.

02:26:56.082 --> 02:26:58.750
This is some of that foreign beer.
You'll like it.

02:26:58.918 --> 02:27:00.127
No beer, thank you.

02:27:00.294 --> 02:27:01.336
Bandages are upstairs.

02:27:01.504 --> 02:27:03.380
- Sorry.
- That's all right.

02:27:04.424 --> 02:27:07.509
- Can I get you anything else? You hungry?
- Nothing, thank you.

02:27:07.677 --> 02:27:09.428
How are you two getting along?

02:27:09.595 --> 02:27:10.804
Just fine.

02:27:11.806 --> 02:27:13.473
Speak up. His phone's on the blink.

02:27:13.641 --> 02:27:14.850
One of those for me?

02:27:15.017 --> 02:27:16.309
Sure, hon.

02:27:20.148 --> 02:27:22.107
I hope you're planning
on staying a while.

02:27:22.734 --> 02:27:26.278
You caught us a little unprepared
but we'll try and make you feel at home.

02:27:26.446 --> 02:27:28.488
I shall have to be on my way, I'm afraid.

02:27:28.948 --> 02:27:30.782
You can have the bed upstairs.

02:27:30.950 --> 02:27:33.410
We sleep down here because
Lo likes to watch the TV.

02:27:33.578 --> 02:27:35.036
He can't stay, Dick.

02:27:35.204 --> 02:27:37.956
Oh. What a shame. I wish you could.

02:27:40.042 --> 02:27:42.669
Why don't you tell him about Alaska?

02:27:42.920 --> 02:27:46.006
Yeah. Uh, I guess Lo explained to you
about going to Alaska...

02:27:46.174 --> 02:27:48.008
...and all that, in the letter.

02:27:48.176 --> 02:27:49.968
It's a marvelous opportunity up there.

02:27:50.136 --> 02:27:53.513
An opportunity for a guy like me
to get in on the ground floor.

02:27:53.681 --> 02:27:55.390
Industry's opening up...

02:27:55.558 --> 02:27:57.768
...and if we can scrape together
enough money...

02:27:57.935 --> 02:28:00.854
...with maybe your help, heh,
well, we can go.

02:28:01.105 --> 02:28:04.524
We've got a few back debts,
we kind of overextended ourselves.

02:28:05.943 --> 02:28:07.444
How are the Farlows?

02:28:08.070 --> 02:28:11.990
Oh. John Farlow's all right. It was he
who gave me your letter, of course.

02:28:12.158 --> 02:28:14.910
She's sure a swell kid, Professor Haze.
She sure is.

02:28:15.077 --> 02:28:19.956
She's just nuts about dogs and kids.
She's gonna make a swell mother too.

02:28:20.666 --> 02:28:25.086
Alaska's a great place for kids, you know.
Lots of room for them to run around.

02:28:26.798 --> 02:28:28.840
Well, it's as good as new.

02:28:29.217 --> 02:28:33.887
Well, we'd better get back to work, Bill.
I guess you two have a lot to talk about.

02:28:34.847 --> 02:28:37.474
- Been a pleasure meeting you, professor.
- Thank you.

02:28:37.642 --> 02:28:41.019
When you've finished, Dad--
I hope you don't mind me calling you that.

02:28:41.187 --> 02:28:44.189
--come out back and I'll show you
what I'm making for the kid.

02:28:44.357 --> 02:28:45.440
Thank you.

02:28:45.650 --> 02:28:48.777
Just holler, sweetheart,
if you want me for KP.

02:28:53.574 --> 02:28:55.867
Dick's awfully sweet, isn't he?

02:28:57.745 --> 02:29:00.288
- Come here.
- What's going on?

02:29:01.249 --> 02:29:02.374
What are you doing?

02:29:02.542 --> 02:29:05.252
This may be neither here nor there
but I've got to say it.

02:29:05.419 --> 02:29:07.170
Life is very short.

02:29:07.505 --> 02:29:10.090
Between here and that old car outside
are 25 paces.

02:29:10.258 --> 02:29:12.926
Make them, now, right now.

02:29:13.094 --> 02:29:14.135
What?

02:29:14.303 --> 02:29:16.930
Come away with me now, just as you are.

02:29:17.265 --> 02:29:20.559
You mean you'll give us the money
only if I go to a hotel with you?

02:29:20.726 --> 02:29:22.352
No, you've got it all wrong.

02:29:22.520 --> 02:29:25.105
I want you to leave your husband
and this awful house.

02:29:25.273 --> 02:29:29.276
I want you to live with me and die with me
and everything with me.

02:29:29.610 --> 02:29:31.194
You must be crazy.

02:29:31.362 --> 02:29:35.282
No, I'm perfectly serious, Lo.
I've never been less crazy in all my life.

02:29:35.449 --> 02:29:38.535
We'll start afresh. We can forget
everything that has happened.

02:29:38.703 --> 02:29:40.954
- No, it's too late.
- No, it's not too late.

02:29:41.122 --> 02:29:42.122
Keep your voice down.

02:29:42.290 --> 02:29:44.583
Don't tell me it's too late,
because it's not.

02:29:44.750 --> 02:29:46.877
If you want time to think,
that's all right...

02:29:47.044 --> 02:29:50.130
...because I've waited already
for three years and I can wait...

02:29:50.298 --> 02:29:52.424
...for the rest of my life if necessary.

02:29:52.592 --> 02:29:55.635
You're not giving anything up,
there's nothing here to keep you.

02:29:55.803 --> 02:29:59.139
All right, this man is married to you,
but that's purely incidental.

02:29:59.307 --> 02:30:02.309
It was an accident that you met him
in the first place.

02:30:02.476 --> 02:30:05.061
You're not bound to him,
whereas you are bound to me...

02:30:05.229 --> 02:30:08.940
...by everything that we have
lived through together, you and I.

02:30:09.108 --> 02:30:11.985
I'm going to have his baby
in three months.

02:30:13.571 --> 02:30:14.821
I know.

02:30:15.406 --> 02:30:19.993
I've ruined too many things in my life.
I can't do that to him, he needs me.

02:30:23.122 --> 02:30:25.165
Come on now, don't make a scene.

02:30:25.333 --> 02:30:28.418
Stop crying! He could walk in here
at any minute.

02:30:29.545 --> 02:30:32.505
Will you please stop crying?

02:30:42.058 --> 02:30:44.392
There are no strings attached.

02:30:46.312 --> 02:30:48.229
It's your money anyway.

02:30:49.190 --> 02:30:51.900
It comes from the rent of the house.

02:30:53.235 --> 02:30:55.028
There's $400 in cash.

02:30:55.738 --> 02:30:57.697
Four hundred dollars.

02:30:58.282 --> 02:31:01.910
I've made out a check here for $2500.

02:31:02.620 --> 02:31:05.163
Two thousand, five hundred....

02:31:05.790 --> 02:31:07.207
There's someone in Ramsdale...

02:31:07.375 --> 02:31:11.086
...who's prepared to take care
of the mortgages on the house...

02:31:11.253 --> 02:31:14.506
...and make a down payment of $10,000.

02:31:16.300 --> 02:31:17.968
There's the papers.

02:31:19.637 --> 02:31:22.263
You mean we're getting $13,000?

02:31:23.724 --> 02:31:25.350
That's wonderful.

02:31:25.559 --> 02:31:27.477
Come on now, don't cry.

02:31:31.607 --> 02:31:33.233
I'm sorry.

02:31:33.776 --> 02:31:35.527
Try to understand.

02:31:38.656 --> 02:31:41.533
I'm really sorry
that I cheated so much...

02:31:42.034 --> 02:31:45.245
...but I guess that's just
the way things are.

02:31:49.875 --> 02:31:51.668
Where are you going?

02:31:56.340 --> 02:31:58.800
Hey, listen. Let's keep in touch.

02:31:58.968 --> 02:32:01.469
I'll write to you when we get to Alaska.

02:32:53.397 --> 02:32:54.564
Quilty!

02:32:57.693 --> 02:32:58.943
Quilty!

02:32:59.305 --> 02:33:05.773
