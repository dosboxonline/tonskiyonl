WEBVTT

00:07.541 --> 00:10.875
[Dark Wizard]
Let the Harfoots be your sole concern.

00:10.875 --> 00:13.583
<i>I will see to the</i> Istar <i>myself.</i>

00:13.583 --> 00:16.250
The Dark Wizard found his staff.

00:16.250 --> 00:19.333
The time has come for you to find yours.

00:19.333 --> 00:21.833
Unless there is somewhere else
you wish to be.

00:21.833 --> 00:22.916
Nori.

00:22.916 --> 00:25.000
[screams]

00:25.208 --> 00:27.083
Unless I find her soon, she will die.

00:27.083 --> 00:28.750
Both of them will die.

00:28.750 --> 00:30.875
Your friend or your destiny?

00:30.875 --> 00:32.291
The choice is yours.

00:33.416 --> 00:35.541
[Prince Durin IV]
<i>There's something under the mines.</i>

00:35.666 --> 00:36.875
[vocalizes, gasps]

00:37.750 --> 00:39.416
[Prince Durin IV] A nameless evil.

00:39.416 --> 00:40.916
You mustn't dig!

00:40.916 --> 00:46.083
[King Durin] <i>We have barely taken
a thimble from the ocean of her riches.</i>

00:46.083 --> 00:48.916
Your father, he turned his axe on my men.

00:49.666 --> 00:51.708
You take that army to Eregion now,

00:51.708 --> 00:54.541
and Khazad-dûm
might not be here when you return.

00:55.041 --> 00:56.541
[both grunting]

00:58.041 --> 00:59.333
<i>I'm Estrid.</i>

00:59.333 --> 01:01.333
Fancy you never want
for water on your island.

01:01.333 --> 01:03.583
In Númenor, we have water
in most of our homes.

01:03.583 --> 01:04.833
I'd like to see that.

01:04.833 --> 01:06.750
I wager your betrothed would too.

01:12.333 --> 01:15.125
[Lord Belzagar]
<i>The Valar have deemed her...</i>

01:15.125 --> 01:16.833
[roaring]

01:20.458 --> 01:21.916
- Innocent!
- [people cheering]

01:21.916 --> 01:24.708
Hail Tar-Míriel, Queen of the Sea!

01:24.708 --> 01:27.208
[people] Hail Queen Míriel. Hail!

01:30.458 --> 01:31.500
[groans]

01:31.500 --> 01:34.208
Once the Deceiver obtains a being's trust,

01:34.208 --> 01:37.083
he gains the ability
to sculpt their very thoughts.

01:37.083 --> 01:38.708
[Halbrand] <i>Fighting at your side...</i>

01:38.708 --> 01:39.625
I felt...

01:39.625 --> 01:40.958
I felt it, too.

01:40.958 --> 01:43.250
[Gil-galad]
<i>You have already been affected once.</i>

01:43.250 --> 01:44.208
[Galadriel] <i>Yes.</i>

01:44.208 --> 01:46.708
<i>He knows my mind. And I know his.</i>

01:46.708 --> 01:49.083
Which is why I must face him.

01:49.083 --> 01:51.000
You cannot face him alone.

01:51.000 --> 01:54.000
The High King believes I may be
vulnerable to deception.

01:54.000 --> 01:55.625
And why would he think that?

01:55.625 --> 01:56.541
Stop it, Elrond.

01:57.291 --> 02:00.500
[Celebrimbor] <i>Nine Rings
to enslave the world of Men.</i>

02:01.041 --> 02:03.583
As he... enslaved me.

02:04.250 --> 02:06.791
- [Annatar] <i>I want the Nine!</i>
- [Celebrimbor] <i>No!</i>

02:06.791 --> 02:09.000
They will be far from your reach by now.

02:09.000 --> 02:12.500
Then you are going to bring them to me
and place them in my hand.

02:12.500 --> 02:15.125
[Adar] <i>Together, this crown and your Rings</i>

02:15.125 --> 02:18.333
would be powerful enough
to truly destroy Sauron forever.

02:18.833 --> 02:20.791
[Galadriel] <i>Sauron has no army of his own.</i>

02:20.791 --> 02:22.916
- [in Sindarin] Attack!
- [all shouting]

02:23.583 --> 02:25.708
[Galadriel]
<i>So he's lured yours here instead.</i>

02:25.708 --> 02:26.750
[all shouting]

02:26.750 --> 02:28.750
<i>He wants you to attack Eregion.</i>

02:31.708 --> 02:33.166
<i>This is all his design!</i>

02:34.333 --> 02:36.291
<i>This is what Sauron wants!</i>

02:38.375 --> 02:39.458
- [grunts]
- [groans]

02:42.750 --> 02:44.583
[thunder breaking]

03:01.750 --> 03:03.750
[Prince Durin IV breathing heavily]

03:10.791 --> 03:13.041
- [panting]
- [miner groans]

03:13.041 --> 03:14.125
It's the Ring.

03:14.916 --> 03:18.458
It has him, mind and soul.

03:22.125 --> 03:23.458
Get him to the healing chamber.

03:23.458 --> 03:25.083
What are you gonna do?

03:25.833 --> 03:29.875
No matter what you hear,
do not follow me down that mine.

03:29.875 --> 03:30.958
Durin.

03:35.750 --> 03:37.416
[breathing heavily]

03:45.541 --> 03:46.583
[grunts]

03:49.208 --> 03:50.208
[grunts]

03:51.750 --> 03:52.625
[grunts]

03:52.625 --> 03:54.625
[rumbling]

03:58.791 --> 04:00.041
[thuds]

04:01.916 --> 04:03.000
[thuds]

04:05.083 --> 04:07.500
[Balrog growls]

04:08.333 --> 04:09.375
[grunts]

04:11.166 --> 04:12.375
Take off the Ring!

04:15.375 --> 04:16.375
[grunts]

04:17.125 --> 04:18.500
I said, take it off!

04:18.625 --> 04:19.500
[grunts]

04:19.500 --> 04:21.375
Or I'll take off the whole hand!

04:33.666 --> 04:35.833
You're strong enough to wield an axe.

04:38.500 --> 04:42.125
But are you strong enough to use it
against your father?

04:45.458 --> 04:49.291
No, Father. I'm not.

04:53.708 --> 04:55.708
You've always been stronger than me.

05:01.875 --> 05:06.375
Do you remember when I was a wee lad,
and we'd arm wrestle?

05:07.541 --> 05:13.541
You'd let me lift my hand, just enough,
to think maybe I could win.

05:14.791 --> 05:17.041
And then you'd slam it down again.

05:17.666 --> 05:23.625
And I knew there was nothing stronger
than my father.

05:25.375 --> 05:27.250
Be strong again, Father.

05:28.333 --> 05:30.958
Take it off. I beg you.

05:35.000 --> 05:39.208
A Dwarf... should never beg.

05:43.458 --> 05:44.458
No!

05:46.000 --> 05:47.000
[gasps]

05:59.041 --> 06:00.875
Come and see, my son!

06:02.166 --> 06:05.458
Come and see the true wealth
of our mountain.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.333
Behold.

06:21.166 --> 06:23.166
The dynasty of Durin.

06:32.875 --> 06:35.125
[dramatic music playing]

06:44.833 --> 06:48.583
But to see our mountain the way I do,

06:49.291 --> 06:52.583
you have to wear a ring, my son.

06:56.625 --> 06:59.041
It's not our mountain, Father.

07:00.791 --> 07:02.625
You taught me that.

07:03.291 --> 07:07.708
With these Rings, it could be.

07:16.375 --> 07:18.791
[Balrog growling]

07:23.291 --> 07:24.583
[rumbling]

07:29.416 --> 07:30.416
[Prince Durin IV] Run.

07:31.166 --> 07:32.333
Run, Father!

07:35.166 --> 07:36.833
[gasps, shouts]

07:37.416 --> 07:39.500
[groans]

07:45.000 --> 07:46.625
[roars]

07:52.125 --> 07:53.458
[shouts]

07:54.583 --> 07:56.375
[groans]

08:02.541 --> 08:05.000
[roars]

08:10.208 --> 08:11.500
[roars]

08:12.416 --> 08:14.000
[King Durin] Durin.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.833
Durin! [panting]

08:15.833 --> 08:17.208
Durin.

08:21.541 --> 08:23.166
[somber music playing]

08:33.875 --> 08:36.541
[chiming]

08:42.250 --> 08:47.375
I never let you lift your hand.
It was you.

08:48.541 --> 08:51.625
Just you. Getting stronger.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.000
Forgive me, my son.

09:05.083 --> 09:06.291
King Durin.

09:13.708 --> 09:16.375
[roaring]

09:16.833 --> 09:18.916
[King Durin shouts]

09:18.916 --> 09:21.125
No! No!

09:21.125 --> 09:22.041
[Disa] No!

09:41.541 --> 09:42.541
[clanks]

09:42.541 --> 09:44.041
- [whooshes]
- [rumbling]

09:50.625 --> 09:52.625
[opening theme music playing]

11:23.166 --> 11:25.166
[choral music playing]

11:37.333 --> 11:38.166
[horse chuffs]

11:44.583 --> 11:46.000
[horse grunts]

11:50.291 --> 11:51.375
Huh.

11:59.750 --> 12:01.125
[chiming]

12:18.666 --> 12:21.375
[Dark Wizard]
Manwë promised you would come.

12:22.250 --> 12:26.000
I confess, my patience wavered,

12:26.000 --> 12:30.958
but my faith in you, old friend, did not.

12:31.458 --> 12:32.625
You know me?

12:32.625 --> 12:36.125
[Dark Wizard] Know you? We are as kin.

12:36.125 --> 12:39.000
Five of us, there were.

12:39.875 --> 12:42.333
But you were the one who convinced me

12:42.333 --> 12:45.916
to leave the Uttermost West
for this world,

12:45.916 --> 12:49.916
because you knew none of us

12:49.916 --> 12:53.666
could ever hope to defeat Sauron alone.

12:55.208 --> 12:58.125
But I was told you wish
to ally yourself with Sauron.

12:59.791 --> 13:04.375
You journeyed to Rhûn seeking answers,
old friend.

13:04.375 --> 13:08.291
Follow me. And you shall have them.

13:09.083 --> 13:12.541
Your past, your name.

13:12.541 --> 13:15.333
Even your staff.

13:17.875 --> 13:22.583
I did not make the journey alone.
Two halflings gave me aid.

13:22.583 --> 13:27.416
Yes. Elanor Brandyfoot
and Poppy Proudfellow.

13:27.416 --> 13:29.291
You need not worry.

13:29.291 --> 13:33.500
I have seen to it,
the small ones are safe.

13:33.500 --> 13:34.916
Come!

13:39.291 --> 13:40.333
Poppy! Nori!

13:40.333 --> 13:43.750
[Dark Wizard]
I instructed they were not to be harmed.

13:43.750 --> 13:48.791
[Brânk] They won't be, once you have
given us all that we were promised.

13:50.958 --> 13:52.583
Forgive me, old friend.

13:52.583 --> 13:56.041
I thought these nomads
might help me find you.

13:56.041 --> 14:02.041
I see now I was foolish to place trust
in such low company.

14:02.041 --> 14:06.666
[Brânk] My people were once Kings, wizard.

14:07.083 --> 14:07.958
[whooshes]

14:09.041 --> 14:10.583
- [groans]
- [crashes]

14:13.375 --> 14:14.750
[in Rhûnnic] Go!

14:14.750 --> 14:15.833
Go now!

14:17.291 --> 14:19.291
[Nori, in English] We tried to find you.

14:19.500 --> 14:21.958
My dear friends.

14:23.708 --> 14:26.375
Is he the fella you were looking
for out here all along?

14:29.333 --> 14:31.291
Dark Wizard?

14:32.625 --> 14:36.791
That is a name I do not embrace.

14:36.791 --> 14:39.750
Placed upon me by Men long ago,

14:39.750 --> 14:43.750
out of ignorance and fear of our kind.

14:43.750 --> 14:48.833
I hope my actions today will lead you
to know better of me.

14:52.166 --> 14:54.000
This the sort of action you mean?

14:54.000 --> 14:57.166
You pity him whose blade
was at your throat?

14:57.833 --> 14:58.833
Yes.

15:00.416 --> 15:03.958
Pity will not defeat Sauron.

15:06.666 --> 15:10.166
And if you were to defeat Sauron,
would that suffice?

15:11.083 --> 15:13.750
Or would you seek to become his successor?

15:14.583 --> 15:20.125
Walk with me, and in time,
we will both be his successors.

15:27.791 --> 15:30.333
I would sooner
walk this desert forevermore,

15:30.333 --> 15:32.250
nameless and forgotten.

15:36.416 --> 15:38.750
Then you give me little choice,
old friend.

15:39.041 --> 15:40.208
[Dark Wizard yells]

15:40.208 --> 15:42.166
[rumbling]

15:42.166 --> 15:43.958
[dramatic music playing]

15:48.875 --> 15:50.333
Everybody out!

15:50.333 --> 15:52.375
[Stoors shouting and screaming]

15:52.916 --> 15:55.833
I only hope losing those you care for most

15:55.833 --> 16:01.166
will give you a taste of the suffering
all Middle-earth will know,

16:01.166 --> 16:03.791
should Sauron prove victorious.

16:04.500 --> 16:05.541
No!

16:07.250 --> 16:12.541
When your senses have returned,
I will be waiting.

16:13.791 --> 16:15.375
[Stoors screaming]

16:16.375 --> 16:18.333
[tense music playing]

16:28.416 --> 16:30.250
Nori! Nori.

16:43.458 --> 16:45.625
[bells tolling]

17:01.166 --> 17:05.000
We expect answers.
What is the meaning of this?

17:05.125 --> 17:07.375
I was ordered only to gather you here.

17:07.375 --> 17:09.083
I've no answers to give.

17:09.083 --> 17:10.916
[marching footsteps approach]

17:10.916 --> 17:13.250
[crowd murmuring]

17:20.541 --> 17:21.916
Leaders of The Faithful.

17:26.083 --> 17:28.916
I thank you all for coming
at this late hour.

17:28.916 --> 17:30.083
To what end?

17:31.041 --> 17:34.875
We have learned why Míriel
was able to bewitch the sea.

17:34.875 --> 17:38.541
It would seem she has an ally
of cunning powers.

17:38.541 --> 17:42.208
An ally who has already
bruised Númenor once

17:42.208 --> 17:46.125
and is now gathering strength
to make us bleed.

17:46.708 --> 17:48.000
Absurd.

17:48.541 --> 17:54.291
The Sea Queen has no allies
but the Valar who uphold her.

18:08.916 --> 18:10.333
Sauron?

18:10.333 --> 18:14.500
All so-called Faithful are now declared

18:15.416 --> 18:18.208
traitors of Westernesse!

18:18.208 --> 18:19.833
[crowd clamoring]

18:23.708 --> 18:29.000
<i>As of this hour, all loyal Númenóreans
are called upon to oppose this threat.</i>

18:29.791 --> 18:31.500
[screams]

18:32.625 --> 18:34.916
[sobbing]

18:35.083 --> 18:35.916
[grunts]

18:38.833 --> 18:39.833
Traitor!

18:43.375 --> 18:45.000
[man] Pharazôn, you cannot do this!

18:48.416 --> 18:49.625
[guard] Come on, traitor.

19:09.000 --> 19:10.916
[clamoring]

19:24.916 --> 19:25.916
Father!

19:26.833 --> 19:28.000
Father, please.

19:30.208 --> 19:32.000
There's no time to explain.

19:33.875 --> 19:35.125
They're coming for you.

19:39.625 --> 19:41.750
Check in there. Clear them out.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.416
[guard shouting]

19:47.375 --> 19:49.333
Are there any Faithful in there?

19:49.333 --> 19:50.666
No. Move along.

19:51.250 --> 19:52.250
[guard 1] Hm.

19:53.208 --> 19:55.541
Shall I tell Ar-Pharazôn
of your insolence?

19:55.541 --> 19:58.333
[guard 2] Do not resist.
Don't push back. Move!

20:01.416 --> 20:03.041
Move along.

20:03.666 --> 20:04.666
[guard 1] Hm.

20:06.666 --> 20:10.875
Right. All of them.
And up there too. All of it.

20:19.500 --> 20:22.958
[Elendil] We must leave for the West.
There are Faithful there.

20:22.958 --> 20:24.708
My son Anárion amongst them.

20:24.708 --> 20:27.333
I know a ferryman
who can get us outside the city.

20:29.166 --> 20:30.833
You must travel only by night.

20:30.833 --> 20:33.583
The stars shall be your friends
and make safe your steps.

20:36.625 --> 20:37.833
[Elendil] And yours.

20:40.541 --> 20:42.666
One does not need eyes
to lead in the dark.

20:48.916 --> 20:51.208
What cowardice have I ever shown
to make you think

20:51.208 --> 20:53.958
I would even consider
making safe my own skin

20:53.958 --> 20:55.583
at the peril of yours?

20:56.166 --> 20:59.666
My place is here. You know it is.

21:00.708 --> 21:05.125
Then where is mine, if not with you?

21:07.416 --> 21:09.666
It is called Narsil.

21:27.250 --> 21:28.583
[Elendil] The white flame.

21:33.708 --> 21:35.708
Reclaim your Lordship.

21:35.708 --> 21:39.416
And with this sword, your destiny.

21:46.375 --> 21:47.541
[blade swishes]

21:53.416 --> 21:54.791
[whooshing]

22:03.333 --> 22:05.416
[coughing]

22:09.166 --> 22:10.791
[grunts, groans]

22:16.250 --> 22:17.791
[shouting]

22:20.291 --> 22:21.708
[grunting]

22:25.458 --> 22:27.125
[groans, screams]

22:33.958 --> 22:37.083
[speaking Sindarin]

22:37.833 --> 22:38.875
[grunts]

22:41.666 --> 22:42.666
[groans]

22:42.666 --> 22:44.916
[shouting]

22:51.083 --> 22:53.416
[groans]

22:53.958 --> 22:54.958
[Galadriel, in English] Go!

22:59.166 --> 23:01.375
There's no way out, Elf. [groans]

23:04.458 --> 23:05.750
[Galadriel] This way.

23:05.750 --> 23:06.833
[girl] Mama.

23:23.625 --> 23:25.208
[panting]

23:30.208 --> 23:31.916
[shouting]

23:33.666 --> 23:35.416
[gasping]

23:37.875 --> 23:39.666
I'm the one your Lord-father wants.

23:40.625 --> 23:43.666
Set them free. And I will go willingly.

23:44.291 --> 23:46.458
Give me one reason, Elf.

23:46.458 --> 23:47.500
[Orc chuckles]

23:49.166 --> 23:50.708
I will give you Nine.

24:04.750 --> 24:06.541
[bowstring draws]

24:07.666 --> 24:09.083
[groans, shuddering]

24:20.125 --> 24:21.125
[bow clatters]

24:28.291 --> 24:29.458
[shuddering]

24:33.833 --> 24:36.166
[Sauron] Look what you have done
to yourself.

24:36.166 --> 24:37.958
[shuddering]

24:43.000 --> 24:44.416
[explosion in distance]

24:48.833 --> 24:50.500
They will be here any moment.

24:51.375 --> 24:53.875
Have you ever seen Orcs
in the heat of combat?

24:54.416 --> 24:56.041
A frenzy comes over them.

24:57.250 --> 24:58.666
A blood-hunger.

24:59.625 --> 25:05.125
When Gondolin fell,
they say it went on, and on.

25:05.125 --> 25:06.708
[whimpering]

25:08.166 --> 25:09.583
For weeks.

25:10.166 --> 25:14.583
Tell me where you have hidden the Rings.
And I will end your suffering now.

25:17.000 --> 25:19.291
[Celebrimbor] It must be nearly noontide.

25:20.916 --> 25:25.541
One used to hear the kingfishers,
flying to the river.

25:28.083 --> 25:32.625
It is a pity how you have silenced them.

25:34.083 --> 25:36.125
All I have done has been for you.

25:36.125 --> 25:40.125
Yours was the fire
that crafted the marvels of the age.

25:40.125 --> 25:43.416
I wish only to share them with the world.

25:46.416 --> 25:47.625
Please.

25:49.750 --> 25:50.833
Let me.

25:52.791 --> 25:54.791
But the Rings are beyond your reach.

25:55.583 --> 25:57.958
As I shall be, ere long.

25:58.958 --> 26:02.083
For soon I shall go
to the shores of the morning.

26:04.458 --> 26:09.208
Borne hence,
by a wind that you can never follow!

26:15.291 --> 26:16.333
[whimpers]

26:30.291 --> 26:32.291
There are ways of keeping you alive.

26:33.875 --> 26:35.083
[in Sindarin] Friend.

26:37.250 --> 26:40.416
[in English] Must I show you my mastery
of that craft as well?

26:41.458 --> 26:43.000
Craft. [chuckles]

26:45.125 --> 26:47.291
Your only craft is treachery.

26:47.291 --> 26:52.166
So pure, it shall betray
the very hand that forges it.

26:52.833 --> 26:55.708
Your words are empty.

26:55.708 --> 26:57.041
No.

26:58.208 --> 27:01.125
No, hear me. Hear me!

27:03.500 --> 27:05.541
Shadow of Morgoth.

27:07.083 --> 27:10.125
Hear the dying words of Celebrimbor.

27:11.833 --> 27:16.166
The Rings of Power shall destroy you.

27:17.250 --> 27:21.291
And in the end, I foresee,

27:21.291 --> 27:26.041
one alone shall prove your utter ruin!

27:27.041 --> 27:27.875
[shouts]

27:27.875 --> 27:28.958
[groans]

27:33.625 --> 27:36.333
You're wrong. I am their creator.

27:38.375 --> 27:39.791
I am their master.

27:41.416 --> 27:42.416
No.

27:44.750 --> 27:48.583
You are their... prisoner.

27:49.750 --> 27:53.500
Sauron, Lord...

27:56.666 --> 27:58.333
...of the Rings.

28:35.875 --> 28:39.000
Are you him? Are you Sauron?

28:41.791 --> 28:43.583
I have many names.

28:55.250 --> 28:59.333
What is yours, <i>Uruk?</i>

29:01.000 --> 29:03.250
[gasps]

29:06.041 --> 29:07.958
[birds chirping]

29:11.708 --> 29:13.625
[indistinct chatter]

29:31.625 --> 29:34.958
Ill fortune... to pack a dagger in a bag.

29:36.708 --> 29:38.500
Say it cuts a journey short.

29:40.416 --> 29:42.208
This one's already stabbed me once.

29:44.375 --> 29:46.041
I'd wager the damage is done.

29:54.791 --> 29:56.041
How do you live with it?

29:57.333 --> 29:58.958
Had a good healer stitch me up.

30:03.458 --> 30:05.666
I meant, 'bout your mum.

30:08.625 --> 30:09.875
I heard what you said.

30:10.708 --> 30:12.583
About it being your fault and all.

30:14.125 --> 30:15.958
I wanted to know how you carry it.

30:19.791 --> 30:20.875
Poorly.

30:23.291 --> 30:24.916
I've carried it poorly.

30:24.916 --> 30:27.083
I didn't realize that until I came here.

30:27.083 --> 30:28.416
Why?

30:29.333 --> 30:31.750
Seems there's grander things here
than I thought.

30:33.250 --> 30:35.583
Enough to make me realize
how small I'd become.

30:37.125 --> 30:38.125
[man] Come help me!

30:41.166 --> 30:42.541
[sighs]

30:42.541 --> 30:44.875
Better start helping them unload.

30:44.875 --> 30:46.500
Sure you won't come with me?

30:46.916 --> 30:47.916
[chuckles]

30:48.666 --> 30:50.666
Like it better being a low man.

30:51.583 --> 30:52.583
[chuckles]

30:53.083 --> 30:54.375
I liked it too.

31:33.833 --> 31:35.375
Change your mind?

31:39.708 --> 31:41.458
To replace the ones Theo lent me.

31:43.041 --> 31:45.833
You can, uh, set it up there.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.166
I hear you're building a home.

32:02.791 --> 32:05.833
Hagen started laying the foundation
a few days ago.

32:07.666 --> 32:09.583
When he laid the cornerstone...

32:11.541 --> 32:16.166
he asked the gods to keep our love strong,
as long as the home stood.

32:17.833 --> 32:19.250
I'm happy for you.

32:21.708 --> 32:24.791
I always thought his kindness
was what love felt like.

32:28.125 --> 32:29.916
But when he said it, I felt ill.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.000
I felt like...

32:39.166 --> 32:40.541
Why are you telling me this?

32:44.750 --> 32:45.833
I...

33:07.041 --> 33:08.458
Come with me.

33:10.833 --> 33:12.250
Come with me to Númenor.

33:20.541 --> 33:23.458
Low men of Pelargir. Salutations.

33:23.458 --> 33:25.916
I'm Theo. Son of Bronwyn.

33:25.916 --> 33:27.666
Bring the surveyor's equipment.

33:27.666 --> 33:29.041
Perhaps you didn't hear.

33:29.875 --> 33:33.166
This is Theo. His mother was Bronwyn.

33:33.166 --> 33:35.583
Of course she was. And who are you?

33:36.208 --> 33:37.708
He's the leader of half the colony.

33:37.708 --> 33:40.583
Here to help me uphold the agreement
we made with your Queen.

33:40.583 --> 33:42.125
Agreement's changed.

33:42.958 --> 33:45.083
We'll build the watchtower
in sight of the river.

33:45.083 --> 33:46.916
Fell a few houses if we need to.

33:47.833 --> 33:49.791
It's a disgrace,
the state this place is in.

33:50.500 --> 33:51.750
Is that Kemen?

33:55.416 --> 33:56.625
Isildur?

33:59.500 --> 34:02.791
Your sister will be so pleased
to hear we found you.

34:06.708 --> 34:11.250
I never gave up hope, even when everyone
said there were no survivors left.

34:11.916 --> 34:14.583
There wouldn't be, if not for Berek.

34:19.166 --> 34:20.583
I trust there's room on the ship.

34:20.583 --> 34:22.000
Plenty.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.750
Then one more should be no trouble.

34:38.458 --> 34:40.208
No passage for low men.

34:42.458 --> 34:45.875
I survived an eruption.
My sister's a guild member.

34:45.875 --> 34:48.500
My father,
Post-Captain to Queen-regent Míriel.

34:50.333 --> 34:51.791
Surely an exception can be made.

34:51.791 --> 34:53.500
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

34:53.500 --> 34:55.291
My father is now King.

34:55.291 --> 34:58.916
And yours... is wanted for treason.

35:01.041 --> 35:02.416
It might've been worse.

35:02.416 --> 35:04.958
If I'd had it my way,
the old fool'd be dead.

35:05.250 --> 35:06.791
- [grunts]
- [clamoring]

35:06.791 --> 35:08.625
I saved your life, you miserable--

35:08.625 --> 35:10.708
Shall I have them slaughter the horse?

35:11.666 --> 35:13.500
These people do look hungry.

35:16.166 --> 35:17.166
[sighs]

35:21.625 --> 35:25.750
Disrespect me again, and you really
will be lost to Middle-earth.

35:28.666 --> 35:29.916
Hear this now.

35:31.000 --> 35:36.083
Pelargir is no longer a colony of Númenor
but a fortress for its soldiers.

35:36.083 --> 35:37.750
And I am its Commander.

35:37.750 --> 35:40.000
Any low man wishing to remain here

35:40.000 --> 35:43.583
will deliver a regular allotment of timber
from the surrounding forests

35:43.583 --> 35:46.291
for the construction
of His Majesty's armada.

35:46.291 --> 35:49.458
What about the supplies you promised?
The food for winter?

35:49.458 --> 35:51.708
No timber, no supplies.

35:51.708 --> 35:56.375
But I'm certain that won't be a problem
for you. After all, they're only trees.

36:05.958 --> 36:08.041
- [wind whooshing]
- [birds chirping]

36:11.958 --> 36:13.958
[leaves rustling]

36:27.750 --> 36:29.791
She-Elf turned herself in.

36:31.291 --> 36:32.625
[Adar] Leave us.

36:34.583 --> 36:35.666
Leave us.

36:41.416 --> 36:43.250
I accept your terms, <i>Uruk.</i>

36:45.125 --> 36:46.791
I have what Sauron seeks.

36:47.750 --> 36:51.500
End this slaughter
and I will do as you asked.

36:52.125 --> 36:54.208
I will help you destroy him.

36:54.833 --> 36:58.875
[Adar] How do you expect to destroy Sauron
without your Ring?

37:04.541 --> 37:09.125
It would seem,
even wounds that have endured an age,

37:09.791 --> 37:11.875
can sometimes yet be healed.

37:17.125 --> 37:18.375
Adar.

37:18.375 --> 37:22.916
When last I looked like this,
I was known by another name.

37:23.875 --> 37:25.166
What was it?

37:26.666 --> 37:30.291
A meaningless name. A name I was given.

37:34.625 --> 37:37.125
Adar is the name I earned.

37:45.916 --> 37:47.583
Help me earn it back.

37:48.875 --> 37:51.083
[Nenya chiming]

37:57.875 --> 37:58.875
Take it.

38:00.208 --> 38:02.333
Help me vanquish Sauron with it.

38:03.708 --> 38:09.333
And I swear to you,
I will recall my children to Mordor.

38:09.958 --> 38:12.833
Never to make war on Middle-earth again.

38:14.125 --> 38:19.166
I have slain more of your children
than any Elf alive.

38:20.041 --> 38:22.041
[in Sindarin] I forgive you.

38:23.791 --> 38:26.958
[in English] No more flames,
and no more darkness.

38:27.708 --> 38:30.750
Let this Ring heal the rift
between Elf and <i>Uruk.</i>

38:30.750 --> 38:32.833
[Nenya chiming]

38:34.291 --> 38:37.541
Let us create a lasting peace
in Middle-earth.

38:37.541 --> 38:39.041
Now and forever.

39:05.208 --> 39:08.083
[Glüg groaning]

39:09.875 --> 39:10.833
What happened?

39:10.833 --> 39:13.500
We found Sauron, Lord-father.

39:13.500 --> 39:17.375
He tried to make Glüg betray you,
but he resisted.

39:17.375 --> 39:19.291
So Sauron did this.

39:20.208 --> 39:22.750
The others are pursuing him now.

39:22.750 --> 39:24.333
[Adar] Forgive me, child.

39:24.750 --> 39:26.416
[Glüg groaning]

39:26.416 --> 39:27.833
It's too late.

39:28.375 --> 39:29.958
It is never too late.

39:31.208 --> 39:33.083
Not even for me.

39:33.083 --> 39:35.208
And not for you, my son.

39:35.208 --> 39:37.291
[gasping]

39:39.500 --> 39:40.916
It's too late.

39:41.958 --> 39:43.750
[groaning]

39:45.250 --> 39:47.208
[groaning]

39:48.750 --> 39:51.666
[gasping]

39:51.666 --> 39:54.458
[Orcs shouting]

39:54.875 --> 39:56.916
[Adar groaning]

40:16.541 --> 40:17.708
Galadriel.

40:17.708 --> 40:18.958
[gasping]

40:30.000 --> 40:31.916
- [Orcs shouting]
- [Adar groaning]

40:38.625 --> 40:40.625
[melancholic music playing]

40:55.291 --> 40:58.041
[in Black Speech] My... children...

40:58.041 --> 41:00.125
[in English]
They are not children anymore.

41:01.416 --> 41:03.708
[speaks Black Speech]

41:13.666 --> 41:15.666
[shouting]

41:24.083 --> 41:27.916
[in English] What orders, Lord Sauron?

41:29.291 --> 41:30.750
Raze Eregion.

41:32.333 --> 41:34.000
Leave no Elf alive.

41:34.000 --> 41:35.333
[gasping]

41:35.333 --> 41:37.000
But bring me their leaders.

41:38.541 --> 41:40.333
[Glüg, in Black Speech] Hail Sauron!

41:40.333 --> 41:43.541
- Hail the new Dark Lord!
- [Orc repeating in Black Speech]

41:43.541 --> 41:45.000
Hail Lord Sauron!

41:48.083 --> 41:50.916
Hail Lord Sauron!

41:50.916 --> 41:52.625
[Orcs repeating in Black Speech]

41:53.833 --> 41:55.125
[in English] All this...

41:57.000 --> 41:59.000
was your design from the beginning.

41:59.666 --> 42:04.166
Please. You think too much of me.

42:06.291 --> 42:10.000
The road goes ever winding.

42:10.500 --> 42:13.458
Not even I can see all its paths.

42:25.250 --> 42:27.208
[Nenya chiming]

42:27.208 --> 42:30.458
It is even more beautiful
than Celebrimbor led me to believe.

42:38.541 --> 42:39.541
Give it to me.

42:39.541 --> 42:41.416
[grunting]

42:43.833 --> 42:46.750
Give me your Ring... and the Nine.

42:47.750 --> 42:49.666
It is not my wish to harm you.

42:49.666 --> 42:51.458
Do you wish to heal me?

42:52.375 --> 42:56.500
I wish to heal... all Middle-earth.

42:56.500 --> 42:58.416
As you have Eregion?

42:59.166 --> 43:02.375
[both grunting]

43:07.666 --> 43:08.750
[gasps]

43:21.125 --> 43:22.416
[grunting]

43:28.333 --> 43:29.625
[Orc] Bring it down.

43:29.625 --> 43:32.333
[Orcs shouting]

43:33.458 --> 43:34.958
And pull!

43:36.750 --> 43:38.583
[Orcs cheering]

43:50.875 --> 43:51.916
- No, <i>Uruk!</i>
- No!

43:51.916 --> 43:54.625
That is the full record
of Celebrimbor's works.

43:54.625 --> 43:57.000
The wisdom of all
who ever dwelt in this place.

43:58.166 --> 44:01.458
Its value is beyond jewels or even blood.

44:01.958 --> 44:04.875
Take our lives.
But leave it be, I beg you.

44:05.750 --> 44:07.333
[laughing]

44:09.208 --> 44:10.875
Cowardly traitors!

44:11.916 --> 44:13.625
[grunting]

44:17.041 --> 44:19.166
[grunting]

44:23.041 --> 44:26.500
- [shouting]
- [screaming]

44:29.000 --> 44:30.291
[Orc] Wait!

44:30.291 --> 44:33.291
Lord Sauron wanted their leaders unharmed.

44:34.958 --> 44:36.458
[grunting]

44:54.666 --> 44:55.666
[groans]

45:16.333 --> 45:17.375
Galadriel,

45:18.916 --> 45:22.708
surely you of all Elves must understand

45:22.708 --> 45:27.375
that to find the light,
we must first touch the darkness.

45:30.291 --> 45:32.875
We are not alike. We never were.

45:32.875 --> 45:34.958
It was just another of your illusions.

45:36.375 --> 45:37.666
Not all of it.

46:06.250 --> 46:07.583
Fighting at your side,

46:08.708 --> 46:11.333
I felt, if I could just hold on
to that feeling.

46:26.541 --> 46:30.291
They could no longer distinguish me
from the evil I was fighting.

46:35.958 --> 46:37.416
[grunting]

46:47.041 --> 46:49.125
Are they not the seeds you planted?

46:49.583 --> 46:50.458
[gasps]

46:53.125 --> 46:54.166
[groans]

46:56.458 --> 46:57.625
[panting]

47:09.583 --> 47:10.625
[groans]

47:16.708 --> 47:17.916
I see you.

47:19.291 --> 47:21.083
[groaning]

47:28.416 --> 47:29.833
I know your mind.

47:30.250 --> 47:31.791
[shuddering]

47:37.583 --> 47:39.041
The door is still open.

47:42.458 --> 47:44.000
The door is shut.

47:44.541 --> 47:45.708
[groans]

47:52.875 --> 47:54.208
[shouting]

48:20.333 --> 48:21.458
[grunting]

48:22.291 --> 48:23.416
[groans]

48:23.416 --> 48:25.083
[shuddering]

48:29.416 --> 48:31.458
[groaning]

48:33.291 --> 48:34.625
[shuddering]

48:34.625 --> 48:37.083
I would have placed a crown
upon your head.

48:38.666 --> 48:40.875
I would never have rested

48:40.875 --> 48:44.166
until all Middle-earth
had been brought to its knees,

48:46.375 --> 48:48.833
to worship the light of its Queen.

48:48.833 --> 48:50.208
[groans]

48:51.250 --> 48:52.708
[Galadriel gasping]

48:54.083 --> 48:57.708
The free peoples of Middle-earth

48:59.166 --> 49:03.166
will always resist you.

49:03.166 --> 49:04.375
[groans]

49:05.708 --> 49:08.500
[gasping]

49:13.041 --> 49:14.791
[breathing heavily]

49:22.958 --> 49:23.833
[sword clatters]

49:32.083 --> 49:35.166
[Galadriel breathing raggedly]

49:35.166 --> 49:36.666
The Rings are mine.

49:38.083 --> 49:41.916
[horn bellows]

49:44.500 --> 49:48.750
[horn bellows]

49:51.708 --> 49:52.958
Dwarves.

49:52.958 --> 49:54.000
[groans]

49:58.000 --> 49:59.333
[groans]

49:59.541 --> 50:02.708
[grunting]

50:10.125 --> 50:11.291
[Dwarf] Come on. Get off me.

50:11.291 --> 50:12.500
Durin.

50:15.000 --> 50:16.000
[Elf woman] No!

50:16.833 --> 50:19.125
The Prince is in mourning.

50:21.250 --> 50:22.458
[Orc] Move it!

50:25.500 --> 50:27.041
[Sauron] Give me your Ring.

50:33.791 --> 50:35.375
[shuddering]

50:43.708 --> 50:48.000
Galadriel. Your Ring.

51:09.750 --> 51:13.250
You wish to heal Middle-earth?

51:18.083 --> 51:19.458
Heal yourself.

51:19.458 --> 51:21.958
[dramatic music playing]

51:29.666 --> 51:30.500
[grunts]

51:50.208 --> 51:52.416
We are overwhelmed, Lord Sauron.

51:52.416 --> 51:55.125
The Dwarves are securing
the Elves' retreat.

51:55.125 --> 51:57.458
If we pursue, many <i>Uruks</i>-- [groans]

51:58.333 --> 52:00.291
[choking]

52:07.041 --> 52:09.000
[groans]

52:14.166 --> 52:16.166
- [wind blowing]
- [birds cawing]

52:40.750 --> 52:44.166
These are not merely wounds of the body.

52:45.208 --> 52:49.791
Her very immortal spirit is being drawn
into the shadow realm.

52:51.958 --> 52:57.958
[in Quenya]
Galadriel: by the light of the Elder King,

52:58.666 --> 53:02.375
I command all darkness
to depart from thee...

53:02.375 --> 53:05.166
[chiming]

53:14.791 --> 53:16.916
By the light of the Elder King,

53:16.916 --> 53:20.291
I command all darkness
to depart from thee...

53:23.375 --> 53:24.791
[in English] We're losing her.

53:25.458 --> 53:28.625
The darkness is too powerful.
I cannot save her.

53:30.875 --> 53:34.083
[chiming]

53:35.625 --> 53:36.750
I can.

53:43.375 --> 53:44.541
We can.

54:03.958 --> 54:07.125
[chiming]

54:14.125 --> 54:16.125
[indistinct chatter]

54:20.958 --> 54:22.250
[birds chirping]

54:44.083 --> 54:45.416
We'll have to fix it.

54:50.125 --> 54:51.458
After my family...

54:57.041 --> 54:58.791
Mr. Burrows sat me down.

55:00.916 --> 55:03.000
Told me, "Some things can't be fixed.

55:05.416 --> 55:10.833
"Some things lost are lost forever.

55:25.375 --> 55:28.208
<i>"No matter how hard we fight...</i>

55:41.500 --> 55:43.333
<i>"How much it hurts...</i>

55:50.041 --> 55:52.666
<i>"Or how much our hearts yearn...</i>

56:00.708 --> 56:02.708
<i>"To put them back together...</i>

56:09.250 --> 56:12.250
<i>"'Cause this world's so much bigger
than any of us.</i>

56:26.208 --> 56:29.833
<i>"And sometimes the winds blowin'
against us are just too strong.</i>

56:36.833 --> 56:38.916
<i>"At those times," Mr. Burrows said,</i>

56:42.375 --> 56:43.958
<i>"we've just got to accept it.</i>

56:47.875 --> 56:50.625
<i>"What's broke is broke and won't fix.</i>

56:55.500 --> 57:00.916
<i>"And all anybody can do is try
and build something new."</i>

57:18.750 --> 57:20.875
Don't be a stranger now.

57:25.458 --> 57:27.125
Thank you kindly, Grand-Elf.

57:28.166 --> 57:29.291
Huh.

57:31.791 --> 57:33.875
[woman] Why don't you grab something else?

57:39.458 --> 57:40.791
Goodbye, Grand-Elf.

57:47.458 --> 57:48.458
Grandelf?

57:50.375 --> 57:52.083
[Nori] They've never seen an Elf before.

57:52.916 --> 57:54.416
Never even left home before.

57:55.000 --> 57:57.750
Right. I tried to help 'em pack, but...

57:58.750 --> 58:00.833
it's their first migration,

58:00.833 --> 58:03.291
and they haven't the foggiest
what to bring.

58:05.833 --> 58:07.416
And what to leave.

58:14.208 --> 58:15.791
If I had my druthers, we...

58:20.041 --> 58:22.000
We'd walk the wastes of this world.

58:24.333 --> 58:27.791
Eatin' snails and beetles
till the sun run out of days,

58:27.791 --> 58:33.000
but it's high time I walked my path,
and you walked yours.

58:37.291 --> 58:39.916
We are very different creatures, Nori.

58:41.416 --> 58:42.958
When all is said and done.

58:45.375 --> 58:47.375
Not so different at all, if you ask me.

59:04.416 --> 59:06.416
[dramatic music playing]

01:00:35.208 --> 01:00:37.625
It was all a test, wasn't it?

01:00:38.750 --> 01:00:40.333
Another one of your riddles.

01:00:41.625 --> 01:00:44.750
I was meant
to choose friendship over power.

01:00:46.208 --> 01:00:47.750
I was meant to help them.

01:00:48.958 --> 01:00:51.958
I was meant to find this.

01:00:57.166 --> 01:00:59.291
A wizard does not find his staff.

01:01:01.041 --> 01:01:02.791
It finds him.

01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:08.875
Like his name.

01:01:22.541 --> 01:01:23.958
Gandalf.

01:01:28.083 --> 01:01:30.416
That's what they're going to call me,
isn't it?

01:01:32.333 --> 01:01:34.541
Now let the song begin.

01:01:37.958 --> 01:01:39.583
Let us sing together.

01:01:41.041 --> 01:01:44.083
[singing] <i>Merry dol derry dol
Ring a ding dillo</i>

01:01:44.666 --> 01:01:50.041
<i>Sandflies in the grass
Bees around the willow</i>

01:01:50.041 --> 01:01:52.291
<i>Now let the song begin</i>

01:01:52.291 --> 01:01:54.166
[both] <i>Let us sing together</i>

01:01:54.833 --> 01:02:00.416
<i>Of sun, stars, moon and mist,
Rain and cloudy weather</i>

01:02:00.416 --> 01:02:05.500
<i>Light on the budding leaf
Dew on the feather</i>

01:02:05.500 --> 01:02:10.541
<i>Wind on the open hills
Bells on the heather</i>

01:02:11.333 --> 01:02:16.375
<i>Old Tom Bombadil
Is a merry fellow</i>

01:02:16.375 --> 01:02:21.250
<i>Bright blue his jacket is
And his boots are yellow</i>

01:02:21.958 --> 01:02:27.041
<i>Reeds by the shady pool
Lilies on the water</i>

01:02:27.666 --> 01:02:32.875
<i>Old Tom Bombadil
And the River-daughter</i>

01:03:04.625 --> 01:03:06.041
[Narvi] Eregion has fallen.

01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:10.916
The survivors have fled
to a valley North of here.

01:03:12.541 --> 01:03:13.958
And Elrond?

01:03:13.958 --> 01:03:15.208
He led them.

01:03:18.291 --> 01:03:19.708
Dispatch word.

01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:25.083
Tell him, Khazad-dûm stands ready
to offer aid once more.

01:03:25.833 --> 01:03:28.416
We have troubles of our own, my love.

01:03:31.083 --> 01:03:34.958
Your father's passing
has left us in a tangle.

01:03:36.416 --> 01:03:40.250
The Lords of the Blue Mountains
paid him vast tributes

01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:43.291
and they're demanding to collect.

01:03:43.291 --> 01:03:44.958
But there's more.

01:03:44.958 --> 01:03:49.250
Rumors fly that you were
not your father's preferred heir.

01:03:49.916 --> 01:03:53.500
That some of the other Dwarf-lords
are advancing claims.

01:03:54.875 --> 01:03:58.916
And, um, your brother
seems to be gathering support.

01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:13.541
[Galadriel shuddering]

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.416
[wind whooshing]

01:04:15.416 --> 01:04:17.166
[birds chirping]

01:04:17.791 --> 01:04:19.375
[gasping]

01:04:22.291 --> 01:04:23.500
[Gil-galad] Pity.

01:04:24.166 --> 01:04:27.125
I've never known you
to be such peaceable company.

01:04:27.125 --> 01:04:30.291
I believe I was growing accustomed to it.

01:04:31.125 --> 01:04:32.583
[groans]

01:04:36.833 --> 01:04:38.000
Rest.

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:40.541
We are safe here.

01:04:46.958 --> 01:04:50.583
- What is this place?
- [Elrond] A sanctuary.

01:04:51.333 --> 01:04:56.291
Protected... by the Elven Rings.

01:05:07.875 --> 01:05:08.916
[sighs]

01:05:21.875 --> 01:05:22.958
Commander.

01:05:23.708 --> 01:05:24.791
Arondir.

01:05:29.416 --> 01:05:32.708
I have gathered the others, High King.
They await your decision.

01:05:37.125 --> 01:05:40.583
Sauron's armies are roving across Eriador.

01:05:41.791 --> 01:05:45.166
All Middle-earth is within his reach now.
Even Lindon.

01:05:46.250 --> 01:05:50.791
We must decide whether to attack
and bring the fight to him...

01:05:51.666 --> 01:05:54.583
or to fall back, to prepare our defenses.

01:05:57.250 --> 01:05:58.750
The sword or the shield.

01:06:01.125 --> 01:06:03.541
[Elrond] Many of Eregion's bravest fell.

01:06:03.541 --> 01:06:06.916
The few who survived are all but broken.
In body or spirit.

01:06:06.916 --> 01:06:09.708
They have little strength left
with which to fight.

01:06:10.250 --> 01:06:12.125
They barely had strength to flee.

01:06:14.583 --> 01:06:17.208
What course would you advise,
Commander Galadriel?

01:06:20.541 --> 01:06:21.708
[sighs]

01:06:29.833 --> 01:06:31.750
I would remember the counsel

01:06:33.041 --> 01:06:37.125
of our dear friend, Celebrimbor,

01:06:38.833 --> 01:06:41.083
<i>Greatest of Elven-smiths.</i>

01:06:45.583 --> 01:06:47.333
<i>And remind our people...</i>

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.375
<i>that it is not strength
that overcomes darkness,</i>

01:06:53.375 --> 01:06:54.750
<i>but light.</i>

01:07:05.875 --> 01:07:06.916
[gasps]

01:07:07.666 --> 01:07:10.083
And the sun yet shines.

01:07:15.541 --> 01:07:18.083
[indistinct chatter]

01:08:00.875 --> 01:08:02.750
[blade swishes]

01:08:03.875 --> 01:08:06.500
[crowd cheering]
