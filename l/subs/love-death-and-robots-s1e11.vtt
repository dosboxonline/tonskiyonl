Appreciate the company, Bill.

01:09.255 --> 01:12.213
These solo jobs tweak my nerves.

01:12.297 --> 01:14.755
[Bill] <i>God damn company penny pinchers,</i>
<i>am I right?</i>

01:14.838 --> 01:16.547
Why pay two when one'll do?

01:16.880 --> 01:18.088
Prepping EVA.

[Bill] <i>Anthem. This is Jockey Mother.</i>
<i>Alex, what the hell's going on out there?</i>

03:07.588 --> 03:10.630
I'm fucked. Impact on my mobility unit.

03:10.713 --> 03:13.463
It went non-functional
and the backup's damaged as well.

03:30.963 --> 03:32.047
Listen, Bill.

03:33.172 --> 03:34.463
That impact...

03:35.755 --> 03:38.297
Well, it looks like it damaged
my oxygen tanks too.

03:40.672 --> 03:42.505
The rescue team's
not gonna make it in time.

03:42.588 --> 03:44.672
-[Bill] <i>Now, just hold on a second--</i>
-No.

03:45.547 --> 03:47.380
Math's come in. I'm done.

03:51.505 --> 03:53.130
Just do me a favor, okay?

03:53.797 --> 03:57.297
Next time the suits come calling, would
you kick them in the bollocks for me?

03:57.380 --> 03:58.713
[Bill] <i>Now, Alex, just wait--</i>

03:58.797 --> 03:59.755

[panting]

07:46.047 --> 07:47.463
[coughing]

07:48.005 --> 07:49.547
[Alex] Anthem to Jockey Mother.

07:52.547 --> 07:53.588
You read?

07:54.672 --> 07:56.547
[Bill] <i>Jesus, Alex. Thank God.</i>

07:57.005 --> 07:58.422
<i>We thought you were dead.</i>

07:58.922 --> 08:00.255
<i>What happened?</i>

08:00.338 --> 08:03.130
I had to make a wee sacrifice
to the great nothing.

08:05.213 --> 08:06.672
But I'm still breathing.

08:06.922 --> 08:09.797
[Bill] <i>Well, thank the fucking Lord.</i>

08:11.005 --> 08:12.172
<i>So, you still need a hand?</i>

08:13.047 --> 08:14.172
[laughs]

08:15.297 --> 08:16.713
Funny you should ask...

08:19.088 --> 08:20.672
but I got things under control.

08:23.255 --> 08:25.255
Just get a few beers chillin', Bill.

08:27.088 --> 08:28.380
[Alex] <i>I'll be home soon.</i>
