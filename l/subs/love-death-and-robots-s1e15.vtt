00:45.588 --> 00:48.172
Five minutes to objective.
Stay sharp, metalheads.

00:48.255 --> 00:50.672
Copy that! Countdown to mayhem.

00:50.755 --> 00:52.880
-We gonna let Rookie in on this?
-Depends.

00:52.963 --> 00:56.255
-Hey, Rookie, your balls dropped yet?
-What?

00:56.338 --> 00:58.255
Fuck you, Sui. I'm ready.

00:58.338 --> 01:01.797
You'll get your chance, boy, don't worry.
We on schedule, Bob?

01:01.880 --> 01:04.588
[Bob the Robot] Affirmative.
It appears the cargo is in the front car.

01:04.672 --> 01:06.838
Hey, Hawk, what are we stealing, anyway?

01:06.922 --> 01:08.338
It's a microchip, kid.

01:08.422 --> 01:10.922
[Hawk] <i>Wanna know what that </i>
<i>looks like? Your head's full of 'em.</i>

01:11.005 --> 01:13.380
[Bob] Don't forget
to look out for guards in the rear car.

01:13.463 --> 01:15.713
[thumping electronic music plays]

01:18.755 --> 01:20.922
[Hawk] Contact. 
Move up and match velocity.

01:21.005 --> 01:21.880
In position.

01:21.963 --> 01:23.338
I got a position for you.

01:23.422 --> 01:26.338
Really? Does it involve shoving my gun

01:26.422 --> 01:28.172
-up your ass?
-[laughs]

01:28.255 --> 01:30.005
<i>-</i>[Hawk] <i>We good to go, Bob?</i>
-[Bob] Roger that.

01:30.088 --> 01:31.547
The target is in the blind spot.

01:31.630 --> 01:34.047
You got till it reaches
the other side of the tunnel to get in,

01:34.130 --> 01:36.047
-make the grab and get out.
-Move out.

01:38.005 --> 01:41.338
Sui, Rookie, plant the magnetic mines
on the guard car.

01:41.422 --> 01:43.172
[sarcastically] Great idea, boss.

01:43.255 --> 01:46.338
Give the high explosives to the lunatic
and the new guy.

01:46.422 --> 01:47.838
What could go wrong?

01:47.963 --> 01:50.422
Ah, shut your grease trap. I got this.

01:59.047 --> 02:00.547
[Sui] Last one.

-What the fuck was that explosion?
-Hate to say I told you so.

02:22.338 --> 02:23.922
Give us some covering fire, Kali.

02:29.088 --> 02:30.422
On the roof!

02:31.255 --> 02:32.255
[groans]

02:32.922 --> 02:33.922
That does it.

02:34.005 --> 02:36.005
[Kali] Wait! Just blow the mines...

02:36.088 --> 02:38.088
-[roars]
-...you suicidal fuck.

02:40.338 --> 02:43.505
We're almost at the tunnel.
We need to blow those mines now!

02:44.047 --> 02:45.630
Sui's not... clear.

02:45.713 --> 02:46.880
[Sui] Don't worry about me.

02:48.088 --> 02:49.047
Do it, Hawk!

02:49.130 --> 02:50.088
[beeps]

03:02.797 --> 03:03.630
Whoa!

03:03.713 --> 03:05.588
Well, that wasn't so...

03:06.213 --> 03:07.130
hard.

03:08.547 --> 03:09.380
Hawk!

03:09.880 --> 03:12.213
[Bob] Shit, did I mention 
the automatic guns?

03:12.713 --> 03:13.797
[engine roars]

03:19.922 --> 03:21.922
No, Bob, you didn't.

03:23.547 --> 03:25.088
Okay, let's pick it up.

03:25.172 --> 03:28.505
If this truck makes it through
that tunnel, we are all fucked.

03:29.547 --> 03:31.838
[Sui] Rookie, get your lug-nuts up here.

03:32.963 --> 03:36.005
[Bob] Uh, wait a second.
I'm getting a new energy reading.

03:36.088 --> 03:37.047
Oh, shit.

03:37.422 --> 03:41.588
Uh, fellas? I think Bob missed 
another detail about the defenses.

03:42.005 --> 03:43.797
What do you mean, Kali? I don't--

03:47.963 --> 03:49.255
Holy fucking shit! 

03:49.338 --> 03:51.755
Hey, that was my friend
you just dismantled,

03:51.838 --> 03:53.672
you giant walking dildo.

[menacing music plays]

04:02.505 --> 04:04.422
Rookie, get below deck now.

04:09.338 --> 04:10.547
Ohh.  

04:11.047 --> 04:13.380
Looks like this is your stop, big guy.

04:25.088 --> 04:26.130
Huh?  

04:27.130 --> 04:28.463
Kali, look out!

04:34.588 --> 04:35.422
Kali!  

04:36.005 --> 04:37.672
[shouts] Fucker!

04:40.130 --> 04:41.422
[Bob] It's too heavily armored.

04:41.505 --> 04:44.255
You'll have to get inside
and take out the defense CPU.

04:45.047 --> 04:46.922
Rookie, blow its brains out.

04:47.797 --> 04:49.755
-Copy that.

[Sui] Come on! You little pussy!

05:11.297 --> 05:14.172
God damn it, Rookie!
What are you waiting for?

05:14.255 --> 05:16.172
Destroy this fucker's CPU.

06:42.005 --> 06:44.088
Mission accomplished, I guess.

06:44.963 --> 06:46.422
I've got the chip, but...

06:47.005 --> 06:47.963
everyone else...

06:48.838 --> 06:52.380
[chuckling] Don't worry, kid.
I cried my first time too.

06:52.463 --> 06:54.380
Sui? What?

06:54.463 --> 06:57.963
Bob always makes a full backup of
our brains before each mission.

06:58.047 --> 07:03.047
And Sui's brains, well, they don't take
too much space on the old hard drive.

07:03.130 --> 07:04.588
I thought you were all dead.

07:05.047 --> 07:08.755
You should have read your contract, kid.
Now come on, let's get outta here.
