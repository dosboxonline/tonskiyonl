[bottles clinking]

00:44.922 --> 00:48.047
Hey, where do you want the wine?

00:48.672 --> 00:49.838
[woman] In here, please.

00:50.422 --> 00:53.172
Can you believe the landlord left
that funky refrigerator in here?

00:53.297 --> 00:54.297
[laughs]

00:55.213 --> 00:57.005
You know, these old-timey fridges,

00:57.797 --> 00:59.755
they're actually, like, really smart.

00:59.838 --> 01:02.588
In modern refrigerators,
they don't have one of these, you know.

01:02.672 --> 01:04.463
The motor's underneath...

01:04.797 --> 01:07.630
so the hot air rises up into the fridge

01:07.713 --> 01:10.505
and has to be pumped out
by the same motor that produced it.

01:10.588 --> 01:12.380
I mean, it's, like, crazy.

01:12.713 --> 01:14.338
Yeah, that's insane.

01:15.630 --> 01:17.505
Hey, want some?

01:18.172 --> 01:19.838
Oh, yeah. You know what?

01:20.088 --> 01:21.755
There might be some ice in here.

01:21.838 --> 01:24.672
[woman] You know what I love about you?
Your class.

01:24.755 --> 01:27.838
It's like a fucking Fortress of Solitude.

[ice rattles in glass]

01:34.713 --> 01:37.713
-To all the sex we're gonna have--
-To all the good times...

01:37.797 --> 01:39.672
-What I meant to say.
-...we're gonna have...

01:39.755 --> 01:40.880
-in our new place.
-Yeah.

[whimsical fantasy music plays]

01:51.005 --> 01:52.755
-What the hell?
-What is it?

01:54.047 --> 01:59.255
Gail, I want you to look inside this
ice cube and tell me what you see.

02:04.338 --> 02:05.172
Is that...

02:06.505 --> 02:07.380
[gasps]

02:07.797 --> 02:09.922
I think I have
a magnifying glass somewhere.

02:17.213 --> 02:19.672
-[Gail] Are those spears in its side?
-[man] What?

02:21.463 --> 02:23.713
I wonder if there's more of these things
in the freezer.

02:35.505 --> 02:36.505
Oh, my God.

02:42.297 --> 02:43.380
Holy shit!

02:45.297 --> 02:47.672
There's a lost civilization
in our refrigerator.

02:48.422 --> 02:49.255
[Gail] Uh-huh.

[ethereal electronic music plays]

03:19.880 --> 03:21.505
This makes no sense.

03:22.672 --> 03:24.047
-You think?
-Yeah.

03:24.505 --> 03:26.463
That's clearly an early medieval city.

03:27.047 --> 03:27.880
Yeah?

03:27.963 --> 03:29.963
[sighs]  I mean, come on, everyone knows

03:30.047 --> 03:33.047
that woolly mammoths died out 
some time in the late Neolithic period.

03:34.588 --> 03:36.838
Yeah, everyone knows that.

03:43.422 --> 03:44.547
[sighs]

03:45.672 --> 03:47.047
[Gail sighs]

03:49.047 --> 03:50.922
Well, it'll make good fertilizer?

03:51.713 --> 03:52.755
[sighs] Too soon.

03:58.755 --> 04:00.005
[Gail] Let's check again.

04:01.005 --> 04:04.713
Damn! We only looked away,
like, ten minutes.

04:04.797 --> 04:06.838
[Gail] The time rate in there 
must be different.

04:06.922 --> 04:08.255
Decades have gone by.

04:08.338 --> 04:10.297
It's the Industrial Revolution already.

04:10.422 --> 04:13.255
-Aww, we missed the Renaissance.
-Oh, bummer.

04:14.380 --> 04:15.838
[Rob] I wonder if we're their gods?

04:16.505 --> 04:18.880
[man 1] Who are these two douchebags
starin' at us all day?

04:18.963 --> 04:22.213
[man 2] I don't know. I'm tired 
of looking at that broccoli in her teeth.

04:22.505 --> 04:23.880
Yeah, I doubt it.

04:24.172 --> 04:26.922
[whirring]

04:27.672 --> 04:28.880
[Rob] What's that?

04:29.380 --> 04:33.088
-Oh, I think those are airplanes.
-Huh.  

04:33.172 --> 04:35.422
Yeah, no, I think
they've reached the present.

04:35.505 --> 04:38.005
Oh, my God. Look at that!
They've got a Starbucks.

04:38.088 --> 04:40.672
-No way.
-Those really are everywhere.

04:41.588 --> 04:43.047
What's going on over there?  

04:43.588 --> 04:44.838
Oh, fuck!

04:45.255 --> 04:47.047
-Fuck!
-[Gail] Are you okay? 

04:47.130 --> 04:49.130
[Rob] It's like I'm blinded.

04:49.547 --> 04:51.505
-Are you okay?
-They're fighting a war in there!

04:51.588 --> 04:53.005
-[distant screaming]
-[Gail] Calm down.

04:53.255 --> 04:55.380
Tactical nukes are going off
in our refrigerator

04:55.463 --> 04:56.797

-Jeez.
-[distant gunfire and explosions]

05:17.380 --> 05:20.630
-It looks like it's escalating.
-[somber music plays]

05:20.922 --> 05:21.797
[sighs]

05:22.130 --> 05:24.880
We can't expect them to outgrow war
in a couple of minutes.

05:25.505 --> 05:27.088
So, what are we gonna do?

05:29.505 --> 05:30.630
Order out for pizza.

05:35.755 --> 05:37.213
It's been over an hour.

05:38.380 --> 05:41.172
Maybe they've had a chance to rebuild.

05:42.630 --> 05:43.463
Rob...

05:44.880 --> 05:47.005
we have to face the possibility
that they...

05:47.088 --> 05:48.005
[sighs]

05:49.672 --> 05:51.255
well, that they didn't make it.

05:51.505 --> 05:54.005
[sighs] Yeah.

05:59.838 --> 06:02.838
-Holy shit. They made it!
-[laughs] They did.

[futuristic music plays]

06:05.297 --> 06:06.797
Are those flying cars?

06:07.005 --> 06:09.963
It looks like the Emerald City,
only, you know, less emerald.

06:10.047 --> 06:10.922
Right. [laughs]

06:11.297 --> 06:12.547
It's beautiful.

06:13.255 --> 06:15.838
Okay, honestly,
that one looks a bit phallic, you know.

06:15.922 --> 06:17.255
Like a dildo, yeah.

06:18.713 --> 06:21.213
[Rob] I guess they went through
a little bit of a pyramid phase.

06:22.755 --> 06:24.588
-That's a lot of bridges.
-[laughs]

06:25.172 --> 06:26.672
-[Rob] Oh, boy.
-[Gail] Whoa.

06:27.588 --> 06:28.672
What? [laughs]

Yeah.

07:09.922 --> 07:11.672
Do you think they're coming back?

07:13.505 --> 07:14.838
No, I don't think so.
