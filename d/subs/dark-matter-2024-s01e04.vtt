WEBVTT

00:12.930 --> 00:14.556
Help me!

00:14.556 --> 00:16.600
- Time frame?
- Two minutes, 43 seconds.

00:16.600 --> 00:17.601
Fuck!

00:19.853 --> 00:21.355
Help me.

00:24.566 --> 00:25.651
Jesus.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.332
It's open!

00:41.583 --> 00:43.669
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm not letting him get away again.

00:43.669 --> 00:44.753
You have no idea what it's like--

00:44.753 --> 00:47.297
Doesn't matter!
There's nothing left for me in this world.

01:04.230 --> 01:07.150
- You think Leighton will come after us?
- Yes.

01:08.485 --> 01:11.280
Do you think your world
is behind one of these doors?

01:11.280 --> 01:12.531
In theory.

01:12.531 --> 01:14.032
So, how do we find it?

01:14.032 --> 01:15.576
I have no idea.

01:15.576 --> 01:20.747
Now, I've been counting,
and that's the 220th door we've passed.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.166
And they're about 12 feet apart.

01:24.751 --> 01:26.503
So, we've already gone half a mile.

01:26.503 --> 01:29.715
Yeah. Maybe we're in
some kind of liminal space.

01:29.715 --> 01:31.341
Liminal as in not real?

01:31.341 --> 01:34.469
No, it's real. It's very real.

01:34.469 --> 01:39.349
I think it's a manifestation of the mind
as it attempts to visually explain

01:39.349 --> 01:42.186
something our brains
haven't fully evolved to comprehend.

01:42.186 --> 01:44.521
- Superposition.
- Exactly.

01:44.521 --> 01:48.483
I think the corridor's
a cross-section of probable realities.

01:50.319 --> 01:52.029
Let's get out of here.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.655
See what we can learn.

01:54.239 --> 01:56.158
Make ourselves harder to find.

02:09.795 --> 02:11.089
Let me see that.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.179
Hey.

03:23.662 --> 03:25.038
What the fuck?

03:39.052 --> 03:40.179
Ash.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.879
Oh, my God.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.483
What happened here?

05:18.819 --> 05:20.237
I don't know.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.164
Holy shit.

05:51.435 --> 05:52.394
Let's go.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.310
Oh, God.

06:33.310 --> 06:34.728
Are you okay?

06:40.442 --> 06:42.694
What the fuck? Oh, fuck.

08:46.360 --> 08:49.154
This car kind of sucks, huh?

08:50.155 --> 08:52.407
Yeah. I mean, it's definitely not amazing.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.118
Maybe we'll have to do
something about that.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.872
- Don't slow down. No, accelerate.
- I-- You sure?

08:58.872 --> 09:00.832
Yeah. You can make it.

09:03.794 --> 09:06.046
Nice.

09:08.340 --> 09:09.967
- What?
- Nothing.

09:09.967 --> 09:14.054
You always tell me
to slow down for the intersection.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.682
Well, there's a lot of yellow in that red.

09:19.226 --> 09:22.020
So, how's 16 treating you so far?

09:23.647 --> 09:25.649
I don't know. Same as yesterday.

09:26.817 --> 09:29.820
I think it'll finally feel real
when I get my license, you know.

09:29.820 --> 09:31.321
Yeah. Celebrate.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.574
What are we gonna do tonight, huh?

09:34.324 --> 09:37.202
Probably just do the usual thing.

09:37.786 --> 09:39.496
You know, keep it simple.

09:42.708 --> 09:44.543
Listen, I want you to hear me, right?

09:44.543 --> 09:46.253
Today is still your day.

09:49.131 --> 09:50.132
Thanks.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.408
It's 50.

10:17.075 --> 10:18.327
Well, 48 now.

10:23.207 --> 10:24.541
GPS works.

10:24.541 --> 10:26.835
I guess the satellites are still orbiting.

10:30.839 --> 10:33.842
I think we're in the same location
as Velocity in my world.

10:35.552 --> 10:38.305
All right. So, the coordinates
of the box don't change--

10:38.305 --> 10:40.807
that makes sense--
but just the outside world.

10:41.517 --> 10:43.685
Yeah. Yes.

10:47.481 --> 10:48.857
Come on.

10:53.737 --> 10:55.239
What are you looking for?

10:55.239 --> 10:57.950
I'm looking for some means of control.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.285
There's only a door handle.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.371
It's just a box.

11:02.371 --> 11:03.455
This?

11:04.498 --> 11:06.333
What do you mean it's just a box?

11:06.333 --> 11:08.836
- How does it work?
- I don't know. You tell me.

11:09.419 --> 11:10.546
You built this thing.

11:11.213 --> 11:12.130
I'm sorry.

11:12.130 --> 11:15.634
You got the one
who teaches college physics.

11:18.095 --> 11:19.304
Injector's ready.

11:20.472 --> 11:22.391
It won't be as bad as the first time.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.309
Your body gets used to it fast.

11:37.739 --> 11:38.907
You okay?

12:04.725 --> 12:06.143
Where does it lead?

12:08.312 --> 12:12.900
If we just keep walking,
where do we end up?

12:14.776 --> 12:16.987
Well, the multiverse is infinite.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.282
I'm guessing there is no end.

12:27.873 --> 12:29.041
Jason!

12:38.091 --> 12:40.219
Amanda!

12:59.571 --> 13:00.656
Jason!

13:11.834 --> 13:12.835
Today's lesson's up.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.545
Thank you. We're not gonna need that.

13:15.671 --> 13:18.382
All right, everybody,
get out your notebooks.

13:42.406 --> 13:46.577
So, today we are gonna do a pop quiz.

13:46.577 --> 13:50.247
Tear out a piece of paper from your
notebooks, write your name at the top,

13:50.873 --> 13:53.166
and the numbers one through ten
down the margin.

13:54.293 --> 13:55.210
Yeah.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.629
No one really uses notebooks anymore.
I just have my laptop.

14:00.591 --> 14:02.342
What's on your screen right now?

14:04.344 --> 14:05.679
What's on his screen?

14:06.263 --> 14:07.264
YouTube.

14:07.931 --> 14:08.765
You fail.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.434
- Are you serious?
- Uh-huh.

14:10.434 --> 14:12.186
I only brought a laptop too.

14:12.186 --> 14:13.353
What are you watching?

14:14.146 --> 14:15.522
You fail.

14:16.523 --> 14:20.944
Everyone else who only has
a laptop or a device, you fail.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.746
You know what? Wait.

14:37.961 --> 14:38.962
Good luck.

14:42.674 --> 14:45.052
Wait! Where are you-- Dr. Dessen?

14:49.890 --> 14:50.974
Jason.

14:52.309 --> 14:57.189
Your TA just texted me you
broke a bottle in class and stormed out.

14:57.189 --> 14:59.816
I didn't storm out. I walked out.

15:00.484 --> 15:02.236
What the hell is going on?

15:02.236 --> 15:05.572
It's like a slow death in there so I quit.

15:06.949 --> 15:08.116
You can't do that.

15:08.116 --> 15:09.660
Yes, I can.

15:10.452 --> 15:13.121
Actually, I can do whatever I want.

15:47.030 --> 15:48.365
Same coordinates?

15:48.365 --> 15:49.491
Yeah.

15:51.076 --> 15:52.077
Yeah.

16:11.638 --> 16:12.639
Okay.

16:14.600 --> 16:18.812
So, now we know that
the connection between the doors

16:18.812 --> 16:23.025
and these worlds hold during
a given session of the drug.

16:39.249 --> 16:41.210
There was no atmosphere.

16:46.381 --> 16:49.009
This can't be real.
This can't be real.

16:49.009 --> 16:52.679
Amanda. Hey.

16:54.890 --> 16:56.016
Hey!

16:57.434 --> 16:59.811
Amanda! Hey!

17:01.522 --> 17:02.606
Stop!

17:10.155 --> 17:11.281
Amanda!

17:16.453 --> 17:17.454
Amanda!

17:19.122 --> 17:20.707
It has to have an end.

17:20.707 --> 17:23.460
I told you, there's no end!

17:24.127 --> 17:26.380
Why are we seeing these fucked-up worlds?

17:26.380 --> 17:29.341
Because it's a multiverse,

17:29.341 --> 17:32.803
and anything that can happen will happen.

17:32.803 --> 17:37.140
I mean, down that corridor somewhere,
there is a version of you and me

17:37.140 --> 17:39.810
that never made it in the box
when you helped me escape.

17:40.936 --> 17:43.397
Infinite possibilities.

17:43.939 --> 17:45.524
Infinite.

17:45.524 --> 17:47.609
Time is running out
on this dose of the drug.

17:47.609 --> 17:51.864
Yes. That's why we need to
start solving one problem at a time.

17:51.864 --> 17:55.367
We need food and water soon.

17:55.367 --> 17:57.452
So, let's just start opening doors,

17:58.203 --> 18:02.040
and just hope
that one of them looks like home.

18:33.614 --> 18:35.032
I think we made it.

18:43.165 --> 18:44.374
Hey, can you get us out?

18:44.958 --> 18:47.169
I don't know. I can try. This way.

18:49.254 --> 18:51.673
- Jason, stop.
- Wait, Leighton.

18:52.257 --> 18:53.842
She had nothing to do with it.

18:53.842 --> 18:54.968
Really?

18:54.968 --> 18:56.929
I made her. I forced her to.

18:56.929 --> 18:58.263
- He made you?
- Yeah.

18:58.263 --> 18:59.723
Because I've known you for a long time,

18:59.723 --> 19:02.142
and I've never known anyone
to make you do anything.

19:02.142 --> 19:04.228
I won't let you
keep hurting people, Leighton.

19:04.228 --> 19:05.354
Amanda.

19:05.354 --> 19:06.855
I'm fucking done.

19:08.690 --> 19:09.816
Leighton.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.193
We have to go.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.486
Well, in that case...

19:13.070 --> 19:14.279
No!

19:14.279 --> 19:15.280
Let's go.

19:23.247 --> 19:24.248
Amanda.

19:38.262 --> 19:41.139
Hey. It's okay.

19:42.641 --> 19:44.935
You're safe. It wasn't you.

19:44.935 --> 19:47.437
That was me until about three hours ago.

19:48.605 --> 19:52.234
Amanda, that was a different Amanda,
different Jason.

19:52.234 --> 19:54.736
Must've not escaped
till hours after we did.

19:58.824 --> 20:00.242
Gotta keep trying.

20:13.005 --> 20:14.715
There's no logic to it.

20:14.715 --> 20:16.300
Must be.

20:17.718 --> 20:19.344
We're just not seeing it.

20:21.555 --> 20:24.766
Your Jason had no theory
on how to control it?

20:24.766 --> 20:27.561
No. If he knew, he didn't tell me.

20:57.591 --> 20:58.467
Fuck this.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.136
Hey. Amanda.

21:08.310 --> 21:09.520
Amanda!

21:18.153 --> 21:19.363
Hey!

21:19.363 --> 21:20.447
Amanda!

21:22.574 --> 21:23.909
Where you going?

21:25.577 --> 21:26.662
Stop!

21:29.706 --> 21:30.624
Stop!

21:31.458 --> 21:33.961
I can't be in that
corridor for another second!

21:33.961 --> 21:35.254
We're gonna freeze!

21:35.254 --> 21:36.630
We gotta go back!

21:37.714 --> 21:39.049
I can't see anything.

21:45.806 --> 21:48.559
Come on. We need to find shelter. Come on!

21:52.980 --> 21:53.981
Come on.

22:19.548 --> 22:20.549
Hang on.

22:21.300 --> 22:22.301
Stay awake.

23:05.802 --> 23:07.262
We've gotta get you warm.

23:07.262 --> 23:08.347
All right.

23:13.227 --> 23:14.228
Okay.

23:15.938 --> 23:16.855
All right.

23:33.664 --> 23:34.957
Be right back.

23:50.639 --> 23:51.640
Hello?

23:56.812 --> 23:57.813
Anybody?

24:13.787 --> 24:14.872
Fuck.

24:57.206 --> 24:58.290
Jason!

24:59.791 --> 25:01.084
Fuck!

25:04.755 --> 25:05.756
Please.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.308
I don't know where to fucking...

25:53.470 --> 25:54.847
That you, Jay?

25:54.847 --> 25:56.181
How are you, man?

25:56.181 --> 25:58.809
Ignore the mess. I'm still a little
hungover from last night's festivities.

25:58.809 --> 26:01.395
- Hey. Look at you, huh?
- Hey.

26:02.020 --> 26:02.938
Yeah.

26:02.938 --> 26:04.815
You know,
I was surprised to get your text.

26:04.815 --> 26:07.484
Would you believe
I missed my old college pal?

26:08.402 --> 26:09.611
No.

26:10.904 --> 26:11.905
Splash?

26:11.905 --> 26:13.824
- Why not?
- Yeah.

26:16.076 --> 26:17.786
You ever get used to this?

26:18.912 --> 26:20.539
On most days, I don't even see it.

26:21.832 --> 26:22.916
Cheers, king.

26:23.625 --> 26:25.002
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

26:28.380 --> 26:31.008
Hey, I was really sorry
to hear about your grandfather.

26:33.969 --> 26:35.053
Thanks.

26:39.183 --> 26:41.268
So, how is the family business?

26:43.604 --> 26:45.981
Well, you're gonna
have to ask my dad that one.

26:45.981 --> 26:48.233
Velocity was always his thing.

26:48.233 --> 26:49.818
So, you two still on the outs, huh?

26:49.818 --> 26:53.113
Yeah. Haven't spoken to the bastard
in five years.

26:53.947 --> 26:57.201
Well, still,
you're doing pretty well for yourself.

26:58.243 --> 26:59.953
Well, my trust fund certainly has.

27:11.048 --> 27:12.841
- Yeah.
- Oh, Leighton...

27:16.011 --> 27:17.721
it's good to see you.

27:17.721 --> 27:19.056
Yeah?

27:20.307 --> 27:21.975
It's good to see you too, bud.

27:23.310 --> 27:27.147
So, fuck are you doing here?

27:30.234 --> 27:31.443
I quit teaching.

27:31.443 --> 27:33.779
I wanted to get back to what I started.

27:34.488 --> 27:35.489
Don't we all?

27:36.114 --> 27:37.783
So, what does that mean for you?

27:38.784 --> 27:41.578
More time with the family, for a start.

27:41.578 --> 27:43.121
Yeah. That's good.

27:43.705 --> 27:44.706
That's good.

27:45.874 --> 27:48.043
Good. You seen much of Ryan Holder lately?

27:48.627 --> 27:50.003
- A bit.
- Yeah?

27:50.671 --> 27:52.297
You know, he's having quite the year.

27:52.297 --> 27:54.466
Yeah, turned up here three months ago.

27:55.384 --> 27:57.511
Looking for some money
for his new venture.

28:01.098 --> 28:04.351
So, I'm just gonna be real with you, okay?

28:04.351 --> 28:06.728
I'm sure whatever
you're working on is amazing.

28:08.105 --> 28:10.065
You wanna hang out, catch up,
I'm your guy.

28:10.065 --> 28:12.150
But right now I'm just not
investing in anything anymore.

28:12.150 --> 28:14.611
Especially with friends.
No offense. Gets messy.

28:15.320 --> 28:16.363
All right?

28:17.781 --> 28:19.408
I mean, that's why you're here, right?

28:20.909 --> 28:22.744
Finally decided to start your own thing.

28:27.165 --> 28:30.794
Tell me, what you got going on today?

28:31.503 --> 28:34.089
Nothing.
I got no plans for the rest of my life.

28:35.382 --> 28:36.800
I wanna show you something.

29:38.278 --> 29:39.196
Fuck.

30:06.807 --> 30:08.308
Don't worry.

30:08.308 --> 30:10.644
This is not an elaborate plot to kill you...

30:11.645 --> 30:12.646
or is it?

30:13.647 --> 30:14.481
Funny.

30:14.481 --> 30:17.776
Yeah, I already told you.
Whatever this is, I'm not investing, so...

30:20.112 --> 30:22.531
Hello. What's this?

30:23.282 --> 30:26.785
It is a very special psychoactive drug.

30:27.411 --> 30:28.579
Let me see that.

30:29.872 --> 30:31.290
Psychoactive.

30:31.290 --> 30:32.833
Yeah. What's it do?

30:32.833 --> 30:34.585
One way to find out.

30:39.631 --> 30:41.008
All right, <i>salud</i>.

30:49.224 --> 30:51.101
All right. Let's go. Not a lot of time.

32:44.298 --> 32:45.924
Easy. Easy there.

32:49.845 --> 32:51.221
The hell is this?

32:51.763 --> 32:52.931
It's the drug.

32:52.931 --> 32:54.516
First time hits hard.

32:54.516 --> 32:55.684
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:56.560 --> 32:57.477
Hey.

33:00.189 --> 33:01.315
That it?

33:02.399 --> 33:03.942
Yeah, that's part of it.

33:05.152 --> 33:07.029
- Yeah.
- All right. Come on.

33:19.416 --> 33:21.168
What the fuck is that?

33:21.835 --> 33:23.253
It's my box.

33:25.172 --> 33:26.673
You built this here?

33:27.257 --> 33:29.843
It's a little more complicated than that.

33:29.843 --> 33:32.262
So, what does it do?

33:33.138 --> 33:36.308
It's easier if I just show you.

33:42.814 --> 33:44.399
You're fucking with me, right?

33:44.399 --> 33:45.609
No.

33:46.902 --> 33:48.070
Come in.

34:10.759 --> 34:11.592
Here.

34:11.592 --> 34:12.928
Thank you.

34:19.726 --> 34:21.061
Box is gone.

34:23.522 --> 34:24.982
Buried in the storm.

34:30.237 --> 34:34.199
I trained the box pilots to not freak out.
To stay in control.

34:36.326 --> 34:38.328
I've done neither of those things.

34:41.706 --> 34:42.708
Sorry.

34:53.342 --> 34:57.848
You know when I was little, every winter,
we'd go skiing in Argentina.

34:57.848 --> 34:59.766
My dad loved that.

35:00.934 --> 35:05.856
They had this crazy whiteouts.

35:08.692 --> 35:13.864
He'd be driving and the snow
would start blowing so hard,

35:16.575 --> 35:18.327
you'd have to pull over.

35:20.162 --> 35:22.247
Sit in the cold car.

35:25.167 --> 35:27.211
It was like the world was gone.

35:31.465 --> 35:34.885
Is there any chance that you had that
thought yesterday? In the corridor?

35:35.677 --> 35:37.054
What thought?

35:37.054 --> 35:38.972
Of being stranded in a whiteout.

35:41.308 --> 35:44.186
Yeah.

35:45.938 --> 35:51.109
I was feeling trapped and helpless,
like in those snowstorms.

35:51.109 --> 35:52.611
When exactly?

35:53.946 --> 35:57.449
Just before we walked
through the door into this world.

35:59.326 --> 36:00.327
Why?

36:02.496 --> 36:04.831
We know that the doors in the corridor

36:04.831 --> 36:08.710
are connections to infinite
parallel universes that seem random.

36:08.710 --> 36:11.171
Totally unconnected and uncontrollable.

36:13.131 --> 36:16.051
But what if our minds are
defining those connections?

36:16.051 --> 36:18.387
That they're not random at all?

36:18.387 --> 36:19.555
They're--

36:20.264 --> 36:24.017
That somehow we are choosing these worlds?

36:24.017 --> 36:25.477
I definitely didn't choose this world.

36:25.477 --> 36:26.895
No. Not intentionally, but...

36:27.771 --> 36:33.318
what if the worlds are a reflection
of our emotional state

36:33.318 --> 36:35.195
the moment we open the door?

36:38.574 --> 36:39.658
Jason...

36:41.285 --> 36:44.413
yesterday you were
talking about the multiverse.

36:44.413 --> 36:47.082
That everything that can happen
will happen.

36:47.666 --> 36:51.503
That somewhere there was a version of you
and me that never made it into the box.

36:51.503 --> 36:54.047
- Then you opened the door at Velocity--
- Then the door--

36:54.047 --> 36:56.675
We see that exact same scenario play out.

36:58.635 --> 37:01.930
The whole time I've been thinking,
"How do we control the box?"

37:01.930 --> 37:03.724
We are the controls.

37:03.724 --> 37:07.186
Maybe. And if that is the case,
then we can go anywhere we want.

37:09.521 --> 37:11.148
We could go home.

37:13.108 --> 37:17.112
Okay. An empty box?

37:17.946 --> 37:19.698
Your bright idea is storage space.

37:20.657 --> 37:22.367
Are you happy in your life?

37:25.370 --> 37:27.206
Yeah,
this is officially too weird for me--

37:27.206 --> 37:28.707
Stop. Stop and listen to me.

37:29.499 --> 37:31.126
I'm gonna show you something

37:31.877 --> 37:34.922
that not even the billionaires
of the world have access to.

37:35.839 --> 37:37.299
Yeah? What's that?

37:37.883 --> 37:39.426
The road not taken.

37:42.179 --> 37:46.767
Hey. Open the door or I'm
gonna beat your fucking ass.

37:54.191 --> 37:55.275
Yeah.

38:03.450 --> 38:05.035
Hey.

38:07.162 --> 38:08.497
Am I tripping?

38:08.497 --> 38:10.249
Not exactly, no.

38:12.084 --> 38:14.670
Leighton, I need you to listen to me.

38:14.670 --> 38:17.506
- Where do these doors go?
- Hey, Leighton. Hey, Leighton.

38:17.506 --> 38:19.132
- Hey. Wait, wait.
- Easy, easy.

38:19.132 --> 38:21.468
- Stop. Stop. Stop.
- Easy.

38:22.886 --> 38:26.098
Listen,
if you think the wrong thing in here,

38:26.807 --> 38:28.183
then we can both die.

38:29.810 --> 38:33.021
I don't wanna scare you,
but it's super important, okay?

38:33.021 --> 38:34.106
Okay.

38:34.106 --> 38:37.109
Now, I'm gonna open one of the doors,

38:37.109 --> 38:39.611
and I have some control
over what's on the other side.

38:39.611 --> 38:42.531
But what you think can affect it too.

38:43.198 --> 38:45.033
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- All right, listen.

38:45.033 --> 38:47.244
I'm confusing you, okay. Just--

38:48.120 --> 38:49.705
Do you practice meditation?

38:51.540 --> 38:54.293
Once. I was terrible at it.

38:54.877 --> 38:56.295
Couldn't stop thinking.

38:56.295 --> 38:57.462
Okay. That's okay.

38:58.672 --> 39:01.258
Clearing your mind for long periods
of time can take years of practice.

39:01.258 --> 39:04.678
The good news is, I just need you
to clear your mind for five seconds.

39:05.971 --> 39:08.807
Okay. So, how do I do that?

39:08.807 --> 39:13.729
Just focus on taking a long deep breath in

39:14.396 --> 39:16.481
and slowly letting it go.

39:20.777 --> 39:21.862
Now close your eyes.

39:23.363 --> 39:24.489
Keep breathing.

39:27.826 --> 39:31.955
In. Two. Three.

39:32.706 --> 39:35.918
Out. Two, three.
Just focus on your breath.

39:37.336 --> 39:38.337
In.

39:50.140 --> 39:51.767
The box should be over there.

39:55.771 --> 39:56.939
Are you ready?

40:02.110 --> 40:03.237
Thank you.

40:05.364 --> 40:07.783
All right. Let's go find it.

40:14.915 --> 40:16.416
Let me get a better reading.

40:21.171 --> 40:22.297
Fuck.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.633
The GPS is not working.

40:24.633 --> 40:26.218
Maybe it's frozen?

40:26.218 --> 40:28.220
We can't find it without this.

40:28.887 --> 40:31.139
We have to.
This world is gonna kill us.

40:35.060 --> 40:36.186
Come on.

40:44.736 --> 40:45.946
Turn around.

40:54.288 --> 40:55.289
What is it?

40:55.289 --> 40:59.334
In all these worlds, the box stands in
the same geographical location, right?

40:59.334 --> 41:01.670
No matter how much
the world around it changes,

41:01.670 --> 41:03.797
the GPS coordinates are always the same.

41:04.965 --> 41:06.258
Can you see the Sears Tower?

41:06.758 --> 41:08.385
That's south.

41:08.385 --> 41:10.137
Now look at the compass.

41:10.137 --> 41:12.514
It should be pointing that way.
It should be pointing north.

41:13.056 --> 41:16.602
Magnetic north,
but it's aiming in that direction.

41:18.061 --> 41:20.689
The box's magnetic field
is pushing the needle away.

41:22.357 --> 41:25.027
We're close.

41:48.967 --> 41:50.177
This way.

41:54.181 --> 41:56.225
- Can you see it?
- Yeah.

42:16.537 --> 42:17.454
Yeah!

42:19.623 --> 42:20.874
Goddamn!

42:28.674 --> 42:29.675
You ready?

42:31.301 --> 42:32.511
Where's Dad?

42:34.429 --> 42:35.472
I don't know.

42:36.139 --> 42:37.641
I've been calling and texting.

42:38.141 --> 42:39.142
Should we wait?

42:39.142 --> 42:41.895
No, it's fine.
It's getting dark. Let's go.

42:57.077 --> 43:01.164
Thank you for not letting me
freeze to death out there.

43:03.542 --> 43:04.918
So, then we're even?

43:05.586 --> 43:06.587
Hell, no.

43:07.671 --> 43:11.091
Let's not forget
this is still all your fault.

43:11.884 --> 43:14.303
Oh, yeah. Let's not forget that.

43:25.606 --> 43:26.857
I just realized...

43:29.026 --> 43:30.903
today is my son's birthday.

43:33.322 --> 43:34.323
How old?

43:36.241 --> 43:37.659
Sixteen.

43:39.494 --> 43:41.371
I'm sorry you're missing it.

44:03.769 --> 44:04.895
Tell me the story.

44:07.439 --> 44:08.440
Yeah.

44:11.026 --> 44:12.819
At our first ultrasound...

44:16.448 --> 44:18.367
we heard two heartbeats.

44:22.996 --> 44:26.458
We went from pure joy...

44:27.084 --> 44:29.378
...to sheer terror.

44:30.963 --> 44:33.423
And ultimately, pure joy.

44:36.260 --> 44:38.720
We weren't really ready to be parents.

44:38.720 --> 44:40.013
I mean, who is?

44:41.056 --> 44:43.725
It's just something
that you're thrown into.

44:44.518 --> 44:47.020
Like the ultimate deep end.

44:48.355 --> 44:53.861
At our next visit, the doctor
told us one heartbeat was normal.

44:54.528 --> 44:55.904
<i>Abnormalities.</i>

44:58.198 --> 44:59.533
Now, there's a word.

45:00.617 --> 45:01.869
<i>He was a fighter.</i>

45:05.706 --> 45:07.457
He was the first to be born.

45:11.545 --> 45:13.964
So brave.

45:15.632 --> 45:18.051
So full of light.

45:19.511 --> 45:23.098
It was the surgeries that
he couldn't take.

45:25.225 --> 45:27.227
He didn't make it through the third one.

45:30.731 --> 45:31.982
I'm so sorry.

45:34.985 --> 45:38.697
From the very beginning,
you were inseparable.

45:42.576 --> 45:43.785
When I think of him...

45:46.246 --> 45:47.789
he's always with you.

45:48.999 --> 45:53.045
<i>Those final months in hospitals,
Charlie just would not leave his side.</i>

45:56.006 --> 45:57.758
Is it still hard on him?

45:57.758 --> 46:00.511
Oh, yeah.
But he doesn't really talk about it.

46:02.346 --> 46:04.181
You know, we planted a tree

46:05.015 --> 46:09.061
and we mixed some of
his ashes in the soil.

46:12.397 --> 46:14.274
And every year on his birthday,

46:15.901 --> 46:20.113
we just sit there with him at dusk.

46:24.660 --> 46:26.328
But now I'm not there.

47:02.447 --> 47:03.615
He was alive.

47:05.367 --> 47:07.452
Living. Breathing.

47:07.953 --> 47:09.580
Yeah. I know.

47:12.749 --> 47:14.251
It's a lot to take in.

47:14.251 --> 47:16.587
It was the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

47:16.587 --> 47:19.006
Jason, the most beautiful thing
I've ever seen.

47:22.176 --> 47:23.177
It--

47:27.306 --> 47:29.099
You could've shown this to anyone.

47:29.099 --> 47:31.351
Walked away with whatever you wanted.
Why me?

47:31.351 --> 47:33.353
'Cause I can't trust anyone.

47:34.354 --> 47:35.439
And I know I can trust you.

47:35.439 --> 47:37.941
You don't even know me, bro!

47:38.942 --> 47:40.527
Not really!

47:42.404 --> 47:46.450
In the world where I come from,

47:47.326 --> 47:49.036
your parents died.

47:49.036 --> 47:50.746
Your grandfather raised you,

47:50.746 --> 47:54.499
and he handed you
Velocity Labs fresh out of college.

47:55.459 --> 48:00.380
And in that world, after I won
the Pavia Prize, you came to me

48:00.380 --> 48:03.884
and you asked me did I have
any ideas that you could invest in.

48:05.302 --> 48:06.303
And I did.

48:06.303 --> 48:08.889
And you and I,
we worked together for about ten years.

48:09.598 --> 48:12.309
We built the original version of this box.

48:13.435 --> 48:15.229
Right here in this exact spot.

48:16.104 --> 48:19.274
Only there it was a hangar.

48:19.274 --> 48:21.318
They tested jet engines.

48:23.403 --> 48:24.530
Yeah.

48:29.952 --> 48:31.495
So, you and I were close?

48:32.871 --> 48:33.872
Yeah.

48:35.165 --> 48:40.879
You--
Well, he was one of my closest friends.

48:43.048 --> 48:44.633
I trusted that Leighton.

48:44.633 --> 48:46.969
I knew exactly what he was capable of.

48:49.638 --> 48:51.181
That's why I trust you.

49:08.824 --> 49:10.367
So, you're not from this world?

49:16.707 --> 49:17.916
Why you here?

49:18.667 --> 49:23.172
I'm here to fix something
that I fucked up.

49:30.971 --> 49:36.518
So, the question is would you
leave this world if you could?

49:36.518 --> 49:39.146
Start over somewhere else?

49:43.108 --> 49:44.276
In a heartbeat.

49:44.818 --> 49:46.737
What would you give for that chance?

49:49.323 --> 49:50.407
What would I give?

49:50.407 --> 49:51.491
Yeah.

49:53.535 --> 49:54.661
Everything.

49:56.079 --> 49:57.080
Well...

49:59.958 --> 50:01.502
that's the ticket.

50:11.011 --> 50:11.887
Wow.

50:14.723 --> 50:15.724
What?

50:18.018 --> 50:21.980
That look that you just did.

50:21.980 --> 50:23.273
Right there.

50:24.358 --> 50:28.237
The squinty, staring off into space.

50:29.738 --> 50:31.448
You used to do it all the time.

50:32.115 --> 50:33.116
It's crazy.

50:33.742 --> 50:36.036
I remind you of him?

50:38.080 --> 50:39.122
Yeah.

50:40.874 --> 50:42.292
In so many ways.

50:44.002 --> 50:45.212
Was he happy?

50:48.423 --> 50:49.424
Come on.

50:50.759 --> 50:54.847
Come on. You can tell me.
I mean, we're pretty much the same person.

50:56.598 --> 50:57.599
Was he?

50:58.475 --> 50:59.476
No.

51:00.060 --> 51:01.812
I wouldn't say he was happy.

51:02.479 --> 51:04.273
All he did was work.

51:04.273 --> 51:07.943
He had this hard edge.

51:10.112 --> 51:13.156
The most driven human being
I've ever known.

51:18.620 --> 51:21.248
You know that he did this to me, right?

51:23.375 --> 51:24.751
What do you mean?

51:24.751 --> 51:27.171
Used the box to find my world.

51:28.088 --> 51:29.548
He abducted me.

51:31.842 --> 51:33.260
Brought me to his world.

51:36.221 --> 51:37.556
It was him.

51:37.556 --> 51:38.891
Why would he do that?

51:39.683 --> 51:42.686
I don't know.
You've lived with him. You tell me.

51:50.736 --> 51:51.737
Regret.

51:53.197 --> 51:54.990
If he wanted my life...

51:56.033 --> 51:57.868
could've just-- He could've killed me.

51:57.868 --> 51:58.827
No.

51:58.827 --> 52:02.247
Why would he go to all that trouble
just to bring me to his world?

52:02.247 --> 52:04.708
He's not a monster. He wouldn't do that.

52:06.168 --> 52:08.086
- If he did this to you...
- I know he did.

52:08.086 --> 52:09.796
...he would have rationalized it.

52:10.380 --> 52:13.717
In your world, you're a teacher, right?

52:14.426 --> 52:15.427
Yeah.

52:17.387 --> 52:18.764
Are you wealthy?

52:22.142 --> 52:24.269
No.

52:24.978 --> 52:27.439
My Jason probably told himself

52:28.524 --> 52:31.818
he was giving you a chance of a lifetime.

52:35.072 --> 52:37.699
A shot at the path not taken.

52:39.034 --> 52:40.786
For you and him.

52:41.411 --> 52:43.205
But why my life?

52:43.914 --> 52:47.626
Of all the billions of Jasons, why me?

52:48.585 --> 52:51.213
What's the one thing
you had that he didn't?

52:55.676 --> 52:57.261
Daniela and Charlie.

52:58.720 --> 52:59.763
No.

53:08.397 --> 53:10.732
- Don't give me shit.
- You're doing it wrong.

53:10.732 --> 53:12.734
- They're gonna be great.
- Let me see.

53:13.443 --> 53:16.321
- Fake it till you make it?
- Okay. Something like that.

53:25.539 --> 53:31.170
Do you think,
Dad's been going through some stuff?

53:37.843 --> 53:39.178
What do you mean?

53:39.178 --> 53:42.389
Well, I don't know.
He just seems off recently.

53:43.182 --> 53:44.183
You know?

53:45.601 --> 53:46.685
Hey, fam.

53:50.355 --> 53:51.481
Smells amazing.

53:51.481 --> 53:53.609
Yeah. We're making
spaghetti and meatballs.

53:54.776 --> 53:56.904
You know, Max's favorite.

54:00.199 --> 54:01.992
You missed our time at his tree.

54:05.704 --> 54:08.665
Yeah, I know. I'm-- Look, I'm so sorry.

54:10.167 --> 54:15.589
But I was embroiled
in a top-secret errand.

54:17.925 --> 54:20.886
A birthday-boy-related errand actually.

54:22.763 --> 54:25.140
Well, maybe we could
go back out to the tree.

54:26.016 --> 54:27.059
If you want?

54:27.059 --> 54:30.062
Yeah. Of course. Yeah. In a minute.

54:30.062 --> 54:31.897
What's this back here?

54:38.362 --> 54:39.404
Thank you.

54:43.033 --> 54:44.117
For you.

54:45.077 --> 54:46.078
And for us.

54:46.828 --> 54:48.997
Because today...

54:51.166 --> 54:55.212
is a very big day for this family.

55:02.010 --> 55:03.846
You're not gonna open the box?

55:12.855 --> 55:13.856
What?

55:16.149 --> 55:17.734
Happy birthday, pal.

55:18.819 --> 55:20.529
From your Mom and me.

55:23.407 --> 55:24.616
Are you serious?

55:25.993 --> 55:27.202
It's parked outside.

55:40.507 --> 55:42.217
Holy shit!

55:55.522 --> 55:57.149
Jason, what the fuck?

55:58.317 --> 56:00.068
Listen, I quit my job today.

56:00.736 --> 56:01.737
What?

56:01.737 --> 56:04.948
I was standing up there,
looking out at the class,

56:04.948 --> 56:07.659
and this one thought kept repeating
in my head, it was just...

56:09.286 --> 56:11.121
that I was meant for more than this.

56:11.705 --> 56:12.873
Without talking to me?

56:13.999 --> 56:15.459
Yeah. I know. I'm sorry.

56:16.210 --> 56:17.753
- But I just couldn't do it anymore.
- Okay.

56:17.753 --> 56:22.049
But my job isn't enough to float us,
let alone buy a car.

56:22.049 --> 56:25.260
I think you should quit your job
and get back to painting.

56:26.178 --> 56:27.679
Oh, yeah? How am I gonna do that?

56:28.514 --> 56:31.683
Before Charlie was born,
I was working on a thing.

56:31.683 --> 56:33.227
Remember the little box.

56:33.227 --> 56:34.311
Yeah?

56:34.311 --> 56:35.646
It was very important to me,

56:35.646 --> 56:39.441
but I quit because I wanted to be
fully present for you both.

56:40.192 --> 56:41.860
I got an investor.

56:42.903 --> 56:43.904
Hey!

56:43.904 --> 56:45.155
Thank you, Dad.

56:47.074 --> 56:48.283
Thank you.

56:48.283 --> 56:50.035
Can we go for a ride?

56:50.035 --> 56:52.204
- Yeah. Come on.
- Yeah?

56:52.204 --> 56:53.288
Sure.

56:53.872 --> 56:56.166
You don't have to
worry about money anymore.

56:58.961 --> 57:00.379
You wanna ride shotgun?

57:00.379 --> 57:01.713
Mom, you coming?

57:02.297 --> 57:03.507
Coming.
