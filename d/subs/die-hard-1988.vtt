00:55.500 --> 00:59.129
You don't like flying, do you?

00:59.237 --> 01:01.603
What gives you that idea?

01:03.708 --> 01:04.640
You want to know the secret...

01:04.742 --> 01:08.371
to surviving air travel?

01:08.479 --> 01:09.571
After you get
where you're going,

01:09.681 --> 01:11.206
take off your shoes and socks.

01:11.317 --> 01:13.080
Then walk around,

01:13.185 --> 01:15.847
making fists
with your toes.

01:15.954 --> 01:17.854
Fists with your toes?

01:19.391 --> 01:20.858
It sounds crazy,

01:20.959 --> 01:23.894
but I've been doing it
for nine years.

01:23.996 --> 01:26.931
Better than a shower
and a cup of coffee.

01:28.534 --> 01:29.558
Okay.

01:39.478 --> 01:41.208
It's okay.
I'm a cop.

01:42.882 --> 01:44.440
Trust me.

01:44.551 --> 01:47.587
I've been doing this
for 11 years.

01:47.687 --> 01:50.155
<i>On behalf of
the captain and crew,</i>

01:50.256 --> 01:53.123
<i>we'd like to welcome you
to Los Angeles.</i>

01:53.226 --> 01:55.126
<i>Have a very Merry Christmas.</i>

02:10.043 --> 02:13.912
<i>Flight 227 to Tucson
now boarding at gate 14.</i>

02:27.027 --> 02:28.085
Ah.

02:29.697 --> 02:31.597
How do you do?

02:42.544 --> 02:43.943
Ladies and gentlemen.

02:44.045 --> 02:45.945
Ladies and gentlemen!

02:46.047 --> 02:49.949
I want to congratulate
each and every one of you...

02:50.051 --> 02:52.952
for making this
one of the greatest years...

02:53.054 --> 02:55.955
in the history
of the Nakatomi Corporation.

02:57.559 --> 03:00.392
On behalf of
the chief executive officer,

03:00.495 --> 03:03.396
Mr. Ozu,
and the board of directors,

03:03.498 --> 03:05.898
we wish you
a Merry Christmas...

03:06.001 --> 03:08.060
and a Happy New Year!

03:08.171 --> 03:09.570
Merry Christmas!

03:09.672 --> 03:11.401
Happy New Year!

03:11.507 --> 03:12.906
Hey, Holly,

03:13.009 --> 03:14.408
what about
dinner tonight, huh?

03:14.510 --> 03:17.411
Harry, it's Christmas Eve.

03:17.513 --> 03:20.414
Families, stockings...

03:22.351 --> 03:23.909
chestnuts...

03:24.020 --> 03:25.419
Rudolph and Frosty.

03:25.521 --> 03:28.422
Any of these things
ring a bell?

03:28.524 --> 03:30.424
Actually, I was
thinking more...

03:30.526 --> 03:33.427
of mulled wine,
a nice aged brie,

03:33.529 --> 03:35.429
and a roaring fireplace.

03:35.531 --> 03:37.431
You know what I'm saying?

03:40.036 --> 03:41.436
Ginny, it's 5:40.

03:41.538 --> 03:44.439
Go join the party.
Have some champagne.

03:44.541 --> 03:47.442
You're making me feel
like Ebenezer Scrooge.

03:47.544 --> 03:50.445
Can the baby
handle a little sip?

03:50.547 --> 03:52.947
That baby's ready
to tend bar.

03:53.050 --> 03:55.075
Last chance.

03:55.185 --> 03:56.277
Bye.

04:02.493 --> 04:05.951
McClane residence.
Lucy McClane speaking.

04:06.064 --> 04:07.554
Hello, Lucy McClane.

04:07.665 --> 04:09.565
This is
your mother speaking.

04:09.667 --> 04:11.066
Mommy!

04:11.169 --> 04:13.069
When are you
coming home?

04:13.171 --> 04:15.071
Pretty soon.
Pretty soon.

04:15.173 --> 04:18.574
You'll be in bed
when I get there, though.

04:18.676 --> 04:20.576
Let me talk to Paulina.

04:20.678 --> 04:23.078
And no snooping
around the house,

04:23.181 --> 04:24.614
looking for presents.

04:24.716 --> 04:27.082
Is Daddy coming home
with you?

04:29.354 --> 04:31.254
Well, we'll see what...

04:31.356 --> 04:33.756
Santa and Mommy
can do, okay?

04:33.858 --> 04:35.758
Put Paulina on.
Bye, honey.

04:35.860 --> 04:37.452
Paulina!

04:42.535 --> 04:44.560
<i>Hola, Mrs. Holly.</i>

04:44.670 --> 04:47.434
Um, did Mr. McClane call?

04:47.540 --> 04:50.441
<i>No, Mrs. Holly.
No telefono.</i>

04:50.543 --> 04:52.943
Well, he probably just
didn't have time...

04:53.045 --> 04:54.444
before his flight.

04:54.547 --> 04:57.277
Um, make up
the spare bedroom...

04:57.383 --> 04:58.782
just in case.

04:58.884 --> 05:01.444
<i>Si, Mrs. Holly.
I do that already.</i>

05:01.554 --> 05:04.387
What would I do
without you, Paulina?

05:24.511 --> 05:25.910
Oh!

05:29.516 --> 05:31.211
California.

05:43.531 --> 05:45.431
Hey, I'm John McClane.

05:45.533 --> 05:47.091
Argyle.

05:47.201 --> 05:48.998
I'm your limo driver.

05:51.339 --> 05:53.364
Nice bear.

05:57.545 --> 05:59.445
Okay... Argyle.

05:59.547 --> 06:02.015
What do we do now?

06:02.116 --> 06:03.879
You tell me.

06:03.985 --> 06:06.920
It's my first time
driving a limo.

06:07.022 --> 06:10.014
This is my first time
riding in one.

06:10.158 --> 06:13.059
Relax. We got everything
in this mug, man.

06:13.161 --> 06:16.392
Look at this-
CD, CB, TV,

06:16.498 --> 06:19.058
telephone, full bar, VHS.

06:20.602 --> 06:22.900
If your friend's
hot to trot,

06:23.005 --> 06:25.405
I know a few
mama bears.

06:25.507 --> 06:27.407
Or is he married?

06:27.509 --> 06:28.908
He's married.

06:29.011 --> 06:30.410
Okay.

06:30.512 --> 06:32.412
Oh, sorry about that.

06:32.514 --> 06:34.414
It's the girl's day off.

06:34.516 --> 06:37.918
I didn't know
you were gonna sit up front.

06:38.021 --> 06:40.921
So, uh, your lady
live out here?

06:41.025 --> 06:42.924
About the past
six months.

06:43.026 --> 06:45.927
Meaning you still
live in New York?

06:46.029 --> 06:48.623
You always ask
this many questions, Argyle?

06:48.731 --> 06:50.358
Sorry, man.
I used to drive a cab.

06:50.466 --> 06:52.229
People would expect
a little chitchat.

06:52.335 --> 06:53.666
So you divorced?

06:53.770 --> 06:55.670
Just drive the car, man.

06:55.772 --> 06:58.172
Come on.
You divorced?

06:58.274 --> 07:00.606
You separated?
She beat you up?

07:02.378 --> 07:04.778
She had a good job.

07:04.881 --> 07:06.781
It turned into
a great career.

07:06.884 --> 07:09.785
<i>That meant
she had to move here.</i>

07:09.887 --> 07:12.287
You're very fast, Argyle.

07:12.389 --> 07:15.324
<i>So why didn't you come?</i>

07:17.394 --> 07:18.554
<i>Well?</i>

07:18.662 --> 07:20.186
What's up?

07:20.297 --> 07:22.629
Because I'm
a New York cop.

07:22.733 --> 07:26.134
I got a six-month backlog
of New York scumbags.

07:26.236 --> 07:29.364
I can't just pick up
and go that easy.

07:29.473 --> 07:32.465
You thought
she wouldn't make it out here,

07:32.576 --> 07:34.976
so why bother
to pack, right?

07:35.079 --> 07:37.981
Like I said,
you're very fast, Argyle.

07:38.082 --> 07:41.109
You mind if we
hear some tunes?

07:44.355 --> 07:47.722
Hey, that will work.

07:47.826 --> 07:51.091
Don't you got
any Christmas music?

07:51.196 --> 07:53.324
<i>This is Christmas music.</i>

07:55.100 --> 07:57.330
<i># It was December 24th
on Hollis Ave. after dark #</i>

07:57.435 --> 07:59.926
<i># When I seen a man chillin'
with his dog in the park #</i>

08:00.038 --> 08:01.869
<i># I approached them
very slowly #</i>

08:01.973 --> 08:03.736
<i># With my heart full of fear
looked at his dog #</i>

08:03.842 --> 08:05.503
<i># Oh, my God,
a ill reindeer#</i>

08:05.610 --> 08:07.601
<i># But then I was illin'
'cause the man had a beard #</i>

08:07.712 --> 08:10.181
<i># And a bag full of goodies
12:00 hit, man #</i>

08:10.282 --> 08:11.579
<i># So I turned my head a second #</i>

08:11.684 --> 08:13.083
<i># And the man was gone #</i>

08:13.185 --> 08:14.243
<i># But he must have
dropped his wallet #</i>

08:14.353 --> 08:15.911
<i># Smack dead on the lawn #</i>

08:16.021 --> 08:17.921
<i># I picked the wallet up,
and then I took a pause #</i>

08:18.023 --> 08:20.287
<i># Took out the
license and it cold said "Santa Claus"#</i>

08:20.392 --> 08:22.952
<i># A million dollars in it
cold hundreds of G's ##</i>

08:23.062 --> 08:26.463
So your lady sees you,
the music comes up,

08:26.565 --> 08:29.466
and you live happily
ever after, right?

08:29.568 --> 08:31.468
I can live with that.

08:31.570 --> 08:35.974
If it doesn't work out,
you got a place to stay?

08:36.075 --> 08:37.976
I'll find a place.

08:38.077 --> 08:39.409
Tell you what.

08:39.513 --> 08:41.811
I'll wait
in the parking garage.

08:41.914 --> 08:44.406
You score, you call
on the car phone.

08:44.518 --> 08:47.646
You strike out,
I'll get you a hotel.

08:47.754 --> 08:49.779
You're all right, Argyle.

08:49.890 --> 08:53.951
Just remember that
when you sign for the tip.

09:16.884 --> 09:18.112
Hi.

09:18.219 --> 09:19.618
Good evening.

09:19.720 --> 09:22.120
I'm here to see
Holly McClane.

09:22.223 --> 09:24.123
Just type it in there.

09:29.230 --> 09:31.425
Cute toy.

09:31.532 --> 09:34.831
If you have to
take a leak,

09:34.936 --> 09:36.802
it finds
your zipper.

09:51.153 --> 09:52.313
Christ.

09:57.426 --> 09:59.326
30th floor.

09:59.428 --> 10:00.793
The party.

10:00.896 --> 10:03.660
They're the only ones
left in the building.

10:03.765 --> 10:05.164
Take the express elevator...

10:05.267 --> 10:07.168
until you hear the noise.

10:07.269 --> 10:08.669
Thanks.

11:05.429 --> 11:06.828
Champagne, sir?

11:06.932 --> 11:08.331
Yeah, thanks.

11:42.801 --> 11:45.497
Oh, I'm sorry.

11:45.603 --> 11:48.334
Hey, Merry Christmas!

11:51.610 --> 11:53.510
Jesus.

11:53.612 --> 11:56.012
Fuckin' California.

11:57.283 --> 12:00.442
Why don't
I talk to him right now?

12:00.553 --> 12:01.611
Hi.

12:01.721 --> 12:02.949
I'm looking for-

12:03.055 --> 12:04.283
Holly Gennero.

12:04.390 --> 12:05.482
Yeah.

12:05.591 --> 12:07.457
You must be
John McClane.

12:07.561 --> 12:08.960
Joe Takagi.

12:09.062 --> 12:10.962
How was your ride in?

12:11.064 --> 12:12.964
I have you to thank?

12:13.066 --> 12:15.466
Seemed the least
we could do.

12:15.569 --> 12:17.969
Quite a place
you have here.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.470
It will be.

12:19.573 --> 12:20.972
Several floors are
under construction.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.474
Holly went to fax
some documents.

12:23.577 --> 12:24.976
In the meanwhile,

12:25.078 --> 12:26.978
her office is
right back here.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.213
<i>Ellis.</i>

12:31.318 --> 12:35.085
I was just making a call.

12:35.188 --> 12:38.852
I want you to meet
John McClane,

12:38.960 --> 12:40.325
Holly's husband-

12:40.428 --> 12:41.656
Holly's policeman.

12:41.763 --> 12:44.493
Ellis is in charge of
international development.

12:44.599 --> 12:47.500
Heard a heck of a lot
about you.

12:47.602 --> 12:49.536
Missed some.

12:50.938 --> 12:52.838
Can I get you anything?

12:52.940 --> 12:54.339
Food? Cake?

12:54.442 --> 12:56.342
Some watered-down
champagne?

12:56.444 --> 12:58.503
No, thank you.
I'm fine.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.946
You throw quite a party.

13:01.048 --> 13:02.447
I didn't realize...

13:02.549 --> 13:04.780
they celebrated
Christmas in Japan.

13:04.886 --> 13:06.787
Pearl Harbor
didn't work out,

13:06.889 --> 13:10.950
so we got you
with tape decks.

13:11.060 --> 13:14.291
Actually, it's sort of
a double celebration.

13:14.396 --> 13:18.093
Holly helped us close
a big deal today.

13:18.200 --> 13:21.465
<i>I'll be out in
a couple of minutes.</i>

13:25.007 --> 13:26.975
John.

13:29.978 --> 13:32.469
Have you met everyone?

13:32.581 --> 13:34.981
We've been
sticking him with spears.

13:35.085 --> 13:36.985
Of course, he has.

13:37.087 --> 13:39.487
She was made
for the business.

13:39.589 --> 13:40.988
Tough as nails.

13:41.091 --> 13:42.490
I was hoping...

13:42.592 --> 13:43.991
you made that flight.

13:44.094 --> 13:45.994
Show him the watch.

13:46.096 --> 13:47.154
Later.

13:47.263 --> 13:48.662
Go on.
Show him.

13:48.765 --> 13:50.130
What, are you
embarrassed?

13:50.233 --> 13:53.293
<i>A token of appreciation
for her hard work.</i>

13:53.403 --> 13:54.995
It's a Rolex.

13:55.105 --> 13:57.505
I'm sure
I'll see it later.

13:57.607 --> 14:00.735
Is there a place
where I could wash up?

14:00.844 --> 14:03.278
Sure.

14:18.628 --> 14:19.993
Ellis gets very depressed...

14:20.096 --> 14:21.655
this time of year.

14:21.765 --> 14:24.632
He thought he was
God's greatest gift.

14:24.735 --> 14:26.635
Yeah.
I know the type.

14:26.737 --> 14:30.138
Think he's got
his eye on you.

14:30.241 --> 14:31.640
That's okay...

14:31.742 --> 14:33.141
I have my eye...

14:33.244 --> 14:34.644
on his private bathroom.

14:34.745 --> 14:36.144
Where you staying?

14:36.247 --> 14:38.148
Things happened so fast,

14:38.250 --> 14:41.151
I didn't get
a chance to ask you.

14:41.253 --> 14:43.983
Cappy Roberts
retired out here.

14:44.089 --> 14:46.819
He told me
I could bunk with him.

14:46.925 --> 14:49.655
Cappy retired, huh?
Where's he live?

14:49.761 --> 14:50.921
Ramona.

14:51.029 --> 14:53.122
Pomona.

14:53.231 --> 14:54.323
Huh?

14:54.432 --> 14:55.490
<i>Pomona.</i>

14:55.600 --> 14:56.794
Pomona.

14:56.902 --> 14:58.836
Yeah.

14:58.937 --> 15:01.770
You'll be in the car
half the time.

15:01.873 --> 15:03.272
Why don't we make it easy?

15:03.375 --> 15:05.936
I have a spare bedroom.

15:06.044 --> 15:08.741
It's not huge
or anything, but...

15:08.848 --> 15:12.249
the kids would love
to have you at the house.

15:12.351 --> 15:14.444
They would, huh?

15:17.557 --> 15:19.286
I would, too.

15:22.061 --> 15:23.119
Ooh!

15:23.229 --> 15:25.163
Sorry.

15:31.571 --> 15:33.471
I missed you.

15:41.048 --> 15:43.278
I guess you didn't
miss my name, though, huh?

15:43.383 --> 15:47.319
Except maybe when
you're signing checks?

15:47.421 --> 15:49.446
Since when are you
" Ms. Gennero"?

15:52.092 --> 15:53.992
This is
a Japanese company.

15:54.094 --> 15:58.190
- They figure a married woman's
got- - You are a married woman.

15:58.298 --> 16:01.131
- You're married to me.
- Are we going to have this conversation again?

16:01.235 --> 16:03.431
<i>- We never finished this conversation
in July. - I had an opportunity-</i>

16:03.538 --> 16:05.836
- I had to take it.
- Right, no matter what the consequences.

16:05.939 --> 16:08.738
- No matter what it did to our marriage.
- It didn't do anything...

16:08.843 --> 16:11.004
except change your idea
of what our marriage should be.

16:11.112 --> 16:14.104
- You don't have a clue what my idea of our marriage should be.
- I know exactly...

16:14.215 --> 16:16.581
what your idea
of our marriage should be.

16:16.684 --> 16:18.447
Ms. Gennero, I-

16:20.221 --> 16:21.882
Excuse me.

16:21.990 --> 16:23.753
Hi.

16:23.858 --> 16:27.191
Um, Mr. Takagi
is looking for you.

16:27.295 --> 16:30.628
<i>He wants you
to say something to the troops.</i>

16:34.569 --> 16:36.162
Speech time.

16:36.272 --> 16:38.672
Be back in
a few minutes.

16:50.585 --> 16:52.485
That was great,John.

16:52.588 --> 16:53.987
Good job.

16:54.089 --> 16:55.647
Very mature.

17:45.409 --> 17:47.309
So Kareem rebounds, right?

17:47.411 --> 17:49.311
Feeds Worthy on the break,

17:49.413 --> 17:51.745
over to A.C., to Magic,
then back to Worthy, right?

17:53.184 --> 17:54.310
Boom!

17:54.418 --> 17:55.578
Two points!

17:59.090 --> 18:00.387
We're in.

Fists with your toes.

21:45.123 --> 21:46.021
Yeah, Argyle?

21:46.124 --> 21:48.024
How's it going up there?

21:48.126 --> 21:50.356
All right.
Where are you?

21:50.462 --> 21:53.397
What's the word with
you and your lady?

21:53.498 --> 21:55.659
Uh, the vote's
not in yet.

22:06.379 --> 22:09.143
<i>Nein! Nein! Nein!</i>

22:27.233 --> 22:28.666
Argyle?

22:28.768 --> 22:30.133
Mac, you there?

22:30.236 --> 22:31.294
Hello?

22:38.345 --> 22:39.642
<i># Somebody... ##</i>

22:39.747 --> 22:42.079
You know the number.
Use it.

24:14.244 --> 24:16.371
Stay calm.
Everything's going to be fine.

24:16.480 --> 24:19.005
Everything's going to be fine.

24:38.069 --> 24:39.297
Shit!

24:42.907 --> 24:45.808
Think. Think.

25:01.860 --> 25:05.421
Ladies and gentlemen.

25:05.531 --> 25:07.761
Ladies and gentlemen.

25:15.274 --> 25:17.139
Due to the
Nakatomi Corporation's...

25:17.242 --> 25:19.642
legacy of greed
around the globe,

25:19.745 --> 25:22.646
they're about to be
taught a lesson...

25:22.748 --> 25:25.148
in the real use of power.

25:25.250 --> 25:27.150
You will be witnesses.

25:28.921 --> 25:30.320
Now-

25:30.422 --> 25:33.221
Where is Mr. Takagi?

25:35.962 --> 25:39.591
Joseph Yoshinobu Takagi,

25:41.267 --> 25:44.634
<i>- Born Kyoto, 1937.
- Don't move.</i>

25:44.737 --> 25:49.834
Family emigrated to
San Pedro, California, 1939.

25:49.943 --> 25:54.812
Interned at Manzanar,
1942 to 1943.

25:54.914 --> 25:59.817
<i>Scholarship student,
University of California,</i>

26:10.931 --> 26:14.799
MBA, Harvard, 1970.

26:14.902 --> 26:17.803
President,
Nakatomi Trading.

26:17.905 --> 26:20.806
Vice chairman,
Nakatomi Investment Group.

26:20.908 --> 26:22.705
Enough.

26:22.810 --> 26:26.803
And father of five.

26:26.914 --> 26:28.814
I am Takagi.

26:28.916 --> 26:32.751
How do you do?

26:32.854 --> 26:35.322
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

26:46.935 --> 26:50.496
Okay, 32, construction,
33, computers.

26:54.109 --> 26:56.703

26:56.811 --> 27:02.773
# Do do do do

27:02.885 --> 27:05.410
Nice suit.

27:05.521 --> 27:08.752

London.</i>

27:10.393 --> 27:13.021
I have two myself.

27:13.129 --> 27:15.962
Rumor has it
Arafat buys his there.

27:21.904 --> 27:24.498
On the left.

27:45.595 --> 27:50.157
"And when Alexander saw
the breadth of his domain,

27:50.267 --> 27:54.829
he wept, for there were
no more worlds to conquer. "

27:57.941 --> 28:00.775
Benefits of
a classical education.

28:00.878 --> 28:02.402
Oh,

28:02.513 --> 28:05.277
that's beautiful.

28:05.383 --> 28:07.783
I always enjoyed
to make models...

28:07.885 --> 28:09.785
when I was a boy.

28:09.887 --> 28:11.286
The exactness,

28:11.389 --> 28:13.789
the attention to every
conceivable detail.

28:13.891 --> 28:17.327
It's beautiful.

28:17.428 --> 28:20.226
Is this what this is all about?
Our project in Indonesia?

28:20.331 --> 28:23.300
<i>Contrary to what
you people may think,</i>

28:23.401 --> 28:25.801
<i>we're going to
develop that region,</i>

28:25.903 --> 28:27.302
<i>not exploit it.</i>

28:27.405 --> 28:29.066
I believe you.

28:29.173 --> 28:32.302
<i>I read the article
in Forbes.</i>

28:34.179 --> 28:36.613
Mr. Takagi,

28:37.616 --> 28:41.052
I could talk about industrialization
and men's fashions all day,

28:41.153 --> 28:43.178
but I'm afraid
work must intrude,

28:43.288 --> 28:45.813
and my associate here
has some questions for you.

28:45.924 --> 28:50.418
Sort of fill-in-the-blanks
questions, actually.

28:59.939 --> 29:01.600
I don't have that code!

29:01.708 --> 29:04.438
You broke in here
to access our computer?

29:06.146 --> 29:09.638
Any information you could get, when
they wake up in Tokyo, they'll change it.

29:09.749 --> 29:12.616
<i>You won't be able to blackmail
our executives, threaten our pro-</i>

29:12.719 --> 29:14.778
Sit... down!

29:24.064 --> 29:27.329
Mr. Takagi,
I'm really not interested...

29:27.434 --> 29:28.958
in your computer.

29:33.074 --> 29:35.474
But I need the code key...

29:35.576 --> 29:39.478
<i>because I am interested
in the $640 million...</i>

29:39.580 --> 29:41.480
in negotiable bearer bonds...

29:41.582 --> 29:44.483
that you have
locked in your vault.

29:44.585 --> 29:48.749
And the computer
controls the vault.

29:48.856 --> 29:50.983
You want money?

29:51.092 --> 29:54.755
What kind
of terrorists are you?

29:57.098 --> 30:00.500
Who said
we were terrorists?

30:19.554 --> 30:23.957
<i>The bonds represent
at most ten days'...</i>

30:24.059 --> 30:26.527
<i>operating capital
for your parent organization.</i>

30:35.238 --> 30:37.365
The code, please.

30:38.007 --> 30:39.235
It's useless to you.

30:39.342 --> 30:43.301
There are seven vault safeguards,
and the code key's only one of them.

30:43.412 --> 30:45.243
You'll never get it open.

30:45.348 --> 30:48.249
Then there's no reason
not to tell us.

30:48.351 --> 30:49.545
I told you.

30:49.652 --> 30:51.745
It's not over yet.

30:56.359 --> 30:58.259
It's a very nice suit...

30:58.361 --> 31:00.353
Mr. Takagi.

31:00.464 --> 31:03.194
It would be a shame
to ruin it.

31:06.303 --> 31:08.931
I'm going to
count to three.

31:09.039 --> 31:12.008
<i>There will not be a four.</i>

31:12.109 --> 31:13.736
Give me...

31:13.844 --> 31:16.711
the code.

31:16.813 --> 31:18.212
One...

31:20.317 --> 31:22.251
<i>Two...</i>

31:24.321 --> 31:26.346
- Three.
- I don't know it. I'm telling you!

31:26.456 --> 31:28.048
Get on the jet to Tokyo
and ask the chairman.

31:28.158 --> 31:30.992
I'm telling you.
You're just gonna have to kill me.

31:31.095 --> 31:32.289
Okay.

31:35.466 --> 31:37.832
We'll do it
the hard way.

31:37.936 --> 31:39.927
Tony, see if you
can dispose of that.

31:40.038 --> 31:43.303
Karl, better check
on Heinrich's work.

32:08.167 --> 32:09.657
Nothing.

32:09.768 --> 32:11.633
See to Heinrich.

32:13.239 --> 32:14.638
Now...

32:14.740 --> 32:17.641
you can
break the code?

32:17.743 --> 32:19.643
You didn't
bring me along...

32:19.745 --> 32:21.645
for my charming
personality.

32:28.255 --> 32:31.156
Argyle, tell me
you heard the shots.

32:31.258 --> 32:32.987
You're callin'
the police right now.

32:34.594 --> 32:36.152
Of course
I'm coming by later.

32:36.263 --> 32:38.663
Have I ever lied to you?

32:38.765 --> 32:42.098
My boss?
Thinks I'm on my way to Vegas.

32:42.202 --> 32:45.660
Uli, get up on the pipes.

32:45.772 --> 32:48.673
Marco, you go
through here.

32:48.775 --> 32:51.676
I'll throw you the cord.

32:55.782 --> 32:57.978
Hans, we're on the roof.

33:11.032 --> 33:12.624
Here.

33:24.812 --> 33:27.144
Thirty minutes
to break the code,

33:27.248 --> 33:30.150
Two hours, two and a half hours
for the five mechanicals...

33:30.252 --> 33:31.651
at the minimum.

33:31.753 --> 33:35.154
The seventh lock,
however, is out of my hands.

33:57.714 --> 33:59.181
I'm sorry-

33:59.282 --> 34:01.614
The seventh lock-
the electromagnetic seal.

34:01.718 --> 34:03.083
You do understand...

34:03.186 --> 34:05.017
the circuits cannot
be cut locally.

34:06.723 --> 34:08.815
Trust me.

34:08.991 --> 34:12.188
Why the fuck
didn't you stop him,John?

34:13.795 --> 34:16.697
'Cause then
you'd be dead, too, asshole!

34:16.799 --> 34:18.699
Think, goddamn it!
Think!

34:31.315 --> 34:33.112
We've got a fire alarm.

34:33.217 --> 34:34.706
Call 911.

34:34.818 --> 34:38.719
Give them the guard's name
and the building code number,

34:38.822 --> 34:40.880
and cancel the alarm.

34:40.991 --> 34:42.719
Then disable the system.

34:44.328 --> 34:47.126
On what floor
did the alarm go off?

34:48.831 --> 34:51.232
Now, shall we go?

34:51.335 --> 34:52.734
<i>Nein.</i>

35:04.282 --> 35:06.182
Oh, baby, come to Papa.

35:06.284 --> 35:07.683
Come on.

35:13.491 --> 35:16.085
Come on, baby.
Come to Papa.

35:16.194 --> 35:18.185
<i>I'll kiss
your fuckin'dalmatian.</i>

35:21.299 --> 35:23.096
You stupid motherfuckers!
No!

35:23.201 --> 35:26.568
Turn the fuckin' truck around!

35:59.339 --> 36:03.173
The fire has been
called off, my friend.

36:06.279 --> 36:09.680
No one is coming to help you.

36:13.286 --> 36:16.915
You might as well
come out and join the others.

36:19.292 --> 36:21.692
I promise
I won't hurt you.

36:50.958 --> 36:53.222
Drop it, dickhead.
It's the police.

36:53.327 --> 36:55.227
You won't hurt me.

36:55.329 --> 36:56.729
Yeah? Why not?

36:56.832 --> 36:59.232
Because
you're a policeman.

36:59.334 --> 37:01.666
There are rules
for policemen.

37:01.770 --> 37:06.139
Yeah. That's what
my captain keeps telling me.

37:32.302 --> 37:33.701
Aah!

38:12.409 --> 38:14.969
You bet your ass
I wish to proceed.

38:55.487 --> 38:57.149
Nine million terrorists
in the world,

38:57.256 --> 39:00.487
and I got to kill one
with feet smaller than my sister.

39:49.209 --> 39:52.042
I wanted this
to be professional,

39:52.145 --> 39:54.613
efficient, and cooperative.

39:54.715 --> 39:56.843
Not a lot to ask.

39:56.951 --> 39:59.852
Alas, Mr. Takagi
did not see it that way,

39:59.954 --> 40:04.857
so he won't be joining us
for the rest of his life.

40:04.959 --> 40:07.860
<i>We can go
any way you want it.</i>

40:07.962 --> 40:10.726
<i>You can walk out
or be carried out,</i>

40:10.832 --> 40:14.996
but have no illusions-
we are in charge.

40:15.103 --> 40:20.507
<i>So... decide now, each of you,</i>

40:20.608 --> 40:22.269
<i>And please remember...</i>

40:23.945 --> 40:26.005
<i>we have left nothing
to chance.</i>

40:34.123 --> 40:35.681
Get them back!

40:44.133 --> 40:47.830
" Now I have
a machine gun.

40:49.638 --> 40:52.766
<i>Ho-ho-ho. "</i>

40:55.645 --> 40:57.545
A security guard
we missed?

40:57.647 --> 41:00.480
They're usually
just growing fat on a pension.

41:00.583 --> 41:02.983
This is
something else.

41:11.995 --> 41:14.486
We have to do
something, Hans.

41:14.597 --> 41:16.121
Yes, we do.

41:16.232 --> 41:18.757
Tell Karl his brother is dead.

41:18.868 --> 41:20.733
Tell him
to come down.

41:20.837 --> 41:23.328
<i>Karl...
komm sofort.</i>

41:23.439 --> 41:29.003
<i>Franco,you and Fritz take
the body upstairs and out of sight.</i>

41:29.113 --> 41:31.172
<i>I don't want the hostages
to think too much.</i>

42:34.013 --> 42:35.480
Aah!

42:35.581 --> 42:37.310
I want blood!

42:37.416 --> 42:40.010
But let Heinrich
plant the detonators.

42:40.119 --> 42:43.020
The police will waste hours
trying to negotiate.

42:43.122 --> 42:46.023
Then you can
tear the building apart.

42:46.125 --> 42:49.356
But until then,
do not alter the plan.

42:49.462 --> 42:51.987
And if he alters it?

42:56.136 --> 42:58.229
What do you think?

43:00.574 --> 43:02.474
Something's wrong.

43:02.576 --> 43:03.975
Cops?

43:05.579 --> 43:06.978
John.

43:07.080 --> 43:10.345
<i>John-Aw, Christ!
He can fuck this whole thing up!</i>

43:10.450 --> 43:12.441
<i>What does
he think he's doing?</i>

43:12.552 --> 43:13.849
His job.

43:13.954 --> 43:16.354
Bullshit. His job's
3,000 miles away.

43:16.456 --> 43:20.859
Without him, we might
be able to get out of here.

43:20.961 --> 43:24.363
Tell that to Takagi.

43:47.488 --> 43:50.218
Mayday. Mayday,
Anyone copying channel nine.

43:50.325 --> 43:52.725
Terrorists have seized
the Nakatomi Building...

43:52.827 --> 43:54.318
<i>and are holding
30 hostages.</i>

43:54.430 --> 43:56.523
<i>Unknown number
of terrorists-</i>

43:56.632 --> 43:59.931
Six or more armed
with automatic weapons.

44:00.035 --> 44:03.232
Where's the best place
to transmit?

44:03.339 --> 44:04.670
<i>- Somebody answer me, goddamn it!
- The roof!</i>

44:04.773 --> 44:06.240
<i>Go! Go!</i>

44:08.811 --> 44:11.245
<i>It's the same
address as that fire signal.</i>

44:11.347 --> 44:12.746
I'll handle it.

44:14.850 --> 44:16.750
Attention,
whoever you are,

44:16.852 --> 44:19.252
this channel
is reserved for emergencies.

44:19.355 --> 44:20.822
No shit, lady!

44:20.923 --> 44:22.823
I'm not ordering
a pizza!

44:34.504 --> 44:37.268
No one kills him
but me.

44:39.342 --> 44:41.276
They have
killed one hostage.

44:41.378 --> 44:43.107
They are fortifying
their positions...

44:43.213 --> 44:44.680
while you're jerking
me off on the radio!

44:44.781 --> 44:46.772
Sir, I've
already told you.

44:46.883 --> 44:48.783
This is
a reserved channel.

44:48.885 --> 44:52.286
If this is
an emergency call, dial 911.

44:52.389 --> 44:56.349
Otherwise, I'll report
this as an FCC violation.

44:56.460 --> 45:00.453
Fine! Come and arrest me,
just send the police now!

45:02.066 --> 45:03.431
Ow!

45:13.944 --> 45:18.677
See if there's a
black-and-white to do a drive-by.

45:28.860 --> 45:31.192
Thought you guys
just ate doughnuts.

45:31.296 --> 45:33.821
They're for my wife.

45:33.932 --> 45:35.866
Yeah.

45:35.967 --> 45:37.798
She's pregnant.

45:37.903 --> 45:39.427
Yeah.

45:39.538 --> 45:42.302
Bag it.

45:42.407 --> 45:44.307
Big time.

45:46.978 --> 45:48.377
Thanks.

45:51.483 --> 45:53.884
Dispatch
to 8-Lincoln-30. Over.

45:53.986 --> 45:56.386
This is 8-Lincoln-30.
Come on in. Over.

45:56.489 --> 45:57.888
Investigate a Code 2...

45:57.990 --> 45:59.890
at Nakatomi Plaza,
Century City.

45:59.992 --> 46:01.658
8- Lincoln-30 to dispatch.
I'm on my way.

46:01.693 --> 46:03.324
8- Lincoln-30 to dispatch.
I'm on my way.

48:01.918 --> 48:03.317
Girls.

48:18.935 --> 48:22.736
Shit! Where the fuck?

48:43.461 --> 48:44.860
Oh, my God.

49:00.912 --> 49:02.812
He's in the elevator shaft.

49:04.516 --> 49:06.814
Perfect.
The elevators are locked off.

49:06.918 --> 49:09.682
Just shut him in
and come back down.

49:13.425 --> 49:14.824
Oh, fuck.

49:20.799 --> 49:23.098
Karl, the police
are probably...

49:23.202 --> 49:25.067
on their way already.

49:45.958 --> 49:47.357
Christ.

49:52.633 --> 49:54.931
I can stall them but not
if they hear gunshots.

49:55.035 --> 49:57.503
If you lock him in,
he'll be neutralized-

51:01.404 --> 51:04.066
Come out to the coast!

51:04.173 --> 51:06.300
We'll get together,
have a few laughs.

51:13.349 --> 51:17.012
Now I know
what a TV dinner feels like.

51:26.396 --> 51:28.296
<i>Such!</i>

52:23.956 --> 52:26.117
<i>Karl, komm!
Die polizei!</i>

52:26.225 --> 52:27.852
<i>Die polizei!</i>

53:11.671 --> 53:14.071
Well, it's about time.

53:20.180 --> 53:22.080
No signs
of disturbance, dispatch.

53:22.182 --> 53:23.979
Possible crank call.

53:24.084 --> 53:26.075
<i>Check the area
and confirm.</i>

53:32.026 --> 53:34.824
Who's driving this car?
Stevie Wonder?

53:36.597 --> 53:38.690
I see a guard inside.

53:38.799 --> 53:41.597
<i>I'm going in
for a closer look.</i>

53:41.702 --> 53:43.101
<i>Use caution.</i>

53:46.206 --> 53:47.503
Eddie?

53:47.608 --> 53:50.100
I had a feelin'
you'd be callin'.

54:13.168 --> 54:16.194
Evenin', Officer.
What can I do for you?

54:24.680 --> 54:27.615
Heh heh heh!

54:27.717 --> 54:30.584
We had
that false alarm, you know.

54:30.686 --> 54:32.586
That computer
sent you out...

54:32.688 --> 54:34.588
on another
wild-goose chase.

54:34.690 --> 54:36.089
They been chasing bugs...

54:36.192 --> 54:38.092
since they installed
this system.

54:38.194 --> 54:40.094
<i>Notre Dame
on top of USC-</i>

54:40.196 --> 54:41.663
Ah, shit!

54:41.764 --> 54:44.324
I got 50 bucks bet
on them assholes.

54:46.002 --> 54:50.064
<i>Come on, come on.
Where's the fucking cavalry?</i>

54:56.213 --> 54:57.339
Ah!

55:11.662 --> 55:13.254
Bah!

55:13.363 --> 55:15.388
<i>...was good for 52 yards.</i>

55:15.499 --> 55:17.399
Mind if I look around?

55:17.501 --> 55:19.402
Help yourself.

55:19.504 --> 55:21.904
<i>Seven seconds left
in this period.</i>

55:22.006 --> 55:25.442
<i>Seven to nothing,
Notre Dame.</i>

55:29.047 --> 55:30.912
Freeze, Motherfucker!

55:31.015 --> 55:32.346
Don't shoot!

55:32.450 --> 55:33.781
Drop it!

55:33.885 --> 55:35.284
Okay! Don't shoot!

55:35.386 --> 55:36.410
Drop it!

55:36.521 --> 55:38.045
Ah!

55:54.039 --> 55:55.939
Ah, the hell with this!

55:57.710 --> 55:59.234
Ah!

56:02.748 --> 56:04.716
Ah!

56:04.817 --> 56:07.377
You are dog now!

56:07.486 --> 56:10.512
No more table!
Where are you going, pal?

56:10.622 --> 56:13.216
Next time
you have a chance...

56:13.325 --> 56:14.849
to kill someone,

56:14.960 --> 56:17.121
don't hesitate.

56:22.402 --> 56:24.267
Thanks for the advice.

56:24.370 --> 56:26.270
Sorry to waste your time.

56:26.372 --> 56:27.771
No problem.

56:27.874 --> 56:29.307
Merry Christmas.

56:29.409 --> 56:30.706
Merry Christmas.

56:36.249 --> 56:40.151
# Oh, the weather outside
is frightful #

56:40.253 --> 56:42.585
# Dum de dum delightful #

56:45.258 --> 56:47.021
For the love-

56:49.663 --> 56:51.528
8- Lincoln-30
to dispatch.

56:51.632 --> 56:53.031
Go ahead.

56:53.134 --> 56:55.034
That's a wild-goose chase...

56:55.136 --> 56:56.535
here at Nakatomi Plaza.

56:56.637 --> 56:58.537
Everything here's okay.
Over.

56:58.639 --> 57:02.131
# But nobody has no place to go #

57:02.243 --> 57:05.906
# Let it snow, let it snow ##

57:07.815 --> 57:09.442
Goddamn it!
Jesus H. Christ!

57:17.224 --> 57:19.318
Welcome
to the party, pal!

57:19.427 --> 57:21.122
Goddamn it!

57:24.599 --> 57:25.998
<i># Turn up the heat #</i>

57:26.101 --> 57:27.659
<i># It's getting ready
to pop ##</i>

57:27.769 --> 57:32.365
Police under automatic
rifle fire at Nakatomi!

57:32.474 --> 57:34.465
I need back-up assistance now!

57:34.576 --> 57:37.067
Now, Goddamn it! Now!

57:55.665 --> 57:58.361
Monica,
I can get us a table.

57:58.467 --> 58:01.300
Wolfgang and I
are very close friends.

58:01.404 --> 58:03.804
I interviewed him,
for God's sake.

58:03.906 --> 58:05.305
<i>...Nakatomi.</i>

58:05.408 --> 58:07.308
<i>Repeat.
Officer needs assistance at-</i>

58:07.410 --> 58:11.813
<i>I'm at Nakatomi Plaza. They're
turning my car into Swiss cheese!</i>

58:11.914 --> 58:13.814
<i>I need
back-up assistance now!</i>

58:13.916 --> 58:15.975
<i>Now, Goddamn it! Now!</i>

58:35.939 --> 58:38.999
Never thought I'd love
to hear that sound.

58:39.109 --> 58:41.077
All of you relax.

58:41.178 --> 58:44.079
This is a matter
of inconvenient timing.

58:44.181 --> 58:46.081
Police action was inevitable...

58:46.183 --> 58:48.584
and, as it happens,
necessary.

58:48.686 --> 58:51.587
Let them fumble about outside,
and stay calm.

58:51.689 --> 58:53.350
This is simply the beginning.

58:54.659 --> 58:58.925
I thought I told all of you
I want radio silence.

58:59.030 --> 59:01.624
I didn't get
that message, Hans.

59:01.733 --> 59:05.100
You should have put it
on the bulletin board.

59:05.203 --> 59:08.502
Since I waxed Tony and Marco
and his friend,

59:08.606 --> 59:12.736
I figured you and Karl
and Franco might be lonely.

59:12.844 --> 59:15.506
How does he know
so much-

59:15.613 --> 59:18.981
That's very kind of you.

59:19.084 --> 59:21.985
I assume you are
our mysterious party crasher.

59:22.087 --> 59:26.285
You are most troublesome
for a security guard.

59:26.392 --> 59:29.190
Eeeh! Sorry, Hans.
Wrong guess.

59:29.295 --> 59:31.957
Want to go
for DoubleJeopardy,

59:32.064 --> 59:34.532
where the scores
can really change?

59:36.635 --> 59:39.468
Mm, these are
very bad for you.

59:39.571 --> 59:41.937
Who are you, then?

59:42.041 --> 59:44.532
The fly in
the ointment, Hans.

59:44.643 --> 59:46.543
The monkey
in the wrench,

59:46.645 --> 59:48.546
the pain in the ass.

59:50.016 --> 59:51.540
Whoa!

59:52.953 --> 59:55.387
Don't use the radio.

59:55.488 --> 59:59.549
See if he's lying about Marco.
Find out who's missing.

01:00:03.296 --> 01:00:05.321
Mr. Mystery Guest,

01:00:05.432 --> 01:00:07.832
are you still there?

01:00:07.934 --> 01:00:09.834
Yeah, I'm still here,

01:00:09.936 --> 01:00:13.838
unless you want to open
the front door for me.

01:00:13.940 --> 01:00:15.407
I'm afraid not,

01:00:15.508 --> 01:00:17.409
but you have me
at a loss.

01:00:17.511 --> 01:00:20.105
You know my name,
but who are you?

01:00:20.214 --> 01:00:22.045
Just another American...

01:00:22.149 --> 01:00:24.845
who saw too many movies
as a child?

01:00:24.952 --> 01:00:27.386
Another orphan
of a bankrupt culture...

01:00:27.488 --> 01:00:30.787
who thinks he's
John Wayne, Rambo,

01:00:30.891 --> 01:00:32.358
Marshal Dillon?

01:00:32.460 --> 01:00:35.361
I was always partial
to Roy Rogers, actually.

01:00:35.463 --> 01:00:37.454
I liked those
sequined shirts.

01:00:37.565 --> 01:00:40.625
Do you think you have
a chance, Mr. Cowboy?

01:00:43.170 --> 01:00:46.162
Yippee-kai-yay,
motherfucker.

01:00:49.845 --> 01:00:52.211
I can get the jump
on everybody...

01:00:52.314 --> 01:00:53.975
with a remote.

01:00:54.082 --> 01:00:56.073
Harvey,
keep your pants on.

01:00:56.184 --> 01:00:58.084
Sam, I'm begging you.

01:00:58.186 --> 01:01:00.518
Simon's already out
with the remote.

01:01:00.622 --> 01:01:04.524
I'm not sitting on this!
I am going out there!

01:01:04.626 --> 01:01:07.026
You don't give me a truck,

01:01:07.129 --> 01:01:09.029
I'll steal a truck.

01:01:09.131 --> 01:01:11.497
Give us a break,
Thornburg.

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:12.760
Eat it, Harvey!

01:01:12.868 --> 01:01:15.200
Four, three, two...

01:01:15.303 --> 01:01:16.828
one.

01:01:16.939 --> 01:01:18.839
<i>Harvey, we're
on the air.</i>

01:01:21.811 --> 01:01:24.974
Good evening.
This is HarveyJohnson.

01:01:26.816 --> 01:01:28.943
And I'm Gail Wallens,

01:01:29.052 --> 01:01:31.577
<i>and this is
Nightline News at 10:00.</i>

01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:34.588
<i>Our top stories
on this Christmas eve-</i>

01:01:34.690 --> 01:01:37.591
Take truck number five.
Get out of here.

01:01:43.933 --> 01:01:46.026
He wasn't lying
about Marco.

01:01:46.135 --> 01:01:48.195
He's down
on the street.

01:01:48.305 --> 01:01:50.466
<i>The other man
was Heinrich,</i>

01:01:50.574 --> 01:01:53.065
and his bag
is missing.

01:01:53.177 --> 01:01:55.975
He had the detonator.

01:02:00.918 --> 01:02:01.850
Theo.

01:02:01.952 --> 01:02:02.976
Theo.

01:02:03.087 --> 01:02:04.315
Yo!

01:02:04.421 --> 01:02:06.321
We may have
some problems.

01:02:06.423 --> 01:02:08.323
How's your schedule?

01:02:08.425 --> 01:02:10.325
Three down.
Four to go.

01:02:10.427 --> 01:02:13.328
Then don't waste time
talking to me.

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:16.332
This is sergeant Al Powell
of the L.A.P.D.

01:02:16.434 --> 01:02:19.597
If the person
who radioed can hear me,

01:02:19.704 --> 01:02:22.070
acknowledge
this transmission.

01:02:22.173 --> 01:02:24.004
I say again-

01:02:24.109 --> 01:02:27.340
If the person who radioed
can hear me,

01:02:27.445 --> 01:02:29.845
acknowledge
this transmission!

01:02:33.451 --> 01:02:36.909
I read you.
You the guy in the car?

01:02:37.021 --> 01:02:38.921
What's left of him.

01:02:39.023 --> 01:02:40.957
Can you identify
yourself?

01:02:41.059 --> 01:02:42.959
Not now.
Maybe later.

01:02:43.061 --> 01:02:44.961
This is a party line.

01:02:45.063 --> 01:02:47.464
The neighbor's got
itchy trigger fingers.

01:02:47.566 --> 01:02:50.194
You got 30 hostages
on the 30th floor.

01:02:50.302 --> 01:02:53.794
<i>- The leader's name is Hans.
- We have to find him and shut him up.</i>

01:02:53.906 --> 01:02:55.806
- He's telling them everything!
- Let him. I'm waiting for the FBI.

01:02:55.908 --> 01:02:58.138
Until then, he can waste
as much time as he likes,

01:02:58.244 --> 01:03:02.305
but we must find
the bag, Fritz.

01:03:02.414 --> 01:03:04.712
We must have
the detonators.

01:03:04.817 --> 01:03:06.808
<i>They got
missiles, automatic weapons,</i>

01:03:06.919 --> 01:03:09.410
<i>and enough explosives
to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.</i>

01:03:09.522 --> 01:03:11.820
They're down to nine now.

01:03:11.924 --> 01:03:14.324
These guys
are mostly European,

01:03:14.426 --> 01:03:16.827
judging by
their clothing labels and...

01:03:24.271 --> 01:03:25.670
cigarettes.

01:03:25.772 --> 01:03:28.332
They're well-financed
and very slick.

01:03:28.441 --> 01:03:30.341
How do you
know that?

01:03:30.443 --> 01:03:31.933
I've seen
enough phony I.D.s...

01:03:32.045 --> 01:03:37.005
to recognize that the ones
they got must have cost a fortune.

01:03:37.117 --> 01:03:38.516
Add all that up,

01:03:38.618 --> 01:03:40.449
I don't know
what the fuck it means,

01:03:40.554 --> 01:03:44.149
but you got some bad-ass
perpetrators here to stay.

01:03:44.257 --> 01:03:46.453
I hear you, partner.

01:03:46.561 --> 01:03:48.791
L.A.'s finest are on it.

01:03:48.896 --> 01:03:51.387
Light 'em
if you got 'em.

01:03:51.499 --> 01:03:53.797
Way ahead of you, partner.

01:03:53.901 --> 01:03:57.302
So, what do I call you?

01:03:57.405 --> 01:03:59.305
Call me...

01:04:00.575 --> 01:04:01.667
Roy.

01:04:01.776 --> 01:04:04.301
If you think of
anything else,

01:04:04.412 --> 01:04:06.312
don't you be shy, okay?

01:04:06.414 --> 01:04:09.815
In the meantime,
let us do our job.

01:04:09.917 --> 01:04:11.817
<i>They're all yours, Al.</i>

01:04:29.438 --> 01:04:31.906
All right,
who's talking to him?

01:04:32.007 --> 01:04:35.340
I am, sir. Sergeant Powell.
Al Powell.

01:04:35.444 --> 01:04:38.345
Dwayne Robinson, Powell.
What's the deal here?

01:04:38.447 --> 01:04:40.278
What do
these pricks want?

01:04:40.382 --> 01:04:42.282
Well, we don't exactly know.

01:04:42.384 --> 01:04:44.284
We haven't heard from them.

01:04:44.386 --> 01:04:46.821
Who have you been talking to?

01:04:46.923 --> 01:04:50.450
We don't know.
He won't give us his name.

01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:53.461
He appears to be
the one who phoned.

01:04:53.563 --> 01:04:55.292
He's killed
one terrorist,

01:04:55.398 --> 01:04:56.956
and he claims two others.

01:04:57.066 --> 01:04:59.967
Claims? Powell,
has it occurred to you...

01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:02.867
he could be one
of the terrorists...

01:05:02.972 --> 01:05:04.963
<i>or some nutcase in there?</i>

01:05:05.074 --> 01:05:07.872
No. In fact,
I think he's a cop-

01:05:07.977 --> 01:05:10.810
Maybe not L.A.P.D.,
but he's a badge.

01:05:10.913 --> 01:05:11.845
Why?

01:05:11.948 --> 01:05:14.314
A hunch,
things he said,

01:05:14.417 --> 01:05:17.546
like being able
to spot a phony I.D.

01:05:17.655 --> 01:05:21.716
Jesus Christ, Powell. He could be
a fucking bartender for all we know!

01:05:21.825 --> 01:05:23.816
TV's here.

01:05:23.927 --> 01:05:25.895
Oh, shit.

01:05:42.546 --> 01:05:44.343
I have a request.

01:05:44.448 --> 01:05:47.282
What idiot
put you in charge?

01:05:47.385 --> 01:05:48.852
You did...

01:05:48.953 --> 01:05:50.944
when you murdered
my boss.

01:05:51.056 --> 01:05:53.251
Now everybody's
looking to me.

01:05:53.358 --> 01:05:55.792
Personally,
I'd pass on the job.

01:05:55.894 --> 01:05:59.193
I don't enjoy being
this close to you.

01:06:06.905 --> 01:06:08.634
Go on.

01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:10.708
We have
a pregnant woman.

01:06:10.809 --> 01:06:13.676
Relax. She's not due
for a couple weeks,

01:06:13.778 --> 01:06:16.077
but sitting on that rock isn't
doing her back any good.

01:06:16.182 --> 01:06:20.346
So, I would like permission to move her
to one of the offices where there's a sofa.

01:06:20.453 --> 01:06:24.389
I'll have a sofa
brought out. Good enough?

01:06:24.490 --> 01:06:26.151
Good enough.

01:06:26.258 --> 01:06:28.192
Unless you
like it messy,

01:06:28.294 --> 01:06:30.592
start bringing us
in groups to the bathroom.

01:06:30.696 --> 01:06:33.722
Yes. You're right.

01:06:33.833 --> 01:06:36.461
<i>It will be done.</i>

01:06:36.569 --> 01:06:38.127
<i>Was there
something else?</i>

01:06:40.373 --> 01:06:42.500
No, thank you.

01:06:48.382 --> 01:06:51.442
Mr. Takagi chose
his people well, Mrs...

01:06:51.551 --> 01:06:53.280
Gennero.

01:06:55.222 --> 01:06:58.191
<i>Miss Gennero.</i>

01:07:00.127 --> 01:07:02.994
<i>We interrupt this program
for a special bulletin.</i>

01:07:03.096 --> 01:07:06.293
This is Richard Thornburg
live from Century City.

01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.800
Tonight, Los Angeles
has joined...

01:07:08.902 --> 01:07:11.803
the sad and worldwide
fraternity of cities...

01:07:11.905 --> 01:07:13.805
whose only
membership requirement...

01:07:13.907 --> 01:07:17.309
<i>is to suffer the anguish
of international terrorism.</i>

01:07:17.412 --> 01:07:19.312
<i>Approximately
two hours ago,</i>

01:07:19.414 --> 01:07:21.314
<i>an unidentified
group of men...</i>

01:07:21.416 --> 01:07:23.816
<i>seized control
of the Nakatomi Building,</i>

01:07:23.918 --> 01:07:26.318
<i>sealing off
all entrances and exits.</i>

01:07:26.421 --> 01:07:29.185
<i>All telephone lines
have been cut,</i>

01:07:29.290 --> 01:07:31.485
and the only communication
now possible...

01:07:31.592 --> 01:07:34.652
<i>has been through the use
of CB communicators,</i>

01:07:34.762 --> 01:07:36.992
<i>the group apparently
brought with them.</i>

01:07:37.098 --> 01:07:39.089
<i>According to
official sources,</i>

01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:41.532
<i>the perpetrators
of this building siege...</i>

01:07:41.636 --> 01:07:44.401
Unit Five, hold your position.

01:07:44.506 --> 01:07:46.770
<i>We got Charlie Unit
in position...</i>

01:07:46.875 --> 01:07:48.502
<i>by the parking structure.</i>

01:07:48.610 --> 01:07:50.441
Let me ask you something.

01:07:50.546 --> 01:07:53.447
Does this stairway
go up to the escalator?

01:07:53.549 --> 01:07:54.777
Yeah.

01:07:54.883 --> 01:07:56.783
Tell them to go ahead.

01:07:56.885 --> 01:07:58.284
What's going on?

01:07:58.387 --> 01:08:01.288
What's it look like?
We're going in.

01:08:01.390 --> 01:08:03.449
Going in?
Man, that's crazy!

01:08:03.559 --> 01:08:06.289
There could be
over 30 hostages!

01:08:06.395 --> 01:08:08.295
We don't know shit,
Powell.

01:08:08.397 --> 01:08:11.298
How come there were
no ransom demands?

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:13.630
Where's their list
of demands?

01:08:13.735 --> 01:08:16.636
All we know is
somebody shot your car.

01:08:16.738 --> 01:08:19.537
It's probably the same
son of a bitch...

01:08:19.642 --> 01:08:21.473
<i>you've been
talking to on that radio.</i>

01:08:21.578 --> 01:08:23.307
Excuse me, sir.

01:08:23.412 --> 01:08:26.746
What about the body
that fell out the window?

01:08:26.850 --> 01:08:29.318
Probably some stockbroker-
Got depressed.

01:08:29.419 --> 01:08:30.818
Let's go.

01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:32.319
Hit your lights.

01:08:32.421 --> 01:08:33.821
<i>Let's go.</i>

01:08:33.923 --> 01:08:35.185
<i>Lights on!</i>

01:08:47.203 --> 01:08:49.104
Powell?

01:08:49.206 --> 01:08:52.232
You still with me, babe?
What's going on?

01:08:52.343 --> 01:08:54.310
Yo, Al.

01:08:54.411 --> 01:08:58.142
I'm kind of busy.
I'll talk to you later.

01:08:58.249 --> 01:08:59.773
Al, what's wrong?

01:08:59.884 --> 01:09:00.975
We'll talk later.

01:09:01.085 --> 01:09:04.054
If you are what
I think you are,

01:09:04.154 --> 01:09:06.952
you'll know when
to listen, shut up,

01:09:07.057 --> 01:09:09.149
and when to pray.

01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:11.490
Jesus Christ!
You're coming in.

01:09:11.595 --> 01:09:15.032
<i>I told you what kind
of people they are.</i>

01:09:15.133 --> 01:09:17.294
<i>Let's load them up.
Blue go.</i>

01:09:19.904 --> 01:09:23.238
They'll be coming.
Everyone get ready.

01:09:23.341 --> 01:09:26.310
Theo, you are
the eyes now.

01:09:39.323 --> 01:09:42.417
Rivers, begin
your reconnoiter.

01:09:48.401 --> 01:09:49.765
Shit!

01:10:09.288 --> 01:10:12.280
Hey, come on, man.
Let's go.

01:10:21.401 --> 01:10:23.096
Ow!Jesus!

01:10:57.305 --> 01:10:59.273
All right, spread out.

01:11:25.634 --> 01:11:27.295
Shut up.

01:11:28.575 --> 01:11:30.270
Let's go.

01:11:34.781 --> 01:11:37.306
You macho assholes.
No! No!

01:11:40.387 --> 01:11:43.152
Ahem... all right.
Listen up, guys.

01:11:43.258 --> 01:11:46.716
'Twas the night
before Christmas,

01:11:46.828 --> 01:11:49.194
and all through the house,

01:11:49.297 --> 01:11:51.322
not a creature
was stirring, except...

01:11:51.432 --> 01:11:54.367
the four assholes
coming in the rear...

01:11:54.469 --> 01:11:56.164
in standard
cover formation.

01:11:58.339 --> 01:11:59.931
We're all set.

01:12:00.041 --> 01:12:01.906
We're ready.

01:12:03.344 --> 01:12:04.902
Kick ass.

01:12:05.013 --> 01:12:05.945
Go.

01:12:06.047 --> 01:12:07.947
Right.
Let's do it.

01:12:25.134 --> 01:12:27.034
They're shooting
at them.

01:12:27.136 --> 01:12:29.127
It's panic fire.
They can't see.

01:12:29.238 --> 01:12:31.001
They're shooting
at the lights.

01:12:35.077 --> 01:12:37.011
They're going
after the lights.

01:12:37.112 --> 01:12:38.909
<i>Pull them back.</i>

01:12:39.014 --> 01:12:40.914
It's not happening.

01:12:41.016 --> 01:12:42.484
Mike, burn it.

01:12:44.888 --> 01:12:46.515
Don't be impatient.

01:12:46.623 --> 01:12:49.353
Just wound them.

01:12:51.127 --> 01:12:53.095
They're sitting ducks
without lights.

01:12:53.196 --> 01:12:54.527
They're almost in.

01:12:54.631 --> 01:12:56.861
<i>Send in the car.</i>

01:12:56.967 --> 01:12:58.500
Send in the car.

01:13:11.881 --> 01:13:13.179
Jesus Christ!

01:13:16.454 --> 01:13:19.184
Rivers, Rodriguez,
report.

01:13:19.290 --> 01:13:22.088
Whoa! Wait a minute.
What have we here, gentlemen?

01:13:26.263 --> 01:13:28.788
The police
have themselves an RV.

01:13:34.238 --> 01:13:35.398
Southeast corner.

01:13:47.419 --> 01:13:50.445
Oh,Jesus Christ.

01:14:00.999 --> 01:14:05.026
Get back!
Get the fuck back!

01:14:07.039 --> 01:14:08.028
Get over there!

01:14:08.140 --> 01:14:10.267
<i>Schnell! Schnell!</i>

01:14:10.375 --> 01:14:13.470
<i>Mach schnell!</i>

01:14:13.579 --> 01:14:15.945
<i>Weiter! Weiter!
Weiter!</i>

01:14:16.049 --> 01:14:18.108
<i>Mach schnell!
Mach schnell!</i>

01:14:18.217 --> 01:14:20.082
<i>Weiter!</i>

01:14:22.722 --> 01:14:24.986
<i>Mach los! Mach los!</i>

01:14:43.711 --> 01:14:45.144
I see him!

01:15:04.631 --> 01:15:07.532
Oh, my God!
The quarterback is toast!

01:15:07.634 --> 01:15:10.626
Hang on, Rivers.
That's an order.

01:15:10.738 --> 01:15:12.934
Hit it again.

01:15:13.041 --> 01:15:16.272
Hans, you motherfucker! You made
your point! Let them pull back!

01:15:16.377 --> 01:15:18.741
Thank you, Mr. Cowboy. I'll take
it under advisement. Hit it again!

01:15:18.776 --> 01:15:21.105
Thank you, Mr. Cowboy. I'll take
it under advisement. Hit it again!

01:15:33.862 --> 01:15:35.887
Fire.

01:15:50.613 --> 01:15:52.513
Fuck me.

01:15:52.615 --> 01:15:55.083
Get them out of the car.

01:15:56.519 --> 01:15:58.578
- Aah!
- Aah!

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:05.957
Fuck it.

01:16:08.931 --> 01:16:10.660
<i>Mach schnell!
Mach los!</i>

01:16:17.541 --> 01:16:20.942
Let's see you take this
under advisement,jerkweed.

01:16:25.015 --> 01:16:27.643
Geronimo,
motherfucker.

01:16:46.504 --> 01:16:47.402
Shit!

01:16:52.410 --> 01:16:54.344
They're using
artillery on us!

01:16:54.445 --> 01:16:56.913
You idiot,
it's not the police.

01:16:57.014 --> 01:16:58.743
It's him.

01:17:06.023 --> 01:17:07.513
Holy shit.

01:17:12.998 --> 01:17:14.590
My God.

01:17:16.034 --> 01:17:17.934
Tell me you got that.

01:17:18.036 --> 01:17:20.436
I got it.
I got it.

01:17:20.539 --> 01:17:23.406
Eat your heart out,
Channel Five.

01:17:23.508 --> 01:17:27.342
We've had an update on the
takeover of the Nakatomi Building-

01:17:27.446 --> 01:17:29.437
Sources say
the terrorist leader, " Hans,"

01:17:29.548 --> 01:17:31.948
may be this man-
Hans Gruber,

01:17:32.050 --> 01:17:34.951
<i>a member of the radical
West German Volksfrei movement.</i>

01:17:35.053 --> 01:17:36.953
<i>Strangely,
the Volksfrei leadership...</i>

01:17:37.055 --> 01:17:39.387
issued a communique
an hour ago...

01:17:39.491 --> 01:17:41.585
stating Gruber had been expelled
from that organization-

01:17:41.694 --> 01:17:43.491
Al? Al? Do you copy?

01:17:43.596 --> 01:17:45.564
Are you all right?

01:17:45.665 --> 01:17:47.155
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:17:49.035 --> 01:17:50.502
What was that?

01:17:50.603 --> 01:17:53.401
Remember that plastic
explosive I told you about?

01:17:53.506 --> 01:17:56.407
There you go.
Is the building on fire?

01:17:56.509 --> 01:17:59.342
No, but it's going to
need a paint job.

01:17:59.445 --> 01:18:02.346
Our spotter said
you got two that time.

01:18:02.448 --> 01:18:04.177
Is that him?

01:18:04.284 --> 01:18:05.683
Yes, sir.

01:18:05.785 --> 01:18:08.686
I don't know
who you think you are,

01:18:08.788 --> 01:18:12.281
but you just destroyed
a building.

01:18:12.393 --> 01:18:15.521
We do not want your help.
Is that clear?

01:18:15.629 --> 01:18:18.029
I've got 100 people
down here,

01:18:18.132 --> 01:18:20.032
and they're covered
with glass.

01:18:20.134 --> 01:18:22.364
Who gives a shit
about glass?

01:18:22.469 --> 01:18:24.460
Who the fuck is this?

01:18:24.571 --> 01:18:27.540
This is deputy chief of police,
Dwayne T. Robinson,

01:18:27.641 --> 01:18:30.940
and I am in charge
of this situation.

01:18:31.045 --> 01:18:32.535
Oh, you're in charge?

01:18:32.646 --> 01:18:34.876
I got bad news
for you, Dwayne.

01:18:34.982 --> 01:18:38.213
It doesn't look like you're
in charge of jack shit.

01:18:38.319 --> 01:18:41.289
- Listen to me, you little asshole-
- Asshole?

01:18:41.389 --> 01:18:46.019
I'm not the one who just got
buttfucked on national TV, Dwayne!

01:18:46.127 --> 01:18:48.288
<i>Listen to me,jerkoff,</i>

01:18:48.396 --> 01:18:51.365
quit being part
of the fucking problem...

01:18:51.466 --> 01:18:54.367
and put the other guy
back on!

01:18:56.972 --> 01:18:59.167
Hey, Roy, how are
you feeling?

01:18:59.274 --> 01:19:01.037
Pretty fucking
unappreciated, Al.

01:19:01.142 --> 01:19:02.871
Hey, look.
I love you.

01:19:02.978 --> 01:19:05.913
So do a lot
of the other guys.

01:19:06.014 --> 01:19:08.380
You hang in there.
You hear me?

01:19:08.483 --> 01:19:10.543
You hang in there.

01:19:11.988 --> 01:19:15.014
Yeah, thanks, partner.

01:19:19.495 --> 01:19:21.395
What are you doing?

01:19:21.497 --> 01:19:23.897
I'm tired
of waiting to see...

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:27.231
who gets us killed first-
them or your husband.

01:19:27.336 --> 01:19:29.031
What are you
going to do?

01:19:29.138 --> 01:19:32.403
Hey, babe, I negotiate
million-dollar deals for breakfast.

01:19:32.508 --> 01:19:34.999
I think I can
handle this " Euro-trash. "

01:19:35.111 --> 01:19:37.579
<i>Hey,
sprechen sie, talk?</i>

01:19:37.680 --> 01:19:40.411
If you'd listened to me,
he'd be neutralized.

01:19:40.517 --> 01:19:43.418
<i>I don't want neutral. I want dead.</i>

01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:45.681
Hope I'm not
interrupting.

01:19:45.789 --> 01:19:46.813
What does he want?

01:19:46.923 --> 01:19:48.584
It's not
what I want.

01:19:48.692 --> 01:19:51.092
It's what
I can give you.

01:19:58.035 --> 01:20:00.333
<i>Oy, let's be
straight, okay?</i>

01:20:00.437 --> 01:20:02.428
It's obvious you're not
some dumb schmuck up here...

01:20:02.539 --> 01:20:05.099
to snatch a few purses,
am I right?

01:20:05.208 --> 01:20:06.766
Very perceptive.

01:20:06.877 --> 01:20:08.435
<i>I watch
60 Minutes.</i>

01:20:08.545 --> 01:20:11.276
I say to myself,
"these guys are professional,

01:20:11.382 --> 01:20:13.282
"they're motivated,
they're happening,

01:20:13.384 --> 01:20:15.477
i. e., they want
something," huh?

01:20:15.586 --> 01:20:18.384
<i>I couldn't care less
about your politics.</i>

01:20:18.489 --> 01:20:20.616
Maybe you're pissed off
at the camel jockeys,

01:20:20.725 --> 01:20:22.283
maybe it's the Hebes,
Northern Ireland-

01:20:22.393 --> 01:20:23.451
It's none
of my business.

01:20:23.561 --> 01:20:26.155
I figure you're here to negotiate.
Am I right?

01:20:26.264 --> 01:20:27.663
You're amazing.

01:20:27.765 --> 01:20:29.756
You figured this
all out already?

01:20:29.867 --> 01:20:31.630
Hey, business
is business.

01:20:31.736 --> 01:20:34.637
You use a gun. I use a fountain
pen. What's the difference?

01:20:34.739 --> 01:20:36.969
Let's put it
in my terms.

01:20:37.075 --> 01:20:39.203
You're here on a hostile takeover.
You grab us for some greenmail,

01:20:39.311 --> 01:20:42.610
<i>but you didn't expect
some poison pill running around.</i>

01:20:42.714 --> 01:20:45.410
Am I right?

01:20:45.517 --> 01:20:49.078
Hans, bubby, I'm
your white knight.

01:20:49.188 --> 01:20:51.748
<i>I must have missed
60 Minutes.</i>

01:20:51.857 --> 01:20:53.950
What are you saying?

01:20:56.028 --> 01:20:59.088
The guy upstairs is
fucking things up, huh?

01:21:03.535 --> 01:21:05.935
I can give him to you.

01:21:08.674 --> 01:21:10.734
<i>Oh, God...</i>

01:21:10.844 --> 01:21:11.936
Uhh...

01:21:12.045 --> 01:21:12.943
Roy?

01:21:13.046 --> 01:21:15.207
Roy,
you all right?

01:21:15.315 --> 01:21:18.944
Just trying to fire down
a 1,000-year-old Twinkie.

01:21:19.052 --> 01:21:22.021
What do they put
in these things anyway?

01:21:22.122 --> 01:21:24.682
Sugar, enriched flour,

01:21:24.791 --> 01:21:26.691
partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil,

01:21:26.793 --> 01:21:28.954
polysorbate 60...

01:21:29.062 --> 01:21:31.189
and yellow dye
number five-

01:21:31.297 --> 01:21:33.697
Just everything
a growing boy needs.

01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:36.200
How many kids
you got, Al?

01:21:36.302 --> 01:21:40.364
My wife is working
on our first.

01:21:40.474 --> 01:21:42.533
How about you,
cowboy?

01:21:42.643 --> 01:21:44.508
You got any kids?

01:21:45.813 --> 01:21:49.078
Yeah... two.

01:21:49.183 --> 01:21:53.279
Hope I can see 'em swingin' on
a jungle gym with AIJr. someday.

01:21:55.322 --> 01:21:57.222
Well, now,
that's a date,

01:21:57.324 --> 01:22:00.225
but you bring
the ice cream.

01:22:00.327 --> 01:22:02.227
<i>Touching, cowboy. Touching.</i>

01:22:02.329 --> 01:22:04.661
<i>Or should I call you...</i>

01:22:04.765 --> 01:22:07.563
Mr. McClane.?

01:22:07.668 --> 01:22:10.900
Mr. OfficerJohn McClane...

01:22:11.006 --> 01:22:14.601
<i>of the New York
Police Department?</i>

01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:17.542
- Get on the phone to Harry in New York. Come on, baby. Move.!
- Got it.

01:22:17.646 --> 01:22:19.876
Better get a hold
of somebody at dispatch.

01:22:19.981 --> 01:22:23.747
Sister Theresa called me
Mr. McClane in the third grade,

01:22:23.852 --> 01:22:25.752
my friends call meJohn,

01:22:25.854 --> 01:22:28.880
and you're neither,
shithead.

01:22:28.990 --> 01:22:32.756
I have someone
who wants to talk to you-

01:22:32.861 --> 01:22:35.489
A very special friend...

01:22:35.597 --> 01:22:38.088
<i>who was with you
at the party tonight.</i>

01:22:43.806 --> 01:22:46.206
Hey,John boy.

01:22:47.476 --> 01:22:48.534
Ellis?

01:22:48.644 --> 01:22:50.544
Yeah.
Now, listen,John.

01:22:50.646 --> 01:22:52.614
They're giving me
a few minutes...

01:22:52.715 --> 01:22:54.649
to try to talk
some sense into you.

01:22:54.750 --> 01:22:57.742
I know you think
you're doin' your job,

01:22:57.853 --> 01:23:00.617
but you're just
draggin' this thing out.

01:23:00.723 --> 01:23:04.124
<i>No one gets out of here
until these guys can talk...</i>

01:23:04.227 --> 01:23:05.626
to the L.A. police, and that
just ain't gonna happen...

01:23:05.728 --> 01:23:07.889
<i>till you stop messing up
the works, capisci?</i>

01:23:12.736 --> 01:23:15.227
Ellis, what have
you told them?

01:23:15.339 --> 01:23:19.332
I told them
we were old friends,

01:23:19.443 --> 01:23:21.638
and you were
my guest.

01:23:21.745 --> 01:23:23.940
You shouldn't
be doing this.

01:23:24.047 --> 01:23:25.708
Tell me about it.

01:23:31.655 --> 01:23:33.623
All right,John,
listen.

01:23:33.724 --> 01:23:36.716
They want you to tell them
where the detonators are.

01:23:36.827 --> 01:23:39.160
They know people
are listening.

01:23:39.264 --> 01:23:40.993
They want
the detonators,

01:23:41.099 --> 01:23:43.260
or they're
going to kill me.

01:23:45.670 --> 01:23:48.230
John, didn't you
hear me?

01:23:50.441 --> 01:23:52.602
Yeah, I hear you.

01:23:52.710 --> 01:23:54.337
John, get
with the program.

01:23:54.445 --> 01:23:55.844
Tell these guys...

01:23:55.947 --> 01:23:57.346
where
the detonators are...

01:23:57.448 --> 01:23:59.507
so no one else
gets hurt!

01:23:59.617 --> 01:24:02.518
I'm putting my life
on the line, pal!

01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:04.349
Ellis,
listen to me carefully.

01:24:04.455 --> 01:24:05.717
John-

01:24:05.823 --> 01:24:07.689
Shut up, Ellis!
Just shut your mouth!

01:24:07.793 --> 01:24:09.988
Put Hans back on!

01:24:10.095 --> 01:24:14.191
Hans, this shithead doesn't
know you, but I do-

01:24:14.300 --> 01:24:17.201
Good. Then you'll
give us what we want.

01:24:17.303 --> 01:24:19.703
You're not part
of this equation.

01:24:19.805 --> 01:24:22.831
What am I,
a method actor?

01:24:22.941 --> 01:24:24.340
Put away the gun.

01:24:24.443 --> 01:24:26.206
This is radio,
not television.

01:24:26.312 --> 01:24:29.713
Hans, he's not my friend!
I don't know him!

01:24:29.815 --> 01:24:31.715
Jesus, Ellis!
They'll kill you!

01:24:31.817 --> 01:24:34.047
Tell them
you don't know me!

01:24:34.153 --> 01:24:37.612
How can you say that
after all these years?

01:24:37.724 --> 01:24:41.660
John? John?

01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:05.513
Do you hear that?

01:25:05.618 --> 01:25:08.679
Talk to me! Where
are my detonators?

01:25:08.789 --> 01:25:10.188
Where are they,

01:25:10.291 --> 01:25:12.282
or shall I shoot
another one?

01:25:12.393 --> 01:25:13.792
Sooner or later,

01:25:13.894 --> 01:25:16.192
I'll get to someone
you care about.

01:25:16.297 --> 01:25:18.527
Go fuck
yourself, Hans.

01:25:20.768 --> 01:25:22.429
Did you hear that?

01:25:22.536 --> 01:25:25.699
He just let
the guy die, man.

01:25:25.806 --> 01:25:28.206
Man, can't you see
what's happening?

01:25:28.309 --> 01:25:30.709
Can't you read
between the lines?

01:25:30.811 --> 01:25:32.210
He did everything
he could...

01:25:32.313 --> 01:25:33.712
to save him.

01:25:33.814 --> 01:25:36.715
If he gave up,
they'd both be dead!

01:25:36.817 --> 01:25:39.150
No. They'd be
talking to us.

01:25:39.254 --> 01:25:42.655
You tell your partner
to stay out of this.

01:25:42.758 --> 01:25:44.157
If he doesn't,

01:25:44.259 --> 01:25:45.658
I'm going to
nail his ass.

01:25:45.761 --> 01:25:47.661
The man is hurting.

01:25:47.763 --> 01:25:49.663
He is alone, tired,

01:25:49.765 --> 01:25:51.858
and he hasn't seen
diddly-squat...

01:25:51.967 --> 01:25:53.366
from anybody here!

01:25:53.468 --> 01:25:56.164
You think
he'll give a damn...

01:25:56.271 --> 01:25:59.206
<i>about what you do
if he makes it?</i>

01:25:59.307 --> 01:26:02.003
Wake up and smell
what you shoveling.

01:26:02.110 --> 01:26:05.011
Anytime you want
to go home,

01:26:05.113 --> 01:26:07.480
you consider
yourself dismissed.

01:26:07.583 --> 01:26:10.177
No, sir.
You couldn't drag me away.

01:26:10.286 --> 01:26:10.852
<i>Attention, police.</i>

01:26:10.887 --> 01:26:12.184
<i>Attention, police.</i>

01:26:13.456 --> 01:26:16.050
Attention, police.

01:26:16.159 --> 01:26:18.354
This is Sergeant
Al Powell-

01:26:18.461 --> 01:26:20.861
This is deputy chief
Dwayne Robinson.

01:26:20.963 --> 01:26:22.897
Who is this?

01:26:22.999 --> 01:26:24.523
This is Hans Gruber.

01:26:24.634 --> 01:26:27.865
I assume you realize
the futility of direct action.

01:26:27.970 --> 01:26:31.303
We have no wish
for further loss of life.

01:26:31.407 --> 01:26:34.399
Well, what is it
you do wish for?

01:26:34.510 --> 01:26:36.706
I have comrades
around the world...

01:26:36.814 --> 01:26:38.543
languishing
in prison.

01:26:38.649 --> 01:26:40.480
The American
State Department...

01:26:40.584 --> 01:26:42.984
enjoys rattling its saber
for itself.

01:26:43.086 --> 01:26:45.987
Now it can rattle it
for me.

01:26:46.089 --> 01:26:49.650
The following are to be
released from their captors-

01:26:49.760 --> 01:26:53.457
The seven members
of the New Provo Front,

01:26:53.564 --> 01:26:58.126
<i>in Canada, the five imprisoned
leaders of Liberté du Quebec,</i>

01:26:58.235 --> 01:27:01.671
in Sri Lanka, the nine members
of the Asian Dawn.

01:27:01.772 --> 01:27:03.706
What the fuck?

01:27:05.809 --> 01:27:08.506
<i>I read about them
in Time magazine.</i>

01:27:08.613 --> 01:27:12.014
When these revolutionary
brothers and sisters are free,

01:27:12.116 --> 01:27:15.017
the hostages will be
taken to the roof...

01:27:15.119 --> 01:27:17.519
and will accompany us
in helicopters...

01:27:17.622 --> 01:27:20.022
to the Los Angeles
International Airport...

01:27:20.124 --> 01:27:22.354
where they'll be given
further instructions.

01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:25.020
You have two hours
to comply.

01:27:25.129 --> 01:27:26.858
Wait a minute,
Mr. Gruber.

01:27:26.965 --> 01:27:28.364
This is crazy.

01:27:28.466 --> 01:27:29.865
I don't have
the authority.

01:27:29.968 --> 01:27:32.368
Two hours
is not enough.

01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:35.701
Hello? Hello!

01:27:35.807 --> 01:27:37.708
Did you get
all that?

01:27:37.810 --> 01:27:40.005
We got to make
some calls.

01:27:40.112 --> 01:27:42.273
Do you think
they'll try?

01:27:42.381 --> 01:27:43.814
Who cares?

01:27:46.752 --> 01:27:48.947
Theo, are we
on schedule?

01:27:49.054 --> 01:27:51.750
One more. Then
it's up to you.

01:27:51.857 --> 01:27:54.451
This one will
take a miracle.

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:55.959
It's Christmas, Theo.

01:27:56.061 --> 01:27:59.258
It's the time of miracles,
so be of good cheer.

01:27:59.365 --> 01:28:02.266
Call me when you hit
the last lock.

01:28:02.368 --> 01:28:07.102
Hunt that little shit down
and get those detonators.

01:28:07.207 --> 01:28:10.301
Fritz is checking
the explosives.

01:28:10.410 --> 01:28:12.071
I'll check
the explosives.

01:28:12.178 --> 01:28:14.510
Hey, Powell,
you out there?

01:28:14.614 --> 01:28:17.742
I'm here,John.
I'm here.

01:28:17.851 --> 01:28:21.287
Believe me, there was
nothing I could do.

01:28:21.388 --> 01:28:23.788
It's gonna be
both our asses...

01:28:23.890 --> 01:28:25.414
if you're wrong.

01:28:25.525 --> 01:28:27.186
I hear you.

01:28:32.299 --> 01:28:35.325
Did you catch that bullshit
Hans was running?

01:28:35.435 --> 01:28:37.700
It doesn't
make sense, man.

01:28:37.805 --> 01:28:39.830
I'm just
a desk jockey...

01:28:39.941 --> 01:28:43.342
who was on my way
home when you rang.

01:28:43.444 --> 01:28:44.843
The way you drove,

01:28:44.946 --> 01:28:47.312
I figured you
for the street.

01:28:47.415 --> 01:28:50.077
In my youth.
In my youth.

01:28:55.456 --> 01:28:59.825
<i>What can we expect
in the next few hours?</i>

01:28:59.927 --> 01:29:01.656
The hostages
are probably experiencing...

01:29:01.762 --> 01:29:04.663
the early stages
of the Helsinki Syndrome.

01:29:04.765 --> 01:29:06.825
As in Helsinki,
Sweden.

01:29:06.935 --> 01:29:08.493
Finland.

01:29:08.604 --> 01:29:10.003
Basically, it's when
the hostages...

01:29:10.105 --> 01:29:11.504
and the terrorists...

01:29:11.607 --> 01:29:14.667
go through a sort of
psychological transference...

01:29:14.776 --> 01:29:17.108
and a projection
of dependency.

01:29:17.212 --> 01:29:19.840
<i>A strange sort of trust
and bond develops.</i>

01:29:19.948 --> 01:29:22.348
<i>We've had situations
where the hostages...</i>

01:29:22.451 --> 01:29:24.351
<i>embraced their captors
after release...</i>

01:29:24.453 --> 01:29:27.547
<i>and even corresponded
with them in prison.</i>

01:29:34.296 --> 01:29:35.194
Yeah?

01:29:35.297 --> 01:29:37.198
The FBI is here.

01:29:37.300 --> 01:29:39.131
The FBI is here now?

01:29:39.235 --> 01:29:41.362
Yes, sir.
Right over there.

01:29:41.471 --> 01:29:42.233
Hold this.

01:29:42.338 --> 01:29:44.636
Want a breath mint?

01:29:48.244 --> 01:29:50.644
Hey, how you
doing, man?

01:29:50.747 --> 01:29:52.146
I'm AgentJohnson.

01:29:52.248 --> 01:29:53.647
This is Special AgentJohnson.

01:29:53.750 --> 01:29:55.650
Oh, how you doing?

01:29:55.752 --> 01:29:57.310
No relation.

01:29:57.420 --> 01:29:58.648
I'm, uh...

01:29:58.755 --> 01:30:00.655
I'm Dwayne Robinson,
L.A.P.D.

01:30:00.757 --> 01:30:03.658
I'm in charge here.

01:30:03.760 --> 01:30:05.319
Not anymore.

01:31:00.285 --> 01:31:04.346
Hi there.
How you doing?

01:31:07.626 --> 01:31:09.526
Ooh...

01:31:09.628 --> 01:31:12.859
Please, God. You're
one of them, aren't you?

01:31:12.965 --> 01:31:15.024
You're one of them.

01:31:15.134 --> 01:31:18.194
No! Don't kill me!
No, please.

01:31:18.304 --> 01:31:21.034
Don't kill me,
please! No!

01:31:21.140 --> 01:31:23.574
Relax. I'm not
going to hurt you.

01:31:23.676 --> 01:31:25.143
I won't hurt you!

01:31:28.147 --> 01:31:30.047
Oh, God.

01:31:31.650 --> 01:31:34.483
What the fuck are
you doing up here?

01:31:34.587 --> 01:31:36.556
What were you
looking for?

01:31:36.656 --> 01:31:39.557
I managed to get
out of there.

01:31:39.659 --> 01:31:43.060
I was trying to get
up on the roof...

01:31:43.163 --> 01:31:46.064
and see if I could
signal for help.

01:31:46.166 --> 01:31:48.293
Why don't you
come and help?

01:31:48.401 --> 01:31:51.564
Hold it. Hold it.
Forget the roof.

01:31:51.671 --> 01:31:53.070
Forget the roof.

01:31:53.173 --> 01:31:55.573
They got people
all over it.

01:31:55.675 --> 01:31:58.803
You want to stay alive,
you stay with me.

01:32:01.715 --> 01:32:04.206
The best
we can figure it,

01:32:04.317 --> 01:32:07.219
we've got maybe 30 or 35
hostages up there,

01:32:07.321 --> 01:32:09.221
probably
on the 30th floor,

01:32:09.323 --> 01:32:13.089
and maybe seven or eight
terrorists up there.

01:32:13.194 --> 01:32:15.253
Sounds like
an A-7 scenario.

01:32:15.363 --> 01:32:17.092
We'll handle it
from here.

01:32:17.198 --> 01:32:18.597
When we
commandeer your men,

01:32:18.699 --> 01:32:20.132
we'll let you know.

01:32:20.234 --> 01:32:21.633
Aren't you...

01:32:21.736 --> 01:32:23.101
forgetting something?

01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:24.102
Such as?

01:32:24.205 --> 01:32:25.638
What about
John McClane?

01:32:25.740 --> 01:32:27.139
He's the reason...

01:32:27.241 --> 01:32:28.833
we have
any information.

01:32:28.943 --> 01:32:30.706
He's also the reason...

01:32:30.812 --> 01:32:32.541
you're only facing
seven terrorists.

01:32:32.647 --> 01:32:35.014
He's inside?
Who is he?

01:32:35.117 --> 01:32:38.018
He might be a cop.
We're checking.

01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.451
One of yours?

01:32:39.555 --> 01:32:40.613
No way.

01:32:45.494 --> 01:32:47.121
You smoke?

01:32:47.229 --> 01:32:50.062
Yeah.

01:32:54.670 --> 01:32:55.728
Thanks.

01:33:00.175 --> 01:33:02.837
You don't work
for Nakatomi.

01:33:05.682 --> 01:33:08.879
And if you're not
one of them-

01:33:11.054 --> 01:33:13.545
I'm a cop
from New York.

01:33:15.191 --> 01:33:17.091
New York?

01:33:17.193 --> 01:33:21.425
Yeah. Got invited to
the Christmas party by mistake.

01:33:21.531 --> 01:33:23.328
Who knew?

01:33:29.305 --> 01:33:33.401
<i>Well, it's better than being caught
with your pants down, huh?</i>

01:33:43.554 --> 01:33:44.816
I'm John McClane.

01:33:46.156 --> 01:33:49.057
<i>You're, uh...</i>

01:33:49.159 --> 01:33:50.217
Clay.

01:33:52.162 --> 01:33:53.857
Bill Clay.

01:33:59.169 --> 01:34:02.161
Know how to use
a handgun, Bill?

01:34:02.273 --> 01:34:05.243
I spent a weekend
at a combat ranch-

01:34:05.343 --> 01:34:07.971
The guns that shoot
red paint.

01:34:08.079 --> 01:34:12.072
Probably seems
kind of stupid to you.

01:34:12.183 --> 01:34:13.275
Nope.

01:34:15.186 --> 01:34:17.677
Time for the real
thing, Bill.

01:34:26.364 --> 01:34:29.800
All you got to do
is pull the trigger.

01:34:49.155 --> 01:34:51.055
Put down the gun...

01:34:51.157 --> 01:34:53.523
and give me
my detonators.

01:34:58.130 --> 01:35:00.997
Well, well, well...

01:35:01.100 --> 01:35:02.431
Hans.

01:35:02.535 --> 01:35:05.972
Put it down now.

01:35:09.609 --> 01:35:12.510
That's pretty tricky
with that accent.

01:35:12.612 --> 01:35:15.638
You ought to be
on fucking TV.

01:35:18.118 --> 01:35:22.384
What do you want
with the detonators, Hans?

01:35:22.489 --> 01:35:25.458
I already used
all the explosives...

01:35:26.994 --> 01:35:28.791
or did I?

01:35:28.895 --> 01:35:31.489
I'm going to
count to three.

01:35:31.598 --> 01:35:32.530
Yeah.

01:35:32.632 --> 01:35:34.260
Like you did
with Takagi?

01:35:35.370 --> 01:35:36.268
Oops.

01:35:38.172 --> 01:35:39.662
No bullets.

01:35:39.774 --> 01:35:42.607
- What do you think-
I'm fucking stupid, Hans?

01:35:42.710 --> 01:35:43.677
You we're saying?

01:36:37.967 --> 01:36:38.865
Karl.

01:36:47.877 --> 01:36:50.505
Shoot the glass!

01:37:23.647 --> 01:37:25.979
Jesus Christ!

01:37:54.513 --> 01:37:57.573
Smile, Karl.
We're back in business.

01:38:00.385 --> 01:38:02.684
<i>...is the last resort
of diplomacy,</i>

01:38:02.788 --> 01:38:05.018
<i>couldn't we
just as well say...</i>

01:38:05.124 --> 01:38:07.456
<i>that terrorism
has an equal claim...</i>

01:38:07.560 --> 01:38:09.494
<i>on being that, too?</i>

01:38:09.595 --> 01:38:12.359
You got something.
Tell me you got something.

01:38:12.465 --> 01:38:15.195
Just McClane's name,
badge number, employment record,

01:38:15.301 --> 01:38:17.895
vital statistics,
and his family's home address,

01:38:18.004 --> 01:38:20.404
right here in L.A.

01:38:20.506 --> 01:38:23.031
Woo!

01:38:28.281 --> 01:38:30.044
Go to work.

01:38:30.149 --> 01:38:31.548
You got it.

01:38:43.497 --> 01:38:45.397
God!
That man looks...

01:38:45.499 --> 01:38:47.057
really pissed.

01:38:48.669 --> 01:38:51.069
He's still alive.

01:38:51.171 --> 01:38:53.071
What?

01:38:53.173 --> 01:38:57.234
OnlyJohn can drive
somebody that crazy.

01:39:13.194 --> 01:39:15.788
Hans, you better
heat up that miracle.

01:39:15.897 --> 01:39:18.457
We broke through
on number six.

01:39:18.566 --> 01:39:21.228
The electromagnetic
came down like a fucking anvil.

01:39:21.336 --> 01:39:24.533
See what our friends
outside are doing,

01:39:24.639 --> 01:39:26.573
and I'll be right up.

01:39:28.076 --> 01:39:29.976
Hey,John.
John McClane,

01:39:30.078 --> 01:39:31.979
you still with us?

01:39:32.081 --> 01:39:33.480
Yeah.

01:39:33.582 --> 01:39:34.981
All things being equal,

01:39:35.084 --> 01:39:37.484
I'd rather be
in Philadelphia.

01:39:37.586 --> 01:39:40.419
Chalk up
two more bad guys.

01:39:40.522 --> 01:39:42.422
Well, the boys
down here...

01:39:42.524 --> 01:39:44.924
will be glad
to hear that.

01:39:45.027 --> 01:39:47.928
We got a pool
going on you.

01:39:48.030 --> 01:39:49.930
What kind of odds
am I getting?

01:39:50.032 --> 01:39:52.432
<i>- You don't want to know.
- Put me down for 20.</i>

01:39:52.534 --> 01:39:54.900
I'm good for it.

01:39:56.538 --> 01:39:59.871
<i>Hey, pal,you got flat feet?</i>

01:40:01.878 --> 01:40:04.972
What the hell are
you talking about?

01:40:05.081 --> 01:40:07.982
Something had to
get you off the street.

01:40:08.084 --> 01:40:09.984
You don't think
jockeying papers...

01:40:10.086 --> 01:40:12.020
is a noble effort?

01:40:13.823 --> 01:40:15.222
<i>No.</i>

01:40:18.328 --> 01:40:20.228
I had an accident.

01:40:20.330 --> 01:40:24.027
<i>The way you drive,
I can see why.</i>

01:40:24.134 --> 01:40:26.568
You run over
your captain's foot?

01:40:29.839 --> 01:40:31.774
I shot a kid.

01:40:31.876 --> 01:40:34.276
<i>He was 13 years old.</i>

01:40:34.378 --> 01:40:37.279
Oh, it was dark.
I couldn't see him.

01:40:37.381 --> 01:40:40.350
<i>Oh, it was dark. He had a ray
gun that looked real enough.</i>

01:40:43.854 --> 01:40:45.719
When you're a rookie,
they can teach you...

01:40:45.823 --> 01:40:47.222
everything
about being a cop,

01:40:47.325 --> 01:40:49.293
except how to live
with a mistake.

01:40:52.830 --> 01:40:55.230
<i>Anyway, I just
couldn't bring myself...</i>

01:40:55.333 --> 01:40:58.962
<i>to draw my gun
on anybody again.</i>

01:41:00.838 --> 01:41:02.739
<i>Sorry, man.</i>

01:41:02.841 --> 01:41:06.743
Hey, man,
how could you know?

01:41:08.847 --> 01:41:12.010
I feel like shit
anyway.

01:41:12.117 --> 01:41:15.644
Well, then,
this won't matter.

01:41:15.754 --> 01:41:17.779
<i>The L.A.P.D. is not...</i>

01:41:17.889 --> 01:41:20.323
<i>calling the shots
down here anymore.</i>

01:41:22.361 --> 01:41:24.056
The feds?

01:41:24.162 --> 01:41:25.561
You got it.

01:41:27.199 --> 01:41:31.261
All right.
Those are the city engineers.

01:41:31.371 --> 01:41:34.272
They're going into
the street circuits.

01:41:34.374 --> 01:41:36.774
<i>Those guys in the suits,
I don't know who they are.</i>

01:41:36.876 --> 01:41:38.343
<i>That's the FBI.</i>

01:41:38.444 --> 01:41:40.275
They're ordering
the others...

01:41:40.380 --> 01:41:42.280
to cut
the building's power.

01:41:42.382 --> 01:41:44.850
Regular
as clockwork.

01:41:46.386 --> 01:41:48.286
Or a time lock.

01:41:48.388 --> 01:41:50.652
<i>Precisely.</i>

01:41:50.757 --> 01:41:53.123
The circuits
that cannot be cut...

01:41:53.226 --> 01:41:54.625
are cut automatically...

01:41:54.727 --> 01:41:57.127
in response to
a terrorist incident.

01:41:57.230 --> 01:41:59.130
You asked for miracles.

01:41:59.232 --> 01:42:02.259
I give you the FBI.

01:43:23.957 --> 01:43:25.015
It's going to go!

01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:28.218
Yes!

01:43:50.785 --> 01:43:52.184
Merry Christmas.

01:43:54.088 --> 01:43:56.852
Those bastards are probably
pissing in their pants.

01:43:56.957 --> 01:43:59.118
The mayor will
have my ass.

01:44:05.801 --> 01:44:07.200
Woo!

01:44:20.582 --> 01:44:22.777
What will we do now?

01:44:22.884 --> 01:44:25.717
Arrest them for not paying
their electric bill?

01:44:25.821 --> 01:44:27.721
We've shut them down.

01:44:27.823 --> 01:44:29.222
We let them sweat,

01:44:29.324 --> 01:44:31.259
then give them
helicopters.

01:44:31.361 --> 01:44:33.226
Right up the ass.

01:44:35.331 --> 01:44:39.165
This is AgentJohnson.
No, the other one.

01:44:39.268 --> 01:44:42.169
I want air support
ready in five minutes.

01:44:42.271 --> 01:44:44.034
Damn right.
Fully armed.

01:44:44.140 --> 01:44:46.005
<i>We're on the way.</i>

01:44:52.782 --> 01:44:53.874
Yeah!

01:44:53.983 --> 01:44:57.885
I wish to talk to the FBI.

01:45:00.290 --> 01:45:02.758
This is
Special AgentJohnson.

01:45:02.860 --> 01:45:04.760
The State Department
has arranged...

01:45:04.862 --> 01:45:07.296
for the return
of your comrades.

01:45:07.398 --> 01:45:10.196
Helicopters are en route
as you requested.

01:45:10.300 --> 01:45:11.699
We'll be ready.

01:45:11.802 --> 01:45:13.201
When he realizes
what hit him,

01:45:13.303 --> 01:45:14.827
he'll be dead.

01:45:14.938 --> 01:45:17.839
When they touch down,
we'll blow the roof.

01:45:17.941 --> 01:45:19.841
By the time
they figure out...

01:45:19.943 --> 01:45:21.342
what went wrong,

01:45:21.445 --> 01:45:23.379
we'll be sitting
on a beach...

01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:24.742
earning 20%.

01:45:29.320 --> 01:45:31.220
Ah!Jeez!

01:45:31.322 --> 01:45:34.951
Powell?
Yo, Powell, you got a minute?

01:45:36.661 --> 01:45:38.390
I'm here,John.

01:45:40.098 --> 01:45:43.499
I'm starting to get
a bad feeling up here.

01:45:43.601 --> 01:45:46.502
I want you to do
something for me.

01:45:46.604 --> 01:45:48.162
Um...

01:45:48.273 --> 01:45:51.174
I want you
to find my wife.

01:45:51.276 --> 01:45:53.176
Don't ask me how.

01:45:53.278 --> 01:45:56.179
I want you
to tell her something.

01:45:56.281 --> 01:45:59.183
I want you
to tell her that...

01:45:59.285 --> 01:46:00.684
Um...

01:46:02.288 --> 01:46:03.687
Mmm...

01:46:05.791 --> 01:46:09.693
Tell her it took me
a while to figure out...

01:46:09.795 --> 01:46:11.695
what a jerk I'd been,

01:46:11.797 --> 01:46:15.198
but, um... that...

01:46:19.305 --> 01:46:22.706
that when things started
to pan out for her,

01:46:22.808 --> 01:46:25.709
I should have been
more supportive,

01:46:25.811 --> 01:46:27.676
and, uh...

01:46:27.780 --> 01:46:30.875
I just should have
been behind her more.

01:46:33.820 --> 01:46:35.720
Oh, shit.

01:46:38.325 --> 01:46:41.158
Tell her that, um...

01:46:41.261 --> 01:46:44.162
that she's the best thing
that ever happened...

01:46:44.264 --> 01:46:46.164
to a bum like me.

01:46:47.767 --> 01:46:50.668
She's heard me say
"I love you"

01:46:50.770 --> 01:46:52.169
a thousand times.

01:46:52.272 --> 01:46:55.173
She never heard me
say "I'm sorry. "

01:46:56.776 --> 01:46:59.678
I want you to
tell her that, Al.

01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:02.180
I want you
to tell her...

01:47:02.283 --> 01:47:05.184
thatJohn said
that he was sorry.

01:47:05.286 --> 01:47:07.686
Okay?
You got that, man?

01:47:07.788 --> 01:47:10.120
Yeah, I got it,John,

01:47:10.224 --> 01:47:13.193
but you can
tell her that yourself.

01:47:13.294 --> 01:47:16.195
Just watch your ass
and make it out.

01:47:16.297 --> 01:47:17.696
You hear me?

01:47:17.798 --> 01:47:20.790
I guess that's up to
the man upstairs.

01:47:24.305 --> 01:47:28.207
John? John?

01:47:28.309 --> 01:47:29.709
What the fuck...

01:47:29.811 --> 01:47:31.210
were you doing
upstairs, Hans?

01:47:33.315 --> 01:47:34.714
John?

01:47:34.816 --> 01:47:36.215
Al, listen.

01:47:36.318 --> 01:47:37.945
Just lay off
for a while.

01:47:38.053 --> 01:47:41.318
<i>I got to go
check on something.</i>

01:47:45.394 --> 01:47:48.158
One minute,
that's all I'm asking-

01:47:48.263 --> 01:47:50.788
One minute
to speak to them.

01:47:50.899 --> 01:47:53.163
All right.
Get back. Get back.

01:47:53.268 --> 01:47:55.168
All right,
look, look, look.

01:47:55.270 --> 01:48:01.335
<i>- Let me in right now,
or I call the I.N.S. ¿Comprende?</i>

01:48:01.444 --> 01:48:02.672
This is the last time
these kids will have...

01:48:02.779 --> 01:48:04.679
to speak
to their parents.

01:48:06.783 --> 01:48:08.182
- All right?
- Mm.

01:48:08.284 --> 01:48:10.946
All right.
Come on.

01:48:20.463 --> 01:48:22.829
What were you
doing, Hans?

01:48:22.932 --> 01:48:25.298
What were you doing?

01:48:46.857 --> 01:48:49.917
Jesus, Mary,
Mother of God.

01:48:54.131 --> 01:48:55.758
It's a double-cross!

01:48:55.866 --> 01:48:57.766
The roof is wired to-

01:49:00.872 --> 01:49:01.770
John?

01:49:04.376 --> 01:49:05.274
John!

01:49:06.511 --> 01:49:08.274
John, come in!

01:49:08.380 --> 01:49:10.280
Did you get that?

01:49:10.382 --> 01:49:12.282
Something about
a double-cross.

01:49:12.384 --> 01:49:14.784
Tell me about it.

01:49:20.392 --> 01:49:22.292
We are both
professionals.

01:49:24.396 --> 01:49:26.296
This is personal.

01:49:27.900 --> 01:49:29.299
Ah...

01:49:30.603 --> 01:49:32.662
Aagh!

01:49:43.716 --> 01:49:45.547
Aah!

01:49:50.222 --> 01:49:52.256
They're coming!

01:49:52.358 --> 01:49:54.258
The choppers
are coming.

01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:55.759
Okay,

01:49:55.861 --> 01:49:58.763
Time to gather your flock,
Miss Gennero.

01:49:58.865 --> 01:50:02.665
<i>Your mom and dad
are very important people.</i>

01:50:02.769 --> 01:50:05.067
<i>They're very brave people.</i>

01:50:05.172 --> 01:50:08.505
<i>Is there something
you'd like to say to them?</i>

01:50:08.608 --> 01:50:12.044
Come home.

01:50:18.985 --> 01:50:21.783
Mrs. McClane.

01:50:23.890 --> 01:50:29.022
How nice to make
your acquaintance.

01:50:31.966 --> 01:50:33.866
Everyone
to the roof!

01:50:33.968 --> 01:50:36.198
Lock them there.
Come right back.

01:50:43.411 --> 01:50:44.309
Ah!

01:51:03.398 --> 01:51:06.390
You should have heard
your brother squeal...

01:51:06.502 --> 01:51:09.562
when I broke
his fucking neck!

01:51:12.975 --> 01:51:15.341
What do you
figure the breakage?

01:51:15.444 --> 01:51:17.344
We take out
the terrorists,

01:51:17.446 --> 01:51:20.677
lose 20, 25%
of the hostages... tops.

01:51:20.783 --> 01:51:22.683
I can live
with that.

01:51:22.785 --> 01:51:25.276
Get this thing
on the deck.

01:51:25.387 --> 01:51:28.687
They're expecting
transports, not gun ships.

01:51:40.737 --> 01:51:42.364
Move it!

01:51:42.472 --> 01:51:44.337
Come on! Move!

01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:46.374
Move it!

01:51:46.476 --> 01:51:48.376
Go! Move!

01:51:51.481 --> 01:51:52.880
Theo.

01:51:52.982 --> 01:51:54.882
A little bonus for us.

01:51:54.984 --> 01:51:56.383
Please, sit down.

01:51:56.486 --> 01:51:57.886
Sit down!

01:51:57.988 --> 01:52:00.889
A policeman's wife
might come in handy.

01:52:00.991 --> 01:52:03.892
McClane, I have
some news for you.

01:52:03.994 --> 01:52:06.019
McClane.

01:52:06.130 --> 01:52:07.062
Ah!

01:52:12.837 --> 01:52:14.532
Aah!

01:52:16.407 --> 01:52:17.897
Come on! Move!

01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:20.909
Come on!

01:52:29.855 --> 01:52:31.652
Yaah!

01:52:33.525 --> 01:52:36.085
Motherfucker!
I'll kill you!

01:52:39.464 --> 01:52:40.863
Armed.

01:52:40.966 --> 01:52:42.365
The truck?

01:52:42.467 --> 01:52:43.866
The truck.

01:52:50.242 --> 01:52:51.869
After all
your posturing,

01:52:51.977 --> 01:52:53.877
all your little
speeches,

01:52:53.979 --> 01:52:57.541
you're nothing
but a common thief.

01:52:57.650 --> 01:52:59.880
I am an exceptional thief,
Mrs. McClane,

01:52:59.986 --> 01:53:01.817
and since I'm moving
up to kidnapping,

01:53:01.921 --> 01:53:03.889
you should be
more polite.

01:53:05.424 --> 01:53:06.482
Yaah!

01:53:09.495 --> 01:53:10.985
Oh!

01:53:11.097 --> 01:53:13.190
Going to kill you!

01:53:13.299 --> 01:53:15.199
I'm going to
fucking cook you!

01:53:15.301 --> 01:53:16.529
Going to fucking
eat you!

01:53:39.226 --> 01:53:41.217
I don't
like this, Sarge.

01:53:49.336 --> 01:53:51.736
Yaa-hah!

01:53:51.838 --> 01:53:53.738
Just like
fucking Saigon,

01:53:53.840 --> 01:53:55.398
Hey, slick?

01:53:55.509 --> 01:53:59.241
I was in junior high,
dickhead.

01:54:27.543 --> 01:54:28.942
Where's Holly?

01:54:29.044 --> 01:54:30.443
Where's Holly Gennero?

01:54:30.546 --> 01:54:32.446
Holly Gennero?
Where's Holly?

01:54:32.548 --> 01:54:34.448
Where's Holly?
Where is she?

01:54:34.550 --> 01:54:35.949
They took her!
Where?

01:54:36.051 --> 01:54:37.450
The vault! Where is the vault?

01:54:37.553 --> 01:54:39.384
The 30th floor!

01:54:39.488 --> 01:54:40.887
They took her!

01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:42.617
Get downstairs!

01:54:42.725 --> 01:54:46.889
The whole fucking roof
is wired to blow!

01:54:46.996 --> 01:54:50.159
Get down!
Get the fuck downstairs!

01:54:51.834 --> 01:54:53.734
They made us, Bureau. You got a
terrorist shooting at hostages.

01:54:53.836 --> 01:54:55.133
Break left!

01:55:02.746 --> 01:55:04.236
Nail that sucker!

01:55:12.555 --> 01:55:15.490
I'm on your side,
you assholes!

01:55:15.592 --> 01:55:17.025
Swing around again!

01:55:17.127 --> 01:55:18.617
I'll bag
this little bastard.

01:55:37.581 --> 01:55:39.412
What the fuck...

01:55:41.519 --> 01:55:44.420
Oh,John, what the fuck
are you doing?

01:55:44.522 --> 01:55:47.923
How the fuck did you
get into this shit?

01:55:49.460 --> 01:55:52.793
Aah! Aah!

01:55:52.897 --> 01:55:55.058
Aah!

01:55:55.167 --> 01:55:57.235
Aah!

01:55:57.335 --> 01:56:00.736
There's something wrong!
They're coming back down!

01:56:00.839 --> 01:56:01.863
Blow the roof.

01:56:01.973 --> 01:56:03.201
Karl's up there!

01:56:03.308 --> 01:56:04.297
Blow the roof!

01:56:07.779 --> 01:56:10.680
I promise
I will never even think...

01:56:10.782 --> 01:56:13.546
about going up
in a tall building again.

01:56:15.821 --> 01:56:18.790
Oh, God,
please don't let me die!

01:56:32.805 --> 01:56:34.295
Yaah!

01:57:03.170 --> 01:57:05.104
Oh!

01:57:24.124 --> 01:57:25.183
Aah!

01:57:25.293 --> 01:57:26.487
Aah!

01:57:50.952 --> 01:57:52.852
Holy Christ!

01:57:53.955 --> 01:57:54.980
We're
going to need...

01:57:55.090 --> 01:57:57.217
some more
FBI guys, I guess.

01:57:57.326 --> 01:57:59.157
Aah! Aah!

01:58:10.039 --> 01:58:12.166
Jesus fucking Christ!

01:58:12.274 --> 01:58:13.673
Fuck!

01:58:38.335 --> 01:58:40.735
What the fuck
is going on?

01:58:42.038 --> 01:58:43.630
What are you going to do?

01:58:43.740 --> 01:58:45.298
Sit here while
the building falls?

01:58:53.817 --> 01:58:55.547
Shit!

01:58:55.653 --> 01:58:57.143
Oh! All right!

01:58:57.255 --> 01:58:58.654
Uli.

01:58:58.756 --> 01:59:00.121
Hey!
Hey!

01:59:00.224 --> 01:59:02.158
Hang on, baby.

01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:04.660
Hang on, honey.

01:59:04.762 --> 01:59:06.525
Oh, God.

01:59:39.231 --> 01:59:40.459
Oh!

01:59:44.603 --> 01:59:45.467
<i>Allez! Allez vite!</i>

01:59:45.570 --> 01:59:47.902
<i>J'y vais!
J'y vais!</i>

01:59:51.810 --> 01:59:53.334
Hans!

02:00:07.493 --> 02:00:09.723
Jesus.

02:00:09.829 --> 02:00:11.660
Hi, honey.

02:00:33.220 --> 02:00:36.314
So that's what this
is all about?

02:00:36.423 --> 02:00:37.822
A fucking robbery?

02:00:37.925 --> 02:00:39.756
Put down the gun.

02:00:39.860 --> 02:00:43.796
Why'd you have to nuke
the whole building, Hans?

02:00:43.897 --> 02:00:45.797
Well, when
you steal $600,

02:00:45.899 --> 02:00:46.923
you can disappear.

02:00:47.034 --> 02:00:48.934
When you steal
600 million,

02:00:49.036 --> 02:00:50.003
they'll find you...

02:00:50.104 --> 02:00:52.504
unless they think
you're already dead.

02:00:52.606 --> 02:00:54.472
Put down the gun.

02:01:01.416 --> 02:01:03.475
Uh.

02:01:05.120 --> 02:01:06.610
<i>Nein. This is mine.</i>

02:01:08.723 --> 02:01:10.657
You got me.

02:01:10.759 --> 02:01:14.718
<i>Still the cowboy,
Mr. McClane.</i>

02:01:14.829 --> 02:01:16.228
Americans, all alike.

02:01:16.331 --> 02:01:18.959
This time,John Wayne doesn't
walk off into the sunset...

02:01:19.067 --> 02:01:20.500
with Grace Kelly.

02:01:20.602 --> 02:01:22.433
That was Gary Cooper,
asshole.

02:01:22.537 --> 02:01:24.301
Enough jokes.

02:01:24.407 --> 02:01:25.806
You'd have made...

02:01:25.908 --> 02:01:27.273
a good cowboy
yourself, Hans.

02:01:27.376 --> 02:01:28.775
Oh, yeah.

02:01:28.878 --> 02:01:32.006
What was it you said
to me before?

02:01:32.114 --> 02:01:35.606
Yippee-kai-yay,
motherfucker.

02:01:56.673 --> 02:01:57.935
Holly!

02:02:02.746 --> 02:02:04.941
Happy trails, Hans.

02:02:10.153 --> 02:02:11.120
Aah!

02:02:11.221 --> 02:02:12.119
Holly.

02:02:14.191 --> 02:02:16.318
Aah!

02:02:49.494 --> 02:02:51.553
I hope that's
not a hostage.

02:03:19.892 --> 02:03:23.385
<i>Water hook-up
companies 93, 96-</i>

02:03:23.496 --> 02:03:25.157
<i>Must have burned down
the whole building.</i>

02:03:27.267 --> 02:03:29.667
Over here.
It's a better angle.

02:03:29.769 --> 02:03:31.600
Let's give them...

02:03:33.706 --> 02:03:36.607
Keep it going, now.
Keep it going.

02:03:42.215 --> 02:03:44.615
Come on.
We're going to miss it!

02:03:44.717 --> 02:03:46.617
Okay.
Hand me my notes!

02:04:06.507 --> 02:04:07.906
Come on, folks.

02:04:08.008 --> 02:04:10.408
What was it like
in there?

02:04:10.511 --> 02:04:12.775
How did they
treat you?

02:04:58.361 --> 02:05:00.761
Al, this is
my wife Holly.

02:05:00.863 --> 02:05:02.262
Holly Gennero.

02:05:02.365 --> 02:05:03.764
Holly McClane.

02:05:03.866 --> 02:05:05.629
Hello, Holly.

02:05:05.735 --> 02:05:08.135
You got yourself
a good man.

02:05:08.237 --> 02:05:10.603
You take
good care of him.

02:05:11.874 --> 02:05:13.364
<i>McClane!</i>

02:05:13.476 --> 02:05:15.376
McClane,
I want a debriefing!

02:05:15.478 --> 02:05:16.877
You got some things...

02:05:16.979 --> 02:05:18.378
to answer for,
mister-

02:05:18.481 --> 02:05:20.745
Ellis' murder,
for one thing,

02:05:20.850 --> 02:05:22.113
<i>property damage,</i>

02:05:22.219 --> 02:05:24.619
<i>interfering with
police business.</i>

02:06:03.661 --> 02:06:06.596
<i>All right!
Two of you go inside...</i>

02:06:06.698 --> 02:06:09.098
<i>- and see if there's
anybody else! - Yes, sir-</i>

02:06:19.377 --> 02:06:21.278
This one's with me.

02:06:31.390 --> 02:06:32.789
Mr. McClane.
Mr. McClane!

02:06:32.891 --> 02:06:35.587
After this
incredible ordeal,

02:06:35.694 --> 02:06:37.719
what are
your feelings?

02:06:41.700 --> 02:06:44.726
Well, well, well.

02:06:44.837 --> 02:06:46.737
Merry Christmas,
Argyle.

02:06:46.839 --> 02:06:48.067
Merry Christmas.

02:06:51.010 --> 02:06:53.240
Did you get that?

02:06:53.346 --> 02:06:54.745
Let me through.

02:06:54.848 --> 02:06:57.749
If this is their idea
of Christmas,

02:06:57.851 --> 02:07:00.752
I got to be here
for New Year's.

02:07:04.758 --> 02:07:08.216
<i># Oh, the weather outside

02:07:08.328 --> 02:07:12.094

<i># And since we've
no place to go #</i>

02:07:16.136 --> 02:07:20.102
<i># Let it snow, let it snow,
let it snow #</i>

02:07:20.206 --> 02:07:23.574
<i># It doesn't show signs
of stopping #</i>

02:07:23.677 --> 02:07:27.272
<i># And I brought
some corn for popping #</i>

02:07:27.381 --> 02:07:31.010
<i># The lights are turned
way down low #</i>

02:07:31.118 --> 02:07:34.713

<i># All the way home,
I'll be warm #</i>

02:07:50.405 --> 02:07:53.238
