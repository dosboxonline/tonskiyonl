WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.477
The following programme contains
strong language and violent scenes.

00:15.957 --> 00:18.796
You're going to Tallinn.
UDC's going to be there.

00:18.797 --> 00:21.076
I'm announcing River in four days

00:21.077 --> 00:23.996
and it will be released on the 28th.

00:23.997 --> 00:26.756
'Where is he now?'
He should be in Tallinn.

00:26.757 --> 00:28.396
You need to find him
and stay with him.

00:28.397 --> 00:31.876
Distance to the target is 75m.

00:31.877 --> 00:34.356
What are the obstacles?
A...metal detector

00:34.357 --> 00:36.396
and
an ultra-sensitive scanner

00:36.397 --> 00:38.676
but I've got an idea for that.
That's very clever.

00:38.677 --> 00:40.476
The glass is bullet-resistant.

00:40.477 --> 00:44.156
It'll stop five rounds
from a 7.62mm rifle.

00:44.157 --> 00:46.797
That is a fucking work of art.

00:49.037 --> 00:50.396
Can you call them please?

00:50.397 --> 00:52.076
I do not want her here.
Angela, go inside.

00:52.077 --> 00:54.596
I'm talking to my husband and child!
Please go back inside.

00:54.597 --> 00:56.956
You have good man face.

00:56.957 --> 00:59.476
'Why do you need this disguise?'

00:59.477 --> 01:01.597
'There are people looking for me.'

01:06.317 --> 01:08.116
Could I see some ID, please?

01:08.117 --> 01:09.556
Hi, is that Rasmus?

01:09.557 --> 01:11.676
I just wondered
if you wanted to grab a drink?

01:11.677 --> 01:13.276
What sort of vibe
would you say I have?

01:13.277 --> 01:16.877
Kinda serious. Also a bit dangerous.

01:18.957 --> 01:21.196
# Some flowers

02:43.917 --> 02:46.196
So, two British Intelligence officers

02:46.197 --> 02:48.357
arrived here last night
from Budapest.

02:52.797 --> 02:56.236
Male, mid-30s, white,

02:56.237 --> 02:58.436
about 5'10", brown hair.

02:58.437 --> 03:00.276
Female about the same age,

03:00.277 --> 03:02.797
Black, first name: Bianca.

03:04.357 --> 03:07.476
I was wondering if your people might
be able to do something about them.

03:07.477 --> 03:09.757
Wait, are you asking me for my help?

03:13.197 --> 03:14.637
Sure.

03:15.717 --> 03:18.317
On it. Rodin's arriving on Friday.

03:20.077 --> 03:22.836
They're gonna ask me
if you're confident it can be done.

03:22.837 --> 03:25.876
Well, you can tell them
whatever they wanna hear.

03:25.877 --> 03:28.276
Well, I'm also asking for myself.

03:28.277 --> 03:31.077
So, what would you like me
to tell you?

03:32.357 --> 03:33.957
That you'll deliver.

03:40.197 --> 03:41.797
I'm on your side.

03:42.917 --> 03:45.596
I was hoping
that would be clear by now.

03:45.597 --> 03:47.996
I was hoping this could be
even more of a collaboration.

03:47.997 --> 03:49.237
I don't collaborate.

03:50.917 --> 03:52.796
You won't hear from me
until after it's done

03:52.797 --> 03:55.557
and I expect to be paid promptly.

03:59.717 --> 04:01.236
It's me.

04:01.237 --> 04:03.877
Yeah, I need some
priority assistance on site.

04:05.397 --> 04:08.197
Sure, I'll have the details
sent to you right away.

04:09.237 --> 04:12.957
We've set you up
in the Cultural Attache's office.

04:15.677 --> 04:18.876
Good morning.
Welcome to Operation Anubis.

04:18.877 --> 04:20.516
Someone's pulled their finger out.

04:20.517 --> 04:23.076
The Foreign Secretary isn't
a particularly generous man.

04:23.077 --> 04:25.716
But he's personally
very miffed about the Jackal

04:25.717 --> 04:27.836
killing his friend, Manfred.

04:27.837 --> 04:30.516
Did we get any matches
from his DNA and prints?

04:30.517 --> 04:32.076
Nothing.

04:32.077 --> 04:33.876
This guy's a fucking ghost.

04:33.877 --> 04:37.716
Oskar Ilves of the Estonian Internal
Security Service is our liaison.

04:37.717 --> 04:40.356
His team is going
through hotels, hostels,

04:40.357 --> 04:42.476
Airbnb's and private rentals.

04:42.477 --> 04:44.636
They're also asking for a likeness,

04:44.637 --> 04:47.596
so I want you to meet Cole.

04:47.597 --> 04:51.277
Cole is going to help you
put a face to the Jackal.

04:53.277 --> 04:54.876
Wider...

04:54.877 --> 04:57.276
It's a bit more, yeah...
just like that. Yep. Like that.

04:57.277 --> 05:00.316
Don't do anything else-
Right, OK, yeah. What do you think?

05:00.317 --> 05:02.276
Vince. You saw him, right?

05:02.277 --> 05:05.037
Oh. For a split second.
Well, what do you think?

05:06.117 --> 05:08.676
Uh... Yeah, yeah. Could be him.

05:08.677 --> 05:10.916
Look, Osi, this is the best
it's gonna get it.

05:10.917 --> 05:12.876
OK.

05:12.877 --> 05:15.396
We'll share it with Oskar Ilves
and the Estonians.

05:15.397 --> 05:17.437
Thank you, Cole.

05:43.077 --> 05:46.556
Sir, I've just heard
a British team tracked

05:46.557 --> 05:48.596
the assassin to Hungary.

05:48.597 --> 05:52.276
Unfortunately, he got away.
He's resourceful and dangerous.

05:52.277 --> 05:55.276
You cannot go to Tallinn.
Do the launch from here.

05:55.277 --> 05:57.156
If I hide away...

05:57.157 --> 05:58.916
River's enemies win.

05:58.917 --> 06:01.716
We've been planning this for a year.

06:01.717 --> 06:04.356
The guests have been invited,
1,000 of them.

06:04.357 --> 06:06.676
Ordinary people,
all randomly selected.

06:06.677 --> 06:09.116
They have no idea where
they're going until they get there,

06:09.117 --> 06:11.997
and they've all signed NDAs.
People talk.

06:13.677 --> 06:16.756
If we cancel now,
UDC looks ridiculous.

06:16.757 --> 06:19.037
Better ridiculous than dead.

06:20.037 --> 06:21.677
Debatable.

06:31.117 --> 06:34.596
Morning. There you are.

06:34.597 --> 06:38.196
Sorry, I had something early
and I didn't wanna wake you.

06:38.197 --> 06:40.276
What's that?
Oh.

06:40.277 --> 06:44.156
I managed to get my hands on
these plans for the Konsterdisaal.

06:44.157 --> 06:47.196
It's pretty astonishing
what these guys managed to achieved.

06:47.197 --> 06:51.197
Yeah, I thought
last night was pretty great too.

06:54.557 --> 06:56.597
You've got a very nice smile, Rasmus.

06:57.677 --> 07:01.716
Thank you.
No, you sort of radiate kindness.

07:01.717 --> 07:04.036
Wow.
No, that's a good thing.

07:04.037 --> 07:07.557
You can't have
too much kindness these days. Hm.

07:11.477 --> 07:14.516
Uh... if you're trying to compete,
I should let you know

07:14.517 --> 07:17.196
that nothing turns me on
like a blueprint, so... Hm?

07:17.197 --> 07:19.476
Show me the hot bits.

07:19.477 --> 07:21.036
You wanna know?
Yeah.

07:21.037 --> 07:22.596
Yeah?
Yeah.

07:22.597 --> 07:23.957
So that bit there...

08:06.077 --> 08:08.077
Nuri...

08:11.677 --> 08:13.716
And how could you tell?

08:13.717 --> 08:16.076
U...Probably by getting up there
and having a look.

08:16.077 --> 08:18.556
But this isn't even trying
to explain it, so...

08:18.557 --> 08:20.277
Well, I could take you.

08:21.237 --> 08:22.796
Have a look.

08:22.797 --> 08:24.596
Really?
Mm.

08:24.597 --> 08:27.236
It would have to be
this afternoon, though.

08:27.237 --> 08:30.476
There's a concert tonight and
they'll shut the whole place down.

08:30.477 --> 08:33.276
Like, total lockdown.
What's that about?

08:33.277 --> 08:36.116
I dunno, they just told us
that after tonight

08:36.117 --> 08:38.757
no-one's getting in or out
without special permission.

08:41.197 --> 08:43.956
Well, they've got me leaving
this evening now, so,

08:43.957 --> 08:46.037
I could do this afternoon,
if that works?

08:49.157 --> 08:50.997
Would you make it worth my while?

09:10.917 --> 09:12.436
Buah...

09:12.437 --> 09:14.477
Pfft...

10:34.837 --> 10:36.517
Everything OK?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.637
Yeah.

10:41.557 --> 10:43.557
We're all good.
Hm.

11:21.957 --> 11:24.476
Hey, Rasmus!

11:24.477 --> 11:26.236
Fuck, I'm glad I'm not
working tonight.

11:26.237 --> 11:29.156
Imagine having to sit through
three hours of classical piano.

11:29.157 --> 11:32.357
Imagine.

11:34.317 --> 11:37.676
So, um... I'll just wait for you.

11:37.677 --> 11:40.676
Use this to get back in here.
Knock yourself out.

13:01.077 --> 13:02.837
Rasmus?

13:04.117 --> 13:07.076
Hey, how was that?
You have no idea what that was.

13:07.077 --> 13:10.316
That was, uh...
that was pretty extraordinary.

13:10.317 --> 13:13.036
What?

13:13.037 --> 13:16.436
No, you're just so happy about it.
It's hilarious.

13:16.437 --> 13:18.716
That, for me, that was...
that was a big thing.

13:18.717 --> 13:20.116
Right.

13:20.117 --> 13:21.436
Thank you.

13:21.437 --> 13:22.836
No problem.

13:22.837 --> 13:24.836
Do you wanna grab some food?

13:24.837 --> 13:27.196
I'd love that, but I've got
a ton of things I've gotta do

13:27.197 --> 13:28.716
before I fly, so...

13:28.717 --> 13:30.916
But I'll see you when
I come and pick up my stuff?

13:30.917 --> 13:32.276
Sure.
Yeah?

13:32.277 --> 13:34.116
Yeah.
Yeah?

13:34.117 --> 13:35.557
Yeah.
Yeah.

13:39.997 --> 13:41.756
I've established
a line of communication

13:41.757 --> 13:44.556
with Keith Canvey,
UDC's head of security.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.156
I've sent him the facial composite.

13:46.157 --> 13:48.556
But basically
he won't share anything with us.

13:48.557 --> 13:51.197
He's not even admitting
UDC's coming to Tallinn.

13:52.277 --> 13:55.516
I have Oskar Ilves for you, Osi.
Put him on speaker.

13:55.517 --> 13:57.436
Oskar, hi. It's Osi.

13:57.437 --> 14:00.676
'Hi. We have a police officer
who recognises the facial composite.

14:00.677 --> 14:03.756
She talked to the guy
last night at an Airbnb.

14:03.757 --> 14:06.796
British. Name of Peter Gibson.
I'm on my way to the location now.'

14:06.797 --> 14:08.436
Oskar, I'm sending you
one of our teams.

14:08.437 --> 14:10.436
Siobhan, get them transports
and an armed escort.

14:10.437 --> 14:12.316
Your escort is Richard and Phil.

14:12.317 --> 14:15.277
They'll meet you at the front
of the building in five.

14:30.877 --> 14:32.916
I've got the Airbnb location.

14:32.917 --> 14:33.996
No! Down, down!

14:49.237 --> 14:50.517
On me! Now!

15:00.357 --> 15:02.996
He aimed straight at you.
That was a fucking hit.

15:02.997 --> 15:04.636
Are you OK?
Yeah.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.517
Do you need to come inside?

15:07.357 --> 15:09.796
N-No. No, uh... we need to go.

15:09.797 --> 15:11.636
We need to go.
Go. I'll deal with the police.

15:11.637 --> 15:13.476
Hey. Hey, hey.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.517
Be careful.

15:28.277 --> 15:29.517
You OK?

15:31.677 --> 15:33.116
He didn't miss by much.

15:33.117 --> 15:35.237
Yeah... Idiot.

15:43.237 --> 15:45.116
Oskar Ilves, Internal Security.

15:45.117 --> 15:46.796
Do you know if our guy's in there?
We don't,

15:46.797 --> 15:48.796
but he was definitely there
last night.

15:48.797 --> 15:50.836
We've covered all the exits.
OK.

16:02.677 --> 16:04.677
Internal Security. Open the door.

16:07.837 --> 16:09.156
Go!

16:09.157 --> 16:11.957
Go, go, go, go!

16:14.117 --> 16:16.077
Clear!
Oh, shit.

16:28.161 --> 16:31.560
You OK?
Uh... Yeah, I had some dodgy sushi.

16:31.561 --> 16:34.040
I'm hoping these'll
bung me up before the flight.

16:34.041 --> 16:36.201
Too much information.

16:40.641 --> 16:42.641
Right...

16:48.161 --> 16:49.961
It's been fun.

16:51.441 --> 16:52.881
It's been more than fun.

16:56.921 --> 16:58.681
You got a good-man face, Rasmus.

17:00.121 --> 17:02.001
What does that mean?

17:04.081 --> 17:06.521
Kindness just seems
to come off you naturally.

17:09.121 --> 17:11.561
Guess I'm just a happy person.

17:27.201 --> 17:30.120
'Both UDC and DagHaus
have remained tight-lipped

17:30.121 --> 17:32.880
with regards to the upcoming
announcement of River.

17:32.881 --> 17:35.720
The venues in Dublin,
Dubai and Kuala Lumpur

17:35.721 --> 17:38.440
have all been rumoured
as possible locations.

17:38.441 --> 17:40.840
UDC has created quite a stir already

17:40.841 --> 17:44.041
with hints to what his latest
invention, River, can do.'

17:45.521 --> 17:48.440
UDC,
bless his pointy little head,

17:48.441 --> 17:51.040
hasn't got the memo
that class hatred...

17:51.041 --> 17:52.800
...makes no more sense now,

17:52.801 --> 17:56.561
just when the world needs to
pull together, than it ever did.

17:57.521 --> 17:59.880
It didn't happen. In Tallinn.

17:59.881 --> 18:02.280
It was a couple of Russians.
They botched it.

18:02.281 --> 18:05.920
Years after Communism,
Russians are still drunk,

18:05.921 --> 18:08.120
lazy, inept, corrupt peasants.

18:08.121 --> 18:11.720
National characteristics
always outlive regime change.

18:11.721 --> 18:13.280
It was very short notice, Tim.

18:13.281 --> 18:16.400
Do you know, when the Romans
could no longer find enough Romans

18:16.401 --> 18:20.400
to run their empire, Greatest empire
the world has ever known,

18:20.401 --> 18:22.240
they started hiring foreigners.

18:22.241 --> 18:26.200
The rest is history.
Decline and fall.

18:26.201 --> 18:28.520
Do you understand what I'm saying?

18:28.521 --> 18:30.240
No foreigners.

18:30.241 --> 18:31.801
Mmm.

18:33.121 --> 18:37.520
You tell Leonora we like
Coughlin's class hatred line.

18:41.761 --> 18:45.720
This is Officer Kohver. She's sure
she saw your man last night.

18:45.721 --> 18:48.360
We were responding to a burglary
in the building.

18:48.361 --> 18:51.240
We spoke to a number of tenants
on this floor.

18:51.241 --> 18:53.160
And one man,

18:53.161 --> 18:56.521
there was something about him,
and he looked a lot like this.

19:18.561 --> 19:20.801
Evening.

19:25.761 --> 19:27.480
Could I see your bag, sir?

19:27.481 --> 19:30.481
Oh. It's probably the boot.

19:31.361 --> 19:34.160
Thank you, that's fine.

19:34.161 --> 19:35.321
Thank you.

19:37.121 --> 19:39.960
He had a British passport
in the name of Peter Gibson.

19:39.961 --> 19:42.240
How did Gibson pay?
Credit card.

19:42.241 --> 19:44.600
We're checking to see
if the card has been used.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.481
I'll also get forensic team in
for prints and DNA.

19:50.401 --> 19:52.920
Hopefully, we can match results
to what we found in Hungary.

19:52.921 --> 19:55.000
And get Officer Kovher
in with the artist.

19:55.001 --> 19:57.161
See if we can get
a better likeness.

19:59.201 --> 20:01.320
Uh... These please.

20:01.321 --> 20:03.120
And I'll get four of the nuts

20:03.121 --> 20:05.961
and... and four
of these chocolate bars.

20:08.241 --> 20:10.000
How much will that be?
Thirty Euros, please.

20:10.001 --> 20:12.881
Thirty. Thirty Euros, Christ.

20:18.441 --> 20:19.681
Thank you.

20:20.801 --> 20:23.800
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

20:23.801 --> 20:26.360
The concert is about to begin.

24:03.601 --> 24:05.120
'All good?'

24:05.121 --> 24:07.721
Yeah, good, thank you.

24:34.241 --> 24:36.440
So, they're Russian?

24:36.441 --> 24:39.241
The Estonians are convinced
they are. Have a look at this.

24:45.241 --> 24:48.320
Yeah, someone is going out of
their way to try and kill me.

24:48.321 --> 24:49.840
OK, we get it, you're a big deal.

24:49.841 --> 24:52.720
OK, we've updated
the facial composite.

24:52.721 --> 24:55.560
Ilves is distributing this
to every cop in Estonia,

24:55.561 --> 24:57.840
as well as airports, ports,
railway stations,

24:57.841 --> 25:00.280
car rental offices, and the venue.

25:00.281 --> 25:02.320
What do you think?

25:02.321 --> 25:05.400
Well, the Jackal never looks
the same way twice, does he?

25:05.401 --> 25:08.160
Ilves says Peter Gibson hasn't
used his credit card in Tallinn

25:08.161 --> 25:10.560
since he paid for the Airbnb.

25:45.521 --> 25:47.521
Let's see
what he's had for breakfast.

25:49.121 --> 25:50.960
The old system was perfectly good.

25:50.961 --> 25:54.000
But it couldn't do this.

25:59.561 --> 26:01.320
Keith?

26:01.321 --> 26:03.720
Bianca Pullman.
Vince Pyne.

26:03.721 --> 26:06.081
We work for Osi Halcrow.

26:07.001 --> 26:09.841
Alright. Uh... Meet our guy.

26:11.681 --> 26:14.160
How accurate is this?
A local policewoman had eyes on him,

26:14.161 --> 26:15.920
as close as I am to you,

26:15.921 --> 26:18.160
for a minute or two.

26:18.161 --> 26:20.320
OK. It's gonna be very helpful.

26:20.321 --> 26:24.321
Yeah. Uh... There's also this.

26:25.761 --> 26:27.320
Who am I looking at?

26:27.321 --> 26:29.920
The Jackal in one of his disguises.

26:29.921 --> 26:31.520
Seriously?

26:31.521 --> 26:34.720
Maybe not so helpful, eh?

26:34.721 --> 26:36.761
How do I look?

26:39.121 --> 26:41.241
I want everyone gone by 1800 hours.

26:42.201 --> 26:44.600
From 1800 the entire building
is locked down.

26:44.601 --> 26:48.520
No-one gets in or out
without my personal authorisation.

26:52.481 --> 26:54.560
We'll keep
these upper levels empty

26:54.561 --> 26:57.601
with just armed guards up here
covering the audience.

27:00.681 --> 27:03.720
Keith, I've got
a present for your dogs.

27:03.721 --> 27:05.761
The Jackal left this behind.

27:06.641 --> 27:09.361
Hm.
It could have his scent on it.

27:32.361 --> 27:36.001
UDC will arrive in the green room
20 minutes before the presentation.

27:37.601 --> 27:40.281
It's sterile.

27:48.681 --> 27:51.601
When the lights go out,
Rima will make a short introduction.

27:52.641 --> 27:56.160
And UDC will make his announcement
behind the bullet-proof glass.

27:56.161 --> 27:59.920
The entire media crew's
under DagHaus direction.

27:59.921 --> 28:02.961
They have the exclusive feed
going to all the networks.

28:18.601 --> 28:20.281
'Is this worth it?'

28:29.401 --> 28:32.440
'Always alone, Mr Calthrop.'
'Always.'

28:32.441 --> 28:34.001
To eat alone is sad.

28:35.081 --> 28:36.920
Yeah, it is pretty sad.

28:39.481 --> 28:41.000
Now, what does that mean?

28:41.001 --> 28:43.160
We say in Spain,
better alone than in bad company.

28:43.161 --> 28:44.880
Or no?
Yeah.

29:07.601 --> 29:11.121
Fucking hell.

29:23.481 --> 29:25.601
- Hey.
- Evening, Alberto.

29:27.881 --> 29:30.281
Evening.
Buenas noches, Mr Calthrop.

29:31.201 --> 29:33.360
Please will you call me Charles?

29:33.361 --> 29:35.081
"Cholls."

29:35.961 --> 29:38.120
Charles.
Charles.

29:38.121 --> 29:40.080
Good, that was perfect!
Oh, thank you.

29:40.081 --> 29:42.240
Um...
I get your table ready.

29:42.241 --> 29:43.721
No, it's not actually, I was...

29:44.681 --> 29:47.081
I was wondering,
do you ever get a night off?

29:48.921 --> 29:50.800
Yes. I'm not a slave.

29:52.881 --> 29:55.240
Well, uh... if...

29:55.241 --> 29:57.120
when you get a night off,

29:57.121 --> 30:00.201
I was wondering if I could persuade
you to go to dinner with me?

30:02.121 --> 30:03.521
Yes, of course.

30:57.278 --> 30:59.517
'Speculation's at fever pitch

30:59.518 --> 31:02.277
here in Estonia, where a massive
security operation is already

31:02.278 --> 31:04.837

the entire building.

33:01.718 --> 33:04.877
Yeah? Ask her for a selfie.

Hi, I'm Rima.
Hello, it's so good to meet you.

33:08.398 --> 33:11.397
Come. Come this way.
I'll take you to the green room.

33:11.398 --> 33:14.597
Plane just landed.
UDC is ten minutes away.

33:14.598 --> 33:16.677
Guess that means
he's not cancelling, then.

33:16.678 --> 33:18.798
He won't be turning back now.

34:25.318 --> 34:27.437
Remember to stay close
to the glass, sir.

34:27.438 --> 34:30.797
Oh, my God, there he is.

34:30.798 --> 34:33.517

Oh, I'm good.

34:36.638 --> 34:38.037
Thank you for doing this.

Are you kidding? It's an honour!

Ladies and gentlemen,

please welcome your host
for this evening,

35:57.238 --> 35:59.277
the activist, satirist

35:59.278 --> 36:02.357
and provocateur, Rima Buttons.

36:09.198 --> 36:12.438
Rima! Hey!

36:19.238 --> 36:22.797
Am I looking at the luckiest
people on the planet, or what?

36:25.278 --> 36:27.517
Not only the most intelligent,

36:27.518 --> 36:29.597
the best dressed, and uh...

36:29.598 --> 36:31.878
possibly even the best looking...

36:33.078 --> 36:35.797
...but definitely the luckiest.

36:35.798 --> 36:38.757
Because you are witnessing history,

36:38.758 --> 36:40.797
right here, right now!

37:24.358 --> 37:26.757
I'll let you in on
a little secret.

37:26.758 --> 37:29.117
The world as we know it...

37:29.118 --> 37:31.237
'..is doomed.'

37:31.238 --> 37:33.077
Yep. Apparently we're doomed.

37:33.078 --> 37:35.317
I heard.
'Yeah, I know. The warm up act

37:35.318 --> 37:38.397
is supposed to warm you up,
not scare the shit out of you.

37:38.398 --> 37:40.277
But come on, I flattered you.'

37:40.278 --> 37:43.957
She's so cool.
'We need to have a serious talk.

37:43.958 --> 37:47.597
I mean you, and I mean
the millions of people watching this

37:47.598 --> 37:49.877
on their phones and TVs
around the world.'

37:49.878 --> 37:52.317
Some of us,

37:52.318 --> 37:55.198
no, most of us,
have loads of stuff.

37:56.558 --> 37:59.797
Well, we're not exactly lining up
at the soup kitchens, are we?

37:59.798 --> 38:03.037
Don't be embarrassed about it.
But just because we have stuff,

38:03.038 --> 38:04.997
doesn't mean we're not fucked.

38:04.998 --> 38:07.677
We're in denial.

38:07.678 --> 38:10.157
We keep pretending nothing bad

38:10.158 --> 38:12.637
is happening when we know it is.

38:12.638 --> 38:14.677
Come on, repeat after me.

38:14.678 --> 38:17.317
We're fucked!
We're fucked!

38:17.318 --> 38:19.277
We have to change, and we know it.

38:19.278 --> 38:21.877
And that change
has to start with money,

38:21.878 --> 38:23.437
because money equals power.

38:23.438 --> 38:26.917
And when has power
ever wanted change?

38:26.918 --> 38:31.197
Change is like kryptonite for
people with power. They go all...

38:31.198 --> 38:33.957
'Urgh...'

38:33.958 --> 38:35.717
Who is this?

38:35.718 --> 38:37.477
She's nobody.

38:37.478 --> 38:39.597
'A hundred years ago, women said...

38:39.598 --> 38:40.917
give us the vote.

38:40.918 --> 38:45.437
Power went, "No, that would be
the end of the world.'

38:45.438 --> 38:48.197
Feed the poor.
No, you can't do that.

38:48.198 --> 38:50.637
The poor will always be with us!

38:50.638 --> 38:54.317
Power won't give up.
It will never surrender.

38:55.758 --> 38:57.397
It has to be forced.

38:57.398 --> 38:59.917

38:59.918 --> 39:03.077
...to do it. Ladies, gentlemen,

Friends, thank you for joining me
here tonight.

40:10.518 --> 40:12.558
I know you've all come a long way.

40:14.078 --> 40:16.437
I'm gonna ask you now...

40:16.438 --> 40:18.677
to come even further.

40:18.678 --> 40:21.678
I want you...

40:23.278 --> 40:26.278
'..to come on a journey with me.'

40:27.318 --> 40:28.397
I'll come!

40:28.398 --> 40:30.077
I won't lie to you,

40:30.078 --> 40:32.717
the journey will not be
an easy one to make.

40:32.718 --> 40:36.117
For some, it will involve
giving up stuff,

40:36.118 --> 40:38.158
like Rima said.

40:40.318 --> 40:43.078
But it has to be done.

40:44.158 --> 40:46.677
It has to be done!

40:48.798 --> 40:50.237
The rich...

40:50.238 --> 40:51.877
'have become so rich...'

40:51.878 --> 40:53.277
He's nauseating.

40:53.278 --> 40:56.437
'..the powerful have
become so powerful,

40:56.438 --> 40:59.837
the corrupt have become so corrupt.

40:59.838 --> 41:03.478
'The rich, corrupt, and powerful...'

41:05.078 --> 41:08.638
...have taken away
what belongs to the many...

41:10.478 --> 41:13.077
...and hidden it

41:13.078 --> 41:15.558
where only a few can find it.

41:19.718 --> 41:22.997
And River is gonna lead you

41:22.998 --> 41:26.077
to where it is so you can come

41:26.078 --> 41:29.237
and take back what's...

41:29.238 --> 41:31.158
...yours!

41:33.038 --> 41:34.437
Fuck you, you tyrant!

41:45.038 --> 41:47.038
Come on.

41:52.238 --> 41:54.557
There were two shooters.
He's in here somewhere.

41:54.558 --> 41:57.158
Lock all the exits. Let's go.

42:11.678 --> 42:13.398
What the fuck was that?!

42:15.238 --> 42:16.957
What the fuck just happened?!

42:16.958 --> 42:18.718
Is the motherfucker dead?

42:19.878 --> 42:21.957
OK, give me the remote.
No!

42:21.958 --> 42:24.478
Gimme the remote.
Give me the fucking remote!

42:37.318 --> 42:39.318
Close the fucking doors!

42:40.758 --> 42:42.238
Here!
Close the doors!

42:43.398 --> 42:45.078
No, we won't close the doors.

43:21.318 --> 43:22.758
