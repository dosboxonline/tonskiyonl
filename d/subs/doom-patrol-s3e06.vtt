Why am I? Mmm, another

is as good as mine,

why I'm here,

30:37.468 --> 30:40.371
No, it's never been easy.

30:42.140 --> 30:44.475
Their lives
have been bloody awful.

30:44.542 --> 30:50.748
But at some point,
they chose to be happy
in spite of everything,

30:50.849 --> 30:54.752
took comfort in that struggle.

30:54.853 --> 31:01.926
When I met them I realized
that I needed to protect
their weird and wonderful ways.

31:02.026 --> 31:04.596
And the Bureau let you?

31:04.696 --> 31:07.732
Oh, they haven't
bothered me yet.

31:07.832 --> 31:13.938
This is their protest.
A life well-lived.

31:14.038 --> 31:15.573
What about you?

31:16.841 --> 31:19.944
I'm a tad more complicated.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.783
What are those two up to?

31:25.884 --> 31:31.589
[chuckles] Their zany creation.
Oh, it's absurd, really.

31:31.689 --> 31:37.228
I'm afraid some think of Dada
as more than a temporary fling

31:37.295 --> 31:40.865
and carry the wild idea
that it can change the world.

31:40.932 --> 31:45.069
But why shouldn't they risk it?

31:45.136 --> 31:47.872
Follow their mad bliss,

31:47.939 --> 31:51.376
plant their flag
and stand for something?

31:51.442 --> 31:54.712
Bendy, you may have
lived a charmed life,

31:55.780 --> 31:57.315
but from where I sit,

31:57.415 --> 31:59.384
I'm lucky
to be standing at all.

32:00.551 --> 32:03.488
Not everyone can
take that kind of risk.

32:03.588 --> 32:09.327
No, Lloyd.
I suppose you're right.

32:22.507 --> 32:24.175
[bicycle chain rattling]

32:25.777 --> 32:27.145
Whoa.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.601
-Whoa!
-[gasps]

32:50.668 --> 32:54.005
[Jane] No, no, no, no Kay.
Kay, let me up.

32:54.105 --> 32:56.174
You don't know him,
don't talk to him.

32:56.274 --> 32:57.375
You okay?

32:57.475 --> 33:00.778
Um, yeah, I'm okay. Thanks.

33:01.479 --> 33:02.547
You just learning?

33:04.816 --> 33:06.784
Well, you're doing
pretty darn good.

33:06.851 --> 33:11.823
But if it were me,
I'd pay a bit more attention
to these cars. Much safer.

33:13.358 --> 33:14.692
Take care now.

33:20.999 --> 33:22.500
[softly] Okay.

33:27.905 --> 33:31.909
[Larry] The Bureau's known
for going to any lengths
to secure a target.

33:32.010 --> 33:35.046
They have no qualms pitting
family against each other.

33:35.146 --> 33:36.981
I'm sorry you got sucked in.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.752
I didn't. I chose this.

33:40.852 --> 33:42.820
What? Why?

33:44.389 --> 33:45.923
Really wasn't
that far a stretch,

33:46.024 --> 33:49.394
what with the abandonment
and the mom going insane,

33:49.494 --> 33:51.763
brother offing himself,
son getting shot.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.531
Can't believe it took me
so long to realize

33:53.598 --> 33:55.333
the Bureau's where
I always belonged.

33:55.400 --> 33:56.834
But the Bureau is evil.

33:56.901 --> 34:00.705
-[chair creaking]
-This can't be
who you are, son.

34:00.772 --> 34:02.006
It can't be.

34:03.674 --> 34:06.244
At least I didn't run away
with my tail between my legs.

34:07.045 --> 34:08.746
And don't call me son.

34:08.846 --> 34:12.950
That implies that
you were actually at
my Little League games.

34:13.051 --> 34:17.188
Or helped me with algebra,
told me what to do
on a fucking first date.

34:17.255 --> 34:18.723
You weren't there!

34:19.791 --> 34:21.759
You weren't there,
Larry Trainor!

34:22.727 --> 34:25.930
Not for me. Or Gary. Or Mom.

34:27.732 --> 34:29.734
So drop the Dad routine

34:29.801 --> 34:32.970
because it implies
responsibility for something
other than your goddamn self.

34:33.071 --> 34:35.706
No, I stayed away
to protect you.

34:36.707 --> 34:39.410
You stayed away to protect you!

34:39.477 --> 34:43.481
Face it,
you sucked at being a dad.

34:43.581 --> 34:46.651
Accept that. Make things
a lot easier for us.

34:47.919 --> 34:50.721
[Larry] We don't all get
to choose our paths.

34:50.788 --> 34:52.990
You think I wanted
to burn up in my plane

34:53.091 --> 34:54.826
and become
some nuclear accident?

34:54.926 --> 34:57.161
You think I raised my hand
at flight school,

34:57.261 --> 35:00.498
volunteered to have
an alien entity merge
with my body,

35:00.598 --> 35:03.568
basically making me
a radioactive pariah?

35:03.634 --> 35:06.671
You think I enjoy
wrapping my body
everyday in bandages

35:06.771 --> 35:09.440
and unwrapping them
just to take a piss?

35:09.507 --> 35:14.312
Do you think it's been fun
to not touch anyone
for 70 goddamn years?

35:16.981 --> 35:18.249
[Larry sighing]

35:18.316 --> 35:22.353
And until today, yeah,
I selfishly wanted more.

35:22.453 --> 35:27.592
But if my being around you
is so harmful,
then I'm done trying.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.529
I am your father.

35:31.629 --> 35:34.465
I loved you from the moment
you were born.

35:34.532 --> 35:39.370
Actually, no, from the moment
I knew you were on the way.

35:39.470 --> 35:43.708
I sat next to your mom's tummy,
and we listened to Game 1
of the World Series.

35:43.808 --> 35:46.043
And when Willie Mays
caught that fly ball

35:46.144 --> 35:48.813
and when we cheered,
you kicked.

35:48.880 --> 35:52.483
Your foot was as big
as an orange slice
and I knew you'd be tall.

35:53.951 --> 35:55.887
You can't take that from me.

35:58.222 --> 36:03.327
And even after I left,
in my mind, I stayed.

36:03.394 --> 36:07.899
But maybe that doesn't count.
And maybe you can't forgive me,

36:07.999 --> 36:09.967
but I forgive myself.

36:12.570 --> 36:18.176
So if you're
feeling better now,
I'd like you to leave.

36:23.047 --> 36:24.382
[scoffs]

36:31.055 --> 36:32.723
[Larry sighs]

36:32.823 --> 36:34.392
[door closes]

36:58.382 --> 37:00.017
[Elinore]<i> Your father</i>
<i>and I used to have this ritual</i>

37:02.086 --> 37:05.256

You were right.

In the best way possible.

39:39.377 --> 39:40.778

39:54.592 --> 39:57.027
[Agent Burdette] God almighty,
look at that thing.

39:57.094 --> 39:59.463
It's so ugly,
I can't look away.

39:59.563 --> 40:02.266
This is why they're not
supposed to be up here.

40:02.366 --> 40:05.636
How can you stomach any food?
It's grotesque.

Piffle paffle. Piffle paffle.

Piffle paffle. Piffle paffle!

[breath trembling]

42:31.882 --> 42:33.951
[all sigh in relief]

42:34.051 --> 42:35.719
I thought we were done for.

42:35.786 --> 42:38.022
We are the Sisterhood of Dada

42:38.088 --> 42:40.190
and I will stand by you
till the day I die.

42:40.257 --> 42:41.725
But for now, we have got to go

42:41.792 --> 42:44.762
because the actual guards
are on their way. Come on.

42:45.729 --> 42:47.898
Clowns, Sachiko? Really?

42:47.965 --> 42:50.768
-You couldn't have
turned them into kittens?

Oh, come on. Come on.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.813
[footsteps approaching]

43:02.913 --> 43:05.716
Well, if it isn't
Dr. Preparation H

43:05.783 --> 43:07.217
and the Tattle Tale Twin.

43:07.284 --> 43:10.120
That could
have gone very badly.

43:10.220 --> 43:14.391
You may be primary
but you can't take risks
like this.

43:25.102 --> 43:27.438
Thanks, Jane. It was great.

43:31.008 --> 43:32.676
She looks pretty happy to me.

43:32.776 --> 43:35.479
She doesn't
understand the danger.
Can't you see that?

43:35.579 --> 43:36.847
I just watched a girl

43:36.947 --> 43:38.682
teach herself
how to ride a bike

43:38.782 --> 43:42.686
after being held captive
in her own mind
for almost 70 years.

43:42.786 --> 43:46.357
In one afternoon,
she freed herself
from that bondage

43:46.457 --> 43:48.592
and found a little joy.

43:50.527 --> 43:52.429
Some things are worth the risk.

43:52.496 --> 43:54.198
Well, it'd be nice

43:54.298 --> 43:57.167
if all the personas
could have been
consulted beforehand.

43:57.267 --> 44:00.704
Look, she gets better,
we get better.

44:00.804 --> 44:02.606
I didn't always
think like this.

44:02.673 --> 44:07.111
But when I saw
the wind in her hair
and the sun on her face,

44:07.177 --> 44:11.181
I realized
this is the next step.

44:11.281 --> 44:13.217
This is what growth looks like.

44:13.317 --> 44:14.985
Our fates are all intertwined--

44:15.052 --> 44:17.354
You have no idea
what growth looks like.

44:17.454 --> 44:19.723
If you don't stop
this divisive behavior,

44:19.823 --> 44:22.226
you'll get exactly
what you want.

44:24.061 --> 44:25.996
What's that supposed to mean?

44:29.400 --> 44:32.569
Mmm. Figured.

44:32.670 --> 44:34.004
More idle threats

44:34.071 --> 44:37.207
from a second-rate doctor
in cheap shoes.

44:38.342 --> 44:40.044
That's a burn, Dr. H.

44:52.690 --> 44:54.358
Now what?

44:54.425 --> 44:58.028
For starters,
no more idle threats.

45:02.533 --> 45:08.338
[Cliff crying]
I had three of a kind.

45:08.405 --> 45:10.441
I thought we were
going up the river

45:10.541 --> 45:14.044
so I went all in
and now it's gone.

45:14.111 --> 45:15.612
All gone!

45:15.713 --> 45:17.514
[Ginger]<i> You'll</i>

45:28.292 --> 45:31.462
I mean, it's basically my DNA.

45:31.562 --> 45:33.397
I can't sell that stuff.

45:33.464 --> 45:35.899
I already sold
half my roomies' stuff.

Hey, I'm here
to see Dr. Chalmers
about synthetic skin.

46:05.929 --> 46:08.565
-Do you have an appointment?
-I think so.

46:08.632 --> 46:10.067
I booked it online.

46:10.134 --> 46:12.102
-I can check. Let's see.
-Thanks.

46:12.169 --> 46:13.637
-[keyboard clacking]
-Cyborg.

46:13.737 --> 46:15.939
Actually, I booked it
under Vic Stone.

46:17.941 --> 46:19.343
Right.

46:23.013 --> 46:26.817
Here you are. Dr. Chalmers
will be with you in a minute.

46:26.917 --> 46:28.318
Meantime, have a seat

46:28.418 --> 46:30.187
and fill out
this questionnaire.

46:30.287 --> 46:31.789
Thanks.

46:42.633 --> 46:46.370
"What is it
you want to change
about yourself and why?"

46:51.208 --> 46:54.812
[softly] "How will
your life improve

47:19.670 --> 47:22.306
Oh! What is happening?

47:23.340 --> 47:25.542
[screaming]

47:26.476 --> 47:28.345
[groaning in pain]

47:33.183 --> 47:35.686
[coughs and strains]

47:49.700 --> 47:51.201
[footsteps approaching]

47:52.069 --> 47:53.570
[Rita clears throat]

47:56.373 --> 47:59.943
I was hoping
if I stood here long enough,

48:00.043 --> 48:02.546
this great metal beast
would say something.

48:02.613 --> 48:05.682
Anything. So I could know
why I'm here.

48:07.618 --> 48:09.720
Not that
it really matters, but...

48:12.756 --> 48:14.691
I don't really care why.

48:17.594 --> 48:20.230
I just thank my lucky stars

48:20.297 --> 48:23.400
that you chose this time,
this place.

48:24.768 --> 48:27.871
And if this thing
should suddenly jump to life...

48:30.107 --> 48:31.875
I understand
if you wanna go back.

48:32.743 --> 48:34.978
Back to what?

48:35.078 --> 48:39.783
I'm happy here.
Life makes sense.

48:39.883 --> 48:43.253
I don't want to run
just because I fear
what the Bureau's becoming,

48:43.320 --> 48:48.558
but what if they try
to do away with us
completely?

48:48.625 --> 48:52.329
What if my purpose
was to take the Sisterhood
away from here

48:52.429 --> 48:53.764
to some place safe?

48:55.599 --> 48:57.834
Hmm.

48:57.935 --> 49:00.137
I think your ship
was built for one.

49:01.805 --> 49:04.308
Oh.

49:04.408 --> 49:07.344
What if your purpose
was to show us

49:07.444 --> 49:10.614
how to bend and stretch
towards a better world?

49:10.681 --> 49:12.516
-[chuckling]
-Huh?

49:12.616 --> 49:15.285
Do you think there's something
better out there?

49:17.487 --> 49:20.857
I can't imagine what.

49:22.626 --> 49:24.027
Somehow, somewhere,

49:24.127 --> 49:28.999
I climbed into that metal beast
and journeyed here.

49:30.634 --> 49:33.670
I found what
I was looking for and more.

49:35.472 --> 49:38.875
Honestly, Malcolm,
why do we always think

49:38.976 --> 49:43.814
there's something
better out there
just beyond our reach?

49:43.880 --> 49:46.216
What could be
better than right here?

49:46.316 --> 49:48.285
[chuckles softly] Right now?

49:50.153 --> 49:53.323
I'm staying. I'm staying!

49:53.390 --> 49:55.158
[chuckles softly] Good.

49:57.227 --> 49:58.695
That's good.

50:05.635 --> 50:06.903
[footsteps approaching]

50:10.073 --> 50:12.342
[both chuckling]

50:12.409 --> 50:14.177
-Oh, I almost forgot.
-Hmm?

50:14.244 --> 50:16.513
I, um, made you something.

50:20.317 --> 50:21.585
Your paperclip.

50:21.685 --> 50:23.754
[both chuckle]

50:26.423 --> 50:30.861
I believe I know
the perfect place to keep this.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.341
May I?

50:59.256 --> 51:00.924
[cage door creaking open]

51:11.368 --> 51:13.904
[breathes deeply]
For safekeeping.

51:14.938 --> 51:16.973
I'll guard it with my life.

51:23.914 --> 51:25.949
Sisterhood of Dada.

51:26.049 --> 51:29.619
Whatever you're after,
it won't be me.

51:34.257 --> 51:35.725
[glass breaking]

51:36.827 --> 51:38.462
[voice 1]<i> Or maybe it will.</i>

51:38.562 --> 51:39.930
[voice 2]<i> Or maybe it will.</i>

51:39.996 --> 51:41.398
[voice 3]<i> Or maybe it will.</i>

51:41.465 --> 51:43.500
[fire roaring]
