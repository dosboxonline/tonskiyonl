deemed you "special."

to be somebody.

you broke my nose.

- My hat's off to you, sir.

47:28.976 --> 47:29.910
- Truly.
- What? This...

47:30.045 --> 47:31.907
I didn't... He's...
That's... I...

47:32.043 --> 47:33.539
I... I don't--

47:33.675 --> 47:35.577
- [Deadpool gasps]
- [heart beats]

47:38.714 --> 47:39.719
[Deadpool]
Not my favorite Chris.

47:39.855 --> 47:41.118
You stupid piece of shit.

47:41.254 --> 47:42.219
You just got him
fucking killed!

47:42.355 --> 47:44.125
[Deadpool] Hey!
We're all grieving!

47:44.260 --> 47:46.427
PS, do you know what
he was doing to the budget?

47:46.562 --> 47:47.754
[shushing]

47:49.060 --> 47:51.527
Alioth is hungry.

47:51.662 --> 47:53.230
[Deadpool] There's been
some kind of mistake.

47:53.366 --> 47:55.234
Big yellow is
a back-up Anchor Being,

47:55.369 --> 47:57.902
and I'm Marvel Jesus.
MJ, if you're nasty.

47:58.038 --> 47:58.972
This may be hard to hear,

47:59.108 --> 48:00.699
but there's
another British villain

48:00.835 --> 48:01.839
who's gonna destroy
my universe,

48:01.975 --> 48:03.010
and I'm gonna stop him.

48:03.145 --> 48:04.546
Oh, honey,
you don't really strike me

48:04.682 --> 48:06.278
as the world-saving type.

48:07.180 --> 48:08.549
[thunder rumbling in distance]

48:08.684 --> 48:10.414
Did I hit a nerve?

48:10.550 --> 48:12.251
[Deadpool] I didn't want it
to come to this.

48:12.886 --> 48:13.822
Either you help us

48:13.958 --> 48:15.187
or my friend here
is gonna sing

48:15.323 --> 48:17.019
the entire second act
of <i>Music Man</i>

48:17.154 --> 48:18.389
with zero warm-up.

48:19.092 --> 48:20.257
Where'd you get the chair?

48:20.393 --> 48:21.324
[Cassandra Nova]
Well, once in a while,

48:21.460 --> 48:23.388
I do get a Charles
through here.

48:23.524 --> 48:24.831
Never mine, though.

48:24.967 --> 48:28.037
No. He didn't care to find me.

48:28.172 --> 48:31.636
[Deadpool groans] Gen Z
and their trauma-bragging!

48:31.771 --> 48:34.610
Can't you just stuff it down,
turn it into accomplishment

48:34.746 --> 48:36.239
or cancer like the rest of us?

48:36.374 --> 48:38.108
But I'm not like
the rest of you.

48:38.243 --> 48:40.014
Except maybe the Wolverine.

48:40.150 --> 48:42.715
Now, we could be
truly terrifying together.

48:42.851 --> 48:44.048
You're that scary, huh?

48:44.184 --> 48:46.383
The TVA certainly thought so.

48:46.519 --> 48:49.055
They sent me here
before I could walk.

48:49.191 --> 48:50.559
And you know,
it's the best thing

48:50.695 --> 48:52.361
that ever happened to me.

48:52.496 --> 48:53.522
I love it here.

48:53.658 --> 48:54.888
[Deadpool] You live
in a garbage dump.

48:55.024 --> 48:58.027
I think we both know who lives
in the garbage dump.

48:58.163 --> 48:59.902
The Void is a paradise.

49:00.037 --> 49:04.038
I can wield my power here
without shame.

49:04.174 --> 49:06.035
Unfortunately I had
no Charles Xavier

49:06.171 --> 49:08.037
to teach me temperance.

49:08.173 --> 49:10.039
What about your Charles?

49:10.175 --> 49:11.476
Did he protect you?

49:12.112 --> 49:14.145
Did he make you feel safe?

49:14.281 --> 49:16.114
We're mutants.
We're never safe.

49:16.250 --> 49:18.615
- [roars]
- [Cassandra whoops]

49:18.984 --> 49:20.154
[chuckles]

49:20.556 --> 49:21.617
[whoops]

49:24.326 --> 49:25.256
[Deadpool] Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

49:25.391 --> 49:27.060
I don't...
I don't want the smoke.

49:27.195 --> 49:28.259
I don't have
any beef with you.

49:28.395 --> 49:29.896
I just want
to save my friends.

49:30.031 --> 49:31.198
I just... I want to go home.

49:31.333 --> 49:33.065
Well, the thing is,
I could get you home.

49:33.200 --> 49:34.870
- Good.
- But I don't want to.

49:35.005 --> 49:37.270
[Deadpool] Not good.
[groaning]

49:39.668 --> 49:42.100
What do you want, Wade Wilson?

49:42.236 --> 49:44.646
[Deadpool straining] Your...
fingers are inside me,

49:44.781 --> 49:45.972
but not in a good way.

49:46.107 --> 49:48.882
My brother could enter
one's mind with a thought.

49:49.018 --> 49:51.216
I have to get my hands dirty.

49:51.352 --> 49:53.649
- [Deadpool groaning]
- [shushing]

49:54.383 --> 49:55.651
I've got you.

49:57.994 --> 49:59.391
[whispers] <i>I've got you...</i>

50:01.791 --> 50:03.032
[Wade, muffled]
<i>What do you mean?</i>

50:04.664 --> 50:07.403
I can't... I can't reach you.
You're not here.

50:07.538 --> 50:09.104
I'm right here.

50:09.240 --> 50:12.105
- No, you're not. I can't...
- I'm right here.

50:12.241 --> 50:14.439
Then show me.
You got to do something.

50:15.679 --> 50:17.003
Show you what?

50:17.138 --> 50:20.876
Show me you care about
something bigger than you.

50:21.011 --> 50:25.044
<i>Ever since they turned you
down, you took a knee.</i>

50:25.713 --> 50:27.683
Baby, you never got back up.

50:29.852 --> 50:31.617
I know you're
going through something.

50:31.753 --> 50:34.528
Let me go through it with you.

50:34.664 --> 50:37.066
- Your crazy matches my crazy.
- Your crazy matches my crazy.

50:40.164 --> 50:41.566
Where'd you go?

50:42.068 --> 50:43.534
[Wade] Oh, my God.

50:44.899 --> 50:46.400
[♪ melancholy music playing]

50:46.535 --> 50:48.209
<i>You just say it. Okay?</i>

50:48.945 --> 50:49.876
<i>Say, "I don't want you.</i>

50:50.012 --> 50:52.346
<i>"I don't want to be with you."</i>

50:52.482 --> 50:53.806
<i>Go ahead. Say it.
Say... Say, "I don't..."</i>

50:53.942 --> 50:55.282
Say it.
You don't wanna be with me.

50:55.417 --> 50:56.785
<i>Tell me that
and I'll walk away.</i>

50:56.920 --> 50:57.843
<i>Say, "I don't want you."</i>

50:57.978 --> 51:00.287
[♪ melancholy music continues]

51:04.122 --> 51:05.684
[sighs] Fuck...

51:05.819 --> 51:08.460
You'll never fucking matter.

51:12.360 --> 51:14.093
What?

51:14.228 --> 51:16.939
- You'll never fucking matter.
- Fucking matter.

51:17.074 --> 51:19.405
[♪ melancholy music continues]

51:22.974 --> 51:25.506
- [Vanessa] <i>You'll...</i>
- [Cassandra] <i>You'll...</i>

51:25.641 --> 51:27.443
never...
<i>- never...</i>

51:27.578 --> 51:28.707
- fucking...
- fucking...

51:28.843 --> 51:31.681
matter.
<i>- matter...</i>

51:33.717 --> 51:34.955
[Deadpool]
She never said that.

51:35.091 --> 51:36.224
- [Cassandra] No.
- [groans]

51:36.360 --> 51:38.055
[in mocking tone]
But I bet she thought it.

51:38.191 --> 51:39.159
[Deadpool splutters]

51:39.295 --> 51:41.887
[Deadpool groans]
You are so mean!

51:42.023 --> 51:43.061
My brain could taste
your fingers,

51:43.197 --> 51:45.234
and they tasted like hate!

51:45.369 --> 51:47.968
And where in God's name
is the intimacy coordinator?

51:48.103 --> 51:50.806
You're so lost, Mr. Wilson.

51:50.942 --> 51:53.340
And long before you came here.

51:54.735 --> 51:55.670
This is Baby Knife.

51:55.806 --> 51:56.975
She's gonna fuck you
in the face now.

51:57.111 --> 51:58.279
If you want to kill me,

51:58.415 --> 52:00.111
it's going to take
more than a little blade.

52:00.247 --> 52:01.974
[Deadpool] How about six?

52:02.110 --> 52:05.687
[laughs mockingly]
My boy's wicked strong.

52:05.822 --> 52:07.347
That's my big boy.

52:07.483 --> 52:08.852
Yes, you are.

52:08.988 --> 52:10.258
[groans]

52:10.924 --> 52:12.128
[laughs]

52:15.023 --> 52:16.496
[Cassandra]
Well, this has been fun.

52:16.632 --> 52:18.792
But the big guy needs to eat,
and the rent is due.

52:18.928 --> 52:20.664
- [eerie roar]
- [thunder roaring]

52:22.332 --> 52:23.264
By the way,

52:23.399 --> 52:24.738
you're the rent.

52:24.873 --> 52:27.066
[rumbling]

52:34.783 --> 52:36.108

- Come on! Fuck!

52:46.857 --> 52:47.927
- [engine starts]
- You comin' or what?

52:48.062 --> 52:49.264
[Deadpool] Coming!

52:59.473 --> 53:01.672
[engine sputtering
in distance]

53:07.883 --> 53:09.080
[both groan]

53:09.216 --> 53:10.184
What you thinkin' 'bout?

53:10.320 --> 53:11.879
- Get the fuck off of me!
- Shh, shh, shh.

53:12.015 --> 53:14.013
- [strains] Almost done.
- Almost done what?

53:14.149 --> 53:15.957
Getting my knife out
of your buttocks,

53:16.093 --> 53:17.717
- pervert!
- Aah! Fuck!

53:17.853 --> 53:19.622
Get your mind out of my pants!

53:19.758 --> 53:22.056
- I'm telling Blake.
- New rules.

53:22.458 --> 53:23.562
I talk now.

53:23.697 --> 53:24.799
That's gonna be very hard
on the audience.

53:24.934 --> 53:27.429
Shut the fuck up!

53:27.564 --> 53:28.633
Let me fuckin' think.

53:28.768 --> 53:30.668
Now we gotta get back
to Paradox, right?

53:32.599 --> 53:34.101
Right?

53:34.237 --> 53:36.338
<i>Je m'excuse.</i> Am I allowed
to speak now or--

53:36.473 --> 53:38.742
Just nod, asshole.

53:40.409 --> 53:41.447
Right.

53:41.583 --> 53:42.878
Then we find the others
that poor kid, Johnny,

53:43.014 --> 53:44.152
was talking about
before you got him killed!

53:44.288 --> 53:45.978
[Deadpool] "Poor kid."
He's, like, 50!

53:46.113 --> 53:47.045
Yeah, if there's
a chance they know

53:47.181 --> 53:48.718
how to get out of here,
we find 'em.

53:48.854 --> 53:50.716
And make those TVA fuckers
fix my shit

53:50.852 --> 53:52.058
like you fucking promised!

53:52.194 --> 53:53.552
[Deadpool] I smell quest.

53:53.687 --> 53:55.187
[sniffing]

53:56.460 --> 53:57.464
I smell food.

54:00.594 --> 54:04.273
So what made you finally wear
an honest-to-God costume?

54:05.838 --> 54:07.904
Mine's red
so they can't see me bleed.

54:08.039 --> 54:10.772
But I could see how
yellow would be useful too.

54:10.908 --> 54:12.438
Have you been checked
for ADHD?

54:12.573 --> 54:13.739
Mm-mm.

54:13.875 --> 54:15.876
But I've had several STDs,

54:16.011 --> 54:18.081
which were probably caused
by ADHD.

54:18.216 --> 54:19.288
Fuck!

54:20.189 --> 54:21.356
What are you looking for?

54:21.891 --> 54:23.391
Oh. Thank fuck.

54:24.461 --> 54:26.228
No, no, no, no, no.
That's rubbing alcohol.

54:26.363 --> 54:27.754
You don't want to drink--
Oh, yeah.

54:27.890 --> 54:29.254
There you go. Fuck that liver.

54:29.690 --> 54:30.624
[exhales]

54:30.760 --> 54:32.631
- Good. Okay.
- [sighs]

54:33.663 --> 54:34.765
What the fuck are those?

54:35.398 --> 54:36.369
Oh.

54:36.505 --> 54:38.138
Back in civilian life,
I wear a toupee,

54:38.273 --> 54:39.873
but nobody knows. [chuckles]

54:40.008 --> 54:41.277
[laughing]

54:42.406 --> 54:44.005
Everybody knows.

54:46.449 --> 54:47.877
Wanna talk about
what's haunting you,

54:48.013 --> 54:50.148
or should we wait
for a third act flashback?

54:50.284 --> 54:52.387
Ah... Go fuck yourself.

54:55.650 --> 54:56.655
You know...

54:58.219 --> 55:00.560
in my world, you're...
[clears throat]

55:01.790 --> 55:02.897
You're well regarded.

55:03.033 --> 55:04.630
Yeah, well, not in mine.

55:05.633 --> 55:07.461
They don't like me much
in mine either.

55:07.597 --> 55:08.897
You don't say.

55:09.032 --> 55:11.098
I wanted to be something,
you know. I...

55:11.968 --> 55:13.602
Shit, I wanted
to be an Avenger.

55:13.738 --> 55:16.039
- Fuck the Avengers.
- Yeah.

55:16.174 --> 55:18.446
I didn't make the cut, though.
Same with the X-Men...

55:20.315 --> 55:21.316
When my girlfriend left me,

55:21.451 --> 55:23.011
- and I just--
- You had a girlfriend?

55:23.380 --> 55:24.419
Yeah.

55:24.821 --> 55:26.087
Vanessa.

55:26.223 --> 55:27.752
When we met, she was a dancer.

55:28.916 --> 55:30.117
We had a whole life.

55:31.356 --> 55:32.852
It was good.

55:32.988 --> 55:35.188
But, oh, boy, I just... Mwah.

55:36.264 --> 55:38.059
Fucked that right up.

55:38.769 --> 55:39.791
But you,

55:39.926 --> 55:41.160
you were an X-Man.

55:41.295 --> 55:43.372
Fuck that.
You were the X-Man. You...

55:45.107 --> 55:46.441
The Wolverine.

55:48.739 --> 55:50.379
He was a hero in my world.

55:52.147 --> 55:53.305
Yeah, well...

55:54.480 --> 55:55.615
he ain't shit in mine.

56:01.052 --> 56:03.656
You said, "Logan was a hero."
What happened?

56:04.553 --> 56:05.559
He died.

56:06.225 --> 56:07.619
How?

56:07.755 --> 56:10.089
Well, technically,
you were chest-fucked
by a tree, but,

56:10.225 --> 56:11.892
really, you just
ran out of batteries

56:12.027 --> 56:14.160
- trying to save someone.
- Who?

56:14.295 --> 56:16.070
The shitheels
that grew her in a lab

56:16.206 --> 56:17.736
called her "X-23." But...

56:18.537 --> 56:20.135
she was just a kid.

56:20.271 --> 56:23.804
A younger, daintier,
somehow meaner version of you.

56:23.939 --> 56:25.606
You died trying to save her.

56:25.741 --> 56:27.041
It was beautiful.

56:27.177 --> 56:30.078
Look, <i>mijo,</i>
I know you're hurtin'.

56:30.214 --> 56:32.511
My blind, elderly,
African-American roommate,

56:32.647 --> 56:35.787
Blind Al, always says that
pain teaches us who we are.

56:35.922 --> 56:37.488
Sometimes we need to listen
to that pain

56:37.623 --> 56:38.557
instead of running from it.

56:38.692 --> 56:40.221
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, she's wise.

56:40.356 --> 56:42.854

that his helmet is lying

- Cassandra melted the helmet.

was the only way

to protect anyone
from her powers.

The only other helmet that
strong is Juggernaut's,

01:12:06.353 --> 01:12:07.554
but he works for Cassandra.

01:12:07.689 --> 01:12:09.018

That's it.
