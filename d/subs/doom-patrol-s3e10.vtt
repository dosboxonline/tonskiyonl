WEBVTT

01:50.944 --> 01:53.913
[gasping]

01:53.980 --> 01:56.015
[glass crunching]

01:59.119 --> 02:00.520
[grunts]

02:27.981 --> 02:30.316
Hey Buddy?
You okay?

02:31.050 --> 02:33.153
It's okay.

02:33.219 --> 02:36.556
You're gonna be okay--
[exclaiming in pain]

02:36.656 --> 02:38.858
-Larry?
-I'm good. We're good.

02:40.360 --> 02:41.528
Are you all right?

02:43.563 --> 02:44.697
This is bad.

02:46.166 --> 02:49.736
We've been here before,
Battered, bruised.

02:49.836 --> 02:54.040
But we lick our wounds
and rise from the ashes,

02:54.140 --> 02:55.842
stronger than ever before.

02:55.909 --> 02:58.845
[Larry] Are you seriously
trying to give us
a rally speech right now?

02:58.912 --> 03:02.315
I am. Because that's exactly
what we're going to do.

03:02.382 --> 03:06.319
Rally and march to Florida,
and save Cliff.

03:06.386 --> 03:08.655
Oh, I get it.
You've flipped your pancake.

03:09.689 --> 03:11.524
Have you not been
paying attention?

03:11.591 --> 03:13.593
The bus is totaled.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.261
Larry's worm is going haywire.

03:16.262 --> 03:17.830
Look at Jane!

03:17.897 --> 03:21.267
Jane will spring back.
She always does.

03:21.367 --> 03:22.769
Everything will be fine.

03:26.539 --> 03:29.442
It's gonna be fine.
She screamed.

03:29.542 --> 03:30.843
Kids scream all the time

03:43.690 --> 03:46.626
Kay?

03:50.396 --> 03:51.431
[grunts]

04:05.078 --> 04:06.045
[gasps]

04:07.914 --> 04:09.082
See?

04:09.148 --> 04:12.952
She's back, like a spring lily.

04:13.052 --> 04:14.487
Not a moment too soon.

04:14.587 --> 04:18.257
These two were of the mind
that we should turn around

04:18.324 --> 04:20.159
instead of continuing
to Florida. Can you believe it?

04:20.260 --> 04:23.963
Yeah, I don't think
I'm in any shape
to help anyone right now.

04:29.102 --> 04:31.137
So, that's it?

04:32.772 --> 04:36.342
Are we really just
going to abandon Cliff?

04:38.611 --> 04:40.680
We can fix this.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.515
[Rita] We have to fix this.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.517
Don't you get it?

04:44.617 --> 04:46.953
We didn't crash because
Jane screamed or Larry
lost control of that thing.

04:47.020 --> 04:50.323
[Larry] He's right.
We're not built for this.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.592
Not anymore, no.

04:52.659 --> 04:54.160
Since I've known you all,
we've always argued this point.

04:54.260 --> 04:57.664
but now, I finally see
your side. Crystal clear.

04:57.764 --> 04:59.165
We're not a super team.

05:07.173 --> 05:08.274
Oh, no!

05:09.342 --> 05:11.144
[eerie sound echoing]

05:11.210 --> 05:13.179
[Larry] I thought we were
done with all this.

05:16.983 --> 05:20.720
No. Whatever you're up to,
I want no part of it.

05:20.820 --> 05:24.123
You were unsatisfied
with the results
of The Flagellation.

05:24.190 --> 05:28.027
But if only you could see
the effect it had on people
across the globe,

05:28.127 --> 05:30.697
The only thing I saw
was Laura de Mille

05:30.797 --> 05:34.067
waltzing off completely
unscathed and unrepentant.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.169
-You don't know that.
-[Rita] Nor do you.

05:36.235 --> 05:39.339
So, I'm going to do
with my bare hands

05:39.405 --> 05:43.509
what you couldn't
with song and dance
and masked fucking birds.

05:44.811 --> 05:47.080
Is this what Malcolm
would've wanted for?

05:50.016 --> 05:51.184
We'll never know.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.553
[Shelly] She betrayed
us all, Rita.

05:53.653 --> 05:56.089
But I know
she isn't completely lost.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.224
And neither are you.

06:30.056 --> 06:31.257
[gasps]

06:32.558 --> 06:35.695
-Oh, fuck!
<i>-Bonjour, madame.</i>

06:37.397 --> 06:39.098
Where the fuck am I?

06:39.198 --> 06:41.868
[Mallah] This is where
the Brotherhood
deposits its garbage.

06:41.934 --> 06:43.102
[Madame Rouge] What?

06:43.202 --> 06:45.371
[Mallah] Look
on the bright side.

06:45.438 --> 06:48.941
I've spent the better part
of an evening debating
whether or not to toss you over

06:49.041 --> 06:50.643
and you're still alive.

06:50.743 --> 06:52.779
Well, you best get on with it
because when I get out of these

06:52.879 --> 06:56.249
I am going to rip you apart.
I will have your hand
for an ashtray.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.652
We had it good here.

06:59.752 --> 07:02.989
-[grunts]
-But you have ruined everything

07:03.089 --> 07:05.124
Now The Brain
has his new body

07:05.224 --> 07:08.995
and the cycle of conquest
will begin anew.

07:09.095 --> 07:12.799
I realize I must put
this business of "Evil"

07:12.899 --> 07:15.401
behind me and move on.

07:15.468 --> 07:17.904
And so, I thank you,

07:17.970 --> 07:20.640
for being the catalyst
for my change.

07:20.740 --> 07:24.610
Well, you could
thank me by getting me
off this fucking gurney!

07:24.677 --> 07:28.514
[Mallah] You are every bit
as cunning and devious
as The Brain.

07:28.614 --> 07:31.184
Cut from the same awful cloth.

07:31.284 --> 07:34.320
I have no doubt
you'll figure it out.

07:34.420 --> 07:35.488
Mallah!

07:35.588 --> 07:39.192
Uh, you can't just leave me.

07:39.292 --> 07:43.996
You fucking son
of a simian whore!

07:44.096 --> 07:45.798
[Madame Rouge grunts]

07:45.865 --> 07:49.202
[echoing] Fuck!

07:49.302 --> 07:51.337
[sneezes] Shit.

07:57.810 --> 07:59.779
[jar tumbling]

07:59.846 --> 08:01.848
Oh shit!
[glass breaking]

08:14.460 --> 08:20.132
Look, I don't know
what you have in mind,
but I'm not ready for "this".

08:21.534 --> 08:24.203
We heard your distress.

08:24.303 --> 08:26.539
And it was high time
we find you anyway

08:29.408 --> 08:31.377
Hey, Hammerhead?

08:32.645 --> 08:34.213
Oh, you're gonna eyefuck me?

08:35.047 --> 08:36.148
Hey. You bag of shit!

08:36.215 --> 08:37.884
-Jane!
-Jane!

08:38.584 --> 08:39.552
Wait up!

08:40.853 --> 08:42.755
[exclaiming in pain]

08:44.724 --> 08:47.426
God damn!
What the hell is that thing?

08:48.661 --> 08:50.997
[Larry grunting]
It's trying to kill me!

08:54.834 --> 08:58.271
[Larry] It hates me.
It fucking hates me.

08:58.371 --> 08:59.605
Keeg doesn't hate you.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.742
[Larry] You can talk
to this thing?

09:02.842 --> 09:04.110
Keeg?

09:04.210 --> 09:06.078
[Mama Pentecost] I am fluent
in most languages.

09:06.178 --> 09:08.014
[Secretary] Including
light and color.

09:14.287 --> 09:16.522
He needs to merge with you.

09:16.589 --> 09:19.559
[Larry] That's not
gonna happen.
That's not who I am.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.428
[Larry] Not anymore.

09:22.528 --> 09:25.431
Then he will die. Soon.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.939
[Jane] I hope
you assholes are happy.

09:33.039 --> 09:34.807
The Girl is fucked
because of you.

09:34.907 --> 09:38.144
The Girl made it
plain as day she doesn't
want us around anymore.

09:38.244 --> 09:42.214
So, field trip's over.
We need to get everyone
out of here now.

09:42.281 --> 09:44.550
Dr. Harrison says
we are safer in The Fog.

09:44.617 --> 09:48.154
And when exactly did you become
Dr. Harrison's little bitch?

09:48.254 --> 09:51.557
We only exist
because of The Girl.

09:56.295 --> 09:57.263
What?

09:57.330 --> 09:58.898
There's something
you need to see.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.805
[upbeat music playing]

10:09.342 --> 10:10.776
[Glenna] Ooh!

10:17.483 --> 10:18.918
[The Brain] Ladies!

10:24.290 --> 10:27.293
Gary, you dog!

10:27.360 --> 10:28.995
[chuckles]

10:31.530 --> 10:34.133
<i>It's a good day</i>
<i>to be The Brain.</i>

10:49.115 --> 10:51.617
[Madame Rouge as robot]
You going somewhere,
you little shit?

10:51.684 --> 10:53.786
[The Brain]
Holy Mother of God!

10:59.992 --> 11:01.861
[Madame Rouge screaming]

11:03.663 --> 11:07.400
[Cliff exhales]
Where am I? I feel weird.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.736
Yeah, well, you're
a giant robot now

11:10.836 --> 11:13.305
and we're about to exact
revenge on the little shit

11:13.372 --> 11:15.708
that stole your body
and tried to kill us.

11:15.808 --> 11:18.678
Congratulations
and you're welcome!

11:21.047 --> 11:25.051
[The Brain] This isn't fair.
I don't deserve this.
I'm The Brain--

11:28.187 --> 11:30.923
You're what? Dog shit
on the bottom of my shoe?

11:31.023 --> 11:36.028
[Cliff] Uh, question. Was that
the sound of my one and only
body being pancaked?

11:36.095 --> 11:37.763
Yeah, it was phenomenal.

11:37.863 --> 11:42.034
Next stop? Doom Manor
and Rita fucking Farr.

11:42.101 --> 11:44.203
[levers clinking]

11:44.270 --> 11:47.173
[Cliff] Remember when
we all thought you were
an Ottoman?

12:04.724 --> 12:05.691
Oh, my God!

12:07.626 --> 12:08.761
Are they all sick?

12:12.298 --> 12:13.299
[Pretty Polly] Jane!

12:16.202 --> 12:18.938
[Pretty Polly] I'm sorry.

12:20.639 --> 12:22.074
[sobbing] I was scared.

12:23.409 --> 12:25.444
I didn't want to be alone.

12:26.545 --> 12:27.913
It's going to be okay.

12:30.716 --> 12:31.751
We'll fix this.

12:53.239 --> 12:57.910
Now is not the time
for you to burst in
and rile everyone up.

12:57.977 --> 13:00.146
-Something's happened
to The Girl.
-I heard.

13:00.246 --> 13:01.914
Good thing we got out
when we did.

13:01.981 --> 13:04.917
The Underground crumbled
and collapsed.

13:04.984 --> 13:07.920
Just like everyone in here.
It's connected.

13:07.987 --> 13:11.290
-That's certainly a theory.
-Cut the shit.

13:11.357 --> 13:14.527
What's it going to take for you
to come back and get the others
to go with you?

13:34.880 --> 13:39.385
You're angry. I get it.
But can't you just leave me
out of your shit?

13:39.485 --> 13:43.189
Sorry. This thing
runs on brain power.
Even the dimmest of bulbs.

13:43.289 --> 13:44.723
So you're shit out of luck.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.126
Come on. I've known you
for a couple of days.

13:47.193 --> 13:52.531
But that's been long enough
to know you're not really
all the way, next level "evil."

13:52.631 --> 13:55.201
Yeah, well,
I am who I am.

13:55.301 --> 13:59.839
Bull. Fucking. Shit.
There's always
a chance to change.

13:59.905 --> 14:03.409
Take me for example.
I'm every bit the dickhead
you are.

14:03.509 --> 14:07.413
But back in that pickle jar,
with my brain cut off
from all sensation,

14:07.513 --> 14:10.416
I had a revelation
or whatever.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.586
I'm going to do
everything I can,
work as hard as possible,

14:13.686 --> 14:19.058
to try and change myself.
And if I can do it,
I know you can too.

14:19.158 --> 14:21.360
So stop this thing now.

14:24.196 --> 14:27.333
Stop!

14:28.000 --> 14:28.834
Stop!

14:35.007 --> 14:35.908
Cliff?

14:36.542 --> 14:38.077
What did you do?

14:38.177 --> 14:39.445
Um...

14:40.112 --> 14:41.280
Go!

14:44.583 --> 14:47.786
[Cliff laughs]

14:47.887 --> 14:49.922
Check it out, Shitbird.

14:50.022 --> 14:52.057
Look who's in control now!

14:52.124 --> 14:54.093
[Cliff laughs]

14:54.193 --> 14:55.094
Cliff.

14:56.395 --> 14:58.063
Change it back.

14:58.130 --> 15:01.267
What? You'll kill me?
Go ahead. I'm already
fucking dying.

15:15.981 --> 15:16.882
Wait.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.118
What are you doing?

15:21.320 --> 15:23.589
Not to say every moment
is a teachable moment.

15:23.656 --> 15:29.495
But let's pause
and celebrate the fact
that you didn't murder me.

15:29.595 --> 15:34.233
Which means there's
a non-fuckwad person
deep in there.

15:38.404 --> 15:42.841
Hello?

15:42.942 --> 15:47.246
Fuck. What do I do now?
I'm trapped in a robot body.

15:47.313 --> 15:50.749
Wait. I'm always trapped
in a robot body.

15:50.816 --> 15:52.284
Reel it in, man.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.821
[yawns]

15:57.856 --> 15:59.858
[Vic] He's not looking
too good.

15:59.959 --> 16:02.761
In other words, time to shit
or get off the pot.

16:02.828 --> 16:04.930
Oh, I'm so sorry.

16:04.997 --> 16:08.968
Am I being too contemplative
how I just parted ways with
the previous alien creature

16:09.034 --> 16:13.372
who made me his home
for 60 absolutely
shitty years?

16:13.472 --> 16:14.606
Look, I get it.

16:16.475 --> 16:19.445
-My uncle has
a Golden Retriever named Bo.
-[Larry sighs]

16:19.511 --> 16:21.880
I loved playing with Bo
every time I'd visit.

16:21.981 --> 16:26.151
But as I got older,
Bo always stayed
fit as a fiddle.

16:26.218 --> 16:28.787
Then, at a certain point
I finally realized it.

16:28.854 --> 16:33.792
The Bo I was playing with
at 14 was not the same Bo that
I played with when I was eight.

16:33.859 --> 16:36.028
Every time Bo gets old
and he dies

16:36.128 --> 16:39.631
my uncle couldn't
handle the pain,
so he gets another Bo.

16:41.567 --> 16:44.903
-Let Keeg be your Bo.
-[sighs] Oh, God.

16:45.004 --> 16:47.072
That's kind of
fucked up, right?

16:47.172 --> 16:48.974
To keep naming it Bo.

16:49.041 --> 16:52.244
Yeah, it's also a gross
misrepresentation
of what I'm going through.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.647
[Larry sighs]

16:55.714 --> 17:00.686
Look, until this moment,
every major event in my life
was forced on me.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.755
Society forced me
into my marriage.

17:02.855 --> 17:06.759
The Chief pulled the strings
to have me cross paths
with the Negative Spirit.

17:06.859 --> 17:10.362
But if I let him in,
it will be my choice.

17:10.429 --> 17:16.402
And if it goes sideways,
which it always does,
then I'm the only one to blame.

17:19.338 --> 17:24.009
[chuckles] Maybe I should've
just left him in the woods.
To the elements.

17:24.076 --> 17:27.279
All I've really done
is just drawn
this experience out.

17:27.379 --> 17:28.847
Hey.

17:28.914 --> 17:30.883
Forget who you were
and the choices
you didn't make.

17:32.251 --> 17:34.753
You chose not to leave
Keeg in the woods

17:34.853 --> 17:38.957
and you're not about to
abandon him here now because
that's not the person you are.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.727
Do you remember
the conversation that you
had with your subconscious

17:41.794 --> 17:43.228
during the Flagellation?

17:43.295 --> 17:47.066
You told yourself that
you needed to let love in.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.536
This is your chance.

17:50.602 --> 17:52.704
The Spirit was closer to you
than anyone else.

17:53.539 --> 17:54.807
It chose you.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.443
Let it in.

18:10.823 --> 18:11.757
Cliff.

18:14.259 --> 18:15.661
What did they do to you?

18:16.395 --> 18:17.596
Take a guess.

18:19.965 --> 18:21.333
You're The Brain.

18:21.433 --> 18:25.971
And you're Rita Farr.
Fucking Garguax.

19:22.461 --> 19:25.364
[music playing on record]

19:57.229 --> 19:59.665
Love me.

20:00.832 --> 20:01.833
Love me.

20:26.959 --> 20:28.026
You're new.

20:53.452 --> 20:57.389
Rita, you clever
pain in the ass.

[Shipley]<i> Madame Rouge</i>

21:08.300 --> 21:10.502
<i>But then the question</i>
<i>came to her.</i>

21:10.602 --> 21:13.438
<i>Burrow to where</i>

21:13.505 --> 21:16.675
Anywhere but here.
Any time but now.

21:16.775 --> 21:20.178
I need to stop myself from ever
working with The Brotherhood.

21:22.781 --> 21:26.084
Wait. What am I thinking?
I need to go back farther.
I can...

21:26.151 --> 21:28.787
stop myself
and save the others.

21:28.854 --> 21:30.455
[gasps softly]

21:30.522 --> 21:32.357
I can save Malcolm.

21:32.457 --> 21:35.427

21:38.297 --> 21:40.465
No. Further.
Before I was me.

21:40.532 --> 21:43.702
Before Rouge.
Before Laura De Mille.

21:43.802 --> 21:45.937
<i>But then,</i>
<i>she had to ask herself,</i>

21:46.004 --> 21:49.174
<i>who was Madame Rouge before</i>
<i>she was Laura De Mille?</i>

21:49.274 --> 21:53.278
I'm not sure,
but not this.

21:54.446 --> 21:56.315
I just want to start over.

21:56.381 --> 21:59.551
<i>She mused. Not yet aware</i>

22:01.953 --> 22:05.991

22:06.058 --> 22:07.859
<i>What has happened</i>

22:07.959 --> 22:11.196
What do you mean?
How do I make things
right then?

22:11.296 --> 22:13.231
How do I make
myself right? I...

22:13.332 --> 22:17.202
I need to change.
Enough with the "where"
and the "when"!

22:17.302 --> 22:20.405
I just need
some fucking answers!

22:20.505 --> 22:24.676
Why am I talking to
another fucking robot?

22:24.743 --> 22:28.714
<i>So, where and when</i>
<i>would you like to go?</i>

22:33.919 --> 22:37.389
Kay needs us.
And I need you
to make that happen.

22:37.489 --> 22:39.391
The others respect you.
They listen to you.

22:39.491 --> 22:42.694
Why would we give up our
freedom? We can go anywhere
The Fog goes.

22:42.761 --> 22:45.230
I could just have The Fog
give you all the boot.

22:45.330 --> 22:50.535
-She likes me.
-But she'll do whatever I say,
if need be.

22:50.602 --> 22:55.340
I want you to ask yourself,
If the roles were reversed

22:55.407 --> 22:58.210
and we were on
the other side of the rocks,

22:58.276 --> 22:59.945
do you think that girl
would dig us out?

23:00.045 --> 23:02.781
I know Kay
well enough to know
that she would never let

23:02.881 --> 23:04.282
any of us crumble away
to nothing,

23:04.383 --> 23:06.351
which is what happens
as long as we stay here.

23:06.418 --> 23:08.687
Do you realize
what you're asking us
to give up?

23:08.754 --> 23:12.457
We've only just begun
to embrace our freedom.

23:16.561 --> 23:17.763
Holy shit.

23:19.965 --> 23:21.933
You don't care
about freedom.

23:22.033 --> 23:24.102
What you love
is control.

23:24.202 --> 23:26.905
You'd rather die,
and kill all of us,
than give that up.

23:29.541 --> 23:31.610
Or maybe we can do
something about that.

23:33.478 --> 23:34.479
Go on.

23:36.114 --> 23:37.649
[groans in pains]

-I'm trying.

23:45.323 --> 23:46.792
Something's not right.

23:46.892 --> 23:48.593

at your bandages.

23:48.660 --> 23:51.163
They're designed

23:51.263 --> 23:52.831
Maybe they're too
strong for him.

23:55.434 --> 23:58.437
-Let me carry him.
-What? No.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.506
Are you insane?

24:01.606 --> 24:04.109
Just until we get back
to the house and we can
use your room.

24:04.176 --> 24:06.678
-It's radiation proof.
-Vic. It could kill you.

24:06.778 --> 24:09.114
That's my choice.
Rita was right.

24:11.149 --> 24:13.351
I was afraid to go after
the Brotherhood of Evil

24:13.452 --> 24:16.188
because I don't have
my powers anymore.

24:16.288 --> 24:19.191
I let Cliff down.
I'm not about to make
the same mistake with you.

24:23.962 --> 24:24.930
All right.

24:31.470 --> 24:34.372
Now, we don't
know each other,
but I'm here to help.

-[Cliff] Hey, Clara.
-What the fuck?

24:55.994 --> 24:58.497
-So, your dad popped by.
-[Cliff] Hi, honeybun.

24:58.997 --> 24:59.898
It's me!

25:00.832 --> 25:03.401
Dad? What the fuck happened?

25:03.502 --> 25:07.072
-Are you in that thing?
-I guess I kind of am
this thing now.

25:07.172 --> 25:12.577
I assumed you'd be worried
and I wanted to swing by
and let you know that I'm okay.

25:12.677 --> 25:14.980
I even have central A/C!

25:15.046 --> 25:18.350
And I know this is, like,
my ninth second chance,

25:18.416 --> 25:21.052
but I came because I know

25:21.152 --> 25:24.356
you want me to change,
and I'm ready to.

25:24.422 --> 25:26.224
[Clara] Yeah,
I didn't mean like this.

25:26.324 --> 25:28.426
[Cliff] I know you meant
"real" change.

25:28.527 --> 25:32.397
I thought I'd start
with the good old-fashioned
"apologies-in-advance" tour.

25:32.497 --> 25:34.165
And, you had to be
the first stop.

25:34.232 --> 25:37.035
Okay, You don't need to worry
about the credit card stuff.

25:37.102 --> 25:39.037
We just need
to get your meds checked.

25:39.104 --> 25:40.338
-[baby cooing]
-[Cliff] This is beyond that.

25:40.405 --> 25:41.873
I've been a shitty dad.

25:41.940 --> 25:45.944
Way before Parkinson's,
before becoming dumb robot.

25:46.044 --> 25:49.614
I pulled shit when you were
too young to remember,

25:49.714 --> 25:52.117
but I can't forget. I guess...

25:52.217 --> 25:56.354
I always wanted to be special.
You know? I wanted to be
"the man."

25:56.421 --> 26:03.094
I was so focused
on being great,
I forgot to be good.

26:03.194 --> 26:06.064
-It's okay, Dad.
-No, it's really not.

26:06.131 --> 26:10.302
But I know now,
the only people
I need to be special to

26:10.402 --> 26:11.870
are you and Rory.

-[Rory crying]
-[sirens approaching]

26:15.373 --> 26:17.275

26:17.375 --> 26:18.810
I need you to get healthy.

26:18.910 --> 26:22.080
I can do that, too!
You'll see!

26:22.147 --> 26:23.481
But I should go.

26:23.582 --> 26:26.418

-I have left behind anything
connecting me to you.

-[Rita] Mmm-hmm.
-A lifetime as friends
and partners,

26:59.618 --> 27:02.687
leader and acolyte,
and he skidoos on me.

27:02.787 --> 27:04.823
I taught him
everything he knows,

27:04.923 --> 27:07.626
and all I have to show for it
is a bandolier

ray gun,

and my Alanis Morissette CD

from our car years ago.

27:19.971 --> 27:24.042

I had the world
by the short hairs.

27:24.976 --> 27:27.345
-And now--
-No legs.

27:27.445 --> 27:29.481
Life's a bitch, right?

27:29.547 --> 27:33.051
The good news is
that I still have
the blueprints for this body.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.120
-You do?
-I can rebuild.

27:35.186 --> 27:37.789
But I need some help.

27:39.157 --> 27:40.525
-Oh?
-Come on.

27:40.625 --> 27:44.129
It's obvious you've been
dancing around the darkness.

27:44.195 --> 27:46.665
How 'bout this?
You help me rebuild,

27:46.731 --> 27:49.034
and I'll help you kill Rouge.

27:49.134 --> 27:52.203
And then,
you will truly know evil.

27:55.006 --> 27:58.176
You can... guarantee this?

27:58.243 --> 28:00.078
That I'll get Rouge?

28:00.178 --> 28:04.249
Miss Farr, if you team with me,
We could kill Madame Rouge,

28:04.349 --> 28:09.087

and Professor fucking Plum

There we go.
That's a good girl.

28:36.581 --> 28:40.885
[Rita] I suppose
Rouge and I are alike.

28:40.952 --> 28:44.189
However, we are different
in one regard.

28:44.255 --> 28:46.191
And what's that?

28:46.257 --> 28:49.227
Rouge is driven by one thing.

28:49.794 --> 28:50.962
Power.

28:51.062 --> 28:52.764
She couldn't get enough.

28:54.232 --> 28:57.135

Or were you trying
to draw me in?

might get you to come

to come back down?

more than anything else?

Are you fuck...
Is she primary now?

Can you even give that away?

33:34.345 --> 33:35.747
What's Kay
going to say about this?

33:35.847 --> 33:38.983
I'll worry about that
once I know she's safe.

'Cause, I know I know you.

-For me.

You are a terrible person,
but trying to change.

who despise you.

-He's indisposed.
He just had a baby.

-[Cliff] Hey, guys! It's me.
-[Vic] Cliff?

35:40.104 --> 35:42.373
Oh. "A drug addled android."

35:42.473 --> 35:45.176
[Cliff] Please don't hate me.
I've come to make amends.

35:45.276 --> 35:48.179
I even brought back
most of the shit
I stole from you.

Does that mean things
are all good with us?

how to stop this thing.

from Rouge, but I'm still
figuring it out.

36:22.413 --> 36:26.384
And I fucked up.
And I have Parkinson's.
So, there's that.

36:26.484 --> 36:27.685
Why can't you stop yourself?

36:27.752 --> 36:29.820
I thought you were taking
fistfuls of meds.

36:29.887 --> 36:32.256
Well, that? That went
out the window
when I got kidnapped.

36:32.356 --> 36:34.692
and shoved
into a fucking transformer.

36:35.660 --> 36:37.562
Can you transform?

36:37.662 --> 36:38.729
[Cliff sighs] No.

36:38.829 --> 36:40.198

anything heroic, or?

36:47.872 --> 36:49.207
Got it.

You're a useless person.

[Vic] Larry?

36:58.416 --> 37:01.686
If you're in there,
we need you to help stop Cliff.

37:01.752 --> 37:03.354

Just Flit outta here
and save yourself.

I am not leaving you.

37:48.099 --> 37:49.900
[Jane] Okay, okay.

37:49.967 --> 37:54.739
One of these buttons
or switches should shut
your sorry ass down.

38:06.250 --> 38:07.818

38:07.918 --> 38:10.688
Uh, pretty sure
you just pulled
the self-destruct lever.

That was a very
important detail!

remember me, do you?

with Malcolm

38:54.632 --> 38:56.200

I'm sorry, Rita.

to kill me.

-maybe take out a mini mall.

-Yeah. Silent but deadly.
-[both laughing]

39:46.584 --> 39:48.786
[Cliff] Well, I just wanted
to say thank you.

39:48.886 --> 39:51.589
for always calling me
on my bullshit,

39:51.689 --> 39:54.191
and for always forgiving me
for my bullshit.

40:04.201 --> 40:08.038
Yeah, well, you're pathetic.

40:08.105 --> 40:09.640

easy to forgive.

40:12.576 --> 40:14.078
[Cliff] That's it?
That's all I get?

another minute
to say goodbye.

42:10.895 --> 42:12.596
[Rita] Or maybe
there was no damage

Why are we?

Maybe we are weapons,

but a weapon is only a tool
as dangerous as
the hand that wields it.

What if we choose
to become weapons for good?
