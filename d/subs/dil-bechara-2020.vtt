01:31.500 --> 01:33.959
Once upon a time
there were a Prince and a Princess...

01:34.209 --> 01:37.750
Stories my grandma told me
as a young girl often started like that.

01:38.334 --> 01:41.000
Everyone loves such fairy tales.

01:41.417 --> 01:47.125
We crave stories of love,
romance and all its madness.

01:47.209 --> 01:48.792
Like in the films.

01:49.292 --> 01:52.917
The handsome prince,
the beautiful princess...

01:53.125 --> 01:54.875
dance to a romantic ballad.

01:55.459 --> 01:59.042
The first lock of eyes.
Then, lovelorn looks.

01:59.417 --> 02:03.250
And love songs bursting
with false promises.

02:03.917 --> 02:05.750
And finally... a happy ending.

02:06.625 --> 02:08.667
But, that's far from the truth.

02:09.042 --> 02:11.084
Grandma's story was true.

02:11.250 --> 02:13.417
Once upon a time
there were a Prince and a Princess...

02:13.750 --> 02:15.959
They both died.
The End.

02:21.000 --> 02:24.084
Gayatri and I
had an arranged marriage.

02:24.334 --> 02:25.792
It wasn't a love match.

02:26.250 --> 02:32.042
Last year we celebrated
our 50th wedding anniversary.

02:32.459 --> 02:35.584
And in these 50 years,
we fell deeply in love.

02:36.125 --> 02:37.584
We had a deal.

02:38.750 --> 02:42.459
She'd bring me bed tea
every morning.

02:42.625 --> 02:45.542
And every night,
I would turn off the lights

02:45.625 --> 02:47.917
and tuck into bed with her.

02:48.250 --> 02:49.250
But...

02:51.459 --> 02:53.500
she left before me.

02:55.542 --> 02:57.000
Accept our prayers.

02:58.834 --> 03:00.667
On behalf of Thy servant.

03:01.834 --> 03:03.250
-Hello.
-Hello, Kizie.

03:03.334 --> 03:04.750
-Are you feeling unwell?
-I can't talk right now.

03:04.834 --> 03:06.125
-No!
-Why are you whispering?

03:06.209 --> 03:08.500
-Are you breathless?
-I'm fine, Ma.

03:08.584 --> 03:11.709
What are you saying, Kizie?
Is the cylinder empty?

03:11.792 --> 03:15.209
Mom, please take a chill pill.
I'm in a movie.

03:15.375 --> 03:16.709
-Amen.
-Hello, hello.

03:16.792 --> 03:17.584
Kizie?

03:17.667 --> 03:18.667
Bye, Ma.

03:31.209 --> 03:33.292
They're all strangers for me.

03:33.584 --> 03:35.125
As I, to them.

03:35.292 --> 03:38.000
But, I don't know why...
when I hug them,

03:38.459 --> 03:40.917
I feel that I'm able
to take away some of their loneliness.

03:41.709 --> 03:44.667
Or is it mine?

03:55.917 --> 03:59.459
This angry young woman is my mother.

04:12.042 --> 04:14.917
Durgesh, what time
did Kizie come here?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.417
An hour back.

04:16.500 --> 04:17.667
Don't lie!

04:18.084 --> 04:20.625
-I came 15 minutes ago from the cinema.
-Really?

04:20.792 --> 04:23.042
-After watching a film.
-Which one?

04:23.375 --> 04:25.250
-The new one...
-New one?

04:25.417 --> 04:27.959
It stars David Dhawan's son.

04:28.042 --> 04:29.125
The one about dance.

04:30.167 --> 04:31.875
Let's Dance Tonight, right?

04:32.042 --> 04:33.917
That's right!

04:34.125 --> 04:36.417
There's no film with that name.

04:36.584 --> 04:37.667
Concentrate on your job.

04:37.750 --> 04:39.000
No need to eavesdrop
on our conversation.

04:39.125 --> 04:40.584
He's talking nonsense.

04:41.334 --> 04:42.709
Is he?

04:46.000 --> 04:48.500
Ma, me and the rickshaw driver, Durgesh.

04:48.875 --> 04:50.292
The same little lanes.

04:50.375 --> 04:51.917
The same trivial talk.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.917
My small world in Jamshedpur.

04:55.834 --> 04:57.417
My name's Kizie Basu.

04:57.625 --> 04:59.042
Don't ask why.

04:59.209 --> 05:00.834
Welcome to my boring world.

05:01.042 --> 05:05.542
Day and night...
medicines all the time!

05:11.959 --> 05:13.084
Dad.

05:13.750 --> 05:16.292
Kizie, come here.
Sit with me.

05:16.750 --> 05:21.292
I start my day watching
National Geographic with dad.

05:23.667 --> 05:27.834
I think he likes animals
more than humans.

05:30.250 --> 05:32.209
Kizie, eat this.

05:32.417 --> 05:33.542
Ma, what are you doing?

05:33.625 --> 05:36.792
Open your mouth.
Why are you resisting them?

05:36.875 --> 05:39.125
This is your favourite cheesecake.

05:39.209 --> 05:40.834
I hate cheesecake.

05:41.209 --> 05:43.000
How can you hate cheesecake, Kizie?

05:43.459 --> 05:44.750
Aren't you a true Bengali?

05:44.792 --> 05:47.917
Mom thinks just like E.T. and Elliot
had a critical bond,

05:48.000 --> 05:49.792
so do Bengali's and their cheesecake.

05:49.875 --> 05:54.042
I'm sure diabetes will kill me
before my cancer does.

05:54.584 --> 05:55.417
Yes.

05:55.500 --> 05:58.084
I have cancer. Thyroid cancer.

05:58.209 --> 06:00.792
And this cylinder
is my best friend, Pushpinder.

06:00.959 --> 06:02.917
The oxygen in it is my boon.

06:03.292 --> 06:05.292
And its weight is my bane.

06:05.375 --> 06:08.417
But, Dr Jha gives me
the deepest blues.

06:11.542 --> 06:14.125
You're a brave girl.

06:14.167 --> 06:17.709
And so long as you stay strong,
there's hope.

06:18.084 --> 06:19.084
Nonsense!

06:19.459 --> 06:20.875
I don't want to be strong.

06:20.959 --> 06:22.584
I just want to be normal.

06:23.125 --> 06:27.334
I want to laugh like a normal girl.
Cry for normal reasons.

06:27.584 --> 06:31.500
I want to gossip about the girl
wearing the gaudy pink skirt.

06:31.584 --> 06:36.417
And I want to crush on
the most handsome boy in college.

06:37.750 --> 06:40.584
But even in my dreams
instead of a guitar,

06:40.667 --> 06:43.125
my hero stands
with an oxygen cylinder.

06:43.917 --> 06:46.000
I think I'm losing it.

07:09.584 --> 07:12.000
I only have one wish.

07:12.250 --> 07:14.542
I want to meet Abhimanyu Veer.

07:14.917 --> 07:16.959
He's my favourite musician.

07:17.917 --> 07:20.125
But, surely every wish
doesn't get fulfilled.

07:20.792 --> 07:23.917
Anyway, enough for today.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.000
Shall we meet tomorrow?

07:26.167 --> 07:28.209
Another boring day
in the life of Kizie Basu.

08:10.292 --> 08:11.292
Hey, Manny.

08:12.542 --> 08:13.500
Manny!

08:15.250 --> 08:18.000
Will this audience know
superstar Rajnikanth's song?

08:18.042 --> 08:20.542
JP, this is just to show our love for him.

08:26.875 --> 08:28.875
-The real show will be in Hindi.
-How?

08:28.959 --> 08:31.334
Shall I show you? The heart...

08:42.084 --> 08:44.292
JP, saw my killer charm?

08:44.459 --> 08:48.875
With a chiselled face like yours,
one look is enough.

08:49.084 --> 08:52.292
My baby boy looks just don't cut it.

08:53.209 --> 08:54.334
Let's go, now.

09:08.167 --> 09:09.584
What a lovely performance.

09:09.667 --> 09:11.667
A big round of applause
for Brij Bhushan.

09:11.750 --> 09:12.834
Louder!

09:13.042 --> 09:15.250
Hey, don't waste plastic.

09:16.084 --> 09:18.292
Show some respect for the talent.

09:19.334 --> 09:20.875
And the next performer is...

09:21.209 --> 09:23.500
Kishan Bajaj with his magic tricks!

09:23.625 --> 09:27.292
Kishan... yay!

09:27.375 --> 09:29.375
Now, now. Come back another time.

09:32.125 --> 09:33.875
Hey Manny, you're back?

09:33.959 --> 09:36.209
Did the Delhi folks boo you away?

09:38.250 --> 09:41.667
All your batch mates are now MBAs.
And you're still lurking here?

09:43.042 --> 09:44.209
Quiet!

09:44.417 --> 09:48.584
Manny, get off the stage. Now!

09:49.000 --> 09:50.250
Or else I'll call your father.

09:50.334 --> 09:52.959
7-6-6...
He would love it, ma'am.

09:55.709 --> 09:57.709
Lights! Music!

13:03.459 --> 13:05.625
Immanuel Rajkumar Junior.

13:08.875 --> 13:10.250
Kizie Basu.

13:10.625 --> 13:12.167
Of course, I'll kiss you, Basu.

13:12.334 --> 13:13.084
Ha-ha-ha!

13:13.792 --> 13:15.250
I've never heard the joke before.

13:15.500 --> 13:16.959
It wasn't a joke.

13:17.459 --> 13:20.250
Who named you, Kissie?

13:20.625 --> 13:21.959
-It's not Kissie.
-Then?

13:22.125 --> 13:23.417
-It's Kizie.
-Oh.

13:23.500 --> 13:24.334
-Z.
-Yeah.

13:24.375 --> 13:25.709
-It's a Zambian name.
-Oh...

13:26.292 --> 13:28.417
And which planet is that?

13:29.125 --> 13:31.167
-Zambia's in Africa.
-Oh, okay.

13:31.209 --> 13:32.250
I was born there.

13:33.709 --> 13:35.709
Then it's not your fault.

13:36.709 --> 13:37.875
I was only...

13:38.417 --> 13:41.292
What does Kizie mean?
I'm just curious.

13:43.959 --> 13:46.250
One that always stays with you.

13:46.500 --> 13:47.792
You mean... a clingy latch.

13:47.959 --> 13:48.959
Shut up.

13:50.167 --> 13:51.459
You must be a latch.

13:52.084 --> 13:53.959
Me? Of course...
Obviously.

13:56.209 --> 13:58.084
Ah!

14:00.417 --> 14:02.459
My bike's working now.
Come, I'll drop you.

14:02.792 --> 14:03.584
Thanks.

14:03.750 --> 14:04.459
Why?

14:04.500 --> 14:05.792
-I'll manage.
-Why?

14:05.959 --> 14:07.292
You don't look safe.

14:08.625 --> 14:10.459
You look like a serial killer.

14:11.250 --> 14:13.917
I'm a serial killer
and you a serial kisser.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.125
What a pair!
No?

14:16.292 --> 14:17.292
Kizie.

14:20.917 --> 14:22.042
Hi, Mrs Basu.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.459
I'm Kizie's new boy.

14:26.042 --> 14:26.959
Friend.

14:27.042 --> 14:27.959
Boy friend.

14:38.792 --> 14:42.417
Sometimes I feel
like a reality show contestant.

14:42.792 --> 14:46.334
I'm about to be eliminated
but someone votes for me

14:46.834 --> 14:48.750
and I manage to stay on
for another week.

14:49.084 --> 14:53.959
And when the wild card entry appears,
there's mayhem.

14:54.334 --> 14:58.042
Immanuel Rajkumar Junior
reminds me of that wild card entry.

14:58.667 --> 15:00.584
Irritating. Arrogant.

15:00.792 --> 15:02.834
Narcissistic to the core.

15:03.667 --> 15:05.584
But, I don't want him
to get eliminated.

15:06.000 --> 15:08.334
I'm tempted to watch him perform
for another week.

15:12.917 --> 15:14.125
So...

15:14.584 --> 15:15.542
Hey, Manny.

15:15.584 --> 15:18.042
Good to see so many of you here
at this session.

15:18.667 --> 15:20.792
Who wants to start? Anyone?

15:21.875 --> 15:23.292
Hi, everyone. I'm Omkar.

15:23.375 --> 15:25.459
21, Hodgkin's Lymphoma.

15:25.792 --> 15:29.125
I'm sleeping well this week.

15:29.375 --> 15:31.792
Dr Jha has said that
my reports are better.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.459
But, I miss my friends.

15:34.625 --> 15:37.000
Those lectures, picnics...

15:41.584 --> 15:43.375
Will you act in my film?

15:44.459 --> 15:45.334
What?

15:45.417 --> 15:48.792
JP and I are making a film.
Would you like to act in it?

15:49.500 --> 15:50.584
You're mad.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.292
Dr Jha's here.

15:53.375 --> 15:54.542
Keep the faith.

15:54.834 --> 15:56.792
He doesn't fit the bill.
It's a female role.

15:57.875 --> 16:00.584
Look, Immanuel Rajkumar Junior...

16:02.084 --> 16:04.125
You've learned my full name
so quickly.

16:04.375 --> 16:05.292
Naughty girl!

16:05.459 --> 16:07.542
Anyone else? JP?

16:08.042 --> 16:09.709
Ah yes, sir.

16:10.667 --> 16:12.542
What do you shoot all day?

16:12.625 --> 16:14.667
-Sir, we're making a film.
-Really?

16:14.750 --> 16:19.875
And we'll make such a great film
that everyone will appreciate it.

16:21.250 --> 16:22.167
Hello.

16:22.292 --> 16:24.834
My name is JP.
Jagdish Pandey.

16:26.209 --> 16:27.917
I have cancer of the eyes.

16:27.959 --> 16:31.584
Optic nerve glaucoma,
isn't it doctor?

16:32.167 --> 16:34.209
I've lost one eye.

16:34.625 --> 16:37.709
In two months I'm scheduled for surgery
and will lose the other one, too.

16:37.875 --> 16:41.417
I've always wanted to make
a super successful Bhojpuri film.

16:41.500 --> 16:44.084
Starring Ravi Kishen or Manoj Tiwari.

16:45.625 --> 16:47.417
But, that's not possible.

16:47.500 --> 16:50.042
But, my film is shaping up well.

16:50.209 --> 16:51.584
With Manny.

16:51.834 --> 16:53.792
Sir, it'll be an Oscar winner.

16:54.084 --> 16:55.667
-Really?
-Do you know who stars in it?

16:55.750 --> 16:57.584
-Who?
-Immanuel Rajkumar Junior!

16:58.959 --> 17:00.125
What's the film called?

17:00.334 --> 17:03.875
'Rajni Arrives, Dreams Revive'.

17:07.959 --> 17:10.917
Manny, would you
like to say something?

17:12.167 --> 17:13.167
Okay.

17:15.334 --> 17:17.459
Tell us, what are you scared of?

17:19.375 --> 17:21.292
I'm scared of absolutely nothing.

17:21.584 --> 17:23.209
Fine. Tell us something
about yourself.

17:23.417 --> 17:25.292
My name is Immanuel Rajkumar Junior.

17:25.459 --> 17:28.000
A few years ago,
I had a brush with osteosarcoma.

17:28.084 --> 17:31.250
And because of that
I lost this baby.

17:34.125 --> 17:37.125
But, I'm a fighter and I...
I fought well.

17:37.625 --> 17:40.500
And sir, I want to act
like Rajni sir.

17:40.875 --> 17:43.000
I want to beat up the bad guys.

17:43.084 --> 17:45.417
Save the girl.
I want to risk my life for her.

17:45.500 --> 17:48.250
I want to be a real-life hero.

17:48.334 --> 17:49.334
Applause!

17:52.209 --> 17:54.417
Does anybody else want to share?
Anybody else?

17:55.334 --> 17:56.500
Kizie Basu?

17:56.959 --> 17:58.292
This is a surprise.

17:58.625 --> 17:59.750
First time.

18:03.209 --> 18:04.792
Sir, I just want to say that

18:04.875 --> 18:07.334
you don't need to be popular
to be a hero.

18:08.375 --> 18:10.125
Even the boy-next-door
can be a hero.

18:30.167 --> 18:32.917
Why does my bike always conk off
in front of you?

18:35.334 --> 18:36.750
Are you really an alien?

18:40.167 --> 18:44.000
I love you... always, forever.

18:44.209 --> 18:45.792
-Always, forever?
-Yes!

18:46.000 --> 18:47.584
Always, forever?

18:47.834 --> 18:49.292
Always, forever.

18:49.500 --> 18:50.792
Always, forever?

18:51.000 --> 18:53.334
Always, forever.

18:53.750 --> 18:55.334
Always, forever?

18:55.542 --> 18:56.375
Always, forever.

18:56.542 --> 18:58.042
What's this 'always, forever' business?

18:58.542 --> 19:00.917
It's their 'always, forever' policy.

19:01.209 --> 19:03.500
Their hearts beat
only for each other.

19:03.667 --> 19:05.917
Always, forever.

19:06.625 --> 19:09.334
Do you always say
such irritating things?

19:09.875 --> 19:10.834
Always.

19:13.125 --> 19:14.459
Nothing is forever.

19:14.542 --> 19:15.584
Actually, you're right.

19:15.667 --> 19:18.250
I can't wait for you endlessly.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.084
Why don't you come?
I'll drop you.

19:20.917 --> 19:22.459
I'll save you some time.

19:23.709 --> 19:25.459
Trust me. Look at me.

19:27.375 --> 19:29.209
Come on. Trust me.

19:30.834 --> 19:31.667
Get in.

19:43.125 --> 19:44.292
-Kizie Basu.
-Yes?

19:44.792 --> 19:47.792
You shouldn't be riding
with a stranger on his bike.

19:49.084 --> 19:50.542
What if I were to kidnap you?

19:51.125 --> 19:52.167
Kidnap?

19:53.292 --> 19:55.084
And where would you take me?

19:56.500 --> 19:57.584
Shall I tell you?

20:09.625 --> 20:12.917
This is the favourite spot for both,
serial killers and kissers.

20:13.709 --> 20:14.709
Come.

20:42.584 --> 20:45.542
It's beautiful.

20:46.834 --> 20:48.042
Thank you.

20:48.459 --> 20:51.084
Not you. This place.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.084
Yeah, of course.

20:54.000 --> 21:00.000
But, at this very spot,
an ex told me the same thing.

21:00.084 --> 21:01.667
You're so beautiful.

21:02.834 --> 21:04.334
And what did you reply?

21:04.459 --> 21:05.917
"Thank you. I know."

21:08.167 --> 21:10.209
Do you get all your girlfriends here?

21:10.292 --> 21:11.209
No.

21:11.917 --> 21:13.709
Just the aliens.

21:14.125 --> 21:16.584
Ones with these small spaceships.

21:17.417 --> 21:19.625
The spaceship is called Pushpinder.

21:21.125 --> 21:23.167
Pushpinder! A Punjabi!

21:24.292 --> 21:26.125
Wassup, bro!

21:48.125 --> 21:49.500
-Listen to this.
-What is it?

21:49.584 --> 21:51.084
-My favourite song.
-Okay.

21:51.917 --> 21:52.792
Which film is it from?

21:52.875 --> 21:54.292
It's not from a film.

21:54.375 --> 21:56.584
It's from an album by Abhimanyu Veer.

21:57.375 --> 21:58.084
Great.

21:58.250 --> 21:59.292
'I'm Yours.'

22:00.292 --> 22:01.125
Oh!

22:06.459 --> 22:07.250
Yeah.

22:07.334 --> 22:09.292
-Did you like it?
-It's very boring.

22:10.209 --> 22:11.042
Sorry.

22:11.167 --> 22:12.125
Sorry.

22:13.792 --> 22:15.959
-Of course.
-What?

22:17.459 --> 22:18.959
Since it's not from a film.

22:19.042 --> 22:20.584
Hold on. I'm into popular music.

22:20.667 --> 22:22.250
I like all the chartbusters.

22:22.417 --> 22:24.000
'Saturday-Saturday.'

22:24.250 --> 22:26.584
'Girlfriend Gone Bad', 'Bad Guy.'

22:26.792 --> 22:28.417
Such rubbish!

22:28.792 --> 22:29.917
Oh, was it a flop album?

22:30.000 --> 22:32.250
It was a smash hit.
Many years ago.

22:32.417 --> 22:33.959
And for many years.

22:34.125 --> 22:37.084
If Honey Singh would've sung it,
it would still be a hit.

22:38.042 --> 22:39.167
My favourite.

22:43.625 --> 22:45.125
-Really?
-What?

22:45.334 --> 22:46.709
No... what?

22:47.125 --> 22:48.459
I did something?

22:49.084 --> 22:50.084
Nothing.

22:50.959 --> 22:54.292
Then why are you giving me
the 'angry girlfriend' look?

22:54.875 --> 22:59.875
Do you think you look cool
with the cigarette?

23:00.292 --> 23:02.584
Millions of people
are dying with cancer, Manny.

23:02.750 --> 23:04.917
And not being able to breathe
isn't easy.

23:05.084 --> 23:06.125
I don't smoke.

23:09.084 --> 23:11.209
Only a lit cigarette can kill.

23:11.542 --> 23:15.334
And I've taken away its power.

23:15.542 --> 23:17.292
So, it's just a metaphor.

23:19.334 --> 23:20.334
Whatever.

23:20.792 --> 23:21.875
It's not cool.

23:21.959 --> 23:23.000
Yes, of course.

23:24.375 --> 23:27.084
And I'm not your girlfriend.

23:27.459 --> 23:30.500
Like, not now or ever?

23:32.334 --> 23:33.334
Never ever!

23:34.625 --> 23:35.625
Liar!

23:39.000 --> 23:40.500
He's very arrogant.

23:43.875 --> 23:45.000
"Liar!"

23:48.542 --> 23:54.625
I will never meet him again.

23:57.167 --> 23:59.084
He sat between his parents

23:59.417 --> 24:01.542
and when I gave him a cup of tea

24:01.750 --> 24:03.792
my hands did not shake.

24:04.084 --> 24:05.334
But, his..

24:05.584 --> 24:09.667
He rattled the cup
right off the saucer into his lap.

24:10.209 --> 24:14.042
I see my family and friends
in these people sitting here.

24:15.125 --> 24:17.042
I can't bear to see their pain.

24:17.500 --> 24:22.792
I feel like giving them a tight hug,
to mend their broken lives.

24:24.125 --> 24:26.500
My life feels broken, too.

24:26.584 --> 24:27.792
Please mend it.

24:27.875 --> 24:31.584
One son and one daughter later
our lives were whole.

24:32.334 --> 24:34.750
Kenneth was utterly devoted
to his children.

24:35.375 --> 24:38.709
He loved his son
but he spoilt his little girl.

24:40.042 --> 24:42.167
-Who's the dead guy?
-Kenneth D'Costa.

24:42.250 --> 24:43.250
I see.

24:44.667 --> 24:47.250
-Was he Kizie's relative?
-Have you lost it?

24:51.459 --> 24:52.459
Yours?

24:58.750 --> 25:01.667
Are you guys here for free food?

25:02.000 --> 25:03.209
Food doesn't get served here.

25:03.292 --> 25:05.167
Will both of you
please shut up! Quiet.

25:05.667 --> 25:06.667
Sorry.

25:07.750 --> 25:10.250
You are both nuts.
Is this any place for romance?

25:10.334 --> 25:13.625
-We are doing no such thing.
-I am. Aren't you? Feel free to.

25:13.709 --> 25:16.209
I'm begging you.
Please shut up.

25:16.292 --> 25:18.292
I won't. Why should I?

25:18.459 --> 25:20.417
My name's Immanuel Rajkumar Junior.

25:20.584 --> 25:22.084
And I'm Jagdish Pandey.

25:22.250 --> 25:24.917
And I haven't worn underpants today.

25:25.000 --> 25:27.334
Ditto!
I haven't either.

25:27.417 --> 25:29.167
And I've never had sex!

25:29.250 --> 25:30.542
I...

25:33.709 --> 25:34.709
have...

25:40.917 --> 25:42.625
Never mind, Manny.

25:42.709 --> 25:43.834
You never told me?

25:43.917 --> 25:46.084
Let's talk later.
Let's go from here.

25:50.584 --> 25:51.875
Really sorry.

26:00.292 --> 26:02.500
Manny, you almost got us into trouble.

26:14.375 --> 26:16.084
Manny, left.

26:16.542 --> 26:18.167
-Is your house on the left?
-Yes.

26:18.250 --> 26:19.250
Of course.

26:22.084 --> 26:23.709
That's it. That's it.

26:27.917 --> 26:29.084
Thank you.

26:29.250 --> 26:30.334
Thank you.

26:32.542 --> 26:35.834
So, what have you decided?
Will you play the heroine?

26:36.542 --> 26:38.959
I might.
But, on one condition.

26:39.667 --> 26:42.000
You will listen to this first.

26:43.250 --> 26:44.500
Boring.

26:44.834 --> 26:46.209
Do you want a heroine?

26:47.417 --> 26:48.750
You don't have a choice.

26:49.167 --> 26:50.875
The film hasn't started
but the tantrums have begun.

26:50.917 --> 26:52.375
You're surely my heroine.

26:53.375 --> 26:55.625
-Pushpinder bro, take care of her.
-Bye!

26:55.959 --> 26:57.417
I'm yours...

26:57.500 --> 26:59.000
I'm yours...

26:59.084 --> 27:00.584
I'm yours...

27:01.250 --> 27:04.250
Manny, you're croaking.
You've ruined my sleep.

27:04.334 --> 27:05.709
I'm yours, my darling.

28:33.084 --> 28:35.375
Here, Manny, have some milk.

29:15.209 --> 29:17.542
-Stop it, JP.
-But, what did I do?

29:17.667 --> 29:18.584
I don't care.

29:18.709 --> 29:21.417
I have so many problems and you...

29:21.459 --> 29:24.084
-Not my problem. Just stop it.
-What did I do?

29:24.167 --> 29:26.625
-You loved me very much till yesterday.
-Now I don't!

29:26.709 --> 29:29.125
I'm going to lose my sight...

29:36.292 --> 29:37.584
How's the fish?

29:37.875 --> 29:38.875
What?

29:40.167 --> 29:42.584
Kizie, how's the fish?

29:43.167 --> 29:45.375
It's awesome, Ma.
Too sweet.

29:47.042 --> 29:48.000
Sweet?

29:51.167 --> 29:52.709
I'm sure it's that boy.

29:53.500 --> 29:55.459
At this age, it's always a boy.

29:55.792 --> 29:56.792
Manny?

30:12.584 --> 30:13.417
Hi.

30:13.500 --> 30:14.167
Manny!

30:14.250 --> 30:16.375
Are you looking for me?
I love your t-shirt.

30:16.459 --> 30:17.250
Thank you.

30:17.375 --> 30:19.250
But, what are you doing here?

30:19.584 --> 30:21.834
Kizie Basu, I heard your songs.

30:22.584 --> 30:24.917
-Manny, Ma and Dad are downstairs.
-What an album!

30:25.000 --> 30:26.834
-What amazing songs.
-Right?

30:26.875 --> 30:28.167
This Abhimanyu's deep.

30:28.459 --> 30:30.000
-He's so deep!
-But, tell me...

30:30.084 --> 30:31.209
I'm yours when?

30:33.250 --> 30:34.917
I mean, the song.
'I'm Yours'.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.959
What's after?
What happens 'When I'm yours'?

30:37.000 --> 30:38.542
He vanished.

30:38.667 --> 30:40.500
Abhimanyu Veer vanished into thin air.

30:40.584 --> 30:42.334
He never completed the song.

30:42.542 --> 30:45.459
That's the problem with new artists.
They start but never finish.

30:45.709 --> 30:48.334
Then there's Rajni sir.
He starts one task but finishes two.

30:48.459 --> 30:49.167
Correct.

30:49.250 --> 30:51.042
Of course.
Rajni sir's great.

30:51.209 --> 30:54.000
He fires a bullet
which splits in four.

30:54.500 --> 30:57.167
If Hollywood does it... wow!
But if Tollywood does it... how?

30:57.709 --> 31:00.334
And since when have you
started watching Rajnikant films?

31:00.625 --> 31:01.834
Shut up. I...

31:01.917 --> 31:03.917
Yes? Hello.

31:03.959 --> 31:04.625
Hello.

31:04.709 --> 31:05.875
-Yo, bro.
-I'm going in.

31:05.959 --> 31:07.042
Hey, JP.

31:07.417 --> 31:09.584
You won't go inside.
Or our friendship is over.

31:09.667 --> 31:10.459
Listen.

31:10.542 --> 31:12.209
We have to find this Abhimanyu Veer.

31:12.625 --> 31:14.042
Yes, bro... I'm listening.

31:14.125 --> 31:15.167
I love you, Manny.

31:16.292 --> 31:18.375
Stop crying, please.
I'll be there in 10 minutes, okay?

31:18.459 --> 31:20.125
-I love you, too.
-Why is he crying?

31:20.209 --> 31:21.292
-Got eggs at home?
-What?

31:21.375 --> 31:22.459
How many? Get them all.

31:22.542 --> 31:23.584
I can't, Manny.

31:23.750 --> 31:25.709
I can't come.
Ma and Dad are downstairs.

31:25.792 --> 31:26.792
"Seize the day!"

31:26.875 --> 31:29.375
-Stop with the film dialogues.
-"Make those 10 minutes count."

31:30.709 --> 31:31.834
Please!

31:34.459 --> 31:35.542
Okay.

31:36.375 --> 31:37.542
Always, forever...

31:39.292 --> 31:40.584
-Never ever!
-JP.

31:41.875 --> 31:42.959
-Always, forever.
-JP!

31:43.834 --> 31:44.917
-Come.
-Never ever.

31:47.042 --> 31:48.125
Always, forever.

31:49.917 --> 31:51.042
Never ever.

31:52.625 --> 31:54.167
-Always forever.
-Break up?

31:56.792 --> 31:59.084
-Sorry.
-No... betrayal.

31:59.959 --> 32:02.792
She always said
that she would be my eyes.

32:03.125 --> 32:04.792
Bro, don't stress.

32:05.209 --> 32:06.542
It's time for revenge.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.667
Manny, revenge isn't going
to alleviate my pain.

32:08.750 --> 32:12.084
It's not about alleviation
but revolution.

32:12.250 --> 32:13.167
Hold this.
Come here.

32:13.250 --> 32:14.959
-What should I do with it?
-Come here.

32:15.750 --> 32:16.792
Throw it on her.

32:16.875 --> 32:19.000
-No way!
-Lob it.

32:19.084 --> 32:20.792
-Throw away all your anger.
-Did it hit?

32:20.875 --> 32:22.375
Channel all your anger and throw.

32:23.042 --> 32:25.459
-It's a hit!
-It hit.

32:25.625 --> 32:26.792
Try it. Go for it.

32:27.292 --> 32:29.667
-Go on, Kizie.
-Throw. I'm going to throw one now.

32:29.709 --> 32:30.709
Aim for the bedroom.

32:30.792 --> 32:33.167
-How do I know where her bedroom is?
-It's there. On the left.

32:33.250 --> 32:34.292
Throw it.

32:34.625 --> 32:36.250
Score!

32:36.334 --> 32:37.125
Yes!

32:38.167 --> 32:38.792
Oh, God.

32:38.875 --> 32:40.000
Hello, Damania ma'am.

32:40.084 --> 32:41.792
Manny, what are you doing here?

32:42.000 --> 32:44.542
Ma'am, your daughter
broke my friend's heart.

32:44.625 --> 32:45.542
Go inside.

32:45.667 --> 32:48.125
We're here to break your house
not your heart.

32:48.334 --> 32:50.625
But remember,
you can still call my dad.

32:50.709 --> 32:52.250
You have his number, right?

32:52.500 --> 32:53.667
Go inside.  Go on.

32:53.750 --> 32:55.125
-Let's get back to it, bro.
-Really?

32:55.209 --> 32:56.500
With all your might.

32:57.000 --> 32:57.959
Score!

32:58.625 --> 32:59.542
Listen.

33:00.584 --> 33:01.584
One for the...

33:01.667 --> 33:03.084
I want to meet Abhimanyu Veer.

33:03.584 --> 33:05.375
The song must get completed.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.292
-It's not possible.
-Why?

33:07.375 --> 33:09.542
I've tried desperately.
He has disappeared.

33:09.667 --> 33:12.875
Even Invisible Man
was ultimately found.

33:12.959 --> 33:14.750
Abhimanyu Veer is hardly a challenge.

33:15.000 --> 33:16.625
What say?

33:17.500 --> 33:19.584
When am I starting shoot?

33:19.792 --> 33:22.459
Bro, we've got our heroine!

33:22.542 --> 33:23.834
Kizie Basu.

33:23.917 --> 33:26.959
The name's enough
to rock the country.

33:27.000 --> 33:30.917
Rascal, are you here to avenge me
or start your own love story?

33:30.959 --> 33:31.917
-Sorry.
-Concentrate!

33:32.000 --> 33:33.959
Come on, Kizie.
Throw them.

33:34.500 --> 33:35.792
What an aim.

33:35.875 --> 33:38.417
Hold this. Aim at the kitchen

33:38.667 --> 33:40.667
I have no idea where the kitchen is.

33:40.959 --> 33:45.125
These scenes highlighted
in yellow are Manny's.

33:45.334 --> 33:46.667
And the orange ones are mine.

33:46.834 --> 33:48.375
-And which is the next scene?
-This one.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.709
We'll shoot your intro.
What say, JP?

33:50.792 --> 33:52.375
What was it?
The rain sequence.

33:52.459 --> 33:54.584
Damsel in distress.
In rain-soaked tresses.

33:56.459 --> 33:57.792
I'm no damsel in distress.

33:58.042 --> 33:59.000
I'm Bengali.

33:59.375 --> 34:01.000
And Bengali girls are dangerous.

34:01.834 --> 34:03.500
'Rajni Arrives, Dreams Revive'.

34:03.584 --> 34:05.250
Shot number 1. Take number 1.

34:05.584 --> 34:06.584
Action.

35:54.625 --> 35:57.459
And then our worst fears came true.

35:57.875 --> 36:01.042
JP got operated
and lost his sight.

36:01.375 --> 36:04.917
But, we had promised each other
to complete the film.

36:05.084 --> 36:06.625
So... action.

36:39.209 --> 36:41.792
Though the lion is called
the King of the jungle,

36:41.875 --> 36:44.000
the lioness has all the power.

36:44.250 --> 36:48.917
In her lifetime,
a lioness mates with multiple lions.

36:49.250 --> 36:51.000
It is believed
that in this excited state,

36:51.084 --> 36:54.459
a lioness can have sex
anywhere between 20-40 times

36:54.542 --> 36:57.000
without even taking a break
for food or water.

36:57.250 --> 36:58.375
When the lioness is away hunting...

36:58.667 --> 37:00.292
Such stamina!

37:00.375 --> 37:04.167
The lion is unable to mate even once.

37:05.125 --> 37:07.417
It's all a lie.
They must be on an energy drink.

37:08.125 --> 37:10.375
When the lioness returns from her hunt

37:10.542 --> 37:12.167
the lion loses his cool...

37:23.042 --> 37:24.834
What do you do?

37:25.292 --> 37:27.584
I'm an astronaut.
I'm going to NASA next week.

37:27.750 --> 37:30.917
You? A scientist?

37:31.584 --> 37:35.625
Actually, my father is very rich
so I don't need to do anything.

37:39.042 --> 37:40.625
-You should.
-Sure.

37:40.959 --> 37:42.584
You're not that young anymore.

37:47.834 --> 37:50.250
-Why are you joking?
-Me? It's you who's being funny.

37:50.334 --> 37:53.084
-Is this any food to offer a guest?
-Isn't the salt less?

37:53.167 --> 37:54.042
Stop it, dad.

37:54.125 --> 37:55.459
More like, absent.

37:55.584 --> 37:57.042
-What?
-Yes.

37:57.125 --> 37:59.917
-These potatoes are like rocks.
-Immanuel says there's no salt in the food.

38:00.334 --> 38:01.750
-What?
-Oh my God.

38:02.084 --> 38:03.709
-What happened?
-Salt.

38:07.375 --> 38:09.459
Didn't you like the food?

38:11.917 --> 38:14.167
Do you know that she secretly
watches reality shows at night?

38:14.250 --> 38:15.084
-What?
-Yes.

38:15.167 --> 38:16.875
And she also votes
for her favourite contestants.

38:16.917 --> 38:18.000
No, Ma. He's lying.

38:18.084 --> 38:19.209
-That's my phone.
-That's the one she uses.

38:19.292 --> 38:20.542
-Look. Check it.
-No!

38:20.625 --> 38:21.959
What is this, Kizie?

38:22.209 --> 38:25.459
And she's becoming violent.

38:25.917 --> 38:27.834
-Ma...
-I'm very disappointed with you, Kizie.

38:27.917 --> 38:30.167
-He's lying.
-You don't listen to me anymore.

38:30.334 --> 38:32.209
I don't do any of that.
Honestly!

38:32.292 --> 38:33.292
Liar!

38:33.917 --> 38:36.334
-Why did you tell Mom?
-I didn't. Your dad did.

38:36.417 --> 38:38.125
I've been trying
to say it since 25 years.

38:38.209 --> 38:39.500
I saw a chance today.

38:39.709 --> 38:41.042
There's less salt in the food.

38:41.125 --> 38:42.292
Very good.

38:43.417 --> 38:45.209
If you don't like the food,
don't have it.

38:45.375 --> 38:47.209
Don't force yourself.

38:56.917 --> 38:57.917
I'm diabetic.

39:06.875 --> 39:09.834
Tomorrow you bring
all your reports to me, all right?

39:10.084 --> 39:11.459
We'll have a separate consultation on...

39:11.542 --> 39:12.417
Kizie.

39:12.542 --> 39:13.250
Manny?

39:13.500 --> 39:14.209
Sir.

39:14.292 --> 39:15.500
Manny, what are you doing?

39:15.584 --> 39:16.625
Get up.

39:16.792 --> 39:18.500
-What happened?
-Sir, her life's in danger.

39:18.584 --> 39:19.667
-What?
-Come, come.

39:19.750 --> 39:21.084
-Manny!
-I'm going, sir.

39:21.167 --> 39:23.250
Manny, what happened?
Take me along.

39:23.334 --> 39:24.667
I want to show you something.

39:24.709 --> 39:26.709
-But Manny, what happened?
-See, you have to help me.

39:26.750 --> 39:31.250
Abhimanyu Veer's song is driving me mad.

39:31.709 --> 39:33.417
-You're welcome.
-Yeah, but...

39:33.500 --> 39:34.917
Don't you think
we need closure on it?

39:34.959 --> 39:36.792
Shouldn't we know how it ends?

39:37.000 --> 39:39.834
But, it's very tough to find him.

39:41.334 --> 39:42.417
Is it?

39:42.500 --> 39:43.750
-Yes.
-Have you tried?

39:43.834 --> 39:44.917
I...

39:45.417 --> 39:46.792
Here.

39:50.250 --> 39:52.292
I think I've found Invisible Man.

40:00.000 --> 40:03.084
"Dear Immanuel Rajkumar Junior.

40:03.542 --> 40:05.167
"Thank you for writing to me.

40:05.209 --> 40:07.417
"That incomplete song was my last one.

40:07.500 --> 40:09.459
"You can't create music.
It flows from within.

40:09.584 --> 40:10.959
"So, to answer your question...

40:11.042 --> 40:14.709
"Forget fans, I can't even complete
the song for myself, sir."

40:15.209 --> 40:17.125
He called me 'sir'.

40:17.834 --> 40:20.042
"And so, your question
will remain unanswered.

40:20.292 --> 40:23.334
"But I'm glad to know
that you and your friend Kizie Basu...

40:24.000 --> 40:26.209
"liked my song.

40:26.292 --> 40:29.750
"Thank you for your generous email.
Regards, Abhimanyu Veer."

40:37.459 --> 40:41.042
Dear Mr Abhimanyu Veer.

40:43.375 --> 40:46.750
Thank you for your reply.

40:49.917 --> 40:56.292
I don't know why
but I feel that you will understand me.

41:00.500 --> 41:05.709
I might not live for very long.

41:08.625 --> 41:10.125
And your songs...

41:12.292 --> 41:15.042
capture the loss of a loved one.

41:15.667 --> 41:19.584
Ma, Dad, Manny...

41:20.959 --> 41:27.125
Is there no way
of saving them from this hurt?

41:28.084 --> 41:29.834
I want to meet you.

41:30.709 --> 41:31.625
Please.

41:31.917 --> 41:34.000
Love, Kizie Basu.

41:43.792 --> 41:45.000
Elbow out.

41:50.209 --> 41:52.792
It shouldn't slump.
Like this.

41:54.292 --> 41:55.834
Do you know how to dance?

41:55.917 --> 41:57.125
Sure, why not?

41:57.917 --> 42:03.042
Engineering students know it all,
but engineering.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.625
Come here.
Give me your hand.

42:07.959 --> 42:08.709
Fine?

42:09.500 --> 42:11.209
One, two...

42:15.625 --> 42:17.042
Sorry, I forgot.

42:17.250 --> 42:18.042
What?

42:19.625 --> 42:21.292
Son, Pushpinder.

42:21.584 --> 42:23.959
Let's dance together.

42:24.250 --> 42:25.459
The hand goes here.

42:30.792 --> 42:32.584
Are you going with Manny?

46:44.417 --> 46:46.167
I told you I'm awesome.

46:49.542 --> 46:50.542
Hello.

46:54.500 --> 46:55.500
Kizie?

46:58.209 --> 47:01.042
You can't leave me high and dry.

47:01.417 --> 47:02.334
Shut up.

47:09.125 --> 47:11.959
Manny, it's 1 am.

47:12.959 --> 47:13.917
So?

47:15.459 --> 47:17.834
I should sleep.

47:21.750 --> 47:22.542
Seri.

47:22.875 --> 47:23.709
Seri?

47:25.250 --> 47:26.334
Is that Tamil?

47:28.000 --> 47:29.000
Yes.

47:29.750 --> 47:32.250
Means okay in Tamil.

47:33.292 --> 47:34.875
I like the sound of the word.

47:35.625 --> 47:36.625
Seri.

47:37.042 --> 47:41.959
Manny, from now on,
'Seri' is our word.

47:46.209 --> 47:47.542
Seri, Kizie Basu.

47:49.625 --> 47:53.834
Seri... Immanuel Rajkumar Junior.

48:01.209 --> 48:03.459
It's often said,
love is like falling asleep.

48:03.917 --> 48:08.375
It happens slowly, then all at once.

48:08.709 --> 48:10.417
It happened to me, too.

48:10.875 --> 48:13.792
I fell asleep
while talking to Manny.

48:53.250 --> 48:54.917
"Dear Ms Basu.

48:55.167 --> 48:58.292
"It's tough to answer your questions
on email.

48:58.542 --> 49:02.375
"Sometimes the right words evade you.

49:03.000 --> 49:06.042
"But, if you're ever in Paris,
let's meet.

49:06.709 --> 49:08.667
"Yours sincerely, Abhimanyu Veer."

49:08.750 --> 49:09.792
-Ma!
-What happened?

49:09.875 --> 49:11.709
-Ma... Dad!
-What's wrong?

49:12.625 --> 49:13.917
Nothing. Sorry, Dad.

49:14.000 --> 49:15.250
Then why did you scream?

49:15.459 --> 49:16.875
This!

49:17.542 --> 49:18.792
"Dear Ms Basu.

49:18.875 --> 49:22.042
"It's tough to answer your questions
on email.

49:22.125 --> 49:25.542
"Sometimes the right words evade you.

49:26.250 --> 49:28.625
"But, if you're ever in Paris,
let's meet."

49:29.209 --> 49:31.334
You can't go to Paris
with him, Kizie.

49:32.584 --> 49:34.292
You don't even know him
well enough.

49:34.375 --> 49:36.042
You don't know him!

49:37.125 --> 49:39.459
What do you mean?
What are you trying to tell me?

49:39.542 --> 49:41.334
Ma, stop over reacting.

49:41.625 --> 49:44.542
Am I? Really?

49:44.625 --> 49:47.209
Do you seriously think
that I'm over reacting?

49:47.542 --> 49:49.167
Just tell me the truth.

49:50.292 --> 49:52.625
-Is your virginity safe?
-What's wrong with you?

49:52.709 --> 49:55.250
-What's wrong with me?
-Yes! It's safe.

49:55.375 --> 49:57.334
I've locked it away safely
in a Swiss bank locker.

49:57.375 --> 49:59.875
-Get it back when I'm dead.
-Kizie!

50:01.500 --> 50:02.375
What's this?

50:13.625 --> 50:14.625
I'm sorry.

50:16.250 --> 50:17.542
I'm sorry, Dad.

50:19.584 --> 50:21.250
I want to go to Paris.

50:21.792 --> 50:22.959
I have to go.

50:25.667 --> 50:27.250
Sweetheart, your mother is right.

50:27.875 --> 50:31.917
How can you go alone?
Your body can't take the travel.

50:32.209 --> 50:34.042
Dad, I'm fine.

50:34.125 --> 50:35.834
No, you're not, Kizie.

50:35.917 --> 50:37.250
Am I not saying that?

50:38.125 --> 50:39.625
Okay.

50:40.292 --> 50:42.292
Let me talk to Dr Jha.

50:42.500 --> 50:44.500
If he gives permission then...

50:45.125 --> 50:48.542
Kizie! Why are you saying that?

50:48.625 --> 50:49.917
I'm speaking to my daughter.

50:50.000 --> 50:52.042
What are you saying?
If Dr Jha gives permission will you...

50:52.125 --> 50:54.542
-Dr Jha is the best person to...
-For what?

50:54.625 --> 50:56.792
Does every darn thing
have to be a fight?

51:04.000 --> 51:05.750
-I don't know.
-Why?

51:06.209 --> 51:08.959
You said the PET scan report
was normal.

51:09.125 --> 51:12.042
I meant the cancer
was in control for the time being.

51:12.167 --> 51:15.750
I'm going just for a few days.
I'm not moving there permanently.

51:15.834 --> 51:19.334
I can't give you permission
to go alone.

51:19.542 --> 51:22.209
Alone?
Manny's with me.

51:22.292 --> 51:25.625
Manny! I'd never give you permission
to go alone with him.

51:27.667 --> 51:29.334
You're talking like Ma now.

51:31.542 --> 51:33.417
Only on one condition.

51:33.959 --> 51:37.042
Only if Mrs Basu goes with you.

51:37.500 --> 51:38.500
What?

51:39.709 --> 51:40.542
Ma!

51:40.625 --> 51:41.584
Me?

51:43.000 --> 51:44.709
Ma will come with me.

51:44.917 --> 51:46.334
It's the perfect idea.

51:46.417 --> 51:47.459
Why me?

51:47.542 --> 51:49.042
Ma, you've never seen Paris.

51:49.125 --> 51:50.667
What will I do there?

52:10.834 --> 52:13.000
-Hello, Kizie Basu.
-Hello, Junior.

52:13.334 --> 52:17.084
Ladies and gentlemen,
hold onto your hearts.

52:17.125 --> 52:19.209
Here's presenting...

52:21.459 --> 52:22.709
-Manny?
-What?

52:25.375 --> 52:27.000
I've made all the travel bookings.

52:27.084 --> 52:29.792
Jamshedpur - Ranchi - Delhi...
And straight to...

52:30.417 --> 52:31.292
-Paris!
-Paris!

52:31.375 --> 52:32.459
Kizie Basu, Paris!

52:32.542 --> 52:34.625
-What are you saying?
-Seriously.

52:35.167 --> 52:37.542
Now, it's your turn...

52:38.750 --> 52:39.417
to...

52:39.542 --> 52:40.584
Of course, right?

52:42.750 --> 52:46.334
But you could have given me
this information on the phone.

52:46.584 --> 52:50.750
I could have.
But, I haven't come to give.

52:51.584 --> 52:54.334
I've come to receive.
Kissie...

52:57.625 --> 53:01.250
I've heard that a first kiss
is very special.

53:02.667 --> 53:03.459
Yes.

53:04.000 --> 53:06.292
Ask me.
I've had several first kisses.

53:06.375 --> 53:09.250
I was 15 and she, 17.
We were in the canteen...

53:09.375 --> 53:10.459
Manny!

53:16.250 --> 53:19.375
Why do I get the feeling
that our first kiss will be very special?

53:20.709 --> 53:22.334
Don't you feel the same?

53:23.000 --> 53:23.792
I do.

53:24.000 --> 53:25.042
You do?

53:25.209 --> 53:26.292
Okay...

53:29.292 --> 53:30.834
Come on. Get up.

53:31.000 --> 53:32.084
-Hey!
-Leave.

53:32.459 --> 53:34.875
You can't get rid of me
in Paris, Kizie Basu.

53:35.417 --> 53:36.834
-Out!
-Okay.

53:40.834 --> 53:41.834
Manny!

53:45.459 --> 53:46.459
Bye.

53:56.750 --> 53:58.875
Manny...

54:01.084 --> 54:04.375
instantly puts a smile on my face.

54:05.209 --> 54:06.959
Makes my heart leap.

54:07.500 --> 54:08.584
Breaking news!

54:09.042 --> 54:11.959
Cancer can't stand your happiness.

54:56.709 --> 54:59.000
I couldn't see clearly.

54:59.459 --> 55:02.542
But, mom's rolling tears
made me sense her fear.

55:06.459 --> 55:08.792
Dad's false promises
were dripping with distress.

55:11.792 --> 55:13.375
I was scared, too.

55:17.084 --> 55:19.500
I was scared that I would
never be able to see

55:19.875 --> 55:21.709
Manny's stupid smile...ever again.

56:52.208 --> 56:54.417
Hi. I'm alive.

56:55.708 --> 56:58.333
I guess Kizie really means a latch.

57:04.833 --> 57:07.458
But now, I've found reason
to latch on to life.

57:10.083 --> 57:13.542
However, I was scared to meet
that reason in my current state.

57:14.667 --> 57:17.833
I guess, we were all scared.

57:18.333 --> 57:21.667
Ma and Dad were scared
of the medical terms.

57:22.750 --> 57:25.625
The more experienced the doctor,
the more complicated the words.

57:26.542 --> 57:28.708
Dad's nodding in agreement...

57:29.208 --> 57:31.542
but isn't processing any information.

57:32.500 --> 57:35.542
My team and I are right here.
Okay?

57:36.375 --> 57:37.250
Okay.

57:37.958 --> 57:40.500
All the reports by 5 o'clock, please.

57:40.583 --> 57:41.875
Okay. Sure, sir.

57:45.417 --> 57:46.417
Dad...

57:47.750 --> 57:48.750
Manny?

57:48.958 --> 57:50.500
He's waiting outside.

57:51.250 --> 57:52.625
He wants to meet you.

58:09.417 --> 58:10.750
How's Kizie, sir?

58:11.417 --> 58:12.417
Better.

58:21.708 --> 58:23.750
She doesn't want to meet you.

58:26.750 --> 58:28.583
I'm not here to meet her, either.

58:29.125 --> 58:30.500
I came to see you.

58:32.167 --> 58:33.292
Really?

58:34.292 --> 58:35.708
No... I'm lying.

58:39.708 --> 58:41.542
I'm not going anywhere.

59:17.458 --> 59:21.167
Kizie, love... the door's open.
Don't worry. Okay?

59:21.417 --> 59:22.625
Thanks, Dad.

59:22.833 --> 59:24.042
Good night.

59:29.750 --> 59:30.750
It's Manny.

59:31.500 --> 59:32.500
I know, Dad.

59:34.583 --> 59:36.125
It's not fair to him.

59:36.583 --> 59:39.542
It's my problem.
He doesn't need to suffer through it.

59:40.708 --> 59:43.250
Correct. Absolutely.

59:44.417 --> 59:46.583
We didn't need to suffer, too.

59:46.917 --> 59:51.125
We should've left you
at an orphanage in Zambia.

59:51.417 --> 59:52.417
Right?

59:55.917 --> 1:00:00.042
Let him decide
whether he wants to suffer or not.

1:00:00.875 --> 1:00:01.792
Okay?

1:00:16.417 --> 1:00:17.667
Kizie Basu.

1:00:18.292 --> 1:00:19.250
Immanuel.

1:00:20.875 --> 1:00:22.250
Are you okay?

1:00:24.375 --> 1:00:26.000
Not really.

1:00:27.458 --> 1:00:28.625
I'm not okay.

1:00:29.167 --> 1:00:30.542
Tell me what happened.

1:00:31.542 --> 1:00:33.500
Manny, I want to go to Paris.

1:00:33.792 --> 1:00:35.667
I want to meet Abhimanyu Veer.

1:00:36.167 --> 1:00:37.917
Why is 'I'm Yours' incomplete?

1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:40.875
And were it to get complete,
how would it end?

1:00:41.000 --> 1:00:43.875
-I need to know.
-And where do I feature in all this?

1:01:13.375 --> 1:01:14.792
I hope you know...

1:01:14.958 --> 1:01:19.292
You ignoring me won't change
my feelings for you.

1:01:22.958 --> 1:01:26.750
Manny, we can't be together.

1:01:27.292 --> 1:01:28.292
Why not?

1:01:28.792 --> 1:01:31.333
It can't be...

1:01:32.292 --> 1:01:33.292
Friends?

1:01:33.917 --> 1:01:36.167
We can be friends, right?
Friends.

1:01:41.042 --> 1:01:42.667
-Friends.
-Friends.

1:01:43.167 --> 1:01:45.333
We're all friends.
You're a friend. I'm a friend.

1:01:45.417 --> 1:01:46.792
Okay, bro?
We're all friends.

1:01:46.917 --> 1:01:47.875
Okay?

1:01:48.250 --> 1:01:48.958
Seri?

1:01:49.042 --> 1:01:49.708
Seri.

1:02:10.708 --> 1:02:12.708
She wants to go to Paris
with her ill health.

1:02:13.083 --> 1:02:14.792
She's only thinking about Paris.

1:02:14.875 --> 1:02:16.625
We're tired of explaining to her, doctor.

1:02:16.708 --> 1:02:19.292
Can you please explain
the seriousness of things to her?

1:02:19.542 --> 1:02:21.708
Kizie, it's very risky to travel.

1:02:22.000 --> 1:02:23.542
Your immune system's very weak.

1:02:23.625 --> 1:02:27.292
Paris has doctors.

1:02:27.458 --> 1:02:28.750
I'll be okay.

1:02:29.083 --> 1:02:30.750
I've given my advice.

1:02:31.167 --> 1:02:33.833
Finally, it's a family decision, Mr Basu.

1:02:44.167 --> 1:02:46.083
Why the deathly silence?

1:02:48.958 --> 1:02:52.333
It's a personal family matter.
Else, I would've decided.

1:02:59.500 --> 1:03:01.250
Come, time for bed.

1:03:04.208 --> 1:03:05.458
Didn't hear me?

1:03:15.875 --> 1:03:18.083
You won't be able to convince her.

1:03:18.292 --> 1:03:19.458
You can't.

1:03:20.792 --> 1:03:22.208
Will you have a beer?

1:03:22.333 --> 1:03:23.042
What?

1:03:23.125 --> 1:03:24.208
Beer.

1:03:24.875 --> 1:03:26.625
They've gone to sleep.
Want one?

1:03:27.750 --> 1:03:29.875
Don't act silly.
You aren't allowed to drink.

1:03:29.958 --> 1:03:31.167
I know.

1:03:32.458 --> 1:03:33.458
But...

1:03:34.708 --> 1:03:36.500
sometimes it's fun being silly.

1:03:50.167 --> 1:03:52.375
So, you love Kizie, right?

1:03:57.500 --> 1:03:58.500
Really?

1:04:03.208 --> 1:04:04.542
But, I know...

1:04:06.792 --> 1:04:10.042
and I really appreciate
your concern.

1:04:10.917 --> 1:04:13.458
But don't you feel that
in her current condition...

1:04:16.417 --> 1:04:17.875
it's a bit silly?

1:04:26.958 --> 1:04:31.417
When my leg was operated,
I told Dad...

1:04:33.000 --> 1:04:34.625
Please don't cut my leg.

1:04:35.000 --> 1:04:36.500
How will I...

1:04:39.208 --> 1:04:40.792
How will I play basketball?

1:04:41.167 --> 1:04:42.708
And he said the same thing.

1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:44.292
Please don't be silly.

1:04:45.875 --> 1:04:47.500
I may have been acting silly.

1:04:48.583 --> 1:04:53.417
But, that one moment
changed my life completely.

1:04:56.958 --> 1:04:59.083
I played basketball
after the surgery, too.

1:05:00.542 --> 1:05:02.875
But, it didn't have
the same magic.

1:05:03.667 --> 1:05:07.500
When I jumped,
I didn't enjoy the flight.

1:05:07.667 --> 1:05:10.250
When I ran,
I didn't know why I was running.

1:05:11.083 --> 1:05:12.917
Losing a game was justified.

1:05:13.458 --> 1:05:18.375
And in a freak case when I won,
I didn't enjoy the success.

1:05:20.792 --> 1:05:23.917
I mean, there was a feeling
of being incomplete.

1:05:25.250 --> 1:05:30.083
Like Abhimanyu Veer's song.

1:05:34.042 --> 1:05:36.417
I dream big.

1:05:38.833 --> 1:05:41.750
But, I'm not as driven
to fulfil them.

1:05:43.042 --> 1:05:45.375
Kizie has a small dream.

1:05:46.125 --> 1:05:50.625
And I really want
to fulfil it for her.

1:05:56.750 --> 1:05:57.958
I know.

1:05:58.583 --> 1:06:00.083
I know it's a bit silly.

1:06:00.167 --> 1:06:04.000
Going to Paris in this condition,
is a bit silly.

1:06:04.958 --> 1:06:07.708
But to fulfil Kizie's dream...

1:06:10.292 --> 1:06:13.083
The fun in that silliness
is unparalleled.

1:07:50.125 --> 1:07:52.500
So, Kizie Basu...

1:07:52.875 --> 1:07:56.667
Are you going to meet
Abhimanyu Veer or Mr Manny?

1:08:02.500 --> 1:08:06.708
You had a favourite dress
when you were eight.

1:08:07.750 --> 1:08:10.375
You'd wear it every evening.

1:08:10.667 --> 1:08:13.417
You loved that dress
so much, Kizie Basu.

1:08:14.208 --> 1:08:17.000
I loved that dress
because you had stitched it for me.

1:08:18.458 --> 1:08:19.708
Yes.

1:08:20.417 --> 1:08:23.042
I should've stitched
this one, too.

1:08:23.375 --> 1:08:25.208
Isn't it too revealing?

1:08:27.167 --> 1:08:29.375
Ma, it's fine.

1:08:29.542 --> 1:08:31.917
Is it really? Really?

1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:33.417
It's fine?

1:08:33.708 --> 1:08:35.417
Won't do.

1:09:18.542 --> 1:09:19.542
AV.

1:09:26.500 --> 1:09:28.750
Cold coffee with ice cream anybody?

1:09:29.083 --> 1:09:30.667
-No, sir.
-No, sir.

1:09:31.583 --> 1:09:32.583
Come.

1:09:34.500 --> 1:09:37.500
AV doesn't drink alcohol.
Only cold coffee.

1:09:40.458 --> 1:09:43.250
Alcohol is bad for the liver.
You shouldn't drink.

1:09:44.917 --> 1:09:47.042
What are you doing?

1:09:47.250 --> 1:09:49.208
Cigarette smoking
is injurious to health.

1:09:49.917 --> 1:09:51.167
It can lead to cancer.

1:09:51.333 --> 1:09:52.333
Oh.

1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:54.708
But, you already have cancer.

1:09:54.958 --> 1:09:56.792
Go on. Smoke it.

1:09:57.000 --> 1:10:00.292
AV, Kizie and Manny are big fans.

1:10:00.375 --> 1:10:04.250
Actually, sir... Kizie's a big fan.

1:10:04.583 --> 1:10:06.083
And you?

1:10:09.417 --> 1:10:11.083
I worship Rajnikant.

1:10:11.250 --> 1:10:12.500
Who's that?

1:10:18.167 --> 1:10:19.250
Just joking, mate.

1:10:19.417 --> 1:10:20.500
I love Rajnikant.

1:10:20.833 --> 1:10:23.625
Aka Thalaiva. Woohoo!

1:10:27.833 --> 1:10:31.792
Sir, 'I'm Yours' is my favourite album.

1:10:32.375 --> 1:10:33.958
Mine, too. High five.

1:10:34.875 --> 1:10:37.125
Why didn't you complete the title song?

1:10:41.042 --> 1:10:43.000
'Cause I forgot to finish it!

1:10:53.750 --> 1:10:57.917
No, don't worry about it.
This is his normal behaviour.

1:11:00.375 --> 1:11:01.292
Sir.

1:11:02.500 --> 1:11:04.250
Sir, please tell me.

1:11:09.917 --> 1:11:12.083
My dad murdered my mom.

1:11:17.042 --> 1:11:18.333
I'm just joking.

1:11:18.542 --> 1:11:20.250
Mom and Dad are both
alive and kicking.

1:11:23.042 --> 1:11:24.458
Can you stop this!

1:11:25.333 --> 1:11:27.875
We've come from India
only to meet you.

1:11:28.625 --> 1:11:31.875
Can you talk normally
for just two minutes?

1:11:35.083 --> 1:11:36.000
Normally.

1:11:37.458 --> 1:11:40.417
Sir, why is your song incomplete?

1:11:41.292 --> 1:11:44.542
Did the reason
to complete the song end?

1:11:46.250 --> 1:11:48.583
Who did you write
the song for?

1:11:48.833 --> 1:11:51.625
You surely loved her...

1:11:51.875 --> 1:11:53.167
Do you still do?

1:11:53.333 --> 1:11:57.292
Can you live happily after
the person you loved has gone?

1:11:57.833 --> 1:11:59.875
Do you know what happens
after death?

1:12:00.625 --> 1:12:01.625
No... what?

1:12:03.208 --> 1:12:05.458
How would I know?
I'm still alive.

1:12:08.708 --> 1:12:12.042
But, after my death I'll come as a ghost
and let you know.

1:12:12.125 --> 1:12:13.875
Can you please shut up!

1:12:14.125 --> 1:12:17.375
Enough of this nonsense.
Please stop this charade.

1:12:17.833 --> 1:12:19.375
You guys emailed us
which is why we've come.

1:12:19.458 --> 1:12:20.458
Kizie, let's go.

1:12:20.542 --> 1:12:23.167
He needs help.
He needs medical treatment.

1:12:23.375 --> 1:12:25.292
No doctor was able to help.

1:12:25.375 --> 1:12:26.292
Yeah, sure.

1:12:27.042 --> 1:12:30.583
When someone you love dies,
so does your own will to live.

1:12:32.333 --> 1:12:34.125
But, death still doesn't take you.

1:12:37.417 --> 1:12:39.750
And it is illegal to die by suicide.

1:12:41.417 --> 1:12:43.333
So, you must continue
this sorry existence.

1:12:44.208 --> 1:12:46.708
And because we make
stupid promises to each other

1:12:46.792 --> 1:12:48.833
that the one left behind
will go through life with a smile...

1:12:48.917 --> 1:12:49.917
Smile.

1:12:51.667 --> 1:12:52.708
Smile!

1:12:53.208 --> 1:12:54.708
Why aren't you smiling?

1:12:55.375 --> 1:12:58.167
If you can't even smile now
what about after death?

1:12:58.542 --> 1:13:00.917
That's what's going to happen
with you two, as well.

1:13:01.333 --> 1:13:02.583
One of you will die.

1:13:02.750 --> 1:13:04.750
And the other, will smile and exist.

1:13:06.458 --> 1:13:07.917
Smile!

1:13:11.208 --> 1:13:15.125
Why didn't I complete the song?
Because life is incomplete.

1:13:18.500 --> 1:13:20.167
What's wrong?

1:13:22.042 --> 1:13:23.667
He was saying the truth.

1:13:24.583 --> 1:13:26.542
-That psycho?
-Yes.

1:13:28.500 --> 1:13:30.125
He was saying the truth.

1:13:30.958 --> 1:13:35.083
People can never be happy
after losing a loved one.

1:13:36.917 --> 1:13:39.000
They lose their reason to smile.

1:13:39.375 --> 1:13:42.250
How will Ma and Dad live?
How will you?

1:13:43.125 --> 1:13:44.917
I'll be happy.

1:13:46.167 --> 1:13:47.583
I'll get rid of you, after all.

1:13:48.333 --> 1:13:49.333
Shut up.

1:13:49.500 --> 1:13:50.792
Sorry.

1:13:50.958 --> 1:13:55.333
Life is incomplete like his song.

1:13:55.417 --> 1:13:57.875
I'll finish that song for you.

1:13:58.292 --> 1:14:00.333
And 10 times better, okay?

1:14:00.708 --> 1:14:03.250
I can sing it for you even now.
Just give me a second.

1:14:03.375 --> 1:14:06.375
-Just... sorry...
-It's not that...

1:14:06.542 --> 1:14:08.042
It's not funny.

1:14:08.208 --> 1:14:09.708
Can I please just talk to you.

1:14:12.292 --> 1:14:13.250
It's not funny.

1:14:13.333 --> 1:14:14.542
Look, you're smiling.

1:14:15.375 --> 1:14:16.625
I know, but...

1:14:17.125 --> 1:14:20.208
You were better off in Jamshedpur.

1:17:50.542 --> 1:17:51.833
Then?

1:17:53.708 --> 1:17:54.708
Then?

1:17:54.917 --> 1:17:55.917
Then?

1:17:56.958 --> 1:18:00.833
Then we went to Montmartre.

1:18:01.958 --> 1:18:03.292
It was beautiful.

1:18:03.542 --> 1:18:04.583
Very nice.

1:18:05.917 --> 1:18:08.375
After that... to Notre Dame.

1:18:09.458 --> 1:18:10.958
That was also...

1:18:12.792 --> 1:18:14.250
And then, Manny?

1:18:16.167 --> 1:18:17.833
-What?
-Notre Dame...

1:18:18.375 --> 1:18:19.583
That's it.

1:18:19.750 --> 1:18:21.417
Yes... that's it.

1:18:22.083 --> 1:18:23.500
-That's it?
-Yes...

1:18:23.750 --> 1:18:27.417
Yes... we were wandering the streets.

1:18:27.542 --> 1:18:28.500
Long walk.

1:18:28.583 --> 1:18:30.833
It was a nice long walk.

1:18:32.417 --> 1:18:33.833
Finish your breakfast.

1:18:35.333 --> 1:18:36.625
Long walk!

1:18:45.458 --> 1:18:47.292
Immanuel Rajkumar Junior.

1:18:47.375 --> 1:18:50.042
Just as Pushpinder is imperative
for my lungs,

1:18:51.583 --> 1:18:54.792
you are for my heart.

1:18:56.042 --> 1:19:00.542
It beats faster
every time you come closer.

1:19:02.292 --> 1:19:03.583
I love you.

1:19:06.833 --> 1:19:10.750
I love you, Immanuel Rajkumar Junior.

1:19:12.292 --> 1:19:14.667
I love you so much.

1:19:18.250 --> 1:19:19.250
Manny?

1:19:21.792 --> 1:19:22.792
Manny?

1:19:25.583 --> 1:19:27.042
What happened?

1:19:28.875 --> 1:19:29.875
Tell me.

1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:32.000
Before you went to the hospital.

1:19:34.125 --> 1:19:35.458
I just had...

1:19:38.292 --> 1:19:39.292
an ache.

1:19:42.083 --> 1:19:44.083
I did a PET scan.

1:19:45.042 --> 1:19:48.083
And it lit like a Christmas tree.

1:19:56.083 --> 1:19:57.792
Can we just pretend...

1:19:58.542 --> 1:20:00.917
I'm not dying.
I'm not going anywhere.

1:20:00.958 --> 1:20:03.750
-Can we just pretend?
-Yeah. Yes.

1:20:06.333 --> 1:20:08.708
-We'll live like this, right?
-Always.

1:20:10.333 --> 1:20:11.833
Always.

1:20:13.708 --> 1:20:14.792
Seri.

1:20:14.875 --> 1:20:15.875
Seri.

1:21:47.042 --> 1:21:49.000
I heard that...

1:21:50.333 --> 1:21:52.042
you've shot the song very well.

1:21:54.250 --> 1:21:57.667
-It's full of romance and sex.
-Shut up.

1:21:57.875 --> 1:21:59.333
We aren't making a porn film.

1:21:59.417 --> 1:22:02.250
Do I care, Manny?

1:22:02.375 --> 1:22:04.000
It's not as though I can see it.

1:22:07.583 --> 1:22:09.417
-But, Manny...
-Yes.

1:22:10.542 --> 1:22:13.333
I really miss watching porn.

1:22:13.667 --> 1:22:15.167
I'm sure.

1:22:22.417 --> 1:22:24.375
And will you miss me?

1:22:26.875 --> 1:22:27.875
Manny...

1:22:29.625 --> 1:22:31.583
why are you saying that?

1:22:31.792 --> 1:22:35.125
Of course.
I'm going to miss you loads.

1:22:43.375 --> 1:22:46.792
Slowly and steadily
Manny's health was deteriorating.

1:22:47.917 --> 1:22:51.917
We neither had anything to say
to each other, nor to hear.

1:22:55.667 --> 1:22:57.500
And I was helpless.

1:23:03.917 --> 1:23:07.333
Manny...
Manny, get up.

1:23:07.833 --> 1:23:09.250
-Kizie?
-Get up.

1:23:10.000 --> 1:23:11.000
Get up.

1:23:11.750 --> 1:23:12.583
What happened?

1:23:12.667 --> 1:23:14.958
-You're a phony.
-What?

1:23:15.125 --> 1:23:17.708
You promised to make me a heroine.

1:23:18.292 --> 1:23:20.250
-Did you forget?
-No.

1:23:20.875 --> 1:23:23.250
Who will complete JP's film?

1:23:24.167 --> 1:23:25.375
I will, of course.

1:23:25.542 --> 1:23:26.625
So?

1:23:27.833 --> 1:23:28.917
Now?

1:23:29.208 --> 1:23:31.667
Seize the day, Immanuel.

1:23:33.708 --> 1:23:35.917
It's now or never.

1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:39.458
The heroine must compromise.

1:23:40.417 --> 1:23:41.500
Okay.

1:23:43.167 --> 1:23:44.250
I'm ready.

1:25:15.875 --> 1:25:17.542
Can you come to Payal theatre?

1:25:18.458 --> 1:25:19.542
Why?

1:25:21.000 --> 1:25:22.000
What happened?

1:25:22.083 --> 1:25:23.250
I need help.

1:25:46.333 --> 1:25:47.333
Manny!

1:25:48.083 --> 1:25:49.083
Manny!

1:25:49.750 --> 1:25:51.958
Manny, what are you doing here?

1:25:52.750 --> 1:25:53.750
Manny!

1:25:54.583 --> 1:25:55.625
Why?

1:25:59.125 --> 1:26:00.875
Manny, it's infected.

1:26:01.167 --> 1:26:03.000
-I'll have to call someone.
-No, please. Kizie, no!

1:26:03.083 --> 1:26:04.958
Don't call them.
Please don't call them.

1:26:05.458 --> 1:26:07.583
-Manny!
-Don't call my dad.

1:26:07.667 --> 1:26:09.958
-I'll never talk to you.
-I'll have to call your dad.

1:26:10.250 --> 1:26:12.542
Manny, what are you doing here?

1:26:12.625 --> 1:26:15.917
I just... wanted to do
something for myself.

1:26:16.000 --> 1:26:18.042
Wanted to do it on my own.

1:26:19.208 --> 1:26:20.208
I'm...

1:26:20.792 --> 1:26:24.375
Could you help me?
Could you please help me?

1:26:24.458 --> 1:26:27.125
-I have to call the ambulance.
-I don't want to die.

1:26:30.208 --> 1:26:32.500
Hello, Tata Hospital?

1:26:32.750 --> 1:26:34.875
Please can you come
to Payal Cinema?

1:26:34.958 --> 1:26:37.417
Ramkrishna colony, Jamshedpur.

1:26:48.000 --> 1:26:49.958
The one who taught me to smile

1:26:50.500 --> 1:26:54.208
was howling in pain.
He was screaming.

1:27:00.500 --> 1:27:02.708
And I couldn't do anything.

1:27:22.958 --> 1:27:24.333
Hi, Manny.

1:27:26.750 --> 1:27:28.125
Please go.

1:27:29.708 --> 1:27:30.917
I'm fine.

1:27:34.500 --> 1:27:35.500
Really?

1:27:35.833 --> 1:27:38.042
I don't need you right now.

1:27:38.250 --> 1:27:40.292
My name means a latch.

1:27:47.000 --> 1:27:48.625
You won't leave me?

1:27:49.917 --> 1:27:51.500
Not until the very end.

1:27:57.042 --> 1:27:59.083
Manny had come home.

1:27:59.958 --> 1:28:03.958
But, how long he would survive,
was a looming question.

1:28:09.958 --> 1:28:11.333
Mr Rajkumar.

1:28:11.917 --> 1:28:13.042
Ms Basu.

1:28:13.500 --> 1:28:18.000
I told you that when I die,
you would have to give my eulogy.

1:28:18.375 --> 1:28:19.708
Have you written anything?

1:28:21.375 --> 1:28:22.375
Yes.

1:28:22.583 --> 1:28:23.833
Then hurry to the church.

1:28:23.917 --> 1:28:26.042
Manny, are you okay?

1:28:26.458 --> 1:28:28.000
I love you, Kizie Basu.

1:28:39.750 --> 1:28:45.542
Five more steps.
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

1:28:45.625 --> 1:28:46.625
Right turn.

1:28:48.792 --> 1:28:49.792
Straight.

1:28:52.083 --> 1:28:54.208
You're there. Almost.

1:29:01.792 --> 1:29:02.792
You're late.

1:29:03.167 --> 1:29:04.250
Welcome.

1:29:06.292 --> 1:29:07.292
What's happening?

1:29:08.292 --> 1:29:10.417
Tell her, bro...
What's happening?

1:29:14.583 --> 1:29:17.042
I wanted to attend my own funeral.

1:29:17.708 --> 1:29:20.875
Though I know I'm going to be
somewhere here as a ghost.

1:29:21.917 --> 1:29:23.875
In case it doesn't work out.

1:29:24.042 --> 1:29:26.625
-So... preview.
-Okay.

1:29:26.917 --> 1:29:28.333
-JP.
-Yes.

1:29:31.625 --> 1:29:33.792
I haven't prepared anything.

1:29:34.292 --> 1:29:38.375
When Manny was 24...

1:29:38.875 --> 1:29:39.958
I'm 23.

1:29:41.000 --> 1:29:43.833
You're dead, Manny.
Why're you butting in?

1:29:44.458 --> 1:29:47.000
Won't you live another year,
at least?

1:29:47.792 --> 1:29:51.875
I met Manny when he was 19.

1:29:52.292 --> 1:29:54.542
He had a killer smile, even then.

1:29:54.875 --> 1:29:58.042
And when I met him, I was charmed.

1:29:58.750 --> 1:30:01.708
I found out much later
what a jerk he really was.

1:30:04.958 --> 1:30:07.792
My family is in Bihar.

1:30:08.708 --> 1:30:13.417
Manny and his grandma
were my only family here.

1:30:14.458 --> 1:30:19.583
They became closer to me
than my real family.

1:30:26.958 --> 1:30:29.167
I sometimes feel...

1:30:31.208 --> 1:30:33.333
it's best that I lost my sight.

1:30:36.750 --> 1:30:40.333
Because I don't want to see a world
that doesn't have Manny.

1:30:42.167 --> 1:30:46.375
I've lost my sight but I will always
remember Manny's face.

1:30:47.583 --> 1:30:49.292
My best friend.

1:30:50.208 --> 1:30:53.833
Immanuel Rajkumar Junior.

1:30:56.833 --> 1:30:59.333
Whoa, that's too much emotion.

1:31:00.458 --> 1:31:02.500
So... okay, bye.

1:31:02.833 --> 1:31:04.000
Take care.

1:31:08.375 --> 1:31:09.708
Kizie Basu.

1:31:22.208 --> 1:31:26.000
When I moved from Zambia
to Jamshedpur, I was angry.

1:31:26.917 --> 1:31:27.958
And scared.

1:31:29.750 --> 1:31:33.750
I was angry because I thought, "Why me?"

1:31:35.083 --> 1:31:38.375
Why did I need Pushpinder
so early in life?

1:31:39.083 --> 1:31:41.042
And I was scared wondering...

1:31:41.167 --> 1:31:43.458
what would become
of Ma and Dad after I die?

1:31:43.833 --> 1:31:50.750
But suddenly one day,
came Manny, dancing into my life.

1:31:52.125 --> 1:31:55.917
I haven't ever met anyone
more irritating than him.

1:32:00.833 --> 1:32:02.333
Neither do I want to.

1:32:12.667 --> 1:32:16.792
He made jest of everything.
Laughed at everything.

1:32:17.750 --> 1:32:20.542
And taught me how to live life.

1:32:21.042 --> 1:32:25.042
And slowly, he became my reason to live.

1:32:27.917 --> 1:32:29.708
But, just as...

1:32:30.583 --> 1:32:33.792
quickly he came into my life...
he also exited.

1:32:34.958 --> 1:32:37.792
And left me all alone... again.

1:32:40.500 --> 1:32:44.417
Left me all alone... again.

1:32:56.333 --> 1:33:00.083
And two days later,
Manny left us.

1:33:03.292 --> 1:33:05.667
He left me a letter.

1:33:07.708 --> 1:33:10.208
Kizie, once upon a time
there were a Prince and a Princess.

1:33:10.292 --> 1:33:12.000
They died. The End.

1:33:12.583 --> 1:33:14.250
Every grandmother tells this story.

1:33:15.333 --> 1:33:16.750
But, it's an incomplete one.

1:33:17.375 --> 1:33:19.708
One that the Prince and Princess complete.

1:33:21.042 --> 1:33:24.667
We don't get to decide
when we're born or when we die.

1:33:25.333 --> 1:33:28.458
But we do get to decide
how we live our lives.

1:33:29.833 --> 1:33:32.458
So, Kizie Basu, this Prince is dead.

1:33:32.875 --> 1:33:35.125
But, his Princess lives.

1:33:35.208 --> 1:33:38.500
And until then, our story lives on.

1:34:47.083 --> 1:34:52.875
Kizie, I promised to complete
your favourite song.

1:34:54.833 --> 1:34:58.292
I had to ask that madman,
Abhimanyu Veer, for help.

1:34:58.750 --> 1:35:02.625
I'm a true lover, but a poor poet.

1:35:03.417 --> 1:35:08.375
And he's a terrible human being,
but a talented musician.

1:36:37.458 --> 1:36:38.458
Seri, Kizie Basu?

1:36:41.708 --> 1:36:42.458
Seri!
