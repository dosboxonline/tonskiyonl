00:06.280 --> 00:09.840
I bring Sutekh's gift of death.

00:09.840 --> 00:10.920
For you.

00:10.920 --> 00:13.000
And for all of this tiny,

00:13.000 --> 00:17.360
vile, incessant universe.

00:50.560 --> 00:51.560
Doctor!

00:52.840 --> 00:54.360
All of you, everyone, get out!

00:54.360 --> 00:59.160
- All of you, get out! Get out! Go!
- I bring Sutekh's dust of death.

01:00.040 --> 01:01.400
Come on! Let's go!

01:13.880 --> 01:16.040
Doc! Come on! Let's go!

01:22.920 --> 01:24.320
Hop on, cowboy.

01:25.040 --> 01:27.440
<i>Kate, this is the Doctor.</i>

01:27.440 --> 01:30.240
<i>We're on our way back.
Try to contain that thing.</i>

01:31.240 --> 01:36.000
- I bring Sutekh's dust of death.
- Open fire. All weapons.

01:57.640 --> 01:58.960
Why can't I see her?

02:04.640 --> 02:06.480
All the bullets turned to dust, ma'am.

02:12.520 --> 02:13.600
Oh, one day.

02:14.200 --> 02:17.080
I bring Sutekh's dust of death.

02:23.560 --> 02:24.960
<i>Doctor, are you there?</i>

02:24.960 --> 02:28.440
This is me signing off
with thanks and love.

02:28.960 --> 02:31.000
And please send this monster
back into hell.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.040
No!

02:32.040 --> 02:35.040
Because I have to hope
the birds will sing again.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.320
There will be birds.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.480
There's nothing we can do...

02:51.640 --> 02:53.360
- except fight.

02:57.960 --> 02:59.840
Faster! Mel, faster!

02:59.840 --> 03:01.920
I'm going as fast as I can!

03:02.520 --> 03:03.960
No, I mean faster!

03:12.840 --> 03:15.000
We're gonna die!
We're gonna die!

03:20.080 --> 03:21.240
Mel, go right!

03:30.440 --> 03:31.920
<i>We interrupt this broadcast</i>

03:31.920 --> 03:34.200
<i>with warnings
of an incident in central London.</i>

03:34.200 --> 03:37.720
<i>People are being told
to evacuate the city immediately.</i>

03:40.920 --> 03:43.400
What is it? What's going on?

03:44.600 --> 03:46.960
Do you believe in the power of prayer?

03:48.760 --> 03:50.800
I most certainly do.

03:52.800 --> 03:54.040
Then tell your Maker

03:54.040 --> 03:58.160
<i>I will come to storm down
his gates of gold</i>

03:58.160 --> 04:00.560
and seize his kingdom in my true name.

04:00.560 --> 04:02.760
What you talking about?

04:04.360 --> 04:06.920
Who-- Who are you?

04:09.880 --> 04:12.400
I'm sorry, you tiny, little woman.

04:12.920 --> 04:16.960
I'm so, so sorry it ends like this.

04:18.280 --> 04:21.520
I had such plans.

04:41.480 --> 04:43.240
<i>Time Membrane failing.</i>

04:44.040 --> 04:45.960
You, get out. Bunker 17 now.

04:45.960 --> 04:49.960
- Doctor, my mother. Why can't we see her?
- Ruby, we have got worse problems.

05:24.760 --> 05:25.920
Okay.

05:27.480 --> 05:29.000
It's a TARDIS remembered.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.960
It's made of memories.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.120
Ruby, it is feeding off you.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.840
Yeah, give it everything you've got,
babes. Remember it harder.

05:35.840 --> 05:37.760
Yes, yes. Yes, I can. Yes.

05:37.760 --> 05:41.360
If time is a memory,
then memory is a time machine.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.800
Yes. Yes. That's it.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.000
More. More, more, more.

05:53.880 --> 05:55.240
That should do it.

05:56.440 --> 05:57.440
Okay.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.560
All right.
The TARDIS is remembering itself.

06:00.560 --> 06:01.640
Doctor!

06:08.200 --> 06:12.600
We meet again, my old friend.

06:13.520 --> 06:14.720
Don't you dare.

06:15.520 --> 06:16.960
Doctor, what is that thing?

06:17.480 --> 06:20.120
Sutekh. The Death of Ages.

06:20.120 --> 06:21.680
The Typhonian Beast.

06:22.480 --> 06:25.040
The greatest monster I have ever fought.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.400
<i>If Sutekh is so totally evil,</i>

06:27.400 --> 06:29.240
<i>why didn't Horus
and the other Osirans destroy him?</i>

06:29.240 --> 06:31.440
- The Time Window has my memories too.
- <i>It was against their code.</i>

06:31.440 --> 06:33.720
<i>To have killed him would've meant
that they were no better than he...</i>

06:33.720 --> 06:35.960
It's your life, Doctor.
- <i>...so they simply imprisoned him.</i>

06:35.960 --> 06:37.800
It's telling the story of your life.

06:39.280 --> 06:42.120
A long time ago, in the England of 1911,

06:42.120 --> 06:45.760
Sutekh had been bound
and imprisoned for all eternity.

06:45.760 --> 06:48.600
But he rose again, and I defeated him.

06:49.120 --> 06:51.040
I cast you into the Time Vortex.

06:51.040 --> 06:53.960
I sent you forward to your own death.

06:54.680 --> 06:57.920
Instead, I found a home.

06:58.880 --> 07:02.360
<i>I clung to your infernal machine,</i>

07:02.360 --> 07:06.960
and for so many years, I hid.

07:06.960 --> 07:10.880
I have travelled with you
for all this time,

07:10.880 --> 07:13.800
riding the spine of your ship,

07:14.320 --> 07:20.600
staring into eternity
and evolving into my true godhood.

07:22.320 --> 07:27.520
Now I know every beat of the heart
of your time machine,

07:27.520 --> 07:30.840
and I can bend it to my will.

07:33.920 --> 07:37.160
It will stand as my altar.

07:37.760 --> 07:42.440
The temple of my empire of death.

07:44.000 --> 07:49.040
- Never yours again, Doctor. Never.

07:49.040 --> 07:52.320
But I saw inside the TARDIS.

07:52.320 --> 07:55.200
So many secrets.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.800
Her name.

07:56.800 --> 08:00.120
- Susan.
The perfect trap.

08:00.120 --> 08:03.400
<i>I created an apparition of her universe</i>

08:03.400 --> 08:08.040
so that every time we landed
on every single world,

08:08.040 --> 08:10.640
I birthed them all.

08:10.640 --> 08:13.680
My angels of death,

08:13.680 --> 08:17.920
now standing triumphant
across the universe.

08:17.920 --> 08:22.520
I bring Sutekh's dust of death.

08:23.040 --> 08:27.840
Every living thing is an abomination.

08:28.560 --> 08:34.360
I am come to release them
into blessed deaths.

08:34.360 --> 08:37.320
And I find that good.

08:37.320 --> 08:40.200
And I damn you, Sutekh.

08:41.000 --> 08:45.200
I damn you in the name of life itself.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.160
And I swear to you,

08:48.040 --> 08:50.800
with both the hearts
of the last of the Time Lords,

08:50.800 --> 08:52.040
I will stop you.

08:53.120 --> 08:54.320
I will defeat you.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.160
And I will turn back death.

08:57.160 --> 09:01.040
And why am I still alive?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.040
Killing me is your gift.

09:06.920 --> 09:09.920
And believe me, Sutekh,
I am an extinction event.

09:09.920 --> 09:11.480
So, what is stopping you?

09:12.000 --> 09:14.720
Why is the god of death not killing me?

09:15.760 --> 09:16.840
What am I missing?

09:20.560 --> 09:23.600
I'll tell you a secret, Sute.

09:26.080 --> 09:31.800
This feeling that you have now,
this doubt...

09:33.800 --> 09:36.880
Have you ever felt so alive?

09:40.040 --> 09:41.800
And doesn't it feel good?

09:45.360 --> 09:46.400
Run.

09:49.640 --> 09:50.640
Whoa!

09:52.040 --> 09:54.440
- What is it?
It's a remembered TARDIS.

09:56.080 --> 09:59.120
It's bits and pieces
of every TARDIS that ever was.

09:59.120 --> 10:02.880
Held together by hopes
and wishes and luck.

10:07.360 --> 10:09.560
Wait. Does this thing work? Can it fly?

10:09.560 --> 10:11.320
No idea.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.600
No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
We need that!

10:36.480 --> 10:38.840
- Right. Ruby Roo, Ruby Roo.

10:38.840 --> 10:39.920
Tie that to that.

10:39.920 --> 10:41.560
- Yeah? We're good.
- All right.

10:41.560 --> 10:42.640
- Oh.
- Mel?

10:42.640 --> 10:44.480
- What?
- Tie that lever down.

10:44.480 --> 10:46.560
All those switches,
down, down, down. Yeah?

10:46.560 --> 10:48.520
Ruby, see these wires?

10:48.520 --> 10:50.360
Tie them together. Tie them tight.

10:50.360 --> 10:53.440
Doctor, we're on fire.

11:00.840 --> 11:04.200
- Is this thing safe?
- Absolute death trap, Melanie B.

11:04.800 --> 11:05.880
Okay.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.720
Yeah, that's better.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.320
- Okay. Okay, that's it.

11:23.840 --> 11:24.840
That's it.

11:25.720 --> 11:26.840
Calm down.

11:31.840 --> 11:32.920
Oh, no, no.

11:33.640 --> 11:35.000
That's it. Nice and easy.

11:35.680 --> 11:36.880
Okay.

11:38.160 --> 11:40.440
You see?

11:44.040 --> 11:46.920
That hook is a molecular bond.

11:47.680 --> 11:49.920
- It's like intelligent rope.
- What? You mean, like--

11:51.240 --> 11:52.360
Intelligent glove.

11:53.960 --> 11:55.400
That was the first day we met.

11:59.240 --> 12:02.400
Man, I am so sorry.

12:09.080 --> 12:10.360
We've gotta stabilise.

12:11.120 --> 12:14.040
Because without the Time Window's
memories, we go kaboom.

12:14.680 --> 12:16.840
That screen is holding
the TARDIS together.

12:18.800 --> 12:19.880
Okay.

12:20.520 --> 12:21.520
So, what did I miss?

12:21.520 --> 12:23.440
Every Susan Triad, they were innocent?

12:23.440 --> 12:25.360
- They were all real?
- Absolutely real.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.760
Every time the TARDIS would land,
it would roll her out like...

12:30.160 --> 12:33.160
Okay, so the--
the TARDIS has a perception filter

12:33.160 --> 12:35.920
so it doesn't get noticed.
It just sits there, kind of unseen.

12:35.920 --> 12:39.520
'Cause it casts a field around it
at 66.7 metres exactly.

12:39.520 --> 12:40.800
Seventy-three yards.

12:43.200 --> 12:44.480
How do you know that?

12:46.960 --> 12:48.920
I don't--
I don't know. I just do.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.320
Funny things happen at 73 yards.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.440
People say that you can see things.

12:58.720 --> 13:02.320
So, Sutekh, he used this field,
but he used it massively.

13:02.920 --> 13:04.240
He focused his mind

13:04.240 --> 13:06.640
and created a whole new person
everywhere I'd land.

13:06.640 --> 13:09.640
But perception means that she fitted in.
She had character.

13:09.640 --> 13:11.520
She had history. She had a truth.

13:12.200 --> 13:16.360
But Doctor,
you landed on Earth a hundred times.

13:16.360 --> 13:18.480
I think that
she was reborn every time.

13:18.480 --> 13:21.920
Each time the TARDIS would land,
the idea of that woman would get stronger.

13:21.920 --> 13:24.720
By 2024, she was Susan Triad.

13:24.720 --> 13:26.160
This monumental figure.

13:26.160 --> 13:28.800
What has she done?
Sutekh called her an angel of death.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.000
What did she do?

13:53.840 --> 13:54.880
The dust of death.

13:57.840 --> 13:59.720
Spreading all over the world.

14:03.480 --> 14:05.400
- My mother, is she--
It's everyone.

14:06.280 --> 14:08.240
- No, but can't you just--
- Nothing I can do.

14:12.760 --> 14:15.000
She was--

14:16.040 --> 14:18.760
It's happening over and over again.

14:19.840 --> 14:21.640
Every time I landed there.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.480
1999...

14:26.760 --> 14:28.240
1066...

14:31.000 --> 14:32.400
2005.

14:37.160 --> 14:39.920
The Earth is dying.

14:43.520 --> 14:45.160
So many times.

15:10.920 --> 15:12.840
Every world that I ever stood upon...

15:17.880 --> 15:18.920
All dead.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.360
Venus.

15:23.960 --> 15:26.240
Telos. Karn.

15:31.000 --> 15:32.200
The Ood-Sphere.

15:40.360 --> 15:42.920
- And Skaro.
- The Daleks are dead.

15:42.920 --> 15:44.440
Everything is dead.

15:46.000 --> 15:47.200
But--

15:48.320 --> 15:50.480
There are so many places you haven't been.

15:50.480 --> 15:51.680
They must be safe.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.360
I've travelled so far.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.440
Everything caught
in that pattern is dying.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.400
The whole of time and space.

16:07.840 --> 16:08.880
I did this.

16:09.760 --> 16:10.800
You did not.

16:12.000 --> 16:13.240
No.

16:18.200 --> 16:20.320
Every sun is dead.

16:20.920 --> 16:24.560
The universe has come to a halt.

16:28.080 --> 16:29.440
And it is my fault.

16:32.680 --> 16:34.840
'Cause I travelled to all those worlds.

16:37.880 --> 16:40.320
I thought it was fun.

17:09.000 --> 17:14.520
The universe stands silent in death.

17:17.320 --> 17:21.240
Yet one thing persists.

17:22.000 --> 17:26.320
One thing keeps living despite me.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.160
The Time Lord.

17:28.160 --> 17:30.120
No. Greater than him.

17:30.880 --> 17:35.160
A secret the child carries with her.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.160
But I will find them.

17:38.160 --> 17:39.600
Out there...

17:39.600 --> 17:43.360
...in the hollows of this desolate universe,

17:43.360 --> 17:49.560
they are hiding somewhere,
lost in the wind and the wilds.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.320
Excuse me.

18:07.200 --> 18:10.080
Can you tell me...

18:10.080 --> 18:11.160
...where are we?

18:12.880 --> 18:14.040
No idea.

18:15.120 --> 18:16.880
Absolutely no idea, darling.

18:18.800 --> 18:20.720
All I've got is this chaffee.
Do you want some?

18:20.720 --> 18:24.480
That's very kind.
J-- Only if you have enough.

18:26.480 --> 18:27.600
Where did you come from?

18:29.040 --> 18:33.520
Nowhere. [sighs] Um, I-- I got a bit lost.

18:33.520 --> 18:37.120
It's been a very, very long time.

18:40.040 --> 18:41.720
I haven't seen anyone in weeks.

18:42.240 --> 18:46.080
There was a caravan that passed through,
heading towards--

18:46.720 --> 18:48.560
I don't know, somewhere over that way.

18:48.560 --> 18:51.280
They said there was food,
but I haven't seen them since.

18:54.520 --> 18:57.000
Hush now, darling.
Let me give the man his chaffee.

18:58.360 --> 18:59.480
Who is the little one?

19:02.440 --> 19:03.720
I think I called her Brindle.

19:05.720 --> 19:06.800
Brindle Dee.

19:07.800 --> 19:08.800
But I forget.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.080
What is this place called?

19:15.640 --> 19:16.800
Hard to remember. I--

19:18.680 --> 19:20.040
They say memory is dying.

19:20.840 --> 19:24.640
There was a man that said that
actual facts were dying in the death wave.

19:25.360 --> 19:27.360
But I think this was the city of...

19:29.200 --> 19:30.520
It began with a B.

19:31.680 --> 19:32.760
And the planet?

19:34.280 --> 19:35.840
I don't think I was born here.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.320
Then I met my husband.

19:39.320 --> 19:40.720
Whatever his name was.

19:40.720 --> 19:43.360
Tall. He was tall.

19:43.360 --> 19:44.480
I remember that.

19:45.680 --> 19:47.440
But it was all a very long time ago.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.040
Well, at least you survived.

19:50.040 --> 19:51.840
I'm not sure I did, really.

19:52.440 --> 19:53.440
The funny thing is,

19:53.440 --> 19:57.640
I do remember an opera house
over that way.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.880
Of all the things to remember.

20:02.400 --> 20:04.240
Maybe I worked there. Maybe I sang.

20:04.960 --> 20:07.000
But people used to come from all over.

20:07.000 --> 20:11.520
The lights and the diamonds
and all sorts of things. It was lovely.

20:15.200 --> 20:16.400
Have you got any metal?

20:19.600 --> 20:21.280
Metal is a precious thing, sir.

20:22.960 --> 20:24.920
I don't think
anything is precious anymore.

20:30.040 --> 20:33.280
I suppose you do have a very nice face.

21:02.200 --> 21:05.680
- I'll forget it in a minute.
- That's very kind of you.

21:15.840 --> 21:18.160
I will use this spoon. I promise.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.720
Might save the universe with this spoon.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.520
That would be nice.

21:25.640 --> 21:26.640
You should go now.

21:27.200 --> 21:28.760
Are you-- you okay?

21:32.040 --> 21:35.080
I think my daughter died, didn't she?

21:37.280 --> 21:38.440
And I forgot.

21:47.600 --> 21:48.600
I think she did.

21:51.880 --> 21:52.880
I'm sorry.

21:54.680 --> 21:58.280
They say it travels, the death wave,
down the family line.

22:00.320 --> 22:02.800
Except that this man, he said it's--

22:03.320 --> 22:06.600
it's-- it's perverse. That's what he said.

22:07.560 --> 22:10.840
That it's so determined to kill
that it can travel backwards.

22:11.360 --> 22:13.000
From child to mother.

22:16.520 --> 22:19.040
But it's okay
because I really am very tired.

22:21.840 --> 22:23.720
You've got such a nice face.

22:41.880 --> 22:45.680
I swear to you with a spoon.

22:53.640 --> 22:55.000
That's what we need.

22:55.000 --> 22:58.680
Just some metal, not a TARDIS memory.
Something real.

22:59.680 --> 23:02.080
Thank you, whoever you were.

23:03.600 --> 23:05.040
Look, look, look.

23:05.560 --> 23:08.960
After all this time,
it's still connected to the Time Window.

23:08.960 --> 23:11.520
Yeah, I never understood
what was all that Egyptian stuff?

23:11.520 --> 23:13.080
Cultural appropriation.

23:13.800 --> 23:14.800
<i>Release me!</i>

23:14.800 --> 23:18.080
Oh. And who were they?
That woman and the man with the hair?

23:18.080 --> 23:20.480
They just travelled in the TARDIS.

23:20.480 --> 23:23.000
<i>...or I shall destroy the cosmos!</i>
- That's how I know Mel.

23:23.720 --> 23:25.560
- We travelled together, didn't we?
- Hmm.

23:27.120 --> 23:28.120
Best time of my life.

23:28.120 --> 23:29.360
We met Einstein.

23:29.360 --> 23:32.160
<i>I'll spare the planet Earth.</i>
Did we?

23:32.160 --> 23:34.280
<i>I'll give it to you as a plaything.</i>

23:34.280 --> 23:35.760
- God, I'd forgotten.
<i>Release me!</i>

23:35.760 --> 23:37.920
- You okay?
<i>No, Sutekh...</i>

23:37.920 --> 23:39.680
Exhausted.

23:39.680 --> 23:42.400
I don't get it. What changed?
<i>No!</i>

23:42.400 --> 23:45.280
Sutekh was hidden for years.
Why did he go on the attack?

23:49.600 --> 23:51.600
- Ask that again.
Why did he go on the attack?

23:51.600 --> 23:53.840
Why did Sutekh appear on Ruby Road?

23:53.840 --> 23:54.960
It's answering you.

23:54.960 --> 23:57.120
The images are reaching out to you.

23:57.120 --> 23:59.360
- What do you mean?
They're trying to help.

24:02.920 --> 24:05.080
The Time Window is still connected
to your memories.

24:05.080 --> 24:06.720
Maybe it's trying to ask you something.

24:06.720 --> 24:08.680
But what does this
have to do with my mother?

24:09.880 --> 24:12.800
Oh, because-- because...

24:14.160 --> 24:15.280
Oh!

24:15.880 --> 24:16.920
Oh.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.600
Sutekh became visible outside the church,

24:20.600 --> 24:23.400
because when he landed
with the TARDIS in 2004,

24:23.400 --> 24:25.800
he saw the one thing
beyond his comprehension.

24:26.480 --> 24:28.320
- Your mother.
- But who is she?

24:28.320 --> 24:31.080
We don't know. And neither does he.
That's the point.

24:31.080 --> 24:32.160
Look.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.360
She drives us crazy, but Sutekh, oh.

24:38.360 --> 24:41.280
He's been riding on the back of the TARDIS
beholding all of time and space,

24:41.280 --> 24:44.320
and then he can't see one woman.
One woman.

24:44.320 --> 24:46.720
One singular, mysterious woman.

24:46.720 --> 24:50.120
No wonder he's keeping us alive.
To figure out the answer. Who is she?

24:50.120 --> 24:52.840
But if gods are scared of her,
then what the hell does that mean?

24:52.840 --> 24:56.240
She's not this big cosmic thing, is she?
Because in that case, what am I?

24:56.240 --> 24:58.440
Ruby, you are absolutely human.

24:58.440 --> 24:59.640
But who is she?

24:59.640 --> 25:02.920
- And why was she pointing at you?
- Hey. Hey, hey.

25:02.920 --> 25:04.480
Hey. Come here.

25:04.480 --> 25:06.120
<i>Melanie.</i>

25:07.680 --> 25:08.800
<i>Melanie.</i>

25:10.440 --> 25:12.240
I see you.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.920
We can find the living...

25:15.920 --> 25:18.880
- ...through time and space

25:19.480 --> 25:21.520
and family.

25:22.840 --> 25:25.600
I wish there was something
we could do to just see her.

25:25.600 --> 25:26.680
<i>But the government says--</i>

25:26.680 --> 25:28.600
- <i>What government?</i>
- Okay, then who's that?

25:28.600 --> 25:31.840
I mean,
the government has collapsed in shame.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.440
- <i>In absolute shame, Amol.</i>
- Let me see.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.880
<i>Now's the time to vote.</i>

25:36.400 --> 25:37.560
No, nothing.

25:37.560 --> 25:40.160
Give it to me.

25:42.000 --> 25:43.360
There. I mean him.

25:43.360 --> 25:45.840
- Uh, show me.
<i>...controversy about your manifesto.</i>

25:45.840 --> 25:50.240
- <i>In particular, the DNA testing regime.</i>
- It's giving you another answer.

25:50.240 --> 25:52.120
- But what is it?

25:53.160 --> 25:55.760
- That's the guy off the TV, but who's he?
- <i>I'm trying to make life better.</i>

25:55.760 --> 25:58.960
I propose compulsory DNA testing
for the entire population.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.440
- Roger ap Gwilliam.

26:02.600 --> 26:06.120
The most dangerous
prime minister in history.

26:07.640 --> 26:09.200
But that's 2046.

26:10.200 --> 26:11.520
You haven't met him, have you?

26:12.120 --> 26:14.240
No. No, I couldn't. Could I?

26:15.280 --> 26:16.800
Then why is it showing you?

26:18.440 --> 26:20.880
2046. 2046.

26:21.400 --> 26:23.640
2046.

26:23.640 --> 26:26.280
2046! He did it!

26:26.800 --> 26:30.040
DNA testing became compulsory
for the entire population in the UK.

26:30.040 --> 26:32.480
- So if your mother was still alive...
- She'd be on record.

26:32.480 --> 26:33.920
She would be on the register.

26:33.920 --> 26:36.160
We've never been able to find her
because she never got tested.

26:36.160 --> 26:38.160
But 2046, she's got no choice.

26:38.160 --> 26:41.560
It is showing us the way, Ruby.
It's showing us the path to your mother.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.080
- If I can just--
- What does that mean?

26:43.080 --> 26:45.680
- Can we find Ruby's mother?
- Yeah. And what happens if we do?

26:45.680 --> 26:47.600
One question at a time.

26:47.600 --> 26:48.680
Okay.

26:49.880 --> 26:53.200
All right. The TARDIS doesn't have
much power...

26:54.760 --> 26:59.320
...but if it can just make one final--

27:00.040 --> 27:01.360
Whoa.

27:04.760 --> 27:06.320
Oh.

27:06.320 --> 27:08.520
Handy. Love a whistle.

27:11.480 --> 27:14.560
- 2046, here we come!
- But 2046 doesn't exist, does it?

27:14.560 --> 27:16.480
Yes, but it is preserved in death.

27:16.480 --> 27:18.400
'Cause I once landed there.
So it's fixed, yeah?

27:18.400 --> 27:19.520
Hold that down.

27:21.560 --> 27:25.280
<i>I see them, Melanie.</i>

27:26.760 --> 27:32.160
<i>Every living thing contains dead cells.</i>

27:32.160 --> 27:36.800
Skin, nails, enamel.

27:36.800 --> 27:40.680
Sutekh can see through the dead.

27:41.320 --> 27:43.760
Melanie, closer.

27:44.360 --> 27:45.760
Closer.

27:45.760 --> 27:48.000
<i>Bring them to Sutekh.</i>

27:48.000 --> 27:50.520
<i>Find the mother's name!</i>

27:53.760 --> 27:55.200
2046.

28:06.520 --> 28:07.760
Thank you.

28:23.240 --> 28:26.000
I was in this building
for the overthrow of Roger ap Gwilliam.

28:28.000 --> 28:30.440
It was the Department of Health.

28:31.680 --> 28:33.320
It'll have the DNA.

28:35.120 --> 28:37.560
So, we're, like,
hacking a computer?

28:38.200 --> 28:39.520
Sort of thing, yeah.

29:06.840 --> 29:08.520
- Nice.

29:11.760 --> 29:15.320
Okay. The DNA list was locked away
under top security.

29:16.480 --> 29:18.400
But guess who invented the security.

29:24.480 --> 29:26.240
Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.

29:27.120 --> 29:28.200
Come on, come on.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.840
Yes! Yes.

29:30.480 --> 29:34.240
Okay. Mel, you better keep watch.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.080
Sutekh's servants could be anywhere.

29:38.280 --> 29:40.000
And don't take any risks.

29:40.600 --> 29:42.240
We're all getting out of this.

29:43.480 --> 29:44.560
Don't worry about me.

29:46.520 --> 29:47.720
Find that name.

30:05.680 --> 30:08.880
<i>Submit to me, Melanie.</i>

30:30.120 --> 30:31.200
That's me.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.000
So, what do we do now?

30:35.080 --> 30:36.160
Press search.

30:37.440 --> 30:39.440
Somewhere in there is your mother's name.

30:39.440 --> 30:42.640
- And maybe we can use it to fight Sutekh.

30:47.720 --> 30:50.160
Searching 76 million people.

30:58.760 --> 30:59.760
Who is she?

31:02.080 --> 31:04.960
<i>Melanie, Melanie, Melanie.</i>

31:05.760 --> 31:07.680
<i>Here, I see you.</i>

31:12.240 --> 31:16.320
<i>Submit to the will of Sutekh.</i>

31:31.360 --> 31:32.480
Keep looking.

31:43.320 --> 31:44.320
Wha--

31:46.360 --> 31:47.360
What does it mean?

31:51.400 --> 31:53.360
- She died.

31:53.880 --> 31:54.880
She died.

31:55.400 --> 31:56.480
Ruby, I'm sorry.

31:58.000 --> 31:59.360
I loved you, Mel.

31:59.360 --> 32:02.320
And what good did love do, Doctor?

32:02.320 --> 32:04.120
When did it ever help?

32:06.320 --> 32:07.520
Now give me the name.

32:07.520 --> 32:13.480
- But what does it mean?
Give Sutekh the name.

32:14.320 --> 32:20.880
<i>Bring me the Time Lord
and the child and their precious secret.</i>

32:30.080 --> 32:32.560
I bring you a gift, holy Sutekh.

32:32.560 --> 32:34.440
Excellent.

32:34.440 --> 32:40.480
The last two creatures in existence
to die at your hand.

32:40.480 --> 32:47.160
Then you can end our wretched
half-life so that silence can reign.

32:47.160 --> 32:50.440
And you can stand alone
for all eternity,

32:50.960 --> 32:57.440
gazing upon your empire
of dust and ice and oblivion.

32:58.040 --> 32:59.840
Show me the name.

33:00.360 --> 33:02.000
Show me, child.

33:07.040 --> 33:10.560
- Sutekh.
- Bring the name to me.

33:10.560 --> 33:16.920
Sutekh, I promise you I will worship you
if you just allow--

33:16.920 --> 33:18.200
Resist.

33:22.800 --> 33:27.320
You have lived for far too long,
little Lord of Time.

33:27.320 --> 33:28.560
- I've got the name.
- No! No!

33:28.560 --> 33:30.840
I'll give it to you.
Can you just let him go?

33:30.840 --> 33:32.160
Don't. Don't.

33:35.520 --> 33:38.120
- The screen, it found the name.

33:41.680 --> 33:44.040
- But I don't understand...

33:44.040 --> 33:46.400
...and I wish I could.

33:46.400 --> 33:52.160
It's the only thing
that I've ever wanted for all these years.

33:54.080 --> 33:55.640
But now I've found it.

33:57.520 --> 33:59.600
And I don't understand.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.600
- But maybe you can.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.400
Oh.

34:07.600 --> 34:10.440
Maybe this is for you.

34:11.360 --> 34:14.080
Waited for so long.

34:17.440 --> 34:18.840
You great big god of nothing.

34:18.840 --> 34:19.880
No!

34:21.400 --> 34:23.680
- No!

34:26.200 --> 34:27.720
No!

34:29.320 --> 34:31.600
'Cause I knew, Sutekh. I knew.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.120
She's too cold.

34:33.120 --> 34:34.320
Listen to me.

34:34.320 --> 34:35.440
This way.

34:39.600 --> 34:42.880
Die at the hand of Sutekh.

35:13.440 --> 35:15.360
No!

35:18.400 --> 35:21.000
I'm back.

35:34.560 --> 35:37.840
- Into the vortex.

35:52.040 --> 35:54.040
Okay, hold that lever down.

35:54.880 --> 35:56.440
What just happened?

35:56.440 --> 35:59.480
Love my whistle.

36:03.960 --> 36:05.480
- Whoa!

36:06.320 --> 36:07.680
Got it.

36:09.680 --> 36:13.040
You saw all of time and space
with me, Sutekh.

36:13.560 --> 36:16.480
So I thought, "What if you see it again?"

36:17.480 --> 36:20.160
What happens if you bring death to death?

36:20.160 --> 36:22.760
You bring life!

37:25.640 --> 37:28.320
Oh, that clever boy!

37:28.320 --> 37:30.960
- That clever boy!

37:55.480 --> 37:59.600
Bring death to death everywhere!

38:01.640 --> 38:03.360
Leave that.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.600
Hold that and that.

38:04.600 --> 38:05.680
What's happening?

38:05.680 --> 38:08.360
- Life, Ruby. Life.

38:08.360 --> 38:09.440
Oh!

38:09.440 --> 38:12.160
We bring life
to the whole flipping universe.

38:13.280 --> 38:14.880
Okay. Vortis.

38:14.880 --> 38:15.960
Tigella.

38:16.560 --> 38:17.560
Vox.

38:18.240 --> 38:20.840
Messaline. Calufrax.

38:20.840 --> 38:22.120
Spiridon.

38:23.040 --> 38:24.200
Telos.

38:25.400 --> 38:26.760
Shan Shen.

38:27.920 --> 38:31.640
The Ood-Sphere is alive.

38:31.640 --> 38:33.920
Oh.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.280
Welcome back, the Ood.

38:36.800 --> 38:37.800
And there, there.

38:38.520 --> 38:42.400
The planet is called Agua Santina.

38:49.000 --> 38:51.640
Hey.

38:57.680 --> 38:59.120
With a spoon.

39:11.520 --> 39:14.760
We fought a monster.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.200
And now...

39:21.920 --> 39:23.240
I must become a monster.

39:46.200 --> 39:47.800
Sutekh the Destroyer.

39:48.520 --> 39:51.640
The lord god of death itself.

39:52.400 --> 39:53.400
You win.

39:57.240 --> 39:58.840
Because I pride myself--

39:59.640 --> 40:02.000
I pride myself that I am better than you.

40:02.840 --> 40:05.880
- Because if you're death...
- No!

40:05.880 --> 40:07.600
...then I must represent life.

40:08.520 --> 40:11.040
Surely that's what I am. Life.

40:16.680 --> 40:18.840
And that's how you win, Sutekh.

40:20.160 --> 40:21.840
Because you turned me into this.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.640
I am the one that brings death.

40:27.320 --> 40:29.960
No!

40:34.960 --> 40:38.640
No!

41:17.120 --> 41:18.280
Sir.

41:26.920 --> 41:28.320
But I'm still me.

41:28.320 --> 41:32.480
I've still got my memories, my family.
All of that's still true, is it?

41:32.480 --> 41:33.640
Absolutely.

41:33.640 --> 41:35.800
You are who you are.

41:36.800 --> 41:39.080
The god of death created life.

41:39.680 --> 41:41.560
And he gave you a very good brain.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.840
- I think UNIT can use you.

41:44.840 --> 41:46.440
- Oh.
Oh, pet.

41:46.440 --> 41:48.480
Anything to help. I don't mind.

41:48.480 --> 41:49.680
I'll make the tea.

41:49.680 --> 41:50.920
Did you make this tea?

41:50.920 --> 41:52.200
I did, yes.

41:52.200 --> 41:53.520
- Don't make the tea.
- Oh!

41:53.520 --> 41:54.560
Ooh, Christopher!

41:55.960 --> 41:57.360
You should've seen me.

41:57.360 --> 41:58.760
I had to walk home.

41:58.760 --> 42:02.120
I got in, and your gran was telling me off
for not dusting.

42:02.120 --> 42:03.760
- Cherry.

42:03.760 --> 42:06.480
But I wanted to say--

42:06.480 --> 42:08.680
Oh, don't, Mum. It's all right.

42:08.680 --> 42:10.880
I wanted to say thank you, Doctor.

42:12.240 --> 42:14.600
You brought her home.

42:15.120 --> 42:18.800
You brought all of us back from, well,
who-knows-where.

42:20.440 --> 42:22.440
Do you remember what happened when you...

42:22.440 --> 42:25.760
- Mmm. Echoes.
- Mmm.

42:35.680 --> 42:40.800
- We've done it.
DNA retrieval, 100%.

42:53.680 --> 42:55.200
Wow.

42:55.200 --> 42:56.520
My mother.

42:58.800 --> 43:00.400
Louise Alison Miller.

43:00.960 --> 43:02.360
Thirty-five years old.

43:02.360 --> 43:04.160
Fifteen, when she gave birth to you.

43:04.680 --> 43:08.160
Records say her stepfather was--
Well, he was trouble.

43:09.120 --> 43:11.840
I think she did the right thing
getting you out of that house.

43:11.840 --> 43:14.040
She must have hidden the pregnancy.

43:14.560 --> 43:17.400
Father, William Benjamin Garnet.

43:17.400 --> 43:19.240
Fifteen at the time.

43:19.240 --> 43:21.680
Louise moved to Coventry at the age of 18.

43:21.680 --> 43:23.280
Did well. Got a degree.

43:25.640 --> 43:26.720
She's a nurse.

43:26.720 --> 43:30.600
That's what I don't understand.
She-- [chuckles] She's so ordinary.

43:30.600 --> 43:31.840
She's wonderful.

43:31.840 --> 43:35.160
No, she's wonderful, and she's ordinary,
but I love her for that.

43:35.160 --> 43:37.080
I just...

43:37.080 --> 43:39.440
How did she stay invisible...
...from a god?

43:39.440 --> 43:40.920
She defeated Sutekh.

43:40.920 --> 43:42.160
She was important...

43:44.160 --> 43:47.600
because we think she's important.
It's how everything happens.

43:47.600 --> 43:50.520
Every war, every religion,
every love story.

43:51.360 --> 43:53.320
We invest things with significance.

43:54.320 --> 43:57.720
So while the whole of creation
was turning around her,

43:58.800 --> 44:03.920
it made her sheer existence more powerful
than Time Lords and gods.

44:04.520 --> 44:09.240
In the end, the most important person
in the universe was the most ordinary.

44:12.000 --> 44:15.960
A scared little girl making her baby safe.

44:16.560 --> 44:18.400
But she pointed.

44:19.160 --> 44:20.200
She did.

44:20.920 --> 44:22.160
She pointed at you, Doctor.

44:22.160 --> 44:23.680
She wasn't pointing at me.

44:24.680 --> 44:29.560
'Cause we cleaned up the VHS.
Behind me was that lamp post.

44:30.680 --> 44:32.760
- So?
- It was a signpost.

44:34.720 --> 44:36.800
<i>She was pointing at the name of the road.</i>

44:38.760 --> 44:40.160
She was naming you.

44:45.320 --> 44:50.560
God. I always thought I was called Ruby
because the social workers chose it

44:50.560 --> 44:55.360
or the paramedics or whatever.
But, no, it was her.

44:56.040 --> 44:57.920
My own mother chose it.

44:59.960 --> 45:02.800
My name is Ruby.

45:13.440 --> 45:14.440
She's happy.

45:15.720 --> 45:19.080
She's got a flat.
She's got a fella named Mike.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.280
She goes to Spain in three weeks.

45:27.640 --> 45:28.840
And the point is,

45:29.360 --> 45:34.600
is that she has had over 7,000 days
to come and find you,

45:34.600 --> 45:35.840
and she never has.

45:36.920 --> 45:38.120
But I found her.

45:38.120 --> 45:39.440
With a time machine.

45:42.960 --> 45:43.960
Is that fair?

45:45.960 --> 45:47.880
Louise Miller made her choices and...

45:50.200 --> 45:51.720
I think we should leave that alone.

46:07.600 --> 46:10.040
What can I get you?
- Uh, oat cappuccino, please.

46:43.600 --> 46:46.120
- Ruby?
- That's me.

46:50.840 --> 46:53.720
I was named after a road.

46:54.680 --> 46:57.000
Ruby Road.

46:57.000 --> 47:01.200
You left me by a church, 19 years ago.

47:01.200 --> 47:03.000
- Oh, my God.

47:03.000 --> 47:04.640
You left me where I was safe.

47:04.640 --> 47:07.400
And I just wanna say thank you.

47:07.400 --> 47:09.320
I'm sorry.

47:09.320 --> 47:11.360
- I'm so sorry.
- No, don't.

47:13.200 --> 47:16.480
It's you.

47:22.440 --> 47:25.040
- My baby.

47:36.200 --> 47:38.400
- Ooh, that's nice.

47:39.560 --> 47:42.120
I always thought I should get in touch.

47:42.120 --> 47:45.160
Every Christmas I thought,
"Right, this is the year."

47:45.160 --> 47:48.440
But every Christmas I thought,
"What if she hates me?"

47:48.440 --> 47:51.320
There is no hatred in this house, darling.

47:51.320 --> 47:53.520
But what we have got is photos.

47:53.520 --> 47:55.280
Yeah?
I've got about 500.

47:55.280 --> 47:56.720
Mm-hmm.
Proper photos.

47:56.720 --> 47:57.800
I've printed them off.

47:57.800 --> 47:59.840
You wait till you see her
at ten years old,

47:59.840 --> 48:01.240
dressed up as David Bowie.

48:01.240 --> 48:03.440
Ah.

48:16.520 --> 48:19.080
I won't be long.

48:19.080 --> 48:22.640
We're just gonna have a catch-up
and a pizza and...

48:22.640 --> 48:25.440
Mum set up a bed in Gran's room
so Louise can stay the night.

48:26.000 --> 48:28.320
And then we can head off. You and me.

48:28.920 --> 48:29.880
Where to?

48:30.920 --> 48:31.920
Wherever you want.

48:34.640 --> 48:36.040
- Ruby.
- Come out and join.

48:36.040 --> 48:38.200
I've told her so much about you.
She knows everything.

48:38.200 --> 48:41.440
- And... Hold on. Sorry.

48:41.440 --> 48:42.680
Leave that.

48:42.680 --> 48:45.480
And, no, I said,
"Life with the Doctor is just mad."

48:45.480 --> 48:48.000
- And--

48:48.000 --> 48:49.560
Hang on. I better...

48:52.120 --> 48:53.320
Oh, my God.

48:54.120 --> 48:56.320
They think they've found him.
My dad. William.

48:56.320 --> 48:58.120
They think--

48:58.120 --> 49:00.960
Because it turns out, his mum and dad
still live at the same address,

49:00.960 --> 49:02.120
but she never told him.

49:02.120 --> 49:04.200
My mum, my real mum.

49:04.200 --> 49:07.760
So... [sighs] ...she never told Will about me,
so he doesn't even know I exist.

49:08.360 --> 49:10.920
So we've gotta go and...

49:12.640 --> 49:14.440
I'm sorry.

49:19.320 --> 49:20.320
Don't be sorry.

49:26.600 --> 49:28.160
Don't be sorry at all.

49:30.000 --> 49:33.480
Your life is out there now.

49:35.600 --> 49:40.120
I've shown you monsters
and planets and legends.

49:40.720 --> 49:41.720
But this...

49:43.920 --> 49:46.760
- Honey, your adventure is just beginning.

49:48.640 --> 49:53.760
But you could come and see my dad.

49:58.200 --> 49:59.640
You don't do that, do you?

50:05.720 --> 50:07.280
Will I ever see you again?

50:07.280 --> 50:08.880
Of course you will.

50:09.960 --> 50:10.960
Of course you will.

50:14.680 --> 50:18.880
Your own granddaughter,
you left her and never went back.

50:19.480 --> 50:20.960
And that was my mistake.

50:23.240 --> 50:25.480
Maybe I'll find her again one day.

50:27.040 --> 50:33.120
But you, Ruby Sunday,
I will see again because you changed me.

50:35.640 --> 50:38.240
I talk about family
in a way that I never did before.

50:39.040 --> 50:40.240
It's because of you.

50:42.080 --> 50:44.720
You have made my life bigger and better.

50:49.480 --> 50:52.880
And now, Ruby Sunday...

50:55.840 --> 50:56.840
goodbye.

51:19.040 --> 51:20.080
I love you.

52:16.320 --> 52:17.960
Oh, she's so gorgeous.

52:17.960 --> 52:21.120
What made you walk away?
Mum!

52:21.120 --> 52:23.560
<i>And that's how the story...</i>

52:23.560 --> 52:27.120
<i>...of the church on Ruby Road
comes to an end.</i>

52:29.480 --> 52:33.040
<i>With a very happy ending
for little Ruby Sunday.</i>

52:38.400 --> 52:40.880
But life goes on, doesn't it?

52:40.880 --> 52:42.240
Ruthlessly.

52:42.840 --> 52:45.240
And what happens, you might wonder,

52:45.240 --> 52:48.800
oh, what happens to
that mysterious traveller

52:48.800 --> 52:52.000
in time and space known as the Doctor?

52:53.440 --> 52:56.920
I'm sorry to say,
his story ends in absolute terror.

52:59.840 --> 53:01.120
Night night.
