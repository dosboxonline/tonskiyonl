00:56.826 --> 01:00.242
Remember when they let
commercial airlines land in this town?

01:00.329 --> 01:02.571
I don't understand where we're going...

01:02.665 --> 01:04.822
...or why we're bothering anyhow.

01:05.001 --> 01:08.037
- You're doing a good deed.
- Give us a better reason.

01:08.463 --> 01:12.294
A maniac hijacked a municipal bus
with 30 passengers on it.

01:12.758 --> 01:16.258
I got a hunch where those passengers are
and who that maniac is.

01:16.345 --> 01:17.756
Share it with us.

01:18.389 --> 01:19.420
Phoenix.

01:20.016 --> 01:21.261
Simon Phoenix.

01:58.512 --> 02:00.552
Send a maniac to catch one.

02:02.891 --> 02:03.887
Phoenix!

03:16.548 --> 03:18.291
Don't move, Phoenix.

03:21.886 --> 03:23.428
You're under arrest.

03:24.097 --> 03:25.639
Arrest? Shit.

03:26.432 --> 03:28.140
And you're trespassing.

03:29.477 --> 03:30.888
Where are the passengers?

03:30.978 --> 03:33.018
Oh, yes, the passengers.

03:33.189 --> 03:34.731
Well, they're...

03:35.817 --> 03:37.062
Fuck you.

03:37.151 --> 03:39.025
The passengers are gone.

03:39.487 --> 03:42.986
See, I told the city,
"Look, nobody comes down here."

03:43.616 --> 03:45.324
Postmen figured it out...

03:45.493 --> 03:47.070
...policemen figured it out.

03:47.161 --> 03:50.447
But the goddamn bus drivers
just wouldn't listen.

03:51.082 --> 03:52.873
Last time, Phoenix.

03:53.251 --> 03:55.243
Where are the hostages?

03:55.378 --> 03:58.628
To hell with the hostages!.
This is between you and me!.

04:03.511 --> 04:04.590
What you got?

04:04.678 --> 04:05.758
Do something.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.127
Go ahead.

04:08.099 --> 04:10.257
You're up to your ass in gasoline.

04:13.646 --> 04:15.519
I'll set your ass on fire.

04:28.661 --> 04:30.238
Is it cold in here...

04:30.996 --> 04:32.538
...or is it just me?

05:04.780 --> 05:06.238
Where are they, Phoenix?

05:06.323 --> 05:08.066
Now, where did I put them?

05:08.366 --> 05:11.617
I swear, I'd lose my head
if it wasn't attached.

05:12.954 --> 05:14.947
I'll keep that in mind.

05:56.497 --> 05:59.664
Damn it, I'm tired
of this "demolition-man" shit!

06:00.126 --> 06:02.368
You were not supposed
to come down here!

06:02.462 --> 06:06.044
You were not supposed to attempt
the arrest of Phoenix alone...

06:06.299 --> 06:07.793
...or to blow anything up!

06:07.884 --> 06:11.050
It wasn't me! He dumped the gas
and rigged the place to blow!

06:11.137 --> 06:12.797
Right, you weren't involved.

06:12.889 --> 06:15.510
I know you've tried
to nail this psycho for years.

06:15.600 --> 06:17.557
But remember a thing called...

06:17.727 --> 06:19.470
...official police procedure?

06:19.562 --> 06:21.519
- Where are the hostages?
- They're not here.

06:21.606 --> 06:22.305
What?

06:22.398 --> 06:24.307
He must've stashed them someplace else!

06:24.400 --> 06:26.274
Are you sure they weren't in there?

06:26.360 --> 06:29.895
I did a thermo check and there were eight
of them, all part of his gang.

06:29.989 --> 06:31.151
Wrong again!

06:31.324 --> 06:33.067
You got something to say?

06:33.993 --> 06:35.535
Get him out of here!

06:36.328 --> 06:37.360
Motherfucker!

06:37.455 --> 06:39.696
We are going to have a chat.

06:40.583 --> 06:41.578
Captain!

06:42.585 --> 06:45.040
Over here! There're bodies everywhere!

06:45.171 --> 06:46.713
There must be 20 or 30.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.291
They're everywhere.

06:49.675 --> 06:51.086
See that? I told him!

06:51.176 --> 06:53.003
He said he didn't care!

06:53.304 --> 06:57.052
How could you sacrifice
all those innocent people for me!

06:57.808 --> 06:59.599
What kind of man are you?

06:59.685 --> 07:03.018
We'll spend a lot of quality time together.
'Bye, sweetie!

07:03.105 --> 07:04.647
Honey! Sugar!

07:05.691 --> 07:08.016
If you got a lawyer, better call him.

08:04.374 --> 08:07.957
John Spartan, you've done great deeds
for Los Angeles.

08:08.420 --> 08:11.670
So, it is with some regret that I,
William Smithers...

08:11.798 --> 08:15.333
...acting as Assistant Warden,
hereby carry out this sentence.

08:15.593 --> 08:16.874
Skip it.

08:17.929 --> 08:20.087
You've been sentenced to 70 years...

08:20.181 --> 08:24.428
...sub-zero re-habilitation
in the California Cryo-Penitentiary...

08:24.727 --> 08:28.096
...for the involuntary manslaughter
of 30 civilians.

08:28.481 --> 08:29.644
Skip it.

08:29.774 --> 08:33.190
You'll be placed in cryo-stasis
for the duration of your sentence...

08:33.277 --> 08:36.812
...and your behavior will be altered
through synaptic suggestion.

08:36.905 --> 08:40.357
You'll be eligible for parole
no earlier than the year 2046.

08:49.293 --> 08:50.408
I'm sorry.

11:53.225 --> 11:54.554
All personnel...

11:54.643 --> 11:58.261
...the next scheduled parole hearing
for prisoner Gilmour...

11:58.397 --> 12:00.437
...will take place at 07:. 15.

12:01.734 --> 12:05.566
Warden William Smithers
report to Level A, conference room.

12:11.910 --> 12:13.321
Mellow greetings.

12:13.996 --> 12:16.534
Be well, Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.

12:17.416 --> 12:19.243
As it is a beautiful...

12:19.418 --> 12:23.118
...Monday morning and as my duty log
irrationally requires it...

12:23.297 --> 12:25.966
...I'm querying you
on the prison population.

12:26.049 --> 12:27.793
Does the tedium continue?

12:27.926 --> 12:30.631
Your question is amusing but irrelevant.

12:30.762 --> 12:33.432
The prisoners are ice cubes.
They never move.

12:34.141 --> 12:37.225
I find this lack of stimulus
to be truly disappointing.

12:37.311 --> 12:39.054
- Don't you think?
- I try not to.

12:39.146 --> 12:41.471
You're young, think all you want.

12:41.648 --> 12:44.684
Things don't happen anymore,
we've taken care of all that.

12:44.776 --> 12:47.611
I'll fiber-op you back
after the parole hearings.

12:47.696 --> 12:49.273
Have a peachy day.

12:49.448 --> 12:50.479
Be well.

12:50.657 --> 12:51.522
Be well.

12:51.616 --> 12:53.027
Vector 137.

12:53.118 --> 12:55.609
Upcoming, Santa Monica Boulevard.

13:00.834 --> 13:02.542
Retina coding accepted.

13:02.711 --> 13:04.787
Warden Smithers, be well.

13:05.213 --> 13:06.292
Go on.

13:14.389 --> 13:15.468
Self-drive on.

13:15.557 --> 13:17.348
Self-drive engaged.

13:17.725 --> 13:19.101
Coding on.

13:19.394 --> 13:23.142
No police presence is requested
in the city at this time.

13:23.314 --> 13:24.477
Report to the station.

13:24.566 --> 13:26.475
Oh, boy, how exciting.

14:02.228 --> 14:03.224
That's it.

14:03.312 --> 14:05.139
"Food, glorious food."

14:05.856 --> 14:07.267
There'll be another in 12 hours.

14:07.358 --> 14:09.730
These assholes are predictable.

14:10.111 --> 14:11.653
God, I hate this place!

14:11.737 --> 14:13.397
There's not enough of us, Friendly.

14:13.489 --> 14:15.482
That doesn't really matter anymore.

14:15.574 --> 14:16.950
People are hungry.

14:17.034 --> 14:18.943
We've nothing to lose.

14:32.800 --> 14:34.128
Greetings.

14:34.301 --> 14:35.843
Lovely Lenina.

14:37.763 --> 14:41.262
Greetings, welcome
to the emergency line of the SAPD.

14:42.142 --> 14:45.143
If you prefer an automated response,
press one now.

14:45.312 --> 14:46.593
Be well.

14:49.983 --> 14:51.976
Mellow greetings, Lenina Huxley.

14:52.069 --> 14:54.061
Let me guess, all is serene?

14:54.279 --> 14:57.066
On the contrary, it's been a horrific a. m.

14:57.491 --> 14:59.649
Public buildings were defaced.

14:59.826 --> 15:01.700
Walls smudged with...

15:02.162 --> 15:03.822
...scandalous graffiti.

15:03.914 --> 15:04.993
Really?

15:05.165 --> 15:08.119
Brutal. Why wasn't there
an "all-cars notify"?

15:08.335 --> 15:11.834
Because there was no need
to create widespread panic.

15:12.923 --> 15:14.666
Lieutenant Huxley...

15:14.841 --> 15:17.842
...I monitored your disheartening
and distressing comments...

15:17.928 --> 15:19.837
...to the warden this morning.

15:19.930 --> 15:22.931
Do you really long for chaos
and disharmony?

15:23.809 --> 15:27.557
Your fascination with the 20th century
is affecting your judgment.

15:28.522 --> 15:32.436
You realize you're setting a bad example
for other officers and personnel.

15:32.525 --> 15:35.195
Thank you for the attitude readjustment.

15:35.362 --> 15:37.070
Info assimilated.

15:44.871 --> 15:46.531
Sanctimonious asshole.

15:46.706 --> 15:49.375
Lenina Huxley, you are fined 1/2 credit...

15:49.459 --> 15:52.543
...for a 'sotto voce' violation
of the verbal-morality statute.

15:52.629 --> 15:54.004
Thank you.

16:01.054 --> 16:02.382
That was tense.

16:02.722 --> 16:04.300
That was tense?

16:06.392 --> 16:10.722
Don't you get bored code tracing perps
who break curfew and tell dirty jokes?

16:11.189 --> 16:13.265
I find my job deeply fulfilling.

16:14.067 --> 16:17.732
I just can't get over the reality
of this office, Lenina.

16:18.237 --> 16:20.693
You're still addicted to the 20th century.

16:20.782 --> 16:24.067
High from its harshness.
Buzzed by its brutality.

16:24.494 --> 16:25.952
Holy smokes!

16:26.579 --> 16:30.826
Is there anything in this office which
doesn't violate Contraband Ordinance 22?

16:30.917 --> 16:32.245
Only you.

16:33.878 --> 16:36.369
Don't you ever want something to happen?

16:37.590 --> 16:38.870
Goodness, no.

16:39.675 --> 16:41.419
I knew you'd say that.

16:44.263 --> 16:46.421
What I wouldn't give for some action.

16:57.234 --> 16:58.978
Mr. Simon Phoenix.

17:00.196 --> 17:02.900
One of our first
and most illustrious members.

17:04.282 --> 17:05.445
Allow me...

17:05.576 --> 17:08.445
...to welcome you to your parole hearing.

17:08.829 --> 17:10.738
Let's get this over quickly.

17:13.751 --> 17:17.583
Twenty-nine years ago,
the parole system, as you know it...

17:19.589 --> 17:21.665
...was rendered obsolete.

17:23.594 --> 17:25.717
Federal Statute 537-29...

17:30.100 --> 17:31.131
Stop it!

17:34.730 --> 17:37.600
Do you have anything fresh to say
on your behalf?

17:41.278 --> 17:42.606
I thought not.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.279
Yeah.

17:46.491 --> 17:47.654
I do.

17:48.618 --> 17:49.781
Teddy bear.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.463
How'd you know the password?

18:09.723 --> 18:11.217
I wish I knew.

18:11.308 --> 18:12.968
Simon says:. die.

18:31.494 --> 18:32.657
Warden...

18:33.329 --> 18:35.369
...let's get this over quickly.

18:42.547 --> 18:45.797

Warden William Smithers.

18:47.051 --> 18:48.047

19:05.444 --> 19:06.689
Oh, my!

19:08.531 --> 19:10.274
I don't believe it!

19:10.616 --> 19:12.692
Northwest quadrant. 187.

19:14.370 --> 19:15.864
What's a 187?

19:16.038 --> 19:17.283
I don't know.

- Who?

20:55.887 --> 20:57.429
Simon Phoenix.

21:00.558 --> 21:01.934
I knew him.

21:02.018 --> 21:04.972
He's evil in a way you've never read about.

21:05.271 --> 21:08.474
He's a criminal the likes
of which you've never seen.

21:08.650 --> 21:10.393
Hold that thought.

21:12.779 --> 21:14.059

21:23.748 --> 21:25.242
Phoenix isn't coded.

21:25.333 --> 21:27.409
He was chilled in the 20th...

21:27.585 --> 21:29.791
...before they started lo-jacking everybody.

21:29.879 --> 21:32.963
Declared his own kingdom
in South Central LA.

21:33.174 --> 21:34.502
In a bad time...

21:35.009 --> 21:37.582
- ... he was the worst.
- Emergency, code 187.

21:38.179 --> 21:40.006
Emergency, code 187.

21:42.016 --> 21:43.640
Locating stopped code.

21:43.851 --> 21:46.259
MurderDeathKill. MurderDeathKill.

21:47.146 --> 21:48.142
Location...

21:48.230 --> 21:51.813
...Cryo-prison, parking area.
Cryo-prison, Level 6...

21:53.360 --> 21:55.353
Main cryo-prison parking zone.

21:55.488 --> 21:57.112
Enhancing image.

21:57.448 --> 21:59.239
Tracking Dr. Mostow.

21:59.575 --> 22:01.117
187, deceased.

22:02.995 --> 22:05.201
Do you wish to assign a coroner?

22:06.874 --> 22:08.866
Is the doctor's car still in the lot?

22:08.959 --> 22:11.331
The answer is no. Car missing.

22:13.172 --> 22:17.039
Doctor's conveyance is not
in parking zone. It is in motion.

22:19.386 --> 22:21.960
Locate precise code-fix
on doctor's conveyance.

22:22.056 --> 22:24.463
Fixing location. Beverly Hills.

22:24.767 --> 22:25.965
Robertson.

22:26.143 --> 22:27.388
Doheny.

22:27.644 --> 22:29.187
Beverly Drive.

22:30.814 --> 22:33.056
Vehicle has been code-fixed...

22:33.317 --> 22:37.314
...approaching the corner of Wilshire
and Santa Monica Boulevard.

22:38.155 --> 22:39.483
Glorious.

22:41.658 --> 22:43.034
Fine work.

22:43.285 --> 22:45.610
All nearby units, ProtectServe...

22:45.829 --> 22:47.987
...Wilshire and Santa Monica.

22:48.457 --> 22:51.161
- Unit 12 ProtectServe.
- Apprehend fugitive.

22:51.293 --> 22:53.332
Proceed with extreme assertiveness.

22:53.420 --> 22:55.911
Doctor's vehicle has been code-fixed.

22:56.006 --> 23:00.003
Approaching the corner of Wilshire
and Santa Monica Boulevard.

23:20.030 --> 23:23.114
Lately I just don't feel like
there's anything special about me.

23:23.199 --> 23:25.773
You are an incredibly sensitive man...

23:25.910 --> 23:29.659
...who inspires joy-joy feelings
in all those around you.

23:31.499 --> 23:33.622
- Get out of here!
- Excuse me.

23:34.502 --> 23:35.878
I'm sorry.

23:37.755 --> 23:41.255
Greetings, Citizen! How are you feeling
on this glorious day?

23:43.761 --> 23:45.635
You look great today!

23:48.766 --> 23:50.426
I feel good too.

23:50.810 --> 23:53.977
Angeles Information Network.
Automated banking.

23:55.148 --> 23:56.891
Damn, I'm possessed.

23:57.066 --> 23:59.557
I wonder if I can play the accordion too.

24:00.570 --> 24:02.361
File code accepted.

24:03.239 --> 24:05.647
Friendly, Edgar. Code level 60.

24:06.159 --> 24:08.650
Listed offenses: civil unrest...

24:08.744 --> 24:12.528
Don't you hear a thought repeating
in that brain of yours?

24:13.082 --> 24:15.158
The name Friendly, Edgar?

24:15.293 --> 24:16.870
Edgar Friendly.

24:18.087 --> 24:20.245
Don't you have a job to do?

24:20.589 --> 24:22.748
Don't you have someone to kill?

24:24.010 --> 24:25.669
Someone to kill.

24:26.178 --> 24:27.838
Someone to kill.

24:43.028 --> 24:45.400
"Gun, " noun. Portable firearm.

24:46.198 --> 24:50.860
This device was widely utilized
in the urban wars of the late 20th century.

24:51.036 --> 24:52.828
Referred to as a "pistol."

24:52.913 --> 24:56.697
I don't need a history lesson.
Where are the goddamn guns?

24:57.918 --> 25:02.461
You are fined one credit for a violation
of the verbal-morality statute.

25:02.548 --> 25:03.876
Fuck you.

25:04.716 --> 25:08.548
Your repeated violation
has caused me to notify the police.

25:10.472 --> 25:13.141
Please remain where you are
for your reprimand.

25:13.225 --> 25:14.684
Yeah, right.

25:19.815 --> 25:21.558
The fuckers are fast too.

25:21.650 --> 25:25.897
You are fined one credit for violation
of the verbal-morality statute.

25:26.988 --> 25:28.898
ProtectServe in place.

25:29.074 --> 25:31.316
Four minutes, fifteen seconds lapse.

25:33.370 --> 25:35.908
Maniac is imminent. Request advice.

25:36.164 --> 25:37.742
With a firm tone of voice...

25:37.833 --> 25:41.118
...demand maniac lie down
with hands behind back.

25:44.089 --> 25:45.631
Simon Phoenix!

25:46.091 --> 25:49.008
Lie down with your hands
behind your back!

25:50.053 --> 25:51.251
What's this?

25:51.429 --> 25:53.801
Six of you. Such nice, tidy uniforms.

25:54.599 --> 25:56.342
Oh, I'm so scared.

25:58.186 --> 26:00.594
You guys don't have sarcasm any more?

26:02.357 --> 26:04.349
Maniac responded scornfully.

26:04.943 --> 26:08.940
Approach and repeat ultimatum
in an even firmer tone of voice.

26:09.280 --> 26:11.356
Add the words: "or else."

26:14.410 --> 26:16.486
Lie down on the ground...

26:17.372 --> 26:18.782
...or else!

26:30.134 --> 26:32.341
Anti-Graffiti Activation Program...

26:32.470 --> 26:33.585
...activated.

26:33.679 --> 26:34.675
Aborted.

26:34.764 --> 26:36.803
Human presence detected.

26:37.391 --> 26:39.717
Safety override code accepted.

26:40.144 --> 26:41.722
Lucky number seven.

26:58.871 --> 27:00.246
We're police officers!

27:00.331 --> 27:03.248
We're not trained to handle this kind
of violence!

27:10.674 --> 27:12.003
Wait for me!

27:34.448 --> 27:35.646
Stupid.

27:49.421 --> 27:51.579
Simon says: everybody sing!

27:54.092 --> 27:55.586
"And the home

27:56.428 --> 27:57.970
"Of the brave "

28:00.057 --> 28:01.432
Play ball!

28:09.524 --> 28:11.932
We've lost every camera for six blocks.

28:13.945 --> 28:16.401
Go to Century City, 1200 millimeters.

28:24.539 --> 28:27.112
He's going for the vehicle's battery coil.

28:27.751 --> 28:29.542
It's pure capacitance gel.

28:39.762 --> 28:42.799
The problem is not the defacement
of public buildings or...

28:42.891 --> 28:46.390
...the noise pollution caused
by the exploding devices.

28:46.519 --> 28:48.144
Allow me to explain.

28:48.730 --> 28:51.766
The real problem lies
in the man whose initials...

28:52.025 --> 28:54.266
...mark the detonating graffiti...

28:54.736 --> 28:57.227
...on the streets of our peaceful city.

28:57.613 --> 28:59.571
The man behind the "E.F."...

29:00.658 --> 29:02.366
...Mr. Edgar Friendly.

29:04.412 --> 29:06.903
For a sadly extended period of time...

29:07.248 --> 29:08.991
...we in San Angeles...

29:09.083 --> 29:12.452
...have been plagued by a pack
of subterranean hooligans.

29:13.963 --> 29:16.454
You will come to know them as "scraps."

29:16.591 --> 29:20.339
Men and women who have left the comfort
of our society...

29:20.595 --> 29:22.338
...only to spew hostility...

29:22.430 --> 29:25.431
...at the very bosom
they have relinquished.

29:25.725 --> 29:29.307
There was a time when we used
to look upon these scraps...

29:29.478 --> 29:32.313
...as rather pathetic
and relatively harmless.

29:33.315 --> 29:35.059
Now they have a leader.

29:35.484 --> 29:38.402
Mr. Friendly seems relentless
in his ambition...

29:38.487 --> 29:41.358
...to infect our harmony with his venom.

29:41.991 --> 29:43.734
He must, of course...

29:43.951 --> 29:45.326
...be stopped.

29:46.120 --> 29:49.453
This radical terrorist behavior,
led by Mr. Friendly...

29:49.540 --> 29:52.410
...must not be allowed
to undermine our safety.

29:55.129 --> 29:56.623
"Safety Above All."

29:57.673 --> 30:00.460
I expect your trust,
confidence and certitude.

30:01.802 --> 30:03.000
Excuse me.

30:06.306 --> 30:07.551
Dr. Cocteau...

30:07.724 --> 30:11.508
...a cryo-con has effected self-release
from the penitentiary.

30:12.020 --> 30:16.148
It's quite horrific. MurderDeathKills,
all categories of chaos.

30:16.358 --> 30:17.817
Enhance your calm.

30:22.447 --> 30:24.107
"Be well" them for me.

30:29.037 --> 30:31.824
Get me Captain George Earle immediately.

30:34.042 --> 30:35.453
It was just...

30:36.878 --> 30:38.123
It was so...

30:39.714 --> 30:42.122
How can a man be so blatantly sadistic?

30:42.300 --> 30:44.044
It was fun for him.

30:44.553 --> 30:48.550
Do everything in your power
to snare this agent of destruction.

30:48.723 --> 30:50.799
You have my utmost confidence.

30:52.060 --> 30:54.017
It will be done, Dr. Cocteau.

30:55.563 --> 30:56.559
Be well.

31:01.403 --> 31:03.229
"Utmost confidence."

31:04.572 --> 31:06.482
"Everything in our power."

31:10.495 --> 31:11.989
What else is there?

31:13.414 --> 31:14.873
Zachary Lamb...

31:15.375 --> 31:19.324
...how was the fiendish Phoenix
apprehended back in the 20th?

31:20.088 --> 31:21.961
Twelve-state manhunt.

31:22.298 --> 31:24.291
Satellite surveillance.

31:24.926 --> 31:27.499
A video bite on Unsolved Mysteries.

31:28.346 --> 31:30.173
None of them worked.

31:30.723 --> 31:32.930
In the end, it took just one man.

31:33.101 --> 31:34.381
One cop.

31:35.353 --> 31:36.847
John Spartan.

31:37.397 --> 31:38.476
John Spartan?

31:38.564 --> 31:40.023
That's right.

31:40.233 --> 31:42.724
They called him the "Demolition Man."

31:43.194 --> 31:45.270
Spartan file 98345, LAPD.

31:48.074 --> 31:50.197
Spartan file 98761C, LAPD.

31:55.039 --> 31:57.364
Are you sure this is real life?

31:57.541 --> 31:58.786
Barely.

31:59.043 --> 32:00.323
Spartan's a legend.

32:00.419 --> 32:04.583
I've been doing a historical study.
Over 1,000 arrests over three years.

32:04.757 --> 32:06.796
All authentic criminals.

32:07.134 --> 32:09.423
There was a lot more business back then.

32:09.512 --> 32:12.631
How can you justify
destroying a $7 million mini mall...

32:12.723 --> 32:15.558
...to rescue a girl
whose ransom is only $25,000?

32:15.643 --> 32:17.053
Fuck you, lady.

32:17.394 --> 32:18.723
Good answer.

32:19.813 --> 32:21.889
This is your recommendation?

32:22.066 --> 32:24.307
The Demolition Man's an animal.

32:24.652 --> 32:29.064
He's clearly the man for a job such as this.
You could reinstate him.

32:29.740 --> 32:31.816
He's a muscle-bound grotesque...

32:32.743 --> 32:35.234
...who hasn't worn a shield in 40 years.

32:35.412 --> 32:38.330
Simon Phoenix is an old-fashioned criminal.

32:38.499 --> 32:40.408
We need an old-fashioned cop.

33:04.983 --> 33:08.601
Cryo-fac 312-618 is ready
for routine maintenance and inspection.

33:29.132 --> 33:30.923
John Spartan, 5864.

33:32.135 --> 33:34.804
Pulmonary activity approaching normal.

33:34.971 --> 33:37.462
Body temperature, 63% and rising.

33:39.142 --> 33:40.802
Biolink engaged.

33:41.895 --> 33:44.564
Laser defibrillation sequence started.

33:45.482 --> 33:47.807
Plasma transfer in 15 seconds.

33:49.736 --> 33:52.061
Plasma transfer, 10 seconds...

33:52.655 --> 33:53.984
...8 seconds...

33:54.574 --> 33:55.902
...6 seconds...

33:57.493 --> 33:59.569
Plasma transfer complete.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.241
MTL complete.

34:23.185 --> 34:25.344
Hunting down an escaped cryo-con...

34:25.688 --> 34:27.597
...by releasing another one?

34:28.107 --> 34:29.601
I am unconvinced.

34:29.775 --> 34:32.183
It's within the powers of the police charter.

34:32.277 --> 34:36.110
He can be released on limited parole
and reinstated to active duty.

34:36.282 --> 34:38.902
It's not enough to collect the '90s?

34:39.201 --> 34:41.692
Cocteau said everything in our power.

34:41.786 --> 34:43.364
I can't think of a better idea.

34:43.456 --> 34:45.614
That doesn't mean it's a good one.

34:47.126 --> 34:50.791
This man comes from a dissimilar method
of law enforcement.

34:50.963 --> 34:54.213
I'm not sure he's any different
than Simon Phoenix himself.

34:54.300 --> 34:55.414
Detective?

34:58.387 --> 35:00.712
I am Lieutenant Lenina Huxley.

35:01.390 --> 35:03.098
The year is 2032.

35:04.143 --> 35:06.634
The reason you have been released is...

35:06.812 --> 35:08.639
How long have I been under?

35:10.899 --> 35:12.310
Thirty-six years.

35:15.487 --> 35:16.981
I had a wife.

35:17.447 --> 35:19.321
What happened to my wife?

35:20.742 --> 35:24.028
Her light was extinguished
in the Big One of 2010.

35:29.251 --> 35:30.579
She died.

35:31.586 --> 35:33.294
In an earthquake.

35:33.839 --> 35:35.416
The earthquake.

35:38.009 --> 35:39.504
I had a daughter.

35:41.263 --> 35:42.757
What happened to her?

35:42.848 --> 35:43.927
John Spartan.

35:44.015 --> 35:46.174
I am Chief of Police George Earle.

35:46.268 --> 35:48.937
We didn't thaw you out
for a family reunion.

35:49.688 --> 35:53.935
Consider it fortunate that the lieutenant
did a probe on your wife.

35:54.109 --> 35:56.778
This is about you
and the cryo-con Simon Phoenix.

35:56.861 --> 35:57.941
What?

35:58.363 --> 36:02.776
Today Simon Phoenix escaped from
this cryo-facility. We've had 11 murders...

36:02.951 --> 36:04.030
...so far.

36:05.036 --> 36:08.286
You see, we've become a society
of peace-loving...

36:08.456 --> 36:11.872
...and understanding and we are,
quite frankly, not equipped...

36:11.960 --> 36:13.620
...to deal with this situation.

36:13.711 --> 36:17.709
There's been no deaths of unnatural causes
in San Angeles for 16 years.

36:17.882 --> 36:18.961
Where?

36:19.133 --> 36:23.427
The Santa Barbara, Los Angeles,
San Diego Metroplex merged in 2011.

36:23.638 --> 36:25.677
You are in what used to be LA.

36:27.308 --> 36:28.553
That's great.

36:30.061 --> 36:32.552
- You, get me a Marlboro.
- Yes, of course.

36:34.482 --> 36:35.810
What's a Marlboro?

36:35.900 --> 36:38.058
It's a cigarette. Any cigarette.

36:39.404 --> 36:43.401
Smoking is not good for you.
Anything not good for you is bad.

36:44.242 --> 36:48.026
Hence, illegal. Alcohol, caffeine,
contact sports, meat...

36:48.246 --> 36:49.656
Are you shitting me?

36:49.747 --> 36:54.208
You are fined one credit for violation
of the verbal-morality statute.

36:55.169 --> 36:57.078
What the hell is that?

36:57.255 --> 37:00.172
- You are fined one credit...
- Bad language...

37:00.341 --> 37:03.924
...chocolate, gasoline, uneducational toys
and spicy food.

37:04.095 --> 37:07.760
Abortion is illegal, so is pregnancy
if you don't have a license.

37:07.848 --> 37:08.963
Caveman...

37:09.100 --> 37:12.184
...let's finish with the Rip Van Winkle
and get moving.

37:12.269 --> 37:14.760
Our Mr. Phoenix has risen from the ashes.

37:16.857 --> 37:19.182
I tracked that dirtbag for two years...

37:19.276 --> 37:23.191
...and when I finally bring him down
you turn me into an ice cube.

37:23.614 --> 37:25.192
Thanks, but no thanks.

37:25.366 --> 37:28.865
The conditions of your parole
are full reinstatement into the SAPD...

37:28.953 --> 37:32.368
...and immediate assignment
to the apprehension of Phoenix.

37:32.539 --> 37:33.535
Or...

37:35.459 --> 37:37.950
...you can go back into cryo-stasis.

37:38.295 --> 37:41.213
Not many people get a second chance,
John Spartan.

37:50.098 --> 37:52.424
Any new inforama on Simon Phoenix?

37:52.601 --> 37:55.009
There is nothing, Lenina Huxley.

37:55.729 --> 37:57.104
Where's Spartan?

37:57.606 --> 38:01.189
He went to the bathroom.
I guess he got all thawed out.

38:05.405 --> 38:07.647
I formally convey my presence.

38:10.118 --> 38:11.577
How are you doing?

38:11.953 --> 38:14.623
We're not used
to physical-contact greetings.

38:15.207 --> 38:16.452
I don't know...

38:16.541 --> 38:18.450
...if you guys know it but...

38:19.544 --> 38:21.537
...you're out of toilet paper.

38:22.964 --> 38:24.791
Did you say "toilet paper"?

38:26.801 --> 38:29.506
They used handfuls of wadded paper...

38:29.888 --> 38:31.715
...back in the 20th.

38:34.142 --> 38:37.641
I'm happy you're happy,
but in place of toilet paper...

38:37.812 --> 38:40.482
...you've got a shelf with three seashells.

38:41.900 --> 38:44.569
He doesn't know how to use the seashells.

38:48.907 --> 38:50.484
I can see how that'd be confusing.

38:50.575 --> 38:53.148
I don't believe it. Is that you, Spartan?

38:58.666 --> 39:00.042
Zach Lamb?

39:01.252 --> 39:02.830
What happened to you?

39:04.088 --> 39:05.547
I got older.

39:06.007 --> 39:08.580
My God, I remember when you were...

39:09.010 --> 39:10.290
...a rookie pilot.

39:10.386 --> 39:12.343
They finally grounded me.

39:12.513 --> 39:15.004
Shit, you were a damn good flyer.

39:15.558 --> 39:20.019
You're fined two credits for violation
of the verbal-morality statute.

39:20.354 --> 39:22.146
I'll be right back.

39:22.482 --> 39:24.141
They seem to be friends, yet...

39:24.233 --> 39:26.641
...he speaks to him
in the most profane manner.

39:26.736 --> 39:31.232
If you'd read my study, you'd know
this is how heterosexual men bonded.

39:31.574 --> 39:33.033
I knew that.

39:33.367 --> 39:37.447
Thanks a lot you shit-brained,
fuck-faced, ball-breaking, duck-fucking...

39:38.748 --> 39:41.286
- ... pain in the ass.
- You're fined five credits...

39:41.375 --> 39:44.127
...for repeated violations
of the verbal-morality statute.

39:44.211 --> 39:46.038
So much for the seashells.

39:46.464 --> 39:48.540
See you in a few minutes.

39:52.386 --> 39:54.544
Voice check, Lenina Huxley.

39:54.889 --> 39:57.558
Unfortunately Simon Phoenix
was not coded.

39:57.641 --> 40:00.476
While you were sleeping
a code was installed on everyone.

40:00.561 --> 40:04.641
It was a brilliant idea by Dr. Cocteau.
An organic microchip...

40:04.898 --> 40:06.143
...is sewn into the skin.

40:06.233 --> 40:09.483
Sensors all over the city
can zero in on anyone at any time.

40:09.570 --> 40:13.402
I can't even conceive of what
police officers did before it was developed.

40:13.490 --> 40:16.610
We worked. This fascist crap
makes me want to puke.

40:16.785 --> 40:19.027
What do you think you're scratching?

40:19.663 --> 40:22.415
You really think we'd let you go
without control?

40:22.499 --> 40:24.907
Your code was implanted
when you were thawed.

40:25.002 --> 40:27.493
Why not just shove a leash up my ass?

40:27.838 --> 40:29.498
You dirty meat-eater!

40:30.299 --> 40:32.422
No matter how Viking your era was...

40:32.509 --> 40:35.545
...I cannot digest how
you ever wore a badge!

40:35.679 --> 40:38.633
You're going back, John Spartan,
you're going back!

40:38.724 --> 40:41.511
Could you two please
dump some hormones?

40:41.768 --> 40:43.927
We need every cortex we can get here.

40:44.020 --> 40:45.930
We don't need the Neanderthal.

40:46.022 --> 40:48.858
Our computer has already examined
every scenario...

40:48.942 --> 40:51.480
...resulting from the appearance
of Simon Phoenix.

40:51.570 --> 40:55.519
It's determined he'll try to set up
a drug lab and form a crime syndicate.

40:55.615 --> 40:57.275
That is correct.

40:58.285 --> 41:00.277
I hate to interrupt you two...

41:00.412 --> 41:02.120
...but that's fucking stupid.

41:02.205 --> 41:04.494
You think he wants to start a business?

41:04.583 --> 41:06.492
Phoenix is going for a gun.

41:06.626 --> 41:08.120
Plain and simple.

41:08.712 --> 41:09.957
Trust me.

41:10.296 --> 41:11.495
He's going for a gun.

41:11.589 --> 41:13.962
Who cares what this primate thinks?

41:14.259 --> 41:16.050
Resonate some understanding.

41:16.136 --> 41:19.635
The only place a person
can even view a gun in this city...

41:20.348 --> 41:21.890
...is at a museum.

41:28.273 --> 41:31.357
Welcome to the San Angeles Museum
of History.

41:32.151 --> 41:34.440
Beneath you is an excavation...

41:34.529 --> 41:37.530
...of an actual 20th-century street scene...

41:37.824 --> 41:41.608
...in downtown Los Angeles,
preserved since the earthquake of 2010.

41:43.746 --> 41:47.578
For specific information
on objects featured in the exhibit...

41:47.834 --> 41:50.372
Firearms are displayed in the Armory...

41:50.586 --> 41:52.496
...located on Level A.

41:54.966 --> 41:57.717
You are entering the Hall of Violence...

41:57.885 --> 42:01.586
...a visual representation
of the primitive behavior prevalent...

42:01.764 --> 42:04.172
...during the late 20th century.

42:04.850 --> 42:06.558
Home, sweet home.

42:10.272 --> 42:14.769
John Spartan, even if Simon Phoenix
was able to locate the cache of firearms...

42:14.944 --> 42:17.067
...it'd be impossible to remove them.

42:17.154 --> 42:20.855
She's right. They're located
in a maximum-security armory exhibit.

42:20.950 --> 42:23.357
It's just a hunch. Trust me on this.

42:23.619 --> 42:25.030
It's a cop thing.

42:25.204 --> 42:26.828
And what am I, a frog?

42:28.999 --> 42:30.375
Excuse me.

42:30.668 --> 42:31.996
I'll drive.

42:36.507 --> 42:39.294
Resetting all bio-links for new driver.

42:39.551 --> 42:41.924
Weight, height, peripheral vision set.

42:42.304 --> 42:43.964
If you would like...

42:44.139 --> 42:48.552
...to commence transportation,
John Spartan, initialize sequence now.

42:49.019 --> 42:50.394
You drive.

42:55.692 --> 42:57.685
Welcome, Lenina Huxley.

43:09.039 --> 43:12.159
You seem very much alone,
John Spartan, but...

43:12.334 --> 43:14.576
...things aren't all that different.

43:14.670 --> 43:17.077
Perhaps you'd like to hear
an oldies station?

43:17.172 --> 43:19.211
"Oh, what a relief it is."

43:19.508 --> 43:21.666
This is the town's most popular station.

43:21.760 --> 43:24.429
Wall-to-wall mini-tunes.
You called them "commercials."

43:24.513 --> 43:26.671
The classic you've been waiting for.

43:26.765 --> 43:29.682
The number one request:
"Armour Hot Dogs."

43:30.519 --> 43:32.511
"Kids eat Armour Hot Dogs..."

43:32.729 --> 43:34.389
This is my fave!

43:34.856 --> 43:36.979
"Skinny kids, kids who climb on rocks

43:37.067 --> 43:39.937
"Tall kids, sissy kids, even kids with...

43:40.195 --> 43:41.855
"... chicken pox love hot dogs

43:41.946 --> 43:43.606
"Armour Hot Dogs

43:44.074 --> 43:46.362
"The dogs kids love to bite."

43:53.374 --> 43:55.912
Someone put me back in the fridge.

43:58.087 --> 44:00.709
You are entering the armory exhibit.

44:01.257 --> 44:04.507
Here you will find displays
in the cabinets and walls...

44:04.594 --> 44:07.001
So sorry. Didn't see you there.

44:09.098 --> 44:10.509
Sweet baby.

44:12.977 --> 44:14.258
Oh, shit.

44:23.780 --> 44:25.772
This is what I'm talking about.

44:26.282 --> 44:27.860
How do I get in here?

44:28.284 --> 44:32.234
Is there a 15-day waiting period?
Or can I just take one now?

44:33.998 --> 44:35.492
Motherfucker.

44:41.422 --> 44:42.881
Oh, fuck it.

44:43.299 --> 44:44.710
Mellow greetings.

44:45.092 --> 44:46.919
What seems to be your boggle?

44:47.011 --> 44:48.386
My "boggle"?

44:54.018 --> 44:55.642
How much do you weigh?

44:56.145 --> 44:57.260
I weigh...

45:04.653 --> 45:07.191
Please vacate the museum, patrons.

45:07.656 --> 45:08.687
Be calm.

45:09.408 --> 45:11.068
Please vacate...

45:11.327 --> 45:13.699
...the museum, patrons. Be calm.

45:13.871 --> 45:16.409
Wait a minute, this is the future.

45:16.540 --> 45:18.580
Where are all the phaser guns?

45:23.839 --> 45:25.417
Mellow greetings, sir.

45:25.507 --> 45:27.167
What's your boggle?

45:33.807 --> 45:35.966
Warning, please exit rapidly.

45:36.059 --> 45:39.594
The magnetic accelerator gun,
the last hand-held weapon...

45:39.688 --> 45:42.808
...of this millennium,
displaced the flow of neutrons...

45:42.899 --> 45:46.482
...through a nonlinear cycloid
electromagnetic accumulator.

45:46.820 --> 45:48.611
So, what? It needs batteries?

45:48.697 --> 45:51.864
What size? Where the fuck
do you find batteries?

45:51.992 --> 45:53.866
Is there a battery store around here?

45:53.952 --> 45:55.861
Excuse me, patron. Can I...

45:58.206 --> 45:59.866
Where's Radio Shack?

46:06.214 --> 46:07.922
Sweet music to my ears.

46:08.258 --> 46:12.469
Activated, the magnetic accelerator gun
will achieve fusion in 2.6 minutes.

46:12.887 --> 46:16.885
I was thinking about leaving quickly.
Patience is not one of my virtues.

46:29.529 --> 46:30.904
Did you see that?

46:30.989 --> 46:31.984
What?

46:32.073 --> 46:35.359
Never mind. I give up trying
to figure this place out.

46:36.202 --> 46:38.693
Excuse me, Rambo. I need to borrow this.

46:43.918 --> 46:46.041
Access and correlate procedure.

46:46.212 --> 46:48.620
Establish communication with intruder.

46:48.756 --> 46:49.871
Wrong.

46:50.049 --> 46:52.967
- Luke Skywalker, use the Force.
- Oh, dear.

46:53.219 --> 46:56.339
- What the hell is this?
- It's a glow-rod. It's what we got.

46:56.431 --> 46:57.629
Does it work?

47:01.644 --> 47:02.889
Guess so.

47:03.062 --> 47:04.853
He's trapped in Section 8.

47:04.939 --> 47:07.145
I doubt it. Make sure the building's clear.

47:07.233 --> 47:08.692
Done. I want a visual.

47:08.776 --> 47:12.359
Every corridor of the museum,
I want full sensors routed to me.

47:15.157 --> 47:17.731
You guys wait here. Give me 10 minutes.

47:18.953 --> 47:22.286
Museum patron,
you are now confined to the armory.

47:25.167 --> 47:28.501
Museum patron, you are now confined
to the Armory.

47:34.468 --> 47:36.959
The armory exhibit is now sealed.

47:37.805 --> 47:41.719
All museum patrons still in the facility
should remain calm.

47:43.102 --> 47:44.810
Help is imminent.

47:48.691 --> 47:51.098
This museum is no longer sealed.

47:52.152 --> 47:54.441
What can I say? I'm a blast from the past.

47:54.530 --> 47:56.356
You should've stayed there.

47:56.615 --> 47:59.153
That voice sounds familiar. Who is that?

48:03.121 --> 48:04.829
Bad aim, Blondie.

48:04.998 --> 48:06.493
John Spartan?

48:06.833 --> 48:10.285
They let anybody into this century!
What're you doing here?

48:13.966 --> 48:15.424
Simon says:. bleed!

48:18.220 --> 48:19.797
Great. Just great.

48:19.930 --> 48:21.721
You're making it too easy.

48:21.848 --> 48:24.007
Come on, you piece of shit!

48:24.893 --> 48:26.304
Let me get this right.

48:26.394 --> 48:30.143
They defrosted you just
so you could lasso my piddly ass?

48:31.858 --> 48:34.645
I've dreamed about killing you for 40 years.

48:37.322 --> 48:38.864
Keep dreaming!

49:38.174 --> 49:40.166
Magnetic accelerator activated.

49:40.259 --> 49:41.504
About time.

49:41.594 --> 49:42.792
Past is over!

49:42.929 --> 49:44.636
Time for something new and improved!

49:44.722 --> 49:46.050
Oh, hell.

49:50.603 --> 49:52.430
Shit! I love this gun!

49:59.570 --> 50:01.444
How do you like the future?

50:13.417 --> 50:14.580
Come on!

50:22.634 --> 50:23.500
That must hurt!

50:23.594 --> 50:25.302
Huh, Soldier Boy?

50:26.889 --> 50:27.968
You're on TV!

50:28.056 --> 50:29.136
Shit!

50:36.523 --> 50:37.602
You're dead!

50:37.691 --> 50:39.648
Forgot to say:."Simon says."

50:44.781 --> 50:45.813
Oh, shit.

50:45.907 --> 50:47.236
Good one.

50:50.454 --> 50:52.197
Sorry, you must go!

50:52.331 --> 50:53.493
Shit!

51:23.778 --> 51:27.230
Our noble facility has been desecrated
by hooligans.

51:28.324 --> 51:30.815
Someone will pay dearly for this.

51:34.706 --> 51:38.834
Sir, the stress breeder is inside
being demobilized as we speak.

51:40.920 --> 51:44.040
Shit. Being frozen must've thrown
my aim off.

51:44.632 --> 51:47.040
I'll get you with the next shot.

51:48.845 --> 51:50.422
I don't think so.

51:52.598 --> 51:54.757
No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang.

51:56.227 --> 51:58.220
You were doing so well.

51:59.230 --> 52:01.388
Don't you have a job to do?

52:02.316 --> 52:05.935
Isn't there a thought repeating
in your barbaric brain?

52:06.612 --> 52:08.356
The name Friendly.

52:08.531 --> 52:10.322
Mr. Edgar Friendly.

52:10.825 --> 52:13.197
Don't you have someone to kill?

52:20.918 --> 52:22.911
- Yeah, I do.
- Excellent.

52:24.547 --> 52:26.539
Then go and do your job.

52:29.176 --> 52:30.090
Shit.

52:30.302 --> 52:32.046
Saved by the bell.

52:38.185 --> 52:39.348
Shit!

52:48.570 --> 52:49.733
Damn!

52:52.116 --> 52:54.274
You're lucky he didn't whack you.

52:54.618 --> 52:58.912
I must say that "whacking," whatever it is,
sounds most disagreeable.

52:59.790 --> 53:01.617
You scared him away.

53:01.750 --> 53:04.502
I don't know how to thank you.
You saved my life.

53:04.586 --> 53:05.997
No problem.

53:08.465 --> 53:10.588
Not bad for a 74-year-old.

53:11.343 --> 53:14.297
Simon Phoenix knows
he has some competition.

53:14.513 --> 53:16.671
He's finally matched his meat.

53:16.807 --> 53:18.930
You really licked his ass.

53:20.018 --> 53:21.845
That's "met his match"...

53:21.979 --> 53:24.018
...and "kicked his ass."

53:24.648 --> 53:27.221
"Met his match and kicked his ass."

53:28.193 --> 53:29.604
Captain Earle...

53:30.153 --> 53:31.813
Who is this man?

53:32.364 --> 53:36.693
John Spartan, temporarily reinstated
to the San Angeles Police Department...

53:36.868 --> 53:39.703
...to pursue the escaped cryo-con
Simon Phoenix.

53:41.039 --> 53:44.325
You told us to do everything
in our power to capture him.

53:44.543 --> 53:46.250
Yes, I did. I did.

53:46.586 --> 53:49.623
Yes, I do recall the exploits
of Mr. John Spartan.

53:50.674 --> 53:53.295
Yes, of course. The Demolition Man.

53:54.260 --> 53:56.004
That's quite all right.

53:56.096 --> 53:57.839
Unexpected. Creative.

53:59.099 --> 54:00.557
But quite all right.

54:00.642 --> 54:02.551
John Spartan, welcome.

54:03.603 --> 54:05.761
In honor of your arrival and your...

54:05.855 --> 54:08.263
...protection of the sanctity of human life...

54:08.358 --> 54:10.066
...namely my own...

54:10.193 --> 54:12.898
...I'd like to invite you to join me
for dinner tonight.

54:12.987 --> 54:14.150
Both of you.

54:14.239 --> 54:15.697
Please, I insist.

54:15.949 --> 54:18.107
I would like you to accompany me...

54:18.243 --> 54:19.902
...to Pizza Hut.

54:23.247 --> 54:25.323
Look forward to it. Thanks.

54:31.547 --> 54:32.923
"Pizza Hut?"

54:36.385 --> 54:38.259
So let me get this right:

54:38.387 --> 54:42.302
Spacely Sprockets here, who's now
the man in charge, the Mayor-Gov...

54:42.391 --> 54:44.799
...who wants to take me to Pizza Hut...

54:44.894 --> 54:46.602
...and I wouldn't mind a pizza...

54:46.687 --> 54:48.561
...has also built the damn cryo-prison?

54:48.648 --> 54:51.020
John Spartan, you are fined...

54:51.317 --> 54:54.234
Dr. Cocteau is the most important man
in town.

54:54.403 --> 54:57.108
He practically created our whole way
of life...

54:57.198 --> 54:58.573
...savage.

54:59.200 --> 55:00.480
He can have it.

55:01.577 --> 55:03.036
Phoenix could be anywhere...

55:03.120 --> 55:04.828
...but not being coded can limit him.

55:04.914 --> 55:06.990
Correct. Money is outmoded.

55:07.082 --> 55:09.122
All transactions are through codes.

55:09.210 --> 55:11.961
So he can't buy food
or a place to stay for the night.

55:12.046 --> 55:14.715
It'd be a waste of time to mug someone.

55:15.466 --> 55:17.838
Unless he rips off someone's hand.

55:17.927 --> 55:19.966
But with officers patrolling...

55:20.054 --> 55:23.387
...it should be just a matter
of tick-tocks before...

55:24.516 --> 55:26.474
We already have a backup plan.

55:27.644 --> 55:30.052
We can wait for another code to go red.

55:30.522 --> 55:33.393
When Phoenix performs
another MurderDeathKill...

55:33.567 --> 55:36.319
...we'll know exactly where to pounce.

55:36.820 --> 55:37.686
Great plan.

55:37.780 --> 55:39.155
Thank you.

55:45.078 --> 55:48.364
I've been an enthusiast of your escapades
for quite some time.

55:48.457 --> 55:52.585
In fact, I perused some visuals
from the Schwarzenegger Library.

55:53.086 --> 55:54.166
Hold it.

55:55.088 --> 55:56.796
"The Schwarzenegger Library?"

55:56.882 --> 55:59.669
Yes, the Schwarzenegger
Presidential Library.

55:59.926 --> 56:01.421
Wasn't he an actor?

56:01.595 --> 56:03.303
He was President?

56:03.847 --> 56:08.176
Even though he wasn't a native,
his popularity caused the 61st Amendment.

56:08.477 --> 56:10.350
I don't want to know.

56:12.439 --> 56:13.814
President?

56:23.325 --> 56:25.613
What's this? No welcome mat?

56:27.954 --> 56:29.448
What is this?

56:32.625 --> 56:35.199
How do they expect you to kill somebody?

56:37.464 --> 56:40.963
Shit, I love that smell.
Reminds me of biscuits and gravy.

56:41.301 --> 56:43.459
All right. A job is a job.

56:45.180 --> 56:49.473
Edgar Friendly, whoever the fuck you are,
prepare for Simon Phoenix.

56:52.687 --> 56:54.311
What's with Cocteau?

56:54.981 --> 56:57.768
He says I saved his life,
though I'm not sure of it.

56:57.859 --> 57:00.813
My reward is dinner and dancing
at Pizza Hut?

57:01.070 --> 57:03.941
I like a big, fat piece of pizza, but...

57:04.157 --> 57:06.233
Your tone is quasi-facetious.

57:06.743 --> 57:10.277
Pizza Hut is the only restaurant
to survive the Franchise Wars.

57:10.413 --> 57:11.492
So?

57:12.456 --> 57:14.615
Now all restaurants are Pizza Hut.

57:16.168 --> 57:17.413
No way.

57:27.054 --> 57:28.928
Welcome to Pizza Hut.

57:29.557 --> 57:31.181
Enjoy your meal.

57:32.893 --> 57:35.301
"Valley of the Jolly Green Giant

57:37.982 --> 57:40.224
"Good things from the garden

57:40.484 --> 57:42.358
"Garden in the valley

57:42.987 --> 57:45.478
"Valley of the Jolly Green Giant"

57:48.701 --> 57:50.859
Here comes the Neanderthal.

57:51.453 --> 57:54.324
Mr. Spartan over there please,
and Lieutenant...

57:54.456 --> 57:55.571
Thank you.

57:58.711 --> 58:00.371
How are you doing?

58:02.840 --> 58:04.916
Enjoy-joy your meal, sir.

58:05.759 --> 58:06.922
Good thing I'm hungry.

58:07.010 --> 58:11.471
Ladies and gentlemen, please raise
your glasses to the hero of the hour...

58:12.057 --> 58:13.635
...my savior...

58:13.767 --> 58:15.890
...Detective John Spartan.

58:18.188 --> 58:19.563
Appreciate it.

58:22.734 --> 58:24.478
Greetings and salutations.

58:24.736 --> 58:26.314
I'm Associate Bob.

58:26.405 --> 58:30.070
We met before, ever so briefly.
I was in fear at the time.

58:31.243 --> 58:33.116
Do you have the salt?

58:34.162 --> 58:37.163
Salt is not good for you, hence, it is illegal.

58:37.416 --> 58:39.325
So, John Spartan, tell me...

58:40.168 --> 58:43.086
...what do you think of San Angeles, 2032?

58:44.840 --> 58:48.090
I thought the future would be
a rotting cesspool.

58:49.094 --> 58:52.260
You weren't here
when the real disturbances began.

58:52.347 --> 58:55.016
Civilization tried to destroy itself.

58:55.433 --> 58:58.434
The city degenerated into a total fear zone.

58:58.937 --> 59:03.350
People stayed home, afraid to go out.
People wanted the madness over.

59:04.567 --> 59:07.402
When I saw the chance
to make things right...

59:07.570 --> 59:09.029
...I seized it.

59:10.615 --> 59:14.529
If I had not, the radiance
of San Angeles would not be here.

59:14.953 --> 59:19.661
Just your rotting cesspool of hate
and suffering. Which would you prefer?

59:19.958 --> 59:23.623
Can you book me a flight out of here
when the sermon's over?

59:23.795 --> 59:25.123
John Spartan...

59:25.296 --> 59:28.546
...for your crimes you would
surely have died...

59:28.633 --> 59:30.044
...in jail before now.

59:30.134 --> 59:34.132
Even you must appreciate
the persuasively tranquil humanity...

59:34.639 --> 59:36.928
...of the cryo-prison system?

59:37.809 --> 59:42.601
I don't want to spoil your dinner, but
my cryo-sentence was no sweet lullaby.

59:42.772 --> 59:44.811
I had feelings and thoughts.

59:45.024 --> 59:48.773
How about a 36-year nightmare
about people caught in a burning building?

59:48.861 --> 59:50.901
You were awake? I don't think so.

59:50.988 --> 59:52.399
I think so.

59:52.907 --> 59:56.821
My wife beating her fists against a block
of ice that was her husband.

59:56.911 --> 01:00:01.489
Then you woke me up and told me
everything that meant something is gone.

01:00:01.999 --> 01:00:06.127
It would have been more humane
to leave me to the fucking crows.

01:00:07.296 --> 01:00:10.416
What would you say
if I called you a brutish fossil...

01:00:10.508 --> 01:00:13.959
...symbolic of the decayed era
gratefully forgotten?

01:00:15.471 --> 01:00:17.131
I don't know."Thanks?"

01:00:17.848 --> 01:00:20.007
I thought during rehabilitation...

01:00:20.184 --> 01:00:24.182
...the prisoners were not conscious.
A person would go insane.

01:00:24.313 --> 01:00:26.306
The side-effects of the cryo-process...

01:00:26.398 --> 01:00:27.774
...are unavoidable.

01:00:27.858 --> 01:00:29.851
You were found guilty of a crime.

01:00:29.943 --> 01:00:32.019
You owed and still owe a debt to society.

01:00:32.112 --> 01:00:33.357
There's nothing I can do.

01:00:33.447 --> 01:00:36.234
Yes, call for backup.
I'll be across the street.

01:00:36.325 --> 01:00:37.784
Where are you going?

01:00:37.868 --> 01:00:41.782
Bad guys about to do bad things.
It's just one of those hunches.

01:01:02.351 --> 01:01:03.513
Go for the truck!

01:01:03.602 --> 01:01:05.310
The food's in the truck!

01:01:08.106 --> 01:01:10.146
Grab the big box! Move!

01:01:21.995 --> 01:01:25.494
You'll regret this the rest of your life.
Both seconds of it.

01:01:30.754 --> 01:01:31.916
Good night!

01:01:41.723 --> 01:01:43.003
Get him!

01:02:00.783 --> 01:02:03.109
What a fucking hero. Come on.

01:02:12.670 --> 01:02:14.045
Please, don't.

01:02:20.011 --> 01:02:21.291
What the hell?

01:02:22.305 --> 01:02:23.965
Such reckless abandonment.

01:02:24.056 --> 01:02:26.464
Looks like there is a new shepherd in town.

01:02:26.559 --> 01:02:28.848
That's "sheriff." Who are those guys?

01:02:28.936 --> 01:02:30.976
They're known as "scraps."

01:02:31.314 --> 01:02:33.983
Outcasts and deserters who choose
to live beneath us...

01:02:34.066 --> 01:02:36.640
...in sewers and abandoned tunnels.

01:02:37.653 --> 01:02:40.737
They're a constant irritation
to our harmony.

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:42.948
They're nothing but thugs.

01:02:43.325 --> 01:02:47.489
A society of thieves. The last remaining
criminal element in the city.

01:02:47.746 --> 01:02:51.115
But plans are in progress
to purge this peril from our day.

01:02:51.458 --> 01:02:53.914
You're better live than on laser disk.

01:02:54.003 --> 01:02:57.585
The way you paused to make a witticism
before doing battle...

01:02:57.756 --> 01:02:59.500
...with that Scrap...

01:02:59.675 --> 01:03:01.668
This isn't the Wild West, okay?

01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.216
The Wild West wasn't even the Wild West.

01:03:04.304 --> 01:03:06.131
Hurting people isn't good.

01:03:06.432 --> 01:03:08.092
Sometimes it is, but not...

01:03:08.183 --> 01:03:10.509
...when it's people looking for food.

01:03:18.986 --> 01:03:21.311
San Angeles time is now 22:15.

01:03:22.614 --> 01:03:23.859
Coding off.

01:03:24.032 --> 01:03:25.147
Auto-drive.

01:03:25.242 --> 01:03:27.033
Auto-drive engaged.

01:03:32.541 --> 01:03:34.664
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

01:03:36.461 --> 01:03:38.787
No need for a de-hurtful retraction.

01:03:39.089 --> 01:03:41.627
I assimilated too much contraband.

01:03:41.925 --> 01:03:46.053
I fleshed you out as
a blow-up-the-bad- guy-while-grinning type.

01:03:46.304 --> 01:03:50.765
But you're the moody-gunslinger-who-
will-only-draw-when-he-must type.

01:03:51.893 --> 01:03:52.723
Stop.

01:03:52.811 --> 01:03:53.641
What?

01:03:53.728 --> 01:03:55.970
I just do my job and things get...

01:03:56.064 --> 01:03:57.227
Demolished.

01:04:04.823 --> 01:04:08.441
I think of my daughter growing up
in a place like this.

01:04:08.702 --> 01:04:11.489
I'm afraid she'll think I'm a primitive.

01:04:11.663 --> 01:04:14.699
As much as I want to see her,
I almost don't want to.

01:04:14.791 --> 01:04:17.412
Because I don't think I'll fit in well.

01:04:17.585 --> 01:04:18.996
Not at all.

01:04:21.381 --> 01:04:25.461
It'd be a minor misuse of police powers,
but I could do a search for you.

01:04:31.266 --> 01:04:32.464
Sorry.

01:04:36.562 --> 01:04:38.970
Subject change. I got what you wanted.

01:04:39.107 --> 01:04:40.269
Great.

01:04:44.529 --> 01:04:45.904
What's that for?

01:04:46.989 --> 01:04:49.196
It's just one of those cop hunches.

01:04:58.668 --> 01:04:59.913
Lights.

01:05:01.462 --> 01:05:03.205
I've changed that.

01:05:04.048 --> 01:05:05.459
Illuminate.

01:05:06.967 --> 01:05:08.378
Deluminate.

01:05:11.680 --> 01:05:13.175
Isn't that nicer?

01:05:13.307 --> 01:05:14.967
Go ahead, you try.

01:05:16.393 --> 01:05:17.804
Illuminate.

01:05:20.397 --> 01:05:23.019
Raymond, Raymond, we've got to talk.

01:05:23.817 --> 01:05:25.442
How did you get in?

01:05:25.569 --> 01:05:27.941
Wish I knew. I got pass codes.

01:05:28.822 --> 01:05:30.400
Routes to underground kingdoms.

01:05:30.491 --> 01:05:34.073
Complete access
to the industrial data-grid interface.

01:05:34.495 --> 01:05:36.653
I don't even know what that means.

01:05:36.830 --> 01:05:39.831
But I've been meaning to ask you,
because I like it!

01:05:39.917 --> 01:05:41.411
I like it a lot!

01:05:43.337 --> 01:05:45.744
You have been given these skills
for a reason.

01:05:45.839 --> 01:05:48.247
Not for your personal amusement.

01:05:48.550 --> 01:05:52.500
Your job is to kill Mr. Edgar Friendly
and stop a revolution.

01:05:53.472 --> 01:05:56.045
That is why you were rehabilitated.

01:05:59.102 --> 01:06:02.685
All right. I'm going to do
your dastardly deed for you.

01:06:03.607 --> 01:06:06.561
But it'll be more difficult than you thought.

01:06:06.693 --> 01:06:08.935
I'm going to need some help.

01:06:09.363 --> 01:06:12.529
I'll need about five
or six more "special" men.

01:06:13.867 --> 01:06:15.527
I happen to have a list.

01:06:15.702 --> 01:06:20.447
I wouldn't want you to defrost any
of those killer types, know what I mean?

01:06:20.707 --> 01:06:24.372
And none of those motherfuckers
from New York. They're too uptight.

01:06:24.461 --> 01:06:27.415
So you're going to be the only killer type?

01:06:31.885 --> 01:06:32.964
Fine.

01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:35.346
Take care of it.

01:06:36.723 --> 01:06:38.301
Just get it over with.

01:06:38.641 --> 01:06:41.014
You're more trouble than you're worth.

01:06:41.227 --> 01:06:43.469
Oh, Raymond, don't say that.

01:06:45.315 --> 01:06:47.853
And what do I get out of all this?

01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:51.897
What do you want?

01:06:52.489 --> 01:06:53.484
Malibu.

01:06:54.407 --> 01:06:57.906
Santa Monica.
Hell, how about all the coastal cities?

01:06:59.495 --> 01:07:01.322
I'll bear it in mind.

01:07:01.497 --> 01:07:04.498
- Good, I'll send you a memo.
- Just do your job!

01:07:09.172 --> 01:07:11.579
What is John Spartan doing here?

01:07:13.342 --> 01:07:15.501
Did you invite him to this party?

01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:19.506
Look, you finish your business...

01:07:19.599 --> 01:07:21.757
...and I'll stuff him back in the freezer.

01:07:21.851 --> 01:07:24.093
Think of him as a guarantee.

01:07:24.353 --> 01:07:25.812
"A guarantee?"

01:07:26.606 --> 01:07:28.931
You don't have much of a guarantee.

01:07:29.525 --> 01:07:32.811
I took care of Spartan once,
I'll take care of him again.

01:07:36.115 --> 01:07:38.523
Now we need those men defrosted.

01:07:43.205 --> 01:07:44.865
Is this where you live?

01:07:45.041 --> 01:07:46.451
Very not bad.

01:07:46.625 --> 01:07:47.740
Thank you.

01:07:48.377 --> 01:07:50.370
Where will I be staying?

01:07:50.546 --> 01:07:53.915
I've procured you a domicile
down the corridor from my own.

01:07:57.344 --> 01:08:00.298
Everything is voice coded,
so if you need something, just ask.

01:08:00.389 --> 01:08:01.552
Lights.

01:08:03.142 --> 01:08:04.600
What do you think?

01:08:05.603 --> 01:08:09.303
Clicked off a lot of credits to create
the perfect 20th-century apartment.

01:08:09.398 --> 01:08:10.726
It's very...

01:08:10.899 --> 01:08:11.979
Isn't it?

01:08:14.820 --> 01:08:16.231
John Spartan...

01:08:18.657 --> 01:08:21.148
There's a well-known, documented...

01:08:21.326 --> 01:08:23.899
...connection between sex and violence.

01:08:24.662 --> 01:08:26.738
Not so much a causal effect...

01:08:26.915 --> 01:08:30.000
...but a general state
of neurological arousal.

01:08:30.502 --> 01:08:31.700
And...

01:08:32.004 --> 01:08:35.787
...after having observed
your behavior this evening and...

01:08:36.675 --> 01:08:38.917
...my resultant condition...

01:08:42.014 --> 01:08:45.014
...I was wondering
if you'd like to have sex?

01:08:50.354 --> 01:08:51.434
With you?

01:08:54.109 --> 01:08:55.022
Here?

01:08:56.111 --> 01:08:57.189
Now?

01:08:59.948 --> 01:09:00.861
Yeah.

01:09:01.700 --> 01:09:02.649
Great!

01:09:05.370 --> 01:09:06.863
I'll be right back.

01:09:24.389 --> 01:09:25.764
Love Boat?

01:09:45.368 --> 01:09:46.613
There you go.

01:09:52.207 --> 01:09:55.328
Now, just relax.
We'll begin in a few seconds.

01:09:56.546 --> 01:09:57.874
Begin what?

01:09:58.548 --> 01:10:00.457
Having sex, of course.

01:10:59.274 --> 01:11:00.733
You broke contact.

01:11:00.901 --> 01:11:03.356
"Contact?" I didn't even touch you yet.

01:11:03.445 --> 01:11:05.603
You said you wanted to make love.

01:11:05.948 --> 01:11:07.525
Is that what this is?

01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:14.536
Vir-sex produces high alpha waves
during transference of sexual energies.

01:11:14.748 --> 01:11:17.286
Let's do it the old-fashioned way.

01:11:18.293 --> 01:11:19.621
Disgusting!

01:11:19.795 --> 01:11:20.957
You mean...

01:11:22.422 --> 01:11:26.040
- ... fluid transfer?
- No, I mean boning, the wild mambo.

01:11:27.427 --> 01:11:29.135
That is no longer done.

01:11:29.471 --> 01:11:32.674
Do you know what the exchange
of bodily fluids leads to?

01:11:32.807 --> 01:11:35.180
Kids, smoking, desire to raid the fridge.

01:11:35.268 --> 01:11:39.977
Rampant exchange of bodily fluids
was a major cause of society's downfall.

01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:43.560
After AIDS, there was NRS,
then there was UBT.

01:11:44.152 --> 01:11:47.272
One of the first things Cocteau did
was to outlaw...

01:11:47.447 --> 01:11:51.445
...and engineer all fluid transfer
out of socially acceptable behavior.

01:11:51.659 --> 01:11:54.329
Not even a mouth transfer's condoned.

01:11:54.496 --> 01:11:55.906
Kissing's not allowed?

01:11:55.997 --> 01:11:57.491
I was a good kisser.

01:11:59.292 --> 01:12:00.620
What about kids?

01:12:01.169 --> 01:12:02.628
Procreation?

01:12:02.962 --> 01:12:04.456
We go to a lab.

01:12:04.672 --> 01:12:06.748
Fluids are purified, screened...

01:12:06.841 --> 01:12:10.127
...and transferred by authorized
medical personnel only.

01:12:10.303 --> 01:12:12.177
It is the only legal way.

01:12:15.641 --> 01:12:17.100
What're you doing?

01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:19.221
Breaking the law.

01:12:21.022 --> 01:12:23.145
You are a savage creature.

01:12:23.649 --> 01:12:26.187
I wish you to leave my domicile. Now!

01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:34.028
You know...

01:12:54.513 --> 01:12:57.135
Code accepted. Be well, John Spartan.

01:13:07.359 --> 01:13:08.604
Lights.

01:13:26.378 --> 01:13:29.249
"He doesn't know how
to use the three seashells."

01:13:36.096 --> 01:13:37.756
Happy Halloween.

01:14:09.254 --> 01:14:11.330
"Behavioral engineering?"

01:14:12.465 --> 01:14:16.249
Hi, Martin, I was thinking...
Oh, my God, I'm sorry, wrong number.

01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:32.185
Our noble facility has been desecrated
by hooligans.

01:14:33.111 --> 01:14:35.483
Someone will pay dearly for this.

01:14:39.158 --> 01:14:42.610
Sir, the stress breeder
is inside being demobilized.

01:14:44.122 --> 01:14:47.241
Shit! Being frozen must've thrown
my aim off. Don't worry.

01:14:47.333 --> 01:14:48.827
The next shot.

01:14:49.002 --> 01:14:50.626
I don't think so.

01:14:51.295 --> 01:14:53.454
No kiss-kiss, no bang-bang.

01:15:06.519 --> 01:15:08.677
I'm sorry about last night.

01:15:10.648 --> 01:15:12.142
I made this for you.

01:15:16.028 --> 01:15:16.977
For me?

01:15:19.699 --> 01:15:21.027
Thank you.

01:15:24.370 --> 01:15:25.532
I'll drive.

01:15:25.996 --> 01:15:28.369
I must learn to do this sometime.

01:15:42.221 --> 01:15:44.048
Thanks for the lovely gift.

01:15:45.015 --> 01:15:49.724
I don't know what was in my cryo-sludge
but when I thawed, I wanted to knit.

01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:54.178
How come I know what a zipperfoot,
a shuttle and a bobbin is?

01:15:55.234 --> 01:15:58.151
I could weave a throw rug now
with my eyes closed.

01:15:58.529 --> 01:16:00.605
It's part of your rehab program.

01:16:00.697 --> 01:16:03.485
For each inmate the computer
draws up a skill or trade...

01:16:03.575 --> 01:16:05.484
...suited to their genetic disposition.

01:16:05.577 --> 01:16:07.285
It implants the knowledge...

01:16:07.371 --> 01:16:10.455
...and the desire to carry out
the training assigned.

01:16:12.084 --> 01:16:13.578
I'm a seamstress?

01:16:14.044 --> 01:16:15.372
That's great.

01:16:15.545 --> 01:16:18.167
I come out of cryo-prison
and I'm Betsy-fucking-Ross.

01:16:18.256 --> 01:16:20.712
Phoenix can access computers,
operate all vehicles...

01:16:20.801 --> 01:16:23.173
...knows the location
of everything in town...

01:16:23.261 --> 01:16:25.883
...and is three times stronger than before?

01:16:28.433 --> 01:16:30.924
Can you get me his rehab program?

01:16:33.563 --> 01:16:36.481
- I'm a seamstress.
- Access code for Simon Phoenix.

01:16:36.900 --> 01:16:38.560
Access Simon Phoenix.

01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:40.391
Accessing.

01:16:41.738 --> 01:16:42.983
Access denied.

01:16:43.907 --> 01:16:45.484
- What?
- Security override.

01:16:45.575 --> 01:16:47.117
That can't be right.

01:16:50.955 --> 01:16:53.328
Access granted, Officer Huxley.

01:16:54.376 --> 01:16:57.460
Accessing Simon Phoenix,
Deepfile rehab 65-R.

01:16:58.296 --> 01:16:59.494
Urban Combatkill.

01:16:59.589 --> 01:17:01.961
Torture Methodology.
Computer Override Authority.

01:17:02.050 --> 01:17:04.007
- There must be a mistake.
- Survival Tactics.

01:17:04.093 --> 01:17:07.462
Terrorism Tactics. Weapons Training.
Martial Arts. MurderDeathKill.

01:17:07.555 --> 01:17:09.714
Explosives Technician. Violent Behavior.

01:17:09.807 --> 01:17:12.678
- This isn't a rehab program.
- No kidding.

01:17:12.977 --> 01:17:14.851
This would create a monster.

01:17:14.938 --> 01:17:16.562
Who develops these programs?

01:17:16.648 --> 01:17:18.308
Cocteau Industries.

01:17:19.108 --> 01:17:20.852
But why would the benevolent...

01:17:20.943 --> 01:17:24.028
...Dr. Cocteau send such
a brute savage into our midst?

01:17:24.113 --> 01:17:26.022
Good question. Let's go ask him.

01:17:26.115 --> 01:17:29.816
You do not accuse our savior
of being connected with a...

01:17:29.994 --> 01:17:32.663
...multi-murderer like Phoenix. It's...

01:17:33.498 --> 01:17:34.778
...rude.

01:17:35.124 --> 01:17:36.499
I'll be subtle.

01:17:37.835 --> 01:17:39.329
I'm good at subtle.

01:17:41.505 --> 01:17:43.000
Mellow greetings.

01:17:43.174 --> 01:17:44.668
We welcome you...

01:17:44.800 --> 01:17:47.754
...to the Cocteau Behavioral
Engineering Complex.

01:17:47.845 --> 01:17:48.960
Be well.

01:17:49.138 --> 01:17:51.178
Enhance your calm, John Spartan.

01:17:56.479 --> 01:18:00.097
Mellow apologies for my lack
of physical disposition...

01:18:00.483 --> 01:18:02.392
...but I have a city-gov to run.

01:18:02.485 --> 01:18:04.062
Well, run this.

01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:07.736
You programmed Phoenix's rehab
to turn him into a terrorist.

01:18:07.823 --> 01:18:10.397
And I don't think his escape
was an accident.

01:18:10.492 --> 01:18:11.691
Very subtle.

01:18:12.286 --> 01:18:14.492
Outside the museum,
why didn't he kill you?

01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:15.955
What did you say?

01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:18.365
I don't remember. Does it matter?

01:18:18.542 --> 01:18:20.784
It matters. I saw the security disk.

01:18:20.878 --> 01:18:24.662
He had 10 seconds to figure out
where to put the hole in your head.

01:18:24.882 --> 01:18:29.294
This display of barbaric behavior
was unacceptable even in your time.

01:18:31.722 --> 01:18:33.264
But it worked.

01:18:38.395 --> 01:18:42.974
When Phoenix has a gun, 10 seconds
is 91/2 seconds longer than you get.

01:18:43.901 --> 01:18:45.443
Not everyone is as eager as you...

01:18:45.527 --> 01:18:49.026
...to resort to violence
to solve life's difficulties.

01:18:50.574 --> 01:18:55.449
I wonder if the chaos in the museum
was the result of Mr. Phoenix's presence.

01:18:56.371 --> 01:18:57.830
Wonder about this...

01:18:57.914 --> 01:18:59.112
...shithead.

01:18:59.207 --> 01:19:02.742
If you think you got this maniac
under control, trust me...

01:19:02.919 --> 01:19:04.248
...you don't.

01:19:04.546 --> 01:19:08.544
Is there something specific you plan
to do with that archaic device?

01:19:12.053 --> 01:19:13.713
No, I didn't think so.

01:19:15.765 --> 01:19:18.885
The only thing I haven't got
under control is you.

01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:21.053
But that can be solved.

01:19:21.229 --> 01:19:24.764
You, my Cro-Magnon friend, are dead.
Your family's dead...

01:19:24.941 --> 01:19:26.519
...your past is dead.

01:19:26.943 --> 01:19:29.730
Dead things cannot affect the living. So...

01:19:30.071 --> 01:19:31.696
...enjoy your moment...

01:19:31.781 --> 01:19:35.731
...of prehistoric bravado because
after you leave here it will be over.

01:19:35.827 --> 01:19:38.234
Like everything else in your life.

01:19:38.454 --> 01:19:41.906
Officer, return this man
to cryo-stasis immediately.

01:19:42.458 --> 01:19:43.739
Be well.

01:19:45.128 --> 01:19:46.503
Be fucked.

01:19:47.297 --> 01:19:49.254
You are fined one credit...

01:19:54.429 --> 01:19:57.595
Greetings, Citizen.
How are you on this glorious day?

01:19:58.558 --> 01:19:59.886
I'll wait here.

01:20:00.017 --> 01:20:00.966
Let's go.

01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:03.682
- I don't know.
- I do know. Turn that thing on.

01:20:03.771 --> 01:20:05.930
I hope you know what you're doing.

01:20:06.941 --> 01:20:09.432
You're asking me to disobey a direct order.

01:20:09.527 --> 01:20:11.519
I'm to escort you to the cryo-prison.

01:20:11.612 --> 01:20:15.610
I must get that maniac and put him
on ice or that's where I'll be.

01:20:15.825 --> 01:20:18.612
- Enhance your calm.
- I've had it with enhancing my calm.

01:20:18.703 --> 01:20:23.281
I'll enhance that psycho's calm.
Then I'll turn my attention to Cocteau.

01:20:24.834 --> 01:20:27.621
You don't have to come with me.
I can do it alone.

01:20:27.712 --> 01:20:31.543
Even if Phoenix was programmed
to escape, kill and steal...

01:20:32.174 --> 01:20:34.083
...why are you going to the wasteland?

01:20:34.176 --> 01:20:38.340
Your city-wide manhunt didn't work
because Phoenix was in a place...

01:20:38.514 --> 01:20:40.091
...you can't monitor...

01:20:40.182 --> 01:20:43.183
...afraid to go and don't give a shit about.

01:20:43.852 --> 01:20:47.981
I want to go down there, find Phoenix
and put him in a hurt locker.

01:20:49.358 --> 01:20:51.849
Do you want to come? Or arrest me?

01:20:54.530 --> 01:20:55.858
I'm with you.

01:20:56.490 --> 01:20:58.198
Let's go blow this guy.

01:21:00.661 --> 01:21:01.657
Away.

01:21:01.829 --> 01:21:03.620
Blow this guy away.

01:21:04.706 --> 01:21:05.821
Whatever.

01:21:12.339 --> 01:21:14.082
She has a way with words.

01:21:20.555 --> 01:21:21.635
What's wrong?

01:21:21.723 --> 01:21:23.515
It's not very clean.

01:21:28.188 --> 01:21:29.896
A real garden spot.

01:21:30.524 --> 01:21:32.066
Okay, which way?

01:21:32.359 --> 01:21:33.521
Over there.

01:21:33.735 --> 01:21:35.858
Okay, be ready for anything.

01:21:44.037 --> 01:21:46.362
"My dog's better than your dog

01:21:46.539 --> 01:21:48.698
"My dog's better than yours

01:21:48.917 --> 01:21:52.037
"My dog's better 'cause
he gets Kennel-Ration"

01:21:52.754 --> 01:21:55.210
I'm sorry, when I'm nervous, I...

01:21:55.715 --> 01:21:56.711
Sorry.

01:21:57.425 --> 01:21:58.801
Over here.

01:22:19.739 --> 01:22:21.648
What's that emanation?

01:22:26.454 --> 01:22:27.734
Come on.

01:22:36.589 --> 01:22:39.080
Relax. I just want a burger and a beer.

01:22:41.302 --> 01:22:42.630
How will I pay?

01:22:44.430 --> 01:22:46.090
It's better to give.

01:22:54.148 --> 01:22:55.311
Want a slug?

01:22:58.444 --> 01:22:59.772
No, thank you.

01:22:59.987 --> 01:23:01.814
I think I'll be sick.

01:23:02.114 --> 01:23:03.395
Oh, God.

01:23:03.824 --> 01:23:06.362
This is fantastic. You must try one.

01:23:06.660 --> 01:23:09.151
Don't ask where the meat comes from.

01:23:09.330 --> 01:23:10.740
What do you mean?

01:23:10.831 --> 01:23:12.907
See any cows around here?

01:23:21.634 --> 01:23:22.629
Rat?

01:23:24.345 --> 01:23:25.922
This is a rat burger?

01:23:30.976 --> 01:23:32.174
Not bad.

01:23:33.645 --> 01:23:36.053
It's the best burger I've had in years.

01:23:38.817 --> 01:23:40.146
See you later.

01:24:03.341 --> 01:24:06.177
They don't seem very hostile,
John Spartan.

01:24:07.345 --> 01:24:08.674
No, they don't.

01:24:18.064 --> 01:24:20.353
Now that's a thing of beauty.

01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.985
Do you know what this is?

01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:25.979
A 1970 Oldsmobile 442.

01:24:29.034 --> 01:24:31.322
With a 455-cubic-inch engine.

01:24:32.704 --> 01:24:35.029
Radial tires and bucket seats.

01:24:36.416 --> 01:24:37.744
I'm impressed.

01:24:38.001 --> 01:24:39.115
I studied.

01:24:39.210 --> 01:24:41.701
So did I. Hand over the glow-rod.

01:24:41.880 --> 01:24:44.038
Your friends too. Come on.

01:24:52.265 --> 01:24:54.672
You got balls, coming down here.

01:24:55.393 --> 01:24:57.516
We're looking for a MurderDeathKiller.

01:24:57.603 --> 01:25:01.103
Can you help us or just bully us
with your primitive weapons?

01:25:05.945 --> 01:25:07.985
Maybe they're not so primitive.

01:25:10.741 --> 01:25:12.366
You think you're taking me in?

01:25:12.451 --> 01:25:13.531
Guess what?

01:25:13.619 --> 01:25:14.864
Not happening.

01:25:15.079 --> 01:25:18.115
Tell Cocteau he can kiss my ass.
That's right.

01:25:18.457 --> 01:25:20.830
It'll take an army to get rid of me.

01:25:20.918 --> 01:25:23.207
I don't give a shit. I got nothing to lose.

01:25:23.296 --> 01:25:27.792
I don't know who the hell you are,
let alone want to take you anywhere.

01:25:28.301 --> 01:25:31.467
So stay here, be well
and Cocteau's an asshole!

01:25:32.596 --> 01:25:35.930
Let's dump them up top.
They're only here to spy on us.

01:25:37.101 --> 01:25:38.346
Wait a minute.

01:25:40.104 --> 01:25:42.310
You're the guy outside Pizza Hut.

01:25:44.066 --> 01:25:45.477
What do you want?

01:25:45.985 --> 01:25:48.440
You weren't part of the Cocteau plan.

01:25:48.612 --> 01:25:51.898
Greed, deception, abuse of power.
That's no plan.

01:25:54.451 --> 01:25:56.824
- That's why you're here?
- That's right.

01:25:56.996 --> 01:25:57.991
See...

01:25:58.455 --> 01:26:00.448
According to Cocteau's plan...

01:26:00.624 --> 01:26:03.115
...I'm an enemy because I like to think.

01:26:03.460 --> 01:26:04.575
I like to read.

01:26:04.670 --> 01:26:06.544
I'm into freedom of speech and choice.

01:26:06.630 --> 01:26:08.255
I like to sit in a greasy spoon...

01:26:08.340 --> 01:26:12.634
...and think, "Should I have steak
or barbecued ribs with gravy fries?"

01:26:12.845 --> 01:26:14.220
I want high cholesterol.

01:26:14.304 --> 01:26:16.795
I want to eat bacon, butter and cheese.

01:26:16.974 --> 01:26:19.725
I want to smoke a Cuban cigar
the size of Cincinnati.

01:26:19.810 --> 01:26:22.727
I want to run through the streets naked...

01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:26.183
...reading Playboy magazine
because I might need to.

01:26:26.358 --> 01:26:27.900
I've seen the future.

01:26:27.985 --> 01:26:29.811
It's a 47-year-old virgin...

01:26:29.903 --> 01:26:32.939
...drinking a banana-broccoli shake
and singing "I'm a wiener."

01:26:33.031 --> 01:26:34.573
Up top, you live Cocteau's way.

01:26:34.658 --> 01:26:36.816
What he wants, when he wants,
how he wants.

01:26:36.910 --> 01:26:39.152
Your other choice: come here.

01:26:40.455 --> 01:26:42.033
Maybe starve to death.

01:26:42.833 --> 01:26:46.118
Why don't you take charge
and lead these people out of here?

01:26:46.211 --> 01:26:47.409
I'm no leader.

01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:49.456
I do what I have to do.

01:26:49.589 --> 01:26:51.167
Sometimes people join me.

01:26:51.258 --> 01:26:55.884
I just want to bury Cocteau up to his neck
in shit and let him think happy thoughts.

01:26:56.263 --> 01:26:58.089
Then I got bad news.

01:26:58.848 --> 01:27:01.055
I think he wants to kill you.

01:27:03.853 --> 01:27:06.309
All right gentlemen, let's review.

01:27:07.107 --> 01:27:08.482
The year is 2032.

01:27:09.317 --> 01:27:12.069
That's 2-0-3-2. As in the 21st century.

01:27:13.404 --> 01:27:17.568
And I'm sorry to say that
the world has become a pussy-whipped...

01:27:18.493 --> 01:27:22.656
...Brady Bunch version of itself
run by a bunch of robed sissies.

01:27:23.706 --> 01:27:26.493
All we have to do to run the whole thing...

01:27:26.626 --> 01:27:30.540
...is to kill a man named Friendly,
who put it all together.

01:27:31.798 --> 01:27:34.289
But there's an extra added bonus.

01:27:36.052 --> 01:27:37.546
We get to kill...

01:27:37.720 --> 01:27:40.045
...the man who put us in the freezer.

01:27:40.223 --> 01:27:41.385
You mean...

01:27:41.557 --> 01:27:43.301
...we get to kill John Spartan?

01:27:43.392 --> 01:27:44.555
Exactly.

01:27:44.894 --> 01:27:48.144
I want you to loot, pillage,
plunder, and steal.

01:27:48.481 --> 01:27:52.941
Do all the wonderful things we used to do
before any of this happened.

01:27:53.694 --> 01:27:55.734
This world will be ours!

01:27:55.947 --> 01:27:57.773
Let's bring back the good old days!

01:27:57.865 --> 01:27:59.240
Are you with me?

01:27:59.951 --> 01:28:02.073
Are you with me? Let's do it!

01:28:04.914 --> 01:28:09.042
It is a curious conclusion
which you have deduced, John Spartan.

01:28:09.919 --> 01:28:12.670
But I can find no fault in your logic.

01:28:12.797 --> 01:28:16.925
Phoenix is the perfect weapon to send
into these savage regions.

01:28:17.635 --> 01:28:19.592
I'm impressed, John Spartan.

01:28:19.803 --> 01:28:22.425
They thawed him out just to kill me?

01:28:23.515 --> 01:28:26.635
- I'm flattered.
- Don't be flattered. Be frightened.

01:28:26.894 --> 01:28:29.100
This guy's a certifiable nightmare.

01:28:29.271 --> 01:28:31.264
That's why you're here?

01:28:33.651 --> 01:28:37.233
I must have done something right
in the previous life.

01:28:37.738 --> 01:28:40.229
Can't imagine what that could have been.

01:28:42.201 --> 01:28:43.909
Two for the price of one.

01:28:44.161 --> 01:28:45.821
Let's take them.

01:28:50.792 --> 01:28:52.121
Stay down!

01:29:25.243 --> 01:29:28.161
I'll be damned.
Like a New York cockroach.

01:29:57.900 --> 01:29:59.608
Everything's gone wrong.

01:30:16.127 --> 01:30:18.582
There's an elevator shaft at the top.

01:30:20.882 --> 01:30:22.424
So we're going up?

01:30:22.592 --> 01:30:25.165
Momentito, Senorita Huxley. Come on.

01:30:43.821 --> 01:30:46.526
How nice! Must've been expecting me.

01:31:03.465 --> 01:31:04.710
Now what?

01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:06.175
Buckle up.

01:31:29.616 --> 01:31:31.573
There he is! He's in my car!

01:31:37.624 --> 01:31:39.035
Goddamn it.

01:31:45.632 --> 01:31:47.790
What's happening to cops today?

01:31:47.884 --> 01:31:50.506
Don't you know
you are endangering civilians?

01:32:09.155 --> 01:32:10.021
Auto-inflate!

01:32:10.115 --> 01:32:11.443
Auto-inflate.

01:32:16.996 --> 01:32:18.111
That was lovely.

01:32:18.206 --> 01:32:19.700
Huxley, drive!

01:32:20.250 --> 01:32:22.622
Okay, I've read all about this.

01:32:25.213 --> 01:32:27.502
What do I do? Push this pedal?

01:32:29.926 --> 01:32:31.503
Okay, I got it.

01:32:41.062 --> 01:32:42.390
Punch it!

01:32:42.647 --> 01:32:43.726
Excuse me?

01:32:43.856 --> 01:32:46.347
Push the pedal as hard as you can!

01:32:57.954 --> 01:32:59.199
No free rides!

01:33:04.752 --> 01:33:06.330
Emergency, doors open.

01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:07.665
Doors opening.

01:33:08.964 --> 01:33:10.672
Say hello to my friend.

01:33:22.937 --> 01:33:24.016
Doors close!

01:33:24.104 --> 01:33:25.267
Malfunction.

01:33:30.903 --> 01:33:32.777
Computer, auto-drive.

01:33:33.030 --> 01:33:34.738
Auto-drive engaged.

01:33:34.907 --> 01:33:36.816
Going to give you a haircut!

01:33:38.327 --> 01:33:40.485
Remember the 40 bus passengers...

01:33:40.579 --> 01:33:42.987
...you blew up trying to get me?

01:33:44.375 --> 01:33:46.367
They were already dead.

01:33:46.835 --> 01:33:48.662
Cold as Haagen-Dazs!

01:33:56.762 --> 01:33:59.383
I went to jail with a 36-year smile.

01:34:00.599 --> 01:34:02.058
You're dead.

01:34:02.267 --> 01:34:04.059
Speak for yourself.

01:34:13.278 --> 01:34:14.227
Self-drive!

01:34:14.321 --> 01:34:16.064
Unable to execute.

01:34:16.364 --> 01:34:18.024
- Self-drive! Now!
- Malfunction.

01:34:18.116 --> 01:34:19.860
Unable to execute.

01:34:20.118 --> 01:34:21.281
Emergency!

01:34:23.330 --> 01:34:24.444
Brake!

01:34:25.790 --> 01:34:27.285
Self-drive engaged.

01:34:28.919 --> 01:34:30.461
Brake! Brake!

01:34:32.797 --> 01:34:35.751
Brake now, you,
Mickey Mouse piece of shit!

01:35:10.501 --> 01:35:12.209
Are you in there?

01:35:13.838 --> 01:35:15.996
Who do you think it is, Huxley?

01:35:24.223 --> 01:35:27.343
I thought your life force
had been prematurely terminated!

01:35:27.435 --> 01:35:29.677
I thought I was history too.

01:35:29.854 --> 01:35:33.602
What happened? All of a sudden,
this car turned into a cannoli.

01:35:33.858 --> 01:35:36.645
It's the curefoam. It saved your life.

01:35:36.861 --> 01:35:39.186
Look at you, you're in shambles.

01:35:39.488 --> 01:35:42.857
I can fix it later.
All I need is a needle and thread.

01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:45.110
Did I really say that?

01:35:55.045 --> 01:35:57.536
You caveman, you're under arrest!

01:35:58.132 --> 01:36:00.705
You're to be returned to the cryo-prison.
Immediately!

01:36:00.801 --> 01:36:03.506
I heard all that. We'll talk later, Chief.

01:36:04.763 --> 01:36:07.634
I need something. A shotgun, a flare gun.

01:36:11.228 --> 01:36:12.094
Shit!

01:36:12.271 --> 01:36:13.765
Defensive red alert!

01:36:15.482 --> 01:36:16.893
Stun batons on.

01:36:18.235 --> 01:36:19.433
Relax.

01:36:20.404 --> 01:36:22.231
Did you bump your noggin...

01:36:22.322 --> 01:36:24.481
...and think you're Pancho Villa?

01:36:24.992 --> 01:36:25.941
Who?

01:36:26.451 --> 01:36:27.317
Never mind.

01:36:27.411 --> 01:36:28.953
Time to take a stand.

01:36:29.037 --> 01:36:32.656
Good. While you're doing it,
loan me a gun. Two guns.

01:36:32.916 --> 01:36:36.830
You'd use these weapons against men
and women who uphold the law?

01:36:37.045 --> 01:36:39.916
We use these weapons
to shop for groceries, dick.

01:36:42.092 --> 01:36:43.467
You can't leave.

01:36:43.677 --> 01:36:48.386
You're under arrest. This very concept
negates the possibility of your leaving.

01:36:48.598 --> 01:36:50.176
Skip it, Chief.

01:36:50.642 --> 01:36:52.385
Lieutenant Huxley!

01:36:52.727 --> 01:36:53.759
Chief...

01:36:53.854 --> 01:36:57.020
...you can take this job
and you can shovel it.

01:36:59.568 --> 01:37:01.228
"Take this job...

01:37:01.444 --> 01:37:02.987
"... and shovel it."

01:37:04.614 --> 01:37:06.108
Close enough.

01:37:11.538 --> 01:37:15.867
I hadn't counted on this but I must say,
you worked out beautifully.

01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:18.869
People are terrified of you.

01:37:19.212 --> 01:37:22.047
What's new? People have always been
terrified of me.

01:37:22.132 --> 01:37:25.002
But this time they're really intimidated.

01:37:27.262 --> 01:37:28.460
Now...

01:37:28.763 --> 01:37:32.512
...I'll have carte blanche
to create the perfect society.

01:37:34.185 --> 01:37:35.596
My society.

01:37:36.521 --> 01:37:39.391
San Angeles will be a beacon of order...

01:37:40.191 --> 01:37:42.812
...with the purity of an ant colony.

01:37:43.653 --> 01:37:46.226
And the beauty of a flawless pearl.

01:37:47.073 --> 01:37:49.231
People have a right to be assholes.

01:37:51.702 --> 01:37:53.197
You remind me of...

01:37:53.955 --> 01:37:55.579
...an evil Mr. Rogers.

01:37:55.790 --> 01:37:57.367
Will you please kill him?

01:37:57.458 --> 01:37:59.000
He's pissing me off.

01:38:09.679 --> 01:38:11.837
Put another log on the fire!

01:38:13.432 --> 01:38:15.555
I'll love running this place!

01:38:22.817 --> 01:38:24.275
Well, now...

01:38:24.568 --> 01:38:26.810
...what shall I do with you?

01:38:28.531 --> 01:38:31.022
I am an excellent associate, sir.

01:38:31.617 --> 01:38:35.567
I'd be delighted to continue my services
during your administration.

01:38:36.747 --> 01:38:38.075
Maybe we'd use...

01:38:38.165 --> 01:38:40.205
Excuse me, the police are here.

01:38:41.460 --> 01:38:42.740
Oh, man!

01:39:08.779 --> 01:39:10.855
What the hell are you doing?

01:39:28.965 --> 01:39:30.341
I'm impressed.

01:39:43.897 --> 01:39:46.222
That man has died by my hands.

01:39:46.941 --> 01:39:48.649
It was either him or us.

01:39:50.111 --> 01:39:51.605
There is that.

01:39:51.821 --> 01:39:54.063
Where'd you learn to kick like that?

01:39:55.325 --> 01:39:57.116
Jackie Chan movies.

01:40:05.585 --> 01:40:08.539
Looks like the Cocteau plan
went up in smoke.

01:40:09.005 --> 01:40:11.377
Rest in peace, Raymond Cocteau.

01:40:12.383 --> 01:40:16.333
John Spartan, civilization as we know it
will come to an end.

01:40:17.388 --> 01:40:18.503
What will we do?

01:40:18.598 --> 01:40:21.171
I don't know. But this is better for you.

01:40:21.350 --> 01:40:22.809
What's that?

01:40:27.690 --> 01:40:29.149
This is bad.

01:40:29.442 --> 01:40:30.687
This is very bad.

01:40:30.776 --> 01:40:34.774
He's accessed the cryo-prison
and is about to defrost the multi-lifers.

01:40:34.906 --> 01:40:36.400
They don't like you.

01:40:36.574 --> 01:40:40.073
Most of these guys don't like
their own mothers. They're bad boys.

01:40:40.161 --> 01:40:41.619
How many are there?

01:40:44.832 --> 01:40:45.828
Eighty.

01:40:46.125 --> 01:40:47.536
All without rehab.

01:40:47.626 --> 01:40:49.584
They'll be re-animated within the hour.

01:40:49.670 --> 01:40:51.414
We must stop this.

01:40:53.299 --> 01:40:57.711
I'm not at all pleased about having caused
the fatality of a convict.

01:40:57.970 --> 01:41:02.181
I now understand that under certain
circumstances violence is necessary.

01:41:02.391 --> 01:41:03.554
Good.

01:41:08.272 --> 01:41:10.430
I hope you understand this.

01:41:19.408 --> 01:41:21.733
I hope my butt didn't look like that.

01:41:21.910 --> 01:41:24.662
Okay, who do we have left that's good?

01:41:24.830 --> 01:41:25.993
Let's see...

01:41:26.123 --> 01:41:27.617
...Foulks, Patrick.

01:41:27.791 --> 01:41:30.282
Jeffrey Dahmer? I love that guy.

01:41:31.378 --> 01:41:33.086
How long before the rest are done?

01:41:33.172 --> 01:41:35.164
They're in the final stages of reanimation.

01:41:35.257 --> 01:41:37.084
Great. Absolutely great.

01:41:38.886 --> 01:41:40.000
Gentlemen!

01:41:40.554 --> 01:41:44.005
Thank you, but your services
are no longer required.

01:41:51.106 --> 01:41:53.514
Send a maniac to catch a maniac.

01:42:11.710 --> 01:42:13.038
Attention.

01:42:13.211 --> 01:42:14.586
Attention.

01:42:14.671 --> 01:42:17.458
Cryo-prisoner defrosting
re-animation sequence...

01:42:17.549 --> 01:42:19.791
...now entering final stage.

01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:24.839
Count down to reanimation
of prisoner batches...

01:42:25.056 --> 01:42:26.848
...290, 310, 480...

01:42:29.144 --> 01:42:30.389
...570.

01:42:30.728 --> 01:42:32.139
Ten minutes.

01:42:34.232 --> 01:42:36.901
- That's it. The very last one.
- Excellent.

01:42:38.361 --> 01:42:39.689
Accessed.

01:42:41.406 --> 01:42:43.149
What the hell is that?

01:43:19.735 --> 01:43:21.858
Didn't expect that, did you?

01:43:22.238 --> 01:43:23.649
Where are you going?

01:43:23.739 --> 01:43:25.648
I wish you the best of luck.

01:43:26.659 --> 01:43:27.655
Stupid.

01:43:35.376 --> 01:43:37.084
How's it hanging?

01:43:38.671 --> 01:43:41.790
I'm sure you're familiar
with the long arm of the law.

01:43:46.804 --> 01:43:49.888
Why don't you struggle a little bit?
Make me work for it!

01:43:49.973 --> 01:43:51.847
What do you say? How about...

01:43:51.934 --> 01:43:55.018
...a little target practice. What do you say?

01:44:03.237 --> 01:44:04.945
Did that hurt your head?

01:44:25.258 --> 01:44:26.836
Shit! Goddamn!

01:44:34.434 --> 01:44:35.348
Fuck!

01:44:47.447 --> 01:44:48.822
That's it!

01:44:49.366 --> 01:44:51.572
You won't get out of this one!

01:44:54.579 --> 01:44:57.200
I'll drop you in that vat of defrost...

01:44:57.373 --> 01:44:59.450
...and fry you like a chicken...

01:45:00.668 --> 01:45:03.753
...or with my little pinky,
drop your monkey ass...

01:45:06.382 --> 01:45:07.960
I'll be damned.

01:45:49.342 --> 01:45:50.622
Shit! Goddamn!

01:45:50.885 --> 01:45:51.881
What am I doing wrong?

01:45:52.094 --> 01:45:53.921
Cryo-prisoner re-animation...

01:45:54.055 --> 01:45:56.759
...sequence now entering final stage.

01:46:03.439 --> 01:46:06.144
"Is it cold in here, or is it just me?"

01:46:07.860 --> 01:46:09.319
Good memory.

01:46:15.659 --> 01:46:16.940
Come here!

01:46:17.369 --> 01:46:18.532
Shit!

01:46:29.381 --> 01:46:30.840
I hate cops!

01:46:35.179 --> 01:46:37.752
Look into my eyes. I'll see you in hell.

01:46:38.182 --> 01:46:39.130
Not.

01:47:22.350 --> 01:47:24.758
This is the best day of my life.

01:47:55.216 --> 01:47:56.544
Heads up!

01:48:47.518 --> 01:48:51.432
Did you apprehend the villain responsible
for murdering Cocteau?

01:48:51.647 --> 01:48:53.521
I wouldn't say "apprehend."

01:48:53.691 --> 01:48:55.185
But he's history.

01:48:55.442 --> 01:48:57.067
And the cryo-prison...

01:48:57.194 --> 01:48:58.653
...is history too.

01:49:01.615 --> 01:49:03.157
What'll we do?

01:49:04.118 --> 01:49:05.232
How will we live?

01:49:05.327 --> 01:49:09.076
We'll go out drinking,
get shit-faced and paint the town.

01:49:09.373 --> 01:49:11.579
Graffiti slogans, it'll be a blast.

01:49:12.084 --> 01:49:13.542
This is what you'll do.

01:49:13.627 --> 01:49:15.536
You'll get a little dirty...

01:49:15.629 --> 01:49:17.372
...you, a lot clean.

01:49:17.589 --> 01:49:19.712
And somewhere in the middle...

01:49:20.509 --> 01:49:22.382
You'll figure it out.

01:49:22.719 --> 01:49:23.917
Fucking-A!

01:49:27.099 --> 01:49:28.379
Well put.

01:49:29.976 --> 01:49:32.099
Greetings and salutations.

01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:34.643
I'm Associate Bob. And may I say...

01:49:34.815 --> 01:49:38.230
...it would be a pleasure
to help you create a more humane...

01:49:39.486 --> 01:49:41.229
Let's talk about the hair, okay?

01:49:41.321 --> 01:49:45.022
Pick a color. And lose the kimono.
You look like a couch.

01:49:45.158 --> 01:49:47.696
What are you, a surgeon
with these gloves?

01:49:51.706 --> 01:49:54.328
Thanks for rendering me unconscious.

01:49:56.336 --> 01:49:57.795
I did it for your own good.

01:49:57.879 --> 01:50:00.204
- We're supposed to be a team.
- We are.

01:50:09.182 --> 01:50:10.427
Oh, my.

01:50:11.226 --> 01:50:13.930
Are all fluid transfer activities like this?

01:50:14.062 --> 01:50:15.722
- Better.
- Better?

01:50:16.981 --> 01:50:18.179
Oh, my.

01:50:21.611 --> 01:50:23.603
I think I'll like the future.

01:50:23.780 --> 01:50:26.152
Now that you've demolished everything.

01:50:26.699 --> 01:50:29.024
But there's one thing I want to know.

01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:32.077
How's that damn
three-seashell thing work?

01:50:33.305 --> 01:50:39.882
