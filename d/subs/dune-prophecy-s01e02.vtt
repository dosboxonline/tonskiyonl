WEBVTT

02:36.364 --> 02:39.116
I appreciate the Suk School
allowing you to return here

02:39.117 --> 02:41.036
at such short notice.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.803
It's been a long time since
I studied here.

02:59.512 --> 03:02.057
But I'm still a Sister first.

03:05.101 --> 03:07.895
My initial scan found no evidence
of an accelerant.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.022
It wouldn't.
The heat source was internal.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.609
An acute imbalance
in her meridian network.

03:13.693 --> 03:16.195
Before this happened,
did you notice any physical changes?

03:16.196 --> 03:18.114
Any signs of distress?

03:22.786 --> 03:24.621
She had a nightmare.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.915
Whatever it was terrified her.

03:27.791 --> 03:29.125
She knew something was coming.

03:29.668 --> 03:31.336
I should have listened.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.215
If this is too difficult,
I can continue on my own.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.718
No, I need answers.

03:51.398 --> 03:53.357
How could something like this happen?

03:53.358 --> 03:55.067
The founding Sisters were willing to die

03:55.068 --> 03:57.987
if it meant following
in Raquella's footsteps.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.030
What is it with you and martyrs?

04:00.031 --> 04:02.157
If you're that eager to off yourself,
there are simpler ways.

04:02.158 --> 04:05.745
The Emperor's Truthsayer
killed just before the royal wedding.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.498
That's no coincidence.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.501
That's an assassination.

04:15.714 --> 04:17.757
You think someone attacked Kasha here?

04:19.009 --> 04:20.969
I'm saying I'd keep my guard up.

04:41.698 --> 04:44.325
The initial physical exam is inconclusive.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.202
Nazir is running more tests.

04:47.245 --> 04:48.663
The results will take time.

04:50.498 --> 04:52.709
I'm leaving for Salusa Secundus.

04:53.877 --> 04:56.588
- Now?
- A message came in with today's ship.

04:57.380 --> 04:58.965
Pruwet Richese is dead.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.634
Burned.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.763
A second attack? At the palace?

05:05.764 --> 05:07.057
Tula...

05:08.516 --> 05:11.478
this is the Burning Truth
Mother Raquella spoke of.

05:12.937 --> 05:14.897
I have to secure the princess.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.857
With Kasha gone,
someone has to fill the void

05:16.858 --> 05:18.859
and protect our plans.

05:18.860 --> 05:19.944
Go.

05:20.570 --> 05:21.946
I can take care of things here.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.537
You don't believe I'm up to the task.

05:30.538 --> 05:33.041
Emotions cloud judgment, Tula.

05:34.376 --> 05:36.920
Hard choices will have to be made.

05:37.837 --> 05:41.423
There is one that will give us
the greatest chance of success.

05:41.424 --> 05:44.177
When have I ever shied away
from hard choices?

05:44.969 --> 05:47.347
It's one that involves Lila.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.018
She needs to connect with her ancestors.

05:53.019 --> 05:54.395
She hasn't had the training.

05:54.396 --> 05:56.063
We've never seen a force like this.

05:56.064 --> 05:57.898
We don't know how to fight it.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.192
You can't accept this
because you care for the girl.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.987
- I raised her.
- But she's not your child.

06:07.742 --> 06:11.538
She is the one who can give us
the answers we need.

06:13.123 --> 06:16.334
We must understand
how this prophecy will unfold.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.002
It's dangerous,

06:18.003 --> 06:21.589
but if you lead her, she'll make it.

06:22.465 --> 06:24.050
You've done it before.

06:27.846 --> 06:30.390
The school is yours until I return.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.269
Putting Lila through the Agony

06:35.270 --> 06:37.689
endangers not just her life.

06:38.648 --> 06:41.901
There are secrets we have gone
to great lengths to keep.

06:42.402 --> 06:46.823
You, me, Francesca, Kasha.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.788
It's a risk we'll have to take.

07:09.095 --> 07:12.515
Sister Theodosia, a word.

07:22.442 --> 07:26.279
I'm departing for Salusa Secundus.
I want you to accompany me.

07:27.072 --> 07:30.033
You're aware of my circumstances?

07:32.577 --> 07:35.038
I wouldn't ask if the situation
weren't dire.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.626
- When do we leave?
- Immediately.

08:11.991 --> 08:13.410
Where is he?

08:16.621 --> 08:19.415
The Emperor regrets he can't be here
to offer his condolences.

08:19.416 --> 08:21.750
He'll join us as soon as he can.

08:21.751 --> 08:23.461
How convenient.

08:24.212 --> 08:26.505
Duke Richese,
we're all devastated by this tragedy,

08:26.506 --> 08:28.425
Javicco included.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.176
Look at him.

08:31.845 --> 08:33.054
Look

08:33.680 --> 08:35.390
at my boy

08:36.641 --> 08:38.184
and tell me that a toy did this.

08:41.312 --> 08:43.564
I understand your anger

08:43.565 --> 08:47.067
but you, along with everyone,
know the risks of thinking machines.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.194
They're unpredictable.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.822
He should never have had one
to begin with.

08:53.908 --> 08:57.786
Before you insinuate
that this is my fault,

08:57.787 --> 09:01.415
you may want to remind yourself
that there is a fleet of fighters

09:01.416 --> 09:05.794
in orbit around this planet,
and that it is still mine.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.422
All I'm saying is, accidents happen.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.466
This one was particularly appalling.

09:10.467 --> 09:12.344
We're all in shock.

09:15.347 --> 09:16.931
Now, if you'll excuse me.

09:36.117 --> 09:38.578
It seems tragedy follows you.

09:39.371 --> 09:41.163
First, your men on Arrakis,

09:41.164 --> 09:43.208
now a death as you arrive here
at the palace.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.877
I wouldn't call it a tragedy.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.673
You don't have to pretend with me,
Your Majesty.

09:50.382 --> 09:52.508
You made your feelings
regarding Pruwet Richese

09:52.509 --> 09:54.134
and the wedding very clear.

09:54.135 --> 09:55.970
No, no, no.

09:56.763 --> 10:00.392
No, when we spoke, if I

10:01.476 --> 10:03.687
made any indication,

10:04.771 --> 10:07.649
you must understand,
I was expressing a private concern.

10:15.824 --> 10:16.658
Of course.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.494
I did not tell you to kill that boy.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.330
But you wanted me to.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.792
What I did, I did for you.

10:26.835 --> 10:28.420
And I can do it again.

10:31.840 --> 10:35.260
No, no. No, this is...

10:38.179 --> 10:39.597
this is madness.

10:42.767 --> 10:43.768
Guards!

10:47.147 --> 10:48.189
Arrest him.

10:53.653 --> 10:54.904
Take him to the suspensor cells.

11:02.537 --> 11:04.121
Keep it quiet. Not a word gets out.

11:04.122 --> 11:06.332
I'll handle it personally, Your Majesty.

11:47.415 --> 11:50.376
<i>Do you know why we separate
infants from their mothers</i>

11:50.377 --> 11:52.003
<i>when a Sister gives birth?</i>

11:52.587 --> 11:56.007
It prevents bonds that one might hold
above the Sisterhood.

11:56.508 --> 11:59.511
That way, we're all equals
to one another.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.681
Why are you asking me?

12:05.058 --> 12:07.060
Before Mother Raquella died...

12:08.895 --> 12:11.314
she experienced a moment

12:11.940 --> 12:13.149
of prescience.

12:13.775 --> 12:17.361
With her last breath,
she prophesized Tiran-Arafel,

12:17.362 --> 12:21.156
a tyrannical force
that we would have to reckon with

12:21.157 --> 12:22.492
that could well destroy us.

12:23.451 --> 12:25.870
Destroy the Sisterhood?

12:30.417 --> 12:32.252
We believe that reckoning is here,

12:32.919 --> 12:36.630
that a new enemy has emerged
to undermine our power.

12:36.631 --> 12:39.134
That's what killed Mother Kasha?

12:41.928 --> 12:43.096
What can we do?

12:47.308 --> 12:48.727
Not us.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.146
You.

12:55.150 --> 12:58.903
We need you to talk to Mother Raquella.

12:59.404 --> 13:01.990
We think she will know how to fight it.

13:02.532 --> 13:03.825
Raquella?

13:08.955 --> 13:11.166
- I'm--
- You...

13:11.875 --> 13:14.836
are her great-great-granddaughter.

13:18.548 --> 13:23.927
If you unlock your genetic memory,
you might be able to access her.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.930
And she can tell us more details
about her premonition.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.642
It takes years to prepare for the Agony.

13:30.101 --> 13:31.311
I...

13:32.062 --> 13:33.688
I only just started.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.068
It is a great risk.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.738
But few have your natural aptitude

13:42.364 --> 13:45.200
and I believe that you can do it.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.496
But it must be your choice.

14:11.851 --> 14:15.647
The stories of your prowess
have transcended time and space.

14:16.606 --> 14:19.191
I've always wondered if they were true.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.194
Am I failing to live up to expectations?

14:22.195 --> 14:25.281
I could use a little more convincing.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.367
Is that so?

15:32.599 --> 15:34.225
Have I proven myself?

15:35.477 --> 15:38.897
Oh, with honor, my dear prince.

15:54.662 --> 15:57.290
I suppose there are worse ways to grieve.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.334
You won't catch me shedding a tear.

16:00.085 --> 16:02.127
I barely knew the little brat.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.630
Father kept us on different planets.

16:04.631 --> 16:08.718
Mine was located in a more remote region
of the universe.

16:10.595 --> 16:13.390
Still, whatever was done to him

16:14.474 --> 16:17.352
did seem especially cruel.

16:18.269 --> 16:21.272
I doubt my family will
ever make peace with it.

16:23.942 --> 16:27.654
And the timing was unfortunate.

16:29.781 --> 16:31.949
Should I be making a hasty retreat then?

16:31.950 --> 16:34.618
Will the Duke use the fleet
to seize the throne

16:34.619 --> 16:35.995
now that he can't marry into it?

16:40.458 --> 16:42.460
The palace is meaningless.

16:43.545 --> 16:47.882
The real power is whoever controls
the desert planet.

16:49.759 --> 16:53.430
The Great Houses, the Spacing Guild,
the Sisterhood.

16:55.390 --> 16:57.225
They all know that.

16:57.767 --> 17:02.731
What matters is those beautiful,
little flecks of orange dust.

17:09.070 --> 17:10.321
Arrakis.

17:11.364 --> 17:13.366
That's where he's from.

17:18.788 --> 17:19.789
Who?

17:23.335 --> 17:25.545
The soldier in custody.

17:26.629 --> 17:29.257
My father thinks I don't pay attention

17:30.216 --> 17:33.303
but I saw our Swordmaster
take him into the cells.

17:35.096 --> 17:36.890
Is this about my brother?

17:47.442 --> 17:49.944
What does your father plan
to do with the fleet?

17:50.820 --> 17:52.280
Haven't you been listening?

17:53.573 --> 17:55.867
He doesn't confide in me.

17:59.913 --> 18:02.123
Another pinch and I'll be useless.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.710
I wouldn't say useless.

18:20.892 --> 18:22.060
This is a disaster.

18:23.061 --> 18:24.938
This is an absolute disaster.

18:25.397 --> 18:28.024
The boy was burned alive
by one of my soldiers.

18:28.817 --> 18:30.109
Soldier from Arrakis?

18:30.110 --> 18:31.986
- Yes.
- How?

18:33.363 --> 18:35.656
He claims to have been swallowed
by a sandworm.

18:35.657 --> 18:38.325
- Claims?
- It's on the surveillance.

18:38.326 --> 18:41.913
You're telling me Desmond Hart
survived an attack by Shai-Hulud?

18:44.958 --> 18:46.001
Yes.

18:46.751 --> 18:50.005
He says the worm gave him a gift.

18:50.672 --> 18:51.839
Some sort of power.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.633
I don't know.
He's obviously insane.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.724
You know who will be blamed for this?

19:01.599 --> 19:03.935
If Richese finds out,
he'll think I issued the order.

19:06.187 --> 19:08.564
Kasha didn't trust that soldier.

19:08.565 --> 19:11.359
- Where was she when I needed her?
- Be calm, Javicco.

19:12.152 --> 19:14.611
We must proceed carefully,
but we can handle this.

19:14.612 --> 19:16.071
And how do you suggest we do that?

19:16.072 --> 19:17.406
Well, you saw the boy's body.

19:17.407 --> 19:19.075
His death was unnatural.

19:21.494 --> 19:22.995
Desmond Hart could still have value.

19:22.996 --> 19:24.496
What do you mean?

19:24.497 --> 19:26.707
There are many who would turn
their weapons against us,

19:26.708 --> 19:29.419
and this man pledges his in our defense.

19:30.920 --> 19:33.505
All I am saying is,
let's not rush to execute

19:33.506 --> 19:36.801
our friends to please our enemies.

20:12.671 --> 20:13.838
What?

20:17.050 --> 20:21.304
Did you mean what you said
about making sacrifices,

20:21.846 --> 20:23.682
becoming a martyr?

20:28.770 --> 20:29.937
At the end of the war,

20:29.938 --> 20:32.940
my family was on the ground
with Rayna Butler

20:32.941 --> 20:34.234
in the Battle of Corrin.

20:35.485 --> 20:37.403
They knew they wouldn't survive

20:37.404 --> 20:40.864
but they bought enough time for the fleets
to come in with pulse atomics

20:40.865 --> 20:42.617
and end the machines for good.

20:44.202 --> 20:46.204
Human life is sacred.

20:46.955 --> 20:49.457
That's why there's no greater honor
than to give it.

20:51.501 --> 20:53.669
And we shouldn't be afraid

20:53.670 --> 20:57.047
because in death,
we'll be reunited with our foremothers.

20:57.048 --> 20:58.299
You really believe that?

21:05.098 --> 21:08.768
Reverend Mothers know better than anyone
that the dead aren't gone.

21:11.229 --> 21:13.273
I wish I was so sure about things.

21:26.536 --> 21:28.371
Mother Tula,

21:31.166 --> 21:33.585
you're preparing the Rossak poison.

21:35.170 --> 21:36.962
It's my own experiment.

21:36.963 --> 21:39.173
Is this for one of our acolytes?

21:39.174 --> 21:41.343
Are they undergoing the Agony?

21:45.013 --> 21:47.181
You can report to Valya

21:47.182 --> 21:50.060
that Sister Lila will be
making her own decision.

21:50.977 --> 21:54.646
And no matter how many spies she sends,
she cannot control everything.

21:54.647 --> 21:57.359
Mother Valya is right to be concerned.

21:58.151 --> 22:01.404
You can't leave the fate of the Imperium
in the hands of one child.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.240
She has the right to choose for herself.

22:05.784 --> 22:09.037
But it's not just Lila's life
that hangs in the balance, is it?

22:11.664 --> 22:14.334
It's the lives of all the women
within these walls.

23:14.811 --> 23:17.521
You're about to meet
the most powerful people in the Imperium.

23:17.522 --> 23:20.692
Every single one of them
has their own agenda

23:21.693 --> 23:24.153
but only one of them is your mission.

23:24.154 --> 23:25.655
The princess.

23:27.115 --> 23:29.117
Make yourself her confidant.

23:30.785 --> 23:32.870
Where is the royal detail?

23:32.871 --> 23:34.539
I didn't tell them we were coming.

23:35.290 --> 23:37.459
Best to catch them unprepared.

23:38.835 --> 23:41.211
What about the Richese situation?

23:41.212 --> 23:43.298
That matter is mine to resolve.

23:50.513 --> 23:51.890
<i>Where is he?</i>

23:52.849 --> 23:55.684
Where is the man who killed my son?

23:55.685 --> 23:57.227
I've already ordered

23:57.228 --> 23:59.396
- a full investigation.
- I know you're hiding him!

23:59.397 --> 24:03.275
Your idiot bastard let it slip!
One of your own soldiers!

24:03.276 --> 24:06.820
I demand you give this suspect to me
and let my people interrogate him

24:06.821 --> 24:09.114
or our contract is void!

24:09.115 --> 24:10.658
Duke Richese,

24:11.826 --> 24:14.245
I've made allowances for your grief.

24:14.829 --> 24:17.581
You wanted an audience,
I've granted you one,

24:17.582 --> 24:19.459
but do not presume to tell me--

24:27.092 --> 24:28.510
Your Majesty.

24:32.138 --> 24:34.808
Mother Superior. This is unexpected.

24:40.188 --> 24:42.607
I came as soon as I heard the news.

24:43.900 --> 24:46.694
Ferdinand, Orla,
there can be no greater tragedy

24:46.695 --> 24:49.071
than that of a promising life
cut short.

24:49.072 --> 24:50.907
The Sisterhood mourns with you.

24:51.908 --> 24:54.619
We all feel the loss of our shared future.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.872
But your information is wrong.

25:01.126 --> 25:05.338
There is no suspect being held in relation
to the death of your son.

25:08.091 --> 25:09.175
If you're lying,

25:10.927 --> 25:14.180
I will take my ships
and your spice operation.

25:15.015 --> 25:17.933
Perhaps, then,
you'll understand the future you've lost.

25:17.934 --> 25:22.814
My Duke, let's not allow our grief
to control our conversation.

25:23.481 --> 25:25.483
Mother Superior is here.

25:27.986 --> 25:29.195
Fine,

25:30.405 --> 25:32.449
but this is not over.

25:36.828 --> 25:39.706
We should take his tongue
for that insolence.

25:40.915 --> 25:42.125
Leave us.

25:45.337 --> 25:46.296
Where is Kasha?

25:47.297 --> 25:50.382
I know she's keeping me in the dark
about this uprising on Arrakis,

25:50.383 --> 25:51.800
but I want to know why.

25:51.801 --> 25:54.136
- Was it by your order?
- Your Majesty,

25:54.137 --> 25:56.389
I have to be the bearer of terrible news.

25:56.890 --> 25:59.851
- Kasha Jinjo is dead.
- She's what?

26:00.477 --> 26:02.103
She was burned.

26:02.562 --> 26:04.564
- A fire?
- No.

26:05.982 --> 26:07.984
From the inside.

26:10.945 --> 26:14.157
I wish to question the suspect
in Pruwet Richese's murder.

26:17.035 --> 26:17.869
As I said,

26:19.662 --> 26:21.039
there is no suspect.

26:23.667 --> 26:26.460
Your Majesty,
whatever reasons you have

26:26.461 --> 26:28.629
for keeping this truth from the Duke,

26:28.630 --> 26:30.840
I'm sure they're well-intentioned

26:31.633 --> 26:33.927
but you are holding someone
regarding this murder.

26:34.678 --> 26:36.388
And if he is behind the boy's death,

26:37.389 --> 26:40.392
I believe he may be behind
Mother Kasha's death as well.

26:46.064 --> 26:47.272
The man is my prisoner.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.275
- I will deal with him.
- Javicco...

26:49.901 --> 26:51.652
it's not every day we are fortunate enough

26:51.653 --> 26:53.237
to have the Mother Superior
of the Sisterhood

26:53.238 --> 26:54.948
as our personal Truthsayer.

26:59.285 --> 27:00.495
Very well.

27:03.331 --> 27:05.500
My wife has always been
a champion of debate.

27:06.167 --> 27:07.335
So be it.

27:07.752 --> 27:09.713
You can have your interrogation.

27:18.722 --> 27:21.766
<i>No, that can't be true.</i>

27:27.897 --> 27:29.691
Remember your practice.

27:31.693 --> 27:33.653
Step outside your body.

27:37.657 --> 27:42.454
Allow your awareness
to extend to your nerves,

27:43.830 --> 27:46.416
to the flow of your blood.

28:01.056 --> 28:01.973
Good.

28:06.936 --> 28:09.981
Kasha was proud of the woman
you've become, Princess Ynez.

28:11.483 --> 28:15.653
She wrote to us, told us how well you were
excelling in your studies.

28:16.279 --> 28:20.867
She was sure that, one day,
you would become a Reverend Mother,

28:21.743 --> 28:24.037
and I can see now that that's true.

28:28.541 --> 28:30.335
Take me away from here, please.

28:30.919 --> 28:32.795
I still want to go with you and study.

28:32.796 --> 28:34.297
The Sisterhood wants that for you too.

28:34.964 --> 28:36.758
I must confer with your father.

28:38.051 --> 28:39.511
In the meantime,

28:40.095 --> 28:42.097
Sister Theodosia will take care of you.

28:42.806 --> 28:45.183
She's one of our most promising acolytes.

28:46.351 --> 28:48.060
You and she were set to be dormmates.

28:48.061 --> 28:50.730
- And you may still be.
- We will be.

28:51.523 --> 28:53.233
I'm sure of it.

29:04.577 --> 29:05.995
So what do you want to know?

29:06.955 --> 29:09.207
I can tell you about our classes.

29:09.874 --> 29:11.667
The library's amazing.

29:11.668 --> 29:13.585
Some volumes date back
to the use of wood pulp.

29:13.586 --> 29:16.840
I want you to tell me
exactly how Kasha died.

29:45.702 --> 29:47.328
Desmond Hart.

29:48.580 --> 29:50.790
Who are you, really?

29:51.583 --> 29:53.625
Nothing but a soldier of the Imperium.

29:53.626 --> 29:56.338
Oh, come now, you're more than that.

29:57.714 --> 30:00.342
I wouldn't dare lie to you,
Mother Superior.

30:03.219 --> 30:04.846
Where are you from?

30:06.014 --> 30:07.223
Balut.

30:10.143 --> 30:12.354
Harsh world for a child.

30:15.690 --> 30:17.525
What brought you to the palace?

30:20.612 --> 30:21.905
Faith.

30:23.239 --> 30:25.532
I would advise against
playing games with me.

30:25.533 --> 30:26.743
I will win.

30:28.244 --> 30:30.246
I have nothing to hide.

30:31.539 --> 30:33.541
Can you and your Sisters say the same?

30:34.334 --> 30:37.420
- I'm not the one in the cell.
- Not yet.

30:39.005 --> 30:41.048
Did you kill Pruwet Richese?

30:41.049 --> 30:42.342
I did.

30:44.094 --> 30:46.679
- You admit to treason?
- I admit to justice.

30:46.680 --> 30:49.599
On whose authority
did you pass that sentence?

31:02.946 --> 31:05.156
Did you kill Reverend Mother Kasha?

31:05.782 --> 31:07.991
She was unworthy
to stand beside the Emperor.

31:07.992 --> 31:10.203
I saw the corruption in her heart.

31:11.121 --> 31:14.165
The same way I see the blood trailing
your every step.

31:24.134 --> 31:25.343
"See"?

31:29.431 --> 31:30.932
How do you mean?

31:32.017 --> 31:35.728
Shai-Hulud took my eye
and granted me with a gift

31:35.729 --> 31:38.023
to see what even you cannot.

31:40.108 --> 31:41.692
Who do you serve?

31:41.693 --> 31:43.278
The Imperium.

31:44.696 --> 31:46.906
And only the Imperium.

31:57.459 --> 32:01.462
He speaks truth as he believes it,
but what he claims is a lie.

32:01.463 --> 32:03.590
I saw your Truthsayer for what she was.

32:04.215 --> 32:07.384
She undermined your instincts
and chipped away at your power

32:07.385 --> 32:09.845
until you had to grovel before lesser men.

32:09.846 --> 32:12.222
Emperor, by his own admission,
this man is a murderer.

32:12.223 --> 32:14.726
Thank you, Mother Superior.

32:15.268 --> 32:17.353
I think we've heard all we need to.

32:17.354 --> 32:18.812
You've given us much to consider.

32:18.813 --> 32:20.523
What's to consider?

32:21.775 --> 32:23.777
He sabotaged the wedding

32:24.402 --> 32:27.030
and murdered the woman
who'd seen through his lies.

32:30.158 --> 32:32.160
Halfway across the universe,

32:33.536 --> 32:35.538
in the same timespan?

32:37.165 --> 32:40.001
I leave it to you to explain to me how.

32:41.753 --> 32:44.964
Until there is proof,
I command you to keep this to yourself.

32:45.632 --> 32:48.385
This would turn the Imperium
into a circus of

32:49.177 --> 32:50.762
fear and rumor.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.352
That is all.

32:57.769 --> 32:59.979
Return the prisoner to suspension.

33:20.375 --> 33:22.543
- Once I--
- You need to get the Duke in hand.

33:22.544 --> 33:24.294
My counsel has its limits,

33:24.295 --> 33:27.006
especially under such exceptional
circumstances.

33:27.007 --> 33:28.383
I don't care how you do it.

33:29.009 --> 33:31.135
He needs to be brought to heel.

33:31.136 --> 33:33.013
What of Desmond Hart?

33:34.305 --> 33:36.265
I don't know what's behind him yet

33:36.266 --> 33:39.436
but his goal is, clearly,
to get close to the throne.

33:40.687 --> 33:43.106
We cannot afford to lose the fleet.

33:44.065 --> 33:48.445
Corrino is slipping through our grasp,
and he needs to be reminded of our value.

33:48.945 --> 33:51.405
I'm speaking with him later tonight.

33:51.406 --> 33:54.826
But first, I have to meet
with one of our contacts in Zimia.

34:14.971 --> 34:17.515
So, you're descended from our founder?

34:19.059 --> 34:21.478
I can't say you look much like her.

34:24.647 --> 34:27.942
Mother Tula says what happened to Kasha
was a part of a reckoning

34:29.235 --> 34:31.446
that threatens the Sisterhood.

34:32.489 --> 34:36.368
They need Raquella to clarify her vision
to help them fight it.

34:38.995 --> 34:40.413
I can be the link.

34:41.289 --> 34:42.539
I owe them so much.

34:42.540 --> 34:43.750
Don't be ridiculous.

34:44.501 --> 34:46.336
They're using you.

34:47.504 --> 34:49.172
It's all they tell us.

34:50.382 --> 34:52.384
"Sisterhood above all."

34:54.302 --> 34:55.970
Not Sisters.

34:56.680 --> 34:58.682
They don't care about you.

34:59.265 --> 35:01.308
Not like they care about
the Order as a whole.

35:01.309 --> 35:03.269
I care about the Order too.

35:05.563 --> 35:07.190
This is my home.

35:08.149 --> 35:09.567
My family.

35:10.610 --> 35:12.070
I believe in our mission.

35:12.487 --> 35:14.739
Hard to have a mission when you're dead.

35:58.199 --> 36:00.159
I'm sorry! Just tell me what I can do.

36:00.160 --> 36:02.245
You can keep your mouth shut!

36:02.829 --> 36:04.956
And go back to playing your baliset.

36:26.603 --> 36:29.773
The proceeds from the Arrakis haul.

36:31.649 --> 36:34.026
Not counting what your spice smugglers
took off the top.

36:34.027 --> 36:36.905
Well, not everyone's motivated
by loyalty to the cause.

36:46.456 --> 36:49.750
Look who it is.
Straighten up, everyone.

36:49.751 --> 36:52.878
You're in the presence
of the Emperor's own Swordmaster.

36:52.879 --> 36:57.383
Direct descendant
of distinguished war hero Vorian Atreides.

36:57.384 --> 36:58.676
Shut up, Horace,

36:58.677 --> 37:00.720
or I'll stick my distinguished foot
up your ass.

37:05.475 --> 37:09.061
- How was the funeral?
- The whole palace was distracted.

37:09.062 --> 37:11.356
I got the full layout,
even the throne room.

37:11.940 --> 37:13.775
No one noticed a thing.

37:25.036 --> 37:26.412
Good work.

37:26.413 --> 37:28.498
We need one final piece.

37:30.125 --> 37:32.544
Then we strike against Corrino himself.

37:34.754 --> 37:36.589
Are you certain now's the right time?

37:38.133 --> 37:39.800
The princess's wedding shattered.

37:39.801 --> 37:41.969
There's a lot of sympathy
out there among people.

37:41.970 --> 37:45.305
Sounds like someone's grown too accustomed
to the comforts of the palace.

37:45.306 --> 37:46.724
Trading off that famous name to--

37:46.725 --> 37:48.726
I pledged my sword
and my name to the rebellion

37:48.727 --> 37:51.478
because the Great Houses
are hoarding spice,

37:51.479 --> 37:55.399
forcing the people to turn to violence
to get what they need to survive.

37:55.400 --> 37:57.568
If the only way to stop this is
to spill blood,

37:57.569 --> 38:01.531
then don't doubt, for a second,
my allegiance to the cause.

38:02.032 --> 38:03.949
See that Atreides fire?

38:03.950 --> 38:05.325
That's the spirit we need

38:05.326 --> 38:08.038
if we're gonna clear those criminals out
of the Landsraad.

38:11.041 --> 38:14.044
We have been ground under their boots
for too long.

38:16.129 --> 38:20.133
We need to announce this rebellion
in a way that cannot be ignored.

38:26.556 --> 38:27.766
Let's get a drink.

38:35.857 --> 38:40.612
He might trust you, but I saw you
the other night with the princess.

38:41.446 --> 38:44.949
Be careful.
We can't afford any liabilities.

38:54.376 --> 38:55.959
<i>You know something?</i>

38:55.960 --> 38:58.463
<i>All these years that I've grown up here
at the Sisterhood,</i>

38:59.297 --> 39:01.758
I used to pretend you were my mother.

39:03.635 --> 39:06.054
Well, I'll tell you a secret, so did I.

39:08.431 --> 39:11.559
Why do you think I gave you
my most precious keepsake?

39:14.729 --> 39:16.940
I wish you could've known her.

39:18.233 --> 39:19.566
You...

39:19.567 --> 39:21.027
You knew my mother?

39:22.028 --> 39:23.029
Yes.

39:24.864 --> 39:26.241
Where is she now?

39:29.452 --> 39:30.662
She died. I'm sorry.

39:31.871 --> 39:33.873
She died giving birth.

39:42.716 --> 39:48.095
Then, she would be there,
in my other memory.

39:48.096 --> 39:51.515
You can't tame the other memory.

39:51.516 --> 39:54.269
You can't predict what voices
will come when you unlock it.

39:54.853 --> 39:58.439
It would be a lie if I promised you
that you would see your mother.

39:58.440 --> 40:01.317
- But she could be?
- She could be.

40:03.528 --> 40:05.530
But if you're not ready,

40:07.574 --> 40:09.993
we can find other options.

40:52.035 --> 40:54.286
Good to see you, Sister Mikaela.

40:54.287 --> 40:57.207
I'm sorry the circumstances
aren't better.

40:59.084 --> 41:01.503
I honestly couldn't
believe it when I heard.

41:02.379 --> 41:04.381
You know, I idolized Kasha.

41:06.049 --> 41:08.092
All that power she wielded
at the Emperor's side

41:08.093 --> 41:09.761
instead of in the shadows.

41:10.470 --> 41:12.681
The shadows hold power too.

41:13.556 --> 41:15.140
I know that now.

41:15.141 --> 41:17.018
The push and pull.

41:18.103 --> 41:20.979
We empower the Great Houses
to maintain order

41:20.980 --> 41:24.067
and allow rebellion
to keep that power in check.

41:24.567 --> 41:26.360
The rebel attack on the harvester

41:26.361 --> 41:28.612
was a beautiful manipulation.

41:28.613 --> 41:29.530
Thank you.

41:29.531 --> 41:31.824
But now,
I need the names of all the rebels

41:31.825 --> 41:33.618
involved in the raids on Arrakis.

41:34.536 --> 41:37.037
Wait, you wanna burn the whole cell?

41:37.038 --> 41:39.248
Well, we have to shore up
our influence,

41:39.249 --> 41:41.500
assuage the Emperor's fears.

41:41.501 --> 41:44.378
His weakness is no longer an advantage.

41:44.379 --> 41:48.091
We have to bolster him now
to ward off the predators.

41:49.676 --> 41:52.095
You can start with their spy
in the palace.

41:52.971 --> 41:54.264
Name's Keiran Atreides.

41:56.266 --> 41:57.684
Atreides?

41:58.309 --> 42:00.311
What, does that pose an issue?

42:02.939 --> 42:03.940
No.

42:35.263 --> 42:36.890
Nice maneuver.

42:38.808 --> 42:40.310
Clearly, you've been practicin'.

42:41.227 --> 42:42.854
Just nothin' I taught you.

42:44.314 --> 42:46.983
Don't know whether to be offended
or impressed.

42:47.609 --> 42:48.984
Kasha taught me a few moves

42:48.985 --> 42:51.529
to get me prepared
for when I enter the school.

42:54.115 --> 42:55.658
Do you wanna talk about it?

42:56.743 --> 42:58.328
I don't wanna talk.

42:59.996 --> 43:01.581
Then let's not talk.

43:37.200 --> 43:39.828
- Did I hurt you?
- I'm fine.

43:43.373 --> 43:45.208
I just keep seeing them.

43:47.002 --> 43:49.838
Kasha and Pruwet.

43:50.714 --> 43:52.340
He was just a kid.

43:57.178 --> 44:00.432
When I was his age,
my father faced a rebellion

44:00.974 --> 44:02.850
on one of the far planets.

44:02.851 --> 44:05.395
I remember. The Broken Chain.

44:07.230 --> 44:10.442
They were one world. A moon, actually.

44:11.317 --> 44:14.154
They could hardly hold their own
against the Imperial Army.

44:15.989 --> 44:17.615
So, one night,

44:19.200 --> 44:21.619
some of them broke into the palace

44:23.496 --> 44:25.415
and stole me from my bed.

44:26.249 --> 44:28.460
Constantine couldn't stop them

44:29.502 --> 44:31.921
so he told them to take him too.

44:32.922 --> 44:34.506
I've never heard this before.

44:34.507 --> 44:37.593
My parents didn't want to look weak
to the Great Houses,

44:37.594 --> 44:39.679
so they covered it up.

44:41.222 --> 44:43.641
And Constantine,
he never speaks about it.

44:46.936 --> 44:48.813
It was all politics.

44:51.566 --> 44:54.194
We are all just pieces on the board

44:55.153 --> 44:57.364
to be played in the pursuit of power

44:57.781 --> 44:59.240
and spice.

45:21.012 --> 45:22.013
We can't.

45:24.057 --> 45:26.685
It was one thing when
I was leaving the planet, but...

45:29.646 --> 45:30.855
You're right.

45:32.107 --> 45:34.109
Be bad for both of us.

46:07.100 --> 46:10.186
Are you a prophet, Desmond Hart?

46:11.062 --> 46:13.690
Not long ago, I would've laughed at that.

46:14.774 --> 46:16.234
I believed in nothing.

46:16.860 --> 46:18.069
And now?

46:19.779 --> 46:21.197
I don't know.

46:24.367 --> 46:26.786
There are things that I can do...

46:29.372 --> 46:30.790
beautiful...

46:32.917 --> 46:34.919
terrible things.

46:36.838 --> 46:38.797
I think if you were given a gift
you should use it,

46:38.798 --> 46:40.884
lest it be taken away.

46:42.260 --> 46:46.221
Duke Richese is reclaiming his fleet
and has threatened to seize Arrakis.

46:46.222 --> 46:49.642
Why not just deliver you to him
and solve all our problems?

46:50.143 --> 46:52.145
I am still a soldier.

46:54.022 --> 46:56.649
I am at your mercy and your command.

46:58.735 --> 47:01.528
Why not let me show you
how I would humble those

47:01.529 --> 47:04.114
who tried to take from you,

47:04.115 --> 47:07.202
or sway you with corrupt counsel?

47:14.501 --> 47:17.796
<i>Crisis, survival,</i>

47:19.047 --> 47:21.340
<i>advancement.</i>

47:21.341 --> 47:24.886
<i>Our founder, Mother Raquella,
was poisoned.</i>

47:25.929 --> 47:30.057
<i>To survive, she harnessed
her body's own chemistry,</i>

47:30.058 --> 47:33.144
<i>transmuting the toxins
on a cellular level.</i>

47:34.979 --> 47:39.150
<i>In doing so,
she awakened something deeper.</i>

47:40.735 --> 47:44.780
<i>The voices of her mother,
her mother's mother, back and back,</i>

47:44.781 --> 47:47.282
<i>until all of the women
who had come before her</i>

47:47.283 --> 47:49.828
<i>opened their minds to her and spoke.</i>

47:51.079 --> 47:55.709
Lila Cho Grace Na-Berto Anirul...

48:00.171 --> 48:02.799
it is time to awaken those who made you.

48:03.758 --> 48:07.178
It is an Agony, but only this once.

48:08.304 --> 48:10.306
When you find yourself in the darkness,

48:11.307 --> 48:12.684
seek the light.

48:13.518 --> 48:17.147
Your foremothers will waken wild, hungry.

48:19.899 --> 48:21.901
Do not let them sway you.

48:24.029 --> 48:27.240
All that matters is the light.

48:38.335 --> 48:40.795
It will lead you back to life.

48:43.423 --> 48:45.050
Back to us.

48:47.635 --> 48:49.846
And you will emerge

48:50.388 --> 48:52.098
a Reverend Mother.

49:12.369 --> 49:16.373
For this poison, there is no antidote.

49:18.291 --> 49:21.251
Still your breath, focus your mind,

49:21.252 --> 49:24.214
and unlock your other memory.

49:28.343 --> 49:30.136
Just follow my voice.

49:31.262 --> 49:34.683
Let it guide you, and breathe.

49:59.916 --> 50:01.084
<i>Breathe in.</i>

50:03.503 --> 50:04.504
Breathe in!

50:06.589 --> 50:09.300
Break down the poison,
so there is nothing but molecules.

50:22.605 --> 50:23.606
That's it, Sister.

50:26.609 --> 50:27.777
Breathe out.

50:31.322 --> 50:33.033
Release the energy.

50:33.575 --> 50:35.160
<i>Let it fuel you.</i>

52:43.371 --> 52:44.789
Raquella.

52:50.086 --> 52:51.962
The key to the reckoning...

52:51.963 --> 52:54.923
...is one born twice. Once...

52:54.924 --> 52:56.342
...in blood...

52:56.343 --> 52:58.553
...once in spice.

52:59.346 --> 53:00.930
One born twice. Who is that?

53:01.264 --> 53:04.434
A revenant full of scars.

53:04.768 --> 53:07.227
A weapon born of war...

53:07.228 --> 53:09.647
...on a path too short.

53:10.106 --> 53:11.690
What is the nature of their power?

53:11.691 --> 53:13.068
How do we fight it?

53:23.787 --> 53:24.954
What's happening?

53:26.247 --> 53:27.123
Raquella!

53:28.458 --> 53:29.668
Raquella!

53:30.627 --> 53:35.214
We walk together, hand-in-hand,
with only one light to guide us.

53:35.215 --> 53:37.925
Our steps are short. We do not falter.

53:37.926 --> 53:40.762
We know we will be born into the infinite.

53:43.765 --> 53:45.058
Raquella!

53:50.522 --> 53:52.273
My little lamb.

53:53.316 --> 53:55.402
My little lamb.

53:57.237 --> 53:58.446
Mother.

53:59.739 --> 54:01.366
Is that you?

54:03.034 --> 54:05.036
Is that what they told you?

54:05.704 --> 54:07.539
To get you to come?

54:08.456 --> 54:10.749
I'm sorry, granddaughter.

54:10.750 --> 54:12.002
She is not here.

54:15.922 --> 54:18.341
But I've been waiting for you.

54:19.009 --> 54:22.512
<i>Stop!</i>

54:35.734 --> 54:37.193
Harkonnen,

54:39.279 --> 54:42.115
you stole my future.

54:43.324 --> 54:45.618
Now I'm taking your hope.

54:50.331 --> 54:52.625
Lila, get out of there!

54:53.043 --> 54:54.085
Follow my voice!

54:55.253 --> 54:56.338
<i>The light!</i>

55:09.267 --> 55:10.810
<i>You've got to get out of there!</i>

55:29.788 --> 55:30.788
Lila.

55:30.789 --> 55:32.248
Lila, no!

55:39.255 --> 55:43.259
No, Lila, come back. Please, Lila.

55:47.097 --> 55:48.973
<i>I know how it feels to lose a child.</i>

55:49.599 --> 55:51.601
There is no worse pain.

55:53.228 --> 55:55.522
But to levy threats against my family,

55:56.147 --> 56:00.527
to rescind the deal we made for the fleet,
that cannot be ignored.

56:05.115 --> 56:06.700
You weak fool.

56:07.200 --> 56:09.702
You think you can silence me?

56:09.703 --> 56:14.833
I will tear you from that throne
and feed you to the wolves

56:15.375 --> 56:17.585
and let them choke on you!

56:22.507 --> 56:23.967
Who the hell are you?

56:34.644 --> 56:36.521
It's you, you're the--

56:45.530 --> 56:46.822
- What is he doing?
- What?

56:46.823 --> 56:49.034
Please, make it stop!

56:59.294 --> 57:02.297
Please, mercy! Mercy.

57:03.214 --> 57:05.175
Mercy!

57:26.404 --> 57:30.241
Return home, bury your son.

57:33.286 --> 57:36.081
Say nothing of what transpired here.
We'll let these

57:37.290 --> 57:39.918
tragic circumstances fade from history.

58:39.644 --> 58:41.271
Mother Superior.

58:43.690 --> 58:47.193
It would appear the sands
have shifted in my absence.

58:48.236 --> 58:52.114
Well, I am a hard man
to keep chained.

58:52.115 --> 58:54.366
I need to speak with Emperor Corrino.

58:54.367 --> 58:56.786
I have word on the rebel threat.

58:57.954 --> 59:01.499
Unfortunately, House Corrino
no longer requires your services.

59:02.625 --> 59:06.796
Your privileges at the palace have
been revoked.

59:10.008 --> 59:11.634
That's your game.

59:13.595 --> 59:15.597
You think you can replace me?

59:26.733 --> 59:29.152
- What do you want?
- I told you what I want.

59:29.611 --> 59:32.030
I want what's best for the Imperium.

59:32.864 --> 59:37.535
And that is to wipe out every trace of you
and your Sisters from our worlds.

59:38.286 --> 59:40.705
I run a school for young women.

59:41.331 --> 59:44.124
- We're not a threat to anyone.
- We both know that is not true.

59:44.125 --> 59:46.836
You mistake me for someone afraid.

59:48.505 --> 59:50.798
I'm not a nine-year-old boy.

59:50.799 --> 59:52.467
And neither was Kasha Jinjo.

59:52.801 --> 59:55.512
<i>Stop! Take out your blade!</i>

01:00:05.105 --> 01:00:06.773
<i>Hold it to your neck!</i>

01:00:14.072 --> 01:00:16.908
<i>Now drive it into your throat.</i>

01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:30.839
<i>Drive it into your throat!</i>

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:58.283
I always wondered what
your greatest fear would be.

01:01:01.077 --> 01:01:02.495
Now I have seen it.

01:01:03.204 --> 01:01:05.165
It's not that no one will hear you.

01:01:05.915 --> 01:01:07.917
It's that they'll hear you

01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:10.712
and just won't care.
