It's been some time, hasn't it?

00:44.250 --> 00:46.457
I was wondering
if we could have a little chat?

00:46.458 --> 00:48.874
So if you step out of line,
I will be there.

However, Vanessa's resistance

- is that he do nothing.
- [honking increases]

12:42.625 --> 12:43.791
What's going on here?

12:43.792 --> 12:45.082
It's a big hole.

12:45.083 --> 12:46.707
We'll be around it in, like, a minute.

12:46.708 --> 12:48.667
[honking continues]

12:50.958 --> 12:52.332
[man] Hey. Hey, what're you doing?

12:52.333 --> 12:53.500
[seat belt clicks]

12:54.583 --> 12:57.666
Oh... Sir, I'd advise against
whatever you--

12:57.667 --> 12:59.666
- Shit. Why didn't you stop him?
- [honking continues]

12:59.667 --> 13:02.042
That's your job, not mine.

13:04.167 --> 13:06.332
[Fisk] Foreman. Who's the foreman?

13:06.333 --> 13:09.583
[foreman] Yeah. What's up?
Hey, you're the mayor.

13:10.208 --> 13:11.499
- [Fisk] Yes.
- How you doing?

13:11.500 --> 13:14.166
I want you to stop what you're doing
and fill that hole.

13:14.167 --> 13:16.624
You have the equipment
and the manpower.

13:16.625 --> 13:18.457
[foreman] Hey, sorry, sir.
It's the red tape.

13:18.458 --> 13:20.374
We're waitin' on the permit approval.

13:20.375 --> 13:21.957
[Fisk] Consider it approved.

13:21.958 --> 13:24.416
You got it. Fellas, hole!

13:24.417 --> 13:26.999
Let's go. Now! Move!

13:27.000 --> 13:28.582
- [worker 1] Coming.
- [foreman] Mikey,

13:28.583 --> 13:30.082
hey, we're back in business.

13:30.083 --> 13:31.749
- Let's go.
- [Mikey] Yes, sir.

13:31.750 --> 13:32.957
[workers shouting indistinctly]

13:32.958 --> 13:35.042
[worker 2] There's too much traffic.
All right?

13:35.542 --> 13:37.999
- [worker 2] Hurry up.
- Yes. Filling a hole like this,

13:38.000 --> 13:39.791
it's not rocket science.

13:39.792 --> 13:42.249
Remember I told you
that I'd get things done?

13:42.250 --> 13:44.291
Well, here I am getting them done.

13:44.292 --> 13:46.250
- [man] Fuck yeah!
- [crowd cheering]

13:47.375 --> 13:48.374
[man 2] I love you, man.

13:48.375 --> 13:49.749
[cheering continues]

13:49.750 --> 13:52.000
[Fisk] I assume
that is what you meant by optics.

13:52.792 --> 13:55.582
Yes, Mayor Fisk. It was indeed.

13:55.583 --> 13:56.791
- [Daniel] Sir?
- [Fisk] Yeah.

13:56.792 --> 13:59.541
Solid hole work, you know,
filling in that hole.

13:59.542 --> 14:00.750
Oh, thank you, Daniel.

14:01.875 --> 14:04.416
[♪ intriguing music playing]

14:04.417 --> 14:07.666
[Kirsten] I send you off for a DUl,
and you come back with a cop killing?

14:07.667 --> 14:09.666
With everything that this firm
has going on right now?

14:09.667 --> 14:11.457
The cops at the station
were beating him senseless.

14:11.458 --> 14:12.541
What did you want me to do?

14:12.542 --> 14:14.125
He probably wouldn't have made it
past the weekend.

14:15.917 --> 14:17.582
And, for what it's worth,
I think he might be innocent.

14:17.583 --> 14:19.416
[Kirsten] You can barely handle
your current caseload.

14:19.417 --> 14:21.249
- I'd have to sit second chair.
- A high-profile case like this

14:21.250 --> 14:23.166
- is not the worst thing in the world.
- It's exactly the opposite

14:23.167 --> 14:24.374
of what this firm needs right now.

14:24.375 --> 14:27.957
Okay, so my old partner at Midtown
slipped me the police report.

14:27.958 --> 14:31.457
The other cop said there was no victim.
He said that it was an unprovoked attack.

14:31.458 --> 14:33.541
Uh-- well, our client says there was.

14:33.542 --> 14:35.292
"He said, he said."

14:35.958 --> 14:37.374
Matt, you take on this case,

14:37.375 --> 14:39.832
it's gonna look like
you're siding against the whole NYPD.

14:39.833 --> 14:42.958
Kirsten, what did I tell you to get you
to come over from the DA's office?

14:44.167 --> 14:46.166
You said that I was brilliant,
which is true.

14:46.167 --> 14:48.708
[chuckles] That is true. What else?

14:50.667 --> 14:52.207
You said we'd take on the hard cases.

14:52.208 --> 14:54.667
[Matt] And impossible odds work
is what we do here.

14:59.750 --> 15:01.417
[sighs]

15:04.667 --> 15:05.667
Okay.

15:06.167 --> 15:07.166
Thank you.

15:07.167 --> 15:09.749
I just need Arnie to take over for me
on the Rogers depo.

15:09.750 --> 15:11.208
Great. I appreciate it.

15:11.958 --> 15:12.957

15:12.958 --> 15:15.624
Talk to Hector's wife,
and I need you to find the witness

15:15.625 --> 15:17.250
that Hector saved on the platform.

15:21.125 --> 15:22.375
I believe him, Cherry.

15:24.292 --> 15:25.708
[smacks lips] Okay.

15:26.708 --> 15:28.374
So you want me to find the guy
on the platform?

15:28.375 --> 15:29.499
Yes.

15:29.500 --> 15:31.042
How much you want me to push?

15:31.625 --> 15:33.125
As much as you have to...

15:34.458 --> 15:36.125
and do some digging on Hector for me.

15:36.917 --> 15:39.291
There's something about his story
that doesn't track.

15:39.292 --> 15:42.291
Wait. He's innocent
or his story doesn't track?

15:42.292 --> 15:43.791
Uh... [laughs]

Both.

Mr. Murdock. Over here.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.957
Why are you representing a cop killer,
Mr. Murdock?

15:50.958 --> 15:52.666
- Are you anti-cop?
- My client is innocent,

15:52.667 --> 15:54.666
and we look forward to his day in court.
Thank you very much.

15:54.667 --> 15:56.499
What does the Ayala family say about this?

15:56.500 --> 15:57.791
- Thank you.
- That's all for now.

15:57.792 --> 15:59.791
[reporter 2] Are you worried
about the reputation of your firm?

15:59.792 --> 16:02.457

that Mayor Fisk will watch this closely?

- All right. Hang in there.

[Hochberg] Benjamin Hochberg, Your Honor,
representing the People

17:13.042 --> 17:15.749
- of the State of New York.
- Matt Murdock for the defense, Your Honor.

17:15.750 --> 17:19.124
- We'll waive the readings, not the rights.
- Given the serious nature of the charges,

17:19.125 --> 17:22.082
People ask that the defendant
be remanded without bail.

17:22.083 --> 17:25.042
- Your Honor, the defense would ask--
- The People's motion is granted.

17:25.833 --> 17:28.957
- Uh... Your Honor, if I could--
- I said bail is denied.

17:28.958 --> 17:30.124

Mr. Ayala is a decorated Army veteran.
He has no record.

He served as a CPA for 15 years.
He's a pillar of his community.

17:35.500 --> 17:38.541
He's also accused of killing
a New York City police officer.

Every time...

19:41.333 --> 19:42.333

I mean, Gallo is a celebrated
police commissioner.

20:00.042 --> 20:02.583
Maybe the most beloved
this city has ever seen.

That NYPD's rank and file are planning
on standing behind their guy

20:09.375 --> 20:11.207

20:11.208 --> 20:13.916

is already woefully understaffed,

son of a bitch in a cemetery?

24:17.833 --> 24:20.750
How are we gonna fix this issue?

24:21.833 --> 24:23.792
Do you...
Do you know who Samuel Vance was?

24:24.500 --> 24:25.624
No, of course you don't.

24:25.625 --> 24:30.333
Mayor Vance was the mayor of New York
in 1874. He served for one month.

24:31.208 --> 24:35.250
It is my personal mission to make sure
that your term is shorter than his.

[♪ unsettling music playing]

24:37.792 --> 24:39.624
I see right through you, Fisk.

24:39.625 --> 24:44.042
You... You're not a mayor
who loves his city. You're a whiny kid

24:44.917 --> 24:46.708
who wants everyone to love him,

24:47.500 --> 24:49.792
a monster trying to rewrite his legacy.

24:51.042 --> 24:52.083
Well, guess what?

24:53.750 --> 24:54.750
It's too late.

24:55.458 --> 24:57.292
Once a thug, always a thug.

25:00.042 --> 25:01.667

25:15.375 --> 25:19.375
[Kirsten] Your husband needs you, Soledad.
It's important that you're seen in court.

25:20.333 --> 25:21.666
Can I ask you both something?

25:21.667 --> 25:25.082
We've read the papers,
seen the news and all that.

25:25.083 --> 25:26.250
Can you just be straight?

25:26.875 --> 25:28.417
Does my husband have a chance?

25:29.208 --> 25:31.041
[Cherry] An NYPD cop is dead.

25:31.042 --> 25:33.832
And anytime that happens,
a big machine gets turned on

25:33.833 --> 25:37.375
to try to figure out what went wrong.
And to punish whoever killed the cop.

25:38.333 --> 25:41.625
Punish them severely.
And that machine has no off switch.

25:42.458 --> 25:44.542
It just goes and goes until somebody pays.

25:45.125 --> 25:48.416
But Matt Murdock and this woman here

25:48.417 --> 25:51.374
are the two best lawyers
I've ever seen, so.

25:51.375 --> 25:53.875
Now, if I could just get
Hector's suit for court?

25:55.583 --> 25:57.457
Okay, it's on the bed.
I can get it together.

25:57.458 --> 25:59.083
No, no, no, no. You two stay and talk.

26:05.583 --> 26:08.625
Soledad, whatever is going on
between you and Hector,

26:09.375 --> 26:12.582
I'm really hoping you can set it aside.
He needs you.

26:12.583 --> 26:14.708
He needs me,
or he needs me to show up in court?

26:16.500 --> 26:18.708
[Kirsten] Trials are about feelings
as much as facts.

26:20.000 --> 26:23.499
The jury is gonna feel a certain way
if you're there by his side

26:23.500 --> 26:25.582
and another if you're absent.

26:25.583 --> 26:27.374
[♪ slow suspenseful music playing]

26:27.375 --> 26:28.542

Are you married?

26:34.167 --> 26:35.167
No, I'm not.

26:36.208 --> 26:37.875
[Soledad] When you first come together,

26:38.500 --> 26:42.625
everything feels wide open.
Anything's possible.

26:43.250 --> 26:47.124
- Little by little, that fades.
- [bottle cap squeaks, clatters]

26:47.125 --> 26:48.542
Things changed.

26:49.125 --> 26:51.542
Hector... he's not the man I married.

26:52.542 --> 26:54.499
[♪ tense music playing]

26:54.500 --> 26:56.916
[Kirsten] This all boils down
to one question.

26:56.917 --> 26:59.458
Do you want this man
spending his life in prison?

27:01.250 --> 27:02.624
[Matt] You're taking me to Eastern Europe?

27:02.625 --> 27:04.374
- [Heather] Yes.
- [Matt] It's fine with me.

27:04.375 --> 27:05.499
How about...

27:07.917 --> 27:10.958
Belize? Belize I like.

of the Caribbean Basin.

27:15.083 --> 27:17.124

- [Matt chuckles]

27:22.292 --> 27:26.708
Yeah, that sounds good.
Okay, so this fantasy of ours...

27:28.208 --> 27:30.207
What happens after the mai tais?

27:30.208 --> 27:33.249
Oh, um, the possibilities are endless.

27:33.250 --> 27:35.041
- [Matt] Oh, yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

27:35.042 --> 27:38.499
Maybe, uh, later, I can give you a taste.

- Take it.
- Yeah. It'll be two seconds.

You'll make it up to me later.

28:11.708 --> 28:13.166
You were investigating me?

28:13.167 --> 28:15.166
We talked for hours
and you neglect to tell me

28:15.167 --> 28:16.624
that you moonlight as a vigilante?

28:16.625 --> 28:19.791
I wasn't in the suit or wearing my amulet.

28:19.792 --> 28:21.916
I had no extra powers. It's not relevant.

28:21.917 --> 28:23.292
It's relevant.

28:24.458 --> 28:27.624
You hide your identity and go out
and solve things the way you see fit.

28:27.625 --> 28:29.582
We're trying to position this
as a one-off event.

28:29.583 --> 28:31.416
I find out you're going out at night
looking for trouble.

28:31.417 --> 28:32.917
I'm not looking for trouble.

28:34.750 --> 28:36.292
Someone's gotta protect the streets.

28:37.000 --> 28:39.000

No one seems to care.

you better believe the DA's office can.

Let them. The people need a hero.

28:53.250 --> 28:56.291
I'm out there every night,
putting my life on the line for them.

28:56.292 --> 28:58.250
Your wife agree with that choice?

29:01.042 --> 29:02.542
This is a tough case, Hector.

29:03.292 --> 29:04.542
A cop is dead.

29:05.083 --> 29:07.917
And the only way I can win it
is if I know every way I can lose it.

29:11.042 --> 29:12.042
You're right.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.874
You're right. I'm sorry.
I should have told you.

Hmm. [sighs wearily]

All right, hang in there, okay?
I'll make some calls, see what I can do.

29:36.375 --> 29:37.667
[Buck] He's been waiting 20 minutes.

29:38.792 --> 29:40.583
Yes. Yeah. Send him in.

29:43.833 --> 29:45.166
[Gallo] Well, you seem pretty busy,

29:45.167 --> 29:47.042
so I'll get right to the point.

29:47.625 --> 29:51.874
I'm resigning my post,
effective tonight at midnight.

29:51.875 --> 29:53.707
And due to unforeseen
scheduling conflicts,

29:53.708 --> 29:57.000
I will not be able to stay on
to help with the transition.

29:57.458 --> 29:59.749
But you will need a new
Police Commissioner,

29:59.750 --> 30:03.375
and-- [chuckles] And guess what?
A lot of new cops as well.

30:05.250 --> 30:06.250
Goodbye, Fisk.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.708
[Fisk] Before you go, just one thing.

30:13.500 --> 30:16.750
You're originally from Philadelphia.

30:17.208 --> 30:18.958
- That's right.
- And you know that,

30:19.792 --> 30:22.291
the cheesesteaks are great in Philly.

30:22.292 --> 30:25.041
Mr. Cashman, what's the name
of the one that we like?

30:25.042 --> 30:26.374
Geno's, Mr. Mayor.

30:26.375 --> 30:29.082
Geno's, right, right.
But that's your favorite.

30:29.083 --> 30:30.417
I... I...

30:31.208 --> 30:35.875
I think that the best is one that I found.
It's actually right outside of the city.

30:38.667 --> 30:40.707
D'Angelo's in King of Prussia.

30:40.708 --> 30:41.791
[♪ menacing music playing]

30:41.792 --> 30:46.167
Mr. Cashman was kind enough to drive down
there and pick me one up for lunch.

30:46.667 --> 30:48.583
It was delicious.

30:50.958 --> 30:53.250
The concept of compromise...

30:54.542 --> 30:56.750
it's been on my mind a lot.

30:58.250 --> 31:02.333
So I have some compromises to propose.

31:05.292 --> 31:09.875
As far as a pay raise
for your police force,

31:11.083 --> 31:12.083
zero.

31:13.750 --> 31:18.250
And when it comes to overtime minimums...

31:21.417 --> 31:22.417
None.

31:24.042 --> 31:26.041
And... and...

31:26.042 --> 31:29.167
- An expanded cadet class.
- Yes, yes.

31:29.917 --> 31:31.250
That's not happening.

31:32.167 --> 31:35.125
So what do you say, Commissioner?
Do we have a deal?

31:40.167 --> 31:42.667
Fine. No, I'll stay.

31:45.083 --> 31:46.958
Be careful what you wish for.

31:50.542 --> 31:52.750
- [door opens]
- Well played.

31:54.125 --> 31:55.125
No.

31:56.792 --> 31:58.583
For the most part, men are weak.

32:00.042 --> 32:04.625
Any man can be swayed
by a single piece of paper.

32:06.042 --> 32:08.625
He thought he could keep
that child a secret.

32:10.833 --> 32:12.958
Sandwich was disgusting.

32:14.000 --> 32:16.582
Hector's history as the White Tiger
has no bearing on this case.

32:16.583 --> 32:18.082
The defense moves to suppress.

32:18.083 --> 32:20.874
[scoffs] This is next level, Murdock.
That guy's a vigilante.

32:20.875 --> 32:22.582
Who wasn't in possession
of his mystical amulet.

32:22.583 --> 32:24.749
Or in the White Tiger outfit
at the time of the incident.

32:24.750 --> 32:28.874
Allowing this type of totally inflammatory
information will unfairly bias the jurors.

32:28.875 --> 32:31.957
It perfectly meets the standard
of more prejudicial than probative.

32:31.958 --> 32:34.707
Cut the crap. It speaks straight
to the heart of the case.

32:34.708 --> 32:36.707
It suggests a pattern of behavior

32:36.708 --> 32:38.541
- that drove Hector Ayala...

to allow everything
but the kitchen sink in as evidence.

it's not what you're up there to do.

All the more reason it's dangerous.

It's not hypothetical, Cherry, is it?

- Is it?

34:48.167 --> 34:50.374
You know I know he was telling the truth.

if you can't prove it.

Dr. Glenn, allow me to introduce
Mayor and Mrs. Fisk.

38:16.083 --> 38:19.000
[Heather] So I usually like to start off
with a couple of questions.

38:20.208 --> 38:23.875
What sparked you to come to therapy,
and what would you like to get out of it?

38:26.750 --> 38:29.208
Vanessa, why don't you start us off?

38:32.042 --> 38:36.542
My husband and I have been through
a lot these last couple of years.

38:39.333 --> 38:40.707
[chuckles dryly]

38:40.708 --> 38:43.875
Until very recently,
we ran a complex business.

38:44.625 --> 38:46.875
Then Wilson left.

38:49.042 --> 38:50.583
Disappeared, really. [chuckles]

38:52.542 --> 38:54.792
[Heather] I'm curious to hear
more about that.

38:56.042 --> 38:57.042
Wilson?

39:00.125 --> 39:02.208
I was assaulted by a vigilante.

39:04.625 --> 39:08.208
The... recovery process,
it was quite involved.

39:12.042 --> 39:14.124
I couldn't stay in touch with Vanessa.

39:14.125 --> 39:16.333
I couldn't stay in communication with her.

39:16.875 --> 39:18.000
It was for the best.

39:19.250 --> 39:21.208
Was it for the best for you, Vanessa?

39:22.542 --> 39:24.500
- I think in some ways, it was--
- In some ways--

39:30.125 --> 39:31.750
I... I took over the business.

39:32.750 --> 39:33.750
It thrived.

39:35.167 --> 39:37.542
It had never been more profitable.

39:38.375 --> 39:42.167
And relationship between
management and labor was...

39:43.667 --> 39:45.708

39:46.625 --> 39:47.708
For both sides.
