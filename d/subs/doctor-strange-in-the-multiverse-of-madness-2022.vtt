WEBVTT

01:03.480 --> 01:04.564
-Did that kill it?
-No.

01:04.647 --> 01:05.857
That's how we kill it.

01:10.653 --> 01:12.155
The Book of Vishanti!

01:15.867 --> 01:17.118
We can't let it take your power.

01:17.202 --> 01:18.203
Get to the book.

01:18.286 --> 01:20.371
-How do we get across?
-Jump.

01:23.333 --> 01:24.709
-Hold on!

01:26.920 --> 01:29.047
- No, no, no!

02:08.962 --> 02:10.547
It's too strong.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.257
I can't hold it.

02:38.449 --> 02:39.450
I'm so sorry.

02:40.076 --> 02:41.286
This is the only way.

02:44.497 --> 02:45.498
What're you doing?

02:45.582 --> 02:47.542
I can't let that thing take your power.

02:48.209 --> 02:49.586
You can't control it.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.130
But I can.

02:52.839 --> 02:53.965
But we're friends.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.509
You're killing me.

02:56.593 --> 02:57.677
I know.

02:58.761 --> 03:01.723
But in the grand calculus
of the Multiverse,

03:01.890 --> 03:03.850
your sacrifice
is worth more than your...

04:28.393 --> 04:30.186
Excuse me. May I?

04:30.353 --> 04:31.354
Thanks.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.001
Doctor Strange.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.252
Doctor West.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.213
Haven't seen you in a while.

04:57.380 --> 05:01.426
Yeah, I was a little preoccupied
being dust there for five years, so...

05:01.592 --> 05:03.094
So were a lot of us.

05:05.930 --> 05:07.515
While I was gone,

05:08.308 --> 05:09.851
thank you for asking,

05:10.893 --> 05:12.687
I lost both my cats...

05:15.940 --> 05:17.233
and my brother.

05:20.486 --> 05:21.946
I'm very sorry.

05:23.239 --> 05:24.240
Thank you.

05:26.868 --> 05:27.869
I, uh...

05:29.912 --> 05:32.915
I guess what keeps me up
at night is wondering,

05:33.708 --> 05:35.668
did it have to happen that way?

05:37.837 --> 05:39.756
Was there any other path?

05:43.384 --> 05:44.635
No.

05:46.929 --> 05:48.681
No, I made the only play we had.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.808
Well, of course you did.

05:51.517 --> 05:54.562
The best surgeon and the best superhero.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.651
But you still didn't get the girl.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.160
Glass of red, please.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.246
-Oh, allow me, miss.
-- Mm.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.332
-Ah.
-Little too on the nose?

06:56.499 --> 06:58.167
What? For you, at my wedding?

06:58.334 --> 07:00.420
-Nah. I think it was perfect.

07:00.711 --> 07:01.838
Congratulations.

07:02.004 --> 07:03.172
Thank you.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.133
Mm. There's Charlie.

07:05.299 --> 07:07.510
I have to introduce you
because he's kind of...

07:07.677 --> 07:10.763
It's embarrassing,
but he's a big fan, so...

07:10.972 --> 07:12.390
Hey, uh, Christine. Um...

07:14.016 --> 07:15.017
I should've...

07:17.895 --> 07:19.063
I wish I'd have been different.

07:19.856 --> 07:22.150
I never stopped caring about us.

07:22.316 --> 07:24.402
But I had to make sacrifices

07:25.194 --> 07:26.696
to protect you.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.406
I'm sorry.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.912
It was never gonna work out
between us.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.583
Why not?

07:38.666 --> 07:40.585
Because, Stephen,

07:40.751 --> 07:43.045
you have to be the one
holding the knife.

07:43.796 --> 07:45.298
And I always respected you for it,

07:45.381 --> 07:47.175
but I couldn't love you for it.

07:52.221 --> 07:53.806
How long you had that one
in the barrel?

07:56.267 --> 07:57.310
Long time.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.312
Yeah. I bet.

07:59.479 --> 08:00.480
Look, um...

08:02.148 --> 08:04.692
Truly, I'm just glad that you're happy.

08:04.901 --> 08:05.902
- Mm.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.029
I am.

08:09.155 --> 08:10.281
I really, really am.

08:10.823 --> 08:11.824
Good.

08:12.909 --> 08:13.910
Are you?

08:14.494 --> 08:15.870
I'm happy.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.455
Good.

08:17.914 --> 08:19.248
You deserve it.

08:28.925 --> 08:30.885
- Oh, man.
Look out! What is that?

08:32.595 --> 08:33.888
Dude!

08:41.562 --> 08:42.563
- Thank you.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.480
-Wow!

09:29.318 --> 09:31.320
No, no.

09:44.750 --> 09:46.252
-Look out!

09:57.305 --> 09:58.306
Do I know you?

11:40.950 --> 11:42.451
- Help!

11:49.166 --> 11:50.167
You're welcome.

11:50.876 --> 11:52.044
You know it's ancient custom

11:52.128 --> 11:54.213
to bow in the presence
of the Sorcerer Supreme?

11:54.296 --> 11:56.382
Yeah, I'm aware of the customs.

12:02.555 --> 12:04.807
Hold it, hold it! Whoa!

12:28.622 --> 12:29.749
Whoa.

12:30.207 --> 12:31.375
That's incredible.

12:31.751 --> 12:32.793
- Yeah.

12:37.923 --> 12:39.133
Oh, God!

13:34.814 --> 13:35.815
Who's this?

13:35.898 --> 13:37.149
Yeah, I was gonna ask the same question.

13:37.233 --> 13:38.567
Hey, kid.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.152
What did that creature want with you?

13:40.236 --> 13:41.320
Where're your parents?

13:41.403 --> 13:42.571
We'll take her back to the Sanc...

13:46.033 --> 13:47.117
She took my Slingie.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.869
She took your Slingie.

13:53.374 --> 13:55.626
- Yeah, it was crazy, man.

13:55.709 --> 13:56.877
Oh, my God!

13:58.504 --> 14:00.256
I'm not gonna kill you, kid.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.925
I just bust my ass
trying to save your life, remember?

14:05.511 --> 14:07.346
Giant monsters I can clearly handle,

14:07.429 --> 14:10.683
but what bothers me is that last night,
you were in my dream.

14:12.142 --> 14:14.395
That wasn't a dream.

14:14.895 --> 14:16.438
It was another universe.

14:19.441 --> 14:21.735
How much experience do you guys have
with the Multiverse?

14:22.403 --> 14:23.863
We have experience of the Multiverse.

14:23.946 --> 14:26.031
Most recently, there was
an incident with Spider-Man.

14:26.115 --> 14:27.408
What man?

14:27.491 --> 14:29.702
Spider-Man.
He has the powers of a spider.

14:29.785 --> 14:31.829
-Hence the name.
-Gross.

14:31.912 --> 14:34.081
-Does he look like a spider?
-No. No, more like a man.

14:34.164 --> 14:35.291
Climbs walls, shoots webs.

14:35.374 --> 14:36.834
-- Yeah. Bingo.
-Out of his butt?

14:36.917 --> 14:38.168
-No.

14:38.335 --> 14:39.670
Well, maybe, I don't know.

14:39.753 --> 14:40.880
Honestly, I hope not.

14:40.963 --> 14:42.047
- Super weird.

14:43.799 --> 14:45.134
You're gonna get a stomach ache.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.844
I'm from another universe.

14:46.927 --> 14:48.679
How do you know my stomach
works the same as yours?

14:48.762 --> 14:49.972
I don't.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.474
I don't even know
if you're from another universe,

14:52.558 --> 14:54.518
which is why I'm still sitting here,
waiting for you

14:54.602 --> 14:55.769
-to enlighten us.

14:55.853 --> 14:56.854
Gotta say,

14:57.438 --> 14:59.064
of the two Doctor Stranges
I've met so far...

14:59.690 --> 15:00.691
...you're not my favorite.

15:00.774 --> 15:02.318
-Which means?

15:03.611 --> 15:04.987
Does he not know Spanish?

15:05.404 --> 15:07.865
I'm not sure
he even enjoys speaking English.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.576
Look,
I left a very nice wedding

15:10.659 --> 15:13.495
to save a smart-ass kid
from getting eaten by an octopus.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.580
-Whose wedding?
-Now tell me...

15:14.663 --> 15:15.706
-Christine's.
-You went?

15:15.789 --> 15:16.874
Holy shit, you married Christine?

15:16.957 --> 15:17.958
-Do you mind?
-Yes, I do.

15:18.042 --> 15:19.209
No, I didn't. Yes.

15:19.293 --> 15:21.462
You need to explain to me
what's going on.

15:21.545 --> 15:23.714
Why was that octopus trying to eat you?

15:23.797 --> 15:25.674
That thing was trying to kidnap me.

15:26.675 --> 15:29.094
It's like a henchman
who works for a demon.

15:29.178 --> 15:32.056
All we knew is that they wanted
to take my power for themselves.

15:32.139 --> 15:33.307
What power?

15:34.892 --> 15:36.352
I can travel the Multiverse.

15:36.936 --> 15:37.937
What?

15:38.020 --> 15:40.314
You can physically move
from one universe to another?

15:40.397 --> 15:41.565
-- Mm-hmm.
-How?

15:41.649 --> 15:43.609
That's the problem.
I don't know how.

15:43.776 --> 15:45.027
Can't control it.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.196
Only happens when
I'm really, really afraid.

15:47.905 --> 15:51.492
Okay. And did Other Me know
how to defeat this demon?

15:51.659 --> 15:52.826
- Well, you guys knew

15:52.910 --> 15:54.662
of this magical book of pure good

15:54.828 --> 15:57.873
that gives a sorcerer whatever they need
to defeat their enemy.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.084
The Book of Vishanti?

16:00.542 --> 16:01.669
It's not real.

16:01.835 --> 16:04.129
It's a fairy tale.
It doesn't exist.

16:04.213 --> 16:05.297
Actually, it does.

16:06.340 --> 16:08.926
I found out in the secret book you get
when you become Sorcerer Supreme.

16:09.009 --> 16:10.219
- Unbelievable.

16:10.302 --> 16:11.637
You're not the Sorcerer Supreme?

16:11.720 --> 16:13.472
No, I'm not the Sorcerer Supreme.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.224
Other You was Sorcerer Supreme
of his universe.

16:15.307 --> 16:16.350
- Right. Yeah.

16:16.433 --> 16:18.060
Although it does exist,

16:18.227 --> 16:20.479
the Book of Vishanti
is said to be unreachable.

16:21.563 --> 16:22.898
It is. Except...

16:24.066 --> 16:25.067
we reached it.

16:26.944 --> 16:28.821
Then the demon caught up with us.

16:29.029 --> 16:31.657
I thought you'd protect me...

16:34.576 --> 16:35.577
but you didn't.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.162
That was the fight in my dream.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.082
That wasn't a dream.

16:41.125 --> 16:42.126
Prove it.

16:50.551 --> 16:51.927
It wasn't a dream.

16:59.184 --> 17:00.436
That means...

17:02.229 --> 17:05.024
dreams are windows into the lives
of our Multiversal selves.

17:07.443 --> 17:08.902
That was his theory.

17:09.069 --> 17:11.947
So, that recurring nightmare
where I'm running naked from a clown...

17:12.698 --> 17:14.575
Somewhere out there, it's real.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.494
Somewhere out there I had a ponytail.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.123
- There could be
more creatures coming for her.

17:21.206 --> 17:23.500
The power is dangerous enough
in the hands of a kid.

17:23.584 --> 17:24.960
Imagine if a real threat acquired it?

17:27.588 --> 17:30.049
It occurs to me, young one,
we don't know your name.

17:33.635 --> 17:34.762
America Chavez.

17:34.845 --> 17:38.057
Miss Chavez, will you come
with us to Kamar-Taj?

17:38.223 --> 17:39.433
You'll be safe there.

17:40.225 --> 17:42.311
How do I know you won't
betray me like he did?

17:43.437 --> 17:45.439
I guess you're just
gonna have to trust me.

17:49.151 --> 17:50.736
- What do we do with him?

17:59.495 --> 18:00.954
That's gotta violate an ordinance.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.581
Ah, I've buried worse.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.044
The creature that killed him, did...

18:07.795 --> 18:09.797
did it have the same markings
as the octopus?

18:09.963 --> 18:11.006
Runes.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.300
This isn't sorcery.

18:14.635 --> 18:15.636
It's witchcraft.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.639
Do we know anyone
who's faced such a thing?

18:21.850 --> 18:22.976
I think I might.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.065
-Chocolate!
-Hey! What did I say?

18:28.148 --> 18:29.274
But we couldn't wait.

18:29.358 --> 18:30.609
But what did I say?

18:31.985 --> 18:33.320
Oh!

18:34.238 --> 18:36.115
Go wash your hands.

18:40.869 --> 18:42.913
Mom, come on.
We're too old for that.

18:43.080 --> 18:45.249
Oh, okay.

18:45.415 --> 18:46.500
You can tuck me in, Mom.

18:47.292 --> 18:48.335
I will.

18:51.672 --> 18:55.384
You know, a family is forever.

18:56.260 --> 18:59.346
We could never truly leave each other,
even if we tried.

18:59.513 --> 19:01.431
Mom, I changed my mind.

19:01.598 --> 19:03.684
You can come tuck me in if you want.

19:03.851 --> 19:05.018
Okay.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.232
Love you.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.598
Apples, right?

19:43.932 --> 19:45.309
-Eventually.
-Hmm.

19:51.899 --> 19:53.400
-Smells...
-Sweet.

19:53.942 --> 19:55.527
I was gonna say real.

19:56.028 --> 19:58.197
Oh, it's all very real, thanks.

19:59.531 --> 20:01.241
I've put the magic behind me.

20:01.325 --> 20:02.534
So I can see.

20:03.243 --> 20:05.787
Well, I knew sooner or later
you'd show up,

20:05.871 --> 20:07.956
wanting to discuss
what happened at Westview.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.836
I made mistakes,
and people were hurt...

20:12.920 --> 20:16.673
But you put things right in the end,
and that was never in doubt.

20:16.840 --> 20:19.718
I'm not here to talk about Westview.

20:19.927 --> 20:20.928
Then what are you here for?

20:21.011 --> 20:22.262
We need your help.

20:25.140 --> 20:26.308
With what?

20:26.475 --> 20:28.477
What do you know about the Multiverse?

20:28.644 --> 20:30.270
- The Multiverse.

20:30.437 --> 20:31.521
Vis had his theories.

20:31.605 --> 20:35.609
He believed it was real,
and dangerous.

20:35.776 --> 20:37.277
Well, he was right about both.

20:37.861 --> 20:40.656
We found a girl
who can somehow travel across it,

20:40.739 --> 20:42.282
but she's being pursued.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.992
-Pursued by who?
-Some kind of demon.

20:44.076 --> 20:46.078
-One that covets her power for itself.
-Ah.

20:46.787 --> 20:50.582
We've taken her to Kamar-Taj,
and we've got our defenses,

20:50.666 --> 20:52.459
but we could use an Avenger.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.336
There are other Avengers.

20:54.419 --> 20:57.089
Yeah, but given the choice
between the archer with the mohawk

20:57.172 --> 20:59.341
and several bug-themed crime fighters,

20:59.424 --> 21:04.346
or one of the most powerful
magic-wielders on the planet...

21:04.513 --> 21:05.847
-...it's an easy call.

21:06.598 --> 21:08.100
Come to Kamar-Taj.

21:09.685 --> 21:11.478
It'll get you back on the lunch box.

21:14.481 --> 21:16.608
What if you brought America here?

21:17.693 --> 21:18.694
Here?

21:19.278 --> 21:22.114
Yeah. I know what it's like
to be on your own,

21:22.197 --> 21:24.783
hunted for abilities you never wanted,

21:25.742 --> 21:27.369
and I can protect her.

21:33.792 --> 21:34.835
You never told me her name, did you?

21:34.918 --> 21:35.961
No.

21:37.296 --> 21:38.755
-Mm.
-No, I didn't.

21:43.593 --> 21:45.554
You know, the Hex was the easy part.

21:46.346 --> 21:49.266
The lying, not so much.

22:16.335 --> 22:17.419
The Darkhold.

22:17.586 --> 22:18.962
You're familiar with the Darkhold?

22:19.129 --> 22:20.964
I know it's the Book of the Damned,

22:21.131 --> 22:24.551
and that it corrupts everything
and everyone that it touches.

22:24.718 --> 22:26.345
I wonder what it's done to you.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.889
The Darkhold only showed me the truth.

22:29.056 --> 22:32.684
Everything I lost can be mine again.

22:32.851 --> 22:34.394
What do you want with America?

22:34.478 --> 22:36.438
What do you want with the Multiverse?

22:36.605 --> 22:38.899
I'm going to leave this reality

22:39.691 --> 22:42.152
and go to one where I can be
with my children.

22:42.319 --> 22:44.613
Wanda, your children aren't real.

22:44.780 --> 22:46.823
You created them using magic.

22:46.990 --> 22:48.617
That's what every mother does.

22:51.411 --> 22:53.163
If you knew

22:53.747 --> 22:56.166
there was a universe

22:56.333 --> 22:58.043
where you were happy,

22:58.210 --> 23:00.170
wouldn't you want to go there?

23:00.629 --> 23:02.172
I am happy.

23:02.339 --> 23:05.092
I know better than most
what self-deception looks like.

23:06.468 --> 23:09.429
What you're doing is a flagrant violation
of every natural law,

23:09.513 --> 23:11.306
and if you take that child's power,

23:11.390 --> 23:12.391
she won't survive.

23:12.557 --> 23:14.684
I don't relish hurting anyone, Stephen.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.020
But she's not a child.

23:17.187 --> 23:19.356
She's a supernatural being.

23:19.523 --> 23:22.109
Such raw power could wreak havoc on this

23:22.192 --> 23:23.402
and other worlds.

23:23.568 --> 23:24.986
Her sacrifice

23:26.071 --> 23:27.280
would be for the greater good.

23:27.364 --> 23:28.907
Well, you can kiss the lunch box goodbye,

23:28.990 --> 23:31.743
'cause that's the kind of justification
our enemies use.

23:31.827 --> 23:33.328
Is it the one you used

23:34.037 --> 23:36.415
when you gave Thanos the Time Stone?

23:39.918 --> 23:43.630
That was a war,
and I did what I had to do.

23:43.797 --> 23:46.091
You break the rules and become a hero.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.176
I do it, and I become the enemy.

23:49.511 --> 23:51.096
That doesn't seem fair.

23:52.722 --> 23:54.141
What happens now?

23:54.349 --> 23:55.934
Return to Kamar-Taj

23:56.101 --> 23:59.229
and prepare to hand over
America Chavez by sundown.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.565
Peacefully.

24:02.774 --> 24:03.984
After that...

24:06.027 --> 24:08.447
You'll never see me again.

24:12.242 --> 24:13.743
And if we don't?

24:18.248 --> 24:20.542
Then it won't be Wanda
who comes for her.

24:21.751 --> 24:23.753
It will be the Scarlet Witch.

24:34.264 --> 24:35.891
The Scarlet Witch.

24:38.935 --> 24:40.228
Wanda's gone.

24:40.896 --> 24:43.565
She's got the Darkhold,
and the Darkhold has her.

24:47.235 --> 24:50.322
The Scarlet Witch is
a being of unfathomable magic.

24:51.364 --> 24:53.700
She can rewrite reality as she chooses,

24:55.202 --> 24:57.662
and is prophesized to either rule

24:57.829 --> 24:59.831
or annihilate the cosmos.

24:59.998 --> 25:03.168
She took over a whole town using her mind.

25:04.544 --> 25:07.130
If she gets America's power,

25:07.297 --> 25:09.633
she could enslave the entire Multiverse.

25:11.551 --> 25:14.346
So, the person you went to ask for help,

25:14.513 --> 25:16.723
and told exactly where I am,

25:16.890 --> 25:18.350
is the person that's trying to kill me?

25:19.809 --> 25:20.852
Yeah.

25:21.561 --> 25:25.148
Suspend teaching at once
and arm the students.

25:25.315 --> 25:27.859
Kamar-Taj must now become a fortress.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.187
Wow.

26:04.354 --> 26:06.815
It's the masters of the Hong Kong
and London Sanctums.

26:07.983 --> 26:11.111
It's an honor to court death
alongside you once again.

26:11.444 --> 26:12.445
The honor is ours.

26:12.529 --> 26:15.031
Whatever the
Sorcerer Supreme asks of us,

26:15.115 --> 26:16.533
it shall be done.

26:17.075 --> 26:18.702
- Extra duty men,
follow me.

26:19.119 --> 26:20.912
It's ancient custom.

27:23.600 --> 27:25.602
Choose your words wisely.

27:25.769 --> 27:28.063
The fate of the Multiverse
may depend on it.

27:28.229 --> 27:29.272
Got it.

27:30.523 --> 27:31.983
No pressure, then.

27:45.163 --> 27:48.291
All this for a child you met yesterday.

27:48.458 --> 27:51.211
Wanda, you are justifiably angry.

27:51.419 --> 27:53.380
You had to make terrible sacrifices.

27:53.463 --> 27:56.174
I blew a hole through the head
of the man I loved,

27:57.509 --> 28:00.303
and it meant nothing.

28:00.470 --> 28:04.432
Do not speak to me of sacrifice,
Stephen Strange.

28:12.440 --> 28:15.485
If you give me what I want,

28:15.652 --> 28:18.321
I'll send you to a world where
you can be with Christine.

28:20.657 --> 28:24.244
The full might of Kamar-Taj
stands against you.

28:25.161 --> 28:28.164
Defensive positions, now!

28:34.754 --> 28:37.090
Do not dare to enter these sacred grounds.

28:37.173 --> 28:40.677
You have no idea
just how reasonable I have been.

28:40.760 --> 28:41.761
- Yeah.

28:41.845 --> 28:43.513
Book of the Damned,
calling yourself a witch,

28:43.596 --> 28:45.056
conjuring creatures to abduct a kid,

28:45.140 --> 28:47.475
I don't exactly call that
being reasonable.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.103
Sending those creatures
after her instead of myself

28:50.186 --> 28:51.688
was mercy.

28:52.522 --> 28:56.568
And in spite of your hypocrisies,
and insults,

28:56.651 --> 29:00.739
I have begged you
to safely get out of my way.

29:02.073 --> 29:04.200
You have exhausted my patience,

29:05.827 --> 29:09.789
but I do hope you understand
that even now,

29:09.956 --> 29:11.458
what's about to happen,

29:12.834 --> 29:14.502
this is me

29:14.669 --> 29:17.338
being reasonable.

29:27.265 --> 29:28.641
- Hold!

29:30.101 --> 29:31.895
Hold!

29:46.367 --> 29:47.577
Nailed it.

29:51.998 --> 29:53.249
Reinforce the shield.

29:53.416 --> 29:54.959
- Reinforce the shield!

29:55.043 --> 29:56.419
- Reinforce the shield!

30:16.606 --> 30:18.024
She's trying to get in their heads.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.402
Sorcerers, fortify your mind!

30:33.832 --> 30:35.500
Run.

30:58.439 --> 31:00.233
- The shield is down!

31:05.071 --> 31:06.197
Fire!

31:09.742 --> 31:10.743
Yes!

31:22.088 --> 31:23.131
Take cover!

31:26.301 --> 31:27.927
Fire at will!

31:40.064 --> 31:41.107
Fall back.

31:42.317 --> 31:43.318
Wong!

31:43.401 --> 31:44.611
Get out of here!

31:50.491 --> 31:51.576
Go, go.

31:51.868 --> 31:52.911
Go!

32:32.450 --> 32:34.535
America...

32:42.210 --> 32:45.213
You want the girl,
you'll have to go through me.

32:45.964 --> 32:46.965
Fine.

33:56.367 --> 33:58.202
We gotta get you out of here. Now.

33:58.661 --> 33:59.871
- Wong, what happened?

34:00.038 --> 34:01.622
- Kamar-Taj has fallen.

34:15.553 --> 34:17.096
Reflections.

34:17.263 --> 34:19.098
She's using the reflections.
Cover them.

34:51.339 --> 34:53.049
- You gave all those lives

34:53.132 --> 34:55.843
just to keep me from my children.

34:56.010 --> 34:57.428
You took those lives.

34:57.804 --> 35:00.473
You cannot be allowed
to cross into the Multiverse.

35:00.973 --> 35:02.725
I'm not a monster, Stephen.

35:03.434 --> 35:04.477
I'm a mother.

35:04.560 --> 35:06.437
Wanda, you have no children.

35:07.563 --> 35:08.689
They don't exist.

35:08.856 --> 35:10.566
- Oh, but they do.

35:10.733 --> 35:12.860
In every other universe.

35:13.778 --> 35:15.279
I know they do.

35:15.988 --> 35:17.782
Because I dream of them

35:18.658 --> 35:21.452
every night.

35:27.834 --> 35:28.918
- We're gonna show it.

35:29.085 --> 35:30.336
- Mom, watch us. Mom!

35:30.419 --> 35:31.671
- Go long. Got it!

35:31.754 --> 35:33.172
All right, go on back, go on back.

35:33.256 --> 35:34.465
- All right, yeah. Don't...

35:35.216 --> 35:36.300
- Of my boys.

35:36.384 --> 35:37.635
- Billy, don't you dare! No!

35:37.718 --> 35:39.512
Of our life together.

35:39.595 --> 35:40.888
-- Here.
-- Yes!

35:40.972 --> 35:42.515
- And then back to front.

35:42.598 --> 35:43.933
Back to front.

35:44.517 --> 35:45.601
- Can I have some?

35:45.685 --> 35:46.686
Please?

35:48.104 --> 35:49.105
-Are you guys ready?
-- It's okay.

35:49.188 --> 35:50.231
- I love you, Mom.

35:50.314 --> 35:51.440
- Every night...

35:53.776 --> 35:55.236
the same dream.

35:56.654 --> 35:58.531
And every morning...

36:01.450 --> 36:04.620
the same nightmare.

36:07.540 --> 36:09.208
What if you reach them?

36:10.835 --> 36:12.628
What happens to the other you?

36:14.088 --> 36:16.132
What happens to their mother?

38:03.322 --> 38:04.532
You okay?

38:06.200 --> 38:07.493
You saved me.

38:08.202 --> 38:09.787
I hope so.

38:13.541 --> 38:14.542
Surprised you didn't puke.

38:15.084 --> 38:17.461
It's not my first weird trip, kid.

38:18.045 --> 38:20.673
So, this is New York
in the Multi...

38:21.757 --> 38:23.467
-Yep.

38:23.926 --> 38:24.969
There it is.

38:31.517 --> 38:32.768
Crap.

38:35.104 --> 38:36.355
Cut it out.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.610
Yeah, you got pretty dinged up.

38:42.987 --> 38:44.405
We'll get you fixed.

38:44.947 --> 38:46.115
All right, America.

38:46.907 --> 38:49.076
You gotta open a portal
and get us back there right now.

38:49.160 --> 38:50.244
I don't know how.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.454
You just did it.

38:51.537 --> 38:52.538
Not on purpose.

38:52.621 --> 38:55.583
Wong is back there alone with Wanda,
and I'm the only hope he has.

38:55.666 --> 38:56.834
I can't control my powers...

38:56.917 --> 38:58.377
You must be able to control it somehow.

38:58.461 --> 38:59.503
Even I could...

39:02.298 --> 39:03.466
Sorry.

39:04.800 --> 39:07.178
Well, what about this
universe's version of you?

39:07.261 --> 39:09.138
Maybe she could
control her powers.

39:09.221 --> 39:11.140
This universe doesn't have a me.

39:11.223 --> 39:13.017
-What?
-None of them do.

39:13.100 --> 39:14.143
But how do you know that?

39:14.226 --> 39:15.770
'Cause I've looked.

39:17.229 --> 39:19.357
And 'cause I never dream.

39:26.447 --> 39:28.157
That's okay, kid.

39:28.324 --> 39:31.410
And even if you could get me back there,
I have no way of fighting Wanda.

39:31.994 --> 39:33.079
What about The Book of Vishanti?

39:33.162 --> 39:34.163
What about it?

39:34.246 --> 39:35.498
Other You thought it could stop

39:35.581 --> 39:36.582
whoever was after me.

39:36.707 --> 39:38.751
Yeah, well, good for Other Me.
He's not here, is he?

39:38.834 --> 39:41.879
I don't know where it is,
so unless there's another Other Me...

39:44.131 --> 39:45.466
We need to go find...

39:46.300 --> 39:48.761
Other Other Me.

40:20.626 --> 40:21.627
We go on red?

40:21.710 --> 40:24.380
Rule number one of Multiversal travel,

40:24.547 --> 40:25.965
you don't know anything.

40:26.632 --> 40:27.633
Right.

40:31.095 --> 40:32.221
It's red.

40:34.056 --> 40:36.225
So, what's rule number two?

40:39.520 --> 40:40.646
America?

40:43.441 --> 40:44.525
America!

40:45.568 --> 40:46.569
Rule number two,

40:46.735 --> 40:48.028
find food.

40:48.195 --> 40:50.156
Preferably pizza. Pizza balls.

40:51.115 --> 40:52.283
How'd you pay for that?

40:52.366 --> 40:53.367
- It was free.

40:53.534 --> 40:55.786
Food's free
in most universes, actually.

40:55.953 --> 40:57.830
It's weird you guys have to pay for it.

40:57.997 --> 40:59.790
-Hey! You didn't pay for that.
-- Right.

41:00.040 --> 41:01.083
Crap.

41:01.250 --> 41:02.460
Maybe it's not free here.

41:02.626 --> 41:04.587
Pizza Poppa always gets paid.

41:04.670 --> 41:06.589
All right, Pizza Poppa, relax.
She's just a kid...

41:06.672 --> 41:07.923
-She was hungry.
-Relax yourself, there,

41:08.007 --> 41:09.133
Doctor Strange.

41:10.384 --> 41:12.261
Where'd you get
this cape from, anyway?

41:12.344 --> 41:14.054
Oh, that feels authentic.

41:14.138 --> 41:16.056
It's not a cape, it's a cloak,
and I suggest you let go.

41:16.140 --> 41:19.518
You took this whole suit
from the Strange Museum, didn't you?

41:19.685 --> 41:21.479
-Strange Museum?
-You're a taker.

41:21.645 --> 41:23.189
Why don't you take some mustard, huh?

41:32.740 --> 41:34.074
Come on. It's not permanent.

41:35.284 --> 41:36.911
Like he'll stop in a few minutes?

41:37.828 --> 41:39.830
-About three weeks.

41:42.875 --> 41:45.002
Those universes we went through,

41:45.169 --> 41:47.338
were we paint in one of them?

41:47.505 --> 41:49.840
Yeah, you don't wanna get stuck in there.

41:50.007 --> 41:51.550
It's really hard to eat.

41:52.801 --> 41:54.637
How many universes have you been to?

41:55.554 --> 41:56.680
Uh...

41:56.764 --> 41:57.848
Seventy-two.

41:58.432 --> 41:59.767
Seventy-three, counting this one.

41:59.850 --> 42:00.935
That's...

42:01.560 --> 42:02.645
That's a lot.

42:02.811 --> 42:04.021
- Memory Lane.

42:04.104 --> 42:05.731
Replay your significant memories,

42:05.814 --> 42:07.525
now at a discounted price.

42:07.608 --> 42:10.069
We remember so you don't forget.

42:16.492 --> 42:18.327
- This is pretty fancy.

42:18.869 --> 42:21.038
Did you have to take out
another student loan?

42:21.121 --> 42:25.000
Nah. I just sold one of those kidneys
that we operated on last week.

42:27.628 --> 42:30.506
So, um, got you a little something.

42:33.133 --> 42:34.885
Congratulations.

42:35.469 --> 42:36.679
What is it?

42:37.012 --> 42:38.347
- Open it and see.

42:43.477 --> 42:44.979
Christine, this is...

42:46.272 --> 42:47.940
This is amazing. Thank you.

42:49.567 --> 42:51.026
We don't have time for this.

42:53.862 --> 42:55.030
- Memory Lane.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.865
Replay your significant memories,

42:57.032 --> 42:58.701
now at a discounted price.

42:58.784 --> 43:00.786
We remember so you don't forget.

43:07.918 --> 43:09.336
- Where's this?

43:11.297 --> 43:12.673
Home.

43:13.799 --> 43:15.092
My moms.

43:16.719 --> 43:18.095
Son mis madres.

43:18.596 --> 43:21.724
¿Para mí? Ay, qué linda.

43:22.725 --> 43:23.726
Gracias.

43:24.893 --> 43:26.729
A ver, te la pongo.

43:28.022 --> 43:29.607
Mm. Tan hermosa.

43:30.649 --> 43:31.859
Te ves bella.

43:33.235 --> 43:35.321
Ándale, nos van a dar otra flor.

43:41.994 --> 43:43.454
- America!

44:02.097 --> 44:04.266
You know, you were right.
This is just a waste of time.

44:04.433 --> 44:05.476
Hey, kid.

44:06.185 --> 44:09.146
That was the first time
that you opened a portal, right?

44:09.313 --> 44:10.314
- Doesn't matter.

44:10.439 --> 44:12.024
It does matter.
You lost your parents.

44:12.191 --> 44:14.485
I didn't lose them.
I killed them.

44:14.568 --> 44:16.570
No. No, you did not.
Don't even think that.

44:16.737 --> 44:19.490
Okay, I opened a portal
with the powers I can't control

44:19.573 --> 44:21.533
and sent them to a random,
probably deadly universe,

44:21.617 --> 44:22.701
-with no way to escape.
-Listen,

44:22.785 --> 44:25.287
if your moms are
anything like their daughter,

44:25.454 --> 44:26.622
they survived.

44:27.331 --> 44:29.541
I'm sure you'll meet them again someday.

44:33.754 --> 44:34.797
Not bad.

44:36.048 --> 44:37.508
Thanks.

44:39.009 --> 44:40.969
That woman in your memory bank thing,

44:41.136 --> 44:42.429
that was Christine, right?

44:43.681 --> 44:45.933
Yes, that was Christine.

44:46.100 --> 44:47.893
-How do you know her?
-From Other You.

44:48.519 --> 44:49.687
Were they together?

44:49.770 --> 44:51.313
No, they didn't talk anymore.

44:51.397 --> 44:52.481
He blew it.

44:52.564 --> 44:53.565
Of course.

44:54.692 --> 44:56.485
Did you blow it with your Christine?

44:57.986 --> 44:59.863
Yes, I guess I did.

45:00.030 --> 45:01.031
Why?

45:01.615 --> 45:03.450
Complicated.

45:03.534 --> 45:05.035
More complicated
than being chased by a witch

45:05.119 --> 45:06.120
through the Multiverse?

45:06.203 --> 45:08.163
Yes, actually, it is.

45:48.787 --> 45:50.247
"Gave his life defeating Thanos"?

45:50.330 --> 45:52.291
Yeah. See? We're not all bad.

45:53.542 --> 45:55.419
If Other You's dead,

45:55.627 --> 45:57.379
who's Master of the Sanctum?

46:03.385 --> 46:05.345
Oh, shit.

46:15.189 --> 46:17.608
-You know him?
-Yeah. Mordo.

46:17.691 --> 46:19.735
He was actually the first guy
who let me into Kamar-Taj.

46:19.818 --> 46:20.819
Oh, great.

46:20.903 --> 46:21.904
And then he snapped

46:21.987 --> 46:24.072
and dedicated his life
to trying to kill me.

46:24.239 --> 46:25.616
Oh.

46:25.783 --> 46:27.034
Great.

46:31.663 --> 46:33.999
- I always suspected
this day would come.

46:34.082 --> 46:35.083
You did?

46:35.501 --> 46:36.502
Yes.

46:37.336 --> 46:41.131
Because you always suspected
this day would come.

46:49.348 --> 46:51.350
My brother.

46:54.853 --> 46:55.854
All right.

46:57.940 --> 46:59.316
- Come in,

46:59.399 --> 47:03.654
and tell me everything
about your universe.

47:08.992 --> 47:10.619
You go on red.

47:13.288 --> 47:15.415
- And you're quite
formidable too, it seems.

47:15.749 --> 47:18.252
A Multiversal traveler.

47:18.335 --> 47:21.672
Well, thank the stars
you brought Doctor Strange to safety.

47:21.755 --> 47:24.508
Well, just 'cause we jumped ship
doesn't mean we're safe.

47:24.591 --> 47:27.761
Our Wanda has the ability
to conjure demons and monsters

47:27.845 --> 47:30.264
to attack America in other universes.

47:30.347 --> 47:31.890
So she has the Darkhold?

47:31.974 --> 47:33.475
Oh, you know of the Darkhold?

47:33.559 --> 47:36.270
Oh, yes. We have a Darkhold
in this universe, too.

47:36.436 --> 47:38.522
I guard it here in this Sanctum.

47:38.605 --> 47:41.024
We would never
risk a weapon that dangerous

47:41.108 --> 47:42.484
falling into the wrong hands.

47:42.568 --> 47:43.694
Damn right.

47:43.777 --> 47:45.571
But if your Darkhold
is anything like ours,

47:45.654 --> 47:47.197
I'm afraid she can do far worse

47:47.281 --> 47:50.826
than just summon monsters
to come after you here.

47:51.410 --> 47:52.411
What do you mean?

47:52.619 --> 47:56.748
There is a spell contained
within those pages...

47:58.333 --> 48:00.168
...corrosive to the soul,

48:01.795 --> 48:04.298
a desecration of reality itself.

48:06.216 --> 48:07.217
Dreamwalking.

48:09.261 --> 48:12.431
A Dreamwalking sorcerer
projects their own consciousness

48:12.598 --> 48:15.142
from their universe into another,

48:16.143 --> 48:19.062
possessing the body of an alternate self.

48:21.982 --> 48:24.776
They may puppeteer
this unholy doppelganger

48:24.860 --> 48:27.237
and pursue their enemies from afar.

48:30.657 --> 48:33.035
The possession is not a permanent link

48:33.118 --> 48:34.870
between realities.

48:35.037 --> 48:37.623
But in the fleeting time they Dreamwalk,

48:37.789 --> 48:41.668
they can do irreparable damage
to the universe they invade.

48:44.463 --> 48:47.382
So it may not be a demon that you face.

48:49.635 --> 48:52.429
It may be the Scarlet Witch.

48:54.514 --> 48:56.016
Why didn't she do that to begin with?

48:56.099 --> 48:58.435
- Because that
was her being reasonable.

48:59.686 --> 49:01.229
What do you know of The Book of Vishanti?

49:01.396 --> 49:02.940
The Darkhold's antithesis?

49:04.066 --> 49:05.317
It can give a sorcerer

49:05.400 --> 49:08.362
whatever power they need
to vanquish their enemy.

49:10.155 --> 49:12.699
I need your help
to get me to it.

49:16.286 --> 49:17.537
I'm sorry, Stephen.

49:19.081 --> 49:22.793
But I hope you,
of all people, understand

49:23.210 --> 49:25.337
that it is not Wanda Maximoff

49:25.420 --> 49:27.673
who threatens our reality,

49:28.799 --> 49:31.259
it's the two of you.

49:31.343 --> 49:33.512
-- Oh, God.
-What was in that tea?

49:37.391 --> 49:41.103
You son of a bitch.

49:51.822 --> 49:53.865
The Sands of Nisanti.

49:54.658 --> 49:57.828
I'm only acting as you would.

50:00.664 --> 50:02.708
She's coming.

50:25.772 --> 50:26.898
- Boys, it's time for bed.

50:26.982 --> 50:28.608
- Can we have
a little more ice cream?

50:28.692 --> 50:29.985
-- Please.
-- Please, please, please!

50:30.068 --> 50:31.069
A little more, please!

50:31.153 --> 50:32.529
- Hey, don't make Mom
out to be the bad guy.

50:32.612 --> 50:33.697
- You know who's the best?

50:33.780 --> 50:36.158
-- Who?
-- 2003 Tigers.

50:36.241 --> 50:37.242
- They suck.

50:37.325 --> 50:39.369
-They're so bad they suck egg.

50:39.453 --> 50:41.204
- No, they don't.
They're the best.

50:41.288 --> 50:43.081
-- Doofus.
-- Doofus 2.

50:43.248 --> 50:45.083
- Triple infinity doofus.

50:45.167 --> 50:48.462
- Infinity infinity
googolplex quadruple doofus.

50:48.628 --> 50:52.049
- Quintuple infinity...
Crazy doofus.

50:52.215 --> 50:53.842
-- Googolplex doofus.

51:45.060 --> 51:46.103
- Mom?

51:51.566 --> 51:53.193
Yes, sweetheart?

51:53.276 --> 51:54.694
- Where are you going?

51:58.406 --> 52:00.867
Just to take out the trash.

52:02.119 --> 52:03.787
- Can we show you something?

52:05.872 --> 52:08.291
- Mom, hurry, come on!

52:08.375 --> 52:09.793
- Come on, it's important.

52:09.876 --> 52:10.877
- Mom.

52:10.961 --> 52:12.712
- You'll like it.

52:12.796 --> 52:15.423
- Come on. Hurry up.

52:15.507 --> 52:16.633
- It's important.

52:17.592 --> 52:20.428
Okay, so, Mom, listen to this...

52:20.512 --> 52:21.513
I'm gonna start it.

52:21.596 --> 52:22.848
-No, I wanna start it.
-I wanna start it.

52:22.931 --> 52:23.932
-I want to start!
-No, I want to start!

52:24.015 --> 52:25.058
-No! I want to start.
-I want to start.

52:25.142 --> 52:29.646
Why don't you both start it,

52:29.729 --> 52:33.024
whatever it is, together?

52:34.192 --> 52:35.485
-Okay.

52:35.569 --> 52:36.820
-You ready?
-Yeah.

52:36.903 --> 52:39.614
Three, two, one, go.

52:39.906 --> 52:43.160
We like ice cream

52:43.243 --> 52:46.663
Like every child should

52:46.746 --> 52:50.417
And if we get some ice cream

52:50.500 --> 52:55.839
We promise to be good

53:23.867 --> 53:24.868
You're alive.

53:25.577 --> 53:26.578
Yes.

53:27.204 --> 53:29.122
But so many others were lost.

53:31.041 --> 53:32.417
Set me free.

53:32.584 --> 53:34.085
I need to destroy the book.

53:34.252 --> 53:37.047
No. It cannot be you.

53:44.846 --> 53:47.098
-Sara. No, no!

54:05.784 --> 54:07.202
-- Mom!

54:07.369 --> 54:08.578
- What happened?

54:10.956 --> 54:12.249
-What?
-Are you okay?

54:15.085 --> 54:17.379
Okay. Billy, Tommy.

54:18.964 --> 54:19.965
What?

54:25.804 --> 54:29.683
No, no, no.

54:49.828 --> 54:51.830
I need the Darkhold's spells.

54:51.913 --> 54:54.457
You are the Sorcerer Supreme.

54:54.666 --> 54:55.875
Tell me what you know.

54:57.669 --> 54:59.462
You're gonna have to kill me, witch.

55:00.171 --> 55:01.339
Not you.

55:02.757 --> 55:04.009
Them.

55:10.140 --> 55:11.308
- Wanda, stop.

55:14.019 --> 55:15.312
Wanda, please!

55:20.317 --> 55:22.319
The Darkhold was a copy!

55:25.071 --> 55:26.281
A copy?

55:26.448 --> 55:27.741
Legend speaks of a mountain

55:27.907 --> 55:30.577
with the wretched spells you seek
carved into its walls.

55:31.911 --> 55:34.581
It's there the Darkhold was transcribed.

55:35.540 --> 55:36.791
Mount Wundagore.

55:37.792 --> 55:39.127
Wundagore?

55:39.919 --> 55:41.796
No one has survived the journey.

55:46.176 --> 55:48.887
Perhaps we will be the exception.

55:56.227 --> 55:57.604
- Hey!

55:57.687 --> 55:59.647
-Hey!

56:12.160 --> 56:13.953
This universe sucks.

56:16.873 --> 56:17.957
Cloak?

56:29.427 --> 56:30.428
Hey.

56:32.222 --> 56:33.473
Hey, lab coat.

56:34.224 --> 56:35.308
Where the hell are we?

56:36.726 --> 56:37.727
Look, I don't know who you are,

56:37.811 --> 56:39.687
or what you think
you're trying to do here,

56:39.771 --> 56:41.189
but these situations don't usually...

56:41.272 --> 56:42.315
-- Thank you.
-...work out well

56:42.399 --> 56:44.567
for the nameless scientists, so just...

56:49.155 --> 56:50.448
Christine?

56:52.283 --> 56:53.368
Hello, Stephen.

56:53.868 --> 56:55.036
Ay Dios.

56:55.912 --> 56:57.038
Miss Chavez.

56:58.498 --> 56:59.999
Uh, to answer your question,

57:00.166 --> 57:02.627
you are in a highly secure
research facility.

57:02.794 --> 57:05.004
The two of you,
along with your sentient cloak,

57:05.088 --> 57:07.048
are here for surveillance and testing.

57:07.132 --> 57:09.259
Uh... Uh, testing?

57:09.342 --> 57:11.928
Well, yes.
You're visitors from another universe.

57:12.095 --> 57:15.640
Your magnetic signatures
could be radioactive,

57:15.807 --> 57:18.435
you may be carrying diseases
we just don't have treatments for.

57:19.227 --> 57:22.147
Hence, these amazing
polycarbonate fish bowls.

57:23.606 --> 57:26.234
I assume I have you
to thank for these then?

57:26.734 --> 57:29.946
Yes. I developed those
using the Sands of Nisanti.

57:30.113 --> 57:32.407
One of 838 Stephen's magical relics.

57:32.574 --> 57:33.616
838 Stephen?

57:33.700 --> 57:35.285
Is that some kind of cyborg me, or...

57:35.368 --> 57:37.287
Our universe is 838,

57:37.370 --> 57:39.747
and we've designated yours 616.

57:39.998 --> 57:42.750
Oh. You guys sure must know
a lot about the Multiverse

57:42.917 --> 57:45.086
if you got someone
going around naming realities.

57:45.253 --> 57:46.254
Yes.

57:47.005 --> 57:48.256
Me.

57:48.423 --> 57:50.425
I'm a senior fellow
with the Baxter Foundation,

57:50.508 --> 57:52.552
and I specialize in Multiversal research.

57:54.888 --> 57:57.015
- So,
how'd you end up working here?

57:57.098 --> 57:59.058
Wherever here is.

57:59.225 --> 58:00.560
- Well, I volunteered.

58:01.144 --> 58:02.520
At your funeral.

58:03.730 --> 58:05.064
Thank you for going.

58:05.565 --> 58:07.609
Your injuries, they're similar,

58:07.692 --> 58:08.860
but they're not identical.

58:08.943 --> 58:10.153
It's fascinating.

58:15.909 --> 58:20.246
What were we to each other
in this universe?

58:23.917 --> 58:25.919
We never quite figured that out.

58:26.211 --> 58:27.337
Yeah?

58:28.963 --> 58:31.049
Well, that's something we got in common.

58:33.843 --> 58:37.096
Christine, you gotta let us out of here.

58:37.931 --> 58:39.641
Everyone's in real danger.

58:39.724 --> 58:41.768
Look, I know you don't know me...

58:41.893 --> 58:42.894
And I don't want to.

58:43.436 --> 58:45.939
Whatever I was to you in your universe

58:46.022 --> 58:47.232
does not matter.

58:48.483 --> 58:49.567
Why not?

58:54.531 --> 58:56.241
Because you're dangerous, Stephen.

58:58.034 --> 59:00.578
Someone from my universe
wants that girl,

59:00.662 --> 59:03.456
and she's gonna rip this place
apart atom-by-atom

59:03.540 --> 59:05.166
until she gets what she wants.

59:05.250 --> 59:07.627
So I don't care
if you're from the Avengers

59:07.710 --> 59:08.711
or S.H.I.E.L.D...

59:08.795 --> 59:09.837
- We're neither.

59:15.718 --> 59:16.928
Well, what then?

59:17.095 --> 59:18.137
HYDRA?

59:18.221 --> 59:22.392
The Illuminati will see you now.

59:22.475 --> 59:23.768
The Illumi-what-y?

59:31.859 --> 59:33.486
Don't let anyone hurt that kid.

59:37.782 --> 59:39.158
It's gonna be okay.

1:00:08.771 --> 1:00:11.357
You couldn't portal us up there?

1:00:11.524 --> 1:00:13.943
My magic can only take us so far.

1:00:14.319 --> 1:00:16.613
Masters of the Mystic Arts
weren't meant to tread

1:00:16.779 --> 1:00:19.157
upon the forbidden grounds of Wundagore.

1:00:44.307 --> 1:00:48.853
- Eons ago, the first demon, Chthon,

1:00:48.936 --> 1:00:52.649
carved his dark magic into this tomb.

1:00:52.815 --> 1:00:57.570
These same spells were later transcribed
into the Darkhold.

1:01:13.002 --> 1:01:16.547
There's no telling
what soulless monstrosities lie within.

1:01:59.257 --> 1:02:00.967
They've been waiting for me.

1:02:09.058 --> 1:02:10.977
This isn't a tomb.

1:02:15.148 --> 1:02:16.733
It's a throne.

1:02:51.768 --> 1:02:53.478
- Stephen Strange,

1:02:54.145 --> 1:02:56.773
you are now called before the Illuminati.

1:02:56.981 --> 1:02:59.233
I, Baron Karl Mordo,

1:02:59.317 --> 1:03:00.818
the Sorcerer Supreme, do hereby...

1:03:00.902 --> 1:03:02.028
"Karl"?

1:03:06.324 --> 1:03:08.451
-- Captain Carter.

1:03:08.534 --> 1:03:09.744
The first Avenger.

1:03:10.787 --> 1:03:12.121
Blackagar Boltagon.

1:03:12.205 --> 1:03:15.124
Keeper of the Terrigen Mists,
the Inhuman king.

1:03:15.291 --> 1:03:17.418
Blackagar Boltagard? Huh.

1:03:17.835 --> 1:03:19.045
Hidigy hidithere.

1:03:20.838 --> 1:03:23.382
Captain Marvel.
Defender of the cosmos.

1:03:25.426 --> 1:03:27.470
And the smartest man alive,

1:03:27.637 --> 1:03:30.223
Reed Richards of the Fantastic Four.

1:03:31.557 --> 1:03:32.558
Hello, Stephen.

1:03:32.642 --> 1:03:35.144
"Fantastic Four."
Didn't you guys chart in the '60s?

1:03:35.228 --> 1:03:37.396
I'm sorry, is this a joke to you?

1:03:37.480 --> 1:03:38.898
Well, there's a guy over there
with a fork on his head,

1:03:38.981 --> 1:03:40.274
so, yeah, a little bit.

1:03:41.734 --> 1:03:44.278
Be grateful Black Bolt doesn't
engage you in conversation.

1:03:44.362 --> 1:03:46.113
Why? Does he have bad breath?

1:03:46.489 --> 1:03:48.324
This Strange is even
more arrogant than ours.

1:03:48.574 --> 1:03:50.535
-Hmm.
-No, just more alive.

1:03:50.701 --> 1:03:51.828
For now.

1:03:53.412 --> 1:03:54.789
- Stephen, your arrival here

1:03:54.872 --> 1:03:57.291
confuses and destabilizes reality.

1:03:58.125 --> 1:03:59.710
The larger the footprint you leave behind,

1:03:59.794 --> 1:04:01.587
the greater the risk of an Incursion.

1:04:01.671 --> 1:04:02.672
Incursion?

1:04:02.755 --> 1:04:03.840
- An Incursion occurs

1:04:03.923 --> 1:04:07.009
when the boundary
between two universes erodes

1:04:07.176 --> 1:04:08.386
and they collide,

1:04:09.136 --> 1:04:13.140
destroying one or both entirely.

1:04:13.808 --> 1:04:16.561
Your alternate self created the Illuminati

1:04:16.644 --> 1:04:19.188
to make difficult decisions
that no one else could.

1:04:19.272 --> 1:04:23.067
Today, we're here to determine
what to do with you and the child.

1:04:23.234 --> 1:04:24.986
- So, before we vote,

1:04:25.069 --> 1:04:28.823
if you got anything serious to say,
now's the time.

1:04:28.906 --> 1:04:30.199
- Yeah, I do.

1:04:30.283 --> 1:04:31.659
If it's Incursions you're worried about,

1:04:31.742 --> 1:04:34.453
do you seriously think I'm a bigger threat
than the Scarlet Witch?

1:04:34.537 --> 1:04:37.665
Oh, we can handle your little witch
if she decides to Dreamwalk.

1:04:37.832 --> 1:04:39.083
No. No, you cannot.

1:04:39.166 --> 1:04:41.252
Not unless you give me
The Book of Vishanti.

1:04:41.335 --> 1:04:42.795
We appreciate your concern, Stephen,

1:04:42.879 --> 1:04:45.047
but it's not the Scarlet Witch
that we fear.

1:04:45.131 --> 1:04:46.883
From our experience, the greatest danger

1:04:46.966 --> 1:04:48.926
to the Multiverse, it turns out,

1:04:49.093 --> 1:04:50.720
is Doctor Strange.

1:04:51.596 --> 1:04:53.639
Wait. Your Doctor Strange?

1:04:53.723 --> 1:04:56.309
Earth's mightiest hero
who died defeating Thanos?

1:04:56.392 --> 1:04:58.185
We should tell him the truth.

1:05:06.277 --> 1:05:07.528
- Our final member,

1:05:08.779 --> 1:05:10.615
Professor Charles Xavier.

1:05:12.491 --> 1:05:13.492
What truth?

1:05:13.576 --> 1:05:16.245
That's not how our Strange died.

1:05:34.013 --> 1:05:36.015
You're wondering what happens now.

1:05:36.766 --> 1:05:38.017
No.

1:05:38.184 --> 1:05:39.810
That I've already accepted.

1:05:40.478 --> 1:05:41.687
But I do wonder

1:05:43.189 --> 1:05:46.734
when you could force America
to send you to any universe you want,

1:05:46.901 --> 1:05:48.778
why take her power for your own?

1:05:48.861 --> 1:05:50.696
You know it would kill her.

1:05:50.780 --> 1:05:52.615
For Billy and Tommy, to protect them.

1:05:53.824 --> 1:05:55.159
What if they get sick?

1:05:56.285 --> 1:05:59.372
In the infinite Multiverse,
there's a cure for every illness.

1:06:00.665 --> 1:06:04.001
A solution to every problem.

1:06:06.379 --> 1:06:08.339
I won't lose them again.

1:06:08.422 --> 1:06:11.509
Try as you might, Wanda,
you cannot control everything.

1:06:11.592 --> 1:06:13.219
But I can.

1:06:13.386 --> 1:06:15.012
Look around you.

1:06:15.638 --> 1:06:17.890
It's carved in stone.

1:06:19.934 --> 1:06:22.269
I was meant to rule everything.

1:06:27.024 --> 1:06:28.985
But that's not what I want.

1:06:29.694 --> 1:06:30.945
I just want my boys.

1:06:31.028 --> 1:06:33.072
At the cost of a child's life?

1:06:34.281 --> 1:06:35.825
Is there no peace in knowing

1:06:35.908 --> 1:06:38.285
that even though you can't be
with the ones you love,

1:06:38.369 --> 1:06:40.579
there are worlds
where you are together?

1:06:40.746 --> 1:06:41.747
Is that not enough?

1:06:42.289 --> 1:06:43.541
-No.

1:07:21.287 --> 1:07:24.081
Our Strange did not die defeating Thanos.

1:07:24.707 --> 1:07:26.417
We were at war.

1:07:26.584 --> 1:07:30.296
While the rest of us banded together
to try to stop Thanos,

1:07:30.463 --> 1:07:34.425
Stephen, as always, chose to go it alone.

1:07:34.592 --> 1:07:36.302
- He turned to the Darkhold,

1:07:36.469 --> 1:07:38.054
began Dreamwalking,

1:07:38.220 --> 1:07:40.765
in hopes that our salvation
might lie in the Multiverse.

1:07:41.140 --> 1:07:42.349
- And guess what?

1:07:42.516 --> 1:07:45.102
It didn't.
But he kept doing it anyway.

1:07:45.311 --> 1:07:47.271
- One night,
you called us all together,

1:07:47.354 --> 1:07:49.398
confessed that
you had been Dreamwalking,

1:07:49.565 --> 1:07:52.860
and in your words,
"Things had gotten out of hand."

1:07:53.027 --> 1:07:55.321
You never told us the details
of what had happened,

1:07:55.404 --> 1:07:57.323
only that you had
inadvertently triggered

1:07:57.406 --> 1:07:58.574
an Incursion.

1:07:59.075 --> 1:08:00.451
You, our friend,

1:08:00.993 --> 1:08:04.455
had caused the annihilation
of another universe.

1:08:04.830 --> 1:08:07.249
Everyone in that reality died.

1:08:07.416 --> 1:08:08.417
Everyone.

1:08:08.584 --> 1:08:10.753
Stephen renounced the Darkhold's evil

1:08:10.920 --> 1:08:13.047
and helped us find
The Book of Vishanti,

1:08:13.214 --> 1:08:17.343
a weapon we did use together
to defeat Thanos.

1:08:17.510 --> 1:08:19.678
But one final threat remained.

1:08:47.665 --> 1:08:50.084
I shall miss you, my friend.

1:08:53.963 --> 1:08:55.339
I'm ready.

1:09:03.430 --> 1:09:05.641
I'm sorry.

1:09:27.329 --> 1:09:28.956
Did you tell Christine?

1:09:30.207 --> 1:09:31.292
Yes.

1:09:36.964 --> 1:09:37.965
The statue...

1:09:38.048 --> 1:09:39.508
What about the statue?

1:09:42.511 --> 1:09:43.762
You built a statue.

1:09:43.846 --> 1:09:45.556
The world needs heroes.

1:09:46.348 --> 1:09:47.349
We made the difficult choice

1:09:47.433 --> 1:09:49.435
because we knew what
our Strange was capable of.

1:09:51.061 --> 1:09:52.438
What, perhaps,

1:09:52.521 --> 1:09:55.232
every Doctor Strange is capable of.

1:09:59.069 --> 1:10:00.362
The building's been breached.

1:10:00.529 --> 1:10:02.489
-No shit, genius.

1:10:02.990 --> 1:10:04.575
Status report on sentries.

1:10:06.952 --> 1:10:07.995
Stop where you...

1:10:08.537 --> 1:10:10.539
-- Get back!

1:10:15.085 --> 1:10:17.129
Stop where you are...

1:10:17.213 --> 1:10:18.505
She's heading for the child.

1:10:18.589 --> 1:10:20.382
Watch him.
We'll vote on our return.

1:10:22.134 --> 1:10:24.929
Stephen, should you manage
to escape this chamber,

1:10:25.095 --> 1:10:27.097
you must guide America Chavez.

1:10:27.264 --> 1:10:28.557
What the hell are you saying?

1:10:28.682 --> 1:10:31.018
Save the girl
and get to The Book of Vishanti.

1:10:31.185 --> 1:10:32.645
What? You have the book here?

1:10:32.728 --> 1:10:35.064
Yes. You built a waypoint.

1:10:35.147 --> 1:10:37.316
Charles, we cannot trust him.

1:10:37.483 --> 1:10:39.443
I believe we can.

1:10:40.194 --> 1:10:42.738
Just because someone stumbles
and loses their way

1:10:42.821 --> 1:10:44.657
doesn't mean they're lost forever.

1:10:45.366 --> 1:10:49.119
We will see what kind
of Doctor Strange you are.

1:10:49.912 --> 1:10:50.913
Thank you.

1:10:51.789 --> 1:10:53.457
Perimeter breakdown.

1:10:53.540 --> 1:10:56.627
-All sentries engage.

1:10:58.295 --> 1:10:59.296
Everybody out.

1:10:59.380 --> 1:11:00.923
-Intruder approaching.
-- Now!

1:11:03.259 --> 1:11:04.385
It's Wanda.

1:11:17.398 --> 1:11:19.858
Ultron commands you to halt.

1:11:21.986 --> 1:11:24.029
Ultron commands...

1:11:27.157 --> 1:11:28.701
Hurry, hurry! She's coming!

1:11:33.247 --> 1:11:34.415
Oh, no.

1:11:55.936 --> 1:11:57.187
- Wanda, stop.

1:11:58.022 --> 1:12:00.816
You've possessed an innocent woman,
but you can still do the right thing.

1:12:01.734 --> 1:12:02.901
Let her go.

1:12:06.071 --> 1:12:07.072
Please.

1:12:07.740 --> 1:12:10.784
I have children of my own.
I understand your pain.

1:12:10.951 --> 1:12:13.287
Is their mother still alive?

1:12:14.496 --> 1:12:15.497
Yes.

1:12:15.664 --> 1:12:19.877
Good. There will be
someone left to raise them.

1:12:22.504 --> 1:12:26.508
Wanda, Black Bolt could destroy you
with one whisper from his mouth.

1:12:28.427 --> 1:12:29.428
What mouth?

1:13:27.277 --> 1:13:30.614
Take me to The Book of Vishanti,
so that we can fight her together.

1:13:30.781 --> 1:13:32.741
You are in no position to give orders.

1:13:34.076 --> 1:13:37.079
My vote will conclude these proceedings
when they return.

1:13:49.508 --> 1:13:50.634
Haven't you had enough?

1:13:51.844 --> 1:13:53.262
Oh, I could do this all day.

1:14:29.631 --> 1:14:32.259
Get the hell out of my universe!

1:15:06.210 --> 1:15:07.836
They're not coming back.

1:15:08.003 --> 1:15:11.215
And you just cast your vote now
to kill your friends.

1:15:15.093 --> 1:15:16.720
Not that that ever bothered you before.

1:15:19.806 --> 1:15:22.017
You know, you hated me
where I came from.

1:15:22.184 --> 1:15:23.852
And I bet secretly, my brother,

1:15:23.936 --> 1:15:25.187
you hated me here.

1:15:25.270 --> 1:15:27.231
You must've been so jealous.

1:15:27.731 --> 1:15:28.732
Do you know what?

1:15:28.815 --> 1:15:30.943
I bet you were thrilled
when you heard I'd been corrupted.

1:15:31.026 --> 1:15:32.861
Hell, you probably gave me
the Darkhold to begin with...

1:15:32.945 --> 1:15:34.780
You know nothing of this universe!

1:15:34.863 --> 1:15:38.575
I know that killing Stephen Strange
was your ticket to getting the Sanctum,

1:15:38.742 --> 1:15:40.202
to becoming Sorcerer Supreme,

1:15:40.369 --> 1:15:42.037
and to joining
your little circus of clowns,

1:15:42.120 --> 1:15:43.121
the Illuminati.

1:15:43.205 --> 1:15:44.665
I'm ready...

1:15:47.709 --> 1:15:50.629
-to cast my vote now.

1:16:55.777 --> 1:16:57.571
I think I'm beginning to understand

1:16:57.988 --> 1:17:01.700
why your Mordo
didn't like you very much!

1:17:04.244 --> 1:17:05.245
You're sealed shut!

1:17:15.130 --> 1:17:16.798
Okay. Get back.

1:17:28.060 --> 1:17:30.103
-Whoa.

1:17:34.733 --> 1:17:35.817
- Enough!

1:18:30.914 --> 1:18:32.958
Help me. Please.

1:18:33.125 --> 1:18:35.752
Wanda Maximoff,
your mind is being held hostage

1:18:35.836 --> 1:18:36.920
by your alternate self.

1:18:40.632 --> 1:18:41.758
Grab my hand.

1:18:42.634 --> 1:18:45.011
Perhaps, if I can pull you
from under the rubble,

1:18:45.429 --> 1:18:46.680
the spell will break.

1:19:33.310 --> 1:19:35.479
-Hey! You all right?

1:19:36.938 --> 1:19:37.939
You okay?

1:19:39.399 --> 1:19:40.400
Hey.

1:19:41.943 --> 1:19:43.695
-You all right?
-- Yeah.

1:19:45.447 --> 1:19:46.448
Hey.

1:19:47.949 --> 1:19:49.367
She fixed him.

1:19:49.451 --> 1:19:50.744
-- Thank you.
-Yeah.

1:19:50.827 --> 1:19:52.871
Xavier said I built a waypoint
to The Book of Vishanti.

1:19:52.954 --> 1:19:53.997
Can you take us there?

1:19:54.080 --> 1:19:55.081
How am I supposed to trust you?

1:19:55.165 --> 1:19:57.292
I know what happened,
and I'm sorry for what he did,

1:19:57.375 --> 1:19:59.544
but believe me,
The Book of Vishanti is the only way.

1:19:59.628 --> 1:20:00.754
- Yeah. Your way.

1:20:00.837 --> 1:20:03.131
You sound a lot
like my Stephen right now.

1:20:03.215 --> 1:20:04.633
He had to be the one holding the knife,

1:20:04.716 --> 1:20:07.010
and then that knife
killed a trillion people.

1:20:07.093 --> 1:20:08.762
- This Stephen is different.

1:20:09.596 --> 1:20:10.597
He is.

1:20:10.764 --> 1:20:12.557
It doesn't matter
about all the other Stephens.

1:20:13.934 --> 1:20:15.310
You're not like them.

1:20:19.272 --> 1:20:20.398
Smart kid.

1:20:24.945 --> 1:20:25.946
Give me your hand.

1:20:29.741 --> 1:20:32.410
Do not make me regret this.

1:20:32.577 --> 1:20:33.662
I won't.

1:20:35.121 --> 1:20:36.873
-Okay, can we go now?
-Yeah, follow me.

1:20:51.471 --> 1:20:52.472
Where's that tunnel go?

1:20:52.764 --> 1:20:54.182
Under the river.

1:21:01.982 --> 1:21:03.358
Go, go, go, go, go!

1:22:07.797 --> 1:22:09.799
Where did she go?

1:22:20.810 --> 1:22:22.020
I warned you.

1:22:23.021 --> 1:22:25.315
Other Wanda, if you're in there,

1:22:25.482 --> 1:22:26.524
hold your breath.

1:22:36.159 --> 1:22:38.203
-Did you kill her?
-No, just bought us some time.

1:22:40.330 --> 1:22:41.623
The Book's through here.

1:22:41.706 --> 1:22:42.958
But only Stephen's ever opened it.

1:22:53.343 --> 1:22:54.511
Shit.

1:22:55.470 --> 1:22:56.972
An enchantment
that's specific to me,

1:22:57.055 --> 1:22:58.056
something only I would know.

1:22:58.139 --> 1:22:59.891
-Wait. Stephen.
-- Come on.

1:23:00.392 --> 1:23:02.644
Come on.

1:23:02.811 --> 1:23:04.312
Stephen.

1:23:12.696 --> 1:23:13.697
Yeah.

1:23:16.658 --> 1:23:17.659
Thank you.

1:23:18.284 --> 1:23:19.744
Sure.

1:23:25.208 --> 1:23:26.543
- Open sesame.

1:23:59.200 --> 1:24:00.201
Come on, kid.

1:24:00.827 --> 1:24:02.037
You got this.

1:24:03.788 --> 1:24:05.081
We got this.

1:24:07.459 --> 1:24:08.543
Yeah.

1:24:16.551 --> 1:24:17.552
You all right?

1:24:17.719 --> 1:24:18.845
Yeah.

1:24:21.222 --> 1:24:24.434
This is the Gap Junction,
the space between universes.

1:24:37.655 --> 1:24:39.115
All right, Book.

1:24:42.410 --> 1:24:43.787
Give me what I need.

1:25:02.305 --> 1:25:03.306
-No!

1:25:56.860 --> 1:25:58.153
My boys.

1:26:09.873 --> 1:26:11.374
This isn't what your children would want.

1:26:27.515 --> 1:26:28.933
They'll never know.

1:26:29.100 --> 1:26:30.185
Maybe not.

1:26:30.768 --> 1:26:31.769
But you will.

1:26:35.732 --> 1:26:36.983
-Oh, no.

1:26:37.150 --> 1:26:38.484
Oh, crap.

1:26:40.195 --> 1:26:42.989
- It's like this reality
collapsed in on itself.

1:26:43.072 --> 1:26:44.115
- Yeah.

1:26:44.616 --> 1:26:47.368
-Or two realities collided.

1:26:47.452 --> 1:26:48.620
Come on.

1:26:49.078 --> 1:26:50.788
America doesn't have long.

1:26:51.206 --> 1:26:52.582
- So where are we going?

1:26:52.665 --> 1:26:54.834
- Well,
if there's still a sanctum

1:26:54.918 --> 1:26:55.960
in this universe,

1:26:57.086 --> 1:27:00.632
then there might be
another Other Other Me,

1:27:00.798 --> 1:27:03.301
and that's our best shot
of getting back to her.

1:27:15.772 --> 1:27:19.108
Well, I can see why you guys
were so worried about Incursions.

1:27:21.236 --> 1:27:22.654
- Whatever happened,

1:27:23.738 --> 1:27:25.907
this universe's you
didn't do a very good job

1:27:25.990 --> 1:27:27.200
of stopping it.

1:27:37.627 --> 1:27:39.462
I'll tell him you said that.

1:28:39.856 --> 1:28:40.982
Hello?

1:28:48.823 --> 1:28:50.074
- Stop where you are.

1:28:52.452 --> 1:28:54.495
How did you get here?

1:28:55.413 --> 1:28:56.581
By accident.

1:28:58.583 --> 1:28:59.584
Who are you?

1:29:00.626 --> 1:29:01.627
What are you?

1:29:01.711 --> 1:29:03.796
I'm just one of us.

1:29:04.047 --> 1:29:05.548
From the Multiverse?

1:29:05.631 --> 1:29:06.841
That's right.

1:29:08.760 --> 1:29:09.761
Prove it.

1:29:13.181 --> 1:29:14.515
We had a sister.

1:29:15.058 --> 1:29:16.059
Donna.

1:29:18.895 --> 1:29:19.937
But she, um...

1:29:21.522 --> 1:29:23.483
She died when we were kids.

1:29:25.610 --> 1:29:26.652
How?

1:29:28.071 --> 1:29:33.826
We were playing
on a frozen lake and, uh...

1:29:37.914 --> 1:29:39.832
she fell through the ice.

1:29:46.130 --> 1:29:47.965
I couldn't save her.

1:29:50.176 --> 1:29:51.844
Sounds about right.

1:29:54.514 --> 1:29:56.974
But we don't talk about that, do we?

1:29:58.309 --> 1:29:59.477
No, we don't.

1:30:01.104 --> 1:30:03.815
Suppose your reality
wasn't always like this.

1:30:03.898 --> 1:30:06.442
- I suspect it was
somewhat like yours until...

1:30:06.526 --> 1:30:07.527
- Until?

1:30:09.487 --> 1:30:10.905
Until I lost.

1:30:12.323 --> 1:30:13.950
To whom?

1:30:17.495 --> 1:30:18.830
What do you want?

1:30:19.580 --> 1:30:22.083
I just want to get home.

1:30:22.291 --> 1:30:23.835
Yeah? Believe me,

1:30:24.001 --> 1:30:26.879
I've been trying to leave
this place for a long time.

1:30:28.047 --> 1:30:29.382
Darkhold.

1:30:29.549 --> 1:30:32.301
You guard the Darkhold in this universe?

1:30:32.468 --> 1:30:33.511
Yeah.

1:30:34.137 --> 1:30:35.179
For good reason.

1:30:35.388 --> 1:30:36.431
That's a start.

1:30:36.514 --> 1:30:37.682
I could use it.

1:30:37.765 --> 1:30:39.642
It could help me to communicate
with my universe.

1:30:39.725 --> 1:30:40.893
Careful.

1:30:41.811 --> 1:30:44.397
The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll.

1:30:44.480 --> 1:30:47.400
I don't mean to be callous,

1:30:47.483 --> 1:30:50.445
but how much of a heavier toll
is there left to exact?

1:30:50.528 --> 1:30:52.780
Not just on its reality.

1:30:53.156 --> 1:30:54.407
On its reader.

1:30:55.491 --> 1:30:57.493
Look, I'm sorry you couldn't
save your universe,

1:30:57.577 --> 1:31:00.121
but maybe you could help
to save mine.

1:31:03.207 --> 1:31:05.084
Are you happy, Stephen?

1:31:06.002 --> 1:31:07.044
What?

1:31:07.670 --> 1:31:12.300
Are you happy, Stephen?

1:31:14.218 --> 1:31:16.554
It's the question that...

1:31:18.055 --> 1:31:19.724
Christine Palmer

1:31:20.433 --> 1:31:22.185
asked me at her wedding.

1:31:25.188 --> 1:31:27.690
I said, "Yes, of course I'm happy.

1:31:27.857 --> 1:31:30.067
"I'm a sorcerer with the power of gods.

1:31:30.151 --> 1:31:32.945
"What man wouldn't be happy?"

1:31:33.696 --> 1:31:38.868
And then I came back
to this goddamn haunted house,

1:31:39.035 --> 1:31:40.453
sat down,

1:31:42.121 --> 1:31:44.332
and wondered why I'd lied.

1:31:46.626 --> 1:31:49.337
I never meant for any of this to happen.

1:31:51.172 --> 1:31:54.175
I was looking for a world
where things were different.

1:31:56.344 --> 1:31:59.847
Where I had Christine,
where I was happy.

1:32:01.974 --> 1:32:03.434
But I didn't find it.

1:32:05.061 --> 1:32:07.230
All I found were more of us.

1:32:09.190 --> 1:32:11.567
So I did those Stephens a favor.

1:32:13.194 --> 1:32:15.947
You ever had that dream
where you're falling

1:32:16.030 --> 1:32:19.742
as if you've been pushed off
a tall building?

1:32:22.787 --> 1:32:24.622
That was probably me.

1:32:33.130 --> 1:32:35.716
The Darkhold exacts a heavy toll.

1:32:35.883 --> 1:32:37.343
Okay.

1:32:38.261 --> 1:32:40.846
All the more reason to give it a rest
and let me have it.

1:32:41.013 --> 1:32:42.431
Here's the deal.

1:32:42.598 --> 1:32:45.393
I'll let you use the Darkhold

1:32:45.476 --> 1:32:47.395
if you give me your Christine.

1:32:48.145 --> 1:32:49.438
Yeah.

1:32:49.605 --> 1:32:51.607
I don't think she's gonna go for that.

1:32:51.774 --> 1:32:52.775
No?

1:32:52.984 --> 1:32:55.236
Didn't think so.

1:36:23.194 --> 1:36:24.487
Hang on, we're coming.

1:36:31.118 --> 1:36:32.870
What are you doing with the Darkhold?

1:36:35.039 --> 1:36:36.957
Are you going to Dreamwalk?

1:36:37.124 --> 1:36:39.376
It's a little bit more
than just Dreamwalking.

1:36:39.543 --> 1:36:41.837
All you Stranges, you're the same.

1:36:42.004 --> 1:36:43.047
I know.

1:36:45.132 --> 1:36:46.217
You're right.

1:36:47.051 --> 1:36:48.385
We are all the same.

1:36:49.428 --> 1:36:50.930
But right now, that kid needs me.

1:36:51.013 --> 1:36:54.683
And I can't do any of this
without your help.

1:36:55.559 --> 1:36:56.644
While I'm under,

1:36:56.727 --> 1:36:58.187
I need you to protect my body

1:36:58.270 --> 1:37:00.272
in case they attack me for trespassing.

1:37:00.606 --> 1:37:01.774
Who's "they"?

1:37:03.484 --> 1:37:05.736
The souls of the damned.

1:37:27.967 --> 1:37:28.968
Okay.

1:37:29.134 --> 1:37:33.138
But doesn't a version of you
need to live in that universe,

1:37:33.305 --> 1:37:35.099
so that you can Dreamwalk into them?

1:37:36.767 --> 1:37:38.561
Who said they had to be living?

1:38:52.426 --> 1:38:54.219
Stephen Strange,

1:38:54.386 --> 1:38:57.097
possessing a dead body is forbidden.

1:38:57.264 --> 1:38:58.891
- Forbidden.

1:38:58.974 --> 1:39:00.476
Trespasser!

1:39:00.559 --> 1:39:02.102
- Trespasser!

1:39:03.520 --> 1:39:07.733
- Cease your Dreamwalk,
or face the eternal consequences.

1:39:16.617 --> 1:39:17.743
- Stephen!

1:39:18.410 --> 1:39:20.245
They're pulling me down.

1:39:21.747 --> 1:39:22.957
- Stephen!

1:39:30.714 --> 1:39:32.216
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

1:39:33.008 --> 1:39:34.009
Where are you?

1:40:00.703 --> 1:40:02.621
The Brazier of Bom'Galiath.

1:40:13.298 --> 1:40:14.299
Go back to hell.

1:40:26.854 --> 1:40:28.063
Stephen.

1:40:29.565 --> 1:40:30.858
I've got you.

1:40:32.067 --> 1:40:34.445
You're a Master of the Mystic Arts.

1:40:34.862 --> 1:40:36.321
They're spirits.

1:40:36.405 --> 1:40:37.448
Use them.

1:40:42.745 --> 1:40:43.746
Use them.

1:40:46.165 --> 1:40:47.166
Use them.

1:41:03.891 --> 1:41:05.184
- No!

1:41:59.113 --> 1:42:00.114
Come on!

1:42:05.786 --> 1:42:06.787
Uh-oh.

1:42:35.023 --> 1:42:37.234
Strange!

1:42:45.659 --> 1:42:47.494
Dreamwalking. You hypocrite!

1:42:54.251 --> 1:42:56.211
This time, it's gonna take
more than killing me

1:42:56.295 --> 1:42:57.546
to kill me.

1:43:05.888 --> 1:43:08.432
- Murderer! Murderer!

1:43:21.153 --> 1:43:22.905
I don't even wanna know.

1:43:36.251 --> 1:43:38.253
-- No!

1:43:38.337 --> 1:43:39.504
-- No!
-- No!

1:43:39.588 --> 1:43:41.381
She's breaking free!

1:43:41.548 --> 1:43:42.883
Hold her!

1:43:43.050 --> 1:43:45.469
Strange, take America's power!

1:43:51.308 --> 1:43:53.018
There's no other way.

1:43:53.977 --> 1:43:54.978
Yeah.

1:43:55.312 --> 1:43:56.772
This is the only way.

1:44:09.868 --> 1:44:12.496
It's me in Other Me's body.

1:44:16.250 --> 1:44:19.253
You're here to take my power,
aren't you?

1:44:20.254 --> 1:44:21.755
Before Wanda can.

1:44:23.674 --> 1:44:24.800
It's okay.

1:44:25.759 --> 1:44:27.135
I understand now.

1:44:31.932 --> 1:44:34.142
No, America.

1:44:34.851 --> 1:44:37.312
I've come here to tell you
to trust yourself.

1:44:37.479 --> 1:44:39.064
Trust your power.

1:44:39.231 --> 1:44:41.233
That's how we stop her.

1:44:41.900 --> 1:44:43.485
I can't control it. I...

1:44:43.568 --> 1:44:45.570
Yes, you can.

1:44:45.737 --> 1:44:47.197
You have been all along.

1:44:48.073 --> 1:44:49.992
Every time you opened a portal,

1:44:50.075 --> 1:44:52.619
you sent us
exactly where we needed to go.

1:44:54.454 --> 1:44:56.081
What about the first time?

1:44:56.248 --> 1:44:58.750
Even that led you to this moment...

1:45:00.752 --> 1:45:03.422
when you're gonna kick that witch's ass.

1:45:25.986 --> 1:45:27.070
I've got you.

1:45:52.137 --> 1:45:53.305
Uh-huh.

1:45:54.556 --> 1:45:55.849
Mm-mm-mm.

1:46:17.120 --> 1:46:18.497
I can't beat you.

1:46:20.540 --> 1:46:22.042
So I'll give you what you want.

1:46:36.348 --> 1:46:38.433
Billy. Tommy.

1:46:38.892 --> 1:46:41.228
Mommy!
It's the witch!

1:46:41.311 --> 1:46:42.854
What have you done?

1:46:43.105 --> 1:46:44.106
-Mom!
-Mommy!

1:46:44.189 --> 1:46:45.399
Wait! Boys!

1:46:45.482 --> 1:46:46.900
It's okay, it's okay. It's okay.

1:46:47.067 --> 1:46:48.193
I'm your mother!

1:46:50.612 --> 1:46:52.197
Get away from them.

1:46:53.073 --> 1:46:54.741
-- Mom!

1:46:55.200 --> 1:46:56.451
- No.

1:46:56.535 --> 1:46:57.577
Not yet.

1:46:58.078 --> 1:46:59.287
- Mommy!

1:46:59.371 --> 1:47:01.206
-- Get away from our mom!
-You're not our real mom!

1:47:01.289 --> 1:47:03.041
Hey, boys. Stop. Please.

1:47:03.125 --> 1:47:04.918
-Please. Boys, stop it.
-- Get out of our house!

1:47:05.001 --> 1:47:06.586
-- You're not our mom!
-- Get out!

1:47:06.753 --> 1:47:07.963
-- Go away!
-- Go!

1:47:08.046 --> 1:47:09.423
Stop it!

1:47:17.722 --> 1:47:19.766
Please don't hurt us.

1:47:20.142 --> 1:47:21.184
Please.

1:47:22.144 --> 1:47:23.937
I would never hurt you.

1:47:24.104 --> 1:47:25.105
Never.

1:47:26.857 --> 1:47:29.067
I would never hurt anyone.

1:47:29.234 --> 1:47:30.902
I'm not a monster.

1:47:31.069 --> 1:47:32.320
I'm a...

1:47:36.199 --> 1:47:37.242
I'm...

1:47:44.166 --> 1:47:46.376
I'm sorry.

1:47:54.426 --> 1:47:55.510
Mom!

1:47:55.677 --> 1:47:57.304
-Are you okay?
-- Hi.

1:47:58.263 --> 1:47:59.598
Hi. Okay.

1:47:59.764 --> 1:48:00.765
I'm okay.

1:48:01.641 --> 1:48:04.269
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1:48:15.989 --> 1:48:17.949
-Mom, don't go. Don't go.
-No, Mom. Don't.

1:48:18.033 --> 1:48:19.159
-It's okay.
-Mom.

1:48:19.242 --> 1:48:21.036
It's okay. It's okay.

1:49:01.993 --> 1:49:04.204
Know that they'll be loved.

1:49:45.161 --> 1:49:46.162
What now?

1:49:46.329 --> 1:49:47.664
Get out of here.

1:49:48.415 --> 1:49:49.457
I'll find you.

1:49:58.383 --> 1:50:00.135
We have to go. Now!

1:50:12.606 --> 1:50:14.441
I opened the Darkhold.

1:50:15.275 --> 1:50:17.444
I have to close it.

1:50:20.238 --> 1:50:23.241
No one will ever be tempted
by the Darkhold again.

1:51:07.994 --> 1:51:09.537
You all right?

1:51:10.205 --> 1:51:11.831
-Is it over?
-Yeah.

1:51:12.415 --> 1:51:13.750
Is America okay?

1:51:13.833 --> 1:51:15.752
She's on her way here to get us.

1:51:18.213 --> 1:51:19.214
Wanda?

1:51:21.007 --> 1:51:22.008
No.

1:51:30.433 --> 1:51:33.853
So she destroyed the Darkhold
in every universe.

1:51:36.815 --> 1:51:38.400
She did the right thing.

1:51:40.360 --> 1:51:41.361
Yeah, she did.

1:51:49.327 --> 1:51:51.204
What's your universe like?

1:51:53.248 --> 1:51:55.458
-It's very beautiful.
-Hmm.

1:51:59.754 --> 1:52:01.423
I wish I could show you.

1:52:05.510 --> 1:52:06.845
I'd really like that.

1:52:11.933 --> 1:52:14.436
-But I have to go.
-Yeah.

1:52:15.645 --> 1:52:16.896
Yeah, I know.

1:52:20.650 --> 1:52:22.110
It's too bad, though.

1:52:24.362 --> 1:52:26.322
Could've been one hell of an Incursion.

1:52:29.993 --> 1:52:31.202
I love you.

1:52:34.289 --> 1:52:37.000
I love you in every universe.

1:52:41.045 --> 1:52:42.797
It's not that
I don't wanna care for someone

1:52:42.881 --> 1:52:44.340
or have someone care for me.

1:52:44.507 --> 1:52:45.717
It's just...

1:52:49.053 --> 1:52:50.430
I get scared.

1:52:50.597 --> 1:52:51.598
Yeah.

1:52:54.684 --> 1:52:56.102
Yeah.

1:53:07.197 --> 1:53:08.406
Face your fears...

1:53:11.159 --> 1:53:13.077
Doctor Strange.

1:53:43.024 --> 1:53:45.151
Ay! How is this so much harder

1:53:45.235 --> 1:53:46.778
than a Multiversal portal?

1:53:48.947 --> 1:53:51.282
She needs to slow down
and be more patient.

1:53:53.034 --> 1:53:55.119
Reminds me of another student I knew.

1:53:57.622 --> 1:53:58.957
How you feeling?

1:53:59.582 --> 1:54:00.583
Why do you ask?

1:54:02.460 --> 1:54:05.505
You used the Darkhold
to Dreamwalk into your own corpse.

1:54:05.588 --> 1:54:06.756
Oh.

1:54:06.840 --> 1:54:08.174
Yeah, right, that.

1:54:09.175 --> 1:54:10.176
Fine.

1:54:12.512 --> 1:54:14.305
But I do wanna ask you something.

1:54:15.765 --> 1:54:17.225
Are you happy?

1:54:18.643 --> 1:54:20.395
That's a, um,

1:54:20.478 --> 1:54:21.688
interesting question.

1:54:23.356 --> 1:54:26.109
You'd think that saving the world
would get you there,

1:54:26.776 --> 1:54:27.986
but it doesn't.

1:54:31.364 --> 1:54:35.451
Sometimes, I do wonder
about my other lives.

1:54:36.828 --> 1:54:39.289
Yet I remain grateful in this one.

1:54:40.290 --> 1:54:42.083
Even with its tribulations.

1:54:44.085 --> 1:54:46.754
At least we don't have to
go through it alone, huh?

1:54:46.921 --> 1:54:48.006
No, we don't.

1:54:55.471 --> 1:54:56.514
Hmm.

1:54:59.267 --> 1:55:01.144
-Wait.

1:55:03.479 --> 1:55:04.522
'Sup?

1:55:04.689 --> 1:55:05.690
'Sup.

1:55:07.317 --> 1:55:08.318
Made some sparks.

1:55:08.943 --> 1:55:09.944
Great.

1:55:10.570 --> 1:55:12.071
Your parents would be proud.

1:55:12.155 --> 1:55:14.240
I hope you'll get to show 'em one day.

1:55:15.366 --> 1:55:16.409
Stephen.

1:55:21.039 --> 1:55:23.333
I'm glad I fell into your universe.

1:55:25.293 --> 1:55:26.586
So am I, kid.

1:55:28.254 --> 1:55:29.964
So am I.

1:56:05.083 --> 1:56:06.084
Hmm.

1:58:55.670 --> 1:58:57.004
- Doctor Strange?

1:59:00.424 --> 1:59:01.592
Can I help you?

1:59:02.260 --> 1:59:03.719
You caused an Incursion,

1:59:03.886 --> 1:59:05.513
and we're gonna fix it.

1:59:14.188 --> 1:59:15.648
Unless you're afraid.

1:59:20.528 --> 1:59:21.821
Not in the least.

1:59:26.909 --> 1:59:28.911


2:06:13.357 --> 2:06:14.567
It's over!
