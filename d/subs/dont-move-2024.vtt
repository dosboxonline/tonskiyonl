06:11.041 --> 06:12.208
Beautiful day.

06:16.500 --> 06:19.666
I heard it was an amazing view, but... wow.

06:25.208 --> 06:26.291
Don't mind me.

06:27.083 --> 06:28.458
Be on my way in a minute.

06:44.583 --> 06:47.333
I saw the memorial back there.

06:48.833 --> 06:50.958
- Is that--
- I'm not talking about it.

06:53.041 --> 06:53.875
Okay.

06:58.708 --> 06:59.541
I'm Richard.

07:01.916 --> 07:02.750
And you?

07:09.833 --> 07:12.083
Look, you're really making me nervous.

07:12.083 --> 07:14.916
If you're not gonna step back,
why don't you at least tell me your name?

07:22.041 --> 07:23.708
I know you want to be alone.

07:24.375 --> 07:25.375
I wanted to be alone too.

07:25.375 --> 07:28.125
Why do you think I'm out here
before the bears are even awake?

07:31.708 --> 07:33.000
Look, I...

07:33.583 --> 07:36.125
I don't need you
to tell me your life story.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.833
I don't need you to hurt
any less than you already do.

07:41.875 --> 07:44.750
I just want you to put a little space
between yourself and the--

07:44.750 --> 07:46.458
You're not gonna stop me.

07:57.000 --> 07:58.375
I used to be a car guy,

07:59.208 --> 08:01.041
even when I couldn't afford it.

08:01.625 --> 08:04.875
Back in grad school,
I had this beautiful little Integra

08:05.708 --> 08:07.500
and, man, I babied that thing.

08:08.666 --> 08:10.666
"Where's this headed?" she thinks.

08:11.291 --> 08:13.791
It's headed straight into a brick wall.

08:13.791 --> 08:17.125
Week before graduation,
totaled the Integra.

08:19.833 --> 08:23.541
Worst part was Chloe and I
were arguing just before the crash.

08:28.541 --> 08:31.458
I don't wanna tell you
what my last words to her were.

08:34.416 --> 08:35.250
I'm sorry.

08:36.333 --> 08:37.958
That's what everyone says.

08:40.500 --> 08:41.916
They had me in traction.

08:42.666 --> 08:47.000
Couldn't move for two months,
two weeks, and four days.

08:48.250 --> 08:51.916
Trapped in a hospital bed
when all I wanted to do was

08:53.125 --> 08:55.625
run as far away from myself
as I could get.

08:57.791 --> 09:02.125
And all that time, anyone who came
to visit, all they could say to me was...

09:03.916 --> 09:04.958
I'm sorry.

09:06.208 --> 09:07.625
I'm sorry.

09:08.625 --> 09:11.875
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Like, don't you know any other words?

09:11.875 --> 09:14.250
Ugh, I just don't bother saying anything.

09:14.250 --> 09:17.375
Right. Just leave the casserole
and get the hell out of my house.

09:30.291 --> 09:34.041
My husband was carving
our initials in the tree.

09:37.250 --> 09:40.541
My son was looking for sticks
so he could roast marshmallows.

09:41.916 --> 09:45.750
He said he could find all three in under
a minute, and I bet him he couldn't.

09:49.041 --> 09:51.541
And I just went on gathering wildflowers.

09:56.666 --> 09:58.666
We didn't even hear him when he...

10:08.875 --> 10:10.666
The world takes what it wants.

10:15.833 --> 10:18.041
I wish
it would've taken me instead.

10:22.500 --> 10:25.291
Oh God.
The part I hate the most is that I...

10:27.916 --> 10:29.541
I haven't been able to cry.

10:31.958 --> 10:33.666
I want to, but I...

10:36.375 --> 10:37.458
I'm broken.

10:41.916 --> 10:43.666
Broken doesn't have to mean...

10:45.375 --> 10:46.208
hopeless.

10:54.875 --> 10:55.750
Well...

10:56.541 --> 10:59.333
...it wasn't exactly a pleasure,

10:59.333 --> 11:01.833
but it was nice to meet you.

11:04.583 --> 11:05.416
Iris.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.458
I'm not gonna try to change
what you do next, Iris.

11:11.583 --> 11:12.583
But like I said...

11:15.375 --> 11:17.208
...it really is a beautiful day.

12:40.416 --> 12:42.291
I'm not such a car guy anymore [chuckles].

12:45.083 --> 12:46.958
Well, Richard, um...

12:49.666 --> 12:51.083
I guess this is goodbye.

12:53.291 --> 12:55.875
You're not gonna wait for me
to drive away so you can go back there?

12:58.333 --> 12:59.333
Not today.

13:01.750 --> 13:02.791
I'll take today.

13:27.666 --> 13:29.208
Looks like I blocked you in.

13:29.208 --> 13:30.958
Looks like.

13:32.833 --> 13:33.750
Sorry.

13:39.666 --> 13:40.750
Expecting rain?

13:41.750 --> 13:43.875
You can never be too prepared, you know?

13:45.708 --> 13:47.916
Uh, it's okay. I can, um, go around.

13:48.958 --> 13:50.041
Of course.

13:50.916 --> 13:53.458
- Richard.
- Why do you keep calling me that?

16:22.541 --> 16:25.500
Please, go through the process.
Everybody does.

16:27.583 --> 16:29.166
But there is no red dot.

16:29.166 --> 16:33.375
And that means no cellular.
And that means no emergency SOS.

16:37.708 --> 16:39.625
Too bad your phone isn't nearby.

16:40.791 --> 16:44.208
If only there was
a trusted Wi-Fi connection.

16:46.083 --> 16:48.083
My husband will be looking for me.

16:49.291 --> 16:51.041
I'd certainly hope so.

16:53.875 --> 16:55.125
Please don't do this.

16:55.125 --> 16:58.500
"Please don't do this.
Don't hurt me. I have children."

16:59.041 --> 17:01.791
What can I say, Iris?
Wrong place, right time.

17:02.291 --> 17:04.791
Oh, that reminds me.
Brought you something.

17:34.916 --> 17:36.208
Tell me about Chloe.

17:36.708 --> 17:38.083
Tell me about your boy.

17:38.750 --> 17:39.833
What was his name?

17:42.750 --> 17:43.791
It's Mateo.

17:45.875 --> 17:46.708
Why not Matthew?

17:47.291 --> 17:49.375
Why not Charlie? It's a name.

17:49.958 --> 17:50.833
Fair.

17:52.708 --> 17:55.375
And Chloe, was she pretty?

17:56.166 --> 17:57.000
Very.

17:58.375 --> 17:59.625
You remind me of her.

18:01.500 --> 18:02.708
How did you meet?

18:02.708 --> 18:04.833
I know what you're doing.

18:05.875 --> 18:07.791
Trying to soften me up.

18:09.208 --> 18:10.458
You're not the first.

18:11.750 --> 18:14.125
I just want us to be on the level. Okay?

18:15.541 --> 18:18.375
Like you were on the level
with me earlier?

18:18.875 --> 18:22.333
I may have deceived you,
but I speak my truth.

18:24.250 --> 18:25.500
Okay, Richard.

18:26.666 --> 18:28.000
Speak your truth.

18:29.458 --> 18:31.333
I have a small place out in the woods.

18:31.916 --> 18:34.125
What are you gonna do to me
when we get there?

18:36.666 --> 18:38.250
I wanna braid your hair.

18:38.916 --> 18:40.250
The fuck you are.

19:41.250 --> 19:42.916
Stop! Stop!

20:18.541 --> 20:21.041
- Help!
- It couldn't have been more perfect.

20:22.541 --> 20:26.666
The setting, the isolation, the timing.

20:26.666 --> 20:28.250
Stay the fuck away from me.

20:28.250 --> 20:30.791
And I go and mess it up
by not checking your pockets.

20:30.791 --> 20:32.250
I said stay away.

20:32.750 --> 20:35.166
- Help!
- It must be something about you.

20:35.666 --> 20:38.291
Then again,
there must be something about me.

20:38.958 --> 20:41.125
Half an hour ago,
you were ready to end it all.

20:41.125 --> 20:42.958
- Now look at you.
- Fuck you.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.333
Have you started to feel it yet?

20:47.000 --> 20:47.916
Feel what?

20:47.916 --> 20:50.541
Might be hard to tell at this point
given what we've been through.

20:50.541 --> 20:53.458
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- System redundancy.

20:54.291 --> 20:57.583
Like on an airplane, everything has
a backup, even the toilet flushers.

20:57.583 --> 21:00.708
But when you're flying at 40,000 feet,
you can never be too prepared.

21:05.416 --> 21:06.333
What is that?

21:06.916 --> 21:09.000
We're flying at 40,000 feet, Iris.

21:11.791 --> 21:13.000
What did you do to me?

21:13.500 --> 21:15.916
Your body is going to shut down soon.

21:16.916 --> 21:18.041
You poisoned me?

21:18.041 --> 21:19.208
Not poisoned.

21:19.208 --> 21:22.291
Just a special relaxant
to make things easier on both of us.

21:23.000 --> 21:24.416
You're crazy.

21:25.083 --> 21:26.291
I'd be crazy not to.

21:27.083 --> 21:29.166
- Help!
- You keep saying that.

21:30.083 --> 21:32.041
Once it kicks in,
you have about 20 minutes

21:32.041 --> 21:33.583
before you're completely paralyzed.

21:34.166 --> 21:37.166
At minute one,
your fine motor skills will start to go.

21:37.750 --> 21:41.041
Dialing a phone,
holding a knife, that kind of thing.

21:41.875 --> 21:44.500
At minute ten,
your legs will begin tingling.

21:44.500 --> 21:46.291
That means
your gross motor skills are next.

21:46.291 --> 21:49.041
Minute 15,
your legs will give out altogether.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.083
Eighteen, your breathing
will become labored.

21:51.083 --> 21:53.791
And just before everything
shuts down on you,

21:54.666 --> 21:55.583
your voice.

22:00.083 --> 22:00.916
Shall we?

22:08.166 --> 22:10.916
Running is only gonna make it work faster.

22:11.833 --> 22:12.666
Shit.

22:32.750 --> 22:35.583
Have your fingers started to go?

22:55.791 --> 22:56.625
Fuck.

23:02.916 --> 23:05.041
One, two, three, four.

23:06.041 --> 23:07.666
One, two--

23:08.166 --> 23:10.875
<i>One, two...</i>

23:10.875 --> 23:13.666
...three, four.

23:14.166 --> 23:15.000
Really good.

23:18.291 --> 23:19.291
<i>One...</i>

23:19.916 --> 23:21.041
Two.

23:22.125 --> 23:24.166
<i>Lasts about an hour.</i>

23:25.333 --> 23:27.666
Then we'll have
the whole weekend together.

23:51.166 --> 23:53.958
One, two, three...

23:58.958 --> 23:59.791
Fuck.

24:00.583 --> 24:02.416
Okay, 20 minutes.

24:07.916 --> 24:08.750
Okay.

24:26.791 --> 24:28.541
Oh, no. Come on.

24:29.333 --> 24:30.250
Come on.

25:18.833 --> 25:21.375
Three minutes. Three minutes.

26:50.791 --> 26:53.500
Hope you found a good hiding place!

28:18.375 --> 28:19.916
You won't be able to swim.

33:03.583 --> 33:04.416
You okay?

33:10.208 --> 33:11.041
Miss.

33:11.791 --> 33:13.041
Can you hear me?

33:22.000 --> 33:22.833
How did you...?

33:24.666 --> 33:26.875
How did you get all the way out here? You...

33:27.541 --> 33:29.791
You fall out of a kayak or something?

33:35.625 --> 33:36.750
Can you talk?

33:39.083 --> 33:40.083
Hell...

33:42.000 --> 33:43.541
I'm gonna roll you over.

33:44.041 --> 33:45.041
Okay?

33:46.458 --> 33:47.500
Hang on.

34:01.041 --> 34:01.875
Hm.

34:01.875 --> 34:04.125
So, you can see me.

34:07.958 --> 34:09.500
Wait, do that again.

34:12.916 --> 34:15.250
So, you can hear me.

34:18.083 --> 34:18.916
Okay.

34:20.416 --> 34:22.666
Are... are you able to move at all?

34:24.916 --> 34:25.750
No.

34:26.250 --> 34:29.125
You can see. You can hear.

34:29.958 --> 34:33.000
You can't move.
You can't talk. Am I right?

34:36.708 --> 34:38.166
Are you hurt?

34:45.125 --> 34:46.000
That's good.

34:49.750 --> 34:52.500
I'm gonna take you inside, call 911, okay?

34:54.541 --> 34:57.666
Sit tight.
My knees ain't what they used to be.

36:09.250 --> 36:12.541
Didn't have this on today's bingo card,
that's for sure.

36:28.375 --> 36:31.333
Oh, thank God. Thank God. I...

36:32.041 --> 36:34.166
I was in a car accident.
I can't find my wife. I don't--

36:34.166 --> 36:35.791
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down there.

36:35.791 --> 36:37.500
Take a breath.

36:38.916 --> 36:42.208
It just happened so fast.
She was acting normal and then she just--

36:45.500 --> 36:48.291
Have you seen her?
She's... She's... five-six. She's pretty.

36:51.125 --> 36:52.125
Uh, I'm bleeding.

36:53.041 --> 36:54.083
Sit tight.

36:54.583 --> 36:55.958
I'll get you some help.

37:11.791 --> 37:12.625
Hey.

37:13.375 --> 37:15.166
I asked you to stay put.

37:15.166 --> 37:17.750
I'm sorry. I don't feel well.

37:19.625 --> 37:20.625
You mind?

37:22.250 --> 37:23.791
I'm confused, okay? I...

37:23.791 --> 37:25.750
I don't even remember how I got here.

37:34.083 --> 37:36.333
Listen, man, I'll help you,

37:37.083 --> 37:38.958
but I'm gonna help you on my terms,

37:38.958 --> 37:41.083
and those terms are
we take this back outside.

37:41.083 --> 37:43.916
Can I use your phone?
I lost mine in the accident.

37:43.916 --> 37:45.541
Come on. I'll help you up.

37:45.541 --> 37:47.833
I ju--

37:47.833 --> 37:50.000
I just need to rest for one second.

37:50.000 --> 37:53.583
I can call 911,
ask for help finding your wife.

37:54.083 --> 37:57.625
Or I can call 911 and tell 'em
I have an intruder in my home.

38:11.875 --> 38:12.750
Uh...

38:13.458 --> 38:15.291
Oh, come on, man.
You don't need to do that.

38:15.291 --> 38:19.458
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm just so through with everything.

38:19.458 --> 38:21.500
If you wanna call, just call them.

38:22.041 --> 38:23.541
They'll take her away from me,

38:23.541 --> 38:26.375
but there's nothing
I can do about that now, is there?

38:26.958 --> 38:29.625
<i>If you'd like to make a call,
please hang up and try--</i>

38:37.291 --> 38:38.208
What's your name?

38:39.958 --> 38:41.416
Andrew [sniffs].

38:48.875 --> 38:49.875
Okay, Andrew.

38:52.125 --> 38:54.041
- Talk.
- Oh, thank you.

38:54.916 --> 38:57.333
She's always struggled
with her mental health, but it just...

38:57.333 --> 38:59.375
it's gotten so much worse lately.

38:59.958 --> 39:03.458
Just... accusing me of terrible things.

39:04.166 --> 39:05.250
Untrue things.

39:05.250 --> 39:08.916
We bring the cops in, there's no way
I'll be able to hide it from her family.

39:08.916 --> 39:10.500
They'll have her committed again.

39:12.458 --> 39:15.750
She's my wife, you know?
I... I can't lose her.

39:21.708 --> 39:23.750
And here I've literally lost her.

39:24.916 --> 39:25.958
What's her name?

39:31.250 --> 39:32.166
Chloe.

39:35.500 --> 39:37.500
I shouldn't have let her drive
in the first place,

39:38.000 --> 39:40.291
but her independence
is so important to her.

39:40.791 --> 39:41.833
We were arguing.

39:42.500 --> 39:45.958
You know, the roads here are hard enough
to navigate when you're not distracted.

39:47.500 --> 39:49.250
She hates when I yell, but...

39:50.166 --> 39:52.541
she said she was leaving me,
and I just got so...

39:55.333 --> 39:56.333
scared.

39:57.416 --> 40:01.208
I did. I yelled at her,
and... and... she floored it, and... and...

40:02.833 --> 40:04.666
That's the last thing I remember.

40:05.875 --> 40:07.791
When I came to, she was just gone.

40:08.958 --> 40:13.583
I don't know if she's disoriented
or about to have another episode.

40:15.750 --> 40:18.583
See, when she's really bad,
she goes catatonic.

40:20.416 --> 40:21.458
Catatonic?

40:21.458 --> 40:22.666
She locks up.

40:23.166 --> 40:25.291
Refuses to move, refuses to talk.

40:26.708 --> 40:29.166
That sounds complicated.

40:31.833 --> 40:33.333
Do you have someone in your life?

40:35.791 --> 40:37.166
I don't talk about it.

40:38.541 --> 40:41.583
Neither do I.
I think that's always been my problem.

40:48.041 --> 40:49.791
She had a heart attack.

40:51.125 --> 40:55.166
All those years,
she hounded me about what I ate,

40:55.166 --> 40:56.583
how much I sat,

40:57.875 --> 41:03.375
how I let my anger lead,
and I solved problems with my fists.

41:06.083 --> 41:07.291
And all the while, she--

41:07.833 --> 41:12.250
We were so focused on me,
we forgot to pay any attention to her.

41:16.333 --> 41:18.166
The world takes what it wants.

41:21.500 --> 41:22.583
Hm.

41:27.250 --> 41:28.458
You love your wife?

41:30.500 --> 41:31.666
More than you know.

41:31.666 --> 41:33.458
Are you just gonna accept this?

41:33.458 --> 41:35.791
You're just gonna
let them take her away from you?

41:38.416 --> 41:40.500
- I don't think I am.
- Good.

41:43.958 --> 41:45.958
I haven't been straight with you.

41:48.166 --> 41:49.000
No?

41:51.083 --> 41:51.916
In what way?

42:04.000 --> 42:05.083
You were saying?

42:05.083 --> 42:06.875
You said you lost your phone.

42:07.541 --> 42:08.375
Did I?

42:09.458 --> 42:10.291
In the wreck.

42:10.833 --> 42:11.958
Uh.

42:11.958 --> 42:13.583
I'm still a bit out of it.

42:16.750 --> 42:17.625
Well...

42:19.875 --> 42:21.666
Those woods are a big place.

42:22.291 --> 42:23.291
Better get to looking.

42:23.291 --> 42:25.416
No, no, no. What did you have to tell me?

42:28.333 --> 42:29.166
Nothing.

42:32.791 --> 42:34.166
Tell me something, William.

42:34.708 --> 42:35.958
How do you know my name?

42:35.958 --> 42:37.416
I read it on your mail.

42:38.958 --> 42:41.291
Do you always do heavy gardening
in the kitchen?

42:50.416 --> 42:51.416
Where is she?

42:53.583 --> 42:54.750
Sorry, I...

42:57.500 --> 42:58.875
would've told you sooner.

42:59.375 --> 43:01.125
I just didn't know what the hell to do.

43:02.166 --> 43:03.250
Where?

43:03.833 --> 43:06.750
I would like the two of you
to leave now.

43:07.458 --> 43:10.000
I'll forget any of this ever happened.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.125
Tell me.

43:12.583 --> 43:13.500
In the shed.

43:13.500 --> 43:14.500
Out back.

43:15.958 --> 43:18.083
Took a wheelbarrow out to make room.

43:18.083 --> 43:20.125
Saw you walking up and...

43:21.000 --> 43:23.416
just plumb
brought the damn thing in with me.

43:23.416 --> 43:24.500
Bullshit.

43:25.250 --> 43:26.250
It's the truth.

43:27.541 --> 43:29.833
Well, we can find that out
pretty easily, can't we?

43:29.833 --> 43:30.916
Take a look.

43:30.916 --> 43:32.500
Give me the phone first.

43:35.083 --> 43:36.000
Sure thing.

43:49.625 --> 43:51.083
They'll never get here in time.

43:51.083 --> 43:53.875
You think I'm afraid of you?

43:53.875 --> 43:57.250
You are monopolizing
an already pretty busy fucking day,

43:57.250 --> 43:58.166
you know that?

43:58.166 --> 44:02.500
Yeah. There's a man in my house,
and I'm pretty sure he means to hurt me.

44:02.500 --> 44:03.625
I'm not gonna hurt you.

44:04.375 --> 44:05.958
I'm gonna kill you.

44:29.541 --> 44:31.458
Stay down.

44:34.708 --> 44:35.708
Stay down!

44:35.708 --> 44:37.458
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

44:39.166 --> 44:40.916
What would she make of you, Bill?

44:41.500 --> 44:42.458
Your wife.

44:43.125 --> 44:46.208
After all that work she put in taming you,

44:47.375 --> 44:49.750
teaching you
to control your anger.

44:54.666 --> 44:56.625
It'd probably give her
another heart attack.

44:56.625 --> 44:57.875
Shut your mouth!

45:48.916 --> 45:51.583
<i>Sir, if you can hear me,
we're sending someone now.</i>

45:51.583 --> 45:54.625
<i>There's a couple of units on the way.
Please hang on.</i>

45:56.208 --> 45:58.083
<i>Sir, if you're there, say something.</i>

45:59.333 --> 46:01.083
<i>Sir, if you're there, say something.</i>

49:40.833 --> 49:42.500
You see what you made me do?

50:13.500 --> 50:15.541
I've never killed a man before.

50:17.375 --> 50:19.916
But there's a first time
for everything, right?

50:48.875 --> 50:49.708
Hello?

50:49.708 --> 50:52.208
<i>Dad, I've been trying to call you
all morning.</i>

50:52.208 --> 50:54.041
Hey, sweetie. How are you?

50:54.041 --> 50:55.916
<i>Got my report card today.</i>

50:55.916 --> 50:57.166
Oh, yeah? How'd you do?

50:58.000 --> 50:59.916
<i>All A's and one B.</i>

50:59.916 --> 51:02.541
Wow. Wow. That is...

51:02.541 --> 51:04.583
That is all amazings

51:04.583 --> 51:06.458
and one berry [laughs].

51:06.458 --> 51:08.708
<i>Mom says we can celebrate
at breakfast tomorrow.</i>

51:08.708 --> 51:11.375
Oh, not tomorrow, honey. I'm, uh...

51:11.375 --> 51:14.041
I don't get back till, uh, Sunday night.

51:14.041 --> 51:17.083
<i>That's okay.
Mom says we're coming up to the cabin.</i>

51:20.250 --> 51:21.083
<i>Dad?</i>

51:22.750 --> 51:24.416
Well, that's wonderful news.

51:25.291 --> 51:27.291
Uh, can you put your mom on the phone?

51:27.291 --> 51:29.375
<i>Okay. Bye!</i>

51:30.208 --> 51:32.000
<i>Hey, sorry about Miss Chatterbox.</i>

51:32.000 --> 51:33.666
You're not coming up, are you?

51:33.666 --> 51:36.666
<i>I know these weekends
are very important to you, but--</i>

51:36.666 --> 51:41.583
No buts, Lizzie. You know if you want me
to be the best version of myself,

51:41.583 --> 51:43.041
I need this time away.

51:43.041 --> 51:46.625
<i>Except these times away
keep happening more and more lately.</i>

51:47.208 --> 51:50.125
<i>Look, Olivia needs a change of scenery,
and I need a co-parent,</i>

51:50.125 --> 51:53.250
<i>so sorry if we have to cut into
your mountain bachelor weekend,</i>

51:53.250 --> 51:54.333
<i>but we're coming up.</i>

51:54.833 --> 51:57.333
You're right.
I'm sorry. I'm being selfish.

51:58.750 --> 52:00.708
Come up! Come up! Uh...

52:00.708 --> 52:04.375
And hey, uh, yeah,
put the... put the camping gear in the car.

52:04.375 --> 52:06.083
We'll... we'll make it a whole thing.

52:06.083 --> 52:08.958
Okay? Gotta celebrate this report card.

52:08.958 --> 52:11.416
<i>Great! Should be there about 10:00.</i>

52:12.125 --> 52:13.750
<i>- Love you.</i>
- Love you too.

52:14.500 --> 52:17.458
See you at 10:00.

57:09.458 --> 57:11.000
What are you doing?

57:12.291 --> 57:14.375
You don't wander off like that.
Do you hear me?

57:14.375 --> 57:16.375
I just wanted to say hello.

57:19.875 --> 57:23.250
Okay, well, just don't...
don't do it again. Okay?

59:58.958 --> 01:00:01.083
Oh.

01:00:08.125 --> 01:00:09.166
Good old Bill.

01:01:26.291 --> 01:01:27.125
Oh!

01:01:28.791 --> 01:01:30.250
Am I happy to see you!

01:01:31.708 --> 01:01:32.625
Mornin'.

01:01:33.541 --> 01:01:37.250
Got a call about this truck.
Someone in need of assistance.

01:01:37.250 --> 01:01:39.125
Must be some kind of mistake.

01:01:39.125 --> 01:01:41.208
Yeah, they did provide the plate number.

01:01:42.791 --> 01:01:44.541
- You mind if I talk to your passenger?
- Uh...

01:01:47.041 --> 01:01:50.500
Sir, I need to ensure she's responsive.

01:01:51.416 --> 01:01:52.916
You and me both [grunts].

01:01:52.916 --> 01:01:54.291
Oh, yeah? How's that?

01:01:55.125 --> 01:01:56.166
My wife is drunk.

01:01:56.666 --> 01:01:58.166
At this time of the morning?

01:01:58.166 --> 01:02:00.708
These days,
it's around the clock.

01:02:00.708 --> 01:02:02.208
You been drinking too?

01:02:02.208 --> 01:02:03.708
I don't touch the stuff.

01:02:04.291 --> 01:02:05.458
Makes you sloppy.

01:02:07.208 --> 01:02:08.250
What's your name?

01:02:08.250 --> 01:02:11.000
Andrew. But you can... you can call me Andy.

01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.791
Andrew. You have ID on you?

01:02:13.791 --> 01:02:14.833
Yeah, of course.

01:02:29.833 --> 01:02:31.333
Well, now this is a problem.

01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:33.375
Sorry?

01:02:34.375 --> 01:02:35.958
Your license is expired.

01:02:35.958 --> 01:02:37.125
Oh yeah.

01:02:37.625 --> 01:02:40.041
I've been meaning to get around to that.

01:02:42.083 --> 01:02:43.583
And who does the truck belong to?

01:02:43.583 --> 01:02:45.375
A buddy of mine, Bill.

01:02:45.375 --> 01:02:49.125
You won't mind if I give Bill a call
after you and I are done talking?

01:02:50.125 --> 01:02:51.083
Of course not.

01:03:09.208 --> 01:03:11.500
So you mind telling me
exactly what happened here?

01:03:13.583 --> 01:03:15.500
I hope you don't have somewhere to be.

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:16.541
I just started my shift.

01:03:18.291 --> 01:03:21.500
You see, Officer, uh, my wife
peeled herself off the floor this morning,

01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.083
took the car for a joyride,

01:03:23.083 --> 01:03:27.750
and it seems she wrapped herself around
a fairly good-sized tree.

01:03:27.750 --> 01:03:29.833
That's what I've been able
to piece together.

01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.791
And she was alone?

01:03:31.791 --> 01:03:33.083
As far as I know.

01:03:33.083 --> 01:03:36.208
She called me, and I'm out here
just trying to clean up her mess.

01:03:36.791 --> 01:03:41.625
See, the call we received said both you
and your wife were at the gas station.

01:03:41.625 --> 01:03:44.833
Well, I thought it important to make sure
she didn't choke on her own vomit

01:03:44.833 --> 01:03:46.000
before I fueled up.

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:49.000
Yeah,
no reason to get smart now.

01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:49.958
I'm sorry.

01:03:49.958 --> 01:03:52.916
It's been a pretty rough week
this morning.

01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:56.541
Any reason you didn't call 911
or a tow truck?

01:03:57.416 --> 01:03:59.041
To avoid conversations
like this.

01:04:01.250 --> 01:04:02.666
You say you weren't in the car.

01:04:02.666 --> 01:04:05.250
- No, sir.
- Then what happened to your face?

01:04:16.458 --> 01:04:18.250
I, uh... I...

01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:22.083
Can't answer the question?

01:04:29.458 --> 01:04:31.375
Maybe she can
clear some of this up for us.

01:04:31.375 --> 01:04:33.958
I wouldn't count on it.

01:04:37.166 --> 01:04:38.000
Ma'am.

01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.333
Miss.

01:04:44.458 --> 01:04:46.333
How long has she been intoxicated?

01:04:46.333 --> 01:04:47.250
Ten months.

01:04:48.541 --> 01:04:53.250
Sir, I need you to explain
exactly what happened here.

01:04:54.625 --> 01:04:55.958
- Sir.
- She left me.

01:04:55.958 --> 01:04:57.541
Excuse me?

01:04:58.041 --> 01:04:59.583
Things have been very bad.

01:05:04.125 --> 01:05:05.875
Since we lost our little boy.

01:05:09.583 --> 01:05:11.583
Our beautiful little Mateo.

01:05:13.208 --> 01:05:14.750
He fell a long way and...

01:05:15.708 --> 01:05:18.083
She wasn't watching him
when she should've been.

01:05:18.875 --> 01:05:22.666
So instead of facing her guilt head on,
she... she... she crawled into a bottle.

01:05:23.833 --> 01:05:26.375
And honestly, I don't know
if she'll ever come out of it.

01:05:28.083 --> 01:05:29.833
So...

01:05:29.833 --> 01:05:32.458
...you want to know why
I didn't call 911, Officer?

01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:35.958
Because no one can save her.

01:05:51.791 --> 01:05:52.708
Hel...

01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:02.833
Ma'am?

01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:06.583
Help...

01:06:08.458 --> 01:06:09.291
me.

01:06:09.791 --> 01:06:12.000
- Officer, she's--
- You mind stepping back for me, please?

01:08:11.333 --> 01:08:12.875
I pulled over to help you.

01:08:12.875 --> 01:08:16.208
And you took the car. You took the car.

01:08:16.208 --> 01:08:18.916
You must have...
You must have... You must have...

01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.708
-  Things aren't...
- You must have killed the cop.

01:08:21.708 --> 01:08:24.708
...going quite as you planned.

01:08:25.208 --> 01:08:26.333
You shouldn't talk.

01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:35.125
Tomorrow's a big day. Family time.

01:08:35.625 --> 01:08:39.208
You're dehydrated.
Your body's doing a lot of work right now.

01:08:40.791 --> 01:08:42.166
Have you ever tried it?

01:08:48.083 --> 01:08:49.125
No.

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:50.166
Of course not.

01:08:50.750 --> 01:08:54.208
Too chickenshit to make yourself helpless.

01:08:54.208 --> 01:08:55.291
I've been there.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.791
Yeah, 'cause when what's-her-face died?

01:09:02.666 --> 01:09:03.500
Chloe.

01:09:08.416 --> 01:09:12.875
You were stuck in bed for two months.

01:09:16.250 --> 01:09:18.291
Is that when you lost your mind?

01:09:25.916 --> 01:09:27.458
I didn't lose my mind.

01:09:29.541 --> 01:09:32.208
I found my clarity.

01:09:34.041 --> 01:09:38.083
All my life, I felt disconnected.

01:09:39.541 --> 01:09:43.708
Until those moments after the crash.

01:09:45.833 --> 01:09:48.750
I can still see the angle of her neck.

01:09:48.750 --> 01:09:52.166
The way the light played off
the glass in her lap.

01:09:53.625 --> 01:09:56.750
And when I saw
that she was breathing her last breath,

01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.291
I finally felt connected.

01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:06.041
I lived that moment again and again
lying in that bed trying to figure out

01:10:06.041 --> 01:10:07.458
if I had felt God.

01:10:07.958 --> 01:10:09.041
And eventually,

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.208
I realized I had.

01:10:18.166 --> 01:10:19.291
And He was me.

01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:26.500
What did you say to her?

01:10:27.708 --> 01:10:31.166
You told me you said something to her.

01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.958
I thought it was before the crash, but...

01:10:36.041 --> 01:10:37.208
it was after.

01:10:37.208 --> 01:10:39.166
While she was dying, wasn't it?

01:10:42.166 --> 01:10:43.166
What did you say?

01:10:49.416 --> 01:10:50.291
"Thank you."

01:11:02.125 --> 01:11:04.000
All amazings and one berry.

01:11:05.583 --> 01:11:06.416
What?

01:11:08.166 --> 01:11:11.458
You must love your family very much.

01:11:13.583 --> 01:11:14.583
Your wife.

01:11:15.708 --> 01:11:18.166
- Your daughter.
- Don't talk about my daughter.

01:11:18.666 --> 01:11:22.083
You know deep down
you can't keep doing this.

01:11:23.083 --> 01:11:26.083
You'll get caught.
You'll... you'll never see her again.

01:11:26.083 --> 01:11:27.083
Stop talking.

01:11:27.583 --> 01:11:30.500
I know what it's like to lose a child.

01:11:31.958 --> 01:11:33.375
You don't have to.

01:11:34.166 --> 01:11:36.625
I don't know your name.
I don't know where you live.

01:11:36.625 --> 01:11:37.583
I said stop.

01:11:37.583 --> 01:11:40.166
You can just leave me
on the side of the road.

01:11:40.166 --> 01:11:41.333
Bullshit.

01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:43.666
It's not that easy.

01:11:44.791 --> 01:11:45.833
It's that easy.

01:11:50.458 --> 01:11:55.458
Broken doesn't have to mean hopeless.

01:11:58.791 --> 01:11:59.750
Remember?

01:12:05.708 --> 01:12:07.333
I'm not fucking broken.

01:12:10.291 --> 01:12:11.625
Change of plans, Iris.

01:13:40.166 --> 01:13:41.083
Last stop.

01:13:43.541 --> 01:13:45.791
It's a shame
we had to skip right to the end.

01:13:47.375 --> 01:13:49.666
We could've had
such a nice weekend together.

01:13:52.416 --> 01:13:54.666
At least you'll have
plenty of company down there.

01:14:24.458 --> 01:14:27.416
As your muscles come back,
they'll be an uncoordinated mess.

01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:30.750
You'll have small bursts
of energy like that,

01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:32.541
but your body won't sustain them.

01:14:40.166 --> 01:14:43.083
Why didn't you just let me do it?

01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:46.625
Do what?

01:14:48.250 --> 01:14:49.250
Kill yourself?

01:14:49.750 --> 01:14:52.250
If all of this was gonna end anyway,

01:14:53.833 --> 01:14:55.083
why did you stop me?

01:14:55.083 --> 01:14:56.791
I didn't stop you.

01:14:58.458 --> 01:14:59.666
You did it yourself.

01:15:00.541 --> 01:15:02.541
All of this would have been over.

01:15:03.958 --> 01:15:04.916
All of it.

01:15:08.250 --> 01:15:09.416
It was fate.

01:15:11.708 --> 01:15:13.125
You were meant for me.

01:15:13.625 --> 01:15:14.458
Bullshit.

01:15:17.791 --> 01:15:19.291
There is no fate.

01:15:19.958 --> 01:15:21.416
There is no God.

01:15:21.958 --> 01:15:23.083
There's just us.

01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:26.500
And that means there's just you.

01:15:27.083 --> 01:15:29.500
A sad little man without a name.

01:15:30.083 --> 01:15:31.000
You're angry.

01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.916
- Of course I'm fucking angry.
- And why is that?

01:15:33.916 --> 01:15:35.750
Because I wanted to die.

01:15:38.291 --> 01:15:39.625
I wanted to die.

01:15:47.708 --> 01:15:48.583
"Wanted."

01:18:41.291 --> 01:18:42.875
Look how far you've come.

01:18:48.916 --> 01:18:50.583
Can you do one thing for me?

01:18:53.750 --> 01:18:55.708
Can you get Mateo's boat?

01:18:59.458 --> 01:19:00.625
It's in my pocket.

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:24.916
It's the other side.

01:19:38.333 --> 01:19:39.666
I'm not sorry.

01:25:05.833 --> 01:25:06.708
Thank you.
