<i>I don't wanna be a product</i>
<i>of my environment.</i>

00:43.570 --> 00:48.974
<i>I want my environment</i>
<i>to be a product of me.</i>

00:52.178 --> 00:54.442
<i>Years ago, we had the Church.</i>

00:54.681 --> 00:59.243
<i>That was only a way</i>
<i>of saying we had each other.</i>

01:00.620 --> 01:03.783
But now, I don't know.
It's a funny thing.

01:03.957 --> 01:06.152
It put hate in your heart.

01:06.493 --> 01:09.724
<i>The Knights of Columbus were</i>
<i>real head-breakers.</i>

01:09.896 --> 01:11.124
<i>True guineas.</i>

01:11.298 --> 01:13.823
<i>They took over their piece of the city.</i>

01:16.269 --> 01:20.399
<i>Twenty years after an Irishman couldn't get</i>
<i>a fucking job...</i>

01:20.573 --> 01:24.703
<i>...we had the presidency.</i>
<i>May he rest in peace.</i>

01:25.345 --> 01:28.178
<i>That's what the niggers don't realize.</i>

01:28.348 --> 01:32.614
<i>If I got one thing</i>
<i>against the black chappies, it's this:</i>

01:32.786 --> 01:34.913
<i>No one gives it to you.</i>

01:35.088 --> 01:36.988
<i>You have to take it.</i>

01:58.445 --> 02:02.211
Vin, don't make me have
to come down here again for this.

02:02.382 --> 02:04.873
Won't happen again, Mr. C.

02:07.053 --> 02:11.319
Carmen's developing
into a fine young lady.

02:11.491 --> 02:13.584
You should be proud.

02:25.972 --> 02:28.964
You get your period yet, Carmen?

02:45.625 --> 02:47.092
You Johnny Sullivan's kid?

02:49.029 --> 02:52.260
- You live with your grandmother?
- Yeah.

02:52.565 --> 02:56.797
Vin, get him a couple loaves of bread,
couple half-gallons of milk.

02:56.970 --> 02:59.530
Do you like bologna and cheese?
Give him some cold cuts.

02:59.706 --> 03:04.268
Throw some mayo in.
You like comic books?

03:06.613 --> 03:08.137
You do good in school?

03:09.349 --> 03:13.285
- Yeah.
- That's good. I did too.

03:13.453 --> 03:16.047
They call that a paradox.

03:17.390 --> 03:21.156
Just keep it. Buy yourself some makeup.

03:24.898 --> 03:30.928
You ever wanna earn a little extra money,
you come by L Street.

03:31.104 --> 03:33.800
You know where I am on L Street?

03:33.973 --> 03:35.600
Good.

03:35.775 --> 03:38.300
- Good boy.
- Thanks.

03:40.513 --> 03:44.244
To you, O Lord, we commend the soul
of Alphonsus, your servant.

03:44.417 --> 03:46.408
In the sight of this world,
he is now dead.

03:46.586 --> 03:49.714
Forgive whatever sins he committed
through human weakness.

03:49.889 --> 03:52.187
- Amen.
<i>- The Church wants you in your place.</i>

03:52.358 --> 03:54.918
Kneel, stand, kneel, stand.

03:55.095 --> 03:58.587
If you go for that sort of thing,
I don't know what to do for you.

03:58.765 --> 04:00.926
A man makes his own way.

04:01.101 --> 04:02.693
No one gives it to you.

04:02.869 --> 04:04.734
You have to take it.

04:06.739 --> 04:09.173
- James Joyce.
- Smart, Colin.

04:09.509 --> 04:11.807
Guineas from the North End,
down Providence...

04:11.978 --> 04:14.674
...tried to tell me what to do.

04:14.848 --> 04:18.613
And something maybe happened to them.

04:19.418 --> 04:22.786
Maybe like that:

04:29.229 --> 04:33.290
Jeez. She fell funny.

04:36.302 --> 04:38.702
Francis, you really should see somebody.

04:38.872 --> 04:42.171
<i>When you decide to be something,</i>
<i>you can be it.</i>

04:42.809 --> 04:45.607
That's what they don't tell you
in the Church.

04:45.778 --> 04:50.306
When I was your age, they would say
we could become cops or criminals.

04:50.483 --> 04:53.247
Today what I'm saying to you is this:

04:53.419 --> 04:56.980
When you're facing a loaded gun...

04:58.892 --> 05:01.122
...what's the difference?

05:03.763 --> 05:06.095
<i>That's my boy.</i>

05:06.633 --> 05:09.397
Terminal ballistics is the study
of a projectile...

05:09.569 --> 05:12.265
...as it hits a target
and the destruction that it causes.

05:12.438 --> 05:15.532
Take, for instance, what you carry,
9 mm hollow-point.

05:15.708 --> 05:19.337
When the hollow-point hits the skull,
what happens is it mushrooms.

05:19.512 --> 05:22.379
<i>When it mushrooms it peels back.</i>
<i>So you may have six, eight...</i>

05:22.549 --> 05:25.712
...ten little particles
of the bullet that are like razor blades...

05:25.885 --> 05:27.011
Sir, yes, sir!

05:27.187 --> 05:30.623
<i>- tearing their internal organs,</i>
<i>their liver, their lungs, their heart...</i>

05:30.790 --> 05:34.351
...bringing tissue, bone, blood,
brain matter, and that's called a blowback.

05:41.901 --> 05:44.426
Fuck you. Fucking queers.

05:44.604 --> 05:48.404
Firemen getting pussy for the first time
in the history of fire or pussy.

05:48.575 --> 05:52.272
Hey, go save a kitten in a tree,
you fucking homos.

05:53.746 --> 05:55.236
Pencils.

06:01.054 --> 06:02.282
Begin.

06:10.029 --> 06:12.020
What are you looking at?

06:14.801 --> 06:16.234
Forget it.

06:16.402 --> 06:20.031
Your father was a janitor,
his son's only a cop.

06:22.909 --> 06:26.310
Those fucking firefighters are
a bunch of homos.

06:27.046 --> 06:28.274
They are.

06:28.448 --> 06:32.009
So she tells me, "You never finish anything.
You finish the police course...

06:32.185 --> 06:37.623
...you get taken care of again, baby."
So after graduation, I get a blowjob again.

06:37.790 --> 06:40.623
That's great.
Your mother must be a wonderful woman.

06:40.793 --> 06:41.817
Fuck yourself.

06:41.995 --> 06:44.361
Put it this way.
You're a black guy in Boston.

06:44.530 --> 06:47.090
You don't need any help from me
to be completely fucked.

06:47.267 --> 06:50.532
The Massachusetts State Police
has a long tradition of excellence.

06:50.870 --> 06:54.203
Your graduation today solidifies
your acceptance...

06:54.374 --> 06:57.468
...into one of the finest law enforcement
agencies in our nation.

06:57.644 --> 07:01.410
As the governor of the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts, I am confident...

07:01.581 --> 07:06.951
...each and every one of you will serve
with distinction, honor and integrity.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.054
Congratulations to all our new troopers.

07:09.222 --> 07:12.316
Thank you. You are dismissed.

07:22.902 --> 07:26.531
Sullivan, assigned to plainclothes right out
of the gate, congratulations.

07:26.706 --> 07:30.472
- We're going for a beer. You wanna come?
- No, I'll catch up with you guys.

07:39.352 --> 07:41.411
School's out.

07:43.156 --> 07:45.124
Thank you, Frank.

07:45.425 --> 07:46.915
You earned it.

07:47.093 --> 07:50.153
No more pencils, no more books.

07:52.865 --> 07:53.854
All right.

07:54.033 --> 07:55.557
<i>This is not the regular police...</i>

07:55.735 --> 07:57.635
<i>...this is the state police.</i>
- And fire!

07:57.837 --> 07:59.930
<i>Your training will illustrate the difference.</i>

08:00.106 --> 08:02.802
State police, search warrant!
State police, open the door!

08:02.975 --> 08:04.340
<i>What's the difference?</i>

08:04.510 --> 08:06.910
- Go, go, go!
<i>- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

08:07.080 --> 08:10.140
<i>- Is that understood?</i>
<i>- Sir, yes, sir!</i>

08:10.316 --> 08:13.479
Move it, get the fuck down right now.
Get down, right now.

08:24.497 --> 08:27.398
Congratulations on passing
the detective's exam, and welcome...

08:27.567 --> 08:31.059
...to the Special Investigation Unit.
- Whoop-de-fucking-do.

08:31.704 --> 08:34.104
We won't be working together,
that is, directly.

08:34.273 --> 08:38.107
You'll be working for Captain Ellerby,
but I like to see everybody.

08:40.011 --> 08:42.775
You're a worker. You rise fast.

08:42.948 --> 08:44.940
Like a 12-year-old's dick.

08:46.519 --> 08:49.147
- Thank you, sergeant.
- My pleasure.

08:49.322 --> 08:51.688
- Thank you, sir.
- Good luck.

08:57.997 --> 09:01.091
- Congratulations.
- Thanks, hon.

09:03.903 --> 09:05.894
You can go in there now.

09:12.178 --> 09:13.805
You can sit.

09:19.085 --> 09:20.484
So...

09:22.021 --> 09:24.421
Do you know what we do here?
My section?

09:26.692 --> 09:29.388
- Yes, sir, I have an idea...
- Let's say you have no idea...

09:29.595 --> 09:31.256
...and leave it at that, okay?

09:31.431 --> 09:33.922
No idea. Zip. None.

09:34.534 --> 09:38.026
If you had an idea what we do, we would
not be good at what we do, would we?

09:38.204 --> 09:39.728
We would be cunts.

09:39.906 --> 09:41.931
Are you calling us cunts?

09:42.108 --> 09:44.508
Staff Sergeant Dignam
has a style of his own.

09:44.677 --> 09:47.612
I'm afraid we all have to get used to it.

09:48.214 --> 09:52.241
So you have family connections down
in Southie, right? Through your father?

09:52.418 --> 09:54.943
Why don't you tell us
about your Uncle Jackie?

09:59.792 --> 10:01.760
He was a carpet layer for Jordan Marsh.

10:01.961 --> 10:06.227
Uncle Jackie was a small-time bookie
who tended bar at the Vets in Somerville.

10:06.399 --> 10:10.130
He got popped by Nicastro in '95.
We found his body out by the airport.

10:12.405 --> 10:14.236
That's right.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.799
- I remember his funeral.
- Oh, good.

10:17.510 --> 10:19.205
Closed casket?

10:20.880 --> 10:22.643
That's right.

10:23.216 --> 10:25.184
So tell anybody up at Deerfield...

10:25.351 --> 10:28.479
Before you got kicked out for whaling
on a gym teacher with a chair.

10:28.654 --> 10:31.054
- you had an uncle met his demise
like that?

10:35.528 --> 10:36.995
I got a question.

10:37.163 --> 10:39.222
How fucked up are you?

10:50.543 --> 10:52.636
Hi, Darlene.

10:54.847 --> 10:59.045
What you got, staff sergeant?
In no time you made sergeant.

10:59.619 --> 11:04.022
- SIU. What a country.
- Perfect.

11:05.958 --> 11:08.153
Hey, I don't mind going it alone.

11:08.327 --> 11:11.455
You know, if you went alone once
in a while you might get somewhere.

11:11.631 --> 11:14.293
We're cops, all right?
This isn't somewhere.

11:14.800 --> 11:19.203
All right, lookit, I know you're a worker.
Maybe I can do something for you.

11:19.705 --> 11:21.468
You got any suits,
or do you like...

11:21.641 --> 11:24.474
...coming to work dressed like
you're gonna invade Poland?

11:26.712 --> 11:29.476
You got quite the family tree.
That maggot uncle of yours...

11:29.649 --> 11:33.016
...Tommy Costigan, is another goof.
He gets busted selling guns...

11:33.185 --> 11:36.211
...to federal officers, among many,
many, many other departures...

11:36.389 --> 11:39.722
...from our normative behavior.
- And what's this got to do with me?

11:39.892 --> 11:41.655
Why are you pretending to be a cop?

11:45.631 --> 11:48.998
This unit is new, and you are
the newest members of it.

11:49.168 --> 11:52.729
You have been selected for it
on the basis of intelligence and aptitude.

11:52.905 --> 11:55.999
This is an elite unit.

11:56.175 --> 12:00.441
Our job is to smash
or marginally disrupt...

12:00.613 --> 12:02.672
...organized crime in this city...

12:02.848 --> 12:05.578
...by enhanced cooperation
with the FBI...

12:05.751 --> 12:08.515
...represented here today
by Agent Frank Lazio.

12:08.688 --> 12:10.849
And we will do it.

12:11.023 --> 12:14.481
And by organized crime in this city,
you know who we mean.

12:14.794 --> 12:16.955
That's Jackie Costigan.
That's an old picture.

12:17.129 --> 12:19.188
Jackie met his demise.

12:19.532 --> 12:21.295
Last known photograph.

12:22.902 --> 12:24.927
Costello uses three key guys.

12:25.104 --> 12:28.631
That's Fitzy. Off-the-boat psycho,
lives in Brockton with his mother.

12:28.808 --> 12:31.504
She's straight out of <i>Going My Way.</i>

12:31.677 --> 12:33.770
Delahunt, muscle.

12:33.946 --> 12:37.905
French, the number one.
But of course, the rock star, you-know-who.

12:38.084 --> 12:40.814
We've done a briefing book, so read up.
I want all ideas...

12:40.987 --> 12:43.148
...so I can pass them off as my own.

12:43.322 --> 12:46.450
Work hard, you'll rise fast.
You're in the best possible position...

12:46.626 --> 12:48.389
...in the department.
Let's go to work.

12:48.594 --> 12:50.858
Your old man was a fucking hump
from Southie.

12:51.030 --> 12:53.999
Baggage handler at the airport, right?

12:54.166 --> 12:56.634
Family's all criminals except
for the old man, huh?

12:56.802 --> 12:59.270
And one priest, since you seem
to know everything.

12:59.438 --> 13:03.306
Last I heard he was married to a 12-year-old
boy, living on a beach in Thailand.

13:03.476 --> 13:06.377
Fucking family's dug
into the Southie projects like ticks.

13:06.545 --> 13:08.843
Three-decker men at best.
You, however, grew up...

13:09.015 --> 13:12.883
...on the North Shore, huh?
Well, la-di-fucking-da.

13:13.052 --> 13:15.282
You were kind of a double kid,
I bet, right?

13:15.988 --> 13:18.388
One kid with your old man,
one kid with your mother.

13:18.557 --> 13:21.822
You're upper-middle class during the weeks,
then you're hanging...

13:21.994 --> 13:24.963
...in the Southie projects
with your daddy, the fucking donkey...

13:25.131 --> 13:27.622
...on the weekends. I got that right?

13:28.401 --> 13:31.564
Yup.
You have different accents?

13:32.104 --> 13:34.629
You did, didn't you,
you little fucking snake?

13:34.807 --> 13:38.038
- You were like different people.
- You a psychiatrist?

13:38.210 --> 13:41.179
If I was, I'd ask you
why you're a statie making 30 grand a year.

13:41.347 --> 13:44.839
And I think if I was Sigmund fucking Freud
I wouldn't get an answer.

13:45.017 --> 13:50.080
Tell me, what's a lace-curtain motherfucker
like you doing in the staties?

13:51.090 --> 13:54.582
Well, families are always rising
or falling in America, am I right?

13:54.760 --> 13:57.388
- Who said that?
- Hawthorne.

13:58.397 --> 14:01.855
What's the matter, smart-ass,
you don't know any fucking Shakespeare?

14:04.970 --> 14:07.200
We have a question.

14:08.374 --> 14:13.038
Do you wanna be a cop,
or do you wanna appear to be a cop?

14:13.212 --> 14:14.509
It's an honest question.

14:14.680 --> 14:18.343
Lot of guys want to appear to be cops.
Gun, badge, pretend they're on TV.

14:18.517 --> 14:21.145
A lot of them just wanna slam a nigger
through a window...

14:21.320 --> 14:24.118
I'm set without your
own personal job application, sergeant.

14:24.290 --> 14:26.554
- What did you say?
- Sir, what do you want from me?

14:26.759 --> 14:27.817
Hey, he can't help you.

14:27.993 --> 14:29.961
I know what you are.
I know what you are...

14:30.129 --> 14:31.494
...and I know what you're not.

14:31.664 --> 14:35.100
I'm the best friend you have and I'm gonna
help you understand something.

14:35.267 --> 14:37.235
You're no fucking cop.

14:38.804 --> 14:41.932
He's right.
We deal in deception here.

14:42.108 --> 14:44.941
What we do not deal with
is self-deception.

14:45.111 --> 14:47.944
Five years from now you could be
anything else in the world.

14:48.114 --> 14:51.709
But you will not be
a Massachusetts state trooper.

14:52.384 --> 14:54.545
- Are you sure of that?
- I'm sure of that.

14:54.720 --> 14:55.812
Guaran-fucking-teed.

14:58.124 --> 15:02.720
You had 1400 on your SATs, kid.
You're an astronaut, not a statie.

15:04.630 --> 15:06.825
You don't have much family.

15:07.299 --> 15:09.494
I don't have any family.

15:14.140 --> 15:18.509
What's this I hear from Stephanie
about you becoming a policeman?

15:18.677 --> 15:21.612
Stephanie, who was the only one
who came to my father's funeral?

15:21.781 --> 15:25.182
- That Stephanie?
- Yeah, that Stephanie.

15:25.351 --> 15:29.185
- Nothing much to it, Uncle Edward.
- Trying to prove something to the family?

15:29.355 --> 15:34.349
When you say "the family,"
who do you mean exactly? You?

15:35.361 --> 15:37.761
You always have to question everything,
don't you?

15:37.930 --> 15:41.957
Maybe it would've done you some good
to have some questions from time to time.

15:42.134 --> 15:44.830
"Am I an asshole?
Are my kids a mess?

15:45.004 --> 15:49.703
Is my wife a money-grubbing whore?"
I mean, those are questions, right?

15:49.875 --> 15:54.642
"Have I ever been good to my dying sister,
or am I just now pretending to be?"

15:58.851 --> 16:01.786
Do you need some money for the funeral?

16:04.223 --> 16:07.818
When my mother dies,
we don't have any more connection.

16:08.360 --> 16:13.423
It's lovely. You get the high ceilings,
the parquet floors. Bathroom is massive.

16:13.599 --> 16:16.227
The fridge has got an alarm in it
in case you have...

16:16.402 --> 16:19.633
...eating issues, which is a joke.
Not a very funny one.

16:19.805 --> 16:23.764
Well, there's a great view of the
State House. Beacon Hill, you can see it.

16:24.376 --> 16:27.345
I mean, you move in,
you're upper-class by about Tuesday.

16:28.347 --> 16:32.078
- So you're a cop.
- A state-police detective.

16:32.251 --> 16:34.082
A state-police detective.

16:34.687 --> 16:37.588
And are you a married
state-police detective?

16:37.823 --> 16:39.256
No.

16:40.192 --> 16:42.854
Because this is kind of a...
Sort of a big place and...

16:43.028 --> 16:45.053
I have a co-signer.

16:45.431 --> 16:49.925
Oh, cool. Yeah, you intend
to have a houseguest. That's cool. Good.

16:50.102 --> 16:52.400
- Yeah, it's got...
- Just give me the papers.

16:53.339 --> 16:55.034
Sure.

16:55.507 --> 17:00.342
Eternal rest grant unto her, O Lord,
and let perpetual light shine upon her.

17:00.512 --> 17:03.037
- Amen.
- May she rest in peace. Amen.

17:03.215 --> 17:06.412
May her soul and the souls
of all the faithful departed...

17:06.585 --> 17:09.781
...through the mercy of God
rest in peace.

17:10.990 --> 17:12.752
Amen.

17:34.780 --> 17:36.179
So what do I do?

17:36.515 --> 17:40.315
There's money behind this operation.
You won't be paid as a regular cop...

17:40.486 --> 17:42.579
...but there's a bonus involved.

17:43.188 --> 17:45.088
Tax-free.

17:46.125 --> 17:50.994
We can't conceal that you were a trainee.
You'll be convicted of a crime.

17:51.163 --> 17:54.894
We're thinking a guilty plea
to assault and battery would make sense.

17:55.067 --> 17:56.125
Given your nature.

17:56.335 --> 17:59.304
You'll do enough jail time
to convince anyone this is no setup.

17:59.471 --> 18:01.996
You'll be on probation,
see a court-ordered shrink...

18:02.174 --> 18:03.869
...the whole nine yards.

18:05.344 --> 18:08.370
You wanna serve the Commonwealth,
this is your chance.

18:09.381 --> 18:10.905
We need you, pal.

18:11.083 --> 18:13.950
You've already pretended
to be a Costigan from South Boston.

18:14.119 --> 18:18.078
- Every weekend, sergeant.
- Perfect.

18:19.792 --> 18:21.589
Do it again.

18:22.761 --> 18:24.422
For me.

18:58.230 --> 19:01.666
- Hey, you Billy Costigan?
- Yeah, who wants to know?

19:01.834 --> 19:04.735
Well, nothing.
I know a Sean Costigan down on L Street.

19:04.903 --> 19:08.236
- Yeah, that's my cousin.
- Connected. Not too bright.

19:08.407 --> 19:11.069
- Yeah, I know.
- I mean, no offense.

19:28.093 --> 19:29.924
- Billy?
- Yeah, it's me.

19:30.095 --> 19:33.030
- Oh, my God. Good to see you.
- Aunt Kathy, how are you?

19:33.198 --> 19:36.190
Oh, good to see you. Come on in.

19:37.236 --> 19:40.535
They said you was in the staties.
I couldn't believe it.

19:40.706 --> 19:42.970
I got kicked out, like, four months ago.

19:43.142 --> 19:45.372
Yeah, it was in the papers.

19:47.212 --> 19:48.907
So you know.

19:49.081 --> 19:51.914
And why are we graced
with your presence?

19:52.418 --> 19:54.886
I brought your mother
some pictures of my father.

19:55.054 --> 19:58.182
- Look at the smile.
- My mother had them. My...

19:59.792 --> 20:00.986
My mother's dead.

20:02.494 --> 20:05.554
I'm sorry.
Sorry for your troubles.

20:05.731 --> 20:08.291
I was at a funeral myself, man.

20:09.068 --> 20:11.468
Myles Kennefick.
Knew him in school.

20:12.805 --> 20:15.899
He was a young guy, you know?
It's terrible. It's a shame.

20:16.075 --> 20:18.236
- You remember that. What a night.
- Listen.

20:20.245 --> 20:21.735
I got, like...

20:21.914 --> 20:25.372
- Like 30,000 bucks, right? Insurance money.
- Yeah.

20:25.551 --> 20:28.315
You know, after my mother passed
and everything.

20:28.487 --> 20:31.149
In your line of work, if I gave you...

20:31.323 --> 20:35.020
...like, what, say, 10,000,
what could I get back?

20:36.728 --> 20:38.559
You know what you...

20:38.730 --> 20:41.062
You know what you usually say
at these moments.

20:41.233 --> 20:45.329
- What? What?
- Come on, man.

20:45.504 --> 20:49.406
Oh, come on, you fucking moron.
Come on.

20:49.575 --> 20:51.202
What, you want me to say it?

20:54.980 --> 20:57.915
I'm not a cop, all right?

20:58.450 --> 21:02.250
- I'm your fucking cousin.
- You're bad.

21:03.155 --> 21:06.215
You corrupt fuck, man.
You must be my cousin.

21:08.894 --> 21:10.953
Fucking Ricans think
they know everything.

21:11.130 --> 21:14.657
If they knew shit,
they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans.

21:14.867 --> 21:18.303
<i>R is for Ricans</i>
<i>P is for pigs</i>

21:18.470 --> 21:21.564
Would you shut the fuck up
for five seconds, huh?

21:21.740 --> 21:24.709
That's right. You used to be a cop.

21:24.910 --> 21:28.311
When we're working together
just limit it to two eight-balls an hour.

21:28.480 --> 21:31.938
We're not even supposed to be doing
this shit this close to Worcester.

21:32.117 --> 21:33.550
This side of Worcester.

21:34.286 --> 21:37.449
- Says who?
- Says him. Says Costello.

21:37.623 --> 21:39.614
God says, as far as you're...

21:40.292 --> 21:41.623
...concerned.

21:44.730 --> 21:47.665
No, no, he's no cop. He got out
of the joint three weeks ago.

21:47.833 --> 21:50.199
- Cunt cop.
- No, no, no.

21:50.369 --> 21:53.133
He talks like his shit don't stink,
but he's good people.

21:53.305 --> 21:55.773
Well, I knew his father.

21:56.074 --> 21:58.668
- I liked his Uncle Jackie better.
- Jackie was all right.

21:58.844 --> 22:01.335
Uncle Jackie was excellent.

22:01.513 --> 22:03.481
Fucking guineas.

22:03.749 --> 22:06.149
- To Jackie.
- Uncle Jackie.

22:07.419 --> 22:09.410
Cranberry juice.

22:11.123 --> 22:12.750
It's a natural diuretic.

22:12.925 --> 22:16.122
My girlfriend drinks it
when she's got her period.

22:16.929 --> 22:19.227
What, do you got your period?

22:23.435 --> 22:25.869
- Fucking...!
- Get off!

22:28.941 --> 22:32.672
- Get your fucking hands off me!
- Hey. Hey, hey.

22:34.146 --> 22:35.738
Do you know me?

22:36.014 --> 22:37.777
No. No.

22:39.284 --> 22:42.151
Well, I'm the guy that tells you
there are guys you can hit...

22:42.321 --> 22:44.312
...and there's guys you can't.

22:44.489 --> 22:46.480
Now, that's not quite a guy
you can't hit...

22:46.658 --> 22:48.922
...but it's almost a guy you can't hit.

22:49.094 --> 22:51.756
So I'm gonna make a fucking ruling
on this right now:

22:51.930 --> 22:54.956
You don't fucking hit him.
You understand?

22:57.769 --> 23:00.329
Yeah, excellent. Fine. Fine, fine.

23:01.840 --> 23:05.435
I fucking know you. I know your family.

23:05.978 --> 23:07.570
You make one more drug deal...

23:07.746 --> 23:10.579
...with that idiot fucking cop-magnet
of a cousin of yours...

23:11.383 --> 23:14.045
...and I'll forget your grandmother was
so nice to me.

23:14.219 --> 23:17.313
I'll cut your fucking nuts off.
You understand that?

23:18.991 --> 23:22.222
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

23:24.129 --> 23:25.653
What are you drinking?

23:32.504 --> 23:34.631
A cranberry juice.

23:35.974 --> 23:38.101
What is it, your period?

23:41.146 --> 23:44.377
Get him a cranberry juice.

23:50.922 --> 23:52.947
Hey, fuckhead, that's Jackie's nephew.

23:54.559 --> 23:56.789
What? "Oh," fucking what?

24:00.599 --> 24:01.930
Get the fuck out of here.

24:02.301 --> 24:03.768
Sorry I'm late.

24:03.935 --> 24:06.870
Staff Sergeant Dignam is our liaison
to the undercover section.

24:07.039 --> 24:08.631
His undercover work is extensive.

24:08.807 --> 24:11.037
He's here to give us his report.
Sergeant Dignam.

24:11.209 --> 24:13.439
Okay, my people are out there.

24:13.612 --> 24:16.172
They're like fucking Indians.
You're not gonna see them.

24:16.348 --> 24:18.782
You'll hear about them
through me or Captain Queenan.

24:18.950 --> 24:21.783
You will not ever know the identity
of undercover people.

24:21.953 --> 24:24.888
Unfortunately, this shithole has more
leaks than the Iraqi navy.

24:25.057 --> 24:27.321
- Fuck yourself.
- I'm tired from fucking your wife.

24:27.492 --> 24:29.756
- How's your mother?
- Tired from fucking my father.

24:30.295 --> 24:31.762
Good. Today, girls...

24:31.930 --> 24:33.830
...what I have is microprocessors.

24:35.033 --> 24:38.332
Somebody, as you may already know,
stole 20 microprocessors...

24:38.503 --> 24:41.063
...from the Mass Processor Company
out on Route 128.

24:41.239 --> 24:43.503
These are the kind
they put into computers...

24:43.675 --> 24:46.508
...that could put a cruise missile
up the ass of a camel...

24:46.678 --> 24:48.509
...from a couple hundred miles away.

24:48.680 --> 24:51.513
These pieces of plastic are worth
about 100 grand apiece.

24:51.683 --> 24:54.243
We got a guy working
for the company two months...

24:54.419 --> 24:57.354
...walks out the door with
a box of processors on Tuesday...

24:57.522 --> 24:59.581
...has a ticket for Florida
on Wednesday...

24:59.758 --> 25:02.124
...but on Thursday, he gets found
in a Dumpster.

25:02.294 --> 25:04.455
You know where that dirtball
started his life?

25:04.629 --> 25:06.187
Southie projects.

25:06.365 --> 25:09.027
- What was his name, the departed?
- Myles Kennefick.

25:09.201 --> 25:12.227
Got the job with a forged UMass
transcript. UMass, Boston...

25:12.404 --> 25:14.133
...which happens to...
- South Boston?

25:14.306 --> 25:17.366
Oh, you're a fucking genius.
Who forged your transcript, dickhead?

25:17.542 --> 25:20.739
His old man runs
the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's.

25:23.081 --> 25:25.641
We're not here to solve
the case of the missing scumbag.

25:25.817 --> 25:27.250
We're here to nail Costello.

25:27.419 --> 25:28.886
All right, look. We got a guy...

25:29.054 --> 25:31.579
...says Costello's moving
the processors to China.

25:31.757 --> 25:34.225
He set up the whole fucking job
and popped Kennefick.

25:34.393 --> 25:36.793
You do not want to miss it
if Costello takes a dump.

25:36.962 --> 25:40.398
We'd miss less if you made your
informants available to us and the Bureau.

25:40.599 --> 25:44.296
Without asking for too many details,
do you have anyone in with Costello now?

25:44.770 --> 25:47.068
Maybe. Maybe not.

25:47.239 --> 25:48.934
Maybe fuck yourself.

25:49.107 --> 25:51.439
My theory on Feds
is they're like mushrooms.

25:51.610 --> 25:53.510
Feed them shit
and keep them in the dark.

25:53.678 --> 25:55.305
You girls have a good day.

25:56.114 --> 25:59.777
Normally he's a very nice guy.

25:59.951 --> 26:01.851
Don't judge him from this meeting alone.

26:04.923 --> 26:08.086
Now, Mrs. Kennefick, I knew your son.

26:08.260 --> 26:09.989
I knew Myles.

26:10.162 --> 26:12.995
He was younger than me,
but he was behind me in school.

26:13.165 --> 26:15.326
I wanna get these people
who did this to him.

26:15.500 --> 26:18.492
Would you like to help us?
You wanna help catch the people...

26:18.670 --> 26:21.503
...who forced your son to do a robbery
and then killed him?

26:22.140 --> 26:23.505
Allegedly.

26:24.443 --> 26:25.671
Allegedly.

26:25.844 --> 26:28.312
If he was killed,
he probably did something wrong.

26:28.480 --> 26:30.448
But not the robbery. That's not wrong.

26:30.615 --> 26:32.674
He did something else wrong?

26:34.953 --> 26:37.979
Wave to your girlfriend, honey.

26:39.825 --> 26:42.020
I mean, fuck yourself.

26:43.662 --> 26:46.130
- Did you get that?
- "Allegedly" or "fuck yourself"?

26:46.298 --> 26:49.734
- Welcome to the neighborhood.
- Different breed down here, sarge.

26:51.236 --> 26:52.703
I need a cup of coffee.

27:06.451 --> 27:08.715
You making a house call?

27:09.354 --> 27:11.345
Have I seen you professionally?

27:11.523 --> 27:15.015
No, no. No, I know who you are, though.
I know.

27:15.193 --> 27:18.856
Guys gotta use their service revolver
in the course of duty...

27:19.030 --> 27:22.625
...and then they get to come to talk
to you about their feelings and whatnot.

27:22.801 --> 27:26.635
No, no, I know how it goes.
You're a mental health professional.

27:26.805 --> 27:28.466
I have an appointment on this floor.

27:28.640 --> 27:32.098
Oh, well, you'll have fun. They're all
frigging crazy on that floor.

27:32.277 --> 27:34.370
- I'm one more up.
- Oh, fancy policeman.

27:34.546 --> 27:36.639
- Yeah, that's right, fancy.
- Are you a statie?

27:36.815 --> 27:39.943
Yeah, I am. I'm actually
going to law school also.

27:40.118 --> 27:41.415
Suffolk, nights?

27:41.586 --> 27:44.453
Yeah, they don't run Harvard
at night, last time I checked.

27:44.623 --> 27:48.115
- When's the last time you checked?
- Before I went to fucking Suffolk.

27:48.293 --> 27:51.057
Okay, listen, I went to UMass.
I wasn't insulting you.

27:51.229 --> 27:53.891
Well, I thought you were.
So now you gotta buy me dinner.

27:54.065 --> 27:56.863
Maybe you can shoot someone
and then see me professionally.

27:57.035 --> 28:02.132
I'll stab someone in the heart with a fucking
ice pick if it gets me dinner with you.

28:02.307 --> 28:04.537
That's all right. I'm a detective.
I'll find you.

28:04.709 --> 28:07.735
No, sorry. I'm just joking.
I need the card. Card helps.

28:07.913 --> 28:09.403
Nice to meet you, Madolyn.

28:19.324 --> 28:23.021
Hi, Dad. I had no idea about the tail
until I saw it.

28:23.194 --> 28:26.027
No, I couldn't.
I had the other guy with me, I couldn't...

28:26.197 --> 28:29.325
All right, it's a blue sedan
and then a white van.

28:29.501 --> 28:32.629
It's fucked up with graffiti.
And the van is the audio surveillance.

28:32.804 --> 28:34.101
All right, have a nice day.

28:35.373 --> 28:37.102
Cut him here.

28:37.876 --> 28:39.343
Bye-bye.

28:43.582 --> 28:44.606
Jerk-ass!

28:44.783 --> 28:47.445
Come on, Babu. I can't do anymore.
I cannot hold off.

28:47.619 --> 28:51.146
Don't let me go back empty-handed.
Don't do this. I wanna help you.

28:51.323 --> 28:54.292
Come to my store next Friday.
I'll give you the money.

28:54.459 --> 28:56.950
This is Friday, Babu.
How many times I gotta tell you?

28:57.128 --> 29:00.154
You keep on calling me Babu.
It's Singh, motherfucker.

29:00.332 --> 29:01.560
I'm trying to help you.

29:01.733 --> 29:05.169
You keep telling me I'm your friend.
You don't even know my fucking name.

29:05.337 --> 29:08.795
I'm gonna catch a beating if I go back
again like last week.

29:08.974 --> 29:12.432
See this guy? You see this guy?
This guy don't want you to have the money.

29:12.611 --> 29:15.444
Because he wants to come back there
and squash your head.

29:15.614 --> 29:18.048
I have one customer sitting here.
What I'm gonna do?

29:18.216 --> 29:21.083
Business is bad? You opened a store
in an Irish neighborhood.

29:21.252 --> 29:23.482
These are dirty people.
Don't you know that?

29:23.655 --> 29:25.885
Sell potatoes,
I don't know what you're gonna do.

29:26.057 --> 29:29.151
- Excuse me, gentlemen. Excuse me. Sorry.
- Know what I'm saying?

29:29.327 --> 29:30.851
You fellas come from Providence?

29:31.029 --> 29:33.088
It isn't any of your business, is it, now?

29:33.264 --> 29:35.789
What, are you fucking delivering
cannolis or something?

29:45.644 --> 29:48.807
Hey! You are killing my business, man!

29:49.547 --> 29:50.741
Fuck!

29:50.915 --> 29:54.078
What's wrong with this fucking country?
Everybody hates everybody!

29:59.424 --> 30:01.358
Get out of here. Get out of here!

30:07.999 --> 30:11.696
- Now, you also do probation work, right?
- That's right, I see violent offenders.

30:11.870 --> 30:15.931
- Oh, bad guys.
- Not necessarily.

30:21.646 --> 30:24.581
Yeah, they got this but they don't got
duck I'orange.

30:24.749 --> 30:26.307
Was your meal okay?

30:26.484 --> 30:28.042
Yeah, no, the lobster was good.

30:28.219 --> 30:31.620
I just, you know, because it was
a French restaurant I was surprised.

30:37.328 --> 30:39.125
I'm waiting for you to make your move.

30:39.297 --> 30:42.232
Look, I don't know, if that thing moves,
I'm gonna shoot it.

30:42.400 --> 30:43.765
I don't even know what it is.

30:51.076 --> 30:53.874
So what's it like having people
find themselves...

30:54.045 --> 30:55.910
...in your office all day long?

30:56.081 --> 30:58.709
Does it get messy with all those
feelings flying around?

31:00.051 --> 31:02.417
Why, does that make you
uncomfortable?

31:02.587 --> 31:03.986
- No, no, no.
- No?

31:04.155 --> 31:06.487
No, no, no. No, I'm not on your couch.

31:07.859 --> 31:10.054
Well, you know what Freud said
about the Irish?

31:10.228 --> 31:11.627
Yeah, I do.

31:12.197 --> 31:14.961
Yeah, if you actually do,
I'll see you again.

31:15.934 --> 31:18.767
Who says I wanna see you again?

31:22.640 --> 31:24.403
Don't you?

31:26.144 --> 31:28.044
- You should see your face.
- Don't you?

31:28.213 --> 31:29.646
Course I wanna see you again.

31:30.348 --> 31:32.373
What Freud said about the Irish is...

31:32.550 --> 31:36.816
...we're the only people who are
impervious to psychoanalysis.

31:37.789 --> 31:40.121
- Yeah, he said that.
- I know he did.

31:40.291 --> 31:43.454
So you're up shit's creek with a client list
full of mick cops.

31:43.628 --> 31:45.619
I mean, opening up? Good luck to you.

31:45.797 --> 31:47.958
Why do you do it, then?

31:49.167 --> 31:51.294
Some people do get better.

31:54.305 --> 31:55.636
Fair enough.

31:55.807 --> 31:59.504
Sometimes I want people to forget
their personal bullshit and do their jobs.

32:00.478 --> 32:01.706
Including the criminals?

32:01.880 --> 32:04.144
If they don't do their jobs,
you don't have one.

32:04.916 --> 32:08.044
I'll always have a job.
I'll just arrest innocent people.

32:09.454 --> 32:12.048
- Wait. You are trouble.
- You don't know the half of it.

32:12.223 --> 32:14.316
I'll arrest you right now.

32:15.527 --> 32:17.427
<i>My word against yours.</i>

32:17.996 --> 32:21.523
- then I see her dancing at the wedding
with you-know-who.

32:22.834 --> 32:24.734
I say, "Why don't you
go to Parents Without Partners?"

32:24.903 --> 32:28.930
He goes, "Ma, they're all losers
at the Parents Without Partners," so...

32:31.609 --> 32:34.009
So I say to him,
"Princess Carolina of Monaco..."

32:36.714 --> 32:38.045
Schuyler.

32:51.729 --> 32:54.027
Do you know who I am?

32:57.268 --> 32:58.792
No.

33:02.807 --> 33:07.141
You met my friend Mr. French
the other night.

33:17.288 --> 33:19.813
His real name Mr. French?

33:22.727 --> 33:24.388
No.

33:27.999 --> 33:29.967
Come with me.

33:34.505 --> 33:38.771
I'm not the cops. I'm not asking you.

33:40.879 --> 33:45.441
You know something, they just do not stop
having the Mafia in Providence.

33:45.617 --> 33:49.485
And this can cause me a lot of problems.

33:55.526 --> 33:58.393
Those guys you tuned up...

33:58.563 --> 34:00.724
...they're connected down Providence.

34:02.233 --> 34:03.632
What they're gonna do...

34:03.801 --> 34:07.396
...is come back with some guys
and kill you.

34:07.572 --> 34:10.598
Which, sure as you're born,
they will do.

34:10.775 --> 34:13.175
Unless I stop them.

34:13.444 --> 34:15.411
Do you want me to stop them?

34:18.549 --> 34:20.779
Is this something I can't do personally?

34:24.656 --> 34:26.453
I'm gonna have my associate search you.

34:26.623 --> 34:28.922
No one's searching me.
Search me for what?

34:29.092 --> 34:31.822
Contra-fucking-band.
Take your shoes off.

34:32.397 --> 34:33.864
Shoes.

34:40.505 --> 34:41.995
I knew your father.

34:44.141 --> 34:48.306
Yeah? Do you know he's dead?

34:49.179 --> 34:52.149
Oh, sorry. How'd he go?

34:52.917 --> 34:55.976
- Stand.
- He didn't complain.

34:56.154 --> 34:58.884
Yeah, that was his problem.

34:59.524 --> 35:00.889
Who said he had a problem?

35:03.194 --> 35:05.719
I just said he had a fucking problem.

35:07.031 --> 35:09.363
There's a man could've been anything.

35:09.534 --> 35:11.934
Are you trying to say
that he was nothing?

35:12.103 --> 35:15.539
- Fuck.
- I'm saying he worked at the airport.

35:15.707 --> 35:17.572
- He's clean.
- Arm.

35:17.742 --> 35:19.004
Yeah, come on.

35:19.177 --> 35:20.701
What arm? What fucking arm?

35:20.878 --> 35:24.211
Show me your arm. Flip it.

35:31.022 --> 35:34.549
Makes me curious to see you
in this neighborhood.

35:36.294 --> 35:37.625
He's clean.

35:37.795 --> 35:41.060
And if I can slander my own
environment...

35:41.232 --> 35:45.032
...it makes me sad, this regression.

35:45.203 --> 35:50.163
Plus, I don't know if it's beyond some
fucking cop prick like Queenan...

35:50.341 --> 35:54.641
...to pull you out of the staties
and send you after me.

35:55.380 --> 35:57.746
I just can't know.

35:58.216 --> 36:02.414
I don't know what they do
in that particular department, anyway.

36:03.721 --> 36:06.815
- Are you still a cop?
- No! No!

36:07.358 --> 36:10.327
Swear on your mother's grave
you're still not a cop?

36:10.495 --> 36:13.328
I am not a fucking cop!

36:14.265 --> 36:19.168
Are you gonna stop doing coke deals
with your jerkoff fucking cousin?

36:19.337 --> 36:22.465
Yes. Yes, yes.

36:23.541 --> 36:25.668
All right, all right, all right.

36:25.843 --> 36:28.641
You're okay. You'll be all right.

36:29.180 --> 36:32.047
Get your hand taken care of.

36:33.117 --> 36:37.679
I'm sorry, but it was necessary.

36:38.956 --> 36:42.585
As for our problem with Providence...

36:43.428 --> 36:46.226
...let's not cry over spilled guineas.

36:48.766 --> 36:51.735
Who let this IRA motherfucker in my bar?

36:57.542 --> 36:59.339
Just kidding. How's your mother?

37:00.278 --> 37:01.745
She's on her way out.

37:01.913 --> 37:04.973
We all are. Act accordingly.

37:05.283 --> 37:07.513
Here it is, Your Highness, as ordered.

37:07.685 --> 37:09.846
Get in the car.
I wanna show you something.

37:10.021 --> 37:13.115
- What's got you all hot and bothered?
- Get in the car. You'll see.

37:13.991 --> 37:16.619
Do you trust him?

37:17.261 --> 37:18.489
Well, these days...

37:19.230 --> 37:20.788
...who's reliable?

37:21.332 --> 37:23.300
His Uncle Jackie was.

37:24.001 --> 37:28.461
Yeah, but you can't trust a guy
acts like he's got nothing to lose.

37:33.311 --> 37:35.108
I'm reliable.

37:35.913 --> 37:39.349
Arnold, you're one in a million.

37:39.517 --> 37:42.179
Ten. Ten million.

37:44.122 --> 37:46.818
What about your wife, Arnold?

37:49.327 --> 37:50.885
Well, I thought she was.

37:52.363 --> 37:54.160
She wasn't.

37:56.467 --> 37:58.332
Well, she got reliable.

38:00.438 --> 38:03.464
Don't you people ever shut the fuck up?

38:04.642 --> 38:06.667
Another county heard from.

38:06.844 --> 38:08.573
One too many. She got a big mouth.

38:08.746 --> 38:10.839
Answer this for me, will you?

38:31.669 --> 38:35.230
The principles of detection tell me
these two gentlemen came from Providence.

38:35.406 --> 38:39.103
Lieutenant Risteen, Lynn PD. I'd
appreciate it you get out of my crime scene.

38:39.277 --> 38:42.041
Yeah, actually, it's my crime scene,
but knock yourself out.

38:42.213 --> 38:43.680
Thanks.

38:45.650 --> 38:50.178
I saw a dead guy. I think I'm having
posttraumatic stress.

38:50.354 --> 38:52.151
Can I meet you for lunch?

38:52.323 --> 38:53.585
All right, see you then.

38:58.029 --> 38:59.792
Who's the lead detective?

38:59.964 --> 39:02.797
Good. He's a lox.

39:10.942 --> 39:15.038
Get the cops to look at Jimmy Pappas
for the hit. He had nothing to do with it...

39:15.213 --> 39:16.942
<i>...and he'll say so.</i>

39:17.114 --> 39:21.414
Look in his car, you'll find the gun
that did it, registered, official. Providence.

39:21.586 --> 39:23.781
In the trunk or the glove compartment?

39:25.089 --> 39:27.114
Hey, you wanna see some dead guys?

39:32.430 --> 39:35.058
Hey, this will get Captain Ellerby
on the 6:00 news.

39:35.233 --> 39:36.530
No wonder you get ahead.

39:42.740 --> 39:44.765
Have a seat, Bill.

39:52.483 --> 39:54.917
Do you know John Lennon?

39:56.020 --> 39:59.080
Yeah, sure, he was the president
before Lincoln.

40:01.626 --> 40:03.753
Lennon said:

40:04.495 --> 40:06.190
"I'm an artist.

40:06.364 --> 40:10.767
You give me a fucking tuba,
I'll get you something out of it."

40:15.039 --> 40:16.370
I tell you, Mr. Costello...

40:16.540 --> 40:19.805
...I'd like to squeeze
some fucking money out of it.

40:27.285 --> 40:29.583
Smart-mouth.

40:30.521 --> 40:32.421
Too bad.

40:33.624 --> 40:35.922
If you'll indulge me...

40:37.828 --> 40:38.817
Now what?

40:40.364 --> 40:42.298
Choir practice.

40:43.334 --> 40:44.665
Choir practice...

40:49.507 --> 40:51.941
The point I'm making
with John Lennon is...

40:53.077 --> 40:56.843
...a man could look at anything...

40:57.048 --> 40:58.675
...and make something out of it.

40:58.849 --> 41:00.316
For instance...

41:00.484 --> 41:02.884
...I look at you and I think:

41:03.821 --> 41:06.221
What could I use you for?

41:08.559 --> 41:10.220
Get rid of this.

41:10.394 --> 41:11.884
French.

41:12.063 --> 41:14.531
<i>Put it downstairs. Here.</i>
<i>Go ahead, thank you.</i>

41:14.699 --> 41:16.394
Maybe we could work something out.

41:17.234 --> 41:20.533
- Good.
- And send this to his wife.

41:20.705 --> 41:22.673
It was nice the way
you asked the guy...

41:22.840 --> 41:25.070
...which hand he jerked off with.

41:25.710 --> 41:27.177
I hope this don't shake Rita up.

41:28.579 --> 41:31.013
As I remember,
she ain't that sentimental.

41:39.123 --> 41:41.887
That was quick.
You think he's dead already?

41:42.693 --> 41:44.752
<i>We have to do it by phone.</i>
<i>I won't do it...</i>

41:44.929 --> 41:47.193
...if I have to wear a wire.
No wires. Understand?

41:47.365 --> 41:49.765
- You don't know what this is like.
<i>- Microprocessors.</i>

41:49.934 --> 41:52.232
- Micro what?
<i>- Microprocessors.</i>

41:52.403 --> 41:55.270
We'll probably be at war
with the Chinese in 20-odd years...

41:55.439 --> 41:58.374
...and Costello is selling them
military technology.

41:58.542 --> 42:00.942
Microprocessors, chips, computer parts.

42:01.112 --> 42:03.376
<i>Anybody says anything about</i>
<i>anything like that...</i>

42:03.547 --> 42:04.536
...you let us know.

42:08.519 --> 42:10.714
So who did the two guys
from Providence?

42:11.622 --> 42:13.385
Jimmy Pappas.

42:13.557 --> 42:15.548
What happened to Jimmy Pappas?

42:16.827 --> 42:19.022
Jimmy had a rough month.

42:19.263 --> 42:21.527
Jimmy had a heart attack in jail...

42:21.699 --> 42:24.896
...and then he got himself knifed
at Boston City Hospital.

42:25.069 --> 42:26.900
I believe it's been in the papers.

42:28.172 --> 42:30.106
You seem quite happy with that result.

42:31.642 --> 42:33.269
It's a fucking result.

42:33.444 --> 42:36.709
Yeah, but cui bono? Who benefits?

42:36.881 --> 42:39.907
Cui gives a shit?
It's got a frigging bow on it.

42:42.319 --> 42:45.152
I think you are a cop, my son.

42:46.857 --> 42:48.484
- Where's your license?
- What license?

42:48.659 --> 42:51.594
I don't see none. There's no such thing
as a license, of course.

42:51.762 --> 42:54.890
But you, you definitely need
to have fucking one.

42:55.065 --> 42:58.466
If you're not being run by us,
you're being run by someone else.

42:58.636 --> 43:01.161
That means you're bringing
undesirable elements...

43:01.338 --> 43:03.272
...into Mr. Costello's area.

43:08.646 --> 43:11.206
I was going for my fucking cigarettes!

43:11.382 --> 43:12.406
Hey.

43:14.385 --> 43:15.682
That's Jimmy Bags.

43:19.857 --> 43:22.587
- He was rea... I don't know.
- What the fuck you doing?

43:23.727 --> 43:25.388
I'm in the hole,
I pay him two grand.

43:25.563 --> 43:27.360
There's no profit, I pay him two grand.

43:27.531 --> 43:29.431
Then make more money.
This is America.

43:29.600 --> 43:32.899
You don't make money, you're
a douche bag. Now what you gonna do?

43:33.070 --> 43:35.698
- Make more money.
- That's the spirit!

43:35.873 --> 43:37.966
- Oh, fuck.
- Don't worry about it.

43:38.142 --> 43:40.667
The guy don't need
any fucking teeth anyway.

43:40.878 --> 43:43.972
It's a small surveillance subunit,
but it's mine.

43:44.148 --> 43:47.015
I didn't take this job to fuck up
or let anyone else fuck up.

43:47.184 --> 43:51.416
I handpicked this group.
You're my A team. Now, our prim...

43:52.223 --> 43:53.315
Hi, Captain.

43:53.491 --> 43:54.685
This crazy fuck...

43:54.859 --> 43:56.986
...knocked Jimmy Bags' teeth out.
- So?

43:57.161 --> 43:59.254
- He was...
- He was reaching for his cigarettes.

43:59.430 --> 44:02.263
You're gonna give me shit?
It wasn't for no reason, Frank.

44:02.433 --> 44:03.695
He reached into his coat.

44:03.868 --> 44:06.098
I don't know if he's a bookie
or what he's doing.

44:06.270 --> 44:08.704
Well, you do know
what a bookie does, don't you?

44:08.873 --> 44:10.932
Yeah. Yeah, he pays you.

44:11.108 --> 44:13.372
Queenan's compartmentalizing
everything in SIU...

44:13.544 --> 44:14.875
...which is the right thing.

44:15.045 --> 44:17.673
I don't trust half the troopers
out there anymore.

44:18.182 --> 44:20.082
Bottom line...

44:20.251 --> 44:22.344
...we think we might have a problem.

44:22.520 --> 44:25.387
We think Costello's got a rat
in the state police.

44:27.057 --> 44:29.457
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

44:29.627 --> 44:31.925
Do we have direct access
to Queenan's undercovers?

44:32.096 --> 44:34.690
No, no, not presently.

44:34.865 --> 44:36.298
But I'm working on that.

44:36.467 --> 44:38.594
Here, Bill, this is for you.

44:39.270 --> 44:42.899
From now on, call the bar,
ask for Mikey. Just Mikey.

44:43.073 --> 44:46.565
You ask for Mikey
because there is no Mikey.

44:46.844 --> 44:49.642
You wait. We'll call you.

44:49.813 --> 44:51.474
- You got that?
- Yeah, I got that.

44:51.649 --> 44:54.584
- Sorry, I didn't hear you.
- I got that.

44:54.752 --> 44:56.379
Good.

44:57.888 --> 44:59.753
Hi, Dad.

45:00.457 --> 45:02.721
I got promoted. All right.

45:20.277 --> 45:22.245
Excuse me for one second.

45:23.347 --> 45:25.144
You know...

45:26.417 --> 45:28.783
...if your father were alive...

45:28.953 --> 45:31.012
...and saw you here sitting with me...

45:31.188 --> 45:33.452
...let's say he'd have a word with me
about this.

45:33.624 --> 45:36.422
In fact, he'd kill seven guys
just to cut my throat.

45:36.594 --> 45:38.824
And he could do it...

45:39.430 --> 45:43.298
...which is maybe something
you don't know about William Costigan Sr.

45:48.072 --> 45:52.668
- So he never...? I mean, never?
- No. No, no.

45:52.843 --> 45:56.335
He kept his own counsel.
He never wanted money.

45:56.513 --> 45:58.811
You can't do anything
with a man like that.

45:59.883 --> 46:01.510
Your Uncle Jackie...

46:01.685 --> 46:06.452
...he also would kill my entire fucking
family if he saw me here with you.

46:08.459 --> 46:11.053
And I think about this.

46:16.967 --> 46:19.663
So what the fuck
are we talking about here?

46:20.471 --> 46:23.372
Did you ever think about
going back to school?

46:23.540 --> 46:25.565
School?

46:27.578 --> 46:30.308
With all due respect, Mr. Costello...

46:30.481 --> 46:32.574
...school is out.

46:33.317 --> 46:36.081
Maybe someday
you'll wake the fuck up.

46:37.888 --> 46:39.150
Good day, Fathers.

46:40.357 --> 46:43.326
- Mr. Costello.
- Good morning, Francis, good morning.

46:43.494 --> 46:46.156
You recall our chat?

46:46.463 --> 46:48.556
Little boys...

46:48.999 --> 46:53.163
...sucking on their peckers,
et cetera and so forth...

46:53.771 --> 46:56.171
"I am as God made me."
Was that your rationale?

46:58.242 --> 47:03.578
May I remind you, in this archdiocese,
God don't run the bingo.

47:03.747 --> 47:07.774
May I remind you
that pride comes before the fall.

47:10.287 --> 47:13.256
How's Sister Mary Theresa doing?

47:13.424 --> 47:16.825
We had a tasty relationship
before she took her vows.

47:17.628 --> 47:19.789
Enjoy your clams, cocksuckers.

47:19.963 --> 47:21.658
Pay them.

47:22.933 --> 47:26.027
Get the old bombardier a drink
on the house.

47:32.843 --> 47:35.971
- What do you got for me?
- Uniform clipped him for suspended license.

47:36.146 --> 47:38.512
However, he's a subject of
an open investigation...

47:38.682 --> 47:40.616
More than one. He's one of Costello's.

47:40.784 --> 47:43.344
We're getting a warrant.
Can't get an address off him.

47:43.520 --> 47:46.182
He paged his lawyer but
the lawyer hasn't called back yet.

47:46.356 --> 47:48.984
- Who's the lawyer?
- Didn't know the name. Just a number.

47:49.727 --> 47:51.126
Beeper number.

47:51.829 --> 47:54.127
- And the guy didn't show up?
- No.

47:55.199 --> 47:57.497
- And he beeped him?
- Twice.

48:01.739 --> 48:04.207
Give me your phone. Turn that off.

48:04.374 --> 48:06.501
- What?
- Turn the fucking camera off.

48:07.010 --> 48:10.104
Give it to me. He doesn't know
what the fucking lawyer looks like.

48:10.280 --> 48:12.339
Whose briefcase is this? All right.

48:12.516 --> 48:13.778
- It's off?
- You're good.

48:13.951 --> 48:16.613
Afternoon, Mr. Fitzgibbons.

48:16.920 --> 48:19.115
- He can't do that.
- He just did.

48:19.289 --> 48:22.747
- You my attorney?
- What do you think?

48:23.927 --> 48:25.918
Have you made statements
or phone calls...

48:26.096 --> 48:27.757
...I need to be made aware of?

48:29.833 --> 48:32.461
I beeped you.

48:32.703 --> 48:35.763
The card they gave me. That's it.

48:35.939 --> 48:39.340
- That's it?
- That's it.

48:42.546 --> 48:43.979
You need to call your mother...

48:44.148 --> 48:46.446
...tell her you're not gonna be home
for supper.

48:51.155 --> 48:54.682
Camera's off.
It's off. Call your mother.

48:57.961 --> 49:01.294
Lookit, they're suiting up for a raid
right now.

49:01.532 --> 49:05.059
I don't know where they're going,
but they do. And so do you.

49:07.070 --> 49:08.594
So make the call.

49:13.243 --> 49:16.701
Lookit, fuckstick,
you don't gotta trust me...

49:18.115 --> 49:20.777
...just listen to what I'm saying to you.

49:37.568 --> 49:42.062
Mom, I'm not gonna make it home
for supper.

49:42.239 --> 49:44.173
<i>Sorry, yeah, I got held up.</i>

49:45.709 --> 49:48.644
Yeah, no, you carry on without me.

49:49.680 --> 49:52.911
I'll talk to you later. Okay.

49:53.083 --> 49:54.846
Bye.

49:55.052 --> 49:58.249
Everybody out. Move.

50:15.372 --> 50:16.600
Thank you.

50:17.908 --> 50:19.341
So who are you?

50:19.509 --> 50:22.945
I think you need a different attorney,
Mr. Fitzgibbons. Have a great day.

50:23.113 --> 50:24.774
So when the fuck am I gonna get out?

50:24.948 --> 50:28.281
All right, run the last number he called.
That's his house.

50:28.452 --> 50:31.148
I'll swear to the judge
I surveilled him there...

50:31.321 --> 50:33.414
...and abra-fucking-cadabra,
we got a warrant.

50:33.590 --> 50:36.957
- Why did you use my phone?
- Because you didn't go in there.

50:48.071 --> 50:49.936
The light's nice here in the morning.

50:54.912 --> 50:57.540
So do you wanna talk about last night?

51:04.187 --> 51:07.714
You know, it's all right. Guys tend to make
too big a deal out of it.

51:13.297 --> 51:15.231
It's actually quite common.

51:15.399 --> 51:16.991
I gotta go to work.

51:26.209 --> 51:28.040
Do you lie?

51:29.446 --> 51:31.937
Why? Do you?

51:32.115 --> 51:33.810
No, I'm asking if you lie.

51:34.885 --> 51:37.285
Honesty is not synonymous with truth.

51:37.454 --> 51:39.547
Yeah, you lie.

51:39.723 --> 51:40.883
You lie.

51:41.191 --> 51:43.716
Is it to do some good,
to get somewhere personally...

51:43.894 --> 51:45.953
...or, what, just for the fuck of it?

51:46.596 --> 51:51.556
Well, I expect that some people do it
to keep things on an even keel.

51:55.005 --> 51:56.996
So you had a parent who was a drunk.

52:00.877 --> 52:02.606
Did you?

52:02.779 --> 52:04.406
No.

52:06.717 --> 52:08.480
Let's keep it with you.

52:08.652 --> 52:11.246
Talk about how you feel.

52:13.056 --> 52:15.354
<i>How I feel.</i>

52:15.525 --> 52:17.425
<i>How I feel.</i>

52:38.281 --> 52:40.010
- Fuck.
- Brian, stop it.

52:45.288 --> 52:48.223
No. Please. No.

52:48.392 --> 52:50.189
Ain't gonna hurt you.

52:53.697 --> 52:55.028
<i>You sit there...</i>

52:55.198 --> 52:57.428
...with a mass murderer.

52:57.667 --> 52:59.396
A mass murderer.

52:59.569 --> 53:02.766
Your heart rate is jacked.

53:03.840 --> 53:05.569
And your hand...

53:07.244 --> 53:08.643
...steady.

53:11.048 --> 53:15.348
That's one thing I figured out about myself
in prison. My hand...

53:15.519 --> 53:17.714
...does not shake.

53:18.522 --> 53:20.012
Ever.

53:28.865 --> 53:30.992
Wake the fuck up.

53:33.470 --> 53:35.461
There was a cop leaving when I came in.

53:35.872 --> 53:37.840
How did you know he was a cop?

53:38.008 --> 53:42.809
Bad haircut, no dress sense and a slight,
you know, air of scumbag entitlement.

53:42.979 --> 53:45.140
- Do you see cops?
- That's part of what I do.

53:45.315 --> 53:48.512
I normally don't see cadets
who've been kicked out of the academy.

53:48.685 --> 53:51.916
Oh, boy.
You should get a better job, huh?

53:52.789 --> 53:54.450
Should I?

53:54.758 --> 53:58.091
So do they all come in here...

53:58.261 --> 54:00.491
...and cry, your cops?

54:00.997 --> 54:03.966
Sometimes they do. Yeah, sure.
Sometimes they cry, yeah.

54:04.134 --> 54:07.331
If they've had trouble at home,
if they've had to use their weapons...

54:07.504 --> 54:09.631
Use their weapons?

54:10.173 --> 54:11.640
Let me tell you something.

54:11.808 --> 54:14.106
They signed up to use their weapons.

54:14.277 --> 54:16.745
Most of them, all right.
But they watch enough TV...

54:16.913 --> 54:19.814
...so they know they have to weep
after they use their weapons.

54:19.983 --> 54:23.009
There is no one more full of shit
than a cop.

54:23.186 --> 54:24.983
Except for a cop on TV.

54:32.429 --> 54:34.329
<i>I looked at your file.</i>

54:35.966 --> 54:38.025
I see that you have a record of assault.

54:38.201 --> 54:39.725
Yeah.

54:40.003 --> 54:42.028
<i>So what was it like for you in jail?</i>

54:42.439 --> 54:46.671
What, you wanna hear about the showers?
Is that what you wanna hear about?

54:46.843 --> 54:48.674
Did something happen to you?

54:49.045 --> 54:50.478
No.

54:52.682 --> 54:57.142
- Okay, let's do this. Come on, spread them.
- Hey, you think you can pop somebody...

54:57.320 --> 55:00.721
...and there's a special card to play?
Jimmy Bags, whose jaw you broke...

55:00.891 --> 55:03.792
...happens to work undercover
for the Boston Police Department.

55:03.960 --> 55:06.326
I'm going nuts.
I can't be someone else every day.

55:06.496 --> 55:08.088
It's been a year. I've had enough!

55:08.265 --> 55:11.393
Calm down. Most people do it every day.
What's the big deal?

55:11.568 --> 55:14.696
- Well, I'm not them. I'm not them, okay?
- Exactly.

55:14.871 --> 55:17.237
You're nobody.
You signed the papers, remember?

55:17.407 --> 55:20.968
We're the only two people on this earth
that even know you're a cop.

55:21.144 --> 55:23.169
How about we just erase your file, huh?

55:23.346 --> 55:25.109
How about we erase your file...

55:25.282 --> 55:27.716
...and you're just
another soldier for Costello...

55:27.884 --> 55:31.115
...open to arrest for I don't know
how many felonies. What do you say?

55:31.288 --> 55:34.883
How about I fucking kill you, huh?
How about I fucking kill you!

55:35.058 --> 55:37.185
- That was a joke. Come on.
- That wasn't a joke.

55:37.360 --> 55:39.590
You play a tough guy,
doesn't mean you are one...

55:39.763 --> 55:45.133
...you lace-curtain, Irish fucking pussy!
- Hey, hey! Stop it! Break it up! Stop it!

55:45.302 --> 55:49.204
- Fuck you, motherfucker!
- Goddamn it, stop it! That's an order!

55:49.973 --> 55:52.066
For chrissake, be smart.

55:52.242 --> 55:55.541
If anybody's watching us now,
how are we not supposed to arrest you?

55:55.712 --> 55:57.270
Come on, get in the car.

55:57.447 --> 55:59.813
Both of you, get in the car.

56:02.085 --> 56:03.780
When are you gonna take Costello?

56:03.954 --> 56:06.081
What's wrong with taking him
on any one...

56:06.256 --> 56:09.555
...of the million felonies that
you've seen him do or I've seen him do?

56:09.726 --> 56:11.421
I mean, he murdered somebody, right?

56:11.595 --> 56:14.530
The guy fucking murders somebody
and you don't fucking take him!

56:14.698 --> 56:18.395
What are you waiting for? Do you want him
to chop me up and feed me to the poor?

56:18.568 --> 56:20.263
- That what you want?
- That'd stick.

56:20.437 --> 56:22.200
Will you shut up?

56:22.372 --> 56:24.738
We are building a case and it takes time.

56:24.908 --> 56:26.136
You know that.

56:27.444 --> 56:29.309
Something's wrong.

56:30.080 --> 56:31.911
I'm telling you, something's wrong.

56:33.917 --> 56:35.509
Yeah, maybe.

56:36.086 --> 56:38.816
Look, we need you to keep
your ears open, all right?

56:39.256 --> 56:40.985
No bullshit.

56:41.524 --> 56:44.687
I think Costello's got a spy inside
the Special Investigation Unit.

56:47.597 --> 56:49.121
You serious?

56:49.299 --> 56:51.096
I'm afraid so.

56:55.105 --> 56:57.665
Have you heard anything like that?

56:57.841 --> 56:59.502
Jesus Christ.

57:01.711 --> 57:03.542
Hang tight for me, kid.

57:03.713 --> 57:05.510
Just a little while longer.

57:05.682 --> 57:07.980
We are this close:

57:10.053 --> 57:11.782
All right?

57:13.089 --> 57:14.818
<i>What do you expect coming in here?</i>

57:14.991 --> 57:17.789
- I have to come here.
- I know you have to come here.

57:18.361 --> 57:20.886
But now that you're here...

57:21.164 --> 57:22.961
...what do you want?

57:23.366 --> 57:24.799
You want the truth?

57:27.103 --> 57:28.661
Valium.

57:29.005 --> 57:32.133
If you lied, you would have an easier time
getting what you wanted.

57:32.309 --> 57:35.710
- What's that say about what you do?
- We should have a few more meetings...

57:35.879 --> 57:39.576
...before we even talk about prescriptions.
- Look, I'm having panic attacks.

57:39.749 --> 57:44.083
Other night, I thought I was having a heart
attack. I puked in a barrel on the way over.

57:44.254 --> 57:45.846
I haven't slept for fucking weeks.

57:46.022 --> 57:47.546
- Is that true?
- Yeah, that's true.

57:47.724 --> 57:50.420
I said something fucking true.
I want some fucking pills...

57:50.593 --> 57:52.424
...and you're gonna close my file?

57:52.595 --> 57:56.224
- I didn't say I'd close your file. No, I...
- I thought I was supposed to tell...

57:56.399 --> 57:58.993
...the truth here, if only fucking here.
- You are! Yes.

57:59.169 --> 58:03.299
A guy comes in here against every instinct
of privacy, of self-reliance that he has...

58:03.473 --> 58:04.462
...and what do you do?

58:04.641 --> 58:08.702
What do you do? You send him off on the
street to score smack? Is that what you do?

58:09.245 --> 58:11.611
You're fucking ridiculous.

58:19.389 --> 58:21.186
Two pills?

58:22.058 --> 58:24.219
Why don't you just give me
a bottle of Scotch...

58:24.394 --> 58:26.555
...and a handgun
to blow my fucking head off?

58:26.730 --> 58:29.722
- Are we done with this psychiatry bullshit?
- You can leave!

58:29.899 --> 58:32.299
What did I just put myself through?
I'm out of here.

58:32.469 --> 58:36.906
And what if that was a legitimate threat?
Think about it, fucking hotshot.

58:38.274 --> 58:39.901
<i>Fuck.</i>

58:48.618 --> 58:51.280
Why is the last patient of the day
always the hardest one?

58:51.454 --> 58:53.251
You're tired and you don't give a shit.

58:53.423 --> 58:55.323
- It's not supernatural.
- Listen.

58:55.492 --> 59:00.589
Listen. You know, I'm not just somebody
that you have to see or they put you in jail.

59:00.764 --> 59:03.631
Okay? I mean, if you're in distress,
I will help you.

59:05.668 --> 59:07.226
What's this?

59:07.704 --> 59:10.537
It's my card. And a prescription
for 20 lorazepam.

59:10.707 --> 59:12.265
Yeah?

59:12.442 --> 59:14.069
Is it enough to commit suicide?

59:14.644 --> 59:17.135
Maybe it is. All right? Okay?

59:17.313 --> 59:19.474
Have I done my job
up to your goddamn standards?

59:19.649 --> 59:23.380
Because according to my standards,
you fit the model of drug-seeking behavior.

59:23.553 --> 59:27.182
You know, and too damn bad
if you don't like my initial clinical reaction.

59:27.357 --> 59:28.619
Thank you.

59:29.859 --> 59:32.419
I'm transferring you to another counselor.

59:32.595 --> 59:34.586
- Good.
- Okay.

59:36.232 --> 59:38.325
So you wanna get a cup of coffee?

59:45.175 --> 59:48.042
Bring it in here, please.
Would somebody bring it in?

59:48.211 --> 59:49.576
Come on in.

59:50.680 --> 59:54.673
Our target is a major transaction
of microprocessors.

59:54.851 --> 59:56.443
Yes, those.

59:56.619 --> 01:00:00.350
I don't know what they are, you don't know
what they are. Who gives a fuck. Cash.

01:00:00.523 --> 01:00:03.048
Lots of cash is gonna change hands
inside a building...

01:00:03.226 --> 01:00:05.490
...that we have
under AV surveillance close-by.

01:00:05.695 --> 01:00:09.256
I know this location is not the best,
but we had very little time to set up.

01:00:09.432 --> 01:00:11.297
- You guys know anything about this?
- No.

01:00:11.468 --> 01:00:14.528
Sullivan's team will ID the bad guys
and listen in on the phones.

01:00:14.704 --> 01:00:16.069
Our unit will not take action.

01:00:16.706 --> 01:00:20.574
I repeat, not take action, until a man
that Captain Queenan has inside...

01:00:20.743 --> 01:00:22.938
...verifies the transaction. Are we clear?

01:00:23.112 --> 01:00:27.071
Anybody? Any questions? No?
This is who we're after.

01:00:27.917 --> 01:00:30.852
We've been after this cocksucker
for a long time, and tonight...

01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:33.545
...we are going to get him.
Let's go to work.

01:00:33.723 --> 01:00:36.487
All right, you guys find out
what we're doing and get on it.

01:00:36.659 --> 01:00:38.991
Sorry to get you last-minute,
but things leak.

01:00:39.162 --> 01:00:41.187
This lead came from
Queenan's undercover guy.

01:00:41.364 --> 01:00:45.926
I'm gonna smoke. You don't smoke? One of
those fitness freaks, huh? Go fuck yourself.

01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.167
- Hi, Dad?
- Yes.

01:00:53.343 --> 01:00:55.504
<i>Yeah, something big came up at work.</i>

01:00:55.678 --> 01:00:58.169
- I'm not gonna be home for supper.
<i>- Too bad.</i>

01:00:59.015 --> 01:01:00.915
Your mother worked all goddamn day.

01:01:01.217 --> 01:01:04.584
We'll just have to sit down without you
and your friends.

01:01:04.754 --> 01:01:06.915
Oh, no, my friends are still coming.

01:01:10.393 --> 01:01:13.226
So we'll just... I'll just see you
for lunch instead tomorrow.

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:15.893
Your mother will be proud.

01:01:16.065 --> 01:01:17.930
All right, thanks, Pop. Bye.

01:01:18.234 --> 01:01:20.725
The readiness is all.

01:01:21.504 --> 01:01:25.372
You know the players. Call the game.

01:01:27.143 --> 01:01:28.303
Thank you.

01:01:29.546 --> 01:01:31.480
- You ready?
- Is your highness...

01:01:31.648 --> 01:01:34.811
...gonna drop me off at confession
before work, or fuck me, or what?

01:01:34.984 --> 01:01:37.714
What have you got to confess
to that anointed pederast?

01:01:37.887 --> 01:01:40.822
A confessional seal, these days...

01:01:40.990 --> 01:01:42.617
...I'm not so sure.

01:01:47.597 --> 01:01:50.327
He'll operate the cameras.
You ID the guys and log them.

01:01:50.767 --> 01:01:52.997
All cell-phone signals
are under surveillance...

01:01:53.169 --> 01:01:55.933
...through the courtesy of
our federal friends over there.

01:01:58.441 --> 01:02:02.241
Patriot Act, Patriot Act.
I love it, I love it, I love it.

01:02:05.448 --> 01:02:06.608
Keep an eye on this one.

01:02:41.818 --> 01:02:44.048
All right, here we go.

01:02:46.723 --> 01:02:49.021
There's Costello. Mr. French.

01:02:49.292 --> 01:02:51.021
There's Fitzy, Delahunt...

01:02:51.394 --> 01:02:53.225
...and the new guy, Billy Costigan.

01:02:59.802 --> 01:03:02.270
Time is 10:46.

01:03:04.340 --> 01:03:06.399
All right, turn off your cell phones.

01:03:06.576 --> 01:03:09.568
Fitzy's got the chicken.
Check your weapons.

01:03:32.335 --> 01:03:35.361
- We have a blind spot.
- Why do we have a blind spot?

01:03:35.538 --> 01:03:37.438
We had two hours' notice. Two hours.

01:03:37.607 --> 01:03:40.337
- Fuck you think this is, NASA?
- It never crossed my mind.

01:03:40.510 --> 01:03:43.570
- Have you got a camera in the back?
- What back?

01:03:50.319 --> 01:03:52.947
- How you going, Robert?
- Good, Mr. Costello.

01:03:53.356 --> 01:03:56.985
I wanna tell you, at least two
of these gents have machine guns.

01:04:10.707 --> 01:04:13.232
He's from the Chinese government.
He's scared shitless.

01:04:13.676 --> 01:04:16.543
Government man. Scared.

01:04:16.946 --> 01:04:20.643
I'm concerned about a Chinaman
who thinks it's wise...

01:04:20.817 --> 01:04:24.218
...to come to a business transaction...

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:26.283
...with automatic weapons.

01:04:33.129 --> 01:04:36.098
For his own good, tell Bruce Lee
and the Karate Kids...

01:04:36.265 --> 01:04:38.893
...none of us are carrying
automatic weapons.

01:04:39.068 --> 01:04:42.367
Because here, in this country...

01:04:42.805 --> 01:04:45.330
...it don't add inches to your dick.

01:04:45.508 --> 01:04:47.703
You get a life sentence for it.

01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:08.629
If we had some Homeland Security money
like some douche bags I could mention...

01:05:08.798 --> 01:05:10.959
- Any calls?
- They turned off their cell phones.

01:05:11.467 --> 01:05:13.662
Search randomly for calls
made from the area.

01:05:13.836 --> 01:05:16.236
Eight hundred and seven phones
are live in this area.

01:05:16.405 --> 01:05:17.872
Then narrow the area.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.600
What you see there for service
is what you're gonna get.

01:05:20.777 --> 01:05:22.677
Why did they turn their phones off?

01:05:22.845 --> 01:05:25.814
- Wait. There's still one phone up.
- Where?

01:05:37.994 --> 01:05:39.859
The buyers are there.

01:05:43.533 --> 01:05:46.900
You know, direct contact with your guys
would have its advantages.

01:05:47.069 --> 01:05:48.559
Not to my guy.

01:05:49.105 --> 01:05:51.835
This is unbelievable.
Who put the cameras in this place?

01:05:52.208 --> 01:05:53.470
Oh, who the fuck are you?

01:05:54.010 --> 01:05:57.138
I'm the guy who does his job.
You must be the other guy.

01:06:00.283 --> 01:06:03.616
If these Chinks wanna nuke Taiwan
any time in this century...

01:06:03.786 --> 01:06:08.052
...they'd better shape up
and show me 1 million dollars.

01:06:13.196 --> 01:06:16.632
What we generally do, in this country...

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.929
...is one guy...

01:06:19.235 --> 01:06:21.294
...brings the items...

01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:23.768
...and the other guy...

01:06:24.073 --> 01:06:25.370
...pays him.

01:06:29.111 --> 01:06:31.170
No "tickee"...

01:06:31.781 --> 01:06:34.011
...no laundry.

01:06:42.458 --> 01:06:44.551
Go ahead, Fitz.

01:07:00.676 --> 01:07:03.668
Cars are moving,
but did you see anybody come out?

01:07:05.381 --> 01:07:07.440
Please tell me those cars aren't empty.

01:07:07.617 --> 01:07:12.680
I mean, Jesus fucking Christ, please tell me
that those Chinamen's cars aren't empty!

01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:20.195
They didn't figure we had a navy.

01:07:26.035 --> 01:07:28.265
Did you put a camera in the back?

01:07:29.972 --> 01:07:32.202
Can I talk to you for a second, please?

01:07:34.543 --> 01:07:36.773
You stupid fucking hard-on!

01:07:37.613 --> 01:07:39.137
You fucked this whole thing up!

01:07:39.315 --> 01:07:42.580
What the fuck did you do,
you cocksucker? Let go of me!

01:07:42.752 --> 01:07:46.017
I'm gonna rip your fucking arm off
and shove it up your fucking ass!

01:07:46.355 --> 01:07:48.550
Why don't we meet?
Let me buy you an ice cream.

01:07:48.724 --> 01:07:50.954
<i>I'm getting on a plane</i>
<i>unless you put Queenan on.</i>

01:07:51.127 --> 01:07:54.119
Queenan had a funeral to go to.
This is my shift. Calm down.

01:07:54.297 --> 01:07:56.322
Why shouldn't I get
on a fucking plane, huh?

01:07:56.499 --> 01:07:59.127
Meet up? You actually want me dead?

01:07:59.302 --> 01:08:02.135
Look, there is a rat in your unit.
That is a fact, all right?

01:08:02.305 --> 01:08:03.772
<i>- Where's Queenan?</i>
- He's not here.

01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:07.000
They knew you had cameras in the building.
They knew everything.

01:08:07.176 --> 01:08:10.339
There is a leak from the inside.
It's real. Man, smoke him out.

01:08:10.513 --> 01:08:14.540
Yeah, how do we do that, Mr. Genius-Who-
Didn't-Even-Graduate-From-the-Academy?

01:08:14.717 --> 01:08:18.243
Disinform. Let it slip to SIU that you have
a sealed wiretap warrant...

01:08:18.421 --> 01:08:22.881
...for Costello's apartment. Don't tell
anyone in our division, but tell SIU.

01:08:23.059 --> 01:08:25.527
Flush it down the pipe,
see if it comes out on my end.

01:08:25.694 --> 01:08:27.560
That's what we do first. Narrow it down.

01:08:27.729 --> 01:08:30.790
- Where the fuck is Queenan, huh?
<i>- He's not here.</i>

01:08:30.966 --> 01:08:34.060
You wanna meet up
or you got something real, call me back.

01:08:40.076 --> 01:08:43.238
- changing your life radically.

01:08:43.412 --> 01:08:45.812
Change anything. Right?
Change everything.

01:08:45.982 --> 01:08:48.006
- Right?
- Yeah.

01:08:50.920 --> 01:08:53.286
How long you been with this guy?

01:08:54.122 --> 01:08:56.751
- My boyfriend?
- Yeah.

01:08:59.462 --> 01:09:02.658
- Four months. Almost four months.
- Four months.

01:09:02.832 --> 01:09:04.356
Do you love him?

01:09:06.535 --> 01:09:09.002
It's a pretty serious relationship, yeah.

01:09:09.171 --> 01:09:10.536
It's very serious.

01:09:10.706 --> 01:09:14.403
Is he a headcase like me?
I'm just curious.

01:09:15.011 --> 01:09:17.036
No more than I am.

01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:19.671
I know that it's a serious relationship.

01:09:20.316 --> 01:09:22.546
I know there are ups and downs. Right?

01:09:22.718 --> 01:09:25.050
People have doubts and problems.

01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:29.184
Well, not problems, but doubts.

01:09:31.926 --> 01:09:35.693
What would you do if he was standing
right there and he saw us?

01:09:40.703 --> 01:09:44.069
I would lie. Yeah, I would lie.

01:09:44.240 --> 01:09:47.767
You know, to keep things
on an even keel, right?

01:09:47.943 --> 01:09:50.036
Right? We talked about that.

01:09:55.584 --> 01:09:57.552
- Morning.
- Good morning.

01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:00.145
Want a French doughnut?

01:10:00.656 --> 01:10:02.123
Yeah.

01:10:03.559 --> 01:10:05.151
- Hey, can I lookit?
- Yeah.

01:10:05.561 --> 01:10:06.789
Sure.

01:10:09.432 --> 01:10:12.060
- All right, we're not having this out.
- What?

01:10:12.234 --> 01:10:14.395
You don't see any pictures
of where I came from.

01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:16.337
Look, I respect who you are...

01:10:16.505 --> 01:10:18.666
...just, you know, not in the living room.

01:10:18.841 --> 01:10:20.433
We might have company.

01:10:20.609 --> 01:10:22.600
- Company?
- Yeah, company.

01:10:23.345 --> 01:10:26.746
- Hey, now, why do you work for the state?
- Why not? You do.

01:10:26.916 --> 01:10:30.613
No, what you do. The degrees and all,
everything you got. You're hot shit.

01:10:30.986 --> 01:10:31.975
Yeah?

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:34.814
So why do you make as much
as a guidance counselor?

01:10:34.982 --> 01:10:38.509
Because I believe in public service.

01:10:40.288 --> 01:10:43.655
So now you're gonna fuck with me?
So now you're gonna be ridiculous, huh?

01:10:44.425 --> 01:10:46.893
- No, don't start with me. Don't...
- Hey.

01:10:47.628 --> 01:10:50.188
Ah, fuck with the fucking phone! Stop it!

01:10:50.364 --> 01:10:52.059
- The phone.
- Forget the phone.

01:10:52.233 --> 01:10:53.700
Get it. Answer it. Answer it.

01:10:53.968 --> 01:10:56.095
This is your first phone call
in the new house.

01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:58.465
You live here now. You're a resident.

01:11:00.441 --> 01:11:02.170
Mayor Sullivan's office.

01:11:02.343 --> 01:11:05.141
<i>Put Colin on the phone right now.</i>

01:11:05.613 --> 01:11:06.910
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

01:11:07.081 --> 01:11:08.605
What?

01:11:09.083 --> 01:11:11.210
I think it's a guy with...

01:11:11.385 --> 01:11:15.378
- It's like a cancer guy.
- Hello.

01:11:15.556 --> 01:11:18.719
What the fuck is it
with you and your phone, huh?

01:11:20.561 --> 01:11:21.926
Something for work.

01:11:22.096 --> 01:11:25.964
Hey. Nothing, nothing, nothing.
It went dead. I don't know, I get...

01:11:26.167 --> 01:11:28.431
Was that that shrink cunt
that answered the phone?

01:11:28.603 --> 01:11:31.231
Remember I told you that we were...
She was gonna move in?

01:11:31.405 --> 01:11:33.100
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- She moved in.

01:11:33.274 --> 01:11:37.005
- You better get organized, quick.
- Hey, last time I checked, I tipped you off...

01:11:37.178 --> 01:11:39.009
...and you're not in jail.

01:11:39.180 --> 01:11:42.581
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah.

01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:46.481
Do you like Little Miss Thing
sucking on your cock?

01:11:49.190 --> 01:11:50.555
Yes. Yes, I do.

01:11:50.725 --> 01:11:52.352
So earn it.

01:11:53.227 --> 01:11:55.286
I'm getting the feeling...

01:11:55.463 --> 01:11:57.363
...we got a cop in my crew.

01:11:57.665 --> 01:12:00.065
Yeah, I know,
I'm kind of getting that feeling too.

01:12:00.234 --> 01:12:03.032
He's one of yours. Inside.

01:12:03.204 --> 01:12:04.296
<i>Have you seen anything?</i>

01:12:04.472 --> 01:12:08.067
I got no access to Queenan's undercover
files. He and Dignam run the snitches.

01:12:08.242 --> 01:12:09.436
- Doing my best.
<i>- Your best?</i>

01:12:09.610 --> 01:12:12.477
What do you think we're in,
the fucking haberdashery business?

01:12:12.647 --> 01:12:14.205
Look, Frank, if you don't relax...

01:12:14.382 --> 01:12:18.250
If you don't relax, I can't relax. All right?
Now, what I need you to do...

01:12:18.419 --> 01:12:21.877
<i>...get me information on the people</i>
<i>with you last night. Your crew.</i>

01:12:22.056 --> 01:12:23.990
Get me social-security numbers, get me...

01:12:24.158 --> 01:12:28.322
Get you? Give you?
Who the fuck do you work for?

01:12:28.496 --> 01:12:31.761
All right, all right. Frank, Frank, Frank.
All right. I'm sorry.

01:12:31.933 --> 01:12:35.130
If you could, please.
What I need are SS numbers, DOBs...

01:12:35.303 --> 01:12:39.831
...just all the pedigree information so I can
run it on my end and we can ID the prick.

01:12:40.007 --> 01:12:41.804
<i>If you can get me that information...</i>

01:12:41.976 --> 01:12:44.410
...I can... We're gonna handle it.
I can handle it.

01:12:44.578 --> 01:12:46.773
Calm down, or you'll shoot in your pants.

01:12:46.948 --> 01:12:48.677
<i>I'll get you the records and whatnot.</i>

01:12:48.849 --> 01:12:52.012
<i>But listen to me, son.</i>
<i>Don't disappoint me on this...</i>

01:12:52.186 --> 01:12:55.485
...or some other guy will be putting
their fat cock...

01:12:55.656 --> 01:12:58.147
...up Little Miss Freud's ass.

01:13:04.966 --> 01:13:07.332
How are you, Francis?

01:13:12.506 --> 01:13:15.998
- My mother called me Francis.
- I know she did.

01:13:16.177 --> 01:13:18.975
And your father called you the tumor.

01:13:19.146 --> 01:13:21.808
And what did your father
call you, Charlie?

01:13:21.983 --> 01:13:25.976
Oh, yeah, I forgot. He wasn't around.

01:13:26.153 --> 01:13:28.280
You have a boss
that has a laryngectomy?

01:13:28.456 --> 01:13:32.358
No, no, no. That was a guy
who works for me.

01:13:32.526 --> 01:13:34.517
You're lying to me.

01:13:36.297 --> 01:13:37.662
Not exactly.

01:13:37.832 --> 01:13:41.290
What did you do with
the real microprocessors, Frank?

01:13:41.736 --> 01:13:44.432
Microprocessors.

01:13:44.939 --> 01:13:46.167
Oh, yeah.

01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:49.503
I heard the story. You arrested
some Chinese government guys...

01:13:49.677 --> 01:13:53.010
...at the border carrying some light sockets
or something.

01:13:54.715 --> 01:13:57.548
I can't wait to wipe that fucking smirk
off of your face.

01:13:58.219 --> 01:14:00.881
Wouldn't you rather wipe my ass for me?

01:14:01.055 --> 01:14:05.014
There are certain parts of my job that
I'm not gonna be able to talk to you about.

01:14:05.393 --> 01:14:10.160
And I cannot allow you to jeopardize
an ongoing investigation...

01:14:10.331 --> 01:14:12.356
...or your life.

01:14:13.334 --> 01:14:16.326
No, really, there are things
you don't even wanna know about.

01:14:16.971 --> 01:14:18.700
Okay, then just say that.

01:14:20.788 --> 01:14:22.153
All right, I will.

01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:24.951
Oh, that's the movers.

01:14:25.126 --> 01:14:26.889
Yeah, you still wanna stay?

01:14:27.862 --> 01:14:30.023
- Yes.
- Yeah?

01:14:30.198 --> 01:14:33.827
Come on, I'm coming!
It's the worst timing.

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:36.237
I'm gonna get you.

01:14:37.438 --> 01:14:40.271
If you could've, you would've.

01:14:40.542 --> 01:14:44.103
But I guess you like to go
at your own pace.

01:14:44.279 --> 01:14:48.648
Excuse me. Got a date with some angels.

01:14:56.691 --> 01:14:57.680
<i>Frankie.</i>

01:14:58.626 --> 01:15:00.093
<i>Frankie!</i>

01:15:00.962 --> 01:15:03.055
<i>Your mother forgives me.</i>

01:15:07.835 --> 01:15:09.700
You take off an armored car at the mall.

01:15:09.871 --> 01:15:11.896
What the fuck,
you pay guineas in Providence?

01:15:12.073 --> 01:15:14.906
- Fucking now I do!
- What the fuck do you do?

01:15:15.076 --> 01:15:19.479
I gotta pay Costello for him to trade me
to the FBI? Because that's what he does.

01:15:19.647 --> 01:15:22.138
FBI? What the fuck
you talking about, FBI?

01:15:25.587 --> 01:15:27.111
My God, is that French out there?

01:15:27.288 --> 01:15:29.449
What the fuck did you just say
about the FBI?

01:15:29.624 --> 01:15:31.558
Forget what I said. I'm fucking high.

01:15:32.226 --> 01:15:34.717
Whatever may be going on
in that very fucking poor...

01:15:34.896 --> 01:15:38.662
...very limited brain of yours,
I am not gonna hurt you, all right?

01:15:38.933 --> 01:15:41.094
- Just tell me what you fucking said.
- Forget it.

01:15:41.269 --> 01:15:45.171
I'm high. I'm fucking high. I must be high.
I'd never say what you thought I said.

01:15:46.007 --> 01:15:46.996
Fuck!

01:15:47.175 --> 01:15:50.474
Now, what the fuck
did you just fucking say?

01:15:50.645 --> 01:15:54.604
Why do you think he never gets busted?
Costello's a protected FBI informant.

01:15:54.782 --> 01:15:57.273
He'll trade you out.

01:15:57.652 --> 01:16:00.348
I thought
I was supposed to go into shock.

01:16:00.521 --> 01:16:03.615
I'm not in shock. It fucking hurts!

01:16:03.791 --> 01:16:06.783
It fucking hurts!

01:16:14.302 --> 01:16:16.532
Hey. It's me.

01:16:16.704 --> 01:16:19.036
- What are you doing here?
- Come here.

01:16:21.242 --> 01:16:24.006
Costello's giving people up to the FBI.

01:16:24.178 --> 01:16:28.478
- The FBI?
- He is giving information to the FBI.

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:31.016
He's a protected fucking informant.

01:16:31.185 --> 01:16:35.417
I mean, aren't they always trying to make it
a federal case and it never gets made?

01:16:36.591 --> 01:16:39.219
Go around the back.
I'll open the door. Go on.

01:16:42.930 --> 01:16:46.297
- Here's some ice water.
- Oh, thanks. Thanks.

01:16:51.372 --> 01:16:53.067
That's my son, Patrick.

01:16:53.374 --> 01:16:56.502
- Goes to Notre Dame.
- Oh, yeah?

01:16:56.678 --> 01:17:00.045
My wife's asleep but she left some
supper out. You want something to eat?

01:17:00.214 --> 01:17:01.704
No. No, thanks.

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:05.478
Yeah, come on, man. You have
some supper. We'll talk in the kitchen.

01:17:05.653 --> 01:17:07.280
Come on.

01:17:42.824 --> 01:17:44.052
You want some coke?

01:17:49.597 --> 01:17:51.497
There it is.

01:17:52.133 --> 01:17:54.624
Don't move till you're numb.

01:18:09.650 --> 01:18:11.584
Come on. Get inside.

01:18:13.921 --> 01:18:15.752
Boss wants your real name...

01:18:16.457 --> 01:18:19.449
...your social and license number,
your bank account numbers.

01:18:19.627 --> 01:18:21.720
I don't have a bank account.

01:18:21.896 --> 01:18:25.093
- I'm a cash business myself.
- What's he doing, setting up IRAs?

01:18:25.266 --> 01:18:29.202
Just fill the fucking paper in. Your real name
and all your account numbers.

01:18:29.370 --> 01:18:31.201
Then we wait here.

01:18:32.039 --> 01:18:34.769
- You're shitting me.
- No, I ain't.

01:18:46.154 --> 01:18:48.281
Put the forms in there.

01:18:51.793 --> 01:18:54.159
I don't know if this
is how you spell "citizens."

01:18:54.328 --> 01:18:56.990
But fuck it, you know?

01:18:57.498 --> 01:18:59.966
No, no, no. Come here.

01:19:04.939 --> 01:19:06.930
What, are you fucking retarded
or something?

01:19:07.108 --> 01:19:09.269
That ain't fucking right.

01:19:09.443 --> 01:19:10.705
Are you kidding me?

01:19:10.878 --> 01:19:12.175
Look at this. Look.

01:19:12.947 --> 01:19:14.938
"Citizens." Look.

01:19:15.283 --> 01:19:16.614
Billy, he said to stay here.

01:19:16.984 --> 01:19:19.509
Yeah. I'm not sitting here
without a tetanus shot.

01:19:19.687 --> 01:19:21.052
Where the fuck are you going?

01:19:21.222 --> 01:19:25.386
I'm not staying, all right?
You can tell him I said that.

01:19:44.712 --> 01:19:46.737
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:19:48.783 --> 01:19:50.842
- It's pouring out there.
- Yeah.

01:19:57.758 --> 01:19:59.623
Look...

01:19:59.794 --> 01:20:01.557
...if this is inappropriate, I...
- No.

01:20:01.729 --> 01:20:04.357
No, it's not inappropriate.
You're not a patient.

01:20:07.201 --> 01:20:09.169
So you moving out or you moving in?

01:20:09.937 --> 01:20:12.098
I've still got
three weeks left on the lease.

01:20:21.282 --> 01:20:22.943
That's me.

01:20:26.020 --> 01:20:27.510
Yeah, I know.

01:20:33.594 --> 01:20:37.291
- Hedging your bets?
- No. No.

01:20:37.665 --> 01:20:39.064
You have to choose.

01:20:39.233 --> 01:20:41.895
- You have to make a...
- A decision.

01:20:42.069 --> 01:20:45.470
A decision. And, you know, you have to
stick by what you choose.

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:47.904
- You have to...
- Move in with your boyfriend?

01:20:48.075 --> 01:20:50.669
Yes. Otherwise it's...

01:20:51.612 --> 01:20:54.513
Oh, I know, I know. I know.

01:21:05.326 --> 01:21:10.559
I have to say your vulnerability
is really freaking me out right now.

01:21:15.770 --> 01:21:17.431
Is it real?

01:21:21.342 --> 01:21:23.071
I think so.

01:21:28.983 --> 01:21:30.848
You don't have any cats.

01:21:31.018 --> 01:21:32.576
No.

01:21:33.554 --> 01:21:35.317
I like that.

01:22:47.628 --> 01:22:48.822
I don't get it.

01:22:51.732 --> 01:22:54.360
We are all convinced
that Costello has at least...

01:22:54.535 --> 01:22:57.698
...one mole inside
the Special Investigations Unit.

01:22:57.872 --> 01:23:02.104
You will investigate everybody
and anybody.

01:23:02.276 --> 01:23:06.440
Well, that's not exactly
a dream job for a cop.

01:23:06.614 --> 01:23:09.879
We looked at all possible candidates.
You have an immaculate record.

01:23:10.051 --> 01:23:13.384
Some people don't trust a guy
with an immaculate record. I do.

01:23:13.554 --> 01:23:15.021
I have an immaculate record.

01:23:16.290 --> 01:23:18.155
How is your wedding coming along?

01:23:18.325 --> 01:23:20.759
Great. Great. She's a doctor.

01:23:21.295 --> 01:23:23.695
- That's outstanding.
- Yeah.

01:23:23.864 --> 01:23:25.991
Marriage is an important part
of getting ahead.

01:23:26.167 --> 01:23:29.068
Lets people know you're not a homo.
Married guy is more stable.

01:23:29.236 --> 01:23:31.898
People see the ring, think at least
someone can stand him.

01:23:32.073 --> 01:23:36.134
Ladies see the ring, they know you must
have some cash and your cock must work.

01:23:36.944 --> 01:23:39.378
Yeah, it's working. Overtime.

01:23:39.814 --> 01:23:42.544
- I'm glad to hear that.
- Thank you.

01:24:30.631 --> 01:24:34.294
Be dirty, be dirty.

01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:38.665
Yeah...

01:24:43.878 --> 01:24:46.608
Frank. The fuck is wrong with you?

01:24:47.481 --> 01:24:50.507
- See anything you like, Col?
- I almost fucking shot you.

01:24:50.684 --> 01:24:53.585
- You're not indulging in self-abuse, are you?
- Sit down.

01:24:53.754 --> 01:24:57.815
I hope you're not turning into one of them
sob sisters wants to get caught.

01:24:58.192 --> 01:24:59.887
You're not cracking up, are you?

01:25:00.828 --> 01:25:03.388
- I don't crack up.
- Pick a place like this...

01:25:03.564 --> 01:25:05.464
...where any cop could see you. Jesus.

01:25:05.633 --> 01:25:08.796
If this is such a fucking bad idea
why'd you show up?

01:25:09.403 --> 01:25:11.064
I own the place.

01:25:13.374 --> 01:25:15.968
Why am I not fucking surprised?

01:25:17.311 --> 01:25:21.042
- All right, lookit, I gotta tell you...
- You're getting reassigned. I know.

01:25:21.749 --> 01:25:23.216
How the fuck do you know that?

01:25:23.384 --> 01:25:25.682
- Where'd they put you?
- Hey, Frank.

01:25:25.853 --> 01:25:29.414
I gotta find myself.

01:25:29.590 --> 01:25:31.182
You're telling me, sonny boy.

01:25:31.792 --> 01:25:34.192
I gotta find the guy
you got in the department.

01:25:34.929 --> 01:25:38.558
With everybody looking up their own ass
and you looking for yourself...

01:25:38.732 --> 01:25:40.791
...I put my money
on nobody finds nothing.

01:25:40.968 --> 01:25:45.405
I know, but, Frank, lookit.
For me, you gotta lay low.

01:25:45.573 --> 01:25:47.404
- Right now.
- Collie...

01:25:47.575 --> 01:25:49.975
...laying low is not what I do.

01:25:50.144 --> 01:25:52.806
All right, fucking Big Daddy Frank.
Fucking perfect.

01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:55.210
What good am I to you
if you don't listen to me?

01:25:55.382 --> 01:25:56.974
What good am I if you don't listen?

01:26:02.122 --> 01:26:04.920
Queenan is compartmentalizing.
He's splitting everything up.

01:26:05.092 --> 01:26:06.753
He's fucking smart. You know this.

01:26:06.927 --> 01:26:10.522
I can get the rat. You just gotta
let me do it my way, Frank.

01:26:14.068 --> 01:26:15.228
Okay.

01:26:19.073 --> 01:26:21.940
But Colin,
I hope I won't have to remind you...

01:26:22.109 --> 01:26:26.136
...that if you don't find that cheese-eating
rat bastard in your department...

01:26:26.313 --> 01:26:30.545
...most likely,
it won't be me who suffers for it.

01:26:31.485 --> 01:26:33.976
Now, why would you have to
remind me of that?

01:26:34.154 --> 01:26:39.319
Would I be any good at what I do
if I didn't fucking already know that?

01:26:39.493 --> 01:26:41.927
Frank, you gotta trust me.

01:26:42.463 --> 01:26:44.829
All right? Just trust me, Frank.

01:26:46.066 --> 01:26:50.628
Hey, it fucking involves lying
and I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?

01:26:50.804 --> 01:26:52.465
Right?

01:26:52.640 --> 01:26:55.268
Maybe because
it's always been so easy...

01:26:55.442 --> 01:27:00.072
...for me to get cunt that I never understood
jerking off in a theater.

01:27:06.587 --> 01:27:08.145
Christ.

01:27:10.291 --> 01:27:12.816
Who knows what's easy?

01:27:13.594 --> 01:27:18.258
Colin, I know you'll take care
of business.

01:28:03.010 --> 01:28:04.477
Shit!

01:28:43.384 --> 01:28:44.817
Fuck.

01:30:02.963 --> 01:30:04.453
Hey, how you doing?

01:30:04.631 --> 01:30:06.792
Hi, Darlene, hi.

01:30:10.971 --> 01:30:12.836
- That's it for me.
- Yeah, see you.

01:30:13.006 --> 01:30:14.701
Have a good one.

01:30:37.831 --> 01:30:39.992
I smell a rat.

01:30:46.640 --> 01:30:47.868
Jesus Christ.

01:30:48.942 --> 01:30:50.534
You got a girlfriend?

01:30:52.479 --> 01:30:54.140
No.

01:30:54.314 --> 01:30:56.373
No, no. Why, what does that matter?

01:30:58.118 --> 01:30:59.483
It depends.

01:31:01.688 --> 01:31:05.317
I'm sure by now you know...

01:31:05.926 --> 01:31:09.054
...I got an informer in my outfit.

01:31:10.030 --> 01:31:11.258
Cop.

01:31:11.431 --> 01:31:16.698
Staties, Boston Police Department,
I'm not sure.

01:31:16.870 --> 01:31:19.031
Jesus Christ.

01:31:20.641 --> 01:31:23.269
Are you sure it's not the FBI?

01:31:24.745 --> 01:31:27.612
It ain't the FBI.

01:31:28.649 --> 01:31:30.583
Ex-wife.

01:31:31.885 --> 01:31:33.944
Old girlfriend.

01:31:35.322 --> 01:31:37.256
Or stupid.

01:31:38.425 --> 01:31:41.792
That is what brings you down
in this business.

01:31:41.962 --> 01:31:43.657
Stupid, huh?

01:31:44.331 --> 01:31:46.231
Well, I guess that leaves me out.

01:31:50.470 --> 01:31:55.840
You know, past days, situation like this,
I kill everybody.

01:31:56.577 --> 01:31:59.011
Everybody who works for me.

01:31:59.479 --> 01:32:01.777
Right. You know, Frank...

01:32:01.949 --> 01:32:04.042
...I look around at your other guys...

01:32:04.851 --> 01:32:07.786
I mean, they're all murderers, right?
Right?

01:32:08.455 --> 01:32:11.618
And I think, "Could I do murder?"

01:32:13.694 --> 01:32:16.857
And all I can answer myself is:

01:32:18.365 --> 01:32:20.390
"What's the difference?"

01:32:21.134 --> 01:32:23.466
Give them up to the Almighty.

01:32:24.004 --> 01:32:26.700
You see, that's my point, you know?

01:32:27.474 --> 01:32:31.968
You accuse me once, I put up with it.

01:32:32.145 --> 01:32:33.476
You accuse me twice...

01:32:35.115 --> 01:32:37.015
...I quit.

01:32:37.618 --> 01:32:42.021
You pressure me to fear for my life and
I will put a fucking bullet in your head...

01:32:42.189 --> 01:32:45.124
...as if you were anybody else. Okay?

01:32:56.269 --> 01:32:59.932
You got something
you wanna ask me?

01:33:02.075 --> 01:33:06.102
Look, you're 70 years old, Frank.
I'm just saying, okay?

01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:09.278
One of your guys is gonna pop you.

01:33:09.449 --> 01:33:11.781
- One of your guys is gonna pop you.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:33:11.952 --> 01:33:14.250
As for running drugs,
what the fuck are you doing?

01:33:14.421 --> 01:33:18.016
You don't need the money or the pain
in the ass. And they will catch you.

01:33:18.191 --> 01:33:20.318
I haven't needed the money...

01:33:20.494 --> 01:33:24.624
...since I took Archie's milk money
in the third grade.

01:33:24.798 --> 01:33:28.063
Tell you the truth,
I don't need pussy anymore, either.

01:33:29.536 --> 01:33:31.367
But I like it.

01:33:32.539 --> 01:33:35.303
Point I'm making here is, Bill...

01:33:35.475 --> 01:33:38.308
...I got this rat...

01:33:38.478 --> 01:33:42.778
...this gnawing,
cheese-eating, fucking rat...

01:33:42.949 --> 01:33:45.349
...and it brings up questions.

01:33:45.519 --> 01:33:49.512
You know. See, Bill, like,
you're the new guy.

01:33:50.757 --> 01:33:52.588
Girlfriend...

01:33:54.428 --> 01:33:59.297
Why don't you stay in the bar
that night I got your numbers?

01:34:00.067 --> 01:34:02.729
Social-security numbers.

01:34:02.903 --> 01:34:05.838
- Yeah.
- Everybody's fucking numbers.

01:34:06.006 --> 01:34:08.804
Is there something that
you just wanna go ahead and ask me?

01:34:08.975 --> 01:34:11.375
Because I'll give you
the fucking answer, all right?

01:34:11.545 --> 01:34:13.479
Frank, look at me. Look at me.

01:34:13.647 --> 01:34:16.946
I'm not the fucking rat. Okay?

01:34:17.117 --> 01:34:18.516
I'm not the fucking rat.

01:34:19.619 --> 01:34:21.951
Start with you agree there is a rat.

01:34:22.856 --> 01:34:24.380
You said there is one, all right?

01:34:24.558 --> 01:34:28.085
I base most of what I do on the idea
that you're pretty good at what you do.

01:34:28.261 --> 01:34:30.354
Sure. Sure, Will.

01:34:30.530 --> 01:34:35.024
You, William. What would you do?

01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:41.564
Frank, how many of these guys...

01:34:41.742 --> 01:34:44.142
...have been with you
long enough to be disgruntled?

01:34:44.311 --> 01:34:47.280
Think about it.
You don't pay much, you know.

01:34:47.447 --> 01:34:50.416
It's almost a fucking feudal enterprise.

01:34:50.584 --> 01:34:54.111
The question is,
and this is the only question...

01:34:54.955 --> 01:34:59.449
...who thinks that they can do what you do
better than you?

01:35:00.393 --> 01:35:03.556
The only one
who could do what I do is me.

01:35:04.831 --> 01:35:08.267
Lot of people had to die
for me to be me.

01:35:10.771 --> 01:35:12.796
You wanna be me?

01:35:16.510 --> 01:35:19.172
I probably could be you. Yeah.

01:35:19.346 --> 01:35:20.836
Yeah, I know that much.

01:35:22.149 --> 01:35:25.209
But I don't wanna be you, Frank.

01:35:25.385 --> 01:35:27.649
I don't wanna be you.

01:35:28.655 --> 01:35:33.592
"Heavy lies the crown" sort of thing.

01:35:34.094 --> 01:35:35.527
Yeah.

01:35:36.363 --> 01:35:38.831
- Francis.
- I'm out of here. You'll set the alarm...

01:35:38.999 --> 01:35:43.095
- Yeah, all right. I'll see you at Christmas.
- All right. Good night.

01:35:45.605 --> 01:35:48.472
You know what I like about restaurants?

01:35:48.642 --> 01:35:50.507
The fucking food? I don't know. What?

01:35:51.011 --> 01:35:54.913
You learn a lot watching things eat.

01:35:57.150 --> 01:35:59.482
There's a boat coming up Gloucester.

01:36:00.453 --> 01:36:03.286
French will give you all the details.
Don't forget.

01:36:03.456 --> 01:36:06.619
Eat something, for Christ's sake.

01:36:10.797 --> 01:36:16.030
In the future, I tell you to do a thing,
you fucking do it. You got that?

01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:19.134
I got it. Okay?

01:36:21.508 --> 01:36:23.066
Excuse me...

01:36:23.243 --> 01:36:25.905
...French, I forgot my...
- Okay, Francis.

01:36:26.079 --> 01:36:27.068
...cigarette.

01:36:30.050 --> 01:36:32.382
Eat something.

01:36:41.027 --> 01:36:42.016
Problem?

01:36:42.195 --> 01:36:45.722
Yeah, I got a problem. I run rat fucks
like you, okay? I don't like them.

01:36:45.899 --> 01:36:48.231
The day you wouldn't take a promotion,
let me know.

01:36:48.401 --> 01:36:50.528
If you'd taken care of this
I wouldn't be here.

01:36:50.704 --> 01:36:54.231
- Fuck yourself, you piece of shit.
- I need the identity of your undercovers.

01:36:54.407 --> 01:36:57.968
Blow me. Not literally. Unfortunately,
there's no promotion involved for you.

01:36:58.144 --> 01:36:59.133
Fucking prick.

01:36:59.546 --> 01:37:02.538
- Hi, captain.
- Look who's here. The prom queen.

01:37:02.716 --> 01:37:05.048
- They are not happy with me.
- What do you expect?

01:37:05.385 --> 01:37:08.718
Everybody knows you've been assigned here
to find Costello's rat.

01:37:09.489 --> 01:37:12.083
They want to find the leak
as much as you do.

01:37:12.559 --> 01:37:16.620
Like I said, two days ago, my guy
damn near found out who Costello's rat is.

01:37:18.365 --> 01:37:21.266
- But he lost him in the streets.
- Really?

01:37:23.603 --> 01:37:26.868
- Well, did he get a look at the guy?
- No.

01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:29.804
I mean, nothing? Like, I mean,
anything that could help us.

01:37:29.976 --> 01:37:31.204
No.

01:37:33.680 --> 01:37:36.581
So you got any advice for me?
Just, I mean, generally.

01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:41.047
Costello can't do much business without
coordinating with his source...

01:37:41.221 --> 01:37:43.086
...who is here in SIU.

01:37:44.858 --> 01:37:47.224
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

01:37:54.868 --> 01:37:57.496
<i>You're gonna be looking at my people...</i>

01:37:57.704 --> 01:38:01.936
<i>...going through their bank statements,</i>
<i>their phone calls and medical records.</i>

01:38:02.108 --> 01:38:06.909
<i>Don't be surprised if they don't buy you</i>
<i>a beer or invite you into their homes.</i>

01:38:08.348 --> 01:38:10.339
<i>Let me get you a coffee.</i>

01:38:13.286 --> 01:38:16.517
<i>If I wasn't</i>
<i>with the Massachusetts State Police...</i>

01:38:17.157 --> 01:38:20.092
...if I did it full-time, law school...

01:38:20.694 --> 01:38:22.855
...I'd be through it in a year.

01:38:24.164 --> 01:38:26.064
If I wasn't a trooper.

01:38:30.370 --> 01:38:33.203
But another city. I was thinking that.

01:38:34.441 --> 01:38:36.170
Another city.

01:38:36.409 --> 01:38:38.741
Another city, huh?

01:38:40.246 --> 01:38:43.374
Yeah, well, that would be a clean slate.

01:38:43.917 --> 01:38:47.182
<i>I want you to know,</i>
<i>you don't got to stay.</i>

01:38:49.522 --> 01:38:51.319
If we're not gonna make it...

01:38:51.491 --> 01:38:55.951
...it's gotta be you that gets out,
because I'm not capable.

01:38:57.263 --> 01:39:01.597
I'm fucking Irish. I'll deal with something
being wrong for the rest of my life.

01:39:10.377 --> 01:39:14.211
<i>It might not be a bad idea,</i>
<i>you know, another city.</i>

01:39:32.465 --> 01:39:35.229
- Of course I know how to spot a cop.
- How's that?

01:39:35.402 --> 01:39:38.428
If he's not paying attention to us,
he's a cop.

01:39:38.605 --> 01:39:41.870
Lookit. You see that guy over there?
Right over there.

01:39:42.042 --> 01:39:43.031
Yeah.

01:39:43.209 --> 01:39:46.906
Not paying attention to us.
He's a cop.

01:39:47.547 --> 01:39:50.380
- Okay.
- You get it now, do you?

01:39:56.322 --> 01:39:58.290
- What about this guy?
- Cop.

01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:03.590
Hey, how you doing?
What kind of dog is that?

01:40:05.365 --> 01:40:07.697
She ignored us so she must be a cop.

01:40:07.867 --> 01:40:10.165
She's probably
the fucking police commissioner.

01:40:21.681 --> 01:40:25.708
You can get out of here. I'm using
a new crew tonight. New guys.

01:40:27.454 --> 01:40:32.084
- I thought I was on for this.
- I changed my mind. Take the night off.

01:40:32.258 --> 01:40:36.456
Francis, we're ready for the sushi bar.

01:40:37.230 --> 01:40:39.790
- Jimmy, bring a mop.
- Out the back.

01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:42.893
There's guys who answer
the questions right...

01:40:43.069 --> 01:40:45.367
...and there's guys that don't.
- And a pail.

01:40:47.774 --> 01:40:49.401
You're a cop.

01:40:49.876 --> 01:40:51.207
What?

01:40:51.377 --> 01:40:53.504
You ignored us, you're a cop.

01:40:54.547 --> 01:40:58.278
We're guessing who cops are. You know,
most good-looking women are cops.

01:40:59.719 --> 01:41:02.847
Well, I'm going home, all right?
He's playing with his new guys.

01:41:03.022 --> 01:41:04.956
- See you later, all right?
- See you later.

01:41:11.798 --> 01:41:14.858
He's moving something with all new guys.
A whole new crew.

01:41:15.034 --> 01:41:18.231
No, no, I can't tell you what or where.
It's probably disinformation.

01:41:18.404 --> 01:41:21.703
Just keep following him, all right?
Listen, I need to see you today.

01:41:21.875 --> 01:41:23.308
<i>- Tomorrow.</i>
- No, no, no. Today.

01:41:23.476 --> 01:41:25.842
- You heard nothing about drugs?
<i>- No.</i>

01:41:26.012 --> 01:41:29.470
Nothing about new guys?
Nothing about Gloucester?

01:41:29.649 --> 01:41:33.415
Not a thing. And I would have.
That information would have come to me.

01:41:35.288 --> 01:41:36.915
It ain't Bill.

01:41:37.090 --> 01:41:38.853
No way, he says.

01:41:51.371 --> 01:41:53.737
Follow Costello. You'll find his rat.

01:41:53.907 --> 01:41:55.431
Yeah, this is Sergeant Sullivan.

01:41:55.608 --> 01:42:00.011
I want constant surveillance
on Captain Queenan, starting right now.

01:42:01.047 --> 01:42:02.742
Good. Thank you.

01:42:05.585 --> 01:42:09.521
Can I ask a question, sarge? Why the fuck
are we following Captain Queenan?

01:42:09.689 --> 01:42:11.589
To find out about the good Catholic life?

01:42:11.758 --> 01:42:14.921
I have to follow every lead,
however unlikely...

01:42:15.094 --> 01:42:18.860
...however fucking painful it might be
to your delicate fucking sensibilities.

01:42:19.032 --> 01:42:21.023
Who told you I had delicate sensibilities?

01:42:21.201 --> 01:42:24.728
<i>- I just don't like it, sarge. Don't feel right.</i>
- I have reason to believe...

01:42:24.904 --> 01:42:27.634
...that Captain Queenan is Costello's rat.

01:42:27.807 --> 01:42:30.105
So just follow him and don't get made.

01:42:33.446 --> 01:42:36.313
Sarge, we got the target coming out.

01:43:12.785 --> 01:43:14.013
Hey. Where are you?

01:43:14.187 --> 01:43:16.155
<i>Look down the car.</i>

01:43:17.557 --> 01:43:20.025
<i>- You got me?</i>
- Yeah, I gotcha.

01:43:20.193 --> 01:43:22.058
Is there a reason you would have a tail?

01:43:22.562 --> 01:43:23.961
No.

01:43:25.598 --> 01:43:28.431
- Because I think...
- Billy, I don't have a tail.

01:43:29.769 --> 01:43:33.398
Get off at the next stop, all right?
South Station. You wait there 10 minutes.

01:43:33.573 --> 01:43:35.837
South Station. Wait 10 minutes.

01:44:11.778 --> 01:44:14.975
He just went into a building
down the waterfront. 344 Wash.

01:44:15.148 --> 01:44:17.673
You got that? 344 Wash.

01:44:21.854 --> 01:44:23.481
Yeah, he went up to the top floor.

01:44:28.061 --> 01:44:30.723
Building's empty. No tenants here.

01:44:32.231 --> 01:44:35.530
He's got dope coming in.
I don't know where. He...

01:44:36.369 --> 01:44:37.859
He's getting spooky, captain.

01:44:38.037 --> 01:44:39.163
- What?
- I just saw him.

01:44:39.339 --> 01:44:41.864
He had blood on his hands.
He's lost his fucking mind.

01:44:48.448 --> 01:44:50.882
I don't know
what we're doing here, boys.

01:44:51.517 --> 01:44:54.486
He's not including his regular guys.
But I'll tell you something.

01:44:54.654 --> 01:44:58.181
Sooner or later he's gonna find out
who I am and he's gonna fucking kill me.

01:44:58.358 --> 01:45:00.690
- I know it. He's gonna fucking kill me!
- All right!

01:45:07.533 --> 01:45:10.502
I think we got him. I think Queenan's
meeting with him right now.

01:45:10.670 --> 01:45:12.365
All right, all right. Listen to me.

01:45:12.538 --> 01:45:15.336
I'm really sorry for your trouble.
I swear to God I am.

01:45:15.508 --> 01:45:18.773
I'll get you out of this. I can't
do it overnight but I'll get you out.

01:45:19.846 --> 01:45:20.904
Yeah?

01:45:21.080 --> 01:45:23.776
Hey, get the van. We're moving.
Heavy work.

01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:26.282
- What about the FBI?
- They're compromised.

01:45:26.452 --> 01:45:27.885
- They're what?
- They're fucked.

01:45:31.924 --> 01:45:33.084
- Yeah.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

01:45:33.259 --> 01:45:35.557
We've been trying to reach you.
We found the rat.

01:45:36.028 --> 01:45:38.019
<i>Listen, we're gonna take him out.</i>
<i>Lookit:</i>

01:45:38.197 --> 01:45:40.791
The address is 314 Washington Street.
You got it?

01:45:40.967 --> 01:45:42.400
All right, we'll see you there.

01:45:42.935 --> 01:45:44.163
- What?
- You were followed.

01:45:44.337 --> 01:45:45.929
- By who?
- By Costello's people.

01:45:46.105 --> 01:45:47.538
- Impossible.
- One of the cops...

01:45:47.707 --> 01:45:50.437
...he's got on the inside tipped him.
Come on. Come on.

01:45:51.411 --> 01:45:52.935
Come on!

01:45:59.585 --> 01:46:02.053
What the fuck is going on?

01:46:03.156 --> 01:46:05.989
Fucking shit. Looks like Queenan's
meeting with all of them.

01:46:06.893 --> 01:46:09.327
Yeah, he must be our guy.

01:46:09.495 --> 01:46:12.794
<i>Sarge, we gotta get him out of here.</i>
<i>Those guys aren't fucking around.</i>

01:46:17.737 --> 01:46:20.570
Ah, Christ, it's too late.
Let's go back up.

01:46:24.644 --> 01:46:26.441
- Shit!
- You got to get out of here!

01:46:26.612 --> 01:46:28.443
- Take the fire escape.
- What about you?

01:46:28.614 --> 01:46:31.640
I'll be fine. But if you get made
I can't protect you. Now, go!

01:46:49.268 --> 01:46:51.828
- One of you mugs got a light?
- Where's your boy?

01:46:52.004 --> 01:46:55.030
- He's studying law at Notre Dame.
- Where's your fucking boy?

01:46:55.208 --> 01:46:57.301
- Hey! Hey!
- Goddamn motherfucker!

01:46:57.477 --> 01:46:59.502
- Fucking kill you!
- Where's your fucking boy?

01:47:15.828 --> 01:47:18.820
What the fuck was that?
Did you fucking see that?

01:47:23.169 --> 01:47:25.194
Sarge, something
just came off the building.

01:47:26.005 --> 01:47:28.064
What the fuck?

01:47:31.143 --> 01:47:32.132
Fuck.

01:47:32.311 --> 01:47:34.211
What do you mean,
off the building?

01:47:34.380 --> 01:47:37.076
- Something came off the fucking roof.
- It's a fucking body.

01:47:45.791 --> 01:47:47.691
We can't get a visual.
Want us to get out?

01:47:47.860 --> 01:47:50.624
We gotta get on foot
if you want me to get up on this thing.

01:47:51.230 --> 01:47:52.720
- Where were you?
- What happened?

01:47:52.899 --> 01:47:54.696
You're fucking late! Get in the van!

01:47:54.867 --> 01:47:56.232
What do you mean,
off the roof?

01:47:56.402 --> 01:47:58.063
What's going on? I came to meet you.

01:47:58.237 --> 01:47:59.761
- What the fuck...?
- Get in the van!

01:47:59.939 --> 01:48:02.874
I got four armed men right out front.
You want us to pursue?

01:48:03.042 --> 01:48:05.101
No, do not pursue. Stay in the car.

01:48:05.278 --> 01:48:07.405
- Fuck. No fucking pursuit.
- I need information.

01:48:07.580 --> 01:48:08.945
What came off the roof?

01:48:09.115 --> 01:48:10.605
- No pursuit.
- That's bullshit.

01:48:10.783 --> 01:48:12.546
Fuck this.

01:48:20.626 --> 01:48:22.253
Fitzy! Get in the van!

01:48:23.763 --> 01:48:26.698
Get in the fucking van! Let's go! Move!

01:48:26.866 --> 01:48:28.493
All right. I got him.

01:48:34.941 --> 01:48:37.136
32X to CP. We're being fired upon!

01:48:37.310 --> 01:48:40.711
<i>An officer is down. I repeat,</i>
<i>an officer is down. A trooper's been shot!</i>

01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:42.905
<i>Send some back...</i>

01:49:00.266 --> 01:49:03.429
So do you know
why Queenan went into that building?

01:49:03.603 --> 01:49:05.434
- No.
- Well, a better question...

01:49:05.605 --> 01:49:07.766
...is why the fuck
were your guys following him?

01:49:07.940 --> 01:49:10.670
I told Internal Investigations
to follow Captain Queenan.

01:49:10.843 --> 01:49:13.243
- Why?
- That's Internal Investigations' business.

01:49:14.146 --> 01:49:15.807
Fucking piece of shit!

01:49:15.982 --> 01:49:17.472
- All right.
- Hey, hey!

01:49:17.650 --> 01:49:19.015
- Fucking bitch!
- Let him go!

01:49:19.185 --> 01:49:22.348
Cocksucker! I don't have to fucking explain
anything to anybody!

01:49:22.521 --> 01:49:24.682
I can fucking investigate
anybody I want to!

01:49:24.857 --> 01:49:27.087
- Come on!
- I don't give a fuck what you think!

01:49:27.259 --> 01:49:30.660
I got reason to believe that Queenan
got killed by his fucking undercover.

01:49:30.830 --> 01:49:31.922
That's a fucking lie.

01:49:32.098 --> 01:49:35.659
He has fucking information
in a locked file, as did Captain Queenan.

01:49:35.835 --> 01:49:37.427
I need access to those files.

01:49:37.603 --> 01:49:40.629
I forgot the password but
if you come with me I'll give it to you.

01:49:40.806 --> 01:49:42.933
- That's a fucking lie.
- Nobody calls me a liar!

01:49:43.109 --> 01:49:45.907
Shut up! Work with the tech guys
to unlock those files.

01:49:46.078 --> 01:49:48.945
- Dignam, take a leave of absence.
- Take a leave of what?

01:49:49.115 --> 01:49:52.050
Queenan is dead. I'm your boss now.

01:49:52.218 --> 01:49:54.584
I don't care.
I'd rather hand in my papers first.

01:49:54.754 --> 01:49:58.155
World needs plenty of bartenders.
Two weeks with pay.

01:49:58.324 --> 01:49:59.791
Good.

01:50:01.627 --> 01:50:03.219
- Piece of shit.
- Fuck off.

01:50:05.164 --> 01:50:06.995
- I need those codes.
- No.

01:50:07.166 --> 01:50:09.293
You want those codes.

01:50:12.405 --> 01:50:14.134
So where the fuck were you?

01:50:15.808 --> 01:50:18.368
Well, boss told me to go home.

01:50:18.544 --> 01:50:22.742
Whatever. Maybe he did, maybe he didn't.
But you weren't at fucking home.

01:50:22.915 --> 01:50:24.382
So where the fuck were you?

01:50:24.984 --> 01:50:27.885
I was at the grocery store
with no signal, all right?

01:50:28.054 --> 01:50:30.045
When I got the signal, I got the call.

01:50:30.222 --> 01:50:33.248
What the fuck do you want from me?
Was I there or was I not there?

01:50:33.426 --> 01:50:35.485
Billy. Billy.

01:50:41.867 --> 01:50:43.391
Yeah?

01:50:45.604 --> 01:50:47.595
Yeah?

01:50:48.074 --> 01:50:50.235
You know what I thought today?

01:50:52.044 --> 01:50:53.739
What's that?

01:50:54.747 --> 01:50:58.205
Who didn't show up today is the rat.

01:51:01.687 --> 01:51:03.052
Yeah?

01:51:04.090 --> 01:51:07.890
- So?
- And you never been late in your life.

01:51:09.795 --> 01:51:12.025
When I called you...

01:51:12.198 --> 01:51:14.428
...I made a mistake.

01:51:14.600 --> 01:51:18.400
I gave you the wrong address...

01:51:18.571 --> 01:51:22.405
...but you showed up at the right one...

01:51:22.875 --> 01:51:24.775
...didn't you?

01:51:26.045 --> 01:51:28.605
Tell me why I didn't tell nobody, huh?

01:51:29.882 --> 01:51:31.213
Tell me why.

01:51:54.106 --> 01:51:57.507
That cop was tough.
We were excessive with the cop.

01:51:57.676 --> 01:51:59.473
He's dead.

01:51:59.645 --> 01:52:01.272
I'm going home.

01:52:01.447 --> 01:52:04.245
- Your guys should not have done that.
<i>- One of us had to die.</i>

01:52:04.416 --> 01:52:06.441
With me it tends to be the other guy.

01:52:06.619 --> 01:52:08.086
But Queenan.
Now I got no access.

01:52:08.254 --> 01:52:11.451
You killed the guy who had the info.
Dignam's gone. Forget about him.

01:52:11.624 --> 01:52:14.286
<i>- He resigned.</i>
- I don't give a fuck about Dignam.

01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:15.927
<i>He put in his papers, Frank.</i>

01:52:16.095 --> 01:52:20.156
- He left. I don't know where he is.
- Don't get your balls in an uproar, Collie.

01:52:20.332 --> 01:52:21.765
<i>That Irish pissant...</i>

01:52:21.934 --> 01:52:25.597
...he's so hot for me, we give him
a whiff of my ass, he'll crawl right in it.

01:52:25.771 --> 01:52:27.830
<i>Let's give him a whiff.</i>

01:52:28.007 --> 01:52:31.670
- I will.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

01:52:33.345 --> 01:52:35.006
Sweetheart.

01:52:35.181 --> 01:52:37.376
You're giving me a hard-on.

01:52:37.983 --> 01:52:39.382
Are you sure it's me?

01:52:39.885 --> 01:52:43.150
Not all that talk
about whiffing and crawling up asses?

01:52:43.622 --> 01:52:45.613
Watch your fucking mouth.

01:52:45.791 --> 01:52:48.225
No. You watch it.

01:52:48.928 --> 01:52:51.226
Let me straighten you out.

01:52:59.138 --> 01:53:02.005
I tried to call you a few times.

01:53:05.211 --> 01:53:06.974
I know.

01:53:33.372 --> 01:53:37.274
Listen, I can't be a friend to you.

01:53:42.414 --> 01:53:44.314
I'm sorry.

01:53:50.789 --> 01:53:52.518
Yeah...

01:53:57.096 --> 01:53:58.723
...I know.

01:56:07.359 --> 01:56:08.849
Yeah.

01:56:09.661 --> 01:56:12.892
You called this number
on a dead guy's phone.

01:56:13.332 --> 01:56:14.890
Who are you?

01:56:15.134 --> 01:56:17.398
So it is you.

01:56:18.604 --> 01:56:21.596
Well, thank God you're all right.
We were very worried.

01:56:23.008 --> 01:56:24.635
Who are you?

01:56:25.544 --> 01:56:27.569
This is Sergeant Sullivan.

01:56:27.746 --> 01:56:29.509
I'm taking over Queenan's unit.

01:56:30.215 --> 01:56:32.240
Let me talk to Dignam
to confirm it.

01:56:32.418 --> 01:56:33.749
<i>Staff Sergeant Dignam...</i>

01:56:33.919 --> 01:56:37.116
...is on a leave of absence.
He's very upset.

01:56:37.289 --> 01:56:39.484
We're all very upset.

01:56:40.125 --> 01:56:42.889
<i>I think the best thing would be</i>
<i>for you to come in.</i>

01:56:43.862 --> 01:56:46.763
We need you to come in.
Can you come in?

01:56:48.233 --> 01:56:49.222
<i>We'll meet...</i>

01:57:28.407 --> 01:57:30.705
<i>Police confirm</i>
<i>the body of the man found dead...</i>

01:57:30.876 --> 01:57:32.844
<i>...in the Fenway marshes</i>
<i>yesterday...</i>

01:57:33.011 --> 01:57:36.003
<i>...is that of Timothy Delahunt,</i>
<i>an undercover policeman for...</i>

01:57:36.181 --> 01:57:38.672
<i>...the city of Boston.</i>
<i>This was the scene yesterday...</i>

01:57:38.851 --> 01:57:41.820
<i>...when Delahunt's body was found</i>
<i>in the marshes near the Fenway.</i>

01:57:41.987 --> 01:57:43.545
<i>As for who did this or why...</i>

01:57:43.722 --> 01:57:46.122
<i>...that's something police</i>
<i>are working on right now.</i>

01:57:46.291 --> 01:57:49.749
- I don't believe it.
- What can't you believe?

01:57:49.995 --> 01:57:53.453
I spent all fucking night dragging
the poor bastard in there.

01:57:53.632 --> 01:57:55.566
Tell me how they found him so fast.

01:57:55.734 --> 01:57:58.362
Somebody walking
a fucking dog in three feet of mud?

01:57:58.537 --> 01:58:00.698
What kind of fucking
size of dog is that?

01:58:00.873 --> 01:58:03.000
Must have been a big fucking dog, man.

01:58:03.175 --> 01:58:05.405
I spent all fucking night doing it, man.

01:58:05.777 --> 01:58:07.074
I'm embarrassed.

01:58:07.746 --> 01:58:10.408
I still don't believe he was a cop.
I don't believe it.

01:58:10.582 --> 01:58:15.110
The cops are saying he's a cop...

01:58:15.487 --> 01:58:17.682
...so I won't look for the cop.

01:58:18.957 --> 01:58:20.584
Are you soft, Fitz?

01:58:20.759 --> 01:58:25.719
When I tell you to dump
a body in the marsh...

01:58:25.898 --> 01:58:28.833
...you dump him in the marsh.

01:58:29.868 --> 01:58:33.167
Not where some guy from
John Hancock goes every Thursday...

01:58:33.338 --> 01:58:35.431
...to get a fucking blowjob!

01:58:36.208 --> 01:58:38.369
Don't laugh!

01:58:39.211 --> 01:58:42.112
This ain't reality TV!

01:58:46.051 --> 01:58:47.814
Proceed.

01:59:10.275 --> 01:59:11.742
- What?
- Yeah.

01:59:11.910 --> 01:59:14.674
You got a tail. Two cars.
Not very subtle.

01:59:14.846 --> 01:59:18.407
They're not gonna be subtle from now on.
That's what I've been trying to say.

01:59:18.584 --> 01:59:19.710
So get rid of them.

01:59:19.885 --> 01:59:22.979
There's no need for you
to go yourself, Frank.

01:59:23.155 --> 01:59:25.385
Get rid of the fucking tail!

01:59:30.329 --> 01:59:31.887
All right.

01:59:38.203 --> 01:59:41.400
Fucking rats.
It's wearing me thin.

01:59:41.573 --> 01:59:44.371
Francis, it's a nation of fucking rats.

02:00:00.692 --> 02:00:04.025
Stop, stop. Pull them off Costello.
There's no need to surveil him.

02:00:04.196 --> 02:00:06.562
- What are you saying?
- I got it from an undercover.

02:00:06.732 --> 02:00:09.394
He knows he's being followed.
So let the UC take him in.

02:00:09.601 --> 02:00:10.966
- Undercover?
- Queenan's guy.

02:00:11.136 --> 02:00:13.798
He called when he found out
Queenan died. I'm running him.

02:00:13.972 --> 02:00:16.907
- You give him to me.
- No, I can give you Costello's destination.

02:00:17.109 --> 02:00:19.577
- You know where he's going?
- Yes. And what he's doing.

02:00:19.745 --> 02:00:21.906
Get rid of the tail,
get Special Ops on standby.

02:00:22.080 --> 02:00:24.514
- We'll take this prick tonight.
- Let's go. Now.

02:00:24.683 --> 02:00:27.675
All units fall back.
All units fall back.

02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:50.099
It's the warehouse he owns
over on Sheffield.

02:00:50.275 --> 02:00:52.869
He's gotta have a container or a truck
or something there. Go.

02:01:17.169 --> 02:01:18.693
Load it.

02:01:26.712 --> 02:01:29.010
Frank, how do you know
you don't have a tail, huh?

02:01:30.282 --> 02:01:32.250
Were you not in the fucking car?

02:01:32.417 --> 02:01:35.477
Yeah, what if they took one off
and they put another one on?

02:01:38.690 --> 02:01:40.487
Load.

02:01:48.066 --> 02:01:49.897
Go, go!

02:01:52.337 --> 02:01:53.895
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

02:01:55.974 --> 02:01:58.101
Frank wants me to check
the back. You go ahead.

02:01:58.276 --> 02:02:01.734
- Watch your fucking back.
- Move out! Go on!

02:02:10.756 --> 02:02:13.190
Cocksuckers.

02:02:19.197 --> 02:02:21.757
Motherfucking shit!

02:02:25.203 --> 02:02:26.864
Motherfucking!

02:02:30.275 --> 02:02:32.539
Back the fuck up!

02:02:32.711 --> 02:02:34.804
They fucking shot me.

02:02:38.517 --> 02:02:39.643
Get down!

02:02:42.654 --> 02:02:44.212
Come on, fucking bastards!

02:03:02.941 --> 02:03:04.408
Fuck it.

02:03:43.849 --> 02:03:47.615
How the fuck did this happen?

02:03:49.020 --> 02:03:51.614
You're an FBI informant?

02:03:51.790 --> 02:03:53.985
Are you fucking kidding me?

02:03:55.460 --> 02:03:57.155
Grow up.

02:03:57.863 --> 02:04:00.798
Of course I talk to the FBI.

02:04:00.966 --> 02:04:02.456
Do they know who I am?

02:04:04.402 --> 02:04:08.771
I never gave up anybody
who wasn't going down anyway.

02:04:09.808 --> 02:04:12.242
Nobody knows nothing.

02:04:13.845 --> 02:04:15.335
Frank.

02:04:15.647 --> 02:04:18.548
Frank. Frank.

02:04:18.717 --> 02:04:20.708
Do they know about me?

02:04:22.420 --> 02:04:24.945
I know about you, Collie.

02:04:25.123 --> 02:04:27.956
You know I'd never give you up.

02:04:28.693 --> 02:04:31.457
- You're like a...
- What? Like a son?

02:04:32.364 --> 02:04:35.731
To you? Is that what this is about?

02:04:36.701 --> 02:04:41.035
All that murdering and fucking,
and no sons.

02:05:03.061 --> 02:05:05.495
Fucking rat prick!

02:05:27.085 --> 02:05:28.677
<i>Frank?</i>

02:05:28.853 --> 02:05:30.343
Yeah?

02:05:32.090 --> 02:05:33.318
Who's this?

02:05:35.226 --> 02:05:36.853
Gwen?

02:05:37.996 --> 02:05:40.089
Where the hell's Frank?

02:05:41.166 --> 02:05:42.963
Frank got shot.

02:05:45.804 --> 02:05:48.204
Gwen, we lost Frank.

02:05:56.581 --> 02:05:58.208
I got him!

02:05:58.383 --> 02:06:00.817
I got Costello here!

02:06:04.956 --> 02:06:07.447
Hey, good job, sarge.

02:06:08.226 --> 02:06:09.784
No, it's...

02:06:11.196 --> 02:06:12.788
For you.

02:06:13.865 --> 02:06:16.925
- Thank you.
- No. Thank you.

02:06:20.438 --> 02:06:23.669
He's been waiting here
a long time for you.

02:06:23.875 --> 02:06:26.309
How'd you get him without the files?

02:06:26.478 --> 02:06:29.276
Caller ID on Queenan's phone.

02:06:30.248 --> 02:06:31.613
You know that guy?

02:06:31.783 --> 02:06:34.650
Yeah. We were classmates
in the academy together.

02:06:42.093 --> 02:06:43.754
Good to see you, trooper.

02:06:43.928 --> 02:06:46.590
- Yeah.
- Colin Sullivan. We spoke on the phone.

02:06:46.765 --> 02:06:48.323
- Yeah.
- So.

02:06:49.868 --> 02:06:51.631
Now, how long were you undercover?

02:06:51.803 --> 02:06:53.703
Long time.

02:06:53.872 --> 02:06:55.703
- Long fucking time.
- Yeah. Yeah.

02:06:56.107 --> 02:07:01.044
Well, I can't even tell you the debt...

02:07:03.882 --> 02:07:07.215
I just want you to know I'll be
recommending you for the Medal of Merit.

02:07:07.385 --> 02:07:09.080
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

02:07:10.021 --> 02:07:12.387
That's kind of like a gold star
around here, huh?

02:07:14.426 --> 02:07:16.223
It's the highest honor we got.

02:07:16.394 --> 02:07:19.192
Look, I just want
my identity back, all right?

02:07:19.364 --> 02:07:21.355
- That's all.
- All right.

02:07:21.533 --> 02:07:24.434
- I understand. You wanna be a cop again.
- No, no.

02:07:24.602 --> 02:07:28.197
Being a cop's not an identity.
I want my identity back.

02:07:28.473 --> 02:07:31.442
Check your computer. Go on.
You'll have to excuse my behavior.

02:07:31.609 --> 02:07:35.568
My only contact in the last six months
has been a police shrink.

02:07:38.216 --> 02:07:40.514
How's that working for you?

02:07:40.685 --> 02:07:42.414
Is it helpful?

02:07:43.154 --> 02:07:45.918
What are you gonna do
about Costello's rat in this building?

02:07:48.526 --> 02:07:51.757
- I'm gonna find the prick.
- Yeah.

02:07:52.197 --> 02:07:54.893
I'm gonna find him, I'm gonna arrest him.

02:07:55.066 --> 02:07:58.229
- Good.
- Anything you can do to help me...

02:07:58.403 --> 02:08:02.237
You know, I mean, did Frank ever
mention a name...? You know, anything.

02:08:02.407 --> 02:08:05.001
Someone he was in contact with.
Anything you can give me.

02:08:05.176 --> 02:08:07.736
I'm all done being a cop, all right?

02:08:07.912 --> 02:08:10.073
I just want my money
and I wanna go home.

02:08:10.248 --> 02:08:12.648
All right. That'll be
the best thing for everybody.

02:08:12.817 --> 02:08:14.216
Fair enough.

02:08:14.819 --> 02:08:19.279
I just, I can't get into your file
unless I have your password.

02:08:21.459 --> 02:08:22.483
It's my name.

02:08:23.294 --> 02:08:25.660
William Costigan Jr.

02:08:25.830 --> 02:08:29.095
They gave it to me in case I had to
explain myself to someone like you.

02:08:29.667 --> 02:08:31.601
It's your name.

02:08:33.705 --> 02:08:35.104
All right.

02:08:35.273 --> 02:08:37.969
Fucking unreal, that...
Well, makes a lot of sense.

02:08:38.143 --> 02:08:40.373
Listen, Bill, I gotta run this
in the other room.

02:08:40.545 --> 02:08:42.809
This computer's getting
all frigging blooey on me.

02:08:42.981 --> 02:08:46.747
Give me two minutes. I'll have
you out of here in no time.

02:10:20.078 --> 02:10:23.912
All right, everything checks out,
so let's get you paid.

02:10:54.879 --> 02:10:56.642
I know.

02:10:58.182 --> 02:11:00.673
I know. I'm not...
I'm not here for that, okay?

02:11:00.952 --> 02:11:02.544
I'm not.

02:11:04.756 --> 02:11:08.021
Listen. I've gotta give you something.

02:11:08.192 --> 02:11:10.626
Something I need you to keep.

02:11:10.795 --> 02:11:12.387
For me.

02:11:14.666 --> 02:11:16.258
Okay?

02:11:19.871 --> 02:11:24.171
- What is it?
- This is for you to hold. Only you.

02:11:24.342 --> 02:11:28.301
You open this if something happens to me
or if I call you and I tell you to open it.

02:11:28.479 --> 02:11:31.039
You're the only person
I can trust, all right?

02:11:32.650 --> 02:11:34.242
Please.

02:11:37.789 --> 02:11:40.189
- All right.
- Look, I'm sorry to even...

02:11:40.358 --> 02:11:43.054
I'm sorry to even show up here
like this, you know?

02:11:43.227 --> 02:11:46.492
I... There's just no one else
I could give it to.

02:11:47.932 --> 02:11:50.093
There's no one else.

02:11:50.868 --> 02:11:53.598
- I'm really sorry.
- I...

02:11:54.205 --> 02:11:56.173
You know, I have...

02:11:56.341 --> 02:11:58.775
- I...
- Whatever you have to say...

02:11:58.943 --> 02:12:01.138
...think about it real hard, all right?

02:12:01.312 --> 02:12:04.839
If you still wanna tell me,
you tell me in two weeks, okay?

02:12:34.612 --> 02:12:36.546
I was dreaming I was dead.

02:12:37.915 --> 02:12:42.113
Death is hard. Life is much easier.

02:12:43.054 --> 02:12:46.285
- What's this?
- Open it.

02:12:55.133 --> 02:12:57.795
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:12:58.836 --> 02:13:00.303
Really?

02:13:00.972 --> 02:13:02.496
Yeah.

02:13:02.673 --> 02:13:06.234
And they say
that this little speck...

02:13:06.411 --> 02:13:08.606
...is a penis.

02:13:11.883 --> 02:13:13.748
It's a boy.

02:13:13.918 --> 02:13:16.716
Yeah, well,
one usually follows the other.

02:13:18.222 --> 02:13:20.213
Can you still?

02:14:10.775 --> 02:14:12.766
<i>I hope I won't have to remind you...</i>

02:14:12.944 --> 02:14:17.142
<i>...that if you don't find this cheese-eating</i>
<i>rat bastard in your department...</i>

02:14:17.315 --> 02:14:20.978
<i>...you can assume it won't be me</i>
<i>who pays for it.</i>

02:14:21.152 --> 02:14:23.985
<i>Now, why would you</i>
<i>have to remind me of that?</i>

02:14:24.155 --> 02:14:29.457
<i>Would I...? Would I be any good at what</i>
<i>I do if I didn't fucking already know that?</i>

02:14:29.627 --> 02:14:32.824
<i>Frank, you gotta trust me.</i>
<i>I can get the rat.</i>

02:14:32.997 --> 02:14:35.363
<i>You just gotta let me do it</i>
<i>my way, Frank.</i>

02:14:35.533 --> 02:14:38.934
<i>Just let me do it.</i>
<i>Let me do what I do.</i>

02:14:39.103 --> 02:14:42.971
<i>Hey, it fucking involves lying and</i>
<i>I'm pretty fucking good at that. Right?</i>

02:14:46.644 --> 02:14:48.202
What?

02:14:51.816 --> 02:14:53.306
What?

02:14:55.620 --> 02:14:57.918
<i>- We got a cop in my crew.</i>
<i>- Yeah, I know.</i>

02:14:58.089 --> 02:15:02.048
<i>- I'm kind of getting that feeling too.</i>
<i>- He's one of yours. Inside.</i>

02:15:02.226 --> 02:15:03.557
<i>- You seen anything?</i>
<i>- Frank.</i>

02:15:03.728 --> 02:15:07.323
<i>I got no access to Queenan's undercover</i>
<i>files. He and Dignam run the snitches.</i>

02:15:07.498 --> 02:15:12.060
<i>- I'm doing my...</i>
- You know what, I thought I was the liar.

02:15:12.236 --> 02:15:15.171
Hey, I can explain that!

02:15:20.344 --> 02:15:22.369
Costello recorded everything.

02:15:22.547 --> 02:15:27.109
He put all the tapes in a box and kept them
with his lawyer. That was his insurance.

02:15:27.285 --> 02:15:28.775
His lawyer came to me.

02:15:28.953 --> 02:15:30.716
Imagine that, you rat fuck.

02:15:30.888 --> 02:15:32.879
<i>Costello trusted me more than anyone.</i>

02:15:33.558 --> 02:15:36.755
Sound quality good enough?
Because I was a little worried.

02:15:37.261 --> 02:15:39.855
- What do you want?
- I told you I want my identity back...

02:15:40.031 --> 02:15:42.056
...you two-faced faggot.

02:15:42.366 --> 02:15:46.200
- All right, where are you?
- Three o'clock. Where Queenan died.

02:15:46.370 --> 02:15:48.304
You keep your cell on.

02:16:00.418 --> 02:16:02.181
Open the door.

02:16:06.190 --> 02:16:10.183
Open... Didn't we already talk about this?

02:16:11.362 --> 02:16:13.523
This is my job.

02:16:38.789 --> 02:16:40.780
- Freeze! Get your fucking hands up!
- Hey!

02:16:40.958 --> 02:16:42.482
Put the fucking gun down!

02:16:42.660 --> 02:16:45.891
Put the gun down, all right?
I came here to talk some sense into you.

02:16:46.063 --> 02:16:47.620
- Hands!
- Just act professional.

02:16:47.798 --> 02:16:49.823
- I can get you your money.
- What did you say?

02:16:50.001 --> 02:16:53.596
- I can get you your money.
- You didn't come here to talk, all right?

02:16:53.771 --> 02:16:56.740
- You came here to get arrested.
- You got fucking tapes? Of what?

02:16:56.906 --> 02:17:00.398
Costello was my informant.
I was a rat? Fuck you! Prove it.

02:17:00.577 --> 02:17:02.568
He was working for me.
He was my informant.

02:17:02.746 --> 02:17:04.611
Shut your fucking mouth.
Come on, get up!

02:17:04.781 --> 02:17:07.182
What is this, a citizen's arrest?
Blow me, all right?

02:17:07.351 --> 02:17:10.183
Only one of us is a cop here, Bill.
You understand that, Bill?

02:17:10.353 --> 02:17:12.254
- No one knows you.
- Shut the fuck up!

02:17:12.423 --> 02:17:15.688
I'm a sergeant in the Massachusetts
State Police. Who the fuck are you?

02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:18.987
- I erased you!
- You erased me, huh?

02:17:19.163 --> 02:17:21.825
Yeah, go ahead, shoot a cop, Einstein.
Watch what happens.

02:17:21.999 --> 02:17:24.467
This bullet would
go right through your fucking head!

02:17:24.635 --> 02:17:27.331
- Watch what happens!
- What, so you can get the parade, huh?

02:17:27.504 --> 02:17:31.965
The bagpipes and bullshit? Fuck you!
Fuck you, I'm fucking arresting you!

02:17:32.143 --> 02:17:34.906
- That's the stupidest thing you could do.
- Shut the fuck up!

02:17:37.647 --> 02:17:39.878
I could give a fuck
if the charges don't stick.

02:17:40.050 --> 02:17:41.745
I'm still fucking arresting you.

02:17:42.186 --> 02:17:44.085
Get up.

02:17:45.255 --> 02:17:48.281
Drop your weapon and step away
from Sergeant Sullivan.

02:17:48.459 --> 02:17:50.984
I called you. You specifically. Look:

02:17:51.162 --> 02:17:54.529
You know who I am. I'm not gonna shoot.
I told you to meet me downstairs.

02:17:54.699 --> 02:17:57.668
Put your weapon on the deck
and step away from Sergeant Sullivan!

02:17:57.834 --> 02:17:59.962
Where's Dignam?
I told you to bring Dignam!

02:18:00.137 --> 02:18:02.367
Shoot this motherfucker!
Would you fucking shoot!

02:18:02.540 --> 02:18:06.236
- Drop your weapon. We'll discuss it.
- Look, he's Costello's rat, all right?

02:18:06.410 --> 02:18:11.074
I got boxes of tapes! Evidence!
Other documents proving it!

02:18:13.484 --> 02:18:15.418
Maybe you do.

02:18:15.585 --> 02:18:17.713
But right now I need you
to drop the weapon!

02:18:17.888 --> 02:18:20.857
I have evidence cold-linking
this prick to Costello, all right?

02:18:21.025 --> 02:18:23.994
- Would you shoot this fucking prick!
- You know who I am.

02:18:24.161 --> 02:18:26.254
- You know who I am.
- Shoot this fucking prick.

02:18:26.430 --> 02:18:28.625
I'm taking him downstairs now.

02:18:31.936 --> 02:18:33.767
You know who I am.

02:18:58.896 --> 02:19:00.761
Shut up.

02:19:01.799 --> 02:19:04.825
I can't wait to see you explain this
to a Suffolk County jury...

02:19:05.002 --> 02:19:06.196
...you fucking cocksucker.

02:19:06.370 --> 02:19:08.895
This is gonna be fucking fun.

02:19:20.049 --> 02:19:22.348
Just fucking kill me.

02:19:23.954 --> 02:19:26.115
Just fucking kill me.

02:19:28.392 --> 02:19:30.450
I am killing you.

02:20:06.664 --> 02:20:09.394
Did you think you were the only one
he had on the inside?

02:20:09.633 --> 02:20:11.931
Costello was gonna sell us to the FBI.

02:20:12.102 --> 02:20:13.797
It's you and me now, you understand?

02:20:13.971 --> 02:20:16.838
We gotta take care of each other,
you understand?

02:20:30.454 --> 02:20:32.046
Give me that.

02:20:47.471 --> 02:20:50.838
<i>Right. Slow. March.</i>

02:20:59.049 --> 02:21:01.244
<i>I attempted to subdue Trooper Barrigan...</i>

02:21:01.418 --> 02:21:05.946
<i>...at which time he drew down on me,</i>
<i>and I was able to squeeze off one shot...</i>

02:21:06.123 --> 02:21:08.284
<i>...and strike him in the head.</i>

02:21:08.459 --> 02:21:10.893
<i>At that time I immediately</i>
<i>checked the vitals...</i>

02:21:11.061 --> 02:21:13.256
<i>...on both</i>
<i>Troopers Brown and Costigan...</i>

02:21:13.430 --> 02:21:16.593
...and discovered that they had expired.

02:21:19.770 --> 02:21:22.034
I just wanna go on record.

02:21:22.773 --> 02:21:26.732
I'm recommending William Costigan
for the Medal of Merit.

02:21:37.721 --> 02:21:40.053
- Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord.
- Ready?

02:21:40.224 --> 02:21:43.125
- And let perpetual light shine upon him.
- Fold.

02:21:43.294 --> 02:21:46.092
May he rest in peace. Amen.

02:21:46.263 --> 02:21:48.595
May his soul and the souls...

02:21:48.766 --> 02:21:53.601
...of all the faithful departed,
through the mercy of God, rest in peace.

02:21:53.771 --> 02:21:55.363
Amen.

02:22:24.802 --> 02:22:27.032
Detail. Half left. Face.

02:22:28.405 --> 02:22:30.396
Prepare to fire.

02:22:30.641 --> 02:22:32.268
Fire.

02:22:32.443 --> 02:22:34.934
Prepare to fire. Fire.

02:22:35.846 --> 02:22:38.872
Prepare to fire. Fire.

02:22:39.316 --> 02:22:42.615
Detail. Half right. Face.

02:22:56.033 --> 02:22:58.399
I'll catch up with you guys.

02:23:05.676 --> 02:23:07.507
What about the baby?

02:23:25.229 --> 02:23:26.856
Hi, pup.

02:23:58.395 --> 02:24:00.022
Okay.
