WEBVTT

00:42.709 --> 00:43.950
Not tomorrow,
the day after, right.

00:45.420 --> 00:47.662
You, me, Gary, Brad.
We'll be teeing off at...

00:48.382 --> 00:50.920
- Well, I like Gary.
- Dr. Dandewarr, I'm in a hurry...

00:51.134 --> 00:52.466
We'll be teeing off at 7:30.

00:52.678 --> 00:54.089
If you're not there
because of Gary, come on.

00:54.513 --> 00:55.469
I gotta go.

00:58.141 --> 00:59.257
Am I missing something?

00:59.518 --> 01:01.009
Why did Dr. Cho order
a head X-ray

01:01.228 --> 01:02.719
when the man
was bitten on the hand?

01:02.938 --> 01:04.269
Uh, the patient was
in a bar fight.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.940
He was communicative when he was
admitted at 6:00. That's 6:00am.

01:08.652 --> 01:10.439
This morning,
that's when I started my shift.

01:10.654 --> 01:12.190
Where is the patient now?
I'd like to see him.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.481
They moved him. One of
the night nurses can...

01:14.741 --> 01:16.778
- Page me when you find him.
- Sure.

01:19.288 --> 01:20.278
I'll do that.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.656
Cora, can you do me a favor

01:23.875 --> 01:25.332
- and locate a patient for me?
- Hey, Ana. Sure.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.620
- Edward Solomon?
- Yep.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.463
- Aren't you off?
- An hour ago.

01:32.259 --> 01:34.546
An hour ago.

01:35.887 --> 01:37.344
Here he is.
They had him backwards.

01:37.556 --> 01:39.297
Solomon Edward.
He's upstairs in ICU.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.058
- From a bite?
- I don't know what from.

01:42.769 --> 01:44.635
Toxicology's gonna
work him up in the morning.

01:45.022 --> 01:46.183
I'm gonna get out of here.

01:46.398 --> 01:48.230
Can you page Dr. Dandewarr
and let him know?

01:48.442 --> 01:49.478
- Sure.
- Thanks.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.730
Did you talk to
Luis about Sunday?

01:52.154 --> 01:53.986
- I will. Night, Cora.
- Night.

02:12.299 --> 02:14.040
- Hey.
- Hey, Ana.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.176
Let's go.
It's starting early.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.045
Great. Later.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.505
Let's go, let's go!

02:28.190 --> 02:29.351
<i>...an unconfirmed...</i>

02:29.566 --> 02:31.057
<i>...confirm
it is not an isolated...</i>

02:49.211 --> 02:50.201
Hey, Vivian.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.831
Ana, look,
I can go backwards.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.003
Let me see.

02:54.633 --> 02:56.295
Hey, that's amazing.

02:56.593 --> 02:57.709
Maybe tomorrow after work,

02:57.928 --> 02:59.794
I'll do a few backward laps
around the block with you, okay?

03:00.013 --> 03:01.299
- Okay.
- All right.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.051
Careful, now,
I gotta pull in.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.882
Say hey to your mom for me,
okay?

03:05.102 --> 03:06.092
Okay.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.111
- Hey.
- Hey, you.

03:17.572 --> 03:20.064
You're late, you missed it.
They just cut the mailman loose.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.775
- No, Richie? The chubby one?
- Mm.

03:22.994 --> 03:24.485
Oh my God,
he had such a sweet voice.

03:24.705 --> 03:25.991
I can't believe that.

03:29.126 --> 03:30.207
There you go.

03:31.586 --> 03:32.667
Hey, you.

03:38.844 --> 03:40.005
How'd it go today?

03:40.220 --> 03:41.381
Not bad. You?

03:41.847 --> 03:43.133
Good. I'm trading shifts
with Cora

03:43.348 --> 03:44.839
so if I take Sunday,

03:45.058 --> 03:47.220
I can have a three-day weekend
at the end of the month.

03:48.270 --> 03:50.432
- Sunday? Yeah.
- Is that okay? Yeah.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.441
I think Cora's got this new guy

03:55.652 --> 03:57.018
she doesn't want me
to know about.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.978
Really? Wow. Lucky her.

04:00.449 --> 04:03.032
I thought maybe you'd gone out
with the girls or something.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.985

Officer, sir?
You do not want to go that way.

over this way are locked.

19:19.575 --> 19:20.861

go down that direction,

19:23.746 --> 19:24.736
check for...

19:28.584 --> 19:29.700
All right. Okay.

Maybe it's better
you stay here with the gun.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.713
Andre and I will check around.

19:38.135 --> 19:39.421

No, just stay right here.
Stay right here.

- Come on, move.

23:32.494 --> 23:33.450
Move!

23:34.705 --> 23:35.786
Which way?

23:35.998 --> 23:38.206
Here. Elevators.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.246
Let's go! Let's go!

23:58.896 --> 24:00.103
Can I see that arm?

24:01.482 --> 24:03.064
- I need to suture that.
- Yeah.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.150
Are you okay?

24:06.362 --> 24:07.352
Yeah.

24:14.244 --> 24:15.405
Find someplace else.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.578
Look, we just need a place...

24:17.790 --> 24:19.031
Maybe you didn't hear me.

24:19.667 --> 24:21.374
There is no place else.

24:22.294 --> 24:23.284
Well, it's tough shit,

24:23.504 --> 24:25.496
'cause this is our place
and you can't stay here.

24:25.714 --> 24:28.457
Yeah. And you
already trashed Metropolis.

24:28.676 --> 24:30.167
Look, dumbass,
my wife is pregnant.

24:30.386 --> 24:31.968
We can't run anymore.

24:32.179 --> 24:35.013
- His arm...
- Those things are down there.

24:35.724 --> 24:38.057
Well, these are
all your problems, not mine.

24:38.352 --> 24:41.186
If I put my foot up your ass,
would that be your problem?

24:41.397 --> 24:43.935
Hey, asshole, I'm the one
pointing the gun at you.

24:45.567 --> 24:46.899
He is a cop, CJ.

24:48.070 --> 24:49.561
So what?

24:51.240 --> 24:52.856
We're not gonna cause
any trouble.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.986
Just let us stay here
for a little while. Please.

25:03.460 --> 25:04.416
Okay.

25:05.170 --> 25:07.162
Come out of there slowly
and give your weapons

25:07.381 --> 25:08.371
- to Bart and Terry.
- Don't do it.

25:08.590 --> 25:09.751
You must be
out of your fucking mind.

25:09.967 --> 25:11.378
You can take your ass on
over to Quality Inn,

25:11.593 --> 25:12.504
if it's still there, Shaq.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.553
Huh? You want to do that?

25:17.433 --> 25:18.469
Let's go.

25:20.310 --> 25:22.302
Hey, don't give him that gun.

25:23.188 --> 25:24.554
Fuck.

25:28.569 --> 25:29.525
Fuck.

26:00.684 --> 26:02.471
All right. Let's go, guys.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.929
Come on. Get your own little TV.

26:06.148 --> 26:07.514
Come on. Let's go.

26:10.027 --> 26:10.983
Excuse me.

26:11.862 --> 26:13.819
Please. Is there a restroom?

26:14.031 --> 26:16.023
No. You're staying here.

26:16.366 --> 26:17.732
Then why don't you tell us

26:17.951 --> 26:19.943
which spot in here
you'd like us to take a piss.

26:23.373 --> 26:25.831
All right. It's around
the corner, that way.

26:26.043 --> 26:28.205
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
where do you think you're going?

26:28.462 --> 26:30.124
She's not going anywhere alone.

26:30.881 --> 26:32.042
"She's not going anywhere..."

26:32.257 --> 26:33.418
This is a fucking
nursery school!

26:33.634 --> 26:34.920
Terry, go with them.

26:35.594 --> 26:38.758
<i>Hi, I'm Bill Vibert
with 23V Cable News.</i>

26:38.972 --> 26:40.383
<i>I'm at one
of the collection depots</i>

26:40.599 --> 26:42.556
<i>waiting to interview
Sheriff Cahill.</i>

26:43.644 --> 26:44.976
<i>I understand you're having
a difficult time</i>

26:45.187 --> 26:46.052
<i>killing these things...</i>

26:46.271 --> 26:47.352
<i>Just shoot 'em in the head.</i>

26:47.564 --> 26:50.352
<i>They seem to go down permanently
when you shoot 'em in the head.</i>

26:50.567 --> 26:52.433
<i>Then you gotta burn them.
You gotta burn...</i>

26:52.653 --> 26:55.942
<i>Danny! Danny! Put another round
in that woman over there!</i>

26:56.156 --> 26:57.442
<i>Look! She's a twitcher!</i>

26:57.699 --> 26:59.190
Twitcher.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.360
Now, that is one cool
motherfucker.

27:03.956 --> 27:05.117
Bleeding's not gonna stop
on its own.

27:05.332 --> 27:06.197
I need to stitch his arm.

27:06.917 --> 27:08.328
You a fucking doctor?

27:08.794 --> 27:10.456
No, I'm a fucking nurse.

27:14.424 --> 27:16.336
<i>I know some of these people
that we're putting down.</i>

27:16.552 --> 27:18.134
First aid kit's
in the security office.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.420
<i>What are you gonna do?
It's gotta be done.</i>

27:21.140 --> 27:22.676
Huh? What did I tell you boys?

27:22.891 --> 27:24.473
<i>Get those bodies
off the truck!</i>

27:24.685 --> 27:26.017
<i>We haven't got all day here.</i>

27:26.228 --> 27:27.935
America always
sorts its shit out.

27:38.699 --> 27:39.906
You know, you're lucky.

27:40.159 --> 27:41.650
He could have bitten it off.

28:00.387 --> 28:01.923
<i>Yes, I believe you're referring</i>

28:02.139 --> 28:03.721
<i>to a report
that came in this morning.</i>

28:03.932 --> 28:05.514
<i>That report was completely...</i>

28:05.726 --> 28:07.513
<i>What can we tell
the people out there</i>

28:07.728 --> 28:09.060
<i>that don't know what to do?</i>

28:10.063 --> 28:12.976
<i>What I would suggest
is that you come to Fort Pastor.</i>

28:13.192 --> 28:14.273
<i>If you can't make it here,
we have</i>

28:14.484 --> 28:15.725
<i>multiple search-and-rescue teams
out there</i>

28:15.944 --> 28:17.151
<i>and they will find you.</i>

28:17.779 --> 28:18.895
My brother's there.

28:19.531 --> 28:20.897
He's waiting for me.

28:41.887 --> 28:44.345
What's the holdup, darling?

28:46.725 --> 28:47.806
Hm?

28:53.565 --> 28:54.806
So what's the plan?

28:55.651 --> 28:56.858
The plan is you drink

28:57.069 --> 28:58.480
a tall glass
of shut-the-fuck-up.

28:58.946 --> 29:02.030
OK. That's one idea.

29:03.283 --> 29:04.819
What about
locking this place down?

29:05.744 --> 29:07.360
Sooner or later,
they're gonna get in here.

29:07.579 --> 29:08.569
Mm.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.990
That's good.
Like I hadn't thought of that.

29:12.209 --> 29:13.950
Okay, no doubt. You probably
already thought about

29:14.169 --> 29:15.956
putting a sign up on the roof.

29:17.381 --> 29:20.044
'Cause, you know,
there's still planes in the air.

29:20.884 --> 29:22.000
Might be good

29:22.511 --> 29:24.002
to let them know we're alive.

29:35.565 --> 29:37.352
We can get some paint
from Case Hardware.

29:38.110 --> 29:40.147
Use some office doors
to board up the weak spots.

29:40.362 --> 29:41.978
That's a solid plan.

29:42.906 --> 29:44.067
CJ, is it?

29:46.618 --> 29:48.610
- Yeah.
- All right, CJ.

29:56.044 --> 29:57.831
All right, everybody listen up.

29:58.046 --> 29:59.162
I'm gonna give everybody
a job to do

29:59.464 --> 30:01.000
and I expect you
to do all of it.

30:01.216 --> 30:03.003
I don't want to see
any half-assin'.

30:04.094 --> 30:05.835
Why don't you can start
by cleaning up that mess

30:06.054 --> 30:07.545
you made in Metropolis.

30:09.683 --> 30:11.299
Hey, CJ, look!

30:12.394 --> 30:13.555
Terry.

30:14.187 --> 30:15.849
Take a look at Ben Cozine.

30:19.067 --> 30:20.183
Hey, Ben.

30:21.153 --> 30:22.234
Ben!

30:22.446 --> 30:23.402
Christ.

30:23.655 --> 30:24.645
Look at him.

30:26.366 --> 30:27.823
Look, he's a twitcher.

30:31.913 --> 30:33.905
TV says you gotta shoot 'em
in the head.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.616
TV said a lot of things
that aren't true.

30:37.252 --> 30:40.165
Well, fuck the fucker.
I told him not to go downstairs.

30:59.107 --> 31:00.188
Let's go.

31:01.068 --> 31:02.104
Let's get to work.

31:04.571 --> 31:05.778
Holy shit.

31:26.927 --> 31:27.963
Let's do it.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.469
All right,
let's pick him up, then.

31:30.764 --> 31:31.845
All right.

31:32.057 --> 31:35.221
Ready? One, two, three.

31:35.435 --> 31:36.721
One two, all right?

31:37.437 --> 31:39.929
One, two.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.143
What are they?

31:45.570 --> 31:46.526
I don't know.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.146
Why are they coming here?

31:48.907 --> 31:51.069
Memory, maybe. Instinct.

31:52.619 --> 31:54.201
Maybe they're coming for us.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.208
Look over there.

32:01.420 --> 32:02.661
There's someone on the roof.

32:06.758 --> 32:07.839
Yeah, his name's Andy.

32:09.261 --> 32:10.297
He's alone.

32:12.180 --> 32:13.387
He may as well be on the moon.

32:14.641 --> 32:15.722
Poor guy.

32:19.771 --> 32:20.852
What's he pointing at?

32:23.567 --> 32:25.854
- Helicopter.
- Hey, it's coming.

32:27.446 --> 32:29.733
Fuckin' A, man!

32:29.948 --> 32:33.157
Hey!

32:36.580 --> 32:37.570
Where's he...?

32:37.789 --> 32:39.496
Please... What's he doing?
What's he...?

32:45.338 --> 32:46.419
No.

32:46.923 --> 32:48.664
No, I mean, they saw us, so...

32:49.092 --> 32:51.505
They're gonna be
coming back, baby. Don't worry.

32:51.845 --> 32:53.211
They're gonna send somebody,
something.

32:53.430 --> 32:54.546
It's safe here.

32:54.764 --> 32:56.471
We'll just wait for them
to come back.

33:16.161 --> 33:17.618
I don't want anybody
sneaking around

33:17.829 --> 33:18.990
and stealing shit.

33:22.375 --> 33:23.491
<i>Comprende?</i>

33:26.838 --> 33:27.874
Sweet dreams.

33:34.095 --> 33:36.052
Those assholes
are gonna get us killed.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.011
We have to do something.

33:41.269 --> 33:44.012
I'm not doing anything to create
problems for Luda and me.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.730
The helicopter's
coming back soon.

33:46.942 --> 33:48.058
I hope so.

33:49.486 --> 33:51.022
What's that supposed to mean?

33:51.238 --> 33:53.855
It means it might come
and it might not. We don't know.

33:54.491 --> 33:56.574
What do you mean, not come back?

33:56.785 --> 33:58.868
You said it was coming back!
We have to get to hospital.

33:59.079 --> 34:01.492
Hey, baby, listen, listen.
Don't worry, okay?

34:01.706 --> 34:04.323
This guy, he...
he doesn't know shit.

34:05.418 --> 34:07.034
All right? It's coming back.

34:08.838 --> 34:11.581
Hey, my man, you know,
I hear you talking a lot.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.335
You know,
you're always saying something.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.965
Who the fuck are you
that we should listen, huh?

34:16.179 --> 34:18.795
Were you like Special Ops?
Were you in the Marines?

34:19.014 --> 34:20.505
What the fuck do you do?

34:23.143 --> 34:25.431
I sell televisions at Best Buy.

34:30.569 --> 34:31.730
Wow.

34:33.612 --> 34:34.945
Hey, Officer,

34:35.156 --> 34:38.364
how do you like following a guy
that sells TVs?

34:38.868 --> 34:41.702
About as much as I like
following a guy who steals them.

34:44.623 --> 34:46.239
I'm not following anyone.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.663
I'm going to Fort Pastor
to get my brother.

34:51.505 --> 34:54.293
<i>They seem to need
to feed on warm flesh.</i>

34:57.596 --> 34:59.713
<i>Some basic skills remain.</i>

35:00.765 --> 35:03.382
<i>They don't seem to have much,
if any, reasoning power.</i>

35:03.977 --> 35:05.058
<i>And how does this spread?</i>

35:05.270 --> 35:06.386
These guys
are so full of shit.

35:06.688 --> 35:08.429
They're saying
the same damn thing all day.

35:08.648 --> 35:11.015
Tell me something
I don't know, asshole!

35:13.987 --> 35:16.400
<i>I've just been informed
that we're going off the air...</i>

35:16.615 --> 35:17.981
Wanna hear something
that really sucks?

35:18.199 --> 35:19.155
<i>...and switching over</i>

35:19.367 --> 35:20.733
<i>to the Emergency
Broadcasting System.</i>

35:20.952 --> 35:23.740
You know that chick
at Dairy Queen?

35:23.955 --> 35:25.617
<i>I don't know
when we'll be back on the air.</i>

35:25.832 --> 35:26.822
- The fat one?
- Yeah.

35:27.042 --> 35:28.578
<i>Until then...</i>

35:28.960 --> 35:30.371
She was coming over tonight.

35:30.712 --> 35:32.704
I would have
tapped that shit for sure.

35:32.922 --> 35:36.711
Bart, dude,
everybody's dead, okay?

35:36.926 --> 35:38.167
Your mom's dead.

35:38.386 --> 35:40.548
Your brother's dead.
That fat chick at Dairy Queen...

35:40.764 --> 35:42.346
<i>...to say a pleasure
it's been...</i>

35:42.557 --> 35:43.843
Dead.

35:44.059 --> 35:46.051
<i>...report the news
these past 26 years.</i>

35:46.269 --> 35:48.056
<i>- God bless you.
- Yeah.</i>

35:48.730 --> 35:50.767
<i>- God bless America.
- That sucks too.</i>

35:52.651 --> 35:54.438
<i>Hell is overflowing</i>

35:55.195 --> 35:56.402
<i>and Satan</i>

35:56.821 --> 35:59.029
<i>is sending his dead to us.</i>

36:01.076 --> 36:02.032
<i>Why?</i>

36:02.869 --> 36:04.110
<i>Because...</i>

36:05.580 --> 36:07.788
<i>you have sex out of wedlock,</i>

36:10.251 --> 36:12.959
<i>you kill unborn children,</i>

36:15.173 --> 36:18.792
<i>you have man-on-man relations,</i>

36:19.010 --> 36:21.548
<i>same-sex marriage.</i>

36:22.555 --> 36:24.797
<i>How do you think
your God will judge you?</i>

36:27.477 --> 36:28.684
<i>Well, friends...</i>

36:30.146 --> 36:31.307
<i>now we know.</i>

36:36.194 --> 36:39.528
<i>When there is no more room
in hell...</i>

36:41.991 --> 36:43.072
<i>the dead...</i>

36:44.035 --> 36:45.651
<i>will walk the earth.</i>

37:15.900 --> 37:17.482
What the hell?

37:26.745 --> 37:28.452
- Hey, dumb-ass.
- Hm?

37:28.663 --> 37:30.370
It's the timers.
It's eight o'clock.

37:30.582 --> 37:32.164
Terry.

37:33.877 --> 37:35.209
Go shut 'em off.

37:35.503 --> 37:36.710
It's Bart's turn.

37:38.047 --> 37:39.458
You're the trainee, man.

37:40.383 --> 37:42.750
Shit rolls downhill.

37:44.888 --> 37:46.800
I wish somebody
was working at Hallowed Grounds.

37:49.309 --> 37:50.845
How hard is it to make
a cup of coffee?

37:51.436 --> 37:53.553
I wanted a soy mocha latte
with foam.

37:55.565 --> 37:56.601
Faggot.

38:01.988 --> 38:03.195
What are you doing?

38:08.870 --> 38:10.077
What's the news?

38:11.247 --> 38:12.283
Bad.

38:19.005 --> 38:19.961
Hey. Hey!

38:22.091 --> 38:23.252
Hey.

38:24.302 --> 38:25.338
What?

38:27.013 --> 38:29.300
The bathroom in here is fake,
it doesn't work.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.226
I'll tell CJ.

38:35.438 --> 38:36.554
I'm telling you.

38:58.795 --> 39:00.536
You're the type of cat
that goes to church

39:00.755 --> 39:02.212
and all that kind of shit,
right?

39:02.924 --> 39:04.540
Yeah,
I do all that kind of shit.

39:08.513 --> 39:09.754
So what do you think?

39:10.890 --> 39:11.926
Hm?

39:12.392 --> 39:14.475
What is this?
Is this the end of times?

39:16.229 --> 39:18.186
'Cause if it is,
I'm telling you, I'm fucked.

39:19.774 --> 39:22.232
I'm serious. I've done
some bad things in my life.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.024
Oh, I get it.

39:26.239 --> 39:27.946
You saw hell yesterday,

39:28.157 --> 39:29.364
now you're scared
of going to hell

39:29.576 --> 39:30.908
for all the bad things
you've done.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.906
I'll tell you what,
go in the stall,

39:33.121 --> 39:34.237
say five Hail Marys,

39:34.455 --> 39:37.493
wipe your ass, and you
and God can call it even.

39:47.969 --> 39:49.881
You think I feel
like I deserve to be here?

39:50.096 --> 39:51.587
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, I don't.

39:52.974 --> 39:54.260
And I'm cool with that.

39:54.809 --> 39:56.141
But, you see, that's not it,

39:56.811 --> 39:59.303
'cause I feel like I'm here
for another reason.

40:00.899 --> 40:04.688
I feel like I'm here
to bring that baby on this earth

40:05.820 --> 40:08.403
and give it everything
that I never had.

40:12.785 --> 40:16.278
I just want the opportunity
to change things.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.229
Shit!

40:52.700 --> 40:53.907
CJ!

40:55.161 --> 40:56.322
How did you get out?

40:56.537 --> 40:58.199
Who gave you permission
to loot the goddamn stores?

40:58.414 --> 40:59.575
What are we gonna do
about that truck?

40:59.791 --> 41:01.783
We're not gonna do anything
about that truck.

41:02.001 --> 41:02.912
There's people in it.

41:03.127 --> 41:04.584
Yeah? And how do you know
they're not fucked up

41:04.796 --> 41:06.128
like everybody else out there?

41:06.339 --> 41:08.376
Well, for one thing,
they're driving a truck.

41:08.591 --> 41:11.083
Oh, and shooting guns.

41:11.302 --> 41:12.668
If we start letting people
in here,

41:12.887 --> 41:14.344
we're gonna
let the wrong ones in

41:14.555 --> 41:16.547
and then I'm dead,
and I don't want to die.

41:17.392 --> 41:19.679
- Who are the wrong ones?
- Nobody here is sick.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.640
I intend on keeping it that way.

41:21.854 --> 41:22.765
I just think...

41:23.022 --> 41:24.433
I did not ask
for your opinion, lady!

41:24.649 --> 41:26.436
If you want to argue,
argue with this.

41:26.651 --> 41:29.234
- Hey, take it easy.
- Shut your fucking mouth.

41:31.322 --> 41:32.403
Get the gun out of my face.

41:32.615 --> 41:34.607
You can't turn them away, CJ.
You'll kill them.

41:35.118 --> 41:37.531
Tough shit. Self-defense.

41:39.372 --> 41:41.455
- I'm not killing anybody.
- Know what? I'll kill you.

41:41.666 --> 41:43.498
No, no, Stop it, CJ.
Don't do this.

41:43.710 --> 41:44.746
Shut up!

41:45.211 --> 41:46.327
I'll kill each
and every one of you

41:46.546 --> 41:47.457
to stay alive,
you hear me?

41:47.672 --> 41:49.709
Get the fucking gun
out of my face!

41:49.924 --> 41:51.836
Oh. You got quite
a mouth on you.

41:52.051 --> 41:54.043
Somebody should show her
how to use it.

42:01.269 --> 42:02.555
Is there a holding cell
in there?

42:03.855 --> 42:05.938
Yeah. Back of the security room.

42:06.149 --> 42:07.435
That's real good, man.

42:07.734 --> 42:09.566
You're gonna get us all killed,
dumb-ass!

42:10.111 --> 42:11.352
Fucking traitor.

42:12.030 --> 42:13.271
- Get off me.
- Hey.

42:14.782 --> 42:16.489
I hope you got a good plan.

42:18.411 --> 42:19.322
Come on.

42:33.092 --> 42:36.881
- Hey! Hurry!
- Through here. Down here.

42:42.935 --> 42:44.267
I can't see
a damn thing.

42:44.479 --> 42:45.560
Me, either.

42:49.442 --> 42:50.808
Why is he backing up the truck?

43:01.913 --> 43:03.154
- Through here!
- Hey!

43:07.251 --> 43:08.332
Shit.

43:09.045 --> 43:10.286
What the fuck?

43:11.464 --> 43:12.420
We gotta go out there.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.707
You better throw that bullshit
right out of your head.

43:14.926 --> 43:17.134
I'm not going back out there.
That's not part of the plan.

43:17.345 --> 43:19.632
Change of plan.
I'm gonna open the door.

43:19.847 --> 43:21.588
- No.
- Okay.

43:22.225 --> 43:23.682
One, two...

43:23.893 --> 43:25.429
- Don't do it, man.
- ...three.

43:27.522 --> 43:28.854
Come on, man.

43:29.649 --> 43:30.639
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

43:35.863 --> 43:37.695
Shoot 'em in the head!

43:38.491 --> 43:39.948
I don't see anybody.

43:41.327 --> 43:43.535
- Get back inside. They're fine!
- Get back inside!

43:43.746 --> 43:44.907
Here you go.

43:45.206 --> 43:47.619
There are six more people
inside the truck!

43:47.959 --> 43:50.167
Andre, look!

44:07.895 --> 44:08.885
Thank God.

44:09.105 --> 44:11.222
I couldn't stay
in that fucking truck anymore.

44:14.819 --> 44:15.980
All right, anybody
who's injured,

44:16.195 --> 44:17.231
let's get you into Metropolis,

44:17.446 --> 44:19.108
right away,
I'll take a look at you.

44:19.323 --> 44:20.655
Let me take a look at her.

44:22.952 --> 44:24.739
Can you help me...
What's your name? Sorry.

44:24.954 --> 44:26.741
Uh, Glen. Yeah, sure.

44:26.956 --> 44:29.243
Just give me a second
to collect myself, okay?

44:29.458 --> 44:31.541
- Thanks.
- Okay.

44:32.003 --> 44:33.289
If you want to wait for me
in there,

44:33.504 --> 44:34.915
I'll take a look at your leg.

44:36.132 --> 44:37.213
Can you hold this?

44:37.425 --> 44:38.916
Yeah. We're just going
right there.

44:39.135 --> 44:41.127
Oh, my arm.

44:41.345 --> 44:43.507
It's okay, ma'am. We'll make you
nice and comfortable.

44:43.723 --> 44:45.965
The rest of you, we've got
plenty of food and water.

44:46.893 --> 44:49.260
Help should be along soon.

44:49.979 --> 44:52.016
Help? Did you hear that
from the same jackass

44:52.273 --> 44:53.764
who told us
to go to St. Verbena?

44:53.983 --> 44:55.815
- The church downtown?
- Yeah.

44:56.027 --> 44:57.063
It's the first place I went.

44:57.278 --> 44:59.235
Some dipshit on the radio
said it was safe there.

44:59.447 --> 45:00.358
He was wrong.

45:01.282 --> 45:03.194
Is that where
you picked them up?

45:03.409 --> 45:05.366
Well, I got this call on the CB
from that guy Glen,

45:05.578 --> 45:07.535
saying all these folks
were in the chapel.

45:09.123 --> 45:10.113
He's a priest?

45:10.666 --> 45:11.782
No, he plays the organ.

45:12.001 --> 45:13.788
I was in the neighborhood
so I picked them up.

45:16.130 --> 45:17.086
Well done.

45:18.007 --> 45:18.963
Thanks.

45:19.175 --> 45:20.757
Hey, I'm sorry, excuse me,

45:20.968 --> 45:23.585
when you two fellows
are done blowing each other,

45:23.804 --> 45:26.137
maybe Davy Crockett
can tell us the deal here.

45:27.642 --> 45:29.508
Well, we haven't heard much
since the TVs went down...

45:29.727 --> 45:32.936
- Excuse me. Whose rig is that?
- It's mine.

45:33.564 --> 45:36.728
- You mind if I borrow it?
- I'm not using it, officer.

45:36.943 --> 45:39.105
- Keys?
- They're in the cab.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.528
The truck's not gonna make it
to Fort Pastor.

45:41.739 --> 45:42.775
No, forget the truck.

45:42.990 --> 45:45.733
That place is fucked, man.
Bloodbath city.

45:45.952 --> 45:47.113
How do you know?

45:47.328 --> 45:48.694
We just came from there.

45:50.122 --> 45:51.238
Is everyone there dead?

45:51.457 --> 45:52.618
Dead-ish.

45:54.460 --> 45:56.452
Is everyone there dead?

45:56.796 --> 45:59.083
Yeah. In the sense
that they all...

45:59.423 --> 46:01.710
sort of fell down and then...

46:01.926 --> 46:03.883
- I'll look for myself.
- You're not gonna make it.

46:04.095 --> 46:06.337
- ...got up and...
- I'll get as far as I can.

46:06.555 --> 46:07.466
Right now it's about one foot...

46:07.682 --> 46:08.843
...started eating each other.

46:09.058 --> 46:10.594
- I'll take my chances.
- Don't be an idiot.

46:14.230 --> 46:16.813
Please. There's people here
right now could use your help.

46:19.110 --> 46:20.146
Fuck y'all.

46:24.365 --> 46:27.403
It's nice to see that you've all
bonded through this disaster.

47:39.982 --> 47:42.395
Hey. You, uh, need anything?

47:42.610 --> 47:43.851
No, we're fine.
Don't worry about us.

47:44.070 --> 47:45.151
He's got a bite on his hand.

47:47.114 --> 47:48.321
Yeah.

47:53.245 --> 47:56.238
She's cold.

47:56.457 --> 47:57.493
That's good, right?

47:57.708 --> 48:00.621
I don't know. It's weird.

48:01.837 --> 48:03.248
I've never seen an infection
this bad

48:03.464 --> 48:04.671
that didn't come with a fever.

48:06.801 --> 48:08.758
That guy's arm looks
pretty bad over there.

48:08.969 --> 48:10.380
You should probably
check it out.

48:12.181 --> 48:14.093
All right.
Stay with her for a minute.

48:18.646 --> 48:20.182
Here, let me take
a look at that.

48:20.398 --> 48:21.980
I'm fine, really.

48:22.441 --> 48:23.773
They don't hurt much at all.

48:23.984 --> 48:25.316
Tucker could use you
more than I could.

48:25.653 --> 48:27.269
His ankle's cut pretty bad.

48:27.905 --> 48:29.316
I'm just gonna
clean it up a bit.

48:30.491 --> 48:31.777
You okay?

48:32.827 --> 48:35.911
Ma'am, can I get you something?
Like a glass of water?

48:40.501 --> 48:42.493
Ana! Ana, come here!

49:08.529 --> 49:09.770
Anyone know her name?

49:13.325 --> 49:14.736
Died without a name?

49:16.412 --> 49:17.493
Damn.

49:18.289 --> 49:20.326
Guys, do you wanna move
into the other room?

49:25.629 --> 49:26.915
Holy shit!

49:42.980 --> 49:44.061
Holy shit.

49:46.609 --> 49:47.645
Holy shit.

49:53.240 --> 49:54.321
I think it's the bites.

49:55.910 --> 49:57.276
Frank said she was
walking on her own

49:57.495 --> 49:59.157
when she got in the truck
five hours ago.

50:00.247 --> 50:01.363
The bites killed her.

50:01.707 --> 50:03.198
The bites brought her back.

50:03.459 --> 50:04.290
How do you know?

50:04.835 --> 50:07.327
I watched it happen.
I felt her pulse, she was gone.

50:07.713 --> 50:08.703
Then...

50:09.715 --> 50:11.581
Yesterday I saw
the same thing to somebody else.

50:14.303 --> 50:16.135
I think that's why
it spread so fast.

50:19.308 --> 50:20.264
All right.

50:23.521 --> 50:25.478
So who else
in the group is bitten?

50:26.106 --> 50:27.142
Frank for sure.

50:27.358 --> 50:28.894
What about the one
with the foot?

50:29.318 --> 50:31.651
Tucker? He says no, he fell.

50:32.404 --> 50:34.646
So it's Frank. Tall guy, right?

50:34.865 --> 50:36.231
Right. So we have to
quarantine him

50:36.492 --> 50:37.653
right away.

50:37.993 --> 50:39.575
Where exactly do we do that?

50:39.870 --> 50:42.157
I don't know. There must be
some place to keep him in here.

50:42.373 --> 50:43.409
Then what?

50:45.000 --> 50:46.536
I don't know. But...

50:47.545 --> 50:49.582
It's too dangerous
to keep him around here.

50:53.801 --> 50:55.713
I'm sorry,
what are we talking about here?

50:55.928 --> 50:57.419
Are we talking about
killing him?

50:57.846 --> 50:59.303
Would you rather we waited
for him to die

50:59.515 --> 51:00.505
and then he tries to kill us?

51:00.724 --> 51:02.386
Yes. No. You can't kill him.

51:02.601 --> 51:03.842
- Ana...
- He's got a daughter!

51:04.061 --> 51:05.017
I'm sorry.

51:06.939 --> 51:08.680
I don't think there's
any other choice.

51:12.069 --> 51:13.105
He's right.

51:16.031 --> 51:17.897
You can't do this.
What if I'm wrong?

51:18.075 --> 51:19.657
You've seen it happen before.

51:24.123 --> 51:25.239
Frank?

51:26.292 --> 51:27.749
Michael's coming to shoot you.

51:29.169 --> 51:30.376
What are you talking about?

51:30.588 --> 51:31.874
You're infected.

51:33.090 --> 51:34.456
You're going to become
one of them.

51:36.719 --> 51:38.130
Is this true?

51:39.138 --> 51:40.379
Are you here to kill me?

51:41.890 --> 51:43.927
You've been bitten.
It's only a matter of time.

51:44.143 --> 51:45.759
No. No. No.

51:45.978 --> 51:47.719
Leave my dad alone. Go away.

51:47.938 --> 51:49.600
You can't do this.

51:51.483 --> 51:53.691
You have to understand
that she's lost everyone.

51:56.196 --> 51:57.186
Her mother,

51:57.781 --> 51:59.067
her two brothers.

52:01.785 --> 52:03.151
I'm all she's got.

52:07.166 --> 52:08.452
Well, Michael,
what are you waiting for?

52:10.044 --> 52:11.660
Go ahead. Kill him.

52:14.214 --> 52:15.546
Hey, kill Tucker, too.

52:16.300 --> 52:18.041
Wait a minute. I was never bit.

52:18.427 --> 52:19.463
We can't be sure.

52:20.012 --> 52:21.344
Do it, Michael.

52:23.766 --> 52:25.007
Are you sure it's the bite?

52:25.851 --> 52:26.887
No.

52:28.520 --> 52:29.681
She's sure.

52:35.819 --> 52:36.900
I'm sorry.

53:05.182 --> 53:06.798
- Hey.
- Hi.

53:08.102 --> 53:09.092
Are you okay?

53:09.311 --> 53:10.301
Mm.

53:10.521 --> 53:11.728
Let me see your arm.

53:12.773 --> 53:14.014
It hurts.

53:14.525 --> 53:16.107
It's already starting to heal.

53:16.819 --> 53:19.653
Andre, I can't have baby here.

53:19.863 --> 53:20.979
Why not?

53:21.198 --> 53:23.485
People have been having babies
for millions of years,

53:23.701 --> 53:26.114
all on their own, no hospitals.

53:26.495 --> 53:27.576
Wait.

53:28.497 --> 53:30.079
- Oh, yeah.
- It's moving.

53:30.290 --> 53:31.497
I felt it.

53:31.709 --> 53:33.917
We gotta come up with a name
for this baby.

53:34.128 --> 53:35.039
I want Russian name.

53:35.421 --> 53:37.287
Don't start that again.
African name.

53:37.506 --> 53:39.668
- Please?
- Come here and give me a hug.

53:47.391 --> 53:48.677
Sweetie.

53:50.853 --> 53:52.264
I'm so proud of you.

53:57.109 --> 53:59.692
I couldn't ask for anything more
in a daughter.

54:09.955 --> 54:11.116
I love you.

54:14.293 --> 54:15.625
I love you too.

54:22.968 --> 54:24.175
Time to go, honey.

54:24.386 --> 54:25.467
No.

55:10.015 --> 55:11.847
Terry, come on, man,
open the door.

55:12.059 --> 55:13.175
Shut up.

55:13.936 --> 55:15.472
Come on, man,
don't tell me to shut up.

55:15.687 --> 55:16.768
Just come open the door.

55:17.356 --> 55:19.689
I got you this job. Come on.

55:36.250 --> 55:37.582
You want...

55:40.254 --> 55:41.415
every...

55:44.716 --> 55:46.252
single second.

56:13.203 --> 56:14.660
Ana.

56:18.417 --> 56:19.658
I'm glad you didn't do it.

58:05.482 --> 58:06.814
Fuck me harder!

58:25.419 --> 58:26.660
Okay, here's a good one.

58:26.878 --> 58:29.461
Top ten ingredients
to a successful relationship.

58:32.342 --> 58:34.174
All right, I'm gonna skip
to the top three.

58:34.511 --> 58:37.504
Number three,
"He listens to me."

58:37.973 --> 58:40.716
Number two,
"He tells me he loves me."

58:41.143 --> 58:42.805
And number one.

58:44.688 --> 58:48.227
Well, it's trust.
Number one is trust.

58:53.780 --> 58:56.238
Holy shit.

58:57.117 --> 58:58.107
He got him.

59:04.541 --> 59:06.453
So, who do we have next?

59:07.044 --> 59:08.626
Uh...

59:11.173 --> 59:13.005
Yeah. Burt Reynolds.

59:13.216 --> 59:15.708
Tell him, uh...
tell him to get Burt Reynolds.

59:32.527 --> 59:33.608
My goodness.

59:33.820 --> 59:35.561
Man, he's good.

59:35.781 --> 59:37.363
It barely even looked like him.

59:38.450 --> 59:40.362
Oh, oh... um...

59:41.161 --> 59:43.118
Rosie O'Donnell.
Tell him to get Rosie.

59:43.330 --> 59:44.320
Yeah, Rosie.

59:44.539 --> 59:46.701
Nah, too easy.
Give him something hard.

59:47.334 --> 59:49.200
You guys had really
rough childhoods, didn't you?

59:49.503 --> 59:50.710
A little bit rocky?

59:50.921 --> 59:53.129
Hey, sweetheart,

59:54.216 --> 59:55.377
let me tell you something.

59:55.926 --> 59:57.633
You, uh, you have my permission,

59:57.844 --> 59:59.380
if I ever turn into
one of those things,

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:02.050
do me a favor,
blow my fucking head off.

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:03.972
Oh, yeah, you can count on that.

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:12.352
I guess the first time
I knew I was gay...

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:15.271
I was 13.

01:00:16.404 --> 01:00:17.440
This guy...

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:20.113
Todd,

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:24.152
he was building a deck
in our backyard...

01:00:24.371 --> 01:00:25.737
Uh, uh, Okay.

01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:28.202
Just, please, stop.

01:00:31.294 --> 01:00:34.287
I remember he had
the most astonishing blue eyes.

01:00:34.506 --> 01:00:36.873
Oh, my God! I'm in hell.

01:00:45.392 --> 01:00:46.883
Hey, Andre, how's Luda doing?

01:00:47.269 --> 01:00:48.305
She's fine.

01:00:48.728 --> 01:00:50.219
Hey, where's that lemon stuff?

01:00:51.106 --> 01:00:52.096
It's all gone.

01:00:52.482 --> 01:00:54.098
Steve likes to put
it in his booze.

01:00:56.236 --> 01:00:57.568
Try the vanilla stuff.

01:00:58.822 --> 01:00:59.903
All right.

01:01:00.282 --> 01:01:01.489
I'd like to drop by

01:01:01.783 --> 01:01:03.524
and check on her,
and just see how she's doing.

01:01:03.743 --> 01:01:05.109
No, thanks. She's fine.

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:07.570
- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

01:01:09.040 --> 01:01:10.497
It's okay, hon. We understand.

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:19.999
Thanks.

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:39.360
And before that,
I worked in a stationery store.

01:01:39.571 --> 01:01:40.857
And I drove a snowplow.

01:01:41.823 --> 01:01:43.155
Fixed copiers.

01:01:43.450 --> 01:01:45.112
God, it's such a shame

01:01:45.327 --> 01:01:47.740
that this whole end-of-the-world
thing's holding you back.

01:01:52.918 --> 01:01:54.534
- Okay, worst job.
- Oh.

01:01:59.216 --> 01:02:01.503
I know which job
I was the worst at.

01:02:02.135 --> 01:02:03.501
It was being a husband.

01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:04.798
That's not a job.

01:02:05.013 --> 01:02:07.426
It sure is.

01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:09.633
You guys just haven't met
the right girl.

01:02:10.602 --> 01:02:12.685
Yeah, I tried it
three times and...

01:02:13.313 --> 01:02:15.179
I got pink slips every time.

01:02:16.816 --> 01:02:18.023
What were you best at?

01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:25.238
Being a dad.

01:02:28.787 --> 01:02:30.278
I think I was best at that.

01:02:41.174 --> 01:02:42.915
- Everybody calm down.
- Are they inside?

01:02:43.134 --> 01:02:44.466
No. Does this place
have generators?

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:53.509
Shh. Okay, shh.

01:02:53.728 --> 01:02:56.937
Shhh. It's all right, baby.

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:03.436
Shh.

01:03:13.081 --> 01:03:15.573
Baby, please.
You got to be quiet, okay?

01:03:17.585 --> 01:03:18.701
It's gonna be all right.

01:03:19.421 --> 01:03:20.662
Our baby is on the way.

01:03:21.172 --> 01:03:22.208
It's coming.

01:03:24.718 --> 01:03:25.834
That's it.

01:03:26.970 --> 01:03:28.882
It's in employee parking
level three.

01:03:29.514 --> 01:03:31.426
They keep them in a pen
near the parking shuttles.

01:03:32.350 --> 01:03:33.340
Have fun.

01:03:33.685 --> 01:03:36.018
Hey, wait a minute.
You're coming too.

01:03:36.855 --> 01:03:37.766
No, I'm not.

01:03:37.981 --> 01:03:39.438
I said I'd tell you
where the generators are.

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:40.605
I never said I'd show you.

01:03:40.817 --> 01:03:42.774
Did you think I'd just leave you
two up here?

01:03:42.986 --> 01:03:45.353
You come with me
or you go back in that cell.

01:03:51.328 --> 01:03:52.364
All right.

01:03:53.538 --> 01:03:55.029
I ain't going anywhere
without a gun.

01:03:57.625 --> 01:03:58.957
You're not getting a gun.

01:03:59.794 --> 01:04:00.910
Trust.

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:03.583
The primary ingredient
in any relationship.

01:04:08.219 --> 01:04:09.300
Have at 'em, cowboy.

01:04:11.222 --> 01:04:12.258
Asshole.

01:04:16.102 --> 01:04:17.388
Bart, get the chains.

01:04:28.573 --> 01:04:29.734
You ready to roll?

01:04:30.158 --> 01:04:31.615
You're coming with us?

01:04:31.951 --> 01:04:33.317
No, you're coming with me.

01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:35.703
I've done this before.

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:39.327
Know how to use that?

01:04:41.294 --> 01:04:43.160
This one's the dangerous end,
right?

01:04:46.674 --> 01:04:48.085
Now it is.

01:05:13.201 --> 01:05:15.238
This is level one.
We gotta walk down to three.

01:06:09.841 --> 01:06:10.797
What the fuck was that?

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:12.545
I just saw something.

01:06:13.178 --> 01:06:14.919
You didn't see shit, Bart.
Shut the fuck up.

01:06:27.066 --> 01:06:29.399
Oh, shit. Here it comes.

01:06:38.119 --> 01:06:39.280
Jesus Christ.

01:06:40.747 --> 01:06:41.908
It's a fucking dog.

01:06:42.540 --> 01:06:43.576
Come here, boy.

01:06:48.379 --> 01:06:49.586
At least we know nothing's
down here

01:06:49.797 --> 01:06:50.753
or it would've eaten him.

01:06:50.965 --> 01:06:52.672
See? I told you I saw something.

01:06:54.135 --> 01:06:56.127
What's wrong, boy?

01:06:56.387 --> 01:06:59.551
There's nothing wrong.
That dog's just fucked up.

01:07:14.781 --> 01:07:15.942
Run!

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:22.077
Wait, CJ! Wait up! Wait!

01:07:23.081 --> 01:07:24.447
It's locked!
It's fucking locked!

01:07:32.465 --> 01:07:34.001
Come on, let's go!

01:07:45.186 --> 01:07:46.267
CJ!

01:08:02.412 --> 01:08:03.698
I'm out!

01:08:13.965 --> 01:08:15.797
CJ! Matches!

01:08:48.957 --> 01:08:50.165
Breathe.

01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:52.542
You're doing good. Breathe.

01:08:53.004 --> 01:08:57.122
You're doing good, baby.

01:09:25.536 --> 01:09:26.697
I'm sorry.

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:55.991
- Thanks.
- Okay. That's the last.

01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:58.831
I'm gonna go check on Luda.
I haven't seen her in a while.

01:10:59.046 --> 01:11:00.412
- I'll go.
- You sure?

01:11:00.631 --> 01:11:02.088
Yeah. I'll take them
some candles.

01:11:02.300 --> 01:11:03.211
Okay.

01:11:03.426 --> 01:11:04.587
Let me know
if they need anything.

01:11:04.802 --> 01:11:06.009
Okay. I'll have a smoke
on the way.

01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:08.299
- See you.
- Bye.

01:11:12.393 --> 01:11:13.634
It's coming.

01:11:17.857 --> 01:11:18.938
I see it.

01:11:55.728 --> 01:11:57.060
Guys?

01:12:10.993 --> 01:12:12.279
Oh, my God.

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:19.415
It's a girl.

01:12:35.685 --> 01:12:37.142
You want to kill Luda?

01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:42.222
You want to kill my family?

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:37.114
Norma! Come on, Norma.

01:13:38.414 --> 01:13:39.370
What happened?

01:13:40.583 --> 01:13:43.496
The son of a bitch shot me.

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:50.461
Get away from her.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.797
Wait. Just wait.

01:13:55.431 --> 01:13:56.797
She died of the gunshot.

01:13:58.476 --> 01:13:59.592
She wasn't bitten.

01:14:01.312 --> 01:14:02.644
She's gonna wake up though,
right?

01:14:05.816 --> 01:14:06.897
No.

01:14:08.736 --> 01:14:10.819
No, if she was one of them,
she'd be up by now.

01:14:43.145 --> 01:14:44.932
- Terry?
- Yeah.

01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:46.392
Hold this.

01:14:55.700 --> 01:14:56.861
Oh, God.

01:15:24.937 --> 01:15:26.348
Somebody should say something.

01:15:26.731 --> 01:15:27.687
Yeah.

01:15:28.065 --> 01:15:29.101
Glen?

01:15:29.942 --> 01:15:30.898
No.

01:15:31.986 --> 01:15:33.227
You worked in the church.

01:15:35.781 --> 01:15:36.862
I played the organ.

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:38.906
Come on,
you must have heard the priest

01:15:39.118 --> 01:15:40.484
say something
about life and death.

01:15:42.079 --> 01:15:43.160
It was a job.

01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:45.246
I don't believe in God.

01:15:46.876 --> 01:15:48.367
I don't see how anyone could.

01:15:50.796 --> 01:15:52.207
Somebody should say something.

01:15:55.760 --> 01:15:57.046
There's nothing to say.

01:15:59.597 --> 01:16:01.259
I've been to a lot of funerals.

01:16:03.100 --> 01:16:04.181
I've folded the flag

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:07.352
and given it to a lot of
wives and fathers and kids,

01:16:08.314 --> 01:16:10.101
and I told them how sorry I was.

01:16:11.525 --> 01:16:13.266
But that's not what
I was really feeling.

01:16:14.695 --> 01:16:16.061
In the back of my mind,

01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:19.193
I was always saying,
"Better them than me."

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:22.742
But I don't believe that now.

01:16:23.954 --> 01:16:25.286
Because now I realize

01:16:25.498 --> 01:16:27.410
that there are some things
worse than death

01:16:27.625 --> 01:16:30.163
and one of them is sitting here
waiting to die.

01:16:35.007 --> 01:16:36.293
I don't want to die here.

01:16:43.891 --> 01:16:45.974
I saw a couple of buses
in the garage.

01:16:46.519 --> 01:16:48.010
We could fix them up,
we could reinforce them,

01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:49.970
then get as far from here
as possible.

01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:51.725
And then what?

01:16:51.941 --> 01:16:53.523
Oh, I have an idea. Um...

01:16:54.151 --> 01:16:57.110
While we're at it,
why don't we swing by the marina

01:16:57.321 --> 01:16:59.153
and hop in my boat
and take it

01:16:59.406 --> 01:17:01.864
for a pleasure cruise,
you jackasses.

01:17:02.576 --> 01:17:04.317
Wait a minute.
That's a good idea.

01:17:04.537 --> 01:17:05.448
There's islands in the lakes,

01:17:05.663 --> 01:17:06.904
there's not a lot of people
on them.

01:17:07.289 --> 01:17:08.154
I was kidding.

01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:10.411
How far is the marina?

01:17:10.626 --> 01:17:12.208
Oh, my God.

01:17:13.170 --> 01:17:14.377
You're serious?

01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:16.542
I think it's a damn good idea.

01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:19.082
How about the rest of you?

01:17:20.427 --> 01:17:21.383
Kenneth?

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:23.424
Yeah, it's a good idea.

01:17:23.889 --> 01:17:25.801
We have to pick up Andy.
He's part of the group.

01:17:26.016 --> 01:17:28.099
Excuse me.

01:17:28.310 --> 01:17:29.972
Not to shit
on anyone's riff here

01:17:30.187 --> 01:17:32.224
but let me see
if I grasp this concept, okay?

01:17:32.439 --> 01:17:35.273
You're suggesting that we take
some fucking parking shuttles,

01:17:35.484 --> 01:17:37.271
and reinforce them
with some aluminum siding

01:17:37.486 --> 01:17:38.977
and then head over
to the gun store

01:17:39.196 --> 01:17:40.403
where we watch
our good friend Andy

01:17:40.614 --> 01:17:41.650
play some cowboy-movie,

01:17:41.866 --> 01:17:43.573
jump-on-the-wagon bullshit.

01:17:43.868 --> 01:17:45.951
Then we're gonna drive
across a ruined city

01:17:46.162 --> 01:17:47.278
through a welcome committee

01:17:47.496 --> 01:17:48.737
of a few hundred thousand
dead cannibals,

01:17:48.956 --> 01:17:50.492
all so we can sail off
into the sunset

01:17:50.708 --> 01:17:52.074
on this fucking asshole's boat?

01:17:52.626 --> 01:17:54.208
And head for some island

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:55.911
that for all we know
which may not even exist?

01:17:57.298 --> 01:17:58.334
Yeah.

01:17:59.300 --> 01:18:00.381
Pretty much, yeah.

01:18:05.306 --> 01:18:06.262
Yeah.

01:18:08.601 --> 01:18:09.557
Okay.

01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:13.936
I'm in.

01:19:21.423 --> 01:19:23.665
We have 12 of these
shotgun shells,

01:19:24.218 --> 01:19:26.335
twenty-six of those
pussy.9-Mils,

01:19:26.929 --> 01:19:29.592
and 16 of those.357 Magnums.

01:19:30.307 --> 01:19:32.014
Yeah, well,
that's still not very much,

01:19:32.226 --> 01:19:34.058
so hopefully we'll get
to the dock

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:35.681
and there won't be
too many of them.

01:19:35.896 --> 01:19:36.852
Hm.

01:19:37.064 --> 01:19:38.851
Nice to see you busting
your ass today.

01:19:39.108 --> 01:19:41.942
Oh, that's sarcasm.
That is awesome.

01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:44.857
Yeah, you know,
I would love to help

01:19:45.072 --> 01:19:46.153
but, uh...

01:19:46.448 --> 01:19:48.815
a captain never works
alongside his men.

01:19:50.953 --> 01:19:52.364
You guys have a good one.

01:19:54.248 --> 01:19:55.705
What a total dick.

01:19:57.293 --> 01:19:58.750
Guys, where did Chips go?

01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:00.627
Chips?

01:20:00.838 --> 01:20:01.919
Where'd you go, Chips?

01:20:02.131 --> 01:20:04.248
I can't find him. Chips?
Come here. Come on, Chips!

01:20:04.466 --> 01:20:07.174
- "Come on, Chips!"
- Where'd you go, honey?

01:20:07.386 --> 01:20:08.467
Come on, boy.

01:20:10.514 --> 01:20:12.847
Oh, there you are. Come on.

01:20:13.058 --> 01:20:15.766
There's my boy. Don't you
ever leave me again, okay?

01:20:15.978 --> 01:20:16.968
Ever, ever.

01:20:44.715 --> 01:20:47.082
Hey. Kenneth wants everyone
upstairs for a meeting.

01:20:47.301 --> 01:20:49.384
Come in here first.
I want you to see this.

01:20:54.892 --> 01:20:56.349
When those things
are on the side of the bus,

01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:57.676
this'll get them off.

01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:01.141
Cool, huh?

01:21:02.566 --> 01:21:03.647
Wow.

01:21:05.027 --> 01:21:06.188
That might be
the most romantic thing

01:21:06.403 --> 01:21:07.519
anyone's ever shown me.

01:21:13.035 --> 01:21:14.276
I'm trying here.

01:21:16.413 --> 01:21:17.494
Yeah, I know.

01:21:33.764 --> 01:21:35.676
It's not just about
him starving, Steve.

01:21:35.891 --> 01:21:37.803
If we go to pick him up and
he doesn't have his strength,

01:21:38.018 --> 01:21:40.135
then we're gonna be
carrying him. It's...

01:21:40.479 --> 01:21:41.469
She's right.

01:21:41.688 --> 01:21:43.429
He's a hell of a shot too.
We're gonna need him.

01:21:43.649 --> 01:21:45.106
I'm not saying
we don't need him.

01:21:45.317 --> 01:21:47.058
There's no point
in arguing about this.

01:21:47.277 --> 01:21:48.188
We need a solution.

01:21:48.404 --> 01:21:49.611
We need to get some food
over there.

01:21:49.822 --> 01:21:50.858
I have an idea.

01:21:51.073 --> 01:21:53.611
We draw straws and the loser
runs across with a ham sandwich.

01:21:55.035 --> 01:21:56.151
Could you be
a bigger prick?

01:21:56.370 --> 01:21:57.986
I think so
but that's irrelevant.

01:21:58.205 --> 01:22:00.572
My question to you is
what's your plan?

01:22:00.874 --> 01:22:02.081
Come on!

01:22:05.796 --> 01:22:06.627
I got it.

01:22:06.839 --> 01:22:07.920
We've got to get over there
anyway...

01:22:08.132 --> 01:22:10.169
- Shut up!
- ...more ammunition, all right?

01:22:12.428 --> 01:22:13.589
I have an idea.

01:22:14.179 --> 01:22:16.091
Stop, it's hurting him!
No! He's not safe!

01:22:16.306 --> 01:22:18.263
Nicole, they're not interested
in him, I promise.

01:22:18.475 --> 01:22:20.057
Okay, they want us, okay?

01:22:20.477 --> 01:22:22.093
Chips is gonna be fine.

01:22:31.447 --> 01:22:33.939
See? Look, he's walking
right by them.

01:22:34.158 --> 01:22:35.490
They're not even
paying attention to him.

01:22:38.328 --> 01:22:39.535
The walkie's
in the bag?

01:22:39.746 --> 01:22:41.032
Yeah.

01:22:44.209 --> 01:22:46.542
Let me see. Let me see!

01:22:51.675 --> 01:22:53.541
There he is.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.592
Good boy. Good boy, Chips.

01:22:57.931 --> 01:23:00.389
- Okay, he's there, he's in.
- Give me those.

01:23:03.479 --> 01:23:04.765
Oh, man.

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:06.812
- What? What?
- No.

01:23:07.065 --> 01:23:09.933
No. Oh, man. They got him.
They got him!

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:22.204
I'll try him on the radio.
Andy. Andy, do you copy?

01:23:23.207 --> 01:23:24.539
Andy, can you hear me?

01:23:26.543 --> 01:23:27.704
Andy?

01:23:29.171 --> 01:23:31.333
<i>Can you hear me? Hello?</i>

01:23:31.548 --> 01:23:32.709
<i>This thing working?</i>

01:23:32.925 --> 01:23:36.509
<i>I'm dinged up pretty bad
but I think I'm gonna be okay.</i>

01:23:37.137 --> 01:23:38.253
Where are you hurt, Andy?

01:23:38.472 --> 01:23:40.464
<i>Goddamn,
those bastards bite hard.</i>

01:23:43.101 --> 01:23:45.013
<i>I just have to stop
the bleeding.</i>

01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:47.016
<i>It's really going.</i>

01:23:47.231 --> 01:23:49.769
<i>Easy, boy. Easy. Is this Ken?</i>

01:23:50.484 --> 01:23:51.850
<i>Is that you, man?</i>

01:23:54.238 --> 01:23:55.354
Yeah, it's me, brother.

01:23:55.572 --> 01:23:57.905
<i>Hey, man,
good to hear your voice.</i>

01:23:58.116 --> 01:24:00.324
<i>I guess we're gonna meet
up-close pretty soon, huh?</i>

01:24:00.661 --> 01:24:02.277
<i>Oh, shit, hang on.</i>

01:24:03.413 --> 01:24:05.450
<i>Ah, Jesus. He got me good.</i>

01:24:06.124 --> 01:24:07.581
You just hang in there.

01:24:08.168 --> 01:24:09.830
<i>- You got the food, right?
- Yeah.</i>

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:12.453
Do we tell him?

01:24:12.673 --> 01:24:14.539
<i>Hey, this dog got a name?</i>

01:24:17.511 --> 01:24:20.629
See, Nicole, Chips... Nicole?

01:24:20.847 --> 01:24:21.883
What the hell's that?

01:24:22.266 --> 01:24:23.928
Oh, my God, it's Nicole!

01:24:28.397 --> 01:24:29.729
Shit.

01:24:38.031 --> 01:24:40.318
That idiot's going after
the fucking dog.

01:24:44.246 --> 01:24:46.033
She made it! She's in!

01:24:48.792 --> 01:24:51.000
<i>Guys, I found Chips!</i>

01:24:51.211 --> 01:24:52.793
<i>I got him. He's okay!</i>

01:24:53.005 --> 01:24:55.167
Nicole, how's Andy looking?

01:24:56.049 --> 01:24:58.587
<i>I don't know.
There's a lot of blood in here.</i>

01:24:58.802 --> 01:25:00.543
<i>It's everywhere!
There's blood everywhere!</i>

01:25:00.762 --> 01:25:02.754
Wait a minute, I see him.
He's on the roof.

01:25:04.224 --> 01:25:05.340
He's writing something.

01:25:05.976 --> 01:25:07.137
What's it say?

01:25:08.895 --> 01:25:10.011
<i>Guys?</i>

01:25:10.230 --> 01:25:11.437
Tell her to get out!

01:25:11.648 --> 01:25:13.310
<i>- Guys?
- What's wrong?</i>

01:25:13.525 --> 01:25:15.107
Nicole, baby, how's the truck?

01:25:15.485 --> 01:25:16.976
<i>I'm not going back
out there.</i>

01:25:17.195 --> 01:25:19.107
<i>Chips, be quiet!</i>

01:25:20.032 --> 01:25:21.773
Tell her to get
the hell out now!

01:25:21.992 --> 01:25:23.199
Honey, listen to me.
You need to find

01:25:23.410 --> 01:25:24.491
a place to hide.
Can you do that?

01:25:24.703 --> 01:25:26.615
<i>What do you mean?
What's going on?</i>

01:25:26.788 --> 01:25:28.700
<i>- Nicole?
- Here's Andy.</i>

01:25:28.915 --> 01:25:29.951
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

01:25:30.125 --> 01:25:31.206
No! Tell her to get out!

01:25:31.418 --> 01:25:32.750
Nicole, listen to me.

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:34.998
<i>I'm in a closet</i>

01:25:35.213 --> 01:25:37.421
<i>but he's outside,
he's trying to get...</i>

01:25:37.633 --> 01:25:39.590
Nicole? Nicole?

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:42.669
<i>Help me.
Please, you have to help me!</i>

01:25:42.888 --> 01:25:43.969
<i>I'm gonna die!</i>

01:25:49.019 --> 01:25:51.386
We need to do something. Now.

01:25:58.820 --> 01:26:00.436
Tucker, listen, when we
come back through here

01:26:00.656 --> 01:26:01.567
we may have company.

01:26:01.782 --> 01:26:02.693
You need to stay here

01:26:02.908 --> 01:26:04.365
and make sure
that fire door stays open.

01:26:04.576 --> 01:26:06.408
Wait, wait. I'm sorry. Uh...

01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:07.781
Why does he stay here

01:26:07.996 --> 01:26:09.077
while I go
on the suicide mission

01:26:09.289 --> 01:26:11.497
to rescue Terry's already
dead girlfriend?

01:26:11.708 --> 01:26:13.074
Fuck you, man.

01:26:13.293 --> 01:26:14.249
We don't know that.

01:26:14.461 --> 01:26:16.248
Either way,
we've gotta get over there

01:26:16.463 --> 01:26:18.420
and get the guns
to get out of this parking lot.

01:26:18.632 --> 01:26:19.918
Michael, it's okay.

01:26:20.425 --> 01:26:22.337
- Let him stay.
- Yeah.

01:26:22.719 --> 01:26:24.426
Steve, don't fuck this up.

01:26:24.638 --> 01:26:25.799
Yeah. Totally.

01:27:10.851 --> 01:27:12.012
All right.

01:27:12.644 --> 01:27:13.680
That's it.

01:27:13.895 --> 01:27:14.931
Are you sure?

01:27:15.522 --> 01:27:17.605
I ain't a plumber but I'd say
we're at the end of the line.

01:28:06.156 --> 01:28:07.237
Go! Go!

01:28:11.495 --> 01:28:12.451
Through here!

01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:14.404
Hurry up!

01:28:34.684 --> 01:28:35.765
Hurry up! Hurry!

01:28:52.077 --> 01:28:54.820
.357,.357. What do you need?

01:28:55.038 --> 01:28:57.280
.38,.38. Here.

01:28:57.499 --> 01:28:59.365
- Damn it.
- Hurry up.

01:29:05.757 --> 01:29:06.918
All right.

01:29:10.011 --> 01:29:11.127
Oh, shit.

01:29:16.184 --> 01:29:19.518
Nicole?

01:29:46.798 --> 01:29:49.882
Andy.

01:29:50.093 --> 01:29:52.631
I'm sorry, brother.

01:29:58.476 --> 01:29:59.592
Nicole, are you in there?

01:29:59.811 --> 01:30:00.927
I'm here! I'm here!

01:30:04.691 --> 01:30:06.353
Get as much ammo as you can.

01:30:09.613 --> 01:30:10.899
You got a plan?

01:30:11.239 --> 01:30:13.231
Uh-uh. You?

01:30:15.118 --> 01:30:16.484
How about a barbecue?

01:30:35.805 --> 01:30:37.546
How do we know if he hits it?

01:31:05.585 --> 01:31:07.998
CJ! Over here, hurry up!

01:31:09.047 --> 01:31:10.163
Over here!

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:13.294
Go! Get down! Look out!

01:31:17.639 --> 01:31:19.175
Come on, Tucker! Come on!

01:31:20.266 --> 01:31:22.303
Shit!

01:31:23.186 --> 01:31:25.473
- Ah, my leg!
- I got you, Tucker.

01:31:28.024 --> 01:31:29.265
Go! Go!

01:31:31.528 --> 01:31:32.609
Shit!

01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:36.856
Go!

01:31:38.868 --> 01:31:39.858
Go!

01:32:04.269 --> 01:32:07.353
Shoot me! Shoot me!

01:32:09.733 --> 01:32:12.521
Hurry! Come on!

01:32:13.153 --> 01:32:14.564
Hurry, hurry!

01:32:16.364 --> 01:32:18.321
Goddamn Steve Markus!

01:32:20.702 --> 01:32:23.069
- Steve, come on!
- Open up!

01:32:23.288 --> 01:32:25.746
Open the door!
Open the door!

01:32:25.957 --> 01:32:28.119
- Steve!
- I'll fucking kill him!

01:32:30.211 --> 01:32:31.247
Steve!

01:32:43.558 --> 01:32:44.639
Let's go!

01:32:52.317 --> 01:32:53.558
God damn it!

01:32:55.278 --> 01:32:56.439
Move!

01:33:03.495 --> 01:33:06.033
- Go!
- Move it, guys, move it!

01:33:06.748 --> 01:33:07.864
Where are you guys going?

01:33:08.083 --> 01:33:10.791
- Just go right now! We're going!
- Go! Go!

01:33:11.002 --> 01:33:12.618
They're right behind us! Go! Go!

01:33:12.837 --> 01:33:13.873
Go!

01:33:16.633 --> 01:33:18.465
Come on, move!
They're right behind us!

01:33:21.346 --> 01:33:22.336
Get in!

01:33:23.473 --> 01:33:24.589
Close the door!

01:33:36.569 --> 01:33:37.605
I like this song.

01:33:43.743 --> 01:33:44.984
Everybody in!

01:33:45.203 --> 01:33:46.114
Hey, there you are.

01:33:46.329 --> 01:33:47.820
What the hell
happened to you guys?

01:33:48.039 --> 01:33:48.825
Prick.

01:33:49.082 --> 01:33:50.414
I'll deal with you later,
motherfucker!

01:33:51.793 --> 01:33:53.250
Wait a minute! Nicole!

01:33:53.753 --> 01:33:54.743
Get in!

01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:58.671
I'll take the gun.

01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:00.086
Okay.

01:34:01.427 --> 01:34:02.668
Okay, let's get out of here!

01:34:22.407 --> 01:34:23.397
Hold on!

01:34:37.463 --> 01:34:38.920
Oh, Christ!

01:34:45.346 --> 01:34:46.553
CJ, now! Go!

01:35:04.324 --> 01:35:06.657
They're trying to turn us over!
Hit 'em with the saw!

01:35:33.436 --> 01:35:34.552
Give me a shotgun!

01:36:03.967 --> 01:36:05.083
Holy shit.

01:36:44.549 --> 01:36:46.290
There's still one hanging on.

01:36:47.385 --> 01:36:48.671
Which fucking side?

01:36:48.886 --> 01:36:50.047
Right side!

01:36:52.932 --> 01:36:54.343
I got him.

01:36:54.559 --> 01:36:57.302
You gotta drive faster, man.

01:36:57.478 --> 01:36:59.470
Hard left! Hard left here!

01:37:17.832 --> 01:37:19.744
Whoa, stop! Stop, guys!

01:37:20.418 --> 01:37:22.375
- What?
- We lost them.

01:37:22.879 --> 01:37:24.586
Back it up! Back it up! Back up!

01:37:30.219 --> 01:37:31.835
Kenneth, are you there? Kenneth?

01:37:36.976 --> 01:37:38.638
<i>Kenneth, are you there?</i>

01:37:46.277 --> 01:37:47.813
<i>Kenneth, are you okay?</i>

01:38:10.009 --> 01:38:11.090
What the fuck?

01:38:17.350 --> 01:38:18.386
What are you doing?

01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:21.017
Fucking nursery school.

01:38:25.566 --> 01:38:26.602
CJ!

01:38:32.281 --> 01:38:34.068
Ana, no! Everyone's dead.

01:38:34.242 --> 01:38:35.449
Steve took off.

01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:36.776
What?

01:38:38.538 --> 01:38:40.074
Let's go! Come on!

01:38:44.919 --> 01:38:45.875
Steve!

01:38:46.462 --> 01:38:48.624
I got him.

01:38:52.510 --> 01:38:53.466
Damn.

01:38:54.887 --> 01:38:56.628
Look out!

01:38:57.223 --> 01:38:58.714
Come on, come on!

01:39:01.269 --> 01:39:02.851
Go, go, go!

01:39:03.062 --> 01:39:04.678
Open the door!

01:39:05.440 --> 01:39:07.272
- Hurry up!
- Come on!

01:39:08.568 --> 01:39:09.604
Guys, get in!

01:39:17.326 --> 01:39:18.692
Let's go.

01:39:19.620 --> 01:39:21.577
Where's Ana? Ana!

01:39:24.125 --> 01:39:25.411
Ana!

01:39:27.336 --> 01:39:29.328
Get in! Get in!

01:39:41.392 --> 01:39:43.600
What the hell were you doing?

01:40:20.598 --> 01:40:21.588
Hold on!

01:40:52.922 --> 01:40:53.912
- Come on, boy.
- Go.

01:40:56.384 --> 01:40:58.171
Kenneth! Here.

01:40:58.511 --> 01:40:59.843
Get out on the end of the dock.

01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:03.047
- CJ, come on.
- Do it! I'll catch up!

01:41:06.561 --> 01:41:07.472
There it is!

01:41:07.687 --> 01:41:08.973
Terry, get the bowline!

01:41:10.773 --> 01:41:12.139
Shit.

01:41:16.195 --> 01:41:17.481
CJ!

01:41:20.366 --> 01:41:21.652
Damn! Fuck!

01:41:33.254 --> 01:41:34.244
Come on!

01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:37.547
Bitch! Shit.

01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:49.346
Come on.

01:41:54.609 --> 01:41:56.521
I'll blow every
fucking thing up.

01:42:27.642 --> 01:42:29.474
Okay, let's go, let's go.

01:42:29.977 --> 01:42:31.934
- I can't go.
- What?

01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:36.102
Downtown when they jumped
on us.

01:42:36.317 --> 01:42:38.525
Oh, no, Michael. No.

01:42:38.861 --> 01:42:39.977
I have to stay here.

01:42:40.196 --> 01:42:42.529
You can't. No, you...

01:42:42.865 --> 01:42:44.151
I'm sorry, Ana.

01:42:44.950 --> 01:42:46.816
- I can help you.
- No, you can't.

01:42:47.495 --> 01:42:48.736
You can help them.

01:42:50.122 --> 01:42:51.329
Stay on the boat.

01:42:56.962 --> 01:42:58.248
I can help you.

01:42:58.923 --> 01:42:59.959
It's okay.

01:43:00.508 --> 01:43:01.749
It's gonna be all right.

01:43:02.093 --> 01:43:03.049
No.

01:43:05.888 --> 01:43:07.004
It won't.

01:43:07.348 --> 01:43:08.338
Hey.

01:43:10.559 --> 01:43:11.640
It will.

01:43:26.701 --> 01:43:28.033
You sure you wanna do this?

01:43:29.078 --> 01:43:30.114
Yeah.

01:43:30.496 --> 01:43:32.237
I think I'll just stay here
a while.

01:43:32.873 --> 01:43:33.989
Enjoy the sunrise.

01:45:06.342 --> 01:45:08.129
I run a tight ship.

01:45:09.678 --> 01:45:11.886
- Where did you get that thing?
- I found Steve's camera.

01:45:47.633 --> 01:45:49.090
Put that down and help us.

01:45:54.181 --> 01:45:55.763
Kenneth, fucking shoot it!

01:46:08.487 --> 01:46:09.477
Christ!

01:46:19.748 --> 01:46:21.831
Oh, shit!

01:46:25.087 --> 01:46:27.079
<i>Get your damn camera
out my face.</i>

01:46:36.432 --> 01:46:38.014
<i>...like there's anyone there.</i>

01:46:40.477 --> 01:46:42.810
<i>Terry, put the camera down
and help us off the boat.</i>

01:46:51.238 --> 01:46:53.901
<i>Nicole, what is it?</i>

01:46:54.116 --> 01:46:55.323
<i>Chips, no!</i>

01:47:11.175 --> 01:47:12.666
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

01:47:14.803 --> 01:47:15.884
<i>Stay behind me!</i>
