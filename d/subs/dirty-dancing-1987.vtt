01:42.101 --> 01:43.897
<i>Hi, everybody.
This is your cousin Brucie.</i>

01:43.897 --> 01:46.551
<i>Whoa! Our summer romances
are in full bloom,</i>

01:46.551 --> 01:48.849
<i>and everybody,
but everybody's in love!</i>

01:48.884 --> 01:51.911
<i>So, cousins, here's a great song
from the Four Seasons.</i>

01:59.220 --> 02:02.023
<i>That was the summer
of 1963...</i>

02:02.056 --> 02:05.661
<i>when everybody called me "Baby"
and it didn't occur to me to mind.</i>

02:14.570 --> 02:16.706
<i>That was before
President Kennedy was shot,</i>

02:16.773 --> 02:18.741
<i>before the Beatles came,</i>

02:18.841 --> 02:20.911
<i>when I couldn't wait
to join the Peace Corps</i>

02:20.978 --> 02:24.882
<i>and I thought I'd never
find a guy as great as my dad.</i>

02:34.711 --> 02:36.928
<i>That was the summer
we went to Kellerman's.</i>

02:56.150 --> 02:59.153
<i>Ping-pong in the west arcade,
softball in the east diamond.</i>

02:59.253 --> 03:01.490
<i>All you Sandy Koufaxes,
get out there!</i>

03:01.590 --> 03:04.026
<i>Complimentary dance lessons
in the gazebo.</i>

03:04.093 --> 03:06.729
Oh, my God.
Look at that!

03:07.042 --> 03:09.495
Mom, I should've brought
those coral shoes.

03:09.495 --> 03:11.232
You said
I was taking too much.

03:11.232 --> 03:13.637
Well, sweetheart,
you brought ten pairs.

03:13.737 --> 03:16.206
But the coral shoes
matched that dress.

03:16.273 --> 03:17.941
This is not a tragedy.

03:18.008 --> 03:20.423
A tragedy is three men
trapped in a mine

03:20.423 --> 03:22.630
or police dogs
used in Birmingham.

03:22.665 --> 03:24.749
Monks burning themselves
in protest.

03:24.815 --> 03:26.217
Butt out, Baby.

03:26.365 --> 03:30.021
Okay, we got horseshoes
on the south lawn in 15 minutes!

03:30.121 --> 03:33.058
We got splish-splash,
the water class, down by the lake.

03:33.125 --> 03:36.763
We have the still life art class.
We got volleyball and croquet.

03:36.796 --> 03:39.365
And for you older folks,
we got sacks!

03:42.135 --> 03:42.135
Doc!

03:42.432 --> 03:43.833
It's doc!

03:44.204 --> 03:45.406
Max!

03:46.190 --> 03:50.244
Well, doc, after all these years
I finally got you up on my mountain.

03:51.145 --> 03:52.579
So, how's
the blood pressure, Max?

03:53.022 --> 03:54.582
I want you girls to know

03:54.649 --> 03:58.053
if it were not for this man,
I'd be standing here dead.

03:58.887 --> 04:01.323
- Billy, get the bags.
- Right away, doc, right away.

04:01.389 --> 04:04.593
I kept the best cabin
for you and your beautiful girls.

04:08.364 --> 04:12.312
He-hey, thanks a lot.
You want a job here?

04:12.368 --> 04:15.505
There's a merengue class in
the gazebo in the next few minutes.

04:15.572 --> 04:18.274
The greatest teacher.
Used to be a Rockette.

04:18.375 --> 04:22.347
It's his first real vacation
in six years, Max. Take it easy.

04:22.413 --> 04:25.284
Three weeks here,
it'll feel like a year.

04:25.384 --> 04:28.921
One, two, three, four! Stomp
those grapes and stomp some more!

04:29.021 --> 04:33.158
One, two, three, four!
Listen to the music!

04:33.225 --> 04:34.627
Sorry.

04:34.727 --> 04:36.463
Dry your caboose
and shake it loose!

04:36.563 --> 04:40.367
One, two, three, four!
Start the train!

04:44.871 --> 04:47.642
Now, come on, men!
Follow me into a round robin!

04:48.709 --> 04:50.945
Ladies,
the inner circle!

05:01.023 --> 05:02.591
Oh, come on, ladies!

05:02.658 --> 05:07.097
God wouldn't have given you maracas
if he didn't want you to shake 'em!

05:11.435 --> 05:14.204
Okay, now, ladies,
when I say "stop",

05:14.271 --> 05:17.274
you're gonna find
the man of your dreams.

05:18.343 --> 05:19.611
Stop!

05:21.313 --> 05:25.417
Now, remember, he's the boss
on the dance floor, if nowhere else.

05:34.293 --> 05:37.530
Mom, dad, I'm going up
to the main house to look around.

06:15.172 --> 06:17.875
There are two kinds
of help here.

06:17.975 --> 06:20.144
You waiters are
all college guys

06:20.211 --> 06:24.116
and I went to Harvard
and Yale to hire you.

06:24.182 --> 06:27.152
And why
did I do that? Why?

06:28.553 --> 06:31.357
I shouldn't have to remind you.
This is a family place.

06:31.424 --> 06:35.228
That means you keep your fingers out
of the water, your hair out of the soup

06:35.328 --> 06:37.498
and show the goddamn
daughters a good time.

06:38.332 --> 06:39.733
All the daughters.

06:41.235 --> 06:43.405
Even the dogs.

06:43.505 --> 06:46.241
Schlepp 'em out to the terrace,
show 'em the stars.

06:46.341 --> 06:48.610
- Romance 'em any way you want.
- Got that, guys?

06:48.710 --> 06:50.679
Hey, hold it!
Hold it.

06:52.581 --> 06:56.218
Well, if it isn't
the entertainment staff.

06:56.252 --> 06:58.587
Listen, wise ass,
you got your own rules.

06:58.688 --> 07:00.856
Dance with the daughters.
Teach 'em the mambo,

07:00.923 --> 07:03.560
the cha-cha,
anything they pay for.

07:03.627 --> 07:05.228
That's it.

07:05.329 --> 07:07.497
That's where it ends.

07:07.564 --> 07:11.234
No funny business, no conversations,
and keep you hands off!

07:14.138 --> 07:15.556
It's the same
in all these places.

07:15.556 --> 07:18.183
Some ass in the woods, baby,
but no conversation.

07:18.218 --> 07:19.811
Watch it, Rodriguez.

07:22.464 --> 07:24.494
Do you think you can
keep that straight, Johnny?

07:24.494 --> 07:26.805
That you can't lay
your hands on?

07:30.390 --> 07:33.085
Just put your pickle
on everybody's plate, college boy,

07:33.085 --> 07:35.054
and leave
the hard stuff to me.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.404
Sit down, sit down and
I'll get you some wine.

07:44.271 --> 07:45.807
Thank you, Max.

07:49.111 --> 07:50.846
This is dr. And Mrs. Houseman.

07:50.946 --> 07:54.984
Baby, Lisa, this is your waiter,
Robbie Gould.

07:55.084 --> 07:57.754
Yale medical school.

07:57.820 --> 07:59.879
Robbie, these people
are my special guests.

08:00.115 --> 08:01.936
Give them
anything they want.

08:01.971 --> 08:03.760
- Enjoy.
- Thanks, Max.

08:08.466 --> 08:12.671
Oh, look at all this leftover food. Are
there still starving children in Europe?

08:12.771 --> 08:15.473
- Try Southeast Asia, ma.
- Oh, right.

08:15.573 --> 08:18.144
Robbie, Baby wants to send
her leftover pot roast

08:18.210 --> 08:21.347
to Southeast Asia, so, uh, anything
you don't finish, you wrap up.

08:22.281 --> 08:24.884
Max, our Baby's gonna
change the world.

08:24.984 --> 08:28.322
- And what are you gonna do, Missy?
- Lisa's gonna decorate it.

08:28.422 --> 08:30.490
She already does.

08:32.491 --> 08:36.429
Doc, I want you to meet someone.
My grandson, Neil.

08:36.496 --> 08:38.900
Goes to the Cornell School
of Hotel Management.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.235
Oh, Baby's starting
Mount Holyoke in the fall.

08:42.236 --> 08:43.972
Oh, great.

08:52.649 --> 08:54.217
You going
to major in English?

08:54.847 --> 08:57.754
No. Economics of
underdeveloped countries.

08:57.821 --> 09:01.225
- I'm going into the Peace Corps.
- After the final show...

09:01.325 --> 09:05.096
I'm going to Mississippi with
a couple of busboys, freedom ride.

09:24.517 --> 09:27.086
This is
our own Tito Suarez.

10:14.340 --> 10:16.775
Mambo!
Yeah! Come on!

10:24.622 --> 10:26.161
Who's that?

10:26.187 --> 10:28.656
Oh, them.
They're the dance people.

10:28.888 --> 10:31.726
They're here to keep
the, uh, guests happy.

10:54.385 --> 10:56.344
They shouldn't be showin' off
with each other.

10:56.808 --> 10:59.164
That's not gonna sell lessons.

12:15.441 --> 12:17.534
- Hi, kids. Having fun?
- Yeah.

12:17.534 --> 12:21.949
Uh, actually, I've gotta excuse myself.
I'm in charge of the games tonight.

12:22.554 --> 12:24.752
Say, would you like to help me
get things started?

12:24.785 --> 12:26.487
Sure she would.

12:33.828 --> 12:37.932
This'll only hurt for a minute.
You've got Blue Cross, right?

12:47.310 --> 12:49.814
Was that good for you?

12:50.612 --> 12:53.484
And for being such a good sport,
here you go!

12:59.641 --> 13:01.960
You know, I finally met a girl
exactly like my mother.

13:02.061 --> 13:05.130
Dresses like 'er, acts like 'er.
So I brought 'er home.

13:05.164 --> 13:07.132
My father doesn't like 'er!

13:08.867 --> 13:10.704
Go figure.

13:59.691 --> 14:02.328
- Hi.
- How'd you get here?

14:02.361 --> 14:03.996
- I was taking a walk.
- Go back.

14:04.030 --> 14:05.226
- Let me help you.
- No.

14:05.226 --> 14:08.105
- What's up there?
- No guests allowed. House rules.

14:08.105 --> 14:09.723
Why don't you go back
to the playhouse?

14:10.117 --> 14:12.596
I saw you dancing
with the little boss man.

14:17.412 --> 14:19.380
Can you keep a secret?

14:21.683 --> 14:24.219
Your parents
would kill you.

14:24.319 --> 14:26.221
Max would kill me.

15:19.314 --> 15:21.650
Where'd they learn
to do that?

15:21.750 --> 15:22.866
Where?

15:23.651 --> 15:26.655
I don't know. Kids are doing it
in their basements back home.

15:27.957 --> 15:29.703
Wanna try it?

15:30.760 --> 15:32.663
Come on, Baby.

16:09.670 --> 16:12.807
Can you imagine dancing like this
on the main floor...

16:12.873 --> 16:15.361
home of the family fox-trot?

16:15.396 --> 16:17.878
Max would close
the place down first.

16:50.014 --> 16:52.284
That's my cousin,
Johnny Castle.

16:53.119 --> 16:55.421
He got me the job here.

17:14.443 --> 17:16.904
- They look great together.
- Yeah.

17:16.979 --> 17:19.448
You'd think they were
a couple, wouldn't you?

17:19.515 --> 17:23.286
- Aren't they?
- No, not since we were kids.

18:24.653 --> 18:27.524
Yo, cuz,
what's she doing here?

18:28.191 --> 18:30.861
She came with me.
She's with me.

18:30.927 --> 18:32.763
I carried a watermelon.

18:38.770 --> 18:40.839
"I carried a watermelon"?

19:14.576 --> 19:16.745
Bend your knees.
Down.

19:21.417 --> 19:22.985
Watch.
Watch my eyes.

19:23.986 --> 19:25.539
Good.

19:29.694 --> 19:31.227
That's better.

19:36.101 --> 19:38.069
Good.
Now roll this way.

19:39.939 --> 19:41.397
Now watch.

19:51.585 --> 19:52.875
Look.

20:04.065 --> 20:05.800
Love man!

20:41.474 --> 20:44.944
<i>Ladies, join our
hair-raising wig show.</i>

20:45.011 --> 20:46.979
<i>Try your Sandra Dee,
Jackie Kennedy</i>

20:47.080 --> 20:49.782
<i>or Elizabeth Taylor-Cleopatra
wig.</i>

20:49.816 --> 20:53.320
- I'll knock with three.
- Look at that. Look at that cute fella.

20:53.387 --> 20:55.656
Look at these hands.
They're golden hands.

20:58.359 --> 21:01.329
My God, it's Cleopatra!
I feel like such an "asp".

21:01.396 --> 21:03.666
You look
ten years younger.

21:03.733 --> 21:06.669
<i>At 10:15, by the pool,
we have calisthenics.</i>

21:06.702 --> 21:08.641
<i>Then on the west porch,
we have a symposium</i>

21:08.641 --> 21:12.717
<i>by Rabbi Maurice Sherman on
the psychology of insult comedians.</i>

21:14.745 --> 21:17.748
So, I say "Ask not what
your waiter can do for you

21:17.848 --> 21:20.317
but what you can do
for your waiter".

21:20.383 --> 21:23.354
If tips keep up, I'll have enough
for my Alfa Romeo.

21:24.756 --> 21:26.591
That's my favorite car.

21:28.760 --> 21:31.028
Ladies,
you look very lovely.

21:32.130 --> 21:33.480
Baby, would you
cover for me tonight?

21:33.821 --> 21:35.943
Tell mommy and daddy
I went to lie down.

21:36.034 --> 21:37.836
Uh, where you going?

21:37.903 --> 21:41.875
To the golf course. There's
a pretty view from the first tee.

21:45.079 --> 21:47.415
Good. Thanks.

21:54.522 --> 21:57.726
So... you were really
a Rockette?

21:57.793 --> 21:59.861
I think you're
a wonderful dancer.

22:00.217 --> 22:03.365
Yeah? Well, my mother
kicked me out when I was 16.

22:03.398 --> 22:07.070
I've been dancing ever since. It's the
only thing I ever wanted to do anyway.

22:08.438 --> 22:10.373
I envy you.

22:34.233 --> 22:38.271
- Aren't you dancing, doc?
- We're waiting for a waltz.

22:39.806 --> 22:43.844
Hi, Max. Aren't my dance lessons
starting to pay off?

22:43.910 --> 22:47.415
You look great, Vivian!
Terrific!

22:50.651 --> 22:54.589
That's Vivian Pressman,
one of the bungalow bunnies.

22:56.257 --> 22:59.228
That's what we call the women
who stay here all week long.

23:00.028 --> 23:02.965
The husbands only come up
on weekends.

23:03.031 --> 23:06.401
Moe Pressman's a big card player.
He'll join our game.

23:08.003 --> 23:10.807
- Moe coming up on Friday?
- Friday.

23:11.775 --> 23:14.145
He's away a lot.
I know.

23:15.446 --> 23:17.448
It's a hardship.

23:23.588 --> 23:26.272
Where's Penny?
Everybody's been asking for her.

23:28.627 --> 23:29.817
What do you mean,
where's Penny?

23:29.817 --> 23:32.044
She's taking a break.
She needs a break.

23:32.632 --> 23:35.168
As long as it's not
an all-night break.

23:39.305 --> 23:41.842
Come on, doll.
Let's take a walk.

23:51.252 --> 23:54.689
I love to watch your hair
blowing in the breeze.

23:58.260 --> 24:00.529
Maybe my parents
are looking for me.

24:00.629 --> 24:01.965
Baby, don't worry.

24:02.196 --> 24:03.538
If they think
you're with me,

24:03.538 --> 24:06.011
they'll be the happiest parents
at Kellerman's.

24:08.405 --> 24:10.340
I have to say it.

24:10.407 --> 24:13.411
- I'm known as the catch of the county.
- I'm sure you are.

24:13.478 --> 24:16.581
Last week I took a girl away
from Jamie, the lifeguard.

24:16.681 --> 24:18.249
And he said to her
right in front of me

24:18.570 --> 24:21.385
"What does he have
that I don't have?"

24:21.920 --> 24:25.224
And she said "Two hotels".

24:27.259 --> 24:28.393
Robbie.

24:29.294 --> 24:31.296
I don't hear
an apology.

24:31.396 --> 24:34.307
Go back to mommy and daddy
and keep listening, Lisa.

24:34.307 --> 24:36.499
Maybe you'll hear one
in your dreams.

24:38.772 --> 24:41.574
I'm sorry you had
to see that, Baby.

24:42.509 --> 24:44.946
Sometimes in this world...

24:45.046 --> 24:47.582
you see things
you don't wanna see.

24:52.154 --> 24:54.090
You hungry?

24:54.957 --> 24:56.349
Come on.

25:02.632 --> 25:05.947
So, Baby, what do you want?
You can have anything you want.

25:07.805 --> 25:10.407
Brownie, some milk...

25:10.474 --> 25:13.977
leftover rice pudding,
beets...

25:14.077 --> 25:15.780
cabbage roll...

25:19.984 --> 25:22.320
fruit salad,
sweet gherkins?

25:22.334 --> 25:26.459
Uh, Neil, look, I'm sorry.
I... better go check on Lisa.

25:26.559 --> 25:28.295
Yeah.

25:58.027 --> 26:01.030
- Why's she here?
- I brought her in case Neil comes back.

26:01.064 --> 26:02.919
Penny just doesn't think.

26:03.453 --> 26:05.940
She wouldn't do anything
stupid, would she?

26:07.037 --> 26:10.775
So, uh, what's wrong?
What's the matter with her?

26:11.809 --> 26:14.312
- She's knocked up, Baby.
- Billy!

26:16.014 --> 26:19.519
- What's he gonna do about it?
- "What's he gonna do about it?"

26:21.240 --> 26:22.321
Oh, it's mine, right?

26:22.909 --> 26:25.057
- Right away you think it's mine.
- But I thought...

26:42.710 --> 26:45.380
It's okay.
Okay, Johnny's here.

26:45.381 --> 26:47.483
Johnny's here.
It's okay.

26:48.122 --> 26:52.150
It's okay. I'm never gonna
let anything happen to you.

26:56.625 --> 26:58.536
We gotta go.

27:00.698 --> 27:03.067
Just hold on. Just hold on.

27:03.101 --> 27:05.703
Good girl. Good girl.

27:10.309 --> 27:13.312
What do you think you're doin'?
You're in trouble, you talk to me.

27:13.412 --> 27:15.848
I'll take care of everything.

27:15.914 --> 27:19.418
You should've come to me
in the first place.

27:19.485 --> 27:22.830
Forget it, Johnny. I'm not takin'
what's left of your salary.

27:22.922 --> 27:26.893
- Penny, that's my business.
- Besides, it wouldn't be enough.

27:36.737 --> 27:39.140
Oh, God, it's hopeless!

27:39.240 --> 27:41.409
Don't say that.

27:41.443 --> 27:44.447
There's gotta be a way
to work it out.

27:47.049 --> 27:50.419
Baby? Is that your name?

27:51.320 --> 27:53.090
You know what, Baby?

27:54.124 --> 27:56.593
You don't know shit
about my problems.

27:57.795 --> 27:59.703
I told 'er.

27:59.830 --> 28:01.938
Jesus, Billy!
Now she's gonna run

28:01.938 --> 28:03.518
and tell her little
management boyfriend

28:03.518 --> 28:05.046
and we'll all get fired.

28:05.370 --> 28:09.093
Why not skywrite it? "Penny got
knocked up by Robbie, the creep."

28:09.093 --> 28:09.972
Robbie?!

28:10.007 --> 28:11.739
- Look...
- No, no, Baby, Baby.

28:13.612 --> 28:16.449
One of the counselors
knows a doctor, a real M. D...

28:16.515 --> 28:19.518
just traveling through New Paltz
for one day next week.

28:19.618 --> 28:22.388
We can get an appointment,
but it costs 250 dollars.

28:22.455 --> 28:26.092
But if it's Robbie, there's no problem.
I know he has the money.

28:26.159 --> 28:29.329
- I'm sure if you tell 'im...
- He knows.

28:36.171 --> 28:40.435
Go back
to your playpen... Baby.

28:50.220 --> 28:52.692
Just where did you get up
telling me what's right?

28:52.692 --> 28:53.914
You can't just leave 'er.

28:53.949 --> 28:56.074
I didn't blow a summer
hauling toasted bagels

28:56.074 --> 28:57.579
just to bail out
some little chick

28:57.579 --> 28:59.764
who probably bowled
every guy in the place.

28:59.830 --> 29:02.022
A little precision,
please, Baby.

29:04.735 --> 29:07.839
Some people count,
some people don't.

29:09.708 --> 29:10.675
Read it.

29:13.011 --> 29:15.361
I think it's a book you'll enjoy,
but make sure you return it.

29:15.361 --> 29:16.945
I have notes in the margin.

29:18.752 --> 29:21.955
You make me sick.
Stay away from me.

29:22.055 --> 29:26.327
Stay away from my sister
or I'll have you fired.

29:40.643 --> 29:42.611
What am I doing wrong?

29:42.711 --> 29:45.166
You're lining it up
a little wrong, Marge.

29:47.284 --> 29:49.056
You know,
if your mother ever leaves me,

29:49.056 --> 29:50.375
it'll be for Arnold Palmer.

29:50.375 --> 29:52.889
- Daddy, someone's in trouble.
- Besides your mother?

29:53.376 --> 29:55.058
Now, you're overcorrecting,
Marge.

29:56.126 --> 29:59.234
And you always told me if someone
was in trouble, I should try to help.

29:59.631 --> 30:01.810
Could you lend me
250 dollars?

30:03.068 --> 30:05.304
You all right, Baby?
Are you in some kind o' trouble?

30:05.370 --> 30:08.374
No, no, it's not me.
Could you loan it to me?

30:08.408 --> 30:11.010
That's a lot of money, Baby.
What's it for?

30:11.563 --> 30:13.213
Baby,
stand up straight.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.149
I can't tell you.

30:16.249 --> 30:19.487
It's-it's hard for me to say
that to you, but I can't.

30:19.743 --> 30:22.097
You always said
you could tell me anything.

30:22.389 --> 30:24.758
I can't tell you this.

30:26.861 --> 30:29.264
It's not illegal, is it?

30:31.533 --> 30:32.995
No, daddy.

30:35.170 --> 30:39.007
That was a stupid thing to ask.
Forgive me.

30:40.543 --> 30:42.612
I'll have it for you
before dinner.

30:42.678 --> 30:45.282
- Is everything all right?
- Fine.

30:45.349 --> 30:47.284
Thanks.

31:47.084 --> 31:48.792
Here's the money.

31:50.754 --> 31:55.169
- You mean Robbie?
- No. You were right about him.

31:55.169 --> 31:58.246
- Then where'd you get it?
- You said you needed it.

31:59.598 --> 32:00.847
Is this kid for real?

32:01.416 --> 32:03.982
Yeah. Takes a real saint
to ask daddy.

32:08.608 --> 32:10.847
Thanks, baby,
but I can't use it.

32:15.365 --> 32:19.175
What? What's the matter with you?
You should take the money.

32:19.287 --> 32:22.747
I can only get her
an appointment for Thursday.

32:22.757 --> 32:25.060
They do their act at
the "Sheldrake" on Thursday night.

32:25.127 --> 32:27.703
If they cancel, they lose
this season's salary

32:27.703 --> 32:29.208
and next year's gig.

32:29.243 --> 32:30.599
What's the "Sheldrake"?

32:30.699 --> 32:33.849
It's another hotel
where they do their mambo act.

32:35.806 --> 32:38.192
Can't someone else
fill in?

32:38.942 --> 32:41.411
No, Miss Fix-It.
Somebody else can't fill in.

32:41.726 --> 32:44.581
Maria has to work all day.
She can't learn the routines.

32:44.648 --> 32:47.579
And Janet has to fill in for Penny.
Everybody works here.

32:48.553 --> 32:52.033
What, you wanna do it? Wanna...
take time out from "Simon Says"?

32:53.925 --> 32:55.827
It's not a bad idea.

32:57.034 --> 32:58.439
It was a joke, Billy.

32:59.331 --> 33:00.636
She can move.

33:00.636 --> 33:03.048
No, it's the dumbest idea
I ever heard of.

33:03.083 --> 33:05.305
- I can't even do the merengue.
- See?

33:05.371 --> 33:07.545
You're a strong partner.
You can lead anybody.

33:07.789 --> 33:08.667
But you heard 'er!

33:08.667 --> 33:12.005
She-she can't even do the merengue.
She can't do it. She cannot do it.

33:17.117 --> 33:19.387
- No!
- Oh, sorry. Sorry.

33:19.708 --> 33:21.667
You don't step
on the one.

33:22.057 --> 33:25.357
You gotta start on the two.
Find the two. You understand?

33:25.824 --> 33:27.835
Told you I never did
any of these dances before.

33:27.835 --> 33:30.684
Now, it's one, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

33:30.720 --> 33:33.041
Now, music starts,
you don't dance till the two.

33:33.041 --> 33:34.269
- Got it?
- Yes.

33:34.303 --> 33:36.180
Relax, relax.

33:36.372 --> 33:37.812
Breathe.

33:39.077 --> 33:40.181
Frame.

33:40.511 --> 33:41.200
Nope.

33:49.148 --> 33:50.156
Again.

33:50.567 --> 33:51.622
Ow.

33:53.185 --> 33:55.571
Two, three, four.
Two, three, four.

33:55.571 --> 33:58.067
Don't lean back.
Lifting up.

33:58.067 --> 34:01.312
Two, three, four.
Shoulders down. Two, three, four.

34:01.312 --> 34:06.170
Two, three, four. Two, three, four.
Two, three, four. Two, three, four.

34:07.274 --> 34:09.810
Again. Concentrate. And...

34:50.054 --> 34:52.121
Don't put your heel down.

34:53.431 --> 34:55.328
- Don't put your heel down.
- I didn't...

34:55.428 --> 34:58.295
Stay on the toe.
Just listen to me.

34:58.313 --> 35:02.282
The steps aren't enough.
Feel the music.

35:24.761 --> 35:24.794
It's not on the one.
It's not the mambo.

35:24.794 --> 35:26.937
It's not on the one.
It's not the mambo.

35:26.937 --> 35:30.016
It's a feeling.
A heartbeat.

35:38.012 --> 35:39.710
Don't try so hard.

35:44.115 --> 35:45.708
Close your eyes.

35:52.391 --> 35:55.339
Two, three, four.
Two, three, four.

35:55.339 --> 35:59.462
Two, three, four.
Two, three, four. Breathe.

36:12.547 --> 36:15.550
Head up. Lock your frame.
Lock it, lock, lock it.

36:15.650 --> 36:17.059
Look,
spaghetti arm.

36:18.211 --> 36:21.691
This is my dance space.
This is your dance space.

36:21.757 --> 36:25.162
I don't go into yours. You don't go
into mine. You gotta hold the frame.

36:25.328 --> 36:26.740
Again.

36:27.197 --> 36:28.325
Frame.

39:23.260 --> 39:23.360
Back. Easy.

39:23.360 --> 39:25.363
Back. Easy.

39:26.965 --> 39:30.735
And turn, turn. Down.
And lift. You'll learn that later.

39:30.768 --> 39:32.230
And... come on.

39:32.770 --> 39:34.739
Down. Twist.

39:34.772 --> 39:36.408
And... the bow.

39:36.508 --> 39:39.414
- Sorry. Sorry.
- You tryin' to kill me?

39:39.881 --> 39:43.782
You gotta concentrate!
Is that your idea of fun?

39:43.883 --> 39:45.929
Oh, ye... yes,
as a matter of fact it is.

39:45.929 --> 39:47.774
We're supposed to do
the show in two days,

39:47.774 --> 39:49.893
you won't show me lifts,
I'm not sure of turns...

39:49.893 --> 39:53.761
I'm doing all this to save your ass,
but I really wanna do is drop you on it!

39:55.763 --> 39:57.099
Let's get outta here.

40:03.805 --> 40:05.541
Shit!

40:07.777 --> 40:09.736
I locked the keys
in the car!

40:32.804 --> 40:34.498
You're gettin' wet,
right?

40:47.654 --> 40:49.657
- You're wild.
- What?

40:49.691 --> 40:51.893
You're wild!

41:19.991 --> 41:25.397
Now, the most important thing
to remember in lifts is balance.

41:26.331 --> 41:28.166
Whoa! Whoa!

41:34.274 --> 41:35.922
I got it now.

41:37.476 --> 41:38.912
So, where'd you learn
to be a dancer?

41:40.213 --> 41:43.744
Well, this guy came into
this luncheonette one day and...

41:44.084 --> 41:46.952
you know, we were all
sittin' around doing nothin'.

41:47.354 --> 41:50.925
And he said... that Arthur Murray
was giving a test for instructors.

41:51.025 --> 41:53.295
So... if you passed...

41:57.532 --> 41:59.287
they teach you all these
different kinds of dances,

41:59.287 --> 42:01.836
show you how to break 'em down,
how to teach 'em, you know...

42:06.449 --> 42:07.737
What?

42:10.372 --> 42:11.213
No.

42:16.796 --> 42:17.860
Good.

42:18.723 --> 42:22.927
Don't look. Hold it down.
Right here. Good.

42:23.319 --> 42:24.440
And...

43:07.344 --> 43:09.847
Now, bend your knees
and go up. Go, go.

43:11.815 --> 43:15.921
Good try. Now, you'll hurt me
if you don't trust me, all right?

43:15.987 --> 43:17.923
Now, go, go. Go.

43:20.152 --> 43:22.294
Good. Now, I'm gonna go up.
All right?

43:29.969 --> 43:33.239
You know, the best place
to practice lifts is in the water.

43:33.424 --> 43:36.035
Just bend your knees.
And... go.

43:36.744 --> 43:38.011
Good.

43:38.379 --> 43:39.981
Good. Good.

43:40.048 --> 43:42.150
Now hold the position.
Hold it.

43:42.217 --> 43:44.078
Good. Don't break!
Don't break!

43:57.767 --> 44:00.068
- Let's do it again.
- Okay.

44:02.505 --> 44:06.343
All right.
One... two... three.

44:07.611 --> 44:09.280
Oh, sorry.

44:10.615 --> 44:12.917
Good. Good...
No, no, no...

44:27.233 --> 44:28.621
It's not too bad.

44:32.806 --> 44:35.685
- One more time.
- Okay. Over my head. Go.

44:37.478 --> 44:39.644
I can't believe
it's tonight.

44:39.948 --> 44:43.118
The "Sheldrake"'s 20 minutes away.
We'll change in the car.

44:45.420 --> 44:48.026
Mrs. Schumacher.
Hey, Mrs. Schumacher, wait,

44:48.026 --> 44:49.501
we'll help you.

44:50.927 --> 44:53.629
Such junk. Such junk.

44:55.197 --> 45:00.136
Benny Bernstein's Dancing School
at the U.B., that's where I went.

45:00.236 --> 45:02.940
George Burns
was a teacher.

45:04.308 --> 45:06.304
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

45:11.483 --> 45:11.517
I'll just keep my shoulders down,
my head up...

45:11.517 --> 45:14.286
I'll just keep my shoulders down,
my head up...

45:14.353 --> 45:17.489
my... frame locked,
stay on my toes...

45:17.590 --> 45:19.218
What if I forget the steps?

45:19.218 --> 45:23.230
Pull up, watch your frame,
and remember, let him lead you.

45:23.296 --> 45:27.477
I'm afraid I'm gonna... forget to spike,
get dizzy and fall on my face.

45:27.921 --> 45:32.495
No. Don't look at my feet,
keep my head up, my eyes open...

45:32.673 --> 45:36.321
tension in my arms,
my frame locked, seat pulled up...

45:36.711 --> 45:38.707
Thanks, Baby.

45:41.182 --> 45:44.419
I just want you to know
that I don't sleep around...

45:44.486 --> 45:47.306
whatever Robbie
might have told you.

45:47.623 --> 45:50.116
And I thought
that he loved me.

45:51.261 --> 45:53.332
I thought
it was something special.

45:54.698 --> 45:57.028
Anyway, I just wanted you
to know that.

46:01.572 --> 46:03.116
So, how does it look?

46:11.650 --> 46:13.218
I'm scared.

46:15.688 --> 46:18.057
I'm so scared, Baby.

46:19.025 --> 46:23.185
Don't worry.
You'll be fine.

46:23.186 --> 46:25.133
You'll be fine.

46:28.669 --> 46:32.673
Bingo! Bingo! Bingo! That's right.
It's Thursday night at Kellerman's.

46:32.706 --> 46:34.030
That's bingo night.

46:34.030 --> 46:38.480
- Hey, how about a dance later?
- Could be. Who knows?

46:38.547 --> 46:40.549
Lisa, you just gotta do
something for me.

46:40.549 --> 46:42.108
I don't just
gotta do anything.

46:42.108 --> 46:43.761
Just tell mommy and daddy
I got a terrible headache

46:43.761 --> 46:45.944
and I'm in bed and
checking me once, okay?

46:48.892 --> 46:50.427
Bye.

46:52.556 --> 46:56.785
The "Sheldrake Hotel" is proud
to present Johnny Castle and partner

46:56.820 --> 46:58.936
in "Mambo Magic".

47:02.640 --> 47:04.004
Relax.

47:36.811 --> 47:38.765
Now spot a lead.

48:08.047 --> 48:09.983
Wrong way!

48:18.224 --> 48:19.757
Over here.

48:27.768 --> 48:29.537
Ready for the lift?

48:32.739 --> 48:33.937
Come on.

48:40.182 --> 48:41.666
Keep goin'.
Keep goin'.

49:25.300 --> 49:28.770
<i>...because wherever you are now,
I want you to look at the sky.</i>

49:28.870 --> 49:33.107
<i>Look at those stars. What a show.
Here are The Drifters.</i>

49:34.143 --> 49:35.612
You did good.
You worked hard.

49:35.612 --> 49:37.240
I saw that old couple
from Kellerman's

49:37.240 --> 49:40.511
- and I thought that was it.
- O-ho, me too. Me too.

49:42.452 --> 49:45.156
You know, but... by
the second turn, you really had it.

49:45.256 --> 49:48.793
- But I didn't do the lift.
- You did real good.

50:50.928 --> 50:52.497
Thanks.

50:55.767 --> 50:57.335
Johnny!

50:57.402 --> 50:59.566
Come on. It's Penny.

51:01.840 --> 51:03.127
She wouldn't be gone
till you got back.

51:03.127 --> 51:04.249
You didn't call
an ambulance?

51:04.249 --> 51:07.180
She said the hospital would call
the police. She made me promise.

51:07.380 --> 51:09.829
He didn't use
no ether, nothing.

51:10.184 --> 51:12.360
I thought you said
he was a real M.D.

51:12.360 --> 51:14.757
The guy had a dirty knife
and a folding table.

51:15.597 --> 51:17.658
I could hear her screaming
in the hallway.

51:17.758 --> 51:20.662
I swear to God,
I tried to get in.

51:22.798 --> 51:25.600
It's all right. Johnny's here.

51:39.215 --> 51:41.318
What? What is it, Baby?

51:42.519 --> 51:44.688
- Is it Lisa?
- No.

52:00.172 --> 52:03.710
Excuse me. Excuse me!
Everybody clear out, please.

52:14.322 --> 52:17.525
Yes, I know that hurts.
We're gonna take care of that.

52:21.095 --> 52:24.867
- Who's responsible for this girl?
- I am.

52:24.967 --> 52:27.303
Please, is she...

52:45.023 --> 52:46.992
Doc, thanks a lot.

52:47.025 --> 52:50.329
I don't know how to thank you.

53:00.340 --> 53:03.844
- Was that what my money paid for?
- I'm sorry. I never meant to lie.

53:03.911 --> 53:07.514
You're not the person I thought
you were. I'm not sure who you are.

53:07.581 --> 53:09.950
I don't want you to have anything
to do with those people.

53:10.050 --> 53:14.088
Nothing! You're to have nothing
to do with them ever again!

53:14.189 --> 53:17.759
I won't tell your mother about this.
Right now I'm going to bed.

53:17.859 --> 53:21.196
And take that stuff off your face
before your mother sees you!

53:25.435 --> 53:28.038
Is everything all right, Jake?

53:28.105 --> 53:31.541
It's all right, Marjorie.
Go back to sleep.

53:51.297 --> 53:53.232
Can I come in?

54:05.545 --> 54:09.384
I got a... I guess it's not a great room.
You probably got a great room.

54:09.451 --> 54:11.920
No. It's a great room!

54:22.932 --> 54:24.334
Leave it on.

54:26.769 --> 54:29.473
I'm sorry about the way
my father treated you.

54:31.275 --> 54:33.978
No. Your father was great.

54:34.044 --> 54:37.748
He was great.
The way he took care of Penny.

54:37.781 --> 54:40.885
I mean the way he was with you.

54:40.986 --> 54:43.455
It's really me it has to do with.

54:45.790 --> 54:48.794
Johnny, I came here
because my father...

54:48.861 --> 54:52.531
No. The way he saved her...
I could never do anything like that.

54:52.632 --> 54:56.603
That was something. People treat me
like I'm nothing because I am nothing.

54:57.437 --> 55:00.475
That's not true!
You're everything!

55:02.243 --> 55:05.446
You don't understand the way it is
for somebody like me.

55:05.513 --> 55:07.715
Last month I'm eating candy
to stay alive.

55:07.815 --> 55:10.786
This month, women are stuffing
diamonds in my pockets.

55:10.853 --> 55:13.088
I'm balancing on shit
and I can be down there again.

55:13.155 --> 55:16.792
No, it's not the way it is!
It doesn't have to be that way!

55:19.795 --> 55:22.799
I've never known anyone like you.
You think you can make the world better.

55:22.832 --> 55:24.934
Somebody's lost, you find them.
Somebody's bleeding...

55:25.001 --> 55:28.872
I go get my daddy.
That's really brave, like you said.

55:28.938 --> 55:31.809
That took a lot of guts
to go to him!

55:31.842 --> 55:33.944
You are not scared of anything.

55:34.011 --> 55:38.182
I'm scared of everything!
I'm scared of what I saw.

55:38.249 --> 55:41.888
I'm scared of what I did,
who I am.

55:41.954 --> 55:47.293
I'm scared of walking out of here and
never feeling for the rest of my life...

55:47.360 --> 55:49.595
the way I feel
when I'm with you!

56:11.319 --> 56:13.255
Dance with me.

56:15.391 --> 56:17.159
What, here?

56:17.226 --> 56:18.894
Here.

59:18.996 --> 59:22.233
Singers, dancers, actors,
this is your lucky day!

59:22.300 --> 59:25.704
Auditions for the annual Kellerman
end-of-the-season talent show...

59:25.804 --> 59:27.806
beginning in the playhouse.

59:34.647 --> 59:37.484
- Everyone gonna be in the show?
- We're leaving tomorrow.

59:37.517 --> 59:39.686
Miss the weekend traffic.

59:39.786 --> 59:41.654
But we're paid up 'til Sunday.

59:41.688 --> 59:44.692
- And miss the show?
- I said we're leaving tomorrow.

59:44.792 --> 59:47.795
- I was going to sing in the show.
- It's the big event.

59:47.828 --> 59:50.197
People bring their own arrangements.
You don't want to miss it.

59:50.297 --> 59:52.299
Baby, I need you for props.

59:53.835 --> 59:57.005
Why would you want to leave early?

01:00:03.980 --> 01:00:06.816
It was just an idea.
We can stay if you want to.

01:00:10.521 --> 01:00:14.124
- So, Lisa, what were you planning to sing?
- "I Feel Pretty."

01:00:14.192 --> 01:00:17.195
Or "What Do the Simple Folk Do?"

01:00:17.228 --> 01:00:21.032
Or "I Feel Pretty."
What do you think, daddy?

01:00:33.045 --> 01:00:34.480
You look much better.

01:00:37.184 --> 01:00:40.721
You just missed your father.
He's such a wonderful man.

01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:45.158
I'm sorry. I didn't realize...

01:00:45.225 --> 01:00:47.562
You couldn't have. It's okay.

01:00:59.576 --> 01:01:02.379
- So, how you doin'?
- I'm okay.

01:01:03.947 --> 01:01:06.416
Dr. Houseman says
I'm going to be fine.

01:01:07.752 --> 01:01:11.555
- I can still have children.
- Oh, Penny, that's really great.

01:01:14.125 --> 01:01:16.894
So, how did it go last night?

01:01:16.961 --> 01:01:18.930
Good.

01:01:20.232 --> 01:01:24.736
Fine. I didn't do the lifts,
but it was good.

01:01:35.448 --> 01:01:40.154
Well, I guess I gonna go.

01:01:42.323 --> 01:01:43.958
See ya.

01:01:52.034 --> 01:01:54.336
- So, he says you're going to be fine?
- What are you doing?

01:01:54.437 --> 01:01:57.873
- I'll tell Max your grandmother died.
- How many times have you told me...

01:01:57.973 --> 01:02:00.711
never get mixed-up with them?

01:02:00.811 --> 01:02:02.713
I know what I'm doing.

01:02:03.814 --> 01:02:07.584
You listen to me.
You've got to stop it now.

01:02:23.535 --> 01:02:26.740
Look, I gotta run.
I got a lesson with the Kramers.

01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:29.209
They'll kill each other
if I'm not there.

01:02:29.275 --> 01:02:31.712
Well, sure. You've gotta go.

01:02:34.515 --> 01:02:35.916
I'll see ya.

01:02:55.471 --> 01:02:58.374
It's rainy day game time.
Pin the tail on the guest.

01:02:58.474 --> 01:03:00.877
Win ten boxes of Kleenex
or a billy goat!

01:03:01.944 --> 01:03:05.416
God, I am so sick of this rain.

01:03:05.516 --> 01:03:08.218
Remind me not to take my honeymoon
at Niagara Falls.

01:03:08.285 --> 01:03:11.423
So, you go to Acapulco.
It'll be fine.

01:03:11.489 --> 01:03:15.127
Where is my beige
iridescent lipstick?

01:03:15.227 --> 01:03:17.396
I know I put it in this drawer.

01:03:17.496 --> 01:03:19.699
Baby, where are you going
in this weather?

01:03:19.765 --> 01:03:22.368
Uh, they're having charades
in the west lobby.

01:03:22.435 --> 01:03:25.372
Quite the little joiner,
aren't we?

01:03:40.154 --> 01:03:43.524
- Have you had many women?
- What?

01:03:46.295 --> 01:03:48.130
Baby, come on.

01:03:48.163 --> 01:03:50.132
Tell me. I want to know.

01:04:01.979 --> 01:04:04.115
You gotta understand
what it's like.

01:04:04.181 --> 01:04:06.618
You come from the streets
and suddenly you're up here.

01:04:06.718 --> 01:04:10.589
Women are throwing themselves
at you and they smell so good.

01:04:10.655 --> 01:04:12.758
They really take care
of themselves.

01:04:12.824 --> 01:04:15.260
I never knew women
could be like that.

01:04:15.327 --> 01:04:18.598
They're so goddamn rich you think
they must know about everything.

01:04:18.664 --> 01:04:21.367
They're slippin' their room keys
in my hand two and three times a day...

01:04:21.434 --> 01:04:25.638
different women...
so, I think I'm scorin' big, right?

01:04:25.738 --> 01:04:30.144
You think, "They wouldn't be doing this
if they didn't care about me, right?"

01:04:31.345 --> 01:04:34.314
That's all right. I understand.
You were just using them, that's all.

01:04:36.283 --> 01:04:37.752
No, that's not it.

01:04:38.653 --> 01:04:40.955
That's the thing.
It wasn't like that.

01:04:43.059 --> 01:04:45.161
They were using me.

01:05:12.725 --> 01:05:14.660
What's your real name, Baby?

01:05:16.662 --> 01:05:20.834
Frances, for the first woman
in the Cabinet.

01:05:23.036 --> 01:05:26.406
Frances.
That's a real grownup name.

01:05:39.588 --> 01:05:42.024
I've decided to go
all the way with Robbie.

01:05:44.594 --> 01:05:48.297
No, not with someone like him.

01:05:48.364 --> 01:05:52.736
Do you think if we came back for a
ten-year anniversary, it would be free?

01:05:52.836 --> 01:05:56.306
It's just wrong this way.
It should be with someone...

01:05:56.407 --> 01:06:01.012
With someone that
you sort of love.

01:06:01.046 --> 01:06:05.283
Come on.
You don't care about me.

01:06:05.383 --> 01:06:08.386
You wouldn't care if I humped
the entire army...

01:06:08.453 --> 01:06:11.624
as long as we were on the right side
of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

01:06:11.724 --> 01:06:16.563
What you care about is that
you're not Daddy's girl anymore.

01:06:16.596 --> 01:06:19.066
He listens when I talk now.

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.601
You hate that.

01:06:38.787 --> 01:06:41.523
Two, three, cha-cha-cha.

01:06:41.623 --> 01:06:44.494
My frame.
Where's my pleasing arc?

01:06:44.594 --> 01:06:48.131
Spaghetti arms! Would you
give me some tension, please?

01:06:49.999 --> 01:06:53.370
You're invading my dance space.
This is my dance space.

01:06:53.437 --> 01:06:55.840
That's yours. Let's cha-cha.

01:07:02.013 --> 01:07:04.684
Don't look down.
Look right here.

01:07:13.626 --> 01:07:18.365
- How you call your lover boy?
- Come here, lover boy.

01:07:18.465 --> 01:07:22.002
- And if he doesn't answer?
- Oh, lover boy.

01:07:22.102 --> 01:07:25.473
- And if still doesn't answer?
- I simply say...

01:07:25.507 --> 01:07:28.276
Baby

01:07:28.343 --> 01:07:31.179
O-Oh, baby

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:35.116
My sweet baby

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:38.120
You're the one

01:07:53.504 --> 01:07:55.006
Takin' dance lessons?

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:58.010
I could teach ya, kid.

01:08:02.714 --> 01:08:05.684
My grandfather put me in charge
of the final show.

01:08:05.751 --> 01:08:08.054
I want to talk to you
about the last dance.

01:08:08.154 --> 01:08:11.224
I'd like to shake things up a bit.

01:08:11.324 --> 01:08:13.927
You know, move with the times.

01:08:14.027 --> 01:08:16.029
I've got a lot of ideas.

01:08:16.095 --> 01:08:18.198
I've been working
with the staff kids...

01:08:18.232 --> 01:08:21.769
on a cross between a Cuban rhythm
and soul dancing.

01:08:21.868 --> 01:08:24.638
Whoa, boy.

01:08:24.738 --> 01:08:26.974
Way over your head here.

01:08:27.073 --> 01:08:31.046
You always do the mambo, huh?

01:08:31.113 --> 01:08:34.350
Why not dance this year's
final dance...

01:08:36.385 --> 01:08:38.255
to the pachenga?

01:08:39.423 --> 01:08:40.557
Right.

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:46.462
Well, you're free to do the same,
tired number as last year if you want...

01:08:46.563 --> 01:08:49.466
but next year we'll find
another dance person...

01:08:49.567 --> 01:08:51.935
- who'll only be too happy...
- Sure, Neil. No problem.

01:08:54.139 --> 01:08:56.307
We'll end the season
with the pachenga.

01:08:56.408 --> 01:08:57.841
Great idea.

01:09:04.417 --> 01:09:08.787
Sometimes he's hard to talk to,
but the ladies seem to like him.

01:09:08.821 --> 01:09:10.035
See that he gives you
the full half-hour

01:09:10.035 --> 01:09:11.707
you're paying him for, kid.

01:09:20.702 --> 01:09:23.772
That little wimp. He wouldn't know a
new idea if it hit him in the pachenga.

01:09:23.839 --> 01:09:26.055
He wants to know new ideas,
I could have told 'im some new ideas.

01:09:26.055 --> 01:09:27.546
Well, why did you let him
talk to you that way?

01:09:27.546 --> 01:09:28.907
What do you mean,
fight the boss man?

01:09:28.907 --> 01:09:30.330
Yeah, tell him your ideas.

01:09:30.548 --> 01:09:33.568
- He's a person like everyone else.
- Look, I know these people, Baby.

01:09:33.716 --> 01:09:36.045
They are rich and they're mean.
They won't listen to me.

01:09:36.045 --> 01:09:38.746
Well, then, why not fight harder?
Make 'em listen.

01:09:38.746 --> 01:09:41.268
Because I need this goddamn job
lined up for next summer.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.037
My dad calls me today.

01:09:44.037 --> 01:09:46.084
He says "Good news".
Then he says

01:09:46.084 --> 01:09:47.523
"Uncle Paul can finally
get you in the union."

01:09:47.523 --> 01:09:49.066
A wha... what union?

01:09:50.267 --> 01:09:54.171
The House Painters and Plasterers
Local Number 179 at your service.

01:10:02.137 --> 01:10:04.490
I've been thinking a lot
about the domino theory.

01:10:04.918 --> 01:10:07.287
Now, when Viet Nam falls,
is China next?

01:10:10.090 --> 01:10:11.864
I don't think they saw us.

01:10:23.205 --> 01:10:24.696
Fight harder, huh?

01:10:25.345 --> 01:10:27.101
I don't see you
fightin' so hard, Baby.

01:10:27.101 --> 01:10:29.482
I don't see you runnin' up
to daddy tell 'im that I'm your guy.

01:10:29.545 --> 01:10:31.714
I will. With my father,
it's complicated.

01:10:31.781 --> 01:10:34.217
- I will tell him.
- I don't believe you, Baby.

01:10:37.888 --> 01:10:39.356
I don't think...

01:10:40.891 --> 01:10:43.445
that you ever had
any intention of telling him.

01:10:44.442 --> 01:10:45.997
Ever.

01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:59.746
<i>Well, cousin, it's almost over.
Labor Day weekend is here.</i>

01:10:59.779 --> 01:11:01.692
<i>And soon it's back to
the old books and back to work.</i>

01:11:01.692 --> 01:11:03.508
<i>Oh, what a terrible thought!</i>

01:11:12.599 --> 01:11:15.229
Hi. Have you seen Johnny?

01:11:31.014 --> 01:11:32.316
I'm sorry.

01:11:36.788 --> 01:11:38.723
Hey, well, it looks like
I picked the wrong sister.

01:11:38.790 --> 01:11:41.600
That's okay, Baby.
I went slummin' too.

01:11:42.263 --> 01:11:43.430
Johnny!

01:11:58.853 --> 01:12:00.145
Hit me. Hit me.

01:12:08.189 --> 01:12:10.158
Get outta here.
You're not worth it.

01:12:10.901 --> 01:12:12.549
You're not worth it.

01:13:05.827 --> 01:13:09.998
- Hi, Vivian.
- Win big, Moe.

01:13:09.963 --> 01:13:11.894
As always.

01:13:29.446 --> 01:13:33.284
This is our last night together, lover.
I've got something worked out for us.

01:13:55.943 --> 01:13:58.245
Oh, excuse me, sir.
The pirate number's next.

01:13:58.312 --> 01:14:00.293
Oh, yeah. Thanks.
Hey, kid.

01:14:00.429 --> 01:14:03.115
You know I play cards all weekend
and I got an all-night game tonight.

01:14:03.115 --> 01:14:06.988
Why don't you, uh, give my wife
some extra dance lessons?

01:14:14.605 --> 01:14:17.501
Um... I'm sorry, Mr. Pressman,

01:14:17.501 --> 01:14:19.571
but... I'm booked up
the whole weekend here

01:14:19.571 --> 01:14:20.388
with the show
and everything,

01:14:20.388 --> 01:14:22.122
so I won't have time
for anything else.

01:14:22.589 --> 01:14:24.942
I don't think it'd be fair
to take the money.

01:14:50.561 --> 01:14:53.225
I've decided tonight's
the night with Robbie.

01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:55.472
He doesn't even know yet.

01:14:57.343 --> 01:14:59.072
Oh, hey, Lisa!

01:15:29.726 --> 01:15:32.629
Robbie. It's me.

01:15:38.089 --> 01:15:39.425
Holy shit!

01:16:00.183 --> 01:16:02.275
Wanna hear somethin' crazy?

01:16:06.568 --> 01:16:08.390
Last night I...

01:16:09.031 --> 01:16:13.364
I dreamt we were walkin' along
and... we met your father

01:16:13.364 --> 01:16:16.021
and he said "Come on",
and he put his arm around me.

01:16:17.857 --> 01:16:19.957
Just like he did
with Robbie.

01:17:07.657 --> 01:17:10.720
You know how you feel
when you see a patient and...

01:17:11.364 --> 01:17:13.827
now you think he's all right,
then you look at the X rays

01:17:13.827 --> 01:17:16.801
- and it's nothing like you thought?
- What happened, Max?

01:17:16.801 --> 01:17:20.804
It's exactly what it's like when you
find out one of your staff's a thief.

01:17:20.838 --> 01:17:22.359
Moe Pressman's wallet
was stolen

01:17:22.359 --> 01:17:24.496
when he was playing
pinochle last night.

01:17:24.609 --> 01:17:27.176
It was in his jacket hanging
on the back of his chair.

01:17:27.176 --> 01:17:31.316
He had it at 1:30 and when he
checked again at quarter of 4:00...

01:17:31.438 --> 01:17:33.438
it was missing.

01:17:34.488 --> 01:17:39.965
Vivian thinks she remembers
this dance kid... Johnny, walking by.

01:17:40.907 --> 01:17:44.482
So we ask 'im
"You have an alibi for last night?"

01:17:44.912 --> 01:17:47.906
He says he was alone
in his room, reading.

01:17:48.447 --> 01:17:51.417
There are no books
in Johnny's room, hm...

01:17:52.618 --> 01:17:55.102
Look, there's been a mistake.
I know Johnny didn't do it.

01:17:55.102 --> 01:17:56.621
There've been similar thefts
at the "Sheldrake"

01:17:56.621 --> 01:17:57.654
and it's happened here before.

01:17:57.654 --> 01:17:59.972
- Three other wallets.
- I know he didn't do it.

01:17:59.972 --> 01:18:01.715
Stay out of it, Baby.

01:18:02.319 --> 01:18:06.218
Wait. Don't put
those tables together. Come on.

01:18:08.286 --> 01:18:09.595
Daddy,
I need your help.

01:18:09.929 --> 01:18:12.356
I know Johnny didn't take
Moe's wallet. I know.

01:18:12.356 --> 01:18:15.231
- Oh? How do you know?
- I can't tell you.

01:18:15.331 --> 01:18:19.889
- But just please trust me, daddy.
- I'm sorry, Baby. I can't.

01:18:20.205 --> 01:18:21.796
This Danish is pure protein.

01:18:21.796 --> 01:18:26.824
Oh, Mr. Kelleman, look.
Uh... maybe Johnny didn't do it.

01:18:26.824 --> 01:18:28.568
Anyone could've taken it.

01:18:28.568 --> 01:18:29.893
Maybe it was, uh...

01:18:29.893 --> 01:18:33.280
I-i... you... it could've been that-that
little, old couple, the Schumachers.

01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:36.803
- I saw her with a couple of wallets.
- Sylvia and Sidney?

01:18:36.803 --> 01:18:39.909
Baby, you don't go around
accusing innocent people.

01:18:39.909 --> 01:18:42.129
Yeah, but I even saw, I even
saw them at the "Sheldrake".

01:18:42.129 --> 01:18:44.315
Didn't you say something
was stolen from the "Sheldrake"?

01:18:44.358 --> 01:18:47.568
I got an eyewitness
and the kid has no alibi.

01:18:47.941 --> 01:18:52.170
Come on, Neil. You'll learn
what it's like to fire an employee.

01:18:52.170 --> 01:18:53.818
Oh, Mr-Mr. Kellerman.
Wait a minute.

01:18:53.818 --> 01:18:56.658
I know
Johnny didn't take the wallet.

01:18:56.719 --> 01:19:00.106
I know he didn't take it because
he was in his room all night.

01:19:00.483 --> 01:19:04.988
And the reason I know
is because I was with him.

01:19:29.415 --> 01:19:31.445
I told you
I was telling the truth, daddy.

01:19:35.802 --> 01:19:38.158
I'm sorry I lied to you.

01:19:40.761 --> 01:19:42.490
But you lied too.

01:19:44.806 --> 01:19:48.208
You told me everyone was alike
and deserved a fair break.

01:19:48.837 --> 01:19:50.940
But you meant
everyone who is like you.

01:19:53.146 --> 01:19:56.908
You told me you wanted me
to change the world, to make it better.

01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:00.328
But you meant by becoming
a lawyer or an economist

01:20:00.328 --> 01:20:02.649
and marrying someone
from Harvard.

01:20:05.076 --> 01:20:07.140
I'm not proud
of myself.

01:20:07.531 --> 01:20:08.971
But I'm
in this family too

01:20:08.971 --> 01:20:11.891
and you can't keep giving me
the silent treatment.

01:20:14.661 --> 01:20:17.760
There are a lot of things about me
that aren't what you thought.

01:20:18.507 --> 01:20:21.971
But if you love me, you have to love
all the things about me.

01:20:24.118 --> 01:20:26.206
And I love you.

01:20:26.388 --> 01:20:31.154
I'm sorry I let you down.
I'm so sorry, daddy.

01:20:31.597 --> 01:20:34.422
But you let me down too.

01:21:04.249 --> 01:21:06.577
I have been lookin'
for you all over.

01:21:07.301 --> 01:21:09.256
They found
the Schumachers.

01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:11.745
They fingerprinted
their water glasses...

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.336
They found out they were wanted
in Arizona and Florida

01:21:14.336 --> 01:21:16.640
and they made a fortune
here this summer.

01:21:17.012 --> 01:21:19.673
So, so then it's all right.

01:21:20.149 --> 01:21:22.143
I knew
it would work out.

01:21:22.239 --> 01:21:25.112
- I knew they'd have to apologize.
- I'm out, Baby.

01:21:30.350 --> 01:21:32.294
They fired you anyway
because o' me.

01:21:33.392 --> 01:21:37.266
And if I leave quietly,
I'll get my summer bonus.

01:21:39.659 --> 01:21:41.708
So I did it for nothing.

01:21:41.948 --> 01:21:46.110
I hurt my family, you lost your job
anyway... I did it for nothing!

01:21:46.110 --> 01:21:48.304
No, no,
not for nothing, Baby.

01:21:48.370 --> 01:21:51.534
Nobody has ever done anything
like that for me before.

01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:53.288
You were right, Johnny.

01:21:53.288 --> 01:21:55.392
You can't win
no matter what you do.

01:21:55.392 --> 01:21:59.090
You listen to me. I don't wanna
hear that from you. You can.

01:22:00.702 --> 01:22:02.670
I used to think so.

01:22:23.983 --> 01:22:25.714
Dr. Houseman,
can I, uh...

01:22:27.895 --> 01:22:31.113
Look, I'm goin' anyway and
I know what you must be thinkin'.

01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:34.376
You don't know anything
about me. Anything at all.

01:22:34.655 --> 01:22:37.000
I know you want Baby
to be like you.

01:22:37.036 --> 01:22:39.603
The kind of person that does things
make other people look up to.

01:22:39.806 --> 01:22:42.240
Dr. Houseman, Baby is like that.
I mean, if you could just see I...

01:22:42.240 --> 01:22:44.320
Don't you
tell me what to see.

01:22:45.087 --> 01:22:48.061
I see someone in front of me
who got his partner in trouble

01:22:48.061 --> 01:22:50.053
and sent her off
to some... butcher,

01:22:50.161 --> 01:22:54.012
while he moved on to an innocent,
young girl like my daughter.

01:22:58.574 --> 01:23:01.336
Yeah, I guess that's
what you would see.

01:23:16.919 --> 01:23:20.122
I can't imagine being here
without you even one day.

01:23:20.233 --> 01:23:24.052
Oh, just think, you have more time
for... horseshoes and croquet.

01:23:26.809 --> 01:23:29.864
Maybe they'll... saw you
in seven pieces now.

01:23:31.796 --> 01:23:33.854
I guess
we surprised everybody.

01:23:36.386 --> 01:23:38.349
I guess we did.

01:23:46.352 --> 01:23:51.998
- I'll never be sorry.
- Neither will I.

01:23:59.008 --> 01:24:00.586
I'll see ya.

01:24:53.455 --> 01:24:58.646
Baby...
I'll do your hair.

01:25:00.811 --> 01:25:03.132
It could look pretty if...

01:25:06.341 --> 01:25:12.782
No. You're prettier
your way. This way.

01:25:35.448 --> 01:25:39.709
Kellermans,
we come together

01:25:39.709 --> 01:25:43.477
Singing all as one

01:25:43.477 --> 01:25:48.030
We have shared
another season's

01:25:48.030 --> 01:25:51.825
Talent, play and fun

01:25:51.825 --> 01:25:56.135
Summer days
will soon be over

01:25:56.135 --> 01:25:59.957
Soon the autumn starts

01:25:59.957 --> 01:26:04.407
And tonight
the memories whisper

01:26:04.407 --> 01:26:07.991
Softly in our hearts

01:26:08.922 --> 01:26:12.827
Join hands and
hearts and voices

01:26:12.827 --> 01:26:16.096
Voices, hearts
and hands

01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:20.483
At Kellerman's
the friendships last

01:26:20.483 --> 01:26:24.703
Long as the mountains stand

01:26:24.907 --> 01:26:29.061
Daytime, nighttime,
any hour

01:26:29.061 --> 01:26:33.068
Weather rain or shine

01:26:33.068 --> 01:26:37.243
Games and lectures
Jokes and music

01:26:37.243 --> 01:26:41.414
Happily combine

01:26:51.092 --> 01:26:52.350
Robbie!

01:26:55.413 --> 01:26:57.244
Good luck
in medical school, son.

01:26:58.849 --> 01:27:02.042
And I wanted to thank you for
your help with the Penny situation.

01:27:02.121 --> 01:27:04.662
Guess we've all gotten
into messes like this.

01:27:04.850 --> 01:27:06.219
What?

01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:09.795
I thought Baby told you.
Look, I'm not sure.

01:27:10.015 --> 01:27:12.493
I mean, Penny said so,
but you know with girls like that.

01:27:12.493 --> 01:27:14.551
They're liable to pin it
on any guy around.

01:27:22.011 --> 01:27:24.047
- What's the hot tip for the day?
- Finished.

01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:27.578
You and me, Tito.
We've seen it all, eh?

01:27:27.912 --> 01:27:32.415
Bubbah and Zeda serving the first
pasteurized milk to the boarders...

01:27:33.194 --> 01:27:35.611
Through the war years
when we didn't have any meat.

01:27:35.611 --> 01:27:38.021
Through the Depression
when we didn't have anything.

01:27:38.166 --> 01:27:40.826
Lots o' changes, though, Max.
Lots o' changes.

01:27:40.826 --> 01:27:43.872
It's not the changes
so much this time, Tito. It's...

01:27:44.267 --> 01:27:46.933
It's that it all seems
to be ending.

01:27:46.991 --> 01:27:50.937
You think kids wanna come with their
parents and take foxtrot lessons?

01:27:50.937 --> 01:27:54.240
Trips to Europe,
that's what the kids want.

01:27:55.153 --> 01:27:58.187
Twenty-two countries
in three days.

01:27:58.872 --> 01:28:01.578
Feels like
it's all slipping away.

01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:06.305
But the heartbeats
of vacation

01:28:06.305 --> 01:28:09.941
There no cares are seen

01:28:10.176 --> 01:28:14.380
So let's join in
just one last chorus

01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:17.797
Visitors, staff and guests

01:28:18.302 --> 01:28:22.351
What we've shared
won't be forgotten

01:28:22.351 --> 01:28:25.900
Old friends are the best...

01:29:01.334 --> 01:29:03.559
Nobody puts Baby
in the corner.

01:29:04.709 --> 01:29:05.977
Come on.

01:29:26.604 --> 01:29:28.430
Sorry about
the disruption, folks,

01:29:29.291 --> 01:29:32.083
but I always do
the last dance o' the season.

01:29:32.262 --> 01:29:34.608
This year
somebody told me not to.

01:29:35.268 --> 01:29:38.758
So I'm gonna do my kind o' dancin'
with a great partner...

01:29:39.931 --> 01:29:41.738
who's not only
a terrific dancer...

01:29:42.835 --> 01:29:45.618
but somebody who's taught me
that there are people

01:29:45.618 --> 01:29:49.222
willin' to stand up for other people
no matter what it cost them.

01:29:49.843 --> 01:29:53.112
Somebody... who's taught me...

01:29:54.355 --> 01:29:56.859
