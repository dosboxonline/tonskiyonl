[Young Vic] Hey, uh, Dad.
Can I get a superhero toy?

-[Silas] Yes, Vic.
-Dad.

01:50.143 --> 01:51.911
[Silas] I'll hop in line

Take your hands off of my son.

02:28.348 --> 02:29.449

Now is not the time to be

02:45.632 --> 02:48.401
I was just looking for some
black superhero toys.

02:50.303 --> 02:52.405
We don't carry
Black superhero toys.

02:52.505 --> 02:53.840
Why not?

02:53.907 --> 02:56.309
No one buys
Black superhero toys.

02:56.376 --> 02:58.711
Look, I guarantee you,
he meant no harm.

02:59.679 --> 03:01.514

I just wanted
a Black superhero toy.

Secondly, I've taken
a recent foray into the past,

10:19.452 --> 10:22.688
and since my return,
I've worked
with the Sisterhood of Dada

Everyone in the world

11:35.494 --> 11:37.096
unless they have
a breakthrough.

11:37.196 --> 11:39.999
Wait. So, the plan is
we just stew in our own shit

Because that's pretty evil.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.259

12:07.359 --> 12:10.563

believe it.

So, the ape filled you in?
The big picture?

12:38.958 --> 12:42.328
Oh, well, the brotherhood
of Evil is searching

12:42.428 --> 12:44.964
for a human guinea pig

12:46.766 --> 12:49.902
to travel to the year 2021

12:49.969 --> 12:52.338
that you reverse engineers,

12:52.438 --> 12:55.307
from a drawing that you drew
30 years ago.

12:55.407 --> 12:57.610

inventions

12:57.676 --> 13:00.346
and bring them back here
to 1949.

13:00.446 --> 13:04.450
So, you would invent them
before he does.

13:04.517 --> 13:08.821
Steal his dreams
and rule the world.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.258

13:12.324 --> 13:14.293
-Very evil...
-Right?

13:14.360 --> 13:17.263
And she shifts shapes.

13:17.329 --> 13:18.697
Did you tell her
the other thing?

13:18.798 --> 13:20.533
I would never do that to you.

13:21.200 --> 13:22.368

How attached are you?

Um, I don't know, what do you
have in mind?

So sorry.

Madame Rouge.

13:39.819 --> 13:42.354
Well, what do you say?

13:42.454 --> 13:47.893
I say that you had me
at fuck, Niles Colder.

13:47.993 --> 13:49.628
I think this is crazy.

13:51.130 --> 13:55.701
I don't have to do this.
It's a memory.

for your son.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.589

14:18.023 --> 14:19.425
I'm not him.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.261
-He's not here.
-Let your sins
live in the past.

You have to make
a break from all those

immoral things
that you've done.

14:30.669 --> 14:33.906
Show the Lord
that you could be
a faithful husband.

14:34.006 --> 14:37.443
Show him that you could be
devoted to a woman.

14:39.511 --> 14:41.180
Put the Lord first, Larry.

14:41.914 --> 14:43.749
It isn't the past.

14:48.254 --> 14:50.723
I'm gay, Mother.

14:50.789 --> 14:53.893
-It's who I am.
-I have prayed
over this, Larry.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.794
I have prayed for you
to change.

14:55.895 --> 14:58.364
And to be the man
that Sheryl needs you to be.

14:58.430 --> 15:00.733
Can you love me for who I am?

15:01.734 --> 15:03.569
Why is that so hard?

15:03.636 --> 15:05.237
In my heart,

15:05.304 --> 15:09.708
I know that you don't want to
bring shame to my life

15:09.775 --> 15:11.310
and your father's life.

15:11.410 --> 15:14.813
We are God fearing members
of this community.

15:14.914 --> 15:17.216
But you suffocated
your own son.

15:28.994 --> 15:29.962
For Sheryl.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.631
My gift to you both.

15:34.633 --> 15:36.902
You can have a good life, son.

15:39.004 --> 15:41.507
Carry on our tradition

15:41.607 --> 15:45.678
of righteousness
and true salvation.

15:49.281 --> 15:51.784
I've always been
invisible to you.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.423
See me.

15:58.524 --> 16:00.292
Listen to me.

16:00.359 --> 16:02.828
This is not
who I was born to be.

16:04.930 --> 16:06.198
Can't you hear me?

16:12.438 --> 16:17.776
[sobbing]

16:17.843 --> 16:19.845
I've looked everywhere.

16:19.945 --> 16:21.380
She's gone. [sobbing]

16:21.480 --> 16:22.681
[gasps]

16:22.781 --> 16:24.216
-[puppet 1] Oh, no.
-[Jane] Relax, everyone.

16:24.316 --> 16:26.952
-This feels like
it's really happening.
-Oh, no.

16:27.019 --> 16:28.187
Kay is gone.

16:28.287 --> 16:29.555
What if she got better?

16:29.655 --> 16:31.523
Oh, she wouldn't do that,
would she?

16:32.157 --> 16:33.225
Could she?

16:33.325 --> 16:35.294
What's going to happen
to us? [sobbing]

16:35.361 --> 16:38.063
-Oh.
-Everyone, calm down.

16:38.163 --> 16:40.699
-[mumbling]
-Okay. How about something
more positive?

16:40.799 --> 16:42.534
What was the lesson of the day?

16:43.135 --> 16:44.470
Drama?

16:44.536 --> 16:46.705
Ah, well,

16:46.805 --> 16:50.175
how about we talk about
something
a little more uplifting?

16:50.242 --> 16:51.510
-Oh.
-Um...

16:51.577 --> 16:54.513
-[gasps]
-[sobbing]

16:55.748 --> 16:58.217
-Oh.
-See, it's going to be okay.

16:58.317 --> 16:59.418
I fixed it.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.321
I can fix this.

17:02.388 --> 17:05.090
Jane, you can't fix this.

17:05.190 --> 17:07.426
-None of you can.
-Shut up, Harry.

17:07.526 --> 17:08.427
What the fuck do you know?

17:08.527 --> 17:09.428
Who told you that?

17:09.528 --> 17:10.829
Did Kay tell you that?

17:10.896 --> 17:13.766
Duh, all of you think
you know Kay,

17:13.866 --> 17:15.034
but I'm the only one

17:15.100 --> 17:16.935
she tells her
real feelings to.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.872
-I said, shut the fuck
up. [whacks]
-Ow!

17:19.938 --> 17:21.607
[all gasping]

17:21.707 --> 17:23.842
-[groans]
-Oh, my God.

17:23.909 --> 17:24.877
I'm so sorry.

17:24.943 --> 17:26.945
-[puppet groans]
-[Jane] No.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.447
-[puppet 1] Here.
-[puppet 2 sighs]

17:28.547 --> 17:33.685
This is the lesson
of the day that we needed.

17:33.752 --> 17:36.855
I know. I'm not going to listen
to a fucking stuffed animal.

17:36.922 --> 17:39.558
Tell me what Kay wants
or doesn't want.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.727
-Oh, no, no, no.
-[Jane] Yeah, yeah.

17:41.794 --> 17:45.297
-Oh.
-[all grunting and screaming]

17:56.809 --> 18:02.548
[all laughing maliciously]

18:05.818 --> 18:09.388
[toys clanking]

18:18.730 --> 18:19.998
Dad was right.

18:20.099 --> 18:23.469
Have to be strong like you,
General Tony.

18:23.569 --> 18:25.170
You were scared.

18:25.270 --> 18:27.573
No one gave you permission
to be scared.

18:27.639 --> 18:29.174
It's time for me to grow up.

18:29.274 --> 18:32.277
Be a brave,
disciplined warrior.

18:32.344 --> 18:34.113
You're a child.

18:34.179 --> 18:35.981
It's okay to be a child.

18:37.149 --> 18:39.351
Dad said, "No more mistakes."

18:39.451 --> 18:40.853
I have my orders.

18:41.787 --> 18:43.255
Please hear me.

18:44.923 --> 18:46.592
I need you to hear me.

18:47.993 --> 18:53.866
So Madame Rouge was canned
by the Bureau of Normalcy,

18:53.966 --> 18:56.535
because of what she did
to the Sisterhood of Dada.

18:56.635 --> 19:00.973
So, then she joined
the Brotherhood of Evil.

19:02.207 --> 19:03.942
That sounds like
a bad comic book.

19:04.009 --> 19:08.680
She came here
to the future to destroy
Niles Calder's legacy,

19:08.780 --> 19:10.215
which is us.

19:10.315 --> 19:13.218
We have to stop her
in order to protect ourselves.

19:13.318 --> 19:14.820
Wait, I thought she killed
your lover boy.

19:14.887 --> 19:17.456
-And you want revenge?
-Yeah, that too.

19:17.523 --> 19:19.958
Just wait a minute.

19:20.826 --> 19:22.995
This is not what we do.

19:23.662 --> 19:25.063
I'm a Sub.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.833
I don't clean up messes,
I create messes.

19:27.900 --> 19:30.302
Looks like the lesson
of the day is,

19:30.369 --> 19:31.837
you're on your own.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.338
[chuckles]

19:33.405 --> 19:36.542
For the record,
your conscious selves
are lazy,

19:36.642 --> 19:38.877
self-pitying and cruel.

19:38.977 --> 19:40.879
But at least they had spunk.

19:40.979 --> 19:43.415
They always protected
the little guy.

19:47.853 --> 19:49.588
All right then.

19:49.688 --> 19:55.260
We can sit here and go through
the Eternal Flagellation.

19:55.360 --> 19:57.563
Basically put your shit
on display

19:57.663 --> 19:59.431
for everyone in this room.

19:59.531 --> 20:00.866
Mm?

20:00.933 --> 20:02.234
Who is first?

20:12.511 --> 20:15.180
Go! Go!

20:15.247 --> 20:17.082
Go! Go! Go!

20:20.686 --> 20:22.621
Are you sure about this?

20:22.721 --> 20:24.790
You have no idea.

20:44.743 --> 20:45.978
Going on a trip?

20:47.913 --> 20:48.747
What?

20:52.451 --> 20:53.652
Oh.

20:53.752 --> 20:57.723
Yes, to the future.

20:57.789 --> 21:01.493
Apparently I'll be borrowing
your time traveling machine

21:01.593 --> 21:04.263
or some facsimile of.

21:04.329 --> 21:07.966
Don't you dare equate
your mission with mine.

21:08.066 --> 21:10.135
Oh, no, no, no, not at all.

21:10.235 --> 21:12.671
Well, for starters, my mission

21:12.771 --> 21:16.174
will actually, do something.

21:17.643 --> 21:19.177
What happened to you?

21:20.912 --> 21:22.514
You used to...

21:22.614 --> 21:24.182
have a moral core.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.350
For 30 years,

21:25.450 --> 21:27.486
I had one duty.

21:27.586 --> 21:29.655
Decide who was a weapon
and who was not.

21:29.755 --> 21:33.625
-I did that duty to the end.
-To Malcolm's end.

21:35.794 --> 21:38.130
And they still tossed you
out on your ass?

21:38.196 --> 21:40.265
Yes.

21:40.332 --> 21:42.000
I'm going to see a man
about that, aren't I?

21:42.100 --> 21:43.368
I call bullshit.

21:44.670 --> 21:47.973
You betrayed
every friend you've ever had

21:48.040 --> 21:50.208
and it wasn't because of duty.

21:50.309 --> 21:52.878
It was because too much power,

21:52.978 --> 21:54.313
is never enough for you

21:55.647 --> 21:57.282
You loved playing God

21:57.349 --> 22:02.154
with those sweet boys and girls
you sent off to war.

22:02.220 --> 22:05.157
Barely old enough to comprehend
their own specialness,

22:05.223 --> 22:09.828
let alone the word weapon
you stamped to their foreheads.

22:09.895 --> 22:13.231
And you loved lording
that power over the Sisterhood

22:13.332 --> 22:15.701
you so fastidiously nurtured

22:15.801 --> 22:18.136
until the day you discovered

22:18.203 --> 22:21.406
you loved bringing it all
down even more.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.744
That's all this was ever about,
wasn't it?

22:27.179 --> 22:28.680
And this

22:28.747 --> 22:31.750
is all you ever were.

22:31.850 --> 22:35.754
And now you've lost
every friend you've ever had.

22:40.492 --> 22:41.393
Well,

22:42.661 --> 22:44.863
that was bracing.

22:44.930 --> 22:48.700
And if it's just us gals,
probably true.

22:48.767 --> 22:53.004
Not that I'd ever admit that
outside these walls.

22:53.071 --> 22:55.774
Did you really think
you could change the world

22:55.874 --> 23:01.413
with a Jangly hat made out
of serving utensils, hmm?

23:01.513 --> 23:05.350
Another word poem
to stick it to the man?

23:05.417 --> 23:06.251
[giggles]

23:07.219 --> 23:09.588
Art is bullshit.

23:09.688 --> 23:13.191
Art is a narcotic
you suckle while,

23:13.258 --> 23:17.295
life, ambition, purpose
pass you by.

23:17.396 --> 23:20.465
I landed in a field
30 years ago,

23:20.565 --> 23:23.969
with no memory of who I was
or what I believed.

23:24.069 --> 23:27.406
Art saved my life.

23:27.472 --> 23:29.074
You destroyed it.

23:29.941 --> 23:31.710
And I hope you burn in hell.

23:31.777 --> 23:33.645
I hope I'm right here.

23:33.745 --> 23:36.281
Or are you like
your spineless friends?

23:36.381 --> 23:39.084
Or is the memory
that you forgot,

23:39.151 --> 23:40.252
that you're evil?

23:41.887 --> 23:42.821
Just like me.

23:44.389 --> 23:45.223
[gasps]

23:52.798 --> 23:55.500
Go ahead.
Kill me again

23:56.935 --> 23:57.936
Mm-hmm.

24:03.742 --> 24:08.413
For some reason,
It felt appropriate
to say goodbye.

24:08.480 --> 24:13.752
After all, you were
one of the best friends
I've ever known.

24:26.631 --> 24:27.966
Chins up, everyone,

24:28.033 --> 24:29.801
you're doing the right thing
here.

24:29.868 --> 24:31.002
Don't worry about us.

24:31.102 --> 24:33.371
We're all squared away.

24:33.472 --> 24:36.341
Just tell us when it's time
to do some superhero shit

24:36.441 --> 24:39.711
because we're ready, right?

24:39.811 --> 24:41.480
I'm not a superhero.
[chuckles]

24:41.546 --> 24:43.381
Vic is a superhero.

24:43.482 --> 24:49.554
[Dada bicycle bell mumbling]

24:49.654 --> 24:51.523
-What the hell was that?
-Uh...

24:53.358 --> 24:57.128
Don't even...
You can't turn back.

24:57.195 --> 24:58.363
You're on a mission.

24:58.463 --> 25:01.132
Actually, you are on
a mission, right?

25:01.199 --> 25:03.001
-We're just visiting.
-I'm warning you,

25:03.068 --> 25:04.236
there's nothing back there

25:04.336 --> 25:06.538
but more truth
and self-loathing.

25:06.638 --> 25:07.472
And beer.

25:15.313 --> 25:16.314
[gasps]

25:21.152 --> 25:22.921
No, Cliffie.

25:23.021 --> 25:25.724
It's hard to believe
how he got here.

25:25.824 --> 25:28.260
Climate from dirt track
to the Indy 500.

25:28.360 --> 25:32.063
Yeah. You also climbed my wife
every Thursday night,

25:32.163 --> 25:33.064
you fuck.

25:33.164 --> 25:34.900
A lot of years.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.569
A lot of blood spilled, too.

25:37.669 --> 25:39.404
Hell.
We've had our share

25:39.504 --> 25:41.740
of disagreements,
am I right?

25:41.840 --> 25:45.176
Like, would you take Kate
from the front or the back?

25:45.243 --> 25:46.611
Bottom line.

25:46.711 --> 25:49.114
You the best goddamn friend
I ever had.

25:49.214 --> 25:51.449
That's why
me and the boys,

25:51.550 --> 25:53.685
we got something
special for you.

25:53.752 --> 25:56.288
Stay there. Don't move.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.689
Earl, Jethro,
come on, let's go.

25:57.756 --> 25:59.624
Don't worry, I'm not
going anywhere,

25:59.724 --> 26:01.593
you wife fucking fuck up.

26:05.564 --> 26:07.098
Okay. Think Cliffie,

26:07.198 --> 26:10.569
those artists freaks
did this Flagellation thing...

26:10.635 --> 26:14.873
Then they send me
to my subconscious
for something good?

26:14.940 --> 26:16.541
I don't think so.

26:16.608 --> 26:18.276
[all] Yeah.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.280
[rock music playing]

26:28.153 --> 26:29.754
To the King.

26:29.821 --> 26:31.923
[all cheering]

26:37.095 --> 26:39.130
Then again, I have been wrong.

26:39.230 --> 26:40.398
I've been wrong.

26:42.067 --> 26:44.169
[men whooping]

26:44.269 --> 26:46.471
Get some, dude, you're the man.

26:47.806 --> 26:50.609
-I'm the man?
-You're the man.

26:50.675 --> 26:52.277
You know what I am.

26:52.344 --> 26:54.512
I'm the fucking man.

-Who's the king?

-[crowd cheering]
-I am the fucking King!

27:02.587 --> 27:04.022
We'll be safe here.

27:04.122 --> 27:06.024
It's comfortable. Secure.

27:06.124 --> 27:09.461
I've reinforced
the cotton sheets
with the flannel sheets.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.597
That's it?

27:12.664 --> 27:15.800
You've only secured enough
for yourself.

27:15.867 --> 27:17.035
Family sized.

27:18.670 --> 27:20.038
Can I get a beer?

27:20.138 --> 27:21.806
You're an adult,
but you're a kid

27:21.873 --> 27:23.208
who lives inside an adult.

27:23.308 --> 27:25.543
So sure, why not, fuck it.
Here.

-Mm. Gross.
-More for me.

You're on the lookout
for something?

27:53.838 --> 27:55.140
Aren't we all?

27:55.206 --> 27:56.307
Wow.

27:57.509 --> 27:59.678
You even guard
your subconscious.

28:00.378 --> 28:01.479
That's impressive.

28:05.350 --> 28:06.384
Are they right?

28:06.484 --> 28:09.054
-Who?
-The Sisterhood of Dada.

28:09.154 --> 28:10.755
I mean, is it important for me
to know

28:10.855 --> 28:13.024
why there's a General Tony
and Vic's subconscious?

28:14.025 --> 28:15.193
Maybe it is.

28:15.260 --> 28:16.995
Maybe knowing
will move us forward.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.497
Okay.

28:19.564 --> 28:22.534
Why does Larry Sub
stare out the window?

28:22.600 --> 28:24.102
None of your goddamn business.

28:24.736 --> 28:26.438
Hmm.

28:26.538 --> 28:29.607
Let's go into the Fort and uh,
we'll wait this thing out, huh?

28:30.742 --> 28:31.876
We've got snacks.

28:31.943 --> 28:33.945
Oh, why didn't you say so?

28:34.045 --> 28:35.080
Lead the way, sir.

28:49.961 --> 28:52.197
[indistinct conversation]

29:18.790 --> 29:19.791
Fuck me.

29:20.925 --> 29:22.227
Fuck you.

29:27.999 --> 29:32.437
[Shipley]<i> On that day,</i>
<i>Rita knew she had</i>
<i>vengeance in her heart...</i>

29:34.439 --> 29:36.074
Godamn right, I do.

29:36.141 --> 29:38.176
[Shipley] w<i> hich was a shame</i>
<i>because the last 30 years</i>

29:38.276 --> 29:41.346
<i>had infused in her</i>
<i>a new found confidence and joy</i>

29:41.446 --> 29:44.949
<i>that had been so sorely lacking</i>
<i>in all her years before,</i>

29:45.016 --> 29:46.651
<i>in her "other" life.</i>

29:46.751 --> 29:49.087
Tough shit
on a popsicle stick, Shipley.

29:49.154 --> 29:52.857
[Shipley] But,<i> as she rockets</i>
<i>through the space</i>
<i>time continuum,</i>

29:52.957 --> 29:54.859
<i>the inevitable forces</i>
<i>of physics</i>

29:54.959 --> 29:58.630
<i>and sheer story inertia</i>
<i>bring the memories</i>

29:58.696 --> 30:01.466
<i>of that "other" life</i>
<i>flooding back.</i>

30:01.533 --> 30:05.003
<i>And with them comes</i>
<i>the shame and insecurity</i>

30:05.103 --> 30:06.671
<i>she'd left long behind</i>

30:06.771 --> 30:10.175
<i>to a life once lived</i>
<i>and to be lived again.</i>

30:10.275 --> 30:12.710
<i>With these new</i>
<i>old memories returning,</i>

30:12.811 --> 30:16.214
<i>Rita had to wonder what would</i>
<i>become of the old new memories.</i>

30:16.314 --> 30:18.349
<i>If that makes any sense at all.</i>

30:18.449 --> 30:21.452
<i>And what of the one memory</i>
<i>she absolutely,</i>

30:21.519 --> 30:25.023
<i>positively could not bear</i>
<i>to lose?</i>

30:25.123 --> 30:29.227
<i>She was convinced, this memory</i>
<i>was so embedded in her heart</i>

30:29.327 --> 30:31.863
<i>there was no way</i>
<i>it could ever be extracted.</i>

30:31.963 --> 30:34.833
<i>But could she ever</i>
<i>truly be sure?</i>

30:34.899 --> 30:36.668
<i>Could she ever truly guarantee</i>

30:36.734 --> 30:40.138
<i>she and her beloved's bond</i>
<i>would never be broken?</i>

30:40.205 --> 30:42.340
<i>Turns out, when you have</i>
<i>a time machine</i>

30:42.407 --> 30:43.908
<i>of indeterminate function,</i>

30:44.008 --> 30:46.544
<i>the answer is, in fact, yes.</i>

30:46.644 --> 30:48.346
<i>Rita would have her vengeance.</i>

30:48.413 --> 30:52.250
<i>She would pursue Madame Rouge</i>
<i>to the ends of time.</i>

30:52.350 --> 30:55.753
<i>But first, she would make</i>
<i>a hard left to the Poconos</i>

30:55.854 --> 30:59.190
<i>to ensure her lover's loop</i>
<i>will never be broken.</i>

31:04.095 --> 31:06.397
<i>Rita would have it all!</i>

31:09.534 --> 31:10.935
So... do we just sit here

31:11.035 --> 31:14.272
and wait for the Eternal
Flagellation to end?

31:16.541 --> 31:19.043
[inhales and exhales]

31:19.110 --> 31:20.378
I heard Larry-

31:20.445 --> 31:22.780
he wants to talk it out.

31:27.085 --> 31:29.020
I just thought it might
help pass the time.

31:29.087 --> 31:33.024
Talk? Are we like--
Spill our shit talk?

31:33.091 --> 31:34.859
No, thank you.

31:34.926 --> 31:37.462
[Tony] We relive
our pain every day.

31:37.562 --> 31:39.197
Why do we have to air it out?

31:39.264 --> 31:42.267
Maybe because we have a duty?

31:42.367 --> 31:46.404
A duty to our conscious self
so that they can
live a better life?

31:47.605 --> 31:49.908
They're stuck because of us.

31:49.974 --> 31:51.242
Life is about duty.

31:51.309 --> 31:53.411
And it's about what
and who you serve.

31:53.478 --> 31:56.781
And I know you understand that.
You're a father, I know you do.

31:56.881 --> 31:58.616
You have a duty
to your daughter, don't you?

31:59.717 --> 32:01.452
Okay, that's enough.

32:01.552 --> 32:03.621
Don't bring Clara into this.

32:04.122 --> 32:05.456
Why not?

32:05.556 --> 32:07.158
Our conscious selves
never talk about this stuff.

32:07.258 --> 32:09.294
Duty and daughters
and Fathers--

32:09.394 --> 32:11.996
[sighs] Can we not
talk about Fathers?

32:12.096 --> 32:13.331
So we just don't talk at all?

32:14.465 --> 32:16.100
[Human Cliff] Exactly!

32:16.167 --> 32:17.769
No talking! Just...

32:19.070 --> 32:22.507
[Cliff] Finally!
I deserve something good!

32:22.607 --> 32:25.476
That's why God gave me
this memory

32:25.576 --> 32:28.780
and a three-month supply
of Parky meds.

32:28.846 --> 32:31.582
I know it's your celebration
so I'm guessin'
you're the head guy here.

32:31.649 --> 32:33.518
[chuckling] Uh uh.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.486
Give me all that sugar, Sugar.

32:35.586 --> 32:37.188
There's somethin'
I gotta tell you...

32:37.288 --> 32:38.656
[chuckling] Oh, God.

32:38.756 --> 32:40.959
Whisper those sweet,
naughty nothings, Darlin'.

32:42.627 --> 32:43.928
That Camaro outside?

32:45.196 --> 32:47.432
There's a little girl
alone in the backseat.

32:52.170 --> 32:54.973
Oh, fuck no. Uh-huh.

32:55.039 --> 32:58.443
No, no. Not my problem anymore.
Goodbye!

32:58.509 --> 33:01.779
Thank you! It's been good
takin' a trip down memory lane

33:01.846 --> 33:04.115
but I want no part
of this bullshit!

33:07.986 --> 33:10.154
That shit is from the weird
lady in the gas mask.

33:12.657 --> 33:15.159
Fuck it. Bye, assholes!

33:17.662 --> 33:18.629

33:21.165 --> 33:22.133
Larry?

33:23.701 --> 33:25.737
Larry? Larry?

33:25.837 --> 33:27.705
-Cliff?
-Hey!

33:27.805 --> 33:29.474
-You okay?
-What does it look like?

33:29.540 --> 33:31.376
-I'm in hell.
-Tell me about it,

33:31.476 --> 33:33.745
it's those fucking
Dada fucks, right?

33:33.845 --> 33:35.847
And our Sub fucks are up top
probably saying,

33:35.913 --> 33:38.249
"God knows what to whoever
the fuck about us!"

33:38.349 --> 33:39.917
Fuck this Freaky Friday shit!

33:40.018 --> 33:42.353
Yeah. That's not even
close to Freaky Friday.

33:42.420 --> 33:44.022
You want to get out
of here or not?

33:44.088 --> 33:45.423
Yes. How?

33:45.523 --> 33:48.393
Look at that spiral thingy.
Follow me.

33:58.236 --> 34:01.105
[Jane] I don't know
about the rest of you

34:01.205 --> 34:05.777
but I don't have a duty
to anyone.

34:05.877 --> 34:08.579
No one's ever honored
their duty to me.

34:08.679 --> 34:11.716
So you're saying that duty
isn't a thing anymore?

34:12.717 --> 34:15.086
Duty is all that I am.

34:15.186 --> 34:17.522
I'm saying, fuck fatherhood!

34:17.588 --> 34:19.624
Whoa! You're like, what? Seven?

34:19.724 --> 34:21.926
Really? This is after
you gave her the beer?

34:22.026 --> 34:26.130
[chuckles] Though...
Maybe Kay is onto something.

34:26.230 --> 34:31.102
I watched Little Vic honor
his father more than himself

34:31.202 --> 34:35.706
and now that I'm up here,
yeah, I got questions.

34:35.773 --> 34:37.208
No, you don't.

34:37.275 --> 34:41.045
'Cause A, Number one,
we're going to avoid our shit,

34:41.112 --> 34:42.814
just like we always do

34:42.914 --> 34:44.882
B, Number two,

34:44.949 --> 34:48.820
stop blaming your parents
for your own fuck ups.

34:48.920 --> 34:50.955
Says the parent who fucked up.

34:51.989 --> 34:53.458
[chuckles] What?

34:53.558 --> 34:55.560
Oh, sorry, [chuckles]

34:55.626 --> 34:59.230
was I the parent who was
fucking the crew chief

34:59.297 --> 35:00.498
down by the train tracks?

35:00.598 --> 35:02.266
So it was better
to be fucking the Nanny?

35:02.333 --> 35:04.168
I bet your conscious self
is down there now

35:04.268 --> 35:06.838
finding a way to screw her
on a ping pong table.

35:06.938 --> 35:09.974
Hey! Don't you dare
pretend to understand

35:10.074 --> 35:12.343
that you know
what's going on inside me.

35:12.443 --> 35:14.812
Can you two grow the fuck up?

35:14.912 --> 35:17.515
You know what,
I thought you is useless.

35:17.615 --> 35:20.585
You, of all the people
swimming around inside you,

35:20.651 --> 35:23.788
we get the one
who can't do anything helpful,

35:23.855 --> 35:28.426
like, flit my fat
fucking ass out of here.

35:28.493 --> 35:31.496
-I don't need them.
-Newsflash:

35:31.596 --> 35:32.763
You do.

35:32.830 --> 35:34.832
We all do.
We need to get the fuck out

35:34.932 --> 35:37.101
of this pillow fort fuckery!

35:41.973 --> 35:45.543
So, that's it, you're just
gonna party forever?

35:45.643 --> 35:47.178
[sighs]

35:47.278 --> 35:50.348
No, because there is no
forever for me,

35:50.448 --> 35:51.282
I'm dying.

35:56.654 --> 35:57.622
What?

35:58.990 --> 36:01.192
[sniffles]

36:01.292 --> 36:06.164
The first part of my life,
I was a fuckin' red neck.

36:06.230 --> 36:08.966
Dirt poor,
didn't have a pot to shit in.

36:11.002 --> 36:13.471
But then I found race cars,

36:13.538 --> 36:16.407
and that was my ticket
out of hell.

36:16.507 --> 36:20.077
When you come from nothin'
you don't know what to do

36:20.178 --> 36:22.547
with the somethin'
that you get.

36:22.647 --> 36:24.882
People started
treatin' me differently.

36:24.982 --> 36:28.386
They started treatin' me
like I'm, I was special.

36:29.687 --> 36:31.989
And once you get
a taste of special-

36:32.056 --> 36:34.058
hmm, there's no turning back.

36:37.228 --> 36:39.564
But I never really felt
like I deserved it,

36:42.066 --> 36:44.268
so I plugged up the holes
with drugs and women.

36:45.369 --> 36:48.005
I was king of the race track

36:48.072 --> 36:52.276
but inside I was an empty fuck.
But, but, I was a king.

36:52.376 --> 36:55.246
And this king [sobs]
decapitated his wife

37:09.427 --> 37:11.929

37:12.029 --> 37:14.298

37:16.033 --> 37:21.772
Because...
Parkinson's has me now. Um...

37:23.474 --> 37:25.376
I'm deteriorating.

37:25.443 --> 37:29.547
But Abracadabra, I'm going
to do the most
ordinary thing that you can do.

37:31.482 --> 37:32.717
I'm gonna die...

37:35.052 --> 37:36.988
slowly... [sighs]

37:37.088 --> 37:38.389
before your very eyes.

37:42.593 --> 37:43.594
So, fuck it.

38:29.006 --> 38:30.374
He doesn't even know
you're here.

38:30.474 --> 38:31.442

how about I shove that

If the message is to move
forward out of this
rainbow vomit, I'm in!

40:42.606 --> 40:45.976
Um... who wants a piece
of stripper cake?

40:48.979 --> 40:50.080
Did you see Mom?

40:53.451 --> 40:54.318
I did.

40:56.120 --> 40:58.122
And I changed the script.

40:58.189 --> 40:59.824
Said the things
I should have said.

41:01.792 --> 41:04.428
Are you blaming me?

41:04.495 --> 41:06.697
Are you saying
I should have said
something else?

41:06.797 --> 41:09.600
No. You should have done
something else.

41:10.968 --> 41:12.336
You think I don't know that?

41:14.472 --> 41:17.174
How do you think it feels to be
the worst memory
of someone's life?

41:17.274 --> 41:19.443
[chuckles]
You're not the worst, okay?

41:19.510 --> 41:21.278
There are others
far worse than you.

41:21.345 --> 41:22.813
Then why am I here?

41:22.880 --> 41:25.349
You're the day I committed
to lying to myself.

41:27.718 --> 41:29.453
-What?
-I got news for you,

41:29.520 --> 41:31.722
I'm from the day
that you hid from love.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.493
That's why you secretly
like those bandages.

41:35.559 --> 41:37.728
They give you an excuse
to keep people away.

41:40.531 --> 41:42.867
You're afraid you don't know
how to love.

41:44.635 --> 41:46.237
You think
you're not worthy of it.

41:50.808 --> 41:52.076
[sighs]

41:52.176 --> 41:54.211
Maybe you are the worst
memory of my life.

41:55.846 --> 41:59.583
You know, on my wedding day,
Mom invited me into her trauma

41:59.683 --> 42:02.386
and then I sucked the people
into my trauma.

42:02.486 --> 42:03.521
[sighs]

42:05.322 --> 42:07.691
You've got to learn
how to let love in, guy.

42:11.896 --> 42:13.430
One step at a time.

42:13.531 --> 42:16.166
-I have a duty to myself.
-Yeah.

42:17.334 --> 42:18.335
You do.

42:20.037 --> 42:25.676
I live that memory,
every moment of it, every day.

42:29.113 --> 42:31.048
Make it worth
what I'm going through.

42:32.883 --> 42:33.751
Can you do that?

42:49.099 --> 42:50.134
I can try.

43:00.411 --> 43:01.712
Whoa!

43:06.383 --> 43:10.220
Okay, that was beautiful.

43:11.488 --> 43:12.790
Show's over, folks!

43:14.458 --> 43:15.392
Is it?

43:16.660 --> 43:20.130
-Oh, come fucking on.
-I know, I know.

43:20.230 --> 43:21.999
You seriously
want to spill our shit?

43:22.099 --> 43:23.801
No, I don't.

43:23.901 --> 43:27.605
But then I saw
Larry holding hand
with himself,

43:27.671 --> 43:29.406
and it was really fucking nice!

43:29.473 --> 43:31.075
-[groans]
-So, fuck it.

43:31.141 --> 43:34.244
Do you wanna know
what I live through

43:34.311 --> 43:36.747
every fucking day?

43:43.020 --> 43:48.192
Every day from dusk until dawn,

43:48.292 --> 43:50.027
I leave my daughter in the car

43:50.127 --> 43:54.098
so that I could go do some blow
and cozy up to a stripper.

43:55.799 --> 43:59.036
That's what I do,
every fucking day.

43:59.870 --> 44:01.538
I say, "Fuck you"

44:01.639 --> 44:05.943
to fatherhood because
fatherhood doesn't
make me feel special

44:09.279 --> 44:10.614
As a dad,

44:10.681 --> 44:15.052
I'm just part of the wallpaper.
[sighs wearily]

44:16.987 --> 44:19.323
Doin' blow.
Fucking strippers.

44:19.390 --> 44:22.559
That shit makes me
feel like a king.

44:22.660 --> 44:24.728
Every day, when party's over,

44:24.828 --> 44:26.363
I come back to the car,

44:26.463 --> 44:29.733
I look my daughter in the eyes
and I feel...

44:30.668 --> 44:31.735
Nothing.

44:32.970 --> 44:35.406
No guilt. Remorse. Shame.

44:37.675 --> 44:39.677
I got my rocks off

44:39.743 --> 44:42.212
and that has earned me
another week

44:42.312 --> 44:45.049
of stomaching
changing dirty diapers

44:46.150 --> 44:48.152
until the next race,

44:48.986 --> 44:53.724
Nanny, stripper.

44:53.824 --> 44:58.662
When I can go back to feeling
like a fucking king again.

44:58.729 --> 45:01.832
You left your daughter
in the car to go party?

45:01.899 --> 45:05.669
Look, I didn't sign up
for this shit!

45:05.736 --> 45:07.938
That kid interrupted my life.

45:08.038 --> 45:11.608
Why did I have to stop living
because I stuck
my dick in a hole?

45:11.709 --> 45:13.444
I want to feel special, too!

45:13.544 --> 45:16.213
You know, at some point,
the party's gotta stop.

45:17.681 --> 45:21.185
I may be stuck on a loop,
but I'm not fucking blind.

45:22.019 --> 45:23.854
You're on the same track.

45:23.921 --> 45:27.091
You're tripping balls
on Parkinson's meds,

45:27.191 --> 45:29.960
it's like it's 1984
all over again.

45:30.060 --> 45:32.730
You're selling
their shit on Ebay.

45:32.796 --> 45:34.598
I'm fucking exhausted.

45:34.698 --> 45:38.569
But you have a second chance
with Clara and Rory,

45:38.635 --> 45:41.572
but instead you're doing
the same shit all over again,

45:41.638 --> 45:43.574
that's killing both of us.

45:46.076 --> 45:47.244
Is it worth it?

45:49.747 --> 45:52.783
Answer me, is it worth it?

45:52.883 --> 45:54.151
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you, too!

45:54.251 --> 45:56.053
-Fuck you!
-Fuck you!

45:56.120 --> 45:57.621
And fuck all of ya'll!

46:09.099 --> 46:10.100
Dude.

46:18.609 --> 46:20.010
This shit is crazy.

46:32.589 --> 46:33.524
[sighs]

46:35.459 --> 46:36.693
I'm fine.

46:36.794 --> 46:38.695
I don't need
no pop psychology.

46:41.532 --> 46:45.002
Okay then,
we'll just stand here
and protect everyone.

46:45.803 --> 46:47.838
I have one question, sir?

46:47.938 --> 46:48.772
Who protects us?

46:48.839 --> 46:49.873
I don't need protection.

46:51.108 --> 46:52.376
No question about that,

46:52.476 --> 46:53.844
you've always been
a good soldier.

46:53.944 --> 46:57.147
Brave, disciplined. Warrior.

46:58.615 --> 47:00.818
You saw the memory I came from.

47:00.884 --> 47:02.119
Hmm?

47:02.186 --> 47:05.489
Yeah, I was a child.

47:05.556 --> 47:07.891
-You think anyone saw that?
-That I was a child?

47:07.991 --> 47:10.227
No, I don't think
anyone saw that

47:10.327 --> 47:12.529
-or cared.
-Well, I did.

47:12.629 --> 47:14.565
And on that day,
I saw you go straight

47:14.665 --> 47:17.734
from being a 10-year old child
to a soldier.

47:17.835 --> 47:19.636
Trying to please everyone,

47:19.703 --> 47:23.307
always saying the right things,
never making a mistake.

47:23.373 --> 47:24.575
You became perfect.

47:25.909 --> 47:29.313
But you lost something
very important.

47:32.850 --> 47:35.652
[sniffles, quivers]

47:35.719 --> 47:37.154
My childhood.

47:37.221 --> 47:38.222
That's correct, sir.

47:40.557 --> 47:41.892
I'd never get that back.

47:41.992 --> 47:44.328
Yeah, but you can make
your own choices now.

47:44.394 --> 47:47.364
And maybe instead
of doing things that made you
a good soldier,

47:47.431 --> 47:49.032
you could do some wrong things.

47:49.099 --> 47:51.535
You can make
some strong choices,

47:51.602 --> 47:53.270
even if they're wrong.

47:53.370 --> 47:54.771
What do you think
I was trying to do

47:54.872 --> 47:57.040
before
this Eternal Flagellation?

47:57.908 --> 47:58.775
I know.

47:59.710 --> 48:01.445
I'm not here to criticize.

48:01.545 --> 48:05.883
I am here to say, keep going.
Hmm?

48:06.717 --> 48:07.951
Have some fun.

48:09.052 --> 48:10.854
Find your happiness.

48:12.222 --> 48:14.224
Play.

48:14.291 --> 48:17.261
And then you take back
what was taken from you.

48:20.797 --> 48:21.865
This is crazy.

48:22.566 --> 48:23.533
[scoffs]

48:25.469 --> 48:28.038
Why am I even listening
to somebody
I didn't even want?

48:30.440 --> 48:31.909
I didn't want a soldier!

48:33.143 --> 48:34.411
I was a fucking kid.

48:47.624 --> 48:50.327
Harry said you didn't
want us anymore.

48:50.427 --> 48:52.896
What did we say
the lesson of the day was?

48:52.963 --> 48:54.564
Seriously?

48:54.631 --> 48:57.401
-You want to do a lesson
of the day now?
-Yes.

48:59.970 --> 49:00.971
Because it's you.

49:01.939 --> 49:04.074
You just cause me more trauma.

49:04.141 --> 49:06.777
Everything you do
just brings me more pain.

49:08.745 --> 49:12.015
And it's time for me to grow up
and be on my own.

49:12.115 --> 49:15.786
No, you can't survive
without me.

49:16.453 --> 49:17.688
I'd like to try.

49:17.788 --> 49:20.490
No. No.

49:20.590 --> 49:24.528
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no,

50:53.717 --> 50:54.551
Okay!

50:54.618 --> 50:55.952
I think we can all agree,

50:56.053 --> 50:58.688
that what happens
in the Eternal Flagellation,

50:58.755 --> 51:00.757
stays in the Eternal Flagella--

51:02.359 --> 51:03.794
You want to talk
about parenting

51:03.894 --> 51:05.228
or you want to talk about--
