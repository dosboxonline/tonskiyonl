WEBVTT

01:35.470 --> 01:36.555
Did you find him?

01:38.056 --> 01:39.141
Is he okay?

01:41.768 --> 01:43.103
What? What happened?

01:59.578 --> 02:01.413
Jesus fucking Christ, Leighton.

02:10.923 --> 02:11.924
Fuck!

02:23.393 --> 02:24.645
Fuck.

02:46.250 --> 02:49.378
I take the blame for what happened.

02:51.588 --> 02:54.883
You hear me, Jason?
I take the blame for what happened.

02:55.926 --> 02:57.886
You came back, and we were not prepared.

02:59.972 --> 03:01.807
We were not prepared for you to be as...

03:06.186 --> 03:08.272
unwell as you are.

03:10.357 --> 03:11.608
I don't wanna restrain you.

03:11.608 --> 03:15.654
But as long as you're a danger to yourself
and others, this situation can't change.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.032
Did you--

03:21.326 --> 03:25.831
Did you send that woman
to Daniela's apartment?

03:49.521 --> 03:53.317
I am just trying to help you remember
the brilliant man you are.

03:56.069 --> 03:58.447
And this incredible thing you created.

04:00.324 --> 04:01.325
Fuck off.

04:12.294 --> 04:13.295
Thank you.

04:23.931 --> 04:25.098
Thank you.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.145
What is this?

04:30.145 --> 04:31.563
- That's wine.
- Uh-huh.

04:31.563 --> 04:33.273
- I got a second bottle...
- Okay.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.399
...'cause it was so nice.

04:34.399 --> 04:36.401
Yeah, it was. It was great.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.446
It was also a hundred dollars.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.287
What?

04:48.413 --> 04:50.791
Feels like you're trying to sleep with me.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.212
I am definitely trying to sleep with you.

04:55.212 --> 04:56.380
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

04:56.380 --> 05:00.968
Okay, but the, you know,
full seduction thing,

05:01.635 --> 05:02.970
it's been a minute.

05:04.263 --> 05:06.723
Don't get me wrong, it's amazing.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.184
Keep doing it, but--

05:09.184 --> 05:10.853
Hey, hey!

05:11.979 --> 05:15.232
- Oh, my God.
- I can't linger.

05:15.232 --> 05:17.985
Mike is out getting our car,
but I saw you two lovebirds

05:17.985 --> 05:20.320
and wanted to come say hi.

05:20.320 --> 05:23.156
Hi. No, I'm glad you did.
It's good to see you.

05:23.156 --> 05:25.075
- Yeah. I'm so excited about tomorrow.
- Tomorrow.

05:25.075 --> 05:27.494
- What can we bring?
- Nothing. Just your beautiful selves.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.037
Okay, perfection.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.789
- All right. I'll see you later. Bye.
- Bye.

05:30.789 --> 05:32.541
Yeah. See ya.

05:36.962 --> 05:38.964
What was...

05:39.715 --> 05:41.425
- Barbara?
- Yeah, Barbara.

05:42.509 --> 05:45.637
- What's going on tomorrow?
- Our dinner party.

05:48.098 --> 05:49.433
At the house?

05:50.225 --> 05:51.768
Yeah, we talked about it.

05:53.645 --> 05:55.564
- You forgot.
- Yeah.

05:55.564 --> 05:57.441
- Yeah, you did.
- No-- Hold-- Yes.

05:57.441 --> 06:00.152
- Yes. Yes.
- Yeah.

06:02.821 --> 06:04.823
Who all is coming again?

06:20.547 --> 06:21.798
He'll be right with you.

06:42.903 --> 06:44.738
This was my grandfather's office.

06:45.822 --> 06:47.658
Keep it exactly the way he left it.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.163
I'm Detective Mason.

06:54.498 --> 06:56.208
Leighton Vance. Pleasure.

06:58.836 --> 07:00.587
Your family was in aviation?

07:02.422 --> 07:04.424
He founded Velocity 52 years ago.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.760
Built jet engines.

07:09.221 --> 07:10.681
Is that you and him?

07:10.681 --> 07:12.474
My parents died when I was young.

07:13.475 --> 07:14.476
He raised me.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.564
Please, this way.

07:24.736 --> 07:28.657
<i>So Jason Dessen. He worked here for...</i>

07:28.657 --> 07:30.325
Eight years.

07:30.325 --> 07:32.077
And when was the last time you saw him?

07:32.786 --> 07:34.454
It's been more than a year now.

07:34.454 --> 07:37.207
You know, one day, he just didn't show up
for work, and I haven't seen him since.

07:37.207 --> 07:38.959
No one has, as far as I know.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.795
You sure you don't want a coffee? Water?

07:41.795 --> 07:43.255
- No, I'm good.
- No? Okay.

07:46.633 --> 07:50.762
You know, I did speak to the police
when Jason first went missing.

07:53.098 --> 07:54.850
What do you guys do here?

07:56.894 --> 07:57.895
R and D.

07:57.895 --> 07:59.396
What's that mean?

07:59.396 --> 08:01.064
Research and development?

08:01.565 --> 08:04.234
No, I know what it means.

08:05.777 --> 08:06.904
What do you make?

08:07.571 --> 08:10.115
Transistor-based silicon qubits
for quantum and healing processors.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.284
That's a mouthful.

08:13.785 --> 08:14.620
You know,

08:15.204 --> 08:18.498
there was another woman, Blair Caplan.

08:19.583 --> 08:21.335
She worked here too, right?

08:21.919 --> 08:23.962
Yeah. Blair.

08:23.962 --> 08:25.506
Yeah, she went missing.

08:26.798 --> 08:29.343
- Eighteen months ago?
- Yeah. It...

08:32.221 --> 08:34.139
hit everyone here really hard.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.436
So were she and Jason in the same group?

08:40.062 --> 08:42.356
No, Blair was in process improvement.

08:45.234 --> 08:46.652
What's this all about?

08:50.948 --> 08:53.909
Jason Dessen checked into
John of God General three nights ago.

08:54.785 --> 08:55.786
What?

08:57.037 --> 08:58.413
You didn't know?

08:58.413 --> 09:00.290
No, no, I didn't.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.750
Is he okay?

09:01.750 --> 09:02.876
Unknown.

09:03.418 --> 09:05.879
He left the hospital before I got there.

09:06.421 --> 09:10.968
But he was apparently seen
at an art show later that night.

09:12.344 --> 09:15.389
I thought he might have
reached out to you.

09:15.389 --> 09:16.890
To me? No.

09:17.516 --> 09:18.600
I wish he had.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.855
Well, we're trying to find him.

09:23.438 --> 09:24.439
Wow.

09:27.776 --> 09:30.404
According to my predecessor's notes,

09:30.404 --> 09:33.657
he was in a relationship with another
employee at the time of his disappearance.

09:33.657 --> 09:34.741
Yeah.

09:35.742 --> 09:36.785
Dr. Amanda Lucas.

09:38.954 --> 09:41.164
Is Dr. Lucas in the office today?

09:52.426 --> 09:53.594
How'd it go?

09:54.761 --> 09:56.555
How'd lying to the police go?

09:57.347 --> 09:59.099
Awesome. Super great.

10:00.976 --> 10:02.644
Dawn said she tried to dial 911.

10:02.644 --> 10:03.687
So she shot her?

10:03.687 --> 10:05.105
Lower your voice.

10:07.983 --> 10:09.026
Leighton.

10:11.570 --> 10:16.450
I told her to bring them both here, okay?
I didn't know that she would--

10:16.450 --> 10:18.660
Because she's a deeply unstable person...

10:18.660 --> 10:20.954
- Amanda.
- ...who refuses treatment for her PTSD.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.123
- Amanda.
- I warned you about hiring her.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.584
Enough! Enough.

10:27.753 --> 10:28.754
Shit.

10:29.588 --> 10:32.674
Did she mention Blair? The detective.

10:33.467 --> 10:34.676
Of course she did.

10:35.552 --> 10:38.764
Amanda, Chicago PD is so close
to connecting the dots on Jason,

10:38.764 --> 10:39.973
Blair, all of it.

10:41.141 --> 10:42.893
You know what happens if they do.

10:42.893 --> 10:44.978
We lose everything we've worked for.
We go to prison.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.148
It's been a year and a half
since the box came online.

10:48.148 --> 10:50.192
- I've sank a billion into this shit.
- Fuck your billions.

10:50.192 --> 10:52.736
Fuck my billions? Oh, fuck my billions.

10:52.736 --> 10:55.697
We have four people missing.
And now Daniela Vargas.

10:55.697 --> 10:58.700
Meanwhile, he somehow found a way back.

10:59.368 --> 11:02.204
How? How the fuck did he do that?

11:26.728 --> 11:28.522
I mean, what the hell happened to him?

11:28.522 --> 11:30.566
Maybe superposition is brain-damaging.

11:30.566 --> 11:34.194
So what,
he scrambled his memories? His identity?

11:34.820 --> 11:35.821
I don't know.

11:37.573 --> 11:40.993
That's why I wanted more testing.
There's so much we don't know. I need--

11:40.993 --> 11:42.119
<i>Hey.</i>

11:45.747 --> 11:46.832
<i>Okay.</i>

11:49.501 --> 11:51.128
<i>Help me remember.</i>

12:10.147 --> 12:11.190
Hey, bud.

12:15.110 --> 12:16.445
Brought you some clothes.

12:17.279 --> 12:18.614
Thank you.

12:22.284 --> 12:23.285
Listen,

12:24.745 --> 12:25.913
just curious,

12:27.456 --> 12:28.790
why'd you run?

12:29.875 --> 12:31.210
I was scared.

12:31.210 --> 12:32.836
So you went to Daniela's apartment?

12:33.712 --> 12:38.091
She's-- She was an old friend of mine.

12:38.717 --> 12:43.013
I was just looking for someone,
anybody, that I remembered.

12:43.931 --> 12:45.015
That's all.

12:47.184 --> 12:49.978
Did you tell her
or anyone about this place?

12:52.856 --> 12:54.525
I don't know what this place is.

12:57.528 --> 13:02.658
And you and I, you said we're close.

13:19.299 --> 13:23.178
What exactly are we protecting here

13:23.178 --> 13:27.766
that would justify killing a person?

13:27.766 --> 13:29.852
Just-- I mean, for any of us?

13:29.852 --> 13:31.061
It doesn't.

13:32.062 --> 13:36.567
Listen to me. Everyone here has given
everything to your work. Everything.

13:39.236 --> 13:43.490
And any one of us would
lay down our lives to protect it.

13:44.616 --> 13:45.951
Including you.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.162
Especially you.

13:56.420 --> 13:57.462
I would?

14:00.132 --> 14:01.925
You've forgotten what we built.

14:05.554 --> 14:06.805
So show me.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.484
- <i>Name, please.</i>
- Leighton Vance.

14:20.152 --> 14:22.029
<i>Please enter passcode.</i>

14:26.617 --> 14:27.951
<i>Access granted.</i>

14:56.188 --> 15:00.484
A long time ago,
I tried to build a one-inch cube

15:00.484 --> 15:05.405
that could put an aluminum nitride disc
in superposition.

15:06.240 --> 15:09.535
To actually create what SchrÃ¶dinger
had imagined for...

15:11.745 --> 15:13.580
- his cat.
- That's right.

15:13.580 --> 15:15.332
So you remember your breakthrough.

15:17.668 --> 15:19.378
When you started scaling up in size?

15:20.504 --> 15:22.381
No, I never finished.

15:23.173 --> 15:26.844
Could never find a way to fully shield
the box from the outside environment,

15:26.844 --> 15:30.848
and the superposition state
kept collapsing.

15:31.974 --> 15:35.686
Okay. So your memories stopped
before winning the Pavia.

15:37.437 --> 15:41.358
Is this some kind of alloy?
I mean, that can't be the answer.

15:41.358 --> 15:42.442
It is.

15:44.236 --> 15:45.946
Jason, you came up with so much more.

15:47.281 --> 15:48.407
See, underneath that alloy

15:48.407 --> 15:50.993
is a layer of active, adaptive shielding
that you developed.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.536
- Adaptive?
- Yeah.

15:53.704 --> 15:56.707
Adaptive. Fuck. That's it.

15:56.707 --> 16:00.794
It's full of smart materials
that generate fields,

16:00.794 --> 16:04.298
cancel out whatever radiation
or sound tries to make it inside.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.968
It's like the world's most advanced
noise-canceling headphones.

16:07.968 --> 16:12.681
It doesn't just block the sound,
it blocks the noise of everything outside.

16:12.681 --> 16:16.351
And gives off a robust magnetic field
in exchange for that trick.

16:17.477 --> 16:18.896
What's inside?

16:39.583 --> 16:43.170
So far, you were the only person
to go inside and return.

16:45.339 --> 16:48.091
There are others? What happened to them?

16:48.091 --> 16:52.471
We don't know.
Recording devices can't be used inside.

16:53.472 --> 16:54.848
How many were there?

16:57.184 --> 16:58.393
Three.

16:59.311 --> 17:02.856
How do you sweep
three missing people under a rug?

17:06.151 --> 17:07.444
The first was an employee.

17:09.445 --> 17:11.323
See, when Blair didn't return,

17:11.949 --> 17:13.700
you started talking about going next.

17:14.952 --> 17:18.539
I mean, we tried to dissuade you,
but you felt guilty.

17:18.539 --> 17:20.249
Said you'd built the box,

17:21.375 --> 17:24.461
that you should be the one
to figure out how it works, and you did.

17:34.596 --> 17:37.140
And what happened after I disappeared?

17:38.433 --> 17:41.770
We put out a call for volunteers.
Anonymously.

17:43.230 --> 17:47.401
Did they even have any idea
what they were signing up for?

17:49.528 --> 17:50.529
Eventually.

18:09.798 --> 18:10.799
Please.

19:29.378 --> 19:31.672
And poof. You're gone.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.466
Until three days ago.

20:05.247 --> 20:06.623
You said any one I want?

20:07.249 --> 20:09.168
Sky's the limit, kiddo.

20:10.043 --> 20:12.212
Let's call it
an early birthday present, huh?

20:13.005 --> 20:14.006
Epic.

20:22.264 --> 20:23.265
Okay.

20:24.183 --> 20:25.392
- Is that the one?
- Yeah, yeah.

20:25.392 --> 20:28.854
It's kind of expensive. Is that okay?

20:28.854 --> 20:30.314
- It's cool.
- Yeah.

20:30.314 --> 20:31.607
What else do you need?

20:32.983 --> 20:34.651
Knock yourself out. Come on.

20:40.115 --> 20:42.451
Are you gonna join us
for dinner tomorrow night?

20:43.410 --> 20:44.536
Absolutely not.

20:46.413 --> 20:50.667
What, you don't want to see
Barbara and Mike?

20:51.543 --> 20:52.544
Who?

20:54.796 --> 20:58.258
- GG and Marcus are gonna be there too.
- Yeah.

21:00.761 --> 21:04.348
Yeah, that new boat of theirs
is pretty sweet, huh?

21:14.358 --> 21:18.904
Charlie, what's Blair's last name again?
I'm spacing on it.

21:19.613 --> 21:21.615
- Wait, what?
- Blair. Her last--

21:21.615 --> 21:23.784
I gotta write everybody an email.

21:25.577 --> 21:27.538
Caplan. I think. Thank you.

21:27.538 --> 21:28.622
Caplan.

21:54.022 --> 21:55.023
Can I come in?

21:55.774 --> 21:56.775
Yeah.

21:59.027 --> 22:00.487
Reviewing your work?

22:02.364 --> 22:06.285
This is like forgetting
every single thing about yourself

22:06.285 --> 22:10.539
and then reading your own biography.

22:16.753 --> 22:19.298
So I guess you really don't remember me.

22:21.925 --> 22:23.719
Then I should start over.

22:27.639 --> 22:29.099
Amanda Lucas.

22:33.645 --> 22:34.897
What's your role here?

22:34.897 --> 22:36.732
I'm a psychiatrist.

22:37.441 --> 22:38.817
Just for this lab?

22:39.401 --> 22:41.069
I train the box pilots.

22:41.069 --> 22:43.280
Training? What kind of training?

22:43.280 --> 22:46.200
Mental conditioning
for harsh environments.

22:46.200 --> 22:49.328
Emotional regulation. Hyperfocus.

22:50.162 --> 22:53.040
I oversaw trials for Lavender Fairy,

22:53.624 --> 22:55.292
the drug Ryan built.

22:58.629 --> 23:00.839
So you said that you and I live together.

23:01.924 --> 23:03.217
For over a year.

23:05.677 --> 23:06.678
Off and on.

23:18.482 --> 23:21.652
Listen, that day that I disappeared...

23:24.738 --> 23:26.198
What happened that day?

23:34.206 --> 23:35.415
We...

23:36.792 --> 23:38.377
We woke up that morning,

23:38.961 --> 23:42.130
and I could tell
something was bothering you.

23:44.216 --> 23:47.135
You had seen an ex-girlfriend
the night before.

23:47.845 --> 23:51.640
You said you were fine.
I said I didn't believe you.

23:52.599 --> 23:55.644
I knew you were going to do something.
I just didn't know what.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.359
When I got out of the shower...

24:04.528 --> 24:05.863
you were gone.

24:10.325 --> 24:12.286
I must be out of my mind.

24:15.497 --> 24:18.542
I mean,
what other explanation could there be?

24:21.962 --> 24:27.092
Sometimes an extreme stress situation
can trigger psychogenic amnesia.

24:28.802 --> 24:33.390
Abnormal memory functioning in
the absence of structural brain damage.

24:40.397 --> 24:43.901
What if I'm not the person
that I think I am?

24:46.987 --> 24:50.741
That all these thoughts
are just a-- like you said,

24:50.741 --> 24:53.911
a by-product of the trauma

24:53.911 --> 24:57.789
or brain damage from working here
or being inside the box.

24:59.917 --> 25:04.630
See, these thoughts,
the files, they are-- that's me.

25:04.630 --> 25:07.257
That's-- These clothes. Even these.

25:08.217 --> 25:11.053
They're not mine,
but they might as well be.

25:12.429 --> 25:13.430
So,

25:14.431 --> 25:15.474
what if...

25:17.476 --> 25:21.939
I'm not me? I'm the person that
everybody else thinks that I am.

26:10.070 --> 26:12.406
You greet people when they arrive.
I'm gonna go get changed.

26:13.866 --> 26:14.908
You're on.

26:14.908 --> 26:16.785
- I'm on it.
- I'll be two minutes.

26:18.495 --> 26:21.540
GG and Marcus. Barbara and Mike.

26:24.960 --> 26:25.961
Cheers.

26:26.753 --> 26:27.754
How you been?

26:29.840 --> 26:31.008
No complaints.

26:32.301 --> 26:36.847
But you must love being a lawyer. It's--

26:38.390 --> 26:41.018
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I like being a lawyer.

26:41.018 --> 26:43.937
- What do you-- I mean, it's all right.
- Yeah.

26:44.605 --> 26:46.523
I'm happy to see you.

26:47.191 --> 26:48.233
I'm happy to see you too.

26:48.233 --> 26:49.693
- Yeah, you look great.
- Thank you.

26:49.693 --> 26:51.778
- I'll go just check on everybody. Yeah.
- Of course. Go, go.

26:51.778 --> 26:53.572
Yeah. I'll see you in a minute.

26:53.572 --> 26:55.574
I've always wanted to see Fiji.

26:55.574 --> 26:56.658
- Oh, gosh.
- Always.

26:56.658 --> 26:58.619
I mean, the snorkeling was life-changing.

26:58.619 --> 27:00.245
I'd go back again in a second,
wouldn't you?

27:00.245 --> 27:01.747
Oh, shit. I'd live there.

27:02.414 --> 27:03.415
There you go.

27:03.415 --> 27:04.541
Gotcha.

27:04.541 --> 27:09.046
So Charlie, he's-- Thank you--
Is he still thinking art school?

27:09.046 --> 27:10.339
Last I heard.

27:10.839 --> 27:14.801
And what about Connor?
Is-- How-- He must be a senior now.

27:14.801 --> 27:17.596
Yeah.
Connor's driving us both fucking crazy.

27:18.096 --> 27:21.767
Yeah. He's failing two classes.
I don't think he's gonna get into UFC.

27:21.767 --> 27:23.602
You can imagine how Mike is taking that.

27:23.602 --> 27:24.978
Not so good, huh?

27:27.898 --> 27:28.899
Don't fight it.

27:29.483 --> 27:31.235
- Who's that?
- Just accept it.

27:31.235 --> 27:32.861
- Okay.
- Absorb it. Hey, buddy.

27:34.863 --> 27:35.948
- Hey.
- Hi.

27:37.115 --> 27:39.159
Daniela invited me, so...

27:40.869 --> 27:41.954
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:42.746 --> 27:46.291
- Care for a drink?
- I'm okay right now, but thank you.

27:46.291 --> 27:49.461
Okay, and you probably want a Diet Coke.

27:49.461 --> 27:53.257
I would kill for a Diet Coke. You know me.
Can I have some? Do you have those?

27:55.217 --> 27:58.011
- Hello.
- Hey. Hi. There she is.

27:59.847 --> 28:01.557
My God, it smells good.
What is happening here?

28:01.557 --> 28:05.894
- It is a beef Wellington.
- What?

28:06.812 --> 28:09.815
- Do you need a hand?
- No, I think I'm good. Thank you.

28:09.815 --> 28:10.899
Okay. Sure.

28:15.946 --> 28:17.239
I'm so glad you could come.

28:17.239 --> 28:19.032
- It's really nice to see you.
- So good to see you.

28:19.032 --> 28:21.285
Sorry, I was just in the middle
of a conversation. We'll catch up.

28:21.285 --> 28:23.203
How dare you go have fun
with better people.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.041
Hey.

28:28.750 --> 28:29.751
Hey.

28:30.335 --> 28:31.336
I want to...

28:32.754 --> 28:36.216
apologize again
for overstepping boundaries.

28:36.216 --> 28:37.676
I shouldn't have called Daniela.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.388
No. Forget it.

28:44.016 --> 28:45.100
We're cool?

28:47.019 --> 28:49.354
Yeah. Yeah, we're cool.

28:54.943 --> 28:55.944
What?

28:58.113 --> 28:59.114
You look good.

29:08.916 --> 29:11.126
I hear you've been
going through your old files.

29:13.253 --> 29:14.630
Ringing any bells?

29:16.006 --> 29:17.007
No?

29:18.884 --> 29:19.885
That's too bad.

29:20.469 --> 29:21.720
You know what I think?

29:22.554 --> 29:25.098
I think the reason why you don't
remember anything about your life

29:25.098 --> 29:27.100
is because it wasn't yours to begin with.

29:32.356 --> 29:35.025
We're gonna finish what we started
the night that you returned.

29:35.025 --> 29:36.443
I'm gonna ask you a few questions.

29:36.443 --> 29:38.862
And this time around,
you're gonna tell me the truth.

29:39.404 --> 29:41.365
- I am telling you the truth.
- No.

29:43.367 --> 29:44.826
You told Daniela Vargas the truth.

29:48.330 --> 29:51.083
You told Ryan Holder the truth.

29:59.299 --> 30:00.843
Tell me what you told Ryan.

30:01.635 --> 30:04.096
Tell me what you told this woman
you thought was your wife.

30:06.431 --> 30:07.683
You're an impostor.

30:09.685 --> 30:11.812
Another version of the Jason we love.

30:13.021 --> 30:14.231
Where you from?

30:14.940 --> 30:16.316
And where's our Jason?

30:18.318 --> 30:20.320
How did you use the box
to get to this world?

30:33.876 --> 30:35.961
- So now--
- Yeah, your new place.

30:35.961 --> 30:38.797
I just have to wait
to see if I actually got the place.

30:39.298 --> 30:41.717
- I love Bucktown.
- So do I.

30:41.717 --> 30:44.511
And it's gonna
take 25 minutes off my commute.

30:44.511 --> 30:46.972
Also, it's right by Map Room.

30:46.972 --> 30:49.600
It's the best beer bar
in Chicago. Not even close.

30:49.600 --> 30:51.852
Underground caves that you can swim in.

30:51.852 --> 30:53.478
- Have you heard of this?
- No.

30:53.478 --> 30:55.606
Yeah, it's incredible. Jason.

30:56.481 --> 30:57.774
- Sorry.
- Yeah?

30:58.817 --> 31:01.695
What was the name
of that hotel that we stayed in?

31:04.031 --> 31:05.657
With-- Which--

31:05.657 --> 31:09.620
You remember last Thanksgiving,
we stayed in that hotel.

31:09.620 --> 31:11.705
You were obsessed with it.
What was it called?

31:26.678 --> 31:27.763
Mahekal.

31:27.763 --> 31:31.433
Mahekal, that's it. Mahekal.

31:31.433 --> 31:33.644
It was beautiful. We loved it.

31:42.027 --> 31:43.737
Where's our Jason?

31:44.947 --> 31:47.950
Oh, no. Here we go. Wait for this.

31:48.909 --> 31:50.786
Thank you all for coming.

31:52.412 --> 31:54.122
Where's our Jason?

31:57.251 --> 32:02.464
To my extraordinary wife, Daniela,
who made this amazing meal.

32:06.134 --> 32:08.720
- I do not deserve you.
- That's true.

32:09.346 --> 32:12.432
- Listen, I-- You people.
- Well, it's true.

32:14.935 --> 32:18.772
I would rather spend time
with the people in this room

32:20.023 --> 32:22.234
than the best people in the world.

32:22.234 --> 32:25.612
No. Knew it.

32:33.370 --> 32:35.414
- It's pretty good.
- I love you.

32:35.414 --> 32:37.249
- It was nice.
- Love you too.

32:40.043 --> 32:41.336
Dawn.

32:50.971 --> 32:52.806
Everything I've done, I had to do.

32:56.059 --> 32:57.728
I know I've made mistakes, but...

33:00.272 --> 33:01.857
I never wanted to hurt anyone.

33:08.614 --> 33:10.782
I never wanted any of this to happen.

33:18.040 --> 33:20.667
I have the key to the box
at my fingertips,

33:20.667 --> 33:22.628
and I don't even know how to use it.

33:27.257 --> 33:28.675
It's fucking me up.

33:29.718 --> 33:31.428
Well, I can't help you.

33:32.221 --> 33:33.222
I don't know.

33:34.306 --> 33:36.183
Brother.
You gonna have to do better than that.

33:38.310 --> 33:41.438
Everyone who gets in that box vanishes,
never to be heard from again.

33:42.064 --> 33:43.482
Now, I don't know
what happens in that box.

33:43.482 --> 33:46.276
Could be an experience beyond
my wildest dreams. Could be a nightmare.

33:48.445 --> 33:50.822
Even if you didn't build the box,
a better version of you did,

33:50.822 --> 33:53.116
which means you have
some innate sense of how it works.

33:54.952 --> 33:56.245
Please, Jason.

33:57.204 --> 33:59.081
This is important,
not just to me but to all of us.

34:00.624 --> 34:02.835
- Why? Yeah.
- Why?

34:05.420 --> 34:07.798
What if there was a world
where cancer had been solved, huh?

34:07.798 --> 34:09.550
Or climate change. Poverty.

34:09.550 --> 34:11.385
Social discourse. Hunger.

34:12.052 --> 34:15.097
What if we could bring that knowledge
into our suffering world?

34:15.097 --> 34:17.306
Now, it is all going to shit around here.

34:17.306 --> 34:20.018
So, Jason, I'm only gonna
ask you one more fucking time.

34:20.768 --> 34:23.272
How does it work?

34:26.483 --> 34:28.025
You get in the box.

34:29.485 --> 34:30.904
You close the door.

34:32.906 --> 34:35.826
And you twirl around
and you fucking cross your fingers.

34:35.826 --> 34:37.661
I don't fucking know.

34:45.293 --> 34:46.295
God.

34:52.426 --> 34:53.677
Fuck.

35:39.139 --> 35:40.390
What is this?

35:41.099 --> 35:42.684
You were amazing tonight.

35:48.899 --> 35:50.067
Are you drunk?

35:55.280 --> 35:56.448
Just...

36:04.456 --> 36:05.999
Are you sure you're okay?

36:07.584 --> 36:08.585
Yeah.

36:10.838 --> 36:13.048
Do you promise you would tell me
if you weren't?

36:14.883 --> 36:18.679
'Cause past few days have been different.

36:19.555 --> 36:20.806
They've been great.

36:23.100 --> 36:24.518
They've been different.

36:35.696 --> 36:36.864
No. Fuck.

36:37.531 --> 36:39.700
Hey, no! Fuck!

36:40.200 --> 36:43.912
- Ryan! Help me!
- Hey.

36:43.912 --> 36:49.126
Come here. Buddy. Oh, God.

36:49.126 --> 36:53.046
Come here. Oh, my God.
What is happening, man?

36:53.046 --> 36:56.508
I'm so sorry. I think it's my fault.

36:56.508 --> 37:00.387
Leighton was reaching out to me, and I
called him back after Daniela's thing.

37:00.888 --> 37:01.722
That's--

37:02.472 --> 37:06.685
- That's how they knew how to find me.
- I'm so sorry. I didn't know.

37:06.685 --> 37:08.896
I don't know.
I don't know what's happening.

37:12.191 --> 37:13.567
- Ryan.
- Hey.

37:14.776 --> 37:16.570
- Ryan.
- What?

37:17.112 --> 37:18.322
They killed Daniela.

37:19.615 --> 37:20.616
What?

37:21.200 --> 37:22.743
They just broke into the apartment.

37:23.660 --> 37:27.080
And they just shot her
right in front of me.

37:28.332 --> 37:31.543
She's gone. She--

37:32.503 --> 37:33.670
'Cause I called.

37:34.254 --> 37:36.048
- This is my fault. This--
- No. No, no.

37:36.048 --> 37:38.008
- This is my fault. My fault.
- Listen.

37:39.885 --> 37:41.178
Oh, shit.

37:42.137 --> 37:46.058
It's not your fault, okay? It's my fault.

37:46.058 --> 37:47.935
It's my fault. I just--

37:49.269 --> 37:50.854
I shouldn't have gone there.

37:51.813 --> 37:53.190
Brother, you gotta tell me.

37:53.190 --> 37:55.817
What was it that you were
working on at Velocity?

37:57.694 --> 37:59.655
You're the missing piece, Ryan.

37:59.655 --> 38:02.032
- I just need you to tell me what it was--
- You--

38:02.032 --> 38:04.701
You asked me to build a drug

38:05.285 --> 38:08.455
that would alter the brain chemistry
of the prefrontal cortex.

38:08.455 --> 38:09.456
- Alter it?
- Yeah.

38:09.456 --> 38:10.791
- How?
- To put--

38:10.791 --> 38:14.253
To put certain areas of it asleep
for an hour.

38:14.253 --> 38:16.046
Why? What was the application?

38:16.046 --> 38:17.297
You wouldn't tell me!

38:17.297 --> 38:20.467
Jason, I was throwing darts in the dark,

38:20.467 --> 38:23.053
and you would just tell me if
I fucking came close to the bull's-eye.

38:23.053 --> 38:25.806
I'm not who you think I am.

38:26.723 --> 38:30.519
They were trying to put
a human being in superposition.

38:32.479 --> 38:35.023
Theoretically, it's impossible, okay?

38:35.023 --> 38:38.318
Because the consciousness
just wouldn't allow it.

38:40.362 --> 38:44.992
Ryan, we'd be making observations
that would cause everything to decohere.

38:44.992 --> 38:46.910
But if there was a--

38:47.619 --> 38:51.248
if there was a mechanism in the brain
responsible for it.

38:51.248 --> 38:53.333
- The observer effect.
- ...effect.

38:53.834 --> 38:57.880
That's what it is. My drug stops the brain
from causing its own decoherence.

38:58.672 --> 38:59.756
That's what it is.

39:00.966 --> 39:02.259
That is what it is.

39:02.759 --> 39:08.265
Okay, but it wouldn't stop others
from decohering us if they observe us.

39:11.935 --> 39:13.562
That's where the box comes in.

39:13.562 --> 39:15.814
What? What box?
What are you talking about?

39:15.814 --> 39:16.899
The box!

39:17.524 --> 39:19.735
Inside the room, there's a hangar.

39:19.735 --> 39:24.531
- They have a box, and that is a gateway.
- You--

39:28.577 --> 39:29.578
Ryan,

39:31.121 --> 39:32.456
would you come with us, please?

39:42.049 --> 39:43.091
You know...

39:44.092 --> 39:48.430
how I came home late
from Ryan's party the other night?

39:48.430 --> 39:49.515
Yeah.

39:51.808 --> 39:56.104
When I left the bar,
my head was somewhere else.

39:56.772 --> 39:59.149
<i>I was thinking about Ryan's job offer.</i>

40:00.150 --> 40:04.196
<i>And I was feeling down,
and I just stepped into the traffic.</i>

40:12.412 --> 40:15.290
<i>And a cab nearly splattered me
across the pavement.</i>

40:18.710 --> 40:23.382
And I don't know if it was because
my life flashed before my eyes,

40:25.175 --> 40:30.055
but ever since that moment,
I've felt so alive.

40:31.932 --> 40:37.062
Like I finally see my life
with force and clarity.

40:37.980 --> 40:41.108
And all the things
that I really should be grateful for.

40:42.693 --> 40:44.862
You. You, especially.

40:46.655 --> 40:52.286
I realized that I've just been so afraid
to live my life the way that I want to.

40:54.371 --> 40:56.206
And I'm not gonna do that anymore.

41:12.681 --> 41:16.185
You need to come with me right now.
I'm getting you out of here.

41:16.185 --> 41:17.895
What? The cameras.

41:17.895 --> 41:19.354
I turned them off. Let's go.

41:20.689 --> 41:23.108
Hey, what about Ryan?

41:24.943 --> 41:25.944
I'm sorry.

41:28.530 --> 41:29.615
We have to go.

41:58.310 --> 42:02.439
Hey, why are you helping me?

42:05.317 --> 42:08.195
I don't know that I can
come back from what I've been a part of,

42:09.655 --> 42:11.156
but I have to try.

42:16.453 --> 42:17.454
Stay there.

42:20.749 --> 42:21.750
Come on.

42:26.296 --> 42:27.714
What happens now?

42:27.714 --> 42:29.800
We just have to get through
the night watchman.

42:29.800 --> 42:32.970
This elevator is the only way out.
Let's go.

42:32.970 --> 42:34.054
Fuck!

42:37.474 --> 42:38.767
Dawn!

42:43.856 --> 42:44.940
What do we do?

42:46.233 --> 42:48.777
I'm thinking. Shit.

42:50.779 --> 42:52.197
Can we get out?

42:55.158 --> 42:55.993
Fuck.

42:58.954 --> 42:59.997
The box.

43:00.497 --> 43:01.874
What? The box?

43:05.085 --> 43:06.670
- <i>Name, please.</i>
- Amanda Lucas.

43:06.670 --> 43:08.422
<i>Please enter passcode.</i>

43:08.922 --> 43:10.549
- <i>Access denied.</i>
- Shit.

43:11.133 --> 43:13.886
- <i>Name, please.</i>
- Amanda Lucas.

43:13.886 --> 43:15.512
<i>Access denied.</i>

43:15.512 --> 43:16.889
They've frozen my clearance.

43:17.848 --> 43:18.849
Hey, wait.

43:23.270 --> 43:24.521
<i>Name, please.</i>

43:25.606 --> 43:28.233
- Jason Dessen.
- <i>Please enter passcode.</i>

43:30.819 --> 43:31.820
Come on.

43:32.404 --> 43:33.739
<i>Access granted.</i>

43:38.827 --> 43:40.037
Jason, stop!

43:41.205 --> 43:42.206
Get in the box.

43:45.459 --> 43:47.294
Amanda, no!

43:49.171 --> 43:50.047
Go!

43:51.089 --> 43:52.132
Come on.

44:00.390 --> 44:01.391
Come on.

44:06.480 --> 44:08.315
Can anyone get through?

44:08.315 --> 44:11.985
I don't think so. It's supposed
to stay locked for three minutes.

44:11.985 --> 44:13.070
Set a timer.

44:13.570 --> 44:16.573
And then what?

44:18.575 --> 44:19.952
We better not be here.

44:20.827 --> 44:22.079
We?

44:23.664 --> 44:25.123
You can't come with me.

44:25.123 --> 44:26.333
They just shot at us.

44:26.333 --> 44:28.961
Just tell them that I made you.
That I forced you to. That--

44:28.961 --> 44:32.214
It won't make a difference.
Leighton doesn't forgive.

44:37.845 --> 44:38.929
- Oh, God.
- We're supposed

44:38.929 --> 44:40.764
to inject ourselves with one of these.

44:40.764 --> 44:43.433
Roll up your sleeve. Put this on.

44:50.274 --> 44:51.275
Okay, great.

44:51.817 --> 44:53.777
I need to hit your antecubital, okay?

44:54.319 --> 44:56.113
When I'm over the vein,
it's gonna turn green.

44:56.113 --> 44:57.447
- Yeah.
- Okay?

44:57.447 --> 44:58.532
What is it?

44:59.825 --> 45:01.368
Sorry. Are you okay?

45:14.464 --> 45:18.427
I don't know how to work the-- the box.

45:18.427 --> 45:19.928
That makes two of us.

45:23.140 --> 45:26.852
I need to get back to my family.

45:34.443 --> 45:35.444
- Hi.
- No.

45:35.444 --> 45:37.696
- I'm gonna do it.
- No. You're declaring--

45:37.696 --> 45:39.156
- Yeah.
- But you're not--

45:39.656 --> 45:42.367
I am a super-sleuth detective

45:42.367 --> 45:44.036
- and I'm doing it.
- He's not.

45:44.036 --> 45:46.330
Am I doing-- Yes, I'm doing it. Okay, so...

45:48.373 --> 45:49.499
- Miss Scarlet--
- No.

45:50.083 --> 45:51.502
- In the study, obviously...
- No.

45:51.502 --> 45:54.588
<i>...with the knife. Don't believe me?</i>

45:54.588 --> 45:59.510
<i>Just read 'em and weep, birthday boy!
Read 'em and weep, Charlie.</i>

45:59.510 --> 46:00.844
<i>That's right. Ready?</i>

46:07.768 --> 46:11.522
- <i>Damn it! No!</i>
- <i>Always! Every time!</i>

46:11.522 --> 46:12.606
<i>Goddamn it.</i>
