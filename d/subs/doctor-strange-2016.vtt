17:07.080 --> 17:09.720
No, now is exactly the time not to stop...

17:09.920 --> 17:12.600
because, you see,
I'm not getting any better!

There are other things that
can give your life meaning.

17:26.240 --> 17:27.880
Like what? Like you?

17:30.320 --> 17:32.600
This is the part where you apologize.

17:32.880 --> 17:34.600
This is the part where you leave.

17:35.840 --> 17:38.160
Fine, I can't watch you
do this to yourself anymore.

17:38.440 --> 17:39.440
Oh, too difficult for you, is it?

17:39.920 --> 17:41.800
Yes, it is.

17:41.960 --> 17:44.160
It breaks my heart to see you this way.

17:44.400 --> 17:46.400
-No, don't pity me.
-I'm not pitying you.

17:46.720 --> 17:47.720
Oh, yeah?
Then what are you doing here...

17:47.920 --> 17:50.080

We are not friends, Christine.

17:51.720 --> 17:52.920
We were barely lovers.

I do know you.

19:35.960 --> 19:38.680
I came to your office once.
You refused to see me.

I never got past your assistant.

I thought my mind's
the only thing I have left...

20:17.240 --> 20:19.160
I should at least try to elevate that.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.760

20:21.920 --> 20:23.600
and sacred women.

mountaintops to see holy men.

20:26.760 --> 20:27.800
And finally...

20:28.080 --> 20:30.600
I found my teacher.

20:30.760 --> 20:33.280
And my mind was elevated...

20:33.440 --> 20:34.640
and my spirit deepened.

32:17.160 --> 32:19.320
He reminds you of Kaecilius?

I cannot lead another
gifted student to power...

32:22.320 --> 32:24.560
only to lose him to the darkness.

32:26.520 --> 32:28.000
You didn't lose me.

32:28.840 --> 32:30.720
I wanted the power
to defeat my enemies.

32:30.800 --> 32:34.400
You gave me the power
to defeat my demons.

32:34.560 --> 32:37.440
And to live within the natural law.

32:37.720 --> 32:40.760

The sorcerers of antiquity...

34:32.440 --> 34:35.280
called the use of this language "spells."

That's a question.

47:18.560 --> 47:19.640
(DOCTOR STRANGE CHUCKLES)

47:20.240 --> 47:22.040
This is a relic.

47:22.200 --> 47:24.040
Some magic is too powerful to sustain...

47:24.200 --> 47:25.200
so we imbue objects with it...

47:26.520 --> 47:28.720
allowing them
to take the strain we cannot.

47:28.920 --> 47:31.760
This is the staff...

47:31.960 --> 47:33.560
of the Living Tribunal.

47:37.360 --> 47:38.480
There are many relics.

47:39.240 --> 47:40.400
The Wand of Watoomb.

47:40.720 --> 47:43.080
The Vaulting Boots of Valtorr.

the tongue, don't they?

47:46.040 --> 47:47.760
-When do I get my relic?
-When you're ready.

47:48.240 --> 47:49.280
I think I'm ready.

47:49.520 --> 47:52.080
You're ready when the relic
decides you're ready.

47:52.800 --> 47:54.040
For now...

47:55.040 --> 47:56.040
conjure a weapon.

Tampering with continuum probabilities

I was just doing
exactly what it said in the book.

51:34.240 --> 51:35.400
What did the book say

51:35.480 --> 51:36.800
about the dangers
of performing that ritual?

51:37.040 --> 51:38.640
I don't know.
I hadn't gotten to that part yet.

51:38.720 --> 51:41.720
Temporal manipulations
can create branches in time.

51:41.880 --> 51:44.160
Unstable dimensional openings.

51:44.320 --> 51:46.520
Spatial paradoxes! Time loops!

51:46.680 --> 51:48.640
You wanna get stuck
reliving the same moment

51:48.960 --> 51:50.040
over and over forever...

51:50.120 --> 51:51.440
or never having existed at all?

51:52.880 --> 51:55.120
Really should put the warnings
before the spell.

51:55.200 --> 51:57.160
Your curiosity could have
gotten you killed.

51:57.440 --> 51:59.560
You weren't manipulating
the space-time continuum...

51:59.680 --> 52:00.640
you were breaking it.

52:02.080 --> 52:04.040
We do not tamper with natural law.

52:04.120 --> 52:05.120
We defend it.

52:05.360 --> 52:06.680
How did you even do that?

52:07.000 --> 52:08.040
Hmm?

52:08.320 --> 52:11.200
Where did you learn the litany of spells
required to even understand it?

52:11.480 --> 52:12.480
I've got a photographic memory.

52:12.560 --> 52:14.320
That's how I got my M.D.
and Ph.D. at the same time.

52:14.640 --> 52:16.000
What you just did...

52:16.800 --> 52:18.480
takes more than a good memory.

52:18.760 --> 52:20.480
You were born for the mystic arts.

52:20.560 --> 52:22.720
And yet my hands still shake.

52:22.960 --> 52:24.080
For now, yes.

we sorcerers safeguard it
against more mystical threats.

to the father of the mystic arts...

52:50.360 --> 52:51.560
the mighty Agamotto.

52:52.600 --> 52:56.680
Same sorcerer who created the eye
you so recklessly borrowed.

52:58.160 --> 53:01.680
Agamotto built three Sanctums
in places of power...

53:01.760 --> 53:03.840
where great cities now stand.

53:03.920 --> 53:06.080
That door leads to
the Hong Kong Sanctum.

53:06.840 --> 53:08.720
That door to the New York Sanctum.

That one to the London Sanctum.

53:11.560 --> 53:12.800
Together...

53:13.080 --> 53:16.520

a protective shield around our world.

protect the world...

protect the Sanctums.

53:22.280 --> 53:24.160
From what?

53:24.400 --> 53:26.960
Other dimensional beings
that threaten our universe.

53:27.680 --> 53:28.760
Like Dormammu.

53:30.360 --> 53:31.680
Where did you learn that name?

53:32.360 --> 53:35.560
I just read it in
The Book of Cagliostro. Why?

53:40.760 --> 53:43.320

in the Dark Dimension.

53:44.480 --> 53:45.480
Beyond time.

53:46.280 --> 53:48.280
He is the cosmic conqueror...

53:48.400 --> 53:50.320
the destroyer of worlds.

53:50.760 --> 53:54.160
A being of infinite power
and endless hunger...

53:54.240 --> 53:56.640
on a quest to invade every universe...

53:56.720 --> 53:59.440
and bring all worlds
into his Dark Dimension.

54:00.880 --> 54:03.280
And he hungers for Earth most of all.

54:04.800 --> 54:06.640
The pages that Kaecilius stole.

54:07.160 --> 54:09.240
A ritual to contact Dormammu

and draw power
from the Dark Dimension.

The real magic she keeps for herself.

1:04:12.520 --> 1:04:15.840
You ever wonder
how she managed to live this long?

1:04:23.720 --> 1:04:25.960
So, you know.

1:04:26.280 --> 1:04:27.880
The ritual gives me the power

1:04:27.960 --> 1:04:29.280
to overthrow The Ancient One...

1:04:29.360 --> 1:04:31.120
and tear her Sanctums down.

1:04:31.200 --> 1:04:33.840
To let the Dark Dimension in.

1:04:33.920 --> 1:04:35.960
Because what The Ancient One hoards,

1:04:36.240 --> 1:04:37.680
Dormammu gives freely.

No, and I don't want to know.

1:16:00.880 --> 1:16:01.920
You're a coward.

1:16:02.320 --> 1:16:03.360
Because I'm not a killer?

1:16:03.600 --> 1:16:05.120
These Zealots will snuff us all out...

1:16:05.200 --> 1:16:07.760
and you can't muster the strength
to snuff them first?

1:16:07.920 --> 1:16:09.280
(SHOUTS) What do you think I just did?

1:16:09.440 --> 1:16:10.680
You saved your own life!

1:16:12.080 --> 1:16:14.600
And then whined about it
like a wounded dog.

1:16:14.840 --> 1:16:16.080
Oh, you would have done it so easily?

1:16:16.280 --> 1:16:18.960
You've no idea the things I've done.

1:16:21.160 --> 1:16:23.040
And the answer is yes.

1:16:23.120 --> 1:16:24.840
Without hesitation.

1:16:25.080 --> 1:16:26.160
Even if there's another way?

1:16:26.360 --> 1:16:28.160
There is no other way.

1:16:28.280 --> 1:16:29.640
You lack imagination.

1:16:29.720 --> 1:16:30.800
No, Stephen.

He's gone.

and surrendered to his power.

1:36:43.800 --> 1:36:46.040
You've come to die.

No. This is real.

You've... What is happening?

1:37:57.760 --> 1:38:00.560
Just as you gave Kaecilius
powers from your dimension...

1:38:00.640 --> 1:38:03.120
I brought a little power from mine.

1:38:03.520 --> 1:38:05.640
This is time.

You cannot do this forever.

1:38:21.280 --> 1:38:22.800
Actually, I can.

1:38:23.120 --> 1:38:25.440
This is how things are now.

1:38:28.720 --> 1:38:29.840
endlessly.

Then you will spend eternity dying.

1:38:33.960 --> 1:38:37.960
Yes. But everyone on Earth will live.

1:38:38.120 --> 1:38:39.720
But you will suffer.
