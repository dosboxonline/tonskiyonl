WEBVTT

00:04.838 --> 00:06.673
<i>Previously on Debris...</i>

00:06.715 --> 00:09.801
I’m going to miss you
when you’re gone, Bryan.

00:11.302 --> 00:13.346
BRYAN:
Cease fire! Cease fire!

00:13.388 --> 00:15.598
FINOLA:
I know about Asalah.

00:15.640 --> 00:17.308
(cries out)

00:17.350 --> 00:19.602
MADDOX: I don’t know
why this happened to you.

00:19.644 --> 00:22.397
I just know that I don’t
want it to happen again.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.357
-(buzzer sounds)
-GEORGE: INFLUX.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.359
They are actively seeking

00:26.401 --> 00:28.820
a very dangerous piece
of Debris.

00:28.862 --> 00:32.157
They believed that I was
the only one that can find it.

00:32.198 --> 00:33.450
BRYAN:
What does it do?

00:33.491 --> 00:36.202
GEORGE:
I don’t quite remember.

00:36.244 --> 00:38.371
Ferris just sent me
the Laghari files.

00:38.413 --> 00:40.623
BRYAN:
That memory.

00:40.665 --> 00:42.042
Why?

00:42.083 --> 00:45.337
FINOLA:
I think all the Debris
may be connected.

00:45.378 --> 00:47.797
They chose you for a reason.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.718
-(device beeps)
-KELSO: No.

00:51.760 --> 00:53.219
-(beep)
-No.

00:53.261 --> 00:55.430
-(beep)
-No.

00:55.472 --> 00:58.141
-(beep)
-Twenty-four... Hang on.

00:58.183 --> 01:02.145
Uh, four-five, two-twenty-two.

01:02.187 --> 01:03.688
And that was it.

01:03.730 --> 01:05.565
Oh, man,
I’m losing my mind here.

01:05.607 --> 01:09.319
Uh, give me a call back
when you get the  authorization.

01:09.361 --> 01:12.113
(phone beeps)

01:12.155 --> 01:13.490
(clattering in distance)

01:25.126 --> 01:28.922
What the heck are you...

01:28.963 --> 01:31.675
doing over here?

01:41.685 --> 01:43.269
(device whirring)

01:51.945 --> 01:54.656
(alarm sounding)

01:54.698 --> 01:57.492
Kelso! Kelso!

02:00.286 --> 02:02.205
(alarm continues)

02:08.461 --> 02:10.672
(plastic clattering)

02:15.969 --> 02:17.470
(powering down)

02:20.682 --> 02:22.517
* (theme)

03:08.855 --> 03:11.941
(crows cawing)

03:11.983 --> 03:13.943
Yes, yes, I come in peace.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.085
(door opens)

03:30.126 --> 03:32.754
(George coughing)

03:41.179 --> 03:42.931
-(switch clicks)
-(beep)

03:42.972 --> 03:45.600
(generator powering up)

03:52.315 --> 03:55.235
(typing)

03:55.276 --> 03:56.861
(computer beeps)

03:59.864 --> 04:01.866
(horn honks in distance)

04:08.790 --> 04:10.917
-BRYAN: Hey, George.
-FINOLA: Hey, Dad.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.420
GEORGE:
Hey.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.716
What is this place?

04:17.757 --> 04:20.427
GEORGE: It was used
to transmit news reports

04:20.468 --> 04:23.596
to the Allied nations
during World War Two.

04:23.638 --> 04:26.016
-BRYAN: Voice of America?
-GEORGE: Yes, yes.

04:26.057 --> 04:29.769
And also shortwave radio
communication with spies,

04:29.811 --> 04:34.566
and now its signal boosting
capabilities or servers, well--

04:34.607 --> 04:37.444
Dad, I got you some new clothes.

04:37.485 --> 04:39.821
Oh, I don’t need them.

04:39.863 --> 04:43.283
It’s, uh, more for us, really.

04:43.324 --> 04:46.161
Oh, well, um, is that for me?

04:46.202 --> 04:47.912
Yes.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.290
-Laghari’s files are on here.
-Complete?

04:50.331 --> 04:53.043
Yeah. That’s what Ferris said.

04:53.084 --> 04:55.545
That’s a lot on there.
It’s gonna take you
a while to get through--

04:55.587 --> 04:58.340
No, no, no.
I know what I need.

04:58.381 --> 05:00.508
These boxes need to go inside,
George?

05:00.550 --> 05:04.179
Yes. Yes, please.
I need them all.

05:04.220 --> 05:07.807
Driving across the country
by yourself wasn’t
the smartest thing to do.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.476
There are people looking
for you.

05:09.517 --> 05:11.478
I know, I know.

05:11.519 --> 05:14.898
I’m perfectly capable
of protecting myself.

05:14.939 --> 05:19.652
-Besides, I had to.
-Why?

05:19.694 --> 05:22.655
It came to me at Garcia’s.

05:22.697 --> 05:24.240
I remember what it does,

05:24.282 --> 05:26.534
the piece
that we’re looking for.

05:26.576 --> 05:30.914
See, INFLUX believes that
it can create a kind of map,

05:30.955 --> 05:33.333
showing the location
of all the Debris,

05:33.375 --> 05:37.379
every piece
on the face of the earth.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.464
This is what
I’ve been telling you.

05:39.506 --> 05:42.300
The race for Debris
and the power that it holds,

05:42.342 --> 05:43.843
and it could end here,

05:43.885 --> 05:45.679
if INFLUX gets this piece first.

05:45.720 --> 05:49.391
It’s a good thing I know
what I’m talking about, hmm?

05:51.101 --> 05:53.812
What I’m going to do is hack
into the satellites

05:53.853 --> 05:57.774
operated by the European Space
Agency’s so-called Swarm--

05:57.816 --> 05:59.859
the Earth Observation System--

05:59.901 --> 06:03.488
and reconfigure them
to collect the data I need.

06:03.530 --> 06:07.742
See, the piece of Debris
that we’re looking for could
be anywhere in North America,

06:07.784 --> 06:11.037
but I need to acquire the
high-altitude satellite data,

06:11.079 --> 06:13.039
if I have any chance
of finding it.

06:13.081 --> 06:16.543
FINOLA:
And can the Swarm
satellites even detect it?

06:16.584 --> 06:19.796
When INFLUX was forcing me
to make the scanner,

06:19.838 --> 06:22.841
they told me that the signal
they’re looking for

06:22.882 --> 06:26.219
is as a result
of a unique interaction

06:26.261 --> 06:29.597
between the piece
and, uh, magnetic fields,

06:29.639 --> 06:32.767
and that Swarm can detect.

06:32.809 --> 06:35.311
So if you recalibrate
the Swarm,

06:35.353 --> 06:37.939
then you can find the anomalies
in the Earth’s magnetic field?

06:37.981 --> 06:39.107
Exactly.

06:39.149 --> 06:42.110
I’m following you, George.

06:42.152 --> 06:44.738
So then why are Dr. Laghari’s
files important?

06:44.779 --> 06:46.698
They’re a road map for me,
you see.

06:46.740 --> 06:50.076
Before I brought
Dr. Laghari into Orbital,

06:50.118 --> 06:52.579
he spent years working
on calculations

06:52.620 --> 06:56.249
to interpret magnetic
field data.

06:56.291 --> 07:01.004
Mathematical calculations
that I can’t remember.

07:01.046 --> 07:03.340
But with this, I’ll be able
to determine exactly

07:03.381 --> 07:07.093
where the piece will warp
the magnetic field.

07:11.598 --> 07:14.184
I’m going to get
the rest of the boxes.

07:14.225 --> 07:16.186
I’ll be back in a minute.

07:16.227 --> 07:19.105
(typing)

07:19.147 --> 07:21.608
(computer beeping)

07:21.649 --> 07:25.695
Dad, I think it’s really great
that you’re remembering well
now.

07:25.737 --> 07:29.115
I just need to know
when you remember.

07:29.157 --> 07:33.536
We need to know if you remember
why Maddox wants you dead.

07:35.205 --> 07:39.959
Well, I have been thinking
about that, and...

07:40.001 --> 07:44.130
maybe it’s because he fears
what he can’t control.

07:44.172 --> 07:46.466
What do you mean,
he fears what he can’t control?

07:46.508 --> 07:51.096
He works for government.
That’s what governments do.

07:51.137 --> 07:55.016
Even our own,
the subjugation of India,

07:55.058 --> 07:57.936
the colonization, I mean,
right here in the U.S.,

07:57.977 --> 08:00.605
the massacre at Wounded Knee,

08:00.647 --> 08:02.315
the Japanese internment camps.

08:02.357 --> 08:05.527
I mean, do I need to go on?

08:05.568 --> 08:10.740
Governments are created
to serve the public interest.

08:10.782 --> 08:15.495
And everywhere, inevitably,
they serve their own,

08:15.537 --> 08:19.499
and people are left to suffer.

08:19.541 --> 08:20.917
Please, sweetheart,

08:20.959 --> 08:25.547
be careful with this
so-called coalition.

08:26.881 --> 08:27.841
I know.

08:30.635 --> 08:35.015
I believe in Bryan,
but Orbital...

08:35.056 --> 08:37.392
doesn’t feel like
a coalition at all.

08:37.434 --> 08:40.020
(chuckles)
Smart girl.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.187
(chuckles)

08:41.229 --> 08:43.898
-(door opens)
-Hey, we got to go.

08:43.940 --> 08:45.859
-What’s wrong?
-Tom called.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.319
There’s been a Debris incident
back at Orbital.

09:00.457 --> 09:03.376
Lost power, and the entire
facility had to be evacuated.

09:03.418 --> 09:06.546
There’s still eight technicians
unaccounted for in the hangar
area.

09:06.588 --> 09:09.090
-How many pieces are affected?
-We don’t know yet.

09:09.132 --> 09:12.969
Got CCTV of what happened
before the alarms went off.

09:13.011 --> 09:14.346
Debris went right
through the wall,

09:14.387 --> 09:16.139
connected with the ship.

09:16.181 --> 09:17.932
-That wall’s
the lockup warehouse?
-TOM: Yeah.

09:17.974 --> 09:19.893
So the power went down
soon afterward,

09:19.934 --> 09:21.686
so all the footage we tried
getting from there is black.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.355
Any theories?

09:23.396 --> 09:25.857
MADDOX:
We think INFLUX is doing
something with Debris.

09:25.899 --> 09:29.069
If what you suggest is true,
that the Debris is all
connected,

09:29.110 --> 09:31.529
then whatever they’re doing
could have triggered this

09:31.571 --> 09:33.490
from literally anywhere
on earth.

09:33.531 --> 09:34.616
Has anyone been inside?

09:34.657 --> 09:36.993
Chin has a team standing by.

09:37.035 --> 09:38.912
BRYAN:
Let’s suit up.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.750
<i>CHIN:</i>
<i>Chin for Bryan, come in.</i>

09:43.792 --> 09:45.752
<i>BRYAN:</i>
<i>Go for Bryan.</i>

09:45.794 --> 09:48.254
<i>CHIN:</i>
<i>Be advised Corridor C is clear.</i>

09:48.296 --> 09:50.924
<i>BRYAN:</i>
<i>Copy that. We’re entering</i>
<i>Corridor D, over.</i>

10:05.271 --> 10:07.941
BRYAN:
Hey.

10:07.982 --> 10:10.360
Looks like they’re in some
sort of trance-like state.

10:10.402 --> 10:14.322
Base Camp, we’ve located five
of the missing techs. Stand by.

10:16.991 --> 10:22.163
(device scanning)

10:22.205 --> 10:24.582
BRYAN:
Clocking in at a 230.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.876
Yeah.

10:26.918 --> 10:28.044
(slamming in distance)

10:37.595 --> 10:39.347
BRYAN:
Let’s spread out.

10:53.528 --> 10:56.781
BRYAN:
Got one deceased male,
massive head trauma.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.291
FINOLA:
Straight through.

11:06.332 --> 11:08.460
CHIN:
Bryan, we’ve got something.

11:16.343 --> 11:18.678
-Hey, check this out.
-BRYAN: Huh.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.973
FINOLA:
Bryan, what’s this?

11:29.022 --> 11:33.193
BRYAN:
Hey, what are you guys doing?

11:35.111 --> 11:37.030
Hold on a second.
Hey, hold on a second.

11:37.072 --> 11:38.948
What were you doing?
Do you know where you are?

11:38.990 --> 11:42.869
Zimmer?
Zimmer, can you hear me?

11:42.911 --> 11:45.997
Hello? What were you doing here?

11:47.832 --> 11:50.460
-They’re all under
the same influence.
-FINOLA: Yeah.

11:50.502 --> 11:52.420
Let’s get them with the others,
keep them out of here.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.547
We’re gonna move you out
of here. Do you understand?

11:54.589 --> 11:57.217
MAN:
Got it.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.469
FINOLA:
Bryan, look at this.

12:03.890 --> 12:07.227
The cases, they’re all crushed.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.896
BRYAN:
Well, where’s the Debris
that was in them?

12:26.287 --> 12:28.415
Whoa.

12:28.456 --> 12:31.042
-What happened?
-Careful! Careful.

12:31.084 --> 12:32.460
Stay on the other side.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.296
It looks like it just passed
through

12:35.338 --> 12:39.092
some sort of invisible pocket
right here.

12:39.134 --> 12:41.511
The Debris is being ripped out

12:41.553 --> 12:45.140
as it passes through
from the inside
and then spat out over here.

12:45.181 --> 12:47.892
FINOLA:
Is that why
they’re lining them up

12:47.934 --> 12:49.853
and putting them there?

12:49.894 --> 12:52.355
They’re selecting Debris
for a reason.

13:01.823 --> 13:04.200
Hold on.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.744
Remember what we saw in Ohio.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.955
Entire dimensions can exist
within a 2-D square.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.665
But these are passing
through it.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.543
But without the Debris.

13:13.585 --> 13:14.586
Where’d it go?

13:24.220 --> 13:26.556
(chatter, indistinct)

13:30.727 --> 13:33.855
-MADDOX: Any changes?
-BRYAN: So far they’re
unresponsive.

13:33.897 --> 13:35.732
Where’s the Debris going?

13:35.774 --> 13:38.485
We think it’s some sort of
pocket dimension.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.570
Is it connected to what happened
in the hangar?

13:40.612 --> 13:43.031
-You think that’s what
initiated it?
-It was first.

13:43.073 --> 13:44.949
The situation team
is setting up the N-U’s

13:44.991 --> 13:47.911
to try and stop everything
from progressing any further.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.245
How’s Zimmer doing?

13:49.287 --> 13:51.081
MEDIC:
Temp is 98.2.

13:51.122 --> 13:52.457
Pulse 82, normal.

14:04.636 --> 14:09.766
Whoa. There is a strong
gravitational pull coming
from inside.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.851
What do you think is happening?

14:11.893 --> 14:13.436
I don’t know.

14:13.478 --> 14:15.438
The Debris pieces
aren’t going anywhere.

14:15.480 --> 14:18.608
It’s possible they’re being
contained inside the Seam.

14:18.650 --> 14:23.279
It’s large enough to create
a detectable gravitational pull.

14:23.321 --> 14:25.615
CHIN:
It seems to be taking
one piece at a time.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.743
-Is it assembling it something?
-I don’t know.

14:28.785 --> 14:32.163
CHIN:
Well, let’s hope the N-U’s will
neutralize whatever’s in there.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.790
-Dialed in.
-All right.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.000
Let’s shut it down, guys.

14:47.178 --> 14:49.472
-FINOLA: It’s not working.
-CHIN: Trying to recalibrate.

14:49.514 --> 14:50.974
(groaning)

14:51.016 --> 14:53.184
It’s okay, lay back.

14:54.644 --> 14:56.813
Hey, what’s happening?
Calm down.

14:56.855 --> 14:59.149
MEDIC: He’s tachycardic.
He could stroke out
or have an MI.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.358
-Calm down. Why?
-I don’t know!

15:00.400 --> 15:02.152
-Why? Hey!
-I don’t know!

15:02.193 --> 15:04.487
I’ve dumped 15 CCs of sedative
into him, and it’s done nothing.

15:04.529 --> 15:05.780
BRYAN:
Breathe right now.
I need you to relax.

15:05.822 --> 15:07.657
Bryan! Bryan!

15:07.699 --> 15:09.576
-Zimmer!
-Bryan!

15:09.617 --> 15:11.244
Hey, hey, hey!

15:11.286 --> 15:13.621
Hold him, hold him,
hold him, hey.

15:18.209 --> 15:20.128
Let him go, let him go,
let him go.

15:23.423 --> 15:26.092
Let them go.
Let them go.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.388
Go with him, go with him.

15:53.370 --> 15:55.205
-What?
-CHIN: Maybe there’s too
many different pieces.

15:55.246 --> 15:57.874
With all the different
signatures in there,
it can’t zero in.

15:57.916 --> 16:00.001
That’s a really good idea.

16:00.043 --> 16:02.754
Mark, I need you to inventory
all the empty cases.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.465
I want to know which pieces
are being pulled into the Seam,

16:05.507 --> 16:07.467
and then we can crosscheck
with the case report.

16:07.509 --> 16:09.552
And that way, we can figure out
if there’s anything that might
connect them.

16:09.594 --> 16:11.471
-That does sound about right.
-Careful.

16:16.768 --> 16:17.727
FINOLA:
Bryan.

16:19.771 --> 16:22.023
Bryan, what are you doing?

16:22.065 --> 16:24.109
I need your help. Come on.

16:37.622 --> 16:41.376
Let’s secure this room.
Lock the doors.

16:43.878 --> 16:48.049
They must be bound by proximity
to this thing somehow.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.176
-Yeah. Makes no sense.
-No.

16:50.218 --> 16:54.514
Hey, the N-U’s,
they didn’t work.

16:56.599 --> 16:59.102
I’m gonna go check the ship.

16:59.144 --> 17:00.311
Okay.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.151
(computer beeps)

17:06.192 --> 17:07.902
(tapping)

17:07.944 --> 17:09.070
(beeps)

17:09.112 --> 17:10.321
GEORGE:
Oh, come on.

17:35.972 --> 17:37.265
Hello.

17:53.865 --> 17:56.284
-CHIN: Agent Jones?
-FINOLA: Yeah.

17:56.326 --> 17:58.578
CHIN: We’ve cataloged every
piece that’s been pulled
into the Seam so far.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.872
Some of the pieces involved
manipulation of thermodynamics,

18:00.914 --> 18:03.833
others affected botanical
gene expression and acoustical
distortion.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.753
But it seems they aren’t being
used for any of those functions.

18:06.795 --> 18:08.672
There’s no commonalities
between any of them.

18:08.713 --> 18:11.299
Wildly varying sizes,
textures,

18:11.341 --> 18:13.468
Laghari signatures
all over the map.

18:13.510 --> 18:15.345
I don’t understand.

18:15.387 --> 18:20.058
These Debris pieces were brought
together for a reason.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.103
Maybe we should try and get
these cases out of here.

18:23.144 --> 18:25.897
The Seam can’t take
what’s not here.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.607
All right, let’s do it.

18:30.402 --> 18:32.195
Grab the other side.

18:32.237 --> 18:34.489
(grunts)

18:34.531 --> 18:36.991
Whoa! Lester! Lester! Hey!

18:37.033 --> 18:39.744
Hey! Hey! Can you hear me?

18:41.246 --> 18:43.790
Now take it up slowly.
Oh my goodness, what happened?

18:43.832 --> 18:46.835
Are you okay?
Lester, hey!

18:46.876 --> 18:49.713
Oh, my goodness.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.009
Whoa! Whoa! Hey!

18:54.050 --> 18:56.302
No, Lester!

18:58.013 --> 19:00.390
Hey.

19:00.432 --> 19:03.268
Lester, where are you going?

19:11.860 --> 19:13.528
BRYAN:
Why do you think
the affected techs

19:13.570 --> 19:15.071
can touch the cases
but Chin couldn’t?

19:15.113 --> 19:18.742
I don’t know.
Because they’re a part of it?

19:18.783 --> 19:22.078
What did you find with the ship
in the hangar?

19:22.120 --> 19:24.914
I didn’t find anything.
It’s the same as it’s been.

19:24.956 --> 19:27.751
There’s no excess
Laghari signatures.

19:27.792 --> 19:31.087
So if the event started there,
it’s not there anymore.

19:31.129 --> 19:34.758
What if it’s building something
inside the Seam to destroy us?

19:34.799 --> 19:36.885
I’m not sure that we
can get out of this, Bryan.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.470
BRYAN:
Oh, we’re going
to figure it out.

19:38.511 --> 19:42.390
I can’t comprehend what
is going on in there.

19:42.432 --> 19:46.853
We’re not meant to.
We thought we were in control,
but maybe we need to acknowledge

19:46.895 --> 19:51.608
that we are in the presence
of something bigger and stronger
than us.

19:54.069 --> 19:56.488
And impossibly unknowable.

19:57.822 --> 20:00.283
It’s just moving so fast.

20:00.325 --> 20:03.995
Hey! What is wrong with him?

20:04.037 --> 20:06.414
Arturo! Look at me! Chin up!

20:12.337 --> 20:13.505
He’s dead.

20:16.216 --> 20:19.094
FINOLA: How long before
the same thing happens
to the rest of them?

20:32.148 --> 20:33.316
Nice.

20:33.358 --> 20:39.155
There you go.

20:46.663 --> 20:48.623
(electricity hums)

20:53.545 --> 20:55.130
(power surging)

21:13.606 --> 21:15.150
(phone rings)

21:15.191 --> 21:18.653
The signatures of the pieces
that it’s selecting,

21:18.695 --> 21:21.072
what can you tell me about them?

21:21.114 --> 21:24.492
It’s random signatures--
933,

21:24.534 --> 21:28.621
<i>467, 311, 233.</i>

21:28.663 --> 21:29.748
That’s not random.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.291
<i>That’s a series of ratios;</i>

21:31.332 --> 21:33.710
<i>a half, a third, a quarter.</i>

21:33.752 --> 21:35.587
It’s a harmonic sequence.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.547
Oh, God. Yes, yes, yes.

21:37.589 --> 21:39.341
(chuckles)
Of course.

21:39.382 --> 21:43.094
Finola, prolonged exposure
to Laghari harmonics

21:43.136 --> 21:45.221
can cause catastrophic
brain damage.

21:45.263 --> 21:47.265
<i>That would explain</i>
<i>what happened to Zimmer.</i>

21:47.307 --> 21:48.350
Right.

21:48.391 --> 21:49.434
The Seam.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.519
You have to focus on that.

21:51.561 --> 21:55.565
<i>It could widen.</i>
<i>It could swallow up</i>
<i>everything in its path.</i>

21:55.607 --> 21:58.234
It could emit a kinetic pulse

21:58.276 --> 22:00.195
<i>that can throw the earth</i>
<i>off its axis.</i>

22:00.236 --> 22:03.573
The N-U’s,
they weren’t effective?

22:03.615 --> 22:06.326
No. They weren’t effective
at all.

22:06.368 --> 22:11.247
<i>All right, the N-U’s were</i>
<i>designed to contain Debris</i>
<i>emissions.</i>

22:11.289 --> 22:14.668
If you reverse the polarity,
that could create

22:14.709 --> 22:16.002
<i>an energy fence.</i>

22:16.044 --> 22:19.255
So like, um,
protective force field

22:19.297 --> 22:20.924
to stop the new pieces
from passing through?

22:20.965 --> 22:22.842
Yes. Exactly.
That could interrupt

22:22.884 --> 22:24.260
and suspend the process.

22:24.302 --> 22:26.221
<i>At least I’ll give you</i>
<i>some time to</i>

22:26.262 --> 22:28.056
<i>try to figure out how</i>
<i>to stop this thing.</i>

22:28.098 --> 22:29.808
-Right.
<i>-Just go back</i>

22:29.849 --> 22:32.018
and see if reversing
the polarity works,

22:32.060 --> 22:33.812
<i>-all right?</i>
-Okay.

22:33.853 --> 22:37.816
And Finola, be careful.

22:41.444 --> 22:43.613
(phone beeps)

22:52.038 --> 22:53.957
(beeping)

22:53.998 --> 22:56.042
Wait, what’s that noise?

22:56.084 --> 22:57.919
It started just
a few minutes ago

22:57.961 --> 23:00.255
after the last case
got sucked in.

23:00.296 --> 23:03.842
Whatever the Seam is doing,
it’s getting near completion.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.969
You have any ideas?

23:06.011 --> 23:07.345
FINOLA: Yeah. I’m not sure
it’s going to work,

23:07.387 --> 23:09.180
but it is worth a try.

23:09.222 --> 23:11.349
We need to reverse
the polarity on the N-U’s

23:11.391 --> 23:13.018
to stop any more new pieces
from entering.

23:13.059 --> 23:14.602
That would externalize
the energy field.

23:14.644 --> 23:17.063
The whole point of the N-U’s
is containment.

23:17.105 --> 23:18.982
Yes. But we have to stop
the rest of those cases

23:19.024 --> 23:21.359
from joining whatever
is being assembled.

23:21.401 --> 23:23.361
This might be our best chance.

23:23.403 --> 23:24.696
(plastic case clattering)

23:31.703 --> 23:33.246
Yeah.

23:33.288 --> 23:35.457
I’m zeroed in.
We’re stable.

23:35.498 --> 23:38.418
Okay. Great. Shut it down?

23:38.460 --> 23:40.128
Prepare to recalibrate.

23:40.170 --> 23:41.671
Recalibrating now.

23:42.797 --> 23:46.634
Reversing polarity,
powering up again.

23:46.676 --> 23:48.803
(energy humming)

23:58.897 --> 24:01.316
Oh. Good job.

24:01.358 --> 24:05.362
Three-eleven.
Second harmonic ratio.

24:08.740 --> 24:11.326
-What was that?
-What is it?

24:11.368 --> 24:14.329
There’s a second
Laghari reading-- 467.

24:14.371 --> 24:18.083
-Finola--
-There’s something
happening below us.

24:26.383 --> 24:29.427
Security is disabled.
It should be open.

24:33.390 --> 24:35.058
(device scanning)

24:45.068 --> 24:46.695
FINOLA:
What is this place?

24:46.736 --> 24:48.697
BRYAN:
Never been down here.

24:48.738 --> 24:51.741
(device scanning)

24:51.783 --> 24:55.161
BRYAN:
Wow.

24:55.203 --> 24:59.040
Looks like there was some
sort of an explosion here.

25:05.880 --> 25:08.800
FINOLA:
Oh, there it is.

25:10.635 --> 25:11.845
Wow.

25:15.640 --> 25:17.225
This is interesting.

25:20.437 --> 25:22.564
These are schematics.

25:22.605 --> 25:26.443
They’re turning out
a bomb using Debris.

25:26.484 --> 25:28.403
This is a weapons lab.

25:28.445 --> 25:31.906
Orbital is weaponizing
the Debris.

25:31.948 --> 25:33.783
BRYAN:
I’m not surprised.

25:33.825 --> 25:35.201
They were gonna do it
eventually.

25:35.243 --> 25:37.370
FINOLA:
So this experiment--

25:37.412 --> 25:40.623
BRYAN:
It might have triggered
the event.

25:40.665 --> 25:44.502
Did Maddox know about this
and then just say it was INFLUX?

25:57.849 --> 26:00.769
Bryan. Oh my God.

26:00.810 --> 26:02.687
What?

26:02.729 --> 26:05.315
This is my father’s notes.

26:08.151 --> 26:10.945
They are engineering

26:10.987 --> 26:14.324
all of these weapons
using my father’s work!

26:24.709 --> 26:29.214
I’m must ask you this.
To your theory about INFLUX

26:29.255 --> 26:31.257
being responsible
for all of this,

26:31.299 --> 26:34.469
what part did you play?

26:34.511 --> 26:38.306
Because I know
what you’re doing.

26:38.348 --> 26:40.225
You’ve been to the lab
on the sub floor.

26:40.266 --> 26:43.186
Is this why you’re here?

26:43.228 --> 26:45.271
Because you’re worried
that we would find it?

26:45.313 --> 26:47.273
’Cause you know what?
From what I saw,

26:47.315 --> 26:49.818
it could have triggered
this whole event.

26:49.859 --> 26:53.446
Finola, no one in our classified
division has been doing any
testing,

26:53.488 --> 26:55.532
so no, we are not
responsible for it.

26:55.573 --> 26:58.993
But you are weaponizing
the Debris.

26:59.035 --> 27:02.497
To deter potential adversaries
from attacking the United
States,

27:02.539 --> 27:05.709
from attacking our allies,
from attacking our vital
interests.

27:05.750 --> 27:08.461
The Chinese are doing it,
the Russians are doing it.

27:08.503 --> 27:10.505
And you know what?
The Brits are doing it.

27:12.340 --> 27:17.178
Did my father know that you were
using his work for this?

27:17.220 --> 27:20.390
No, he didn’t.

27:20.432 --> 27:21.891
Not at first.

27:21.933 --> 27:23.059
But he did find out.

27:23.101 --> 27:25.812
And what did he feel about it?

27:25.854 --> 27:27.981
Pretty much the same way you do.

27:28.023 --> 27:30.191
Finola, I know how personal
this is for you,

27:30.233 --> 27:31.651
but you have to understand
men like your father,

27:31.693 --> 27:34.320
they’re like pieces
of Debris themselves,

27:34.362 --> 27:36.364
useful in the right hands,

27:36.406 --> 27:38.158
dangerous in the wrong hands.

27:38.199 --> 27:40.660
Orbital had no choice but
to follow this direction,

27:40.702 --> 27:43.329
because if we didn’t do it,
someone else would have done it.

27:43.371 --> 27:46.666
In fact, Finola,
someone else did do it.

27:46.708 --> 27:50.545
It’s exactly what INFLUX
has been doing with your father,

27:50.587 --> 27:54.007
so I know you know how vital
it is that we find him.

27:54.049 --> 27:56.176
I know you feel that way.

27:56.217 --> 28:01.598
You don’t know anything
about what I feel.

28:01.639 --> 28:07.687
My father took his life
for all of this.

28:18.615 --> 28:21.534
(gasping)

28:21.576 --> 28:22.619
(grunts)

28:25.497 --> 28:27.749
HAZMAT #3:
Cain. Cain!

28:29.876 --> 28:31.378
Hey, hey, hey, hey, look!

28:31.419 --> 28:33.672
Stop! Just stop!
(straining)

28:33.713 --> 28:36.299
Bryan! Bryan, they’re leaving
the boardroom!

28:36.341 --> 28:37.759
We can’t hold them back.

28:37.801 --> 28:38.968
They’re trying to get back
to the lockup.

28:39.010 --> 28:40.428
I’m almost there.

28:40.470 --> 28:41.805
FINOLA:
Bryan, I’m on my way back.

28:45.225 --> 28:47.477
Hey! We need some help.

28:47.519 --> 28:49.354
Hey, hey, get him, get him.

28:49.396 --> 28:51.481
-BRYAN: Hey, hey!
-FINOLA: Hey, hey, hey!
I got him.

28:51.523 --> 28:53.566
-BRYAN: Hey, hey! Hey!
-FINOLA: Hey! Stop!

28:53.608 --> 28:55.819
They’re after the N-U’s.

29:00.073 --> 29:03.201
Chin! Chin! Get up! Hey!

29:03.243 --> 29:06.121
Let’s get these guys back
to the boardroom right now.

29:07.288 --> 29:09.165
FINOLA:
What have we got?

29:09.207 --> 29:11.459
APRIL HAN:
The leakage from their ears
is cerebral spinal fluid,

29:11.501 --> 29:13.753
must have been massive
intracranial pressure.

29:13.795 --> 29:15.171
DOCTOR #2:
There was necrotic cell death,

29:15.213 --> 29:17.257
like the cells
literally exploded.

29:17.298 --> 29:18.675
What could cause that?

29:18.717 --> 29:20.552
Chemical agents
or ultrasound or--

29:20.593 --> 29:23.763
Harmonic frequencies
in the Laghari spectrum?

29:23.805 --> 29:25.473
Yes, that’s possible.

30:04.929 --> 30:05.930
No.

30:11.436 --> 30:13.188
(latches slam)

30:15.398 --> 30:16.858
-(electricity surging)
-(gasps)

30:30.497 --> 30:32.582
(Mariel whispering, indistinct)

31:38.606 --> 31:40.650
TOGETHER:
Why?

32:20.732 --> 32:24.402
(page turning in distance)

32:24.444 --> 32:26.446
(Ash whistles)
Morrison.

32:28.406 --> 32:29.741
GUARD:
What do you want, Ash?

32:29.783 --> 32:32.452
I’m sick.
I need to see a doctor.

32:38.166 --> 32:39.501
GUARD:
Open 108.

32:39.542 --> 32:41.002
(buzzer sounds)

32:43.421 --> 32:44.798
Out.

32:55.642 --> 32:57.686
What the hell?

33:04.150 --> 33:05.568
We need to get him
to an emergency room.

33:05.610 --> 33:07.737
He’s got something inside him.

33:07.779 --> 33:09.614
Told you I was sick.

33:09.656 --> 33:10.865
(neck cracks)

33:13.159 --> 33:14.577
That’s it.

33:14.619 --> 33:18.581
Let’s get the keys
for these cuffs

33:18.623 --> 33:20.083
out of this belt, shall we?

33:21.251 --> 33:22.877
Need to get in there.

33:22.919 --> 33:26.464
Six-eight-six-eight-zero-eight.

33:26.506 --> 33:29.050
-(buzzer sounds)
-Go on.

33:31.177 --> 33:33.805
APRIL HAN:
Let’s try a new CSX sample,
expose it to Laghari waves,

33:33.847 --> 33:35.306
-try to replicate the effect.
-WOMAN: Yes, Doctor.

33:35.348 --> 33:37.392
Okay. When you’re done here,
let me know.

33:37.434 --> 33:40.103
I’ll take it to the boardroom,
where we’re keeping the techs.

33:48.862 --> 33:49.821
Hey.

33:54.409 --> 33:55.660
What’s wrong?

33:58.747 --> 34:00.790
I saw Mariel Caldwell.

34:00.832 --> 34:03.710
What are you talking about?

34:03.752 --> 34:06.588
The Debris manifested her
for me.

34:06.629 --> 34:09.007
-What?
-She appeared.

34:09.049 --> 34:10.800
Yeah.

34:10.842 --> 34:12.469
Remember when I told you
in my memory

34:12.510 --> 34:14.596
she came to me
and I asked her why?

34:14.637 --> 34:18.725
Why she needed me to relive
that memory in Afghanistan?

34:18.767 --> 34:22.103
And I put my hand out,
but you-- you pulled me back

34:22.145 --> 34:24.522
before I could grab it.

34:24.564 --> 34:25.899
<i>She did it again.</i>

34:28.401 --> 34:31.488
<i>But this time...</i>

34:31.529 --> 34:33.740
<i>I touched her.</i>

34:33.782 --> 34:37.035
<i>And in that moment,</i>
<i>I understood everything,</i>

34:37.077 --> 34:39.788
<i>without a single word</i>
<i>being spoken.</i>

34:39.829 --> 34:42.999
What did you understand?

34:43.041 --> 34:46.628
I understood
it wanted to comprehend

34:46.670 --> 34:50.298
my need to protect people.

34:50.340 --> 34:51.633
Why would it do that?

34:51.675 --> 34:54.344
I don’t know.
It sought me out.

34:54.386 --> 34:57.472
And we need to let the Seam
complete what it’s doing.

34:57.514 --> 35:00.725
Okay. Listen, I think
we should take you outside

35:00.767 --> 35:02.519
-and just get you checked out.
-I know what I’m saying.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.145
I know how I must sound
right now,

35:04.187 --> 35:05.689
but if we interfere
with this process,

35:05.730 --> 35:07.273
we are going to kill people.

35:07.315 --> 35:09.067
We’re not gonna be able
to save them.

35:09.109 --> 35:12.612
I can feel it.
I can feel it.

35:14.614 --> 35:18.743
What happened to the man
who said we need to sacrifice
the few to save the many?

35:18.785 --> 35:21.579
This isn’t you.

35:21.621 --> 35:22.789
I know.

35:25.375 --> 35:28.128
But this is what it’s asking
of us right now.

35:28.169 --> 35:30.755
I can’t describe it any better.

35:33.466 --> 35:35.510
Not so long ago, you told me

35:35.552 --> 35:37.095
that you were not scared
of the Debris,

35:37.137 --> 35:38.763
that you thought could change
the world.

35:38.805 --> 35:40.140
I thought you were crazy.

35:42.976 --> 35:44.394
But now I understand it.

35:47.105 --> 35:49.315
And that’s faith, right?

35:49.357 --> 35:51.026
Yeah.

35:51.067 --> 35:54.404
That’s what you’ve been
telling me all about,

35:54.446 --> 35:58.366
trust in something that
you cannot know for certain.

35:59.909 --> 36:03.496
But we don’t know
what it’s building.

36:03.538 --> 36:05.331
We don’t know.

36:07.500 --> 36:10.420
You’re afraid...

36:10.462 --> 36:12.380
and that’s not you.

36:15.050 --> 36:18.386
I’m asking you
to believe again.

36:21.681 --> 36:25.018
For the first time, I do.

36:27.604 --> 36:29.647
Take that defibrillator
to the middle of the room.

36:29.689 --> 36:33.360
Hurry, hurry.
Come on. Chop chop.

36:33.401 --> 36:34.944
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

36:34.986 --> 36:36.529
Next to this one, closer.

36:36.571 --> 36:37.822
A little bit closer.

36:37.864 --> 36:39.157
That’s perfect.

36:39.199 --> 36:40.658
Now go and get that wheelchair.

36:40.700 --> 36:41.910
Hurry!

36:46.331 --> 36:47.874
Power these up.

36:49.876 --> 36:51.044
-This is going to kill you.
-Either do it to me,

36:51.086 --> 36:52.379
or I’ll do it to you.

36:52.420 --> 36:53.630
All the way up.
Full power.

36:53.672 --> 36:55.840
That one too.

36:55.882 --> 36:59.010
(power increasing)

37:00.345 --> 37:01.971
(power surges)

37:02.013 --> 37:03.473
-(horn honks)
-(glass shatters)

37:03.515 --> 37:04.724
(groans)

37:21.533 --> 37:22.450
(neck cracks)

37:25.036 --> 37:27.038
Can I trouble you
for your car keys?

37:27.080 --> 37:28.748
(whirring, beeping)

37:31.543 --> 37:33.461
Shut it down.

37:33.503 --> 37:35.255
You sure?

37:37.549 --> 37:39.467
Shut it down.

37:39.509 --> 37:41.302
(machine beeps)

37:41.344 --> 37:43.304
(powering down)

37:49.310 --> 37:51.146
(case clattering)

38:11.041 --> 38:12.208
That was the last one.

38:13.585 --> 38:15.962
No, I don’t think so.

38:17.130 --> 38:20.717
The Debris that we found
downstairs

38:20.759 --> 38:23.011
did not initiate this.

38:23.053 --> 38:25.847
It’s a piece of the Seam.
it’s trying to get--

38:29.309 --> 38:32.062
-Go get me a Nacho.
-Copy that.

38:56.753 --> 38:58.338
(whispers)
We’re ready.

39:01.341 --> 39:02.342
Copy.

39:06.513 --> 39:07.472
Do it.

39:51.224 --> 39:54.060
It’s the ball of light.

40:44.235 --> 40:47.489
GEORGE: And the techs were
released as soon as it left?

40:47.530 --> 40:51.201
<i>FINOLA:</i>
<i>Yes. It’s like</i>
<i>nothing happened.</i>

40:51.242 --> 40:53.578
GEORGE:
That’s utterly amazing.

40:53.620 --> 40:56.956
<i>FINOLA: It was the most</i>
<i>beautiful thing I’ve ever seen,</i>

40:56.998 --> 41:00.502
but it’s just so unsettling not
knowing what happened to it.

41:05.340 --> 41:07.592
<i>Dad, are you listening to me?</i>

41:07.634 --> 41:09.594
I found it.

41:09.636 --> 41:12.013
<i>The piece that we’re looking</i>
<i>for, I’ve found it.</i>

41:14.224 --> 41:16.518
It’s in Virginia.

41:16.559 --> 41:17.727
(line ringing)

41:19.145 --> 41:21.481
<i>MADDOX (on phone):</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

41:21.523 --> 41:22.273
Are you ready?

41:22.315 --> 41:23.650
<i>Is the rest of it here?</i>

41:23.692 --> 41:26.986
It’s in the state,
a remote location.

41:27.028 --> 41:29.948
<i>It just got here,</i>
<i>we can do it tomorrow.</i>

41:29.989 --> 41:31.116
Okay.

41:31.157 --> 41:32.367
<i>Let me know when.</i>

41:32.409 --> 41:33.368
I will.

41:52.679 --> 41:54.222
(hands rubbing)

41:54.264 --> 41:56.141
-You’re early.
-Turn on the heat.

41:56.182 --> 42:00.228
A burger, a taco,
and a milkshake.

42:00.270 --> 42:02.689
Anything with fats,
meat, and oil.

42:02.731 --> 42:03.732
(ringtone chimes)

42:05.817 --> 42:07.110
(chuckles)

42:07.152 --> 42:09.404
Otto says George Jones
has identified

42:09.446 --> 42:12.198
the location of the piece.

42:12.240 --> 42:13.783
Man’s a genius.

42:36.639 --> 42:39.100
<i>WOMAN: We’ve put him</i>
<i>in a barometric chamber.</i>

42:39.142 --> 42:40.268
(beep)

42:42.562 --> 42:44.272
<i>He keeps repeating himself.</i>

42:44.314 --> 42:45.899
<i>He keeps saying the word</i>

42:45.940 --> 42:48.443
<i>"telesphere" over and over.</i>

42:48.485 --> 42:49.611
(beep)

42:51.237 --> 42:52.781
<i>What is that?</i>

42:52.822 --> 42:54.157
(beep)

42:56.493 --> 42:58.161
<i>-MAN: I don’t know.</i>
-(beep)
