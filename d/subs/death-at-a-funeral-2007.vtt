WEBVTT

03:34.839 --> 03:37.740
Just straight through there
and to the left, please.

03:57.194 --> 03:58.455
Okay.

04:05.668 --> 04:08.000
Would you like to...

04:26.356 --> 04:27.823
Who's this?

04:28.591 --> 04:29.615
Pardon me?

04:30.293 --> 04:32.090
That's not my father.

04:35.031 --> 04:37.555
Oh, shit, we've taken the wrong one.

04:38.167 --> 04:40.795
Really sorry about that, sir.
We'll go back and get him.

04:40.869 --> 04:42.131
Come on.

04:49.344 --> 04:50.606
Jesus.

05:16.472 --> 05:18.701
They brought the wrong coffin.

05:19.107 --> 05:20.631
You're joking.

05:22.176 --> 05:24.804
Can you believe that?
It's a good job I checked.

05:24.879 --> 05:28.007
Could have been having a service
for some random member of the public.

05:28.082 --> 05:30.846
What kind of Mickey Mouse business are
these people running, anyway?

05:30.918 --> 05:32.078
My God!

05:32.153 --> 05:35.020
There's just so much to worry about,
you know. And Mum's in a state.

05:35.089 --> 05:37.751
Robert's clearly not gonna do anything
to help, assuming he gets here at all.

05:37.825 --> 05:39.190
Plus, this eulogy's just awful.

05:39.560 --> 05:43.018
- I'm sure it's not awful, Daniel.
- Yeah, it is. It is.

05:43.231 --> 05:45.461
Everyone's going to be thinking,
"Why isn't Robert doing the eulogy?

05:45.533 --> 05:47.694
"He's such a great writer."
Maybe I should just let him do it.

05:47.768 --> 05:50.862
You are every bit as good a writer
as your brother, Daniel, if not better.

05:50.938 --> 05:53.839
You've just got to let somebody else
read your novel.

05:53.908 --> 05:56.398
Yeah, everything's going to be okay.

05:56.476 --> 05:59.468
Once the funeral's over,
we've just got to focus

05:59.546 --> 06:03.209
on moving out of here
and starting our own lives properly.

06:07.287 --> 06:10.347
You did call them, didn't you, Daniel?

06:11.024 --> 06:15.620
- You did put the deposit on the flat?
- Yeah, I'll sort it out, I promise.

06:19.599 --> 06:23.501
God, I hate funerals. Don't you?
Really, they're just so depressing.

06:23.570 --> 06:26.061
I don't know,
it's just the death and everything.

06:26.139 --> 06:29.973
Do you know what I mean?
Do you agree, Justin? Justin?

06:30.043 --> 06:31.977
Yeah, they're all right.

06:32.045 --> 06:36.378
All right? Sorry, how could you
possibly think that they're all right?

06:36.448 --> 06:39.815
Why are you even coming to this?
Anyway, you don't even know Daniel.

06:39.885 --> 06:41.318
I do know Daniel.
I met him a couple of times.

06:41.387 --> 06:43.321
A couple of times.
But he's not a friend, is he?

06:43.389 --> 06:44.686
No, not a friend.

06:44.757 --> 06:46.486
Sorry, if you're going to smoke,

06:46.559 --> 06:47.958
would you please put that
out of the window?

06:48.027 --> 06:51.155
I'd really rather not get your cancer,
thank you very much.

06:51.230 --> 06:54.222
I've got enough of my own problems
to be worrying about.

06:54.300 --> 06:55.699
Yeah? Like what?

06:55.768 --> 07:00.671
Like the discoloration on my wrist
that I keep telling you about. Look at it.

07:01.240 --> 07:04.334
It's fucked. I'm fucked.

07:06.946 --> 07:08.971
Why are you even coming?

07:10.316 --> 07:12.807
It's because of Martha, isn't it?

07:15.186 --> 07:16.483
Justin.

07:18.856 --> 07:22.155
- Are you okay?
- Not too bad, thanks, Martha.

07:23.695 --> 07:26.789
- I'm a bit nervous.
- About seeing my dad?

07:26.864 --> 07:30.732
I just don't think I've ever been
so openly hated by anyone before.

07:30.802 --> 07:33.896
He just hates everyone.
You mustn't take it to heart.

07:33.972 --> 07:37.965
- You need to relax with him.
- I can't help it. He puts me on edge.

07:38.042 --> 07:40.340
He's going to be more concerned
that his sister's husband's just died.

07:40.411 --> 07:42.174
He's not going to be focused on you.

07:42.247 --> 07:46.274
Anyway, I'm sure when I tell him that
we're getting married then, you know,

07:46.351 --> 07:48.046
he'll start to learn to accept you.

07:48.119 --> 07:50.383
- You sure about that?
- Of course.

07:50.455 --> 07:53.481
I don't really see Victor
as the accepting type.

07:57.060 --> 08:01.429
We're on our way to a funeral,
you wanker! Don't you have any respect?

08:03.700 --> 08:06.999
Okay. Calm down.
It's all right, it's all right. Breathe.

08:07.504 --> 08:09.768
In through your nose, okay?

08:10.007 --> 08:11.634
Deep breaths. You all right?

08:11.708 --> 08:13.972
- Yeah.
- Fucking tosser.

08:23.820 --> 08:25.378
Okay, I'm going to go down.

08:25.455 --> 08:27.252
Hopefully they've brought
the right coffin this time.

08:27.324 --> 08:29.189
- I'll come with you.
- No, it's okay. I can do it.

08:29.259 --> 08:31.921
Oh, no, I know you can. I'm just going
to come check on the seating.

08:31.995 --> 08:34.019
Make sure there's enough room
for Uncle Alfie.

08:34.096 --> 08:36.724
Oh, shit. Shit! Shit!

08:38.701 --> 08:40.293
Hello?

08:40.369 --> 08:43.304
Hello, mate, how are you? All right?

08:43.371 --> 08:44.805
Yeah.

08:44.874 --> 08:47.843
Of course I remember Uncle Alfie. Yeah.

08:47.910 --> 08:51.346
Absolutely fine. Yeah, yeah.
No, not a problem at all.

08:51.414 --> 08:55.316
No. Of course I don't mind. All right.

08:55.384 --> 08:58.353
Yeah, don't worry. All right.
No, it's fine, I promise.

08:58.421 --> 09:01.015
All right, we'll see you soon. Okay, bye.

09:01.090 --> 09:02.284
Shit!

09:18.206 --> 09:20.504
So, is this your father, sir?

09:24.646 --> 09:26.238
Yes, it is, yes.

09:39.461 --> 09:41.452
Hey, Mum. You all right?

09:41.529 --> 09:44.225
I just don't know
what I'm going to do without him.

09:44.299 --> 09:46.529
- What have I got to live for now?
- Mum, don't be silly.

09:46.601 --> 09:50.833
You've got your friends, family.
You've got me and Jane and Robert.

09:50.905 --> 09:52.338
Where is Robert?
Have you heard from him?

09:52.407 --> 09:55.375
His plane was just landed at 10:00,
but he'll be here, don't worry.

09:55.442 --> 09:57.933
Now, if there's anything I can do, Sandra.

09:58.011 --> 10:01.742
Don't put your hand there, dear.
You'll leave smudge marks.

10:17.698 --> 10:20.599
All right.
No, I'll get them to you this evening.

10:20.667 --> 10:23.636
No, no can do this afternoon.
I've got a funeral.

10:23.704 --> 10:26.172
Yeah, my uncle died. Yeah, tragic.

10:26.240 --> 10:29.038
No, I'm telling you, mate,
this is really powerful stuff.

10:29.109 --> 10:31.737
Yeah, you really only need to take half.

10:31.945 --> 10:34.378
No, trust me, they're going to blow
your fucking head off.

10:35.615 --> 10:38.106
All right, I got to go. Sister's here.
I'll take them with me

10:38.184 --> 10:41.642
and drop them by after the funeral.
Okay, catch you later. Bye.

10:55.067 --> 10:57.035
Yeah, hang on.

11:02.809 --> 11:04.470
Hi. How's it going?

11:04.544 --> 11:06.171
Troy, you're not ready.
Come on, we're gonna be late.

11:06.245 --> 11:09.339
Just need to put on my trousers
and I'm done. You guys okay?

11:09.415 --> 11:11.713
Simon's a bit freaked out.
We just had some arsehole driver

11:11.784 --> 11:14.013
- almost ram us off the road.
- Really? Fucking bastards.

11:14.085 --> 11:17.145
Make yourselves comfy.
I'll be two minutes.

11:17.222 --> 11:20.385
- What are these pills all over the place?
- Troy's studying to be a pharmacist.

11:21.693 --> 11:24.253
- Are you okay?
- I'm a bit shaky.

11:24.963 --> 11:26.897
Not much, just a...

11:27.399 --> 11:28.798
Just a bit.

11:29.367 --> 11:32.097
Here, have one of these.

11:33.305 --> 11:36.206
- It'll calm you down.
- Are you sure?

11:36.274 --> 11:40.301
Absolutely. It's just Valium.
I used to take them all the time.

11:40.378 --> 11:42.869
It'll make you feel better, honestly.

11:42.948 --> 11:44.711
Come on, open wide.

11:52.923 --> 11:54.185
Ready.

11:59.296 --> 12:00.627
Thank you.

12:06.670 --> 12:07.967
Hello?

12:11.208 --> 12:13.676
- Hello?
- Robert?

12:14.445 --> 12:15.742
Robert.

12:15.946 --> 12:18.210
- Hi, Mum.
- Oh, darling.

12:18.282 --> 12:20.443
How are you, sweetheart?

12:23.087 --> 12:24.554
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:24.622 --> 12:26.852
- Hey, how are you doing? Yeah?
- Okay. Okay. I'm okay.

12:26.924 --> 12:29.620
- Okay. Hi.
- Hi, Robert.

12:29.693 --> 12:31.284
- How are you?
- Good. Good. How are you?

12:31.361 --> 12:33.022
- Great.
- How was the flight?

12:33.096 --> 12:35.428
Great. There was a lot of turbulence,
which was a bit worrying.

12:35.498 --> 12:37.557
But, I mean,
I guess that's the thing about first class.

12:37.634 --> 12:39.295
It doesn't matter how much you pay
for the ticket,

12:39.369 --> 12:42.668
if the plane crashes,
you're all gonna end up dead.

12:43.873 --> 12:45.135
Sorry.

12:45.909 --> 12:48.207
No, no, I'll... Don't worry.

12:52.282 --> 12:53.579
Oh, shit.

13:06.496 --> 13:08.020
That's him.

13:08.331 --> 13:11.663
Jesus, Howard, you didn't say he was
going to be in a fucking wheelchair.

13:25.147 --> 13:29.140
Uncle Alfie. Hello.
We're here to take you to the funeral.

13:29.217 --> 13:32.050
Where the fuck have you been?
You're late.

13:57.511 --> 13:59.604
This is bloody grim, isn't it?

13:59.680 --> 14:03.275
- It's not supposed to be fun, Robert.
- I know, but Jesus.

14:04.151 --> 14:06.745
I feel like my heart has been

14:07.188 --> 14:10.851
- wrenched out of my ribcage. It's awful.
- Well, that's grief for you.

14:11.092 --> 14:13.151
This is why I prefer not to have
close relationships with people.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.695
There's too much emotion involved.

14:18.633 --> 14:21.568
Well, I'm just glad that
you're gonna be here with Mum.

14:21.636 --> 14:25.231
Well, yeah. Well, not for long,
'cause Jane and I are moving out.

14:26.540 --> 14:30.498
- Well, what about Mum?
- I was thinking maybe she'd like to

14:31.077 --> 14:33.739
come to New York with you for a bit.

14:34.381 --> 14:36.178
Well, don't be ridiculous.
I can't take her to New York.

14:36.249 --> 14:38.114
What am I gonna do with her,
take her to parties?

14:38.184 --> 14:40.709
But we've already decided.
We're putting a deposit on a flat.

14:40.787 --> 14:42.152
And I'm gonna need the money.

14:42.222 --> 14:45.453
- What money?
- The money for all this, for the funeral.

14:45.525 --> 14:47.220
You agreed to pay for half.

14:47.293 --> 14:48.988
- Did I?
- Yeah.

14:49.729 --> 14:51.697
- Oh, right.
- Yeah, so...

14:53.233 --> 14:55.224
Yeah, well, I don't have it on me, Daniel.

14:55.301 --> 14:57.792
I can get it to you in a few months.

14:57.871 --> 14:59.930
In a few months? Robert, I need it now.
I need the money now.

15:00.006 --> 15:01.940
Yeah, well, that's not gonna happen, is it?
'Cause I'm totally skint.

15:02.008 --> 15:04.101
What do you mean you're skint?

15:04.177 --> 15:06.338
You're a successful novelist.
You live in New York.

15:06.413 --> 15:08.404
You've got a penthouse apartment
in New York. What do you mean?

15:08.481 --> 15:10.471
Yeah, and do you have any idea
how much it costs for the upkeep?

15:10.549 --> 15:13.916
Besides which, I've just had to lay out
a fortune for the flight over here.

15:13.986 --> 15:16.750
Do you know how much they're charging
for first class nowadays?

15:16.822 --> 15:18.949
It's a fucking disgrace!

15:21.427 --> 15:24.362
- So, poor old Uncle Eddie, eh?
- Yeah.

15:24.530 --> 15:25.622
Yes.

15:25.698 --> 15:28.360
Did you ever meet Uncle Eddie, Simon?

15:28.867 --> 15:30.164
Simon?

15:30.836 --> 15:33.327
Was there a dog in here just now?

15:33.572 --> 15:34.869
What?

15:36.075 --> 15:38.703
I'm sure there was a dog in here.

15:38.911 --> 15:41.539
What the hell are you talking about?

15:59.864 --> 16:02.492
There's just nowhere to park.

16:03.167 --> 16:05.260
- This is ridiculous.
- How about over there?

16:05.336 --> 16:07.531
That guy's coming out over there.

16:07.605 --> 16:08.765
- Oh, right.
- Take it, take it!

16:08.840 --> 16:10.102
All right!

16:10.174 --> 16:11.163
What are you doing?

16:13.111 --> 16:15.045
Are you mental?

16:18.850 --> 16:20.112
Sorry.

16:20.384 --> 16:23.012
Excuse me? Hi, sorry. Oh, hi, Martha.

16:23.087 --> 16:27.682
- I was just about to park there, actually.
- Yeah, well, are you a relative, Howard?

16:27.758 --> 16:30.192
- No, I'm not, but...
- Hey, Martha.

16:31.695 --> 16:33.094
Who's that?

16:41.972 --> 16:43.269
- What's happening?
- Did you see that?

16:43.340 --> 16:44.534
She barely even looked at me.

16:44.608 --> 16:46.166
I said, what's happening? Are we there?

16:46.243 --> 16:48.336
Oh, my God,
we've got Uncle Alfie in the car.

16:48.411 --> 16:51.847
I cannot believe I forgot to say
we've got Uncle Alfie in the car.

16:53.016 --> 16:56.179
- All right! Keep your hair on!
- What the hell's going on?

16:57.320 --> 16:59.254
She barely even looked.

17:08.564 --> 17:11.829
It's very green here, isn't it? It's very...

17:12.401 --> 17:14.493
- It's green!
- Simon.

17:15.503 --> 17:18.666
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- What do you mean?

17:18.741 --> 17:23.405
All this talking about phantom dogs
and things being green. What's going on?

17:23.746 --> 17:25.236
I don't know.

17:30.486 --> 17:31.578
Wow!

17:35.191 --> 17:36.488
Martha,

17:37.226 --> 17:41.185
- is Simon normally like this?
- Of course he's not normally like this.

17:41.263 --> 17:43.197
Something's not right.

17:44.700 --> 17:45.962
Hello.

17:53.708 --> 17:56.040
Oh, I think it must be the Valium.

17:56.110 --> 17:57.702
- Valium?
- Yeah.

17:58.613 --> 18:00.979
I gave him a Valium from your flat.

18:01.049 --> 18:03.517
I think he's just not used to it.

18:04.285 --> 18:05.650
Oh, right.

18:09.457 --> 18:11.721
Do you want to get any closer?

18:11.793 --> 18:13.124
You're going the wrong way.

18:14.262 --> 18:15.889
Stop the car, Howard.
I need to speak to Martha.

18:15.964 --> 18:17.158
- What?
- I need to speak to her.

18:17.232 --> 18:19.200
I need to speak to Martha.

18:19.267 --> 18:22.293
What about Alfie?
I need help with Uncle Alfie.

18:22.370 --> 18:25.430
- We're gonna be late!
- Ow! Could you please stop doing that?

18:33.247 --> 18:36.739
Thank you very much for coming.
It's lovely to see you. It won't be long.

18:37.618 --> 18:40.382
It's weird being back here.
I feel so out of it.

18:40.454 --> 18:43.355
Well, it's because you're living
in a different country, you lose touch.

18:43.423 --> 18:47.985
Who are these people, anyway?
I don't even recognize any of them.

18:48.061 --> 18:50.393
Who the hell's that guy?

18:50.864 --> 18:53.196
I have no idea. It's probably
a friend of Dad's from work or something.

18:53.267 --> 18:57.033
So listen, you're telling me
that I have to pay for this entire funeral?

18:57.104 --> 19:01.632
- I can't draw money out of thin air, Daniel.
- Oh, Jesus fucking Christ!

19:01.708 --> 19:05.371
- Daniel, how's everything going?
- Fine, thanks, Reverend Davidson.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.605
We're just waiting for everyone to arrive,
then we can get started.

19:07.680 --> 19:09.341
Great. Thank you.

19:10.016 --> 19:13.110
- Have you met my brother Robert?
- The writer, of course.

19:13.319 --> 19:16.720
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I've read several of your novels.

19:16.789 --> 19:19.758
- Really?
- You must be very proud of your brother.

19:19.825 --> 19:23.317
- Yes, very proud.
- And will you be making the eulogy today?

19:23.396 --> 19:25.990
No, Daniel will be doing the eulogy.

19:27.266 --> 19:28.528
Great.

19:28.868 --> 19:31.894
I'll just make sure I have everything I need.

19:35.808 --> 19:38.072
Listen, I think you should do the eulogy.

19:38.144 --> 19:40.738
Everyone's expecting you to do it,
and I'll just make a mess of it, anyway.

19:40.813 --> 19:42.440
Don't be silly. You'll be...

19:43.416 --> 19:45.007
You'll be fine.

19:46.318 --> 19:49.549
- All these can go through now.
- How's my little sister?

19:49.621 --> 19:53.523
Just very sad.
He was a wonderful husband, wasn't he?

19:53.591 --> 19:57.550
- So attentive. So devoted.
- Can I get you a cup of tea, Sandra?

19:57.629 --> 20:01.588
Tea can do many things, Jane,
but it can't bring back the dead.

20:07.405 --> 20:09.134
"My father was an exceptional man..."

20:09.207 --> 20:12.233
"My father...
My father was an exceptional man."

20:12.310 --> 20:14.972
Daniel, have you called yet
about the deposit?

20:15.046 --> 20:16.741
- No, I haven't yet, no.
- Why don't you give me the number,

20:16.815 --> 20:18.248
and I could do it?

20:18.316 --> 20:21.308
Jane, don't make it obvious, but you see
that guy standing by the table?

20:21.386 --> 20:24.650
See? Do you recognize him at all?
He's really staring at me.

20:24.722 --> 20:27.816
Are you listening to me at all?
We have to put the deposit on that flat

20:27.891 --> 20:30.985
- before it's too late. You understand?
- I know.

20:31.061 --> 20:32.426
All right.

20:43.073 --> 20:45.598
- Come on, get on with it.
- I am.

20:46.677 --> 20:48.838
You'll break it.

20:49.079 --> 20:51.047
Hurry up, we're late.

20:51.949 --> 20:53.211
Oh, God!

20:54.752 --> 20:57.346
"My father was an exceptional man."

20:58.288 --> 21:01.348
My God, that Katie's grown up a bit,
hasn't she?

21:01.425 --> 21:02.824
- What?
- Katie.

21:02.893 --> 21:05.918
She was like a little girl when I left,
and now she's...

21:06.029 --> 21:09.624
She's fit.
I might go and have a chat with her.

21:09.699 --> 21:11.860
Yeah, why don't you do that?

21:13.770 --> 21:16.068
"My father was an exceptional man."

21:16.139 --> 21:18.004
Hello there.

21:18.074 --> 21:19.336
Hello.

21:20.843 --> 21:23.676
I was really sorry to hear
about your father.

21:23.746 --> 21:24.735
Mmm.

21:25.281 --> 21:28.910
He always talked about you,
said you were a good son.

21:29.118 --> 21:30.483
Thank you.

21:31.687 --> 21:34.383
Did he ever mention me? Peter.

21:34.891 --> 21:37.587
Peter? No, I don't think so.
Were you friends with Dad?

21:37.660 --> 21:38.649
Mmm-hmm.

21:39.462 --> 21:42.920
Well, okay. Nice to meet you,
and thank you for coming.

21:48.370 --> 21:50.770
Come on.
Put your back into it.

21:50.839 --> 21:52.306
Jesus!

21:54.376 --> 21:58.005
- Push the bloody thing!
- I am pushing.

21:59.948 --> 22:02.178
"My father was an exceptional man.
He was born..."

22:02.250 --> 22:05.344
Daniel, I really think we should be
calling everyone in now

22:05.420 --> 22:07.183
- to start the service.
- Sure.

22:07.255 --> 22:09.780
Really, I'm only supposed to be here
until 3:00.

22:09.858 --> 22:12.292
Sure. Do you mind though if we wait
just five minutes for my Uncle Alfie?

22:12.360 --> 22:13.850
We really shouldn't start without him,
if possible.

22:13.929 --> 22:16.090
Of course, of course.

22:21.670 --> 22:22.659
I'll go...

22:30.344 --> 22:31.470
Look.

22:32.246 --> 22:34.009
Isn't it beautiful?

22:35.282 --> 22:37.716
Martha, could I have a word? Excuse me.

22:37.918 --> 22:41.081
- What? What is it?
- Okay, I have to tell you something.

22:41.155 --> 22:44.556
And I warn you in advance,
you're not gonna like it.

22:45.159 --> 22:46.786
Good to see you.
Thank you for coming as well.

22:46.861 --> 22:49.887
- Daniel. Hello, Robert.
- Hello, Uncle Victor.

22:50.431 --> 22:52.956
- Uncle Victor, how are you?
- Well...

22:54.135 --> 22:56.069
- Sad day.
- Yeah.

22:56.170 --> 22:59.606
- So, how are things in New York?
- Great. Really good, yeah.

22:59.673 --> 23:03.108
What's all this nonsense I hear about
you not doing the eulogy?

23:03.176 --> 23:06.942
- That's right. Daniel's gonna do the eulogy.
- Well, that's a damn shame.

23:07.013 --> 23:09.311
I mean, I'm sure Daniel will be fine,

23:09.382 --> 23:12.715
but after all,
you are the writer in the family.

23:13.186 --> 23:15.654
Will you just excuse me a second?

23:16.456 --> 23:19.050
So, any new books coming out?

23:19.125 --> 23:21.593
- I'll just get my things together.
- Sure.

23:21.661 --> 23:23.185
You all right?

23:23.263 --> 23:26.528
Every single bloody person
wants Robert to do the eulogy.

23:26.599 --> 23:29.830
He was my father, too, wasn't he? I'm just
as entitled to do the bloody eulogy.

23:29.903 --> 23:32.667
Yes, of course you are. Of course you are.

23:32.739 --> 23:35.833
And it's going to be the best bloody eulogy
anybody's ever heard.

23:35.909 --> 23:39.640
Did you hear? Apparently,
Robert won't be doing the eulogy.

23:43.749 --> 23:46.684
- What did you just say?
- I said the Valium you gave to Simon

23:46.752 --> 23:49.516
wasn't actually Valium.

23:49.588 --> 23:52.955
It's an hallucinogenic concoction.

23:53.025 --> 23:56.620
You know, stuff like acid, mescaline,
a little ketamine.

23:56.695 --> 23:57.992
This isn't funny, Troy.

23:58.063 --> 24:01.032
I'm not being funny.
Look at him. He's off his tits!

24:03.235 --> 24:05.795
You absolute little twat!

24:05.904 --> 24:08.031
What the hell are you doing
leaving this stuff around your flat?

24:08.106 --> 24:09.403
I didn't know someone was gonna take it,
did I?

24:09.474 --> 24:11.533
Who just goes into someone else's flat
and takes random pills?

24:11.610 --> 24:13.669
They were in a Valium bottle.

24:14.980 --> 24:16.743
Fuck, Troy!

24:16.815 --> 24:19.613
What the hell am I meant to do?
Should I tell him?

24:19.685 --> 24:23.176
No! Don't do that.
It'll just freak him out completely.

24:23.254 --> 24:25.279
I think we should just keep
a very close eye on him.

24:25.356 --> 24:26.846
Make sure he doesn't get out of control.

24:26.924 --> 24:30.416
And don't let him spend too long
talking to one person.

24:31.195 --> 24:32.184
Shit.

24:48.446 --> 24:50.346
Hey, Dad, how are you doing?

24:50.414 --> 24:51.881
- You're late.
- Hey, Dad.

24:51.949 --> 24:56.079
- Hi, Troy. You missing university today?
- Yeah, not to worry, though. I'll catch up.

24:56.153 --> 25:00.851
I know, I'm not worried about you.
I see you've brought your friend along.

25:00.924 --> 25:05.293
His name's Simon. Simon. And of course
I brought him along, he's my boyfriend.

25:05.362 --> 25:08.160
Martha. So good to see you.

25:08.231 --> 25:11.325
I'm so sorry, Aunt Sandra.
We're gonna miss Uncle Edward terribly.

25:11.401 --> 25:13.130
- Thank you.
- He was a great guy.

25:13.203 --> 25:15.171
Yes. Yes, he was. Thank you, Troy.

25:15.238 --> 25:18.298
Simon, this is my...

25:18.375 --> 25:20.935
I'm so sorry about the death.

25:23.513 --> 25:26.539
I'm so sorry.

25:27.183 --> 25:29.481
- Thank you.
- And everything.

25:29.552 --> 25:31.110
Come on, Simon.

25:45.100 --> 25:47.364
- What are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

25:47.436 --> 25:51.736
I can't leave, can I? Aunt Sandra'll
never speak to me again. Oh, shit!

25:54.143 --> 25:55.735
Hey, Martha.

26:12.795 --> 26:16.231
- Hey, you look nice.
- I'm dressed for a funeral.

26:16.298 --> 26:18.198
Yeah, but still.

26:18.801 --> 26:22.133
So, I heard about the engagement.
What's that about?

26:22.537 --> 26:25.267
Who told you that?
I haven't even told my dad.

26:25.340 --> 26:27.365
Is that the guy you're gonna marry?

26:27.442 --> 26:30.673
You're gonna spend
the rest of your life with him?

26:30.945 --> 26:32.606
Yep, that's him.

26:38.052 --> 26:41.852
- Simon?
- Martha. Martha.

26:41.923 --> 26:43.982
You're slow. Come on!

26:47.362 --> 26:50.798
- Any chance of a hand, Justin?
- Hey, lift it, lift it!

26:51.165 --> 26:53.690
Lift it. Lift it. You got to lift it.

26:53.768 --> 26:58.137
Hi, Daniel. Actually, there's something
I really wanted to talk to you about

26:58.206 --> 27:00.036
- when you have a moment.
- Okay, that's great.

27:00.107 --> 27:01.131
Do you mind if we do it later, though?

27:01.208 --> 27:02.869
'Cause my Uncle Alfie's just arrived and I...

27:03.110 --> 27:04.407
Sure.

27:05.879 --> 27:07.039
Up!

27:08.281 --> 27:09.578
Come on!

27:11.385 --> 27:12.750
Thank you, Justin.
Thank you so much, mate.

27:12.819 --> 27:14.548
Hope it wasn't too much hassle.

27:14.621 --> 27:17.249
- How are you, Uncle Alfie?
- Terrible.

27:31.204 --> 27:35.538
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you could all kindly take your seats.

27:35.609 --> 27:38.077
We're about to begin the service.

27:43.082 --> 27:44.515
Simon, please.

27:44.583 --> 27:49.282
Move. Move.
Don't start yet. Don't start. Move.

28:36.634 --> 28:38.659
Jesus, Howard, you stink!

28:40.839 --> 28:43.569
Family and friends.

28:43.775 --> 28:47.575
Maybe, that's because you left me
to deal with Uncle Alfie on my own.

28:47.645 --> 28:51.240
- Not to mention taking all the credit.
- Howard, can you please be quiet?

28:51.316 --> 28:54.649
And I'd like to start
with a favorite passage of Edward's

28:54.719 --> 28:56.516
from the King James Bible.

28:56.588 --> 29:00.353
It's the First Book of Samuel, Chapter 18.

29:02.259 --> 29:07.287
Actually, Martha, just so you know,
we had Uncle Alfie in the car with us,

29:07.364 --> 29:09.992
and you took my parking space,
and I had to push him

29:10.067 --> 29:14.060
about half a mile up a hill, by myself,
and we almost missed the service.

29:14.137 --> 29:15.468
That was my parking space.

29:15.539 --> 29:17.404
Listen, Howard, if you don't stop
poking me on the shoulder,

29:17.474 --> 29:19.738
I am going to take you
outside and kick the living shit out of you.

29:19.810 --> 29:21.243
- Do you understand me?
- What is going on?

29:21.311 --> 29:22.642
She stole my parking space.

29:22.713 --> 29:24.010
What do you mean
she stole your parking space?

29:24.081 --> 29:26.549
This is a funeral. Behave yourself.

29:28.819 --> 29:33.483
"Then Jonathan and David
made a covenant,

29:33.557 --> 29:36.526
"because he loved him as his own soul.

29:37.527 --> 29:41.054
"And it came to pass
that the soul of Jonathan

29:41.130 --> 29:46.261
"was knit with the soul of David.
And Jonathan stripped himself

29:46.335 --> 29:50.431
"of the robe that was upon him
and gave it to David,

29:51.107 --> 29:54.406
"and his garments, even to his sword,

29:54.777 --> 29:57.041
"and to his bow,

29:57.280 --> 29:59.544
"and to his girdle."

30:03.452 --> 30:07.616
And now, we'll have a few words
from Edward's son,

30:07.690 --> 30:08.987
Daniel.

30:22.771 --> 30:24.500
Hi, everyone.

30:24.573 --> 30:27.133
Thanks to so many of you for coming.

30:28.410 --> 30:30.970
I never realized Dad was so popular.

30:31.546 --> 30:34.037
In fact, it seems like he's got more friends
now that he's dead

30:34.115 --> 30:35.844
than when he was alive.

30:50.865 --> 30:53.231
"My father was an exceptional man.

30:53.301 --> 30:57.100
"He was born in 1938,
just a year before the war.

30:57.171 --> 30:59.765
"I'll never forget the time
when Dad took us to

30:59.840 --> 31:04.368
"the place where he grew up,
just near a town called Crawley in Sussex.

31:05.145 --> 31:09.445
"It's changed a lot over the years, what
with the expansion of Gatwick airport,

31:09.516 --> 31:12.314
"and it's actually become
something of a commuter town now,

31:12.386 --> 31:15.719
"partly because of its proximity to London.

31:17.157 --> 31:21.059
"But at the time when my dad was young,
it was really quite pastoral.

31:21.128 --> 31:23.153
"Lots of fields

31:24.131 --> 31:27.589
"and greenery, and Dad would roam
around the countryside for hours

31:27.668 --> 31:30.535
"with his close boyhood friend, Bob.

31:30.604 --> 31:34.700
"He told me how they spent
their summer days riding their bikes..."

31:35.109 --> 31:38.407
- Did you just see that?
- "...through the local cornfields..."

31:38.478 --> 31:41.970
- The coffin, it just moved.
- "...and swimming in the lake.

31:42.048 --> 31:43.379
"Dad's..."

31:43.983 --> 31:46.349
I'm telling you, I saw it move.

31:48.755 --> 31:51.451
"Dad's first job was working
after school as an apprentice,

31:53.593 --> 31:57.359
- "for an electrician named Mr. Thomson."
- There! It happened again!

31:57.430 --> 32:00.866
- Simon, settle down.
- I'm telling you, the coffin is moving!

32:00.933 --> 32:03.094
Simon, just calm down.

32:03.803 --> 32:08.001
Please, God, the coffin is moving,
I tell you!

32:09.075 --> 32:12.442
- There's someone alive in there!
- Simon, where are you going?

32:13.179 --> 32:15.738
What the hell is wrong with you all?

32:15.814 --> 32:18.009
- Don't you look at me like that!
- Simon.

32:18.083 --> 32:21.644
Can't you see? Open your eyes!

32:21.720 --> 32:26.419
There's someone moving around in there!
Can't you see?

32:26.491 --> 32:28.254
- Simon!
- What are you doing?

32:28.326 --> 32:31.295
Simon, stop that! Simon, don't touch that!

32:31.363 --> 32:32.853
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to let you out!

32:32.931 --> 32:34.489
What are you doing?

32:36.068 --> 32:37.592
Oh, God!

32:44.342 --> 32:46.902
Mum, it's all right, it's all right.

32:52.851 --> 32:54.284
It's okay.

32:55.920 --> 32:58.912
Put the kettle on. All right, Mum, all right.

32:59.523 --> 33:01.457
All right. Help me.

33:03.994 --> 33:07.395
That was unbelievable, wasn't it? All right.

33:08.065 --> 33:11.296
If you'd all like to have
some lovely tea and cake,

33:11.535 --> 33:14.163
we'll get back to you as soon as we can.

33:17.875 --> 33:20.207
- What the fuck was that about?
- Daniel, I am so sorry.

33:20.277 --> 33:22.472
- I'm so sorry.
- The coffin was moving.

33:22.546 --> 33:25.572
Just go back inside and I'll explain later.
I am so sorry.

33:25.649 --> 33:30.086
- There was a definite scratching sound.
- Sorry. Oh, God, please, please.

33:31.355 --> 33:32.947
- Are you all right?
- No.

33:33.023 --> 33:35.456
No, I haven't made the call
about the deposit yet.

33:38.194 --> 33:39.559
I'll kill him!

33:39.629 --> 33:42.427
- Just calm down.
- I'm going to kill him!

33:43.133 --> 33:44.361
- Dad, leave it.
- Leave it?

33:44.434 --> 33:46.527
- He's completely wrecked the funeral!
- It wasn't his fault.

33:46.603 --> 33:48.571
What do you mean it wasn't his fault?

33:48.638 --> 33:50.902
Your Aunt Sandra is in tatters.

33:50.974 --> 33:53.807
I want him out of here right this minute.
Is that clear?

33:53.877 --> 33:58.109
Tell me you will have nothing to do
with that ridiculous man ever again.

33:58.181 --> 33:59.512
I'm sorry.

33:59.582 --> 34:02.244
No, I can't do that.

34:02.318 --> 34:03.910
Why not?

34:04.621 --> 34:07.385
Because we're moving in together.

34:07.457 --> 34:09.118
Dear God.

34:09.192 --> 34:12.161
Have you completely lost your senses?

34:12.228 --> 34:13.626
He isn't actually like this.

34:13.695 --> 34:17.027
He had some drugs
and they made him act all weird.

34:17.099 --> 34:20.364
Drugs? What drugs?

34:25.007 --> 34:28.465
He took some Valium
and he had a bad reaction.

34:31.713 --> 34:33.681
- Valium?
- Yeah.

34:40.389 --> 34:42.687
We'll talk about this later.

34:50.098 --> 34:52.190
- Simon.
- Martha.

34:52.266 --> 34:53.630
Yeah, okay. Come and sit down.

34:54.135 --> 34:56.728
Thank you, Janet, I appreciate that.
That's for sure.

34:56.804 --> 34:59.432
- All right, mate?
- Hey. Hello, mate.

34:59.907 --> 35:01.204
That was awful. Wasn't it?

35:01.275 --> 35:03.368
Landing in front of your mum like that
like a dead trout.

35:03.444 --> 35:06.311
- Yeah, Howard, please. Come on.
- Yeah, sorry.

35:06.380 --> 35:10.407
It's just... You just never know
when it's gonna happen to you.

35:10.484 --> 35:15.114
That's all. It's like with me, I've got...
It's like a weird patch of skin.

35:15.189 --> 35:17.851
I've had that a couple of weeks.
I've absolutely no idea what that is.

35:17.925 --> 35:20.553
Why don't you show it to my Uncle Victor?
You know, he's a doctor.

35:20.628 --> 35:21.925
Yes.

35:23.898 --> 35:25.160
Hello.

35:26.133 --> 35:27.862
I swear I saw it moving.

35:28.102 --> 35:31.936
I saw it moving. No one else saw.
No one else saw.

35:32.006 --> 35:34.838
I swear I saw it moving.
I must be going mad.

35:34.908 --> 35:37.570
Why are my hands so big?

35:37.644 --> 35:41.341
Simon, listen to me.
I need to tell you something.

35:42.983 --> 35:46.146
You know I gave you some Valium earlier?

35:46.920 --> 35:49.548
- Yes.
- Well,

35:50.090 --> 35:56.256
it turns out
that it wasn't actually Valium at all.

35:57.731 --> 35:59.289
Mmm-hmm.

36:00.400 --> 36:02.925
- Can you hear me?
- Hello?

36:03.303 --> 36:05.294
- Do you think we can start again now?
- I believe we can, yes.

36:05.372 --> 36:08.000
- How are you feeling, Sandra?
- Much better, thank you.

36:09.943 --> 36:10.967
Hello, Doctor.

36:11.044 --> 36:13.807
I've got this skin discoloration.
I've had it for a couple of weeks now.

36:13.879 --> 36:14.937
It's just not going anywhere.

36:15.014 --> 36:17.744
Now, I know it's just a small patch,
but it's weird.

36:17.816 --> 36:18.874
It does look weird, doesn't it?

36:18.951 --> 36:21.215
Victor, I'm going back now.

36:21.520 --> 36:23.283
You should probably go
and see a dermatologist.

36:23.355 --> 36:25.084
Why, what do you think it is?

36:25.157 --> 36:27.717
Looks like some kind of pigment mutation.

36:27.793 --> 36:28.851
A pigment mutation?

36:28.928 --> 36:32.728
Could be an allergic reaction
to shellfish, nuts.

36:32.798 --> 36:34.459
Nuts? What kind of nuts?

36:34.533 --> 36:37.502
I don't know. Peanuts, almonds.
Excuse me.

36:42.675 --> 36:44.973
Do you see now?

36:45.644 --> 36:47.305
Yes.

36:50.182 --> 36:52.081
Hallucinogenic.

36:57.889 --> 37:01.450
Now, my advice is to relax
and just go with the flow.

37:01.526 --> 37:03.721
You know, try and enjoy it.

37:03.795 --> 37:05.228
You!

37:06.497 --> 37:07.555
Simon!

37:07.632 --> 37:12.001
- How long does it last?
- I don't know, about eight hours.

37:12.870 --> 37:15.600
- Eight hours of this?
- Simon, let go!

37:15.673 --> 37:16.901
You!

37:18.076 --> 37:21.341
- Simon?
- Oh, my God, I'm going to be sick!

37:21.412 --> 37:22.674
No.

37:24.482 --> 37:27.781
Simon, come back. Simon.

37:28.953 --> 37:31.443
- Hey, listen, Martha...
- Simon!

37:32.789 --> 37:35.724
Excuse me, sorry, he's going to be sick.
Excuse me.

37:35.792 --> 37:38.420
Sorry, mind out, mind out.
He's gonna be sick.

37:39.129 --> 37:41.427
Come up here. Quick.

37:46.269 --> 37:48.567
Do you want me... Simon?

37:52.342 --> 37:54.139
Simon, are you okay?

37:55.278 --> 37:56.540
Simon?

37:57.114 --> 37:59.082
Simon, let me in.

38:01.651 --> 38:03.516
- Simon.
- Martha.

38:04.254 --> 38:07.485
Did you happen to see a pill bottle? Shit!

38:07.557 --> 38:09.047
- Simon?
- Right.

38:09.126 --> 38:11.423
- Are you okay? Simon?
- Keep it together.

38:11.494 --> 38:13.894
Keep it together. You can do this.

38:14.030 --> 38:16.328
- Simon.
- You're Simon Smith.

38:17.600 --> 38:19.761
You're a solicitor.

38:19.835 --> 38:21.700
You're a solicitor.

38:22.505 --> 38:24.996
Eight hours. It's no problem.

38:25.074 --> 38:27.235
- Please, open the door.
- Eight hours he said.

38:27.309 --> 38:29.937
- Simon?
- Where's my watch?

38:30.780 --> 38:33.305
- Please open the door.
- It's already been...

38:34.350 --> 38:36.910
- I took Valium.
- Simon, open the door.

38:37.920 --> 38:40.081
- Seven hours to go.
- Simon?

38:40.156 --> 38:43.091
God, Jesus, fuck!

38:43.159 --> 38:44.285
Fuck!

38:44.860 --> 38:46.885
It's nothing to worry about. It's fine.

38:46.962 --> 38:48.452
Jesus fuck!

38:49.098 --> 38:51.088
Grief does strange things to people,
doesn't it?

38:51.166 --> 38:53.191
Yeah. Yeah.

38:53.268 --> 38:55.600
If you remember, I had something
I wanted to talk to you about.

38:55.670 --> 38:57.228
Oh, yes, yes.

38:57.305 --> 38:59.239
- Is there someplace quiet we can go?
- Sure.

39:27.469 --> 39:29.402
- Are you writing a book?
- Yes.

39:29.470 --> 39:31.631
- Like your brother.
- Well, different from my brother, but...

39:31.705 --> 39:33.730
- He's a great writer, isn't he?
- Yes, he is.

39:33.807 --> 39:35.297
So, anyway?

39:35.375 --> 39:39.903
Yes, actually, I have some photos
I wanted to show you.

39:40.080 --> 39:41.377
Okay.

39:41.615 --> 39:43.583
- May I?
- Sure.

39:46.153 --> 39:50.055
We became quite close, your father and I,
in the last few months.

39:50.124 --> 39:51.989
Ended up spending
quite a lot of time together.

39:52.059 --> 39:53.287
Right.

39:53.727 --> 39:56.287
Here's me and your father
in Regent's Park.

39:56.363 --> 39:57.523
Oh, yeah.

39:57.598 --> 40:01.364
Here we are on top
of one of those London buses.

40:01.435 --> 40:03.232
It's a terrible picture of me.

40:03.303 --> 40:07.364
- So, where did you and my dad meet?
- Just around.

40:11.210 --> 40:12.370
Hello?

40:12.945 --> 40:14.207
Simon.

40:15.681 --> 40:16.705
Are you all right?

40:16.782 --> 40:19.512
Wow. Yes.

40:20.052 --> 40:25.649
Yes, yes. Keep coming.
You, join the others.

40:26.259 --> 40:29.956
Join the others. Oh, you.

40:30.963 --> 40:37.425
Oh, here, yes. Here we are
at a fancy costume party in Kensington.

40:37.503 --> 40:41.132
That's your dad dressed up
as a Roman centurion.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.344
Sorry, in what capacity
were you actually friends with my dad?

40:51.416 --> 40:54.908
I mean, I don't mean to be...
But he never mentioned you to me.

40:54.986 --> 40:59.650
And yet you have all these pictures
where you're going around like you're...

41:29.119 --> 41:32.316
Oh, God. Oh, my God. No.

41:35.359 --> 41:37.827
Now, I know this must come
as quite a shock to you.

41:37.895 --> 41:40.420
I'm sure he would have told you himself,

41:40.497 --> 41:43.364
but I guess he wasn't sure
how you'd react.

41:43.434 --> 41:45.095
- Does my mother know about this?
- No.

41:45.169 --> 41:46.397
- No.
- No, no.

41:46.470 --> 41:49.496
And there's really no reason
why she should find out.

41:49.573 --> 41:52.303
Just as long as I get what's owed to me.

41:52.810 --> 41:53.902
What?

41:54.678 --> 41:57.203
Well, I think I deserve something.

41:58.115 --> 42:00.743
I mean, your father and I were lovers.

42:01.619 --> 42:04.679
No, he left me absolutely nothing
in his will.

42:05.823 --> 42:08.052
How do you think that makes me feel?

42:08.124 --> 42:11.116
I'll tell you how that makes me feel.
Cheap.

42:11.794 --> 42:13.455
Like a cheap slut.

42:14.230 --> 42:16.755
Don't you think I deserve something?

42:16.966 --> 42:18.593
What do you want?

42:19.602 --> 42:23.038
Well, I think about ï¿½15,000 should do it.

42:23.873 --> 42:25.397
ï¿½15,000?

42:26.042 --> 42:29.341
- I'm supposed to be buying a flat.
- Well, that's up to you.

42:29.412 --> 42:31.175
Hang on, you hang on a minute.

42:31.247 --> 42:33.010
You think you can come in here
and show me

42:33.082 --> 42:36.347
a few pictures of you and my dad on a bus
and that counts as proof?

42:36.419 --> 42:39.013
That's not fucking proof of anything.

42:40.223 --> 42:41.690
What is that?

42:42.225 --> 42:43.692
Oh, Jesus!

42:44.427 --> 42:48.021
Now, I don't want to,
but I will go out there

42:48.096 --> 42:50.394
and I will show these photographs
to every single person.

42:50.465 --> 42:52.899
Do you really want me to do that?

42:56.338 --> 42:59.068
You wait here. Wait here.

43:02.844 --> 43:06.302
Daniel, I was just telling George here
how when we were boys together,

43:06.381 --> 43:10.681
your dad used to love to
make us all go skinny-dipping.

43:14.589 --> 43:16.318
I think she's fine.

43:27.335 --> 43:30.099
Simon, open the door.

43:31.972 --> 43:33.837
Anything I can do to help?

43:33.908 --> 43:36.934
- Not really, thanks.
- You got it all under control?

43:37.511 --> 43:38.808
Simon?

43:39.780 --> 43:42.476
So what are you doing next weekend?
I've got a couple of tickets...

43:42.550 --> 43:44.484
Look, Justin,
I've got a lot on my plate right now,

43:44.552 --> 43:45.678
and I just can't deal with your shit.

43:45.753 --> 43:49.689
Now, can you please just go away?
Please?

43:52.993 --> 43:54.620
Simon?

43:59.066 --> 44:01.330
- Hi, Robert. Can I talk to you for a second?
- Not now.

44:01.402 --> 44:03.927
- Just give me five minutes.
- It's important. It's ever so important.

44:04.004 --> 44:05.937
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

44:06.406 --> 44:08.567
- What are you doing?
- Robert, listen.

44:13.713 --> 44:17.979
You know that guy from before
that we didn't recognize? That little guy,

44:18.051 --> 44:20.986
you know, the short guy, yeah?
I've just been with him in the study.

44:21.354 --> 44:25.484
- Yeah?
- And he showed me these pictures.

44:26.292 --> 44:28.192
- Yeah? Right.
- Of him and dad.

44:29.529 --> 44:33.124
- Of him and dad together.
- Right.

44:33.466 --> 44:35.229
Of him and Dad together
at parties in Kensington.

44:35.301 --> 44:36.768
Look, Daniel, is this going anywhere?

44:36.836 --> 44:41.432
- For God's sake, he was shagging dad!
- Fuck off!

44:45.344 --> 44:47.369
- Are you shitting me?
- No, I'm not shitting you, I'm telling you.

44:47.446 --> 44:49.937
He showed me the pictures. I feel sick.

44:50.015 --> 44:54.076
So, wait, wait, what are you saying?
That Dad was a gay?

44:54.420 --> 44:55.751
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

44:57.289 --> 44:59.917
- And he was cheating on Mum?
- Well, evidently.

45:00.192 --> 45:03.650
- With that little...
- Yes.

45:03.896 --> 45:07.195
I know it's a bombshell, but the concern
right now is that he wants money.

45:07.266 --> 45:08.563
- What do you mean he wants money?
- He wants money.

45:08.634 --> 45:10.829
- He wants ï¿½15,000.
- Tell him to go and fuck himself!

45:10.903 --> 45:12.803
No, you don't understand.
He's got the pictures.

45:12.871 --> 45:14.998
And if we don't give him the money,
he's gonna tell everybody here

45:15.073 --> 45:16.540
the most intimate details of their sex life.

45:16.608 --> 45:18.633
I don't wanna hear
the most intimate details of their sex life.

45:18.710 --> 45:21.304
Exactly. So what are we gonna do?

45:22.247 --> 45:25.238
- Oh, shit.
- Think, then.

45:26.584 --> 45:28.575
Okay, all right.

45:33.057 --> 45:35.992
This is a total fucking waste of time.
I don't know why I even bothered.

45:36.060 --> 45:38.290
I got dressed up and everything,
you know?

45:38.362 --> 45:40.330
I mean, how could she be more interested
in that idiot up there

45:40.398 --> 45:42.229
than she is in me?

45:42.300 --> 45:44.200
I'm telling you, Howard.
This world is severely fucked up.

45:44.268 --> 45:45.792
- Sounds really serious, doesn't it?
- What?

45:45.870 --> 45:47.963
Pigment mutation.

45:50.174 --> 45:53.109
Oh, will you taste this?
I think it's got almonds in it.

45:53.177 --> 45:55.304
- So?
- So? Daniel's uncle said I'm allergic

45:55.379 --> 45:56.710
- to almonds.
- Well, don't eat it.

45:56.781 --> 45:58.806
Go on, please. Be a mate. Taste it.
Tell me what you think.

45:58.883 --> 46:00.783
- No.
- Go on, try it.

46:00.852 --> 46:02.843
- I don't want to.
- Please. Come on, do me a favor.

46:02.920 --> 46:06.047
- Can't you just do me a favor?
- Please fuck off!

46:08.492 --> 46:10.460
You haven't seen a pill bottle lying around,
have you?

46:10.527 --> 46:12.188
Like a Valium pill bottle?

46:12.262 --> 46:14.662
- No.
- Shit. Shit. Shit.

46:26.977 --> 46:29.309
Shouldn't be long now.

46:36.887 --> 46:39.981
- Shall we go inside?
- In a minute.

46:47.663 --> 46:49.290
Doctor, you know you...

47:00.743 --> 47:05.840
Hello. Sorry about... Well, you know.

47:06.081 --> 47:08.049
- Thank you.
- Yeah, sorry.

47:08.517 --> 47:11.953
Oh, God, it must be terrible
losing a husband.

47:12.021 --> 47:14.819
Still, you're still so young. Relatively.

47:16.792 --> 47:21.786
Do you think you'll marry again?
Probably too soon to say, isn't it?

47:21.864 --> 47:25.492
God, it's just terrible, isn't it,
that people die? Awful.

47:25.567 --> 47:28.559
There was a guy that I know,
he got stabbed to death.

47:28.636 --> 47:32.094
And he called this guy's mother a moose.
The guy just...

47:32.173 --> 47:36.439
Just stabbed him right in the neck,
hit like a major artery.

47:36.511 --> 47:40.208
And there was blood, just...
You honestly would not believe how much

47:40.281 --> 47:44.547
just spurting absolutely everywhere.
And ridiculous thing is

47:44.619 --> 47:46.610
that the guy that did it told the police later

47:46.688 --> 47:49.452
he didn't even know what a moose was.

47:51.726 --> 47:56.629
Has that cake got almonds in it?
It's not important, doesn't matter.

48:00.068 --> 48:05.164
- Excuse me.
- Mmm. Nice talk.

48:15.749 --> 48:16.909
I just don't think
Mum can handle it.

48:16.984 --> 48:18.042
Let me rephrase the question.

48:18.118 --> 48:20.450
What do you mean, you think it's best
if I pay him the money?

48:20.821 --> 48:22.550
You've been living off Mum and Dad
for long enough.

48:22.623 --> 48:24.614
- You must have some money saved.
- I haven't been living...

48:24.691 --> 48:28.525
- I've paid for this entire funeral, Robert.
- Now, wait a second.

48:28.595 --> 48:30.620
How do you know
this guy isn't bullshitting?

48:34.901 --> 48:36.266
Oh, my God!

48:39.106 --> 48:43.007
- Simon?
- Simon.

48:44.877 --> 48:50.281
- Simon? Simon?
- Simon. Simon.

48:52.551 --> 48:56.544
- Simon.
- Simon.

48:57.556 --> 49:01.014
- Si?
- Mon.

49:10.703 --> 49:12.603
I think we're just about ready
to resume the service, so...

49:12.672 --> 49:14.401
Would you mind giving us five minutes?

49:14.473 --> 49:16.236
- Of course.
- Thanks.

49:19.311 --> 49:22.404
Hey, Danny, what is going on?

49:22.480 --> 49:24.880
Listen, I'm really, really sorry,
but I'm afraid our moving out plans

49:24.949 --> 49:27.110
are gonna have to be
put on hold just for a little while.

49:27.185 --> 49:29.176
- What do you mean? Why?
- I haven't got time to explain right now,

49:29.254 --> 49:31.313
but you know I wouldn't do this
unless I had a really good reason.

49:31.389 --> 49:34.950
- No. What's the reason?
- I can't explain right now. Okay.

49:44.235 --> 49:46.135
So you're the blackmailing prick.

49:47.505 --> 49:49.632
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
What are you doing with that?

49:49.708 --> 49:51.801
This is my manuscript.
This is not ready to be read by anyone.

49:51.876 --> 49:55.175
Well, you shouldn't leave it lying around,
Daniel, if you don't want people to read it.

49:55.246 --> 49:58.477
- This is my office!
- Guys, can we just get to the point?

49:58.650 --> 50:00.277
Fine by me.

50:03.921 --> 50:06.151
Fine. If I write you this check, okay,
that's the end of it. Yes?

50:06.223 --> 50:09.386
You give us the photos, then you stay out
of our lives forever, that's the deal, yeah?

50:09.460 --> 50:10.825
That's the deal.

50:27.511 --> 50:30.378
- Is that your first attempt?
- What?

50:30.447 --> 50:34.543
- The novel. That's your first novel, isn't it?
- Yeah. So?

50:34.718 --> 50:36.185
No, nothing.

50:37.354 --> 50:40.220
I tried writing once.
It didn't work for me, either.

50:41.858 --> 50:45.089
I think it's like a gift.
You either have it or you don't.

50:46.462 --> 50:50.660
It must be hard for you though, Daniel,
living up to your brother's reputation.

50:50.733 --> 50:54.100
You know, always living
in the shadow of a sibling like that.

50:54.704 --> 51:01.109
By the way, I read your latest novel.
Wow. Really good stuff.

51:01.878 --> 51:03.573
Thanks.

51:05.381 --> 51:07.178
Right, that's it.

51:08.050 --> 51:09.711
Daniel, what the hell are you doing?

51:09.786 --> 51:12.949
There's no way I'm giving this twat
a single penny of my money.

51:13.089 --> 51:16.957
- Don't be ridiculous.
- No. Why should I? Why should I?

51:17.026 --> 51:19.585
He comes in here on the day of
our father's funeral, tries to blackmail us,

51:19.661 --> 51:21.891
and then he slags off my novel.
Who does he think he is?

51:21.997 --> 51:24.329
- He has the photos.
- Let him show the photos, I don't care.

51:24.399 --> 51:27.596
- Daniel, it'll...
- No, Robert, I give up, okay? I give up.

51:27.669 --> 51:31.400
I can't take anymore. If that's what
he's gonna do, then fine. Let him do it.

51:34.409 --> 51:36.138
- Fine.
- Fine.

51:36.878 --> 51:42.407
- What? Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Please, get out of my way.

51:42.484 --> 51:45.510
- Let's just discuss this a minute.
- There is nothing to discuss.

51:46.922 --> 51:50.517
- Get out of my way! Get off!
- We can talk about this.

51:54.162 --> 51:55.925
Get up, Daniel! Daniel!

51:56.131 --> 51:57.120
Listen...

51:57.899 --> 51:59.593
What are you doing, Robert?
What are you doing?

51:59.667 --> 52:01.726
- Just get some rope or something.
- Rope? What do you mean rope?

52:01.802 --> 52:02.996
I haven't got any rope.

52:03.070 --> 52:06.335
Get some cord or something.
There, from the curtain.

52:07.708 --> 52:09.767
- Okay, here you go.
- Grab his legs.

52:12.479 --> 52:15.380
Oh, God, Jesus Christ, Robert,
this is a really bad idea.

52:15.883 --> 52:21.651
Twinkle, twinkle, little star

52:57.557 --> 53:00.492
- Fucking men.
- Tell me about it.

53:01.628 --> 53:05.189
- Daniel, get that tie. Just get that tie.
- Why?

53:05.331 --> 53:07.128
What am I supposed to do with a tie?

53:07.200 --> 53:08.690
Do you want everybody to know
our dad is a poof?

53:08.768 --> 53:10.861
- Of course I don't.
- Stuff it in his mouth, then.

53:10.937 --> 53:13.565
- This is ridiculous.
- Daniel, you know that cake...

53:13.640 --> 53:16.040
Jesus Christ, Howard.
Shut the fucking door!

53:16.109 --> 53:18.167
What's going on? Who's that?

53:18.243 --> 53:20.074
- He's having a fit.
- It's a seizure.

53:20.145 --> 53:23.080
Oh, God, really? I've just found
some Valium. Would that help?

53:23.181 --> 53:25.877
- Yeah, brilliant. Bring them here.
- How many?

53:25.951 --> 53:28.579
- I don't know, a handful.
- Really? Okay.

53:32.090 --> 53:33.921
Are they all in? Dropped one.

53:33.992 --> 53:38.088
Here. Open his mouth.
It's okay. It's all right.

53:39.031 --> 53:40.896
- You haven't seen a little brown pill bottle.
- Shut the door!

53:40.966 --> 53:43.491
Jesus Christ, Howard!
I told you to lock the fucking door!

53:43.568 --> 53:45.729
- You said, "Shut the fucking door."
- What's going on?

53:45.804 --> 53:49.171
- Oh, he's having a fit.
- A fit? Then why is he all tied up?

53:59.684 --> 54:02.676
Hello. Hello.

54:02.954 --> 54:04.353
Hang on, he's blackmailing you
over what?

54:04.422 --> 54:06.890
- It's not important right now.
- What do you mean it's not important?

54:06.958 --> 54:07.947
- It's personal.
- Well, why?

54:08.025 --> 54:10.016
He said it's personal. That's enough.

54:10.094 --> 54:12.221
Just trust us, okay?
This is not a good guy, you know.

54:12.296 --> 54:13.991
- We can explain later.
- So, what are we gonna do with him?

54:14.065 --> 54:16.898
- I don't know. What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

54:16.968 --> 54:18.435
What do you mean you don't know?

54:18.502 --> 54:20.094
How long are we gonna keep him
tied up for?

54:20.171 --> 54:22.901
How long's the Valium gonna last?

54:22.974 --> 54:24.134
- What?
- Valium?

54:24.208 --> 54:26.574
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah, I found those Valium.

54:26.644 --> 54:29.340
We gave him a few to calm him down.
Thank you.

54:30.014 --> 54:31.379
I think he's all right.

54:31.449 --> 54:34.179
- Oh, fuck!
- What?

54:36.253 --> 54:39.483
- What is it?
- Oh, fuck!

54:40.991 --> 54:42.185
What?

54:45.261 --> 54:50.289
- What? What?
- The thing is, it's not actually Valium.

54:50.367 --> 54:54.064
It's acid, mostly. A little ketamine.
Simon took one these by mistake,

54:54.137 --> 54:56.503
- that's why he's been off his box.
- What are you doing with this stuff?

54:56.573 --> 54:58.666
- They're for a friend!
- Hang on a minute.

54:58.742 --> 55:02.508
You're telling us that Martha's boyfriend,
who knocked over our father's coffin,

55:02.579 --> 55:03.944
had just one of these things?

55:04.014 --> 55:05.345
- And you gave him how many?
- Five.

55:05.415 --> 55:07.315
- Oh, Howard.
- What do you mean, "Oh, Howard"?

55:07.384 --> 55:10.319
- You cannot blame me for this!
- Poor bastard.

55:10.453 --> 55:11.442
We should call an ambulance.

55:11.521 --> 55:12.783
You can't do that. I'll be screwed!

55:12.856 --> 55:16.791
He's right. They're gonna turn up and find
that he's been force fed with hard drugs.

55:16.959 --> 55:18.221
Well, what's gonna happen?
Is he gonna die?

55:18.293 --> 55:19.282
Hmm?

55:19.528 --> 55:22.326
No. Shouldn't think so.

55:23.732 --> 55:25.199
Daniel?

55:28.170 --> 55:29.694
Robert?

55:30.372 --> 55:32.067
Be out in a minute, Mum.

55:32.174 --> 55:33.300
Daniel.

55:33.375 --> 55:37.038
- We need to go outside.
- You two stay here and look after him.

55:39.081 --> 55:40.446
Hang on, look after him?

55:40.516 --> 55:42.450
What do you mean look after him?
What are we supposed to do?

55:42.518 --> 55:45.749
Just make sure he doesn't escape.
Lock the door behind us.

55:46.822 --> 55:49.017
- Daniel?
- Hey, Mum. How's it going?

55:49.091 --> 55:50.285
Reverend Davidson needs to speak to you.

55:50.359 --> 55:52.827
We were wondering if we might be able
to resume the service now.

55:52.895 --> 55:54.988
Really, I'm only meant to be here
until 3:00.

55:55.064 --> 55:58.055
- That's great, but we need to have a chat.
- Would you give us another five minutes?

55:58.132 --> 56:00.259
- Sure.
- Is there a problem?

56:02.003 --> 56:03.095
Christ.

56:06.040 --> 56:08.565
Why didn't you just pay him
the fucking money?

56:10.178 --> 56:11.645
It's your fault.

56:15.116 --> 56:16.549
Where's my tea?

56:19.554 --> 56:23.081
- What's your problem?
- Women.

56:24.926 --> 56:30.387
Women, women, women.
Let me tell you something about women.

56:30.465 --> 56:34.424
When I was a young man, I used to go out
with the most beautiful woman

56:34.502 --> 56:39.165
in the village. I mean, she'd walk into
the room and everyone's eyes would turn.

56:39.239 --> 56:41.207
Everyone wanted to fuck her.

56:41.274 --> 56:44.266
And of course she liked the attention,
because...

56:45.946 --> 56:47.436
I need a shit.

56:53.019 --> 56:56.045
Shit, I can't believe
you gave him five!

56:56.123 --> 56:57.522
Don't blame me for this.

56:57.591 --> 56:59.582
Even if they were Valium,
you should never have given him five.

56:59.659 --> 57:01.251
- Don't you know anything?
- No, not about giving people...

57:08.268 --> 57:11.760
- Hello?
- I need the toilet.

57:13.273 --> 57:16.673
- Can you use the one upstairs?
- I'm in a wheelchair, you fucking idiot!

57:16.742 --> 57:21.270
How am I supposed to get up the stairs?
Open the door.

57:21.547 --> 57:23.447
Hang on a minute.

57:23.516 --> 57:25.347
What are we gonna do?
What are we gonna do?

57:25.417 --> 57:26.543
We'll stick him behind the couch.

57:28.020 --> 57:31.581
- Come on, quickly.
- Just looking for the key.

57:31.824 --> 57:34.657
Quick! Shut up!

57:37.663 --> 57:39.927
- Hurry up!
- Got it!

57:45.271 --> 57:49.139
- Hello.
- What the hell is wrong with you people?

57:50.009 --> 57:52.603
I'm about to shit in my trousers. Come on!

57:55.647 --> 57:58.673
- Hey.
- Oh, Justin, what do you want?

57:58.750 --> 58:00.377
I just wanna talk to you.

58:00.451 --> 58:02.419
Please don't make me
go through this again.

58:02.487 --> 58:05.012
What are you so afraid of, Martha?

58:05.089 --> 58:07.421
I know you feel the same way.
You can't fight what we had together.

58:07.492 --> 58:09.551
Justin, it was one night!
It was a massive mistake.

58:09.627 --> 58:13.188
I was drunk out of my mind.
You could have been a donkey!

58:13.331 --> 58:18.268
- What's this guy got that I don't have?
- Okay. Well for one thing, he's responsible.

58:18.336 --> 58:22.932
He's thoughtful. He's intelligent.
He's stable. Is that enough for you?

58:36.117 --> 58:38.415
Will you stop making out
that this is all my fault.

58:38.486 --> 58:39.976
I'm not the one who attacked the guy
and tied him up.

58:40.054 --> 58:42.648
- Someone had to look out for Mum.
- I've been looking out for Mum

58:42.724 --> 58:44.191
ever since you disappeared off
to New York

58:44.259 --> 58:46.227
to gallivant around
with your celebrity friends.

58:46.294 --> 58:50.663
You really are unbelievable.
You just can't get over it, can you?

58:50.732 --> 58:53.200
- Get over what?
- You're burning with jealousy

58:53.268 --> 58:56.533
because you've just spent three years
working on a novel,

58:56.604 --> 58:58.834
- and you won't even let anyone see it.
- Why should I? Why should I?

58:58.907 --> 58:59.931
What're you gonna do?

59:00.008 --> 59:03.774
- Are you gonna wait until you're dead...
- Rather than just a hack writing pulp...

59:03.845 --> 59:07.110
...and hope it's published posthumously?
...crap, self-righteously. Least my novel...

59:07.182 --> 59:09.412
- You're a pompous arsehole!
- And you are the most selfish...

59:09.484 --> 59:10.746
Daniel?

59:12.320 --> 59:15.186
Daniel, what is going on?
This is your father's funeral.

59:15.255 --> 59:19.589
- Not now, Jane. Jane, not now. Not now.
- Why are you acting like this?

59:22.262 --> 59:26.323
It's the flat, isn't it? It's the flat.
You don't want to go, do you?

59:26.400 --> 59:29.267
- You don't want to leave.
- Just tell her, Daniel.

59:29.336 --> 59:31.497
Just tell me what?

59:35.976 --> 59:40.037
Jane, you remember that short man
that I pointed out to you earlier?

59:40.113 --> 59:41.102
- Remember the short...
- Yeah.

59:41.181 --> 59:43.411
Well, it turns out that
he was having an affair with Dad,

59:43.483 --> 59:45.508
and now he's blackmailing us
into giving him ï¿½15,000,

59:45.586 --> 59:48.350
otherwise he's gonna show everyone
pictures of them doing stuff.

59:48.922 --> 59:50.651
- Sex stuff.
- Yeah.

59:52.693 --> 59:56.128
- Is this some sort of a sick joke?
- No, of course it's not a sick joke.

01:00:00.366 --> 01:00:02.357
Your dad was a gay?

01:00:02.969 --> 01:00:05.597
- Hurry up. Hurry up. Hurry up.
- I am.

01:00:06.005 --> 01:00:08.303
It's touch and go. Hurry up.

01:00:08.374 --> 01:00:10.501
- Quick, quick, quick!
- Give me that. Here.

01:00:10.576 --> 01:00:12.874
- Lift, lift. Help me, help me.
- All right. I am helping you.

01:00:12.945 --> 01:00:14.776
- Put your arms around me then.
- Lift me.

01:00:15.348 --> 01:00:18.681
Jesus Christ! Fucking hell!
You weigh a ton.

01:00:18.751 --> 01:00:20.946
- You got me? You got me?
- Yes, I've got you. Of course I've got you.

01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.419
- Quickly, quickly.
- All right.

01:00:22.488 --> 01:00:25.082
- I'm trying to see where the toilet is.
- Now get the trousers down.

01:00:25.157 --> 01:00:30.151
- Fuck. No. You do it, I'll hold you.
- How can I do it? I'm handicapped!

01:00:30.229 --> 01:00:32.992
- Get them down. Get them down.
- Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:00:33.064 --> 01:00:36.659
- Quick! Quick!
- I am! Right. Okay.

01:00:36.735 --> 01:00:42.765
Underpants. Move! Move!
Quick! Quick! It's touch and go!

01:00:42.841 --> 01:00:46.038
- Fuck! They're all down!
- It's touch and go. Am I there?

01:00:46.111 --> 01:00:48.045
- I don't know. Yes!
- Am I there?

01:00:48.113 --> 01:00:50.547
- Am I there? Are you sure?
- Yes. Sit down! Yes!

01:00:50.615 --> 01:00:55.211
Just sit down. Sit down.
Fuck, hang on, hang on.

01:00:55.287 --> 01:00:58.120
That's better.

01:01:07.732 --> 01:01:10.326
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Jesus, how much noise do you wanna...

01:01:10.402 --> 01:01:13.427
- Oh, God!
- Fucking hell! Fuck! Poo!

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:17.766
Fucking hell!

01:01:23.414 --> 01:01:24.403
Howard.

01:01:24.949 --> 01:01:26.382
Fuck! Fuck!

01:01:26.583 --> 01:01:29.108
- Fucking get it off!
- Howard.

01:01:29.186 --> 01:01:32.587
- Something, please, get it off! Get it off!
- Howard!

01:01:32.723 --> 01:01:37.888
- What? What?
- You've missed a bit.

01:01:42.866 --> 01:01:49.135
Oh, fuck! It's in my mouth!
Fucking hell! I'm gonna be sick!

01:01:50.774 --> 01:01:54.732
You'll have a lot more to worry about
than shit in your mouth if we get caught!

01:01:55.011 --> 01:01:57.445
- It's in my mouth!
- It's gone. Leave the tap on!

01:01:59.215 --> 01:02:02.082
I'm gonna be sick! I'm gonna be sick!
Please! Please!

01:02:15.498 --> 01:02:18.934
Check him. Touch him or something.
Check him.

01:02:19.836 --> 01:02:22.100
You all right, mate?

01:02:23.573 --> 01:02:24.699
Try it again.

01:02:26.809 --> 01:02:30.801
- Mate? Mate?
- Wake him up.

01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:35.045
- Mate? What's his name?
- I don't know.

01:02:36.518 --> 01:02:37.951
Try Philip.

01:02:46.595 --> 01:02:49.655
- Philip?
- Shake him.

01:02:54.336 --> 01:02:57.032
Philip? Wake up, mate.
You all right?

01:02:58.573 --> 01:02:59.562
Philip?

01:03:03.945 --> 01:03:09.542
Maybe it's not Philip.
Maybe it's something else. Pinch him.

01:03:09.618 --> 01:03:11.244
Please, just pinch him.

01:03:15.322 --> 01:03:16.448
Mate?

01:03:19.794 --> 01:03:22.126
Shit, I don't think he's breathing.

01:03:23.798 --> 01:03:24.822
What?

01:03:24.899 --> 01:03:27.993
No, he must be breathing,
he must be breathing.

01:03:40.414 --> 01:03:41.574
Shit!

01:03:42.650 --> 01:03:44.811
- Is he all right?
- No.

01:03:47.221 --> 01:03:48.313
He's fucking dead.

01:03:53.526 --> 01:03:55.858
That's it, then, isn't it? We're just gonna
have to give him our money.

01:03:55.929 --> 01:03:58.329
Well, it's not gonna be
quite as simple as that.

01:03:58.398 --> 01:03:59.422
Well, why not?

01:03:59.499 --> 01:04:02.491
Daniel refused to pay,
so now we're completely fucked.

01:04:02.569 --> 01:04:04.662
- Just shut up. Just shut up.
- What happened?

01:04:18.718 --> 01:04:21.619
Hi. Sorry. Thanks.

01:04:24.757 --> 01:04:27.123
Hi. Sorry, can I?

01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:32.990
Can I just come through? Thank you.

01:04:41.974 --> 01:04:44.272
What the hell are you grinning at, Howard?

01:04:46.778 --> 01:04:51.306
Wonder if I could ask you two
to pop into the study for a second?

01:04:55.787 --> 01:04:58.278
- Back soon.
- Yeah, okay.

01:05:01.927 --> 01:05:03.292
It's Howard.

01:05:11.035 --> 01:05:14.095
Hey, Jesus, what's this? What's this?

01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:17.201
- Call Uncle Victor.
- There's no point.

01:05:17.275 --> 01:05:19.766
- What do you mean there's no point?
- Look at him. He's stone dead.

01:05:24.549 --> 01:05:28.246
- What the hell did you do to him?
- We didn't do anything.

01:05:28.319 --> 01:05:31.755
- He hit his head on the corner.
- He hit his head on the corner?

01:05:31.856 --> 01:05:35.417
He hit his head. That's what happened.
Why, what do you think happened?

01:05:35.493 --> 01:05:38.189
This is really, really bad.
This is really, really, really bad.

01:05:38.262 --> 01:05:39.490
What are we gonna do?

01:05:39.564 --> 01:05:41.691
- Actually, I've really got to go.
- You are not going anywhere.

01:05:41.766 --> 01:05:43.825
Listen, I cannot go to prison.

01:05:43.901 --> 01:05:46.392
Do you have any idea what they do
to blokes like me in prison?

01:05:47.138 --> 01:05:50.265
- I cannot go to prison.
- Howard, just calm down.

01:05:59.149 --> 01:06:03.449
Now, nobody here knows who this guy is,
right? They don't even know his name.

01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:05.715
They probably didn't even notice him.

01:06:05.789 --> 01:06:07.620
They didn't notice him?
He's four fucking feet tall!

01:06:08.792 --> 01:06:12.193
All right, so we just get rid of the body.
It's like he came and left.

01:06:12.963 --> 01:06:15.989
Let's get rid of the body?
What are you talking about?

01:06:16.066 --> 01:06:19.035
Look at us. What do we know about
getting rid of bodies?

01:06:19.102 --> 01:06:22.094
What are you gonna do? Are you gonna
throw him out with the rubbish?

01:06:24.007 --> 01:06:26.567
Did any of you happen to notice
the size of Uncle Eddie's coffin?

01:06:29.812 --> 01:06:32.747
Are you suggesting that we bury him
with my father?

01:06:33.549 --> 01:06:36.450
Why not? I mean,
it's not like he's gonna know, is he?

01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:39.517
That's not the point.

01:06:42.424 --> 01:06:45.860
You have to admit it makes sense, Daniel.
Coffin's there.

01:06:45.928 --> 01:06:49.329
Hole in the ground's there.
He'll be gone. Finished. End of story.

01:06:49.398 --> 01:06:52.663
Unless you've got a better suggestion.

01:07:03.279 --> 01:07:04.541
No, I mean, come on, look.

01:07:04.613 --> 01:07:07.911
I mean, you gotta do whatever it is
in life that fires you up the most.

01:07:07.982 --> 01:07:11.975
Yes, but maybe I don't consider life
anymore as being about me, me, me.

01:07:12.053 --> 01:07:15.614
Maybe I've discovered there's something
outside of myself that I care about,

01:07:15.690 --> 01:07:17.851
and maybe you should too, Justin.

01:07:17.925 --> 01:07:21.691
Hey, well, that's a bit harsh,
'cause, look, I mean, I care about you.

01:07:21.763 --> 01:07:23.754
No, Justin, you care about you.

01:07:23.831 --> 01:07:26.766
You care about me in relation to
how I affect you. There's a difference.

01:07:26.834 --> 01:07:28.028
Uh-uh.

01:07:28.102 --> 01:07:31.435
No, that's not true, Martha.

01:07:31.806 --> 01:07:35.264
Justin, I don't know
what else I need to tell you.

01:07:36.177 --> 01:07:38.236
- I love you, Martha.
- No, Justin, you don't.

01:07:43.451 --> 01:07:45.385
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- Simon!

01:07:46.553 --> 01:07:47.713
Simon!

01:07:48.455 --> 01:07:51.015
Simon! Simon,
what the hell are you doing?

01:07:51.091 --> 01:07:53.218
Get back in here
and put your clothes on this instant!

01:07:53.293 --> 01:07:56.694
- I saw you kissing him.
- I wasn't kissing him, I promise you.

01:07:56.763 --> 01:07:59.197
What are you doing?
We're at a bloody funeral!

01:07:59.266 --> 01:08:01.632
- I'll jump.
- Simon, don't be silly.

01:08:01.702 --> 01:08:04.569
- I'm gonna jump right now, I swear to you!
- Don't be silly, Simon.

01:08:04.638 --> 01:08:08.005
Don't be silly.
Remember, you've got drugs in you.

01:08:08.075 --> 01:08:13.138
Just calm down. Simon, look at me.
Justin, will you get the fuck out of here?

01:08:13.347 --> 01:08:16.874
- Simon, please...
- No, I'm going to do it. I'm going...

01:08:17.850 --> 01:08:18.875
- Simon, look at me.
- I swear I am!

01:08:18.952 --> 01:08:22.011
Simon. Please, just calm down.
Simon, please.

01:08:22.089 --> 01:08:23.852
I'm gonna jump. I'm gonna jump.

01:08:24.358 --> 01:08:28.316
I'm going to jump. I'm going to jump.
I'm going to jump!

01:08:29.362 --> 01:08:32.126
- This is impossible. We cannot do it.
- Just shut up.

01:08:32.198 --> 01:08:33.358
Howard? Is that you?

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.295
- Shit!
- Howard, are you in there?

01:08:36.368 --> 01:08:37.358
Yeah.

01:08:38.237 --> 01:08:42.799
Quick, get him in the bathroom.
You've gotta move the table.

01:08:43.542 --> 01:08:44.736
Howard?

01:08:50.716 --> 01:08:52.411
- Oh, shit!
- What's that?

01:08:53.853 --> 01:08:56.287
Howard, what the fuck
is Uncle Alfie doing on the toilet?

01:08:56.354 --> 01:08:58.515
- I forgot.
- How could you forget?

01:08:58.591 --> 01:09:01.856
- What is wrong with you?
- Open the bloody door.

01:09:03.194 --> 01:09:04.560
- What is it?
- Hey, Daniel.

01:09:04.630 --> 01:09:06.028
- Where's Howard?
- I'm here.

01:09:06.096 --> 01:09:09.692
Howard, come see this.
Simon's totally fucking lost it.

01:09:12.670 --> 01:09:14.331
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

01:09:14.406 --> 01:09:17.671
Listen, Simon's on the roof.
He's totally fucking starkers,

01:09:17.742 --> 01:09:20.233
- and he's threatening to jump.
- Oh, Christ!

01:09:20.310 --> 01:09:22.541
- Where are you going?
- I have to go out there.

01:09:22.613 --> 01:09:25.845
- If he jumps, I'm fucked!
- Wait here.

01:09:27.585 --> 01:09:29.051
Come on, hurry up.

01:09:35.593 --> 01:09:37.527
Simon,
you are not going to jump.

01:09:37.595 --> 01:09:40.325
No, I'm not listening to you.

01:09:40.398 --> 01:09:42.866
Simon, get back in here.

01:09:43.835 --> 01:09:46.325
Simon, come inside,
we'll have a cup of tea.

01:09:46.837 --> 01:09:50.933
- No!
- Simon! Simon!

01:09:52.876 --> 01:09:55.538
Simon? Simon?

01:09:57.948 --> 01:09:59.210
Simon?

01:10:05.756 --> 01:10:06.882
Simon!

01:10:06.957 --> 01:10:09.221
Martha! What the hell are you doing?

01:10:09.993 --> 01:10:10.982
Simon!

01:10:13.363 --> 01:10:14.955
Stay there.

01:10:16.767 --> 01:10:17.791
Martha!

01:10:18.936 --> 01:10:19.960
Get down from there!

01:10:23.207 --> 01:10:24.673
- What's happening?
- I think I can get rid of this guy,

01:10:24.740 --> 01:10:27.402
but I need you to stay outside
and make sure nobody comes in.

01:10:27.477 --> 01:10:28.466
Okay.

01:10:29.545 --> 01:10:30.534
Martha!

01:10:35.718 --> 01:10:37.845
- Who is it?
- It's Daniel. Let me in.

01:10:38.087 --> 01:10:40.112
Everyone's in the garden.
Quick, we have to move the body now!

01:10:40.223 --> 01:10:41.212
Brilliant.

01:10:46.562 --> 01:10:48.757
Okay. Quick. Quick.

01:10:48.831 --> 01:10:50.822
Howard, Howard, stay here.
Make sure no one comes in.

01:10:50.900 --> 01:10:53.027
Okay, okay.

01:10:55.338 --> 01:10:57.932
Hello, Reverend. Hi. Hi.

01:10:58.941 --> 01:11:00.966
How is God today?

01:11:07.849 --> 01:11:09.680
- God, he's a funny one, isn't he?
- Excuse me.

01:11:09.751 --> 01:11:11.343
Yeah, okay. I'm sorry.

01:11:12.754 --> 01:11:15.450
Daniel, we have to do this right.

01:11:20.395 --> 01:11:23.387
I just wanted to ask you about religion
and how I could become a priest

01:11:23.465 --> 01:11:25.433
if I wanted to, because I've seen you today
and you're amazing.

01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:27.127
I'm delighted to hear that.

01:11:28.136 --> 01:11:30.764
Oh, God, we can't leave him like that.

01:11:35.810 --> 01:11:38.210
You know, in a strange way, maybe
this is what Dad would have wanted.

01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.373
For God's sake, Robert,
can you not take anything seriously?

01:11:40.916 --> 01:11:44.544
On Sundays, is it true

01:11:44.618 --> 01:11:48.486
that wine is sweeter?

01:11:50.124 --> 01:11:52.991
- Or not?
- Listen, we'll deal with this later on.

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:55.528
- I need to get to the phone.
- Yeah, but...

01:11:58.032 --> 01:11:59.590
Why do you say
I can't take anything seriously?

01:11:59.667 --> 01:12:02.329
I'll tell you why. Because you disappear
halfway around the world

01:12:02.403 --> 01:12:04.234
without hardly ever coming back
to see your parents.

01:12:04.305 --> 01:12:06.865
Because you spend your last remaining
money on a first-class plane ticket

01:12:06.941 --> 01:12:08.909
when you know you were
supposed to give me half for the funeral.

01:12:08.976 --> 01:12:10.967
And because you live your life
like you're on a fairground ride,

01:12:11.045 --> 01:12:12.603
and because you have never, ever, ever

01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:15.012
given a shit about anybody
except yourself.

01:12:15.816 --> 01:12:18.614
No one's doing anything about this
disturbed young man on the roof.

01:12:18.686 --> 01:12:22.452
I have a confession to make.
I have these thoughts about

01:12:22.523 --> 01:12:26.458
- pushing a pen up my bum!
- I beg your pardon?

01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:32.762
Simon, this is really dangerous.
Please.

01:12:33.366 --> 01:12:37.393
- I saw you.
- Stay there.

01:12:53.119 --> 01:12:57.920
You know, I'll never be good enough.

01:12:59.025 --> 01:13:03.723
Not for your dad, not for you. I'll never be
rich enough. I'll never be cool enough.

01:13:03.795 --> 01:13:06.559
Simon, stop talking this nonsense
and just come inside.

01:13:06.632 --> 01:13:08.725
No, you go back inside!

01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:10.791
- Come with me.
- No. Why?

01:13:15.140 --> 01:13:17.574
Because we're gonna have a baby.

01:13:21.480 --> 01:13:22.742
What?

01:13:23.882 --> 01:13:27.045
We're gonna have a child together.

01:13:31.823 --> 01:13:33.017
You're pregnant?

01:13:33.091 --> 01:13:36.026
And I won't be able to do it without you.

01:14:02.987 --> 01:14:05.387
- What's that? Excuse me.
- I don't know. Go look.

01:14:11.729 --> 01:14:13.196
Bye, Dad.

01:14:25.075 --> 01:14:27.566
We're gonna have a baby!

01:14:29.579 --> 01:14:31.809
Jesus Christ!

01:14:37.721 --> 01:14:39.916
Hey, everyone, Simon's off the roof!

01:14:41.491 --> 01:14:43.083
I'm going to kill him.

01:14:56.372 --> 01:14:59.569
- Hey, has he gone?
- Yeah.

01:14:59.642 --> 01:15:01.973
Thank God.

01:15:04.046 --> 01:15:05.775
Careful, careful.

01:15:08.884 --> 01:15:11.444
- Thank you.
- Martha.

01:15:11.553 --> 01:15:13.885
Martha, will you open this door?

01:15:17.159 --> 01:15:22.256
Thank God you're safe. You idiot!
What were you thinking?

01:15:22.331 --> 01:15:24.629
I want you to stay away
from my daughter.

01:15:24.700 --> 01:15:26.497
- Look, Dad...
- Martha, stay out of this.

01:15:26.568 --> 01:15:29.196
- Dad, we're getting married.
- You're what?

01:15:29.271 --> 01:15:32.035
We're getting married.

01:15:33.642 --> 01:15:37.601
Martha, you don't have to marry this man
just because you're pregnant.

01:15:37.679 --> 01:15:41.478
- We can deal with this, Martha.
- I'm marrying him because I love him.

01:15:41.983 --> 01:15:43.712
- You can't.
- Yes, I can.

01:15:43.785 --> 01:15:45.446
This is my life, and this is my choice,

01:15:45.520 --> 01:15:49.012
and I'm sorry if you don't like it,
but that's just tough.

01:15:50.625 --> 01:15:54.823
And I will tell you something else.
If you don't sort out your attitude,

01:15:54.896 --> 01:15:58.662
you're gonna end up
a very lonely, bitter old man.

01:15:59.834 --> 01:16:01.802
- Simon.
- All right.

01:16:05.540 --> 01:16:06.632
Dad!

01:16:09.544 --> 01:16:12.809
Oh, darling,
we really must start again now.

01:16:12.880 --> 01:16:15.906
- Daniel, have you seen Uncle Alfie?
- Shit!

01:16:29.963 --> 01:16:32.454
- What the hell is going on in there?
- I'm so sorry.

01:16:32.532 --> 01:16:35.262
Never mind that. What about that
dead body you were dragging over here?

01:16:35.335 --> 01:16:37.200
- What dead body?
- Oh, don't fuck with me!

01:16:37.270 --> 01:16:39.670
- I saw a dead body!
- Uncle Alfie must have dropped off.

01:16:39.739 --> 01:16:44.142
Get me the hell off of this fucking toilet!

01:16:44.678 --> 01:16:45.975
Here they come.

01:16:55.822 --> 01:16:57.483
Did you hear that? She's having a kid.

01:16:57.557 --> 01:16:59.581
I never would've done anything
if I'd known she was having a kid.

01:16:59.658 --> 01:17:00.716
I thought you were in love with her.

01:17:00.793 --> 01:17:03.557
Yeah, but can you imagine me
bringing up a kid?

01:17:03.629 --> 01:17:05.290
- No.
- Exactly.

01:17:05.364 --> 01:17:07.798
- How's your skin thing?
- Oh, that. Probably nothing.

01:17:07.867 --> 01:17:11.803
To be honest, I'm more concerned about
having had Uncle Alfie's shit in my mouth.

01:17:23.215 --> 01:17:25.809
The door opened, I saw him.
He was dead.

01:17:25.885 --> 01:17:30.083
Why won't you listen?
I tell you, I saw the guy. He was dead.

01:17:30.155 --> 01:17:32.623
I know you did, Uncle Alfie.
We all did.

01:17:32.691 --> 01:17:34.886
No, no, no, in the bathroom.

01:17:34.960 --> 01:17:36.052
The door opened. I saw...

01:17:36.128 --> 01:17:38.755
I can't believe what a nightmare
today has been.

01:17:38.830 --> 01:17:41.025
- It's been sort of exciting, hasn't it?
- What?

01:17:41.099 --> 01:17:43.761
- For a funeral, I mean, it's been...
- Listen, about the flat,

01:17:43.835 --> 01:17:47.794
- I promise that I will make the call. I will.
- We'll work it out.

01:17:49.641 --> 01:17:51.370
Right, we're really going to have to
whiz through this now.

01:17:51.442 --> 01:17:52.568
Sure, let's go.

01:17:52.644 --> 01:17:54.635
- Do you want to have the casket open...
- No. No.

01:17:54.712 --> 01:17:55.770
Fine. That's fine.

01:17:55.847 --> 01:17:58.941
Right. Sit down, everybody.
As quick as you can. We're ready to go.

01:17:59.417 --> 01:18:03.148
Come along. Come on, come on.
Come on. Right.

01:18:04.455 --> 01:18:08.448
Quickly! Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:18:09.460 --> 01:18:12.293
Come on, come on, come on!

01:18:13.932 --> 01:18:16.833
Well, I'd like to apologize on behalf
of the family for all of the distractions.

01:18:16.901 --> 01:18:19.368
I hope that everyone is settled
and ready to continue with the service,

01:18:19.436 --> 01:18:21.131
and Daniel would like to say
a few words about his father.

01:18:21.204 --> 01:18:23.434
Off you go, Daniel. Quickly.

01:18:40.123 --> 01:18:44.025
"My father was an exceptional man."

01:19:04.413 --> 01:19:07.905
"My father was an exceptional man.

01:19:18.127 --> 01:19:21.619
"He was born in 1938, just a year before
the war, and I'll never forget the..."

01:19:25.267 --> 01:19:28.236
- What the hell is going on?
- There's someone in there!

01:19:28.304 --> 01:19:30.033
I knew it!

01:19:39.214 --> 01:19:42.308
What the hell are you doing
in my dad's coffin?

01:19:44.819 --> 01:19:47.913
- Edward!
- No! No!

01:19:48.156 --> 01:19:49.623
No!

01:19:49.691 --> 01:19:52.353
Edward! Edward!

01:19:57.565 --> 01:19:59.430
No!

01:20:12.480 --> 01:20:15.916
You little bastard!
He's been shagging you, you bastard.

01:20:18.852 --> 01:20:20.285
Oh, dear God!

01:20:20.621 --> 01:20:23.317
My father was an exceptional man!

01:20:47.748 --> 01:20:52.447
He may not have been a perfect man,
but he was a good man.

01:20:54.488 --> 01:20:55.852
And he loved us.

01:21:01.094 --> 01:21:03.528
All I wanted to do today was to give him
a dignified send-off.

01:21:03.596 --> 01:21:05.621
Is that really so much to ask?

01:21:12.171 --> 01:21:13.160
So...

01:21:16.042 --> 01:21:17.304
Maybe...

01:21:19.745 --> 01:21:25.377
Maybe he had some things he liked to do.
Life isn't simple. It's complicated.

01:21:28.521 --> 01:21:34.756
We're all just thrown in here together
in a world full of chaos and confusion,

01:21:36.061 --> 01:21:40.930
a world full of questions and no answers.
Death always lingering around the corner.

01:21:40.999 --> 01:21:42.591
And we do our best.

01:21:45.237 --> 01:21:49.367
We can only do our best,
and my dad did his best.

01:22:02.287 --> 01:22:04.755
He always tried to tell me that
you have to go for what you want in life,

01:22:04.823 --> 01:22:06.415
because you never know
how long you're gonna be here.

01:22:06.491 --> 01:22:11.258
And whether you succeed or you fail,

01:22:11.329 --> 01:22:14.127
the most important thing is to have tried.

01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:18.568
A parent can only guide you
in the right direction.

01:22:18.636 --> 01:22:21.469
In the end, you have to learn for yourself.

01:22:26.710 --> 01:22:28.905
You have to grow up yourself.

01:22:34.818 --> 01:22:36.911
So when you all leave here today,

01:22:38.355 --> 01:22:42.189
I would like you to remember my father
for who he really was,

01:22:43.928 --> 01:22:46.954
a decent, loving man.

01:22:51.635 --> 01:22:55.764
If only we could be as giving
and as generous and as

01:22:55.838 --> 01:23:02.073
understanding as my father was,
then the world would be a far better place.

01:23:41.917 --> 01:23:44.886
Hey. How's Mum doing?

01:23:46.888 --> 01:23:48.651
She'll survive.

01:23:52.094 --> 01:23:55.257
On the positive side,
now she knows why it's been so long

01:23:55.330 --> 01:23:57.059
since she and Dad had sex.

01:24:01.970 --> 01:24:04.962
I asked her to come to New York with me
for a while.

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.876
Give you and Jane a chance
to breathe a bit, you know.

01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:13.412
- Get your flat.
- Wow.

01:24:14.015 --> 01:24:15.004
Wow.

01:24:16.917 --> 01:24:22.150
That was a pretty good speech you gave,
by the way. It was really

01:24:27.128 --> 01:24:30.859
- impressive.
- Thanks.

01:24:35.970 --> 01:24:40.805
Maybe when you've got time, you
wouldn't mind taking a look at my novel.

01:24:41.342 --> 01:24:44.334
I'd love to, yeah.

01:24:47.782 --> 01:24:49.682
Hey.
Hey.

01:24:51.652 --> 01:24:53.812
I'm exhausted, actually.

01:24:53.887 --> 01:24:57.379
Uncle Alfie keeps going on
about the body in the bathroom.

01:24:57.457 --> 01:24:59.687
- I think it's best if he stays here tonight.
- Yeah.

01:24:59.759 --> 01:25:02.887
- Do you think he'll be okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, he'll be fine.

01:25:02.962 --> 01:25:05.760
I found him a couple of Valium,
put him to bed.

01:25:09.302 --> 01:25:12.135
Everything's so fucking green!

01:25:33.525 --> 01:25:35.186
And keep rolling.

01:25:36.028 --> 01:25:37.757
What was that?

01:25:45.003 --> 01:25:46.664
Cut, print, check it.

01:25:53.379 --> 01:25:58.112
- That is so low. That's so low.
- What? Come on! You said cut!

01:25:58.751 --> 01:26:02.209
Daniel, have... Oh, you bastard!

01:26:03.155 --> 01:26:04.622
Jane Asher!
Sorry.

01:26:07.292 --> 01:26:10.159
Do that... Do that again, sorry.
Do that again, sorry.

01:26:13.664 --> 01:26:16.633
Cut. Check it.
Very nice, though, guys.

01:26:20.872 --> 01:26:22.840
Print. Check it.

01:26:24.976 --> 01:26:28.639
Cut! Cut. Print it.

01:26:30.815 --> 01:26:32.874
That was very good.

01:26:34.819 --> 01:26:37.049
Anything else
you wanna do, Peter?

01:26:37.522 --> 01:26:38.716
That's a cut.

01:26:39.857 --> 01:26:40.949
Check it.
