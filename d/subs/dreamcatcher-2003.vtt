02:41.413 --> 02:45.611
Carl's Jr. has this $6 burger,
which really only costs $3.95...

02:45.773 --> 02:47.889
...so you think
you're getting some deal...

02:48.053 --> 02:51.728
...but the truth is, it may be
the best franchise burger out there.

02:52.213 --> 02:55.410
I went there yesterday
and ordered three.

02:55.573 --> 02:58.610
By golly, those suckers
almost filled me up.

02:58.773 --> 03:02.812
When I got home,
I still had to have a box of Eggos...

03:02.973 --> 03:05.885
...but that doesn't take away
from Carl's achievement.

03:06.053 --> 03:07.771
I mean, here's a guy
who's got to go...

03:07.933 --> 03:10.686
-...through life as Carl Junior, right?
Barry?

03:10.853 --> 03:15.131
Like he can never get out of the shadow
of his dad, the original Carl, I guess.

03:15.653 --> 03:19.282
Do you think this eating has to do
with thinking you killed your mother?

03:19.493 --> 03:22.166
That you're eating yourself
to death as punishment?

03:23.093 --> 03:27.132
-You do think you killed her, right?
-I never said that.

03:27.573 --> 03:30.406
She called out to you
from that big, fancy oak bed.

03:30.573 --> 03:33.929
-She said she was having chest pain.
-I never told you any of that!

03:34.093 --> 03:37.244
-How could you know this?
-She begged you to dial 911.

03:37.493 --> 03:40.849
But she was always calling out
for you, wasn't she, Barry?

03:41.613 --> 03:46.368
You weren't there. How could
you know what happened? How?

03:48.533 --> 03:53.004
-Doesn't matter. Stop blaming yourself.
-Doesn't matter.

03:53.173 --> 03:57.007
If you don't, you'll eat yourself
into an early grave for no reason.

03:57.173 --> 03:59.084
You're looking in my head!
Stop it!

03:59.293 --> 04:02.091
-Don't look in there.
-You don't have to do it, Barry.

04:02.573 --> 04:03.722
Leave me alone!

04:05.973 --> 04:07.804
It wasn't your fault.

04:52.733 --> 04:54.246
Jonesy?

05:07.533 --> 05:09.125
Ah!

05:17.773 --> 05:19.889
Hey, how are you doing, Henry?

05:20.053 --> 05:21.406
What's that you say?

05:21.573 --> 05:23.450
Are you going deaf?
How are you doing?

05:23.613 --> 05:27.003
You know. SSDD.

05:27.173 --> 05:28.526
Well, yeah, of course.

05:28.853 --> 05:33.244
Hey, I was thinking if you were free
this weekend we might go see Duddits.

05:33.453 --> 05:36.843
Yeah, absolutely.
He's been on my mind a lot too.

05:37.013 --> 05:38.924
It's been a long time.

05:39.133 --> 05:41.044
Yeah. It's open!

05:42.253 --> 05:46.849
I gotta go. I got a thing here.
I'll see you Saturday.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.002
Yeah, right.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.610
See you Saturday.

06:01.813 --> 06:04.202
So, Mr. Defuniak...

06:05.293 --> 06:08.205
...do you know we're both
escapees from Maine?

06:11.573 --> 06:13.325
You're from Pittsfield.

06:20.013 --> 06:24.245
Know what happens to scholarship
students caught cheating on exams?

06:36.093 --> 06:39.881
You had the flu that day, didn't you,
David? You didn't take the exam?

06:41.253 --> 06:47.010
You missed the test. And since you were
ill, why not write me an essay instead?

06:47.173 --> 06:50.165
3000 words on the short-term results
of the Norman Conquest.

06:50.333 --> 06:52.051
-Go get started.
-Yes, sir.

06:52.213 --> 06:54.602
Better to be from Pittsfield
than go back to it.

06:54.773 --> 06:56.445
Thank you, sir.

07:00.653 --> 07:03.725
How did you know?
You weren't even there that day.

07:06.933 --> 07:09.003
Sometimes I just know.

07:26.653 --> 07:28.052
Hello.

07:33.173 --> 07:34.401
This probably won't work.

07:34.573 --> 07:38.282
Never start like that with a car salesman.
We love challenges. Pete Moore.

07:38.733 --> 07:42.282
In one hour I'm showing a house in
Fryeburg. It's a big commission.

07:42.453 --> 07:46.128
And I just lost my damn car keys.
Could you possibly make me duplicates?

07:46.293 --> 07:49.330
-That takes at least a day.
-Oh, boy, I just knew it!

07:49.693 --> 07:53.163
Easy, Trish. Maybe I can help.
I'm always good at finding things.

07:53.333 --> 07:57.372
-Did I say my name? I don't remember--
-I guessed.

07:59.733 --> 08:01.166
Now, let's find those keys.

08:01.933 --> 08:04.242
-Hey, Rachel.
-Hey, Pete.

08:04.413 --> 08:07.928
-I looked again. I couldn't find them.
Okay. I need your help.

08:08.093 --> 08:10.766
You had the coffee in your hand,
bought aspirin...

08:10.933 --> 08:13.493
...went to your car,
realized the keys were gone.

08:13.653 --> 08:15.245
-That everything?
-Yes.

08:17.173 --> 08:22.122
Look. This is gonna seem weird, but
it's just a thing I do to help me think.

08:34.893 --> 08:37.486
You bought a candy bar
before the aspirin.

08:42.693 --> 08:44.649
Mars bar.

08:50.933 --> 08:52.207
Yours, right?

08:58.693 --> 09:02.572
One more question. If I find your keys,
will you let me buy you dinner?

09:02.733 --> 09:04.246
West Wharf? 6:30?

09:04.413 --> 09:07.689
Best fried clams in the state?
It's right on your way back.

09:07.853 --> 09:10.048
Sure. Okay.

09:10.733 --> 09:13.964
-That'd be nice.
-All right.

09:15.093 --> 09:18.051
So you got here.
You opened your purse.

09:18.213 --> 09:22.092
Coffee, candy and aspirin,
you're juggling it all around.

09:22.253 --> 09:23.732
And that's when...

09:29.973 --> 09:31.804
...you dropped your keys.

09:33.453 --> 09:35.171
It's just luck, is all.

09:39.413 --> 09:41.005
Thank you.

09:49.653 --> 09:54.408
-West Wharf, right? Half past six?
-You got it.

10:04.933 --> 10:06.889
Another fuckarow.

10:47.293 --> 10:49.329
-Jones.
How are you doing?

10:49.493 --> 10:53.805
-Hey, Beaver. Same shit, different day.
-Same shit, different day.

10:54.293 --> 10:58.002
-Wanna talk?
-No, you're trying to get home.

10:58.653 --> 11:02.487
-What's up?
-Really, I got nothing. Go home.

11:02.653 --> 11:06.362
-Wait, Jonesy?
-Yeah, Beav?

11:07.413 --> 11:11.292
-You be careful.
-Be careful of what?

11:13.533 --> 11:15.251
Wish I knew.

11:41.773 --> 11:45.163
Oh, my gosh.
He's right there. Yeah.

11:45.333 --> 11:47.051
What did you say?

11:48.413 --> 11:49.812
I didn't say anything.

11:49.973 --> 11:52.043
Right. Sorry.

11:57.693 --> 11:59.365
Hey!

11:59.773 --> 12:01.843
Oh, my God!

12:02.893 --> 12:04.849
-Oh, my God!
Oh, look!

12:08.653 --> 12:11.406
Somebody call an ambulance!
It won't do any good.

12:11.573 --> 12:16.363
I looked away for one second.
Then I heard a thump. What happened?

12:16.533 --> 12:19.570
Careful, careful.
Back up, back up.

12:19.853 --> 12:23.766
Seriously....
My God! Professor Jones!

12:23.933 --> 12:27.721
I just saw him.
He can't die!

12:29.493 --> 12:31.449
Is he dead?

12:31.613 --> 12:35.731
I didn't see it. Why did he run out?

12:36.853 --> 12:38.252
Clear!

12:39.933 --> 12:42.288
No good. Flatline.
Hit it again!

12:42.453 --> 12:43.852
Clear!

12:44.013 --> 12:48.086
-What do you think?
-I think it's no good. I think he's gone.

12:49.533 --> 12:52.491
Watch out for Ister Gay.

13:24.253 --> 13:25.971
Out of my way.

13:27.453 --> 13:29.569
Jonesy, don't try to lift that stuff.

13:29.773 --> 13:34.449
Just go up to the cabin.
Here, here, look. Big jacket.

13:34.653 --> 13:37.213
-Beaver, I'm going in!
I'll see you in a second!

13:38.533 --> 13:40.364
Watch the beer.

13:50.213 --> 13:53.364
-Got blown last night.
Good for you.

13:54.053 --> 13:57.090
-First time?
-Bite my bag.

13:58.453 --> 14:02.287
Met some lady at bingo, went back
to her place, turned into a nice fuckaree.

14:02.453 --> 14:05.650
-As opposed to a fuckarow.
-Obviously.

14:05.813 --> 14:10.011
Though I've had perfectly good fuckarees
turn into fuckarows in a flash.

14:10.173 --> 14:12.403
-Try Viagra.
-Viagra?

14:12.573 --> 14:14.768
I'm practically
at full salute all day.

14:15.333 --> 14:18.609
I'm.... What do you call it?
Privatic?

14:19.173 --> 14:21.528
Prag-- Prasmatic?
Henry will know.

14:21.693 --> 14:24.685
-You're thinking of fourth grade.
-You're having wood problems?

14:24.853 --> 14:26.923
-You haven't tried it, have you?
-Hell, no!

14:27.093 --> 14:32.087
Drop that little blue bomb, you're hard
as a Louisville Slugger for 12 hours.

14:32.893 --> 14:33.928
Twelve hours?

14:34.093 --> 14:37.483
I'm talking Yastrzemski.
You don't have to need it to love it.

14:37.853 --> 14:41.368
Bingo? Did you say bingo,
like the game in church basements?

14:42.133 --> 14:44.522
-There's trim there.
-Beaver!

14:45.373 --> 14:47.568
I thought my deal was pathetic.

14:52.133 --> 14:54.931
-Ah!
-You just watch. That's your job.

14:55.133 --> 14:56.885
I'm fine.
Uh-huh.

14:59.093 --> 15:02.290
H, you been thinking
about Duddits more than usual?

15:02.453 --> 15:04.011
Uh-huh.

15:04.773 --> 15:07.082
Remember we were gonna
go see him that weekend?

15:07.253 --> 15:09.972
-I remember.
-Then I got hit.

15:15.413 --> 15:17.483
I gotta tell you something weird.

15:17.653 --> 15:22.773
The night I got hit, I was standing there
and across the street, I saw Duddits.

15:23.573 --> 15:26.610
Just like he was that day
we first saw him back in Derry.

15:26.773 --> 15:30.004
He was calling out for help
and everyone was ignoring him.

15:30.173 --> 15:33.370
Then he looked over at me.
He looked directly at me.

15:34.213 --> 15:36.966
And he motioned for me
to come to him.

15:44.493 --> 15:46.802
You believe I saw him, don't you?

15:47.733 --> 15:49.689
Yes, sir, I do.

15:51.413 --> 15:55.247
Duddits loves me, I know that.
He loves us all.

15:58.613 --> 16:01.173
He would die before
he'd ever hurt us.

16:02.573 --> 16:05.133
So why was he calling me
into the street to get hit?

16:07.453 --> 16:10.206
Maybe there's more to the story
we don't get yet.

16:14.773 --> 16:16.365
-You don't know shit.
Name it!

16:16.533 --> 16:19.730
I'll name it after we come up
with a small wager.

16:19.893 --> 16:21.326
-50 bucks.
-What's the subject?

16:21.493 --> 16:24.246
In the movies, when people
wake up together...

16:24.413 --> 16:27.086
...they immediately start kissing
and going at it.

16:27.253 --> 16:31.212
But they never get up first, take a leak
and brush their goddamn teeth.

16:31.373 --> 16:34.285
Which is pretty much necessary
when you wake up.

16:34.773 --> 16:37.333
What's it called when
you got a constant woody?

16:37.493 --> 16:40.530
-You mean priapism.
-See? I'm practically priasmic.

16:40.693 --> 16:42.092
Priapismic.

16:42.253 --> 16:45.051
-Whatever! It's hard.
-That's what you're betting on?

16:45.213 --> 16:50.287
I can name the one movie where they
acknowledge the scuzzy facts of life.

16:50.453 --> 16:54.207
-I'll give you a quarter.
-A quarter from you. 50 bucks from you.

16:56.173 --> 16:59.609
-Promised Land.
-Promised Land? Never heard of it.

16:59.893 --> 17:02.612
Meg Ryan and what's his name?
Reefer Sutherland.

17:02.933 --> 17:05.685
-Kiefer.
-From, I don't know, 1988 or something?

17:05.853 --> 17:09.163
So Meg Ryan wakes up in the morning
and says, "Where's the cat?"

17:09.333 --> 17:12.848
And he says, "What cat?" And she says,
"The cat that shit in my mouth."

17:14.693 --> 17:16.012
That will be 50 small.

17:16.173 --> 17:18.767
-Bullshit! You made it up.
-Could Beaver make that up?

17:18.933 --> 17:22.561
You can have that priceless piece
of cinematic trivia absolutely free.

17:22.733 --> 17:26.281
I'm filing that in the "Who-gives-a-shit"
section of my memory warehouse.

17:27.613 --> 17:31.242
-What's the memory warehouse?
-You don't remember?

17:31.413 --> 17:34.052
-I must've forgot.
-You forgot the memory warehouse?

17:34.213 --> 17:37.808
-Just remind me. Don't give me shit.
-It's in his head. We've all got one.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.123
-Hasn't that place been condemned?
Not yet.

17:40.293 --> 17:44.206
It's so crowded I throw something out
every time I learn something new.

17:44.373 --> 17:48.685
When I got my new laptop I had to
throw out my files of rock 'n' roll lyrics.

17:52.893 --> 17:56.522
My warehouse was washed away
in a flood about 10 years ago.

17:56.693 --> 17:58.570
I didn't know they had enough beer.

17:58.773 --> 18:00.843
Hey. Hey, hey.

18:01.013 --> 18:04.562
Jonesy, if that really
is your name...

18:06.613 --> 18:09.810
-...what do you do with the old files?
-I burn them.

18:47.533 --> 18:50.923
-You threw out the "Blue Bayou" lyrics?
-No.

18:51.213 --> 18:53.329
No, if I really can't
let go of something...

18:53.493 --> 18:56.371
...I sneak it back to an office
where I keep my secret stuff.

19:14.333 --> 19:16.210
Where do you keep
the stuff on Duddits?

19:16.373 --> 19:20.491
He's got a special section all his
own on the third level.

19:20.693 --> 19:23.890
I can't stop thinking about the Duds
lately. How about you guys?

19:24.533 --> 19:28.082
It's this place. He's all around here,
even though he's never been here.

19:30.693 --> 19:34.083
This is our 20th year coming out
here to Hole in the Wall.

19:34.253 --> 19:36.687
And fuck me, Freddy,
here's to 20 more.

19:36.853 --> 19:38.411
Yeah.

19:38.693 --> 19:39.921
Twenty more.

19:42.773 --> 19:44.525
Here's to Duddits...

19:44.773 --> 19:46.570
...our dreamcatcher.

19:46.733 --> 19:48.485
Wish he was here.

19:48.853 --> 19:50.047
To the Duds.

19:50.213 --> 19:53.011
-To Douglas Cavell.
-To Duddits.

20:00.773 --> 20:03.970
Why is Tina Schlossinger's
pussy on the wall of Tracker Brothers?

20:04.133 --> 20:06.442
Because I said so. It's a picture.

20:06.613 --> 20:08.331
-Have you seen it?
No...

20:08.493 --> 20:11.087
...but the kid who sits
behind me in shop, he saw it.

20:11.253 --> 20:13.130
Tracker Brothers is deserted.

20:13.293 --> 20:15.966
You don't want to see
the homecoming queen's pussy?

20:16.133 --> 20:17.248
Don't come.

20:18.493 --> 20:21.405
Fuck me, Freddy! Some kid's shirt.

20:21.573 --> 20:24.531
-So?
-It's new!

20:28.853 --> 20:30.684
Scooby-Doo.

20:31.413 --> 20:33.722
"I belong to Douglas Cavell."

20:33.893 --> 20:38.967
"If the boy I belong to is lost, please
bring him to 19 Maple Lane, Derry."

20:39.133 --> 20:42.284
Must belong to one of those kids
from the Retard Academy.

20:44.893 --> 20:48.408
Come on. Eat it. Eat it.
Eat it and you can go.

20:48.573 --> 20:50.165
Hey, you guys!
Quit it!

20:50.773 --> 20:52.445
Just fucking quit it!

20:53.973 --> 20:55.247
What are you doing?

20:55.413 --> 20:58.530
You're trying to make him eat that?
What's wrong with you?

20:58.693 --> 21:01.605
Got it. I'll make him eat
this dog turd, then he can go.

21:01.773 --> 21:04.207
You go now.
Unless you want half.

21:04.373 --> 21:06.807
Take a hike, girls,
while you have the chance.

21:06.973 --> 21:09.328
Piss off.
That's your final warning.

21:11.413 --> 21:13.973
-You better watch it!
-Why is that?

21:14.533 --> 21:17.127
-I know who you are.
-I'm trembling with fear.

21:17.293 --> 21:20.046
-You're Rich Grenadeau, the quarterback!
-So?

21:20.213 --> 21:23.569
What will people say when we tell them
what we caught you doing?

21:24.173 --> 21:27.324
You won't tell anybody anything
because you'll be dead.

21:28.893 --> 21:31.885
-Get ready, Pete.
-Give the word, Henry.

21:32.053 --> 21:35.728
Pete can fly. When you come for us,
all we have to do is get in your way.

21:36.373 --> 21:37.965
I can't catch that little dick?

21:38.133 --> 21:41.409
You know who that is?
That's Pete Moore.

21:42.573 --> 21:45.804
That's right, fat-ass. Pete Moore.
No one can catch him.

21:45.973 --> 21:48.885
He's going straight to his house
to tell his mother.

21:49.053 --> 21:51.248
She'll call the cops
and then we'll see.

21:52.013 --> 21:54.129
-You know him, is that it?
-Never saw him.

21:54.293 --> 21:58.730
Then why ask for trouble?
I mean, look at this moron!

21:58.893 --> 22:01.930
-He likes this attention.
-How do you know what he likes?

22:05.333 --> 22:06.652
Come on, you dickweeds!

22:08.053 --> 22:11.170
-You want to fight us?
-Yes! Yes!

22:11.333 --> 22:13.130
I'm gone, Henry.
Just say the word.

22:13.293 --> 22:16.968
-Why? You'll lose! Why?
-Because you can't do that! It's wrong!

22:17.133 --> 22:19.408
And I'm gonna tell the world!
Tell everybody!

22:22.253 --> 22:25.609
-You want us to leave, is that it?
-No! Let's kick their asses!

22:32.693 --> 22:36.208
Let's go.
We'll get him later. You know that.

22:36.373 --> 22:38.170
Get you all later.

22:48.533 --> 22:51.093
It's okay. You can stop now.

22:51.853 --> 22:53.127
Do something. Somebody!

22:54.773 --> 22:56.365
If I do...

22:57.813 --> 23:02.933
...and you tell anybody,
I'll never hang with you guys again.

23:24.573 --> 23:26.325
I never knew Beav could sing.

23:31.413 --> 23:35.531
-Beaver, that's beautiful.
-I mean it. Not one word.

23:35.693 --> 23:37.365
Beaver!

23:37.613 --> 23:39.569
You've got a fan.

23:40.213 --> 23:41.202
This yours?

23:55.333 --> 23:58.325
Douglas Cavell.
That's your name, right?

24:00.133 --> 24:01.486
I Duddits.

24:01.653 --> 24:04.565
What?
-I Duddits!

24:04.733 --> 24:07.088
Duddits?
-Duddits.

24:07.453 --> 24:09.364
Duddits, we got to get you home.

24:20.493 --> 24:23.530
Hey, guys! Come here!
Leave the kid there.

24:24.173 --> 24:27.449
Stand right here, Duddits.
Right here with Scooby, okay?

24:46.493 --> 24:48.848
Jesus Christ bananas!

24:49.013 --> 24:51.573
No way is that
Tina Jean Schlossinger.

24:51.733 --> 24:54.531
Maybe her grandmother.
Good going, Beav.

24:54.693 --> 24:57.765
Holy God. We came all the way
here just for that?

24:58.453 --> 25:02.241
No. We came for him.

25:27.413 --> 25:29.768
Hey, Pete. You forgot the dogs.

25:31.133 --> 25:34.603
Uh-oh. Weather moving in.
Double storm.

25:34.773 --> 25:38.288
Alberta Clipper first, maybe 8 inches...

25:38.613 --> 25:40.604
...with a nor'easter on its tail.

25:41.733 --> 25:45.965
-Get on back to the cabin, Henry.
-Heading straight there, Mr. G.

25:46.213 --> 25:47.931
-Don't mess around.
No, sir.

27:32.373 --> 27:33.772
Easy, fella.

27:33.933 --> 27:37.164
Easy. You're okay.
You're all right.

27:37.653 --> 27:39.848
Thank God. Thank God.

27:40.013 --> 27:43.449
Gee, thank God!

27:43.613 --> 27:46.969
I'm lost. I've been lost
in the woods since yesterday.

27:47.133 --> 27:50.569
Let's get you inside.
Get you warm.

27:51.453 --> 27:54.684
-How would that be?
-Sure.

28:08.333 --> 28:10.164
Here, let me get that.

28:14.293 --> 28:19.321
-Rick McCarthy.
-Gary Jones. It's Jonesy to everybody.

28:19.493 --> 28:23.964
Our damn cell phones are on the blink
now, so I can't call for help...

28:24.133 --> 28:25.851
...but our car will be back soon.

28:26.013 --> 28:30.404
I didn't think I'd make it.
I lost the folks I was with.

28:31.293 --> 28:34.046
You saved me, that's for sure.

28:35.693 --> 28:36.887
What's that?

28:38.293 --> 28:40.090
It's a dreamcatcher.

28:42.293 --> 28:45.365
Indian charm.
Catches nightmares...

28:45.933 --> 28:48.731
...keeps them away.
Keeps you safe down here.

28:48.893 --> 28:50.804
I've had enough nightmares.

28:55.653 --> 28:57.325
Been doing that all night.

28:58.413 --> 29:00.324
I ate some berries in the dark.

29:02.573 --> 29:05.133
I think they must have upset me.

29:28.133 --> 29:29.646
I know what you're thinking.

29:29.813 --> 29:33.965
Anyone who drinks at 11 a.m. needs
to take the cure, but I only do it here.

29:34.453 --> 29:37.013
In the real world, I never
drink till after 5:00...

29:37.173 --> 29:39.846
...and if it ever does,
I'm on the wagon for life.

29:40.453 --> 29:41.522
Glad to hear it.

29:44.973 --> 29:46.406
What's the matter with you?

29:48.013 --> 29:51.369
About six months ago,
the day Jonesy got hit...

29:51.533 --> 29:57.005
...I did something terrible with a patient.
I humiliated him. Drove him out.

29:57.173 --> 29:59.084
Barry Neiman.

29:59.573 --> 30:03.532
Couple days ago, I saw his picture
in the paper. He ate himself to death.

30:04.573 --> 30:08.407
Mind if I don't use that story
next time I'm trying to sell a Mustang?

30:08.933 --> 30:13.484
You were a lead balloon long before
this porker munched his way to eternity.

30:13.653 --> 30:18.010
Thanks. You're a real comfort.
You got a real delicate touch to you.

30:20.853 --> 30:24.687
Here you go, Rick, buddy.
That will fix you up.

30:30.853 --> 30:34.971
Jesus Christ bananas!
Some fuckarow this is turning into!

30:37.533 --> 30:40.206
-Thanks a lot, Beav.
Yeah, I think I got it all.

30:40.373 --> 30:42.125
What happened to you?

30:45.013 --> 30:49.211
Hi. Joe Clarendon.
Call me Beaver.

30:49.373 --> 30:51.409
Rick here had a bad night
in the woods.

30:51.573 --> 30:53.052
Welcome.

30:53.213 --> 30:56.489
-Is that frostbite?
-No, I get the same thing from peanuts.

30:56.653 --> 30:57.688
It's allergy.

31:00.373 --> 31:02.045
Grilled cheese, anyone?

31:02.213 --> 31:06.650
No, the soup's fine for me.
I'll bite. Sail it over here.

31:08.093 --> 31:12.245
My mother used to feed me
pea soup when I was feeling--

31:15.533 --> 31:17.330
Bitch in a buzz saw!

31:17.493 --> 31:21.008
I've heard some mighty burps
in my time, but that's the blue ribbon.

31:21.173 --> 31:22.367
I am so embarrassed.

31:22.533 --> 31:25.331
-Rick ate some berries in the woods.
Oh, no.

31:29.533 --> 31:30.727
Oh, my God!

31:32.053 --> 31:33.452
Oh, my God, that's awful!

31:34.013 --> 31:35.082
I'm so sorry!

31:35.253 --> 31:39.007
Rick, buddy, don't worry about it.
There's more room out than in, anyway.

31:39.173 --> 31:41.926
What have you been eating,
woodchuck turds?

31:44.693 --> 31:45.967
Know what I think?

31:46.653 --> 31:50.009
I think you need to lie down
and take you a little nap.

31:50.893 --> 31:52.804
You know, I bet you're right.

31:53.333 --> 31:54.812
I'm just tired, that's all.

31:55.413 --> 31:58.007
-Come on.
-My hat.

31:59.373 --> 32:00.647
Beaver?

32:02.093 --> 32:05.165
Come on. In here.

32:09.333 --> 32:12.052
Thank you for taking me in.
Thank you both.

32:12.213 --> 32:15.922
-Shit, anybody would have.
-Maybe. Maybe not.

32:16.573 --> 32:18.723
All right, this is in case
you have to urk...

32:18.893 --> 32:22.408
...if you can't get to the bathroom,
which is the third door to your left.

32:22.573 --> 32:25.485
If you go in the first,
you'll take a shit in the closet.

32:25.973 --> 32:27.929
If you need anything, we're outside.

32:42.373 --> 32:43.886
Fuck me, give me some air!

32:44.053 --> 32:47.090
We got any gas masks handy?
We need a biohazard team in here.

32:48.413 --> 32:52.326
-Wanna hear what'll freak you out more?
-Not really.

32:52.773 --> 32:54.252
You know his huge stomach?

32:54.413 --> 32:58.565
When he got here, his stomach was
normal, but his chest was out to here!

32:58.733 --> 33:00.132
I wish Henry was here.

33:00.293 --> 33:01.931
He's a shrink, not an internist.

33:02.133 --> 33:05.125
He went to med school.
Did you?

33:06.613 --> 33:08.365
I thought about it.

33:22.133 --> 33:23.851
You better get a run at it.

33:33.453 --> 33:35.091
Shit!
Watch it!

33:35.253 --> 33:36.402
What the hell?

34:02.853 --> 34:08.052
Pete, are you okay?
I broke my leg! My damn leg!

34:08.213 --> 34:11.091
-Okay. Hang on. Hang on a second.
-Help me!

34:11.253 --> 34:13.369
-I'm caught! I can't--
God!

34:20.453 --> 34:25.368
-God.
-Henry! A little help here!

34:25.853 --> 34:27.844
Hang on, Pete. Hang on.

34:28.013 --> 34:31.688
-Okay. Here comes the seat belt.
-I just opened that beer.

34:33.773 --> 34:35.331
I got you.

34:46.973 --> 34:48.610
How's your leg?

34:49.652 --> 34:54.123
Well, it ain't broken.
It's just locked up, is all.

35:13.253 --> 35:15.721
You don't suppose
he got exposed to radiation?

35:15.893 --> 35:20.011
I saw that once in a movie. Guy ended
up bald as Telly what's-his-fuck.

35:20.173 --> 35:24.451
This guy's got plenty of hair. But that
red mark got bigger while I watched it.

35:28.253 --> 35:31.643
-What are you doing?
-Peanut butter calms me down.

35:32.293 --> 35:36.081
-Somebody else might want to use that.
-I'll leave some.

35:38.053 --> 35:39.486
Beav.

35:40.853 --> 35:42.286
Beaver.

35:46.973 --> 35:49.089
Criminettlies!

36:05.173 --> 36:06.970
I think it's a woman.

36:08.373 --> 36:11.126
I ought to warn you.
I'm gonna strangle this broad.

36:11.293 --> 36:14.091
-I'd guess she's already dead.
-I'll strangle her anyway.

36:14.253 --> 36:16.209
She almost got us both killed.

36:17.493 --> 36:20.849
Hello! Here we come, ma'am.
Don't be startled.

36:29.973 --> 36:31.486
Hello?

36:32.333 --> 36:35.962
Forget it, H. She's gone.

36:38.853 --> 36:40.047
Hello!

36:42.133 --> 36:48.288
Ma'am, can you hear me?
Are you okay? Can you hear me?

36:51.093 --> 36:54.608
I wonder if maybe that's how
they say hello around here.

36:54.773 --> 36:58.448
Listen, Miss Road Kill,
you almost got us dead.

36:59.533 --> 37:01.364
Say something.

37:02.333 --> 37:05.211
I have to find Rick.

37:08.013 --> 37:10.607
-Okay.
-Rick.

37:15.053 --> 37:16.611
Yeah.

37:17.973 --> 37:20.282
Fuck me, Freddy.

37:26.453 --> 37:30.207
-What's all that red stuff on their fur?
-Just like McCarthy's cheek.

37:30.773 --> 37:34.652
-I never saw anything like this before.
-Even the bears look scared.

37:34.813 --> 37:38.169
-Of what? Where are they going?
-It's not where that worries me...

37:38.333 --> 37:40.722
...it's what are they running away from?

37:48.853 --> 37:50.127
What the hell?

37:52.573 --> 37:55.531
This could be perfect.
They can get Stinky to a hospital.

37:55.693 --> 37:56.842
Hey, you guys!

38:00.933 --> 38:03.606
We need help! Got a sick guy inside!

38:03.853 --> 38:06.162
This area is under temporary quarantine.

38:06.333 --> 38:08.642
-Stay where you are.
-What quarantine?

38:08.813 --> 38:13.011
-We got a sick guy down here!
-We need your help here!

38:13.173 --> 38:15.971
We got a real sick guy!
-Take him with you now!

38:16.533 --> 38:21.448
Glad you're okay. This situation
will be resolved in 24 to 48 hours.

38:23.853 --> 38:25.491
Kiss my bender!

38:49.493 --> 38:52.883
I gotta ask you, old buddy.
Because I'm confused.

38:53.053 --> 38:57.205
-Is this SSDD or not?
Definitely not.

38:57.373 --> 38:58.965
Different shit today, Pete.

38:59.133 --> 39:02.603
And a pretty weird day so far,
if you want to know.

39:02.773 --> 39:04.491
Over here.

39:07.693 --> 39:10.366
Okay. There you go.

39:11.413 --> 39:12.641
Easy.

39:17.733 --> 39:19.371
Nine miles to Hole in the Wall.

39:21.013 --> 39:22.765
I think I can manage it.

39:23.733 --> 39:26.122
I'll bring the snowmobile back
and get you both.

39:26.293 --> 39:30.127
Now, Pete, you listen to me.
Don't go back to the car for beer.

39:30.293 --> 39:35.492
-Stay with her. Keep her warm.
-Right hand to God, Dr. D.

39:36.213 --> 39:37.407
Henry!

39:37.573 --> 39:39.723
If we die before you get back...

39:40.453 --> 39:43.604
...promise you'll tell everybody
she wasn't my date.

39:52.213 --> 39:54.010
-I don't like this.
-Me neither.

39:54.173 --> 39:55.162
Not at all.

39:55.333 --> 39:59.451
This is turning into a double fuckarow.
A real jobba-nobba.

41:04.533 --> 41:07.525
-Rick, you okay?
I'm a little sick, fellas.

41:07.693 --> 41:11.652
-I just need to make a little room.
-McCarthy, Rick, open up, man.

41:11.813 --> 41:14.452
Go away!
-Open the door or we break it down.

41:14.613 --> 41:18.128
Can't a man have privacy?
-Rick, where are you bleeding from?

41:18.293 --> 41:21.603
Bleeding? I'm not bleeding.

41:24.693 --> 41:27.969
-Let's do it.
-I'm not positive I wanna go in there.

41:28.133 --> 41:32.046
What if he's dying? Scooby-Dooby-Doo,
we got some work to do now.

41:32.413 --> 41:34.881
On three. Ready?

41:35.173 --> 41:38.449
One.... Two....

41:39.093 --> 41:41.812
Hold it!
What if we just bounce off?

41:43.413 --> 41:47.201
-No bounce, no play.
-Right. No bounce, no play.

41:47.893 --> 41:49.485
One....

41:49.933 --> 41:53.164
And a two.... Three!

42:00.493 --> 42:03.405
Oh, fuck! Oh, man!
Fuck!

42:03.693 --> 42:06.048
I don't want to see this!
I can't see this.

42:06.213 --> 42:09.649
-Shut up a minute. Mr. McCarthy? Rick?
-Is he still alive?

42:09.813 --> 42:11.485
I don't know. Rick?
Rick, are you--?

42:13.413 --> 42:16.962
Oh, man! Jonesy, if he can still do that,
he must be alive.

42:17.133 --> 42:19.124
Can you hear me?
I think he's dead.

42:19.293 --> 42:21.488
Bullshit! He dropped a clinker!
I heard it.

42:21.653 --> 42:25.089
-I don't think that was a clinker.
-That's enough, snap out of it!

42:25.893 --> 42:28.168
-Oh, my God!
-My God!

42:32.053 --> 42:33.281
-No!
-No?

42:33.453 --> 42:34.442
No.

42:36.533 --> 42:40.845
Good move! It's trapped.
Got nowhere to go but the septic tank.

42:59.573 --> 43:00.642
Okay.

43:05.093 --> 43:06.765
Oh, shit!

43:07.333 --> 43:10.609
-Listen, we're gonna change places.
-What?

43:10.773 --> 43:13.048
-One of us is gonna go to the shed.
-No way!

43:13.213 --> 43:15.807
Shut up and listen!
There's friction tape there.

43:15.973 --> 43:18.567
You go get it, come back.
We'll tape the lid down.

43:18.773 --> 43:20.843
Then we're gonna get the hell
out of here!

43:21.653 --> 43:24.326
-You get the tape, Jonesy.
-Don't be brave, Beav.

43:24.493 --> 43:26.768
You're faster than me.
I'll sit on Thumper.

43:26.933 --> 43:29.925
No, if it does get out, you can't fight it.
Not with your hip.

43:30.413 --> 43:33.166
Oh, my God!
Goddamn it! Go!

43:44.013 --> 43:45.765
-And Beav?
-Yeah?

43:45.973 --> 43:47.884
Sit tight, buddy.

43:51.293 --> 43:53.853
Okay. Okay.

44:44.413 --> 44:46.802
All right. Okay.

44:53.973 --> 44:58.649
Shit! Earth to Jonesy!
Come in, Jonesy!

45:10.213 --> 45:13.649
Jonesy. Jonesy.

45:14.693 --> 45:19.084
Okay. Calm down now. Okay.

45:20.533 --> 45:21.761
Okay.

45:22.333 --> 45:25.848
Okay, here it is. Okay.

45:30.893 --> 45:33.009
Find the damn tape!

46:42.813 --> 46:44.804
Where is it?

46:48.133 --> 46:49.805
Coming, Beav!

47:05.813 --> 47:07.929
Beaver! Beav!

47:08.253 --> 47:10.608
I got the-- What the--?

47:17.173 --> 47:18.526
Jonesy, get out of here!

47:19.453 --> 47:20.522
Beaver.

47:20.733 --> 47:23.531
-Get out! Shut the door!
-No.

47:25.173 --> 47:26.447
Run, Jonesy.

48:23.253 --> 48:25.164
You killed him.

48:25.333 --> 48:27.722
You killed Beaver.

48:27.893 --> 48:30.282
You killed him, you fuck!

48:32.533 --> 48:33.602
Ah!

49:57.333 --> 49:59.767
What do you want?

51:21.453 --> 51:25.002
They call the red stuff Ripley,
after the broad in the Alien movies.

51:25.173 --> 51:27.607
We eradicate the animals
as they flee the Blue Zone.

51:27.773 --> 51:28.808
The populace?

51:28.973 --> 51:33.012
We bring civilians to Gosselin's.
We'll detain them till we figure this out.

51:33.173 --> 51:38.406
And, Owen? This time the ETs belong
to you. That's right, bucko.

51:38.573 --> 51:40.564
-You'll be Blue Boy leader.
-Finally.

51:40.733 --> 51:43.167
-How many left?
-About a hundred.

51:43.333 --> 51:46.564
Yeah. Not nearly enough
for a serious incursion.

51:46.733 --> 51:48.883
My guess is,
it's a crash-landing.

51:49.053 --> 51:52.523
They've never picked terrain
like this before or cold weather.

51:52.693 --> 51:53.967
What's your call?

51:54.133 --> 51:57.091
The biggest threat
is them getting out of our net.

51:57.253 --> 51:59.005
Crash-landing or not...

51:59.173 --> 52:01.767
...they'll try to get out
and spread the infection.

52:03.093 --> 52:07.371
I always say they never visited a world
they wouldn't rather own.

52:08.093 --> 52:10.448
They're up to their old tricks.

52:10.653 --> 52:13.213
Using a standard grayboy look...

52:13.373 --> 52:17.412
...with the innocent doggy eyes
and smooth baby-butt skin.

52:17.573 --> 52:20.326
They project what they think
we want to see.

52:20.493 --> 52:24.930
But I've had a look at the real thing. You
wouldn't want it marrying your sister.

52:25.493 --> 52:30.851
-Difference of opinion about the Ripley.
-Really? Who has an opinion?

52:31.013 --> 52:33.163
-Who do you think?
-General Matheson.

52:33.333 --> 52:36.689
-Three-star General Matheson.
-Three?

52:37.173 --> 52:39.687
-When did you see him?
-They called me in yesterday.

52:39.853 --> 52:43.528
What's the opinion
of those enlightened cocksuckers...

52:43.693 --> 52:45.490
...who've never been near an ET?

52:45.653 --> 52:49.532
They say the fungus doesn't take hold
in all victims. Some of them get over it.

52:50.093 --> 52:52.561
Really?
And what about the shit weasels?

52:52.733 --> 52:54.963
The ones blasting out
the basement door?

52:55.133 --> 52:58.011
Does Matheson think
folks get over one of those puppies?

52:58.173 --> 53:03.805
Their theory is, they only grow in a small
percentage of the exposed population.

53:04.693 --> 53:07.161
Do you like that theory, bucko?

53:10.533 --> 53:12.046
I think it's crap.

53:12.693 --> 53:15.605
So if you thought someone
had been exposed...

53:15.773 --> 53:19.402
-...and you had them in your grasp--
-I wouldn't want them walking out...

53:19.573 --> 53:25.489
-...to wander as they wish.
-Bucko, I think we're on the same page.

53:25.853 --> 53:28.367
Pissing in the same latrine.

53:28.773 --> 53:33.130
If the Ripley gets out of this
pine-tree paradise....

53:33.293 --> 53:36.524
Well, it just can't be allowed to do that.

53:37.613 --> 53:40.491
I've quarantined the entire area.

53:40.893 --> 53:43.487
-Nothing leaves alive.
-Roger that, boss.

53:44.813 --> 53:45.802
Come!

53:47.453 --> 53:49.489
Got Maples here, boss.

53:50.133 --> 53:53.808
-Corporal Maples, sir. I mean, boss.
I know who you are, Maples.

53:53.973 --> 53:58.649
I handpicked every man in Blue Boy.
Sometimes I wonder about my judgment.

53:58.813 --> 54:02.362
Yes, sir. I'm sorry, boss.
Do you know the catechism?

54:02.533 --> 54:05.843
-Yes, the B.U.C. for all buckos.
-Is Blue Unit part of regular Army?

54:06.013 --> 54:08.322
-No, boss. Better.
How does Blue Unit operate?

54:08.493 --> 54:12.850
Under the radar. We don't salute, display
rank, say "sir." A force unto ourselves.

54:13.013 --> 54:15.083
-Regular Army compared to Blue Unit?
-Pussies.

54:15.253 --> 54:18.165
What rules does it operate by?
Rules of combat.

54:18.333 --> 54:19.766
That's right, laddie.

54:20.133 --> 54:23.808
When a soldier disobeys a superior's
orders, he puts everyone at risk.

54:23.973 --> 54:27.409
And is to be punished immediately
by appropriate command personnel.

54:27.573 --> 54:29.962
That's me. Capisce?
Good.

54:30.213 --> 54:33.205
Now answer me one question
and you can boogie out of here.

54:33.373 --> 54:35.887
But you have to answer honestly.

54:37.573 --> 54:42.966
You were on containment detail at 0600
this morning, sector 14 of Blue Zone.

54:43.133 --> 54:46.125
Did you allow a young woman
and her 4-year-old daughter...

54:46.293 --> 54:50.206
...to exit the zone in their own vehicle
on Hickam Valley Road?

54:50.573 --> 54:53.326
Colonel Curtis, she hadn't been
in the zone.

54:53.493 --> 54:56.405
She made a wrong turn.
She couldn't have been contaminated.

54:56.573 --> 54:59.565
You know this for a fact?
Or because she told you so?

54:59.933 --> 55:02.367
-For a fact, boss.
-Scout's honor?

55:05.370 --> 55:10.364
Can you raise your hand and tell me
honestly that you know this for a fact?

55:14.970 --> 55:16.688
Then do it, Maples.

55:17.090 --> 55:19.968
Swear on it.
Scout's honor.

55:25.930 --> 55:27.283
Scout's honor.

55:30.090 --> 55:32.524
Stop your blatting, laddie-buck!

55:33.450 --> 55:35.486
You just avoided a court-martial, boy.

55:35.650 --> 55:38.369
You lie to me again,
you'll be facing a firing squad.

55:38.530 --> 55:41.966
-Get him out before I change my mind.
Let's get him out of here.

55:42.330 --> 55:43.809
Sentry!

55:54.090 --> 55:56.558
-Jesus, Abe.
-I warned him.

55:56.730 --> 55:59.369
Could have gotten off
with a slap on the wrist.

55:59.890 --> 56:03.166
-Instead of taking his whole hand?
-He crossed the Curtis line!

56:03.530 --> 56:06.090
He came into my house, told me lies.

56:06.490 --> 56:08.765
-You think I'm crazy, Owen?
-A little.

56:12.930 --> 56:16.605
I lost my temper there. But that
little worm did something worse.

56:16.970 --> 56:19.279
The pretty mom he let pass
this morning?

56:19.450 --> 56:22.681
She's down at the barn right now
crawling with the Ripley.

56:22.850 --> 56:24.442
Twenty-five years, Owen.

56:24.610 --> 56:28.569
Twenty-five years I've been going out
to fight these alien bastards...

56:28.730 --> 56:33.087
...show them they picked the wrong
place, knocked on the wrong door.

56:33.250 --> 56:36.287
And frankly, laddie,
the tank is running a little low.

56:36.450 --> 56:40.762
Luckily for me, there's one bit
of good news in this blizzard of bullshit.

56:41.090 --> 56:46.005
I have you. To lead the assault today
and to take over for me tomorrow.

56:46.850 --> 56:50.160
-What are you talking about, Abe?
-It's my last dance, Owen.

56:50.330 --> 56:54.528
From now on, you will lead the band.

56:55.770 --> 56:58.000
-You know where I got that?
-John Wayne.

56:58.210 --> 57:02.169
That's right. He gave it to me.
And now I'm giving it to you.

57:02.370 --> 57:07.398
-Abe, I don't know how to....
-Let's not get all girlie with each other.

57:07.570 --> 57:10.687
-Just tell me how we do it.
-We go in fast and hard.

57:10.850 --> 57:12.329
-How do we come out?
-Clean...

57:12.490 --> 57:14.401
...and smiling.

57:24.610 --> 57:26.202
Ah.

57:31.690 --> 57:33.760
Honey, I'm home.

57:43.090 --> 57:46.207
That's a good idea.
Catch a little shuteye.

57:46.370 --> 57:49.840
Save your energy
for those horrendous farts!

58:56.050 --> 59:02.159
Well, it's very nice of you to
say so. I find you very attractive also.

59:03.490 --> 59:07.722
You're one of those rare women who
can handle the full-size Ford Expedition.

59:07.890 --> 59:13.362
The truck that handles like a luxury car.
A really big luxury car.

59:18.650 --> 59:22.802
But seriously, folks,
there is one issue I'd like to bring up...

59:22.970 --> 59:26.724
...just in case I should, you know,
kick the bucket out here...

59:26.890 --> 59:32.726
...turn into a goddamn Petesicle.
Not that I think that's inevitable.

59:32.890 --> 59:37.122
I'm sure Henry or Jonesy or Beaver
will be coming to get us soon.

59:38.050 --> 59:41.008
They're my friends.
We're all best friends.

59:43.090 --> 59:46.685
Now, ma'am,
I'll be very candid with you about this...

59:46.850 --> 59:51.446
...so please, don't get freaked out
or think that I'm some kind of weirdo...

59:51.610 --> 59:54.522
...who you shouldn't meet
for the best fried clams in Maine.

59:54.690 --> 59:58.126
Just some innocent fried clams
at the West Wharf!

59:59.810 --> 01:00:01.880
You see, the four of us,
best friends...

01:00:02.050 --> 01:00:05.201
...we all have this other friend
by the name of Duddits.

01:00:05.370 --> 01:00:09.727
And our friend Duddits, well,
he's not your average old buddy.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:16.322
One day, a long time ago,
he gave us all this kind of gift.

01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:19.846
It's this.... How shall I put it?

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:25.683
This ability.
This ability to know things...

01:00:25.850 --> 01:00:29.923
...to talk to each other without talking
at all, just mind-to-mind.

01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:32.650
Do you see what I'm getting at?

01:00:39.290 --> 01:00:41.087
I knew you would.

01:00:42.330 --> 01:00:45.003
Lately, I've been having this dream...

01:00:45.170 --> 01:00:50.881
...and in the dream, I understand how
Duddits could give us a gift like that.

01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:54.848
I think maybe our friend Duds
is not from this planet.

01:00:55.010 --> 01:00:57.319
I think Duddits is from somewhere else...

01:00:57.490 --> 01:01:02.723
...and he came here
to prepare us for something.

01:01:06.890 --> 01:01:08.448
It's crazy.

01:01:09.490 --> 01:01:12.880
Talking shit about
the only perfect person I ever knew.

01:01:13.850 --> 01:01:18.685
He's so goddamned good.
I can't believe he's a human.

01:01:20.290 --> 01:01:24.124
I should be singing his praises,
not questioning what galaxy he's--

01:01:24.290 --> 01:01:25.769
I gotta pee.

01:01:29.530 --> 01:01:30.645
That's what I should do.

01:01:41.930 --> 01:01:43.488
Here's to you, Duds.

01:01:45.050 --> 01:01:47.166
The highest civilian decoration.

01:01:58.130 --> 01:01:59.961
Lord, I will never drink again.

01:02:59.970 --> 01:03:01.403
Let me get this straight.

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:06.405
Yesterday you want to call it quits,
throw in the towel, pull the plug.

01:03:06.570 --> 01:03:11.963
Today, you're begging, praying.
Couple more hours. Couple more miles.

01:03:12.130 --> 01:03:14.200
Make up your mind.

01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:18.569
Jonesy!
Way to go, motherfucker!

01:03:18.730 --> 01:03:20.448
Here you come to save the day!

01:03:24.730 --> 01:03:26.049
What the hell?

01:03:27.650 --> 01:03:29.606
Who's Mr. Gray?

01:03:30.770 --> 01:03:33.079
What are you trying to tell me, Jonesy?

01:03:35.130 --> 01:03:36.961
You're not Jonesy.

01:04:12.930 --> 01:04:15.967
What was that,
Mr. Jones? What did we just pass?

01:04:16.530 --> 01:04:21.001
Are you speaking to me?
-Yes, I am, Mr. Jones. Or is it Jonesy?

01:04:21.170 --> 01:04:24.924
That's what your friends call you,
isn't it? Let's be friends.

01:04:25.410 --> 01:04:28.288
-Why are you letting me live?
-I'm borrowing you.

01:04:28.450 --> 01:04:33.365
-We're going to take a little journey.
-Beaver never hurt a soul. You killed him.

01:04:33.570 --> 01:04:37.199
He had nothing in his head.
I've found something useful in yours.

01:04:37.570 --> 01:04:40.482
-Fuck you!
-I know what that expression means.

01:04:40.650 --> 01:04:43.847
I've studied the foul language section
of your memory warehouse.

01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:45.921
Rather distasteful, I must say.

01:04:46.090 --> 01:04:49.082
How about this, Mr. Gray?
Eat shit and die.

01:04:52.210 --> 01:04:54.360
Why did you call me Mr. Gray?

01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:57.363
Watch out for Ister Gay.

01:04:57.890 --> 01:05:01.565
Someone told you about me.
Who told you about me?

01:05:01.770 --> 01:05:04.125
If you want to know,
why don't you read my mind?

01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:07.004
Surprisingly,
you're able to keep things from me...

01:05:07.170 --> 01:05:10.242
...I don't understand it.
But I'm sure I'll figure it out soon.

01:05:30.370 --> 01:05:31.962
Oh, Pete, Jesus!

01:05:32.130 --> 01:05:34.690
Motherfucker tried to bite
my dick off, Jonesy.

01:05:34.850 --> 01:05:37.239
I always thought it would be my ex-wife
did that.

01:05:38.370 --> 01:05:40.520
Let's get you to some help.

01:05:42.850 --> 01:05:45.080
Can you still see the line, buddy?

01:05:45.850 --> 01:05:50.366
-I don't need it to get to Gosselin's.
-No, I know that, but...

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:54.603
...if we didn't want to go to Gosselin's,
how would you get us out to 95?

01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:58.888
95? Who gives a shit?
I'm hurting here, Jonesy.

01:06:01.610 --> 01:06:03.168
What's wrong with you?

01:06:05.890 --> 01:06:08.245
-Wait a minute, you're not--
-Shut up, Pete.

01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:10.685
You're too messed up
to know what you're saying.

01:06:10.850 --> 01:06:15.128
Too late for that. Pete, I need you
to get onto the snowmobile right now.

01:06:15.330 --> 01:06:18.686
Who the fuck are you? You sound
like one of those James Bonds!

01:06:18.850 --> 01:06:22.206
This has to do with the fucking eel,
doesn't it? You're not--

01:06:27.610 --> 01:06:31.444
Stop it! I'll get him to help.
Pete, tell him what he wants to know.

01:06:40.970 --> 01:06:45.885
Now, Pete, which way to l-95?
I need to go to Massachusetts.

01:07:06.250 --> 01:07:09.322
My, my. That is a gift.

01:07:10.130 --> 01:07:11.802
Who taught you that?

01:07:17.050 --> 01:07:19.166
You're gonna be a big help, Pete.

01:07:21.610 --> 01:07:23.282
Climb aboard.

01:07:39.010 --> 01:07:41.922
Show's over. Let me in.
-Let me in.

01:07:42.090 --> 01:07:45.526
What have you got
in that part of your mind, professor?

01:07:45.690 --> 01:07:49.080
Your memories are out here
in the warehouse, aren't they?

01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:53.084
I want to know who warned you about
me. And who taught Pete that trick?

01:07:53.250 --> 01:07:56.606
I'm sure the answers are here.
It'll just take me a while to find them.

01:07:56.770 --> 01:07:58.681
-To find them.
-Think about letting me in.

01:07:58.850 --> 01:08:01.728
-It's the polite thing to do.
-Polite thing to do.

01:09:02.729 --> 01:09:04.482
Beav!

01:09:37.930 --> 01:09:39.488
What is this?

01:10:07.650 --> 01:10:09.880
Oh, Beav.

01:10:10.970 --> 01:10:12.642
Shit!

01:10:16.770 --> 01:10:18.806
Fuck me, Freddy.

01:11:09.570 --> 01:11:11.879
Oh, shit.

01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:31.202
Asshole!

01:13:42.610 --> 01:13:45.886
So long, Beav. Love you, man.

01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:02.769
We all made them in art.

01:14:02.930 --> 01:14:05.046
I finished first. I made one for Duds.

01:14:05.210 --> 01:14:07.963
Mine's deformed.
I couldn't figure out the string.

01:14:09.010 --> 01:14:14.209
-Eaver, Henny, Ownzy, Eet!
-That's right, my man.

01:14:14.930 --> 01:14:16.443
I Duddits.

01:14:17.170 --> 01:14:19.923
-Yes. I Duddits.
-I Duddits!

01:14:20.890 --> 01:14:23.165
I Duddits!

01:14:25.650 --> 01:14:27.641
Duds will find her.
How?

01:14:27.810 --> 01:14:30.404
He can do anything.
She's from the Academy.

01:14:30.570 --> 01:14:33.562
-She always waves.
-We've gotta save this girl.

01:14:36.130 --> 01:14:39.327
-Save this world?
-Not the world, Duds. A girl.

01:14:39.490 --> 01:14:42.209
-We'll save the world some other time.
-Ister Gay?

01:14:42.370 --> 01:14:44.645
-Yeah, it's a mystery.
-We need you to solve it.

01:14:44.810 --> 01:14:47.199
-Dreamcatcher. Duds'll read our minds.
Not this.

01:14:47.370 --> 01:14:49.167
Shut up. We gotta think of Josie.

01:14:49.330 --> 01:14:51.480
Josie, Josie, Josie.

01:14:52.770 --> 01:14:55.364
"Josie Rinkenhauer."

01:15:48.450 --> 01:15:51.999
-Josie?
-That's right. Can you find Josie?

01:16:31.850 --> 01:16:34.523
This is completely crazy.
-You can say that again.

01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:36.999
-I didn't say anything.
You did. I heard you.

01:16:37.170 --> 01:16:41.243
-You said, "This is completely crazy."
-I didn't say that.

01:16:42.170 --> 01:16:44.081
I thought it.

01:16:44.970 --> 01:16:49.998
Kiss my bender. Duds can hear
people's thoughts. We can't.

01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:51.809
Are you sure of that, Beav?

01:17:35.370 --> 01:17:38.328
Hey, guys! She's down here for sure!

01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:51.643
Josie, you down there?

01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:56.121
Josie! Josie!

01:17:58.530 --> 01:18:00.725
Fuck me, Freddy, she's down there.

01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:04.519
I know it. I can see her in my head.

01:18:04.690 --> 01:18:07.284
-Yeah.
-Me too.

01:18:07.810 --> 01:18:10.847
Help! Please!

01:18:11.010 --> 01:18:14.366
-Help me.
Hold on, Josie, we're coming!

01:18:14.530 --> 01:18:16.805
Josie, hang in there!

01:18:22.410 --> 01:18:24.207
Don't sing.
She's scared enough.

01:18:24.370 --> 01:18:28.921
Shut up. There's, like, rat shit.
Hold on to my feet!

01:18:29.410 --> 01:18:31.207
Pete, do you see anything?

01:18:32.090 --> 01:18:37.084
Duds! We got her!
-Here's Josie.

01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:11.689
Blue Boy leader.
How we doing, bucko?

01:19:12.810 --> 01:19:17.884
-Right here, boss. Fast and hard.
-Wouldn't have it any other way.

01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:21.082
Sir?

01:19:23.330 --> 01:19:25.082
I see it.

01:19:37.210 --> 01:19:39.007
Don't hurt us.
We're dying.

01:19:39.170 --> 01:19:41.559
There is no infection here.
-Whose radio is that?

01:19:41.770 --> 01:19:44.568
It's not the radio.
They're putting it into our heads.

01:19:44.770 --> 01:19:46.840
We are helpless.
-There it is, gentlemen.

01:19:47.010 --> 01:19:50.207
There's no infection here.
-Directly into our heads.

01:19:50.530 --> 01:19:52.885
This gives you an idea
what we're up against.

01:19:54.810 --> 01:19:57.722
If anybody's thinking,
"Those poor, helpless little folk...

01:19:57.890 --> 01:20:01.849
...all naked and unarmed beside
their crashed intergalactic Winnebago...

01:20:02.010 --> 01:20:04.888
...what kind of a dog,
what kind of a monster...

01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:07.689
...could hear that heartbreak
and go in just the same?"

01:20:07.850 --> 01:20:12.765
-Well, I'm that dog. I'm that monster.
We are helpless. We are dying.

01:20:12.930 --> 01:20:15.649
These mothers are as harmless
as a fox in a henhouse.

01:20:15.810 --> 01:20:18.529
And I'm here to kick some ass!
Are you with me?

01:20:18.690 --> 01:20:20.442
-Yes, boss!
-Roger that, boss.

01:20:20.650 --> 01:20:21.765
Right on, boss.

01:20:22.810 --> 01:20:24.801
Don't hurt us.

01:20:29.050 --> 01:20:30.768
I have a visual.

01:20:33.690 --> 01:20:35.362
Holy shit!

01:20:35.530 --> 01:20:37.407
Damn, look at the size of that.

01:20:38.810 --> 01:20:43.201
Blue Boy group, this is Blue Boy leader.
Target imminent. Go to level 4 readiness.

01:20:43.370 --> 01:20:45.440
Gentlemen, lock and load.

01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:48.604
Hellfires are hot.

01:20:50.210 --> 01:20:51.438
Sing it out, Owen!

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:57.243
Blue Boy group, this is Blue Boy leader.
Clean up the forest, get rid of this trash!

01:20:57.410 --> 01:20:59.924
Don't hurt us.
Please, don't hurt us.

01:21:00.090 --> 01:21:03.002
There is no infection here.
We are helpless.

01:21:03.330 --> 01:21:05.685
-Fire at will!
Fire!

01:22:15.970 --> 01:22:17.881
Owen, get them out of there!

01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:20.284
It's gonna blow!

01:22:20.770 --> 01:22:24.285
Blue Boy group, withdraw at once.
I repeat, cease firing and back off!

01:22:24.450 --> 01:22:26.680
-We can get them!
It's self-destructing.

01:22:27.090 --> 01:22:29.809
-Blue Boy group, get out of there!
-We're on top of it!

01:22:30.690 --> 01:22:32.487
Owen, pull out now!

01:22:32.650 --> 01:22:35.847
Pull out! Get out of there!
-Pull out!

01:23:01.530 --> 01:23:06.365
Jonesy, I've been thinking
about our friend. Our Scooby-Doo buddy.

01:23:06.970 --> 01:23:10.519
For a long time I thought he was sent
to us to warn us about something.

01:23:10.810 --> 01:23:13.643
-I could never figure what it was.
Don't talk about him.

01:23:13.810 --> 01:23:17.883
Not till today.
It was this, right now.

01:23:18.570 --> 01:23:23.644
-He wanted to warn us.
Tell me about your friend.

01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:28.600
-Did he show you that nifty trick?
No. Jonesy's right.

01:23:29.010 --> 01:23:32.923
Come on, Pete. Let's talk.
-Bite my bag, motherfucker!

01:23:36.650 --> 01:23:41.724
All right, Pete, I'll bite.
Your bag and everything else.

01:23:45.490 --> 01:23:48.527
No, no! You bastard! No!

01:23:57.090 --> 01:23:58.967
Pete.

01:24:45.930 --> 01:24:48.160
Don't talk to him!
Get out of there!

01:24:50.050 --> 01:24:51.039
Ah.

01:24:52.370 --> 01:24:54.838
-What's up?
-Thank God you came by, governor.

01:24:55.170 --> 01:24:57.638
I'm broke down here
and fearing for my life.

01:24:58.290 --> 01:24:59.848
That's a good-looking dog.

01:25:00.010 --> 01:25:02.001
-Where you headed?
-Gosselin's.

01:25:02.170 --> 01:25:04.638
Any chance you're going near there?

01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:06.762
That's where I'm going.

01:25:07.650 --> 01:25:11.165
Well, I believe your tailgate
has come open.

01:25:17.410 --> 01:25:19.048
Let's take a look.

01:25:26.410 --> 01:25:29.402
I see you have some cargo
you're taking to Blue Base.

01:25:52.290 --> 01:25:54.565
Got a treat for you, Ike.

01:25:57.410 --> 01:26:01.847
All you can eat.
Eat all the red stuff.

01:26:03.450 --> 01:26:08.922
Good doggy. Yes.
Good boy.

01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:13.603
Have your fill.
Tasty, tasty.

01:26:13.770 --> 01:26:15.044
Eat all you want--

01:26:18.610 --> 01:26:23.047
Jonesy.
What are you up to?

01:26:56.930 --> 01:26:58.249
Jonesy!

01:27:18.410 --> 01:27:20.082
Oh, God!

01:28:10.290 --> 01:28:14.203
Halt or we'll fire!
You cannot leave the quarantine zone!

01:28:14.370 --> 01:28:16.440
-Halt!
-I think I just about halted here.

01:28:21.850 --> 01:28:23.329
Come with me, Owen.

01:28:23.490 --> 01:28:26.368
I'll show you things
you'll wish you'd never seen.

01:28:40.970 --> 01:28:43.609
How long we gotta be here?
It'll be all right.

01:28:47.970 --> 01:28:51.440
I demand to see my lawyer!
-There must be something they can do.

01:28:53.650 --> 01:28:55.163
Don't worry, you'll be fine.

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:57.560
When do we get out?
Within hours.

01:28:57.730 --> 01:29:01.769
-You can't do this to people in America!
I told you to stay over there!

01:29:01.930 --> 01:29:04.285
-My wife--
Government's doing what...

01:29:04.450 --> 01:29:07.362
...they can to get you out of here.
Don't worry. It's all right.

01:29:07.530 --> 01:29:09.998
We're doing everything
to make sure you're safe.

01:29:10.170 --> 01:29:12.923
We'll get you back to your homes
within hours.

01:29:22.130 --> 01:29:23.722
All clear.

01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:47.969
Can I help you, sir?
What's your name?

01:29:48.130 --> 01:29:52.009
-Henry. Dr. Henry Devlin.
-A doctor? Good.

01:29:52.170 --> 01:29:53.762
We need doctors in there.

01:29:55.570 --> 01:29:58.004
Come on, laddie, I'll buy you a cup.

01:29:59.930 --> 01:30:04.367
-You, sir, where you from?
-Boston.

01:30:05.010 --> 01:30:10.368
Beantown? Great city.
We'll have you back there in no time.

01:30:10.530 --> 01:30:12.282
Maybe by morning.

01:30:13.330 --> 01:30:15.161
Hurry up, bucko.

01:30:25.210 --> 01:30:27.804
You see that crud on the faces
of children...

01:30:27.970 --> 01:30:31.963
...you know why I relish a turn
in the country like we had today.

01:30:32.890 --> 01:30:37.247
You were excellent out there, O.
It made me feel very proud to--

01:30:40.050 --> 01:30:43.725
Abe?
Abe, you okay?

01:30:45.090 --> 01:30:47.001
Abe?

01:30:49.490 --> 01:30:51.242
Yeah.

01:30:53.570 --> 01:30:58.690
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.
I must be getting too old for this shit.

01:30:59.810 --> 01:31:02.483
I don't know what the hell
that was about.

01:31:15.850 --> 01:31:18.080
It's the only way, Owen.

01:31:18.850 --> 01:31:21.410
We've got to cauterize the site.

01:31:22.970 --> 01:31:24.881
They've all got to die.

01:31:26.210 --> 01:31:27.768
It's the only way.

01:31:27.970 --> 01:31:29.722
But we don't know that.

01:31:29.890 --> 01:31:34.168
Studies point to the strong possibility
of recovery for many exposed subjects.

01:31:34.330 --> 01:31:36.924
The studies show squat,
that's what they show.

01:31:37.090 --> 01:31:40.207
If Matheson had been in my spot
for the last quarter-century...

01:31:40.370 --> 01:31:42.838
...you'd have never made
it to your first jerk-off.

01:31:43.290 --> 01:31:47.488
Those gray bastards would have had you
for lunch back in Armpit, Kentucky.

01:31:47.650 --> 01:31:50.847
Some get better. At least
half will be over it in a few days--

01:31:51.010 --> 01:31:53.080
Which ones, Mother Teresa?

01:31:53.250 --> 01:31:57.368
Can you guarantee they won't take it
home like a present for the family?

01:31:57.570 --> 01:32:01.279
I'll tell you what you should be worried
about. What should be on your mind.

01:32:01.450 --> 01:32:03.008
Not these few unfortunates.

01:32:03.490 --> 01:32:05.924
What you should be worried
about is a hitchhiker.

01:32:06.090 --> 01:32:07.489
-What?
-A hitchhiker.

01:32:07.650 --> 01:32:10.642
Our greatest fear is that a grayboy
would catch a ride...

01:32:10.810 --> 01:32:14.644
...with somebody and would carry them
out of here, without being consumed.

01:32:14.890 --> 01:32:17.802
To scatter the infection,
like Johnny-fucking-Appleseed.

01:32:17.970 --> 01:32:20.120
-Are you sure there isn't such a person?
-No.

01:32:20.290 --> 01:32:22.758
But I am sure that if there is one
he won't get out.

01:32:22.930 --> 01:32:25.524
Not with the net my boys
put up around the Blue Zone.

01:32:25.770 --> 01:32:28.284
And if we do a thorough job
on the ones we've got.

01:32:28.450 --> 01:32:30.600
If we don't get gooey
about the little picture...

01:32:30.770 --> 01:32:32.840
...when our job is taking care
of the big one.

01:32:33.490 --> 01:32:34.764
Capisce?

01:32:35.170 --> 01:32:38.958
Owen, if you think this is easy for me,
you're crazier than my mother was.

01:32:40.450 --> 01:32:42.008
Those poor schmucks.

01:32:42.770 --> 01:32:46.365
They drive Chevrolets,
shop at Wal-Mart...

01:32:46.530 --> 01:32:48.441
...never miss an episode of Friends.

01:32:49.490 --> 01:32:51.287
These are Americans.

01:32:52.930 --> 01:32:55.046
The idea of slaughtering Americans...

01:32:57.730 --> 01:32:59.880
...it just turns my stomach.

01:33:03.770 --> 01:33:07.809
But I'll do it.
I'll do it because it needs to be done.

01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:13.528
So if we start at 2, we can be done
by 2:30. And it's all behind us.

01:33:14.410 --> 01:33:16.321
Except for the dreams.

01:33:19.170 --> 01:33:21.479
Yeah, except for them.

01:33:33.250 --> 01:33:36.481
What are you gonna tell Rita
about what you did here?

01:33:36.770 --> 01:33:40.206
What are you gonna tell Katrina
when she's old enough to ask?

01:33:43.730 --> 01:33:46.528
You know me, don't you?
I don't remember when we met...

01:33:46.690 --> 01:33:48.123
...but you know me.

01:33:48.370 --> 01:33:52.124
We don't have time to screw around.
You've got two problems.

01:33:52.290 --> 01:33:55.441
-One you know about, one you don't.
-Go ahead.

01:33:56.010 --> 01:34:01.607
Your mentor, Colonel Curtis, he's gone
insane from hunting aliens for 25 years.

01:34:01.770 --> 01:34:05.604
Now he wants you to help him
kill hundreds of innocent people.

01:34:06.650 --> 01:34:08.561
-Who are you?
-Me?

01:34:08.730 --> 01:34:11.528
Talk about that later,
once we get out of here.

01:34:11.690 --> 01:34:13.646
-Hey.
-You're predictable.

01:34:13.810 --> 01:34:15.448
You won't let me burn on this fence...

01:34:15.610 --> 01:34:18.170
...any more than you'll help
Curtis kill those people.

01:34:18.330 --> 01:34:21.925
What you're thinking now is whether
that digital sat-scan transmitter...

01:34:22.090 --> 01:34:25.048
...in your duffle bag will
let you get through to somebody.

01:34:26.050 --> 01:34:30.726
-Somebody named General Matheson.
-Hmm.

01:34:32.050 --> 01:34:37.249
"Sometimes we have to kill,
but our real job is to save lives."

01:34:41.250 --> 01:34:43.445
Your father was a great soldier.

01:34:43.890 --> 01:34:45.289
Those were his last words.

01:34:45.450 --> 01:34:47.520
You carry his picture with you always.

01:34:50.530 --> 01:34:52.122
Tell me everything.

01:34:53.250 --> 01:34:55.081
You'll save these people.

01:34:55.250 --> 01:34:58.560
When we're done talking, get on the
transmitter, contact Matheson.

01:34:58.730 --> 01:34:59.958
Cavalry rides in.

01:35:00.130 --> 01:35:03.281
That takes care of problem number one.
Now comes the hard part.

01:35:03.450 --> 01:35:07.807
You think the infection's been contained,
that there's no hitchhiker.

01:35:07.970 --> 01:35:11.519
You're wrong. He's riding with
my best friend on earth.

01:35:11.690 --> 01:35:14.488
A guy named Gary Jones.
And he's out there.

01:35:15.010 --> 01:35:19.162
You and I don't get after him right away,
he'll get out of my range...

01:35:19.370 --> 01:35:22.203
...and some kind of shit
is gonna hit the planetary fan.

01:35:35.970 --> 01:35:38.040
Our nightmare hitchhiker.

01:35:38.610 --> 01:35:43.923
And all Dr. Mystery wants is a free pass
so he can catch his friend.

01:35:44.090 --> 01:35:47.207
-Very convenient.
-I'm saying you ought to hear his story.

01:35:47.610 --> 01:35:48.963
Okay. Where is he?

01:35:49.130 --> 01:35:50.848
Had him taken to the tractor shed.

01:35:51.330 --> 01:35:54.561
Okay. I'll check him out
and we can compare notes.

01:35:54.730 --> 01:35:56.368
Whatever you say, boss.

01:36:02.970 --> 01:36:06.201
Come on, come on. Time's a-wasting.

01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:17.806
All right, lad, open up.

01:36:35.490 --> 01:36:36.718
Dr. Boston?

01:36:38.050 --> 01:36:39.324
Are you in here?

01:36:40.690 --> 01:36:42.043
I'm here.

01:36:42.210 --> 01:36:43.484
Where I've been put.

01:36:44.610 --> 01:36:46.726
A prisoner on my own damn property.

01:36:51.330 --> 01:36:52.604
Let's go!

01:36:54.210 --> 01:36:55.563
Come on, let's go.

01:37:01.930 --> 01:37:03.443
Get in!

01:37:05.450 --> 01:37:07.122
You almost ran me down.

01:37:07.290 --> 01:37:10.043
Figured you'd read my mind
and get out of the way.

01:37:13.050 --> 01:37:17.680
Blue Unit, stand down.
You are under regular Army command.

01:37:17.850 --> 01:37:19.761
-Put down your weapons at once.
-Get down!

01:37:20.770 --> 01:37:23.204
Your mission is rescinded.

01:37:23.370 --> 01:37:26.567
This is no longer a Blue Unit operation.

01:37:26.730 --> 01:37:31.645
Put down your arms.
Repeat, put down your arms.

01:37:31.810 --> 01:37:34.927
General Matheson
has assumed command.

01:37:43.930 --> 01:37:45.124
Okay, Owen.

01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:46.998
Okay.

01:37:47.690 --> 01:37:50.682
You just drove over the Curtis line.

01:37:52.770 --> 01:37:54.567
-Where we going?
-South.

01:37:54.730 --> 01:37:57.403
All I know right now.
Just get me in range of Jonesy...

01:37:57.570 --> 01:37:59.367
...we'll know everything
we need to know.

01:38:22.130 --> 01:38:24.803
That's some gun.
Can I have a look?

01:38:31.810 --> 01:38:35.007
-Kind of flashy for a guy like you.
-It's a gift.

01:38:35.170 --> 01:38:36.762
I know.

01:38:38.850 --> 01:38:40.283
Where are you, Jonesy?

01:38:40.450 --> 01:38:43.362
Pick up the phone. Call 1-800-HENRY.

01:38:59.210 --> 01:39:01.087
Hello? Jonesy!

01:39:01.250 --> 01:39:04.765
Jesus Christ, I knew it was you.
Where's he taking you?

01:39:05.530 --> 01:39:07.646
Massachusetts? He is?

01:39:07.930 --> 01:39:11.320
Duddits? Okay, I will.
You hang in there, Jonesy.

01:39:11.490 --> 01:39:12.718
Jonesy?

01:39:13.370 --> 01:39:14.689
He hung up.

01:39:15.770 --> 01:39:17.362
Give me back my gun.

01:39:19.530 --> 01:39:21.885
-We gotta go to Derry.
-That where they're going?

01:39:22.050 --> 01:39:25.042
No, they're going towards
Massachusetts. We need Duddits.

01:39:25.210 --> 01:39:28.122
Jonesy says Mr. Gray
is afraid of Duddits.

01:39:28.290 --> 01:39:32.169
Your buddy, he's still alive
after all this time with Mr. Gray?

01:39:32.330 --> 01:39:35.049
Yeah, he's immune.
I think it's because he died.

01:39:36.730 --> 01:39:40.723
He got hit by a car
and his heart stopped. Twice.

01:39:40.890 --> 01:39:42.642
I don't think he even knows it.

01:39:42.970 --> 01:39:46.360
He came back from the dead.
Must have changed him somehow.

01:39:48.010 --> 01:39:52.367
It's almost like Duddits saw
this whole thing coming. Is that it?

01:39:54.650 --> 01:39:58.404
Jonesy told me it was Duddits
who drew him into the accident.

01:39:58.570 --> 01:40:01.084
If we catch him,
we're gonna have to kill him.

01:40:01.450 --> 01:40:04.886
You know we have to do it.
It's the only way to stop Mr. Gray...

01:40:05.410 --> 01:40:07.366
...assuming we can catch him.

01:40:10.370 --> 01:40:12.645
When was the last time
you saw Duddits?

01:40:12.810 --> 01:40:14.368
Long time ago.

01:40:15.450 --> 01:40:16.769
Years.

01:40:18.170 --> 01:40:20.320
What makes you so sure he can help?

01:40:20.890 --> 01:40:22.448
Duddits can do anything.

01:40:23.370 --> 01:40:27.488
I didn't understand that then,
but I think it's always been true.

01:40:28.170 --> 01:40:30.559
He's the one who made us like this.

01:40:30.730 --> 01:40:33.403
-Like what?
-You know, weird.

01:40:49.010 --> 01:40:50.523
He's been waiting for you.

01:40:50.690 --> 01:40:52.009
Blizzard slowed us up.

01:40:52.170 --> 01:40:54.240
Henny, Henny.

01:40:55.330 --> 01:40:56.763
Henny.

01:41:01.330 --> 01:41:03.446
I miss you, Henny.

01:41:03.610 --> 01:41:05.487
I miss you.

01:41:07.970 --> 01:41:09.483
Henny.

01:41:09.730 --> 01:41:13.848
Long time, Henny. Henny.

01:41:16.930 --> 01:41:20.923
My God, Roberta, what is it?
Lymphocytic leukemia.

01:41:23.850 --> 01:41:28.128
I'm gonna let you take him,
but I have to tell you why.

01:41:29.130 --> 01:41:31.644
Just now, when he was getting ready...

01:41:33.450 --> 01:41:36.726
...Henry, he was so excited.

01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:39.643
Like he hasn't been in such a long time.

01:41:46.410 --> 01:41:48.128
I think...

01:41:48.290 --> 01:41:51.680
...that if he's with you,
he might die happy...

01:41:52.130 --> 01:41:54.360
...instead of in this awful room.

01:41:56.770 --> 01:42:00.126
Be sure the parka stays on tight.
Cold devastates him.

01:42:01.090 --> 01:42:04.127
The medication and instructions
are in here.

01:42:05.410 --> 01:42:06.889
Bye, Mom.

01:42:19.650 --> 01:42:22.687
Goodbye, Duddie. Be a good boy.

01:42:24.730 --> 01:42:26.960
Now, go save the world.

01:42:54.810 --> 01:42:56.368
All right, laddie.

01:42:56.570 --> 01:43:00.119
They haven't got enough courage
to take my trailer. Not yet, anyway.

01:43:00.290 --> 01:43:01.439
What've we got?

01:43:01.610 --> 01:43:06.525
They're leaving Derry, Maine, heading
south on 95. Toward Massachusetts.

01:43:06.690 --> 01:43:08.009
Massachusetts?

01:43:10.090 --> 01:43:11.762
Stay with it, bucko.

01:43:23.810 --> 01:43:25.880
General Matheson. Come in, please.

01:43:29.370 --> 01:43:30.849
This is very nice, Abe.

01:43:31.010 --> 01:43:33.365
Been home through some rough times.

01:43:33.570 --> 01:43:35.925
Was there something we hadn't covered?

01:43:36.290 --> 01:43:39.999
I don't think I got to say before how
much I respect the work you've done.

01:43:40.170 --> 01:43:41.967
It was with sincere regret--

01:43:42.130 --> 01:43:44.246
Herman-- May I call you Herman?

01:43:44.850 --> 01:43:49.002
We may not agree on all the strategic
initiatives, but we do agree on this:

01:43:49.170 --> 01:43:53.641
I'm past it. Burned out.
Just needed a push, that's all.

01:43:53.930 --> 01:43:56.398
Should have quit
after that mess in Montana.

01:43:58.890 --> 01:44:01.358
Even I don't trust my judgment anymore.

01:44:02.850 --> 01:44:04.249
Oh, yeah....

01:44:04.410 --> 01:44:08.198
My techies tell me we're getting some
electronics reading hot from in here.

01:44:08.530 --> 01:44:11.647
Yes, I've been talking
to the wife on my sat phone.

01:44:11.810 --> 01:44:15.803
I don't know if you've ever met Barbara.
She's been after me for years to retire.

01:44:15.970 --> 01:44:20.282
She's very happy, I can tell you that. I'll
have everything shut down in an hour.

01:44:20.490 --> 01:44:23.209
If that's soon enough.

01:44:23.770 --> 01:44:25.408
That will be fine.

01:45:11.370 --> 01:45:13.406
How do you turn off the goddamn lights?

01:45:13.570 --> 01:45:16.801
Maybe you shouldn't have been
so fast to kill that trooper.

01:45:16.970 --> 01:45:18.528
You're making yourself at home.

01:45:18.690 --> 01:45:22.205
You have no idea, Jonesy.
Tell me how you like this:

01:45:22.370 --> 01:45:26.841
"Maybe you shouldn't have been
so fast to kill that trooper." Not bad?

01:45:28.090 --> 01:45:29.728
Oh, don't like that, Gary, do you?

01:45:30.850 --> 01:45:34.320
Ownzy. He's in a police car now.

01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:36.922
He's in a police car now.

01:45:37.090 --> 01:45:38.842
Can you see where they are, Duds?

01:45:40.450 --> 01:45:43.487
Ownzy. He's in Ister Gay.

01:45:45.010 --> 01:45:46.443
Mr. Gray.

01:45:46.970 --> 01:45:49.086
That's right, Duds, he is in Mr. Gray.

01:45:49.250 --> 01:45:51.241
"Ister Gay" is Mr. Gray.

01:45:51.570 --> 01:45:52.923
We gotta save this girl.

01:45:53.890 --> 01:45:55.289
Save the world?

01:45:55.450 --> 01:45:58.840
Not the world, Duds, a girl.
We'll save the world some other time.

01:45:59.010 --> 01:45:59.999
Ister Gay?

01:46:03.490 --> 01:46:05.242
You already knew.

01:46:07.450 --> 01:46:09.202
Where's he going, Duds?

01:46:09.970 --> 01:46:14.725
Where is Mr. Gray taking Jonesy?
Duds?

01:46:28.290 --> 01:46:30.850
Ister Gay, he want war.

01:46:31.010 --> 01:46:33.399
-War?
-Not war, water.

01:46:34.450 --> 01:46:36.042
Mr. Gray wants water.

01:46:36.690 --> 01:46:37.884
I know where he's going.

01:46:38.050 --> 01:46:40.723
-He's going to the Quabbin Reservoir.
-What's Quabbin?

01:46:40.890 --> 01:46:43.358
It supplies drinking water
for all of Boston.

01:46:43.650 --> 01:46:46.608
-Hmm.
-What?

01:46:48.410 --> 01:46:50.970
One worm kills the world.

01:46:51.610 --> 01:46:53.965
One worm kills the world?

01:46:55.170 --> 01:46:58.207
Oh, my God. One worm.

01:46:58.370 --> 01:47:01.680
Back at our cabin, I saw the worms
that come out of these weasels.

01:47:01.850 --> 01:47:04.808
Mr. Gray must want to get one
into the Boston drinking supply.

01:47:07.570 --> 01:47:10.482
Just one worm infects the whole world?

01:47:12.450 --> 01:47:13.883
-Are we going right?
Yes.

01:47:14.050 --> 01:47:18.487
Take the 495 to the Mass Pike.
It's not far. You're doing great, buddy.

01:47:18.690 --> 01:47:22.524
Are you ready to try something hard?
I want to ask you something hard.

01:47:22.690 --> 01:47:24.169
Yes, Henny.

01:47:24.330 --> 01:47:28.642
Good. Can you talk to Jonesy?

01:47:29.410 --> 01:47:31.241
Can you make him hear you?

01:47:31.970 --> 01:47:33.562
Ownzy...

01:47:35.330 --> 01:47:37.764
...and Ister Gay.

01:47:39.050 --> 01:47:40.119
Duddits.

01:47:50.050 --> 01:47:54.043
I knew it. I knew it.
He's been here all along.

01:47:54.210 --> 01:47:55.484
Waiting.

01:47:56.130 --> 01:48:00.248
Jonesy? It appears
we didn't meet by accident.

01:48:01.570 --> 01:48:04.926
We owe it to our friend, Duddits.

01:48:05.130 --> 01:48:08.759
I don't know what you mean.
-No? Maybe not.

01:48:08.930 --> 01:48:12.286
Maybe your clever friend didn't want
you to know what he was up to.

01:48:12.450 --> 01:48:17.240
That's why you had nothing
in the warehouse about me.

01:48:18.530 --> 01:48:21.886
Duddits didn't bother to tell you
what job he had in mind for you.

01:48:23.490 --> 01:48:24.764
It doesn't matter.

01:48:26.970 --> 01:48:30.645
His little scheme didn't work.
Did it, Ike? No, no.

01:48:30.810 --> 01:48:32.084
We're almost there.

01:48:33.810 --> 01:48:36.040
What was it your poetry file had to say?

01:48:36.730 --> 01:48:40.120
I have promises to keep
And miles to go before I sleep

01:48:43.410 --> 01:48:47.483
And miles to go before I sleep

01:49:08.090 --> 01:49:09.842
Stop that chopper!

01:49:38.050 --> 01:49:39.802
Punch it, dude. Don't be a pussy.

01:49:42.730 --> 01:49:44.129
Thank you, Gary Jones.

01:50:01.970 --> 01:50:03.801
Go up around the reservoir.

01:50:04.370 --> 01:50:06.725
Aqueduct to Boston starts in Shaft 12.

01:50:29.410 --> 01:50:31.526
Patience, bambino.

01:50:31.690 --> 01:50:33.840
Just up ahead.

01:50:48.090 --> 01:50:50.206
Shh....

01:51:59.490 --> 01:52:02.607
Stay here and take care of your friend.

01:52:03.250 --> 01:52:05.445
No matter what you hear.

01:52:21.370 --> 01:52:22.723
So long, doctor.

01:52:36.250 --> 01:52:38.366
Good doggy.

01:52:38.530 --> 01:52:40.122
Good girl.

01:54:31.970 --> 01:54:33.244
Shit!

01:54:33.850 --> 01:54:35.442
You son of a bitch!

01:54:55.130 --> 01:54:56.722
Wait.

01:54:56.970 --> 01:54:58.244
Wait.

01:55:29.130 --> 01:55:31.121
Go back to car, Duddie.

01:55:31.290 --> 01:55:32.928
You'll be safer there.

01:56:16.130 --> 01:56:17.404
Look out, Jonesy.

01:56:43.250 --> 01:56:45.639
I knew you'd come, Henry.

01:56:46.490 --> 01:56:48.287
I knew you wouldn't let me die.

01:56:48.770 --> 01:56:51.284
Who the fuck are you?

01:56:55.010 --> 01:56:58.047
-Don't you know me, H?
-I don't know.

01:57:00.330 --> 01:57:03.083
I think I'm gonna have to shoot you.

01:57:03.250 --> 01:57:04.478
Just to be sure.

01:57:07.970 --> 01:57:10.484
Well, maybe you're right, my friend.

01:57:11.290 --> 01:57:14.407
I don't know myself if Mr. Gray is gone.

01:57:15.370 --> 01:57:18.203
He could be hiding in here somewhere...

01:57:19.250 --> 01:57:21.081
...waiting for his chance.

01:57:36.290 --> 01:57:39.009
Tell me something Mr. Gray
couldn't possibly know.

01:57:41.090 --> 01:57:43.160
Tell me something only we would know.

01:57:48.970 --> 01:57:51.006
SSDD.

01:57:55.570 --> 01:57:57.208
Not good enough.

01:58:00.970 --> 01:58:04.406
Well, you decide. Ask me anything.

01:58:18.450 --> 01:58:24.719
At Tracker Brothers,
day we met Duddits...

01:58:26.370 --> 01:58:28.804
...what was painted
on the wall by the window?

01:58:41.570 --> 01:58:42.798
No...

01:58:46.090 --> 01:58:47.284
...bounce....

01:58:57.010 --> 01:58:58.363
No play.

01:59:01.730 --> 01:59:03.482
Hello...

01:59:03.970 --> 01:59:05.244
...Ister Gay.

01:59:39.690 --> 01:59:40.918
You.

01:59:41.210 --> 01:59:43.770
Ooby-Ooby-Doo...

01:59:44.610 --> 01:59:46.840
...we got some work to do now.

01:59:59.650 --> 02:00:01.845
Ister Gay...

02:00:02.450 --> 02:00:04.122
...go away.

02:00:40.450 --> 02:00:42.406
No!

02:01:03.250 --> 02:01:05.605
I Duddits.

02:02:26.050 --> 02:02:27.165
H?

02:02:43.810 --> 02:02:45.038
Jonesy.

02:02:50.850 --> 02:02:54.525
Jonesy, if that really is your name....

02:03:00.490 --> 02:03:02.924
-That'll be 50 small.
Bullshit.

02:03:05.450 --> 02:03:07.680
I Duddits.
I Duddits.

02:03:07.850 --> 02:03:10.125
They're my friends.
We're all best friends.

02:03:10.290 --> 02:03:13.441
Here's to Duddits, our dreamcatcher.
