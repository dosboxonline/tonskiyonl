WEBVTT

00:04.656 --> 00:08.008
- Ah!
There you are.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.751
You good, ancestors?

00:12.795 --> 00:14.449
I don't want to think
about what Nate and Zari

00:14.492 --> 00:16.103
were doing in there
to make you fall off my wrist

00:16.146 --> 00:17.756
in the middle of the night.

00:17.800 --> 00:19.541
<i>- Actually,
after several rounds of me</i>

00:19.584 --> 00:21.108
<i>kicking your butt in
"Mortal Kombat,"</i>

00:21.151 --> 00:22.500
<i>you complained
of your Totem being--</i>

00:22.544 --> 00:24.546
- Being too tight
on my gaming arm.

00:24.589 --> 00:27.070
So I loosened it up a little.

00:27.114 --> 00:28.854
Oh, thank goodness!

00:28.898 --> 00:30.856
That's why you spent the night
underneath the couch.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.206
Oh.

00:32.249 --> 00:33.511
<i>- Before you go, B,</i>

00:33.555 --> 00:34.904
<i>I have an important message.</i>

00:34.947 --> 00:36.253
- It's cool, G.

00:36.297 --> 00:38.255
We can skip
my morning horoscope.

00:38.299 --> 00:41.302
Running late for another team
meeting and misplacing my Totem?

00:41.345 --> 00:44.740
Couldn't be more obvious
that Mercury's in retrograde.

00:44.783 --> 00:46.350
<i>- According to
the Temporal Chronometer,</i>

00:46.394 --> 00:48.700
<i>today is your birthday.</i>

00:48.744 --> 00:51.529
- Whoa.
I'm a quarter century!

00:51.573 --> 00:54.054
<i>- Happy birthday!</i>

00:54.097 --> 00:55.403
<i>- Okay!</i>

00:55.446 --> 00:57.100
Thanks to Kayla's pod tracker,

00:57.144 --> 00:59.189
we have a new advantage
in preventing

00:59.233 --> 01:01.365
displaced aliens
from screwing with the timeline.

01:01.409 --> 01:02.932
- Gideon,
can you please run a scan?

01:02.975 --> 01:04.455
<i>- Right away,
Co-Captain Sharpe.</i>

01:06.196 --> 01:08.198
- All right, well, I'm all in,
'cause mind-melding

01:08.242 --> 01:11.288
with that giant sandworm
left me with a nasty migraine.

01:11.332 --> 01:12.942
But...

01:12.985 --> 01:14.813
I suped-up my <i>pequeña amiga</i>

01:14.857 --> 01:17.555
with a special surprise
for the next space vermin.

01:17.599 --> 01:20.123
- No need for surprises, guys.

01:20.167 --> 01:21.777
- Uh, called it!
Shows up late,

01:21.820 --> 01:23.126
wearing the clothes
that he slept in,

01:23.170 --> 01:24.997
but still had time
for breakfast,

01:25.041 --> 01:28.523
which means I am out of bathroom
cleaning rotation for a month.

01:28.566 --> 01:29.698
- Ugh.
- Hey.

01:29.741 --> 01:31.352
Yeah, no surprises,

01:31.395 --> 01:33.745
just slowly losing
all of our free will to Astra.

01:33.789 --> 01:35.791
- Oh, good.
'Cause who needs surprises

01:35.834 --> 01:38.489
when smoking a few bowls,
watching your favorite sitcom

01:38.533 --> 01:40.709
on Bestflix
with friends and fam will do?

01:40.752 --> 01:43.146
- Mm, that sounds like
a very romantic evening

01:43.190 --> 01:45.105
for you and Nate, but, oh,
yeah, that's right.

01:45.148 --> 01:46.671
We don't know which
of our Totems he decided

01:46.715 --> 01:48.282
to have his sleepover in. <i>
- Pardon me,</i>

01:48.325 --> 01:49.761
<i>but the pod's projected path</i>

01:49.805 --> 01:52.547
<i>is Vancouver, British Columbia,
2023.</i>

01:52.590 --> 01:54.157
- All right, everybody!

01:54.201 --> 01:56.551
Put on your, uh, toques
and Canada Goose,

01:56.594 --> 01:59.119
because we are going
to the third-largest

01:59.162 --> 02:01.817
metropolitan area in Canada!
Ah!

02:03.993 --> 02:06.561
- Oh, "Raincouver," babe,
it was right there.

02:06.604 --> 02:08.389
- But it made sense!
It's, like...

02:08.432 --> 02:09.955
- It's okay.
- Accurate information.

02:09.999 --> 02:11.696
Oh, Zari!
You might just wanna call Nate.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.176
Because even in
the preventing business,

02:13.220 --> 02:14.743
we could still use
all hands on deck.

02:14.786 --> 02:15.831
- Got it, girl.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.231
<i>- Dad?</i>

02:24.274 --> 02:26.233
<i>Dad, is that you?
Are you okay?</i>

02:26.276 --> 02:29.540
- Yeah.
Why wouldn't I be?

02:29.584 --> 02:31.890
<i>- I need to see you right now.
Where are you?</i>

02:31.934 --> 02:34.632
- Uh, hold on!
I keep losing track

02:34.676 --> 02:36.852
of my stupid portal thingy.

02:36.895 --> 02:38.593
I'll grab one.

02:39.159 --> 02:40.725
-
Not how I thought

02:40.769 --> 02:42.553
my day would go,
but it's all good.

02:42.597 --> 02:44.294
The universe has bigger plans.

02:44.338 --> 02:45.991
- What's so special about today?

02:46.035 --> 02:48.037
- It's a day that only
comes around once a year.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.734
- Aw, cute affirmation.

02:49.778 --> 02:52.389
Anyway, if these "baecations"
between Nate and 1.0

02:52.433 --> 02:54.478
are gonna become the "ushe,"
we need to work out a schedule.

02:54.522 --> 02:56.219
I did not sleep a wink
this weekend

02:56.263 --> 02:57.568
because I was afraid
he was just gonna

02:57.612 --> 02:59.222
sneak attack
and pop out of the Totem.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.616
- Look, I want Nate back
today of all days.

03:01.659 --> 03:02.660
Hey, Mick.
- Hey, Mick.

03:02.704 --> 03:03.792
- But we don't know

03:03.835 --> 03:04.836
what's going on in the Totem.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.011
What if he's, you know,

03:06.055 --> 03:07.274
<i>in flagrante delicto?</i>

03:07.317 --> 03:08.623

Do you not care that he's doing

03:10.015 --> 03:12.104
God knows what on your wrist?

03:18.546 --> 03:19.851
- Really?
Come on, guys.

03:19.895 --> 03:21.201

- I di--no!

03:21.244 --> 03:22.724

03:22.767 --> 03:24.943
Oh! Huh?
- Yep. Yeah.

03:24.987 --> 03:26.641

- Uh-huh.

03:26.684 --> 03:28.033

we time-jumped to 2023.

04:01.066 --> 04:02.372
You opened a portal

Lita, honey!
It's so good to see you.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.463
You look beautiful,
congratulations!

04:06.507 --> 04:08.726
- Thanks, Aunt Ava.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.162

04:13.340 --> 04:16.212
Yes, refereed by Auntie Ava.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.736

You're gonna be a grandpappy!

and got yourself knocked up!

04:28.006 --> 04:30.313

04:30.357 --> 04:31.880
What do you call
what you did with mom

04:31.923 --> 04:33.708
in my high school gym
supply closet?

04:33.751 --> 04:35.797
- Conceiving.
- Really?

04:35.840 --> 04:37.494
- I haven't see you
in over a year,

04:37.538 --> 04:38.843
you don't answer
any of my calls,

04:38.887 --> 04:40.323

04:40.367 --> 04:42.020
- What the hell are you talking
about?

04:42.064 --> 04:43.370
- You know what, here I thought

04:43.413 --> 04:44.501
the worst had happened,

04:44.545 --> 04:45.676
and that my baby would never

04:45.720 --> 04:47.069
get to meet their grandfather,

04:47.112 --> 04:48.505
but it turns out
I was only half right,

04:48.549 --> 04:51.073
because you're totally fine.

04:51.116 --> 04:52.901
And you're still
the same Mick Rory.

04:52.944 --> 04:54.511
A deadbeat.

I am not a deadbeat!

Come back here, young lady!

04:59.255 --> 05:00.996
- Yeah, okay, okay, okay.
Maybe let's just try

05:01.039 --> 05:02.954
a little less shouting
and a lot more listening

05:02.998 --> 05:04.304
so that we can figure out
why you disappeared

05:04.347 --> 05:05.522
from your daughter's life, Mick.

05:05.566 --> 05:07.481

It doesn't look popular.

it only lasted two seasons.

In high school, Behrad
used to stay up all night,

Within pop culture,

06:56.328 --> 06:58.243
"Bud Stuy" had more of
a cult following.

06:58.287 --> 06:59.767
- Oh.
Sounds like a lame cult.

06:59.810 --> 07:02.160
People with low ambition
going nowhere in life.

- Ooh.

07:04.075 --> 07:05.903
It wasn't like any of us were
saving the world

07:05.947 --> 07:07.427
when we were in high school.

07:07.470 --> 07:09.559

I was becoming

07:09.603 --> 07:11.605

a Fortune 500 company.

- But it's your birthday,
so who's keeping track?

07:14.869 --> 07:16.610
- Figured it was
stressful enough having

07:16.653 --> 07:18.786
one global superstar
in the fam-bam.

07:18.829 --> 07:20.701
"Bud Stuy's" charm was
that it wasn't trying

07:20.744 --> 07:22.224
to appeal to everyone.

07:22.267 --> 07:23.878
But it meant a lot to me.

Just play something young

It's up to me to follow it.

Damn.

08:53.924 --> 08:56.405
- Sleeping gummies, reading
gummies, naughty gummies.

get mixed up with
the prop stash again?

09:55.986 --> 09:57.684

10:03.385 --> 10:04.516
- That was a classic!

10:08.608 --> 10:10.000
- And cut!

10:13.874 --> 10:16.920
- So this "surprise"
is really starting to give off

10:16.964 --> 10:19.923
an "improvised lie
that backfired" vibe.

10:19.967 --> 10:21.664
- Listen--
- It's cool!

10:21.708 --> 10:23.492
Little tropey, but,

10:23.535 --> 10:25.886
guess we're doing
a sitcom mission.

10:35.460 --> 10:37.114
- Hey, little guy.

10:37.158 --> 10:40.422
Yeah, yeah, you.
Yeah, the camera loves you.

10:40.465 --> 10:42.076
Just come on over.

10:43.599 --> 10:45.122
- Come here, little guy.

10:45.166 --> 10:47.037
You're ruining one
of my favorite episodes.

10:47.081 --> 10:49.431
- Look, Kam.

10:49.474 --> 10:51.563
I know we've had
our creative disagreements,

10:51.607 --> 10:54.523
but crashing the taping
with an animatronic alien?

10:54.566 --> 10:56.699
- Right.

10:56.743 --> 10:59.571
Hey, buddy.
Come here.

10:59.615 --> 11:01.835
Wow.
Lookit, it's so cute.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.491
- It's okay, buddy.
It's okay.

11:06.535 --> 11:10.713
-
- There you go.

11:10.757 --> 11:13.150
Well, this animatronic alien
is adorable.

11:13.194 --> 11:14.717
And the audience ate it up.

11:14.761 --> 11:16.284
So if we're ever gonna be
more than a cult show

11:16.327 --> 11:17.851
we need a gag that's
a little less foreign.

11:17.894 --> 11:20.636
- Less foreign?
It's a freakin' alien, man.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.856
- I want broader appeal.
- You want less Muslim.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.640
- You don't know what religion
the alien is.

11:24.684 --> 11:27.469
- Okay.
This thing is freaking me out.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.514
The puppeteer
is going really method,

11:29.558 --> 11:32.213
because this thing
is way too lifelike.

11:32.256 --> 11:33.693
- Remember how we got here.

11:33.736 --> 11:35.564
I was your first audience.

11:35.607 --> 11:37.000
The one who encouraged you

11:37.044 --> 11:39.046
and drove you to
all your stand-up gigs.

11:39.089 --> 11:42.179
Have I ever steered you
wrong before?

11:46.357 --> 11:48.098
- Can we at least
reshoot the ending?

11:48.142 --> 11:49.839
Hell, get some VFX money,
make that crash

11:49.883 --> 11:50.971
look a little more convincing?

11:51.014 --> 11:52.668
- We'll fix it in post.

11:57.934 --> 12:00.589
- Aw.

12:00.632 --> 12:03.331
That things adorable.
See, Spooner?

12:03.374 --> 12:05.202
- Uh, I think I'm gonna
need a smaller gun.

12:05.246 --> 12:07.248
- Hey!
What are you still doing here?

12:07.291 --> 12:08.815
Come on.

12:08.858 --> 12:10.817
- Oh!
We're just--

12:10.860 --> 12:14.037
- Hi, buddy.
How's it going?

12:14.081 --> 12:15.169
Ow!

12:17.171 --> 12:18.607
You're no animatronic.

12:21.436 --> 12:22.785
- Okay, Mickey, I get that

12:22.829 --> 12:24.569
Lita's pregnancy's unexpected,
you know?

12:24.613 --> 12:26.310
It feels like only yesterday
that we were watching her

12:26.354 --> 12:28.095
grow up,
but if I have learned anything

12:28.138 --> 12:29.618
co-captaining the team
on this ship,

12:29.661 --> 12:31.751
it's that being a parent
is really just about

12:31.794 --> 12:33.883
being cool when things
aren't really that cool, yeah?

12:33.927 --> 12:35.406
Okay, where are we at
with listening, Mick?

12:35.450 --> 12:36.973
-
- Captain Sharpe.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.888
You want another try at
a sassy send-off attempt

12:38.932 --> 12:40.107
for the record?
- No!

12:40.150 --> 12:41.761
- Ooh, why are we power walking?

12:44.502 --> 12:46.896
- Oh, look, she's studying.

12:46.940 --> 12:49.072
It's excellent, right?

12:50.160 --> 12:52.380
Hmm.
Hi, Lita, honey.

12:52.423 --> 12:54.599
See, she's still in school.
That's great, right, Mick?

12:54.643 --> 12:56.471
- Yeah, I have a big test
coming up

12:56.514 --> 12:59.387
in my intersectionality
and feminist activism class.

12:59.430 --> 13:02.259
It's where I met Niko.
-

13:02.303 --> 13:06.394
- You got knocked up by some
creep taking a class for women?

13:06.437 --> 13:08.091
- Let's see what else
you've missed.

13:08.135 --> 13:10.877
I'm vegan.
I'm over my Sabbath phase.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.704
I'm more into Fiona Apple.

13:12.748 --> 13:14.750
And I'm donating all the money
you left me in the shed

13:14.794 --> 13:16.665
to AOC's future
presidential run.

13:16.708 --> 13:18.275
- Wow.

13:18.319 --> 13:20.538
- Is there anything else
you wanna judge me for?

13:20.582 --> 13:22.584
- You know what?
Why don't you tell us

13:22.627 --> 13:24.978
how you and Niko
plan to raise the baby?

13:25.021 --> 13:27.850
- We're cohabitating.

13:27.894 --> 13:32.246
The institution of marriage
is too inherently patriarchal.

13:39.209 --> 13:41.908
Oh,
stupid swollen fingers.

13:41.951 --> 13:44.824
- Here.
- No, I got it.

13:45.520 --> 13:49.089
- You know, uh, Gideon
could have made you something.

13:49.132 --> 13:51.047
- Yeah, well, I don't have
Gideon at school

13:51.091 --> 13:53.789
just to make my life easier.

13:53.833 --> 13:57.749
And usually Niko helps me
with this stuff.

14:00.491 --> 14:04.539
Okay.
I am rational enough

14:04.582 --> 14:09.152
to accept defeat, hangry
enough to accept your help.

14:09.196 --> 14:15.158
- You know, uh, some jars are
like old, stubborn bastards.

14:15.202 --> 14:17.813
They, uh, eventually open up.

14:24.254 --> 14:27.518
Tell me about Niko.

14:32.393 --> 14:34.612
- Ugh.
Would it have killed Kamran

14:34.656 --> 14:37.833
to lock his office door so
the baby alien didn't escape?

14:37.877 --> 14:41.576
- I can't believe you cut my
sexy Totem time short for this.

14:41.619 --> 14:44.144
Oh, by the way.
She'd kill me if I forgot,

14:44.187 --> 14:45.275
she said, "Hey."

14:45.319 --> 14:47.408
- Hm.
That's sweet.

14:47.451 --> 14:49.410
Hey, girl.

14:49.453 --> 14:53.240
What does she do in the Totem,
for, like, you know, self-care?

14:53.283 --> 14:54.937
- Mostly be at peace.

14:54.981 --> 14:56.460
School the ancestors in poker,

14:56.504 --> 14:58.506
but mainly she wanted
to talk about B.

14:59.289 --> 15:01.074
- Really?
- Yeah.

15:01.117 --> 15:02.510
She wanted to know his current
hair length, is he dating,

15:02.553 --> 15:04.512
did he beat any
of her high scores?

15:04.555 --> 15:06.253
And for whatever reason,
she asked me

15:06.296 --> 15:07.907
to keep an eye on him tonight
to make sure he didn't

15:07.950 --> 15:10.822
party too hard--
Oh!

15:10.866 --> 15:12.650
I just got it.
- Of course,

15:12.694 --> 15:14.739
even though she's stuck
in mystical limbo,

15:14.783 --> 15:16.828
she didn't forget his birthday.

15:21.442 --> 15:23.052
- There.
You happy?

15:23.096 --> 15:25.228
- Yeah.
Maybe one with the both of us?

15:25.272 --> 15:27.404
I could snap it.
Long arms.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.885
- Behrad.
Let's go.

15:31.104 --> 15:32.496
- You know,
by catching this alien,

15:32.540 --> 15:34.107
we're actually
preventing capitalism

15:34.150 --> 15:35.978

15:36.022 --> 15:37.849
- Yeah.
A monster hit.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.547

15:39.590 --> 15:41.418
Don't tell me you think
the baby alien's cute too.

15:41.462 --> 15:42.898
-
No, I don't think it's cute,

15:42.942 --> 15:45.205
but there is no accounting
mass taste.

15:45.248 --> 15:46.989

the biggest mission ever.

15:49.078 --> 15:51.124

19:39.352 --> 19:41.919

to their parents

19:41.963 --> 19:43.617
during the, uh,
developmental phase.

19:43.660 --> 19:47.795
So if, uh, Gus-Gus

19:47.838 --> 19:49.318
you'll have to get him

20:39.281 --> 20:40.761
-
- He--

20:40.804 --> 20:43.590
It's obviously me,
I'm the trained actor.

20:43.633 --> 20:45.896
I mean, it's gonna be a nosy,
glamorous landlord, but

20:45.940 --> 20:47.637
Nate, come with, run lines?

20:47.681 --> 20:49.465
- All right, let's get you ready
for that closeup.

20:49.509 --> 20:51.598
- Okay, great.
Zari, once you book the part,

20:51.641 --> 20:53.643
you'll be in position
to separate Gus-Gus

20:53.687 --> 20:55.689
from Imran's brother
and bond with him.

20:55.732 --> 20:57.430
Astra and B,
make sure that

20:57.473 --> 20:59.214
this new script
doesn't make it to air.

20:59.258 --> 21:01.260
We have to ensure
that Imran stays the star

21:01.303 --> 21:03.740
so that Behrad can stay himself.

21:10.573 --> 21:12.836
- What do you mean
I'm not a right fit for the r--

21:12.880 --> 21:15.099
You don't seem
super great at your job.

21:15.143 --> 21:17.232
- The writers had a very
specific vision in mind.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.365
Someone who fits
the new direction of the show.

21:19.408 --> 21:21.149
- Oh, did they?
- Hey, Z.

21:21.192 --> 21:23.630
The sign by the complimentary
mints said only take one,

21:23.673 --> 21:25.806
so, uh, keep this on the DL.

21:28.330 --> 21:30.767
Nathaniel Heywood.
No need to lie about my height,

21:30.811 --> 21:32.987
I am 6 foot...

21:33.030 --> 21:34.423
2.

21:34.467 --> 21:37.426
Uh, currently living?
Here and there.

21:37.470 --> 21:39.472
I travel a lot for work.

21:39.515 --> 21:41.125
Is this for the CW?

21:41.561 --> 21:43.258
<i>- Well, so much for plan Z.</i>

21:43.302 --> 21:45.173
But Nate's getting
his big break.

21:45.216 --> 21:48.263
Finally,
a win for straight, white men.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.483
- Well, if I was rebooting
a show with a flop first season,

21:50.526 --> 21:52.963
you'd be my pick.

21:53.007 --> 21:55.270
Who says stuff like that?

21:55.314 --> 21:57.185
I don't wanna become
some materialistic jerk

21:57.228 --> 21:59.840
with a Roth IRA,
driving a car that burns gas,

21:59.883 --> 22:01.842
and pounding Red Eyes!

22:01.885 --> 22:03.670
- If this show
is going off the rails,

22:03.713 --> 22:05.062
you need to talk to the person

22:05.106 --> 22:07.413
at the top of the food chain.

22:12.809 --> 22:14.550
- "Faiz,
it's the nosy landlord.

22:14.594 --> 22:16.378
"Hide all the bongs.

22:16.422 --> 22:19.076
<i>And</i> the baby alien."

22:22.384 --> 22:23.951
As your boss,
I gotta tell you,

22:23.994 --> 22:25.866
I'm good
on the pharmaceuticals, bro.

22:25.909 --> 22:27.215
At least until
this makeup sets.

22:27.258 --> 22:29.652
- You can't sell out, man!

22:31.915 --> 22:33.787
Growing up,
my mom and dad looked at me

22:33.830 --> 22:36.311
and saw a future
business school graduate.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.008
The world saw a weird,
Muslim kid

22:38.052 --> 22:40.446
they couldn't bother
to figure out.

22:40.489 --> 22:42.970
But seeing you on TV, Imran,

22:43.013 --> 22:46.190
was the first time <i>I</i> saw me.

22:48.628 --> 22:50.934
- That's great.

22:50.978 --> 22:53.241
But I gotta do
what my brother tells me.

22:53.284 --> 22:55.112
- No, you don't.

22:55.156 --> 22:58.942
Dude,
I flipped burgers, spun signs,

22:58.986 --> 23:00.988
but the gig I have now,

23:01.031 --> 23:03.904
it's the sweetest gig ever.

23:05.558 --> 23:08.299
Just had to let you know,
I wouldn't have ended up here

23:08.343 --> 23:11.477
if I hadn't seen you
on "Bud Stuy" so carefree.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.436
It's like you gave me
permission to leave home

23:14.480 --> 23:18.614
and go on the craziest
adventure of my life.

23:18.658 --> 23:21.356
Please,
don't change your show.

23:21.400 --> 23:24.403
It's perfect the way it is.

23:25.882 --> 23:28.450
- You must really love
being a PA.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.583
Like a lot.

23:40.897 --> 23:43.030
- Oh, come on.

23:47.948 --> 23:51.081
- Imran, the studio loves
the baby alien in the new draft.

23:51.125 --> 23:53.040
And you're gonna love the
casting for the nosy landlord.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.302
- Kam, this isn't working out.

23:54.345 --> 23:56.870
- I promise,
the new guy pops.

24:11.580 --> 24:14.235
You really not believe
in that anymore?

24:14.278 --> 24:16.498
- What about the people
who pay us to make a hit?

24:16.542 --> 24:18.631
The studio's threatening
to cancel us.

24:26.943 --> 24:29.598
- Yeah, well, I'd rather
have one person laughing

24:29.642 --> 24:31.992
in the audience
than be a complete sellout.

24:32.035 --> 24:33.254

the meeting with Kamran?

- It's gonna be all right.

31:22.402 --> 31:23.794
- Is it?

31:23.838 --> 31:24.970
At least when your Zari
lost Behrad,

31:25.013 --> 31:26.406
it wasn't her fault.

31:26.449 --> 31:28.408
- Enough with the
"your Zari" stuff.

31:28.451 --> 31:29.931
You're my Zari too.
- No, Nate.

31:29.975 --> 31:31.541
Your Zari is gone,
and without the Totem,

31:31.585 --> 31:33.282
so is everything
she sacrificed her life for.

31:33.326 --> 31:34.893
A decision I doubt
she would have made if she knew

31:34.936 --> 31:36.851
she was being replaced
by a version of her who--

31:36.895 --> 31:38.548
Who didn't realize how

31:38.592 --> 31:41.290
a sitcom <i>literally
changed her brother's life.</i>

31:41.334 --> 31:43.771
- Z, we all messed up,
but we gotta get moving.

31:43.814 --> 31:45.555
When this timeline
catches up to Behrad,

31:45.599 --> 31:49.081
there's no telling
who we're gonna be without him.

31:52.780 --> 31:55.000
- So, when were you gonna
tell me about Kayla?

31:55.043 --> 31:56.697
Sounds like you really
cared about her.

31:56.740 --> 31:59.047
- And do not
leave out any details.

31:59.091 --> 32:01.963
Like, uh, when you
got caught up in the moment--

32:02.007 --> 32:02.964
cover your ears, Lita--

32:03.008 --> 32:05.358
were there any, uh...

32:05.401 --> 32:07.838
tentacles involved?

32:07.882 --> 32:09.449
- Whoa!

32:09.492 --> 32:11.842
You dated an alien?

32:11.886 --> 32:12.974
- We didn't date.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.020
We, uh, we almost died.

32:15.063 --> 32:18.414
But then we, uh,
then I--

32:18.458 --> 32:19.850
- Gross, dad.

32:19.894 --> 32:21.635
- So there were
tentacles involved?

32:21.678 --> 32:23.593
- Yeah.
Lots. It was mind-blowing.

32:23.637 --> 32:25.682

Now, get out of here!

32:25.726 --> 32:28.772

32:30.644 --> 32:32.167

32:32.211 --> 32:34.256
- Ugh.
Now what?

32:34.300 --> 32:36.824
- Listen, I know you worked
your ass off for this moment.

32:36.867 --> 32:40.219
And our hard work
is rarely celebrated.

32:40.262 --> 32:43.744
So I get how badly
you wanna be seen, but...

32:43.787 --> 32:45.311

32:45.354 --> 32:47.139
- Have you ever seen the show?

32:47.182 --> 32:48.836
My brother wasn't exactly
making television

32:48.879 --> 32:51.012
that we could be proud of.

32:51.056 --> 32:52.753
- Well, you know what,

32:52.796 --> 32:54.581
he doesn't have to be
a torch-bearer for all of us.

32:54.624 --> 32:56.191
That expectation is, honestly,

32:56.235 --> 32:58.672
unrealistic and, frankly, annoying.

32:58.715 --> 33:00.369
Your brother inspired people,

33:00.413 --> 33:03.329
not by trying
to inspire people, but...

33:03.372 --> 33:05.374
just by being himself.

33:05.418 --> 33:08.551
- Well then
too bad that he quit.
