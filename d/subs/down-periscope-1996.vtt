WEBVTT

01:03.800 --> 01:09.471
Moving on to the last name on the list,
Lt Cmdr Thomas Dodge.

01:09.556 --> 01:14.383
Third in his class at sub school.
Did even better in the advanced course.

01:14.478 --> 01:18.557
Cited for tactical excellence,
joint NATO exercise.

01:23.696 --> 01:25.938
180 and closing, sir.

01:26.031 --> 01:31.618
- Ahead one-third, steady on course.
- Ahead one-third, steady on course. Aye, sir.

01:31.705 --> 01:36.117
- Target at 175 and closing, sir.
- Let's try a shot.

01:36.209 --> 01:40.160
This is the third time
Tom Dodge has come up for command.

01:40.256 --> 01:43.955
If we don't give him a boat, he'll be
dropped from the command programme,

01:44.050 --> 01:46.008
which would be a tragedy for him

01:46.094 --> 01:50.673
and a mistake for us, given the years
and dollars spent training him.

01:50.766 --> 01:53.851
Well, I'd have to disagree with you,
Admiral Price.

01:53.936 --> 01:57.720
Dodge's fitness report
also presents a man who three years ago

01:57.815 --> 02:01.766
brushed against a Russian
missile sub just off Murmansk.

02:01.862 --> 02:04.399
Not exactly a promotional bell-ringer.

02:04.489 --> 02:08.238
Target at 160, sir. Five-knot aiding wind.

02:09.119 --> 02:12.570
- Delivery seven.
- We have a shooting solution.

02:12.664 --> 02:17.872
More to the point, I simply don't
approve of his command style.

02:17.961 --> 02:21.580
He's impulsive. He's often undisciplined,
even reckless at times.

02:21.674 --> 02:23.750
Fire one!

02:25.928 --> 02:29.463
Get up there, you miserable little puke.

02:33.937 --> 02:36.509
It's a fine shot, sir.

02:36.857 --> 02:41.269
Well, what the heck?
Why don't we pull in so you can putt out?

02:46.491 --> 02:51.783
I will simply remind the selection board
of one irrefutable fact

02:51.872 --> 02:54.624
that seems to sum up Dodge's character.

02:54.709 --> 03:00.462
There is physical evidence that as an ensign
Dodge became so physically intoxicated

03:00.549 --> 03:04.925
that he not only allowed
himself to be tattooed,

03:05.011 --> 03:07.847
but tattooed on his genitalia.

03:09.224 --> 03:13.933
Now, call me a prude if you want, but I
don't think it's good policy for the navy

03:14.020 --> 03:17.555
to hand over a billion-dollar
piece of equipment

03:17.649 --> 03:22.358
to a man who has "Welcome Aboard"
tattooed on his penis.

03:38.505 --> 03:42.371
After 80 days under the ice pack I thought
some recreation might be in order.

03:42.467 --> 03:46.085
- Priority message, sir.
- I was not endangering the boat.

03:46.180 --> 03:51.387
Your actions were totally inappropriate.
It's not the way a prospective captain acts.

03:51.477 --> 03:54.146
A failing noted more than
once in your fit rep.

03:54.230 --> 03:59.390
As much as I like to see my men advance, I
have an obligation to be as honest as I can.

03:59.484 --> 04:04.195
- Then I'm in trouble.
- This is entirely of your own making.

04:05.992 --> 04:10.404
This is a confirmed kill.
20 years down the fucking drain.

04:10.496 --> 04:14.115
Watch your language, Dodge.
You know how I hate that.

04:14.209 --> 04:18.421
Gee, now I've gone and done it.
Ruined my career!

04:19.841 --> 04:22.461
Apparently not.

04:25.304 --> 04:28.056
This is just in from COMSUBLANT.

04:28.141 --> 04:31.972
You are to report to Norfolk immediately.

04:32.061 --> 04:34.932
- To command your own submarine.
- That's not funny.

04:35.022 --> 04:39.067
No, it's not.
That's why they decoded it twice.

04:48.829 --> 04:51.320
Congratulations.

05:09.643 --> 05:12.051
?Oh, yeah!

05:12.144 --> 05:16.357
I just hope they have one in turquoise.
Thank you!

05:19.444 --> 05:22.896
It's good to see you again, Dodge.
Been about four years.

05:22.990 --> 05:26.572
Something like that, sir.
Not since we were both at Kings Bay.

05:26.661 --> 05:32.081
Well, you're about to join
the elite of the submarine service.

05:32.166 --> 05:36.413
- The best the United States Navy has to offer.
- Damn good feeling, sir.

05:36.504 --> 05:40.668
As a matter of fact,
there she is right now.

05:42.218 --> 05:44.709
Your new boat.

05:48.391 --> 05:53.137
<i>USS Stingray. SS 161.</i>

05:53.814 --> 05:55.771
That?

05:55.858 --> 06:00.105
- This can't be my boat, sir.
- Well, it most certainly is.

06:00.196 --> 06:06.531
- Balao class, refitted 1958.
- Balao class? But that's a diesel sub.

06:06.619 --> 06:11.744
- The navy doesn't even use diesels any more.
- They do now. She's been recommissioned.

06:11.833 --> 06:16.495
<i>No disrespect to the USS Rustoleum here,
but I'd be better off in the Merrimack.</i>

06:16.587 --> 06:21.499
- I was trained to command a nuclear boat.
- Are you refusing to take command?

06:23.761 --> 06:26.431
- No, sir.
- Good.

06:26.515 --> 06:31.593
- Meet your crew here tomorrow at 0700.
- They also left over from World War Two, sir?

06:31.688 --> 06:33.726
No, Captain.

06:33.815 --> 06:38.275
They've been handpicked... by me.

06:41.114 --> 06:42.572
Come on in.

06:42.658 --> 06:46.156
Thank you for seeing me
on such short notice, Admiral Winslow.

06:46.245 --> 06:48.652
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

06:50.124 --> 06:54.750
- Well, how do you like your boat?
- It's a complete piece of...

06:56.755 --> 06:59.425
antiquated equipment, sir.

06:59.508 --> 07:03.588
I have dedicated a substantial portion
of my life to getting my own boat.

07:03.679 --> 07:06.349
I was wondering why
you chose to embarrass me.

07:06.432 --> 07:11.178
No embarrassment intended.
You've been chosen for a specific mission.

07:11.271 --> 07:15.351
To turn her into a museum, sir?
The Wonderful World Of Corrosion?

07:15.442 --> 07:17.351
Hardly.

07:17.444 --> 07:23.031
Here are recent satellite photos of Russian
bases at Petropavlovsk and Vladivostok.

07:23.117 --> 07:27.066
That's where the Russians
have got their diesel sub fleet.

07:27.161 --> 07:31.991
But each week they're fewer because
they're selling them off like hot cakes

07:32.084 --> 07:35.288
to countries like Iran,
Iraq and Libya, to name a few.

07:35.380 --> 07:40.338
With respect, sir, one American nuclear
attack sub could defeat several diesels.

07:40.426 --> 07:43.214
In conventional battle,
certainly that's true.

07:43.304 --> 07:49.474
What if you had one renegade diesel captain
who decided to hit us without warning,

07:49.561 --> 07:53.261
a terrorist intent on getting
a nuclear warhead into a harbour?

07:53.356 --> 07:57.021
Do you think we could catch and kill
a bogie like that in time?

07:57.111 --> 07:59.234
Absolutely, sir.

07:59.321 --> 08:03.486
Well, most of the admiralty,
they would agree with you.

08:03.575 --> 08:06.530
But me, personally, I'd
like to know for sure.

08:06.620 --> 08:11.117
<i>That's why you'll clean up the Stingray
and take her out off the Atlantic coast</i>

08:11.209 --> 08:13.665
for a series of war games.

08:13.753 --> 08:18.214
One rebel diesel against
the US nuclear navy.

08:18.299 --> 08:20.376
Come on.

08:23.305 --> 08:26.389
First you'll attempt to invade
Charleston harbour.

08:26.475 --> 08:29.262
If you're good enough
to evade further pursuit,

08:29.353 --> 08:33.979
you're going to attempt to sink shipping
right here at the naval base in Norfolk.

08:34.066 --> 08:36.105
Simulated, of course.

08:36.193 --> 08:39.610
- What do you think?
- I think I'm gonna get my ass kicked, sir.

08:39.697 --> 08:43.363
Don't think like that.
Damn it to hell, don't go by the book.

08:43.450 --> 08:48.446
Think like a pirate.
I want a man with a tattoo on his dick.

08:48.540 --> 08:51.031
Have I got the right man?

08:52.001 --> 08:54.209
By a strange coincidence you do, sir.

08:54.295 --> 09:00.631
However, the task you've given me here
is close to impossible.

09:01.512 --> 09:05.806
If I pull it off, that is get both ports...

09:07.184 --> 09:09.641
I would like command of
my own nuclear sub.

09:09.728 --> 09:12.399
- Setting terms now?
- No, sir.

09:12.481 --> 09:16.811
But without command, once this exercise
is over I'm headed for a deskjob,

09:16.903 --> 09:18.979
which means I'm out of the navy.

09:19.072 --> 09:24.827
I can't make you any guarantees, Dodge,
but this is what I'll do.

09:24.911 --> 09:29.870
I'll give you two live torpedoes.
I'll set a dummy ship in Norfolk harbour.

09:29.958 --> 09:33.292
If I see that baby go up,
then we'll talk about your boat.

09:33.629 --> 09:35.123
Thank you, sir.

09:46.351 --> 09:49.267
Nice pants. Lose the cigar.

09:49.354 --> 09:51.928
You better burn that shirt, sailor.

09:52.023 --> 09:54.515
It's the crew from hell.

09:55.777 --> 10:00.154
<i>Good morning, sir! Martin G Pascal,
Executive Officer of the Stingray, sir!</i>

10:00.241 --> 10:02.862
- Do you come with a volume control?
- Sir?

10:02.952 --> 10:05.158
Lt Commander Tom Dodge.

10:05.246 --> 10:09.409
- You're kind of young for an XO.
- Excellence knows no age, sir.

10:09.500 --> 10:11.658
What do you think about our boat?

10:11.752 --> 10:14.373
I need a tetanus shotjust
from looking at it.

10:14.463 --> 10:18.462
The only thing holding her together
are the bird droppings, sir.

10:18.552 --> 10:23.463
We have our crew here, I see.
What do you say we board them?

10:23.556 --> 10:27.506
Yes, sir. Seaman Stanley Sylvesterson, sir!

10:29.145 --> 10:32.479
- Welcome aboard, Sylves-terson.
- Sylvesterson, sir.

10:32.566 --> 10:36.398
- Though my friends call me Spots.
- Spots.

10:37.654 --> 10:40.691
I'm a bit of a gambler, sir.

10:41.410 --> 10:43.532
What happened to your shoes?

10:43.619 --> 10:46.704
Ever bet on a sure thing
and the horse gets a cramp, sir?

10:46.789 --> 10:48.829
- Grab a bunk.
- Thank you, sir.

10:50.835 --> 10:54.750
- Next.
- Hey, get your hands off of me!

10:56.800 --> 10:59.966
Oh, good. Our chaplain has arrived.

11:01.722 --> 11:05.801
Sonar Technician, Second Class,
ET Lovacelli, sir!

11:06.851 --> 11:10.601
- Goes under the name "Sonar".
- Welcome aboard, Sonar.

11:10.690 --> 11:16.195
Excuse me, sir.
This is an actual navy submarine?

11:16.278 --> 11:20.657
- Not a float in a parade or something?
- I'm afraid so, Sonar.

11:22.743 --> 11:24.653
Isn't that odd.

11:24.745 --> 11:27.415
Don't tell me. Deaf as Beethoven.

11:27.499 --> 11:31.247
Oh, no. Great ears, sir.
Watch what you say around him.

11:31.336 --> 11:35.086
He hears everything. His last CO
thought he was a security problem.

11:35.173 --> 11:41.793
Excuse me, sir, I don't hear everything.
And I'm quite trustworthy too.

11:42.974 --> 11:45.050
Right.

11:48.271 --> 11:50.097
Shoot.

11:50.189 --> 11:54.187
Engine Man, First Class, Brad Stepanak!

11:56.279 --> 11:58.355
Sit on it and rotate, sir.

11:58.448 --> 12:01.900
What did you say, sailor?
You can't say that.

12:01.994 --> 12:06.157
- He can't say that!
- Pascal, down. Heel.

12:06.248 --> 12:10.661
By the code of military justice,
that constitutes gross insubordination,

12:10.753 --> 12:14.751
punishable by one month in the brig.
I'm ready to go, sir.

12:14.840 --> 12:19.633
- Board the boat. I like a challenge.
- You'll throw me off within a week.

12:19.720 --> 12:21.963
I'm a dedicated pain in the butt, sir.

12:22.057 --> 12:24.133
- Stepanak.
- What?

12:25.477 --> 12:30.353
If I throw you off,
it'll be in the middle of the Atlantic.

12:31.023 --> 12:35.188
- Board the damn boat.
- Oh, man.

12:35.278 --> 12:37.769
What's our mission, rescue Gilligan?

12:37.864 --> 12:40.024
- You're mine, maggot!
- Ha!

12:40.118 --> 12:42.787
I love this job.

12:42.869 --> 12:45.111
And who's our next contestant?

12:48.668 --> 12:52.085
Sorry. The name's Buckman.

12:52.171 --> 12:54.709
- Nitro, hi.
- Interesting nickname.

12:54.800 --> 12:56.839
What's your real name?

12:56.926 --> 12:58.919
Nitro.

12:59.012 --> 13:01.882
- I'm working on a nickname, though.
- Oh, yeah?

13:01.973 --> 13:04.347
Listen to this.

13:04.434 --> 13:06.094
Mike.

13:10.607 --> 13:13.941
- You're Stoneball Jackson.
- Who you calling Stoneball?

13:14.028 --> 13:16.780
I lost a grand on that
army game, butterfingers.

13:16.864 --> 13:20.909
For your information, I was mugged.
Gaines was all over me that play.

13:20.994 --> 13:23.152
I saw that play. I saw the replay.

13:23.246 --> 13:27.659
There was nobody near you but the mascot,
and he could have made that lay-up.

13:27.751 --> 13:30.918
That's cute. But it's on now.

13:48.606 --> 13:52.473
Small, but... filthy.

13:56.864 --> 13:59.072
Come in.

14:00.202 --> 14:02.823
Hell of a day, huh, Marty?

14:02.912 --> 14:07.622
It's not over yet, sir. Lt Lake is here.

14:07.709 --> 14:11.625
- Show him a bunk.
- There's a problem, sir.

14:12.382 --> 14:16.331
Lt Lake reporting for duty, sir.
And there's no problem.

14:19.472 --> 14:22.259
I get it. Please, don't
take off your clothes.

14:22.350 --> 14:26.679
It's nice of the guys to get me a stripper,
but I got a lot of work to do.

14:26.771 --> 14:30.555
Thank you.
Nice job on that uniform though.

14:31.401 --> 14:34.438
I am not a stripper, sir.

14:34.529 --> 14:38.907
I am Lt Emily Lake,
your new dive officer.

14:38.992 --> 14:43.820
Well, that's impossible. They must be
confusing you with Emilio Lake.

14:43.914 --> 14:46.831
Women aren't allowed on submarines.

14:46.918 --> 14:51.379
They are now. Admiral Graham
instituted a trial programme.

14:51.464 --> 14:53.955
- I'm it.
- Good old Graham.

14:56.010 --> 14:58.632
Men! At ease.

14:58.721 --> 15:03.598
I'd like to introduce our newest
crew member - Lt Emily Lake.

15:03.684 --> 15:06.603
Emily is part of a pilot programme

15:06.688 --> 15:11.896
to test the feasibility of women
serving on submarines.

15:11.985 --> 15:14.145
She's going to be our diving officer.

15:14.238 --> 15:18.650
Can she do a back inward
one-and-a-half in the layout position?

15:21.912 --> 15:26.041
Look, gentlemen,
I know this is an unusual situation.

15:26.125 --> 15:29.541
It can't be easy for Lt Lake here
to be thrown into this jungle.

15:29.629 --> 15:32.915
And I know it will make
things hard on all of us.

15:35.343 --> 15:41.429
Let me rephrase that. It's going to
make things difficult on all of us as well.

15:41.516 --> 15:46.808
But if we just work together as a team,
I'm sure we can handle ourselves...

15:48.649 --> 15:51.223
Ping!

15:51.319 --> 15:54.273
Comport ourselves as professionals.

15:55.531 --> 15:57.608
That is all.

16:19.681 --> 16:22.470
Come on, put some muscle into it.

16:27.398 --> 16:30.898
- Stepanak, what are you doing?
- As little as possible, sir.

16:31.736 --> 16:36.030
I'm a detriment to the entire operation.
A total morale-crusher.

16:36.115 --> 16:40.160
You know that the submarine service
is entirely volunteer.

16:40.246 --> 16:44.112
- All you have to do is quit.
- My old man won't let me.

16:44.207 --> 16:47.790
He's an admiral.
He thinks sub duty will shake me up.

16:47.878 --> 16:49.456
Ha!

16:49.546 --> 16:52.963
I'm afraid you leave me no choice
but to relocate you.

16:53.050 --> 16:55.458
- Really?
- Really.

16:55.553 --> 16:57.711
- Buckman.
- Yes, sir?

17:00.016 --> 17:03.136
Thank you, Buckman. That'll be all.

17:04.771 --> 17:07.441
1B, cold.

17:07.523 --> 17:09.599
1C...

17:11.862 --> 17:14.151
Hot.

17:15.698 --> 17:19.233
Let me guess. Our electrician.

17:19.328 --> 17:21.534
- 2B...
- Yes, sir.

17:27.337 --> 17:31.631
- Naturally you would take the light end.
- You can't handle it, sweetheart?

17:31.715 --> 17:35.963
Hey, this is the navy.
Don't call me sweetheart.

17:36.054 --> 17:40.717
- Hey, Gomer, can you get this hatch for us?
- This week.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.978
Aaargh!

17:50.777 --> 17:52.106
Uh-oh.

17:59.371 --> 18:01.659
Buckman!

18:02.832 --> 18:06.996
- What the hell are you doing?
- Stocking the pantry, sir.

18:07.087 --> 18:11.998
You forgot "like an idiot", because
you're stocking the pantry like an idiot.

18:12.551 --> 18:15.718
What are in these cans, Buckman?

18:15.804 --> 18:19.553
That one's coffee.
That one looks like cooking lard, sir.

18:19.642 --> 18:22.807
And which do you think
we're going to be using more often?

18:22.895 --> 18:25.053
The coffee or the lard?

18:26.858 --> 18:32.646
You think we're all going to jump out of bed
and have a big hot steaming cup of pig fat?

18:32.739 --> 18:35.444
Well, if it's a cold
morning, sir, you might...

18:35.533 --> 18:40.279
The lard is in your head, Buckman!

18:40.372 --> 18:42.946
Now you take a look at that galley chart.

18:43.042 --> 18:47.252
Cos I want that cabinet repacked
regulation-style by 1100.

18:47.338 --> 18:50.836
- Do you know what time 1100 is?
- That would be after 1000, sir.

18:50.925 --> 18:53.332
- Marty.
- What?!

18:53.427 --> 18:55.503
Sir?

18:56.263 --> 18:59.182
Can we speak in my cabin?

19:00.309 --> 19:02.385
Carry on.

19:04.856 --> 19:11.143
Marty, I'm a little worried about your health.
Not exactly a people person, are you?

19:11.238 --> 19:16.315
I'm afraid you're headed straight for an
ulcer if you can't ease up a little bit.

19:16.410 --> 19:20.573
I'm not happy with this boat, sir.

19:21.248 --> 19:25.163
Requesting permission for a transfer.

19:25.252 --> 19:27.079
What?

19:27.171 --> 19:30.504
Commander, this boat is...

19:30.591 --> 19:32.917
It's a rustbucket. It's a shitbox!

19:33.011 --> 19:39.548
This crew is the most incompetent bunch
of retards and assholes in naval history.

19:39.643 --> 19:44.601
I know why you're here, but I don't know why
I was considered for such an assignment.

19:44.689 --> 19:48.105
Excuse me. Why am I here?

19:49.028 --> 19:51.780
You know.

19:52.448 --> 19:55.069
- Your thing.
- What thing?

19:57.828 --> 20:00.865
The weenie tattoo.

20:00.956 --> 20:02.783
Wow!

20:02.875 --> 20:08.879
Look, I hate to disappoint you, but I may
have had some other things going for me.

20:08.965 --> 20:11.253
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I believe you, sir.

20:11.884 --> 20:16.630
Now, about my transfer. This post could
jeopardise my chances for advancement.

20:16.723 --> 20:20.768
- I mean, I am this close to command, sir.
- Forget it.

20:20.852 --> 20:25.396
You think you're the only one embarrassed
to be here? That it's what I dreamed about.

20:25.482 --> 20:31.936
We're all in this together, and you and your
career are in the hands of those assholes.

20:32.031 --> 20:35.482
Including this one.
Does that answer your question?

20:35.576 --> 20:38.780
- Yes, sir.
- Dismissed.

20:49.758 --> 20:51.834
<i>Go, boys!</i>

20:54.971 --> 20:57.297
Jesus Christ.

21:02.021 --> 21:04.938
<i>You sure her clothes are in there?</i>

21:05.608 --> 21:08.444
Uh, unless this is yours.

21:18.705 --> 21:20.912
Well done, guys.

21:20.999 --> 21:26.042
She may not be the youngest girl at the
ball, but she'll turn a head or two.

21:26.129 --> 21:29.795
If she drives as well as she looks,
we may even survive.

21:29.883 --> 21:34.462
Dive test tomorrow morning 1000.
The rest of you are on leave until...

21:49.070 --> 21:51.443
Lt Lake,

21:51.531 --> 21:53.405
you're almost out of uniform.

21:53.992 --> 21:58.204
Either you're confused about your
dress size or there's been foul play.

21:58.289 --> 22:03.247
If it's a disqualifying offence I'd like
to take full and sole responsibility, sir.

22:03.336 --> 22:08.578
Gentlemen, I want to know who did this
or shore leave is cancelled tonight.

22:11.011 --> 22:14.461
Very well. Everybody back into the boat.

22:15.556 --> 22:18.558
You heard the captain. Back on the boat!

22:27.569 --> 22:29.645
Lt Lake.

22:30.615 --> 22:33.283
Sorry. It won't happen again.

22:33.368 --> 22:36.487
Thank you, sir.
But I can take care of myself.

22:55.098 --> 22:58.799
All right, gentlemen. Let's kick this pig!

23:00.396 --> 23:02.934
All lines clear.

23:46.028 --> 23:49.277
- Get the lookouts below and button her up.
- Aye, sir.

23:49.365 --> 23:53.196
- Prepare to rig for dive!
- Aye, rig for dive.

23:53.284 --> 23:56.452
Watch your drift here.
Strong crosscurrents.

23:56.538 --> 24:00.370
- I'm aware of that, sir. I've compensated.
- Excellent.

24:00.459 --> 24:04.955
So, you ever dived a
boat before, Lieutenant?

24:05.422 --> 24:08.423
I mean on purpose?

24:08.509 --> 24:13.255
I've done over 300 on a simulator, sir.
75 of them were strong-current dives.

24:13.347 --> 24:17.926
- And I'm sure you scored high, but...
- Higher than you, sir.

24:18.019 --> 24:20.427
Oh. How would you know that?

24:20.522 --> 24:25.765
- I looked up your scores. I have a printout.
- I have no doubt.

24:25.861 --> 24:29.277
Still, a simulator is not a boat.

24:29.364 --> 24:32.816
Nobody talks about brave men
in their proud simulators.

24:32.910 --> 24:36.196
<i>Way to go, sir.</i>

24:36.289 --> 24:39.539
All right, gentlemen. Let's take her down.

24:39.626 --> 24:44.085
<i>- Prepare for dive!
- Aye! Prepare for dive.</i>

24:47.967 --> 24:49.296
Uh...

24:49.385 --> 24:51.960
Does he mean underwater?

24:54.892 --> 24:56.968
What...

25:02.566 --> 25:05.686
Dive, dive. Rig for deep submergence.

25:05.778 --> 25:08.862
- Make your depth 6-2 feet.
- 6-2, aye.

25:08.947 --> 25:11.236
Seven, down 6-2.

25:11.325 --> 25:16.035
Full ahead two-thirds.
Blow negative to the mark.

25:24.547 --> 25:27.252
OK, boys. Down we go.

25:59.250 --> 26:01.326
Oh, my God.

26:02.253 --> 26:04.924
<i>- What the hell did you do?
- What the hell did you do?</i>

26:05.007 --> 26:07.332
We're dead. Five to one says we're dead.

26:07.426 --> 26:12.384
- Cool. Did we hit an iceberg?
- Off the coast of Virginia?

26:12.474 --> 26:17.218
- Sir, we have 12 degrees tilt starboard.
- Check all emergency vents open.

26:17.312 --> 26:20.930
- The board indicates all vents are open.
- I can see that.

26:21.023 --> 26:23.479
Captain, maybe we're taking on water.

26:23.568 --> 26:26.818
Mr Pascal, it must be a vent.

26:29.950 --> 26:33.283
<i>Emergency vent two-bravo
appears shut.</i>

26:33.370 --> 26:36.241
<i>- Well, then open it.
- Roger.</i>

26:58.021 --> 26:59.266
What?

27:01.442 --> 27:04.692
That bump looks bad.
You'd better get to sickbay.

27:04.778 --> 27:08.112
I'd rather not, sir.
I want to finish this dive.

27:09.658 --> 27:12.576
Very well. Continue the dive.

27:12.661 --> 27:16.445
Let's take her down to... oh, say 500 feet.

27:17.459 --> 27:19.535
Yes, sir.

27:22.421 --> 27:28.626
Make your depth 5-0-0 feet,
seven degree down bubble.

27:33.016 --> 27:37.180
- This is good coffee, Buckman.
- Thank you, sir.

27:38.730 --> 27:42.811
I'd better go see if any of
the other rooms are still tilted.

27:45.781 --> 27:47.653
This one's all right.

27:50.910 --> 27:56.331
- 1-0-0 feet, ma'am.
- Passing 100 feet.

28:05.050 --> 28:07.837
Now, keep an eye on the string.

28:07.927 --> 28:14.642
Cos the water pressure is going to squeeze the
hull of this boat like an empty beer can.

28:25.489 --> 28:28.573
2-8-0 feet, ma'am.

28:29.951 --> 28:33.320
Passing 280 feet, Captain.

28:33.413 --> 28:36.581
Jackson, adjust trim.

28:39.879 --> 28:42.168
No, it's OK.

28:42.255 --> 28:45.007
Passing 300 feet.

28:51.557 --> 28:54.926
Passing 350 feet, sir.

29:03.111 --> 29:07.608
Bet you never saw anything like that
on one of them big nukes.

29:07.699 --> 29:13.287
We didn't have clotheslines. We had those
dryer things with the window on the front.

29:16.459 --> 29:19.910
<i>- 400 feet. No leaks.</i>

29:20.713 --> 29:24.165
Sir, I believe this is crush depth
for this particular boat.

29:24.259 --> 29:27.628
I have to know what she can do, Lake.
You nervous?

29:28.345 --> 29:31.016
<i>- No, sir.</i>

29:35.145 --> 29:37.518
<i>Maintain seven down.</i>

30:19.567 --> 30:24.276
Bingo! 500 feet. God, I love this job.

30:25.365 --> 30:29.279
All right, that's enough for today.
Let's get the hell out of here.

30:29.369 --> 30:33.948
- Mr Pascal please, periscope depth.
- Periscope depth.

30:34.040 --> 30:39.330
Ladies and gentlemen, let me be the first
to congratulate you on a textbook dive.

30:50.725 --> 30:52.599
<i>Carl, you and the Orlando</i>

30:52.684 --> 30:59.399
are about to take part in a highly experimental
war game conceived by Admiral Winslow.

30:59.483 --> 31:03.613
<i>The objective is for the Orlando
to protect Charleston</i>

31:03.696 --> 31:08.988
against an unknown submarine
that'll try to invade the harbour.

31:09.077 --> 31:13.573
Now, I would love to be
able to tell you more,

31:13.665 --> 31:17.166
but the conditions of the
exercise prohibit it.

31:17.252 --> 31:19.578
However, I can tell you this.

31:19.671 --> 31:23.800
Given the nature of the intruder,
you won't have much trouble.

31:23.884 --> 31:25.960
We'll be more than ready, sir.

31:32.101 --> 31:35.720
?I'm going to feel the way I do today

31:35.814 --> 31:39.100
?Cos you, you nutsy chick, you broad

31:39.192 --> 31:42.560
?You make me feel so young. Boom!

31:42.654 --> 31:45.774
That was terrible.
I'm going to go outside for a smoke.

31:45.866 --> 31:51.490
When I get back in you'd better have the horn
section figured out. I can't work like this.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.080
It's two on and two outs.
Bonds is up again. Swung on.

31:58.171 --> 32:02.583
Foul down the right-field line.
It struck the ball girl. Knocked her cold.

32:02.675 --> 32:07.467
- Today's game is brought to you by...
- Boy's absorbed a lot of voltage.

32:07.556 --> 32:09.298
Conn-sonar.

32:09.390 --> 32:13.768
So far, sir, I'm only picking up
some faint merchant traffic.

32:13.854 --> 32:17.687
- Roger that, Sonar.
- Captain, I'm just wondering.

32:17.774 --> 32:21.275
We're in the engagement zone.
Shouldn't we be running silent?

32:21.361 --> 32:25.110
- Notjust yet.
- They'll find us in no time like this.

32:25.199 --> 32:28.698
They'll probably find us
in no time anyway, Marty.

32:28.786 --> 32:35.121
- Anything unusual up there?
- Just fishing boats. Weather's gotten bad.

32:47.055 --> 32:50.010
The intruder is probably
coming from Norfolk.

32:50.100 --> 32:54.597
Her captain will assume
we'll concentrate our efforts to the north.

32:54.689 --> 32:58.307
But her captain is undoubtedly
a cunning man,

32:58.401 --> 33:02.565
so we shall do the opposite
and deploy southerly.

33:02.655 --> 33:06.072
XO, come to 1-7-6, ahead full.

33:06.159 --> 33:09.859
Aye, sir. Course 1-7-6 ahead full.

33:10.330 --> 33:14.494
- Picking up anything, Sonar?
- Nothing much, sir.

33:14.585 --> 33:18.796
Buckman's eating an Oreo up in the galley.

33:18.881 --> 33:22.131
- Stepanak's taking a leak.
- In the ocean, I mean.

33:22.217 --> 33:23.249
Oh.

33:23.343 --> 33:26.796
No, just a couple of biologics, sir.
Would you like to listen?

33:26.890 --> 33:29.806
No, I'll pass on that, thanks.

33:29.893 --> 33:32.597
What are these tapes you got here?

33:32.686 --> 33:35.260
Those are whales, sir.

33:35.356 --> 33:40.943
I tape them, try to learn their language.
Just basic chitchat and so on.

33:41.030 --> 33:46.368
I do their hailing call against the hull.
Sometimes they actually answer back.

33:46.993 --> 33:51.822
Had a nice young couple alongside
two or three hours ago.

33:51.915 --> 33:57.076
If you hear them talking about the new
nuclear attack sub in town, let me know.

33:57.171 --> 33:59.744
Aye-aye, sir.

34:03.511 --> 34:08.754
Conn-sonar. I've got a noise level
bearing 3-4-6 that may be a contact.

34:08.850 --> 34:11.424
But it's pretty shallow to be a sub.

34:11.520 --> 34:16.431
Make normal one-third turns.
Come right at 3-4-6.

34:16.525 --> 34:18.766
Try to get a definitive classification.

34:18.860 --> 34:22.940
Secure the engines.
Periscope depth. Answer bells on batteries.

34:23.032 --> 34:27.076
- I want to hear if anybody's out there.
- Aye, sir. Kill the engines.

34:34.168 --> 34:38.001
Conn-sonar.
Captain, we've lost the contact.

34:39.507 --> 34:44.299
- Continue course and speed.
- Aye, sir. Continue course and speed.

34:44.387 --> 34:48.338
Sonar originally classified this contact
as a possible submarine.

34:48.434 --> 34:53.261
- Now they think it was a diesel engine.
- If it's a diesel contact, then it's not a sub.

34:53.355 --> 34:55.478
Aye, sir.

34:55.565 --> 34:59.433
Wait. Better check it outjust to make sure.

34:59.528 --> 35:03.396
- Bring me to single-ping range.
- That'll give away our position.

35:03.491 --> 35:06.942
Minimal risk with this contact.
Single-ping range, please.

35:09.998 --> 35:16.036
Jeez! Just been pinged big time, sir.
Bearing 0-3-0.

35:16.129 --> 35:20.459
That didn't take long. This could be
the shortest command stint in history.

35:20.551 --> 35:23.302
I knew we shouldn't have
come in from the south.

35:23.387 --> 35:27.432
Nice tactics, Captain Custer.
We should be home in a couple of hours.

35:27.516 --> 35:32.060
<i>It's the Orlando, sir. No question.
I know her machinery signature.</i>

35:32.146 --> 35:37.187
Judging by that ping,
she's about 12,000 yards off and closing.

35:37.277 --> 35:40.112
<i>The Orlando. Carl Knox.</i>

35:40.196 --> 35:43.897
- We still might have time to go deep and run.
- I doubt it.

35:43.992 --> 35:48.405
- Lake, prepare to surface.
- Surface? What for?

35:49.290 --> 35:51.447
I mean aye, sir.

35:51.542 --> 35:56.168
Sir, respectfully, I can't concur with
your decision to surrender this quickly.

35:56.254 --> 35:59.505
I'm proud of you.
Once we're on top, run on one screw only.

35:59.592 --> 36:04.834
Rig for red. And, Howard, send somebody
forward with a drop light and duck tape.

36:04.930 --> 36:08.134
<i>What is this, a scavenger hunt?</i>

36:08.225 --> 36:12.473
Mr Jackson, you look like
you could use some fresh air.

36:12.563 --> 36:14.271
Uh, no.

36:15.900 --> 36:20.776
Conn-sonar. We have
the contact steady at 5,000 yards.

36:20.864 --> 36:26.488
- Come to periscope depth.
- Make your depth 6-4 feet, ahead two-thirds.

36:32.418 --> 36:37.127
RJ, I want you to climb the periscope
and put that lamp up on top of it.

36:37.215 --> 36:39.706
- All the way up there, sir?
- Yes.

36:39.801 --> 36:45.637
Look, I need an athlete and
you're the only one I got, so get going.

36:55.317 --> 36:57.439
Oh, shit. Agh!

36:57.528 --> 37:03.234
Hang on, RJ. You're not getting out of it
that easy. Now get your butt up there.

37:05.202 --> 37:08.156
I never saw this shit
on the recruiting poster.

37:08.247 --> 37:13.243
- All right. Lash the lamp to the scope.
- OK, OK.

37:14.588 --> 37:16.664
Passing 9-0 feet.

37:19.926 --> 37:21.800
Got it, sir.

37:21.887 --> 37:24.128
?Be all that you can be

37:24.222 --> 37:26.345
That's the army song, Jackson.

37:26.433 --> 37:28.972
Raise the periscope!

37:34.900 --> 37:37.392
Sonar, plug that in.
Running lights on.

37:37.486 --> 37:39.728
- Running lights?
- Turn 'em on!

37:39.822 --> 37:42.230
We are not running silent. Listen up.

37:56.090 --> 37:58.247
Oh, my Lord, what is that?

37:59.927 --> 38:03.544
Looks like nothing but a fishing trawler.

38:29.000 --> 38:31.076
Captain.

38:31.501 --> 38:34.039
Listen to this.

38:46.059 --> 38:51.563
Perfect. We just chased down
a boatload of beered-up fishermen.

38:52.691 --> 38:57.104
Come to north at full speed.
Set your depth at 200 feet.

39:01.408 --> 39:06.949
Contact is breaking off, sir.
Leaving the area fast and noisy.

39:07.038 --> 39:09.827
I... I think we did it, sir.

39:14.297 --> 39:16.538
<i>- Pay up.
- Well done.</i>

39:16.632 --> 39:21.046
Mr Pascal, let's go to Charleston harbour
and blow something up.

39:21.138 --> 39:23.344
Now we're talking.

39:23.432 --> 39:27.097
Are we really going to
blow something up, sir?

39:27.185 --> 39:30.389
No, no, Sonar. We'll just use flares.

39:33.568 --> 39:38.064
Well, the storm's passed.
Not a word on Dodge.

39:38.156 --> 39:41.525
Appears he doesn't want to
come near the engagement area.

39:41.617 --> 39:46.694
Too bad for me. That's why you invited me to
Charleston, to gloat that he didn't show up?

39:46.789 --> 39:51.332
No, sir. Not at all.
Dodge was simply outclassed.

39:51.419 --> 39:55.797
I've never lost a war game,
and I'm not about to start right now.

39:55.882 --> 40:00.591
- I'm in line for a third star.
- Oh, my God. I'll no longer outrank you.

40:00.679 --> 40:05.009
<i>- What a horrifying thought.</i>

40:05.684 --> 40:10.430
- Oh, boy, look at the fireworks.
- No, I believe that's a flare.

40:12.859 --> 40:15.480
Oh, no. It can't be!

40:22.326 --> 40:25.114
<i>Chalk one up for the diesel navy!</i>

40:25.205 --> 40:28.705
He got Charleston. One down, one to go.

40:28.792 --> 40:30.785
- Yeah!
- Damn it to hell.

40:30.878 --> 40:36.917
War game record's starting to look shaky,
not to mention that third star.

40:37.009 --> 40:42.596
I don't know how he pulled this stunt off,
but I guarantee you one thing, sir.

40:42.682 --> 40:46.514
There will not be a repeat
of this embarrassment

40:46.602 --> 40:51.264
because I will have his tattooed hide
nailed to my office door.

40:59.258 --> 41:01.831
- What is this doing here?
- This?

41:01.927 --> 41:05.675
It's to remind me what I'll be driving
next year instead of this.

41:05.764 --> 41:08.136
How do you figure that?

41:08.225 --> 41:10.218
I got four months to go in the navy.

41:10.311 --> 41:13.976
I'll play in the CBA until some
NBA team need a point guard.

41:14.065 --> 41:17.932
- Then I pick up my ride.
- Another loser fantasy.

41:18.027 --> 41:21.811
Loser? At least I can say
I played in front of 19,000 people.

41:21.906 --> 41:24.444
What the hell have you ever done?

41:24.534 --> 41:28.864
More than you know, including
being chauffeured around in your dream car.

41:28.955 --> 41:32.372
The only you ever been chauffeured
around in is a paddy wagon.

41:32.459 --> 41:35.081
- 50 bucks.
- It's a bet.

41:35.170 --> 41:37.957
Big Jimmy, a guy I owed money to, had one.

41:38.049 --> 41:42.260
His boys threw me in the trunk
and they dumped me naked in the country.

41:42.345 --> 41:46.425
Nice car. Even the trunk
had cut-pile carpeting.

41:46.516 --> 41:50.300
Gimme the money. Pay it up.
50 bucks. Ulysses S Grant.

41:51.980 --> 41:55.230
- That is so nasty.
- I'm sorry. A little dusty in here.

41:58.861 --> 42:02.147
- Admiral Graham on the radio for you, sir.
- Thank you.

42:02.241 --> 42:05.941
- Patching you through.
- Radio's working like a Swiss...

42:06.036 --> 42:07.234
car.

42:07.329 --> 42:09.405
Dodge here.

42:10.916 --> 42:12.992
"Stairway To Heaven."

42:13.962 --> 42:16.453
Led Zeppelin, 1971, right?

42:16.548 --> 42:23.001
OK! Good news, guys. We've just won the
Billy Joel tickets and the WROK T-shirts.

42:23.096 --> 42:26.050
Nitro, do you want to get me
Admiral Graham now?

42:26.140 --> 42:28.217
OK.

42:40.155 --> 42:42.279
<i>It's a little tickle.</i>

42:42.366 --> 42:44.857
Go ahead, sir. Try it now.

42:44.952 --> 42:48.784
Hello, Admiral Graham.
Called to congratulate me?

42:50.083 --> 42:54.211
I'd say the weather was
the determining factor, wouldn't you?

42:55.046 --> 42:57.619
<i>- All part of my strategy, sir.
- Uh-huh.</i>

42:57.715 --> 43:03.802
Look, Dodge, for the rest of this exercise,
there's been a reconfiguration.

43:03.888 --> 43:05.086
Shoot.

43:05.181 --> 43:10.888
<i>Your new orders are to operate
only in sections 3A and 3B.</i>

43:10.980 --> 43:16.651
And, as usual, you will surrender
upon confirmation of a shooting solution.

43:16.735 --> 43:20.151
But that cuts the containment
area in half, sir.

43:20.240 --> 43:25.826
- Does Admiral Winslow know about this?
- He is not administering this war game.

43:26.287 --> 43:29.870
You have your orders, Captain.
Do you read me?

43:29.959 --> 43:32.793
- Loud and clear.
- Good.

43:32.877 --> 43:36.958
And, Dodge, remember... just a game.

43:43.889 --> 43:45.716
Buckman!

43:45.808 --> 43:49.853
There was a fingernail in my food,
you fat-ass moron.

43:49.937 --> 43:52.559
Yesterday, it was a Band-Aid!

43:52.648 --> 43:55.934
Sorry, sir. The Band-Aid
was holding the fingernail on.

43:56.027 --> 44:01.402
- What else do you put in your sauces?
- It's an old family recipe, sir. It's a secret.

44:01.491 --> 44:05.358
Oh, my God.
There's cockroaches in the flour.

44:05.454 --> 44:07.945
Your cigar ash is in the spaghetti.

44:10.668 --> 44:14.878
<i>Jesus, Buckman. This stuff's been
on the Stingray since Korea.</i>

44:14.964 --> 44:17.123
This can expired in 1966.

44:18.842 --> 44:20.918
It still tastes like creamed corn.

44:21.011 --> 44:24.380
- Except it's devilled ham!
- That would be a problem.

44:24.473 --> 44:27.677
The captain's gonna hear about this.

44:38.571 --> 44:41.110
Nobody saw that.

44:42.075 --> 44:47.117
You should more careful, sir.
Remember, when you rush, that's when accidents happen.

44:47.206 --> 44:49.282
Shut up, Buckman!

45:03.431 --> 45:05.508
Uh-oh.

45:09.354 --> 45:13.602
Excuse me, sir,
but I'm picking up all kinds of stuff.

45:17.530 --> 45:19.606
Up periscope.

45:22.744 --> 45:25.235
Oh, my God. Three destroyers and a frigate.

45:25.330 --> 45:29.658
Active pinging, sir.
From aircraft sonar buoys.

45:32.796 --> 45:35.417
Down periscope. Emergency deep.

45:35.507 --> 45:40.466
<i>- Rig for silent running. Battle stations.
- All ahead full.</i>

45:40.553 --> 45:43.839
All planes on full dive.

45:43.933 --> 45:46.340
Full negative to the mark.

45:46.435 --> 45:48.427
- Passing 100.
- What's going on?

45:48.521 --> 45:53.065
- Any way I can cause a problem?
- No, we're pretty well covered for now.

45:53.150 --> 45:55.821
- Shit.
- Passing 120.

45:55.903 --> 45:58.940
Let the air out.
We got to get below that P3 sonar.

45:59.031 --> 46:03.528
- 20 degrees down bubble.
- Take her all the way down to the bottom.

46:03.620 --> 46:05.862
- To the bottom?
- Confuses their sonar.

46:05.955 --> 46:09.905
They can't distinguish between us
and the ocean floor.

46:20.596 --> 46:24.179
- Passing 300 feet.
- Approaching the bottom, sir.

46:24.266 --> 46:27.387
I can hear a couple of
lobsters duking it out.

46:27.478 --> 46:32.437
Two degrees down bubble.
No, one-and-a-half degrees down bubble.

46:32.525 --> 46:34.517
- Everything in hand?
- Yes, sir.

46:34.611 --> 46:38.940
- Didn't do much bottoming on the simulator.
- Nothing to it. Piece of cake.

46:39.032 --> 46:41.109
One degree down bubble.

46:41.201 --> 46:43.159
No. Yes.

46:46.916 --> 46:50.166
Approximately ten feet to bottom, sir.

46:50.253 --> 46:52.922
All stop. Half-degree down bubble.

47:02.265 --> 47:04.638
Conn-sonar. Hot noise in the water.

47:12.442 --> 47:16.025
- What did it sound like?
- It was loud, sir. Two heavy bangs.

47:18.866 --> 47:21.986
Nice job, Lake. Like dropping a piano.

47:22.077 --> 47:25.114
Why don't you do it again
in case they didn't hear you?

47:25.206 --> 47:30.829
It's all right. Everybody back to stations.
Begin damage check.

47:30.920 --> 47:35.796
All hands, we are now going silent.
Repeat, full silent.

47:42.808 --> 47:46.972
P3's reported possible submarine.
Approximately 9,000 yards.

47:47.062 --> 47:49.139
Shall I go active?

47:49.231 --> 47:52.435
Passive sonar only.
Let's not give away our position.

48:07.251 --> 48:10.370
Chin up, Lake, it wasn't your fault.

48:44.456 --> 48:48.454
This is the approximate area
of the last sonar buoy contact, sir.

48:48.543 --> 48:51.296
Don't hear anything,
but they may be playing possum.

48:54.966 --> 48:58.171
Gimme a pack of gum. The Fruit Stripe.

49:00.473 --> 49:03.593
That's 25. Chew it silently.

49:09.608 --> 49:12.728
<i>Sir. It's the Orlando.</i>

49:13.402 --> 49:16.239
Somebody just dropped 45 cents.

49:17.156 --> 49:21.571
- You're sure?
- Oh, yeah. A quarter and two dimes.

50:02.245 --> 50:04.820
Hear something?

50:04.916 --> 50:10.206
Yeah. Almost sounded like... an explosion.

50:38.117 --> 50:40.157
Oh, man!

50:53.425 --> 50:57.090
- Anything else?
- Not yet.

51:12.278 --> 51:14.817
Somebody needs to sew his ass shut.

52:53.344 --> 52:55.420
Is it a biologic?

52:56.387 --> 52:59.224
Sounds like a whale.

53:04.772 --> 53:07.607
It must be a whale. It's moving around.

53:17.577 --> 53:19.866
Now it sounds like there's two of 'em.

53:38.307 --> 53:41.012
Ahh, the heck with it. False alarm.

53:41.101 --> 53:43.889
Back to periscope depth. Ahead full.

54:03.667 --> 54:05.210
<i>Orl...</i>

54:05.293 --> 54:09.208
<i>Orlando, sir. 300 yards and opening.</i>

54:10.341 --> 54:14.255
OK. Somebody find Buckman,
launch him out of a torpedo tube.

54:14.346 --> 54:18.426
XO, let's get this boat moving,
course 0-2-7, and vent this smoke.

54:18.517 --> 54:21.089
- Sir, that's out of the quadrant.
- Yes, it is.

54:21.186 --> 54:26.061
I must protest. We have orders from Admiral
Graham to stay in this containment area.

54:26.149 --> 54:31.938
I know my orders, XO. Course 0-2-7.
When we're clear, surface and run all full.

54:32.030 --> 54:35.482
Stepanak. You missed an opportunity there.

54:35.576 --> 54:39.408
One noise from you,
we could have been in a world of trouble.

54:39.497 --> 54:43.910
That would have been unethical, sir.
I'm only out to screw myself.

54:44.001 --> 54:47.121
That would have screwed everybody.

55:10.780 --> 55:12.903
Live to fight another day, Captain Poon.

55:45.149 --> 55:47.723
Permission to enter, Lt Lake.

55:55.660 --> 55:59.444
- Lt Lake?
- I didn't give you permission to enter.

55:59.539 --> 56:03.703
Well, sometimes a captain
must take unilateral action.

56:04.837 --> 56:09.131
- I could have you put on report.
- Pfft! Be my guest.

56:10.301 --> 56:17.015
Look, Lake. There is no way you could know
what the contour of the ocean floor was like.

56:17.099 --> 56:21.145
- It was as much my fault as anybody's.
- No. It was mine.

56:21.979 --> 56:28.018
I don't have the necessary training to
continue to be the dive officer on this boat.

56:28.110 --> 56:30.863
Especially given your high-risk manoeuvres.

56:30.947 --> 56:37.828
Let me be the judge of that. No one could
have set us down in any better condition.

56:37.914 --> 56:45.044
Sir, I not only gave away our position,
I potentially endangered the crew.

56:45.671 --> 56:49.965
Would you be this easy on me
if I was a properly experienced sailor?

56:50.885 --> 56:53.802
I'd like to think so.

56:57.768 --> 57:00.223
Thank you, Captain.

57:01.521 --> 57:03.597
Good night.

57:04.232 --> 57:06.309
Good night.

57:08.487 --> 57:10.776
Sir...

57:11.949 --> 57:14.867
The Murmansk brushing incident.

57:16.077 --> 57:18.534
How did you get over that?

57:20.500 --> 57:22.706
Got drunk and passed out.

57:22.793 --> 57:27.006
Woke up the next morning
with a hangover and a tattoo.

57:27.089 --> 57:30.008
I wouldn't recommend the tattoo.

57:35.682 --> 57:38.885
- Polishing the old torpedo, sir?
- Shut up, Stepanak.

57:38.977 --> 57:42.642
- Thank you, sir. It's nice to be noticed.
- Oh, get out.

57:42.732 --> 57:45.899
Come on. Get back to bed!

58:00.751 --> 58:03.871
May I have a word with you in private, sir?

58:03.962 --> 58:06.038
Sure.

58:11.720 --> 58:14.129
Sir...

58:14.223 --> 58:19.977
Your decision to leave the engagement zone is
a direct violation of our standing orders.

58:20.062 --> 58:22.138
I'm aware of that, XO.

58:22.231 --> 58:25.766
And now we appear to have
broken off radio contact.

58:25.860 --> 58:29.027
You are right on top of
things as usual, Marty.

58:29.114 --> 58:32.779
Captain, we are not following
the parameters of this exercise.

58:32.868 --> 58:34.944
I have been individually briefed.

58:35.037 --> 58:40.279
I believe we are following
the spirit of this exercise, its intent.

58:40.375 --> 58:43.827
And I believe that you are deluded.

58:45.256 --> 58:48.008
You've hijacked your own boat.

58:48.091 --> 58:54.594
I think it's my duty to inform the crew that
we are operating outside of the navy's control

58:54.682 --> 58:58.466
and ask you to relinquish command.

58:59.520 --> 59:02.225
- Relinquish command.
- Yes, sir.

59:03.067 --> 59:05.143
To who?

59:06.779 --> 59:08.855
To me.

59:11.241 --> 59:13.317
Excuse me.

59:14.119 --> 59:16.408
Captain! Sir.

59:17.080 --> 59:21.411
Sir? I checked the manual
and I am well within my rights.

59:21.502 --> 59:23.958
All hands, this is the captain speaking.

59:24.047 --> 59:28.127
Executive Officer Martin Pascal
has something he'd like to say to you.

59:33.431 --> 59:35.507
Men...

59:36.643 --> 59:38.303
XO Pascal here.

59:38.395 --> 59:43.223
I feel it is my duty to inform you

59:43.317 --> 59:46.816
that we are no longer
in contact with COMSUBLANT.

59:46.904 --> 59:50.190
And we have left the containment area,

59:50.283 --> 59:55.111
in direct violation of orders
from Admiral Graham.

59:55.205 --> 59:58.159
The captain does not deny this.

59:59.751 --> 01:00:04.709
So I need, I would like, your support

01:00:04.797 --> 01:00:11.133
<i>in asking that the captain hand over
command of the Stingray</i>

01:00:12.765 --> 01:00:15.137
to me.

01:00:18.438 --> 01:00:21.521
Marty Pascal. God bless you all.

01:00:29.741 --> 01:00:31.983
This is Captain Tom Dodge.

01:00:32.076 --> 01:00:38.613
No one has ever been court-martialled
for following the captain's orders.

01:00:38.708 --> 01:00:42.658
However, if any of you would like
to support Pascal, you may speak up now

01:00:42.754 --> 01:00:47.465
without fear of punishment
or reprisal from me.

01:01:00.398 --> 01:01:05.605
Well, Mr Pascal, looks like
you're guilty of attempted mutiny.

01:01:05.695 --> 01:01:09.361
That's absurd. These men love me!

01:01:11.452 --> 01:01:15.284
Mr Stepanak, would you
come to the control room, please?

01:01:15.371 --> 01:01:18.824
♪ Come all ye young fellows
who follow the sea

01:01:18.918 --> 01:01:21.789
♪ Yo-ho and blow the man down

01:01:21.879 --> 01:01:25.164
♪ It's time to be bathing Lieutenant Marty

♪ Blow that nutso kooky punk back downtown

Captain Blood, bring forth the prisoner.

01:01:50.159 --> 01:01:54.821
- Hey, Nitro. Ain't that one of my chickens?
- No, it's a parrot.

01:01:54.915 --> 01:01:58.746
- From the Caribbean.
- Don't let it fly away. That's supper.

01:01:58.834 --> 01:02:00.245
Aar.

01:02:08.428 --> 01:02:13.885
<i>Mr Pascal. Have you any last words
before you walk the plank, sir?</i>

01:02:13.976 --> 01:02:18.223
You can't do this, you maniac.
This is the modern navy!

01:02:18.314 --> 01:02:20.390
People don't walk the plank.

01:02:20.483 --> 01:02:24.148
Cap'n Blood, consign him to the briny deep!

01:02:25.696 --> 01:02:29.481
Sonar, play me a dirge, matey.

01:02:48.678 --> 01:02:53.306
Luck be with ye, Mr Pascal. Walk!

01:02:53.392 --> 01:02:57.972
This is crazy! This can't be happening.

01:02:58.063 --> 01:03:01.397
You've lost it, Dodge.
You've gone round the bend.

01:03:01.485 --> 01:03:05.351
You'll hang for this.
Stop or you'll all hang.

01:03:05.446 --> 01:03:10.571
Eternal ocean from which we came,
receive Lt Martin Pascal.

01:03:10.660 --> 01:03:16.117
May God have mercy on his soul.

01:03:16.208 --> 01:03:20.335
Now you're mine, maggot.
Watch that last step.

01:03:20.921 --> 01:03:23.080
Mommy!

01:03:26.052 --> 01:03:28.887
The US Navy thanks you
for your help, gentlemen.

01:03:28.971 --> 01:03:30.964
Any time.

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:33.931
You bastard, Dodge!

01:03:34.226 --> 01:03:35.258
Oh!

01:03:39.274 --> 01:03:42.690
That wasn't so bad, was it, Lieutenant?

01:03:43.403 --> 01:03:48.232
All right. All hands below.
We're going back inside the containment area.

01:03:57.501 --> 01:04:02.626
- He made him walk the plank?!
- Sir, this exercise has gotten out of hand.

01:04:02.716 --> 01:04:06.843
Not only has he violated
the rules of this war game,

01:04:06.928 --> 01:04:10.796
but he's gone AWOL
with US government property.

01:04:10.891 --> 01:04:14.390
- The man should be court-martialled.
- But you can't find him.

01:04:14.478 --> 01:04:22.391
I don't have to. Dodge wouldn't have pushed it
unless he planned to make a run on Norfolk.

01:04:22.486 --> 01:04:25.855
<i>- I'll be waiting for him.
- You'll be waiting for him?</i>

01:04:25.948 --> 01:04:32.746
Yes, sir. I plan on taking charge
of his capture. Personally.

01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:28.094
Yeah, there are about 15 ships out there.
They got 'em set up like a picket line.

01:05:28.181 --> 01:05:30.672
They must know we're coming.

01:05:31.350 --> 01:05:34.019
Down periscope.

01:05:35.646 --> 01:05:39.312
- Attention on deck.
- It's all right, men. Carry on.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:41.607
Welcome aboard, sir.

01:05:41.694 --> 01:05:45.775
Just what the hell is
that supposed to mean?

01:05:45.865 --> 01:05:49.816
I haven't been getting much sleep.
Everything's set to go, right?

01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:53.494
- Yes, sir. The harbour is blockaded.
- Good.

01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:56.583
Have all surface ships
begin their sonar search.

01:05:56.669 --> 01:05:59.041
Aye-aye, sir. Submerge the boat.

01:05:59.130 --> 01:06:03.673
Now, gentlemen, now! Let's go.
Like it already happened.

01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:06.333
Active sonars in all quadrants, sir.

01:06:06.429 --> 01:06:10.473
Air, ship, ocean floor sensors.
They got everything on.

01:06:10.558 --> 01:06:11.804
Aar!

01:06:11.893 --> 01:06:17.683
No surprise. From here on out,
no unnecessary conversation.

01:06:18.984 --> 01:06:23.978
We have a faint echo, Captain.
15,000 yards at three-four-niner.

01:06:24.072 --> 01:06:25.531
Track steady.

01:06:32.999 --> 01:06:38.539
We're being actively pinged, sir.
Repeat, active sonar, 12,000 yards.

01:06:38.629 --> 01:06:43.624
Steady on course.
Keep an ear out for commercial traffic.

01:06:44.969 --> 01:06:47.010
11,000 yards and closing.

01:06:47.096 --> 01:06:51.557
- OK, let's prepare torpedo guidance.
- Aye, sir. Prepare torpedo guidance.

01:07:03.489 --> 01:07:06.063
What's the surface traffic like?

01:07:06.158 --> 01:07:13.241
Five destroyers, three frigates
and a commercial supertanker, sir.

01:07:13.332 --> 01:07:16.085
<i>The Denali, out of Philadelphia.</i>

01:07:16.169 --> 01:07:21.840
Ladies and gentlemen, we have fulfilled every
requirement of this mission except one.

01:07:21.924 --> 01:07:23.550
Norfolk.

01:07:23.634 --> 01:07:29.721
Presently there are several ships positioned
outside the harbour to intercept us.

01:07:29.808 --> 01:07:38.231
To get in, we're going to have to use a tactic
that is somewhat bizarre and extremely risky.

01:07:38.318 --> 01:07:41.983
If any of you feel it's not worth it,
please let me know now.

01:07:42.071 --> 01:07:46.733
Sir, I think we'd prefer to go with the
bizarre and risky. It worked for us so far.

01:07:46.826 --> 01:07:51.120
- I think we should continue to kick ass, sir.
- Yeah!

01:07:55.377 --> 01:07:57.666
Very well, then.

01:07:57.755 --> 01:08:00.127
Make for the tanker. All ahead full.

01:08:00.215 --> 01:08:04.047
- The tanker, sir?
- We're going to use it as a hat.

01:08:04.136 --> 01:08:08.086
- How do we get in?
- Right between the screws.

01:08:10.768 --> 01:08:15.347
- Why notjust come up from underneath?
- You got to go through the cavitation.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:19.307
They lose us for 20, 30 seconds,
then all they can pick up is the tanker.

01:08:19.402 --> 01:08:24.693
- I've never done a manoeuvre like that, sir.
- You have. Pinpoint drills on the simulator.

01:08:24.783 --> 01:08:30.488
- Captain, this is way over my head.
- Just focus on your procedures.

01:08:30.581 --> 01:08:34.578
You've all worked so hard, I don't
want to be the one who screws it up.

01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:39.710
- Emily...
- Please. Don't ask me.

01:08:44.053 --> 01:08:47.553
- OK, I'll take it, Lieutenant.
- Thank you, Captain.

01:08:49.475 --> 01:08:53.095
- Make your depth 1-2-5 feet.
- 1-2-5, aye.

01:08:57.649 --> 01:09:01.898
8,000 yards and closing, sir.
Confirm torpedo range.

01:09:01.988 --> 01:09:07.444
- Fix position. Prepare for guidance lock.
- I got you now, Popeye.

01:09:19.048 --> 01:09:22.881
100 yards and closing, sir.
Two minutes to contact.

01:09:22.969 --> 01:09:26.303
- Three degrees down bubble.
- Three degrees, aye.

01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:28.429
Three degrees? Sir?

01:09:29.685 --> 01:09:33.635
- What is it, Lake?
- Nothing, sir.

01:09:40.112 --> 01:09:44.573
- Propeller turbulence is becoming a problem.
- Two degrees down bubble.

01:09:44.658 --> 01:09:48.703
- Make that two-and-half degrees.
- Two-and-a-half degrees, aye.

01:09:48.787 --> 01:09:54.412
- Maybe one-and-a-half, sir.
- Be quiet, Lake, or do it yourself.

01:09:59.382 --> 01:10:03.629
It's getting tough to hold on in this wash.
I must be right behind a prop.

01:10:03.721 --> 01:10:06.840
- One degree left rudder.
- No, sir!

01:10:06.932 --> 01:10:09.423
Chop's heavier to port.
We need right rudder.

01:10:09.518 --> 01:10:13.765
- You know better, get up here and drive.
- I don't think I should, sir.

01:10:13.857 --> 01:10:18.648
You're the only one who can, Lake.
I'm guessing here.

01:10:32.168 --> 01:10:36.295
- All back one-third. Right full rudder.
- Right full rudder, aye.

01:10:41.385 --> 01:10:43.461
Ten feet and closing, sir.

01:10:43.554 --> 01:10:46.839
All ahead two-thirds. Rudder amidships.

01:10:46.933 --> 01:10:50.883
Zero bubble. Steady course 2-7-0.

01:10:50.979 --> 01:10:53.055
Balls to the wall, boys!

01:11:01.156 --> 01:11:04.572
- Stay right full. Hold steady now.
- We're holding, ma'am.

01:11:04.660 --> 01:11:07.198
- Hang with me, Jackson.
- Tight on it.

01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:19.332
Sir, sonar contact is breaking up.
We're having some trouble tracking them.

01:11:19.426 --> 01:11:21.631
What?

01:11:21.720 --> 01:11:24.507
Don't you dare tell me that.

01:11:39.196 --> 01:11:42.031
Conn-engine room. We're taking on water!

01:11:42.116 --> 01:11:44.274
I'll take care of it, sir.

01:11:45.828 --> 01:11:48.995
Maintain course.
Help is on the way.

01:11:57.382 --> 01:11:59.422
<i>Hey, Fowler!</i>

01:11:59.509 --> 01:12:03.341
The leaks are too strong.
We've got to abandon.

01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:05.506
You're not abandoning shit!

01:12:05.598 --> 01:12:10.558
I hate these stinking submarines, but I
sure as hell am not going to die in one.

01:12:10.646 --> 01:12:12.888
Plug those leaks!

01:12:19.531 --> 01:12:21.938
- Bump it up to full.
- Keep your trim.

01:12:22.032 --> 01:12:25.402
One-and-a-half down bubble.
All ahead full.

01:12:35.797 --> 01:12:38.122
Come on, guys, let's work on this one.

01:12:38.216 --> 01:12:40.292
Oh, shit, it's the main.

01:12:43.848 --> 01:12:47.382
Dress rehearsal for hell, boys!

01:13:04.244 --> 01:13:07.281
- You all right, Howard?
- Yeah. Did I miss anything?

01:13:07.372 --> 01:13:09.032
Just a little water.

01:13:21.846 --> 01:13:23.803
- We're through.
- Yeah!

01:13:26.393 --> 01:13:28.884
How about some quesadillas?

01:13:31.648 --> 01:13:34.020
- Nice work, Lake.
- Thank you, sir.

01:13:34.109 --> 01:13:36.267
Spots, Jackson, you too.

01:13:39.072 --> 01:13:43.568
- How you doing back there, Howard?
- We'll be up in a couple of minutes.

01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:47.325
- I just got out of the shower.
- Glad to hear it. Hang in there.

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:52.035
Now, that was fun.

01:14:04.057 --> 01:14:08.885
I'm sorry, sir, but we've lost her.
Nothing out there but commercial traffic.

01:14:08.979 --> 01:14:13.191
I just don't believe it.
I can't goddamn believe it!

01:14:13.275 --> 01:14:17.439
The man's got to be out there somewhere.
He can'tjust have vanished.

01:14:28.041 --> 01:14:30.116
Come in.

01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:33.418
Excuse me, Captain.

01:14:33.505 --> 01:14:36.292
All right, Lieutenant. Yes?

01:14:37.092 --> 01:14:41.469
I was wondering how much longer you would
have waited before doing it right.

01:14:41.555 --> 01:14:44.640
<i>Half a heartbeat.</i>

01:14:44.725 --> 01:14:47.180
You scared the hell out of me, Emily.

01:14:48.019 --> 01:14:51.139
- Permission to speak freely, sir.
- Granted.

01:14:55.445 --> 01:14:57.567
Sir.

01:15:11.253 --> 01:15:14.040
- Hey, Spots.
- Yes, Mr Jackson.

01:15:14.132 --> 01:15:16.622
You know that lay-up
at the end of the army game?

01:15:16.718 --> 01:15:19.089
I know. You were fouled.

01:15:19.178 --> 01:15:22.547
I choked. I just wanted you to know that.

01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:25.511
What are you talking about?
You were tomahawked.

01:15:25.601 --> 01:15:29.551
I'm a mediocre player.
I never started for any team I ever played for.

01:15:29.647 --> 01:15:35.401
Don't give me that. You are NBA material.
You remember that.

01:15:35.487 --> 01:15:38.239
Yeah. I guess you're right.

01:15:38.907 --> 01:15:41.612
What, are you kidding?

01:15:52.922 --> 01:15:56.124
He's not in the area.
He must have headed back out to sea.

01:15:56.217 --> 01:15:59.966
Oh, no. Not him. Not now.

01:16:00.054 --> 01:16:04.266
Trust me. He is out there.

01:16:11.608 --> 01:16:13.767
Uh-oh. Tanker's turning.

01:16:13.861 --> 01:16:16.434
- What?
- It's not going to Norfolk, sir.

01:16:16.530 --> 01:16:19.283
- We're going to be uncovered real soon.
- Damn.

01:16:19.366 --> 01:16:22.285
- You want me to stay with them, sir?
- No.

01:16:22.369 --> 01:16:25.785
<i>We got a lead on the Orlando
and we passed the surface ships.</i>

01:16:25.873 --> 01:16:30.666
- We got to make our run on Norfolk now.
- There's a lot of active sonar out there, sir.

01:16:30.753 --> 01:16:35.629
<i>- Orlando is on definitive search and destroy.
- At least we'll know where she is.</i>

01:16:44.643 --> 01:16:47.597
Got him. 2-5-0, 12,000 yards.

01:16:47.688 --> 01:16:50.606
Christ, he's already ahead of us.

01:16:53.027 --> 01:16:55.185
The admiral has the conn.

01:16:55.279 --> 01:17:00.521
- Admiral, all due respect, this is my boat.
- Not right now it's not. With all due respect.

01:17:00.618 --> 01:17:05.410
Ahead full. Course 2-5-0.

01:17:13.799 --> 01:17:18.461
They're on us, sir. We're being
actively pinged, 11,000 yards and closing.

01:17:18.554 --> 01:17:20.131
Aar!

01:17:20.222 --> 01:17:22.298
Up periscope.

01:17:24.811 --> 01:17:28.060
OK, we've got cloud cover up there.
Low overcast.

01:17:28.148 --> 01:17:32.062
Their planes'll have trouble seeing us.
Surface. We'll run on top.

01:17:32.152 --> 01:17:37.608
All right, everybody, it's time to kick this pig.
Leave Graham squealin' from the feelin'.

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:41.649
- Squeakin' from the freakin'.
- Oinkin' from the boinkin'.

01:17:58.679 --> 01:18:02.179
- 10,000 yards and closing.
- Prepare for torpedo guidance.

01:18:02.266 --> 01:18:04.970
Let's get a shooting solution.

01:18:22.620 --> 01:18:24.910
8,000 yards and closing, sir.

01:18:24.999 --> 01:18:29.163
Radio call for you, cap'n.
Some guy named Gramanhamham.

01:18:29.254 --> 01:18:33.548
- Put it on the overhead.
- Uh, just a minute, sir.

01:18:49.524 --> 01:18:50.603
Aar!

01:18:50.693 --> 01:18:52.851
Go ahead, sir.

01:18:52.945 --> 01:18:57.654
- Dodge here.
- Dodge, this is Admiral Graham.

01:18:57.741 --> 01:19:02.617
<i>I'm on the Orlando.
And I'm putting you on notice.</i>

01:19:02.706 --> 01:19:06.205
When informed of a shooting solution,

01:19:06.292 --> 01:19:10.836
I expect you to acknowledge it in
accordance with the rules of this war game.

01:19:10.922 --> 01:19:16.379
- Since when were rules important to you, sir?
- You watch yourself, Dodge.

01:19:16.470 --> 01:19:21.974
- You are addressing a superior officer.
- No, merely a higher-ranking one.

01:19:22.059 --> 01:19:24.135
Catch us if you can.

01:19:27.731 --> 01:19:30.602
- Gimme all you got, Howard.
- Aye, sir.

01:19:30.693 --> 01:19:34.442
This is what I live for! DBF.

01:19:44.624 --> 01:19:48.123
- What are you doing?
- Whisky thins down the mix.

01:19:48.211 --> 01:19:51.213
Gives us another 50rpms.

01:20:01.350 --> 01:20:03.508
5,000 yards and closing.

01:20:06.647 --> 01:20:09.221
We have guidance lock.

01:20:09.317 --> 01:20:13.445
Report when you have a shooting solution.
Put on some speed.

01:20:24.583 --> 01:20:27.584
<i>Orlando 3,000 yards and closing.</i>

01:20:27.670 --> 01:20:31.714
Conn-torpedo.
Request permission to arm flare, sir.

01:20:31.799 --> 01:20:35.927
<i>- Hell, no. Ready torpedo tubes one and two.
- Aye, sir.</i>

01:20:36.679 --> 01:20:39.253
Torpedoes?

01:20:39.349 --> 01:20:41.425
Trust me.

01:20:42.352 --> 01:20:47.310
- 1100 yards to target and closing.
- Ha-cha-cha!

01:20:47.399 --> 01:20:49.475
Up periscope.

01:20:56.449 --> 01:20:58.276
Seal.

01:20:58.369 --> 01:21:00.277
Squawk on hands-free.

01:21:01.997 --> 01:21:05.829
- Bearing mark.
- 2-6-3.

01:21:05.918 --> 01:21:07.994
Range 9-0-0.

01:21:08.088 --> 01:21:11.042
- Second mark, sir?
- Haven't got the time.

01:21:11.133 --> 01:21:13.705
Bearing 2-6-3.

01:21:13.801 --> 01:21:15.924
- Fire one.
- Fire one.

01:21:20.642 --> 01:21:26.348
Bearing 2-6-4. Range 8-5-0.

01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:28.895
- Fire two.
- Fire two.

01:21:36.784 --> 01:21:39.571
- Sir, we have a shooting solution.
- Well!

01:21:39.662 --> 01:21:42.367
<i>Get the Stingray.
Give them the coordinates.</i>

01:21:42.457 --> 01:21:48.994
I want to tell them. He's targeted.
If he has the guts to acknowledge.

01:21:50.005 --> 01:21:54.752
Sir, it's that General Whatshisname again.

01:21:54.845 --> 01:21:57.845
Forget the phone. Put it on the squawk.

01:21:57.932 --> 01:22:00.008
OK. Yes, sir.

01:22:11.487 --> 01:22:15.983
<i>Submarine "Stingray",
this is submarine "Orlando".</i>

01:22:16.076 --> 01:22:18.400
It has been confirmed.

01:22:18.494 --> 01:22:20.154
You are targeted.

01:22:20.831 --> 01:22:24.875
<i>Orlando, this is Stingray.
Stingray one speaking.</i>

01:22:24.961 --> 01:22:29.171
We acknowledge the kill and
congratulate all the fine men on your boat.

01:22:29.257 --> 01:22:31.295
Well, thank you, Captain.

01:22:31.383 --> 01:22:37.137
However, at the time of your transmission
I had already fired two torpedoes.

01:22:37.598 --> 01:22:41.133
- What?!
- You can probably hear them in the water.

01:22:41.227 --> 01:22:46.851
And though we are dead, our fish are on
their way to the naval station dummy ship.

01:22:46.941 --> 01:22:50.607
They hit, we still win.

01:22:50.695 --> 01:22:52.735
Aar-harr!

01:22:55.450 --> 01:22:58.120
You son of a bitch.

01:22:58.203 --> 01:23:00.825
Were those hot torpedoes or exercise shots?

01:23:00.915 --> 01:23:04.663
Sir, our fish are running hot,
straight and normal.

01:23:04.752 --> 01:23:09.295
If we aimed them right,
any kills should be visible in your scope.

01:23:14.595 --> 01:23:16.754
Ten seconds.

01:23:16.847 --> 01:23:21.556
Nine, eight, seven,

01:23:22.186 --> 01:23:24.974
<i>six, five,</i>

01:23:25.065 --> 01:23:28.315
four, three,

01:23:28.402 --> 01:23:31.272
two, one...

01:23:37.453 --> 01:23:40.240
- Sweet!
- Aar!

01:23:41.165 --> 01:23:43.241
Yes!

01:23:45.044 --> 01:23:47.796
God, I love this job!

01:23:47.880 --> 01:23:50.551
Aar-harr-harr!

01:25:06.421 --> 01:25:10.289
Sir, this exercise is invalid.
Dodge left the containment area...

01:25:10.384 --> 01:25:13.551
After you had narrowed it
without authorisation.

01:25:13.638 --> 01:25:16.307
He ignored a direct order.

01:25:16.390 --> 01:25:22.928
Stow it, Yancy. He had higher orders.
And you can forget about that third star.

01:25:41.084 --> 01:25:43.160
Crew, halt.

01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:47.497
Crew, salute.

01:25:51.094 --> 01:25:54.463
Welcome back. You pushed
my order to the breaking point.

01:25:54.555 --> 01:25:57.841
Thank you, sir.
I mean, if that's a compliment.

01:25:57.935 --> 01:26:00.640
However, under the circumstances,

01:26:00.728 --> 01:26:06.103
I will not be able to give you your own
Los Angeles class nuclear submarine.

01:26:06.193 --> 01:26:07.308
Yes, sir.

01:26:07.403 --> 01:26:11.863
You will be given instead
a new Seawolf class nuclear submarine

01:26:11.950 --> 01:26:14.522
and will attend its launching on Friday.

01:26:14.618 --> 01:26:17.109
And this time you'll be
given a proper crew,

01:26:17.204 --> 01:26:21.037
one commensurate with
your tactical and leadership abilities.

01:26:21.125 --> 01:26:24.411
- Thank you, sir, but I'd have to decline.
- Decline?

01:26:24.504 --> 01:26:29.296
I would not be in line for such a promotion
without the help of my present crew.

01:26:29.384 --> 01:26:35.886
I could not in good conscience
accept another command without them.

01:26:36.725 --> 01:26:41.221
- Still setting terms, huh, Dodge?
- Just respectfully requesting, sir.

01:26:44.025 --> 01:26:48.604
Well, at least you got
my son to face forward.

01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:54.987
Your son? Stepanak, sir?

01:26:55.078 --> 01:26:57.866
Yes. It's his mother's name.

01:26:59.123 --> 01:27:01.661
His salute still leaves
something to be desired.

01:27:01.751 --> 01:27:05.416
- We'll work on that, sir.
- You do that, Commander.

01:27:15.307 --> 01:27:16.552
Dismissed!

01:27:26.528 --> 01:27:29.694
Live it up, guys. You earned it.

01:27:29.781 --> 01:27:33.909
Thank you, sir. I'll try not to overdo it.

01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:39.332
What exactly is this tattoo
I keep hearing about?

01:27:39.416 --> 01:27:42.951
Well, it's a long story.

01:27:43.045 --> 01:27:50.625
It was just after the Murmansk brushing incident.
I believe you're familiar with that?
