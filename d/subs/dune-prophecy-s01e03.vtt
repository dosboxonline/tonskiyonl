WEBVTT

02:07.460 --> 02:08.461
Come.

02:09.629 --> 02:13.132
We must act quickly
to maintain our hold on the Great Houses.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.842
What about the Emperor?

02:14.843 --> 02:16.969
You've been barred from the palace.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.598
This is not the first time
an adversary has sought to remove me.

02:21.349 --> 02:23.727
Like the others, this soldier will learn.

02:50.962 --> 02:52.297
You have to get underneath it!

03:05.101 --> 03:07.103
- They're all the same.
- How much for this one?

03:07.771 --> 03:09.022
Same as every day.

03:09.689 --> 03:10.690
Yes?

03:11.524 --> 03:12.525
What do you want?

03:17.655 --> 03:19.449
- The usual.
- I'll take that one. The big one.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.572
I should've just done the shopping myself.

04:00.699 --> 04:02.408
Even your younger sister
has the good sense

04:02.409 --> 04:04.035
to request decent cuts of meat.

04:04.536 --> 04:05.994
Perhaps you should've sent Tula, then.

04:05.995 --> 04:07.454
Oh, well, she was busy preparing

04:07.455 --> 04:09.123
- the rest of the meal.
- Mum, I don't mind.

04:09.124 --> 04:12.502
Thank you both, sisters,
for procuring and preparing this meal.

04:13.545 --> 04:15.213
Your uncle has no complaints.

04:17.215 --> 04:18.632
You're really going to Zimia, Griffin?

04:18.633 --> 04:20.677
Well, the Landsraad accepted our petition.

04:21.011 --> 04:22.012
When I get there,

04:22.679 --> 04:24.681
I'm gonna get us a better trade deal.

04:25.015 --> 04:26.974
I admire your mettle, son.

04:26.975 --> 04:29.768
His whale fur
will always be a prized export.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.062
You mock, but it's a fact.

04:32.063 --> 04:37.027
I'd like to shove it in Vorian's face
once you've made your mark.

04:38.319 --> 04:39.696
I'm gonna miss you, big brother.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.783
Here. I carved this.

04:44.784 --> 04:46.619
For your collection.

04:47.495 --> 04:51.040
What do you mean Vorian? Vorian Atreides?

04:51.041 --> 04:52.666
After doing God knows what,

04:52.667 --> 04:56.546
he's resurfaced,
gallivanting around the Capital.

04:57.756 --> 04:59.299
This is an opportunity.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.216
To do what?

05:01.217 --> 05:04.470
Whale peddling can only take us so far.
If you go and find Vorian...

05:04.471 --> 05:06.764
- Oh, no.
- ...make him understand what happened.

05:06.765 --> 05:09.850
Get him to correct the record
so that we can reclaim our status.

05:09.851 --> 05:11.685
Your father has plenty of status.

05:11.686 --> 05:13.729
Oh, yes. The mayor of peasants.

05:13.730 --> 05:17.024
- Valya.
- Your grandfather, Abulurd Harkonnen,

05:17.025 --> 05:18.401
was a hero.

05:19.069 --> 05:23.238
He didn't commit a war crime.
He tried to stop a genocide.

05:23.239 --> 05:28.243
Vorian Atreides stripped
our family of its honor based on a lie.

05:28.244 --> 05:31.038
We should be leaders of the Imperium.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.875
I don't understand where it comes from.
Your greed, this entitlement.

05:34.876 --> 05:37.544
I don't want to just endure.

05:37.545 --> 05:40.673
This complacency is a disease.

05:40.674 --> 05:43.300
If we don't act now,
it will infect all of us

05:43.301 --> 05:44.593
and all who come after us.

05:44.594 --> 05:47.097
I won't sit by and let it happen!

05:54.229 --> 05:56.730
Griffin, do not follow her.

05:56.731 --> 05:58.107
She's a wolf.

05:58.108 --> 05:59.733
And if you're not careful,

05:59.734 --> 06:01.695
she will devour you.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.721
Is she right?

06:34.269 --> 06:36.938
Am I entitled, greedy?

06:39.149 --> 06:42.277
No. They're not like you, Valya.

06:44.154 --> 06:46.114
You mean like us.

06:52.078 --> 06:55.622
You remember when
I fell through the ice, into that river?

06:55.623 --> 06:57.584
The cold was like a vice.

06:58.126 --> 07:01.087
Soon as I hit that water,
my muscles seized.

07:01.796 --> 07:05.175
And like a fool, you came out after me.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.428
I am the fool who saved you.

07:09.304 --> 07:11.263
I still don't understand how.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.183
I mean, I was sinking.

07:14.601 --> 07:18.562
Then I heard you, your voice in my head,

07:18.563 --> 07:20.648
ordering me to swim.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.821
Because of you, I didn't die that day.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.867
You're not entitled or greedy.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.578
You're extraordinary.

07:34.579 --> 07:37.164
And that's why if you think
the best course of action

07:37.165 --> 07:42.253
is to track down Vorian Atreides
and get him to take back his lies,

07:43.880 --> 07:45.006
I will.

07:47.717 --> 07:51.388
The Imperium will be better
for our contribution, Griffin.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.808
We deserve to make it.

07:56.601 --> 07:59.062
We will. You'll see.

08:25.922 --> 08:31.136
Griffin Harkonnen,
son of Vergyl and Sonia Harkonnen.

08:32.053 --> 08:36.474
You leave behind a family
forever broken by your loss.

08:38.727 --> 08:41.229
You were our family's brightest light.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.858
The ancestors are fortunate
to receive you.

08:51.614 --> 08:53.616
Until we meet again.

09:08.965 --> 09:09.966
Valya.

09:14.929 --> 09:16.306
Come inside.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.517
I don't want to mourn.

09:19.851 --> 09:23.062
Vorian murdered Griffin,
and now he's disappeared again.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.564
It's not fair.

09:25.273 --> 09:27.984
I want the Atreides
to suffer like we have.

09:29.527 --> 09:32.780
But I can't because they're making me
go away to Wallach IX.

09:32.781 --> 09:35.908
Valya, the Sisterhood will help you.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.494
There's only one thing
that'll help me, little sister,

09:38.495 --> 09:41.081
but our family doesn't
have the stomach for it.

09:41.915 --> 09:45.043
An eye for an eye
will never be enough, Valya.

09:46.419 --> 09:49.005
Griffin was worth far more than that.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.220
Whatever path you choose,

09:55.970 --> 09:58.765
don't stay on this nightmare of a planet.

09:59.224 --> 10:02.435
Find something, anything.

10:04.104 --> 10:07.524
All that's left here is death and rot.

10:34.217 --> 10:37.886
If they can cast out Mother Superior,
what does that mean for the Order?

10:37.887 --> 10:41.306
Corrino could call for our dismissal.
Cost us all the Great Houses.

10:41.307 --> 10:44.351
They say he was swallowed
by Shai-Hulud and survived.

10:44.352 --> 10:47.938
What if it's true
that he is touched by the Maker?

10:47.939 --> 10:50.691
How else could he resist
Mother Valya's power?

10:50.692 --> 10:54.153
- Perhaps regroup on Wallach IX.
- Wallach IX?

10:54.154 --> 10:55.612
Our mission is here.

10:55.613 --> 10:56.865
Sisters,

10:57.615 --> 10:59.408
remember your resolve.

10:59.409 --> 11:02.704
Mother Valya, you have our loyalty.

11:03.246 --> 11:05.623
How do you want to proceed?

11:07.709 --> 11:09.501
Return to your nobles.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.546
Counter any attempts
to sow further mistrust.

11:12.547 --> 11:14.841
I will regain our hold on Corrino.

11:19.304 --> 11:20.930
Excuse me a minute.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.147
This came from Tula.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.524
Sister Lila?

11:32.400 --> 11:34.194
She didn't survive the Agony.

11:38.656 --> 11:41.033
I had hoped to reach Raquella for answers.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.912
You did. Raquella spoke through her.

11:44.412 --> 11:47.873
She said the key to the reckoning
was one twice born,

11:47.874 --> 11:50.043
in blood and in spice.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.003
It's Desmond Hart.

11:54.714 --> 11:56.007
What are you gonna do?

12:02.305 --> 12:04.140
I think a trip home is called for.

12:22.158 --> 12:25.412
I thought you could do
with some spice tea.

12:27.455 --> 12:31.959
Mother Valya drinks a cup every day
for clarity of thought,

12:31.960 --> 12:36.131
especially during trying circumstances.

12:37.507 --> 12:38.633
You're grieving.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.803
That's human.

12:44.806 --> 12:46.725
What was it Raquella used to say?

12:47.434 --> 12:52.230
"We must channel our human energy
in the service of the future."

12:52.939 --> 12:56.568
No one has ever returned
from the state this child is in.

12:57.777 --> 13:02.824
Keeping Sister Lila in this limbo
sows pain and confusion.

13:06.578 --> 13:08.788
I am sorry this happened.

13:09.998 --> 13:14.044
But Mother Valya has made it very clear
how we handle cases like this.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.755
We must let her go.

13:19.674 --> 13:21.301
If you would like...

13:23.094 --> 13:25.138
- I could relieve you of your--
- Don't.

13:28.350 --> 13:29.976
Don't touch her.

13:32.103 --> 13:33.772
I will do what needs to be done

13:34.397 --> 13:36.024
when I choose.

13:41.321 --> 13:43.238
Thank you for your care and counsel,
Sister Avila.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.491
That will be all.

15:26.176 --> 15:27.802
- You okay?
- Yeah.

15:34.392 --> 15:37.812
Jet loves it up here.
He remembers the yearly hunt.

15:40.065 --> 15:41.816
It's beautiful.

15:42.734 --> 15:44.277
We're first to arrive.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.571
We can claim whatever quarters we want.

15:48.281 --> 15:50.657
Maybe we should wait
for the rest of your family

15:50.658 --> 15:53.745
- to get here before we--
- You're nervous.

15:54.996 --> 15:57.081
No, I'd like to make a good impression.

15:57.082 --> 15:59.459
But who wouldn't be enchanted by you?

15:59.876 --> 16:01.711
Well, my own family wasn't.

16:03.004 --> 16:04.630
It's just, you're so close with yours,

16:04.631 --> 16:07.216
- if they don't approve, then--
- Hey. It's not possible.

16:07.217 --> 16:10.136
They're gonna adore you, like I do.

16:37.539 --> 16:40.834
So, Tula, how'd you meet Orry?

16:42.752 --> 16:46.381
I was at a market,
and he struck up a conversation.

16:49.551 --> 16:51.011
Guess we're still talking.

16:51.761 --> 16:53.304
Have you taken him to meet your people?

16:56.099 --> 16:57.600
There's barely any of us left.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.566
You said we could
shoot target practice this afternoon.

17:04.941 --> 17:08.528
Yes, after the work's done.
We've got firewood to collect.

17:11.281 --> 17:13.158
Continue this later?

17:18.538 --> 17:20.373
I could use a hand.

17:22.292 --> 17:25.462
If you don't mind getting
those hands dirty with blood and guts.

17:26.379 --> 17:27.797
I don't mind that.

17:28.173 --> 17:31.259
To catch the bull,
we need to lure it with bait.

17:32.344 --> 17:33.845
Use this tool.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.556
It smells gross.

17:37.557 --> 17:38.975
To you and me.

17:39.392 --> 17:41.603
To Salusan bull, it smells like dinner.

17:42.270 --> 17:45.815
These bulls are rare, shy creatures.

17:46.358 --> 17:47.900
Without a scent to lure them,

17:47.901 --> 17:50.694
the hunters on horseback
wouldn't stand a chance.

17:50.695 --> 17:52.280
Now, this next part is tricky.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.490
Alright, so you see this?

17:54.491 --> 17:57.368
There's a toxin in there
powerful enough to kill a person.

17:57.369 --> 17:58.827
True strength

17:58.828 --> 18:01.498
isn't always something
you see from the outside.

18:03.541 --> 18:05.959
So, just be careful not to rupture it,

18:05.960 --> 18:07.921
or you'll contaminate everything.

18:09.547 --> 18:10.757
Just remove it gently.

18:11.966 --> 18:12.967
Then...

18:14.594 --> 18:16.805
you dump the innards
in a separate bucket.

18:20.266 --> 18:21.517
Wanna do the next one?

18:21.518 --> 18:22.727
Okay.

18:23.937 --> 18:24.937
Yeah, that's great.

18:24.938 --> 18:26.147
- Then, go...
- Well done.

18:32.737 --> 18:33.905
Jetty!

18:34.489 --> 18:35.573
Hey!

18:41.121 --> 18:42.414
Stay with him!

18:43.373 --> 18:44.749
Stay back! Stay back!

18:46.167 --> 18:47.168
Shattered leg.

18:52.465 --> 18:53.675
What happened?

18:54.092 --> 18:57.012
We were coming down from the ridge
and the path gave way.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.934
Broken, two places. I'm sorry, Orry.

19:03.977 --> 19:06.103
What about a shigawire fuse.
We can splint the breaks.

19:06.104 --> 19:07.604
Horses live on their feet.

19:07.605 --> 19:09.274
Then a suspension sling.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.985
He'll just kick himself to death
trying to get out of it.

19:15.447 --> 19:18.074
We do what we must, Tula.

19:33.757 --> 19:36.676
Just stay with him. I'll be right back.

20:04.329 --> 20:05.330
This will be better.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.630
Yeah.

21:11.187 --> 21:13.606
What is truthsense?

21:14.065 --> 21:17.526
- The science of detecting falsehood.
- That's right.

21:17.527 --> 21:21.823
But it is more
than being a human lie detector.

21:22.490 --> 21:25.076
It is our Order's guiding purpose.

21:26.202 --> 21:27.412
How?

21:27.787 --> 21:30.164
We use it to serve the Imperium.

21:30.165 --> 21:32.459
What if the Imperium's corrupt?

21:33.251 --> 21:37.130
We exert a subtle influence,
call humanity to its better nature.

21:37.630 --> 21:39.883
Are there occasions where
you withhold the truth?

21:40.592 --> 21:41.842
Just because the leaders are told,

21:41.843 --> 21:43.886
it doesn't mean they'll
use it to good ends.

21:43.887 --> 21:45.221
Truth is a tool.

21:46.014 --> 21:48.308
And who should determine
how to use this tool?

21:49.184 --> 21:50.185
You?

21:52.437 --> 21:54.856
You know what truth I see, Sister?

21:55.940 --> 21:59.903
You are scared
because you have nothing to serve,

22:00.612 --> 22:04.365
no purpose, nowhere to put all
that hurt and anger.

22:04.366 --> 22:07.369
You know how truly alone you really are.

22:09.079 --> 22:13.625
Use this truth to motivate your actions.

22:13.958 --> 22:16.169
Tomorrow, you will be tested.

22:16.670 --> 22:19.880
Humble yourself
and commit to the Sisterhood,

22:19.881 --> 22:20.965
or...

22:21.758 --> 22:26.680
resign yourself to an unremarkable life
on a backwater planet.

22:28.515 --> 22:31.142
Now, where were we?

22:33.186 --> 22:35.604
She had no call to read you like that.

22:35.605 --> 22:37.523
You must've really gotten to her.

22:37.524 --> 22:40.902
- It's fine.
- She wasn't always so rigid.

22:41.653 --> 22:45.447
The Sisterhood sent her as an ambassador
to the Butlerians to make inroads.

22:45.448 --> 22:47.784
Instead, she came back as a true believer.

22:48.326 --> 22:51.413
Now she's all about humility
and servitude.

22:51.955 --> 22:53.872
I heard she was next in line
to lead the Order

22:53.873 --> 22:56.166
but now Mother Raquella's not so sure.

22:56.167 --> 22:58.545
Dorotea's far too pious, if you ask me.

22:59.170 --> 23:02.590
I don't care who's next in line
to run the Sisterhood.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.552
Do you even wanna be a Sister?

23:06.344 --> 23:10.223
I was going to be my brother's Truthsayer
when he went to the Landsraad.

23:11.725 --> 23:13.059
Then he was murdered.

23:14.894 --> 23:17.188
- Valya, I'm--
- So sorry.

23:19.566 --> 23:21.776
I didn't want to come after that.

23:22.944 --> 23:25.363
My parents forced me.

23:26.489 --> 23:29.117
They didn't want me on Lankiveil anymore.

23:33.371 --> 23:34.372
What do you want?

23:50.847 --> 23:52.432
Reflect on this.

23:54.017 --> 23:59.397
Would you devote your one small lifetime
to better all of humanity?

24:01.191 --> 24:04.485
Are you able to put
the Sisterhood above all?

24:04.486 --> 24:07.196
Even above your families?

24:07.197 --> 24:10.574
If the answer is yes,
you may return inside.

24:10.575 --> 24:13.453
If not, I encourage you to meditate

24:14.371 --> 24:16.664
on whether or not you belong here.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.841
Sisterhood above all.

24:27.717 --> 24:32.555
Sisterhood above all...
Sisterhood above all...

24:53.243 --> 24:55.912
Sisterhood above all...

25:05.714 --> 25:06.923
Sisterhood above all.

25:07.590 --> 25:09.342
Sisterhood above all!

25:22.313 --> 25:25.399
I'm not interested in a contest of wills,
Sister Valya.

25:25.400 --> 25:29.529
We both know the truth.
You'll always be a Harkonnen.

25:30.030 --> 25:31.031
Come!

26:56.866 --> 26:58.576
<i>Don't move!</i>

27:07.252 --> 27:08.670
Valya Harkonnen?

27:09.254 --> 27:13.133
I am Mother Superior
Raquella Berto-Anirul.

27:14.718 --> 27:16.177
Let's go inside.

27:16.928 --> 27:19.264
I haven't taken my vow.

27:21.474 --> 27:24.102
I'm inviting you to come with me.

27:33.403 --> 27:37.072
Your voice, it stopped me outside.

27:37.073 --> 27:39.159
I've never felt anything like that.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.537
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

27:43.246 --> 27:45.457
Has that ever happened before?

27:46.332 --> 27:49.753
Once, with my brother.

27:51.671 --> 27:52.964
He was drowning.

27:53.548 --> 27:56.801
He said I ordered him
to swim when he couldn't.

27:58.386 --> 28:00.554
Crisis, survival,

28:00.555 --> 28:02.599
advancement.

28:04.225 --> 28:07.854
- What?
- The human race is still evolving.

28:08.480 --> 28:12.108
At the Sisterhood,
we work to advance our species.

28:13.651 --> 28:17.781
We found that adversity
is the key to change.

28:19.699 --> 28:23.453
I'm aware of what happened
to your brother, Griffin.

28:25.663 --> 28:29.458
When I lost my husband
in the Machine Wars,

28:29.459 --> 28:31.753
it was like a limb torn off.

28:33.463 --> 28:36.924
Sometimes, our misfortunes are the sails

28:36.925 --> 28:40.178
that take us to the shores
we are meant to be on.

28:41.262 --> 28:43.973
You can achieve extraordinary things here.

28:44.766 --> 28:47.060
Even shape the course of the Imperium,

28:47.894 --> 28:49.729
if you decide to stay.

29:07.288 --> 29:09.457
- Take this to the fire?
- Of course.

29:47.328 --> 29:50.540
- You should join them.
- I'm right where I want to be.

29:52.542 --> 29:54.753
Don't you need to prepare yourself?

29:56.755 --> 29:58.173
Been a hard day.

30:03.011 --> 30:05.013
How did you know what to do?

30:06.806 --> 30:09.391
My brother taught me
how to handle animals.

30:09.392 --> 30:11.685
He taught me lots of things.

30:11.686 --> 30:13.605
Sounds like a good man.

30:14.647 --> 30:15.982
When do I get to meet him?

30:17.359 --> 30:20.195
I wish you could. He died.

30:25.700 --> 30:27.368
Tula.

30:27.369 --> 30:28.870
He still inspires me,

30:29.371 --> 30:31.998
influences how I live my life.

30:36.419 --> 30:38.421
You don't talk much about your family.

30:41.549 --> 30:44.511
My older sister never much cared for me.

30:45.428 --> 30:48.263
And after he died, she went off to school.

30:48.264 --> 30:51.768
My parents were so grief-stricken,
they barely remembered I existed.

30:53.395 --> 30:55.980
I had to leave home just to be seen.

30:58.942 --> 31:01.361
Hey, look at me.

31:05.031 --> 31:06.658
I see you.

31:11.705 --> 31:14.540
When we marry, you'll have more kin
than you'll know what to do with.

31:14.541 --> 31:17.001
"When we marry." Is that a proposal?

31:17.002 --> 31:18.460
Yeah, maybe.

31:18.461 --> 31:20.171
- Yes?
- Yeah.

31:20.588 --> 31:22.590
Yes, it is.

31:28.847 --> 31:30.265
Tula Veil,

31:31.725 --> 31:32.976
will you marry me?

31:35.437 --> 31:39.065
Orry, it's only been a few months. You--

31:39.858 --> 31:41.734
You don't even really know me.

31:41.735 --> 31:43.820
That's all the time I need.

31:44.362 --> 31:46.364
I wanna give you my life,

31:46.781 --> 31:48.074
my future.

31:54.122 --> 31:55.749
Marry me.

33:22.168 --> 33:25.171
Atreides! Atreides! Atreides!

33:26.381 --> 33:27.716
Atreides! Atreides!

34:18.641 --> 34:22.437
My family, they'll be thrilled.

34:24.314 --> 34:25.774
When they find out

34:26.358 --> 34:29.819
you will soon be joining
the Atreides clan.

34:31.279 --> 34:35.283
I need you to know that I regret
that things are the way they are.

34:36.576 --> 34:39.621
For so long,
all I wanted was to tell you.

34:40.246 --> 34:41.790
Tell me what?

34:46.628 --> 34:48.838
I was afraid if you knew who I really am,

34:49.214 --> 34:52.092
you'd never allow yourself
to get close to me,

34:54.427 --> 34:56.012
or love me.

34:56.680 --> 34:57.972
My love isn't fickle.

34:59.099 --> 35:01.851
Whatever hard truth exists,

35:02.644 --> 35:04.436
we'll deal with it together.

35:04.437 --> 35:06.147
You don't need to be afraid.

35:06.481 --> 35:08.274
My name isn't Tula Veil.

35:09.275 --> 35:10.694
I lied to you.

35:15.824 --> 35:17.659
It's Tula Harkonnen.

35:41.474 --> 35:44.477
I certainly understand
why you didn't wanna tell me.

35:45.770 --> 35:47.772
No one chooses the name they're born with.

35:49.315 --> 35:51.151
Could never blame you for that.

35:51.693 --> 35:54.112
- You don't hate me?
- Hate you?

35:54.904 --> 35:56.906
Nothing would make me hate you.

35:57.240 --> 35:59.366
- Our families would disagree.
- Our families?

35:59.367 --> 36:01.160
Yeah, they choose hate

36:01.161 --> 36:02.871
'cause of what they're taught...

36:04.247 --> 36:09.501
that a disagreement between our ancestors
during wartime over a century ago

36:09.502 --> 36:13.297
should bleed into their future,
but that is their burden,

36:13.298 --> 36:14.382
not ours.

36:21.264 --> 36:24.016
It's okay. I promise it's gonna be okay.

36:24.017 --> 36:25.184
Just listen to me.

36:25.185 --> 36:27.270
We will write a future
for ourselves, okay?

36:31.232 --> 36:34.319
Some things can't be changed, Orry.

36:38.656 --> 36:40.283
My brother.

36:43.161 --> 36:45.287
Griffin will still be dead,

36:45.288 --> 36:48.208
and it will still be an Atreides
who killed him.

36:53.630 --> 36:55.632
We do what we must.

36:57.467 --> 36:59.302
I don't understand.

37:08.353 --> 37:10.397
Why is it so quiet?

37:12.399 --> 37:14.234
You didn't see me.

37:37.340 --> 37:38.717
What?

37:54.482 --> 37:55.900
I'm sorry.

38:32.020 --> 38:33.229
Go.

39:20.819 --> 39:23.278
<i>Beware the seeds you sow</i>

39:23.279 --> 39:25.114
<i>and the crops you reap.</i>

39:25.115 --> 39:30.244
<i>Do not be deceived by those
who come bearing false claims of reform.</i>

39:30.245 --> 39:34.040
They are corruptors, yet they know it not.

39:39.671 --> 39:41.088
Word's spreading.

39:41.089 --> 39:44.299
The Great Houses are becoming
more competitive

39:44.300 --> 39:47.428
over who can secure the next Truthsayer.

39:47.429 --> 39:49.139
An arms race.

39:49.597 --> 39:51.099
That's good.

39:51.933 --> 39:58.105
"Thou shalt not make a machine
in the likeness of a human mind."

39:58.106 --> 40:03.111
Thou shalt not make a machine
in the likeness of a human mind.

40:03.820 --> 40:05.071
Where are we going?

40:05.572 --> 40:06.823
To the tunnels.

40:07.490 --> 40:10.951
It's time I show you my life's great work.

40:10.952 --> 40:12.829
Your great work is underground?

40:13.329 --> 40:15.290
In more ways than one.

40:24.841 --> 40:26.967
From the time of the wars,

40:26.968 --> 40:31.013
we've been gathering DNA
from across the Imperium,

40:31.014 --> 40:36.727
indexing bloodlines,
creating a vast genetic library.

40:36.728 --> 40:39.105
Is that how we play matchmaker
for the Great Houses?

40:39.856 --> 40:41.482
You could say that.

40:41.483 --> 40:45.694
If we identify the best pairings,
bolster the right unions,

40:45.695 --> 40:48.406
we can influence generations to come,

40:49.282 --> 40:54.036
foster better leaders,
ones less prone to corruption and tyranny.

40:54.037 --> 40:56.955
Ones who won't drag us
to the edge of extinction again.

40:56.956 --> 40:58.875
I had a feeling you'd understand.

40:59.709 --> 41:01.126
Not everyone will.

41:01.127 --> 41:02.379
That is correct.

41:05.340 --> 41:09.344
What I'm about to show you
relies on forbidden technology.

41:10.345 --> 41:12.180
I'm trusting you.

41:26.528 --> 41:29.321
You have to swear not to breathe
a word of this to anyone.

41:29.322 --> 41:31.408
- Of course not.
- No one.

41:32.117 --> 41:34.119
It's going to be me.

41:34.869 --> 41:37.288
Mother Raquella is going
to make me her successor.

41:38.498 --> 41:39.873
Did she actually tell you?

41:39.874 --> 41:43.961
She trusts me more than Dorotea.
I can tell it's what she wants.

41:43.962 --> 41:46.214
This is wonderful news.

41:46.715 --> 41:48.340
Do you feel ready?

41:48.341 --> 41:52.845
Not always,
but Raquella has faith in me

41:52.846 --> 41:54.723
and what I've been working on.

41:55.765 --> 41:57.767
What have you been working on?

41:58.309 --> 41:59.519
This.

42:04.649 --> 42:06.359
<i>Face her.</i>

42:11.322 --> 42:12.866
<i>Slap her.</i>

42:23.293 --> 42:25.670
I didn't think it would work so well.

42:32.135 --> 42:34.178
How did you do that?

42:34.179 --> 42:36.222
Can you teach us how to do it?

42:36.931 --> 42:38.933
I was hoping you'd ask.

42:48.026 --> 42:51.029
I imagine you're wondering
why I've called you both in.

42:54.657 --> 42:56.785
I've been watching the two of you.

43:00.705 --> 43:04.417
You are the strongest among us.

43:05.293 --> 43:09.714
You've both pushed the boundaries
of what it means to be human.

43:11.049 --> 43:15.804
I believe that you are both
the future leaders of this Order.

43:16.846 --> 43:20.558
I've also watched you
both amass followers.

43:21.309 --> 43:24.103
Such hubris is divisive.

43:24.104 --> 43:28.525
Our Sisterhood is young,
but growing in power.

43:29.651 --> 43:34.364
The more influence we gain,
the more enemies we make.

43:38.076 --> 43:40.245
My time is limited.

43:41.287 --> 43:44.415
I feel it with every breath I draw.

43:44.416 --> 43:47.419
I need you to find a way forward...

43:47.877 --> 43:50.338
as Reverend Mothers.

44:03.768 --> 44:06.771
I'll be here, with you.

44:07.981 --> 44:09.607
You may kneel.

44:16.573 --> 44:19.450
Let Valya and I walk
amongst our foremothers.

44:19.451 --> 44:23.496
Give us the strength to return
and serve as Reverend Mothers.

44:27.500 --> 44:33.006
Valya Harkonnen, it is now time
to wake those who made you.

44:33.923 --> 44:37.344
It is an Agony, but only this once.

44:39.179 --> 44:40.888
Still your breath,

44:40.889 --> 44:42.890
focus your mind,

44:42.891 --> 44:45.435
and unlock your other memory.

44:51.524 --> 44:52.692
I'm sorry.

45:15.465 --> 45:17.509
Mother Raquella wants to see you.

45:30.021 --> 45:32.815
A message has come
from Lankiveil this morning

45:32.816 --> 45:34.983
from your sister, Tula.

45:34.984 --> 45:37.653
This phrase caught my eye:

45:37.654 --> 45:40.573
"The suet has been enjoyed by all.

45:41.366 --> 45:43.284
No more courses to serve."

45:46.329 --> 45:50.959
Felt like a code. Or maybe a confirmation?

45:52.252 --> 45:54.087
It means I have to go home.

45:55.005 --> 45:58.008
We can arrange that. You can leave today.

45:58.883 --> 46:00.093
Thank you.

46:02.095 --> 46:05.806
Your family name has always been
more important to you.

46:05.807 --> 46:09.184
That's why you couldn't
go through with the Agony test,

46:09.185 --> 46:13.023
because you have unfinished business
with your house.

46:13.982 --> 46:15.025
You knew.

46:15.817 --> 46:18.945
From the moment I saw you
that night in the rain.

46:20.864 --> 46:23.074
But I can't afford to be patient.

46:23.533 --> 46:27.077
Go back to Lankiveil,
settle what needs to be settled,

46:27.078 --> 46:29.622
but you must commit to a path.

46:30.040 --> 46:32.499
If you choose the Sisterhood,

46:32.500 --> 46:34.502
you must be willing to sacrifice.

46:37.255 --> 46:39.924
Return a Reverend Mother

46:40.342 --> 46:42.052
or not at all.

47:20.924 --> 47:22.133
Coward.

48:04.551 --> 48:06.302
I got your message.

48:08.013 --> 48:09.180
Is it done?

48:10.265 --> 48:12.225
Orry Atreides is dead?

48:14.644 --> 48:16.062
They all are.

48:29.284 --> 48:31.077
I didn't think you could.

48:32.370 --> 48:34.372
Neither did I.

48:38.376 --> 48:40.712
Griffin would be proud.

48:55.268 --> 48:56.936
Would he?

49:12.786 --> 49:16.206
Why did you bring her,
after what she made you do?

49:17.582 --> 49:19.124
She no longer has a place here.

49:19.125 --> 49:21.044
Why, she's my sister.

49:21.753 --> 49:23.421
It was my choice.

49:24.130 --> 49:25.548
You shouldn't have come back.

49:26.216 --> 49:27.842
You've done enough.

49:28.385 --> 49:32.263
That you have, you hateful girl.

49:32.639 --> 49:36.767
Did you even think how that massacre
will blow back at us?

49:36.768 --> 49:38.728
You should be thanking Tula.

49:39.312 --> 49:41.021
She did what none of you could.

49:41.022 --> 49:44.108
She punished the family
who destroyed ours,

49:44.109 --> 49:45.818
who killed Griffin.

49:45.819 --> 49:48.320
She showed them all that the Harkonnens
are not cowards.

49:48.321 --> 49:50.198
And what if they come after her?

49:51.741 --> 49:54.034
You were a sweet child
only trying to help.

49:54.035 --> 49:57.287
- She twisted you.
- She didn't do anything. I did.

49:57.288 --> 50:01.542
It's never enough, is it?
Your ambition, your rage.

50:01.543 --> 50:03.669
You've already cost us one child.

50:03.670 --> 50:05.588
- And now--
- <i>Be quiet!</i>

50:12.220 --> 50:13.930
<i>Pick up the knife.</i>

50:27.152 --> 50:29.029
What are you doing?

50:40.206 --> 50:41.458
Sorceress!

52:03.289 --> 52:05.582
<i>Valya, open your eyes.</i>

52:05.583 --> 52:07.794
<i>Please, wake up. Valya.</i>

52:09.379 --> 52:10.547
Valya?

52:15.135 --> 52:17.137
Wherever you are, come back.

52:18.263 --> 52:19.472
Please.

52:25.020 --> 52:26.021
Tula?

52:27.063 --> 52:30.025
Oh, you scared me. I thought...

52:30.525 --> 52:32.527
I heard your voice.

52:41.995 --> 52:43.371
What happened?

52:45.415 --> 52:47.083
The Agony.

52:48.168 --> 52:49.794
I survived.

52:52.380 --> 52:53.381
You alright?

52:54.424 --> 52:55.675
Yes.

52:59.596 --> 53:01.514
We should hurry.
We don't want to miss the ship.

53:02.599 --> 53:04.225
You're coming?

53:07.020 --> 53:08.396
I lost Griffin.

53:09.230 --> 53:10.648
I won't lose you too.

53:13.735 --> 53:14.736
Come on.

53:17.113 --> 53:18.281
But Valya,

53:20.909 --> 53:24.079
promise me the Sisterhood
will be a fresh start for us.

53:26.998 --> 53:29.417
We have a new purpose now.

54:07.539 --> 54:08.748
Sisters,

54:10.083 --> 54:14.504
it is time to say goodbye to Sister Lila.

54:18.299 --> 54:19.800
It's alright.

54:19.801 --> 54:21.593
Lila's wisdom still exists.

54:21.594 --> 54:24.389
- She's with her foremothers.
- It's not alright.

54:28.309 --> 54:33.272
You knew how desperate she was
to find out where she came from.

54:33.273 --> 54:35.232
You took advantage of that.

54:35.233 --> 54:38.403
She should never have been asked
to make this sacrifice.

54:39.571 --> 54:40.572
She was a child.

54:42.866 --> 54:45.160
This Order is founded on sacrifice.

54:46.202 --> 54:49.706
Many of your sisters,
some younger than Lila,

54:50.248 --> 54:53.668
have laid down their lives
in the service of our cause.

54:54.586 --> 54:58.297
They understood
that for some of us to advance,

54:58.298 --> 55:01.009
all of us must be willing to risk.

55:02.844 --> 55:04.554
Lila knew that.

55:05.722 --> 55:07.724
She played her part.

55:08.516 --> 55:10.309
Mother Valya would never
have asked her to try

55:10.310 --> 55:13.104
if she didn't believe
that it was necessary.

55:13.563 --> 55:16.024
We owe her our gratitude

55:16.983 --> 55:18.568
and our respect.

55:21.529 --> 55:23.406
And the same for Mother Tula.

55:30.038 --> 55:31.456
And now...

56:52.162 --> 56:53.787
Where are we going now?

56:53.788 --> 56:56.499
The last place anyone
would expect me to be.

57:14.726 --> 57:16.102
Who exactly are we meeting?

57:17.270 --> 57:19.689
Sacrifices must be made.

57:21.358 --> 57:23.360
Sisterhood above all.

57:34.496 --> 57:35.663
Aunt Valya.

57:40.293 --> 57:42.671
What an unexpected surprise.

57:52.639 --> 57:55.141
Never thought I'd live to see the day.

58:01.481 --> 58:02.691
Please,

58:03.400 --> 58:04.734
come in.

58:10.323 --> 58:11.533
Sister.

58:15.829 --> 58:19.165
How is Aunt Tula doing?

58:31.720 --> 58:33.722
I'm just going to put this
in the storeroom.

58:36.725 --> 58:38.351
Mother Tula,

58:39.769 --> 58:43.814
I know how difficult that was for you,
letting Lila go.

58:43.815 --> 58:46.735
I believe Mother Valya would be proud.

58:48.069 --> 58:49.070
Indeed.

59:48.463 --> 59:50.839
Anirul, run diagnostics.

59:50.840 --> 59:55.010
<i>Metabolic activity slowing,
blood pressure, 91.</i>

59:55.011 --> 59:58.682
<i>Pulse rate, 140.
Neural activity, irregular.</i>

59:59.724 --> 01:00:02.101
Spice can rejuvenate the mind.

01:00:02.102 --> 01:00:04.728
She still has a chance
if you administer the correct dosage.

01:00:04.729 --> 01:00:07.315
<i>This is not an authorized request.</i>

01:00:08.024 --> 01:00:10.067
Mother Valya is off planet.

01:00:10.068 --> 01:00:14.406
She entrusted me with the key.
I order you to keep this child alive.

01:00:14.739 --> 01:00:16.366
<i>Initiating protocol.</i>
