00:34.743 --> 00:39.998
What holds more truth,
history or prophecy?

00:43.335 --> 00:45.920
When humans rose up
against the thinking machines

00:46.004 --> 00:47.589
that had enslaved them,

00:51.301 --> 00:56.097
history says it was an Atreides
who led them to victory

01:00.393 --> 01:03.855
while my great-grandfather
deserted the fight.

01:09.235 --> 01:13.865
When war ended and all thinking machine
technology was banned,

01:15.033 --> 01:18.161
history branded my family as cowards.

01:19.120 --> 01:22.414
And so we were banished
to a desolate world.

01:30.548 --> 01:35.053
Others who shared my blood
were resigned to living in shame.

01:36.429 --> 01:41.309
But the history the Atreides wrote
was spun out of lies.

01:44.187 --> 01:48.400
And I, Valya Harkonnen,
would set out to change it.

02:01.871 --> 02:06.543
So I broke free from the past,
and chose a new family,

02:06.626 --> 02:10.005
made up of women unafraid of their power.

02:11.339 --> 02:15.844
There, I met my true mother,
the first Mother Superior,

02:15.927 --> 02:18.013
Raquella Berto-Anirul.

02:19.264 --> 02:20.765
A hero during the wars,

02:21.891 --> 02:24.686
she trained Sisters
to work as Truthsayers.

02:27.564 --> 02:32.110
Assigned to the Great Houses
to help them sift truth from lies.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.575
Together, they would form
a network of influence

02:38.658 --> 02:40.660
throughout the Imperium.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.164
Raquella would use it
to govern the future.

02:52.547 --> 02:54.799
But those who held power
were inherently driven

02:54.883 --> 02:56.634
by violence and greed.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.556
They required more than just guidance.

03:01.639 --> 03:03.850
They required transformation.

03:05.352 --> 03:08.146
Mother Raquella
embarked on a secret project.

03:10.857 --> 03:13.902
She wanted to breed better leaders.

03:15.403 --> 03:18.615
She amassed a vast genetic archive.

03:19.199 --> 03:22.994
She would use it to foster
the right royal unions

03:23.078 --> 03:26.081
and cultivate rulers we could control.

03:30.710 --> 03:35.340
Zealots among us would view this breeding
as heresy.

03:36.758 --> 03:40.345
But Mother Superior knew
I shared her vision.

03:42.972 --> 03:45.433
And I would stop at nothing
to carry it out.

03:48.853 --> 03:50.230
That is why

03:50.313 --> 03:53.024
in her final moments

03:53.108 --> 03:55.902
she called for me.

03:59.155 --> 04:00.407
Valya.

04:00.490 --> 04:03.243
It's me, Dorotea.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.537
Valya Harkonnen.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.075
Wait here, Tula.

04:57.047 --> 04:58.631
These prayers won't help her.

04:58.715 --> 04:59.799
What is she doing here?

05:03.470 --> 05:05.513
I'm here, Mother Superior.

05:08.391 --> 05:10.602
Red dust.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.105
Tell them to leave us now.

05:16.983 --> 05:18.818
Red-- Red...

05:26.368 --> 05:27.369
It's coming.

05:29.913 --> 05:32.624
Tiran-Arafel.

06:14.708 --> 06:16.126
Valya.

06:17.919 --> 06:22.549
Grow us, safeguard our power.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.510
Use every tool.

06:25.593 --> 06:31.266
The Sisterhood must be strengthened
or it will fall.

06:34.644 --> 06:38.815
You will be the one to see

06:38.898 --> 06:42.902
the burning truth and know.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.966
She warned us.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.677
-Tiran-Arafel.
-A reckoning.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.389
A holy judgment brought on by a tyrant.

07:11.473 --> 07:16.144
From what I saw in Raquella's eyes,
I believe one is coming for us.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.938
We have to prepare.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.023
How?

07:21.816 --> 07:24.152
By putting one of ours on the throne.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.450
A Sister?

07:32.952 --> 07:36.581
The first empress to rule the Imperium.

07:37.290 --> 07:40.335
-One loyal to us.
-Dorotea will never agree.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.420
She has to, Kasha.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.882
It is the only thing
that ensures our protection.

08:04.192 --> 08:09.072
Mother Raquella always said,
"We could not be split in our purpose."

08:15.662 --> 08:18.707
Factions in the Sisterhood
would only weaken our order.

08:25.463 --> 08:29.134
What she foresaw was a force
of unimaginable darkness

08:29.217 --> 08:31.386
that could destroy us completely.

08:39.309 --> 08:42.688
I had to convince my Sisters
of what was true.

08:45.859 --> 08:48.862
We must carry her legacy forward.

08:50.280 --> 08:54.659
We must keep pushing the boundaries
of what it means to be human.

08:56.244 --> 08:58.913
We must harness our powers of truthsense

08:58.997 --> 09:02.500
until we advise all
the Great Houses who govern.

09:02.584 --> 09:05.879
Mother Raquella urged us
to use every tool.

09:05.962 --> 09:10.050
Humility is the foundation of our virtues.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.969
Humility is the foundation of our virtues.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.430
The mind of man is holy.

09:15.513 --> 09:18.099
The mind of man is holy.

09:18.183 --> 09:20.727
Thou shall not disfigure the soul!

09:20.810 --> 09:24.022
Thou shall not disfigure the soul.

09:29.027 --> 09:33.031
Adversity always lies
in the path of advancement.

09:35.367 --> 09:36.701
Most would run from it.

09:37.494 --> 09:39.496
I would walk through it.

09:40.372 --> 09:43.958
That is why Mother Raquella
chose me to lead.

09:52.884 --> 09:55.553
I see you wasted no time stepping in.

09:59.974 --> 10:03.603
Mother Dorotea, what are you doing?

10:07.524 --> 10:10.151
What should've been done long ago.

10:21.121 --> 10:24.124
Why do you need access
to the breeding index?

10:28.753 --> 10:33.383
So I can return the Sisterhood
to its values.

10:37.053 --> 10:38.138
You can't do this!

10:38.221 --> 10:40.390
We are the hand that points
toward a righteous path.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.309
We are meant to guide the Imperium,
not rule it.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.770
We must create the path
and lead others to it.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.230
We are the only ones who can.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.691
Ever since you arrived,
you and your sister, Tula,

10:49.774 --> 10:52.193
you've thought too highly of yourself.

10:55.238 --> 10:57.949
You'd risk our destruction
to keep your principles pure.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.577
Mother Raquella didn't share your beliefs,

11:00.660 --> 11:03.455
nor do others aside from
your faction of zealots!

11:03.538 --> 11:06.541
You heard what she said.
You swore to use every tool!

11:06.624 --> 11:09.753
Because I did not want to fight with her
on her deathbed.

11:12.130 --> 11:14.466
This is no tool.

11:15.342 --> 11:17.552
This is us playing God.

11:18.887 --> 11:21.181
And we will be judged for it.

11:22.599 --> 11:24.517
I honor my grandmother

11:24.601 --> 11:28.271
but this great work of hers
must be destroyed.

11:30.106 --> 11:33.443
I beg of you, don't do this.
Dorotea!

11:35.445 --> 11:38.865
Stop!

11:41.618 --> 11:42.702
Face me!

11:49.125 --> 11:50.126
What?

11:52.003 --> 11:54.005
A new skill I've been honing.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.884
One I'd hoped to share with you.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.845
And I will

12:02.180 --> 12:03.807
if you bend.

12:07.519 --> 12:14.359
I will never bend to you,
Valya Harkonnen.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.656
Then take out your blade!

12:23.535 --> 12:25.453
Drive it into your throat!

12:48.977 --> 12:52.022
I knew then,
the name Valya Harkonnen

12:52.105 --> 12:56.109
would forever be damned
to the wrong side of history.

13:00.030 --> 13:03.116
But my truth lay in prophecy.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.743
What do we do?

13:07.120 --> 13:09.080
Sisterhood above all.

14:26.991 --> 14:31.579
House Varick and House Khumali
have put in requests for a Truthsayer.

14:33.456 --> 14:37.460
And House Harkonnen
has put in a fourth request.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.260
Mother Superior Valya?

14:47.387 --> 14:48.596
Yes to House Varick.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.599
Khumali will have to wait.

14:53.476 --> 14:58.648
And you can tell House Harkonnen no
for a fourth time.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.363
Excuse me, Sister Avila.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.048
Imperial guards.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.550
They're here for the princess.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.721
Her new husband must be quite a catch,
fleeing him so quickly.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.100
That's the princess's half-brother.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.272
He has no claim to the throne.

15:42.359 --> 15:45.403
A man with no purpose
devises only mischief.

15:45.904 --> 15:48.365
Exactly. Nothing I like more

15:48.448 --> 15:52.285
than a man with great wealth
and idle hands.

15:55.705 --> 15:58.415
Perhaps once his sister is here,
he'll pay us more visits.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.919
And one day, I'll be her Truthsayer
and sister-in-law.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.547
I think the whole point of her coming here
is to be her own Truthsayer.

16:13.515 --> 16:15.392
Come along, now. Quickly.

16:20.814 --> 16:23.817
We instruct many daughters
of the Great Houses,

16:23.900 --> 16:25.276
Lord Constantine.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.987
There will be no risk
to the princess here.

16:28.071 --> 16:32.117
None of those other daughters is the heir
to the Golden Lion Throne.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.786
If my sister's going to spend the next
10 years here,

16:34.869 --> 16:36.871
we need to take precautions.

16:37.247 --> 16:40.959
Also, the princess will
require her own quarters.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.379
Once your sister is here,

16:44.462 --> 16:47.090
she will be treated
as every other student.

16:47.716 --> 16:49.634
The dormitory is quite comfortable.

16:49.718 --> 16:51.428
That's not acceptable.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.557
Well, that is unfortunate.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.028
I had to try.

17:11.573 --> 17:12.906
Shall we?

17:31.760 --> 17:35.347
Humanity's greatest weapon is the lie.

17:36.306 --> 17:39.893
If you observe the large amount
of white matter

17:39.976 --> 17:44.272
in the prefrontal cortex,
do you know what that makes this man?

17:44.564 --> 17:46.358
-A criminal.
-A sociopath.

17:46.441 --> 17:47.525
A survivor.

17:47.609 --> 17:49.069
Yes, Sister Jen.

17:49.361 --> 17:52.822
Human beings rely on lies to survive.

17:52.906 --> 17:54.657
We lie to our enemies.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.744
We lie to our friends.

17:59.412 --> 18:01.414
We lie to ourselves.

18:02.040 --> 18:07.045
Lying is among the most sophisticated task
a brain can perform.

18:08.088 --> 18:12.425
Because, for most of us,
we don't like to lie.

18:12.509 --> 18:15.345
The body rejects it.

18:17.097 --> 18:19.641
-How does it do that?
-Pupils dilate.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.976
-Changes in breathing.
-Perspiration on the brow.

18:22.060 --> 18:27.273
Yes, that's right. All of them signs
that we work to perceive in Truthsaying.

18:27.357 --> 18:30.360
It's clear you have a grasp of theory,

18:30.443 --> 18:33.238
but application is what
distinguishes a Sister.

18:33.321 --> 18:35.865
Tomorrow, you will be tested
on your progress.

18:36.199 --> 18:39.494
I suggest you get some rest today.
Class is dismissed.

18:48.503 --> 18:50.338
Good news, little sister.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.924
So it went well?

18:53.383 --> 18:56.011
This time next week, she'll be ours.

19:46.561 --> 19:47.979
You almost had me that time.

19:48.563 --> 19:49.773
I did not.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.574
Focus on the body, not the blade.

19:59.908 --> 20:03.119
Your eyes, they can lie, but this...

20:04.579 --> 20:06.164
this'll tell you where
your opponent's headin'

20:06.247 --> 20:07.791
even before they know.

20:09.584 --> 20:12.587
Unhand the princess! Filthy scum.

20:13.046 --> 20:15.340
Constantine, you made it!

20:15.423 --> 20:16.716
How could I have missed you tying the knot

20:16.800 --> 20:18.843
to a boy just out of diapers?

20:23.139 --> 20:24.140
Keiran.

20:25.934 --> 20:28.978
Between your sword master training
and the Sisterhood,

20:29.062 --> 20:31.106
I'm worried Nezzy will grow
too full of herself to bear.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.359
She has become quite good.

20:34.442 --> 20:36.361
She'll acquit herself well on Wallach IX.

20:38.279 --> 20:40.115
How was the Sisterhood?

20:40.615 --> 20:43.493
Well, if you like barren landscapes
and minimalism,

20:43.576 --> 20:44.786
you'll be very happy.

20:49.624 --> 20:51.334
-Princess.
-You wanna see?

21:01.803 --> 21:04.014
As a royal wedding present,

21:04.097 --> 21:06.474
House of Richese
gives the House of Corrino

21:06.558 --> 21:09.519
a newly built fleet
of ballista motherships.

21:11.146 --> 21:14.899
Emperor Corrino has reviewed
House Richese's proposal

21:14.983 --> 21:17.610
and finds the terms to be acceptable.

21:18.236 --> 21:21.364
A fleet that will know no equal.

21:22.198 --> 21:24.117
Dust storms won't hinder it.

21:24.659 --> 21:27.579
Fremen don't stand a chance against it.

21:27.662 --> 21:31.166
Your issues on Arrakis
will be a thing of the past,

21:31.249 --> 21:33.460
and spice will flow.

21:35.295 --> 21:39.382
One more thing, it occurred to me
that having our own wing

21:39.466 --> 21:42.302
in the palace might smooth the transition.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.138
That wasn't part of the arrangement.

21:45.221 --> 21:47.390
Your Majesty, I'm sorry to be frank,

21:47.474 --> 21:51.061
but your issues on Arrakis
aren't going away.

21:51.144 --> 21:55.190
Not without my ships to protect
the harvest from Fremen attacks.

21:56.608 --> 22:00.945
It is in my blood to build,
and I do it spectacularly well.

22:02.822 --> 22:06.910
Your admirals know
Richese ships are superior to all others.

22:08.495 --> 22:11.623
Just last month, I heard you lost
another excavator and a whole regiment.

22:13.958 --> 22:19.339
Would you let this small ask derail
our entire agreement?

22:31.726 --> 22:33.561
He's trying to make a fool of me.

22:56.251 --> 22:57.919
Very well. You have a deal.

22:59.087 --> 23:00.505
Excellent!

23:02.007 --> 23:04.217
See you at the engagement ceremony.

23:09.097 --> 23:12.267
You wish to serve the Great Houses
as Truthsayers

23:12.350 --> 23:14.436
and shape the flow of power.

23:14.519 --> 23:18.148
You must first exert power over yourself.

23:19.357 --> 23:23.111
Your mind and body must be
within your control.

23:24.988 --> 23:27.365
Only then, can you discern the truth.

23:32.078 --> 23:35.790
In front of you are men and women
from the Imperial prison.

23:36.166 --> 23:38.960
Thieves, swindlers, con artists.

23:39.044 --> 23:41.671
Your task is to demonstrate,
at the least,

23:41.755 --> 23:43.673
a rudimentary command of Truthsaying.

23:43.757 --> 23:46.009
We have removed all barriers
to your subjects

23:46.092 --> 23:47.886
to make this task easier.

23:47.969 --> 23:48.970
You may begin.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.067
Ain't you a pretty little thing.

24:32.222 --> 24:35.975
Her words are true,
but her intent is to deceive.

24:36.309 --> 24:39.479
He lies. This man is a liar.

24:39.854 --> 24:42.273
Honestly, these were the best
you could find?

24:47.529 --> 24:53.368
If you think it's so simple to deceive,
Sister, tell us, why are you here?

24:54.744 --> 24:55.954
My story.

24:56.746 --> 24:58.498
When I was a child,

24:59.165 --> 25:01.251
my mother and father sold me to a man
who made his money

25:01.334 --> 25:03.086
peddling the flesh of children.

25:04.754 --> 25:06.756
I'll spare you the details.

25:07.257 --> 25:11.845
But I bided my time until he got sloppy
with his knives.

25:14.305 --> 25:16.141
I slit his throat in his sleep.

25:18.560 --> 25:20.020
Then I went home

25:22.188 --> 25:23.523
and did the same to my parents.

25:30.071 --> 25:31.906
The looks on your faces.

25:51.676 --> 25:53.762
This is my tradition.

25:54.512 --> 25:56.931
I wore this when I first met your father.

25:57.390 --> 25:59.059
He was a stranger to me too.

26:02.020 --> 26:04.022
The veil belonged to my mother.

26:04.481 --> 26:06.691
Made by the Wanderers of Harmonthep.

26:07.359 --> 26:08.693
Very understated.

26:09.319 --> 26:11.321
It's a symbol of strength.

26:14.074 --> 26:16.910
Something I wish you'd show
a little more of.

26:18.411 --> 26:22.665
Instead of allowing those sorceresses
to woo you to their school.

26:24.626 --> 26:28.129
The Sisterhood will teach me skills
that will aid in my leadership.

26:28.213 --> 26:31.132
-This arrangement isn't what I wanted.
-Why not?

26:31.966 --> 26:33.885
I hear Pruwet Richese's quite charming.

26:33.968 --> 26:35.387
The boy is nine.

26:35.470 --> 26:39.557
Every year before he comes of age
is mine to do with what I will.

26:39.641 --> 26:41.601
I'd make him younger, if I could.

26:41.685 --> 26:42.852
If you took my counsel,

26:42.936 --> 26:45.188
you'd rule how you want
and marry who you want.

26:51.152 --> 26:54.114
I see the way you look
at our new Swordmaster.

26:56.032 --> 26:58.243
I'm getting what I want.

27:01.538 --> 27:04.749
You're not the only one
who knows how to negotiate.

27:25.770 --> 27:27.689
I'm surrounded by vipers, Kasha.

27:28.189 --> 27:30.316
And Duke Richese's the worst of them all.

27:30.400 --> 27:32.277
The Duke is no viper.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.112
He's simply a man.

27:34.195 --> 27:36.489
Your Majesty, Reverend Mother Kasha.

27:36.573 --> 27:37.991
Swordmaster.

27:38.616 --> 27:40.994
-What is it, Keiran?
-There's a soldier here from Arrakis.

27:41.077 --> 27:42.579
Can't you deal with it?

27:42.662 --> 27:44.456
It's Desmond Hart, sir.

27:44.539 --> 27:46.124
He survived.

28:03.141 --> 28:04.392
Desmond Hart.

28:06.561 --> 28:09.064
-Your Majesty.
-It's an honor.

28:09.773 --> 28:13.610
Twelve tours of Arrakis
when few last more than one.

28:14.110 --> 28:16.112
Multiple commendations.

28:17.113 --> 28:21.117
We heard your regiment was wiped out
in a Fremen attack.

28:22.077 --> 28:24.746
Harvester, transports, everything.

28:24.829 --> 28:26.873
That is why I've come.

28:28.833 --> 28:31.503
Because I'm the only one
that can tell you the truth.

28:35.090 --> 28:36.549
The attack on Arrakis,

28:37.676 --> 28:39.010
it wasn't Fremen.

28:40.720 --> 28:42.972
They were insurgents
from your own allied worlds.

28:43.056 --> 28:45.767
The equipment they used
was from off-planet

28:45.850 --> 28:48.311
and they were trained in our ways.

28:48.978 --> 28:51.898
Once our harvester ejected
its payload of spice,

28:51.981 --> 28:54.234
their ship collected it.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.361
It was theft.

29:01.741 --> 29:02.867
Kasha.

29:05.870 --> 29:08.081
His story is true, Your Majesty.

29:08.873 --> 29:11.084
Or at least he believes it to be.

29:12.961 --> 29:14.838
Then why wasn't I informed?

29:14.921 --> 29:16.464
It must be an isolated incident.

29:22.762 --> 29:25.056
You've been long on Arrakis.

29:25.140 --> 29:27.267
I imagine you're eager for some leave.

29:29.561 --> 29:32.439
Actually, Your Majesty, I was hoping

29:33.314 --> 29:35.567
that I could get an assignment here
at the palace.

29:36.276 --> 29:38.445
Well, I'm sure we can find
something suitable

29:38.528 --> 29:40.071
for a man of your talents.

29:41.573 --> 29:45.201
In the meantime,
we're about to have quite a party.

29:47.412 --> 29:48.663
Join us.

30:31.498 --> 30:32.832
Nez!

30:34.376 --> 30:36.086
You did this!

30:46.471 --> 30:47.472
Nez!

31:12.330 --> 31:13.915
I came to say goodbye.

31:14.541 --> 31:17.127
Kasha, what's wrong?

31:24.676 --> 31:27.804
Remember the day my Sisters and I
found you?

31:29.097 --> 31:32.517
We had no way of knowing
what we would discover.

31:33.685 --> 31:36.771
A child held captive for years.

31:37.731 --> 31:42.902
But the moment I saw you,
I knew that one day

31:43.903 --> 31:48.700
you would lead our Imperium
to a better future.

31:50.285 --> 31:53.705
I have something I need to attend to,
but I'll be back soon.

32:40.627 --> 32:43.296
Kasha's gonna miss
the engagement ceremony

32:43.380 --> 32:45.256
but she says she'll be back
for the wedding.

32:45.340 --> 32:46.675
Oh, thank the stars.

32:46.758 --> 32:48.968
What would we possibly do without her?

32:49.052 --> 32:51.388
Look, I know you're angry with me
about this wedding.

32:52.806 --> 32:54.641
What choice do I have?

32:55.392 --> 32:57.477
Our marriage may have joined the Imperium.

32:57.560 --> 32:59.896
-It didn't cement it.
-Stop parroting her words back at me.

32:59.979 --> 33:02.190
I know exactly what our marriage did,
I brokered it.

33:03.274 --> 33:05.235
I'm telling you,
they chose that boy knowing his age

33:05.318 --> 33:07.904
would give them years to make Nez
one of their own.

33:08.488 --> 33:10.907
Stop fighting this wedding, Natalya.

33:12.200 --> 33:16.079
That boy comes with a fleet of fighters,
which I need for Arrakis.

33:20.709 --> 33:23.878
There was a time when you took
my views seriously.

33:25.839 --> 33:28.174
The Imperium was the stronger for it.

33:29.551 --> 33:31.386
Yes, well, you and I,

33:33.972 --> 33:35.974
we remember things differently.

33:43.857 --> 33:45.859
Need to get dressed.

33:48.153 --> 33:49.195
It's time.

34:00.749 --> 34:03.293
Emeline performed well.

34:03.376 --> 34:07.505
And it might be wise to pair the princess
with someone outside royal circles.

34:08.089 --> 34:09.299
Next.

34:10.884 --> 34:14.262
Not everyone from this school
stems from noble houses.

34:14.346 --> 34:16.222
It's not her background that concerns me.

34:16.306 --> 34:18.391
She's too rigid. She reeks of piety.

34:18.475 --> 34:21.478
We operate across worlds
of all dispositions.

34:21.561 --> 34:24.313
Our aim is not to broaden
the princess's worldview.

34:24.397 --> 34:26.858
It's to adhere her to our own.

34:28.360 --> 34:29.902
The Sisterhood's, you mean.

34:34.199 --> 34:36.618
Acolyte bonds are forged in fire.

34:37.034 --> 34:39.036
They last a lifetime.

34:39.579 --> 34:41.331
Emeline is a bad influence.

34:42.331 --> 34:44.542
Jen has bite, doesn't she?

34:49.547 --> 34:52.509
She'll go far if she can be tamed.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.471
Reminds me of someone else I know.

34:57.013 --> 34:59.599
-When was I ever tamed?
-Never,

34:59.683 --> 35:01.434
if you asked our mother.

35:05.438 --> 35:08.942
Well, I think the princess
would like her, but

35:09.025 --> 35:10.902
she's too independent a thinker.

35:12.153 --> 35:16.032
We need to pair Ynez with someone
we can trust to keep her in line.

35:16.533 --> 35:18.993
She won't be under
Kasha's influence much longer.

35:19.077 --> 35:20.704
Well, Theodosia?

35:22.580 --> 35:24.582
She has reason to be loyal to us.

35:25.583 --> 35:28.628
We took her in when she had
nowhere else to turn.

35:28.712 --> 35:30.338
She excels in her studies.

35:30.422 --> 35:31.798
She is uniquely

35:32.924 --> 35:34.134
useful.

35:35.010 --> 35:36.428
We'll see.

35:37.387 --> 35:38.722
Oh, don't dissemble, sister.

35:38.805 --> 35:40.765
You're only hard on her
because she's your favorite.

35:42.308 --> 35:45.645
Well, your favorite's like a lamb lost
in the woods.

35:52.527 --> 35:54.529
Lila is a true empath.

35:55.697 --> 35:57.699
And given her lineage,

35:58.324 --> 36:00.827
she will be a natural-born Truthsayer.

36:02.620 --> 36:04.497
She needs to be nurtured.

36:04.581 --> 36:07.417
Weakness is not something to nurture.

36:08.585 --> 36:12.255
She's young. She's afraid.
She's in awe of you.

36:12.339 --> 36:15.216
And in time,
she'll grow all those hard layers

36:15.300 --> 36:17.302
that you measure worth by,

36:18.762 --> 36:19.763
as I did.

36:21.181 --> 36:24.017
Don't underestimate yourself, Tula.

36:24.893 --> 36:28.521
What matters most is what's underneath
those hard layers.

37:11.189 --> 37:14.484
-Whatever trepidation you're feeling--
-It's not trepidation.

37:14.567 --> 37:16.611
What I saw was no ordinary nightmare.

37:17.529 --> 37:20.782
The fear I felt I still feel.

37:24.369 --> 37:26.121
You don't know Nez like I do.

37:27.622 --> 37:30.792
She's strong, not easily handled.

37:30.875 --> 37:33.670
Well, good. That's why she was chosen.

37:33.753 --> 37:38.049
You forget I'm the one who bonded with her
since she was a child,

37:38.133 --> 37:40.427
who deflects the empress's interference,

37:40.510 --> 37:43.972
who assuages the emperor's fears
even as we weaken him on Arrakis.

37:45.140 --> 37:48.435
Now is not the time
to lose faith in a plan

37:48.518 --> 37:50.562
that has been decades in the making.

37:50.645 --> 37:56.317
And what if this plan of yours
causes the very thing we seek to prevent?

37:57.277 --> 38:00.321
What if we've brought on the reckoning
Raquella spoke of?

38:00.405 --> 38:03.908
You forget I'm the one
that Raquella asked for

38:03.992 --> 38:05.452
as she lay dying.

38:06.202 --> 38:08.538
I shall see the burning truth.

38:09.039 --> 38:11.207
I think I know what she wanted.

38:17.881 --> 38:22.427
Why don't you stay the night,
remind yourself of your purpose,

38:22.510 --> 38:25.805
but tomorrow you must return
to Salusa Secundus.

38:25.889 --> 38:28.266
Nothing is more important
than your work there.

38:28.350 --> 38:31.478
A Sister on the throne,
that's what we agreed.

38:33.229 --> 38:36.066
And this is the marriage
that makes it possible.

38:40.320 --> 38:42.072
This wedding will proceed.

38:49.162 --> 38:51.539
House Richese.

39:26.032 --> 39:27.867
Your Majesty,

39:28.785 --> 39:35.250
may I present to you my son
and the future of your royal line,

39:35.333 --> 39:38.503
Lord Pruwet Richese.

39:41.840 --> 39:47.429
May the Richese seed find purchase
in royal wombs.

40:23.631 --> 40:25.633
If Kasha believes something is wrong,

40:25.717 --> 40:28.094
the least we can do is our due diligence.

40:28.845 --> 40:32.057
-Why do you dismiss her out of hand?
-It wasn't out of hand.

40:32.807 --> 40:34.642
I heard what she said

40:35.143 --> 40:36.728
and then I dismissed her.

40:38.980 --> 40:41.107
So, it is blind obedience you want?

40:41.816 --> 40:44.819
-Yes.
-Well, at least that's constant.

40:44.903 --> 40:47.906
I have done everything
that Raquella asked.

40:47.989 --> 40:50.784
I have protected our work.
I have grown our ranks.

40:50.867 --> 40:53.870
Our hands are poised
on the levers of power.

40:53.953 --> 40:56.581
And yet our grasp on it is still fragile.

40:57.374 --> 41:02.712
I am trying to protect us and the Imperium
the only way I know how.

41:02.796 --> 41:06.216
I believe in your commitment, Valya.

41:13.056 --> 41:15.266
Well, maybe she's grown too close to Ynez.

41:16.101 --> 41:18.061
It's so unlike her to abandon her post

41:18.144 --> 41:20.980
-at this precarious time.
-That is exactly my point.

41:21.564 --> 41:23.775
Why not just check the match.

41:25.110 --> 41:29.531
See if Princess Ynez truly is the one
we should put all our hopes in.

41:40.208 --> 41:41.668
My family calls me Nez.

41:43.169 --> 41:44.337
What do they call you?

41:45.130 --> 41:47.132
-Pruwet.
-So, what do you--

41:47.215 --> 41:48.883
We don't actually have to speak.

41:48.967 --> 41:51.261
Father says this is just a formality.

42:32.385 --> 42:33.762
Yeah.

43:02.665 --> 43:06.294
Whale fur,
the finest in the known universe.

43:07.128 --> 43:11.549
The profit is there.
It's simple mathematics really.

43:11.633 --> 43:14.135
I'm sure you're right, Baron Harkonnen.
Let me think about it.

43:14.219 --> 43:16.054
You won't regret it.

43:16.346 --> 43:19.516
And, whale fur never goes out of style.

43:19.599 --> 43:21.893
It would be incredible for your uniform.

43:23.061 --> 43:27.691
And have we discussed
the untouched value of whale seed?

43:27.774 --> 43:29.150
Its medicinal benefits--

43:29.234 --> 43:31.444
Would you excuse me a moment, please?

43:45.208 --> 43:46.418
What do you have there?

43:47.627 --> 43:48.920
Nothing.

43:54.592 --> 43:56.511
Your intent is to deceive.

43:56.594 --> 43:58.138
You're not a Truthsayer.

43:58.221 --> 44:01.266
Not yet, but I know a liar when I see one.

44:07.522 --> 44:08.857
Let me see.

44:51.691 --> 44:54.694
That technology is forbidden!

44:56.738 --> 44:58.365
Princess Ynez, step aside.

45:03.495 --> 45:05.747
Don't tell me you're all afraid
of a little toy?

45:05.830 --> 45:06.831
Afraid?

45:07.957 --> 45:11.795
You exist because House Corrino
defeated thinking machines!

45:15.840 --> 45:16.966
Javicco...

45:18.259 --> 45:20.178
let's be sensible.

45:20.929 --> 45:23.932
Don't let this ruin our celebration.

45:34.275 --> 45:36.611
Let us, for now,

45:38.363 --> 45:40.490
overlook this transgression.

46:15.859 --> 46:17.068
Thank you, Nez.

46:18.987 --> 46:21.156
Once our marriage goes through,

46:21.239 --> 46:25.076
you pull something like that again
and I'll stab you myself, you little shit.

46:25.160 --> 46:27.370
Now get rid of that thing.

46:43.011 --> 46:44.929
Our plan holds.

46:45.013 --> 46:48.391
I checked the genetic archive.
Ynez is the right choice.

46:48.850 --> 46:52.520
And this is the match that stabilizes
the Corrino line for centuries.

46:53.396 --> 46:55.440
I'm wondering if when all this is over,

46:55.523 --> 46:59.569
Kasha shouldn't spend some time here,
with us, on Wallach IX.

47:01.404 --> 47:04.282
Kasha may be wrong about the wedding,
but no one is closer to the emperor.

47:04.366 --> 47:06.201
We need her influence.

47:07.285 --> 47:09.704
You can't keep picking
pieces off the board

47:09.788 --> 47:11.664
just because they disagree with you.

47:13.208 --> 47:17.170
If you want to protect her, Tula,
get her head straight.

47:35.855 --> 47:37.482
After all our training,

47:37.565 --> 47:40.360
the princess will just stroll in here
as an acolyte.

47:40.443 --> 47:41.820
How's that fair?

47:41.903 --> 47:44.906
She's a princess. She's never known fair.

47:57.544 --> 47:59.212
We just passed the Lowers.

48:00.255 --> 48:02.674
We're not going to the Lowers.

48:03.675 --> 48:05.427
We're going to Division.

48:05.510 --> 48:08.680
One last night out. You and me.

48:09.347 --> 48:11.182
In that case...

48:49.679 --> 48:51.431
Your Majesty.

48:53.308 --> 48:54.809
Are you alright?

48:55.935 --> 48:57.937
Yes, yes. It's nothing.

49:02.984 --> 49:05.236
Fear can be debilitating.

49:07.322 --> 49:11.242
Especially on a planet like Arrakis,
where everything is

49:11.326 --> 49:13.620
constantly trying to kill you.

49:16.956 --> 49:19.292
You'll find Salusa Secundus familiar.

49:21.628 --> 49:23.046
No, thank you.

49:24.381 --> 49:25.965
What do you think?
You think a fleet of fighters

49:26.049 --> 49:28.677
will be enough to end
my troubles on Arrakis?

49:30.220 --> 49:31.221
Yes.

49:33.098 --> 49:36.851
But they'll do nothing about
the growing insurgency in the Imperium.

49:37.227 --> 49:39.437
That was an isolated incident.

49:41.773 --> 49:44.776
Your Majesty, the theft of spice
is a mere symptom.

49:46.611 --> 49:50.073
Your troubles are far greater
than just Arrakis.

49:58.164 --> 49:59.749
More and more people question

49:59.833 --> 50:02.460
if we were too quick
to discard the machines.

50:03.545 --> 50:07.007
And why only the Great Houses
profit from spice?

50:09.300 --> 50:11.302
Has this not been shared with you?

50:12.178 --> 50:15.015
I thought the witches knew
everything that went on.

50:20.061 --> 50:22.272
Kasha's never led me astray.

50:24.649 --> 50:28.069
But I feel this wedding is wrong.

50:28.987 --> 50:32.323
-Then call it off.
-And lose control of Arrakis?

50:35.452 --> 50:39.497
My father never suffered such humiliation.
Nor his father before him.

50:39.998 --> 50:44.002
Without spice, the Great Houses
would feed me to the worm.

50:45.879 --> 50:51.426
Do you believe in forces
that extend beyond man and machine?

50:52.927 --> 50:55.138
I don't know what I believe anymore.

50:57.390 --> 50:59.392
Well, then believe this.

51:00.810 --> 51:02.812
I should not be here.

51:03.313 --> 51:05.523
That attack should've killed me.

51:06.024 --> 51:09.027
The fear I felt staring down
in that abyss.

51:13.156 --> 51:15.158
You know what I prayed for then?

51:17.535 --> 51:18.703
The strength

51:19.496 --> 51:22.374
to feel nothing.

51:24.459 --> 51:27.420
Next thing I know,
I'm clawing my way out of the sand.

51:27.504 --> 51:31.007
My lungs are screaming.
And when I took my first breath...

51:33.301 --> 51:34.969
I felt reborn.

51:36.012 --> 51:40.100
Different, I was no longer afraid.

51:45.021 --> 51:47.023
The gods are listening.

51:48.566 --> 51:49.901
The gods?

51:54.698 --> 51:56.908
Religion is my wife's refuge.

52:01.162 --> 52:03.164
I'll tell you something,

52:03.707 --> 52:06.918
if the gods freed me from
this vice of a wedding,

52:07.919 --> 52:09.796
consider me a true believer.

53:27.123 --> 53:28.333
Wanna share?

53:29.167 --> 53:30.377
Atreides,

53:31.628 --> 53:33.046
everything okay?

53:34.089 --> 53:35.507
We're good.

53:39.511 --> 53:40.845
Are we good?

53:44.349 --> 53:45.558
We're good.

54:48.246 --> 54:50.665
In two days' time,
I'll be in another world.

55:37.504 --> 55:40.465
What's wrong? Bad dreams?

55:40.548 --> 55:42.550
Everything's a joke to you.

55:44.969 --> 55:46.554
Why are you even here?

55:53.019 --> 55:55.230
Your story was a lie.

55:56.398 --> 55:58.274
But there was truth behind it.

56:00.652 --> 56:02.070
I was raised here,

56:02.946 --> 56:04.489
in the Sisterhood.

56:05.949 --> 56:09.661
The Reverend Mothers, they don't always
know who our parents are.

56:10.495 --> 56:12.455
And even if they do, they don't tell us.

56:18.044 --> 56:19.671
Don't worry, doe eyes,

56:21.214 --> 56:24.384
one way or another,
our past always finds us.

58:27.465 --> 58:30.885
You're okay, I promise. I'm here now.

58:39.978 --> 58:41.187
There you are.

58:50.196 --> 58:52.615
What are you doing out here all alone?

58:54.075 --> 58:57.287
I couldn't sleep. I had a bad dream.

59:07.881 --> 59:09.299
You wanna tell me about it?

59:12.844 --> 59:17.015
I'd be afraid too,
after what happened to your toy.

59:22.520 --> 59:25.315
Father says we've become far too strict
about such things.

59:29.736 --> 59:30.904
You're a real soldier?

59:31.988 --> 59:33.406
Then why are you here?

59:34.949 --> 59:38.661
-There's no war here.
-Not many see it, but I do.

59:38.745 --> 59:41.873
There's a war hidden in plain sight,

59:42.499 --> 59:46.920
waged by an enemy
that has made themselves indispensable.

59:47.754 --> 59:50.340
It has come here
to do our thinking for us.

59:50.423 --> 59:52.759
But the machine wars ended ages ago.

59:52.842 --> 59:55.053
They did, I know.

59:55.470 --> 01:00:00.433
And that is why it is so troubling
that we are being controlled again.

01:00:31.381 --> 01:00:34.592
That is why I've been gifted
a great power.

01:00:35.885 --> 01:00:37.637
What power do you mean?

01:00:38.596 --> 01:00:41.808
To win a war requires sacrifice.

01:00:43.810 --> 01:00:47.188
And yours, it won't be in vain.

01:00:59.075 --> 01:01:02.454
Stop it, please! It hurts! Stop!

01:01:08.752 --> 01:01:10.378
Stop it, please!

01:01:13.882 --> 01:01:14.883
No!

01:02:56.526 --> 01:02:58.153
I see, Mother.

01:02:58.820 --> 01:03:00.030
I see.
