15:03.194 --> 15:04.571

15:04.613 --> 15:06.281
Did you solve it?

15:06.323 --> 15:08.158
[chuckles] No, there's
so many competing theories.

15:08.199 --> 15:09.451
For starters, there's a theory

15:09.492 --> 15:11.703
that if they didn't
become grownups,

15:11.745 --> 15:13.872
kid dinosaurs were probably
eaten by predators.

15:13.913 --> 15:16.291
So, there'd be no
fossils left to find.

15:16.333 --> 15:17.917
Maybe you don't
wanna be a dinosaur.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.961
[giggling]

15:20.003 --> 15:21.671
There's also the idea
that paleontologists used

15:21.713 --> 15:23.506
to only care about
finding the big dinosaurs.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.383
So, they left all
the little fossils behind.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.761
But my favorite theory is
that fossils that belonged

15:27.802 --> 15:29.971
to different dinosaurs
might actually belong

15:30.013 --> 15:32.390
to the same dinosaur,
just at different ages.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.600
Wouldn't
paleontologists notice

15:33.642 --> 15:35.977
that the two fossils
look the same?

15:36.019 --> 15:37.646
Not necessarily.

15:37.687 --> 15:39.648
Paleontologists love to
find things and name them.

15:39.689 --> 15:41.983
Everybody wants to discover
a brand new dinosaur.

15:42.025 --> 15:43.652
I know I do!

15:43.693 --> 15:45.153
Me too, but if you only
look at what's different

15:45.195 --> 15:46.404
between two fossils.

15:46.446 --> 15:47.864
Or two brothers.

15:47.906 --> 15:49.532
You might not
realize they're family.

15:49.574 --> 15:51.159
But if that's true,

15:51.201 --> 15:54.454
that means some dinosaurs
wouldn't exist anymore.

15:54.496 --> 15:56.122
Exactly.

15:56.164 --> 15:57.999
Some paleontologists think
that we could lose dozens.

15:58.041 --> 16:00.794
Every dinosaur book
would have to be rewritten.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.045

16:06.549 --> 16:08.218
Hmm.
How do we solve it?

16:08.259 --> 16:09.761
One way would be
to get dinosaurs

16:09.803 --> 16:11.346

family group together

16:11.388 --> 16:12.889

16:12.931 --> 16:15.141
If they try to kill each other,
they're probably not related.

16:15.183 --> 16:19.145
But if they don't, they
can be the same dinosaur!

16:19.187 --> 16:20.522

25:53.594 --> 25:54.929

I don't believe it!

25:59.475 --> 26:03.187
[squawking and chirping]

26:04.897 --> 26:06.732
Pterosaurs too?

[screeching]

26:09.527 --> 26:12.905
[chirping and squawking]

26:12.947 --> 26:14.991
Is that a T-Rex?

26:29.463 --> 26:33.009

[roars]

26:53.487 --> 26:54.864
Tyrannosaurus rex!

26:56.240 --> 26:57.491
You're my favorite dinosaur!

26:59.201 --> 27:02.872
[grumbles]

27:04.206 --> 27:05.124
Hello.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.461
[growling]

27:08.502 --> 27:09.962
My name's Mateo.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.257
Do you wanna see something?

27:13.299 --> 27:15.593
[growls]

27:15.634 --> 27:18.220
That's you.
Isn't that cool?

27:20.473 --> 27:22.266
[laughing]

27:22.308 --> 27:25.436
Don't move, Mateo.

27:25.478 --> 27:27.188
Hi, Dana.
Look what I found.

27:29.690 --> 27:32.234
[nervously laughing]
Come over to me.

27:32.276 --> 27:34.445
It's okay, he's friendly.

27:34.487 --> 27:36.030
Aren't you T-Rex?

27:37.448 --> 27:40.493
He is a she
and I think she thinks

27:40.534 --> 27:42.495
you're one of her babies.

27:42.536 --> 27:43.579
Do you?

27:43.621 --> 27:44.789
[grunting]

27:44.830 --> 27:45.956
She does!

27:45.998 --> 27:48.042
Hi, mama T-Rex!

27:48.084 --> 27:49.668
[growls]

27:49.710 --> 27:53.839
Yup, big dangerous mama T-Rex,
now, come on, over here!

27:55.257 --> 27:57.176
Your backpack is magical.

28:00.805 --> 28:04.225
[roars]

28:04.266 --> 28:06.143
A spinosaurus.

28:06.185 --> 28:08.104
Is that one a boy or a girl?

28:08.145 --> 28:10.356
It doesn't matter, run!

28:10.398 --> 28:12.400
[roars]

28:12.441 --> 28:16.195
[both roaring]

28:17.780 --> 28:19.031
Whoa!

28:19.073 --> 28:20.282
[Dana]
Mateo!

28:20.324 --> 28:21.742
Whee!

28:23.702 --> 28:25.162
[Dana]
Mateo!

28:25.204 --> 28:26.372
-Stay calm.
-The spino is falling over!

28:26.414 --> 28:27.706
[screaming]

28:27.748 --> 28:29.083
Dana?

28:29.125 --> 28:30.126
Are you okay?

28:31.794 --> 28:33.671
Don't worry, I'm okay!

28:33.712 --> 28:35.339
I'm not.

28:35.381 --> 28:36.882
Help!

28:36.924 --> 28:38.634
I'm coming, Mateo!

28:38.676 --> 28:40.261
[Mateo]
Dana! Ah!

28:40.302 --> 28:41.804
Stop drooling on me!

28:41.846 --> 28:43.514
[spinosaurus grunting]

28:43.556 --> 28:44.765
Help!

28:44.807 --> 28:46.976
[Dana]
I'm coming, Mateo!

28:47.017 --> 28:48.519
[nervous whining]

28:48.561 --> 28:50.729
[roars]

28:50.771 --> 28:51.981
[gasping]

28:53.816 --> 28:54.900
My bike.

28:55.985 --> 28:57.570
[roars]

28:57.611 --> 28:59.405
[Mateo]
The spino is coming too! Help!

29:12.710 --> 29:13.794
Hey!

29:15.838 --> 29:16.964
Give me back my bike.

29:17.006 --> 29:18.507
[Dana]
Just borrowing it!

29:23.053 --> 29:24.930
Hey! Get back here.

29:36.108 --> 29:38.319
This has been fun

29:38.360 --> 29:41.739
but mama T-Rex,
do you wanna put me down now?

29:43.532 --> 29:46.452
[roars]

29:46.494 --> 29:48.037
Actually, nevermind.

29:48.078 --> 29:49.246
Don't put me down,
don't put me down!

29:51.373 --> 29:55.294
Let's go!
Come on, faster, faster!

29:57.379 --> 29:58.714
[roars]

29:58.756 --> 30:00.508
Faster, mama T-Rex!

30:00.549 --> 30:02.635
Whoa, whoa!
Dana's book.

30:04.178 --> 30:05.262
Ah!

30:06.764 --> 30:08.140
He's gaining on us!

30:08.182 --> 30:09.558
Faster, mama T-Rex!

30:10.851 --> 30:13.395
[roars]

30:21.445 --> 30:22.988
-Stop!
-Mateo!

30:25.741 --> 30:27.701
[Dana]
My field guide.

30:27.743 --> 30:30.454
[Jadiel panting]

30:32.248 --> 30:34.959
Whoa, he must've come this way.

30:36.585 --> 30:38.671
You stole my bike.

30:38.712 --> 30:39.713
I borrowed it.

30:39.755 --> 30:41.131
Give it back.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.092
I can't, I'm using it
to find your brother.

30:43.133 --> 30:44.885
-Step-brother.
-Does it matter?

30:44.927 --> 30:46.262
He's in trouble.

30:46.303 --> 30:47.638
What did he
take this time?

30:47.680 --> 30:50.808
He didn't take anything.
He got taken.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.977
-Who took him?
-A Tyrannosaurus rex.

30:53.018 --> 30:54.478
A T-Rex took Mateo?

30:54.520 --> 30:56.105
Yes!

30:56.146 --> 30:57.356
Are you
imagining again?

31:02.736 --> 31:03.737
Here.

31:05.823 --> 31:06.907
Look.

31:08.784 --> 31:11.203
A Zuul?

31:11.245 --> 31:13.122
And?

31:17.876 --> 31:19.086
What?

31:19.128 --> 31:20.671
You don't see it?

31:20.713 --> 31:22.339
See what?

31:22.381 --> 31:23.465
Zuul.

31:25.509 --> 31:28.220
A 76 million
year old dinosaur?

31:28.262 --> 31:30.681
No, I don't.
Do you wanna know why?

31:30.723 --> 31:33.517
Because it's not
76 million years ago.

31:33.559 --> 31:35.019
This is my dino field guide,

31:35.060 --> 31:37.688
it's supposed to let
you see dinosaurs.

31:37.730 --> 31:39.315
For real.

31:39.356 --> 31:42.526
Well, special powers
don't seem to work on me.

31:42.568 --> 31:43.694
Now, give me back my bike.

31:45.279 --> 31:47.281
Why did it work on
Mateo and not you?

31:49.575 --> 31:52.953
Maybe because I believe
in science, not magic.

31:52.995 --> 31:54.788
Science is magic.

31:54.830 --> 31:56.915
Science is
the opposite of magic.

31:56.957 --> 31:58.459
Science is about facts.

31:58.500 --> 32:00.169
But where do
facts come from?

32:01.920 --> 32:04.048
They come from scientists
who have imagined things

32:04.089 --> 32:07.259
that no one else has
ever thought of before.

32:07.301 --> 32:09.637
I'm working on a dino
experiment right now

32:09.678 --> 32:13.015
that can change what we know
about dinosaurs forever.

32:13.057 --> 32:15.559
That, to me, is magical.

32:15.601 --> 32:17.353
But before I can
make history,

32:17.394 --> 32:18.979
I need to save
your brother.

32:19.021 --> 32:22.191
I mean, step-brother.

32:22.232 --> 32:24.109
You forgot your magic book.

32:24.151 --> 32:26.320
[Dana]
I'll get it from you later!

32:34.328 --> 32:36.622
Can't you and dad
just pick for me?

32:36.664 --> 32:39.333
You know you're old enough
to have a say in this decision.

32:40.793 --> 32:43.003
Aw, must be so hard
to have two families

32:43.045 --> 32:45.839
who love you so much they wanna
be around you all the time.

32:45.881 --> 32:48.008
It's exhausting.

32:48.050 --> 32:51.428
Listen, you need to think
about what's best for you.

32:51.470 --> 32:53.305
Whatever you decide,
we'll all understand.

32:55.766 --> 32:57.518
But, it would be
great to see you

32:57.559 --> 32:58.686
on more than just weekends.

33:00.479 --> 33:01.897
And California
does have beaches.

33:02.981 --> 33:04.149
Just saying.

33:05.567 --> 33:06.819
I love you, baby girl.

33:06.860 --> 33:08.153
I love you.

33:12.533 --> 33:13.617
[sighing]

33:20.040 --> 33:21.500
Everything aw'wight in here?

33:21.542 --> 33:24.086
[baby giggling]

33:25.879 --> 33:27.089
Tried to tell him you
wanted to be alone

33:27.131 --> 33:28.465
but he wouldn't take
no for an answer.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.008
Little stinker.

33:30.050 --> 33:31.468
Hmm.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.887
-Seriously, he stinks.
-Come here, baby.

33:33.929 --> 33:36.306
Say, hi, mom!

33:36.348 --> 33:37.891
Say,
hi, mom!

33:37.933 --> 33:39.476
Hi, hi.

33:43.939 --> 33:44.982
I've decided.

33:49.486 --> 33:51.280
[Jadiel]
Dino Dana.

33:52.448 --> 33:53.866
Dino Jadiel.

33:59.204 --> 34:03.125
How would a Triceratops escape
a pack of Albertosaurus?

34:03.167 --> 34:05.043
Hmm.
I'd love to solve that one.

34:10.757 --> 34:13.594
[dinosaurs roaring]

34:14.803 --> 34:16.847
That's not possible.

34:16.889 --> 34:19.683
[all roaring and growling]

34:22.811 --> 34:24.396
I can solve this.

34:24.438 --> 34:26.982
Some Triceratop fossils
have been found in groups.

34:27.024 --> 34:29.777
So, maybe they stuck
together for defense.

34:29.818 --> 34:34.697
[dinosaurs roaring]

34:44.291 --> 34:45.250
I was right.

34:45.292 --> 34:46.627
I was right!

34:46.668 --> 34:49.505
[grunting and roaring]

34:52.132 --> 34:53.217
Magical.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.344
[growling]

34:59.306 --> 35:00.224
And deadly!

35:16.782 --> 35:18.158

[growling]

35:24.498 --> 35:26.959
[Mateo]
Mama T-Rex, he's giving up.

35:27.000 --> 35:29.002
He's too tired.

35:29.044 --> 35:31.129
[spinosaurus grunting]

35:31.171 --> 35:32.881
You did it, mama T-Rex.

35:36.176 --> 35:39.096

36:03.203 --> 36:05.497
[high pitched chirps]

36:05.539 --> 36:06.623
Huh?

Who's there?

Aww.

Is this your baby?

36:38.322 --> 36:39.364
That's so cute!

36:40.824 --> 36:44.494

36:44.536 --> 36:46.121
Do you think
I'm in your family?

36:46.163 --> 36:49.625

36:49.666 --> 36:51.376
Do you want me to
be your brother?

[chirping]

36:54.880 --> 36:56.173
Aww.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.466
Okay!

36:57.507 --> 36:58.967
I'll be your brother,
baby T-Rex.

37:05.474 --> 37:06.934
Are you okay?

37:06.975 --> 37:08.477
What's wrong mama T-Rex?

37:08.518 --> 37:10.520
[heaving grunt]

37:10.562 --> 37:13.857
Ugh.

37:19.029 --> 37:21.156
Gross!

37:21.198 --> 37:22.783
Why did you do that?

37:26.912 --> 37:28.830
Eww.

37:28.872 --> 37:30.332
[chirps]

37:30.374 --> 37:33.961
No, baby T-Rex, I'm not hungry.

37:34.002 --> 37:37.589
[chirps]

37:37.631 --> 37:38.632
Ugh.

37:42.344 --> 37:44.930
Hey, we're gonna take our
new neighbors out for coffee,

37:44.972 --> 37:46.223
you wanna come?

37:46.264 --> 37:47.599
No thanks.

37:47.641 --> 37:49.184
I thought I'd wait
here to talk to Dana.

37:50.102 --> 37:51.395
Good idea.

37:51.436 --> 37:52.771
Can I bring you back anything?

37:54.815 --> 37:56.650
-I'm okay.
-You sure?

37:57.818 --> 37:58.860
Not even a hug?

38:05.534 --> 38:07.327
I'm sorry, dad.
[sobs]

38:07.369 --> 38:09.162
Don't be sad, sweetie.

38:11.790 --> 38:14.334
Now we have the best
excuse to go to the beach.

38:15.669 --> 38:17.129
Aww, that's better.

38:20.841 --> 38:22.843
You're really hungry.

38:22.884 --> 38:25.012
[chirps]

38:25.053 --> 38:26.179

38:26.221 --> 38:28.181
The Spinosaurus is back!

[both roar]

38:34.062 --> 38:35.147
Mama T-Rex!

38:37.691 --> 38:39.484
Mama T-Rex, be careful!

38:42.988 --> 38:44.031
[both roar]

38:44.072 --> 38:45.741
Watch out, mama T-Rex!

38:48.785 --> 38:51.288
[growls and yelps]

38:51.329 --> 38:52.539
Leave her alone!

38:54.583 --> 38:55.792
[roars]

38:55.834 --> 38:57.919
I'll take care of the baby, go!

39:01.757 --> 39:03.508
Stay behind me, baby.

39:03.550 --> 39:08.305
[squawks]

39:08.346 --> 39:09.598
[roars]

39:09.639 --> 39:10.974
Ahh!

39:13.351 --> 39:16.438
[roars]

39:23.070 --> 39:24.279
[Dana]
Take that spino!

39:29.618 --> 39:31.453
Time to run, Mateo!

39:33.872 --> 39:35.624
[screaming]

39:39.586 --> 39:41.546
[roars]

39:41.588 --> 39:42.547
Hurry, Mateo!

39:45.759 --> 39:47.844
Quick! Under here.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.013
[Mateo]
Come on, baby, under here.

39:51.306 --> 39:54.851
[roars]

39:54.893 --> 39:56.478
Hey spino!

39:56.520 --> 39:57.979
Chase me!

40:01.691 --> 40:03.610
It'll be okay, baby.
I promise.

40:05.612 --> 40:07.656
[sniffing]

40:07.697 --> 40:09.574
[roars]

40:09.616 --> 40:12.035
[screaming]

40:13.411 --> 40:14.579
Help!

40:16.498 --> 40:17.624
[roars]

40:17.666 --> 40:20.210
Pick on someone your own size.

40:20.252 --> 40:22.921
[roars]

40:22.963 --> 40:26.091
No, not me.
Run!

40:34.850 --> 40:37.227
I don't like this magic trick!

40:38.937 --> 40:40.188
Jadiel?

40:40.230 --> 40:41.940
They're following him.

40:41.982 --> 40:43.483
I'm counting on it.

40:43.525 --> 40:46.111
Jadiel, over here!

40:46.153 --> 40:47.612
Bring them this way!

40:49.990 --> 40:54.035
[dinosaurs roaring]

40:54.077 --> 40:55.954
Baby T-Rex, come back!

40:55.996 --> 40:57.581
No, Mateo!

40:59.040 --> 41:00.917
[Mateo]
Come back!

41:04.796 --> 41:06.965
[roars]

41:07.007 --> 41:08.884
Mateo, no, we need to go!

41:08.925 --> 41:10.635
I'm not leaving my
new little brother.

41:10.677 --> 41:12.888
What? Whoa!

41:16.558 --> 41:17.684
Watch out!

41:17.726 --> 41:20.061
Don't go in the herd, Mateo!

41:23.273 --> 41:24.774
[Mateo]
Don't be scared, baby.

41:24.816 --> 41:26.109
[squawks]

41:26.151 --> 41:28.612
Stay there, baby.
I'll get you.

41:28.653 --> 41:30.113
How am I gonna get over there?

41:34.075 --> 41:37.204
[grunting]

41:40.957 --> 41:42.542
[Dana]
How do I get to them?

41:44.211 --> 41:47.422
[grunting]

41:48.798 --> 41:49.716
This is gonna be fun.

41:50.842 --> 41:52.344
Hah.

41:52.385 --> 41:54.888
[stammering]

41:54.930 --> 41:58.808
[roars]

41:58.850 --> 42:00.352
The biggest land
carnivore of all time.

42:00.393 --> 42:02.979
The Spinosaurus has
more teeth than the...

42:03.021 --> 42:06.024
[roars]

42:08.318 --> 42:09.694
Tyrannosaurus rex!

42:16.034 --> 42:18.203
[growls]

42:18.245 --> 42:20.288
[Mateo] Diabloceratops,
he looks angry.

42:25.961 --> 42:28.088
[all roaring]

42:28.129 --> 42:29.381
Dana?

42:32.592 --> 42:34.261
I'm coming, Mateo!

42:34.302 --> 42:35.470
Ah, so is he!

42:38.723 --> 42:39.849
Almost there!

42:43.436 --> 42:45.814
-Thanks.
-It's okay.

42:45.855 --> 42:47.524
I've got you, you're safe.

42:48.775 --> 42:51.444
You stink, but you're safe.

42:51.486 --> 42:52.487
I wanna go home.

42:52.529 --> 42:54.281
I know, let's go.

42:56.950 --> 43:00.453
[tyrannosaurus rex roaring]

43:02.789 --> 43:05.875
[roaring and crunching]

43:08.253 --> 43:10.130
You wanna stay around
and see who wins?

43:10.171 --> 43:11.798
A bit.

43:14.301 --> 43:17.304
[dinosaurs roaring]

43:17.345 --> 43:18.471
Will she be okay, Dana?

43:18.513 --> 43:20.432
Oh, I hope so.

43:23.059 --> 43:25.937
[dinosaurs roaring]

43:27.439 --> 43:29.024
[Mateo]
Why did she puke on me?

43:29.065 --> 43:31.192
She wasn't puking, exactly.

43:31.234 --> 43:33.194
She was regurgitating
food for you.

43:33.236 --> 43:36.114
That's how some birds, like
penguins, feed their babies.

43:36.156 --> 43:38.158
I guess T-Rexes
weren't just tyrants.

43:38.199 --> 43:39.451
They were good moms too.

43:39.492 --> 43:41.036
Moms can be tyrants.

43:41.077 --> 43:42.704
Especially when
protecting her babies.

43:44.456 --> 43:47.667
Wait, does that mean when
you puke up to feed the baby?

43:47.709 --> 43:49.461
What do you mean, the baby?

43:50.545 --> 43:51.755
-Nothing.
-Mateo!

43:53.131 --> 43:54.758
I couldn't just
leave him there,

43:54.799 --> 43:56.676
he could've
gotten eaten.

43:56.718 --> 43:58.636
[baby tyrannosaurus
rex chirping]

43:58.678 --> 43:59.721
You didn't.

44:00.847 --> 44:02.223
[sighs]
You did.

44:07.645 --> 44:09.272
[distant thud]

44:13.735 --> 44:16.780
[distant rumbling and chirping]

44:23.370 --> 44:24.621
Dana?

44:24.662 --> 44:26.873
[murmuring]

44:33.963 --> 44:36.716
Huh, she really
does love dinosaurs.

44:44.516 --> 44:46.184
And me.

44:46.226 --> 44:49.437
These must be the experiments
she wanted us to do together.

44:53.233 --> 44:56.277
I really should have helped
her out with more of these.

44:56.319 --> 45:00.115
[rustling and murmuring]

45:00.156 --> 45:01.699
[Dana] Come on.

45:01.741 --> 45:03.701
Do you think if we make
loud noises, he'll go?

45:03.743 --> 45:04.828
Come on.

45:06.496 --> 45:08.790
You know what,
I don't need to know.

45:10.417 --> 45:12.585
Hi, I'm Saara, our parents
are out with yours.

45:12.627 --> 45:14.295
They'll be home soon.

45:14.337 --> 45:17.382
Dana, can I talk to
you for a second?

45:17.424 --> 45:18.508
He's coming out!

45:18.550 --> 45:20.051
[chirping]

45:20.093 --> 45:22.220
What was that?

45:23.221 --> 45:24.305
You heard it?

45:25.598 --> 45:26.891
A baby T-Rex.

45:26.933 --> 45:28.977
A baby T-Rex?
Really?

45:30.854 --> 45:33.898
Of course.
And how did it get here?

45:33.940 --> 45:35.942
It's a long story.

45:35.984 --> 45:38.486
I'm out. Dana?

45:38.528 --> 45:41.281
I got taken by a mama T-Rex,
who thought I was her baby,

45:41.322 --> 45:43.867
then a Spinosaurus
tried to eat me.

45:43.908 --> 45:46.953
But a whole herd of
Triceratops ran over to us

45:46.995 --> 45:48.538
and we got away.

45:48.580 --> 45:51.875
The mom T-Rex had a baby
T-Rex that Mateo took

45:51.916 --> 45:54.586
with him even though
he shouldn't have.

45:54.627 --> 45:56.504
I didn't want
Toby to get eaten.

45:56.546 --> 45:58.006
[both]
You named him?

45:58.047 --> 45:59.340
-We can't keep him.
-We're not gonna touch--

45:59.382 --> 46:00.967
[talking over each other]

46:01.009 --> 46:02.343
[Saara]
Okay! Stop.

46:02.385 --> 46:03.887
You guys need to grow up
and quit pretending

46:03.928 --> 46:05.930
you see dinosaurs everywhere.

46:05.972 --> 46:08.600
Maybe you need to grow
down and start believing

46:08.641 --> 46:10.768
we're dealing with
some serious stuff too.

46:10.810 --> 46:13.146
Super serious.

46:13.188 --> 46:16.274
Dana, I wish I
could live in a world

46:16.316 --> 46:19.277
where everything you
imagine becomes real.

46:19.319 --> 46:21.154
I really do.

46:21.196 --> 46:24.032
But we live in the real world.

46:24.073 --> 46:27.202
And in the real world
there are no more...

46:28.703 --> 46:30.246
[squawks]

46:30.288 --> 46:32.457
Dinosaurs.

46:35.877 --> 46:37.212
You wanna take anything back?

46:38.922 --> 46:42.383
But that's not possible.

46:42.425 --> 46:44.427
No, it's magical.

46:45.512 --> 46:47.305
Are you playing a trick on me?

46:47.347 --> 46:48.932
Is that a toy?

46:48.973 --> 46:52.644
[chirping]

46:52.685 --> 46:55.271
[Mateo]
He's on the run!

46:55.313 --> 46:57.357
[Dana]
It's okay, baby T-Rex.

46:57.398 --> 46:58.525
We're not gonna hurt you!

47:00.902 --> 47:02.612
[chirps]

47:02.654 --> 47:03.988
He's trying to hide again.

47:05.990 --> 47:07.700
What is happening?

47:07.742 --> 47:10.119
Baby dinosaurs,
like baby birds,

47:10.161 --> 47:13.331
learn to hide when they
think they're in danger.

47:13.373 --> 47:17.710
No, like, what is
happening, right now?

47:17.752 --> 47:19.629
You're growing down.

47:19.671 --> 47:22.340
My dino field guide,
lets people see dinosaurs,

47:22.382 --> 47:24.884
but only if they want to.

47:24.926 --> 47:26.386
I guess you want to see them.

47:28.846 --> 47:31.307
I wanted to spend more
time with you before I--

47:31.349 --> 47:33.393
We need to get that
baby back to it's mom.

47:33.434 --> 47:35.603
Unless we can't find his mom.

47:35.645 --> 47:38.356
Then we're gonna have
to feed Toby our puke.

47:38.398 --> 47:39.482
What?

47:40.775 --> 47:42.569
I'm calling mom and dad.

47:42.610 --> 47:43.778
They won't believe you.

47:45.905 --> 47:47.699
[phone ringing]

47:47.740 --> 47:48.658
-Yeah, anyway.
-Right.

47:50.326 --> 47:52.328
Hey, Saara.
Did you talk with Dana?

47:53.663 --> 47:55.081
Why not?

47:55.123 --> 47:56.791
Oh, T-Rex under the bed.

47:56.833 --> 47:58.876
-Oh yeah.
-Of course, makes sense.

47:58.918 --> 48:01.045
[Amin] No, no, you should
definitely take it back

48:01.087 --> 48:02.338
to it's mother.

48:02.380 --> 48:04.674
[laughing]

48:04.716 --> 48:06.968
Can Jadiel and Mateo go
with you to the park?

48:08.720 --> 48:11.556
-Yeah, that's fine with me.
-They say, yes.

48:11.598 --> 48:13.600
When are you gonna talk to--

48:13.641 --> 48:14.934
Thanks, sweetie, love you too!

48:16.769 --> 48:18.605
Well, I wouldn't say I'm
the best dad in the world

48:18.646 --> 48:19.939
but definitely top.

48:19.981 --> 48:21.232
She hung up on
you, didn't she?

48:21.274 --> 48:22.442
Yeah, like 10 seconds ago.

48:24.527 --> 48:27.155
Yeah, they didn't believe me.

48:27.196 --> 48:28.823
I tried to tell you.

48:28.865 --> 48:32.118
A lot of grownups forget how
to see the magic in science.

48:33.745 --> 48:36.247
I hope that never
happens to me.

48:36.289 --> 48:37.373
Me too.

48:39.125 --> 48:40.209
[chirps]

48:40.251 --> 48:42.378
[Mateo]
Look, there he is!

48:44.088 --> 48:46.841
I still don't know if
this is actually happening.

48:48.426 --> 48:50.803
But...

48:50.845 --> 48:51.846
okay.

48:53.139 --> 48:54.807
Let's get this baby back
to it's mother T-Rex.

48:55.850 --> 48:59.187
Everyone, grab a box.

48:59.228 --> 49:04.025
[rustling and screaming]
I got him!

49:07.987 --> 49:08.946
Ah!

49:10.198 --> 49:12.909
[chirps]

49:12.950 --> 49:14.369
Yah!

49:14.410 --> 49:16.496
[sighing]

49:21.417 --> 49:23.920
Ah!

49:23.961 --> 49:25.380
Come here!

49:25.421 --> 49:27.173
Come here, baby dino!

49:27.215 --> 49:28.466
Toby, it's me!

49:29.884 --> 49:31.094
I got him, I got him.

49:31.135 --> 49:33.221
[chirps]

49:37.350 --> 49:38.393
[sighs]

49:48.027 --> 49:49.987
Maybe he doesn't wanna
go back to his mom.

49:51.239 --> 49:53.658
Maybe he wants
to stay with us.

49:53.700 --> 49:55.660
[chirps]

49:57.620 --> 50:00.748
No, he's just worried we're
predators trying to eat him.

50:00.790 --> 50:03.418
We're not trying to
eat you, little brother.

50:03.459 --> 50:05.253
Brother?

50:05.294 --> 50:07.255
Think, Dana, think.

50:07.296 --> 50:09.257
Some bird brothers
and sisters take care

50:09.298 --> 50:11.384
of each other and since--

50:11.426 --> 50:13.511
Birds came from dinosaurs...

50:13.553 --> 50:17.014
Maybe dino brothers and sisters
take care of each other too.

50:17.056 --> 50:19.058
Yeah.

50:19.100 --> 50:21.185
It's T-Rex time.

50:24.814 --> 50:25.898
Ugh.

50:38.369 --> 50:39.662
Dana.

50:39.704 --> 50:41.789
Over there.

50:45.877 --> 50:49.005
[chirps]

50:49.046 --> 50:51.382
[Dana cooing]

50:56.637 --> 50:59.182
[Dana]
Okay, little friend.

50:59.223 --> 51:02.894
We're gonna get you
back to your mom.

51:02.935 --> 51:04.687
Would you like that?

51:04.729 --> 51:07.106
[chirps]

51:07.148 --> 51:08.524
I thought you would.

51:17.241 --> 51:19.911
[chirps]

51:19.952 --> 51:21.162
You're safe.

51:21.204 --> 51:22.955
[cooing]

51:22.997 --> 51:27.043
[chirps]

51:31.714 --> 51:33.007
Good boy.

51:33.049 --> 51:34.300
[applauding]
Wow!

51:34.342 --> 51:35.426
Yeah!
You're amazing!

51:35.468 --> 51:37.345
You did it.
Nice job.

51:37.386 --> 51:39.931
[Dana] What are
T-Rex sisters for?

51:39.972 --> 51:43.226
Now, let's get our little
friend back to his mom,

51:43.267 --> 51:46.145
so you can help me finish
dino experiment 9-0-1.

51:46.187 --> 51:47.772
Where are all the kid dinosaurs?

51:49.649 --> 51:52.026
Saara, you said you wanted
to spend more time with me.

51:54.195 --> 51:56.823
But, don't we have
a kid right there?

51:56.864 --> 51:58.407
This is a baby, not a kid.

51:59.700 --> 52:00.701
I'll explain on the way.

52:01.953 --> 52:02.954
Come on, Toby.

52:04.872 --> 52:05.832
So, for dino experiment 9-0-1,

52:07.291 --> 52:10.086
my working theory is that
some smaller dinosaurs

52:10.127 --> 52:13.589
are actually kid versions
of bigger dinosaurs.

52:13.631 --> 52:15.925
[Saara]That would mean
they're the same dinosaur.

52:15.967 --> 52:17.343
[Jadiel] Which means
some dinosaurs

52:17.385 --> 52:18.886
wouldn't exist anymore.

52:18.928 --> 52:20.555
But, I don't want
them to go away.

52:20.596 --> 52:22.223
They wouldn't go away,

52:22.265 --> 52:24.767
it's just our old
ideas about them would.

52:26.435 --> 52:27.937
Think of it more like they're
finding their families,

52:27.979 --> 52:30.481
just like we're
about to do for Toby.

52:30.523 --> 52:34.902
[chirps]

52:34.944 --> 52:36.070
We're almost there.

52:41.576 --> 52:43.536
Where's mama T-Rex?

52:45.997 --> 52:46.873
She's gone.

52:48.207 --> 52:49.542
But that means.

52:49.584 --> 52:50.877
We're Toby's family now.

52:52.545 --> 52:54.922
Mateo, we can't just
become it's family.

52:54.964 --> 52:56.507
Why?

52:56.549 --> 52:58.050
Because we're different.

52:58.092 --> 53:00.595
We're from different families
and now we're a family.

53:01.846 --> 53:04.390
[chirps]

53:04.432 --> 53:06.183
Yeah, but not really.

53:06.225 --> 53:08.936
We're step-brothers
not real brothers.

53:08.978 --> 53:12.106
Just like-- Mateo!
Where are you going?

53:12.148 --> 53:13.900
[chirps]

53:13.941 --> 53:15.151
[Dana]
Mateo don't go!

53:18.487 --> 53:21.741
[chirps]

53:21.782 --> 53:23.242
He does this, taking off.

53:25.244 --> 53:27.788
How 'bout you two keep
looking for the mom T-Rex.

53:29.582 --> 53:32.043
I'll go get Mateo.

53:37.506 --> 53:39.592
[sighing]

53:56.150 --> 54:00.863
[chirps]

54:00.905 --> 54:02.698
[sighing]

54:02.740 --> 54:05.076
He didn't wanna be my brother.

54:05.117 --> 54:06.786
But at least I have you.

54:07.995 --> 54:09.372
I'm okay, Toby.

54:09.413 --> 54:12.917
Sometimes I think
being a dinosaur

54:12.959 --> 54:14.794
would be easier
than being a person.

54:16.796 --> 54:17.964
Less feelings.

54:19.590 --> 54:20.800
Yeah.

54:22.343 --> 54:24.345
You know,
when my dad left,

54:24.387 --> 54:26.514
my mom was sad
for a long time.

54:28.140 --> 54:29.850
Me too.

54:29.892 --> 54:34.730
But then, my mom met Saara's
dad and she was happy again,

54:34.772 --> 54:39.610
and I met Saara
and she hated me.

54:39.652 --> 54:42.947
Only in the beginning because
I would take her stuff,

54:42.989 --> 54:45.908
follow her around,
and copied what she liked.

54:45.950 --> 54:47.702
I loved my new big seester.

54:49.245 --> 54:52.081
Why do you
call her seester?

54:52.123 --> 54:53.499
[Saara]
I made it up.

54:54.792 --> 54:58.045
Because I didn't know
what else to call her

54:58.087 --> 55:01.007
other than annoying.

55:01.048 --> 55:02.425
[sighs]

55:02.466 --> 55:05.344
And I didn't wanna
get too used to her

55:05.386 --> 55:06.637
in case they didn't stay.

55:09.223 --> 55:13.978
But, one day I realized
that whatever happens,

55:15.604 --> 55:17.606
nothing is going to
change the fact that Dana

55:17.648 --> 55:19.734
is always going to
be my little seester.

55:24.739 --> 55:25.823
Not even moving.

55:27.241 --> 55:28.534
You decided?

55:28.576 --> 55:30.578
I have another
part of my family

55:30.619 --> 55:31.704
I have to think about and--

55:31.746 --> 55:33.122
I get it.

55:33.164 --> 55:34.457
We should get back to
finding Toby's mom.

55:36.125 --> 55:37.334
[chirps]

55:37.376 --> 55:39.462
Maybe being a dinosaur
would be easier.

55:41.005 --> 55:42.048
Come on, Toby.

55:54.477 --> 55:58.564
[chirps]

55:59.899 --> 56:02.068
It's okay, Toby,
we'll find your mom.

56:17.249 --> 56:18.667
[dinosaur grunting]

56:18.709 --> 56:20.419
[chirps]

56:20.461 --> 56:21.712
What is it, Toby?

56:23.339 --> 56:25.716
Toby, there's your mom!

56:25.758 --> 56:27.301
She's hurt.

56:27.343 --> 56:29.678
-How bad?
-Pretty bad.

56:29.720 --> 56:32.181
[low rumbling]

56:34.308 --> 56:36.602
[Mateo]
Poor mama T-Rex.

56:36.644 --> 56:37.978
[dinosaurs grunting]

56:38.020 --> 56:39.438
Your mom's gonna be okay, baby.

56:41.315 --> 56:42.566
What are we gonna do?

56:42.608 --> 56:45.778
Whatever it is,
let's make it fast.

56:45.820 --> 56:47.738
What is that?

56:47.780 --> 56:49.949
[dinosaur squawking]

56:49.990 --> 56:51.200
Whoa!

56:51.242 --> 56:52.451
Quetzalcoatlus.

56:53.953 --> 56:56.372
[screeching]

56:56.413 --> 56:58.207
I thought you said they were

56:58.249 --> 57:01.335
the largest flying
thing of all time?

57:01.377 --> 57:02.795
They are.

57:04.588 --> 57:06.799
[Mateo] What is it doing?
Why is it coming over here?

57:06.841 --> 57:08.342
I think it knows

57:08.384 --> 57:10.219
she's too weak to protect
herself or her baby.

57:10.261 --> 57:11.804
[dinosaur roaring]

57:11.846 --> 57:13.848
It's not the only one!

57:13.889 --> 57:15.891
[roars]

57:15.933 --> 57:17.351
A nanotyrannus!

57:17.393 --> 57:18.936
Another tyrannosaur.

57:18.978 --> 57:20.855
Great, so won't it help
the T-Rex tyrannosaur?

57:20.896 --> 57:22.439
Nope, they're different.

57:22.481 --> 57:26.110
And tyrannosaurs are
known to fight each other.

57:26.152 --> 57:28.237
Think, Dana, think.

57:28.279 --> 57:29.405
[growls]

57:29.446 --> 57:30.823
[Saara]
Think faster!

57:32.366 --> 57:34.076
We have to do something.

57:34.118 --> 57:35.619
[roars]

57:35.661 --> 57:37.538
Too late.

57:37.580 --> 57:39.665
[distant squawking]

57:39.707 --> 57:41.584
[squawks]

57:41.625 --> 57:43.210
[Mateo]
Toby, watch out!

57:43.252 --> 57:44.795
Mateo, don't look.

57:44.837 --> 57:46.714
[Dana]
What do we do?

57:46.755 --> 57:47.965
[squawks]

57:48.007 --> 57:49.216
Mateo, look.

57:49.258 --> 57:50.801
I thought I
wasn't supposed to.

57:50.843 --> 57:52.219
Look!

57:52.261 --> 57:56.974
[dinosaurs screeching]

57:59.268 --> 58:01.437
He's helping mama T-Rex!

58:01.478 --> 58:03.647
[Dana]
This doesn't make any sense.

58:03.689 --> 58:07.776
Why is the Nanotyrannus helping
the mama and baby T-Rex?

58:07.818 --> 58:09.486
They're not from
the same family.

58:10.905 --> 58:12.239
Wait.

58:12.281 --> 58:14.700
We were too focused on
what made them different

58:14.742 --> 58:16.911
to see what made them the same!

58:16.952 --> 58:19.121
It's dino experiment 9-0-ah!

58:20.831 --> 58:22.541
-Saara!
-Dana!

58:22.583 --> 58:24.460
[screaming]

58:24.501 --> 58:25.961
Saara!

58:26.003 --> 58:28.797
[screaming]

58:28.839 --> 58:29.965
I got you.

58:30.007 --> 58:31.592
Me too!

58:33.093 --> 58:34.470
Me three and Toby makes four.

58:35.596 --> 58:36.847
Don't let go!

58:36.889 --> 58:39.558
[screaming]

58:39.600 --> 58:40.643
Hold on tight!

58:45.314 --> 58:47.233
-Dana!
-Saara!

58:47.274 --> 58:48.817
Saara, help me!

58:48.859 --> 58:51.111
Follow that--
Quetzalcoatlus!

58:51.153 --> 58:52.446
Yes!

58:53.614 --> 58:56.951
[chirps]

58:58.702 --> 58:59.995
I gotta go, Toby.

59:01.372 --> 59:03.290
You look after your
mommy until she's better.

59:03.332 --> 59:04.583
I have to help
my new friend.

59:06.585 --> 59:08.545
[Jadiel]
Come on, Mateo.

59:08.587 --> 59:11.340
[chirps]

59:11.382 --> 59:15.219
[grunting]

59:15.261 --> 59:18.639
[Dana screaming]

59:20.391 --> 59:21.517
Hurry!

59:23.769 --> 59:25.229
Saara!

59:27.147 --> 59:28.315
[Jadiel]
There she is.

59:33.696 --> 59:35.322
[Dana]
Saara!

59:35.364 --> 59:37.825
It's too fast for us.

59:37.866 --> 59:39.201
[Dana]
Help!

59:39.243 --> 59:40.995
We need to come up
with another plan.

59:44.665 --> 59:47.668
[Dana]
Where are you taking me?

59:47.710 --> 59:49.086
Where is it taking her?

59:49.128 --> 59:51.171
I don't know but maybe we
should call our parents again.

59:51.213 --> 59:52.715
Yeah, that'll work.

59:52.756 --> 59:54.800
Uh, hey dad, a giant
flying dinosaur took Dana,

59:54.842 --> 59:55.843
can we go look for her?

59:55.884 --> 59:57.511
Uh, sure kids, have fun!

59:57.553 --> 59:59.054
Technically it's a pterosaur.

59:59.096 --> 01:00:00.264
Not helpful.

01:00:00.306 --> 01:00:01.473
How do we get her back?

01:00:01.515 --> 01:00:03.058
What would Dana do?

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:06.478
Think, Saara, think.

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.605
[sighing]

01:00:09.898 --> 01:00:11.442
You could think too.

01:00:11.483 --> 01:00:13.319
Oh, well, what do we
know about Quetzalcoatlus?

01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:14.737
They're super big.

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:16.530
-Yes!
-And really tall.

01:00:16.572 --> 01:00:17.948
Kind of the same thing.

01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:19.908
They build their
nests on mountains.

01:00:22.119 --> 01:00:23.412
Dana told me that.

01:00:23.454 --> 01:00:24.872
Do you think it's
taking her to it's nest?

01:00:24.913 --> 01:00:26.623
That's where
mama T-Rex took me.

01:00:28.125 --> 01:00:29.543
But there are no
mountains around here.

01:00:29.585 --> 01:00:31.170
There's no mountains

01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:33.922
but there is a building
that looks like a mountain.

01:00:47.478 --> 01:00:49.813
And here she is,
the Quetzalcoatlus,

01:00:49.855 --> 01:00:52.649
the largest flying
creature ever discovered.

01:00:52.691 --> 01:00:53.692
[Kids]
Whoa!

01:00:54.777 --> 01:00:56.362
[tour guide]
Yeah, whoa!

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:58.655
Paleontologists think it
plucked dinosaurs right off

01:00:58.697 --> 01:01:00.949
the ground, but it would
have had to pluck a lot

01:01:00.991 --> 01:01:03.660
of dinosaurs because this
prehistoric winged creature

01:01:03.702 --> 01:01:05.788
was as tall as a giraffe.

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:07.289
[Kids]
Whoa!

01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:10.584
[Dana] Why are you
taking me to the museum?

01:01:10.626 --> 01:01:12.711
[tour guide]
Did you guys know it's wings

01:01:12.753 --> 01:01:14.755
were as long as a bus?

01:01:14.797 --> 01:01:16.924
How long do you think
it's beak is?

01:01:18.300 --> 01:01:20.344
Help!

01:01:20.386 --> 01:01:23.138
Hello? Anyone!

01:01:23.180 --> 01:01:24.807
[squawks]

01:01:31.855 --> 01:01:33.357
[Dana]
Help me!

01:01:35.734 --> 01:01:36.693
Help!

01:01:39.113 --> 01:01:40.406
[Dana screaming]

01:01:40.447 --> 01:01:41.782
You were right.

01:01:41.824 --> 01:01:43.075
-Follow me.
-Where?

01:01:43.117 --> 01:01:44.743
Up there.

01:01:47.788 --> 01:01:50.290
And if you thought
the Quetzalcoatlus was big,

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:53.210
wait until you see
our Tyrannosaurus rex.

01:01:53.252 --> 01:01:54.253
Let's go!

01:02:02.136 --> 01:02:04.555
-Which way?
-This way.

01:02:07.141 --> 01:02:09.435
[squawks]

01:02:09.476 --> 01:02:11.145

01:02:11.186 --> 01:02:13.397
[squawks]

01:02:18.152 --> 01:02:19.611
What do you want?

01:02:22.197 --> 01:02:26.285
You're not trying to eat me,
so what are you trying to do?

01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:27.828
[squawks]

01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:31.623
What are you doing?

01:02:31.665 --> 01:02:34.042
I'm not for you, am I?

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:37.588
[long squawk]

01:02:40.299 --> 01:02:41.216
I'm for them!

01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:46.638
[grunting]

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:50.267
At least they haven't started...

[crackling]

01:02:53.812 --> 01:02:55.230
Hatching!

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:06.533
[Saara]
We have to hurry.

01:03:06.575 --> 01:03:08.202
[Jadiel]
How many more stairs?

01:03:08.243 --> 01:03:09.661
[Saara]
A lot!

[screams]

01:03:15.876 --> 01:03:17.878
You don't wanna eat me.

[screehing and chirping]

01:03:24.885 --> 01:03:26.470
Dana!

01:03:26.512 --> 01:03:27.513
There she is.

01:03:29.890 --> 01:03:31.266
We have to get to her.

01:03:32.768 --> 01:03:34.269
[Jadiel]
Come on, Mateo.

01:03:39.149 --> 01:03:42.653
[squawks]

01:03:45.072 --> 01:03:46.365
I'm not gonna be baby food.

01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:59.294
[screeching]

01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:00.420
Get off of me!

01:04:01.713 --> 01:04:05.968
[panting]

01:04:06.009 --> 01:04:07.094
Hurry!

01:04:11.431 --> 01:04:13.517
I think we're almost there.

01:04:14.643 --> 01:04:16.687
[baby quetzalcoatlus screeching]

01:04:18.772 --> 01:04:19.856

[grumbles and squawks]

01:04:25.279 --> 01:04:26.405
[Dana]
Oh.

01:04:29.157 --> 01:04:31.076
You're not one of those
parents who cut up

01:04:31.118 --> 01:04:32.911
their kids' food are you?

01:04:32.953 --> 01:04:34.454

No, they're all from

look the same.

The kid and the grownup have
different things on their head.

Yeah, the grownups crest
is totally different.

Maybe we need to stop looking
at what things different

what makes the same.

that some of these dinos

They'll still be here.
Just with different names.

That's one of my favorite
things about science.

01:09:35.421 --> 01:09:36.923

know something,

01:09:36.965 --> 01:09:38.675

something new,

knew has suddenly changed.
