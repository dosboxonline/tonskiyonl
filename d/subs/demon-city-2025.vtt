00:08.125 --> 00:12.749
WHEN A PERSON IS CONSUMED
BY THE DESIRE FOR REVENGE,

00:12.750 --> 00:16.666
THEY BECOME A DEMON.

01:21.916 --> 01:24.166
What was that?

01:25.458 --> 01:28.082
- Say that again.
- Well...

01:28.083 --> 01:34.458
"Do you realize how much we've been
looking after you all this time?"

01:35.083 --> 01:38.375
That's what I told the president
of the dockworkers' union.

01:39.375 --> 01:43.040
Out of nowhere, he said,
"We can't take orders from you anymore."

01:43.041 --> 01:45.333
I said, "What the hell is your deal?"

01:48.625 --> 01:49.625
And then?

01:50.125 --> 01:52.082
Then he said,

01:52.083 --> 01:56.333
"Keep ordering us around the port area,
and the entire city will..."

01:57.291 --> 02:03.583
"The city's people, its institutions,
and even its history will turn on you."

02:08.208 --> 02:09.416
Shinjo City's

02:11.083 --> 02:12.041
"institutions"?

02:12.833 --> 02:16.708
Yes, and its "people" and "history."

02:17.541 --> 02:20.708
They'll "turn on us"?

02:21.333 --> 02:22.291
Yes.

02:26.333 --> 02:27.666
What does that mean?

02:28.833 --> 02:32.166
Honestly, I'm not quite sure.

02:44.875 --> 02:46.708
- Kneel.
- Yes, sir.

02:49.750 --> 02:54.625
Why the hell did he suddenly adopt
such a disrespectful tone?

02:56.875 --> 02:57.708
Well?

02:58.208 --> 02:59.375
What happened?

03:00.375 --> 03:01.958
I... don't know.

03:03.208 --> 03:05.750
Do your fucking job!

03:42.458 --> 03:43.333
What the...

03:44.083 --> 03:45.041
Let's move.

03:45.666 --> 03:47.000
- Moving out!
- Okay!

03:57.458 --> 03:58.500
The second floor!

04:10.583 --> 04:12.374
What the hell?

04:12.375 --> 04:14.083
- Move!
- This way, boss! Hurry!

04:25.416 --> 04:26.291
Drive.

04:27.291 --> 04:28.208
I said drive!

04:29.208 --> 04:30.041
Shit.

04:30.625 --> 04:32.458
- What's going on?
- Let's move.

04:37.708 --> 04:38.541
This way.

06:13.250 --> 06:14.291
No!

06:52.125 --> 06:53.000
Wait.

06:53.666 --> 06:54.958
Wait. Please.

07:20.458 --> 07:21.458
Well done.

07:28.375 --> 07:29.375
Hey, Sakata.

07:32.416 --> 07:34.333
You're walking away from this?

07:45.916 --> 07:48.166
Should've never let you have a family.

07:50.083 --> 07:51.541
It was a blast.

08:44.208 --> 08:45.250
Daddy!

08:45.750 --> 08:47.708
I'm home!

08:50.083 --> 08:52.874
Oh no. You're soaking wet!

08:52.875 --> 08:54.250
Ryo, you'll get wet too.

08:55.916 --> 08:57.665
Come on, stop it!

08:57.666 --> 09:00.790
People usually use umbrellas.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.165
Come here.

09:02.166 --> 09:03.540
- Go shower.
- Okay.

09:03.541 --> 09:04.708
But wait a sec.

09:08.250 --> 09:09.750
Hey, Ryo,

09:10.791 --> 09:12.041
did you get taller?

09:13.541 --> 09:15.624
Well, I guess so.

09:15.625 --> 09:18.458
You guess so? Wanna check later?

09:19.375 --> 09:20.208
- Yeah.
- Okay.

09:25.375 --> 09:29.166
There we go. Right this way, please.

09:34.291 --> 09:36.125
Okay, let's finish up while we wait.

09:45.125 --> 09:48.291
Maybe I'll look for a new job tomorrow.

09:51.791 --> 09:54.333
Let's celebrate, darling.

09:56.041 --> 09:56.875
Yeah.

09:58.125 --> 09:58.958
Okay.

10:27.583 --> 10:28.666
No!

10:31.666 --> 10:32.666
No!

10:55.833 --> 10:57.333
Daddy.

11:02.625 --> 11:03.750
Welcome home.

11:07.875 --> 11:10.791
To think a badass hit man like you

11:11.625 --> 11:14.166
would have such a lovely family.

11:20.916 --> 11:21.916
Who are you?

11:23.333 --> 11:27.166
We'll be running things in town
from now on.

11:27.708 --> 11:32.250
The yakuza group that controlled
the port area was a thorn in our side.

11:32.791 --> 11:35.333
You did us a solid by eliminating them.

11:38.375 --> 11:43.291
Word is, you're quitting the business
for the sake of your family.

11:51.208 --> 11:52.750
Get off me, asshole!

12:00.666 --> 12:04.375
Doesn't this contradict
the whole suicide script?

12:06.041 --> 12:08.832
Some injuries won't be an issue.
I'll handle it.

12:08.833 --> 12:10.833
Okay. Proceed.

12:11.666 --> 12:13.333
Don't hurt my daddy!

12:14.291 --> 12:15.291
Ryo!

12:19.791 --> 12:23.125
Please let Ryo go.

12:24.041 --> 12:25.499
I'm begging you!

12:25.500 --> 12:30.375
Please!

12:32.583 --> 12:35.000
- Shut the fuck up, Mom.
- Please! Plea--

12:45.375 --> 12:48.458
Mommy?

12:53.666 --> 12:54.666
Please.

12:56.666 --> 12:57.916
Don't.

13:03.208 --> 13:04.208
I'm begging you.

13:09.833 --> 13:11.416
Daddy.

13:12.416 --> 13:14.500
Ryo, run!

13:42.875 --> 13:44.000
Sakata.

13:45.333 --> 13:49.750
They say there's a demon here in Shinjo.

13:51.208 --> 13:58.000
Word is, it possesses someone
once every 50 years,

13:58.791 --> 14:01.750
and they go on a killing spree.

14:03.875 --> 14:09.708
We must protect this city from that demon.

14:11.333 --> 14:14.833
Please understand, Sakata.

14:19.750 --> 14:21.000
I'm gonna kill you.

14:28.416 --> 14:29.833
One day, I swear...

14:32.541 --> 14:34.250
I'll kill all of you.

14:36.083 --> 14:37.166
Is that so?

14:45.333 --> 14:46.791
I'll be waiting.

15:03.625 --> 15:05.124
<i>Last night, around 11:00 p.m.,</i>

15:05.125 --> 15:08.333
<i>a shooting occurred
at a Shinjo City residence.</i>

15:08.833 --> 15:11.915
<i>The suspect was identified
as Shuhei Sakata.</i>

15:11.916 --> 15:15.124
<i>He is believed to have shot his wife, Aoi,</i>

15:15.125 --> 15:20.833
<i>and their five-year-old daughter, Ryo,
before shooting himself in the head.</i>

15:21.541 --> 15:27.083
<i>Neighbors contacted local authorities
after hearing several gunshot-like sounds.</i>

16:46.041 --> 16:50.083
12 YEARS LATER

16:55.250 --> 16:58.874
I'll call you later
and tell you everything.

16:58.875 --> 17:01.041
I'll transfer the money once I get it.

17:01.833 --> 17:03.500
I have to go.

17:05.125 --> 17:07.458
I'll call again. Okay, bye.

17:22.500 --> 17:24.708
Come on. Let's go.

17:28.708 --> 17:33.582
Until about a decade ago,
Shinjo City was just a provincial city

17:33.583 --> 17:38.041
struggling economically
and unable to halt its population decline.

17:38.708 --> 17:44.791
Mayor Sunohara, what is your take
on the changes since then?

17:46.333 --> 17:50.291
Shinjo City now stands
at a historical juncture.

17:50.875 --> 17:55.000
This didn't come about
by chance, of course.

17:56.708 --> 18:02.374
It was achieved
through the hard work, perseverance,

18:02.375 --> 18:07.624
and courage of its citizens
over the past decade-plus.

18:07.625 --> 18:11.874
Nevertheless, it all started
after you, Mayor Sunohara,

18:11.875 --> 18:14.958
assumed office in Shinjo City.

18:15.541 --> 18:17.250
That's how I see it.

18:18.916 --> 18:20.500
That's an exaggeration.

18:21.333 --> 18:27.790
And now, we're expecting tourists
from all over Japan and the world over

18:27.791 --> 18:30.916
to gather here in Shinjo City, correct?

18:31.541 --> 18:33.041
Yes, that's right.

18:38.250 --> 18:39.999
Esteemed members of the press,

18:40.000 --> 18:44.541
we are just six months from opening
the integrated resort, Mahoroba.

18:45.875 --> 18:48.582
Theaters, retail floors, restaurants,

18:48.583 --> 18:52.083
as well as a hotel
and international conference facilities.

18:52.666 --> 18:55.416
Plus, Japan's first full-fledged casino.

18:55.916 --> 19:00.958
It's a one-stop paradise
that enriches every aspect of our lives.

19:01.458 --> 19:03.833
That is Mahoroba.

19:35.666 --> 19:37.958
Any further questions?

19:40.500 --> 19:41.708
Please, go ahead.

19:45.625 --> 19:48.000
I'm Kamiyama, a journalist.

19:49.958 --> 19:55.415
Shinjo City has seen a 15% increase
in missing persons in the past few years.

19:55.416 --> 19:58.915
The leader of the group opposing
Mahoroba's construction vanished,

19:58.916 --> 20:03.124
and the issue of redevelopment
displacing residents was swept under--

20:03.125 --> 20:05.790
Excuse me.
Please keep your questions brief.

20:05.791 --> 20:07.500
My apologies.

20:09.583 --> 20:13.165
You highlighted Shinjo City's
transformation into a better place,

20:13.166 --> 20:17.958
but what about the high rate
of inexplicable happenings?

20:18.500 --> 20:20.374
Care to comment, Mr. Mayor?

20:20.375 --> 20:22.832
You mentioned an increase
in missing persons

20:22.833 --> 20:26.208
and the leader
of the opposition vanishing.

20:27.458 --> 20:28.958
But are those facts?

20:30.125 --> 20:32.540
Have the police ever made such statements?

20:32.541 --> 20:35.249
- Based on my investigation--
- Mr. Kamiyama.

20:35.250 --> 20:38.250
Let's keep this fact-based. Facts only.

20:38.750 --> 20:43.249
If you're out to smear
this city's reputation,

20:43.250 --> 20:46.415
I kindly ask that you reconsider.

20:46.416 --> 20:47.499
But this--

20:47.500 --> 20:50.124
You know very well

20:50.125 --> 20:53.416
the consequences of defamation.

20:56.375 --> 20:57.875
Okay, next, please.

21:00.666 --> 21:05.708
SHINJO INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX

21:21.833 --> 21:23.625
This city changed quite a bit

21:24.125 --> 21:26.166
in just a decade or so, huh?

22:20.291 --> 22:23.166
Sorry for the shabby place.

22:24.791 --> 22:27.708
Please bear with it
till we find somewhere safe.

22:29.791 --> 22:30.875
Look after him.

22:31.458 --> 22:32.291
Yes, sir.

22:38.416 --> 22:39.250
Okay.

22:47.041 --> 22:49.125
Time to eat, Mr. Sakata.

22:53.125 --> 22:54.041
Here you go.

23:07.791 --> 23:10.750
- Take him on walks once in a while.
- Yes, sir.

23:11.416 --> 23:12.583
I'll leave him to you.

23:43.708 --> 23:46.625
Sakata!

23:48.333 --> 23:52.915
You remember this arm, don't you?!

23:52.916 --> 23:54.957
He can't understand you.

23:54.958 --> 23:57.333
He can't feel a thing! Don't!

24:03.500 --> 24:04.666
Sakat--

24:10.041 --> 24:12.125
Damn you!

24:31.375 --> 24:33.958
<i>So they're called the Kimen-gumi?</i>

24:34.458 --> 24:37.250
<i>Yeah. But I've never seen them myself.</i>

24:38.583 --> 24:41.250
So it was 12 years ago.

24:42.208 --> 24:45.582
Your yakuza gang, the Kono-gumi,
controlled the port

24:45.583 --> 24:47.958
till the Kimen-gumi wiped you guys out.

24:48.500 --> 24:52.374
Ever since, they've staked their claim
in and around the port area,

24:52.375 --> 24:53.708
including Mahoroba.

24:54.250 --> 24:56.916
Is that correct, Mr. Kaneko?

24:58.000 --> 24:59.375
Yeah, that's right.

25:00.041 --> 25:03.875
A lone hit man
hired by the Kimen-gumi attacked us.

25:04.375 --> 25:09.958
So, the attack by the hit man
occurred 12 years ago,

25:10.750 --> 25:14.332
right when Mahoroba
was granted its business license.

25:14.333 --> 25:19.625
Above all, that was around the time
Sunohara became mayor.

25:30.708 --> 25:34.040
The Kimen-gumi was able
to expand its power

25:34.041 --> 25:37.416
through drug dealing
and human trafficking.

25:38.333 --> 25:39.540
"Human trafficking"?

25:39.541 --> 25:42.625
Shinjo City seemed prosperous
over the past decade

25:43.125 --> 25:45.458
because the funds
from the Kimen-gumi's crimes...

25:47.291 --> 25:48.291
Huh?

25:57.375 --> 25:58.458
Hey...

26:06.000 --> 26:07.666
What the hell?!

26:09.791 --> 26:11.832
Hey...

26:11.833 --> 26:12.916
Shit!

26:41.208 --> 26:44.500
Please. I still have a little one.

26:45.208 --> 26:49.082
I'll keep my mouth shut
and skip town first thing tomorrow.

26:49.083 --> 26:51.250
I mean it. I swear!

27:09.875 --> 27:11.458
Come now.

27:12.708 --> 27:14.416
You have a family, right?

27:15.291 --> 27:16.916
Place your finger here.

27:34.625 --> 27:37.583
Okay, I'll take care of the rest here.

27:51.166 --> 27:52.125
What the...

27:54.416 --> 27:55.666
Holy hell!

28:04.416 --> 28:07.040
<i>Sakata has a family.</i>

28:07.041 --> 28:10.832
<i>He's walking away from this life,
so please leave him be.</i>

28:10.833 --> 28:13.750
<i>You promised not to kill him!</i>

28:36.458 --> 28:37.458
What is it?

28:39.666 --> 28:40.500
What?

28:57.875 --> 29:00.416
Chief! I didn't expect you here.

29:01.125 --> 29:02.457
What have we got?

29:02.458 --> 29:05.040
Given the neighborhood, a drunken brawler?

29:05.041 --> 29:09.332
Yeah, but he was just released
from a prison hospital the other day,

29:09.333 --> 29:12.415
so there's a chance
he got mixed up in something.

29:12.416 --> 29:14.915
And here we are, called in to handle it.

29:14.916 --> 29:16.125
I see.

29:17.083 --> 29:19.582
Thanks for working late,
but that's enough.

29:19.583 --> 29:21.666
Here, go get shitfaced.

29:22.875 --> 29:24.999
Okay, we'll take you up on that.

29:25.000 --> 29:26.290
- Shall we?
- Yeah.

29:26.291 --> 29:27.875
- Thanks.
- Thank you, sir.

29:28.916 --> 29:29.916
- Thanks.
- Sure.

29:32.541 --> 29:34.500
- Where to?
- Someplace cheap.

29:42.833 --> 29:47.833
Been a while, Sakata.

29:48.458 --> 29:50.375
Remember me?

29:52.291 --> 29:57.250
It's a pity you ended up like this.

30:01.333 --> 30:02.291
That night,

30:03.250 --> 30:05.958
when we realized you weren't dead,

30:06.708 --> 30:11.125
our master ordered us
to let you live for some reason.

30:13.041 --> 30:14.500
But truth be told...

30:16.833 --> 30:19.625
we should've finished you off.

30:22.541 --> 30:25.041
Twelve years...

30:25.958 --> 30:28.041
To think 12 years have gone by.

30:29.416 --> 30:30.333
Have you seen it?

30:30.833 --> 30:32.875
The changes in Shinjo City.

30:33.375 --> 30:34.374
The progress!

30:34.375 --> 30:35.500
Well?

30:36.583 --> 30:41.458
That nearly-dead city
has come this far, Sakata!

30:42.166 --> 30:44.000
Oh, right.

30:45.041 --> 30:46.583
Let me take a picture.

30:47.166 --> 30:50.291
I gotta capture the moment of your death.

31:00.208 --> 31:02.166
Some resisted the changes.

31:02.791 --> 31:05.000
Of course, I understand how they feel.

31:05.500 --> 31:09.665
But what really matters
is having the courage

31:09.666 --> 31:11.750
to overcome fleeting pain and grief!

32:22.916 --> 32:24.750
What the hell?

32:28.708 --> 32:30.625
- What are you doing?!
- Wait!

32:33.375 --> 32:36.291
Oh, my apologies, sir.

32:37.166 --> 32:37.999
Are you hurt?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.458
I'm fine. No problem at all.

32:42.541 --> 32:43.832
What happened?

32:43.833 --> 32:47.040
Sakata suddenly went berserk.

32:47.041 --> 32:49.665
Sorry, but could you put him back in bed?

32:49.666 --> 32:51.333
Yes, sir.

32:52.625 --> 32:55.291
Do you know him, sir?

32:55.875 --> 32:56.791
Why do you ask?

32:57.291 --> 32:58.291
Well, it's just...

33:01.583 --> 33:05.000
Let's just say... it's complicated.

33:05.500 --> 33:07.207
Let's do this.

33:07.208 --> 33:09.082
I'll get his legs.

33:09.083 --> 33:11.166
Okay, ready...

33:13.000 --> 33:15.500
- Okay, lifting.
- Here goes...

33:18.333 --> 33:19.458
Huh?

33:24.375 --> 33:26.040
Leave the rest to me.

33:26.041 --> 33:29.374
We'll say Sakata grabbed his gun
and went berserk.

33:29.375 --> 33:30.458
Thanks.

33:31.083 --> 33:32.625
So, what in the world...

33:34.000 --> 33:35.125
Well...

33:52.291 --> 33:54.166
Goddammit.

34:01.958 --> 34:03.375
Hey! Hey! Hey!

34:31.333 --> 34:33.375
Stop!

34:48.375 --> 34:49.708
Damn you!

35:48.666 --> 35:50.708
Please step back.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.125
No way.

36:29.666 --> 36:32.125
<i>- Daddy.
- Please just let Ryo go.</i>

36:32.750 --> 36:33.666
<i>I'm begging you!</i>

36:52.583 --> 36:54.083
- Drive.
- Yes, sir.

37:05.375 --> 37:06.624
- Batteries.
- Right.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.499
- They go here.
- Yes, sir.

37:08.500 --> 37:09.624
Don't miss any.

37:09.625 --> 37:11.582
See? You missed that.

37:11.583 --> 37:12.500
Got it.

37:53.750 --> 37:55.790
Mr. Shinozuka was killed.

37:55.791 --> 37:56.875
What?

37:57.458 --> 38:01.249
<i>At the hospital, by Shuhei Sakata.</i>

38:01.250 --> 38:04.916
Sakata? You mean...

38:06.333 --> 38:09.083
<i>Yes, that Sakata.</i>

38:10.500 --> 38:13.250
<i>He was recently released
but then hospitalized</i>

38:13.875 --> 38:16.499
<i>after a Kono-gumi member stabbed him.</i>

38:16.500 --> 38:20.041
It seems Mr. Shinozuka was killed
when he paid him a visit.

38:20.791 --> 38:21.875
How's the master?

38:23.041 --> 38:23.916
<i>Well...</i>

38:26.166 --> 38:29.208
The master is rather thrilled.

38:44.083 --> 38:45.375
Where are you?

38:46.500 --> 38:49.125
The port. We're shipping them out.

38:49.916 --> 38:51.416
<i>Is that right?</i>

38:52.708 --> 38:56.374
<i>But the question is
how he suddenly started moving</i>

38:56.375 --> 38:59.083
<i>after being in a coma for 12 years.</i>

39:10.958 --> 39:12.875
Where is Sakata now?

39:16.041 --> 39:18.791
As a matter of fact...

39:22.041 --> 39:24.333
<i>he's with Fujita as we speak.</i>

39:30.041 --> 39:31.624
FROM: UNKNOWN
TO: AKIRA FUJITA

39:31.625 --> 39:33.375
KILL HIM AND BRING ME HIS BODY

39:36.833 --> 39:38.875
Shuhei Sakata.

39:40.333 --> 39:46.166
That demon is on the move
here in Shinjo City.

40:05.083 --> 40:05.916
<i>Well...</i>

40:10.791 --> 40:13.041
we have a demon to slay.

40:19.166 --> 40:23.957
<i>The will of</i>

40:23.958 --> 40:30.666
<i>The fierce gods</i>

40:31.958 --> 40:38.958
<i>Is like the parting</i>

40:44.500 --> 40:50.250
<i>Of the eight-fold clouds</i>

40:50.833 --> 40:57.791
<i>That are in heaven</i>

41:11.541 --> 41:15.625
SHINJO CLEANING SYSTEM

42:03.750 --> 42:05.625
Okay, it's Sakata.

42:09.666 --> 42:12.125
Good. Get rid of him.

42:38.875 --> 42:39.791
Let's go.

42:44.916 --> 42:46.000
Drive. Now.

42:46.625 --> 42:47.625
Yes. Sorry.

42:55.875 --> 42:58.041
- Don't make that face.
- Yes, sir.

43:41.291 --> 43:42.375
What's his problem?!

44:00.833 --> 44:03.791
Fujita, you traitor!

44:10.958 --> 44:11.833
Yeah?

45:23.583 --> 45:24.500
Son of a bitch!

48:28.041 --> 48:28.875
Yes?

48:29.916 --> 48:33.208
<i>That's not like you
to use brute force, Ikkaku.</i>

48:35.416 --> 48:37.041
Did you see that?

48:38.458 --> 48:39.708
I apologize.

48:41.291 --> 48:43.708
I made you sacrifice your plant.

48:44.208 --> 48:45.208
<i>No worries.</i>

48:45.875 --> 48:48.541
<i>I planted a bomb in case of emergencies.</i>

48:49.375 --> 48:51.958
<i>I'm glad it did its job.</i>

48:53.041 --> 48:55.125
Yes. Thank you.

48:55.791 --> 48:57.749
<i>No trouble at all,</i>

48:57.750 --> 48:59.625
<i>Master.</i>

49:01.708 --> 49:02.541
<i>Huh?</i>

49:04.000 --> 49:05.000
<i>What is it?</i>

49:16.833 --> 49:18.166
What's this?!

49:21.416 --> 49:22.916
Excuse me a moment.

49:46.041 --> 49:47.333
Well done.

50:00.041 --> 50:01.166
Sakata.

50:04.791 --> 50:05.833
I'm sorry about...

50:08.916 --> 50:12.375
your wife... and daughter.

50:14.166 --> 50:16.041
I'm the one who told them.

50:17.041 --> 50:19.416
I also deserve to die.

50:22.333 --> 50:25.875
Do what you want with me.

51:22.125 --> 51:23.416
Sakata,

51:24.791 --> 51:29.875
you can't see the forest for the trees.

51:31.333 --> 51:34.332
You only focus
on a tiny sliver of the world.

51:34.333 --> 51:36.458
I feel sorry for you.

51:38.541 --> 51:39.875
As for us,

51:41.333 --> 51:45.540
our gaze is fixed
on the distant future of this city

51:45.541 --> 51:48.208
and the entire nation.

51:49.625 --> 51:53.041
What we must do and sacrifice--

51:58.791 --> 52:01.124
Hit me as many times as you want!

52:01.125 --> 52:02.625
All right, Sakata?!

52:05.791 --> 52:08.750
I pledged my loyalty to our master

52:09.500 --> 52:15.374
and swore I'd devote
my body and soul to a better world.

52:15.375 --> 52:18.291
Do you understand
what that means, Sakata?!

52:27.125 --> 52:29.291
MASTER

52:31.041 --> 52:34.166
That's who you'll want to meet
most of all.

52:41.791 --> 52:43.583
<i>Is that you, Sakata?</i>

52:44.416 --> 52:45.707
<i>I've been waiting.</i>

52:45.708 --> 52:48.707
Master, I didn't tell him anything.

52:48.708 --> 52:51.165
Please rest assured, I never--

52:51.166 --> 52:52.875
I know.

52:54.333 --> 52:55.333
Thanks.

52:56.375 --> 52:57.332
Sakata,

52:57.333 --> 52:59.915
<i>enough of this senseless slaughter.</i>

52:59.916 --> 53:04.250
<i>- I need Takemoto, the guy you have there.</i>
- No, don't!

53:07.583 --> 53:09.165
<i>Hey, hey, hey.</i>

53:09.166 --> 53:14.375
<i>Keep this up, and you'll kill
every last person in Shinjo.</i>

53:14.916 --> 53:21.082
The people of this city survive
thanks to the money we earn.

53:21.083 --> 53:28.166
This world is a little more complicated
than you think.

53:30.333 --> 53:32.125
<i>By the way, Sakata</i>...

53:34.208 --> 53:35.375
<i>your daughter</i>...

53:37.375 --> 53:38.625
<i>is still alive.</i>

53:43.250 --> 53:48.041
<i>She's living the ordinary but happy life
of a high school student.</i>

53:53.083 --> 53:54.125
However...

53:57.666 --> 54:01.208
if you continue this petty vendetta,

54:02.833 --> 54:06.666
imagine what we'll do
to your precious daughter.

54:09.166 --> 54:11.958
Ponder that with your tiny pea brain,

54:13.166 --> 54:14.208
<i>Sakata.</i>

54:15.791 --> 54:16.750
<i>Daddy!</i>

54:23.833 --> 54:27.250
Now, release me,

54:28.208 --> 54:32.458
or else your precious daughter will be...

55:12.916 --> 55:13.875
Ryo.

55:32.333 --> 55:36.207
<i>Shinjo City was struck
by a series of terror attacks last night</i>

55:36.208 --> 55:38.875
<i>ahead of the preparations
for next year's opening</i>

55:39.625 --> 55:42.583
<i>of the integrated resort Mahoroba.</i>

55:43.166 --> 55:47.249
<i>Around 7:00 p.m. yesterday,
a doctor and three police officers</i>

55:47.250 --> 55:50.291
<i>were murdered
at Shinjo City General Hospital.</i>

55:52.583 --> 55:56.749
<i>Then the Shinjo Cleaning System
disposal plant was destroyed by a bomb.</i>

55:56.750 --> 56:02.332
<i>The suspect, Shuhei Sakata,
has been confirmed dead</i>

56:02.333 --> 56:05.625
<i>after being caught in the blast.</i>

56:07.666 --> 56:10.499
<i>The police are looking into
the suspect's motives</i>

56:10.500 --> 56:12.291
<i>and how the crime transpired.</i>

56:14.083 --> 56:19.000
<i>The people of this city
no doubt had a very uneasy night.</i>

56:20.125 --> 56:24.040
<i>Working with police,
we have already started analyzing</i>

56:24.041 --> 56:27.541
<i>the suspect's actions
leading up to last night.</i>

56:29.458 --> 56:32.249
<i>Shinjo City is on the brink</i>

56:32.250 --> 56:36.999
<i>of difficult challenges
unlike anything before.</i>

56:37.000 --> 56:39.249
- Morning.
- Morning.

56:39.250 --> 56:43.874
<i>I see this as a sign that this city
is facing some major changes</i>...

56:43.875 --> 56:48.082
- Things are getting out of hand.
- Yeah.

56:48.083 --> 56:50.665
<i>I'll strive to overcome such difficulties...</i>

56:50.666 --> 56:51.583
Crap!

57:08.583 --> 57:10.583
- Practice?
- Yeah.

57:11.166 --> 57:13.750
You didn't come home last night, did you?

57:15.666 --> 57:17.875
I put last night's leftovers
in the fridge.

57:18.916 --> 57:20.958
- Go for it if you get hungry.
- Thanks.

57:25.000 --> 57:27.707
INCOMING CALL
MASTER

57:27.708 --> 57:30.165
- Can you do the dishes?
- Sure.

57:30.166 --> 57:32.040
Oh no.

57:32.041 --> 57:33.707
Ryo, be careful!

57:33.708 --> 57:34.791
I will!

57:42.500 --> 57:43.416
Sir?

57:45.208 --> 57:47.583
When will you find Sakata?

57:48.416 --> 57:50.124
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

57:50.125 --> 57:55.791
We'll all keep searching,
including the possibility he left Shinjo.

57:56.458 --> 58:00.875
Sakata is in Shinjo.
There is no way he's left.

58:02.416 --> 58:03.333
Right.

58:04.500 --> 58:07.166
<i>- He'll be furious.</i>
- Good morning.

58:08.041 --> 58:12.249
<i>Especially when he finds out
his daughter is being kept alive</i>

58:12.250 --> 58:14.750
<i>for your own pleasure.</i>

58:16.083 --> 58:17.666
I'll find him at all costs.

58:18.708 --> 58:19.750
<i>You do that.</i>

58:43.916 --> 58:47.207
SHINJO POLICE

58:47.208 --> 58:49.041
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

59:08.666 --> 59:10.375
I'm home.

59:18.500 --> 59:19.541
Why's that open?

59:36.958 --> 59:38.250
No way.

59:41.333 --> 59:43.833
It's been ages, Mr. Sakata.

59:49.958 --> 59:53.208
I ended up working at a police substation.

59:54.166 --> 59:55.541
It's a long story.

59:56.541 --> 01:00:01.749
So it's not as easy to provide you
with information like I used to.

01:00:01.750 --> 01:00:04.707
But take a look at this.

01:00:04.708 --> 01:00:08.375
See him? That's Shinozuka,
the guy you killed at the hospital.

01:00:09.625 --> 01:00:13.000
I worked directly under him.

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:16.583
He often took me out for drinks
and stuff back then.

01:00:18.625 --> 01:00:20.208
He treated me well.

01:00:22.250 --> 01:00:27.290
He was all revved up when he was young,
saying he'd protect the people.

01:00:27.291 --> 01:00:29.291
We were both like that.

01:00:34.083 --> 01:00:35.125
Look at her.

01:00:35.625 --> 01:00:38.208
This was his wife.

01:00:38.791 --> 01:00:39.791
Hiromi.

01:00:40.750 --> 01:00:45.333
She was classy and modest.
Way too good for him.

01:00:55.666 --> 01:00:56.833
Don't be so nosy.

01:01:01.041 --> 01:01:02.666
According to Hiromi,

01:01:04.125 --> 01:01:08.500
Shinozuka occasionally snuck out
of the house in the middle of the night.

01:01:09.333 --> 01:01:11.415
She said, "I bet he's cheating."

01:01:11.416 --> 01:01:15.875
So I hired a detective to tail him.

01:01:17.125 --> 01:01:21.750
I was like, "We can be together
once we get the evidence."

01:01:26.666 --> 01:01:28.874
Okay, watch this part carefully.

01:01:28.875 --> 01:01:29.958
<i>I'm scared.</i>

01:01:30.625 --> 01:01:33.457
<i>I'm begging you. Please don't!</i>

01:01:33.458 --> 01:01:34.541
Bang.

01:01:38.291 --> 01:01:39.833
<i>Let me go!</i>

01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:43.041
Bang.

01:01:44.041 --> 01:01:45.125
Then there's this.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.458
Shinozuka gave it to me a few days later.

01:01:54.625 --> 01:01:55.625
Any guesses?

01:01:56.666 --> 01:01:58.125
Hiromi's finger.

01:01:59.250 --> 01:02:02.916
He said, "Hands off my wife."
Then gave me this.

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:06.041
I couldn't believe it.

01:02:07.875 --> 01:02:08.875
Look at it.

01:02:10.250 --> 01:02:11.875
The nail polish is peeling.

01:02:15.625 --> 01:02:17.958
That detective also went missing.

01:02:23.833 --> 01:02:27.582
The guy who got shot
was the CEO of the security company

01:02:27.583 --> 01:02:31.875
that handled most of the public facilities
in this area back then.

01:02:37.500 --> 01:02:40.874
After he was killed,
no one batted an eyelash

01:02:40.875 --> 01:02:45.125
when Shinjo Security
took over security for Mahoroba.

01:03:04.083 --> 01:03:05.000
Stop right there!

01:03:06.166 --> 01:03:08.291
Hey, stop! Wait!

01:05:04.541 --> 01:05:06.166
Who on earth are you?

01:05:10.833 --> 01:05:13.750
We have money to spare.
No need for violence.

01:05:17.708 --> 01:05:18.833
What have you done?

01:05:19.666 --> 01:05:21.000
What do you mean?

01:05:23.541 --> 01:05:24.541
Ryo...

01:05:28.041 --> 01:05:29.750
what did you do to her?

01:06:18.500 --> 01:06:19.916
Get off me, asshole!

01:06:23.500 --> 01:06:25.166
<i>Get off me, asshole!</i>

01:06:34.375 --> 01:06:35.208
Huh?

01:06:40.208 --> 01:06:41.208
Dad!

01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:50.375
Ryo.

01:07:14.916 --> 01:07:17.041
Ryo, are you all right?

01:07:18.541 --> 01:07:19.625
Are you all right?

01:07:51.583 --> 01:07:55.124
You ran amok at the hospital
and the disposal plant.

01:07:55.125 --> 01:07:58.583
Then you stormed that building alone
and got hit by an arrow.

01:07:59.166 --> 01:08:00.541
You're insane.

01:08:04.875 --> 01:08:06.625
Don't hurt my daddy!

01:08:26.625 --> 01:08:28.166
Hang in there.

01:08:28.750 --> 01:08:30.332
I'm gonna pull it out.

01:08:30.333 --> 01:08:31.250
Ready?

01:08:32.250 --> 01:08:33.583
One, two, three!

01:08:35.208 --> 01:08:36.583
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:08:38.916 --> 01:08:42.124
I won't let you die.
I owe you my life after all.

01:08:42.125 --> 01:08:44.375
It's my turn to save yours.

01:08:45.958 --> 01:08:47.500
Now to apply pressure.

01:08:53.208 --> 01:08:54.291
An unknown number?

01:08:55.833 --> 01:08:57.082
Hello?

01:08:57.083 --> 01:08:59.500
<i>Officer Yoshifumi Takigawa.</i>

01:09:01.375 --> 01:09:02.375
Who's this?

01:09:03.791 --> 01:09:06.250
<i>I heard you used to work under Shinozuka.</i>

01:09:07.750 --> 01:09:08.833
<i>That's right.</i>

01:09:09.916 --> 01:09:11.750
<i>Put Sakata on.</i>

01:09:15.250 --> 01:09:16.625
It's for you.

01:09:21.416 --> 01:09:25.333
<i>How was it seeing your daughter
after so long?</i>

01:09:27.458 --> 01:09:29.541
She has grown up, hasn't she?

01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:37.250
If you ever want to see her alive again...

01:09:41.125 --> 01:09:42.708
come to Mahoroba.

01:09:45.833 --> 01:09:47.458
I'll be waiting.

01:09:53.541 --> 01:09:55.250
You're in no shape to move.

01:09:57.916 --> 01:09:59.916
Wait. You're gonna drive?

01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:01.666
Whoa!

01:10:02.250 --> 01:10:03.250
No, don't.

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.791
This is a bad idea.

01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:48.208
Whoa.

01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:51.291
You've been living here?

01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:05.666
Delta One, one car.

01:14:02.500 --> 01:14:03.333
Shoot him!

01:16:55.750 --> 01:16:56.750
Fucking die!

01:17:03.416 --> 01:17:06.208
You had to come back from the dead?

01:17:07.333 --> 01:17:12.416
Just when Ryo's body started to blossom.

01:17:14.250 --> 01:17:16.541
Curves in all the right places.

01:17:20.791 --> 01:17:21.708
Goddammit!

01:17:22.208 --> 01:17:23.458
You pain in the ass!

01:17:45.666 --> 01:17:49.000
Ryo is... mine.

01:17:52.666 --> 01:17:53.833
She's mine.

01:17:54.833 --> 01:17:57.625
I raised her.

01:18:22.541 --> 01:18:25.791
Ryo!

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:38.666
Ryo.

01:19:53.333 --> 01:19:54.541
Don't you recognize me?

01:20:00.708 --> 01:20:02.083
Daddy is...

01:20:37.958 --> 01:20:39.291
So we meet again,

01:20:40.958 --> 01:20:41.958
Sakata.

01:20:50.666 --> 01:20:55.958
This place has long been known
as The City of Demonic Possession.

01:20:58.458 --> 01:21:00.791
There's a demon in Shinjo.

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.250
You learn that at school?

01:21:11.541 --> 01:21:12.541
No?

01:21:17.458 --> 01:21:19.416
I see.

01:21:21.708 --> 01:21:25.207
Glossing over our local legends

01:21:25.208 --> 01:21:27.500
is a terrible idea.

01:21:29.250 --> 01:21:32.333
I must give the Board of Education
a stern lecture.

01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:35.000
Nevertheless,

01:21:36.375 --> 01:21:39.583
I may speak of demons,

01:21:40.791 --> 01:21:46.375
but I've never actually seen one myself.

01:21:47.916 --> 01:21:50.208
I'd like to, at least once.

01:21:54.125 --> 01:21:55.583
But somehow...

01:21:57.958 --> 01:22:01.291
you don't quite look like a demon yet.

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:06.916
Please.

01:22:08.791 --> 01:22:09.958
Don't do it.

01:22:12.791 --> 01:22:14.458
Now, Sakata...

01:22:18.041 --> 01:22:20.208
become the demon you are.

01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:37.750
Ryo!

01:22:42.291 --> 01:22:44.875
Ryo, run!

01:22:55.500 --> 01:22:56.791
Run!

01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.250
Come on!

01:25:46.791 --> 01:25:47.791
Does it hurt?

01:25:50.291 --> 01:25:51.541
Poor thing.

01:26:05.250 --> 01:26:06.083
Ryu,

01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:10.291
this is your twin brother,

01:26:11.083 --> 01:26:12.041
Jin.

01:26:13.625 --> 01:26:18.291
You must always support each other,
come what may.

01:27:15.208 --> 01:27:16.208
Whoa!

01:27:17.291 --> 01:27:18.416
This is crazy.

01:27:21.750 --> 01:27:22.750
They're all dead.

01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:25.750
All right, let's go.

01:27:32.291 --> 01:27:33.166
Daddy...

01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:44.333
Huh? Where are you going?

01:27:49.875 --> 01:27:51.750
You're on your own.

01:28:03.166 --> 01:28:07.166
<i>They say there's a demon here in Shinjo.</i>

01:28:08.166 --> 01:28:14.500
Word is, it possesses someone in this city
once every 50 years,

01:28:15.458 --> 01:28:18.375
and they go on a killing spree.

01:28:19.500 --> 01:28:25.041
We must protect this city from that demon.

01:28:38.833 --> 01:28:39.958
Now, then.

01:28:41.708 --> 01:28:43.208
Time to slay the demon.

01:30:51.125 --> 01:30:52.166
So...

01:30:54.958 --> 01:30:56.041
you really are...

01:31:01.791 --> 01:31:02.708
You're...

01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:06.583
the demon of Shinjo!

01:33:22.625 --> 01:33:23.750
Ryo!

01:33:28.166 --> 01:33:29.750
What a relief.

01:33:30.750 --> 01:33:31.916
Are you okay?

01:33:37.458 --> 01:33:38.458
What's wrong?

01:33:40.916 --> 01:33:42.250
Ryo,

01:33:43.416 --> 01:33:44.666
what is it?

01:33:49.500 --> 01:33:50.500
This isn't right.

01:33:52.416 --> 01:33:55.083
What isn't right?

01:33:56.083 --> 01:33:57.250
You...

01:34:00.125 --> 01:34:02.665
You killed my mom.

01:34:02.666 --> 01:34:03.916
Ryo!

01:34:04.666 --> 01:34:07.083
I'm your father. I'd never...

01:34:25.416 --> 01:34:26.375
Daddy.

01:34:30.583 --> 01:34:33.000
Daddy, don't die on me!

01:34:38.875 --> 01:34:39.875
Ryo...

01:34:44.375 --> 01:34:45.583
your mom...

01:34:47.708 --> 01:34:49.833
I couldn't protect her.

01:34:53.291 --> 01:34:54.166
Forgive me.

01:35:29.166 --> 01:35:32.041
You're all grown up now.

01:35:41.833 --> 01:35:43.875
You've grown up.

01:35:52.291 --> 01:35:56.166
Daddy, don't die on me!

01:36:01.375 --> 01:36:02.875
Daddy!

01:36:04.458 --> 01:36:05.583
No.

01:36:06.583 --> 01:36:08.083
Don't die.

01:36:11.833 --> 01:36:12.875
No.

01:36:17.916 --> 01:36:19.750
Daddy!

01:36:42.333 --> 01:36:44.416
Please wait right here.

01:38:01.708 --> 01:38:04.875
ONE YEAR LATER

01:38:18.833 --> 01:38:23.208
Mr. Mayor, congratulations
on your decisive reelection win.

01:38:23.833 --> 01:38:26.916
I'd like to thank the people of this city.

01:38:28.208 --> 01:38:32.375
Last year, there was
a string of unfortunate events.

01:38:33.583 --> 01:38:36.707
I, too, felt deeply responsible.

01:38:36.708 --> 01:38:40.374
But I heard that you confronted the killer

01:38:40.375 --> 01:38:45.415
despite you yourself
sustaining serious injuries.

01:38:45.416 --> 01:38:46.500
That's right.

01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:50.833
Perhaps it was my martial arts training.

01:38:52.458 --> 01:38:54.458
I didn't think twice.

01:38:56.291 --> 01:38:57.208
I just...

01:39:06.125 --> 01:39:12.291
Mahoroba is finally going to open
after all the delays.

01:39:13.583 --> 01:39:17.125
Yes. People from around the world
are gathering in Shinjo City.

01:39:18.083 --> 01:39:22.333
This town will be Japan's pride and joy.

01:39:25.250 --> 01:39:29.833
That was the dearest wish
of all our city's stakeholders

01:39:30.583 --> 01:39:33.666
who died
in that horrific series of events.

01:45:55.791 --> 01:46:00.375
