- Lawyers are a Kitchen classic.
- [Karen] Yeah.

01:06.500 --> 01:09.625
Hey, I like to think that I...
We have evolved.

01:14.250 --> 01:16.749
- You know, uh, Becky's Diner on 8th?
- Love that place.

01:16.750 --> 01:17.916
- Closed.
- [groans]

01:17.917 --> 01:19.582
They're turning it into a SoulCycle.

You're evil for even telling me that!

[sizzles]

01:26.708 --> 01:29.332
- Dark times. Dark times, indeed.
- [chuckles]

01:29.333 --> 01:32.416
These Hell's Kitchen nostalgia
is running pretty thin with you guys.

01:32.417 --> 01:33.707
- You realize that, right?
- [laughs]

01:33.708 --> 01:35.582
Not nostalgia. Reverence for the past...

01:35.583 --> 01:37.082
- [scoffs]
- ...yet hope for the future.

01:37.083 --> 01:40.916
Oh, that is some next level
closing argument BS right there.

01:40.917 --> 01:42.000
Too much?

01:45.583 --> 01:48.041
Nostalgia or not,
it's hard to believe Cherry's retiring.

01:48.042 --> 01:49.582
So many retiring, leaving.

01:49.583 --> 01:52.249
I mean, it's 30% of the force
in the last two years.

01:52.250 --> 01:53.582
Are those numbers legit?

01:53.583 --> 01:55.416
Uh, my numbers
are always legit. [sighs]

01:55.417 --> 01:56.750
Well, I wouldn't argue with her.

01:57.500 --> 02:01.125
Still, the city finds other ways
to protect itself.

02:06.292 --> 02:07.792
[indistinct conversation]

02:13.875 --> 02:15.625
[Karen] Well,
we could just get out of here.

02:16.250 --> 02:17.249
- [Matt] You and me?
- Yeah.

02:17.250 --> 02:20.874
Sounds nice. Although, I think that's
a distinct violation of the friends code.

02:20.875 --> 02:24.416
[clicks tongue] Ah, the friends code.
I keep forgetting about the friends code.

02:24.417 --> 02:25.624
- Mm-hmm.
- [Karen clicks tongue]

02:25.625 --> 02:27.374
- "No one's above the law."
- Nope.

02:27.375 --> 02:29.542
- [chuckles]
- Certainly not you, Miss Page.

02:31.250 --> 02:34.207
Tell me you're gonna do something soulful

02:34.208 --> 02:37.458
- like walk the earth, having adventures.
- [sighs]

02:38.167 --> 02:41.457
Well, I'm thinkin' about restoring
a farmhouse upstate.

02:41.458 --> 02:42.542
Or that.

02:44.000 --> 02:47.207
So, shoot me straight,
why the hell are you quitting?

02:47.208 --> 02:49.832
Hey, excuse me. It's called retirement.

02:49.833 --> 02:51.957
Uh, it's quitting and you know it.

02:51.958 --> 02:54.416
I hear you were at a real firm once.

02:54.417 --> 02:55.749
- I was.
- Mm-hmm.

02:55.750 --> 02:57.332
Hogarth, Chao & Benowitz.

02:57.333 --> 02:59.542
It's on my list for when I leave the DA's.

03:00.167 --> 03:01.792
Ambition. I like that.

03:02.458 --> 03:04.041
Then why are you in a storefront?

03:04.042 --> 03:05.124
[chuckling] Jesus.

03:05.125 --> 03:07.416
- Remind me never to face you in cross.
- [chuckles]

03:07.417 --> 03:08.500
Question stands.

03:09.167 --> 03:13.542
I'm... in a storefront
because it's... real.

03:14.583 --> 03:17.166
And I happen to like most of the people
I represent.

03:17.167 --> 03:20.082
All that experience,
you're taking it off the street.

03:20.083 --> 03:21.791
You're gonna miss this shit.

03:21.792 --> 03:25.249
Am I? Daredevil. White Tiger.

03:25.250 --> 03:27.499
- They're the future. We're obsolete.
- [Angie] Oh.

03:27.500 --> 03:29.999
Spare me the dinosaur's lament.

03:30.000 --> 03:31.999
We're the thin blue line, not them.

03:32.000 --> 03:34.957
We get sued and they get cheered.

03:34.958 --> 03:37.582
Way I see it,
the vigilantes are just like us.

03:37.583 --> 03:40.207
Some are stand-up human beings
worthy of the gig,

03:40.208 --> 03:42.749
others are just power-tripping assholes.

03:42.750 --> 03:45.792
You might have a point there,
Detective Kim.

03:47.625 --> 03:49.874
- Next round on me. Josie!
- [Angie] Oh.

03:49.875 --> 03:52.958
Keep your cash. Tonight you're crime.
You don't pay.

03:56.792 --> 03:58.332
To Cherry!

03:58.333 --> 04:00.916
May you be in heaven a full half hour

04:05.500 --> 04:06.957
What about Dumb Benny?

04:06.958 --> 04:08.874
Oh, God. You heard about that, huh?

04:08.875 --> 04:10.291
Everyone has heard about that.

04:10.292 --> 04:12.082
The guy rips off a bonded warehouse,

04:12.083 --> 04:14.667
gets caught on surveillance,
and then he tells the cops he found...

04:15.375 --> 04:18.374
20 cases of Lafite Rothschild
on the subway?

04:18.375 --> 04:20.457
Benny is a unique individual.

04:20.458 --> 04:21.999
- Benny is an idiot.
- [chuckles]

04:22.000 --> 04:23.541
He's gonna walk, you know?

04:23.542 --> 04:25.125
Well, you sound confident.

04:25.958 --> 04:26.957
What's your game plan?

04:26.958 --> 04:29.957
I'll keep my strategy to myself.
Thank you very much.

04:29.958 --> 04:31.082
Mm-hmm.

04:31.083 --> 04:33.249
Fifty bucks says I can worm it out of you

04:33.250 --> 04:34.624

04:34.625 --> 04:35.916
- Not a chance.

of 20-year-old O'Melveny's behind the bar.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.792
- Really?
- Really.

04:42.833 --> 04:44.583
- [Kirsten] Cheers.
- Cheers.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.042
Oh, my God, he did it.

04:49.750 --> 04:51.332
What? Foggy?

04:51.333 --> 04:52.416

- No!

04:52.417 --> 04:53.708

04:54.417 --> 04:56.541

for Kirsten McDuffie.

- [scoffs]

04:57.667 --> 04:58.999
Don't underestimate our Foggy.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.457
I'm not underestimating her.

05:00.458 --> 05:02.916
- You get soft in public service.
- Oh?

05:02.917 --> 05:07.124
I have learned ninja moves at my time
at N, M, and P.

05:07.125 --> 05:08.291
- Oh, boy.
- [Karen] What?

05:08.292 --> 05:11.749
No. He's calling the firm N, M, and P.

05:11.750 --> 05:14.374
- No! Foggy!
- [laughs]

05:14.375 --> 05:16.749
Oh! [chuckling] Should we rescue him?

05:16.750 --> 05:19.250
Rescue him? Hell no.
I just wish we had popcorn.

- What? I think they're a little...

05:30.000 --> 05:32.749
- What's wrong with these bad boys?
- I just think they're a little dated.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.082

- Yeah.

[Foggy] Yeah, it's-- it's Benny.

After that thing in Red Hook,

06:37.708 --> 06:40.208
he said he was getting threats,
so I stashed him.

06:41.750 --> 06:43.583
[Matt] You stashed him? [chuckles]

06:43.708 --> 06:45.541
How exactly are you stashing people?

06:45.542 --> 06:48.124
He's at my apartment.
It's just down the street.

06:50.208 --> 06:52.832
It's a secure building, Benny.
You're safe.

06:52.833 --> 06:54.541
Guy's paranoid. He's probably high.

06:54.542 --> 06:57.749
He doesn't sound high. Wh-Why didn't
you tell me about the threats?

it was Benny being Benny.

My name is Wilson Fisk.</i>

[Fisk] <i>But I have seen it decline
into chaos and lawlessness.</i>

31:47.167 --> 31:49.667
<i>Vigilantes, they run rampant.</i>

31:50.500 --> 31:52.000
<i>Good cops are afraid.</i>

31:52.625 --> 31:55.167
<i>Bad cops, well, they just don't care.</i>

31:56.500 --> 31:59.333
<i>The city, the streets...</i>

32:00.583 --> 32:03.042
<i>It's no longer safe for decent people.</i>

32:05.250 --> 32:10.167
<i>Tonight, I'm making a commitment
to fix the system, to fix our city.</i>

32:11.750 --> 32:15.999
<i>Tonight, I'm declaring my candidacy
for Mayor of New York.</i>

[sizzling continues]

[smoke alarm beeping]

32:31.708 --> 32:35.833
You're still behind Roger Cressna
and Diana Montoya, but that's expected.

32:36.500 --> 32:40.208
We need to refine your message points
for the debate.

32:41.167 --> 32:43.207
[Fisk] My message is very clear.

32:43.208 --> 32:46.082
If your polls are as good as you say,

32:46.083 --> 32:50.458
then neither Mr. Fisk
nor his candidacy needs... refining.

32:51.458 --> 32:54.707
Sir, I've been doing this a long time.

32:54.708 --> 32:57.374
And I understand that some of your ideas

32:57.375 --> 33:01.666
and staff are refreshingly unconventional,

33:01.667 --> 33:03.541
but we are a dark horse in this race and--

33:03.542 --> 33:07.041
Uh... I'm sorry. Sorry. He-- He's right.

33:07.042 --> 33:10.416
Look, I've been watching the socials,
and everyone is talkin' about you.

33:10.417 --> 33:11.749
You're even in <i>The BB Report,</i>

33:11.750 --> 33:13.416
and you're blowin' up, sir.

33:13.417 --> 33:18.707
I mean, lotta engagement, lotta depth,
lotta spread, people sharin' memes.

33:18.708 --> 33:22.000
I mean, "Fisk can fix it"
is trending hard.

33:23.000 --> 33:25.083
We should not change a thing.

33:27.750 --> 33:32.500
I just wanna say that I am so stoked
to put you over the top.

33:33.500 --> 33:35.333
If we could get back to the agenda...

33:40.333 --> 33:41.750
What's your name, son?

33:42.500 --> 33:44.582
Daniel. Daniel Blake.

33:44.583 --> 33:45.667
Daniel.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.583
I'm impressed with your enthusiasm.

33:50.208 --> 33:53.167
Tell me, you're a young person
living in the city here.

33:55.250 --> 33:56.666
Why would you vote for me?

33:56.667 --> 33:58.499
Straight up? 'Cause you get shit done.

33:58.500 --> 33:59.999
You made things happen for yourself,

34:00.000 --> 34:01.749
now you'll make things happen
for New York.

34:01.750 --> 34:04.292
And, I mean... [chuckling] Mayor Fisk?

34:05.000 --> 34:07.000
That's the coolest fuckin' thing
on the planet.

34:12.917 --> 34:14.542
Where did you find him, Sheila?

34:15.125 --> 34:19.708
He canvassed 2,000 signatures for us.
And he was cheap, sir.

34:21.708 --> 34:22.708
Yeah.

34:30.125 --> 34:31.125
- Sorry.
- [Sheila] Mm.

34:34.250 --> 34:35.333
So stoked.

34:36.208 --> 34:37.207
[Kirsten] <i>You busy?</i>

34:37.208 --> 34:39.291
No, no, I was just goin' over
the Madison charges.

34:39.292 --> 34:40.374
Oh.

34:40.375 --> 34:42.166
You know, your boy might
actually be a moron.

34:42.167 --> 34:44.666
[chuckles] He's not my boy,
and Madison is rich,

34:44.667 --> 34:46.791
- so we call him a "savant."
- [chuckles]

34:46.792 --> 34:49.207
Hey, remember, you've got that
client meeting this afternoon?

34:49.208 --> 34:51.166
I'd do it myself,
but I've got this deposition.

34:51.167 --> 34:52.457
Oh, yeah, right. Uh, remind me.

34:52.458 --> 34:55.457
Heather Glenn. Doctor in Tribeca.

34:55.458 --> 34:58.082
- Right. Malpractice?
- Um...

34:58.083 --> 35:01.082
We didn't get that far. Can you just
meet her, see if we're the right fit?

35:01.083 --> 35:04.208
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure.
- Great. 3:30. Uh, Manhattanville Coffee.

35:08.875 --> 35:12.624
[man 1] Our friends are assholes.
So, yeah, there's something about Fisk,

35:12.625 --> 35:15.166
I mean, I haven't voted
for mayor in, like, forever.

35:15.167 --> 35:17.874
[woman 1 scoffs] Please, me either.
So are you gonna watch tonight?

35:17.875 --> 35:20.667
[man 1] Hell yeah, I'm watchin'
the debate. At least Fisk is interesting.

35:21.750 --> 35:23.082
[woman 2] Fisk will shake things up.

35:23.083 --> 35:25.667
[man 2] Why would anyone vote for Fisk?
He's a crook!

35:26.875 --> 35:28.875
[man speaking Spanish over radio]

35:31.125 --> 35:33.832
- [man 3 in English] Not on your life.
- [man 4] We're going to clear the street.

35:33.833 --> 35:35.208
[man 5] Fisk ain't afraid of nobody.

35:51.500 --> 35:54.749
- Uh, Matt Murdock?
- Dr. Glenn? Hi, nice to meet you.

35:54.750 --> 35:59.082
Um... Uh, Kirsten's sorry she couldn't
make it, but you're in good hands with me.

35:59.083 --> 36:01.624
I don't usually meet
in coffee shops like this,

36:01.625 --> 36:03.958
- but, uh, anything for Kirsten.
- Right. [chuckles]

36:04.750 --> 36:07.874
I'm glad she connected us.
We go way back.

36:07.875 --> 36:08.999
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

36:09.000 --> 36:10.999
I used to consult on some of her cases

36:11.000 --> 36:12.874
when she was
at the District Attorney's office.

36:12.875 --> 36:14.583
Oh. She didn't mention it.

36:15.292 --> 36:18.791
Uh... Yeah, I faced off against her
a few times myself.

36:18.792 --> 36:21.958
I guess you could say we went
from adversaries to partners. [chuckles]

36:23.042 --> 36:26.124
Um... So, look,
why don't I jump right in and ask

36:26.125 --> 36:28.292
what are you looking for
in legal representation?

36:29.583 --> 36:30.582
Excuse me?

36:30.583 --> 36:32.707
What are you hoping Murdock and McDuffie
can do for you?

36:32.708 --> 36:35.458
Um... [stutters] I'm a little confused.

36:37.167 --> 36:39.957
I was just about to ask you
what you're looking to get out of therapy.

36:39.958 --> 36:43.125
- What?
- Kirsten said that you were...

36:44.125 --> 36:45.541
looking for a therapist.

36:45.542 --> 36:48.457
[chuckles] Ah. Yeah, she told me
you're looking for a lawyer.

36:48.458 --> 36:49.707
Kirsten.

36:49.708 --> 36:52.000
Wow. I can't believe she did that.

36:52.708 --> 36:54.917
- It is kind of funny.
- What a waste of time.

36:55.417 --> 36:57.124
Uh, hey, she did it to both of us.

36:57.125 --> 36:59.332
I'm-- That's what I mean.
I'm saying... It's annoying, yeah.

36:59.333 --> 37:01.249
Yeah, it is very annoying.

37:01.250 --> 37:03.707
Uh, so do you want me to get you
a to-go cup for your coffee?

37:03.708 --> 37:05.000
[stuttering] No, that's fine.

37:05.917 --> 37:08.791
I didn't mean to be rude.
I'm just not sure what she was thinking.

37:08.792 --> 37:10.457
Yeah, she knows I don't date lawyers.

37:10.458 --> 37:11.624
Oh. Really?

37:11.625 --> 37:15.000
Yeah, your hours suck
and you argue everything.

37:16.417 --> 37:19.417
Okay. That's kind of
a sweeping generalization, but...

37:20.417 --> 37:22.125
- See what I mean?
- [laughs]

37:25.375 --> 37:28.624
All right. Please. Heather...

37:28.625 --> 37:32.958
[stutters] Forgive me.
Please sit. I apologize.

37:33.792 --> 37:37.374
I've had a hell of a week.
I am gonna kill Kirsten, though.

37:37.375 --> 37:39.875
Oh, please do. For both of us.

37:42.583 --> 37:44.042
So, you're from Queens, huh?

37:44.708 --> 37:45.707
How did you know?

37:45.708 --> 37:47.541
Uh, your accent's still there.

37:47.542 --> 37:48.916
[clicks tongue] Like hell it is.

37:48.917 --> 37:51.291
It's there. You've worked
to shorten the A's and the O's

37:51.292 --> 37:52.958
but you can still hear the effort.

37:54.083 --> 37:56.916
It's slight, but it's there.
Don't feel bad, uh, it's a blind thing.

37:56.917 --> 37:59.375
[chuckles] That's... Wow.

38:02.500 --> 38:04.082
- So where're you from?
- 37th and 8th.

38:04.083 --> 38:06.582
- Hell's Kitchen. Tough guy?
- Mm-hmm. [chuckles]

38:06.583 --> 38:08.124
Not at all.

38:08.125 --> 38:09.792
You been to the Kitchen lately?

38:10.750 --> 38:12.082
Now, Queens, that's rough.

38:12.083 --> 38:14.582
[laughs] Um, you been to Queens lately?

38:14.583 --> 38:18.000
[chuckles] Yeah,
only for Sal, Kris & Charlie's.

38:19.625 --> 38:21.999
The lawyer from the Kitchen's
got good taste in sandwiches.

38:22.000 --> 38:23.167
Mm-mm.

38:23.833 --> 38:25.666
- Where did you go to high school?
- Xavier.

38:25.667 --> 38:27.416
[continues indistinctly]

38:27.417 --> 38:29.500
[♪ serene music playing]

38:46.875 --> 38:47.875
Oh. Hey.

38:48.708 --> 38:49.750
So?

38:50.417 --> 38:51.457
That's not funny.

38:51.458 --> 38:55.583
That is inappropriate, it's unethical,
and it's kinda creepy, if I'm honest.

38:56.375 --> 38:57.416
And how did it go?

38:57.417 --> 39:00.749
- [chuckles] You're an insane person.
- No, I'm your friend.

39:00.750 --> 39:03.916
And you need a little something-something,
if you know what I mean. And so does she.

39:03.917 --> 39:06.292
No, I don't know what you mean.
And it was a disaster.

39:07.708 --> 39:09.124
- You liar!
- I'm not lying.

39:09.125 --> 39:11.457
I swear to God,
I can read a vibe with people.

39:11.458 --> 39:13.166
- No, you can't.
- When're you seeing her again?

39:13.167 --> 39:14.749
I'm not having this conversation with you.

39:14.750 --> 39:18.791
Hey! Matt, in all seriousness,
you need this. It's time.

39:18.792 --> 39:21.291
- I-- What--
- Don't mess this up.

39:21.292 --> 39:24.124
- I don't have time for this.
- Cherry's here, in the conference room.

39:24.125 --> 39:25.582
- Are you gonna tell me--
- Right now?

39:25.583 --> 39:28.291
Yeah. You wanna tell me
why you invited your hatchet man?

39:28.292 --> 39:30.541
He's not my hatchet--
He's my investigator.

39:30.542 --> 39:32.917
- [scoffs] Whatever.
- I'm just doing some due diligence.

39:34.667 --> 39:35.791
Stay out of my private life.

39:35.792 --> 39:37.250
That's never gonna happen.

39:38.875 --> 39:40.458
All right, you can text me her number.

39:41.375 --> 39:42.791
Just so I can apologize

39:42.792 --> 39:44.416
- for your inappropriate behavior.
- Uh-huh.

39:44.417 --> 39:45.958
- Yeah.
- [Kirsten chuckles]

39:47.625 --> 39:49.291
- Hey. Thanks for coming.
- [Cherry] Hey.

39:49.292 --> 39:51.541
Yeah, I'd have done it
even if you hadn't asked me.

39:51.542 --> 39:52.707
Talked to a lotta people.

39:52.708 --> 39:55.917
Half the cops hate Fisk's guts,
the other half would...

39:56.583 --> 39:58.374
dive off the Chrysler Building for him.

39:58.375 --> 40:00.958
- What about the campaign?
- Completely buttoned up.

40:01.792 --> 40:05.499
Every dollar accounted for,
every income source, absolutely clean.

40:05.500 --> 40:08.791
He came in late, and he came in with
a lotta cash and it's workin' for him.

40:08.792 --> 40:10.208
They say his wife is some kinda...

40:11.042 --> 40:14.082
[sighs] ...investment sorceress.

40:14.083 --> 40:15.542
[laughs]

40:17.625 --> 40:21.042
Uh, if I didn't know better,
know him better,

40:22.250 --> 40:24.000
I'd say he sounds sincere.

40:25.000 --> 40:27.582
Like maybe he wants to actually do
something for the city.

40:27.583 --> 40:29.916
Look who you're talkin' about.
The man crushes every--

40:29.917 --> 40:31.750
I-- I know! You think I don't know?
I know.

40:32.625 --> 40:33.792
[sighs]

40:34.500 --> 40:36.833
Well, if this city
actually elects him, then,

40:38.250 --> 40:41.166
maybe New York's getting
the mayor it deserves.

40:41.167 --> 40:43.041
You ask me,
that's pretty goddamn cynical, Matt.

40:43.042 --> 40:44.333
Hmm.

40:45.083 --> 40:46.625
Or maybe I'm just wisin' up.

40:48.625 --> 40:50.041
So, you want me to go on with this?

40:50.042 --> 40:52.792
No, let it go. It's not our job.

40:54.167 --> 40:55.666
I mean, you could--

40:55.667 --> 40:57.250
No, let it go.

40:58.500 --> 40:59.542
Hey, thanks.

41:00.250 --> 41:01.458
[man] Marker.

41:02.375 --> 41:04.666
[BB] <i>Hi, excuse me, ma'am.
I'm with</i> The BB Report.

41:04.667 --> 41:07.082
- Would you vote for Wilson Fisk?
- He's an animal.

41:07.083 --> 41:12.041
And that sort of person brings out
the worst in other people as well.

41:12.042 --> 41:14.957
Politicians, criminals...
They're all the same breed, man.

41:14.958 --> 41:17.916
Why're we even talking about this?
He supposedly crushed a guy's head.

41:17.917 --> 41:21.208
It's a good rumor, "crushed his head."
I mean, I'd actually like to see that.

41:24.417 --> 41:25.791
[Fisk] <i>It was almost a year ago now</i>

41:25.792 --> 41:29.292
<i>when those cops in that bar
were murdered by a vigilante.</i>

41:30.208 --> 41:32.958
<i>I, myself, have endured
vigilante violence.</i>

41:34.125 --> 41:38.624
<i>And I can assure you there's nothing
nuanced about getting shot.</i>

41:38.625 --> 41:41.041
<i>I have to say, I absolutely agree
with Mr. Fisk here.</i>

41:41.042 --> 41:44.458
<i>Ah, well, you're posing, Cressna.</i> [scoffs]

41:47.417 --> 41:50.124
<i>You propose registering the vigilantes.</i>

41:50.125 --> 41:53.666
<i>That's like making
a grocery list of cancers.</i>

41:53.667 --> 41:55.208
<i>I propose treatment.</i>

41:55.792 --> 41:57.083
[all clamoring]

41:58.583 --> 42:00.124
- All right, step back. Back it up.
- Hello.

42:00.125 --> 42:03.166
- Back it up. Back it up. Back it up.
- Good afternoon.

42:03.167 --> 42:06.292
- Thank you. Thank you very much.
- Step back, sir.

42:08.917 --> 42:10.167
It's okay, Buck.

42:16.833 --> 42:20.958
Well... [sighs] It's been
some time, hasn't it?

42:21.542 --> 42:22.542
It has.

42:23.792 --> 42:26.125
I was wondering
if we could have a little chat.

42:31.042 --> 42:33.417
Yeah. I'd be delighted.

42:34.708 --> 42:35.707
Thank you.

[♪ dramatic music playing]

42:45.875 --> 42:47.625
[Matt] I appreciate you finding this time.

42:48.958 --> 42:51.333
Your, uh, step is lighter.

42:53.375 --> 42:55.708
You've lost some weight. Gained muscle.

42:57.167 --> 42:58.667
Um...

42:58.792 --> 43:00.374
I'm not gonna spar with you, Murdock.

43:00.375 --> 43:02.667
No, no, I wasn't asking you to.

43:06.000 --> 43:07.708
Well, I'll admit, it's not...

43:08.750 --> 43:11.291
entirely unpleasant to see you again.

43:11.292 --> 43:13.832

43:20.000 --> 43:21.124
No. You?

43:21.125 --> 43:24.708
Oh, no. No,
I tried to mentor someone, but...

43:26.250 --> 43:28.167
Well, that's the closest I've come.

43:48.042 --> 43:49.749
You're keeping tabs on me?

43:49.750 --> 43:53.666
No, I'm not. I'm just...
Call it professional curiosity.

43:53.667 --> 43:56.292
Ah. What profession would that be?

43:56.958 --> 43:57.958
I'm a lawyer.

43:59.042 --> 44:01.875
Hmm. I've never been to this place before.

44:02.625 --> 44:04.332
I miss Becky's Diner.

44:04.333 --> 44:05.417
Mmm. Me too.

44:06.708 --> 44:08.749
Yeah, I don't make it
to Hell's Kitchen much these days.

44:08.750 --> 44:09.833
Neither do I.

44:11.250 --> 44:13.582
By the look of it,
you've come up in the world.

44:13.583 --> 44:15.250
I could say the same about you.

44:16.208 --> 44:17.207
[man] Hey, Fisk!

44:17.208 --> 44:18.292
- Thank you.
- [man] Yeah!

44:24.583 --> 44:26.124
You're a real man of the people now.

44:26.125 --> 44:29.332
A rich man,
by his very nature, is self-serving.

44:29.333 --> 44:31.499
A mayor, a mayor serves his city.

44:31.500 --> 44:32.625
Ah.

44:34.125 --> 44:36.041
You don't seem entirely convinced.

44:36.042 --> 44:37.582
[Matt] Can you blame me?

44:37.583 --> 44:40.416
Considering you've tried to kill me
a few times over the years.

44:40.417 --> 44:41.499
As you have.

44:41.500 --> 44:43.957
No. No. Incarcerate, maybe.

44:43.958 --> 44:45.624
Kill? Never.

44:45.625 --> 44:47.874
I wonder if your darker half would agree.

44:47.875 --> 44:49.291
That part of my life is over.

44:49.292 --> 44:52.333
Mmm. Well, tragedy can transform a man.

44:55.375 --> 44:57.125
[smacks lips] About your friend...

44:58.917 --> 45:01.667
I had nothing to do with his death.
I kept that promise.

45:04.083 --> 45:05.167
Hmm.

45:05.833 --> 45:07.291
But now, the Kingpin is back.

45:07.292 --> 45:09.625
No. No, he's not.

45:10.500 --> 45:12.167
My time away, I...

45:13.167 --> 45:14.208
Well...

45:15.417 --> 45:17.666
Let's say I followed
a road less travelled,

45:17.667 --> 45:19.957
and at its end, I found a new man.

45:19.958 --> 45:21.457
The mayor of New York.

45:21.458 --> 45:22.542
Hmm, soon.

45:23.250 --> 45:24.917
So, answer me this.

45:25.750 --> 45:28.708
Why is it I can't shake the feeling
that you're gaming the system?

45:29.875 --> 45:33.666
Things are not good out there.
You can see that, can't you?

45:33.667 --> 45:35.500
New York's what it's always been.

45:36.417 --> 45:39.791
With a few... unsettling exceptions.

45:39.792 --> 45:40.875
Hmm.

45:42.042 --> 45:45.500
Well, I'm gonna make
New York a better future.

45:50.750 --> 45:52.749
Why did you stop being a vigilante?

45:52.750 --> 45:55.708
- Vigilante is a loaded word.
- It's the parlance of our time.

45:58.500 --> 46:00.083
My best friend was killed.

46:01.542 --> 46:03.875
A line was crossed. [breathes deeply]

46:05.042 --> 46:07.125
I felt like I lost the privilege.

46:08.333 --> 46:10.332
And despite the good that I was doing,

46:10.333 --> 46:13.374
I was... causing damage.

46:13.375 --> 46:17.250
I was told you tried to kill
Benjamin Poindexter that night.

46:22.917 --> 46:24.292
It's hard.

46:27.042 --> 46:30.167
It's hard to come to terms
with a violent nature.

46:31.375 --> 46:34.625
Hating the power that it has over us.

46:35.250 --> 46:37.875
I was raised to believe in grace.

46:39.333 --> 46:44.333
That we can be touched by the divine
and transformed into a better person.

46:46.375 --> 46:49.999
So if you say to me that you're a new man,

46:50.000 --> 46:51.333
I say, "Fine."

46:54.875 --> 46:58.042
But you should know, I was also raised
to believe in retribution.

47:00.417 --> 47:02.542
So if you step out of line,

47:04.042 --> 47:05.250
I will be there.

47:14.500 --> 47:18.083
This caution that you're giving me,
who's it from?

47:19.250 --> 47:20.708
Matt Murdock or...

47:22.083 --> 47:23.208

47:26.417 --> 47:30.041
You liked being on that rooftop with Dex.

47:30.042 --> 47:32.292
You liked how it felt, didn't you?

47:33.208 --> 47:36.792
Giving no quarter. Dispensing justice.

47:41.792 --> 47:45.208
Just stay in your lane. I'll do the same.

47:48.583 --> 47:51.583
I'm going to be mayor of this town,

47:52.375 --> 47:57.542
and when I am, I will not tolerate people
running around in silly costumes.

47:59.250 --> 48:01.499
The rule of law will prevail.

48:01.500 --> 48:06.375
And should you go back
to any of your old activities...

48:09.333 --> 48:10.833
there will be consequences.
