02:13.717 --> 02:18.263
Welcome to the Daytona 500,
the Superbowl of motor racing.

02:18.430 --> 02:24.269
Walking onto the grid
is two-time champion Rowdy Burns.

02:24.478 --> 02:30.984
A contender from Pennsylvania,
Aldo Bennedetti.

02:47.876 --> 02:51.213
Gentlemen, start your engines.

03:33.505 --> 03:39.261
Number 43, Richard Petty,
spins to the inside of the track.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.099
Richard Petty is out
of the Daytona 500.

03:44.308 --> 03:48.228
Speaking of people out of the race,
remember Harry Hogge?

03:48.395 --> 03:55.068
His driver, Buddy Bretherton, died
here last year in a fiery crash.

03:58.322 --> 04:01.325
- You're enjoying the good life.
- Yeah.

04:01.533 --> 04:05.579
I never minded spreading a little
fertilizer around now and then.

04:05.746 --> 04:09.249
- How's the truck running?
- Good.

04:09.416 --> 04:14.129
I want you to build me a car.

04:19.009 --> 04:23.972
Everybody knows some car dealer
who can't afford a race team.

04:24.181 --> 04:26.850
No driver will sign with you.

04:27.017 --> 04:31.647
If they wreck one car, you can't
afford to build them another.

04:31.855 --> 04:36.235
No car's going to win without
a driver ... not even mine.

04:36.401 --> 04:39.738
If you built the car,
I'd get a damn driver.

04:43.700 --> 04:50.833
What kind of driver are you going
to find after the season's started?

04:51.041 --> 04:55.838
You can work with him. You can
build a driver like you build a car.

04:56.004 --> 05:00.300
That hound is the best
coon dog I've ever seen.

05:00.467 --> 05:04.721
- And l didn't teach him a thing.
- I've got somebody.

05:04.888 --> 05:09.184
- Take a look at him.
- He doesn't sound like somebody.

05:09.393 --> 05:13.564
Then take a look at nobody.

05:13.730 --> 05:19.820
- Tim, l gave up racing.
- You didn't give up racing.

05:20.028 --> 05:26.994
You quit to avoid an investigation
into Buddy's crash at Daytona.

05:28.370 --> 05:33.333
I talked to NASCAR. lf you come back
there won't be an investigation.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.587
- How did you sell them that deal?
- I'm a hell of a salesman.

05:42.676 --> 05:46.013
Now that's a race car driver.

05:47.181 --> 05:50.767
When's your driver due?

05:53.520 --> 05:57.774
- Your guy runs those Indy types.
- Sprints, mainly.

05:57.941 --> 06:04.740
Two championships, three all-star
wins, seven straight feature wins.

06:06.617 --> 06:11.496
He's a real statistician.
Does he know anything about drivers?

06:17.127 --> 06:21.840
- Harry, where's your driver from?
- Eagle Rock.

06:22.007 --> 06:27.554
- Is that up around Wilkesboro?
- No. Glendale, California.

06:27.721 --> 06:32.518
- He's a Yankee?
- Californians aren't Yankees.

06:32.684 --> 06:37.814
- They're not really anything.
- You said it.

06:52.621 --> 06:57.167
The shocks are right, we're
dialed in. Don't change a thing.

06:59.336 --> 07:05.676
- Hey, you're looking pretty good.
- You're the one looking good.

07:05.843 --> 07:10.889
It hasn't been easy, Harry,
but this bitch is ready to run.

07:11.056 --> 07:16.186
We appreciate you letting us
use the car, Rowdy.

07:17.271 --> 07:22.234
l told you. Harry's got a new driver
and he needs a car for a few laps.

07:22.442 --> 07:26.280
Harry Hogge asked us personally
as a favor.

07:31.410 --> 07:35.080
Who is this driver?.

08:04.860 --> 08:09.823
Tim tells me
you've been running open wheels.

08:10.032 --> 08:14.661
Now you just want
to up and drive NASCAR?

08:14.870 --> 08:20.501
- This is stock car racing.
- I've watched it on television.

08:20.667 --> 08:27.090
- You've seen it on television?
- ESPN, the coverage is excellent.

08:27.257 --> 08:32.304
This may not be the best time
for you to run this car.

08:32.471 --> 08:37.267
- Is there some problem?
- No, sir.

08:37.476 --> 08:42.022
You bend this bitch,
and I'll tear your balls off.

08:51.740 --> 08:56.119
Would you mind very much
holding on to this?

08:56.286 --> 09:00.290
Didn't you hear what that man said?

09:02.459 --> 09:09.508
- Hold on, we ought to talk.
- About how I'm going to run?

09:09.675 --> 09:15.264
About how you've managed to live
so long. You ain't racing this car.

09:23.355 --> 09:27.985
What's going on?
You said you'd look at him.

09:28.151 --> 09:32.072
- I've looked at him.
- l paid $2,500 to use this track.

09:32.239 --> 09:38.829
- Forget it. He needs a brand name.
- l know a driver when l see one.

09:40.164 --> 09:46.503
- Harry, is this happening or what?
- Do us all a favor, Harry.

09:53.010 --> 09:58.056
Let me drive.
l won't make a fool out of you.

10:05.063 --> 10:09.443
That tunnel turn is real tricky.
Hot or cold, it's slick.

10:09.651 --> 10:14.990
You'll slam into the wall
before you know it. So take it easy.

10:25.751 --> 10:30.130
- I'm dropping the hammer.
- No, you're not.

11:02.913 --> 11:07.543
- it's under Rowdy's time.
- He should've cracked up the car.

11:23.058 --> 11:26.478
- That was fast.
- Yeah?

11:26.687 --> 11:31.900
31 flat. That's good enough to take
the pole in the last race here.

11:34.987 --> 11:40.742
- You never drove a stock car?.
- No, sprints mainly.

11:40.951 --> 11:46.290
- Buck Bretherton.
- Cole Trickle, nice to meet you.

11:46.456 --> 11:51.003
You were one lucky son of a bitch
in the tunnel turn.

11:51.170 --> 11:54.923
lf you think it was luck,
let's do it again.

11:55.132 --> 11:57.176
You run good.

11:57.384 --> 12:01.930
Go get your own car
and we'll see how you do in a crowd.

12:03.724 --> 12:08.854
- What's wrong with open wheels?
- l lost my ride.

12:09.021 --> 12:13.233
After all those wins,
you were fired?

12:13.400 --> 12:19.990
l lost my ride. I'd have quit
regardless. l wasn't going anywhere.

12:20.199 --> 12:24.119
- Where do you want to go?
- Indianapolis.

12:24.328 --> 12:29.833
To win in Indy I'd need a great car,
but stock cars are all the same.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.754
There's nothing stock
about a stock car.

12:33.962 --> 12:39.176
I'm not trying to insult you, but
stock cars are built to run equal.

12:39.384 --> 12:46.433
- l won't be beaten by a car.
- Only by a driver.

12:47.976 --> 12:51.480
You build me a car,
and I'll win Daytona next year.

12:56.693 --> 13:01.406
I'm going to give you an engine
low to the ground.

13:01.573 --> 13:05.869
An extra-big oil pan
that'll cut the wind underneath you.

13:06.036 --> 13:11.375
That'll give you
30-40 more horsepower.

13:11.542 --> 13:16.839
I'll give you a fuel line
that'll hold an extra gallon of gas.

13:17.005 --> 13:21.134
I'll shave half an inch off you
and shape you like a bullet.

13:21.301 --> 13:25.347
When l get you primed,
painted and weighed ...

13:25.514 --> 13:32.354
... you're going to be ready
to go out on that racetrack.

13:32.521 --> 13:35.941
You're going to be perfect.

14:47.137 --> 14:50.224
I'm going to pull
this rookie's chain.

14:55.187 --> 14:59.733
- Cole, you're all over the track.
- He just slammed into me.

14:59.942 --> 15:05.781
He didn't slam you or bump you.
He rubbed you. Rubbing is racing.

15:14.122 --> 15:17.793
There goes the fender.

15:20.045 --> 15:23.632
There goes the quarter panel.

15:50.701 --> 15:56.623
While we're still under a caution,
go out and hit the pace car.

15:56.832 --> 16:00.961
Hit the pace car?. What for?.

16:01.128 --> 16:07.634
You hit every other damn thing
out there. l want you to be perfect.

16:23.066 --> 16:25.110
You're too high.

16:46.340 --> 16:50.093
How about that?
This side we don't have to fix.

16:53.472 --> 16:56.892
l don't want you spoiled, Buck.

17:12.699 --> 17:15.077
This is gonna hurt.

17:19.957 --> 17:22.709
Did you see that guy?.

17:35.055 --> 17:39.434
- I've got to pit.
- No, we're busy now.

17:39.601 --> 17:43.730
- We're eating ice cream.
- Ice cream!

17:54.992 --> 17:59.788
You can come in and get one,
but it wouldn't impress NASCAR.

17:59.997 --> 18:04.877
You have enough trouble
riding around the track as it is.

18:18.682 --> 18:21.059
Take it easy.

18:21.268 --> 18:24.438
Come on now, Cole!

18:32.446 --> 18:38.035
We messed up big-time on Sunday.
l had sponsors in the stands.

18:38.202 --> 18:44.124
l was hugging and holding hands
and praying for a good showing.

18:44.291 --> 18:49.338
And we end up looking like
a monkey fucking a football.

18:51.715 --> 18:57.638
Everybody out, please ...
except you two.

19:05.062 --> 19:10.984
I've got a question: What is the one
thing you need to do to win a race?

19:11.193 --> 19:15.489
- it's pretty obvious ...
- Quiet! You must finish the race.

19:15.656 --> 19:20.118
l realize that Harry's
been around a long time.

19:20.327 --> 19:24.957
But l need a proper car
that doesn't blow engines.

19:25.123 --> 19:29.378
lf he didn't over-rev the engine,
it wouldn't blow.

19:29.545 --> 19:32.506
When you shift the gear, -

19:32.673 --> 19:39.429
- and the needle on the tach
reads 9,000 rpm, that's bad.

19:41.223 --> 19:45.769
- The tires blow, is that my fault?
- Yes, it's your fault.

19:45.936 --> 19:49.523
There's 40 other drivers out there
who don't use up their tires.

19:49.731 --> 19:54.194
There's nothing l can't do
with a race car.

19:54.361 --> 19:58.031
- There's only so much l can do!
- That's obvious.

19:58.198 --> 20:01.869
He doesn't need
to appreciate your job to do his.

20:02.077 --> 20:06.206
He has to know
what a car can and can't do!

20:06.373 --> 20:11.336
You want me to work the pit
and you drive?

20:12.713 --> 20:16.133
l can't talk to this son of a bitch.

20:17.885 --> 20:22.347
l can't talk to that son of a bitch.
l really can't.

20:26.602 --> 20:29.855
- You think he can drive?
- He can drive.

20:30.063 --> 20:33.483
He can drive
beyond the limits of the car!

20:33.650 --> 20:36.904
lf he'd listen to me,
we'd never lose a race.

20:39.489 --> 20:44.786
lf we don't get a sponsor soon,
my ass is fried.

20:47.915 --> 20:51.585
I'm liable to be out
of the car business all together.

20:51.752 --> 20:56.048
Harry, l know you're great.
You know you're great.

20:56.215 --> 21:01.178
But if the driver doesn't trust you,
we're never going to win a race.

21:14.149 --> 21:17.319
Hey, Harry.

21:21.156 --> 21:26.620
- We've got to talk.
- All right, talk.

21:26.787 --> 21:29.873
On the radio during the race ...

21:30.082 --> 21:35.128
You've got to tell us
what's going on with the car.

21:35.337 --> 21:38.257
You want to change the way l drive.

21:38.423 --> 21:41.760
Set up the car
so l don't have to change.

21:41.927 --> 21:45.764
- Tell me how.
- What do you want to know?.

21:45.931 --> 21:49.017
Is she running loose or tight?

21:49.226 --> 21:54.022
A turn here, take some wedge out,
we'll win some races.

21:54.231 --> 22:00.487
l can't do that. l don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

22:00.654 --> 22:04.158
How do you mean that?

22:11.081 --> 22:17.796
- l don't know much about cars.
- Neither does any other driver.

22:17.963 --> 22:22.009
No, l really don't know.
A turn here? A wedge there?

22:22.176 --> 22:25.596
- l don't know.
- How can that be?

22:25.762 --> 22:30.058
They told me
to get in a car and drive.

22:31.226 --> 22:37.733
I'd like to help out, but l can't.
l don't have the vocabulary.

22:41.862 --> 22:49.244
Well ... we're just going
to have to figure one out.

22:52.039 --> 22:57.085
Don't worry about it.
All right?

22:58.629 --> 23:02.049
How does she feel?

23:02.257 --> 23:08.931
- Her ass is all over the place.
- Her rear end is loose.

23:09.097 --> 23:13.310
''Loose'' is fast, and ''on the edge''
is out of control.

23:16.438 --> 23:20.984
Cole, there is something else.

23:21.193 --> 23:27.282
- Tires is what wins a race.
- What are you talking about?

23:27.449 --> 23:32.788
lf you can't run without melting
the tires, we can't finish a race.

23:32.955 --> 23:36.375
What do you want?

23:36.542 --> 23:40.838
Run 50 laps any way you like,
then 50 laps like l want you to.

23:41.046 --> 23:45.676
Give me an honest run.
lf you do, I'll beat you.

24:00.023 --> 24:04.027
Now we're going to do it
50 laps my way.

24:04.194 --> 24:08.907
When you were racing Indy cars,
the tires were twice as wide -

24:09.074 --> 24:14.830
- and the car weighed half as much.
Now it's the opposite.

24:15.038 --> 24:20.169
You're burning them up.
They melt and get greasy.

24:20.335 --> 24:26.091
You slip and slide
and you're out of control. Let's go!

24:41.064 --> 24:45.110
His way, my way.
l was six seconds faster.

24:45.277 --> 24:49.489
You can buy me some lunch
at the highway joint.

25:04.254 --> 25:08.091
- What's wrong?
- We're figuring out what to do.

25:09.426 --> 25:12.596
- About what?
- We're in trouble.

25:12.804 --> 25:18.393
Rowdy took the pole in 30:25.
We're almost a second off the pace.

25:18.560 --> 25:22.397
We're looking for some speed.

25:23.649 --> 25:27.236
The car's perfect, Harry.

25:36.620 --> 25:42.960
it's the first race of the season at
Darlington International Speedway.

25:43.126 --> 25:48.382
You're running 12th.
30 laps to go.

26:00.686 --> 26:06.692
- You're going to burn the tires.
- Everybody else slowed down.

26:06.859 --> 26:11.738
He's right. Check his lap times.
Everybody else has fallen off.

26:11.905 --> 26:18.328
You're doing good, Cole.
You're gaining on the leader.

26:22.291 --> 26:25.002
15 to go.

26:27.212 --> 26:30.132
Don't pass
on the outside of turn four.

26:32.009 --> 26:35.512
Stay to the inside.
Ten laps to go.

26:39.308 --> 26:42.811
Trickle is right behind Rowdy Burns.

26:43.020 --> 26:48.233
- I'm right behind the leader.
- Five laps to go.

26:50.319 --> 26:54.072
- Remember me?
- What the hell's going on?

26:54.239 --> 26:57.409
Just a little rubbing.
Rubbing's racing.

27:03.624 --> 27:07.211
I'm going to take this rookie
once and for all.

27:11.256 --> 27:16.386
That's enough!
You can't play with Rowdy like this.

27:16.595 --> 27:19.139
Relax, Harry.

27:21.391 --> 27:24.811
Rowdy Burns is out!

27:25.020 --> 27:29.483
No! An incredible recovery by Rowdy.

27:29.650 --> 27:35.072
We have a new leader.
Cole Trickle in number 46.

27:35.239 --> 27:38.659
We're under caution
with three laps to go.

27:38.826 --> 27:42.079
- Come on in.
- What for?. it's almost over.

27:42.287 --> 27:45.874
You've done 68 laps.
Everybody's got to pit, Cole.

27:56.552 --> 27:59.179
Go, go!

27:59.346 --> 28:03.517
The air gun's jammed,
get me another one.

28:06.812 --> 28:10.232
Let's go!

28:14.444 --> 28:16.488
Damn it! Go! Go!

28:16.655 --> 28:19.616
Get them on quick!

28:27.833 --> 28:32.963
- Son of a bitch!
- Now, Cole ...

28:37.551 --> 28:40.721
- Son of a bitch!
- We're on the air, all right?

28:40.929 --> 28:45.225
l was in first place. Now I'm
in third with two laps to go.

28:45.434 --> 28:51.023
Don't get excited.
Third place is pretty respectable.

28:51.190 --> 28:56.570
Going into turn four,
drive right by him on the outside.

28:56.737 --> 29:00.240
Nobody goes to the outside
on turn four.

29:00.449 --> 29:06.955
- You can hold it.
- He's going to end up in the wall.

29:07.164 --> 29:12.377
The pace car is about to go off.
We don't have time to talk.

29:12.544 --> 29:16.715
- We've got a good set of tires on.
- What?

29:16.882 --> 29:21.094
- Those tires are matched perfect.
- You're going to get him killed.

29:21.261 --> 29:26.642
lf you go to the outside,
you can hold it.

29:26.808 --> 29:29.019
All right.

29:37.027 --> 29:41.073
The white flag is out.
One lap to go.

29:57.506 --> 30:01.260
The boy don't have the balls
to pass me on the outside.

30:01.426 --> 30:05.806
They're heading into
treacherous turn four.

30:30.914 --> 30:35.043
Cole Trickle wins his first ever
NASCAR victory.

30:35.210 --> 30:39.339
Second place goes to Rowdy Burns.

30:48.015 --> 30:54.021
On that last turn, did you know you
could make the car stick like that?

30:54.229 --> 30:59.985
l knew it all along.
Harry put on special tires.

31:00.152 --> 31:05.532
- What's special about them?
- Nothing in particular.

31:07.451 --> 31:11.288
- You told me ...
- l had to calm you down.

31:11.497 --> 31:16.043
You were acting like such
a candy-ass when the air gun stuck.

31:21.381 --> 31:26.011
Try this on for size.
We've got ourselves a sponsor.

31:30.474 --> 31:36.730
Promise me that whatever else we do
from here, we win Daytona.

31:36.897 --> 31:39.983
That's a promise.

31:45.322 --> 31:51.662
Selling useless mining stock
is called a dog and pony show.

31:51.829 --> 31:57.918
It may be funny, but it's not that
funny when it happens to you.

31:58.126 --> 32:03.757
- It happened to me.
- You bought worthless stock?.

32:03.924 --> 32:08.470
l told you l lost my ride.
That's how l lost it.

32:08.679 --> 32:13.308
Team owner was a conman
selling junk bonds.

32:13.475 --> 32:17.062
But mainly he sold stolen yachts.

32:17.229 --> 32:20.983
After l won, he used my name
to promote the sales.

32:21.149 --> 32:25.696
He went to jail
and l lost my ride.

32:27.447 --> 32:32.870
- It was pretty humiliating.
- Hell, don't be embarrassed.

32:33.036 --> 32:37.666
Some lowlife piece of trash
put you in a bad position.

32:37.875 --> 32:45.174
That depends on whether you're
related to that piece of trash.

32:46.300 --> 32:49.553
He was my father.

32:49.720 --> 32:54.349
I've never really
stuck with anything since.

32:54.516 --> 33:00.480
They don't trust me,
and l don't trust them.

33:00.647 --> 33:04.151
Like for instance ...

33:04.318 --> 33:09.281
You lied to me today. It was
dumb-luck l didn't end up crashed.

33:09.448 --> 33:14.578
- l ought to punch you out.
- Yeah? Give it a try.

33:18.081 --> 33:20.626
No.

33:20.792 --> 33:25.756
l wouldn't want my ass kicked
by a 60-year-old man.

33:25.964 --> 33:28.342
59.

33:41.480 --> 33:46.610
Drivers just don't go
to the outside like that.

33:46.777 --> 33:52.866
l knew you could do it.
l believed it in my heart.

33:57.120 --> 34:00.040
- Peach or cherry?.
- Cherry.

34:03.502 --> 34:07.005
l need a leak.

34:07.214 --> 34:11.760
There's calculating drivers,
and then there's kamikaze drivers.

34:11.927 --> 34:18.350
Cole here's a kamikaze,
like my pappy was. Buddy Bretherton.

34:18.559 --> 34:23.105
Buddy Bretherton was your dad?

34:23.313 --> 34:27.150
- He died at Daytona.
- Last year.

34:27.359 --> 34:31.029
- How did it happen?
- He hit the wall.

34:31.196 --> 34:37.286
He was probably dead before that.
The coroner reported a heart attack.

34:52.217 --> 34:55.304
We've been pulled over.

34:59.016 --> 35:05.105
Everybody out and up against
the wall. You're under arrest.

35:06.440 --> 35:09.276
- What the hell for?.
- That.

35:09.443 --> 35:14.156
Transportation of alcohol
for the purpose of distribution.

35:14.323 --> 35:18.494
This is not distribution,
this is consumption.

35:18.660 --> 35:25.250
That doesn't make it legal.
Up against the wall.

35:37.179 --> 35:42.059
It looks like we've found something.
A concealed weapon.

35:42.267 --> 35:46.480
- Where?
- Right here.

35:52.444 --> 35:56.365
Now, the only question is:

36:00.828 --> 36:04.331
Will he actually use it?

36:16.468 --> 36:21.348
Don't be mad. Harry and the boys
thought you might like me.

36:28.730 --> 36:33.360
Here we are for summer speed week
in Daytona Beach, Florida.

36:33.569 --> 36:39.074
The favorite today is newcomer
Cole Trickle in number 46.

36:39.241 --> 36:44.913
He has won an unprecedented
five out of his last six races.

37:01.430 --> 37:05.976
Stop playing peek-a-boo
in Rowdy's rear-view mirror.

37:10.898 --> 37:15.444
- I'm not doing anything like that.
- Then what are you doing?

37:18.405 --> 37:22.242
l loosened his bumper.
I'll have to break it off.

37:22.451 --> 37:26.497
lf his bumper goes through
your radiator, you're finished.

37:28.332 --> 37:32.419
Rowdy, let him go by.

37:34.880 --> 37:38.467
I'm going to take him
on the high side.

37:57.152 --> 38:04.451
- What are you worried about, Harry?.
- Great recovery, Cole.

38:12.459 --> 38:17.422
Trickle's right behind the number 51
car, and they'll go at it again.

38:27.766 --> 38:31.979
There's a crash
coming out of turn four.

38:35.732 --> 38:37.860
l see it.

39:09.057 --> 39:14.438
- l can't see anything.
- Wiggle your fingers for me.

39:14.605 --> 39:18.192
l can't see anything.

39:18.358 --> 39:21.528
I'm all right.

39:28.243 --> 39:32.498
- l don't need recharging.
- It's standard procedure.

39:32.664 --> 39:36.001
- You go screw yourself.
- What was that?

39:36.210 --> 39:39.296
l wouldn't tell you to do that.

39:47.054 --> 39:51.350
- Tell me what's going on.
- What's your name?

39:51.558 --> 39:58.232
- Cole.
- Cole, lie still, please.

39:59.650 --> 40:03.737
- CAT scan, right away.
- Yes, Doctor.

40:11.495 --> 40:15.874
He's had a concussion. His brain
is bruised and it's going to swell.

40:16.083 --> 40:19.253
That's what's affecting his vision.

40:19.461 --> 40:22.464
You have a concussion.

40:22.631 --> 40:26.760
- It will affect your vision.
- Will it go away?.

40:26.927 --> 40:30.931
Tell him we're running some tests.

40:31.098 --> 40:35.102
What did his helmet look like?
Was it cracked?

40:35.269 --> 40:39.314
- No.
- Was it scratched?

40:41.024 --> 40:44.862
Was the helmet scratched
at the front or back?.

40:45.028 --> 40:49.908
- The back and the front.
- Are you a brain doctor?

40:50.075 --> 40:54.204
Could someone talk to me?

40:55.914 --> 41:01.837
When I'm driving, I've got a guy
on the radio who talks to me.

41:04.590 --> 41:10.137
Don't worry,
we're going to take care of him.

41:37.956 --> 41:40.083
Harry.

41:40.250 --> 41:44.087
- Are you okay, Harry?.
- Yeah. Why?.

41:47.466 --> 41:52.095
You look all bent out of shape.

41:55.015 --> 42:00.938
- Hell, it's probably just my eyes.
- No, I've been here all night.

42:01.146 --> 42:05.234
Jesus! What are they giving me here?

42:05.400 --> 42:08.987
What happened?

42:09.196 --> 42:14.159
Rowdy was spinning across the track.

42:14.326 --> 42:18.539
The rule is, go straight for them.

42:18.747 --> 42:23.126
So l never took my foot off the gas.

42:23.335 --> 42:29.675
He should have been gone by the time
l got there ... but he wasn't.

42:29.883 --> 42:36.390
l think another car hit you
and knocked you into Rowdy.

42:38.475 --> 42:43.856
It's one of those things that never
happens. Don't even think about it.

42:47.401 --> 42:51.613
- I'll get the doctor.
- l feel great.

43:09.965 --> 43:13.719
Damn nice to see you, Cole.

43:16.013 --> 43:20.058
It's damn nice to see you, Buck.

43:22.477 --> 43:25.898
Cole, you've met Dr Lewicki.

43:29.902 --> 43:33.655
- That's your doctor.
- He's not actually seen me before.

43:33.864 --> 43:36.408
Sure, Harry.

43:37.409 --> 43:41.079
- No ...
- Dr Lewicki.

43:41.288 --> 43:46.793
Smock, stethoscope.
It's a great costume, Harry.

43:46.960 --> 43:50.631
- How are you, Doc?
- This really is Dr Lewicki.

43:50.797 --> 43:56.470
- l was just about to go off duty.
- You came by to look me over.

43:56.678 --> 44:00.974
That's not a bad idea.
Is your vision restored?

44:01.183 --> 44:05.020
- l think so.
- Nothing's blurred?

44:05.229 --> 44:09.858
No haloes around objects?
Flashing lights?

44:10.025 --> 44:14.905
- What are you going to do now?.
- Look into your eyes.

44:15.113 --> 44:18.033
Doc ...

44:19.952 --> 44:24.665
Isn't this
what you're really looking for?.

44:26.333 --> 44:30.879
That's interesting enough,
but it's just not my specialty.

44:43.267 --> 44:49.189
- She was the real thing?
- l wouldn't be joking around here.

44:49.398 --> 44:52.818
Sorry, I'm trying not to smile.

44:52.985 --> 44:56.071
All right, get out.

44:56.238 --> 44:59.324
Get out of here.

45:08.292 --> 45:12.921
- l can walk.
- Not while you're in this hospital.

45:15.966 --> 45:23.015
- Can you pick up the pace a little?
- lf you want drugs, see the nurse.

45:59.760 --> 46:03.096
Get out of the way.

46:08.268 --> 46:13.899
Good morning, gentlemen.
Right this way.

46:17.778 --> 46:22.741
Neither Mr. Burns nor Mr. Trickle
have any significant cranial injury.

46:22.950 --> 46:27.329
Let's have that in English.
Did they mess up their squash?

46:27.496 --> 46:31.708
Their brains are intact ...
as much as they ever were.

46:31.875 --> 46:36.839
- Do they get clearance to race?
- It's a dangerous pastime.

46:37.047 --> 46:42.594
- That's not a medical objection.
- They won't get clearance just yet.

46:42.761 --> 46:47.891
- That's total horseshit.
- Gentlemen, please ...

46:48.058 --> 46:52.688
l think they'd like another opinion.
We'd like to talk to your boss.

46:59.194 --> 47:01.738
Which is a re-evaluation
in a week or two.

47:01.905 --> 47:05.909
Thank you. We have something
to say to the boys in private.

47:13.959 --> 47:16.503
Okay, Big John's turn.

47:22.593 --> 47:28.098
lf you want to become a greasy
spot on a country road, go ahead.

47:28.265 --> 47:31.810
l don't give a shit
and l don't think anybody else does.

47:32.019 --> 47:36.565
But you're not going to do it
on my racetrack.

47:36.773 --> 47:42.279
You've all heard
of Japanese inspection?

47:42.446 --> 47:47.075
When the Japs get a load of lettuce
they don't want in the country, -

47:47.284 --> 47:51.830
- they let it sit on the docks
until they get ready to look at it.

47:52.039 --> 47:57.503
By then it's all gone rotten.
There's nothing left to inspect.

47:57.669 --> 48:02.633
Lettuce is a perishable item,
like you two monkeys.

48:02.841 --> 48:08.514
You trade paint one more time,
I'll black flag the two of you.

48:08.680 --> 48:13.393
I'll take apart your race car
for inspection.

48:13.602 --> 48:17.523
After you've put it back together,
you can race.

48:17.689 --> 48:22.569
Now, as there's no hard feelings,
we're all going out to dinner.

48:22.736 --> 48:28.200
- I've got other plans.
- You'll have to change them.

48:28.367 --> 48:33.330
You two are going
to drive to dinner together.

48:39.795 --> 48:42.172
Dr Lewicki ...

48:42.381 --> 48:47.261
l want to apologize
for what happened with Cole.

48:47.427 --> 48:53.058
It's nothing to worry about.
It was hardly your doing.

48:53.225 --> 49:01.108
That's just it, it was. Not long
ago, we played a trick on Cole.

49:01.275 --> 49:05.654
We dressed up a pretty girl
in a highway-patrol uniform.

49:05.821 --> 49:11.577
We told her to get real ornery
with him and she did.

49:11.743 --> 49:16.373
- You mean ..?
- l mean real ornery.

49:16.582 --> 49:23.547
- Why do you want me to know this?
- Don't hold a bad opinion of Cole.

49:23.714 --> 49:29.887
l believe it scares him. He needs
reassurance from you that he's okay.

49:30.053 --> 49:33.807
After all, you're his doctor.

49:38.645 --> 49:41.648
That's it.

50:00.375 --> 50:02.419
Doc ...

50:02.628 --> 50:08.717
l heard you thought
l was a highway-patrol officer.

50:08.926 --> 50:13.013
- Thank you for taking care of me.
- It's my job.

50:13.180 --> 50:19.978
- It's my life.
- This time let's shake hands.

50:20.145 --> 50:24.858
- Of course.
- Good luck, Cole.

50:32.032 --> 50:36.662
- Dr Lewicki, could l see you?
- You will, l promise.

50:36.870 --> 50:42.292
l mean have some dinner,
I'll take you to a race.

50:42.459 --> 50:48.006
That's very sweet, but it won't get
you back on the track any faster.

50:48.173 --> 50:50.217
No ...

50:50.425 --> 50:54.012
It's not what l meant.

51:16.660 --> 51:20.164
- Now what?
- Here's how l see this deal ...

51:20.372 --> 51:26.295
Neither of us is going to let
the other drive this car to dinner.

51:26.461 --> 51:31.675
- There's only one way to settle it.
- What are you talking about?

51:35.179 --> 51:38.182
Absolutely.

52:17.137 --> 52:24.019
Let me tell you something. lf you
can't control your race drivers ...

52:25.938 --> 52:28.857
Stick to something you can control.

52:31.235 --> 52:35.781
Like used cars
in downtown Charlotte.

52:56.510 --> 52:59.763
- Too close to call?
- Yeah.

53:10.899 --> 53:16.196
- You're late.
- We had car trouble.

53:16.363 --> 53:23.412
- What kind of car trouble?
- l believe it was the radiator.

53:23.579 --> 53:27.499
Yes, Rowdy, l believe it was.

53:34.965 --> 53:37.426
Do you know anybody
at Daytona Memorial?

53:37.593 --> 53:41.889
- The chief of staff.
- Is he a race fan?

53:42.097 --> 53:47.144
Russ Wheeler is driving for us,
till you get your medical clearance.

53:47.311 --> 53:51.482
It's a real pleasure
to race your car, Mr. Trickle.

53:51.648 --> 53:56.195
l need the home address
of a doctor ...

53:56.361 --> 54:01.658
I'm only sorry l won't be able
to drive it as good as you.

54:01.825 --> 54:05.829
I'll see you later, Harry.

54:05.996 --> 54:09.333
The doctor ...

54:14.171 --> 54:17.257
What?

54:32.940 --> 54:37.277
l was desperate
to get your attention.

54:37.444 --> 54:41.698
You got it.
l walked into a jungle.

54:41.865 --> 54:47.704
It's nicely extravagant,
but l can't. I'm a doctor on call.

54:47.871 --> 54:53.544
Somebody has to re-examine me.
I'll take you to a race.

54:53.710 --> 54:59.633
l don't want to watch you guys
chasing each other on my day off.

54:59.800 --> 55:02.886
How about chasing me
on your day off?

55:03.095 --> 55:07.891
l don't have a day off.
I'm on call 24 hours.

55:08.058 --> 55:12.146
- Let's suppose you had a day off.
- Sugar.

55:14.857 --> 55:17.943
Could l interest you
in the North Carolina countryside?

55:18.110 --> 55:21.613
- Speaking theoretically?.
- Speaking theoretically.

55:21.780 --> 55:25.200
Maybe.
You'd have to convince my boss.

55:25.367 --> 55:29.121
Good. How tall are you?

55:44.803 --> 55:49.850
- What did he say?.
- Fly to Charlotte to see the boys.

55:53.729 --> 55:57.941
You're very quick.

55:58.108 --> 56:02.488
You ought to see me drive.

56:04.865 --> 56:09.411
- Rowdy is not here.
- l told him to be here by five.

56:09.578 --> 56:14.374
We should probably get started
on Cole.

56:17.377 --> 56:20.339
Close your eyes. Palms up.

56:22.341 --> 56:26.011
Open your eyes. Arms down.

56:27.012 --> 56:29.723
Follow my finger.

56:44.404 --> 56:48.951
Stand with your feet together
and close your eyes.

56:51.036 --> 56:55.290
Walk one foot in front of the other.
Open your eyes.

56:57.501 --> 57:00.838
Back on the table.

57:06.760 --> 57:12.057
- This is tough.
- Examinations always are.

57:12.224 --> 57:15.644
l might not like what l see.

57:15.811 --> 57:22.067
That has to worry you. Pick a spot
on the wall and look at it.

57:25.195 --> 57:31.285
Please, don't move your eyes.
Just focus on one spot.

57:40.002 --> 57:44.965
- What do you see?
- The retina.

57:45.132 --> 57:49.261
What does it look like?

57:49.428 --> 57:53.724
Very pretty, actually.

57:59.771 --> 58:02.774
- Seen enough?
- Just about.

58:05.319 --> 58:10.741
- What did you do that for?.
- It's the Lowinski sign.

58:10.908 --> 58:16.038
lf the toe goes up, you're in
trouble. You're cleared to race.

58:34.681 --> 58:39.311
I'm sorry,
it just drove me nuts in there.

58:40.270 --> 58:45.859
- How could you ignore me like that?
- l wasn't ignoring you!

58:51.240 --> 58:56.286
l wasn't ignoring you.
l gave you a very thorough physical.

59:03.585 --> 59:07.881
- Don't do anything weird.
- l won't.

59:08.090 --> 59:11.510
It's something
Harry and l work on together.

59:11.677 --> 59:14.680
It's called draughting.

59:14.888 --> 59:20.394
One car tucks in behind another.
Two cars can go faster than one.

59:20.561 --> 59:24.481
They divide the air resistance.

59:24.690 --> 59:28.986
The lead car has to floor it
to hit 200 mph.

59:29.194 --> 59:34.241
The car behind doesn't. He can go
just as fast with power in reserve.

59:34.408 --> 59:38.245
When these two cars
come off that last turn, -

59:38.412 --> 59:42.875
- the car at the back
can move out of the draught, -

59:43.041 --> 59:49.047
- slingshot past the lead car
and beat it to the finish line.

59:50.340 --> 59:53.594
He goes straight to Victory Lane.

59:53.760 --> 01:00:00.559
- You and Harry work on that?
- More or less.

01:00:00.726 --> 01:00:07.232
Yeah, right. Is there anything
you want to do besides racing?

01:00:11.069 --> 01:00:18.035
- Anything you say.
- You must want something else ...

01:00:18.202 --> 01:00:21.371
... eventually.

01:00:23.040 --> 01:00:29.630
l can tell you what l don't want
to be in life, and that's a fraud.

01:00:29.838 --> 01:00:36.178
l want to know it's not just luck
that gets me round that racetrack.

01:00:36.386 --> 01:00:41.266
- But that's not what you're asking.
- What am l asking?

01:00:41.433 --> 01:00:48.232
- How can l be in bed with this guy?.
- l know the answer to that one.

01:00:48.398 --> 01:00:55.155
How could a brilliant brain doctor
be in bed with a racing driver?.

01:00:57.783 --> 01:01:02.412
What's your response to that,
by the way?.

01:01:02.621 --> 01:01:07.501
Do something to make me respect you.

01:01:07.709 --> 01:01:12.089
Tell me what you love
so much about racing.

01:01:12.297 --> 01:01:15.300
The speed.

01:01:15.467 --> 01:01:18.303
To be able to control it.

01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:23.684
To know that l can control
something that's out of control.

01:01:25.310 --> 01:01:29.857
I'd really have to show you.

01:01:30.065 --> 01:01:33.068
Show me.

01:01:53.547 --> 01:02:00.679
It's funny. When l grew up, all l
wanted to do was work on race cars.

01:02:00.846 --> 01:02:05.809
Now all l want to do is to make
enough money to work on a farm.

01:02:06.018 --> 01:02:10.647
- Hi, Claire, I'm Jennie.
- Nice to meet you.

01:02:16.653 --> 01:02:20.240
We're going to build
our permanent home up there.

01:02:20.407 --> 01:02:24.411
- Does it cost much?
- About $10 million.

01:02:24.578 --> 01:02:28.707
Jennie's doing the building.
She's designing the house.

01:02:28.874 --> 01:02:33.921
We just want a place
that no one's lived in but us.

01:02:37.508 --> 01:02:40.427
- What is it?
- I'm just seasick.

01:02:45.349 --> 01:02:49.269
You didn't forget
about the physical.

01:02:49.436 --> 01:02:53.899
Nobody in my family goes to a doctor
unless they're dying.

01:02:54.107 --> 01:02:59.238
- I'm just not feeling good.
- Stand with your feet together.

01:03:01.865 --> 01:03:04.952
Put your arms out.

01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:08.580
Close your eyes.

01:03:13.043 --> 01:03:19.049
Take it easy. I've got you.

01:03:19.258 --> 01:03:22.511
I'm fine.

01:03:26.515 --> 01:03:28.559
I'm fine.

01:03:29.852 --> 01:03:32.396
Go back to Daytona.

01:03:32.604 --> 01:03:39.403
The head of neurosurgery is my boss.
He's as good as they come.

01:03:41.488 --> 01:03:45.868
- Did you get sick in there?
- No.

01:03:46.034 --> 01:03:53.750
He did, he got sick.
You're one hell of a candy-ass.

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:59.548
It's imperative that you get back
to Daytona and see Dr Wilhaire.

01:04:14.813 --> 01:04:19.526
There's another new Winston Cup team
sponsored by Hardee's.

01:04:19.693 --> 01:04:22.613
The driver is Russ Wheeler, -

01:04:22.779 --> 01:04:25.866
- the young man who subbed
so superbly for Cole Trickle.

01:04:26.074 --> 01:04:30.621
Listen to this horseshit.

01:04:30.829 --> 01:04:36.418
With these two competitive spirits,
will there be any conflict?

01:04:36.585 --> 01:04:43.008
We believe we can maintain the
integrity of these two race teams.

01:04:43.217 --> 01:04:45.969
Who will you be rooting for, Tim?

01:04:46.136 --> 01:04:50.307
I'll wave to Cole
every time l lap him.

01:04:56.522 --> 01:05:00.359
- These new tires are terrible.
- You're doing good, Cole.

01:05:00.567 --> 01:05:04.321
I'm too loose.

01:05:08.325 --> 01:05:13.705
- The car feels all wrong.
- Cole's upset.

01:05:13.872 --> 01:05:19.503
- What about?
- About being in that race car.

01:05:21.588 --> 01:05:27.261
Wheeler just passed the eight car.
He's coming up on your inside.

01:05:36.061 --> 01:05:39.314
Jesus!

01:06:10.345 --> 01:06:13.265
- The engine blew.
- How?.

01:06:13.432 --> 01:06:16.768
I'm not a mechanic, Harry.

01:06:29.656 --> 01:06:33.911
I'm in Georgia.
Rowdy's in North Carolina.

01:06:34.077 --> 01:06:38.790
Somebody better
talk him into coming down here.

01:06:38.957 --> 01:06:44.963
The longer he ignores it, the more
damage will be done to his brain.

01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:49.051
- Where's Cole?
- He's on the phone.

01:06:50.427 --> 01:06:54.264
We could use a little privacy.

01:06:58.644 --> 01:07:04.316
- What's wrong with him?
- What's wrong is you, Tim.

01:07:04.483 --> 01:07:09.696
- Two race teams is one too many!
- It doesn't bother Russ Wheeler.

01:07:09.863 --> 01:07:16.453
No, with Cole's reputation Wheeler
knows he can bump him all he wants.

01:07:16.662 --> 01:07:21.124
l don't see Russ doing anything
like that, neither does NASCAR.

01:07:21.333 --> 01:07:26.046
It ain't happening then, under
the watchful eyes of you experts!

01:07:26.255 --> 01:07:29.132
l tell you what is happening:

01:07:29.299 --> 01:07:33.929
Cole's not running good
and now he's got sponsor trouble.

01:07:34.096 --> 01:07:36.557
- But you don't?
- No.

01:07:36.765 --> 01:07:42.271
But l want to keep the sponsor
and Cole. He made this all happen.

01:07:42.437 --> 01:07:45.357
Right!

01:07:49.987 --> 01:07:54.283
Were you on the phone with the doc?
Fighting?

01:07:54.491 --> 01:07:58.078
She's too busy to talk right now.

01:07:58.287 --> 01:08:00.664
Here's your owner, Tim Daland.

01:08:00.873 --> 01:08:05.919
Russ ran a great race today.
I'm very pleased.

01:08:06.128 --> 01:08:10.674
102 laps complete, but we're under
caution here at North Wilkesboro.

01:08:10.883 --> 01:08:17.389
- Cole hasn't seen Rowdy yet.
- Cole's just like any other driver.

01:08:17.598 --> 01:08:21.518
He doesn't want to see Rowdy.

01:08:21.685 --> 01:08:26.982
Drivers don't like to be reminded of
what can happen to them out there.

01:08:27.149 --> 01:08:33.322
The only time a driver goes to a
funeral is when he's actually dead.

01:08:56.303 --> 01:09:01.225
- He's blocking me.
- That's right.

01:09:01.475 --> 01:09:05.354
Move the son of a bitch!

01:09:57.865 --> 01:09:59.575
Son of a bitch!

01:09:59.741 --> 01:10:05.289
Trickle at the bottom of the track
with both right-side tires flat.

01:10:05.455 --> 01:10:09.293
Wheeler takes the chequered flag.

01:10:15.007 --> 01:10:20.596
Wheeler doesn't deserve to win.
That's low-down shit-assed racing.

01:10:20.762 --> 01:10:23.932
It's just racing. Cole overreacted.

01:10:31.356 --> 01:10:36.820
- Change my tires.
- l don't know what for. It's over.

01:11:09.269 --> 01:11:13.816
There seems to be a little post-race
activity just outside the pit lane.

01:11:13.982 --> 01:11:17.569
You shit!

01:11:17.736 --> 01:11:22.950
He's destroyed both my cars!

01:11:23.116 --> 01:11:28.413
He's fired! You're all fired!

01:11:42.886 --> 01:11:49.059
- Are you heading off to Daytona?
- Where are you going from here?

01:11:49.226 --> 01:11:54.982
I'll take you to the airport.
I'll catch a flight to Charlotte.

01:11:57.234 --> 01:12:03.240
- You want me to come with you?
- What about the hospital?

01:12:04.074 --> 01:12:09.830
We could try to see Rowdy.

01:12:11.874 --> 01:12:17.087
- Is there anything wrong with that?
- Of course not.

01:12:17.254 --> 01:12:20.757
- l guess l forgot about that.
- Yeah, l know.

01:12:34.897 --> 01:12:37.816
Let me out of the car.

01:12:39.902 --> 01:12:41.945
Let me out.

01:12:47.201 --> 01:12:52.789
- Let me out or I'm getting out.
- Hey!

01:12:54.541 --> 01:12:58.045
Claire! Wait.

01:12:58.212 --> 01:13:03.342
- Get away or I'll call the police.
- I'm not leaving until we talk.

01:13:03.550 --> 01:13:07.221
- I've got nothing to say.
- Well l do!

01:13:10.849 --> 01:13:12.976
That's it? Fine.

01:13:13.185 --> 01:13:17.314
You shouldn't be driving a car,
not on a road or a racetrack.

01:13:17.481 --> 01:13:22.027
You're selfish, you're crazy
and you're scared.

01:13:22.236 --> 01:13:25.656
You and Rowdy have a sickness.
It's called denial.

01:13:25.864 --> 01:13:30.035
And it's probably
going to kill you both.

01:13:33.330 --> 01:13:37.084
You want to control something
that's out of control, right?

01:13:37.251 --> 01:13:41.797
I'm going to let you in on a secret
that most other people know.

01:13:42.005 --> 01:13:46.552
Control is an illusion. Nobody knows
what's going to happen next.

01:13:46.718 --> 01:13:49.012
Not on a freeway, -

01:13:49.179 --> 01:13:53.809
- and certainly not on a racetrack
with 40 other infantile egomaniacs.

01:13:54.017 --> 01:13:59.148
Nobody controls anything. You've had
a glimpse of that and you're scared.

01:13:59.356 --> 01:14:04.319
You might not have the courage
to race anymore.

01:14:06.655 --> 01:14:10.492
l hate you for this.
You make me sound like a doctor.

01:15:05.756 --> 01:15:08.926
Jennie ...

01:15:09.134 --> 01:15:12.221
Why are you here?

01:15:13.263 --> 01:15:16.767
Where is he?

01:15:27.236 --> 01:15:31.490
- l hear you're out of a job.
- Yeah.

01:15:35.452 --> 01:15:39.206
You're not looking too good.

01:15:39.373 --> 01:15:43.544
- How many of these do you take?
- What did you come here for?.

01:15:47.339 --> 01:15:50.676
To take you to the hospital.

01:15:52.678 --> 01:15:56.765
lf it wasn't for that woman doctor,
I'd be back on the track.

01:15:56.932 --> 01:16:00.769
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

01:16:00.978 --> 01:16:07.234
I've raced with my legs broken,
heart bruised and eyes popping out.

01:16:08.652 --> 01:16:13.824
This is going to go away.
I'm going to live forever, -

01:16:14.074 --> 01:16:19.663
- unless l go to some damn hospital
where you just lay down and die.

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:28.130
What did you win this for?.
This one right here.

01:16:29.631 --> 01:16:35.888
- Doesn't it say?.
- Yeah, it's the Winston Cup.

01:16:36.096 --> 01:16:41.393
What's your name?
Or has that slipped your mind, too?

01:16:42.895 --> 01:16:46.482
- Screw you, man.
- Okay.

01:16:46.648 --> 01:16:52.404
We can go down there and fix your
head or we can fix it right here!

01:16:57.159 --> 01:17:00.746
Rowdy would like to see you.

01:17:05.792 --> 01:17:09.129
- How is he?
- He's okay.

01:17:09.338 --> 01:17:13.008
- How are you?
- Good.

01:17:13.175 --> 01:17:17.012
- Will he make Daytona?
- He'll make it out of the hospital.

01:17:17.179 --> 01:17:22.226
But he'll never
drive a race car again.

01:17:27.689 --> 01:17:31.819
This is Dr Wilhaire.
He's going to be doing the surgery.

01:17:31.985 --> 01:17:34.446
Cole Trickle.

01:17:34.613 --> 01:17:36.990
How is he?

01:17:37.199 --> 01:17:41.912
The doc says
l need minor brain surgery.

01:17:42.079 --> 01:17:47.292
Any surgery on his brain
is bound to be minor.

01:17:47.501 --> 01:17:52.840
- Can l talk to this guy a second?
- Of course.

01:18:03.183 --> 01:18:06.436
A blood vessel in my brain busted.

01:18:06.603 --> 01:18:12.526
They want to drill a hole in my head
and get rid of the blood.

01:18:15.863 --> 01:18:17.489
- Should l let them do it?
- Yeah.

01:18:17.656 --> 01:18:21.869
- You'd let them if it was you?
- l would.

01:18:22.077 --> 01:18:28.250
Then I've got to ask you to do
something for me.

01:18:28.417 --> 01:18:31.753
- Drive my car.
- What?

01:18:31.962 --> 01:18:35.132
Daytona.

01:18:36.633 --> 01:18:40.471
You've got plenty of time
to get ready for Daytona.

01:18:42.389 --> 01:18:50.105
l lost my sponsor. They're not sure
I'm going to come out of this deal.

01:18:50.314 --> 01:18:53.484
Are you?

01:18:55.152 --> 01:18:59.239
I've got a lot of land
and a lot of plans l ain't paid for.

01:18:59.406 --> 01:19:04.203
So to get my sponsor back,
my car has to run good at Daytona.

01:19:04.411 --> 01:19:08.165
All that network TV shit.

01:19:08.373 --> 01:19:13.962
- There's plenty of other drivers.
- Don't give me that shit.

01:19:14.171 --> 01:19:17.674
My car has to be in the top five, -

01:19:17.883 --> 01:19:22.346
- before my sponsors
will pick up the tab for the year.

01:19:22.554 --> 01:19:27.351
Maybe after Daytona l can drive.

01:19:27.518 --> 01:19:34.107
In the meantime, l want the best
for my family, so don't bullshit me.

01:19:34.274 --> 01:19:41.406
Is there some other reason why
l ain't good enough to drive for?.

01:19:49.581 --> 01:19:52.918
Then you'll do it?

01:20:05.347 --> 01:20:08.600
Shit, man! You had me going.

01:20:10.269 --> 01:20:14.356
Let's get down to business.
What's your deal with Daland?

01:20:17.693 --> 01:20:22.823
l haven't worked it out.
Excuse me for a second.

01:20:26.493 --> 01:20:30.873
- Cole, what's wrong?
- Tell Rowdy I'll call him.

01:20:47.514 --> 01:20:53.437
No, sir! Can't use 'em.
Don't want 'em. Can't afford 'em.

01:20:53.604 --> 01:20:58.901
- What are you talking about?
- Race car drivers. You and Rowdy.

01:20:59.067 --> 01:21:03.155
l ain't setting up that car
for Daytona.

01:21:03.322 --> 01:21:08.702
But come on in. We'll bring out the
moonshine and start telling lies.

01:21:08.869 --> 01:21:14.958
- But no talk about racing.
- All right, no talk about racing.

01:21:15.167 --> 01:21:18.837
I'll race your ass.

01:21:29.556 --> 01:21:33.560
I'm going to take off.
Good night, Harry.

01:21:46.615 --> 01:21:50.285
Why won't you set up the car?.

01:21:54.039 --> 01:21:58.669
Ever since you and Rowdy
crashed at Daytona -

01:21:58.836 --> 01:22:03.549
- you've been waiting on something
bad to happen to you.

01:22:03.715 --> 01:22:09.221
Just like Buddy Bretherton.
He started hearing voices.

01:22:09.388 --> 01:22:12.391
All of them saying one thing:

01:22:12.558 --> 01:22:16.854
''Get out of that race car.''

01:22:21.942 --> 01:22:25.779
You pegged the engine at Atlanta
and blew it sky-high.

01:22:25.988 --> 01:22:30.617
It was deliberate.

01:22:30.784 --> 01:22:36.248
9,400 rpm
according to the telltale button.

01:22:37.875 --> 01:22:41.461
You thought if you didn't get out
of that car you'd die.

01:22:41.670 --> 01:22:45.174
Now call me a liar.

01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:49.636
- You're not lying.
- What are we talking about then?

01:22:49.803 --> 01:22:54.766
Racing Rowdy's car at Daytona.
l can't do it without you.

01:22:54.933 --> 01:22:59.021
You can't do it period.

01:22:59.188 --> 01:23:03.317
l ain't going back there, Cole.

01:23:13.494 --> 01:23:16.914
Buddy didn't die of a heart attack.

01:23:17.080 --> 01:23:20.918
Buddy didn't die of a heart attack.

01:23:21.084 --> 01:23:25.797
No, he didn't, but you don't
want to hear about it.

01:23:27.132 --> 01:23:34.181
NASCAR privately claimed
that your car is what killed Buddy.

01:23:35.641 --> 01:23:40.270
You used thin-walled tubing
to keep the weight down.

01:23:40.437 --> 01:23:43.857
- Carbon monoxide knocked Buddy out.
- Horseshit.

01:23:44.066 --> 01:23:50.781
When Buddy hit the wall, he was
talking as fast as he was driving.

01:23:50.989 --> 01:23:57.079
That was the loudest-talking
unconscious man you ever heard.

01:23:57.287 --> 01:24:02.084
Why didn't you let them investigate?

01:24:02.251 --> 01:24:06.964
Because l should have known better
than to let him drive.

01:24:08.340 --> 01:24:12.386
Buddy was a terrible
pain in the ass.

01:24:12.553 --> 01:24:18.392
He thought he knew about cars, which
made him twice as ignorant as you.

01:24:18.600 --> 01:24:22.521
Still ...

01:24:27.276 --> 01:24:30.362
Guys like Buddy ...

01:24:30.529 --> 01:24:34.575
I've seen him do things in my car
that are unbelievable.

01:24:34.783 --> 01:24:38.370
He showed me what l had done.

01:24:38.537 --> 01:24:43.000
Then you automatically
have to sort of love the guy ...

01:24:43.208 --> 01:24:46.795
... whether you want to or not.

01:24:47.004 --> 01:24:50.591
Buddy Bretherton.

01:24:50.799 --> 01:24:54.470
l have to ask you something.

01:24:56.722 --> 01:25:03.145
Before Buddy hit the wall,
how was he doing in that race?

01:25:03.312 --> 01:25:06.732
You ornery, no good ...

01:25:08.192 --> 01:25:11.945
You stay out of that car.

01:25:12.112 --> 01:25:16.492
lf you get back in that car,
you'll die. You hear?.

01:25:20.370 --> 01:25:24.666
I'm not getting back in my car,
I'm getting in Rowdy's.

01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:27.544
You dumb drivers.

01:25:27.711 --> 01:25:31.924
You think you'll hide
from your bad luck in his car?.

01:25:32.090 --> 01:25:36.303
He'd crash you tomorrow
to win the race!

01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:40.390
- He's no particular friend, so why?.
- He asked me to.

01:25:40.599 --> 01:25:46.021
- You just want to race again.
- And so do you.

01:25:46.188 --> 01:25:49.858
Well, you're scared.

01:25:50.025 --> 01:25:53.445
Yeah, and so are you.

01:25:54.154 --> 01:25:57.324
Yeah.

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:07.793
What?

01:26:09.545 --> 01:26:13.215
l need this, Harry.

01:26:15.425 --> 01:26:18.846
l don't have anything else.

01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:23.934
You've given me a life.

01:26:25.644 --> 01:26:28.897
l don't want to lose it.

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:37.030
Put me in that car. Let me be the
one to show you what you've done.

01:26:37.197 --> 01:26:40.200
Just trust me.

01:26:44.079 --> 01:26:49.585
Let me drive.
l won't make a fool out of you.

01:26:59.803 --> 01:27:07.019
l ... honestly don't know
how this deal's going to turn out.

01:27:09.563 --> 01:27:13.233
Neither do l, Harry.

01:27:36.215 --> 01:27:42.387
I'm setting up for cool weather.
lf the sun breaks, you'll run loose.

01:27:42.596 --> 01:27:48.185
Cole's not ready for that.
He's changed.

01:27:48.352 --> 01:27:52.272
You cannot get out of control.

01:27:52.481 --> 01:27:56.652
He's liable to hurt you
and you're liable to hurt him.

01:27:56.819 --> 01:27:59.988
l couldn't handle that.

01:28:00.197 --> 01:28:04.284
You've got to take care of him.
All right?

01:28:04.451 --> 01:28:07.788
You've got to take care of him.

01:28:17.756 --> 01:28:22.052
This is not the kind of answer
I'm looking for from you.

01:28:27.724 --> 01:28:31.478
Daytona is a tough racetrack.

01:28:31.645 --> 01:28:36.692
We're going to keep an eye on Cole
to see if he has all his reflexes.

01:28:36.900 --> 01:28:43.240
l don't think that the accident
will affect the way Cole performs.

01:28:43.448 --> 01:28:46.952
l hope l beat him.

01:28:47.161 --> 01:28:51.290
A lot of guys don't like him.
The guy's got a lot of talent.

01:28:51.456 --> 01:28:54.001
He just wants to win.

01:28:54.168 --> 01:28:59.131
He's been a danger to himself
and to other drivers.

01:28:59.298 --> 01:29:04.720
lf he comes near me,
I'm going to put him in the wall.

01:29:04.887 --> 01:29:08.640
l only expect to see him
in my rear-view mirror.

01:29:31.622 --> 01:29:34.500
Come in.

01:29:38.670 --> 01:29:43.467
Harry said you wouldn't mind
if l stopped by.

01:29:49.681 --> 01:29:54.645
- How's Rowdy?.
- He's getting better every day.

01:29:54.812 --> 01:29:59.858
Especially since you said you were
looking forward to racing his car.

01:30:00.067 --> 01:30:03.487
So l lied.

01:30:03.654 --> 01:30:08.534
- What are you thinking?
- 'What's he thinking?''

01:30:12.371 --> 01:30:18.961
Everybody's the same. You've got to
be good at your job to enjoy life.

01:30:19.169 --> 01:30:21.922
This is my job.

01:30:22.089 --> 01:30:25.592
It's all l know.

01:30:30.681 --> 01:30:35.185
You know l can't watch you do this.

01:30:35.394 --> 01:30:38.272
Claire ...

01:30:38.397 --> 01:30:44.403
I'm more afraid of being nothing
than l am of being hurt.

01:30:47.114 --> 01:30:50.367
Walk me in?

01:30:52.661 --> 01:30:57.291
Welcome to the Daytona 500,
the Superbowl of motor racing.

01:30:57.457 --> 01:31:04.256
Among today's favorites has
to be Wheeler in the Hardee's car.

01:31:04.423 --> 01:31:09.052
He's the man to watch, after
winning the pole for today's event.

01:31:09.261 --> 01:31:12.431
But don't count out Cole Trickle.

01:31:12.598 --> 01:31:17.978
He's returning to Daytona for
the first time since his accident.

01:31:19.771 --> 01:31:22.774
l heard you didn't have a sponsor.

01:31:22.941 --> 01:31:28.697
They gave us just enough money
to put their name on the car.

01:31:33.410 --> 01:31:37.080
- Tim.
- Cole.

01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:49.343
Why is the hood up?
What's wrong?

01:31:49.510 --> 01:31:55.265
We had to change engines.
We forgot to tighten the oil line.

01:31:55.432 --> 01:32:01.063
- Why did you change engines?
- There was metal in the oil filter.

01:32:01.230 --> 01:32:04.650
- Where did you get the engine?
- We stole it.

01:32:10.405 --> 01:32:17.246
Claire, put the boy in his car
before he starts sweating.

01:32:34.388 --> 01:32:38.934
So, are you going to get in your car
and take off?

01:32:41.645 --> 01:32:45.315
Drive carefully.

01:33:14.303 --> 01:33:17.014
Gentlemen, start your engines.

01:33:32.362 --> 01:33:36.366
We are underway.
The Daytona 500 is on.

01:33:45.417 --> 01:33:51.089
We are 56 laps into the 200-lap
event and Wheeler is in the lead.

01:33:54.218 --> 01:33:56.094
You're 47:01 . The leader's 45:90.
You're running last.

01:34:00.349 --> 01:34:04.895
What's going on, Cole?

01:34:07.147 --> 01:34:10.317
Are you all right?

01:34:15.656 --> 01:34:20.118
Just past the halfway mark
and Wheeler still leads.

01:34:32.256 --> 01:34:36.885
There's a crash at turn three.
Oil at the bottom of the track.

01:34:40.180 --> 01:34:44.560
Cars are sliding down
from the top of the track.

01:34:44.768 --> 01:34:48.981
You'd better go high.
Pick a line you can drive through.

01:34:51.650 --> 01:34:56.530
Cole, are you all right?
Answer me, please.

01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:02.161
Go around those wrecks.
You can drive through it.

01:35:02.369 --> 01:35:06.498
l know it in my heart.

01:35:19.136 --> 01:35:21.597
I'm through it, Harry!

01:35:23.682 --> 01:35:27.102
I'm out of here.

01:35:34.735 --> 01:35:37.654
Cole's moved up to ninth.

01:35:39.114 --> 01:35:44.870
Wheeler continues to lead, but the
man on the move is Cole Trickle.

01:35:51.168 --> 01:35:54.505
I'm going to make a hole
to get through here.

01:36:00.552 --> 01:36:03.472
Here we go.

01:36:12.147 --> 01:36:15.818
Wheeler knocked me into Ganz.
Ganz spun out.

01:36:21.031 --> 01:36:25.577
He's going high.
Goddamn it!

01:36:25.786 --> 01:36:29.206
Trickle takes the lead.

01:36:29.414 --> 01:36:32.835
Go, Cole.

01:36:35.045 --> 01:36:38.382
This is what it's all about.

01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:44.680
With 23 laps to go,
Cole Trickle is leading.

01:36:44.888 --> 01:36:48.392
- Take him now, Russ.
- He's all mine.

01:37:00.988 --> 01:37:03.991
The accelerator is stuck.

01:37:06.410 --> 01:37:09.288
l can't slow down.

01:37:09.454 --> 01:37:14.418
Step on the clutch
and let the son of a bitch blow it.

01:37:18.380 --> 01:37:20.507
Son of a ...

01:37:28.724 --> 01:37:34.897
The accelerator is fixed,
but the transmission is screwed.

01:37:49.786 --> 01:37:53.457
- Are they out of the race?
- They will be.

01:37:53.582 --> 01:37:58.045
Get me out in front of the pace car
or the race is over for us!

01:37:58.253 --> 01:38:03.759
- The linkage is all twisted.
- Just give him the high gear.

01:38:03.926 --> 01:38:09.223
- I've got it.
- Let's go.

01:38:09.389 --> 01:38:12.893
- Come on.
- Go! Go! Go!

01:38:13.101 --> 01:38:16.188
Get out there and help them!

01:38:26.114 --> 01:38:31.078
- We made it. Good work.
- l owe you one.

01:38:32.663 --> 01:38:35.207
That's not your car.

01:38:35.374 --> 01:38:38.961
It's my engine in that car and
that's what my boys are pushing.

01:38:42.548 --> 01:38:47.261
You've got to be at top speed
when the green flag drops.

01:38:50.681 --> 01:38:54.434
The green flag is out
and racing resumes.

01:38:54.643 --> 01:38:57.980
Wheeler's still in the lead.

01:39:02.526 --> 01:39:06.530
- Where am l?
- Ninth. Eight laps to go.

01:39:12.536 --> 01:39:17.332
- Am l gaining on Wheeler?.
- Trickle's moving up fast.

01:39:27.259 --> 01:39:29.636
Remember me?

01:39:35.559 --> 01:39:40.522
I'm going to draught Wheeler,
make him pull me around.

01:39:42.232 --> 01:39:45.569
He's on my ass.

01:39:47.946 --> 01:39:51.992
He's going on the outside.
I'm going to put him in the wall.

01:40:01.376 --> 01:40:04.463
I'm setting him up, Harry.

01:40:04.630 --> 01:40:09.426
There's the white flag.
One lap to go.

01:40:22.105 --> 01:40:27.945
- Don't keep this up, Cole, please.
- This guy's going down!

01:40:33.408 --> 01:40:37.329
Last turn, Russ.
He'll try and slingshot past you.

01:40:37.496 --> 01:40:41.583
l know Cole.
He always goes to the outside.

01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:44.837
This one's for you, Harry.

01:40:45.796 --> 01:40:48.590
He's going high.

01:40:51.343 --> 01:40:54.138
He's going low!

01:40:54.304 --> 01:40:57.307
Son of a bitch!

01:41:00.602 --> 01:41:05.941
Here comes the finish line,
and Cole Trickle takes the win!

01:41:45.731 --> 01:41:50.027
- You weren't going to watch.
- l lied.

01:41:55.365 --> 01:41:59.036
- Where's Harry?.
- l don't know.

01:42:08.086 --> 01:42:10.631
Harry ...

01:42:12.633 --> 01:42:18.889
- Say something, will you?
- l really can't.

01:42:22.935 --> 01:42:26.688
You didn't know
how this was going to turn out.

01:42:26.855 --> 01:42:33.821
