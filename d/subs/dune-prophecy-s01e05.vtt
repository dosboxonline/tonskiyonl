03:30.418 --> 03:34.005
As far back as humanity's time
on Old Earth,

03:35.548 --> 03:39.134
those whose actions seek to destroy
the social order

03:39.135 --> 03:41.638
have always warranted a swift response.

03:42.639 --> 03:47.060
The rebel plot to attack the Landsraad
was a grave threat to us all.

03:47.727 --> 03:52.107
If it were not for the actions of one
good and loyal subject,

03:53.066 --> 03:55.568
today's ceremony would've been a funeral.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.738
Now, more than ever,

03:59.739 --> 04:04.452
we need to defend our values
with ferocity and pride.

04:04.911 --> 04:08.623
That is why I have assembled
a new, elite regiment.

04:10.041 --> 04:15.005
And I charge you, Desmond Hart,
as my new Bashar.

04:17.007 --> 04:19.758
To lead these soldiers of the Imperium,

04:19.759 --> 04:25.015
and eradicate treason
and serve my house with honor,

04:26.182 --> 04:27.392
and loyalty.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.671
I've performed my duty.

04:57.672 --> 05:00.967
If my father gave you orders to watch me,
then you'd better keep up.

05:17.359 --> 05:20.820
My family's lives were just threatened.
I need you to deal with that.

05:21.696 --> 05:24.657
I'll take care of the insurgents,
Your Majesty.

05:25.200 --> 05:31.080
May I suggest you leave the fleet
in orbit over Salusa a bit longer?

05:31.081 --> 05:33.166
And delay stabilizing trade?

05:34.125 --> 05:35.752
Show of strength.

05:37.003 --> 05:40.507
A reminder of where power really lies.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.300
You were born to wear that uniform.

05:43.301 --> 05:45.887
I was born to serve, Your Grace.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.288
Francesca.

06:14.124 --> 06:17.043
It's been a long time, Javicco.

06:18.962 --> 06:21.798
Sister Francesca, what a surprise.

06:22.966 --> 06:26.177
Did no one inform you
this was a private affair?

06:28.304 --> 06:31.975
Your Grace,
I'm not here on Sisterhood business.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.687
Constantine sent me a message.

06:38.023 --> 06:40.400
I'm here to see my son.

06:50.285 --> 06:52.453
Do you know who I am?
Let me through.

06:52.454 --> 06:56.458
Your orders are to guard my sister,
not prevent me from seeing her.

06:57.375 --> 06:59.460
- Stop!
- You think it's them preventing you?

06:59.461 --> 07:00.711
Oh, come on, Nez.

07:00.712 --> 07:02.213
Is this really necessary?

07:02.922 --> 07:04.049
Fine.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.261
- I am--
- Sorry? Is that what you came to say?

07:09.262 --> 07:11.931
- If that's all.
- Look, I am sorry, Nez.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.100
And, no, that, that's not all.

07:16.811 --> 07:19.772
I feel terrible for leaving you
at the Landsraad.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.275
Father thought I was coming
to support him.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.363
And he was...

07:28.281 --> 07:29.574
proud.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.425
You should've told me what happened.

07:47.759 --> 07:49.969
I won't let you down like that again.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.058
<i>Heat is just energy.</i>

07:55.809 --> 07:57.976
With discipline,

07:57.977 --> 08:01.981
we can redistribute
that energy without harm.

08:04.234 --> 08:06.527
A focused mind is your greatest protector.

08:06.528 --> 08:10.572
And what protection do we have
when nightmares invade our minds?

08:10.573 --> 08:13.951
The highest master in the material world
is the human mind.

08:13.952 --> 08:15.327
Spare me the mysticism.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.329
The entire school is sharing a nightmare.

08:17.330 --> 08:19.873
And all we get is silence.

08:19.874 --> 08:22.251
Whose eyes watch from the darkness?

08:22.252 --> 08:24.128
You are out of line, acolyte.

08:24.129 --> 08:25.754
You want us to discern truth?

08:25.755 --> 08:29.049
How is that possible
when none of it exists here?

08:29.050 --> 08:31.636
We're dealing with a grave situation.

08:32.554 --> 08:35.514
Not only here on Wallach IX,
but on the Imperial planet.

08:35.515 --> 08:36.641
That is the truth.

08:37.225 --> 08:38.435
Find your resolve.

08:39.060 --> 08:41.396
Remember your duty, or leave.

08:42.063 --> 08:44.941
Those are the options.
The choice is yours.

08:49.112 --> 08:51.906
You, out now.

09:02.876 --> 09:06.880
- Am I being expelled?
- No, Sister Jen. Follow me.

09:09.758 --> 09:12.051
Is your sleep still uninterrupted?

09:12.052 --> 09:14.345
Do you mean have I had the dream? No.

09:14.346 --> 09:16.138
I don't know why.

09:16.139 --> 09:18.433
It may mean you're resistant to it.

09:22.604 --> 09:24.814
Which would make you
the perfect person to help me.

09:28.568 --> 09:29.943
Whatever you need.

09:29.944 --> 09:33.114
What I need is your discretion.

09:41.831 --> 09:45.043
I've taken a great risk
doing what I'm about to show you.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.086
And you're gonna have an opinion about it.

09:47.087 --> 09:49.255
- I don't understand.
- I had to try.

09:59.766 --> 10:00.892
Lila?

10:01.685 --> 10:02.852
Help me.

10:05.355 --> 10:08.066
Follow my voice. Follow my voice.

10:09.025 --> 10:10.443
Take her legs.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.487
Secure her limbs.

10:16.366 --> 10:17.491
What's happening to her?

10:17.492 --> 10:20.787
It's not her.
It's one of her foremothers.

10:22.455 --> 10:25.582
Remember what we talked about, Lila.

10:25.583 --> 10:27.502
What did you do to her?

10:28.461 --> 10:29.920
I found a way for her to survive.

10:29.921 --> 10:32.549
- Let go of me!
- This is survival?

10:33.258 --> 10:35.010
Lila is not lost to us.

10:35.510 --> 10:37.302
She just doesn't know what she's doing.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.807
We need to guide her back to herself.

10:41.975 --> 10:46.521
Lila! Lila, if you can hear me,
follow my voice.

10:47.355 --> 10:49.190
I have missed you so much.

10:52.527 --> 10:54.029
It's okay.

11:05.707 --> 11:10.128
In time, the ancestors will settle

11:10.670 --> 11:13.423
and she will learn to manage them.

11:14.090 --> 11:17.886
Now, I need you to stay here with her
because you are her friend.

11:18.803 --> 11:21.014
I have other matters I have to attend to.

11:21.639 --> 11:22.849
If you must,

11:23.933 --> 11:25.477
this is a mild sedative

11:26.186 --> 11:28.188
but only as a last resort.

11:40.533 --> 11:42.827
Sister Jen, I heard you.

11:43.370 --> 11:46.164
I'm here, Doe Eyes. I'm here.

12:12.107 --> 12:13.316
Mother?

12:21.074 --> 12:23.493
It's so good to see you, son.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.875
How is the other side of the universe?

12:31.835 --> 12:33.711
I wasn't expecting you.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.505
I came as soon as I got your message.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.633
My message?
I didn't send a crystal.

12:39.134 --> 12:41.261
I thought you were here because of Kasha.

12:42.929 --> 12:44.139
Kasha?

12:44.639 --> 12:45.849
She's...

12:47.100 --> 12:48.560
Don't you know?

12:50.020 --> 12:51.646
Kasha died.

12:54.441 --> 12:58.111
Mother Superior came to Zimia
and delivered the news herself.

13:05.618 --> 13:06.619
Come in.

13:09.831 --> 13:10.957
Lord Bashar?

13:15.086 --> 13:16.921
Well, well, well.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.592
You are audacious.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.804
I've come to offer a formal apology.

13:25.555 --> 13:27.806
My motion to open an inquiry against
House Corrino

13:27.807 --> 13:29.808
was inexcusable.

13:29.809 --> 13:33.730
Your apology is due
to the Emperor, not me.

13:35.273 --> 13:37.108
Do you have his ear?

13:41.237 --> 13:42.489
Shut the door.

13:47.035 --> 13:49.036
What you did at the High Council

13:49.037 --> 13:50.621
borders on treason.

13:50.622 --> 13:54.709
I swear, it was poor judgment.
Nothing more.

13:56.086 --> 13:58.421
I made the error of listening
to my aunt's suggestion.

13:59.631 --> 14:02.467
I was misguided. That happens often
when dealing with her.

14:09.516 --> 14:11.684
Your aunt made you do it?

14:11.685 --> 14:14.771
That woman does nothing
but bring shame to our house.

14:18.858 --> 14:19.901
Come sit.

14:34.708 --> 14:37.292
Why should I absolve you?

14:37.293 --> 14:40.547
Because we are not our bloodlines.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.759
My great uncle saw through her.

14:45.760 --> 14:46.970
Why couldn't I before he--

14:52.100 --> 14:56.854
I want to know what the ties are
between the Sisterhood

14:56.855 --> 14:58.522
and the rebellion.

14:58.523 --> 15:00.108
I don't know.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.028
I don't know who my aunt's in league with.

15:04.029 --> 15:06.906
I wouldn't describe us as close.

15:07.365 --> 15:10.994
Do you believe that they are meddling
in the spice trade

15:12.370 --> 15:14.205
to weaken the Emperor?

15:21.046 --> 15:22.047
Well?

15:23.882 --> 15:28.928
Give me evidence
and the Imperial House will reward you.

15:40.273 --> 15:42.734
- I do have something.
- You do?

15:43.693 --> 15:48.447
For a time, pirates were hijacking
every other shipment of my whale fur.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.908
No one knew who they were,
where to find them.

15:50.909 --> 15:53.452
Just dead ends.

15:53.453 --> 15:54.746
So,

15:55.372 --> 15:57.039
I stopped looking for pirates

15:57.040 --> 15:59.458
and I started looking
for contraband instead.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.752
Do you know what I found?

16:01.127 --> 16:04.213
In Zimia, it all goes through
one underground market,

16:04.214 --> 16:07.424
run by a gang of Arrakian smugglers.

16:07.425 --> 16:11.304
Whale fur, weapons, spice.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.472
Which means?

16:13.473 --> 16:15.015
I don't know. This is your story.

16:15.016 --> 16:17.060
- What does it mean?
- The rebels!

16:17.811 --> 16:20.979
They must've gone through
the underground market.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.565
They must've gone

16:23.983 --> 16:25.651
through the underground market.

16:25.652 --> 16:30.239
To sell the spice, to raise the solari,
to buy the thinking machine.

16:30.240 --> 16:35.537
I'd wager, if you visit
some of these smugglers and

16:38.373 --> 16:41.418
win them over with your renowned charms,

16:44.587 --> 16:47.172
they'll tell you exactly who
the insurgents are and where to find them.

16:47.173 --> 16:49.509
And who they're in league with.

17:04.941 --> 17:09.153
It's a start, but to clear your name,

17:09.154 --> 17:11.740
I'll need proof
that your aunt is involved.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.767
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

17:39.768 --> 17:42.478
The Spacing Guild have been known
to monitor dispatches.

17:42.479 --> 17:43.937
I couldn't risk your mission with them

17:43.938 --> 17:46.190
and I couldn't risk
the Emperor finding out

17:46.191 --> 17:47.483
that I'd summoned you.

17:47.484 --> 17:50.445
The situation is too precarious.

17:51.571 --> 17:55.575
Francesca, what happened to Kasha
was just the beginning.

18:01.790 --> 18:04.000
We have been sidelined.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.879
The Emperor refuses a Truthsayer.

18:10.632 --> 18:14.511
And his new Bashar is leading him
on a despotic path.

18:15.970 --> 18:18.848
This is the reckoning Raquella spoke of?

18:19.974 --> 18:21.351
Yes.

18:21.851 --> 18:24.853
But he may be only the tip of the spear.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.481
What does Tula have to say?

18:27.065 --> 18:30.151
Tula stands by my side,
as she has always done it.

18:31.111 --> 18:34.989
If she was here, she would tell you,
we must act.

18:35.740 --> 18:38.702
I'm going to eliminate Desmond Hart.
That's already in progress.

18:39.285 --> 18:44.832
What I need you to do when that happens
is to guide Corrino back to us

18:44.833 --> 18:48.544
and convince him to allow Ynez
to study on Wallach IX.

18:48.545 --> 18:50.005
And Constantine?

18:51.589 --> 18:54.174
- He was just a ruse?
- The Emperor has yet

18:54.175 --> 18:57.012
to appoint a commander of his new fleet.

18:59.389 --> 19:01.181
I think it would be wise
if the son of a Sister

19:01.182 --> 19:03.768
was in charge of that most vital asset.

19:05.145 --> 19:08.273
The odds of my success are low
if the new Bashar is in my way.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.859
He won't be in your way.

19:11.735 --> 19:13.486
I'm gonna keep him occupied.

19:31.296 --> 19:32.964
Swordmaster?

19:49.856 --> 19:51.900
We're looking for insurgents.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.529
You want to come?

20:01.159 --> 20:03.411
I didn't realize you had a dance lesson.

20:04.412 --> 20:05.622
My Lord.

20:06.998 --> 20:08.625
Maybe next time.

20:18.677 --> 20:20.428
Ready to get put on your ass, Atreides?

20:26.351 --> 20:28.436
- En guard.
- You're late again.

20:29.020 --> 20:30.104
Yeah, well, my mother--

20:30.105 --> 20:32.231
Stop making excuses for yourself,
Constantine.

20:32.232 --> 20:33.482
You want your father's respect?

20:33.483 --> 20:35.651
Start there.
Take some responsibility.

20:35.652 --> 20:38.195
This training could save your life.

20:38.196 --> 20:40.739
But I will not teach you
if you don't take it seriously.

20:40.740 --> 20:43.660
That's it.
That's your lesson for today.

21:01.928 --> 21:04.638
Mikaela! You have to get off planet.

21:04.639 --> 21:07.017
The Emperor's new police dogs
are out in force.

21:08.143 --> 21:10.519
Alright, let's get your heart rate
to where it should be.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.063
They're all over the port,
Mikaela, roustin' smugglers.

21:13.064 --> 21:14.690
It's only a matter of time

21:14.691 --> 21:16.233
before he tears someone in half
and leads them here.

21:16.234 --> 21:17.943
- You have to go, now.
- Okay.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.488
And what about you?
- My cover's not blown.

21:23.533 --> 21:26.745
I've spent years gettin' to that position.

21:28.246 --> 21:29.997
It'd be foolish of me to burn it now.

21:29.998 --> 21:32.000
And this would have nothing
to do with the Princess?

21:32.876 --> 21:35.085
I've been doing this
a lot longer than you have.

21:35.086 --> 21:37.171
And I'll give you some advice.

21:37.172 --> 21:38.839
Do not ever make the mistake of thinking

21:38.840 --> 21:41.718
you can become the man
you are pretending to be.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.638
Even if that man's better than me?

21:46.639 --> 21:48.266
Especially then.

21:53.980 --> 21:56.941
Come on.
Horace would want you to be safe.

21:59.027 --> 22:03.156
If you think Horace would want me to run,
you obviously didn't know him that well.

22:05.158 --> 22:06.825
Chain detonators.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.535
How did you get those?

22:08.536 --> 22:10.914
I have my own sources, Atreides.

22:11.414 --> 22:13.040
Let Desmond Hart come.

22:13.041 --> 22:15.377
I'm preparing quite a worthy greeting.

22:39.401 --> 22:40.694
From Mother Superior.

23:05.260 --> 23:06.845
I said goodbye to you.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.097
We all did.

23:11.266 --> 23:13.101
They told us it was the only way.

23:15.103 --> 23:16.895
I should've done more.

23:16.896 --> 23:18.231
It's not your fault.

23:19.691 --> 23:21.317
You tried to warn me.

23:22.652 --> 23:24.279
You were right.

23:25.363 --> 23:27.365
The Sisterhood is in trouble.

23:28.199 --> 23:29.784
I don't know where to begin.

23:32.245 --> 23:35.581
The nightmares came
and everyone all saw the same thing.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.625
The gaping maw of Shai-Hulud,

23:38.668 --> 23:42.004
swallowed by darkness
until two eyes stared back.

23:42.005 --> 23:43.922
Wait.
You had the nightmare, too?

23:43.923 --> 23:45.300
It wasn't a nightmare.

23:46.259 --> 23:47.635
It was prescience.

23:49.679 --> 23:54.142
I foresaw the reckoning
that would drive the Imperium to tyranny.

23:54.684 --> 23:56.978
If he succeeds,

23:58.313 --> 24:02.192
humanity will backslide
into self-destruction.

24:02.901 --> 24:05.528
You saw all of that during the Agony?

24:07.864 --> 24:09.616
On my deathbed.

24:12.410 --> 24:13.787
Where is Valya?

24:17.540 --> 24:19.167
You're not Lila.

24:29.094 --> 24:30.345
Lila.

24:32.013 --> 24:33.640
You should be resting.

24:35.725 --> 24:37.435
I thought I told you
to keep her downstairs.

24:38.186 --> 24:41.648
Sister Tula,
this station is an absolute mess.

24:43.817 --> 24:49.655
You clearly resorted to unorthodox methods
to access my knowledge and now I'm here.

24:49.656 --> 24:50.782
Let's get to work.

24:51.825 --> 24:53.243
Mother Raquella?

24:54.327 --> 24:56.329
Staring will only squander
this opportunity.

24:58.832 --> 25:01.041
I don't know how long I have in control.

25:01.042 --> 25:02.127
Sister?

25:05.338 --> 25:07.506
I need you to track the data.

25:07.507 --> 25:09.009
Look for patterns.

25:10.468 --> 25:13.429
Samples of Sister Kasha's brain stem?

25:13.430 --> 25:14.931
Correct.

25:15.849 --> 25:18.059
The Mother School is still standing.

25:20.353 --> 25:22.022
That gives me some relief.

25:22.439 --> 25:26.276
Valya has increased our numbers
and our influence.

25:27.027 --> 25:30.696
And she has protected the beating heart
of the Sisterhood.

25:30.697 --> 25:33.783
Well, then she's been faithful
to her mission.

25:34.367 --> 25:37.036
It wasn't wrong for me to task her,

25:37.037 --> 25:39.748
even if it risks splitting the Sisterhood
down the middle.

25:42.751 --> 25:45.587
I feared my Great Work would be lost.

25:46.588 --> 25:49.507
- What Great Work?
- Not the time for questions, Sister Jen.

25:50.008 --> 25:52.092
My granddaughter, Dorotea,

25:52.093 --> 25:57.349
did she and Valya
ever resolve their differences?

26:05.023 --> 26:06.232
I see.

26:13.448 --> 26:16.618
Your sister's will never wanes.

26:30.632 --> 26:32.424
There's tissue damage.
I've seen this before.

26:32.425 --> 26:33.676
- You have?
- During the war.

26:33.677 --> 26:34.761
Sister?

26:35.220 --> 26:36.638
Get me a new sample.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.366
You're back.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.494
Did the lead I gave you help?

26:59.994 --> 27:01.621
Hart was grateful.

27:02.080 --> 27:04.748
If he gets what he needs
from these smugglers,

27:04.749 --> 27:07.961
I'm hopeful the acrimony between us
will be forgotten.

27:08.586 --> 27:09.629
It won't.

27:10.547 --> 27:14.175
But we can use his distrust
to your advantage.

27:15.802 --> 27:18.263
He did have a lot to say about you
and your Sisterhood.

27:19.180 --> 27:21.182
Asked if I knew what you were up to.

27:22.892 --> 27:24.436
What are you up to?

27:25.311 --> 27:27.271
What we're always up to, Harrow.

27:27.272 --> 27:29.232
Serving the Imperium.

27:31.234 --> 27:34.403
Your eagerness to help the Bashar

27:34.404 --> 27:38.074
will get House Harkonnen
back into the Emperor's good graces.

27:39.159 --> 27:41.453
You've wanted this your entire life.

27:41.870 --> 27:45.165
And here I am, gifting it to you.

27:46.291 --> 27:49.794
If I only had a Truthsayer
to tell me if you're sincere or not.

27:50.795 --> 27:52.797
Well, you'll just have to trust me.

28:11.066 --> 28:14.736
I must go.
My ship departs in a few hours.

28:15.320 --> 28:17.279
You sure you don't want to
come with me to lay

28:17.280 --> 28:20.157
dear Uncle Evgeny
to rest among our ancestors?

28:20.158 --> 28:22.118
I already said my goodbyes.

28:23.161 --> 28:25.705
I'm sure every word brought him peace.

28:27.916 --> 28:29.751
I'll send your regards to Lankiveil.

28:30.543 --> 28:32.504
Consider this your home while I'm gone.

28:41.304 --> 28:42.555
I don't understand.

28:43.098 --> 28:46.059
The decision to lead
Desmond Hart to the rebels.

28:46.851 --> 28:48.978
How does Sister Francesca factor in?

28:50.897 --> 28:54.484
One day, you and the others
will learn the art of imprinting.

28:54.984 --> 28:59.114
Making an impression so strong,
it alters the course of someone's life.

28:59.489 --> 29:03.326
It is an emotional and physical bond
that never breaks.

29:09.040 --> 29:10.834
<i>What do you want, Francesca?</i>

29:14.170 --> 29:17.506
I want you to stop managing our son
and start supporting him.

29:17.507 --> 29:21.219
Test him with some real responsibility.

29:22.429 --> 29:24.096
Well, that boy would rather
gallivant his way

29:24.097 --> 29:27.392
through all the private bedchambers
of the Great Houses than lead.

29:27.976 --> 29:30.936
He shows no desire, no initiative.

29:30.937 --> 29:33.981
You had a similar reputation
in your youth,

29:33.982 --> 29:37.444
which I believe was also very frustrating
to your father.

29:37.986 --> 29:40.071
Don't leave yourself out of the story.

29:40.697 --> 29:42.699
I had my support from you.

29:45.535 --> 29:47.787
Give our son his opportunity, Javicco.

29:48.538 --> 29:50.749
It will draw out the best in him.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.210
Make him prove himself.

29:57.213 --> 30:01.426
And he'll become a man
as capable and formidable as you are now.

30:22.906 --> 30:26.368
I didn't come here to drive a wedge
between you and your wife, Javicco.

30:58.066 --> 31:00.067
During the Omnius Plague,

31:00.068 --> 31:02.487
the machines designed a pathogen

31:02.987 --> 31:05.155
that incubated in the human body,

31:05.156 --> 31:08.535
releasing an enzyme
that infected the liver.

31:09.536 --> 31:12.538
This enzyme has similar properties,

31:12.539 --> 31:16.584
but it has concentrated itself
in Kasha's amygdala.

31:18.044 --> 31:19.671
The fear center.

31:20.255 --> 31:22.632
We believe that's where the damage began.

31:26.886 --> 31:29.556
I said I was not to be disturbed
unless it's an emergency.

31:30.598 --> 31:33.727
- What's going on in there?
- It's not safe for you.

31:34.394 --> 31:36.562
- Who's in there with you?
- That is not your concern.

31:36.563 --> 31:38.022
My concern?

31:38.023 --> 31:40.442
Do you even know
what's happening in this school?

31:40.859 --> 31:43.193
Students are demanding to be sent home.

31:43.194 --> 31:45.863
They are fleeing in fear.

31:45.864 --> 31:50.409
Wait until they tell their families that
the acting proctor was completely absent.

31:50.410 --> 31:52.662
Sister Avila, you forget your place.

31:54.330 --> 31:56.291
From Mother Superior Valya.

31:59.711 --> 32:03.172
Tula, this is a virus.

32:03.173 --> 32:05.591
The nightmares, the deaths,

32:05.592 --> 32:07.801
they're connected
to a genetically modified

32:07.802 --> 32:11.056
airborne RNA retrovirus.

32:12.432 --> 32:13.558
Sister Avila.

32:17.228 --> 32:19.938
What kind of abomination is this?

32:19.939 --> 32:21.649
I found a way to save her.

32:23.902 --> 32:27.279
Sister Lila is still in recovery.

32:27.280 --> 32:29.156
And does Valya know about this?

32:29.157 --> 32:32.243
I am doing as I was tasked to do,

32:33.536 --> 32:35.204
to protect the Sisterhood at all costs.

32:35.205 --> 32:37.790
- Is that not your aim?
- Of course, it is, but I--

32:37.791 --> 32:39.876
Good! Then we are in agreement.

32:41.086 --> 32:42.337
You may go now.

32:43.213 --> 32:45.298
Don't mention a word of this to anyone, understood?

33:27.382 --> 33:29.592
The new Bashar. Welcome.

33:31.344 --> 33:34.723
How 'bout a little taste? On the house?

33:36.182 --> 33:40.437
I hope you haven't been relying on any
illegal shipments of spice, have you?

33:41.146 --> 33:42.605
Because...

33:43.523 --> 33:45.816
as it happens...

33:45.817 --> 33:47.861
I just spoke to a smuggler.

33:48.236 --> 33:51.990
Unfortunately, for him,
most of what he said was screaming.

33:53.033 --> 33:55.660
But he told me something very interesting.

33:57.203 --> 34:02.708
He said this place is a hotbed
for insurgent activity.

34:02.709 --> 34:05.711
And he said that the spice
he's been smuggling in

34:05.712 --> 34:07.547
has been paying for the party.

34:09.466 --> 34:11.468
That make any sense to you?

34:12.344 --> 34:14.262
No, it doesn't.

34:18.141 --> 34:19.142
Okay.

34:55.428 --> 34:57.430
Do you know what strikes me as odd?

34:58.056 --> 34:59.431
Is the fact that you are here.

34:59.432 --> 35:02.059
A Fremen, profiting,

35:02.060 --> 35:04.478
off the rape of your own planet,

35:04.479 --> 35:07.773
communing with your oppressors.

35:07.774 --> 35:09.692
I found a different way to survive.

35:09.693 --> 35:11.903
Or a different way to kill.

35:13.488 --> 35:15.156
What I really want to know

35:15.573 --> 35:18.576
is how the Sisterhood is connected
to the rebellion.

35:19.285 --> 35:22.205
You give me something I can use,

35:23.164 --> 35:24.958
I shall spare your life.

35:27.168 --> 35:30.005
God created Arrakis to train the faithful.

35:30.880 --> 35:32.090
I live here.

35:40.432 --> 35:42.475
Let's go see what's upstairs, shall we?

35:47.814 --> 35:49.149
Keep an eye on her.

37:16.528 --> 37:18.238
Stay behind me. Let's go.

37:38.758 --> 37:39.843
Go!

38:34.606 --> 38:36.733
I've seen a knife like that before.

38:37.901 --> 38:39.235
Sister.

38:46.618 --> 38:47.744
You lied to us.

38:50.163 --> 38:52.582
Everyone has secrets, Atreides.

38:53.500 --> 38:56.503
The Sisterhood stands
with what's best for the Imperium

38:57.462 --> 38:58.797
just like you.

38:59.798 --> 39:03.133
And where do your people on Arrakis
fit into those grand plans?

39:03.134 --> 39:05.178
Are you willing to let them burn?

39:12.060 --> 39:14.062
Don't let me see you again.

39:36.459 --> 39:38.962
She's asleep. Good.

39:46.594 --> 39:49.431
If Raquella returns, let me know.

39:56.688 --> 39:59.399
Is Lila just being used
for the Sisterhood's gain?

40:00.567 --> 40:02.484
We're in a time of crisis, Sister Jen.

40:02.485 --> 40:05.947
- Sacrifices have to be made.
- And what have you sacrificed?

40:10.910 --> 40:12.912
More than you can ever imagine.

41:27.946 --> 41:29.948
I've been looking for you.

41:34.285 --> 41:38.915
All my life, I've had to learn
about the great Corrinos:

41:39.958 --> 41:43.169
Roderick, Jules.
And the Butlers before them.

41:45.255 --> 41:48.008
But I don't know anything
about your family.

41:49.092 --> 41:52.470
Your Sisterhood does everything
with a purpose, right?

41:53.138 --> 41:55.140
A grand plan.

41:57.851 --> 42:00.478
That's always our intention.

42:01.146 --> 42:02.147
Yes.

42:03.940 --> 42:06.192
What was your purpose in having me?

42:09.946 --> 42:12.990
- Constantine!
- What was your purpose in having me?

42:12.991 --> 42:17.287
You left me to be raised by a father
who can't stand me and never will.

42:20.623 --> 42:22.625
What's the purpose in that?

42:32.510 --> 42:34.512
Sorry, I don't have a glass for you.

42:40.226 --> 42:43.229
You have to see your father
for the man he really is.

42:44.481 --> 42:47.108
A man who can never be pleased.

42:47.692 --> 42:49.527
A man who's driven by fear.

42:51.404 --> 42:53.864
You, on the other hand,

42:53.865 --> 42:55.783
have never cared
what anyone thinks of you.

42:55.784 --> 42:58.994
- And all to what end?
- There will be opportunities.

42:58.995 --> 43:02.165
When they come,
reach for them with confidence.

43:02.999 --> 43:05.210
Yeah, I'll reach for them.

43:06.336 --> 43:10.090
You want the truth?
Your purpose, Constantine.

43:10.882 --> 43:14.135
The reason you were brought
into this world

43:15.970 --> 43:17.972
is to protect your sister,

43:20.016 --> 43:22.142
the future leader of the Imperium,

43:22.143 --> 43:25.230
from anyone who seeks to do her harm.

43:30.694 --> 43:33.279
Including the ones who claim to love her.

43:47.669 --> 43:50.379
<i>What do you mean
Desmond Hart survived?</i>

43:50.380 --> 43:51.964
<i>How is that possible?</i>

43:51.965 --> 43:55.134
I don't know how,
but he wasn't among the dead.

43:55.135 --> 43:56.510
So be it.

43:56.511 --> 43:58.513
There's a contingency plan for him.

43:58.888 --> 44:04.184
I've just had to destroy
everything that I've built.

44:04.185 --> 44:05.853
This is years of investment.

44:05.854 --> 44:09.024
- What, and you're just--
- Your investment wasn't wasted.

44:09.899 --> 44:13.527
We needed to occupy our enemies,
so that Francesca could maneuver.

44:13.528 --> 44:16.530
Let's hope she took good advantage.

44:16.531 --> 44:18.741
You can hold your head up high, Mikaela.

44:18.742 --> 44:21.201
It's not my performance that
I'm doubting, Mother Superior.

44:21.202 --> 44:24.289
Careful how you finish that sentence.

44:37.552 --> 44:40.764
This will get you to our safe house
on Arrakis.

44:47.062 --> 44:50.522
I won't betray my people
the same way I did Horace and the others.

44:50.523 --> 44:52.734
The Sisterhood is your people.

44:54.736 --> 44:56.946
I see you're molding
this one in your image.

45:03.411 --> 45:06.373
Let's see how long you remain this naive, acolyte.

46:25.076 --> 46:26.703
There he is.

46:28.329 --> 46:30.957
Constantine. Didn't see you there.

46:33.501 --> 46:37.463
Listen, about earlier,
I never meant to--

46:37.464 --> 46:39.382
I'm actually here to thank you,

46:40.300 --> 46:41.926
for your concern.

46:42.552 --> 46:44.179
And for all you've done for me.

46:46.222 --> 46:49.059
For all you've tried to teach me.

46:51.936 --> 46:54.772
It's okay. It's my duty.

46:54.773 --> 46:56.440
You've gone beyond your duty.

46:56.441 --> 46:58.526
You have reminded me of my purpose.

46:59.569 --> 47:02.196
Well, glad you appreciate it.

47:02.197 --> 47:05.283
I much more than appreciate it, friend.

47:07.786 --> 47:09.621
I love you for it.

47:43.780 --> 47:47.366
No one needs a reason to dine
with good friends,

47:47.367 --> 47:49.911
but tonight is truly a special occasion.

47:50.578 --> 47:52.372
Would you stand, Constantine?

47:56.960 --> 48:00.546
It is with great pride
that I share with you all some news.

48:00.547 --> 48:04.258
Because of my son's
quick and decisive action,

48:04.259 --> 48:06.970
we have apprehended
a traitor in our house.

48:08.972 --> 48:10.389
Our Swordmaster,

48:10.390 --> 48:13.601
who I thought served us well.

48:14.269 --> 48:16.896
But he will be made an example of.

48:17.605 --> 48:20.816
House Corrino will tolerate no treachery.

48:20.817 --> 48:24.070
Constantine knows that,
and for that, I thank him.

48:26.948 --> 48:27.907
Shall we?

48:31.786 --> 48:36.833
In recognition of the man you've become,
I bestow upon you a great honor.

48:37.375 --> 48:40.587
I have chosen you, my son,

48:41.129 --> 48:42.505
to command my fleet,

48:43.131 --> 48:44.757
to deploy to Arrakis,

48:44.758 --> 48:47.885
and to ensure House Corrino
brings stability to the planet

48:47.886 --> 48:49.637
and spice to the Imperium.

48:50.513 --> 48:53.767
And I know your mother
is as proud of you as I am.

48:59.397 --> 49:00.482
Congratulations.

49:10.658 --> 49:12.869
- Good work, my boy.
- Thank you.

50:27.569 --> 50:29.195
Tell me the truth.

50:30.655 --> 50:32.449
Was everything a lie?

50:33.533 --> 50:34.868
I care about you.

50:35.368 --> 50:37.037
You tried to kill my family.

50:38.079 --> 50:39.747
I couldn't go through with it.

50:39.748 --> 50:42.417
I chose you over my principles.

50:43.001 --> 50:45.211
But I am willing to die for them anyway.

50:46.046 --> 50:49.841
Do you really believe
you can bring about a better Imperium?

50:52.218 --> 50:53.636
I do.

51:24.125 --> 51:25.251
You okay?

51:27.003 --> 51:30.340
I felt her, Mother Raquella

51:31.383 --> 51:32.716
moving through me.

51:32.717 --> 51:34.010
Yeah.

51:35.220 --> 51:36.846
We saw.

51:38.640 --> 51:40.266
Did we get what we needed?

51:41.434 --> 51:43.520
Seems like we did, Doe Eyes.

51:48.441 --> 51:50.025
Where's Mother Tula?

51:50.026 --> 51:52.653
She's just checking a message
from Mother Superior Valya.

51:52.654 --> 51:54.364
She'll be back. Don't worry.

51:55.532 --> 51:57.742
I'm just glad I didn't let everyone down.

51:58.410 --> 52:00.412
How could you let everyone down?

52:02.330 --> 52:04.332
You're the bravest among us.

52:05.083 --> 52:06.710
You've done your part.

52:10.964 --> 52:12.716
Get some rest.

52:25.937 --> 52:28.272
<i>Sister, along with this message,</i>

52:28.273 --> 52:31.025
<i>I've enclosed a genetic
sample of this man,</i>

52:31.026 --> 52:32.360
<i>Desmond Hart.</i>

52:34.362 --> 52:36.364
<i>Run it as soon as possible.</i>

52:37.949 --> 52:40.326
<i>He has a power I cannot account for.</i>

52:42.829 --> 52:46.416
<i>To understand it,
we must identify his bloodlines.</i>

52:51.338 --> 52:53.590
<i>Processing DNA sample.</i>

53:00.138 --> 53:02.724
<i>Accessing genetic library.</i>

53:18.823 --> 53:21.034
I should've died tonight.

53:21.910 --> 53:25.080
"Each man must face his own conscience
and his own testing."

53:27.916 --> 53:30.627
"Shai-Hulud makes the final choice."

53:35.632 --> 53:37.300
You've been chosen.

53:39.928 --> 53:41.554
I was chosen, too.

53:42.514 --> 53:46.726
To lead a legion of worlds into
the Imperium and forge a new future.

53:48.728 --> 53:53.233
And then the Sisterhood
wrested it all away from me.

53:55.694 --> 53:57.904
<i>My husband's trust,</i>

54:01.533 --> 54:03.910
<i>my daughter's love,</i>

54:04.911 --> 54:06.079
<i>my power.</i>

54:17.048 --> 54:18.049
<i>Tell me.</i>

54:27.851 --> 54:29.853
What did they do to you?

54:31.855 --> 54:34.274
<i>Bloodline, Atreides.</i>

54:36.568 --> 54:38.778
<i>Bloodline, Harkonnen.</i>

54:48.121 --> 54:51.082
<i>Match identified.</i>

55:06.681 --> 55:08.850
The woman who gave birth to me

55:10.560 --> 55:14.313
sent me away to live among scavengers,

55:14.314 --> 55:17.400
who left me fighting for scraps
just to survive.

55:20.862 --> 55:22.697
She was a Sister.

55:51.601 --> 55:55.188
Let us rid the Imperium
of these witches forever.
