["It'’s Beginning to Look
A Lot Like Christmas" playing]

00:50.398 --> 00:52.878
[inflatable deflating][song distorts, slow]

00:57.144 --> 00:59.972
[father]
I can'’t just manifest
a tree topper.

01:00.147 --> 01:03.237
[mother] Okay. Okay.
You don'’t need to give every
example of what you can'’t do.

01:03.411 --> 01:04.934
[father]
Why is this stuff so important?

01:05.108 --> 01:06.414
[mother] Because!

01:06.588 --> 01:08.198
It'’s been a hard year.

01:08.894 --> 01:10.766
The move, a new school.

01:10.940 --> 01:13.638
I mean, God, I just want it
to be special for Liam.

01:13.812 --> 01:18.339
[father sighs]
I get it. I just don'’t know
where the tree topper is, okay?

01:18.513 --> 01:22.256
I can'’t magically make a box
with a-a star appear.

01:22.430 --> 01:24.910
And for the tenth time,
it'’s not a star,
it'’s an angel.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.043
- Oh, an angel.
- Yes, it'’s an angel.

01:27.217 --> 01:28.740
- Okay.
- And every year,

01:28.914 --> 01:30.655
it sits
on top of the tree, okay?

01:30.829 --> 01:33.397
And it looks down upon us
like it'’s a guardian angel.

01:33.571 --> 01:35.878
Oh. [scoffs]
- A guardian angel.
- Yeah.

01:36.052 --> 01:38.185
Well, maybe
we need a new one anyway.

01:38.359 --> 01:40.665
The old one wasn'’t doing
that great of a job, was it?

01:42.537 --> 01:43.712
Wow.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.903
Okay, so it'’s just vanished.
It'’s completely gone.[sighs]

02:01.077 --> 02:02.383
Missing in action.

02:02.557 --> 02:05.125
For once in your life,
can you just let it go?

02:05.299 --> 02:06.430
- Yeah.
- For once?

02:06.604 --> 02:08.215
- Can you do that?
- Yes, I can

02:08.389 --> 02:10.347
when you admit
that you screwed up, okay?
How about that?

02:10.521 --> 02:13.481
Oh, I get it.
As long as I take the blame
for every little thing that ha--

02:13.655 --> 02:14.656
Hey, guys.

02:16.048 --> 02:18.442
Wow! It looks amazing in here.

02:18.616 --> 02:20.792
Thank you, honey.
Thank you.

02:20.966 --> 02:22.229
I was just looking for...
[sniffles]

02:22.403 --> 02:24.100
...for the tree topper
that your father lost,

02:24.274 --> 02:26.537
and I just got a little bit
- of tinsel in my eye.
- Unbelievable.

02:26.711 --> 02:28.409
But I'’m not crying,
because everything is great.

02:28.583 --> 02:30.324
We'’re gonna have
a great Christmas.
[sniffles]

02:30.498 --> 02:32.761
Tree toppers?
Come on, Mom.

02:32.935 --> 02:37.461
Christmas isn'’t about
tree toppers and ornaments
and all that stupid stuff.

02:37.635 --> 02:42.292
It'’s about togetherness
and music and...

02:43.772 --> 02:45.252
Hey, guess what
I was doing upstairs.

02:45.426 --> 02:46.514
What were you
doing upstairs?

02:46.688 --> 02:48.255
Writing my letter to Santa.

02:48.429 --> 02:50.126
- Really? You were?
- Mm-hmm.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.780
Letter to Santa?

02:51.954 --> 02:54.348
Aren'’t you getting
a little too old for that?

02:54.522 --> 02:58.917
Oh, no, no.
What-What your dad means
is just that sometimes,

02:59.091 --> 03:03.139
Santa is too busy responding
to letters
from all of the little kids

03:03.313 --> 03:05.968
that then he doesn'’t always
have the time to respond to
the letters

03:06.142 --> 03:07.317
from the big kids too.

03:07.491 --> 03:09.450
No, that'’s not at all
what I meant.

03:09.624 --> 03:10.886
Bill, just...

03:12.148 --> 03:13.671
I'’ve always written
letters to Santa.

03:13.845 --> 03:15.717
How else will he know
what I want for Christmas?

03:15.891 --> 03:17.414
Exactly, honey.

03:17.588 --> 03:19.373
I think
it'’s absolutely wonderful.

03:19.547 --> 03:20.896
Not all of us are a scrooge.

03:21.070 --> 03:23.768
No, I--
I'’m not a scrooge.

03:23.942 --> 03:25.074
I just...

03:26.858 --> 03:30.862
Look, I know how hard it is
being the new kid in town.

03:31.036 --> 03:34.431
And as it is, school presents
challenges for you
because of your learning dis--

03:34.605 --> 03:35.737
Differences.

03:36.651 --> 03:38.305
Learning differences.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.785
[Bill]
Right, learning differences.

03:40.959 --> 03:45.660
Which is good,
but even more reason
not to write certain letters.

03:45.834 --> 03:48.010
Because that way,
when you go to meet
other sixth-graders

03:48.184 --> 03:49.098
and try to make friends,

03:49.272 --> 03:50.665
you won'’t get, uh...

03:52.362 --> 03:53.276
beaten up.

03:53.450 --> 03:54.756
[sighs]

03:54.930 --> 03:58.455
What are you saying?
I have a friend-- friends.

03:58.629 --> 04:00.805
Really?
Well, I didn'’t know that.

04:00.979 --> 04:03.417
Mom, I'’ve been at that school
for, like, three months.

04:03.591 --> 04:04.766
Why wouldn'’t I have friends?

04:05.723 --> 04:07.377
Just because of
social distancing.

04:08.509 --> 04:10.467
Come on, Mom.
That ended two years ago.

04:10.641 --> 04:12.600
And I do have friends.

04:12.774 --> 04:15.472
My friend Gibby'’s
about one of
the most popular kids in school.

04:15.646 --> 04:17.648
We play football at recess
and everything.
[chuckles]

04:17.822 --> 04:18.823
Play football?

04:19.476 --> 04:21.173
Yeah.

04:21.348 --> 04:22.566
That'’s what I just said.

04:23.132 --> 04:24.438
Nice.

04:24.612 --> 04:25.526
[mother] Gibby!

04:25.700 --> 04:26.614
Ow.

04:26.788 --> 04:29.704
Gibby! Gibby!

04:30.487 --> 04:32.359
I'’m so proud of you.

04:32.533 --> 04:34.317
Why'’d you tell them
we play football?

04:34.491 --> 04:35.927
We don'’t even have
a football team.

04:36.101 --> 04:37.929
We'’re 11.

04:38.103 --> 04:41.542
I didn'’t say we were on a team.
I just said we played at recess.

04:41.716 --> 04:43.457
What kind of football
do we play?

04:44.806 --> 04:48.244
[blows raspberry]
Flag football, I guess.

04:48.418 --> 04:50.551
Plus, they'’re not gonna
waterboard us about this.

04:50.725 --> 04:52.030
You don'’t know that.

04:52.204 --> 04:54.032
Parents can be weird.
They like to know stuff.

04:54.946 --> 04:56.731
What position
should I say I play?

04:58.123 --> 05:00.082
You'’re the kicker.

05:01.997 --> 05:03.868
Am I like the guy
who kicks it real high

05:04.042 --> 05:07.263
or the guy who tries to
get the ball
through the things?

05:08.395 --> 05:10.222
The field goal kicker.

05:10.397 --> 05:13.313
Okay, cool. You know the game,
so we won'’t get tripped up.

05:14.662 --> 05:16.577
Oh, and one more thing.

05:16.751 --> 05:19.928
I also told them
you have cancer.

05:20.102 --> 05:21.843
What? Why?

05:23.018 --> 05:24.715
My parents know
I don'’t make friends easily,

05:24.889 --> 05:28.153
so to make it real,

05:28.328 --> 05:30.591
I told them I was nice
to a kid with cancer

05:30.765 --> 05:32.375
and he was nice to me back.

05:32.549 --> 05:34.421
But we are friends.

05:34.595 --> 05:36.466
Why'’d you have to
make anything up?

05:38.207 --> 05:40.296
[sighs]
Hindsight is twenty-twenty.

05:45.475 --> 05:47.347
The point is,
if you meet my parents,

05:47.521 --> 05:49.784
just make sure
you act a little cancer-y.

05:50.567 --> 05:51.568
Will do.

05:53.614 --> 05:55.442
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

05:55.616 --> 05:57.226
Hold your horses, hotshot.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.141
What do you think you'’re doing?

05:59.315 --> 06:00.925
Um, crossing the street?

06:01.099 --> 06:03.363
I'’ll tell you
when you can cross the street.

06:04.189 --> 06:05.408
But there are no cars.

06:05.582 --> 06:07.584
[gasps] When did you finish

06:07.758 --> 06:11.066
your two-hour
crossing guard
certification course?

06:11.240 --> 06:12.459
I didn'’t.

06:12.633 --> 06:14.417
Oh, that'’s right.

06:14.591 --> 06:15.897
That was me.

06:16.071 --> 06:18.769
So I'’ll tell you
when there are no cars.

06:28.518 --> 06:30.781
Go. Go ahead.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.567
Mr. "I'’m In A Hurry At First."

06:33.741 --> 06:36.004
Where'’d he go? Bring him back.

06:36.178 --> 06:37.962
- Good morning, ladies.
- Hello.

06:38.136 --> 06:39.790
- Hi.
- Hello.

06:39.964 --> 06:41.488
[bell ringing][sighs]

06:44.839 --> 06:45.927
There she is.

06:46.101 --> 06:48.495
["I Want To Be Your Man"
playing]

06:48.669 --> 06:50.714
[chattering]

07:07.514 --> 07:08.863
Legit question.

07:09.037 --> 07:12.083
Why are you staring
at someone you cannot get?

07:13.302 --> 07:15.435
What, Emma?
We have a ton in common.

07:15.609 --> 07:16.610
Like?

07:18.046 --> 07:19.787
We both like cats.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.353
That'’s a ton?

07:21.528 --> 07:23.617
We can build off that.

07:23.791 --> 07:25.662
What'’s so great
about her anyway?

07:25.836 --> 07:27.403
You only like her
'’cause she'’s pretty.

07:27.577 --> 07:29.231
What? No.

07:29.405 --> 07:32.582
I like her
'’cause whenever I look at her,
she smiles.

07:32.756 --> 07:35.672
Big deal. Smiling'’s easy
when you have nice teeth.

07:35.846 --> 07:37.848
And she'’s kind.

07:38.022 --> 07:39.894
People that pretty
are usually mean.

07:40.547 --> 07:41.635
Yeah, I guess.

07:41.809 --> 07:43.593
She does have a lot of friends.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.424
Pray for me.

07:48.598 --> 07:50.861
No. Liam. Get-- Abort!

07:51.035 --> 07:53.473
["I Want To Be Your Man"
continues playing]

07:56.824 --> 07:58.042
[stammers]

07:59.348 --> 08:01.350
I like the cat stickers
on your locker.

08:01.916 --> 08:02.743
Thank you.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.919
My cat licks her nipples.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.139
Well, that'’s pretty random.

08:08.313 --> 08:10.054
[chuckles]
Yeah, that was pretty random.

08:10.228 --> 08:12.230
Um, by the way,
do you like Post Malone?

08:12.404 --> 08:13.797
Love him.

08:13.971 --> 08:15.843
Don'’t you remember
when Mr. Charles asked me

08:16.017 --> 08:19.063
to name
my favorite piece of writing,
and I said "Congratulations"?

08:19.237 --> 08:23.981
Yeah. Well, he'’s in town
doing a concert.
Maybe we could--

08:24.155 --> 08:25.156
What'’s up, E?

08:25.330 --> 08:26.157
Hey, Aiden.

08:26.331 --> 08:27.855
- How are you?
- Good.

08:29.160 --> 08:30.771
- [Aiden] Whoa.
- Uh...

08:30.945 --> 08:32.207
What do you think you'’re doing?

08:32.381 --> 08:34.339
Oh, nothing really.
I was actually just...

08:34.514 --> 08:35.993
You trying to hit on my girl?

08:36.167 --> 08:37.560
Aiden, stop that.

08:38.692 --> 08:40.824
- Well, were you?
- No, no, no, no.

08:40.998 --> 08:44.785
No. No. I was just trying to
tell her about my cat'’s nipples.

08:44.959 --> 08:47.439
Your cat'’s nipple--
Bro, what are you talking about?

08:47.614 --> 08:49.485
And other stuff.

08:50.181 --> 08:52.706
Uh, tootles.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.055
Uh...

08:54.229 --> 08:57.754
I never say tootles,
just FYI.

08:58.712 --> 09:00.148
That was my first time.

09:01.366 --> 09:02.411
Okay.

09:04.326 --> 09:05.457
Darn it!

09:07.938 --> 09:09.113
How'’d it go?

09:10.985 --> 09:13.161
I might have to
change schools again.

09:14.423 --> 09:18.427
My pupils,
focus your pupils on me

09:18.601 --> 09:21.735
as I mold your malleable minds.

09:21.909 --> 09:26.174
As I massage the clay
that is your cerebellum.

09:26.348 --> 09:31.309
Today, my friends,
we discuss <i>A Christmas Carol.</i>

09:31.483 --> 09:35.662
Perhaps the most overrated
of Charles Dickens'’s books.

09:35.836 --> 09:40.362
And I must say, it certainly
missed my "great expectations."
[chuckles]

09:40.536 --> 09:42.233
Now, when I read the book,

09:42.407 --> 09:45.715
I felt like I was being visited
by the ghost of Christmas past.

09:45.889 --> 09:47.325
Hard pass for me.

09:49.893 --> 09:51.460
Liam.

09:51.634 --> 09:54.071
I'’d be curious why you find
the young lady'’s hair

09:54.245 --> 09:56.421
more captivating
than my lecture.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.337
No, I wasn'’t--
I wasn'’t staring
at Emma'’s shiny hair.

09:59.511 --> 10:00.774
Oh?[students chuckle]

10:01.905 --> 10:05.126
Then what part of her
were you staring at?

10:07.389 --> 10:08.608
- Arm.
- Arm.

10:08.782 --> 10:10.087
[students laugh]

10:10.261 --> 10:11.741
But I was also listening to you.

10:11.915 --> 10:15.005
Is that right?
So you'’re able to ogle her arm

10:15.179 --> 10:17.051
and listen to me
at the same time?

10:17.225 --> 10:18.530
Yeah, it'’s--
it'’s not that hard.

10:18.705 --> 10:19.880
[students laugh]

10:20.054 --> 10:22.970
Now, Liam,
if you'’re so hyperaware,

10:23.144 --> 10:26.147
maybe you can tell me
what book I am discussing.

10:30.020 --> 10:31.152
"Carol'’s Christmas"?

10:31.326 --> 10:33.284
[students laugh]

10:33.458 --> 10:34.851
Gotcha.

10:35.025 --> 10:36.679
Now pay attention.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.334
Demerit.

10:39.508 --> 10:40.944
[student]
"Carol'’s Christmas."

10:41.118 --> 10:43.512
Written by the great author,
Dickens Charles.

10:43.686 --> 10:46.036
[students laugh]

10:46.210 --> 10:49.257
Hey! You don'’t make fun of
dyslexia. Not cool.

10:51.085 --> 10:53.914
Oh, and by the way,
Einstein had dyslexia too.

10:54.088 --> 10:55.524
The bagel guy?

10:56.525 --> 10:58.005
No. No, the other one.

11:01.573 --> 11:03.401
[Liam] <i>You see the way
Emma stood up for me?</i>

11:03.575 --> 11:05.360
Maybe she likes me too.

11:07.623 --> 11:10.539
Liam, you'’re right
about Emma being awesome.

11:10.713 --> 11:14.804
But she'’s not gonna be
interested in you unless
you pull it together, man.

11:14.978 --> 11:16.458
Attempt to be cool.

11:16.632 --> 11:18.503
[sighs] Maybe you'’re right.

11:19.896 --> 11:22.377
All right, I gotta go.
I gotta mail a letter to Santa.

11:23.204 --> 11:24.901
What?
Letter to Santa?

11:25.075 --> 11:28.513
This is exactly
the kind of crap
I'’m talking about.

11:28.688 --> 11:31.125
What are you doing
writing letters to Santa?

11:31.299 --> 11:32.692
[sighs]

11:32.866 --> 11:36.130
Look, I know.
I know he'’s probably not real.

11:36.304 --> 11:38.393
But let'’s just say
there'’s, like,
a 1% chance he is

11:38.567 --> 11:40.221
and there'’s something
you really want.

11:40.395 --> 11:43.267
What possible harm
could there be
to write a stupid letter?

11:43.441 --> 11:45.139
Okay, I guess.

11:47.010 --> 11:51.798
And the big reason
I write it
is for my mom.

11:51.972 --> 11:54.017
What?
She wants stuff from Santa too?

11:54.191 --> 11:55.062
No.

11:56.672 --> 11:59.675
Nobody in this world
loves Christmas
more than my mom.

11:59.849 --> 12:01.242
Or did, anyway.

12:02.547 --> 12:05.812
I just think
me writing the letter
makes her happy.

12:07.291 --> 12:09.076
I like it better
when she'’s happy.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.121
Okay, okay, whatever.

12:11.295 --> 12:14.298
Just keep that letter thing
under wraps.

12:14.472 --> 12:18.868
If the kids at school
ever found out about this,
you'’d be destroyed.

12:19.042 --> 12:22.002
- Destroyed.
- You'’re not gonna
tell anyone, right?

12:22.176 --> 12:25.092
Good God, no.
How do you think
it would make me look

12:25.266 --> 12:27.181
that my bestie
still believes in Santa?

12:28.225 --> 12:29.400
I'’m your bestie?

12:31.141 --> 12:32.142
Yeah.

12:34.188 --> 12:35.145
Hey, Gibby...

12:36.973 --> 12:38.801
Remember I told you
we moved out here

12:38.975 --> 12:41.935
because I was supposed to be
in the witness protection
program?

12:42.718 --> 12:43.980
Yeah?

12:44.938 --> 12:47.288
Well, that wasn'’t true.

12:49.159 --> 12:52.380
Some bad stuff--

12:52.554 --> 12:54.599
bad stuff happened
back where we used to live.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.298
There was an accident,
and that was right before--

12:57.472 --> 12:59.691
Hey, hey. Have you ever had
the Impossible Burger lasagna?

12:59.866 --> 13:01.345
- What?
- Have you ever had it?

13:01.519 --> 13:03.391
I haven'’t,
but I hear it'’s really good.

13:03.565 --> 13:06.655
Come on, Gibby.
I was about to
tell you something huge.

13:06.829 --> 13:08.788
Yeah, that'’s why
I made small talk.

13:10.137 --> 13:12.269
I'’m really bad
with that serious crap.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.185
Yeah, me too.

13:16.491 --> 13:18.145
["Sleigh Ride" playing]

13:24.847 --> 13:27.110
Thanks for letting me
come with you
to mail your letter.

13:27.284 --> 13:28.546
It'’s more fun this way.

13:30.113 --> 13:32.550
Hey, I see the town'’s putting on
a big Christmas carnival
this week.

13:32.724 --> 13:34.552
Maybe you and I
can go to that.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.076
Uh...

13:36.250 --> 13:38.034
Yeah, Mom. Maybe.

13:39.427 --> 13:41.864
A lot of kids from my class
are gonna be there and...

13:42.038 --> 13:43.083
Oh.

13:43.257 --> 13:44.780
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

13:56.096 --> 13:58.272
Come on, baby.
Let'’s go. Come on.

14:01.275 --> 14:02.711
To Santa.

14:09.674 --> 14:13.678
Care of the North Pole.

14:47.451 --> 14:48.975
[footsteps approach]

14:49.714 --> 14:50.933
Huh.

14:51.107 --> 14:53.109
Well, you don'’t see this
very often.

14:56.156 --> 14:58.593
[mother] But why do you
always have to cut me off?[Bill scoffs]

14:58.767 --> 15:01.248
Are you kidding me?
You'’re always cutting me off.

15:01.422 --> 15:04.947
[mother] After everything
he'’s been through, I worry
about his mental well-being.

15:05.121 --> 15:08.559
[Bill]
Can we not turn this into
a therapy session?

15:08.733 --> 15:11.171
[mother]
Okay, if believing in Santa
makes him happy,

15:11.345 --> 15:13.129
what right do you have
to say that he can'’t?

15:13.303 --> 15:15.915
Oh, come on.
Don'’t make me the bad guy.

15:16.089 --> 15:18.352
[sighs]
I wish there was a Santa.

15:18.526 --> 15:20.789
Because then I'’d have a pony.

15:20.963 --> 15:23.618
'’Cause that'’s what I asked for
every year when I was a kid.

15:23.792 --> 15:26.664
[mother]
That'’s why you'’re mad?
You never got a pony.

15:27.622 --> 15:29.667
[Bill] Knock it off.

15:29.841 --> 15:32.235
You said
you were gonna talk to him.[mother] And I will.

15:32.409 --> 15:34.324
[Bill] When?[mother] I don'’t know. Soon.

15:35.108 --> 15:36.326
[cat meows]

15:44.030 --> 15:45.901
[thunder rumbles in distance]

15:51.646 --> 15:54.127
[hangars rattle][footsteps thud]

15:55.737 --> 15:58.870
[groans]
Blitzen, is that you?

16:01.090 --> 16:02.657
Use the litter box.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.096
[sniffs]

16:08.228 --> 16:09.925
[groans] That'’s putrid.

16:10.099 --> 16:11.535
Thank you.[Liam gasps]

16:12.841 --> 16:14.364
Who was that? [exclaims]

16:17.019 --> 16:17.889
[shouts]

16:20.066 --> 16:21.893
Who are you? What do you want?

16:23.983 --> 16:25.941
What do you mean what do I want?
It'’s me.

16:26.550 --> 16:27.464
[Liam] Who?

16:27.638 --> 16:29.162
Me. I got your letter.

16:29.901 --> 16:30.902
What letter?

16:31.077 --> 16:32.643
The letter you sent me.

16:32.817 --> 16:34.341
I never sent you a letter.

16:34.515 --> 16:36.473
What do you call this,
fudge nuts?

16:39.563 --> 16:42.436
You had a list in there
asking for all sorts of
stupid crap.

16:44.655 --> 16:47.354
So you mean you'’re S--

16:47.528 --> 16:49.269
In the naughty flesh.

16:49.443 --> 16:52.663
Hey, I really want to thank you
for writing me, Liam.

16:52.837 --> 16:54.535
What an unexpected treat.

16:54.709 --> 16:56.189
Unexpected?

16:56.363 --> 17:00.149
Very. Guess how many letters
I get from kids a year.

17:00.323 --> 17:01.672
I'’m not a guesser.

17:01.846 --> 17:02.891
Guess!

17:04.110 --> 17:05.459
Seventy-one million?

17:06.764 --> 17:09.202
Seventy-one million? Uh, no.

17:09.898 --> 17:10.812
How many?

17:10.986 --> 17:12.727
None. [laughs]

17:12.901 --> 17:14.120
What?

17:14.294 --> 17:15.686
Sure, I get a few manifestos
in the mail

17:15.860 --> 17:17.471
from some wonderfully deranged
grown-ups, but--

17:17.645 --> 17:18.907
What is going on here?

17:19.081 --> 17:21.649
This is insane.
You don'’t exist.

17:21.823 --> 17:25.783
Really? Do you usually write
letters to people
who don'’t exist?

17:27.046 --> 17:29.700
You'’re just--
You'’re not what I expected.

17:29.874 --> 17:31.659
What'’d you expect?

17:31.833 --> 17:35.228
Well, for one thing,
I thought you'’d be
a little jollier.

17:35.402 --> 17:38.013
Jollier?
Who the hell'’s jolly these days?

17:38.927 --> 17:39.841
Fair point.

17:40.015 --> 17:41.190
But your suit is different.

17:41.364 --> 17:42.931
And your beard
doesn'’t look the same.

17:43.714 --> 17:44.889
But I guess you are, um,

17:45.064 --> 17:46.500
chunky enough.

17:46.674 --> 17:49.764
[chuckles]
Wow, you went there.

17:49.938 --> 17:53.289
What, you don'’t put on
a few extra pounds
over the holidays?

17:53.463 --> 17:56.118
- I guess.
- Besides, who said I was chunky?

17:56.292 --> 17:57.946
That'’s how they make you look
in the movies.

17:58.120 --> 17:59.948
Yeah, figures.

18:00.122 --> 18:02.516
If you'’re not a perfect size two
in Hollywood, they demonize you.

18:02.690 --> 18:07.738
And in the movies,
the reindeer usually have
the antlers, not you.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.393
Reindeer?

18:10.567 --> 18:11.829
Kid, are you high?

18:12.003 --> 18:13.527
Let me see that letter again.

18:15.006 --> 18:16.051
Give it.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.014
Oh, boy.

18:23.189 --> 18:27.410
Um, you wouldn'’t happen to
have trouble spelling,
would you?

18:27.584 --> 18:28.846
Yes.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.022
Sometimes.

18:31.197 --> 18:32.894
Ooh.

18:33.068 --> 18:35.114
Wait, how do I know
you'’re actually Santa

18:35.288 --> 18:36.854
and you'’re not
just messing with me?

18:37.028 --> 18:38.247
Check this out.

18:40.989 --> 18:43.078
Ho, ho, frickin'’ ho.

18:44.645 --> 18:45.950
No way!

18:46.125 --> 18:47.300
Yeah way.

18:47.474 --> 18:48.910
Where'’s my milk and cookies?

18:50.259 --> 18:52.392
Usually I only do the outfit
on Christmas Day.

18:52.566 --> 18:54.089
Gotta keep a low profile.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.440
And I'’m back!

18:58.789 --> 19:00.051
I don'’t believe this!

19:00.226 --> 19:01.314
Right? Good stuff.

19:01.488 --> 19:03.359
Okay,
enough of the party tricks.

19:03.533 --> 19:05.622
Down to biz.
I'’m here to offer you a deal.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.842
A deal?

19:08.016 --> 19:11.454
Isn'’t the deal I'’m good,
I write you a letter,
you get me stuff?

19:11.628 --> 19:13.978
The letter thing'’s
a total myth.
Fake news.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.981
You, my friend,
are getting wishes.
Three wishes.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.548
Three wishes?

19:18.722 --> 19:20.289
What, you mean like a genie?

19:21.072 --> 19:22.683
They stole that from me.

19:22.857 --> 19:24.511
Wait,
so there really are genies?

19:24.685 --> 19:27.209
Sorry, I can'’t discuss it.
It'’s under "litigaysh."

19:27.818 --> 19:28.776
Okay, ready?

19:29.429 --> 19:30.517
Wish time.

19:32.083 --> 19:35.348
Are you telling me
I can wish for anything
in the whole wide world?

19:35.522 --> 19:37.828
Yeah. I mean, within reason.

19:38.002 --> 19:40.570
I can'’t undo the War of 1812.

19:40.744 --> 19:42.268
What'’s the War of 1812?

19:43.182 --> 19:45.662
It was a war. In 1812.

19:45.836 --> 19:47.751
Look, the point is
I can'’t change history.

19:47.925 --> 19:50.058
But anything you want
moving forward,
I can deliver.

19:50.232 --> 19:51.799
So, come on, make a wish.

19:51.973 --> 19:54.323
[exhales] Well, I mean,
there'’s a lot I could wish for

19:54.497 --> 19:56.804
and I wasn'’t expecting this,
so I'’m trying to think.

19:57.761 --> 20:00.242
World peace, climate change.

20:00.416 --> 20:03.114
Geez, childhood hunger is
a big problem right now.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.813
Are you kidding me with this?
You don'’t have a wish ready?

20:05.987 --> 20:08.816
I mean, you read my letter.
Shouldn'’t you already know
what I want?

20:08.990 --> 20:10.426
Okay, you got me.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.298
I didn'’t read the whole thing.
It was boring.

20:12.472 --> 20:14.561
Besides, what'’s with
all this Goody Two-shoes stuff?

20:14.735 --> 20:16.737
I can give you
anything you want.

20:16.911 --> 20:19.740
How about a dirt bike?
A yacht.

20:19.914 --> 20:21.307
I could get you a helicopter.

20:21.481 --> 20:23.222
What about your personal life?

20:23.396 --> 20:24.919
A girl? [snorts]

20:25.659 --> 20:26.834
Is there a girl you like?

20:27.443 --> 20:29.315
Yeah. Emma.

20:31.447 --> 20:33.275
I do kind of wish
she'’d give me a chance.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.190
Boom! Done!

20:35.364 --> 20:37.236
She'’s gonna give you a chance.
That'’s one wish, two to go.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.238
- See you tomorrow.
- Wait!

20:39.977 --> 20:40.848
That'’s it?

20:41.022 --> 20:42.458
That'’s it.

20:42.632 --> 20:44.373
How do I know my wish
is actually gonna come true?

20:45.331 --> 20:46.462
Really?

20:46.636 --> 20:48.247
The whirling around
and costume change

20:48.421 --> 20:49.509
didn'’t convince you?

20:49.683 --> 20:50.684
How about this?

20:51.772 --> 20:52.686
[shouts]

20:52.860 --> 20:54.340
I'’ve already seen that one.

20:54.514 --> 20:57.473
Okay. Have you seen this?

20:57.995 --> 20:59.258
[meows]

21:00.781 --> 21:01.912
[growls]

21:02.957 --> 21:04.001
Booyah!

21:05.699 --> 21:07.048
Huh?

21:08.049 --> 21:09.311
Santa'’s the shit!

21:11.792 --> 21:12.749
Sold.

21:12.923 --> 21:15.404
Yeah. [laughs]

21:17.188 --> 21:18.451
Catch you on the flip-flop.

21:26.285 --> 21:27.590
Mom, wake up.

21:27.764 --> 21:29.418
Mom. Wake up.

21:30.201 --> 21:32.334
Hey. Is everything okay?

21:32.508 --> 21:33.814
Yeah, yeah.
Everything'’s great.

21:33.988 --> 21:36.643
I have amazing news, Mom.
Santa came to my room.

21:36.817 --> 21:38.209
What?

21:38.384 --> 21:40.864
Santa. He got my letter,
and he came to my room.

21:41.038 --> 21:42.910
You were dreaming.
Just go back to bed, honey.

21:43.084 --> 21:44.607
No, Mom. I'’m wide awake.

21:44.781 --> 21:47.262
Here'’s the letter I sent him.
He gave it back to me.

21:47.436 --> 21:49.917
And he made Blitzen speak.
In English.

21:50.613 --> 21:52.311
Go back to sleep, honey.

21:52.485 --> 21:54.922
What, do you not believe me?
How would I have
the letter back?

21:56.532 --> 22:00.493
I don'’t know. I mean,
maybe you just forgot to
put it in the mailbox.

22:00.667 --> 22:01.929
No, I didn'’t--

22:03.060 --> 22:04.279
Where'’s Dad?

22:04.453 --> 22:07.151
Oh, he--
he'’s sleeping on the couch.

22:07.761 --> 22:08.631
Why?

22:08.805 --> 22:10.894
Uh, just because, you know,

22:11.068 --> 22:13.506
his back has been
hurting him lately.

22:13.680 --> 22:15.725
Should we wake him up
and tell him the good news?

22:15.899 --> 22:20.861
No, no. Your father
has work tomorrow,
so we should just let him rest.

22:23.167 --> 22:24.255
Isn'’t it great though?

22:24.430 --> 22:26.170
Santa Claus is real!

22:27.171 --> 22:28.651
Good night, Mom. Love you.

22:29.435 --> 22:30.436
Love you too.

22:33.090 --> 22:34.309
Huh.

22:46.582 --> 22:48.410
What the hell did you expect?

22:48.584 --> 22:50.978
You said you'’d talk to him,
and then you keep
putting it off.

22:51.152 --> 22:53.154
It'’s not an easy thing
to just say to a kid.

22:53.981 --> 22:55.939
Actually, he'’s not a kid.

22:56.113 --> 22:58.681
And look what happened now.
He'’s having dreams
he thinks are real.

22:58.855 --> 23:01.423
Oh. Really gonna
lay that one on me too?

23:16.612 --> 23:18.048
Thanks.

23:18.222 --> 23:20.181
Hey, Dad. Did Mom tell you
what happened last night?

23:20.355 --> 23:21.965
She, uh, mentioned it.

23:22.836 --> 23:24.185
Isn'’t it incredible?

23:25.491 --> 23:28.319
Santa Claus,
right here in our house.

23:28.494 --> 23:30.321
He is a little different
than you think though.

23:30.496 --> 23:32.106
[Bill stammers] Yeah.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.978
Must'’ve been some dream,
huh, kiddo?

23:35.152 --> 23:39.983
What? It wasn'’t a dream.
I mean, it was as real
as real can be.

23:40.984 --> 23:43.160
All right. See you guys later.

23:43.334 --> 23:46.207

No, no, I was being serious.

That won'’t be a problem.

what happened last night.

I'’m pretty sure you going to
Post Malone with Emma
is the craziest part.

27:47.927 --> 27:50.625
You'’d think so,
but Santa came to my room
last night!

Santa came to your room?

27:52.714 --> 27:54.107
I swear.

27:54.281 --> 27:56.457
But he didn'’t look like Santa.
He had antlers.

27:56.631 --> 27:59.678
But then he looked like Santa,
but he explained
he didn'’t walk around like that,

27:59.852 --> 28:01.288
except on Christmas.

28:01.462 --> 28:03.159
That had to be your imagination.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.248
If it was my imagination,

28:05.422 --> 28:07.207
then how do you explain him
being in the cage
with my hamster

28:07.381 --> 28:08.948
during science class?

28:09.122 --> 28:12.473
Santa Claus was in the cage
- with your hamster?
- Uh-huh.

28:12.647 --> 28:16.129
You must'’ve been having
some weird dreams last night.

28:16.303 --> 28:18.131
But the hamster thing
happened today.

28:18.305 --> 28:19.654
[Gibby] Whatever.

28:19.828 --> 28:22.657
Night dreams, daydreams,
they can seem real.

28:24.267 --> 28:25.486
Look! There he is.

28:26.530 --> 28:27.531
Where?

28:28.184 --> 28:29.882
On the bench.

The only guy on the bench.

28:34.843 --> 28:36.453
That'’s Santa?

Yeah. Yeah, he'’s the one
who brought me my letter back.

28:39.543 --> 28:40.631
Wanna meet him?

28:40.806 --> 28:42.285
Uh, that'’s gonna be a hard pass.

Look who you addressed that to.

Take your time.

Well, at least it somehow
still got to Santa.

28:58.127 --> 28:59.128
Did it?

29:00.129 --> 29:02.131
Are you saying... No.

29:02.305 --> 29:04.090

There is no devil.

Get over here!

29:23.370 --> 29:25.024
What'’s with
the tiny, slow steps?

29:25.198 --> 29:27.156
Let'’s pick up the pace. Come on.

29:28.592 --> 29:29.637
What'’s your deal, kid?

29:29.811 --> 29:30.943
First, you send me a letter,

29:31.117 --> 29:32.814
and then I make
your dreams come true,

29:32.988 --> 29:34.990
and then you avoid me like
I'’m the frickin'’ Easter Bunny?

29:35.164 --> 29:38.385
Sorry, I didn'’t see you
over there on the bench
where you were sitting.

29:38.559 --> 29:40.256
Um, can I ask you
a question?

29:40.430 --> 29:42.693
Does Pinocchio poop pinecones?

29:43.520 --> 29:45.653
My God! You are Satan.

29:45.827 --> 29:47.437
No, I'’m not.

29:47.611 --> 29:49.352
Come on, turd breath,
we'’ve already been through this.

29:49.526 --> 29:51.485
I'’m your friend, Santy Claus.

29:51.659 --> 29:53.574
Turd breath? [sniffs]

29:53.748 --> 29:55.097
Does my breath stink?

29:55.271 --> 29:57.926
No, I was just saying that
to make you feel bad.

29:58.100 --> 30:01.451
[chuckles] Okay, okay.
I'’m Satan. You got me.

30:01.625 --> 30:03.366
Now quit being a baby.

30:03.540 --> 30:06.326
You lucked out big time,
dumbass.
I'’m way better than Santa.

30:06.500 --> 30:08.371
- How?
- Come on, think about it.

30:08.545 --> 30:10.460
What do you want
under the Christmas tree?

30:10.634 --> 30:12.941
A pair of itchy socks
that Grandma knitted you?

30:13.115 --> 30:16.031
Or anything in the world
your little selfish heart
desires?

30:17.293 --> 30:19.121
- Oh, look, it'’s a dove.
- Is it?

30:22.255 --> 30:24.779
Oh, God. Oh, God.
I can'’t move.

30:28.217 --> 30:30.002
If you touch me,
I'’ll scream.

30:30.176 --> 30:32.874
Why would I touch you?
I'’m the devil,
not a trusted relative.

30:33.048 --> 30:36.356
[laughs] Sorry.
That was low-hanging fruit.

30:36.530 --> 30:39.838
By the way, we got a lot of
those creepy uncle types
down where I'’m from.

30:40.926 --> 30:41.927
[grunts]

30:42.405 --> 30:43.929
All right?

30:44.103 --> 30:46.627
Come on.
Now, just relax, kid.

30:46.801 --> 30:49.760
You and I
are gonna do a lot better
if we work together.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.545
I'’m not comfortable with this.

30:51.719 --> 30:56.028
I don'’t wanna be seen talking to
some weird guy with horns.

30:56.202 --> 30:58.595
Okay, is it the horns
that bother you?
Watch this.

31:01.772 --> 31:02.904
All gone.

31:05.037 --> 31:08.649
Sir, since I was clearly writing
to Santa and not to you,

31:08.823 --> 31:12.566
maybe we can just forget
about all this
and you can go on your way.

31:12.740 --> 31:15.351
Not that easy, buddy boy.
You already made
your first wish,

31:15.525 --> 31:17.876
and that means
we have a deal in progress.

31:18.050 --> 31:21.575
There'’s no getting out of
this thing until
all three wishes are used up.

31:21.749 --> 31:24.143
By the way, check your phone.

31:29.583 --> 31:31.150
Oh, my God!

31:34.501 --> 31:36.329
That'’s it? OMG?

31:36.503 --> 31:37.721
Where'’s my thank-you?

31:37.896 --> 31:39.158
You can'’t get better tickets
than that.

31:39.332 --> 31:41.508
That'’s where Mama Posty sits.

31:41.682 --> 31:46.513
But I didn'’t ask for tickets.
I wished for Emma to like me.

31:46.687 --> 31:49.864
Nope. Technically,
you wished for her to
give you a chance.

31:50.038 --> 31:52.040
- What'’s the difference?
- Big difference.

31:52.214 --> 31:54.608
She'’s gonna give you a chance.
That'’s all.
You can still screw it up.

31:54.782 --> 31:57.567
But to give your chance
a chance, I threw in
those tickets as a freebie,

31:57.741 --> 32:00.919
'’cause let'’s face it,
your game'’s a little weak.

32:02.007 --> 32:05.662
Sir,
I'’m going to politely decline.

32:05.836 --> 32:08.578
You can have those tickets back.
Scalp '’em if you want.

32:09.623 --> 32:11.407
I wanna call off our deal
entirely.

32:11.581 --> 32:14.976
I told you, you can'’t.
You summoned me.

32:15.150 --> 32:16.673
No, I summoned Santa.

32:16.847 --> 32:19.415
Nope.
Pretty sure you wrote "Satan."

32:19.589 --> 32:20.721
S-A-T-A-N.

32:20.895 --> 32:22.418
It was a mistake.

32:22.592 --> 32:23.724
There are no mistakes.

32:23.898 --> 32:25.987
Everything happens for a reason.

32:26.161 --> 32:27.467
Just ask your God.

32:27.641 --> 32:29.338
This didn'’t happen for a reason.

32:29.512 --> 32:31.210
It was a total typo.

32:31.384 --> 32:32.515
I have learning differences.

32:32.689 --> 32:33.777
[mock crying]

32:33.952 --> 32:35.475
Everyone'’s a victim these days.

32:35.649 --> 32:39.522
OCD, ADD, L-M-N-O-P.
Blah, blah, blah.

32:39.696 --> 32:41.698
When I was a kid,
they'’d slap you
in the back of the head

32:41.872 --> 32:43.048
and tell you to suck it up.

32:43.657 --> 32:44.614
You were a kid?

32:45.398 --> 32:46.834
I don'’t wanna talk about it.

32:48.879 --> 32:50.969
Liam, you'’re looking
at this thing all wrong.

32:51.143 --> 32:54.276
The way I see it,
there'’s some good news
and some other news.

32:54.450 --> 32:56.800
The good news is
you'’ve got two more wishes.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.019
That'’s pretty amazing.

32:58.193 --> 32:59.194
And the other news?

32:59.368 --> 33:00.630
Huh?

33:00.804 --> 33:03.024
You said
- there was other news.
- Oh, right.

33:03.198 --> 33:05.809
After you make two more wishes,
I'’m taking your soul.

33:06.549 --> 33:07.811
What? Are you insane?

33:07.986 --> 33:10.510
I prefer "sanity adjacent."

33:10.684 --> 33:13.165
Well, what if I don'’t make
the other two wishes?

33:13.339 --> 33:15.210
- You will.
- What if I don'’t?

33:15.384 --> 33:18.170
- Uh, trust me, you will.
- And if I don'’t?

33:18.344 --> 33:20.520
[sighs]
If you do not make three wishes,

33:20.694 --> 33:22.478
technically,
I cannot take your soul.

33:22.652 --> 33:23.914
But you will.

33:24.089 --> 33:26.439
Here.
See that cloud over there?

33:26.613 --> 33:29.311
Let me show you
a few of the things
I could do for you.

33:40.757 --> 33:42.020

34:06.479 --> 34:07.828
All right. Let'’s go, kid.

You see that, kid?

34:20.362 --> 34:22.886
You ain'’t never had
a friend like me.

34:23.061 --> 34:24.975
Okay, that I may have stolen
from <i>Aladdin.</i>

34:25.150 --> 34:26.934
Now we'’re even. [chuckles]

34:28.022 --> 34:30.416
Liam, you got the world
by the oysters.

34:30.590 --> 34:33.114
I don'’t really like oysters.

34:33.288 --> 34:35.638
I think I'’m going to
politely pass on your offer.

34:37.031 --> 34:38.119
What'’s the matter with you?

34:38.293 --> 34:39.642
I don'’t know.

34:39.816 --> 34:42.210
I mean,
these are all nice ideas.
I just...

34:42.384 --> 34:44.082
I kinda don'’t wanna
give up my soul.

Liam, do you know this man?

34:54.918 --> 34:56.311
Yeah, I'’m his uncle. Beat it.

34:56.485 --> 34:57.921
Uh...

34:58.096 --> 34:59.358
Is this true, Liam?

35:00.185 --> 35:01.534
Yes. Yes, it is.

35:02.317 --> 35:04.798
Huh. Well, then.

35:04.972 --> 35:09.324
Maybe you can suggest to
your nephew to stop being
so inattentive in class.

35:09.498 --> 35:10.847
It'’s causing disruptions.

35:12.588 --> 35:15.243
How'’s that again?
I wasn'’t really paying attention
to anything you just said.

35:15.417 --> 35:18.507
I was saying young Liam here
has a bad habit of being in--

35:18.681 --> 35:20.161

35:20.335 --> 35:22.294
Very funny, wise guy.

35:22.468 --> 35:25.166
Can you really blame him though?
You'’re pretty damn boring,
you know.

35:25.340 --> 35:27.473
Excuse me.

35:27.647 --> 35:30.258
Who do you think you are,
talking to me like that?

Now, I will not tolerate
obscene language directed at me.

35:43.619 --> 35:44.533
Oh, my.

35:45.317 --> 35:46.231
Dear me.

35:46.405 --> 35:48.450
That doesn'’t sound right.

35:48.624 --> 35:50.844
I hope you'’re not getting
that stomach bug
that'’s been going around.

35:51.018 --> 35:52.411
Sir, I am the picture of health.

Pardon me. Kombucha.

Sometimes that can be unruly.

Ooh.

36:12.039 --> 36:15.651

36:27.097 --> 36:29.056

Did you know every time
a grown man sharts himself,

36:31.711 --> 36:33.278
a demon earns its horns?

36:34.322 --> 36:35.367
It'’s true.

36:35.541 --> 36:37.934
[farts, bubbles]
Oh! No! Tummy tum.

36:39.632 --> 36:41.721
Never trust a fart.
You just gambled and lost.

[stomach growls,
chuckles, exclaims]

36:43.810 --> 36:46.029
I apologize.
But it appears... [farts]
Oh, no.

37:08.269 --> 37:09.575
Nice to meet ya!

[Satan laughs]

37:18.453 --> 37:20.325
Let'’s look at the bright side.

37:20.499 --> 37:23.023
The first two wishes
are freebies, right?

37:23.197 --> 37:25.243
He only gets your soul
after the third?

37:25.417 --> 37:26.853
Yeah, but--

37:27.027 --> 37:29.595
And you can tap out
at any time before then. Right?

37:29.769 --> 37:33.642
Well, yeah, technically. But I--Well, then what'’s the problem?

37:33.816 --> 37:36.993
Look, I'’m worried Satan
is going to trick me
into making more wishes.

37:37.167 --> 37:38.517
He'’s pretty clever.

37:38.691 --> 37:40.693
He pretty much tricked me
into the first one.

37:40.867 --> 37:42.782
Yeah,
that'’s classic Satan stuff.

37:42.956 --> 37:44.784
But I think you'’ll be fine.

37:45.741 --> 37:47.613
Like, you'’re strong.

37:47.787 --> 37:50.180
You'’re not gonna make
any more wishes
if you don'’t want to.

37:51.965 --> 37:55.490
That'’s what I thought.
But Satan said
I definitely would.

37:55.664 --> 37:58.188
Don'’t worry about
what Satan said.

37:58.363 --> 37:59.973
You'’re the nicest kid I know.

38:00.626 --> 38:01.844
Thanks, Gibby.

38:02.454 --> 38:03.716
[groans] All right.

38:04.934 --> 38:06.371
I gotta go convince my parents

38:06.545 --> 38:08.286
into letting me go to
this concert.

38:09.374 --> 38:11.201
That'’s gonna be a tough one.

38:11.376 --> 38:13.029
[sighs]
Yeah. Wish me luck.

38:27.348 --> 38:29.524
Hey, Mom and Dad.
I wanted to ask if I could--

38:30.569 --> 38:31.700
Hi, honey.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.834
- Hi.
- Hello, Liam.

38:35.008 --> 38:36.618
I'’m Dr. Finkleman.

38:36.792 --> 38:38.098
Hello.

38:38.272 --> 38:40.927
Dr. Finkleman is
a child psychologist, Liam.

38:41.101 --> 38:42.494
Hmm.

38:42.668 --> 38:44.322
I hear
that'’s an interesting field.

38:44.496 --> 38:45.497
Hmm.

38:47.063 --> 38:49.022
I'’m gonna go watch

38:50.502 --> 38:51.851
Uh, Liam.

38:52.982 --> 38:54.070
Hmm?

38:54.244 --> 38:56.638
Dr. Finkleman
is here to see you.

38:56.812 --> 38:58.597
Oh, God.

38:58.771 --> 39:01.295
[Finkleman]
<i>So, I wanna make sure
I have this straight.</i>

39:01.469 --> 39:06.126
Uh, first, you thought
Santa came into your bedroom.

39:06.300 --> 39:10.348
But now you think
it wasn'’t Santa,
it was Satan.

39:10.522 --> 39:13.089
- Yeah, that'’s right.
- No.

39:13.873 --> 39:14.787
He must be confused.

39:14.961 --> 39:16.745
He means Saint Nick, not Satan.

39:17.529 --> 39:19.705
No, no, that'’s what I thought.

39:19.879 --> 39:22.185
But then I realized
it was Satan.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.361
Oh, no.

39:24.231 --> 39:25.624
No, no, no, no, no.

39:26.538 --> 39:27.974
No. Think he'’s just confused.

39:28.148 --> 39:31.804
Well, um,
let'’s say he is confused.

39:31.978 --> 39:36.548
Liam, you confused
Santa and Satan. How?

39:36.722 --> 39:41.161
Well, they both have
surprisingly similar styles.

39:41.335 --> 39:46.296
I mean, you know, beards,
a generous build,

39:46.471 --> 39:49.952
and their clothing is reddish
with black boots.

39:50.126 --> 39:51.911
[phone buzzes]

39:52.085 --> 39:54.217
[whispers]
- Where is this coming from?
- I don'’t know.

39:54.392 --> 39:56.219
[mother]
Did you know? What is this?

39:56.394 --> 39:58.308
[Bill] It'’s fully thought out.[mother]
Where is this coming from?

39:58.483 --> 39:59.962
[Bill] It'’s fully realized.[mother] Yeah, it is.

40:00.136 --> 40:01.355
["Congratulations" playing
on phone]

40:01.529 --> 40:02.835
Hey, it'’s not
phone time right now.

40:03.009 --> 40:05.228
Come on, honey. Put it away.

40:05.403 --> 40:09.972
Do you have any idea why Satan
would come visit you
in your room?

40:10.146 --> 40:11.496
Well, because I wrote him
a letter.

40:11.670 --> 40:15.369
And again,
why were you writing to Satan?

40:15.543 --> 40:17.023
No, I wasn'’t.

40:17.197 --> 40:18.981
I meant to write it to Santa,

40:19.155 --> 40:21.723
but I mixed up the letters
and it went to Satan.

40:21.897 --> 40:23.159
Didn'’t you jot that one down?

40:23.333 --> 40:26.032
- Hey. Liam. Calm down.
- I'’m sorry.

40:26.206 --> 40:29.209
It'’s been a tough year,
with the tragedy and all.

40:29.383 --> 40:33.779
I know it might sound crazy,
but the devil came to
my bedroom.

40:33.953 --> 40:35.389
With God as my witness.

40:35.563 --> 40:40.089
So, is God witnessing you now
as well, Liam?

40:40.263 --> 40:42.570
No. That was an expression.

40:42.744 --> 40:45.660
Mom, I really need to
talk to you about--Not right now, Liam.

40:45.834 --> 40:47.619
We need to finish talking
with Dr. Finkleman, okay?

40:47.793 --> 40:49.359
And make sure you tell him
the truth.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.666
I am telling him the truth!
I already told you that.

40:51.840 --> 40:53.842
[coughing][mother] He'’s here to help us.

40:58.978 --> 41:02.024
[strained]
No, it'’s okay.
I got something stuck.

41:03.678 --> 41:05.419
Dr. Finkleman,
can I get you a water?

41:07.203 --> 41:08.378
I'’m gonna get it.

Okay, then if that'’s the truth,
thank you for being honest
with us.

41:32.577 --> 41:33.665
[Liam]

It is so nice to
- finally meet you.
- Oh.

42:09.831 --> 42:11.920
Nice to meet you too,
Mrs. Turner.

42:12.094 --> 42:15.054
Um, how--
how is everything going?
Are you feeling okay?

42:15.228 --> 42:18.884
You know, some good days,
some bad days. Mostly bad.

42:19.058 --> 42:21.582
Oh, well, come on in the house.
Let me get you something
to drink.

42:21.756 --> 42:24.063
Oh, no, thank you,
Mrs. Turner.
I don'’t have time.

42:24.237 --> 42:26.021
I'’m just here to pick up Liam

42:26.195 --> 42:29.242
because he promised me to
go to my chemo session with me
tonight.

42:30.069 --> 42:31.287
- Yeah.
- Oh.

42:31.461 --> 42:32.724
Mom, I was trying
to tell you about that.

42:32.898 --> 42:34.160
Um...

42:34.334 --> 42:36.249
But I can go, right?
I mean, Gibby needs me.

42:36.423 --> 42:39.078
Oh, well,
I'’m not sure if you--

42:39.252 --> 42:40.949
- Bill?
- I mean-- I--

42:45.519 --> 42:49.218
Of course. Yes. Go, Liam.
Go... Go support your friend.

- Do you guys need a ride?
- No need.

Great to meet.

I'’ll be taking
these two eager beavers
over to the clinic,

43:01.709 --> 43:04.494
and then, if it'’s okay with you,
I'’d like to take them out
for a little boba.

43:04.669 --> 43:07.106

How'’s that sound? Little boba?

43:22.556 --> 43:27.561
Anyway, we really appreciate
Liam being such a big support
to Gibby.

43:27.735 --> 43:29.694
Time with good friends
is so important.

43:29.868 --> 43:31.043
Especially when
you don'’t know...

43:31.217 --> 43:33.001

...how much time you got left.

43:33.175 --> 43:34.350
- Yeah.
- But, uh...

43:34.524 --> 43:36.396
[snorts]
...great kid.

43:36.570 --> 43:38.790
You did something right.
Come on, guys. Let'’s go.

43:39.747 --> 43:42.228
- Yeah!
- Okay, uh, bye.

43:43.272 --> 43:44.273
See you later.

43:45.797 --> 43:49.061
Okay. Have fun at chemo.

43:51.454 --> 43:53.631
[Liam]
Did you just lie
about chemotherapy?

43:55.415 --> 43:56.851
Do you know how wrong that is?

43:57.025 --> 43:59.158
I do,
and I'’m not proud of it.

43:59.332 --> 44:01.073
I guess the devil made me do it.

44:01.247 --> 44:03.423
What the hell is going on?

[car door opens]
It wasn'’t my idea.

44:05.294 --> 44:06.948
He came to my house and told me

44:07.122 --> 44:09.168
that you wanted me
to go to the concert too.[horn honking]

44:09.342 --> 44:12.867
Come on, you chupacabras!
Hurry up. We'’re gonna be
late for the concert.

44:22.007 --> 44:23.922
[chattering, cheering]

44:27.839 --> 44:29.754
[Gibby] This is so cool.

44:29.928 --> 44:32.191
I'’ve never been
backstage before.

44:32.365 --> 44:34.236
Now, listen up,
mouse knuckle.

44:34.410 --> 44:37.022
If you want this girl to
find you interesting enough to
fall for you,

44:37.196 --> 44:39.677
you'’re gonna have to...
[snorts] ...you know.

44:39.851 --> 44:41.504
What? Be myself?

44:41.679 --> 44:43.898
No! Do not do that.

44:44.072 --> 44:45.291
You'’re gonna have to trick her.

44:45.465 --> 44:47.510
Trick her?
I don'’t wanna trick her.

44:47.685 --> 44:50.949
I just wanna make sure
she gets to see the real me.

44:51.123 --> 44:52.428
[laughs]

44:52.602 --> 44:54.822
And what'’s the real you, Liam?

44:54.996 --> 44:58.696
A good and kind
and, I think,
a sensitive person.

44:58.870 --> 45:00.088
Hold up.

45:00.262 --> 45:01.786
Can I give you
some free advice?

45:01.960 --> 45:04.223
You wanna get ahead
in the world,

45:04.397 --> 45:06.268
you gotta think about
yourself first.

45:06.442 --> 45:08.662
Numero uno.
It'’s a time-tested formula.

45:08.836 --> 45:10.969
Just look at your politicians.

45:11.143 --> 45:13.145
Okay.
You know how when
you'’re on a plane,

45:13.319 --> 45:16.017
they say, "Put on
your oxygen mask first
before helping others"?

45:16.714 --> 45:18.846
- Yeah?
- Like that.

45:19.020 --> 45:22.371
Except maybe you don'’t even
have to help anyone else
with their mask, right?

45:22.545 --> 45:25.026
Who wants to share oxygen
when a plane'’s going down, anyway?

45:25.200 --> 45:26.854
[laughs] Up top.

45:30.292 --> 45:32.207
We need to work on that.

45:32.381 --> 45:35.341
You two pieces of
belly button lint wait here.
I'’ll be right back.

45:37.604 --> 45:38.648
What'’s up?

45:39.562 --> 45:41.086
[whooshes]

45:44.698 --> 45:46.134
Whoa!

45:46.961 --> 45:48.223
It'’s Post Malone!

45:48.746 --> 45:50.443
Shut up.

45:50.617 --> 45:51.879

45:52.053 --> 45:53.011

45:54.490 --> 45:55.796
How are you, man?

You know Liam?

45:57.276 --> 45:58.364
Hell yeah, I know Liam.

45:58.538 --> 46:00.409
Liam is my inspiration.

46:00.583 --> 46:02.760
Liam is--
is my motivation, dude.

46:02.934 --> 46:06.111
You'’re what drives me, man.
Thank you so much
for what you do.

46:06.285 --> 46:09.636
Hey, hey, hey. What'’s up?
I see you'’ve already caught up
with Posty.

46:09.810 --> 46:12.030
What'’s up, bro?
- Great to see you.
- What'’s up, dude? Yes, sir.

46:12.204 --> 46:16.208
Look, I have to go,
but I wanted you to know.

46:16.382 --> 46:18.993
I am going to
kick this show'’s ass,

46:19.167 --> 46:21.648

to you tonight, man.

46:21.822 --> 46:24.129
I gotta go, dude,
but I love you so much, man.

46:24.303 --> 46:27.436
You'’re a living legend.
You'’re an absolute stud.

46:27.610 --> 46:29.787
You'’re the biggest beast
on planet Earth, Liam.

46:29.961 --> 46:31.658
You'’re the biggest rock star
in the universe.

46:31.832 --> 46:34.226
I love you so much,
and I'’ll see you
after the show, man.

46:34.400 --> 46:35.836
- Let'’s go!
- What'’s going on here?

46:36.010 --> 46:38.404
[sighs] Once again,
and hopefully for the last time,

46:38.578 --> 46:39.971
I can do cool shit.

46:40.145 --> 46:42.016
But how'’d you get him to
know who I am?

46:42.190 --> 46:44.976
I put him under
a simple, little spell.

46:45.150 --> 46:47.282
Don'’t worry,
- it'’s only temporary.
- But--

46:47.456 --> 46:50.546
Don'’t ask how
the sausage gets made, okay?

46:50.720 --> 46:53.027
Here you go, Gibby.
You'’re in the nosebleeds.

46:54.812 --> 46:57.510
Nosebleeds?
But I wanna sit with Liam.

46:57.684 --> 47:00.469
Look, even Satan can'’t
outtrick Ticketmaster.
I'’m not a bot.

47:03.908 --> 47:07.085
It'’s Emma.
She'’s at the seats.
I gotta go.

Get going, Liam.["Congratulations" playing

I think someone'’s at the door.

53:49.835 --> 53:51.837
<i>Must'’ve been Blitzen.
Where were we?</i>

53:52.011 --> 53:55.536
You were saying tomorrow night,
it all goes down.
What goes down?

53:55.710 --> 53:58.887
<i>I'’m gonna kiss Emma for real.
On the lips.</i>

53:59.061 --> 54:00.976
<i>Then there will be no question,
buddy boy.</i>

54:01.150 --> 54:02.804
Yeah, that'’s great.

54:02.978 --> 54:05.590
Gib. I finally got
the girl of my dreams.

54:05.764 --> 54:06.982
Why aren'’t you happy for me?

54:07.156 --> 54:08.810
<i>I'’m happy for you.</i>

54:08.984 --> 54:10.247
<i>Come on, Gibby.
What'’s wrong?</i>

54:10.421 --> 54:12.901
This is what'’s wrong. This.

54:14.468 --> 54:16.557
[sighs]
Look, you get to be the star,

54:16.731 --> 54:18.777
<i>and I can'’t even get a girl to
talk to me.</i>

54:18.951 --> 54:21.388
[sighs] <i>You know what, man?</i>

54:21.562 --> 54:23.695
<i>I'’m just gonna hang up.
I'’ll see you.</i>[call ends]

54:23.869 --> 54:25.174
Oh, wait, Gib!

54:25.784 --> 54:26.785
[sighs]

54:28.265 --> 54:29.266
[bird chitters,
wings flapping]

54:29.440 --> 54:30.789
[thuds][Satan grunts, exclaims]

54:30.963 --> 54:31.877
[squawks]

54:33.270 --> 54:35.924
[Satan]
Oh, it'’s freezing.
It'’s colder than a witch'’s tit.

54:36.098 --> 54:38.144
Why can'’t you leave
the damn window open?

54:38.318 --> 54:40.015
It gets chilly out here.

54:40.189 --> 54:42.844
Come on. Open the window!

54:43.018 --> 54:45.325
[squawks]
I'’m used to heat, man.

54:47.501 --> 54:49.286
[squawking]

54:51.723 --> 54:53.420
[snorts, groans]

54:54.465 --> 54:56.815
Did you have to
turn into a vulture?

54:56.989 --> 55:00.427
What, too on the nose?
I was wondering about that.
I should'’ve gone for a bat.

55:00.601 --> 55:03.909
[gasps]
How much fun was that tonight?

55:04.083 --> 55:05.563
[chuckles]

55:05.737 --> 55:06.912
It was very fun.

55:07.086 --> 55:08.217
[sighs] I'’d almost forgotten

55:08.392 --> 55:10.132
how much fun it was to dance
like that.

55:10.307 --> 55:12.004
Just dance like
no one was watching you.

55:12.178 --> 55:14.746
Except the whole auditorium was,
and that made it even better.

55:14.920 --> 55:16.791
[inhales] Booyah!

55:16.965 --> 55:18.445
Hey.

55:18.619 --> 55:20.317
Did your gal Emma
have a nice time?

55:20.491 --> 55:22.275
Yes.

55:22.449 --> 55:25.147
A very good time.
I wanna thank you for that.

55:25.322 --> 55:29.630
Ew! Look, kid,
do not be polite with me, okay?

55:29.804 --> 55:33.068
I'’m not a fan of that crap.
It'’s like nails on a chalkboard.

55:33.242 --> 55:35.462
Oh. I apologize for that, sir.

55:35.636 --> 55:37.856
Ugh! There you go again!

55:38.030 --> 55:40.467
You know,
you'’re starting to annoy me.

55:40.641 --> 55:43.514
I come all the way up here
to offer you any three wishes
you want,

55:43.688 --> 55:45.516
and what does
Mr. Goody Goody say?

55:45.690 --> 55:47.256
"Nah, I'’ll just take one."

55:48.040 --> 55:49.607
You'’re making me look bad.

55:49.781 --> 55:53.350
Actually, I wanted to ask you
a question about your offer.

55:55.482 --> 55:56.788
Do go on.

55:57.832 --> 55:59.225
So, you said

55:59.399 --> 56:02.533
you'’d only own my soul
if I made three wishes.

56:02.707 --> 56:04.796
- Is that true?
- I swear to God.

56:05.536 --> 56:06.537
So, that m--

56:08.060 --> 56:09.104
You swear to God?

56:09.278 --> 56:10.584
It'’s a figure of speech.

56:10.758 --> 56:12.847
I also say "go to hell"
when I'’m pissed,

56:13.021 --> 56:15.763
even though that'’d be like
other people saying,
"Let'’s go to Bermuda."

56:15.937 --> 56:19.158
Okay, good.
I'’d like to make my second wish.

56:19.332 --> 56:23.467
[laughs]
Finally! Here we go.
I was getting worried about you.

56:23.641 --> 56:24.642
So...

56:26.121 --> 56:27.558
what'’ll it be?

56:38.482 --> 56:39.483
Hi, Liam.

56:41.049 --> 56:43.965
Uh, hi? I guess.

56:45.532 --> 56:47.186
Good morning, buddy boy.

56:47.360 --> 56:49.144
Somebody'’s
in a good mood today.

56:49.318 --> 56:53.410
Why wouldn'’t I be?
It'’s a super-duper day to
be alive.

56:53.584 --> 56:57.109
Dude, you look awesome!
What happened?

56:57.283 --> 57:01.287
I woke up this morning,
and my teeth were just fixed.

57:01.461 --> 57:04.943
My mom always told me
I'’d grow into them,
and I guess she was right.

57:05.117 --> 57:08.468
My parents are happy.
They were about to take me
to go get braces.

57:08.642 --> 57:09.861
Perfect timing.

57:10.035 --> 57:11.384
What? Why?

57:11.558 --> 57:13.212
Me and Emma are going
to the carnival tonight.

57:13.386 --> 57:14.953
Maybe you wanna double-date?

57:15.127 --> 57:17.521
You don'’t think
she'’d feel like a third wheel?

57:17.695 --> 57:22.177
No, I mean "double date"
as in you bring a girl.

57:22.351 --> 57:26.617
I guess I could ask
my cousin Arielle,
but she'’s kinda picky.

57:26.791 --> 57:28.619
No, not someone
you'’re related to.

57:28.793 --> 57:30.098
A real girl.

57:30.272 --> 57:31.839
I mean, you are a stud.

57:32.013 --> 57:34.189
S-U-T-D. A stud.

57:34.363 --> 57:37.323
Actually, maybe you'’re right.

57:37.497 --> 57:40.108
Me being this handsome
might magically attract girls,

57:40.282 --> 57:42.850
so, you know,
why bring sand to the beach?

57:43.024 --> 57:45.157
Tonight,
I could be a free agent.

57:45.897 --> 57:46.811
Now you'’re talkin'’.

57:46.985 --> 57:47.942
See you.

57:48.116 --> 57:50.292
["Christmas in Hollis" playing]

57:50.467 --> 57:51.468
Hey, Gibby.

57:58.431 --> 57:59.476
[gasps]

58:04.219 --> 58:06.047
This is dope.

58:06.874 --> 58:07.875
Very.

58:09.094 --> 58:11.444
[laughing, chattering]

58:17.798 --> 58:19.452
Hey, look. That'’s Liam.

58:19.626 --> 58:21.410
That is him. Isn'’t it?

58:21.585 --> 58:23.500
This is sick, buddy.

58:23.674 --> 58:26.111
Somehow or another,
we became the cool kids.

58:26.285 --> 58:27.765
Who would'’ve thunk it?
[chuckles]

58:27.939 --> 58:29.462
Hey, where'’s Emma?

58:29.636 --> 58:31.333
Uh, she should be here
any minute.

58:36.382 --> 58:39.037
Do you really think
this is necessary?

58:39.211 --> 58:42.823
Molly, I don'’t know about you,
but-- but I-I-I'’m terrified.

58:42.997 --> 58:45.043
He'’s been talking nonstop
about Satan.[sighs]

58:45.217 --> 58:46.827
But are we sure
that we heard him say "Satan"

58:47.001 --> 58:49.177
and not "Jason" or "Layton" or--

58:49.351 --> 58:52.224
- Who'’s Jason or Layton?
- I have no idea.
I'’m reaching.

58:52.398 --> 58:54.226
Listen, we both definitely
heard him say

58:54.400 --> 58:56.315
that tonight is the night
it all goes down.

58:56.968 --> 58:58.012
We gotta do somethin'’.

58:58.926 --> 58:59.971
Hey, guys.

59:00.145 --> 59:01.625
Sorry I'’m late.

59:01.799 --> 59:03.627
Gibby, you look so good.

59:03.801 --> 59:05.150
Everyone'’s talking about it.

59:05.324 --> 59:07.065
Thanks, Emma. [chuckles]

59:07.239 --> 59:09.371
I can'’t believe how much fun
that was last night, Liam.

59:09.546 --> 59:11.809
Yeah, that was pretty fun.

59:11.983 --> 59:13.375
You'’re so humble.

59:13.550 --> 59:15.856
You never let on at all
about any of your talents.

59:17.641 --> 59:18.685
I'’ma get a corn dog.

59:20.165 --> 59:21.601
Uh, do you guys want one?

59:21.775 --> 59:22.602
Sure.

59:22.776 --> 59:24.038
- Yeah.
- All right.

59:24.212 --> 59:25.257
Be right back.

59:26.737 --> 59:27.694
[sighs]

59:28.347 --> 59:29.304
Are you ready?

59:29.478 --> 59:30.523
Yeah.

59:32.786 --> 59:33.874
Go get him.

59:34.048 --> 59:35.180
Me?

59:35.354 --> 59:37.051
Yeah. You'’re--
He listens to you.

59:37.225 --> 59:38.313
[sighs]

59:40.664 --> 59:42.579
- I'’m the driver.
- Fine, fine.

59:47.627 --> 59:48.585
You got it.

59:51.022 --> 59:52.197
[vendor] Come and get them.

59:52.371 --> 59:54.982
Nitrates, sodium,
artificial flavors.

59:55.156 --> 59:56.680
Really bad for you.

59:56.854 --> 59:57.768
Oh, hey there, kid.

59:57.942 --> 59:59.465
What are you doing here?

59:59.639 --> 01:00:01.206
I'’m just staying close by,
you know,

01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:04.426
in case I'’m needed for, uh,
say, a third and final wish.

01:00:04.601 --> 01:00:06.907
Yeah, well, you won'’t be.

01:00:07.081 --> 01:00:08.779
And I wanna thank you
for your service.

01:00:08.953 --> 01:00:11.390
You wanna thank me
for my service?

01:00:11.564 --> 01:00:15.263
I'’m done.
I really don'’t need
anything else.

01:00:15.437 --> 01:00:18.527
Mm-hmm.
Can I ask you something?

01:00:18.702 --> 01:00:21.139
Why aren'’t you taking credit
for what you did for your buddy?

01:00:21.313 --> 01:00:23.358
What? Why should I?

01:00:23.532 --> 01:00:26.100
I mean, literally
the only reason to
do stuff for other people

01:00:26.274 --> 01:00:27.711
is to get the credit.

01:00:27.885 --> 01:00:29.147
So then they owe you something.

01:00:29.321 --> 01:00:31.062
What about doing
something nice for a person

01:00:31.236 --> 01:00:32.498
because you care about them?

01:00:32.672 --> 01:00:33.891
Like out of kindness.

01:00:34.065 --> 01:00:36.023
I don'’t even know
what you just said.

01:00:36.197 --> 01:00:38.809
I mean, I know all the words,
but I just never heard them
in that order.

01:00:38.983 --> 01:00:40.071
Like a selfless act.

01:00:40.245 --> 01:00:41.420
Still not following.

01:00:41.594 --> 01:00:42.769
Forget it.

01:00:44.553 --> 01:00:47.382
Hey, Mrs. Turner.
Is everything all right?

01:00:48.557 --> 01:00:50.342
I'’m Gibby, Liam'’s friend.

01:00:50.516 --> 01:00:52.518
The football player with cancer.

01:00:52.692 --> 01:00:54.563
Yeah, no, I know.
Gibby, hi.

01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:57.915
God,
you just look so healthy.

01:00:58.089 --> 01:01:01.440
The, uh, treatment
seems to really be working.

01:01:01.614 --> 01:01:04.008
Yes, it'’s, uh,
doing the trick.

01:01:04.182 --> 01:01:08.012
Have, um-- Have you seen Liam?
I-- I just need to talk to him
for a second.

01:01:08.186 --> 01:01:10.841
Yeah, he'’s over there
at the corn dog stand.

01:01:11.015 --> 01:01:12.886
Corn dog. Okay.
Thank you.

01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:14.061
Bye now.

01:01:15.976 --> 01:01:17.412
It was a pleasure
doing business with you,

01:01:17.586 --> 01:01:20.111
but I made my two wishes
and I wanna enjoy them.

01:01:20.285 --> 01:01:22.940
So no offense, but bye.

01:01:24.898 --> 01:01:27.727
Oh! Oh. And can I get
three corn dogs?

01:01:27.901 --> 01:01:30.034
Not a wish. I'’m paying cash.

01:01:30.208 --> 01:01:31.862
Coming right up!

01:01:32.036 --> 01:01:35.126
Three corn dogs,
extra goat lips.

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:36.649
On the house.

01:01:37.258 --> 01:01:38.477
Extra spicy.

01:01:41.001 --> 01:01:42.176
Enjoy.

01:01:43.395 --> 01:01:45.876
And don'’t chew
with your mouth open.
It'’s gross.

01:01:51.229 --> 01:01:53.274
Mom,
what are you doing here?

01:01:53.448 --> 01:01:56.016
Liam, I'’ve been looking for you.
I just need you to come with me, please.

01:01:56.190 --> 01:01:57.670
- Right now?
- Yeah, right now.

01:01:57.844 --> 01:01:59.063
But I'’m with my friends.

01:01:59.237 --> 01:02:00.673
Liam, honey,
this will only take a moment.

01:02:00.847 --> 01:02:03.589
Everything'’s okay.
Just come with me.

01:02:03.763 --> 01:02:05.852
What are you doing?
Why are you pulling me so hard?

01:02:06.026 --> 01:02:07.506
- Come on. Hey, come on.
- Emma and Gibby.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:08.899
Let'’s go, let'’s go.
It'’s okay.

01:02:09.073 --> 01:02:10.596
- I just-- I missed you.
- No-- Wait.

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:12.337
- I needed to see you quick.
- What'’s Daddy doing here?

01:02:12.511 --> 01:02:14.252
- Honey, how was the carnival?
- We loved the carnival.

01:02:14.426 --> 01:02:16.384
I got him! I got him!
- All right.
- Liam. Give me the corn dogs!

01:02:16.558 --> 01:02:18.082
Come on. I see it.[Liam] Wait! Help!

01:02:18.256 --> 01:02:20.606
- I see it. I got it.
- Be careful!
Don'’t hurt him.

01:02:20.780 --> 01:02:22.216
- I did it already.
- Liam, lean back.

01:02:22.390 --> 01:02:24.088
Let'’s go.

01:02:24.262 --> 01:02:26.525
Why are you doing this?[Molly]
Because we love you.

01:02:26.699 --> 01:02:29.049
This is a horrible way to
show it.
I'’m on a date.

01:02:29.223 --> 01:02:30.572
[Molly]
Of course you are.

01:02:38.755 --> 01:02:40.365
[exhales]

01:02:40.539 --> 01:02:41.540
[clears throat]

01:02:42.846 --> 01:02:44.935
Everything'’s gonna
be all right, Liam.

01:02:45.109 --> 01:02:48.852
We'’re gonna do a few tests
and keep you overnight.

01:02:49.026 --> 01:02:52.420
Now I'’m gonna go talk to
your parents
about a course of treatment.

01:02:53.204 --> 01:02:54.161
Be right back.

01:02:54.858 --> 01:02:56.860
Course of treatment?

01:02:57.034 --> 01:02:59.819
Take me to
Christmas carnival, please.

01:03:05.651 --> 01:03:07.696
What the hell
did they do to you, McMurphy?

01:03:07.871 --> 01:03:09.698
Who'’s McMurphy?

01:03:09.873 --> 01:03:11.962
[exclaims] <i>Cuckoo'’s Nest.</i>

01:03:12.136 --> 01:03:14.268

Now, listen up, comrade.

01:03:17.010 --> 01:03:18.664
I can get you out of here
in two seconds.

01:03:19.578 --> 01:03:20.971
- Really?
- Of course.

01:03:21.145 --> 01:03:22.755
You'’ve still got
your third wish, remember?

01:03:22.929 --> 01:03:25.192
Yeah, well,
I'’m not giving you my soul.

01:03:25.366 --> 01:03:26.890
No deal.

01:03:27.064 --> 01:03:29.153
Okay, your call.

01:03:29.327 --> 01:03:31.546
Just looks like your friends
are having so much fun

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:33.940

Christmas Carnival.

said goodbye, though.</i>

01:03:41.905 --> 01:03:43.210
I'’m not fine.

01:03:43.384 --> 01:03:44.908
[Emma]
<i>How are you doing, Gibby?</i>

01:03:45.082 --> 01:03:47.345
<i>Don'’t worry.
I won'’t tell anyone.</i>

01:03:47.519 --> 01:03:52.829
<i>I know how freaked out
people can get when they
find out someone has... cancer.</i>

01:03:53.003 --> 01:03:55.570
[Gibby] <i>Yeah.</i> Oh, you'’ve gotta be joking me.

not a person.</i>

you'’re really brave.</i>

He does not have
the moves at all.

01:04:17.070 --> 01:04:18.376
I don'’t know, Liam.

01:04:18.550 --> 01:04:21.161
Looks like
they'’re really hitting it off.

01:04:21.335 --> 01:04:26.558
<i>Gibby, do you mind me asking
what kind of cancer you have?</i>

01:04:34.087 --> 01:04:35.523
they make a cute couple.

01:04:35.697 --> 01:04:37.221
No, they do not!

01:04:37.395 --> 01:04:38.483
Stop it.

01:04:38.657 --> 01:04:40.572
I know what you'’re trying to do.

01:04:42.269 --> 01:04:44.010
I'’m not making my third wish.

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:45.794
Now get out of here.

01:04:45.969 --> 01:04:47.492
Okay, your call.

01:04:48.536 --> 01:04:51.191
I'’ll just head back to my room.

01:04:51.365 --> 01:04:53.411
You have a room over here?

01:04:53.585 --> 01:04:56.501
I'’m staying at
the Red Rum Motor Lodge.

01:04:56.675 --> 01:04:58.633
You can probably guess
my room number.

01:04:58.807 --> 01:05:00.679

01:05:03.812 --> 01:05:05.902

you didn'’t know.

Whatever this is, we'’ll--
we'’ll get through it together.

01:05:26.009 --> 01:05:28.794

Damn it!

01:05:34.452 --> 01:05:35.757
Well, what is it then?

01:05:35.932 --> 01:05:37.237
Why is he acting this way?

01:05:37.411 --> 01:05:40.284
Why are you acting this way?
This is good news.

01:05:41.546 --> 01:05:44.679
Talking about Lucifer
and-and Post Malone.

01:05:44.853 --> 01:05:45.985
That'’s good news?

01:05:46.159 --> 01:05:48.248
Be honest, Doc.
Is there any hope?

01:05:48.422 --> 01:05:52.252
Usually, I--
I'’m a "optimistic person,"

01:05:52.426 --> 01:05:54.385
but in this particular case,
I'’ve gotta tell you,

01:05:54.559 --> 01:05:56.256
the delusions seem to
be more acute--Dr. Finkleman.

01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:58.128
Do you know who that is
- in there?
- In where?

01:05:58.302 --> 01:06:00.130
In the imaging room.

01:06:00.304 --> 01:06:02.610
That'’s the kid that
blew Post Malone
off the stage last night.

01:06:02.784 --> 01:06:03.829
- What?
- No, no, no.

01:06:04.003 --> 01:06:05.526
Don'’t-- Don'’t listen to him.

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.354
He-- He'’s--
He'’s a little delirious
right now.

01:06:07.528 --> 01:06:09.226
Mmm. No. I was there.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.879
- Where?
- At the show.

01:06:11.054 --> 01:06:13.708
The kid killed.
He'’s a rock star.

01:06:13.882 --> 01:06:15.406
- Here.
- Is this person a patient?

I mean,
why would you believe that?

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.879
Because he said he was.

01:07:38.924 --> 01:07:39.838
And he'’s my son.

01:07:42.928 --> 01:07:45.931
You did everything
a good father would do.

So, making up a story
that I'’m dying
is your good deed?

01:09:04.575 --> 01:09:07.360
<i>No. Fixing your teeth
was my good deed.</i>

What? <i>That'’s right.</i>

01:09:09.406 --> 01:09:11.886
I used my second wish
to straighten out your teeth.

01:09:12.060 --> 01:09:13.932
I didn'’t go after Emma.

01:09:14.106 --> 01:09:16.282
And I never asked you to
fix my teeth.

01:09:16.456 --> 01:09:19.329

01:09:30.818 --> 01:09:32.385
Maybe he did meet the devil.

01:09:33.081 --> 01:09:35.083
Oh, come on.

01:09:35.258 --> 01:09:37.564
You'’re the one who said
that we should believe him.

Within reason.

01:09:38.913 --> 01:09:40.480
Bill, you saw him.

01:09:40.654 --> 01:09:42.830
He was singing and dancing
and he was playing beer pong.

01:09:43.004 --> 01:09:45.006
Our son can'’t do
any of those things.

01:09:46.269 --> 01:09:48.053
Maybe he was practicing
at school.

01:09:48.227 --> 01:09:50.229
Beer pong in middle school?

01:09:52.318 --> 01:09:54.190
Maybe it was lemonade pong.

01:09:54.886 --> 01:09:56.104
Okay, yeah.

01:09:56.279 --> 01:09:58.106
Well, obviously,
he'’s a natural.

01:09:58.890 --> 01:10:00.196
I mean, I was in a frat.

01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:01.719
Yes, we know.

01:10:03.895 --> 01:10:05.331
There'’s gotta be
some explanation.

01:10:06.158 --> 01:10:07.115
Yeah, maybe there is.

01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:09.205
Maybe he'’s telling the truth.

01:10:09.379 --> 01:10:11.729
Are you listening to
yourself, Molly?

01:10:11.903 --> 01:10:14.688
You'’re actually wondering
out loud if
there really is a devil?

01:10:14.862 --> 01:10:17.256
Well, if there isn'’t,
then who took Spencer from us?

01:10:18.562 --> 01:10:19.693
God?

01:10:21.391 --> 01:10:23.828

little brother
away from him?

01:10:36.406 --> 01:10:37.711
Where do you think
they come from?

01:10:37.885 --> 01:10:39.147
Stop it, Molly.

01:10:42.629 --> 01:10:46.198
Spencer didn'’t die
because of God or the devil.

01:10:47.330 --> 01:10:48.809
He died because--

01:10:48.983 --> 01:10:50.724
Because I let them play outside
without watching them.

01:10:50.898 --> 01:10:52.683
Just say it. It was my fault.

01:10:54.641 --> 01:10:56.730
- I didn'’t say that.
- But you were thinking it.

01:10:56.904 --> 01:10:59.603
Don'’t tell me
- what I'’m thinking, okay?
- You certainly don'’t tell me.

01:10:59.777 --> 01:11:02.083
[Bill]
Maybe it'’s because I don'’t know
what I think anymore!

Yeah, maybe you should.

it'’ll be better for everyone.

01:13:06.164 --> 01:13:10.037
<i>and all of a sudden,
I wake up
and it'’s the next day.</i>

01:13:10.211 --> 01:13:12.649
<i>And, uh, I don'’t even remember
what happened.</i>

01:13:12.823 --> 01:13:15.695
[laughs, bleats]

01:13:15.869 --> 01:13:18.350
<i>But I appreciate the love...</i> He didn'’t know what hit him.

01:13:18.524 --> 01:13:20.265
<i>...and, um,
I'’m doing great now.</i>

01:13:20.439 --> 01:13:22.267
<i>Well, that sure sounds scary.</i>

01:13:22.441 --> 01:13:23.747
<i>It sure is.
But you know what?</i>

01:13:23.921 --> 01:13:26.097
<i>His fans
weren'’t complaining at all.</i>

01:13:26.271 --> 01:13:29.361
<i>In fact, many in attendance
thought it was
one of his best shows ever.</i>

01:13:29.535 --> 01:13:32.451
Now that'’s
what I'’m talking about.[anchor] <i>We sure have.</i>

01:13:32.625 --> 01:13:34.932
Best show he'’s done in year--[knocks on door]

01:13:35.106 --> 01:13:36.586
Damn, Uber Eats is fast.

01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.805
Coming.

01:13:38.979 --> 01:13:41.329
Double stuffed pizza crust.

01:13:44.724 --> 01:13:46.030
Well, well, well.

01:13:47.727 --> 01:13:49.294
I wanna make my third wish.

01:13:50.121 --> 01:13:52.776
Please, come in.

01:13:55.039 --> 01:13:56.257
What are you wearing?

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:59.870
Oh, it'’s just
a little exercise thing

01:14:00.044 --> 01:14:01.654
I picked up at the store.

01:14:01.828 --> 01:14:03.830
Come on in.
Make yourself comfortable.

01:14:13.013 --> 01:14:14.928
Hey, Liam.

01:14:15.102 --> 01:14:17.453
I know you'’re upset,
but I just wanted to say
good night, okay?

01:14:19.150 --> 01:14:20.717
[sighs] Liam.

01:14:23.154 --> 01:14:24.285
Liam, come on.

01:14:27.071 --> 01:14:29.421
[wind whistling]

01:14:31.249 --> 01:14:32.946
Bill. Bill!

01:14:34.731 --> 01:14:36.820
So let me try to
get this straight.

01:14:36.994 --> 01:14:40.650
You'’re saying your third wish is
you want your parents to
not get a divorce?

01:14:42.521 --> 01:14:43.566
That'’s right.

01:14:44.654 --> 01:14:46.569
It'’s a little vague.
I mean, theoretically,

01:14:46.743 --> 01:14:48.875
they could stay together
but still be miserable.

01:14:49.049 --> 01:14:50.137
No.

01:14:50.311 --> 01:14:52.444
I want them to smile again.

01:14:52.618 --> 01:14:54.359
[sighs]
Go out to dinner.

01:14:54.533 --> 01:14:55.752
Watch a band.

01:14:56.579 --> 01:14:59.320
Hug, kiss, laugh.

01:14:59.495 --> 01:15:01.627
And not say horrible things
to each other.

01:15:02.715 --> 01:15:03.977
[sighs]

01:15:04.151 --> 01:15:06.023
That kind of staying together.

01:15:07.981 --> 01:15:09.113
Okay.

01:15:09.983 --> 01:15:10.984
So, you can do it?

01:15:11.724 --> 01:15:12.943
I'’m usually pro-divorce,

01:15:13.117 --> 01:15:15.467
but hell, yes, I can do it.

01:15:16.773 --> 01:15:18.862
So, then what will happen to me?

01:15:19.036 --> 01:15:20.516
Do I die
and go straight to hell?

01:15:20.690 --> 01:15:22.518
No, no, no, no, not yet.

01:15:22.692 --> 01:15:24.824
Not for a good 70 to 85 years

01:15:24.998 --> 01:15:27.827
if you watch your weight
and get your
10,000 steps a day in.

01:15:28.741 --> 01:15:30.830
Until then,
do me a favor.

01:15:32.136 --> 01:15:33.137
Have some fun.

01:15:34.051 --> 01:15:35.531
What kind of fun?

01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:37.228
Fun, fun.

01:15:37.402 --> 01:15:38.534
You'’re literally
going to hell.

01:15:38.708 --> 01:15:40.448
You might as well
have fun with it.

01:15:40.623 --> 01:15:42.102
Be a jerk.

01:15:42.276 --> 01:15:43.539
Don'’t hold the door.

01:15:43.713 --> 01:15:46.411
In fact,
slam the door in people'’s faces.

01:15:46.585 --> 01:15:48.848
Rip a juicy one
on the bus.

01:15:50.415 --> 01:15:52.504
Tell people
what you really think about '’em
right to their face,

01:15:52.678 --> 01:15:54.027
even if it'’s rude.

01:15:54.201 --> 01:15:55.768
Feels good.

01:15:57.248 --> 01:15:58.945
What if I enjoy
being nice to people?

01:15:59.119 --> 01:16:01.121
[blows raspberry]
You don'’t.

01:16:01.295 --> 01:16:03.776
You just believe you do
because you'’re worried about
what people think.

01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:05.082
How do you know?

01:16:05.256 --> 01:16:06.779
I may be Satan,

01:16:06.953 --> 01:16:09.652
but I'’m also a keen observer of
the human "condish."

01:16:09.826 --> 01:16:10.957
Now, come on, kid.

01:16:11.828 --> 01:16:12.829
Let'’s make it official.

01:16:13.003 --> 01:16:14.613
[breathes deeply]

01:16:15.309 --> 01:16:16.702
How?

01:16:16.876 --> 01:16:21.272
In a clear voice--
no mumbling-- just say,

01:16:21.446 --> 01:16:25.363
"With this third and final wish,
Satan, you now have my soul,"

01:16:26.059 --> 01:16:27.365
and then ask for the wish.

01:16:27.539 --> 01:16:29.933
[breathes deeply]

01:16:30.107 --> 01:16:33.458
With this third
and final wish, Satan,

01:16:33.632 --> 01:16:36.417
you now have my soul.[mouthing]
You now have my soul.

01:16:36.592 --> 01:16:37.767
[thunder rumbles]

01:16:38.681 --> 01:16:41.161
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.[exhales]

01:16:42.249 --> 01:16:43.555
Go ahead now.

01:16:43.729 --> 01:16:45.035
Ask for the third wishie.

01:16:49.387 --> 01:16:52.564
Imagine getting
to see your mom smile again.

01:16:52.738 --> 01:16:54.261
A real smile, guilt-free.

01:16:54.435 --> 01:16:55.654
Your dad too.

01:16:59.049 --> 01:17:04.010
I wish my parents
would stay together,
in love, forever.

01:17:05.142 --> 01:17:07.100
Sucker!

01:17:08.145 --> 01:17:10.190
[laughs]
I'’m just messing with you.

01:17:10.364 --> 01:17:12.540
Congrats.
Welcome to the squad.

01:17:15.152 --> 01:17:17.067
What? Why so blue?

01:17:17.241 --> 01:17:18.590
Why so blue?

01:17:18.764 --> 01:17:21.158
I just sold my soul to
the devil.

01:17:21.332 --> 01:17:22.768
[chuckles] Adorable.

01:17:22.942 --> 01:17:24.335
Totes adorbs.

01:17:24.509 --> 01:17:26.163
That'’s what they all say
at first,

01:17:26.337 --> 01:17:28.731
but once you get the hang of it,
you'’re gonna have a blast.

01:17:28.905 --> 01:17:30.820
Ooh, I get goose bumps
just thinking about it.

01:17:30.994 --> 01:17:32.952
You never understand.

01:17:35.041 --> 01:17:36.608
Aw, cheer up, dude.

01:17:38.001 --> 01:17:39.176
Slam that door.

01:17:40.046 --> 01:17:40.786

01:17:54.757 --> 01:17:56.802
Where is he?
Where could he be?

01:17:56.976 --> 01:17:59.892
He was angry.
He probably went for a walk.

01:18:00.066 --> 01:18:01.677
[exhales]

01:18:01.851 --> 01:18:05.637
Look, let me just pull over
for a minute
so I can think.

I don'’t wanna fight with you
anymore about Liam.

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:28.616
I know you think
I'’m the one to blame
for all of this.

01:18:29.661 --> 01:18:31.097
What are you talking about?

01:18:31.271 --> 01:18:32.925
I let him believe in Santa.

01:18:33.099 --> 01:18:35.319
I baby him.
I don'’t challenge him enough.

01:18:39.453 --> 01:18:41.238
Molly,
I don'’t blame you for this.

01:18:42.413 --> 01:18:44.328
And I never blamed you
for Spencer.

01:18:45.677 --> 01:18:48.332
The truth is,
if I blame anyone...

01:18:50.595 --> 01:18:51.727
it was me.

01:18:52.728 --> 01:18:53.772
You?

01:18:54.730 --> 01:18:55.905
Why?

01:18:56.079 --> 01:18:59.343
Why was I
not there that day?

01:19:01.301 --> 01:19:03.564
What was so important
that I couldn'’t be there?

01:19:06.829 --> 01:19:08.091
I was golfing.

01:19:09.353 --> 01:19:10.963
Can you believe that?
I was fricking golfing.

01:19:11.137 --> 01:19:13.923
It was a Saturday, Bill.

01:19:14.097 --> 01:19:16.229
You were out having
a little bit of fun
with your friends.

01:19:16.403 --> 01:19:17.883
There'’s nothing wrong with that.

01:19:20.712 --> 01:19:22.192
It wasn'’t your fault.

01:19:22.366 --> 01:19:23.933
And it wasn'’t yours.

01:19:27.110 --> 01:19:28.546
It was an accident.

01:19:31.984 --> 01:19:33.594
It wasn'’t your fault.

01:19:35.118 --> 01:19:36.772
It was nobody'’s fault.

01:19:38.730 --> 01:19:41.689
It'’s the first time
you'’ve ever said that.

01:19:44.127 --> 01:19:46.216
I guess I just
didn'’t wanna talk about it.

01:19:48.435 --> 01:19:52.222
Yeah, well, I did.

01:19:53.571 --> 01:19:54.746
And I needed to.

I'’m sorry.

I'’m so sorry.

01:20:07.063 --> 01:20:08.368
I'’m sorry too.

01:20:22.905 --> 01:20:24.515

- Oh, thank God.

till you hear the word "go."

Go. There.

do I have to say this?

You don'’t know.

Are all your insults that good?

01:22:17.671 --> 01:22:20.892
Do you just describe something
a person did
but in a snarky tone?

to be nice to you.

and tiresome.

I'’m gonna tell you the truth.

You'’re so insecure
about yourself,

any personality,

01:23:34.618 --> 01:23:37.882
Hmm? That tasty
17th-century delicacy.

01:23:38.056 --> 01:23:39.362
Other than me, obviously.

01:23:41.277 --> 01:23:44.062
Liar. You are a liar, son.

01:23:45.107 --> 01:23:47.457
I want you bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed

01:23:47.631 --> 01:23:53.028
as we discuss probably
one of the most overrated books
in history,

01:23:53.941 --> 01:23:56.379
<i>To Kill a Mockingbird.</i>

01:23:56.553 --> 01:23:59.817
Now, if I was publisher,
I would'’ve titled it
<i>To Kill a Manuscript.</i>

01:23:59.991 --> 01:24:01.079
[chuckles]

01:24:01.253 --> 01:24:02.646
Oh, Mr. Turner,

01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:05.997
is your head
in the clouds again?

01:24:06.171 --> 01:24:08.565
Don'’t start with me today, bud.
Not in the mood.

01:24:12.003 --> 01:24:13.352
What did you just say to me?

01:24:13.526 --> 01:24:14.919
Did I stutter?

01:24:16.138 --> 01:24:19.402
Mr. Turner, what on earth
has gotten into you?

01:24:19.576 --> 01:24:22.709
I'’m just getting tired
of your act.

01:24:22.883 --> 01:24:24.276
My act, is it?

01:24:24.450 --> 01:24:26.713
Yeah, constantly putting down
great books

01:24:26.887 --> 01:24:29.455
to help you feel better
about your own failures.

01:24:29.629 --> 01:24:31.588
I mean,
what have you ever written?

01:24:32.763 --> 01:24:34.112
Nothing, right?

01:24:34.286 --> 01:24:35.722
Nothing good, anyway,

01:24:35.896 --> 01:24:37.594
or you wouldn'’t be
a sixth-grade English teacher.

01:24:43.513 --> 01:24:45.863
Wow. That was
quite the kill shot there, Liam.

01:24:48.822 --> 01:24:50.520
You actually might have a point.

01:24:52.609 --> 01:24:57.570
Certainly, my father
and ex-wife would agree
with your assessment.

01:25:09.843 --> 01:25:11.236
[bell ringing]

01:25:12.977 --> 01:25:14.021
Emma.

01:25:18.113 --> 01:25:19.114
Emma, wait.

01:25:19.679 --> 01:25:20.724
What?

01:25:21.551 --> 01:25:22.987
Oh, I wanted to apologize

01:25:23.161 --> 01:25:24.815
for running out
in the middle of our date.

01:25:25.642 --> 01:25:26.860
Don'’t worry about it.

01:25:27.034 --> 01:25:28.862
Gibby told me
your mom needed you at home.

01:25:31.909 --> 01:25:33.258
You wanna walk home
together?

01:25:34.172 --> 01:25:35.042
I don'’t think so.

01:25:35.217 --> 01:25:36.131
Oh.

01:25:36.305 --> 01:25:38.045
Um, why?

01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:39.656
You were a jerk.

01:25:41.397 --> 01:25:42.180
What?

01:25:42.354 --> 01:25:44.530
In class with Mr. Charles.

01:25:44.704 --> 01:25:46.576
You were totally soul-crushing.

01:25:46.750 --> 01:25:49.579
You called him a failure
in front of the whole class.

01:25:52.059 --> 01:25:55.411
You know, I broke up with Aiden
because I thought
I found someone nice.

01:25:56.151 --> 01:25:57.587
Turns out I was wrong.

01:25:57.761 --> 01:25:59.284
You'’re nothing but a bully.

01:26:01.243 --> 01:26:02.244
Goodbye.

01:26:03.723 --> 01:26:05.116
[crying]

01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:12.341
<i>We'’re gonna go back-to-back.
On three. We'’re doing bubble judging.</i>

01:26:12.515 --> 01:26:14.343
<i>We'’ll see who-- Dad, can you count to three?</i>

01:26:14.517 --> 01:26:17.868
<i>Yeah. One, two, three.</i>[Molly] <i>Spencer, that'’s...</i>
[laughs]

01:26:18.042 --> 01:26:19.522
[Bill] <i>Count down. Okay, ready?</i>

01:26:19.696 --> 01:26:21.088
[Bill] <i>All right,
Mom'’s gonna count it down.</i>

01:26:21.263 --> 01:26:23.395
[Molly] <i>Three, two, one.</i>

01:26:23.569 --> 01:26:26.093
<i>Guys, on one. Okay.</i>[Bill] <i>It'’s a duel.</i>
[chuckles]

01:26:26.268 --> 01:26:29.053
<i>I didn'’t know
what was happening.</i>[all whooping]

01:26:29.227 --> 01:26:31.142
<i>I'’m gonna catch it.
I'’m gonna catch it.</i>[Liam] <i>It'’s like a hot dog.</i>

01:26:31.316 --> 01:26:33.840
<i>Yeah, be very gentle.
Like it'’s your child.</i>

01:26:34.014 --> 01:26:36.060
[parents exclaim, laugh]

01:26:36.234 --> 01:26:37.757
[Spencer]
<i>Good job, Mom.
You did so good.</i>

01:26:37.931 --> 01:26:39.977
[Bill]
<i>The biggest bubble
that lasted that long.</i>

01:26:40.151 --> 01:26:42.980
<i>High five. That was beautiful.</i>[Molly] <i>My number one--
My number one fan.</i>

01:26:43.546 --> 01:26:46.201
[line ringing]

01:26:46.375 --> 01:26:48.377
[Liam] <i>I'’m trying to slice
these bubbles.[Bill] Wait, Liam. Wait.</i>

01:26:50.770 --> 01:26:52.207
[chimes]

01:26:52.381 --> 01:26:54.121
Hey.[Gibby] <i>Hey.</i>

01:26:54.296 --> 01:26:55.862
<i>Whatcha doing?</i>

01:26:56.646 --> 01:26:57.995
Nothing.

01:26:58.169 --> 01:26:59.866
Just watching
old videos of my brother.

01:27:00.563 --> 01:27:01.564
You have a brother?

01:27:01.738 --> 01:27:03.043
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:27:03.218 --> 01:27:04.654
<i>Well, I used to.</i>

01:27:04.828 --> 01:27:07.352
<i>Spencer, he, um-- he died.</i>

01:27:07.526 --> 01:27:09.528
What?

01:27:09.702 --> 01:27:12.009
Why didn'’t you ever
tell me that? <i>You wouldn'’t let me, remember?</i>

01:27:12.183 --> 01:27:14.185
<i>You wanted to talk about
the Impossible Burger lasagna.</i>

01:27:14.359 --> 01:27:16.535
Oh, by the way,
I tried it. It is good.

01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:18.276
Oh, crap.

01:27:18.450 --> 01:27:20.104
<i>I'’m so, so sorry.</i>

01:27:21.540 --> 01:27:22.759
<i>That'’s a rough one, man.</i>

01:27:22.933 --> 01:27:24.239
Thanks, Gibby.

01:27:25.588 --> 01:27:28.068
I'’m really sorry
about what I said
the other night.

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:32.029
I know you weren'’t trying to,
you know, with Emma.

01:27:32.203 --> 01:27:34.074
I would hope not.

01:27:34.249 --> 01:27:36.120
What kind of monster
do you think I am, man?

01:27:36.294 --> 01:27:37.817
It'’s Satan'’s fault.

01:27:37.991 --> 01:27:39.993
He made me suspicious.

01:27:40.167 --> 01:27:42.039
Isn'’t that one of
the seven deadly sins?

01:27:42.213 --> 01:27:43.649
Are there really seven?

01:27:45.347 --> 01:27:46.696
What chance do we have?

01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:49.394
[sighs]
<i>Actually, it'’s my fault too.</i>

01:27:49.568 --> 01:27:52.484
<i>I should'’ve never fixed
your teeth
without your permission.</i>

01:27:53.877 --> 01:27:55.139
<i>I was drunk with power.</i>

01:27:55.922 --> 01:27:57.881
<i>Well, I'’m sorry too.</i>

01:27:59.099 --> 01:28:00.536
<i>I kinda suspected</i>

01:28:00.710 --> 01:28:04.627
<i>you were the one
who, you know, fixed my teeth.</i>

01:28:04.801 --> 01:28:05.715
You did?

01:28:05.889 --> 01:28:08.326
Come on, I'’m not an idiot.

01:28:08.500 --> 01:28:11.808
I guess I just didn'’t wanna
admit that Satan
was helping me too.

01:28:11.982 --> 01:28:14.898
Yeah, I guess there is
a bit of a stigma to that.

01:28:16.073 --> 01:28:17.422
<i>I was being a jerk.</i>

01:28:18.249 --> 01:28:19.381
<i>I mean,</i>

01:28:19.555 --> 01:28:22.732
<i>you used
your last freebie wish on me.</i>

01:28:22.906 --> 01:28:25.300
You could'’ve fixed
your own physical malformities,

01:28:25.474 --> 01:28:26.953
but instead, you thought of me.

01:28:27.127 --> 01:28:28.477
<i>That'’s pretty cool.</i>

01:28:28.651 --> 01:28:30.261
What physical malformities?

01:28:30.435 --> 01:28:31.436
Huh?

01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:35.875
Anyway, Merry Christmas, Liam.

01:28:36.615 --> 01:28:37.747
<i>You too, Gib.</i>

01:28:37.921 --> 01:28:38.835
<i>You'’re a good friend.</i>

01:28:39.009 --> 01:28:41.446
<i>Right back at ya, bestie.</i>

01:28:41.620 --> 01:28:44.319
<i>So, what do you think
happened to Satan?</i>

01:28:44.493 --> 01:28:48.235
[Liam] <i>Meh,
I'’m sure he'’s back down there,
sitting on his throne.</i>

01:29:02.162 --> 01:29:05.557
Welcome back to hell,
my loyal subject.

01:29:05.731 --> 01:29:07.167
I trust you traveled safely.

01:29:07.342 --> 01:29:09.735
Yes, your lowness.
Thank you for asking.

01:29:09.909 --> 01:29:11.520
It was a smooth trip, indeed.

01:29:11.694 --> 01:29:14.566
I was being facetious,
you dumbass.

01:29:16.046 --> 01:29:19.223
Not only did you go rogue
without my permission,

01:29:19.397 --> 01:29:22.357
you also failed miserably
on your mission.

01:29:22.531 --> 01:29:23.923
I can'’t take that kid'’s soul.

01:29:24.097 --> 01:29:25.708
W-W-Why not?

01:29:25.882 --> 01:29:28.493
I'’ll tell you...
[mock stammers] ...why not.

01:29:29.276 --> 01:29:31.278
'’Cause you screwed the pooch.

01:29:31.453 --> 01:29:34.020
That was only once,
and I was going through a thing.

01:29:34.194 --> 01:29:35.674
First of all, ew.

01:29:35.848 --> 01:29:38.416
And I mean
you screwed up big time.

01:29:38.590 --> 01:29:43.073
So, your deal with this kid,
Liam, is null and void.

01:29:43.247 --> 01:29:44.596
Null and void?

01:29:44.770 --> 01:29:47.033
- Mm-hmm. It'’s a legal term.
- I know that.

01:29:47.207 --> 01:29:49.427
No. I don'’t know
if you know it.

01:29:49.601 --> 01:29:52.256
'’Cause when I said
"null and void," you said
"null and void?" Like that.

01:29:52.430 --> 01:29:54.084
Like you didn'’t have
any idea what that meant.

01:29:54.258 --> 01:29:56.303
- I know null and void.
- Hang on a second.

01:29:56.478 --> 01:30:00.482
Just out of curiosity,
what-what is the definition of
null and void, hmm?

01:30:00.656 --> 01:30:04.224
Null and void,
I think it means, like...

01:30:04.399 --> 01:30:07.532
"Null" means, like, "no."

01:30:07.706 --> 01:30:08.925
And "void" means--

01:30:09.099 --> 01:30:11.014
I mean, "void" means
"null and void."

01:30:11.188 --> 01:30:12.494
You know, null and void.

01:30:12.668 --> 01:30:15.105
Okay, so, null and void
means "null and void"?

01:30:15.279 --> 01:30:17.107
Yes. [chuckles]

01:30:17.281 --> 01:30:20.763
That'’s like saying hippopotamus
means, uh, "hippopotamus."

01:30:20.937 --> 01:30:22.852
Okay,
I don'’t know null and void.

01:30:23.026 --> 01:30:24.897
But how did I screw up?

01:30:25.071 --> 01:30:27.422
I got him to ask for
the three wishes,
fair and square.

01:30:27.596 --> 01:30:31.164
They'’re supposed to be
evil wishes, you moron.

01:30:31.338 --> 01:30:33.950
Or at least shallow
and greedy wishes.

01:30:34.124 --> 01:30:37.606
He asked me to be with
a cute girl.
That'’s shallow and greedy.

01:30:37.780 --> 01:30:40.739
Yeah, but, I mean,
you tricked him into it.

01:30:40.913 --> 01:30:44.264
Oh, come on.
He wanted her.
You know that.

01:30:44.439 --> 01:30:46.484
Okay. Maybe he did. All right.
I'’ll give you that one.

01:30:46.658 --> 01:30:49.748
But the other two
were definitely pure
and for the benefit of others.

01:30:49.922 --> 01:30:52.490
I mean, how the hell
am I supposed to work
with someone like that?

01:30:52.664 --> 01:30:57.800
Plus, B-T-Dubs, you got a soul
under false pretenses.

01:30:57.974 --> 01:30:59.366
But that'’s our MO.

01:30:59.541 --> 01:31:02.326
Since when do we not operate
under false pretenses?

01:31:02.500 --> 01:31:04.067
You pretended to be me.

01:31:04.241 --> 01:31:07.418
Never. I never said I was you.

01:31:07.592 --> 01:31:11.117
I explained how there was no way
that I was you,

01:31:11.291 --> 01:31:12.728
that there was only
one real Satan, you,

01:31:12.902 --> 01:31:15.426
and how the rest of us
just aid and serve you,

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:19.648
but that, without question, you,
your lowness,
are the one and only big D--

01:31:19.822 --> 01:31:20.649
You'’re lying.

01:31:21.693 --> 01:31:23.739
Yeah. I mean, of course.
[chuckling]

01:31:23.913 --> 01:31:25.175
I'’m a liar.

01:31:25.349 --> 01:31:28.047
Now, take off
those bullshit horns already!

01:31:28.744 --> 01:31:30.963
Oh. [chuckles] Yeah. Uh...

01:31:31.137 --> 01:31:35.228
[grunts]
I was just wearing them
until I earned my real horns.

01:31:35.402 --> 01:31:38.275
Yeah, well,
that'’s not happening.

01:31:38.449 --> 01:31:42.148
You'’re not getting horns,
and you'’ll never be
a real demon.

01:31:42.322 --> 01:31:44.542
What? Come on!

01:31:44.716 --> 01:31:46.413
Can'’t you just give me
one more shot at it?

01:31:46.588 --> 01:31:48.415
That kid
was a tough nut to crack.

01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:50.983
I tried everything.
He was incorruptible.

01:31:51.157 --> 01:31:54.117
Look, no offense,
but just-- I mean...

01:31:54.291 --> 01:31:55.901
It'’s just not
a good fit anymore.
You know?

01:31:56.075 --> 01:31:57.947
[laughs]

01:31:58.121 --> 01:32:01.646
What are you talking about?
I busted my ass for you
for centuries.

01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:03.169
I understand,

01:32:03.343 --> 01:32:05.868
but some "demigorgons"
and demidemons

01:32:06.042 --> 01:32:08.348
are just not meant
to be full demons, okay?

01:32:08.523 --> 01:32:09.741
Sorry.

01:32:09.915 --> 01:32:11.090
It'’s not me, it'’s you.

01:32:11.264 --> 01:32:12.439
Seriously?

01:32:12.614 --> 01:32:15.965
You have one hour to
say your bye-byes.

01:32:17.227 --> 01:32:18.271
Wow.

01:32:22.362 --> 01:32:23.407
Tootles.

01:32:26.845 --> 01:32:28.543
That'’s the first time
I'’ve ever said "tootles."

01:32:28.717 --> 01:32:31.850
I-I never say that.
Just so you know.

01:32:32.024 --> 01:32:34.418
[Satan]
That was the first time
I said "B-T-Dubs."

01:32:35.201 --> 01:32:36.333
[groans]

01:32:43.514 --> 01:32:45.255
[taps on glass][squawking]

01:32:48.954 --> 01:32:51.217
[taps on glass][squawks]

01:32:51.391 --> 01:32:52.654
Satan?

01:32:52.828 --> 01:32:54.917
No, it'’s Santy Claus.
Open the window!

01:32:58.398 --> 01:32:59.965
[squawks]

01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:03.447
[squawks]

01:33:04.230 --> 01:33:05.884
[snorts, groans]

01:33:06.058 --> 01:33:07.886
- Deal'’s off.
- What?

01:33:08.060 --> 01:33:10.149
The deal'’s off.
I can'’t take your soul.

01:33:10.323 --> 01:33:12.848
What are you talking about?
Why is it off?

01:33:14.458 --> 01:33:16.068
I decided I didn'’t want it.

01:33:16.242 --> 01:33:17.722
Why didn'’t you want my soul?

01:33:17.896 --> 01:33:19.289
Uh...

01:33:19.463 --> 01:33:21.378
Wasn'’t my type.

01:33:21.552 --> 01:33:23.728
It'’s a long story.
The bottom line is,
you have your soul back

01:33:23.902 --> 01:33:25.730
and you'’re never going to hell.
Sorry.

01:33:25.904 --> 01:33:27.993
Wait.
If you didn'’t have my soul,

01:33:28.167 --> 01:33:31.083
then how was I able to
talk trash to Mr. Charles

01:33:31.257 --> 01:33:33.608
and the crossing guard

01:33:33.782 --> 01:33:35.305
and stand up to Aiden?

01:33:35.479 --> 01:33:36.436
Kinda.

01:33:37.742 --> 01:33:39.265
That wasn'’t me.

01:33:39.439 --> 01:33:42.312
You were finally
standing up for yourself.

01:33:42.486 --> 01:33:45.184
Though I did think you were
a little hard on Mr. Charles.

01:33:45.358 --> 01:33:46.533
You thought so too?

01:33:46.708 --> 01:33:48.448
A little.

01:33:48.623 --> 01:33:51.147
Wait. Why would you come
all the way here
just to tell me that?

01:33:51.321 --> 01:33:53.149
Um, I'’m considerate.

01:33:53.323 --> 01:33:55.107
Satan isn'’t considerate.

01:33:55.281 --> 01:33:56.326
That'’s a stereotype.

01:33:56.500 --> 01:33:57.632
Satan can be complex.

01:33:57.806 --> 01:33:59.721
I mean, I can be complex.

01:34:01.287 --> 01:34:03.550
You don'’t have your--
You'’re not Satan.

01:34:03.725 --> 01:34:04.726
Uh...

01:34:06.118 --> 01:34:07.424
I never said I was.

01:34:07.598 --> 01:34:09.426
Yes, you did.
Numerous times!

01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:11.863
[groans] Sorry.
Caught me in a lie.

01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:15.824
I knew
you weren'’t really Satan.

01:34:15.998 --> 01:34:18.348
Why would Satan stay
at the Red Rum Motor Lodge?

01:34:18.522 --> 01:34:20.350
They got free Wi-Fi.

01:34:22.047 --> 01:34:23.483
And I like their croissants.

01:34:24.963 --> 01:34:26.138
So, who are you?

01:34:27.052 --> 01:34:28.793
I was just a low-level demon.

01:34:29.533 --> 01:34:30.577
"Demigorgon."

01:34:31.448 --> 01:34:32.754
A fraud.

01:34:32.928 --> 01:34:33.929
[sighs]

01:34:35.191 --> 01:34:36.192
So that'’s it?

01:34:37.193 --> 01:34:39.238
Yep.
You get to keep your soul

01:34:39.412 --> 01:34:41.371
and you'’re never
gonna go to hell.

01:34:41.545 --> 01:34:44.983
And thanks to
your candy-ass wishes,
I'’m banished from hell forever.

01:34:45.636 --> 01:34:46.811
Oh, geez.

01:34:47.856 --> 01:34:49.422
I'’m so sorry about that.
I--

01:34:50.554 --> 01:34:52.425
Ah, it'’s all right.

01:34:53.905 --> 01:34:56.081
Hell ain'’t all
it'’s cracked up to be.

01:34:56.908 --> 01:34:57.822
[scoffs]

01:34:57.996 --> 01:34:59.694
Talk about your horrible bosses.

01:35:01.521 --> 01:35:04.829
[sighs] Anyway, kid,
Merry Christmas.

01:35:05.395 --> 01:35:06.483
Thank you.

01:35:06.657 --> 01:35:08.180
Merry Christmas to you too.

01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:12.184
I'’m sort of ashamed to
admit it,

01:35:12.358 --> 01:35:15.318
but I really enjoyed hanging out
with you
and getting to know you.

01:35:17.320 --> 01:35:18.713
You'’re a good kid, Liam.

01:35:19.975 --> 01:35:21.019
Thank you.

01:35:21.193 --> 01:35:22.978
You'’re very welcome.

01:35:23.935 --> 01:35:25.894
And I like Emma too.
She'’s a doll.

01:35:26.590 --> 01:35:29.158
And Gibby... [chuckles]

01:35:29.332 --> 01:35:34.163
How much fun was that seeing him
with those new teeth?
That smile.

01:35:34.337 --> 01:35:36.948
Did you see that joy,
that little glimmer in his eye?

01:35:37.122 --> 01:35:39.124
That kid'’s got a heart of gold.

01:35:39.777 --> 01:35:41.300
His old teeth, yikes.

01:35:41.474 --> 01:35:43.172
You could open up
a bottle of beer
on those chompers.

01:35:43.346 --> 01:35:45.696
[laughs]
I mean, bottle of pop.

01:35:48.655 --> 01:35:50.440
So, what are you gonna do
with yourself?

01:35:50.614 --> 01:35:54.270
For Christmas?
I usually order Chinese
and watch some hoops.

01:35:55.140 --> 01:35:57.534
No. I mean, like,
for good?

01:35:58.230 --> 01:36:00.015
Oh.

01:36:00.189 --> 01:36:03.366
I actually feel like
I'’m starting a new chapter
of my life,

01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:04.976
and it'’s pretty refreshing.

01:36:05.150 --> 01:36:07.631
[chuckles] It'’s a totally
different career path.

01:36:07.805 --> 01:36:11.156
Anyhoo, I gotta go now.
[chuckles]

01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:12.549
Oh, yeah!

01:36:12.723 --> 01:36:14.159
One more thing.

01:36:14.333 --> 01:36:15.900
Your third wish
was null and void.

01:36:16.074 --> 01:36:17.597
What? What do you mean?

01:36:17.772 --> 01:36:19.469
Don'’t ask me
about null and void.

01:36:19.643 --> 01:36:22.211
It'’s a legal term.
Very complicated.

01:36:22.385 --> 01:36:25.997
The point is
you can'’t wish for something
that'’s already happened.

01:36:26.171 --> 01:36:29.871
Your parents got back together
on their own,
so that canceled out your wish.

01:36:30.045 --> 01:36:32.177
- Wh-- Really?
- Really.

01:36:32.351 --> 01:36:34.789
So it turns out
you had another wish coming.

01:36:34.963 --> 01:36:37.704
I didn'’t have much time,
so I just put in what
you asked for in your letter.

01:36:37.879 --> 01:36:40.795
My letter? I thought you said
you didn'’t read it.

01:36:40.969 --> 01:36:44.450
Oh, I was in the bathroom
doing my business
and I needed something.

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:46.844
My letter.

01:36:47.845 --> 01:36:49.760
I didn'’t know
I could wish for that.

01:36:50.805 --> 01:36:52.719
You can wish for
anything you want, kid.

01:36:53.590 --> 01:36:54.765
It'’s Christmas.

01:36:57.507 --> 01:36:59.117
See ya!

01:37:00.553 --> 01:37:02.120

01:37:27.058 --> 01:37:28.146
[laughs]

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:30.583
- Rudolph the Reindeer pastries.
- Bill!

01:37:30.757 --> 01:37:34.109
Okay, first off,
it'’s Rudolph
the Red-Nosed Reindeer.

01:37:34.283 --> 01:37:37.068
Wha--And these are actually
your all-time worst.

01:37:37.242 --> 01:37:39.375
- What?
- They--
They look like seals.

01:37:39.549 --> 01:37:40.593
- Seals?
- Yeah.

01:37:40.767 --> 01:37:41.943
- No, they'’ve got antlers.
- No.

01:37:42.117 --> 01:37:43.161
- They'’re anatomically correct.
- Okay.

01:37:43.335 --> 01:37:45.120
[Bill] I-- Don'’t--[Molly] No.

01:37:45.294 --> 01:37:47.557
[parents laughing]
Like, why are you...
I think I nailed the back.

01:37:49.254 --> 01:37:51.256
[parents continue talking
indistinctly]

01:37:53.215 --> 01:37:56.174
[Bill]
...nice touch, gumdrop nose...[Molly laughing]

01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:59.177
[Bill]
I think I nailed the back.

01:38:03.486 --> 01:38:06.706

that I'’m writing you
this letter.</i>

01:38:06.881 --> 01:38:09.579
<i>After all, I'’m 11.</i>

01:38:09.753 --> 01:38:12.887
<i>But, hey,
I figure it can'’t hurt.</i>

01:38:14.236 --> 01:38:15.280
[laughing]

01:38:16.673 --> 01:38:18.980
[Liam]
<i>I know this is
a crazy thing to ask for.</i>

01:38:19.154 --> 01:38:21.330
Thank you so much.
Thank you. I just--You got it. Yeah.

01:38:21.504 --> 01:38:26.683
[Liam] <i>But if anyone
is used to being asked
for crazy things, it'’s you.</i>

01:38:28.076 --> 01:38:29.773
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

01:38:31.949 --> 01:38:34.256
- Well, look who'’s up.
- Merry Christmas, buddy.

01:38:34.430 --> 01:38:36.127
Why don'’t you go see
what Santa brought you?

01:38:36.301 --> 01:38:38.564
[Liam] <i>I only want
one thing for Christmas.</i>

01:38:39.957 --> 01:38:41.741
<i>And I'’m pretty sure</i>

01:38:41.916 --> 01:38:44.005
<i>I'’ll only want
one thing for
the rest of my life.</i>

01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:47.008
<i>Please, please...</i>

01:38:49.271 --> 01:38:50.750
<i>can you bring my brother back?</i>

01:38:52.317 --> 01:38:53.188
Yes!

01:38:54.058 --> 01:38:55.842
[breathing heavily]

01:39:01.544 --> 01:39:03.633
Hey, Liam. Merry Christmas.

01:39:06.897 --> 01:39:09.987
[crying]
What are you waiting for?
Open up your presents.

01:39:10.161 --> 01:39:11.162
I just did.

01:39:13.469 --> 01:39:14.600
What are you doing?

01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:18.735
Mom, can you tell Liam to
stop it?

01:39:18.909 --> 01:39:20.389
[Molly chuckles]

01:39:20.563 --> 01:39:21.868
[sobbing]

01:39:22.043 --> 01:39:23.609
I love you so much.

01:39:23.783 --> 01:39:27.048
Okay, okay. I love you too.
Ma, tell him to let go of me.

01:39:27.222 --> 01:39:29.659
You know how much
Liam loves Christmas, Spence.

01:39:29.833 --> 01:39:32.227
- Get '’em while they'’re hot!
- Oh, no.

01:39:33.054 --> 01:39:34.446
- Wow.
- Chef Dad.

01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:35.926
So delicious. Thanks.

01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:37.710
- Who'’s this from?
- The Harrisons.

01:39:37.884 --> 01:39:39.147
From the old neighborhood?[Molly] Yeah.

01:39:39.321 --> 01:39:40.670
Yeah. I liked them.

01:39:40.844 --> 01:39:42.498
They had a skating rink
in their backyard

01:39:42.672 --> 01:39:43.760
and the pug who chased pucks.

01:39:43.934 --> 01:39:45.762
That'’s right.
God, I miss them.

01:39:45.936 --> 01:39:48.112
Remind me why
we ever left Connecticut.

01:39:48.286 --> 01:39:50.593
[chuckling]
Because you wanted to move.[blusters, whinnies]

01:39:50.767 --> 01:39:53.988
My pony!
- [laughing] What?
- Oh, my God.

01:39:54.162 --> 01:39:55.641
I got my fricking pony!

01:39:55.815 --> 01:39:58.296
Oh, my God, Bill.

01:39:59.123 --> 01:40:01.647
- Oh, my.
- Bill.

01:40:01.821 --> 01:40:03.475
Thank you, sweetie.

01:40:03.649 --> 01:40:05.390
Me? I...

01:40:05.564 --> 01:40:07.740
Oh, okay. All right.
Well, I should be the one
thanking you.

01:40:07.914 --> 01:40:10.352
Why didn'’t you tell me
you found the tree topper?

01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:12.745
I-I didn'’t find it.

01:40:12.919 --> 01:40:15.357
Okay, yeah, right.
As if I believe you.

01:40:18.751 --> 01:40:20.231
Yeah. Okay. You...

01:40:23.626 --> 01:40:24.844
Best Christmas ever.

01:40:25.019 --> 01:40:27.412

[line ringing]

01:40:34.767 --> 01:40:37.161
- [Bill] It'’s fine. All right?
- Yeah. I think so.

01:40:37.335 --> 01:40:38.902
Hey, Gibby. Merry Christmas.

01:40:39.076 --> 01:40:40.860
[Gibby] <i>Yeah. Yeah. You too.</i>

01:40:41.035 --> 01:40:45.561
So, did it kick in yet,
you being with team Satan now?

01:40:45.735 --> 01:40:47.519
No. Long story.

01:40:47.693 --> 01:40:49.391
But everything turned out great.

01:40:49.565 --> 01:40:50.783
And I got my soul back.

01:40:50.957 --> 01:40:52.655
Wow.

01:40:52.829 --> 01:40:53.960
Guess what.

01:40:54.135 --> 01:40:56.702
Things are about to
get even better.

01:40:56.876 --> 01:40:59.357
'’Cause I just convinced Emma
to give you another chance.

01:40:59.531 --> 01:41:01.881
Wait. Really?
How? What did you say?

01:41:02.056 --> 01:41:05.363
Well, I know she'’s into
the whole sympathy thing,

01:41:05.537 --> 01:41:07.583
so I told her about
your dead brother.

01:41:10.238 --> 01:41:11.674
Uh-oh.

01:41:22.337 --> 01:41:24.078

01:41:42.574 --> 01:41:44.098

01:42:59.173 --> 01:43:01.349
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho!

01:45:05.995 --> 01:45:07.170
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

01:45:07.344 --> 01:45:08.998
Hold up.

01:45:09.172 --> 01:45:11.609
Slow down, Lance Armstrong.

01:45:11.783 --> 01:45:14.743
Oh, I do apologize.
I didn'’t realize
there were any cars coming.

01:45:14.917 --> 01:45:17.659
Yeah. I'’ll tell you
when there'’s no cars.

01:45:17.833 --> 01:45:19.269
Oh, my.

01:45:23.055 --> 01:45:28.322
I must say,
I appreciate a woman who is
keen to her professional duties.

01:45:28.496 --> 01:45:31.237
Now, may I be so bold
as to ask...

01:45:31.412 --> 01:45:33.414
Yes?

01:45:33.588 --> 01:45:35.633
What is it
you'’re doing here today?

01:45:35.807 --> 01:45:38.114
I mean, do they have you
working on Christmas Day?

01:45:38.288 --> 01:45:39.463
Oh.

01:45:39.637 --> 01:45:41.944
No, I sorta
just showed up.

01:45:42.118 --> 01:45:43.902
Didn'’t have
anything else going on.

01:45:44.076 --> 01:45:48.037
I actually had
nothing going on either,
so I... I don'’t know.

01:45:48.211 --> 01:45:50.909
I thought I'’d just
go for a bike ride.[gasps]

01:45:52.346 --> 01:45:53.608
- Uh, please, go ahead.
- Right.

01:45:53.782 --> 01:45:54.783
Yeah.[chuckles]

01:45:54.957 --> 01:45:56.872
You wouldn'’t,
by chance, uh,

01:45:57.046 --> 01:46:01.224
be interested in heading over
to the Royal Garden perhaps?

01:46:01.398 --> 01:46:03.095
Eating some Chinese food.

01:46:03.269 --> 01:46:04.662
Maybe watching some hoops.

01:46:04.836 --> 01:46:06.838
I think they have
the best crab rangoons in town.

01:46:08.318 --> 01:46:10.538
But of course--
I don'’t mean to put you out.

01:46:12.017 --> 01:46:13.497
You had me at "rangoons."

01:46:13.671 --> 01:46:15.064
Then it'’s a date.

01:46:15.238 --> 01:46:16.587
Hop on, milady.

01:46:17.893 --> 01:46:21.679
Second thought, uh,
how about we take a brisk walk?

01:46:21.853 --> 01:46:22.680
Oh.[chuckles]

01:46:22.854 --> 01:46:24.029
Shall I?Yeah.

01:46:24.203 --> 01:46:25.944
- Let'’s shove off.
- Let'’s shove off.

01:46:26.118 --> 01:46:27.816
You must be from England.
Are you?

01:46:27.990 --> 01:46:30.688
Jersey.
New Jersey, actually. Yes.

01:46:30.862 --> 01:46:32.342
The Princeton area of course.

01:46:32.516 --> 01:46:33.996
[crossing guard]
That explains the accent.

01:46:34.170 --> 01:46:35.432
[Mr. Charles]
Yes. Yes, yes.

01:46:35.606 --> 01:46:36.999
[both laughing]
