WEBVTT

01:16.776 --> 01:18.278
[crackling]

01:46.906 --> 01:48.241
[wind blowing]

01:54.314 --> 01:55.748
[Holly laughing] Whoo!

01:57.617 --> 02:00.587
[Holly shouting indistinctly]

02:06.092 --> 02:07.594
[laughs]

02:13.133 --> 02:14.434
[coughing]

02:18.938 --> 02:20.106
[gagging]

02:23.810 --> 02:25.612
[panting]

02:30.183 --> 02:31.317
[gasping]

02:52.839 --> 02:55.341
Little Victor Stone.
[exhales]

02:55.408 --> 02:58.845
The last time I saw you,
you were about this tall.

02:58.912 --> 03:00.914
Sitting in the corner of
Elinore's office,

03:01.014 --> 03:04.017
playing quietly with
your Superman doll.

03:04.083 --> 03:06.252
-You probably don't
remember me.
-That was a lifetime ago.

03:06.352 --> 03:09.989
Yeah, I worked with your mom
at S.T.A.R. for years.

03:10.056 --> 03:12.592
She was an incredible woman.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.327
Why'd you leave?

03:14.394 --> 03:17.397
Well, after 9/11,
S.T.A.R. doubled down
on weapons programs.

03:17.497 --> 03:21.034
-I wanted to heal people,
not arm them.
-Hmm.

03:21.100 --> 03:26.873
It's a shame how many of
my clients were disfigured by
S.T.A.R.-developed weapons.

03:26.940 --> 03:29.442
So, what can I do for you, Vic?

03:29.542 --> 03:31.678
I heard about synthetic skin,

03:31.744 --> 03:35.882
and I wonder if that might be
an option for me.

03:35.949 --> 03:39.385
Well, that's definitely not
what I expected you to say.

03:40.620 --> 03:42.555
-But may I?
-Of course.

03:44.891 --> 03:47.360
I have to admit...

03:47.427 --> 03:51.564
I was surprised when Silas
chose the Cyborg tech for you,

03:51.631 --> 03:53.866
instead of coming to me.

03:53.933 --> 03:56.869
I mean, you were just
such a happy kid.

03:58.238 --> 04:02.742
My God, Silas really is
a magician, isn't he?

04:02.809 --> 04:06.980
I mean, an internal
battery-powered
mechanokinetic

04:07.080 --> 04:08.648
pulse cannon. I...

04:08.748 --> 04:10.049
What's the total output?

04:10.116 --> 04:10.984
10,000 volts?

04:11.084 --> 04:12.819
-25.
-Whoa.

04:12.919 --> 04:14.787
Yeah, I can liquify
an armored truck in
under three seconds.

04:14.887 --> 04:16.489
[chuckles] Wow.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.491
Well...

04:18.591 --> 04:19.959
Okay.

04:20.059 --> 04:23.296
Unsurprisingly,
the physiological integration

04:23.396 --> 04:25.665
of your tech
is incredibly extensive.

04:25.765 --> 04:29.068
To safely introduce
a SynthSkin exodermis,

04:29.135 --> 04:32.071
your Cyborg tech would have
to be completely removed.

04:32.138 --> 04:33.239
Even Grid?

04:33.306 --> 04:34.774
Obviously,
your artificial organs

04:34.841 --> 04:36.843
and structural prosthetics
would have to stay,

04:36.943 --> 04:41.447
but anything that requires
more energy than you get
from a burrito? Gotta go.

04:49.188 --> 04:50.456
What if I wanted to do it?

04:52.125 --> 04:53.459
How soon could you...

04:54.661 --> 04:56.362
Good news there.

04:56.462 --> 04:59.832
Your biotech interfaces
are almost entirely
nanotechnological,

04:59.932 --> 05:03.436
which makes extraction
largely a matter of code.

05:03.503 --> 05:05.538
So, this could be
an overnight procedure.

05:06.839 --> 05:10.710
But this isn't a decision
you should take lightly.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.279
Have you talked
with your father about this?

05:15.715 --> 05:17.183
[exhales]

05:19.652 --> 05:21.454
My mom
would want this for me.

05:23.022 --> 05:24.524
That's the only thing
I care about.

05:25.858 --> 05:26.893
That's fair.

05:28.127 --> 05:29.028
I just...

05:29.996 --> 05:31.664
[sighs]

05:31.731 --> 05:37.170
We urge all of our clients
to talk this through
with a loved one.

05:37.236 --> 05:40.907
Believe me, this will be
a lot easier with someone
by your side.

05:43.509 --> 05:45.144
[Jane] My fucking records?

05:46.012 --> 05:47.313
Which ones?

05:47.380 --> 05:51.517
Uh, well, I sold them as a lot.
So, all of them?

05:51.584 --> 05:54.420
-What the fuck
is wrong with you?
-You don't understand.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.023
They had a special edition
<i>Chipmunk Master</i> keychain

05:57.090 --> 05:59.559
you could get for just
15,000 acorns

05:59.659 --> 06:01.494
and I was almost there

06:01.561 --> 06:04.931
when I lost it all
on a double-or-nothing Nut Jump
against Mr. Fox

06:05.031 --> 06:08.434
even though Ginger told me
not to trust Mr. Fox!

06:09.736 --> 06:11.003
Huh?

06:11.070 --> 06:12.338
[Cliff] What?

06:12.405 --> 06:14.173
There's something weird
going on with you.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.376
No, there isn't.
There's something weird
going on with you.

06:16.442 --> 06:19.946
After you get my fucking
records back, you're gonna--

06:20.046 --> 06:20.880
[choking]

06:21.547 --> 06:22.515
Jane?

06:23.583 --> 06:25.885
Oh, fuck. I got this.

06:25.952 --> 06:28.454
I took a Heimlich
course in '87.

06:28.554 --> 06:33.025
Had to bone the instructor
to pass but I remember
the basics.

06:33.092 --> 06:34.894
[choking continues]

06:36.629 --> 06:37.764
[Cliff] What the fuck?

06:39.065 --> 06:40.533
[groaning]

06:40.600 --> 06:41.901
[gasps]

06:41.968 --> 06:43.736
Oh, you got the prize!

06:44.570 --> 06:45.805
[exhales]

06:45.905 --> 06:47.974
[Jane] It's those Dada freaks.

06:48.074 --> 06:49.475
[object shatters]

06:49.575 --> 06:51.544
-What the fuck?
-[gasps]

06:51.611 --> 06:53.880
[Cliff] Holy shit on a shingle.

06:53.946 --> 06:55.648
There is something
weird going on.

06:55.748 --> 06:57.784
[Madame Rouge] Of course
there's something going on,

06:57.884 --> 07:01.487
you guileless golem.
They are coming for us.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.890
We must rally
to defend the castle.

07:03.956 --> 07:05.925
Cliff, seal the doors,
the windows

07:05.992 --> 07:08.561
and the motherfucking
fireplaces.

07:08.628 --> 07:11.831
Why are you even still here?
We had a deal.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.734
We did your little spy mission.
Now, why don't you
get the fuck out

07:14.801 --> 07:18.337
and take your dumb quirks
and your fucking stupid
magic tricks with you.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.439
Yeah.

07:19.505 --> 07:20.673
Yeah,
we have bigger problems--

07:20.773 --> 07:22.842
You have bigger problems.
Not us.

07:22.942 --> 07:27.346
I assure you that this
is everyone's problem.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.582
Look, Curly.
When something wants to get us,

07:29.649 --> 07:31.684
it usually finds
a way to get us.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.419
-No use trying to stop it.
-[scoffs]

07:33.486 --> 07:35.154
Now you, get your laptop.

07:35.254 --> 07:37.123
We're getting
my records back, you fuck.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.825
-What's the big deal?
-[groans]

07:38.925 --> 07:40.359
They weren't even
worth that much.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.261
[Madame Rouge]
We've got to seal
these windows.

07:42.328 --> 07:45.465
Now, your Cher workout tapes,
on the other hand... [chuckles]

07:46.165 --> 07:47.300
My what?

07:47.366 --> 07:49.435
-Um...
-Oh, no, you didn't.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.639
You sold my Cher workout tapes?

07:53.706 --> 07:55.508
[sputtering]
Let me explain.

07:56.609 --> 07:57.710
Um...

08:00.713 --> 08:02.982
-[Cliff] What? No.
-[doorbell ringing]

08:03.049 --> 08:06.152
Wait, no, no,
I'm still not-- Flit!

08:06.219 --> 08:07.553
Shit, shit.

08:07.653 --> 08:11.958
-Dad, what are you doing here?
-Uh...

08:12.024 --> 08:16.963
Hey, here I am.
Surprise extended
Grandpa visit.

08:17.029 --> 08:18.564
-Whoo-hoo!
-Hey.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.167
-Did you get help with your--
-Oh, the Parkie?

08:21.234 --> 08:23.169
Yeah, that's all taken care of.

08:23.236 --> 08:26.572
Got some pills. And let me
tell you, those babies work
like gangbusters.

08:27.073 --> 08:28.140
See?

08:28.908 --> 08:31.143
Steady as a rock.

08:32.979 --> 08:33.880
Good.

08:36.883 --> 08:39.318
I... I've been eyeing
the Bureau

08:39.385 --> 08:42.555
since my cousin Paige
came on here.

08:42.655 --> 08:45.224
He's... he's a meta, too.

08:46.559 --> 08:49.262
Worked in comms
until the Big One.

08:50.563 --> 08:51.697
Did you know him?

08:54.267 --> 08:58.771
Anyway, Paige didn't
make it back fully intact.

08:58.871 --> 09:03.042
So, I figured I'd wait for
the war to be good and over.

09:03.109 --> 09:06.112
The war is never over.

09:06.212 --> 09:09.215
So tell me, who are you?

09:09.282 --> 09:11.684
Who am I? I'm, uh...

09:11.751 --> 09:14.887
I'm... I'm Wally Sage, ma'am.
I just told you--

09:14.954 --> 09:16.789
What are you?

09:20.893 --> 09:24.463
Ah, I see. A test.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.366
Very sneaky, ma'am.

09:27.433 --> 09:31.137
-Uh... What am I, huh?
-[door opens]

09:31.237 --> 09:32.872
Um...

09:32.939 --> 09:37.476
Well, I guess, probably...
I don't know
what you'd call it.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.612
Probably easier
if I just show you.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.229
Hmm.

09:59.599 --> 10:00.566
Fascinating.

10:03.436 --> 10:09.175
Can you apply this ability
to, say... artillery?

10:09.275 --> 10:13.179
Uh, sure, I guess. But...

10:14.914 --> 10:17.483
I came in to see about
the marketing position.

10:17.583 --> 10:20.353
Well, you will be very useful.

10:23.456 --> 10:24.490
Weapon.

10:28.861 --> 10:29.762
Thank you.

10:39.205 --> 10:40.139
Laura...

10:41.340 --> 10:42.875
he was just a boy.

10:42.975 --> 10:46.012
Wars don't fight themselves.

10:46.112 --> 10:49.882
Is that all you have to say?
You used to look out
for kids like him.

10:49.982 --> 10:54.887
Well, it's not the same
carefree world it was then,
is it?

10:54.987 --> 10:59.458
We must make difficult
choices in order to keep
our country safe.

11:03.562 --> 11:07.900
We're meeting at the Salon
tonight to workshop
a new piece.

11:08.901 --> 11:10.803
We'd all love to see you.

11:10.870 --> 11:12.705
-"We all"?
-Yes.

11:12.805 --> 11:15.341
Holly, Malcolm, everyone.

11:15.408 --> 11:16.375
We miss you.

11:17.343 --> 11:21.480
Don't you miss making art

11:21.547 --> 11:24.650
and expressing yourself?
You used to say
that it was your calling.

11:24.717 --> 11:26.752
Well, I have
a higher calling now.

11:26.852 --> 11:30.423
Yeah, I recall you
landing here with a calling.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.325
Something about a time machine.

11:33.392 --> 11:36.829
But you gave up on all that
when you found safety
in your little...

11:37.697 --> 11:39.832
coterie, didn't you?

11:40.866 --> 11:41.934
Laura...

11:43.335 --> 11:45.404
it's your coterie, too.

11:45.504 --> 11:50.509
I swear, if the Bureau could,
they'd make us forget that
we all had lives before--

11:50.576 --> 11:52.078
Yes, well, don't worry.

11:52.178 --> 11:54.013
I'll never forget.

11:54.080 --> 11:58.017
Now send in the next recruit,
would you, on your way out?

12:00.586 --> 12:01.787
[opens drawer]

12:23.442 --> 12:24.944
[exhales deeply]

12:34.253 --> 12:36.388
Mm, let me guess. She said no.

12:37.456 --> 12:39.658
You surprised?

12:39.759 --> 12:42.762
I'm a little worried about her,
if I'm being honest.

12:42.828 --> 12:47.166
-Lately, she's just seems so--
-Sour? Hmm.

12:47.266 --> 12:50.302
-She's been sour for 15 years.
-It's her job.

12:50.402 --> 12:53.339
That sort of work
just has to weigh
on a person's soul.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.574
-Yeah, if she still has one.
-Malcolm.

12:55.641 --> 12:58.978
She saved all of our souls
once upon a time.

12:59.078 --> 13:01.313
Maybe it's our turn
to save hers.

13:03.649 --> 13:05.684
Hmm.

13:05.785 --> 13:06.752
Maybe you're right.

13:50.129 --> 13:51.463
[knocking on door]

13:51.530 --> 13:52.531
[Larry groans]

13:52.631 --> 13:54.200
Larry?

13:54.300 --> 13:55.534
-[groans]
-[knocking on door]

13:55.634 --> 13:57.002
-[Madame Rouge] Larry?
-[Larry] God.

13:57.069 --> 13:59.138
[Madame Rouge]
It is 11:00 in the morning

13:59.205 --> 14:02.308
and you're loafing about
on the floor.

14:02.374 --> 14:04.343
[Madame Rouge scoffs]

14:04.410 --> 14:07.580
My expectations with you people
truly could not be any lower
at this point.

14:07.680 --> 14:10.916
But we are about to be
confronted by an inconceivably
dangerous threat.

14:11.016 --> 14:14.553
-[gasps]
-And I need all
the help I can get.

14:14.653 --> 14:18.524
Uh, fine. Fine.
Could you just...
Can you give me a minute?

14:18.591 --> 14:19.658
God.

14:19.725 --> 14:21.660
Um... what on earth is that?

14:21.727 --> 14:27.733
[Larry] It's just...
Well, it started as a tumor,
but then it, uh...

14:27.833 --> 14:31.403
-That came out of you?
-Yes.

14:31.503 --> 14:34.506
-Out of your--
-Out of my mouth, okay?

14:41.213 --> 14:43.716
Yes. It's definitely alive.

14:43.782 --> 14:46.952
[Madame Rouge]
Wow. A sentient tumor.
Fascinating.

14:47.052 --> 14:50.389
Have you recently been exposed
to any abnormal atmospheres?

14:50.456 --> 14:53.392
[Larry] My entire life is
an abnormal atmosphere.

14:53.459 --> 14:56.695
Do you mean the Afterlife?
The Negative Nebula?

14:56.762 --> 14:59.198
I went to Costco for
the first time a few weeks ago.

14:59.265 --> 15:00.799
-Was that it?
-No, the second one.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.736
This Nebula. I think
that's your answer right there.

15:03.802 --> 15:07.640
I mean, you're probably
dealing with some kind
of space parasite.

15:07.740 --> 15:08.874
[Larry] Really?

15:08.941 --> 15:10.209
How can you be sure?

15:10.276 --> 15:11.744
Well, what else could it be,
you bampot?

15:11.810 --> 15:15.314
[Larry] Okay. Okay.
Well, what should I do?

15:15.414 --> 15:18.417
Oh, well,
let's use our brains here.

15:18.484 --> 15:21.387
When one expels a living,

15:21.453 --> 15:24.823
16-pound parasite
from one's body,

15:24.924 --> 15:27.960
there is really only one
reasonable response.

15:31.230 --> 15:34.066
-Give it a name?
-Jesus Christ almighty, no.

15:34.133 --> 15:37.770
No, burn... Burn it. Burn it.

15:37.836 --> 15:40.306
And meet me in the great room
when you've dealt with it.

15:40.406 --> 15:42.508
Jesus Christ! You burn it.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.476
You don't give it
a fucking name.

15:48.914 --> 15:50.082
[Kay crying]

15:56.188 --> 15:57.122
What's wrong, Kay?

15:59.491 --> 16:01.593
Driller Bill says
you've been crying all day.

16:05.264 --> 16:06.165
Someone...

16:07.199 --> 16:09.468
Someone stole my bike.

16:09.535 --> 16:13.372
It was right outside my door
when I went to bed
and when I woke up,

16:13.472 --> 16:15.007
it was gone.

16:15.107 --> 16:16.508
Okay, well,

16:16.608 --> 16:18.310
maybe somebody
just borrowed it.
Did you ask--

16:18.377 --> 16:19.545
They stole it!

16:19.645 --> 16:22.314
Stop treating me
like I'm a stupid baby.

16:24.383 --> 16:25.784
Okay.

16:25.851 --> 16:28.787
Well, we'll just go up top
and get you a new bike.

16:28.854 --> 16:30.356
And this time
we'll actually pay for it.

16:30.456 --> 16:34.693
No, I don't wanna go up.
I never wanna go up again.

16:35.861 --> 16:37.363
[continues crying]

16:43.035 --> 16:44.236
[Rory cooing]

16:44.336 --> 16:46.839
I don't know
if it's your ice-cold touch

16:46.905 --> 16:48.407
or the hum
of your nutrient tank,

16:48.507 --> 16:51.410
but he is never as relaxed
as when he's with you.

16:51.510 --> 16:54.747
That's my grandpa
powers at work.

16:54.847 --> 16:58.017
You remind me more and more
of Grandpa RJ, you know that?

16:58.083 --> 17:00.085
[Cliff groans]

17:00.185 --> 17:03.222
You know what?
You guys deserve a real break.

17:03.322 --> 17:07.092
Why don't I watch Rory
so you can go out?
Date night.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.695
Out? I don't even know
what that means anymore.

17:14.600 --> 17:17.202
Thanks, but we're good.

17:17.269 --> 17:20.105
You know,
that sounds nice actually.

17:20.205 --> 17:21.940
Are you serious?

17:22.040 --> 17:24.076
Yeah. We'll just walk down
to Scooter Dog's,
grab an ice cream bar.

17:24.176 --> 17:26.011
We'll be gone 20 minutes.
30, tops.

17:26.078 --> 17:29.081
You won't regret this.
I'm gonna have the whole
place cleaned up and--

17:29.181 --> 17:31.417
-Here. Just in case,
for emergencies.
-[Cliff] Uh...

17:32.284 --> 17:34.353
Okay, cool.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.472
[Holly humming]

17:53.572 --> 17:54.807
[machine whirring]

18:03.916 --> 18:04.817
[grunts]

18:04.917 --> 18:06.118
[continues humming]

18:22.935 --> 18:24.269
[foghorn bellowing]

18:30.476 --> 18:31.944
[birds chirping]

18:38.517 --> 18:39.518
[exhales]

18:41.787 --> 18:43.122
[Larry] I guess that's that.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.094
[exhales]

18:49.161 --> 18:52.197
Next time you go to space,
don't forget to wear
a spacesuit, Larry.

18:52.297 --> 18:53.765
[chuckles]

18:55.334 --> 18:56.468
Oh.

18:59.872 --> 19:00.706
[exhales]

19:01.974 --> 19:02.808
Damn it.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.612
Damn, damn, damn.

19:06.678 --> 19:09.014
Hey. Hey,
you all right in there?

19:09.114 --> 19:12.017
I couldn't just leave you
out here without giving
you a fighting chance.

19:12.117 --> 19:13.318
I went back
and made you a...

19:13.385 --> 19:15.320
I don't know what
space parasites eat,

19:15.387 --> 19:17.890
but I figure everybody
likes a PB&J.

19:21.660 --> 19:22.661
Here you go.

19:29.334 --> 19:30.369
[sighs]

19:32.671 --> 19:34.139
What the hell
is wrong with me?

19:37.509 --> 19:40.746
Here. It's supposed to get
pretty chilly tonight.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.915
Hey, look, there's nothing
to be afraid of.

19:43.015 --> 19:43.882
[rustling nearby]

19:44.550 --> 19:45.517
I don't think.

19:48.086 --> 19:48.921
[groans]

19:53.358 --> 19:54.393
[sighs]

19:55.894 --> 19:58.530
Look, I don't know
what you want,

20:00.232 --> 20:03.902
but you're better off
without me.
Just trust me on that.

20:04.002 --> 20:05.337
[foghorn bellowing
in distance]

20:08.440 --> 20:09.374
[Larry] Huh.

20:10.375 --> 20:11.410
That can't be good.

20:12.444 --> 20:13.946
[bellowing continues]

20:23.222 --> 20:24.523
[bird screeching in distance]

20:32.898 --> 20:33.932
[rhythmic beeping]

20:36.768 --> 20:40.806
I... S... S...

20:40.906 --> 20:42.908
M... E...

20:44.042 --> 20:44.876
"Miss..."

20:45.711 --> 20:46.612
"Miss me"?

20:56.321 --> 20:57.923
How the hell did you find me?

20:57.990 --> 20:59.758
[Vic]<i> The super computer</i>
<i>in my head helped a little.</i>

21:01.660 --> 21:03.161
And what do you

21:03.262 --> 21:04.997
<i>and the super computer</i>
<i>in your head want?</i>

21:05.097 --> 21:07.833
I just wanted you to know,
you were right.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.303
-[Roni]<i> About what?</i>
-About me.

21:12.738 --> 21:15.741
Look, everything's always been
so laid out for me.

21:15.807 --> 21:17.142
I didn't even know
what was missing.

21:18.310 --> 21:20.345
But I do now.

21:20.445 --> 21:23.348
<i>It's like, how can I help</i>
<i>people when there's this</i>
<i>barrier between us?</i>

21:23.448 --> 21:25.183
<i>When they can't even relate</i>
<i>to me as a human being?</i>

21:25.284 --> 21:26.785
You're rambling, Vic.

21:26.852 --> 21:28.353
What you trying to do?
Keep me on the line long enough

21:28.453 --> 21:29.855
for your S.T.A.R. buddies
to come scoop me up?

21:29.955 --> 21:32.758
No, no, you won't have to
worry about that anymore.

21:36.962 --> 21:37.963
What's going on, Vic?

21:40.132 --> 21:42.701
[sighs] I think I might
have it taken out.

21:45.103 --> 21:46.038
My tech.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.707
<i>-All of it.</i>
-What?

21:48.807 --> 21:50.976
Look, I just wanted you to know
because you were the one who--

21:51.043 --> 21:52.044
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

21:52.144 --> 21:53.145
What...

21:55.180 --> 21:56.948
What happened to
wanting to be a hero?

21:57.015 --> 21:59.718
But my tech
doesn't make me a hero.

21:59.818 --> 22:01.787
Having an energy cannon fused
to my nervous system--

22:01.853 --> 22:05.057
<i>That's not what I meant.</i>
<i>We have our preferred methods,</i>

22:05.157 --> 22:08.060
but at the end of the day,
we want the same thing.

22:08.160 --> 22:09.795
Change.

22:09.861 --> 22:11.963
<i>Now, I'm blasting through</i>
<i>the back door demanding it</i>

22:12.030 --> 22:15.233
while you're walking into
the lobby with a big,
dumb smile on your face,

22:15.334 --> 22:16.735
talking about...

22:16.835 --> 22:18.737
[in comical voice]
"Hi, I'm Cyborg.
Nice to meet ya."

22:18.837 --> 22:23.342
[in normal voice]<i> But sometimes</i>
<i>change comes from the inside.</i>

22:23.408 --> 22:26.578
-You taught me that.
<i>-I'm not giving up the fight.</i>

22:26.678 --> 22:28.213
I'll just have to find
another way.

22:28.313 --> 22:29.981
<i>You already have a way, Vic.</i>

22:30.048 --> 22:32.250
You can sign all the online
petitions that you want,

22:32.351 --> 22:35.087
but when there is a guy
with an arm cannon
at the table,

22:35.187 --> 22:36.988
you're going to want to listen
to what he has to say.

22:37.055 --> 22:40.025
Wait. How is that
any different than a cop

22:40.092 --> 22:42.494
demanding obedience
down the barrel of a gun?

22:42.561 --> 22:45.030
<i>Because we don't</i>
<i>want obedience.</i>

22:45.097 --> 22:46.665
All we want is justice.

22:48.100 --> 22:50.068
I didn't ask for this, Roni.

22:50.168 --> 22:52.671
[Roni]<i> None of us asked</i>
<i>for what we got.</i>

22:52.738 --> 22:56.675
Only thing that matters
is what we do once we got it.

22:58.043 --> 23:00.112
But Cyborg isn't me.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.847
I'm not happy like this.

23:01.913 --> 23:06.585
Yeah, well, not all of us
can afford to prioritize
our happiness.

23:06.685 --> 23:12.758
The fact is, you're a more
effective agent of change
as Cyborg than you are as Vic.

23:12.858 --> 23:13.959
<i>So what do you want?</i>

23:14.059 --> 23:14.960
<i>Change?</i>

23:15.060 --> 23:16.128
<i>Or do you want to happiness?</i>

23:16.228 --> 23:17.429
But you taught me
to trust myself,

23:17.529 --> 23:18.930
and that's exactly
what I'm doing.

23:20.966 --> 23:22.567
I thought you'd be happy
for me.

23:26.371 --> 23:27.606
[electric static]

23:27.706 --> 23:28.607
Roni?

23:29.574 --> 23:30.876
<i>-You there?</i>
-Vic.

23:31.910 --> 23:32.978
I'm losing you.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.947
<i>It's not safe to talk anyway.</i>

23:36.615 --> 23:37.549
<i>Just...</i>

23:38.450 --> 23:39.618
Do what you gotta do.

23:42.487 --> 23:44.089
<i>And maybe I'll see you</i>
<i>on the other side.</i>

23:46.758 --> 23:48.226
-[dishes clattering]
-[Rory crying]

23:48.293 --> 23:50.262
[Cliff] All good. All good.
Everything's fine.

23:50.328 --> 23:52.798
[man on radio]
<i>We have multiple reports</i>
<i>of an unprecedented fog</i>

23:52.898 --> 23:54.633
<i>spreading over</i>
<i>the Eastern Seaboard.</i>

23:54.733 --> 23:56.668
<i>In my 23 years</i>
<i>on the weather map,</i>

23:56.768 --> 23:58.470
<i>I've never seen anything</i>
<i>like this--</i>

23:58.570 --> 24:02.240
Nope! No negativity today!
This is what I'm talking about.

24:02.307 --> 24:05.343
Grandpa and Rory
just hanging out,

24:05.444 --> 24:08.013
making memories
that'll last a lifetime.

24:08.113 --> 24:10.849
Grandpa is not thinking
about anything at all.

24:14.186 --> 24:18.423
Not about Ginger,
not about Chipmunks.

24:19.658 --> 24:20.959
[smoke alarm beeping]

24:21.026 --> 24:22.627
-[Rory crying]
-Don't worry, buddy.

24:22.694 --> 24:23.962
Nothing your old g-pa
can't handle.

24:25.030 --> 24:26.531
Oh, fuck!

24:26.631 --> 24:28.133
Didn't think that through.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.701
-[Mel] Hey.
-[Clara] We're back.

24:29.801 --> 24:35.040
[Cliff] Oh, thank God...
I mean, oh, hey, back so soon?

24:35.140 --> 24:37.542
Cliff, the burner is on high.

24:37.642 --> 24:40.645
Oh, uh, I would have
caught that.

24:42.981 --> 24:47.118
Well, you did catch it.
So it's all good.

24:47.185 --> 24:50.121
It's fine. At least
you didn't burn the house down.

24:50.188 --> 24:53.225
See that? We're building trust.

24:53.325 --> 24:56.194
Yeah, I'm gonna put Rory down
for a nap.

25:01.199 --> 25:02.400
Hey, did you hear

25:02.501 --> 25:05.737
about this weird fog thing
rolling in?

25:05.837 --> 25:07.973
Is that something
we should be concerned about?

25:08.039 --> 25:11.076
Oh, that?
Don't even worry about it.

25:11.176 --> 25:13.578
Big Papa Cliff will keep
his family safe.

25:15.146 --> 25:16.715
Good.

25:16.815 --> 25:19.084
I don't want you
running off already.

25:19.184 --> 25:20.252
You just got here.

25:21.553 --> 25:22.554
[Cliff] Yeah.

25:24.089 --> 25:25.590
[objects clattering]

25:25.690 --> 25:29.261
[Jane] I'm gonna destroy
whatever thieving fuck took it.

25:29.361 --> 25:30.562
I'm talking murder.

25:31.863 --> 25:33.331
Who took the fucking bike, Doc?

25:33.398 --> 25:35.166
Whoever took it, I hope
they threw it in the well.

25:35.233 --> 25:36.401
I'm gonna fuck you up.

25:36.501 --> 25:38.370
They will have
done us all a favor.

25:38.436 --> 25:42.207
In case you haven't noticed,
Kay is staying put,

25:42.274 --> 25:43.508
right where she belongs.

25:43.575 --> 25:45.043
Because she's fucking
depressed,

25:45.110 --> 25:46.611
not because she wants to.

25:46.711 --> 25:48.780
I hate to point
the finger, Jane,

25:48.880 --> 25:50.916
but you've opened
this can of worms

25:51.016 --> 25:53.585
by allowing her to go up
in the first place.

25:53.685 --> 25:55.086
She was fine.

25:55.186 --> 25:58.056
She was lucky.
And if the girl's
going to be hurt,

25:58.123 --> 26:02.027
it's better it be on our terms
than on theirs.

26:02.093 --> 26:03.628
Don't you agree?

26:03.728 --> 26:06.631
We were created for one thing,
it was to protect the girl.

26:06.731 --> 26:08.133
If we can't even do that,
then maybe--

26:08.233 --> 26:11.469
Who's protecting us, Jane?

26:21.746 --> 26:22.814
[gasps]

26:30.922 --> 26:32.657
[Madame Rouge] Annihilation
is hot on my trail,

26:32.757 --> 26:33.992
but God forbid any of them

26:34.092 --> 26:35.961
should lift a finger to try
and help me.

26:36.061 --> 26:38.296
Why should I lure it away
from this temple of torpor?

26:38.396 --> 26:40.932
Because I am a good person,
that is why!

27:04.489 --> 27:07.659
[voice whispers]
<i>Tiptoe harem, purple and low.</i>

27:22.307 --> 27:23.174
[gasps softly]

27:24.809 --> 27:25.777
Fuck!

27:49.067 --> 27:50.135
[bicycle bell ringing]

27:50.201 --> 27:51.636
[ominous laughter]

27:51.703 --> 27:53.672
Show yourselves!

28:03.982 --> 28:05.650
[Hodges]
Burning the midnight oil?

28:07.852 --> 28:10.555
You know, if we had any sense,
we would be out celebrating.

28:10.655 --> 28:12.857
I heard we set a new
recruitment record this week.

28:12.924 --> 28:15.860
[Laura]
I set a recruitment record.

28:15.927 --> 28:17.829
Twelfth week in a row,
actually.

28:19.264 --> 28:20.732
Not bad, De Mille.

28:22.167 --> 28:23.568
If numbers were the only thing
that mattered,

28:23.668 --> 28:25.437
you'd be running
this joint by now.

28:25.537 --> 28:27.238
Pace yourself, Willy.

28:27.338 --> 28:30.942
Making enemies around here
won't advance you. Trust me.

28:31.843 --> 28:33.445
Wait.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.113
You don't think you have
what it takes

28:35.213 --> 28:37.549
to be a leader
in this organization, do you?

28:38.783 --> 28:41.853
Listen to me, you little hyena.

28:41.920 --> 28:45.290
I have been a loyal
and industrious part

28:45.390 --> 28:48.293
of the Bureau for 35 years
and I--

28:48.393 --> 28:49.894
What about your little pals?

28:50.628 --> 28:51.629
My little pals?

28:51.730 --> 28:53.565
In the mailroom.
The stretchy one,

28:53.631 --> 28:55.300
the living cyclone,
the invisible one.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.802
All very powerful or so I hear.

28:57.902 --> 28:59.204
And yet, every time

28:59.270 --> 29:01.306
the reclassification window
comes around,

29:01.406 --> 29:03.641
you decide to keep them
hidden in the basement.

29:03.742 --> 29:05.076
Yes, well, they're not--

29:05.143 --> 29:07.479
We are in the midst
of a meta-human arms race.

29:07.579 --> 29:08.913
And it seems to me
that you are more worried

29:08.980 --> 29:10.482
about protecting your friends

29:10.582 --> 29:14.753
than you are about protecting
what is actually at risk.

29:14.819 --> 29:17.489
The moral core
of our great nation.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.825
I do my job well

29:20.925 --> 29:24.162
and I do it
with acute moral integrity.

29:24.262 --> 29:27.932
And the meta-humans
in question
are simply unsuited for war.

29:29.601 --> 29:30.935
They're pacifists.

29:34.405 --> 29:36.074
And what does that make you?

29:43.615 --> 29:48.486
Those freaks are merely
an untapped resource.

29:48.586 --> 29:50.155
And depending on
who you ask...

29:51.956 --> 29:53.024
so are you.

29:54.993 --> 29:55.927
My advice?

29:57.662 --> 30:03.768
"Friend" is merely a nice word
for "opportunity."

30:05.270 --> 30:06.671
And don't think for a second

30:06.771 --> 30:08.973
that the big eye in the sky
isn't watching you.

30:17.148 --> 30:18.149
[screams in frustration]

30:29.661 --> 30:30.795
[sighs]

30:37.068 --> 30:39.170
[exotic music playing]

30:43.341 --> 30:47.478
[Rita] If we could have
your attention.

30:47.545 --> 30:50.215
Malcolm and I have been working
on something at home.

30:50.315 --> 30:53.918
We're not sure where
we're going with it,

30:54.018 --> 30:57.922
but perhaps it will help ignite
some creative juices, mm?

31:01.025 --> 31:04.696
Oh, I see.
You have his face

31:04.762 --> 31:08.166
and he has yours
because you're in love.

31:08.233 --> 31:09.934
-Please kill me now.
-[snickering]

31:10.034 --> 31:13.438
[Malcolm] Introducing
Skittish Apparition,

31:13.538 --> 31:16.875
and The Shapeless Shape.

31:18.276 --> 31:19.244
[Rita] Plastic!

31:19.911 --> 31:21.679
[Malcolm] Tundra!

31:21.746 --> 31:23.715
[both] Gullible
pickling carousel!

31:23.781 --> 31:25.383
[Rita laughing]

31:26.718 --> 31:27.719
[Malcolm] Ah...

31:27.785 --> 31:29.120
[both scatting]

31:39.063 --> 31:41.266
What the hell was that,
softshoe?

31:41.366 --> 31:42.867
Ah! Well...

31:42.934 --> 31:45.403
The newest thing
on Broadway.

31:45.470 --> 31:48.406
Our thinking was that
a playful subversion

31:48.473 --> 31:51.709
of cultural trends
could prove a fertile canvas

31:51.776 --> 31:54.545
in which to examine
human frivolity.

31:54.612 --> 31:55.613
[Malcolm] Mm-hmm.

31:56.781 --> 31:58.049
[in Japanese]

31:58.116 --> 31:59.817
[in English]
We're The Sisterhood of Dada.

32:00.885 --> 32:02.320
[in Japanese]

32:02.420 --> 32:03.588
[in English] We're artists.

32:05.323 --> 32:06.624
[in Japanese]

32:11.729 --> 32:13.131
[in English]
Oh, that's a little harsh.

32:13.231 --> 32:14.632
[in Japanese]

32:21.973 --> 32:22.840
[in English] Here we go.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.443
[in Japanese]

32:25.510 --> 32:27.679
[in English]
And every year
we vote against it.

32:27.779 --> 32:29.247
[in Japanese]

32:29.314 --> 32:31.416
[in English]
Because it's too dangerous.

32:33.284 --> 32:34.686
[in Japanese]

32:34.786 --> 32:36.454
[in English]
To make the world
a better place.

32:36.521 --> 32:37.455
[Lloyd scoffs]

32:42.760 --> 32:47.031
Since our inception,
there's been plague,

32:47.131 --> 32:49.968
depression, Holocaust.

32:50.034 --> 32:52.770
Just five years ago,
a world away,

32:52.837 --> 32:55.206
our bombs vaporized

32:55.306 --> 32:58.176
entire populations
where they stood.

32:58.276 --> 33:01.212
And right here,
in our backyard,

33:01.312 --> 33:05.116
my own people have been
subjected to horrors...

33:08.720 --> 33:10.955
you can't even...

33:11.022 --> 33:12.690
I can't even, man.
You know?

33:14.225 --> 33:16.160
How are we doing?

33:16.227 --> 33:19.831
We... Making the world
a better place.

33:23.134 --> 33:24.635
We stood by and watched

33:24.702 --> 33:27.405
the Bureau lurch from oddities
to normalcy,

33:27.505 --> 33:31.042
guided by the very same
ideologies we claim to oppose.

33:32.477 --> 33:35.246
We just kept our heads down.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.081
For what?

33:38.082 --> 33:39.183
A paycheck?

33:40.752 --> 33:44.055
There's a word for what we are.
All of us.

33:47.191 --> 33:48.192
Complicit.

33:57.535 --> 34:02.440
Well, if that's not motivation
to make a big statement,

34:03.741 --> 34:05.009
I don't know what is.

34:08.546 --> 34:14.685
As Nietzsche once said,
"it takes chaos inside of us

34:14.752 --> 34:16.954
to give birth
to the dancing star."

34:17.555 --> 34:18.756
Hmm?

34:18.856 --> 34:21.959
The Eternal Flagellation
would certainly be a big

34:22.060 --> 34:24.462
middle finger to the Bureau,
wouldn't it?

34:24.562 --> 34:25.963
But what about Laura?

34:26.063 --> 34:28.633
She'll never go along with it,
and we'll be forcing her

34:28.733 --> 34:30.902
to choose between us
and the Bureau.

34:30.968 --> 34:32.537
[in Japanese]

34:43.081 --> 34:44.916
[foghorn bellowing
in distance]

34:44.982 --> 34:46.417
[wind blowing]

34:50.221 --> 34:51.289
[Sachiko in Japanese]

34:57.962 --> 35:01.933
[Dr. Chalmers] All right.
You should start
to feel a little lightheaded.

35:01.999 --> 35:03.101
That's normal.

35:09.907 --> 35:11.175
Was that there before?

35:13.945 --> 35:15.446
[indistinct whispering]

35:21.018 --> 35:21.986
Hey.

35:26.757 --> 35:27.658
So...

35:30.161 --> 35:32.497
I found out what happened
to your bike.

35:32.597 --> 35:35.867
Turns out somebody
just wanted to borrow it
and they lost it.

35:35.967 --> 35:37.168
It was all a big mistake.

35:37.268 --> 35:38.836
Nothing to be upset about.

35:43.141 --> 35:45.276
We both know that's bullshit.

35:46.511 --> 35:47.812
[door slams]

35:48.779 --> 35:49.680
Kay?

35:52.650 --> 35:54.218
[Cliff] You should have
seen me, Ginger.

35:54.318 --> 35:59.290
Big Papa Cliff was Mr. Momming
the shit out of that kid.

35:59.357 --> 36:02.727
<i>Well, Big Papa,</i>
<i>you paid for 15 minutes.</i>

36:02.827 --> 36:05.997
<i>You wanna talk about parenting,</i>
<i>or you wanna see my hoo-hah?</i>

36:06.063 --> 36:09.000
Well... maybe just a little--

36:09.066 --> 36:11.469
Ow! Hey!

36:11.536 --> 36:13.204
[Dr. Chalmers] Vic! Oh, my God!
Are you okay?

36:13.304 --> 36:14.705
[Cliff] Fuck me!

36:14.805 --> 36:16.340
<i>Oh, my God, Cliffie,</i>
<i>is it the meds again?</i>

36:16.407 --> 36:18.075
<i>Do you want me</i>
<i>to call somebody?</i>

36:18.176 --> 36:20.711
[Cliff] No, don't call anybody.
It just needs to run its...

36:21.646 --> 36:22.880
course!

36:23.748 --> 36:25.082
[foghorn bellowing]

36:30.555 --> 36:31.689
[Cliff] Um...

36:32.557 --> 36:33.591
What the fuck?

36:34.325 --> 36:35.159
Whoa!

36:36.260 --> 36:38.062
Where the fuck are we?

36:38.162 --> 36:40.598
[Cliff] Welcome to, apparently,

36:40.698 --> 36:42.700
my drug-filled fantasy sequence
or some shit.

36:42.767 --> 36:43.701
[snickers]

36:43.768 --> 36:45.069
[Cliff and Vic laugh]

36:45.870 --> 36:47.872
Oh, my fucking God!

36:47.939 --> 36:51.209
I'm actually here with you
metal-poisoned morons.

36:51.275 --> 36:52.877
And I was in the middle
of something.

36:54.045 --> 36:55.213
Can't let any more in.

36:56.047 --> 36:58.516
Can't let the fog in.

36:58.583 --> 37:00.718
[Larry] Hey, what's up
with the foghorn?

37:00.785 --> 37:02.019
How did you get inside?

37:02.086 --> 37:04.222
What? I don't know.
The front door.

37:04.288 --> 37:06.757
Did you seal it?

37:06.857 --> 37:09.126
-[Larry] What? Why?
-[Madame Rouge] Why?

37:10.561 --> 37:11.596
[Larry] It's just a little--

37:12.396 --> 37:13.698
Fuck!

37:15.266 --> 37:17.401
[indistinct chatter]

37:28.713 --> 37:31.148
Laura, you came.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.450
[Malcolm] I'll be damned!

37:32.550 --> 37:33.985
[Shelly] Laura!

37:34.085 --> 37:36.587
Guess what!
We're doing it, Laura.

37:36.654 --> 37:40.124
We're finally doing
the Eternal Flagellation!

37:40.224 --> 37:41.158
Yes!

37:41.259 --> 37:43.227
[all cheering and laughing]

37:52.336 --> 37:53.437
Oh...

37:56.641 --> 37:58.743
[Larry grunts]

38:04.448 --> 38:07.952
[Larry] Um, can somebody
please tell me what
the hell is going on?

38:10.288 --> 38:11.989
I know this place.

38:12.089 --> 38:15.693
[Cliff] Is this Dada?
Are we doing Dada?

38:15.793 --> 38:17.428
-[Rita]<i> Laura...</i>
-[Malcolm]<i> I'll be damned.</i>

38:17.495 --> 38:18.696
How do I know this place?

38:18.796 --> 38:21.532
[Laura echoing]
<i>They're pacifists.</i>

38:21.632 --> 38:26.637
[Holly echoing]
<i>We're finally doing</i>
<i>the Eternal Flagellation.</i>

38:26.704 --> 38:29.674
I wanted you all to know
how proud I am of you.

38:31.509 --> 38:36.180
No matter how tough things got,
you stuck by each other.

38:39.016 --> 38:43.554
No matter how far I drifted
away from you,

38:43.654 --> 38:44.855
you kept me tethered.

38:47.558 --> 38:48.693
I'll never forget that.

38:48.793 --> 38:51.996
Don't apologize. Dance.

38:52.063 --> 38:56.867
[Cliff] This is really dumb
but we actually
look pretty cool.

38:56.967 --> 38:59.337
[Larry] Is this what you were
so scared of, De Mille?

38:59.403 --> 39:02.173
I've been to scarier dance
parties at church lock-ins.

39:02.239 --> 39:04.308
[Jane] God, that sounds
scary as fuck.

39:04.375 --> 39:06.177
No, no.

39:13.250 --> 39:14.085
No.

39:15.219 --> 39:16.687
[footsteps thudding]

39:18.522 --> 39:19.824
[gasps]

39:28.399 --> 39:33.371
No! No, there's no
need for force.
They won't fight back.

39:33.437 --> 39:35.940
[grunting]

39:41.379 --> 39:42.580
They won't fight back.

39:42.680 --> 39:43.781
They're pacifists.

39:44.682 --> 39:45.549
Please...

39:47.051 --> 39:48.052
Please!

39:50.588 --> 39:52.223
How'd you do this?

39:58.929 --> 40:00.064
Put them on their knees.

40:01.465 --> 40:02.299
[Larry] Ow!

40:02.400 --> 40:04.201
What the-- God.

40:04.268 --> 40:06.036
[Hodges]<i> Well done, De Mille.</i>

40:06.103 --> 40:08.739
I've been looking forward
to this for years.

40:08.806 --> 40:10.408
I'd like to personally
welcome you

40:10.474 --> 40:12.243
to the Bureau's
Meta Weapons Division.

40:13.577 --> 40:15.312
Finally promoted
out of the mail room.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.714
You should be proud.

40:16.781 --> 40:18.149
Go to hell.

40:18.249 --> 40:19.917
We will never fight for you.

40:22.953 --> 40:23.988
You're up, De Mille.

40:52.650 --> 41:02.960
Weapon.

41:04.428 --> 41:05.329
[breath shudders]

41:10.601 --> 41:11.502
Weapon.

41:11.602 --> 41:13.037
[Jane] Wait a fucking minute.

41:13.838 --> 41:15.272
Is this about you?

41:15.339 --> 41:16.707
Weapon.

41:16.807 --> 41:18.342
Is this like a flashback?

41:24.114 --> 41:25.115
Weapon.

41:26.784 --> 41:28.552
How could you do this to us?

41:29.687 --> 41:30.955
We were a family.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.225
Your...

41:35.526 --> 41:37.561
Your country needs you.

41:37.661 --> 41:40.397
So... on your knees, Bendy.

41:44.301 --> 41:45.903
On your knees, Bendy.

41:52.076 --> 41:52.977
[stun gun crackles]

41:53.043 --> 41:54.245
On your knees!

41:57.848 --> 41:59.884
[Malcolm] Laura, stop this.

42:07.391 --> 42:08.859
[crackling]

42:17.568 --> 42:18.736
[Rita]<i> Malcolm!</i>

42:19.870 --> 42:20.938
[Malcolm] Laura!

42:23.173 --> 42:24.341
[Malcolm groans]

42:47.131 --> 42:48.232
[crying]

43:15.459 --> 43:16.293
[groans]

43:35.446 --> 43:36.413
[Larry] Rita?

43:39.516 --> 43:40.618
She's ready.

43:43.153 --> 43:44.355
[Cliff] What the fuck!

43:44.455 --> 43:46.023
What's going on now?

43:46.123 --> 43:48.692
[Larry] Uh, I think we're
about to find out.

44:00.037 --> 44:01.805
[egg cracking]

44:09.813 --> 44:10.714
[growling]

44:20.157 --> 44:21.725
What the hell is that?

44:21.825 --> 44:24.328
[Rita] Laura,
you remember Malcolm?

44:25.496 --> 44:26.563
[gasps]

44:28.198 --> 44:30.200
You killed him.
Now you must set him free.

44:30.300 --> 44:34.838
I didn't kill anyone.
Everything I did, I had
a damn good reason to do.

44:34.905 --> 44:38.242
You told me the Sisterhood
of Dada was evil.

44:38.342 --> 44:40.878
-But the evil one was you.
-No!

44:42.146 --> 44:44.248
No, I am not evil.

44:44.348 --> 44:48.986
It's true, Laura. You did this
and we suffered for 70 years.

44:49.053 --> 44:51.422
Did unspeakable things
in service of a cause

44:51.522 --> 44:52.890
we abhorred because of you.

44:52.990 --> 44:54.925
You are wrong.

44:55.025 --> 44:57.995
The whole world
was crumbling around us,

44:58.062 --> 44:59.830
and all I cared about was you.

44:59.897 --> 45:03.767
But I made an oath
to the Bureau and I--

45:03.867 --> 45:05.235
[shrieking]

45:10.874 --> 45:14.211
We are offering you
a chance to atone. Take it!

45:21.919 --> 45:23.187
I atoned that day...

45:25.889 --> 45:28.092
by making useful agents of you.
