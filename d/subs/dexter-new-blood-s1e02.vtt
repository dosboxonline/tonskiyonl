- Thank you, everyone.</i>

00:59.934 --> 01:01.478
<i>My father protected me.</i>

01:01.519 --> 01:04.272
<i>And that's exactly what
I'm going to do for my son.</i>

01:17.869 --> 01:20.038
<i>What do I say?</i>

01:20.080 --> 01:23.249
<i>What can I possibly say

01:47.148 --> 01:48.483
<i>You hungry?</i>

01:49.484 --> 01:51.945
<i>I could whip up
some blueberry pancakes.</i>

01:51.986 --> 01:53.404
<i>You used to love those.</i>

01:54.155 --> 01:57.325
<i>Yeah, I'm not five anymore.</i>

02:00.245 --> 02:01.329

02:02.163 --> 02:04.374
<i>One sandwich, coming right up.</i>

02:30.024 --> 02:32.694
<i>Must've been a long trip.</i>

02:34.654 --> 02:36.072
<i>Yeah.</i>

02:46.875 --> 02:48.168
<i>Yeah, we got second place</i>

02:48.209 --> 02:50.295
<i>at the Harvest Fest Tournament
last year.</i>

02:52.338 --> 02:53.798
<i>Cool.</i>

03:14.736 --> 03:15.820
<i>So...</i>

03:18.698 --> 03:20.200
<i>You're not dead.</i>

03:20.241 --> 03:22.785
<i>He's owed an explanation.</i>

03:27.040 --> 03:29.834
<i>But the only one
is that his father is a monster.</i>

03:29.876 --> 03:31.211
<i>I'm sure this is hard.</i>

03:31.252 --> 03:32.337
<i>This?</i>

03:32.378 --> 03:33.504
<i>No.</i>

03:35.215 --> 03:39.219
<i>Growing up without a dad,
that was hard.</i>

03:40.094 --> 03:41.846
<i>And opening up that letter,</i>

03:41.888 --> 03:46.226
<i>finding out you let me believe
you were dead all those years...</i>

03:46.267 --> 03:48.394
<i>that was brutal.</i>

03:48.436 --> 03:50.939
<i>-Hannah showed you the letter?
- No.</i>

03:50.980 --> 03:53.191
<i>I found it when she died.</i>

03:53.233 --> 03:55.068
<i>Hannah died?</i>

03:57.111 --> 03:58.571
<i>How?</i>

03:58.613 --> 04:00.323
<i>Cancer.</i>

04:00.365 --> 04:02.283
<i>Pancreatic.</i>

04:08.748 --> 04:10.124
<i>I didn't know.</i>

04:10.917 --> 04:12.418
<i>When did she die?</i>

04:12.460 --> 04:13.753
<i>Three years ago.</i>

04:14.587 --> 04:15.588
<i>What happened to you?</i>

04:15.630 --> 04:17.006
<i>Where have you been?</i>

04:18.383 --> 04:20.260
<i>A social worker
put me on a plane</i>

04:20.301 --> 04:22.512
<i>from Buenos Aires to Miami.</i>

04:22.553 --> 04:26.516
<i>I bounced around a bunch
of shitty foster homes.</i>

04:26.557 --> 04:27.892
<i>No one wants a teenager.</i>

04:27.934 --> 04:31.020
<i>And finally I decided
to find you.</i>

04:33.481 --> 04:35.066
<i>Mm.</i>

04:35.108 --> 04:37.944
<i>The return address
got me that town in Oregon.</i>

04:37.986 --> 04:39.737
<i>And I found where you worked.</i>

04:39.779 --> 04:41.406
<i>Also found that you'd left.</i>

04:41.447 --> 04:43.908
<i>That's when it got
a little harder</i>

04:43.950 --> 04:46.202
<i>to track down Jim Lindsay.</i>

04:46.244 --> 04:48.955
<i>You know how many Jim Lindsays
there are on the Internet?</i>

04:48.997 --> 04:50.957
<i>It's kind of the point.</i>

04:50.999 --> 04:54.127
<i>Then I found
a shot of you on Instagram.</i>

04:54.168 --> 04:57.297
<i>Pictures don't lie.</i>

04:57.338 --> 04:59.465
<i>Some Fred guy

04:59.507 --> 05:02.510
<i>bragging on you bowling a 300.</i>

05:03.511 --> 05:05.179
<i>Right here in Iron Lake.</i>

05:07.932 --> 05:10.685
<i>So why all this Jim bullshit?</i>

05:10.727 --> 05:12.854
<i>What happened to Dexter Morgan?</i>

05:12.895 --> 05:14.439
<i>He killed dozens of people,</i>

05:14.480 --> 05:17.150
<i>got your mother
and your aunt killed, too.</i>

05:17.191 --> 05:19.986
<i>It's not who I am anymore.</i>

05:22.155 --> 05:24.115
<i>Dexter had to die.</i>

05:24.157 --> 05:26.159
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

05:26.868 --> 05:29.162
<i>It's a long story.</i>

05:32.040 --> 05:33.583
<i>We should get some rest,</i>

05:33.624 --> 05:35.626
<i>and I'll tell you everything
in the morning.</i>

05:35.668 --> 05:37.003
<i>I promise.</i>

05:38.338 --> 05:40.465
<i>Uh, you want my room?
I can take the couch.</i>

05:40.506 --> 05:41.799
<i>The couch is fine.</i>

05:41.841 --> 05:43.176
<i>Well, if you need
anything else...</i>

05:43.217 --> 05:44.927
<i>Where's the bathroom?</i>

06:26.386 --> 06:28.096
<i>Stop.</i>

06:29.430 --> 06:32.058
<i>-You're not listening!</i>

06:33.601 --> 06:35.061
<i>I need him here.</i>

06:35.103 --> 06:36.896
<i>It'll keep me
from killing again.</i>

06:39.190 --> 06:41.025
<i>You selfish psycho.</i>

06:42.443 --> 06:47.407
<i>You emotionally handicapped,
crazy fuck.</i>

06:47.448 --> 06:52.245
<i>If by some goddamn miracle
you don't end up killing him,</i>

06:52.286 --> 06:56.416
<i>you will sure as shit
fuck him up.</i>

07:18.563 --> 07:22.275
<i>slow, contemplative music</i>

to the daily routine.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.418
<i>This is what happens</i>

<i>Well, this is one storm of fuck.</i>

10:43.184 --> 10:46.520
<i>Matt Caldwell disappeared in
the woods near here last night.</i>

10:46.562 --> 10:47.647
<i>Oh.</i>

10:47.688 --> 10:49.148
<i>That's not good.</i>

10:49.190 --> 10:51.817
<i>Your place is close to
all the public hunting grounds,</i>

10:51.859 --> 10:55.863
<i>so I was hoping we could set up
base camp for the search here.</i>

10:55.905 --> 10:57.031
<i>Yeah. Of course.</i>

10:57.073 --> 10:59.492
<i>-Whatever you need.
- Don't worry, Jimmy.</i>

10:59.533 --> 11:01.577
<i>Dude probably got wasted
and skipped the hunt.</i>

11:01.619 --> 11:03.162
<i>We'll get a call he's
sleeping it off in some motel</i>

11:03.204 --> 11:04.622
<i>and be out of here by lunch.</i>

11:04.664 --> 11:05.665
<i>Or he could be out there,
freezing to death.</i>

11:05.706 --> 11:07.500
<i>You can set up by the firepit.</i>

11:07.541 --> 11:09.460
<i>The searchers can stay warm.</i>

11:09.502 --> 11:10.961
<i>I'll get some coffee going</i>

11:11.003 --> 11:12.421
<i>and breakfast, too, if you want.</i>

11:12.463 --> 11:14.006
You're a godsend.

<i>By the firepit, guys!</i>

11:15.549 --> 11:17.259
<i>Okay, guys!</i>

11:17.301 --> 11:18.844
<i>Let's unload the tables,
set up the tents.</i>

11:18.886 --> 11:20.346
<i>Let's move quickly!</i>

11:20.388 --> 11:22.515
<i>You mind if I use
your kitchen table for a sec?</i>

11:22.556 --> 11:25.726

<i>Son?</i>

11:45.204 --> 11:46.330
<i>Add that to the list</i>

<i>of things I need to clean up.</i>

11:47.748 --> 11:50.209
<i>Welcome to Iron Lake, Harrison.</i>

11:50.251 --> 11:51.711
<i>I'm Angela.</i>

<i>It's really nice to meet you.</i>

<i>Wood's gonna rot if you
don't cover it with a good tarp.</i>

<i>Yeah, I'll get right on that.</i>

12:12.022 --> 12:13.566
<i>Well, hell, Jim,
you got 'em at your own store.</i>

12:13.607 --> 12:14.650
<i>Just pick up a good canvas one.</i>

12:14.692 --> 12:16.235
<i>As long as there's wax on it.</i>

12:16.277 --> 12:17.361
<i>Or a polyurethane one, yeah?</i>

12:17.403 --> 12:19.238
<i>Thanks for the tip, Teddy.</i>

12:19.280 --> 12:21.240
<i>So, you came here by yourself?</i>

12:21.282 --> 12:22.408
<i>It's no big deal.</i>

12:22.450 --> 12:23.743
<i>Used to moving around a lot.</i>

12:23.784 --> 12:24.994
<i>Your mother wasn't worried?</i>

12:25.870 --> 12:27.538
<i>What are you two talking about?</i>

12:27.580 --> 12:30.499
<i>Mom. That she passed away.</i>

12:34.086 --> 12:36.630
<i>Oh, I'm-I'm so sorry.</i>

12:37.298 --> 12:38.924
<i>Mm. Um...</i>

12:38.966 --> 12:41.260
<i>Then, of course,
when that happened,</i>

12:41.302 --> 12:44.847
<i>I came up here to be with Jim.</i>

12:46.474 --> 12:48.642
<i>So, you're here for good?</i>

12:48.684 --> 12:51.437
<i>-Well, you'll love Iron Lake.
- Actually, we haven't...</i>

12:51.479 --> 12:53.564
<i>really talked about it yet,
but...</i>

12:53.606 --> 12:55.149
<i>You should meet
my daughter Audrey.</i>

12:55.191 --> 12:57.026
<i>She's about your age.</i>

13:12.500 --> 13:14.460
<i>Thanks for covering for me.</i>

13:14.502 --> 13:16.629
<i>Didn't do it for you.</i>

13:16.670 --> 13:19.131
<i>Just didn't want a cop
all up in my business.</i>

13:19.590 --> 13:22.968
<i>Huh. Like father, like son.</i>

13:23.511 --> 13:26.639
<i>You'll each be assigned into
groups of four and given a grid.</i>

13:26.680 --> 13:28.390
<i>Search for any sign of Matt.</i>

13:28.432 --> 13:29.892
<i>We'll do two-hour shifts,</i>

13:29.934 --> 13:31.477
<i>then we'll return
to base camp to warm up</i>

13:31.519 --> 13:32.645
<i>and pick a new grid.</i>

13:32.686 --> 13:34.939
<i>-Oh, a-and stay hydrated.
- Okay.</i>

13:34.980 --> 13:36.482
<i>Let's get a move on.</i>

13:38.150 --> 13:39.944
We'll keep
the store closed today, Jim,

13:39.985 --> 13:41.654
<i>but if anybody needs supplies,
feel free to make a run.</i>

13:41.695 --> 13:43.030
<i>-Sure thing.
Teddy.</i>

13:43.072 --> 13:44.698
<i>-Get the drone in the air.
On it!</i>

13:44.740 --> 13:46.116
<i>A drone. Perfect.</i>

13:46.158 --> 13:47.493
<i>Hey.</i>

13:47.535 --> 13:48.327
<i>You didn't include
any Seneca land</i>

13:48.369 --> 13:49.703
<i>in your search area.</i>

13:49.745 --> 13:51.330
<i>I mean, the last thing we need</i>

13:51.372 --> 13:53.833
<i>is a bunch of townsfolk
trampling reservation land.</i>

13:53.874 --> 13:55.626
<i>I asked Abraham Brown
to organize the search</i>

13:55.668 --> 13:57.044
<i>on their side.
They're already in the woods.</i>

13:57.086 --> 13:58.295
<i>Copy that.</i>

13:58.337 --> 13:59.338
<i>That deer was killed</i>

13:59.380 --> 14:00.506
<i>on Seneca land.</i>

14:00.548 --> 14:01.882
<i>They're gonna find it soon.</i>

14:01.924 --> 14:04.260
<i>If I missed a blood trail
to my own cabin,</i>

14:04.301 --> 14:06.345
<i>-what else did I miss?
- Hey.</i>

14:06.387 --> 14:07.680
<i>I was thinking Harrison and I</i>

14:07.721 --> 14:09.473
<i>can take that area
into the woods.</i>

14:09.515 --> 14:10.933
<i>We got it covered, Jim.</i>

14:10.975 --> 14:12.518
<i>No, we want to help.</i>

14:12.560 --> 14:13.853
<i>The terrain gets rough.</i>

14:13.894 --> 14:15.688
<i>My RTV will
get through it faster.</i>

14:15.729 --> 14:16.772
<i>Okay.</i>

14:16.814 --> 14:17.690
<i>Fine.</i>

14:17.731 --> 14:20.609
<i>You and your son can take it.</i>

14:21.235 --> 14:22.528
<i>Ouch.</i>

14:24.238 --> 14:26.115
<i>That thing police-grade?</i>

14:26.156 --> 14:27.491
<i>Of course.</i>

14:27.533 --> 14:29.702
<i>Built-in mapping software?</i>

14:29.743 --> 14:32.580
<i>No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no!</i>

14:37.167 --> 14:38.669
<i>Oh, crap.</i>

14:38.711 --> 14:41.213
<i>[Dexter]</i> <i>I might get away
with this after all.</i>

14:41.255 --> 14:42.548
<i>Sorry, boss!</i>

14:42.590 --> 14:44.383
<i>-What now?
- Logan.</i>

14:44.425 --> 14:46.051
<i>Get the search teams launched.</i>

14:46.093 --> 14:47.761
<i>Yes, boss.
- I'll be back.</i>

14:47.803 --> 14:48.971
<i>Yep.</i>

14:54.101 --> 14:56.353
<i>ominous music</i>

15:16.874 --> 15:19.084
<i></i>

15:29.303 --> 15:31.180
<i>Jesus.</i>

15:35.434 --> 15:37.728
<i>Fucking champagne.</i>

16:06.090 --> 16:08.509
<i>Do you have an appointment?</i>

16:20.980 --> 16:23.482
<i>You're-you're kind of
swerving a lot.</i>

16:23.524 --> 16:26.068
<i>I'm just avoiding rocks.</i>

16:26.110 --> 16:28.487
<i>Usually blood sets
my teeth on edge.</i>

16:28.529 --> 16:30.155
<i>Now it's giving me whiplash.</i>

16:30.197 --> 16:31.782
<i>So, uh...</i>

16:31.824 --> 16:33.826
<i>you and the police chief, huh?</i>

16:33.867 --> 16:35.995
<i>I've only been in Iron Lake
for a couple of years.</i>

16:36.036 --> 16:39.665
<i>This whole Angela thing
is recent.</i>

16:45.004 --> 16:46.130
<i>So-so, why here?</i>

16:46.171 --> 16:49.466
<i>You... do you, like,
hate nice weather?</i>

16:51.218 --> 16:53.595
<i>No, it's quiet, peaceful.</i>

16:53.637 --> 16:55.014
<i>No crime.</i>

16:55.055 --> 16:57.516
<i>No temptations
from the outside world.</i>

16:57.558 --> 16:59.018
<i>No crime?</i>

16:59.059 --> 17:00.728
<i>What, y-you think
this missing guy</i>

17:00.769 --> 17:03.480
<i>just, like, got lost out here?</i>

17:03.522 --> 17:05.149
<i></i>

17:05.190 --> 17:06.650
<i>Probably.</i>

17:06.692 --> 17:09.445
<i>People get lost in these woods
all the time.</i>

17:09.486 --> 17:11.530
<i>Wh-What is that?</i>

17:27.254 --> 17:29.757
<i>You know what,
this could be a crime scene.</i>

17:30.758 --> 17:32.551
<i>That deer was shot
on Seneca land.</i>

17:32.593 --> 17:35.679
<i>It's against the law
to kill them.</i>

17:35.721 --> 17:37.681
<i>We need to tell Angela.</i>

17:37.723 --> 17:40.059
<i>My phone won't work out here.</i>

17:40.100 --> 17:42.519
<i>-Can you drive the RTV?
- Yeah, I should be fine.</i>

17:42.561 --> 17:44.897
<i>All right, just follow the trail
back, and get them here</i>

17:44.938 --> 17:46.648
<i>as fast as you can.</i>

17:46.690 --> 17:48.901
<i>I'll make sure
no one disturbs the scene.</i>

17:57.951 --> 18:01.538
<i>Got to find the source
of that blood trail.</i>

18:10.547 --> 18:13.217
<i>Beautiful, isn't it?</i>

18:14.176 --> 18:16.637
<i>Gauguin's</i> <i>A Farm in Brittany.</i>

18:19.431 --> 18:20.933
<i>Well, look at you.</i>

18:20.974 --> 18:23.268
<i>Chief, if you're here
to apologize</i>

18:23.310 --> 18:24.686
<i>about that little protest
yesterday...</i>

18:24.728 --> 18:26.021
<i>We've got a hunter
who disappeared</i>

18:26.063 --> 18:27.981
<i>in the woods last night.
We're searching</i>

18:28.023 --> 18:30.484
<i>on foot, but we have
over 100 square miles to cover.</i>

18:30.526 --> 18:32.611
<i>You need my helicopter.</i>

18:32.653 --> 18:34.113
<i>It would really help.</i>

18:34.154 --> 18:35.531
<i>Then it's yours.</i>

18:35.572 --> 18:37.741
<i>My pilot was an Army Ranger.
He-he knows the area.</i>

18:37.783 --> 18:40.077
<i>I'll have him coordinate
with your office.</i>

18:40.119 --> 18:41.286
<i>Thank you.</i>

18:41.328 --> 18:42.538
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

18:42.579 --> 18:43.747
<i>I'll be going.</i>

18:43.789 --> 18:45.624
<i>Oh, hold on.</i>

18:45.666 --> 18:47.793
<i>That young woman yesterday, the
one who was leading the protest,</i>

18:47.835 --> 18:50.212
<i>uh, she by any chance
your daughter?</i>

18:50.254 --> 18:52.047
<i>Audrey.</i>

18:52.089 --> 18:55.300
<i>Hmm. Unfortunately,
her generation</i>

18:55.342 --> 18:57.928
<i>sees the world
only in binary terms.</i>

18:57.970 --> 18:59.805
<i>Black and white, good and evil.</i>

18:59.847 --> 19:01.598
<i>And that, uh...</i>

19:01.640 --> 19:03.308
<i>climate change-denying oil baron</i>

19:03.350 --> 19:06.520
<i>persona that people are
all too happy to pin on me,</i>

19:06.562 --> 19:09.648
<i>it ignores all of the good I do.</i>

19:09.690 --> 19:12.442
<i>All of my charity work,
including to the Seneca people.</i>

19:12.484 --> 19:15.279
<i>The supplies I donate every year
to keep that,</i>

19:15.320 --> 19:17.489
<i>uh, reservation
medical clinic running,</i>

19:17.531 --> 19:19.950
<i>the food during the holidays.</i>

19:19.992 --> 19:22.161
<i>It's very much appreciated.</i>

19:22.202 --> 19:23.954
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

19:25.038 --> 19:27.624
<i>We'll get that bird
up in the air for you.</i>

19:27.666 --> 19:30.210
<i>[Dexter]</i> <i>The mystery is,
where did I screw up?</i>

19:30.252 --> 19:32.546
They always say
killers return to the scene

19:32.588 --> 19:34.590
<i>of their crime,
but this is fucking ridiculous.</i>

19:39.678 --> 19:42.014
<i>It's not fucking funny!</i>

20:08.332 --> 20:11.043
<i>Mystery solved.</i>

20:14.922 --> 20:16.215
<i>You think Windexing that rock</i>

20:16.256 --> 20:17.466
<i>is gonna solve
your fucking problem?</i>

20:17.507 --> 20:18.508
<i>Yes.</i>

20:18.550 --> 20:20.427
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

20:20.469 --> 20:22.554
<i>He has your brain.
He's smart enough to know</i>

20:22.596 --> 20:24.556
<i>that people don't fake
their fucking death</i>

20:24.598 --> 20:25.933
<i>if they have nothing to hide!</i>

20:25.974 --> 20:28.769
<i>Who the fuck do you think
you're fooling?!</i>

20:32.773 --> 20:35.567
<i>I told you, the Matt thing was
a one-time screwup.</i>

20:35.609 --> 20:37.569
<i>What the actual fuck
do you think you're doing?</i>

20:37.611 --> 20:39.404
<i>Harrison's been here one day,
and you have him</i>

20:39.446 --> 20:41.949
<i>in the woods looking
for a man you killed?</i>

20:41.990 --> 20:44.534
<i>He'd be so much better off
without you.</i>

20:45.244 --> 20:47.371
<i>He's my son.</i>

20:47.412 --> 20:49.206
<i>I lost him once.</i>

20:49.248 --> 20:51.416
<i>I won't lose him again.</i>

21:09.643 --> 21:13.063
<i>Once again, I have to stay
a step ahead of everyone.</i>

21:13.105 --> 21:15.357
<i>With Matt's help,</i>

21:15.399 --> 21:16.942
<i>I can do that.</i>

21:16.984 --> 21:19.778
<i>Thanks... dude.</i>

21:37.296 --> 21:39.131
<i>Perfect.</i>

21:41.174 --> 21:44.011
<i>More people to mess up
the crime scene.</i>

21:56.064 --> 21:57.816
<i>Hey, Jim.</i>

21:57.858 --> 22:00.152
<i>White buck.</i>

22:00.193 --> 22:02.321
<i>Left here to rot.</i>

22:03.697 --> 22:05.574
<i>Such a waste.</i>

22:05.615 --> 22:08.368
<i>None of us would have done
something like this.</i>

22:11.997 --> 22:14.249
<i>You think maybe
Matt Caldwell would?</i>

22:16.209 --> 22:17.627
<i>He was hunting out here.
It could explain</i>

22:17.669 --> 22:18.920
<i>why we can't find him.</i>

22:18.962 --> 22:19.921
<i>We need to secure the perimeter.</i>

22:19.963 --> 22:22.007
<i>You got it, boss.</i>

22:23.842 --> 22:25.635
<i>This is bullshit, Angela.</i>

22:25.677 --> 22:27.637
<i>I'm betting
the Caldwell kid did this,</i>

22:27.679 --> 22:29.348
<i>then panicked and ran.</i>

22:29.389 --> 22:31.183
<i>The highway is just a couple
of klicks in that direction.</i>

22:31.224 --> 22:33.018
<i>He could've hitched
and ran out of town.</i>

22:33.060 --> 22:35.145
<i>It's plausible.</i>

22:35.187 --> 22:37.356
<i>But there's no evidence
tying Matt to this deer.</i>

22:37.397 --> 22:39.691
<i>So we'll process the scene,</i>

22:39.733 --> 22:42.235
<i>which you're all trampling
right now, so please back up.</i>

22:43.111 --> 22:45.072
<i>Shit. Why does my girlfriend</i>

22:45.113 --> 22:46.406
<i>have to be such a good cop?</i>

22:46.448 --> 22:48.867
<i>For now,
the search for Matt goes on,</i>

22:48.909 --> 22:51.161
<i>including here on Seneca land.</i>

22:51.203 --> 22:53.538
<i>Even after he did this?</i>

22:53.580 --> 22:55.582
<i>If he did this.</i>

22:55.624 --> 22:58.085
<i>Pretty amazing
how the entire town</i>

22:58.126 --> 23:00.212
<i>turns out for a Caldwell.</i>

23:00.253 --> 23:03.298
<i>When one of our girls
goes missing...</i>

23:03.340 --> 23:05.717
<i>"Runaways always come back."</i>

23:05.759 --> 23:09.054
<i>After Iris,
you of all people should know.</i>

23:10.013 --> 23:11.932
<i>Things are different
in Iron Lake now.</i>

23:15.769 --> 23:18.146
<i>Sooner or later,</i>

23:18.188 --> 23:21.233
<i>you're gonna have
to pick a side.</i>

23:28.907 --> 23:31.201
<i>-You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

23:31.243 --> 23:33.703
<i>Harrison was great, by the way.</i>

23:35.580 --> 23:37.082
<i>Good job.</i>

23:37.124 --> 23:38.583
<i>It's no big deal.</i>

23:38.625 --> 23:40.919
<i>Logan, let's get
the processing kit.</i>

23:40.961 --> 23:42.879
<i>Let's see what we can find.</i>

23:42.921 --> 23:46.091
<i>Officer coming through!</i>

23:47.300 --> 23:49.136
<i>Looks like the slug's
still in the carcass.</i>

23:49.177 --> 23:51.054
<i>There's no exit wound.</i>

23:51.096 --> 23:53.432
<i>I sold Matt a rifle and bullets
a couple of days ago.</i>

23:53.473 --> 23:55.642
<i>I could bring in
some of the ammo,</i>

23:55.684 --> 23:58.895
<i>the same stuff, to the station,
see if it's a match.</i>

23:58.937 --> 24:01.648
<i>Oh, my God! I just found this</i>

24:01.690 --> 24:04.443
<i>about a mile down the trail,
right before I got to the...</i>

24:04.484 --> 24:05.444
<i>The highway.</i>

24:05.485 --> 24:07.028
<i>Thank you, Fred Jr.</i>

24:07.070 --> 24:08.738
<i>You magnificent outdoorsman.</i>

24:08.780 --> 24:10.282
<i>Told you.</i>

24:10.323 --> 24:12.367
<i>Chickenshit cut and ran.</i>

24:12.409 --> 24:13.869
<i>How long you been a cop again?</i>

24:13.910 --> 24:16.288
<i>Two weeks... and a half.</i>

24:16.329 --> 24:18.707
<i>Look, this may not even be
Matt's glove.</i>

24:18.748 --> 24:20.750
<i>Someone could've dropped it
a month ago.</i>

24:20.792 --> 24:22.794
<i>Matt had gloves like that
when he was in the store.</i>

24:22.836 --> 24:24.296
<i>Indeed, he did.</i>

24:24.337 --> 24:26.131
<i>I mean, there are
smudges of blood on this.</i>

24:26.173 --> 24:27.632
<i>Let's get this
and the deer back to town.</i>

24:27.674 --> 24:29.509
<i>We'll test the blood.
We'll see if it matches.</i>

24:31.595 --> 24:33.722
<i>Well...</i>

24:33.763 --> 24:36.224
<i>thanks to you,
we got some real leads.</i>

24:36.266 --> 24:38.059
<i>Not bad for your very first
crime scene.</i>

24:38.101 --> 24:40.145
<i>Just lucky we stumbled on it.</i>

24:40.187 --> 24:41.396
<i>You can use my deer sled</i>

24:41.438 --> 24:43.148
<i>to get it back to town
if you want.</i>

24:43.190 --> 24:44.483
<i>If you don't stop being
so helpful, Jim,</i>

24:44.524 --> 24:45.984
<i>I'm gonna have to deputize you.</i>

24:46.026 --> 24:48.820
<i>Y-You guys bring this deer
back to your place,</i>

24:48.862 --> 24:51.114
<i>and we'll take it from there.</i>

24:51.156 --> 24:52.657
<i>Harrison,
the high school just got out,</i>

24:52.699 --> 24:54.868
<i>so the students are
joining the search.</i>

24:54.910 --> 24:57.496
<i>Maybe you can meet
some kids your own age.</i>

24:57.537 --> 24:59.164
<i>That'd be great.</i>

24:59.206 --> 25:00.832
<i>We'll see you back there.</i>

25:00.874 --> 25:03.168
<i>Okay.</i>

25:04.211 --> 25:06.296
<i>Why aren't you a cop anymore?</i>

25:06.338 --> 25:08.507
<i>Technically,
I wasn't actually a cop.</i>

25:08.548 --> 25:11.051
<i>Well, Mom said you were a cop.</i>

25:11.092 --> 25:13.011
<i>And you had to be better
than these guys.</i>

25:13.053 --> 25:14.971
<i>Maybe.</i>

25:15.013 --> 25:17.474
<i>But being at those crime scenes</i>

25:17.516 --> 25:19.851
<i>day after day,</i>

25:19.893 --> 25:21.853
<i>it just got to be too much.</i>

25:21.895 --> 25:23.688
<i>I'm happier now.</i>

25:23.730 --> 25:25.023
<i>Selling night crawlers?</i>

25:25.065 --> 25:26.608
<i>Really?</i>

25:51.091 --> 25:53.718
<i>-Hey, here, take my hat.
- I'm good.</i>

25:57.597 --> 25:59.558
<i>You doing okay with all this?</i>

25:59.599 --> 26:01.434
<i>It's fine.</i>

26:01.476 --> 26:03.812
<i>Kind of cool, actually.</i>

26:03.853 --> 26:05.230
<i>Yo, Coach!</i>

26:05.272 --> 26:06.648
<i>Okay, everyone.</i>

26:06.690 --> 26:07.983
<i>Do exactly
what the officers tell you.</i>

26:08.024 --> 26:10.110
<i>Yo, Zach. Scott. What's up?</i>

26:11.152 --> 26:12.821
<i>Vete.</i>

26:13.863 --> 26:16.616
<i>Go.</i> <i>Y ten cuidado.</i>

26:21.621 --> 26:24.040
<i>Hey, you want to help me
with the goats?</i>

26:24.082 --> 26:25.750
<i>Uh, yeah, sure.</i>

26:25.792 --> 26:28.253
<i>-</i>

26:32.132 --> 26:34.342
<i>You're good with animals.</i>

26:35.260 --> 26:37.429
<i>We had a goat back in Argentina.</i>

26:37.470 --> 26:40.223
<i>Sheep and chickens, too.</i>

26:40.265 --> 26:43.059
<i>I miss 'em. You okay?</i>

26:43.101 --> 26:44.936
<i>What's the black one's name?</i>

26:44.978 --> 26:47.939
<i>Uh... I've just</i>

26:47.981 --> 26:49.608
<i>been calling him Goat.</i>

26:49.649 --> 26:52.944
<i>Haven't gotten around
to properly naming him, I guess.</i>

26:53.528 --> 26:56.031
<i>-What was your goat's name?</i>

26:56.072 --> 26:58.033
<i>Vincent.</i>

26:58.074 --> 26:59.951
<i>Vincent van Goat.</i>

26:59.993 --> 27:01.828
<i>Ha.</i>

27:01.870 --> 27:06.166
<i>Well, Harrison,
meet Vincent van Goat II.</i>

27:14.799 --> 27:16.343
<i>I got to head to the shop</i>

27:16.384 --> 27:18.470
<i>and check on those bullets
I sold Matt.</i>

27:24.142 --> 27:25.560
<i>If you want, you can just hang</i>

27:25.602 --> 27:27.228
<i>inside the cabin
until I get back.</i>

27:27.270 --> 27:29.022
<i>I know how awkward</i>

27:29.064 --> 27:31.316
<i>it can be, meeting new people.</i>

27:33.526 --> 27:36.821
<i>It was hard for me
in high school, too.</i>

27:36.863 --> 27:39.949
<i>Yeah, I survived the last
ten years without you, Jim.</i>

27:39.991 --> 27:42.410
<i>I think I can go two more hours.</i>

28:05.850 --> 28:07.894
<i>Well, he's not
an awkward-as-fuck</i>

28:07.936 --> 28:09.979
<i>budding serial killer
like you were.</i>

28:10.021 --> 28:11.940
<i>Does that mean you're gonna
start laughing at me again?</i>

28:11.981 --> 28:13.191
<i>I don't know, you tell me.</i>

28:13.233 --> 28:14.901
<i>I know he shouldn't be
around you.</i>

28:14.943 --> 28:16.403
<i>Around this version of me.</i>

28:16.444 --> 28:18.238
<i>Jim Lindsay, he's safe.</i>

28:18.279 --> 28:19.572
<i>You're starting
to sound an awful lot</i>

28:19.614 --> 28:21.700
<i>-like the old Dexter to me.
- I'm not.</i>

28:21.741 --> 28:23.201
<i>You are.</i>

28:23.243 --> 28:25.578
<i>You fucking love that you're
getting away with murder.</i>

28:25.620 --> 28:27.372
<i>You can't wait to kill again.</i>

28:27.414 --> 28:29.916
<i>You are a fucking serial killer!</i>

28:29.958 --> 28:31.543
<i>You are gonna fail this boy</i>

28:31.584 --> 28:33.211
<i>a thousand different ways
because of it!</i>

28:33.253 --> 28:35.714
<i>Stop!</i>

28:48.226 --> 28:49.644
<i>Peace.</i>

28:49.686 --> 28:51.604
<i>-I wish.</i>

28:55.108 --> 28:56.568
<i>I guess you met my mom.</i>

28:56.609 --> 28:57.736
<i>The cop.</i>

28:57.777 --> 28:59.404
<i>Chief of police.</i>

28:59.446 --> 29:01.072
<i>The one dating your dad.</i>

29:01.114 --> 29:02.949
<i>That part I figured out,</i>

29:02.991 --> 29:05.535
<i>which-which makes this
not awkward at all.</i>

29:05.577 --> 29:07.495
<i>Yeah. Don't worry.</i>

29:07.537 --> 29:09.456
<i>Knowing my mom,
it won't last long.</i>

29:09.497 --> 29:11.541
<i>She's pretty much married
to her job.</i>

29:14.836 --> 29:17.422
<i>You want to come
on the search with us?</i>

29:20.133 --> 29:22.802
<i>Sure.</i>

29:24.721 --> 29:26.598
<i>Hey, guys.</i>

29:28.183 --> 29:30.477
<i>Zach and Scott.</i>

29:30.518 --> 29:32.312
<i>They're smarter than they look.</i>

29:32.353 --> 29:34.063
<i>Well, Zach is.</i>

29:34.105 --> 29:35.231
<i>Duh.</i>

29:35.273 --> 29:37.692
<i>Me Scott.</i>

29:37.734 --> 29:39.819
<i>Harrison.</i>

29:42.739 --> 29:45.200
<i>slow, dramatic music</i>

30:49.222 --> 30:50.306
<i>Appreciate this, Gig.</i>

30:50.348 --> 30:51.683
<i>Glad to help.</i>

30:54.894 --> 30:57.272
<i>-Hey.</i>

30:57.313 --> 30:58.857
<i>It's not a big deal.</i>

30:58.898 --> 31:00.024
<i>A lot of folks get queasy
at the sight of blood.</i>

31:00.066 --> 31:02.026
<i>-Yeah, it gets to me every time.
- Yeah.</i>

31:02.068 --> 31:03.528
<i>Looks like the shooter
didn't know what he was doing</i>

31:03.570 --> 31:05.196
<i>or was a piss-poor shot.</i>

31:05.238 --> 31:07.365
<i>Deer's got a shattered shoulder,</i>

31:07.407 --> 31:09.284
<i>uh, bone splinter everywhere.</i>

31:09.325 --> 31:11.452
<i>You feel the slug?</i>

31:12.161 --> 31:14.455
<i>Yep.</i>

31:20.420 --> 31:22.505
<i>What do you think?</i>

31:22.547 --> 31:24.549
<i>Looks like a hollow-point
seven Mag to me.</i>

31:24.591 --> 31:27.218
<i>The bullets I sold Matt were...</i>

31:27.260 --> 31:28.887
<i>160-grain hollow-point</i>

31:28.928 --> 31:31.055
<i>seven-millimeter
Remington Magnums.</i>

31:31.097 --> 31:33.182
<i>The plot thins.</i>

31:33.224 --> 31:35.602
<i>Looks like there's
some striation on the base.</i>

31:35.643 --> 31:37.562
<i>We might be able to match it
to Matt's gun when we find it.</i>

31:37.604 --> 31:39.439
<i>Thanks, Gig.</i>

31:40.398 --> 31:41.524
<i>Looks like my work's done here.</i>

31:41.566 --> 31:43.109
<i>I better get back to Harrison.</i>

31:43.151 --> 31:45.069
<i>Harrison's with Audrey
on the search. They're fine.</i>

31:45.111 --> 31:46.946
<i>You and I, on the other hand,
need to talk.</i>

31:46.988 --> 31:49.073
<i>[Dexter]</i> <i>"We need to talk."
Words you never want to hear</i>

31:49.115 --> 31:51.200
<i>from your doctor
or your girlfriend.</i>

31:55.455 --> 31:57.290
<i>Cool shirt.</i>

31:57.332 --> 31:58.625
<i>You mean her "myew" shirt?</i>

31:58.666 --> 32:00.335
<i>Wh-What does it even mean?</i>

32:00.376 --> 32:02.420
<i>Married monsters in...</i>

32:02.462 --> 32:05.173
<i>Missing and Murdered
Indigenous Women.</i>

32:05.214 --> 32:07.258
<i>Oh. Fuck.</i>

32:07.300 --> 32:09.093
<i>Hey, yo. It's just up here.</i>

32:09.135 --> 32:10.887
<i>Where?</i>

32:10.929 --> 32:12.263
<i>Sorry you ended up in Iron Lake.</i>

32:12.305 --> 32:13.765
<i>Sucks here.</i>

32:13.806 --> 32:16.100
<i>I think I'm just
passing through, actually.</i>

32:16.142 --> 32:17.518
<i>Yeah?</i>

32:17.560 --> 32:20.605
<i>Well, lucky you.</i>

32:23.566 --> 32:25.526
<i>-So, where--?
- So, what is it--?</i>

32:25.568 --> 32:27.403
<i>You go.</i>

32:27.445 --> 32:29.447
<i>Uh, I was gonna ask,</i>

32:29.489 --> 32:31.616
<i>what's it like being
the police chief's daughter?</i>

32:31.658 --> 32:33.326
<i>So much fun.</i>

32:33.368 --> 32:34.619
<i>She never checks up on me.</i>

32:34.661 --> 32:36.287
<i>Never assumes
I've been murdered</i>

32:36.329 --> 32:37.497
<i>when she hasn't heard
from me for, like, ten minutes.</i>

32:38.623 --> 32:40.166
<i>It's great.</i>

32:40.208 --> 32:42.126
<i>That kind of reminds me
of my stepmom.</i>

32:42.168 --> 32:44.587
<i>My dad, not so much.</i>

32:44.629 --> 32:46.798
<i>Oh, and you live
with your stepmom?</i>

32:46.839 --> 32:49.092
<i>Yo, this is it!</i>

32:54.681 --> 32:56.224
<i>Shit, hide!</i>

33:07.527 --> 33:09.654
<i>That had to be Olsen.</i>

33:09.696 --> 33:11.781
<i>Who's that?</i>

33:11.823 --> 33:14.200
<i>Petrochemical billionaire asshole.</i>

33:16.285 --> 33:18.162
<i>Aren't we supposed to be
looking for this Matt guy?</i>

33:18.204 --> 33:20.331
<i>The whole town and
the reservation are searching.</i>

33:20.373 --> 33:22.166
<i>They even got a helicopter.</i>

33:22.208 --> 33:23.584
<i>They don't need us.</i>

33:23.626 --> 33:25.003
<i>And Matt Caldwell's
an entitled prick,</i>

33:25.044 --> 33:27.338
<i>so fuck him. We're gonna party.</i>

33:27.380 --> 33:29.966
<i>Hold up.</i>

33:30.008 --> 33:32.218
<i>They put new locks
on the cabin doors.</i>

33:33.469 --> 33:35.972
<i>Leave it to me.</i>

33:38.725 --> 33:41.352
<i>-Son of a...</i>

33:41.394 --> 33:43.312
<i>I got it.</i>

33:45.189 --> 33:47.275
<i>Give me a sec.</i>

34:02.915 --> 34:05.710
<i>Mom is really not gonna
like you.</i>

34:21.601 --> 34:23.144
<i>Here it comes.</i>

34:23.186 --> 34:25.021
<i>The moment
the girlfriend tells me</i>

34:25.063 --> 34:27.398
<i>I'm too closed-off,
that it's not gonna work out.</i>

34:27.440 --> 34:29.025
<i>I'm thrilled Harrison is here.</i>

34:29.067 --> 34:30.860
<i>Then again...</i>

34:30.902 --> 34:32.028
<i>You are?</i>

34:32.070 --> 34:33.780
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:34.947 --> 34:37.241
<i>I know you've been private
about your past.</i>

34:37.283 --> 34:38.910
<i>It's okay.</i>

34:38.951 --> 34:40.745
<i>Everyone has secrets.</i>

34:40.787 --> 34:42.872
<i>Ange, I never meant
for it to be a secret.</i>

34:42.914 --> 34:44.540
<i>It's fine.
We all have things</i>

34:44.582 --> 34:45.708
<i>we keep from each other,
right?</i>

34:45.750 --> 34:47.835
<i>For instance...</i>

34:48.961 --> 34:50.588
<i>I'm not Audrey's birth mother.</i>

34:50.630 --> 34:52.757
<i>Oh.</i>

34:52.799 --> 34:54.050
<i>You adopted her?</i>

34:54.092 --> 34:55.218
<i>Yeah.</i>

34:55.259 --> 34:58.096
<i>Did you ever look
for the birth mom?</i>

34:59.263 --> 35:00.932
<i>I've spent pretty much
my entire adult life</i>

35:00.973 --> 35:02.767
<i>looking for missing women.</i>

35:02.809 --> 35:05.603
<i>But one who abandons
her own baby?</i>

35:07.105 --> 35:08.272
<i>Fuck her.</i>

35:14.112 --> 35:17.949
<i>You could have shared your
Harrison situation with me.</i>

35:17.990 --> 35:22.078
<i>This whole time, I've been
struggling with Audrey,</i>

35:22.120 --> 35:24.789
<i>thinking I couldn't share
that part of my life with you.</i>

35:24.831 --> 35:26.874
<i>But now Harrison's here,</i>

35:26.916 --> 35:29.252
<i>and maybe that's
an opportunity for us, too.</i>

35:29.293 --> 35:31.295
<i>We can talk parenting...</i>

35:31.337 --> 35:34.799
<i>the pressures,
the worry, the guilt.</i>

35:36.676 --> 35:39.428
<i>-So that's me,</i>

35:39.470 --> 35:41.264
<i>sharing,</i>

35:41.305 --> 35:43.641
<i>giving you</i>

35:43.683 --> 35:44.976
<i>an opening to share back.</i>

35:45.017 --> 35:46.727
<i>-Right.
-'Cause that's...</i>

35:46.769 --> 35:48.187
<i>that's how it works.</i>

35:52.150 --> 35:54.026
<i>I don't know that
I can always be the father</i>

35:54.068 --> 35:56.112
<i>Harrison needs me to be.</i>

35:56.154 --> 35:58.281
<i>I feel that way
about being a mom every day.</i>

35:58.322 --> 36:00.199
<i>-You do?
- Yeah.</i>

36:00.241 --> 36:02.994
<i>But it doesn't matter
because Audrey needs me.</i>

36:03.035 --> 36:05.830
<i>Just like Harrison needs you.</i>

36:05.872 --> 36:08.166
<i>So the good news is,</i>

36:08.207 --> 36:12.170
<i>all you really have
to do is just...</i>

36:12.211 --> 36:13.588
<i>show up.</i>

36:13.629 --> 36:15.089
<i>Show up?</i>

36:15.131 --> 36:16.924
<i>You make it sound so easy.</i>

36:16.966 --> 36:18.634
<i>Also gonna have
to enroll him in school.</i>

36:18.676 --> 36:20.011
<i>Obviously.</i>

36:20.052 --> 36:22.221
<i>And get him
some real winter clothes.</i>

36:22.263 --> 36:24.682
<i>And he's probably gonna
need a car.</i>

36:24.724 --> 36:28.019
<i>College apps are coming up,
so add tutors and exam prep.</i>

36:28.060 --> 36:29.937
<i>[Dexter]</i> <i>Harrison's been here
less than a day,</i>

36:29.979 --> 36:31.814
<i>and now I'm talking
about college prep.</i>

36:31.856 --> 36:34.275
<i>Just wait till
he starts dating.</i>

36:39.488 --> 36:42.867
<i>Maybe just start
with a cot or something.</i>

36:42.909 --> 36:44.994
<i>A cot. I can do that.</i>

36:45.036 --> 36:46.370
<i>Okay.</i>

36:46.412 --> 36:48.206
<i>Don't worry.</i>

36:48.247 --> 36:51.167
<i>Harrison's gonna love it here.</i>

36:51.209 --> 36:54.837
<i>In fact, I bet Audrey
and her friends</i>

36:54.879 --> 36:56.797
<i>are taking great care
of him right now.</i>

37:02.720 --> 37:03.679
<i>No, I'm good.</i>

37:03.721 --> 37:05.431
<i>Scott?</i>

37:05.473 --> 37:08.726
<i>So, what are you, like,
straight edge or something, man?</i>

37:08.768 --> 37:10.186
<i>Don't think
that's a thing anymore.</i>

37:10.228 --> 37:13.105
<i>-Wait. Are you a Mormon?</i>

37:13.147 --> 37:15.316
<i>I kind of have
a history with drugs.</i>

37:15.358 --> 37:17.610
<i>I got clean
a couple years ago, though.</i>

37:17.652 --> 37:22.365
<i>Whoa. Anyone want a kick-ass
Roaring Forks beach towel?</i>

37:22.406 --> 37:23.824
<i>No.</i>

37:23.866 --> 37:25.701
<i>So, where are you
headed after this?</i>

37:25.743 --> 37:28.329
<i>Uh, I-I just got up here
from Florida.</i>

37:28.371 --> 37:30.039
<i>-Is that where your mom lives?
- Stepmom.</i>

37:30.081 --> 37:32.208
<i>Um, actually, my mom died
when I was really young,</i>

37:32.250 --> 37:35.336
<i>and my stepmom died of cancer
a couple years ago.</i>

37:35.378 --> 37:37.505
<i>-I'm so sorry.</i>

37:38.297 --> 37:41.259
<i>-Was your mom sick?
- What?</i>

37:41.300 --> 37:43.844
<i>You said your stepmom died
of cancer,</i>

37:43.886 --> 37:45.846
<i>so how'd your real mom die?</i>

37:46.973 --> 37:48.099
<i>You know what?</i>

37:48.140 --> 37:49.934
<i>I shouldn't have asked.</i>

37:49.976 --> 37:51.435
<i>It's none of our business.</i>

37:51.477 --> 37:54.272
<i>No, it's fine.</i>

37:54.313 --> 37:56.440
<i>I feel the pain of everyone</i>

37:56.482 --> 37:57.900
<i>I'm freezing.</i>

37:57.942 --> 37:59.443
<i>I'm gonna go get
some wood for the fire.</i>

38:01.946 --> 38:06.325
<i>Then I feel nothing</i>

38:07.994 --> 38:09.704
<i>Well, that's on you.</i>

38:09.745 --> 38:12.331
<i>-You made that worse.
- Either way, dude's weird.</i>

38:12.373 --> 38:14.000
<i>And we're trapped</i>

38:14.041 --> 38:15.918
<i>in an abandoned cabin
in the woods with him.</i>

38:15.960 --> 38:17.295
<i>Stop watching slasher films.</i>

38:17.336 --> 38:19.088
<i>Just saying
we know nothing about him.</i>

38:19.797 --> 38:21.215
<i>But we can.</i>

38:22.675 --> 38:23.843
<i>Sick.</i>

38:23.884 --> 38:25.261
<i>That's fucked-up.</i>

38:25.303 --> 38:27.388
<i>Relax.</i>

38:27.430 --> 38:29.348
<i>Just making sure he doesn't have
a fucking manifesto in here</i>

38:29.390 --> 38:31.767
<i>-or some shit.
- Okay, no manifesto, so stop.</i>

38:31.809 --> 38:34.645
<i>We got an artist here.</i>

38:37.064 --> 38:38.607
<i>So he's actually good
at something,</i>

38:38.649 --> 38:40.735
<i>-unlike the two of you.
- We're good at stuff.</i>

38:40.776 --> 38:42.403
<i>Pinning half-naked guys to mats.</i>

38:42.445 --> 38:44.447
<i>Wrestling is
an Olympic sport, Audrey.</i>

38:44.488 --> 38:45.781
<i>So is Ping-Pong.</i>

38:45.823 --> 38:47.658
<i>What the fuck
are you guys doing?</i>

38:47.700 --> 38:49.910
<i>Stop. Put that away.</i>

38:54.540 --> 38:56.417
<i>Shit.</i>

38:58.544 --> 39:01.005
<i>Got the wood.</i>

39:01.047 --> 39:03.883
<i>Cool. Thanks.</i>

39:03.924 --> 39:05.926
<i>quiet, tense music</i>

39:40.378 --> 39:43.005
<i>Where the fuck is my phone?</i>

39:59.271 --> 40:00.981
<i>Hello?</i>

40:02.525 --> 40:03.692
<i>Hello?!</i>

40:03.734 --> 40:05.236
<i>Is anyone there?</i>

40:06.695 --> 40:09.240
<i>Hey! Let me the fuck out!</i>

40:09.281 --> 40:12.493
<i>What the fuck is...?!</i>

40:26.507 --> 40:27.967
<i>Oh.</i>

40:33.264 --> 40:34.765
Thank you.

40:34.807 --> 40:35.933
<i>-There you go.
-[Dexter]</i> <i>I hide the blood.</i>

40:35.975 --> 40:37.560
<i>I plant a glove.</i>

40:37.601 --> 40:39.437
<i>I match the bullet
in the deer to Matt's gun.</i>

40:39.478 --> 40:41.897
<i>All to get the good people
of Iron Lake off my land.</i>

40:41.939 --> 40:45.484
<i>And yet here I am,
feeding them hamburgers.</i>

40:45.526 --> 40:49.238
<i>If I prayed,
I'd pray for this to be over.</i>

40:57.496 --> 40:58.789
<i>Everyone!</i>

40:58.831 --> 41:01.000
<i>We do not think Matt Caldwell
is in these woods,</i>

41:01.041 --> 41:03.043
<i>so we are shutting down
the search!</i>

41:03.085 --> 41:04.920
<i>Wow, prayer answered.</i>

41:06.338 --> 41:08.132
<i>-So the glove was a match?
- Matt's friend</i>

41:08.174 --> 41:09.550
<i>confirmed it was his.</i>

41:09.592 --> 41:10.968
<i>And the smudges on it
were deer blood.</i>

41:11.010 --> 41:13.429
<i>So he did shoot that deer.</i>

41:13.471 --> 41:16.223
And then probably fled
to avoid prosecution.

41:16.265 --> 41:18.392
<i>I'm guessing he's halfway
to New York by now.</i>

41:18.434 --> 41:20.144
<i>Great job cracking the case.</i>

41:20.186 --> 41:22.980
<i>And completely buying
into my narrative.</i>

41:23.022 --> 41:24.607
<i>It's not closed yet.</i>

41:24.648 --> 41:25.816
<i>We're still trying
to get in touch with his dad.</i>

41:25.858 --> 41:27.818
<i>Take the compliment.</i>

41:27.860 --> 41:29.528
Thank you.

41:29.570 --> 41:32.323
<i>And I'm glad
the idiot's all right.</i>

41:32.364 --> 41:33.491
<i>I mean, last thing
this town needed</i>

41:33.532 --> 41:35.451
<i>was finding a body
in the woods.</i>

41:35.493 --> 41:36.660
<i>Yeah.</i>

41:36.702 --> 41:39.038
<i>So, we'll be out
of your hair soon.</i>

41:39.079 --> 41:40.706
<i>And when Harrison is settled,</i>

41:40.748 --> 41:42.333
<i>you should bring him
over for dinner.</i>

41:42.374 --> 41:45.878
<i>I'll make my grandmother's
hulled corn soup.</i>

41:45.920 --> 41:47.213
<i>I'm sure he'd love that.</i>

41:48.672 --> 41:50.132
<i>But...</i>

41:50.174 --> 41:52.384
<i>it'll have to be after Audrey's
done being grounded.</i>

41:52.426 --> 41:55.346
<i>What?
Are you kidding me?</i>

41:55.387 --> 41:56.680
<i>So you didn't just spend
the entire afternoon hanging out</i>

41:56.722 --> 41:58.390
<i>at the Roaring Forks
Summer Camp?</i>

41:58.432 --> 42:00.726
What? No way.

42:00.768 --> 42:02.228
<i>That's-that's crazy.</i>

42:02.269 --> 42:05.356
<i>Scott, you're literally wearing
a Roaring Forks T-shirt</i>

42:05.397 --> 42:07.691
<i>that's two sizes too small
right now.</i>

42:07.733 --> 42:09.318
Shit.

42:09.360 --> 42:11.320
<i>Who cares?
Matt Caldwell's an asshole.</i>

42:11.362 --> 42:12.780
<i>Audrey!</i>

42:12.821 --> 42:14.532
<i>And since everyone's packing up,</i>

42:14.573 --> 42:17.201
<i>I'm guessing you found him
and he's fine?</i>

42:17.243 --> 42:20.120
<i>Not the point.
I didn't know where you were.</i>

42:20.162 --> 42:21.372
<i>It's dangerous out there.</i>

42:21.413 --> 42:23.374
<i>-You have no idea.
- Nó'yëh,</i> <i>stop.</i>

42:23.415 --> 42:24.792
<i>I've heard it all before.</i>

42:24.833 --> 42:26.877
<i>How many times
do I have to tell you?</i>

42:26.919 --> 42:30.256
<i>I'm not Iris.</i>

42:32.758 --> 42:34.885
<i>Get in the SUV.
We're going home.</i>

42:34.927 --> 42:36.720
<i>-Let's go, Zach.
- Well...</i>

42:36.762 --> 42:39.515
<i>I kind of don't want
to get arrested, so...</i>

42:39.557 --> 42:41.225
<i>She's not gonna arrest you.</i>

42:41.267 --> 42:45.104
<i>She only acts like a crazed,
overbearing dictator with me.</i>

42:47.940 --> 42:50.276
<i>Come on, Zach.</i>

42:54.905 --> 42:57.908
<i>Sorry you and Harrison
had to see that.</i>

42:57.950 --> 43:00.578
<i>Parenting's just learning
as you go, right?</i>

43:00.619 --> 43:02.496
<i>It'll be okay.</i>

43:03.914 --> 43:05.040
<i>Thanks.</i>

43:05.082 --> 43:06.834
<i>gentle, somber music</i>

43:15.301 --> 43:18.220
<i>It's just a few things,</i>

43:18.262 --> 43:21.015
<i>in case you decide
you want to stay.</i>

43:21.056 --> 43:23.601
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

43:23.642 --> 43:26.937
<i>I-I didn't come here
for all this.</i>

43:26.979 --> 43:28.897
<i>I came here for answers.</i>

43:30.399 --> 43:33.444
<i>Ask me whatever you want.</i>

43:35.154 --> 43:37.781
<i>Why did you leave us?</i>

43:37.823 --> 43:40.784
<i>Was it because of
what you wrote in the letter?</i>

43:40.826 --> 43:42.620
<i>What I wrote?</i>

43:57.635 --> 44:00.804
<i>"Reach out to me if Harrison
shows any dark tendencies."</i>

44:00.846 --> 44:02.890
<i>gentle music</i>

44:02.931 --> 44:05.893
<i>Dark tendencies?</i>

44:05.934 --> 44:08.520
<i>What does that mean?</i>

44:08.562 --> 44:11.482
<i>What was so wrong with me
that-that you not only left</i>

44:11.523 --> 44:14.318
<i>but faked your own death
to hide from me?</i>

44:14.360 --> 44:16.111
<i>-It wasn't you.
- But...</i>

44:16.153 --> 44:18.947
<i>"Dark tendencies"?</i>

44:18.989 --> 44:20.574
<i>Wh-What did you see in me?</i>

44:20.616 --> 44:23.452
<i>Nothing bad.
You were perfect.</i>

44:23.494 --> 44:25.496
<i>You were this sweet, smart,</i>

44:25.537 --> 44:28.916
<i>trusting little boy
with a huge heart.</i>

44:32.711 --> 44:34.672
<i>It wasn't you I was scared of.</i>

44:34.713 --> 44:37.841
<i>It was me.</i>

44:43.472 --> 44:46.266
<i>I've always had...</i>

44:48.769 --> 44:50.562
<i>...my demons.</i>

44:50.604 --> 44:54.400
<i>And I was scared
that I'd mess you up,</i>

44:54.441 --> 44:56.694
<i>that I'd pass that on.</i>

44:56.735 --> 44:58.862
<i>And so...</i>

44:58.904 --> 45:00.698
<i>I went away.</i>

45:00.739 --> 45:03.283
<i>Because of what I am,
not because of who you are.</i>

45:03.325 --> 45:04.910
<i>I-I-I don't understand.</i>

45:04.952 --> 45:08.372
<i>I was in a dark place
after I lost your mom.</i>

45:09.498 --> 45:10.999
<i>And then Aunt Deb,</i>

45:11.041 --> 45:13.335
<i>and all that death.</i>

45:14.294 --> 45:16.588
<i>I got lost.</i>

45:19.717 --> 45:22.386
<i>And I thought you would thrive</i>

45:22.428 --> 45:24.930
<i>in Argentina with Hannah.</i>

45:26.432 --> 45:29.059
<i>She was always so good
with you.</i>

45:29.101 --> 45:30.519
<i>Walking away from you</i>

45:30.561 --> 45:33.272
<i>is the hardest thing
I've ever done.</i>

45:34.356 --> 45:37.443
<i>And I regret it
so much now, because...</i>

45:38.736 --> 45:41.905
<i>I never imagined
you'd be left alone.</i>

45:46.785 --> 45:50.539
<i>After Hannah told me
you were dead,</i>

45:50.581 --> 45:54.585
<i>I-I kept a photo
of you by my bed.</i>

45:54.626 --> 45:56.712
<i>I would look at it every night.</i>

45:58.672 --> 46:01.592
<i>And for a long time,
I cried myself to sleep.</i>

46:02.676 --> 46:05.262
<i>And then I found that letter.</i>

46:07.097 --> 46:09.224
<i>I...</i>

46:09.266 --> 46:11.560
<i>I was so angry.</i>

46:11.602 --> 46:13.812
<i>Of course you were.</i>

46:17.816 --> 46:19.902
<i>But maybe I can be there
for you now.</i>

46:22.738 --> 46:24.531
<i>Do-do you really mean that?</i>

46:24.573 --> 46:26.909
<i>If you're willing to risk the
chance that I'll screw you up.</i>

46:26.950 --> 46:30.037
<i>Stop acting like
you're such an evil person.</i>

46:30.078 --> 46:32.456
<i>I-I don't remember a lot,</i>

46:32.498 --> 46:35.959
<i>but all of my memories
of you are good.</i>

46:36.001 --> 46:39.379
<i>The... the worst thing
you ever did was...</i>

46:39.421 --> 46:41.381
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

46:42.341 --> 46:44.468
<i>...leave me.</i>

46:48.639 --> 46:51.350
<i>So, yeah, I'll stay.</i>

46:52.851 --> 46:54.144
<i>For a while.</i>

46:54.186 --> 46:55.896
<i>Great.</i>

46:58.357 --> 46:59.483
<i>In the morning, we can talk</i>

46:59.525 --> 47:00.943
<i>about getting you
set up at school.</i>

47:00.984 --> 47:04.321
<i>But not over
blueberry pancakes.</i>

47:04.363 --> 47:06.448
<i>I mean, regular pancakes</i>

47:06.490 --> 47:08.367
<i>wouldn't be completely
out of the question.</i>

47:08.408 --> 47:11.036
<i>Regular pancakes sound good.</i>

47:36.228 --> 47:40.023
<i>Ugh. How did you know
this is exactly what I need?</i>

47:40.065 --> 47:41.775
<i>Lucky guess.</i>

47:46.905 --> 47:49.867
<i>You don't have to enjoy
the win so much.</i>

47:51.076 --> 47:53.120
<i>You smug fuck.</i>

48:10.721 --> 48:13.015
<i>Angela.</i>

48:13.056 --> 48:15.934
<i>I came as soon as I...
as I could.</i>

48:15.976 --> 48:17.644
<i>What's going on?</i>

48:17.686 --> 48:19.771
<i>Did you find him?
Tell me he's okay.</i>

48:19.813 --> 48:22.065
Kurt, we've been trying
to contact you for hours.

48:22.107 --> 48:24.401
<i>We found evidence that Matt
may have committed a crime.</i>

48:24.443 --> 48:26.528
<i>What?</i>

48:26.570 --> 48:28.947
<i>What... what crime?</i>

48:28.989 --> 48:31.450
<i>Killing an animal
on reservation land.</i>

48:31.491 --> 48:33.785
<i>Evidence points to him
fleeing the area.</i>

48:33.827 --> 48:35.829
<i>-What are you talking about?
My son and I</i>

48:35.871 --> 48:38.749
<i>found a dead white deer,
Mr. Caldwell.</i>

48:38.790 --> 48:42.336
<i>Matt killed it, realized
he screwed up and left town.</i>

48:42.377 --> 48:44.922
<i>No. No, no, no, no, no.
He would've called me</i>

48:44.963 --> 48:46.924
<i>if he was in trouble.
He always does.</i>

48:46.965 --> 48:49.384
<i>And a poaching fine
isn't gonna scare him.</i>

48:49.426 --> 48:51.261
<i>It's not just poaching, Kurt.</i>

48:51.303 --> 48:54.765
<i>Matt killed a white buck
on reservation land.</i>

48:54.806 --> 48:57.100
<i>And I'm telling you
that he would've called me.</i>

48:57.142 --> 48:58.936
<i>He's out there.</i>

48:58.977 --> 49:02.356
<i>Look, I know Matt's not perfect</i>

49:02.397 --> 49:03.649
<i>and he's made mistakes in life,</i>

49:03.690 --> 49:05.817
<i>but he doesn't deserve
to freeze to death</i>

49:05.859 --> 49:07.736
<i>in the woods tonight, 'cause
that's what's gonna happen</i>

49:07.778 --> 49:08.987
<i>if you call the search off.</i>

49:09.029 --> 49:10.572
<i>Kurt, can we talk
about this inside?</i>

49:10.614 --> 49:12.407
<i>No, goddamn it!
My son has disappeared,</i>

49:12.449 --> 49:14.201
<i>and we need to find him now.</i>

<i>Everybody!</i>

<i>Hey.</i>

49:23.543 --> 49:25.003
<i>I need...</i>

49:25.045 --> 49:27.756
<i>I need you to stand up for me,
for my family.</i>

49:27.798 --> 49:30.592
<i>Same way we've stood up for you.</i>

49:30.634 --> 49:33.553
<i>I mean,
we-we've donated the trucks</i>

49:33.595 --> 49:35.597
<i>to the volunteer
fire department.</i>

49:35.639 --> 49:38.183
<i>Uh, we sponsor the Harvest Fest
every year.</i>

49:38.225 --> 49:41.895
<i>I mean, Fred, when-when your
dad's store's roof fell in,</i>

49:41.937 --> 49:44.106
<i>who fronted him
for the repairs, huh?</i>

49:44.147 --> 49:45.732
<i>Right.</i>

49:45.774 --> 49:47.234
<i>I mean, come on.
Half your kids grew up</i>

<i>working at my truck stop.</i>

49:50.654 --> 49:53.323
<i>This is Iron Lake.</i>

49:53.365 --> 49:54.825
<i>We look out for each other.</i>

49:57.369 --> 49:59.997
<i>So, please, I'm begging you.</i>

50:00.038 --> 50:02.916
<i>Do not give up on my son now.</i>

50:02.958 --> 50:04.835
<i>Now, when he needs us the most.</i>

50:07.421 --> 50:10.841
<i>Okay. We'll keep going
through the night.</i>

50:10.882 --> 50:13.135
Thank you, Angela.

50:13.176 --> 50:14.344
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

50:14.386 --> 50:17.806
<i>Whatever resources you need,
anything at all.</i>

50:17.848 --> 50:19.057
<i>Means the world to me.</i>

50:19.099 --> 50:21.184
<i>Okay. We're going back in.</i>

50:21.226 --> 50:23.854
<i>Stay in your groups
and bundle up.</i>

50:23.895 --> 50:26.523
<i>It's gonna be
a long, cold night.</i>

50:30.235 --> 50:34.364
<i>So... I guess we'll be
here a little bit longer.</i>

50:34.406 --> 50:36.033
<i>That's not a problem.</i>

50:36.074 --> 50:37.701
<i>This your boy, Jim?</i>

50:37.743 --> 50:40.912
<i>Yes. Harrison,
this is, uh, Kurt Caldwell.</i>

50:40.954 --> 50:42.372
<i>Nice to meet you,
Mr. Caldwell.</i>

50:42.414 --> 50:44.499
<i>Likewise.</i>

50:44.541 --> 50:47.169
<i>Matt's out there.
I know it.</i>

50:47.210 --> 50:51.423
<i>I'm gonna find him,
