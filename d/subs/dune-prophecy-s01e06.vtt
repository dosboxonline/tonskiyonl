exploit.

Javicco asked me
to bring you a message.

16:51.636 --> 16:53.637
- He wants to see you.
- No.

16:53.638 --> 16:55.432

reign is over.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.349
Your plan is
working, Valya.

16:57.350 --> 17:00.477
My imprint still holds.
He wants to give me
Natalya's mantle.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.147
Don't be naive.

17:03.064 --> 17:05.942
He can't divorce
without damaging
the coalition.

17:06.317 --> 17:08.986
It would put
the whole Imperium
on a course to war.

17:08.987 --> 17:11.197
- Then I'll get him
to release Nez.
- No.

17:12.323 --> 17:13.992

17:14.659 --> 17:16.535
Corrino has
forfeited his right

Mother Superior.

that we are not seeing.

just out of view.

17:41.019 --> 17:44.230

of my son.

any tool can be used

18:24.771 --> 18:26.230

of humanity.

18:43.790 --> 18:46.709
Anirul, search
the genetic index
of the entire Imperium

to find us the union
we need.

19:17.490 --> 19:20.242
Young Valya:

19:20.243 --> 19:21.618
A daughter born
to their pairing

19:21.619 --> 19:23.830
would have all
the traits we desire.

19:24.372 --> 19:27.125
A tremendous aptitude
for the Sisterhood.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.585
How do we ensure
she joins the Sisterhood

19:29.586 --> 19:31.463

the throne?

19:31.838 --> 19:35.466
With our finest Truthsayer
by her father's side,
of course,

19:35.467 --> 19:38.135

under our wing.

19:38.136 --> 19:40.012

is still a child

19:40.013 --> 19:42.098
and Javicco Corrino
is not yet emperor.

19:42.891 --> 19:45.518
- Anything could happen
before then.
- Yes...

19:46.978 --> 19:49.355
unless we send someone
to keep Javicco occupied

19:49.356 --> 19:52.317
until Natalya's ready
to stand by his side.

19:53.276 --> 19:55.028
You mean imprint

19:56.321 --> 20:00.283
They will have a daughter.
She will be our empress.

20:01.034 --> 20:04.079
We pledged
to put a Sister
on the throne.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.832
This is how
we do it.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.543
But Dorotea's disciples
will try to destroy it.

20:11.544 --> 20:13.379
That's why they
can never know.

never intersected
until now.

- He?
