WEBVTT

00:11.440 --> 00:13.000
First we have a note.

00:15.720 --> 00:17.200
Then we have a tune.

00:24.080 --> 00:26.280
Then we have a melody.

00:30.920 --> 00:34.400
Beethoven wrote this when
he first discovered he was going deaf.

00:35.640 --> 00:38.720
All that rage and fury,

00:39.560 --> 00:42.840
out of which, something beautiful.

00:44.760 --> 00:46.320
Am I boring you, Henry?

00:46.320 --> 00:48.800
- It's just a bit stuffy.

00:48.800 --> 00:50.400
Can't you play
something more exciting, sir?

00:50.400 --> 00:53.080
There is one thing you might like.

00:53.080 --> 00:54.560
It's called the Devil's chord.

00:54.560 --> 00:55.680
Tell me more, sir.

00:55.680 --> 00:58.520
It was banned by the church
in medieval times

00:58.520 --> 01:01.080
in case it allows
the Devil to enter the room.

01:05.240 --> 01:07.760
Makes you shiver, doesn't it?

01:07.760 --> 01:09.680
Technically, it's known as a tritone,

01:09.680 --> 01:12.600
but, uh, put it in context and, uh...

01:24.880 --> 01:26.200
Oh! Gosh.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.400
Oh, goodness me. Uh--

01:29.200 --> 01:30.200
What?

01:33.360 --> 01:34.720
Is someone playing a game?

01:41.640 --> 01:43.720
Ta-da!

01:48.880 --> 01:50.800
- Henry, get away from him.
Them.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.080
What?
- Me.

01:52.080 --> 01:53.600
What?
- I'm them.

01:53.600 --> 01:55.840
- You're who?
-"You're who?"

01:55.840 --> 01:59.240
Nice to see you again, kiddo.

01:59.240 --> 02:01.040
- You know each other?

02:01.040 --> 02:02.440
That's my daddy.

02:02.440 --> 02:03.600
Don't be ridiculous.

02:03.600 --> 02:05.120
You didn't look at my name, sir.

02:05.720 --> 02:07.080
Course I did.

02:07.080 --> 02:09.160
It's Henry-- What was it? Henry...

02:10.240 --> 02:11.920
"Henry Arbinger". That's it.

02:15.560 --> 02:17.640
Harbinger.

02:19.520 --> 02:22.160
Think of him as my prelude.

02:22.160 --> 02:26.080
And now his song is sung.

02:27.480 --> 02:28.840
Wh-- Who are you?

02:28.840 --> 02:33.640
My notation is Maestro.

02:33.640 --> 02:35.640
But what are you?

02:35.640 --> 02:38.480
I am...

02:39.840 --> 02:41.880
music.

02:43.800 --> 02:49.000
And you, Mr Timothy Drake,
you're a genius.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.080
Don't be ridiculous.

02:51.080 --> 02:55.920
You're the greatest composer
who ever lived.

02:57.160 --> 02:59.800
Clever enough to find the lost chord.

02:59.800 --> 03:04.680
But it's so sad, Timothy.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.720
You never had the luck.

03:08.320 --> 03:11.600
You never got that break.

03:12.200 --> 03:13.200
I did not.

03:13.200 --> 03:15.800
You're right.
No-Nobody ever understood me.

03:15.800 --> 03:22.640
All those melodies,
stifled and strangled inside you.

03:23.920 --> 03:30.480
All those songs you never sang,
they sit there still,

03:31.200 --> 03:38.000
wrapped around your heart, still beating.

03:38.760 --> 03:45.240
Wrapped so tight.

03:47.920 --> 03:50.560
Would you like me to set them free?

03:51.160 --> 03:53.800
I would love that, yes. Yes.

03:54.960 --> 03:59.480
Music, Maestro, please.

04:40.640 --> 04:41.880
Now.

05:30.200 --> 05:31.680
I wanna see

05:32.400 --> 05:37.880
The Beatles
recording their very first album.

05:41.680 --> 05:43.320
- Seriously?
- Well, you asked.

05:43.320 --> 05:45.120
If I could go anywhere in time and space,

05:45.120 --> 05:47.920
that's where I'd go because my mum,
she had a girlfriend, Claire.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.320
And I loved Claire,
and she was dead into vinyl.

05:50.320 --> 05:53.760
She had all The Beatles albums, so we
used to play 'em every day after school.

05:53.760 --> 05:55.160
Ten years old, I was.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.040
We had <i>Revolver</i>, the <i>White Album</i>--

05:57.040 --> 05:59.880
So, yeah, if I could go anywhere
then that's where I'd go.

06:03.360 --> 06:07.920
That is amazing.

06:07.920 --> 06:09.840
- Oh! Wait, seriously?
- Oh!

06:09.840 --> 06:11.760
- People always say the <i>Titanic</i>.

06:11.760 --> 06:13.720
- Or Mars. Or Bethlehem.
- Oh!

06:13.720 --> 06:15.880
- But The Beatles!

06:15.880 --> 06:18.280
- Why have I never done that before?

06:18.280 --> 06:19.760
- Come on!
- Oh!

06:21.280 --> 06:22.640
- Oh.

06:23.680 --> 06:25.720
February 11th, 1963.

06:25.720 --> 06:27.280
No way. Really?
- Mm-hmm.

06:27.280 --> 06:29.600
Whoo!

06:29.600 --> 06:31.040
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

06:31.040 --> 06:34.880
If we're in the '60s,
what about my clothes?

06:37.160 --> 06:38.880
Good thinking.

06:38.880 --> 06:40.560
Could give you go-go boots.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.640
Oh, I've got eyeliner!
- Oh, eyeliner!

06:42.640 --> 06:45.600
Oh, I want a beehive! I want a beehive!

06:45.600 --> 06:47.560
I've got wigs galore!

06:49.200 --> 06:51.720

07:16.040 --> 07:18.080
Hey, hey, hey!

07:18.080 --> 07:19.440
- Oh, no way!

07:19.440 --> 07:21.560
It's like the album cover!

07:21.560 --> 07:23.560
I am having the best time!

07:23.560 --> 07:25.760
Look at the cars.
- G-- Oh, come on!

07:35.520 --> 07:37.840
- Abbey Road Studios!

07:37.840 --> 07:39.440
Not called Abbey Road yet.

07:39.440 --> 07:45.280
Right now, in '63,
they are the EMI Recording Studios.

07:45.280 --> 07:47.480
Huh.

07:49.480 --> 07:51.240
And how do we get in?

07:51.240 --> 07:53.560
- Won't they ask who we are?

07:53.560 --> 07:55.240
Oh! Oh, oh, oh, oh.

07:55.240 --> 07:57.000
Hi.

07:57.000 --> 07:59.520
Janet said we could take over,
so you can have ten minutes off.

07:59.520 --> 08:03.280
Oh, right. Thank you. Very kind.

08:04.560 --> 08:08.160
Yep. There's always a Janet.
And everyone wants a cuppa.

08:08.160 --> 08:11.080
- Brilliant.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.360
Good morning.

08:16.360 --> 08:17.440
Cuppa tea?

08:18.160 --> 08:21.320
Uh, yeah.
Make it a strong one. Two sugars.

08:21.320 --> 08:22.840
- Uh.

08:22.840 --> 08:24.080
Boys, do you want anything?

08:24.080 --> 08:27.000
I'm all right for now.
Maybe something stronger later on.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.040
- What do you think, John?
- Now you're talking, Paul, lad.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.720
I just want a good night's sleep.

08:30.720 --> 08:33.720
You keep playing like that,
we'll all have a good kip.

08:33.720 --> 08:35.600
All right. Let's take it from the top.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.000
I thought the chorus--
Don't slide in the harmonies. Just hit it.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.320
Whatever you say, boss.

08:39.320 --> 08:42.640
Hurry up then, George.
Only getting paid seven quid a day.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.040
Uh, good luck.
Thanks, love.

08:47.720 --> 08:49.440
Roll to record.

08:49.440 --> 08:51.760
And a three, two, one.

08:51.760 --> 08:53.160
<i>♪ I've got a dog ♪</i>

09:24.320 --> 09:26.560
Hi. Don't mind us.
Just a cuppa tea.

09:26.560 --> 09:27.640
Okay.

09:28.520 --> 09:30.200
Going from the second chorus.

09:30.200 --> 09:32.280
Playing in the last four bars
of the verse.

09:32.280 --> 09:33.720
Good luck, Cilla.

09:33.720 --> 09:35.080
Don't let me down, Cilla.

09:35.080 --> 09:36.880
And a three, two, one.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.480

Oh, Cilla.

10:00.280 --> 10:01.280
Don't mind us.

10:02.520 --> 10:05.080
Roll to record.

10:20.640 --> 10:21.640
Look at them.

10:23.520 --> 10:25.040
Everything's gone dull.

10:25.960 --> 10:28.520
No one hums. No one whistles.

10:28.520 --> 10:30.000
No one taps their feet.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.440
I don't get it though.

10:32.200 --> 10:33.200
Music isn't...

10:34.280 --> 10:36.640
Like, you can't lose it
or steal it or kill it.

10:36.640 --> 10:37.720
It's just natural.

10:37.720 --> 10:40.800
You get music
when the wind blows through the trees.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.560
It's called aeolian tones.

10:43.080 --> 10:44.080
The music--

10:44.080 --> 10:48.280
Music is the highest form of thought.
If you take that away...

10:49.200 --> 10:51.320
Finland? That never happened.

10:54.000 --> 10:56.600
If music is gone,
that means everything is changing.

10:57.200 --> 10:59.560
The whole human race
is taking a different path.

10:59.560 --> 11:01.240
Okay, so what do we do?

11:01.240 --> 11:03.320
You take John Lennon.
I'll take Paul McCartney.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.760
Find out what happened
and when it happened.

11:07.120 --> 11:09.280
- Two cups of tea, my darlings.

11:09.280 --> 11:11.160
That's half a crown. Ta very much.

11:11.160 --> 11:12.640
How much?

11:12.640 --> 11:14.400
- That is outrageous.
- Outrageous.

11:14.400 --> 11:15.840
Take it or leave it, sweetheart.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.440
That is daylight robbery.

11:18.440 --> 11:23.200
Ooh. That's me.
Margaret Lockwood in <i>The Wicked Lady</i>.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.800
Now there was a woman.

11:25.480 --> 11:26.760
Statuesque.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.440
Uh, excuse me. Hold on, Paul.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.800
Um, could I just have a word?

11:30.800 --> 11:33.560
I've got a cup of tea for you.
Mr Epstein sent me.

11:34.760 --> 11:36.520
Okay. Um--

11:36.520 --> 11:39.560
Y-You are writing songs
for the band, yeah?

11:40.320 --> 11:41.720
They're not very good, are they?

11:41.720 --> 11:43.360
Oh. Uh.

11:44.720 --> 11:46.440
No. No.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.520
Great.

11:48.360 --> 11:50.200
That's great, lad.
That's how it should be.

11:50.720 --> 11:53.720
It's not like the old days when we had
waltzes and fandangoes and all that.

11:53.720 --> 11:55.680
But waltzes used to exist.

11:55.680 --> 11:57.560
When did they start becoming wrong?

11:58.360 --> 12:01.280
Don't know. Way back. '20s? '30s?

12:01.280 --> 12:03.200
Why? What happened?

12:04.320 --> 12:05.920
We started seeing sense.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.320
What we're doing here today
is the last gasp.

12:10.160 --> 12:12.200
If I can make a bit of money
out of cheap, old rhymes,

12:12.200 --> 12:14.400
then I can settle down
and get a proper job.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.280
It's embarrassing, singing.

12:17.280 --> 12:21.040
Just wanna finish the album, get back
to Liverpool and... [sighs] ...forget it.

12:21.640 --> 12:22.920
But you can't do that.

12:22.920 --> 12:24.760
Wh-- [chuckles] We need ya.

12:24.760 --> 12:27.400
What for? I'm no good at anything.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.400
But, Paul,

12:30.920 --> 12:33.160
see when it's just you on your own,

12:34.000 --> 12:38.600
don't you think
that there must be better songs?

12:38.600 --> 12:41.840
You know, songs that lift you

12:41.840 --> 12:45.320
and devastate you and-and make you soar.

12:46.120 --> 12:51.840
Songs that are-are tucked away somewhere
in-in secret in the back of your mind?

12:56.040 --> 12:57.680
How do you know that?

12:58.400 --> 13:00.200
I-- I just wanna go home.

13:02.720 --> 13:04.040
Forget this life.

13:05.800 --> 13:08.760
Just have me tea and go to bed
with a woman of me own, you know?

13:10.240 --> 13:11.400
It's all I want.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.080
But then, why do I wake up crying?

13:20.800 --> 13:24.440
It's like, sometimes, late at night,
I get this thought.

13:25.200 --> 13:29.800
Like, it's so far away, but it's a note.

13:30.680 --> 13:31.960
A single note.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.360
And then a second.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.720
And a third and fourth and fifth.

13:38.760 --> 13:43.600
And you put them together, and it feels
like the most holy thing on this earth.

13:45.520 --> 13:50.000
Like a G, then an E.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.040
And a G, maybe twice.

13:54.640 --> 13:55.640
And then C.

13:59.400 --> 14:03.000
And if you put words to it,
words right from your heart...

14:05.080 --> 14:10.560
<i>♪ I love you so much ♪</i>

14:45.160 --> 14:46.640
Don't waste me time.

14:48.560 --> 14:50.560
Do you know what you are
with your ideas, pal?

14:50.560 --> 14:53.240
Disgusting. You are disgusting.

14:58.880 --> 15:02.200
What the hell was that?

15:03.440 --> 15:05.280
Yeah, that's it, Vinnie. Nice and safe.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.560
I want that installed on the rooftop
like it is precious china.

15:08.560 --> 15:11.040
Easy, boys. Don't hit the wall.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.280
Right, let's head on up.

15:15.120 --> 15:19.200
Thing is, without music,
dance must be gone.

15:19.200 --> 15:20.800
No one dances anymore.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.320
I mean, can you dance without music?

15:22.320 --> 15:24.160
I mean, you can, but do you want to?

15:24.160 --> 15:25.760
And think about it, Ruby. Love songs.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.560
There are no more love songs anymore.

15:27.560 --> 15:28.640
Oh, my God!

15:28.640 --> 15:31.480
There's no more love songs
in the whole wide world.

15:33.200 --> 15:34.520
- Ooh.

15:34.520 --> 15:36.080
Old London Town!

15:36.080 --> 15:37.200
- Oh, is that smog?

15:37.200 --> 15:38.880
I thought they got rid of that
in the '50s.

15:38.880 --> 15:43.080
We had really bad smog
in December '62, but this?

15:43.720 --> 15:45.280
It's more like a darkening.

15:46.040 --> 15:47.840
The world is darkening.

15:47.840 --> 15:50.200
I live over there.

15:50.200 --> 15:51.960
You do what?
- I live over there.

15:51.960 --> 15:53.520
- What do you mean?
- Shoreditch.

15:53.520 --> 15:54.680
I'm there right now.

15:54.680 --> 15:56.480
Okay, you're gonna have to start again.

15:56.480 --> 15:59.720
In the past, right now,
I live in a place called Totter's Lane.

16:00.520 --> 16:03.040
1963, I parked the TARDIS in a junkyard,

16:03.040 --> 16:04.920
and I live there
with my granddaughter, Susan.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.600
- Ah. Wh--

16:07.160 --> 16:09.200
- Okay?
- Your what?

16:09.200 --> 16:10.440
- My granddaughter.
- Susan?

16:10.440 --> 16:13.480
We could go and have a look but,
you know, timelines.

16:13.480 --> 16:15.720
- Wh-- You-You've got children?
- I did have.

16:15.720 --> 16:17.120
I will have.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.200
Time Lords get a bit complicated.

16:19.200 --> 16:20.720
Yeah, but you've got a granddaughter?

16:20.720 --> 16:23.240
Like, now? Like, today?
Back in our time? My time.

16:23.240 --> 16:25.400
Where is she?
- I don't know.

16:27.320 --> 16:29.080
How do you not know?

16:29.080 --> 16:30.640
The Time Lords were murdered.

16:31.160 --> 16:34.520
Genocide rolled across time and space
like a great, big cellular explosion.

16:34.520 --> 16:35.680
Maybe it killed her too.

16:35.680 --> 16:37.520
Doctor. God.

16:45.440 --> 16:46.440
There we go, Doc.

16:46.440 --> 16:48.520
- Hey, Vinnie!

16:48.520 --> 16:49.800
Thank you very much.

16:50.520 --> 16:51.520
Come on.

16:51.520 --> 16:54.000
Bit of luck,
I'll have you whistling by sundown.

16:54.000 --> 16:58.040
Can't bear whistling, Doc.
All those horrible tunes. No, thanks!

16:58.040 --> 16:59.240
Well, all right.

17:06.680 --> 17:08.360
It's all yours, honey.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.840
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm--

17:10.840 --> 17:12.320
I'm not that good.

17:12.320 --> 17:15.200
Uh, you are, sweet. I've seen you.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.240
December '23. King's Arms.

17:17.240 --> 17:18.840
You opened with "One More Sleep"?

17:22.120 --> 17:23.520
Oh, I can't believe you were there.

17:23.520 --> 17:26.520
Ah. It all comes back to Christmas
with you, doesn't it?

17:26.520 --> 17:28.480
I need you to play again.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.240
But what for?

17:31.240 --> 17:34.440
At this moment in time, Ruby Sunday,
you are the only music in the world.

17:34.440 --> 17:37.240
Let's see what happens
if you bring music back.

17:38.400 --> 17:41.040
It's just-- No pressure.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.480
Okay.

17:45.320 --> 17:50.280
I wrote this for my friend Trudy
when a girl broke her heart.

17:50.280 --> 17:51.400
Mmm.

19:39.800 --> 19:41.080
Mmm.

20:01.680 --> 20:03.080
No!

20:04.320 --> 20:05.680
No!

20:29.800 --> 20:31.720
You called?

20:33.760 --> 20:35.320
That was the Giggle!

20:39.240 --> 20:41.120
- Hide!
Uh, do what?

20:41.120 --> 20:42.360
We've gotta hide!

20:42.360 --> 20:43.520
You never hide!

20:45.800 --> 20:48.200
I can't fight this thing.

20:48.200 --> 20:50.960
Okay.

20:56.680 --> 20:59.840
I heard music!

21:17.800 --> 21:23.640
<i>♪ Where are you? ♪</i>

21:26.360 --> 21:30.480
- Who was playing that piano?

21:31.640 --> 21:36.760
The chorus of ancient songs calls me...

21:36.760 --> 21:40.560
...Maestro.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.760
And who...

21:45.040 --> 21:47.240
...are you?

21:48.000 --> 21:51.760
Because I heard music.

21:54.840 --> 21:56.880
And music...

21:58.920 --> 22:02.280
...is mine!

22:21.440 --> 22:22.520
What?

22:24.880 --> 22:26.160
What?

23:19.120 --> 23:22.080
Sound and vision.

23:40.160 --> 23:42.200
Music.

24:08.680 --> 24:10.640
Wh-Who was that?
Were they inside the piano?

24:10.640 --> 24:12.320
- How can they be inside the piano?
- Okay.

24:12.320 --> 24:15.120
- The piano wouldn't work.
- Okay. Okay, okay, okay.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.200
Okay.

24:18.720 --> 24:19.920
You're scaring me now.

24:21.160 --> 24:25.080
That thing must be part of the Pantheon.

24:25.960 --> 24:27.840
Oh, God.

24:28.920 --> 24:31.040
Oh, Ruby, there are...

24:34.160 --> 24:38.480
vast powers beyond the universe.

24:39.400 --> 24:42.360
I told you, when we first met,
I said-I said, "The Toymaker",

24:42.360 --> 24:45.640
and defeating him took everything.

24:46.160 --> 24:48.120
- It ripped me in half.
- But you survived.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.960
It literally-- It tore my soul in half.

24:50.960 --> 24:53.520
I can't survive that again.

25:05.680 --> 25:09.680
The Toy-- The Toymaker said-- He said--

25:10.880 --> 25:11.880
He warned me.

25:11.880 --> 25:14.800
He said, "My legions are coming."

25:15.520 --> 25:16.680
"My legions are coming."

25:16.680 --> 25:19.720
- He said, "My legions are coming."
- But you made that silence with the sonic.

25:19.720 --> 25:20.960
- That worked, didn't it?
- Yeah.

25:20.960 --> 25:23.720
One trick. Once. That's all you get
with the gods.

25:23.720 --> 25:25.760
- Okay, so what do we do?
- I don't know.

25:25.760 --> 25:27.600
I don't know, Ruby. That is the point.

25:27.600 --> 25:29.760
- I don't know. I--
- No, but you always know.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.560
- I don't.

25:31.560 --> 25:34.040
The last time, I got lucky. Catch.

25:34.040 --> 25:35.800
One trick. Once.

25:36.760 --> 25:39.720
But this thing is stealing music.

25:39.720 --> 25:41.080
I mean, how the--

25:41.080 --> 25:42.600
How the hell is--

25:46.520 --> 25:48.000
- I'm sorry.

25:50.240 --> 25:53.040
But the power of these creatures
is so vast,

25:53.880 --> 25:56.280
the whole world could slide into the pit.

25:58.680 --> 25:59.680
Doctor.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.000
I know you're clever.

26:03.720 --> 26:04.880
I know that.

26:05.480 --> 26:06.960
But I've got news for ya.

26:08.280 --> 26:12.360
The world did not end in 1963.

26:13.320 --> 26:15.040
- Right.
- No, but it didn't.

26:15.040 --> 26:17.080
Okay? I'm living proof.

26:17.080 --> 26:18.840
- I was born in 2004...

26:18.840 --> 26:21.640
...and all my life,
I've had Beyoncé and Sam Fender

26:21.640 --> 26:25.000
and <i>Strictly</i> and tap dancing
and raves and--

26:25.000 --> 26:28.440
Oh, my mum sings "Danny Boy" at Christmas,
when she's drunk, to my gran.

26:28.440 --> 26:30.880
- And don't you see, Doctor?

26:32.160 --> 26:34.600
Music exists.

26:39.320 --> 26:40.520
Come with me.

26:45.640 --> 26:47.320
So when is it for you, back home?

26:47.320 --> 26:48.560
What time are you?

26:48.560 --> 26:49.920
June 2024?

26:49.920 --> 26:51.680
Uh, it's hard to keep track.

26:51.680 --> 26:52.880
But, yeah, I think so.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.560
- June? July?

27:00.960 --> 27:02.680
Well, have we done it? Are we back?

27:02.680 --> 27:04.520
2024. I've brought you home.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.640
This is what we're trying to stop.

27:54.240 --> 27:56.960
But this isn't real.

27:56.960 --> 27:58.680
This is--

27:58.680 --> 28:01.440
- It's just like a parallel universe.
- This is your time.

28:02.560 --> 28:05.800
This is your home
if Maestro isn't stopped.

28:12.560 --> 28:13.920
Where's my mum?

28:21.640 --> 28:25.800
I think without music,
the human race goes sour.

28:26.720 --> 28:28.760
Without any way of expressing
a broken heart,

28:28.760 --> 28:31.000
they go to war, without even knowing why.

28:35.640 --> 28:37.400
Then how am I still alive?

28:40.880 --> 28:42.480
Why don't I fade away?

28:42.480 --> 28:43.840
Because of me.

28:58.840 --> 28:59.920
- Boo!
What?

29:14.880 --> 29:18.240
Maestro, the Doctor.

29:19.560 --> 29:22.360
That was you in '63, wasn't it?

29:22.360 --> 29:24.720
Sweet cheeks.

29:24.720 --> 29:28.920
You stepped from one time to another...

29:30.000 --> 29:32.440
...like the Lord Temporal,

29:33.200 --> 29:37.800
who trapped my father
and bound him in salt.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.680
- Yes?
- The child of the Toymaker?

29:44.160 --> 29:47.040
I should thank you, Doctor.

29:47.040 --> 29:51.360
Daddy was so bad to me.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.640
<i>♪ Daddy was so mean ♪</i>

29:56.640 --> 29:58.320
<i>♪ Daddy was so tough ♪</i>

29:58.320 --> 29:59.960
<i>♪ Daddy daddied me ♪</i>

29:59.960 --> 30:01.400
<i>♪ And that was quite enough ♪</i>

30:02.320 --> 30:06.160
If he was a living game,
you are the essence of music itself?

30:08.040 --> 30:11.320
But what's the point?
You've destroyed the world.

30:11.320 --> 30:15.000
Music is gone. How is that a win?

30:15.000 --> 30:17.440
Not gone!

30:17.440 --> 30:19.920
Darling, hush!

30:28.960 --> 30:33.920
The sound of a nuclear winter.

30:34.960 --> 30:37.880
The purest music of all.

30:38.480 --> 30:40.000
Aeolian tones.

30:40.000 --> 30:42.160
Music without the need of people.

30:42.920 --> 30:48.600
And every song that goes unsung feeds me.

30:48.600 --> 30:51.880
I get stronger and stronger.

30:51.880 --> 30:54.720
Until I can reach out...

30:54.720 --> 30:58.120
...and steal the music of the spheres.

30:59.480 --> 31:02.960
Then the universe will stop turning.

31:02.960 --> 31:08.520
It'll keen in a minor key.

31:08.520 --> 31:12.040
Aeolian tones
across the whole of creation.

31:12.840 --> 31:17.440
And that lament will be
my symphony supreme.

31:18.280 --> 31:20.160
With all of life extinguished.

31:21.240 --> 31:23.040
I'm goin' solo.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.880
How did you enter this world?

31:24.880 --> 31:28.760
Oh.
That would be telling, babe.

31:28.760 --> 31:30.600
No, babes!

31:30.600 --> 31:33.120
Your father established
the rules of fair play!

31:33.120 --> 31:35.920
One thing that he would never do is cheat.

31:36.800 --> 31:38.560
So I have a right to know.

31:39.960 --> 31:41.320
A genius.

31:41.960 --> 31:46.760
A single, silly man
who found the lost chord.

31:49.640 --> 31:52.760
Which means a different combination
of notes would banish you?

31:52.760 --> 31:56.040
I said, "Genius".

31:56.720 --> 31:59.480
And you might be bright.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.160
And hot.

32:01.160 --> 32:03.760
- And...

32:03.760 --> 32:05.200
..."timey wimey".

32:05.200 --> 32:08.280
But genius?

32:08.280 --> 32:10.080
Oh, honey, I don't think so.

32:13.080 --> 32:14.360
What are you doing?

32:14.360 --> 32:17.160
- Everything resonates, Doctor, dear.

32:17.160 --> 32:18.920
Every atom hums.

32:18.920 --> 32:23.400
And anything that plays a tune is mine.

32:25.200 --> 32:26.560
Sing along, Doctor.

32:28.880 --> 32:31.040
Everybody!

32:34.080 --> 32:37.040
What is it? What's hap--
- Maestro!

32:37.040 --> 32:39.080
Controlling the TARDIS.

32:39.080 --> 32:41.720
But I say never.

32:41.720 --> 32:43.320
Never!

32:44.200 --> 32:45.440
Ruby!

32:48.840 --> 32:50.600
- Are we flying?
- Only just.

32:52.160 --> 32:55.880
The only thing I can do
is take us back to 1963.

33:02.440 --> 33:06.560
- Where's Maestro?
- Composing.

33:06.560 --> 33:08.920
- And the next tune might be deadly.

33:08.920 --> 33:12.160
I'm sorry.

33:12.160 --> 33:14.320
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

33:14.320 --> 33:15.680
Don't hate me.

33:20.080 --> 33:21.200
Okay, come on.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.760
Come on. Come on, come on, come on.

33:22.760 --> 33:24.440
Come on. Okay.

33:30.560 --> 33:31.960
Strange.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.800
- Did you break it?
- No.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.920
No, no, no, no, no. That's something else.

33:39.160 --> 33:42.440
- Okay.
- Right.

33:54.440 --> 33:58.720
Okay. If we can record the right tune on
the sonic, we can use this as a weapon.

33:58.720 --> 33:59.640
- Right.
- Yeah?

33:59.640 --> 34:01.160
- No, no, no, no.
- Oh. Oh, okay.

34:01.160 --> 34:03.240
We need to find the Notes of Banishment.

34:04.440 --> 34:07.000
Ah, John Lennon's guitar!

34:07.000 --> 34:08.720
That's gotta be a good start.

34:08.720 --> 34:09.920
Okay.

34:09.920 --> 34:12.320
- Okay, but don't you need to be a genius?
Uh--

34:12.320 --> 34:14.960
Oh, just-- No offence.
Just a musical genius.

34:14.960 --> 34:17.040
- Sometimes genius is just hard work.

34:17.040 --> 34:18.320
Yeah?

34:18.320 --> 34:20.600
If I can find the right notes.

34:22.160 --> 34:23.240
Wait a minute.

34:25.320 --> 34:28.960
There's 66 billion trillion
different tunes out there, but...

34:28.960 --> 34:30.200
No, but just wait.

34:31.480 --> 34:34.760
Can you hear that? That music?

34:39.000 --> 34:40.760
Whoa! No, no, no!

34:40.760 --> 34:41.720
Doctor!

34:41.720 --> 34:43.200
I thought that was non-diegetic.

34:43.200 --> 34:45.280
No, no, don't--

34:48.040 --> 34:49.520
Doctor!

34:49.520 --> 34:52.000
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

34:52.000 --> 34:54.000
No, no, no, no!

34:56.160 --> 35:00.480
Doctor!

35:00.480 --> 35:03.280
Wait! No, no, no, no!

35:13.640 --> 35:17.040
Put her down!

35:27.400 --> 35:30.400
Can't trick me twice, honey!

35:30.400 --> 35:32.560
- Then fight me!

35:32.560 --> 35:34.440
Huh? Leave her alone!

35:34.440 --> 35:41.280
But she's the only human left
with music in her heart!

35:43.800 --> 35:49.520
Playing lovesick songs
for heartbroken lesbians,

35:49.520 --> 35:53.800
and that just makes me hungry

35:54.400 --> 35:56.760
for all those delicious songs.

35:56.760 --> 35:59.880
Let me go!

36:01.400 --> 36:05.160
- That's right, pretty girl! Sing!

36:10.240 --> 36:11.560
Maestro.

36:11.560 --> 36:14.760
- Maestro, I am asking you. Just--

36:16.960 --> 36:18.160
What?

36:22.720 --> 36:23.960
That's wrong.

36:23.960 --> 36:25.720
What do you mean?

36:25.720 --> 36:30.440
There's a hidden song
deep inside her soul.

36:30.440 --> 36:31.880
- What is it?

36:33.960 --> 36:35.480
What?

36:36.440 --> 36:38.040
Ruby.

36:44.160 --> 36:46.080
What is this?

36:47.080 --> 36:48.640
Christmas.

36:49.360 --> 36:51.760
The music that was playing
the night that she was born.

36:54.800 --> 36:57.640
How could a song have so much power?

36:58.440 --> 36:59.960
And power like him?

36:59.960 --> 37:01.840
- Like who?
- The oldest one.

37:01.840 --> 37:05.360
On the night of her birth,
he can't have been there.

37:05.360 --> 37:07.520
- What for?

37:08.080 --> 37:11.280
- What for? What for? What for?
Who was there?

37:15.360 --> 37:17.240
Enough.

37:18.320 --> 37:21.920
- Whoa!

37:21.920 --> 37:23.200
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.320
- I've got you. I've got you.
- Okay, okay.

37:25.320 --> 37:29.000
What was it? What happened?
- It's all right. All right? It's okay.

37:30.120 --> 37:33.320
This creature is very wrong.

37:33.320 --> 37:39.720
And this-- this is very, very, very right.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.280
Do you know what this is?

37:44.480 --> 37:46.720
This is the famous Abbey Road piano.

37:48.280 --> 37:51.320
They call it the Mrs Mills Piano.

37:51.320 --> 37:52.800
Oho!

37:52.800 --> 37:53.880
Oh, she was a girl.

37:53.880 --> 37:57.080
We had some adventures, me and Mrs Mills.

37:57.080 --> 38:01.200
But this is the piano that The Beatles
will play on their greatest hits.

38:01.720 --> 38:02.840
"Penny Lane".

38:02.840 --> 38:05.280
"Lady Madonna". All from this.

38:06.240 --> 38:08.320
So I know that this piano is rattling

38:08.320 --> 38:11.320
with all the potential
to send you back to hell.

38:19.320 --> 38:20.480
Hmm.

38:25.600 --> 38:28.320
Music battle.

40:07.680 --> 40:08.680
Go on then.

40:10.720 --> 40:12.000
Do it.

40:14.160 --> 40:16.120
Can you find it?

40:16.120 --> 40:18.920
- The lost chord?

40:19.640 --> 40:23.640
- Are you enough of a genius?

40:23.640 --> 40:25.760
Oh, I would never call myself that,
Maestro.

40:26.680 --> 40:30.240
But I have lived, and I have loved.

40:31.880 --> 40:36.200
And I can only smile like this
because I have lost so much.

40:36.200 --> 40:37.520
I've experienced everything.

40:38.120 --> 40:40.760
Every single thing.

40:40.760 --> 40:43.160
And if that's where music comes from...

40:50.200 --> 40:52.080
...I can find the chord to banish you.

41:31.360 --> 41:32.360
One more.

41:36.880 --> 41:38.480
Just one more.

41:40.920 --> 41:43.720
