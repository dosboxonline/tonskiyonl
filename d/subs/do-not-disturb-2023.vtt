00:27.083 --> 00:30.000
I'm on meds. I mean, I need to be.

00:32.875 --> 00:36.750
I went through some hard times.
I quit my job at the ferry company.

00:36.833 --> 00:39.833
With the pandemic and all,
I've spent almost two years at home.

00:41.625 --> 00:45.666
What are you waiting for
to be the hero of your own life?

00:45.750 --> 00:49.458
Take a look at yourself from above.
How big are you?

00:52.000 --> 00:54.833
I'm so bored. I was fine on the ferry.

00:54.916 --> 00:57.958
Some people get seasick.
I guess I get landsick.

00:59.000 --> 01:02.750
People have been wearing masks.
It's uncomfortable, but I got used to it.

01:02.833 --> 01:04.875
I'm tired of sitting around at home.

01:04.958 --> 01:08.833
You gotta listen to yourself
and take care of your body in such times.

01:09.416 --> 01:14.000
There is a lady called Peri Sönmez
on Instagram. Her account is PeriWords.

01:14.083 --> 01:15.708
I especially like two of her videos.

01:15.791 --> 01:20.583
"Forgive Yourself, Adapt, and Accept"
and "Toxic Relationships? Never."

01:21.208 --> 01:23.375
I find them really helpful.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.833
Now, there is no one toxic in my life.

01:25.916 --> 01:26.750
GUIDE TO HAPPINESS

01:26.833 --> 01:29.375
I no longer talk to my friends
Salih and Bahri from the ferry.

01:29.458 --> 01:31.791
Toxic means poisonous. It's simple.

01:31.875 --> 01:34.250
You stop talking to people
who aren't good for you.

01:34.333 --> 01:37.000
It reminds me of
what Uncle Enver always says.

01:37.083 --> 01:41.208
"Wipe your ass with glass, you'll get cut.
Talk to simpletons, you'll lose it."

01:41.291 --> 01:45.291
I'm choosing to avoid people now.
I'm happy in my small world.

01:45.375 --> 01:47.916
I just want to do good things
for myself now.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.541
I'm sick of making others happy.

01:49.625 --> 01:50.458
LETITGOXINE

01:50.541 --> 01:51.541
That about sums it up.

01:51.625 --> 01:53.291
Yes, that about sums it up.

01:53.375 --> 01:56.083
Fine, you can start Monday night.

01:56.875 --> 01:57.875
Thanks.

01:58.375 --> 02:02.416
Alright, let's see how big you are

02:02.500 --> 02:05.375
when you put yourself in the center.

02:06.166 --> 02:08.916
Start if you are ready to adapt.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.875
Just take a deep breath.

02:11.958 --> 02:12.958
One.

02:14.458 --> 02:16.458
Take a deeper breath.

02:17.166 --> 02:18.166
And say it.

02:18.250 --> 02:21.000
-I…
-I…

02:21.083 --> 02:23.083
-…accept myself.
-…accept myself.

02:23.708 --> 02:25.541
Can you feel yourself adapting?

02:26.625 --> 02:28.416
-I'm unique.
-I'm unique.

02:28.500 --> 02:31.041
-I'm unique.
-I'm unique.

02:31.625 --> 02:34.916
Just say,
"I accept and approve of myself."

02:35.000 --> 02:36.916
INCOMING CALL
FOREMAN SALIH

02:37.500 --> 02:42.375
-I accept and approve of myself.
-I accept and approve of myself.

02:42.458 --> 02:44.833
When will you leave?
Don't be late on your first day.

02:45.791 --> 02:49.083
Mom, it's a night job.
Get out, please. I'm watching a video.

02:49.166 --> 02:52.625
Why are you taking deep breaths like that?

02:53.291 --> 02:56.333
-Am I not allowed to breathe?
-You keep moaning.

02:56.416 --> 02:58.583
I don't like the way
you've been acting, Metin.

02:58.666 --> 03:00.083
You don't take care of yourself.

03:00.166 --> 03:02.958
What is with you talking to yourself?

03:03.500 --> 03:06.458
-I'm talking to myself?
-Ask yourself the following question.

03:06.541 --> 03:09.458
Go on. Why are your teeth like that
after all these months?

03:09.541 --> 03:11.208
They will be fixed soon.

03:11.291 --> 03:15.083
It's a terrible time for this.
What if you get engaged?

03:15.583 --> 03:18.166
Look, think hard about Suhal.

03:18.250 --> 03:22.291
Her father helped you out from over there,
may God bless him.

03:22.375 --> 03:25.541
They are trying to do you a favor.

03:25.625 --> 03:29.625
The job is fine,
but I am not so sure about marriage.

03:29.708 --> 03:32.583
This girl is just right for our family.

03:32.666 --> 03:36.541
What would be the harm
in meeting the girl?

03:36.625 --> 03:38.791
I don't like being told what to do.

03:38.875 --> 03:41.625
But he helped you!
Nothing is ever good enough for you.

03:41.708 --> 03:45.958
Remember,
only you can set your boundaries.

03:46.541 --> 03:51.666
You need just one thing
to become a better version of yourself.

03:51.750 --> 03:53.708
-What is it?
-Yourself.

03:54.333 --> 03:56.541
She said, "Yourself." Not, "Your mom."

03:56.625 --> 03:57.625
Fine!

04:05.208 --> 04:08.666
KOMODOR HOTEL

04:20.041 --> 04:22.333
-Here is the laundry room.
-Yes, sir.

04:22.416 --> 04:25.750
If you need to get a towel or a sheet,
they are here.

04:25.833 --> 04:28.000
-Yes, sir.
-The girl will be here till the morning.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.583
Have a good one.

04:30.250 --> 04:31.250
Hello.

04:32.583 --> 04:34.708
-Why are you playing with it?
-The band broke.

04:34.791 --> 04:36.958
So what? Let's go.

04:43.583 --> 04:44.708
That's it.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.125
Don't walk around the rooms.

04:48.208 --> 04:50.208
If a guest arrives,
take water to their room.

04:50.708 --> 04:53.708
If they want anything else,
get it from the liquor store next door.

04:53.791 --> 04:55.166
Your weekly pay is 1,500 liras.

04:55.666 --> 04:57.166
That's all. Here.

04:57.791 --> 05:00.291
It's supposed to be Metin. It says Çetin.

05:00.375 --> 05:01.791
It says Çetin?

05:02.583 --> 05:04.750
This is your probation week, anyway.

05:05.250 --> 05:06.958
There is a tip box there.

05:07.041 --> 05:11.083
The guests will sometimes give you
10, 20, or 100 liras.

05:11.166 --> 05:13.000
-Will you put it in the box?
-I will.

05:13.083 --> 05:14.250
You will, my ass.

05:14.875 --> 05:16.666
So, 1,500 liras per week is enough.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.583
If it's the rule, I will.

05:18.666 --> 05:21.416
Steal it if you want, my man.
I couldn't care less.

05:21.500 --> 05:25.791
Back on the ship,
we used to collect tips in a box.

05:25.875 --> 05:27.500
And we'd share them. Tip box.

05:27.583 --> 05:31.458
We aren't on the ship anymore.
We've docked. We are on land now.

05:31.541 --> 05:34.791
I can't keep tabs on your tips.
Do as you please.

05:34.875 --> 05:37.333
You can all fight about it if you want.
I don't care.

05:37.416 --> 05:38.333
Yes, sir.

05:38.416 --> 05:41.125
Don't wander around the halls.
Don't eavesdrop on the rooms.

05:41.208 --> 05:44.041
What's the profile of our guests, sir?

05:44.125 --> 05:46.708
They are all upper-crust.

05:47.291 --> 05:49.625
-Good evening, Mr. Bahtiyar.
-Good evening.

05:49.708 --> 05:50.708
Give him room 103.

05:51.250 --> 05:54.291
Any new songs? We listened to you
all night the other day.

05:54.375 --> 05:56.666
No, sir. Sorry, no songs tonight.

05:57.708 --> 05:59.541
Can you bring me some water?

05:59.625 --> 06:01.000
Mr. Çetin will.

06:02.750 --> 06:04.000
I'm off.

06:06.625 --> 06:10.541
Hacer will come at 7:00 a.m.
Open the door for her if you lock it.

06:10.625 --> 06:12.500
How will I recognize Hacer?

06:12.583 --> 06:16.291
She'll say, "I'm Hacer."
Who else would come at 7:00?

06:16.375 --> 06:17.416
She is short.

06:19.625 --> 06:20.625
Give me your number.

06:21.958 --> 06:25.583
Mr. Cengiz, at a time
when I'm turning over a new leaf,

06:25.666 --> 06:27.791
thank you so much for your help.

06:27.875 --> 06:30.708
Thank the girl.
This is just probation, anyway.

06:30.791 --> 06:34.125
But you are trusting me
with an entire hotel, after all.

06:34.208 --> 06:36.375
What's the worst you can do?
Eat the walls?

06:37.041 --> 06:39.333
Nibble on the couches? What?

06:40.458 --> 06:43.291
Do you have any suggestions on smiling?

06:43.375 --> 06:45.916
Smile. Always smile.

07:00.083 --> 07:02.208
The first step is important.

07:02.708 --> 07:05.875
When you are starting a new adventure,

07:05.958 --> 07:10.791
be sure to show everyone that
you are ready to be your best version.

07:11.458 --> 07:14.833
You have prepared your body and your mind.

07:14.916 --> 07:17.000
Now, you are ready.

07:17.541 --> 07:21.583
Look, your eyes are bright,
and you are glowing.

07:22.083 --> 07:26.125
You are as light as a feather
and as strong as an oak.

07:26.208 --> 07:29.375
You don't get hurt, no matter what.

07:29.916 --> 07:32.291
-Give me your Peri word.
-I give you my Peri word.

07:43.041 --> 07:46.208
NO ENTRY WITHOUT A FACE MASK!

07:56.083 --> 07:57.083
Suhal?

08:00.041 --> 08:02.250
I'm Mr. Metin. I mean, Metin.

08:03.125 --> 08:05.708
Good evening. How are you?

08:05.791 --> 08:07.666
I'm fine. Welcome.

08:08.875 --> 08:10.125
Do you need something?

08:10.208 --> 08:12.458
I've started working at the reception.

08:12.541 --> 08:14.083
Well, congratulations.

08:15.041 --> 08:16.041
Thanks.

08:20.416 --> 08:24.375
-Are these machines automatic?
-Yes, they have timers. Programs, I mean.

08:27.833 --> 08:29.166
Incredible technology.

08:31.291 --> 08:35.083
Maybe I should say, "One day,
the robots will take over the world!"

08:39.958 --> 08:42.875
My teeth will be fixed soon.
The pandemic delayed the treatment.

08:43.458 --> 08:44.458
Okay.

08:48.000 --> 08:51.541
I haven't seen you before.
Your mom… You know Kezban?

08:52.333 --> 08:54.875
Mrs. Kezban…
I mean, I don't know your mom.

08:54.958 --> 08:58.166
But Nabi is her neighbor.

08:59.625 --> 09:01.458
Is she your aunt?

09:02.250 --> 09:04.666
-I know Nadi, the youngest brother.
-I'm his daughter.

09:05.250 --> 09:06.500
I used to work on ships.

09:07.291 --> 09:08.333
Ships?

09:10.166 --> 09:12.583
"Don't let people define you."

09:12.666 --> 09:15.916
"Look them in the eye
and scream out who you are."

09:16.000 --> 09:17.125
There was a video…

09:17.625 --> 09:19.333
Ships… I worked on ships.

09:19.416 --> 09:21.458
Ships? All the ships?

09:21.541 --> 09:22.708
No, I mean…

09:23.750 --> 09:24.625
The Queen Elizabeth.

09:25.916 --> 09:27.375
Cruise ship. Overseas.

09:27.458 --> 09:29.041
Not a ferry?

09:30.208 --> 09:33.416
We do internships on ferries for a year.
Then we go abroad.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.125
-Can I be honest with you?
-Sure.

09:40.208 --> 09:45.291
I know our mothers
talked about our marriage, but…

09:45.375 --> 09:46.750
Maybe we should…

09:47.333 --> 09:50.208
Can we not talk about that?
I need to dry the sheets.

09:50.291 --> 09:51.375
Of course.

09:52.208 --> 09:53.208
Mr. Çetin!

09:53.750 --> 09:54.750
I'm coming!

09:55.791 --> 09:57.208
Mr. Metin or Mr. Çetin?

09:58.166 --> 09:59.625
It's a typo.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.458
It's actually Ayzek.

10:02.041 --> 10:06.000
Maybe you remember the old TV show
The Love Boat. It's from there.

10:06.958 --> 10:09.583
Okay, when you decide on a name,
I'll call you that.

10:12.750 --> 10:16.083
-Alright. I'll be upstairs.
-I'll be downstairs.

10:16.166 --> 10:17.500
I didn't mean that…

10:17.583 --> 10:18.708
Mr. Çetin?

10:18.791 --> 10:22.291
He is still calling me Çetin,
even though it's a typo.

10:22.375 --> 10:23.708
See you around.

10:29.625 --> 10:33.208
-Mr. Çetin!
-It's Metin, sir. Metin.

10:33.291 --> 10:35.125
They got it wrong because I'm new.

10:35.208 --> 10:37.708
I got my water.
You were going to get it, but you didn't.

10:37.791 --> 10:40.083
I'm sorry. Could you put your mask on?

10:40.166 --> 10:42.958
-What?
-Your mask, sir. Like I'm wearing now.

10:43.041 --> 10:45.625
I don't wear masks.
Feel free to wear yours.

10:45.708 --> 10:47.250
Let me note down the water.

10:47.333 --> 10:50.500
I didn't get the jab,
but I also didn't get Covid.

10:51.083 --> 10:53.208
I got the jab, and I didn't get Covid.

10:54.333 --> 10:56.250
Maybe I wanna die.

10:57.333 --> 10:59.750
Sir, can you stand further away, please?

10:59.833 --> 11:04.333
Get me 400 grams of salted peanuts,
six beers, and a razor blade.

11:04.416 --> 11:09.875
I suppose you have kettles and water here.
I also need something like a washtub.

11:09.958 --> 11:11.750
What is something like a washtub?

11:12.333 --> 11:13.416
A washtub.

11:14.875 --> 11:19.041
Yes. Six beers,
salted peanuts, and a razor.

11:19.125 --> 11:22.583
-No, a razor blade. Like in a box?
-With moveable blades?

11:22.666 --> 11:25.458
No, just a razor blade.
Bring them and charge them to my room.

11:44.375 --> 11:46.958
LETITGOXINE

12:02.458 --> 12:03.750
Mom?

12:05.375 --> 12:06.375
Were you asleep?

12:07.166 --> 12:08.166
Look…

12:09.041 --> 12:10.833
You think this girl and I are suitable?

12:11.750 --> 12:14.458
Are you all kidding me?
Are you kidding me?

12:15.125 --> 12:18.875
Do you realize how pretty she is?
You think we're suitable?

12:21.458 --> 12:22.458
Why not?

12:25.208 --> 12:27.500
Alright. Stop doing things
without asking me.

12:28.291 --> 12:30.708
It won't happen. She is too pretty, Mom.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.416
Okay, go to bed. I apologize, sir.

12:35.583 --> 12:38.041
-This is Komodor Hotel, right?
-Yes, sir.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.208
Excuse me.

12:39.291 --> 12:42.916
I'm a single person, you know.
I'll leave in the morning.

12:43.875 --> 12:46.000
How do we do it, man? How much is a room?

12:46.083 --> 12:48.333
A single room is 200 liras.

12:48.416 --> 12:49.625
Right, 200 liras.

12:50.791 --> 12:53.291
Here you go.

12:56.583 --> 12:58.208
Can I get your ID, sir?

12:58.791 --> 13:01.875
Here's what happened.
I came here by coincidence.

13:02.708 --> 13:05.541
I'm coming from another city.
I have a long road ahead.

13:05.625 --> 13:08.375
Please make it work without an ID.

13:08.458 --> 13:09.333
Here.

13:09.916 --> 13:13.625
Take this. You know, it's for you.

13:13.708 --> 13:16.333
But we have a logbook, sir.

13:16.416 --> 13:17.750
Leave me out of it.

13:17.833 --> 13:21.625
You'll be doing me a favor, brother.

13:22.833 --> 13:24.291
But it's too much.

13:24.375 --> 13:26.833
Okay, let's put it here then.

13:28.583 --> 13:29.416
Just a sec.

13:29.500 --> 13:30.583
-Okay, take it.
-Huh?

13:30.666 --> 13:33.500
-Take it all for yourself.
-But it's 600 liras.

13:33.583 --> 13:36.333
-Where are you from, my man?
-From here.

13:37.583 --> 13:38.583
Well…

13:39.125 --> 13:41.000
Can you wear your mask?

13:41.083 --> 13:45.125
It seems to be the new thing.
People are wearing masks in their cars.

13:45.208 --> 13:47.791
But it helped me.
I got released, you know.

13:48.791 --> 13:51.958
They released me because of corona.
I'm so relieved.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.458
Even I can't understand myself.

13:55.541 --> 13:57.458
-Can I remove my mask?
-Sure.

13:57.541 --> 13:59.166
They released you? Who?

13:59.250 --> 14:02.958
I was in prison, you know.
I got released 'cause of corona.

14:06.958 --> 14:08.291
So, just one night?

14:08.375 --> 14:10.291
Yes, one night.

14:14.166 --> 14:15.000
Room 104.

14:15.083 --> 14:18.208
Thanks. You're the best.
You're a good guy.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.916
I try to be. I'm on probation tonight
as the night manager.

14:22.000 --> 14:22.958
Thanks.

14:24.000 --> 14:26.958
I parked my car across the road.

14:27.041 --> 14:28.083
-Your car?
-Yes.

14:28.166 --> 14:29.416
I'll keep an eye on it.

14:29.500 --> 14:31.708
-Thanks for the water.
-You're welcome.

14:32.250 --> 14:34.833
-The room is upstairs?
-Yes, and I'm down here.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.541
-Thanks.
-Thanks.

15:12.583 --> 15:17.041
No. No, darling, no.
It's all my fault, I agree.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.750
You guys handled it perfectly,
but I failed.

15:19.833 --> 15:21.625
Yes. Where are you?

15:22.291 --> 15:26.208
I hear some awful music.
Like what you listen to when I'm gone.

15:27.208 --> 15:29.875
Darling, I didn't call
because I didn't want to argue.

15:31.083 --> 15:33.958
Nothing, right. I want nothing.

15:34.500 --> 15:35.625
Nothing.

15:35.708 --> 15:38.375
It's all my fault. My fault.

15:38.458 --> 15:40.791
Darling Dora,
I admit I'm a difficult person.

15:40.875 --> 15:42.333
Okay? Good night.

15:42.416 --> 15:43.833
What? Huh?

15:43.916 --> 15:45.666
No, you…

15:45.750 --> 15:49.458
I didn't call you. You called me.
Please don't call again, okay?

15:49.541 --> 15:51.583
What? I'm nowhere!

15:54.041 --> 15:56.916
Everything has a consequence, right?
For sure.

15:57.500 --> 16:02.208
Sir, the liquor store made me pay in cash.
Could you repay me the 270 liras?

16:02.750 --> 16:05.625
I was thinking about
the awful music, sorry.

16:05.708 --> 16:07.666
-You got the razor blade?
-Yes, sir.

16:08.166 --> 16:09.166
Okay.

16:11.041 --> 16:13.083
Regarding the money…

16:13.791 --> 16:14.791
Can I pay you tomorrow?

16:16.333 --> 16:17.375
Can I be honest?

16:18.708 --> 16:21.958
I made a decision.
I have to express myself correctly.

16:22.500 --> 16:26.166
I believe you'll understand,
but can I tell you what I think?

16:26.250 --> 16:27.291
Go on.

16:28.958 --> 16:33.583
Sir, I'll be really upset
if you don't pay me back the 270 liras.

16:33.666 --> 16:36.125
Please don't take offense.

16:36.208 --> 16:39.750
If I bottle it up,
it will just turn into bad energy for me.

16:40.375 --> 16:44.500
Don't worry.
We will settle it tomorrow, Mr. Metin.

16:46.583 --> 16:48.458
You can call me Ayzek.

16:48.541 --> 16:52.208
Sir, I was a sailor.
So I'm a good judge of character.

16:52.291 --> 16:54.333
Sorry for being direct.

16:54.416 --> 16:57.500
-You're a good judge of character.
-Yes. 270.

16:58.083 --> 17:00.416
I'm on probation tonight,
so I don't wanna worry about it.

17:00.500 --> 17:01.333
Good night.

17:01.916 --> 17:04.416
Is it the Ayzek from The Love Boat?

17:04.500 --> 17:08.375
It is, sir. But the boat is gone now,
and only the love remains.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.541
We are on land now, Mr. Bahtiyar.

17:11.041 --> 17:13.666
Anyone can be a hotshot on land,
but the seas are hard.

17:13.750 --> 17:15.125
The seas make you a man.

17:15.750 --> 17:18.583
It takes balls to be at sea. Excuse me.

17:18.666 --> 17:22.791
I'm a bit direct
because of my past as a sailor.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.083
Again, I apologize.

17:24.166 --> 17:27.291
You made me laugh.
Don't forget the washtub.

17:29.125 --> 17:30.208
You'll shave.

17:34.500 --> 17:38.083
You'll go on a bender
with the beers I bought?

17:38.166 --> 17:41.458
If you screw me over,
I'll screw you over. You weasel.

17:46.791 --> 17:48.625
-There you are! My man.
-Yes, sir?

17:49.250 --> 17:51.375
Can I find anything to eat around here?

17:52.000 --> 17:54.833
You can find some cookies
in the liquor store.

17:54.916 --> 17:56.833
And there, a guy sells chickpeas and rice.

17:56.916 --> 18:00.375
Good, I'll check that out.
Can I bring you some too?

18:00.458 --> 18:04.583
I don't eat this late, sir.
I just eat some almonds and goji berries.

18:04.666 --> 18:07.708
-You do?
-I don't eat acidic foods.

18:07.791 --> 18:11.708
They say the bowels
are the body's second brain.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.208
Fine, I'll look for some offal.

18:19.750 --> 18:22.458
He is a decent human being. A decent man.

18:22.541 --> 18:24.250
He asks if I also wanna eat.

18:39.625 --> 18:43.041
-Welcome, Mr. Captain.
-I'm not a captain.

18:43.125 --> 18:46.416
I'm doing hospitality.
Food and beverage. F&B.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.583
Mate tea?

18:48.166 --> 18:49.166
Thanks.

18:50.250 --> 18:51.916
What are you doing? Drawing?

18:52.791 --> 18:54.125
-Can I see?
-Sure.

18:55.750 --> 18:58.375
I see. So it's like children's drawings?

18:58.458 --> 19:00.250
I'm just drawing away.

19:00.333 --> 19:03.375
-To pass the time?
-No, I have an exam coming up.

19:03.458 --> 19:04.666
A community center class?

19:05.666 --> 19:09.125
-Higher education. Mimar Sinan.
-Oh, Mimar… In Fındıklı.

19:09.958 --> 19:13.583
-Universities are hard.
-I'm just studying to hopefully enter.

19:17.000 --> 19:19.708
-What are you listening to?
-Aşkın Nur Yengi.

19:20.583 --> 19:22.083
Oh, right.

19:22.750 --> 19:23.791
Aşkın Nur Yengi.

19:23.875 --> 19:26.291
Her older sister lived in Kızıltoprak.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.416
She was doing… I remember, look.

19:33.250 --> 19:34.750
Anyway, I shouldn't distract you.

19:36.708 --> 19:40.083
Draw me sometime.
Do you do it by looking or from memory?

19:40.916 --> 19:43.375
I mean, you can do both.

19:43.458 --> 19:46.583
-Do you have something like a washtub?
-I have a washtub.

19:46.666 --> 19:49.833
Good. Mr. Bahtiyar asked for one.
I'll take it upstairs.

19:53.291 --> 19:55.250
Draw me sometime. From memory.

19:55.333 --> 19:57.208
I have so much ironing to do…

19:57.291 --> 20:00.083
I'm just kidding. I saw a rat pass by.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.000
-Where?
-It went that way.

20:02.083 --> 20:04.750
We have rats everywhere.

20:05.250 --> 20:06.291
They are back again.

20:06.375 --> 20:07.583
I'm off.

20:11.000 --> 20:11.916
You're very pretty.

20:12.000 --> 20:15.791
Those who think we are a match are insane.
I'm serious, not kidding.

20:15.875 --> 20:17.166
I agree.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.125
-Are you serious or kidding?
-I really think they are insane.

20:21.250 --> 20:23.083
I have so many other jokes.

20:28.916 --> 20:30.875
Thanks, good night.

20:33.375 --> 20:38.916
-Man! What can you do for me tonight?
-Go away. Don't piss me off.

20:39.000 --> 20:42.833
Alright, no problem.
Don't worry, no problem.

20:45.583 --> 20:47.250
Hey, fuck off!

20:49.333 --> 20:52.791
-I parked my car in front of the hotel.
-I'm here. It's safe.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.625
I'll eat over here.
Do you have any drinks?

20:58.708 --> 21:01.125
-What would you like?
-Ayran, soda… Give me anything.

21:01.208 --> 21:02.833
Metin! Come here, Metin!

21:02.916 --> 21:04.916
-God! Sir!
-Damn it!

21:05.000 --> 21:09.166
-What did you do?
-I cut myself, but I couldn't do it right!

21:09.250 --> 21:11.000
-Sit down. Press on it!
-Ambulance!

21:11.083 --> 21:13.458
Don't call the police. It's embarrassing.

21:13.541 --> 21:15.041
-How did you do it?
-Razor blade.

21:15.125 --> 21:16.958
You made me buy it!

21:17.041 --> 21:19.125
-Are you lightheaded?
-No.

21:19.208 --> 21:21.041
-He had beer.
-Is it bad?

21:21.125 --> 21:23.500
No. Love, bring a sheet or something.

21:23.583 --> 21:26.208
I wanted to die, but it's hard.
It's not easy!

21:26.291 --> 21:27.125
Okay, calm down.

21:27.208 --> 21:28.958
How could you do such a thing?

21:29.041 --> 21:31.541
-Did the bleeding stop?
-It will. You didn't cut deep.

21:31.625 --> 21:33.750
-Do we need to call the police?
-No.

21:33.833 --> 21:36.333
I'm the night manager.
They'll involve me too.

21:36.416 --> 21:38.458
Tilt your head back.

21:38.541 --> 21:39.625
Press on it, Metin.

21:39.708 --> 21:41.500
-Come, darling. Bring it.
-Come on.

21:41.583 --> 21:42.958
Bring it. Thanks.

21:43.958 --> 21:44.791
Press on it.

21:46.125 --> 21:49.416
-Suhal, what happened to your foot?
-What about it?

21:50.333 --> 21:51.291
Don't make a fist.

21:51.375 --> 21:52.916
I have to go. I left the iron on.

21:53.000 --> 21:56.833
-I couldn't do it. I bled everywhere.
-I'm tying it. Almost done.

21:56.916 --> 21:58.916
I'm sorry about it, guys.

21:59.416 --> 22:01.541
There. Are you okay?

22:01.625 --> 22:02.666
I'm not.

22:02.750 --> 22:04.333
Should we call an ambulance?

22:04.833 --> 22:06.750
No, no need.

22:06.833 --> 22:08.041
It shouldn't get infected.

22:08.750 --> 22:11.125
Whenever you are stuck in a dark thought,

22:11.208 --> 22:14.208
which is what we call
"negative frequency,"

22:14.291 --> 22:17.750
imagine yourself
running freely in a pasture.

22:17.833 --> 22:21.000
And whisper this to yourself three times,

22:21.083 --> 22:22.583
"I'm valuable."

22:22.666 --> 22:24.458
"I'm valuable."

22:24.541 --> 22:26.291
"I'm valuable."

22:26.791 --> 22:28.958
We all consider ourselves valuable. Right.

22:31.666 --> 22:36.208
Can you get him some bandages
and iodine tincture from the pharmacy?

22:36.708 --> 22:37.583
Okay.

22:37.666 --> 22:40.375
Are you in shock?
Do you get sick when you see blood?

22:40.458 --> 22:41.500
No.

22:44.125 --> 22:45.916
Have you ever run in a pasture?

22:47.250 --> 22:50.541
I spent my entire childhood
running in pastures, you know.

22:52.416 --> 22:53.958
It makes a huge difference, right?

22:54.708 --> 22:57.000
Sure.

22:57.083 --> 22:59.916
Go buy some stuff, and I'll wait with him.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
Okay.

23:15.125 --> 23:16.125
Um…

23:17.666 --> 23:19.375
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

23:19.458 --> 23:20.625
PHARMACY

23:20.708 --> 23:23.416
Could you wait there for just a second?

23:24.541 --> 23:26.166
I'm coming.

23:28.916 --> 23:30.250
-Let me close this.
-Um…

23:32.708 --> 23:34.375
Sorry, um…

23:34.458 --> 23:36.333
Before you close, could you give me

23:36.416 --> 23:39.000
some iodine tincture
and bandages for cuts?

23:39.083 --> 23:42.541
I'm not closing. I'm the night pharmacist.
Show me your cut.

23:42.625 --> 23:44.000
Are you from the hotel?

23:44.083 --> 23:46.750
Yes, I'm the night manager, but…

23:46.833 --> 23:49.375
There is no emergency.
It's for precaution.

23:49.458 --> 23:50.375
For the medicine box?

23:51.583 --> 23:54.250
Okay, then I can give you…

23:56.625 --> 23:58.250
I'll give you hydrogen peroxide.

23:58.333 --> 24:00.208
It's nothing serious.

24:00.291 --> 24:01.833
It's just an antiseptic.

24:01.916 --> 24:03.125
Oh, okay then.

24:03.208 --> 24:05.500
I'm adding iodine tincture and bandages.

24:05.583 --> 24:06.875
What else?

24:08.291 --> 24:10.208
-Cotton balls.
-Cotton balls, right.

24:12.375 --> 24:14.958
I'm Metin. I used to work on ships.

24:15.791 --> 24:17.458
It's okay. I'll charge the hotel.

24:18.208 --> 24:19.208
No need.

24:19.916 --> 24:23.750
I'm the night manager.

24:23.833 --> 24:26.416
I'll take care of the bill. How much?

24:26.500 --> 24:27.500
Ninety liras.

24:28.333 --> 24:29.333
Ninety.

24:31.833 --> 24:32.833
What's your name?

24:33.583 --> 24:34.583
Saniye.

24:36.208 --> 24:37.875
My nickname is Ayzek.

24:37.958 --> 24:40.583
From The Love Boat. Maybe you've seen it.

24:40.666 --> 24:44.041
You are an actor?
I haven't seen you in anything.

24:46.291 --> 24:47.958
I'll be out soon. Wait for me.

24:49.291 --> 24:50.208
Um…

24:50.291 --> 24:53.250
Because it's like a prison visit.
I'm kidding.

24:53.958 --> 24:55.000
See you!

24:56.083 --> 24:57.083
Have a good one.

24:58.875 --> 25:00.416
We are both on night duty.

25:03.708 --> 25:04.875
Saniye.

25:05.916 --> 25:08.083
Saniye would be a better match for me.

25:21.958 --> 25:25.416
There is blood on the sheets
and on the carpet near the bed.

25:26.166 --> 25:27.291
Listen, Suhal…

25:27.791 --> 25:30.083
I didn't know about it. Sorry.

25:30.625 --> 25:32.875
Is that so? Really?

25:33.958 --> 25:35.333
Too bad.

25:54.625 --> 25:57.208
I'm sick of everyone having an opinion.

25:57.958 --> 26:00.958
Is there no one with no opinions?

26:01.625 --> 26:03.375
We can cry and feel sad together.

26:03.458 --> 26:05.666
Or we can let go and sing songs.

26:05.750 --> 26:09.875
But no! Everyone has an opinion,
and they think it's amazing!

26:10.958 --> 26:13.875
I don't understand
how people know so much.

26:13.958 --> 26:17.916
Everyone holds the key and is looking for,
excuse my language, a hole to shove it in.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.541
Sir, please don't gesture with your hand.

26:20.625 --> 26:21.666
Gesture?

26:22.333 --> 26:23.458
Don't move it.

26:27.583 --> 26:29.208
Cherry juice. Increases blood production.

26:29.291 --> 26:32.541
It can't increase blood production.
Enough, for God's sake.

26:32.625 --> 26:35.958
I'm sorry, Mr. Davut.
This whole thing is ridiculous.

26:36.041 --> 26:37.083
It's okay.

26:42.166 --> 26:46.875
Sir, I'm sorry,
but such things happen to me as well.

26:46.958 --> 26:49.583
Our lives are similar. We're human.

26:50.291 --> 26:53.583
In those moments when life gets hard,

26:53.666 --> 26:57.000
I say to myself,
"Don't worry about it, Ayzek."

26:57.083 --> 27:00.708
"So what? You'll deal with it.
What's there to do? Never mind."

27:00.791 --> 27:03.458
So, I take care of it in my head.

27:03.541 --> 27:08.458
I think you should also give
the real Bahtiyar inside you a chance.

27:08.541 --> 27:10.166
What are you doing?

27:10.791 --> 27:13.541
Checking if it is wallpaper. It's paint.

27:14.375 --> 27:18.458
In short, listen to yourself, sir.

27:18.541 --> 27:21.791
Agree with yourself. In your brain.

27:22.333 --> 27:23.791
What did I just tell you?

27:23.875 --> 27:26.166
Alright, but it's not just my opinion.

27:26.250 --> 27:28.583
Are you on Instagram?

27:28.666 --> 27:31.833
Do you know the account PeriWords?

27:31.916 --> 27:34.250
It's in her videos. Take a look.

27:35.500 --> 27:38.416
A joyful morning to you, friends.

27:38.500 --> 27:43.666
Hello to the sun, the trees,
the birds, the bugs, and the blue sky.

27:44.375 --> 27:46.375
We'll do something different today.

27:46.458 --> 27:49.625
Turn it off, please.
I'm not in the mood for it.

27:49.708 --> 27:52.791
It's unbelievable.
What's this nonsense, for God's sake?

27:52.875 --> 27:55.041
What's "Hello to the blue sky," Metin?

27:55.125 --> 27:57.333
What, are we in Eurovision?

27:57.416 --> 28:02.083
Right, think about how Gökhan
from the band Athena was wronged.

28:02.166 --> 28:03.875
Yet, he didn't give up.

28:03.958 --> 28:06.666
And today,
he is still Gökhan from Athena, right?

28:06.750 --> 28:08.291
Without affirmations…

28:08.375 --> 28:13.250
Think about where Gökhan from Athena is
as opposed to some of our old artists.

28:13.333 --> 28:16.791
Look, there are
thousands of stupid videos like this.

28:16.875 --> 28:19.500
Please don't watch them. They poison you.

28:20.750 --> 28:24.250
We have more doctors than patients.
Everyone is a therapist.

28:24.333 --> 28:27.541
Sir, is this your phone ringing?
Dora is calling.

28:28.291 --> 28:30.416
Put it down.
That phone doesn't concern you.

28:31.958 --> 28:32.958
Sir.

28:34.208 --> 28:35.083
Look.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.708
Your phone looks pristine.
And look at mine.

28:37.791 --> 28:39.750
It's a simple equation.

28:40.708 --> 28:45.333
Why would someone
with a pristine phone want to die?

28:46.125 --> 28:47.291
No response, right?

28:48.208 --> 28:51.041
Metin, could you find me a rope?

28:53.000 --> 28:57.666
Mr. Bahtiyar, I'll bring you
some of my wonderful mate tea.

28:57.750 --> 29:01.208
You'll drink it and sleep like a baby.

29:01.291 --> 29:03.125
And you'll remember what in the morning?

29:03.208 --> 29:05.375
To say hi to the blue sky?

29:05.458 --> 29:08.833
No, to pay my 270 liras, alright?

29:10.666 --> 29:14.500
Look, I'm 50 years old,
and my weekly pay is 1,500 liras.

29:14.583 --> 29:16.458
And Mr. Davut will be mad.

29:16.541 --> 29:18.500
So, please.

29:18.583 --> 29:22.916
Nobody can abandon ship
when I'm on duty, alright?

29:23.625 --> 29:26.250
Metin, come.
I have something important to ask you.

29:26.333 --> 29:27.458
At your service, sir.

29:27.541 --> 29:30.458
Look, I'll pay you to choke me to death.

29:31.250 --> 29:32.708
Please end it, Metin.

29:32.791 --> 29:35.958
Mr. Bahtiyar,
I swear I'll call the police.

29:36.708 --> 29:39.458
I'll bring you
your mate tea to drink, alright?

29:45.791 --> 29:47.833
-What happened? What did he say?
-Well…

29:49.083 --> 29:51.000
He can't think clearly.

29:51.583 --> 29:55.208
But I gave him a good talking-to.
He calmed down, and now he'll sleep.

29:55.291 --> 29:57.250
Metin, don't call the police.

29:57.333 --> 30:00.708
I'm here, anyway.
Fuck him. Just let him sleep.

30:00.791 --> 30:04.083
These people think dying is like fainting.

30:04.166 --> 30:07.833
Okay, don't call the police.
Take this. Put it in your pocket.

30:08.750 --> 30:11.416
-I'll be around too.
-Alright. Is he drunk?

30:12.500 --> 30:15.875
He got six beers but only drank about two.

30:15.958 --> 30:18.250
-Take the rest from his room.
-Huh?

30:18.333 --> 30:21.875
-Take them from his room.
-I'll return them to the liquor store.

30:21.958 --> 30:23.500
-He shouldn't drink.
-Okay.

30:23.583 --> 30:24.791
-Go on.
-Alright.

30:48.666 --> 30:49.750
What are you doing?

30:49.833 --> 30:52.208
-What's up?
-You were just here.

30:52.291 --> 30:55.875
I wanted to exchange these for cold ones,
but the store is closed.

30:55.958 --> 30:59.000
-Are you drinking Coke?
-Would you like some?

30:59.083 --> 31:00.666
No, Coke is acidic.

31:00.750 --> 31:04.375
I'm on a diet where I only eat
six almonds and nothing else after 8:00.

31:05.291 --> 31:06.583
Good luck with that.

31:06.666 --> 31:08.583
-Give me a song.
-What?

31:08.666 --> 31:11.166
-Give me a song to play.
-I should go to work.

31:11.958 --> 31:15.541
Do you remember the movie
where the guy visits his older brother

31:15.625 --> 31:17.250
in the pharmacy warehouse?

31:17.333 --> 31:19.750
-We're like that.
-With Mazhar Alanson!

31:19.833 --> 31:23.333
His brother comes
and asks if he'd like some ice cream.

31:24.000 --> 31:26.166
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

31:34.208 --> 31:36.833
What's up, baby? Sorry.

31:59.083 --> 32:00.250
Saniye?

32:00.333 --> 32:03.125
The pharmacist lady.
I got gauze bandages and stuff.

32:05.000 --> 32:06.583
What happened to Mr. Bahtiyar?

32:09.791 --> 32:12.833
He was far gone. But I gave him
some advice, and he is better.

32:13.625 --> 32:16.416
-You gave Mr. Bahtiyar some advice?
-Can't I?

32:18.458 --> 32:21.250
-Wow, that's something.
-What do you mean?

32:22.958 --> 32:25.166
Do you know
that Mr. Bahtiyar teaches literature?

32:25.250 --> 32:28.583
Really? So I should have done what?
Read him a poem?

32:30.083 --> 32:31.708
He is a professor, Mr. Ayzek.

32:34.666 --> 32:37.000
You wanna compare me and him?

32:39.333 --> 32:43.083
I checked out The Love Boat.
Why call yourself Ayzek? He is Black.

32:43.666 --> 32:46.125
Think about it.

32:49.750 --> 32:51.000
He is in a bad place.

32:51.708 --> 32:54.916
He quits teaching, starts to make music.

32:55.000 --> 32:59.041
Then corona hits,
and he struggles hard for two years.

32:59.125 --> 33:02.250
I think he also has family issues.
I saw him here a few times.

33:02.958 --> 33:05.500
What did you watch?
The Love Boat is nothing like that.

33:05.583 --> 33:09.500
I'm talking about Mr. Bahtiyar.
It seems the pandemic has affected him.

33:09.583 --> 33:11.625
The divorce rate increased during it.

33:12.541 --> 33:13.708
Nobody has money.

33:16.500 --> 33:18.333
-He offered me money.
-Who?

33:19.291 --> 33:20.333
Bahtiyar.

33:20.916 --> 33:21.958
For what?

33:23.541 --> 33:27.083
He said, "I'll pay you
this much money to kill me."

33:27.666 --> 33:29.833
-Stop joking.
-I'm serious.

33:29.916 --> 33:32.375
Don't say things like that
to look interesting.

33:32.458 --> 33:33.458
It's true.

33:36.125 --> 33:37.500
How much did he offer?

33:38.416 --> 33:39.833
Not a huge amount.

33:39.916 --> 33:43.750
He owes me 270 liras too.
And I couldn't return the beers.

33:44.250 --> 33:45.833
Such high figures!

33:47.333 --> 33:50.583
-Anyway, don't kill him.
-Do I look like I would?

33:51.333 --> 33:52.500
Absolutely.

33:53.125 --> 33:54.416
Have you seen Joker?

33:54.500 --> 33:57.958
-No. Is that a compliment?
-No.

33:58.041 --> 33:59.166
Why did you smile, then?

34:00.000 --> 34:02.166
I said, "You look like you would,"
and smiled.

34:02.250 --> 34:03.250
Really?

34:04.125 --> 34:05.791
That's fine, pretty girl.

34:05.875 --> 34:08.250
Works for me. It's okay if you think so.

34:09.083 --> 34:12.375
Don't forget to draw me.
Draw my profile to hide my baldness.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.208
God…

34:16.208 --> 34:18.625
Everyone is looking for an adventure.

34:18.708 --> 34:20.083
She says I could kill him!

34:21.916 --> 34:22.916
It's okay if you think so.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.375
Ma'am!

34:25.458 --> 34:28.041
-Hey, what is going on?
-What are you doing?

34:28.125 --> 34:30.750
-Ma'am, open the door!
-Hey!

34:30.833 --> 34:33.125
-I'm calling the police.
-Give me medicine!

34:33.208 --> 34:35.833
-What is going on?
-Ms. Saniye!

34:35.916 --> 34:38.041
-Give me just one!
-I called the police. Leave.

34:38.125 --> 34:40.000
-Get down!
-Fuck off!

34:40.083 --> 34:41.916
-Hey, get down!
-Look.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.541
-We are all neighbors!
-Stay out of it, Ayzek.

34:44.625 --> 34:45.708
What are you doing? Move!

34:45.791 --> 34:47.583
-Go inside.
-Don't talk to him!

34:47.666 --> 34:49.291
-You got a problem?
-Who are you?

34:49.375 --> 34:51.250
-You got a problem?
-It's a fucking massacre!

34:51.333 --> 34:52.875
-Leave!
-No, please.

34:52.958 --> 34:55.041
He'll shout a bit and leave.
He is an addict.

34:55.125 --> 34:57.250
Wait. Go in and lock the door.

34:57.333 --> 34:58.958
-The police are on the way.
-Okay.

34:59.041 --> 35:00.750
-You got a problem?
-Who are you?

35:00.833 --> 35:01.666
Ayzek!

35:01.750 --> 35:03.458
Come here. Talk to me.

35:04.125 --> 35:05.833
-Suhal, go inside.
-Come here!

35:05.916 --> 35:07.375
Go in. Lock the door.

35:07.458 --> 35:09.791
-Tell me your problem.
-The fucking antichrist is here.

35:09.875 --> 35:11.583
-Piss off!
-Please!

35:11.666 --> 35:12.916
-It's okay.
-Ayzek!

35:13.458 --> 35:14.958
Stay away from him!

35:15.041 --> 35:16.708
Suhal, get inside!

35:16.791 --> 35:19.500
Suhal, get inside my heart!

35:19.583 --> 35:21.375
Boy, you're pissing me off!

35:21.458 --> 35:24.541
What did you say?
I'll slap the hell out of you!

35:24.625 --> 35:26.458
-Mr. Metin!
-It's okay.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.416
-He is insane.
-What is happening?

35:28.916 --> 35:30.666
They are about to fight.

35:30.750 --> 35:33.583
-Suhal! Get inside my heart!
-Go away!

35:33.666 --> 35:35.291
It's fine. Come inside.

35:36.583 --> 35:37.625
Suhal, get inside!

35:39.250 --> 35:42.041
Boy, what did you say?

35:42.125 --> 35:46.416
-Break my teeth!
-What? Go away. Don't come here.

35:48.583 --> 35:50.166
They are here.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.916
You can't stop a bad guy.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.083
-I'll fuck you up.
-Hey!

35:55.166 --> 35:56.791
He stabbed him. Off he goes.

35:57.375 --> 35:59.833
-I told you to stay away.
-It's fine.

35:59.916 --> 36:01.291
Are you okay?

36:01.375 --> 36:02.500
It's fine!

36:03.250 --> 36:05.875
I warned you. Why did you talk to him?

36:05.958 --> 36:07.208
-What happened?
-It's fine.

36:07.291 --> 36:10.375
-Çarli stabbed him.
-Are you okay? Let's go to the hospital.

36:10.458 --> 36:13.416
No, it's fine.
I'm the night manager there.

36:13.500 --> 36:16.083
He was bothering the lady, so I wanted to…

36:16.166 --> 36:18.625
-Çarli? We'll arrest him.
-Thanks.

36:18.708 --> 36:20.708
I didn't really do anything.

36:20.791 --> 36:23.166
-Let's check it inside.
-Let's go.

36:23.250 --> 36:24.750
You don't need to come.

36:24.833 --> 36:27.125
-God, he stabbed me out of nowhere.
-Ayzek?

36:27.208 --> 36:29.041
I knew it would happen.

36:29.791 --> 36:33.083
-Let's go to the hospital.
-Ms. Saniye will take care of it.

36:33.666 --> 36:35.583
Go to the hotel. I'll take care of it.

36:36.291 --> 36:37.291
She will.

36:37.875 --> 36:39.416
-God…
-Go on.

36:39.500 --> 36:42.250
-God…
-They are animals.

36:42.333 --> 36:44.583
Where did he have the knife?

36:45.458 --> 36:46.958
It's a deep wound.

36:47.041 --> 36:49.500
Go in and take off your pants. I'm coming.

36:49.583 --> 36:50.583
My pants…

36:51.416 --> 36:57.041
And I just bought cotton balls
and iodine tincture from you!

36:58.208 --> 36:59.541
Go in. I'm coming.

37:00.125 --> 37:02.000
You think it's necessary?

37:03.750 --> 37:06.333
-Lie down, take off your pants.
-Well…

37:08.791 --> 37:11.416
-Let me see.
-Good God…

37:11.500 --> 37:12.958
If you don't mind…

37:13.458 --> 37:14.958
Your undies too.

37:16.500 --> 37:19.875
There is a lot of blood.
I'll clean it now, okay?

37:20.458 --> 37:22.333
I didn't even feel it.

37:22.416 --> 37:24.750
Don't worry, you don't need stitches.

37:24.833 --> 37:25.750
It's fine.

37:25.833 --> 37:27.666
-See, it's fine.
-Okay.

37:27.750 --> 37:28.666
All good.

37:28.750 --> 37:30.083
I'm on probation too.

37:32.333 --> 37:33.375
Can I get dressed?

37:34.708 --> 37:35.958
Nice butt.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.875
Ms. Saniye, I'm 50 years old.

37:39.416 --> 37:42.750
It looks 40. Do you work out?

37:43.541 --> 37:46.291
No, I just do a little boxing
and stretching.

37:49.250 --> 37:51.666
Let me apply this.

37:51.750 --> 37:54.458
Oh! This is my song!

37:54.541 --> 37:56.250
-Well…
-I love it! God!

37:56.916 --> 37:58.166
Can I get dressed?

38:08.000 --> 38:10.750
Funda, you are the bomb, girl!

38:14.500 --> 38:16.375
-Here you go.
-But…

38:16.458 --> 38:17.458
Drink it.

38:18.083 --> 38:19.500
Enjoy.

38:22.208 --> 38:24.541
Just one second, and I'll be done.

38:24.625 --> 38:27.583
I mean… You put gin in it.

38:31.958 --> 38:35.000
I'm almost done.
It's all good, don't worry.

38:35.083 --> 38:36.833
-Can I get dressed?
-Alright.

38:36.916 --> 38:37.916
Okay.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.416
Okay, there are some wet wipes there.

38:47.500 --> 38:48.666
Do you own the pharmacy?

38:49.750 --> 38:52.583
Yes, but I'm leaving in three months.
Terrible neighborhood.

38:53.416 --> 38:56.500
They are all terrible.
And those immigrants…

38:57.250 --> 38:58.333
Yes?

38:58.416 --> 39:01.125
Nothing. I just said, "Immigrants,"
and did this.

39:02.041 --> 39:04.500
Oh. Anyway, let's clink glasses.

39:05.916 --> 39:08.041
Go on. What show are you on?

39:09.208 --> 39:13.458
I'm not on it.
My name is from an old show. Ayzek.

39:13.541 --> 39:17.833
Oh, I thought you were an actor!
Everyone's on a show these days.

39:18.541 --> 39:20.708
You need a casting agency for that.

39:21.333 --> 39:23.791
I… I just love the sea.

39:24.791 --> 39:27.000
I work on ships as a captain.

39:27.083 --> 39:28.541
What about the hotel?

39:28.625 --> 39:32.916
We're just trying it today.
An acquaintance put us in contact.

39:33.000 --> 39:35.291
They think I can run it.
We'll try and see.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.958
You made me drink gin.

39:39.041 --> 39:40.708
Enjoy.

39:40.791 --> 39:42.625
I only eat alkaline foods.

39:43.291 --> 39:46.083
Oh? So you know about alkalis, huh?

39:46.166 --> 39:50.083
Sure. I'm following PeriWords
on Instagram.

39:50.166 --> 39:53.250
Alkalis. Food intolerance.

39:53.833 --> 39:56.333
Intermittent fasting. Outside of Ramadan.

39:56.416 --> 39:57.916
And heavy metals.

39:58.541 --> 40:02.166
But heavy metals entered my body
when I got stabbed. Broke the diet.

40:03.625 --> 40:04.625
Look at you!

40:07.625 --> 40:09.125
My teeth will be fixed soon.

40:10.125 --> 40:12.000
It's unbearable otherwise.

40:12.916 --> 40:15.958
-My teeth?
-This work! Let's clink glasses.

40:17.083 --> 40:18.833
To the hero of the night.

40:18.916 --> 40:22.083
I shouldn't drink. I have to work.

40:23.166 --> 40:24.875
Stay until the song ends, okay?

40:26.791 --> 40:29.041
It's a duet, right? It is two people.

40:30.958 --> 40:32.250
It is two people.

40:39.041 --> 40:42.541
-See you, Saniye. Kisses.
-See you. Take care.

40:47.166 --> 40:49.166
-Why are you here?
-I just am.

40:49.791 --> 40:52.208
-Are you okay?
-I'm okay.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.000
Good God…

40:58.458 --> 40:59.750
You can lean on me.

41:07.708 --> 41:09.833
-Can you use your leg?
-I can.

41:11.708 --> 41:14.458
-Did he stab your leg?
-No, above my leg.

41:21.708 --> 41:23.125
It will be fine.

41:26.125 --> 41:28.500
He is always around here.

41:36.791 --> 41:39.250
-What happened? Get well soon.
-You won't believe it.

41:40.291 --> 41:41.291
I'm fine.

41:45.375 --> 41:47.250
I didn't even say anything to him.

41:48.500 --> 41:50.375
-I mean…
-Careful.

41:50.875 --> 41:54.166
-Get well soon. Is it bad?
-No, it's fine.

41:54.250 --> 41:58.333
It's okay. It's just some drug addict.

41:58.875 --> 42:02.083
He would screw his parents over
for a pill.

42:02.666 --> 42:05.625
The lady was alone.
I slapped him, and he stabbed me. See?

42:06.333 --> 42:09.250
-Yes. I'll get you spare pants.
-It's fine.

42:09.333 --> 42:11.416
It's nothing.
Consider it your lucky charm.

42:11.500 --> 42:13.666
This is nothing. Nothing at all!

42:13.750 --> 42:16.708
I came to you,
but she closed the shutters in my face.

42:18.083 --> 42:20.208
What was there to do? Stop it now.

42:20.291 --> 42:22.916
-Let's get your spares.
-Look at the size of the hole.

42:23.000 --> 42:23.958
Let's go.

42:24.041 --> 42:27.791
I'll change and come back.
All this on my probation day!

42:33.500 --> 42:35.041
Give me the pants.

42:36.750 --> 42:39.208
-Can I take them off here?
-Okay.

42:44.583 --> 42:46.291
All this in the middle of the night.

42:48.333 --> 42:50.291
-Sorry.
-Here.

42:50.375 --> 42:51.625
God…

42:52.250 --> 42:53.750
It's a huge hole.

42:53.833 --> 42:55.833
Ms. Saniye said
there is no need for stitches.

42:55.916 --> 42:59.166
She should mind her own business.
They are ripped. They do need stitches.

42:59.250 --> 43:01.958
-Take off your underwear too.
-Yeah, they are really bad.

43:02.041 --> 43:05.291
Wait, I have three pairs
that guests left behind.

43:06.000 --> 43:09.250
-And wear someone else's underwear?
-They are washed and clean.

43:09.333 --> 43:12.250
How do people leave
their underwear behind? I don't get it.

43:12.333 --> 43:14.291
I'll wear them inside out.

43:14.375 --> 43:16.333
I'll wash them for you. Take them off.

43:16.416 --> 43:18.750
I can't make you wash my underwear.

43:19.250 --> 43:20.750
What is going on?

43:20.833 --> 43:22.666
Enough, for God's sake.

43:24.500 --> 43:25.500
Jeez…

43:27.375 --> 43:29.875
Everybody wants me
to take my undies off today.

43:29.958 --> 43:31.083
It's probation day!

43:45.000 --> 43:47.833
What is it, Mr. Bahtiyar?
What are you up to now?

43:47.916 --> 43:49.916
I heard a fight. Is everything okay?

43:50.000 --> 43:52.875
It is. Just some thugs.
What, are you leaving?

43:52.958 --> 43:55.291
I'd like a word in private, Metin.

43:55.375 --> 43:58.125
-Let's sit and talk for a bit.
-I can't sit, but okay.

43:58.208 --> 43:59.208
Let's go.

44:03.333 --> 44:04.333
So?

44:05.291 --> 44:08.250
Yes. I thought about what you said.

44:08.333 --> 44:12.125
-Look, we are strangers after all.
-Yes.

44:12.208 --> 44:15.041
Us being strangers is an advantage.

44:15.125 --> 44:19.666
We can tell each other
what we can't tell our closest loved ones.

44:20.541 --> 44:22.041
Where are you going with this?

44:23.166 --> 44:26.458
-I'd like to make a proper offer.
-Go ahead.

44:29.083 --> 44:30.083
Look.

44:31.041 --> 44:34.416
This saxophone is worth
8,000 to 10,000 dollars.

44:34.500 --> 44:37.583
It has a great mechanism.
Even the wind can play it.

44:38.291 --> 44:39.291
Wow.

44:40.125 --> 44:41.291
This is my offer.

44:41.875 --> 44:45.000
This instrument is my life,
my closest friend.

44:45.083 --> 44:48.541
-It belongs to your closest friend?
-No, it is my closest friend.

44:50.625 --> 44:52.625
You're offering 8,000 to 10,000 dollars?

44:54.250 --> 44:56.375
And you want me to do
what you asked before?

44:56.458 --> 44:57.458
Please.

45:00.791 --> 45:03.125
I could sell it in Tünel.

45:03.916 --> 45:08.583
Or do you think I'll try to play it,
fail, and then go sell it?

45:10.208 --> 45:13.250
Please make sure a worthy person buys it.

45:13.333 --> 45:16.625
Sure, I'll research him first.
I'll even keep tabs on the guy.

45:21.500 --> 45:23.041
I want your phone too.

45:23.125 --> 45:25.541
It's better for me in this mission.

45:25.625 --> 45:26.833
Okay.

45:26.916 --> 45:29.541
-Go on.
-Let me bring it from my room.

45:29.625 --> 45:30.625
Wait.

45:32.041 --> 45:36.458
I'll take care of your problem,
but don't tell anyone.

45:36.541 --> 45:39.083
I'll set the place and time, okay?

45:39.166 --> 45:43.416
Don't act out or harm yourself, okay?

45:43.500 --> 45:44.500
Okay.

45:52.208 --> 45:54.583
-What's this?
-A failed attempt.

45:55.125 --> 45:56.583
You're paying for the lamp.

45:58.375 --> 45:59.375
Give me your phone.

46:01.750 --> 46:04.583
-You want the case?
-Nah, keep it.

46:05.583 --> 46:08.750
Yes. Let's leave the room.
It's too depressing.

46:09.458 --> 46:11.958
We'll play by my rules now, okay?

46:12.041 --> 46:13.250
-Give me your word.
-Okay.

46:13.333 --> 46:14.375
I can't hear you.

46:14.458 --> 46:15.791
-You have my Peri word.
-Okay.

46:20.625 --> 46:21.625
Look.

46:22.541 --> 46:26.875
Suhal is clever.
She must not figure it out, okay?

46:26.958 --> 46:28.541
You can't give up now.

46:28.625 --> 46:31.541
I won't give your instrument
and phone back, okay?

46:31.625 --> 46:33.458
-But I'll forget the 270 liras.
-Okay.

46:33.541 --> 46:35.708
Okay? What's your passcode?

46:36.333 --> 46:38.583
1991. The year when Stan Getz died.

46:38.666 --> 46:43.291
And when I took my captain's exam.
So I won't forget it.

46:43.375 --> 46:45.666
-Are you on Instagram?
-Kind of.

46:45.750 --> 46:47.083
-Is this you?
-Yes.

46:47.666 --> 46:49.416
Fourteen thousand followers.

46:50.041 --> 46:53.666
And you wanna die.
Shame on you. I only have 14.

46:54.458 --> 46:57.791
Okay. I'll take care of everything.

46:57.875 --> 46:58.875
Let's go.

47:06.291 --> 47:07.458
Hello, Suhal.

47:08.083 --> 47:10.208
Are you okay, Mr. Bahtiyar? Take a seat.

47:10.291 --> 47:12.791
I'm so embarrassed, Suhal. I'm so sorry.

47:12.875 --> 47:15.333
It's sad.
I haven't seen you like this before.

47:15.416 --> 47:17.416
No, he is fine. He is all good.

47:18.166 --> 47:21.666
You guys keep chatting, okay?
I have some work upstairs.

47:21.750 --> 47:24.791
There is a rat upstairs.
Do you have rat poison here?

47:24.875 --> 47:27.125
It's up there. In the back.

47:27.208 --> 47:30.291
You drew these? They are lovely, congrats.

47:30.375 --> 47:31.333
Thank you.

47:31.416 --> 47:35.958
She draws them.
She makes them up in her head.

47:36.041 --> 47:37.583
I just draw away.

47:37.666 --> 47:40.083
I'll make some tea now.

47:40.166 --> 47:43.000
Let's sit down and rest.

47:43.083 --> 47:46.375
I got stabbed today
and still haven't sat down.

47:46.458 --> 47:48.833
Ms. Saniye told me to rest too.

47:48.916 --> 47:50.333
She is an alcoholic.

47:50.416 --> 47:52.916
Is it right to label people?

47:53.000 --> 47:55.583
She doesn't care what others say.
We are alike.

47:55.666 --> 47:59.083
It's okay if she doesn't care.
She's still an alcoholic.

47:59.166 --> 48:02.375
Tell Mr. Bahtiyar about it.
He is the professor.

48:06.708 --> 48:08.958
They are all crazy, I swear.

48:09.041 --> 48:11.625
I'm handling all of them.

48:11.708 --> 48:13.416
What's up with this crowd?

48:13.500 --> 48:16.625
But it's a crowd.
I'm a person. So I'm good.

48:18.666 --> 48:22.250
Everybody has a problem with somebody.
They'd fight each other if I let them.

48:24.458 --> 48:26.291
Let's plan everything.

48:42.250 --> 48:45.125
MICKEY-X - RODENT KILLER

48:50.291 --> 48:52.375
Excuse me.

48:53.958 --> 48:54.791
What are you doing?

48:56.750 --> 48:59.250
-You scared me.
-Water, please.

49:00.041 --> 49:01.041
We…

49:01.791 --> 49:06.750
We are chatting with Mr. Bahtiyar
in the laundry room.

49:06.833 --> 49:07.916
Join us if you want.

49:08.625 --> 49:11.541
He is a lot better now. Calmer.

49:11.625 --> 49:13.500
-Sure, fine.
-We're chatting.

49:17.208 --> 49:18.583
Alright.

49:19.375 --> 49:21.416
Let's drink our tea.

49:21.500 --> 49:24.291
We felt sad. We felt emotional.
We met at a weird time.

49:24.375 --> 49:27.416
It'll enter your blood stream
in 20 minutes. Let's talk a bit.

49:28.625 --> 49:30.333
Yes, alright.

49:31.083 --> 49:32.000
Come, sit down.

49:32.500 --> 49:33.875
So, tell us.

49:35.125 --> 49:39.833
I don't want to trouble you
with my problems.

49:39.916 --> 49:42.541
But you were so cheerful
the other day, Mr. Bahtiyar.

49:42.625 --> 49:44.250
We listened to you play on the terrace.

49:44.333 --> 49:48.708
Dear, I think I lost
a bit of hope in life.

49:48.791 --> 49:51.208
I'm ashamed to say it in front of you…

49:51.291 --> 49:53.875
Why, sir? Do we look even more hopeless?

49:54.958 --> 49:58.166
Good catch, Suhal. He is projecting now.

49:58.250 --> 49:59.208
Let me ask.

50:00.166 --> 50:01.458
Does hope sustain the poor?

50:01.541 --> 50:05.541
Or maybe we can ask,
do the rich also need hope?

50:05.625 --> 50:08.208
So, I'm rich? Weird.

50:08.791 --> 50:11.250
I don't get it, sorry. Say it again.

50:11.333 --> 50:12.750
Just talk to pass the time.

50:13.500 --> 50:15.250
What is hope?

50:15.333 --> 50:18.125
I don't really like those set notions.

50:18.208 --> 50:22.875
For example, they say,
"Hope sustains the poor."

50:23.375 --> 50:26.166
It sounds meaningful and powerful
when you say it like that.

50:26.250 --> 50:28.625
But these are heavy concepts.

50:28.708 --> 50:32.583
It would take hours
to look deeply into them all.

50:33.541 --> 50:35.625
Just sum it up in 20 minutes.

50:35.708 --> 50:39.750
I don't really like talking
as if I'm an expert.

50:39.833 --> 50:44.791
But in life, not every kind of hardship
comes with hope on the side.

50:46.041 --> 50:49.208
Anyhow… I quit fighting anyway.

50:49.291 --> 50:52.958
It appears that I did.
I'm waiting to see what happens.

50:54.375 --> 50:56.958
How about this. Knowledge or intuition?

50:58.000 --> 51:00.458
I'm not really a good example. Your…

51:00.541 --> 51:02.666
Wait, what is happening to my voice?

51:02.750 --> 51:03.750
Sorry.

51:04.333 --> 51:05.750
What did you say? Intuition?

51:05.833 --> 51:06.958
Or knowledge?

51:08.791 --> 51:11.708
Dear Metin,
you put me in a tough position.

51:11.791 --> 51:14.375
Can't we discuss it at a better time?

51:14.458 --> 51:17.916
These are hard questions.
Can't we talk about everyday stuff?

51:18.000 --> 51:19.375
So you're saying

51:19.458 --> 51:23.041
you'd die before you discussed
these matters with people like us.

51:23.125 --> 51:26.166
Please, that's not what I meant.
That's not it at all.

51:27.666 --> 51:30.916
So, every day is not a new hope?

51:31.000 --> 51:33.166
Fine. It is.

51:33.250 --> 51:35.458
Sorry, I get a little angry.

51:35.541 --> 51:38.333
I get it. You think
mine is a charmed existence.

51:38.416 --> 51:42.500
But once we acknowledge our troubles,
we need to come to a meaningful analysis.

51:42.583 --> 51:43.833
I understand you, sir.

51:43.916 --> 51:46.500
Really? I'd like to be understood too.

51:47.166 --> 51:49.625
I think you'd actually like to be loved.

51:49.708 --> 51:50.833
No.

51:50.916 --> 51:53.125
Isn't it better to understand?

51:53.208 --> 51:55.333
No. To be understood.

51:55.416 --> 51:59.833
What does it mean to be understood?
Are you a physics question, dear Ayzek?

52:00.375 --> 52:03.208
Please. People want to be loved.

52:03.291 --> 52:07.291
Mr. Davut, I have a question.
To be loved or to be understood?

52:08.416 --> 52:09.958
To love, I think.

52:10.541 --> 52:12.833
Mr. Davut has
a completely different approach.

52:12.916 --> 52:14.541
Please, take a seat, my friend.

52:15.791 --> 52:17.208
But Mr. Davut is already…

52:17.958 --> 52:18.958
Already what?

52:20.125 --> 52:24.958
To be loved is passive,
so he might be avoiding it.

52:25.041 --> 52:26.500
Sorry, that's not the topic.

52:26.583 --> 52:29.750
-He just said, "To love."
-I'm a bit confused, sorry.

52:29.833 --> 52:34.333
Between being loved and loving,
I choose loving, you know.

52:34.416 --> 52:35.791
Loving madly.

52:35.875 --> 52:38.708
Sure, it has to be madly. Anyway.

52:38.791 --> 52:41.500
-Are you making fun of me?
-No, never.

52:41.583 --> 52:42.416
No.

52:42.500 --> 52:45.041
-It's just my head…
-No, I mean…

52:45.125 --> 52:47.750
I don't have a bad opinion of you.

52:47.833 --> 52:50.500
He just said, "To love."
It's not bad. What?

52:50.583 --> 52:53.750
You know, is it wrong to say, "To love"?

52:53.833 --> 52:55.750
-I don't get it.
-No, sir.

52:55.833 --> 52:57.083
What is it?

52:57.708 --> 53:01.000
Rat poison. You gave him rat poison.

53:01.833 --> 53:03.375
Who do you think I am?

53:03.458 --> 53:05.666
He is dying,
and we're drinking tea with him?

53:08.041 --> 53:09.208
Pretty girl.

53:09.291 --> 53:12.541
Letitgoxine, six milligrams.
It's my prescribed pill.

53:12.625 --> 53:15.250
I gave him one.
He'll be mellow in 20 minutes.

53:15.333 --> 53:19.166
And I took his phone.
We'll call his friends to come get him.

53:19.250 --> 53:22.416
-I can't deal with him all night.
-Okay, good idea.

53:22.500 --> 53:24.708
You just wait.
I'll have him dancing in no time.

53:25.833 --> 53:28.083
It's my prescribed pill.

53:28.166 --> 53:29.416
You're on pills?

53:29.500 --> 53:32.916
I am. I take one in the morning,
one at night.

53:36.208 --> 53:40.333
-What's wrong?
-I had two pills here.

53:40.416 --> 53:42.083
But there is none left.

53:42.666 --> 53:43.666
Wait a minute.

53:45.458 --> 53:48.416
It's prescribed. My prescription
was in the pocket of my pants.

53:49.291 --> 53:52.041
-I washed them.
-What do you mean?

53:52.125 --> 53:53.958
But the pockets were empty.

53:54.041 --> 53:55.666
Wait a minute.

53:55.750 --> 53:58.375
I took the bloody prescription
out of my pocket.

53:58.458 --> 54:01.416
I put it down on the reception desk.

54:01.500 --> 54:03.041
-It's not a big deal, but…
-Well…

54:03.125 --> 54:06.000
I thought I had two pills
when I left the house.

54:06.083 --> 54:08.500
But I guess I left one
on the kitchen counter.

54:08.583 --> 54:12.500
-I thought I had two, but there is none.
-You need it? Didn't you take one today?

54:12.583 --> 54:15.083
I need to take another one,
but I have a prescription.

54:15.166 --> 54:18.791
I'm not that addicted.
You think I'm a pill popper, girl?

54:19.708 --> 54:23.375
No, I just thought I had it with me.

54:23.458 --> 54:25.583
-You seem concerned.
-No.

54:25.666 --> 54:29.416
I just take an extra one with me
when I leave the house.

54:29.500 --> 54:33.000
I checked my coat. It's not there.

54:33.083 --> 54:39.041
But at least Ms. Saniye knows me, so…

54:39.125 --> 54:40.041
Oh, good.

54:40.125 --> 54:43.458
I have a prescription,
but it's covered in blood.

54:43.541 --> 54:47.208
But she is on night duty.
Don't worry about it.

54:47.291 --> 54:48.291
Goji berry?

54:51.125 --> 54:52.375
It's good for everything.

54:55.208 --> 54:57.541
-Someone is calling.
-I can't answer now.

54:58.125 --> 54:59.958
What is this? It's sour.

55:00.041 --> 55:01.375
It's an antioxidant.

55:02.125 --> 55:05.791
Anyway. At least, she is on night duty.

55:05.875 --> 55:09.500
She is on night duty, so don't…
Don't worry. Let's not worry.

55:10.208 --> 55:11.083
Let's…

55:12.541 --> 55:13.833
Once he falls asleep…

55:13.916 --> 55:16.208
We never had a chance to talk.

55:16.291 --> 55:18.000
Let's talk about us.

55:18.666 --> 55:19.500
Huh?

55:20.000 --> 55:23.208
Go downstairs. I'll bring us tea.

55:25.916 --> 55:27.333
Let me take this with me.

55:36.833 --> 55:39.125
It's covered in blood.

55:39.750 --> 55:41.000
It's illegible.

55:41.666 --> 55:43.041
Completely illegible.

55:58.916 --> 56:02.041
I mean, they're all emotions, you know.

56:02.125 --> 56:04.250
As far as I understand, of course.

56:04.333 --> 56:07.166
Look, you can't just say,
"They are all emotions"

56:07.250 --> 56:10.083
and leave it there without delving deeper.

56:10.166 --> 56:13.166
When it comes back to you as a problem…

56:13.250 --> 56:16.375
You'll say, "What is a problem?"
Life itself?

56:16.958 --> 56:18.333
Loving madly.

56:20.791 --> 56:23.458
Loving madly is a real thing, right?

56:23.541 --> 56:28.416
I mean, Davut, my friend,
loving like they do in poems and novels.

56:28.500 --> 56:30.458
By the way, he is a literature professor.

56:30.541 --> 56:32.291
You know, loving to death.

56:33.416 --> 56:37.333
That exists.
Loving like they do in poems and songs.

56:38.458 --> 56:43.333
You know how words become meaningless?
That's where I am at right now.

56:43.833 --> 56:47.166
I get it.
You want something powerful, right?

56:47.250 --> 56:52.291
Like a rock, but not a rock,
because it has an organic aspect.

56:52.375 --> 56:55.291
It should be more like cement.

56:55.375 --> 56:57.916
Okay? Like sand, stone, pebble…

56:58.000 --> 57:00.875
It should be a heavy block. Bam! Boom!

57:00.958 --> 57:04.333
We should say something heavy
and respectable. Oh, wow!

57:04.916 --> 57:06.458
What novel are you talking about?

57:07.750 --> 57:09.750
But there are novelized lives.

57:09.833 --> 57:12.083
Yes, but what do you get from them?

57:12.166 --> 57:15.208
Okay, novels and poems have themes.

57:15.291 --> 57:17.500
I get it. But what do you get from them?

57:17.583 --> 57:20.833
I'm talking about what happens
when you are the subject.

57:21.625 --> 57:23.208
Where are you from, Professor?

57:26.583 --> 57:29.291
-He asked where you are from.
-He did!

57:29.375 --> 57:32.833
I haven't heard that one in years!
He is asking where…

57:33.541 --> 57:37.291
-But he said nothing…
-But how… I'm from Suadiye.

57:39.041 --> 57:40.208
He is from Suadiye.

57:40.291 --> 57:42.166
I mean, please…

57:42.875 --> 57:44.208
It's okay to ask.

57:44.291 --> 57:47.916
Is this what you are saying,
Davut, my friend?

57:48.000 --> 57:53.375
Sometimes, we write our lives
as if we were novelists.

57:53.458 --> 57:55.958
Novelists, my ass. You can't write life.

57:56.041 --> 57:57.666
You can only be subjects.

57:57.750 --> 58:00.333
Excuse my cussing, dear Suhal.

58:00.416 --> 58:01.875
-Look.
-Let's… Come.

58:01.958 --> 58:04.333
Floyd Barclay says the following.

58:04.416 --> 58:10.000
He says, "As I'm dying,
I'm only leaving my dignity behind."

58:12.458 --> 58:13.958
Who am I talking to?

58:14.041 --> 58:15.833
Sorry, alright.

58:16.458 --> 58:19.000
I feel like my chest is expanding, Metin.

58:19.083 --> 58:21.416
-Is it happening?
-Sure…

58:21.500 --> 58:23.333
Loving to death exists, you know.

58:23.416 --> 58:25.916
-It exists, fine. It exists.
-It does.

58:26.000 --> 58:28.000
-Was it Floyd Barclay?
-Yeah.

58:28.083 --> 58:31.000
I'll Google him,
because I like to learn new things.

58:31.083 --> 58:34.541
How about going to bed now, sir?
Let's go to your room.

58:34.625 --> 58:38.291
-I'll read a book to feel better.
-Sure, this was enough.

58:38.375 --> 58:41.500
He said nothing, Davut.
He chose loving too.

58:41.583 --> 58:43.291
-Have a good one.
-Alright.

58:43.375 --> 58:45.750
Good night.
I'll make your bed, Mr. Bahtiyar.

58:45.833 --> 58:47.541
-We'll go, come on.
-Shall we…

58:47.625 --> 58:50.250
Your drawings are lovely.
You are a great talent.

58:50.333 --> 58:51.833
MY LOVE

58:52.541 --> 58:53.541
"My love" is calling.

58:56.250 --> 59:00.041
-My head feels like plastic, Metin.
-Yeah? Mine too.

59:04.916 --> 59:07.041
I didn't die, Metin. What do you think?

59:07.125 --> 59:10.625
You? You will never die, good sir.
Let's go.

59:11.375 --> 59:12.583
You will never die.

59:35.583 --> 59:39.333
I imagine a big, blue ball in my hands.

59:39.833 --> 59:41.583
What do I do with it?

59:41.666 --> 59:44.958
My old Peri friends will know
the answer right away.

59:45.583 --> 59:48.375
Turn it off, damn it. It's horrible.

59:48.458 --> 59:50.333
What is a blue ball, for God's sake?

59:50.416 --> 59:53.250
Please don't watch
that ridiculous stuff, Metin.

59:53.333 --> 59:54.916
Don't do it to yourself.

59:55.000 --> 59:56.291
Jeez…

59:57.250 --> 59:59.750
Look, Davut talks through his hat.

01:00:00.708 --> 01:00:02.458
He spoke for ten minutes.

01:00:02.541 --> 01:00:05.583
He didn't form a single sentence
without "you know."

01:00:05.666 --> 01:00:08.833
He kept saying "you know."
"You know this. You know that."

01:00:08.916 --> 01:00:12.458
I couldn't help but ask,
"What do I know, sir?"

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000
It didn't register.

01:00:14.083 --> 01:00:16.208
What do you want him to say?

01:00:16.291 --> 01:00:18.083
Should he say, "I know"?

01:00:18.166 --> 01:00:21.666
He says, "You know."
He's including others.

01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:24.083
I can't believe how positive you are.

01:00:24.166 --> 01:00:26.750
Sometimes, you stir up even me.

01:00:26.833 --> 01:00:31.083
I wanna grab you by the ears
and pour all my knowledge into your head,

01:00:31.166 --> 01:00:33.166
but I'm tired.

01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:35.000
Metin.

01:00:35.083 --> 01:00:37.125
Davut is a menace.

01:00:37.708 --> 01:00:40.500
Sir, tell me something.

01:00:40.583 --> 01:00:43.000
You think Suhal suits me?

01:00:43.583 --> 01:00:45.000
-Honestly?
-Yeah.

01:00:45.500 --> 01:00:46.666
No.

01:00:48.875 --> 01:00:51.708
-Because she is an artist? Right.
-Anyway…

01:01:03.208 --> 01:01:06.541
Hello, Bahtiyar? Are you there? Hello--

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:16.250
"Ms. Dora,

01:01:18.208 --> 01:01:21.500
we are in the Komodor Hotel."

01:01:23.541 --> 01:01:29.375
"Mr. Bahtiyar is sleeping right now."

01:01:30.458 --> 01:01:31.458
"Metin."

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:33.833
I shouldn't sign my name.

01:01:34.375 --> 01:01:35.375
"Çetin."

01:01:36.916 --> 01:01:38.625
I shouldn't sign any names.

01:01:45.666 --> 01:01:47.291
"Goddamn you"?

01:01:47.958 --> 01:01:49.291
What did I say?

01:01:56.291 --> 01:01:57.416
Did he go to sleep?

01:01:57.916 --> 01:01:59.625
The asshole is making fun of us.

01:01:59.708 --> 01:02:03.458
These men are like kids.
Don't take them seriously.

01:02:03.541 --> 01:02:05.500
You are dripping with sweat.
What happened?

01:02:05.583 --> 01:02:07.375
I'm just working, my friend.

01:02:07.458 --> 01:02:08.583
Good.

01:02:08.666 --> 01:02:11.000
Is the lady downstairs your…?

01:02:11.083 --> 01:02:14.666
I'm sorry, but are you two…?

01:02:15.666 --> 01:02:21.166
Our parents stepped in
and had a talk about marrying us.

01:02:21.250 --> 01:02:23.666
But I didn't want to, and she got hurt.

01:02:24.250 --> 01:02:26.000
Marry her out of compassion.

01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.833
I don't think so.
I mean, considering everything…

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:38.208
Fine. I'll go to bed.
I should be up around 7:00 or 7:30.

01:02:39.083 --> 01:02:40.333
Go on and sleep.

01:02:41.250 --> 01:02:43.458
You know, she works nights so she must…

01:02:45.083 --> 01:02:51.166
If you mean it'll make the family stronger
because I also work nights, I agree.

01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:58.500
Take it. You ate nothing all night.
Get yourself food. Here.

01:03:01.333 --> 01:03:05.666
Davut, my friend, you know what I do
when something is wrong?

01:03:05.750 --> 01:03:06.750
Bang bang.

01:03:07.333 --> 01:03:08.333
Always.

01:03:25.208 --> 01:03:28.041
Good morning. I'm Peri. Who are you?

01:03:28.125 --> 01:03:32.875
We meet again on our journey
to find ourselves. Shall we begin?

01:03:32.958 --> 01:03:36.083
Lately, I'm tired
of hearing the following.

01:03:36.791 --> 01:03:39.041
"How do I make them happy?"

01:03:39.125 --> 01:03:43.166
I don't know. Maybe it's too deep.
But you know what I do?

01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:45.041
I take a deep breath.

01:03:46.708 --> 01:03:48.250
And I say,

01:03:49.083 --> 01:03:51.833
"I'm not pizza."

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:56.958
It sounds weird at first.
But don't try to please everyone.

01:03:57.041 --> 01:03:57.875
Why?

01:03:57.958 --> 01:03:59.041
Why?

01:03:59.125 --> 01:04:01.708
Yes, why shouldn't
I try to please everyone?

01:04:01.791 --> 01:04:02.875
It's a simple question.

01:04:15.166 --> 01:04:16.166
Why?

01:04:16.958 --> 01:04:19.041
Why shouldn't I try to please everyone?

01:04:51.625 --> 01:04:52.458
Suhal.

01:04:54.500 --> 01:04:56.666
A lot happened, and we didn't get to talk.

01:04:59.250 --> 01:05:01.958
I misunderstood some stuff.

01:05:02.041 --> 01:05:03.875
You misunderstood some stuff.

01:05:04.791 --> 01:05:05.791
Metin, my friend…

01:05:07.458 --> 01:05:08.458
"My friend"?

01:05:12.916 --> 01:05:15.750
Okay, call me your friend. Fine.

01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:21.416
If I'm projecting as a friend to you,
call me your friend.

01:05:40.125 --> 01:05:44.791
Metin, my friend, our parents
took it upon themselves to discuss it.

01:05:46.125 --> 01:05:48.375
I actually moved out a year ago.

01:05:52.625 --> 01:05:54.291
They said you were our neighbor.

01:05:55.541 --> 01:05:58.125
And you could work at the hotel
and talk to me.

01:05:58.625 --> 01:06:01.666
And you started working here. That's it.

01:06:04.375 --> 01:06:06.583
They said you had been home for two years,

01:06:06.666 --> 01:06:09.000
you needed it, and your mom cried a lot.

01:06:10.375 --> 01:06:11.750
They gave you a sob story.

01:06:12.875 --> 01:06:15.916
Alright, but it's a really toxic approach.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:20.958
They think so
because it's outside of their mentality.

01:06:21.041 --> 01:06:24.041
I didn't pity you. I'm also…

01:06:25.541 --> 01:06:27.291
We come from the same place.

01:06:27.958 --> 01:06:29.250
Life is difficult.

01:06:30.583 --> 01:06:33.791
Okay, what you are doing now
is called "zoning."

01:06:34.291 --> 01:06:38.125
You're pulling me to your zone.
You're empathizing with me.

01:06:38.208 --> 01:06:39.541
There was a video about it.

01:06:39.625 --> 01:06:41.541
-Okay, fine.
-I mean…

01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:45.250
We can't figure everything out
in one night.

01:06:46.083 --> 01:06:49.916
Marriage? I gave my mom
a piece of my mind about it.

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:51.416
She was just being a mom.

01:06:54.458 --> 01:06:57.833
So we will just say…

01:06:59.333 --> 01:07:01.833
"Our moms brought us into this world."

01:07:01.916 --> 01:07:04.791
And we will just accept how they are.

01:07:05.416 --> 01:07:08.833
It was mentioned in root therapy.
No need to go there. Never mind.

01:07:13.041 --> 01:07:14.041
I mean…

01:07:15.166 --> 01:07:16.666
It hurt that you pitied me.

01:07:18.666 --> 01:07:20.000
Wow. Pity…

01:07:20.708 --> 01:07:22.666
I mean…

01:07:23.958 --> 01:07:25.166
I called my mom.

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:30.208
I said, "Suhal is a beautiful girl."

01:07:30.291 --> 01:07:31.875
Don't get me wrong.

01:07:31.958 --> 01:07:35.166
I said, "She is beautiful.
She deserves beautiful things."

01:07:35.250 --> 01:07:37.208
"We may not be suitable."

01:07:40.541 --> 01:07:42.375
I said…

01:07:43.333 --> 01:07:47.166
I figured if I did something,

01:07:47.250 --> 01:07:52.541
you could maybe form the notion
that I didn't like you.

01:07:53.083 --> 01:07:58.041
So I decided to give off the energy
that I liked you.

01:07:59.125 --> 01:08:00.166
Then…

01:08:00.791 --> 01:08:03.333
Then, I was a little short
with you because…

01:08:04.833 --> 01:08:07.041
I was being intuitive. I mean…

01:08:07.541 --> 01:08:09.416
You gave me some information now.

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:12.375
I'm turning my intuition
into information and saying…

01:08:14.583 --> 01:08:17.708
I mean… You deserve beautiful things.

01:08:19.958 --> 01:08:24.208
In terms of our adapting… I get it.

01:08:24.708 --> 01:08:27.333
As a result… I mean…

01:08:29.541 --> 01:08:32.458
I understand your struggle. Truly.

01:08:32.541 --> 01:08:36.916
After all, you are a young woman
trying to stand on her own two feet.

01:08:38.083 --> 01:08:39.083
Sorry.

01:08:41.708 --> 01:08:42.708
I apologize.

01:08:47.375 --> 01:08:49.791
-It was in the video.
-What freaking video?

01:08:50.458 --> 01:08:51.583
Dumbass!

01:08:52.333 --> 01:08:53.333
Fuck off!

01:08:55.583 --> 01:08:56.583
Well…

01:08:57.625 --> 01:08:58.625
Um…

01:09:01.541 --> 01:09:02.916
You know PeriWords?

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.583
On Instagram… Videos…

01:09:06.291 --> 01:09:07.500
NO SMOKING!

01:10:06.041 --> 01:10:07.541
Wanna watch a video?

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:10.791
Really? Interesting.

01:10:11.625 --> 01:10:14.291
Don't play it too loud.
Don't play it through here.

01:10:14.375 --> 01:10:16.041
But you need to hear it.

01:10:17.041 --> 01:10:20.250
When I come home,
I feel like I'm in my castle.

01:10:20.333 --> 01:10:22.208
A castle of cotton, of course.

01:10:22.833 --> 01:10:24.750
I don't know how I came up with that name.

01:10:25.375 --> 01:10:28.083
Okay, people always ask me
the following question.

01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:30.958
"Who is my soulmate?"

01:10:31.041 --> 01:10:33.750
This girl had her face done.
She got surgeries.

01:10:34.375 --> 01:10:36.500
It's not about that.

01:10:36.583 --> 01:10:40.375
I'm looking for the self-help stuff.
This is what I do these days.

01:10:41.750 --> 01:10:44.625
It's 4:00 a.m. Stop it, for God's sake.

01:10:46.458 --> 01:10:49.208
I keep picking the songs.
You pick one now.

01:10:49.291 --> 01:10:51.708
But keep going with slow songs.

01:10:53.791 --> 01:10:55.291
I typed in "saxophone."

01:10:58.500 --> 01:10:59.500
Saxophone.

01:11:03.833 --> 01:11:05.458
I don't like blowing it.

01:11:07.666 --> 01:11:10.708
I do it only when I'm in love.

01:11:14.791 --> 01:11:18.666
-Come here. Come on.
-Well…

01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:21.583
Come here.

01:11:25.333 --> 01:11:28.291
Well, I need to take my meds.

01:11:29.166 --> 01:11:32.500
Alright, if you take it now,
it will take 20 minutes to work.

01:11:32.583 --> 01:11:35.875
No, I mean… Letitgoxine, six milligrams.

01:11:37.041 --> 01:11:38.791
That's really strong, man.

01:11:38.875 --> 01:11:43.583
Well, can you give me one?

01:11:44.833 --> 01:11:45.916
My love.

01:11:47.208 --> 01:11:49.541
-Do you have a prescription?
-No.

01:11:51.833 --> 01:11:55.458
I don't like it when people are
more cunning than me. Don't make me mad.

01:11:55.541 --> 01:12:00.541
No, I took one in the morning.
I need to take another at night.

01:12:03.166 --> 01:12:07.166
I wouldn't give you an addictive pill
even if you fucked me.

01:12:08.833 --> 01:12:11.416
-So…
-So, no.

01:12:12.208 --> 01:12:14.708
Oh. You won't give it, right.

01:12:17.708 --> 01:12:19.833
Jeez!

01:12:20.541 --> 01:12:23.416
You think you can fuck me over
because I'm drunk?

01:12:24.125 --> 01:12:26.000
Who do you prefer, Ajda or Sezen?

01:12:26.083 --> 01:12:29.083
-In what regard?
-Shut it! Who shall we listen to?

01:12:29.166 --> 01:12:32.500
You were a lovely lady.
I just wanted one pill.

01:12:32.583 --> 01:12:33.791
We're neighbors!

01:12:34.958 --> 01:12:36.833
Now you sound like a shopkeeper.

01:12:36.916 --> 01:12:39.791
Look, I'm not pizza.
I can't please everyone!

01:12:40.375 --> 01:12:41.833
Don't make me mad.

01:12:41.916 --> 01:12:44.458
I just need a pill. Why can't you give it?

01:12:44.541 --> 01:12:46.875
I'm on probation here.
My hands will start to shake.

01:12:46.958 --> 01:12:50.250
What if I break something? Just one pill!

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:51.791
-Okay!
-Why can't you give it?

01:12:51.875 --> 01:12:53.458
Calm down. I will. Get out.

01:12:53.541 --> 01:12:55.416
-You will?
-Get out. I will.

01:12:55.500 --> 01:12:58.125
-Give me just one.
-I will. Just get out.

01:12:58.208 --> 01:13:01.833
-Okay. You will?
-Promise. Get out. Careful.

01:13:01.916 --> 01:13:03.208
-Don't close it.
-Okay.

01:13:03.291 --> 01:13:04.958
-You will?
-Promise.

01:13:05.041 --> 01:13:07.083
-I will. Let's close it.
-Okay.

01:13:08.625 --> 01:13:11.583
Look, I'm even more of a devil
than you are.

01:13:11.666 --> 01:13:15.000
Fuck off! You bastard.
Pill-popping asshole!

01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:16.791
You're the pill popper!

01:13:16.875 --> 01:13:19.333
The doctor gave me the pill, okay?

01:13:19.416 --> 01:13:21.916
I'm trying to get better.
You have all the pills!

01:13:22.791 --> 01:13:23.791
You drunk!

01:13:25.958 --> 01:13:27.250
You drink like a fish!

01:13:27.958 --> 01:13:29.208
It was just one pill…

01:13:30.333 --> 01:13:31.500
You're the pill lady!

01:13:34.250 --> 01:13:37.750
Okay. Ajda or Sezen?
Sezen. Please open up.

01:14:11.875 --> 01:14:13.708
Good evening, Mr. Çetin.

01:14:18.958 --> 01:14:20.208
Yes, ma'am. I'm Çetin.

01:14:20.791 --> 01:14:23.500
Welcome aboard. How may I help you?

01:14:23.583 --> 01:14:27.125
How is it going, I wonder?
Is everything okay?

01:14:27.208 --> 01:14:30.041
Yes. Look, I'm eating almonds.

01:14:33.083 --> 01:14:34.708
-Shall we?
-After you.

01:14:39.208 --> 01:14:41.500
Everyone's complaining about you.

01:14:41.583 --> 01:14:44.916
It's the service industry, ma'am.
It's hard to deal with people.

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:47.000
Come join our industry.

01:14:47.083 --> 01:14:48.708
Don't you also deal with people?

01:14:49.208 --> 01:14:50.208
No.

01:14:57.958 --> 01:14:58.958
After you, ma'am.

01:15:09.291 --> 01:15:11.708
-What do you have for food?
-What would you like?

01:15:13.541 --> 01:15:17.083
A quinoa salad with a slice of avocado.

01:15:18.708 --> 01:15:22.666
And some juice with it, maybe?

01:15:22.750 --> 01:15:25.208
Papaya, please. Reduces inflammation.

01:15:25.291 --> 01:15:26.250
Right away.

01:15:28.625 --> 01:15:30.416
Ms. Peri, I'm glad you are here.

01:15:30.916 --> 01:15:34.250
I need to serve you.
Our other guests are worthless.

01:15:34.333 --> 01:15:35.458
Go on.

01:15:35.541 --> 01:15:36.541
Okay.

01:15:51.125 --> 01:15:54.583
A quinoa salad with avocado slices on top.

01:15:55.083 --> 01:15:56.250
What the hell?

01:15:56.333 --> 01:15:58.083
We're all eating rice, honey.

01:15:58.916 --> 01:16:02.166
Hurry up! The guest is waiting!

01:16:03.291 --> 01:16:04.458
What is he talking about?

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:36.916
Beautiful.

01:16:37.916 --> 01:16:40.333
I eat this stuff too. Look at my skin.

01:16:41.333 --> 01:16:42.458
Skincare is important.

01:16:42.541 --> 01:16:47.208
Ms. Peri, you always say in your videos,
"Imagine it, and it will happen."

01:16:48.250 --> 01:16:52.833
Do you think it's not happening for me
because I'm in my comfort zone?

01:16:52.916 --> 01:16:57.041
What's a comfort zone, for God's sake?
What do I always say in my videos?

01:16:57.125 --> 01:17:00.458
"Don't play it safe.
Be open to adventure."

01:17:00.541 --> 01:17:05.250
Who will collect garbage in the morning
if everyone goes on an adventure?

01:17:05.833 --> 01:17:07.166
What garbage?

01:17:08.375 --> 01:17:10.291
I was just wondering.

01:17:11.416 --> 01:17:12.875
Thanks, you can take it away.

01:17:16.041 --> 01:17:18.666
We promise you
the comfort of your mother's womb.

01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:20.208
-Oh?
-Sure.

01:17:20.291 --> 01:17:25.833
Or the freedom that makes you feel
as if you're flying on the other side.

01:17:26.750 --> 01:17:30.666
But I need the part
between those two points.

01:17:33.250 --> 01:17:34.250
I see.

01:17:35.083 --> 01:17:36.833
But I'm not a small baby.

01:17:37.333 --> 01:17:38.708
And I'm not dead.

01:17:39.208 --> 01:17:40.375
Weird…

01:17:55.375 --> 01:17:56.916
Come on in.

01:17:57.000 --> 01:17:58.541
I came to check on you.

01:17:59.333 --> 01:18:01.583
I'm checking on me too. Take a seat.

01:18:03.208 --> 01:18:05.958
Guess who came to the hotel. Peri Sönmez.

01:18:06.041 --> 01:18:08.958
We're doing a one-on-one session.
You'll all see when we finish.

01:18:09.791 --> 01:18:11.833
Do you know what your dilemma is?

01:18:11.916 --> 01:18:14.708
People who can advise you
don't have the time.

01:18:14.791 --> 01:18:17.541
People who have the time to advise you
don't have the brains.

01:18:17.625 --> 01:18:21.166
-Who are you quoting?
-Myself, dear. Feel free to use it.

01:18:21.708 --> 01:18:24.291
I'll Google
if this is a quote from someone.

01:18:26.083 --> 01:18:29.875
Ms. Peri always says,
"Imagine it, and it will happen."

01:18:30.958 --> 01:18:33.750
You can't have a feast
without working for it.

01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:35.166
What feast?

01:18:35.250 --> 01:18:38.333
She just asked for an avocado salad.
Don't slander her.

01:18:38.916 --> 01:18:42.250
Look, does this make a sound
if you don't blow into it?

01:18:42.333 --> 01:18:43.958
So? What do you mean?

01:18:44.041 --> 01:18:45.916
I mean, do you remember the saying,

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:50.666
"If you're the smartest person
in the room, you are in the wrong room"?

01:18:52.083 --> 01:18:55.000
Cut to the chase. I know what you mean.

01:18:55.083 --> 01:18:58.416
I'm leaving this room immediately.
You clearly don't have time, okay?

01:18:59.416 --> 01:19:03.541
You really thought I'd kill you
for 8,000 to 10,000 dollars?

01:19:03.625 --> 01:19:04.791
You should apologize.

01:19:05.625 --> 01:19:07.000
You're right.

01:19:07.083 --> 01:19:09.666
I told you that Floyd Barclay quote.

01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:13.416
"As I'm dying,
I'm only leaving my dignity behind."

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:16.250
I guess I left my dignity behind
at that moment.

01:19:16.333 --> 01:19:18.125
Sorry. I'm okay now, don't worry.

01:19:18.208 --> 01:19:20.000
You're okay? I'm not!

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:22.166
Do not disturb me again!

01:19:24.083 --> 01:19:25.458
What is he talking about?

01:19:39.833 --> 01:19:43.000
Do not disturb me. You're disturbing me.

01:20:03.333 --> 01:20:07.416
"You…" "Loving you…"

01:20:08.791 --> 01:20:10.958
"You…" "Loving me…"

01:20:11.875 --> 01:20:12.875
"Love…"

01:20:14.500 --> 01:20:15.833
LOVING ME…

01:20:15.916 --> 01:20:17.083
"You…"

01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:41.625
I don't like it when people do a favor
and expect something in return.

01:20:41.708 --> 01:20:44.083
Understood? Okay? Take the pants.

01:20:44.166 --> 01:20:46.250
I don't want you around me!

01:20:46.333 --> 01:20:49.916
My appearance means
nothing to me right now, okay?

01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.250
I don't care what people say!

01:20:53.291 --> 01:20:54.708
Do not disturb me!

01:21:03.125 --> 01:21:06.208
You did the right thing.
People should know their place.

01:21:06.833 --> 01:21:08.500
She still gave me the cold shoulder.

01:21:08.583 --> 01:21:11.958
So what? It's a noble kind of loneliness.

01:21:12.041 --> 01:21:15.041
Right, I don't need anyone.

01:21:20.541 --> 01:21:23.333
Saniye! Open the door! Open it!

01:21:23.875 --> 01:21:26.833
You alcoholic!
You nasty woman! You alcoholic!

01:21:26.916 --> 01:21:28.916
It all started great!

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:31.708
You ruined everything!

01:21:31.791 --> 01:21:32.875
Open up!

01:21:32.958 --> 01:21:35.250
Give me my medicine!

01:21:38.666 --> 01:21:39.791
Give me my medicine!

01:21:40.291 --> 01:21:42.291
I told you to open it!

01:21:42.375 --> 01:21:44.208
Open up!

01:21:44.291 --> 01:21:45.458
Give me medicine!

01:21:46.041 --> 01:21:47.000
Open up!

01:21:47.083 --> 01:21:49.625
You ruined everything!

01:21:49.708 --> 01:21:51.958
Open it!

01:21:52.750 --> 01:21:56.666
I'm begging you! Please open it!

01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:58.750
I'm begging you, please.

01:22:00.250 --> 01:22:01.916
Please open up.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.125
Just one.

01:22:04.083 --> 01:22:05.125
Only one.

01:22:07.166 --> 01:22:10.875
Fine. I'll open it.
I'll give you your medicine.

01:22:12.500 --> 01:22:13.708
On one condition, though.

01:22:14.250 --> 01:22:16.750
I'll do whatever you want.

01:22:16.833 --> 01:22:17.833
Promise.

01:22:20.250 --> 01:22:21.250
What's going on?

01:22:22.333 --> 01:22:23.958
Nothing.

01:22:34.625 --> 01:22:35.625
What's up?

01:22:35.708 --> 01:22:38.375
I was a sailor, sir.
We'll land safe and sound.

01:22:39.125 --> 01:22:40.125
I got this.

01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:57.750
Asshole.

01:23:40.875 --> 01:23:43.958
Could you pass me the saxophone, sir?
Could you?

01:23:46.375 --> 01:23:49.708
I've been very kind and loving
to both of you.

01:23:49.791 --> 01:23:52.916
But I can't see any progress
in our relationships, okay?

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:54.875
Only Mr. Davut is as good as ever.

01:23:55.375 --> 01:23:57.916
Go on, play music and dance
like I'm not here.

01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:01.541
-What's wrong? You're drenched in sweat.
-Really, Professor?

01:24:01.625 --> 01:24:05.041
"Everyone is a therapist.
Everyone has an opinion."

01:24:05.125 --> 01:24:06.375
I wonder who said that.

01:24:16.791 --> 01:24:17.875
What's this?

01:24:19.625 --> 01:24:22.000
Young people like it. Can you play it?

01:24:22.083 --> 01:24:23.083
Please…

01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:25.916
Can you?

01:24:26.916 --> 01:24:27.791
Go on.

01:24:38.666 --> 01:24:41.125
Okay. This will be a story
and also on your feed.

01:24:41.208 --> 01:24:44.875
Look, I can adapt. Can you two?

01:24:44.958 --> 01:24:47.541
-You're scoffing, right?
-Please. We had a laugh.

01:24:48.416 --> 01:24:51.916
You're all happy
thanks to my kindness, get it?

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:54.916
I'm carrying your burden.
I'm doing everyone's work.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.416
Including Saniye!
What do I get in return? Nothing.

01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:58.833
Didn't you take your pill?

01:24:59.791 --> 01:25:03.416
"Did you take your pill?"
I think you took your pill!

01:25:03.958 --> 01:25:05.875
Did you know this lady slapped me?

01:25:05.958 --> 01:25:09.208
Did you ever slap this gentleman?
Who am I even talking to?

01:25:10.125 --> 01:25:14.458
"Imagine, my love.
Imagine a jailer, jealous of the jailed."

01:25:14.958 --> 01:25:16.666
"It is all so very tragic."

01:25:16.750 --> 01:25:19.833
"They are jealous of us.
And they will be jealous."

01:25:19.916 --> 01:25:24.291
"Because it's hard to live history
as a proper human being."

01:25:24.375 --> 01:25:25.625
Edip Cansever.

01:25:27.250 --> 01:25:30.250
I'll find the best quote ever
on the internet!

01:25:30.333 --> 01:25:32.375
Okay? I'll find the best one.

01:25:33.666 --> 01:25:34.666
Look.

01:25:35.833 --> 01:25:39.166
"Life lasts a day,
and that day is today." Can Yücel.

01:25:39.250 --> 01:25:41.041
-He never said that.
-Really?

01:25:41.916 --> 01:25:44.583
You're a professor,
but you're ignorant about the internet.

01:25:44.666 --> 01:25:47.458
The internet is full of these.
He has no idea!

01:25:47.541 --> 01:25:49.791
I'll defeat you, my man. I swear.

01:25:49.875 --> 01:25:52.000
Don't play with me. I'll defeat you.

01:25:53.375 --> 01:25:55.625
You are dead to me, okay?

01:25:55.708 --> 01:25:59.250
I'm just trying to teach Suhal
more about life.

01:25:59.333 --> 01:26:00.625
You don't care about that.

01:26:00.708 --> 01:26:04.666
You even said, "I'm not a good example."
Shut up then.

01:26:04.750 --> 01:26:08.458
Suhal, you have dreams, right?
Are these your dreams?

01:26:08.541 --> 01:26:12.333
Let me see.
You haven't progressed at all. Is that it?

01:26:12.416 --> 01:26:15.791
Like, is this a woman? What is it? What?

01:26:15.875 --> 01:26:19.375
They look amateurish.
Is this how you get into university?

01:26:19.458 --> 01:26:22.958
If this is the state of our schools,
it's worrying. Which is true.

01:26:23.041 --> 01:26:25.458
What's wrong with her drawing?
It's naïve and consistent.

01:26:25.541 --> 01:26:27.166
Oh, yeah!

01:26:27.250 --> 01:26:32.083
Look, Van Gogh's brother told him
that his paintings looked quickly drawn.

01:26:32.166 --> 01:26:33.000
And?

01:26:33.083 --> 01:26:36.000
And he said,
"Because you take a quick look at them."

01:26:36.083 --> 01:26:37.875
Holy crap!

01:26:37.958 --> 01:26:40.875
Look at Van Gogh!
He was quick on his feet.

01:26:40.958 --> 01:26:42.791
He had a quip for his older brother.

01:26:42.875 --> 01:26:46.083
Don't you have a statement of your own?

01:26:46.166 --> 01:26:50.250
"Van Gogh said this. Doystoy said that."
It's just gossip, huh?

01:26:50.333 --> 01:26:54.125
"Have you read this book? And this poem?"
You keep dropping names.

01:26:54.208 --> 01:26:57.708
-"The books I read can fill this room."
-I never said that.

01:26:57.791 --> 01:27:00.333
Yeah? And I grew up in a book-sized room.

01:27:00.416 --> 01:27:03.000
-You're just seeking manifestos.
-Yeah?

01:27:03.083 --> 01:27:05.916
I gave you information.
You rejected that too.

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.833
Who am I even talking to?

01:27:07.916 --> 01:27:10.458
You know who you are? It's right here.

01:27:10.541 --> 01:27:14.000
"You are a vile man."
Not my words, by the way.

01:27:14.083 --> 01:27:15.208
Ayzek, enough.

01:27:15.291 --> 01:27:18.541
Ayzek? See, it says Çetin.
Read it if you are literate.

01:27:20.750 --> 01:27:23.916
You show off to her,
but when it comes to me…

01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:27.708
If you wanted to be understood,
you'd try to explain.

01:27:27.791 --> 01:27:32.416
-Don't argue with stupid people…
-Yes, that's an internet quote too!

01:27:32.500 --> 01:27:36.916
"Don't argue with stupid people.
They will drag you down to their level…"

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.375
Why don't you take me to your level?

01:27:39.458 --> 01:27:42.750
Pull me up to your level!

01:27:42.833 --> 01:27:45.208
And I'll be on your level, no?

01:27:45.291 --> 01:27:46.875
Metin, that's enough.

01:27:48.083 --> 01:27:50.958
-Bitch ass!
-Watch it!

01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:53.833
Okay, I'm sorry.

01:27:54.666 --> 01:27:57.541
But I'll stop talking
to both of you, okay?

01:27:57.625 --> 01:27:59.166
And I'll unfollow you.

01:27:59.250 --> 01:28:01.333
Go find out what it means.

01:28:04.250 --> 01:28:07.583
Do you know
what hurts me the most in life?

01:28:07.666 --> 01:28:10.458
Being enemies
with learned people like you.

01:28:11.875 --> 01:28:13.666
Let me join you up there.

01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:16.375
Let me, please. Let me be with you.

01:28:18.291 --> 01:28:21.833
Please stop watching those videos.
Please stop it.

01:28:22.708 --> 01:28:24.958
You're jealous!

01:28:25.041 --> 01:28:26.416
-Please…
-You are!

01:28:28.208 --> 01:28:29.250
You drew him?

01:28:30.458 --> 01:28:34.041
You said you drew from memory!
But he posed for you!

01:28:45.208 --> 01:28:46.916
You just wait…

01:28:52.208 --> 01:28:55.208
"I…" "I was born with you."

01:28:56.666 --> 01:28:57.666
"You…"

01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:02.333
"You died with me."

01:29:02.416 --> 01:29:05.500
Here is a can of worms for you…

01:29:05.583 --> 01:29:06.500
"You…"

01:29:07.416 --> 01:29:10.666
"I gave you my hands, my precious rose."

01:29:11.291 --> 01:29:13.375
"My precious rose…"

01:29:13.458 --> 01:29:14.458
"But…"

01:29:15.625 --> 01:29:19.666
"But you had my heart in your hands."

01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:21.166
A can of worms for you.

01:29:21.958 --> 01:29:23.166
Here it is.

01:29:26.083 --> 01:29:28.208
NEW POST

01:29:28.291 --> 01:29:29.291
Alright.

01:29:31.333 --> 01:29:33.750
He got a like even for that!

01:31:17.875 --> 01:31:18.916
Here.

01:31:24.875 --> 01:31:26.833
Don't say a word about it, okay?

01:31:26.916 --> 01:31:28.083
Yes, ma'am.

01:31:43.041 --> 01:31:45.250
A good deed, huh? Look at yourself.

01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:47.000
I didn't say it, I swear.

01:31:49.041 --> 01:31:51.208
You turned out to be such an awful person.

01:31:52.000 --> 01:31:53.041
You think so?

01:31:57.083 --> 01:31:59.125
Take this. Keep it for yourself.

01:32:00.208 --> 01:32:01.625
No, there is no need.

01:32:07.541 --> 01:32:09.750
You have a victim mentality.

01:32:09.833 --> 01:32:12.791
You make stupid jokes
about serious matters.

01:32:12.875 --> 01:32:13.875
True.

01:32:14.458 --> 01:32:17.666
I found you funny only once. Just once.

01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:19.333
That's okay, thanks.

01:32:19.958 --> 01:32:22.541
-You're right, brother.
-Thanks.

01:32:23.208 --> 01:32:24.791
What show are you on?

01:32:24.875 --> 01:32:26.166
Um, The Love Boat.

01:32:31.250 --> 01:32:32.416
PLEASE SERVICE MY ROOM

01:32:32.500 --> 01:32:34.541
Are you angry, my love? Here.

01:32:43.333 --> 01:32:45.666
Dude, you wronged me, you know?

01:32:46.166 --> 01:32:48.041
You're right. Forgive me.

01:32:58.208 --> 01:33:00.625
-You want to be loved.
-True.

01:33:01.666 --> 01:33:04.083
-I love you, my brother.
-Yes.

01:33:12.875 --> 01:33:14.166
Ajda or Sezen?

01:33:15.041 --> 01:33:16.083
Both.

01:33:29.125 --> 01:33:30.708
I understand you all.

01:33:30.791 --> 01:33:32.625
Remember Floyd Barclay.

01:33:33.208 --> 01:33:34.208
Okay.

01:33:39.125 --> 01:33:40.125
Enjoy.

01:33:41.166 --> 01:33:43.625
Your videos are useless.
We'll have a talk.

01:33:46.708 --> 01:33:48.083
Did you take your pill?

01:33:48.166 --> 01:33:49.875
No, we'll talk with a clear head.

01:33:50.375 --> 01:33:52.041
I'm putting myself out there.

01:33:52.125 --> 01:33:54.583
But they are arguing with me
instead of respecting me.

01:33:54.666 --> 01:33:56.250
-Who?
-Everyone!

01:33:56.333 --> 01:33:59.500
Don't worry about it.
These are toxic thoughts.

01:33:59.583 --> 01:34:01.250
In your videos, do you ever say,

01:34:01.333 --> 01:34:04.583
"Take a look at yourself,
analyze yourself"?

01:34:04.666 --> 01:34:07.541
No. You say, "Put yourself in the center."

01:34:07.625 --> 01:34:10.166
Who am I to be in the center? Wait.

01:34:10.250 --> 01:34:12.833
What? Who am I? Maybe I'm an asshole.

01:34:12.916 --> 01:34:15.708
Then you tell me to take a deep breath.
That's it.

01:34:15.791 --> 01:34:17.416
Paranoia.

01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:20.208
What did you eat?
Did you eat acidic foods today?

01:34:20.291 --> 01:34:22.541
Clearly. What else could it be?

01:34:23.041 --> 01:34:26.375
For three months,
my mom didn't know I ate avocado.

01:34:26.458 --> 01:34:29.500
I ate alkaline foods for what?
Everyone's still making fun of me.

01:34:29.583 --> 01:34:32.083
But you're closing off your perception.

01:34:32.166 --> 01:34:34.291
I'm not! I'm sharp as a razor.

01:34:34.375 --> 01:34:36.583
I have eyes everywhere.
Which is unnecessary.

01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:41.958
Do you grate cinnamon sticks
onto your probiotic yogurt?

01:34:42.041 --> 01:34:43.791
I don't grate shit.

01:34:43.875 --> 01:34:48.083
Our families used to eat a kilo
of cheese pie on Sundays 30 years ago.

01:34:48.166 --> 01:34:49.708
And we weren't stressed.

01:34:50.416 --> 01:34:53.166
You don't teach me
how to communicate with others.

01:34:53.250 --> 01:34:56.583
But I see it now.
I'll wreck you on Twitter.

01:35:00.125 --> 01:35:02.250
You have 14 followers, Ayzek.

01:35:02.333 --> 01:35:04.666
So? Aren't they human beings?

01:35:04.750 --> 01:35:08.083
Sure, it means nothing
if I don't have a million followers.

01:35:09.541 --> 01:35:12.041
Keep attacking us because we are helpless.

01:35:12.125 --> 01:35:13.750
I'm piss-poor.

01:35:13.833 --> 01:35:16.916
But I'm not good
because I don't eat probiotic yogurt?

01:35:17.541 --> 01:35:20.916
You have an opinion on everything.
"Carob pods make you feel peaceful."

01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:22.583
You even have an opinion on bulgur.

01:35:22.666 --> 01:35:24.708
Stop freaking knowing everything

01:35:24.791 --> 01:35:28.125
from the rings of Saturn
to the stuff in a mother's womb!

01:35:28.208 --> 01:35:30.666
People should doubt themselves a little.

01:35:31.500 --> 01:35:34.458
Honey, is your immunity important or not?

01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:38.458
How could eating sausage be a crime? Huh?

01:35:38.541 --> 01:35:40.875
I'm on bad terms with my mom. Okay, fine.

01:35:40.958 --> 01:35:43.750
My mom is bad. I'm bad. It happens.

01:35:43.833 --> 01:35:46.333
But why do I listen to you?

01:35:46.416 --> 01:35:48.333
I stopped talking
to my brother-in-law Ibrahim

01:35:48.416 --> 01:35:49.875
because Mercury is in retrograde.

01:35:49.958 --> 01:35:51.291
Because it's toxic. What?

01:35:52.375 --> 01:35:53.791
But I know now.

01:35:53.875 --> 01:35:56.500
I'll be after you till Judgment Day.

01:35:57.666 --> 01:35:59.916
The afterlife. My favorite.

01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:03.416
Sure. You're all there too, right?
Angel energy or whatever.

01:36:03.500 --> 01:36:06.625
Don't meddle with everything.
Miss out on some stuff.

01:36:07.208 --> 01:36:09.333
I moved to Peru, you know?

01:36:09.416 --> 01:36:12.166
There is a temple there at 5,000 meters.

01:36:12.250 --> 01:36:16.416
There, you do breathing
and energy and yoga…

01:36:16.500 --> 01:36:19.750
-Am I talking to myself?
-Of course.

01:36:19.833 --> 01:36:21.791
Huh? Am I talking to myself?

01:36:21.875 --> 01:36:22.916
Yes.

01:36:24.125 --> 01:36:25.750
You hurt me with your videos.

01:36:25.833 --> 01:36:28.250
But I'm hurt too, Metin.

01:36:28.333 --> 01:36:29.583
Yes, Mom?

01:36:29.666 --> 01:36:32.041
Metin, son, I don't like
the way you've been acting.

01:36:32.125 --> 01:36:33.208
It's okay, Mom.

01:36:33.291 --> 01:36:36.375
I accept and approve of myself. It's okay.

01:36:36.458 --> 01:36:39.291
Don't talk to your mom.
She is completely negative.

01:36:39.375 --> 01:36:40.583
She is, right?

01:36:42.125 --> 01:36:43.125
I have a question.

01:36:44.666 --> 01:36:46.375
Are you all happy at least?

01:36:47.791 --> 01:36:49.458
Am I the only failure?

01:36:50.875 --> 01:36:53.875
How would I know, dear Metin?
I died two years ago.

01:36:54.458 --> 01:36:56.000
Those are old videos.

01:36:56.083 --> 01:36:59.458
I'm happy, of course. I'm pure energy now.

01:37:00.916 --> 01:37:04.875
And those videos, I don't know,
felt good back then, love.

01:37:04.958 --> 01:37:06.750
It's just loneliness, really.

01:37:07.583 --> 01:37:10.208
Really? Is that it? Really?

01:37:12.041 --> 01:37:13.041
How did you die?

01:37:14.166 --> 01:37:16.333
I fell and apparently died while skiing.

01:37:16.416 --> 01:37:17.583
In Uludağ?

01:37:17.666 --> 01:37:19.041
No, somewhere abroad.

01:37:19.125 --> 01:37:20.250
Of course.

01:37:21.291 --> 01:37:23.083
-How did you fall?
-Like this.

01:38:32.541 --> 01:38:33.541
Ayzek!

01:38:34.750 --> 01:38:37.708
What's up? I called you yesterday,
but you didn't answer.

01:38:38.291 --> 01:38:39.666
Wow, Salih, my friend!

01:38:41.500 --> 01:38:45.125
-How are you?
-What happened? You don't look good.

01:38:46.333 --> 01:38:48.166
This is beneath me, right?

01:38:49.750 --> 01:38:52.458
I did great at sea. I fucked up on land.

01:38:53.041 --> 01:38:54.541
Unfortunately.

01:38:54.625 --> 01:38:56.041
The pandemic took its toll too.

01:38:57.083 --> 01:38:58.416
You're not wearing a mask.

01:38:58.500 --> 01:38:59.500
Well…

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:02.708
I stopped wearing them today.

01:39:04.000 --> 01:39:05.791
Are you in touch
with the guys from the port?

01:39:05.875 --> 01:39:08.708
I see Bahri. Mehmet works with me.

01:39:08.791 --> 01:39:09.791
Right.

01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:15.083
If they ask,
tell them Ayzek is a shipwreck now.

01:39:17.875 --> 01:39:19.250
I'm the night manager here.

01:39:51.666 --> 01:39:53.708
-Are you okay?
-I am.

01:39:53.791 --> 01:39:54.791
Suhal…

01:39:55.958 --> 01:39:57.958
You know the…?

01:40:00.291 --> 01:40:02.166
Could you call…

01:40:03.041 --> 01:40:06.291
Mr. Bahtiyar's wife, Dora?

01:40:06.375 --> 01:40:10.541
I sent her a bunch of weird texts.

01:40:10.625 --> 01:40:13.375
I don't want to mess things up.
Could you talk to her?

01:40:17.916 --> 01:40:18.958
What are these?

01:40:20.500 --> 01:40:21.583
What are these?

01:40:21.666 --> 01:40:25.583
I wrote her poems to convince her.

01:40:25.666 --> 01:40:28.125
I also sent quotes from Google.

01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:30.416
What about the poop emoji?

01:40:31.250 --> 01:40:33.166
It seems I got angry at some point.

01:40:33.250 --> 01:40:36.625
Could you call her
so that she comes and gets Mr. Bahtiyar?

01:40:36.708 --> 01:40:38.000
But why?

01:40:40.875 --> 01:40:44.541
I just wanted to be useful
and do something nice.

01:40:46.166 --> 01:40:47.583
I can't call her. You do it.

01:40:50.875 --> 01:40:52.833
Okay, I'll keep you out of it.

01:40:52.916 --> 01:40:54.750
But be yourself, okay?

01:40:56.541 --> 01:40:58.583
I should be myself now.

01:41:00.166 --> 01:41:01.166
Okay.

01:41:14.666 --> 01:41:16.416
-Yes, Bah…
-Hello, ma'am.

01:41:16.500 --> 01:41:20.541
I'm Metin Arıcı, the night manager here
at the Komodor Hotel. Are you Ms. Dora?

01:41:20.625 --> 01:41:23.541
Wait a minute. Where is Bahtiyar?
Did something happen?

01:41:23.625 --> 01:41:27.958
Mr. Bahtiyar had
a little accident last night, ma'am.

01:41:28.041 --> 01:41:30.041
We tried, but couldn't reach you.

01:41:30.125 --> 01:41:31.416
Sorry, what accident?

01:41:32.208 --> 01:41:34.583
Can I see Bahtiyar if he is there?

01:41:34.666 --> 01:41:36.333
Sure. Say you're fine.

01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.208
-I'm fine. Don't worry.
-Did something happen?

01:41:39.791 --> 01:41:42.625
No, ma'am. I'm here. Nothing can happen.

01:41:42.708 --> 01:41:44.291
Thank you so much, Mr. Metin.

01:41:44.833 --> 01:41:46.291
I'll be there soon, Bahtiyar.

01:41:46.375 --> 01:41:48.416
Could you send me your location?

01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:51.625
-Of course, right away.
-Thank you. Thanks.

01:41:51.708 --> 01:41:53.750
Thank you. Thanks, ma'am.

01:41:58.791 --> 01:42:00.250
One thank you was enough.

01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:03.000
I spoke really well.

01:42:03.083 --> 01:42:06.708
I can express myself really well
once I organize my thoughts.

01:42:06.791 --> 01:42:09.208
-Take your phone.
-Thanks.

01:42:09.291 --> 01:42:11.416
You are good at what you do, yes.

01:42:12.333 --> 01:42:17.541
You ignorantly made me take
a random pill, but it's okay.

01:42:20.125 --> 01:42:22.833
-Stop trying too hard.
-I'm not.

01:42:25.416 --> 01:42:26.875
Weird, isn't it, Professor?

01:42:27.458 --> 01:42:31.166
It works if you don't try too hard.
It doesn't work even if I do.

01:42:42.041 --> 01:42:44.666
-Here, sir.
-Thanks.

01:42:45.458 --> 01:42:48.375
You can check it. It hasn't been touched.

01:42:48.458 --> 01:42:49.791
I have no doubts.

01:42:49.875 --> 01:42:54.208
Really? It's good to doubt a little.
You're a scientist after all.

01:42:54.291 --> 01:42:56.958
I'm a man of literature, you know.
I want to believe.

01:42:57.541 --> 01:42:58.625
Floyd Barclay.

01:42:59.125 --> 01:43:01.333
He is very grumpy.
He complains about everything.

01:43:01.416 --> 01:43:03.166
May God make your life easy.

01:43:04.750 --> 01:43:06.375
That's not how we see it.

01:43:07.583 --> 01:43:09.875
You sent me those weird texts, right?

01:43:10.458 --> 01:43:12.875
No, I'm the night manager here.

01:43:14.666 --> 01:43:15.583
Okay.

01:43:16.125 --> 01:43:18.083
Thanks again. Have a good one.

01:43:47.375 --> 01:43:49.375
People are weird, right, Suhal?

01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.583
He left without paying my 270 liras.

01:43:53.500 --> 01:43:55.916
No, everyone is whoever they are.

01:43:58.166 --> 01:43:59.166
Huh!

01:44:01.416 --> 01:44:02.500
Is the nerd gone?

01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:05.208
He wasn't a bad guy.

01:44:05.791 --> 01:44:07.708
-Would you like breakfast?
-No.

01:44:07.791 --> 01:44:08.791
Tea?

01:44:09.625 --> 01:44:11.375
-I'll make some.
-Alright.

01:44:15.416 --> 01:44:19.583
Suhal, Mr. Cengiz said
Hacer would come at 7:00.

01:44:19.666 --> 01:44:21.833
You know her? A woman is coming.

01:44:21.916 --> 01:44:23.000
Yes, it's Mrs. Hacer.

01:44:23.083 --> 01:44:24.166
Morning.

01:44:24.250 --> 01:44:25.458
-How are you?
-Thanks.

01:44:25.541 --> 01:44:26.666
He said she was short.

01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:27.750
Mrs. Hacer!

01:44:30.083 --> 01:44:32.083
-Davut, my man, what is going on?
-Stop!

01:44:32.166 --> 01:44:33.375
What is going on?

01:44:34.291 --> 01:44:35.416
Stop!

01:44:35.916 --> 01:44:37.375
-Hacer!
-Davut?

01:44:39.666 --> 01:44:41.041
-Mrs. Hacer!
-What are you doing?

01:44:41.125 --> 01:44:42.625
-She fell.
-Stop!

01:44:42.708 --> 01:44:43.833
-Davut, man!
-Did it hit?

01:44:43.916 --> 01:44:45.666
Davut, please!

01:44:45.750 --> 01:44:48.541
-My car keys!
-Mrs. Hacer!

01:44:48.625 --> 01:44:51.166
Get me out of here!

01:44:51.250 --> 01:44:53.500
-Is there a back door?
-Give me the gun!

01:44:54.208 --> 01:44:55.500
Are you okay, dear?

01:44:55.583 --> 01:44:56.875
-My friend…
-The exit…

01:44:56.958 --> 01:44:59.750
-How did that happen? What did you do?
-I shot her.

01:44:59.833 --> 01:45:03.500
-Is the exit downstairs? Get me out!
-Don't! I can't!

01:45:03.583 --> 01:45:05.250
Don't! I can't!

01:45:05.875 --> 01:45:07.833
Davut, don't!

01:45:07.916 --> 01:45:11.250
I thought you were a great man,
a good human being.

01:45:11.333 --> 01:45:13.708
-This is why I came here.
-Please.

01:45:13.791 --> 01:45:16.166
I didn't sleep all night!
I made up my mind!

01:45:16.250 --> 01:45:20.208
I was always on your side.
I thought you were good. Please.

01:45:20.833 --> 01:45:24.458
-Here, put it in your pocket.
-This was your idea?

01:45:24.541 --> 01:45:26.416
-I'm thinking.
-You'll run away?

01:45:26.500 --> 01:45:27.750
-I will.
-Don't do it.

01:45:27.833 --> 01:45:30.083
-I will.
-Friend…

01:45:30.708 --> 01:45:34.416
Lose the gun. Throw it away.
You're my friend, okay?

01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:35.791
-Okay.
-You're my friend.

01:45:35.875 --> 01:45:37.583
-Is there an exit there?
-Yes.

01:45:47.833 --> 01:45:50.208
-There is no exit here.
-There is.

01:45:51.583 --> 01:45:54.333
-What is going on?
-I can't go back to the door.

01:45:54.916 --> 01:45:58.791
Look, I was always on your side tonight.

01:45:58.875 --> 01:46:02.541
I thought you were a good man.
Hacer was going to come at 7:00.

01:46:02.625 --> 01:46:05.708
They trusted me with the hotel.
But you shot Hacer!

01:46:05.791 --> 01:46:08.666
I loved her to death! I was dying of love!

01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:12.208
Is this love?
I saw that lovely, beautiful girl here.

01:46:12.291 --> 01:46:15.125
I did things for her.
Mine is not love, but yours is?

01:46:15.208 --> 01:46:16.500
Loving madly!

01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:20.250
Loving like they do in novels and movies!

01:46:20.333 --> 01:46:23.041
What novels, man? What novels?

01:46:23.125 --> 01:46:24.500
What are you talking about?

01:46:24.583 --> 01:46:27.125
Tell me a single novel that you read!

01:46:27.208 --> 01:46:28.125
You know, I…

01:46:28.208 --> 01:46:30.583
Stop saying "you know!"
You're still saying "you!"

01:46:30.666 --> 01:46:32.583
Don't involve others. You need to say "I!"

01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.416
I was on your side.

01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:38.833
I kept saying all night,
"Davut is a good man."

01:46:40.166 --> 01:46:41.583
And you kept doing this!

01:46:42.708 --> 01:46:46.458
I kept putting it in the box,
did you know?

01:46:50.791 --> 01:46:52.500
What's the jail time for this?

01:46:53.416 --> 01:46:55.666
I won't go to jail. I'll run away.

01:46:56.666 --> 01:46:57.666
You'll run away.

01:46:58.958 --> 01:47:00.916
Do you have a nice tie?
