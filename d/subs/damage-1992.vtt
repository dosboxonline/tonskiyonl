00:42.918 --> 00:43.918
I'm sorry, Sir.

00:43.919 --> 00:45.512
I don't mean to hurry you.

00:46.255 --> 00:47.325
The prime minister did ask...

00:47.356 --> 00:48.699
to see you at once.

00:49.925 --> 00:51.427
He doesn't have long, sir.

00:52.361 --> 00:54.705
It's all right. I'm on my way.

00:54.730 --> 00:56.403
- Stephen.
- See you later.

01:03.572 --> 01:05.346
Dr. Fleming, Prime Minister.

01:05.373 --> 01:06.580
Ah, Stephen.

01:08.410 --> 01:11.254
- Welcome.
- Good afternoon, sir.

01:11.280 --> 01:12.725
I owe you a debt of gratitude...

01:12.748 --> 01:14.352
from what I'm told.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.153
Thank you.

01:17.186 --> 01:18.790
You saw off
this backbench rebellion...

01:18.821 --> 01:20.232
over the finance bill.

01:20.255 --> 01:22.394
Rebels went in breathing fire.

01:22.424 --> 01:23.903
Then they came out...

01:23.926 --> 01:25.564
purring like lambs.

01:25.594 --> 01:27.130
That's not quite true.

01:28.397 --> 01:29.535
How did you do it?

01:52.588 --> 01:53.794
Same time tomorrow, Raymond.

01:53.822 --> 01:54.800
Very well, sir.

01:54.823 --> 01:55.893
Good night.

01:58.961 --> 02:01.339
I'm sure she's very nice.
They all are.

02:01.363 --> 02:04.469
Very funny. You'll like her.

02:04.500 --> 02:05.570
Are you in for dinner?

02:06.735 --> 02:08.578
Your father's here.
I have to go.

02:10.205 --> 02:12.082
- Good evening, Beth.
- Good evening, sir.

02:12.107 --> 02:14.713
- Seen Sally?
- She's upstairs.

02:14.743 --> 02:16.723
I'm cooking, believe it or not.

02:16.745 --> 02:18.554
I've got the evening off.

02:18.580 --> 02:20.821
- Enjoy it.
- I will.

02:20.849 --> 02:23.227
Bye, Martyn. Speak to you soon.

02:23.252 --> 02:24.492
Any news?

02:26.522 --> 02:27.967
He's got a new girlfriend.

02:27.990 --> 02:30.800
Really?

02:30.826 --> 02:32.635
What does that mean?

02:32.661 --> 02:34.402
Why can't women see through him?

02:34.430 --> 02:36.603
He just wants to get his leg
over them.

02:37.933 --> 02:39.105
What?

02:43.238 --> 02:45.650
By the way, Edward phoned.

02:47.910 --> 02:49.719
I don't believe your father.

02:51.113 --> 02:54.356
He said the prime minister had
summoned you into his office.

02:58.487 --> 03:00.694
So?

03:00.722 --> 03:02.724
So...he just wanted to chat.

03:05.027 --> 03:08.565
He asked me whether power
meant anything to me.

03:08.597 --> 03:10.599
What did you say?

03:10.632 --> 03:12.475
The usual.

03:12.501 --> 03:14.640
I said my family
was far more important.

03:25.514 --> 03:27.255
Can you come and help me?

03:59.281 --> 04:02.353
God, this is rough.
Does anyone speak English?

04:02.384 --> 04:03.692
One or two.

04:04.419 --> 04:06.592
Why are the French
always so good at these things?

04:08.957 --> 04:11.130
We should be making tracks.

04:11.159 --> 04:13.105
One for the road.

04:13.128 --> 04:14.937
You know my situation.

04:14.963 --> 04:17.273
These days, I don't hurry home.

04:17.298 --> 04:18.572
One more...

04:19.735 --> 04:22.944
and then I really must go,
Donald.

04:22.971 --> 04:24.143
Whiskey?

04:52.568 --> 04:54.445
You're Martyn's father.

04:55.504 --> 04:56.710
I'm Anna Barton.

04:56.738 --> 04:59.947
I felt I ought
to introduce myself.

04:59.975 --> 05:01.147
How do you do?

05:03.645 --> 05:05.386
How long have you known him?

05:05.414 --> 05:07.360
Not very long.

05:08.383 --> 05:10.488
I see.

05:10.519 --> 05:11.725
I've...

05:13.088 --> 05:15.864
We've been close
just a few months.

05:21.163 --> 05:22.335
I've heard about you.

05:33.575 --> 05:34.883
I bumped into Tubby Haycroft.

05:34.910 --> 05:37.356
He's just been clobbered
in the spending review.

05:37.379 --> 05:38.483
Hang on a minute.

05:39.748 --> 05:41.887
Apparently,
the treasuy's way out of order.

05:41.917 --> 05:43.726
He says
they're simply out of control.

05:45.921 --> 05:48.697
Poor old Tubby,
he's hopping mad.

05:48.724 --> 05:51.432
Of course, he says he's bored
with his department.

05:51.460 --> 05:55.067
I think the problem is
he can't stand his minister.

06:34.269 --> 06:35.873
Hello, stranger.

06:35.904 --> 06:39.010
I know. Don't make me feel bad.

06:39.041 --> 06:40.816
It's been hectic at the paper.

06:40.842 --> 06:43.118
Lovely to see you.

06:43.145 --> 06:44.886
You must be Anna.

06:44.913 --> 06:46.620
Anna Barton, my mother.

06:46.648 --> 06:47.752
How are you?

06:48.850 --> 06:50.727
Come on through.

06:56.391 --> 06:58.337
Hello, Sally. Hi.

06:59.861 --> 07:02.034
What are you doing here?

07:02.064 --> 07:04.169
This is
my horrible little sister.

07:04.199 --> 07:05.678
Lunch is all ready.

07:05.701 --> 07:08.181
We're only here for a drink.

07:08.203 --> 07:10.012
We can't stop for lunch.

07:10.038 --> 07:12.951
Say hello to your father.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.954
Hi, Dad. This is Anna.

07:14.976 --> 07:16.455
My father.

07:16.478 --> 07:19.322
Let's have a drink,
and I'll show you around.

07:20.716 --> 07:22.218
Nice to meet you.

07:23.251 --> 07:25.356
Have you been all right?

07:25.387 --> 07:27.389
Yes, mostly.

07:28.457 --> 07:30.368
Tied up a lot
with the children's home.

07:30.392 --> 07:32.372
It's turning into a proper job.

07:32.394 --> 07:36.103
People ask me to do things.
I find it difficult to say no.

07:39.835 --> 07:42.111
Is she all right?

07:42.137 --> 07:44.174
She hasn't said anything.

07:44.206 --> 07:47.415
Are we going to go around
the garden all day?

07:47.442 --> 07:48.853
We have to go.

07:53.648 --> 07:54.854
Thank you for the drink.

07:54.883 --> 07:57.022
Not at all.

07:57.052 --> 07:59.191
It's always nice
to meet Martyn's friends.

08:04.493 --> 08:05.665
It was lovely.

08:05.694 --> 08:07.731
It was nice to see you, Ma.

08:28.950 --> 08:30.327
Bye.

08:36.591 --> 08:37.967
It was funny.

08:37.993 --> 08:41.600
The great joke was
he didn't spot it at auction.

08:42.631 --> 08:44.838
It was staring him in the face.

08:44.866 --> 08:47.039
It was Delft.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.570
1640s.

08:48.603 --> 08:50.514
He would have thrown it away.

08:54.509 --> 08:56.113
Thank you, Tommy.

08:56.144 --> 08:58.522
- I'm off to London.
- See you later.

09:25.540 --> 09:27.019
Miss Snow here.

09:27.042 --> 09:29.386
My name's Anna Barton.

09:29.411 --> 09:30.890
I'm a friend of the minister's.

09:30.912 --> 09:33.859
I was wondering
if I could have a word.

09:33.882 --> 09:36.829
Hold on.
I'll see if the minister's here.

09:48.563 --> 09:50.565
A Miss Barton for you.

09:56.438 --> 09:57.610
Put her through.

10:05.747 --> 10:06.919
It's Anna.

10:11.987 --> 10:13.193
Give me your address.

10:15.690 --> 10:17.260
I'll be there in an hour.

10:50.558 --> 10:51.730
Raymond.

15:07.182 --> 15:09.822
Mind you,
hysteria is perfectly treatable.

15:12.287 --> 15:13.789
I'm not very pleased about it.

15:13.821 --> 15:17.291
We'll get the bill through.
No doubt about that.

15:17.325 --> 15:19.066
We've got some worried masters.

15:24.232 --> 15:25.404
Excuse me, Dr. Fleming.

15:48.323 --> 15:49.996
This is a rare pleasure.

15:50.024 --> 15:52.868
I was hoping
we might have a word.

16:03.705 --> 16:05.207
Over here.

16:08.209 --> 16:11.019
I've got a new job.

16:11.045 --> 16:14.026
I've been made
the deputy political editor.

16:16.884 --> 16:19.763
That's wonderful.

16:19.787 --> 16:20.925
Already?

16:20.955 --> 16:22.434
I know.

16:22.457 --> 16:24.403
That's extraordinary.
You got it so young.

16:24.425 --> 16:28.396
I know. I'm going to have
to write about you.

16:29.864 --> 16:31.036
Try to be kind.

16:31.065 --> 16:32.908
I'll try to be objective.

16:36.204 --> 16:39.151
Ma insisted I come down
and tell you.

16:39.173 --> 16:40.948
She said you'd be thrilled.

16:40.975 --> 16:42.579
She's right. lam.

16:44.212 --> 16:46.192
Who else knows about this?

16:46.214 --> 16:47.659
Only Anna.

16:50.184 --> 16:52.460
It's great news.

16:52.487 --> 16:54.660
Ma's saying
we all have to go celebrate.

16:54.689 --> 16:57.260
She's right. We must.

16:57.292 --> 17:00.273
Nothing too rich.

17:00.295 --> 17:02.502
That's very safe.

17:08.903 --> 17:10.712
Here they come.
Welcome the hero.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.308
Hello, Grandpa.

17:12.339 --> 17:13.819
Congratulations.

17:13.840 --> 17:16.287
Well done.

17:16.310 --> 17:17.722
You don't know Edward.

17:17.744 --> 17:19.724
My grandfather.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.818
Gracious.
Is this your new friend?

17:21.848 --> 17:23.657
I'm honored.
I've read all about you.

17:23.685 --> 17:26.962
Please. Mine was
a very overrated career.

17:29.557 --> 17:33.437
Let's face it,
we look to Stephen.

17:33.461 --> 17:36.408
I'm afraid it was me that
forced him into politics...

17:36.431 --> 17:39.139
me and Ingrid, at least.

17:39.167 --> 17:42.376
I don't think he'd have
chosen the life himself.

17:42.403 --> 17:43.541
What will you drink?

17:43.571 --> 17:45.209
Champagne.

17:45.239 --> 17:47.185
Champagne, indeed.

17:47.208 --> 17:49.916
Well done.

17:49.944 --> 17:52.254
Well done in every respect.

17:54.315 --> 17:55.794
I was brought up abroad.

17:55.817 --> 17:57.626
My father was a diplomat.

17:57.652 --> 17:59.461
We almost never lived here.

18:00.488 --> 18:02.297
My mother's sort of...

18:02.323 --> 18:03.961
She's very French.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.303
And now,
she's with her fourth husband...

18:07.328 --> 18:09.501
and lives in Palm Springs.

18:09.530 --> 18:13.103
Palm Springs? Good gracious.

18:14.102 --> 18:15.945
So it was quite
an odd childhood.

18:15.970 --> 18:17.278
We moved about, yes.

18:17.305 --> 18:20.309
The Argentine, Africa.

18:20.341 --> 18:21.649
For a long time,
we were in Rome.

18:21.676 --> 18:24.987
Then, I don't know,
I moved to Paris.

18:25.012 --> 18:27.583
I wanted to be free.

18:27.615 --> 18:30.528
I even had a spell
as a waitress.

18:31.386 --> 18:33.832
When you're young...

18:33.855 --> 18:35.266
Then I'd ended a relationship.

18:35.289 --> 18:37.826
I moved to England
about three years ago.

18:39.460 --> 18:40.530
You live by yourself?

18:43.831 --> 18:45.367
Do you see your mother?

18:45.400 --> 18:46.845
It's turning into a grilling.

18:46.868 --> 18:48.279
Not at all.

18:48.302 --> 18:49.838
Anna's here to have a good time.

18:49.871 --> 18:51.043
But I am.

18:56.611 --> 18:58.488
Were you an only child?

18:59.480 --> 19:00.652
I had a brother.

19:02.817 --> 19:05.593
Anna's brother died.

19:05.620 --> 19:07.725
He killed himself when I was 15.

19:07.755 --> 19:10.065
I'm sorry.

19:10.091 --> 19:12.970
- How old was he?
- Sixteen.

19:12.994 --> 19:14.940
Did you see his body?

19:16.230 --> 19:17.402
What was it like?

19:17.432 --> 19:19.139
Rough.

19:22.937 --> 19:24.109
Why did he kill himself?

19:26.908 --> 19:28.080
Love.

19:37.151 --> 19:39.153
I've got to go back
to the office.

19:39.187 --> 19:41.497
I've got work to finish.

19:41.522 --> 19:42.694
Could I have the bill?

19:46.194 --> 19:48.003
Thank you
for such a lovely evening.

19:48.029 --> 19:49.838
Thank you.

19:49.864 --> 19:51.002
Good night.

19:51.032 --> 19:52.534
Good night, everyone.

19:59.373 --> 20:01.979
I don't trust her.

20:02.009 --> 20:04.512
Don't worry. I don't think
it's anything serious.

20:04.545 --> 20:07.355
I'll take the car.

20:07.381 --> 20:09.918
You go home with Raymond.
I've got to go vote.

20:11.152 --> 20:12.324
See you.

20:15.389 --> 20:16.868
How's that tummy?

20:16.991 --> 20:18.868
Full.

20:18.893 --> 20:20.167
Will you be all right?

20:20.194 --> 20:23.368
I'll be all right.

20:23.397 --> 20:24.899
Sleep well.

20:33.407 --> 20:35.751
I'll see you tomorrow.

21:23.891 --> 21:26.599
We've got to find
a structure for this.

21:33.834 --> 21:36.246
All through dinner, I just--

21:36.270 --> 21:39.376
I wanted to touch you.

21:39.407 --> 21:41.944
I wanted to hold you.

21:44.278 --> 21:45.780
You must never worry.

21:45.813 --> 21:47.486
I'll always be there.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.356
Who are you?

25:24.265 --> 25:26.211
Tell me about Aston.

25:26.233 --> 25:27.906
My brother and I?

25:29.370 --> 25:31.611
We were always together.

25:32.640 --> 25:34.483
Every few years,
there was a new country...

25:34.508 --> 25:38.354
or there was
a new language to learn...

25:39.947 --> 25:43.394
so, of course, Aston and I
grew closer and closer.

25:45.452 --> 25:49.400
We had nothing else,
just each other.

25:51.559 --> 25:52.731
I loved him...

25:58.165 --> 26:02.170
but he couldn't face the fact
that I was going to grow up.

26:05.606 --> 26:07.813
He couldn't let go of me.

26:08.976 --> 26:10.956
He wanted me all for himself...

26:15.449 --> 26:19.090
so it's made me terrified
of any kind of possessiveness.

26:23.023 --> 26:24.593
You see...

26:25.626 --> 26:27.367
if you can imagine...

26:28.829 --> 26:32.140
the worst thing
that could happen ever...

26:32.166 --> 26:33.804
in the whole of your life...

26:35.069 --> 26:37.379
well, that happened to me.

26:40.674 --> 26:42.813
My brother
killed himself over me.

26:48.482 --> 26:50.120
I had to decide.

26:51.318 --> 26:55.664
I made up my mind because
I could have gone under...

26:58.492 --> 26:59.835
but I wasn't going to.

27:04.765 --> 27:06.005
Remember--

27:07.167 --> 27:08.908
damaged people are dangerous.

27:10.137 --> 27:11.548
They know they can survive.

27:22.883 --> 27:24.055
Listen.

27:26.854 --> 27:29.698
I'm going to Brussels
this weekend for a conference.

27:33.093 --> 27:34.333
Come with me.

27:37.564 --> 27:39.566
I'm spending the weekend
with Martyn.

27:44.305 --> 27:47.616
You know I'll do anything.

27:47.641 --> 27:49.143
I've shown you.

27:52.379 --> 27:54.381
Please let it be.

27:55.482 --> 27:56.688
Don't change it.

28:18.806 --> 28:20.012
Morning, my dear.

28:22.576 --> 28:23.884
You all right?

28:23.911 --> 28:25.083
Very much so.

28:29.850 --> 28:31.022
Are you all packed?

28:32.453 --> 28:33.659
Raymond's out there.

28:37.858 --> 28:40.099
You two be all right
on your own?

28:40.127 --> 28:41.572
I expect so.

28:44.565 --> 28:46.738
You can always call Martyn...

28:46.767 --> 28:48.508
get him to come over.

28:48.535 --> 28:50.537
Didn't I tell you?

28:50.571 --> 28:51.914
They're going to Paris.

28:53.374 --> 28:55.115
Paris?

28:55.142 --> 28:56.815
I told you it was serious.

28:56.844 --> 28:58.414
The Lutetia Hotel.

28:58.445 --> 28:59.753
In my experience...

28:59.780 --> 29:01.782
people only go to Paris
for one thing.

29:01.815 --> 29:04.318
Thank you.

29:04.351 --> 29:05.796
I'll tell you what that is.

29:05.819 --> 29:07.890
We don't need to know.

29:09.156 --> 29:10.567
Are you off?

29:12.559 --> 29:14.061
Without a kiss?

29:16.363 --> 29:18.036
I'll see you Monday.

29:18.065 --> 29:19.942
I'll get breakfast on the plane.

29:41.855 --> 29:44.597
Gentlemen,
it is 5:00 in the morning.

29:44.625 --> 29:48.198
It is clear we'll get
no further agreement.

29:48.228 --> 29:49.866
Therefore,
I would like to suggest...

29:49.897 --> 29:52.468
a resumption
after a short time...

29:52.499 --> 29:53.705
School's out.

29:53.734 --> 29:57.147
To rethink our position
after some much-needed sleep.

29:57.171 --> 29:59.378
The meeting is now adjourned.

30:04.578 --> 30:08.321
Thank God for that--
12 hours recess.

30:10.384 --> 30:11.863
I think I'll walk.

30:11.885 --> 30:13.364
Are you sure?

30:13.387 --> 30:14.991
Absolutely.
See Brussels at dawn.

30:15.022 --> 30:16.365
Come on.

30:16.390 --> 30:18.529
Really. I need the exercise.

30:18.559 --> 30:20.402
It's up to you.

30:20.427 --> 30:21.599
See you later.

30:43.851 --> 30:45.660
La gare, s'il vous plait,
pour Paris.

31:22.956 --> 31:24.993
Hotel Lutetia, bonjour.

31:25.025 --> 31:27.767
Mademoiselle Barton,
s'il vous plait.

31:27.794 --> 31:30.070
Mademoiselle Barton?

31:30.097 --> 31:32.441
Elle est avec
un Monsieur Fleming.

31:56.156 --> 31:57.658
C'est pour Mademoiselle Barton.

32:08.202 --> 32:10.842
Turn left outside the hotel.

32:12.039 --> 32:13.541
Take the first street
on the left.

32:13.574 --> 32:14.985
Go to the end.

32:16.743 --> 32:17.983
I'll be by the church.

32:19.379 --> 32:21.017
Bien. Merci.

33:31.885 --> 33:33.387
I love you.

33:35.989 --> 33:37.593
I know.

34:15.728 --> 34:18.471
I can't see past you.

34:20.867 --> 34:23.473
I think
you've never seen much at all.

34:36.717 --> 34:37.991
I have to go back.

34:42.889 --> 34:44.458
He's still asleep.

35:00.540 --> 35:02.645
Don't follow us...please.

35:23.930 --> 35:25.375
Hotel Lutetia, bonjour.

35:30.437 --> 35:32.849
I would like a room for the day.

35:32.873 --> 35:34.147
For one person?

35:38.779 --> 35:40.884
Et une petit dejeuner...

35:43.250 --> 35:44.888
Des oeufs de jambon...

35:44.918 --> 35:47.398
du cafe, du pain,
des croissants.

35:52.359 --> 35:53.565
Et aussi, s'il vous plait...

35:53.593 --> 35:55.504
une bonne bouteille
de vin rouge.

37:57.951 --> 38:00.363
Look who's here. How are you?

38:01.454 --> 38:02.592
Brussels all right?

38:02.622 --> 38:04.295
I was bringing Raymond in
for some breakfast.

38:04.324 --> 38:06.031
He had to meet me so early.

38:06.059 --> 38:07.402
I can do without.

38:08.828 --> 38:10.739
I'll do anything for you.

38:16.469 --> 38:17.641
Who's that?

38:18.638 --> 38:20.276
His name is Henry.

38:20.307 --> 38:22.719
He slept over this weekend.

38:22.742 --> 38:25.086
Sally's in love.

38:25.111 --> 38:26.886
In love?

38:30.350 --> 38:32.227
That's the last time
I leave this house.

38:37.324 --> 38:38.803
Check the mark.

38:38.825 --> 38:40.896
It is.

38:40.927 --> 38:42.099
Will you hand me that?

38:46.266 --> 38:48.473
- Hold on.
- This one?

38:48.501 --> 38:51.505
There's a call for you on three.

38:51.538 --> 38:52.710
"Seven-three-one"?

38:52.739 --> 38:53.911
That's the one.

39:04.317 --> 39:06.092
I need to see you.

39:06.119 --> 39:07.325
Of course.

39:08.655 --> 39:10.225
At lunchtime.

39:10.256 --> 39:11.428
Where?

39:12.559 --> 39:15.472
Somewhere public.

39:15.495 --> 39:17.133
Oh, my God. Again?

39:17.163 --> 39:19.643
It's not what you're thinking.

39:19.666 --> 39:22.146
It's a different matter.

39:22.168 --> 39:25.479
It's difficult to explain
over the phone.

39:25.505 --> 39:27.644
I'll tell you more
when I see you.

39:27.674 --> 39:29.654
I'll call you back later.

39:29.676 --> 39:31.053
All right.

39:35.849 --> 39:37.624
Would you sign these for me?

39:38.852 --> 39:40.695
Certainly.

39:52.399 --> 39:54.902
I brought some sandwiches.

39:54.934 --> 39:57.380
I thought it was going
to be a nice day.

40:02.909 --> 40:04.786
I've been thinking
about what we should do.

40:04.811 --> 40:05.983
Do?

40:07.614 --> 40:09.685
I have to leave Ingrid.

40:09.716 --> 40:10.854
There's no doubt about that.

40:10.884 --> 40:13.330
It's the right thing
for everybody.

40:15.522 --> 40:16.967
I can't go on...

40:18.491 --> 40:19.765
not like this.

40:19.793 --> 40:22.603
What happened in Paris...

40:25.065 --> 40:26.373
The way I behaved.

40:27.801 --> 40:29.747
I've never had feelings
like this.

40:32.338 --> 40:34.181
I have to get them
into some sort of...

40:35.775 --> 40:37.448
order.

40:40.513 --> 40:43.722
I know it'll be hard for Martyn.
He's fond of you.

40:43.750 --> 40:44.922
He loves me.

40:45.952 --> 40:49.593
I know, but he's young.
He'll get over it.

40:49.622 --> 40:51.363
He's your son.

40:51.391 --> 40:52.563
He'd hate you.

40:54.394 --> 40:55.702
He'd hate me for a while, but--

40:55.729 --> 40:58.767
You'd lose him.
You'd lose your own son?

40:59.799 --> 41:03.269
You'd also destroy the life
you've made with Ingrid.

41:03.303 --> 41:04.680
It's a good life.

41:05.839 --> 41:07.819
What you say doesn't make sense.

41:10.043 --> 41:11.386
How come you're so sure?

41:11.411 --> 41:14.358
Because in your heart,
you don't even want it.

41:14.380 --> 41:16.690
You want us to start
eating breakfast together?

41:16.716 --> 41:18.286
I'd like that.

41:18.318 --> 41:21.026
You'd like it
if we lived in the same house...

41:21.054 --> 41:22.692
read the papers together?

41:25.258 --> 41:28.000
What would you gain
if you left Ingrid?

41:28.027 --> 41:29.438
I'd gain you.

41:29.462 --> 41:32.534
You'd be gaining something
you already have.

41:49.816 --> 41:50.988
When can you see me?

41:54.053 --> 41:55.225
Thursday.

42:00.393 --> 42:03.397
Thursday at five o'clock.

42:07.967 --> 42:11.380
I feel very optimistic
about these new developments.

42:11.404 --> 42:15.546
We set some new targets
in the area of industrial waste.

42:15.575 --> 42:16.883
These are not just talk.

42:16.910 --> 42:20.016
These are targets which are
sensible and realistic.

42:20.046 --> 42:22.390
Are you saying
that some serious commitments...

42:22.415 --> 42:24.895
actually emerged
from the Brussels talks?

42:24.918 --> 42:26.397
Brussels was good.

42:26.419 --> 42:30.265
It laid out a European agenda.

42:30.290 --> 42:32.531
We have to face the fact
that toxic waste...

42:32.559 --> 42:35.870
is no respecter
of national frontiers.

42:35.895 --> 42:39.399
Problems such as acid rain,
ocean pollution...

42:39.432 --> 42:41.412
the diminishing ozone layer...

42:41.434 --> 42:44.904
cannot be tackled
by one country on its own.

42:44.938 --> 42:46.417
There must be cooperation...

42:46.439 --> 42:48.851
between the member states
of the community.

42:48.875 --> 42:51.185
Are you really trying
to make out...

42:51.211 --> 42:54.158
that for once Britain
isn't dragging its heels?

42:54.180 --> 42:56.421
I don't think we ever were.

42:56.449 --> 42:59.362
It's an image
we became saddled with...

42:59.385 --> 43:02.025
but when is an image
ever the truth?

43:10.096 --> 43:11.268
That was pretty good.

43:13.433 --> 43:14.878
Don't tell me you were watching.

43:14.901 --> 43:16.380
Of course.

43:16.402 --> 43:18.848
I never miss a performance.

43:21.007 --> 43:22.418
You are extraordinary.

43:24.410 --> 43:25.912
So are you.

43:30.049 --> 43:31.392
It's a real gift.

43:32.919 --> 43:34.330
Being good at things.

43:37.490 --> 43:39.436
Somehow I remember
what I first saw in you...

43:41.594 --> 43:43.096
when you were a doctor...

43:44.931 --> 43:47.036
doing simple things well.

43:52.538 --> 43:53.949
I do love that.

43:59.846 --> 44:01.450
I still love that.

44:39.218 --> 44:41.323
I was expecting you.
Please come on in.

44:45.325 --> 44:47.669
Do you know Peter Wetzlar?

44:47.694 --> 44:50.231
I don't.

44:50.263 --> 44:52.072
This is Martyn's father.

44:54.133 --> 44:55.305
Peter stopped by.

44:58.871 --> 45:00.373
He lives in Paris.

45:09.615 --> 45:11.652
What brings you to London?

45:13.386 --> 45:14.888
The museum.

45:18.057 --> 45:19.866
What particular field?

45:19.892 --> 45:22.304
Chinese artifacts.

45:22.328 --> 45:23.830
The Han dynasty.

45:24.931 --> 45:26.842
He hasn't changed.

45:26.866 --> 45:29.346
He never warns you when
he's going to drop by.

45:29.369 --> 45:31.076
I didn't know
until the last moment...

45:31.104 --> 45:34.085
so I'm riding my luck,
as usual.

45:37.410 --> 45:38.946
I'll go and get your book.

45:38.978 --> 45:40.184
I'm sorry?

45:41.180 --> 45:43.126
Stephen's come around
for this book.

45:43.149 --> 45:44.958
It's out of print.

45:44.984 --> 45:46.930
I won't be a moment.
I put it aside.

45:53.593 --> 45:54.765
You know Anna well?

45:56.562 --> 45:58.337
I mean...

45:58.364 --> 46:00.310
we've been through
quite a lot together.

46:02.535 --> 46:03.980
She's still my best friend,
I guess.

46:05.538 --> 46:08.644
I liked your son.

46:08.674 --> 46:09.846
You met him?

46:11.210 --> 46:12.951
In Paris.

46:12.979 --> 46:17.519
It was important, I think,
for Anna.

46:18.584 --> 46:19.824
How do you mean?

46:19.852 --> 46:21.195
You know how it is.

46:21.220 --> 46:23.826
You feel you have to bring
all the bits together.

46:25.058 --> 46:27.834
I don't think I quite
know how you mean.

46:27.860 --> 46:30.602
She's getting
pretty serious with Martyn.

46:30.630 --> 46:31.870
She loves him.

46:33.066 --> 46:34.443
I'm sure
it's a very good thing...

46:34.467 --> 46:38.210
because he seems to know
how to handle her...

46:38.237 --> 46:41.150
to give her the freedom
she really needs.

46:42.542 --> 46:43.748
I never could.

46:46.112 --> 46:47.216
I see.

46:48.147 --> 46:50.821
So perhaps she'll be happy.

46:50.850 --> 46:52.887
God knows she deserves it.

46:52.919 --> 46:54.091
She does.

46:55.421 --> 46:57.799
- What's the book?
- Book?

46:57.824 --> 46:59.804
You came to pick up a book.

46:59.826 --> 47:01.271
It's just something I...

47:01.294 --> 47:03.001
Here it is.

47:03.029 --> 47:04.770
Thank you.

47:04.797 --> 47:06.299
This is it.

47:07.400 --> 47:08.743
I couldn't get it.

47:08.768 --> 47:10.042
Have it for as long as you like.

47:10.069 --> 47:11.275
Thank you.

47:12.505 --> 47:14.849
I won't intrude any longer.

47:14.874 --> 47:16.478
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to bust in.

47:16.509 --> 47:17.852
Not at all.

47:20.012 --> 47:21.355
Very nice to meet you.

47:21.380 --> 47:22.552
Nice meeting you.

47:24.217 --> 47:28.063
I hope we all see you sometime.

48:25.378 --> 48:26.755
Thank you for the book.

48:28.548 --> 48:29.891
What was that all about?

48:36.189 --> 48:37.361
Who is that man?

48:43.062 --> 48:45.804
I was with Peter
the night Aston died.

48:48.467 --> 48:50.913
Peter's someone
I'll know forever.

48:59.912 --> 49:01.823
Our parents were friends.

49:01.847 --> 49:03.190
We'd had the same life.

49:05.484 --> 49:07.623
One evening,
he took me out dancing.

49:09.322 --> 49:11.461
I was 15.

49:12.491 --> 49:15.335
Peter brought me home
in his car...

49:15.361 --> 49:17.466
and he started to kiss me.

49:22.635 --> 49:25.582
I didn't know Aston
was watching.

49:25.605 --> 49:28.677
Aston was watching
from a window upstairs.

49:30.009 --> 49:33.752
When I went in,
he started to go mad.

49:33.779 --> 49:36.885
"You're going to let him fuck you.
They're all going to fuck you," he said.

49:36.916 --> 49:38.896
"It's the end for us."

49:41.320 --> 49:43.322
He came to my room.

49:43.356 --> 49:45.996
He wanted to sleep in my bed.

49:46.025 --> 49:48.733
All I knew was
I had to get him out.

49:48.761 --> 49:50.206
I locked the door.

49:51.697 --> 49:53.836
I heard him outside.

49:53.866 --> 49:56.346
He started imploring me,
begging me...

49:56.369 --> 49:58.645
saying he was sorry,
would I forgive him?

49:58.671 --> 50:00.412
I just listened.

50:03.709 --> 50:05.780
For hours, I listened.

50:08.381 --> 50:09.883
Then it stopped.

50:12.585 --> 50:13.757
I went to sleep.

50:15.817 --> 50:20.288
Next morning, I woke, and...
I heard owing.

50:20.321 --> 50:21.823
I went down the corridor.

50:21.856 --> 50:24.735
They all told me not to go in,
but I did...

50:26.627 --> 50:28.732
and I saw Aston.

50:34.669 --> 50:36.410
He'd cut his wrists.

50:46.381 --> 50:48.622
I took his head in my arms.

50:50.852 --> 50:53.298
His face had been
under the water...

50:54.455 --> 50:55.866
and the water was red.

51:00.695 --> 51:01.901
They said we had to leave.

51:01.929 --> 51:04.239
They took me and my mother
to stay with Peter's parents.

51:04.265 --> 51:06.575
They wanted us out of the house.

51:08.036 --> 51:09.606
Peter was waiting.

51:10.872 --> 51:12.317
He took me upstairs.

51:14.208 --> 51:17.087
My nightdress was still
covered with blood.

51:20.381 --> 51:22.361
It was then...

51:24.886 --> 51:27.423
I had to. I knew I had to.

51:29.824 --> 51:31.735
I asked him to fuck me.

51:34.929 --> 51:36.431
"Fuck me," I said.

52:15.136 --> 52:16.342
It's all right.

53:44.697 --> 53:46.734
I don't mind her being there.

53:46.765 --> 53:49.075
I really don't mind.

53:49.101 --> 53:52.878
It's just...
I wish Martyn had asked us.

53:54.940 --> 53:58.410
Suddenly she seems to be part
of our lives, which is fine.

53:59.578 --> 54:00.921
It's just this weekend.

54:00.946 --> 54:05.691
It's Hartley, which Martyn knows
is my favorite place on Earth...

54:05.718 --> 54:07.322
and it's my birthday.

54:09.088 --> 54:12.092
It makes me sound mean,
which I hate.

54:14.360 --> 54:17.569
I don't know.
She brings out the worst in me.

54:19.131 --> 54:20.940
Don't worry. It'll be fine.

54:24.670 --> 54:28.208
This is a portrait of Ingrid's
great-great-grandmother.

54:29.508 --> 54:31.419
Was Ingrid brought up here?

54:31.443 --> 54:33.116
Of course.

54:33.145 --> 54:36.251
There have been Lloyds here
for over 200 years.

54:36.282 --> 54:39.752
Ingrid's my only child,
so it falls now to Martyn.

54:39.785 --> 54:43.255
Martyn and his family
will inherit this place.

54:43.289 --> 54:44.495
Meanwhile, I'm by myself.

54:44.523 --> 54:46.764
That's why these weekends
are so wonderful.

54:46.792 --> 54:48.601
Grandpa!

54:48.627 --> 54:52.837
I assume you'll be back many
times and always be welcome.

54:52.865 --> 54:54.344
Won't she, Ingrid?

54:55.067 --> 54:56.569
Thank you, darling.

54:58.804 --> 55:01.580
This is the most
extraordinary place.

55:03.576 --> 55:06.147
You're not convinced?

55:06.178 --> 55:09.387
I was always made to come here
for the holidays.

55:09.415 --> 55:12.259
That isn't fair.

55:14.286 --> 55:16.391
While, of course,
the company was fine...

55:16.422 --> 55:17.696
I should hope.

55:17.723 --> 55:20.260
My childhood
wasn't all wonderful.

55:20.292 --> 55:22.272
Really?

55:25.798 --> 55:27.971
As a matter of fact, it wasn't.

55:28.968 --> 55:32.575
Perhaps...I don't know,
perhaps it was...

55:32.605 --> 55:34.346
Perhaps it was too perfect--

55:34.373 --> 55:36.717
nothing was to disturb
the surface of things.

55:36.742 --> 55:38.915
Everything was fine...

55:38.944 --> 55:40.787
no questions.

55:42.147 --> 55:43.319
It isn't healthy.

55:47.419 --> 55:49.456
That's all I'm saying.
It's not a big issue.

55:49.488 --> 55:51.024
But it's good to have roots.

55:51.056 --> 55:53.366
But roots aren't that great...

55:53.392 --> 55:55.372
unless something else
comes with them.

55:57.529 --> 55:59.702
- Like what?
- I don't know.

55:59.732 --> 56:02.269
Warmth, I suppose.

56:03.335 --> 56:04.507
Passion.

56:06.739 --> 56:08.650
It was probably my fault.

56:10.776 --> 56:13.450
It came more from Dad,
if I have to name anyone.

56:27.026 --> 56:30.064
They make a wonderful couple,
don't they?

56:30.095 --> 56:31.438
Granddad.

56:34.099 --> 56:36.375
Good night, you old devil.

56:39.438 --> 56:41.418
You'll sleep well in this room.

56:41.440 --> 56:43.613
It's one of my favorites.

57:31.423 --> 57:33.300
Right, now concentrate.

57:33.325 --> 57:36.795
Put your arm here,
hand on there, and look there...

57:36.829 --> 57:38.331
and look up.

57:40.499 --> 57:41.978
Close.

57:42.000 --> 57:43.377
Come on here.

57:47.306 --> 57:48.649
Had a good walk?

57:52.277 --> 57:53.449
Who's winning?

57:53.479 --> 57:55.823
I think Martyn
is winning everything.

58:05.891 --> 58:07.427
This house was full...

58:07.459 --> 58:10.440
It was full every weekend.

58:10.462 --> 58:11.702
There we are.

58:11.730 --> 58:13.107
I thought Bob Marley was dead.

58:13.132 --> 58:14.440
Of course he's dead.

58:14.466 --> 58:16.173
Then why...

58:16.201 --> 58:18.112
Ingrid's mother
loved entertaining.

58:18.137 --> 58:19.275
Happy birthday.

58:19.304 --> 58:23.753
Politicians, of course,
and artists came, writers also.

58:23.776 --> 58:26.950
Boundless hospitality!

58:26.979 --> 58:29.858
My wife understood that.

58:29.882 --> 58:33.125
Life's pretty empty without her.

58:33.152 --> 58:35.291
That's why I'm so pleased...

58:35.320 --> 58:37.493
I'm so pleased for both of you.

58:38.991 --> 58:40.163
Am I going too far?

58:40.192 --> 58:41.967
Not yet, but you may soon.

58:41.994 --> 58:43.974
I doubt it.

58:43.996 --> 58:47.239
Come along,
I think we've all guessed.

58:47.266 --> 58:51.078
I assumed that's why you brought
Anna along.

58:51.103 --> 58:52.309
Please!

58:52.337 --> 58:54.715
Can't you see you're
embarrassing Martyn and Anna?

58:54.740 --> 58:58.517
Not at all. Far from it.

58:59.678 --> 59:02.659
Since Grandfather has said...

59:02.681 --> 59:05.252
I've just asked Anna
to marry me...

59:05.284 --> 59:09.426
and I'm pleased to say
she said yes.

59:14.059 --> 59:15.663
Oh, my God.

59:21.400 --> 59:25.314
It's really marvelous.

59:28.440 --> 59:30.681
We both think that's wonderful.

59:30.709 --> 59:31.949
Congratulations, my dear.

59:31.977 --> 59:34.617
Thank you. It's very sudden.

59:35.614 --> 59:36.957
We're taken aback.

59:36.982 --> 59:38.325
But you're pleased?

59:40.485 --> 59:41.930
Of course.

59:42.988 --> 59:44.365
Delighted.

59:45.524 --> 59:47.663
I do mean for both of you.

59:47.693 --> 59:49.104
Congratulations--
I'm sorry.

59:49.127 --> 59:50.606
Clumsy. All right.

59:50.629 --> 59:52.973
I was always sure
you two had this in mind.

59:52.998 --> 59:56.377
I'm pleased I've hastened
the announcement.

59:56.401 --> 59:58.142
You have.

59:59.171 --> 01:00:00.650
Let's drink a toast.

01:00:00.672 --> 01:00:04.245
Come on, children...
to Martyn and Anna.

01:00:15.721 --> 01:00:17.166
When did you ask?

01:00:18.824 --> 01:00:19.996
When did you ask Anna?

01:00:20.025 --> 01:00:22.972
It was a few days ago.

01:00:24.396 --> 01:00:26.307
She accepted straight-away?

01:00:32.437 --> 01:00:35.418
I know I've hurt you.

01:00:36.508 --> 01:00:38.010
All that stuff
at dinner last night.

01:00:38.043 --> 01:00:40.114
I don't know what that was.

01:00:40.145 --> 01:00:41.351
It's all right.

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:44.122
The funny thing is that today
I feel very close to you.

01:00:45.617 --> 01:00:46.789
Heads or tails?

01:00:47.753 --> 01:00:48.959
Tails.

01:00:50.255 --> 01:00:51.563
Tails.

01:00:53.358 --> 01:00:55.838
And Mum--
I know I'm hurting her, but...

01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:58.705
whoever I married,
it was going to be hard.

01:00:58.730 --> 01:01:01.336
I can tell
she's worried about Anna.

01:01:03.001 --> 01:01:06.847
I think she's worried
you're taking on a lot.

01:01:06.872 --> 01:01:10.445
But you have to see that
that's why I'm drawn to her.

01:01:10.475 --> 01:01:14.890
There's a sadness...in her.

01:01:14.913 --> 01:01:18.292
I don't know why,
but it's very interesting.

01:01:21.153 --> 01:01:23.565
I've discovered I can help her,
and that's great.

01:01:23.588 --> 01:01:25.090
It's the best feeling.

01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:27.802
Makes you sound like a nurse.

01:01:33.031 --> 01:01:36.103
I'm not trying to stop you.

01:01:36.134 --> 01:01:37.772
I like Anna.
I really do...

01:01:37.803 --> 01:01:43.754
but are you sure
she's really what you want?

01:01:43.775 --> 01:01:46.312
You don't know her.

01:01:46.345 --> 01:01:48.154
There's a whole side to her...

01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:50.023
that's only there
when we're alone.

01:01:50.048 --> 01:01:52.858
If you could see that,
then you'd feel differently.

01:01:57.322 --> 01:02:00.462
When we're alone,
she's like no one else.

01:05:24.362 --> 01:05:26.342
Sir, I tried to find
all the people you asked for.

01:05:26.364 --> 01:05:27.502
I hope so.

01:05:27.532 --> 01:05:29.273
- Sir, will you need me?
- I need everybody.

01:05:30.468 --> 01:05:31.742
Good morning, sir.

01:05:37.609 --> 01:05:39.987
Do you know
what I think of that?

01:05:40.011 --> 01:05:42.924
Sir, before we start,
I'd like to apologize--

01:05:42.948 --> 01:05:46.122
This is supposed to be
a final draft...

01:05:46.151 --> 01:05:48.757
a ministry position paper...

01:05:48.787 --> 01:05:51.529
and it's full
of major factual errors.

01:05:53.792 --> 01:05:56.864
But what really irritates me
is that I'm the one...

01:05:56.895 --> 01:05:58.738
who has to stand up
in Parliament...

01:05:58.763 --> 01:06:01.266
and if I've been
wrongly briefed...

01:06:01.299 --> 01:06:05.008
then it's me
that gets it in the neck.

01:06:06.204 --> 01:06:08.707
It's all very well for you lot.
You shelter behind the woodwork.

01:06:08.740 --> 01:06:10.219
You wander in here and say...

01:06:10.242 --> 01:06:12.916
"Sorry, we slipped up
on the ozone figures..."

01:06:12.944 --> 01:06:14.446
but it's my job!

01:06:15.614 --> 01:06:17.594
Has that occurred to you?

01:06:17.616 --> 01:06:20.256
If I hadn't spotted
your hall's up...

01:06:20.285 --> 01:06:21.559
then my job
would've been on the line.

01:06:21.586 --> 01:06:22.997
Do you know that?

01:06:25.757 --> 01:06:28.260
You're redrafting?

01:06:28.293 --> 01:06:30.204
- Already.
- Good.

01:06:34.799 --> 01:06:37.211
That's it. I'm done.

01:06:47.379 --> 01:06:48.824
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

01:07:04.996 --> 01:07:06.168
Where's your mother?

01:07:07.699 --> 01:07:09.701
Work, I suppose.
I haven't seen her.

01:07:11.403 --> 01:07:12.575
No Henry tonight?

01:07:18.743 --> 01:07:21.417
Sal...I wanted a word.

01:07:23.648 --> 01:07:25.559
You know when I saw you
at Hartley the other night...

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:27.221
on the stairs?

01:07:28.987 --> 01:07:33.197
I'd had to talk to Anna.

01:07:33.224 --> 01:07:34.703
That's what I was doing.

01:07:36.728 --> 01:07:38.071
Your mum's a bit upset.

01:07:38.096 --> 01:07:40.872
You've probably sensed that.

01:07:42.067 --> 01:07:44.069
And...

01:07:44.102 --> 01:07:46.878
I was trying to bring
all the parties together.

01:07:57.048 --> 01:07:58.220
I'm going to bed.

01:08:13.164 --> 01:08:15.371
Oh, dear. Not a bit.

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:17.380
I just love it.

01:08:17.402 --> 01:08:20.178
Would you at least choose
the music for the wedding?

01:08:20.205 --> 01:08:21.377
You should.

01:08:21.406 --> 01:08:23.386
I suppose so.

01:08:23.408 --> 01:08:25.149
She doesn't trust me, though.

01:08:25.176 --> 01:08:26.712
I'm so sorry I'm late.

01:08:26.745 --> 01:08:28.053
That's all right.

01:08:28.078 --> 01:08:30.992
- We started without you.
- Good.

01:08:31.015 --> 01:08:32.551
Mrs. Prideaux,
welcome to London.

01:08:32.584 --> 01:08:35.087
Thank you. How do you do?

01:08:36.087 --> 01:08:37.259
How are you?

01:08:38.857 --> 01:08:42.566
I was just saying lam
so thrilled at this occasion.

01:08:42.594 --> 01:08:45.073
Thrilled for Anna, of course.

01:08:45.095 --> 01:08:46.301
One way or another...

01:08:46.331 --> 01:08:48.242
I haven't seen
much of her lately...

01:08:48.265 --> 01:08:51.406
so it always moves me
so much when I do.

01:08:52.871 --> 01:08:55.852
Thank you.

01:08:55.874 --> 01:08:57.911
And one look at Martyn...

01:08:57.942 --> 01:09:00.149
- My goodness.
- I know.

01:09:01.613 --> 01:09:03.149
I feel flattered.

01:09:04.416 --> 01:09:07.192
Though, of course,
he's not Anna's usual type.

01:09:08.086 --> 01:09:09.258
I'm sorry?

01:09:10.955 --> 01:09:12.798
If I may say that.

01:09:12.823 --> 01:09:15.930
Anna's first boyfriend
did set a sort of pattern--

01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:18.702
tormented, difficult.

01:09:19.831 --> 01:09:22.743
And all the others
have followed from there.

01:09:22.767 --> 01:09:24.303
Are you talking about Peter?

01:09:27.639 --> 01:09:30.051
I've met him.
He seems very nice.

01:09:30.073 --> 01:09:31.484
He is.

01:09:32.944 --> 01:09:34.321
I miss him.

01:09:38.082 --> 01:09:39.925
Mother, everything's fine.

01:09:45.823 --> 01:09:46.962
How's the salmon?

01:09:46.991 --> 01:09:48.334
Good.

01:09:52.729 --> 01:09:55.040
When Peter and Anna broke up...

01:09:55.066 --> 01:09:58.377
Peter got married
to a brilliant young lawyer--

01:09:58.403 --> 01:10:00.280
a striking-looking girl--

01:10:00.305 --> 01:10:02.376
but it only lasted eight weeks.

01:10:02.407 --> 01:10:04.887
I can't boast.

01:10:04.909 --> 01:10:07.412
My own record
isn't much better than that.

01:10:07.445 --> 01:10:09.447
You've been married a few times?

01:10:12.083 --> 01:10:13.721
Good Lord!

01:10:13.751 --> 01:10:16.254
And one nearly in Reno.

01:10:16.287 --> 01:10:19.029
We went as far
as the Chapel of Love...

01:10:19.057 --> 01:10:20.764
and then I got cold feet.

01:10:20.792 --> 01:10:24.035
Thank goodness. Otherwise,
it would have been five.

01:10:28.366 --> 01:10:30.903
Of course, it's hard for us.

01:10:30.935 --> 01:10:32.676
I'm sure Anna has told you.

01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:36.512
Told us?

01:10:37.909 --> 01:10:39.616
About the brother she had.

01:10:53.124 --> 01:10:55.468
Of course, it strikes me.

01:10:55.493 --> 01:10:59.202
It had to strike me,
looking at Martyn.

01:11:01.032 --> 01:11:03.808
He does look
so like Anna's brother.

01:11:11.843 --> 01:11:13.948
I don't know
if you realized that.

01:11:20.184 --> 01:11:22.960
Not, of course,
that Aston was as handsome.

01:11:22.987 --> 01:11:25.991
Why do you always
make it worse for me?

01:11:26.024 --> 01:11:27.731
Do you think
it isn't bad enough?

01:11:27.759 --> 01:11:30.740
Do you think I constantly
need to be reminded?

01:11:34.065 --> 01:11:36.011
I'm sorry, I'm sure.

01:11:39.237 --> 01:11:41.649
Perhaps this is why
we shouldn't meet.

01:11:51.583 --> 01:11:53.529
It's all right.

01:11:55.019 --> 01:11:56.327
Really, it's fine.

01:12:19.143 --> 01:12:21.521
I think I made a bad impression.

01:12:21.546 --> 01:12:25.119
I'm afraid your wife
didn't look very pleased.

01:12:25.149 --> 01:12:26.958
I was nervous.
That was the trouble.

01:12:26.985 --> 01:12:29.625
It was fine, really.
We both enjoyed meeting you.

01:12:29.654 --> 01:12:31.656
But I'm not nervous now.

01:12:33.224 --> 01:12:37.070
You must realize,
this is a chance for Anna.

01:12:37.095 --> 01:12:38.938
At last, with Martyn,
she has a chance.

01:12:38.963 --> 01:12:40.601
She can make a new life.

01:12:41.733 --> 01:12:44.976
It would be too bad
if anything prevented her.

01:12:47.438 --> 01:12:49.384
I'm not sure I understand
what you mean.

01:12:50.942 --> 01:12:52.478
I think you do.

01:12:53.478 --> 01:12:55.788
I watched you
throughout the meal.

01:12:56.781 --> 01:12:58.590
You can't even look at her.

01:13:03.321 --> 01:13:05.562
You must get out of the way.

01:13:07.425 --> 01:13:09.098
I'm asking you.

01:13:11.095 --> 01:13:12.438
Please.

01:13:33.751 --> 01:13:35.287
I won't speak of this again.

01:13:37.121 --> 01:13:38.293
Thank you.

01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:45.630
The ministry, sir?

01:13:46.898 --> 01:13:48.605
Just drive around for a while.

01:14:07.085 --> 01:14:09.087
I need to get out.

01:14:20.998 --> 01:14:22.272
I won't be a minute.

01:14:37.448 --> 01:14:38.927
It's me. Don't say anything.

01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:40.361
I don't want you
to say anything.

01:14:42.954 --> 01:14:44.490
I have to let you go.

01:14:46.791 --> 01:14:50.000
It's the right thing to do
for Martyn and for you.

01:14:52.430 --> 01:14:54.171
We both know
it's the right thing.

01:14:55.233 --> 01:14:56.439
It's got to stop.

01:14:58.903 --> 01:15:00.576
I am sorry.

01:15:23.194 --> 01:15:25.435
- To the ministry now, sir?
- City Road.

01:15:40.812 --> 01:15:42.450
Do you know where I can find
Martyn Fleming?

01:15:47.118 --> 01:15:48.222
Over here.

01:15:51.489 --> 01:15:53.093
- Thank you.
- I'll tell him you're here.

01:16:14.412 --> 01:16:15.618
Why don't you have it?

01:16:17.014 --> 01:16:18.186
May l7

01:16:19.317 --> 01:16:20.660
Are you sure?

01:16:21.886 --> 01:16:24.765
What brings you here?

01:16:26.424 --> 01:16:29.428
Sentiment.

01:16:36.968 --> 01:16:38.140
Feeling...

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:44.949
that I haven't behaved
as I should.

01:16:52.383 --> 01:16:56.889
You know what you were saying
in Hartley about...passion?

01:16:58.823 --> 01:17:00.564
You were right.

01:17:02.126 --> 01:17:04.197
I was distant.

01:17:04.228 --> 01:17:06.230
I know I was.

01:17:07.231 --> 01:17:10.906
I thought
you could control life...

01:17:13.738 --> 01:17:15.945
but it's not like that.

01:17:17.141 --> 01:17:18.313
There are things you...

01:17:21.112 --> 01:17:23.149
There are things
you can't control.

01:17:24.548 --> 01:17:26.494
That's right.

01:17:29.687 --> 01:17:31.166
Somehow you know that.

01:17:34.659 --> 01:17:36.730
I came to wish you both
good luck.

01:17:38.162 --> 01:17:39.436
Are these for me?

01:17:44.602 --> 01:17:46.843
I really appreciate this.

01:17:46.871 --> 01:17:48.475
It's very kind. Thank you.

01:17:54.679 --> 01:17:57.285
The piece doesn't fit,
that's the problem.

01:17:57.315 --> 01:17:59.352
We need something out--
200 words or so.

01:17:59.383 --> 01:18:01.385
Sorry. I see.

01:18:11.395 --> 01:18:13.534
I love all this.

01:18:13.564 --> 01:18:16.477
I think it's wonderful.
I love all this.

01:18:36.587 --> 01:18:38.260
You're still there.

01:18:43.594 --> 01:18:46.871
Everyone's here.
We're just about to go in.

01:18:46.897 --> 01:18:48.877
I'm sorry.

01:18:51.602 --> 01:18:53.172
We're struggling
with this redrafting.

01:18:53.204 --> 01:18:55.912
Everybody's here--
Donald, Trevor...

01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:58.420
We've got to get it done
tonight.

01:19:01.412 --> 01:19:02.857
I'll keep your food hot.

01:19:02.880 --> 01:19:04.052
Fine.

01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:08.062
I'll get back as quick as I can.

01:19:46.690 --> 01:19:48.294
I just heard from Edward.

01:19:50.061 --> 01:19:52.234
He says the word is they're
going to offer you Health.

01:19:53.564 --> 01:19:55.168
That means
you'd be in the cabinet.

01:19:57.868 --> 01:20:00.405
When did this happen?

01:20:00.438 --> 01:20:03.419
It was rumored
a couple days ago.

01:20:03.441 --> 01:20:05.114
What will you say?

01:20:07.611 --> 01:20:08.954
I don't know.

01:20:11.582 --> 01:20:13.584
I really don't know anything.

01:20:18.322 --> 01:20:19.494
Why?

01:20:23.494 --> 01:20:24.734
Because...

01:20:29.333 --> 01:20:31.006
Because what?

01:20:37.775 --> 01:20:38.981
Maybe it's what you always say.

01:20:39.009 --> 01:20:42.183
Maybe I just don't
want to get to the top.

01:20:43.848 --> 01:20:45.350
Is that all?

01:20:54.125 --> 01:20:55.968
I can't explain.

01:21:34.365 --> 01:21:35.673
It's all right. I'll get it.

01:21:45.943 --> 01:21:47.149
It's nobody.

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.544
This has just come up for you.

01:22:15.072 --> 01:22:16.551
It's been passed by security.

01:22:16.574 --> 01:22:19.020
They've put it through
the machine. It's quite safe.

01:22:22.346 --> 01:22:24.348
Excuse me.

01:23:04.054 --> 01:23:05.897
I have to go out for a while.

01:23:07.758 --> 01:23:10.238
I'll be back as soon as I can.

01:24:46.423 --> 01:24:47.868
Beautiful wedding cakes.

01:24:47.891 --> 01:24:51.134
- Wedding cakes.
- You look at those.

01:24:51.161 --> 01:24:52.538
Now--

01:24:52.563 --> 01:24:54.543
You look at
the banqueting brochures...

01:24:54.565 --> 01:24:56.374
and I'll look at plum-duff.

01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:57.777
Cheers.

01:24:59.803 --> 01:25:02.943
Your mother should be
choosing the caterers.

01:25:02.973 --> 01:25:04.213
She's happy to leave it to us.

01:25:04.241 --> 01:25:06.414
And the church.

01:25:06.443 --> 01:25:07.751
She's had enough.

01:25:07.778 --> 01:25:09.758
She said she's tried them all.

01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:12.659
No one service is better
than any one else.

01:25:12.683 --> 01:25:14.685
I suppose she should know,
if anyone.

01:25:16.854 --> 01:25:18.993
But you know,
Stephen and I know St. Anselms.

01:25:19.022 --> 01:25:21.229
We do?

01:25:21.258 --> 01:25:22.737
The groom's father.
Good evening.

01:25:23.894 --> 01:25:26.135
We were just discussing
the wedding.

01:25:26.163 --> 01:25:27.870
We're not having
a white wedding...

01:25:27.898 --> 01:25:30.572
as I've already
moved in with Anna.

01:25:30.601 --> 01:25:33.946
Come on. You said
we'd go through the guest list.

01:25:33.971 --> 01:25:36.781
I will as long as I can
weed it out.

01:25:36.807 --> 01:25:37.979
Of course.

01:25:39.343 --> 01:25:41.323
It's actually quite fun.

01:26:00.764 --> 01:26:02.869
Do you think
I would have married Martyn...

01:26:04.134 --> 01:26:05.841
if I couldn't be with you?

01:26:10.174 --> 01:26:11.676
I'm coming.

01:26:34.898 --> 01:26:36.070
Hi, Jenny.

01:26:42.606 --> 01:26:45.177
We've done everything we can.

01:26:45.209 --> 01:26:46.586
As soon as possible.

01:26:46.610 --> 01:26:48.681
Couldn't be too soon for us.

01:26:48.712 --> 01:26:50.692
Everything
will be fine tomorrow.

01:26:50.714 --> 01:26:51.886
How's Rachel?

01:27:09.867 --> 01:27:11.869
It's Martyn.
Can I speak to Anna?

01:27:11.902 --> 01:27:13.779
I'm afraid she's left.

01:33:21.938 --> 01:33:23.781
Excuse me, please.

01:33:25.775 --> 01:33:26.947
Come on.

01:33:56.973 --> 01:33:59.146
Miss Barton
was to marry your son?

01:34:01.411 --> 01:34:03.584
You were here in the flat?

01:34:07.317 --> 01:34:09.797
Your son didn't know--

01:34:09.819 --> 01:34:12.425
He didn't know
of your relationship?

01:34:17.527 --> 01:34:18.733
You sure?

01:34:20.063 --> 01:34:21.235
You were careful?

01:34:24.134 --> 01:34:25.442
We were careful.

01:34:28.738 --> 01:34:30.581
Where did Miss Barton go?

01:34:33.910 --> 01:34:35.082
Sir?

01:34:37.714 --> 01:34:39.216
Do you know why she left?

01:35:04.874 --> 01:35:08.219
Do you have any comment
to make at this time?

01:35:08.244 --> 01:35:12.386
Have you got a statement
for us, please, sir?

01:35:12.415 --> 01:35:13.758
Come on.

01:35:22.325 --> 01:35:24.430
Stay right behind the line
of the gate, please.

01:35:28.765 --> 01:35:30.608
There are people living here.

01:35:36.106 --> 01:35:37.608
How are you feeling now?

01:35:38.608 --> 01:35:41.282
What does your wife think, sir?

01:35:58.361 --> 01:35:59.567
What have you done?

01:36:01.664 --> 01:36:03.473
The pain was unbearable.

01:36:05.068 --> 01:36:06.741
I was beating myself.

01:36:10.907 --> 01:36:12.716
The owner of the flat
called at the mews...

01:36:12.742 --> 01:36:16.519
to give Anna instructions
on how to work the boiler.

01:36:18.982 --> 01:36:21.588
It just happened
that Martyn was there.

01:36:25.255 --> 01:36:27.201
He'd never heard of the flat.

01:36:29.426 --> 01:36:30.928
Never heard of it.

01:36:33.463 --> 01:36:35.568
He took the address.

01:36:35.598 --> 01:36:37.305
It was chance.

01:36:41.504 --> 01:36:43.450
Why didn't you kill yourself?

01:36:45.708 --> 01:36:47.847
You should have killed yourself
when it began.

01:36:50.713 --> 01:36:52.124
Didn't you know?

01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:59.700
You thought you could go on?

01:37:03.593 --> 01:37:06.836
Every day into the future?

01:37:06.863 --> 01:37:09.537
Go on betraying us both
every day?

01:37:12.102 --> 01:37:14.207
You are not an evil man.

01:37:16.139 --> 01:37:19.018
You should have killed yourself
when you first realized...

01:37:19.042 --> 01:37:21.682
and then I would have
been able to mourn.

01:37:23.213 --> 01:37:27.059
It would have been hard,
but I would have buried you.

01:37:27.083 --> 01:37:29.063
And I would have wept.

01:37:52.475 --> 01:37:54.113
Take these.

01:37:54.144 --> 01:37:55.282
I don't...

01:37:55.311 --> 01:37:56.813
Come on.

01:37:56.846 --> 01:37:59.326
...want pills.
I want him back!

01:37:59.349 --> 01:38:01.329
I want my son back!

01:38:01.351 --> 01:38:04.992
I want Martyn!

01:38:05.021 --> 01:38:08.696
Give me my son!

01:38:11.694 --> 01:38:15.164
Martyn is dead.
Your son is dead.

01:38:15.198 --> 01:38:18.202
Give his death to me.
Give it to me.

01:38:22.539 --> 01:38:24.712
Give me his death.

01:38:28.578 --> 01:38:30.421
Give it to me.

01:39:04.914 --> 01:39:06.791
It's true, isn't it?

01:39:23.299 --> 01:39:25.301
What a pity we ever met.

01:40:08.611 --> 01:40:12.024
I think for everyone
there's just one person.

01:40:13.182 --> 01:40:14.684
For me...

01:40:16.019 --> 01:40:17.692
it was Martyn.

01:40:19.689 --> 01:40:21.862
For you, Anna.

01:40:23.192 --> 01:40:24.603
Poor Anna.

01:40:27.196 --> 01:40:28.368
Who?

01:40:33.469 --> 01:40:36.040
Were you ever in love with me...

01:40:39.475 --> 01:40:41.011
and this?

01:40:44.847 --> 01:40:46.417
Not enough?

01:40:46.449 --> 01:40:48.656
Not enough for you?

01:40:55.325 --> 01:40:58.033
For a moment there,
I thought of making love to you.

01:41:12.608 --> 01:41:15.748
Time. Grand healer, time.

01:41:15.778 --> 01:41:18.384
Time, not a day and a night.

01:41:35.698 --> 01:41:37.405
Come through, gentlemen.

01:41:56.719 --> 01:42:01.361
Gentlemen, in order to protect
my family and my colleagues...

01:42:01.391 --> 01:42:04.463
lam this morning
tendering my resignation.

01:42:21.878 --> 01:42:23.824
Come in.

01:42:33.489 --> 01:42:36.095
I tried to warn you.
I did try to warn you.

01:42:37.193 --> 01:42:38.695
I know.

01:42:47.770 --> 01:42:49.010
Do you know where she's gone?

01:42:52.642 --> 01:42:53.848
Where?

01:42:55.978 --> 01:42:57.218
She came here last night.

01:42:57.246 --> 01:42:59.283
She wanted to stay with me.

01:43:06.756 --> 01:43:07.928
Did she...

01:43:12.795 --> 01:43:14.433
I wonder,
did she leave a message?

01:43:30.046 --> 01:43:32.083
I do need to know
where she's gone.

01:43:32.114 --> 01:43:33.525
I think you know.

01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:36.860
You must remember.

01:43:36.886 --> 01:43:39.526
She told you the stow
of what happened last time.

01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:42.428
She'll go back to Peter.

01:43:44.727 --> 01:43:46.798
You must know that.

01:43:54.570 --> 01:43:55.742
I must go.

01:43:56.806 --> 01:43:58.308
I am sorry.

01:43:58.341 --> 01:44:00.480
Good-bye.
We shan't meet again.

01:44:00.510 --> 01:44:01.853
Thank you.

01:44:09.719 --> 01:44:11.198
She's here, isn't she?

01:44:14.690 --> 01:44:15.862
She's here.

01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:04.847
It takes a remarkably short time
to withdraw from the world.

01:45:06.342 --> 01:45:08.481
I traveled...

01:45:08.511 --> 01:45:12.015
until I arrived
at a life of my own.

01:45:16.252 --> 01:45:19.665
What really makes us
is beyond grasping.

01:45:19.689 --> 01:45:23.330
It's way beyond knowing.

01:45:23.359 --> 01:45:24.633
We give in to love...

01:45:24.660 --> 01:45:28.335
because it gives us some sense
of what is unknowable.

01:45:29.932 --> 01:45:34.005
Nothing else matters,
not at the end.

01:47:24.146 --> 01:47:26.956
I saw her once more only.

01:47:26.982 --> 01:47:32.864
I saw her by accident
at an airport, changing planes.

01:47:38.060 --> 01:47:39.562
She didn't see me.

01:47:41.397 --> 01:47:43.001
She was with Peter.

01:47:44.033 --> 01:47:45.910
She was holding a child.

01:47:48.137 --> 01:47:50.674
She was no different
from anyone else.
