00:17.400 --> 00:18.520
Ms…

00:19.840 --> 00:21.600
Ms. Monika. Congratulations.

00:21.680 --> 00:22.560
Over there.

00:23.920 --> 00:27.760
Once again, on behalf
of the entire teaching staff and myself…

00:27.840 --> 00:28.840
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

00:28.920 --> 00:30.360
…I congratulate you all.

00:30.440 --> 00:31.360
Excuse me.

00:37.560 --> 00:38.960
Go.

00:39.880 --> 00:40.920
Sorry.

00:43.040 --> 00:45.400
Told you to get a bigger bouquet.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.600
Ms. Zofia…

00:46.680 --> 00:48.640
A flower meadow
wouldn't be enough for you.

00:51.960 --> 00:53.040
There she is!

00:53.120 --> 00:53.960
Majeczka!

00:54.600 --> 00:55.520
Majka.

00:56.120 --> 00:57.440
Mr. Miłosz.

00:59.080 --> 01:02.000
- Here. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:04.360 --> 01:05.960
Ms. Maja.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.080
Maja!

01:07.680 --> 01:09.160
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

01:09.240 --> 01:12.440
Ms. Maja graduated top of her class!

01:13.160 --> 01:14.960
Yes! My daughter!

01:19.640 --> 01:20.800
That's my girl!

01:22.480 --> 01:24.400
It's the beginning of a new chapter, love.

01:24.480 --> 01:27.320
Exactly. I've been wanting to tell you--

01:27.400 --> 01:29.280
I know. You're most important to me too.

01:29.360 --> 01:33.000
It's incredibly obvious.
No need to say anything.

01:33.080 --> 01:34.360
- I love you.
- Okay.

01:34.440 --> 01:39.440
- Right. I wasn't talking about that.
- Majka, you nerd.

01:51.480 --> 01:52.720
Damn it.

01:55.240 --> 01:56.320
Thank you.

01:57.800 --> 01:58.640
Thank you.

02:06.400 --> 02:09.880
I will pay back you again.

02:10.800 --> 02:11.640
That's okay.

02:13.560 --> 02:14.880
Miłosz Rugwiro.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.520
Mirosław Roszkowski.

02:17.360 --> 02:22.280
My apologies, you took me by surprise.
Your Polish is very good.

02:22.360 --> 02:23.200
Thank you.

02:23.800 --> 02:24.640
So is yours.

02:27.560 --> 02:30.160
I want to get married.
I'm telling Dad today.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.760
What's the hurry?

02:33.280 --> 02:34.960
Can't you wait a little?

02:36.120 --> 02:37.400
A year? Maybe two.

02:37.960 --> 02:40.120
Your dad will get to know your fiancé.

02:40.200 --> 02:42.400
He might even like him.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.040
Are you for real?

02:45.120 --> 02:47.760
All of my exes still stutter
because of him.

02:47.840 --> 02:48.680
Exactly.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.360
Don't put the man you love through this.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.600
Dad, we need to talk.

02:59.680 --> 03:00.520
Maja.

03:01.320 --> 03:04.320
- I'm getting married.
- Over my dead body. Let's go.

03:05.720 --> 03:06.720
Told you.

03:10.160 --> 03:13.840
DEATH BEFORE THE WEDDING

03:13.920 --> 03:15.920
LITTLE DELIGHT DAIRY

03:18.360 --> 03:19.520
Jeez!

03:19.600 --> 03:20.680
What happened?

03:22.720 --> 03:25.320
What's this? Started your weekend
on Thursday, did you?

03:25.400 --> 03:27.160
Why are you making so much noise?

03:27.240 --> 03:29.960
You also celebrated
Manager Szyszko's birthday last night.

03:30.040 --> 03:33.920
But I left at a decent time.
What time did you wrap up?

03:34.000 --> 03:36.800
After the last round.
It would've been bad manners not to.

03:36.880 --> 03:38.880
How many last rounds were there?

03:38.960 --> 03:40.800
I stopped counting after the sixth.

03:40.880 --> 03:42.720
Jeez, I'm such a doofus.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.080
A doofus and a boozehound.

03:45.160 --> 03:46.960
You know what? It's embarrassing.

03:47.040 --> 03:49.600
You wouldn't survive
three days without me.

03:49.680 --> 03:50.520
Disgrace.

03:51.720 --> 03:53.440
In less than a month,

03:53.520 --> 03:55.640
we shut down 27 small,

03:56.240 --> 03:58.120
unprofitable dairies.

03:58.200 --> 04:01.320
In their place,
we'll open three large dairy plants,

04:01.400 --> 04:05.280
producing up to one million liters
of milk per day.

04:05.360 --> 04:06.240
Well done!

04:16.960 --> 04:20.000
After my annual leave, of course.

04:22.640 --> 04:23.520
DAIRIES IN POLAND

04:23.600 --> 04:25.800
What's going on? Can anyone fix this?

04:25.880 --> 04:27.280
There's one more dairy.

04:27.880 --> 04:28.920
What? Where?

04:29.000 --> 04:31.160
The smallest one. That's why we missed it.

04:31.240 --> 04:34.000
LITTLE DELIGHT DAIRY
WORKING - TO BE SHUT DOWN

04:35.760 --> 04:36.880
This is absurd.

04:36.960 --> 04:39.200
You should have people for everything.

04:40.080 --> 04:43.880
If you want something done right,
you have to do it yourself.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.920
Unless you're the CEO.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.240
- I am the CEO.
- So you can do whatever you want.

04:49.160 --> 04:50.800
It's on our way anyway.

04:50.880 --> 04:53.840
I'll quickly shut it down.
We'll be on the boat before dusk.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.800
- Yacht.
- We'll be on the yacht.

04:55.880 --> 04:58.360
- Show me what you've got.
- No, you show me.

05:01.240 --> 05:02.960
Little Delight Dairy. How can I help?

05:03.040 --> 05:05.520
This is CEO Rylski.
I'd like to speak to the manager.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.080
Hello! Please speak louder.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.320
This is CE-- Hey, watch out!

05:11.280 --> 05:12.520
Are you threatening me?

05:14.360 --> 05:15.360
Hello?

05:19.960 --> 05:20.800
Is Szyszko in?

05:21.600 --> 05:24.160
- I haven't seen him since yesterday.
- Weird.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.640
He's always around.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.880
I called him in the morning.
He didn't answer.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.480
- Right.
- Mirek.

05:31.560 --> 05:33.760
- Yes?
- Anything else?

05:33.840 --> 05:34.800
What?

05:35.480 --> 05:36.520
- Nothing.
- Right.

05:37.680 --> 05:40.000
- Come here, juicehead.
- I'm coming. Good afternoon.

05:41.120 --> 05:41.960
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY

05:42.040 --> 05:42.880
Not quite.

05:48.080 --> 05:50.080
Congratulations, Mom,

05:50.160 --> 05:53.080
on your pearl wedding anniversary.

05:53.160 --> 05:55.400
You deserve a medal
for putting up with Dad

05:55.480 --> 05:57.360
<i>for 30 years.</i>

05:58.520 --> 05:59.920
It wasn't that hard.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.600
Your father's not that bad.

06:02.120 --> 06:03.160
He just…

06:04.240 --> 06:05.160
Forgot?

06:05.880 --> 06:06.720
Again?

06:06.800 --> 06:08.720
This dairy is his whole world.

06:10.720 --> 06:13.320
Mom, you should be his whole world.

06:14.120 --> 06:14.960
One second.

06:16.160 --> 06:17.160
Little Delight. Hello?

06:17.240 --> 06:19.840
Hello, could you put
someone competent on the phone?

06:19.920 --> 06:20.760
You again?

06:20.840 --> 06:22.240
<i>Can you put someone competent</i>

06:22.320 --> 06:23.280
on the phone?

06:23.360 --> 06:24.440
Stop right there.

06:24.520 --> 06:27.800
Learn some manners first
and then call people.

06:28.560 --> 06:31.280
I'm not saying anything,
but if you want to know,

06:31.360 --> 06:33.680
I think they're blowing you off, Mr. CEO.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.280
Oh my.

06:39.520 --> 06:40.640
I've got to go.

06:40.720 --> 06:44.120
Some obnoxious man keeps calling me. Bye.

06:45.760 --> 06:46.720
Little Delight.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.840
This is CEO Rylski speaking.

06:49.920 --> 06:50.840
CEO?

06:51.880 --> 06:54.200
The receptionist is on maternity leave.

06:54.280 --> 06:58.440
This is accounting, sir.
I sincerely apologize.

06:58.520 --> 07:01.600
You'll have a chance to do it in person.
I'm on my way.

07:01.680 --> 07:04.840
But why come here? And why in person?

07:08.680 --> 07:09.520
Karol!

07:09.600 --> 07:11.800
- Boss?
- Have you seen Manager Szyszko?

07:12.320 --> 07:13.600
I did, yesterday.

07:14.400 --> 07:16.840
He said he'd lock up,
but it was open this morning.

07:16.920 --> 07:18.240
I'll call him again.

07:23.280 --> 07:24.120
Go.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.040
Why me?

07:25.560 --> 07:27.040
Someone has to, and that's you.

07:27.120 --> 07:28.920
- I'd rather not.
- Because?

07:29.000 --> 07:32.680
Because today
I'm scared of milk and heights.

07:32.760 --> 07:36.280
- Fine! I'll sort it out.
- Thank you very much.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.600
Shame on you!
A woman has bigger balls than you.

07:38.680 --> 07:41.680
- If the Devil can't go, he sends a woman.
- That's right. Well done!

07:45.880 --> 07:46.920
People!

07:47.520 --> 07:48.440
We have a problem.

07:48.520 --> 07:52.160
- We do. A big one, Renia!
- The CEO is on his way over.

07:52.240 --> 07:53.320
Where's Szyszko?

08:03.120 --> 08:04.400
Off I go then.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.080
Go. But don't forget who you are.

08:08.160 --> 08:09.520
I am the CEO.

08:09.600 --> 08:10.600
Who?

08:14.680 --> 08:15.600
The CEO.

08:15.680 --> 08:18.560
Remember, not a word about you-know-who.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.640
<i>Confidentiality is my middle name.</i>

08:21.760 --> 08:22.880
Good afternoon.

08:27.200 --> 08:28.520
Mr. President,

08:28.600 --> 08:30.080
on behalf of myself and--

08:30.160 --> 08:33.360
Right. Let's skip the formalities.
Where's the manager?

08:34.560 --> 08:35.480
He's gone.

08:36.360 --> 08:38.720
- I mean, he's out.
- When will he be back?

08:39.240 --> 08:40.520
- Mr. President.
- Yes?

08:40.600 --> 08:43.440
One day, we'll all face the Last Judgment.

08:44.280 --> 08:45.120
What?

08:45.720 --> 08:47.760
- Good afternoon.
- Afternoon.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.040
Where's the manager?

08:49.120 --> 08:53.120
- Mirosław Roszkowski, foreman. Pleasure.
- Likewise. Where's Szyszko?

08:54.160 --> 08:55.000
He's gone.

08:55.080 --> 08:55.960
Gone where?

08:56.480 --> 08:58.400
- To the cabin?
- Where the grass is greener.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.400
Senior Constable Tomasz Gawron.
Where's the deceased?

09:02.000 --> 09:02.920
And confidentiality?

09:03.800 --> 09:05.600
You have a corpse in a closet?

09:05.680 --> 09:06.840
In the cold room.

09:08.240 --> 09:11.880
Okay, Renia. Don't cry.
Go back to the office. Just go.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.480
- He was my age.
- Go.

09:17.360 --> 09:18.680
COLD ROOM

09:26.400 --> 09:28.280
You're screwed.

09:29.960 --> 09:31.960
Dang, this is cool.

09:35.240 --> 09:36.680
Come on, I'm recording.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.640
- Move.
- Ouch!

09:38.720 --> 09:40.200
No way!

09:40.280 --> 09:42.240
Wow! We'll get a gazillion likes.

09:51.280 --> 09:52.200
Good afternoon.

09:54.040 --> 09:55.600
I eat when I'm stressed.

09:56.400 --> 09:57.240
Good afternoon.

09:58.040 --> 09:59.760
- Take a seat.
- Thank you.

10:08.920 --> 10:10.600
This bread looks good.

10:10.680 --> 10:13.360
It's delicious. From our local bakery.

10:13.440 --> 10:16.600
Crispy crust, no flavor enhancers.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.440
And our cheese.

10:24.520 --> 10:25.960
Just a tiny bit.

10:28.520 --> 10:29.720
As a courtesy.

10:34.280 --> 10:35.360
Oh my God!

10:36.240 --> 10:38.480
I haven't had bread for three years.

10:39.080 --> 10:40.120
As a punishment?

10:40.200 --> 10:41.080
Not quite.

10:41.160 --> 10:42.000
A diet.

10:42.520 --> 10:45.240
I can now go for a whole week
just smelling a stock cube.

10:45.320 --> 10:46.320
Oh dear…

10:50.640 --> 10:51.520
Monika.

10:52.040 --> 10:53.200
Ika.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.960
Regina. Nice to meet you.

10:57.600 --> 10:59.520
Although the circumstances
could be better.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.200
Our manager has kicked the bucket.

11:04.200 --> 11:07.040
- My husband forgot about our anniversary.
- Oh my!

11:07.560 --> 11:09.520
And my daughter wants to get married.

11:11.480 --> 11:13.520
That's something to celebrate, right?

11:14.520 --> 11:16.040
Or a recipe for disaster.

11:16.120 --> 11:17.920
But a beautiful one.

11:23.360 --> 11:25.520
You can't just leave. We need to talk.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.640
- There's nothing to talk about.
- Says you!

11:27.720 --> 11:30.560
The dairy must be shut down.
It's unprofitable.

11:30.640 --> 11:33.480
- The equipment is ancient.
- Due to your underinvestment.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.760
Have you seen the black smoke
from the chimney?

11:35.840 --> 11:37.240
What about carbon footprint?

11:37.320 --> 11:38.840
What about women's wrath?

11:38.920 --> 11:41.280
Please, you don't even have a manager.

11:41.360 --> 11:42.400
Temporarily.

11:42.480 --> 11:45.520
We have many savvy ladies here
who get on with things.

11:45.600 --> 11:48.320
- Maybe one of them?
- Right. Let's be serious.

11:48.400 --> 11:49.400
I am willing…

11:50.440 --> 11:51.520
to take on this role.

11:51.600 --> 11:54.080
- Why you?
- Because I'm a man. That's why.

11:54.160 --> 11:59.280
- Whoever. I'm not going back to Silesia.
- Don't be dramatic. It's just business.

11:59.360 --> 12:02.360
- This business is our life.
- That's the price of progress.

12:02.440 --> 12:04.960
Somehow cows didn't make any progress.

12:05.040 --> 12:07.560
For hundreds of years,
they've been saying "moo,"

12:08.080 --> 12:10.160
eating grass, using four stomachs,

12:10.240 --> 12:12.240
giving milk, and making cow pies.

12:12.320 --> 12:16.400
Only you, city folks, think
that they give soy or rice milk.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.680
Or oat milk.

12:22.320 --> 12:25.000
- So, what's it gonna be?
- We're tearing it down.

12:25.080 --> 12:27.000
Darling! Remember our wedding?

12:27.080 --> 12:30.040
Excuse me, darling.
There won't be any tearing down.

12:30.120 --> 12:32.240
Whatever will be, will be.
The die's been cast.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.840
Yes. There'll be a wedding.
Majka is getting married.

12:34.920 --> 12:36.800
Our daughter's name is also Majka.

12:36.880 --> 12:38.600
She's talking about our daughter.

12:38.680 --> 12:40.560
Our daughter? Married?

12:41.560 --> 12:45.400
- No. I am not giving my consent.
- Neither am I.

12:46.080 --> 12:48.000
And there'll be no tearing down.

12:48.520 --> 12:49.920
Are you the CEO or not?

12:50.000 --> 12:52.760
If the wife wants a wedding,
there'll be a wedding!

12:52.840 --> 12:55.640
I love planning weddings,
but he doesn't get it.

12:55.720 --> 12:56.560
Right.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.440
So beautiful.

13:02.280 --> 13:03.440
Keep growing.

13:07.480 --> 13:08.600
Occupied.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.120
Mr. Roszkowski.

13:12.920 --> 13:16.200
Here's the deal.
You don't want me to shut down the dairy.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.880
I want my wife to sleep with me.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.000
I don't pry into people's beds.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.640
Relax. We can both benefit from this.

13:24.160 --> 13:26.360
- You'll marry your daughter--
- Over my dead body.

13:26.440 --> 13:29.320
And my wife will plan this wedding.

13:32.040 --> 13:34.360
Mr. President, please don't touch that.

13:34.440 --> 13:38.360
And let me remind you
that we're not your private farm.

13:38.440 --> 13:40.920
You fired us and shut the factory down.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.240
For three weeks.

13:43.920 --> 13:47.280
After the wedding,
you'll present me your restructuring plan

13:48.240 --> 13:49.760
and a candidate for the manager.

13:51.480 --> 13:53.960
Remember, no wedding, no dairy!

14:01.880 --> 14:03.680
<i>This is Maja. Leave a message.</i>

14:03.760 --> 14:04.800
Hello, dear.

14:05.960 --> 14:07.400
I've thought it through.

14:08.160 --> 14:09.560
If you want to get married,

14:10.080 --> 14:11.400
we'll get you married.

14:12.760 --> 14:13.600
Bye.

14:16.360 --> 14:17.200
What?

14:17.800 --> 14:20.480
You'd starve to death
within three days without me.

14:20.560 --> 14:21.640
All of you!

14:25.040 --> 14:30.200
…our brother, father, manager,
and we give Szyszko's body to the earth…

14:33.800 --> 14:34.680
Regina!

14:37.160 --> 14:39.040
"Comes unexpectedly"

14:39.120 --> 14:40.760
or "creeping up

14:41.360 --> 14:43.600
at night like a thief through a window"?

14:43.680 --> 14:44.920
"Unexpectedly."

14:45.000 --> 14:47.160
Right. "Unexpectedly."

14:47.240 --> 14:49.760
I made it simple, not Windsor.

14:49.840 --> 14:50.920
- Okay.
- Sit down!

14:51.640 --> 14:53.160
Coming. There.

14:54.360 --> 14:56.440
Have you got a candidate
for the manager yet?

14:56.960 --> 14:57.800
What?

14:58.880 --> 15:02.080
Well, do you think a woman
could be the manager?

15:02.160 --> 15:06.360
Have you lost your mind, Regina?
Women bossing us around? Come on!

15:07.640 --> 15:08.600
- Wait.
- What?

15:08.680 --> 15:10.560
- Are you trying to tell me something?
- Me?

15:10.640 --> 15:11.840
- Yeah.
- No.

15:13.080 --> 15:16.600
Are you trying to tell me
that I'm not manager material?

15:16.680 --> 15:19.960
Not at all, Mirek.
Who would be better than you?

15:20.040 --> 15:21.320
Come on.

15:21.400 --> 15:24.920
I'd never go against you.
How could you even think that?

15:25.000 --> 15:26.600
I didn't think that.

15:26.680 --> 15:27.560
Women…

15:28.120 --> 15:30.800
Leave men stuff to men.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.680
Jeez! What on earth?!

15:32.760 --> 15:34.200
- Sorry.
- Are you nuts?

15:34.280 --> 15:37.000
- Let me.
- Men have run this dairy for 50 years.

15:37.080 --> 15:39.280
And we love tradition as a nation.

15:39.360 --> 15:40.200
Of course.

15:40.280 --> 15:43.680
I just have to come up with a genius plan.
I need to unblock. I know I can.

15:44.200 --> 15:45.720
Half-Windsor will be better.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.720
Better yet, a Gordian knot! Just leave it.

15:47.800 --> 15:50.240
- Mirek.
- I have to come up with something.

15:50.320 --> 15:51.520
You will.

15:52.240 --> 15:53.080
Let's go.

16:03.080 --> 16:05.760
The life of our brother, Andrzej Szyszko…

16:05.840 --> 16:09.840
Uncle, I could sniff around
and find some dirt on the CEO.

16:09.920 --> 16:11.480
…ended prematurely.

16:11.560 --> 16:13.640
And blackmail him with old tickets?

16:16.840 --> 16:18.000
He lived like he wanted.

16:18.840 --> 16:22.200
- And he left on his own terms because…
- No.

16:23.040 --> 16:24.120
As he should.

16:24.200 --> 16:27.160
Embarrassing fetishes
and other indecent dirt.

16:29.080 --> 16:32.560
Now Mirek will say a few words
about the deceased.

16:32.640 --> 16:34.960
We're not those kinds of people.
If we win, we win.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.000
Fair and square.

16:46.960 --> 16:47.960
Shit.

16:52.000 --> 16:52.920
Listen.

16:56.600 --> 16:59.880
We all knew Andrzej.
We know what he was like.

16:59.960 --> 17:01.120
We liked him.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.160
He was a decent man and…

17:04.240 --> 17:06.520
Okay. Who am I kidding?

17:06.600 --> 17:07.960
He was a joker.

17:08.520 --> 17:10.600
Sometimes he was mean.

17:11.440 --> 17:12.280
Right?

17:13.120 --> 17:14.840
As ancient Poles used to say,

17:15.360 --> 17:16.480
"He liked his booze."

17:16.560 --> 17:17.400
Right?

17:17.480 --> 17:20.280
But he loved our dairy factory
like no one else.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.880
And I promise you, Andrzej,

17:23.720 --> 17:26.080
that I'll do-- I mean, we'll do anything

17:26.680 --> 17:29.600
to keep the dairy going, so help us God.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.120
Szyszko was my age.

17:36.640 --> 17:37.480
Aspergillum.

17:40.480 --> 17:41.880
<i>What's your plan?</i>

17:43.200 --> 17:47.600
We have to synchronize our tasks
because we don't have much time left.

17:48.480 --> 17:49.800
Friday is no good.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.560
Friday wedding brings
a lifetime of dreading.

17:52.640 --> 17:55.200
Mirek and I got married on a Friday.

17:57.080 --> 17:59.160
<i>There are exceptions.</i>

17:59.240 --> 18:00.920
Let's focus on this wedding.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.800
Does Maja like my vision?

18:02.880 --> 18:06.440
Does Maja like your vision?
Yes, very much. How's the yacht?

18:07.920 --> 18:08.760
Awesome.

18:08.840 --> 18:11.200
<i>Especially when one suffers</i>
<i>from seasickness.</i>

18:11.800 --> 18:13.040
Can I talk to her?

18:13.760 --> 18:14.600
Talk to whom?

18:14.680 --> 18:16.480
Well, to Maja.

18:16.560 --> 18:17.480
Maja?

18:17.560 --> 18:18.400
Maja.

18:19.800 --> 18:21.400
My daughter, Maja?

18:21.480 --> 18:22.480
<i>Regina.</i>

18:22.560 --> 18:24.560
Please put her on the phone.

18:25.720 --> 18:26.680
I can't.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.000
She went on her knees…

18:31.440 --> 18:32.320
Knees?

18:32.400 --> 18:33.840
She's mushroom foraging.

18:33.920 --> 18:35.400
<i>Mushrooms? In July?</i>

18:36.400 --> 18:39.200
Well, it's the early-delayed season.

18:41.800 --> 18:43.400
So please let me speak to

18:43.480 --> 18:44.760
the bride's father.

18:44.840 --> 18:46.320
The bride's father?

18:46.400 --> 18:47.400
Speak to him?

18:49.960 --> 18:51.880
He went somersaulting.

18:54.480 --> 18:55.320
He…

18:55.840 --> 18:57.760
He's jogging with her.

18:57.840 --> 19:00.120
I hope it doesn't give him a heart attack.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.840
Exactly. I also hope
it doesn't give him a heart attack.

19:03.960 --> 19:06.160
At least they've made up. That's lovely.

19:06.240 --> 19:08.360
Okay. Maximum two weeks.

19:08.440 --> 19:09.440
I've got to go.

19:09.960 --> 19:11.240
Thanks. Bye.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.600
Don't ever help me like that again.

19:17.160 --> 19:18.480
Mushrooms? In July?

19:19.880 --> 19:22.680
How's the wedding planning going?
Are you pleased?

19:23.640 --> 19:25.880
Very pleased. It's great.

19:27.520 --> 19:29.440
But, darling…

19:30.320 --> 19:33.880
could you play tennis with someone else?

19:34.560 --> 19:37.240
But no one is as good as you.

19:37.320 --> 19:40.440
I know, but I have so much work to do.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.760
I'll make it up to you.

19:45.480 --> 19:48.720
Your daughter is late
even on a day like this.

19:48.800 --> 19:52.600
- She's riding on a train, not driving it.
- Whatever. You raised her really well.

19:54.400 --> 19:56.240
Hey, you.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.640
- Is it the ginger guy?
- He's not ginger.

19:58.720 --> 20:00.840
- So you know who it is.
- No, I don't.

20:00.920 --> 20:02.360
All in.

20:02.440 --> 20:04.200
We'll have ginger grandchildren.

20:10.600 --> 20:12.000
Three.

20:13.560 --> 20:14.640
You won again.

20:14.720 --> 20:16.440
Because poker is a man's game.

20:18.640 --> 20:20.560
I could get over the ginger guy.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.320
It'd be worse
if it was one of her professors.

20:25.080 --> 20:26.520
So it is a professor?

20:27.120 --> 20:30.040
- And she was scared to introduce him?
- No.

20:30.760 --> 20:31.640
You ran off.

20:31.720 --> 20:33.560
We'll have a great son-in-law.

20:33.640 --> 20:36.280
Some broke-ass, twice-divorced loser.

20:37.160 --> 20:40.200
Why don't we pick them up
so they don't have to get a taxi?

20:40.280 --> 20:43.600
I arranged the ride of their dreams
for them. No worries.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.000
What did you have?

20:46.480 --> 20:47.560
A straight?

20:47.640 --> 20:49.200
- I did?
- Yes.

20:49.280 --> 20:50.480
I didn't realize.

20:54.840 --> 20:55.760
You won.

20:59.880 --> 21:00.800
They're coming.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.920
- Give it to me.
- I hope you didn't ask to handcuff him.

21:11.000 --> 21:12.120
It crossed my mind.

21:13.920 --> 21:15.000
My baby girl.

21:15.600 --> 21:18.400
POLICE

21:18.480 --> 21:19.800
Majunia.

21:20.520 --> 21:21.360
Hi!

21:21.440 --> 21:24.160
Reginka, not a word
about the dairy, got it?

21:24.240 --> 21:25.080
Not a word.

21:25.160 --> 21:26.640
Hello!

21:27.960 --> 21:28.800
What's…?

21:29.720 --> 21:31.720
Nothing better than crashing a party.

21:31.800 --> 21:34.400
- Why did they bring this friend?
- Hi.

21:34.920 --> 21:37.040
- Majeczka.
- Hi.

21:37.120 --> 21:38.800
- Hi.
- Where's the ginger?

21:43.840 --> 21:45.800
- Nice to see you again. Hello.
- Hello.

21:45.880 --> 21:47.080
- This is--
- I know.

21:47.160 --> 21:50.280
The friend I met
in the hallway at college.

21:50.360 --> 21:52.240
Yes. My fiancé, Miłosz.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.480
Let's not stand in the rain.

22:01.560 --> 22:04.080
Let's go inside, kids. Come on.

22:13.520 --> 22:14.600
Who did you bring?

22:15.520 --> 22:16.600
Who did you bring?

22:17.120 --> 22:18.000
Go!

22:22.200 --> 22:23.680
It could've been a professor.

22:26.680 --> 22:28.040
It's a beautiful photo.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.680
- From the Internet?
- From the forest.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.680
- I thought I'd make--
- A goat, but lions killed it.

22:43.240 --> 22:45.520
- How about some music?
- No music.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.720
- Maybe your birds?
- No birds.

22:55.680 --> 22:56.600
Thank you.

22:58.120 --> 23:01.920
I hope you like couscous.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.000
Obviously not potatoes, right?

23:05.120 --> 23:08.080
I love potatoes.
My grandmother had fields of them.

23:08.160 --> 23:09.280
In Africa?

23:10.720 --> 23:11.960
Near Świebodzin.

23:21.040 --> 23:21.920
Go on.

23:22.000 --> 23:24.720
What about the mealtime prayer?

23:25.920 --> 23:28.360
Since when do we pray before meals?

23:28.440 --> 23:29.440
Since forever.

23:29.520 --> 23:32.960
Because we are
a traditional Polish Catholic family.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.280
Would you stop that?

23:40.520 --> 23:43.320
It'll be fine
if we skip the prayer this once.

23:44.040 --> 23:46.160
- Fruit punch, anyone?
- I'd love some.

23:52.920 --> 23:55.000
You must be proud of your daughter.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.360
I guess you'll miss her when she's gone.

23:58.440 --> 24:01.360
My daughter is not going anywhere.
Definitely not to Africa.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.480
She's not vaccinated.

24:02.560 --> 24:05.080
- Vaccinated against what?
- Viruses.

24:05.880 --> 24:07.440
She doesn't need them in Holland.

24:07.520 --> 24:08.720
That's different.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.160
Holland?

24:10.680 --> 24:12.080
To Holland? What for?

24:13.200 --> 24:16.880
Maja will research mushrooms
that clean the world from plastic.

24:16.960 --> 24:18.000
Not anymore.

24:18.800 --> 24:20.600
I didn't take that job.

24:21.160 --> 24:23.640
What? You didn't?
That research was your dream.

24:24.440 --> 24:25.440
It still is.

24:25.520 --> 24:27.880
- But I don't have to do it in Holland.
- So where?

24:29.160 --> 24:30.200
Here.

24:30.720 --> 24:31.720
Here? In this hole?

24:32.320 --> 24:34.240
- Mirek.
- This is not a hole.

24:34.320 --> 24:35.680
Why didn't you tell me?

24:38.400 --> 24:41.880
We totally forgot. We got a gift for you.

24:41.960 --> 24:45.280
I mean, Miłosz has. It's from Miłosz.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.760
Is it in the suitcase? I'll get it.

25:04.200 --> 25:05.120
It's beautiful.

25:06.040 --> 25:09.720
Miłosz's father brought it with him
when he came to Poland to study.

25:10.760 --> 25:12.120
Can we talk?

25:12.760 --> 25:15.000
I almost forgot.

25:15.080 --> 25:17.280
Dad has a surprise for you too.

25:18.480 --> 25:19.600
What surprise?

25:36.760 --> 25:38.280
What's all this?

25:38.360 --> 25:41.080
Beautiful decorations for your wedding.

25:41.160 --> 25:43.480
This is beautiful. Not some black whatnot.

25:43.560 --> 25:46.640
Anyway, we have a detailed plan
for your wedding.

25:47.280 --> 25:49.320
In 14 days. There.

25:49.400 --> 25:50.800
Yes. It's all there.

25:54.520 --> 25:57.960
- It'll be beautiful.
- We're getting married in two weeks?

25:58.040 --> 26:00.880
That's right. Why wait?
You know what life's like.

26:00.960 --> 26:04.440
What if you get hit by a car?
Unless you've changed your mind.

26:04.520 --> 26:05.360
Chickening out?

26:05.440 --> 26:08.120
- No, but…
- We're not getting married in two weeks.

26:08.200 --> 26:09.920
Why not, baby girl?

26:10.000 --> 26:12.640
Don't tell me it's not
how you imagined it.

26:12.720 --> 26:15.720
I know, organizing a wedding
is not a piece of cake.

26:15.800 --> 26:16.840
But you have a father.

26:16.920 --> 26:21.000
A father without whom
you'd starve to death within three days.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.160
- It's the truth.
- Darling, stop it. Mirek.

26:24.240 --> 26:26.120
- Fine.
- There'll be a pergola of roses.

26:26.200 --> 26:29.120
Little cages, set up all over the place,
a carpet of flowers,

26:29.200 --> 26:32.480
a meter-and-a-half-long cream cake
from Aunt Danka.

26:32.560 --> 26:37.400
Yes! We'll release the flying lanterns
that go all the way to China, you feel me?

26:37.480 --> 26:42.240
Father Janusz gave you a pass
on an online premarital course.

26:42.320 --> 26:46.600
It's marked as passed online.
And no need to worry about confession.

26:46.680 --> 26:49.680
And you, my friend,
got a confirmation as a bonus.

26:49.760 --> 26:50.600
I was confirmed.

26:50.680 --> 26:54.360
You can trade it
for a burial in the sacred ground.

26:54.440 --> 26:55.280
Mirek.

26:55.920 --> 26:58.640
- What do you say? Yes?
- No!

27:02.040 --> 27:02.920
Majka, wait.

27:03.800 --> 27:06.080
- He's doing it on purpose.
- When did you decide?

27:06.600 --> 27:07.440
Did you hear him?

27:07.520 --> 27:10.720
- I'd starve to death within three days.
- When did you decide not to go?

27:11.240 --> 27:12.800
I don't know. A month ago?

27:13.400 --> 27:16.400
- A month?
- That's why he agreed to the wedding.

27:16.480 --> 27:18.560
Because he has to make
all decisions himself.

27:19.080 --> 27:20.040
Just like you, right?

27:21.760 --> 27:24.120
No. We can still discuss it.

27:24.200 --> 27:27.000
Discuss what?
The fact that I found a job in Holland?

27:27.880 --> 27:31.400
- You know you can find a job anywhere.
- Or that we're not getting married?

27:31.480 --> 27:34.080
We are getting married, but…

27:34.160 --> 27:35.000
But what?

27:35.680 --> 27:37.320
But not like that.

27:38.200 --> 27:39.800
Did you set up the guest room?

27:39.880 --> 27:41.800
- What?
- Did you set up the guest room?

27:41.880 --> 27:45.880
No living in sin as long as I'm here.
Separate bedrooms until the wedding.

27:45.960 --> 27:48.560
If there even is a wedding.
We shouldn't force them.

27:48.640 --> 27:51.280
Who's forcing them? Me?
She wanted to get married.

27:51.360 --> 27:53.520
- She did, but--
- So she wins.

27:54.640 --> 27:57.160
The nerves will fade away.
It'll all settle down.

27:57.240 --> 27:58.400
She's fine already.

27:59.720 --> 28:02.560
What's with that
"starve within three days without me"?

28:03.240 --> 28:06.520
It's the truth. You'd all starve to death
within three days without me.

28:12.240 --> 28:13.640
Okay. Thank you.

28:20.920 --> 28:22.520
Your father is trying his best.

28:23.880 --> 28:24.720
As always.

28:25.440 --> 28:27.240
And the outcome is the same as always.

28:27.320 --> 28:29.840
You might've given in to him, but I won't.

28:29.920 --> 28:32.840
- You've no idea how alike you two are.
- Not true.

28:32.920 --> 28:35.400
That's not true. We're totally different.

28:35.480 --> 28:36.880
Darling, please understand.

28:36.960 --> 28:40.160
Your father was hoping
that after graduation you'd go abroad

28:40.240 --> 28:42.560
and make an academic career.
What's wrong with that?

28:42.640 --> 28:45.400
Those are Dad's dreams. I have my own.

28:46.200 --> 28:48.280
I'm not making his dreams come true.

28:50.560 --> 28:54.120
Mom, I know that everyone goes abroad.
All of my friends are.

28:54.720 --> 28:57.280
But I really don't want
what everyone wants.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.120
I want to stay here.

29:05.680 --> 29:07.640
Take your suitcase off the bed.

29:07.720 --> 29:09.480
As soon as I unpack.

29:20.880 --> 29:23.840
We don't know
who his parents are and what they do.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.040
We don't know what he does.
We know nothing.

29:26.680 --> 29:28.640
- Just ask him.
- Right.

29:29.160 --> 29:31.160
He didn't let Majka go abroad.

29:31.240 --> 29:33.040
No, dear. It was her decision.

29:33.120 --> 29:35.960
Her decision? Please. It's a smokescreen.

29:36.040 --> 29:39.240
- He's conquering her. Step by step.
- Go to sleep.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.840
Listen to your thing.
I don't know, calm down.

29:41.920 --> 29:44.120
Regina, please. You don't get anything.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.800
This is the beginning.

29:45.880 --> 29:47.400
You know how they…

29:48.000 --> 29:48.880
Who?

29:49.720 --> 29:50.720
Well…

29:51.320 --> 29:53.560
Men. You know how they treat women?

29:54.200 --> 29:55.800
Yup, I know that all right.

29:56.480 --> 29:58.560
- Maja loves him.
- Loves him, right.

29:59.320 --> 30:00.200
She loves him.

30:02.760 --> 30:03.640
He has…

30:04.520 --> 30:05.600
bewitched her.

30:07.560 --> 30:08.480
I know.

30:09.400 --> 30:11.960
He bewitched her. He, you know…

30:12.040 --> 30:13.280
And I know what with.

30:13.360 --> 30:15.520
- Mirek.
- That's right.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.440
All right.

30:30.880 --> 30:32.320
Yes! Ha!

30:32.920 --> 30:37.320
Did you even consider in what language
you'll talk to your grandchildren?

30:41.080 --> 30:43.000
Regina, I'm disappointed in you.

30:43.600 --> 30:48.080
I'm disappointed in your daughter too.
You both stabbed me in the back.

30:50.440 --> 30:53.000
You should be happy
that there won't be any wedding then.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.080
Won't be? Take that back! There has to be.

30:55.160 --> 30:56.840
Why wouldn't there be?

30:57.400 --> 30:59.520
After the way you welcomed that boy?

31:01.480 --> 31:04.960
Mirek. It will be a miracle
if he doesn't run away during the night.

31:05.560 --> 31:06.760
Where are you going?

31:07.440 --> 31:08.880
I'm not sleeping with a racist.

31:08.960 --> 31:10.520
- I'm not a racist.
- You are.

31:10.600 --> 31:12.760
- Me? What are you on about?
- Yes, you are.

31:12.840 --> 31:14.880
And a gnome. And an old fart.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.120
Not old, all right? Not old.

31:17.800 --> 31:21.320
I am not a racist.
I'm friends with a Silesian.

32:02.440 --> 32:03.680
Where are you off to?

32:04.960 --> 32:08.040
- To the bathroom.
- It's in the basement. Right there.

32:08.560 --> 32:09.920
That one's for the ladies.

32:12.360 --> 32:13.200
Go on.

32:13.720 --> 32:15.520
Don't be shy. In the basement.

32:15.600 --> 32:18.680
I'll wait here,
in case you get lost on the way back.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.360
- Gimme.
- Take it back!

32:21.440 --> 32:22.320
What?

32:22.400 --> 32:24.640
No drinking at the command center.

32:27.360 --> 32:30.440
Gentlemen, I've gathered you here
because the fate of our families

32:30.520 --> 32:32.240
and our town is in our hands.

32:32.320 --> 32:35.120
Actually, in my hands.
But I need your help.

32:35.200 --> 32:38.200
No worries, you can count on us.
It's about the foreigner?

32:38.280 --> 32:40.440
Tomek told me. My condolences.

32:40.520 --> 32:41.640
Condolences on what?

32:42.520 --> 32:44.960
I thought he was ginger, but he's kind of…

32:45.040 --> 32:47.120
- Tanned.
- Burned to mahogany.

32:47.200 --> 32:49.880
Shut it, Gajda. Need I remind you
how you arrived here?

32:50.480 --> 32:52.320
You looked like a coal miner's son.

32:53.520 --> 32:54.680
Let's be clear about it.

32:55.200 --> 32:56.200
Miłosz is a Pole.

32:56.280 --> 32:57.920
Yeah, right. A Pole.

32:58.000 --> 33:00.520
And he cries when they play
the national anthem.

33:00.600 --> 33:02.520
Or when the white and red eagles score.

33:02.600 --> 33:04.600
We can get him the official kit.

33:04.680 --> 33:08.720
One with the hussar wings.
That'd be good. He'd learn some history.

33:08.800 --> 33:11.600
Did anyone ask
for your stupid, idiotic comments?

33:11.680 --> 33:13.920
- Yeah, you.
- No, I asked for your help.

33:16.680 --> 33:18.520
You're not buying him anything.

33:19.320 --> 33:21.920
Please, don't scare him off.
At least until the wedding.

33:22.000 --> 33:23.280
- Scare him off?
- Yeah.

33:23.360 --> 33:26.200
This isn't the boondocks.
We respect misfits here.

33:26.280 --> 33:27.320
We have Karolina.

33:28.680 --> 33:30.520
- And a rainbow flag.
- In a drawer.

33:30.600 --> 33:33.480
It didn't match the decor.
But I'm serious about Karolina.

33:33.560 --> 33:35.840
- Anyone ever said anything mean to her?
- Never.

33:36.880 --> 33:39.320
Maybe once. But not on purpose.

33:39.400 --> 33:40.360
Okay, gentlemen.

33:40.440 --> 33:43.040
From today, we're nice, helpful,

33:43.120 --> 33:44.600
and tolerant, okay?

33:44.680 --> 33:46.240
"Ha-ha" what?

33:47.280 --> 33:49.320
At least for two weeks.

33:50.600 --> 33:51.680
And you.

33:52.520 --> 33:54.280
Do some digging on Rylski.

33:54.840 --> 33:57.000
But how, Uncle? Now? Out of nowhere?

33:57.080 --> 33:58.280
Yes. You'll check--

33:58.880 --> 34:01.080
Check him. We need to have plan B.

34:04.080 --> 34:06.080
Is it true what they say about them?

34:08.080 --> 34:09.200
What?

34:09.960 --> 34:11.080
You know, that…

34:16.360 --> 34:18.360
That they pray to pagan masks?

34:20.600 --> 34:24.600
I'm really sorry we couldn't come.
Tell me about Maja's parents.

34:24.680 --> 34:26.520
- How did they welcome you?
- Very well.

34:26.600 --> 34:29.800
Good. What did they say
about the wedding here, in France?

34:29.880 --> 34:35.680
- They're delighted. It's just that--
- Wonderful. Tell me, what are they like?

34:37.160 --> 34:41.280
You know,
it's a traditional Polish family.

34:42.200 --> 34:43.600
Stop it. Give…

34:45.040 --> 34:47.680
You know that your tantrums are childish?

34:50.560 --> 34:52.360
- You're not going to work?
- No.

34:55.640 --> 34:57.520
Dad and I are taking some time off.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.600
Because of your visit.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.440
Seems like we needn't have bothered.

35:01.520 --> 35:05.760
Croissants are baked, everything is ready,
and your future husband is still sleeping.

35:06.520 --> 35:07.560
The birds won't wait.

35:07.640 --> 35:08.800
- Good morning.
- Morning.

35:08.880 --> 35:10.280
- What birds?
- Wild.

35:11.000 --> 35:13.520
Wild birds. How about going hunting?

35:13.600 --> 35:15.320
- Dad--
- I'd love to, but…

35:15.400 --> 35:17.800
- Right. We have plans.
- What about breakfast?

35:17.880 --> 35:21.240
Eat without us.
Today you're doing women's stuff.

35:21.320 --> 35:22.400
Garments and such.

35:22.480 --> 35:25.840
Or there's that book club.
Sign Maja up, bring her in.

35:26.360 --> 35:29.600
- But, Dad--
- Yeah, yeah. We're going hunting.

35:29.680 --> 35:33.280
We'll take spears and machetes,
and we'll wade through the savanna.

35:33.880 --> 35:37.800
We'll hunt something down
and bite out its heart.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.240
- Mirek.
- That's right.

35:39.320 --> 35:44.320
And then, with our mouths full of blood,
we'll sing chants to the goddess Kali.

35:44.400 --> 35:46.320
But first, let's make a man out of you

35:46.400 --> 35:50.120
because you look like a sad woman
in the rain, at the bus stop in Osiny.

35:57.280 --> 35:58.120
Goodbye.

35:59.280 --> 36:01.840
- Relax, it's not like he's going to war.
- Right.

36:02.880 --> 36:04.240
I can never tell with you.

36:05.960 --> 36:06.880
Clutch.

36:08.280 --> 36:09.280
Start the engine.

36:10.200 --> 36:11.120
Gas.

36:17.240 --> 36:20.280
Forward, Black Angel!

36:21.720 --> 36:23.400
This is going to end badly.

36:23.480 --> 36:25.440
It's not like he'll shoot him dead.

36:25.520 --> 36:26.880
Not before the wedding.

36:33.040 --> 36:37.080
I assume you don't have
much experience with women who are…

36:37.160 --> 36:40.400
- White?
- Don't put words in my mouth.

36:41.440 --> 36:42.680
Generally speaking.

36:42.760 --> 36:45.160
- I mean, I have some.
- Some?

36:45.240 --> 36:46.760
- I don't know. A few.
- A few?

36:46.840 --> 36:50.200
I knew it. Tell me quick,
how many wives have you had?

37:04.400 --> 37:06.520
- I've been in a few relationships--
- Shush!

37:07.920 --> 37:08.760
Okay.

37:09.920 --> 37:12.480
- Go on.
- It was nothing serious. Maja is special.

37:12.560 --> 37:14.880
And stubborn.
You'll convince her to get married.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.520
- Paper is not that important.
- It is to me.

37:20.440 --> 37:21.840
How much further?

37:21.920 --> 37:23.240
As far as necessary.

37:24.680 --> 37:28.640
You convince her to get married,
and I might convince myself to like you.

37:28.720 --> 37:29.880
Understood?

37:29.960 --> 37:30.800
Right.

37:30.880 --> 37:32.960
- Hush.
- I am hushing.

37:41.400 --> 37:43.160
Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!

37:44.680 --> 37:46.000
Are you insane, Father?

37:46.080 --> 37:46.920
Right.

37:50.400 --> 37:53.440
There will either be a wedding, or…

37:57.920 --> 37:58.960
The last rites?

38:00.000 --> 38:01.800
You never know when the Lord…

38:03.200 --> 38:04.960
will call upon you.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.040
Jesus Christ!

38:26.560 --> 38:27.400
What?

38:48.920 --> 38:51.880
- Will you tell me what we're doing here?
- Shortly.

38:52.560 --> 38:54.040
- Majeczka!
- Hi, Auntie.

38:54.120 --> 38:55.360
- Hi.
- Hi, Marzenka.

38:55.440 --> 38:56.280
Hi.

38:57.120 --> 38:59.120
I've heard the news.

39:00.680 --> 39:03.080
You've wasted away in the big world.

39:03.160 --> 39:06.320
No worries, we'll feed you up.
No place like home, right?

39:06.400 --> 39:07.680
I'm glad you called.

39:07.760 --> 39:11.000
- We can sign the contract right away.
- Put that away, child.

39:11.600 --> 39:14.280
Here, a word means more
than a piece of paper.

39:15.560 --> 39:17.760
The entire town is so grateful.

39:18.560 --> 39:19.520
Marzenka.

39:20.320 --> 39:22.160
Come in. Everything is ready.

39:22.240 --> 39:24.160
- What?
- What "what"? Go.

39:25.280 --> 39:27.760
And here's the dungeon. Watch out.

39:30.280 --> 39:31.800
Jesus Christ.

39:34.880 --> 39:36.880
Are you sure, dear?

39:37.560 --> 39:39.920
It's cold, dark, and very damp.

39:40.000 --> 39:41.960
Yup. It's perfect.

39:43.400 --> 39:45.920
I'll bring my fungi samples tomorrow.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.800
They should get along
with the ones you have here.

39:49.320 --> 39:51.880
We tried getting rid of them, to no avail.

39:51.960 --> 39:53.680
There were twice as many.

39:53.760 --> 39:55.040
Brave little fellas.

39:55.840 --> 39:59.080
Little? They had such big caps
and were growing everywhere.

39:59.160 --> 40:00.720
This used to be the archives room.

40:01.480 --> 40:04.480
Well, take it if you like it.
It's not being used.

40:07.760 --> 40:08.760
She doesn't know?

40:10.320 --> 40:11.920
Is there something I should know?

40:12.800 --> 40:14.880
No, nothing. Not at all.

40:15.440 --> 40:16.880
I was asking about your fiancé.

40:17.720 --> 40:19.520
How's it going? Dad likes him?

40:20.120 --> 40:22.200
Loves him like his own son,
from the start.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.840
- Is everyone off today?
- What?

40:30.480 --> 40:33.480
- No, it's the weekend.
- It's the middle of the week.

40:34.720 --> 40:36.680
Right, Gajda. It's the middle of the week.

40:36.760 --> 40:38.560
Your break is over. Go back to work.

40:38.640 --> 40:41.120
Let's go. Because of your tour
around the dungeon,

40:41.200 --> 40:42.520
we'll be late to Iza's stall.

40:42.600 --> 40:43.480
Come.

40:48.920 --> 40:49.760
Iza!

40:50.840 --> 40:55.040
Majka, I've heard you brought
quite a hottie with you. Congrats.

40:55.120 --> 40:58.200
And relax, I'm officially single
with no intentions of changing.

40:58.280 --> 41:01.200
Just like when you stole
my boyfriend before prom?

41:01.280 --> 41:02.120
Girls.

41:02.680 --> 41:05.400
Being single wasn't the thing back then.

41:05.920 --> 41:09.480
Come on, let's take a selfie
in my cheese showroom.

41:10.000 --> 41:13.040
- While it still exists.
- Why wouldn't it?

41:13.840 --> 41:16.720
What am I going to sell
when the CEO tears down the dairy?

41:16.800 --> 41:17.920
What do you mean?

41:18.960 --> 41:20.920
Right. We'll have some cottage cheese.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.240
She doesn't know?

41:22.320 --> 41:23.320
Doesn't know what?

41:23.400 --> 41:24.960
And some rennet cheese.

41:25.560 --> 41:29.600
You're about to lose your jobs,
and Dad is spending so much on my wedding?

41:29.680 --> 41:30.760
We'll manage.

41:30.840 --> 41:32.680
Unlike the rest of town.

41:33.320 --> 41:36.880
They can't shut it down just like that.
You have to fight. You have a manager.

41:36.960 --> 41:38.160
Not anymore.

41:38.240 --> 41:39.680
He took the Milky Way.

41:39.760 --> 41:42.720
Maybe it's time to get a new one.
Someone can still save it.

41:43.320 --> 41:47.040
We need a plan.
Small dairies are all the rage these days.

41:47.120 --> 41:50.200
- They must give you time.
- Your dad is already handling it.

41:50.280 --> 41:51.400
Someone else could.

41:52.200 --> 41:53.360
Who else?

41:53.880 --> 41:56.320
- Let's go. Karolina is waiting.
- I'm coming with you.

41:56.400 --> 41:57.400
What about your stall?

41:57.480 --> 41:59.960
Soon enough I'll be living in it.
Let's go.

42:04.320 --> 42:06.560
- Iza, are you in?
- Call.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.520
I call too.

42:12.280 --> 42:14.720
I really thought you actually read books.

42:15.240 --> 42:18.840
Eight, six, five,
with two hearts on the flop.

42:20.400 --> 42:21.240
Honey.

42:21.320 --> 42:23.600
We play poker at least once a week.

42:23.680 --> 42:24.840
Your mom taught us.

42:25.920 --> 42:27.280
I'm in with 5K.

42:28.040 --> 42:29.800
- I call.
- I fold.

42:30.760 --> 42:31.600
Call.

42:33.200 --> 42:35.440
- And the turn.
- Check.

42:35.520 --> 42:38.400
I knew she used to play in college
but stopped after marriage.

42:38.920 --> 42:39.760
Officially.

42:40.720 --> 42:43.160
Officially, she even lets your dad win.

42:44.600 --> 42:45.640
Call.

42:46.240 --> 42:47.840
- Fold.
- Cards.

42:53.600 --> 42:54.720
Ace and two pairs!

42:54.800 --> 42:56.400
- Bravo!
- Well played.

42:56.480 --> 42:58.080
- Lovely.
- Very well done.

42:58.160 --> 43:00.760
And the guys really don't know
that you play?

43:01.920 --> 43:05.040
They're all terrified
of women with bigger balls than theirs.

43:05.120 --> 43:08.280
Yeah. They all call me a spinster.

43:08.360 --> 43:13.080
Maybe I should grow a mustache
and start wearing Grandma's pantyhose?

43:13.160 --> 43:14.200
Here.

43:18.960 --> 43:20.520
Another time.

43:20.600 --> 43:21.960
Your loss.

43:22.040 --> 43:23.200
Locally grown.

43:23.880 --> 43:27.960
- Better than the menopause drugs.
- They treat, we prevent.

43:28.640 --> 43:31.080
We should take over the dairy.

43:34.560 --> 43:36.240
What? Hanka.

43:36.320 --> 43:39.480
Two children, runs the house,
her husband's an idiot, never complains.

43:39.560 --> 43:42.840
Karola can fix any machine.
She shines on the production line.

43:42.920 --> 43:45.520
Iza works the late shift
after closing her stall.

43:45.600 --> 43:47.640
I pack 300 cheeses per hour.

43:47.720 --> 43:50.520
Get that? Manually. With these nails.

43:51.120 --> 43:52.960
Yet we're still bossed around by men.

43:54.000 --> 43:55.200
We should change that.

43:56.800 --> 43:59.160
Right, only someone would have to

43:59.680 --> 44:00.960
lead us.

44:04.000 --> 44:06.240
She won't listen to us
but might listen to you.

44:26.120 --> 44:27.800
- Hello.
- Hello.

44:34.400 --> 44:35.840
I have a question for you.

44:36.440 --> 44:38.880
Did you work here
when the dairy was still open?

44:38.960 --> 44:40.320
On the production line.

44:41.040 --> 44:42.880
Before the scandal.

44:45.040 --> 44:46.400
CEO Rylski…

44:47.600 --> 44:49.600
wasn't always transparent in business.

44:50.200 --> 44:52.720
He wasn't because…
Tell me more about Rylski.

44:52.800 --> 44:53.640
About the CEO?

44:54.160 --> 44:55.880
I don't know anything.

45:00.600 --> 45:02.120
Apparently, the head office

45:02.200 --> 45:04.960
used fake milk tests.

45:05.040 --> 45:06.400
What fake tests?

45:06.480 --> 45:09.320
How am I supposed to know?
I was on the production line.

45:12.400 --> 45:15.280
Apparently, they're going to build a spa.
A developer came by.

45:15.360 --> 45:17.320
Here? In the middle of nowhere?

45:17.400 --> 45:18.240
Nowhere?

45:18.760 --> 45:20.880
There's a nature reserve right here.

45:21.520 --> 45:23.600
The big city folks will ruin it all.

45:25.720 --> 45:28.720
- Who was supposed to do these tests?
- How do I know?

45:29.320 --> 45:30.840
I worked on the production line.

45:30.920 --> 45:32.240
The girls are exaggerating.

45:32.320 --> 45:36.120
Dad may be a bit brusque,
but he has everything on his shoulders.

45:37.080 --> 45:39.960
And everyone will starve to death
within three days without him.

45:40.480 --> 45:43.000
Mom, the new manager could be a woman.

45:43.080 --> 45:44.120
I wonder who.

45:44.800 --> 45:45.680
How about you?

45:47.200 --> 45:48.280
Have you gone mad?

45:48.800 --> 45:52.160
- What kind of idea is that?
- A great one, in my opinion.

45:52.240 --> 45:54.640
No one would be
as good at this job as your dad.

45:54.720 --> 45:56.840
No one. All I can do is support him.

45:57.440 --> 45:59.440
Just like he supports you.

45:59.520 --> 46:01.440
Why did you even listen to them?

46:02.040 --> 46:03.680
- It's a very bad idea.
- Why?

46:04.320 --> 46:06.840
Why? Mom, you're perfect for this job.

46:06.920 --> 46:09.560
You're trustworthy,
hardworking, and honest.

46:10.680 --> 46:12.480
Painfully so. Let's go.

46:25.360 --> 46:26.200
Hello.

46:30.600 --> 46:31.440
Hello.

46:31.520 --> 46:33.920
Did you work in the old dairy factory?

46:34.520 --> 46:35.640
What?

46:36.680 --> 46:37.720
Can we talk?

46:41.000 --> 46:44.400
- We don't want any trouble.
- What trouble, gentlemen?

46:44.480 --> 46:46.080
Let's get a beer and have a break.

46:47.840 --> 46:49.360
Come, I have a cold one.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.760
Did you get the car and mower
as severance pay?

46:51.840 --> 46:53.480
Or for keeping your lips sealed?

46:56.240 --> 46:57.360
So my wedding

46:57.880 --> 46:59.680
is your bargaining chip?

46:59.760 --> 47:00.600
Is it?

47:02.240 --> 47:03.280
An ultimatum.

47:04.160 --> 47:06.760
It was the CEO's condition
to not close the dairy.

47:08.200 --> 47:09.720
Neither of us likes it.

47:12.200 --> 47:13.800
You don't have to do it.

47:16.200 --> 47:17.080
But I will.

47:17.760 --> 47:18.600
Maja.

47:18.680 --> 47:20.240
Okay. I'll get married.

47:20.760 --> 47:22.920
But on one condition.

47:23.480 --> 47:25.560
You'll apply to be the dairy manager.

47:26.160 --> 47:27.840
Absolutely not, dear child.

47:27.920 --> 47:30.280
I will never go against my husband.

47:30.360 --> 47:31.440
We're married.

47:31.960 --> 47:33.680
I hope you'll understand one day.

47:33.760 --> 47:35.200
I hope I never will.

47:36.240 --> 47:39.880
How will you explain to Miłosz
that you've made another decision for him?

47:45.880 --> 47:46.880
Miłosz?

47:54.560 --> 47:56.840
I texted you. The coast is clear.

47:59.960 --> 48:04.360
- Maybe we should wait.
- Nope. How did hunting go?

48:04.440 --> 48:05.280
Awesome.

48:05.880 --> 48:07.400
I came across as racist.

48:07.480 --> 48:08.840
Racist? You?

48:08.920 --> 48:11.640
I assumed that a white guy,
a priest, a forest, and a gun

48:11.720 --> 48:13.400
mean pogrom of the Black people.

48:14.880 --> 48:18.840
In the end, your father and I
have signed a nonaggression pact.

48:19.400 --> 48:20.880
What did you do to him?

48:21.640 --> 48:24.800
I blew ancestral ashes in his face.

48:25.400 --> 48:26.480
Did you hear that?

48:29.280 --> 48:30.120
Is he gone?

48:30.640 --> 48:31.520
He's gone.

48:34.120 --> 48:35.800
Since…

48:36.600 --> 48:38.720
you have signed this pact…

48:39.520 --> 48:41.320
why don't we get married here?

48:43.280 --> 48:46.560
- But you said--
- I've changed my mind.

48:47.640 --> 48:50.400
What's the difference
where and when we get married?

49:05.840 --> 49:08.640
Relax, Regina. It's just martens.

49:09.360 --> 49:10.960
Martens are romping around.

49:14.480 --> 49:15.880
We need to get a cat.

49:17.720 --> 49:18.760
Some kind.

49:27.680 --> 49:29.760
The wind is blowing in the chimney.

49:50.080 --> 49:52.920
- Regina, how much sugar do I take?
- Three. I put in three.

49:53.000 --> 49:57.040
Three unstirred. You stirred it.
I can't drink it or even taste it.

49:57.120 --> 49:59.960
Regina, please. How many years
have we been together?

50:00.040 --> 50:01.600
You know nothing about me.

50:04.920 --> 50:07.840
Why are you peeking over my shoulder?
I mean… why peeking?

50:08.800 --> 50:11.200
Girl, you won't get any of this anyway.

50:11.800 --> 50:12.720
Come on.

50:14.520 --> 50:15.840
Let's go?

50:17.360 --> 50:18.920
To the meeting at Karolina's.

50:19.840 --> 50:22.120
You've gone mad with this book club.

50:22.200 --> 50:25.200
We have to work on decorations.
Some of them won't work.

50:25.880 --> 50:26.760
What decorations?

50:27.440 --> 50:29.320
- The wedding decorations.
- Wedding?

50:30.120 --> 50:30.960
But…

50:31.560 --> 50:33.400
Wedding? Here?

50:34.000 --> 50:36.080
- We're getting married.
- Really?

50:37.920 --> 50:39.920
Rather than going to the book club,

50:40.000 --> 50:43.760
wouldn't you prefer to spend some time
with your future… husband?

50:43.840 --> 50:48.280
I'm sure that my future husband
would love to spend some time

50:48.360 --> 50:49.960
with his future father-in-law.

50:50.600 --> 50:51.560
Right, darling?

50:55.160 --> 50:56.160
Of course.

50:59.200 --> 51:00.760
Right. Let's go?

51:02.080 --> 51:03.720
Take Miłosz to the dairy.

51:06.480 --> 51:07.560
May I?

51:14.360 --> 51:17.280
Do they eat other people's sandwiches
back in Africa too?

51:28.600 --> 51:32.600
- Was it a good idea to bring him here?
- Calm down, he's on our side.

51:35.000 --> 51:37.280
No, not there. All good.

51:45.920 --> 51:46.760
Hey.

51:52.040 --> 51:53.640
This is the press.

51:54.480 --> 51:55.720
For cheese.

51:55.800 --> 51:58.680
We make cheese together

51:58.760 --> 52:02.640
and put to oval shape, you know.

52:04.200 --> 52:05.800
And this is the vats.

52:06.640 --> 52:10.000
Large vats for milk.

52:10.640 --> 52:12.520
This is the white water from cows.

52:13.760 --> 52:15.080
Nice to meet you, homie.

52:16.800 --> 52:18.280
Nice to meet you too.

52:19.960 --> 52:22.560
- How many liters do they hold?
- Three thousand.

52:24.480 --> 52:26.320
- He speaks fluent Polish.
- So do you.

52:27.520 --> 52:28.920
I wonder where he learned.

52:29.560 --> 52:31.000
A mail-in course.

52:31.080 --> 52:32.920
- Jeez…
- Great job, homie.

52:33.000 --> 52:35.360
Right, gentlemen. What's this all about?

52:35.880 --> 52:37.760
A break in production?

52:37.840 --> 52:41.080
No, it's not a break. It's…

52:41.960 --> 52:43.960
- Inventory.
- Of the warehouse.

52:44.040 --> 52:45.240
Inventory?

52:47.920 --> 52:50.320
Right. Can I look around?

52:50.400 --> 52:52.600
Don't break or touch anything.

52:52.680 --> 52:53.640
Sure.

52:55.440 --> 52:56.480
He seems friendly.

52:56.560 --> 52:59.000
What did you think?
That he'd barge in with a spear?

52:59.080 --> 52:59.920
Yeah.

53:01.080 --> 53:04.400
- Okay, does anyone have a plan?
- Maybe we could…

53:05.240 --> 53:06.120
You know…

53:06.880 --> 53:08.080
Do you have a plan?

53:08.160 --> 53:09.680
I have a suggestion.

53:10.200 --> 53:12.360
I could apply for an EU grant.

53:12.960 --> 53:15.560
- There are programs--
- My friend does that.

53:15.640 --> 53:17.200
You think like men.

53:17.280 --> 53:18.480
That's good, right?

53:18.560 --> 53:21.200
But we won't win
if we have identical plans.

53:21.280 --> 53:23.400
You know why they're shutting us down?

53:23.480 --> 53:24.880
Because no one knows about us.

53:24.960 --> 53:27.960
They can shut us down, demolish,
and bulldoze the rubble, and what?

53:28.040 --> 53:29.440
No one will know.

53:29.960 --> 53:32.760
The Internet is the power.
We must crawl out from under a rock

53:32.840 --> 53:34.360
and show ourselves to the world.

53:34.440 --> 53:35.520
What would we show?

53:35.600 --> 53:38.280
- Well…
- An outdated production line?

53:38.360 --> 53:40.360
An ancient furnace?

53:41.120 --> 53:41.960
Or, I don't know…

53:42.720 --> 53:45.520
a cold room with a thermostat
we have to watch 24/7?

53:48.960 --> 53:50.000
I've got an idea.

53:51.520 --> 53:53.960
And? This is the power!

53:58.920 --> 54:00.680
No way. You use coal?

54:00.760 --> 54:02.280
- What else?
- That's right!

54:02.360 --> 54:04.080
Poland was built on black gold.

54:04.160 --> 54:06.480
As if you know anything about production.

54:06.560 --> 54:10.160
- Actually, I do.
- Yeah, from mail-in courses.

54:10.240 --> 54:12.640
No. I have a degree
in Logistics and Production.

54:12.720 --> 54:16.480
- No, wait a minute.
- Exactly. Wait a minute, gentlemen.

54:17.800 --> 54:19.920
Nothing holds together here.

54:20.000 --> 54:22.120
- What?
- This is all makeshift.

54:22.200 --> 54:24.080
You need a new furnace.

54:24.160 --> 54:27.680
New furnace?
This one's 120 years old. It's wonderful!

54:27.760 --> 54:31.320
The problem is that it's 120 years old.
They don't make them anymore.

54:31.400 --> 54:34.160
You need a new production line and panels.

54:35.440 --> 54:37.760
What? Do you churn butter manually too?

54:39.080 --> 54:39.920
Okay.

54:40.480 --> 54:41.920
Can I see the cold room?

54:46.120 --> 54:49.280
You think he'll realize?
The corpse was in here for 15 minutes.

54:49.360 --> 54:51.800
- You wouldn't, but he might.
- Okay.

55:00.840 --> 55:02.280
It doesn't hold temperature.

55:02.880 --> 55:03.720
It does.

55:05.480 --> 55:07.720
You just have to monitor it.

55:07.800 --> 55:09.520
Gentlemen, you need a new system.

55:09.600 --> 55:12.840
- Let's focus on the furnace.
- The furnace alone won't solve anything.

55:15.560 --> 55:20.160
Listen, you could invest
in two, three maturing cabinets

55:20.240 --> 55:22.640
and completely renovate this place.

55:22.720 --> 55:27.320
I think that 300, 400K
would be enough to start.

55:29.840 --> 55:31.280
- Good one!
- A joke! He's good.

55:31.360 --> 55:33.080
Have you lost your mind?

55:41.520 --> 55:43.720
It needs work, but I think it will do.

55:44.400 --> 55:45.720
What about your fungi?

55:45.800 --> 55:49.400
One doesn't exclude the other.
Fungi and cheese go great together.

55:49.480 --> 55:52.240
Yup, this is a totally Instaworthy setup.

55:52.320 --> 55:54.800
Any ideas how to sell it to the public?

55:56.040 --> 55:57.080
Not yet.

55:58.000 --> 55:58.880
But I will.

56:00.080 --> 56:01.320
Okay, we can do this.

56:01.400 --> 56:03.920
We just have to roll up our sleeves.

56:04.000 --> 56:05.960
Before we start rolling our sleeves up,

56:06.040 --> 56:07.840
we have to take care of something else.

56:14.200 --> 56:15.280
Give me more.

56:15.360 --> 56:18.040
- I don't have anymore.
- You have some there.

56:22.360 --> 56:24.040
So we're in deep black shit.

56:26.240 --> 56:29.520
Nothing personal, homie.
It's just an old Polish saying.

56:30.320 --> 56:33.160
Listen, I know
a refrigeration equipment manufacturer.

56:33.240 --> 56:34.960
I could get a discount.

56:35.040 --> 56:36.080
Of 200%?

56:36.840 --> 56:40.160
Not that much,
but won't the head office contribute?

56:40.240 --> 56:41.080
Don't even…

56:42.080 --> 56:43.080
How about a loan?

56:44.680 --> 56:45.920
What are they doing here?

56:54.160 --> 56:56.000
Is this some sort of demonstration?

56:56.080 --> 56:58.400
Demonstration? No. A proposal.

56:58.480 --> 57:01.480
- Hanka, who's with the kids?
- Now you're interested in children?

57:02.000 --> 57:06.120
We want to save our factory
and offer our plan for change.

57:06.720 --> 57:09.120
Karola, you're insane.
Did you put them up to this?

57:09.200 --> 57:10.440
No.

57:10.520 --> 57:11.360
I did.

57:12.920 --> 57:13.760
You?

57:13.840 --> 57:15.600
My own daughter?

57:15.680 --> 57:18.000
Putting logs under my feet,
spokes in my wheels?

57:18.080 --> 57:20.880
And we have our candidate
for the dairy manager.

57:20.960 --> 57:22.840
A manageress, to be precise.

57:24.000 --> 57:25.400
A manage-what?

57:26.920 --> 57:28.240
Regina, what's going on?

57:29.840 --> 57:31.680
You have your proposal, right?

57:31.760 --> 57:33.160
Well, we have ours.

57:33.840 --> 57:36.360
And we have the right to put it forward.

57:36.440 --> 57:37.560
May the best one win.

57:38.920 --> 57:40.840
Who's your candidate?

57:43.320 --> 57:45.360
You'll find out in good time.

57:45.960 --> 57:47.560
So you're declaring a war on us.

57:48.280 --> 57:50.280
You want war? Then you'll have it.

57:50.360 --> 57:52.920
But for the time being, the dairy is ours.

58:02.120 --> 58:05.320
What is this supposed to be?
Your way to entice Miłosz?

58:09.280 --> 58:10.240
What?

58:10.320 --> 58:13.120
- We were supposed to be proactive.
- And?

58:13.200 --> 58:14.920
Black guys play basketball.

58:15.000 --> 58:17.560
Did you even ask him
if he plays basketball?

58:18.480 --> 58:19.520
What for?

58:20.040 --> 58:20.960
It's obvious.

58:27.080 --> 58:28.640
- Where? Come on!
- Pass!

58:28.720 --> 58:30.640
- Come on!
- Over here!

58:37.520 --> 58:38.720
Stop!

58:39.840 --> 58:40.680
Okay!

58:41.800 --> 58:43.120
Come back!

58:43.200 --> 58:44.680
Come on!

58:44.760 --> 58:46.320
- Pass!
- Go back.

58:46.840 --> 58:47.680
Okay!

58:48.400 --> 58:50.120
Okay, got it.

58:50.200 --> 58:51.160
Harder!

58:59.440 --> 59:00.440
That's right!

59:01.160 --> 59:02.120
Good one!

59:03.640 --> 59:04.640
What a goal!

59:09.920 --> 59:10.760
Thank you.

59:12.560 --> 59:13.400
Thank you.

59:28.800 --> 59:31.880
Are you mad?
Do you want me to have a heart attack?

59:31.960 --> 59:34.360
It would obviously be better
if I had one, right?

59:34.880 --> 59:35.800
Who is it?

59:36.760 --> 59:37.600
Stop it.

59:37.680 --> 59:39.960
Not Karolina or Hanka. Who?

59:40.640 --> 59:42.840
- Go to sleep.
- You'll embarrass us.

59:42.920 --> 59:45.440
I will have to fix everything myself.

59:45.520 --> 59:46.400
Within three days--

59:46.480 --> 59:48.840
- Yup, we'll starve to death without you.
- Exactly.

59:48.920 --> 59:51.960
Regina, answer my question. Who is it?

59:59.280 --> 01:00:01.880
You too, Brutus, against me.

01:00:05.080 --> 01:00:07.000
The world's gone upside down.

01:00:07.080 --> 01:00:08.960
My own wife…

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:17.880
Where are you going?

01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:20.480
I'm not used to sleeping with the enemy!

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:30.080
They live together, work together.
Can't they compromise?

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.000
They can't.

01:00:32.680 --> 01:00:34.360
You don't get it. You'd have to…

01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.400
I'd have to what?

01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:44.280
Maybe telling me Dad's plan
would change something.

01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:50.600
- Yeah, it would make me a snitch.
- No, not a snitch.

01:00:51.720 --> 01:00:53.240
It would make you…

01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.080
an adviser.

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:56.920
Come on.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:58.400
What are they up to?

01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:04.160
Majka, I only just got to a place
where your father doesn't want to kill me.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:06.800
And you want me to tell you
what they're up to?

01:01:07.760 --> 01:01:08.800
Absolutely not.

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:12.880
Maybe

01:01:13.480 --> 01:01:16.640
I could try to convince you?

01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:29.320
No? Fine.

01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.520
Our plan is better than yours anyway.

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:49.520
This is a sturdy piece of shit.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.160
Don't! If it snaps, we're screwed.

01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.480
I'm serious.

01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.640
I got a few cabinet options
from my friend.

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.160
Thanks, but no, thanks.

01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:11.640
- Let's look at them together. I can help.
- I'll do it myself later.

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.120
Is it so difficult to accept help?

01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.800
No, the difficulty is

01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:20.440
that I hate overbearing
and deceitfully nice people.

01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:23.960
- I get it. It's so Polish, isn't it?
- What is?

01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:27.840
If you're a lout and a boor, you're cool.
You wave your fists around, you're a hero.

01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:30.360
But if you're nice and kind?

01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:33.880
You're either weak or an idiot, right?
And who wants to talk to an idiot?

01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:35.120
A Black one, at that?

01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:38.440
Okay, put this over there.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:56.960
Go on.

01:02:58.320 --> 01:02:59.680
- Here.
- Cheers.

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:08.840
- It's good.
- Father Janusz made it.

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:10.960
You know.

01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.920
Right. This is option one.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:23.720
We could get two of these.

01:03:24.680 --> 01:03:25.600
What else?

01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:29.440
This one is currently on sale.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.680
Not made of bamboo but good.

01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:08.160
<i>European greenfinch, Chloris chloris.</i>

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:40.880
Did you get my funeral suit
from the cleaners?

01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:43.320
Why? Is there another funeral?

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:45.960
Of your plan.

01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:52.480
Let's go, Bambo!

01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:06.760
I could possibly file an application
but not without your wife's consent.

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.880
Boguś.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:10.080
Who held you in his arms at baptism?

01:05:11.080 --> 01:05:12.720
- This is a felony--
- Boguś.

01:05:12.800 --> 01:05:16.800
Where did your grandfather
and father work? Where?

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:23.400
This dairy fed you, get that?
And paid for your college, Boguś.

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:28.600
- My boss would replace me with an ATM.
- You're already an ATM. Chill.

01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.440
What?

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:37.200
Why are you waving that finger?
We both know it's a fake camera.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:44.360
The application cannot be accepted
without your wife's signature.

01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:52.200
- I'll be back in a minute.
- Sure.

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:40.160
- You didn't get it from me.
- Why is it not in the database?

01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:42.360
The case was dropped. He got away with it.

01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.520
Or he paid well.

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:48.080
- It came from the top. Nothing you can do.
- We'll see.

01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:51.760
Hello, chicas! I'm talking to you.

01:06:52.280 --> 01:06:54.240
I know how to promote our dairy.

01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:56.520
On my account!

01:06:56.600 --> 01:06:59.720
I have two million views
and half a million followers.

01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.920
Fans of "check out my new claws."

01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.040
I thought we were on the same team.

01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.640
Okay then, girls.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.360
I can have my nails done, within reason.

01:07:08.440 --> 01:07:10.640
You will but not nails.

01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:16.400
MAGICAL MAŁE DOBRE

01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:18.320
- People actually watch this?
- It's good.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:22.000
They love it. Look.
They don't watch it. They love it.

01:07:22.080 --> 01:07:23.280
The Stasiaks' horse.

01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:28.000
And they'll definitely love girls
who take over a factory run by men.

01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.720
So what are you saying?
We'll be running around the woods?

01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:34.880
We'll do something totally different.
Something women haven't done before.

01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.000
A race like this.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.680
Check this out.

01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:43.480
- What?
- These guys are crazy.

01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:48.440
- No, we can't do that.
- Of course we can.

01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:51.080
Put this away. Serve us.

01:07:51.160 --> 01:07:52.880
No. Not today, gentlemen.

01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:55.600
Not today? You need some hair of the dog.

01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.800
- That's right!
- Yup.

01:07:56.880 --> 01:07:58.160
Are you a man?

01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:01.160
Or a wimp? Go on.

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.800
Cheers. Come on.

01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.480
And? Feeling worse?

01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:14.880
I know what it's like.
I was also an alien here once.

01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:17.240
I don't think so.

01:08:17.320 --> 01:08:21.440
I had to go through my share of crap.
Start talking like them.

01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.760
That's right, man.

01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:25.480
So I don't talk like them?

01:08:26.360 --> 01:08:29.160
You do. You just have to blend in more.

01:08:32.280 --> 01:08:34.080
Blend in? That's a good one.

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:37.440
A Silesian can learn
to talk without the accent.

01:08:37.520 --> 01:08:39.520
If you're fat, you can always lose weight.

01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:44.320
Someone ginger can put a hat on.
What should I do? Whitewash to blend in?

01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.280
I have no intention of hiding.

01:08:49.360 --> 01:08:51.360
Wait, don't hide. That's good.

01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:54.040
That's how you win them over.
They'll appreciate it.

01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:57.120
They're the best people in the world.
Rough but sensitive.

01:08:58.400 --> 01:08:59.880
But they're scared of strangers.

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:04.680
I don't think my future father-in-law
is scared of anything.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.200
He's scared the most.

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:11.560
They don't have it easy here. Never had.
That's why they're like this. Cheers.

01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:14.160
Right.

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:15.960
Best to get smashed, right?

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.480
We have a furnace and cabinets to buy.

01:09:18.560 --> 01:09:20.240
- Pour me one.
- What about the money?

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:21.800
What about the money? Cheers.

01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:23.280
Where did you get it?

01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:26.080
Out of my ass.
From the forest, my grandpa's treasure.

01:09:26.160 --> 01:09:28.560
I dug up a pot of gold.

01:09:28.640 --> 01:09:29.480
What?

01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:33.080
Sorry.

01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:34.400
Okay. Thank you.

01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:40.160
Well, life, right?

01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:42.200
Sit.

01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.280
Right. Thank you.

01:09:44.840 --> 01:09:46.840
Gentlemen, it's sorted.

01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:49.800
We have 21 days to pay the invoice.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:52.080
- Well done!
- Pour me more!

01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:54.600
- That's my boy!
- May they last long!

01:09:54.680 --> 01:09:56.440
- Yeah!
- Guys, Uncle, we've got it!

01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.960
- Got what?
- I did it! Rylski is going to jail!

01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:01.360
That asshole in crocodile shoes
is going down.

01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:08.880
<i>For a hundred years, a hundred years</i>
<i>May he be locked in a cell</i>

01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:12.960
<i>For a hundred years, a hundred years</i>
<i>May he be locked in a cell</i>

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:18.280
<i>And some more, and some more</i>
<i>May he be locked in a cell…</i>

01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:21.000
In total, they shut down
ten dairies in one year.

01:10:21.080 --> 01:10:23.800
They're turning two into housing estates
and one into a spa.

01:10:23.880 --> 01:10:26.880
- They'll demolish us too.
- A spa? Here?

01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:29.960
- They sold three as farmland.
- They had the right. It's their land.

01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:32.680
True. But they didn't have the right
to do something else.

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.480
Apparently they were adulterating milk.

01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:36.560
What?

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:38.160
Watering it down.

01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:41.160
It would show. They have to run tests.

01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:44.040
They do.
Five hundred kilometers from Warsaw.

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.800
I got my hands on some of those tests.

01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:50.640
But I don't get any of it.

01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:54.040
Okay, yeah.

01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.040
Not my thing.
I know about logistics and production.

01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:02.800
Didn't you have any lab classes?

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:03.960
I didn't.

01:11:05.680 --> 01:11:06.560
But…

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:08.320
I know who did.

01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:10.920
Who?

01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:14.760
Milk tests?

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:16.840
Most likely watered down.

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:18.760
On a large scale.

01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.560
No, not large.

01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:27.520
Gigantic.

01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.040
High five!

01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.480
All right. Thank you very much, ladies.

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:35.880
Goodbye, see you later. Ta-da!

01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:37.720
The manager will be ours.

01:11:37.800 --> 01:11:39.720
It doesn't say who ordered it.

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:44.320
Anyone could've just printed it
off the Internet.

01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:48.360
But they're not from the Internet.

01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:52.080
They're from a reliable informant.

01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:56.280
We hope that your reliable informant

01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:58.480
confirms who the ordering party was.

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.840
Right. I guess that's all.

01:12:05.920 --> 01:12:07.200
Thank you.

01:12:09.720 --> 01:12:10.880
Good luck.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.760
It won't be a manager.
It will be a manageress.

01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:15.720
That's right.

01:12:19.520 --> 01:12:21.400
- Maja, come on!
- Coming!

01:12:24.800 --> 01:12:25.640
Hello?

01:12:25.720 --> 01:12:27.560
<i>Hello. Is this Mrs. Regina Roszkowska?</i>

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:29.920
Yes, it is. Sorry, I can't talk right now.

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:34.080
<i>I'm calling to offer you a unique product,</i>
<i>designed especially for you. I guarantee--</i>

01:12:34.160 --> 01:12:36.160
No, really. I'm not interested.

01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:39.200
I've got everything.
Quilts, pillows, pots, insurance…

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:42.560
I don't need any health checks
or anything else you want to offer me.

01:12:42.640 --> 01:12:44.040
<i>Mrs. Regina, let's be serious.</i>

01:12:44.120 --> 01:12:46.480
<i>I'm calling from your bank</i>
<i>to offer you a credit card</i>

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:48.440
<i>designed specifically for your mortgage.</i>

01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:50.000
But I don't have a mortgage.

01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:51.440
<i>Of course you do.</i>

01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:54.480
<i>It's only just been signed,</i>
<i>but we work with the speed of light,</i>

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:57.200
<i>and we care about spouses</i>
<i>who sign spousal agreements.</i>

01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:59.200
<i>- How about additional--</i>
- No, thank you.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:01.280
<i>Hello? Mrs. Regina?</i>

01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.000
I'm ready. Everything okay?

01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:13.240
Mom, I know
that this is a surprise for you both.

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:15.240
If you can't make it, then…

01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:18.040
<i>No, we'll definitely try to make it.</i>

01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:22.520
<i>Dad will try too. Right, dear?</i>

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.560
Dad has to make an urgent phone call.

01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:34.120
We're happy as long as you're happy.

01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:35.080
I am.

01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:37.080
Very happy.

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:40.720
<i>It's like he's found a second father.</i>

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:48.680
<i>So you want me</i>
<i>to send you some warm clothes?</i>

01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:50.680
It seems that it's cold over there.

01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:54.200
No, it's just a temporary cold snap.

01:13:57.680 --> 01:13:59.560
Where's your fiancée?

01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:03.960
<i>And the mother-in-law?</i>
<i>It's high time we met, isn't it?</i>

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.000
<i>High time.</i>

01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:32.840
Look, our girls.

01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.600
Yeah, I think so.

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:56.160
Wow, not a bad roll for your age.

01:14:56.240 --> 01:14:59.200
See? Surprised, right?
What do you think they're doing?

01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:01.320
Exercising.
Doing something for themselves.

01:15:01.400 --> 01:15:04.200
Nonsense. Regina has never done
anything for herself.

01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:07.160
- Maybe she didn't like doing things alone.
- Alone? She's got me.

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:09.000
She's always had me.

01:15:09.080 --> 01:15:11.640
She's smiling.
I haven't seen her doing that before.

01:15:13.240 --> 01:15:14.880
She's not smiling.

01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:18.800
It's a grimace of exertion
because of these stupid exercises.

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:24.120
Is that a greenfinch or goldfinch?

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.440
Greenfinch.

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.680
- It's as beautiful as the Holy Grail.
- Yeah, it is.

01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:38.120
- Where've you been? You're late.
- You brought kids?

01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:40.440
I had to. Hanka's busy
plotting with the others.

01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:42.000
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.760
Okay, come on! Let's go.

01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:45.560
Let this eagle land, please.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.640
- That's right!
- There it is!

01:15:49.160 --> 01:15:51.160
- No!
- Got it!

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:53.120
It's here! Damn, it's here!

01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:56.000
We've got it! Come, child! Give it a hug.

01:15:56.080 --> 01:16:00.040
- Come and see. We'll make lovely cheese.
- You don't have one like this at home.

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:01.480
Good one!

01:16:03.160 --> 01:16:04.840
I don't know. Find a different one?

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:07.720
No, this one's good.
I know it. It must be this one.

01:16:11.960 --> 01:16:13.600
Right. We've got the hill.

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.280
What about cheese?

01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:19.320
- The guys are occupying the dairy.
- There's no time to make it anyway.

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:22.280
We don't have the time,
but we do have the cheese.

01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.000
- We do?
- Hi, darlings!

01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.760
- Hi!
- Hello!

01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:30.680
Hey! Welcome to the first ever
ladies' cheese rolling race!

01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:34.040
In England, men have been competing
in this race for hundreds of years.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:39.000
But today, we have decided
to challenge the man's world!

01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:40.520
Why are we doing it?

01:16:40.600 --> 01:16:43.840
To show everyone
that no one will defeat us.

01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:48.960
Because we're rebels
and we'll do anything for our cheese!

01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.040
Like, share, send to your friends!

01:16:51.120 --> 01:16:53.960
And now, a few words
from our mistress of ceremonies!

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:57.840
Here she is. The future boss
of the best dairy factory in the world!

01:16:57.920 --> 01:17:00.040
What are the rules, boss?

01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.840
Well, the cheese is heavy.

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:07.320
And it rolls very fast.

01:17:07.400 --> 01:17:12.280
Listen! Whoever gets to the cheese
and lifts it up first, wins!

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:14.880
Gentlemen, we are challenging you!

01:17:14.960 --> 01:17:16.080
Cheese!

01:17:17.920 --> 01:17:21.560
Three, two, one, go!

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:02.480
Nice, right?

01:18:05.080 --> 01:18:06.000
It's a monster.

01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:07.880
Two monsters.

01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:12.400
Gentlemen, this is it.

01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:13.320
Right.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.440
- Don't touch it.
- What? The light's not on.

01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:27.440
I can see that!

01:18:31.440 --> 01:18:34.880
It's not working.
Your friend sold us junk!

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.600
- Maybe the fuses blew out?
- Shmooses blew out.

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:43.840
For this much money,
it was supposed to send us up, not down.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.400
Told you not to trust him.

01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:47.040
- Shut up.
- He's not from here.

01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:48.560
- Shut it.
- From where, then?

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.720
Who's bothering me now?

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:52.280
You think I'm from Africa?

01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:55.440
I'm warning you. Call me homie again,
and you're done, homie.

01:18:55.520 --> 01:18:57.400
Hello? If you want to--

01:18:58.320 --> 01:18:59.480
All of them? How?

01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:03.840
Any views? Is it a hit?

01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:06.760
Twelve views.

01:19:07.320 --> 01:19:11.520
I've watched it, like, ten times.
The other two must be the girls.

01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.160
Hanka!

01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:24.000
- Hanka!
- Where are the children?

01:19:24.520 --> 01:19:27.920
Now you're interested in children?
Are you okay?

01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:30.280
What happened?

01:19:30.360 --> 01:19:33.280
Nothing. Just a few scratches after…

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:35.280
Yeah? Where's Regina?

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:36.960
They're tending to her now.

01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.000
Have you all gone mad?

01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:42.600
Are you trying to commit mass suicide?

01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:45.240
To hurt yourselves? Whose idea was it?

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.800
So all of you came up with it.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:51.200
You think you can fool a sly fox like me?
Spill it. Which one?

01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:53.280
Which one wants to be your manager?

01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.760
- Which one?
- It's me.

01:19:55.320 --> 01:19:56.680
Regina! Jesus.

01:19:58.040 --> 01:19:59.120
What did you say?

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:02.480
I am their manager.

01:20:08.240 --> 01:20:09.200
No, not this.

01:20:13.200 --> 01:20:14.800
It's this one. Look, Bunny.

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:16.720
One, two, three.

01:20:19.480 --> 01:20:22.480
HOSPITAL EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:26.800
Trying to steal a managerial job
from your own husband?

01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:30.160
Steal? The girls and I wanted
to put forward a counterproposal.

01:20:30.240 --> 01:20:31.760
After all these years together.

01:20:34.800 --> 01:20:37.560
- We have democracy, you despot.
- Despot?

01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:42.880
You're the one plotting treachery
behind my back.

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.160
As if you didn't.

01:20:45.240 --> 01:20:46.320
Typical you.

01:20:46.400 --> 01:20:50.480
You see the speck in someone else's eye
but don't notice a plank in yours.

01:20:54.520 --> 01:20:55.520
What's up, Gajda?

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:58.640
Hello? I changed the phase.

01:20:58.720 --> 01:20:59.680
Changed it?

01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:01.040
Everything blew out.

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:02.120
Blew out? How?

01:21:02.200 --> 01:21:03.600
Jeez, I don't know how.

01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:06.520
That's it. We're doomed.

01:21:06.600 --> 01:21:07.520
Are you coming?

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:09.040
Jeez. Okay. I'm coming.

01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:24.720
You mortgaged our house for this?

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:28.080
- Did you know?
- The situation required a fast decision.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:30.920
Regina, let's not overreact.
If it wasn't for me, within th--

01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:32.160
Enough!

01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:35.280
Not a word about three days.

01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.240
We may lose the house because of you.

01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:40.560
- Your betrayal is worse!
- Because of me?

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:44.080
My betrayal is worse? Oh no, my dear.

01:21:44.160 --> 01:21:47.880
That's it. The end. Enough. <i>Finito.</i>

01:21:47.960 --> 01:21:50.280
I've gone along with this sham wedding

01:21:50.360 --> 01:21:52.440
just to save this town--

01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:54.280
I'm sorry, what sham?

01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:57.880
What sham?

01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:59.400
Disperse.

01:22:01.080 --> 01:22:02.280
Where are you going?

01:22:03.760 --> 01:22:06.200
To save what you haven't ruined yet.

01:22:15.320 --> 01:22:16.920
- More?
- That one. Take it.

01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.160
- And the last one.
- Give me that one.

01:22:40.760 --> 01:22:44.720
That will be ten points, Mr. Mierzejak.

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:49.160
- What are you doing here, ma'am?
- Am I being arrested, officer?

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:52.760
We'll skip the handcuffs this time.

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.520
How about a lift?

01:22:54.600 --> 01:22:55.560
This way.

01:22:56.680 --> 01:23:00.040
I came early to surprise the young couple.

01:23:00.120 --> 01:23:02.880
- Let me open the door.
- Thank you.

01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:17.160
Now we'll get the silent treatment.

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:27.040
Next, you'll terrorize me
by withholding sex.

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.080
Dad.

01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:33.120
You can forge my signature,
so you can handle this too.

01:23:33.200 --> 01:23:34.880
Can we go back to silence?

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:37.960
Why not? That's so you, isn't it?
Keeping a few things to yourself.

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.800
Majeczka had good intentions.

01:23:39.880 --> 01:23:43.440
You always have the best intentions.
The road to hell could be paved with them.

01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:47.600
Who the hell?

01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:50.960
It's got to be the debt collector.
Let him in.

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:53.600
He's here to take everything.
Every single thing.

01:23:54.200 --> 01:23:56.120
So funny. Hilarious.

01:23:56.200 --> 01:23:58.520
You're just like your mother. The same.

01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:00.960
I am nothing like Irena.

01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:31.400
She's already here. Shush.
Let's pretend we're not in.

01:24:34.560 --> 01:24:35.800
They're ignoring me?

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:38.760
Mrs. CEO?

01:24:43.240 --> 01:24:45.840
Are you gonna sit here smirking
or do something about it?

01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:47.680
Or is that against the law?

01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:50.360
Right.

01:24:56.920 --> 01:25:01.080
<i>Come out and don't resist,</i>
<i>or we'll have to use force.</i>

01:25:01.160 --> 01:25:04.600
Has he lost his mind?
Yelling through a megaphone?

01:25:04.680 --> 01:25:06.480
Go out there. Talk to him.

01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:12.880
Turn that off!
Have you completely lost your mind?

01:25:12.960 --> 01:25:14.440
What are you doing, Tomek?

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:15.800
When can I use it then?

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:17.120
Use it at home!

01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:24.400
So here I am, coming to you
straight from the Azure Coast

01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:27.160
of the Vistula riverbank
to finalize the wedding,

01:25:27.240 --> 01:25:28.720
and this is how you welcome me?

01:25:28.800 --> 01:25:32.120
We welcome you very warmly.
We were baking a cake and didn't hear.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.360
What happened?

01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:40.520
You can give up
and stop talking to each other,

01:25:40.600 --> 01:25:45.080
or get a grip and turn this defeat
into something beautiful.

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:47.600
- How?
- Rise like a phoenix.

01:25:49.840 --> 01:25:50.680
So?

01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:54.320
We're very sorry
that you came here for nothing.

01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.720
Such is our fate.

01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:58.480
No matter what you do,
crap catches up with you.

01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:01.800
Oh my! I've got something for you.

01:26:02.960 --> 01:26:04.240
I was going to wait…

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:08.000
until the wedding,
but the situation calls for it.

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:11.480
- No, I can't accept that.
- Yes, you can. You must, even.

01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:21.800
Little Delight?

01:26:23.920 --> 01:26:24.760
Look.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:30.640
My great-grandfather.

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:31.920
COOPERATIVE DAIRY IN MAŁE DOBRE

01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.120
Employed by Ksawery Rylski
shortly after he built

01:26:35.880 --> 01:26:38.920
a dairy factory in 1894.

01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:42.120
I found it at the office.
It must've been there since the takeover.

01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:44.160
And started the beginning of its end.

01:26:44.240 --> 01:26:45.320
That's the truth.

01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:47.960
My ancestors came and settled here.

01:26:48.040 --> 01:26:50.840
This is where they started families
and built houses.

01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:55.240
And they all worked
at the same dairy for generations.

01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:57.920
They tore down the old buildings
and built new ones.

01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:00.360
But their hearts were always here.

01:27:00.960 --> 01:27:01.960
Always.

01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:03.640
This is our place on Earth.

01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:05.760
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:09.000
The kids will get married,
you'll restore the dairy,

01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:10.640
and one day their children

01:27:10.720 --> 01:27:13.080
will give their kids
a photo like this one.

01:27:13.600 --> 01:27:14.800
So what's it gonna be?

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:21.720
- She looks beautiful.
- So beautiful.

01:27:22.320 --> 01:27:24.280
She has not aged a day.

01:27:29.080 --> 01:27:29.960
My God…

01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:38.040
Excuse me, Renia. Can we talk?

01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:42.160
Since when are you interested
in my opinion?

01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:44.400
- Since always.
- That's not true.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.880
That is not true.
I was just supposed to nod.

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:50.280
You know what I was?
I was one of those dogs

01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:54.640
that people buy for their cars.
With a head that goes up and down.

01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:55.880
- That's not true.
- It is.

01:27:56.880 --> 01:27:58.400
- And you know what else?
- No.

01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:01.840
I want you to apologize
for never appreciating me.

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:04.520
And for everything else.

01:28:06.280 --> 01:28:07.120
Okay.

01:28:07.640 --> 01:28:08.960
I'm sorry, Renia.

01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:09.960
Stop crying.

01:28:10.600 --> 01:28:11.600
And speak louder.

01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:16.840
I'm sorry.

01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:18.280
Okay.

01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:26.520
My beloved daughter.

01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:27.600
Congratulations.

01:28:30.920 --> 01:28:33.560
Thank you again
for scooping us up from the roadside.

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:36.160
What bad luck to get a flat tire.

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:39.520
Road assistance wouldn't come for hours,
and I'd be late for the wedding.

01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:40.960
Weddings are beautiful.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.200
As long as you're smart enough
to sign a prenup.

01:28:49.160 --> 01:28:50.640
How romantic.

01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:00.080
We have cold summers here, right?

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.360
Frozen.

01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:08.000
Maybe there's traffic.

01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:10.960
Is it harvest time?
There might be combines on the roads.

01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:12.200
It's not.

01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.360
He'll come. He wouldn't risk my wrath.

01:29:20.560 --> 01:29:22.880
- They're here.
- They're here.

01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:28.600
- Welcome!
- <i>Bonjour.</i>

01:29:28.680 --> 01:29:29.680
Apologies!

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:33.240
We had some minor issues on the way.

01:29:33.320 --> 01:29:35.720
You're lucky they were minor,
or you'd have major ones.

01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:36.760
Hello.

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:39.280
- Sorry.
- Welcome.

01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:43.320
- Hello.
- You're so much more beautiful in person.

01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:48.640
- Hello, nice to meet you.
- Boys, come help.

01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:52.040
- Right. We meet at last.
- Yes.

01:29:52.120 --> 01:29:55.280
- Mirosław Roszkowski.
- Pleasure to meet you. Hello.

01:29:56.240 --> 01:29:57.560
- Hello.
- Roszkowska.

01:29:57.640 --> 01:29:59.680
- Mirosław Roszkowski.
- Mirosław?

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:01.480
- Nice to meet you.
- <i>Enchanté.</i>

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:02.520
So?

01:30:03.040 --> 01:30:03.880
Come here.

01:30:04.440 --> 01:30:06.440
- A wedding!
- That's right. Come in.

01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:07.960
- Yes. Let's go.
- Come in.

01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:10.560
- Let me take your jacket.
- Mr. President.

01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:13.520
- What's up?
- Well, Mr. President.

01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:15.320
Your wife is content.

01:30:15.400 --> 01:30:19.600
The wedding's on, everyone's happy.
Our agreement still stands, right?

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.160
Yes, of course.

01:30:21.800 --> 01:30:23.720
We'll talk after the ceremony.

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:31.360
In a moment we will--

01:30:31.440 --> 01:30:32.600
I mean, you will

01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:35.720
embark on a new life path together.

01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:38.720
Sometimes it'll be straightforward,
sometimes it'll be bumpy.

01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:42.040
Sometimes it'll be a bed of roses,
sometimes…

01:30:42.720 --> 01:30:44.840
Sometimes it will be…

01:30:45.920 --> 01:30:46.920
that…

01:30:48.680 --> 01:30:50.440
you come across a cow pie.

01:30:53.040 --> 01:30:54.160
Sorry.

01:30:54.240 --> 01:30:55.160
What?

01:30:55.720 --> 01:30:57.080
Let's cut to the chase.

01:30:57.840 --> 01:31:01.120
In the presence of God
and the Catholic Church,

01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:04.120
repeat these vows after me.

01:31:06.480 --> 01:31:07.320
I, Maja…

01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:08.720
I, Maja…

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:10.480
…take thee, Miłosz…

01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:12.120
…take thee, Miłosz…

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:14.560
We have a recovery and business plan.

01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:17.480
- And we bought new equipment.
- Later.

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:19.680
You're not interested, are you?

01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:22.000
Look. This is just a small dairy.

01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:23.920
Come on.

01:31:25.320 --> 01:31:27.920
If anyone knows of any reason
why them two shouldn't--

01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:30.160
I mean, these two shouldn't

01:31:30.800 --> 01:31:35.280
be joined in holy matrimony,
speak now or forever hold your peace.

01:31:35.360 --> 01:31:37.120
I know of a reason.

01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.440
- Yes?
- Yes, I do.

01:31:38.520 --> 01:31:39.920
There'll be no wedding!

01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:43.040
- Mirek!
- Silence! There'll be no wedding!

01:31:43.120 --> 01:31:46.760
I mean, they may still get married,
but my daughter and my…

01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:49.280
- Son.
- Son!

01:31:49.360 --> 01:31:51.720
They won't be making
a spectacle of themselves

01:31:51.800 --> 01:31:55.320
for the benefit of this CEO,
who had already decided to sell our dairy,

01:31:55.400 --> 01:31:57.480
shut it down, and fire all of us!

01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:58.560
Is this true?

01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:02.120
Darling, I was stalling to make you happy.

01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:04.680
You wanted a wedding,
I gave you a wedding.

01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:07.960
I'm really sorry. I had no idea!

01:32:08.720 --> 01:32:11.480
No one will treat us like that.
My investigation uncovered--

01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:13.400
- Calm down. Sit.
- But, Uncle--

01:32:13.480 --> 01:32:17.480
Stop shouting. Sit down!
We're not stooping to the CEO's level.

01:32:17.560 --> 01:32:21.760
People! The spa is going ahead,
and all of you will make money on it!

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:24.560
- Sir, you'll sell our dairy to us.
- No way.

01:32:24.640 --> 01:32:26.240
No idea where we'll get the money…

01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:28.160
- I'll pay!
- And me.

01:32:28.240 --> 01:32:30.040
…but we'll buy it from you.

01:32:30.120 --> 01:32:31.080
Absolutely not.

01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:34.560
We've got plans regarding this land.
You've got to accept that.

01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:35.560
Listen.

01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:41.200
You will sell to these people
what they deserve at a bargain price…

01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:42.320
Darling--

01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:45.000
…or else, your invoices
will see the light of day.

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:49.840
No.

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:52.360
- You wouldn't.
- Yes, I would.

01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:54.560
Everyone will know
that you add water to milk.

01:32:54.640 --> 01:32:57.800
And start getting used to
sleeping on the couch.

01:33:03.160 --> 01:33:06.520
Fine. I'll sell the dairy to you.
But it won't be cheap.

01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:09.600
- It will.
- Darling, don't-- Fine.

01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:11.320
Hooray!

01:33:11.400 --> 01:33:12.280
All right!

01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:14.280
Within reason.

01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:16.600
Family meeting.

01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.000
Come, Bunny. Sit here.

01:33:23.880 --> 01:33:25.000
- Sit down.
- So?

01:33:25.600 --> 01:33:26.560
Second mortgage?

01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:30.360
- No one will hire me anywhere.
- You? No. But your wife?

01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:31.320
Everyone will.

01:33:32.200 --> 01:33:33.040
Even…

01:33:34.160 --> 01:33:36.520
if he sells it cheap, it won't be free.

01:33:37.120 --> 01:33:40.040
Maybe we should really all chip in.

01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:42.480
Yeah, that'd be good.
I don't have that much.

01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:46.200
- What happened to "I'll pay"?
- I will but not that much.

01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:48.920
We're all in the same boat.

01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.560
Yet it seems that some of us
are on the top deck

01:33:51.640 --> 01:33:53.640
and others are much lower below.

01:33:53.720 --> 01:33:57.840
- What do you mean?
- Stop it. We can't start arguing now.

01:33:57.920 --> 01:33:59.280
How about crowdfunding?

01:33:59.360 --> 01:34:02.360
Slow down with those ideas of yours.

01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:03.480
Stop it, Mirek.

01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:07.240
- Together we can work something out.
- Not this time, in my opinion.

01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:09.680
Unless someone from beyond
is looking after us,

01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:11.560
because only a miracle can save us.

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:18.840
It's Szyszko.

01:34:20.840 --> 01:34:22.080
It's done.

01:34:23.480 --> 01:34:24.440
It'll be okay.

01:34:26.080 --> 01:34:29.440
Mom, trust me,
they really are good people.

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:34.920
No one forced us to get married.
We wanted to because we love each other.

01:34:35.520 --> 01:34:39.240
I don't know what to think.
The wedding turns out to be… What?

01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:42.200
A dairy event?

01:34:42.280 --> 01:34:43.440
I can't keep up!

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:45.960
Stop humming.

01:34:53.360 --> 01:34:56.080
- My father is flabbergasted.
- I'm not surprised.

01:34:56.160 --> 01:34:59.000
Not because of the wedding.
Because of cheese.

01:34:59.840 --> 01:35:01.200
It tastes like heaven.

01:35:02.080 --> 01:35:03.320
Wonderful.

01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:12.600
This one is really exceptional.

01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:16.080
Tell Dad it's our local produce.

01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:21.360
Take me to this cheese.

01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:24.040
Wait. We have to talk to Miłosz first.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:29.960
Let's go.

01:35:37.280 --> 01:35:38.200
And?

01:35:57.520 --> 01:35:58.400
You like?

01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:10.840
Listen, I've got a feeling.

01:36:13.040 --> 01:36:13.880
And?

01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:19.160
- We've got it!
- We've got it!

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:20.440
We have an investor!

01:36:20.520 --> 01:36:22.120
- Got an investor!
- Szyszko!

01:36:22.200 --> 01:36:23.480
We have an investor!

01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:26.880
- Szyszko.
- What Szyszko?

01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:35.280
My husband and I

01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:38.680
want to invest in your dairy.

01:36:41.240 --> 01:36:43.280
It's a little delight.

01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:45.400
- Yeah.
- Miłosz says it's worth it.

01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:49.280
You've got something really special.
It'd be a shame to waste it.

01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:50.280
But…

01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:51.920
Regina.

01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:55.840
It's not a loan.

01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:57.560
It's an investment.

01:36:59.160 --> 01:37:00.160
And a wedding gift.

01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:04.240
If they want to get married in this,
as Pierre calls it,

01:37:04.320 --> 01:37:06.120
barbarian country, then so be it.

01:37:07.680 --> 01:37:10.720
- Even though there was no wedding?
- We'll get married anyway.

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:11.880
No doubt about it.

01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:12.960
- Yes!
- Well done.

01:37:14.880 --> 01:37:15.760
But…

01:37:17.080 --> 01:37:18.840
our milk…

01:37:18.920 --> 01:37:19.880
Black people…

01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:21.960
If the world finds out…

01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:25.360
Jeremi, what if the world finds out?
What does the world know about us?

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:29.960
The world knows about John Paul II
and Wałęsa. And about Lewandowski.

01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:33.120
Jeremi, please.
The world knows that 0.4% BAC is fatal,

01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:35.160
but we have 0.4% BAC for breakfast.

01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:38.120
And that our national garment
is socks with sandals.

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:40.480
- Isn't that what they say?
- It is.

01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:42.200
That's it. We're all equal.

01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:45.680
No more judging.
We all love each other from now on.

01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:48.720
Everyone wants to label everyone.

01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:50.280
We can label you too.

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:51.920
Label as what?

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:53.520
You don't want to know.

01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:55.120
So…

01:37:55.840 --> 01:37:58.160
Son, daughter.

01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:00.760
- Bon voyage!
- Bon voyage!

01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:02.320
Bon voyage! Well done!

01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:05.120
Let's drink.

01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:08.680
- To the young couple!
- Cheers!

01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:10.040
<i>Santé!</i>

01:38:12.480 --> 01:38:13.400
Chop-chop.

01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:16.120
- Are you looking out?
- Yeah!

01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:17.960
Put it here.

01:38:19.400 --> 01:38:20.240
What?

01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:22.240
- He's here!
- He's here?

01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:24.320
- The folder. Here.
- Folder.

01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:27.040
- Good.
- Come.

01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:32.120
Get the door.

01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:36.400
It's locked!

01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:39.400
It got stuck.

01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:41.720
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:38:41.800 --> 01:38:42.960
Welcome.

01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:44.360
- Hello.
- Hello. Welcome.

01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:46.000
I'll get the water.

01:38:46.640 --> 01:38:49.960
- Renia.
- It's fresh. Straight from the tap. Here.

01:38:54.360 --> 01:38:55.360
Here.

01:39:10.320 --> 01:39:11.200
We've got it.

01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:19.120
Well done!

01:39:24.000 --> 01:39:24.960
Congratulations.

01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:26.080
Congratulations.

01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:29.840
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you very much.

01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:31.360
- Happy?
- Very happy.

01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:33.440
Very.

01:39:33.520 --> 01:39:36.080
- Your loss.
- Albert Gajda. Congratulations.

01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:38.880
- We did it.
- Yes.

01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:41.320
Will you stay with him?

01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:45.560
One day I want
to chop him to pieces, the next…

01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:48.160
Put it all back together?

01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:49.640
I get that.

01:39:49.720 --> 01:39:50.640
Got that.

01:39:51.160 --> 01:39:52.040
Here.

01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:54.840
- I'm getting a wedding planning business.
- Attagirl.

01:39:57.120 --> 01:39:59.120
- Please.
- Well done.

01:39:59.200 --> 01:40:00.080
Shall we?

01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:03.560
Good luck.

01:40:04.240 --> 01:40:05.440
Watch out for fires.

01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.200
Will you lead us?

01:40:19.920 --> 01:40:20.840
I'll try.

01:40:32.960 --> 01:40:33.880
Hey.

01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:37.720
- Take this.
- Who are they?

01:40:51.520 --> 01:40:53.200
What's this? Got a problem?

01:40:57.160 --> 01:40:59.240
You can't park here.

01:41:01.760 --> 01:41:03.240
Tomuś. Come here.

01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:09.240
We are looking for a brave woman
who posted video on Internet.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:12.720
- What's he saying?
- They're looking for our women.

01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:16.200
Okay, chill.
We're not giving them up without a fight.

01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:18.760
We saw your women's race.

01:41:18.840 --> 01:41:23.000
We own a chain of dairies and want to sign
an exclusive deal to sell your cheese.

01:41:23.560 --> 01:41:26.200
Together, we'll conquer the world!
You struck gold.

01:41:26.280 --> 01:41:27.280
I'm Rysiek.

01:41:29.720 --> 01:41:30.640
Mirek.

01:41:31.480 --> 01:41:32.840
- Rysiek.
- Hanka.

01:41:37.200 --> 01:41:38.120
Gajda.

01:41:40.520 --> 01:41:41.640
Albert Gajda.

01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:46.360
- Well, baby girl.
- What, Dad?

01:41:46.440 --> 01:41:49.240
- Albert Gajda.
- I didn't think we'd pull this off.

01:41:52.760 --> 01:41:54.440
Miłosz. Hi.

01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:55.800
Regina. Hello.

01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:56.760
Gajda.

01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:59.160
We did it! You were right.

01:42:00.000 --> 01:42:01.200
She's just like you.

01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:20.120
