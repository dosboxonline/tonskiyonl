[speaking indistinctly]

01:23.817 --> 01:27.754
-Okay, so the idea... is that
we're going to be synchronized.
-Yes.

01:27.821 --> 01:31.658
Right, because it's going
to be much more impressive.

01:31.758 --> 01:35.128
Yes, it's called
"Woman Petting Cat."

01:35.228 --> 01:38.064
You can change into a cat?

01:38.131 --> 01:40.300
Well, yes, of course
I can turn into a cat.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.968
I can turn
into anything I like.

01:42.068 --> 01:44.404
That said, I will not be
turning into a cat.

01:44.471 --> 01:46.172
I will be turning into a bird.

01:46.272 --> 01:48.108
-A bird!
-[imitating bird noises]

01:48.174 --> 01:49.476
[chuckles] Why?

01:49.576 --> 01:50.677
Because I'm allergic to cats.

01:50.777 --> 01:51.911
'Cause Shelly's
allergic to cats.

01:51.978 --> 01:53.613
[Shelly] I can't be near them.

01:53.680 --> 01:55.582
And neither of us
could be fucked
changing the title.

01:55.648 --> 01:57.317
Yes. No, you are my catbird.

01:57.417 --> 01:59.652
Wow, this is the most amazing
thing I have ever heard.

01:59.752 --> 02:01.254
-Mmm-hmm, catbird.
-[screams]

02:01.321 --> 02:04.190
This is going to be
a smash success.

02:04.290 --> 02:06.326
When people see
that you can change

02:06.426 --> 02:09.362
from a bird into a woman,

02:09.462 --> 02:11.998
they will be
absolutely captivated.

02:12.098 --> 02:14.134
Yeah, well, that's not
what it's about, Bendy.

02:14.200 --> 02:15.535
[Shelly] No, no.

02:15.635 --> 02:17.337
My power is my power.

02:17.437 --> 02:19.172
My art is my art.

02:19.272 --> 02:21.341
The project isn't about
a woman transforming.

02:21.441 --> 02:25.178
It's about a woman
becoming herself,
like both of us.

02:25.278 --> 02:28.114
Yes, the dance will showcase
our inner selves,

02:28.181 --> 02:31.184
far more than
any meta-human abilities
ever could.

02:31.284 --> 02:34.954
[Madame Rouge]
That is why we make art, Bendy.

02:35.021 --> 02:36.823
The world is complicated,

02:36.890 --> 02:38.691
even when they try
to make it simple.

02:38.791 --> 02:42.462
Weapon, not a weapon,
weapon, not a weapon.
See what I mean?

02:42.529 --> 02:43.530
Absolutely, I do.

02:43.630 --> 02:46.499
Art is the only path.

02:46.566 --> 02:49.335
The only path
through this messy life

02:49.402 --> 02:52.572
is paved with moments
of pure expression.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.707
[imitates explosion]

02:54.807 --> 02:57.177
[Madame Rouge]
What will your dance be?
[gasps]

02:57.243 --> 02:58.978
-My dance?
-Yes.

02:59.045 --> 03:00.847
-[softly] Come on.
-[giggles]

03:01.548 --> 03:02.549

-[laughs in agreement]

03:52.799 --> 03:56.069
It was a lie... all of it.

You may have been able to spin
things with the Sisterhood,

04:03.443 --> 04:04.310
but you can't fool me.

04:04.410 --> 04:07.113
I was there in 1949.

04:07.213 --> 04:11.918
You never wanted to change
the world through art.

04:11.985 --> 04:15.054
You never even
cared about expression.

04:15.121 --> 04:18.625
All you cared about
was influence.

04:18.725 --> 04:21.961
Increasing your influence
and gaining power.

04:22.061 --> 04:23.396
Those weren't lies.

04:23.463 --> 04:26.065
They were just truths
that changed over time.

04:26.132 --> 04:27.967
Shut up!

04:28.067 --> 04:32.138
I have listened to your
holier-than-thou theater critic

04:32.238 --> 04:34.907
bullshit for 30 years.
I'm sick of it.

04:34.974 --> 04:37.243
Fine. Have it your way.

04:37.310 --> 04:38.911
I don't need tea and sympathy.

04:38.978 --> 04:41.648
It's... [sighs deeply]

04:41.748 --> 04:43.149
It's over.

04:43.249 --> 04:45.285
-Just let me go.
-[scoffs]

04:45.351 --> 04:49.155
I'll just hop in
the time machine
and disappear.

04:49.255 --> 04:50.523
The time machine is gone.

04:51.691 --> 04:53.459
I hid it away. [chuckles]

04:53.526 --> 04:55.028
Somewhere you'll never find.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.997
I won't let you ruin
anything else.

04:58.097 --> 04:59.966
I'm ending this.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.668
There's nowhere
left for you to go.

05:01.768 --> 05:02.635
Well, we...

05:03.703 --> 05:05.505
both know that's not true.

05:05.605 --> 05:08.374
Yeah, that little stunt
you pulled with the
Sisterhood of Dada

05:08.474 --> 05:10.143
brought my memories
flooding back.

05:10.209 --> 05:13.346
Finally, I know where I belong.

05:13.446 --> 05:18.051
The Brotherhood of Evil
will welcome me back
with open arms.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.054
The Brotherhood of Evil?

05:21.154 --> 05:22.722
Yeah. Brotherhood of Evil, yup.

05:22.822 --> 05:24.357
[chuckles] Okay.

05:24.457 --> 05:26.192
Niles defeated them.

05:26.292 --> 05:29.696
Not long after you left
on your misguided mission.

05:29.796 --> 05:32.799
So, it's over, Madame Rouge.

05:34.033 --> 05:35.868
The Brotherhood of Evil
is gone.

05:35.968 --> 05:37.170
Now I'll just bring it back.

05:38.471 --> 05:39.305
Mmm-hmm.

05:41.407 --> 05:42.542
What you want...

05:44.043 --> 05:44.911
I can't give you.

05:47.013 --> 05:48.514
What I want...

05:49.482 --> 05:51.017
was taken from me.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.387
Taken from me by you.

05:55.822 --> 05:57.390
You stole my life.

05:57.490 --> 06:01.561
And I will not stop
until I have ended yours.

06:01.661 --> 06:05.031
Well, you keep
saying that, Bendy.

06:05.098 --> 06:07.367
But if you're still
looking for a fight,

06:09.068 --> 06:10.436
why don't you take a shot?

06:12.672 --> 06:15.074
[flapping]

06:18.544 --> 06:22.715
[gasps] Tell me it's not true.

Cliff, you are not going
to believe the dimples
on this thing.

06:27.520 --> 06:30.423
-You went back and got him?
-[Larry] Yeah, I did.

06:30.523 --> 06:31.924
Lare-Bear!

06:32.024 --> 06:33.760
I am so proud of you.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.929
And I wasn't sure
if I was ready to be
a father again.

06:37.029 --> 06:39.098
But when you're raising
a space parasite,

06:39.198 --> 06:40.633
are you ever really ready?

06:40.733 --> 06:41.868
-[chuckles]

06:41.934 --> 06:44.237

so crazy lately.

06:44.303 --> 06:47.273
The flagellation,
Rita's time machine...

06:47.373 --> 06:50.276
We haven't had a chance
to celebrate the good shit.

06:50.376 --> 06:51.744
[gasps] Ooh, yeah.

06:51.811 --> 06:53.079
Can I hold it? Please.

06:53.146 --> 06:55.281
-Um...
-[Cliff babbles playfully]

06:55.381 --> 06:57.150
[Jane] Keeg-a-boo. [chuckles]

06:57.250 --> 06:59.218
Wait, is it peek-a-boo
or keeg-a-boo?

06:59.285 --> 07:00.286
Yeah, I think it's "peek."

07:00.386 --> 07:01.821
[Cliff and Jane] Keeg-a-boo!

07:01.921 --> 07:04.056
You know, I should probably
put him down for a nap.

07:04.123 --> 07:05.992
He might be getting tired.

07:06.092 --> 07:08.661
-Keeg-a-boo!
-There will be plenty of time
to play later.

07:08.761 --> 07:10.163
-[Cliff] Keeg-a-boo!
-[Jane blows raspberry]

07:10.263 --> 07:11.798
-Hey, if I could--
-You don't really think

07:11.898 --> 07:14.333
that we're going to give it
back to you, do you?

07:15.168 --> 07:16.135
[Jane] Yeah.

07:16.235 --> 07:17.837
No hard feelings, Mummy-daddy.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.939
It's just...

07:20.006 --> 07:23.443
you're not really capable
of fatherly love.

07:23.509 --> 07:25.011
Think about
what happened to your son.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.279
[Cliff] He killed himself.

07:26.345 --> 07:27.914
[Jane] No, not that son,
the other son.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.149
The one who decided
that the best relationship

07:30.249 --> 07:32.652
they could manage
was no relationship at all.

07:32.752 --> 07:34.320
What? No, I don't--

07:34.420 --> 07:36.155
That's not-- [exhales]

07:36.255 --> 07:38.758
I can be a better father
than either of you.

07:38.825 --> 07:40.593
[both laugh]

07:42.161 --> 07:43.496
I am ready for this.

07:46.666 --> 07:49.135
[Cliff and Jane]
"I am ready for this!"

07:49.202 --> 07:50.970
I can be better.

07:51.037 --> 07:52.038
I have to be.

07:53.606 --> 07:54.874
I have to be better.

07:55.842 --> 07:57.677
[laughing hysterically]

07:59.045 --> 07:59.946
[gasps]

08:02.515 --> 08:03.816
Oh, my God. [sighs]

08:04.851 --> 08:05.885
What the...

08:05.985 --> 08:07.153
[chains rattling]

08:10.957 --> 08:12.058
Did you do this?

08:13.626 --> 08:15.361
Wait.

08:15.461 --> 08:18.231
The dream.
You felt it, didn't you?

08:20.466 --> 08:22.969
You can sense my emotions.

08:23.035 --> 08:24.971
[sighs]
My old friend could too.

08:26.305 --> 08:28.241
This feels different somehow.

08:28.975 --> 08:30.309
Painful.

08:30.376 --> 08:31.577
I'm scared.

08:34.213 --> 08:36.315
I can sense your emotions too.

08:36.382 --> 08:38.985
-[static buzzing]
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:43.322 --> 08:46.392
Being around me and my problems
can feel like torture.

08:48.528 --> 08:51.597
This time, I have to be better.

09:01.707 --> 09:02.875
Procedure was painless.

09:04.577 --> 09:07.213
Basically, they rewrote
the nanotech that you designed.

09:08.681 --> 09:10.049
Underneath...

09:10.116 --> 09:11.918
I'm still mechanical.

09:12.018 --> 09:13.619
Changes are only skin deep.

09:15.187 --> 09:16.389
Only cost you your powers.

09:18.024 --> 09:20.726
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean that to sound...

09:22.428 --> 09:23.596
[sighs]

09:23.696 --> 09:25.698
I've had a lot of time
to reflect lately.

09:25.765 --> 09:27.199
The whole world has.

09:27.266 --> 09:28.701
Thanks to...

09:28.768 --> 09:31.103
whatever the hell
we all just went through...

09:31.203 --> 09:33.639
[interrupts] Don't explain it.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.441
I really don't need to know.

09:35.541 --> 09:36.576
Just glad it's over.

09:38.210 --> 09:39.612
It's not very often that, uh,

09:39.712 --> 09:41.881
I get to visit my son
in a hospital these days.

09:45.618 --> 09:46.485
First time?

09:47.887 --> 09:48.955
Greatest day of my life.

09:50.089 --> 09:50.923
No lie.

09:50.990 --> 09:52.959
And you were a newborn.

09:53.059 --> 09:54.226
And I promised to keep you

09:54.293 --> 09:56.095
from ending up back
in that hospital.

09:56.963 --> 09:57.797
But...

09:59.065 --> 10:00.499
real life doesn't work
like that.

10:02.668 --> 10:04.303
-Yeah.
-Second time.

10:04.403 --> 10:06.138
You had appendicitis.

10:06.238 --> 10:08.808
Oof! Boy, you're tough.

10:08.908 --> 10:10.276
Didn't let your mom
see you cry.

10:15.081 --> 10:17.016
Third time.

10:17.116 --> 10:20.586
Third time was
right after your first
varsity football game.

10:22.254 --> 10:23.456
You'd sprained your ankle.

10:24.757 --> 10:26.492
But you gritted it out.

10:26.592 --> 10:30.963
You threw the go-ahead
score to win it all.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.834
I should have been
happy for you,

10:36.135 --> 10:38.004
but I was angry.

10:38.104 --> 10:40.506
Angry because if the injury
were any worse,

10:40.606 --> 10:42.808
that might have been
your last game.

10:42.875 --> 10:44.710
And I wasn't there for it.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.979
I figured you had
to work late, so...

10:49.682 --> 10:52.852
There was a new security guard
at S.T.A.R. Labs.

10:54.353 --> 10:55.321
It was dark out.

10:56.956 --> 10:59.358
I was rushing to make it
to your game.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.461
But, man, I couldn't find
my damn keys.

11:05.231 --> 11:06.298
That man...

11:08.501 --> 11:10.202
he made assumptions.

11:12.838 --> 11:13.706
He stalked me.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.307
Detained me.

11:16.142 --> 11:17.810
He held me down.

11:19.045 --> 11:20.079
I can still hear him.

11:21.147 --> 11:22.648
He was overweight, wheezing...

11:24.884 --> 11:25.818
I could've taken him.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.054
But what then?

11:30.189 --> 11:32.058
Would he have tried to kill me?

11:32.158 --> 11:34.226
Would he have pressed charges?

11:34.326 --> 11:35.895
There are wings
of that building

11:35.995 --> 11:37.863
that will be named after me.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.732
And in less than a millisecond,

11:39.832 --> 11:43.703
everything I had earned
meant absolutely nothing.

11:45.171 --> 11:46.372
[sighs] Dad.

11:50.543 --> 11:51.510
I never knew.

11:54.914 --> 11:56.348
You weren't
born yesterday, Victor.

11:57.850 --> 11:59.218
You live in the same
world I do.

12:03.089 --> 12:04.590
You didn't need
your father to tell you

12:04.690 --> 12:06.559
that this is how it is!

12:11.564 --> 12:15.101
Anyway,
that moment right there

12:15.201 --> 12:16.936
was all I could think about

12:17.036 --> 12:18.604
the last time
you were in the hospital.

12:19.905 --> 12:21.707
A moment where I had a choice.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.277
Not just to save my son's life,

12:25.377 --> 12:28.581
but to give him
a suit of armor. [sighs]

12:28.647 --> 12:33.786
To build it into something
the world could not tear down,

12:33.886 --> 12:37.957
build him into something
that could walk the world free.

12:39.892 --> 12:42.595
You once asked me
why I chose to make you Cyborg.

12:50.236 --> 12:51.270
That's the answer.

12:54.573 --> 12:55.808
[sighs]

12:55.908 --> 12:57.443
That might be your answer...

12:59.411 --> 13:01.614
but that was not the solution.

13:03.182 --> 13:04.617
I mean,
don't you recognize that?

13:06.519 --> 13:08.854
Like... after all that,

13:11.157 --> 13:14.593
what the hell
did you turn me into?

13:14.660 --> 13:17.363
I am a S.T.A.R. Lab
security guard!

13:17.463 --> 13:20.499
You traded my humanity
for a symbol.

13:21.767 --> 13:23.369
You robbed me of the chance
to define myself.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.938
Why the hell would I give
a fuck about how people see me?

13:27.640 --> 13:31.043
I've been standing
before my father
this entire time,

13:31.143 --> 13:32.845
appearing as the man
I used to be,

13:32.945 --> 13:34.480
and he won't even embrace me.

13:35.648 --> 13:38.517
[scoffs] He can't even
look at me.

13:38.617 --> 13:41.887
My own father won't
even bring himself
to hug his own son.

13:43.122 --> 13:44.857
All he can think about is fear.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.795
You wanted me to walk
through this world free?

13:51.564 --> 13:54.800
Well, I want to walk the world
as the man I was born to be.

14:00.973 --> 14:03.876
[door opens, shuts]

14:03.976 --> 14:06.345
[sobs]

14:13.419 --> 14:14.854
Kay, wait.

14:14.920 --> 14:17.523
We need to talk
about what happened.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.758
The others, where did they go?

14:19.859 --> 14:23.229
I don't know where they went,
but I'm glad they're gone.

14:23.329 --> 14:25.731
They knew
I didn't need them anymore.

14:25.831 --> 14:28.400
I want to feel like I did
in the sweet shop again.

14:29.168 --> 14:30.035
In the fog.

14:35.174 --> 14:40.579
I like that feeling too,
but it couldn't last forever.

14:40.679 --> 14:42.014
I know what you're feeling.

14:42.081 --> 14:44.049
I know what you want.

14:44.116 --> 14:48.454
But things aren't always as
simple as we want them to be.

14:48.554 --> 14:50.222
Let's just think for a moment.

14:50.289 --> 14:52.725
You must be wondering
what happened to the others.

14:52.791 --> 14:53.726
I am too.

14:53.792 --> 14:56.428
We can figure it out together.

14:56.528 --> 14:59.265
Sometimes I wonder
if you understand me at all.

15:09.775 --> 15:10.609
God!

15:14.113 --> 15:17.783
[distant screaming]

15:20.386 --> 15:23.555
[distant growls]

15:25.224 --> 15:26.892
I hope you know
what you're doing, Kay.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.496
I don't think this place
is meant to be empty.

15:38.137 --> 15:40.172
[line ringing]

15:43.509 --> 15:45.644
[Mallah on intercom]<i> Hello,</i>
<i>who may I ask is calling?</i>

15:45.744 --> 15:47.179
[Laura] Yeah, it's... It's me.

15:47.279 --> 15:49.448
It's Laura. Laura De Mille.

15:49.515 --> 15:50.349
[Mallah]<i> Who?</i>

15:50.449 --> 15:51.784
Ah, sorry.

15:51.850 --> 15:53.452
Madame Rouge.

15:54.353 --> 15:55.287
[Mallah]<i> Who?</i>

15:55.354 --> 15:56.855
[mumbles]

15:56.956 --> 15:58.657
Fair enough.

15:58.757 --> 16:02.661
[clears throat]
1949, I was recruited to travel
to the future,

16:02.761 --> 16:05.030
which is now-now, present time.

16:05.130 --> 16:08.167
Um, my mission went
a bit sideways.

16:08.267 --> 16:11.470
Therefore, I'm no longer able
to travel back to my present.

16:11.537 --> 16:15.140
So I'm currently here
in your present...

16:15.207 --> 16:16.875
presently.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.811
Reporting for duty, sir.

16:20.212 --> 16:21.180
[Mallah]<i> No.</i>

16:22.514 --> 16:25.517
Oh. [chuckles]
Sorry, your accent.

16:25.617 --> 16:26.885
You sounded like you said no.

16:26.986 --> 16:28.287
[Mallah]<i> I said no.</i>

16:28.354 --> 16:29.855
<i>You are not welcome here.</i>

16:29.955 --> 16:31.857
<i>This is a retirement community.</i>

16:31.957 --> 16:33.192
<i>We are retired.</i>

16:33.292 --> 16:35.327
<i>We have no need</i>
<i>for this frivolity.</i>

16:35.394 --> 16:38.063
<i>Your absurd</i>
<i>and overly complicated problems</i>

16:38.163 --> 16:39.198
<i>are not welcome here.</i>

16:39.298 --> 16:40.632
Okay, um, my apologies,

16:40.699 --> 16:42.868
but, um, perhaps
I'm in the wrong place.

16:42.968 --> 16:44.837
But I was told
that I could find

16:44.903 --> 16:47.873
the... [whispers]
Brotherhood of Evil here.

16:47.973 --> 16:49.808
[The Brain]
<i>What's going on, Mallah?</i>

16:49.875 --> 16:51.710
<i>Did I hear</i>
<i>someone mention</i>
<i>the Brotherhood of Evil?</i>

16:51.810 --> 16:52.911
Yes. Yes.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.413
[The Brain]
<i>Is it one of our fans,</i>

16:54.513 --> 16:56.215
<i>or a member</i>
<i>of the enthusiast press?</i>

16:56.315 --> 16:58.684
[Mallah] Pardon, monsieur.
<i>It is none of your concern.</i>

16:58.751 --> 17:00.419
[The Brain]<i> None of my concern?</i>

17:00.519 --> 17:03.422
<i>Unless it's another one of your</i>
<i>taffy-of-the-month deliveries,</i>

17:03.522 --> 17:05.924
<i>it's absolutely my concern.</i>

17:06.025 --> 17:07.226
<i>Buzz them in.</i>

17:07.326 --> 17:09.361
-[Mallah sighs]
-[buzzer sounds]

17:09.428 --> 17:11.530
Okay. Thank you.
Thanks very much

17:13.665 --> 17:14.700
[mechanical thudding]

17:22.341 --> 17:23.342
Yo, Cliff!

17:25.577 --> 17:28.113
You got to be
fucking kidding me.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.782
Nice to see you too.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.083
Is this real?

17:31.183 --> 17:33.786
Or did a magic bird
do this shit to you too?

17:33.886 --> 17:35.020
It's real.

17:35.087 --> 17:36.922
Uh, it's still tech,
but it's real.

17:37.022 --> 17:40.259
-What do you think?
-What do I think?

17:40.359 --> 17:42.961
What the fuck does
General Tony think?

17:44.963 --> 17:45.898
[scoffs]

17:53.238 --> 17:57.576
So this, Kay, is
the Brotherhood of Evil.

17:57.643 --> 18:01.547
They're a group of the most
sinister villains of all time

18:01.613 --> 18:03.315
in the 1950s.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.950
They're horrible.

18:05.050 --> 18:08.087
And the worst one of them all,
of course, is Madame Rouge.

18:08.153 --> 18:09.388
But not to worry.

18:09.455 --> 18:10.622
I have come up with a plan

18:10.722 --> 18:12.891
to vanquish them
once and for all.

18:12.958 --> 18:16.795
Speaking of, what sort of
superpowers do you have?

18:16.895 --> 18:18.163
Oh. [chuckles nervously]

18:18.263 --> 18:19.798
I don't have powers.

18:19.898 --> 18:23.969
-I see. And the other personas?
-They're gone.

18:24.770 --> 18:25.671
It's just me.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.774
How lovely.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.142
Wow. [chuckles]

18:30.242 --> 18:34.279
Well, we are so happy to have
you aboard, Kay.

18:34.847 --> 18:35.781
Welcome.

18:37.316 --> 18:38.317
[Vic] What'd we miss?

18:42.187 --> 18:44.289
Yup, I'm back.

18:44.356 --> 18:45.691
Victor, what have you done?

18:46.959 --> 18:47.993
What have I done?

18:48.093 --> 18:50.496
[exhales] Sorry. I mean...

18:50.596 --> 18:52.764
look at you. [chuckles]

18:52.831 --> 18:54.166
Congratulations.

18:54.266 --> 18:55.968
You look amazing.

18:56.034 --> 18:57.836
Yeah, we're all thrilled
for Vic.

18:57.936 --> 18:59.505
But I'm still
a little confused,

18:59.605 --> 19:02.107
like, why did you
even come back?

19:02.841 --> 19:03.809
I live here.

19:07.045 --> 19:08.514
Guys, come on.

19:08.614 --> 19:10.482
I'm not a subconscious.

19:10.549 --> 19:13.352
I'm not a zombie,
and this isn't the afterlife.

19:13.452 --> 19:15.521
It's still me, same Vic.

19:15.621 --> 19:16.622
Still part of the team.

19:16.688 --> 19:18.290
Do you still have powers?

19:18.991 --> 19:20.192
No.

19:20.292 --> 19:21.693
[Cliff] Let's arm wrestle.

19:21.793 --> 19:24.129
Winner gets to call himself
Cyborg from now on.

19:24.196 --> 19:25.364
[Rita] Cliff!

19:25.464 --> 19:27.699
I'm sorry.
It's just a lot to process.

19:27.799 --> 19:30.736
You spent 30 years in the past
and didn't change at all.

19:30.836 --> 19:34.306
Vic goes away
for a three-day weekend
and changes everything.

19:34.373 --> 19:35.807
[Rita] Well, who said
I didn't change?

19:35.874 --> 19:37.876
[Larry] Hey, can you guys
keep it down, please?

19:37.976 --> 19:39.311
[parasite growling]

19:39.378 --> 19:40.646
[sighs] Sorry, I'm late.

19:42.381 --> 19:44.249
Trying to take things
a bit easier these days,

19:44.349 --> 19:46.018
you know, for the baby.

19:46.084 --> 19:49.521
Unless that thing's colorblind,
you're only making life harder.

19:49.588 --> 19:50.989
I like it.

19:51.056 --> 19:52.391
Thanks, Kay.

19:52.491 --> 19:56.395
Kay? Holy shit!
Has everyone fixed their shit?

19:56.495 --> 19:59.831
Slap on some synth skin
or some fucking Tommy Bahama

19:59.898 --> 20:02.100
and everyone's problems
are solved.

20:02.201 --> 20:03.368
I'm beginning to wonder

20:03.435 --> 20:05.537
we all had the same
flagellation.

20:05.604 --> 20:06.672
Welcome back, Vic.

20:06.738 --> 20:08.907
-You look great.
-Thanks, Larry.

20:09.007 --> 20:11.777
[clears throat] All right.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.446
Okay, this may feel
a bit like deja vu,

20:14.546 --> 20:17.182
but that's only because
we've tried this once before

20:17.249 --> 20:18.684
when you were all subs.

20:18.750 --> 20:22.955
But now that the actual
team is here,

20:24.089 --> 20:26.925
I believe we finally
have a chance.

20:27.025 --> 20:29.728
Jane always says
you're not a team.

20:29.795 --> 20:32.231
Well, Jane's not right
about everything, Kay.

20:32.297 --> 20:34.433
You know that better
than any of us.

20:34.533 --> 20:36.902
All right. Take two, huh?

20:36.969 --> 20:40.272
Introducing the
Brotherhood of Evil.

20:40.372 --> 20:42.975
[The Brain] Welcome
to our new headquarters.

20:43.075 --> 20:46.111
I never doubted for a second
that you would return to us.

20:46.211 --> 20:48.614
Welcome!
Mallah, welcome our guest!

20:48.714 --> 20:51.883
-[growls]
-[The Brain] He's in a mood.

20:51.950 --> 20:53.885
So, Rouge, my darling,

20:53.952 --> 20:55.387
where have you been
all my life?

20:55.454 --> 20:59.891
Uh, I've been a bit,
um, bit lost, actually.

21:01.059 --> 21:02.661
How have things been here?

21:02.761 --> 21:04.596
Things are going great.

21:04.663 --> 21:05.998
You can't beat the climate.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.000
We're only a couple minutes
from the beach.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.602
The Buccaneers won
the Super Bowl.

21:10.669 --> 21:14.673
You know what they say,
"Boca Raton means
'Heaven on Earth.'"

21:14.773 --> 21:17.142
Right. Well, how wonderful.
I'm very happy,

21:17.242 --> 21:18.477
very happy for you.

21:19.945 --> 21:21.280
Both of you.

21:21.346 --> 21:23.515
[Mallah]<i> Fermez la bouche,</i>
<i>femme demon.</i>

21:24.416 --> 21:26.084
Um... sorry, ape.

21:26.151 --> 21:28.787
-Do you... do you have
some kind of a problem?
-[whirring]

21:29.955 --> 21:30.789
Hmm?

21:34.793 --> 21:38.297
Yeah. Uh, things aren't
going as well for me,

21:38.363 --> 21:39.631
I'm afraid, so...

21:39.698 --> 21:41.366
I assumed.

21:41.466 --> 21:44.670
We basically sent you
on the time-travel
equivalent of a milk run

21:44.770 --> 21:46.171
and you never came back.

21:46.271 --> 21:49.441
Uh, yeah. Well, you neglected
to inform me

21:49.508 --> 21:53.979
that total amnesia is
a side effect of time travel.

21:54.479 --> 21:55.781
Amnesia?

21:55.847 --> 21:59.518
Interesting. What an oddly
convenient symptom.

21:59.618 --> 22:04.456
Yes. Well, the original mission
relied on using my anonymity

22:04.523 --> 22:07.526
to spy on Niles Caulder
and his creations.

22:07.626 --> 22:09.861
But unfortunately,
I instead relied

22:09.961 --> 22:13.332
on Niles Caulder's creations
to undo my anonymity

22:13.398 --> 22:18.136
and effectively
ran a mission counter
to the original goal.

22:20.238 --> 22:24.009
So now,
they are plotting to kill me.

22:24.076 --> 22:25.577
Which is great.

22:25.677 --> 22:29.181
Hmm, that sounds more
like a Rouge problem

22:29.247 --> 22:31.183
than a Brain problem.

22:31.249 --> 22:35.887
Um... [scoffs] I'm sorry...

22:35.987 --> 22:40.225
Aren't I an equal member
of the Brotherhood of Evil?

22:40.325 --> 22:43.528
Well, there's members,
and there's equal members.

22:43.595 --> 22:46.932
You were a member
for, like, an afternoon.

22:47.766 --> 22:49.201
Let's cut to the chase.

22:53.004 --> 22:56.441
I need to destroy
Niles Caulder's creations

22:56.541 --> 22:58.076
before they destroy me.

22:58.176 --> 23:01.079
And there is no one better
to do that than you,

23:01.179 --> 23:04.549
Niles Caulder's sworn nemesis.

23:04.616 --> 23:05.917
What can I say?

23:06.017 --> 23:07.586
He really did bring out
the villain in me.

23:07.686 --> 23:10.455
Seventy years ago,
you sent me on a mission.

23:10.555 --> 23:13.024
It went off course,
but I'm here now,

23:13.091 --> 23:16.228
and Niles Caulder's legacy
is ripe for destruction.

23:16.294 --> 23:19.030
So are you in
or are you out?

23:20.966 --> 23:23.935
Mallah, get me my toys.

23:24.035 --> 23:26.204
-[growls]
-[juicer whirs]

23:26.271 --> 23:28.140
-Mallah!
-[Mallah]<i> Pardon?</i>

23:28.240 --> 23:29.441
-I said get--
-[juicer whirs]

23:30.709 --> 23:31.743
Damn it, Mallah.

23:33.879 --> 23:36.982
[Larry] Hey, wasn't
the Brotherhood of Evil
defeated ages ago?

23:37.082 --> 23:38.550
Maybe this will just blow over.

23:38.617 --> 23:41.586
No, Larry, the Brotherhood
of Evil is coming for us.

23:41.653 --> 23:42.988
I'm sure of it.

23:43.088 --> 23:45.390
Don't worry, Rita.
I've got your back.

23:45.457 --> 23:47.592
-We'll figure it out.
-[Rita] Well, thank you.

23:47.659 --> 23:49.494
Victor.

23:49.594 --> 23:52.097
I suppose we can find
a role for you.

23:52.664 --> 23:53.465
What?

23:53.565 --> 23:54.633
You're demoting me?

23:54.733 --> 23:56.635
There are
no small roles, Victor.

23:56.735 --> 23:59.471
Only small actors
and stage crew.

23:59.571 --> 24:01.239
Can I be stage crew with Vic?

24:01.306 --> 24:02.974
Hey, what the hell
is stage crew?

24:03.074 --> 24:05.444
What Rita's too polite to say
is that you screwed us, dude.

24:05.510 --> 24:08.647
I sold a meet and greet
with Cyborg on eBay.

24:08.747 --> 24:12.417
And, sure, my subconscious self
showed me that was wrong.

24:12.484 --> 24:14.252
But what the fuck
am I supposed to do now?

24:14.319 --> 24:16.154
Issue a $25 refund?

24:16.254 --> 24:18.623
[Larry] Okay, okay. Let's just
try to keep the volume
down a bit, okay?

24:18.690 --> 24:19.991
Vic doesn't deserve this.

24:20.091 --> 24:23.428
-[crackling]
-Oh, shit. [groans] I'm fine.

24:23.495 --> 24:24.663
It's fine.

24:24.763 --> 24:27.265
Kids, am I right?
[chuckles nervously]

24:27.332 --> 24:28.800
-Uh.
-[Cliff] Who would
have thought that

24:28.867 --> 24:30.969
a deadbeat Robodad
with a brain disease

24:31.036 --> 24:33.505
is the only capable member
left on the team.

24:33.605 --> 24:34.706
Larry's got a baby.

24:34.806 --> 24:37.442
Vic's depowered,
and Jane's head is empty.

24:37.509 --> 24:39.644
We're two bananas short
of a dogshit sundae.

24:39.711 --> 24:42.481
Don't you dare
lump me in with them.

24:42.547 --> 24:45.650
I'll have you know I am
perfectly capable on my own.

24:45.717 --> 24:49.621
Well, then why the hell do you
keep trying to recruit us?

24:52.791 --> 24:54.726
All right. I'm sorry.

24:54.826 --> 24:56.528
I'm trying to turn over
a new leaf.

24:56.628 --> 24:59.197
This isn't exactly
how I planned to start,

24:59.297 --> 25:01.967
but if you need help
kicking some evil ass,

25:02.033 --> 25:04.002
I'm ready to fucking roll.

25:04.069 --> 25:05.704
[sighs, laughs]

25:05.804 --> 25:08.340
-Okay.
-[doorbell rings]

25:10.075 --> 25:12.744
-[Clara] Dad?
-Holy shit. Clara!

25:16.014 --> 25:19.017
Every single time.

25:28.326 --> 25:30.428
Get a load of this stuff.

25:30.529 --> 25:31.997
When I first got into the game,

25:32.063 --> 25:34.733
laser beams weren't
even that thing.

25:34.833 --> 25:37.102
I put laser beams on the map.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.103
This is it?

25:39.170 --> 25:40.405
No, of course not.

25:40.505 --> 25:43.542
I've got tons more
at an off-site facility.

25:43.608 --> 25:45.844
I had a death ray,
but I gave it to Garguax

25:45.911 --> 25:50.081
so he could kill that leggy
broad who time-traveled
to Codsville after you left--

25:50.181 --> 25:52.050
Don't ask me
how I figured all that out.

25:52.117 --> 25:57.255
Well, that leggy broad
managed to survive
your little death ray.

25:57.355 --> 26:01.526
So I hope you've got something
with a more airtight success
rate up your sleeve.

26:02.594 --> 26:04.429
Not so fast.

26:06.031 --> 26:07.966
This is the
Brotherhood of Evil.

26:08.066 --> 26:09.434
I'm The Brain.

26:09.534 --> 26:10.869
He's Mallah,

26:10.936 --> 26:13.772
and you're the lady
who hasn't done jack shit.

26:13.872 --> 26:15.407
You've got to earn our help.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.777
Are you ready
for another mission?

26:20.378 --> 26:22.247
[Clara] You left your meds
in Florida.

26:23.949 --> 26:26.418
-These are some
pretty serious pills.
-[thuds]

26:29.087 --> 26:31.656
The website said
they were safe.

26:31.756 --> 26:34.726
Website? Dad, Jesus!

26:36.995 --> 26:37.896
[sobs]

26:37.963 --> 26:39.297
I didn't even want to come,

26:39.397 --> 26:41.733
but Mel told me that this
Parkinson's medication

26:41.800 --> 26:43.468
has some pretty serious
side effects,

26:43.568 --> 26:47.939
especially if you're not
taking regulated doses.

26:48.006 --> 26:50.075
What sort of side effects?

26:50.141 --> 26:52.510
Impulse control,
gambling, lust.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.779
Things you weren't exactly
a shining example of

26:54.846 --> 26:57.182
before you started
taking medication.

26:57.282 --> 26:59.484
Now that I'm seeing you, I...

26:59.584 --> 27:03.521
Look, I think I need
to take you to see a doctor.

27:03.622 --> 27:04.756
Like, a real doctor.

27:18.837 --> 27:19.704
[Vic] Kay?

27:22.107 --> 27:23.041
What are you doing down here?

27:27.445 --> 27:31.182
Everyone inside my head
got to sit at this table

27:32.450 --> 27:33.652
and talk to Mr. Caulder.

27:35.854 --> 27:36.821
But I never did.

27:38.723 --> 27:41.359
I guess no one ever
wanted to talk to me.

27:41.459 --> 27:42.961
We all wanted
to talk to you, Kay.

27:44.029 --> 27:46.231
Ask any of us,
Niles most of all.

27:46.331 --> 27:48.566
But we thought maybe
you didn't want to talk to us.

27:49.968 --> 27:51.536
They never let me come up.

27:51.636 --> 27:53.672
[breathing heavily]

27:56.041 --> 27:58.510
I always thought it was
because they were
trying to keep me safe.

27:58.576 --> 28:02.981
But now I think they were
just trying to keep this
all for themselves.

28:03.048 --> 28:04.716
Why did you decide
to come up now?

28:05.984 --> 28:07.218
Did something happen to Jane?

28:07.318 --> 28:08.253
[sighs]

28:09.587 --> 28:10.555
Jane's fine.

28:12.590 --> 28:13.558
[slow sobs]

28:15.326 --> 28:21.399
She's just in the underground
like I used to be.

28:23.001 --> 28:24.035
It's a good thing.

28:29.174 --> 28:31.409
For the first time
in a long time,

28:31.509 --> 28:34.713
I finally feel like the person
I was supposed to be.

28:37.916 --> 28:38.950
[sighs]

28:39.751 --> 28:41.019
I know how that feels.

28:43.288 --> 28:44.289
[exhales]

28:46.091 --> 28:47.459
I thought you might.

28:49.461 --> 28:53.465
-I think part of us
met during, um--
-The flagellation?

28:54.265 --> 28:56.034
Yeah. [chuckles]

28:56.101 --> 28:59.104
I think our subconsciouses
are more similar
than I gave us credit for.

29:02.540 --> 29:03.775
You mean I'm like you?

29:05.710 --> 29:07.312
Like looking in the mirror.

29:07.412 --> 29:08.780
[chuckles]

29:10.081 --> 29:11.382
I'm happy for you, Kay.

29:13.885 --> 29:16.154
I let people call the shots
for me for too long.

29:17.388 --> 29:18.623
And I know you did too.

29:20.658 --> 29:23.094
We're finally in charge
of ourselves again.

29:31.836 --> 29:32.937
Um, excuse me.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.609
Do you think
you could interview me

29:37.675 --> 29:39.310
like Mr. Caulder used to do?

29:53.024 --> 29:54.025
[giggles]

29:57.929 --> 30:00.498
[clears throat]

30:00.598 --> 30:04.936
-[in formal accent] So, what
would you like to talk about?
-[Kay giggles]

30:14.045 --> 30:15.980
[Larry] Rita,
what are you doing?

30:16.047 --> 30:18.516
I'm leaving, Larry.
I'm going after Rouge.

30:18.616 --> 30:21.386
I don't care if anyone
wants to help me or not.

30:21.486 --> 30:24.522
I can't stay here
while she's out there free.

30:24.622 --> 30:26.057
Okay? What happened to you two?

30:26.157 --> 30:27.992
You were so desperate
for her approval.

30:28.059 --> 30:29.460
And now you seem so...

30:30.962 --> 30:32.530
This feels personal.

30:32.630 --> 30:33.464
Laura--

30:34.699 --> 30:39.637
I mean, Rouge...
and I have history.

30:39.704 --> 30:43.708
Now I know you think I was
only gone for a few days,

30:43.808 --> 30:47.378
but for me,
it was an entire lifetime.

30:47.478 --> 30:49.347
Well, judging by
the pink cardigan packed

30:49.414 --> 30:51.049
beside the one-piece
bathing suit,

30:51.149 --> 30:53.918
I'd say you're still the same
Rita we all know and love.

30:54.018 --> 30:55.854
That Rita is gone, Larry.

30:55.920 --> 30:58.890
-[parasite growls]
-[Larry groans]

30:59.657 --> 31:00.525
[glass cracks]

31:01.359 --> 31:03.228
Sorry.

31:03.328 --> 31:04.262
Sorry about that.

31:05.096 --> 31:06.364
I overreacted.

31:06.431 --> 31:08.099
[shushes]

31:09.767 --> 31:12.670
Change can be positive.

31:14.672 --> 31:17.909
Still the same Larry
we all know and love.

31:19.944 --> 31:20.778
[kisses]

31:22.947 --> 31:25.216
Good luck with your thing.

31:29.020 --> 31:31.089
How long will you be gone?

31:31.189 --> 31:35.260
I don't know, Larry.
Rouge could be anywhere by now.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.128
Do you know how difficult
it's going to be

31:37.228 --> 31:38.796
to track down a shapeshifter?

31:43.101 --> 31:46.304
Hi. Yeah. I'd like to make
an appointment for my father.

31:47.605 --> 31:48.907
Cliff Steele.

31:48.973 --> 31:50.375
[baby cooing]

31:50.441 --> 31:52.410
Yes, that's his real name.

31:53.611 --> 31:54.913
Hello.

31:54.979 --> 31:58.983
I'm sorry. Could I borrow you
for one moment?

31:59.083 --> 32:00.084
[Cliff] Uh...

32:04.422 --> 32:05.556
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

32:05.623 --> 32:07.458
I'm sorry. This is important.

32:07.558 --> 32:10.128
More important than
my daughter setting up
a doctor's appointment

32:10.228 --> 32:11.930
for my debilitating
brain disease?

32:11.996 --> 32:16.834
Yes. Something about this
doesn't add up.

32:17.902 --> 32:20.805
Are you sure that's Clara?

32:20.905 --> 32:22.974
Am I sure
that's my daughter? Yeah.

32:23.074 --> 32:27.578
But have you considered this?
Madame Rouge is a shapeshifter.

32:27.645 --> 32:28.980
Uh, yeah.

32:29.080 --> 32:31.616
I saw her transform
into an ottoman. Big whoop.

32:31.683 --> 32:34.652
She can transform
into anything.

32:34.752 --> 32:36.988
I don't give a shit.

32:37.088 --> 32:38.823
I just want to make sure
you're being careful.

32:38.923 --> 32:40.625
Think about it.

32:40.692 --> 32:41.826
After everything,

32:41.926 --> 32:43.494
do you really think
you've earned

32:43.594 --> 32:46.364
another second chance
with your daughter?

32:46.464 --> 32:47.765
Come on, Rita.

32:47.832 --> 32:50.268
Can't something nice happen
to me for once?

32:50.335 --> 32:52.503
Vic got his whole
fucking face fixed.

32:52.603 --> 32:54.539
All of you are doing
better than ever.

32:54.639 --> 32:56.507
Don't I get to have
something nice?

32:56.607 --> 32:58.009
Just once?

32:58.109 --> 33:00.712
Why does everyone else
get to be so fucking special?

33:03.948 --> 33:04.983
[sighs]

33:05.817 --> 33:06.951
You're right.

33:07.018 --> 33:09.988
This does feel
too good to be true.

33:10.621 --> 33:11.656
I'm sorry.

33:12.790 --> 33:15.059
Just go back in there

33:15.159 --> 33:17.895
and I'll gather the others,
just... just in case.

33:21.299 --> 33:23.201
Hey, sweetie, you'd tell me

33:23.301 --> 33:27.238
if you were a secret
shapeshifter here to fuck up
my life, wouldn't you?

33:28.072 --> 33:30.308
[baby blabbering]

33:30.375 --> 33:31.642
Hey, little buddy.

33:32.643 --> 33:33.878
Where did your mama go?

33:34.846 --> 33:36.180
All right.

33:36.814 --> 33:37.749
Come here.

33:38.816 --> 33:40.084
Here we go.

33:40.184 --> 33:41.719
[Clara] Sorry, I had to go
change his diaper.

33:42.820 --> 33:43.755
[gasps]

33:46.991 --> 33:48.059
[Cliff and Clara]
What the fuck?

33:48.159 --> 33:52.330
[baby crying violently]

33:52.397 --> 33:54.265
[growls]

33:54.365 --> 33:55.600
Clara, run!

33:55.700 --> 33:57.568
-[baby snickering]
-[Cliff shrieks]

34:01.739 --> 34:03.007
[screams]

34:05.043 --> 34:05.843
[Cliff] Look out!

34:05.910 --> 34:07.345
It's a killer baby!

34:08.012 --> 34:09.514
[screams]

34:13.251 --> 34:14.752
[baby screams]

34:14.852 --> 34:16.888
[all grunting]

34:16.954 --> 34:17.855
[Vic] I got her!

34:22.593 --> 34:25.730
[grunting]

34:30.601 --> 34:31.936
[groans]

34:32.036 --> 34:34.906
[Madame Rouge]
Hey, you bastard! Oh!

34:34.972 --> 34:36.441
[parasite crying]

34:36.541 --> 34:39.444
[groaning]

34:39.544 --> 34:40.378
Okay.

34:41.045 --> 34:42.146
[grunting]

34:44.315 --> 34:45.216
[screams]

34:47.819 --> 34:48.653
No!

34:50.955 --> 34:51.956
[Madame Rouge yells]

34:52.056 --> 34:53.324
[all groan]

34:55.393 --> 34:56.594
[grunts]

34:57.595 --> 34:58.763
[Cliff groans]

35:03.434 --> 35:05.803
[groaning]

35:07.972 --> 35:11.109
Oh, no. No, no, no.

35:15.580 --> 35:17.115
[all screaming]

35:17.181 --> 35:18.583
What the hell is
going on up there?

35:19.317 --> 35:20.751
We're under attack.

35:22.186 --> 35:23.087
[screams] Fuck!

35:24.822 --> 35:25.957
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

35:28.326 --> 35:29.260
Come on!

35:40.872 --> 35:43.508
Don't even try it, girlie.

35:43.608 --> 35:45.543
You've got a real family
to worry about.

35:51.849 --> 35:53.317
[mechanical beeping]

35:53.384 --> 35:54.519
[screams] No!

35:54.619 --> 35:55.887
[breathing heavily] What?

35:55.987 --> 35:57.788
What just happened?

35:57.855 --> 35:59.190
Clara, listen to me.

35:59.290 --> 36:01.359
Everything is going
to be all right.

36:01.459 --> 36:03.628
[baby crying]

36:04.529 --> 36:05.796
Go.

36:05.863 --> 36:07.165
We'll take care of this.

36:08.699 --> 36:11.536
Just get him back safe.

36:11.636 --> 36:13.237
We will, I promise.

36:13.337 --> 36:14.205
All right.

36:16.807 --> 36:18.543
Okay.

36:18.643 --> 36:21.045
Now, I know we've all
had our fair share
of hemming and hawing,

36:21.145 --> 36:22.480
but enough is enough.

36:22.547 --> 36:23.648
Cliff's been kidnapped.

36:23.714 --> 36:24.916
We have to act fast.

36:25.016 --> 36:26.350
Victor, we need to find out

36:26.417 --> 36:28.219
where the Brotherhood of Evil
is hiding.

36:28.319 --> 36:29.187
On it.

36:29.253 --> 36:31.189
Grid, send me a lo-- [sighs]

36:32.156 --> 36:33.491
I'll get my laptop.

36:33.558 --> 36:35.693
[Rita] Uh, Larry,
go start the bus.

36:36.661 --> 36:37.828
Quickly, Larry!

36:37.895 --> 36:39.397
Yeah, the larva's fine,
by the way.

36:39.497 --> 36:40.598
Thanks for checking

36:40.698 --> 36:42.066
-[parasite growls]
-[Larry groans]

36:43.167 --> 36:44.769
There is no choice now.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.737
We have to destroy
the Brotherhood.

36:46.837 --> 36:47.838
You ready?

36:48.773 --> 36:49.874
I don't know.

36:49.941 --> 36:51.442
The underground
is falling apart.

36:51.542 --> 36:52.910
The personas are gone.

36:53.010 --> 36:55.680
And I could swear
I heard something down there

36:55.746 --> 36:57.248
and something is in pain.

36:57.348 --> 36:59.584
Don't do this.

36:59.684 --> 37:01.786
Every time things
get bad for us,

37:01.886 --> 37:03.554
you get lost in your own head.

37:03.621 --> 37:05.289
You can't sleep through
another crisis, Jane.

37:05.389 --> 37:07.592
-Not again.
-What the fuck do you
want me to do?

37:10.094 --> 37:12.863
I don't have powers, remember?

37:12.930 --> 37:14.265
I'm not the help
you're looking for.

37:14.365 --> 37:16.634
None of you are the help
I'm looking for.

37:16.734 --> 37:20.771
In fact, the most capable
person left in this house
is probably Cliff's daughter,

37:20.871 --> 37:23.241
but she is not like us.

37:23.975 --> 37:25.409
No one is.

37:25.476 --> 37:27.478
This isn't about us anymore.

37:27.578 --> 37:29.380
This is about Cliff.

37:29.447 --> 37:31.649
-Speak.
-They're in Florida.

37:31.749 --> 37:33.918
If we drive all night,
we can make it by tomorrow.

37:35.052 --> 37:36.487
Ready?

37:36.587 --> 37:38.823
[breathing heavily]

37:38.923 --> 37:40.091
All right.

37:45.763 --> 37:48.899
[Cliff moans]

37:48.966 --> 37:51.636
Oh, what the fuck
just happened?

37:51.736 --> 37:54.238
Where am I?
Are Clara and Rory safe?

37:54.305 --> 37:58.175
I have no idea
who you're talking about,
and I don't care.

37:58.276 --> 38:00.978
Welcome to the Sunshine State,
Cliff Steele.

38:01.078 --> 38:03.447
Am I back in fucking Florida?

38:03.514 --> 38:05.616
I just fucking left Florida.

38:05.683 --> 38:07.151
Fuck me!

38:07.251 --> 38:08.819
Who the fuck are you?

38:08.919 --> 38:11.822
Shit. Duh.
You're the fucking Brain.

38:11.922 --> 38:14.358
Yes, I am the fucking Brain.

38:14.458 --> 38:16.360
And you are the Robotman.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.996
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Big fan.

38:19.096 --> 38:22.366
Not of you, per se,
but of your design.

38:23.134 --> 38:24.435
[Cliff] Oh, yeah?

38:24.502 --> 38:26.937
So you must also be a fan
of things like skin tags,

38:27.004 --> 38:30.608
acapella music,
the 1973 Houston Oilers--

38:30.675 --> 38:32.510
[The Brain] You really have
no appreciation

38:32.610 --> 38:34.879
for the miracle
that you are, do you?

38:34.979 --> 38:39.216
I spent my entire life
trying to design a body
like yours.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.786
I was furious
when Niles Caulder,

38:41.852 --> 38:44.221
my hated rival,
did what I could not.

38:44.322 --> 38:47.958
So when I saw your blueprints
auction online, I had to bid.

38:48.025 --> 38:49.560
You bought my blueprints?

38:49.660 --> 38:51.662
I had to know how Niles did it.

38:51.729 --> 38:53.664
He was never
a brilliant scientist,

38:53.731 --> 38:54.865
but that was the catch.

38:54.965 --> 38:58.402
Niles dabbled in science
and magic.

38:58.502 --> 39:00.371
Your body is special, Cliff.

39:00.471 --> 39:02.807
It's infused with
magical properties.

39:02.873 --> 39:04.575
What the fuck are you saying?

39:04.675 --> 39:08.913
You are one of a kind,
and that simply isn't fair.

39:09.013 --> 39:12.550
A body like yours should
belong to someone worthy,

39:12.650 --> 39:14.218
someone like me.

39:14.318 --> 39:15.553
Once I take it from you,

39:15.653 --> 39:18.723
I'll finally be able
to take my revenge.

39:18.823 --> 39:21.092
[chuckling] Revenge?

39:21.192 --> 39:22.860
How's that gonna work?

39:22.927 --> 39:24.428
[Madame Rouge]
Here's what I'm thinking.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.564
[slurping]

39:26.664 --> 39:31.736
After we replace your brain
with The Brain,

39:31.836 --> 39:34.538
we'll return home
to your friends,

39:34.605 --> 39:36.407
your foolish friends.

39:36.507 --> 39:40.177
And they'll welcome back
Robotman with open arms.

39:40.244 --> 39:42.413
Then disguised together,
The Brain and I

39:42.513 --> 39:47.451
will systematically destroy
your friends one by one
from within,

39:47.551 --> 39:50.054
saving Rita for last,

39:50.121 --> 39:54.725
and then I will just finish her
off once and for all.

39:54.792 --> 39:55.760
[slurps]

39:55.860 --> 39:59.230
Well, you really are evil.

39:59.296 --> 40:00.731
Oh, please.

40:00.798 --> 40:03.701
She doesn't know the
first thing about being evil.

40:03.768 --> 40:04.602
Mallah!

40:04.702 --> 40:05.736
[Mallah growls]

40:06.537 --> 40:07.405
[gasps]

40:08.406 --> 40:09.273
Holy fuck!

40:09.373 --> 40:12.743
-[growls]
-[screams] Fuck!

40:14.278 --> 40:15.246
[Kay]<i> Jane?</i>

40:19.383 --> 40:30.895
Jane.

40:30.961 --> 40:32.897
[distant screaming]

40:41.071 --> 40:45.643
-Faster, Vic. Faster!
-Lady, this is a school bus.

40:45.743 --> 40:49.313
God, sit down, Rita. Ow!

40:49.413 --> 40:50.948
[breathing heavily]

40:51.015 --> 40:53.784
I can't believe you brought
that repulsive thing with you.

40:53.851 --> 40:55.152
[Vic] He's trying
to keep it safe.

40:55.252 --> 40:56.854
That's what fathers
are supposed to do.

40:56.954 --> 40:58.856
You're only sticking up for him
because he's the only one

40:58.956 --> 41:00.958
who was happy about
your cosmetic surgery.

41:01.025 --> 41:02.426
Yeah, well,
no one else was happy.

41:02.493 --> 41:03.794
I never said I was happy.

41:04.762 --> 41:05.529
What?

41:05.629 --> 41:06.864
No. You know what?

41:06.964 --> 41:07.832
I'm not happy.

41:07.932 --> 41:09.333
Hey, Cliff was right.

41:09.433 --> 41:11.335
Why does Vic's fresh start
look like that,

41:11.435 --> 41:13.204
and mine looks like this?

41:13.304 --> 41:16.307
I thought if I could spare
this larva from my pain,

41:16.373 --> 41:17.475
it'd get better.

41:17.541 --> 41:18.843
I thought I'd feel better.

41:18.943 --> 41:20.845
But I'm not the only one
affecting this thing.

41:20.945 --> 41:21.979
It's all of us.

41:22.046 --> 41:23.514
You and you.

41:23.614 --> 41:25.683
You're all so
emotionally toxic.

41:25.783 --> 41:26.817
It's killing us both.

41:26.884 --> 41:28.185
Okay, let me get this straight.

41:29.487 --> 41:31.188
None of you are happy for me?

41:31.288 --> 41:32.556
[Larry] Argh!

41:32.656 --> 41:34.692
I finally get the chance
at a normal life again,

41:34.792 --> 41:37.728
and... y'all are just jealous?

41:37.828 --> 41:40.064
-That's pathetic.
-Can we just chill?

41:40.664 --> 41:41.565
[sighs]

41:41.665 --> 41:43.200
We're all going through shit.

41:43.734 --> 41:44.668
Fuck it.

41:45.569 --> 41:46.737
Deal with it later.

41:46.837 --> 41:48.205
Like Rita said,
this is about Cliff.

41:48.305 --> 41:49.673
Uh... [scoffs] Wait.

41:49.740 --> 41:51.509
Is that what Rita told you?

41:51.575 --> 41:52.510
Please.

41:52.576 --> 41:54.378
This isn't about Cliff at all.

41:58.082 --> 41:59.683
Come on,
tell her the truth, Rita.

42:04.688 --> 42:07.358
-[stretcher whirring]
-[Cliff moans]

42:08.492 --> 42:10.594
[sighs]

42:13.230 --> 42:14.164
Ugh.

42:18.168 --> 42:19.570
[The Brain] Ah, you're awake.

42:21.071 --> 42:23.173
-[both grunting]
-Don't bother attempting
to shapeshift.

42:23.240 --> 42:26.510
Mallah injected you with
a meta-human power dampener.

42:26.577 --> 42:28.045
[Madame Rouge] We had a deal.

42:28.112 --> 42:29.613
I changed my mind.

42:29.713 --> 42:32.416
The Brotherhood of Evil
is old news.

42:32.516 --> 42:35.452
Evil, well,
it's a complicated thing.

42:35.553 --> 42:38.589
Seventy years ago,
I wanted to rule the world.

42:38.689 --> 42:40.090
After Caulder defeated me,

42:40.190 --> 42:42.192
I would have stopped
at nothing to kill him

42:42.259 --> 42:43.727
and erase his legacy.

42:43.794 --> 42:45.095
But now,

42:45.195 --> 42:47.798
now all I want to do
is take this metal body

42:47.898 --> 42:51.268
and live a life of indulgence
in sunny Boca Raton.

42:51.368 --> 42:54.371
Maybe do the foxtrot
with the widow in unit J.

43:01.245 --> 43:03.414
Goodbye, Madame Rouge.

43:03.480 --> 43:04.481
[screams]

43:07.051 --> 43:08.085
Asshole.

43:13.891 --> 43:15.125
[Larry] Tell them, Rita.

43:15.225 --> 43:16.560
Tell them why you're really
after Rouge.

43:16.627 --> 43:20.331
I told you,
this is about Cliff.

43:20.431 --> 43:21.799
This is about all of us.

43:21.899 --> 43:24.335
If we don't stop Rouge,
she and the Brotherhood

43:24.435 --> 43:26.904
will not stop
until we're all dead.

43:26.971 --> 43:28.572
Uh, you mean dead again?

43:28.639 --> 43:30.074
You had a time machine.

43:30.140 --> 43:31.942
You could have changed
all of this.

43:32.009 --> 43:34.645
But instead,
you went back to Codsville
and locked the door

43:34.745 --> 43:36.747
and made sure everyone died.

43:36.814 --> 43:37.982
[Jane and Vic] Wait, what?

43:39.083 --> 43:40.651
This was never about Cliff.

43:43.821 --> 43:44.688
Larry is right.

43:44.788 --> 43:48.325
I... I'd forgotten you all.

43:48.425 --> 43:51.428
I...I had escaped. [chuckles]

43:51.495 --> 43:52.696
I fell in love.

43:53.597 --> 43:55.699
I had friends.

43:55.799 --> 43:58.802
I had the perfect life
until Rouge.

43:59.837 --> 44:01.338
I could have saved you.

44:01.438 --> 44:04.141
I could have altered
the timeline

44:04.208 --> 44:06.176
and changed everything,

44:06.276 --> 44:10.014
but that would have risked
erasing the life that I had,

44:10.114 --> 44:12.016
and I just couldn't do that.

44:13.784 --> 44:16.353
So now I'm back.

44:16.453 --> 44:19.356
But it doesn't feel like home,
not anymore.

44:19.456 --> 44:21.525
You are strangers to me.

44:23.160 --> 44:25.629
So, when we arrive in Florida,

44:25.696 --> 44:28.365
you can put all your bullshit
aside and rescue Cliff,

44:28.465 --> 44:31.201
or you can sit in this bus
and wallow, I don't care.

44:31.301 --> 44:32.870
All I want is Rouge.

44:35.639 --> 44:37.474
You lied to us the whole time.

44:37.541 --> 44:39.643
You can talk, Larry.
You lied right to my face.

44:39.710 --> 44:41.679
[Larry and Rita]
It isn't about your face, Vic!

44:41.745 --> 44:42.880
Fuck!

44:42.980 --> 44:45.649
[sighs]

44:47.651 --> 44:49.186
[distant screams]

44:57.661 --> 44:59.229
[faint growls]

45:01.198 --> 45:04.435
[screams, growls intensify]

45:07.705 --> 45:09.440
[gasps, breathes heavily]

45:09.540 --> 45:12.776
[indistinct screaming]

45:36.700 --> 45:39.103
["Les Champs Elysees" playing]

46:12.736 --> 46:14.404
