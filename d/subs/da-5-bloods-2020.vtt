Hey, Paul, come inside!

16:38.916 --> 16:39.750
Clear!

16:45.041 --> 16:46.041
Bloods!

16:48.333 --> 16:49.583
[Paul] Yo, come on in here.

17:03.291 --> 17:05.291
All right. Let's see what we got here.

17:12.250 --> 17:14.375
-[Melvin] Out of sight!
-[Paul] Great googly-moogly.

17:14.458 --> 17:15.708
You know what this means?

17:16.500 --> 17:18.000
We gold standard.

17:18.375 --> 17:19.375
[laughs]

17:19.750 --> 17:20.958
We gold standard.

17:23.291 --> 17:26.791
I've run many tours for GIs
from the American War.

17:28.833 --> 17:31.500
Glad you can now see our country
in a different light.

17:33.375 --> 17:37.500
Wow! Will you look at this?

17:37.583 --> 17:40.125
-[Melvin] It's a whole different place.
-I can't believe it.

17:40.208 --> 17:43.125
They didn't need us.
They should've just sent Mickey D's,

17:43.208 --> 17:44.666
Pizza Hut and The Colonel,

17:44.750 --> 17:46.958
and we would have defeated the V.C.
in one week.

17:47.041 --> 17:48.875
-You got it. [chuckles]
-Finger-lickin' good.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.333
Paul, when did you serve?

17:52.458 --> 17:58.458
I did three tours, man.
'67 to '71. 1st Infantry.

17:59.166 --> 18:01.916
Were you involved
in Operation Junction City?

18:02.000 --> 18:04.166
-We were there. We were all there.
-Oh, yeah.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.083
Yeah.

18:05.875 --> 18:07.166
My father was there, too.

18:07.875 --> 18:10.833
-Yeah?
-25th Infantry, ARVN.

18:12.041 --> 18:13.750
He fought to the very last man.

18:14.250 --> 18:16.916
My brother, give it to me. Give it to me.

18:18.916 --> 18:21.625
My family was here in Saigon when it fell.

18:21.708 --> 18:25.666
My dad spent 18 months
in a communist re-education camp.

18:25.750 --> 18:26.583
Wow.

18:27.166 --> 18:28.833
Many other were not so lucky.

18:30.666 --> 18:33.708
Hey, y'all remember
those fugazi  Rambo  movies?

18:33.791 --> 18:34.916
-Sly.
-Yeah.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.583
I like them shits, man.

18:36.666 --> 18:38.541
You gotta be fucking kidding me, man.

18:38.625 --> 18:42.458
Him and that... that dude, uh,
Walker, Texas Ranger.

18:42.541 --> 18:44.250
-I ain't saying nothing about him.
-Man!

18:44.333 --> 18:47.916
Out there trying to save
some imaginary POWs.

18:48.000 --> 18:51.875
All them Holly-weird motherfuckers
trying to go back and win the Vietnam War.

18:51.958 --> 18:56.708
Yeah. I would be the first cat in line
if there was a flick about a real hero,

18:56.791 --> 18:59.875
you know, one of our blood.
Somebody like Milton Olive.

18:59.958 --> 19:03.291
[Eddie]  That man jumped on that grenade
and saved his Bloods' lives.

19:03.375 --> 19:07.250
[Otis]  And he was the first brother
to be awarded the Medal of Honor in Nam.

19:07.333 --> 19:08.625
Eighteen years old.

19:08.708 --> 19:13.166
Look, I love y'all and all that bullshit,
but, uh, I ain't doin' that.

19:13.250 --> 19:15.500
Man, nobody want you to die for them.

19:15.583 --> 19:16.791
'Cause I ain't.

19:17.291 --> 19:19.708
Like Aretha sang, "You better think."

19:19.791 --> 19:21.750
-Oh, Vinh.
-What the fuck he talkin' about?

19:21.833 --> 19:25.500
Listen, Bloods, I'm out, all right?
Thank you very much.

19:25.583 --> 19:26.708
-Thank you.
-All right.

19:26.791 --> 19:29.458
-Oh. Oh, oh. Be careful, man.
-Yeah?

19:30.291 --> 19:32.416
I'll be careful. Later.

19:32.958 --> 19:34.083
Where's he going?

19:34.958 --> 19:37.041
[Paul]  He got something
to take care of, man.

19:47.291 --> 19:48.833
[footsteps approaching]

19:56.875 --> 19:57.875
Tiên...

20:00.041 --> 20:01.625
you have hardly changed.

20:01.708 --> 20:07.291
We both know that's not true.
But thank you for being so kind.

20:11.958 --> 20:13.833
You look like
you've done well for yourself.

20:14.416 --> 20:15.833
We find a way.

20:17.250 --> 20:21.541
-Yes, we do. When we can.
-Yes.

20:22.250 --> 20:24.166
[in Vietnamese]

20:26.291 --> 20:27.500
[Otis chuckles]

20:28.875 --> 20:30.958
[in English] The gold is belong
to Vietnamese government.

20:31.916 --> 20:35.166
Monsieur Desroche converts the gold
into cash.

20:36.125 --> 20:40.375
He's the only person that I know
who can handle a transaction of this size.

20:42.333 --> 20:45.083
-Have you dealt with him before?
-Yes.

20:46.083 --> 20:48.958
He's expensive. 20%.

20:50.083 --> 20:52.208
-[sighs]
-And I will need 10%.

20:52.291 --> 20:54.625
And there's no other way to move this?

20:55.458 --> 20:56.291
[door opens]

20:56.375 --> 20:59.166
-International export is my business.
-[door closes]

20:59.250 --> 21:01.791
-It's why you call me.
-Yeah.

21:02.666 --> 21:04.375
[woman in Vietnamese]

21:13.041 --> 21:16.250
[in English] This is my daughter, Michon.

21:18.583 --> 21:23.375
And this is my old friend Otis.
From American War.

21:24.250 --> 21:26.375
-[Otis whispers] It's, uh...
-Hello, Otis.

21:28.875 --> 21:30.375
It's very nice to meet you.

21:31.083 --> 21:32.375
[in Vietnamese]

21:33.000 --> 21:34.333
[in English] Thanks, my dear.

21:53.541 --> 21:54.541
[sighs]

22:13.916 --> 22:14.875
Is, uh...

22:20.166 --> 22:25.208
Is, uh... Is that our daughter? Our...

22:26.250 --> 22:28.333
Yes, she is.

22:31.166 --> 22:34.541
She was a bastard child of the enemy.

22:36.625 --> 22:38.208
I was a whore.

22:38.791 --> 22:42.541
Her father was a  moi,  the nigger.

22:45.333 --> 22:47.916
The white GI taught us that word.

22:48.833 --> 22:50.458
Everyone want us out.

22:51.583 --> 22:55.500
We was too dirty to even clean the toilet.

22:57.791 --> 23:01.500
They call our beautiful Michon
the cockroach.

23:07.208 --> 23:09.166
-Mmm?
-No.

23:19.458 --> 23:20.750
Good night, Tiên.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.416
Good night, Otis.

23:27.708 --> 23:29.291
[Michon in Vietnamese]

24:12.916 --> 24:14.375
[bell tolling]

24:24.125 --> 24:27.291
[in English] May I ask, how did they
end up in your possession?

24:27.375 --> 24:29.750
You ask a lotta goddamn questions,
wringer.

24:32.166 --> 24:36.333
Monsieur, maybe they're from a bank
you just knocked off in Manila.

24:36.416 --> 24:39.125
Or maybe the authorities
are looking for them.

24:39.208 --> 24:41.125
I don't need that kind of shit.

24:41.208 --> 24:43.583
We ain't no international criminals,
you dig?

24:43.666 --> 24:47.375
In my line of work,
I have to be very careful,

24:47.458 --> 24:51.458
and that means knowing exactly
who I am in business with.

24:51.541 --> 24:53.958
This cat getting on
my last goddamn nerve, man.

24:54.541 --> 24:57.208
Gentlemen, I believe
our business is finished.

24:57.291 --> 24:58.458
[Paul] Hey, wait a minute.

24:59.250 --> 25:02.083
Do me a favor. Sit down, please?
Just give us that respect.

25:04.000 --> 25:06.041
Where were Frenchies in World War II?

25:07.875 --> 25:10.083
Hitler had y'all by the snails.

25:11.083 --> 25:14.166
The goddamn US of A saved your asses.

25:14.250 --> 25:16.958
If it wasn't for good ol' Uncle Sam,
all of yous,

25:17.041 --> 25:20.750
y'all be speaking the  deutsche
eating bratwurst,

25:20.833 --> 25:26.541
schnitzels and sauerkraut instead
of croissants, snails and escargot.

25:26.625 --> 25:27.791
Come on, Blood. Let it go.

25:27.875 --> 25:29.458
-No, man, no.
-Just let it go!

25:29.541 --> 25:32.166
No, fuck that. I ain't done.

25:34.750 --> 25:37.500
This motherfucker can't tell me shit.

25:38.208 --> 25:40.750
My daddy, God rest his soul,

25:40.833 --> 25:45.041
landed in Normandy and killed  beaucoup
goose-stepping Nazis.

25:45.125 --> 25:49.541
Let me tell you something, them Nazis
weren't no punks neither. Not like you.

25:54.291 --> 25:56.875
-Yeah, okay, I'm done.
-You feel better?

25:56.958 --> 25:58.416
-Yeah.
-[Desroche] Well,

25:59.000 --> 26:04.666
I thank you for this ignorant American
one-sided version of World War II.

26:04.750 --> 26:08.583
Please understand. He taking big risk.

26:08.666 --> 26:09.916
And we ain't?

26:11.041 --> 26:15.250
DaRoach, we gotta trust you,
and you gotta trust us.

26:17.166 --> 26:18.416
[Otis] Mr. Desroche...

26:20.666 --> 26:24.375
Our platoon was ordered
to find a C-47 CIA plane

26:24.458 --> 26:28.166
that went down with a payroll
for the native people. The Lahu.

26:28.250 --> 26:30.958
Now, they didn't wanna be paid
in paper currency,

26:31.041 --> 26:35.250
so Uncle Sam was paying them in gold bars
for their help against the V.C.

26:35.958 --> 26:38.208
Well, we found the gold, and we...

26:38.291 --> 26:43.125
We bury it. For now.
They ask, we say the V.C. got it.

26:43.958 --> 26:46.791
Later on, we come back and collect.

26:46.875 --> 26:48.208
You mean rip it off.

26:48.291 --> 26:50.000
We ain't ripping off shit!

26:51.250 --> 26:53.416
Who feel like
they're ripping something off?

26:54.416 --> 26:57.708
We was the very first people
that died for this red, white and blue.

26:58.666 --> 26:59.833
Yeah, that's right.

27:00.708 --> 27:04.875
It was a soul brother, Crispus Attucks
at the motherfuckin' Boston Massacre.

27:05.708 --> 27:08.458
We been dying for this country
from the very get,

27:08.541 --> 27:11.041
hoping one day they'd give us
our rightful place.

27:11.125 --> 27:14.416
All they give us was a foot
up our black asses. Well, fuck that.

27:15.125 --> 27:20.000
I say the USA owe us. We built this bitch!

27:20.708 --> 27:22.208
So, what you sayin', Blood?

27:24.125 --> 27:27.750
I'm saying... we repossess this gold...

27:29.125 --> 27:32.666
like they about to come repossess
your cash yield convertible now.

27:32.750 --> 27:34.166
[all laughing]

27:36.666 --> 27:41.541
We repossess this gold for every single
black boot that never made it home.

27:42.333 --> 27:46.416
Every brother and sister stolen
from Mother Africa to Jamestown, Virginia

27:46.500 --> 27:48.791
way back in 1619.

27:51.083 --> 27:54.166
We give this gold to our people.

27:55.291 --> 27:58.375
You feel that? You feel it?

28:00.458 --> 28:03.125
-Now, let's bury our gold.
-[Paul] Reparations.

28:03.208 --> 28:05.208
-[glasses clink]
-[Norman] Bloods.

28:05.291 --> 28:06.708
-[gunshot echoes]
-[all]  Bloods.

28:06.791 --> 28:08.666
[distant gunfire]

28:11.000 --> 28:13.958
We went back a few weeks later,
but the area was napalmed,

28:14.041 --> 28:16.333
and we lost all of our landmarks.

28:16.416 --> 28:22.625
But recently, a mudslide has exposed
what might be the C-47's tail,

28:23.291 --> 28:26.375
and satellite pictures
have pinpointed the spot.

28:26.458 --> 28:29.958
Mmm. You're more informed
than your friend here.

28:30.041 --> 28:32.791
Sir, are you in or out?

28:47.500 --> 28:53.416
This is my last offer per kilo,
less my commission.

29:03.833 --> 29:04.875
Tiên said 20.

29:04.958 --> 29:09.208
One cannot carry millions of dollars
through US Customs.

29:09.708 --> 29:13.125
The extra two points will get you
a dummy corporation

29:13.208 --> 29:16.708
and a tax-free offshore account in Macau.

29:17.291 --> 29:21.083
You can then withdraw the funds
from any bank in the world.

29:21.166 --> 29:23.708
How do I know that you two
ain't a con artist team?

29:24.500 --> 29:28.250
As you said, you simply must trust us.

29:28.333 --> 29:32.458
Yeah, well, the extra 2%
comes outta her cut.

29:33.458 --> 29:34.291
That's right.

29:37.333 --> 29:39.500
-I'll cover it.
-Price of doing business.

29:40.416 --> 29:42.666
-So, we good?
-Yeah.

29:44.041 --> 29:45.958
-I'm good.
-Yeah, I'm good.

29:46.708 --> 29:52.125
And, sir, Uncle Sam did no better
than France in Vietnam.

29:53.958 --> 29:57.625
Gentlemen, I look forward
to seeing you again in a few days.

29:57.708 --> 29:59.125
If you will excuse me,

29:59.208 --> 30:02.083
I have a lot of things to do
for all of us.

30:02.916 --> 30:04.000
[in French]

30:05.750 --> 30:06.791
[in English] And, uh...

30:07.291 --> 30:08.416
vive la France.

30:10.041 --> 30:11.708
[in English] This motherfucker, man.

30:12.583 --> 30:13.750
-[door shuts]
-[water running]

30:14.458 --> 30:15.708
[softly] I don't take that.

30:16.791 --> 30:17.875
[water stops running]

30:26.291 --> 30:27.833
What the fuck are you doing here?

30:28.500 --> 30:29.625
I'm worried about you.

30:31.250 --> 30:32.083
Why?

30:33.500 --> 30:36.541
-Well, I found out you were coming here.
-And?

30:37.541 --> 30:39.250
And I came to check on you.

30:41.125 --> 30:44.541
You don't give a flying fuck
about me. [scoffs]

30:44.625 --> 30:47.583
I do. You been acting more crazy
than usual.

30:52.541 --> 30:53.500
Yeah, well...

30:56.041 --> 30:57.458
you consider me checked on.

30:59.208 --> 31:00.583
You're here for the gold.

31:01.375 --> 31:02.208
Don't lie.

31:03.458 --> 31:05.875
You're going after the gold.
I read Otis' emails.

31:07.125 --> 31:11.416

31:12.375 --> 31:14.416
[laughs] Come on now, Dad.

31:15.083 --> 31:16.416
What do you want, David?

31:17.000 --> 31:19.583
-An equal share for helping you find it.
-Hell to the naw!

31:19.666 --> 31:23.166
The authorities find out about this,
y'all go back to the crib empty-handed.

31:23.916 --> 31:27.458
So, you just a lil' jive-ass
gangster now, huh?

31:27.541 --> 31:31.791
After everything you've put me through,
I'd say you getting a basement bargain.

31:33.000 --> 31:38.041
You ungrateful lil'...
lil' Black Studies teacher nigga.

31:40.333 --> 31:42.875
You want to tell your Bloods or should I?

31:49.958 --> 31:51.875
[Eddie] You sure know
how to raise 'em, don't you?

31:51.958 --> 31:55.541
What happens if we bum-rush your boy
and throw his ass off that balcony?

31:55.625 --> 31:57.500
Know I'm taking
a couple of you OGs with me.

31:57.583 --> 32:00.083
-Don't ever threaten my son, man.
-Or what?

32:00.166 --> 32:02.291
Or you will nab more trouble
than you know what to do with.

32:02.375 --> 32:03.625
-Oh, come on!
-Come on!

32:03.708 --> 32:05.166
Cool it, God damn it! Cool it!

32:06.958 --> 32:08.541
David, you are not getting a full share.

32:08.625 --> 32:11.041
-You and your daddy can split a share.
-You can forget that.

32:11.125 --> 32:12.333
You take it or leave it.

32:15.458 --> 32:16.625
[sighs]

32:17.833 --> 32:19.541
You see what you made me do, man?

32:20.458 --> 32:21.791
Let me tell you somethin'.

32:22.375 --> 32:25.625
You ain't been nothin'
but an anchor around my neck

32:25.708 --> 32:27.375
since the day you were born.

32:28.416 --> 32:33.083
Yeah, I said it, and I mean it, too.
Take this shit.

32:35.625 --> 32:36.708

32:41.125 --> 32:43.166
David, you're a buck private
in this outfit.

32:43.250 --> 32:47.833
You do what we say when we say it.
No questions asked. Understood?

32:49.375 --> 32:51.333
Overstood, Godfather.

33:00.875 --> 33:04.958
-I have bad feeling about this, Otis.
-I'm gonna be all right.

33:05.541 --> 33:10.833
Gold does strange things to people.
Even old friends. Be safe.

33:22.125 --> 33:24.083
All right. Yeah.

33:25.916 --> 33:27.750
I just hope I don't have to use it.

33:34.500 --> 33:36.208
I'll see you in a bit, all right?

35:40.083 --> 35:42.000
-David.
-Yeah?

35:42.083 --> 35:43.625
Why did you come here?

35:46.958 --> 35:48.333
Well, he's my dad.

35:51.291 --> 35:53.041
Feels like my last chance with him.

35:56.333 --> 35:58.875
-He needs counseling.
-I know.

35:59.958 --> 36:02.208
-Talks to himself.

36:05.291 --> 36:08.000
Your pops was never the same

36:09.750 --> 36:10.750
[Otis] Hmm.

36:11.833 --> 36:15.458
-You know, he calls his name in his sleep.
-I can believe that.

36:17.791 --> 36:20.125
-Who was that guy?
-Norm?

36:21.958 --> 36:25.166
That brother was the best damn soldier
that ever lived.

-[gun cocks]

36:47.875 --> 36:50.083
[Otis]  Wasn't many brothers
who made squad leader.

36:51.166 --> 36:53.375
The man was using Bloods
for cannon fodder.

36:54.083 --> 36:56.916
White boys who stayed in college,
they'd dodge that shit.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.291
They put our poor black asses

37:00.375 --> 37:02.083
killing us off like flies.

37:06.916 --> 37:11.458
Stormin' earned his name,

37:12.083 --> 37:13.916
Trained us in the way of the jungle.

I see cops patrolling my neighborhood
like it's some police state.

I can feel just how much I ain't worth.

38:50.375 --> 38:52.750
-[slide projector clicks]
-[Otis]  Gave us something to believe in.

38:53.333 --> 38:55.375
A direction, a purpose.

38:56.541 --> 38:59.750
He taught us about black history
when it wasn't really popular back then.

39:01.041 --> 39:04.541
Schooled us about drinking that
anti-commie Kool-Aid they was selling.

39:05.333 --> 39:08.250
Yeah, he was our Malcolm and our Martin.

39:09.291 --> 39:11.916
Norm had a way of keeping us
from going off.

39:12.750 --> 39:14.000
He wasn't no Tom.

39:15.250 --> 39:18.166

Black GI,

39:43.625 --> 39:49.583
in Memphis, Tennessee, a white man
assassinate Dr. Martin Luther King...

39:50.708 --> 39:53.875
who heroically opposed the cruel

39:53.958 --> 39:57.458
-racial discrimination in the USA.
-[single gunshot]

39:58.166 --> 40:02.791
Dr. King also opposed
the US war in Vietnam.

40:04.541 --> 40:10.291
Black GI, your government
sent 600,000 troops

40:10.375 --> 40:11.916
to crush the rebellion.

40:12.541 --> 40:19.500
Your soul sister and soul brothers
are enraged in over 122 cities.

40:20.125 --> 40:27.083
They kill them while you fight against us,
so far away from where you are needed.

40:29.250 --> 40:33.916
Black GI, the South Vietnamese people
are resolute

40:34.000 --> 40:37.041
against these fascist acts against Negroes

40:37.541 --> 40:40.250
who struggle for civil rights and freedom.

40:42.750 --> 40:47.916
Negroes are only 11% of the US population,

40:48.500 --> 40:52.208
but among troops here in Vietnam,
you are 32%.

40:54.625 --> 40:59.333
Black GI, is it fair to serve more
than the white Americans

40:59.416 --> 41:00.666
that sent you here?

41:01.166 --> 41:06.416
Nothing is more confuse
than to be ordered into a war to die

41:06.916 --> 41:12.041
or to be maimed for life without
the faintest idea of what's going on.

41:13.416 --> 41:15.791
I dedicate this next record

41:15.875 --> 41:19.625

of the 1st Infantry Divisions.

are burnin' shit down back home, Norm.

41:48.458 --> 41:51.541
I love you, man, but you're wrong.
Dead wrong.

41:51.625 --> 41:56.333
You're talking about Dr. King.
You're talking about a man of peace.

41:56.916 --> 41:58.791
And that's what got Dr. King killed.

41:59.291 --> 42:03.041
I'm as mad as everybody.
All us Bloods got a right to be, but...

42:05.208 --> 42:06.375
we Bloods.

42:07.875 --> 42:11.416
Won't let nobody use our rage against us.
We control our rage.

42:12.416 --> 42:16.041
Now, what y'all are trying to do right now
ain't changing shit.

42:17.458 --> 42:20.000
So, stand down. That's an order.

42:20.083 --> 42:22.166
Nah. Fuck an order, Norm!

42:25.666 --> 42:27.416
You're gonna have to kill me first.

[Otis]  And let me tell you, out of all
of us, your pops was closest to him.

43:40.958 --> 43:43.083
Believed in Norman like a religion.

43:43.583 --> 43:46.166
I don't think he believed
in anything since.

You brothers want anything?

43:51.458 --> 43:52.750

So, how you eat it?

44:21.166 --> 44:22.208
It tastes like chicken.

44:22.291 --> 44:25.125

50:16.166 --> 50:18.125
Must be something powerful,

coming back after all these years
with your father.

50:21.250 --> 50:22.875
-Yeah, it's powerful all right.
-Yeah.

50:24.166 --> 50:25.083
What is your name?

50:25.666 --> 50:30.375
Hedy. Like Hedy Lamarr. No?

50:30.458 --> 50:32.666
Old time Hollywood star.

50:33.875 --> 50:36.375
But, well, my last name is Bouvier, so...

50:37.833 --> 50:38.666
Cool.

It's cool.

Seppo... what do you do?

How does one get involved in
the landmine disposal business? Pray tell.

52:01.833 --> 52:04.500
The Bouviers have a history in Vietnam.

52:06.083 --> 52:09.500
It's strange how a war never ends
for those involved.

52:09.583 --> 52:12.916

all these years later.

52:17.583 --> 52:19.166
Back to your family history.

52:19.666 --> 52:25.000
My family made several fortunes
owning a rubber plantation,

52:25.875 --> 52:30.125
and then they bought up much more of
the rice market and made another fortune.

52:30.208 --> 52:31.750
See, the white gold.

52:33.541 --> 52:34.416
Hmm.

52:36.208 --> 52:37.791
Wonderful family business.

52:38.916 --> 52:42.666
But one exception, we exploited
the shit out of the Vietnamese people.

52:43.500 --> 52:45.625
So, that's the meaning behind the mines.

52:46.291 --> 52:49.041
So, what did the Bouvier family
think about what you do?

52:49.125 --> 52:50.375

52:53.708 --> 52:59.625
I'm the founder and the director of LAMB,

Yeah, LAMB. Love Against Mines and Bombs.

[Paul] Oh, yeah, baby.

1:00:20.250 --> 1:00:21.750
What happens if somebody get heatstroke

1:00:21.833 --> 1:00:23.458
or sprain an ankle or something?

1:00:23.791 --> 1:00:26.291
Otis is a medic. A good one, too.

1:00:26.375 --> 1:00:28.166
Even took a few rounds out of me once.

1:00:28.250 --> 1:00:30.458
From your black monkey ass, as I recall.

1:00:30.541 --> 1:00:32.041
[all laughing]

1:00:33.958 --> 1:00:34.791
What's that?

1:00:35.791 --> 1:00:36.750
Water.

1:00:37.708 --> 1:00:40.416
What? I need to take a breathalyzer test?

1:00:41.791 --> 1:00:44.875
-Well, what are those?
-[Otis] It's something for my hip.

1:00:44.958 --> 1:00:46.625
I know that. But what are they?

1:00:47.791 --> 1:00:48.625
OxyContin.

1:00:49.208 --> 1:00:51.208
[laughs] Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?

1:00:51.291 --> 1:00:54.416
You think I'm sneakin' a drink,
and you on that opioid epidemic shit.

1:00:54.500 --> 1:00:57.166
-It's prescribed.
-Oh, yeah. You writing the prescriptions?

1:00:57.666 --> 1:01:00.583
No, the VA. Just like everybody else.

1:01:00.666 --> 1:01:02.291
You best be careful with that shit.

1:01:02.375 --> 1:01:05.083
-What is this, an intervention?
-You need one?

1:01:07.583 --> 1:01:10.375
Y'all think I'm a junkie? Hmm?

1:01:13.833 --> 1:01:14.833
Oh, shit.

1:01:15.791 --> 1:01:17.916
There. I don't need this shit.

1:01:47.458 --> 1:01:48.291
This way.

1:01:56.750 --> 1:01:58.250
[Otis in Vietnamese]

1:02:00.583 --> 1:02:02.166
[boy speaking]

1:02:09.041 --> 1:02:10.083
[Paul in English] Let's go.

1:02:12.958 --> 1:02:13.958
[camera shutter clicks]

1:02:14.916 --> 1:02:16.083
[buffalo grunts]

1:02:16.916 --> 1:02:18.083
[snoring]

1:02:21.250 --> 1:02:22.500
[Melvin] You know he hurting.

1:02:24.666 --> 1:02:27.375
[Eddie] Yeah, man.
I hope he's gonna be okay.

1:02:38.625 --> 1:02:40.041
[animals howling]

1:02:40.125 --> 1:02:40.958
[David] Dad!

1:02:42.416 --> 1:02:44.208
-Dad, what the hell is that?
-[shushing]

1:02:44.291 --> 1:02:46.666
-[animals continue howling]
-[leaves rustling]

1:02:48.708 --> 1:02:50.000
[David] Dad! Dad!

1:02:53.500 --> 1:02:54.500
Gibbons.

1:02:56.125 --> 1:02:58.333
I seen a leopard tear one apart once.

1:02:59.166 --> 1:03:00.583
There are leopards out here?

1:03:01.250 --> 1:03:05.000
Leopards are all gone now.
Poachers wiped 'em out.

1:03:05.750 --> 1:03:07.625
-You see that?
-What? What? What?

1:03:07.708 --> 1:03:10.750
Shh! Looked like a man walking out there.

1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:13.708
It was just a flash, but I saw it.

1:03:14.875 --> 1:03:15.875
[shushing]

1:03:15.958 --> 1:03:19.208
-Maybe-- Maybe it was a monkey.
-No goddamn monkey.

1:03:26.166 --> 1:03:27.666
[David] Hey, you see something?

1:03:29.875 --> 1:03:33.166
[whispers] Clear. Clear.

1:03:38.291 --> 1:03:39.916
Oh, my God.

1:03:47.791 --> 1:03:52.083
I'm sorry about being on edge,
you know. Being back here...

1:03:55.500 --> 1:03:57.083
it is not easy.

1:03:59.791 --> 1:04:00.833
It's cool.

1:04:03.583 --> 1:04:06.125
I don't like the way you did it,
but I'm glad you're here.

1:04:10.833 --> 1:04:12.416
Your daddy loves you, you know.

1:04:14.333 --> 1:04:15.500
You know that, right?

1:04:17.500 --> 1:04:20.416
-You've got a funny way of showing it.
-Yeah.

1:04:21.000 --> 1:04:22.541
But I do. I know it.

1:04:25.166 --> 1:04:26.375
I love you back.

1:04:27.958 --> 1:04:31.083
-[mosquito buzzing]
-[grunts]

1:04:31.750 --> 1:04:33.250
[buzzing continues]

1:04:33.333 --> 1:04:38.125
Damn! Who got the bug spray?
Bugs out here eating my ass up.

1:04:40.083 --> 1:04:41.416
Otis had it last.

1:04:42.250 --> 1:04:45.416
[Melvin] Well, can you walk your big
pigeon-toed ass over there and get it?

1:04:46.333 --> 1:04:48.000
What's wrong with your big lumbering ass?

1:04:48.083 --> 1:04:49.833
Man, you sitting right there.

1:04:49.916 --> 1:04:51.833
-[Paul] Oh, shit.
-You sitting right next to the bug spray.

1:04:51.916 --> 1:04:54.166
I gotta get up from my rock,
walk over there and get it.

1:04:54.250 --> 1:04:55.791
You're one lazy-ass motherfucker.

1:04:55.875 --> 1:05:00.083
[Melvin] You a Thanksgiving jive
turkey giblet sorry-ass motherfucker.

1:05:00.166 --> 1:05:02.583
-[David] Shut up. He's trying to sleep.
-[Melvin] We up, he should be up.

1:05:02.666 --> 1:05:05.000
[Eddie] Every time,
you want me to get the shit.

1:05:05.083 --> 1:05:07.416
You can't get up and do it your damn self.

1:05:07.500 --> 1:05:10.333
[Melvin] I got to get up off my damn rock
and walk over there and get it.

1:05:10.416 --> 1:05:16.791
You sitting right there. You get it?
You see it? Big paddle ass. God damn.

1:05:16.875 --> 1:05:17.875
Hey, Paul.

1:05:34.708 --> 1:05:36.250
Ain't this a bitch?

1:05:41.625 --> 1:05:42.833
Nigga, get up.

1:05:42.916 --> 1:05:44.333
-[Otis] What?
-[Paul] Get up, nigga.

1:05:45.916 --> 1:05:47.250
Why you ain't tell us, man?

1:05:47.333 --> 1:05:48.708
-[Otis] What?
-What?

1:05:49.666 --> 1:05:52.041
No wonder he wanted to make
all the arrangements.

1:05:52.125 --> 1:05:54.416
-Tiên give this to you?
-So, what about it?

1:05:54.500 --> 1:05:55.791
[Paul] We should all be packin', you--

1:05:55.875 --> 1:05:57.208
-[Melvin] No.
-[David] Get the gun!

1:05:57.291 --> 1:05:58.958
-[Eddie] Come on, man!
-[Paul] You motherfucker!

1:05:59.041 --> 1:06:01.333
-[Otis] Come on. Beat his ass down, now.
-[David] Shit.

1:06:02.833 --> 1:06:03.666
You all right?

1:06:03.750 --> 1:06:05.875
You a pussy-whipped motherfucker,
ain't you?

1:06:05.958 --> 1:06:07.666
Man, you don't see who she is?

1:06:08.666 --> 1:06:10.541
And that French fuck, Desroche.

1:06:10.625 --> 1:06:13.125
I don't know Desroche
from Adam's house cat,

1:06:14.125 --> 1:06:16.583
but if Tiên vouched for him,
that's good enough for me.

1:06:17.125 --> 1:06:20.541
She's a Soul Alley ho, remember that.

1:06:21.125 --> 1:06:23.625
You know, Paul, you better check yourself.

1:06:23.708 --> 1:06:27.250
I know your mama-san's slanted pussy
strung you out.

1:06:27.333 --> 1:06:29.041
She's still a fucking ho!

1:06:31.458 --> 1:06:32.458
[David] Whoa, whoa, man!

1:06:32.541 --> 1:06:35.833
Get your motherfucking hands off me!
I'll kill you!

1:06:36.500 --> 1:06:38.416
-I'll kill that motherfucker.
-Chill! Chill! Chill!

1:06:38.500 --> 1:06:40.416
Chill! What the fuck's wrong with you?

1:06:41.750 --> 1:06:42.666
Breathe, man!

1:06:42.750 --> 1:06:45.625
[Otis] Come on. Give it to him.

1:06:46.833 --> 1:06:48.166
Go ahead, give it to him.

1:06:51.500 --> 1:06:53.166
Take it. I'm through with it.

1:06:55.291 --> 1:06:56.166
Here.

1:06:57.916 --> 1:06:58.750
Happy?

1:07:04.958 --> 1:07:06.916
[Otis] Man, we're walking
right on top of it.

1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:10.250
[Melvin] You said that on the last hill.
Perspective's totally different.

1:07:10.333 --> 1:07:11.875
[Otis] No, it's gotta be here.

1:07:11.958 --> 1:07:14.916
[Eddie] God damn! We're fucking lost!

1:07:15.708 --> 1:07:18.375
-[Paul] Otis and Eddie think they slick.
-[Otis] What?

1:07:18.458 --> 1:07:21.708
[Paul] Marching us around and around
in circles so we give up and go home.

1:07:22.208 --> 1:07:24.750
You come back,
you collect it all for yourself, huh?

1:07:24.833 --> 1:07:27.875
Then why'd I follow your sorry ass
out here in the first place?

1:07:27.958 --> 1:07:30.541
'Cause you couldn't afford
the airfare, the gear, hotel.

1:07:31.416 --> 1:07:34.458
[chuckles] You needed
Banker Drysdale right there. Uh-huh.

1:07:34.541 --> 1:07:35.375
Shut up!

1:07:37.458 --> 1:07:39.125
You and Tiên are up to something.

1:07:40.333 --> 1:07:42.666
Let me tell you something, Otis,
all y'all.

1:07:44.666 --> 1:07:49.375
I don't need this shit. You got me?
I'm here for Norm.

1:07:50.333 --> 1:07:54.583
I'm here for Norm.
I ain't going for no okey-doke bullshit.

1:07:55.500 --> 1:07:58.958
Dope fiend double-cross, hell no.
Fuck that.

1:08:01.833 --> 1:08:03.416
Where you going, boy?

1:08:03.500 --> 1:08:05.708
I'mma go down to the bank
and make a deposit.

1:08:06.208 --> 1:08:09.125
-Go on, son. Handle your business.
-[Otis] Let me see that GPS.

1:08:13.333 --> 1:08:14.833
This don't make no damn sense.

1:08:18.583 --> 1:08:20.041
Shit, man. Come on.

1:08:47.791 --> 1:08:48.833
[metallic clinking]

1:08:55.833 --> 1:08:59.333
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1:09:00.291 --> 1:09:03.041
-Hey, Dad! Hey, guys!
-[Otis] What?

1:09:03.125 --> 1:09:04.791
I think I found something!

1:09:04.875 --> 1:09:06.416
-Gold! Gold!
-[overlapping] Oh, shit.

1:09:06.500 --> 1:09:07.666
[David] Quick, bring a shovel!

1:09:07.750 --> 1:09:12.291
I think I found the gold!
Gold! Dad! Dad, I found it!

1:09:12.375 --> 1:09:14.416
-[Otis] I hope he really found that shit.
-[David] Gold!

1:09:14.500 --> 1:09:15.708
[Paul] Where you at, son?

1:09:15.791 --> 1:09:16.625
Watch your step.

1:09:16.708 --> 1:09:18.166
[David] Shit, get your shovels!

1:09:18.833 --> 1:09:24.500
Bring your shovels! Bring the shovels!
I found it! I found it! I found it!

1:09:25.833 --> 1:09:27.208
[exclaims]

1:09:27.958 --> 1:09:29.750
-[Paul] Watch your step over there.
-[Otis] Right.

1:09:29.833 --> 1:09:31.041
[David yells]

1:09:35.166 --> 1:09:36.625
Holy shit!

1:09:38.000 --> 1:09:40.750
-[David] That's it, ain't it?
-That's it.

1:09:42.583 --> 1:09:43.416
Holy...

1:09:46.000 --> 1:09:49.625
-God damn! Oh, man!
-[all laughing]

1:09:49.708 --> 1:09:51.208

-Yeah, that's it.

1:09:51.291 --> 1:09:53.041
Oh, shit. [laughing]

1:09:59.958 --> 1:10:00.875
Damn!

1:10:01.916 --> 1:10:03.083
[David exclaims]

1:10:04.541 --> 1:10:06.916
Check your map. Check your map.
Check your map.

1:10:08.708 --> 1:10:10.291
We're in the right coordinates.

1:10:13.291 --> 1:10:15.333
-Yeah. Yeah.
-[Eddie] Hey, y'all.

1:10:16.041 --> 1:10:19.583
Hallowed ground, Bloods. Holy ground.

1:10:19.666 --> 1:10:21.583
[laughing]

1:10:21.666 --> 1:10:24.416
[David] Yeah, that's it, right?
That's it. [exclaims]

1:10:24.500 --> 1:10:25.541
Yeah, that's it.

1:10:25.625 --> 1:10:26.791
-[Otis] Oh, Lord.
-Yeah, that's it.

1:10:26.875 --> 1:10:28.750
-[Otis] Thank you, Lord.
-Yeah, that's it!

-Let me get a picture.
-[exclaiming]

1:10:37.291 --> 1:10:39.250
No! No evidence, man. No evidence.

1:10:39.333 --> 1:10:41.000
-[Melvin] Put that camera down.
-My bad.

1:10:41.083 --> 1:10:42.166
[Paul] Hold that, man.

1:10:44.916 --> 1:10:46.125
[all grunting rhythmically]

1:11:03.625 --> 1:11:05.500
[metal detector beeping rapidly]

1:11:05.583 --> 1:11:10.000
Guys! Guys! I got something!
I got something right here! Right here.

1:11:10.500 --> 1:11:12.000
I'm getting a hit right there.

1:11:14.375 --> 1:11:15.333
-Right here?
-[Paul] Yeah.

1:11:15.416 --> 1:11:16.250
[Eddie] Okay.

1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:22.000
-Yeah, that's something there.
-[Eddie] You in? Oh, shit!

1:11:22.083 --> 1:11:23.333
[Paul] That's it right there.

1:11:24.750 --> 1:11:26.083
[Eddie] This the spot, right here?

1:11:26.583 --> 1:11:28.875
-Wait, I see something here.
-[Paul] Watch your fingers.

1:11:28.958 --> 1:11:31.875
-Otis, it's right there.
-[Otis] Mind your hand. Look out.

1:11:31.958 --> 1:11:32.958
Look out for your hands.

1:11:36.208 --> 1:11:38.541
-Let's go. That's a lid!
-[David] I got a handle.

1:11:40.083 --> 1:11:41.458
-Shit!
-[Eddie] What, it just come off?

1:11:41.541 --> 1:11:43.750
-[David] Damn handle broke.
-[Otis] Shit. It rusted.

1:11:43.833 --> 1:11:45.583
[Paul] Don't put the dirt back
where I dug it out!

1:11:45.666 --> 1:11:47.791
-[Melvin] Move it out the damn way!
-It's all right.

1:11:49.000 --> 1:11:51.541
[Paul] Here, let's just grab it.
Grab it. It looks like...

1:11:51.625 --> 1:11:53.708
[Eddie] Yeah. Ready? Bring it up!

1:11:53.791 --> 1:11:54.791
[all grunting]

1:12:01.083 --> 1:12:03.166
-Shit.
-Wait, where is it? Where is it?

1:12:03.833 --> 1:12:05.666
-Come on!
-[Paul] You gotta be kidding me.

1:12:05.750 --> 1:12:07.041
Let me tip it.

1:12:08.166 --> 1:12:10.625
Ah! Fuckin' fool's gold.

1:12:10.708 --> 1:12:12.166
[Otis laughing]

1:12:12.250 --> 1:12:14.625
-[metal detector beeping]
-[Otis] Whoo!

1:12:14.708 --> 1:12:16.583
We are some gold-plated fools, y'all.

1:12:17.208 --> 1:12:19.875
We're some gold-plated
motherfucking fools.

1:12:19.958 --> 1:12:22.791
Hey, guys, guys, I got another one!
I got something right here.

1:12:22.875 --> 1:12:23.791
[Otis] Where?

1:12:23.875 --> 1:12:25.083
-Right here.
-I got it!

1:12:25.166 --> 1:12:27.541
-[Melvin] Right there!
-[Otis] I got it! I got it! I got it!

1:12:27.625 --> 1:12:28.541
-[Eddie] Got that one?
-[Otis] Yeah.

1:12:28.625 --> 1:12:29.541
[Eddie] All right, go.

1:12:30.166 --> 1:12:31.458
[metal detector beeping rapidly]

1:12:31.541 --> 1:12:32.875
-I got another one!
-[Eddie] I got it!

1:12:32.958 --> 1:12:34.666
-I got another one right here.
-I'm coming!

1:12:34.750 --> 1:12:36.000
-Right there.
-All right.

1:12:36.083 --> 1:12:37.583
-You good?
-[Paul] I'm good.

1:12:40.541 --> 1:12:42.041
[Otis exclaiming]

1:12:42.166 --> 1:12:44.458
[screaming, laughter]

1:12:47.750 --> 1:12:48.958
[all exclaiming]

1:12:49.041 --> 1:12:50.000
-I got a hit!
-[Eddie] Oh, shit!

1:12:50.083 --> 1:12:51.500
[Melvin]
I'm getting hits everywhere!

1:12:51.583 --> 1:12:53.000
[metal detector continues beeping]

1:12:53.083 --> 1:12:55.291
-Right there. Right there.
-[David] All right. Come on.

1:12:58.583 --> 1:13:01.000
-I'm getting hits all over the damn place.
-[Otis] Oh, shit!

1:13:01.083 --> 1:13:02.125
[Otis laughs]

1:13:03.666 --> 1:13:06.625
[David] All right. Put it in your pocket.
Put it in your pocket.

1:13:08.750 --> 1:13:11.791
-All right, I got three right here.
-[Paul] I got one here.

1:13:13.625 --> 1:13:15.625
[David] Keep digging. Keep digging.

1:13:19.166 --> 1:13:21.916
I'm getting hits all over the mountain!
All over the mountain!

1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:23.208
[all laughing]

1:13:23.291 --> 1:13:25.041
[Paul and David exclaiming rhythmically]

1:13:28.958 --> 1:13:30.125
[Paul] Come on, give me some.

1:13:30.208 --> 1:13:31.375
[both exclaim]

1:13:32.083 --> 1:13:34.375
Come on, baby. [yells]

1:13:34.458 --> 1:13:36.958
Hey, I got one here. I got one here.

1:13:37.041 --> 1:13:39.125
They must've fallen in the mudslide.

1:13:39.208 --> 1:13:41.916
Hey, I got something to tell y'all.

1:13:42.000 --> 1:13:43.041
-What?
-What?

1:13:43.875 --> 1:13:48.625
Holy motherfucking, motherfucking,
mother of gold!

1:13:49.125 --> 1:13:52.000
-Mother of gold, motherfucker!
-[Melvin] Get your ass over here!

1:13:52.083 --> 1:13:53.875
[Eddie] Why don't you start digging,
roody-poo?

1:13:53.958 --> 1:13:57.583
Motherfucker, I don't dig for the gold!
I find the motherfucking gold!

1:13:57.666 --> 1:13:58.875
-Fuck you!
-Silly-ass.

1:13:58.958 --> 1:14:01.916
-[Paul] Watch your fingers.
-[David] Come on! Keep digging!

1:14:04.125 --> 1:14:08.500
Forty-five thousand per bar.
Seventeen million all in.

1:14:09.125 --> 1:14:10.666
[Eddie laughs] Yeah.

1:14:11.416 --> 1:14:13.416
But I'm not leaving here without Norman.

1:14:13.916 --> 1:14:16.750
[Melvin] You think Norman cares
whether you find his remains or not?

1:14:17.333 --> 1:14:20.791
You remember what Norman said.
"That gold should go to our people."

1:14:22.833 --> 1:14:24.875
Whoa, what you trying to say, man?

1:14:25.541 --> 1:14:27.750
That gold should go
towards black liberation.

1:14:27.833 --> 1:14:31.125
[scoffs] Yeah, our black liberation.
You do for self.

1:14:31.750 --> 1:14:34.125
I'm talking about black reparations, man.

1:14:34.208 --> 1:14:35.541
[Melvin] I got mine's.

1:14:36.333 --> 1:14:37.541
What about our people?

1:14:37.625 --> 1:14:39.083
What about my people?

1:14:39.583 --> 1:14:42.958
You do what you want with your share,
and we'll each decide for ourselves.

1:14:43.041 --> 1:14:46.250
-That's what Norman said now.
-Now, see? See? Otis knows.

1:14:46.750 --> 1:14:49.708
Norman wanted that gold
to go towards the cause.

1:14:49.791 --> 1:14:53.916
Yeah, that's easy for you to say, Eddie.
You rich. Money don't mean shit to you.

1:14:54.000 --> 1:14:57.083
-I am not rich.
-Yeah, right. Whatever.

1:14:57.166 --> 1:14:59.291
-I'm not rich!
-[chuckles] Okay.

1:14:59.375 --> 1:15:02.833
-I'm broke, man.
-How the fuck are you broke, Eddie? Huh?

1:15:06.666 --> 1:15:09.500
-I lost it all.
-Oh, he bullshittin'.

1:15:11.000 --> 1:15:12.166
I wish I was, man.

1:15:13.166 --> 1:15:14.291
Spill it.

1:15:16.750 --> 1:15:18.541
Come on, man. Fess up.

1:15:22.416 --> 1:15:27.375
Ex-wives, bad investments, back taxes,

1:15:27.458 --> 1:15:30.958
livin' large, drinking, being stupid.

1:15:31.500 --> 1:15:35.208
-You fuckin' name it, I spent money on it.
-But you paid for all of this shit.

1:15:35.291 --> 1:15:39.333
Yeah, yeah, I paid for all this shit
on a black card that's already overdrawn.

1:15:40.833 --> 1:15:43.750
What about all them car dealerships
with your name on 'em?

1:15:44.750 --> 1:15:45.833
I don't own 'em.

1:15:46.625 --> 1:15:48.958
I mean, my name is good
in the business and all, and...

1:15:49.500 --> 1:15:51.291
dealers choose to use 'em, but...

1:15:51.375 --> 1:15:54.291
they'll pull that shit as soon
as it stops working for 'em.

1:15:54.875 --> 1:15:56.875
I'm telling you,
I ain't got a pot to piss in

1:15:56.958 --> 1:15:59.916
or a window to throw it out of.
And that's facts!

1:16:04.416 --> 1:16:05.375
God damn.

1:16:07.708 --> 1:16:08.708
Sorry, bro.

1:16:11.375 --> 1:16:12.875
Can we just go find Norm?

1:16:15.750 --> 1:16:17.500
Stormin' Norm's been waiting.

1:16:26.875 --> 1:16:27.708
Damn.

1:16:29.375 --> 1:16:30.833
Ain't that some doo-doo.

1:16:42.166 --> 1:16:43.625
[beeping]

1:16:56.166 --> 1:16:57.416
[camera shutter clicking]

1:17:04.208 --> 1:17:05.250
[beeping rapidly]

1:17:06.250 --> 1:17:10.083
Hey, Bloods, I got something!
Right here I got... I'm getting a big hit.

1:17:10.875 --> 1:17:13.125
-I'm getting a big hit, right here.
-Are you sure?

1:17:13.208 --> 1:17:17.125
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's all over,
right in here. Right in this whole area.

1:17:19.166 --> 1:17:20.416
[Paul grunting]

1:17:23.666 --> 1:17:25.625
[Melvin] It's a big hit.
Right here. Right here.

1:17:26.958 --> 1:17:28.458
Right in here, baby. Right in there.

1:17:53.916 --> 1:17:55.541
Oh, my God! Oh, God!

1:18:03.500 --> 1:18:04.541
That's...

1:18:07.375 --> 1:18:08.541
Shit.

1:18:15.958 --> 1:18:16.833
It's Norm.

1:18:19.208 --> 1:18:20.583
Oh, brother.

1:18:29.666 --> 1:18:30.875
[Paul panting]

1:18:54.333 --> 1:18:55.375
[Otis] It's Norm?

1:18:56.000 --> 1:18:57.916
-Yeah, it's Norm.
-[Otis] Oh, shit.

1:19:00.458 --> 1:19:02.583
[Eddie panting and grunting]

1:19:13.916 --> 1:19:15.375
[Otis] Okay. Okay.

1:19:15.916 --> 1:19:17.833
[Eddie] Holy shit. Come on. [voice breaks]

1:19:21.291 --> 1:19:23.333
Shit. Shit.

1:19:29.125 --> 1:19:29.958
Shit.

1:19:32.666 --> 1:19:33.750
[Paul] Hey, Norm.

1:19:35.541 --> 1:19:36.625
We all here, man.

1:19:38.333 --> 1:19:41.166
Otis, Melvin, Eddie.

1:19:44.500 --> 1:19:47.666
I got my son, David. Right here.

1:19:51.458 --> 1:19:53.791
Took us a little longer
than we thought, but...

1:19:55.250 --> 1:19:57.583
we came back like we said we would.

1:20:01.166 --> 1:20:04.541
But this time when we get on that plane,
that Freedom Bird,

1:20:05.125 --> 1:20:06.666
going back to the world,

1:20:08.375 --> 1:20:11.958
you are coming with us, brother.
You coming with us, brother.

1:20:15.083 --> 1:20:17.250
Now, both of your parents have passed,

1:20:17.333 --> 1:20:23.666
I guess you know that, but your sisters,
Janet and Kim, will be waiting for us...

1:20:28.166 --> 1:20:29.958
when we land, brother.

1:20:34.875 --> 1:20:37.291
You goin' home, Blood.

1:20:41.291 --> 1:20:42.666
You're goin' home, Blood.

1:20:49.083 --> 1:20:50.416
Come on, now.

1:21:10.208 --> 1:21:11.416
Blessed holy God.

1:21:14.125 --> 1:21:16.458
We come around
your mighty throne of grace...

1:21:17.500 --> 1:21:19.500
to thank you for this day.

1:21:23.416 --> 1:21:28.750
We thank you for the reunion
of family... and friendship...

1:21:30.541 --> 1:21:31.750
and the brotherhood.

1:21:34.958 --> 1:21:39.625
Continuing in prayer, Lord,
we ask you for traveling grace...

1:21:40.708 --> 1:21:42.041
and the mending of hearts.

1:21:43.791 --> 1:21:46.208
In your son's righteous
and holy name, we pray.

1:21:47.083 --> 1:21:48.875
-Amen.
-[all]  Amen.

1:21:48.958 --> 1:21:50.291
[cicadas chirping loudly]

1:21:51.208 --> 1:21:52.791
Damn! What is that sound?

1:21:54.333 --> 1:21:56.333
Uh, cicadas.

1:21:57.791 --> 1:21:59.791
-Cicadas?
-Yeah.

1:22:00.833 --> 1:22:02.708
They don't sound like that back home.

1:22:04.291 --> 1:22:05.625
We ain't home, son.

1:22:08.166 --> 1:22:09.166
We ain't home.

1:22:11.208 --> 1:22:12.375
[gold bars clinking]

1:22:35.208 --> 1:22:36.041
[grunts]

1:22:39.416 --> 1:22:42.375
-[David] You all right?
-[Paul] Yeah, yeah, yeah. [pants]

1:22:51.875 --> 1:22:54.250
[Paul] Hey, son, get this off of me, man.

1:22:56.416 --> 1:22:57.416
[Otis grunting]

1:23:01.125 --> 1:23:02.125
-[Paul] All right.
-[David] I got it.

1:23:02.208 --> 1:23:04.250
-[Paul] Just let it drop.
-[David] Let it go. [grunts]

1:23:06.541 --> 1:23:07.833
Hand me my water, man.

1:23:10.250 --> 1:23:11.083
[David] Hydrate.

1:23:11.166 --> 1:23:12.583
-[Melvin] Lord have mercy.
-My man.

1:23:14.708 --> 1:23:17.125
Hey, I can manage another 30, 40 pounds.

1:23:17.625 --> 1:23:19.208
-Yeah.
-That be just great, bud.

1:23:19.291 --> 1:23:22.791
My son play the pack mule,
my son gets a fair share.

1:23:24.500 --> 1:23:27.041
-It's fine, Dad. It's fine.
-No, the hell it is.

1:23:27.666 --> 1:23:30.375
When did you turn into a grade-A,
first-rate, certified,

1:23:30.458 --> 1:23:32.333
old, tired and crazy motherfucker?

1:23:32.416 --> 1:23:33.625
Ah, fuck you, man.

1:23:35.708 --> 1:23:38.041
When you've been cheated in life
as much as I have,

1:23:38.541 --> 1:23:42.416
you learn to spot the sign of all them
dirty rat bastards out there.

1:23:42.958 --> 1:23:45.375
-How much you need, huh? [grunts]
-[Paul] Huh?

1:23:47.333 --> 1:23:49.250
That enough? You want more?

1:23:49.333 --> 1:23:51.750
-Man, get that out of my fucking face.
-Huh?

1:23:53.333 --> 1:23:54.416
Do you remember?

1:23:56.458 --> 1:23:58.500
You remember what Norm said about money?

1:24:02.000 --> 1:24:03.416
I don't remember that.

1:24:06.208 --> 1:24:10.333
No, no, no. I am sick and tired

1:24:10.916 --> 1:24:13.833
of trying to get you fools
to love one another.

1:24:13.916 --> 1:24:18.125
Go ahead! You wanna
tear each other apart, go on. Go on!

1:24:19.250 --> 1:24:20.625
Here I thought...

1:24:20.708 --> 1:24:24.166
I hoped that we could be Bloods
one more time.

1:24:24.666 --> 1:24:27.458
But, no, that ain't gonna never
happen again because of this.

1:24:28.666 --> 1:24:33.250
Traded brotherhood for this shit.
Right, Paul?

1:24:33.333 --> 1:24:35.500
That motherfucker
walks backward pigeon-toed.

1:24:35.583 --> 1:24:39.500
"Eddie, you black as a damn crow
Ain't white like snow

1:24:39.583 --> 1:24:40.833
And if you didn't know

1:24:40.916 --> 1:24:43.250
If you ain't got no dough
Then you don't go

1:24:43.333 --> 1:24:44.875
And that's for damn sure"

1:24:45.916 --> 1:24:48.958
-Yeah, well, my mama told me...
-[Paul laughing]

1:24:49.708 --> 1:24:53.458
...that money is the root of all--

1:24:54.583 --> 1:24:56.083
-[Melvin] Oh, shit!
-[Paul groans]

1:24:56.791 --> 1:24:58.166
-Oh, my God!
-What the fuck?

1:24:58.250 --> 1:24:59.916
[Eddie screaming]

1:25:02.416 --> 1:25:03.250
Eddie.

1:25:03.333 --> 1:25:05.208
-[Melvin] Fuck.
-Oh! What?

1:25:05.291 --> 1:25:07.291
-Otis, don't move! It's a minefield!
-[Otis] Eddie!

1:25:07.375 --> 1:25:08.458
It's a minefield!

1:25:08.541 --> 1:25:10.958
-[Eddie screaming]
-[Melvin] Don't move, Otis.

1:25:18.250 --> 1:25:20.375
-Okay, okay, okay. Shh.
-[groaning]

1:25:21.500 --> 1:25:24.625
[Otis] I got you. I got you. I got you.

1:25:24.708 --> 1:25:27.166
-I got you. I got you.
-[whimpers]

1:25:31.791 --> 1:25:34.083
-I got you.
-Bloods.

1:25:44.000 --> 1:25:45.041
[click]

1:25:48.583 --> 1:25:49.750
[David] Jesus!

1:25:52.791 --> 1:25:54.208
-Jesus!
-What?

1:25:54.291 --> 1:25:56.625
Jesus! Dad! Dad!
I think I stepped on something.

1:25:56.708 --> 1:25:59.666
-[Paul] Whoa! Stay right there.
-[David] Motherfucker!

1:25:59.750 --> 1:26:01.416
David, don't move. Don't move.

1:26:05.291 --> 1:26:07.166
-[Hedy] David!
-[Paul] Hey!

1:26:07.250 --> 1:26:08.708
-[Hedy] Everybody freeze!
-[Simon] Everybody okay?

1:26:08.791 --> 1:26:09.625
Hey!

1:26:09.708 --> 1:26:13.416
Dad, no, no! Put it down!
Put it down! They can help!

1:26:13.500 --> 1:26:17.291
-We were just walking back to our camp.
-[Otis] He stepped on something.

1:26:17.375 --> 1:26:20.583
-Is it a pressure plate?
-Well, if it was, he would be dead.

1:26:20.666 --> 1:26:24.250
Uh, maybe it's a dud. Or maybe it's not.

1:26:24.333 --> 1:26:27.083
-We can help you. Look! Look! He can help.
-[device beeps]

1:26:30.875 --> 1:26:32.083
Okay, come on.

1:26:38.083 --> 1:26:41.083
And, David... don't move.

1:26:42.416 --> 1:26:43.916
What are we gonna do about my son?

1:26:44.458 --> 1:26:48.333
Well, all he can do is lift up his foot
and pray to God it doesn't explode.

1:26:49.958 --> 1:26:52.083
There's gotta be something else we can do.

1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:54.500
Well, if there is, I don't know it.

1:26:54.583 --> 1:26:57.875
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1:27:01.125 --> 1:27:02.083
Jethro Bodine.

1:27:02.666 --> 1:27:04.291
-What?
-Who?

1:27:04.791 --> 1:27:07.166
Remember that big ol' hillbilly kid
from Oklahoma?

1:27:07.250 --> 1:27:09.291
He stepped on a toe popper. Remember?

1:27:09.375 --> 1:27:11.833
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:27:11.916 --> 1:27:13.666
Okay, we're gonna spring my son...

1:27:14.208 --> 1:27:16.916
the same way we sprung
that hillbilly kid, you got me?

1:27:17.458 --> 1:27:18.875
[Otis] Yeah, that'll work. That'll work.

1:27:19.666 --> 1:27:20.583
Give me that rope.

1:27:26.166 --> 1:27:28.208
Where am I walking? Where am I walking?

1:27:28.708 --> 1:27:30.791
Straight to me, I swept it. You're good.
You're good.

1:27:33.333 --> 1:27:37.875
Do us both a favor.
Don't fucking shift your weight, okay?

1:27:38.541 --> 1:27:39.833
Stay right where you are.

1:27:39.916 --> 1:27:43.416
David, I want you to take this rope.

1:27:44.583 --> 1:27:49.625
I want you to wrap this rope
around your body. Two times.

1:27:49.708 --> 1:27:53.208
Go ahead. Twice around your body.

1:27:53.916 --> 1:27:57.291
Go on, like that. There you go.

1:27:59.500 --> 1:28:03.791
High as you can, man.
High as you can. Right.

1:28:16.583 --> 1:28:17.666
[David grunts]

1:28:29.208 --> 1:28:33.541
David look at me.
Where did you go to college?

1:28:36.541 --> 1:28:38.458
-The House.
-The House.

1:28:39.250 --> 1:28:40.583
Who went to The House?

1:28:42.958 --> 1:28:45.916
-Come on.
-Edwin Moses. The class of '78.

1:28:46.000 --> 1:28:49.041
-Come on. What he'd do?
-Won two Olympic gold medals.

1:28:49.125 --> 1:28:51.041
-Yeah.
-Four hundred meter hurdles.

1:28:51.125 --> 1:28:55.250
He took 13 steps between each hurdle.
Everybody else took 15.

1:28:57.125 --> 1:29:01.083
David, that man could fly.

1:29:02.791 --> 1:29:04.125
What you gonna do?

1:29:05.750 --> 1:29:07.416
-What you gonna do, David?
-Fly.

1:29:08.125 --> 1:29:09.958
-Like?
-Fly like Moses.

1:29:16.000 --> 1:29:18.500
I want everybody
to take a piece of this rope.

1:29:18.583 --> 1:29:22.041
Back on up. Otis, back on up.

1:29:23.041 --> 1:29:26.625
Back it on up, man.
You, too, Mel. Back it on up.

1:29:26.708 --> 1:29:27.541
All right.

1:29:34.833 --> 1:29:36.791
-Here, take this.
-[Paul] That's good, big man.

1:29:36.875 --> 1:29:38.708
-That's good, big man! Right there.
-Yeah.

1:29:38.791 --> 1:29:40.000
Fuck. Fuck.

1:29:40.083 --> 1:29:42.375
-[Melvin] Get that slack!
-[Paul] Tighten up!

1:29:45.791 --> 1:29:49.208
Now, everybody...

1:29:51.250 --> 1:29:53.458
you get an armful and a handful of rope.

1:29:56.333 --> 1:29:57.958
-We good?
-We good.

1:29:58.041 --> 1:29:59.125
[Simon] I hear you.

1:29:59.208 --> 1:30:03.541
On count of three,
you pull harder than a motherfucker!

1:30:03.625 --> 1:30:04.458
[Otis] Yeah, baby.

1:30:05.458 --> 1:30:06.291
You got me?

1:30:06.375 --> 1:30:07.833
-[Otis] We got you, Blood.
-[Melvin] Got you.

1:30:08.208 --> 1:30:09.166
All right.

1:30:12.916 --> 1:30:14.083
One...

1:30:15.541 --> 1:30:16.583
two...

1:30:18.041 --> 1:30:18.875
three!

1:30:19.083 --> 1:30:20.333
[David screams]

1:30:20.500 --> 1:30:22.208
-Come on, man.
-[whimpers]

1:30:22.291 --> 1:30:23.916
[screaming]

1:30:27.000 --> 1:30:29.875
-[Otis] God is great.
-[grunting]

1:30:30.458 --> 1:30:31.375
[Paul] Okay.

1:30:38.416 --> 1:30:39.875
All right. Now...

1:30:41.166 --> 1:30:43.333
-[Melvin] What the fuck?
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:30:43.416 --> 1:30:46.708
Get on your knees. If you get...
Get on your fucking knees.

1:30:46.791 --> 1:30:49.458
-Dad.
-Put that damn gun down now!

1:30:49.541 --> 1:30:50.875
We're compromised, Melvin.

1:30:51.458 --> 1:30:54.375
Okay, okay, okay. Just take it easy now.

1:30:54.458 --> 1:30:57.833
Whatever you're doing,
it's none of our business. We can just go.

1:30:57.916 --> 1:31:01.500
Otis, the sound of those blasts
traveled, man.

1:31:02.125 --> 1:31:04.041
Somebody is on their way here right now.

1:31:04.125 --> 1:31:06.541
-We gotta get the gold and get outta here.
-[Melvin] You serious?

1:31:06.625 --> 1:31:08.458
-We gotta get somebody for Eddie, Dad.
-Hey, man.

1:31:08.541 --> 1:31:10.000
American Embassy. Somebody.

1:31:10.083 --> 1:31:13.791
-We can't tell nobody nothing.
-Just slow the fuck down, man.

1:31:13.875 --> 1:31:15.166
We have to bury Eddie.

1:31:15.250 --> 1:31:18.083
Are you deaf, man?
Are you deaf? Are you deaf?

1:31:18.166 --> 1:31:19.750
We gotta get out of here, Otis!

1:31:19.833 --> 1:31:22.291
-I'm not leaving Eddie like that!
-I can be helpful to you.

1:31:22.791 --> 1:31:25.916
You can be helpful? Okay.

1:31:27.541 --> 1:31:30.208
Can you bring back the dead? Huh?

1:31:31.750 --> 1:31:34.208
-Get the rope, tie 'em up.
-[David] Not doing it.

1:31:34.291 --> 1:31:35.666
Let's just talk about it.

1:31:35.750 --> 1:31:38.916
Otis, you ain't giving the orders, man.
I'm running shit now.

1:31:39.000 --> 1:31:40.833
[Paul grunting]

1:31:42.416 --> 1:31:44.125
Dad! Dad!

1:31:44.208 --> 1:31:47.833
Dad nothing. Dad nothing. Dad nothing!

1:31:50.000 --> 1:31:51.416
[panting]

1:31:52.500 --> 1:31:55.583
Boy, I've killed far better men than you,

1:31:55.666 --> 1:31:59.916
and I will not hesitate
to plug a hole in you right now.

1:32:01.541 --> 1:32:04.208
David, tie 'em up.

1:32:06.208 --> 1:32:07.208
[coughing]

1:32:07.958 --> 1:32:11.791
You want your share? Tie 'em up.

1:32:13.083 --> 1:32:14.666
You wanna remain my son?

1:32:17.250 --> 1:32:20.583
Get at it. Get at it.

1:32:26.375 --> 1:32:28.166
Come here, son. Come here. Come here.

1:32:29.458 --> 1:32:31.291
-All right.
-[David] Give me your hand.

1:32:35.083 --> 1:32:36.333
You had me fooled.

1:32:44.875 --> 1:32:50.250
You got something to say?
You say it to me. Not my son.

1:32:58.416 --> 1:32:59.833
Let me tell y'all something.

1:33:00.416 --> 1:33:01.791
I'm the motherfucker.

1:33:03.291 --> 1:33:05.916
I... am the motherfucker.

1:33:06.000 --> 1:33:09.208
I'm the motherfucker.
I'm the motherfucker.

1:33:16.791 --> 1:33:18.125
So long, Blood.

1:33:19.625 --> 1:33:20.958
Rest in power.

1:33:23.583 --> 1:33:24.416
Amen.

1:33:25.375 --> 1:33:26.375
-Amen.
-Amen.

1:33:30.416 --> 1:33:32.541
We should give Eddie's share
to his family.

1:33:34.625 --> 1:33:36.333
It's the right thing to do, y'all.

1:33:39.666 --> 1:33:40.666
And David?

1:33:43.791 --> 1:33:46.041
That's my boy. He deserves a fair share.

1:33:50.083 --> 1:33:50.916
Deal?

1:33:53.208 --> 1:33:54.833
-[together] Deal.
-All right.

1:34:25.000 --> 1:34:30.125
[Seppo] I can't believe I was actually...
jealous of you, back at that bar.

1:34:30.958 --> 1:34:34.708
Yeah. You seemed
so fuckin' sure of yourself.

1:34:35.541 --> 1:34:40.500
Should've known you're actually
just a spineless fucking rat.

1:34:41.166 --> 1:34:45.750
Hedy, you can't still want this guy.
Look at him, his father's gonna kill us.

1:34:45.833 --> 1:34:47.083
Seppo, shut up.

1:34:47.708 --> 1:34:50.291
Well, your father scares me
more than landmines.

1:34:50.833 --> 1:34:52.458
[Paul] Shut the hell up, up there.

1:34:57.041 --> 1:34:58.583
-Yeah, over here.
-Here?

1:34:58.666 --> 1:34:59.708
[Otis] Mmm-hmm.

1:35:01.250 --> 1:35:03.250
Take us about a day, and we get to...

1:35:09.583 --> 1:35:13.166
You be careful with this OxyContin shit.
It can be addictive.

1:35:14.791 --> 1:35:15.833
[chuckles]

1:35:20.375 --> 1:35:23.166
-Where were we?
-What about right here?

1:35:23.250 --> 1:35:25.958
-But I think that Vinh should--
-Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm.

1:35:26.625 --> 1:35:29.583
Vinh is out. He in cahoots with Charlie.

1:35:32.125 --> 1:35:33.458
Ain't that right, traitor?

1:35:37.000 --> 1:35:39.000
If you don't trust me by now...

1:35:40.583 --> 1:35:44.375
just shoot me... when you kill them.

1:35:54.000 --> 1:35:55.000
What the hell is that?

1:35:55.916 --> 1:36:00.541
Night vision, baby. Night vision.
Let's see what's shaking.

1:36:04.500 --> 1:36:06.083
I need to urinate.

1:36:07.333 --> 1:36:10.541
-She needs to pee.
-Yeah, I heard her. I'm not deaf.

1:36:11.250 --> 1:36:13.875
Yeah, I know the Geneva Convention's
off the table,

1:36:13.958 --> 1:36:15.583
but maybe just let her take a piss.

1:36:16.458 --> 1:36:20.000
Well, could you untie my hands? Please.

1:36:20.500 --> 1:36:21.875
You gotta go, you gotta go.

1:36:25.541 --> 1:36:26.583
Fast, all right?

1:36:32.791 --> 1:36:33.875
[in French]

1:36:36.000 --> 1:36:37.583
-[in English] To the tree.
-[speaking French]

1:36:40.666 --> 1:36:45.083
[in English] David, don't you want
the first time I unzip and remove my pants

1:36:45.166 --> 1:36:47.041
to be under better circumstances?

1:36:48.541 --> 1:36:49.791
[urinating]

1:36:49.875 --> 1:36:50.916
[Hedy exclaims]

1:36:52.458 --> 1:36:53.958
[Hedy sighs in relief]

1:36:54.041 --> 1:36:58.708
Were you flirting with me the other night
because you were looking for an easy fuck

1:36:58.791 --> 1:37:01.333
or because you were
actually interested in me?

1:37:01.875 --> 1:37:05.041
-Actually, I'm interested.
-Uh-huh?

1:37:08.875 --> 1:37:14.750
Yeah. You left your wealthy family behind
to do something good, help people, kids.

1:37:17.541 --> 1:37:20.333
And you're fine, too. I ain't gonna lie.

1:37:21.250 --> 1:37:24.166
Wow. Then let me go. [chuckles]

1:37:26.041 --> 1:37:30.250
Give me a ten-minute head start.
All I ask, please?

1:37:32.541 --> 1:37:33.375
Hmm?

1:37:34.166 --> 1:37:38.416
You know, I hate to cockblock.
She cute, though.

1:37:40.583 --> 1:37:42.166
Mel, take her back to the tree.

1:37:43.291 --> 1:37:45.375
You better listen to your pop, son.

1:37:45.458 --> 1:37:49.333
You're a worthless fuck. Just so you know,
I was only trying to escape.

1:37:49.416 --> 1:37:51.583
I wouldn't fuck you
for all the gold in the world.

1:37:51.666 --> 1:37:52.833
[in French]

1:37:55.875 --> 1:37:56.875
[Paul laughing]

1:38:13.750 --> 1:38:17.583
Just what I thought. Just what I thought.

1:38:25.625 --> 1:38:28.125
Mel, you make sure that rope is tight.

1:38:28.208 --> 1:38:30.000
-[Melvin] Oh, yeah.
-[David] Hey, Dad.

1:38:30.666 --> 1:38:31.791
Okay. Okay.

1:38:32.416 --> 1:38:33.708
-[Paul groans] God damn!
-[David] Get the gun!

1:38:33.791 --> 1:38:35.416
-[Paul] God damn!
-[Otis] I got the gun.

1:38:35.500 --> 1:38:37.875
Drag his ass over there.
Drag his ass over there.

1:38:37.958 --> 1:38:39.708
-Seppo's loose! Give me the gun!
-[Paul] Get him.

1:38:39.791 --> 1:38:42.083
-[Otis] I'll crack your head open!
-[Seppo panting]

1:38:43.458 --> 1:38:46.708
[Paul groans] I knew it! I knew it!

1:38:46.791 --> 1:38:51.708
[laughs] Another motherfucking
dope fiend double-cross.

1:38:52.833 --> 1:38:55.583
David, you don't see what Otis is doing?

1:38:56.166 --> 1:38:59.250
You're playin' into his fuckin' hands!

1:39:00.375 --> 1:39:03.333
Your dear mother would be ashamed of you!

1:39:04.708 --> 1:39:08.208
Yeah, you ain't no fuckin' son of mine!

1:39:09.250 --> 1:39:10.875
You're dead to me. You hear me?

1:39:10.958 --> 1:39:13.083
-[Otis] Get the rope.
-[Paul] Gone! Buried!

1:39:13.166 --> 1:39:15.166
-[Otis] Get the rope.
-[Paul] You're a fucking coward.

1:39:15.250 --> 1:39:17.541
-Fucking disgrace!
-Get the rope! Get the rope, David.

1:39:17.625 --> 1:39:20.666
Don't get shit. You stay your ass
right the fuck there.

1:39:20.750 --> 1:39:23.958
You stay your ass right the fuck there!
[growls]

1:39:48.458 --> 1:39:50.291
You've had quite an adventure.

1:39:51.833 --> 1:39:53.583
-My friend, let me help.
-Oh, no.

1:39:53.666 --> 1:39:56.000
I got it, I got it. Thank you.
Thank you, I got it.

1:39:56.500 --> 1:39:57.375
Hey.

1:39:58.791 --> 1:39:59.916
[panting]

1:40:04.958 --> 1:40:06.041
[David grunts]

1:40:08.125 --> 1:40:10.125
-Get this off of me.
-Where's Eddie?

1:40:11.875 --> 1:40:15.750
[panting] Broke his ankle.
We left him with food and water.

1:40:20.083 --> 1:40:21.541
He insisted.

1:40:23.166 --> 1:40:25.250
That boy is stubborn as an old mule.

1:40:29.958 --> 1:40:31.916
-[Vinh] Sounds very bad.
-[Otis] Yeah.

1:40:32.000 --> 1:40:33.916
I knew you should not have gone alone.

1:40:35.083 --> 1:40:37.916
I have a friend in the district.
He'll send a rescue group.

1:40:38.458 --> 1:40:41.958
How would you like to earn more money
than you ever earned in your whole life?

1:40:47.750 --> 1:40:49.583
Eddie didn't break an ankle, did he?

1:40:51.625 --> 1:40:53.208
No. Help me.

1:40:55.375 --> 1:40:56.250
You kill him?

1:40:57.250 --> 1:40:58.291
Oh, God, no.

1:41:00.416 --> 1:41:01.416
Minefield.

1:41:02.125 --> 1:41:03.250
Otis!

1:41:03.333 --> 1:41:04.791
-Huh?
-Here come your partners.

1:41:09.916 --> 1:41:11.208
[Otis] Ain't no partners of mine.

1:41:11.791 --> 1:41:12.666
[Seppo] Hedy!

1:41:13.583 --> 1:41:15.333
-Hedy!

1:41:25.166 --> 1:41:27.333
-[in English] He said you have his gold.
-[Paul speaking Vietnamese]

1:41:28.000 --> 1:41:29.000
[in English] Forget that.

1:41:30.416 --> 1:41:32.750
[in English] We trade
your friend for gold.

1:41:32.833 --> 1:41:33.833
He ain't our friend!

1:41:33.916 --> 1:41:35.541
-What?
-You heard me.

1:41:35.625 --> 1:41:38.500
Hedy, for God's sakes, help me.

1:41:38.583 --> 1:41:40.208
[Hedy] David, you've got to help him.

1:41:41.208 --> 1:41:42.291
Otis?

1:41:43.583 --> 1:41:44.541
Please.

1:41:49.291 --> 1:41:50.666
We want him alive.

1:42:03.541 --> 1:42:05.000
-Fuck!
-Fuck.

1:42:07.916 --> 1:42:08.958
[Otis] We can share.

1:42:09.041 --> 1:42:10.500
[men speaking Vietnamese]

1:42:10.583 --> 1:42:12.416
There's enough for everybody.

1:42:12.500 --> 1:42:14.333
[in Vietnamese]

1:42:17.791 --> 1:42:18.750
What's he saying?

1:42:19.750 --> 1:42:20.916
[in English] I like you.

1:42:21.000 --> 1:42:25.625
Black Uncle Sam. We share.

1:42:27.000 --> 1:42:29.958
-This for you, rest for us.
-[David] Hey!

1:42:30.041 --> 1:42:31.541
Look, man, we're Americans, all right?

1:42:31.625 --> 1:42:35.625
You kill us or hurt him, you got
an international fiasco on your hands.

1:42:35.708 --> 1:42:39.041
We're not gonna kill anyone... yet.

1:42:40.333 --> 1:42:41.291
[Otis] You heard him.

1:42:41.791 --> 1:42:43.875
Nobody gets nothing. Nothing!

1:42:44.375 --> 1:42:49.750
Black Uncle Sam, this is belong
to Vietnamese people.

1:42:50.500 --> 1:42:51.708
We take what is ours.

1:42:51.791 --> 1:42:53.708
Hey, boy, you ain't taking what's ours.

1:42:53.791 --> 1:42:58.000
You look on that gold bar right there,
it says USA, my friend.

1:42:58.083 --> 1:43:00.000
You, USA?

1:43:00.083 --> 1:43:01.083
Damn skippy.

1:43:02.166 --> 1:43:05.333
-It say USA, but I don't think so.
-Well, you better believe it.

1:43:06.333 --> 1:43:07.875
Who the fuck are you, man?

1:43:08.791 --> 1:43:10.583

Vietnam officer.

1:43:11.833 --> 1:43:14.375
Oh, yeah? Where are your official badges?

1:43:16.166 --> 1:43:18.875
We don't need no stinkin' official badges.

1:43:20.708 --> 1:43:22.625
Do you know Calley, brother?

1:43:24.916 --> 1:43:27.791
Yeah. And first of all,
you ain't my brother,

1:43:28.458 --> 1:43:30.458
and I know California, yeah.

1:43:31.041 --> 1:43:32.625
You imbecile.

1:43:33.125 --> 1:43:34.625
It's not a state.

1:43:35.250 --> 1:43:38.916
Lt. Calley. Ever heard of My Lai?

1:43:40.166 --> 1:43:41.958
I know all about My Lai.

1:43:42.041 --> 1:43:44.916
And you, GI murder,

1:43:45.416 --> 1:43:49.000
killer of innocent children and babies.

1:43:49.083 --> 1:43:50.958
[Paul]  There were atrocities
on both sides.

1:43:51.041 --> 1:43:53.375
So why don't you go chew on
some motherfucking chopsticks?

1:43:53.458 --> 1:43:55.041
-Chill, chill, chill.
-No, no, fuck him!

1:43:57.625 --> 1:43:58.541
[Paul grunts]

1:44:01.625 --> 1:44:05.666

-Oh, fuck!

1:44:19.708 --> 1:44:21.125
[screaming]

1:44:22.791 --> 1:44:24.000
[yelling]

1:44:25.375 --> 1:44:28.000
-Chavy! Chavy!
-[man screaming]

1:44:28.083 --> 1:44:29.750
-[Hedy] Simon! [screams]
-[David] Stay down!

1:44:29.833 --> 1:44:31.458

[Paul grunting and panting]

1:45:04.666 --> 1:45:05.666
Where's Norm?

1:45:06.208 --> 1:45:08.375
-He's gone, man. KIA.
-Oh!

1:45:09.375 --> 1:45:11.208
Đi đi mau!  Let's move.

1:45:11.291 --> 1:45:12.875
-Go ahead. Go ahead!
-Đi đi mau!

1:45:12.958 --> 1:45:14.500
Go ahead. I got this.

1:45:18.000 --> 1:45:19.083
[David groans]

1:45:19.958 --> 1:45:21.250
[Otis] Okay. All right, okay.

1:45:21.833 --> 1:45:23.083

I know, boy. I know.

1:45:45.875 --> 1:45:47.166
Just keep the pressure on.

1:45:48.583 --> 1:45:50.541
Breathe through it.
Just breathe through it. Keep on going.

1:45:50.625 --> 1:45:51.583
[liquid trickling]

1:45:51.666 --> 1:45:55.291
Keep on. All right. Press this.
Press this on.

1:45:55.375 --> 1:45:58.500
Here we go. Press it on. Press it on!

1:45:58.583 --> 1:46:01.833

[Otis] There you go.
Man, it's gotta be tight.

1:46:15.583 --> 1:46:16.666
Clean through and through.

1:46:17.750 --> 1:46:19.166
[David continues groaning]

1:46:20.333 --> 1:46:21.791
-[Otis] There you go. Hold on.
-Hey!

1:46:21.875 --> 1:46:24.375
Straighten up! Straighten up!

1:46:25.083 --> 1:46:26.250
[David groaning]

1:46:27.250 --> 1:46:30.333
[Otis] All right. All right, hold on.
It's all right.

1:46:30.416 --> 1:46:31.458
How he doin'?

1:46:31.541 --> 1:46:34.583
-[Otis] You'll survive. You'll survive.
-How's he doing, man?

1:46:34.666 --> 1:46:35.791
[groans]

1:46:35.875 --> 1:46:37.708
[Otis] That's nothing but a mosquito bite.

1:46:37.791 --> 1:46:40.125
-[Paul] Don't fuck it up, man.
-[Otis] Come on. Come on.

1:46:40.208 --> 1:46:41.750
[screaming]

1:46:43.000 --> 1:46:44.333
[Otis] Man the hell up.

1:46:45.083 --> 1:46:47.875
-All right. All right. All right.
-Okay, look...

1:46:49.458 --> 1:46:52.875
First thing that gook's gonna do
when he gets back to town,

1:46:53.500 --> 1:46:58.166
he gonna round up
all the local muscle he can. Now look.

1:46:59.750 --> 1:47:00.708
Who you callin'?

1:47:01.208 --> 1:47:03.958
I'm calling Tiên.
She can get us out of here.

1:47:04.041 --> 1:47:05.166
[phone beeping]

1:47:05.583 --> 1:47:07.750
-What the fuck you do that for?
-[Otis] What the fuck...

1:47:07.833 --> 1:47:10.458
-I should shoot your crazy ass dead.
-[Paul] Do it.

1:47:14.208 --> 1:47:16.333
Ain't nothing to it but to do it, Blood.

1:47:17.083 --> 1:47:18.708
Don't tempt me, motherfucker.

1:47:18.791 --> 1:47:21.250
What the fuck is wrong with you guys?

1:47:22.416 --> 1:47:23.416
[Vinh] Brother.

1:47:27.458 --> 1:47:29.291
We have very little gas left.

1:47:29.833 --> 1:47:33.125
Perhaps enough gas
to get to the temple ruin.

1:47:33.208 --> 1:47:35.625
-A few miles from here.
-[Otis] What do we achieve by that, huh?

1:47:36.916 --> 1:47:39.916
If you wanna choose to fight these men,
you need some defenses.

1:47:40.708 --> 1:47:45.916
Otis, try doing the math, huh?
Tiên is with the V.C.

1:47:46.541 --> 1:47:49.333
Otis, that's how they knew
about the gold, man.

1:47:49.416 --> 1:47:54.333
That's how this whole fucking ambush
was a setup! Mel?

1:47:54.416 --> 1:47:55.541
[Melvin] You know Tiên?

1:47:56.458 --> 1:47:57.625
No, I do not.

1:47:57.708 --> 1:47:59.541
And you expect him to tell the truth.

1:48:00.833 --> 1:48:04.250
Okay, look here. Look here, man. Okay.

1:48:05.041 --> 1:48:07.500
We gonna cut through the jungle
to a river.

1:48:08.583 --> 1:48:12.916
To a village, Hng Ng.
Right there, Hng Ng.

1:48:13.708 --> 1:48:16.291
Wait till nightfall.
We gonna rip off a boat,

1:48:16.375 --> 1:48:18.458
and then we skirt past Tân Châu.

1:48:18.541 --> 1:48:20.041
-[Simon] Hey, guys! No!
-Tân Châu.

1:48:20.916 --> 1:48:23.666
We can't go there.
That's 20 miles away from here.

1:48:23.750 --> 1:48:27.583
So what? You scared of
a little bit of exercise, fat boy? Huh?

1:48:27.666 --> 1:48:29.583
[Otis] David's leg won't handle that.

1:48:29.666 --> 1:48:33.041
[voice breaks]
David ain't my problem... anymore.

1:48:33.125 --> 1:48:34.500
Man, David is your son.

1:48:35.166 --> 1:48:36.166
My son...

1:48:41.125 --> 1:48:42.333
is a backstabber.

1:48:51.666 --> 1:48:52.958
Are you with us or not?

1:48:55.208 --> 1:48:58.916
My share is my share. You do what you want
with his share. Hear me?

1:49:01.083 --> 1:49:03.083
Listen, you crazy fuck!

1:49:04.250 --> 1:49:07.916
-Norman wouldn't want us to split up.
-That's right. He wouldn't.

1:49:09.458 --> 1:49:14.000
And that's my problem. Ah.
That's my problem, Otis.

1:49:14.875 --> 1:49:19.541
Stormin' Norm ain't with the living.
You feel me?

1:49:21.916 --> 1:49:22.958
My problem.

1:49:29.375 --> 1:49:30.541
Peace out!

1:49:33.958 --> 1:49:34.916
[grunts]

1:49:38.125 --> 1:49:39.041

1:49:48.958 --> 1:49:50.416
[screaming]

1:49:54.083 --> 1:49:56.791
[screams continue]

1:49:58.625 --> 1:50:02.083
[Paul] "The Lord is my shepherd!
I shall not want!

1:50:02.166 --> 1:50:05.250
He maketh me lie down in green pastures!

1:50:05.333 --> 1:50:10.291
He leadeth me beside the still waters!
He restoreth my soul!

1:50:10.375 --> 1:50:16.541
He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness for His name's sake!

1:50:16.625 --> 1:50:20.250
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death,

1:50:20.333 --> 1:50:24.000
I will fear no evil, for Thou art with me.

1:50:24.083 --> 1:50:29.083
Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me!"

1:50:29.166 --> 1:50:30.583
[Paul continues crying in distance]

1:50:54.000 --> 1:50:56.083
I can help you get it out of the country.

1:51:01.041 --> 1:51:04.041
-All right. We'll give you a share.
-How much is that?

1:51:07.458 --> 1:51:08.416
Million.

1:51:09.791 --> 1:51:10.833
We want in, too.

1:51:12.458 --> 1:51:14.125
-[Otis] You want in?
-Yeah.

1:51:15.875 --> 1:51:16.708
[Otis] All right.

1:51:16.791 --> 1:51:19.166
Damn, Otis. Just put the gold
on Craigslist.

1:51:19.708 --> 1:51:22.625
Mel, what am I supposed to do, huh?
Eddie, Simon,

1:51:22.708 --> 1:51:25.916
that bullshit with Paul and the kidnapping
never happened, all right?

1:51:26.000 --> 1:51:27.375
And what about Seppo?

1:51:27.458 --> 1:51:30.583
We all know what happened to Seppo.
He stepped on a landmine.

1:51:31.833 --> 1:51:34.916
Hey, so real quick,
just for our edification.

1:51:35.458 --> 1:51:37.958
Our share is also gonna be a million?

1:51:40.083 --> 1:51:44.166
Shit!

1:51:45.458 --> 1:51:46.291
[Otis] Half.

1:51:50.333 --> 1:51:54.375
[Paul] They ain't snatching my gold.
Not me. No, sir. Not this time.

1:51:54.458 --> 1:51:57.875
I ain't getting fucked again. Trying
to fuck me with salt in the Vaseline.

2:15:05.791 --> 2:15:08.375
That the green
is more important than black.

Was Tiên in on all this?

2:15:31.125 --> 2:15:34.833
Tiên is a very smart woman,
but she doesn't have the appetite

She knows nothing about this.

I came back to confront the demons
that haunted me and tortured you.

I made you feel like you weren't loved.

2:20:32.041 --> 2:20:38.000
Our brother Stormin' Norman always
commanded us Bloods, love one another.

2:20:40.500 --> 2:20:42.166
In that way, I failed you, man.

2:20:44.291 --> 2:20:46.000
All I can say to you is...

2:20:49.458 --> 2:20:52.041
I'm sorry I put you through holy hell.

[Paul]  ...it wasn't your fault.

2:21:06.208 --> 2:21:10.666
There are things about me that you
will never know or understand, David.

I wish I could turn back
the hands of time...

2:21:33.583 --> 2:21:34.458
