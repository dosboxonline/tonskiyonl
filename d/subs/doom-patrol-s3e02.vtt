[The Brain]<i> This</i>

01:24.751 --> 01:27.153
The hour upon us is dark.

01:27.253 --> 01:30.156
Our very way of life
is under attack.

01:30.256 --> 01:34.594
Our dedication to evil,
besieged.

01:34.661 --> 01:37.564
But we will not shy
from adversity.

01:37.630 --> 01:42.102
Niles Caulder will be stopped.

01:42.168 --> 01:44.671
Evidently, he's taken out
our man in Paraguay.

01:44.771 --> 01:48.842
And that insufferable
Eric Morden along with him.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.977
<i>Je m'en fous.</i>

01:51.077 --> 01:53.513
[The Brain] In light of this
new intelligence, it appears
we're next on his list.

01:53.613 --> 01:59.419
However, it'll take much more
than whatever two-bit army
Caulder's building to stop us.

02:00.320 --> 02:01.754
<i>Monsieur</i> Mallah...

02:03.490 --> 02:04.591
Send him in.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.803
Kindly send him in, please.

02:21.441 --> 02:24.177
-I thought you said
this was fixed.
-It was working this morning.

02:24.277 --> 02:27.380
-We have access to the most
intelligent alien technologies.
-Give me a second...

02:27.480 --> 02:30.016
-And we can't even...
Oh, God damn it.
-Let me just try and see...

02:30.116 --> 02:32.886
-Just leave it. Leave it!
-Oh, okay. Fine. Okay.

It's just us, Samuelson. Relax.

03:00.747 --> 03:02.582
[The Brain] Thank you
for coming, Garguax.

03:02.682 --> 03:04.751
You've already been briefed,
so I'll be quick.

03:04.851 --> 03:08.755
Our crusade against Caulder
is in jeopardy,
and we need back up.

03:08.855 --> 03:13.393
When this transponder
gives the signal, you'll know
the targets onsite.

03:13.493 --> 03:17.830
She must be eliminated
swiftly and with severity.

03:17.897 --> 03:19.165
Of course.

03:19.232 --> 03:20.333
And who is the target?

03:28.608 --> 03:32.212
[The Brain]<i> You're our most</i>

03:32.278 --> 03:34.013
<i>We're counting on you.</i>

03:34.080 --> 03:39.452
<i>The fate of our entire</i>
<i>organization rests</i>

No sign of the target.

04:33.006 --> 04:37.243
But when she dares
to show her face,
we'll be ready.

04:37.310 --> 04:41.180
In the meantime,
our presence here
will go completely unnoticed.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.183

All good. I'm on it.

10:27.426 --> 10:29.028
Think this little hellraiser
was just looking
for some attention.

10:29.128 --> 10:31.464
Which is why we were hoping
to let him cry it out,

10:31.530 --> 10:33.466
so that he can start going
to sleep on his own.

10:33.532 --> 10:34.767
What? No!

10:34.834 --> 10:37.637
You can't spoil a baby

10:40.973 --> 10:43.209

16:19.278 --> 16:23.549
I didn't even think
you knew this place existed.

16:23.649 --> 16:26.352
-Are you okay?
-I was going to ask you
the same thing.

16:27.186 --> 16:28.120
What do you mean?

16:29.688 --> 16:31.790
[whimpering] Niles.

16:31.857 --> 16:33.058
He's gone now.

16:34.326 --> 16:37.329
-Are you sad?
-It's complicated.

16:38.530 --> 16:39.398
But I'm fine.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.034
They're going on a trip.

16:43.669 --> 16:45.471
I'll tell them bon voyage.

16:46.138 --> 16:47.072
We're not going?

16:47.172 --> 16:48.707
I don't really need a vacation.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.379
Wait, do you wanna go?

16:54.847 --> 16:55.914
I think we should.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.816
I think it might
be good for you.

17:07.259 --> 17:08.260
[sighs]

17:08.994 --> 17:10.362
I'm in.

17:10.429 --> 17:12.431
But you fuck rags
better not ruin this.

17:12.531 --> 17:14.066
[Rita] Hoorah!

17:14.166 --> 17:16.602
Victor, fetch the sump pump.

17:21.707 --> 17:22.775
What about Tin Man?

17:22.875 --> 17:23.942
Fuck!

17:24.042 --> 17:26.045
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

17:26.111 --> 17:28.380
Fucking shit body. Fuck!

17:29.782 --> 17:32.518
-Still no luck?
-Any second now.

17:32.584 --> 17:34.520
You sure there's no one
we can call?

17:34.586 --> 17:37.022
Sweetie, It's fine. I'm okay.

17:37.089 --> 17:38.857
Really.

17:38.924 --> 17:42.895
This doesn't have anything
to do with your hand issue,
does it?

17:42.961 --> 17:44.063
What hand issue?

17:45.064 --> 17:46.799
Dad...

17:46.899 --> 17:49.568
Come on, seriously,
I'm not stupid.
I've seen your hand tremor.

17:49.635 --> 17:51.637
Oh, that?

17:51.737 --> 17:55.140
It's nothing. It's probably
just some built up electrical
discharge or some shit.

17:55.240 --> 17:58.410
Mel's mee-maw
had a similar issue.

18:00.612 --> 18:02.714
Before she...

18:02.781 --> 18:03.949
before she passed away.

18:04.049 --> 18:05.217
Mel's mee-maw?

18:05.284 --> 18:08.220
Who died when she was
like 193?

18:12.257 --> 18:13.158
What was it?

18:13.892 --> 18:14.993
Parkinson's.

18:16.995 --> 18:18.831
Well, that sucks.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.934
But last I checked, robots
don't get Parkinson's.

18:22.000 --> 18:25.170
-Maybe robots
with human brains can?
-Uh-huh...

18:25.270 --> 18:27.272
Look, I'm not trying
to freak you out or anything.

18:27.339 --> 18:29.308
I just think you need
to get it checked out.

18:29.408 --> 18:30.576
I'm fine.

18:31.777 --> 18:33.178
Dad...

18:33.278 --> 18:36.648
I am really happy we're
in each other's lives again.

18:37.249 --> 18:38.650
I am.

18:38.750 --> 18:40.586
But if you're going to keep
looking after Rory

18:40.652 --> 18:43.422
and driving my wife nuts
in the process,

18:43.489 --> 18:45.290
I need to be sure
it's safe.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.159
For his sake.

18:53.532 --> 18:55.300
And also I love you.

18:57.002 --> 18:57.970
I love you, too.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.011
[sighs]

19:08.013 --> 19:09.214
[Jane] Hey, dipshit.

19:09.948 --> 19:11.350
Oh. Hey guys.

19:11.450 --> 19:14.486
-We're going on vacation.
-Huh. Nice suitcase?

19:14.553 --> 19:16.522
-[Rita groans]
-Not a suitcase.

19:16.622 --> 19:18.023
It's a useless sack of shit.

19:18.123 --> 19:19.491
[Rita] I heard that.

19:19.558 --> 19:20.459
It's me, Cliff.

19:20.526 --> 19:22.294
-Rita.
-Like I said.

19:22.361 --> 19:24.229
So, you in or what?

19:24.796 --> 19:25.964
Fuck yes.

19:27.733 --> 19:29.334
Oh, uh...

19:29.401 --> 19:31.570
Can someone do me a solid
and knock me on my ass
real quick?

19:31.670 --> 19:33.138
That usually loosens
me right up.

19:33.205 --> 19:34.706
-You sure
that's really such a--
-[Rita groans]

19:34.806 --> 19:35.874
With fucking pleasure!

19:35.974 --> 19:37.509
[Cliff yelling]

19:39.845 --> 19:40.913
Thanks, Hammerhead!

19:43.849 --> 19:45.584
[Vic] What a ghost town.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.921
[Cliff] Was this really
the best place
Secretary could find?

19:49.021 --> 19:50.155
[Rita] Is it dreadful?

19:50.222 --> 19:52.824
Please tell me
it's not dreadful.

19:52.891 --> 19:54.726
-[Vic] Well, there's a lake.
-[Rita] Oh.

19:54.826 --> 19:56.762
This says not to swim.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.097
Leeches gather
along the shoreline.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.367
-[Rita] Oh, dear God.
-Quiet, sack.

20:02.434 --> 20:04.069
They have Wi-Fi, right?

20:04.169 --> 20:08.340
They have a rotary phone
in the lobby
for $2.99 a minute.

20:08.407 --> 20:13.412
But it seems
like there's lots of cool
activities on the grounds.

20:13.512 --> 20:15.180
Like that one.

20:16.782 --> 20:18.250
What is it?

20:18.350 --> 20:20.285
[Cliff] It's called
The Backbone.

20:20.385 --> 20:22.721
Quickest way to discover
who you really are.

20:22.788 --> 20:26.225
The only way
to reach the top
is to let go of all your fear.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.762
Ooh, says here

20:30.862 --> 20:34.733
back in the '70s,
Nixon climbed up, and when
he came back down, he resigned.

20:39.438 --> 20:41.073
Huh!

20:41.139 --> 20:42.608
[breathing heavily]

21:47.272 --> 21:48.273
[gasping]

21:52.444 --> 21:53.979
[breathing heavily]

22:21.173 --> 22:22.641
[breathes heavily]

22:39.691 --> 22:40.892
What was that?

23:01.680 --> 23:02.748
Hey, pal.

23:06.218 --> 23:07.786
Negative Spirit release.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.763
Where'd you go?

23:25.570 --> 23:26.405
[sighs]

23:26.471 --> 23:27.639
[dialing]

23:50.162 --> 23:52.831
You're not actually going
to climb that thing, are you?

23:52.931 --> 23:55.233
Why? What's the problem?

23:55.300 --> 23:57.936
-It's a death trap.
-Chickenshit.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.573
All right.
Up you go.

24:06.945 --> 24:09.414
[grunting]

24:12.250 --> 24:13.919
You going to get that
checked out any time soon?

24:13.985 --> 24:16.154
Jesus Christ,
you sound like my daughter.

24:16.254 --> 24:19.357
What the hell's the point
in getting me checked out?

24:19.458 --> 24:21.092
So you can find out
what's wrong?

24:21.159 --> 24:23.695
And then what?
Sink into another
20 year depression

24:23.795 --> 24:27.199
when I also find out
that there's nothing
I can actually do about it?

24:27.299 --> 24:30.035
-Maybe there is.
-Right. 'Cause I'm that lucky.

24:30.135 --> 24:32.771
Nah! If I'm living
on borrowed time,

24:32.838 --> 24:35.006
I'm not going to
waste it like I did before.

24:35.106 --> 24:38.143
I'm going
to enjoy the ever-living
fuck out of it.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.312
And finding out
I might have some

24:40.378 --> 24:44.349
terminal disease isn't exactly
my idea of a fucking party.
Got that, baby blue?

24:45.684 --> 24:47.352
[scoffs]

24:47.452 --> 24:48.854
I was wondering how long
it would take you to
give me shit about this.

24:50.522 --> 24:52.457
Seriously, what's the deal?

24:52.524 --> 24:54.392
I'm kind of on ice right now.

24:54.493 --> 24:57.729
S.T.A.R. Labs
isn't too happy with me.

24:57.829 --> 25:00.165
Roni got into some
trouble and I tried
to help her out of it.

25:00.966 --> 25:02.033
Makes sense.

25:02.133 --> 25:03.001
You love her.

25:03.068 --> 25:05.403
Whoa! It's not about that.

25:05.504 --> 25:07.239
I was just trying
to give her another chance.

25:07.339 --> 25:10.408
-Help her go
in a different direction.
-'Cause you love her.

25:10.509 --> 25:14.079
No, 'cause she's a good person
who got dealt a bad hand.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.580
And she deserves better.

25:15.680 --> 25:17.148
I was just trying
to give her that.

25:17.215 --> 25:20.519
-'Cause... you--
-This is not about Roni,
all right?

25:21.686 --> 25:24.022
I just don't like
having my wings clipped.

25:24.089 --> 25:25.190
That's all.

25:26.925 --> 25:29.427
[sighs] I'm Cyborg.

25:29.528 --> 25:31.730
My tech is part
of who I am.

25:31.830 --> 25:35.734
Your tech is just a bunch
of tangled wires
and twisted metal.

25:35.834 --> 25:38.270
It's got nothing to do
with who you are.

25:40.438 --> 25:41.673
Trust me.

25:47.112 --> 25:48.446
[sighs]

25:50.549 --> 25:53.752
[Rita] Unfurrow
your brow, Jane.

25:53.852 --> 25:56.288
You can't
afford the frown lines.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.789
You can't even see me.

25:57.889 --> 25:59.224
[Rita] I don't need to.

25:59.291 --> 26:02.127
Are you going to relax at all
on this vacation?

26:02.227 --> 26:05.196
Mmm. I'm relaxed.

26:05.263 --> 26:08.466
She said
with ever the defensive tone.

26:08.567 --> 26:12.470
Look, I'm just not built
to kick back, okay?

26:12.571 --> 26:14.806
-That's not my job.
-I see.

26:14.906 --> 26:16.808
But surely
the others won't begrudge you

26:16.908 --> 26:19.110
a little well-deserved time
for self-care?

26:19.210 --> 26:20.979
They don't.

26:21.079 --> 26:24.149
They've actually been trying
to help out more.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.650
Even the girl.

26:25.750 --> 26:29.054
[scoffs] But that's not
how it's supposed to work.

26:29.120 --> 26:30.822
I'm the one
who looks out for her,

26:30.922 --> 26:32.824
not the other way around.

26:32.924 --> 26:35.827
I guess I've just been
a little off lately 'cause...

26:36.761 --> 26:39.664
[sighs in exasperation]

26:39.764 --> 26:43.335
Whatever. It doesn't matter.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.836
What about you?

26:44.936 --> 26:48.139
Is this place helping
with your situation?

26:48.239 --> 26:49.941
-[Rita] Let's see.
-[squishing]

26:50.008 --> 26:52.510
[inhales, strains]

26:52.611 --> 26:55.413
[moans, groans]

26:55.480 --> 26:58.083
[grunts] Not yet.

26:58.149 --> 26:59.484
To be completely honest,

26:59.584 --> 27:01.920
I'm not in any particular hurry
to reconstitute.

27:01.987 --> 27:06.424
-Why not?
-Even if I could manage
to pull myself together,

27:06.491 --> 27:07.926
what's the point?

27:07.993 --> 27:09.327
Who would I even be?

27:09.427 --> 27:12.030
I tried to be Rita Farr,
I failed.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.833
I tried to be the Beekeeper,
I failed.

27:14.933 --> 27:19.304
And poor Gertrude Cramp,
she never even had a chance.

27:19.371 --> 27:22.207
Yeah. Wait, who the fuck
is the Beekeeper?

27:22.307 --> 27:26.211
[Rita sighs wearily] A failed
effort to reinvent myself.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.779
However, I think

27:27.846 --> 27:30.515
"Amorphous putty woman"
suits me better.

27:30.615 --> 27:33.885
Even if this vacation
fails to restore my body,

27:33.985 --> 27:37.722
at the very least, we're out of
the Chief's dismal flophouse.

27:37.822 --> 27:40.291
It's a bit difficult
to move past one's grief

27:40.358 --> 27:43.862
when you're still eating
the departed's rocky road.

27:43.962 --> 27:46.464
He really was a rat bastard,
wasn't he?

27:46.531 --> 27:48.400
What a cruel thing
to say about rats.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.502
[chuckles]

27:50.568 --> 27:54.973
First he ruins our lives,
and then he just abandons us.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.574
[Rita] Unforgivable.

27:58.643 --> 28:02.047
[sighs] Thank heavens
we're finally free of him.

28:03.048 --> 28:04.249
Yep.

28:04.349 --> 28:06.551
[Rita] So it's settled then?

28:06.651 --> 28:08.653
We're glad he's gone.

28:08.720 --> 28:13.058
[sighs deeply] Yep.

28:13.658 --> 28:14.826
[slurps]

28:16.361 --> 28:17.862
[mumbling] I'm fine.
I'm fuckin' fine.

28:17.929 --> 28:19.264
I don't need
to get checked out.

28:19.364 --> 28:22.333
Why don't you
get fuckin' checked out?

28:24.069 --> 28:27.906
Everyone needs
to fuckin' relax.

28:28.006 --> 28:29.741
[man] Sounds like you're
the one that needs to relax.

28:29.841 --> 28:33.445
Uh, oh, sorry. Didn't think
anyone else was in here.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.612
No problem.

28:35.747 --> 28:37.582
You know... [grunts]

28:37.682 --> 28:40.385
this place will do wonders
for you if you let it.

28:43.121 --> 28:44.289
[sizzles]

28:49.027 --> 28:51.563
Garguax the Decimator.

28:51.629 --> 28:54.132
-Cliff Steele.
-Pleasure.

28:54.232 --> 28:57.769
-First time at the resort?
-Yeah. You?

28:57.869 --> 29:00.371
Technically, sure.

29:00.438 --> 29:02.741
Yeah, I've been here
a while, though.

29:04.609 --> 29:07.545
Hey, have you tried that
Backbone thing by any chance?

29:07.612 --> 29:09.581
[chuckling] Fuck no.

29:09.647 --> 29:11.916
You think I got a death wish?

29:11.983 --> 29:15.053
If I was a younger man,
maybe. But...

29:15.120 --> 29:17.322
Nah, those days
are behind me now.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.257
[chuckling]
I hear you, brother.

29:19.324 --> 29:22.494
I'd give my left wingnut
to claw back a couple
of the good years.

29:22.594 --> 29:23.928
[chuckling]
Yeah, when it was good,

29:23.995 --> 29:25.797
it was really fucking good,
wasn't it?

29:25.897 --> 29:27.999
Oh, yeah.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.934
Oh, man.

29:30.001 --> 29:32.403
When I was
at the top of my game

29:32.470 --> 29:35.106
and I saw something I wanted,

29:35.173 --> 29:38.243
I just took it.
No questions asked.

29:38.309 --> 29:40.645
Same here.
I was a shitty asshole,

29:40.745 --> 29:44.315
but I was the best
goddamn shitty asshole
there ever was.

29:44.415 --> 29:46.684
I had everything!

29:46.785 --> 29:49.521
Then one day, boom.

29:49.621 --> 29:50.755
Boom.

29:51.923 --> 29:53.691
Nothin'.

29:53.792 --> 29:56.361
-Best years of my life...
-Gone.

29:56.461 --> 29:59.030
Thought maybe, just maybe,

29:59.130 --> 30:01.833
I might be able to crawl out
from under the wreckage,

30:01.933 --> 30:04.769
put a few of the broken pieces
back together.

30:04.836 --> 30:06.838
But lately, uh...

30:06.938 --> 30:07.972
I don't know.

30:08.606 --> 30:10.041
Time, man.

30:10.141 --> 30:12.177
It's a real kick in the ass,
ain't it?

30:12.277 --> 30:13.478
Yeah.

30:15.146 --> 30:17.849
-Fuckin' Niles Caulder!
-Fuckin' Niles Caulder.

30:17.949 --> 30:20.952
-That fucking guy.
-That fucking guy!

30:21.019 --> 30:23.688
-What did he do to you?
-Oh, nothing.

30:23.788 --> 30:26.057
I just had this whole
bright future ahead of me,

30:26.157 --> 30:28.393
and that fucking guy
blew it the fuck up.

30:28.493 --> 30:31.062
Yep, that sounds
like fucking Niles.

30:31.162 --> 30:32.397
[sighs]

30:34.666 --> 30:38.336
Well, we're better men now,
I guess.

30:38.403 --> 30:40.071
Yeah, I guess.

30:40.171 --> 30:44.075
Yeah. There comes a time
where you just gotta
give in to your fate

30:44.175 --> 30:45.410
and say, "Fuck it."

30:45.510 --> 30:47.212
You know what I mean?

30:47.312 --> 30:49.681
Um... sure.

30:51.516 --> 30:52.984
See you around, Cliff.

30:53.051 --> 30:55.420
Yeah. See ya.

30:55.520 --> 30:56.855
[door opens]

30:56.921 --> 30:59.390
-[slow song playing]
-[all slurping]

31:15.673 --> 31:18.610
[all slurping]

31:18.710 --> 31:20.511
-God, I miss alcohol.
-[Rita] Ugh.

31:20.578 --> 31:23.381
Are we sure
there's actually any in here?

31:23.448 --> 31:26.951
Or is it just some mystery mix
of red and blue sugar water?

31:27.051 --> 31:28.219
I don't know, Rita.

31:28.286 --> 31:29.687
Why don't I
go get the mixologist

31:29.754 --> 31:31.623
and ask her
which top-shelf booze she used

31:31.723 --> 31:34.025
to make our $6 scorpion bowl?

31:34.092 --> 31:35.193
This place blows.

31:35.260 --> 31:37.228
[dramatic orchestral music]

31:38.730 --> 31:42.267
[Samuelson] Behold!
Garguax the Decimator.

31:42.367 --> 31:45.570
Eater of worlds.
Annihilator of Zortain.

31:45.637 --> 31:49.107
-Raider of the seven galaxy--
-[Victrola stops]

31:51.609 --> 31:54.946
What in the ever-loving fuck?

31:55.046 --> 31:57.115
[Rita] What is it?
What's going on?

31:58.750 --> 32:00.952
-Hey, Cliff.
-Hey, Garg.

32:02.820 --> 32:05.290
Um, who the hell is that?

32:05.390 --> 32:08.559
Who? Garguax?
Oh, he's my new resort buddy.

32:08.626 --> 32:10.662
Nice guy.
You know, you always realize

32:10.762 --> 32:13.164
what a small world it is
when you go on vacation.

32:13.264 --> 32:17.435
Turns out
he hates Niles' fucking guts
as much as we do.

32:17.502 --> 32:19.837
-What are the odds?
-Wait, wait. He knew Niles?

32:19.938 --> 32:21.472
Guess so.

32:23.474 --> 32:26.945
My Lord, who are those guests?

32:27.011 --> 32:28.980
[Garguax] I don't know
who the other ones are,

32:29.080 --> 32:30.815
but, uh,
the robot guy is Cliff.

32:30.915 --> 32:32.750
He's good people.

32:32.817 --> 32:36.654
There are meta-humans
staying at this resort?

32:36.754 --> 32:37.956
Don't know.

32:42.627 --> 32:45.863
Anyone else think
there's some kind of cause
for concern here?

32:45.964 --> 32:49.434
[Rita] I'll ask again.
What is going on?

32:49.500 --> 32:55.940
Well, a red alien guy
just called a green alien guy

32:56.007 --> 32:59.210
"Garguax the Decimator."
So not much.

32:59.310 --> 33:01.512
-Are they supervillains?
-What?

33:01.612 --> 33:02.714
No!

33:02.814 --> 33:04.449
It's probably
just a dumb nickname.

33:04.515 --> 33:06.884
[chuckles sarcastically]
Oh. Yeah.

33:06.985 --> 33:10.121
He probably just picked it up
at his freshman year
at Dartmouth.

33:12.690 --> 33:14.459
So we're really just
gonna sit here?

33:14.525 --> 33:16.227
Look, even if the guy's
a supervillain,

33:16.327 --> 33:19.330
which he's not,
he's clearly on vacation.

33:19.397 --> 33:21.332
[Jane] Yeah, or retired.

33:21.399 --> 33:25.236
So why don't we let
low-budget Shrek and his buddy
eat in peace, yeah?

33:25.336 --> 33:28.673
[Rita] If you're looking to me
for backup, Victor,
don't bother.

33:28.740 --> 33:31.175
My buzz is finally kicking in.

33:35.913 --> 33:36.848
No.

33:38.149 --> 33:39.484
Hey, fellas.

33:40.585 --> 33:42.053
I'm Cyborg.

33:43.354 --> 33:44.689
[chuckles]

33:46.557 --> 33:48.226
On our home planet,

33:48.326 --> 33:51.229
that word, "Cyborg,"
means "Fish fucker."

33:51.329 --> 33:53.731
[chuckles] I'm sorry,
do we have a problem here?

33:53.831 --> 33:56.267
There's no problem here,
Mr. Cyborg.

33:56.367 --> 33:58.770
We're just trying to enjoy
our vacation.

34:00.605 --> 34:03.241
-That's all I'm askin'.
-That's all I'm askin'.

34:03.341 --> 34:06.511
Okay. Thank you, Columbo.
Now...

34:06.577 --> 34:07.845
[sighs softly]

34:13.518 --> 34:15.053
I'll leave you fellas to it.

34:26.397 --> 34:29.100
[exhales] We worked it out.

34:30.068 --> 34:31.903
Our hero.

34:31.969 --> 34:33.471
[slurping]

34:48.786 --> 34:52.757
[scoffs] That guy said
Garguax eats worlds.

34:54.058 --> 34:55.893
I really think
we should do something.

34:55.960 --> 34:59.097
[Rita] I'm confused.
I could've sworn you said
you worked it out.

34:59.163 --> 35:01.499
[Vic] Come on. This is a layup.

35:01.599 --> 35:04.669
Taking this guy on
is the lowest possible
superteam bar we can clear.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.838
Not a superteam, Blue Steel.

35:06.938 --> 35:09.307
-[Cliff] Yeah, Old Blue Eyes.
-[Jane] Yeah,
Blue Light Special.

35:09.407 --> 35:10.842
[chuckles] Nice.

35:10.942 --> 35:13.344
[Cliff] Not for nothing,
but maybe
you shouldn't be judging

35:13.444 --> 35:15.346
who is and who isn't a villain.

35:15.446 --> 35:18.616
If you were willing
to look the other way
for your girlfriend,

35:18.683 --> 35:19.584
why not this guy?

35:19.650 --> 35:21.119
Leave her out of this.

35:21.185 --> 35:22.453
-Just sayin'.
-[Vic] You said it
yourself, Cliff.

35:22.520 --> 35:24.088
Garguax was an enemy of Niles.

35:24.155 --> 35:27.191
-We should do this for him.
-[Cliff laughs]

35:27.291 --> 35:29.026
You got it twisted, Blue Balls.

35:29.127 --> 35:32.096
The enemy of my enemy
is my friend.

35:32.163 --> 35:34.765
If that guy hates Niles,
that's all I need to know.

35:34.832 --> 35:38.336
[Rita] Why don't we all
just take a breath and relax?

35:38.436 --> 35:40.204
We're on vacation.

35:40.304 --> 35:42.673
[scoffs] A vacation for what?

35:42.773 --> 35:45.109
Look, a vacation implies
you actually have a job

35:45.176 --> 35:46.611
that you need
to take a break from.

35:46.677 --> 35:48.479
We don't do anything.

35:48.546 --> 35:49.981
[Rita] That's not true.

35:50.047 --> 35:52.884
[chuckles] I'm sorry, I forgot.

35:55.353 --> 35:59.056
So, uh, is this
how the Beekeeper
would handle the situation?

36:03.861 --> 36:06.697
[Rita] Apparently so.

36:06.797 --> 36:08.900
Looking the other way
is what I do best.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.037
Add the Chief's faith in me
to the list of his many faults.

36:13.137 --> 36:15.840
He foolishly believed
I was destined for heroism,

36:15.907 --> 36:20.711
but when the call to action
actually came,
I promptly hung up.

36:20.811 --> 36:22.680
What are you talking about,
sad sack?

36:22.747 --> 36:24.515
What happened?

36:24.582 --> 36:26.317
[Rita] Niles left me a key
to a secret compartment
in the manor.

36:26.384 --> 36:29.420
Last night,
a strange device was emitting

36:29.520 --> 36:32.089
some kind of
unbearably vexing signal.

36:32.190 --> 36:33.724
I can't be sure
what it was,

36:33.824 --> 36:36.427
but it's entirely possible
someone was in need of help.

36:36.527 --> 36:38.095
And you didn't say anything?

36:38.196 --> 36:40.765
[Rita] No, Victor,
I didn't say anything.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.433
I didn't do anything.

36:42.533 --> 36:45.703
I did the exact opposite
of what a hero
is supposed to do!

36:45.770 --> 36:47.338
I came on vacation.

36:51.209 --> 36:53.778
If I'm going to be honest
with myself,

36:53.878 --> 36:57.748
[sighs] then I should
at least get to be myself.

36:57.848 --> 36:59.016
[sighs deeply]

37:02.053 --> 37:03.754
I'm no hero.

37:03.854 --> 37:06.023
[slurps]

37:06.090 --> 37:08.859
The Beekeeper was yet another
mediocre role

37:08.926 --> 37:12.263
I played to middling reviews.

37:12.363 --> 37:15.299
Another pathetic attempt
at relevance in a world

37:15.399 --> 37:17.935
that would
sooner see me forgotten.

37:19.604 --> 37:23.741
[breath trembling]
A quiet obscurity

37:23.808 --> 37:27.144
worked well enough for decades.
I mean...

37:27.245 --> 37:31.649
Perhaps it's time
I returned to what I know.

37:31.749 --> 37:33.150
You did nothing wrong.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.585
How can you say that?

37:37.722 --> 37:41.092
Not a superteam.

37:42.226 --> 37:44.128
Maybe we
should leave stuff like this

37:44.228 --> 37:46.497
to the people who
are actually equipped
to deal with it.

37:46.597 --> 37:47.898
That's us!

37:47.965 --> 37:49.100
Look at me.

37:49.166 --> 37:51.502
I'm literally equipped
to deal with it!

37:51.602 --> 37:53.571
-Not anymore.
-You know what, Cliff--

37:53.638 --> 37:55.006
[Cliff] How about
you take a break

37:55.106 --> 37:57.908
from the hero shtick, Cyborg,
and just be?

37:57.975 --> 37:59.443
For a minute!

37:59.510 --> 38:01.312
-That's why we all
came here, right?
-[Jane slurps]

38:01.412 --> 38:03.014
You all got your own shit
to deal with.

38:03.114 --> 38:04.348
I got my own shit to deal with.

38:04.448 --> 38:05.583
You mean "avoid."

38:05.650 --> 38:07.151
Oh, fuck all the way off, dude.

38:07.251 --> 38:09.186
What is he talking about?

38:09.287 --> 38:10.755
You wanna tell 'em or should I?

38:12.456 --> 38:14.125
Okay, I'll tell 'em.

38:14.191 --> 38:18.129
Cliff has a brain issue
and he won't
do anything about it.

38:21.032 --> 38:25.136
-Are you okay?
-Will everybody stop
fucking asking me that?

38:25.202 --> 38:27.705
I'm fine, okay? I'm fine!

38:27.805 --> 38:29.607
And before you ask, no!

38:29.674 --> 38:31.375
I'm not gonna
get it checked out.

38:31.475 --> 38:34.145
Even if I wanted to,
who's gonna do it?

38:34.211 --> 38:35.846
The one guy
who might have known

38:35.946 --> 38:38.149
how to help me is dead,
remember?

38:38.215 --> 38:40.217
Niles is fucking dead!

38:40.318 --> 38:45.690
He stuck my fucked up brain
in this fucked up body,
and now he's worm food!

38:45.790 --> 38:48.326
And you want me
to do this for him?

38:48.392 --> 38:52.296
Fuck him! I don't owe him
jack-motherfucking-squat.

38:52.363 --> 38:53.497
None of us do!

38:53.564 --> 38:55.966
So fuck his
little secret compartment

38:56.033 --> 38:57.868
and fuck his
little green nemesis!

38:57.968 --> 39:01.839
His shit is not our shit.
I'm fucking done!

39:07.845 --> 39:09.680
Give it a rest, dude!

39:09.747 --> 39:13.417
Just 'cause you're
in the penalty box,
doesn't make us your plan B.

39:13.517 --> 39:19.690
You wanna be the Chief's
badass crime-fighting
Doom Patrol so badly!

39:19.757 --> 39:22.593
But that's just not who we are.

39:22.693 --> 39:25.229
When are you gonna get that
through your thick metal skull?

39:32.370 --> 39:34.772
[scoffs] Man, screw all y'all.

39:50.187 --> 39:52.423
I knew it. I knew it!

39:52.523 --> 39:56.694
The second I laid eyes
on that bunch,
I knew something was amiss!

39:56.761 --> 39:58.629
This is it, My Lord.

39:58.729 --> 40:01.799
Our time has finally come.

40:01.899 --> 40:04.368
My Lord? What are you doing?

40:05.469 --> 40:06.971
We're done, Samuelson.

40:07.071 --> 40:08.406
It's over.

40:08.472 --> 40:09.974
Over?

40:10.074 --> 40:12.410
You said you heard them talk
of Caulder and his Doom Patrol.

40:12.476 --> 40:15.045
You saw her,
she's finally here.

40:15.112 --> 40:16.414
This is it!

40:16.480 --> 40:19.784
Niles is dead.
And that poor woman's a wreck.

40:19.884 --> 40:22.319
She's not
gonna be harmin' anyone.

40:22.420 --> 40:23.788
Just leave her alone.

40:23.888 --> 40:25.222
"Leave her alone."

40:26.557 --> 40:27.458
"Leave her alone"?

40:27.558 --> 40:30.161
[Samuelson's breath shaking]

40:30.261 --> 40:32.997
More than 70 years
we've waited.

40:33.097 --> 40:36.434
Day after day after day,

40:36.500 --> 40:40.671
and now the moment
we've been waiting
for finally arrives, and...

40:40.771 --> 40:42.773
And you wish to do nothing?

40:42.840 --> 40:44.508
They're nice people.

40:44.608 --> 40:47.645
And clearly
no more beholden to Niles
than we are to the Brain.

40:47.745 --> 40:51.015
-We are beholden to the Brain.
-No.

40:51.115 --> 40:54.351
That thing has never
given us a signal.

40:54.452 --> 40:56.120
And it never will.

40:57.855 --> 41:01.091
Maybe that
was our mission once, but...

41:01.158 --> 41:04.295
missions are supposed to serve
a greater cause.

41:05.429 --> 41:06.864
That cause has long passed.

41:06.964 --> 41:08.999
I can't believe
what I'm hearing.

41:09.099 --> 41:11.368
The Brain's cause
is still our cause.

41:11.469 --> 41:13.170
We cannot give up
on the mission.

41:13.270 --> 41:15.673
We're not giving up
on the mission.

41:17.808 --> 41:19.610
The mission gave up on us.

41:24.548 --> 41:28.352
Thank you for your service,
old friend.

41:29.220 --> 41:31.555
But it's time to move on.

41:31.655 --> 41:34.859
My Lord,
you're not thinking clearly.

41:34.959 --> 41:37.628
My mind hasn't been this clear
in a long time.

41:39.063 --> 41:40.364
Start packing your things.

41:41.465 --> 41:43.000
We leave tonight.

41:45.002 --> 41:47.671
This is a good thing,
Samuelson.

41:47.738 --> 41:50.140
[chuckles softly]
We're finally free.

41:58.582 --> 42:00.351
[Cliff] Fucking Niles.
