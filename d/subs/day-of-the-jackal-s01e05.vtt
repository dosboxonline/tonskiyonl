WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.677
The following programme contains
strong language and violent scenes.

00:16.437 --> 00:17.917
What is the truth?

00:17.917 --> 00:19.957
Do you kill people?
No.

00:19.957 --> 00:21.197
No more lies, please.

00:21.197 --> 00:22.757
No more lies.

00:22.757 --> 00:24.757
My American friend
picked up some chatter.

00:24.757 --> 00:26.357
Rodin price point agreed.

00:26.357 --> 00:27.997
Jackal en route.

00:27.997 --> 00:30.717
A contract's been
taken out on your life.

00:30.717 --> 00:33.757
UDC Who's taken out this contract?
We don't have that information, sir.

00:33.757 --> 00:35.757
Norman definitely knew
we were coming.

00:36.757 --> 00:38.637
Who exactly is this Norman Stoke?

00:38.637 --> 00:41.357
The sniper took the weapon
he used to kill Fest

00:41.357 --> 00:43.357
with him, and this is how he did it.

00:43.357 --> 00:45.637
All thanks to Norman Stoke.
Norman...

00:45.637 --> 00:47.117
...I need an address.

00:47.117 --> 00:48.197
I'll talk to my man.

00:49.677 --> 00:50.997
I want you to see this.

00:53.317 --> 00:55.317
Tell me everything I need to know.
JASMINE Mum!

00:55.317 --> 00:57.197
The Jackal, where is he now?

00:57.197 --> 00:58.317
He should be in Tallinn.

00:58.317 --> 01:00.237
You need to find him
and stay with him.

01:02.077 --> 01:03.557
Hello.

01:50.797 --> 01:52.797
You've taken twenty million dollars
from people

01:52.797 --> 01:54.597
who are used
to getting what they paid for.

01:55.837 --> 01:57.317
And they didn't pay you

01:57.317 --> 01:59.037
to go rogue in Munich.

02:04.277 --> 02:06.437
If I don't deliver, if YOU...

02:06.437 --> 02:08.557
...don't deliver,

02:09.877 --> 02:11.957
they will take extreme measures.

02:13.677 --> 02:16.797
You do not want to make enemies
of these people.

02:16.797 --> 02:18.877
They're more powerful than you know.

02:27.277 --> 02:28.837
If you don't believe me...

02:29.717 --> 02:31.437
...just ask Norman Stoke.

02:37.877 --> 02:40.117
Nobody wants you
to succeed more than me.

02:42.717 --> 02:44.877
I'm a huge admirer of your work.

you can call me.

04:22.837 --> 04:24.157
My phone's secure.

04:25.117 --> 04:26.277

04:27.637 --> 04:28.717
Anything.

05:05.677 --> 05:07.637
You alright?

05:07.637 --> 05:08.917
Great.

05:13.197 --> 05:14.437
Look, Bianca when we...

05:14.437 --> 05:16.077
He tried to kill my daughter.

05:18.197 --> 05:19.397
Fair point.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.357
Outside.

05:24.437 --> 05:25.477
Go on, off you fuck.

05:26.677 --> 05:29.237
No-one comes in. Understood?

05:46.277 --> 05:47.637
Where's Norman?

05:47.637 --> 05:48.837
Fuck you.

05:50.917 --> 05:53.117
Trust me when I say,

05:53.117 --> 05:57.677
I will find Norman
and I will kill him myself.

06:02.157 --> 06:03.717
She ain't fucking about.

06:03.717 --> 06:05.877
We're not police.
We don't need arrest warrants.

06:05.877 --> 06:07.957
She finds him, she's gonna kill him.

06:09.277 --> 06:11.837
Tell us what we need to know...

06:11.837 --> 06:13.837
...and one,

06:15.397 --> 06:17.117
we don't kill Norman.

06:17.117 --> 06:19.637
Two, instead of you

06:19.637 --> 06:22.997
going to prison for life,
the two of you do...

06:22.997 --> 06:25.517
...what, five years max.

06:25.517 --> 06:28.437
Nice, comfy prison. You'll do five
standing on your head, Larry.

06:29.357 --> 06:30.557
And three...

06:30.557 --> 06:32.917
You get to go home

06:32.917 --> 06:37.437
to bury Alison, Emma,
and say your goodbyes.

06:38.717 --> 06:40.437
So, you gonna to speak to me?

06:42.397 --> 06:43.557
No?

06:43.557 --> 06:44.637
Fuck you.

07:36.197 --> 07:38.677
'Congratulations
on your last performance.'

07:38.677 --> 07:42.277
Thank you. It was only made possible
by a very fine instrument.

07:42.277 --> 07:43.797
Made by a maestro.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.477
'Yeah, the best.
That's why I keep coming back.'

07:46.477 --> 07:48.437
'What do you need this time?'

07:48.997 --> 07:51.597
Er, before I get to that, um...

07:52.717 --> 07:54.717
I've got a question for you, Norman.

07:55.437 --> 07:56.517
'Shoot.'

07:58.077 --> 08:00.237
What's been going on with you?

08:05.557 --> 08:07.597
What'd you mean?
'I mean...'

08:07.597 --> 08:12.157
Have you experienced
anything unusual...

08:12.157 --> 08:13.637
'..recently?'

08:14.677 --> 08:18.117
You could say 'unusual', yeah.

08:18.117 --> 08:19.997
'How did you know?'
What exactly?

08:21.197 --> 08:24.517
I need to know before
we can... go any further.

08:26.117 --> 08:28.117
'I was on a business trip.'

08:28.117 --> 08:31.997
Abroad. Some visitors showed up.

08:33.397 --> 08:36.597
They weren't invited
and they weren't bringing flowers.

08:38.237 --> 08:39.237
'Who were they?'

08:41.277 --> 08:42.877
I didn't stop to chat.

08:42.877 --> 08:44.837
'Let's just say I gave 'em
a wee Belfast welcome,

08:44.837 --> 08:46.117
then I got out of there.'

08:46.117 --> 08:48.197
'I dealt with them.'

08:49.717 --> 08:52.557
Right, and you're 100% secure now?

08:52.557 --> 08:53.917
'One hundred percent.'

08:57.237 --> 08:59.157
You know I don't like risks.

08:59.157 --> 09:00.757
'You know I don't either.'

09:08.757 --> 09:11.077
Distance to the target is 75 metres.

09:11.077 --> 09:12.717
'Not like you to get that snug.'

09:12.717 --> 09:15.277
'Yeah.
Unfortunately, it's my only option.'

09:15.277 --> 09:16.917
What are the obstacles?
'A...'

09:16.917 --> 09:19.277
...metal detector
and an ultra-sensitive scanner

09:19.277 --> 09:20.677
but I've got an idea for that.

09:20.677 --> 09:22.237
When you need it?

09:22.877 --> 09:24.717
'Well, the job's in five days.'

09:25.397 --> 09:26.797
There's a problem.

09:26.797 --> 09:28.917
Name your price, old man.
'Nah.'

09:28.917 --> 09:31.797
It's not about the money.
The visitors I mentioned?

09:32.797 --> 09:35.557
I got clipped in the arm.
Can't even wipe my arse properly.

09:35.557 --> 09:38.157
'On my own
I won't make your deadline.'

09:38.157 --> 09:40.397
Well, is there anyone
that can help you?

09:41.237 --> 09:42.317
'No-one I trust.'

09:45.477 --> 09:46.557
Would you trust me?

09:52.357 --> 09:54.157
OK! Stop!

09:55.557 --> 09:56.637
No more!

10:00.997 --> 10:02.197
You won't kill him?

10:02.197 --> 10:03.637
Is that a guarantee?

10:03.637 --> 10:06.117
Cast iron.
Where is he, Larry?

10:06.117 --> 10:07.477
Where's Norman?

10:12.437 --> 10:13.597
Budapest.

10:14.517 --> 10:16.117
Budapest?

10:16.117 --> 10:19.237
What's the address?
I was only there the once.

10:19.237 --> 10:21.277
He picked me up at the airport.
How long did it take

10:21.277 --> 10:23.677
to get from the airport to his
- place?
- I don't know, about an hour?

10:23.677 --> 10:25.277
It was out of town.
Was it a village?

10:25.277 --> 10:27.437
A suburb? What'd it look like?
There, there was a...

10:27.437 --> 10:29.797
...coffee shop at the corner
of Norman's street.

10:29.797 --> 10:32.317
And there were stables
out the back. With horses.

10:32.317 --> 10:33.557
What sort of place has he got?

10:33.557 --> 10:34.637
A house, apartment?

10:34.637 --> 10:37.317
It not a house,
it's a big white building.

10:37.317 --> 10:40.797
With a gate. And a yard.
That's all I know. I swear.

10:40.797 --> 10:42.957
That is all I know!

10:43.717 --> 10:45.437
How'd you find out where I live?

10:47.517 --> 10:49.037
Norman told me.

10:49.037 --> 10:51.077
How did Norman know?

10:51.077 --> 10:53.797
Norman moves in different
circles than me.

10:53.797 --> 10:56.037
He can find stuff out.

11:32.037 --> 11:34.037
'Hi. It's Nuria.'

11:45.477 --> 11:47.037
'A call'

11:47.037 --> 11:51.077
'for all remaining passengers on
flight EST119 flying to Budapest.'

11:51.077 --> 11:53.197
'Please, proceed immediately
to gate five'

11:53.197 --> 11:55.237
'and have your boarding passes
ready.'

11:55.237 --> 11:57.157
So, one of these guys...

11:57.157 --> 12:01.437
...is a dirty little mole...
Yep. Just, give me a minute.

12:10.277 --> 12:12.557
I have an update
on Alexander Duggan.

12:12.557 --> 12:14.157
Uh-huh?

12:14.157 --> 12:18.077
He was a loner. Details freak.
Pure sniper material.

12:18.077 --> 12:21.037
His unit specialised
in eliminating Taliban leaders.

12:21.037 --> 12:22.597
Killed a lot of people.

12:22.597 --> 12:25.637
But they were taken out
by an IED in Helmand in 2013.

12:26.757 --> 12:28.997
So, Duggan is dead?

12:28.997 --> 12:30.637
Yep.

12:30.637 --> 12:32.237
Was his body recovered?

12:32.717 --> 12:34.277
Well, I assume so, but I can check.

12:35.197 --> 12:36.197
Yep.

12:36.877 --> 12:37.877
OK...

12:40.037 --> 12:42.797
Hey, bit of a weird
atmosphere in the office.

12:43.557 --> 12:45.837
Paranoia levels are going through-
Can you...

12:45.837 --> 12:48.277
...get a photograph
of Duggan while you're at it.

12:48.277 --> 12:49.757
Yeah, copy that.
Alright.

12:49.757 --> 12:51.477
I've widened the parameters

12:51.477 --> 12:53.957
to make it
a 90-minute radius from the airport.

12:53.957 --> 12:57.837
He described it as a big, white
building with a gate and a yard.

12:57.837 --> 13:00.477
Coffee shop on the corner
of the street, stables at the back.

13:01.917 --> 13:04.117
How long until we have
a precise location?

13:04.117 --> 13:05.277
It's a little vague.

13:05.277 --> 13:07.557
Might take a while.
Well,

13:07.557 --> 13:10.637
get a move on.
An assassin's on the run.

13:11.717 --> 13:13.757
Right. No pressure then

13:15.117 --> 13:17.237
You haven't given me
much to work with.

13:19.717 --> 13:22.117
'The Thinker or the Stinker?'

13:23.597 --> 13:24.837
Shit.

13:26.637 --> 13:29.957
Rodan is UDC.
The Jackal's next target.

13:31.397 --> 13:33.637
Well,
that certainly raises the stakes.

13:33.637 --> 13:36.717
He's been pissing off
a lot of powerful people.

13:37.557 --> 13:40.157
I assume you've shared this
with Isabel?

13:40.157 --> 13:41.957
You said keep the circle tight.

13:43.677 --> 13:45.517
He knows. We go way back.

13:47.677 --> 13:50.117
Alright. What's your next step?

13:50.117 --> 13:52.957
I need to find Norman Stoke
and we think

13:52.957 --> 13:54.957
we have a rough idea
of where Norman is.

13:54.957 --> 13:56.077
Where?

13:59.397 --> 14:01.317
I get it.

14:01.317 --> 14:03.837
But I'm assuming as soon as you have
a precise location,

14:03.837 --> 14:05.517
you'll want to move quickly
and pick him up?

14:05.517 --> 14:06.677
Yeah, that's the plan.

14:06.677 --> 14:08.957
For which you'll need authorisation
and logistical support.

14:08.957 --> 14:11.997
Apart from Isabel the only person
who can do that, under the radar,

14:11.997 --> 14:13.197
is me.

14:13.197 --> 14:14.477
If I'm to help,

14:14.477 --> 14:16.997
I need the details. Where is he?

14:16.997 --> 14:18.797
Somewhere near Budapest.

14:19.477 --> 14:22.717
We don't know where exactly,
but as soon as we do we can move.

14:23.717 --> 14:25.117
I'll start making arrangements.

14:25.997 --> 14:28.517
When you're ready to roll,
let me know.

14:41.517 --> 14:42.877
Yeah, in your own time.

14:43.757 --> 14:46.077
Been standing here
for the past 20 minutes.

14:46.077 --> 14:47.637
'I know.'

14:47.637 --> 14:49.597
'You're taller than I imagined.'

14:49.597 --> 14:52.517
'And slimmer.'
'OK, where the fuck are you?'

14:52.517 --> 14:55.077
Go to the south-east corner
of the square.

14:55.077 --> 14:56.557
'I'll pick you up.'

15:53.317 --> 15:55.877
'within 90 minutes of the airport.'
Yeah, that's not gonna work.

to narrow it down?'

16:06.037 --> 16:07.197
Nope.

16:08.037 --> 16:11.397
'Alright, we'll see
what else we can come up with.'

16:11.397 --> 16:13.437
Fingers crossed, hey.

16:14.837 --> 16:16.597
Their house is the next left.

16:22.557 --> 16:24.037
Hi, Angela-
D'you have any idea

16:24.037 --> 16:25.837
how much damage you're causing?
Wow.

16:25.837 --> 16:28.237
Straight in. I'm just here
to talk to my husband and my child.

16:28.237 --> 16:29.877
Can you call them, please-
A good mother

16:29.877 --> 16:31.797
wouldn't have to be here.
- A good mother?
- That's enough.

16:31.797 --> 16:33.797
You do NOT want me to comment
on you-I do NOT want...

16:33.797 --> 16:35.357
Angela, go inside.
I'll deal with this.

16:35.357 --> 16:37.877
No-one's trying to speak to you.
I'm trying to talk to my husband...

16:37.877 --> 16:40.477
Please, just go back inside... and
my child! 'I'll deal with this.'

16:40.477 --> 16:42.397
Really?! Please.
Think of it from her point of view.

16:42.397 --> 16:44.797
Why do I need to look at it from her
point of view... Hey! Hey, hey...

16:44.797 --> 16:47.037
...when I'm here to speak to you
and my child and she's chatting-

16:47.037 --> 16:48.757
What happened might be normal
to you, but for us,

16:48.757 --> 16:50.717
it's really fucking scary!
OK. Jasmine, is she there?

16:50.717 --> 16:51.757
What's going on?

16:51.757 --> 16:54.157
She's fine, she's with the boys.
They've been really great with her.

16:54.157 --> 16:55.517
So has Angela.

16:58.957 --> 17:00.277
Are you coming home?

17:00.837 --> 17:03.637
Or are you staying here
with your fucking ex-wife?

17:04.397 --> 17:05.797
Hm?
OK.

17:07.717 --> 17:10.517
From the start, you've been
really upfront with me

17:10.517 --> 17:12.997
about how much you love your job
and how important it is to you, OK?

17:12.997 --> 17:16.557
But last night you brought danger
into our home.

17:16.557 --> 17:19.117
And between that knife being held at
my daughters neck

17:19.117 --> 17:21.317
and that gun you had pointed
in her direction,

17:21.317 --> 17:22.797
Jasmine could've been
fucking killed.

17:22.797 --> 17:25.717
But she wasn't. I dealt with it.
She said you tortured the man.

17:27.117 --> 17:31.677
He had information and
I needed to get it from him.

17:31.677 --> 17:33.677
I don't, I don't even wanna know

17:33.677 --> 17:35.517
what you're saying
with that statement, but...

17:35.517 --> 17:36.917
...either way, Jesus Christ, it's...

17:36.917 --> 17:38.877
It's not really ideal
mothering is it, Bianca?

17:38.877 --> 17:42.757
I am trying, Paul, but
I have a job to do-

17:42.757 --> 17:43.917
We've all got jobs to do!

17:43.917 --> 17:46.117
It's just that some of us
understand that in family,

17:46.117 --> 17:50.037
you've gotta make compromises.
In your job, you can...

17:50.037 --> 17:52.717
...be late for a conference or

17:52.717 --> 17:55.397
bring in a paper late
and it's just...

17:56.437 --> 17:57.877
My job,

17:57.877 --> 18:00.197
if I'm not where they tell me to be,

18:00.197 --> 18:03.197
at the exact time that they tell me
to be there,

18:03.197 --> 18:06.037
then someone dies.

18:06.037 --> 18:07.717
Do you understand?!

18:16.717 --> 18:18.757
I don't recognise you anymore.

19:17.881 --> 19:19.681
Welcome to my humble abode.

20:08.281 --> 20:10.121
Seventy-five metres, you said?

20:10.841 --> 20:11.921
Yeah.

20:11.921 --> 20:13.481
What are the limitations?
Right. So,

20:13.481 --> 20:14.881
main limitation's gonna be size,

20:14.881 --> 20:18.201
so the action and bolt should be
no bulkier than about that.

20:18.201 --> 20:20.721
D'you need a trigger guard?
No, but I was wondering

20:20.721 --> 20:22.801
if I could get the trigger removable
like the last one,

20:22.801 --> 20:25.081
so that I can attach it
just before firing.

20:25.081 --> 20:28.401
- Why?
- Ah, because the whole mechanism

20:28.401 --> 20:29.961
needs to fit into that.

20:33.321 --> 20:35.121
Oh, yes.

20:36.001 --> 20:38.681
That's nice. That's very clever.
Thank you.

20:39.521 --> 20:41.201
And I mentioned the scanner.

20:41.201 --> 20:43.761
And I think that's gonna be
pretty sensitive.

20:44.321 --> 20:47.841
Ah, fracture boots
are made of plastic and polymer.

20:47.841 --> 20:49.521
They'll get
through the scanner easy,

20:49.521 --> 20:53.961
but the... the firing mechanism
and... the barrel,

20:53.961 --> 20:55.121
they're gonna show up.

20:55.121 --> 20:57.961
So, I was wondering about
the whole thing plastic?

20:59.481 --> 21:01.841
Y-You can't make a barrel
out of plastic.

21:01.841 --> 21:06.601
Doesn't matter
if it's machined or 3D printed,

21:06.601 --> 21:08.161
but we could try...

21:08.161 --> 21:13.601
...a low-round-count
disposable barrel made from...

21:13.601 --> 21:14.881
...a lightweight alloy.

21:14.881 --> 21:16.801
Right, and how many rounds
would that get me?

21:16.801 --> 21:18.121
Usually it'll be a...

21:18.121 --> 21:21.721
...one-shot throwaway, but
with a maestro like me,

21:21.721 --> 21:23.721
you can get up to eight shots.

21:23.721 --> 21:25.081
Seven, for sure.

21:25.081 --> 21:26.481
Alright, no, that'll be plenty.

21:26.481 --> 21:27.921
Er, can I get a silencer as well?

21:27.921 --> 21:30.041
We could print the suppressor core.

21:31.041 --> 21:33.321
It would confuse
the... scanner operators.

21:33.321 --> 21:35.761
What we thinking time wise?
Ah, it's gonna takes us

21:35.761 --> 21:37.721
four or five hours
to write the programme

21:37.721 --> 21:40.361
and then... another ten hours
to print.

21:41.681 --> 21:42.801
Do you have time for that?

21:42.801 --> 21:45.121
If we start now, yeah.
Alright, well...

21:45.121 --> 21:49.121
I'm off for a shite,
a shower, and a smoke.

21:49.121 --> 21:50.361
Then I'll be ready.

22:26.161 --> 22:27.441
Right.

22:28.321 --> 22:30.201
Shall we get started?

22:30.201 --> 22:31.641
Let us.

22:31.641 --> 22:33.601
G, nine...

22:33.601 --> 22:35.321
...M, eight, two.

22:35.321 --> 22:37.081
Yeah.

22:37.081 --> 22:38.681
M, one, four, zero.

22:38.681 --> 22:40.841
Yeah.

22:40.841 --> 22:43.521
S, one, four.

23:09.201 --> 23:11.121
That's the printing started.
It'll take...

23:11.121 --> 23:12.841
...ten, twelve hours.

23:16.601 --> 23:18.121
Pain medication.

23:18.121 --> 23:19.441
Yeah, yeah

23:19.441 --> 23:20.681
You have a wee drop?

23:20.681 --> 23:23.281
No, I'm good thank you.
Ah, you might change your mind.

23:27.361 --> 23:28.681
There we go.

23:31.961 --> 23:33.041
Cheers.

23:35.041 --> 23:37.801
Go on then. Well done.

23:46.081 --> 23:47.721
Jesus, look at these glasses.

23:48.521 --> 23:50.761
This place could do
with a woman's touch.

23:53.241 --> 23:54.561
Did you ever have a wife?

23:55.401 --> 23:57.561
A wife?
- Yeah.
- Nah.

23:57.561 --> 24:00.441
Well, once... nearly.

24:00.441 --> 24:03.241
She was a great woman, great cook,

24:03.241 --> 24:04.841
great in bed...

24:04.841 --> 24:06.121
She was great company.

24:07.681 --> 24:10.161
Ah, but sure in... our game...

24:12.281 --> 24:13.601
...you can't have a wife.

24:13.601 --> 24:14.761
You think?

24:14.761 --> 24:16.481
A hundred percent. Especially

24:16.481 --> 24:17.921
if you fall in love with them.

24:18.681 --> 24:21.521
And I was always falling in love.

24:22.801 --> 24:25.881
Fucking nightmare.
I'm a hopeless romantic.

24:25.881 --> 24:28.761
Is that what that trip abroad was?
Was that a romantic thing?

24:28.761 --> 24:31.761
No, no. No. That was...
That was business.

24:31.761 --> 24:35.401
A client with specialist needs,
like you.

24:37.241 --> 24:38.241
Where'd you go?

24:43.281 --> 24:45.321
Client confidentiality.

24:50.641 --> 24:52.241
Where'd you go?

24:59.961 --> 25:02.081
The silence makes me...

25:02.081 --> 25:03.121
...a bit nervous.

25:06.361 --> 25:09.361
It was Belarus... alright?
Does that settle your nerves?

25:09.361 --> 25:12.281
Who came calling for you
in Belarus, Norman? Russians?

25:14.441 --> 25:15.881
They had English accents.

25:17.321 --> 25:18.321
D'you see them?

25:18.321 --> 25:20.921
The bitch who shot me, I saw her
alright, aye-A woman?

25:20.921 --> 25:23.441
Black woman. She had a Glock 17.

25:26.921 --> 25:30.361
A black... armed British woman...

25:30.961 --> 25:32.361
...in Belarus.

25:35.681 --> 25:37.041
You lied to me, old man.

25:37.041 --> 25:38.921
Wh... How am I lying to you?

25:38.921 --> 25:40.641
I'm telling you all about it,
aren't I-

25:40.641 --> 25:43.601
How did you get away from
an MI6 snatch squad, Norman?

25:46.401 --> 25:47.641
I had a bit of help.

25:47.641 --> 25:49.921
Yeah.
I got a tip-off

25:49.921 --> 25:51.801
they were on their way.
Who from?

25:53.801 --> 25:54.801
I don't know.

25:55.641 --> 25:56.801
There was no number...

25:56.801 --> 25:59.761
It was... it was just a message
said, 'Clear out now.'

26:18.761 --> 26:20.601
You're an artist, my friend,

26:20.601 --> 26:22.481
and you've always been discreet.

26:25.161 --> 26:26.681
But if that changes...

27:03.201 --> 27:04.281
Yeah?

27:04.281 --> 27:07.921
'I've got good news. We think
we found Norman's location.'

27:07.921 --> 27:11.041
'It fits all the parameters, an
abandoned factory in a place called'

27:11.041 --> 27:13.441
'Lorinci.'
Are you sure?

27:13.441 --> 27:15.201
'As sure as we can be.'

27:15.201 --> 27:18.721
'Large white building, 56 minutes
from Budapest airport.'

27:18.721 --> 27:20.081
'Right now it's our best shot.'

27:20.081 --> 27:23.161
Osi,
we might have a location.

27:23.161 --> 27:24.481
Do we have authorisation?

27:24.481 --> 27:26.041
'So, it is Budapest?'

27:27.201 --> 27:29.401
Yeah, it's Budapest.
'I'll inform the Hungarians'

27:29.401 --> 27:31.681
'that we're going to be operating
on their turf.'

27:31.681 --> 27:33.881
'You get to the airport,
I'll get the authorisation.'

27:34.961 --> 27:38.081
'If you need anything else,
give me a call.'

27:40.841 --> 27:42.601
Do you trust him?

27:44.201 --> 27:45.281
Do you?

27:58.201 --> 27:59.641
Try it on.

28:09.361 --> 28:11.321
Yeah that's...

28:11.321 --> 28:13.121
...weirdly comfortable.

28:13.121 --> 28:16.121
The scanner will pick up
the metal components,

28:16.121 --> 28:18.041
but that shouldn't surprise
the operator.

28:18.041 --> 28:19.401
If he asks you to take it off,

28:19.401 --> 28:21.801
you can tell him
to fuck off on medical grounds.

28:23.961 --> 28:25.201
Show me how to build it.

29:10.401 --> 29:14.201
That is a fucking work
of art, that is.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.801
So, where's the nearest place
I can take this for a spin

29:17.801 --> 29:22.161
without attracting attention?
Oh, top of the road, turn right.

29:22.161 --> 29:24.681
Left at the train tracks
and keep going

29:24.681 --> 29:26.481
until you get to some woods.
Right.

29:26.481 --> 29:28.841
You can take my car.

29:28.841 --> 29:30.521
I'm off to bed.

29:30.521 --> 29:31.561
Oh.

29:34.121 --> 29:35.961
You'll need these.

29:35.961 --> 29:38.401
Couple of special ones
in there, too.

29:39.201 --> 29:41.161
Remember...

29:41.161 --> 29:43.121
It's not gunmetal.

29:43.121 --> 29:45.481
You'll get eight shots from it.

29:45.481 --> 29:48.561
To be on the safe side,
keep the test firing to a minimum.

29:53.041 --> 29:55.961
'Welcome to Budapest.
The local time is...'

29:55.961 --> 29:59.521
'..01:35. We'd like to
wish you a safe onward journey.'

30:00.321 --> 30:01.601
There he is.

30:19.441 --> 30:21.241
Actually sorry, d'you know what,

30:21.241 --> 30:22.881
can I get the small one?

30:24.001 --> 30:26.241
How much is that?
Two thousand, please.

30:26.241 --> 30:28.281
Two thousand, thank you very much.

33:47.758 --> 33:49.198
Hi...

33:49.198 --> 33:50.758
'..stranger.'

33:51.598 --> 33:52.758
Hello, my love.

33:52.758 --> 33:54.758
Are you alright?

33:56.518 --> 33:58.038
Yes.

33:58.038 --> 33:59.158
'Are you sure?'

34:00.198 --> 34:01.798
'I've been trying you.'

34:01.798 --> 34:03.358
'You sure you're OK?'

34:04.398 --> 34:06.798
'I'm fine. I just...'

34:06.798 --> 34:09.558
'..needed some time to think.'
OK.

34:10.718 --> 34:13.238
Well, all good I'm hoping?
'Yeah, I think so.'

34:18.278 --> 34:22.078
'When are you coming back?'
Four or five days. A week at most.

34:22.838 --> 34:25.758
And then I promise you,
you are gonna be so bored of me,

34:25.758 --> 34:28.038
you're gonna be begging me to leave.

34:28.038 --> 34:30.878
I just want everything to be
the way it used to be.

34:33.958 --> 34:36.238
It's just up here on the left.

34:36.238 --> 34:39.358
How's our little boy
doing?''NURIA: He's great.'

34:39.358 --> 34:42.518
'Exhausting, but great.'
I miss you both so much.

34:43.598 --> 34:45.278
'We miss you, too.'

34:45.278 --> 34:48.318
'But there's something we need
to discuss, Charles.'

34:50.598 --> 34:52.078
'Did you hear me?'
Yeah...

34:58.438 --> 35:00.558
Certainly fits Larry's description.

35:02.678 --> 35:04.958
This is important, Charles.

35:04.958 --> 35:07.758
I've gotta run now, but I'll
speak to you in a sec, OK? Love you.

35:07.758 --> 35:09.118
'Bye.'
Bye, bye.

35:37.038 --> 35:38.438
We can cut the power,

35:38.438 --> 35:40.238
it's all arranged.

35:40.798 --> 35:42.958
I just don't want
a repeat of Belarus.

35:44.078 --> 35:45.678
What d'you wanna do?

35:45.678 --> 35:46.958
It's your call.

36:10.758 --> 36:11.918
Fuck...

36:55.798 --> 36:59.518
Right. Remember we need him alive,
yeah? OK...

37:19.998 --> 37:21.558
'Yeah?'

37:21.558 --> 37:23.118
You've got visitors. One of them

37:23.118 --> 37:26.278
'looks like your friend from MI6.
Clean up and get out now.'

37:26.278 --> 37:28.398
Just make sure you clean up.

37:36.078 --> 37:37.198
Fuck...

37:54.478 --> 37:55.998
Fuck.

38:09.838 --> 38:12.678
OK. Not this one.

38:53.958 --> 38:55.638
Come on, you bastards!

38:58.438 --> 39:00.158
Breaching!

39:03.318 --> 39:05.318
Move!

39:11.878 --> 39:13.118
Fuck off!

39:15.798 --> 39:16.798
Fuck off!

39:21.638 --> 39:22.718
Move!

39:25.358 --> 39:27.358
Fuck.

39:27.358 --> 39:28.638
Fuck.

39:35.318 --> 39:36.758
Hello, Norman.

39:41.158 --> 39:42.198
Hmm...

39:45.798 --> 39:47.158
I know you made the gun

39:47.158 --> 39:48.558
that killed Manfred Fest.

39:48.558 --> 39:51.598
You know fuck all.
And here you are...

39:51.598 --> 39:53.638
...making a new one already, Norman.

39:56.038 --> 39:57.918
Is this for the Jackal as well?

39:57.918 --> 40:00.198
I haven't the foggiest idea
what you're talking about.

40:00.198 --> 40:02.958
Must be impossible
with just the one arm?

40:05.438 --> 40:06.798
Oh, what's all this?

40:08.078 --> 40:10.678
Did you have
a little friend over, Norman?

40:10.678 --> 40:12.318
Well, that makes sense.

40:12.318 --> 40:15.078
You're a pretty sad
specimen on your own, eh?

40:16.638 --> 40:18.038
Fuck you.

40:18.038 --> 40:20.278
Tell us who the Jackal is.

40:21.598 --> 40:25.998
I haven't the foggiest idea
what you're talking about.

40:25.998 --> 40:27.558
Ah, come on Norman...

40:27.558 --> 40:29.318
What's the Jackal's name?

40:31.718 --> 40:34.918
I haven't the foggiest idea
what you're talking about.

40:34.918 --> 40:37.558
Oh, I think you do, Norman.
We know the Jackal's

40:37.558 --> 40:39.318
been contracted for another hit.

40:39.318 --> 40:41.998
Makes sense he'd need another
bespoke weapon.

40:41.998 --> 40:43.958
And after you did such a good job

40:43.958 --> 40:45.798
with the last one.
Well, if it was me,

40:45.798 --> 40:48.438
I'd be hurt if
he didn't ask me for the next one.

40:48.438 --> 40:51.998
This is his. This... This is HIS.

40:51.998 --> 40:54.278
Isn't it, Norman?

40:54.278 --> 40:55.318
Eh?

40:57.238 --> 40:58.878
The Jackal's here, isn't he?

40:58.878 --> 41:01.278
Come on. Let's get him in the car.
No.

41:01.278 --> 41:02.558
Wait.

41:04.038 --> 41:07.518
The Jackal's been here.
His things are here...

41:07.518 --> 41:09.478
...so he'll be back.

41:10.558 --> 41:13.158
Tell Lina and Tamas
to keep watch on the street.

41:14.198 --> 41:16.358
Change of plan. Lina,
stay by the car.

41:16.358 --> 41:18.318
Tamas, take your position.
'Copy.'

41:18.318 --> 41:21.398
Well, while we're waiting, Norman,

41:22.958 --> 41:27.398
you can tell me
how you got my home address.

41:27.398 --> 41:28.678
Hm?

41:29.718 --> 41:33.198
Was it the same person that tipped
you off that we were in Belarus?

41:41.438 --> 41:44.598
I haven't the foggiest idea
what you're talking about.

41:45.918 --> 41:47.758
Huh...

41:48.718 --> 41:51.198
Aren't you wondering
who tipped us off about you?

41:51.198 --> 41:52.318
Huh?

41:53.078 --> 41:55.318
It was Larry.

41:55.318 --> 41:56.758
Yeah, that's right.

41:59.398 --> 42:02.158
Man, it must be really hard,

42:02.158 --> 42:05.838
finding out that it was
your own brother who sold you out.

42:05.838 --> 42:07.438
And it must be even harder,

42:07.438 --> 42:10.038
when the person
standing in front of you

42:10.038 --> 42:13.718
is the one who made him talk,
and is gonna put you both

42:13.718 --> 42:16.838
in jail for the rest
of your fucking lives.

42:19.518 --> 42:21.158
Shooter. Flanking left.

42:35.038 --> 42:37.638
'Does anyone
have eyes on? Can you see him?!'

42:37.638 --> 42:39.878
'Negative.'
'Negative.'

42:52.798 --> 42:54.638
'I have eyes on.
He's by the stables.'

42:56.318 --> 42:58.278
'Copy that. Eyes on.'

43:13.158 --> 43:14.158
Hup!

43:15.198 --> 43:17.918
He's going mobile...
on a fucking horse.

43:19.638 --> 43:20.798
'In pursuit.'

43:21.598 --> 43:22.798
'Lina, pick me up.'

43:22.798 --> 43:25.558
'You didn't tell me
you were after John-fucking-Wayne.'

43:50.438 --> 43:51.438
Go, go, go!

44:24.758 --> 44:26.198
You OK?
Yes.

44:26.198 --> 44:27.598
He hit the vest.

45:13.318 --> 45:14.318
Fuck!

45:56.838 --> 45:59.078
FUCK!

45:59.078 --> 46:00.558
FUCK!
