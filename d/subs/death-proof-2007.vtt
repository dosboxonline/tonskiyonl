WEBVTT

02:55.108 --> 02:56.942
Hold on. I gotta come up.

02:57.026 --> 02:59.279
I gotta take the world's
biggest fucking piss.

02:59.363 --> 03:01.113
We can't be late.

03:01.197 --> 03:02.322
We won't!

03:25.597 --> 03:29.142
- Who's holding?
- If you're not, then nobody.

03:29.226 --> 03:30.851
We were kind of hoping you were.

03:30.935 --> 03:33.520
- Yeah. How are you not holding?
- Jesus Christ, Shanna.

03:33.604 --> 03:36.690
It is not my fucking job to supply
y'all with weed when we go out.

03:36.774 --> 03:39.110
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, little lady.

03:39.194 --> 03:40.945
You're getting angry kind of quick,
don't you think?

03:41.030 --> 03:43.155
- I was just teasing you.
- I'm not angry.

03:43.239 --> 03:46.868
It just would be nice if y'all didn't
just count on me all the fucking time,

03:46.952 --> 03:49.370
and surprise me
every once in a while with pot.

03:49.455 --> 03:52.873
Okay, mean girl in a high school movie.
Are you through having a tantrum?

03:52.957 --> 03:55.168
- I'm not having a tantrum.
- Yes, you are.

03:55.252 --> 03:58.171
You've been in the car all of two seconds,
and you're already cursing at me.

03:58.255 --> 04:03.885
- I am not cursing at you.
- You said, "Jesus Christ, Shanna."

04:03.969 --> 04:05.470
And then,
before the sentence was over,

04:05.554 --> 04:08.181
you threw a "fucking" in there
to emphasize your "irritatance."

04:08.265 --> 04:10.559
All right. Come on, guys. Don't fight.
I'll pay for it when we get some.

04:10.643 --> 04:12.353
One: It is not about the money.

04:12.437 --> 04:14.687
It is about the pain in the ass of scoring.

04:14.772 --> 04:17.565
And two: We're not really fighting.

04:17.649 --> 04:20.694
Arlene, have you forgotten
what hanging out with Jungle Julia's like?

04:20.779 --> 04:21.945
That wasn't a fight.

04:22.029 --> 04:24.781
That was Julia
acting like a grumpy bitch,

04:24.866 --> 04:28.911
and me calling her on it
and indulging her at the same time.

04:28.995 --> 04:31.580
That's how we tolerate each other
after all these years.

04:31.664 --> 04:33.748
Oh, billboard.

04:36.460 --> 04:39.128
So, what's the plan, man?

04:39.213 --> 04:41.215
Margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's.

04:41.299 --> 04:43.175
Did you call Rafael
and tell him we're coming?

04:43.259 --> 04:44.467
- Of course.
- You're so good.

04:44.551 --> 04:45.968
I know.

04:46.053 --> 04:48.764
Okay, is Christian Simonson
gonna be there?

04:48.848 --> 04:51.058
You bet your ass he is.
He's gonna be there with Jesse Letterman.

04:51.142 --> 04:54.143
Christian Simonson,
the filmmaker, is in town.

04:54.228 --> 04:56.479
He's got a big thing for Julia.

04:56.564 --> 04:58.440
If he had a big thing for me,
he'd fucking call me

04:58.525 --> 04:59.900
as opposed to disappearing
for six months,

04:59.984 --> 05:02.111
and he'd get his ass down here
more often than he does,

05:02.195 --> 05:04.822
and on my birthday,
give me a fucking phone call.

05:04.906 --> 05:06.323
Oh, billboard.

05:13.541 --> 05:17.918
Yeah, but you get those legs
of yours around him, and it's all over.

05:18.002 --> 05:19.962
Yeah, well, when I'm redecorating
his house in the hills

05:20.046 --> 05:22.757
that I am also living in,
I'll let you know it worked.

05:22.842 --> 05:26.427
So, margaritas and Mexican food at Guero's,
touch base with Chris and Jesse,

05:26.511 --> 05:29.722
tell them about later,
and make damn sure they come.

05:29.807 --> 05:32.892
Those other guys will be waiting for us
to join them at the Texas Chili Parlor.

05:32.977 --> 05:34.436
Oh, shit.

05:34.520 --> 05:38.105
Speaking of which, what happened
with you and Nate last night?

05:38.189 --> 05:40.899
Well, you know, not mu --
We just fucking met each other.

05:40.984 --> 05:42.620
I mean, if you don't
bust their balls a

05:42.633 --> 05:44.279
little bit, they're never
gonna respect you.

05:44.363 --> 05:46.488
Okay, we're pretty clear
on what it is you didn't do.

05:46.573 --> 05:48.949
How about enlightening us
on what it is you did do?

05:49.033 --> 05:50.742
Nothing to write home about.

05:50.827 --> 05:52.996
We just made out on the couch
for about 20 minutes.

05:53.080 --> 05:54.664
Dressed, half-dressed or naked?

05:54.748 --> 05:56.207
Dressed. I said we made out.

05:56.292 --> 05:58.041
We didn't do the thing.

05:58.126 --> 06:01.296
Excuse me for living,
but what is "the thing"?

06:01.380 --> 06:03.173
You know, it's everything but.

06:03.257 --> 06:04.674
They call it "the thing"?

06:04.758 --> 06:06.718
I call it "the thing."

06:06.802 --> 06:08.511
Do guys like the thing?

06:08.596 --> 06:10.972
They like it better than no thing.

06:12.099 --> 06:14.309
Okay, I wanna get back
to what it is you did do.

06:14.393 --> 06:16.479
So, you're making out
on the couch with Nate, right?

06:16.563 --> 06:17.562
- Correct.
- Whose couch?

06:17.646 --> 06:21.733
- His or the one in your hotel room?
- What am I, stupid over here? Mine.

06:21.817 --> 06:23.485
Were you making out
sitting up or lying down?

06:23.569 --> 06:26.322
We started sitting up.
We worked our way to lying down.

06:26.406 --> 06:29.032
Mmm, the plot thickens.
Who was on top?

06:29.116 --> 06:31.493
I was straddling him.

06:31.577 --> 06:33.579
- What else?
- That was it.

06:33.663 --> 06:35.915
So we made out
for a little while on the couch,

06:35.999 --> 06:40.710
and I said, "Okay, I'm gonna go to bed now,
so it's time for you to leave."

06:40.794 --> 06:43.338
And then he starts to whine,
"Oh, right now?"

06:43.422 --> 06:46.508
And I said, "Yep, right now.
Let's go."

06:46.592 --> 06:48.219
And he says,
"well, wait. what about this?"

06:48.303 --> 06:49.344
And I said, "No."

06:49.428 --> 06:51.721
He said, "What do you mean, no?
You don't even know what I'm gonna say."

06:51.805 --> 06:53.264
I said, "I already know
what you're gonna say,

06:53.349 --> 06:54.641
and the answer's no."

06:54.725 --> 06:56.560
He said, "How can you say
you know what I'm gonna say?"

06:56.645 --> 06:58.854
I said, "Because you're gonna say,
'let's just go to sleep together.

06:58.939 --> 07:00.313
"'We don't gotta do nothing.

07:00.397 --> 07:04.318
"'Just cuddle, sleep next to each other,
wake up in the morning together.'

07:04.402 --> 07:07.363
No, you're gonna leave,
but I'll see you tomorrow."

07:07.447 --> 07:08.989
Yeah, fuck Nate.

07:09.074 --> 07:10.156
I mean, he's cute and all,

07:10.241 --> 07:12.243
but Jesse Letterman's
gonna be all over her.

07:12.327 --> 07:16.830
- Jesse Letterman --
- Remember, no hooking up tonight.

07:16.915 --> 07:20.209
You can hang out with him,
you can make out with him,

07:20.293 --> 07:25.673
but no hooking up with him,
because we are driving to Lake LBJ tonight,

07:25.757 --> 07:28.009
and my daddy's pretty clear
about one thing.

07:28.094 --> 07:32.972
He said, "I am letting you
and your girlfriends stay at my lake house,

07:33.056 --> 07:37.018
not you and a bunch of horny boys trying
to get their fuck on with my daughter."

07:37.103 --> 07:40.021
- Your dad talks like that?
- Hell, yeah!

07:40.106 --> 07:41.814
It's not like he ain't gonna know, either,

07:41.898 --> 07:45.776
because when I'm staying at the lake house
with my girlfriends in our bikinis,

07:45.860 --> 07:49.446
Daddy just has a tendency to pop up
and make sure we don't need anything.

07:51.408 --> 07:54.952
Look, he's totally harmless
and cute as a bug's ear.

07:55.036 --> 07:57.705
But, you know, when he's got
a bunch of half-naked poontang

07:57.789 --> 07:59.874
walking the floor of his lake house,

07:59.959 --> 08:03.127
he just likes to pay us a visit
and make sure we got everything we need.

08:03.211 --> 08:07.632
And if you flirt shamelessly with him, like
the six-foot baby giraffe in the backseat,

08:07.717 --> 08:09.551
you got a puppy dog for life.

08:09.635 --> 08:11.428
I have my own relationship
with Ben,

08:11.512 --> 08:13.429
and you're just jealous
'cause it don't include you.

08:13.513 --> 08:16.891
- You call her dad Ben?
- I'm not a child. That's his name.

08:16.976 --> 08:19.185
So when are the boys showing up?

08:19.270 --> 08:21.438
They're gonna meet us
at the Chili Parlor.

08:21.522 --> 08:22.813
Maybe they can bring some pot.

08:22.898 --> 08:24.441
Fuck that. No.

08:24.525 --> 08:26.943
I don't wanna be either
A, depending on their fucking ass,

08:27.028 --> 08:28.612
or B, depending on their ass.

08:28.696 --> 08:29.821
Uh-uh. We don't score ourselves,

08:29.905 --> 08:32.198
we're gonna be stuck
with them all fucking night.

08:32.284 --> 08:34.451
Ooh, try Lanna Frank.

08:34.534 --> 08:36.160
Best idea you had all day.

08:36.245 --> 08:39.789
Oh, hey, that's your last billboard
before Guero's.

08:39.875 --> 08:41.333
Oh, come on.
Give me a break.

08:41.418 --> 08:44.001
"Oh, come on," my ass!
We said every time.

08:44.086 --> 08:46.379
Okay.

08:59.727 --> 09:02.647
Jules, let me get a drag?
Thanks.

09:31.885 --> 09:34.846
Oh, my God!

09:34.931 --> 09:37.765
Hey, this is --
and I's U.T. days, Arlene.

09:37.849 --> 09:38.849
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:38.934 --> 09:41.519
- You wanna join us?
- For a second, but I'm with some friends.

09:41.603 --> 09:43.647
Oh.

09:43.731 --> 09:45.773
So you must be -- must be --

09:45.857 --> 09:48.734
So you must be the infamous Butterfly.

09:48.819 --> 09:49.944
Shh!

09:50.028 --> 09:51.904
She don't know nothing about it.

09:51.988 --> 09:53.823
- Know about what?
- When were y'all gonna tell her?

09:53.907 --> 09:54.990
- Soon.
- Tell me what?

09:55.075 --> 09:57.742
Yeah, now thanks to you,
we gotta tell her sooner than later.

09:57.827 --> 09:59.495
All right, cut the shit.
What the fuck is going on?

09:59.579 --> 10:02.206
I said a little somethin'-somethin'
about you on the air today.

10:02.290 --> 10:04.709
Julia, what the fuck did you say
about me on the radio?

10:04.793 --> 10:08.337
All I said was I had
a sexy friend named Butterfly

10:08.422 --> 10:10.256
who was in from out of town
for the weekend,

10:10.340 --> 10:13.008
and we would be going out
somewhere in Austin tonight,

10:13.093 --> 10:15.554
and if they were out on the town,
maybe they'd see us.

10:15.638 --> 10:20.558
And I described you, and I said
that if they spotted you while we were out,

10:20.642 --> 10:23.103
if they'd do something,
you'd do something.

10:23.187 --> 10:24.563
Okay, now, Julia, I'm serious.

10:24.647 --> 10:27.231
what did you say,
and what did you say I'd do?

10:27.315 --> 10:31.236
Anyhoo, I could explain what I said,
which would be boring,

10:31.320 --> 10:33.572
or Marcy over here,

10:33.656 --> 10:36.199
who is an incredible actress,
could act it out for you,

10:36.284 --> 10:38.368
which, I think,
will give you a better idea

10:38.453 --> 10:40.370
of what you have in store
for you tonight.

10:40.455 --> 10:42.497
Okay, so just tell me your way.

10:42.582 --> 10:44.583
- So we'll act it out with Marcy?
- Sure.

10:44.667 --> 10:46.794
Okay, give Marcy your drink.

10:46.879 --> 10:48.336
Thank you.

10:48.421 --> 10:51.965
Okay, so, you're in a club or a bar,

10:52.049 --> 10:54.801
and Marcy's a kind of cute
or kind of hot or kind of sexy

10:54.886 --> 10:58.096
or better be fucking hysterically funny,
but not funny-looking guy

10:58.181 --> 10:59.889
who you could fuck.

10:59.973 --> 11:02.350
- Got it.
- Okay, Marcy, take it.

11:11.486 --> 11:12.569
Howdy.

11:12.653 --> 11:14.905
Hi there.

11:16.157 --> 11:20.368
Excuse me, but your name
wouldn't be Butterfly, would it?

11:20.453 --> 11:23.789
Yes, it is. It seems you have me
at a disadvantage.

11:23.873 --> 11:25.332
Barry.

11:25.416 --> 11:27.543
Pleased to meet you, Barry.

11:27.628 --> 11:29.711
- Y'all are getting me hot.
- Shh!

11:33.467 --> 11:37.094
So, is, uh, Butterfly your real name?

11:37.179 --> 11:38.971
Yes, it is.

11:39.056 --> 11:40.889
And how'd you know my name, Barry?

11:40.973 --> 11:43.810
I listened to Jungle Julia's show
this morning.

11:43.894 --> 11:45.561
Oh, you did, did you?

11:45.646 --> 11:47.396
Oh, yeah. I listen to her show
every morning.

11:47.481 --> 11:49.566
Oh, you do, do you?

11:49.651 --> 11:52.568
Yeah. She's, like,
the coolest lady in town.

11:52.653 --> 11:55.112
Don't you think she's got a big ass?

11:55.197 --> 11:56.823
Nah, man.

11:56.907 --> 11:58.658
I like her ass that way.

11:58.742 --> 12:01.368
She got a black girl's ass.

12:01.452 --> 12:03.537
Well, that's what she always says,
but, natural fact,

12:03.621 --> 12:05.665
she doesn't really have
a black girl's ass.

12:05.749 --> 12:08.835
- She's got a big ass.
- Okay, what the fuck are you doing?

12:08.919 --> 12:11.295
Oh, look who wants to get
to the point all of a sudden.

12:11.379 --> 12:12.462
Okay, we'll get to the point.

12:12.547 --> 12:14.382
But for your information,
skinny bitch,

12:14.466 --> 12:17.301
black men and a whole lot
of motherfucking white men

12:17.386 --> 12:20.179
have had plenty fun
adoring my ass.

12:20.264 --> 12:23.057
I don't wear their teeth marks
on my butt for nothing.

12:23.141 --> 12:25.518
All right, if you're not gonna
buy me a drink, can I have mine back?

12:25.602 --> 12:28.020
No. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

12:28.105 --> 12:31.233
So, Butterfly,
can I buy you a drink?

12:31.317 --> 12:33.401
- I'd love one.
- What can I get you?

12:33.485 --> 12:35.069
I'll take a margarita.

12:35.153 --> 12:37.531
Here you go.

12:38.908 --> 12:40.868
So, after they buy you a drink,

12:40.952 --> 12:43.703
when they raise their glass to toast,

12:43.787 --> 12:45.914
they look you dead in the eye

12:45.999 --> 12:48.667
and repeat this poem:

12:48.751 --> 12:52.881
"The woods are lovely,
dark and deep,

12:52.964 --> 12:58.010
"and I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep.

12:58.094 --> 12:59.970
"Did you hear me, Butterfly?

13:00.054 --> 13:03.223
Miles to go before you sleep."

13:03.308 --> 13:07.059
And then, if they say that ...

13:08.145 --> 13:09.771
you gotta give them a lap dance.

13:09.898 --> 13:10.981
What?

13:11.065 --> 13:12.941
If they call you Butterfly,
buy you a drink,

13:13.026 --> 13:15.109
repeat that poem,
you gotta give them a lap dance.

13:15.193 --> 13:17.070
That's bullshit.
I ain't giving them nothing.

13:17.155 --> 13:18.906
well, you can do it or not,
but if you don't,

13:18.990 --> 13:20.657
everybody in Austin's
gonna think you're a chickenshit.

13:20.742 --> 13:23.911
And I don't think you want everybody
in Austin thinking you're a chickenshit.

13:23.995 --> 13:26.747
I ain't giving nobody no lap dance
'cause of what you said.

13:26.831 --> 13:28.165
Oh, come on.
It's gonna be funny.

13:28.249 --> 13:31.001
Yeah, everything's funny to you two
when it's happening to me.

13:31.085 --> 13:34.547
Look, you don't have to do it
for anybody you don't want.

13:34.631 --> 13:36.715
I said you'd do it
for the first guy who says it.

13:36.799 --> 13:39.760
So, some geek comes over,
trying to be cool,

13:39.844 --> 13:42.680
just tell him you already did it
at another place earlier.

13:42.765 --> 13:46.350
No harm, no foul,
but you get a free drink out of it.

13:46.434 --> 13:48.978
But maybe a little later
in the evening,

13:49.063 --> 13:52.774
you've had a few drinks,
you're kind of loosey-goosey,

13:52.858 --> 13:54.943
you're safe with your girls,

13:55.027 --> 13:58.780
then some kind of cute, kind of hot,
kind of sexy, hysterically funny,

13:58.864 --> 14:01.783
but not funny-looking guy
comes up and says it,

14:01.867 --> 14:05.370
then maybe you did it earlier,
maybe you didn't.

14:10.833 --> 14:13.419
You made me trip.

14:13.504 --> 14:17.214
You made me trip,
you dumb bitch!

14:17.966 --> 14:19.841

16:16.795 --> 16:19.798
That's a good fucking question.

16:30.101 --> 16:32.142
Lanna Frank!

16:32.227 --> 16:33.560
Where are you?

16:35.523 --> 16:37.857
well, come over already.
We're waiting for you.

16:37.942 --> 16:40.151
Shit!

16:40.236 --> 16:42.111
Hold on!

16:53.541 --> 16:56.126
So where are you?

16:56.210 --> 16:59.130
Come over already.
We're waiting for you.

16:59.214 --> 17:01.257
No, we're not coming over there.

17:01.341 --> 17:04.342
You come over here
like you said you would.

17:04.425 --> 17:07.429
So, is it "Shawna" and the girls
at the lake house this weekend?

17:07.513 --> 17:09.890
- "Shawna"?
- Oh, fuck! I --

17:09.974 --> 17:14.227
No. Now, there is one thing
that every girl in the whole world

17:14.310 --> 17:17.188
whose name is Shanna
has in common with each other,

17:17.272 --> 17:18.565
we all hate the name Shawna,

17:18.648 --> 17:20.983
and we really hate it
when people call us Shawna.

17:58.190 --> 18:02.444
Just remember, it's Shanna
Banana, not Shawna Banawna.

18:02.528 --> 18:05.571
Okay, but at some point in the evening,
I had fuckability stock.

18:05.655 --> 18:07.198
Yeah. I mean ...

18:07.282 --> 18:09.867
it wasn't bullish, but ...

18:35.686 --> 18:38.312
Okay, Warren's sending over shots.

18:38.396 --> 18:39.939
And you know the house rule:

18:40.023 --> 18:42.442
If he sends over shots,
you've gotta do them.

18:42.526 --> 18:44.986
- What?
- Hey, them's the rules, baby.

18:45.071 --> 18:46.780
Warren says it, we do it!

18:46.864 --> 18:51.034
I love that philosophy:
"Warren says it, we do it."

18:51.118 --> 18:54.246
- So let's do it!
- What is it?

18:54.330 --> 18:56.248
Hey, shot first, questions later.

18:56.332 --> 18:59.084
Here we go! Post time!

18:59.168 --> 19:00.585
Mmm!

19:03.005 --> 19:05.257
Whoo-hoo!

19:05.341 --> 19:06.801
Ow!

19:08.552 --> 19:12.013
Now, is that a tasty beverage
or is that a tasty beverage?

19:12.098 --> 19:13.473
What the fuck is it?

19:13.557 --> 19:18.520
Chartreuse, the only liquor so good,
they named a color after it.

19:20.356 --> 19:22.065
Who's down for dos Chartreuse?

19:22.149 --> 19:24.317
Not me.

19:24.402 --> 19:26.486
- I'm going out for a smoke.
- Okay.

19:26.570 --> 19:28.904
But careful where you keep
that hot flame, all right?

19:28.989 --> 19:30.615
You'll blow up the joint.

19:43.379 --> 19:46.007
Drinks. What can I get you?
Shanna Banana?

19:46.091 --> 19:48.676

20:55.410 --> 20:58.205
You scared the fuck
out of me, you shitty asshole!

20:58.289 --> 21:00.957
I swear, Arlene,
I was not trying to scare you.

21:01.042 --> 21:02.708
I just got lucky.

21:02.793 --> 21:05.587
Oh, hardy-fucking-har.
Go inside.

21:05.671 --> 21:07.381
- Wait a minute.
- Why?

21:07.465 --> 21:10.008
- I was thinking we could make out.
- What, on a porch?

21:10.093 --> 21:11.885
Not even in the bar,
but in front of the entrance?

21:11.969 --> 21:14.221
- Forget it.
- No, in my car.

21:14.305 --> 21:16.681
What, out there?
It's wet as fucking 'Nam out there.

21:16.766 --> 21:18.975
Not in my car it's not.

21:19.060 --> 21:20.937
Look, you won't get wet.

21:21.021 --> 21:23.146
I promise you.

21:25.858 --> 21:27.651
You know, most guys
wouldn't brag about that.

21:27.735 --> 21:31.238
Ha-ha-ha.
You know what I mean.

21:31.322 --> 21:35.950
Look, I know you guys are going
to Lake LBJ, and we can't come.

21:36.034 --> 21:37.577
I wanna make out!

21:37.662 --> 21:40.872
Okay, just stop with the whining.
It's not attractive.

21:46.504 --> 21:48.130
Okay, but I don't want it
super-fucking obvious

21:48.214 --> 21:50.090
to everybody
in the bar I've been gone,

21:50.174 --> 21:52.969
so we'll go in your car, we'll make out
for six minutes and that's it.

21:53.053 --> 21:54.053
- Deal?
- Great.

21:54.138 --> 21:55.554
No, no, no. Deal or no deal?

21:55.638 --> 21:57.973
If you're gonna whine
when I pull the plug in six minutes,

21:58.057 --> 22:00.100
we can just walk back inside
the fucking bar right now.

22:00.184 --> 22:01.727
- Deal. No whining.
- And no begging.

22:01.812 --> 22:04.230
And no begging.
When you say done, it's done.

22:04.314 --> 22:06.440
I'm gonna remember
you said that.

22:06.524 --> 22:08.066
Okay, let's go.

22:09.903 --> 22:11.279
Oh, you got two jobs:

22:11.363 --> 22:14.157
kiss good and make sure
my hair don't get wet.

you're trying to get her out of here

22:49.318 --> 22:50.693
before Christian Simonson shows up,

22:50.777 --> 22:53.488
but you've got to get her out of here
before Christian Simonson shows up.

22:53.572 --> 22:54.572
But what's the point?

22:54.656 --> 22:56.700
They're going to Shanna's
daddy's house at Lake LBJ,

22:56.783 --> 22:59.327
and it's no guys --
absolutely no guys.

22:59.411 --> 23:02.205
Okay, so after we bring
the girls drinks,

23:02.289 --> 23:06.793
in fairly rapid order, but not obvious,
we order two more rounds of shots.

23:06.878 --> 23:09.337
You think they're
gonna fall for that?

23:09.421 --> 23:12.216
We'll be very convincing.

23:12.300 --> 23:14.593
Now it's time to turn up the volume.
No more fucking around.

23:14.677 --> 23:17.054
We go to Jäger shots.

23:17.138 --> 23:19.514
Man, they're not gonna
drink Jäger shots.

23:19.598 --> 23:23.143
Dude, as long as a guy's buying the booze,
a fucking bitch'll drink anything.

23:23.228 --> 23:24.895
Come on, dude, we can at least
get one shot of Jäger

23:24.979 --> 23:26.522
down these fucking bitches' throats.

23:26.606 --> 23:28.565
After that, we'll see if they got
another Jäger shot in them.

23:28.650 --> 23:29.650
You never know.

23:29.734 --> 23:32.277
That could be the shot that puts
them past the point of "fuck it."

23:32.362 --> 23:34.154
Then all of a sudden,
"no guys at the lake house"

23:34.239 --> 23:35.864
turns into "a couple of guys
at the lake house."

23:35.949 --> 23:37.366
My point exactly.

23:37.450 --> 23:39.742
I know I can at least get
Shanna "Suck My" Banana

23:39.826 --> 23:41.118
to do a fucking Buttery Nipple shot.

23:41.203 --> 23:43.371
What's Julia's sweet shot?

23:43.455 --> 23:44.998
- Key lime pie.
- Oh, come on.

23:45.083 --> 23:47.918
Even fucking Leroy Brown'd
do one more for dessert.

23:51.046 --> 23:52.923
Dude, check it out.

and Nate was gentlemanly enough

24:46.144 --> 24:47.812
to escort me with his umbrella.

24:47.896 --> 24:50.273
Ah, good for you, Nate.

24:50.357 --> 24:52.357
You see that pretty girl
sitting by herself at the bar?

24:55.070 --> 24:56.696
Who, the dirty hippie?

24:56.780 --> 24:58.615
Meow. She's not a hippie.

24:58.699 --> 25:01.451
She might as well be a hippie.

25:01.535 --> 25:04.037
Thank you, Timmy boy.

25:04.121 --> 25:06.789
well, do you know
what just happened to her?

25:06.874 --> 25:10.543
No. But I know she's a skinny,
fake-blonde bitch.

25:12.087 --> 25:14.130
Oh, I'm sorry.
You were telling a story.

25:14.214 --> 25:15.798
What about her?

25:18.552 --> 25:22.847
Hey, Warren, is there anybody in this place
you could vouch for to give me a ride home?

25:25.017 --> 25:27.978
Fair lady, your chariot awaits.

25:28.063 --> 25:29.647
You've been eavesdropping?

25:29.731 --> 25:32.733
Oh, eavesdropping
and can't help but hear.

25:32.817 --> 25:35.819
I think I belong
in the latter category.

25:35.904 --> 25:37.738
So, uh, Icy Hot,

25:37.822 --> 25:40.157
are you offering me a ride home?

25:40.241 --> 25:43.743
I'm offering you a lift if,
when I'm ready to leave, you are, too.

25:43.827 --> 25:46.329
And when are you thinking
about leaving?

25:46.413 --> 25:48.665
Truthfully, I'm not thinking about it.

25:48.749 --> 25:52.670
But when I do,
you will be the first to know.

25:52.754 --> 25:54.504
Will you be able to, uh, drive later?

25:54.588 --> 25:57.757
I know looks can be deceiving,

25:57.841 --> 25:59.510
but I'm a teetotaler.

25:59.594 --> 26:01.970
I've been drinking club soda
and lime all night,

26:02.055 --> 26:03.847
and now I'm building up
to my big drink.

26:03.932 --> 26:05.473
Which is what?

26:05.557 --> 26:08.185
Virgin piña colada.

26:08.269 --> 26:12.022
Okay. Why would someone
who doesn't drink

26:12.107 --> 26:15.317
spend hours at a bar
drinking water?

26:15.402 --> 26:18.529
A bar offers all kind of things
other than alcohol.

26:18.613 --> 26:21.365
Mmm. Really?

26:21.449 --> 26:23.159
Like what?

26:24.620 --> 26:28.288
Women, nacho grande platters,

26:28.373 --> 26:31.000
the fellowship of some
fascinating individuals,

26:31.085 --> 26:32.210
like Warren here.

26:33.838 --> 26:36.922
Alcohol is just a lubricant
for all the individual encounters

26:37.006 --> 26:38.717
that a barroom offers.

26:38.801 --> 26:41.052
Ooh. Is that cowboy wisdom?

26:41.137 --> 26:44.347
I'm not a cowboy, Pam.

26:44.432 --> 26:46.181
I'm a stuntman.

26:46.266 --> 26:50.144

26:55.526 --> 26:58.485
couldn't help but overhear.

26:58.570 --> 27:01.321
Fair enough.

27:02.742 --> 27:04.993

27:05.077 --> 27:06.660

27:10.833 --> 27:13.752

27:13.836 --> 27:15.503

27:15.588 --> 27:18.798

27:52.708 --> 27:56.628
since I have a tab here,
can I buy you that virgin piña colada?

27:56.712 --> 27:58.963
Thank you, Pam.
That would be lovely.

27:59.048 --> 28:03.635
warren, a, uh, virgin piña colada
for my stuntman friend,

28:03.719 --> 28:06.388
and I'll have another
Cadillac Cabo Wabo margarita.

28:06.473 --> 28:09.140

29:33.311 --> 29:36.271
Take a picture.
It lasts longer.

29:36.355 --> 29:37.981
What?

29:38.065 --> 29:40.985
That table. Seems to keep,
um, getting your attention.

29:41.069 --> 29:43.945
Is that the girl
from the billboard outside?

29:44.030 --> 29:47.908
- Yep.
- She sure is a striking-looking woman.

29:47.992 --> 29:49.911
It's got gin, tequila --

29:49.995 --> 29:52.413
- Look at that hair.
- Lots of leave-in conditioner.

29:54.081 --> 29:57.500
- Is that jealousy I detect?
- Hardly.

29:57.585 --> 30:01.546
But if you wanna get with, uh, Jungle
Julia, there's a real easy way to do that.

30:01.631 --> 30:02.756
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:02.840 --> 30:04.966
- What would that be?
- Get famous.

30:05.051 --> 30:07.218
You won't have to find her.
She'll find you.

30:07.303 --> 30:10.597
And you don't even wanna know
what she did for that billboard.

30:10.681 --> 30:13.601
Enjoy it, cocksucker.
You've earned it.

30:13.685 --> 30:15.602
What did she ever do to you?

30:15.686 --> 30:18.146
We went to school together
from kindergarten through high school.

30:18.230 --> 30:20.399
That's what she did to me.

30:20.484 --> 30:23.235
She was her height right now at 12.

30:23.320 --> 30:24.945
She was a monster.

30:25.029 --> 30:26.947
Half the guys she still fucks
from the old class,

30:27.031 --> 30:28.991
she used to beat up and terrorize
in the fifth grade.

30:29.076 --> 30:31.702
I see. And she used to beat you up
and take your chocolate milk, huh?

30:31.787 --> 30:33.412
That pituitary case?

30:33.497 --> 30:34.955
Might've kicked my ass
a couple of times.

30:35.039 --> 30:38.000
Sorry. I'm built like a girl,
not a black man.

30:38.085 --> 30:41.712
But I'd die before I ever gave
Julia Lucai my chocolate milk.

31:13.370 --> 31:17.081
Hey, are you famous or something?

31:17.165 --> 31:18.624
Or something.

31:18.709 --> 31:21.127
No, no, no. Really.

31:21.211 --> 31:23.796
Hey, what do you do?

31:23.881 --> 31:25.424
Really?

31:25.508 --> 31:29.093
What I do is work my ass off
to get my own record label off the ground.

31:29.177 --> 31:32.055
But why that girl
wanted a picture of me

31:32.140 --> 31:34.141
is because I'm a local deejay.

31:36.436 --> 31:38.728
Wait a minute.

31:38.812 --> 31:42.399
You got a billboard
by Big Kahuna Burger, don't you?

31:42.483 --> 31:46.403
Yeah. I got one there,
too, Zatoichi.

31:49.574 --> 31:51.533
Yeah.

31:51.617 --> 31:53.869
Jungle Julia Lucai.

31:53.953 --> 31:55.872
Stuntman Mike McKay.

31:55.956 --> 32:00.500
Well, good to meet you,
Stuntman Mike.

32:00.585 --> 32:02.836
Now, my friends and I are gonna
continue to get our weed on.

32:02.920 --> 32:05.630
- Would you care for some?
- Thank you, Julia.

32:05.715 --> 32:08.841
But just the same, no, thanks.

32:08.925 --> 32:10.926
- Suit yourself.
- But, you know --

32:20.605 --> 32:24.149
Aw, shit. Oh, God.

32:25.985 --> 32:27.403
Sorry. It's nothing.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.407
What the fuck was that?

32:32.492 --> 32:34.868
Actually, I do want you
to have a shot.

32:36.997 --> 32:38.915
You got some voucher here.

32:38.999 --> 32:40.582
I asked him what movies
you worked on.

32:40.666 --> 32:42.459
No fucking clue.

32:42.543 --> 32:45.880
well, technically, I really don't know
if he's ever done anything for sure.

32:45.964 --> 32:48.549
I mean, he shows me
an episode of High Chaparall,

32:48.634 --> 32:51.302
a guy falls off a horse,
he says it's him.

32:53.222 --> 32:55.306
You know the show The Virginian?

32:56.934 --> 32:59.895
Yeah, well, there was another actor
on that show -- Gary Clarke --

32:59.979 --> 33:01.813
and I looked like him a bit.

33:01.897 --> 33:04.941
Obviously,
before I cut myself shaving.

33:05.025 --> 33:06.776
Oh, I like it.

33:06.860 --> 33:11.279
Well, damn if you ain't so sweet,
you make sugar taste just like salt.

33:11.364 --> 33:15.118
Anyway, I did a lot of Virginians
doubling Gary Clarke.

33:15.202 --> 33:18.663
And, uh, then that show
turned into The Men of Shiloh,

33:18.747 --> 33:21.414
they brought on Lee Majors,
and I doubled him.

33:21.499 --> 33:24.669
From that point on,
I specialized mostly in car stunts.

33:24.753 --> 33:28.589
Yeah, I did damn near
the whole third season of Vegas.

33:28.674 --> 33:30.843
I was Robert Urich's driving double.

33:30.927 --> 33:33.886
And then Bob did another show -- Gavilan,

33:33.971 --> 33:36.556
and he brought me
with him on that till ...

33:38.142 --> 33:40.727
And after that ...

33:43.814 --> 33:46.691
Do you know any of these shows
or people I'm talking about?

33:46.776 --> 33:48.402
Sorry.

33:48.486 --> 33:50.946
- No.
- No.

33:53.574 --> 33:57.828
So, how exactly does one
become a stuntman,

33:57.912 --> 33:59.913
Stuntman Mike?

33:59.998 --> 34:02.249
Well, in Hollywood,

34:02.333 --> 34:05.169
anybody fool enough
to throw himself down a flight of stairs

34:05.253 --> 34:07.171
can usually find somebody
to pay him for it.

34:07.255 --> 34:10.007
But, really, I got into the business

34:10.091 --> 34:11.717
the way most people
get in the stunt business.

34:11.801 --> 34:14.552
- How's that?
- My brother got me in it.

34:14.636 --> 34:16.971
- Well, who's your brother?
- Stuntman Bob.

34:23.812 --> 34:26.648
I'm trying to get these two shows
happening in New York for November.

34:30.612 --> 34:33.197
- I'm ready to blaze.
- Finally. Yeah.

34:33.281 --> 34:35.949
- You need to catch up with us.
- Now the party can start.

34:36.034 --> 34:37.034
Yep.

34:37.118 --> 34:39.369
Anyhoo, I'm sorry.

34:39.454 --> 34:41.996
Will you forgive me?

34:42.081 --> 34:46.210
But you have to be real nice to me
for the whole rest of the time I'm here.

34:46.293 --> 34:49.254
- Promise. You ready to go to the lake?
- Mm-hmm.

34:49.339 --> 34:51.007
How about your little friend?
You wanna bring him?

34:51.091 --> 34:52.759
I thought no boys.

34:52.842 --> 34:54.802
If you really want him to come,
Shanna won't mind.

34:54.887 --> 34:57.471
So, how about it?
Boys or just us girls?

34:57.555 --> 34:59.224
Us girls.

34:59.308 --> 35:02.060
Good idea.

35:02.144 --> 35:03.811
Ladies.

35:05.563 --> 35:07.690
Thanks.

35:07.775 --> 35:09.734
Cheers, Butterfly.

35:12.154 --> 35:16.281
"The woods are lovely, dark and deep,

35:16.366 --> 35:21.745
"and I have promises to keep
and miles to go before I sleep.

35:21.829 --> 35:24.958
"Did you hear me, Butterfly?

35:25.042 --> 35:29.253
Miles to go before you sleep."

35:30.506 --> 35:32.131
Sorry, Stuntman Burt --

35:32.258 --> 35:33.466
Mike.

35:33.550 --> 35:36.927
Mike. She already
broke off that dance.

35:37.011 --> 35:39.973
Is that true?

35:40.057 --> 35:42.767
Did I miss my chance?

35:45.521 --> 35:47.522
Do I frighten you?

35:52.152 --> 35:53.821
Is it my scar?

35:55.907 --> 35:57.782
It's your car.

35:57.866 --> 36:00.076
Ah. Yeah, I know.

36:00.160 --> 36:01.912
Sorry.

36:01.997 --> 36:03.998
It's my mom's car.

36:06.793 --> 36:08.710
Have you been following us?

36:08.794 --> 36:10.963
No. But that's what
I love about Austin.

36:11.047 --> 36:13.132
It's just so damn small.

36:13.216 --> 36:16.510
- You've seen this guy before?
- I saw him outside of Guero's.

36:16.594 --> 36:19.470
And I saw you outside Guero's, too.

36:19.555 --> 36:22.307
You saw my car, I saw your legs.

36:22.391 --> 36:25.728
Now, look, I ain't stalking y'all,
but I didn't say I wasn't a wolf.

36:25.812 --> 36:27.813
So you really weren't following us?

36:27.897 --> 36:29.147
I'm not following you, Butterfly.

36:29.231 --> 36:32.400
I just got lucky.

36:33.945 --> 36:38.240
So, how about that lap dance?

36:38.325 --> 36:40.158
Sorry. It was a one-time-only offer,

36:40.242 --> 36:43.620
and she did it earlier
this evening at Anton's.

36:43.705 --> 36:45.998
- No, she didn't.
- How do you know?

36:46.082 --> 36:48.834
I'm good that way.

36:48.918 --> 36:50.711
And you look a little touchéd.

36:50.795 --> 36:53.172
- What's "touchéd"?
- Wounded slightly.

36:53.256 --> 36:55.049
Why should I be wounded?

36:55.133 --> 36:57.552
Because you expected guys
to be pestering you all night,

36:57.636 --> 37:01.513
but from your look,
I can tell nobody pestered you at all.

37:01.598 --> 37:04.058
That kind of hurt your feelings
a little bit, didn't it?

37:05.811 --> 37:09.022
There are few things
as fetching as a bruised ego

37:09.106 --> 37:11.065
on a beautiful angel.

37:14.362 --> 37:17.405
So ...

37:17.490 --> 37:22.201
how about that lap dance?

37:22.285 --> 37:24.787
I think I'm gonna have to
give you a rain check.

37:27.707 --> 37:29.918
well, since you'll be leaving
in the next couple of days,

37:30.002 --> 37:33.796
that rain check will be worthless.

37:33.880 --> 37:36.883
But that's okay.

37:36.967 --> 37:39.552
I understand
if I make you uncomfortable.

37:39.637 --> 37:42.388
You're still a nice girl,

37:42.472 --> 37:45.266
and I still like you.

37:45.393 --> 37:48.812
But I must warn you of something.

37:48.896 --> 37:50.897
You know how people say ...

37:50.981 --> 37:53.108
"You're okay in my book,"

37:53.192 --> 37:56.486
or, "In my book, that's no good"?

37:56.570 --> 38:01.826
Well, I actually have a book.

38:01.910 --> 38:03.785
And everybody I ever meet

38:03.869 --> 38:06.162
goes in this book.

38:06.247 --> 38:10.209
And now I've met you,
and you're going in the book.

38:11.878 --> 38:17.425
Except I'm afraid I must file you ...

38:18.427 --> 38:21.595
under "chickenshit."

38:21.680 --> 38:23.680
And what if I did it?

38:23.764 --> 38:28.435
Well, I definitely couldn't file you
under "chickenshit" then, now, could I?

38:28.519 --> 38:31.020
What's your name again?

38:31.105 --> 38:32.105
Stuntman Mike.

38:32.189 --> 38:35.942
Well, Stuntman Mike, I'm Butterfly.

38:36.026 --> 38:40.823
My friend Jungle Julia over here says
that jukebox inside is pretty impressive.

38:40.907 --> 38:43.284
- Yeah, it is.
- Yeah.

38:43.368 --> 38:47.328
why don't you go get ready
for your lap dance?

39:00.594 --> 39:04.431
what about "kind of cute, kind of hot,
kind of sexy, hysterically funny,

39:04.515 --> 39:07.016
but not funny-looking guy
who you could fuck"

we're gonna go somewhere else.
We're gonna go hang out.

42:04.488 --> 42:06.489
- You ready to go?
- Yeah.

42:06.573 --> 42:08.992
- Bye.
- Bye.

42:11.829 --> 42:13.663
I think you got Mike laid tonight.

42:15.416 --> 42:18.418
Lookin' good, Cannonball Run!

42:18.503 --> 42:20.712
He's just giving me a ride.

42:20.797 --> 42:24.216
- Oh, no doubt.
- Have a nice ride!

42:25.885 --> 42:28.011
Look, double fucks ...

42:30.891 --> 42:33.767
uh-uh, I am not gonna fuck him.

42:33.851 --> 42:36.687
I can hear you.

42:36.771 --> 42:40.691
- He's old enough to be my dad --
- I can still hear you.

42:43.111 --> 42:46.697
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

42:52.203 --> 42:54.120
Wow, that's fucking scary.

42:54.204 --> 42:55.872
Yeah, well,
I wanted it to be impressive.

42:55.957 --> 42:59.835
Scary tends to impress.

42:59.919 --> 43:01.712
Is it safe?

43:01.796 --> 43:04.715
Oh, it's better than safe.
It's death proof.

43:04.799 --> 43:07.384
How do you make a car death proof?

43:07.468 --> 43:09.261
well, that's what stuntmen do.

43:09.345 --> 43:11.848
You've seen a movie
where a car gets into some smash-up

43:11.932 --> 43:14.850
there ain't no way in hell
anybody's walking away from?

43:14.934 --> 43:16.017
Yeah.

43:16.102 --> 43:17.853
Well, how do you think
they accomplish that?

43:17.937 --> 43:20.565
CGI?

43:20.649 --> 43:24.902
well, unfortunately, Pam, nowadays,
more often than not, you're right.

43:24.987 --> 43:27.905
But back in the all-or-nothing days,
the Vanishing Point days,

43:27.990 --> 43:30.158
the Dirty Mary Crazy Larry days,

43:30.242 --> 43:32.076
the White Line Fever days --

43:32.161 --> 43:34.872
real cars
smashing into real cars

43:34.956 --> 43:37.749
with real dumb people
driving them.

43:37.833 --> 43:40.960
So, you give the stunt team
the car you want to smash up,

43:41.044 --> 43:43.254
take her and reinforce
that fucker everywhere,

43:43.338 --> 43:48.675
and voilà, you got yourself
a death-proof automobile.

43:49.761 --> 43:50.762
That makes sense.

43:50.846 --> 43:53.139
I just didn't know you could
make a car death proof.

43:53.223 --> 43:55.141
Hell, I can drive this baby
into a brick wall

43:55.225 --> 43:59.353
doing 125 miles an hour
just for the experience.

44:06.321 --> 44:08.321
Why is your passenger seat in a box?

44:08.405 --> 44:10.114
well, this is a movie car.

44:10.199 --> 44:13.242
Sometimes when you're shooting a crash,
director wants to put a camera in the car.

44:13.327 --> 44:15.871
You know, shoot the crash
from the inside.

44:15.955 --> 44:18.790
That's where you put the camera.
They call it a crash box. Here.

44:20.584 --> 44:22.127
There you go.

44:23.671 --> 44:25.798
You know, when you asked
to drive me home,

44:25.882 --> 44:27.799
you didn't mention your car
didn't have a passenger seat.

44:27.883 --> 44:30.803
Yeah, well, actually,
I didn't ask to drive you home.

44:30.887 --> 44:34.181
You asked me for a ride, and I said yes.
But look at the bright side, Pam.

44:34.265 --> 44:37.309
I won't be getting fresh
putting my hand on your knee.

44:39.187 --> 44:41.939
That is the bright side.

44:42.023 --> 44:44.650
I thought so.

45:09.258 --> 45:11.593
Well, Pam, which way you going?

45:11.678 --> 45:13.512
- Left or right?
- Right.

45:13.596 --> 45:16.098
Ah, that's too bad.

45:16.182 --> 45:17.433
Why?

45:17.518 --> 45:21.186
Well, because there was a 50-50 shot
on whether you'd be going left or right.

45:21.271 --> 45:23.355
You see, we're both going left.

45:23.439 --> 45:25.650
You could've just as easily
been going left, too,

45:25.734 --> 45:26.860
and if that was the case,

45:26.944 --> 45:29.404
it would've been a while
before you started getting scared.

45:29.488 --> 45:31.947
But since you're going the other way,

45:32.031 --> 45:33.908
I'm afraid ...

45:33.993 --> 45:38.204
you're gonna have to start
getting scared ... immediately.

45:38.289 --> 45:40.415
What the fuck?

45:48.883 --> 45:50.883
Cocksucking motherfucker!

45:50.967 --> 45:52.718
Just fucking let me out of here!

45:52.802 --> 45:54.052
I'll fucking rip your fucking --

45:54.137 --> 45:55.470
Stop the fucking car!

46:37.849 --> 46:40.809
Okay, here's the thing.

46:40.936 --> 46:43.102
I get it.

46:43.187 --> 46:46.607
I -- I know it's a joke,
and it's super-funny.

46:46.691 --> 46:50.736
Um, but if you just stop right now,

46:50.820 --> 46:53.113
you know, and -- and -- and let me out,

46:53.198 --> 46:56.324
I'll never tell anybody,
because I know it's a joke.

46:56.408 --> 46:58.326
I know all about jokes.

46:59.870 --> 47:02.581
I promise everything will be fine.

47:02.666 --> 47:05.333
Just -- Just -- Just let me out,

47:05.417 --> 47:07.543
please, and -- and --

47:07.628 --> 47:09.463
Hey, Pam,

47:09.547 --> 47:12.800
remember when I said
this car was death proof?

47:13.802 --> 47:16.135
well, that wasn't a lie.

47:16.220 --> 47:19.306
This car is 100% death proof.

47:19.391 --> 47:22.601
Only, to get the benefit of it, honey,

47:22.686 --> 47:26.063
you really need to be
sitting in my seat.

48:03.351 --> 48:07.312
Now I gotta catch me
my other girlfriends.

48:21.328 --> 48:22.328
No, no, no, no.

48:22.413 --> 48:26.374
It's Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mitch and Tich.

48:26.459 --> 48:29.377
So you got it?
Thanks, honey.

48:29.462 --> 48:32.047
You're gonna play it next song, right?

48:32.131 --> 48:34.549
Good boy.

48:34.633 --> 48:37.261
Growl.

48:37.345 --> 48:39.387
Bye-bye.

48:39.472 --> 48:41.056
Who do you wanna hear?

48:41.140 --> 48:42.807
Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mitch and Tich.

48:42.892 --> 48:44.143
Who?

48:44.227 --> 48:47.271
Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mitch and Tich.

48:47.355 --> 48:49.064
Who the fuck are they?

48:49.148 --> 48:53.110
For your information, Pete Townshend,
at one point, almost quit The Who,

48:53.195 --> 48:55.613
and if he had,
he would've ended up in this group,

48:55.697 --> 48:59.574
thus making it Dave Dee, Dozy,
Beaky, Mitch, Tich and Pete.

48:59.658 --> 49:01.993
And if you ask me, he should have.

51:46.787 --> 51:49.747
Uh, I don't remember.

51:52.626 --> 51:54.628
Dr. Block.

52:00.759 --> 52:03.595
Self restraints to room 310.

52:03.680 --> 52:06.264
Self restraints to room 310.

52:07.349 --> 52:12.561
well, what's the patient's
prognosis, Dr. Block?

52:12.646 --> 52:14.939
I don't really see
it's any of your business.

52:15.023 --> 52:17.023
Come on now, sis.

52:17.108 --> 52:19.110
You just tell us.

52:19.194 --> 52:21.195
How bad is he?

52:25.117 --> 52:27.118
He got banged up real good.

52:27.202 --> 52:29.328
Busted nose, broken collarbone,

52:29.413 --> 52:31.455
smashed up his left index finger.

52:31.540 --> 52:33.374
Is that it?

52:34.627 --> 52:36.253
He was real lucky.

52:38.422 --> 52:40.131
That'll be all?

52:40.215 --> 52:44.177
Why, that's more than enough,
and I wanna thank you, Dr. Block.

52:47.389 --> 52:49.181
Son of a bitch!

52:50.393 --> 52:53.645
So, Pop, what do you think?

52:53.730 --> 52:56.023
well, son number one,

52:56.107 --> 52:58.150
what I think is so goddamn ghoulish,

52:58.234 --> 53:00.569
I hesitate to speak it out loud.

53:00.653 --> 53:02.988
Well, give it a shot.

53:03.072 --> 53:06.326
Well, what we have here
is a case of vehicular homicide.

53:06.410 --> 53:09.161
That old boy in there
murdered them pretty little gals.

53:09.245 --> 53:13.040
I mean, he used a car and not a hatchet,
but they dead just the same.

53:14.542 --> 53:17.419
Well, what are you gonna do?

53:17.503 --> 53:19.503
Not a goddamn thing.

53:19.588 --> 53:22.257
The DA says ain't no crime here.

53:22.342 --> 53:25.135
Every one of them gals
was swimming in alcohol

53:25.219 --> 53:27.346
and floating on weed.

53:27.430 --> 53:29.723
And old Hooper in there

53:29.807 --> 53:31.725
came out clean as a whistle.

53:31.809 --> 53:35.729
Now, you actually think that he
premeditatedly murdered them gals?

53:35.813 --> 53:37.648
Well, I can't prove it,

53:37.733 --> 53:41.151
but since thinking don't cost nothing,
I can think it, and I do.

53:41.235 --> 53:44.529
Yeah, but, Pop, he got
pretty banged up hisself.

53:44.614 --> 53:46.866
Well, hell, yeah, he got banged up,
but God damn!

53:46.950 --> 53:49.868
Them pretty little gals
look like a goddamn giant

53:49.952 --> 53:51.495
chewed 'em up and spit 'em out.

53:51.579 --> 53:53.038
Any of 'em survive?

53:53.123 --> 53:54.749
Shit.

53:54.833 --> 53:57.377
Two tons of metal,
200 miles an hour,

53:57.461 --> 54:00.212
flesh and bone
and plain old Newton ...

54:00.296 --> 54:02.757
They all princess died.

54:08.973 --> 54:10.598
Why?

54:10.682 --> 54:15.478
well, I'd guestimate
it's a sex thing.

54:15.562 --> 54:17.230
The only way I can figure it.

54:17.314 --> 54:19.399
High-velocity impact,

54:19.483 --> 54:22.401
twisted metal, busted glass,

54:22.485 --> 54:26.239
all four souls taken
exactly at the same time.

54:26.323 --> 54:31.618
Probably the only way that
diabolical degenerate can shoot his goo.

54:31.702 --> 54:34.414
Yeah, I think the only thing
we can dream of getting that bastard on

54:34.498 --> 54:37.917
is vehicular manslaughter
for the hitchhiker in the death box.

54:38.001 --> 54:40.921
That was just plain old goddamn
reckless endangerment.

54:41.005 --> 54:44.632
But I got me a goddamn bartender
gonna testify

54:44.716 --> 54:48.136
that old Stuntman Mike
didn't drink a drop all night,

54:48.220 --> 54:51.265
and his passenger
was left stranded by her date

54:51.349 --> 54:55.268
in the goddamn rain, no less,
and she asked him for the fucking ride.

54:55.352 --> 54:59.148
Now, on paper, it's gonna look like
he's just trying to help her out.

54:59.232 --> 55:01.567
I mean, that's the way
the jury's gonna see it.

55:01.651 --> 55:03.651
So what are you gonna do, Pop?

55:04.863 --> 55:08.198
well, I can take it upon myself
to work the case, you know,

55:08.283 --> 55:09.741
in my off hours.

55:09.826 --> 55:12.995
Search for evidence,
you know, to prove my theory.

55:13.079 --> 55:16.623
Alert authorities.
Dog that rotten son of a bitch.

55:16.708 --> 55:18.000
Wherever he goes, I go.

55:18.084 --> 55:20.794
Or I can spend

55:20.879 --> 55:23.463
the same goddamn amount
of time and energy

55:23.547 --> 55:26.299
following the NASCAR circuit.

55:26.383 --> 55:28.552
Hmm. I thought about it a lot.

55:28.636 --> 55:32.264
I think I'd have a hell of lot
happier life if I did the latter.

55:32.348 --> 55:37.561
And just because I can't punish old ...
Frankenstein in there for what he's done,

55:37.645 --> 55:40.606
I'm gonna tell you
like the Lord told John.

55:40.690 --> 55:42.566
If he ever does it again,

55:42.650 --> 55:45.986
I can make goddamn sure
he don't do it in Texas.

- No, he's on the 4th and I'm on the 7th.

57:15.036 --> 57:17.371
- Who's in whose room?
- He's in mine.

57:17.455 --> 57:19.790
- And, so, what happened then?
- That was pretty much it.

57:19.874 --> 57:21.468
We made out in the hall
for about 10 minutes,

57:21.481 --> 57:23.085
and then I sent him
off to his room.

57:23.169 --> 57:27.006
- So, how's The Rock as a kisser?
- Mmm, he's damn good!

57:27.090 --> 57:29.591
He's got them mushy lips
and fingertips.

57:29.675 --> 57:31.426
Mmm, I love them mushy lips.

57:31.510 --> 57:32.594
And he's a big guy,

57:32.678 --> 57:34.679
so he spins me around
so my back's up against him.

57:34.763 --> 57:37.433
Then he takes his big hand,
and he puts it on my throat,

57:37.517 --> 57:39.851
tilts my head back
and leans over me,

57:39.935 --> 57:42.061
kisses me from behind.

57:42.146 --> 57:45.399
- Damn, that sounds sexy!
- Mmm, it was sexy.

57:45.483 --> 57:47.318
But then that was it?
You sent him off?

57:47.402 --> 57:49.069
How'd he take it?

57:49.153 --> 57:50.778
Wait a minute.
What are we doing here?

57:50.863 --> 57:52.865
If I'm gonna power through
and pick up Zoë at the airport,

57:52.949 --> 57:54.617
I need a big-ass cup of coffee.

57:54.701 --> 57:55.701
Since you're getting that,

57:55.785 --> 57:58.454
can you get some more vodka
and some more sugar-free Red Bull?

58:00.624 --> 58:02.124
We didn't know you were awake.

58:02.208 --> 58:04.209
I'm not awake. I'm asleep.

58:04.294 --> 58:07.380
But get some more vodka
and some more sugar-free Red Bull anyway.

58:07.465 --> 58:09.299
And some Red Apple Tans.

58:09.383 --> 58:12.635
Damn! I didn't stop
to get you bitches groceries!

58:13.762 --> 58:16.431
- You remember how
to get to the airport, don't you?
- Uh-huh.

58:16.515 --> 58:17.974
well, then, you should
get behind the wheel,

58:18.059 --> 58:19.851
'cause you gonna drive.

58:21.269 --> 58:22.811
Motherfuckers!

58:39.789 --> 58:41.497
They ain't got sugar-free Red Bull.

58:41.581 --> 58:44.708
They got regular Red Bull
and sugar-free G.O. juice.

58:44.793 --> 58:47.295
- G.O.

No, it wasn't you.

01:00:38.074 --> 01:00:41.076

when he walked by.

01:00:42.370 --> 01:00:44.789

01:01:16.656 --> 01:01:18.782
Since I'm up,

01:01:18.866 --> 01:01:22.285
I might as well hit the ATM.

01:01:23.287 --> 01:01:25.498
Get me a fucking smoke.

01:02:49.458 --> 01:02:51.249
What?

01:02:51.334 --> 01:02:53.419
Did you just see the --

01:02:53.503 --> 01:02:55.046
What?

01:02:55.130 --> 01:02:58.257
Nothing, honey.

01:03:21.282 --> 01:03:22.323
Yello.

01:03:22.407 --> 01:03:23.783
It's me.

01:03:23.867 --> 01:03:25.410
Miss me?

01:03:25.495 --> 01:03:29.206
Oh, you best get your ass
off Kim's car.

01:03:29.290 --> 01:03:30.999
I've seen Kim sit on it before.

01:03:31.084 --> 01:03:33.043
Her ass ain't your ass.

01:03:33.127 --> 01:03:34.711
Okay.

01:03:34.796 --> 01:03:37.547
So, I think I'm in
this month's issue of Allure.

01:03:41.220 --> 01:03:42.637
You got Allure?

01:03:42.721 --> 01:03:44.638
Magazines by the window.

01:03:59.070 --> 01:04:01.488
Here you are!

01:04:02.991 --> 01:04:05.742
You hot mama, you.

01:04:05.827 --> 01:04:07.244
See you in a second.

01:04:08.371 --> 01:04:10.455
3.85. Out of 20.

01:04:14.627 --> 01:04:16.503
And you get 15 and change back.

01:04:16.587 --> 01:04:18.338
Thank you very much.

01:04:19.924 --> 01:04:23.136
You know, I got other fashion magazines
for sale behind the counter.

01:04:25.638 --> 01:04:28.141
No, that's okay.
This'll be all.

01:04:28.225 --> 01:04:30.018
- Thought I'd ask.
- Thanks anyway.

01:04:30.102 --> 01:04:31.728
Have a good one.

01:04:34.314 --> 01:04:37.608
I got this month's issue
of Italian Vogue.

01:04:42.281 --> 01:04:45.242
This month's?

01:04:45.326 --> 01:04:48.036
Listen to this.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:52.123
The Circle A clerk has
this month's issue of Italian Vogue.

01:04:52.207 --> 01:04:53.624
- No way.
- Way.

01:04:53.709 --> 01:04:56.209
I can't believe a fucking Circle A
carries Italian Vogue.

01:04:56.294 --> 01:04:58.962
It doesn't.
It's his own personal copy.

01:04:59.047 --> 01:05:01.049
He'll let it go for 27 bucks.

01:05:01.133 --> 01:05:02.967
Twenty-seven bucks?

01:05:03.052 --> 01:05:05.428
What the fuck do you care?
We're talking about fucking per diem here.

01:05:05.512 --> 01:05:08.431
Look, we found an issue of Italian Vogue
in Lebanon, Tennessee.

01:05:08.515 --> 01:05:10.516
we're lucky he's not asking
for fucking Krugerrands.

01:05:10.601 --> 01:05:12.643
I'm getting it,
and we're splitting it three ways.

01:05:12.728 --> 01:05:13.895
What, me, you and Kim?

01:05:13.979 --> 01:05:15.563
No, Kim doesn't give a shit
about Italian Vogue.

01:05:15.648 --> 01:05:19.609
But Brandy will come in with us,
and if she won't, Tysla, her sister, will.

01:05:20.694 --> 01:05:23.572
Okay. But if anybody
tears out any sheets I want,

01:05:23.656 --> 01:05:25.115
you gotta make color Xerox
of those pages.

01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:27.076
And I'm not talking fucking Kinko's
here either, okay?

01:05:27.160 --> 01:05:30.953

you have them do it fucking right.

Your timing couldn't be better, Zoë.

01:06:35.062 --> 01:06:39.691
It just so happens that we're all three off
duty for the next three days of shooting.

01:06:39.775 --> 01:06:42.234
Fucking hell.
How does that happen?

01:06:42.318 --> 01:06:45.155
well, I'm doing Lindsay Lohan's makeup,
and she's off for the next three days,

01:06:45.239 --> 01:06:48.324
there's no stunts being filmed
during that time, so Kim's free,

01:06:48.409 --> 01:06:52.412
and Lee's on a "will notify"
for the next four days.

01:06:52.496 --> 01:06:54.330
So, how's the shoot going?

01:06:54.415 --> 01:06:56.207
Great. We're having the best time.

01:06:56.292 --> 01:06:58.459
The director, Cecil Evans,
is so much fun.

01:06:58.544 --> 01:07:02.171
we're making the coolest movie
and partying all the time.

01:07:02.255 --> 01:07:05.340
Hell, yeah. The next job after this one
is definitely gonna suck.

01:07:05.425 --> 01:07:07.385
So, let's hear it, ladies.

01:07:07.469 --> 01:07:09.971
Set romances.
Who's getting it off?

01:07:10.055 --> 01:07:12.264
That would be Lee and Toolbox.

01:07:12.348 --> 01:07:15.560
Oh, Toolbox.
Name sounds promising.

01:07:15.644 --> 01:07:17.770
- He's a grip.
- What he is is a pervert.

01:07:17.855 --> 01:07:21.399
Well, he just keeps sounding
better and better.

01:07:21.483 --> 01:07:23.568
What's his perversion?

01:07:24.612 --> 01:07:27.447
He likes to watch me pee.

01:07:27.531 --> 01:07:32.036
Lee is sitting on the toilet,
and Toolbox is watching her pee.

01:07:32.119 --> 01:07:34.204
P-I-S-S-I-N-G.

01:07:36.040 --> 01:07:37.332
Yeah, but not no more.

01:07:37.416 --> 01:07:40.211
Now she's getting it on with The Rock.

01:07:40.295 --> 01:07:42.629
- You're having one off with The Rock?
- Not the real Rock.

01:07:42.713 --> 01:07:44.047
He's this electrician named Bruce.

01:07:44.131 --> 01:07:46.424
And Kim started calling him The Rock,
'cause he kind of looks like The Rock,

01:07:46.509 --> 01:07:48.219
so now we all just call him The Rock.

01:07:48.303 --> 01:07:49.887
Oh, yeah.
This is an all-star crew.

01:07:49.971 --> 01:07:51.639
We got a guy who looks like Nick Cage

01:07:51.723 --> 01:07:53.264
and a guy who looks
like Pee-wee Herman, too.

01:07:53.349 --> 01:07:56.060
Kim, dick department.
Let's hear it.

01:07:56.144 --> 01:07:57.770
Mm-mm. No dick this trip.

01:07:57.854 --> 01:07:59.813
I got a man.

01:07:59.898 --> 01:08:02.942
- How long have you had this boyfriend?
- About three months.

01:08:03.026 --> 01:08:04.567
Who'd you steal him from?

01:08:04.652 --> 01:08:06.778
- Nobody.
- Kim!

01:08:06.862 --> 01:08:08.238
Wha -- What?

01:08:08.322 --> 01:08:10.449
He totally had a girlfriend.

01:08:10.533 --> 01:08:13.785
All of Kim's boyfriends start out
as somebody else's boyfriend.

01:08:13.869 --> 01:08:15.828
I did not steal him.

01:08:15.913 --> 01:08:18.081
I didn't steal any of them.

01:08:18.165 --> 01:08:21.085
They just ... jumped ship.

01:08:23.337 --> 01:08:25.255
So, what's your story, Abernathy?

01:08:25.339 --> 01:08:27.258
Oh, Abbie's got the big kahuna.

01:08:27.341 --> 01:08:30.426
I had a set crush on Cecil.

01:08:30.511 --> 01:08:33.264
Set crush? Nigga, please!
You were his set wife.

01:08:33.348 --> 01:08:36.100
"Were" and "had"
being the key words here.

01:08:36.184 --> 01:08:38.310
Bitch, you two are still
into each other, and you know it.

01:08:38.395 --> 01:08:40.354
Yeah, well,
if he's so in love with me,

01:08:40.438 --> 01:08:44.149
then whey did he fuck
Daryl Hannah's stand-in?

01:08:44.277 --> 01:08:46.777
Ho-ho-ho!

01:08:46.861 --> 01:08:50.698
Yes, men are dogs.
Oh, it's so funny!

01:08:50.783 --> 01:08:52.867
Oh, it's so funny!

01:08:52.952 --> 01:08:54.828
Oh, stop acting all hurt.
Your ass just mad.

01:08:54.912 --> 01:08:57.287
Yeah, he's a stand-in fucker.

01:08:57.372 --> 01:08:59.791
Bitch, you need to get over that shit.
That was two weeks ago.

01:08:59.875 --> 01:09:03.461
Oh, well,
now that you put it like that.

01:09:03.546 --> 01:09:05.962
Oh, I haven't told you
the best part.

01:09:06.046 --> 01:09:09.258
He fucked her on my birthday.

01:09:09.341 --> 01:09:11.969
Oh, that's a horse of a different color.

01:09:12.053 --> 01:09:13.429
Thank you.

01:09:13.513 --> 01:09:15.140
Did he know it was your birthday?

01:09:15.224 --> 01:09:18.142
He's the director.
He's kind of busy.

01:09:18.225 --> 01:09:22.354
He ate a piece of my birthday cake
and he got me a present.

01:09:22.439 --> 01:09:24.482
Yeah, I think he knew.

01:09:24.567 --> 01:09:27.526
Well, what did he get you?

01:09:31.115 --> 01:09:32.698
He made me a tape.

01:09:32.783 --> 01:09:34.408
He made you a tape?

01:09:34.493 --> 01:09:35.910
- Yeah.
- Wait.

01:09:35.995 --> 01:09:37.996
He didn't burn you a CD.
He made you a tape?

01:09:38.080 --> 01:09:41.416
- Yeah.
- Oh, that is so romantic.

01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:44.377
Yes. I know what you're gonna say,
so don't even go there.

01:09:44.462 --> 01:09:46.505
That sounds like the test
of true love to me.

01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:48.923
Look, I know you guys like him.

01:09:49.008 --> 01:09:53.136
He's likable, but he fucked
another woman on my birthday.

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:54.847
How can you not be on my side?

01:09:54.931 --> 01:09:56.932
well, I admit, that sounds bad.

01:09:57.017 --> 01:09:58.350
It is bad!

01:09:58.434 --> 01:10:01.353
It just sounds like
there's a little more to it than that.

01:10:01.438 --> 01:10:03.898
- Were you two fucking?
- Hell, no.

01:10:03.982 --> 01:10:05.941
Hello. Is your name Abernathy?

01:10:06.026 --> 01:10:07.526
Sorry.

01:10:07.611 --> 01:10:11.404
The answer to your question
is no, of course not.

01:10:11.489 --> 01:10:14.407
What do you mean,
"No, of course not"?

01:10:14.492 --> 01:10:18.661
The reason Cecil hasn't had a girlfriend in
six years is because girls will fuck him.

01:10:18.746 --> 01:10:22.040
And if you fuck Cecil,
you don't become one of his girlfriends.

01:10:22.124 --> 01:10:25.795
Not to say I want
to be his girlfriend,

01:10:25.879 --> 01:10:28.381
but if I did want to be his girlfriend,

01:10:28.465 --> 01:10:31.007
if I fucked him,
I wouldn't be his girlfriend.

01:10:31.092 --> 01:10:33.469
I'd be one of his regulars.

01:10:34.638 --> 01:10:36.555
And I'm just getting
too fucking old for that shit.

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:39.058
Have you let him do anything?

01:10:39.142 --> 01:10:40.558
Yes!

01:10:41.561 --> 01:10:43.521
I've let him give me a foot massage,

01:10:43.605 --> 01:10:46.899
and when we go to the movies,
I've let him hold my hand.

01:10:46.983 --> 01:10:50.152
Bitch, you might be acting
like you 12 years old,

01:10:50.237 --> 01:10:51.862
but he just acting like a man.

01:10:51.947 --> 01:10:54.031
You need to break
that nigga off a piece.

01:10:54.116 --> 01:10:56.117
Let me get this straight.

01:10:56.201 --> 01:10:58.203
- You're not fucking him ...
- Mm-mm.

01:10:58.287 --> 01:10:59.704
- You're not sucking him ...
- Mm-mm.

01:10:59.789 --> 01:11:03.582
you're not giving him any tongue,
but Daryl Hannah's stand-in is.

01:11:03.667 --> 01:11:05.794
Okay, can we just take
my sex life off the table?

01:11:05.878 --> 01:11:10.424
Actually, uh, it was Cecil's sex life
that was on the table and your lack of one.

01:11:10.508 --> 01:11:12.591
Ohhh!

01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:19.140
Fuck both of you
and your little high five.

01:11:19.224 --> 01:11:23.894
Before you can claim a nigga,
you got to claim a nigga,

01:11:23.979 --> 01:11:26.480
and you can start by giving
that motherfucker a hand job

01:11:26.565 --> 01:11:27.940
in the back of the van on Tuesday.

01:11:28.024 --> 01:11:29.651
I'm not gonna do that.

01:11:29.735 --> 01:11:32.403
I know you won't.
But you know who will.

01:11:32.487 --> 01:11:35.448
The bitch that ends up living
in that big-ass mansion of his.

01:11:35.532 --> 01:11:39.995
Now, I gotta say, I haven't entirely agreed
with everything Kim said, but it is true:

01:11:40.079 --> 01:11:42.455
If you stretch shit out
like you have with Cecil,

01:11:42.539 --> 01:11:44.624
and you suddenly get dirty on them,

01:11:44.709 --> 01:11:48.295
it blows their mind.

01:11:48.379 --> 01:11:51.965
So, Zoë, Kim and I are in the Philippines
at an outdoor rave.

01:11:52.049 --> 01:11:55.302
- What were you working on?
- Three Kicks to the Head, Part Three.

01:11:55.386 --> 01:11:58.889
And, admittedly,
we're a little fucked-up.

01:11:58.973 --> 01:12:01.851
- Cheers to that.
- Word.

01:12:01.935 --> 01:12:03.351
Cheers.

01:12:03.478 --> 01:12:05.729
So, Zoë,

01:12:05.813 --> 01:12:07.647
the genius,

01:12:07.732 --> 01:12:10.485
wants to take a picture of me.

01:12:10.569 --> 01:12:14.112
It's dark as hell,
and you can't see shit.

01:12:14.197 --> 01:12:16.573
So she's got her camera
and keeps saying,

01:12:16.657 --> 01:12:19.034
"Step back a little," so I do.

01:12:19.118 --> 01:12:23.497
Then, "A little further,"
so I step back a little further.

01:12:23.580 --> 01:12:26.875
Then, "A little more," so I do.

01:12:26.959 --> 01:12:29.836
Then I realize I'm right at the edge

01:12:29.921 --> 01:12:32.507
of a seven-foot concrete ditch

01:12:32.591 --> 01:12:37.511
with God knows how many rocks
and broken bottles and rats in it,

01:12:37.595 --> 01:12:40.890
and if I fell in that fucking thing, I'd
probably would've broken my fucking neck.

01:12:40.974 --> 01:12:44.893
So I'm yelling at her,
"Zoë, you almost killed me!"

01:12:46.687 --> 01:12:50.608
So we laugh about it
and walk a little further,

01:12:50.692 --> 01:12:53.277
and Zoë starts fucking around,

01:12:53.445 --> 01:12:59.033
and damn if she doesn't fall
in the fucking ditch.

01:12:59.117 --> 01:13:01.369
Nice. Nice.

01:13:01.453 --> 01:13:04.373
Thank you. Yep. Thank you.

01:13:04.457 --> 01:13:07.166
I remember taking a step
and looking down.

01:13:07.251 --> 01:13:10.378
Just as I'm thinking, "There's that
ditch Abbie was talking about,"

01:13:10.462 --> 01:13:12.965
bam, I'm in the fucking ditch,
you know?

01:13:13.049 --> 01:13:14.550
What happened?

01:13:14.634 --> 01:13:17.969
what, with Zoë the cat?
Nothing.

01:13:18.053 --> 01:13:19.845
If I fell in that fucking thing,

01:13:19.930 --> 01:13:21.931
they would've had to
helicopter me out of there.

01:13:22.015 --> 01:13:24.559
Zoë just lands on her feet.

01:13:24.643 --> 01:13:28.062
But then, later, I started feeling
a little bad about myself.

01:13:28.146 --> 01:13:31.941
Zoë falls in the ditch,
and it's nothing.

01:13:32.025 --> 01:13:33.776
We're laughing about it.

01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:35.988
If I fell in that fucking thing,

01:13:36.072 --> 01:13:37.905
I probably would've been
fucking paralyzed.

01:13:37.990 --> 01:13:39.574
Oh, honey, you can't think like that.

01:13:39.658 --> 01:13:42.201
You know, we all have
our individual talents,

01:13:42.286 --> 01:13:43.954
and that just happens
to be one of Zoë's.

01:13:44.038 --> 01:13:45.789
- Yeah.
- Well ...

01:13:45.873 --> 01:13:48.791
physically speaking, Zoë is amazing.

01:13:48.875 --> 01:13:52.254
I mean, agility, reflexes, nimbleness.

01:13:52.338 --> 01:13:55.173
There's few human beings
that can fuck with Zoë on that front.

01:13:55.258 --> 01:13:57.466
Oh, Kim, I like you, too.

01:13:58.760 --> 01:14:00.429
Having said that,

01:14:00.513 --> 01:14:03.223
before you get too envious
of Zoë's prowess,

01:14:03.308 --> 01:14:06.059
you're missing the most important
part of that story.

01:14:06.144 --> 01:14:09.438
You didn't fall in the ditch,
Zoë did.

01:14:09.522 --> 01:14:13.400
Zoë even knew there was a ditch there
because you told her,

01:14:13.484 --> 01:14:15.528
and she still fell in.

01:14:15.613 --> 01:14:18.614
So, Lee's right.
We all have our talents.

01:14:18.698 --> 01:14:21.867
Hey, I resemble that remark.

01:14:25.038 --> 01:14:27.247
So, Kim,
you still pack a roscoe?

01:14:30.375 --> 01:14:32.461
Check it out, bitch.

01:14:32.545 --> 01:14:34.880
- Ooh, nice one, mate.
- I know this.

01:14:34.964 --> 01:14:37.883
- What's a roscoe?
- A roscoe is a pistol.

01:14:37.967 --> 01:14:40.427
- You carry a gun?
- Uh-huh.

01:14:40.511 --> 01:14:43.347
- You have a license to carry it?
- Yeah.

01:14:43.431 --> 01:14:46.725
when I became a Secret Service agent,
they gave me a license.

01:14:46.809 --> 01:14:49.228
Oh, I didn't know you were --

01:14:51.314 --> 01:14:54.775
Okay, I didn't say it, all right?
Stop looking at me. I didn't say it.

01:14:54.859 --> 01:14:56.653
God!

01:14:56.737 --> 01:14:58.655
Did you know Kim carried a gun?

01:14:58.739 --> 01:15:02.741
Yes. Now, do I approve? No.

01:15:02.825 --> 01:15:04.827
Do I know? Yes.

01:15:04.912 --> 01:15:08.706
Look, I don't know what
futuristic utopia you live in,

01:15:08.791 --> 01:15:11.501
but the world I live in,
a bitch need a gun.

01:15:11.585 --> 01:15:15.421
You can't get around the fact
that people who carry guns

01:15:15.506 --> 01:15:18.007
tend to get shot
more than people who don't.

01:15:18.092 --> 01:15:20.344
And you can't get around the fact
that if I go down

01:15:20.428 --> 01:15:23.054
to the laundry room in my building
at midnight enough times,

01:15:23.138 --> 01:15:24.972
I might get my ass raped.

01:15:25.057 --> 01:15:26.849
Don't do your laundry at midnight.

01:15:26.934 --> 01:15:30.478
Fuck that. I wanna do my laundry
whenever the fuck I wanna do my laundry.

01:15:30.562 --> 01:15:33.522
There are other things
you can carry other than a gun.

01:15:33.606 --> 01:15:35.066
Pepper spray.

01:15:35.150 --> 01:15:39.320
Uh, motherfucker try to rape me,
I don't wanna give him a skin rash.

01:15:39.405 --> 01:15:41.738
I wanna shut that nigga down.

01:15:43.033 --> 01:15:45.243
How about a knife at least?

01:15:45.327 --> 01:15:48.496
Yeah. You know what happens
to motherfuckers carry knives?

01:15:49.498 --> 01:15:51.542
They get shot!

01:15:51.626 --> 01:15:54.377
Look, if I ever become
a famous actress,

01:15:54.461 --> 01:15:55.920
I won't carry a gun.

01:15:56.004 --> 01:15:58.507
I'll hire me a do-dirt nigga,
and he'll carry the gun.

01:15:58.591 --> 01:16:00.426
And when shit goes down,
I'll sit back and laugh.

01:16:00.510 --> 01:16:03.344
But until that day,
it's wild West, motherfucker.

01:16:03.429 --> 01:16:06.765
So, Zoë, you thought about
what you want to do first?

01:16:08.184 --> 01:16:11.812
It just so happens
I know exactly what I wanna do.

01:16:11.896 --> 01:16:13.563
Oh, really?

01:16:13.647 --> 01:16:15.482
And what would that be?

01:16:15.567 --> 01:16:17.735
To me, there's no point
in being in America

01:16:17.819 --> 01:16:19.903
unless you can drive
a Detroit muscle car.

01:16:19.988 --> 01:16:22.072
And I wanna drive a Dodge Challenger.

01:16:22.157 --> 01:16:25.534
Fuck me swinging, balls out.

01:16:26.745 --> 01:16:30.080
Um, well, I guess we
can talk to Transpo.

01:16:30.165 --> 01:16:32.458
But does it have to be
a Dodge Challenger?

01:16:32.542 --> 01:16:33.750
Not just that.

01:16:33.834 --> 01:16:37.962
It has to be a 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a 440 engine.

01:16:40.675 --> 01:16:43.885
How in the fuck do
you expect to do that?

01:16:43.969 --> 01:16:45.762
No worries, mate.

01:16:45.846 --> 01:16:47.848
I've got it all worked out.

01:16:47.932 --> 01:16:50.976
When I knew I was coming here,
I went online and found out

01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:54.813
that the local paper here in Tennessee
is the Lebanon News Sentinel.

01:16:54.898 --> 01:16:56.774
- So, back home --
- I'm sorry. Where's home?

01:16:56.858 --> 01:16:58.484
Australia, right?

01:17:00.195 --> 01:17:02.238
What do you mean by that, mate?

01:17:02.323 --> 01:17:05.616
Zoë's from New Zealand,
and you never --

01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:09.369
I repeat, never --
call a Kiwi an Aussie.

01:17:09.454 --> 01:17:13.249
That is, unless you want
your ass kicked.

01:17:13.334 --> 01:17:15.375
I'm so sorry.
I really am.

01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:18.171
Oh, it's okay.

01:17:18.255 --> 01:17:21.508
we're just taking the piss
out of you, mate.

01:17:21.592 --> 01:17:24.636
Auckland, to answer your question.

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:27.514
Anyway, I subscribed
to the local paper a month ago.

01:17:27.598 --> 01:17:31.100
Now, why the fuck you want a local
redneck newspaper in New Zealand?

01:17:31.185 --> 01:17:33.686
Pipe down, and I'll tell you.

01:17:33.813 --> 01:17:35.647
I've been getting the paper
for the last month,

01:17:35.731 --> 01:17:38.357
and I've been checking the classified
at the back, looking at cars for sale.

01:17:38.441 --> 01:17:41.068
So, as of yesterday,

01:17:41.152 --> 01:17:43.404
for sale, in this town,

01:17:43.489 --> 01:17:46.657
some dude is selling a stock
1970 Dodge Challenger

01:17:46.741 --> 01:17:50.620
with a 440 engine
and a white paint job.

01:17:50.704 --> 01:17:53.373
And you wanna buy it?

01:17:53.457 --> 01:17:57.501
Kim, I may be stupid,
but I'm not bloody stupid.

01:17:57.586 --> 01:18:01.339
I wanna say I wanna buy it,
so he'll let me test-drive it.

01:18:01.423 --> 01:18:04.801
A 1970 Dodge Challenger
with a white paint job.

01:18:04.885 --> 01:18:07.929
- Oh, uh, Kowalski.
- Kowalski from Vanishing Point.

01:18:08.013 --> 01:18:10.515
- Mate, it's a fucking classic!
- Mmm, I get it.

01:18:10.599 --> 01:18:12.851
If I can get this guy
to let me drive it without him,

01:18:12.935 --> 01:18:15.479
I will blow the doors off that bitch.

01:18:15.564 --> 01:18:18.439
- What's Vanishing Point?
- Oh, God.

01:18:18.524 --> 01:18:20.567
"What's Vanishing Point?"

01:18:20.651 --> 01:18:23.696
Abs, I'm supposed to be
the illiterate one.

01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:26.490
It's just one of the best
American movies ever made.

01:18:26.575 --> 01:18:30.995
Actually, Zoë, most girls
wouldn't know Vanishing Point.

01:18:31.079 --> 01:18:33.664
Excuse me. "Most girls"?

01:18:33.748 --> 01:18:35.624
What the fuck are you two?

01:18:35.709 --> 01:18:38.877
Yeah, well, we're gearheads.
Of course we watched it.

01:18:38.961 --> 01:18:41.004
Y'all grew up watching
that Pretty in Pink shit.

01:18:41.088 --> 01:18:43.715
Oh, I like Pretty in Pink.

01:18:43.799 --> 01:18:46.302
what, so you didn't watch
John Hughes movies?

01:18:46.386 --> 01:18:48.387
Of course I did.
I'm a girl.

01:18:48.471 --> 01:18:50.513
But I also watched car shit, too.

01:18:50.598 --> 01:18:51.879
Vanishing Point, Dirty
Mary Crazy Larry ...

01:18:51.892 --> 01:18:53.183
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:18:53.268 --> 01:18:54.894
Gone in 60 Seconds --

01:18:54.978 --> 01:18:57.605
The real one,
not that Angelina Jolie bullshit.

01:18:57.689 --> 01:18:59.898
We have an outdoors theater
in Auckland.

01:18:59.982 --> 01:19:02.568
It plays Vanishing Point,
Big Wednesday,

01:19:02.652 --> 01:19:05.237
all the classics.

01:19:20.921 --> 01:19:22.546
What do you horny gals want?

01:19:26.469 --> 01:19:29.554
Hey, you got a 1970
Dodge Challenger for sale?

01:19:29.639 --> 01:19:31.931
Right up here, ladies.

01:19:45.779 --> 01:19:48.698
This shit is off the fucking hook!

01:19:48.783 --> 01:19:52.451
Fucking legendary, mate.

01:19:53.536 --> 01:19:56.790
Sweet ass. Well, if you'll
excuse me for a moment,

01:19:56.874 --> 01:19:59.000
I'd just like to have a word alone
with my business associate.

01:19:59.085 --> 01:20:01.419
- You ladies take your time.
- Okay.

01:20:03.880 --> 01:20:05.382
Mmm.

01:20:07.468 --> 01:20:10.220
What are you waiting for?
Ask him to let you drive it by yourself.

01:20:10.304 --> 01:20:13.098
I -- I intend to, but first,
I need to ask you something.

01:20:13.182 --> 01:20:14.432
What?

01:20:14.517 --> 01:20:19.437
If he lets us take it out on our own,
I wanna play ship's mast.

01:20:19.522 --> 01:20:21.357
- Oh, hell, no!
- Would you keep it down?

01:20:21.441 --> 01:20:23.650
- Ain't no way I'm doing ship's mast.
- For Christ sakes --

01:20:23.734 --> 01:20:25.610
- Don't blaspheme.
- Sorry.

01:20:25.695 --> 01:20:28.614
Now, what did you say
after the last time?

01:20:28.699 --> 01:20:31.826
- Look, I know what I said --
- What did you say?

01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:33.441
- I know I said we
shouldn't do this again --

01:20:33.454 --> 01:20:34.995
- No. You didn't
say we shouldn't.

01:20:35.079 --> 01:20:36.831
You said we ain't ever
gonna do that again.

01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:39.000
- Yeah, but --
- "But," my ass!

01:20:39.084 --> 01:20:42.086
You said not only are we never
gonna play ship's mast again,

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:45.046
but you also said if you ever do
what you trying to do now

01:20:45.131 --> 01:20:47.590
to not only refuse,
but that I had permission

01:20:47.675 --> 01:20:50.218
to physically restrain
your ass if necessary.

01:20:50.302 --> 01:20:52.555
Now, did you
or did you not say that?

01:20:52.639 --> 01:20:54.347
- Well --
- No, no, no, no.

01:20:54.432 --> 01:20:56.224
Answer the question,
motherfucker.

01:20:56.308 --> 01:20:58.018
Did you or did you not say that?

01:20:58.102 --> 01:21:00.229
Yes, I said that.
However --

01:21:00.313 --> 01:21:01.689
Whatever with your "however."

01:21:01.773 --> 01:21:05.734
Look, I know I said it,
and I know I meant it --

01:21:05.818 --> 01:21:06.818
Damn skippy you meant it.

01:21:06.902 --> 01:21:09.780
Yeah, but when I said it,
I didn't mean in America.

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:11.866
- Oh, nigga, please!
- Really --

01:21:11.950 --> 01:21:13.868
I meant we should never play
ship's mast again

01:21:13.952 --> 01:21:16.037
in New Zealand or Australia.

01:21:16.121 --> 01:21:18.122
You are such a liar.

01:21:18.206 --> 01:21:20.875
Look, I know what I said
when I said it.

01:21:20.959 --> 01:21:23.377
But when I said it, I didn't know
I'd ever come to America.

01:21:23.462 --> 01:21:26.130
And when I said it, if I had known
I was going to come to America

01:21:26.214 --> 01:21:27.882
and had the opportunity
to play ship's mast

01:21:27.966 --> 01:21:30.885
with a fucking
Vanishing Point Challenger,

01:21:30.969 --> 01:21:33.180
I would've added a "however."

01:21:33.264 --> 01:21:35.098
Right?

01:21:40.063 --> 01:21:43.065
Okay, oddly enough,
I actually understood that.

01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:47.359
However, just because you
talked yourself into some stupid shit

01:21:47.444 --> 01:21:49.653
doesn't mean I have lost
my goddamn mind.

01:21:49.738 --> 01:21:52.531
You need two people
to play ship's mast, and I ain't playing.

01:22:00.290 --> 01:22:02.291
I'll be your best friend.

01:22:02.375 --> 01:22:05.420
I don't need me no best friend
lives on the other side of planet Earth.

01:22:05.505 --> 01:22:08.255
- I'll crack your back.
- You'll crack it anyway.

01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:10.925
Well, of course I'll crack it anyway.

01:22:11.009 --> 01:22:14.805
But now, while I'm here,
I'll be your back-cracking slave.

01:22:14.889 --> 01:22:17.681
Whenever you want it, you got it.
You don't even have to ask for it.

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:19.601
You just order me to do it.
Just be, like ...

01:22:19.685 --> 01:22:21.937
"Bitch, get over here and get busy."

01:22:28.528 --> 01:22:30.529
- You crack my back,
you'll give me foot massages ...
- Mm-hmm. Mmm.

01:22:30.613 --> 01:22:33.865
and after a shower,
you put moisturizer on my butt.

01:22:33.950 --> 01:22:36.786
Deal.

01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:39.621
So, we're gonna see if this guy'll
let us take the car out without him.

01:22:39.705 --> 01:22:42.707
If he does, you wait here with Lee,
and we'll be back in a moment.

01:22:42.792 --> 01:22:44.293
What?

01:22:44.378 --> 01:22:47.296
I said, we're gonna see if this guy'll
let us take the car out without him --

01:22:47.381 --> 01:22:48.964
I heard what you said.

01:22:49.048 --> 01:22:52.342
I just can't believe what you said.

01:22:53.719 --> 01:22:55.345
You know, you two got
some fucking balls.

01:22:55.429 --> 01:22:56.847
What?

01:22:56.931 --> 01:22:58.681
Don't play dumbass with me.

01:22:58.765 --> 01:23:00.392
I've been up all night.

01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:03.770
I'm still a little drunk
and I have a hangover.

01:23:03.855 --> 01:23:07.233
I should be in my hotel room asleep,
not fucking around here on Tobacco Road.

01:23:07.317 --> 01:23:11.194
But because Zoë wanted to drive
some fucking Vanishing Point car, I'm here.

01:23:11.279 --> 01:23:14.364
Now you two got the balls
to ask me -- no, scratch that --

01:23:14.448 --> 01:23:17.493
tell me I gotta go make
conversation with Tom Joad

01:23:17.578 --> 01:23:19.536
while the cool kids
get to go out and play?

01:23:19.620 --> 01:23:21.413
Bullshit on that.

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:23.708
- It ain't like that.
- Then what's it like, Kim?

01:23:23.792 --> 01:23:25.418
You guys are our collateral.

01:23:25.502 --> 01:23:27.879
He is never gonna go for it
if we all go.

01:23:27.963 --> 01:23:31.799
I really think one human being
will be collateral enough.

01:23:31.884 --> 01:23:34.010
You're not gonna wanna do
what we're doing.

01:23:34.094 --> 01:23:35.636
What, drive a car?

01:23:35.721 --> 01:23:37.805
- Mmm.
- We're doing more than that.

01:23:37.890 --> 01:23:39.725
what, drive it fast?

01:23:39.809 --> 01:23:42.602
We're doing more than that.

01:23:42.686 --> 01:23:45.021
Actually,
we're paying you a compliment,

01:23:45.105 --> 01:23:47.232
'cause we gonna do
some stupid shit.

01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.652
But that's okay. We're stunt people.
We ain't got good sense.

01:23:51.737 --> 01:23:52.820
But you got good sense,

01:23:52.905 --> 01:23:55.531
and anybody with good sense
ain't gonna wanna do what we're doing.

01:23:55.616 --> 01:23:57.241
How do you know
I don't wanna do it?

01:23:57.326 --> 01:24:00.745
- 'Cause you're a mom.
- Yeah.

01:24:03.790 --> 01:24:06.209
You know, we're supposed
to be this big posse,

01:24:06.293 --> 01:24:07.710
but that's the excuse you guys use

01:24:07.794 --> 01:24:10.213
whenever you want
to exclude me from something.

01:24:10.297 --> 01:24:15.218
So, what is it you two daredevils
are doing that I'm just so uncool,

01:24:15.302 --> 01:24:17.553
I couldn't possibly understand?

01:24:17.638 --> 01:24:20.224
You know,
we're kind of conning this guy,

01:24:20.308 --> 01:24:23.935
so maybe it's best that we don't go into
detail about it while he's watching us.

01:24:24.019 --> 01:24:28.732
Besides, he's probably not
gonna let us do it anyway.

01:24:31.653 --> 01:24:35.447
Okay. How about this?

01:24:35.531 --> 01:24:36.657
I'll talk him into it.

01:24:36.741 --> 01:24:38.659
But if I talk him into it, I go along.

01:24:39.994 --> 01:24:43.247
- How you gonna do that?
- Eh, that's my problem.

01:24:43.331 --> 01:24:45.290
But don't worry.

01:24:45.375 --> 01:24:47.501
He'll say yes.

01:24:47.585 --> 01:24:49.253
What are you gonna do,
blow him?

01:24:49.337 --> 01:24:52.257
No!

01:24:52.341 --> 01:24:54.841
I'm gonna insinuate
that Lee's gonna blow him.

01:24:58.763 --> 01:25:00.931
That's good.

01:25:01.015 --> 01:25:03.183
Not really.

01:25:03.268 --> 01:25:06.478
But let me handle it.
We got a deal?

01:25:10.566 --> 01:25:12.276
Okay, Mommy, listen up.

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:14.528
You wanna hang with the cool kids,

01:25:14.612 --> 01:25:16.280
you got to be cool.

01:25:16.364 --> 01:25:17.864
we take you along,
you don't say shit.

01:25:17.949 --> 01:25:18.949
You don't even say crap.

01:25:19.033 --> 01:25:20.701
You just sit in the back,
and I don't wanna hear

01:25:20.785 --> 01:25:22.036
a peep out of your ass,
you understand?

01:25:22.121 --> 01:25:23.496
- Got it.
- I'm serious now.

01:25:23.580 --> 01:25:25.414
You start nagging us,
we're pulling over to the side of the road,

01:25:25.498 --> 01:25:27.457
kicking your ass out
and picking you up later.

01:25:27.542 --> 01:25:29.376
Agreed.

01:25:33.048 --> 01:25:35.966
Okay. Go work your magic.

01:25:42.474 --> 01:25:44.309
- Hello, sir.
- Hello!

01:25:44.393 --> 01:25:45.809
- Hello. What's your name?
- Jasper.

01:25:45.894 --> 01:25:47.520
Hello, Jasper.
I'm Abernathy.

01:25:47.604 --> 01:25:49.230
- Aber -- what?
- Abernathy.

01:25:49.315 --> 01:25:51.691
- What's your first name?
- That is my first name.

01:25:51.775 --> 01:25:53.401
What kind of first name is that?

01:25:53.485 --> 01:25:55.321
You know what?
Just call me Abbie.

01:25:55.405 --> 01:25:57.864
Okay, Abbie.

01:25:57.948 --> 01:26:00.658
Jasper, we were wondering
if my friends and I

01:26:00.743 --> 01:26:02.910
could take the car out
for a little test-drive out on our own.

01:26:02.995 --> 01:26:04.662
You know, just to see
if we're comfortable in it.

01:26:04.747 --> 01:26:06.496
Why would I do
something stupid like that?

01:26:06.581 --> 01:26:08.874
To better sell your automobile.

01:26:08.958 --> 01:26:11.169
How do I know y'all ain't
just gonna steal it?

01:26:11.253 --> 01:26:13.504
Four reasons, actually.

01:26:13.589 --> 01:26:15.715
One, we're not thieves.

01:26:15.799 --> 01:26:18.509
Two, that would be rude.

01:26:18.594 --> 01:26:20.720
Three, we're staying
at the Days Inn in town.

01:26:20.804 --> 01:26:22.555
You can call the hotel,
check with management.

01:26:22.639 --> 01:26:24.307
We're registered
for the next month.

01:26:24.391 --> 01:26:26.352
Actually, Zoë's not.

01:26:26.436 --> 01:26:29.103
But Kim and I are,
so we're totally track-downable.

01:26:29.188 --> 01:26:30.897
Who's Kim? The colored girl?

01:26:31.982 --> 01:26:35.361
Yes. Kim would be
the girl of color.

01:26:35.445 --> 01:26:38.071
And reason number four,
and the most important,

01:26:38.155 --> 01:26:40.823
while we're taking the car out
for a little spin,

01:26:40.908 --> 01:26:43.869
that'll give you a better opportunity
to get acquainted

01:26:43.953 --> 01:26:47.331
with our other friend, Lee.

01:26:50.502 --> 01:26:52.878
Why does she look kind of familiar?

01:26:52.962 --> 01:26:55.839
That would be because
she's a famous actress.

01:26:55.924 --> 01:26:57.926
Oh.

01:26:58.009 --> 01:26:59.385
Why is she dressed like that?

01:26:59.469 --> 01:27:02.596
well, you see, we're making
a Hollywood movie in town,

01:27:02.680 --> 01:27:05.724
and it's a cheerleader movie,
and she's one of the cheerleaders.

01:27:05.809 --> 01:27:07.559
What's a cheerleader movie?

01:27:07.644 --> 01:27:10.186
A movie about cheerleaders.

01:27:10.270 --> 01:27:11.604
Is it a porno movie?

01:27:13.107 --> 01:27:15.776
Yes, it is.

01:27:15.860 --> 01:27:18.445
But don't mention it.

01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:20.822
She's shy.

01:27:23.576 --> 01:27:26.912
Lee, this is Jasper.
Jasper, Lee.

01:27:26.996 --> 01:27:28.998
Now, you two kids
stay out of trouble.

01:27:29.083 --> 01:27:32.209
Hey, good-lookin',
be back to pick you up later.

01:27:32.293 --> 01:27:34.128
Ta-ta!

01:27:43.555 --> 01:27:45.432
Gulp.

01:28:00.281 --> 01:28:02.740
You thinking what I'm thinking?

01:28:02.825 --> 01:28:04.451
I think I'm thinking it.

01:28:04.535 --> 01:28:05.994
What are you and you thinking?

01:28:06.078 --> 01:28:09.414
I'm thinking we told your ass
to shut the fuck up.

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:14.668
- Where y'all going?
- You stay put.

01:28:14.752 --> 01:28:16.713
I gotta take a --

01:28:33.147 --> 01:28:36.107
So, you ready to do this?

01:28:36.192 --> 01:28:37.609
You sure?

01:28:37.693 --> 01:28:40.946
well, I always don't wanna do it
right before I'm gonna do it.

01:28:41.031 --> 01:28:42.031
You know what I mean?

01:28:42.114 --> 01:28:44.532
Yeah, I know what you mean,
'cause I don't wanna do it.

01:28:44.617 --> 01:28:46.743
- Kim ...
- I'm just saying.

01:28:46.827 --> 01:28:48.496
Look, if you're gonna take
the piss out of it --

01:28:48.580 --> 01:28:50.206
I'm just saying.

01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:53.750
You wanna start out on top?

01:28:54.835 --> 01:28:58.672
Practically doesn't count
if you start on the top.

01:29:02.511 --> 01:29:05.554
Here are your gloves.

01:29:11.895 --> 01:29:14.812
No, no, no, no.
I'm wearing the jacket.

01:29:14.897 --> 01:29:16.606
This is my jacket.

01:29:16.690 --> 01:29:21.070
Um, ain't you 'posed to be
my slave or some shit?

01:29:21.154 --> 01:29:24.197
- Come on.
- I'm the one who's on the fucking bonnet!

01:29:24.281 --> 01:29:27.242
"Bonnet," my ass.
You on the hood.

01:29:35.876 --> 01:29:38.212
Y'all, I think I hear a car coming!

01:29:38.296 --> 01:29:39.922
Give me your belt.

01:29:40.006 --> 01:29:41.423
Oh.

01:29:44.095 --> 01:29:47.054
But this is my cute shit.

01:29:47.138 --> 01:29:48.264
- Well --
- Fuck that.

01:29:48.348 --> 01:29:50.808
Get Abernathy's belt.

01:29:50.892 --> 01:29:52.894
Fine. We'll use Abbie's belt.

01:29:57.857 --> 01:30:00.277
- Give me your belt.
- No.

01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:02.737
- Prada.
- Come on, give her the belt.

01:30:02.822 --> 01:30:04.739
Magic word.

01:30:04.824 --> 01:30:06.907
Please give her the belt.

01:30:06.992 --> 01:30:09.578
Just 'cause you asked nicely.

01:30:12.331 --> 01:30:15.584
- It's nice to be nice, Kim!
- Whatever.

01:30:15.668 --> 01:30:16.834
You know what?

01:30:16.918 --> 01:30:20.087
Don't even fucking think about asking me
next time you want me to do your hair.

01:30:20.171 --> 01:30:21.171
Your ass gonna do it.

01:30:21.256 --> 01:30:22.590
Yeah, and you'll ask
"pretty please," bitch,

01:30:22.674 --> 01:30:24.426
because that's what you do
when no one else is looking.

01:30:24.510 --> 01:30:25.594
You ain't that fucking hard.

01:30:25.678 --> 01:30:26.802
I ain't getting that shit.

01:30:26.886 --> 01:30:29.346
Abernathy, don't get
on my nerves right now.

01:30:29.431 --> 01:30:30.472
I got shit on my mind.

01:30:30.599 --> 01:30:32.183
Ooh!

01:30:32.268 --> 01:30:34.269
You know, I ain't six.

01:30:48.117 --> 01:30:49.951
It's cold. Can we roll up
one of these windows?

01:30:50.036 --> 01:30:52.287
No.

01:30:52.371 --> 01:30:55.875
Okay, Abernathy.
Check this out.

01:31:07.554 --> 01:31:09.721
What the fuck are you guys doing?

01:31:18.023 --> 01:31:20.023
What does that mean?

01:31:21.651 --> 01:31:23.818
Whoa.

01:31:27.949 --> 01:31:30.659
Faster, you black bitch! Faster!

01:31:38.502 --> 01:31:40.669
Is that fast enough
for your bony ass?

01:31:40.753 --> 01:31:42.796
Whoohoo!

01:31:42.880 --> 01:31:45.174
Whoa-ho-ho-ho!

01:31:49.054 --> 01:31:51.597
Abernathy, get your ass up here.

01:31:58.940 --> 01:32:00.523
All righty.

01:32:00.607 --> 01:32:03.401
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:32:14.496 --> 01:32:16.707
Go, go, go!

01:32:16.791 --> 01:32:19.459
Check it out, bitch.
You want it fucking faster?

01:33:34.994 --> 01:33:38.705
- Oh, my God.

01:33:41.292 --> 01:33:43.252
Zoë!

01:33:44.962 --> 01:33:46.838

01:33:57.141 --> 01:33:58.351
Did you do something to him?

01:33:58.435 --> 01:34:00.561
- Did you say something?
- Nothing! Nothing!

01:34:00.646 --> 01:34:01.771
Shit!

01:34:01.855 --> 01:34:02.939

01:34:09.822 --> 01:34:12.031
- Whoa.

01:34:21.291 --> 01:34:23.335
Oh, my God! Zoë!

01:34:23.419 --> 01:34:25.629
- Oh! Hold on!

01:34:27.130 --> 01:34:29.841
Whoo!

Fuck you, motherfucker!

01:34:32.845 --> 01:34:35.221
Zoë! Zoë!

01:34:36.764 --> 01:34:39.684
- I'm sorry I called you a black bitch!
- I forgive you! Now hold the fuck on!

01:34:39.768 --> 01:34:41.853
Whoa! Whoa! Get away!

01:34:44.189 --> 01:34:46.858
Oh, shit!
