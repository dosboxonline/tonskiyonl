WEBVTT

01:15.700 --> 01:17.160
(dramatic music playing)

01:19.496 --> 01:21.289
(roaring in demonic voice)

01:24.584 --> 01:25.669
(laughing maniacally)

01:25.794 --> 01:26.628
(electricity buzzing)

01:26.711 --> 01:27.754
(roars angrily)

01:28.213 --> 01:29.047
(exploding)

01:29.714 --> 01:30.548
(all grunting)

01:30.924 --> 01:31.758
(thudding)

01:32.842 --> 01:33.968
(Immortus roaring)

01:45.604 --> 01:46.731
(Butts snarling)

01:46.815 --> 01:49.818
So, what's first?
Immortus or Butts?

01:49.901 --> 01:51.860
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:52.570 --> 01:54.030
-(wings flapping)
-(Cliff) Hey!

01:54.239 --> 01:58.033
Fleeing isn't one of the options.
God damn it!

01:59.411 --> 02:01.162
You're back? How?

02:01.371 --> 02:03.164
Might as well start
with the screaming time god.

02:03.498 --> 02:06.960
Ooh, you guys are so annoying.

02:07.544 --> 02:09.294
(screaming)

02:10.045 --> 02:11.297
(Cliff) Whoa, Flit's back.

02:11.715 --> 02:12.674
That wasn't Flit.

02:13.258 --> 02:14.092
That was me.

02:14.509 --> 02:15.802
Uh, what?

02:16.094 --> 02:17.137
(Kay in Jane's head)
We're all here now.

02:18.221 --> 02:19.639
All together as one.

02:20.557 --> 02:21.391
What?

02:22.183 --> 02:23.018
(whooshing)

02:23.101 --> 02:23.935
(gasping)

02:24.602 --> 02:26.146
Holy fucking shit!

02:27.814 --> 02:30.442
Lady, you just picked the wrong fight.

02:31.901 --> 02:33.069
-(grunts)
-(screams)

02:33.403 --> 02:34.696
(Cliff) Holy shit!

02:34.904 --> 02:35.739
(roars)

02:37.699 --> 02:38.533
(grunts)

02:39.242 --> 02:40.994
(Larry) Keeg, go. (grunts)

02:42.120 --> 02:43.246
(roaring)

02:45.707 --> 02:46.666
Hey, Zuul!

02:46.875 --> 02:48.710
(straining) Have a seat!

02:48.793 --> 02:49.627
(machinery winding down)

02:49.793 --> 02:52.130
-Uh, oh, shit!
-(creaking)

02:52.213 --> 02:54.299
-No, no, no!
-(Larry gasping)

02:54.382 --> 02:55.800
-(crashes)
-(Cliff grunts) Fuck!

02:56.091 --> 02:59.637
If anybody hasn't noticed,
we're aging more than ever.

03:06.353 --> 03:07.604
Oh, thanks, bud.

03:07.687 --> 03:08.772
(Immortus laughing)

03:09.814 --> 03:11.274
(Immortus cackling)

03:12.734 --> 03:15.779
(Cliff) Hey, you got a knockoff
Willoughby sword.

03:16.237 --> 03:17.364
This is no knockoff.

03:18.490 --> 03:19.574
(grunting)

03:21.701 --> 03:22.869
(screaming)

03:24.788 --> 03:25.622
Ahhh!

03:26.748 --> 03:28.708
Rita. Rita, please.
I need to talk.

03:28.792 --> 03:29.751
It's happening again.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.961
No matter how hard I try,
no matter what I do,

03:32.045 --> 03:34.381
I can't escape this fucking fate.

03:36.007 --> 03:36.841
Pardon?

03:37.216 --> 03:38.259
Here I am,

03:38.343 --> 03:41.054
about to be the sole survivor
of yet another super team,

03:41.137 --> 03:42.597
and it's all my fault.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.974
Slow down. What's going on?

03:45.058 --> 03:46.976
They're... They're fighting Immortus.

03:47.185 --> 03:48.937
The Butts are about
to break into the theater,

03:49.020 --> 03:50.772
and they don't stand
a fucking chance.

03:50.855 --> 03:53.608
Wait, so, you just left them?

03:53.692 --> 03:55.527
Yeah, just ran away.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.612
Just like the future said I would.

03:57.696 --> 03:59.406
Because I survive at all costs.

03:59.489 --> 04:01.866
That's what I have
always fucking done.

04:01.950 --> 04:05.120
No, I refuse to accept that.

04:05.954 --> 04:10.166
(sighs) As long as we're alive,
we can change.

04:10.250 --> 04:13.086
You're a shape shifter,
for crying out loud.

04:13.169 --> 04:14.671
You of all people should know that.

04:14.754 --> 04:15.964
I'm a selfish coward.

04:16.589 --> 04:20.093
That seems to be the one thing
I can't shape shift away.

04:20.427 --> 04:22.387
So, why did you come here?

04:22.595 --> 04:23.888
Why did you wake me up?

04:24.514 --> 04:25.432
I don't know.

04:26.683 --> 04:27.517
Just...

04:28.018 --> 04:29.686
Having a bit of a freak out,
I suppose.

04:29.769 --> 04:33.481
You came here because you knew
I would hold you accountable.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.235
You are part of the Doom Patrol now.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.738
As long as we're a team,

04:39.821 --> 04:42.824
we will never stop
fighting for each other.

04:45.243 --> 04:48.496
So, go get my wheelchair.

04:49.497 --> 04:50.415
Okay.

04:51.541 --> 04:52.917
-You're the boss.
-Hmm.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.590
(objects clattering)

05:01.676 --> 05:03.345
(Cliff) Rip her face off, Jane.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.555
-(Butts growling)
-(Immortus laughing)

05:06.681 --> 05:09.684
You dum-dums should have stayed
in the time stream.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.394
(cackling)

05:13.813 --> 05:16.608
(whispers) Fuck off.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.195
(screaming)

05:24.074 --> 05:25.950
-(door crashes)
-(Butts snarling)

05:26.159 --> 05:27.452
What the fuck?

05:30.497 --> 05:31.414
Whoops.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.093
Kill them all!

05:43.301 --> 05:45.178
Oh, my God, are those butts?

05:46.096 --> 05:46.930
(screams)

05:47.889 --> 05:49.099
(Immortus) Go!

05:54.270 --> 05:55.105
(male voice singing)

05:57.190 --> 05:58.108
Wait, what is that?

05:59.234 --> 06:01.486
(Dr. Yu and Nicholas singing "Shipoopi")

06:01.653 --> 06:02.779
She's your Shipoopi

06:03.113 --> 06:05.573
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi

06:05.699 --> 06:07.158
That girl is hard to get

06:07.450 --> 06:10.036
Shipoopi, Shipoopi, Shipoopi

06:10.161 --> 06:12.414
Uh, what the fuck's
happening right now?

06:12.497 --> 06:14.499
(Nicholas) If you get a squeeze back
That's fancy cookin'

06:14.582 --> 06:16.084
Once more
In the flower garden

06:16.167 --> 06:17.877
She will never get sore
On her way to supper

06:17.961 --> 06:18.878
(big band music playing)

06:18.962 --> 06:19.838
(all singing)

06:19.921 --> 06:23.049
Do re mi fa so la ti do
Si do

06:23.299 --> 06:25.385
-Now little ole Sall's a no-gal
-(Immortus) No!

06:25.468 --> 06:26.428
Anyone can see

06:26.511 --> 06:27.345
No!

06:27.804 --> 06:31.182
This isn't your show,
this is my show!

06:31.725 --> 06:32.642
(Larry) What the hell?

06:33.893 --> 06:34.728
(piano music playing)

06:36.896 --> 06:38.565
(singing in normal voice) Possibilities

06:38.648 --> 06:42.068
That's right
I said possibilities

06:42.193 --> 06:44.988
Life's filled with
These opportunities

06:45.196 --> 06:48.950
And so is our town

06:49.784 --> 06:52.037
Wait. Is this song
from that musical about us?

06:52.287 --> 06:54.539
Statistical probabilities

06:55.248 --> 06:57.709
(Butts singing)
All sorts of potentialities

06:57.959 --> 07:01.254
Lift you up when you're down

07:02.088 --> 07:06.301
(Cliff) They say
Our story is ending

07:07.635 --> 07:10.013
Now we're all pretending

07:10.096 --> 07:11.056
Ugh.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.267
That our future is bright

07:14.351 --> 07:15.185
(Cliff) Just go with it.

07:15.268 --> 07:16.936
Whatever the fuck's happening,
it's working.

07:17.020 --> 07:21.066
Here, in the town of Cloverton

07:21.191 --> 07:22.067
Things are never...

07:22.150 --> 07:26.112
(fumbling for lyrics) ...over-ton

07:26.321 --> 07:28.990
(Cliff) Keep moving. Keep moving.

07:29.824 --> 07:32.659
(Immortus) Because our story's
Just beginning

07:33.078 --> 07:35.955
We're not losers
We're still winning

07:36.331 --> 07:37.624
We're the heroes

07:37.791 --> 07:41.920
And our future's up to us

07:42.837 --> 07:44.255
(Cliff) Go, go, go!

07:47.509 --> 07:48.468
(Larry) Is that the end of it?

07:48.885 --> 07:51.012
(Cliff) I don't know
what the fuck that was.

07:51.137 --> 07:51.971
(triumphant music playing)

07:56.183 --> 07:57.018
(whooshing)

07:57.310 --> 07:59.896
(Cliff) Oh, shit!

08:00.146 --> 08:00.980
(whooshing)

08:08.113 --> 08:09.072
(Madame Rouge) Whoo!

08:09.698 --> 08:12.409
Reinforcements have arrived!

08:35.265 --> 08:36.099
Oh...

08:38.434 --> 08:39.852
(whimsical electronic music playing)

08:48.194 --> 08:49.029
(grunts)

08:49.362 --> 08:51.239
(Cliff) Holy fuck-a-doodle-doo.

08:52.282 --> 08:56.036
I guess we can add vanquished
an interdimensional time god

08:56.119 --> 08:57.620
to our list of achievements.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.666
To us, the Doom Patrol!

09:02.334 --> 09:05.545
Mother fucking god slayers! Yeah!

09:05.628 --> 09:07.088
-(chuckles)
-(Larry) Hey, hey!

09:07.547 --> 09:08.506
(Larry) Well...

09:08.798 --> 09:11.509
I don't mean to be
a wet blanket, but, uh--

09:11.593 --> 09:14.763
"But it's basically
my entire personality."

09:14.846 --> 09:16.014
-(laughing)
-(all exclaiming)

09:16.097 --> 09:17.724
-Ooh, nice.
-Nice one.

09:17.807 --> 09:19.351
-(softly) Sorry.
-(Cliff) Rouge with the burn.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.061
(Larry) Okay, fine, fine.

09:21.144 --> 09:23.980
But as the resident
wet blanket of truth,

09:24.064 --> 09:26.399
I feel like it's my job
to point out,

09:26.608 --> 09:29.361
wasn't it actually the Butts
who saved the day?

09:29.611 --> 09:30.445
Oh, yeah.

09:30.862 --> 09:32.197
I mean, I took a couple
of blows to the head,

09:32.280 --> 09:34.449
but the Butts were singing, right?

09:34.908 --> 09:35.825
(Cliff) Yes, they were.

09:36.242 --> 09:38.745
-And what were they singing?
-Remind me.

09:38.828 --> 09:43.208
A musical number that wouldn't
have existed without us.

09:43.625 --> 09:45.960
Boom. Proverbial mic drop.

09:46.044 --> 09:47.170
(Larry) Sure, sure.

09:47.545 --> 09:49.214
-Although--
-(all groan)

09:49.297 --> 09:51.383
I'm sorry, but you realize

09:51.466 --> 09:53.885
we could say the same
about Immortus, right?

09:54.386 --> 09:57.430
Isabel wouldn't have become
an interdimensional time god

09:57.514 --> 10:00.308
if it wasn't for us crashing
into her in the first place.

10:00.517 --> 10:03.228
And the Butts wouldn't have
gotten out of the Ant Farm

10:03.311 --> 10:05.021
if it wasn't for us either.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.732
-Ergo--
-Why did I teach you that word?

10:07.816 --> 10:09.275
We saved the day.

10:09.359 --> 10:12.278
(Larry) But we didn't even
get our longevity back.

10:12.362 --> 10:14.614
-So what's the--
-A win is a win, dude.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.199
Let it go.

10:18.535 --> 10:19.369
(Larry sighs)

10:19.994 --> 10:21.913
-Here, here.
-(Cliff) Yeah!

10:21.996 --> 10:23.164
(Madame Rouge)
With our glasses raised

10:23.248 --> 10:25.417
-let's give Rita Farr a toast.
-(Rita) Mmm.

10:25.500 --> 10:26.584
(Madame Rouge)
It's good to have you back.

10:26.668 --> 10:29.045
Ah, it's good to be back. (chuckles)

10:29.796 --> 10:32.382
I hope I didn't
worry you all too much.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.092
This...

10:35.176 --> 10:36.511
(inhales and sighs)

10:37.554 --> 10:39.264
This feels nice.

10:40.515 --> 10:42.726
Just us here, hmm?

10:43.435 --> 10:44.352
Together.

10:49.482 --> 10:50.358
You know what?

10:51.234 --> 10:55.780
I'm going to go see
if I can squeeze into my old uniform,

10:56.239 --> 10:57.574
while we're celebrating.

10:58.199 --> 10:59.034
Hmm.

11:00.535 --> 11:01.369
Hmm.

11:02.829 --> 11:03.872
Hmm.

11:06.833 --> 11:07.667
(Vic clears throat)

11:10.170 --> 11:11.880
Rita, shall I give you a hand?

11:12.547 --> 11:14.966
Oh, stop it. (chuckles)

11:15.091 --> 11:18.428
This old girl can still dress herself,

11:19.262 --> 11:21.931
uh, and drink, all of you

11:22.349 --> 11:24.768
-under the table. Hmm?
-(all chuckling)

11:24.851 --> 11:29.189
But if you would like to be
of assistance, dear Laura,

11:29.272 --> 11:32.859
you can crack open
some of the good stuff

11:32.942 --> 11:35.403
and pour me a double.

11:36.738 --> 11:37.572
Copy that.

11:38.865 --> 11:39.908
Mmm-hmm.

11:41.159 --> 11:41.993
All right.

11:43.870 --> 11:44.788
Here I go.

11:53.505 --> 11:54.881
(Cliff) Speaking of comebacks...

11:55.465 --> 11:58.051
Looks like someone
sold a fuckload of Thin Mints.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.344
-(Jane chuckles)
-Hmm.

11:59.928 --> 12:00.845
They're reminders.

12:01.137 --> 12:01.971
Of what?

12:02.430 --> 12:06.267
Come on. Tell us about
your adorable bionic tattoos.

12:09.896 --> 12:11.272
I just felt like...

12:12.357 --> 12:14.359
if I was gonna put the suit
back on again...

12:15.235 --> 12:17.070
then it just had to be
a better reflection of me.

12:17.696 --> 12:18.697
Everything I've been through,

12:19.781 --> 12:21.991
all the things I've learned,
all the people I've learned from.

12:22.492 --> 12:23.493
So that's what these are.

12:24.035 --> 12:26.871
The people that made this
new version of Cyborg possible.

12:28.957 --> 12:29.791
Mom and dad.

12:30.625 --> 12:31.584
The Detroiticons.

12:33.962 --> 12:34.879
And you guys.

12:35.505 --> 12:36.339
(both) Aw!

12:36.423 --> 12:37.716
(Cliff) Wow, that's, uh...

12:37.924 --> 12:41.136
(snickers) That's so
goddamn corny, my dude.

12:41.302 --> 12:43.471
(laughing)

12:43.930 --> 12:45.432
You're around us all day.

12:45.515 --> 12:47.225
What do you need
a reminder of us for?

12:48.685 --> 12:50.645
All right.
Right, whatever. Uh...

12:51.396 --> 12:54.274
What about you, Jane?
What's with, uh, everything?

12:54.649 --> 12:56.192
Actually, I'm not sure.

12:57.861 --> 13:00.905
I'm still figuring things out.

13:01.197 --> 13:04.200
When you started flitting
and throwing balls of fire...

13:04.325 --> 13:06.453
Whoo! Girl boss alert!

13:06.536 --> 13:07.954
Man, that wasn't me.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.458
I mean, it wasn't just me.

13:13.043 --> 13:14.669
Right, this is
hard to explain, but...

13:16.212 --> 13:17.964
It's all of us up here now.

13:18.840 --> 13:20.091
The entire Underground...

13:20.967 --> 13:22.802
breathing, existing,

13:23.636 --> 13:24.554
all at once.

13:26.056 --> 13:27.891
I don't feel like just Jane anymore.

13:30.101 --> 13:32.520
(Larry) Well, if you're not just Jane,

13:33.730 --> 13:34.731
what should we call you?

13:38.485 --> 13:41.905
There's one word I keep hearing
in the back of my mind.

13:42.405 --> 13:43.323
Our minds.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.535
Kaleidoscope.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.331
But I guess it's kind of
a mouthful. (chuckles)

13:52.665 --> 13:55.251
What about K?

13:59.172 --> 14:00.048
I like that.

14:04.010 --> 14:04.844
(doorbell rings)

14:08.390 --> 14:10.975
(in normal voice) Hey, besties.

14:12.102 --> 14:13.019
(Cliff) What the fuck?

14:15.980 --> 14:18.858
Come, come.
Lots to tell, lots to tell.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.902
Let's see. Let's see.

14:21.778 --> 14:22.779
Well...

14:23.947 --> 14:26.866
Just completed a very successful tour,

14:26.950 --> 14:29.744
debuted my 10th platinum record.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.079
Ooh, guess what?

14:31.162 --> 14:34.374
Possibilities had
an incredible 1,000-year run.

14:34.708 --> 14:35.542
(laughs)

14:35.750 --> 14:37.669
Weren't you gone for an hour?

14:37.794 --> 14:39.713
(scoffs) Keep up Robo-hottie.

14:39.921 --> 14:42.048
Time works a little differently
in the time stream.

14:42.173 --> 14:43.341
Duh. (giggles)

14:43.925 --> 14:47.303
Anyway, I could not
go another decade

14:47.387 --> 14:51.349
without thanking you all
for introducing me to the Butts.

14:51.850 --> 14:55.478
The monologues they've written
for me, the songs. Oh!

14:55.812 --> 14:57.605
So... (vocalizes trumpet)

14:59.566 --> 15:00.400
Voila!

15:03.319 --> 15:04.154
Come on.

15:06.614 --> 15:07.532
Fingernails?

15:07.866 --> 15:08.950
(laughs hysterically)

15:10.827 --> 15:12.620
No, silly. Toenails.

15:13.288 --> 15:14.831
-Oh, great.
-(Immortus chuckles)

15:14.956 --> 15:16.791
There's one for each of you.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.209
Just eat one,

15:18.293 --> 15:22.464
and you'll be sad little
bags of old no more.

15:23.381 --> 15:24.466
-Eat?
-Mmm-hmm.

15:24.758 --> 15:25.592
A toenail?

15:25.842 --> 15:27.510
-Mmm-hmm
-To restore our youth?

15:27.594 --> 15:28.678
Fuck, yes! Gimme.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.055
-Gimme, gimme.
-(Larry) Hey, hey!

15:30.263 --> 15:31.389
All right, okay.

15:31.890 --> 15:32.724
(clicks tongue) Aw.

15:32.807 --> 15:33.725
(Cliff) This is gonna be amazing.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.060
I can go see Rory again.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.645
Everything'll be back to normal.
Holy shit!

15:37.729 --> 15:39.564
Get in my fucking feed hole!

15:39.898 --> 15:40.899
(chuckles)

15:41.399 --> 15:43.193
(Immortus) Oh. Almost forgot.

15:43.401 --> 15:47.072
I have one more thing
just for you, Cliffie.

15:51.868 --> 15:52.702
What is it?

15:53.787 --> 15:54.913
It'll make sense later.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.831
When the time is right.

15:57.957 --> 16:00.460
(in sing-song voice) Okay, bye.

16:00.835 --> 16:01.836
Bye-bye.

16:04.381 --> 16:05.215
(door closes)

16:07.676 --> 16:09.427
(Cliff) Holy shit!

16:09.511 --> 16:10.553
-Jane!
-Oh, shit.

16:11.262 --> 16:13.515
Yeah, okay. I'm gonna
take one for Rita.

16:13.598 --> 16:14.516
How does it feel?

16:18.436 --> 16:19.521
(Jane) Pretty good, I think.

16:20.021 --> 16:20.855
-(metal creaking)
-(Cliff) Ooh!

16:21.773 --> 16:22.774
I'm back, baby.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.567
Fucking tiger blood.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.486
(Madame Rouge screaming) No!

16:29.114 --> 16:30.490
(somber music playing)

16:42.711 --> 16:43.628
(Larry) Rita?

16:46.673 --> 16:47.507
She's...

16:48.633 --> 16:50.093
-She's...
-Oh, God.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.054
Rita. Hey. Hey.

16:55.181 --> 16:56.057
Oh, shit.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.351
(voice breaking) Shit, shit, shit.

16:58.435 --> 16:59.853
-Rita.
-Fuck.

17:01.312 --> 17:02.272
What do we do?

17:03.690 --> 17:04.898
(Cliff) We go get her.

17:05.442 --> 17:07.569
Screw it! We just got our shit back.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.779
We're the fucking Doom Patrol again.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.031
Let's go crush some
ugly fish headed fucks,

17:12.281 --> 17:13.742
flip off my dad,

17:13.907 --> 17:15.868
and pull Rita out
of Satan's ass crack.

17:16.578 --> 17:17.494
Who's with me?

17:18.413 --> 17:19.873
I'm in. I'm in.

17:20.165 --> 17:22.125
Satan's ass crack, right.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.837
But how do we do all of that, exactly?

17:25.920 --> 17:28.048
We need something of hers, a tether.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.300
Something Rita had
a strong connection to.

17:30.675 --> 17:31.593
I'll be right back.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.142
Oh, come on. Come on.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.643
What do you think, bud?

17:41.019 --> 17:42.270
Can you feel her on any of these?

17:43.104 --> 17:45.190
Vodka. Maybe the rum?

17:45.940 --> 17:47.067
(Rita in ghostly voice)
Is that what you think

17:47.150 --> 17:49.027
I have the strongest connection to?

17:59.079 --> 18:00.663
-Was there something else?
-(scoffs)

18:01.539 --> 18:03.375
Uh, don't worry, okay?
We're gonna come get you.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.001
Everything will be back to normal.

18:05.210 --> 18:06.711
See, Immortus just
gave us these toenails

18:06.795 --> 18:08.797
that made us all young again,
which sounds gross,

18:08.880 --> 18:10.840
-I know, but it really wasn't that bad.
-Larry.

18:11.049 --> 18:12.509
All this will just be a distant...

18:12.842 --> 18:14.386
(breathes shakily)

18:15.804 --> 18:16.721
nightmare.

18:17.305 --> 18:19.265
(inhales deeply and exhales)

18:21.351 --> 18:22.268
We can't give up.

18:23.478 --> 18:24.562
Don't make me give up.

18:24.646 --> 18:26.523
I'm so sorry, Larry.

18:28.525 --> 18:30.276
-It's not fair.
-I know.

18:30.360 --> 18:31.194
(sniffs)

18:36.282 --> 18:37.951
You're the only person who saw me.

18:40.537 --> 18:42.205
Right from the beginning, you...

18:42.997 --> 18:45.250
You saw the shitty
fucked up pieces of me,

18:45.333 --> 18:46.167
and you...

18:47.460 --> 18:48.503
You still loved me.

18:52.340 --> 18:53.800
Like I wasn't even broken at all.

18:58.680 --> 18:59.681
If you go...

19:00.432 --> 19:01.558
-If you--
-As someone

19:01.641 --> 19:03.351
who has loved and lost,

19:03.852 --> 19:06.271
I can tell you one thing for certain.

19:07.105 --> 19:10.984
There is always more love out there.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.695
Always.

19:15.530 --> 19:18.324
Especially for you.

19:19.492 --> 19:20.577
I promise.

19:29.544 --> 19:30.378
(exhales)

19:32.589 --> 19:33.423
(clicks tongue)

19:34.632 --> 19:37.677
I think it's time
for one last team meeting.

19:38.511 --> 19:39.346
(Larry sighs)

19:44.851 --> 19:47.520
Thank you all for gathering here today.

19:47.687 --> 19:51.024
(Cliff) Uh, Rita,
what are we doing sitting around talking?

19:51.149 --> 19:53.151
Let's go to the afterlife and save you.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.861
-Yes. Fuck, yes!
-(Vic) I'm game.

19:54.944 --> 19:56.488
(Madame Rouge)
Abso-fucking-lutely, yes.

19:56.571 --> 19:57.864
(clears throat)

19:59.366 --> 20:02.494
I have to admit, my life didn't pan out

20:02.577 --> 20:05.038
quite the way
young Gertrude Cramp dreamed.

20:05.538 --> 20:08.833
But because of all of you,
I have done things

20:08.917 --> 20:12.462
that little Gertrude
never could have imagined.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.590
Why does this sound like
the beginning of a farewell speech?

20:16.216 --> 20:18.009
Dying has a way...

20:19.094 --> 20:20.512
of clarifying things.

20:21.096 --> 20:23.640
I've realized now
what my life's purpose was.

20:24.265 --> 20:26.267
It was to lead you

20:26.601 --> 20:29.521
to the first step
of the rest of your lives.

20:30.105 --> 20:31.648
Mission accomplished.

20:33.233 --> 20:34.234
Mission accomplished?

20:35.193 --> 20:36.569
The mission hasn't even started yet.

20:36.695 --> 20:40.365
Well, I thought I had it in me
to rally one more time, but, um...

20:41.199 --> 20:42.367
I think it's enough.

20:43.243 --> 20:45.704
Hmm? I'm ready to rest now.

20:48.957 --> 20:52.210
Are you saying
you wanna stay dead, Rita?

20:53.044 --> 20:54.212
(Cliff) B... But...

20:54.546 --> 20:56.965
Mojo! Beating up fish guys and...

20:57.757 --> 20:58.925
Satan's ass crack.

20:59.009 --> 21:03.263
We didn't always
bring out the best in one another, did we?

21:03.555 --> 21:04.889
-(sniffs)
-(Rita) Having each other

21:04.973 --> 21:07.767
meant we never had to
spread our own wings.

21:08.601 --> 21:11.646
I'm doing this to set us all free.

21:12.355 --> 21:13.773
(Cliff) That's easy for you to say.

21:13.898 --> 21:16.192
You get all the sex ghost sex
you want now.

21:16.568 --> 21:17.610
What about the Doom Patrol?

21:19.654 --> 21:22.407
I don't think
this was ever meant to be our final stop.

21:23.533 --> 21:26.619
We're all on our own
extraordinary journeys

21:26.703 --> 21:28.455
and we all have so far to go.

21:28.580 --> 21:30.081
(sighs)

21:30.165 --> 21:32.584
If we stop here,

21:33.084 --> 21:35.503
we'll just keep falling
into the same cycle,

21:35.587 --> 21:38.131
making the same bad decisions

21:38.214 --> 21:41.051
and feeling the same pain.

21:41.509 --> 21:43.219
-We're screw ups.
-(chuckles)

21:43.303 --> 21:45.263
(Rita) But this doesn't
make us bad people.

21:45.513 --> 21:47.557
Just means that we need to work
on ourselves

21:47.640 --> 21:50.977
before we can really help others.

21:51.603 --> 21:55.774
We have spent so much time
trying to save the Doom Patrol.

21:56.232 --> 21:57.942
We're destroying ourselves.

21:58.860 --> 22:01.863
Moving on is one of the
scariest things in the world,

22:02.238 --> 22:04.783
but we have squared up against

22:05.658 --> 22:09.662
the most treacherous villains
in the known universe.

22:09.871 --> 22:11.539
(whispering) Is she
talking about the testicle monster?

22:11.831 --> 22:13.208
(whispering)
Maybe the roller skating dude.

22:13.291 --> 22:15.710
(Rita) We have all grown
more than capable

22:16.086 --> 22:18.004
of facing our own demons.

22:18.088 --> 22:20.256
(Cliff) Oh, come on!
Now we're breaking up?

22:20.548 --> 22:21.758
This is fucked, Rita.

22:22.092 --> 22:24.052
(Larry) Deep down, we all know it's true.

22:25.261 --> 22:26.805
Every crisis we solved,

22:27.847 --> 22:29.474
we created in the first place.

22:30.266 --> 22:31.184
Rita's right.

22:31.351 --> 22:33.103
Until we're better as individuals,

22:33.186 --> 22:34.729
we'll continue to cause harm.

22:35.188 --> 22:36.022
To the world,

22:36.314 --> 22:38.650
-each other.
-Wha... Okay, so...

22:39.859 --> 22:40.944
We just give up?

22:43.613 --> 22:45.407
You're supposed to be our leader.

22:45.490 --> 22:46.324
Yes.

22:46.783 --> 22:47.701
I am.

22:48.576 --> 22:50.120
And as team leader...

22:51.705 --> 22:52.747
I'm calling it.

22:54.708 --> 22:56.376
It's time to disband.

22:57.252 --> 22:59.087
The Doom Patrol is no longer.

23:00.463 --> 23:03.758
But first, we have one last assignment.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.803
Finally! Fuck, yeah! Let's go!

23:06.886 --> 23:07.846
(Rita) I would like you

23:08.263 --> 23:09.347
to burn my body.

23:12.308 --> 23:13.226
(Cliff) No! Nope!

23:13.560 --> 23:14.436
I refuse.

23:14.519 --> 23:16.688
I didn't burn that fuck Niles' body,

23:16.771 --> 23:19.482
and I won't burn yours.
Except you're not a fuck.

23:23.153 --> 23:24.946
If this is what you really want, Rita...

23:26.740 --> 23:27.907
then you have my support.

23:39.252 --> 23:40.253
(Cliff) Hang on.

23:40.378 --> 23:41.713
Wait! Wait!

23:44.382 --> 23:45.216
Fuck.

23:46.051 --> 23:47.260
(crickets chirping)

24:00.148 --> 24:02.567
Because she was always
so worried about her looks.

24:07.489 --> 24:08.823
(Rita) Uh-huh.

24:09.449 --> 24:10.575
Well, that's just...

24:12.577 --> 24:13.495
Sweet.

24:21.920 --> 24:23.088
Because she loved bees.

24:24.673 --> 24:25.590
I think.

24:26.549 --> 24:29.427
Okay. Yeah, sure. (scoffs)

24:34.015 --> 24:35.392
A martini.

24:35.475 --> 24:36.935
(Madame Rouge)
Dry with a pinch of salt.

24:37.018 --> 24:39.104
Her favorite thing in the whole world.

24:39.187 --> 24:40.021
(Larry) Oh, good choice.

24:40.105 --> 24:41.940
It wasn't my favorite thing.

24:42.023 --> 24:43.358
-Oh, so I can take it...
-(glass clinks)

24:43.441 --> 24:44.901
(gasps) Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

24:44.984 --> 24:48.321
Okay. Well, let's just move on, shall we?

24:49.489 --> 24:51.825
I know you two took this seriously.

24:52.242 --> 24:53.159
What did you bring?

25:02.544 --> 25:03.378
(sighs in annoyance)

25:03.837 --> 25:07.048
Right. Okay. Let's just, um...

25:07.465 --> 25:09.843
Let's just get this over with, hmm?

25:16.099 --> 25:17.559
I can't believe
this is really happening.

25:22.731 --> 25:24.566
This isn't just the end for Rita.

25:26.109 --> 25:27.027
You know that, right?

25:29.237 --> 25:30.155
(Larry) We know.

25:34.826 --> 25:35.660
(sighs)

25:39.247 --> 25:40.081
(clicks)

25:51.676 --> 25:55.722
My! I didn't realize I was so flammable.

25:56.139 --> 25:57.307
Probably all the alcohol.

25:59.142 --> 26:04.272
(singing) Ave Maria

26:10.111 --> 26:15.408
Gratia plena

26:17.077 --> 26:17.911
Maria...

26:17.994 --> 26:20.872
(sobbing loudly)
It's just so fucking beautiful.

26:20.955 --> 26:22.874
...gratia plena

26:22.957 --> 26:25.335
-(body squirting)
-(Cliff sobbing)

26:26.878 --> 26:28.421
This is so embarrassing.

26:29.089 --> 26:31.508
(Larry) It's okay.
Death isn't supposed to be pretty.

26:31.591 --> 26:32.425
(Jane continues singing)

26:32.634 --> 26:34.135
(squishing)

26:41.518 --> 26:44.479
Oh, my God.
Can somebody do something?

26:51.069 --> 26:52.362
-(pops)
-(farting)

26:52.487 --> 26:53.321
(gasps) Oh.

26:54.614 --> 26:55.448
Ugh.

26:56.408 --> 26:57.909
(coughing)

26:59.828 --> 27:00.662
(groans)

27:01.204 --> 27:02.122
(all coughing)

27:02.205 --> 27:05.166
Just smells like burning...
(coughs) rubber.

27:05.250 --> 27:08.420
I don't need you to describe
my burning corpse's scent.

27:08.503 --> 27:09.421
Thank you very much.

27:09.546 --> 27:10.505
(gasps) Sorry.

27:11.297 --> 27:13.258
It's fine.

27:22.475 --> 27:24.644
It's totally fine.

27:24.811 --> 27:26.312
(melancholy music playing)

27:48.585 --> 27:49.711
(opening film music playing)

27:58.011 --> 27:59.054
I made enough for everybody.

27:59.387 --> 28:00.680
(film announcer on TV)
Secret Rendezvous.

28:02.057 --> 28:03.183
Starring...

28:03.266 --> 28:04.267
S'mores?

28:05.727 --> 28:07.062
There's something wrong with you, dude.

28:07.145 --> 28:07.979
(film announcer on TV) Carl...

28:08.063 --> 28:09.689
What? I had a craving.

28:09.773 --> 28:13.193
(film announcer on TV)
And introducing Rita Farr.

28:14.444 --> 28:16.363
In this stately Boston mansion,

28:16.446 --> 28:18.782
the wedding of the year
is about to commence.

28:19.282 --> 28:20.867
(closing film music playing)

28:26.289 --> 28:29.959
(Cliff) I can't believe
Oliver went out like that.

28:30.126 --> 28:31.044
What a tool.

28:34.506 --> 28:36.383
Polly deserved so much better.

28:37.967 --> 28:39.010
So, what do we do now?

28:40.220 --> 28:41.137
Call it a night?

28:43.264 --> 28:45.183
(Larry) Anybody wanna
watch it again?

28:45.517 --> 28:46.851
-(gasps)
-(Cliff) Yeah.

28:47.143 --> 28:47.977
What?

28:48.728 --> 28:50.814
Smashing idea, Larry. Yes.

28:56.569 --> 28:57.612
(opening film music playing)

29:30.437 --> 29:31.354
(Jane) Seriously?

29:33.314 --> 29:35.191
You're just gonna leave
without saying goodbye.

29:35.400 --> 29:38.737
Ah. I didn't wanna steal Rita's spotlight.

29:39.487 --> 29:41.281
Besides, this isn't goodbye.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.575
It's just a new chapter.

29:50.123 --> 29:51.041
Are you okay?

29:51.166 --> 29:52.834
(grunts) Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, it's nothing.

29:52.917 --> 29:54.961
I'm 35 again, remember?
(chuckles nervously)

29:55.378 --> 29:57.547
God, I can't wait to see
the look on Rory's face.

29:57.630 --> 29:58.923
I hope he hasn't forgotten me.

30:00.050 --> 30:00.925
How could he?

30:01.092 --> 30:02.969
You're like the best grandpa ever.

30:03.553 --> 30:04.929
And a ginormous robot.

30:05.180 --> 30:06.723
Ha! Fucking A.

30:08.099 --> 30:08.933
(sighs)

30:09.142 --> 30:10.685
Well, what about you?

30:10.852 --> 30:11.936
What are you gonna do now?

30:13.229 --> 30:16.524
I don't know. Um...
Maybe get a sublet. Paint?

30:17.859 --> 30:19.611
(Cliff) That is so fucking lame.

30:19.944 --> 30:21.154
I'm serious.

30:21.237 --> 30:23.156
-You're, like, unstoppable now.
-(chuckles)

30:23.239 --> 30:24.616
You could be a superhero

30:24.699 --> 30:25.742
-or some shit.
-All right.

30:25.825 --> 30:28.787
Take over the Justice League.
Pants Superman.

30:29.162 --> 30:31.122
(clicks tongue) I don't think
that's what we want.

30:31.664 --> 30:34.084
As... As lame as it sounds,

30:34.250 --> 30:37.962
a sublet and painting
feels like the right move, for now.

30:38.338 --> 30:40.298
And who knows?
Maybe something else will come along

30:40.382 --> 30:42.258
that will feel even righter.

30:42.967 --> 30:44.177
Whatever I do,

30:45.553 --> 30:47.055
it's not just up to me anymore.

30:47.847 --> 30:48.932
It's up to all of us.

30:52.519 --> 30:54.145
(Cliff) Weird, getting to choose, huh?

30:55.939 --> 30:59.526
No mission,
no life or death ultimatum.

31:00.527 --> 31:02.696
It's almost like we get
to be regular people again.

31:03.029 --> 31:03.863
(chuckles softly)

31:05.365 --> 31:06.408
You think we can?

31:09.869 --> 31:11.121
I guess it's worth a shot.

31:11.913 --> 31:14.290
We may all be fractured,

31:15.000 --> 31:16.668
but doesn't mean we can't be whole.

31:24.676 --> 31:25.593
You're a whole.

31:34.060 --> 31:34.894
(car engine revving)

31:52.537 --> 31:53.371
(chuckles)

31:56.374 --> 31:58.001
Fuck you too, tin man.

32:03.423 --> 32:06.926
Can't remember when we last

32:09.971 --> 32:14.809
Took the time to see a sunset

32:14.976 --> 32:15.810
(sighs)

32:19.689 --> 32:20.940
What now, little guy?

32:24.110 --> 32:25.653
I guess we can do whatever we want.

32:26.321 --> 32:27.322
We have time now.

32:32.327 --> 32:33.370
I know, buddy.

32:34.037 --> 32:34.954
I know.

32:36.748 --> 32:37.874
I wanna see him, too.

32:39.125 --> 32:40.502
But 104 is gone.

32:44.631 --> 32:45.465
(sighs)

32:47.342 --> 32:50.720
As the waves come and go

32:53.598 --> 32:57.644
Fads vanish while underneath the snow

33:01.523 --> 33:05.360
Lies the grass ready to grow

33:07.278 --> 33:10.740
After all is said and done

33:11.366 --> 33:15.078
After all is said and done

33:19.416 --> 33:20.250
(mouse chittering)

33:22.293 --> 33:25.380
After all is said and done

33:52.032 --> 33:55.410
After all is said and done

33:57.579 --> 34:00.957
(Madame Rouge) You know,
when we went into that future

34:01.041 --> 34:03.710
and I saw I wasn't there...

34:05.545 --> 34:09.174
I can't say it really surprised me much.

34:10.592 --> 34:12.260
That's the story of my life.

34:12.886 --> 34:14.929
I come, I do damage,

34:15.722 --> 34:16.556
and I run.

34:18.391 --> 34:19.434
That's what I do.

34:30.110 --> 34:32.237
You might get lonely
in this big old place by yourself.

34:32.739 --> 34:33.572
Yeah.

34:34.282 --> 34:36.826
Well, there's always the sex ghosts.

34:37.869 --> 34:38.828
Can I tell you a secret?

34:42.331 --> 34:43.750
(sighs) Yeah.

34:46.293 --> 34:47.587
When I was in the time stream,

34:49.214 --> 34:50.465
I saw my future.

34:51.841 --> 34:52.676
My new future.

34:55.303 --> 34:56.388
What was it like?

34:58.431 --> 34:59.307
Perfect.

34:59.933 --> 35:03.061
(chuckles) Everything
I could've ever wanted. More.

35:04.145 --> 35:05.980
I know that it's gonna be
an uphill journey.

35:07.023 --> 35:09.150
But for the first time in my life,

35:10.193 --> 35:12.737
I feel like I'm finally
on the path that I carved for myself.

35:15.156 --> 35:15.990
(softly) Wow.

35:16.074 --> 35:16.908
(clicks tongue)

35:17.909 --> 35:18.743
I'm...

35:19.869 --> 35:21.287
positively envious.

35:22.330 --> 35:23.248
But you know what?

35:24.332 --> 35:26.459
A drop more vodka will fix that.

35:27.502 --> 35:29.671
You could carve a path for yourself, too.

35:29.921 --> 35:32.549
Oh, yeah. 'Course.
'Course I could. You know what?

35:32.632 --> 35:34.300
-(bottle smacks table)
-(snaps fingers)

35:34.384 --> 35:36.720
I'm gonna get right onto that. (scoffs)

35:36.803 --> 35:38.221
-(Vic) I'm serious.
-Mmm-hmm.

35:38.304 --> 35:39.139
(Vic) Just think.

35:39.472 --> 35:40.557
What feels right to you?

35:40.932 --> 35:41.766
(Madame Rouge sighs)

35:42.058 --> 35:45.061
What feels right or wrong
to someone like me?

35:45.353 --> 35:46.688
-Hmm.
-(Madame Rouge) I've, um...

35:50.608 --> 35:51.901
had a few thoughts.

35:52.652 --> 35:53.486
Since Rita.

35:53.945 --> 35:56.322
Some damningly altruistic,

35:56.781 --> 35:58.825
some not so much. (snorts)

36:02.078 --> 36:06.249
But, um, things that are
probably best left unshared with Cyborg.

36:08.001 --> 36:11.504
Do you think someone can be
both good and bad?

36:17.135 --> 36:19.095
I used to think that
there were no shades of gray.

36:19.596 --> 36:20.722
Only black and white.

36:21.014 --> 36:22.349
But, (chuckles)

36:22.432 --> 36:25.226
being here has done a lot
to change my perspective.

36:25.977 --> 36:28.063
I've learned that
the line between the two

36:28.730 --> 36:30.106
can be razor thin.

36:30.732 --> 36:32.025
Hard to spot sometimes.

36:32.859 --> 36:33.860
Even harder to toe.

36:34.652 --> 36:35.487
(whispers) But...

36:38.990 --> 36:41.076
How will I know where the line is?

36:49.376 --> 36:51.086
I'll let you know
when you've gone too far.

37:32.502 --> 37:34.004
(inhales deeply)

37:52.439 --> 37:53.356
(John) You want a chance?

37:53.732 --> 37:54.649
Take one.

37:56.776 --> 37:58.319
(sighs) Keeg.

38:00.030 --> 38:02.157
(sighs) Do you think you could find Rama?

38:04.117 --> 38:05.285
-(electricity buzzing)
-No, no, stop.

38:05.368 --> 38:06.453
Hang on, pal.

38:08.997 --> 38:09.831
(sighs)

38:10.498 --> 38:11.624
I meant together.

38:13.752 --> 38:14.586
(sighs)

38:16.796 --> 38:18.006
Let's go find him together.

38:21.551 --> 38:23.428
Five hundred square feet.

38:24.012 --> 38:25.680
Shared kitchen.

38:26.139 --> 38:28.433
Seriously? Neon green walls?

38:28.850 --> 38:29.726
Come on.

38:31.478 --> 38:33.938
Oh, hi. You wanna
watch a movie with me?

38:34.022 --> 38:35.190
(Larry) Sorry, I gotta go.

38:35.648 --> 38:36.566
(Jane) Go where?

38:37.484 --> 38:38.693
I don't know. (laughs)

38:38.777 --> 38:40.779
(Jane) Doesn't sound like you,
but okay.

38:40.862 --> 38:42.280
-(Larry laughs)
-(door closes)

38:42.822 --> 38:44.741
-Ugh.
-(alarm blaring)

38:45.116 --> 38:46.159
Shit fuck.

38:46.368 --> 38:47.452
(keyboard clacking)

38:47.619 --> 38:48.453
(alarm continues blaring)

38:48.787 --> 38:50.413
No one's here!

38:50.497 --> 38:52.248
The Doom Patrol's over!

38:53.458 --> 38:54.292
(clicks tongue)

39:03.176 --> 39:04.010
(alarm stops)

39:04.302 --> 39:06.137
Sorry. I think that was me.

39:08.223 --> 39:09.057
Casey.

39:11.184 --> 39:12.686
I didn't scare you, did I?

39:13.395 --> 39:14.312
Um...

39:16.481 --> 39:19.401
Sorry, it's just that
Dorothy said the manor would be empty...

39:20.235 --> 39:23.863
and there was a spaceship here
that no one else was using, so...

39:24.030 --> 39:24.864
Where are you taking it?

39:25.240 --> 39:26.741
(Casey) Um, I don't know yet.

39:27.492 --> 39:30.036
Space just felt like
a good place to start.

39:31.538 --> 39:32.455
What about you?

39:33.331 --> 39:36.793
What are you going to do now
that the Doom Patrol is done?

39:38.503 --> 39:40.463
I think I'll find a sublet.

39:42.215 --> 39:43.425
Spend my days painting.

39:43.842 --> 39:44.676
Hmm.

39:45.927 --> 39:46.970
(softly) That sounds nice.

39:48.263 --> 39:49.097
Yeah.

39:50.223 --> 39:51.933
-(Casey) Peaceful.
-Thanks.

39:56.980 --> 39:59.774
Actually, to be completely honest...

40:01.735 --> 40:05.280
when Dorothy said
that the manor would be empty...

40:08.366 --> 40:09.993
I was kind of hoping
that she was wrong.

40:14.289 --> 40:15.540
I just wanted you to know.

40:17.834 --> 40:18.668
(sighs)

40:24.758 --> 40:26.176
So how long are you going for?

40:27.594 --> 40:28.470
(Casey) Oh, uh...

40:29.637 --> 40:32.766
A week, a month.

40:33.892 --> 40:35.101
Maybe three.

40:35.268 --> 40:36.895
-I'm not sure yet.
-What is that?

40:37.562 --> 40:40.315
Like 500 square feet?
(chuckles nervously)

40:40.648 --> 40:42.859
Uh... Yeah, I think so.

40:43.318 --> 40:44.152
Hmm.

40:45.070 --> 40:46.154
Modern appliances,

40:46.529 --> 40:47.655
large windows,

40:47.947 --> 40:49.240
lots of natural light,

40:49.991 --> 40:51.159
hell of a view.

40:53.370 --> 40:54.454
What do you say, Captain?

40:56.456 --> 40:57.540
You got room for one more?

41:00.377 --> 41:01.544
(both chuckle)

41:04.339 --> 41:06.257
(party horn blowing)

41:07.842 --> 41:08.677
(Clara chuckles)

41:10.387 --> 41:11.471
Blow out the candles.

41:11.680 --> 41:13.139
-(Cliff) Go on, go, go.
-Can you blow the candles?

41:13.223 --> 41:14.057
-(Cliff blowing)
-Come on.

41:14.140 --> 41:15.266
(Cliff) Go on.
I can... I got it.

41:15.350 --> 41:16.601
No, wait, you do it. (chuckles)

41:16.810 --> 41:17.644
(all blowing)

41:17.727 --> 41:19.646
-Yay, good job!
-Yay! (clapping)

41:20.313 --> 41:21.314
-(gurgling)
-(all laughing)

41:21.481 --> 41:22.315
Yay! (laughing)

41:22.649 --> 41:23.942
Yeah! Good job!

41:25.819 --> 41:26.986
Here you go, little bud.

41:28.279 --> 41:29.489
-(crunches)
-Ow!

41:29.906 --> 41:30.949
-Are you okay?
-(gasps)

41:31.032 --> 41:32.158
(laughs)

41:32.534 --> 41:33.702
I'm fantastic!

41:34.411 --> 41:37.080
You got some chompers on you, kid.
Yes, you do.

41:37.497 --> 41:38.498
Yes, you do.

41:39.165 --> 41:40.083
I got an idea.

41:40.500 --> 41:42.711
You wanna come see what
your Grandpa Cliff got you?

41:46.464 --> 41:48.800
Um, she... She still needs a little love.

41:49.384 --> 41:51.594
But we'll get her fixed up together.

41:53.346 --> 41:57.058
Starting with this little doodad here.

41:58.268 --> 42:00.937
You know, your mama Clara's
not too bad around an engine.

42:01.688 --> 42:03.982
She'll be able to show you
a thing or two as well.

42:04.065 --> 42:06.443
-(whirring and creaking)
-Oh, shit.

42:06.735 --> 42:07.569
(Clara) Dad?

42:07.861 --> 42:08.695
I'm fine.

42:09.029 --> 42:09.946
I'm fine.

42:10.155 --> 42:10.989
(Clara huffs)

42:12.490 --> 42:14.784
-No, you're not.
-I'm fine. I'm fine. Just...

42:15.035 --> 42:15.952
Just give me a second.

42:16.036 --> 42:17.829
-(crying)
-(Clara) Dad, what's going on?

42:17.912 --> 42:18.997
Are you freezing up again?

42:19.080 --> 42:20.165
-(Rory crying)
-Come here, baby.

42:20.248 --> 42:22.542
(Cliff grunting)

42:26.004 --> 42:26.838
Dad.

42:29.674 --> 42:30.675
(Cliff) I'm sorry, Clara.

42:32.510 --> 42:34.554
I thought I was coming home to live.

42:35.263 --> 42:36.097
But...

42:37.098 --> 42:38.975
I think I just came home to die.

42:40.060 --> 42:40.894
(whirring and creaking)

42:41.186 --> 42:42.020
("Love Chained" playing)

42:46.900 --> 42:47.734
(Rory crying)

42:50.528 --> 42:53.239
Tell me, baby

42:53.531 --> 42:57.535
Things will never change

42:57.952 --> 43:00.205
Yet I know the truth

43:00.288 --> 43:03.708
Honey, nothing stays the same

43:05.085 --> 43:06.002
(birds chirping)

43:06.086 --> 43:07.962
I can feel you

43:08.046 --> 43:08.880
(wings fluttering)

43:08.963 --> 43:12.759
Pulsing through my veins

43:12.967 --> 43:13.802
Hey.

43:14.427 --> 43:15.428
I know you.

43:16.763 --> 43:17.639
(man) It's good to see you...

43:19.224 --> 43:20.141
stranger.

43:20.308 --> 43:23.269
It's true

43:23.520 --> 43:26.981
You know how to

43:27.357 --> 43:30.819
Tell all your lies to me

43:31.236 --> 43:34.572
Make me believe it was me

43:35.031 --> 43:38.368
I'm stuck in the blue

43:38.952 --> 43:42.539
Down on my knees for you

43:42.664 --> 43:46.292
Send all your love to me

43:46.751 --> 43:50.296
I dream a dream for me

43:52.424 --> 43:54.843
Say that you want me

43:55.760 --> 43:58.513
But I know that you need me

43:59.055 --> 44:00.515
I can feel you

44:00.598 --> 44:02.308
I can hear you

44:02.434 --> 44:03.268
(whooshing)

44:03.351 --> 44:06.146
Calling out to me

44:07.981 --> 44:10.108
Say that you want me

44:11.234 --> 44:14.029
But I know that you need me

44:14.237 --> 44:15.822
I can feel you

44:15.905 --> 44:16.740
(whooshing)

44:16.823 --> 44:19.743
And it's only you I see

44:21.578 --> 44:24.831
Baby, it's true

44:24.914 --> 44:25.832
What's going on?

44:25.915 --> 44:27.876
You know how to

44:27.959 --> 44:28.793
(breathing heavily)

44:29.461 --> 44:30.795
Tell all your lies...

44:30.879 --> 44:32.380
(Larry) It's okay, it's okay.

44:33.798 --> 44:35.175
Everything's gonna be okay.

44:35.717 --> 44:37.177
(gasps) But you need to be safe.

44:38.011 --> 44:38.845
I will be.

44:40.013 --> 44:40.889
Keeg's got us.

44:44.976 --> 44:46.102
We're gonna be fine.

44:46.895 --> 44:48.146
And the world will be, too.

44:51.232 --> 44:52.150
Thank you.

44:52.484 --> 44:55.987
I dream a dream for me

44:57.197 --> 44:59.741
It's true

45:00.283 --> 45:03.745
Baby, it's true

45:04.287 --> 45:07.499
Baby, it's true

45:08.041 --> 45:11.378
Baby, it's true

45:11.836 --> 45:15.465
Send all your love to me

45:15.715 --> 45:17.509
I dream a dream...

45:17.592 --> 45:18.426
Now,

45:18.802 --> 45:21.721
I know you all might recognize
this young man standing next to me.

45:22.597 --> 45:23.640
Victor Stone.

45:24.182 --> 45:25.767
Or as you might know him...

45:27.143 --> 45:28.353
Cyborg.

45:29.312 --> 45:30.146
2.0.

45:31.314 --> 45:32.315
(both chuckling softly)

45:32.857 --> 45:34.150
He's here to help me run this class,

45:34.234 --> 45:36.903
so I'd like you all
to think of him as my second in command.

45:38.363 --> 45:39.572
Kind of like my sidekick.

45:42.325 --> 45:43.410
Man, this is corny.

45:43.827 --> 45:44.911
What are you even doing here?

45:45.328 --> 45:46.788
Shouldn't you be kicking butt?

45:46.996 --> 45:48.331
-Saving the world?
-(sighs)

45:48.915 --> 45:49.749
Trust me.

45:51.126 --> 45:52.961
What you do here
is gonna save more lives

45:53.044 --> 45:54.879
than I ever will
out on the streets on my own.

45:56.297 --> 45:58.591
So I'm gonna need all of you
to listen extra hard.

45:59.426 --> 46:00.760
'Cause we're all in this together.

46:01.761 --> 46:02.804
And everything

46:03.430 --> 46:05.140
that we do here in this classroom...

46:06.433 --> 46:07.642
is gonna make a difference.

46:07.809 --> 46:09.060
(soft atmospheric music playing)

46:27.454 --> 46:28.538
-(kitten meows)
-(gasps)

46:28.705 --> 46:29.539
(chuckling)

46:30.206 --> 46:31.416
(Jane laughs)

46:34.169 --> 46:35.170
-(kisses)
-(gasps)

46:37.839 --> 46:38.840
(music slowly builds intensity)

47:11.039 --> 47:11.873
(elevator dings)

47:31.059 --> 47:31.893
(clicks)

47:33.228 --> 47:34.062
(whooshing)

47:34.896 --> 47:36.022
(men screaming)

47:47.575 --> 47:48.993
(wrench twisting)

47:51.121 --> 47:51.955
(faint music playing on radio)

47:53.373 --> 47:54.541
(metal tapping)

47:55.000 --> 47:55.959
All right, there we go.

47:56.126 --> 47:58.169
I'm ready for the PCV valve, Dad.

47:58.503 --> 47:59.462
(Cliff) Um...

48:00.046 --> 48:00.880
Uh...

48:01.881 --> 48:02.716
Uh...

48:03.133 --> 48:04.217
(laughs)

48:04.509 --> 48:06.469
Isn't that the cutest thing?

48:06.720 --> 48:07.554
(Rory gurgles)

48:07.721 --> 48:10.306
Ooh, but probably not the best thing
for you to be chewing on.

48:10.432 --> 48:11.808
-So...
-(whirrs and jams)

48:11.891 --> 48:12.892
(softly) Argh!

48:13.226 --> 48:14.310
Argh! (inhales sharply)

48:14.644 --> 48:16.021
(groaning)

48:16.271 --> 48:18.064
(grunting)

48:18.440 --> 48:19.482
(sighs in exasperation) Oh, fuck.

48:20.358 --> 48:21.192
(Rory coos)

48:21.985 --> 48:22.819
Hmm?

48:22.902 --> 48:23.737
(baby vocalizing)

48:23.862 --> 48:25.739
-What the...
-(child humming)

48:27.032 --> 48:28.241
Holy shit.

48:28.867 --> 48:30.994
Is that what Immortus was talking about?

48:31.119 --> 48:32.162
(Clara) What did you say, Dad?

48:33.038 --> 48:35.123
Nothing. I... I...

48:35.206 --> 48:36.041
(child vocalizing)

48:36.124 --> 48:36.958
Uh...

48:37.167 --> 48:38.376
("Breathe In" playing)

48:38.752 --> 48:40.128
-(child singing)
-(man speaking indistinctly)

48:41.171 --> 48:42.005
(whooshing)

48:44.716 --> 48:47.177
Right of way.
Right of way, right of way!

48:47.260 --> 48:48.178
Jesus!

48:48.261 --> 48:49.095
Rory!

48:49.888 --> 48:51.681
-I love you.
-I love you, too. (chuckles)

48:51.765 --> 48:53.391
(gasps) Oh, my God, Mom!

48:53.558 --> 48:54.392
Stop.

48:56.728 --> 48:57.562
(Rory) Stop.

49:02.442 --> 49:03.943
I've seen the light

49:04.027 --> 49:04.861
(chuckling nervously)

49:05.070 --> 49:06.196
Holy shit!

49:07.197 --> 49:08.698
(chuckles nervously)
I'm gonna be a dad.

49:08.823 --> 49:09.657
(breathing heavily)

49:10.116 --> 49:11.868
Ahhh! Ahhh!

49:14.162 --> 49:16.915
I've felt alive

49:17.374 --> 49:18.208
(engine revving)

49:18.500 --> 49:19.334
(tires screeching)

49:20.293 --> 49:21.920
I've seen the last day go

49:22.087 --> 49:24.172
(woman screaming)
You're a piece of shit, Rory Steele!

49:25.507 --> 49:27.258
(Clara) Dad! Are you okay?

49:33.473 --> 49:34.599
I'm scared, Rory.

49:36.518 --> 49:39.270
I've seen the sun

49:40.772 --> 49:42.440
I won't let anything
happen to you, Mom.

49:42.524 --> 49:47.946
I've felt the night grow cold

49:48.113 --> 49:51.282
I've sold a lie

49:51.366 --> 49:53.034
(sobbing uncontrollably)

49:53.660 --> 49:58.623
'I've bled for truth, I've told

49:59.082 --> 50:00.709
This is what it is

50:01.084 --> 50:02.252
(Cliff) Hi, baby Clara.

50:03.420 --> 50:04.337
I'm your dad.

50:04.629 --> 50:07.173
This is who we are

50:07.382 --> 50:09.050
(RJ) The road is long
and twisty, son.

50:10.135 --> 50:11.177
And in the end,

50:11.261 --> 50:13.304
wherever you are
or whoever you're with,

50:13.847 --> 50:16.266
all's you got is your self-respect.
You understand me?

50:17.642 --> 50:19.102
(Cliff) I know where I will be.

50:19.185 --> 50:20.437
I'll be right here.

50:23.857 --> 50:24.691
(car door opens)

50:25.859 --> 50:27.110
-(woman breathing nervously)
-(baby cooing)

50:32.866 --> 50:33.825
Jordy.

50:34.909 --> 50:36.161
This is Rory.

50:36.578 --> 50:37.412
(Rory gasps)

50:37.579 --> 50:38.663
He's your grandpa.

50:39.748 --> 50:40.665
(baby cooing)

50:49.591 --> 50:50.508
(Clara) Dad.

50:51.885 --> 50:52.719
(Cliff) It's okay.

50:55.096 --> 50:57.223
-It's okay.
-(Rory gurgles)

50:58.975 --> 51:00.226
I made it home.

51:01.478 --> 51:03.855
(machinery powering down)

51:03.980 --> 51:09.152
This is what it is

51:09.611 --> 51:13.198
This is who we are

51:15.200 --> 51:20.455
Don't know what you'll miss

51:20.789 --> 51:24.209
Till you've gone too far

51:25.085 --> 51:28.129
Breathe in

51:30.715 --> 51:32.967
Breathe out
