00:04.629 --> 00:07.632
FERRIS (on speaker):
Don’t underestimate Bryan.

00:07.674 --> 00:10.301
He must be valuable.

00:10.343 --> 00:12.012
But he’s had his own troubles.

00:12.053 --> 00:15.515
Maddox pulled him out of an
M.P. prison in Afghanistan.

00:15.557 --> 00:17.976
When I was in Surobi,
I destroyed families.

00:18.018 --> 00:22.439
-BRYAN: Garcia.
-GARCIA: You’re still
taking the injections.

00:22.480 --> 00:24.357
BRYAN:
When they send them to me.

00:24.399 --> 00:25.525
GEORGE:
I need to build
a device to track

00:25.567 --> 00:28.361
a very dangerous piece
of Debris.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.613
I need Zarkari’s files.

00:30.655 --> 00:32.949
FINOLA:
I know what grief can do
to a person...

00:32.991 --> 00:35.869
how it makes you feel alone.

00:35.910 --> 00:38.872
BRYAN:
I know from experience.

00:38.913 --> 00:40.373
Everyone’s got a past, Bryan.

00:40.415 --> 00:42.292
I can’t help but wonder

00:42.334 --> 00:45.211
who was in the picture
you were looking at.

00:45.253 --> 00:47.672
-FINOLA: Hey!
-BRYAN: Another time.

00:49.883 --> 00:51.593
(device scanning)

01:02.062 --> 01:03.772
Are you reading this?

01:03.813 --> 01:05.231
Close to maxed.

01:05.273 --> 01:08.109
It’s not just me.

01:08.151 --> 01:10.236
Never seen a signal
like this.

01:12.238 --> 01:14.032
It’s peaking.

01:14.074 --> 01:15.200
No one get closer.

01:15.241 --> 01:16.910
We can go in with Vector Twos.

01:16.951 --> 01:18.870
We don’t know
that will be safe, either.

01:18.912 --> 01:20.955
Just bring me one.

01:20.997 --> 01:23.625
You’d prefer a civilian
find this piece?
We don’t have a choice.

01:27.921 --> 01:30.632
If I’m not back in ten minutes,
quarantine the area.

01:33.009 --> 01:34.928
(device scanning)

01:34.969 --> 01:36.930
MAN: This is Hazmat Team Four.

01:36.971 --> 01:39.849
We’re onsite and seeing Laghari
readings in excess of 700.

01:51.903 --> 01:54.155
(device scanning intensifies)

02:02.831 --> 02:04.916
(device scanning)

02:04.958 --> 02:06.960
What are you doing here?

02:07.002 --> 02:08.837
(device scanning intensifies)

02:16.386 --> 02:19.305
Bryan Beneventi.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.602
Bryan Beneventi.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.734
* (theme)

02:59.220 --> 03:03.266
FINOLA: Oh, my God!
It’s everywhere! Everywhere!

03:03.308 --> 03:08.271
I spy with my little eye
somebody who’s, like, very--

03:08.313 --> 03:09.939
-very grumpy.
-Yeah.

03:09.981 --> 03:11.691
I just don’t understand.
Just help me understand

03:11.733 --> 03:13.526
why you’re even balancing it
on a dashboard.

03:13.568 --> 03:15.862
It’s a pothole.
Potholes are unforeseeable.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.864
-It’s why they
call them potholes.
-I foresee them. I foresee them.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.700
Now here I am.
I’m gonna smell like mint chip.

03:20.742 --> 03:23.370
-Macchiato. Sorry.
-Macchiato? What? I--

03:25.747 --> 03:28.291
I’m sorry, okay?
Please accept my apology.

03:28.333 --> 03:31.002
-I’m trying.
-You looking for
another coffee shop?

03:31.044 --> 03:32.587
-Yeah.
-If you are,

03:32.629 --> 03:34.798
I’d like a caramel Frappuccino.

03:34.839 --> 03:37.676
I’m calling Garcia
to find out about my dad,

03:37.717 --> 03:40.261
and you really need
to quit with the sugar.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.555
-Pump three, please.
-(phone ringing)

03:42.597 --> 03:45.934
And, uh, would you happen
to sell aluminium foil?

03:45.975 --> 03:48.478
-Aluminum foil?
-Yes.

03:48.520 --> 03:50.939
-No, we don’t. Sorry.
-(ringing continues)

03:52.774 --> 03:55.527
-I think that’s you.
-Oh! Oh!

03:55.568 --> 03:57.153
-Oh! Thank you.
-Yeah.

03:57.195 --> 03:59.531
-GEORGE: Yes.
-Dad?

03:59.572 --> 04:01.074
Hello, sweetheart.
How are you?

04:01.116 --> 04:02.992
Yeah, fine.
We’re headed back to you.

04:03.034 --> 04:05.286
Why are you answering
Garcia’s phone?

04:05.328 --> 04:08.289
Garcia lent me his van
and his phone.

04:08.331 --> 04:10.250
I’m at a petrol station--

04:10.291 --> 04:12.419
Why are you at a petrol station?

04:12.460 --> 04:15.046
I’m on my way to the--
the antennas.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.506
Antennas?

04:16.548 --> 04:19.592
Yes. The antenna fields
in Virginia.

04:19.634 --> 04:24.097
So you’re telling me that you
were driving all the way from
Oregon to Virginia alone?

04:24.139 --> 04:28.393
I’ll be fine. I need a way to--
to boost the scanner signal

04:28.435 --> 04:29.853
once I’m done.

04:29.894 --> 04:31.062
You’re asking
a lot of questions.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.522
And I can’t concentrate.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.441
I’ve got a lot on my plate.

04:34.482 --> 04:37.736
Please don’t worry.
I’m perfectly capable.

04:37.777 --> 04:38.945
Okay.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.613
Finola,

04:40.655 --> 04:43.116
you have to get
the Laghari files

04:43.158 --> 04:44.576
to me as soon as possible.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.453
Yep. I’m working on that.

04:46.494 --> 04:48.079
And I’m gonna speak
to Ferris, okay?

04:48.121 --> 04:50.165
Well, I’ll contact you
once I’m there.

04:50.206 --> 04:51.541
Okay.

04:52.792 --> 04:55.628
-(phone vibrates)
-FINOLA: Oh, my God.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.088
-Yeah.
-It’s Tom.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.966
You need to come to Cedarville,
Maryland, right away.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.301
Okay. Why?

05:01.343 --> 05:02.761
We found a woman out here

05:02.802 --> 05:04.554
affected by Debris,
and she asked for you.

05:04.596 --> 05:05.889
What do you mean?

05:05.930 --> 05:07.891
She’s asking for you by name.

05:07.932 --> 05:10.560
She just keeps saying
your name.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.159
Didn’t see an order
come through for this.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.660
I could have it ready for you.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.245
Come on,
you know how these things go.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.956
It was a last-minute thing.
I just gotta run some tests.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.376
It could help me with
a new piece we just found.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.710
Thanks, Kelso.

05:44.886 --> 05:47.389
-Check these readings.
-Uh-huh.

05:54.229 --> 05:56.815
-Tom.
-Around nine A.M.,

05:56.856 --> 05:59.442
satellite scan picked up
disturbances in the atmosphere--

05:59.484 --> 06:02.612
When the Situation Team arrived,
they found her here waiting
for them.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.197
You ever see her before?

06:04.239 --> 06:05.949
-No.
-Who is she?

06:05.990 --> 06:08.368
Mariel Caldwell,
a local high school teacher.

06:08.410 --> 06:12.497
Wildlife preserve camera
picked her up on a hiking
trail just south of here.

06:12.539 --> 06:13.957
But check this out.

06:13.998 --> 06:16.167
We don’t know where
that shimmer came from,

06:16.209 --> 06:19.004
but it disappeared
when it reached her.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.839
BRYAN:
Seems like it’s following her.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.718
We have a team searching
the area for Debris.

06:24.759 --> 06:27.554
-She didn’t say anything else?
-No.

06:27.595 --> 06:29.639
She just keeps repeating
your name.

06:31.057 --> 06:35.061
-Where is she now?
-Where we found her.

06:45.155 --> 06:46.448
BRYAN:
Hi.

06:48.450 --> 06:52.370
Your name is Mariel?
You’re asking for Bryan--

06:52.412 --> 06:54.664
Bryan Beneventi.

06:56.666 --> 06:59.002
I’m Bryan Beneventi.

07:01.629 --> 07:03.131
How do you know my name?

07:07.093 --> 07:11.973
You said my name.
How do you know me?

07:13.058 --> 07:14.934
(stammering)

07:14.976 --> 07:16.186
Surobi.

07:16.227 --> 07:19.731
The A01 Highway.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.193
Surobi?

07:23.234 --> 07:25.779
Are you talking about
Surobi, Afghanistan?

07:27.489 --> 07:29.616
It’s in my brown paper folder.

07:29.657 --> 07:33.703
It’s moon dust everywhere.

07:33.745 --> 07:35.830
Birds are coming in.

07:35.872 --> 07:39.167
What does that mean?
What is she talking about?

07:41.544 --> 07:43.672
Afghanistan.

07:43.713 --> 07:47.884
Movie night after Dee-Fack.
I hate movie night.

07:47.926 --> 07:51.680
Dust-- Dust-- Dust--
Dustoff... Inbound.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.766
FINOLA:
What’s going on?

07:54.808 --> 07:57.018
Do you understand
what she’s talking about?

07:57.060 --> 07:59.229
MARIEL:
Watch your flank, Frenchie.

07:59.270 --> 08:02.732
-Yes.
-MARIEL: I got your six.

08:02.774 --> 08:06.027
Somehow, this woman knows
things about my life.

08:11.199 --> 08:15.537
She’s reading at zero now.
Whatever happened is over.

08:18.373 --> 08:19.541
(sighs)

08:26.506 --> 08:27.716
(sighs)

08:29.801 --> 08:34.347
Mariel, how do you know me?

08:34.389 --> 08:36.725
Where did you hear my name?

08:36.766 --> 08:39.894
(whispering, indistinct)

08:39.936 --> 08:41.604
Let’s do a sweep
two kilometers to the west.

08:41.646 --> 08:43.106
It never ends around this place.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.733
How do you know parts
of my life?

08:44.774 --> 08:47.694
Jensen. Jensen!

08:49.904 --> 08:51.740
How are you doing that?

08:51.781 --> 08:55.869
I’m gonna miss you
when you’re gone...

08:55.910 --> 08:57.871
Bryan.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.124
What does that mean?

09:01.166 --> 09:03.793
I’m gonna miss you
when you’re gone.

09:05.253 --> 09:06.838
Bryan.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.215
That’s the last thing
that my mother said to me

09:09.257 --> 09:11.718
before I deployed
to Afghanistan.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.388
This woman is repeating
conversations from my life.

09:15.430 --> 09:17.891
Please verify there is no ACM
in that area, Frenchie.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.435
Beneventi, stand back.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.354
They’re firing even closer
to us right now.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.357
If you do that,
then we’ll get along very well.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.108
Very, very, very well.

09:27.150 --> 09:29.235
FINOLA:
Hey!

09:29.277 --> 09:31.321
(wind blowing)

09:41.623 --> 09:46.920
(Mariel whispering, indistinct)

09:50.465 --> 09:51.800
Everything okay?

09:53.927 --> 09:56.096
(wind intensifies)

09:58.098 --> 09:59.265
Yeah.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.769
Yeah, all good.

10:02.811 --> 10:05.021
-FINOLA: Bryan!
-We need help in here!

10:05.063 --> 10:07.816
Hey. Bryan.
Bryan, can you see me?

10:07.857 --> 10:11.069
WOMAN:
He’s not responding!
Get him to the scan room!

10:11.111 --> 10:13.196
-What did you do to him?
-(muttering)

10:13.238 --> 10:14.239
What did you do?

10:14.280 --> 10:15.949
Guess you got a new goal
to aspire to.

10:15.990 --> 10:17.867
Bryan! Listen to me!

10:17.909 --> 10:21.705
Can you hear me? Can you see me?
Look at me!

10:27.377 --> 10:29.004
Y’all done with
this water bottle?

10:29.045 --> 10:30.880
On Valentine’s Day,
that’s tough, Frenchie.

10:30.922 --> 10:32.465
LEBLANC:
Yeah, tell me about it.

10:32.507 --> 10:34.050
BRYAN:
We loaded, fellas?

10:34.092 --> 10:35.427
-Yep.
-Yeah, good to go, Benny.

10:35.468 --> 10:36.720
Hey, hey, hey, Frenchie, wait.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.556
-(laughter)
-Yo! Who in the hell?

10:39.597 --> 10:42.100
-Bro, that is definitely my bad.
-That was nasty, Jensen.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.019
I am definitely gonna
being paying

10:44.060 --> 10:45.854
your mother a visit for this
when I get home.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.230
She’s lonely,
she’s not that lonely.

10:47.272 --> 10:50.191
Benny, Colonel Kellogg
is en route for a visit.

10:50.233 --> 10:53.194
Advance plan op board has just
been posted.

10:53.236 --> 10:56.322
Command finally approves
an op, huh?

10:56.364 --> 10:58.283
Thank you, Sergeant.

10:58.324 --> 11:00.201
So Colonel’s coming in
to brief us up personally.

11:00.243 --> 11:02.370
Look at that.
We made the big leagues, boys.

11:02.412 --> 11:03.705
(chuckles)

11:03.747 --> 11:05.123
Thank God.

11:05.165 --> 11:07.917
It’s a little late here
to make a difference.

11:10.420 --> 11:12.422
-Fun times.
-Yeah.

11:28.772 --> 11:31.232
Oxygen 50,
pressure 210 over 100.

11:31.274 --> 11:33.943
-Pulse 120.
-Nystagmus.

11:33.985 --> 11:36.071
-Agonal breathing, diaphoretic.
-What is happening?

11:36.112 --> 11:38.406
He’s having an idiopathic
neurological event.

11:38.448 --> 11:40.408
We’re doing all we can.

11:40.450 --> 11:43.453
-(phone vibrating)
-Yeah. We’re still searching.

11:43.495 --> 11:46.581
FINOLA:
The Debris has to be somewhere
out there. It has to be.

11:46.623 --> 11:48.333
The shimmer came from somewhere.

11:48.375 --> 11:51.169
There’s some sort of connection
between them.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.921
We have to disable
the Debris in order

11:52.962 --> 11:54.422
to break its hold on Mariel

11:54.464 --> 11:56.007
and her link to Bryan.

11:56.049 --> 11:58.093
I understand that,
but we’re not getting
anything here.

11:58.134 --> 12:00.679
No signatures. And there’s
about a thousand acres
to cover.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.722
Okay. I’ve got some more agents
on the way to you now.

12:02.764 --> 12:04.307
Keep me posted.

12:13.983 --> 12:15.777
What have you got?

12:15.819 --> 12:18.321
Her heart rate
is matching Bryan’s.

12:18.363 --> 12:21.783
Blood pressure, oxygen levels,
all match.

12:21.825 --> 12:24.994
So these are the MGRS
coordinates.

12:25.036 --> 12:26.287
Four. Two. Sierra.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.415
MGRS...

12:28.456 --> 12:31.543
-That’s the Military Grid
Reference System.
-Yeah.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.544
Eight-five.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.173
MARIEL:
That’s not very far from here.

12:37.215 --> 12:40.010
FINOLA:
It’s Surobi again.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.097
Same old recon until
the colonel gets here.

12:44.139 --> 12:46.516
It’s your chance to show command
that you’re leadership material.

12:46.558 --> 12:48.476
Don’t forget us
when you’re at the top.

12:48.518 --> 12:50.311
Set up for me to fail.

12:50.353 --> 12:52.063
"Heightened threat of Taliban
attacks from the mountains."

12:52.105 --> 12:53.815
It’s always the case
in this country.

12:53.857 --> 12:55.567
Exactly.
So why even bother sending that?

12:55.608 --> 12:56.568
Semper Gumby.

12:59.195 --> 13:03.867
BRYAN: That boy over there?
I’ve never seen him before.
Who is he? Why is he here?

13:03.908 --> 13:07.328
I’ve seen him around.
His dad runs a new shop
by the entrance.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.914
-You didn’t read the flyer?
-He can’t read.

13:09.956 --> 13:12.000
-What, you think he’s a bomber?
-LEBLANC: He’s just a kid, man.

13:12.042 --> 13:13.585
I’ve learned the hard way.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.379
-Nelson, go check
it out, please.
-All right.

13:20.550 --> 13:24.179
Benny, we found that girl
that was injured on the last op.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.389
I’m taking her to get her hand
checked out.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.141
BRYAN:
Thanks.

13:37.859 --> 13:39.319
JENSEN:
Heightened threat, my ass.

13:39.361 --> 13:41.654
Taliban haven’t come
through here in weeks.

13:41.696 --> 13:43.907
That doesn’t mean anything.

13:43.948 --> 13:46.534
If command thinks there’s
an increased Taliban presence,
I trust it.

13:46.576 --> 13:50.455
You’re too trusting, Nelson.
They get it wrong, too.
Far too often.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.249
Yeah, well, I’d rather not be
the one who winds up dead.

13:53.291 --> 13:56.711
Just do your job.
They want more recon,
we’ll give them more recon.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.506
-(Asalah shouts
in native language)
-(rifles cock)

13:59.547 --> 14:01.424
(Asalah continues
in native language)

14:05.345 --> 14:08.098
-Stay alert.
-Copy that.

14:08.139 --> 14:11.142
WOMAN (on speaker):
Bravo Company, you are
cleared in Sector Nine.

14:11.184 --> 14:13.728
-You speak English?
-Yes.

14:13.770 --> 14:16.481
You’re the one who saved me.

14:19.150 --> 14:21.903
-What’s your name?
-Asalah.

14:21.945 --> 14:24.239
My name is Bryan.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.700
It’s too dangerous for you
to be out here alone.

14:28.493 --> 14:32.539
Bryan, my Baba...

14:32.580 --> 14:35.375
my grandfather...

14:35.417 --> 14:37.627
I don’t want him to be killed.

14:39.254 --> 14:41.006
I know you’re looking for
a bad man in the village,

14:41.047 --> 14:42.799
but he is not a bad man.

14:42.841 --> 14:44.592
He’s a good man.

14:44.634 --> 14:46.886
Where are your parents?

14:46.928 --> 14:49.681
I’ve been separated from them.

14:49.723 --> 14:51.433
And my brother.

14:51.474 --> 14:55.603
My Baba said they’re
not able to travel back,

14:55.645 --> 14:57.731
so he’s all I have left.

14:57.772 --> 15:00.692
Your grandfather is a good man.

15:00.734 --> 15:02.902
Right? Okay.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.779
He has nothing to worry about.

15:04.821 --> 15:08.199
We’re not here to hurt anybody.

15:08.241 --> 15:10.493
Does that make sense?

15:10.535 --> 15:13.121
Sometimes we stop outside
the base.

15:13.163 --> 15:17.834
I like the music
they play there.

15:17.876 --> 15:21.838
Music is ghazairoo.

15:21.880 --> 15:25.300
Ghazairoo?

15:25.342 --> 15:27.761
I don’t know what that means.

15:27.802 --> 15:31.639
Food for soul.

15:38.688 --> 15:43.276
Your grandfather’s
gonna be safe, Asalah.

15:43.318 --> 15:45.862
MAN (on radio):
This is Bravo Company
over in Sector Nine.

15:45.904 --> 15:49.449
Possible insurgents sighted.
Could use an extra patrol
over here.

15:49.491 --> 15:53.161
Hey, Miller wants to know
if we want to meet his unit
in Sector Nine.

15:53.203 --> 15:55.413
What’s he looking to hit
a home run today?

15:55.455 --> 15:58.333
Yeah, he really wants
to hit all the bases.

15:58.375 --> 16:01.127
Sometimes you just
gotta home run for it.

16:01.169 --> 16:03.672
It’s really messed up, Jensen.

16:03.713 --> 16:08.593
Well, I’m not gonna let Miller
get all that glory, Beneventi.

16:08.635 --> 16:10.762
Let’s roll.

16:19.437 --> 16:20.730
Where are we at?

16:20.772 --> 16:22.524
His condition’s
nowhere near stable.

16:22.565 --> 16:25.735
His heart rate’s dropping.
We tried everything to stop it.

16:25.777 --> 16:28.405
We have no idea
what she’s doing to him.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.249
How does she know
these things about him?

16:39.290 --> 16:40.959
Where does she get
this information?

16:41.001 --> 16:42.669
We’re still not sure.

16:42.711 --> 16:45.380
It’s been relatively quiet
in the region.

16:45.422 --> 16:47.132
What did the shimmer look like?

16:47.173 --> 16:50.635
Nothing. It was the usual
prismatic appearance,

16:50.677 --> 16:53.888
nothing different than
normal shine attributes.

16:53.930 --> 16:58.560
The first thing she mentioned
was a village in Afghanistan.

16:58.601 --> 17:02.188
Surobi.
Bryan knew what she meant.

17:02.230 --> 17:06.943
It’s as if she’s recounting,
um...

17:06.985 --> 17:09.738
an experience he had there.

17:09.779 --> 17:12.032
Why do you think that?

17:12.073 --> 17:16.494
She’s using
military terminology,
listing coordinates.

17:16.536 --> 17:19.456
It just sounds like she’s

17:19.497 --> 17:22.584
reciting conversations he’s had.

17:22.625 --> 17:27.047
Bryan, welcome
to Operation Desert Falcon.

17:27.088 --> 17:30.133
FINOLA:
Desert Falcon?

17:30.175 --> 17:31.885
Have you heard of that before?

17:31.926 --> 17:34.095
MARIEL:
...intel that
a high-value target

17:34.137 --> 17:36.556
has arrived in the region--
Al-Malik.

17:36.598 --> 17:39.392
Yeah. I recognize
what she’s saying.

17:39.434 --> 17:41.603
MARIEL:
One of the Taliban’s
top commanders in Nangarhar.

17:41.644 --> 17:45.523
We cannot allow him to expand
his hold in Surobi.

17:47.400 --> 17:49.944
This was your real mission.

17:49.986 --> 17:53.865
This was a very important
mission to Bryan...

17:53.907 --> 17:56.701
for many reasons.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.578
This is a jackpot target.

17:58.620 --> 18:00.830
Al-Malik’s fighters are hiding
among the locals.

18:00.872 --> 18:04.459
Your orders are to identify
any Taliban laying low here

18:04.501 --> 18:07.837
and to capture Al-Malik should
you come across him.

18:07.879 --> 18:10.423
This won’t be an easy task.

18:10.465 --> 18:13.843
But I know I am surrounded
by the most capable men

18:13.885 --> 18:15.011
in all of Afghanistan.

18:15.053 --> 18:17.263
Yeah. So they tell me.

18:17.305 --> 18:18.807
We’ll get it done, boys.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.850
-Right?
-(all affirm)

18:20.892 --> 18:24.270
"Won’t be an easy task?"
Understatement of the century.

18:24.312 --> 18:26.064
These guys are armed
to the teeth by the Iranians.

18:26.106 --> 18:29.275
Beneventi, a word.

18:29.317 --> 18:31.236
Relax, gentlemen.

18:34.948 --> 18:37.409
Congratulations on making
commanding officer.

18:37.450 --> 18:38.868
That’s badass.

18:38.910 --> 18:40.370
Thanks, Benny.

18:40.412 --> 18:42.080
Both come a long way
since that last tour.

18:42.122 --> 18:44.249
Yes, sir.

18:44.290 --> 18:47.794
So... what do you think
about this op?

18:49.713 --> 18:53.174
No joke.
We’re gonna pull it off.

18:53.216 --> 18:54.926
Great.

18:54.968 --> 18:58.847
I need there to be
a positive result out of this.

18:58.888 --> 19:00.640
Yeah. No fail missions.

19:10.692 --> 19:15.321
You’re looking a lot better
than the last time I saw you.

19:15.363 --> 19:17.115
You’re in good hands here.

19:17.157 --> 19:20.118
Keep me up to date?

19:20.160 --> 19:22.704
-This is him.
-Asalah, what
are you doing here?

19:22.746 --> 19:25.165
They’re taking my stitches out
soon.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.250
Sit down.

19:28.460 --> 19:30.837
How did you learn English?

19:30.879 --> 19:33.965
My grandfather,
he was a doctor in Kabul.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.550
He could speak five languages.

19:35.592 --> 19:38.303
I want to go to America one day,

19:38.345 --> 19:41.306
so I have to be better
before then.

19:41.348 --> 19:44.642
Well, you speak it
very well already.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.895
I want to be able
to play piano there,

19:46.936 --> 19:49.856
but my brother says
I’ll never be good enough.

19:49.898 --> 19:51.274
(chuckles)

19:51.316 --> 19:53.902
Have you ever heard
of Elton John?

19:53.943 --> 19:56.780
-No.
-No?

19:56.821 --> 20:00.075
Elton John is a...

20:00.116 --> 20:03.078
very famous musician.

20:03.119 --> 20:05.330
Plays the piano.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.665
-* ("Benny and the Jets"
by Elton John plays)
-Here.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.668
* She’s got electric boots,
a mohair suit *

20:09.709 --> 20:15.674
* You know I read it
in a magazine, ohh-oh *

20:15.715 --> 20:18.510
* B-B-B Benny and the Jets *

20:23.932 --> 20:26.184
Wears weird sunglasses,

20:26.226 --> 20:29.521
even when he’s indoors.

20:29.562 --> 20:31.523
So we might have
to get you a pair of those.

20:31.564 --> 20:35.026
* Hey kids,
plug into the faithless *

20:35.068 --> 20:37.320
* Maybe they’re blinded *

20:37.362 --> 20:39.406
* But Bennie makes
them ageless *

20:39.447 --> 20:41.491
* We shall survive *

20:41.533 --> 20:43.368
-It’s beautiful.
-* Let us take
ourselves along *

20:43.410 --> 20:46.788
-I want to learn how to play it.
-Yeah, me too.

20:46.830 --> 20:48.998
* Where we fight our parents
out in the streets *

20:49.040 --> 20:51.876
* To find who’s right
and who’s wrong *

20:51.918 --> 20:54.796
The only piano I know of here
is 40 kilometers away.

20:54.838 --> 20:57.507
I’m not allowed to go over there
because of the conflicts.

20:57.549 --> 21:01.761
Hopefully, I will be able to
when the conflict is over.

21:03.763 --> 21:04.681
Yeah.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.768
Once the conflict is over.

21:08.810 --> 21:12.522
You don’t think it’ll be over?

21:12.564 --> 21:15.775
It’s complex.

21:15.817 --> 21:18.570
I think what we’re doing here is

21:18.611 --> 21:22.282
for all the right reasons,

21:22.323 --> 21:25.285
but sometimes good intentions
go wrong.

21:29.372 --> 21:35.253
Solais possible always.

21:35.295 --> 21:37.005
Solais peace, right?

21:42.135 --> 21:44.095
Bryan, can I make you a deal?

21:44.137 --> 21:45.972
You want to make me a deal?

21:48.099 --> 21:50.810
Yeah. Go ahead.
Make me a deal. Shoot.

21:54.439 --> 21:57.067
I will help you find
the Taliban in the village,

21:57.108 --> 21:59.694
show you where they are.

21:59.736 --> 22:01.863
No, it’s not the sort of help
that we need.

22:04.199 --> 22:07.160
Promise me-- Please promise me
nothing will happen to my Baba.

22:07.202 --> 22:10.121
Oh, we’re going to look
after him, but you don’t
need to do anything.

22:10.163 --> 22:12.082
I want to help.

22:12.123 --> 22:13.458
It’s too dangerous.

22:13.500 --> 22:14.709
That’s why we’re here.

22:14.751 --> 22:17.545
I need my Baba to be safe.

22:17.587 --> 22:20.131
I understand that.

22:20.173 --> 22:23.802
Promise?

22:23.843 --> 22:25.804
(exhales)

22:31.059 --> 22:34.020
I promise you,
but stay out of this.

22:35.188 --> 22:37.023
Thank you.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.704
-Still at it?
-Reports are coming in

22:50.745 --> 22:53.790
that Al-Malik is only in Surobi
temporarily to resupply.

22:53.832 --> 22:56.084
-That’s great for us.
-No.

22:56.126 --> 22:58.378
That means there’ll be
out of reach of our operation.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.838
-Beneventi?
-Yeah.

22:59.879 --> 23:01.506
Keep a better eye
on your stuff.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.174
Where did you get this?

23:03.216 --> 23:05.010
The Afghan girl you were
speaking to earlier
in the medical tent?

23:05.051 --> 23:07.053
-Yeah.
-Said she found it
on the ground.

23:09.347 --> 23:11.516
(Bryan whistles)

23:11.558 --> 23:13.143
LEBLANC: What?

23:19.524 --> 23:22.027
Hot damn.
That’s Al-Malik.

23:25.989 --> 23:27.866
FINOLA:
They’ve tried everything.

23:27.907 --> 23:30.285
They still don’t know
what’s happening.

23:30.326 --> 23:32.537
Nothing’s working.

23:32.579 --> 23:34.039
Why Bryan? Why him?

23:34.080 --> 23:38.126
Why was this woman asking
for him specifically?

23:38.168 --> 23:40.879
You remember there was
a piece of Debris

23:40.920 --> 23:43.089
that cloned him
back in Pennsylvania.

23:43.131 --> 23:45.175
You think this is related
to that?

23:45.216 --> 23:49.262
I mean, I am not positive,
but in order to clone him,

23:49.304 --> 23:51.890
the Debris had to have access
to his memories,

23:51.931 --> 23:55.727
and maybe--
maybe at that moment,

23:55.769 --> 24:00.065
his memories just shutter
around every piece of Debris.

24:00.106 --> 24:02.984
And if I am right...

24:03.026 --> 24:05.403
his information was part
of the Debris

24:05.445 --> 24:07.989
that Mariel Caldwell
came into contact with.

24:08.031 --> 24:10.867
Wait a minute,
you’re saying that, what,

24:10.909 --> 24:13.912
that the Debris pieces could be
communicating with each other?

24:13.953 --> 24:15.997
I mean, Laghari himself
speculated

24:16.039 --> 24:18.667
that the Debris uses
the spectrum to communicate,

24:18.708 --> 24:23.171
so is this this really
that far-fetched?

24:23.213 --> 24:25.965
Okay, so you’re basically
saying that Brian’s memory

24:26.007 --> 24:30.929
was backed up into
some sort of a network

24:30.970 --> 24:32.931
that the Debris
is all connected to?

24:32.972 --> 24:33.973
Right.

24:34.015 --> 24:37.644
Everything in our world
is connected.

24:37.686 --> 24:39.604
Why wouldn’t theirs be too?

24:39.646 --> 24:42.732
But why this mission
specifically?

24:42.774 --> 24:45.151
I don’t know.

24:46.528 --> 24:48.446
The Debris read you too,

24:48.488 --> 24:49.823
back in Kansas.

24:50.782 --> 24:52.575
I suppose it did.

24:54.494 --> 24:58.289
Well, if I’m right,

24:58.331 --> 25:01.001
the Debris holds pieces of me
in it’s network too.

25:02.669 --> 25:06.006
-(phone vibrating, beeps)
-Go ahead.

25:06.047 --> 25:08.216
Yeah, we found the Debris
just off one of the trails.

25:08.258 --> 25:09.801
I’m sending you the images
right now.

25:09.843 --> 25:11.219
FINOLA:
Well, shut it down.

25:11.261 --> 25:13.138
See that’s the thing.
It is shut down.

25:13.179 --> 25:16.474
When we found it,
it was barely
registering at .006.

25:16.516 --> 25:17.559
It’s dead.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.728
Has anything changed there?

25:19.769 --> 25:21.604
No. But we saw the shimmer
following her.

25:21.646 --> 25:23.314
And then it disappeared.

25:23.356 --> 25:25.233
It must be part of her now.

25:26.735 --> 25:28.695
Okay, let me call you back.

25:34.034 --> 25:36.661
I think we should try
what you suggested.

25:36.703 --> 25:38.913
What did you suggest?

25:40.331 --> 25:42.584
We could try to reset his brain.

25:42.625 --> 25:43.793
Reboot him.

25:43.835 --> 25:45.670
Electroconvulsive therapy.

25:45.712 --> 25:48.882
Maybe we can disrupt
the connection she has
over him that way.

25:51.051 --> 25:52.969
All right.
Tell me what you need.

25:54.929 --> 25:56.181
Okay.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.647
When was the last time
he had his injection?

26:04.689 --> 26:06.858
Is that what you think
drew it to him?

26:06.900 --> 26:09.194
I’m not so sure.
We just sent him one.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.946
I’ve been monitoring
his blood work for any markers.

26:11.988 --> 26:14.074
They might be losing
their effectiveness.

26:14.115 --> 26:16.326
If he gets out of this,
I want you to up the dosage.

26:23.249 --> 26:24.584
BRYAN:
Asalah!

26:27.629 --> 26:29.255
Believe me now?

26:29.297 --> 26:33.343
It’s one of the bravest things
I have ever seen,

26:33.385 --> 26:35.178
but it is too dangerous.

26:35.220 --> 26:38.264
-You can’t do that.
-You want my country to be free?

26:38.306 --> 26:40.058
-Yes.
-So do I.

26:40.100 --> 26:42.811
We’re all the same--
America, Afghanistan.

26:42.852 --> 26:45.271
Different countries.
But good men are good men,

26:45.313 --> 26:46.398
and bad men are bad men.

26:46.439 --> 26:48.400
I agree with that.

26:48.441 --> 26:49.734
Most people around here--

26:49.776 --> 26:52.946
Don’t see it that way.

26:52.987 --> 26:54.781
I cannot lose my grandfather.

26:54.823 --> 26:57.158
He’s all that I have
to hold on to.

26:57.200 --> 27:00.245
ASALAH: You’ve no idea
how important that is.

27:00.286 --> 27:03.289
And I tried to be brave,

27:03.331 --> 27:05.166
but it is hard to keep hope.

27:05.208 --> 27:08.628
I don’t know how much longer
I can do it without him.

27:10.547 --> 27:14.384
And you have no idea how much
I understand that.

27:22.434 --> 27:24.602
I will not fail you.

27:24.644 --> 27:27.230
I will not fail you.

27:27.272 --> 27:29.691
I promise you,Asalah.

27:29.733 --> 27:33.361
-ORBITAL TECH:
The doctor’s ready.
-FINOLA: Thank you.

27:46.791 --> 27:50.211
Still no response.

27:50.253 --> 27:52.380
It’s the only thing we can do.

27:54.299 --> 27:55.842
Okay.

27:58.511 --> 28:00.764
(electricity surging)

28:05.560 --> 28:08.855
BRYAN: He’s in Surobi.
Those were taken just
a few hours ago.

28:08.897 --> 28:10.482
I don’t wanna know
how you got these.

28:10.523 --> 28:13.526
From what we understand,
they are mostly centralized

28:13.568 --> 28:16.613
in these homes right here,
just off the village square.

28:16.654 --> 28:18.239
-(scream)
-(electricity crackles)

28:19.783 --> 28:21.034
(gasps)

28:21.076 --> 28:23.286
-If we enter--
-From the--

28:23.328 --> 28:24.871
(Mariel gasps)

28:27.624 --> 28:30.043
Come on.

28:30.085 --> 28:31.878
That’ll leave you exposed
along the mountainside.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.505
But when at night,
use darkness for cover.

28:39.803 --> 28:40.762
Come on.

28:40.804 --> 28:42.389
(electricity crackles)

28:48.853 --> 28:50.855
Maddox.

28:54.609 --> 28:56.361
Now, how do you know my name?

28:56.403 --> 29:00.073
(power charging)

29:00.115 --> 29:03.243
(electricity crackling)

29:03.284 --> 29:05.662
-But that will leave you--
-Exposed along the mountainside.

29:05.704 --> 29:07.664
But when at night,
use darkness as cover.

29:07.706 --> 29:10.041
Good work.
We go in tonight.

29:10.083 --> 29:12.919
Yeah, your plan is smart.

29:12.961 --> 29:18.216
Plus we finally have some
usable photos we can I.D.
these guys with.

29:19.968 --> 29:22.053
I’ve been watching you
for a while, Bryan,

29:22.095 --> 29:24.931
I’ve been really impressed
with your accomplishments.

29:24.973 --> 29:27.308
Good luck tonight.

29:27.350 --> 29:29.769
Thank you, sir.

29:29.811 --> 29:34.607
Man, this war
is wearing me down.

29:34.649 --> 29:39.279
Just so easy to forget anything
we’re doing here matters at all.

29:41.740 --> 29:43.408
Everything we’re
doing here matters.

29:43.450 --> 29:46.828
When I joined I thought
we could change the world.

29:46.870 --> 29:48.455
That’s what I thought.

29:48.496 --> 29:50.248
We can.

29:50.290 --> 29:54.085
We’ll see how you feel out there
a couple of more tours.

29:54.127 --> 29:57.130
Look, every war has
its challenges, bro.

29:58.340 --> 30:02.010
Is this about that villager
on the road?

30:02.052 --> 30:04.596
She asked me to protect
her family.

30:06.556 --> 30:08.308
I want to do that.

30:08.350 --> 30:12.604
I want to prove to her
that we can make sense
of this world.

30:12.645 --> 30:15.857
We’re out here to protect
a lot more than one family.

30:21.279 --> 30:23.531
(sighs)
Oh, man.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.328
(sniffs)

30:28.370 --> 30:32.957
She has so much hope.
I wanna protect that.

30:36.252 --> 30:39.422
Oh, man, I need to protect that.

30:39.464 --> 30:42.050
Been a long time since
I thought things could
be good.

30:48.014 --> 30:50.392
Asalah, hey, Asalah.

30:52.602 --> 30:55.814
You need to go home and take
your grandfather to safety...

30:55.855 --> 30:58.024
up to the mountains
and not look back.

30:58.066 --> 31:00.193
Will you find us out there?

31:00.235 --> 31:04.447
Hide by the road that leads
to Jegdalay, where we spoke.

31:04.489 --> 31:06.533
I’ll come check on you after.

31:06.574 --> 31:10.161
The important part
is that you disappear.

31:10.203 --> 31:14.249
That is the best way
that I can ensure your safety,

31:14.290 --> 31:16.001
and your grandfather’s.

31:18.712 --> 31:21.214
Thank you.

31:21.256 --> 31:26.136
I’ve been wondering about
what you said to me earlier,

31:26.177 --> 31:29.055
you told me you know
what it’s like to keep hope,

31:29.097 --> 31:32.475
to have something to hold onto.

31:32.517 --> 31:34.602
I was wondering what
that is for you.

31:46.614 --> 31:48.992
Get your Baba to safety.

31:49.034 --> 31:51.077
(electricity crackles)

31:51.119 --> 31:53.663
From what I understand,
they’re mainly centralized
in these homes

31:53.705 --> 31:55.248
off the village square.

31:55.290 --> 31:57.959
Please, Bryan.
Please, just wake up.

31:58.001 --> 32:01.087
MARIEL:
We’re trapping Al-Malik
from the north and south.

32:01.129 --> 32:02.464
(electricity crackles)

32:16.353 --> 32:17.687
Move it.

32:21.191 --> 32:23.151
(speaking Pashto)

32:23.193 --> 32:26.488
(speaking Pashto)

32:26.529 --> 32:28.948
NELSON (on speaker):
All stations,
troops in contact!

32:28.990 --> 32:30.325
We are under fire.
Repeat--

32:39.501 --> 32:42.087
-Contact.
-(gunfire in distance)

32:46.633 --> 32:47.967
Reloading.

32:48.009 --> 32:49.719
Lay down some hate, Frenchie!

32:59.646 --> 33:01.106
Decided to show up?

33:01.147 --> 33:02.607
Get Frenchie in!

33:02.649 --> 33:03.692
Frenchie!

33:05.735 --> 33:07.195
Frag out!

33:16.579 --> 33:17.706
(groans)

33:17.747 --> 33:20.333
Hey. Don’t move.

33:20.375 --> 33:22.961
Cease-fire! Cease-fire!

33:23.003 --> 33:25.130
I know what’s gonna happen here.

33:25.171 --> 33:27.757
I know what’s gonna happen.

33:27.799 --> 33:29.509
What are you talking about?

33:31.636 --> 33:33.263
Get down.

33:33.304 --> 33:34.681
I have to stop it.

33:47.861 --> 33:50.321
(wind blowing)

34:02.083 --> 34:03.251
(whispers)
I have to stop it.

35:39.514 --> 35:42.559
Why?

35:42.600 --> 35:45.228
Why did you make me
go through this again?

35:45.270 --> 35:46.730
Why me?

36:06.583 --> 36:07.917
(electricity crackles)

36:07.959 --> 36:08.918
(gasping)

36:08.960 --> 36:10.378
Bryan! Bryan!

36:10.420 --> 36:12.797
You’re okay.
You’re okay.

36:16.634 --> 36:17.719
Hey.

36:19.721 --> 36:22.182
Mariel...

36:22.223 --> 36:24.142
I need to see her.

36:24.184 --> 36:29.522
-I need to see her.
-Okay. Yeah.

36:36.780 --> 36:38.615
GOLDMAN:
She’s dead.

37:01.346 --> 37:05.392
Hey, I know about Asalah.

37:05.433 --> 37:08.353
You’re okay.

37:08.395 --> 37:09.854
You’re okay.

37:18.863 --> 37:23.493
he told me that Asalah heard
that we were gonna be ambushed,

37:23.535 --> 37:26.996
and...

37:27.038 --> 37:30.875
and she was so worried
that I would think
that she had betrayed me...

37:34.462 --> 37:37.424
...that she came back
to the village to warn me.

37:44.139 --> 37:47.726
So the next night,

37:47.767 --> 37:51.521
we went up into the mountains
with my unit on a follow-on op

37:51.563 --> 37:55.859
to see if we could find
any of the Taliban that
might have escaped.

37:55.900 --> 37:59.487
Sure enough, we found some
of them hiding in a cave.

38:02.949 --> 38:04.284
So I took revenge.

38:06.745 --> 38:11.583
I didn’t know at the time
that that was a different
group of insurgents,

38:11.624 --> 38:13.543
protected group team
not to be touched,

38:13.585 --> 38:18.381
because of some ongoing
CIA operation.

38:18.423 --> 38:21.426
And is that why
you were in prison?

38:23.928 --> 38:26.931
And I probably still would be
if Maddox hadn’t have pulled
me out.

38:29.142 --> 38:31.353
They were going to charge me
with a war crime.

38:38.234 --> 38:40.236
Here.

38:40.278 --> 38:41.237
Thank you.

38:47.243 --> 38:50.663
I don’t carry this
so that I can remember her.

38:53.291 --> 38:55.502
I carry it so I don’t forget

38:55.543 --> 38:58.254
what it’s like to invest
in something that I can lose.

39:09.349 --> 39:12.977
Can you remember anything else

39:13.019 --> 39:15.605
about your experience?

39:15.647 --> 39:18.775
Why it happened?

39:18.817 --> 39:21.820
I don’t think it was over
when you pulled me out.

39:21.861 --> 39:29.744
I asked her why I had to relive
that-- that memory.

39:29.786 --> 39:32.247
It showed you for a reason.

39:32.288 --> 39:34.374
It felt like that.

39:34.416 --> 39:38.336
I think all of the Debris
may be connected.

39:42.340 --> 39:43.967
What?

39:44.009 --> 39:48.847
I think the Debris
is experiencing us

39:48.888 --> 39:52.017
the same way that
we’re experiencing it.

39:52.976 --> 39:54.269
I agree.

39:56.021 --> 39:58.732
(phone vibrates)

39:58.773 --> 40:02.235
(sighs)

40:02.277 --> 40:04.612
Ferris just sent me
the Laghari files.

40:07.866 --> 40:12.662
Hey, are you going to be okay?

40:12.704 --> 40:13.705
Yeah.

40:15.040 --> 40:16.499
Okay.

40:18.418 --> 40:21.921
Okay, I’m gonna go
and call my dad.

40:21.963 --> 40:23.423
Thank you.

40:26.634 --> 40:29.429
(machine whirring)

40:45.070 --> 40:49.324
I decided to start with
doubling your dose, all right?

40:49.366 --> 40:52.452
What happened to me had nothing
to do with the injections not
working.

40:52.494 --> 40:55.830
We have to cover all of
our bases and make sure.

40:55.872 --> 41:00.377
I wish you hadn’t
have stopped it.

41:00.418 --> 41:02.879
I could have learned more.

41:02.921 --> 41:06.341
Hey, you might not have
survived.

41:06.383 --> 41:08.385
It was too much for her system.

41:08.426 --> 41:11.054
You happened to be a little
stronger, that’s all.

41:11.096 --> 41:13.723
But you were almost there.

41:13.765 --> 41:16.893
So I don’t know why
this happened to you.

41:16.935 --> 41:21.064
I just know that I don’t want it
to happen again.

41:21.106 --> 41:26.611
As far as I know,
you’re the only person
Debris has ever sought out.

41:46.131 --> 41:49.634
DAHKEYA: It all began when
the Black Water Grandfather

41:49.676 --> 41:53.680
threw his energy
to the four directions.

41:53.722 --> 41:57.809
To the east, he laid black metal
in the earth.

41:59.185 --> 42:01.813
To the south, blue metal.

42:01.855 --> 42:05.483
To the west, yellow metal.

42:05.525 --> 42:08.236
And to the north, white metal.

42:11.239 --> 42:15.160
In the next phase,
Black Water Grandfather

42:15.201 --> 42:18.079
threw black wind

42:18.121 --> 42:19.456
towards the earth.

42:29.674 --> 42:32.135
MAN: We have found
Agent Beneventi. Over.

42:32.177 --> 42:33.803
(beep)

42:33.845 --> 42:35.680
Repeat.
We’ve found Agent Beneventi.

42:35.722 --> 42:38.725
(beep)

42:38.767 --> 42:41.269
WOMAN:
He’s in a state of confusion.

42:41.311 --> 42:42.645
There’s a laceration
on his chin

42:42.687 --> 42:45.065
and a wound on his upper chest.

42:45.106 --> 42:46.274
(beep)

42:49.652 --> 42:51.154
MAN:
What the hell happened
to these men?

42:51.196 --> 42:52.364
(beep)
