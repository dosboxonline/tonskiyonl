- [audience chuckling]
- I think the last answer

00:44.566 --> 00:46.698
is misleading, and we could not
accurately describe our guest

it would be too misleading

to suggest that our guest had a
basic affiliation with sports.

Arlene: Do you use
anything in your hands

that he's a performer?

that he was asked

02:05.386 --> 02:07.257
if he had anything
to do with the arts

02:07.431 --> 02:09.041
and then was asked

10:06.257 --> 10:08.259
There is a universal fixation
on penis length.

10:08.433 --> 10:11.088
No mortal penis can hope
to live up to this expectation.

10:11.262 --> 10:13.656
Therefore, I, Dalí,
will build the ultimate penis

10:13.830 --> 10:15.658
to relieve the world
of its anxiety.

10:15.832 --> 10:18.095
And how will Dalí
make his penis?

10:18.269 --> 10:21.142
Dalí's penis will be constructed
of pink nylon mesh.

10:21.316 --> 10:24.536
It will have a diameter
of approximately two meters.

10:24.711 --> 10:27.975
You will be encouraged
to stand inside it.

10:28.236 --> 10:29.759
And how long
will Dalí's penis be?

10:29.933 --> 10:31.282
It will circle the planet.

10:31.456 --> 10:33.110
And how will
your penis cross the ocean?

10:33.284 --> 10:35.852
Like telephone cables
on the floor of the ocean.

10:36.113 --> 10:38.420
And when the penis,
it is finished,

10:38.594 --> 10:41.118
it will ejaculate
over the United Nations.

10:41.292 --> 10:42.990
My contribution to world peace.

10:43.381 --> 10:46.515
[all chuckle]

10:49.561 --> 10:52.129
[grandfather clock chiming]

10:54.828 --> 10:56.090
Dalí: Mais qu'est-ce que tu...

10:56.264 --> 10:57.395
- No, no, no.
- [indistinct chatter]

11:00.660 --> 11:01.922
He's autographing it.

11:02.357 --> 11:03.663
They never cash the check.

11:17.502 --> 11:18.939
Are you here for Gala?

11:19.722 --> 11:21.289
Why does everyone
seem to think that?

11:22.551 --> 11:23.683
This face maybe?

11:24.596 --> 11:26.947
I... I work at Dalí's gallery,
actually.

11:27.730 --> 11:29.210
But that's not why you're here.

11:29.558 --> 11:31.995
If you're not here for Gala,
then you must be here for Dalí.

11:32.866 --> 11:33.997
There's always a reason.

11:35.520 --> 11:36.870
What's your reason then?

11:37.044 --> 11:38.698
Oh, I'm like Dalí's jewelry.

11:39.437 --> 11:40.525
Something pretty.

11:41.222 --> 11:42.266
Nice to wear at parties.

11:43.093 --> 11:44.225
Amanda: There she is.

11:44.921 --> 11:46.793
Come on, darling.
The ship is leaving.

11:46.967 --> 11:47.924
Ginesta: Okay, sure.

11:49.230 --> 11:50.100
Goodnight.

11:52.668 --> 11:54.714
[chuckles] I'm coming.

11:56.716 --> 11:58.500
- Waiter 1: Did you see this?
- He did that now?

11:58.674 --> 11:59.762
Yeah, right in front of me.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.156
- Just before he signed.
- Waiter 2: Wow.

12:02.330 --> 12:08.118
[rousing music playing]

12:40.194 --> 12:42.283
Christoffe: Is this some
little conceptual art piece?

12:43.066 --> 12:45.025
Maybe you should
be working downtown.

12:45.199 --> 12:46.896
So, the whole idea
of a signature

12:47.070 --> 12:50.334
is that it should identify
an artist definitively. Right?

12:50.900 --> 12:52.510
- Uh, yeah.
- But Dalí...

12:52.772 --> 12:54.425
has a few dozen signatures.

12:54.817 --> 12:57.167
Why?
What does that say about him?

12:57.689 --> 12:59.256
My dear boy, Dalí adores,

12:59.430 --> 13:01.781
as he calls it,
"to cretinize the world."

13:02.303 --> 13:03.695
- Cretinize?
- Yeah.

13:04.044 --> 13:05.306
He wants to confuse,

13:05.480 --> 13:06.873
to obfuscate,
to fuck with people.

13:07.221 --> 13:11.225
Or... to show people
that nothing is what it seems.

13:11.616 --> 13:12.617
Including himself.

13:12.966 --> 13:13.923
[door opening]

13:15.098 --> 13:16.534
- Well, we're off to lunch...
- [Dalí humming]

13:16.708 --> 13:18.101
...but first, Gala wants to see

13:18.275 --> 13:20.147
how you plan
to hang the new works.

13:20.321 --> 13:21.801
Christoffe: Right.

13:22.149 --> 13:23.672
But we can expect more prints
and paintings this week?

13:23.846 --> 13:25.630
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- Show me the room.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.458
How do you plan
to hang the show?

13:27.632 --> 13:28.938
- Here, follow me.
- [Dalí humming]

13:31.027 --> 13:35.771
- [Dalí humming]
- [indistinct conversation]

13:39.427 --> 13:41.951
"It's our pleasure
to serve you."

13:45.302 --> 13:47.348
This is a beautiful blue.

13:49.654 --> 13:52.222
Blue is the color of oxygen.

13:55.356 --> 13:57.140
- Excuse me, Señor Dalí.
- Dalí: Hmm.

13:58.098 --> 13:59.839
- This is for you.
- Dalí: Hmm.

14:05.018 --> 14:06.019
What is this?

14:07.934 --> 14:09.283
All these, "Dalí, Dalí, Dalí"?

14:10.023 --> 14:11.198
I made it for you.

14:11.720 --> 14:14.114
I'm so sorry, Dalí. Dalí.
My new assistant,

14:14.679 --> 14:16.203
he's a fan.
Don't let him bother you.

14:16.377 --> 14:17.813
I saw
that they were all different...

14:19.206 --> 14:21.469
as if each one
was a new version of you,

14:21.643 --> 14:24.776
as if you became a new person
each time you painted.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.737
You have a face of an angel.

14:30.304 --> 14:31.218
I do?

14:32.132 --> 14:33.611
Not boy, not girl.

14:34.743 --> 14:35.962
Are you Raphael?

14:37.485 --> 14:38.486
No!

14:39.226 --> 14:40.401
You are San Sebastian,

14:40.749 --> 14:42.229
by Gustave Moreau.

14:44.187 --> 14:46.320
Dalí can keep this,
San Sebastian?

14:46.494 --> 14:47.495
Yeah.

14:49.976 --> 14:51.064
I need a new assistant.

14:51.803 --> 14:54.197
I will borrow this boy
until the show,

14:55.068 --> 14:56.199
then you have him back.

15:03.380 --> 15:04.816
James: Please let me do this,
Christoffe.

15:04.991 --> 15:06.557
One of the great artists
of the twentieth century

15:06.731 --> 15:07.994
wants me to work with him.

15:08.168 --> 15:10.344
Oh, look at you.
No one works with Dalí.

15:10.518 --> 15:12.781
- They work for him.
- Christoffe.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.218
Come on, just think about this,
okay?

15:15.392 --> 15:18.743
I mean, I will... I will do
overtime later, all right?

15:20.006 --> 15:22.573
Look, I'll work free for a week.
Two weeks, whatever.

15:22.747 --> 15:24.706
I will make it up
to you somehow, I promise.

15:28.405 --> 15:29.319
All right.

15:30.973 --> 15:33.367
Gala has committed him
to too many contracts

15:33.540 --> 15:34.803
that have nothing
to do with the show

15:34.977 --> 15:36.196
and now he's exhausted.

15:36.631 --> 15:38.111
But we open in three weeks,

15:38.372 --> 15:40.069
and I still have a whole wall
to fill with paintings.

15:40.591 --> 15:41.853
So, here's the deal.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.421
You are going
to keep an eye on him,

15:44.595 --> 15:46.075
and tell me everything,

15:46.423 --> 15:48.251
and make sure he paints.

15:49.470 --> 15:52.038
He gets so sidetracked
by his holograms...

15:52.690 --> 15:55.128
- his parties and orgies.
- Orgies?

15:55.650 --> 15:56.694
Not part of the job.

15:57.695 --> 16:01.047
[whimsical music playing]

16:09.446 --> 16:12.972
[Dalí humming]

16:17.802 --> 16:20.892
[humming]

16:38.910 --> 16:42.958
[eerie music playing]

16:43.872 --> 16:45.787
- [door knocking]
- Come.

16:47.267 --> 16:48.355
Bring it here.

16:51.271 --> 16:53.838
The Queen of Cups...

16:54.013 --> 16:55.884
- I'll just leave this here.
- Wait, wait.

16:59.453 --> 17:00.671
Page of Cups.

17:05.241 --> 17:06.199
Open it.

17:22.519 --> 17:23.520
Sit down.

17:26.132 --> 17:28.047
I'm sorry,
I don't... I don't think I'm...

17:28.786 --> 17:30.310
I just... I just...
I don't, um...

17:32.312 --> 17:34.879
I have a lot of errands
and things, so, um...

17:35.054 --> 17:36.142
Gala: Idiot!

17:36.490 --> 17:37.447
Go.

17:38.187 --> 17:40.189
Go work for Dalí.

17:40.363 --> 17:46.021
[pensive music playing]

17:52.114 --> 17:54.334
Stop, stop, stop! Too much!

17:56.292 --> 17:57.250
Gala!

17:57.424 --> 17:58.860
I could find her if you'd like.

17:59.034 --> 18:00.470
Galushka!

18:00.644 --> 18:01.558
[sighs]

18:03.647 --> 18:05.432
Gala!

18:06.259 --> 18:07.086
Help.

18:08.739 --> 18:11.002
Idiot. You don't learn?

18:11.438 --> 18:14.571
One part linseed, one varnish,
three paint.

18:18.358 --> 18:19.359
What do you see?

18:21.709 --> 18:24.712
There's more energy on the left
than on the right.

18:24.886 --> 18:25.756
Dalí: Hmm.

18:27.932 --> 18:29.238
- Hmm.
- Your medicine.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.634
- Take it.
- Yes, yes, Galina.

18:41.772 --> 18:44.210
Will you join us for lunch,
my olivetta?

18:44.471 --> 18:46.603
No. I go to the theater,

18:46.777 --> 18:48.301
but keep working.

18:48.866 --> 18:49.824
Keep painting.

18:56.439 --> 18:57.527
[door closes]

18:59.747 --> 19:00.704
I need her

19:01.923 --> 19:02.793
to push me.

19:04.273 --> 19:06.710
Without my Gala,
I would end up in an asylum

19:06.884 --> 19:08.538
or be a tramp under a bridge.

19:09.539 --> 19:11.846
Bring me Naples Yellow.

19:15.154 --> 19:18.679
It's my favorite color.
Yellow is the color of proteins.

19:19.854 --> 19:21.508
To find me the Naples Yellow,

19:22.161 --> 19:24.032
Gala would walk all over Paris.

19:24.641 --> 19:26.339
- Is that where you met?
- Dalí: No.

19:38.873 --> 19:40.222
We met in Cadaques,

19:42.442 --> 19:44.357
the most beautiful place
on Earth.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.317
The first thing I saw of Gala

19:49.579 --> 19:50.711
was her wonderful back.

19:50.885 --> 19:53.844
[soft music playing]

20:11.210 --> 20:14.909
[tense music playing]

20:51.032 --> 20:52.251
I was so beautiful.

20:53.817 --> 20:56.951
See? Luis Buñuel was visiting.

20:57.778 --> 21:00.389
And René Magritte
and his boring wife.

21:01.347 --> 21:02.435
And Gala!

21:07.266 --> 21:08.658
My friend, the poet,

21:09.442 --> 21:10.399
Paul EÉluard.

21:11.574 --> 21:12.749
Gala's husband.

21:15.796 --> 21:21.236
[laughs]

21:21.410 --> 21:24.195
Dalí: I had many terrors
and strange fits of laughter

21:24.370 --> 21:25.501
when I was young.

21:25.675 --> 21:28.112
[Young Dalí laughs hysterically]

21:28.287 --> 21:29.766
People whispered I was mad.

21:30.811 --> 21:35.903
[Young Dalí laughs hysterically]

21:40.516 --> 21:45.391
[breathes shakily]

21:45.565 --> 21:48.829
[soft music playing]

22:26.823 --> 22:27.824
Water.

22:28.042 --> 22:29.260
[music fades]

22:40.837 --> 22:42.752
That happens sometimes
when I am tired.

22:43.797 --> 22:45.364
Don't worry, San Sebastian.

22:46.321 --> 22:48.062
[clears throat]
Dalí only need a little air.

22:48.236 --> 22:49.933
This will give me strength.

22:50.238 --> 22:51.326
Are you sure?

22:52.196 --> 22:53.720
Won't Gala be upset
if you leave?

22:55.156 --> 22:56.505
She is with Jesus.

22:57.201 --> 22:58.551
She'll be gone for hours.

22:59.813 --> 23:01.902
- Jesus?
- You will meet him.

23:03.033 --> 23:04.252
Tomorrow.

23:04.905 --> 23:08.474
San Sebastian, you will join us
at the Prince and Pauper's tea.

23:08.648 --> 23:10.214
- Prince and Pauper's?
- Yeah.

23:10.389 --> 23:12.129
You, of course, are a pauper.
You are young.

23:12.303 --> 23:13.696
[rousing music playing]

23:13.870 --> 23:15.437
The old are there
strictly for business,

23:15.611 --> 23:18.005
otherwise, I cannot
bear to look at them.

23:24.968 --> 23:28.058
[indistinct chatter]

23:28.755 --> 23:29.712
Where have you been?

23:29.930 --> 23:31.105
It was my day at the gallery.

23:31.279 --> 23:32.672
Dalí's done nothing today.

23:32.846 --> 23:34.369
He's over there
talking to Alice Cooper

23:34.543 --> 23:36.980
about another hologram.
How do you sell a hologram?

23:37.285 --> 23:39.679
- [piano playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

23:39.853 --> 23:41.202
Dalí: Yes, it is true.

23:41.376 --> 23:45.206
Holographics
is the ultimate art form.

23:45.380 --> 23:49.079
What about painting, Dalí,
and sculptures?

23:49.253 --> 23:50.777
Yes, yes, Alice.

23:51.081 --> 23:53.954
But Dalí create,
at one and the same time,

23:54.128 --> 23:56.957
the external
and internal reality

23:57.131 --> 23:58.306
through different methods.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.874
Double images, stereoscopy,

24:01.483 --> 24:05.356
holograms for seeking
the fourth dimension,

24:05.531 --> 24:07.010
penetrating more and more

24:07.184 --> 24:09.491
into the compressed nature
of the universe.

24:09.665 --> 24:10.666
Compress-ed?

24:10.840 --> 24:12.276
Compressed, compressed.

24:12.799 --> 24:13.930
Did he say compressed?

24:14.104 --> 24:15.454
Dalí: Come, San Sebastian.

24:17.238 --> 24:19.762
Meet my Ginesta.
She's very Dalínian.

24:20.415 --> 24:21.329
Ginesta.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.331
[indistinct chatter]

24:23.505 --> 24:26.029
You take care of San Sebastian.

24:26.203 --> 24:28.641
- He is a new boy.
- We've already met, Dalí.

24:29.859 --> 24:30.904
[chuckles]

24:34.081 --> 24:36.562
So, are you a prince
or are you a pauper?

24:36.736 --> 24:38.564
Pauper, for sure.

24:38.738 --> 24:39.913
I thought so.

24:40.609 --> 24:41.828
Where are you from, James?

24:42.306 --> 24:44.178
- Uh, Idaho.
- Oh, my.

24:44.657 --> 24:45.962
What was that like?

24:46.310 --> 24:49.488
All I knew about art was
from books and magazines,

24:49.662 --> 24:52.403
so being here is kind of
like a dream, I guess.

24:53.143 --> 24:55.276
Do your parents know
what you're up to in New York?

24:55.450 --> 24:57.583
My mother says
seven-layer cake is sinful,

24:57.757 --> 24:59.410
so you can guess
what she would say

24:59.585 --> 25:01.848
about Dalí and... and all this.

25:02.196 --> 25:05.025
My father thinks
Dalí is a pornographer,

25:05.199 --> 25:06.809
- which I love.
- [door opening]

25:08.768 --> 25:11.466

41:09.597 --> 41:10.642
He and Gala...

41:12.774 --> 41:14.950
I think they had sex
like a million years ago.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.780
And I think she's the only one
that he could ever do it with.

41:21.304 --> 41:22.523
It must be so lonely.

until the show is finished.

41:44.197 --> 41:45.677

41:53.641 --> 41:55.600

like dogs?

41:55.774 --> 41:57.906
I will not eat from tin spoons.

41:58.167 --> 42:02.084
I will never again live
in a house that stinks of onion

42:02.258 --> 42:04.652
or eat pig blood for breakfast.

42:05.174 --> 42:07.437
I will not be poor!

42:07.655 --> 42:09.875
- Olivina, please.
- Gala: No, "please."

42:10.049 --> 42:11.572

42:12.007 --> 42:13.618

for this fucking show!

42:17.491 --> 42:18.666

42:19.058 --> 42:20.973
and paint, and paint

42:21.147 --> 42:25.194

nothing but painting!

42:58.010 --> 43:01.970
Is she magnificent, my Gala?
Did you hear her yell?

43:02.144 --> 43:04.190
She slapped The Captain,
then she kicked me.

43:04.364 --> 43:05.931
Such rage, like a fire.

43:06.540 --> 43:07.802
I thought you would be upset.

No! It is anger makes us strong.

burst from the shell of hatred.

43:24.384 --> 43:25.428

43:25.603 --> 43:26.429
Ginesta? Why?

43:26.604 --> 43:27.866
For the angel's wings.

43:28.127 --> 43:29.650

hang in the Vatican.

43:29.824 --> 43:31.478
These wings I create
with the perfect ass of a model,

43:31.652 --> 43:33.828

And Amanda,

01:10:42.237 --> 01:10:43.064
Captain Moore: As you see.

01:10:43.239 --> 01:10:44.544
James: How do you know

01:10:44.805 --> 01:10:46.242
they're printing
what they're supposed to?

01:10:46.459 --> 01:10:48.287
Why would anyone print
anything other than a Dalí?

01:10:48.809 --> 01:10:51.072
He's the most famous
living artist in the world.

01:10:52.465 --> 01:10:55.425
[rousing music playing]

01:10:59.385 --> 01:11:00.734
- Amanda: James.
- James: Hey!

01:11:03.346 --> 01:11:04.782
- Good trip?
- Amanda: Not too bad.

01:11:08.699 --> 01:11:10.353
Amanda: So, Jeff is at Púbol?

01:11:10.527 --> 01:11:12.093
- Yeah.
- That's why Gala was pleading

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:13.746
to get me here.

01:11:13.921 --> 01:11:16.402
Keep Dalí company,
so she can be with Fenholt.

01:11:16.576 --> 01:11:19.318
[sighs] You know, sometimes
I think Gala and Dalí don't like

01:11:19.492 --> 01:11:21.668
to be around each other
because it reminds them

01:11:21.842 --> 01:11:23.844
that they're old.

01:11:24.932 --> 01:11:25.933
It's so difficult.

01:11:27.587 --> 01:11:29.981
But tonight,
I think we'll have fun.

01:11:31.852 --> 01:11:34.333
Dalí promised
to take us somewhere special.

01:11:45.779 --> 01:11:47.651
Dalí: Behold, San Sebastian...

01:11:48.304 --> 01:11:49.348
The Cap de Creus!

01:11:52.003 --> 01:11:54.614
[in Russian]

01:12:12.153 --> 01:12:14.764
[pensive music playing]

01:12:33.392 --> 01:12:35.568
[wind whooshing]

01:12:36.874 --> 01:12:37.918
Look there.

01:12:39.572 --> 01:12:42.053
- This rock is in my painting.
- Amanda: Uh-huh. Oh!

01:12:43.097 --> 01:12:44.360
Dalí: The Great Masturbator.

01:12:45.186 --> 01:12:47.275
Oh, yes. I see it.

01:12:49.930 --> 01:12:52.541
[rousing music playing]

01:12:53.412 --> 01:12:55.282
Dalí: The Tramontana,
San Sebastian.

01:12:55.675 --> 01:12:58.286
The wind is coming from Africa
down the mountains,

01:12:58.460 --> 01:12:59.723
but we must be careful.

01:12:59.897 --> 01:13:01.725
It can blow for days.

01:13:01.898 --> 01:13:02.769
Make you mad.

01:13:12.126 --> 01:13:14.389
[wind whooshing]

01:13:18.829 --> 01:13:20.178
What are you doing?

01:13:20.352 --> 01:13:22.398
When I was a child,
and the Tramontana blew,

01:13:22.572 --> 01:13:23.702
I'd go up on the roof,

01:13:23.877 --> 01:13:26.010
and like this,
I conduct the wind!

01:13:33.539 --> 01:13:34.800
- Ah! Woah!
- [Amanda gasps]

01:13:34.975 --> 01:13:35.976
- [groans]
- James: Dalí!

01:13:37.325 --> 01:13:39.197
[groans]

01:13:40.154 --> 01:13:41.373
- Amanda: Oh, my God.
- [James grunts]

01:13:41.547 --> 01:13:42.505
Dalí: Am I bleeding?

01:13:42.983 --> 01:13:45.464
No, no. Just a bruise, maybe.

01:13:45.638 --> 01:13:47.335
We go to the doctor then,
to see.

01:13:47.510 --> 01:13:50.600
No, Dalí. You are fine.
Just get your breath.

01:13:53.210 --> 01:13:54.299
I wish Gala were here.

01:13:56.996 --> 01:13:59.130
This is where she asked me
to kill her, you know?

01:14:00.392 --> 01:14:02.263
Young Gala: [in Russian]

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:04.440
[grunts, pants]

01:14:05.223 --> 01:14:07.530
[in French]

01:14:08.052 --> 01:14:10.271
- [Young Gala groans]
- [exhales deeply]

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:15.320
[wind whooshing]

01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:36.297
[tense music playing]

01:14:37.037 --> 01:14:37.951
[breathes heavily]

01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:51.617
[Young Dalí grunts]

01:14:57.057 --> 01:14:58.014
[groans]

01:15:00.103 --> 01:15:02.672
[somber music playing]

01:15:07.023 --> 01:15:09.068
I was very tempted
that day to throw her off.

01:15:10.157 --> 01:15:12.638
Do you really think
Gala wanted you to kill her?

01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:15.119
Even Dalí does not know
everything about Gala.

01:15:15.293 --> 01:15:17.164
She's the secret
within my secret.

01:15:18.469 --> 01:15:19.732
But that day,

01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:21.559
I saw, in her heart,

01:15:22.082 --> 01:15:23.648
the same madness as in mine.

01:15:25.216 --> 01:15:26.739
I found my other half.

01:15:37.402 --> 01:15:38.359
[music fades]

01:15:40.057 --> 01:15:42.014
[waves crashing]

01:15:43.190 --> 01:15:44.235
Hey, Captain?

01:15:44.757 --> 01:15:46.019
- [chuckles, gasps]
- James: Oh.

01:15:46.672 --> 01:15:47.499
Sorry.

01:15:48.152 --> 01:15:49.980
This is Sabater,
the new secretary.

01:15:50.981 --> 01:15:52.025
Where's The Captain?

01:15:52.591 --> 01:15:54.375
He's gone. He steals.

01:15:55.507 --> 01:15:57.291
Sabater is also younger
and more intelligent.

01:15:57.987 --> 01:15:59.424
What do you mean,
The Captain steals?

01:16:00.032 --> 01:16:01.818
He's gone. This is all.

01:16:08.737 --> 01:16:10.304
Captain Moore:
With the prints, it's a mess.

01:16:10.522 --> 01:16:12.175
No proper controls.

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:16.093
Too many dealers,
unlimited limited editions.

01:16:16.746 --> 01:16:18.704
Do you remember the...
the Carter Gallery in New York?

01:16:18.878 --> 01:16:20.576
The place I went
to collect cash?

01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:22.577
Well,
I suspect that most of his stock

01:16:22.752 --> 01:16:24.405
is unauthorized reprints.

01:16:25.362 --> 01:16:29.236
Photocopies of lithos
sold as originals.

01:16:30.541 --> 01:16:32.109
When I was
at the Carter Gallery,

01:16:32.282 --> 01:16:34.807
I convinced a woman
to buy some Dalí lithographs.

01:16:35.895 --> 01:16:37.853
She spent 15,000 dollars.

01:16:38.289 --> 01:16:39.333
You didn't know.

01:16:40.683 --> 01:16:42.467
For that matter,
they may have been authentic.

01:16:43.337 --> 01:16:44.687
But you don't believe that,
do you?

01:16:52.172 --> 01:16:53.478
That was her inheritance.

01:16:54.740 --> 01:16:56.307
God,
how did they let this happen?

01:16:56.699 --> 01:16:59.397
Gala never keeps track
of the signed blank sheets.

01:16:59.571 --> 01:17:00.833
Out of sight, out of mind.

01:17:01.442 --> 01:17:02.791
Hamon in Paris.

01:17:04.445 --> 01:17:06.099
He prints cheap copies too,
doesn't he?

01:17:06.752 --> 01:17:08.493
Passes them off as lithographs.

01:17:08.798 --> 01:17:10.364
I mean,
I try to keep some order,

01:17:10.538 --> 01:17:13.367
but Gala's hunger
for cash is insatiable.

01:17:13.759 --> 01:17:15.152
And what does Dalí know?

01:17:15.326 --> 01:17:16.675
Dalí doesn't want to know.

01:17:16.849 --> 01:17:19.199
He wants Gala
to look after everything.

01:17:20.592 --> 01:17:22.246
He can't even pay
for a taxi on his own,

01:17:22.420 --> 01:17:24.465
- you know that.
- And you brought me into this?

01:17:24.770 --> 01:17:26.119
Well, you wanted the job.

01:17:27.599 --> 01:17:28.818
They wanted the money.

01:17:29.557 --> 01:17:32.082
It's a hungry market out there,
James.

01:17:33.170 --> 01:17:35.259
A painting's never
just a painting.

01:17:35.955 --> 01:17:36.869
Not anymore.

01:17:39.002 --> 01:17:40.351
What did you think was going on?

01:17:40.873 --> 01:17:42.396
Well, I suspected something,
but...

01:17:42.614 --> 01:17:43.833
But you stayed.

01:17:45.443 --> 01:17:46.487
I stayed.

01:17:47.314 --> 01:17:49.228
Captain Moore:
Dalí's hemorrhaging money,

01:17:49.403 --> 01:17:51.928
you know,
between their extravagances

01:17:52.102 --> 01:17:54.407
and the money
that Gala spends on Fenholt.

01:17:55.192 --> 01:17:58.717
Do you know that she gave him
one of Dalí's paintings,

01:17:58.891 --> 01:18:01.677
a portrait of Gala,
worth a fortune?

01:18:02.416 --> 01:18:05.681
And I hear that
he's just sold it at Sotheby's.

01:18:06.594 --> 01:18:07.552
He sold it?

01:18:09.684 --> 01:18:11.904
I gave Dalí 20 years of my life,

01:18:13.123 --> 01:18:15.995
and when I was with him,
he made millions.

01:18:18.737 --> 01:18:20.085
But now I fear that he's...

01:18:21.174 --> 01:18:22.567
he's going to die poor.

01:18:26.136 --> 01:18:28.050
Gala told me
you stole from Dalí.

01:18:28.355 --> 01:18:29.574
Is that true?

01:18:30.706 --> 01:18:31.707
Certainly not.

01:18:39.584 --> 01:18:41.193
[phone ringing]

01:18:44.371 --> 01:18:45.416
Hello?

01:18:46.112 --> 01:18:48.288
James: Hi, Christoffe.
It's James.

01:18:49.028 --> 01:18:50.029
James.

01:18:50.856 --> 01:18:51.857
How are you?

01:18:52.423 --> 01:18:53.816
I have to ask you a question.

01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:58.516
Dalí: Rest your weight there.
Hmm. Yes. Yes.

01:19:09.396 --> 01:19:10.441
San Sebastian.

01:19:11.572 --> 01:19:13.661
Dalí, I found something out
from Captain Moore.

01:19:14.706 --> 01:19:16.273
Thought it was something
you should know.

01:19:17.927 --> 01:19:19.014
Please.

01:19:21.365 --> 01:19:23.759
He told me Gala gave a painting
of yours to Jeff Fenholt.

01:19:26.326 --> 01:19:27.675
What? What painting?

01:19:28.285 --> 01:19:29.764
A portrait you did of Gala.

01:19:31.809 --> 01:19:32.811
It isn't true.

01:19:33.464 --> 01:19:35.205
Captain Moore told you
this to hurt Dalí.

01:19:35.379 --> 01:19:36.728
Gala would never give
Jesus Christ

01:19:36.902 --> 01:19:38.034
one of my paintings.

01:19:39.252 --> 01:19:40.297
James: It's true.

01:19:42.559 --> 01:19:43.691
[sighs] How do you know?

01:19:44.344 --> 01:19:45.868
I know
because I called Christoffe.

01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:50.786
You called New York?

01:19:52.264 --> 01:19:53.136
James: Yes.

01:19:55.965 --> 01:19:57.053
On my telephone?

01:19:57.835 --> 01:19:59.055
He confirmed it with Sotheby's.

01:20:00.708 --> 01:20:03.362
How dare you call long distance
on my bill?

01:20:04.625 --> 01:20:06.758
I employ you
for weeks and months.

01:20:06.932 --> 01:20:08.281
I allow you

01:20:08.455 --> 01:20:09.978
to be in the presence of Dalí,
of genius.

01:20:10.153 --> 01:20:11.719
I give you this opportunity,

01:20:11.981 --> 01:20:14.026
and you piss on me,
waste my money

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:16.072
by calling long distance
without permission!

01:20:16.855 --> 01:20:18.204
How many of these calls
did you make?

01:20:18.378 --> 01:20:19.249
Just one.

01:20:19.727 --> 01:20:21.120
I give you everything!

01:20:22.469 --> 01:20:24.166
I am the master!
I am the teacher!

01:20:24.645 --> 01:20:26.038
I give, and give, and give!

01:20:26.865 --> 01:20:28.736
And you betray me
with your phone calls.

01:20:30.085 --> 01:20:32.001
He was trying to protect you.

01:20:32.915 --> 01:20:34.307
Protect Dalí?

01:20:34.699 --> 01:20:35.874
Ridiculous!

01:20:37.049 --> 01:20:38.921
And you, Amanda,
are you with him?

01:20:39.835 --> 01:20:42.750
I always knew
you'd be a traitor in the end.

01:20:43.708 --> 01:20:46.276
Dalí, there are bad things
going on around you.

01:20:46.450 --> 01:20:48.278
In the sale of your work,
the prints.

01:20:48.452 --> 01:20:50.323
All lies. You must apologize.

01:20:51.759 --> 01:20:52.804
No.

01:20:52.978 --> 01:20:54.675
- Apologize.
- James: No.

01:20:55.502 --> 01:20:57.026
I'm just trying
to tell you the truth.

01:21:02.335 --> 01:21:03.859
It was one painting.

01:21:05.512 --> 01:21:08.514
Jeff needs money
for his music and his demos.

01:21:08.689 --> 01:21:10.169
What is "demos"?

01:21:10.474 --> 01:21:11.779
I don't care, he's nothing.

01:21:11.954 --> 01:21:14.391
You,
everyone's kissing your feet,

01:21:14.565 --> 01:21:15.782
running to your parties.

01:21:15.958 --> 01:21:17.089
What do I do?

01:21:17.481 --> 01:21:20.571
I bring you coffee,
I cut your toenails.

01:21:21.702 --> 01:21:23.748
Jeff needs me.

01:21:23.922 --> 01:21:27.317
I do need you, my Olivina.

01:21:28.448 --> 01:21:29.536
This is insanity.

01:21:30.755 --> 01:21:32.757
I do need you. I do.

01:21:32.931 --> 01:21:34.280
You say this...

01:21:35.585 --> 01:21:37.414
but Jeff is young.

01:21:39.155 --> 01:21:41.070
He has all his future.

01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:44.160
I help him to be great.

01:21:44.725 --> 01:21:46.031
[breathes heavily]

01:21:46.205 --> 01:21:48.251
- And you have Amanda.
- Me?

01:21:49.165 --> 01:21:51.689
I spend nothing on Amanda!

01:21:52.124 --> 01:21:55.562
And here, like a school girl,
you throw my paintings at him,

01:21:55.736 --> 01:21:57.173
and he just takes money,
money, money!

01:21:57.347 --> 01:21:58.914
You're a jealous old man!

01:22:00.002 --> 01:22:01.612
You have no gift for music.

01:22:01.786 --> 01:22:03.614
You cannot play guitar
like Jeff.

01:22:03.788 --> 01:22:05.964
[groans]

01:22:06.791 --> 01:22:08.487
- Gala: Stop!
- [groans]

01:22:08.662 --> 01:22:10.360
- Gala: Stop it!
- But you know

01:22:10.534 --> 01:22:12.405
- how I love this painting.
- You've done others better.

01:22:12.579 --> 01:22:13.493
Much better.

01:22:13.666 --> 01:22:14.886
I never liked that painting.

01:22:15.452 --> 01:22:18.063
- [grunts]
- [groans]

01:22:22.371 --> 01:22:24.460
[whimpers]

01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:27.768
- Dalí: Rosa!
- [groans]

01:22:29.335 --> 01:22:31.684
[speaks in Spanish]

01:22:31.859 --> 01:22:36.212
[whimpers]

01:22:36.516 --> 01:22:39.344
[birds chirping]

01:23:13.466 --> 01:23:14.641
[spits]

01:23:17.688 --> 01:23:18.862
[exhales sharply]

01:23:19.385 --> 01:23:22.954
[in English] Never again
will I see you in this life.

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:31.876
[somber music playing]

01:24:20.532 --> 01:24:21.752
[music fades]

01:24:23.971 --> 01:24:26.713
[train rumbling]

01:24:31.630 --> 01:24:33.546
[lively music playing]

01:24:33.719 --> 01:24:35.026
Conductor:
[in Catalan, through speakers]

01:24:41.163 --> 01:24:43.295
[seagulls squawking]

01:24:49.300 --> 01:24:51.737
[indistinct announcement
over PA]

01:24:57.788 --> 01:25:00.007
Ja... James?

01:25:05.665 --> 01:25:07.406
They won't let me in to see him.

01:25:08.538 --> 01:25:10.844
- James: But he loves you.
- Just fucking vanity.

01:25:12.411 --> 01:25:14.457
He doesn't want anyone
to see him like this.

01:25:14.892 --> 01:25:16.023
With his burns?

01:25:16.763 --> 01:25:18.635
He thinks he's old and ugly.

01:25:21.638 --> 01:25:24.467
He doesn't paint.
He barely eats.

01:25:24.989 --> 01:25:28.210
Ever since Gala died,
it's like he's lost himself.

01:25:28.558 --> 01:25:29.776
[somber music playing]

01:25:30.690 --> 01:25:33.780
Amanda: She died
three years ago in Portlligat.

01:25:35.869 --> 01:25:37.741
She always said
she wanted to be buried

01:25:37.915 --> 01:25:39.438
at her castle in Púbol.

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:42.353
But the local authorities
would only allow that

01:25:42.528 --> 01:25:43.834
if she died there.

01:25:44.008 --> 01:25:46.402
So, they dressed up her body

01:25:46.924 --> 01:25:48.752
and drove her
back to her castle

01:25:48.925 --> 01:25:50.536
as if she was still alive.

01:25:59.110 --> 01:26:00.285
[music fades]

01:26:00.459 --> 01:26:03.723
So, she was buried in Púbol.
[scoffs]

01:26:06.030 --> 01:26:07.945
Sorry, I have a train to catch.
I have a...

01:26:08.859 --> 01:26:10.165
show in Paris.

01:26:10.513 --> 01:26:11.818
That's right. I heard.

01:26:12.254 --> 01:26:13.690
You're a pop star now.

01:26:15.822 --> 01:26:16.606
[bell ringing]

01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:18.173
And you?

01:26:18.389 --> 01:26:20.740
I have my own gallery
in the East Village.

01:26:20.914 --> 01:26:22.960
It's small, but I love it.

01:26:23.134 --> 01:26:24.614
After all
that happened with Dalí,

01:26:24.788 --> 01:26:26.877
you still want
to work with artists?

01:26:27.050 --> 01:26:28.443
Maybe I'm a masochist.

01:26:29.619 --> 01:26:31.098
I guess I found my perversion.

01:26:31.577 --> 01:26:33.144
Dalí would be proud.

01:26:33.753 --> 01:26:34.841
[somber music playing]

01:26:41.544 --> 01:26:45.287
[indistinct announcement
over PA]

01:26:47.505 --> 01:26:49.639
No, this is not possible.

01:26:49.856 --> 01:26:52.119
Please. I... I used to work
for Dalí. If you would give him

01:26:52.294 --> 01:26:54.077
- my name...
- Doctor: I'm sorry, no.

01:26:54.644 --> 01:26:56.559
You don't understand
how important this is to me.

01:26:57.124 --> 01:26:59.692
[Doctor speaks in Spanish]

01:27:01.128 --> 01:27:02.608
[Nurse speaks in Spanish]

01:27:03.305 --> 01:27:06.612
[Doctor speaks in Spanish]

01:27:07.004 --> 01:27:08.179
[in English] Dalí.

01:27:08.701 --> 01:27:10.616
[Doctor and Nurse
speak in Spanish indistinctly]

01:27:11.182 --> 01:27:12.270
James: It's James.

01:27:13.706 --> 01:27:14.794
James Linton.

01:27:18.014 --> 01:27:19.234
I wanted to give you something.

01:27:22.585 --> 01:27:23.803
San Sebastian.

01:27:25.109 --> 01:27:26.502
[somber music playing]

01:27:32.725 --> 01:27:33.770
I took this,

01:27:34.858 --> 01:27:35.815
but it's yours.

01:27:36.773 --> 01:27:37.730
It's your name.

01:27:40.124 --> 01:27:41.255
You should have it back.

01:27:49.002 --> 01:27:51.962
So, there. You're lucky,
you have seen Dalí.

01:27:53.964 --> 01:27:55.008
He remembered me.

01:27:55.791 --> 01:27:56.835
Oh.

01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:59.404
He said, "San Sebastian."

01:28:00.100 --> 01:28:01.406
That was his name for me.

01:28:03.190 --> 01:28:04.409
This was a name Dalí used

01:28:04.583 --> 01:28:06.455
for many young men
over the years.

01:28:07.543 --> 01:28:09.414
I've known at least three
San Sebastians myself.

01:28:10.154 --> 01:28:11.721
Perhaps he remembered you.

01:28:25.038 --> 01:28:27.302
[somber music continues]

01:28:33.177 --> 01:28:34.787
[speaks in Spanish]

01:28:35.919 --> 01:28:36.920
Gracias.
