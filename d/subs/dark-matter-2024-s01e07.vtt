01:35.971 --> 01:37.014
Hey.

01:37.681 --> 01:38.765
Hey.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.441
What's that?

01:47.941 --> 01:50.277
Dinner. I thought I'd cook tonight.

02:18.388 --> 02:21.225
How long are you guys
gonna stay mad at me for?

02:23.602 --> 02:24.603
I'll get it.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.527
Hi, I'm Detective Mason.

02:32.736 --> 02:33.820
Your parents home?

02:38.075 --> 02:39.117
Thank you.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.454
Do you know why I'm here?

02:43.121 --> 02:44.373
- No.
- I don't. No.

02:45.249 --> 02:48.460
You both know Ryan Holder.

02:50.212 --> 02:51.547
Since college.

02:51.547 --> 02:52.756
Forever.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.008
Well, two days ago,

02:56.176 --> 03:00.597
his girlfriend, Mindy Stewart,
reported him missing.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.558
Missing?

03:03.642 --> 03:06.478
She hadn't heard from him in 12 hours.
She said that wasn't usual.

03:06.478 --> 03:08.939
Then he missed a dinner date
they had planned.

03:11.441 --> 03:14.069
When was the last time
either of you saw Mr. Holder?

03:17.739 --> 03:22.619
Yeah, I saw him-- It was five days ago.

03:23.203 --> 03:25.414
- Where did you see him?
- I saw him at his apartment.

03:27.875 --> 03:30.919
- How'd he seem?
- He seemed totally fine.

03:32.296 --> 03:33.672
Nothing out of the ordinary?

03:33.672 --> 03:35.966
No, I didn't-- I didn't notice anything.

03:38.010 --> 03:40.387
And you?
When was the last time you saw Mr. Holder?

03:40.387 --> 03:43.015
Yeah, I-- I saw him three days ago.

03:43.015 --> 03:44.141
Where?

03:44.141 --> 03:46.935
At the Village Tap. It's a bar.

03:46.935 --> 03:49.688
Yeah, we actually have CCTV footage
of the two of you there.

03:49.688 --> 03:51.106
Oh, well...

03:51.106 --> 03:56.945
It appears to be the last place
that anyone saw or heard from Mr. Holder.

03:58.488 --> 03:59.865
How'd he seem that night?

03:59.865 --> 04:02.159
Well, to be honest...

04:03.785 --> 04:04.995
not great.

04:04.995 --> 04:06.413
What makes you say that?

04:06.413 --> 04:10.083
The main thing, I noticed
he was drinking a lot that evening.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.418
Is that notable?

04:12.377 --> 04:15.839
Yeah. He's been sober since high school.

04:15.839 --> 04:17.216
Never seen him drink.

04:17.798 --> 04:19.510
Where'd you two go after the bar?

04:19.510 --> 04:20.969
I came home, and...

04:22.221 --> 04:23.889
God, I don't know where he went.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.230
Well, thank you very much.

04:32.147 --> 04:35.943
If you think of anything else,
my cell's on the back.

04:37.611 --> 04:38.612
Thank you.

04:39.363 --> 04:40.781
I'll see myself out.

04:53.752 --> 04:55.170
Will you come upstairs?

05:14.273 --> 05:15.941
This is why I went to Ryan.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.655
Where did you find this?

05:21.655 --> 05:24.032
I followed you to the storage unit.

05:25.492 --> 05:28.245
And I took one to Ryan to see
if he could tell me what it was.

05:31.748 --> 05:33.375
It's not what you think.

05:41.884 --> 05:45.220
This is an experimental compound
designed to shut down

05:45.220 --> 05:48.056
certain regions in the prefrontal cortex.

05:48.056 --> 05:49.516
For what purpose?

05:49.516 --> 05:53.270
So that I can observe macroscopic objects
while they're in superposition.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.106
Ryan built it for me.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.110
Why didn't he tell me?

06:00.110 --> 06:04.281
He's under an NDA.
Now, why didn't you confront me with it?

06:06.074 --> 06:09.786
'Cause I feel like we've become strangers,
and I hate it.

06:10.412 --> 06:11.830
And I'm scared.

06:15.584 --> 06:17.169
Are you using it?

06:18.045 --> 06:19.379
Don't lie to me.

06:20.756 --> 06:21.882
Yes.

06:23.550 --> 06:25.052
Is it affecting you?

06:27.638 --> 06:29.806
Well, the side effects are pretty intense.

06:31.683 --> 06:33.268
I want you to stop.

06:33.769 --> 06:34.770
Okay.

06:34.770 --> 06:36.813
- Can you stop?
- Yes.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.900
I will.

06:53.455 --> 06:55.207
And what's in the storage unit?

06:57.334 --> 06:58.794
A lot of stuff from--

07:00.003 --> 07:01.338
Just for my project.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.134
Well, it feels like you were hiding it.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.264
Because I was.

07:13.141 --> 07:17.104
I guess I felt guilty of wanting more,
doing more.

07:17.688 --> 07:18.897
So, yeah.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.292
Are you really sure
that we need to do this?

07:39.168 --> 07:42.254
I think it's a waste of two ampoules.

07:42.254 --> 07:44.715
A waste of an entire day.

07:44.715 --> 07:47.134
Listen, I know.

07:48.218 --> 07:51.054
But in all our testing,
the drug was found to be habit forming,

07:51.054 --> 07:54.391
and it was never evaluated
under this level of continuous use.

07:54.391 --> 07:58.896
We've been living like this--
In fight or flight for 29 days.

07:59.730 --> 08:01.023
We really need a break.

08:01.857 --> 08:03.817
We need something completely different.

08:04.526 --> 08:06.486
- Doctor's orders.
- Okay.

09:49.590 --> 09:51.508
Everybody gather around me,

09:51.508 --> 09:55.137
and let's get into our horseshoe
like we practiced.

09:56.471 --> 09:59.183
Okay. Who knows why we're here?

09:59.975 --> 10:00.976
Look.

10:00.976 --> 10:04.563
Now, do you remember what we celebrate
during cold-fusion week?

10:04.563 --> 10:06.857
When the first fusion reactor went online.

10:06.857 --> 10:08.567
Yes. Okay, are you ready to go inside?

10:08.567 --> 10:10.819
- Yes!
- Okay, follow me.

10:11.778 --> 10:13.405
Where have you brought us?

10:15.574 --> 10:16.950
I'm not sure.

10:17.659 --> 10:19.411
I didn't even describe the world.

10:20.662 --> 10:25.876
Focused on concepts I thought
would make a world worth experiencing.

10:25.876 --> 10:27.294
Such as?

10:28.712 --> 10:30.714
People agreeing on basic facts,

10:30.714 --> 10:34.676
technology that doesn't
destroy the environment or humanity.

10:36.470 --> 10:40.057
Mostly, I wrote about empathy.

10:48.607 --> 10:49.608
Hi.

10:50.359 --> 10:51.860
Two hot chocolates, please.

11:00.118 --> 11:01.703
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

11:07.417 --> 11:12.089
So, you wrote about the people,
not the things.

11:12.965 --> 11:15.968
Life's about who you share it with, right?

11:17.261 --> 11:18.470
Is it good?

11:19.304 --> 11:20.389
Yeah.

11:21.139 --> 11:22.683
I think the cup is edible.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.064
- Yeah.
- It's good, right?

11:40.117 --> 11:41.118
You got it!

11:42.369 --> 11:44.705
It's called the Spire.

11:44.705 --> 11:47.749
Top of the Obama Building.
Best in the city.

11:47.749 --> 11:50.836
My friend's the manager.
Tell her Sid sent you.

11:50.836 --> 11:52.087
Thank you.

11:52.713 --> 11:55.215
- I'm loving this Chicago.
- Yeah.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.178
Wait, what? Are we leaving?

11:59.178 --> 12:00.262
I'm leaving.

12:01.305 --> 12:03.807
It's a surprise. Meet me in two hours?

12:05.642 --> 12:08.353
Okay. Where?

12:09.021 --> 12:11.315
How about that restaurant?

12:12.608 --> 12:13.901
Okay.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.235
Good?

12:16.778 --> 12:18.030
Cool.

12:18.030 --> 12:20.782
Sorry. Bye.

12:25.704 --> 12:27.831
- Another one?
- Yeah.

12:28.457 --> 12:30.292
No, I wanna do it. I'm gonna do it.

12:30.292 --> 12:32.544
No, it's gonna be great.
It's gonna be great.

12:32.544 --> 12:35.339
- Hey. Hi.
- Hi.

12:36.089 --> 12:38.509
- Would you mind taking our photo?
- Sure.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.135
Thanks.

12:40.135 --> 12:42.804
- Just that little button right there.
- Oh, yeah.

12:42.804 --> 12:46.433
Is there a special occasion?

12:46.433 --> 12:48.018
Yeah, it's our anniversary.

12:49.144 --> 12:51.522
- Yay.
- Hope that's okay.

12:51.522 --> 12:54.149
- You guys both look very happy.
- Thank you.

12:54.149 --> 12:55.817
You and your partner too.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.737
I took a photo of you two.

12:58.737 --> 13:00.822
- He does this.
- Sorry.

13:01.323 --> 13:03.325
You were just too cute not to.

13:03.325 --> 13:04.910
How long you been together?

13:04.910 --> 13:06.245
Sorry?

13:11.625 --> 13:13.794
Yeah, not too long.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.253
Thank you.

14:02.509 --> 14:03.468
Wow.

14:03.969 --> 14:05.345
It's amazing.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.514
I feel extremely underdressed.

14:09.641 --> 14:10.934
That's for you.

14:18.609 --> 14:19.693
Okay.

14:21.153 --> 14:23.864
Guess I'll be right back.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.678
Hot. Very hot.

14:46.678 --> 14:50.516
Yeah, it's amazing what
a wash of the face can do.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.189
- Cheers.
- Yeah.

15:01.610 --> 15:03.237
I got something for you.

15:03.237 --> 15:04.780
Close your eyes.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.536
All right. Open.

15:15.999 --> 15:17.042
Where?

15:17.042 --> 15:21.505
I saw them in a storefront in a bodega
as I was wandering around.

15:22.714 --> 15:25.467
- You remembered.
- Yeah.

15:25.467 --> 15:26.844
Thank you.

15:30.681 --> 15:31.682
Yeah.

15:31.682 --> 15:33.642
- You did?
- I had to.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.144
- And?
- You're not a scientist.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.146
What am I?

15:38.689 --> 15:40.107
You sell insurance.

15:42.943 --> 15:46.530
That is boring.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.491
I also looked me up.

15:51.952 --> 15:55.664
The Amanda Lucas of this world
went missing two years ago.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.709
Like me, she was born in Seattle,

15:58.709 --> 16:01.128
which is now part
of a country called Cascadia.

16:03.130 --> 16:07.176
Like me, she grew up mostly in SÃ£o Paulo
and moved to Chicago when she was 17.

16:07.885 --> 16:09.803
She has multiple citizenships.

16:09.803 --> 16:15.184
Unlike me, her parents are gone
and she never had a brother.

16:16.560 --> 16:17.853
Wow.

16:17.853 --> 16:19.188
So it's...

16:22.524 --> 16:23.567
it's perfect.

16:28.238 --> 16:33.535
Using facial recognition
and a retinal scan,

16:35.329 --> 16:38.248
I was able to get a new passport
in ten minutes.

16:39.541 --> 16:41.793
This Amanda has really good credit.

16:42.336 --> 16:44.880
All right,
what the fuck are you talking about?

16:50.093 --> 16:51.345
I'm staying.

16:52.387 --> 16:54.056
I can't keep doing this.

16:56.433 --> 16:58.393
I think you see it too.

16:59.895 --> 17:04.733
You have a home you're looking for,
but I don't have that.

17:05.526 --> 17:07.486
I can't go back to my world.

17:08.862 --> 17:13.867
I'm completely alone except for you.

17:15.577 --> 17:17.538
And you're not even my Jason.

17:19.623 --> 17:21.333
So you're abandoning me?

17:22.709 --> 17:23.877
Jason.

17:29.299 --> 17:30.884
I want you to stay.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.064
Yeah.

17:53.156 --> 17:57.286
I mean, I know that there are
countless worlds with Jasons

17:57.286 --> 18:00.539
that are much smarter than me
that would love to stay.

18:03.292 --> 18:08.130
And I'm sorry that I--
I just can't be one of them.

18:10.465 --> 18:12.134
As much as...

18:28.192 --> 18:31.153
At least I should leave you some ampoules.

18:31.153 --> 18:32.696
- Why?
- Why?

18:32.696 --> 18:35.115
We don't know that this is gonna work.

18:36.200 --> 18:37.993
No world can be perfect,

18:40.162 --> 18:44.124
but we have to choose
to make our life as great as it can be.

18:48.504 --> 18:50.756
What are you gonna do?
Where are you gonna go?

18:50.756 --> 18:52.424
Move back to Seattle,

18:52.966 --> 18:54.968
where no one knows Amanda Lucas anymore.

18:55.969 --> 18:57.179
Start over.

18:57.179 --> 18:59.765
Thought it all through.
Are you sure about it?

19:02.184 --> 19:05.229
If consciousness
makes our connection to reality,

19:06.355 --> 19:08.815
then it's not only the consciousness
of the person

19:08.815 --> 19:10.609
who opens the door that matters.

19:11.443 --> 19:13.070
It's both our minds.

19:13.946 --> 19:17.366
What if I'm the thing that is keeping you
from connecting to your world,

19:17.908 --> 19:19.368
from getting back to them?

19:23.914 --> 19:25.165
You're amazing.

19:28.085 --> 19:29.670
And I'm sorry. It was me.

19:29.670 --> 19:32.297
- I pulled you into this. I--
- No. No.

19:32.297 --> 19:33.715
None of that.

19:34.842 --> 19:36.093
No regrets.

19:40.097 --> 19:41.640
No regrets.

20:26.602 --> 20:27.978
I hope you find them.

20:29.563 --> 20:30.606
Thank you.

23:25.322 --> 23:27.032
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi.

23:27.950 --> 23:28.951
<i>Hi.</i>

23:30.077 --> 23:31.662
<i>What number are you calling from?</i>

23:33.330 --> 23:35.082
My phone died.

23:35.082 --> 23:40.128
I just borrowed a phone from someone here.

23:40.128 --> 23:41.630
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

23:44.216 --> 23:49.096
Yeah, I was just calling
to see how your morning's going.

23:49.096 --> 23:52.224
Do you mean since I saw you an hour ago?

23:53.767 --> 23:55.060
Is everything okay?

23:56.478 --> 23:58.647
Yeah. Yeah.

24:00.858 --> 24:02.693
Just hit me that...

24:04.862 --> 24:07.573
I take so many moments
with you for granted.

24:10.742 --> 24:13.745
I get up in the morning,
I go about my day,

24:13.745 --> 24:16.999
but it just hit me with--

24:18.125 --> 24:21.211
with clarity that I just love you so much.

24:23.338 --> 24:25.841
And I just thought
I'd better tell you because...

24:28.260 --> 24:30.929
you just never know, you know?

24:30.929 --> 24:33.849
<i>How about I cancel our plans for tonight,</i>

24:33.849 --> 24:38.187
and I'll wear my sexiest sweatpants?

24:47.070 --> 24:48.447
I would really love that.

24:49.615 --> 24:53.035
Look, I got to go 'cause this

24:53.744 --> 24:55.954
Zoom with the investors is about to start.

24:57.122 --> 24:58.874
- Yeah. Okay.
- <i>Okay.</i>

24:59.708 --> 25:01.043
I love you, sweetheart.

25:01.043 --> 25:02.586
I'll see you tonight.

27:58.220 --> 27:59.471
Dad?

28:00.222 --> 28:01.557
Charlie?

28:01.557 --> 28:03.433
No. It's your other son.

28:06.895 --> 28:08.230
What are you doing?

28:12.776 --> 28:14.236
I couldn't sleep.

28:16.113 --> 28:19.324
So you got dressed in all black
and put your shoes on

28:19.324 --> 28:21.368
so you could stand
around your own kitchen?

28:22.077 --> 28:23.996
Well, I thought a walk might help.

28:26.039 --> 28:27.457
Well, don't let me keep you.

28:33.547 --> 28:35.174
I love you, kiddo.

28:40.095 --> 28:41.263
What?

28:43.348 --> 28:44.975
What's the matter?

28:45.517 --> 28:48.270
I know how much of a massive
disappointment I am to you.

28:50.105 --> 28:51.106
No.

28:52.733 --> 28:55.068
No, I could never.

28:55.903 --> 28:58.989
- What? What are you doing?
- Hey. What's the matter?

29:02.034 --> 29:03.202
Talk to me.

29:06.288 --> 29:07.789
What's going on with you?

29:10.083 --> 29:12.169
Dad, it's almost the anniversary.

29:14.838 --> 29:18.425
Keep thinking about Holly
and how unfair it all is.

29:21.053 --> 29:22.679
She could have made something of herself.

29:22.679 --> 29:24.848
Meanwhile,
my stupid ass is just failing trig.

29:24.848 --> 29:26.183
Hey.

29:28.018 --> 29:29.102
Max.

29:32.356 --> 29:33.524
Max.

29:39.571 --> 29:42.366
Life is not like that.

29:42.366 --> 29:46.036
- It's complicated. It's--
- That girl is dead.

29:47.746 --> 29:49.748
I have her heart. I live and she doesn't.

29:49.748 --> 29:53.710
Do you really think I need to be told
that life is fucking complicated?

29:54.795 --> 29:55.838
No.

29:57.673 --> 29:58.757
Fuck off.

30:00.551 --> 30:01.718
Max.

30:22.322 --> 30:23.574
How's your week been?

30:28.036 --> 30:29.037
Well,

30:30.539 --> 30:32.749
Daniela went behind my back,

30:33.959 --> 30:37.796
and she spoke to a good friend of mine
about me and about my work.

30:38.505 --> 30:41.300
About things that she really
should have come to me with.

30:42.301 --> 30:46.013
So I'm thinking about
just packing up and leaving.

30:46.763 --> 30:48.891
Do you think that
will solve your problems?

30:48.891 --> 30:51.101
Y-- Why do you have a problem

30:51.101 --> 30:53.854
with me removing myself
from a bad situation?

30:53.854 --> 30:55.647
I don't have a problem with that.

30:55.647 --> 31:00.527
But do you think it's possible that you
are actually running away from yourself,

31:01.570 --> 31:02.738
from who you really are?

31:04.615 --> 31:08.243
You know, I don't know a thing about you.

31:08.827 --> 31:10.120
We're not here to talk about me.

31:10.120 --> 31:12.206
Yeah, but how am I supposed to trust you?

31:13.165 --> 31:14.708
Come on, just one thing.

31:15.334 --> 31:16.710
Just one.

31:17.586 --> 31:18.712
No? Okay.

31:18.712 --> 31:21.298
Well, how about I tell you
something about yourself?

31:21.965 --> 31:24.718
Like, you have a sweet tooth.

31:24.718 --> 31:26.929
I keep candy on my desk.

31:26.929 --> 31:28.388
That's not a state secret.

31:28.388 --> 31:32.184
Yeah, but it says
that you like to be liked,

31:32.184 --> 31:34.019
that you're a nice person.

31:34.728 --> 31:38.815
And I think that psychology
most likely wasn't your first love.

31:39.608 --> 31:41.985
You're right. I had many loves.

31:41.985 --> 31:44.613
And you seem to me
to be the kind of person

31:44.613 --> 31:49.743
that tends to give up a lot of yourself
to help others, particularly men.

31:50.744 --> 31:54.206
And, no, no, no, you would never
walk away from a bad situation.

31:54.206 --> 31:58.752
In fact, I think that you had a parent
that needed to be cared for.

31:59.336 --> 32:00.337
Yeah.

32:00.337 --> 32:04.883
She needed you so much that that
is exactly the reason why you became

32:04.883 --> 32:08.762
the kind of person that needs to rescue
other people instead of helping yourself.

32:16.937 --> 32:18.522
I'd like you to leave.

32:24.027 --> 32:25.070
Now.

32:25.863 --> 32:26.864
Yeah.

32:41.044 --> 32:43.463
Hi, Jason. Sorry to bother you.

32:43.463 --> 32:46.133
I just had a couple questions,
happened to be in the neighborhood.

32:47.176 --> 32:48.177
Sit.

32:54.057 --> 32:56.852
We finally looked up Ryan Holder's
cell phone records.

32:57.603 --> 33:01.565
The last location before it went offline
was an industrial area in South Chicago.

33:03.400 --> 33:04.526
Okay.

33:05.819 --> 33:09.740
It appears he went there straight after
having drinks with you at the Village Tap.

33:10.365 --> 33:11.366
Right.

33:12.659 --> 33:15.370
Any idea what he might have
been doing in that part of town

33:15.370 --> 33:17.372
- in the middle of the night?
- No.

33:18.749 --> 33:20.209
You didn't go there with him?

33:21.293 --> 33:22.419
No.

33:23.337 --> 33:25.589
He didn't tell you
what he was doing out there?

33:25.589 --> 33:26.965
No.

33:28.425 --> 33:29.551
Okay.

33:33.472 --> 33:34.806
Okay.

33:42.564 --> 33:46.276
You know, there's not much in the way
of CCTV coverage in that part of town.

33:46.276 --> 33:50.197
But if I find anything interesting,
I'll be in touch.

34:35.158 --> 34:37.286
You actually said, "Fuck you, I quit?"

34:38.203 --> 34:40.873
- Life's too short.
- All right. All right.

34:41.581 --> 34:43.333
Hey, what was your boss's name?

34:44.126 --> 34:45.377
Alan.

34:47.087 --> 34:48.422
Here's to you, Alan.

34:48.964 --> 34:50.716
But eat a bag of dicks.

34:50.716 --> 34:54.803
Fuck you, Alan.

34:54.803 --> 34:57.723
Why? You got a asshole boss in your life?

34:59.224 --> 35:00.225
Yeah.

35:01.185 --> 35:02.477
You're looking at him.

35:04.605 --> 35:07.774
So, wait, what is this?
What is it that you do exactly?

35:07.774 --> 35:10.444
I own a garage. Loyalty Motors.
You probably heard of us.

35:11.862 --> 35:12.946
No?

35:12.946 --> 35:15.824
Service all the fancy hipsters
over in Logan Square.

35:15.824 --> 35:19.119
Did you always wanna own a garage?

35:19.745 --> 35:21.205
Actually,
if things had gone a little different,

35:21.205 --> 35:23.582
I might've ended up at UChicago with you.

35:24.708 --> 35:25.876
No shit.

35:27.503 --> 35:29.004
I know I don't look like it,

35:29.004 --> 35:31.507
but I was a pretty smart motherfucker
back in the day.

35:32.299 --> 35:34.676
I had a full academic scholarship
at UChicago.

35:35.719 --> 35:37.054
What happened?

35:37.763 --> 35:40.807
My dumbass got a DUI
the summer after my senior year.

35:43.018 --> 35:44.561
Was at a party for my buddy.

35:44.561 --> 35:48.106
We were wasted,
and so we flipped a coin and I lost.

35:48.857 --> 35:52.903
Then I drove
and we hit a checkpoint on the way home.

35:56.448 --> 35:58.033
Do you ever wonder...

35:58.033 --> 35:59.326
All the fucking time.

36:00.452 --> 36:02.037
Another round, boys?

36:02.037 --> 36:04.498
We probably should.

36:04.498 --> 36:06.250
I'm gonna have a whiskey.
You want a whiskey?

36:06.250 --> 36:07.501
Yeah.

36:08.794 --> 36:10.003
Thanks.

36:10.003 --> 36:12.464
You ever get the feeling
when you meet someone,

36:13.632 --> 36:15.509
you're sure you've met them before?

36:16.593 --> 36:17.928
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

36:19.388 --> 36:20.639
There you go, lads.

36:21.139 --> 36:22.474
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

39:14.229 --> 39:18.025
<i>The first time I see you
is at the garden party.</i>

39:20.110 --> 39:21.987
<i>And when your eyes meet mine,</i>

39:21.987 --> 39:28.785
<i>it feels like some piece of machinery
has just seized inside of my chest,</i>

39:28.785 --> 39:30.329
<i>like worlds colliding.</i>

39:32.372 --> 39:35.334
<i>I've always known,
on a purely intellectual level,</i>

39:35.334 --> 39:37.920
<i>that human separateness is an illusion.</i>

39:38.504 --> 39:40.130
<i>We're all made of the same thing:</i>

39:40.130 --> 39:44.301
<i>Blown-out pieces of matter
formed in the fires of dead stars.</i>

39:44.301 --> 39:46.929
<i>I've just never felt
that knowledge in my bones</i>

39:46.929 --> 39:49.264
<i>until this moment here with you.</i>

39:51.725 --> 39:54.102
<i>I only remember pieces of what was said,</i>

39:54.102 --> 39:58.190
<i>how you laughed,
how the wine stained your lips.</i>

39:58.190 --> 39:59.900
<i>And then you say to me,</i>

39:59.900 --> 40:02.653
<i>"I have a friend whose gallery
opening is tonight.</i>

40:02.653 --> 40:03.862
<i>Do you wanna come?"</i>

40:03.862 --> 40:07.491
<i>And I thought, "I'd go anywhere with you."</i>

40:23.173 --> 40:26.927
<i>I'm leaving a world today
where our boy made it.</i>

40:27.594 --> 40:29.096
<i>Where Max is alive.</i>

40:30.222 --> 40:33.767
<i>I almost took that Jason's life
the same way mine was taken.</i>

40:34.393 --> 40:36.103
<i>But I realize something.</i>

40:36.103 --> 40:40.607
<i>I need my life and my family,
no one else's.</i>

40:44.528 --> 40:45.988
"I used to think that...

40:48.323 --> 40:51.743
life was about reaching
some perfect destination.

40:53.412 --> 40:56.623
Because I hadn't reached it yet,
I felt somehow ill at ease.

40:58.542 --> 41:00.419
But I had seen the perfection.

41:02.171 --> 41:06.425
I had reached it,
and I'm starting to suspect

41:07.676 --> 41:14.308
that it is the imperfections of life that
amount to a different kind of perfection."

41:18.937 --> 41:20.606
"I just wanna be home...

41:23.358 --> 41:24.693
back on the journey...

41:26.737 --> 41:28.280
with this version of you."

43:01.623 --> 43:03.208
Well, how can I help you, sir?

43:05.335 --> 43:06.420
You know me?

43:07.671 --> 43:09.256
Yes, Jason, I know you.

43:10.299 --> 43:11.967
- Okay.
- Oh, Matt.

43:11.967 --> 43:13.051
What do--

43:14.678 --> 43:17.639
- What are you drinking? What's going on?
- No, not tonight, man.

43:18.599 --> 43:19.850
Not tonight!

43:20.559 --> 43:22.519
Swung in for a hug. Okay. Thanks.

44:51.191 --> 44:52.234
Hey.

44:55.904 --> 44:58.907
Hey. Wow. That looks good. Hey.

45:00.534 --> 45:03.912
Sorry. Ryan finally called.

45:07.708 --> 45:10.460
I went and picked him up in a bar in Gary,

45:11.086 --> 45:12.588
and he was on a massive bender.

45:12.588 --> 45:13.922
Is he okay?

45:15.591 --> 45:17.509
Well, he's-- No.

45:18.010 --> 45:19.595
He's in a pretty bad way.

45:22.306 --> 45:24.099
He's going through some stuff.

45:25.017 --> 45:26.101
Where is he now?

45:27.269 --> 45:29.688
He's at home, sleeping it off. He's...

45:30.480 --> 45:32.274
Maybe he shouldn't be alone.

45:33.275 --> 45:36.195
I called Mindy. She's on her way.

45:36.195 --> 45:37.279
Good.

45:37.279 --> 45:39.907
And I gotta call Detective Mason.

45:40.574 --> 45:42.367
Just to, you know, let her know.

45:45.204 --> 45:47.414
Hey, why don't you text me Mindy's number?

45:48.207 --> 45:50.834
- I'll check on her.
- Yeah. Yeah.

46:05.682 --> 46:07.851
Hi. Help you with something?

46:07.851 --> 46:10.812
- Yeah. I wanna buy a handgun.
- Okay.

46:11.438 --> 46:13.273
Don't really know
the first thing about them.

46:13.857 --> 46:15.817
No worries. The purpose would be?

46:17.611 --> 46:19.404
- Just home defense.
- Okay.

46:20.989 --> 46:25.118
So, we've got this Glock 23 right here.

46:25.953 --> 46:28.872
It's a .40 caliber.
Austrian-made, solid knockdown power.

46:28.872 --> 46:30.791
Now, I can get you in a subcompact version

46:30.791 --> 46:33.377
if you want something a little smaller
for a concealed carry permit.

46:33.377 --> 46:35.462
So, that would take down an intruder?

46:35.462 --> 46:38.006
Oh, yeah. Yeah, this will put 'em down.

46:38.507 --> 46:39.925
Won't be getting up either.

46:40.801 --> 46:43.262
Is that-- Can I-- Is it--
How many bullets does it--

46:43.262 --> 46:45.430
- It's rounds. Thirteen. Yeah.
- Rounds?

46:49.226 --> 46:50.435
You got it.

46:51.436 --> 46:53.355
- Yeah, what do you think?
- Yeah.

46:53.355 --> 46:55.732
- Well, it feels like a gun.
- Yeah.

46:55.732 --> 46:57.276
All right.
Well, I can show you a few more.

46:57.276 --> 47:00.654
I've got a really nice Smith & Wesson .357
if you want a revolver instead.

47:00.654 --> 47:03.448
No. It-- That's perfect. And I'll take it.

47:03.448 --> 47:06.118
Yeah? Okay, great.
You got your FOID card?

47:07.661 --> 47:09.037
What is that?

47:09.037 --> 47:13.083
It's your Firearm Owners Identification
card issued by the Illinois State Police.

47:16.086 --> 47:17.671
And how do I get one?

47:17.671 --> 47:19.715
You have to apply for it.

47:23.677 --> 47:24.678
Okay.

47:25.512 --> 47:26.722
Okay.

47:27.931 --> 47:29.057
In the meantime,

47:31.018 --> 47:35.063
have you got anything
like pepper spray, or mace?

47:35.063 --> 47:37.274
- Yeah, sure do, right over here.
- Yeah?

47:38.275 --> 47:42.571
I recommend the Fox Labs pepper spray.
It's got 5.3 million Scoville Heat Units.

47:42.571 --> 47:44.198
It's the hottest and
strongest on the market.

47:44.198 --> 47:46.033
- All right, great. Yeah. I'll do that.
- Yeah?

47:46.033 --> 47:48.702
- And can I have a look at a knife?
- Yeah, right here.

47:49.745 --> 47:51.872
You looking for anything
in particular, or...

47:52.539 --> 47:55.375
- I mean, no. This one?
- That's a good choice.

47:55.375 --> 47:58.045
This is the Spyderco Civilian.

47:58.045 --> 48:00.464
Designed for self-defense
and hand-to-hand combat.

48:01.048 --> 48:02.257
Just be careful.

48:03.258 --> 48:05.886
- Yeah. I'll take both.
- Okay.

48:05.886 --> 48:06.970
Great.

48:07.513 --> 48:09.473
I will ring you up right over there.

48:10.098 --> 48:12.100
- Appreciate your business. Yep.
- Thank you.

48:12.100 --> 48:13.977
- Have a good one.
- Yeah.

48:33.455 --> 48:35.666
Did you change your mind about the knife?

48:37.209 --> 48:39.711
I wanted to buy a handgun.

48:39.711 --> 48:43.298
I just don't really know
the first thing about them.

48:44.758 --> 48:46.552
Didn't we just have this conversation?

48:48.345 --> 48:49.847
What are you talking about?

48:50.973 --> 48:52.474
We just did this.

48:52.474 --> 48:54.726
I showed you a Glock.
You didn't have your FOID card.

48:56.228 --> 48:58.939
You bought mace and a knife?

48:58.939 --> 49:01.358
No, I've never been in this store.

49:06.113 --> 49:10.075
Okay. Yeah. Do you have a twin?

49:12.911 --> 49:14.079
No.

49:15.581 --> 49:19.751
Are you saying that someone was just
in here that looks a lot like me?

49:21.044 --> 49:22.963
Yeah. Yeah, exactly like you.

49:22.963 --> 49:25.007
Same clothes and every-- Well, he didn't--

49:25.924 --> 49:27.885
He didn't have a brace on his finger.

49:28.719 --> 49:30.387
How long ago was that?

49:31.138 --> 49:33.473
He walked out 20 seconds
before you walked in.

49:37.936 --> 49:39.730
Hey, do you know which direction he went?

49:39.730 --> 49:41.064
I didn't see.

49:41.064 --> 49:43.233
You wanna tell me
what the hell's going on?
