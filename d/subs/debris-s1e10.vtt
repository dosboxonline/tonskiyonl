00:04.629 --> 00:06.423
<i>MALE NARRATOR:</i>
<i>Previously on Debris...</i>

00:06.464 --> 00:08.550
They were forcing me
to build a device

00:08.591 --> 00:11.553
that would track a very
dangerous piece of Debris.

00:11.594 --> 00:13.513
BRYAN: We’re gonna get George
the equipment he needs.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.724
FINOLA: We have to get
to Washington State on a case.

00:15.765 --> 00:17.726
Maddox cannot suspect anything.

00:17.767 --> 00:20.437
SHELBY: I know that’s part
of a crashed alien ship.

00:20.478 --> 00:22.480
BRYAN: How do you know that?

00:22.522 --> 00:25.025
SHELBY: It transported us
into the past.

00:25.066 --> 00:26.359
It’s not just time travel.

00:26.401 --> 00:27.694
BRYAN: What did you do?

00:27.736 --> 00:29.904
My sister’s gone.
I have to get her back.

00:29.946 --> 00:33.408
GEORGE: These repeated jumps
can cause irreversible damage.

00:33.450 --> 00:34.743
BRYAN:
I have this under control.

00:34.784 --> 00:37.203
GRACE:
We have a problem with Bryan.

00:37.245 --> 00:39.497
Don’t let him trigger it again,
whatever the cost.

00:39.539 --> 00:42.667
The Debris,
it may be reading your desires.

00:42.709 --> 00:45.170
Who’s the person that you’re
trying to get back to?

00:45.211 --> 00:46.755
BRYAN: You.

00:49.257 --> 00:52.052
-Where is she?
-I don’t know.

00:52.093 --> 00:53.720
We have to move quickly.

00:56.181 --> 00:57.515
I’m sorry I did this to you.

00:57.557 --> 01:00.560
It’s not your fault.
It’s mine.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.103
What do you mean?

01:02.145 --> 01:03.605
George said that you were
a pilot--

01:03.646 --> 01:06.566
a pilot that needs
his direction clear.

01:06.608 --> 01:09.194
I realize that I am a pilot
in this too.

01:09.235 --> 01:10.987
We’re here because
I put us off course.

01:11.029 --> 01:13.615
You want one thing,

01:13.656 --> 01:15.367
maybe you even believe
that you want it,

01:15.408 --> 01:18.370
but deep down inside,
you want something else.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.330
George said something
like that.

01:20.372 --> 01:25.251
And I’m not being honest
with what I want.

01:25.293 --> 01:27.629
Do you think it’ll work now?

01:31.132 --> 01:32.634
BRYAN: We have to go.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.804
-(helicopter whirring)
-Follow me.

01:51.194 --> 01:53.488
Bryan! Don’t do it!

02:30.775 --> 02:34.821
I love Washington.
I spent a lot of time here.

02:34.863 --> 02:38.992
Do you know the first food
astronauts ate in space?

02:39.034 --> 02:41.661
No.

02:41.703 --> 02:43.997
-No, I don’t.
-Applesauce...

02:44.039 --> 02:46.666
in a tube like toothpaste.

02:46.708 --> 02:50.670
Sixty-eight percent
of the apples we eat
are grown in Washington.

02:52.672 --> 02:54.507
Looks like we’re here.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.687
-Picking up on something.
-(device scanning)

03:07.729 --> 03:10.982
Not much. But there is
definitely something here.

03:12.650 --> 03:14.611
Maybe someone over at that house
knows something.

03:18.156 --> 03:20.533
(door closes)

03:20.575 --> 03:22.577
Hey, why don’t you run
the tests,

03:22.619 --> 03:24.537
and I’ll check it out?

03:24.579 --> 03:26.831
Okay.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.083
(chuckles)

03:28.124 --> 03:30.335
-(bell chimes)
-(muttering)

03:43.932 --> 03:45.809
Can I help you?

03:45.850 --> 03:47.894
Uh...

03:47.936 --> 03:49.521
You’re back.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.940
You’re Kathleen, right?

03:51.981 --> 03:54.067
How do you know my name?

03:54.109 --> 03:56.319
I’m a friend of Shelby’s.
Is he here?

03:57.612 --> 03:59.239
How do you know my brother?

03:59.280 --> 04:00.532
I know what you’re doing.

04:00.573 --> 04:03.159
I know what you found
in the sea.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.703
Who told you?

04:04.744 --> 04:07.330
-Who are you?
-Is he here?

04:08.873 --> 04:12.210
Hey, it’s okay.
Is-- Is Shelby here?

04:12.252 --> 04:14.754
It made him disappear.

04:16.423 --> 04:17.590
What?

04:18.550 --> 04:20.343
(stammering)
When did that happen?

04:20.385 --> 04:21.761
KATHERINE:
A few days ago.

04:21.803 --> 04:25.765
-We went out to it, and when--
-Yeah.

04:25.807 --> 04:28.435
When I got back, he was gone.

04:29.978 --> 04:32.105
It’s like he was erased.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.815
Like he was never born.

04:36.901 --> 04:39.863
I was too afraid
to go back out there.

04:39.904 --> 04:43.867
My name is Bryan Beneventi.
I’m with a government agency.

04:43.908 --> 04:48.580
I came here to investigate
what you found in the water
with my partner.

04:48.621 --> 04:53.251
And then she disappeared

04:53.293 --> 04:55.295
like your brother.

04:55.337 --> 04:58.882
I just wanna get back to her
in the same way your brother
wants to get back to you.

04:58.923 --> 05:01.551
Wait. How do you know
he’s trying to get back to me?

05:03.136 --> 05:05.680
Because I was just with him.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.021
* (theme)

05:46.471 --> 05:48.390
(electricity crackling)

05:55.647 --> 05:58.191
I don’t understand.
If you jumped with Shelby,

05:58.233 --> 06:00.443
why is he not back here too?

06:00.485 --> 06:03.154
Listen to me right now.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.950
There is an agent right here
whose one goal is to take
this Debris away.

06:06.991 --> 06:08.910
-Why?
-Because he’s not from here.

06:08.952 --> 06:11.579
To them it is just
an extra-terrestrial graph.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.915
They don’t care.
And in two minutes,

06:13.957 --> 06:16.042
she’s going to figure out
that it’s in the water,

06:16.084 --> 06:18.837
and this whole place
is gonna be crawling
with people just like her.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.380
If that happens, you’re never
gonna see your brother again.

06:20.422 --> 06:22.215
I’m never gonna see
my partner again.

06:22.257 --> 06:24.175
Why don’t we go back
to the wreck and use it now?

06:24.217 --> 06:25.760
We can find them.

06:25.802 --> 06:27.721
What Shelby and I tried
didn’t work.

06:27.762 --> 06:29.848
We need to figure out
what went wrong first,

06:29.889 --> 06:31.933
or we’re to end up doing
damage to the universe.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.564
Bryan?

06:37.605 --> 06:39.733
It’s already started.

06:39.774 --> 06:42.610
What are you talking about?

06:49.951 --> 06:54.664
I’ve seen this degradation
before.

06:54.706 --> 06:57.250
But now it’s dire.

06:57.292 --> 07:02.380
This is happening in every
reality that I’ve been to.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.133
We can’t outrun it.
It’s just going to continue.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.976
All realities will bleed
into each other.

07:20.648 --> 07:23.151
And the universe will
collapse in on itself.

07:25.278 --> 07:28.239
These people that we’re seeing,

07:28.281 --> 07:31.576
they’re in another reality,

07:31.618 --> 07:33.870
bleeding through.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.918
I think we might have caused it.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.044
How?

07:43.129 --> 07:46.508
Shelby initially said that
the only way to stop
the degradation,

07:46.549 --> 07:49.010
to fix it,

07:49.052 --> 07:51.304
was to get him back to his
own reality, but he lied.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.807
My brother isn’t a liar.

07:55.100 --> 07:56.935
He only lied

07:56.976 --> 08:00.438
because he knew we would take
the Debris away if he didn’t.

08:00.480 --> 08:04.109
He wanted to get back
to you so badly...

08:04.150 --> 08:06.236
just like I want to get
to somebody.

08:07.487 --> 08:11.199
My partner... Finola.

08:17.539 --> 08:18.873
What do we do?

08:18.915 --> 08:21.459
We need to find George Jones.

08:21.501 --> 08:22.919
Who is that?

08:25.714 --> 08:27.882
My partner’s father
is a a scientist

08:27.924 --> 08:29.509
who is helping Shelby
and I try to figure it out.

08:29.551 --> 08:31.052
He’s the only one that I know

08:31.094 --> 08:33.680
who can find a way to unravel
these realities

08:33.722 --> 08:35.765
and get us back to where
we’re supposed to be.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.226
Bryan?

08:43.106 --> 08:45.150
GRACE: Why are you still
in here, Bryan?

08:45.191 --> 08:48.028
This is happening
all over the house.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.822
We have to leave until
the Situation Team gets here.

08:50.864 --> 08:53.074
-It’s okay.
-It’s not okay.

08:53.116 --> 08:55.827
Bryan, we shouldn’t even be
in here without suits.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.203
She shouldn’t be in here at all.

08:57.245 --> 09:00.373
Let’s just wait to call
a team, okay?

09:00.415 --> 09:02.042
I already called in the team.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.085
The signatures out there
are rising by the minute.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.589
I’ve got this under control.

09:07.630 --> 09:09.716
Bryan, I have known you
for five years.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.343
You do not have this
under control.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.553
We don’t even know
how far out this piece

09:13.595 --> 09:15.055
-is affecting its surroundings.
-I know.

09:15.096 --> 09:17.057
It is much worse
than we initially thought.

09:17.098 --> 09:19.392
I just need some time to think.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.895
Bryan, are you seeing
what’s happening here.

09:21.936 --> 09:24.981
We need to find the Debris
and neutralize it immediately.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.569
The Debris is in the ocean.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.071
How do you know that?

09:31.112 --> 09:31.946
I just know.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.574
What are you talking about?

09:34.616 --> 09:38.244
I understand that you don’t know
what’s going on here, Grace.

09:38.286 --> 09:40.246
But I am desperate
for that Debris

09:40.288 --> 09:43.083
to stay exactly where it is
for enough time

09:43.124 --> 09:46.419
for me to figure out
how to fix this.

09:46.461 --> 09:48.713
Bryan, I trust you,

09:48.755 --> 09:51.007
but you are making
no sense at all.

09:51.049 --> 09:53.218
If you really know where
this Debris is,

09:53.259 --> 09:56.304
we have to stop this.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.765
We need to find George Jones.

09:58.807 --> 10:00.850
He’s the only one
that can stop it.

10:02.977 --> 10:06.022
Bryan, George Jones is dead.

10:08.233 --> 10:11.653
You just killed him
at the INFLUX compound
two days ago.

10:11.695 --> 10:15.365
-Remember?
-What?

10:16.741 --> 10:18.702
-What is she doing?
-Kathleen!

10:18.743 --> 10:19.994
No!

10:27.210 --> 10:28.920
(gasps)

11:13.214 --> 11:14.924
FINOLA: The first disturbances
were picked up

11:14.966 --> 11:17.469
in the atmosphere yesterday,
8:20 A.M.

11:17.510 --> 11:19.220
GIBSON: They pick up anything
falling?

11:19.262 --> 11:20.722
FINOLA: No.

11:21.848 --> 11:24.517
-Damn it.
-What?

11:24.559 --> 11:25.852
Denied.

11:25.894 --> 11:28.521
What do you mean?
Why are you denied?

11:28.563 --> 11:31.983
Back in the 1958, GM offered
each of the Mercury astronauts

11:32.025 --> 11:33.985
a Chevy for one dollar
per year.

11:34.027 --> 11:36.821
That’s why you see all those
photos of them with their
Corvettes.

11:36.863 --> 11:40.158
-Really? Just a dollar?
-Yeah.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.951
-Huh.
-They scrapped the program,
though,

11:41.993 --> 11:44.037
but I’ve been trying to convince
them to bring it back.

11:45.246 --> 11:49.125
Why? We don’t work
for NASA, Gibson.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.419
Close enough.
But why are you on their side?

11:51.461 --> 11:53.463
I’m not on their side.
I’m just saying that, you know,

11:53.505 --> 11:56.049
they go into actual space.

11:56.091 --> 11:59.094
-We should be on cereal boxes.
-Okay, okay.

11:59.135 --> 12:03.932
You get a cereal box.
Honey Nut Malcontent.

12:05.767 --> 12:08.436
-I need a new partner.
-Yep. Tell me about it.

12:08.478 --> 12:10.397
Uh, SAT scans.

12:10.438 --> 12:13.233
Pull up over there.

12:19.781 --> 12:22.075
I hate the ocean.

12:22.117 --> 12:25.620
-(device scanning)
-You get anything?

12:25.662 --> 12:28.331
Yeah, a bit.

12:28.373 --> 12:30.250
There’s definitely
something out there.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.501
Call it in.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.965
Yeah, it’s Gibson.

12:37.007 --> 12:39.801
We’re gonna need
a Situation Team
in Oceanside right away.

12:54.816 --> 12:56.151
(bell chimes)

12:59.821 --> 13:02.282
Agent Gibson,
and this is Agent Jones.

13:02.323 --> 13:06.161
We’re from the government,
and we’d like to ask you
a few questions.

13:06.202 --> 13:08.204
-KATHLEEN: Okay.
-Are your parents home?

13:08.246 --> 13:12.208
No. No, they’re traveling
in Europe.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.961
Okay. And do you have any idea
when they’ll be home?

13:15.003 --> 13:18.715
-Did he say your name was Jones?
-Uh, yeah.

13:18.757 --> 13:21.926
Was your father a scientist
named George Jones?

13:23.428 --> 13:26.765
Uh, was? No.
George Jones is my father.

13:26.806 --> 13:30.101
He’s not dead?

13:30.143 --> 13:35.231
No, he’s, um...
very much alive and well.

13:35.273 --> 13:38.401
Can you reach him?
Can-- Can you reach your father?

13:38.443 --> 13:42.405
What is this about?
How do you know my father?

13:42.447 --> 13:45.200
George Jones is the only one
who can save the world.

13:56.294 --> 13:58.088
How long have these been here?

13:58.129 --> 14:01.091
They started after my brother
disappeared.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.093
At least that’s what
the agent said.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.638
And what was his name?

14:06.680 --> 14:09.766
Bryan. Bryan Beneventi.

14:09.808 --> 14:11.267
(whispers)
Bryan Beneventi.

14:13.228 --> 14:16.523
And he said he was, uh,
looking for me?

14:18.483 --> 14:22.404
He was looking for your father
to fix this.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.366
He wanted to get back to you,

14:26.408 --> 14:29.452
to another version of you
where my brother took him from.

14:29.494 --> 14:33.081
These jumps are putting
a cumulative strain

14:33.123 --> 14:36.167
on the fabric of space-time.

14:36.209 --> 14:39.629
Eventually, I mean,
this damage could be
irreversible.

14:39.671 --> 14:42.090
This is proof.

14:42.132 --> 14:43.842
GIBSON: Situation Team
is 15 minutes out.

14:43.883 --> 14:44.968
We should get her
out of the house.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.261
-Yeah.
-No.

14:47.429 --> 14:48.596
They’re gonna take it away.

14:48.638 --> 14:49.723
Kathleen, we have to.

14:49.764 --> 14:51.182
We have no idea
what this is doing.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.018
We’re going to have to study it.

14:54.644 --> 14:57.647
He told me that your father said
the universe would continue
to decay

14:57.689 --> 14:59.774
if I didn’t get back.

14:59.816 --> 15:03.319
He said it’s already in motion,
and you said so yourself.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.238
Look what’s happening.

15:05.280 --> 15:07.157
You have to find your father.

15:07.198 --> 15:09.284
He’s the only one
who could fix this.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.202
Bryan told me you wouldn’t
realize it.

15:15.206 --> 15:17.083
We can’t play around with this.

15:17.125 --> 15:18.585
You’ve got to call your father.

15:22.881 --> 15:25.175
That’s incredible.

15:25.216 --> 15:27.552
It’s like the Debris
is allowing her

15:27.594 --> 15:31.306
to shuffle between realities
like a deck of cards.

15:31.348 --> 15:33.683
Every time she uses the Debris,

15:33.725 --> 15:36.853
she plucks another card
from the deck.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.480
FINOLA: Yeah. Exactly.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.357
<i>GEORGE (on phone):</i>
<i>Tell me about this partner.</i>

15:40.398 --> 15:45.111
His name is Bryan Beneventi.

15:45.153 --> 15:49.657
She said he told her that
the longer that she’s away
from her reality,

15:49.699 --> 15:52.160
<i>the quicker the universe</i>
<i>will deteriorate.</i>

15:52.202 --> 15:56.956
Yeah, I suppose.
Hypothetically, in order

15:56.998 --> 15:59.459
<i>for Kathleen to return to her</i>
<i>original reality,</i>

15:59.501 --> 16:03.046
she would have to jump
at the exact same time

16:03.088 --> 16:07.926
<i>she and Shelby originally</i>
<i>activated the Debris.</i>

16:07.967 --> 16:10.804
Hmm.

16:10.845 --> 16:12.514
Yeah, but--

16:12.555 --> 16:15.433
<i>Something just doesn’t</i>
<i>sit right with me.</i>

16:15.475 --> 16:17.268
Why, what’s wrong?

16:17.310 --> 16:19.229
What this, um,
Belefonte said,

16:19.270 --> 16:20.730
it doesn’t doesn’t make
any sense.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.482
I mean, essentially,

16:22.524 --> 16:24.901
it’s the exact opposite
to what’s occurring right now.

16:24.943 --> 16:28.530
<i>And if the data set</i>
<i>from Gibson’s is accurate,</i>

16:28.571 --> 16:32.117
<i>well, you definitely should not</i>
<i>allow this girl to jump again.</i>

16:32.158 --> 16:34.411
<i>I’m absolutely sure of that.</i>

16:34.452 --> 16:37.414
<i>We’re already on shaky ground.</i>

16:37.455 --> 16:40.917
Is there any-- any truth
to what she is saying then?

16:40.959 --> 16:45.380
I believe that any jump is going
to destabilize the situation
further.

16:45.422 --> 16:48.633
<i>And, in fact, any more jumps</i>
<i>are going to--</i>

16:48.675 --> 16:53.430
<i>It’s gonna cause</i>
<i>irreversible damage.</i>

16:53.471 --> 16:56.683
She must accept
that her brother’s gone.

16:56.725 --> 16:59.102
<i>FINOLA: Okay. The Situation</i>
<i>Teams will be here soon.</i>

16:59.144 --> 17:01.479
All right. Be safe.

17:09.154 --> 17:10.405
FINOLA:
Where is Kathleen?

17:10.447 --> 17:12.949
Wasn’t she outside
with you?

17:12.991 --> 17:14.200
Kathleen.

17:14.242 --> 17:15.702
What do you think, Craig?

17:18.913 --> 17:21.958
-What?
-I knew that name ring a bell.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.711
You ready for this?

17:24.753 --> 17:29.257
Bryan Beneventi is
an actual person.

17:30.216 --> 17:31.801
He was a marine in Afghanistan.

17:31.843 --> 17:34.637
I was keeping my eye on him
back during the conflict.

17:34.679 --> 17:38.725
Well, in another reality,
it seems he works here.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.685
The guy was like
a trouble magnet.

17:40.727 --> 17:43.021
Like, I tried to talk to him,
help him out, give him a hand.

17:43.063 --> 17:44.939
He didn’t want to listen.

17:44.981 --> 17:46.274
Now we see how that turned out.

17:46.316 --> 17:47.567
He’s a war criminal.

17:50.278 --> 17:51.821
For the best,
I suppose.

18:10.215 --> 18:11.883
That’s my brother.

18:15.804 --> 18:20.392
That’s your partner... Bryan?

18:59.764 --> 19:04.644
The other people can’t see us,
but they did.

19:04.686 --> 19:07.313
They can’t be far, right?

19:07.355 --> 19:10.859
Because they saw us?

19:10.900 --> 19:12.944
He saw me.

19:12.986 --> 19:16.322
A reality close by.

19:16.364 --> 19:17.615
Kathleen.

19:20.952 --> 19:25.415
I can’t deny
what I just witnessed,

19:25.457 --> 19:28.043
but my father thinks
that the universe

19:28.084 --> 19:30.754
is in a state right now

19:30.795 --> 19:32.547
that cannot bear
the uncertainty

19:32.589 --> 19:34.549
of you visiting
the Debris again.

19:34.591 --> 19:36.718
What are you saying?

19:36.760 --> 19:38.428
I’m saying that you lied.

19:38.470 --> 19:42.098
What you told us about
my father was not true.

19:42.140 --> 19:44.976
Stopping the degradation’s
got nothing,

19:45.018 --> 19:47.604
nothing to do with you getting
back to your original reality.

19:47.645 --> 19:50.774
No, but you don’t understand me.

19:50.815 --> 19:52.942
-It’s my fault.
-It’s not your fault.

19:52.984 --> 19:55.278
-It is my fault. I insisted.
-It is not your fault.

19:55.320 --> 19:57.822
I encouraged him to keep doing
the jumps in the first place.

19:57.864 --> 19:59.783
After the first time,
he didn’t want to.

19:59.824 --> 20:01.743
I made him.

20:03.453 --> 20:04.829
And I have to fix this.

20:07.332 --> 20:08.500
Kathleen!

20:11.252 --> 20:12.754
Kathleen!

20:25.100 --> 20:26.601
Kathleen!

20:28.520 --> 20:29.979
Kathleen, no!

21:56.232 --> 21:58.026
Sorry.

22:18.546 --> 22:20.423
GRACE: Here’s a fun fact.

22:20.465 --> 22:23.385
Do you know the first food
astronauts ate in space?

22:23.426 --> 22:24.678
What?

22:24.719 --> 22:27.847
Applesauce in a tube,
like toothpaste.

22:27.889 --> 22:33.687
Sixty-eight percent
of the apples we eat are
grown here in Washington.

22:33.728 --> 22:35.271
Looks like we’re here.

22:43.947 --> 22:46.700
-It’s been a while since
I’ve seen the ocean.
-Hmm.

22:46.741 --> 22:50.954
-(device scanning)
-You get anything?

22:50.995 --> 22:53.331
Yeah, it’s clicking in high.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.917
So much worse than
the report suggested.

23:17.105 --> 23:19.607
-I’ll get set up out here.
-Yeah.

23:32.287 --> 23:37.083
Hey, we’re going to need
an emergency Situation
Team at this location.

23:38.126 --> 23:39.878
We’re seeing heavy degradation.

23:39.919 --> 23:41.588
I’m not sure what’s causing it.

23:41.629 --> 23:43.715
We’re about to go inside, okay?

23:45.717 --> 23:47.302
(doorbell chimes)

23:54.642 --> 23:56.436
My name is Agent Finola Jones.
I’m with the government.

23:56.478 --> 23:57.896
I’m going to need for you
to clear out the house.

23:57.937 --> 24:00.482
I know.
I know what’s happening.

24:00.523 --> 24:02.317
We don’t have much time.

24:04.194 --> 24:06.446
This isn’t the first time
you’ve been here.

24:06.488 --> 24:07.906
What are you talking about?

24:09.741 --> 24:11.451
There’s a piece of Debris
in sea.

24:11.493 --> 24:14.120
My brother and I used it
to jump into new realities.

24:14.162 --> 24:16.247
We were separated.
I’ve been trying
to get back to him,

24:16.289 --> 24:19.459
and how the universe
is breaking down.

24:19.501 --> 24:23.046
In one of these realities,
you have a partner named
Bryan Beneventi.

24:23.088 --> 24:24.714
Bryan’s with my brother,
Shelby,

24:24.756 --> 24:27.717
and they are trying to fix
the problems from where
they are.

24:27.759 --> 24:30.845
-What’s your name?
-Kathleen.

24:30.887 --> 24:32.722
Kathleen, how do you know
all of this?

24:34.557 --> 24:36.434
Because I spoke to them.

24:38.019 --> 24:40.021
They want to speak to you.

24:52.867 --> 24:54.244
That’s him.

24:54.285 --> 24:56.454
That’s my brother,
and that’s your partner.

25:14.764 --> 25:18.893
Bryan and Shelby have come
across a lot of different
versions of you and your father.

25:21.771 --> 25:25.275
He told me that many of those
Finolas were helping him find
an answer to this.

25:29.446 --> 25:31.114
"Bilateral deviation."

25:51.718 --> 25:53.303
Bilateral deviation

25:53.345 --> 25:55.847
Um... Do you have a pen?

25:55.889 --> 25:58.016
(sighs)
Bilateral deviation.

25:58.058 --> 25:59.184
No, I don’t know.

26:00.769 --> 26:02.062
(sighs)
Bilateral deviation.

26:06.566 --> 26:07.484
I don’t know.

26:14.699 --> 26:16.409
Why does he keep saying that?

26:16.451 --> 26:19.287
-Has he said this before?
-No.

27:26.730 --> 27:28.481
How?

27:30.608 --> 27:32.736
(sighs)
God, um...

27:32.777 --> 27:34.446
Okay, okay, um...

27:35.363 --> 27:37.365
Okay, uh...

27:37.407 --> 27:39.868
Okay, but...

27:42.370 --> 27:45.290
I can’t-- I don’t know.

27:53.757 --> 27:54.966
What was that?

27:55.008 --> 27:57.886
(Finola stammering)

27:59.512 --> 28:02.766
No, it’s still within range.
Hang on. Here’s Finola.

28:02.807 --> 28:04.142
The team’s two minutes out.

28:04.184 --> 28:07.187
Have you heard of, um,
bilateral deviation?

28:07.228 --> 28:08.897
-No. What is that?
-Okay.

28:08.938 --> 28:11.149
It just might be the key
to fixing all of this.

28:11.191 --> 28:13.193
(helicopter approaching)

28:16.321 --> 28:18.865
-KATHLEEN: Please help me.
-There’s no time.

28:18.907 --> 28:20.575
-We can make time.
-How?

28:20.617 --> 28:22.452
We can start over.
You can come with me.

28:22.494 --> 28:24.329
-No, they are
gonna shut it down.
-We can fix this.

28:24.371 --> 28:26.831
We can jump again,
take what we’ve learned

28:26.873 --> 28:30.293
and get more time
to figure out what to do
before they take it.

28:33.505 --> 28:35.674
We can fix this.

28:35.715 --> 28:37.550
We’ll be okay.

28:37.592 --> 28:38.593
Go.

28:43.807 --> 28:45.141
MAN: House clear?

28:45.183 --> 28:47.102
Yeah. Readings increase
closer to the shore.

28:47.143 --> 28:49.062
I think it’s in the water.

29:05.620 --> 29:08.039
(sighs)
Okay.

29:45.326 --> 29:48.121
<i>Pannenkoek!</i>
Get out of the way!

29:48.163 --> 29:49.497
-(horn honking)
-(tires screeching)

29:50.540 --> 29:52.542
(gasps)

29:56.004 --> 29:58.256
-(device chimes)
-I think you to can put down
the tablet, Finola.

29:58.298 --> 30:00.425
It’s pretty clear
where we need to go.

30:08.933 --> 30:12.437
Wow. This is intense.

30:12.479 --> 30:14.939
It’s obvious
what’s going on here.

30:14.981 --> 30:15.982
Alien invasion.

30:16.024 --> 30:18.068
It’s not aliens.

30:19.569 --> 30:22.322
Situation Team chopper
is 10 minutes out.

30:22.364 --> 30:24.783
You should call your father
immediately.

30:24.824 --> 30:26.326
He’ll know what to do.

30:27.660 --> 30:28.870
My father’s dead.

30:28.912 --> 30:30.997
What?

30:31.039 --> 30:33.833
No!

30:33.875 --> 30:35.251
I talked to him yesterday.

30:37.003 --> 30:39.214
How did he die?

30:52.310 --> 30:53.478
(latch clicks)

30:54.938 --> 30:56.272
Kathleen.

30:56.314 --> 30:58.566
(sighs)
You remember.

30:58.608 --> 31:00.110
Yeah.

31:00.151 --> 31:01.861
KATHLEEN:
Quickly.

31:03.863 --> 31:05.240
They’re getting worse.

31:06.616 --> 31:07.742
I’m scared.

31:07.784 --> 31:09.202
Shelby and Bryan
aren’t here this time.

31:09.244 --> 31:10.578
What if it’s too late?

31:14.165 --> 31:16.543
I have to call my father.

31:19.671 --> 31:23.383
(phone vibrates)

31:26.344 --> 31:27.887
Are you okay?

31:29.931 --> 31:32.225
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>I’m just looking at the...</i>

31:32.267 --> 31:33.977
<i>satellite data</i>
<i>from your location.</i>

31:34.019 --> 31:37.605
Can only imagine
what you’re seeing.

31:37.647 --> 31:39.357
Finola.

31:39.399 --> 31:40.817
Are you all right?

31:40.859 --> 31:42.736
<i>FINOLA: Dad.</i>

31:45.196 --> 31:48.825
I’m, uh... Yeah.

31:48.867 --> 31:50.994
(chuckles)

31:51.036 --> 31:53.163
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No, I’m okay.

31:53.204 --> 31:55.582
Well, don’t worry,
the team’s on its way
to you now.

31:55.623 --> 31:57.542
<i>We’ll figure this out.</i>

31:57.584 --> 31:59.419
That’s the thing, I have.

31:59.461 --> 32:01.338
I just don’t know how yet.

32:01.379 --> 32:02.505
<i>GEORGE:</i>
<i>What do you mean?</i>

32:02.547 --> 32:04.132
Okay, you have to listen to me.

32:04.174 --> 32:06.009
The Debris was triggered

32:06.051 --> 32:08.636
by a brother and sister
who would jumping realities.

32:08.678 --> 32:10.972
<i>And the last time they jumped,</i>
<i>they got separated,</i>

32:11.014 --> 32:13.183
<i>and they’ve been trying to get</i>
<i>back to each other ever since.</i>

32:13.224 --> 32:14.726
How many jumps have they made?

32:14.768 --> 32:16.603
<i>I don’t know.</i>
<i>I’m not sure.</i>

32:16.644 --> 32:18.521
<i>But that’s the thing.</i>
<i>There was an agent</i>

32:18.563 --> 32:19.898
<i>that is involved in this,</i>

32:19.939 --> 32:21.566
<i>he comes from</i>
<i>one of the realities</i>

32:21.608 --> 32:23.026
<i>that the brother</i>
<i>and sister visited.</i>

32:23.068 --> 32:25.779
He told me

32:25.820 --> 32:30.033
that there was
another version of me

32:30.075 --> 32:32.327
<i>from another reality</i>

32:32.369 --> 32:34.204
<i>that had almost figured out</i>
<i>the answer,</i>

32:34.245 --> 32:37.540
but reality was reset
before I had the chance
to give it to him.

32:37.582 --> 32:43.296
He said it had something
to do with bilateral deviation.

32:43.338 --> 32:47.092
<i>Now, I know that obviously</i>
<i>"bilateral" has got something</i>
<i>to do with two sides,</i>

32:47.133 --> 32:50.345
and there were two twins
who were trying to get
back to each other, but--

32:50.387 --> 32:53.223
All right. Well, you said this
all started when these twins
triggered in the Debris.

32:53.264 --> 32:54.808
Yes. Yes.

32:54.849 --> 32:56.559
<i>Well, it’s starts</i>
<i>with the two of them.</i>

32:56.601 --> 33:00.438
That caused the bilateral
deviation from the reality.

33:00.480 --> 33:01.856
Yes, yes, and--

33:01.898 --> 33:03.483
(helicopter approaching)

33:06.778 --> 33:08.488
The Situation Team’s here.
You’re going to have

33:08.530 --> 33:09.531
to get them to stand down.

33:09.572 --> 33:10.782
I need more time.

33:10.824 --> 33:12.242
<i>GEORGE:</i>
<i>I can’t do that.</i>

33:12.283 --> 33:13.952
<i>The situation’s too grave.</i>

33:13.993 --> 33:15.578
-Dad?
<i>-Yes.</i>

33:17.872 --> 33:19.624
If you were never going
to see me again,

33:19.666 --> 33:21.543
what would be the last thing
that you would say to me?

33:21.584 --> 33:25.588
No, don’t talk like that.
You’re brilliant.

33:25.630 --> 33:27.465
<i>And we are gonna figure</i>
<i>this out together.</i>

33:27.507 --> 33:28.967
But what would you say?

33:33.263 --> 33:35.724
I would say, I love you.

33:40.395 --> 33:41.813
I love you too.

33:44.024 --> 33:45.316
I love you.

33:55.493 --> 33:56.828
"Together."

33:57.996 --> 33:59.330
(helicopter approaching)

34:10.550 --> 34:12.469
-KATHLEEN: They’re here.
-FINOLA: Yeah.

34:12.510 --> 34:15.388
I think your brother and Bryan
failed because we weren’t
involved.

34:15.430 --> 34:17.307
We hadn’t figured it out
together.

34:17.349 --> 34:19.559
-Bilateral deviation.
-Yeah.

34:19.601 --> 34:24.230
You and your brother are two
strands of the same reality
that have become unraveled,

34:24.272 --> 34:27.233
-and that has messed
everything else up.
-What do you mean?

34:27.275 --> 34:29.652
You’ve been trying to get back
to each other but separately.

34:29.694 --> 34:32.906
But how can we jump together
if we’re in different realities?

34:32.947 --> 34:36.451
Because you both have to jump,
but at the same time.

34:36.493 --> 34:38.203
I thought we’d already
tried that.

34:38.244 --> 34:39.871
No, no, simultaneously.

34:39.913 --> 34:42.499
Because it has to end
the way it began,

34:42.540 --> 34:46.378
so we can get back
to the beginning and repair
the damage across all realities.

34:46.419 --> 34:49.047
-We have to find them.
-Yes. Go.

34:55.887 --> 34:57.555
FINOLA:
Oh, they’re back!

35:18.702 --> 35:22.122
All jump together.

35:27.877 --> 35:29.421
Two minutes.

35:32.215 --> 35:33.925
Okay.

35:37.429 --> 35:38.596
Ready?

35:40.056 --> 35:44.477
Three, two, one.

35:45.270 --> 35:47.105
(watch beeps)

35:50.525 --> 35:52.152
-(pounding on door)
-Finola.

35:58.950 --> 36:01.202
<i>MAN:</i>
<i>The Situation Team is here.</i>

36:01.244 --> 36:05.248
Upstairs. I’m going to take her
outside to get evaluated, okay?

36:05.290 --> 36:06.416
MAN: All right.

36:06.458 --> 36:08.043
(helicopter whirring)

36:08.084 --> 36:09.044
Run.

36:11.129 --> 36:15.675
When we jump and I get back
to my reality,

36:15.717 --> 36:17.010
do you think we’re gonna
remember it?

36:17.052 --> 36:19.387
I don’t know.
It happened before. Why?

36:19.429 --> 36:21.639
This is something
I really don’t want to forget,

36:21.681 --> 36:23.767
something my father said to me.

36:29.481 --> 36:33.109
Hey. Thank you for helping me.

36:33.151 --> 36:34.819
Yeah. Go.

36:40.367 --> 36:41.785
SHELBY:
Is it too late?

38:00.572 --> 38:01.990
Mm-hmm.

38:14.377 --> 38:15.879
I love the ocean.

38:19.132 --> 38:20.925
-You getting anything?
-(device scanning)

38:20.967 --> 38:23.678
Yeah. It’s faint.

38:26.931 --> 38:28.808
But it’s definitely here.

38:44.532 --> 38:48.536
Hi, there.
I’m Agent Bryan Beneventi.

38:48.578 --> 38:50.997
-This is Finola Jones.
-Hey.

38:51.039 --> 38:53.583
We’re with the government.

38:53.625 --> 38:55.210
We have a few questions
for you.

38:55.251 --> 38:56.252
I know.

39:00.173 --> 39:01.716
It’s in the ocean, Bryan.

39:03.218 --> 39:04.594
BRYAN: What is?

39:04.636 --> 39:07.931
SHELBY: Come on in.
I’ll tell you what I know.

39:23.238 --> 39:25.532
<i>Hey, Craig. It’s Vince</i>
<i>at the Federal Grill.</i>

39:25.573 --> 39:28.952
<i>I just want to confirm</i>
<i>a reservation for</i>

39:28.993 --> 39:31.830
<i>I hope to see you then.</i>
<i>Be good to see you.</i>

39:33.581 --> 39:37.377
Alexandra, did I miss
a lunch appointment today?

39:37.419 --> 39:39.379
ALEXANDRA:
You had no lunch booked today.

39:39.421 --> 39:40.839
Yeah, I didn’t think so.

39:40.880 --> 39:42.590
-Um, thanks. That’s all.
-Okay.

39:42.632 --> 39:44.801
-And would you close
the door behind you?
-Yeah.

39:53.018 --> 39:55.103

39:55.145 --> 39:57.063

<i>Julia’s voicemail.</i>

39:57.105 --> 39:58.773

40:32.682 --> 40:34.309
Julia?

41:00.335 --> 41:01.461
No.

41:01.503 --> 41:04.839
No, no, no, no, no...

41:07.550 --> 41:08.510

41:23.900 --> 41:25.151
Here you are, mate.

41:27.278 --> 41:29.656
Oh! Up above, down below,
too slow.

41:29.698 --> 41:31.199
Come on, you can get it.

41:43.795 --> 41:45.255
(tray clattering)

41:47.674 --> 41:49.384
On report.

41:54.431 --> 41:56.057

42:02.230 --> 42:03.398

42:13.491 --> 42:15.201
