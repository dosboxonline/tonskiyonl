22:03.389 --> 22:04.852
the fish you gave me
for my birthday

22:04.987 --> 22:06.722
that ate way too many
brain dots and got super smart

22:06.858 --> 22:08.392
with psychokinetic power and
robbed all those pets stores

22:08.528 --> 22:09.655
for their plastic fish tank
treasure chests

22:09.791 --> 22:11.654
because he thought
it was real money

22:11.790 --> 22:13.663
and ended up freezing to death
in a fishbowl
high up on the mountain

We have rebuilt Flippy
with titanium bones

Isn't rebuilding

23:50.529 --> 23:52.892
a psychokinetic evil fish
dangerous?

23:53.027 --> 23:55.826
Well, I-I suppose Flippy
could be extra dangerous

23:55.961 --> 23:57.660
now that he is super and mecha.

23:57.795 --> 23:58.895
And psychokinetic.

23:59.030 --> 24:00.770
-And psychokinetic.
-Huh?

24:00.905 --> 24:03.637
But he couldn't come to life
unless someone stole him

24:03.773 --> 24:05.904

the Living Spray Factory

24:06.040 --> 24:07.473

24:11.483 --> 24:13.280

-But who would do that?

24:13.416 --> 24:14.879
