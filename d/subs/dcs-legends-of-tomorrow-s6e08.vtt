33:58.949 --> 34:00.516
Enough!

34:00.560 --> 34:03.954
Can't you just hold it together
till we get the job done?

34:03.998 --> 34:05.695
I mean, I don't know
what's harder,

34:05.739 --> 34:08.220
finding the alien or keeping
the peace between you people.

34:08.263 --> 34:10.309
- Um, Nate, the worm, remember?

34:10.352 --> 34:12.354
Just do you want
to simmer it down.

34:14.922 --> 34:17.055
[rumbling]

34:19.013 --> 34:23.017
- You know what?
I won't simmer it down.

34:23.061 --> 34:25.367
I've been having a lot
of big feelings too, lately.

34:25.411 --> 34:28.240
Now's the exact right time
to share them.

34:28.283 --> 34:30.155
When Mick left the ship,

34:30.198 --> 34:32.592
it wasn't easy being
the O-est G.

34:32.635 --> 34:35.638
But did any of you check in
on my existential crisis?

34:35.682 --> 34:38.685
No. Because Nate's so chill,
isn't he?

34:38.728 --> 34:39.990
- Yeah, you're right,
we should talk.

34:40.034 --> 34:41.514
But maybe not
while the worm's coming.

34:41.557 --> 34:43.603
- I used to have Zari
to talk to, right?

34:43.646 --> 34:46.084
And while all of you are
hooking up getting engaged,

34:46.127 --> 34:48.912
I guess she's just stuck
in a totem forever.

34:48.956 --> 34:50.653
No offense,
I think you're great.

34:50.697 --> 34:52.829
It's not really
an either-or-thing.

34:52.873 --> 34:54.788
And don't get me started
about life on the ship.

34:54.831 --> 34:56.790
Six roommates
and I'm the only one

34:56.833 --> 34:59.009
that replaces the cartridges
and the fabricators.

34:59.053 --> 35:00.272
- I didn't know
they took cartridges.

35:00.315 --> 35:03.188
- Well, they do, genius.
They do!

35:03.231 --> 35:05.190
And I know one of you
changes the thermostat

35:05.233 --> 35:08.149
every night,
so don't blame it on Gideon.

35:08.193 --> 35:10.673
Well, since none of you
can hold it together,

35:10.717 --> 35:12.980
I guess I'll draw
the worm to me

35:13.023 --> 35:17.071
so you don't get eaten alive
because I'm so chill.

35:18.377 --> 35:20.944
So come and get me,
you alien slug.

35:22.642 --> 35:25.210
I got your romp right here.

35:25.253 --> 35:26.559

35:26.602 --> 35:28.343
- Spooner, you have
to do something.

35:28.387 --> 35:30.563
You don't know what it feels
like when they get in my head.

35:30.606 --> 35:34.480
So get into theirs. Let them
feel what you're feeling.

35:34.523 --> 35:36.743
Don't do it for me,
or for Nate.

could join the fight.

want to underestimate me

against 'em.
