02:37.824 --> 02:40.827
"Cosine of Y is equal to X,
then the arc cosine of X

02:40.827 --> 02:45.290
- is equal to the inverse"...
- Cosine, function of X,

02:45.290 --> 02:47.000
which is equal to Y.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.085
Uh-huh.

02:48.710 --> 02:51.547
You know, a very bad person
invented trigonometry.

02:52.214 --> 02:55.384
- Hey, can I drive to school today?
- Yikes.

02:56.218 --> 02:57.845
What? I'm a good driver.

02:59.054 --> 03:00.055
Okay.

03:01.974 --> 03:03.141
Have a good day.

03:03.141 --> 03:04.560
Coffee to go.

03:05.060 --> 03:08.939
What? Thank you.
Oh, my gosh. You're my hero.

03:10.315 --> 03:11.233
Have fun.

03:11.233 --> 03:12.401
See you guys later.

03:14.820 --> 03:15.821
I'll let you drive.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.155
Thanks.

03:49.313 --> 03:51.398
Hey, red light. Red ligh-- Red light!

03:51.398 --> 03:52.316
Charlie!

03:55.652 --> 03:56.778
Yeah.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.530
- Sorry, Dad.
- It's okay.

04:02.034 --> 04:05.204
Hey, so, you wanna go
for a climb after school?

04:05.913 --> 04:10.542
Yeah, I was kinda thinking I might
go over to Brooke's after school.

04:10.542 --> 04:12.503
How's that going with her, by the way?

04:13.670 --> 04:14.671
I don't know.

04:14.671 --> 04:16.089
Why don't you just tell her?

04:16.673 --> 04:18.841
Does Brooke even know that you like her?

04:18.841 --> 04:20.719
What if she likes Drew?

04:21.803 --> 04:25.015
Then you know the score,
that she has bad taste.

04:27.935 --> 04:29.061
Hey.

04:29.061 --> 04:32.147
- <i>Hey. Where are you?</i>
- Have a look.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.609
<i>Charlie-o Andretti.
You driving your old man around?</i>

04:35.609 --> 04:37.736
Yeah, I was driving myself to school.

04:38.320 --> 04:41.740
<i>Oh, God. Jason, this is
a little bit weird, but I won the Pavia.</i>

04:41.740 --> 04:42.741
What?

04:42.741 --> 04:44.618
<i>It should be you.
You know this. I know this--</i>

04:44.618 --> 04:46.328
Nah. Come on, man.

04:46.328 --> 04:48.747
- I'm so happy for you.
- <i>Oh, shit. I gotta take this call,</i>

04:48.747 --> 04:52.042
<i>but I'm gonna hit you back,
and we're gonna celebrate tonight.</i>

04:52.042 --> 04:53.544
Okay. Yeah.

04:56.964 --> 04:57.965
Oh, sh--

04:58.549 --> 05:01.260
Don't worry about them. Just-- You do you.

05:02.010 --> 05:03.345
- Asshole.
- Yeah.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.794
What's that supposed to be?

05:38.755 --> 05:39.965
It's a cat.

05:41.175 --> 05:45.304
You have a cat in a sealed box.

05:45.304 --> 05:49.308
And also in the box,
we have a vial of poison,

05:50.100 --> 05:53.228
a single radioactive atom and...

05:53.770 --> 05:55.230
a Geiger counter.

05:56.523 --> 06:00.611
Now, if there's no atomic decay,
the cat lives.

06:00.611 --> 06:02.738
But if the atom does decay,

06:02.738 --> 06:06.617
then the Geiger counter
will detect radiation.

06:06.617 --> 06:10.162
This will set off a charge,
which will break the vial,

06:10.162 --> 06:12.331
and poor cat dies.

06:12.331 --> 06:13.457
Aw.

06:13.457 --> 06:16.043
"Aw" is right.

06:16.043 --> 06:19.922
Now, the Copenhagen interpretation
of quantum mechanics

06:19.922 --> 06:22.674
suggests something crazy.

06:22.674 --> 06:28.222
Before we look inside,
the atom exists in a superposition,

06:28.222 --> 06:30.849
which is a fancy way of saying

06:30.849 --> 06:33.894
that it is in an undetermined state

06:34.436 --> 06:37.689
of both decaying and not decaying.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.816
Which means what?

06:40.317 --> 06:42.402
This guy had a thing for torturing cats.

06:43.820 --> 06:45.531
Thanks, Riley. No.

06:45.531 --> 06:48.242
SchrÃ¶dinger was his name,

06:48.242 --> 06:50.619
and he had a thing
for understanding the universe.

06:58.627 --> 07:02.881
The answer, for anybody who cares to know,
is that the atom in superposition

07:02.881 --> 07:07.010
means that the cat is both alive
and it is dead.

07:22.234 --> 07:23.610
His name's Woody Gwyn,

07:23.610 --> 07:26.154
one of America's
great contemporary landscape masters.

07:26.905 --> 07:28.198
What's the medium?

07:28.198 --> 07:29.283
Egg tempera.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.661
It's more challenging to work with
than oil. Dries very quickly,

07:32.661 --> 07:36.498
so brush strokes can't be reworked,
but you get these very precise lines,

07:36.498 --> 07:39.168
- more luminosity than you get with oil.
- You just making shit up now?

07:39.168 --> 07:40.586
Yeah, about half of it.

07:40.586 --> 07:42.296
- I know.
- Yeah. Hi.

07:45.090 --> 07:47.509
- It's incredible.
- Yeah, I know.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.803
- You ready?
- Let me get my stuff.

07:50.387 --> 07:53.140
- I could paint that.
- You can do anything, babe.

07:54.183 --> 07:56.685
I'm apartment hunting Friday,
if you wanna come.

07:57.352 --> 08:01.440
I would love to,
but Friday is my training day.

08:01.440 --> 08:03.901
- And how's that going?
- You know what?

08:04.443 --> 08:08.113
My cycling time and my running time
aren't bad actually,

08:08.113 --> 08:09.656
but my swimming really needs work.

08:09.656 --> 08:12.159
And right now, I can't even imagine
doing them all back-to-back.

08:12.159 --> 08:15.245
You know, there are less agonizing ways
for you to avoid your family.

08:15.245 --> 08:18.373
- I'm just saying.
- I'm not avoiding them.

08:18.373 --> 08:20.667
- So, when's the race?
- Next summer.

09:49.423 --> 09:51.508
More wine, right?

09:52.217 --> 09:54.261
Well, I think it would be foolish not to.

09:54.845 --> 09:56.346
That's why I love you.

09:58.056 --> 10:00.726
'Cause I'm an advocate
of opening more wine always?

10:00.726 --> 10:02.936
That's the source
of your adoration for me?

10:02.936 --> 10:05.189
Yeah, I think that's the only reason
we've made it this far.

10:05.189 --> 10:06.190
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

10:06.190 --> 10:09.193
Come on, guys.
You're scarring me for life over here.

10:09.193 --> 10:10.485
Oh, yeah?

10:11.153 --> 10:12.154
Close your eyes.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.116
- Stick with red, huh? Yeah.
- Yeah.

10:21.580 --> 10:22.831
Your phone's blowing up.

10:23.874 --> 10:26.043
- Who is it?
- It's Ryan,

10:27.544 --> 10:30.506
and he's wondering where you are?

10:32.716 --> 10:34.676
So, Ryan won the Pavia.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.178
- What?
- Yeah.

10:37.513 --> 10:39.598
- When?
- I found out today.

10:39.598 --> 10:41.225
It's pretty great, huh?

10:41.225 --> 10:43.852
Yeah. The Pavia's a huge deal.

10:43.852 --> 10:45.979
Yeah. Well, I mean,
he gets a million dollars,

10:45.979 --> 10:49.358
and it opens up the floodgates for,
you know, grant money and so on.

10:49.358 --> 10:52.277
So, why aren't you going
to this thing that he invited you to?

10:52.277 --> 10:54.905
It's family night. I told him I'd catch up
with him another time.

10:54.905 --> 10:57.449
Okay, it's also family night
52 nights a year.

10:58.617 --> 10:59.701
Where is it happening?

11:01.161 --> 11:02.538
The Village Tap.

11:02.538 --> 11:03.664
The Village Tap?

11:03.664 --> 11:04.748
Yes.

11:05.332 --> 11:07.751
He picked a place
around the corner from our house.

11:07.751 --> 11:11.672
It's nowhere near where he lives.
Why do you think he did that?

11:11.672 --> 11:15.592
Because he knows that if he picks
any place remotely far away,

11:15.592 --> 11:16.885
I'm not gonna show.

11:16.885 --> 11:19.263
Yeah. Said with love, don't be a dick.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.600
I'm glad you're having a good time. No.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.310
You know he would show up for you.

11:46.707 --> 11:48.250
Are you happy for Ryan?

11:49.042 --> 11:50.335
Of course I am.

11:55.757 --> 11:57.050
Okay, go show him.

11:58.343 --> 11:59.344
Yeah.

12:05.642 --> 12:06.810
I love you.

12:07.728 --> 12:08.854
I love you too.

13:01.782 --> 13:02.950
Hey.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.577
- Sup, man. Nice to see you.
- You too.

13:13.544 --> 13:15.295
- There's a similar s--
- Hey.

13:17.256 --> 13:19.883
Get over here. Get-- Fuck.

13:20.467 --> 13:21.510
Fuck you.

13:21.510 --> 13:23.011
Fuck you, man.

13:23.011 --> 13:25.472
Why are you here? Did Daniela force this?

13:25.472 --> 13:27.140
- I don't know. Not really.
- Did she bribe you?

13:27.140 --> 13:29.351
She pointed out that if you, you know--

13:29.351 --> 13:33.063
You're having a little celebration
at my local bar, then it's probably

13:33.063 --> 13:35.148
- a desperate plea for my attention.
- That's fair.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.860
And if I didn't show up,
I'd be an asshole.

13:38.443 --> 13:41.238
Your wife is a beautiful genius,
and I appreciate her.

13:41.238 --> 13:43.699
This man loves scotch.

13:43.699 --> 13:45.617
- I know.
- He knows.

13:45.617 --> 13:48.161
What can we do to bring him joy?
What is the nicest--

13:48.161 --> 13:50.497
- The best one you have? Macallan.
- Macallan Rare Cask.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.416
Yes, bring him the bottle.

13:52.416 --> 13:54.001
- Come on. I don't--
- Yes.

13:54.585 --> 13:57.421
- The bottle?
- Well, it's just more fun.

13:57.421 --> 13:59.381
- Okay. Good choice.
- More stuff is more fun.

13:59.381 --> 14:02.009
- That's my last one.
- Thanks. That is good timing.

14:02.009 --> 14:05.179
- Yeah, I'll drink it alone.
- Did you hear that squeak?

14:05.179 --> 14:08.098
- Is that the sign of good scotch?
- It's a cork.

14:13.937 --> 14:15.063
Congratulations.

14:16.064 --> 14:18.901
Could I
introduce you to a bunch of people?

14:19.860 --> 14:23.280
The kind you don't really wanna meet,
but I want them to have an experience.

14:23.280 --> 14:25.490
Guys, this is Jason.

14:25.490 --> 14:28.285
- Hi. Claire. Nice to meet you.
- Edward.

14:28.285 --> 14:32.247
Ivan. You are so lucky
to have known him for so long.

14:32.247 --> 14:34.166
Crazy how his mind works, you know?

14:34.166 --> 14:35.959
I mean, like, I know I'm a genius,

14:35.959 --> 14:38.504
but I mean, like, when he talks,
it's like...

14:39.713 --> 14:40.964
And what do you do?

14:42.508 --> 14:46.136
- I teach physics at Lakemont.
- He's a professor.

14:47.221 --> 14:48.180
Lakemont.

14:48.722 --> 14:49.973
Yeah.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.225
- Yes.
- All right.

14:51.225 --> 14:53.602
I'm a member of the Ryan fan club.

14:53.602 --> 14:56.438
- I'm gonna smother you with my love.
- Wow.

14:57.606 --> 14:59.149
- Ready?
- Come on.

14:59.650 --> 15:02.402
What exactly was the citation again?

15:02.402 --> 15:04.863
And don't pretend
you haven't memorized it.

15:04.863 --> 15:07.032
Are you kidding me?
I'm gonna have it fucking tattooed:

15:07.032 --> 15:09.368
"For his groundbreaking work
in the field of neuroscience,

15:09.368 --> 15:12.538
and identifying the prefrontal cortex
as a consciousness generator."

15:17.334 --> 15:20.254
God, I owe you.
Those notes were essential.

15:20.254 --> 15:23.298
So, come on. What's it like?

15:23.298 --> 15:28.387
We're scientists. We sign on
to struggle and search our entire lives

15:28.387 --> 15:30.097
in anonymity, you know?

15:30.097 --> 15:32.140
We're supposed to be fucking rock stars.

15:33.225 --> 15:35.143
Congratulations.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.603
Thank you.

15:36.603 --> 15:40.482
Hi. Will you--
You gonna be over there later?

15:41.483 --> 15:42.484
So will I.

15:42.484 --> 15:43.735
Okay.

15:45.362 --> 15:46.405
Thanks.

15:46.405 --> 15:47.573
Okay.

15:51.285 --> 15:52.619
I don't know.

15:56.999 --> 15:58.000
Hey.

15:58.584 --> 16:03.172
Daniela wasn't full of shit
when she said I wanted to see you.

16:04.464 --> 16:05.465
I did.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.844
And it wasn't
for some bullshit victory lap.

16:11.305 --> 16:13.140
Remember Andrew Darab?

16:13.140 --> 16:14.474
Andrew Darab?

16:16.268 --> 16:19.521
Rich Andrew, "I'm too good for this dorm"?

16:19.521 --> 16:21.607
He and I have a hundred million dollars
in our war chest.

16:21.607 --> 16:23.650
And after today,
it's gonna at least triple.

16:27.154 --> 16:28.780
- Really? Wow.
- Yeah.

16:28.780 --> 16:31.033
Neurotech company, so...

16:34.328 --> 16:36.455
I want you to be a part of it, Jay.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.707
I want you to join us.

16:39.791 --> 16:42.669
Hey, if you're pinching yourself
every morning on your way to Lakemont,

16:42.669 --> 16:45.130
then please tell me to fuck off,
and I will.

16:45.130 --> 16:48.217
No, I'm not telling you to fuck off.

16:48.217 --> 16:51.178
'Cause whatever Lakemont's paying you,
we will crush that. We'll smash it.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.263
Yeah, well, that's not hard.

16:57.935 --> 17:00.062
And you're doing all this in Chicago?

17:02.231 --> 17:04.233
San Francisco. But...

17:04.233 --> 17:07.819
Jason, we already have the space.
It's incredible.

17:07.819 --> 17:08.904
Yeah.

17:11.365 --> 17:12.574
Our life is...

17:14.159 --> 17:15.786
It's here, you know?

17:15.786 --> 17:17.746
I mean, up the road.

17:18.288 --> 17:21.875
I hear you. Just maybe run it by Daniela.

17:22.459 --> 17:24.044
See what she thinks.
I think it'll be great for her

17:24.044 --> 17:26.088
- and for Charlie.
- Oh, God. Shit.

17:26.088 --> 17:27.172
For me.

17:27.172 --> 17:28.882
I'm really gonna have to get back
to them actually.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.050
All right.

17:30.884 --> 17:34.471
- Okay.
- You go, you know, enjoy yourself with...

17:34.471 --> 17:36.598
- No, I will. I will do that.
- I mean, you know.

17:36.598 --> 17:39.977
I'm definitely going-- But, hey, come on.
It'd be me and you again.

17:40.644 --> 17:42.563
Just making stuff.

17:43.146 --> 17:45.732
New stuff. Amazing stuff.

18:22.561 --> 18:24.813
You dipshit! You almost died.

18:44.499 --> 18:46.502
Hey, man. Can you spare a dollar?

18:51.381 --> 18:52.382
All right.

18:56.970 --> 18:58.138
Don't move!

19:01.141 --> 19:03.602
Give me your phone. Give me your phone!

19:04.144 --> 19:05.938
Start walking. Now.

19:06.980 --> 19:09.816
All right. Get in the car. Open the door.

19:09.816 --> 19:11.985
- Hey, I'm not--
- Get in the car.

19:12.903 --> 19:15.531
Or you can bleed out
on the sidewalk right here.

19:17.366 --> 19:18.784
- Get in!
- No.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.001
Look at me. Jason.

19:28.919 --> 19:30.295
If you fuck this up,

19:30.796 --> 19:33.006
if you don't do exactly what I say,

19:33.674 --> 19:34.800
I will kill you.

19:35.509 --> 19:36.510
Okay?

19:37.219 --> 19:38.220
Now drive.

19:48.272 --> 19:50.357
- Who the fuck are you?
- Shut up.

19:57.447 --> 20:00.534
Eyes on the road. Keep driving.

20:05.455 --> 20:07.833
What's the passcode to your phone?

20:09.293 --> 20:12.254
I know this. Father's birthday reversed?

20:14.173 --> 20:15.174
Is that right?

20:16.884 --> 20:17.885
That's right.

20:25.809 --> 20:27.519
How is Ryan?

20:30.731 --> 20:33.442
He offered me a job.

20:33.942 --> 20:35.152
What kind of job?

20:35.152 --> 20:38.614
He's starting a neurotech company
in San Francisco.

20:38.614 --> 20:41.533
- What did you say?
- Well, I didn't give him an answer.

20:41.533 --> 20:43.744
Is-- If he's done some--

20:43.744 --> 20:46.038
Take this exit. Now!

21:18.153 --> 21:20.113
Get out. Come on!

21:27.329 --> 21:28.330
Hey!

21:30.374 --> 21:31.542
What are you doing?

21:33.001 --> 21:34.711
Take off your clothes.

22:00.863 --> 22:02.322
Start moving.

22:35.647 --> 22:36.690
Down there.

23:09.348 --> 23:12.184
What was that? What-- Was that a needle?

23:13.060 --> 23:14.770
Get up. We don't have much time.

23:16.688 --> 23:18.232
What did you give me?

23:21.735 --> 23:23.195
Open the bag.

23:29.117 --> 23:32.538
Get dressed. You'll be unconscious soon.

23:45.259 --> 23:46.760
What are we...

23:48.220 --> 23:49.888
What are we doing here?

24:05.612 --> 24:07.114
What is that?

24:11.410 --> 24:12.661
It's...

24:14.121 --> 24:15.122
possibility.

24:32.014 --> 24:35.184
Are you happy with your life?

24:35.184 --> 24:39.813
Or have you ever wondered
what else you could have been? Answer me.

24:43.108 --> 24:45.027
What else I could have--

24:47.112 --> 24:49.031
Well, yeah.

24:49.031 --> 24:53.452
Good. Now you hold on to
that thought like your life depends on it.

24:56.246 --> 24:59.208
You're gonna be scared,
but you can make it yours.

25:01.168 --> 25:04.421
And you can have everything
that you missed out on.

25:06.465 --> 25:11.428
I'm sorry, but I'm doing this for us.

25:12.888 --> 25:14.139
Both of us.

25:17.768 --> 25:19.144
Who are you?

25:25.901 --> 25:28.445
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

26:07.025 --> 26:11.738
Hey. I need to go home.

26:14.324 --> 26:15.701
You are home.

26:15.701 --> 26:17.160
I need to check your pupils.

26:18.787 --> 26:20.497
Good. Follow the light.

26:20.497 --> 26:22.124
Where am--

26:28.046 --> 26:29.590
Test everything.

28:17.739 --> 28:18.740
Who are you?

28:24.454 --> 28:25.873
You don't recognize me?

28:31.211 --> 28:32.212
No.

28:34.631 --> 28:35.674
That's okay.

28:38.594 --> 28:39.678
I'm Amanda.

28:46.226 --> 28:47.686
What's happened to me?

28:47.686 --> 28:51.565
I'm-- I have no idea what's happening.

28:51.565 --> 28:53.275
We'll figure it out.

28:54.359 --> 28:56.486
You've been through a lot.

28:57.571 --> 28:58.822
Okay?

29:01.491 --> 29:02.826
I have good news.

29:03.994 --> 29:05.120
You're all cleared.

29:07.456 --> 29:08.624
Cleared of what?

29:09.333 --> 29:13.086
Radiation exposure,
biohazards, infectious disease.

29:13.712 --> 29:16.715
We'll have complete results
from your blood work in the morning.

29:17.466 --> 29:19.426
You're cleared from quarantine.

29:21.094 --> 29:22.262
Quarantine.

29:24.431 --> 29:26.266
I am so confused.

29:30.270 --> 29:32.773
Where am I? What is this place?

29:51.583 --> 29:52.835
Leighton?

29:54.002 --> 29:55.087
You remember me?

29:55.754 --> 29:57.297
Yeah. It's been...

29:58.966 --> 30:00.133
Come here.

30:00.133 --> 30:01.635
- ...a while.
- Yeah.

30:02.386 --> 30:05.013
What's going on? What the fuck is this?

30:05.889 --> 30:07.432
This is your triumph.

30:09.810 --> 30:11.979
I'm Amanda Lucas, lab psychiatrist,

30:11.979 --> 30:14.189
joined tonight by Leighton Vance, our CEO,

30:14.189 --> 30:17.943
and Jason Dessen,
our chief science officer and cofounder.

30:17.943 --> 30:19.027
What?

30:26.910 --> 30:27.911
Welcome back.

30:29.329 --> 30:30.330
Hey.

30:33.584 --> 30:36.253
Most of the team
rushed in from the city to be here.

30:38.380 --> 30:40.007
You're the only one who has returned.

30:41.675 --> 30:42.676
What?

30:44.636 --> 30:46.930
Do you have any sense
of how long you've been gone?

30:48.849 --> 30:50.559
Fourteen months and ten days.

30:53.645 --> 30:55.355
Listen, I know you're exhausted,

30:55.355 --> 30:58.859
but we were hoping you could tell us
a little bit about where you've been.

31:00.444 --> 31:02.905
What you saw.
You know, how you made it back.

31:03.697 --> 31:05.157
We can start small.

31:05.157 --> 31:07.951
What's the last thing you remember
before waking up in that hanger?

31:07.951 --> 31:09.286
I was at a bar.

31:09.953 --> 31:11.705
- A bar?
- Yeah.

31:11.705 --> 31:12.956
By yourself?

31:13.498 --> 31:16.668
No. I was with someone.

31:16.668 --> 31:19.129
- Who?
- Ryan.

31:20.839 --> 31:22.216
Ryan Holder.

31:27.846 --> 31:31.308
Do you remember how you got the cuts
and bruises on your face?

31:33.185 --> 31:34.728
Yeah, someone hit me.

31:35.812 --> 31:37.439
Can you remember who?

31:37.439 --> 31:39.441
No, I don't know.

31:40.234 --> 31:41.902
How do you not know?
Where were you, Jason?

31:41.902 --> 31:45.322
I don't-- I just don't know. I--

31:45.322 --> 31:49.993
I don't know what any of this fucking is.

31:49.993 --> 31:51.537
I don't know any of these people.

31:51.537 --> 31:54.665
I haven't seen you in God knows how long.

31:55.249 --> 31:58.460
I don't know what is going on, right?

31:58.460 --> 31:59.628
I wanna go home.

31:59.628 --> 32:04.424
Just wanna go home,
'cause I'm freaking out.

32:09.263 --> 32:11.306
We're gonna
get you settled in for the night.

32:11.306 --> 32:13.684
But right now
we need to monitor your vitals,

32:13.684 --> 32:16.562
track your progress
towards regaining your memories.

32:16.562 --> 32:19.523
Listen, I know you probably don't know
this, but we missed you.

32:19.523 --> 32:21.733
- Watch out!
- Jason!

32:50.637 --> 32:52.222
Forget your badge, Dr. Dessen?

32:52.890 --> 32:54.016
Yeah.

32:54.016 --> 32:55.851
Good to see you again.

32:58.520 --> 33:00.314
- Thanks. Thank you.
- Have a good night.

33:02.399 --> 33:03.859
Jason? Jason!

33:03.859 --> 33:05.694
Lock it down! Don't let him leave!

33:05.694 --> 33:06.778
Jason, stop!

33:08.864 --> 33:11.283
Jason! Jason.

33:16.246 --> 33:17.331
Stop!

33:24.129 --> 33:25.422
Stop!

33:51.365 --> 33:52.366
Jason!

34:18.100 --> 34:20.101
Hey. Hey!

34:29.319 --> 34:30.529
Thank you.

34:38.161 --> 34:41.581
Forty-four Eleanor Street,
Logan Square, please.

34:55.846 --> 34:57.222
What happened to you?

34:57.222 --> 34:59.391
Some guy started some shit.

35:08.233 --> 35:10.110
Could you go a little faster please?

35:58.158 --> 35:59.159
Jason?

36:06.416 --> 36:07.417
The fuck?

36:52.504 --> 36:54.298
Your food's in the fridge.

37:13.692 --> 37:14.943
I...

37:16.445 --> 37:17.821
brought you something.

37:19.531 --> 37:22.701
Mint chocolate chip? Really?

37:27.331 --> 37:29.458
I was-- It was getting so late,

37:29.458 --> 37:31.793
I just stopped in at a gas station.
I didn't--

37:31.793 --> 37:33.462
Why didn't you call me?

37:33.462 --> 37:34.713
I called you.

37:35.547 --> 37:36.632
I texted you.

37:36.632 --> 37:39.718
Time just got away from me. I'm sorry.

38:07.204 --> 38:08.622
I'm still mad at you.

38:11.542 --> 38:12.543
Did you eat?

38:13.502 --> 38:14.503
No.

38:15.921 --> 38:17.047
Well, you should eat.

38:17.589 --> 38:19.049
I'll warm up your food.

38:21.510 --> 38:22.970
How drunk are you?

38:22.970 --> 38:24.388
What? I'm not.

38:32.563 --> 38:34.147
What the fuck is going on?

38:41.154 --> 38:45.951
Look, Ryan offered me a job.

38:47.744 --> 38:48.787
Doing what?

38:49.830 --> 38:51.915
He's starting a neurotech company.

39:03.468 --> 39:04.553
What did you say?

39:05.888 --> 39:09.808
Well, I said that
I'd have to talk to you first.

39:13.020 --> 39:14.062
What do you think?

39:15.814 --> 39:18.775
Well, the job is most likely
in San Francisco.

39:19.443 --> 39:21.612
And our life is here.

39:25.866 --> 39:30.204
Do you remember what I said to you
all those years ago,

39:30.204 --> 39:32.998
when we decided to do this?

39:38.879 --> 39:40.214
Yes, I do.

39:41.882 --> 39:42.966
Tell me.

39:47.095 --> 39:51.642
You said that at the end of your life,

39:53.310 --> 39:57.439
you would rather have memories of me
than of a cold, sterile lab.

39:59.024 --> 40:01.193
And I stand by that.

40:03.195 --> 40:04.321
Still.

40:12.871 --> 40:13.872
Okay.

40:15.832 --> 40:16.834
Okay.

40:19.294 --> 40:20.838
You're forgiven.

40:42.192 --> 40:43.819
How did you get in here?

40:47.656 --> 40:49.283
I live here with you.

41:03.672 --> 41:09.094
What is this? Some kind of joke?

41:09.094 --> 41:11.096
No.

41:20.647 --> 41:21.648
Where are they?

41:22.691 --> 41:23.692
Who?

41:26.361 --> 41:29.114
Daniela. Daniela!

41:29.114 --> 41:31.742
- Jason.
- Have you done something to them?

41:31.742 --> 41:33.785
I don't know who you're talking about.

41:34.870 --> 41:36.163
Charlie.

41:42.044 --> 41:43.045
This...

41:46.798 --> 41:48.717
This is my son's room.

41:50.219 --> 41:51.220
It--

41:55.182 --> 41:56.183
What?

41:57.893 --> 41:58.936
No.

42:04.066 --> 42:05.108
This is...

42:06.527 --> 42:07.528
No.

42:23.043 --> 42:24.044
Jason.

42:24.837 --> 42:28.215
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Where's Daniela?

42:28.215 --> 42:30.634
- <i>Who?</i>
- Dessen. Daniela Dessen.

42:30.634 --> 42:33.095
- <i>I think you misdialed.</i>
- No, I have not dis--

42:34.555 --> 42:37.891
- What? Oh, man. Fuck.
- Jason.

42:40.978 --> 42:43.480
This is-- I mean, what is this shit?

42:44.231 --> 42:46.483
- <i>Wrong number. Fuck off.</i>
- Hey! No, listen.

42:53.907 --> 42:55.033
Who is Daniela?

42:55.033 --> 42:57.160
She's my wife.

42:58.912 --> 42:59.913
Charlie?

43:01.665 --> 43:02.833
What the fuck?

43:09.089 --> 43:10.299
Oh, my boy.

43:12.176 --> 43:13.260
Yeah.

43:18.307 --> 43:20.559
Will you just let me talk to him alone?

43:26.106 --> 43:30.027
This is all wrong. And it...

43:30.861 --> 43:33.363
Let me help you.

43:34.448 --> 43:35.449
Okay?

43:36.366 --> 43:38.160
Look at me. You know me.

43:38.160 --> 43:40.454
I have never seen you in my life!

43:54.593 --> 43:57.221
Look, do you wanna help me?
Where the fuck is my wife?

43:57.221 --> 43:59.014
You don't have a wife!

44:02.267 --> 44:03.268
No.

44:03.936 --> 44:07.439
Jason. Jason!

45:00.659 --> 45:01.827
Oh, my God.

45:02.411 --> 45:03.412
What happened?

45:07.958 --> 45:09.960
You wouldn't believe me if I told you.
