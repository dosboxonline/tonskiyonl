All right, rookie.

11:06.207 --> 11:07.208
It's time to get
your hands dirty.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.250
The checklist.

11:09.251 --> 11:11.921
Skip even one step,
and someone dies.

11:12.713 --> 11:13.964
You.

11:15.800 --> 11:18.177
It's a little homicide humor
to kick off the day.

11:18.302 --> 11:19.970
[chuckles]

11:20.096 --> 11:21.888
Okay.

11:21.889 --> 11:23.807
So, the area's already
been secured.

11:23.808 --> 11:27.395
There were no witnesses.
The next step: documentation.

11:27.520 --> 11:28.853
A lot of rookies
make the mistake

11:28.854 --> 11:30.189
of only focusing on the body.

11:30.314 --> 11:32.273
We need to photograph
the entire scene.

11:32.274 --> 11:34.984
Especially any blood.

11:34.985 --> 11:36.529
Spatter matters.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.365
I prefer the spiral method.

11:39.490 --> 11:41.701

11:46.664 --> 11:47.956

[Dexter]
<i>The body was in full rigor,</i>

11:50.042 --> 11:53.838
<i>meaning the killer had struck
a minimum of eight hours ago.</i>

11:54.588 --> 11:55.964
<i>Decayed incisors.</i>

11:55.965 --> 11:57.799

11:57.800 --> 12:00.219
<i>Crack. Cocaine. Maybe both.</i>

[Angel] Can somebody bag
that crack pipe?

12:07.059 --> 12:08.935
[Dexter] <i>The killer must
have approached from behind.</i>

12:08.936 --> 12:11.939
<i>The victim startled.
He turned around.</i>

12:13.357 --> 12:15.526
Morgan, you get all that?

12:18.529 --> 12:21.781
The killer was here,
right in front of the victim.

12:21.782 --> 12:23.075
No exit wound.

12:23.200 --> 12:26.494
Must have used
a s-small-caliber pistol.

12:26.495 --> 12:27.872
And when the victim was shot,

12:27.997 --> 12:30.707
his blood spattered
through the entry wound

12:30.708 --> 12:32.167
and onto the ground.

12:32.168 --> 12:35.796
Except... where it hit
the killer.

12:37.047 --> 12:38.423
You see the void?

12:38.424 --> 12:40.426
<i>Where there's no blood?</i>

12:41.302 --> 12:43.137
That's where the killer
was standing.

12:45.264 --> 12:46.973
Batista, come over here.

12:46.974 --> 12:49.477
Morgan, tell Batista
what you just told me.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.771
The killer was standing
in front of the victim

12:51.896 --> 12:53.021
when he shot him.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.774
You see the void
in the blood spatter?

12:56.275 --> 12:58.402
That's where the killer was.

12:59.403 --> 13:01.947

13:06.202 --> 13:07.452

Yeah.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.705
Okay, Morgan,
tell them your hypothesis.

13:11.540 --> 13:14.126
The killer was right in front
of the victim.

13:14.251 --> 13:16.837
The void in the blood spatter
is where he was standing.

13:16.962 --> 13:18.506
[chuckles softly]
Well, we've got ourselves

13:18.631 --> 13:20.381
a real blue-chipper here,
don't we, boys?

13:20.382 --> 13:22.509
[Bobby] Yeah. I mean,
we would've never known

13:22.510 --> 13:24.345
the vic got shot at close range
except for the gunpowder burn

13:24.470 --> 13:25.720
in the middle of his forehead.

13:25.721 --> 13:27.973

13:30.476 --> 13:32.060

13:32.061 --> 13:34.814

for a sec.

13:37.441 --> 13:38.567
Come on.

13:39.443 --> 13:40.401
They're just giving you
a hard time

13:40.402 --> 13:41.695

13:41.821 --> 13:43.155
Oh. [chuckles]

13:43.280 --> 13:44.697
Weird, but that's okay.

13:44.698 --> 13:46.366
It's gallows humor.

13:46.367 --> 13:50.537
It's the only way we can deal
with stuff like this every day.

13:50.538 --> 13:53.833
Makes sense. Doesn't bother me.

13:53.958 --> 13:55.917
Good for you.

13:55.918 --> 13:57.502
Now you just got to join in.

13:57.503 --> 13:59.672
You know?
Give 'em a hard time back.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.589
It's like I always taught you.

14:01.590 --> 14:03.259
You got to blend in.

14:04.009 --> 14:07.346
