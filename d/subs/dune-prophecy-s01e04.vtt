- I had to lay low for weeks.
- But you got it?

16:46.506 --> 16:49.425
They don't call me
"Duri don't worry"
for nothin'.

16:49.426 --> 16:52.469
The Imperial guards
have been making
things difficult.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.347
I had to improvise.

16:55.056 --> 16:57.016
(beeping, power surges)

16:57.017 --> 17:00.144
This will do all
the things you want,
but better.

17:00.145 --> 17:01.187
Better how?

17:01.980 --> 17:03.148
Really big boom.

17:04.983 --> 17:07.068
(indistinct chatter)

17:07.819 --> 17:10.822
(club music playing)

17:19.039 --> 17:21.291
I see the Landsraad's
good for business.

17:21.291 --> 17:22.834
Can't wait
to spoil the party.

17:27.672 --> 17:30.632
- So, no issues
with the Ixian?
- Keiran Atreides: None.

17:30.633 --> 17:32.176
Duri got us
an autonomous drone

17:32.177 --> 17:34.095
modified with
a thermal bomb.

17:34.679 --> 17:36.472
Once I release it
into the vents,

17:36.473 --> 17:39.726
Duri swears
it will make its way
to the throne room.

17:40.226 --> 17:44.229
As soon as the Emperor
makes his appearance
at the High Council,

17:44.230 --> 17:45.814
Kieran unlatches
the grates.

17:45.815 --> 17:46.899
Then you
hightail it out

17:46.900 --> 17:48.567
before it
reaches the dais,

17:48.568 --> 17:51.236
- and then...
- Our little resistance

17:51.237 --> 17:52.863
becomes
a full-fledged
rebellion.

17:52.864 --> 17:54.908
And the spice
will finally flow...

17:56.409 --> 17:57.660
to all of us.

17:58.203 --> 17:59.996
I'm gonna program in
the palace schematics.

18:00.413 --> 18:02.415
Don't get into
too much trouble.

18:08.880 --> 18:11.508
You, um, you sure
you're up for this?

18:12.050 --> 18:13.885
You seem a little
bit spooked.

18:14.886 --> 18:17.097
- I don't need
to convince you.
- No.

18:18.181 --> 18:19.974
But you should probably
convince yourself.

18:21.226 --> 18:25.438
Making the Imperium better
comes at a cost.

18:27.565 --> 18:28.774
You ready to pay it?

18:28.775 --> 18:31.986
(tense music playing)

18:36.866 --> 18:40.078
Valya:
<i>Tula, I received
word of Lila's death.</i>

18:40.912 --> 18:42.831
I know you must
be heartbroken.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.251
She was a very brave
young woman.

18:47.544 --> 18:48.962
(exhales)

18:49.796 --> 18:51.798
You'll never guess
where I am.

18:53.008 --> 18:55.010
But desperate times...

18:59.180 --> 19:00.431
(sighs)

19:00.432 --> 19:03.225
I feel haunted,
Tula, by our past.

19:03.226 --> 19:05.937
I can't escape it.
Not even in my sleep.

19:09.274 --> 19:12.652
I had a dream,
like Kasha.

19:15.030 --> 19:16.031
(Valya softly gasps)

19:20.910 --> 19:23.872
I could use you here
if you can--

19:28.126 --> 19:29.294
(cracks, pieces clatter)

19:32.255 --> 19:34.174
Sister Theodosia:
We got word from
Sister Mikaela.

19:34.883 --> 19:36.925
The attack is
moving forward
as planned.

19:36.926 --> 19:39.345
They're targeting
the Emperor's speech.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.929
Let them.

19:40.930 --> 19:44.266
Once I save
the Emperor's life
in full view,

19:44.267 --> 19:46.018
we'll be back
in his good graces.

19:46.019 --> 19:49.481
And what good is that
if Desmond Hart still lives?

19:50.398 --> 19:52.108
(sighs)

19:52.108 --> 19:55.820
It's not wise
to attack an enemy you
don't understand head-on.

19:58.365 --> 20:02.577
First, take out its limbs...
diminish its strength.

20:03.495 --> 20:07.123
And give yourself time
to understand its weaknesses.

20:07.123 --> 20:09.584
The rebels are using
a thinking machine.

20:10.585 --> 20:12.629
If you fail
to destroy it,

20:12.629 --> 20:17.676
you and the Emperor
and everyone else
in that room will die.

20:21.012 --> 20:22.097
(squishes)

20:22.847 --> 20:25.183
I won't fail.

20:30.021 --> 20:31.230
I will destroy
the machine

20:31.231 --> 20:33.733
as soon as
the Atreides boy
releases it.

20:34.192 --> 20:36.861
And then I will deliver him
as a traitor to the Emperor.

20:37.696 --> 20:39.905
But first,
we need to get
my nephew out there

20:39.906 --> 20:42.241
- on the High Council.
- How?

20:42.242 --> 20:44.327
It wasn't us
that put the rumor

20:44.327 --> 20:47.288
about Pruwet Richese
into play,
but play it we will.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.416
(indistinct chatter)

20:50.417 --> 20:53.461
(tense music playing)

20:57.048 --> 20:58.717
Lord Hagal:
Take the machine.

21:01.553 --> 21:04.096
Sister, is there a problem?

21:04.097 --> 21:06.808
My Lord,
about the Richese boy.

21:12.355 --> 21:14.189
Is there truth
in this rumor
of the boy's death?

21:14.190 --> 21:18.110
Our Mentats calculate
the odds of immolation
by toy malfunction

21:18.111 --> 21:21.113
at one in 2.5 million.

21:21.114 --> 21:24.826
- So, it was a cover-up.
- Difficult to fully assess.

21:25.577 --> 21:28.371
House Richese
is refusing
an investigation.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.789
(softly)
Are you suggesting
they were threatened?

21:30.790 --> 21:32.083
Uncertain.

21:33.501 --> 21:35.586
But to launch
a formal inquiry

21:35.587 --> 21:38.422
is within the power
of the Great Houses.

21:38.423 --> 21:42.217
And if that inquiry
yields no wrongdoing
by the Emperor...

21:42.218 --> 21:44.595
Then it could be
perceived that

21:44.596 --> 21:46.388
whomever lodged
the accusation

21:46.389 --> 21:48.266
is challenging his rule.

21:48.933 --> 21:53.395
A treasonous act.
Our house cannot
suffer such a risk.

21:53.396 --> 21:55.397
But you're right
about the precedent.

21:55.398 --> 21:57.107
The Emperor
can't be given

21:57.108 --> 21:59.151
the power to punish
any house on a whim.

21:59.152 --> 22:02.988
Perhaps...
you could
sway a house

22:02.989 --> 22:05.825
whose gain
outweighs the risks.

22:07.118 --> 22:08.661
What house would be
so desperate?

22:09.621 --> 22:11.789
A lesser house.

22:11.790 --> 22:14.333
A disgraced house.

22:14.334 --> 22:18.420
A house with
an over-eager baron.
