WEBVTT

01:00.144 --> 01:02.510
You must declare all items.

01:02.580 --> 01:04.741
Undeclared items will be confiscated.

01:04.816 --> 01:06.977
Cho, declare the ginseng to customs.

01:07.051 --> 01:10.077
Why, Pop? They make us pay 50 bucks in
duty.

01:10.154 --> 01:12.054
I know.

01:12.123 --> 01:13.522
- What if I just hide it in my
pants?

01:13.591 --> 01:14.956
They'll never know.

01:15.026 --> 01:16.618
- Brilliant, Fei-
Hong.

01:16.694 --> 01:18.025
Better yet, why don't we have the master
hold onto it?

01:18.096 --> 01:19.028
They'll never search him,

01:19.097 --> 01:20.029
because he's
too respectable.

01:20.098 --> 01:21.030
What do you think?

01:21.099 --> 01:22.157
- Ha ha ha! Very
good idea.

01:22.233 --> 01:23.427
You're hopeless... both of you.

01:23.501 --> 01:24.832
- Bad
idea.

01:24.903 --> 01:26.894
I'll not hear any more of your nonsense.

01:26.971 --> 01:27.938
I just don't understand

01:28.006 --> 01:28.938
why we have to pay duties-

01:29.007 --> 01:30.269
on everything we buy?

01:30.341 --> 01:32.400
I don't care what you say. Just listen
to me.

01:32.477 --> 01:34.308
Avoid trouble. Pay the duties, that's it.

01:34.379 --> 01:35.311
I know best.

01:41.386 --> 01:42.444
Soldier: Back, back.

01:42.520 --> 01:45.717
Back. Make way. Let the ambassador
through.

01:45.790 --> 01:47.985
What's going on?

01:48.059 --> 01:49.083
Now watch it.

01:49.160 --> 01:50.184
It's the ambassador,

01:50.261 --> 01:51.694
and he deserves respect.

01:51.763 --> 01:53.162
He's treated like royalty.

01:53.231 --> 01:54.596
He doesn't have to pay any duties.

01:54.666 --> 01:55.963
How about that one?

01:56.034 --> 01:57.467
Wow. He's a lucky one.

02:02.740 --> 02:05.106
No pushing. Don't push.

02:05.176 --> 02:06.643
Everybody back.

02:06.711 --> 02:08.008
Let these people through!

02:08.079 --> 02:09.568
Ay!

02:10.715 --> 02:13.115
Oh, no. Hey, are you all right?

02:13.184 --> 02:14.742
Let's go. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

02:16.754 --> 02:18.585
What happened?

02:18.656 --> 02:19.714
Shut up. Someone push him.

02:19.791 --> 02:20.780
Huh?

02:20.858 --> 02:22.485
Please, sir, I apologise.

02:22.560 --> 02:23.584
Listen, Fei-Hong.

02:23.661 --> 02:25.390
Fei-Hong, why did you give him our ginseng?

02:25.463 --> 02:26.555
So we don't have to pay tax.

02:26.631 --> 02:28.258
Once we get on the train, I'll look for the box.

02:28.333 --> 02:29.766
Ah, what a terrific idea.

02:29.834 --> 02:30.766
What's that?

02:30.835 --> 02:31.767
You could throw me down again

02:31.836 --> 02:32.825
and I'll hide some more.

02:32.904 --> 02:33.836
Here I go. Here I go.

02:33.905 --> 02:34.929
Aah!

02:35.006 --> 02:36.439
Ooh.

02:37.742 --> 02:38.674
He must've tripped.

02:38.743 --> 02:39.675
Look atyou.
You're so clumsy.

02:39.744 --> 02:41.837
Come on, get up.

02:41.913 --> 02:42.937
File in!

02:47.385 --> 02:48.852
Wow, what a crowd.

02:48.920 --> 02:49.887
Why don't you go get a seat-

02:49.954 --> 02:51.012
and I'll pay the taxes?

02:51.089 --> 02:52.147
All right, son.

02:52.223 --> 02:53.588
I'll see you on board.

02:53.658 --> 02:55.421
If you have nothing to declare,

02:55.493 --> 02:57.120
begin boarding right now.

03:05.770 --> 03:06.930
Here, Fei-Hong, take this.

03:07.005 --> 03:07.937
Got it.

03:10.008 --> 03:11.441
Come on.

03:13.211 --> 03:15.372
Fei-Hong, great.

03:16.781 --> 03:18.749
Easy, easy.

03:18.816 --> 03:19.874
Be careful. You'll crush everything.

03:19.951 --> 03:21.213
That's good.

03:21.285 --> 03:22.718
Hold it.

03:24.122 --> 03:25.749
Hey, where are you going? Stop!

03:25.823 --> 03:27.620
Come back! Fei-Hong!

03:29.661 --> 03:31.720
Fei-Hong, let him go!

03:33.698 --> 03:35.256
Fei-Hong, forget about him!

03:35.333 --> 03:37.528
Come back here. Come back.

03:39.303 --> 03:40.668
Fei-Hong,

03:40.738 --> 03:42.433
now, let me remind you.

03:42.507 --> 03:44.873
A hero lives but a few seconds.

03:44.942 --> 03:46.307
A master holds onto his life.

03:46.377 --> 03:47.640
But he stole your wallet.

03:47.773 --> 03:49.536
And I took it back.

03:49.609 --> 03:50.701
That's not the issue.

03:50.776 --> 03:52.403
The point is, the stronger man knows...

03:52.478 --> 03:55.038
It's more important to forgive than it
is to fight.

03:55.114 --> 03:56.046
That's right.

03:56.115 --> 03:57.275
What was I thinking?

04:18.027 --> 04:18.959
Uhh.

04:19.028 --> 04:20.392
Your turn.

04:20.463 --> 04:21.793
How about this?

04:21.863 --> 04:25.231
Hey, you know better than that.

04:25.301 --> 04:28.498
But there's no other move.

04:28.571 --> 04:30.835
Try it again.

04:30.907 --> 04:32.807
Try it again.

04:32.875 --> 04:35.036
Hey, look at the white crane.

04:35.111 --> 04:37.443
Wow. Have you ever seen one like that?

04:37.513 --> 04:40.175
It's still your play.

04:40.249 --> 04:41.477
Come on.

04:41.551 --> 04:44.042
Can we start over?

04:44.120 --> 04:45.280
You still have a chance.

04:45.355 --> 04:46.686
Where? I don't see it.

04:46.756 --> 04:48.815
It's not fair. You always win.

04:48.891 --> 04:50.449
Ready?

04:50.526 --> 04:51.823
Oh, God!

04:51.894 --> 04:54.294
Damn it!

04:57.467 --> 04:58.456
Uhh...

04:58.534 --> 05:00.365
Are you OK?

05:00.436 --> 05:01.300
Oh...

05:01.371 --> 05:03.396
I bet that hurt.

05:03.473 --> 05:04.735
I'm sorry, sir.

05:04.807 --> 05:06.570
Is this yours? - I'm afraid so.

05:06.642 --> 05:08.303
Be more careful.

05:08.378 --> 05:09.709
Shh.

05:10.813 --> 05:12.246
Yes, sir.

05:12.315 --> 05:13.247
Ready?

05:13.316 --> 05:14.578
Ready.

05:16.252 --> 05:18.820
Fei-Hong, what's this?

05:18.953 --> 05:20.784
We call it cheating.

05:39.674 --> 05:41.437
You've only got 10 minutes, so hurry up.

05:51.574 --> 05:54.065
Come on, we ain't got all day!

05:55.644 --> 05:57.202
Oh, the ginseng... time to find it.

05:57.279 --> 05:58.507
Oh, yeah. Good idea.

05:58.581 --> 06:00.173
Father, forget about this.

06:00.249 --> 06:01.876
Let me go find something you're really
going to like.

06:01.951 --> 06:04.579
Ha ha. I don't think I'm ready to eat,

06:04.653 --> 06:05.642
but I thank you.

06:05.721 --> 06:07.348
Come on, how about a nice roasted
chicken?

06:07.423 --> 06:08.355
We can find him one.

06:08.424 --> 06:09.584
How about it, huh?

06:09.658 --> 06:11.353
Look, I can see you two want to look
around a bit.

06:11.427 --> 06:12.826
It's OK. I'll be fine here.

06:12.895 --> 06:13.919
Go on. - Come on.

06:16.232 --> 06:17.324
Hey-

06:17.399 --> 06:19.765
you two stay out of trouble, you hear me?

06:19.835 --> 06:21.097
You make sure you come right back.

06:23.939 --> 06:24.963
Pardon me.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.200
Excuse me.

06:26.275 --> 06:27.708
Pardon me.

06:30.713 --> 06:31.680
Sorry, sorry.

06:37.086 --> 06:38.610
God, do you believe the smell of this
place?

06:38.687 --> 06:41.121
I think I'm going to be sick.

06:41.190 --> 06:42.521
God.

06:42.591 --> 06:44.525
Hey, this way.

06:48.931 --> 06:49.863
Wow.

06:51.700 --> 06:53.167
The vegetation's much nicer.

06:53.235 --> 06:54.759
Yes, I see.

06:55.938 --> 06:57.166
It's making me hungry.

06:57.239 --> 06:59.104
Maybe we could grab a roll.

06:59.174 --> 07:00.402
Hey!

07:02.411 --> 07:03.969
What are you doing here?

07:04.046 --> 07:05.172
Nothing. - Nothing.

07:05.247 --> 07:06.305
You think you have reservations?

07:06.382 --> 07:07.781
Yeah, yeah, we do.

07:07.850 --> 07:08.782
Go on back.

07:08.851 --> 07:09.783
Check inside.

07:09.852 --> 07:10.819
I've had enough. Go on.

07:10.886 --> 07:13.719
One more time, and you're off the train.

07:13.789 --> 07:14.915
So what do we do now?

07:14.990 --> 07:15.922
I got an idea.

07:28.237 --> 07:29.169
Now what?

07:29.238 --> 07:30.466
Just watch me.

07:33.709 --> 07:34.835
Go!

07:36.712 --> 07:38.839
Go away! Go away!

07:38.914 --> 07:40.609
Look out!

07:40.683 --> 07:41.650
They've gone wild!

07:46.722 --> 07:48.587
Here. Hold this.

07:48.657 --> 07:50.124
Stop him!

07:52.094 --> 07:54.119
Fire! Fire!

07:56.699 --> 07:58.860
Aah!

08:06.208 --> 08:08.176
Sorry, sir. Huh?

08:08.243 --> 08:09.175
Wait.

08:11.981 --> 08:13.278
Hey!

08:14.850 --> 08:15.874
He...

08:20.422 --> 08:23.357
I'm sure he came this way.

08:26.228 --> 08:28.162
Hey, stop!

08:35.504 --> 08:37.404
Hey, you!

08:37.472 --> 08:39.464
Where you going? - Where you
going?

08:39.541 --> 08:41.030
Hey, you.

08:41.110 --> 08:43.304
Wait. Why you hit...

08:47.549 --> 08:48.709
I kill you! - Oh!

08:52.488 --> 08:53.978
There. Traitor.

08:54.056 --> 08:55.489
A what?

08:58.427 --> 08:59.359
Hot tea, sir?

09:01.463 --> 09:03.192
Hot tea for sale.

09:04.299 --> 09:05.266
Thank you.

09:11.407 --> 09:13.204
You leave me alone!

09:36.498 --> 09:37.590
Yaah!

09:58.087 --> 10:00.078
Next time, I cut your throat...

10:01.557 --> 10:03.024
Traitor.

10:06.795 --> 10:08.023
You.

10:09.431 --> 10:10.796
Hey, listen!

10:12.668 --> 10:14.636
I'm not a traitor, you hear me? You...

10:16.538 --> 10:17.835
Then what are we fighting about?

10:17.906 --> 10:19.897
Don't play games. You hit me.

10:29.551 --> 10:30.813
Yaah!

10:59.081 --> 11:00.275
Where'd he go?

11:04.319 --> 11:05.479
Hey!

11:14.696 --> 11:15.822
Hmm.

11:22.538 --> 11:24.870
Back again? Why don't you give up?

11:24.940 --> 11:26.703
Oh, no, old man. Apologise.

11:26.775 --> 11:28.140
What did you say?

11:28.210 --> 11:30.041
How dare you call me a traitor?

11:31.680 --> 11:33.204
OK. Sorry.

11:33.282 --> 11:34.977
Fine, but I still owe you one.

11:35.050 --> 11:36.449
Here.

11:36.518 --> 11:37.883
Hey, show respect.

11:37.953 --> 11:39.113
Stand still.

11:39.188 --> 11:40.246
Respect to you?

11:40.322 --> 11:43.257
You must be kidding me.

11:46.929 --> 11:48.556
Let's make this fair.

11:52.801 --> 11:53.733
Huhh.

11:53.802 --> 11:55.269
Ready?

12:12.154 --> 12:14.213
Ah, drunken boxing.

12:15.757 --> 12:18.225
That's right. I'm the master.

12:19.661 --> 12:20.821
You think so?

12:20.896 --> 12:21.828
Again.

12:23.732 --> 12:24.664
Come on.

12:24.733 --> 12:26.724
Let's go. - You come.

12:27.970 --> 12:29.528
You know-

12:29.605 --> 12:31.800
a kid like you isn't worth my time.

12:33.041 --> 12:34.133
I show you!

12:34.209 --> 12:36.040
Tiger Slash At Bear!

12:39.348 --> 12:40.315
Quail!

12:41.617 --> 12:42.606
Huh?

12:46.288 --> 12:47.812
What do you call that one?

12:50.058 --> 12:52.458
Ha. It's called Turtle Holding Wild Bear.

12:54.196 --> 12:55.857
Catch the Bouquet!

12:55.931 --> 12:57.899
Eagle Catch the Rabbit!

13:01.737 --> 13:03.136
Down the Hatch!

13:05.240 --> 13:07.504
Hmm. - Drunk Plays the Flute?

13:07.576 --> 13:09.669
* Da da da da da da da *

13:09.745 --> 13:12.009
Fei-Hong::
**Lala la la la la la**

13:12.080 --> 13:13.843
**Deela da da
la la la la la la--**

13:13.916 --> 13:15.611
Uhh.

13:15.684 --> 13:16.742
And this one?

13:18.987 --> 13:20.545
Nursing a Hangover.

13:20.622 --> 13:22.613
OK-

13:22.691 --> 13:23.817
stand up.

13:29.364 --> 13:30.695
Your kung fu is pretty good.

13:30.766 --> 13:33.064
Young man, you're not too bad yourself,

13:33.135 --> 13:34.261
but that drunken boxing wasn't...

13:35.337 --> 13:36.964
Impressed?

13:37.039 --> 13:39.974
Basically, it's slow, and you have no
power.

13:40.042 --> 13:41.703
It's pathetic.

13:41.777 --> 13:43.711
What?

13:43.779 --> 13:46.577
I can defeat any kung fu. I show you
power.

13:46.648 --> 13:48.809
That's nice, but you're out of time.

13:48.884 --> 13:50.249
Time? I'm young and strong.

13:50.319 --> 13:51.251
I've got lots of time.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.811
But your train's leaving over there.

13:53.889 --> 13:56.449
Nice try, old man, but now you're going
to get it.

13:58.060 --> 13:59.186
Ay. All right, kid.

13:59.261 --> 14:00.353
Come back here!

14:00.429 --> 14:01.599
Oh, no, the train!

14:05.837 --> 14:07.805
Wait for me!

14:12.810 --> 14:14.641
Come on, give me your hand.

14:20.018 --> 14:21.542
Hey, thanks a lot.

14:21.619 --> 14:23.553
Get what you were after?

14:25.623 --> 14:27.113
Good fortune to you!

14:27.191 --> 14:28.658
Ah, the ginseng.

14:31.396 --> 14:32.328
Ah.

14:35.700 --> 14:36.826
Ginseng?

14:41.973 --> 14:44.806
All right, everyone here get up.

14:44.876 --> 14:47.310
Gather your luggage for inspection.

14:47.378 --> 14:49.846
Everyone, now. Come on.

14:51.816 --> 14:53.044
You.

14:53.117 --> 14:54.641
Wake up.

14:54.719 --> 14:55.981
Good morning.

14:56.054 --> 14:57.112
What are you doing?

14:57.188 --> 14:59.588
Something has been stolen,

14:59.657 --> 15:00.919
and we're going to find it.

15:00.992 --> 15:02.687
Guard, -

15:02.760 --> 15:03.692
search them.

15:03.761 --> 15:05.319
All right, what is all that?

15:06.497 --> 15:08.431
You, take it out.

15:08.499 --> 15:09.431
Hurry up.

15:09.500 --> 15:12.128
Cho, open this. Fei-Hong.

15:12.203 --> 15:13.170
Let me see.

15:13.237 --> 15:14.602
Bear claw.

15:14.672 --> 15:16.367
What else? Come on.

15:16.441 --> 15:17.533
Green toad.

15:17.608 --> 15:18.939
Next.

15:19.010 --> 15:19.999
Deer horn, ginseng...

15:20.078 --> 15:23.605
What's that? The one you dropped.

15:23.681 --> 15:24.739
Open that.

15:24.816 --> 15:26.078
This one?

15:26.150 --> 15:27.447
What's that?

15:27.518 --> 15:28.849
Dried yak.

15:28.920 --> 15:30.285
OK, next. - Shit.

15:30.354 --> 15:31.514
Now the other box. Come on.

15:31.589 --> 15:32.521
Let me see the other box.

15:32.590 --> 15:34.182
Acorn.

15:34.258 --> 15:36.249
Not that... that.

15:36.327 --> 15:38.693
Let me see that one.

15:38.763 --> 15:40.822
Not that one. The one over there.

15:40.898 --> 15:41.956
Which one?

15:42.033 --> 15:43.330
On the seat... between you.

15:43.401 --> 15:44.732
This? No, no, no. That one.

15:44.802 --> 15:46.269
He means the ginseng.

15:46.337 --> 15:47.565
He wasn't hiding it.

15:47.638 --> 15:49.299
Well, then open it up.

15:49.373 --> 15:51.136
What are you waiting for?

15:51.209 --> 15:52.141
Open that box!

15:52.210 --> 15:53.142
Right now!

15:53.211 --> 15:54.371
Excuse me, sir-

15:54.445 --> 15:57.039
these gentlemen are clearly physicians
from Hunan.

15:57.115 --> 15:59.015
Why don't you give them a break, huh?

15:59.083 --> 16:01.051
I don't give breaks. I give orders.

16:01.119 --> 16:02.677
Show me your papers.

16:02.754 --> 16:04.244
Come on, let's see them.

16:04.322 --> 16:05.254
Here.

16:07.825 --> 16:09.986
Sir, my apologies.

16:12.563 --> 16:13.791
Shh.

16:13.865 --> 16:14.832
Sir.

16:16.000 --> 16:19.197
He's with Counterintelligence.

16:19.270 --> 16:20.532
He's with the central government.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.402
Better not challenge his authority.

16:22.473 --> 16:23.599
All right, next car.

16:23.674 --> 16:25.301
Search up there. - Next car.

16:27.411 --> 16:28.901
I'm amazed they would think

16:28.980 --> 16:30.242
we would steal anything.

16:30.314 --> 16:31.975
It is such an insult.

16:32.049 --> 16:32.981
Yeah.

16:34.352 --> 16:36.650
Put that away.

16:40.758 --> 16:43.784
Do you all realise what this means?

16:43.861 --> 16:45.829
They certainly won't buy the rest of the
shipment-

16:45.897 --> 16:47.364
without it.

16:49.066 --> 16:50.795
You know, I'm truly astounded

16:50.868 --> 16:53.632
at the incompetence of all of you.

16:53.704 --> 16:55.672
You severely damaged my reputation

16:55.740 --> 16:57.731
with the British Museum of Art.

16:57.809 --> 16:58.901
They've asked me to deliver

16:58.976 --> 17:01.001
the jade seal of the emperor,

17:01.078 --> 17:02.943
and I have every intention

17:03.014 --> 17:04.948
of fulfilling that request.

17:06.517 --> 17:09.611
I don't care how you do it.

17:09.686 --> 17:11.154
I want it back.

17:11.222 --> 17:12.280
Yes, sir.

17:12.356 --> 17:14.050
We think we know who the thief is, sir.

17:14.125 --> 17:15.217
Get him.

17:15.292 --> 17:16.224
Yes, sir.

17:17.328 --> 17:19.296
John-

17:19.363 --> 17:20.421
we're having a bit of trouble

17:20.498 --> 17:22.659
with the workers at the steel factory.

17:22.733 --> 17:24.200
I trust you'll deal with it.

17:24.268 --> 17:25.257
Of course, sir.

17:25.336 --> 17:27.133
I know just what to do in this situation.

17:27.204 --> 17:29.070
I promise you'll have no more trouble.

17:29.140 --> 17:30.129
Let's make sure.

17:30.208 --> 17:31.072
Yes, sir.

17:35.279 --> 17:36.576
Uhh!

17:40.985 --> 17:42.452
Ancestors be blessed.

17:49.660 --> 17:50.592
Ha!

17:51.896 --> 17:53.022
It's grand slam.

17:53.097 --> 17:54.121
Aw...

17:54.198 --> 17:56.428
Ha ha ha!

17:56.500 --> 17:58.695
Let's go, let's go. Come on, come on,
pay up, pay up.

17:58.769 --> 18:00.600
Quickly. We haven't got all day.

18:00.671 --> 18:02.161
Go and see who is at the door.

18:02.240 --> 18:03.605
Come on.

18:03.674 --> 18:05.642
Money. Ha ha ha! That's the way.

18:05.710 --> 18:06.642
More. Now your turn.

18:06.711 --> 18:08.110
Come on.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.079
She wins every turn.

18:11.148 --> 18:12.672
Madam?

18:12.750 --> 18:13.842
The master is back.

18:13.918 --> 18:16.318
Yeah, yeah, the master.

18:16.387 --> 18:18.150
Oh, God, it's my husband!

18:19.390 --> 18:21.221
Hi.

18:21.292 --> 18:22.452
Hello.

18:22.526 --> 18:23.993
What took you so long?

18:24.061 --> 18:26.529
I was in the kitchen.

18:26.597 --> 18:28.121
Uhh. Unh.

18:28.199 --> 18:29.666
Stand back.

18:31.369 --> 18:32.301
Here.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.638
Miss me?

18:36.707 --> 18:39.039
What are you all doing?

18:39.110 --> 18:41.408
Oh, it's you. I'm so glad you're home.

18:41.479 --> 18:42.503
How was your trip?

18:42.580 --> 18:44.172
Is everything all right?

18:44.248 --> 18:45.340
All right?

18:45.416 --> 18:46.849
Um... oh.

18:47.985 --> 18:48.952
Hmm.

18:50.488 --> 18:51.420
More mah-jongg?

18:51.489 --> 18:53.480
Quiet!

18:54.625 --> 18:55.557
How many times have I asked you

18:55.626 --> 18:57.321
not to see patients while I'm away?

18:57.395 --> 18:58.362
You know it's illegal.

18:58.429 --> 19:01.262
Oh, now, I know I'm not supposed to,

19:01.332 --> 19:03.562
and I tried to wait, but I had no idea

19:03.634 --> 19:06.535
when you would return. Besides, if you
were me,

19:06.604 --> 19:08.299
I know you would've done the same thing.

19:09.807 --> 19:11.604
Wow. I bet you won a lot.

19:11.676 --> 19:13.075
Not now.

19:14.412 --> 19:15.538
Perhaps I should examine them.

19:15.613 --> 19:18.207
Uh, oh, it's a female problem.

19:18.282 --> 19:19.715
I can handle it.

19:19.784 --> 19:21.877
Fei-Hong, would you prepare my altar for
me?

19:21.953 --> 19:23.215
All right.

19:23.287 --> 19:24.584
You should wash your hands.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.116
Stop it.

19:27.191 --> 19:30.319
We'll need the altar ladder over here,
please.

19:30.394 --> 19:31.418
Did you remember to water the plants?

19:31.495 --> 19:32.928
Oh, yes. - Excellent.

19:34.832 --> 19:36.265
Thank you.

19:44.208 --> 19:46.301
Hey, Mom, whose money?

19:51.182 --> 19:52.877
Wow.

19:52.950 --> 19:54.542
Son. - Huh?

19:54.618 --> 19:55.550
What was that?

19:55.619 --> 19:57.450
I didn't hear anything.

19:57.521 --> 19:59.648
The altar.

19:59.724 --> 20:00.850
Hmm.

20:00.925 --> 20:02.586
Oh, thanks for coming.

20:02.660 --> 20:04.560
My share. Gimme.

20:05.963 --> 20:06.895
Go. Go.

20:10.901 --> 20:12.698
Hey-

20:12.770 --> 20:14.738
show a little respect.

20:19.577 --> 20:20.976
Now, remember your treatment

20:21.045 --> 20:22.478
next Friday, ladies.

20:22.546 --> 20:25.071
Bring money. Ha ha ha.

20:25.149 --> 20:26.582
Hello, Mrs. Wong.

20:26.650 --> 20:28.379
How are you? Has Master Wong returned?

20:28.452 --> 20:29.714
Yes. He's inside.

20:29.787 --> 20:31.687
Any news about my ginseng?

20:31.756 --> 20:32.688
Did he get it?

20:32.757 --> 20:33.951
Let's ask him. Come in.

20:34.025 --> 20:34.957
Oh, thank you.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.459
Mr. Chan has come for his ginseng.

20:36.527 --> 20:37.960
Ah, Mr. Chan, I'm...

20:38.029 --> 20:39.690
Why are you here so soon?

20:39.764 --> 20:40.788
Fei-Hong.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.230
The ginseng's in the back. - I know.

20:42.299 --> 20:43.664
Let me get it. - Go on.

20:43.734 --> 20:45.895
It's beautiful. I brought you a whole
root.

20:45.970 --> 20:46.959
Wait till you see it.

20:47.038 --> 20:48.335
It's just in back. Some tea?

20:48.406 --> 20:49.600
Ah, you are so kind.

20:49.673 --> 20:51.470
Yes. Please have a seat. I'll be right
back.

20:51.542 --> 20:52.668
Thank you.

20:52.743 --> 20:53.937
I'm getting out of here.

20:54.011 --> 20:55.410
Where are you going? You got to help me
out.

20:55.479 --> 20:57.470
When the master finds out, he'll kill me.

20:57.548 --> 20:58.480
He will not.

20:58.549 --> 20:59.675
Fei-Hong.

20:59.750 --> 21:00.842
What are you doing?

21:00.918 --> 21:02.010
Stepma, come here.

21:03.721 --> 21:04.653
I don't know what to do.

21:04.722 --> 21:05.882
We're in such trouble.

21:05.956 --> 21:07.253
I lost the ginseng on the train.

21:07.324 --> 21:09.986
What? What did you do now?

21:10.061 --> 21:11.028
What'd she say?

21:11.095 --> 21:12.426
OK, OK, OK. Shh.

21:12.496 --> 21:13.793
Please. You got to help us out.

21:13.864 --> 21:15.092
Fei-Hong!

21:15.166 --> 21:16.098
Yes, Dad!

21:16.167 --> 21:17.691
You just go out and serve him tea.

21:17.768 --> 21:19.167
I'll think of something.

21:19.236 --> 21:21.033
I'll leave it up to you two. Coming!

21:21.105 --> 21:23.073
Oh, madam, what should we do about this?

21:23.140 --> 21:25.108
You see that door behind me?

21:25.176 --> 21:26.108
You mean...

21:26.177 --> 21:27.667
In the cabinet. - Sure.

21:27.745 --> 21:28.871
There's a black box. - Oh, yeah?

21:28.946 --> 21:29.913
Look inside it.

21:29.980 --> 21:31.345
Ah, another ginseng. I can't believe it!

21:31.415 --> 21:32.814
Strychnine.

21:32.883 --> 21:34.077
What for? - For you.

21:34.151 --> 21:36.085
Oh, no, madam, please don't tease me
this way!

21:36.153 --> 21:37.085
Who's teasing?

21:41.859 --> 21:43.224
I have your tea, Mr. Chan.

21:43.294 --> 21:44.761
Thank you very much, son.

21:44.829 --> 21:45.761
Enjoy it.

21:55.439 --> 21:57.236
Go, go.

21:57.308 --> 21:59.367
Father, you must be very hot.

21:59.443 --> 22:00.933
Let me help you. - Mr. Chan.

22:01.011 --> 22:01.943
Hmm?

22:03.647 --> 22:04.579
Wow.

22:04.648 --> 22:06.138
It's real.

22:06.217 --> 22:08.048
Now, Mr. Chan, I know you have never seen

22:08.119 --> 22:10.417
a specimen as beautiful as this, have
you?

22:10.488 --> 22:12.251
Oh, and let me tell you... wait till you
see

22:12.323 --> 22:13.585
what happens to you when you take it.

22:13.657 --> 22:14.954
Why, women won't believe the difference

22:15.025 --> 22:16.458
in your performance, and you will owe it

22:16.527 --> 22:18.461
all to the master.

22:18.529 --> 22:20.622
What are you doing with that rutabaga?

22:20.698 --> 22:21.756
Ohh.

22:22.833 --> 22:24.357
Rutabaga?

22:24.435 --> 22:26.335
This is a rutabaga?

22:26.403 --> 22:27.556
You mean it isn't ginseng?

22:27.690 --> 22:29.658
No. - Silly of me.

22:29.725 --> 22:31.750
Of course it isn't ginseng. What I meant
to tell you

22:31.827 --> 22:34.261
was that you should stay away from
rutabagas-

22:34.330 --> 22:35.922
especially big rutabagas like this one-

22:35.998 --> 22:37.329
while you're taking ginseng.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.390
It causes gas and neutralises the effect

22:39.468 --> 22:41.129
or something like that.

22:41.203 --> 22:43.637
Excuse me.

22:43.706 --> 22:44.934
Mr. Chan...

22:45.007 --> 22:48.272
I'm glad she remembered to tell you
about that.

22:48.344 --> 22:49.436
You know, most people don't realise

22:49.511 --> 22:50.842
that when you use ginseng

22:50.913 --> 22:52.540
you should avoid the use of rutabaga,

22:52.615 --> 22:54.207
because they're not a good mix.

22:54.283 --> 22:56.547
Rutabaga, shmutabaga.

22:56.619 --> 22:59.554
Stop that, Fei-Hong!

22:59.622 --> 23:01.613
Hi. Back so soon?

23:01.690 --> 23:03.351
Oh, Lord. Now what?

23:03.425 --> 23:04.722
Good luck, now.

23:04.793 --> 23:05.953
You think this looks like ginseng?

23:06.028 --> 23:08.326
Oh, yeah, it looks just like it.

23:08.397 --> 23:09.329
Where did you find it?

23:11.000 --> 23:11.967
Father's bonsai tree.

23:12.034 --> 23:14.434
What a great idea. Just blame it on Cho.

23:14.503 --> 23:16.300
OK. - Aah!

23:19.141 --> 23:22.304
I'll try to keep your father distracted.

23:23.379 --> 23:25.540
What do you think of this?

23:25.614 --> 23:26.945
Boy, that looks great.

23:27.016 --> 23:27.948
Great. I'm a genius.

23:28.017 --> 23:30.144
Excuse me. May I have a word?

23:31.320 --> 23:32.981
Just a second.

23:33.055 --> 23:34.716
Of course. I can wait.

23:34.790 --> 23:36.189
What is it, dear?

23:36.258 --> 23:37.589
Come. - What?

23:37.660 --> 23:39.321
Come on. Just one minute.

23:39.395 --> 23:41.226
Can't this wait? I'm busy right now.

23:41.296 --> 23:42.228
I'm sorry. I couldn't wait

23:42.297 --> 23:43.423
any longer to tell you.

23:43.499 --> 23:45.933
Fei-Hong is all grown up now.

23:46.001 --> 23:47.525
Someday, he will leave our house.

23:47.603 --> 23:49.400
What? - Oh, you know-

23:49.471 --> 23:51.496
how cute he was when he was little.

23:51.573 --> 23:53.097
But why is it wet?

23:53.175 --> 23:55.166
Let me tell you. I'm glad you asked.

23:55.244 --> 23:57.178
Because it was just picked this morning.

23:57.246 --> 23:58.679
You're really going to enjoy the potency

23:58.747 --> 23:59.679
of this one.

23:59.748 --> 24:00.612
It's really powerful.

24:00.683 --> 24:01.809
You just need a little bit.

24:01.884 --> 24:03.909
A little brother around here could take
his place.

24:03.986 --> 24:05.180
We can talk about this later.

24:05.254 --> 24:06.243
Don't be rude.

24:06.321 --> 24:08.346
Please, or I will never forgive you.

24:08.424 --> 24:10.255
You shouldn't talk that way to me.

24:10.325 --> 24:11.883
Well, you never let me talk.

24:11.960 --> 24:13.257
Honey, not now. Mr. Chan...

24:13.328 --> 24:14.260
Don't you turn your back on me.

24:14.329 --> 24:16.024
OK. Roll it up tight

24:16.098 --> 24:17.190
to keep it nice and fresh

24:17.266 --> 24:18.699
and keep it close to your heart...

24:18.767 --> 24:19.825
Like that.

24:19.902 --> 24:20.960
Remember what I told you and have a nice
day.

24:21.036 --> 24:21.968
Right.

24:22.037 --> 24:23.129
Yes. I really do think

24:23.205 --> 24:24.137
we need to talk about this now.

24:24.206 --> 24:26.140
Master Wong? Thanks for the ginseng.

24:26.208 --> 24:28.039
Ah. Everything is all right?

24:28.110 --> 24:29.577
Just fine.

24:29.645 --> 24:30.771
I'll keep it inside. - He liked it.

24:30.846 --> 24:32.108
Let me see you out.

24:32.181 --> 24:33.273
Let Fei-Hong do it.

24:33.348 --> 24:35.908
I can show you. Please, this way.

24:35.984 --> 24:37.645
Bye-bye, now. - Goodbye, Mr. Chan.

24:37.720 --> 24:39.187
Anyway, as I was saying

24:39.254 --> 24:40.346
before Mr. Chan interrupted us,

24:40.422 --> 24:41.821
it's time you thought about this.

24:41.890 --> 24:43.824
I don't know what you're trying to tell
me.

24:43.892 --> 24:45.359
Mother, Mr. Chan's gone.

24:45.427 --> 24:46.359
Oh, thank God.

24:46.428 --> 24:47.725
What's this all about?

24:47.796 --> 24:49.127
Look, if you don't want to talk about
this

24:49.198 --> 24:50.688
right now, I understand.

24:50.766 --> 24:51.790
You've had a really long trip,

24:51.867 --> 24:52.799
and you should get some rest.

24:52.868 --> 24:53.926
Come on. Let's sit down.

24:54.002 --> 24:55.299
Yes, Father. Please take a rest.

24:55.370 --> 24:56.962
It's a good idea.

24:57.039 --> 24:59.166
I better start taking better care of
myself.

24:59.241 --> 25:01.801
I need to realise I'm not getting any
younger.

25:01.877 --> 25:04.311
Well? Why do you make that look?

25:04.379 --> 25:06.006
Because I'm afraid he'll find the tree.

25:06.081 --> 25:09.016
Don't be silly. Throw the pot away.

25:09.084 --> 25:10.108
That's not all.

25:10.185 --> 25:11.174
What?

25:11.253 --> 25:13.084
What happens when Mr. Chan drinks the tea

25:13.155 --> 25:14.213
made from those roots?

25:14.289 --> 25:16.757
Ho ho ho! So he will get a little dizzy.

25:16.825 --> 25:18.986
He's going to have the time of his
life.

25:19.061 --> 25:20.961
I wish I could say the same.

25:25.033 --> 25:27.331
All right, all right. That's it for
me.

25:27.402 --> 25:28.630
See you tomorrow.

25:28.704 --> 25:31.104
Hey, thanks for bringing it down.

25:31.173 --> 25:32.868
Ho Sang, she's cooling down.

25:32.941 --> 25:33.873
Can you give me some more fire?

25:33.942 --> 25:35.933
Just give me one minute.

25:41.917 --> 25:43.851
Stand back.

25:47.756 --> 25:49.917
That was great. Thanks for the light.

25:49.992 --> 25:51.584
Almost quitting time.

25:54.463 --> 25:56.590
After this, I ought to.

26:00.035 --> 26:01.002
That's it!

26:05.507 --> 26:07.634
See you tomorrow.

26:09.144 --> 26:10.406
Hey!

26:10.479 --> 26:13.141
Get them back to work.

26:13.215 --> 26:14.375
But why?

26:14.449 --> 26:15.677
Go!

26:15.751 --> 26:18.276
I'm the new foreman here. Now ring the
bell.

26:18.353 --> 26:19.820
Go on.

26:19.888 --> 26:21.480
Yes, sir.

26:27.763 --> 26:29.230
Hey, Ho Sang,

26:29.298 --> 26:31.198
what the hell you doing now?

26:31.266 --> 26:32.893
Yeah, what are you, out of your mind?

26:32.968 --> 26:34.401
Sorry.

26:36.772 --> 26:38.637
I was just told that we have a new
foreman here.

26:39.708 --> 26:41.300
New foreman?

26:41.376 --> 26:42.502
Well-

26:43.846 --> 26:45.973
we seem to have fallen behind this month,

26:46.048 --> 26:48.915
so everybody works the night shift

26:48.984 --> 26:50.246
for one month.

26:50.319 --> 26:52.184
What? Extra shifts?

26:54.723 --> 26:56.554
Hey, hold on.

26:56.625 --> 26:58.252
So, let's say we work

26:58.327 --> 27:00.261
all those overtime hours for you-

27:00.329 --> 27:01.626
then we need overtime pay.

27:03.198 --> 27:04.756
Quiet.

27:04.833 --> 27:06.391
You give us no choice.

27:06.468 --> 27:08.026
You either work the overtime,

27:08.103 --> 27:09.570
or we close the steel mill down,

27:09.638 --> 27:11.469
and you'll all be without jobs.

27:11.540 --> 27:13.701
Now, you can take it or leave it.

27:13.775 --> 27:16.710
Mr. Smith, you can't blackmail us anymore.

27:16.778 --> 27:17.904
We worked hard for you,

27:17.980 --> 27:19.470
and now we've had enough!

27:19.548 --> 27:20.572
We quit!

27:23.352 --> 27:24.979
Hold it!

27:25.053 --> 27:27.078
Nobody is to leave.

27:27.155 --> 27:29.089
You'll stay and work.

27:29.157 --> 27:30.146
Do you understand that?

27:30.225 --> 27:32.056
You can take my job,

27:32.127 --> 27:33.389
but you can't run my life!

27:33.462 --> 27:34.690
You think you can make us?

27:34.763 --> 27:36.458
Who you think you are? Let's go!

27:40.636 --> 27:41.625
Don't move!

27:41.703 --> 27:43.102
You're in our way!

27:45.574 --> 27:48.543
All of you, right now! Get back to work!

27:51.346 --> 27:52.278
Strike breaker!

27:52.347 --> 27:53.974
That's enough!

27:54.049 --> 27:55.641
Aah!

27:55.717 --> 27:57.548
Aah!

27:57.619 --> 27:59.052
Free him!

27:59.121 --> 28:00.418
Ahh! Ohh!

28:00.489 --> 28:01.820
Get him!

28:04.826 --> 28:07.056
Aah!

28:09.131 --> 28:11.395
Everyone up! Back to work!

28:11.466 --> 28:13.798
Great!

28:13.869 --> 28:15.996
You see? He's very persuasive.

28:16.071 --> 28:17.561
They're going to get right back to work.

28:17.639 --> 28:18.867
Ha ha ha!

28:18.941 --> 28:20.568
Huhh!

28:20.642 --> 28:22.109
No, again.

28:22.177 --> 28:23.337
Ki-yah! - Huhh!

28:23.412 --> 28:24.674
Ki-yah!

28:24.746 --> 28:26.373
Ki-yah! Ki-yah!

28:26.448 --> 28:28.814
Ki-yah! Ki-yah!

28:28.884 --> 28:30.044
Ki-yah!

28:30.118 --> 28:31.210
Ki-yah!

28:31.286 --> 28:32.548
Ki-yah!

28:32.621 --> 28:34.452
Ki-yah! Ki-yah!

28:34.523 --> 28:36.457
Black Tiger Slash! Ha! Ki-yah!

28:36.525 --> 28:37.992
Ki-yah!

28:38.060 --> 28:40.426
OK, now! Clean!

28:43.198 --> 28:46.167
It's bloody impossible to sleep with all
this noise.

28:46.234 --> 28:48.464
Why don't we just buy it and have it
bulldozed?

28:48.537 --> 28:50.027
You know that we've been through this
before.

28:50.105 --> 28:51.572
Mr. Wong refuses to sell.

28:51.640 --> 28:52.698
It's ruining my life,

28:52.774 --> 28:54.605
so why don't you go and do something
about it?

28:54.676 --> 28:55.734
Yes, sir.

29:11.526 --> 29:13.153
I'll catch you later!

29:13.228 --> 29:15.560
Hey, Fun, you're working too hard.

29:15.630 --> 29:17.996
You need husband to run that snake stand,
huh?

29:18.066 --> 29:19.465
Perfect job for me, huh?

29:19.534 --> 29:20.796
Ha ha ha ha!

29:20.869 --> 29:22.063
A husband, huh?

29:22.137 --> 29:23.764
Yeah. I bet you'd be running away

29:23.839 --> 29:25.431
from these snakes all day.

29:25.507 --> 29:26.633
Come on, now.

29:26.708 --> 29:28.573
Why would I want to pay some lazy man

29:28.643 --> 29:30.008
when I can do it better, huh?

29:30.078 --> 29:32.706
You know, you make good point.

29:32.781 --> 29:34.442
But seriously now, Fun,

29:34.516 --> 29:35.744
you know, you don't have man around,

29:35.817 --> 29:38.342
so I worry about your safety.

29:38.420 --> 29:40.752
Hey, Fun, I've been thinking...

29:40.822 --> 29:41.754
Let me teach you kung fu.

29:41.823 --> 29:43.757
How about drunken boxing?

29:43.825 --> 29:46.157
Where did you get that idea?

29:46.228 --> 29:47.752
No one does that.

29:47.829 --> 29:48.989
If you really want to fight,

29:49.064 --> 29:51.191
I teach you the Choy Li Fu boxing style.

29:51.266 --> 29:53.029
Oh, wise man speak.

29:55.070 --> 29:56.196
What you looking at?

29:56.271 --> 29:58.239
Get back to work.

30:00.042 --> 30:01.304
We've got customers waiting.

30:01.376 --> 30:02.536
They need the help now.

30:02.611 --> 30:03.737
Yellowtail!

30:03.812 --> 30:05.439
Yellowtail? OK.

30:05.514 --> 30:06.769
Drunken boxing.

30:06.903 --> 30:08.495
What does she know anyway?

30:08.571 --> 30:09.731
Hey, Chang Tsan.

30:09.806 --> 30:11.103
Huh?

30:11.174 --> 30:12.106
What, Fei-Hong?

30:12.175 --> 30:13.540
A fillet of salmon

30:13.609 --> 30:17.101
and a pound of fish marrow, OK?

30:17.180 --> 30:18.807
Hey, where are you going?

30:20.383 --> 30:21.350
Really soft skin,

30:21.417 --> 30:22.475
but the meat is tougher.

30:22.552 --> 30:25.146
Hey, Fun, I'm going to need a few things,
OK?

30:25.221 --> 30:26.916
Ohh! - Hi.

30:26.989 --> 30:27.921
Oh, it's getting away.

30:27.990 --> 30:29.252
Oh! Ha ha ha!

30:29.325 --> 30:31.452
One pheasant and two orders of har gow.

30:31.527 --> 30:33.085
Ah, that would've been my choice.

30:33.162 --> 30:35.187
I've been waiting for a long time.

30:36.265 --> 30:37.698
Here. - Thank you.

30:37.767 --> 30:39.166
You want this or not?

30:39.235 --> 30:40.896
I got a customer waiting.

30:40.970 --> 30:42.062
Oh, yeah. I'll be right there.

30:42.138 --> 30:43.298
Oh, Fei-Hong.

30:43.372 --> 30:45.602
I hear drunken boxing is the best.

30:45.675 --> 30:46.972
Would you be able to teach me?

30:47.043 --> 30:48.101
How about it?

30:48.177 --> 30:49.701
Of course. Anytime.

30:49.779 --> 30:50.973
Hey!

30:51.047 --> 30:52.776
How about I bone it for you, eh?

30:52.849 --> 30:54.146
Oh, no. That's all right.

30:54.217 --> 30:55.377
How about later with that?

30:55.451 --> 30:58.943
We're discussing drunken boxing.

30:59.021 --> 31:01.489
Fei-Hong, when do you think you could
teach me?

31:01.557 --> 31:03.582
Anytime would be fine. You just let me
know.

31:03.659 --> 31:05.058
Fun, you need real instructor

31:05.127 --> 31:06.560
to learn how to fight.

31:06.629 --> 31:10.121
Maybe Chang Tsan can give you a lesson.

31:10.199 --> 31:11.791
He doesn't teach the style I like.

31:11.868 --> 31:13.096
It's for fighting.

31:13.169 --> 31:14.830
Drunken master just for show.

31:14.904 --> 31:16.531
You cannot win fight that way.

31:16.606 --> 31:18.767
Forget him. He's jealous.

31:18.841 --> 31:19.830
I like your style.

31:19.909 --> 31:22.070
Fei-Hong, time to admit it.

31:22.144 --> 31:25.307
Your drunken boxing is no match for Choy
Li Fu.

31:25.381 --> 31:27.406
Isn't that right? You agree?

31:27.483 --> 31:29.041
Yeah! Right! That's right.

31:29.118 --> 31:30.551
Master much better.

31:30.620 --> 31:31.609
He knows.

31:31.687 --> 31:33.120
Depends on who's fighting.

31:33.189 --> 31:34.588
What do you say to a challenge, then?

31:34.657 --> 31:36.591
Out of my way.

31:36.659 --> 31:38.786
My Choy Li Fu, your drunken boxing.

31:38.861 --> 31:40.488
And if I lose, you can have your fish

31:40.563 --> 31:43.259
and anything else you want no charge, on
me.

31:43.332 --> 31:44.959
Listen-

31:45.034 --> 31:46.501
you can learn from Fei-Hong.

31:46.569 --> 31:48.628
I don't need your help.

31:50.773 --> 31:52.707
I appreciate the offer,

31:52.775 --> 31:54.037
but there's too many people here,

31:54.110 --> 31:55.236
and somebody could get hurt.

31:55.311 --> 31:57.472
No way, Fei-Hong. You're going to fight
this time.

31:57.546 --> 31:59.377
Attention, everybody!

31:59.448 --> 32:01.211
Listen!

32:01.284 --> 32:03.479
I'm Chang Tsan, and this is Wong Fei-
Hong.

32:03.552 --> 32:04.678
It's your lucky day.

32:04.754 --> 32:07.018
I have challenged him to a fight.

32:07.089 --> 32:08.021
Come on.

32:08.090 --> 32:09.022
I'll hold this.

32:09.091 --> 32:11.184
Remember, it's an exhibition match,

32:11.260 --> 32:12.727
so go on.

32:14.430 --> 32:15.795
Hah! Hah! Hi! Hyah!

32:15.865 --> 32:17.298
Oh.

32:34.717 --> 32:36.116
Drunken boxing.

32:40.189 --> 32:41.520
Haah!

33:11.487 --> 33:12.715
Ah!

33:14.523 --> 33:16.388
OK, OK, that's enough.

33:16.459 --> 33:19.292
All right, that's enough. The winner is
Fei-Hong.

33:19.362 --> 33:21.853
No. Really, it was a draw.

33:21.931 --> 33:22.863
I think Chang Tsan would agree.

33:22.932 --> 33:23.990
It's not over yet.

33:26.535 --> 33:27.832
Fei-Hong!

33:27.903 --> 33:31.134
Yeah, I'm coming! It's my stepma.

33:31.207 --> 33:32.970
- Come on! - I got to go. Thank
you, Fun.

33:33.042 --> 33:35.033
See you tomorrow.

33:35.111 --> 33:36.043
Fish. - Why, thank you.

33:36.112 --> 33:37.477
What do I owe you for this?

33:37.546 --> 33:38.604
You can have it.

33:38.681 --> 33:40.444
Thanks a lot.

33:40.516 --> 33:42.279
Thank you. Excuse me.

33:42.351 --> 33:44.478
Everyone saw it was a draw, right?

33:44.553 --> 33:46.487
OK, OK, show over.

33:48.391 --> 33:50.359
Don't tell me you were fighting for food
again.

33:50.426 --> 33:51.358
Me? No way.

33:51.427 --> 33:52.416
You know your father will kill you

33:52.495 --> 33:53.621
if he hears about it.

33:53.763 --> 33:55.856
How can I replace the ginseng?

33:55.931 --> 33:57.330
Pawn my diamond necklace, that's how.

33:57.400 --> 33:58.367
But, why?

33:58.434 --> 33:59.458
We'll be in big trouble

33:59.535 --> 34:01.730
if Mr. Chan decides to brew that tree
root.

34:01.804 --> 34:02.736
You would do that?

34:02.805 --> 34:05.865
Just remember, you owe me one.

34:05.941 --> 34:06.873
Yeah.

34:08.844 --> 34:11.710
Hey, that's the guy we're looking for.

34:11.781 --> 34:14.875
Stay close to him while I go and get the
boss, OK?

34:14.949 --> 34:16.178
Yes, sir.

34:16.252 --> 34:18.344
Stop here.

34:18.420 --> 34:19.649
Ah, OK, here's the money.

34:19.722 --> 34:21.053
I'm sure they're high quality.

34:21.123 --> 34:22.054
She got them from her husband.

34:22.123 --> 34:25.116
Look, I'm late already. Let's go, OK?

34:25.194 --> 34:27.822
So, was the drought very serious?

34:27.897 --> 34:29.091
In that province,

34:29.165 --> 34:31.099
rice and grain were scarce before there
was a drought.

34:31.167 --> 34:33.601
With no rainfall, there will be no
harvest,

34:33.668 --> 34:34.966
and that is serious.

34:35.036 --> 34:36.197
We must act now.

34:36.272 --> 34:37.398
It's so bad.

34:37.473 --> 34:38.906
They're so poor that some families

34:38.974 --> 34:40.737
have to share a single pair of pants.

34:40.810 --> 34:42.402
Wow. Who gets to wear them?

34:42.478 --> 34:44.411
If you have job, you wear the pants.

34:44.480 --> 34:45.411
Oh, wow.

34:45.481 --> 34:46.607
Hello. Sorry I'm late.

34:46.681 --> 34:49.081
It's all right. How are you?

34:49.150 --> 34:50.208
Good to see you.

34:50.286 --> 34:52.083
Fei-Hong, don't you think we should be
going?

34:52.154 --> 34:54.645
Aren't you meeting my wife for tea?

34:54.723 --> 34:57.157
Oh, no, not mah-jongg again.

34:57.226 --> 34:58.284
How can you say that?

34:58.360 --> 34:59.292
It's our fund-raising meeting,

34:59.361 --> 35:01.226
and you were supposed to remind me.

35:01.297 --> 35:03.026
Oh, I almost forgot. We'd better be
going.

35:03.099 --> 35:04.396
Ah. You don't want to keep them waiting.

35:04.467 --> 35:05.399
You should go.

35:05.468 --> 35:06.400
Of course. You're right.

35:06.469 --> 35:07.663
Bye. - Goodbye.

35:07.736 --> 35:08.668
Good day.

35:08.737 --> 35:09.669
No mah-jongg!

35:09.738 --> 35:11.797
Yes, sir.

35:11.874 --> 35:13.808
This guy over here.

35:15.144 --> 35:16.611
Go tell John.

35:17.847 --> 35:20.008
It's been called to our attention

35:20.082 --> 35:22.448
that Master Wong needs us to lend him
some money.

35:22.518 --> 35:24.782
Oh, no, no, no. That's not for me.

35:24.854 --> 35:26.287
I'm sure I speak for everyone.

35:26.355 --> 35:27.287
We'll just take up a collection.

35:28.424 --> 35:30.255
I don't personally need any of your
money.

35:30.326 --> 35:31.315
It's for the drought victims.

35:31.393 --> 35:32.325
But your wife...

35:32.394 --> 35:34.089
Look, it's nothing to be ashamed of.

35:34.163 --> 35:35.152
This could happen to you.

35:35.231 --> 35:36.664
I say if Mr. Wong needs money...

35:36.732 --> 35:38.563
Nothing right now.

35:38.634 --> 35:39.566
You sure?

35:39.635 --> 35:40.567
You better not have said anything,

35:40.636 --> 35:41.898
you understand?

35:41.971 --> 35:43.370
I won't tell a soul.

35:43.439 --> 35:45.031
Besides, she's the one that talks a lot.

35:45.107 --> 35:46.597
Like you don't?

35:46.675 --> 35:49.576
How dare you say that? I only told my
sister...

35:49.645 --> 35:51.340
Qu doesn't even know I came here.

35:51.413 --> 35:53.608
Whoa, ladies, somebody has been talking.

35:53.682 --> 35:55.775
They always lie to me. Look at their
faces.

35:55.851 --> 35:57.409
Now, that's enough.

35:57.486 --> 35:59.477
Can't we just take a look?

35:59.555 --> 36:00.613
Let's see.

36:00.689 --> 36:01.621
There.

36:01.690 --> 36:03.783
Hey, careful!

36:03.859 --> 36:05.520
Oh, so beautiful.

36:11.967 --> 36:14.128
Oh, don't handle it like that.

36:14.203 --> 36:15.465
And I'm only borrowing the money.

36:15.538 --> 36:16.971
You're going to have to give it back to
me.

36:17.039 --> 36:19.098
I know, I know. I understand.

36:19.175 --> 36:20.506
Come on. Show it to us.

36:20.576 --> 36:21.508
Here.

36:21.577 --> 36:23.067
So, did you get it?

36:23.145 --> 36:24.373
No. I haven't actually seen it,

36:24.446 --> 36:26.004
but I'm sure they have it.

36:26.081 --> 36:27.912
Well, we can't waste any more time.

36:27.983 --> 36:31.146
Grab the seal, and we'll meet you out
front.

36:31.220 --> 36:32.915
OK, grab it, and I'll see you outside.

36:32.988 --> 36:34.979
Oh, you're so lucky.

36:35.057 --> 36:36.422
You're lucky.

36:36.492 --> 36:39.188
Ah, it's so beautiful on you.

36:39.261 --> 36:40.694
Hey, wait!

36:42.031 --> 36:44.090
The necklace is gone.

36:44.166 --> 36:45.758
You've got to learn to speak up.

36:45.834 --> 36:47.699
Stop him!

36:47.770 --> 36:50.261
Stop him!

36:50.339 --> 36:51.863
Stop! Come on!

36:51.941 --> 36:53.374
Let's go!

36:59.481 --> 37:00.539
Huh?

37:00.616 --> 37:02.516
Leave it.

37:04.353 --> 37:05.445
Fei-Hong!

37:05.521 --> 37:06.510
It's over there!

37:07.990 --> 37:09.617
He went that way! Go!

37:09.692 --> 37:10.852
Excuse me!

37:10.926 --> 37:11.915
Excuse me!

37:23.005 --> 37:23.937
You better run.

37:24.006 --> 37:25.564
Fei-Hong, you're my hero!

37:25.641 --> 37:28.872
Oh, you are a hero.

37:28.944 --> 37:30.070
Hey, Fei-Hong.

37:30.145 --> 37:31.077
You see that?

37:31.146 --> 37:32.807
Atta way.

37:36.952 --> 37:38.044
What's this?

37:38.120 --> 37:39.144
You bumped me.

37:39.221 --> 37:41.451
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

37:41.523 --> 37:42.785
No. That's not good enough.

37:44.193 --> 37:45.125
Did I miss something?

37:45.194 --> 37:47.458
Get on your knees and bow... right now.

37:47.529 --> 37:49.463
What? You must be out of your mind.

37:49.531 --> 37:50.520
Leave him alone.

37:50.599 --> 37:52.794
You were in on it. I saw the whole thing.

37:52.868 --> 37:54.392
Why don't you mind your own business,
bitch?

37:54.470 --> 37:56.335
Hey, who you calling bitch?

37:56.405 --> 37:57.633
I can't let him get away with that.

37:57.706 --> 37:59.037
And who the hell do you think you are

37:59.108 --> 38:00.632
strutting around here like a peacock

38:00.709 --> 38:02.233
in that bad English suit of yours?

38:02.311 --> 38:03.746
I think I should kick your ass.

38:03.880 --> 38:04.744
Oh, yeah?

38:04.814 --> 38:05.906
Wait! Uhh!

38:05.982 --> 38:07.006
Uhh.

38:07.083 --> 38:08.072
Mom, are you all right?

38:08.151 --> 38:09.118
Go away.

38:09.185 --> 38:11.244
I want this guy. I can taste it.

38:11.320 --> 38:13.049
Hey, hey, take it easy. You'll be OK.

38:13.122 --> 38:14.646
Oh, she wants to fight?

38:14.724 --> 38:15.748
We'll take the two of you.

38:15.825 --> 38:18.123
What? You're going to start this again?

38:19.829 --> 38:20.761
What'd you say?

38:20.830 --> 38:22.058
I said, kick his ass!

38:22.131 --> 38:23.155
You want me to go kick...

38:23.232 --> 38:25.166
You will, or I will.

38:25.234 --> 38:26.166
All right.

38:26.235 --> 38:27.668
Oh, what happened?

38:27.737 --> 38:28.669
I'm all right.

38:33.976 --> 38:36.171
He's a very good fighter.

38:36.245 --> 38:38.338
The necklace is inside. It's going to be
ruined!

38:38.414 --> 38:39.381
The necklace?

38:39.448 --> 38:41.643
Fei-Hong! Over here, Fei- Hong!

38:41.717 --> 38:43.241
Here.

38:52.728 --> 38:56.220
Where'd he learn to do that?

38:56.299 --> 38:57.789
Po Chi Lam.

38:57.867 --> 38:59.528
He does drunken boxing, doesn't he?

38:59.602 --> 39:00.899
Oh, well, then, maybe he'll give us

39:00.970 --> 39:03.837
an exhibition on drunken boxing.

39:03.906 --> 39:05.237
All right.

39:05.308 --> 39:08.277
Whatever you want. Fei-Hong! Come here!

39:10.913 --> 39:12.380
All right-

39:12.448 --> 39:14.040
time for drunken boxing.

39:14.116 --> 39:15.344
What about Father?

39:15.418 --> 39:16.350
I'll take care of him.

39:16.419 --> 39:18.011
Besides, it will be great publicity

39:18.087 --> 39:19.019
for the school.

39:19.088 --> 39:20.146
Your dad will be happy.

39:20.223 --> 39:21.155
OK.

39:21.224 --> 39:22.657
Drunken boxing!

39:22.725 --> 39:25.125
All right, what are you scared of?

39:25.194 --> 39:26.491
Four of you guys can't beat one?

39:39.508 --> 39:40.770
Get him!

39:40.843 --> 39:42.276
Waah!

39:53.089 --> 39:54.147
What is that, huh?

39:54.223 --> 39:55.155
It's drunken boxing.

39:55.224 --> 39:56.156
Oh.

39:56.225 --> 39:57.157
Come on, now. What do you think?

39:57.226 --> 39:58.158
Well, can he do more?

39:58.227 --> 39:59.524
Of course he can. Yeah.

39:59.595 --> 40:01.529
Hey, you're a bunch of fools.

40:01.597 --> 40:02.894
Come on.

40:02.965 --> 40:04.296
Oh. Let's go.

40:04.367 --> 40:05.299
Wait for us.

40:08.037 --> 40:09.231
Take as much as you can carry.

40:09.305 --> 40:10.237
OK.

40:10.306 --> 40:11.534
Hey, who's going to pay for that?

40:11.607 --> 40:13.074
Master Wong's charge account.

40:13.142 --> 40:14.074
All right, then.

40:16.746 --> 40:18.839
Hey, where'd they go?

40:18.915 --> 40:19.904
Over there, I think.

40:19.982 --> 40:21.745
Let's go. - Wait for us! Hurry, ladies!

40:24.787 --> 40:25.981
What are they doing?

40:26.055 --> 40:27.181
What's that?

40:27.256 --> 40:28.655
Don't know.

40:30.293 --> 40:32.420
Oh! I'm going to call the police.

40:32.495 --> 40:33.553
Don't do that.

40:33.629 --> 40:36.723
Fei-Hong, I brought you some help.

40:36.799 --> 40:37.731
But Father will kill me.

40:37.800 --> 40:39.700
You can blame it all on me.

40:39.769 --> 40:40.736
You're going to lose if you don't,

40:40.803 --> 40:41.735
so just go ahead.

40:43.072 --> 40:44.039
Yeah.

40:47.476 --> 40:49.137
Here you go... another bottle.

40:52.448 --> 40:54.916
Aah!

40:54.984 --> 40:57.384
Two at once?

40:57.453 --> 40:59.580
Do you think that's a good idea?

40:59.655 --> 41:00.917
Don't worry. It gives him power.

41:04.093 --> 41:07.392
Yaah!

41:18.741 --> 41:20.231
Ow!

41:20.309 --> 41:21.503
Ow!

41:26.082 --> 41:27.014
Uhh!

41:31.387 --> 41:32.319
Ohh!

41:34.690 --> 41:36.123
Are you all right?

41:36.192 --> 41:38.023
What?

41:39.562 --> 41:41.052
One more drink would be helpful.

41:42.698 --> 41:43.790
Here is the very last bottle.

41:54.210 --> 41:55.370
Yii!

41:55.444 --> 41:56.376
You, get up!

42:04.153 --> 42:05.518
Ow! What the hell was that?

42:07.423 --> 42:08.355
What does it mean

42:08.424 --> 42:09.482
when there's a picture of a skull?

42:09.558 --> 42:12.049
Oh. Good stuff.

42:22.838 --> 42:24.465
The last one really hit the spot.

42:24.540 --> 42:25.472
Whoo!

42:32.314 --> 42:34.680
Monkey Drinks Master's Wine.

42:41.123 --> 42:42.818
That was Crazy Corkscrew

42:42.892 --> 42:43.950
Open Wine Bottle.

42:45.194 --> 42:47.628
White Tiger Washes Face.

42:49.565 --> 42:51.032
Turn the Barrel!

42:52.234 --> 42:53.565
What's wrong? You have a hangover?

42:53.636 --> 42:54.967
Kill him!

42:55.037 --> 42:56.800
Do you like Drunken Monkey?

42:58.240 --> 42:59.172
Ee-hee!

42:59.241 --> 43:00.765
Ay!

43:02.745 --> 43:04.542
Ah, Eagle Carries Wine Bottle.

43:04.613 --> 43:05.545
Got you now!

43:08.751 --> 43:10.275
Attack! Waterfall!

43:11.654 --> 43:13.815
That one there, I showed him.

43:13.889 --> 43:16.289
Here is Peter Piper Playing the Flute.

43:16.358 --> 43:17.825
Mmm! Ooh! Ha ha ha!

43:17.893 --> 43:20.054
Oh, that's a good one.

43:24.800 --> 43:26.631
Down the Hatch!

43:28.104 --> 43:30.004
Wheelbarrow.

43:34.110 --> 43:35.668
Ahh!

43:35.744 --> 43:38.304
Drunken Maid Flirting With the Master.

43:41.250 --> 43:42.683
Aah! - Snake Eyes.

43:52.828 --> 43:53.760
Ohh!

43:53.829 --> 43:55.592
And this one?

43:55.664 --> 43:57.564
Uh, Gypsy Wine.

43:57.633 --> 43:59.100
It's called Gypsy what?

43:59.168 --> 44:00.567
Just watch.

44:00.636 --> 44:01.967
Aah!

44:03.072 --> 44:05.233
Uncle Stirs the Barrel.

44:14.717 --> 44:16.480
Come back!

44:16.552 --> 44:17.484
Fei-Hong!

44:17.553 --> 44:18.520
He can't even stand up straight!

44:18.587 --> 44:19.679
Find some more wine.

44:19.755 --> 44:20.687
Of course.

44:20.756 --> 44:21.688
Aah!

44:21.757 --> 44:23.588
Master Wong! What's going on here?

44:23.659 --> 44:26.287
Those men are attacking Fei-Hong!

44:26.362 --> 44:28.091
Hold this. Fei-Hong!

44:29.765 --> 44:30.697
Fei-Hong!

44:30.766 --> 44:32.199
Smash Bottle Against the Wall!

44:34.236 --> 44:37.103
Oh, no!

44:37.173 --> 44:39.198
Fei-Hong!

44:39.275 --> 44:41.038
Ha ha! - Have you been drinking?

44:42.811 --> 44:44.574
You stop it right now!

44:46.549 --> 44:48.176
Down the Hatch!

44:51.086 --> 44:52.018
What are you doing?

44:52.087 --> 44:53.884
Uh, Father?

44:56.158 --> 44:59.025
Ohh...

44:59.094 --> 45:01.654
Ha ha! You have the cutest little nose.

45:04.433 --> 45:06.333
Look how well they get along.

45:06.402 --> 45:08.734
How are you, Dad?

45:08.804 --> 45:10.066
Fighting again!

45:10.139 --> 45:11.629
Fighting? OK.

45:11.707 --> 45:13.504
You should have been here.

45:13.576 --> 45:15.271
Fei-Hong defeated all five of those
gangsters.

45:15.344 --> 45:17.175
What was this all about?

45:17.246 --> 45:18.679
They tried to steal the diamond necklace

45:18.747 --> 45:19.907
that Ling sold to me.

45:19.982 --> 45:21.574
What?

45:21.650 --> 45:23.777
You sold your diamond necklace?

45:23.852 --> 45:26.343
Why didn't you tell us Po Chi Lam needed
more money?

45:26.422 --> 45:28.617
We would have helped you. You know we're
all friends here.

45:28.691 --> 45:31.524
No. The school doesn't need money.

45:31.594 --> 45:33.926
Here, you can take charge of the funds
we raised.

45:35.831 --> 45:38.527
Stop that! Fei-Hong!

45:39.602 --> 45:41.069
Hi. - Hello, Madam Wong.

45:41.136 --> 45:42.433
I said stop it!

45:42.504 --> 45:44.267
No, please, Master Wong, don't hurt him!

45:44.340 --> 45:45.307
He's drunk!

45:45.374 --> 45:47.308
Mom, fetch me another bottle.

45:47.376 --> 45:48.604
Go home now!

45:48.677 --> 45:49.974
Now!

45:50.045 --> 45:52.036
Yes, dear.

45:52.114 --> 45:55.709
Do as he says. All right.

45:55.784 --> 45:56.910
See you.

45:56.986 --> 46:02.686
Go home now, Daddy

46:02.758 --> 46:06.592
Go on. Follow him!

46:06.662 --> 46:08.095
Losers.

46:08.163 --> 46:09.665
You didn't do any better.

46:09.799 --> 46:11.426
And what were you trying to do?

46:11.500 --> 46:13.331
You've ruined the school's reputation!

46:13.402 --> 46:14.528
They think we're broke!

46:14.603 --> 46:16.969
And you, you idiot, what have I told you

46:17.039 --> 46:19.803
about drunken boxing and fighting in the
streets?

46:19.875 --> 46:22.708
Now, tell me, is everything here so bad

46:22.778 --> 46:24.006
you have to sell your diamonds?

46:24.080 --> 46:25.843
Come on! Do you really think

46:25.915 --> 46:27.507
I would have sold something

46:27.583 --> 46:28.982
that's precious to us? I would never!

46:29.051 --> 46:31.246
Don't lie to me!

46:31.320 --> 46:33.345
How much money did you lose playing mah-
jongg?

46:33.422 --> 46:34.616
Well, how much?

46:36.025 --> 46:38.459
I always win at mah-jongg.

46:38.527 --> 46:39.858
You don't know what you're talking about.

46:39.929 --> 46:41.362
Besides, who are you going to believe,

46:41.430 --> 46:42.397
me or friends?

46:42.465 --> 46:44.797
Stepma, I believe you.

46:44.867 --> 46:46.835
Shut up!

46:46.902 --> 46:49.166
Did you hear what I told you? Shut up!

46:49.238 --> 46:50.671
You disobeyed me!

46:50.740 --> 46:53.208
I said absolutely no fighting and no
drinking.

46:53.275 --> 46:55.743
And above all, no drunken boxing!

46:57.213 --> 46:59.704
You even fought with me, your own father!

46:59.782 --> 47:01.807
You disgraced your family name!

47:01.884 --> 47:03.715
Wait! Wait! Hold on!

47:03.786 --> 47:04.718
Would you stop hitting him?

47:04.787 --> 47:06.186
He was just defending me!

47:06.255 --> 47:07.688
They tried to break my jaw.

47:07.757 --> 47:09.281
I guess that's something you don't care
about.

47:09.358 --> 47:12.657
Damn you, woman! It was forbidden!

47:12.728 --> 47:14.787
They could have killed him. Don't you
care about that?

47:14.864 --> 47:17.697
Oh, sure. Like it matters.

47:17.767 --> 47:20.861
You're beating him worse than those guys
ever did.

47:20.936 --> 47:23.700
You're driving me insane!

47:25.441 --> 47:27.432
I can't believe this!

47:33.048 --> 47:34.208
What's this?

47:34.283 --> 47:36.217
Oh, my God!

47:36.285 --> 47:40.585
What has happened to my 300- year-old
bonsai?

47:40.656 --> 47:42.283
Damn it! I forgot to throw it out!

47:42.358 --> 47:43.757
Mr. Cho!

47:43.826 --> 47:45.726
Aah!

47:45.795 --> 47:47.695
What went wrong?

47:47.763 --> 47:50.163
You know this garden is your
responsibility

47:50.232 --> 47:52.325
and I expect an answer! Well?

47:52.401 --> 47:54.562
Just hold on!

47:54.637 --> 47:56.969
You shouldn't blame everything on him
that way,

47:57.039 --> 48:00.008
because I was actually the one who did
it.

48:00.075 --> 48:02.441
I was practising my kung fu

48:02.511 --> 48:05.139
and then I tripped over that statue
right over there.

48:05.214 --> 48:07.409
Luckily, the tree was there to grab.

48:07.483 --> 48:09.144
God only knows, I could have gotten
killed,

48:09.218 --> 48:11.516
but I see now you don't care. Oh, well.

48:11.587 --> 48:13.953
You know that's not it, Ling.

48:14.023 --> 48:15.718
I am so sick and tired of your deception!

48:15.791 --> 48:18.521
If you're going to hit me, just go on.

48:20.963 --> 48:23.761
You know, that's not a bad idea.

48:23.833 --> 48:25.198
It's time you showed me respect.

48:28.671 --> 48:29.865
That's not gonna work this time!

48:34.376 --> 48:39.279
You've been hurting me so I won't cause
any more trouble.

48:39.348 --> 48:40.838
You're driving me out of my mind!

48:40.916 --> 48:43.476
Aah!

48:43.552 --> 48:45.986
Hit me! Hit me all right!

48:46.055 --> 48:47.044
Over the head! Kill me!

48:47.122 --> 48:48.987
Kill me and the little one inside me!

48:49.058 --> 48:51.185
Little one?

48:51.260 --> 48:52.284
Is that so?

48:52.361 --> 48:53.885
We're going to have a baby?

48:55.931 --> 48:57.762
Why didn't you tell me?

48:57.833 --> 48:59.528
Never! - Come inside.

48:59.602 --> 49:01.661
You told me to get on my knees, so here
I am!

49:01.737 --> 49:05.468
On my knees! It doesn't matter if I'm
pregnant!

49:05.541 --> 49:08.772
Mom has a little baby!

49:08.844 --> 49:10.641
I apologise. I wouldn't hit you.

49:10.713 --> 49:12.613
Get away! You said enough!

49:12.681 --> 49:15.047
Ling, no! You will hurt the baby!

49:15.117 --> 49:17.585
Then put me down! - OK.

49:17.653 --> 49:18.745
Leave me alone, I said!

49:18.821 --> 49:21.415
No! You have to stop this!

49:21.490 --> 49:23.048
All right, I will.

49:23.125 --> 49:24.183
Are you all right?

49:24.260 --> 49:25.693
There's no way I'll forgive you!

49:25.761 --> 49:27.228
What are you doing?

49:27.296 --> 49:29.787
This is all my fault. Please be careful.

49:29.865 --> 49:31.264
Get Madam a chair! Quickly!

49:31.333 --> 49:33.130
What are you waiting for?

49:33.202 --> 49:34.635
I'm begging you, Ling.

49:34.703 --> 49:36.432
Sit over there, you'll be all right.

49:36.505 --> 49:39.167
Aah! - Ling!

49:39.241 --> 49:41.072
Oh! Sorry.

49:42.144 --> 49:43.338
Ling, I'm so sorry.

49:43.412 --> 49:44.572
How dare you?!

49:44.647 --> 49:47.616
Oh, it was an accident, Ling.

49:47.683 --> 49:48.615
Let me help you.

49:48.684 --> 49:49.844
You did it on purpose.

49:49.919 --> 49:51.250
Now, of course I didn't.

49:51.320 --> 49:54.448
Don't lie. Haven't you done enough?

49:54.523 --> 49:55.547
Is the baby all right?

49:55.624 --> 49:57.114
Stop it!

49:57.192 --> 50:00.059
Eee. Ooh. Ugh.

50:00.129 --> 50:01.528
It's fine.

50:01.597 --> 50:03.531
Good. Are you comfortable?

50:03.599 --> 50:06.033
Master Wong, Mrs. . Chan is here.

50:06.101 --> 50:07.966
She has a bit of a problem.

50:08.037 --> 50:10.562
You stay right here. I'll be right back.

50:10.639 --> 50:13.767
Congratulations, Father. I'm really
proud of you.

50:13.842 --> 50:16.606
Thank you.

50:16.679 --> 50:18.340
Ah, Mrs. Chan, it's such a pleasure.

50:18.414 --> 50:22.510
Dr. Wong, uh, this really isn't ginseng.

50:22.584 --> 50:25.018
I showed it to another doctor

50:25.087 --> 50:27.055
and he says it's poisonous.

50:27.122 --> 50:29.113
Now, I'm not sure where you got it,

50:29.191 --> 50:30.886
but you've surely been misled.

50:30.960 --> 50:33.394
It has made my husband deathly ill.

50:33.462 --> 50:36.397
Mrs. Thank God he only brewed half
of it.

50:36.465 --> 50:38.990
You owe me, and you're going to have to

50:39.068 --> 50:42.094
take the blame for this mess. Now!

50:42.171 --> 50:43.297
Mm-hmm.

50:43.372 --> 50:46.864
Forgive me. Uncle Ho, get the snake
extract.

50:46.942 --> 50:48.807
I can assure you he will recover

50:48.877 --> 50:50.037
if you give him this.

50:50.112 --> 50:53.081
Ah, Dr. Wong, oh, this is wonderful.

50:53.148 --> 50:54.775
I promise I won't tell anyone.

50:54.850 --> 50:56.909
It must have been a mistake.

50:56.986 --> 50:58.419
Good day, madam.

50:58.487 --> 51:00.717
Mrs. Good day.

51:00.789 --> 51:02.222
Well?

51:02.291 --> 51:04.589
Mmm.

51:04.660 --> 51:05.684
Get over here, Cho!

51:10.232 --> 51:11.164
What's this?

51:11.233 --> 51:14.964
He did it! Fei-Hong!

51:23.412 --> 51:25.676
How could you do such a thing?

51:25.748 --> 51:28.273
Are you out of your mind?

51:29.518 --> 51:32.009
You are destroying my reputation!

51:32.087 --> 51:36.922
Here you go, Father. You dropped your
bonsai tree.

51:36.992 --> 51:39.927
That's it! I'm gonna kill you!

51:39.995 --> 51:42.725
Ruin me! Drunk!

51:42.798 --> 51:44.197
Wait, Wong, don't! Aah!

51:44.266 --> 51:48.032
Hurt my friends! That's it!

51:48.103 --> 51:50.833
Just listen! It was stolen off the train

51:50.906 --> 51:52.703
and he couldn't get it back!

51:52.775 --> 51:55.437
Oh, shit. What am I saying?

51:55.511 --> 51:57.502
See, he was trying to save you some tax.

51:57.579 --> 51:59.979
How would he have known the ginseng
would be stolen?

52:00.049 --> 52:01.983
The ginseng was stolen?

52:02.051 --> 52:04.349
Even so, he still lied to me!

52:04.420 --> 52:06.581
No! Not acceptable!

52:06.655 --> 52:08.088
You shouldn't defend him!

52:08.157 --> 52:10.318
He's a thief and a drunk. Just stay out
of it!

52:10.392 --> 52:11.324
I'm thirsty.

52:11.393 --> 52:12.451
Oh, yeah?

52:12.528 --> 52:16.828
You like some wine? Just stay right
there.

52:24.239 --> 52:27.140
I'll give you some wine. Come on, open
up.

52:29.945 --> 52:31.936
Come on, drink!

52:33.549 --> 52:36.484
Stop it, Wong! Stop!

52:36.552 --> 52:39.146
No more! What are you doing?

52:41.990 --> 52:46.450
Aaah!

52:46.528 --> 52:48.587
You're going to fight me now?

52:48.664 --> 52:50.598
I disown you!

52:50.666 --> 52:53.999
You are not my son!

52:54.069 --> 52:56.469
Now, get out!

52:56.538 --> 52:59.098
You better do as I say!

52:59.174 --> 53:02.371
Get out!

53:02.444 --> 53:06.141
Come on! Get out of here!

53:10.619 --> 53:12.109
Stop it! That's enough!

53:12.187 --> 53:15.384
You're going to kill him!

53:17.559 --> 53:20.392
That's enough, Wong!

53:20.462 --> 53:23.329
Fei-Hong! Fei-Hong!

53:25.167 --> 53:29.399
Please, don't! Please!

53:29.471 --> 53:32.338
You're killing him, Wong, can't you see?

53:32.407 --> 53:35.308
I don't care! I want him out!

53:36.378 --> 53:37.538
Father!

53:39.248 --> 53:41.341
Up! Get out of here!

53:41.416 --> 53:43.043
Aah!

53:47.089 --> 53:49.853
That was self-defence! He didn't mean to
do it!

53:49.925 --> 53:51.256
Tell your father you're sorry!

53:51.326 --> 53:53.226
Out!

53:53.295 --> 53:54.853
Now!

53:55.931 --> 53:58.161
Fei-Hong! Come back!

53:58.233 --> 54:00.463
After him, Cho! Don't let him go!

54:05.274 --> 54:06.366
Cho!

54:08.343 --> 54:10.277
That way.

54:11.513 --> 54:12.673
Oh, yes.

54:18.765 --> 54:20.357
How many you want?

54:20.433 --> 54:23.527
Excuse me, sir. Where can I find
the herbal shop?

54:23.603 --> 54:24.627
Right down on left.

54:24.704 --> 54:26.194
Thank you. Here you go.

54:26.272 --> 54:28.172
Hello. Beer, please.

54:28.241 --> 54:29.765
Yes, sir. Very good, sir.

54:32.345 --> 54:34.279
I've never seen you drink so much.

54:34.347 --> 54:35.336
You know your father's going to be

54:35.415 --> 54:37.975
very angry with you, Fei-Hong.

54:38.050 --> 54:40.644
Let's not talk about this.

54:40.720 --> 54:42.415
Bring me another drink.

54:42.488 --> 54:43.580
Keep it coming.

54:43.656 --> 54:45.749
Ah, no way. That's it for tonight.

54:45.825 --> 54:47.292
Ahh.

54:47.360 --> 54:50.352
Excuse me, miss?

54:50.430 --> 54:52.523
I want a song here.

54:52.598 --> 54:55.260
Something I should sing?

54:55.334 --> 54:58.895
The Ocean's Crying, but I sing it.

55:00.573 --> 55:02.803
You play for me now?

55:02.875 --> 55:04.433
OK.

55:08.080 --> 55:10.480
Mmm.

55:10.550 --> 55:12.677
I am so sent down

55:14.353 --> 55:17.049
I was so happy and now

55:17.123 --> 55:20.217
I'm all alone with no home

55:20.293 --> 55:23.091
What can I do?

55:23.162 --> 55:26.029
If not for the wine

55:26.098 --> 55:30.432
I'd be hurting all the time

55:30.503 --> 55:34.872
If only I could go home

55:34.941 --> 55:38.502
Father, listen to me now

55:38.578 --> 55:41.775
What can I do to make it up

55:41.848 --> 55:45.011
To make you proud

55:45.084 --> 55:48.281
Make you proud

55:48.354 --> 55:52.017
I only tried to help

55:52.091 --> 55:54.651
When I saw the bonsai tree

55:54.727 --> 55:57.924
I thought I was so smart

55:57.997 --> 55:59.191
Why did you...

55:59.265 --> 56:01.495
There he is, right over there.

56:01.567 --> 56:03.125
He doesn't look so bad.

56:03.202 --> 56:04.635
Oh, yes, he is.

56:04.704 --> 56:07.468
He's real tough. A fighter.

56:07.540 --> 56:10.202
Well, let's just see about this.

56:10.276 --> 56:12.210
I still love you

56:12.278 --> 56:14.872
No matter what you...

56:14.947 --> 56:17.211
Party's over. I suggest you go.

56:17.283 --> 56:19.410
No matter what you do

56:19.485 --> 56:21.146
What? You stop that!

56:21.220 --> 56:23.279
Love you

56:23.356 --> 56:24.823
You shut up! Listen to me!

56:24.891 --> 56:27.325
The rest of you, go on home!

56:27.393 --> 56:28.587
Go on! Get out of here!

56:28.661 --> 56:30.595
Yeah. You gotta leave.

56:30.663 --> 56:32.130
Go on. Move!

56:32.198 --> 56:34.598
Let's get out of the way.

56:34.667 --> 56:38.068
What happened to the music?

56:41.007 --> 56:42.474
Oh! - Aah!

56:46.245 --> 56:47.712
Are you the drunken boxer?

56:49.148 --> 56:52.276
Sure. I'm pretty drunk,

56:52.351 --> 56:54.717
but I don't know about boxing.

56:54.787 --> 56:56.755
He's just faking.

56:59.458 --> 57:01.426
Hyah!

57:05.164 --> 57:08.930
Come on. What's the matter with
you?

57:09.001 --> 57:10.593
Get up and fight me!

57:12.438 --> 57:14.963
That's Fei-Hong.

57:15.041 --> 57:16.736
Out of my way! What are you doing?

57:16.809 --> 57:17.741
Hey.

57:17.810 --> 57:19.209
It's none of your goddam business.

57:21.347 --> 57:22.314
Aah!

57:25.051 --> 57:26.313
Get him out!

57:26.385 --> 57:30.014
What's going on? Is this some kind of
joke?

57:30.089 --> 57:32.114
No! You should have seen him!

57:32.191 --> 57:34.250
He couldn't be stopped. Ask anyone.

57:34.327 --> 57:36.124
I'll stop him.

57:41.701 --> 57:43.498
We finished him!

57:45.838 --> 57:49.467
Ha ha! Why you kick me?

57:49.542 --> 57:53.535
Look at you. Get up and fight me! Come
on!

57:53.613 --> 57:56.446
Get this drunk out of my sight!

57:56.515 --> 57:58.278
Go! Go on! Kill him!

57:58.351 --> 58:00.512
No, wait. Not yet.

58:00.586 --> 58:03.885
Don't kill him, teach him a lesson.

58:03.956 --> 58:05.719
All right, you've had it now.

58:05.791 --> 58:07.053
Careful, he's tricky!

58:10.363 --> 58:11.625
Fei-Hong.

58:11.697 --> 58:12.959
He's hurt bad, yeah.

58:14.066 --> 58:15.033
Girl: Come.

58:15.101 --> 58:17.934
Ooh, that's bad. Let's go.

58:18.004 --> 58:19.266
Oh, God.

58:22.108 --> 58:23.439
Fei-Hong!

58:26.912 --> 58:27.879
Up there!

58:27.947 --> 58:28.879
Wang!

58:32.451 --> 58:35.887
Get him! Cut him down!

58:45.277 --> 58:48.212
Fei-Hong, don't be ashamed.

58:48.280 --> 58:52.683
When we were kids, we used to go naked
all the time.

58:52.751 --> 58:55.015
I should have found you sooner.

58:55.087 --> 58:58.386
You'll be OK. Just give it some time.

59:00.425 --> 59:01.858
By the way...

59:01.927 --> 59:04.157
I have some good news, too.

59:04.229 --> 59:07.790
Just listen to me. Guess what.

59:07.866 --> 59:10.699
Every woman in town wants to be your
wife.

59:10.769 --> 59:12.532
It's the truth.

59:12.604 --> 59:15.596
Hey, all right. Come on.

59:15.674 --> 59:17.505
Dry your eyes.

59:17.576 --> 59:19.510
Father...

59:19.578 --> 59:20.567
I know.

59:23.015 --> 59:25.848
I have a good reason to forbid drunken
boxing.

59:25.917 --> 59:29.182
Those who practice it frequently wind up
as alcoholics.

59:29.254 --> 59:31.620
Not if one uses restraint and self-
discipline.

59:31.690 --> 59:33.851
But that's more difficult than you might
think.

59:33.925 --> 59:37.952
It's true that alcohol can make
the body loose

59:38.030 --> 59:39.497
and its pain threshold higher,

59:39.564 --> 59:42.829
but it's difficult to drink the proper
amount.

59:42.901 --> 59:45.165
Many drunken boxers become nothing more

59:45.237 --> 59:47.205
than drunken fools.

59:47.272 --> 59:49.103
The odds of bringing shame and disgrace

59:49.174 --> 59:52.337
upon oneself and one's family is just
too great.

59:52.411 --> 59:55.039
It also reminds me there is an ancient
proverb

59:55.113 --> 59:57.946
that equates the drinking of alcohol
with water-

59:58.016 --> 01:00:01.349
"Boats can float on water, " or so it
says,

01:00:01.420 --> 01:00:03.320
"but they can sink in it, too. "

01:00:03.388 --> 01:00:04.946
Now, that's a profound lesson.

01:00:05.023 --> 01:00:06.456
I have only one question.

01:00:06.525 --> 01:00:07.457
What?

01:00:07.526 --> 01:00:09.050
Whose boat are we talking about?

01:00:27.579 --> 01:00:29.706
I will never drink again.

01:00:39.224 --> 01:00:41.954
Ah, there, there, Fei-Hong.

01:00:42.027 --> 01:00:43.858
I'm glad to see that you're OK now.

01:00:43.929 --> 01:00:45.863
Come on, let's get up and thank all your
friends here

01:00:45.931 --> 01:00:47.899
for helping you. Go on.

01:00:47.966 --> 01:00:49.900
Ho Sang: Fei-Hong, you OK?

01:00:49.968 --> 01:00:52.664
Thank you.

01:00:52.738 --> 01:00:55.036
You OK?

01:00:55.107 --> 01:00:56.540
You should...

01:00:56.608 --> 01:00:58.872
Don't ever give up. You'll be
better now.

01:00:58.944 --> 01:01:00.343
Everybody makes mistakes.

01:01:00.412 --> 01:01:01.845
How's the baby today?

01:01:01.913 --> 01:01:03.744
He's just fine. Let him be.

01:01:03.815 --> 01:01:06.340
Oh. All right.

01:01:22.734 --> 01:01:24.258
Sorry, we are closed now.

01:01:25.637 --> 01:01:27.571
Where's Fei-Hong?

01:01:27.639 --> 01:01:28.628
Excuse me?

01:01:28.707 --> 01:01:29.901
Is he here?

01:01:29.975 --> 01:01:31.772
He might be. What for?

01:01:31.843 --> 01:01:33.333
It's private.

01:01:34.646 --> 01:01:36.204
May I come in?

01:01:37.749 --> 01:01:39.740
Well, in that case...

01:01:41.887 --> 01:01:43.821
I know who sent you.

01:01:43.889 --> 01:01:47.052
What was that for? Keep your distance.

01:01:47.125 --> 01:01:49.320
That's enough. I want you to leave.

01:01:57.669 --> 01:01:58.931
Hmm.

01:02:00.372 --> 01:02:02.033
You know, you're not bad.

01:02:14.853 --> 01:02:16.184
Huh? It's you!

01:02:16.254 --> 01:02:17.186
You!

01:02:17.255 --> 01:02:19.223
Fei-Hong, hold him for me!

01:02:19.291 --> 01:02:21.282
Unh!

01:02:21.359 --> 01:02:22.724
Help.

01:02:26.932 --> 01:02:28.365
Father, help!

01:02:28.433 --> 01:02:30.196
Help him! - That's enough!

01:02:30.268 --> 01:02:32.236
Hurting me! Aah!

01:02:32.304 --> 01:02:34.169
Fei-Hong, are you all right?

01:02:34.239 --> 01:02:35.797
Yeah, I was just pretending.

01:02:35.874 --> 01:02:36.863
Fei-Hong, who is that?

01:02:42.948 --> 01:02:43.880
Hey!

01:02:43.949 --> 01:02:45.678
Fei-Hong, hold it!

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:47.650
We have you surrounded!

01:02:47.719 --> 01:02:49.152
I'm talking to you.

01:02:49.221 --> 01:02:50.984
Yeah. Would you stop?

01:02:51.056 --> 01:02:52.489
Me?

01:02:52.557 --> 01:02:53.785
Please, sir, I hope you can
forgive us.

01:02:53.859 --> 01:02:56.521
I am Wong Kei-Ying. I apologise.

01:02:56.595 --> 01:02:59.393
You are very famous. Meeting you is an
honour.

01:02:59.464 --> 01:03:01.762
I am Fu Wen-Chi.

01:03:01.833 --> 01:03:03.698
Fu Wen-Chi?

01:03:03.768 --> 01:03:05.463
Our most decorated Manchu officer.

01:03:05.537 --> 01:03:07.300
Is it true?

01:03:07.372 --> 01:03:08.964
Yes, it is.

01:03:09.040 --> 01:03:10.302
It's an honour. Welcome.

01:03:10.375 --> 01:03:12.275
Right this way. - Thank you.

01:03:12.344 --> 01:03:14.369
Good evening.

01:03:14.446 --> 01:03:16.778
I guess that man is someone important.

01:03:16.848 --> 01:03:18.782
Trust me, if he was important,

01:03:18.850 --> 01:03:21.250
he wouldn't be hitting women, would he?

01:03:21.319 --> 01:03:22.251
Oh.

01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.878
Think about it.

01:03:23.955 --> 01:03:24.887
What?

01:03:24.956 --> 01:03:26.685
Keep searching. We have to find it.

01:03:26.758 --> 01:03:27.918
Look in the parlour when you're done.

01:03:27.993 --> 01:03:28.925
Yes, ma'am.

01:03:28.994 --> 01:03:30.791
You have no idea where you left it?

01:03:30.862 --> 01:03:33.160
No, I don't.

01:03:33.231 --> 01:03:34.698
Where could it be?

01:03:34.766 --> 01:03:36.427
Cho might know.

01:03:38.303 --> 01:03:39.463
Hey!

01:03:39.538 --> 01:03:40.766
Something's wrong?

01:03:40.839 --> 01:03:44.570
Oh, it's hot tonight. I can't stand it.

01:03:44.643 --> 01:03:46.873
She's quite a handful.

01:03:46.945 --> 01:03:50.039
Oh, think I'll get some ice.

01:03:50.115 --> 01:03:52.174
Cho, where's the jade box I had?

01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:53.274
What?

01:03:53.351 --> 01:03:54.909
Where did you put it?

01:03:54.986 --> 01:03:56.476
I don't know.

01:03:56.555 --> 01:03:57.487
What is that?

01:03:57.556 --> 01:03:59.319
Ground garlic.

01:03:59.391 --> 01:04:01.382
I mean there in your hand.

01:04:03.828 --> 01:04:05.523
We found it!

01:04:05.597 --> 01:04:06.962
Fei-Hong, where are you going?

01:04:07.032 --> 01:04:08.829
Mom! - I'm not finished with that.

01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:10.993
Fu: When you surprised me in the baggage
car,

01:04:11.069 --> 01:04:12.730
I was trying to get back thejade seal

01:04:12.804 --> 01:04:15.170
that Ambassador Morley had stolen.

01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.299
I wound up with your ginseng instead.

01:04:17.375 --> 01:04:19.138
Tell me something,

01:04:19.210 --> 01:04:21.508
there must be a hundred jade seals in
our museum.

01:04:21.580 --> 01:04:22.740
Is this one so special?

01:04:22.814 --> 01:04:25.749
Fei-Hong, they all are special.

01:04:25.817 --> 01:04:27.512
Think about this.

01:04:27.586 --> 01:04:29.611
Today they plunder a seal.

01:04:29.688 --> 01:04:31.588
It seems small.

01:04:31.656 --> 01:04:34.181
Tomorrow they take another, and the next
thing you know,

01:04:34.259 --> 01:04:38.059
the Great Wall is gone. And what's next?

01:04:38.129 --> 01:04:42.589
Our children must travel abroad just to
see their history.

01:04:42.667 --> 01:04:45.830
So, don't you see that you and I

01:04:45.904 --> 01:04:48.873
are the only possible defence

01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:51.932
from governments trying to strip us of
our culture?

01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:53.307
So, I hope you can help me do this,

01:04:53.378 --> 01:04:57.337
if only for the future generations of
our people.

01:04:57.415 --> 01:05:00.976
All right. I'll be honoured to help.

01:05:01.052 --> 01:05:02.713
Thank you, Fei-Hong.

01:05:05.123 --> 01:05:08.024
It's awfully quiet all of a sudden.

01:05:08.093 --> 01:05:09.082
Where is everyone?

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.889
Yeah. There's no one here.

01:05:12.263 --> 01:05:13.628
I'll go take a look.

01:05:17.869 --> 01:05:19.200
What the...

01:05:19.270 --> 01:05:20.897
Yaah!

01:05:22.574 --> 01:05:26.101
Aah! - Aah!

01:05:26.177 --> 01:05:28.668
Let's go! Let's go! Move!

01:05:31.049 --> 01:05:32.346
Uh-oh.

01:05:32.417 --> 01:05:34.214
What do we do?

01:05:34.285 --> 01:05:35.582
Follow me.

01:05:41.292 --> 01:05:42.554
Here I go!

01:05:49.501 --> 01:05:50.695
Get him!

01:06:23.368 --> 01:06:24.630
Huh?

01:06:32.777 --> 01:06:34.210
All right, lift it!

01:06:41.152 --> 01:06:42.449
Fu: Here, Fei-Hong!

01:06:47.158 --> 01:06:48.313
Let's go!

01:07:02.994 --> 01:07:05.519
Aah! - Aah!

01:07:05.597 --> 01:07:07.758
Oh, they started.

01:07:07.833 --> 01:07:09.733
Oh, I see the fun's begun.

01:07:09.801 --> 01:07:11.428
Sounds great.

01:07:11.503 --> 01:07:14.336
When you have the Ax Gang, you're sure
to get the job done.

01:07:14.406 --> 01:07:16.101
That's what we're paying for.

01:07:22.114 --> 01:07:24.708
Fei-Hong, here!

01:07:24.783 --> 01:07:25.772
Hai!

01:08:08.326 --> 01:08:09.418
Unh!

01:08:13.665 --> 01:08:15.690
Huh? - Fu: Fei-Hong!

01:08:21.305 --> 01:08:22.966
Oh, my God! No!

01:08:25.277 --> 01:08:26.368
Aah!

01:08:34.685 --> 01:08:36.448
Hai! Yaah!

01:08:37.522 --> 01:08:42.015
Fei-Hong! Your shirt, take it off!

01:08:42.093 --> 01:08:43.582
OK!

01:09:30.375 --> 01:09:32.536
Quickly, now, go! - This way!

01:09:32.611 --> 01:09:34.841
Go! Go! Move it!

01:09:40.484 --> 01:09:41.645
Run! Go on!

01:09:48.894 --> 01:09:52.057
What's this? What's going on?

01:09:52.130 --> 01:09:53.256
Don't get involved.

01:09:54.966 --> 01:09:56.228
Get on out of here.

01:09:56.301 --> 01:09:57.598
Now. Go on.

01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:58.601
Help.

01:09:58.670 --> 01:10:00.103
That's Fu Wen-Chi!

01:10:00.171 --> 01:10:02.571
Unh!

01:10:08.747 --> 01:10:10.271
Ow! That hurt!

01:10:15.453 --> 01:10:16.852
Hey! -

01:10:19.424 --> 01:10:20.448
Fu Wen-Chi!

01:10:21.626 --> 01:10:22.650
There! - Master Fu!

01:10:22.727 --> 01:10:25.161
Huh? Come on! Let's go!

01:10:27.198 --> 01:10:28.130
Master Fu!

01:10:28.199 --> 01:10:31.498
Get behind! - Help! Help!

01:10:31.570 --> 01:10:35.563
Aah! - Easy, easy!

01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:37.107
Try to stop the bleeding.

01:10:37.175 --> 01:10:38.369
Don't die!

01:10:38.443 --> 01:10:39.933
Hold on! Master Fu!

01:10:40.011 --> 01:10:41.808
We'll go for a doctor! You'll be all
right!

01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:43.541
The royal seal...

01:10:43.615 --> 01:10:45.048
I know. We'll get it.

01:10:45.116 --> 01:10:46.242
Don't worry. I'll find it.

01:10:46.318 --> 01:10:49.253
The embassy. Go quickly.

01:10:49.321 --> 01:10:50.754
What do I do? - Tonight.

01:10:50.822 --> 01:10:53.757
Hold on, Master. My father will take
care of you.

01:10:53.825 --> 01:10:56.385
I promise. Don't give up!

01:10:57.963 --> 01:11:00.454
No, Master Fu! Come on!

01:11:03.868 --> 01:11:07.360
What are you thinking?

01:11:07.439 --> 01:11:09.304
Nothing!

01:11:37.769 --> 01:11:39.669
May I give you a light?

01:11:39.738 --> 01:11:43.572
Hold this, please. Thanks very much.

01:11:43.642 --> 01:11:45.667
There you are.

01:11:52.651 --> 01:11:54.585
Carry on.

01:12:05.497 --> 01:12:07.260
Pick it up. What's wrong with you?

01:12:27.619 --> 01:12:29.052
Chang Tsan? - Fei-Hong?

01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:31.645
Come on! You almost killed me!

01:12:31.723 --> 01:12:33.486
What are you doing here?

01:12:33.558 --> 01:12:34.650
Me? What are you doing here? Come on.

01:12:37.729 --> 01:12:38.753
I got him.

01:12:40.365 --> 01:12:41.764
So, where's the seal?

01:12:41.833 --> 01:12:43.130
How should I know? Let's go.

01:12:43.201 --> 01:12:45.135
Here.

01:12:45.203 --> 01:12:46.602
Thanks.

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:50.701
Anybody see you?

01:12:50.775 --> 01:12:53.608
No. I can't see. You got a light?

01:12:53.678 --> 01:12:56.146
Of course. Hold it.

01:13:01.886 --> 01:13:03.319
Down.

01:13:29.447 --> 01:13:31.540
Ambassador: Looking for something?

01:13:33.885 --> 01:13:35.978
Is this what brought you here?

01:13:36.054 --> 01:13:38.284
Kneel!

01:13:38.356 --> 01:13:40.017
Ambassador: I hope you don't mind.

01:13:40.091 --> 01:13:43.117
We've taken the liberty to document your
stay

01:13:43.194 --> 01:13:46.027
at our magnificent embassy.

01:13:46.097 --> 01:13:47.462
Please do enjoy our hospitality.

01:13:47.532 --> 01:13:49.898
You can go straight to hell!

01:14:04.916 --> 01:14:06.213
That's enough! Over!

01:14:06.284 --> 01:14:07.842
A winner.

01:14:07.919 --> 01:14:10.149
That'll be all, gentlemen.

01:14:10.221 --> 01:14:12.052
We'll continue the plan as scheduled.

01:14:12.123 --> 01:14:13.181
Yes, sir. - Yes, sir.

01:14:13.258 --> 01:14:14.782
Thank you.

01:14:19.931 --> 01:14:21.865
Things have worked out rather well

01:14:21.933 --> 01:14:23.764
now that we have the jade seal back

01:14:23.835 --> 01:14:26.633
and a way to acquire Po Chi Lam.

01:14:26.704 --> 01:14:28.797
That's right. I've already sent

01:14:28.873 --> 01:14:31.501
the embassy photographs of Fei-Hong and
his friend

01:14:31.576 --> 01:14:34.067
to Master Wong.

01:14:34.145 --> 01:14:36.477
He'll sell just like I told you.

01:14:36.548 --> 01:14:37.606
He has no choice.

01:14:37.682 --> 01:14:40.344
Make sure he understands, John,

01:14:40.418 --> 01:14:43.012
that we expect him to vacate the Po Chi
Lam immediately,

01:14:43.087 --> 01:14:45.740
or we'll plan to execute Fei-Hong.

01:14:45.874 --> 01:14:47.068
Oh!

01:14:47.142 --> 01:14:48.734
Damn those boys!

01:14:48.810 --> 01:14:51.040
Don't they understand there's nothing we
can do?

01:14:51.112 --> 01:14:53.740
As an embassy, they're exempt from the
laws of China.

01:14:53.815 --> 01:14:55.680
Maybe we can reason with them. I'll go.

01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:58.184
Sit down! You know what they want-

01:14:58.253 --> 01:15:00.551
the rights to Po Chi Lam!

01:15:00.622 --> 01:15:02.487
They just wanted to return the seal.

01:15:02.557 --> 01:15:03.888
They aren't the criminals.

01:15:03.958 --> 01:15:05.448
You spoiled him! - You disowned him!

01:15:05.527 --> 01:15:07.461
- This is all your fault! - This is all
your fault!

01:15:07.529 --> 01:15:09.258
You're impossible.

01:15:09.330 --> 01:15:11.230
And you're his father.

01:15:11.299 --> 01:15:13.961
We're running out of time. We've got to
do something.

01:15:14.035 --> 01:15:14.967
You're right.

01:15:15.036 --> 01:15:17.129
I refuse.

01:15:17.205 --> 01:15:18.638
How can I?

01:15:18.706 --> 01:15:21.698
You know this land has been in our
family for centuries.

01:15:21.776 --> 01:15:24.142
There has always been a school here.

01:15:24.212 --> 01:15:26.908
What would you do, just give it up?

01:15:26.981 --> 01:15:29.415
I'll never do it.

01:15:29.484 --> 01:15:31.418
Oh, really? What would his mother have
done?

01:15:31.486 --> 01:15:32.817
I bet I know!

01:15:36.558 --> 01:15:40.688
Sister, I need your wisdom

01:15:40.762 --> 01:15:43.162
more than ever.

01:15:43.231 --> 01:15:45.529
What can we do for Fei-Hong?

01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:48.034
Can you help us?

01:15:58.446 --> 01:15:59.378
Release them.

01:15:59.447 --> 01:16:01.381
You may let them go.

01:16:11.659 --> 01:16:13.559
You OK?

01:16:13.628 --> 01:16:16.358
Just go on.

01:16:16.431 --> 01:16:18.126
Tsan.

01:16:18.199 --> 01:16:19.131
I'm grateful.

01:16:19.200 --> 01:16:22.135
Are you hurt? OK.

01:16:23.238 --> 01:16:24.899
Just look at you.

01:16:24.973 --> 01:16:27.965
I'm gonna be all right.

01:16:28.042 --> 01:16:29.509
Madam Wong.

01:16:29.577 --> 01:16:31.169
Are you OK, Master?

01:16:31.246 --> 01:16:33.043
Some bruises, but I'll be fine.

01:16:33.114 --> 01:16:34.638
So, what will we do now?

01:16:34.716 --> 01:16:35.910
What do you mean?

01:16:35.984 --> 01:16:38.248
Master Wong has sold the school to the
embassy.

01:16:38.319 --> 01:16:40.184
He did what?!

01:16:40.255 --> 01:16:41.244
How could that be?

01:16:41.322 --> 01:16:43.517
Don't you see? They made him sell it.

01:16:43.591 --> 01:16:45.525
He had to or they would kill you both.

01:16:45.593 --> 01:16:47.959
You're just lucky to be alive.

01:16:48.029 --> 01:16:51.692
Fei-Hong, this fight is over.

01:16:51.766 --> 01:16:53.825
We can't do this anymore.

01:16:53.902 --> 01:16:55.563
I hope you know your father has
sacrificed everything.

01:16:55.637 --> 01:16:59.403
I wish that they had killed me.

01:16:59.474 --> 01:17:02.534
Now, Fei-Hong, that is enough.

01:17:02.610 --> 01:17:05.636
Life's changes are like a moving river.

01:17:05.713 --> 01:17:08.443
What's here today is gone tomorrow

01:17:08.516 --> 01:17:10.780
and tomorrow brings a whole new journey.

01:17:10.852 --> 01:17:12.979
Let's move forward and live.

01:17:17.992 --> 01:17:21.894
So, when will the ship be leaving?

01:17:21.963 --> 01:17:23.089
This Tuesday.

01:17:23.164 --> 01:17:25.428
Hmm. And everything's ready?

01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:27.525
Yes, sir. Ready and waiting, sir.

01:17:27.602 --> 01:17:28.796
Good, good.

01:17:28.870 --> 01:17:31.395
I want to close down the factory, lay
off the workers,

01:17:31.472 --> 01:17:33.406
and transport the shipment to Hong Kong.

01:17:33.474 --> 01:17:34.907
Pick it up.

01:17:34.976 --> 01:17:36.739
Yes, sir.

01:17:41.683 --> 01:17:43.981
First we work overtime!

01:17:44.052 --> 01:17:46.213
We refuse, then they beat us!

01:17:46.287 --> 01:17:48.187
Chin: And now they think they can fire
all of us

01:17:48.256 --> 01:17:49.450
just like that!

01:17:49.524 --> 01:17:52.755
So, are you guys going to let him get
away with that?

01:17:52.827 --> 01:17:54.590
What do you say, huh?

01:17:54.662 --> 01:17:57.028
Chang Tsan, what's going on?

01:17:57.098 --> 01:17:59.259
They closed the mill, and you know what?

01:17:59.334 --> 01:18:00.767
It was English ambassador

01:18:00.835 --> 01:18:03.702
who was in charge of doing it.

01:18:03.771 --> 01:18:06.035
Sounds like trouble. I don't think I can
help you.

01:18:06.107 --> 01:18:08.837
Oh, sure. You didn't lose your job.

01:18:08.910 --> 01:18:11.003
Well, I'm not gonna let them push us
around.

01:18:11.079 --> 01:18:12.546
Yeah. As soon as they finished the last
shipment,

01:18:12.613 --> 01:18:14.103
they fired all the men.

01:18:14.182 --> 01:18:17.151
And you think they have something to do
with it?

01:18:17.218 --> 01:18:19.686
I don't know, but I'm going to find out
for sure.

01:18:19.754 --> 01:18:21.585
Let me think what it could be.

01:18:21.656 --> 01:18:23.419
We should check the office.

01:18:23.491 --> 01:18:26.858
Fei-Hong, could that be it?

01:18:26.928 --> 01:18:28.793
Well, we know they're up to something.

01:18:28.863 --> 01:18:31.127
Find a way into the factory. - OK.

01:18:31.199 --> 01:18:32.723
Then we'll find a way to stop them.

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:34.597
Let's go.

01:18:47.382 --> 01:18:49.145
Chin: What... What's this?

01:18:49.217 --> 01:18:52.448
My God! Look what they're doing!

01:18:52.520 --> 01:18:54.920
Well, we've got to stop them.

01:18:54.989 --> 01:18:56.081
I'll tell Fei-Hong.

01:18:56.157 --> 01:18:57.089
Hurry, Ho Sang!

01:18:58.159 --> 01:19:00.024
In a hurry?

01:19:00.094 --> 01:19:01.186
Sorry.

01:19:02.997 --> 01:19:04.157
Aah!

01:19:04.232 --> 01:19:05.893
Let go!

01:19:05.967 --> 01:19:08.435
Aah!

01:19:16.811 --> 01:19:18.904
Unh!

01:19:28.656 --> 01:19:30.624
Chin: Go get help!

01:19:36.531 --> 01:19:38.226
Ho Sang, this way!

01:19:38.299 --> 01:19:40.062
No. I've got to tell Fei-Hong.

01:19:41.903 --> 01:19:44.133
Get out of here!

01:19:44.205 --> 01:19:45.194
Get them!

01:19:49.143 --> 01:19:50.303
Bring Fei-Hong!

01:19:51.512 --> 01:19:52.444
Go now!

01:19:52.513 --> 01:19:53.946
Yaah!

01:20:02.023 --> 01:20:03.547
Yaah!

01:20:08.396 --> 01:20:10.227
Shit!

01:20:11.933 --> 01:20:14.800
Madam, they're coming out.

01:20:14.869 --> 01:20:17.463
All right, keep it down.

01:20:17.538 --> 01:20:18.971
Then we can organise.

01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:20.974
A good idea. Good day.

01:20:21.042 --> 01:20:22.236
Goodbye. Have a safe trip.

01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:23.777
Take care of the baby.

01:20:23.845 --> 01:20:25.938
I will.

01:20:26.013 --> 01:20:28.538
Fei-Hong?

01:20:28.616 --> 01:20:29.583
Yes, Father?

01:20:29.650 --> 01:20:31.208
Don't get up. Keep working.

01:20:31.285 --> 01:20:32.547
Are you almost through with that?

01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:34.451
Almost finished.

01:20:34.522 --> 01:20:36.490
Then start another one.

01:20:36.557 --> 01:20:39.082
I'll make sure he does. It's my
responsibility.

01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:40.923
He's not allowed to leave. You
understand me?

01:20:40.995 --> 01:20:42.360
Perfectly.

01:20:42.430 --> 01:20:43.761
All right. Good.

01:20:45.299 --> 01:20:46.459
You know, dear,

01:20:46.534 --> 01:20:48.661
I've been thinking about names for the
baby.

01:20:48.736 --> 01:20:51.796
If we were to have a boy, he could be
Wong Tei-Pau.

01:20:51.873 --> 01:20:53.841
If it's a girl, Wong Pei.

01:20:53.908 --> 01:20:55.432
Nice. Both names are fine.

01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:57.637
But do we really need to pick one now?

01:20:57.712 --> 01:20:58.644
What if I'm early?

01:20:58.713 --> 01:21:00.044
That shouldn't be a problem

01:21:00.114 --> 01:21:01.706
if you take it easy till I get back.

01:21:01.782 --> 01:21:02.646
Of course.

01:21:02.717 --> 01:21:04.685
Fei-Hong? - Yes?

01:21:04.752 --> 01:21:05.719
Water the plants.

01:21:05.786 --> 01:21:07.219
I will!

01:21:07.288 --> 01:21:09.518
Hold on! I've got to go.

01:21:09.590 --> 01:21:11.387
Remember, get lots of rest.

01:21:11.459 --> 01:21:13.222
We'll be fine. Don't worry.

01:21:13.294 --> 01:21:14.318
Fei-Hong and I will be just fine.

01:21:14.395 --> 01:21:16.761
Go! We don't have any time to spare!

01:21:16.831 --> 01:21:18.594
Hurry!

01:21:21.202 --> 01:21:23.693
We've got to get Chin out of there.

01:21:23.771 --> 01:21:25.432
I hope he's still alive.

01:21:25.506 --> 01:21:26.939
What can we do?

01:21:27.008 --> 01:21:28.942
I'm going to stop them. I'm going to do
what I can!

01:21:29.010 --> 01:21:31.672
I gave my promise to Fu and Chin!

01:21:31.746 --> 01:21:34.044
What do you think?

01:21:34.115 --> 01:21:35.047
Let's go.

01:21:35.116 --> 01:21:37.846
Hey, wait, where are you going?

01:21:37.919 --> 01:21:38.908
I'm going to battle!

01:21:38.986 --> 01:21:40.010
But...

01:21:40.087 --> 01:21:41.884
Wait, madam, you can't go in your
condition.

01:21:41.956 --> 01:21:45.517
What condition? Come on, I'm only
pregnant.

01:21:45.593 --> 01:21:49.029
Oh, madam, please. Think about the baby.

01:21:49.096 --> 01:21:51.860
What if something were to happen?

01:21:51.933 --> 01:21:53.764
You're right. Go ahead without me, then.

01:21:53.834 --> 01:21:56.428
I'll go get my students. Meet me at the
mill.

01:21:56.504 --> 01:21:58.335
Right. I'll gather up the men.

01:21:58.406 --> 01:22:00.499
Oh, thanks, Fei-Hong.

01:22:00.575 --> 01:22:04.033
You're with us, right? Yeah, OK.

01:22:04.111 --> 01:22:05.669
Will you be all right, madam?

01:22:05.746 --> 01:22:07.373
I'll be fine. - Good.

01:22:07.448 --> 01:22:08.915
But what if Father finds out?

01:22:08.983 --> 01:22:11.315
Oh, go on. Who cares now what your
father thinks?

01:22:11.385 --> 01:22:12.750
Only make me proud.

01:22:12.820 --> 01:22:14.754
I will. OK.

01:22:14.822 --> 01:22:17.086
Oh! Fei-Hong! - Yeah?

01:22:17.158 --> 01:22:19.558
Something for good luck.

01:22:22.096 --> 01:22:23.586
I can use it.

01:22:25.967 --> 01:22:29.403
We demand justice! We demand
justice!

01:22:29.470 --> 01:22:33.429
We demand justice! We demand justice!

01:22:34.942 --> 01:22:37.172
Guards: Get back! Get back!

01:23:02.619 --> 01:23:04.109
You step aside now!

01:23:04.187 --> 01:23:06.451
We demand justice! We know what you have
in there!

01:23:06.523 --> 01:23:07.990
Back off!

01:23:08.058 --> 01:23:09.116
Those antiques are not yours,

01:23:09.192 --> 01:23:10.124
and we won't let them out of China!

01:23:10.193 --> 01:23:11.683
You have no right to them.

01:23:11.762 --> 01:23:13.889
Is that right?

01:23:19.836 --> 01:23:21.167
Charge!

01:23:28.278 --> 01:23:30.212
No! No guns!

01:23:30.280 --> 01:23:32.407
Kill them all!

01:23:53.003 --> 01:23:57.702
Fei-Hong, you've got to rescue jade now.

01:24:05.182 --> 01:24:07.673
Get back! - Stand back!

01:24:30.941 --> 01:24:33.569
Unh! Come on!

01:24:33.643 --> 01:24:35.702
Yaah! - Wait!

01:24:45.822 --> 01:24:47.312
Come on!

01:24:58.468 --> 01:24:59.730
One hand!

01:26:24.254 --> 01:26:26.779
Here's water!

01:26:26.856 --> 01:26:28.255
Thanks.

01:26:32.395 --> 01:26:33.953
No! - Yaah!

01:26:35.065 --> 01:26:37.260
Wait!

01:26:37.334 --> 01:26:38.266
You gotta find jade.

01:26:38.335 --> 01:26:39.597
Let's go!

01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:42.365
Yeah. Let's go.

01:26:42.439 --> 01:26:46.000
Boss! Boss! Boss!

01:26:46.076 --> 01:26:47.976
Boss!

01:26:48.044 --> 01:26:49.875
Boss! Boss!

01:26:49.946 --> 01:26:51.379
What happened?

01:26:51.448 --> 01:26:54.246
That drunken guy is here! We got to do
something!

01:26:54.317 --> 01:26:56.148
All right, get him!

01:27:08.098 --> 01:27:09.190
Won't this be fun.

01:27:14.304 --> 01:27:16.067
Wait!

01:27:16.139 --> 01:27:18.369
Do you realise what you're doing?

01:27:18.441 --> 01:27:21.035
You're helping them steal our history,
our culture.

01:27:22.412 --> 01:27:24.471
You mean these?

01:27:24.547 --> 01:27:26.071
They're of no use to anyone.

01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:28.208
If they want to buy them, I'll gladly
sell.

01:27:28.284 --> 01:27:29.308
I won't let you do it.

01:27:29.386 --> 01:27:32.378
And what are you gonna do about it?

01:27:32.455 --> 01:27:35.618
Listen here, nothing's gonna stand in my
way,

01:27:35.692 --> 01:27:37.887
so why don't you just go home to Daddy?

01:27:37.961 --> 01:27:39.451
I've heard enough.

01:27:39.529 --> 01:27:41.827
Oh? Well, that makes two of us.

01:27:41.898 --> 01:27:42.865
Henry?

01:27:42.932 --> 01:27:46.231
Don't waste time. Just get it over with.

01:27:46.302 --> 01:27:47.200
Do it.

01:27:48.672 --> 01:27:49.764
You hear me?

01:28:21.204 --> 01:28:22.364
Unh!

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.372
Sorry.

01:28:58.475 --> 01:29:00.375
Ha ha ha! Do something.

01:29:28.138 --> 01:29:31.130
Catch! Ha ha ha!

01:29:36.713 --> 01:29:40.342
What are you gonna do now? Ha ha
ha!

01:29:46.856 --> 01:29:47.982
Help him!

01:29:55.431 --> 01:29:56.363
Hey!

01:31:29.914 --> 01:31:32.348
Drunken boxing, huh?

01:31:33.451 --> 01:31:34.816
Well, what do you say?

01:31:38.056 --> 01:31:38.988
Come on!

01:32:01.579 --> 01:32:02.409
Ooh!

01:32:02.480 --> 01:32:04.539
You OK?

01:32:39.684 --> 01:32:43.142
Aah!

01:32:52.697 --> 01:32:54.688
Yaah!

01:33:03.007 --> 01:33:05.669
Now it's over!

01:33:18.523 --> 01:33:20.047
Give me another rod!

01:33:20.124 --> 01:33:21.648
What's this?

01:33:21.726 --> 01:33:24.490
"A boat can float in water, but also
sink in it"?

01:33:24.562 --> 01:33:26.996
Ahh, a bit of Daddy's wisdom.

01:33:30.268 --> 01:33:32.759
Here, finish him off!

01:33:34.572 --> 01:33:35.596
All right, this is it!

01:33:38.176 --> 01:33:40.076
Aah!

01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:54.324
Gah!

01:34:12.877 --> 01:34:14.174
Yaah!

01:35:23.448 --> 01:35:25.245
Just perfect!

01:35:27.385 --> 01:35:28.579
How about it?

01:36:52.336 --> 01:36:55.169
Raah!

01:38:18.656 --> 01:38:19.953
Hee hee hee!

01:38:27.431 --> 01:38:30.161
Yaah!

01:38:48.252 --> 01:38:50.220
Hmm.

01:38:58.563 --> 01:39:00.724
On behalf of the governor, I want to
thank Fei-Hong

01:39:00.798 --> 01:39:02.698
for his role in returning the stolen
antiquities

01:39:02.767 --> 01:39:04.826
and on the arrest of the ambassador.

01:39:04.902 --> 01:39:05.834
Thank you, sir.

01:39:05.903 --> 01:39:06.892
None of this could have happened

01:39:06.971 --> 01:39:08.370
without the support of his loving father.

01:39:08.439 --> 01:39:10.873
Ah, well, we need more fathers

01:39:10.942 --> 01:39:12.910
who treat their sons like that.

01:39:12.977 --> 01:39:16.344
You should be very proud of him.

01:39:16.414 --> 01:39:17.574
So, where is he?

01:39:17.648 --> 01:39:20.776
Fei-Hong is still feeling some of the
after-effects

01:39:20.852 --> 01:39:22.513
of all that he's been through.

01:39:22.587 --> 01:39:23.986
We hope he'll soon be on his feet.

01:39:24.055 --> 01:39:28.048
I'm sure that he will come see you as
soon as he can.

01:39:28.125 --> 01:39:30.093
Oh, and he better. I've got a job for
that boy.

01:39:30.161 --> 01:39:32.493
I am certain he will be most pleased.

01:39:32.563 --> 01:39:35.657
Smile! Count to 3! 1... 2...
