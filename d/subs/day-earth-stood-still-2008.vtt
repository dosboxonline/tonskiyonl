05:28.780 --> 05:30.700
<i>Thiobacillus,</i>

05:30.780 --> 05:33.410
which-- William--

05:33.490 --> 05:36.000
<i>is a remarkable bacterium because--</i>

05:36.080 --> 05:38.710
It's the only known organism
that lives in sulfuric acid.

05:38.790 --> 05:40.380
That's right. And--

05:40.500 --> 05:43.750
- Yes, Miss Rouhani?
- <i>Deinococcus radiodurans.</i>

05:43.840 --> 05:46.170
Um, first discovered in 1956...

05:46.260 --> 05:48.760
- breeding inside of drums of radioactive waste.
- <i>That's correct.</i>

05:48.840 --> 05:51.390
So, <i>pompejana, Thiobacillus, Deinococcus--</i>

05:51.470 --> 05:53.970
Which of these three
would most likely survive...

05:54.060 --> 05:58.060
in the extreme environment of the
Jupiter moon Callisto, and why?

05:58.140 --> 06:00.060
Tom, can you get the lights, please?

06:00.150 --> 06:02.230
<i>That's your lab report question
for this week,</i>

06:02.320 --> 06:04.440
and it's due in my box
by midnight on Friday.

06:04.530 --> 06:06.690
That's all for today. Thank you.

06:10.110 --> 06:12.780
So, are you coming to the faculty conference tonight?

06:12.870 --> 06:16.870
And listen to Dean Stoff lecture
about how the universe is like a beautiful woman?

06:16.950 --> 06:19.210
Think I'll pass.

06:19.290 --> 06:21.710
Come on. It'll be fun.

06:21.830 --> 06:24.290
I could pick you up.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.130
Um, I can't.

06:29.220 --> 06:33.430
I have to get back to my own extreme environment.
But thank you.

06:33.550 --> 06:35.970
- See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

06:45.320 --> 06:48.740
- <i>Come on. Go.</i>
- <i>Jacob?</i>

06:48.860 --> 06:51.700
Go, go!

06:51.780 --> 06:54.450
<i>Come on, come on!</i>

06:54.530 --> 06:56.870
- Yes!
- Jacob, dinner.

07:03.780 --> 07:04.960
Have you finished your homework?

07:05.090 --> 07:08.170
- Yes. You just killed me.
- Good. Now that you're dead,

07:08.260 --> 07:10.630
you can shut that off
and come down for dinner.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.430
- Did you order pepperoni tonight?
- Nope. Are these clean?

07:13.550 --> 07:15.680
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- We've had pizza twice this week,

07:15.760 --> 07:17.640
so I made you a proper meal tonight...

07:17.770 --> 07:20.600
- with vegetables.
- <i>Vegetables?</i>

07:21.690 --> 07:23.230
Stop being such a stepmom.

07:25.900 --> 07:27.900
Where'd you get this?

07:29.490 --> 07:31.070
It was Dad's.

07:31.150 --> 07:33.860
Yeah, I know. Where was it?

07:33.950 --> 07:38.740
I found it in the downstairs bathroom.
It's mine now.

07:40.750 --> 07:41.960
Okay.

07:42.080 --> 07:43.790
Okay.

07:43.920 --> 07:46.790
- Come on. I said please shut that off.
- <i>You didn't say "please."</i>

07:46.880 --> 07:48.670
- Jacob.
- Helen.

07:56.550 --> 07:58.470
- Hello?
- <i>Helen Benson?</i>

07:58.560 --> 08:00.810
- Yes.
- <i>Dr. Helen Benson?</i>

08:00.890 --> 08:02.890
<i>You're at 106 Longwood Road?</i>

08:02.980 --> 08:06.150
- Who is this?
- <i>Someone should be there shortly.</i>

08:06.230 --> 08:09.480
What do you mean, someone's coming here?
Who is this?

08:09.570 --> 08:12.240
<i>Everything will be explained to you en route.</i>

08:13.320 --> 08:15.320
En route where?

08:16.700 --> 08:19.120
- Hello?
- <i>They should be there soon.</i>

08:19.240 --> 08:21.200
<i>Yes. They're at your door now.</i>

08:23.580 --> 08:25.580
Hold on a minute.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.380
Dr. Benson, if you'll come with us.

08:32.510 --> 08:35.299
- What's happening?
- Everything will be explained.

08:35.380 --> 08:37.299
But you must come with us right away.

08:37.390 --> 08:39.260
Am I under arrest?

08:39.390 --> 08:41.600
- You're in federal custody.
- Why?

08:41.679 --> 08:43.679
What is this about?

08:43.770 --> 08:46.060
Everything will be explained en route.

08:46.190 --> 08:48.730
- I have a child here.
- Is there anyone who can look after the boy?

08:48.860 --> 08:51.110
- No.
- Can his father take care of him?

08:51.230 --> 08:53.740
- No, his father isn't here.
- I can take care of myself.

08:53.820 --> 08:56.700
Jacob, you can't take care of yourself.
There's just no way--

08:56.820 --> 08:59.320
- You're coming with us, Dr. Benson.
- Helen?

09:04.910 --> 09:07.420
Jacob, grab your coat.
You're gonna stay at Isabel's.

09:10.290 --> 09:12.170
<i>Attention, Bravo.
Prepare to move out. Over.</i>

09:13.700 --> 09:15.340
It's gonna be okay.

09:15.420 --> 09:17.470
Dr. Benson, there isn't much time.

09:21.010 --> 09:24.430
Okay, we've got her. Let's go.

09:43.580 --> 09:46.250
Two stoplights down, then left,
there's an on-ramp for the highway.

09:46.370 --> 09:47.910
- Do you see it?
- This must be a mistake.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.210
Helen Benson.
Social security number: 51-48-7843?

09:51.340 --> 09:52.920
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- It's no mistake.

09:53.000 --> 09:54.920
- What is this about?
- Everything will be explained.

09:55.050 --> 09:58.260
- Stop the car. Can you stop the car, please?
- Ma'am--

09:58.340 --> 10:00.430
<i>I am not under arrest. You can't do this.</i>

10:00.550 --> 10:03.260
- This is a matter of national security. You're just gonna--
- National security?

10:03.350 --> 10:05.270
That just means whatever you want it to mean.

10:05.350 --> 10:07.560
I'm just asking you to tell me
why I'm needed,

10:07.690 --> 10:10.440
- or to let me go.
- I can't tell you why you're needed, because I don't know.

10:10.560 --> 10:13.320
- But I know they need you, and I know it's urgent.
- How do you know that?

10:19.110 --> 10:21.110
Where are all the cars?

10:21.240 --> 10:23.910
- They shut down the highway.
- They shut it down?

10:24.040 --> 10:26.540
- For what?
- For us.

11:06.080 --> 11:08.370
I was driving up my driveway--

11:08.450 --> 11:10.790
<i>I was on the computer--</i>

11:12.460 --> 11:15.880
- Hi. I'm Yusef.
- Helen.

11:15.960 --> 11:19.130
Helen, do you have any idea
why this is happening to us?

11:19.260 --> 11:21.170
- No.
- <i>Well, think.</i>

11:21.260 --> 11:24.010
- What do we have in common?
- What do you do for a living, Yusef?

11:24.100 --> 11:25.710
- I'm a nuclear physicist.
- I'm an astronomer.

11:25.740 --> 11:27.810
- Geologist.
- I'm an astrobiologist.

11:27.840 --> 11:28.820
Fossil record study?

11:28.890 --> 11:31.730
No. Microbiology.
Theories of life beyond Earth.

11:31.850 --> 11:34.230
- All right, so we're all scientists.
- No, not me.

11:34.310 --> 11:37.150
- I'm a civil engineer.
- <i>Put it all together, and what do you get?</i>

11:37.230 --> 11:39.530
I've participated in government mobilizations
like this before.

11:39.610 --> 11:41.700
War games in preparations for certain scenarios.

11:41.820 --> 11:44.110
- Is that what you think this is?
- No.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.990
Whatever it is, it's not a game.

11:59.300 --> 12:03.130
<i>No! Keep those vehicles moving! Let's go!</i>

12:23.150 --> 12:25.070
<i>Your attention, please!</i>

12:25.160 --> 12:28.450
<i>Make your way directly across the courtyard
to the main barracks.</i>

12:28.530 --> 12:31.370
<i>Leave all your cell phones
and cameras here.</i>

12:31.450 --> 12:35.500
I repeat: cell phones and cameras
are not allowed inside.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.670
Leave any cell phones and cameras here.

12:37.750 --> 12:40.170
<i>Helen!
Will you bring her up?</i>

12:40.250 --> 12:43.210
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, you need to give up
your cell phones and your cameras.</i>

12:43.340 --> 12:45.260
- <i>Your attention, please!</i>
- Thank you.

12:45.340 --> 12:47.890
<i>Make your way directly across the courtyard
to the main barracks.</i>

12:48.010 --> 12:49.390
- <i>Helen.</i>
- Hi, Michael.

12:49.510 --> 12:51.430
- Been a long time.
- Are you behind all this?

12:51.520 --> 12:53.980
- Yes. I'm glad you came.
- It's not like I had a choice.

12:54.060 --> 12:57.230
Sorry about that.
I had you put on the vital list.

12:57.350 --> 13:00.110
- I thought it was important to have you a part of this team.
- Why?

13:00.190 --> 13:02.820
I've been keeping up with the work
that you've been doing with Professor Barnhardt.

13:02.900 --> 13:04.820
What does it have to do with this?

13:04.900 --> 13:06.860
I'll have to crash-brief you
in the conference room.

13:11.540 --> 13:14.370
Object 07-493...

13:14.460 --> 13:18.710
<i>was first spotted just beyond Jupiter's orbit
by the Spaceguard Program.</i>

13:18.790 --> 13:23.090
<i>It was notable for the fact
that it was not moving in an asteroidal ellipse,</i>

13:23.170 --> 13:26.130
but rather, it had a hyperbolic orbit...

13:26.220 --> 13:29.640
and was shooting through our solar system.

13:29.720 --> 13:35.560
The object is moving at speeds of up to
three times 10 to the seventh meters per second.

13:35.640 --> 13:40.810
<i>At first, it was projected to pass
millions of miles outside of Earth's orbit.</i>

13:40.900 --> 13:42.820
However, we soon discovered that...

13:42.900 --> 13:46.400
the object was not following
a gravitationally free fall trajectory.

13:46.490 --> 13:49.200
As such,

13:49.280 --> 13:52.450
its path was recalculated.

13:56.750 --> 14:00.170
It was at this time a crisis response team
was activated...

14:00.250 --> 14:02.590
and everything you see around you
was set in motion.

14:07.220 --> 14:09.260
Can we launch a missile to intercept it?

14:09.340 --> 14:12.430
<i>The military's attempting to do just that.
In fact, they may launch several.</i>

14:12.510 --> 14:15.850
But given the speed at which
this object is moving,

14:15.930 --> 14:19.560
our chances of success are slim at best.

14:19.690 --> 14:23.310
- Why don't they evacuate the area?
- <i>We simply do not have enough time.</i>

14:23.400 --> 14:26.730
The affected area contains
some eight million inhabitants.

14:26.820 --> 14:30.110
The best we can do is to plan for the aftermath.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.950
How long do we have?

14:36.500 --> 14:38.000
Seventy-eight minutes.

14:41.540 --> 14:44.540
<i>Hey, what did the cops want anyway?</i>

14:44.630 --> 14:47.760
Well, there's gonna be...

14:47.840 --> 14:50.970
a big storm tonight.

14:51.050 --> 14:52.970
And...

14:53.050 --> 14:55.180
they needed some scientists to help out.

14:55.260 --> 14:57.390
You know with...

14:57.470 --> 14:59.430
planning stuff.

14:59.520 --> 15:01.480
So, um,

15:03.310 --> 15:06.320
pretty soon, you're all gonna go down
to the basement, okay?

15:06.440 --> 15:09.740
- I already told Isabel.
- <i>I haven't seen anything on TV about--</i>

15:09.820 --> 15:12.160
Jacob, just--

15:12.240 --> 15:15.240
just do it, all right?

15:15.330 --> 15:17.330
<i>All right. I should go.</i>

15:17.410 --> 15:19.330
Wait. Um, can we talk...

15:19.410 --> 15:22.210
just a little bit longer?

15:22.290 --> 15:25.250
<i>We're having dinner now.
I really should go.</i>

15:26.590 --> 15:29.170
You know, I love you very much.

15:29.260 --> 15:31.590
<i>Okay. Bye, Helen.</i>

15:39.640 --> 15:41.640
Is that a cell phone?

15:44.940 --> 15:46.860
Can I borrow it?

15:55.700 --> 15:58.740
What are the odds of an asteroid
making impact on Manhattan?

15:58.830 --> 16:02.160
- Astronomical. Plus, there's no light signature.
- Then it can't be an asteroid.

16:02.290 --> 16:05.040
- A primordial black hole, perhaps.
- You know what that would mean?

16:05.130 --> 16:07.130
Whatever it is, if this object is moving...

16:07.210 --> 16:10.760
at three times 10 to the seventh meters per second,
there will be no aftermath.

16:10.840 --> 16:16.470
If they can't stop it before it hits,
there will be nothing left but dust.

16:16.550 --> 16:20.140
It will sterilize the Earth.
This is all theater.

16:20.220 --> 16:22.350
They're sayin' we lost launch capabilities.

16:22.430 --> 16:24.730
<i>What does that even mean?</i>

16:24.810 --> 16:27.480
- The missile's disabled.
- Disabled by what?

16:27.610 --> 16:29.610
- They don't know.
- <i>But they can restore it, right?</i>

16:29.690 --> 16:31.940
There's a fallback! They have to launch!

16:40.120 --> 16:41.910
Object impact in seven.

16:42.040 --> 16:43.910
- <i>Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.</i>
- Six. Five.

16:44.040 --> 16:45.460
- Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
- <i>Four.</i>

16:45.540 --> 16:47.960
- <i>on Earth as it is in heaven.</i>
- <i>Three. Two.</i>

16:48.090 --> 16:50.590
<i>One.</i>

16:56.340 --> 16:58.430
Where is it?

16:58.550 --> 17:00.350
- Could they have made a mistake?
- <i>Wait!</i>

17:00.430 --> 17:04.180
Roger that.
They're saying the object's still on its approach.

17:04.270 --> 17:06.349
Well, then where is it?

17:06.480 --> 17:09.609
- <i>It's slowing down.</i>
- I see it.

19:18.490 --> 19:22.860
Radiation levels are slightly elevated,
but it's not dangerous.

19:22.990 --> 19:26.030
I'm getting a lot of electrostatic interference.

19:26.120 --> 19:27.950
Yeah, me too.

19:30.040 --> 19:32.170
Did you feel that?

19:33.330 --> 19:34.920
Feel what?

19:37.920 --> 19:39.920
I feel it.

19:44.890 --> 19:46.930
It's close.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.580
Checkmate 0-6. Who has tactical command here?

20:54.670 --> 20:58.040
This is 29-17. I need to know
who has jurisdiction on this site.

21:42.670 --> 21:45.130
<i>Checkmate 0-3, this is Gator 2-3.</i>

21:45.220 --> 21:47.680
<i>We're blind here.</i>

21:47.760 --> 21:51.010
<i>Checkmate 0-6, actual.
Do you copy? Over.</i>

21:52.930 --> 21:55.310
<i>What the hell is that thing?</i>

21:55.430 --> 21:59.810
<i>I need the rules of engagement now!</i>

21:59.900 --> 22:03.940
<i>Target is advancing.
Repeat: Target is advancing.</i>

22:10.410 --> 22:13.200
<i>Sniper team leaders, come back.</i>

22:17.870 --> 22:21.460
- <i>Do not fire!</i>
- <i>It's coming right at us!</i>

22:21.590 --> 22:25.170
- <i>Hold your fire! Hold your fire!</i>
- <i>Do we engage?</i>

22:25.300 --> 22:27.760
- <i>Do not fire!</i>
- <i>Fire! Fire!</i>

22:31.470 --> 22:34.930
- Cease fire!
- All stations, cease fire! Cease fire!

22:35.020 --> 22:36.810
Don't shoot! Do not shoot!

22:44.780 --> 22:47.070
We need a medic!

23:38.870 --> 23:42.160
<i>Klaatu, barada, nikto.</i>

24:12.860 --> 24:16.030
We need that D.N.A. swab.
D.N.A. swab now!

24:16.160 --> 24:18.200
- It's soaking through.
- <i>What's the O2, stat?</i>

24:18.290 --> 24:20.910
Get me the O2, stat!

24:22.210 --> 24:24.120
Go. No one else.

24:29.460 --> 24:31.710
Let's go!

24:35.300 --> 24:38.260
<i>What am I supposed to do now?
Do I start an I.V.?</i>

24:38.350 --> 24:41.270
No. We don't know its physiology.
For all we know, the fluids may kill it.

24:41.350 --> 24:44.690
- <i>What do I do? What do I do?</i>
- Its blood is red. It must have hemoglobin.

24:44.810 --> 24:47.650
- Okay, she's right. Start the drip.
- Okay. I can't find a vein.

24:47.730 --> 24:50.110
- It doesn't have any veins.
- Look for a central line site then.

24:50.190 --> 24:52.280
<i>It's going into cardiac arrest. Defib?</i>

24:52.360 --> 24:55.320
- Yeah. Get in there now. Go! Go!
- Clear!

24:57.450 --> 24:59.370
- <i>Are you okay?</i>
- The monitor shorted out.

24:59.450 --> 25:01.740
Heart rate is stabilizing. It's stabilizing.

25:01.830 --> 25:04.370
<i>What now? What now?</i>

25:06.630 --> 25:08.750
Do you have a surgeon?

25:10.710 --> 25:15.510
Normally for a gunshot,
we'd be using a general anesthetic.

25:15.590 --> 25:19.350
But as we don't know
how the patient will react,

25:19.430 --> 25:24.390
I have opted for a local.

25:26.140 --> 25:29.770
I'm making the first incision... now.

25:33.690 --> 25:35.990
No explosions.

25:36.070 --> 25:39.160
<i>So far, so good.</i>

25:39.240 --> 25:41.410
Pale flesh.

25:41.490 --> 25:43.410
The texture--

25:43.500 --> 25:46.540
Something akin to--
What?

25:46.620 --> 25:49.380
Whale blubber.

25:49.460 --> 25:51.380
I'm taking a specimen now.

25:51.460 --> 25:56.550
Let's pack that on ice and chopper it
to a genomics lab for D.N.A. mapping.

25:56.630 --> 25:58.550
I'd like a sample of that as well.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.180
<i>I am entering the wound.</i>

26:02.430 --> 26:05.270
And--

26:05.350 --> 26:07.350
My God.

26:08.730 --> 26:10.900
What is this? I'm-I'm sorry.

26:10.980 --> 26:13.320
I'm-I'm a little taken aback.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.360
- <i>What's wrong?</i>
- <i>Nothing's wrong.</i>

26:15.440 --> 26:19.110
That's the thing. It's all so familiar.

26:19.200 --> 26:21.870
The outer layer of the flesh
is exotic, it's strange,

26:21.950 --> 26:24.450
<i>but as I go deeper,</i>

26:24.540 --> 26:27.330
<i>there's muscle, vein, nerve, bone.</i>

26:28.420 --> 26:30.330
<i>I'm extracting...</i>

26:30.420 --> 26:32.500
the bullet.

26:38.130 --> 26:39.880
This gray flesh,

26:39.970 --> 26:44.510
it seems to be just falling away.

26:44.600 --> 26:48.560
It's-- It's removing itself.

26:49.980 --> 26:52.690
I think I need to keep extracting it.

26:53.770 --> 26:56.190
<i>Yes. Continue.</i>

26:57.240 --> 26:59.530
Can you explain any of this?

27:54.000 --> 27:57.380
It's dreaming.

27:57.460 --> 27:59.380
Any signs of neural activity?

27:59.460 --> 28:03.220
<i>It lit up the F.M.R.I.
like Times Square.</i>

28:06.470 --> 28:09.220
Get help.

28:09.310 --> 28:12.310
Code white. Subject is conscious.

28:13.810 --> 28:15.810
Help!

28:22.240 --> 28:25.030
It's looking at you.
Try saying something to it.

28:25.160 --> 28:28.620
My name is Dr. Helen Benson.

28:29.700 --> 28:31.620
We're trying to help you.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.120
You have nothing to fear from us.

28:34.210 --> 28:38.170
Help you. Nothing to fear.

28:40.420 --> 28:43.340
<i>Global markets are panicked
in early trading this morning...</i>

28:43.430 --> 28:45.800
<i>in response to the crisis in Central Park.</i>

28:45.890 --> 28:49.850
<i>Trading has been halted on the New York Stock Exchange,
the Nikkei and the Hang Seng...</i>

28:49.930 --> 28:52.060
<i>as Manhattan prepares for a massive evacuation.</i>

28:52.140 --> 28:57.150
<i>In other cities around the world,
people are voluntarily evacuating population centers,</i>

28:57.230 --> 28:59.230
<i>fearing that the sphere in Central Park...</i>

28:59.320 --> 29:01.400
<i>may be the vanguard
of an impending alien invasion.</i>

29:01.480 --> 29:03.400
<i>The president and the vice president...</i>

29:03.490 --> 29:05.650
<i>have been taken to separate
and secure locations.</i>

29:05.740 --> 29:07.990
Until this situation has some kind of resolve,

29:08.070 --> 29:10.160
I am the eyes and the ears of the presidency.

29:11.240 --> 29:13.870
- So, what do we know?
- Madam Secretary,

29:13.960 --> 29:16.830
we lost contact with one of our D.S.C.S.-3
listening satellites...

29:16.960 --> 29:19.630
- orbiting Earth.
- What is that image?

29:19.750 --> 29:23.170
- Are you saying the sphere in Central Park isn't the only one?
- In fact, we have intelligence...

29:23.260 --> 29:26.010
that smaller spheres have landed
at other locations around the world.

29:26.090 --> 29:28.260
Do we have briefings on that?
And where are these spheres right now?

29:28.340 --> 29:31.810
- How is that even possible?
- I think we're asking the wrong questions.

29:31.890 --> 29:34.220
What questions should we be asking?

29:34.310 --> 29:36.940
Well, let's start with this.
Where is our satellite?

29:37.060 --> 29:39.900
- We lost contact with it.
- In the scheme of things,

29:39.980 --> 29:41.980
the loss of one satellite
isn't necessarily our concern.

29:42.070 --> 29:45.440
D.S.C.S.-3 stands for
Defense Systems Communications Satellite.

29:45.530 --> 29:47.780
Remember what it communicates with?

29:47.860 --> 29:50.660
They were able to access our defense mainframe
via that satellite.

29:50.740 --> 29:54.410
That's how they temporarily shut down
our missile defenses and entered our airspace.

29:54.540 --> 29:57.250
- <i>We have changed all the codes.</i>
- And on top of that,

29:57.330 --> 30:00.670
there is a vast amount of vital intelligence
on that mainframe.

30:00.750 --> 30:02.630
They know everything about us now.

30:02.750 --> 30:05.960
- And we know nothing about them.
- Almost nothing.

30:06.050 --> 30:08.300
The fact that they chose
to disable our defenses tells us...

30:08.380 --> 30:10.680
something about their intentions.

30:14.560 --> 30:17.180
Madam Secretary,
we brought in several specialists...

30:17.270 --> 30:19.600
to analyze the tissue samples
we harvested from the being.

30:19.690 --> 30:21.690
This is our chief geneticist,
Dr. Hideo Ikegawa.

30:21.770 --> 30:24.860
This is our chief astrobiologist,
Dr. Helen Benson.

30:24.940 --> 30:27.320
- Hello.
- <i>Doctor?</i>

30:27.400 --> 30:29.570
The being is in a nascent state.

30:29.660 --> 30:33.990
The D.N.A. samples we've taken seem to represent
three distinct life forms.

30:34.080 --> 30:35.990
Three different D.N.A. types?

30:36.080 --> 30:38.710
<i>Yes, including the being's brain.</i>

30:38.790 --> 30:42.040
The body tissue is human,
as far as we can tell.

30:42.130 --> 30:45.670
The gray flesh encasing it
is organic material.

30:45.760 --> 30:47.800
Some kind of bioengineered space suit.

30:47.880 --> 30:51.340
What it resembles, oddly enough,
is placental tissue.

30:51.430 --> 30:54.680
Which makes sense, given that placenta's
a life-support system.

30:54.760 --> 30:57.060
And that basically, in order to survive
in our environment,

30:57.140 --> 30:59.100
the being had to be born here...

30:59.190 --> 31:01.520
in its human form.

31:01.600 --> 31:05.480
They must've come here in the past
and obtained a D.N.A. sample from a human subject.

31:05.570 --> 31:07.570
Now, since that birth,

31:07.650 --> 31:10.320
the being has grown exponentially.

31:10.410 --> 31:13.160
This is one hour after surgery.

31:13.240 --> 31:14.950
<i>Three hours.</i>

31:17.000 --> 31:19.080
- Six hours.
- How much can you tell us about it...

31:19.210 --> 31:22.790
- by decoding its D.N.A.?
- <i>Um, you don't understand.</i>

31:22.880 --> 31:25.500
These are the Dead Sea Scrolls.
Geneticists...

31:25.630 --> 31:28.460
- are gonna be studying this code for generations.
- No, they aren't.

31:28.550 --> 31:33.390
This code is the property of the U.S. government.
Its very existence is classified.

31:33.470 --> 31:35.470
I wanna see it.

31:46.570 --> 31:48.440
Water.

31:48.570 --> 31:52.200
- Bring him up.
- Does it actually speak our language,

31:52.280 --> 31:54.660
or does it just parrot what it's heard?

31:54.740 --> 31:57.330
No, it seems to already understand our language.

31:57.410 --> 31:59.750
<i>They've compromised our satellites.
They know everything about us.</i>

31:59.830 --> 32:02.080
Mr. Driscoll.

32:28.070 --> 32:29.980
<i>My name is Regina Jackson.</i>

32:30.070 --> 32:34.200
I'm the secretary of defense
of the United States of America.

32:36.370 --> 32:39.080
This body will take some getting used to.

32:45.330 --> 32:48.500
I've been sent here to determine who
or what you represent...

32:48.590 --> 32:50.960
and what your intentions are.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.760
It feels unreal to me.

32:57.300 --> 32:59.220
Alien.

33:02.230 --> 33:04.350
It'll take time to adapt.

33:05.400 --> 33:08.440
What were you... before you were human?

33:12.030 --> 33:13.940
Different.

33:14.030 --> 33:15.950
Different how?

33:17.070 --> 33:19.570
It would only frighten you.

33:21.660 --> 33:25.370
- Do you have a name?
- Klaatu.

33:27.750 --> 33:30.130
Do you represent a civilization?

33:33.090 --> 33:35.630
I represent a group of civilizations.

33:35.720 --> 33:40.100
- Where is this group of civilizations?
- All around you.

33:40.180 --> 33:43.060
<i>What is your purpose in coming here?</i>

33:43.140 --> 33:47.310
There is a gathering of world leaders
not far from here.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.520
I will explain my purpose to them.

33:49.610 --> 33:52.690
I'm afraid that's not possible.

33:52.780 --> 33:55.610
Perhaps you should explain yourself
to me instead.

33:55.700 --> 33:58.700
Do you speak for the entire human race?

33:58.780 --> 34:01.620
I speak for the president of the United States.

34:04.790 --> 34:06.750
<i>Now, please, tell me.</i>

34:06.830 --> 34:09.290
Why have you come to our planet?

34:11.630 --> 34:14.050
- Your planet?
- Yes.

34:14.130 --> 34:16.170
This is our planet.

34:18.429 --> 34:20.550
No. It is not.

34:21.600 --> 34:25.389
We've decided to sedate him
and move him to a more secure location.

34:25.480 --> 34:28.060
- Are you going to interrogate him?
- That's a possibility.

34:28.139 --> 34:31.100
Madam Secretary, as scientists,
we can't consent to this.

34:31.190 --> 34:33.860
He says he wants to speak to the U.N.

34:33.940 --> 34:37.150
History has lessons to teach us
about first encounters...

34:37.239 --> 34:39.150
between civilizations.

34:39.239 --> 34:43.120
As a rule, the less-advanced civilization
is either exterminated or enslaved.

34:43.199 --> 34:45.909
I'm thinking of Pizarro and the Incas,

34:46.000 --> 34:49.540
Columbus and the Native Americans,
and the list goes on.

34:49.620 --> 34:52.290
Unfortunately, in this case,

34:52.380 --> 34:54.290
the less-advanced civilization is us.

34:54.380 --> 34:58.170
This is a representative
of an extraterrestrial civilization.

34:58.260 --> 35:01.470
This is the most important discovery
in the history of mankind.

35:01.550 --> 35:04.260
It may well be the last discovery
in the history of mankind.

35:04.350 --> 35:07.770
<i>We need to know what they're planning,
and we need to know now.</i>

35:07.850 --> 35:11.480
<i>So you wanna drug him?
Interrogate him? I'm sorry.</i>

35:11.600 --> 35:15.360
- We won't do that. You understand?
- I understand completely.

35:15.440 --> 35:18.690
Of course, if you won't do it,
we'll have to call in someone who will.

35:18.780 --> 35:21.400
<i>Well, I'm sure you can find
someone who will help you with--</i>

35:21.490 --> 35:25.080
- I'll do it.
- Helen.

35:26.160 --> 35:28.580
I'll do it.

35:52.440 --> 35:54.350
That won't be necessary, Doctor.

35:54.440 --> 35:58.230
We've already prepared the solution for you.

36:00.070 --> 36:02.240
I just need a syringe.

36:12.580 --> 36:14.500
<i>I want to apologize to you.</i>

36:14.580 --> 36:17.670
<i>It seems we got off to a bad start.</i>

36:17.800 --> 36:20.550
- It seems we did.
- We're going to transport you...

36:20.630 --> 36:23.380
to a different facility
for better medical care.

36:23.470 --> 36:25.050
No, you are not.

36:25.140 --> 36:27.260
Excuse me?

36:27.390 --> 36:30.520
- I am leaving.
- I can't allow you to do that.

36:30.600 --> 36:35.150
- It is not up to you.
- <i>This is a military installation.</i>

36:35.230 --> 36:38.440
<i>You're surrounded by hundreds of soldiers.
There's no leaving here.</i>

36:38.520 --> 36:40.360
I have done nothing wrong.

36:40.440 --> 36:42.780
You invaded our airspace.

36:42.860 --> 36:47.370
That... automaton that emerged from the sphere,
it attacked our troops.

36:47.450 --> 36:49.450
It acted to defend me.

36:49.540 --> 36:52.120
It activates in the presence of violence.

36:52.210 --> 36:54.870
Dr. Benson, please.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.440
Run.

37:19.400 --> 37:21.400
It's done.

37:23.030 --> 37:24.650
If you'll come with us, ma'am.

37:48.340 --> 37:50.510
Keep moving, please.

38:40.060 --> 38:43.060
I'm going to ask you
a series of control questions.

38:47.780 --> 38:52.450
Are you currently in a seated position?

38:52.530 --> 38:54.120
Yes.

38:54.200 --> 38:56.490
Are you human?

38:58.000 --> 39:01.000
My body is.

39:01.080 --> 39:04.090
Do you feel pain?

39:04.170 --> 39:06.630
My body does.

39:11.300 --> 39:13.890
Are you aware of an impending attack...

39:13.970 --> 39:16.640
on the planet Earth?

39:19.730 --> 39:21.640
You should let me go.

39:28.440 --> 39:30.530
I'll repeat the question.

39:56.640 --> 39:59.560
What gate did you use to enter this base?

39:59.680 --> 40:03.140
- East loading door.
- How do I get there?

40:03.230 --> 40:06.560
100 yards left from the back of this building.

40:06.650 --> 40:08.980
Is there a security code?

40:10.570 --> 40:13.610
Four-four-bravo-three-zero.

40:13.700 --> 40:15.990
What size is that suit?

40:16.120 --> 40:19.080
- Forty-two long.
- Take it off.

40:58.910 --> 41:02.750
<i>Attention. All security personnel,
report to your designated posts.</i>

41:02.830 --> 41:06.580
<i>All civilian personnel
report to Operations immediately.</i>

41:15.630 --> 41:17.550
I'm leaving you now.

41:17.640 --> 41:19.390
No.

41:47.500 --> 41:49.460
<i>Put every arm of the government--</i>

41:49.540 --> 41:53.050
<i>military, law enforcement, federal, state and local--
on high alert.</i>

41:53.170 --> 41:56.010
- If the media gets word that we've lost the being--
- Use a cover story.

41:56.090 --> 41:59.680
We can't risk a panic.
Call him an escaped convict.

41:59.760 --> 42:03.060
Use every surveillance satellite,
every drone aircraft,

42:03.140 --> 42:04.720
<i>every freeway camera.</i>

42:04.810 --> 42:07.140
<i>Use every resource we've got.</i>

42:13.280 --> 42:15.530
<i>Attention: All scheduled trains...</i>

42:15.610 --> 42:20.030
<i>into and out of Penn Station
to Manhattan are canceled...</i>

42:20.120 --> 42:23.830
<i>due to the security perimeter
in Central Park.</i>

42:38.090 --> 42:40.220
Excuse me. Excuse me.

42:44.010 --> 42:47.520
<i>We are committed to providing you
with quality service.</i>

42:47.600 --> 42:49.770
<i>Thank you.</i>

42:55.070 --> 42:57.860
<i>We ask that our passengers
remain calm and orderly...</i>

42:57.950 --> 43:00.410
<i>during these difficult circumstances.</i>

43:05.790 --> 43:10.420
<i>Any disturbance will be subject
to immediate arrest by transit police.</i>

43:10.500 --> 43:12.380
Let's go.

43:12.500 --> 43:14.670
- Back off.
- Don't push me!

43:14.800 --> 43:16.880
- <i>Look, I'm warning you.
- <i>I don't--</i></i>

43:16.970 --> 43:19.920
- <i>Just give me the ticket!</i>
- <i>I'm not giving you anything. Just--</i>

43:20.010 --> 43:25.100
Give me the--
What's the matter with you?

43:33.690 --> 43:36.480
- Hey!
- Go and get him.

43:38.820 --> 43:41.780
- <i>We have a man down.</i>
- <i>Unrest is causing leaders around the world...</i>

43:41.860 --> 43:45.160
<i>to criticize the U.S. response
to the arrival of the spheres.</i>

43:45.240 --> 43:47.160
<i>Reactions from both national...</i>

43:47.240 --> 43:50.290
<i>and international religious communities
have been varied.</i>

43:50.370 --> 43:53.290
<i>While some have responded with hope and measured optimism,
most religious communities...</i>

43:53.380 --> 43:56.210
<i>have considered recent events
to be apocalyptic.</i>

43:56.300 --> 43:59.800
<i>At gatherings and prayer vigils
in virtually every major city,</i>

43:59.880 --> 44:02.090
<i>many see the arrival
of the Central Park sphere...</i>

44:02.180 --> 44:05.300
<i>as a sign of a new era,
or perhaps even the end of the world.</i>

44:27.450 --> 44:30.080
<i>Leaders around the world are protesting
the U.S.'s decision...</i>

44:30.160 --> 44:33.790
<i>to deny foreign scientists
full access to the being.</i>

44:33.870 --> 44:35.790
<i>Have you done your homework?</i>

44:35.880 --> 44:39.000
School's canceled on account of the aliens.

44:39.130 --> 44:41.210
- <i>They say it's an invasion.</i>
- Well, they're wrong.

44:41.300 --> 44:43.930
- What makes you so sure?
- I just know.

44:44.050 --> 44:46.220
Don't get that!

44:46.350 --> 44:48.550
- Jacob!
- Hello?

44:48.640 --> 44:51.970
- <i>May I speak to Dr. Helen Benson, please?</i>
- It's for you.

44:54.900 --> 44:56.690
Hello?

44:56.770 --> 44:59.270
- <i>Dr. Helen Benson?</i>
- Yes.

44:59.360 --> 45:01.320
<i>I'm calling from Newark Penn Station.</i>

45:01.400 --> 45:03.610
I've got your patient here.

45:03.700 --> 45:07.200
Oh. Um, sorry.
I think there's been a mistake.

45:07.280 --> 45:09.530
<i>Um, I'm not that kind of a doctor.</i>

45:09.620 --> 45:11.830
<i>Hold-Hold on a second.</i>

45:11.910 --> 45:14.370
<i>He says you got his medicine.</i>

45:14.460 --> 45:17.790
I'll be right there.

45:25.260 --> 45:27.140
<i>Attention, all passengers.</i>

45:27.260 --> 45:29.930
Excuse me!

45:30.010 --> 45:33.220
Excuse me. I'm sorry. Somebody called me.
My name's Dr. Benson.

45:33.310 --> 45:35.390
Good. He's over there.
He's your problem now.

45:35.480 --> 45:38.600
<i>Go ahead, take him. He's your problem.</i>

45:43.990 --> 45:47.410
<i>I need my bag!</i>

45:47.490 --> 45:50.280
<i>It's a black bag.</i>

45:50.370 --> 45:54.620
<i>Evacuation registration point
located two blocks this way.</i>

45:54.710 --> 45:57.080
You know, I took a huge risk
back at the hospital.

45:57.210 --> 46:00.500
Did I make a mistake?

46:00.590 --> 46:03.710
Are you a friend to us?

46:03.800 --> 46:06.010
I'm a friend to the Earth.

46:09.010 --> 46:12.180
<i>Let's keep it steady, folks.
Let's keep going forward.</i>

46:19.190 --> 46:21.980
- Hello.
- Hi.

46:22.070 --> 46:25.650
Okay. Now what?

46:25.740 --> 46:27.700
Drive.

46:44.420 --> 46:46.420
Look in your pocket.

46:49.050 --> 46:51.050
Your inside pocket.

47:21.210 --> 47:23.750
Turn left.

47:38.930 --> 47:42.190
<i>Striker two-eight-two-niner,
descend and maintain 2,000...</i>

47:42.270 --> 47:44.310
<i>to establish the vectors
to the target area.</i>

47:44.400 --> 47:47.110
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

47:47.190 --> 47:49.900
All right, everybody, we got our mission!

47:49.990 --> 47:52.950
All right. Target acquired and confirmed, sir.
We are locked on.

47:53.030 --> 47:56.030
<i>Madam Secretary,
they're sending in the drones.</i>

47:56.120 --> 47:58.200
Bring in the reapers! We are go!

47:58.290 --> 48:01.460
- Roger that. Descending to 1,200.
- Let's light this thing up.

48:08.210 --> 48:10.510
<i>That's affirmative. In motion now.</i>

48:10.590 --> 48:15.050
- <i>Ground forces have been activated.</i>
- Arm your Sidewinder missiles.

48:15.140 --> 48:18.350
<i>Roger that, Colonel.
Sidewinder missiles armed.</i>

48:26.570 --> 48:30.150
- He's activating.
- Fire! Fire, fire!

48:35.070 --> 48:36.820
- Missiles intercepted!
- Get out of there!

48:36.950 --> 48:40.370
- <i>Withdraw and realign for another sortie.</i>
- <i>Negative!</i>

48:40.450 --> 48:43.210
I've lost link! I've lost control!

48:45.670 --> 48:47.380
Who's in control of the aircraft then?

48:49.130 --> 48:53.050
<i>Striker 2-8 headed for "R" perimeter.
I am out of control!</i>

49:03.350 --> 49:05.560
Anyone got any other ideas?

49:05.770 --> 49:09.650
<i>Why are people running?</i>

49:09.730 --> 49:12.820
We should stay and fight.

49:12.900 --> 49:15.280
They didn't come here to hurt us.

49:15.360 --> 49:18.950
Well, we should kill 'em anyway,
just to make sure.

49:19.030 --> 49:21.040
- <i>Don't say that.</i>
- <i>That's what Dad would've done.</i>

49:22.660 --> 49:26.330
- I think he would've looked for a different way.
- He would've fought.

49:27.500 --> 49:29.420
I like to think I knew him pretty well.

49:29.500 --> 49:31.880
I knew him too, longer than you.

49:33.550 --> 49:36.630
- What do you think?
- Of what?

49:36.720 --> 49:39.390
Should people run,
or should we stay and fight?

49:40.430 --> 49:43.470
- Neither.
- <i>What should we do then?</i>

49:43.560 --> 49:45.520
There's nothing you can do.

49:47.310 --> 49:51.230
This is it. Pull in here.

50:00.410 --> 50:02.410
McDonald's?

50:03.950 --> 50:05.830
Where are you going?

50:05.960 --> 50:09.420
- <i>Jacob, where are you going?</i>
- To the bathroom.

50:13.260 --> 50:15.260
Where is the boy's father?

50:17.430 --> 50:19.300
He's dead.

50:19.430 --> 50:23.140
- How did he die?
- He was in the army.

50:23.220 --> 50:26.600
So the boy wishes his soldier father were here...

50:26.690 --> 50:28.940
to rescue the world from the aliens?

50:29.020 --> 50:32.690
The boy wishes his father were here
for a lot of reasons,

50:32.770 --> 50:35.110
aliens being the least of them.

50:37.900 --> 50:40.530
He wasn't even that kind of a soldier.

50:40.620 --> 50:45.160
He was an engineer.
He went over there to build,

50:45.290 --> 50:48.290
- not to fight.
- And his mother?

50:50.500 --> 50:52.590
She died when he was a baby.

50:54.130 --> 50:58.760
I married his father, and... a year ago,
he was killed.

51:02.390 --> 51:04.310
Why did you come here?

51:05.850 --> 51:08.180
I came to save the Earth.

51:09.310 --> 51:13.440
- From what?
- He's here.

51:20.490 --> 51:23.870
<i>And number 44. Forty-four's ready.</i>

51:24.030 --> 51:26.990
Your tea, Grandfather.

51:27.080 --> 51:29.080
Thank you.

51:40.180 --> 51:42.430
Are you one of them?

51:42.510 --> 51:44.890
One of who?

51:44.970 --> 51:47.560
No. Never mind. Sorry.

51:48.930 --> 51:51.440
You've been out of contact
for a long time.

51:51.520 --> 51:53.980
I had a dangerous assignment.

51:54.690 --> 51:56.860
This is hostile territory.

51:56.940 --> 51:58.440
I've noticed.

51:58.530 --> 52:01.780
I was hoping I could reason with them.

52:01.860 --> 52:05.240
I'm afraid they are not a reasonable race.

52:06.410 --> 52:10.450
I've been living amongst them
for seventy years now.

52:10.540 --> 52:12.370
I know them well.

52:13.670 --> 52:14.880
And?

52:14.960 --> 52:18.250
Any attempt to intercede with them
would be futile.

52:18.340 --> 52:20.880
They are destructive,

52:21.590 --> 52:23.720
and they won't change.

52:25.050 --> 52:28.640
Is that your official report?

52:28.720 --> 52:33.980
The tragedy is, they know
what's going to become of them.

52:35.770 --> 52:37.270
They sense it.

52:37.360 --> 52:41.530
But they can't seem to do anything about it.

52:47.030 --> 52:50.580
It's decided then.

52:50.660 --> 52:53.870
I'll begin the process as soon as possible.

52:53.960 --> 52:57.170
We should make preparations
for our departure.

52:57.250 --> 52:59.590
I'm staying.

52:59.670 --> 53:01.840
<i>You can't stay here.</i>

53:01.920 --> 53:04.180
I can, and I will.

53:04.260 --> 53:06.340
If you stay, you'll die.

53:06.430 --> 53:09.010
<i>I know.</i>

53:09.100 --> 53:11.310
<i>This is my home now.</i>

53:12.930 --> 53:16.060
You yourself called them a destructive race.

53:16.150 --> 53:18.520
<i>That's true.</i>

53:18.610 --> 53:22.860
<i>But still, there is another side.</i>

53:22.940 --> 53:26.450
You see, I-- I love them.

53:28.580 --> 53:32.660
This is a very strange thing.

53:32.750 --> 53:36.210
I-I-I can't find a way to explain it to you.

53:36.290 --> 53:38.460
For many years, I--

53:38.540 --> 53:41.840
I cursed my luck for being sent here.

53:41.920 --> 53:45.760
Human life is difficult.

53:45.840 --> 53:50.180
But as this life is coming to an end,

53:50.260 --> 53:54.430
I consider myself lucky...
to have lived it.

53:58.690 --> 54:00.610
<i>Copy that, Base.</i>

54:00.690 --> 54:03.360
No sudden movements, no aggressive actions.

54:03.440 --> 54:06.400
No matter what happens, no gunfire.

54:06.490 --> 54:09.320
Track is in place, sir.
Containment panels are in position.

54:09.450 --> 54:11.990
- We're ready on your order.
- On my command,

54:13.450 --> 54:15.330
move the panels into place.

54:15.460 --> 54:17.080
- Three.
- <i>Three.</i>

54:17.210 --> 54:18.420
- Two.
- <i>Two.</i>

54:18.500 --> 54:19.880
One.

54:19.960 --> 54:22.540
<i>Synchronize established.
I.S.I. ready to copy.</i>

54:31.260 --> 54:33.760
<i>Containment panels are secure.</i>

54:33.890 --> 54:38.350
<i>And... we're still here.</i>

54:44.860 --> 54:47.440
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

54:47.530 --> 54:50.410
<i>The escaped convict they showed on the news,
I just saw the guy at the gas station.</i>

54:50.530 --> 54:52.450
- <i>Can you describe him?</i>
- <i>He was in a little car.</i>

54:52.530 --> 54:55.040
<i>911. What is your emergency.</i>

54:55.120 --> 54:57.120
<i>I just saw that wanted man
over by the McDonald's.</i>

54:57.210 --> 54:59.080
<i>Can you give me
a description of the car?</i>

54:59.210 --> 55:02.000
- <i>A silver four-door with a woman and a kid.</i>
- <i>I need three units...</i>

55:02.130 --> 55:04.250
- <i>to look for a silver Honda near Ochada orchard.</i>
- <i>Unit one responding.</i>

55:04.380 --> 55:08.090
- <i>We are patrolling the orchards off I-67.</i>
- <i>HP-28 to follow up.</i>

55:08.170 --> 55:10.550
This is it.

55:10.640 --> 55:12.850
Stop here.

55:12.930 --> 55:15.810
Should--

55:20.230 --> 55:23.110
Uh, Helen, who is this guy?

55:23.230 --> 55:25.400
- <i>A friend.</i>
- What kind of friend?

55:28.150 --> 55:31.320
Scootch over. He's a work friend.

55:32.820 --> 55:36.290
- What's his name?
- Klaatu.

55:36.410 --> 55:38.000
- Klaatu?
- Yeah.

55:38.080 --> 55:40.580
What kind of name is that?

55:40.670 --> 55:43.170
It's foreign, I think.

55:43.290 --> 55:46.170
I never heard you talk about him before.

55:46.250 --> 55:48.840
Well, I haven't known him for very long.

55:48.920 --> 55:51.510
We're just giving him a ride.

55:51.590 --> 55:54.640
Where?

55:54.760 --> 55:57.220
- Here.
- The forest?

56:02.730 --> 56:04.900
Stay here.
I want you to lock the door, okay?

56:04.980 --> 56:07.860
And don't open it for anyone but me.

56:07.940 --> 56:09.940
I'm serious.

58:47.230 --> 58:49.980
Helen, what's going on?

58:55.990 --> 58:58.320
<i>We're getting images of these spheres
from all over the world.</i>

58:58.450 --> 59:01.780
- Okavango, Gobi, Baku.
- Which of our agencies gathered this intel?

59:01.870 --> 59:03.780
Ma'am, none of them.
We pulled these off the Internet.

59:10.790 --> 59:14.590
Is that... them?

59:14.670 --> 59:16.090
No.

59:16.170 --> 59:20.090
It's us.
Those are ordinary cephalopods.

59:21.470 --> 59:23.470
Squid. Octopus.

59:25.640 --> 59:29.730
<i>I don't like him. He's weird, and--</i>

59:29.850 --> 59:33.980
- Why are we driving him around anyway?
- Um--

59:35.980 --> 59:37.570
It's complicated.

59:37.650 --> 59:40.030
Is he comin' home with us?

59:40.110 --> 59:42.860
No. No.

59:42.950 --> 59:46.830
Well, what if you decide you like him,
and he wants to move in?

59:46.910 --> 59:48.950
No, it's not like that.
God, no!

59:49.040 --> 59:50.960
Listen to me.

59:51.040 --> 59:53.420
No one is moving in.
You don't understand.

59:53.540 --> 59:57.800
- Whatever. You wait for him. I'm goin' home.
- Jacob.

01:00:02.590 --> 01:00:08.100
Jacob!

01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:10.980
What is the matter with you?

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.350
<i>These spheres now appear to be leaving...</i>

01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:49.430
<i>in the same mysterious manner as they came.</i>

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:52.060
<i>Hopefully, this mass exodus
will bring an end to the panic and unrest...</i>

01:00:52.140 --> 01:00:53.810
<i>we've been seeing around the world.</i>

01:00:53.900 --> 01:00:55.980
<i>The only sphere that
doesn't appear to be leaving...</i>

01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:58.020
<i>is the giant sphere in Central Park.</i>

01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:01.490
You think we scared 'em off?

01:01:02.490 --> 01:01:04.610
They're not afraid of us.

01:01:17.210 --> 01:01:19.130
I need to get back to the city.

01:01:19.210 --> 01:01:21.670
Not until you tell me what's going on.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:24.420
- Did you do that?
- Yes.

01:01:24.550 --> 01:01:28.800
- <i>Jacob, get in the car.</i>
- He's one of them.

01:01:28.890 --> 01:01:30.430
Please, get in the car.

01:01:31.890 --> 01:01:34.180
Get in the car.

01:01:45.360 --> 01:01:47.280
I need to know what's happening.

01:01:48.410 --> 01:01:50.660
This planet is dying.

01:01:50.740 --> 01:01:52.700
The human race is killing it.

01:01:52.790 --> 01:01:55.120
So you've come here to help us?

01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:58.330
No, I didn't.

01:02:00.800 --> 01:02:02.630
You said you came to save us.

01:02:02.710 --> 01:02:05.300
I said I came to save the Earth.

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:08.840
You came to save the Earth...

01:02:08.930 --> 01:02:11.720
from us.

01:02:11.810 --> 01:02:15.180
You came to save the Earth from us?

01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:18.600
We can't risk the survival of this planet
for the sake of one species.

01:02:18.730 --> 01:02:22.270
- What are you saying?
- If the Earth dies, you die.

01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:25.440
If you die, the Earth survives.

01:02:25.530 --> 01:02:28.160
There are only a handful of planets
in the cosmos...

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.570
that are capable of supporting complex life.

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:33.990
- You can't do this.
- This one can't be allowed to perish.

01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.330
We can change.
We can still turn things around.

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.830
We've watched, we've waited
and hoped that you would change.

01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.380
- Please.
- It's reached the tipping point.

01:02:41.500 --> 01:02:43.130
- We have to act.
- Please!

01:02:43.210 --> 01:02:46.260
We'll undo the damage you've done
and give the Earth a chance to begin again.

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:48.840
Don't do this.

01:02:48.930 --> 01:02:51.430
Please! We could change.

01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:53.680
<i>We can change.</i>

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:58.980
The decision is made.
The process has begun.

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:02.980
Oh, God.

01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:11.620
<i>Adam 85 confirming.</i>

01:03:11.700 --> 01:03:13.660
<i>10-4, Central.</i>

01:03:19.170 --> 01:03:21.080
It won't make any difference, Helen.

01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:23.170
Even if they arrest me,

01:03:23.250 --> 01:03:26.920
even if they kill me,
the process will continue.

01:03:27.010 --> 01:03:30.550
Both of you, hands on the car, right now!

01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:32.260
Is that a child in the car?

01:03:32.390 --> 01:03:35.890
- Yes.
- <i>This is HP-28.</i>

01:03:35.970 --> 01:03:39.390
I'm on I-67.
I have the F.B.I. suspect in custody,

01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.810
along with one adult female
and one child.

01:03:41.900 --> 01:03:44.560
- <i>Awaiting instructions.</i>
- <i>7-0-140. Roger.</i>

01:03:44.650 --> 01:03:46.940
Tell the child to get out of the car.

01:03:47.070 --> 01:03:50.150
- <i>Get the kid out of the car!</i>
- Honey, come on.

01:03:51.860 --> 01:03:54.030
<i>Okay, you two, over there.</i>

01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:56.030
<i>You, I'm not gonna tell you again.</i>

01:03:56.120 --> 01:03:58.410
- Hands on the car.
- Please don't hurt him.

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:01.920
- I'm not gonna hurt him, so long as he--
- I wasn't talking to you.

01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:05.790
The pain will only last a moment.

01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:23.020
You killed him! You killed him!

01:04:23.150 --> 01:04:25.730
- Jacob. Jacob!
- Let me finish.

01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.820
- You killed him! You killed him!
- Shh. Shh. Come here.

01:04:28.940 --> 01:04:32.320
- You killed him!
- All right. Sit down.

01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:34.700
- <i>He killed him!</i>
- <i>Shh!</i>

01:04:34.780 --> 01:04:36.780
<i>He killed him!</i>

01:05:17.330 --> 01:05:19.330
He'll be all right.

01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:26.250
I don't understand.

01:05:26.330 --> 01:05:30.800
You're gonna kill us all,
but you saved him.

01:05:30.880 --> 01:05:33.380
He was an obstacle.
I meant him no harm.

01:05:35.430 --> 01:05:39.470
You could stop this, couldn't you,
if you wanted to?

01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:43.480
I tried to reason with you.
I tried to speak with your leaders.

01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.600
Those aren't our leaders.

01:05:45.690 --> 01:05:48.270
You wanna speak to one of our leaders,
I'll take you to one.

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:50.860
<i>Let me take you.</i>

01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:58.370
Get in the car.

01:06:00.030 --> 01:06:02.910
Maybe they were just collecting specimens
from our planet.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.910
It's not our planet.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:07.580
That what he said to me in the hospital.

01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:13.670
An ark.

01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:16.630
- <i>Excuse me?</i>
- It's an ark.

01:06:16.720 --> 01:06:18.680
So are all the other spheres.

01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:21.260
They're saving as many species
as they can.

01:06:21.390 --> 01:06:27.270
- If the sphere is an ark, then what comes next is--
- The flood.

01:06:49.830 --> 01:06:51.840
Karl, we're here.

01:06:55.590 --> 01:06:57.760
Okay, let's get you settled.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.770
<i>That's a Nobel Prize.</i>

01:07:08.850 --> 01:07:13.020
<i>He won it for his work
in biological altruism.</i>

01:07:13.110 --> 01:07:16.150
Probably still be in his desk drawer
if I hadn't gotten it framed for him.

01:07:19.450 --> 01:07:22.450
- You tired?
- Just a little.

01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:27.580
Close, but no.

01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:35.500
I wouldn't--

01:07:35.590 --> 01:07:37.670
He won't mind.

01:07:42.930 --> 01:07:46.470
He's one of them.
You shouldn't be helping him.

01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:48.560
We should stop him.

01:07:53.400 --> 01:07:58.110
For just this once,
I need you to trust me.

01:08:40.689 --> 01:08:43.319
Is it possible?

01:08:58.090 --> 01:09:01.380
I have so many questions to ask you.

01:09:15.479 --> 01:09:17.189
It's Bach.

01:09:20.609 --> 01:09:22.529
It's beautiful.

01:09:22.609 --> 01:09:25.240
So we're not so different after all.

01:09:27.069 --> 01:09:29.950
I wish that were true.

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:35.790
<i>So is it a machine, or a living thing?</i>

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:38.960
- It's both. Or... neither.
- What do you mean, neither?

01:09:39.040 --> 01:09:41.750
It seems to be some sort of
silicone-based hybrid.

01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:45.220
We're calling it GORT--
Genetically Organized Robotic Technology.

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:47.300
Oh, the military and their acronyms.

01:09:47.390 --> 01:09:49.510
We've used every diagnostic method available--

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:51.760
M.R.I., thermal imaging, PET scan.

01:09:51.850 --> 01:09:54.350
But it was impervious.
So we attempted...

01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:56.560
a robotically-assisted exploration
using a diamond drill.

01:09:56.690 --> 01:09:58.610
- And?
- The drill bit fractured.

01:09:58.690 --> 01:10:00.610
It'll take 24 hours to fix it robotically.

01:10:44.690 --> 01:10:47.240
Colonel, we don't have 24 hours.

01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:50.200
Send somebody in there
to fix that drill.

01:10:50.410 --> 01:10:53.280
<i>Food and fuel hoarding
have led to shortages,</i>

01:10:53.370 --> 01:10:56.330
<i>which erupted into looting incidents
throughout Asia and South America.</i>

01:10:56.410 --> 01:10:58.210
<i>Outbreaks of rioting...</i>

01:10:58.290 --> 01:11:01.920
<i>and unrest in such cities
as Guangdong, China, London and Chicago...</i>

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.510
<i>due to the shortages of such basic commodities
as fuel, food and drinking water.</i>

01:11:07.590 --> 01:11:10.430
<i>Many point to the Central Park sphere as--</i>

01:11:10.510 --> 01:11:13.100
<i>Amidst the chaos in the
New York-NewJersey areas,</i>

01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:18.140
<i>local police are looking for an escaped convict
whose name is not being released.</i>

01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:22.020
<i>Authorities believe that he is
a significant threat to the public...</i>

01:11:22.110 --> 01:11:25.530
<i>and are asking for any information
that could lead to his capture.</i>

01:11:25.610 --> 01:11:29.490
<i>If you have seen this man,
please contact the number on your screen below.</i>

01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:33.870
There must be alternatives.
You must have some technology that can solve our problem.

01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:36.410
Your problem is not technology.

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:37.790
The problem is you.

01:11:37.870 --> 01:11:41.790
- You lack the will to change.
- Then help us change.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:43.790
I cannot change your nature.

01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.130
You treat the world
as you treat each other.

01:11:46.210 --> 01:11:50.470
But every civilization reaches
a crisis point eventually.

01:11:50.590 --> 01:11:54.350
- <i>Most of them don't make it.</i>
- Yours did. How?

01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:57.680
Our sun was dying.
We had to evolve in order to survive.

01:11:57.770 --> 01:12:00.810
So it was only when your world
was threatened with destruction...

01:12:00.890 --> 01:12:02.900
that you became what you are now.

01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:05.980
- Yes.
- Well, that's where we are.

01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:09.150
You say we're on the brink of destruction,
and you're right.

01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:11.900
But it's only on the brink...

01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:14.030
that people find the will to change.

01:12:14.120 --> 01:12:17.120
Only at the precipice do we evolve.

01:12:18.540 --> 01:12:20.500
<i>This is our moment.</i>

01:12:20.580 --> 01:12:23.880
<i>Don't take it from us.
We are close to an answer.</i>

01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:32.220
What's wrong?

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:55.030
Jacob. Can you get your boots on?

01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.370
He can't get caught.

01:12:57.490 --> 01:12:59.740
- What do I do?
- Change his mind.

01:12:59.830 --> 01:13:02.660
Not with reason, but with yourself.

01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:16.720
<i>It's too late for that.</i>

01:13:46.500 --> 01:13:49.090
Jacob!

01:13:49.170 --> 01:13:51.300
Down here! He's here!

01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:53.550
- Down here! Down here!
- What are you doing?

01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:55.590
- He's here!
- What are you doing?

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:59.350
- I'm trying to help them! That's why I called them.
- What?

01:13:59.470 --> 01:14:01.640
- I told them where we are.
- Jacob, you didn't!

01:14:01.720 --> 01:14:03.600
We shouldn't be helping him.

01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:06.190
Jacob, I'm trying to help us.

01:14:06.270 --> 01:14:08.600
We should kill him!
That's what Dad would've done.

01:14:08.690 --> 01:14:10.650
You fight me on everything.
On everything!

01:14:10.770 --> 01:14:14.070
- If my dad were here--
- But he isn't here! He's gone!

01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:22.540
Jacob--

01:14:24.370 --> 01:14:27.830
<i>We've extracted the female.
Returning to base.</i>

01:14:37.090 --> 01:14:41.180
- <i>Got a visual on the male.</i>
- <i>Yeah, I see him.</i>

01:14:41.260 --> 01:14:45.100
<i>Yep. Got it. Target acquired.
Permission to engage.</i>

01:14:46.850 --> 01:14:48.810
<i>You are clear to engage.</i>

01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:52.230
- <i>You are go to take out the target.</i>
- <i>Roger that.</i>

01:15:31.190 --> 01:15:34.400
Please don't hurt me!

01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:45.080
Thanks.

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:54.130
I don't know where we are.

01:16:00.630 --> 01:16:03.140
Can you help me get home?

01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:10.020
This way.

01:16:51.850 --> 01:16:55.650
- He's come here to exterminate us, hasn't he?
- You can't stop him.

01:16:55.730 --> 01:16:58.230
The only chance we have is
if he changes his mind.

01:16:58.320 --> 01:17:00.530
You have to let me talk to him.

01:17:00.610 --> 01:17:02.530
What makes you think he'll listen to you?

01:17:02.610 --> 01:17:04.530
I don't know that he will.

01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:07.780
But I think he trusts me,
and I don't think he wants to do this.

01:17:07.870 --> 01:17:09.740
We have the situation under control.

01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:12.370
Madam Secretary, General Quinn
needs to see you in the briefing room.

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:16.710
- He says it's urgent.
- You're not in control.

01:17:18.210 --> 01:17:19.920
You don't know what he's capable of!

01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:24.380
<i>But she didn't do anything wrong.
So they should let her go, right?</i>

01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:28.890
You're afraid you're going
to be left alone.

01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:33.430
I already am alone. Helen's just someone
that was stuck with me when my dad died.

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:35.520
You know?

01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:41.230
Oh. I forgot. You're an alien.
You don't understand anything.

01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:49.700
<i>We're good to go.</i>

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.800
Hold it.

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:06.550
Your sleeve.

01:18:07.590 --> 01:18:09.550
<i>Oh.</i>

01:18:11.180 --> 01:18:13.100
<i>Let-Let me out!</i>

01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:16.060
- Open the air lock.
- No.

01:18:16.140 --> 01:18:17.440
- <i>Open the door!</i>
- Then we have to flash.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:19.610
- Our protocol--
- I decide what protocol is.

01:18:19.690 --> 01:18:22.400
<i>Open the door! Let me out!</i>

01:18:22.530 --> 01:18:24.240
- <i>Let me out!</i>
- Reset the drill.

01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:25.950
<i>Open it!</i>

01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:28.110
I said, reset the drill.

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:31.830
<i>Let me out! Let me out!
Open the door!</i>

01:18:31.910 --> 01:18:34.080
<i>Let me out!</i>

01:18:41.670 --> 01:18:43.340
Sir, the restraints!

01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:39.770
Open the door!

01:19:39.850 --> 01:19:42.190
Open the door!

01:19:42.270 --> 01:19:45.190
This facility has been sealed.

01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:48.860
No one leaves.

01:20:06.250 --> 01:20:08.840
We've lost contact with the flash chamber, sir.

01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:23.100
Whiskey task force, engage!

01:20:47.090 --> 01:20:49.380
- <i>Were there any survivors?</i>
- No.

01:20:49.460 --> 01:20:52.260
As you know, at 0524 hours,

01:20:52.340 --> 01:20:54.800
our pilots launched a salvo
of Sidewinder air-to-air missiles...

01:20:54.930 --> 01:20:57.100
- into the heart of the mass.
- And?

01:20:57.180 --> 01:20:59.520
Every strike made it larger.

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:02.230
<i>And this mass--
Where is it heading?</i>

01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:04.140
Everywhere.

01:21:53.820 --> 01:21:56.360
Dr. Benson.

01:21:56.450 --> 01:21:59.240
Madam Secretary, please.

01:21:59.330 --> 01:22:03.000
I don't wanna die here in this room
without seeing my son one more time.

01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:06.710
Do you really think you can persuade him?

01:22:06.790 --> 01:22:09.670
I think you should let me try.

01:22:14.130 --> 01:22:17.220
Go on, then.
But I make you no promises.

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:19.550
I still answer to the president.

01:22:19.680 --> 01:22:22.510
- You're on your own.
- No, she's not. I'll go with you.

01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:27.520
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:22:49.670 --> 01:22:51.590
It doesn't work.

01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:01.550
Go ahead.

01:23:08.270 --> 01:23:11.360
It's me. Are you okay?

01:23:12.730 --> 01:23:16.240
I'm fine. He's right here.

01:23:17.820 --> 01:23:19.860
She wants to talk to you.

01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:23.530
Yes.

01:23:23.620 --> 01:23:26.450
I need to get back to the city.

01:23:26.580 --> 01:23:28.790
- Yes.
- Tell her I know where we can meet her.

01:23:43.050 --> 01:23:44.970
I told Helen we should kill you.

01:23:46.850 --> 01:23:48.810
Yes, I heard that.

01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:50.770
I didn't mean it, though.

01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:53.440
- You didn't?
- Well, not anymore.

01:24:00.610 --> 01:24:02.490
So what's gonna happen to us?

01:24:05.830 --> 01:24:08.790
I was just wondering the same thing.

01:24:17.050 --> 01:24:20.220
- End of the world!
- Good luck!

01:24:20.300 --> 01:24:22.220
This is it.

01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:24.430
This is where we're supposed to meet her.

01:24:24.510 --> 01:24:26.510
Come on!

01:24:35.150 --> 01:24:37.150
Hurry up. It's this way.

01:25:09.560 --> 01:25:11.430
You can do this,

01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:14.270
<i>just like with the trooper.</i>

01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:17.860
There are some things I can't do.

01:25:17.940 --> 01:25:20.320
But you have powers.

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:24.570
I'm sorry.

01:25:26.870 --> 01:25:32.410
Please.

01:25:34.250 --> 01:25:38.380
Jacob, nothing ever truly dies.

01:25:38.460 --> 01:25:42.130
The universe wastes nothing.
Everything is simply...

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:44.170
transformed.

01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:48.550
Just leave me alone.

01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:34.600
- It's not fair.
- No.

01:26:34.680 --> 01:26:37.390
No, it isn't fair.

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:41.060
He left me alone.

01:26:41.150 --> 01:26:45.030
Oh, baby. You're not alone.

01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:49.740
And he didn't leave you.
I see him in you...

01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:52.240
all the time.

01:26:52.330 --> 01:26:54.240
All the time.

01:26:54.330 --> 01:26:57.660
Sometimes, it's hard for me to bear.

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:01.130
You miss him too?

01:27:02.130 --> 01:27:04.170
So much.

01:27:06.800 --> 01:27:12.180
I'm sorry.

01:27:12.260 --> 01:27:13.850
Okay.

01:27:42.670 --> 01:27:44.590
<i>It's all right.</i>

01:27:44.670 --> 01:27:46.510
He's here to help.

01:27:50.510 --> 01:27:52.510
There's another side to you.

01:27:56.140 --> 01:27:59.140
I feel it now.

01:28:13.450 --> 01:28:16.200
Is that how it ends?

01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:20.370
Yes.

01:28:20.460 --> 01:28:23.380
You can't stop it?

01:28:24.460 --> 01:28:26.500
I don't know.

01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:34.550
It would come at a price...
to you and your way of life.

01:28:34.640 --> 01:28:36.600
But we can change.

01:28:36.680 --> 01:28:38.600
You know that now.

01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:43.060
Please. Please, just give us a chance.

01:28:45.650 --> 01:28:50.110
I'll try. I must get back to the city.

01:29:08.920 --> 01:29:13.380
<i>Of course, Mr. President,
I understand the situation.</i>

01:29:13.470 --> 01:29:16.850
But with all due respect, sir,
any further military action...

01:29:16.930 --> 01:29:18.850
will only make things worse.

01:29:18.930 --> 01:29:22.270
I believe we may still be able
to open a dialogue--

01:29:28.270 --> 01:29:31.070
Yes, Mr. President. As you wish, sir.

01:29:31.150 --> 01:29:33.280
Thank you.

01:30:00.810 --> 01:30:05.310
- Checkpoint.
- We can't stop. There isn't time.

01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:19.160
Lincoln Bravo One to Lincoln Bravo Two.

01:30:19.240 --> 01:30:22.740
<i>A black S.U.V. crashed our checkpoint with the suspects.
En route to your position.</i>

01:30:22.830 --> 01:30:24.910
<i>Roger that, Bravo One.</i>

01:30:31.340 --> 01:30:34.420
<i>Bravo One, we've got orders to let 'em through.
Do you copy?</i>

01:30:34.510 --> 01:30:35.840
Roger that.

01:30:37.930 --> 01:30:39.800
They're slowing down.

01:30:39.930 --> 01:30:42.350
- They're letting us through.
- <i>Why?</i>

01:30:58.910 --> 01:31:00.660
Where is everybody?

01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:03.370
They've cleared the area.

01:31:04.620 --> 01:31:06.540
- Stop the car.
- What?

01:31:06.620 --> 01:31:08.870
Stop the car!

01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:47.830
<i>Jacob. Jacob!</i>

01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:51.370
- I'm okay.
- Jacob. Michael?

01:31:52.590 --> 01:31:54.590
Michael.

01:32:02.970 --> 01:32:05.100
We have to get to the sphere.

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:18.110
Helen!

01:32:33.580 --> 01:32:35.630
We won't make it!

01:32:50.140 --> 01:32:52.770
I can't keep them out for long.

01:32:59.070 --> 01:33:00.990
Mom.

01:33:08.490 --> 01:33:12.830
What's happening to him?
Jacob.

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:14.540
They're inside him.

01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:18.840
He's dying.

01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:22.470
Help him.

01:33:28.350 --> 01:33:31.600
Help him. Please.

01:34:18.730 --> 01:34:21.400
<i>Your professor was right.</i>

01:34:21.480 --> 01:34:26.240
At the precipice, we change.

01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:44.270
It's leaving.

01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:54.570
No. He's leaving.
