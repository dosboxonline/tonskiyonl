GEORGE JONES:
The universe is not limited

00:06.548 --> 00:09.175
to the three dimensions
that we can see.

00:10.218 --> 00:12.137
What if I were to tell you...

00:13.138 --> 00:15.181
...our universal geometry

00:15.223 --> 00:19.310
may be much larger
than we ever conceived?

00:20.478 --> 00:22.272
BRYAN: Your father was right.

00:22.313 --> 00:24.858
MADDOX:
George Jones is alive.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.276
MI-6 stays out of it.

00:26.317 --> 00:27.902
BRYAN: Do you know what
you're asking me to do?

00:27.944 --> 00:30.572
FINOLA: If we're not willing
to use this technology,

00:30.613 --> 00:32.407
then we're not worthy
to have it.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.367
MADDOX: We're all trying
to assemble these pieces.

00:34.409 --> 00:36.786
They want to call it
an arms race...

00:37.245 --> 00:38.455
...they're right.

00:39.622 --> 00:41.833
(thunder rumbles,
rain pouring)

00:47.130 --> 00:49.674
Buenos días.
Good morning.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.593
Not quite morning yet.

00:56.097 --> 00:58.099
(sighs)

01:01.269 --> 01:04.314
Okay, that's frustrating.

01:04.356 --> 01:06.649
What are you
looking for, Sofia?

01:06.691 --> 01:09.069
Can't find
the seed reorder logs.

01:09.110 --> 01:10.570
I just had them yesterday.

01:10.612 --> 01:12.280
Did you have
any breakfast?

01:12.322 --> 01:14.449
-No.
-Well, that's the problem.

01:14.491 --> 01:17.202
Go make a stack of pancakes,
and you come back in,

01:17.243 --> 01:19.537
you'll find them.

01:19.579 --> 01:20.622
Go on.

01:21.289 --> 01:23.500
Okay, I'm going.

01:25.085 --> 01:27.003
Hey, do you want anything?

01:27.045 --> 01:28.880
-Damn right.
-Okay.

01:30.590 --> 01:32.258
Ooh.

01:35.720 --> 01:38.723
(wind blowing)

01:44.187 --> 01:46.856
(coughing)

01:59.119 --> 02:01.162
(clears throat)

02:04.499 --> 02:08.795
(people coughing
in distance)

02:17.345 --> 02:19.764
(coughing)

02:26.813 --> 02:27.897

02:32.027 --> 02:35.071

(choking, gasping)

03:40.845 --> 03:43.139
(raspy gasp)

03:43.181 --> 03:46.726
**

03:53.858 --> 03:55.860
** (theme)

04:29.894 --> 04:31.813
(sighs loudly)

04:31.855 --> 04:35.942
Wow. Did you lose a bet
or something?

04:35.984 --> 04:39.112
Last pair, or I would've
gotten you some.

04:39.154 --> 04:42.240
You know how long
I've looking for these?

04:42.282 --> 04:43.950
A pair like this?

04:43.992 --> 04:45.493
-Those?
-Yeah.

04:45.535 --> 04:48.121
I mean, they may not
be Ray-Bans, okay?

04:48.163 --> 04:49.456
But The King...

04:49.497 --> 04:50.957
The King didn't
need Ray-Bans.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.501
The King was
as bright as the sun.

04:53.543 --> 04:55.420
Did you get my water?

04:57.881 --> 05:01.634
So you got a slushee,
Vegas glasses, and no water?

05:01.676 --> 05:04.262
I came out to ask
if you wanted

05:04.304 --> 05:06.681
a big one
or a small one.

05:07.140 --> 05:09.309
Right.

05:09.351 --> 05:11.019
Be right back.

05:14.189 --> 05:18.360
The report says the Debris
landed at 2:43 A.M.

05:19.194 --> 05:22.822
Meteorological data says
the rain started around 3 A.M.,

05:22.864 --> 05:26.159
and hasn't stopped.
(mutters)

05:26.201 --> 05:28.995
It seems to be entirely
contained to a half-mile radius.

05:29.037 --> 05:31.539
I've never heard of
anything like this.

05:31.581 --> 05:35.168
No. Wow, they've
classified it at level three.

05:35.210 --> 05:38.338
(thunder rumbles)

05:38.380 --> 05:39.756
Look.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.718
We're here.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.764
**

06:03.071 --> 06:04.614
FINOLA: Agent Reed,
what've you got for us?

06:04.656 --> 06:06.282
REED: Three deaths
that we know of so far.

06:06.324 --> 06:08.410
A farmer and two others who
came from inside the rain zone.

06:08.451 --> 06:11.746
Apparently, they went
to try and help him,
but they died the same way.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.040
So, whatever is happening
in there is poisoning people.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.917
Right. We believe there
are around 30 workers

06:15.959 --> 06:17.794
living in migrant housing
on the farm.

06:17.836 --> 06:19.796
We were in contact with them
for a short time,

06:19.838 --> 06:22.382
but we've lost all radio
and cell signals from inside.

06:22.424 --> 06:23.842
Maybe there all dead.

06:23.883 --> 06:25.427
Do we have
an M.E. here?

06:25.468 --> 06:27.178
-Right over there.
-Okay, thank you.

06:27.220 --> 06:28.263
All right.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.265
(chuckles)
Hey, John.

06:30.306 --> 06:31.891
-Hey, Bryan. Hey.
-Hey.

06:31.933 --> 06:33.893
-It's not an easy one.
-What happened to them?

06:33.935 --> 06:36.813
Preliminary cause of death
appears to be asphyxiation,

06:36.855 --> 06:39.691
like they were reacting to
some type of atmospheric change.

06:40.483 --> 06:42.485
-Atmospheric change?
-Right.

06:42.527 --> 06:45.280
Like somehow
the atmosphere in there
doesn't have enough oxygen.

06:45.321 --> 06:48.324
They managed to stumble out,
but it was too late.

06:48.366 --> 06:49.701
What the hell happened here?

06:49.743 --> 06:51.494
The lining of their lungs
appears to have

06:51.536 --> 06:52.912
suffered chemical damage,

06:52.954 --> 06:54.622
a reaction to
what they were breathing.

06:54.664 --> 06:57.459
So, the Debris
is changing the atmosphere,

06:57.500 --> 06:59.169
changing its composition.

07:00.462 --> 07:01.880
But why isn't
the atmosphere in there

07:01.921 --> 07:03.715
mixing with
the atmosphere out here?

07:05.508 --> 07:06.801
A barrier?

07:06.843 --> 07:08.636
Some sort of
force field, maybe?

07:10.430 --> 07:13.099
One that these three men
were able to walk through?

07:15.143 --> 07:18.480
(thunder rumbles)

07:20.982 --> 07:23.651
**

07:32.035 --> 07:33.828
All right.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.333
Here goes.

07:38.375 --> 07:40.627
FINOLA:
Okay.

07:51.304 --> 07:54.015
(instrument pulsing)

08:02.941 --> 08:06.194
(instrument pulsing)

08:06.861 --> 08:09.030
This place is all bad.

08:11.866 --> 08:14.619
BRYAN:
The light is...

08:14.661 --> 08:16.830
it's different here.

08:18.248 --> 08:19.207
You see the water?

08:19.249 --> 08:20.875
FINOLA: Yeah.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.548
Hey, hang on.

08:30.635 --> 08:31.886
FINOLA: Wow.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.268
Let's check
the buildings.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.649
(people speaking indistinctly)

08:44.691 --> 08:45.859
(gasping)

08:45.900 --> 08:47.485
BRYAN: No, no, no.
(speaks Spanish)

08:47.527 --> 08:49.446
-WOMAN: Who are you?
-BRYAN: We're here to help.

08:49.487 --> 08:51.906
-FINOLA: It's okay. It's okay.
-BRYAN: We're here to help.

08:51.948 --> 08:53.867
There's something wrong
with the rain.

08:53.908 --> 08:55.285
Yeah, we are just trying
to figure this out.

08:55.326 --> 08:57.328
Just trying to work out
what is happening.

08:57.370 --> 08:59.622
Can anybody
tell me what they saw?

08:59.664 --> 09:01.374
We all woke up
early this morning.

09:01.416 --> 09:02.751
It was hard to breathe.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.544
It got worse,

09:04.586 --> 09:07.088
and we felt like
we were going to die.

09:07.130 --> 09:10.467
Like we were poisoned.
But then it stopped.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.135
And-and you're okay now?

09:12.177 --> 09:13.386
We feel okay.

09:13.428 --> 09:15.764
Did you-- Did you see
anyone when you came in?

09:15.805 --> 09:17.182
No. No, why?

09:17.223 --> 09:19.225
My son. My son, Arturo.
He's missing.

09:19.267 --> 09:21.353
He was really scared
when all this started,

09:21.394 --> 09:23.688
and some of us went to look
for him, but I can't find him.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.232
-How old is your son?
-He's eight.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.777
Before the rain,
did you notice anything?

09:28.818 --> 09:30.862
MAN: A few of us
woke up last night.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.573
We heard a rushing,
whistling sound,

09:33.615 --> 09:37.077
-and then a boom.
-Did any of you see
what made the sounds?

09:37.118 --> 09:38.745
Some of the workers
tried to leave,

09:38.787 --> 09:41.081
and they tried the cars,
but they wouldn't start.

09:41.122 --> 09:44.793
They-they left on foot,
but they died, too.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.461
Stay here.

09:46.503 --> 09:48.838
Everybody stay here.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.340
-Okay.
-BRYAN: Okay?

09:54.761 --> 09:56.429
All of the dead bodies
are outside of the zone.

09:56.471 --> 09:58.390
They're all fine in here.
They only die when they leave.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.809
It's like they've all been
changed physiologically.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.144
Like they can't tolerate
normal air anymore.

10:03.186 --> 10:05.772
Come on, let's go back
to base camp.

10:05.814 --> 10:07.273
I'll find out
where they were

10:07.315 --> 10:08.900
and send a team to
recover them for analysis.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.443
-What about the missing boy?
-Yeah,

10:10.485 --> 10:12.362
I'll send a search team
to recover him, too.

10:12.404 --> 10:13.863
I'm gonna sweep
the fields for Debris.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.156
FINOLA:
You go ahead.

It's okay!

11:22.182 --> 11:24.434
You're gonna be okay! Hey!
Calm down.

11:24.476 --> 11:25.977
Papi. Papi.

Está bien.

11:28.063 --> 11:30.398
You're gonna be safe.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.070
You're gonna be safe, okay?

11:46.456 --> 11:48.750
Hey.

11:48.792 --> 11:50.460
It's okay.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.380
Come on.

12:00.512 --> 12:03.932
Arturo! Mi amor!

12:04.974 --> 12:07.227

Thank you.

12:20.448 --> 12:21.950
Right hand.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.953
Oh, my gosh. That was--
That was amazing.

12:24.994 --> 12:27.372
All right, let's switch
to your left hand, Dario.

12:27.414 --> 12:28.998
No, your left.

12:29.791 --> 12:30.834
Left hand.

12:32.002 --> 12:34.504
Bring it up.
A little higher.
There you go.

12:34.546 --> 12:36.965
There you go. Beautiful.
Look at that. Yeah.

12:37.007 --> 12:38.800
Just like a big
catcher's mitt right there.

12:38.842 --> 12:40.593
-(cell phone ringing)
-Come on.

12:40.635 --> 12:42.220
Let's see what you got.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.472
All right.
Left hand.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.933
Ready. Hoo!

12:47.851 --> 12:49.310
You're killing me.

12:49.352 --> 12:51.563
Okay, Dad loses.
I'll give you five more.

12:51.604 --> 12:53.189

12:53.231 --> 12:56.484
Three... four... five.

-Okay. Hold on, buddy.
-(cell phone continues ringing)

12:59.571 --> 13:01.614
I'll be right back.

13:07.871 --> 13:09.581
Hello?

13:10.498 --> 13:12.375
Hello?

13:13.710 --> 13:15.003

13:16.713 --> 13:18.173
WOMAN:
What are you doing?

13:18.214 --> 13:20.258
I-- Someone called.

13:20.300 --> 13:24.179
They hung up when I answered.
It's an unknown caller.

13:25.472 --> 13:28.058
So what?
Do I answer your phone?

13:28.099 --> 13:30.226
No, I don't.
I would never.

13:30.268 --> 13:33.104
MADDOX: I'm sorry,
it just seemed weird.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.648
Not everything
is a conspiracy, Craig.

13:41.905 --> 13:44.324
Okay, buddy. (claps)
Here we go.

13:52.624 --> 13:55.126
Left.
Here we go.

13:56.586 --> 13:57.712
Beautiful.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.005
Is Bryan back yet?

13:59.047 --> 14:00.965
No, but he found the boy.
He's okay.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.258
But there's something else.

14:02.300 --> 14:03.843
There's a man
who just pulled up.

14:03.885 --> 14:05.428
He says he lives here.

14:06.346 --> 14:08.390
-How did he get in?
-He went around the roadblocks.

14:08.431 --> 14:11.184
He says he's not leaving
until he can get to the farm.

14:11.226 --> 14:13.978
-He claims his family's inside.
-(sighs)

14:14.020 --> 14:17.565
FINOLA:
Sorry, you can't be here.
You're gonna have to go back.

14:17.607 --> 14:19.818
No, I live on that farm.
I have family on that farm.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.070
Okay, what's going on there?
Why are you here?

14:22.112 --> 14:23.947
Okay, what's your name?

14:23.988 --> 14:26.241
-Efraim. Efraim Muñoz.
-Efraim...

14:26.282 --> 14:29.119
we can't really say
what's going on at this point,

14:29.160 --> 14:31.204
but it is not safe
for you to go in there.

14:31.246 --> 14:33.832
What are you talking about?
I spoke to them yesterday.
They didn't say anything.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.166
Were you here last night?

14:35.208 --> 14:36.626
No, I was on the road
for a couple of days.

14:36.668 --> 14:39.212
I'm the distribution manager.
What happened?

14:39.254 --> 14:42.382
Well, we are trying to
figure this out, but, please.

14:46.302 --> 14:50.181
These are my brother's
children and his wife Sofia.

14:50.223 --> 14:52.142
I've met them.

14:52.183 --> 14:54.310
They're together,
and they're safe.

14:54.352 --> 14:56.980
-Okay.
-Is your brother
on the farm, too?

14:57.022 --> 14:58.481
He passed away a year ago.

14:58.523 --> 14:59.899
Okay.

14:59.941 --> 15:02.694
Why is that--
Why is that man
wearing a spacesuit?

15:02.736 --> 15:04.279
Efraim, please calm down.

15:04.320 --> 15:05.822
We're going to
keep you onsite

15:05.864 --> 15:07.657
until we have this
under control.

15:07.699 --> 15:08.783
What?

15:08.825 --> 15:10.160
Please.

15:14.998 --> 15:17.125
Toxicology on
the recovered corpse

15:17.167 --> 15:20.420
was severely oxygen-deficient.

15:21.671 --> 15:26.718
Plants from the affected zone
from sample section C

15:26.760 --> 15:30.430
do not appear to engage
in photosynthesis.

15:30.472 --> 15:34.601
However, they do seem to
engage in a similar process

15:34.642 --> 15:38.646
that produces chlorine
instead of oxygen.

15:38.688 --> 15:41.483
Atmospheric composition
in the zone

15:41.524 --> 15:47.113
is almost 45% chlorine,

15:47.155 --> 15:51.284
along with hydrogen,
argon, nitrogen,

15:51.326 --> 15:54.329
but almost zero oxygen,

15:54.371 --> 15:56.706
except in water molecules.

15:56.748 --> 16:00.001
There's a theory that
life forms that engage in

16:00.043 --> 16:02.337
chlorine-based respiration

16:02.379 --> 16:05.632
could exist on other planets.

16:05.674 --> 16:07.175
BRYAN:
Do you want in on this?

16:11.221 --> 16:13.473
You've been
working all night.

16:14.933 --> 16:16.476
Where did you get that?

16:17.352 --> 16:18.937
From the fridge.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.689
Which fridge?

16:20.730 --> 16:22.440
BRYAN:
The fridge in our trailer.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.443
FINOLA:
Then definitely not.

16:25.485 --> 16:27.696
No one's been in that
trailer for three weeks.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.577
I've eaten older.

16:39.249 --> 16:42.627
It's creating a whole
chlorine-based ecology.

16:42.669 --> 16:45.380
Are you suggesting that
the Debris

16:45.422 --> 16:47.215
is terraforming
the planet here?

16:47.257 --> 16:48.883
The Debris changed
the atmosphere,

16:48.925 --> 16:50.593
but something
in the atmosphere

16:50.635 --> 16:53.847
changed the workers into
chlorine-breathing organisms.

16:53.888 --> 16:55.348
Well, that would
explain the episodes

16:55.390 --> 16:56.933
that they all had
earlier in the morning.

16:56.975 --> 17:01.563
If the people in that storm
no longer breathe oxygen...

17:01.604 --> 17:04.607
what happens when
we remove the Debris?

17:05.817 --> 17:09.654
Hey, can we take some more
samples from the dead victims?

17:09.696 --> 17:12.741
I want to bring in a specialist
to analyze them. Thanks.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.456
FINOLA:
What's wrong?

17:19.497 --> 17:21.708
The storm is growing.

17:21.750 --> 17:23.418
How fast?

17:23.460 --> 17:26.463
We should start thinking about
evacuating the county.

17:36.639 --> 17:38.641
They're expecting them.
Tell them to contact me

17:38.683 --> 17:41.019
as soon as they've completed
a full genetic sequencing.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.520
Yes.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.448
Hey.

17:56.201 --> 17:58.161
I want to take
a blood sample from you.

17:58.203 --> 18:02.332
You're the only person we have
with a blood relative in there.

18:02.374 --> 18:03.792
If we could take your blood,

18:03.833 --> 18:06.795
I can compare your DNA
with your nephew's DNA

18:06.836 --> 18:09.130
and it might help us
understand what's going on.

18:09.923 --> 18:12.759
Is it the rain? What--
What is it doing to them?

18:12.801 --> 18:16.388
Please. I just need you
to trust me.

18:19.516 --> 18:21.559
WOMAN:
Make a fist for me.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.568
All done.

18:31.194 --> 18:33.405
FINOLA: Okay.
Do you want some water?

18:41.746 --> 18:44.249
I think I'm being
punished by God.

18:46.167 --> 18:47.460
What do you mean?

18:47.502 --> 18:50.839
I used to...
laugh at my brother

18:50.880 --> 18:53.341
'cause he was
such a family man.

18:54.384 --> 18:56.511
He married young.

18:59.305 --> 19:01.099
I never understood that.

19:01.141 --> 19:03.893
Having a family
made his life...

19:03.935 --> 19:07.188
so much harder
than it would have been
if he didn't have them.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.399
Feeding one mouth
is hard enough.

19:09.441 --> 19:11.484
Feeding four...

19:11.526 --> 19:15.405
When he was dying, he...

19:15.447 --> 19:17.615
he asked
me to take care of them.

19:19.242 --> 19:20.744
What could I say?

19:24.622 --> 19:27.709
After he passed, Arturo,

19:27.751 --> 19:31.296
the way he coped
with it, he...

19:31.338 --> 19:33.590
started calling me "Papi."

19:35.008 --> 19:39.262
I kept having to remind him,
"I'm your uncle.

19:39.304 --> 19:41.306
I'm not your papi."

19:42.474 --> 19:44.392
When I got this job, I...

19:44.434 --> 19:46.227
I was always on the road.

19:46.269 --> 19:48.271
I was making
good money, but...

19:48.313 --> 19:49.981
I started to miss him.

19:51.316 --> 19:55.695
They...
give me this peace.

19:55.737 --> 20:00.784
I realized that my brother
was the smart one.

20:00.825 --> 20:04.037
But there were
a lot of moments

20:04.079 --> 20:07.832
when I wished that I didn't
have this responsibility.

20:07.874 --> 20:09.668
The burden.

20:13.505 --> 20:15.757
And now...

20:17.926 --> 20:19.761
I don't know what's
gonna to happen to them,

20:19.803 --> 20:21.971
if I'm ever gonna
see them again.

20:24.557 --> 20:27.519
Maybe I'm being punished
for the things I thought.

20:27.560 --> 20:31.147
It sounds like
what you did was right.

20:31.189 --> 20:34.192
You acted in
their best interest,

20:34.234 --> 20:39.698
even if it took time
for your heart to catch up.

20:39.739 --> 20:44.494
I can't imagine
a man like that deserves...

20:44.536 --> 20:47.580
punishment.

20:50.000 --> 20:53.586
I'm gonna do my best
to get your family out

20:56.006 --> 20:58.174
BRYAN: Arturo,
this isn't gonna hurt.

20:58.216 --> 21:00.552
(grunts with effort)
Trust me.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.138
(Bryan sighs)

21:05.473 --> 21:06.975
What is that?

21:07.017 --> 21:11.229
This? This is...

21:11.271 --> 21:13.565
the most important part.

21:16.735 --> 21:20.155
These are very
special glasses.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.240
The glasses of a king.

21:22.282 --> 21:26.953
And kings, you know,
they don't get afraid, do they?

21:28.121 --> 21:29.956
Kings rule.

21:34.419 --> 21:35.587
Wow.

21:35.628 --> 21:39.674
And now you rule
this entire farm.

21:44.262 --> 21:45.972
Are you ready, Arturo?

21:46.014 --> 21:47.390
Yeah.

21:47.432 --> 21:50.018
FINOLA:
All right. Super quick.

22:05.075 --> 22:08.745
Ah, they're sending
in the B-team, huh?

22:08.787 --> 22:09.996
They only
send in the A-team

22:10.038 --> 22:12.207
when they want
the agent to survive.

22:13.208 --> 22:14.751
Finola Jones.

22:14.793 --> 22:16.503
It's nice to meet you.

22:16.544 --> 22:19.881
BRYAN: Beck is from
Emergency Containment.
Been briefed?

22:19.923 --> 22:23.343
This is unique.
Picking up 850 in there?

22:23.385 --> 22:25.512
It hasn't moved
since we arrived.

22:26.471 --> 22:28.973
We're lucky it didn't land
in a more populated area.

22:29.015 --> 22:32.352
I've been given orders to
turn this off right away.

22:32.394 --> 22:34.646
It just spread
another 200 feet.

22:34.688 --> 22:36.272
Anything else
I should know?

22:36.314 --> 22:38.400
It's all in the report.

22:38.441 --> 22:41.069
It's got B wavelengths, so...

22:42.445 --> 22:43.613
You comin'?

22:43.655 --> 22:45.156
Yeah, I'll be
right there.

22:48.618 --> 22:52.414
FINOLA: Populated area?
(scoffs)

22:52.455 --> 22:53.957
Even if it's not
a whole city,

22:53.998 --> 22:56.710
there are still people
in jeopardy in there.

22:56.751 --> 22:59.587
They'll die if
the Debris is removed.

22:59.629 --> 23:02.257
Do you even know what
that's gonna look like?

23:03.383 --> 23:06.803
There are things that
you understand about life

23:06.845 --> 23:09.472
that I don't,
and I respect that.

23:09.514 --> 23:11.808
But there are things
that I know

23:11.850 --> 23:14.477
that you will not
find very palatable,

23:14.519 --> 23:15.979
and one of the hard
lessons I have learned

23:16.021 --> 23:17.939
is that when I'm facing
a situation like this,

23:17.981 --> 23:19.482
I want to focus on
the people that we're saving,

23:19.524 --> 23:21.484
not the ones
that we can't.

23:21.526 --> 23:23.236
FINOLA:
I'll find a way.

23:23.278 --> 23:24.821
We don't have time.

23:24.863 --> 23:29.659
Think about the people
in the county. The state.

23:29.701 --> 23:32.162
If we don't act,
we might not be able

23:32.203 --> 23:34.539
to stop the terraforming

23:35.248 --> 23:36.750
(sighs)

23:36.791 --> 23:40.712
There's no way we're gonna
be able to win all these,

23:42.047 --> 23:44.674
And I know that every cell
in your body right now

23:44.716 --> 23:47.552
is screaming for you to do
what you think is right.

23:48.970 --> 23:50.889
I need you
to go against that.

23:50.930 --> 23:53.892
I need you to trust me.

23:57.020 --> 23:59.647
(sighs)

24:00.565 --> 24:03.735
Yeah. Yeah.

24:12.702 --> 24:14.662
but take a look at this.

24:14.704 --> 24:16.247
Okay.
What am I looking at?

24:16.289 --> 24:19.042
WOMAN: Red blood cells
containing a hemoglobin analog,

24:19.084 --> 24:21.878
one that carries chlorine
instead of oxygen.

24:23.129 --> 24:25.548
Their blood and lung tissue
have been invaded

24:25.590 --> 24:26.966
by an alternative
cellular structure,

24:27.008 --> 24:29.844
and it appears progressive.

24:29.886 --> 24:31.805
Like the most
important aspects

24:31.846 --> 24:34.933
of the transformation
happened first.

24:36.559 --> 24:40.188
What we're looking at here
is like nothing on Earth.

24:40.230 --> 24:42.816
The technology to understand,
let alone reverse

24:42.857 --> 24:46.277
what it's done to them
is years away, maybe decades.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.321
(sighs)

24:48.363 --> 24:50.323
I'm sorry.

24:52.325 --> 24:54.285
(instruments trilling)

25:00.250 --> 25:02.460
BECK:
Are you doing all right?

25:02.502 --> 25:04.129
BRYAN: Yeah, I'm fine.

25:06.464 --> 25:09.300
You ever
think of Julian?

25:09.342 --> 25:11.803
How could I forget?

25:12.846 --> 25:14.681
Everything was a lot
simpler back then.

25:15.348 --> 25:17.350
Eh, the agency's
never been simple.

25:17.392 --> 25:21.229
You know what I mean.
Before the Debris.

25:21.271 --> 25:23.523
Why are you
bringing up Jules?

25:23.565 --> 25:26.693
Your partner...
Finola.

25:26.735 --> 25:27.944
Yeah?

25:27.986 --> 25:29.571
You said she's got
a lot of heart.

25:29.612 --> 25:32.449
People used to
say that about Jules.

25:33.783 --> 25:35.368
His heart
got him killed.

25:35.410 --> 25:38.830
Jules went out exactly
the way that he wanted to.

25:39.748 --> 25:41.041
He was a hero.

25:41.082 --> 25:42.542
BECK: Well, that's easy
for you to say.

25:42.584 --> 25:45.211
I'm one that
had to tell his wife.

25:48.882 --> 25:50.633
What's your point?

25:50.675 --> 25:53.136
Just be careful.

25:53.178 --> 25:55.430
Don't let her take you down.

26:05.899 --> 26:07.942
Wait. Wait.

26:07.984 --> 26:10.111
Are you, um... Oh!

26:10.153 --> 26:15.283
Are you familiar with,
uh, Debris piece 489?

26:16.159 --> 26:17.952
I think
you may be reaching.

26:17.994 --> 26:19.996
Oh, I know,
but what else can we do?

26:20.038 --> 26:21.373
There's no other way.

26:21.414 --> 26:23.708
I know they used it
extensively in testing,

26:23.750 --> 26:25.126
but never on a human.

26:25.168 --> 26:26.211
So?

26:26.252 --> 26:27.962
So, there's that
to contend with.

26:28.004 --> 26:29.964
Yes, but I-I know
they were thinking about it.

26:30.006 --> 26:31.758
They were thinking
about using it on, um,

26:31.800 --> 26:33.134
terminal cancer patients.

26:33.176 --> 26:34.886
Thinking about a very
narrow secret study

26:34.928 --> 26:36.721
is different than
acting upon one.

26:36.763 --> 26:42.102
Well, at least these people
would have a chance.

26:44.104 --> 26:45.563
What do you
need me to do?

26:45.605 --> 26:47.482
You know what?
I'll take it from here.

26:47.524 --> 26:49.401
But, April?

26:49.442 --> 26:51.277
Thank you.

26:54.447 --> 26:57.742
BRYAN: Uh, 489.
Which one is that?

26:57.784 --> 27:00.495
FINOLA: It was the piece they
hauled out of the Rockies
a couple months back.

27:00.537 --> 27:02.956
It places organisms
into suspended animation.

27:02.997 --> 27:04.457
The one
O'Neil's team found.

27:04.499 --> 27:06.835
Yes. The researchers
working on it

27:06.876 --> 27:09.295
called the phenomenon
"suspentia."

27:09.337 --> 27:13.675
Bryan, I believe that
we can use Debris 489

27:13.717 --> 27:18.304
to place those people stuck
in that storm into suspentia.

27:18.346 --> 27:22.600
And then we could place them
in a facility until...

27:22.642 --> 27:26.271
uh, until we
figure out a way.

27:26.312 --> 27:29.607
It could
save their lives.

27:29.649 --> 27:32.402
We don't know
that it will.

27:32.444 --> 27:35.613
Yeah--
We just used.
a piece in Iowa

27:35.655 --> 27:37.073
We've done this before.

27:37.115 --> 27:39.075
We know that it works
on cows. Sheep.

27:39.117 --> 27:40.452
Not the same
thing, Finola.

27:40.493 --> 27:42.912
The alternative
to all those people

27:42.954 --> 27:44.914
dying right now

27:44.956 --> 27:48.126
is giving them
some kind of chance.

27:48.168 --> 27:49.753
I understand where
you're coming from, Finola--

27:49.794 --> 27:52.464
No, no, no!

27:53.423 --> 27:56.176
I just see it
differently than you do.

27:56.217 --> 27:59.637
Okay? It doesn't matter
about time, Bryan.

27:59.679 --> 28:02.098
It doesn't matter
if it takes six months,

28:02.140 --> 28:04.476
a year, three years,
however long it takes.

28:04.517 --> 28:07.604
It will give people
like April time.

28:07.645 --> 28:10.231
Time to find something
to neutralize

28:10.273 --> 28:12.150
and reverse the mutation.

28:15.195 --> 28:17.447
You think they're
gonna authorize this?

28:17.489 --> 28:19.616
I've already had it
approved by Maddox,

28:19.657 --> 28:23.244
and it's on its way
from Cheyenne Mountain
Air Force Base.

28:27.624 --> 28:29.542
Well...

28:34.547 --> 28:36.091
Well, that's that.

28:38.134 --> 28:39.636
Where are you going?

28:41.554 --> 28:45.809
I'm going to explain to
Efrain what's going on.

28:45.850 --> 28:47.852
Why?

28:47.894 --> 28:50.605
Why would you do that?

28:50.647 --> 28:52.273
(sighs)

28:55.860 --> 28:58.321
I just think...

29:00.031 --> 29:02.242
we all have the right
to know the truth

29:02.283 --> 29:05.620
about what happens
to the people that we love.

29:07.580 --> 29:09.165
That's not our job.

29:09.833 --> 29:13.628
We are supposed to be blips
in these people's lives.

29:15.005 --> 29:16.381
Not memories.

29:16.423 --> 29:20.385
We're doing
everything we can.

29:28.643 --> 29:31.187
Uh...

29:31.229 --> 29:34.274
We're going to have
to take you into the city.

29:34.315 --> 29:36.651
We've done
all we can for now.

29:36.693 --> 29:39.821
What happened to my family?

29:39.863 --> 29:40.989
Are they dead?

29:41.031 --> 29:42.907
No. No, they're not.

29:42.949 --> 29:45.577
Then just take me
as far as you can.

29:45.618 --> 29:47.203
I see you all go in
with those space suits.

29:47.245 --> 29:49.247
You can give one to me.
I want to see them.

29:49.289 --> 29:50.749
I just want to see them
one more time.

29:50.790 --> 29:52.751
Someone is on their way
to take you somewhere

29:52.792 --> 29:55.253
to be tested to make sure
that you haven't been exposed

29:55.295 --> 29:57.589
to the contaminant
by being here.

29:57.630 --> 30:01.426
Uh, until then, we are
going to have to detain you.

30:01.468 --> 30:03.011
I'm sorry.

30:03.053 --> 30:05.764
But I know I'm okay.
Just like you're okay.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.974
I'm not stupid.
You're lying to me right now.

30:08.016 --> 30:09.893
-Why are you lying to me?
-Guys.

30:10.352 --> 30:12.604
Look, I just want to know
if my family's okay.

30:12.645 --> 30:15.565
I need to see them!
What is wrong with you?!

30:15.607 --> 30:17.776
You promised!
What's happened to them?!

30:17.817 --> 30:19.361
What's happening
to my family?!

30:19.402 --> 30:21.571
No! Just come back! No!

30:21.613 --> 30:22.947
EFRAIN: Please!

30:22.989 --> 30:25.325
**

30:37.420 --> 30:39.714
You're doing the right thing.

31:16.793 --> 31:19.713
(phone vibrates)

31:24.009 --> 31:25.260
Hey, I can't talk right now.

31:25.301 --> 31:26.594
I'm in the middle
of an operation

31:28.263 --> 31:30.890
This is more important.
You need to listen to me.

31:30.932 --> 31:32.726
Are you alone?

31:32.767 --> 31:34.769
Just give me one second.

31:38.773 --> 31:41.735
I've just received
some information...

31:41.776 --> 31:43.319
Okay, what?

31:43.987 --> 31:45.822
It's your father.

31:45.864 --> 31:50.702
We have intelligence reports
that he may still be alive.

31:52.287 --> 31:53.872
What?
What are you talking about?

31:53.913 --> 31:57.375
We have proof that a man
meeting his description

31:57.417 --> 31:59.753
is being held captive
by Influx.

31:59.794 --> 32:02.797
No. Ferris...

32:02.839 --> 32:04.424
Mm-mm.
I saw him dead.

32:04.466 --> 32:06.634
I sat with his body
in the morgue.

32:06.676 --> 32:08.762
-I saw him dead.
-We're still processing

32:08.803 --> 32:12.265
the intel, trying to understand
exactly what's happening.

32:12.307 --> 32:15.435
But there is one thing
we are certain of.

32:15.477 --> 32:18.146
The Americans have known
for some time.

32:18.188 --> 32:21.941
We intercepted
a communication
that Bryan knows, too.

32:21.983 --> 32:23.651
(gasps)

32:25.028 --> 32:27.238
I'm sending you a file.

32:28.656 --> 32:30.283
Okay.

32:30.992 --> 32:32.035
(phone chimes)

32:32.077 --> 32:33.328
(sighs)

32:54.349 --> 32:55.975
Uh, yeah.

32:56.017 --> 32:57.310
These were taken
about three weeks ago

32:57.352 --> 32:58.728
outside London.

32:58.770 --> 33:00.814
I know what
this means to you.

33:00.855 --> 33:04.693
I know how... impactful
his loss has been for you.

33:05.819 --> 33:06.903
But, Finola...

33:06.945 --> 33:08.655
you cannot
betray your knowledge

33:08.697 --> 33:10.198
of this information.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.533
We need to figure out

33:11.574 --> 33:13.743
exactly what
our next steps are.

33:13.785 --> 33:16.579
I'm heading into
a debrief of the situation.

33:16.621 --> 33:19.791
I just...
wanted you to know first.

33:21.042 --> 33:23.878
I'll inform you of
any new developments.

33:23.920 --> 33:25.588
Yeah.

33:32.470 --> 33:35.849
(indistinct chatter)

33:43.398 --> 33:45.525
(thunder rumbles)

34:19.517 --> 34:22.103
I'm going to tell you
something I shouldn't.

34:22.854 --> 34:25.273
Something you are not
going to believe

34:27.359 --> 34:32.280
But every word of it
is true.

34:32.322 --> 34:34.574
**

34:34.616 --> 34:37.577
EFRAIN: Do they know what's
going to happen to them?

34:41.289 --> 34:44.417
EFRAIN: What are they going
to feel when it happens?

34:44.459 --> 34:46.961
FINOLA: I believe
they will feel nothing.

34:48.546 --> 34:52.425
And when they one day wake up,

34:52.467 --> 34:55.261
they won't even know
what happened to them.

34:55.303 --> 34:57.764
They won't age,

34:57.806 --> 35:02.060
they won't experience
the passage of time.

35:03.478 --> 35:06.940
It will be like
hitting pause

35:07.482 --> 35:09.984
on the rest of their lives.

35:10.944 --> 35:12.654
Why are you
telling me all this?

35:12.696 --> 35:15.824
Because I would want to know.

35:17.867 --> 35:21.162
So that I could make
my own decision

35:21.204 --> 35:23.498
with this information.

35:30.505 --> 35:32.340
(handcuffs clink)

35:34.968 --> 35:37.721

35:50.066 --> 35:54.529
(Efrain coughing)

35:58.450 --> 36:01.828
(panting)

36:08.626 --> 36:10.337
Papi? Papi!

36:10.378 --> 36:13.381
Arturo! (laughs)

36:19.054 --> 36:20.347
Why did you come here?

36:20.388 --> 36:21.848
I wanted to be
here with you,

36:21.890 --> 36:23.933
-make sure you're not scared.
-We're not.

36:23.975 --> 36:26.853
The government people
figured out a way to save us.

36:28.063 --> 36:30.398
There's no reason
to be scared now.

36:36.363 --> 36:39.199
Yes, it's true, the, uh...

36:39.240 --> 36:41.117
the agents found a way out.

36:47.332 --> 36:49.250
Everybody, please
take your places.

36:49.292 --> 36:53.421
Okay. Vamos.

37:01.137 --> 37:02.764
SOFIA: Okay.

37:06.184 --> 37:08.061
Okay.

37:08.103 --> 37:10.438
It's gonna be okay.

37:11.773 --> 37:13.608
Are we going to be
okay, Papi?

37:13.650 --> 37:15.110
Hey, I got you.

37:20.699 --> 37:23.034
(instruments trilling)

37:29.791 --> 37:33.378
(switches clicking)

37:33.420 --> 37:36.673
(Debris powering up)

37:40.635 --> 37:42.637
Man (over radio): Four.

37:43.680 --> 37:45.473
Three.

37:46.850 --> 37:48.768
Two.

37:49.936 --> 37:51.146
One.

**

38:16.796 --> 38:18.506
(thunder rumbles)

38:18.548 --> 38:20.717
We're good to go?

38:22.010 --> 38:24.012
All right,
shut it down.

38:48.620 --> 38:51.998
**

39:17.273 --> 39:20.235
**

39:37.293 --> 39:39.129
Did it work?

39:39.170 --> 39:42.090
Readings are showing
they're all alive.

39:51.307 --> 39:54.811
**

41:15.934 --> 41:18.228
-Keep me posted.
-Okay.

41:20.355 --> 41:21.398
(sighs)

41:30.198 --> 41:31.741
Why'd you do it?

41:33.535 --> 41:35.870
I realized it was right.

41:36.538 --> 41:38.289
I just want
to understand it.

41:38.331 --> 41:41.001
I'm not sure you'll
ever understand it.

41:42.293 --> 41:46.631
You have...
a lot of clean up here.

41:46.673 --> 41:49.175
I'm going to have
one of the agents
take me back to the plane

41:49.217 --> 41:51.886
so I can get started
on those reports.

42:01.396 --> 42:04.733

42:33.053 --> 42:34.929
MAN: Roger. We're about
to do the handover.

42:34.971 --> 42:37.307
Can you repeat
last value you had?

42:37.349 --> 42:38.516
(beep)

42:40.560 --> 42:43.438
Unable to confirm with
visual observation.

42:43.480 --> 42:44.439
