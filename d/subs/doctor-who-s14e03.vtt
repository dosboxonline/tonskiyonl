00:47.000 --> 00:48.720
And there were no mines here yesterday.

All right, then.
They must have migrated again.

Fog's bad too.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.160
It's just fog.

Some of the men think
the Kastarions are in the fog.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.240
Like they're made of fog.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.080
That's why we never see them.

02:00.880 --> 02:02.360
I'll let you see my tattoo.

02:02.360 --> 02:03.920
Your tattoo?

02:03.920 --> 02:05.120
It's not on general view,

02:05.120 --> 02:10.200
which makes it more exciting given
the romantic tension between us.

You should be nice to Canto. He likes you.

No, he doesn't.

11:02.360 --> 11:05.640
so that nobody can choke to death
before they are safely shot.

11:05.640 --> 11:08.840
Oh. Okay, I suppose that's--

11:10.720 --> 11:11.720
[gasps]

11:13.160 --> 11:14.200
[Doctor] What's wrong?

11:14.720 --> 11:16.320
Ruby, have you seen something?

11:17.120 --> 11:18.120
[gasps]

11:21.200 --> 11:22.200
Oh.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.280
Oh, Ruby, I'm sorry. I forgot.

11:26.160 --> 11:28.480
- Your first time on a new planet.
- [gasps]

11:29.000 --> 11:30.840
[Doctor] It flips your stomach,
doesn't it?

11:31.640 --> 11:32.760
A brand-new sky.

11:34.360 --> 11:38.640
We're on Kastarion 3,
going by the rings next door.

11:38.640 --> 11:40.480
- Decent enough. Seven out of ten.
- [giggles]

11:40.480 --> 11:43.280
Good trees. Great mountains.
Rainbow crystal.

11:43.280 --> 11:46.280
Ah, wait until you see the dawn.
[chuckles]

11:47.560 --> 11:49.240
Mind you, this place is basically empty.

11:49.240 --> 11:50.680
Who'd pick a fight round here?

11:50.680 --> 11:54.680
Okay, I've got a heavy thing.
I think this is an urn or something.

11:54.680 --> 11:56.600
But it's kind of gross.

11:56.600 --> 11:57.960
- What is it?
- Never mind.

12:00.040 --> 12:02.680
[Ruby] What do you mean, "never mind"?

12:05.000 --> 12:06.680
Tell me what you're not telling me.

12:08.320 --> 12:09.320
Okay.

12:12.600 --> 12:13.840
Okay, that isn't an urn.

12:15.480 --> 12:18.240
There isn't a body inside of that.

12:19.800 --> 12:21.600
That is a body.

12:23.080 --> 12:26.240
That is a dead body.

12:27.080 --> 12:31.200
Compressed somehow.
Like it's been, I don't know, smelted.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.640
[Ruby] Seriously?

12:32.640 --> 12:34.320
I heard a scream. I guess it was that.

12:34.320 --> 12:37.080
He was being smelted?

12:37.080 --> 12:38.600
It's a good word, smelted, isn't it?

12:38.600 --> 12:40.040
Not at the moment.

12:40.040 --> 12:42.120
I never used the word "smelted" before.
It's never come up.

12:42.120 --> 12:43.760
New planet, new word, landmine.

12:43.760 --> 12:45.840
[chuckles] Ooh, I am having a day.

12:45.840 --> 12:47.760
Are you getting scared?
'Cause you're just babbling now.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.040
Toss it in your hand.

12:50.560 --> 12:54.120
That thing,
toss it in your hand and catch it, please.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.080
- Okay, that's about the right weight.
- About?

13:00.080 --> 13:03.520
Okay, it's exactly 6.732217 kilograms.

13:03.520 --> 13:04.880
I was trying not to show off.

13:04.880 --> 13:05.960
Throw it to me.

13:07.600 --> 13:09.560
- No.
- Throw it to my right hand.

13:09.560 --> 13:11.000
I need to use it to counterbalance.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.320
I'm gonna catch it at the exact moment
I put my left foot down on the ground.

13:14.320 --> 13:16.840
I understand, but it's too unstable.

13:18.320 --> 13:20.040
- Let me give it to you.
- No.

13:20.040 --> 13:24.440
You'll have a much better chance
if I just put it in your hand.

13:24.440 --> 13:27.400
If it goes wrong,
you will be caught in the blast.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.400
Well, let's get it right then. [sighs]

13:30.120 --> 13:32.520
Ruby, I forbid this.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.800
Yeah, good luck with that.

13:33.800 --> 13:35.800
You don't understand.
This is a smart-mine.

13:35.800 --> 13:38.840
It is monitoring anything,
any significant change.

13:38.840 --> 13:41.640
I get too worried about you,
and my blood pressure goes up,

13:41.640 --> 13:43.280
and I don't know how much leeway I have.

13:43.280 --> 13:44.680
[Ruby] Best not to worry then.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.640
So how are we gonna do this?
Count of three?

13:52.640 --> 13:54.600
- Please listen to me.
- No arguing, Doctor.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.200
Blood pressure.

13:59.320 --> 14:00.880
[beeping]

14:00.880 --> 14:01.960
[sighs]

14:01.960 --> 14:03.200
Ruby, if this doesn't work...

14:04.240 --> 14:07.120
- [inhales sharply] You are brave.
- [Ruby] Mmm.

14:07.120 --> 14:09.240
- And you are wonderful.
- [chuckles]

14:09.240 --> 14:11.760
And I forgive you
for being incredibly stupid.

14:14.560 --> 14:15.960
[beeping]

14:19.800 --> 14:21.000
Good then.

14:22.760 --> 14:23.840
And if it does work,

14:25.640 --> 14:27.080
I'm gonna be very cross at you

14:27.840 --> 14:30.520
for a very, very long time.

14:31.840 --> 14:34.120
[clicks tongue] Not that long, babes.

14:35.440 --> 14:38.640
- You're standing on a landmine.
- [both laugh]

14:38.640 --> 14:39.720
[Doctor groans]

14:42.320 --> 14:43.320
[breathes shakily]

14:46.240 --> 14:47.960
- Count of three?
- Okay, no, wait.

14:47.960 --> 14:50.720
Um... [stammers]
I n-need something more rhythmic.

14:50.720 --> 14:54.120
Um, I need a beat, like-- like a song.
Sing the song.

14:54.120 --> 14:55.320
- The song? The song.
- The song.

14:55.320 --> 14:57.920
"Over the sea to Skye."
That's the last line. On the word "Skye"--

14:57.920 --> 14:59.680
I love that song.
It's about Bonnie Prince Charlie.

14:59.680 --> 15:03.400
- I know, it's sweet. Let's go.
- It's sweet, and it's sad.

15:03.400 --> 15:06.080
And it's about soldiers fighting.
But it's sad, like a lullaby.

15:06.080 --> 15:07.160
And that's right, isn't it?

15:07.160 --> 15:09.280
Songs about soldiers should be sad,
don't you think?

15:09.280 --> 15:11.200
Okay, Doctor. I'm ready. Stop babbling.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.560
- Okay.
- [sighs]

15:14.080 --> 15:17.640
Okay, Ruby, shall we dance?

15:20.160 --> 15:22.400
[snapping]

15:22.400 --> 15:26.640
<i>♪ Speed, bonny boat
Like a bird on the wing ♪</i>

15:26.640 --> 15:30.080
<i>♪ Onward, the sailors cry ♪</i>

15:30.960 --> 15:34.960
<i>♪ Carry the lad that's born to be king ♪</i>

15:35.600 --> 15:39.080
[together] <i>♪ Over the sea to Skye ♪</i>

15:40.560 --> 15:43.160
- [Ruby chuckles, groans]
- [breathes shakily, groans]

15:43.160 --> 15:44.440
[beeping]

15:44.440 --> 15:47.760
- [sighs, laughs]
- [sighs] Okay, okay.

15:47.760 --> 15:49.080
- Okay.
- [chuckles]

15:49.080 --> 15:51.520
[Doctor sighs, breathes heavily]

15:51.520 --> 15:53.040
Okay, okay. The lights are moving.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.800
That's okay. That's all right. It's fine.

15:54.800 --> 15:57.640
It's the after-effect. It's my adrenaline.
I just need to focus.

15:57.640 --> 15:59.360
- I just need to relax.
- They're still moving.

15:59.360 --> 16:01.240
Maybe don't keep mentioning that.

16:01.240 --> 16:02.320
[pants]

16:02.320 --> 16:04.640
I went down to the beach
and there she stood,

16:04.640 --> 16:06.000
dark and tall, at the edge of the wood.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.120
"The sky's too big. I'm scared," I cried.

16:08.120 --> 16:11.000
She replied, "Young man,
don't you know there's more to life

16:11.000 --> 16:13.400
than the moon and the president's wife?"

16:18.920 --> 16:21.320
[beeping]

16:22.080 --> 16:25.960
Okay. Okay. I think that's it.

16:25.960 --> 16:27.560
[sniffles]

16:27.560 --> 16:28.760
[sighs] That was close.

16:28.760 --> 16:31.840
- [chuckles] No margin for error.
- [exhales]

16:31.840 --> 16:34.840
You know what's really great
about no margin for error?

16:35.720 --> 16:37.560
- No more errors.
- [chuckles]

16:37.560 --> 16:41.040
Thank you, "John Francis Vater".

16:42.120 --> 16:45.040
<i>Hello. I'm John Francis Vater, deceased.</i>

16:45.040 --> 16:46.920
<i>Apologies for your loss.</i>

16:46.920 --> 16:49.280
Oh, voice-activated.

16:49.280 --> 16:50.560
<i>These are my mortal remains.</i>

16:50.560 --> 16:51.640
<i>At your convenience,</i>

16:51.640 --> 16:55.760
<i>please return them to my parents,
Agnes and Millicent Vater.</i>

16:55.760 --> 16:57.920
<i>Address will be supplied on request.</i>

16:57.920 --> 17:00.000
Hey, John. Am I talking to an AI?

17:00.000 --> 17:04.240
<i>I'm an approximate AI reconstruction
of the deceased John Vater.</i>

17:04.240 --> 17:06.520
<i>Signature elements
of my former personality</i>

17:06.520 --> 17:08.920
<i>have been incorporated
into this interface.</i>

17:08.920 --> 17:10.000
<i>Kiss kiss.</i>

17:10.000 --> 17:12.320
[chuckles] What happened to you, John?

17:12.320 --> 17:16.680
<i>I was humanely terminated on the discovery
of the fatal condition, blindness.</i>

17:17.280 --> 17:18.560
Blindness isn't fatal.

17:18.560 --> 17:21.240
You literally just said that
to a dead blind guy.

17:22.440 --> 17:24.080
Who terminated you, John?

17:24.080 --> 17:27.920
<i>I was spared further suffering
by a Villengard Automated Ambulance Unit.</i>

17:27.920 --> 17:32.280
<i>My recovery was estimated
as beyond acceptable parameters</i>

17:32.280 --> 17:33.840
<i>for a conflict as budgeted.</i>

17:34.440 --> 17:37.760
- Sorry. Killed by an ambulance?
- [Doctor] Life is cheap.

17:37.760 --> 17:39.640
Patients are expensive.

17:40.280 --> 17:42.640
- The Villengard algorithm.
- The what?

17:42.640 --> 17:45.160
Villengard battle products
are fitted with AI.

17:45.160 --> 17:46.960
The algorithm maintains a fighting force

17:46.960 --> 17:49.520
at just above the acceptable
number of casualties.

17:49.520 --> 17:52.760
Keeps you fighting,
keeps you dying, keeps you buying.

17:52.760 --> 17:56.320
Medical services optimise
the casualty rate for continued conflict.

17:56.920 --> 18:00.600
War is business, and business is booming.

18:00.600 --> 18:01.680
[gasps]

18:03.200 --> 18:04.280
Good to meet you, John.

18:04.280 --> 18:05.960
- <i>Kiss kiss.</i>
- [Splice] Daddy?

18:05.960 --> 18:06.880
[gasps]

18:08.080 --> 18:10.840
- [explosions in distance]
- Is my daddy there? I heard him.

18:14.280 --> 18:17.000
H-Hello. [chuckles] Hello, up there.

18:17.640 --> 18:20.320
You okay? You need help?

18:21.000 --> 18:22.720
I'm looking for my daddy.

18:23.680 --> 18:26.320
[sighs] How did you--

18:26.920 --> 18:29.880
- Why did you come here?
- [Splice] He sent me a message.

18:29.880 --> 18:32.000
I can read a geo-stamp.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.240
Where is he? Where's my daddy?
I heard him.

18:35.120 --> 18:36.840
Shouldn't you be tucked up in bed?

18:37.680 --> 18:40.760
What's a little kid like you
doing out in a nasty war like this?

18:40.760 --> 18:42.880
My dad got special permission to bring me.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.480
Oh, that's good, isn't it? [chuckles]

18:48.480 --> 18:50.000
'Cause my mummy got gathered up.

18:53.320 --> 18:56.000
She got what? G-Gathered?

18:56.000 --> 18:57.520
She got gathered up by God.

18:57.520 --> 18:59.480
He loved her so much
that he gathered her up early

18:59.480 --> 19:01.560
so she can be in heaven with him
like an angel.

19:03.880 --> 19:06.240
We'll see her again one day,
Daddy explained.

19:07.960 --> 19:09.600
Where is Daddy?

19:14.440 --> 19:16.440
Uh, this is Ruby.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.440
- And my name is the Doctor.
- [chuckles]

19:19.040 --> 19:20.640
- The Doctor isn't a name.
- [Doctor] Yeah.

19:20.640 --> 19:22.720
[laughs] And I'm not even a doctor.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.480
[laughs]
People don't usually bring that up.

19:24.480 --> 19:26.040
You're good already.

19:26.040 --> 19:29.200
- I'm Splice.
- Great name. I love it!

19:29.200 --> 19:31.480
- Just Splice or--
- Splice Alison Vater.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.160
<i>Splice Alison Vater,
you have been identified</i>

19:36.160 --> 19:38.800
- <i>as the next of kin of John Francis Vater.</i>
- Daddy!

19:38.800 --> 19:41.440
<i>I am an AI reconstruction
of your deceased parent.</i>

19:41.440 --> 19:43.360
- <i>Apologies for your loss.</i>
- [Ruby] No.

19:43.360 --> 19:44.880
- <i>Let's grieve together. Come to--</i>
- No. Wait!

19:44.880 --> 19:46.360
- Dad!
- [Ruby] Wait!

19:46.360 --> 19:47.840
- [grunts]
- [Splice] Daddy!

19:47.840 --> 19:49.800
Let go of me! Get off me!

19:49.800 --> 19:51.920
No, no! Please, Splice.

19:51.920 --> 19:53.880
- <i>If I'm causing distress...</i>
- [Doctor] Ruby.

19:53.880 --> 19:56.240
- [Ruby] Please! No.
- <i>...perhaps I should come back later.</i>

19:56.240 --> 19:57.800
- [grunting]
- <i>Kiss kiss.</i>

19:57.800 --> 19:58.800
Dad!

19:58.800 --> 20:00.200
[Ruby grunts]

20:00.200 --> 20:01.320
- [Splice] Let go of me!
- Ruby.

20:01.320 --> 20:03.240
- [grunts]
- Look at his foot!

20:03.240 --> 20:05.920
- Look at what he's standing on.
- [Doctor panting]

20:07.280 --> 20:10.280
You see that? [grunts]
See what he's standing on?

20:10.280 --> 20:11.800
- [panting]
- [beeping]

20:12.960 --> 20:14.920
- [Ruby] Okay?
- [breathing heavily]

20:14.920 --> 20:16.920
Doctor, you okay?

20:16.920 --> 20:19.560
It's just an adrenaline rush.
Just gotta control it.

20:20.840 --> 20:23.240
[sighs] It's going down.
Down, let's move it down.

20:23.240 --> 20:25.320
Down, down, down, down, down.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.720
Slide it down.

20:26.720 --> 20:28.000
[exhales]

20:28.920 --> 20:31.880
Doctor. What's happening?

20:33.680 --> 20:36.240
[breathing heavily] Me.

20:38.120 --> 20:39.520
I'm happening.

20:42.680 --> 20:44.320
[gasps] I'm the explosive.

20:49.480 --> 20:51.200
- [thud]
- [Mundy] You are in my sights!

20:52.160 --> 20:54.800
- I can drop you where you stand.
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

20:54.800 --> 20:56.200
[Mundy] Do you understand?

20:57.600 --> 20:59.480
Signal your understanding.

21:01.680 --> 21:03.480
- Signal your understanding!
- I understand!

21:03.480 --> 21:06.360
Please! I understand.

21:06.360 --> 21:08.280
He's on a landmine.
He's standing right on one.

21:08.280 --> 21:11.000
Ma'am, I'm fully apprised
of what he's standing on.

21:12.680 --> 21:14.680
- Splice, you okay down there?
- I'm here, Mundy.

21:14.680 --> 21:16.080
I'm trying to find Daddy.

21:16.080 --> 21:19.080
I saw him. He was a hologram. Where is he?

21:32.480 --> 21:35.520
Sir, my name is Mundy Flynn.

21:36.120 --> 21:38.360
I'm an ordained Anglican Marine.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.240
What are you doing out here?

21:41.760 --> 21:42.800
Are you

21:43.960 --> 21:44.960
civilians?

21:44.960 --> 21:47.280
- Anglican what?
- Great name, Mundy Flynn.

21:47.280 --> 21:49.680
You should marry Ruby.
Then you'll be Mundy Sunday.

21:49.680 --> 21:52.080
Go on, get married. I'd laugh every day.

21:52.080 --> 21:55.800
What's an Anglican Marine?
Since when was the Church an army?

21:55.800 --> 21:58.120
Since most of your history.
You've been living in a blip.

21:58.120 --> 22:00.360
Sir, the casket in your right hand.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.960
Are you aware those are the sacred remains

22:03.960 --> 22:05.800
- of an ordained Anglican?
- [comm chimes]

22:05.800 --> 22:07.560
Are you aware your face is ringing?

22:09.480 --> 22:11.000
[Splice grunting]

22:11.000 --> 22:12.080
[comm beeps]

22:12.080 --> 22:13.240
Did you like the tattoo?

22:13.240 --> 22:14.520
What? I geo-stamped you.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.640
I know where you are.
Get back to the compound.

22:16.640 --> 22:19.440
- You're giving me orders now?
- What? I'm not giving you orders.

22:19.440 --> 22:21.320
I'm worried. Fog drones have been out.

22:21.320 --> 22:23.040
The Kastarions could
be planning an attack.

22:23.040 --> 22:26.200
[scoffs] Shut up, you're worried.
You don't even like me.

22:26.200 --> 22:27.880
- Of course I--
- [comm beeps]

22:29.640 --> 22:33.080
Okay, this idiot little war.
Who are you fighting?

22:33.880 --> 22:35.040
The Kastarions.

22:36.600 --> 22:38.600
Yeah? The Kastarions?

22:40.320 --> 22:43.040
[chuckles] Go on.
Tell me about the Kastarions.

22:47.440 --> 22:49.040
- We've never seen them.
- Excuse me?

22:49.040 --> 22:50.520
[Mundy] They're in the mud.

22:52.440 --> 22:54.320
Well, that's what we think.

22:54.320 --> 22:55.440
Some of us.

22:57.200 --> 22:59.120
- Or the fog.
- What, sentient mud?

22:59.120 --> 23:01.080
- Sir, I do not have time for this.
- Seriously?

23:01.080 --> 23:03.120
Do you know how ridiculous you sound?

23:04.680 --> 23:07.160
I've met sentient mud. Lovely girls.

23:07.160 --> 23:10.320
Grumpy, yeah, but you try laying around
with your face full of mammals all day.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.320
- Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you...
- [gun whirs]

23:12.320 --> 23:14.280
...to let go of that casket.

23:17.200 --> 23:18.320
- Just let it fall.
- [Ruby] No!

23:18.320 --> 23:20.400
If he drops the casket,
it'll trigger the landmine.

23:20.400 --> 23:22.640
- It'll kill him!
- He's dead already.

23:22.640 --> 23:25.960
Sir, when you stepped on that mine,
you triggered a countdown.

23:25.960 --> 23:28.520
It's now trying to assess
whether it's acquired a viable target.

23:28.520 --> 23:32.080
If it can't within a specified time,
it fails safe.

23:33.080 --> 23:34.200
It blows anyway.

23:34.200 --> 23:35.680
[breathing heavily]

23:44.000 --> 23:45.880
Drop the casket.

23:45.880 --> 23:47.680
Immolation. How does it work?

23:48.320 --> 23:50.120
There's no explosive
in this landmine, right?

23:50.120 --> 23:54.240
Immolation triggers a quantum-level
chain reaction in the subject's DNA.

23:54.240 --> 23:56.080
You are the explosive.

23:56.080 --> 23:57.280
I'm a Time Lord.

23:57.280 --> 23:59.680
- Not a human, I'm a Time Lord--
- [fires]

23:59.680 --> 24:01.640
- [strains, pants]
- [Ruby] Doctor!

24:04.160 --> 24:05.800
[breathes heavily]

24:05.800 --> 24:08.080
I am a higher-dimension life form.

24:08.080 --> 24:10.880
I am a complex space-time event.

24:11.520 --> 24:13.280
I'm Anglican.

24:13.280 --> 24:14.320
- [fires]
- [strains]

24:14.320 --> 24:16.320
No, no! Stop it!

24:16.960 --> 24:18.600
[machine whirring]

24:20.160 --> 24:21.440
[Doctor breathing heavily]

24:21.440 --> 24:24.240
I'm a much bigger bang
than you bargained for.

24:24.840 --> 24:26.440
I'm a lot more explosive than I look,

24:26.440 --> 24:27.560
and, honey,

24:28.600 --> 24:29.840
I know how I look.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.320
Put a quantum chain reaction through me,

24:32.320 --> 24:35.360
and I will shatter this silly
little battlefield of yours into dust.

24:35.360 --> 24:36.880
[beeping]

24:36.880 --> 24:38.280
All of it.

24:38.280 --> 24:40.600
In a heartbeat, into dust.

24:42.760 --> 24:44.320
- That's not possible.
- Everything is possible.

24:44.320 --> 24:48.480
Everything is possible.
Everywhere is a beach eventually.

24:50.080 --> 24:51.200
Scan me.

24:53.480 --> 24:55.160
Scan me. See for yourself.

24:55.160 --> 24:56.960
[gun powers down]

24:58.440 --> 25:00.920
[scanner warbles, beeping]

25:03.880 --> 25:06.920
You could blow up half of this planet.

25:08.080 --> 25:12.080
- [alert beeping]
- <i>Combat detected. Combat detected.</i>

25:12.680 --> 25:14.440
- [Doctor] Shoot it!
- <i>Combat detected.</i>

25:14.440 --> 25:16.080
[Mundy] The algorithm won't let me!

25:16.080 --> 25:17.560
- What is that thing?
- <i>Combat detected.</i>

25:17.560 --> 25:20.840
- Is it a robot? Doctor, what is that?
- [Mundy] It's an ambulance.

25:20.840 --> 25:22.160
- <i>Combat detected.</i>
- [Ruby] It's a what?

25:22.160 --> 25:24.360
- [stammers] How is that an ambulance?
- Stop it.

25:24.360 --> 25:26.560
- <i>Patient acquired.</i>
- Please, stop it.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.600
- <i>Patient acquired.</i>
- You've got to stop that thing.

25:28.600 --> 25:31.800
<i>Patient acquired. Hold still.</i>

25:31.800 --> 25:34.160
- Daddy!
- <i>Hello, Daughter Splice,</i>

25:34.160 --> 25:35.960
<i>can I assist you
with any persistent regrets?</i>

25:35.960 --> 25:37.680
- [battle nurse] <i>Sharp scratch.</i>
- Daddy!

25:37.680 --> 25:39.560
- [groans, winces]
- [gasps]

25:39.560 --> 25:43.120
<i>Would you like to look at some old
photographs to remember the good times?</i>

25:43.800 --> 25:47.120
<i>Patient name.
Patient name unknown. Unidentified.</i>

25:47.120 --> 25:50.680
- [exhales heavily]
- <i>Vital signs. Vital signs. Vi-Vital signs.</i>

25:50.680 --> 25:52.240
- [gasping]
- No, he's not human!

25:52.240 --> 25:54.160
[breathes deeply] Get it off me!

25:54.160 --> 25:55.520
- [yelps]
- <i>Vi-Vital signs.</i>

25:55.520 --> 25:56.960
- [groans]
- Combat!

25:56.960 --> 25:58.720
"Combat is detected."
That's what she said!

25:58.720 --> 26:00.600
- Give me the gun.
- What are you doing?

26:00.600 --> 26:03.200
Combat! Can't you hear that lovely combat?

26:03.200 --> 26:05.400
- [gasps]
- [Ruby] Combat, right this way! Combat!

26:05.400 --> 26:07.360
- Combat! Combat!
- [Mundy] Stay right here, okay?

26:07.360 --> 26:09.280
Look! That's when we saw the antelope!

26:11.800 --> 26:14.560
<i>Combat detected. Combat detected.</i>

26:14.560 --> 26:16.840
<i>Combat detected.</i>

26:16.840 --> 26:18.320
Wait!

26:21.080 --> 26:24.160
Shoot me. It needs to detect an injury,
or it won't triage.

26:24.160 --> 26:25.120
- Shoot me.
- No, I can't!

26:25.120 --> 26:26.520
It's fine. I put it on setting one.

26:26.520 --> 26:28.320
- Just do my arm or something.
- I can't.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.280
You really have to. Come on!
You can do it!

26:30.280 --> 26:31.760
Shoot me a little bit. Just do my arm.

26:31.760 --> 26:32.720
[pants]

26:32.720 --> 26:35.040
- Left one, please.
- Yeah, sorry.

26:37.160 --> 26:38.920
[laser fire]

26:50.320 --> 26:51.320
[gasps]

26:52.640 --> 26:53.640
[shouts]

26:55.360 --> 26:58.680
Oh, my God! Oh, my God.
[pants] Are you okay?

26:58.680 --> 27:00.320
[battle nurse] <i>Patient acquired.</i>

27:00.320 --> 27:02.360
- <i>Patient acquired.</i>
- Ruby. Ruby, can you hear me?

27:02.360 --> 27:05.120
- [panting] Doctor, what's happening?
- [battle nurse] <i>Sharp scratch.</i>

27:08.520 --> 27:10.320
She was gonna shoot you. I saw her.

27:10.320 --> 27:12.480

- Who-- Who is my next of kin?

27:30.240 --> 27:31.320
[Ruby crying]

27:31.320 --> 27:37.200
<i>Next of kin. Next of kin. Next of kin.
Next of kin. Next of kin.</i>

<i>Next of kin. Next of kin.</i>

27:42.680 --> 27:45.200
- <i>Next of kin.</i>
- That's not possible.

27:45.200 --> 27:47.680
- <i>Next of kin.</i>
- It doesn't snow here. It never snows.

27:48.720 --> 27:51.720
No, it's Ruby. This has happened before.

27:51.720 --> 27:52.960
<i>Next of-- Next of kin.</i>

27:52.960 --> 27:54.400
Just please tell me who it is.

27:54.400 --> 27:56.200
It's good, it's good. The snow is good.

27:56.200 --> 27:58.240
While there's snow, there's ho--

27:58.240 --> 27:59.320
[rumbling]

28:03.480 --> 28:05.480
[Canto] It stopped. How can it do that?

28:05.480 --> 28:06.560
How can it just stop?

28:06.560 --> 28:13.320
[battle nurse] <i>Vital signs failing.
Mortality estimate: 432 seconds.</i>

28:13.320 --> 28:14.520

<i>Patient non-ordained.</i>

28:17.920 --> 28:20.080
- <i>Treatment withheld.</i>
- [Doctor panting]

28:29.040 --> 28:30.600
She was gonna shoot you.
I don't understand.

28:30.600 --> 28:33.800
It doesn't matter. Look at the readings.
If that mine blows, it blows everything.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.400
[Doctor] <i>I went down to the beach,
there she stood,</i>

28:35.400 --> 28:36.720
<i>dark and tall, edge of the wood.</i>

28:36.720 --> 28:37.960
<i>"The sky's too big. I'm scared," I cried.</i>

28:37.960 --> 28:40.600
<i>She replied, "Young man,

28:40.600 --> 28:43.040

- [Mundy] Sir.

28:43.880 --> 28:45.280
Sir, please.

28:47.200 --> 28:50.560
I've scanned the device.
I've ran the numbers. You're right.

28:51.960 --> 28:54.440
You're gonna blow
a really big hole in everything.

28:54.440 --> 28:57.120
You could wipe out every Anglican here.

28:58.040 --> 29:01.360
Please, what do we do?

29:03.240 --> 29:04.240
Ruby.

29:05.360 --> 29:07.120
[Mundy] We're doing everything we can.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.080
[Canto] I'm reconfiguring
the ambulance protocols.

29:11.000 --> 29:12.400
It could revive her,

29:12.400 --> 29:14.560
but it's not programmed
to assist non-believers.

29:16.560 --> 29:19.320
[Mundy] Sir, the mine is cycling down
to the end of the countdown.

29:19.320 --> 29:21.960
We've got five minutes.
Probably less. Please.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.480
What can we do?

29:26.960 --> 29:27.960
Surrender.

29:31.680 --> 29:33.520
- Excuse me?
- Surrender.

29:34.720 --> 29:35.880
Lose.

29:36.800 --> 29:37.920
Give in.

29:40.560 --> 29:42.320
[Mundy] Even if that were possible,
which it isn't,

29:42.320 --> 29:45.520
even if I had the divinity to authorise
that, it wouldn't switch off the landmine.

29:45.520 --> 29:46.760
Yes, it would.

29:49.960 --> 29:50.960
Why?

29:52.240 --> 29:54.720
Because it's your landmine.

29:56.440 --> 29:57.360
[alert chimes]

29:57.360 --> 30:00.000
[battle nurse] <i>Patient death imminent.
Thoughts and prayers.</i>

30:00.000 --> 30:01.520
No. No, no, no, no, no.

30:01.520 --> 30:04.360
Ruby, stop that. Hang on in there.
I still need you.

30:05.440 --> 30:08.440
I can't think unless I'm talking,
and I can only talk to you.

30:08.440 --> 30:11.200
Mundy thinks that she's fighting
the Kastarions. What do you think?

30:11.880 --> 30:13.680
You figured it out yet?

30:13.680 --> 30:16.320
[chuckles]
I don't think Mundy's figured it out.

30:16.320 --> 30:17.240
Figured what out?

30:17.240 --> 30:20.040
So this lot, Ruby, they came here,
what, six months ago?

30:20.040 --> 30:23.240
They set up their defences and
fired their warning shots into the air.

30:23.240 --> 30:25.320
"Watch out. We come in peace."

30:25.320 --> 30:26.240
Yeah?

30:27.120 --> 30:29.680
We advertised our presence.
It's standard procedure.

30:29.680 --> 30:31.480
[laughs]

30:32.200 --> 30:36.280
Do you hear that, Ruby?
They advertised their presence.

30:36.280 --> 30:38.000
And do you know what that does?

30:38.000 --> 30:40.160
Ruby, that-that activates
the Villengard algorithm.

30:40.160 --> 30:42.400
The acceptable casualty rate algorithm.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.880
Keeps you dying, keeps you buying. Huh?

30:45.640 --> 30:50.760
Do you get it? Huh, do you get it?
Do you get-- Do you get it? [pants]

30:53.840 --> 30:55.080
Do you get it?

30:57.360 --> 30:59.040
Do you get-get-get it?

31:00.960 --> 31:02.640
There's nobody else here.

31:04.760 --> 31:06.640
You declared war on an empty planet.

31:07.640 --> 31:10.320
There are no Kastarions in the mud.
They're not in the fog.

31:10.320 --> 31:13.400
There are no Kastarions.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.440
Just the algorithm

31:15.440 --> 31:19.760
maintaining an acceptable casualty rate
in the face of nothing at all.

31:20.400 --> 31:22.440
You are fighting your own hardware.

31:22.440 --> 31:26.400
And it is killing you at just
the right amount to keep you buying more.

31:27.120 --> 31:30.360
I mean, most armies would notice
that they were fighting smoke and shadows,

31:30.360 --> 31:31.920
but not this lot, Ruby.

31:31.920 --> 31:33.480
You know why? 'Cause they have faith.

31:33.480 --> 31:34.640
- Shut up!
- Faith!

31:36.120 --> 31:39.200
The magic word that keeps you
never having to think for yourself.

31:42.240 --> 31:43.960
Just surrender, Mundy.

31:43.960 --> 31:45.320
Just stop...

31:47.920 --> 31:49.160
and it's all over.

31:52.600 --> 31:53.640
Prove it.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.720
What, seriously?

31:58.640 --> 32:02.200
Now you need proof, faith girl?

32:04.200 --> 32:06.040
[Mundy]
Only the bishop can declare a surrender,

32:06.040 --> 32:07.920
and the bishop will need proof.

32:07.920 --> 32:12.640
- Oh. John Francis Vater, father and AI.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

32:12.640 --> 32:15.360
I need you to download yourself
into the Villengard battle computer

32:15.360 --> 32:17.240
and find proof
that the planet is uninhabited

32:17.240 --> 32:19.080
and that the casualty rate
is hardware driven.

32:19.080 --> 32:22.240
Send it to the scanner
in Mundy Flynn's hand.

32:22.240 --> 32:25.400
<i>Apologies. That is not possible.
I am not connected to the network.</i>

32:25.400 --> 32:28.520
No, but the ambulance is.
And the ambulance is connected to me.

32:28.520 --> 32:29.920
And I am connected to you.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.200
Shut up and google.

32:31.200 --> 32:33.720
<i>That is against my digital protocol, sir.</i>

32:35.200 --> 32:36.240
Listen to me.

32:36.240 --> 32:39.400
However little is left of you,
you are still a father.

32:41.760 --> 32:45.360
Dad to dad,
you never let them down, right?

32:47.520 --> 32:49.040
Ever.

32:49.040 --> 32:50.640
To the end, right?

32:53.360 --> 32:57.080
Dad to dad, dust to dust. Am I right?

32:57.080 --> 33:00.080
Sir, he can't. He's just an AI simulant.

33:07.480 --> 33:09.520
<i>I'll be back. Do your teeth.</i>

33:17.800 --> 33:19.920
How much of the countdown left?

33:21.640 --> 33:23.320
Three minutes maybe.

33:25.120 --> 33:26.760
Thoughts and prayers.

33:31.920 --> 33:33.800
[Canto, quietly] That will do that.

33:33.800 --> 33:36.040
- How's it going?
- There are safeguards. Hush.

33:36.040 --> 33:37.560
[device beeping]

33:40.320 --> 33:41.320
I saw your tattoo.

33:43.080 --> 33:46.280
- What?
- The-- The one you did on Posh Graham.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.840
It was beautiful.

33:49.680 --> 33:52.720
- You checked out my tattoo on Posh Graham?
- Of course.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.680
- Why?
- I wanted to see it.

33:58.200 --> 33:59.440
But why?

34:01.560 --> 34:03.520
Why did you even come out here?

34:04.120 --> 34:05.680
Why were you looking for me?

34:07.640 --> 34:08.640
Canto.

34:10.720 --> 34:11.720
Do you like me?

34:11.720 --> 34:13.600
Of course, I like you.

34:13.600 --> 34:15.400
Everyone knows that I like you.

34:15.400 --> 34:17.840
Except Posh Graham,
who now thinks I like him.

34:17.840 --> 34:19.680
It was on his upper thigh.
You could've warned me.

34:19.680 --> 34:21.280
[chuckles]

34:24.720 --> 34:25.760
Hang on.

34:27.800 --> 34:29.000
Does that mean you like me?

34:33.680 --> 34:35.800
<i>Defences. Defences.</i>

34:35.800 --> 34:37.520
What is it? What is happening?

34:37.520 --> 34:40.880
[coughs] Canto, talk to me.
Are you all right?

34:41.680 --> 34:43.480
[Canto] <i>I'm fine. How are you?</i>

34:44.080 --> 34:46.640
Where are you? I can't-- Are you injured?

34:46.640 --> 34:48.960
- [Canto] <i>I'm fine. How are you?</i>
- [Mundy] I'm okay.

34:48.960 --> 34:51.720
Just shock.

35:02.000 --> 35:03.320
Canto.

35:03.320 --> 35:06.680
[sighs] Canto.

35:06.680 --> 35:09.080
[Canto] <i>You are identified as Mundy Flynn,</i>

35:09.080 --> 35:10.680

35:10.680 --> 35:13.920
<i>Here's a personal message
recorded just for you.</i>

35:15.920 --> 35:17.640
<i>If anything happens to me,</i>

35:19.120 --> 35:20.600
<i>I want you to know that</i>

35:22.200 --> 35:23.240
<i>I love you.</i>

35:25.080 --> 35:28.840
<i>And honestly, it's okay that...</i> [sighs]

35:28.840 --> 35:30.120
<i>...you don't love me back.</i>

35:39.680 --> 35:40.760
[cries]

35:43.120 --> 35:46.000
<i>Sorry. Yeah.</i>

36:03.320 --> 36:05.360
[Doctor] I'm sorry about your friend.

36:07.160 --> 36:09.200
[sniffles] It was my fault.

36:09.840 --> 36:11.520
I distracted him.

36:18.520 --> 36:20.240
[Doctor] It was nothing to do with you.

36:20.240 --> 36:21.600
It was the algorithm breach.

36:21.600 --> 36:24.560
The Villengard algorithm
is protecting itself.

36:24.560 --> 36:26.760
The ambulance killed him.

36:26.760 --> 36:29.600
[ambulances] <i>Thoughts and prayers.

36:29.600 --> 36:32.080
[repeating] <i>Thoughts and prayers.</i>

36:32.080 --> 36:35.960
We sent Daddy in there,
and it's fighting back. Look.

36:38.720 --> 36:40.560
Of course. Of course, there's security.

36:40.560 --> 36:42.840
There's a firewall.
Why didn't I think of that?

36:42.840 --> 36:44.000
What's happening?

36:44.000 --> 36:46.280
The algorithm will do anything it can
to protect itself.

36:46.280 --> 36:48.280
- Anything at all.
- [John] <i>Antelope.</i>

36:48.280 --> 36:49.880

- John.

36:49.880 --> 36:52.880
<i>Antelope. I saw antelope. We saw antelope.</i>

36:52.880 --> 36:56.920
We saw the antelope together.
I-I remember! I remember, Daddy!

36:56.920 --> 36:59.880
<i>Antelope. We saw antelope.
Antelope. Sorry.</i>

36:59.880 --> 37:02.920
Tell her to run, John!
Tell your daughter to run now!

37:02.920 --> 37:04.920

39:13.520 --> 39:17.640
The whole Villengard arms industry,
all of it,

39:17.640 --> 39:21.920
just got beaten up
by this little kid's dad!

39:21.920 --> 39:24.920
- Doctor.
- Ah! Ruby! Ruby!

39:25.480 --> 39:28.440
Ah, why are you lying around
missing all the good stuff?

39:28.440 --> 39:31.400
A war just got switched off and very
possibly sent to bed without its supper.

39:31.400 --> 39:34.040
I don't-- What happened?

39:34.040 --> 39:36.600
Well, it's, uh--
It's kind of hard to sum up.

39:36.600 --> 39:39.200
I think if I had a diary, it would be
a little bit too exciting for words.

39:39.200 --> 39:40.520
I think I could write it with drums.

39:40.520 --> 39:42.840
Can you write a diary in drums?
I bet I could.

39:42.840 --> 39:46.880
- Uh, wait-- [chuckles]
- [chuckles, imitating drums]

39:50.000 --> 39:51.280
October the 5th!

39:51.280 --> 39:54.840
I sent this girl's dad into the software
just for a look around.

39:54.840 --> 39:58.360
Just looking for proof,
and he must have been very cross.

39:58.360 --> 40:00.840
Because now,
the whole Villengard mainframe

40:00.840 --> 40:04.000
has been taken down by parent power.

[inhales deeply]

40:34.480 --> 40:36.440
Right, enough of that.
Moving on. Come on, Ruby.

40:36.440 --> 40:38.800
No. Hang on. We've had, like,
two minutes of the awesome.

40:38.800 --> 40:42.480
Yeah, two minutes. No lingering.
Plenty more universe to see.

40:42.480 --> 40:45.040
And quite frankly, your lifespan sucks.

40:46.440 --> 40:47.800
All right. Come here, Splice.

40:50.640 --> 40:52.680
Splice, I'm so sorry about your dad.

40:53.680 --> 40:54.920
Why are you sorry?

40:54.920 --> 40:56.720
Because he's gone now.

40:57.600 --> 41:00.440
But I know that Mundy is gonna
take really good care of you.

41:01.720 --> 41:04.000
Silly, he's not gone.

41:05.040 --> 41:07.240
He's just dead.

41:07.240 --> 41:08.440
He's not gone.

41:10.760 --> 41:15.320
[chuckles] That is right.
That is exactly right.

41:16.080 --> 41:17.760
You keep the faith, Splice.

41:19.640 --> 41:21.920
I thought you didn't
like faith much, Doctor.

41:24.520 --> 41:29.000
Just because I don't like it,
doesn't mean I don't need it, Mundy.

41:30.280 --> 41:31.560
[chuckles]

41:37.440 --> 41:38.560
Goodbye.

41:38.560 --> 41:40.040
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

41:40.040 --> 41:43.200
I will be popping in every now and then.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.760
Fish fingers and custard is my favourite.

41:45.760 --> 41:47.280

- Okay, come on, Ruby.

41:47.280 --> 41:49.360
Yes, yes.
Sorry we gotta rush off like this.

41:49.360 --> 41:53.040
But he probably needs changing. Bye!

41:55.800 --> 41:56.920
[sighs]

41:58.320 --> 42:00.120
- Do you think she'll be all right?
- [sighs]

42:00.120 --> 42:01.520
Splice?

42:01.520 --> 42:05.320
[scoffs] I reckon future president
of something.

42:05.320 --> 42:07.320
[chuckles]

42:07.320 --> 42:09.480
Till then, she's got Mundy and her dad.

42:11.800 --> 42:13.480
But her dad's dead.

42:14.360 --> 42:18.120
No, I know. I know he's not gone,
and that's sweet and everything.

42:18.120 --> 42:22.160
It's just he is--
He's really, actually, he's dead.

42:25.400 --> 42:27.160
We're all dead eventually.

42:27.160 --> 42:29.320
There's hardly any time
that we're not dead.

42:29.320 --> 42:30.400
It's a good thing too.

42:30.400 --> 42:32.680
We gotta keep the pace up.
Otherwise, nothing would get done.

42:37.920 --> 42:40.680
Dying defines us.

42:40.680 --> 42:42.720
Snow isn't snow until it falls.

42:43.880 --> 42:44.880
Snow.

42:46.000 --> 42:47.280
Yeah, snow.

42:48.280 --> 42:50.120
We all melt away in the end.

42:51.600 --> 42:53.000
But something stays.

42:57.760 --> 42:59.280
Maybe the best part.

43:03.280 --> 43:07.440
[chuckles] A sad, old man once told me,

43:08.360 --> 43:11.920
"What survives of us is love."

- Who's she?

43:46.880 --> 43:48.120
Doctor.

43:48.120 --> 43:50.720
Where is the Doctor? Where is he?

43:52.320 --> 43:53.840
- Who is she?
- I don't know!
