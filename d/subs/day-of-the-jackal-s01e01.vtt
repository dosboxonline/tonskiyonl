the surgeon said they need
to operate again on the leg.

21:27.400 --> 21:30.440
Russian 2000 MG.

21:30.440 --> 21:33.280
Not something you see every day.

21:34.440 --> 21:36.600
Hmm, the serial number's filed off.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.640
Well, terrorists aren't
entirely stupid.

21:38.640 --> 21:41.640
So, is it the genuine article?

21:41.640 --> 21:43.600
Yeah, looks like the real thing.

21:43.600 --> 21:46.240
Although the Brazilian
and Egyptian knock-offs

21:46.240 --> 21:48.080
are almost as good these days.

21:48.080 --> 21:49.360
Very nice gun.

21:49.360 --> 21:51.720
Right, let's see if it's
one of our Belgian dealers.

21:52.640 --> 21:55.120
There's gotta be another one
in here somewhere.

21:57.400 --> 22:00.120
They're not always entirely stupid,

22:00.120 --> 22:02.240
but they're not that smart either.

22:02.240 --> 22:04.040
Bingo.

22:04.040 --> 22:06.560
Have you seen this?

22:08.960 --> 22:11.080
Where is that?

22:11.080 --> 22:13.120
Germany.

22:19.720 --> 22:22.080
That is an absolutely...

22:22.080 --> 22:23.960
beautiful thing.

22:23.960 --> 22:26.760
You know I could have
shipped them to you and, er...

22:26.760 --> 22:28.600
saved you the journey.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.480
What and miss seeing all this?
No, thank you.

22:30.480 --> 22:33.000
Christ, the Puzzle Ball's
something special.

22:33.000 --> 22:35.600
Yes, it is.

22:35.600 --> 22:37.480
Sadly not for sale.

22:37.480 --> 22:40.560
However, I do have
a beautiful Killarney set...

22:40.560 --> 22:43.920
that I might be persuaded
to part with.

22:43.920 --> 22:46.080
Go on then.
This way.

22:51.880 --> 22:53.880

22:55.560 --> 22:58.240
Herr Krasner,
with the greatest respect...

22:58.240 --> 23:00.560
Mm-hm?
...I need to get out of here

23:00.560 --> 23:03.000
before I bankrupt myself.

23:11.120 --> 23:13.760
Tech entrepreneur,
Ulle Dag Charles,

23:13.760 --> 23:16.240
or UDC as he prefers to be known...
Hey.

23:16.240 --> 23:18.920
Hey.

23:18.920 --> 23:21.160
You alright?
Yeah, I'm good. How are you doing?

23:21.160 --> 23:23.560
Yeah, I'm...

23:23.560 --> 23:25.680
Yeah.
Yeah. You want a glass?

23:25.680 --> 23:27.840
No, I'm good. Thank you.

23:27.840 --> 23:30.880
...he calls River.
Ulle Dag Charles, what is this

23:30.880 --> 23:33.400
mysterious new software, River?

23:33.400 --> 23:36.720
River is a revolutionary
technology...

23:36.720 --> 23:38.880
Er, how's the paper?

23:38.880 --> 23:41.480
I finally came up with
a new title for it, actually.

23:41.480 --> 23:43.560
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
What is it?

23:43.560 --> 23:47.600
It's called, "Problematic
Violences and Self-Authorship:

23:47.600 --> 23:50.360
Traps of the Messianic
and the Tragic."

23:50.360 --> 23:52.360
Thank you.

23:52.360 --> 23:55.880
What does it actually mean, though?

23:55.880 --> 23:58.720
Come on, you learned firearms,
you know what it means.

23:58.720 --> 24:01.040
Where's Jasmine? Homework?

24:01.040 --> 24:03.400
Homework, exactly.
Why is a man who is a founder member

24:03.400 --> 24:06.960
of the billionaire club turning
against his fellow billionaires?

24:06.960 --> 24:09.480
Can we find something
on the Fest killing, please?

24:09.480 --> 24:11.520
Come on, this is UDC.
You should be all over this.

24:11.520 --> 24:13.400
He's got like 240 million followers.

24:13.400 --> 24:15.440
Some people think he's God.
Yeah, including him.

24:15.440 --> 24:17.520
- Look at him.
- You never know
with this guy, though.

24:17.520 --> 24:19.840
I mean, if this software does
what it's supposed to,

24:19.840 --> 24:22.120
it's gonna show us where
all the big money's coming from

24:22.120 --> 24:23.960
and where it goes.
Like, if he pulls this off,

24:23.960 --> 24:25.440
this could get really interesting.

24:25.440 --> 24:28.080
But it's not interesting right now.
Someone's been assassinated.

24:28.080 --> 24:29.360
It is to me.
Can you ju...

24:29.360 --> 24:31.400
No! Listen,
you can't just come here...

24:31.400 --> 24:33.880
Give me it.
Come home... Fine, fine, fine.

24:33.880 --> 24:36.320
Take it. Wow, no respect
for your husband, no?

24:36.320 --> 24:38.240
Thank you.

24:38.240 --> 24:42.440
According to police sources,
Fest was struck by a single bullet

24:42.440 --> 24:45.360
fired by a sniper from long range.

24:45.360 --> 24:47.840
It's not yet confirmed
if authorities

24:47.840 --> 24:50.480
have been able
to locate a suspect or...

24:50.480 --> 24:52.840
Evening, Mum.
Hi, how you doing?

24:52.840 --> 24:54.560
How was school?
Good.

24:54.560 --> 24:57.160
Good. Good.

24:57.160 --> 24:59.280
Do you remember what's
happening tomorrow night?

24:59.280 --> 25:01.400
Yes.

25:01.400 --> 25:03.760
Parent-teachers' evening.

25:03.760 --> 25:09.000
Yes. I'm going to come.

25:09.000 --> 25:11.160
Good.
Alright?

25:11.160 --> 25:13.640
OK.
..was visiting his son,

25:13.640 --> 25:16.920
Elias Fest,
at the Saint Elizabeth hospital,

25:16.920 --> 25:19.160
who had suffered injuries
the day prior.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.960
I offered. She wants you.

25:21.960 --> 25:24.160
...a connection
between these incidents,

25:24.160 --> 25:27.480
forming a broader conspiracy
against the Fest family.

25:39.320 --> 25:41.440
Passport.
Ja.

25:43.760 --> 25:46.480
Do you know, this is the first time
that I've ever been asked

25:46.480 --> 25:49.400
for a passport crossing
between Germany and France.

25:49.400 --> 25:52.840
Where are you coming from?
Er, Nuremberg.

25:52.840 --> 25:55.120
Do you live in Nuremberg?

25:55.120 --> 25:58.320
Er, no, I live in Paris.
What were you doing in Nuremberg?

25:58.320 --> 26:00.760
I was visiting someone on business.

26:03.840 --> 26:06.360
Is this your car?
No, it's a rental.

26:07.240 --> 26:09.600
Open the boot.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.000
Open it, please.

26:32.240 --> 26:34.240
What's happening here?

26:34.240 --> 26:36.280
Nothing to worry about.

26:42.720 --> 26:44.560
What's in the box?

26:44.560 --> 26:47.160
Ah, so this...

26:47.160 --> 26:49.640
is why I was in Nuremberg.

26:52.240 --> 26:54.440
This...

26:54.440 --> 26:57.040
is a Jaques set.

26:58.360 --> 27:01.960
The ivory is all pre-ban.

27:03.520 --> 27:06.240
And it's, er...
it's incredibly rare.

27:06.240 --> 27:08.280
I collect these things.

27:11.040 --> 27:13.040
Wait here.

28:00.760 --> 28:02.720
You can go.
Thank you very much.

28:02.720 --> 28:04.960

29:20.080 --> 29:21.840
Should be on your screen now.

29:21.840 --> 29:24.680
Single shot to the head.
A lot of splatter.

29:24.680 --> 29:26.640
Bloody good shot.

29:26.640 --> 29:29.880
No, that can't be right.
What?

29:29.880 --> 29:32.640
3,815 metres.

29:32.640 --> 29:35.720
But that... that's not possible.

29:35.720 --> 29:37.720
Well, it's what
the Germans are saying.

29:37.720 --> 29:40.360
And we know how precise
the Germans are.

29:40.360 --> 29:43.160
What's-What's going on?
They've called a meeting about it.

29:43.160 --> 29:45.880
Osi. Osi.

29:45.880 --> 29:48.040
I should be at the Fest meeting.

29:48.040 --> 29:50.280
You'll get a full briefing
- afterwards.
- No, no, no, no.

29:50.280 --> 29:52.920
I don't want a full briefing.
Snipers is my patch.

29:52.920 --> 29:56.440
I didn't draw up the names, Bianca.
Well, wait, wait, wait.

29:56.440 --> 29:59.480
Who did? Was it Isabel?
I assume so.

29:59.480 --> 30:02.600
Well... Look. Jordan's in there.

30:02.600 --> 30:05.640
Jordan.
What does Jordan know about snipers?

30:06.880 --> 30:10.160
I have to be in there.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.440
Who is that anyway?

30:12.440 --> 30:14.560
Werner Leckner, German Intelligence.

30:14.560 --> 30:17.160
Last night there were arson attacks

30:17.160 --> 30:19.640
on mosques in Hamburg,
Berlin and Dresden.

30:19.640 --> 30:22.200
And there's been rioting
in different parts of the country.

30:22.200 --> 30:24.160
It's obviously very alarming,
Werner.

30:24.160 --> 30:26.280
And as you know,
the Foreign Secretary

30:26.280 --> 30:28.920
was a personal friend of the Fest
family. He's very shocked.

30:28.920 --> 30:32.320
As are we all.
What do you need from us?

30:32.320 --> 30:34.040
We are not making any assumptions

30:34.040 --> 30:36.280
about the nationality
of the sniper,

30:36.280 --> 30:37.440
so we are reaching out to all

30:37.440 --> 30:39.520
our international partners
for assistance.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.840
There's been a lot of speculation
about the shot.

30:41.840 --> 30:44.000
Do you have a confirmed distance?

30:44.000 --> 30:46.360
Yes, indeed, um...

30:47.280 --> 30:50.440
From the apartment block
where the shot was taken

30:50.440 --> 30:52.760
to the hospital door
where Fest was hit is,

30:52.760 --> 30:55.480
er... 3,815 metres.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.720
Are you sure about that?

30:57.720 --> 31:01.000
Because the world record for
a confirmed kill with a sniper rifle

31:01.000 --> 31:03.720
is 3,540 metres.

31:03.720 --> 31:06.400
Ukraine, 2023.

31:06.400 --> 31:09.080
Did you retrieve the weapon?
No.

31:09.080 --> 31:11.240
Right, so the sniper
took it with him.

31:11.240 --> 31:13.720
This is the suspect leaving
the apartment building,

31:13.720 --> 31:16.640
two minutes and 52 seconds
after the shot was fired.

31:16.640 --> 31:18.800
But... er, sorry, where's the rifle?

31:18.800 --> 31:21.880
He broke it down and put it
in the bag. Obviously.

31:21.880 --> 31:24.600
Can we get dimensions, please?

31:31.240 --> 31:33.520
The bag is less
than 60 centimetres tall.

31:33.520 --> 31:37.200
So?
The Tac-50 barrel is 737 millimetres

31:37.200 --> 31:39.800
and it's the shortest around
in this category.

31:39.800 --> 31:42.080
The Denel barrel is
a full metre long.

31:42.080 --> 31:44.440
The-The-The rifle's not in the bag.

31:44.440 --> 31:46.640
If it was in the bag,
we'd see the barrel poking out.

31:46.640 --> 31:48.520
He left it behind.

31:48.520 --> 31:51.200
No, forensics found no trace
of a weapon at the scene.

31:51.200 --> 31:53.840
When a sniper finds a rifle,

31:53.840 --> 31:56.440
one that allows him
to make a shot at that distance,

31:56.440 --> 31:58.480
that rifle is a keeper.

31:58.480 --> 32:00.800
He's never going to leave it behind.

32:00.800 --> 32:02.640
Which means he took it with him.

32:02.640 --> 32:05.520
And if he took it with him,
then it has to be in that bag.

32:05.520 --> 32:08.440
I'm not following, Bianca.

32:09.280 --> 32:11.520
You said the bag isn't big enough?

32:11.520 --> 32:14.600
Which means the rifle is bespoke.

32:14.600 --> 32:17.320
The barrel came in two parts.
A...

32:17.320 --> 32:21.400
barrel in two parts is
the gunmaker's holy grail.

32:21.400 --> 32:23.880
If the rifling were out
the tiniest fraction,

32:23.880 --> 32:26.120
it would compromise the shot.
It's impossible.

32:26.120 --> 32:29.320
There's a gunmaker who's been
trying to do this for years.

32:29.320 --> 32:31.720
His name is Norman Stoke.

32:33.200 --> 32:35.880
Is Mr Stoke British?

32:35.880 --> 32:39.440
Northern Irish.
Well...

32:39.440 --> 32:42.560
I suppose they count as British,
for now.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.640
Do we know where Mr Stoke is?

32:44.640 --> 32:46.320
Can we get Special Branch
to scoop him up?

32:46.320 --> 32:49.320
He's been on the run since
the Stockholm assassination in 2018.

32:49.320 --> 32:52.400
How unfortunate.
But I have an asset.

32:52.400 --> 32:54.840
I know I can find him.

32:54.840 --> 32:57.000
What good would that do us?

32:57.000 --> 32:59.520
Oh, well, gunmaker makes gun.

32:59.520 --> 33:01.880
Gunmaker sells gun to assassin.

33:01.880 --> 33:05.080
Highly speculative.
It is a lead, however.

33:05.080 --> 33:07.360
And, to be frank,
we don't have many of those.

33:22.600 --> 33:24.480
Bonjour.
Bonjour.

33:31.440 --> 33:33.840
Bianca. A moment, please.

33:49.280 --> 33:51.680
It's always flattering
when the Germans come asking

33:51.680 --> 33:53.880
for our expertise.

33:54.920 --> 33:56.960
Although it would be
a little embarrassing

33:56.960 --> 33:59.440
if the gunmaker turns out
to be British.

33:59.440 --> 34:02.600
Who exactly is this Norman Stoke?

34:02.600 --> 34:06.160
Stoke started making machine-guns
for loyalist paramilitaries

34:06.160 --> 34:08.880
back in the '80s in East Belfast.

34:08.880 --> 34:12.120
Norman and his brother Larry,
killed more than a dozen

34:12.120 --> 34:14.200
innocent Catholic civilians.

34:14.200 --> 34:16.360
Larry was eventually caught
and went to prison

34:16.360 --> 34:19.080
but was released
under the peace agreement.

34:19.080 --> 34:21.640
Er, he's now an enforcer
for a gang of drug dealers.

34:21.640 --> 34:24.760
Norman, meanwhile,
perfected his craft

34:24.760 --> 34:28.200
and made the gun used
in the Stockholm assassination.

34:28.200 --> 34:30.760
How would you go about
finding Norman Stoke?

34:30.760 --> 34:33.280
I have an asset in Belfast.

34:33.280 --> 34:35.280
Codename Sparrow.

34:38.120 --> 34:40.880
I've heard good things
about you, Bianca.

34:44.960 --> 34:46.960
Don't let me down.

34:47.920 --> 34:49.920
Yeah.

36:30.120 --> 36:32.680
Hey.
Hey.

36:32.680 --> 36:35.400
You look like you're at an airport.

36:35.400 --> 36:38.240
Yeah, sorry.
But what about parents' evening?

36:38.240 --> 36:40.760
So, I'm assuming you're not coming?

36:40.760 --> 36:42.800
It's a last-minute thing.

36:42.800 --> 36:46.120
You know, she's really
worked her socks off this term.

36:46.120 --> 36:50.280
I know, I know. I feel awful about
it. There was nothing I could do.

36:50.280 --> 36:52.680
Well, you could try
telling her yourself?

36:52.680 --> 36:55.320
Paul, I can't, I can't.
I-I've just got to Belfast

36:55.320 --> 36:57.480
and I'm-I'm already late
for a meeting.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.800
Right, OK.
Can you do it, please?

36:59.800 --> 37:01.760
OK.
Look, I will try my best

37:01.760 --> 37:03.880
to get on the last flight.
OK.OK?

37:03.880 --> 37:06.480
I'm sorry.
Alright, bye, bye.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.680
OK, bye.

39:00.600 --> 39:03.640
When I saw your number,
I almost had a stroke.

39:04.600 --> 39:06.640
Thought I'd seen the last of you.

39:06.640 --> 39:08.800
It has been a long time.

39:10.000 --> 39:12.000
How've you been?

39:13.720 --> 39:16.840
What do you want, Nadine?
How's the family?

39:16.840 --> 39:19.000
Leave my family out of it.

39:19.000 --> 39:21.560
If Larry knew who I was talking to,
he'd kill me.

39:25.920 --> 39:27.920
There you go.
Thanks ever so much.

39:27.920 --> 39:29.640
Do come back and see us.

39:29.640 --> 39:32.960
Have a good day.

39:32.960 --> 39:35.120
But you're being careful?

39:35.120 --> 39:38.040
You remember the protocols?
Yes.

39:38.040 --> 39:40.160
Good.

39:40.160 --> 39:42.640
Then there's nothing
for you to worry about.

39:44.800 --> 39:48.000
When was the last time Larry
spoke to his brother, Norman?

39:50.880 --> 39:52.960
Not since he disappeared.

39:52.960 --> 39:55.400
Are you telling me
the truth, Alison?

39:56.680 --> 39:59.760
I know the brothers are close
and I need to find Norman now.

40:01.000 --> 40:03.000
Not my problem.

40:11.160 --> 40:13.120
It's very much your problem,

40:13.120 --> 40:15.280
because if you don't help me
find Norman,

40:15.280 --> 40:17.840
you'll go back to prison.

40:20.960 --> 40:23.280
Are you married?

40:23.280 --> 40:25.240
No.
Children?

40:25.240 --> 40:27.640
Nope.
Career woman.

40:27.640 --> 40:29.560
It's written all over you.

40:31.080 --> 40:34.880
If you had a husband, you'd know
men have their little secrets.

40:34.880 --> 40:37.960
Well, this is a little secret
I want in on.

40:39.160 --> 40:42.800
I need you to find out
where Norman is today.

40:54.400 --> 40:56.800
I can't just ask Larry out the blue.

40:56.800 --> 41:00.480
He'll be suspicious.
I'd have to work up to it.

41:02.560 --> 41:04.560
You've got my number.

41:04.560 --> 41:07.280
I expect to hear from you tonight.

41:11.320 --> 41:13.360
Can I go now?

41:15.320 --> 41:17.440
It's a free country.

42:54.880 --> 42:57.520
This is Alison.
Leave a message.

42:58.440 --> 43:01.800
Alison, it's Nadine.

43:01.800 --> 43:05.280
I haven't heard from you
and I'm very disappointed. Call me.

43:07.240 --> 43:09.240
Nadine?

43:10.920 --> 43:13.680
Oh, office in-joke.

43:16.760 --> 43:19.240
Look, baby, I'm so sorry.

43:19.240 --> 43:21.840
You know, about parents' evening.
I really am.

45:04.280 --> 45:06.320
Don't turn around.

45:10.280 --> 45:12.280
Did you come alone?

45:13.400 --> 45:16.120
Yes, I followed
your instructions to the letter.

45:20.560 --> 45:22.560
Who's the target?

45:24.000 --> 45:27.160
Ulle Dag Charles. UDC.

45:28.280 --> 45:30.280
Can you get to him?

45:34.920 --> 45:36.920
It'll cost.

45:37.760 --> 45:40.560
I mentioned a guide price
of ten million dollars.

45:40.560 --> 45:43.960
Multiply that by ten and then
perhaps we can have a conversation.

45:46.920 --> 45:49.360
That's a very expensive
conversation.

45:50.320 --> 45:52.240
Half on commission,
half on completion.

45:52.240 --> 45:54.160
All reasonable expenses paid.

45:54.160 --> 45:57.440
Well, I'd have to consult
my colleagues about that.

46:02.840 --> 46:04.840
Hello?

46:08.160 --> 46:11.040
Alison, it's Nadine. You were
supposed to call me last night.

46:11.040 --> 46:13.080
I need to hear from you.

46:15.280 --> 46:18.360
Er, get me everything we have
on Alison's daughter, Emma.

46:18.360 --> 46:20.400
- Copy.
- Yeah?
Yeah, yeah. On it.

46:25.920 --> 46:27.920
The BND believe, er...

46:31.040 --> 46:34.120
The BND believe our sniper
thought he'd find Manfred

46:34.120 --> 46:36.920
at the Fest Und Fest Unternehme
offices the night before.

46:36.920 --> 46:41.000
But Manfred wasn't there
so he shot his son, Elias.

46:41.000 --> 46:43.320
Manfred was always the real target.

46:44.240 --> 46:48.080
Elias was used as bait
to lure Manfred to the hospital.

46:48.080 --> 46:50.280
That would take
a lot of pre-planning.

46:50.280 --> 46:52.480
Well, all planning is pre.

46:53.480 --> 46:55.560
How did Belfast go?

46:55.560 --> 46:58.360
My asset isn't cooperating.

46:58.360 --> 47:02.000
I think we have to get
creative on this one.

47:02.000 --> 47:04.840
She has a daughter, Emma.

47:04.840 --> 47:06.920
A student in London.

47:06.920 --> 47:09.760
Involved in a radical leftist group.

47:09.760 --> 47:12.320
I think I can see where
you're going with this.

47:14.120 --> 47:16.120
We have to be very careful

47:16.120 --> 47:18.640
about sanctioning
this kind of operation.

47:23.840 --> 47:27.920
CROWD
UDC! UDC! UDC! UDC!

47:27.920 --> 47:30.600
What do we want?!
The truth about money!

47:30.600 --> 47:32.800
When do we want it?
Now!

47:32.800 --> 47:36.280
UDC! UDC! UDC!

47:36.280 --> 47:39.520
River's here to make it clear!

47:39.520 --> 47:42.000
You can't wash
your money here!

47:42.000 --> 47:45.680
UDC! UDC! UDC! UDC!

47:45.680 --> 47:47.640
Yep, that's her in the pink scarf.

47:47.640 --> 47:49.960
Do I have to wait for her to act up?

47:49.960 --> 47:51.960
No. Just go get her.

47:51.960 --> 47:54.000
Fine by me.

48:02.000 --> 48:05.040
Miss, you're causing
an obstruction in a public highway.

48:05.040 --> 48:08.840
If you do not get up and move
right now, you're liable for arrest.

48:08.840 --> 48:11.160
Why don't you go
and do something useful

48:11.160 --> 48:13.240
like arrest the fat cats...

48:15.560 --> 48:16.880
You can't wash your money here!

48:16.880 --> 48:19.360
I'm not threatening you, miss.
Well, OK, well you should try

48:19.360 --> 48:22.080
being where I am...

48:22.080 --> 48:24.160
That's a threat.
It's a threat to me.

48:24.160 --> 48:26.400
I'm being reasonable.
I'm not raising my voice

48:26.400 --> 48:30.400
in the way that you are.

48:32.400 --> 48:34.480
I don't care about your law,
I don't care!

48:34.480 --> 48:37.720
Right, that's enough.
Have 'em up. Thank you!

48:41.600 --> 48:44.160
Get your hands off me, lackey!

48:44.160 --> 48:47.280
Whose streets?!
Our streets!

48:51.320 --> 48:58.480
Whose streets?!
Our streets!

49:00.440 --> 49:02.680
Whose streets?!
Our streets!

49:12.080 --> 49:13.880
You're in very serious trouble,
Emma.

49:13.880 --> 49:16.920
You're in very serious trouble.

49:16.920 --> 49:18.960
We have four witnesses who saw you

49:18.960 --> 49:20.720
throw the bottle
at the police officer.

49:20.720 --> 49:23.000
We got four witnesses

49:23.000 --> 49:25.840
who saw you throw the bottle
at the police officer.

49:27.600 --> 49:29.600
What bottle?

49:29.600 --> 49:32.840
What are you talking about?
Nobody was throwing anything.

49:32.840 --> 49:35.080
You didn't even ask
about the officer.

49:35.080 --> 49:37.680
She was badly hurt.
I didn't throw any bottle.

49:37.680 --> 49:40.760
The officer's gonna lose
her right eye.

49:40.760 --> 49:44.200
She's gonna lose her right eye,
since you didn't ask.

49:44.200 --> 49:46.640
Just a young woman,

49:46.640 --> 49:49.000
doing her job.

49:49.000 --> 49:51.800
How's that make you feel, Emma?

49:51.800 --> 49:54.360
You're making this up.

49:54.360 --> 49:56.800
So fuck right off.

49:56.800 --> 49:58.960
And I want a solicitor.

49:58.960 --> 50:01.600
I have a right to a solicitor.

50:01.600 --> 50:04.120
You can call your mother.

50:05.040 --> 50:07.040
You can call your mother.

50:26.560 --> 50:28.880
This way, please.

50:35.960 --> 50:38.320
Fuck off me!
Get in there.

50:38.320 --> 50:40.560
Where's my solicitor?!

50:40.560 --> 50:43.280
Where's my solicitor?!
This is illegal!

52:11.040 --> 52:13.080
Oh, my God!

52:17.280 --> 52:19.480
I wasn't expecting you
until next week.

52:19.480 --> 52:22.000
What and miss Carlito's birthday?
Not happening.

52:34.440 --> 52:36.640
Talk to me.
She was like this when I found her.

52:36.640 --> 52:39.320
She's still alive.
I've called the paramedics.

52:45.160 --> 52:47.840
"At the tone,
please record your message."

52:47.840 --> 52:49.840
