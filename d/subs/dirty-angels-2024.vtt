[in Pashto]

02:23.444 --> 02:25.346
[shouting in Pashto]

02:42.896 --> 02:46.133
You would have thought
one example
would be enough for them.

02:47.568 --> 02:49.370
Let's see
if you can convince them.

02:53.807 --> 02:56.544
[grunts, pants]

03:35.349 --> 03:39.186
[in Pashto]

04:07.348 --> 04:08.449
Pick it up.

04:14.722 --> 04:16.023
Now.

04:24.231 --> 04:25.366

06:12.506 --> 06:13.641
Don't leave them!

06:14.274 --> 06:15.242
Stop!

06:15.342 --> 06:16.877
Stop, you hear me?

06:17.611 --> 06:18.978
Don't you leave them!

06:18.979 --> 06:21.882
Get the fuck back down there,
you hear me!

06:22.650 --> 06:23.751
Stop!

06:25.352 --> 06:26.487
No.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.726
[gunshot]
No!

07:07.528 --> 07:10.196
I'm sorry,
but he was really short.

07:10.197 --> 07:11.398
I know, right!

07:12.700 --> 07:14.802
[chattering continues]

07:20.073 --> 07:21.809
You want to hear
the latest?

07:21.909 --> 07:23.110
Another proposal?

07:23.210 --> 07:25.479
Now you're just bragging.
[laughs]

07:25.579 --> 07:27.379
Our butcher
came to my father

07:27.380 --> 07:30.216
and offered him
my weight in beef
to marry his son.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.383
[friend] Whoo!

07:31.384 --> 07:33.787
So, like a dozen patties?

07:33.887 --> 07:35.221
Exactly! [laughs]

07:35.222 --> 07:37.324
Wait, McDonald's
for the reception?

07:37.424 --> 07:39.058
Get me a Big Mac
and I'll marry your butcher.

07:39.059 --> 07:40.426
[laughs]
Oh!

07:40.427 --> 07:42.095
That's why they call it
a happy meal.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.464
- And for fries?
- For fries, I would--

07:44.565 --> 07:46.767
- [gunfire in distance]
- [shouting in distance]

07:55.809 --> 07:57.409
Taliban.

07:57.410 --> 07:58.779
ISIS.

08:01.448 --> 08:03.416
[shouting in Pashto]

08:14.094 --> 08:16.664
- [gunshots]
- [students screaming]

08:22.269 --> 08:24.137
Out! Out! Out! Out!

08:24.237 --> 08:26.339
[screaming continues]

08:31.011 --> 08:32.345
Fuck going down!

08:32.445 --> 08:33.714
The roof.

08:33.814 --> 08:34.948
Go, go, go!

08:36.283 --> 08:37.685
[gunshots continue]

08:40.320 --> 08:41.789

[soldier shouting in Pashto]

09:39.579 --> 09:40.614
[in Pashto]

09:51.324 --> 09:53.393
Which one is
the whore Durani's daughter?

10:00.167 --> 10:03.036
Which one of you is
the daughter of Camila Durani?

10:03.737 --> 10:04.938
Traitor to her people.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.106
She wasn't here today.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.240
She called in sick.

10:07.340 --> 10:09.442
[students screaming]

10:14.948 --> 10:16.316
[soldier shouts in Pashto]

10:20.721 --> 10:22.622
They're going to
come up here.

10:22.723 --> 10:24.758
Car park.
I can drive.

10:39.539 --> 10:41.474
[screams]

10:53.086 --> 10:54.021
[in Pashto]

11:09.102 --> 11:10.337
[gun clicks]

11:17.778 --> 11:19.512
He's coming. He's coming.

11:25.418 --> 11:27.554
You are the daughter
of the whore

11:27.654 --> 11:29.823
who forces learning on girls
in defiance of the Prophet.

11:29.923 --> 11:31.958
The Taliban
at least read the Quran.

11:31.959 --> 11:36.496
If you are ISIS, you know
your founder couldn't even
read his own name.

11:36.596 --> 11:38.231
[chuckles]

11:38.331 --> 11:42.301
So, I am speaking
to an educated woman?
Yes, you are.

11:42.302 --> 11:46.173
Well, I don't need to explain
that there is a price
to be paid for arrogance.

11:46.840 --> 11:48.375
[grunts]

11:48.475 --> 11:51.011
[crying]
You fled here
with your cowardly parents.

11:51.678 --> 11:52.712
Look at you.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.748
You could have
made good wives

11:54.848 --> 11:57.217
if her mother
hadn't poisoned you.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.087
[girls screaming]

12:00.187 --> 12:02.389
No! No! No!

12:02.489 --> 12:03.390
Stop!

12:03.490 --> 12:05.325
No! No!

12:05.993 --> 12:07.928
[screaming]

12:12.732 --> 12:14.935
Stop! No!

12:16.136 --> 12:19.106
[leader on TV] <i>Those girls
who may be redeemed will be.</i>

12:19.206 --> 12:21.341
<i>For the daughters
of the American diplomats</i>

12:21.474 --> 12:23.376
<i>and for those
who are beyond redemption,</i>

12:23.476 --> 12:25.712
<i>ten million dollars each</i>

12:25.813 --> 12:27.714
<i>and the release
of Sheik al-Shimali,</i>

12:27.848 --> 12:31.184
<i>a holy man,
imprisoned by the corrupt
Taliban government.</i>

12:31.651 --> 12:32.752
<i>Five days.</i>

12:40.293 --> 12:42.429
[speaking in Pashto]

12:47.667 --> 12:49.102
They're gonna kill us.

12:49.202 --> 12:51.238
No, they won't.
We're worth something.

12:52.239 --> 12:54.574
Unlike my friends.

12:54.674 --> 12:57.444
Weren't you the one
who told them
they'd be safe on the roof?

12:57.544 --> 12:58.812
We all heard you.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.880
- How did that work out?
- Leave her alone.

13:00.881 --> 13:04.216
- Okay? That wasn't her fault.
- Really? Then ask her friends.

13:04.217 --> 13:07.553
Halle, you're alive right now
because your father
is the ambassador

13:07.554 --> 13:09.555
and our parents
are deputy ministers.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.159
But of course,
if you ever got your nose
out of that TikTok,

13:12.259 --> 13:15.462
you'd know that America
doesn't pay ransoms
to terrorists.

13:15.562 --> 13:17.664
So maybe wipe
that smug look off your face

13:17.764 --> 13:19.899
and realize that we're all
pretty close to dying.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.569
Or being given
to ISIS fighters.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.805
- What?
- Look around.

13:26.739 --> 13:29.342
They took maybe 50 girls
from the school.

13:29.442 --> 13:31.578
Where do you think
they are right now?

13:32.712 --> 13:33.847
Hmm?

13:41.889 --> 13:43.656
[in Pashto]

14:09.182 --> 14:10.483
[door opens]

14:20.693 --> 14:22.996
- This being 1106--
- [colonel]
Let's hold that for a second.

14:23.096 --> 14:26.033
Captain, you've been
up my ass for a year
and now you have your moment.

14:26.133 --> 14:29.036
But before
you humiliate yourself
and the service,

14:29.136 --> 14:32.039
I'm gonna give you
one last chance
to withdraw your complaint.

14:33.173 --> 14:35.307
With all respect, sir--
Fuck your respect.

14:35.308 --> 14:39.311
Warrant Officer Collins there
flew into hostile territory
and saved your life.

14:39.312 --> 14:42.415
A mission that cost the lives
of his fellow pilot
and four Rangers,

14:42.515 --> 14:45.352
wounding two others
as he was almost
shot out of the air.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.755
And yet, you want him
charged with cowardice.

14:48.855 --> 14:53.193
Perhaps the colonel would
understand if he watched
his men be executed,

14:53.293 --> 14:55.929
while Warrant Officer Collins
chose safety over duty.

14:56.029 --> 14:57.030
Safety?

14:57.130 --> 14:59.266
You're right, Captain.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.668
That must have been
a terrible decision to make.

15:02.802 --> 15:06.073
Maybe similar to one you made
just a week before that.

15:06.173 --> 15:08.708
Something some people think
you should have
been prosecuted for.

15:08.808 --> 15:11.744
- Extenuating circumstances
or not.
- Yes, sir.

15:11.844 --> 15:15.048
But you're willing
for all that to come out again
and risk prison yourself.

15:15.148 --> 15:18.017
I'm willing to
take responsibility
for my actions.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.452
He should as well.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.355
Fine.

15:23.656 --> 15:26.126
Me, I'm gonna wait
until Monday.

15:26.226 --> 15:28.628
Because I'm not in the mood
to ruin my weekend.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.031
We can go back on the record.

15:32.332 --> 15:34.134
The session
is adjourned at 1108.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.369
Get the fuck out of here.

15:42.775 --> 15:45.278
[door opens, closes]

15:45.378 --> 15:47.780
[fighters grunting]

15:51.351 --> 15:52.819
[grunts]

15:59.192 --> 16:01.228
[grunts]
[groans]

16:08.868 --> 16:10.103
[captain] Tap out.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.005
Tap out, fucker!

16:14.307 --> 16:15.442
[grunts]

16:20.480 --> 16:22.582
[both straining]

16:24.784 --> 16:26.353
You tap out, bitch.

16:45.772 --> 16:48.375
I heard you've been
making friends.

16:48.475 --> 16:50.643
Nice to see
with my own eyes, though.

16:52.312 --> 16:53.645
[sighs]
Fuck you, Travis.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.382
It should be fuck you, sir,

16:55.482 --> 16:57.717
but after that,
I don't think
I'll pick a fight.

16:58.418 --> 16:59.686
I lost.

16:59.786 --> 17:01.854
Yeah, he seems
to be savoring his victory.

17:02.755 --> 17:04.191
Hit the showers.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.892
Can't talk to someone
who smells like a horse.

17:06.659 --> 17:08.460
I know why you're here.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.198
- And you're
not gonna stop me--
- From blowing your career?

17:12.632 --> 17:13.866
Wouldn't waste my breath.

17:14.434 --> 17:16.403
Shower. Seriously.

17:32.985 --> 17:34.320
When?

17:34.321 --> 17:35.888
I leave for D.C.
in an hour.

17:35.988 --> 17:38.558
Hopefully they know more
than they did last night.

17:38.658 --> 17:42.661
I got you a seat on a C-5
departing at 1600 hours
from Wiesbaden.

17:42.662 --> 17:44.663
You fly commercial
from there.

17:44.664 --> 17:47.200
This has nothing to do
with the big brass' worry

17:47.300 --> 17:51.503
that my testimony is gonna
take the shine off the Army's
glistening reputation.

17:51.504 --> 17:53.339
It's a closed hearing.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.108
Whatever you're gonna say
is never gonna leave
that room,

17:55.208 --> 17:57.008
and you know it.

17:57.009 --> 17:59.912
The only head on a pike
outside on the gate
is gonna be yours.

18:00.012 --> 18:02.081
So you're here
to save me from myself.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.416
I won't say
I could give a fuck,

18:03.516 --> 18:05.552
as we both know
that would be a lie.

18:05.652 --> 18:07.454
But right now,
I care more about them.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.633
This is CIA bullshit.

18:21.568 --> 18:22.935
Send in Delta.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.572
We did, rescue mission
three days ago.

18:26.038 --> 18:28.074
No survivors.

18:28.175 --> 18:32.579
So this CIA bullshit is
the only hope these girls have
of seeing next week.

18:32.679 --> 18:35.046
We're going in
as an international
relief organization.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.116
Has to be 60% women
to be believable.

18:37.217 --> 18:38.985
There are a lot
of good Rangers.

18:39.085 --> 18:41.720
And you'd be surprised
how many are women.

18:41.721 --> 18:43.089
International.

18:43.190 --> 18:44.924
[laughs]

18:45.024 --> 18:47.627
Some mercenaries
from Kurd-fuckistan?

18:47.727 --> 18:49.728
I'm sure
they're the best of the best.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.598
When you meet these two,

18:51.698 --> 18:53.733
you can ask them
how many kills
they had in Ukraine.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.502
Which side?

18:56.303 --> 18:58.137
It's your choice.

18:58.238 --> 19:00.440
I just figured you'd rather
take out all that anger

19:00.540 --> 19:02.509
on the guy
who hacked up your team,

19:03.443 --> 19:05.812
instead of the pilot
who saved your life.

19:07.814 --> 19:08.948
Maybe not.

19:09.048 --> 19:10.483
I think we both know

19:10.583 --> 19:12.151
the only person you want to
see pay for that crime

19:12.252 --> 19:14.354
is sitting across from me.

19:17.590 --> 19:19.792
Canadian passport and ID.

19:19.892 --> 19:21.694
I managed to find
the one photo

19:21.794 --> 19:23.963
where you didn't have
a middle finger
in front of your face.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.833
So, you know I'm going?

19:28.134 --> 19:31.204
Seven years and I still know
almost nothing
about you, Jake.

19:32.472 --> 19:33.973
This would be the exception.

19:42.615 --> 19:43.716
Jessica Rabbit?

19:44.917 --> 19:46.285
Rabit.

19:46.286 --> 19:48.688
It's a proud,
proud French-Canadian name.

19:55.662 --> 19:57.797
[helicopter blades whirring]

20:08.675 --> 20:09.709
Miss Rabbit?

20:09.809 --> 20:11.310
Rabit, one B.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.412
Where's the car?

20:12.512 --> 20:14.414
Let me take your bag.
No. Car.

20:14.514 --> 20:16.249
It would look bad.
It is my job.

20:17.384 --> 20:19.185
Thank you.

20:19.286 --> 20:22.221
I was going to ask you
if you have any relation
to this famous--

20:22.322 --> 20:24.724
She's a fucking cartoon.
How would I be related to her?

20:24.824 --> 20:26.058
But they draw
someone, right?

20:26.158 --> 20:28.528
So maybe your mother--
Car.

20:30.297 --> 20:31.398
Car.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.207
Sorry for my car.
People drive crazy
in Pakistan.

20:45.712 --> 20:47.680
[horns beeping]

20:53.219 --> 20:55.522
- [tires screech]
- [horn blares]

20:58.691 --> 21:00.259
Holy shit!

21:00.693 --> 21:02.462
See? Crazy!

21:07.534 --> 21:08.968
[tires screech]

21:19.111 --> 21:20.980
No, no. No need.

21:21.981 --> 21:23.816
I'm celebrating being alive.

21:25.418 --> 21:27.520
You put that
toward a nice coffin.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.755
Thank you.

21:34.894 --> 21:37.228
Jessica. Raquel.

21:37.229 --> 21:38.397
Call me Rocky.

21:38.398 --> 21:39.599
It's Jake.

21:40.533 --> 21:43.002
Listen,
I don't need names.

21:43.102 --> 21:44.771
I won't remember
either of yours

21:44.871 --> 21:47.306
and they're probably
just as real
as Jessica Rabit.

21:48.307 --> 21:50.409
So you want what? Numbers?

21:50.410 --> 21:51.978
Functions.

21:52.078 --> 21:54.447
Then mechanic,
which is close enough.

21:54.547 --> 21:55.648
We're this way.

21:57.216 --> 21:59.185
This is someone's idea
of a safe house?

22:00.052 --> 22:01.821
The safest that's left.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.991
I'm afraid Pakistan
is no longer
the friendliest of allies.

22:05.091 --> 22:06.925
You American
or Afghan?

22:06.926 --> 22:09.028
Because you want to know
if you can trust me?

22:10.430 --> 22:13.366
I know at least one Afghan
I would trust
over Americans any day.

22:14.100 --> 22:15.301
Just one?

22:15.402 --> 22:17.268
One still living.

22:17.269 --> 22:20.473
We emigrated
after my father was executed.

22:20.573 --> 22:23.309
Tends to be
the Taliban's punishment
of first resort.

22:23.976 --> 22:25.611
By the CIA.

22:25.612 --> 22:28.447
He either shared information
with the Taliban under torture

22:28.448 --> 22:29.849
or he was a double agent.

22:29.949 --> 22:30.949
Which one was it?

22:30.950 --> 22:32.784
No way to know.

22:32.785 --> 22:34.786
And assumptions
are dangerous.

22:34.787 --> 22:37.657
If I made them, I could assume
you couldn't be trusted.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.126
Unless it isn't true
you killed
your own team leader.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.897
No. That is
absolutely true.

22:45.532 --> 22:46.965
Shot him?

22:46.966 --> 22:50.169
Rock. About the size
of a hardball.

22:50.269 --> 22:53.406
I played shortstop
in Baltimore.
You're a pitcher?

22:53.506 --> 22:56.008
You never know
when a skill
will come in handy.

22:57.009 --> 22:58.878
I'm sure he deserved to die.

23:00.046 --> 23:01.881
It was the last thing
he deserved.

23:03.550 --> 23:06.686
And I assume
you shared this tidbit
with the rest of the team?

23:07.720 --> 23:10.857
No. They shared it with me.

23:29.175 --> 23:30.943
When does Travis land?

23:31.043 --> 23:32.678
That's Rocky's chair.

23:32.679 --> 23:35.214
And I bet she's been here
long enough to find another.

23:37.817 --> 23:39.051
Travis?

23:39.151 --> 23:41.087
- [Rocky] In the air.
- Which is our Wi-Fi?

23:41.187 --> 23:43.222
The one
named Secret Secure Network.

23:43.322 --> 23:44.757
[chuckles]

23:44.857 --> 23:46.626
We have a long time
to prep, do we?

23:46.726 --> 23:49.360
You read Arabic? Daylight743?

23:49.361 --> 23:50.730
You set this up.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.264
So you're Tech, right?
Mm-hmm.

23:52.364 --> 23:54.333
Cher, no relation.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.736
She doesn't need names.
Just functions.

23:57.504 --> 23:58.870
Well, aren't you
a charmer?

23:58.871 --> 24:00.473
Call me Geek.

24:00.573 --> 24:01.574
That's Rachel.

24:01.674 --> 24:03.142
Weapons specialist.

24:03.242 --> 24:04.243
[both] Shooter!

24:04.343 --> 24:05.812
[imitating gunfire]

24:05.912 --> 24:06.979
"Shooter" it is.

24:07.079 --> 24:08.615
You already
pissed off Theresa.

24:08.715 --> 24:11.450
Explosives,
which may not have been wise.

24:11.551 --> 24:13.885
- You can call me "The Bomb."
- I like that.

24:13.886 --> 24:15.721
[The Bomb] Always wanted someone
to call me that.

24:15.722 --> 24:17.388
[Geek] You are The Bomb.
[The Bomb chuckles]

24:17.389 --> 24:19.458
Oh, and here's our medic.

24:19.559 --> 24:21.727
Hi. Was just in conference
with our real doctor.

24:21.728 --> 24:24.563
- Conference, right.
- Somebody's jealous.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.732
Girl, bah.
Not at all.

24:26.733 --> 24:28.734
I'm sure the close bond
you've established

24:28.735 --> 24:32.505
over the last, what,
seven hours has been
professional and productive.

24:32.605 --> 24:34.674
- Jane.
- She only wants functions.

24:34.774 --> 24:36.108
I thought
we'd be friends.

24:36.208 --> 24:38.110
- As you make them so easily.
- [Medic laughs]

24:38.978 --> 24:40.146
[Geek]
Oh, and here's Dr. Mike.

24:40.246 --> 24:41.814
We just call him Dr. Mike

24:41.914 --> 24:44.082
because he's the only one
going by his real name.

24:44.083 --> 24:45.818
Mike.
Jake.

24:45.918 --> 24:47.919
[Geek] Nah, nah, nah, nah.
We gonna call you Rabbit.

24:47.920 --> 24:50.690
Because what rabbits
do best is run.

24:50.790 --> 24:52.792
You see, Rabbit here
escaped a hellhole

24:52.892 --> 24:55.528
and left her whole team behind
to be slaughtered.

24:55.628 --> 24:57.964
That was after
she killed her own CO.

24:58.064 --> 24:59.431
Right, Rabbit?

25:02.268 --> 25:04.003
Look, don't take offense,
Rabbit.

25:04.103 --> 25:06.138
Dr. Mike
doesn't like us either.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.507
We're just using him
to get us across the border.

25:08.608 --> 25:11.276
Been waiting a month
for permission
from the Pakistanis

25:11.277 --> 25:12.611
to take medicine to Khost.

25:12.612 --> 25:15.682
I agree.
It magically appeared.

25:15.782 --> 25:17.183
Khost, just across the border?

25:17.283 --> 25:19.318
As far as the Taliban
will allow us to go.

25:19.418 --> 25:21.654
Also, where they're
holding the sheik.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.890
Not that we had a chance
of getting him
out of that prison.

25:23.990 --> 25:26.158
- That was the plan?
- Not one of our best.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.195
All Americans.

25:29.295 --> 25:31.797
So who is this?
[Shooter] Badia Durani.

25:31.798 --> 25:35.034
Mother was the Afghan
Minister of Education.

25:35.134 --> 25:36.836
Meeting her this morning.

25:37.336 --> 25:38.871
We're meeting her?

25:38.971 --> 25:40.707
That's on Travis.
Great.

25:41.440 --> 25:42.709
Even mom knows we're here.

25:43.843 --> 25:47.513
So, we cross the border.
Then what?

25:47.614 --> 25:50.850
Drop off the medicine,
then discover we have
a cracked distributor cap.

25:50.950 --> 25:53.185
Getting a new one
will give us two days.
Maybe three.

25:53.285 --> 25:56.689
Can't take any weapons.
Have to assume they're gonna
strip the truck.

25:56.789 --> 25:59.324
Travis's fucking weapon stash
better be there.

25:59.325 --> 26:01.527
Right.
All our ID will hold up?

26:01.628 --> 26:03.495
Names are all real staff.

26:04.163 --> 26:06.198
Six women, two men.

26:06.298 --> 26:08.199
You can count me
on their side of the column.

26:08.200 --> 26:10.069
Not wearing a fucking burqa.

26:10.169 --> 26:11.403
[chuckles]

26:11.503 --> 26:13.372
Where's the nearest
Internet café?

26:28.721 --> 26:30.022
Salaam.

26:30.589 --> 26:33.960
[speaking in Pashto]

26:51.343 --> 26:54.280
[ringing tone]

26:54.380 --> 26:55.748
[receiver, in Pashto]

26:57.516 --> 26:59.485
[in Pashto]

27:00.586 --> 27:01.888
Who is this?

27:01.988 --> 27:03.823
[Jake] <i>English.
So you're alone.</i>

27:05.892 --> 27:07.393
Tell me you're calling
from America.

27:08.427 --> 27:10.896
Awina, I need your help.

27:10.897 --> 27:13.099
I'm Taliban
and loyal to my country.

27:13.199 --> 27:16.567
And the only people who
hate ISIS more than
the Americans is your Taliban.

27:16.568 --> 27:17.837
[sighs]

27:18.805 --> 27:21.439
<i>I need to know
where the American girls are.</i>

27:21.440 --> 27:23.442
Are you insane?
How would I know?

27:23.542 --> 27:25.611
[call waiting beeps]

27:25.712 --> 27:27.013
You know how you know.

27:27.113 --> 27:28.848
Well, I don't.
No one knows.

27:28.948 --> 27:30.581
You have 12 hours
to find out.

27:30.582 --> 27:32.618
Don't come here.
I won't meet you.

27:32.719 --> 27:34.120
<i>You know that's a lie.</i>

27:34.253 --> 27:35.521
<i>And you know where.</i>

27:35.621 --> 27:38.490
[call waiting beeps]
What?

27:38.624 --> 27:41.327
[Travis] <i>How the fuck
did you get here before me
and you're still late?</i>

27:41.427 --> 27:42.260
Where?

27:42.261 --> 27:44.463
[overlapping chatter]

27:53.639 --> 27:55.606
Anything more complicated,
you go straight to medic.

27:55.607 --> 27:57.009
Anything life-threatening--
Got it, Doc.

27:57.109 --> 27:58.344
Can you give us a second?

28:00.312 --> 28:01.981
Sure.
Thank you.

28:04.083 --> 28:05.551
Got you a green tea.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.789
I hear you've been
making more friends.

28:11.157 --> 28:12.291
Friends die.

28:13.459 --> 28:15.728
Which is a pretty sure bet
after what I've seen.

28:17.663 --> 28:18.831
So,

28:20.032 --> 28:24.503
we go in, find them based on
questionable satellite data,

28:24.603 --> 28:27.840
and if we find them,
we shoot our way out.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.975
Well, it's a little more
refined than that.

28:29.976 --> 28:31.142
Yeah.

28:31.143 --> 28:32.879
I hear you have
a weapon stash.

28:32.979 --> 28:34.980
Something
for a rainy day.
You sure it's still there?

28:34.981 --> 28:37.383
They proved pretty good
at finding shit we left.

28:37.483 --> 28:39.919
Under a metal floor
I welded shut.

28:40.019 --> 28:41.520
She's early.

28:44.791 --> 28:47.559
How many people
are you telling
about your secret plan?

28:47.659 --> 28:48.659
Nobody.

28:48.660 --> 28:49.896
She found us.

28:49.996 --> 28:51.764
Beautiful.

28:54.500 --> 28:55.834
Minister.

28:55.835 --> 28:57.536
Former. Camila.

28:57.636 --> 28:59.738
You'll forgive us if we
don't introduce ourselves.

28:59.839 --> 29:01.540
I know why you're here.
That's all I need.

29:01.640 --> 29:02.942
Please, sit.

29:03.042 --> 29:04.543
I'm curious
to how you actually do know.

29:04.643 --> 29:06.177
And I wish
I could tell you.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.414
[Travis] Coffee?
This won't take long.

29:08.514 --> 29:11.050
Do you know where
my daughter is being held?

29:11.150 --> 29:13.252
We have good information.

29:13.352 --> 29:15.020
Even better
than the last time?

29:15.021 --> 29:19.258
Minister, we're risking lives
based on that information.

29:19.358 --> 29:22.360
So we're gonna do our darndest
to make sure it's right.

29:22.361 --> 29:24.096
I appreciate it.

29:24.196 --> 29:26.799
But if it turns out
your darndest
isn't good enough,

29:26.899 --> 29:29.135
I would ask you to deliver
the ransom they demand.

29:29.235 --> 29:30.970
That's 70 million dollars.

29:31.070 --> 29:32.071
Ten million.

29:32.171 --> 29:33.439
So for just your daughter?

29:34.706 --> 29:36.207
I hope to have it
by tomorrow.

29:36.208 --> 29:37.708
You know we can't do that,
Minister.

29:37.709 --> 29:39.710
I'm giving you the option,
if you need it.

29:39.711 --> 29:42.148
To save my daughter from
being publicly beheaded.

29:42.248 --> 29:45.550
- But just your daughter?
- Mine will be first.

29:45.551 --> 29:47.385
Make a show
of the Afghan girl,

29:47.386 --> 29:50.122
so the Americans
use some back channel
to pay for their own.

29:50.222 --> 29:51.757
As they have done
many times.

29:53.259 --> 29:55.127
For you to consider.

29:55.227 --> 29:57.163
I came to help you
cross the border

29:57.263 --> 29:59.498
where you may be
most at risk of discovery.

29:59.598 --> 30:01.300
Arguable.

30:01.400 --> 30:04.402
An old friend named Bashir
is a supervisor
at the crossing.

30:04.403 --> 30:06.305
- He'll help you through.
- How do we find him?

30:06.405 --> 30:09.141
Don't ask.
It will draw attention.

30:09.241 --> 30:10.776
He'll be watching for you.

30:10.877 --> 30:13.078
May Allah
watch over you as well.

30:13.079 --> 30:14.346
[Travis] Thank you.

30:15.714 --> 30:17.316
Bring me back my daughter.

30:18.985 --> 30:21.120
We'll do everything we can.

30:32.831 --> 30:34.432
Miss Rabbit, hello.

30:34.433 --> 30:35.667
Very good to see you.

30:35.767 --> 30:37.136
You have
to be fucking kidding.

30:37.236 --> 30:38.436
Come, come with me,
Miss Rabbit.

30:38.437 --> 30:40.506
Abbas. Not a chance.

30:41.773 --> 30:43.441
Enjoy the ride.

30:43.442 --> 30:44.775
And thanks for the name.

30:44.776 --> 30:46.946
Gotta find pleasure
in my work.

30:55.021 --> 30:56.155
Excuse me.

30:57.456 --> 30:59.558
Miss Rabbit, come.

30:59.658 --> 31:01.360
Let me help you.
Rabit.

31:01.460 --> 31:02.561
One B.

31:04.763 --> 31:07.632
Yes, I know.
Like the Bugs Bunny.

31:07.633 --> 31:09.134
Me, Malik.

31:09.135 --> 31:10.635
Drive, Malik.

31:10.636 --> 31:11.837
Mal-eek.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.473
[engine starts]

31:38.064 --> 31:40.199
[horns blaring]

31:50.476 --> 31:52.578
[officials speaking in Pashto]

31:57.016 --> 31:58.450
Oh, Miss Rabbit.

31:59.185 --> 32:00.619
[in Pashto]

32:09.428 --> 32:11.696
Do you have any idea
what time
our connection works?

32:11.697 --> 32:14.300
'Cause this looks like hours.
Wish I knew.

32:14.400 --> 32:15.934
Looks like
we're waiting it out.

32:16.035 --> 32:17.136
[Abbas] Boss.

32:17.236 --> 32:18.437
I fix. No worries.

32:18.537 --> 32:20.739
Abbas. Abbas!

32:32.451 --> 32:33.952
Thanks.

32:34.053 --> 32:36.155
No worries.
Abbas will fix.

32:36.855 --> 32:38.957
Bad driver, good fixer.

32:39.458 --> 32:40.659
Happy to hear that.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.229
You like music?
I like music.

32:44.230 --> 32:46.731
Taliban and ISIS hate music.

32:46.732 --> 32:48.000
Only reason I hate them.

32:48.900 --> 32:50.469
Just their problem with music?

32:51.937 --> 32:53.239
You like The Doors?

32:53.872 --> 32:54.940
I like The Doors.

32:55.041 --> 32:56.142
Steppenwolf?

32:57.743 --> 33:00.179
You have a surprising
musical vocabulary, Malik.

33:00.779 --> 33:02.848
Ma-leek.
Ma-leek.

33:02.948 --> 33:04.516
I've learned
from my brother.

33:04.616 --> 33:05.851
He plays in a cover band.

33:07.453 --> 33:09.587
Your brother, Abbas,
plays in a cover band?

33:09.588 --> 33:12.858
His favorite song,
Steppenwolf,
"Born To Be Wild."

33:13.725 --> 33:14.793
It's a great song.

33:15.761 --> 33:17.963
Bad driver,
great singer.

33:20.599 --> 33:21.833
You love your brother.

33:23.435 --> 33:24.836
Abbas saved me.

33:25.437 --> 33:26.538
Many times.

33:27.106 --> 33:28.474
I owe him everything.

33:30.576 --> 33:32.044
You know that feeling.

33:32.978 --> 33:34.113
I do.

33:35.581 --> 33:36.682
[Abbas whistles]

33:36.782 --> 33:37.849
What did I say?

33:39.818 --> 33:42.354
Good fixer.
And singer.

33:42.921 --> 33:44.322
Very good singer.

33:44.323 --> 33:45.624
Bad driver.

33:46.658 --> 33:48.026
[horn honks]

33:54.100 --> 33:55.834
[shouting in Pashto]

33:55.934 --> 33:57.802
[captain] Get back inside!

33:57.803 --> 34:00.306
[Abbas] Salaam alaikum.
Salaam alaikum.

34:01.507 --> 34:02.908
[shouting in Pashto]
Go back!

34:03.008 --> 34:04.876
What are you doing here?
Go back in line.

34:06.178 --> 34:07.579
[door closes]

34:09.981 --> 34:11.149
[captain]
You're not listening!

34:11.150 --> 34:12.983
Okay, open the truck.

34:12.984 --> 34:15.053
Everything out! Open it.

34:15.154 --> 34:17.389
[shouting in Pashto]

34:17.489 --> 34:19.158
[glass shattering]

34:22.894 --> 34:24.829
Medical supplies!
You break them!

34:24.830 --> 34:27.665
Medical supplies!
You're breaking them.

34:27.666 --> 34:29.535
You wanna kill
your own people.

34:29.635 --> 34:31.870
[guard] Shut the fuck--
[Abbas]
They are to save your people.

34:31.970 --> 34:33.272
Your own people!
You kill them!

34:33.372 --> 34:35.340
Those are medicines,
for Christ's sake.

34:35.341 --> 34:37.543
Doc, don't engage.
Get back in the car.

34:37.643 --> 34:39.578
I'm not the one--
How long since you've been
back here? Twenty years?

34:39.678 --> 34:41.079
You think the Taliban
don't respect women

34:41.180 --> 34:43.715
but are tolerant
of cross-dressers?

34:43.815 --> 34:45.584
I'm not a--
Get in the fucking car!

34:47.653 --> 34:51.390
Stop! Just stop!
Read. "Antibiotics."

34:51.490 --> 34:53.058
Drugs, you poison our people!

34:53.159 --> 34:55.060
Antibiotics,
you fucking muggle!

34:55.161 --> 34:57.396
- Muggle?
- What you call me?
What you call me?

34:57.496 --> 34:59.798
I called you a fucking muggle.
You're breaking
the very thing that you--

34:59.898 --> 35:01.433
Muggle is
a very serious man.

35:01.533 --> 35:02.768
Don't even believe in wizards.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.069
Look at
the fucking label!

35:04.170 --> 35:05.703
Would you
shut the fuck up?

35:05.704 --> 35:07.406
Are you trying
to never get laid?

35:07.506 --> 35:09.207
There are weapons.
I know there are weapons.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.909
No weapons.

35:11.009 --> 35:13.445
Thinking we tell 'em
we're here to kill ISIS?

35:13.545 --> 35:15.080
At least we'll be
on the same side.

35:15.181 --> 35:16.648
Maybe keep that to yourself.

35:17.082 --> 35:19.218
[in Pashto]

35:38.970 --> 35:41.906
[shouting in Pashto]

35:41.907 --> 35:44.310
Apologies.
You may continue on your way.

35:44.410 --> 35:45.644
Bashir?

35:45.744 --> 35:47.313
We appreciate the kindness.

35:47.413 --> 35:49.448
In an emergency only,
call this number.

35:49.548 --> 35:50.915
Can't promise to help.

35:50.916 --> 35:52.518
Hopefully we won't need it.

35:52.618 --> 35:53.952
May Allah be with you.

35:54.052 --> 35:55.153
And with you.

36:04.563 --> 36:05.997
You reach for an insult,

36:06.097 --> 36:07.766
and you pull out Harry Potter.

36:08.434 --> 36:09.635
Magnificent.

36:53.178 --> 36:54.580
Jail.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.848
Yeah. Looks like it.

36:56.948 --> 36:59.518
Cleric.
Sheik al-Shimali. Jail.

36:59.618 --> 37:01.019
So that's where
they're keeping him.

37:01.119 --> 37:02.488
Do not pass go.

37:03.289 --> 37:04.890
Now Monopoly, Malik.

37:05.691 --> 37:07.325
Abbas always beats me.

37:07.326 --> 37:08.727
He cheats.

37:08.827 --> 37:11.730
I cheat too,
but he cheats better.

37:13.399 --> 37:15.734
So many reasons
to look up to him.

37:20.706 --> 37:22.073
[door opens]

37:25.977 --> 37:27.879
[in Pashto]

37:37.689 --> 37:38.857
[speaking in Pashto]

37:41.327 --> 37:43.362
[door closes]
I'll do anything you want.

37:44.062 --> 37:45.130
Then have coffee.

37:45.697 --> 37:47.265
What?
Sit.

37:50.602 --> 37:54.204
We have had no response
from our offer to release you
and your friends.

37:54.205 --> 37:57.943
Other than the American
is trying to kill us,
of course. [chuckles]

37:58.043 --> 38:00.245
But, you know, that
didn't work well for them.

38:00.346 --> 38:01.913
No, that wasn't my fault.
No, no, no.

38:02.013 --> 38:04.282
None of this
is your fault, I know.

38:05.283 --> 38:06.585
Sip.

38:08.887 --> 38:11.490
I have decided that we need
to show good faith.

38:13.091 --> 38:14.660
So I'm let you go.
You what?

38:14.760 --> 38:16.962
I'm letting you go free.

38:17.062 --> 38:19.130
Me?
You're surprised.

38:19.230 --> 38:21.099
I understand that.

38:21.199 --> 38:23.268
Based on what your media
is trying to paint us.

38:23.369 --> 38:25.337
You threw my friends
off the roof.

38:25.437 --> 38:27.973
Yes, it was a monstrous act.

38:29.207 --> 38:31.777
But, you know,
we have our cause

38:31.877 --> 38:33.744
and we believe strongly
in that cause.

38:33.745 --> 38:35.245
The American
believe in theirs.

38:35.246 --> 38:37.849
And they killed
so many of us.

38:37.949 --> 38:42.087
Our families, our childrens,
with their drones and bombs.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.656
Since before you were born.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.926
My family as well.

38:50.228 --> 38:51.630
I had two girls.

38:53.499 --> 38:55.000
And a wife.

38:56.167 --> 38:58.770
You know, I'm not going to try
to convince you.

39:00.606 --> 39:03.141
- Should I pick someone else?
- No, no.

39:03.241 --> 39:04.810
No. I'll go.

39:06.077 --> 39:07.178
Good.

39:12.017 --> 39:13.685
I want you
to deliver this note

39:14.420 --> 39:15.687
to the police station.

39:15.787 --> 39:17.623
The Taliban police?
Yes.

39:18.123 --> 39:19.357
Tell me.

39:20.759 --> 39:22.561
Can I trust you to do that?

39:24.996 --> 39:26.665
Yes.

39:26.765 --> 39:27.866
You can.

39:28.534 --> 39:29.668
Thank you.

39:30.502 --> 39:31.703
Finish your coffee.

39:31.803 --> 39:33.204
That's okay.

39:33.304 --> 39:35.574
I know.
It's bitter as hell.

39:36.174 --> 39:37.743
[chuckles]

39:57.763 --> 40:00.231
[chattering]

40:36.735 --> 40:38.770
[starter grinding]

40:40.205 --> 40:42.974
[arguing in Pashto]

40:53.685 --> 40:56.321
They want us all to leave
in the other truck
as soon as we are unloaded.

40:56.421 --> 40:59.424
- It's not good.
- No. Abbas will fix.

41:00.125 --> 41:01.259
Okay.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.261
That's what okay looks like?

41:03.361 --> 41:04.763
Yes.

41:04.863 --> 41:06.230
I paid them,
the rest is show.

41:06.231 --> 41:08.934
- That's some show.
- Yeah.

41:09.034 --> 41:10.135
You see behind, boss?

41:12.137 --> 41:13.237
See the humby?

41:13.238 --> 41:14.640
I see the Humvee.

41:14.740 --> 41:16.675
Yes, humby.
Look where it drives.

41:17.909 --> 41:19.409
Where they keep the big guns.

41:19.410 --> 41:21.179
The armory.
[Abbas] No, no.

41:21.279 --> 41:23.615
Guns, bombs,
shit goes boom.

41:23.715 --> 41:26.117
Thanks, Abbas.
We got it covered.

41:26.217 --> 41:27.853
No problem, always.

41:28.319 --> 41:29.621
Malik.

41:32.624 --> 41:34.926
Shit goes boom.
[chuckles]

41:52.177 --> 41:53.178
[knocks]

41:53.278 --> 41:55.480
Rachel, Theresa, headscarves.

41:55.581 --> 41:57.148
Let's go grab some toys.

41:59.117 --> 42:00.117
It's The Bomb.

42:00.118 --> 42:01.186
What is?

42:01.286 --> 42:02.520
I am.

42:02.621 --> 42:03.855
Shooter.

[sirens wailing in distance]

42:57.042 --> 42:58.508
[panting]

42:58.509 --> 43:00.612
Aim a gun.
Pull the trigger.

43:00.712 --> 43:02.080
Next time.

43:03.148 --> 43:05.050
Fuck you
for coming back.

43:06.184 --> 43:07.919
Fuck you
for still being here.

43:11.356 --> 43:12.791
I fight for my home.

43:12.891 --> 43:14.425
Just not very well.

43:18.563 --> 43:19.965
Where are they?

43:35.280 --> 43:37.482
[dogs barking in distance]

43:46.391 --> 43:47.492
Fuck.

43:48.894 --> 43:50.328
[The Bomb]
So it's under there?

43:50.428 --> 43:51.930
Fuck!

43:52.030 --> 43:53.799
Thought a satellite's
been keeping an eye on it.

43:58.036 --> 44:00.638
[The Bomb] Guess a flat roof
looks like a flat roof
from outer space.

44:00.739 --> 44:02.841
- [Shooter] Orbit.
- What?

44:02.941 --> 44:05.143
Satellites are in orbit,
not outer space.

44:06.111 --> 44:07.445
Then that explains it.

44:10.782 --> 44:11.917
Fuck!

44:26.331 --> 44:27.498
Got me some wheels.

44:27.598 --> 44:28.867
Steal it?

44:28.967 --> 44:30.301
Borrowed it.

44:30.401 --> 44:31.636
Borrowed it?

44:31.737 --> 44:33.538
Should've stolen
a bulldozer.

44:38.176 --> 44:41.446
Got you this.
Black market. Fifty bucks.

44:44.983 --> 44:46.117
Beauty.

45:10.308 --> 45:11.242
Go!

45:28.293 --> 45:29.995
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

45:31.062 --> 45:32.831
I was told to give you this.

45:41.006 --> 45:45.877
"This you get for betraying
your faith and your cause."

45:59.891 --> 46:02.393
[explosion]
[car alarms blaring]

46:02.928 --> 46:04.062
What the fuck is that?

46:05.230 --> 46:07.065
[The Bomb]
About five keys of C-4.

46:07.165 --> 46:09.033
ISIS.

46:09.034 --> 46:12.036
No one in the world
seems to notice
there's a civil war here.

46:12.037 --> 46:13.704
Malik. Malik.

46:15.440 --> 46:16.741
Malik will check, boss.

46:20.011 --> 46:23.748
Miss Rabbit, you okay?
I go check.

46:24.883 --> 46:26.151
[door opens]

46:28.519 --> 46:29.821
[door closes]

46:32.958 --> 46:34.325
Doc, you mind?

46:34.425 --> 46:35.626
It's what I do.

46:38.029 --> 46:40.064
All right.
Easy stuff first.
[door closes]

46:40.065 --> 46:41.933
Satellite data
places the hostages here.

46:42.033 --> 46:44.302
And we're still loving
the satellite confirmation?

46:44.402 --> 46:46.904
[Travis] Farmhouse.
Twenty klicks south.
Confirmed by two sources.

46:46.905 --> 46:47.906
They're wrong.

46:49.107 --> 46:51.276
They're at
an abandoned tobacco factory.

46:51.376 --> 46:52.978
Those are the coordinates.

46:53.611 --> 46:54.912
And you know this how?

46:54.913 --> 46:56.948
[panting]
Source is a midwife.

46:57.048 --> 46:59.817
A small circle here,
and midwives talk.

46:59.918 --> 47:02.252
One of Amir's women
gave birth two days ago.

47:02.253 --> 47:03.821
And your source was there?

47:04.422 --> 47:05.823
She wasn't.

47:05.924 --> 47:08.159
But her friend told her
the American girls were.

47:08.259 --> 47:10.128
Just out in the yard
doing yoga?

47:11.963 --> 47:13.164
In a cage.

47:13.264 --> 47:15.200
One of them
had a bad cut on her arm.

47:15.300 --> 47:17.969
And the midwife was asked
to clean the wound.

47:18.069 --> 47:19.337
And we trust this source?

47:21.839 --> 47:23.108
She's Taliban.

47:23.841 --> 47:25.442
I saved her life.

47:25.443 --> 47:27.712
ISIS was closing in on us.

47:28.579 --> 47:30.381
I got her out.

47:30.481 --> 47:32.449
She would have been
beheaded on the spot
for cooperating with us.

47:32.450 --> 47:34.886
Unlike the rest of your unit
that was hacked to pieces.

47:34.986 --> 47:36.054
[Travis] That's enough.

47:36.154 --> 47:38.622
We stow this shit right now,

47:38.623 --> 47:41.659
we start acting like a team,
or we fucking die.

47:43.161 --> 47:44.963
You believe her?
[Jake] I do.

47:45.931 --> 47:47.032
Yours is a trap.

47:47.865 --> 47:49.334
And she's willing
to come with us.

47:49.434 --> 47:51.402
That says it all to me.

47:52.437 --> 47:53.838
Okay.

47:54.805 --> 47:56.541
So weapons.

47:56.641 --> 47:57.742
The stash?

47:58.309 --> 47:59.410
Sensitive subject.

47:59.510 --> 48:00.845
[siren wailing]

48:03.314 --> 48:05.649
Abbas,
we're taking your armory.

48:05.650 --> 48:08.086
Smart, boss. Let's do it.

48:08.186 --> 48:10.521
- Seriously?
- [Travis] We use
what's been given to us.

48:10.621 --> 48:13.091
Rocky,
we can't use the NGO car.

48:13.191 --> 48:14.926
I need you to steal me
another one.

48:18.729 --> 48:20.898
[door opens, closes]

48:20.999 --> 48:24.202
So, we're taking the base
with some Molotov cocktails

48:24.302 --> 48:26.504
and a rifle from World War I.

Abbas, Humvee.
Everybody else
grab what we need.

[grunts]

52:01.719 --> 52:02.887
Yes!

52:16.901 --> 52:18.336
Stop, go back!

52:18.436 --> 52:20.237
Sorry, Miss.
Go back!

52:20.238 --> 52:22.440
We're not leaving him!
Go back!

52:22.540 --> 52:24.275
Can't.

52:24.375 --> 52:26.311
You know what
they're gonna do
with the body.

52:26.411 --> 52:28.179
If that was Abbas,
would you leave him?

52:29.947 --> 52:31.081
Would you?

53:02.413 --> 53:04.482

53:41.452 --> 53:42.720
Bring them home.

53:44.322 --> 53:45.890
Fuck you.
You're gonna be fine.

53:54.765 --> 53:56.901

[engine running]

54:53.891 --> 54:55.460

55:02.199 --> 55:04.568
I'm calling that number
in two minutes.

55:04.569 --> 55:06.471
I need you to trace
the location.

55:08.305 --> 55:09.474
[grunts]

55:10.240 --> 55:11.776
What the fuck was that?

55:13.578 --> 55:15.980
We don't leave men behind.

55:16.080 --> 55:17.782
No, you get them killed.

55:17.882 --> 55:20.117
You wanna make up
for abandoning your men?

55:20.217 --> 55:21.986
Do it at
someone else's expense.

55:25.456 --> 55:27.591
Right now,
they don't know who we are.

55:27.592 --> 55:31.161
But if they find an American
with Doc's ID, they will.

55:31.261 --> 55:33.430
And we'll have no way out.

55:33.431 --> 55:35.966
Hey, I'm connected,
and we're online.

55:36.066 --> 55:37.702
That's why
you went back?

55:39.169 --> 55:40.605
No.

55:45.376 --> 55:46.877
[Bashir] <i>Hello?</i>

55:46.977 --> 55:48.513
We need what you offered.

55:48.646 --> 55:50.214
[Bashir]
<i>Half the city's on fire.</i>

55:50.347 --> 55:52.082
<i>The police
are searching for you.</i>

55:52.182 --> 55:54.318
[Jake] For us?
<i>I don't know.
Some say it was ISIS.</i>

55:55.620 --> 55:57.087
It wasn't.

55:57.187 --> 55:58.656
[Bashir]
<i>That doesn't matter now.</i>

55:58.789 --> 55:59.924
<i>They'll find you.
I can't help you.</i>

56:00.024 --> 56:02.192
Bashir, wait. Just listen.

56:02.292 --> 56:03.494
<i>Listen to what?</i>

56:05.229 --> 56:06.697
We'll see you soon.
<i>See me?</i>

56:06.797 --> 56:08.566
We're close. Five miles.

56:08.666 --> 56:12.069
Driving in that?
We won't make it a mile.

56:18.008 --> 56:20.711
Geek. Let's go.

56:39.830 --> 56:41.432
[engine approaching]

56:49.173 --> 56:51.340
You cannot stay here.
You have to go.

56:51.341 --> 56:53.010
But we have no choice.

56:53.878 --> 56:55.580
We need somewhere
to bury our dead.

56:57.882 --> 56:59.249
[sighs]

58:03.814 --> 58:04.949
Miss Rabbit.

58:07.317 --> 58:08.452
Miss Rabbit.

58:11.221 --> 58:12.356
Miss Rabbit!

58:14.625 --> 58:15.760
It's deep enough.

58:44.188 --> 58:45.723
[sighs]

58:45.823 --> 58:47.692
- [door closes]
- [Camila]
This won't take long.

58:49.293 --> 58:51.461
[chattering, indistinct]

59:03.874 --> 59:06.310
- You called her?
- Of course.

59:07.812 --> 59:09.513
How did you get in
the country?

59:10.715 --> 59:12.717
He tells me
two of your men are dead.

59:12.817 --> 59:15.018
I'm very sorry to hear it.

59:15.019 --> 59:18.923
The news says
it was an ISIS attack.
Same as the police station.

59:19.023 --> 59:22.526
One of the girls from
the school was found there.

59:22.627 --> 59:25.495
At least her uniform
and parts of her.

59:26.563 --> 59:27.698
Caucasian.

59:29.033 --> 59:31.368
I was wrong about
who would be first to die.

59:31.468 --> 59:34.238
But I don't think
I will be wrong
about the second.

59:37.742 --> 59:39.043
Ten million.

59:40.010 --> 59:41.712
You heard what Travis said.

59:41.812 --> 59:43.914
Travis is dead,
so who's in charge?

59:48.385 --> 59:50.254
Then it's your decision.

59:50.354 --> 59:51.856
All thousands?

59:53.658 --> 59:55.025
Thousand-dollar bills?

59:56.093 --> 59:58.395
I didn't know there were
that many in circulation.

59:58.495 --> 01:00:00.097
Where'd you find
ten million in thousands?

01:00:00.197 --> 01:00:01.565
She didn't.

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:04.635
They're counterfeit.

01:00:04.735 --> 01:00:07.271
You want us to pay a ransom
in counterfeit bills?

01:00:07.371 --> 01:00:09.807
It's all I could get.
They shouldn't notice.

01:00:09.907 --> 01:00:11.241
Took her less than a minute.

01:00:11.341 --> 01:00:13.744
Amir is not American.
It will give you time.

01:00:13.844 --> 01:00:15.980
This just gets better
and better.

01:00:16.080 --> 01:00:19.483
Your rescue failed.
What choice do you have?

01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:22.886
Save one girl.
America will pay for the rest.

01:00:22.887 --> 01:00:25.155
Then you can escape.

01:00:25.255 --> 01:00:27.557
I assume that's why
you're here, to escape?

01:00:32.262 --> 01:00:34.398
Do one good thing
before you go.

01:00:42.472 --> 01:00:43.907
Do we even have a way out?

01:00:43.908 --> 01:00:46.110
I have a number
to call for evacuation.

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:47.778
Black Hawk sitting hot
across the border.

01:00:47.878 --> 01:00:49.413
So call it.

01:00:53.417 --> 01:00:55.820
All cell phones
on the table.

01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.655
If the news is fake,
they could be trying
to track us.

01:00:58.756 --> 01:01:00.624
I'm keeping mine off.

01:01:01.792 --> 01:01:03.761
Pull the SIMs.
Smash everything good.

01:01:05.930 --> 01:01:07.464
Fuck you!
No!

01:01:17.141 --> 01:01:18.275
[door opens]

01:01:19.343 --> 01:01:20.778
You admire women?
[door closes]

01:01:21.645 --> 01:01:23.480
That why you threw them
off the roof?

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:26.851
Where is Halle?

01:01:26.951 --> 01:01:28.518
I promised
to let her go.

01:01:29.086 --> 01:01:30.287
And I did.

01:01:30.654 --> 01:01:31.956
Right.

01:01:33.123 --> 01:01:34.658
I hear we are moving.

01:01:35.492 --> 01:01:37.027
Americans coming, are they?

01:01:37.127 --> 01:01:38.695
The guards like to talk.

01:01:38.796 --> 01:01:40.731
If I was afraid
of the American,

01:01:40.831 --> 01:01:43.000
I wouldn't make plans
to marry you.

01:01:44.869 --> 01:01:46.503
[chuckling] Marry me?

01:01:46.603 --> 01:01:48.806
We just need to wait
for the cleric.

01:01:51.308 --> 01:01:52.877
You are out of
your fucking mind.

01:01:52.977 --> 01:01:56.713
I decided
I need a strong woman

01:01:56.814 --> 01:01:58.749
to give me childrens
who are fighters.

01:01:58.849 --> 01:02:02.486
Because weak women
make weak childrens.

01:02:03.287 --> 01:02:06.489
I would rather die
than marry you.

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:08.993
That's going to be
exact your choice.

01:02:10.127 --> 01:02:13.197
But, by marrying me,

01:02:14.298 --> 01:02:16.566
you will save
the lives of your friends.

01:02:19.536 --> 01:02:21.105
You'll let them go?
No.

01:02:21.205 --> 01:02:24.208
I will marry them
to my most loyal fighters.

01:02:25.342 --> 01:02:26.443
They deserve the reward.

01:02:26.543 --> 01:02:28.344
Better than being sold
to slavery,

01:02:28.345 --> 01:02:30.714
where they will be
treated differently.

01:02:32.216 --> 01:02:35.052
I won't marry you
without your consent.

01:02:49.066 --> 01:02:50.267
[Shooter whistles]

01:02:51.735 --> 01:02:52.970
Car approaching!

01:03:06.450 --> 01:03:08.052
You invited guests?

01:03:25.102 --> 01:03:26.236
Hello.

01:03:26.904 --> 01:03:28.305
I'm Taliban.

01:03:28.405 --> 01:03:29.773
Nice to meet you.

01:03:31.641 --> 01:03:33.910
The Taliban think it's ISIS.

01:03:33.911 --> 01:03:35.479
You mustn't have left
witnesses.

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.414
But Amir knows it wasn't.

01:03:38.415 --> 01:03:41.118
My friend heard
they're moving the girls.
She doesn't know where.

01:03:41.218 --> 01:03:44.253
Beautiful. No leader,
no weapons, and no target.

01:03:44.254 --> 01:03:45.990
We have weapons, some.

01:03:46.090 --> 01:03:48.025
They think ISIS
stole the weapons
to attack the prison.

01:03:48.125 --> 01:03:49.425
So they're moving the sheik.

01:03:49.426 --> 01:03:51.028
When?
[Awina] Soon.

01:03:51.128 --> 01:03:53.930
- Where?
- To the only
near maximum security prison.

01:03:53.931 --> 01:03:55.532
America built it.

01:03:55.632 --> 01:03:57.534
What was the stupidest plan
you came up with?

01:03:57.634 --> 01:04:00.269
- Nothing could have
topped that one.
- What was it? Come on!

01:04:00.270 --> 01:04:02.472
Break the sheik
out of prison and trade him.

01:04:03.340 --> 01:04:05.675
Amir wants money
and the sheik.

01:04:05.775 --> 01:04:07.110
We have the money.

01:04:07.111 --> 01:04:08.444
Let's get the sheik.

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:10.479
And make Amir come to us.

01:04:10.480 --> 01:04:12.016
I always liked this plan.

01:04:12.116 --> 01:04:13.950
He's going to be
very heavily guarded.

01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:16.020
Yeah. I need your phone.

01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:17.955
I wasn't dumb enough
to bring it.

01:04:19.756 --> 01:04:21.525
Burn all our fake ID.

01:04:23.027 --> 01:04:24.328
If anyone is caught,

01:04:24.428 --> 01:04:26.663
just admit
you're an American soldier.

01:04:26.763 --> 01:04:29.166
Won't be pleasant, but
you'll eventually be traded.

01:04:29.666 --> 01:04:30.901
Got it?

01:04:31.001 --> 01:04:32.136
You weren't.

01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:36.306
No. But it's
the best chance we have.

01:04:49.819 --> 01:04:51.421

01:05:21.485 --> 01:05:22.851
So how will they know?

01:05:22.852 --> 01:05:24.354
When they see us.

01:05:25.222 --> 01:05:26.923
Well, I hope to God
they're ready.

01:05:47.611 --> 01:05:49.746
[shouting in Pashto]

01:06:00.557 --> 01:06:01.958
She's coming.

01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:52.602
Get into the car.

01:07:52.702 --> 01:07:54.171
What?
Go!

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:57.174
I'm sorry, Rocky. I'm sorry.

01:07:58.875 --> 01:08:01.044
[Rocky strains, screams]

01:08:01.978 --> 01:08:03.613
[gunfire]

01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:07.217
Tell them
you're an American soldier.

01:08:07.317 --> 01:08:09.886
[panting] I am.

01:08:09.986 --> 01:08:11.388
Fucking right you are.

01:08:11.755 --> 01:08:13.056
Tell them.

01:08:20.930 --> 01:08:22.566
Abbas. [shouts in Pashto]

01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:26.870
Open up!

01:08:27.371 --> 01:08:28.572
Get in.

01:08:30.106 --> 01:08:31.074
Go!

01:08:47.056 --> 01:08:48.158
Abbas!

01:08:51.728 --> 01:08:53.062
[sobbing] Abbas.

01:09:14.818 --> 01:09:17.687
What he did worst,
he loved most.

01:09:18.622 --> 01:09:19.623
Singing?

01:09:19.723 --> 01:09:20.756
No.

01:09:20.757 --> 01:09:22.326
Singing was good.

01:09:23.293 --> 01:09:24.761
He loved driving.

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:27.331
That he did.

01:09:29.433 --> 01:09:31.335
For you,
freedom is America.

01:09:32.602 --> 01:09:34.170
For him,
it was just driving.

01:09:50.186 --> 01:09:52.522
[footsteps approaching]

01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:05.068
You wanna talk about it?

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:07.704
What?

01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:12.376
Not really.

01:10:22.118 --> 01:10:25.088
You start out
pretty early in life
knowing there is a...

01:10:26.856 --> 01:10:29.759
a line you won't cross.

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:31.895
Things you'll do,
things you'll never do.

01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:36.366
You get into a tough spot,
the line shifts.

01:10:36.466 --> 01:10:38.668
You get in the real shit,
it shifts more.

01:10:41.738 --> 01:10:43.607
I will never eat a cat.

01:10:45.475 --> 01:10:47.510
Wait till you're starving
to death and they serve you

01:10:47.511 --> 01:10:49.613
the stray kitty
you've been petting.

01:10:52.081 --> 01:10:54.117
But there is still a line.

01:10:54.217 --> 01:10:57.020
Thick, dark and straight,
and the line holds.

01:11:00.089 --> 01:11:05.193
Till you find yourself
in a place
where the line just ends.

01:11:05.194 --> 01:11:09.699
Gone.
Every choice is unthinkable.

01:11:13.537 --> 01:11:16.373
Frank, our team leader,

01:11:17.841 --> 01:11:19.708
he held us together
for months in that hole.

01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:21.578
Every single one of us
loved him.

01:11:25.749 --> 01:11:28.884
He was about to die
a horrible death. Slow.

01:11:28.885 --> 01:11:32.389
His bones breaking
rock by rock,
thrown by his own men.

01:11:34.290 --> 01:11:36.159
They stood us in a circle.

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:38.395
We all refused.

01:11:39.396 --> 01:11:42.165
So Amir sliced the throat
of a village woman.

01:11:42.265 --> 01:11:44.801
Let her bleed out,
kicking on the dirt.

01:11:45.702 --> 01:11:47.604
We still refused.

01:11:47.704 --> 01:11:49.573
He did the same to her kid.

01:11:53.577 --> 01:11:56.913
I was his second.
It was on me.

01:12:00.984 --> 01:12:03.453
So I picked up
a nice round rock,

01:12:04.087 --> 01:12:05.689
weighed it in my hand.

01:12:06.623 --> 01:12:08.591
And Frank
looked me right in the eye.

01:12:08.592 --> 01:12:11.828
Gave me this little smile.

01:12:13.463 --> 01:12:16.165
He'd seen me pitch
back at the base
when we played pickup.

01:12:18.234 --> 01:12:20.770
He turned his head
so that his temple was to me.

01:12:23.773 --> 01:12:27.943
And I wound up and I hurled
the fastest pitch I ever threw.

01:12:27.944 --> 01:12:30.179
I swear
I heard his skull crack.

01:12:35.151 --> 01:12:36.786
Just took the one rock.

01:12:40.590 --> 01:12:44.060
You do something like that,
you never find the line again.

01:12:47.964 --> 01:12:52.502
And that smile
haunts me every night.

01:12:56.873 --> 01:12:59.375
I thought I'd never
leave anyone else behind.

01:12:59.476 --> 01:13:01.010
[Geek] She's on the TV!

01:13:02.779 --> 01:13:04.881

01:13:11.187 --> 01:13:12.756
What?

01:13:12.856 --> 01:13:15.492
He says
she's an abomination,
not man or woman.

01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.194
Fuck you!

01:13:21.565 --> 01:13:22.566
What?

01:13:22.666 --> 01:13:24.166
And that she's ISIS.

01:13:24.167 --> 01:13:26.168
- They saw us right?
- [Jake] They saw us.

01:13:26.169 --> 01:13:28.705
[Bashir]
Because only ISIS would accept
a woman that is so degenerate.

01:13:28.805 --> 01:13:32.408
- This is bullshit!
- Come on, Rocky.
Speak English.

01:13:32.509 --> 01:13:35.343
[Bashir] And that she
and others have killed
many brave Taliban soldiers.

01:13:35.344 --> 01:13:36.613
Tell them.

01:13:39.015 --> 01:13:42.051
Now he's asking
if she has anything
to say in her defense.

01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:43.386
She won't.
She will.

01:13:43.487 --> 01:13:44.853
She'll tell them
she's American.

01:13:44.854 --> 01:13:47.022
- She promised me.
- She won't give us up.

01:13:47.023 --> 01:13:49.058
Our cover's already
been blown, they know it's us.
She knows that.

01:13:49.158 --> 01:13:50.126
She won't.

01:13:52.195 --> 01:13:53.597
Please, Rocky!

and his kindness.

- Is she dead?
- Unconscious.

01:14:59.763 --> 01:15:01.164
What the fuck?
You saved her life.

01:15:01.264 --> 01:15:03.833
I only thought I did.
[spits]

01:15:03.933 --> 01:15:07.103
She brought them to us then,
and she's bringing them
to us now.

01:15:07.604 --> 01:15:08.938
What?

01:15:09.939 --> 01:15:13.009
Fuck. She's been
updating them the entire time.

01:15:13.109 --> 01:15:15.178
How long do we have?
Minutes.

01:15:15.745 --> 01:15:16.846
Give me the phone.

01:15:17.814 --> 01:15:19.182
Get the cars on the road.

01:15:19.282 --> 01:15:20.349
Bring me the money.

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:21.885
It's in the car.
Bring it.

01:15:21.985 --> 01:15:23.019
Leave it here.

01:15:23.119 --> 01:15:25.287
What about them?
We leave them.

01:15:25.288 --> 01:15:26.522
You're giving them
everything--

01:15:26.623 --> 01:15:28.191

Go where?

01:17:17.366 --> 01:17:19.102
To find my phone.

01:17:19.202 --> 01:17:21.270
I love Find My Phone.
Where is it?

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:22.806
