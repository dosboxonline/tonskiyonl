01:54.314 --> 01:56.182
How long
have you felt like this?

01:57.417 --> 01:58.618
Kay?

02:01.754 --> 02:03.523
Whoa!

02:03.623 --> 02:06.025
Whoa, you're getting so big.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.529
Kay and I were just having
a little morning session,
if you don't mind.

02:09.629 --> 02:11.764
Since when
do you give Kay sessions?

02:11.831 --> 02:14.868
I just said my feet hurt. See?

02:14.968 --> 02:17.370
- Oof!

02:17.470 --> 02:21.674
Well, you know,
Driller Bill has some
killer unicorn Band-Aids.

02:21.774 --> 02:23.943
I don't want Band-Aids.
I want new shoes.

02:24.010 --> 02:27.447
And we were discussing
whether or not that
was a good idea.

02:27.514 --> 02:29.549
What's the big deal?
I'll just go pick some up.

02:30.617 --> 02:31.818
What if I go?

02:32.886 --> 02:34.621
I don't know
what size I am now.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.457
I need to try them on myself.

02:39.058 --> 02:40.660
You want to go up?

02:40.727 --> 02:46.299
But as I was explaining to Kay,
there are rules in place.

02:46.366 --> 02:50.036
The Underground is
a delicate ecosystem,

02:50.136 --> 02:52.805
and brash decisions
affect us all.

02:53.406 --> 02:55.375
Brash decisions?

02:55.475 --> 02:59.479
This is her body.
Everything here is hers.

02:59.546 --> 03:01.181
So if she wants to
go up, then...

03:01.247 --> 03:02.515
She's a little girl,

03:02.582 --> 03:04.717
and she cannot make
these decisions alone.

03:04.817 --> 03:06.920
And she won't,
because I'm here.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.024
You don't have the right.

03:11.090 --> 03:13.760
Hey.

03:15.528 --> 03:20.266
God! Do you get off on
being a cranky old bitch?

03:20.366 --> 03:22.735
Kay wants to go up.
I think that's a good thing.

03:24.871 --> 03:25.838
Is it?

03:26.906 --> 03:28.208
Fuck off.

03:28.274 --> 03:32.612
We all ate a piece of it, Jane.
We're all a part of this.

03:32.712 --> 03:36.616
Whatever decisions
need to be made,
and whatever happens,

03:36.716 --> 03:39.619
we are all a part of it.

03:51.064 --> 03:55.034
How goddamn cute
is that?

03:56.769 --> 03:59.439
Check it out.

03:59.539 --> 04:02.976
The Steele family biceps
coming in already!

04:03.076 --> 04:05.378
He's going to be
one hell of a pitcher.

04:05.445 --> 04:07.313
Or whatever he wants to be.

04:07.413 --> 04:09.482
No pressure, only support.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.652
L-M-F-A-O.

04:13.720 --> 04:14.754
Do you even know
what that means?

04:14.821 --> 04:17.257
Yeah. Love my fucking
awesome offspring.

04:17.323 --> 04:18.257
What?

04:19.492 --> 04:20.760
Where did you
get these exactly?

04:20.827 --> 04:22.395
World Wide Web, baby.

04:22.462 --> 04:23.963
You want it? They got it.

04:25.665 --> 04:26.599
Ooh!

04:28.101 --> 04:30.503
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.
Rule number one
of the Internet.

04:30.603 --> 04:31.671
Don't click pop-ups.

04:31.771 --> 04:33.072
- But I wa...
- Hey.

04:34.140 --> 04:37.010
- Pay attention.

04:37.110 --> 04:42.181
Okay, um, recommended dosage,
take two capsules.

04:44.284 --> 04:48.187
Check. Take with food. Check.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.024
It says here that you should
start to see improvement
in a couple of months.

04:51.124 --> 04:52.458
Couple months?

04:57.597 --> 04:58.831
What the hell?

05:01.934 --> 05:05.872
Booyah. Be right back.

05:21.487 --> 05:25.892
"May take up to
two to three months
to become effective."

05:27.827 --> 05:29.062
Three whole months?

05:54.053 --> 05:57.090
Ha!
Eat shit, Parkinson's.

05:58.057 --> 05:59.692
I don't get it.

05:59.759 --> 06:00.860
<i>I didn't like
the thought of my son
running around</i>

06:00.927 --> 06:02.395
<i>without any way to
protect himself.</i>

06:02.495 --> 06:04.063
What about S.T.A.R. Labs?

06:04.163 --> 06:05.998
<i>I've disabled
their tracking
and surveillance protocols.</i>

06:07.867 --> 06:08.901
<i>This is our little secret.</i>

06:10.203 --> 06:11.504
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

06:14.407 --> 06:15.408
Dad?

06:16.876 --> 06:18.511
<i>I'm sorry, Vic.</i>

06:18.578 --> 06:21.848
<i>Obviously, that word
has been lacking
in my vocabulary,</i>

06:21.914 --> 06:24.584
<i>but I'm saying it now,
and I mean it.</i>

06:24.684 --> 06:26.953
<i>I never wanted to be
the kind of dad</i>

06:27.053 --> 06:30.356
<i>who pushes his son down
some preconceived path.</i>

06:30.423 --> 06:34.060
<i>Maybe turning
into one's own father
is an unavoidable tragedy.</i>

06:35.027 --> 06:36.896
Great.

06:37.764 --> 06:39.732
Hey, now.

06:43.202 --> 06:46.773
<i>Cyborg was never meant to be
a means to reinvent you.</i>

06:50.376 --> 06:51.744
I know.

06:51.811 --> 06:54.480
<i>Vic, if this is something
you don't want anymore...</i>

06:54.580 --> 06:56.416
That's not what I'm saying.

06:56.482 --> 06:58.418
I appreciate
what you're doing for me.

06:59.585 --> 07:00.620
And what you did.

07:07.293 --> 07:11.464
<i>Um... Sorry, I gotta take this.</i>

07:11.564 --> 07:14.901
<i>We can talk more soon,
if you want.</i>

07:14.967 --> 07:16.335
You know where to find me.

07:34.787 --> 07:38.124
It's gone,
without a trace.

07:38.191 --> 07:39.525
You sure?
Trust me.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.528
I can spot a clogged pore
upstage left from a mezzanine.

07:43.996 --> 07:45.031
Hmm.

07:47.867 --> 07:49.702
Maybe it was all part of
the zombie thing.

07:49.802 --> 07:52.038
Please, no more talk of
the Z-word,

07:52.138 --> 07:55.942
or anything pertaining
to that day in question,
thank you.

07:56.008 --> 07:57.643
Sorry. Sorry.

07:57.710 --> 08:01.514
I'd do
well enough never to hear
the word "brain" again either.

08:03.382 --> 08:05.051
Nevertheless...

08:05.151 --> 08:08.521
I suppose this means
you aren't dying.

08:13.693 --> 08:14.894
Huh?

08:14.994 --> 08:17.630
- What?
- Oh, it's just...

08:19.632 --> 08:20.900
Uh...

08:22.034 --> 08:23.369
What? Oh, my God!

08:23.469 --> 08:24.871
- Don't panic.
- Don't panic?

08:24.971 --> 08:27.874
Well, clearly,
it's not a tumor,
because tumors don't move.

08:27.974 --> 08:30.676
There is a thing
underneath my skin,

08:31.511 --> 08:33.412
running around my body.

08:34.914 --> 08:36.015
- Oh.

08:36.082 --> 08:37.683
Team meeting,
three minutes.

08:38.584 --> 08:40.987
- What?
- Three minutes!

08:42.188 --> 08:43.189
Okay.

08:44.423 --> 08:45.591
Hey!

08:46.526 --> 08:48.561
You can't call team meeting.

08:48.661 --> 08:50.396
You're not a team leader.

08:51.330 --> 08:52.832
And we're not even a team!

09:08.047 --> 09:10.249
Hey, Doctor Who.

09:11.684 --> 09:12.885
Did you get us all in here

09:12.952 --> 09:14.520
so we can watch you do
your Kegels,

09:14.587 --> 09:16.355
or did you actually have
something to say?

09:17.790 --> 09:19.692
The next time
you have a question,
young lady,

09:19.759 --> 09:21.761
I suggest you raise
your hand, okay?

09:23.129 --> 09:26.132
The Ant Farm.
Do you recall a jailbreak

09:26.232 --> 09:28.901
your merry band
orchestrated there
some time ago?

09:30.403 --> 09:31.370
Uh, yeah?

09:32.605 --> 09:34.373
- Of course!

09:35.107 --> 09:37.443
That's why I'm here.

09:37.543 --> 09:39.645
- You freed them,

09:39.745 --> 09:42.582
those insidious,
cutthroat terrorists.

09:42.648 --> 09:43.783
Terrorists?

09:44.984 --> 09:47.219
- The Sisterhood of Dada.
- The Sisterhood of what?

09:47.286 --> 09:50.990
These escapees, you want to
find and corral them?

09:51.090 --> 09:55.094
No, actually,
I'd like you to kill them.

09:56.629 --> 09:58.297
We are not the kind of people
that kill people.

09:58.397 --> 10:01.400
Unless they're
Nazis or butts.

10:01.467 --> 10:02.568
Yeah,
and not to mention,

10:02.635 --> 10:04.670
I was a prisoner
of the Ant Farm.

10:04.770 --> 10:07.673
We all were.
And we're not bad people.

10:07.773 --> 10:10.343
What makes you so sure that
the Sisterhood of the Dada are?

10:10.443 --> 10:12.011
What exactly is Dada?

10:12.111 --> 10:15.014
Uh, it's just this
insufferable thing
the French came up with

10:15.114 --> 10:18.351
so they could make
crude nudie films
and call it art.

10:18.451 --> 10:19.685
Really?

10:19.785 --> 10:21.420
I thought it was that thing
where you do bad shit,

10:21.487 --> 10:22.855
the universe does
bad shit to you.

10:22.955 --> 10:25.191
- That's Karma, dick slit.
- Oh.

10:25.291 --> 10:28.761
Exhibit A,
left behind in
one of their cells

10:28.828 --> 10:30.763
after your little jailbreak.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.536
"The eternal
flatulation is coming."

10:44.977 --> 10:47.146
The insignia was also found
in Prague,

10:47.213 --> 10:50.983
Mumbai, Wellington
and Kuala Lumpur,

10:51.050 --> 10:53.319
and dozens of other cities
throughout the globe.

10:53.386 --> 10:55.821
Striking evidence
of a global conspiracy.

10:57.156 --> 11:01.160
Luckily, Jones also
tracked them

11:01.227 --> 11:04.196
to what appears to be
their current location.

11:08.868 --> 11:10.136
They're close.

11:10.202 --> 11:12.672
Why does it say
"join us?"

11:12.738 --> 11:14.407
For what exactly?

11:14.507 --> 11:16.242
Oh, it's probably
nothing, dear.

11:16.342 --> 11:18.811
You know, I'm sure I just
crawled through
the earth currents

11:18.878 --> 11:22.715
of time and space
to simply sit around
drinking weak tea

11:22.815 --> 11:26.719
in a halfway house
for a bunch of
self-loathing layabouts.

11:26.819 --> 11:27.753
Ouch.

11:27.853 --> 11:31.223
Or maybe I came here,

11:31.323 --> 11:34.226
because something very big
and very ugly,

11:34.326 --> 11:38.097
an eternal flagellation,
perhaps, is set to occur,

11:38.197 --> 11:40.533
and it needs to be stopped.

11:40.599 --> 11:45.204
Oh. And you don't want
to do this yourself because?

11:45.271 --> 11:48.674
Uh, they'd spot me
a mile off. Right?

11:48.741 --> 11:49.875
Bird or no bird.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.253
Fine.

12:02.621 --> 12:05.458
If you won't
dirty your little
pacifist hands,

12:05.558 --> 12:09.462
then, all I ask
is for you to observe
and report.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.198
And how do you want us
to do that exactly?

12:12.264 --> 12:17.636
They said, "Join us,"
so, join, infiltrate.

12:19.872 --> 12:20.873
Ahem.

12:23.943 --> 12:24.944
What?

12:25.044 --> 12:27.413
If we do this,
will you go away forever?

12:27.480 --> 12:28.447
Ooh!

12:31.117 --> 12:32.051
Yeah, probab--

12:32.118 --> 12:33.486
Cool.
I'm down.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.421
All right, Rita,
you come with me.

12:38.124 --> 12:39.759
You're not team leader.

12:47.800 --> 12:50.569
Right there,
in the glass cabinet.

12:52.938 --> 12:55.608
- Is that... me?
- Yes.

12:56.509 --> 12:59.011
And why is that you?

12:59.111 --> 13:01.113
I knew it. I knew it!

13:01.180 --> 13:05.351
Rita Farr, world-renowned
time-traveler. It's true!

13:05.451 --> 13:07.920
Uh-huh. So you admit it?

13:07.987 --> 13:10.189
Admit it? I'm overjoyed.

13:11.991 --> 13:15.861
Oh, I thought I was going mad
after I saw myself,

13:15.961 --> 13:18.531
but there's the proof.

13:20.266 --> 13:22.501
Prepare to eat your words,
Larry Trainor.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.940
Yeah, I suppose, but, I...

13:31.811 --> 13:34.113
- Uh...
- Laura?

13:34.880 --> 13:35.815
Hello?

13:43.322 --> 13:45.191
Hang a left up here,
Larry. Now!

13:45.291 --> 13:46.792
I got it. I got it.

13:46.859 --> 13:48.828
Jeez, Vic,
don't get too excited,

13:48.894 --> 13:50.996
or we'll have to get
the bus detailed.

13:55.201 --> 13:57.403
Hey, Van Gogh, what the fuck?

14:00.873 --> 14:03.242
Cliff... you okay?

14:03.342 --> 14:05.077
Whoa.

14:05.177 --> 14:08.914
Is it just me,
or are you extra shiny today?

14:09.014 --> 14:10.382
Man, what the hell?

14:10.482 --> 14:13.586
You know, I was
a little skeptical
about those pills,

14:13.686 --> 14:17.590
but... Whoa!
Look at my hands.

14:17.690 --> 14:21.193
- They're amazing.
- What pills?

14:21.260 --> 14:24.063
They're his new meds.
They're not supposed to...

14:25.865 --> 14:26.899
Cliff, how many did you take?

14:31.670 --> 14:34.907
- You do not want to know.
- What the hell is wrong
with you?

14:35.908 --> 14:37.443
Those are dopamine stimulators.

14:38.577 --> 14:40.045
- Boop.
- Get your hands away from me.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.548
Oh, my God. Larry!

14:43.382 --> 14:44.683
You have a neck zit.

14:44.750 --> 14:47.052
Oh... Oh, my God.

14:47.119 --> 14:48.120
Don't worry, I got it.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.622
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.257
- Cliff, sit down.
- Squish it!

14:51.357 --> 14:53.192
Get away from me.
Get away from me.

14:58.898 --> 15:01.100
Oh, God!

15:06.739 --> 15:08.607
God.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.283
Whoa.

15:18.217 --> 15:21.487
So grey.

15:23.923 --> 15:26.158
This has gotta be
the sisterhood, right?

15:27.993 --> 15:29.295
Grid's lost signal.

15:30.429 --> 15:31.430
But yeah.

15:33.265 --> 15:34.133
Everyone stay close.

15:34.233 --> 15:36.001
Let's go,
motherfuckers!

15:36.101 --> 15:38.103
- Cliff! God damn it.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.275
Great. Awesome.

15:44.476 --> 15:46.645
How does this crap
keep happening to us?

15:46.745 --> 15:49.848
Because no one else
gets sent on a mission

15:49.949 --> 15:53.018
by a time-traveling bird lady
to go hunt down some art freaks

15:53.118 --> 15:55.654
who pissed off a half-man,
half-butt monster

15:55.754 --> 15:57.756
who may be trying to
destroy the world.

15:58.590 --> 15:59.825
Yeah, got it.

15:59.925 --> 16:02.461
Uh, someone should stay
with the bus.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.496
What?

16:04.596 --> 16:07.933
I'm not completely useless
without "it," you know?

16:10.636 --> 16:13.005
But you're right.
Someone should stay
with the bus.

16:14.473 --> 16:16.108
Smell you later, bacne boy.

16:16.642 --> 16:17.543
Hey.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.282
Ow. God.

16:28.354 --> 16:31.991
My mother wasn't exactly
an oracle of clever thought,

16:32.057 --> 16:35.327
but she was wise
about one thing.

16:35.394 --> 16:38.497
There's nothing a martini,
or three can't fix.

16:41.867 --> 16:44.803
Well, sometimes it takes
a couple more than three.

16:44.870 --> 16:47.473
Okay, good.

16:52.511 --> 16:54.513
It's dead, Rita.

16:56.215 --> 16:58.884
My body elephant's deceased.

17:00.352 --> 17:05.057
Cremated under
a burning hearth of doubt.

17:05.157 --> 17:07.593
- Oh, no. Why?
- Why? Why?

17:07.693 --> 17:09.228
Why, indeed, and who and what.

17:10.696 --> 17:11.997
Then, Niles's head...

17:13.332 --> 17:16.435
told me about a letter
he wrote some years ago.

17:18.337 --> 17:19.505
The things he says about me.

17:23.208 --> 17:25.044
- Disloyal.

17:25.110 --> 17:28.280
Conniving. Danger... Oh!

17:29.014 --> 17:31.116
Pish-posh. Ha!

17:31.216 --> 17:35.220
Who knows what drove
that manipulative old insect
to write this?

17:35.287 --> 17:38.690
Okay, look, the others
will be back
before you know it,

17:38.757 --> 17:42.928
and I'm sure
whatever they derive from
the Dada folk will help.

17:43.028 --> 17:45.464
Mmm. Well, yeah, about that.

17:45.564 --> 17:52.538
Um, you know, I have no idea,
what the Sisterhood of Dada
will yield.

17:52.604 --> 17:57.142
Every time I think
I've found another
vital piece of the puzzle,

17:57.242 --> 18:00.312
you know, you, the film,
that letter, it's just...

18:04.550 --> 18:07.719
I can manage the despair of
not knowing my history,

18:07.786 --> 18:09.988
my favorite song,
or my favorite color,

18:10.089 --> 18:13.559
not knowing if I have loved,
or have been loved,

18:14.660 --> 18:19.131
but this
polarizing pool inside...

18:21.100 --> 18:23.469
You know, one moment,
I recall an endless joy...

18:23.569 --> 18:24.670
Hmm.

18:24.770 --> 18:31.276
...and the next, an...
An impenetrable hatred.

18:31.343 --> 18:37.282
Like I could very well be
the woman in that letter.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.754
Ah, here I am, yeah.

18:44.690 --> 18:48.961
Pouring my heart and soul out
like some dizzy old housewife.

18:50.929 --> 18:53.432
To you, of all people.

18:53.499 --> 18:54.533
Oh, I...

18:54.633 --> 18:57.503
Apparently, my name is
Laura De Mille.

18:58.604 --> 19:01.306
Perhaps, I came from
decades ago

19:01.373 --> 19:05.310
to maybe hunt
some malicious evil.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.281
It's ridiculous. All of it.

19:12.985 --> 19:16.155
And that is truly dreadful.

19:17.723 --> 19:22.561
Well, sometimes,
you just have to fake it
till you make it. Ha!

19:24.796 --> 19:30.636
Apparently, I'm a time traveler
who makes films,

19:30.702 --> 19:32.304
and has allies
in the afterlife.

19:34.139 --> 19:36.742
I don't feel worthy
of that either,

19:36.842 --> 19:40.045
but I have to believe that

19:40.145 --> 19:44.049
eventually,
my purpose or destiny

19:44.149 --> 19:47.819
will come snatch me
from this infernal stasis.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.425
In the meantime, I drink.

19:53.525 --> 19:55.594
Oh, drink.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.529
And make friends.

19:57.596 --> 19:58.697
Mmm-hmm.

20:05.437 --> 20:06.905
- Wow.

20:07.005 --> 20:09.875
That's some... Phew!
That was very good.

20:11.043 --> 20:13.512
However, I do not think that
my destiny

20:13.579 --> 20:17.950
can quite come and snatch me up
when it's on ice.

20:19.084 --> 20:20.953
There's no way for me to
get home again.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.454
The time machine is broken,

20:22.554 --> 20:25.190
and no amount of faking it
will fix it.

20:25.958 --> 20:27.226
About that.

20:39.037 --> 20:42.708
Oh, Rita Farr.

20:51.116 --> 20:52.284
What are you?

20:57.456 --> 21:00.659
Toad bonnet bee.
Thatcher's blue bum.

21:00.759 --> 21:04.062
Toad bonnet bee.
Thatcher's blue bum.

21:04.129 --> 21:06.832
Toad bonnet bee.
Thatcher's blue bum.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.634
I am so fucking high.

21:19.244 --> 21:20.846
- Whoa.
Whoa.

21:22.514 --> 21:24.483
- Did you just...

21:43.001 --> 21:43.969
Wow.

21:48.473 --> 21:49.675
Whoa!

21:49.775 --> 21:50.809
Shit.

21:54.713 --> 21:56.148
Sorry, didn't mean to...

21:57.449 --> 21:59.618
Okay.

22:04.389 --> 22:07.125
Cherry two-ball screwballs?
Fuck, yeah!

22:14.533 --> 22:15.901
What the fuck?

22:21.373 --> 22:22.474
Cliff?

22:24.810 --> 22:25.711
Cliff?

22:29.581 --> 22:31.149
Narc-bot 2000.

22:31.216 --> 22:32.484
Jane!

22:35.520 --> 22:36.588
Hammerhead?

23:26.037 --> 23:28.140
Where are you?

23:28.240 --> 23:29.541
She never listens.

23:29.608 --> 23:31.076
Get the fuck
back here!

23:31.777 --> 23:33.311
Jane.

23:33.412 --> 23:36.148
Mind closing the door?

23:36.248 --> 23:38.417
It's a nasty draft
and all that.

23:50.562 --> 23:53.131
Don't worry.
They can't bother you in here.

23:55.066 --> 23:56.668
Who's they?

23:56.768 --> 23:59.905
You know, the others,
the Underground.

23:59.971 --> 24:03.842
- How the fuck did you--
- Ah! I didn't mean to pry.
Trust me.

24:03.942 --> 24:07.012
And in fact, you're the one
that's inside my head.

24:07.112 --> 24:10.182
You all are.
You and the superhero,
and the robot,

24:10.282 --> 24:12.784
the little radioactive mummy,
is it?

24:14.486 --> 24:17.989
Anyway, as much as I enjoy
a good party,

24:18.089 --> 24:19.791
you're the one
I wanted to talk to, Jane.

24:21.359 --> 24:22.527
Just you.

24:26.865 --> 24:28.934
You separated me
from the rest of
the Underground?

24:29.935 --> 24:31.603
From all but one little voice.

24:36.441 --> 24:38.143
Kay?

24:38.210 --> 24:40.178
There's more
on the bottom shelf here, love.

24:40.278 --> 24:41.980
There's some
chocolate buttons too.

24:42.714 --> 24:43.782
Yeah.

24:47.686 --> 24:48.887
How is this...

24:50.689 --> 24:52.691
What do you mean
we're inside your head?

24:52.791 --> 24:54.226
Well, that's what this is.

24:55.660 --> 24:59.064
Oh, my manners. Pardon me.

24:59.164 --> 25:03.034
I'm Shelley Byron.
Also known as The Fog...

25:03.134 --> 25:05.537
if you like, as you like.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.373
You care
for a little red velvet?

25:08.473 --> 25:10.408
The frosting is seraphic.

25:11.877 --> 25:14.579
- You're with the Sisterhood.
- Beguiling and perceptive.

25:15.514 --> 25:16.581
What a combination.

25:16.681 --> 25:20.585
You sure I can't tempt you
with something...

25:21.419 --> 25:22.988
Something sweet?

25:23.054 --> 25:25.257
You said you wanted to talk.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.359
- So let's talk.
- All right.

25:28.727 --> 25:31.830
- I wanna join the Sisterhood.
- Join...

25:31.897 --> 25:32.831
Did I stutter?

25:34.900 --> 25:38.436
All right, then.
Answer me this.

25:40.839 --> 25:42.340
Who are you, Jane?

25:45.911 --> 25:47.913
Cliff?

26:01.860 --> 26:03.061
Hey.

26:04.729 --> 26:05.931
Hey, brother.

26:08.099 --> 26:09.701
I'm here to join,
this the place?

26:11.069 --> 26:13.538
Brother, why are you?

26:27.452 --> 26:29.621
Where in the fuck...

26:29.721 --> 26:33.592
Oh, hey.
Sorry, I didn't mean to...

26:33.658 --> 26:37.228
Uh, actually,
I have no idea how I...

26:42.968 --> 26:44.903
I'm Jane.
You already know that.

26:44.970 --> 26:48.173
Yes. But who are you?

26:48.273 --> 26:51.610
My God. Really?

26:52.677 --> 26:54.846
- This is what we're doing?
- Yes.

26:54.946 --> 26:58.016
Fine. I'm the person
who's gonna rip your eyes out

26:58.116 --> 27:00.619
if you touch one hair
on that little girl's head.

27:00.685 --> 27:01.786
Oh, amazing.

27:04.122 --> 27:06.691
But still doesn't
really answer the question.

27:06.791 --> 27:08.460
Cool. How about you go first?

27:08.526 --> 27:09.761
Who the fuck are you

27:09.828 --> 27:11.363
and what the fuck are you
and the Sisterhood planning,

27:11.463 --> 27:13.531
because I'm guessing
you weren't leaving
bread crumbs

27:13.632 --> 27:16.034
all across the world
just so that we can sit here

27:16.134 --> 27:19.804
and talk in your weird
Candyland fuck-pad.

27:20.772 --> 27:21.873
Mmm.

27:23.508 --> 27:25.710
You're here
for the Eternal Flagellation.

27:27.445 --> 27:29.948
Sure. What the fuck is it?

27:30.015 --> 27:33.852
Oh. Well,
the Eternal Flagellation,

27:33.952 --> 27:38.690
it's a vulture cleaning
the carcass of an overfed sow.

27:38.790 --> 27:42.794
A powdered donut
sinking into an outhouse pit.

27:42.861 --> 27:44.062
Wow.

27:44.162 --> 27:46.698
That's some art-school level
pretentious bullshit.

27:46.798 --> 27:48.733
Well, maybe
that's what I am, Jane.

27:48.833 --> 27:50.001
Pretentious bullshit.

27:50.068 --> 27:52.303
Manure coursing
through my shrunken veins,

27:52.370 --> 27:53.471
but at least I know.

27:53.538 --> 27:56.508
And the question still remains,
dear Jane.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.577
Who are you?

27:59.678 --> 28:02.480
- Okay, Bye-bye.
You're limiting
yourself, you know?

28:03.314 --> 28:05.083
You and the girl.

28:05.183 --> 28:08.019
You're never truly free
until you know yourself.

28:08.687 --> 28:09.754
I know myself.

28:09.854 --> 28:15.560
She does, yes.
But you? No.

28:21.433 --> 28:24.335
Go on. Who do you think I am?

28:24.402 --> 28:26.171
I think you're scared.

28:27.539 --> 28:31.843
I think you're prone
to leaning back on old habits.

28:31.910 --> 28:36.247
You think denying your desires
makes you who you are,
makes you strong.

28:37.348 --> 28:39.117
You are the sort
of person, Jane,

28:39.217 --> 28:43.555
who could be
staring an opportunity
straight in the face

28:43.621 --> 28:45.256
and resent the promise of it.

28:47.525 --> 28:49.561
What you believe isn't true.

28:51.196 --> 28:54.365
Even a sorrowful
and unquenchable thing

28:55.800 --> 28:58.937
must savor the taste
of honey sometimes.

29:03.608 --> 29:05.376
<i>Why am I?</i>

29:05.443 --> 29:07.879
Do you mean why am I here
or why do I look like this?

29:09.047 --> 29:10.548
It's a simple question.

29:11.149 --> 29:12.250
I'm Cyborg.

29:13.818 --> 29:16.988
I am because the world
needs justice and order.

29:17.088 --> 29:19.324
I am because
I want to serve and protect.

29:19.424 --> 29:24.429
That was rehearsed and cliche
for a half-man, half-tin-can.

29:25.563 --> 29:27.332
And what are you
supposed to be?

29:27.432 --> 29:28.767
Half-man, half-bicycle?

29:31.836 --> 29:37.142
I assure you, Cyborg,
I'm at least three-fifths man.

29:38.943 --> 29:44.249
But what or why I am
should be of no importance
to you, the great Cyborg.

29:45.116 --> 29:47.485
Come.

29:50.255 --> 29:53.191
Sit.

29:53.291 --> 29:56.361
And maybe I will tell you
of the Eternal Flagellation.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.610
<i>I think
you asked me a question,</i>

30:12.677 --> 30:14.612
but I'm sorry,
I don't understand.

30:56.754 --> 30:59.691
Okay, thanks.

30:59.757 --> 31:03.862
So I guess I'm not
really a robot, technically.

31:04.829 --> 31:07.599
I have a brain. A human brain.

31:07.699 --> 31:10.435
Although it's not
working so good anymore.

31:10.535 --> 31:14.439
It's weird.
I was made to last forever,

31:14.539 --> 31:17.208
but I guess
I can't even do that right.

31:17.275 --> 31:19.777
I didn't think
I'd ever be scared of death.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.446
Spent most of my life
chasing it

31:21.546 --> 31:24.115
and then decades thinking
about it and wishing for it.

31:24.215 --> 31:26.618
I mean, I've been
dead two times over.

31:26.718 --> 31:30.355
Undead, too.
But now it's scary.

31:31.923 --> 31:33.958
I think about Rory.

31:34.058 --> 31:36.227
I think about
never holding him again

31:36.294 --> 31:38.963
or seeing him do his dumb
little baby-fart smile,

31:39.063 --> 31:40.231
and I just...

31:41.232 --> 31:45.937
If I could cry... I'd cry.

31:46.704 --> 31:47.939
A lot.

32:38.690 --> 32:40.191
Wow, that's...

32:40.291 --> 32:43.094
Is this a hug moment?
It feels like a hug moment.

32:43.161 --> 32:44.529
Bring it in, sister.

32:55.139 --> 32:56.774
What the hell are you?

33:00.111 --> 33:02.447
If you turn out to be a rat...

33:02.513 --> 33:07.218
Okay, Larry,
maybe stop talking
to your magic zit-thing.

33:21.366 --> 33:24.669
Yeah, Larry, you're really
going bananas over here.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.073
What the hell?

33:31.909 --> 33:34.412
Hello?

33:34.512 --> 33:37.815
Stolen toast,
weather pony.

33:37.882 --> 33:40.351
Oh, shit. Shit, shit,
shit, shit, shit!

33:46.724 --> 33:47.825
Paul?

33:51.696 --> 33:52.764
Paul Trainor!

34:01.239 --> 34:02.740
♪ <i>And the company jumps ♪</i>

34:02.840 --> 34:04.175
<i>♪ When he plays reveille ♪</i>

34:04.242 --> 34:08.212
♪ <i>He's the boogie woogie
Bugle boy of Company B ♪</i>

34:15.353 --> 34:17.789
Good as new!

34:17.889 --> 34:19.957
So, what do we set it to?

34:21.559 --> 34:24.228
The letter
was dated 1949, but...

34:26.097 --> 34:29.200
the film was 1917.

34:29.267 --> 34:34.205
The possibilities really
are endless, aren't they?

34:34.272 --> 34:36.974
Oh, there, there.

34:37.074 --> 34:40.211
Larry and the others
will be home with news soon

34:40.278 --> 34:43.147
and whatever they find out,
big or small,

34:43.247 --> 34:45.450
will be a step in the right
direction.

34:45.550 --> 34:50.888
And then Laura De Mille
will hop into her time machine

34:50.955 --> 34:55.126
and go back to figure
all the rest of it out.

34:55.226 --> 34:59.964
And you will have
yourself again.

35:00.064 --> 35:03.101
And I know that self is good.

35:04.735 --> 35:06.971
I have an intuition
for this sort of thing.

35:08.506 --> 35:09.974
I need more gin.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.444
That's the spirit!

35:15.513 --> 35:16.747
I'll be here.

35:18.082 --> 35:24.188
Rita Farr.
World renowned time traveler.

35:27.091 --> 35:30.094
Waiting for my destiny.

35:34.832 --> 35:36.000
You have to try this.

35:38.035 --> 35:40.505
- Thank you.
- You're very welcome, my dear.

35:52.483 --> 35:55.853
So what's with this
whole sweet-treats bullshit?

35:55.953 --> 36:00.791
I don't remember.
I built this place a while ago.

36:00.858 --> 36:02.960
Decades, I think.

36:03.027 --> 36:06.130
Time, it moved like
a hummingbird at the Ant Farm.

36:06.197 --> 36:09.667
Fast ellipses,
beats of nothing in between.

36:09.734 --> 36:11.169
Too much of everything.

36:12.170 --> 36:14.238
I was their dragon, you know?

36:15.506 --> 36:18.176
They would drop me
into towns and villages

36:18.242 --> 36:21.078
and I would eat
the whole place up.

36:21.179 --> 36:25.816
Hundreds and thousands
of people crying,
praying, screaming.

36:26.584 --> 36:28.920
And all up in here.

36:29.020 --> 36:32.823
So, as you can imagine,
it got a little crowded.

36:32.890 --> 36:35.860
And I needed a space
that was just for me.

36:35.927 --> 36:37.695
So it's not
just for lost girls.

36:40.865 --> 36:42.233
The Eternal whatever.

36:44.535 --> 36:46.571
That's what this is all about.

36:46.671 --> 36:49.907
You were wronged,
and now you wanna burn
the whole world down.

36:50.007 --> 36:52.610
Sometimes you have to
set worlds on fire

36:52.710 --> 36:54.345
so you can make something new.

36:56.247 --> 36:57.281
Mmm.

36:58.516 --> 37:00.084
Make something of your pain.

37:02.687 --> 37:05.356
Maybe we have more in common
than you think, Jane.

37:19.937 --> 37:23.040
Paul! Oh, my God.

37:25.309 --> 37:27.545
What...
What are you doing here?

37:30.314 --> 37:33.150
No! No, Paul.
Paul, listen to me.

37:58.109 --> 37:59.844
Bang, bang bagel.

38:03.748 --> 38:04.949
Pink and blue.

38:15.693 --> 38:17.295
What was that thing
you mentioned?

38:18.129 --> 38:19.597
Eternal Flagellation?

38:21.966 --> 38:23.434
Is that part of the Sisterhood?

38:23.501 --> 38:25.202
I asked you a question.

38:26.871 --> 38:28.039
Why are you?

38:29.340 --> 38:31.942
Didn't I just answer that?

38:32.009 --> 38:36.147
Did you? Or did someone else
just answer with your voice?

38:36.213 --> 38:39.050
- Excuse me?
- Why are you?

38:39.150 --> 38:40.885
Answer your own damn question.

38:41.552 --> 38:42.653
Why are you?

38:42.720 --> 38:46.223
I am because I have loved
with torrid abandon.

38:47.892 --> 38:50.861
I am because I've laughed
my father's laugh

38:52.663 --> 38:56.967
and I sang the songs
my grandmother sang
in a ship crossing water.

38:57.034 --> 39:02.907
I am because I've bled
and I've suffered and found joy

39:03.007 --> 39:08.079
from between the fetid trees
and in barber shops.

39:08.179 --> 39:12.049
But as I said, why I am
is of no importance to you,

39:12.149 --> 39:13.584
the great Cyborg.

39:14.752 --> 39:16.887
A man who doesn't even
know himself.

39:18.155 --> 39:22.159
A man who knows only
that he is a raised hand.

39:22.226 --> 39:24.762
- And what do you get
when you raise your hand?

39:26.197 --> 39:27.698
Walk down the street?

39:30.267 --> 39:31.702
Drive through town?

39:32.536 --> 39:34.405
Lay asleep in your bed?

39:34.505 --> 39:37.108
Man, what the hell
are you getting at?

39:37.208 --> 39:39.110
Are you saying that
I don't know how to suffer?

39:39.210 --> 39:41.078
That I don't know
discrimination?

39:41.178 --> 39:43.547
How can you know
suffering or joy

39:43.614 --> 39:44.882
without knowing who you are?

39:44.949 --> 39:46.617
Fuck this bullshit!

39:46.717 --> 39:49.019
You don't get to tell me
who the fuck I am!

39:49.086 --> 39:51.522
The only goddamn reason
you're free in the first place

39:51.589 --> 39:52.690
is because of me.

39:54.058 --> 39:57.128
The language of the oppressor.

39:57.228 --> 40:00.865
And to spill from your mouth
with such careless ease.

40:00.931 --> 40:02.933
Imagine my surprise, brother.

40:04.068 --> 40:06.036
I sat in a cage
for near a century

40:06.103 --> 40:10.808
and I emerged Lazarus
and beheld a world the same.

40:10.908 --> 40:12.977
And this is why

40:13.077 --> 40:15.579
the Eternal Flagellation
is so important.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.950
You can tune them out
if you want, Jane.

40:20.050 --> 40:21.318
You're letting them
overpower you.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.053
They're not overpowering me,
they're afraid for Kay.

40:23.120 --> 40:26.157
- Come on, time to go.
- Are they afraid for the girl
or of the girl?

40:26.257 --> 40:28.592
Kay, please, I'll get you more
ice cream later, I promise.

40:28.659 --> 40:29.927
Jane, listen to me.

40:29.994 --> 40:31.228
- Kay, come on!

40:31.295 --> 40:33.264
Jane, you're denying
yourself again.

40:33.330 --> 40:34.899
Wouldn't it be nice to be free?

40:34.965 --> 40:36.567
To express yourself unbridled?

40:36.634 --> 40:39.503
To get lost in your thoughts
and only your thoughts?

40:39.603 --> 40:41.772
Your wants. Your desires.

40:42.773 --> 40:43.908
I'd like that.

40:45.109 --> 40:46.277
Kay!

40:50.815 --> 40:52.249
You know,
this is definitely

40:52.316 --> 40:53.951
the most fun
I've had in a while.

40:54.018 --> 40:56.287
And don't get me wrong,
you're cool and all,

40:56.353 --> 41:00.458
but I should be with Rory.
I should be living!

41:00.524 --> 41:04.862
Trying new things!
Being the best grandpa ever!

41:04.962 --> 41:06.831
Not running around
on some bullshit mission

41:06.931 --> 41:08.999
because of
Laura fucking De Mille.

41:14.672 --> 41:18.108
Laura De Mille. She sent you.

41:19.310 --> 41:21.812
Laura fucking De Mille.

41:29.386 --> 41:32.122
You can't stop this.

41:32.189 --> 41:35.826
The world needs it.
You need it!

41:38.829 --> 41:41.398
Stop! I said stop!

41:44.201 --> 41:46.904
Why are you, Cyborg?

41:47.004 --> 41:49.340
Because you're born
with this Black skin?

41:49.406 --> 41:51.075
Or because you're made

41:51.175 --> 41:53.043
with their metal disguise?

41:53.143 --> 41:54.211
Fuck you!

41:54.311 --> 41:55.513
<i>♪ And they had each other ♪</i>

41:55.579 --> 41:57.381
<i>♪ Who could ask for more ♪</i>

41:57.481 --> 41:58.883
<i>♪ At the Copa... ♪</i>

41:58.983 --> 42:00.818
Oh, hey, ice cream lady!
What's up?

42:11.195 --> 42:13.430
- There you are, little monkey--
- No, I don't wanna!

42:13.531 --> 42:16.066
Kay, we should go now.
Come on--

42:16.166 --> 42:17.001
No!

42:19.503 --> 42:21.906
I'll see you
on the other side.

42:24.174 --> 42:26.710
And give
Laura De Mille my best.

42:31.749 --> 42:35.719
What the fuck?
What the fuck?

42:35.786 --> 42:38.689
Come on.

42:43.727 --> 42:44.728
My son.

42:45.863 --> 42:47.598
- Hey, hey.

42:48.532 --> 42:51.435
You're okay, you're okay, bud.

42:52.236 --> 42:53.304
It's okay.

42:55.639 --> 42:57.241
You're back!

42:57.308 --> 43:00.277
Larry, I've got news--

43:00.377 --> 43:02.146
Excuse you.

43:02.947 --> 43:04.381
Oh, my God. Is that--

43:04.448 --> 43:06.584
The king. Crow pies--

43:06.650 --> 43:07.651
What the hell happened?

43:07.751 --> 43:09.253
Got our asses handed to us.

43:09.320 --> 43:10.888
But you came back
with something?

43:10.955 --> 43:14.325
Nope.
- Then we'll just have to
go back and try again.

43:14.425 --> 43:16.160
Give the Sisterhood of Dada
the what for!

43:16.260 --> 43:17.661
Nope. Fuck them.

43:17.761 --> 43:20.431
Sorry, Rita,
but I'm with Cliff.

43:20.497 --> 43:23.667
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I've spent all day
giving pep talks

43:23.767 --> 43:26.837
and fixing up that
blasted time machine
so Laura can go--

43:26.937 --> 43:28.806
Look, let me put this
as plainly as possible.

43:28.906 --> 43:32.176
Fuck the time machine.
Fuck the Sisterhood of Dada.

43:32.276 --> 43:33.510
And fuck Laura De Mille.

44:34.805 --> 44:40.511
-"Grandpa's getting better."

44:56.360 --> 44:58.662
Well, I'm not
fucking dying today.

44:59.930 --> 45:01.765
- Click.

45:03.500 --> 45:04.735
What's going on?

45:04.835 --> 45:06.537
We're keeping an eye
on the girl.

45:07.438 --> 45:08.572
Okay.

45:10.941 --> 45:12.876
Maybe you should
give her some space?

45:15.612 --> 45:17.548
What happened to
"we're all in this together"?

45:19.516 --> 45:22.119
She's just throwing a tantrum.
That's what kids do.

45:22.219 --> 45:25.456
She wants something new
so I'll get her some shoes
and everything will be fine.

45:25.556 --> 45:28.459
I can handle the girl
and her yearnings.

45:28.559 --> 45:32.062
You, however, I don't know
what to do with you.

46:29.019 --> 46:31.588
I can't believe
they sucked you into all this.

46:34.625 --> 46:36.293
I'm gonna get you well again.

46:38.462 --> 46:39.797
I promise.

46:39.863 --> 46:42.866
And nothing's
going to get between us.

46:47.971 --> 46:49.473
<i>As the saying goes,</i>

46:49.540 --> 46:51.475
"If you want
something done right,

46:52.342 --> 46:53.777
you have to do it yourself."

46:57.948 --> 46:59.049
You.

47:00.818 --> 47:01.685
Listen.

47:03.854 --> 47:07.391
You leave it up to me.
Rita Farr.

47:07.491 --> 47:09.159
World renowned time traveler.

47:09.226 --> 47:11.562
Oh, okay. All right.

47:11.662 --> 47:14.898
Rita Farr. Rita Farr.

47:14.998 --> 47:21.371
You know, I've known you
for a little less than 48 hours

47:21.471 --> 47:27.477
and even I know that that
is not who you are. Mmm-mmm.

47:27.544 --> 47:30.547
No. No, no, no.

47:30.647 --> 47:34.418
That's never gonna be
who you are.

48:10.754 --> 48:12.289
Fuck it.
