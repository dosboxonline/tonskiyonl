WEBVTT

01:37.806 --> 01:38.891
Where's your mom?

01:40.267 --> 01:41.685
She went to Ryan's.

01:42.561 --> 01:43.562
Why?

01:45.856 --> 01:48.358
She said Mindy sounded bad on the phone.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.569
Wanted to check on them.

01:51.862 --> 01:52.863
Yeah.

01:58.785 --> 02:02.247
Hey, how about a late-night deep dish?

02:03.415 --> 02:06.251
Yeah. You speak my language.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.252
Be right back.

03:50.814 --> 03:51.857
Hey.

04:01.033 --> 04:02.451
How do I know you?

04:04.161 --> 04:05.287
It's Daniela.

04:08.081 --> 04:09.917
The Honda Civic Daniela?

04:13.295 --> 04:15.297
Yeah. That's the one.

04:17.089 --> 04:20.260
You burn through brake pads
faster than any other customer I ever had.

04:22.888 --> 04:24.014
Yeah?

04:27.017 --> 04:28.268
I'm your customer?

04:28.894 --> 04:32.231
Loyalty Motors. Logan Square.

04:34.149 --> 04:36.109
Do you really think you're a mechanic?

04:36.777 --> 04:38.403
I am a mechanic.

04:44.326 --> 04:46.328
What's the last thing you remember?

04:53.043 --> 04:54.795
Well, I was at my bar.

04:55.796 --> 04:57.005
- And--
- Which bar?

04:57.756 --> 05:00.425
Shakers in Logan Square. In--

05:02.678 --> 05:04.012
I mean, yeah, I...

05:05.681 --> 05:07.057
I got a little out of hand.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.769
And then this guy
kept buying me shots, so--

05:10.769 --> 05:12.229
- Just--
- Who was?

05:12.229 --> 05:13.313
I didn't--

05:14.022 --> 05:15.983
I'd never seen him before. He was--

05:16.525 --> 05:20.320
He told me his name. It was James or--

05:21.029 --> 05:22.030
I don't know.

05:29.788 --> 05:30.789
This guy?

05:35.085 --> 05:37.880
- Yeah.
- This guy was buying you drinks?

05:37.880 --> 05:39.214
Yeah.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.507
Who is he?

05:53.687 --> 05:55.355
I just texted it to you.

05:55.981 --> 05:57.983
Got it. Big Shoulders Mental Health.

05:59.151 --> 06:00.944
Sure I can't drive you?

06:00.944 --> 06:02.029
We'll be okay.

06:03.030 --> 06:05.741
Okay. Let me know how it goes, okay?

06:05.741 --> 06:07.034
Okay. Thank you.

07:09.346 --> 07:10.347
Hey.

07:18.647 --> 07:20.357
Hey. Hey!

07:21.108 --> 07:22.109
Hey!

08:40.729 --> 08:41.855
Hey, Dad.

08:42.606 --> 08:43.607
Hey.

08:44.942 --> 08:46.944
Pizza's here. I got us Pequod's.

08:47.694 --> 08:49.404
Cool. Cool.

08:51.990 --> 08:53.158
I'll be right inside.

08:55.536 --> 08:56.662
You doing something out here?

08:56.662 --> 09:00.582
Yeah, I was just moving some stuff around.

09:01.208 --> 09:02.459
You need a hand?

09:02.459 --> 09:06.463
What? No. I'm fine. I'll see you inside.

09:06.463 --> 09:07.548
Okay.

10:08.525 --> 10:09.943
Jason, you good?

10:11.236 --> 10:12.237
Yeah.

10:15.908 --> 10:17.910
I need a drink.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.204
That was quick.

10:20.204 --> 10:21.496
- What?
- Same?

10:23.665 --> 10:24.666
Yeah.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.509
Here you go, brother.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.503
Fuck me.

11:33.151 --> 11:34.486
When did you--

11:39.658 --> 11:40.659
Tonight.

11:43.078 --> 11:44.079
You?

11:44.079 --> 11:45.706
Yesterday.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.125
So you were kidnapped too?

11:48.125 --> 11:49.251
Yeah.

11:50.836 --> 11:55.215
Daniela was killed right in front of me.

11:55.215 --> 11:58.135
The other Daniela.

11:58.135 --> 11:59.636
Me too.

11:59.636 --> 12:02.181
Were you taken back to Velocity
and beaten?

12:03.640 --> 12:05.434
Amanda helped me escape.

12:05.434 --> 12:06.560
Same.

12:08.353 --> 12:09.563
Same.

12:12.983 --> 12:17.779
Well, I guess this was inevitable,
that the different versions of us

12:17.779 --> 12:19.156
would spawn in the box.

12:20.324 --> 12:22.075
But how many?

12:22.075 --> 12:25.704
I know some of them
must have been killed or lost.

12:25.704 --> 12:27.206
Or ran out of ampoules.

12:27.915 --> 12:31.460
But some of them, like you and like me,
made the right choices.

12:31.460 --> 12:32.753
Right choices.

12:32.753 --> 12:33.754
Or got lucky.

12:34.713 --> 12:38.509
Our paths may have been altered
by different doors and different worlds,

12:38.509 --> 12:43.555
but eventually,
they made their way back to this Chicago.

12:44.890 --> 12:50.020
Every choice I made in there
created a different Jason.

12:50.020 --> 12:51.980
And every choice those Jasons made.

12:53.607 --> 12:54.900
And those Jasons.

12:56.902 --> 12:57.986
And those Jasons.

13:00.572 --> 13:01.573
Fuck.

13:09.748 --> 13:11.250
Where's your Amanda?

13:17.172 --> 13:18.465
She...

13:21.927 --> 13:23.136
I lost her.

13:27.057 --> 13:28.058
Where?

13:34.314 --> 13:35.607
Very dark world.

13:39.862 --> 13:40.863
Yours?

13:42.531 --> 13:44.908
She found a place that she wanted to stay.

13:47.744 --> 13:48.871
That's good.

13:52.124 --> 13:54.376
Do you have any ampoules left?

13:55.502 --> 13:56.628
Me neither.

13:59.423 --> 14:00.841
So here we are.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.676
Here we are.

14:04.303 --> 14:05.554
What now?

14:06.305 --> 14:08.599
You must have thought of Kankakee, right?

14:09.433 --> 14:12.227
I only know about that first reserve
because of Charlie.

14:12.227 --> 14:13.896
We only know about it because of Charlie.

14:13.896 --> 14:17.608
Jason Two, that's what I call him,
doesn't know about it.

14:18.942 --> 14:19.776
Right.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.738
Take him for a drive at night.

14:24.948 --> 14:28.952
Take him for a walk down one of the paths
on the north side of the river, and then--

14:28.952 --> 14:30.245
I thought about it today.

14:30.245 --> 14:32.331
I dug the grave today.

14:36.710 --> 14:38.212
We don't have a gun.

14:39.713 --> 14:41.048
You don't have a gun.

14:43.634 --> 14:44.635
Okay.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.514
It's a pretty good plan,

14:50.098 --> 14:52.601
but now there's a whole lot more
to contend with.

14:56.230 --> 14:58.315
We all want the same thing.

14:59.983 --> 15:01.693
We all want our family back.

15:02.319 --> 15:03.779
We all want our life back.

15:03.779 --> 15:08.700
Till a month ago we were exactly
the same person with the same thoughts.

15:08.700 --> 15:11.036
We said exactly the same things.

15:11.036 --> 15:13.455
We had the same fears and the same love.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.541
We think of him as Jason Two,

15:16.375 --> 15:19.545
which means we all think
of ourselves as Jason One.

15:20.712 --> 15:22.214
Can't all be Jason One.

15:26.510 --> 15:28.011
How many do you think made it back?

15:29.179 --> 15:30.889
One of them tried to kill me last night.

15:30.889 --> 15:32.516
One followed me today.

15:35.310 --> 15:40.023
If I get my hands on Jason Two,
he's definitely gonna pay.

15:40.774 --> 15:41.984
Definitely.

15:41.984 --> 15:45.779
Now, I don't wanna hurt you
or anyone like us,

15:46.780 --> 15:50.492
but I'm not gonna let anyone get in the
way of me being with Daniela and Charlie.

16:01.837 --> 16:02.963
These are on me.

18:13.468 --> 18:15.888
Anything else? Warm you up?

18:16.430 --> 18:17.431
Yeah.

18:19.766 --> 18:21.018
No rush, okay?

18:21.018 --> 18:22.102
Thank you.

19:15.447 --> 19:17.032
You can't do that in here.

19:19.159 --> 19:20.410
You can't do that.

19:22.746 --> 19:26.333
There's nothing like a fine cigar
after a lovely meal.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.876
Or so I've heard.

19:31.463 --> 19:32.756
You can't smoke in here.

19:36.927 --> 19:38.554
Do I need to get my manager?

19:44.935 --> 19:47.062
You are a very rude man.

19:52.609 --> 19:55.445
You can't smoke inside.
You're disturbing the other customers.

20:04.288 --> 20:06.915
Am I disturbing anyone with my cigar?

20:06.915 --> 20:08.667
Yes.

20:08.667 --> 20:09.751
Yeah, you are.

20:18.468 --> 20:19.678
Put it out.

20:24.933 --> 20:26.101
Now.

20:29.479 --> 20:32.149
Hey, can I ask you a personal question?

20:34.484 --> 20:35.485
Can I--

20:37.487 --> 20:39.489
How did you become a detective?

20:48.498 --> 20:49.750
Yeah?

20:52.252 --> 20:53.462
Morning.

20:53.462 --> 20:54.796
Get up early?

20:55.923 --> 20:57.174
Can you take Charlie to school?

20:57.799 --> 20:58.800
Sure.

21:01.011 --> 21:03.138
I have some pieces to move at the gallery.

21:04.306 --> 21:05.641
Can I take the Civic?

21:07.351 --> 21:08.685
Just take Charlie's.

21:08.685 --> 21:10.771
It's fine. I'll drive the Civic.
I know you hate it.

21:10.771 --> 21:14.066
Nah. Charlie's has more space, and...

21:14.775 --> 21:17.152
I forgot to get gas for the Civic, so...

21:17.152 --> 21:18.612
Well, is it empty?

21:18.612 --> 21:21.865
Honey, just take Charlie's.

21:24.826 --> 21:25.911
Sure.

21:27.788 --> 21:29.039
See you later.

21:29.039 --> 21:30.123
Hey...

21:33.502 --> 21:35.879
how was Ryan last night?

21:36.463 --> 21:38.048
Not great, actually.

21:40.092 --> 21:43.262
I just can't believe that he relapsed
after all these years.

21:44.263 --> 21:45.514
That's what he said.

21:50.102 --> 21:51.854
- Gotta run.
- All right.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.329
I'd let you drive.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.832
- The car is just playing up a little.
- It's fine.

22:11.832 --> 22:12.916
It's--

22:15.169 --> 22:16.336
Where are we going?

22:16.336 --> 22:18.505
What do you mean?
I'm dropping you at school.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.299
What about the University of Chicago?

22:20.966 --> 22:23.594
I thought you were gonna
show me around campus.

22:24.845 --> 22:26.513
- Today? I said--
- Yeah.

22:27.598 --> 22:28.974
- What--
- You know what?

22:28.974 --> 22:30.601
No. Forget it.

22:30.601 --> 22:33.562
You know what? I said we'd go.

22:35.189 --> 22:36.231
We'll go.

22:42.821 --> 22:45.324
You know I don't have
the grades to go here, right?

22:46.992 --> 22:48.619
It's never too late.

22:48.619 --> 22:50.370
You can turn things around.

22:54.583 --> 22:59.171
So, there's the physics department.
That's where I spent most of my time here.

22:59.755 --> 23:03.175
The house where I met your mom, actually,
is right over there.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.344
The garden party?

23:06.553 --> 23:08.180
Almost didn't go.

23:09.556 --> 23:10.766
Decided last minute.

23:10.766 --> 23:12.935
Do you ever think about if you hadn't?

23:12.935 --> 23:15.437
Yeah, I would have regretted
it for the rest of my life.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.314
No, you wouldn't.

23:18.690 --> 23:20.234
Regretting is easy.

23:21.151 --> 23:22.819
There's nothing
you can actually do about it.

23:23.445 --> 23:25.989
Maybe you'll understand
when you get older.

23:25.989 --> 23:28.367
Yeah, or maybe
you're too old to understand.

23:29.618 --> 23:31.328
Why are you saying all this?

23:32.120 --> 23:36.834
Your whole life hinged on a moment
that's basically just a freak accident.

23:36.834 --> 23:39.837
I mean, the smallest little choice
to go to a party?

23:41.171 --> 23:42.172
What?

23:42.965 --> 23:44.842
- What's up? You okay?
- Yeah.

23:44.842 --> 23:47.970
Let's just--
Come on, thought I saw someone.

23:49.471 --> 23:51.098
I wanna show you the library.

23:54.476 --> 23:55.477
Come on.

23:55.477 --> 23:56.562
Okay.

25:42.251 --> 25:43.252
Hello?

25:51.969 --> 25:53.345
Hey, excuse me. Could we get...

25:53.345 --> 25:54.513
Yeah, you need to swipe.

25:55.472 --> 25:57.683
I just wanna take him
for a quick look at the library.

25:57.683 --> 25:59.351
Do you a visitor's pass?

25:59.351 --> 26:03.188
No, I-- No, I'm alumni
and he's on a college tour.

26:03.856 --> 26:06.692
- Dad, it's okay. Let's just go.
- Please. Please, I promised.

26:06.692 --> 26:08.819
Get passes for next time, okay?

26:08.819 --> 26:11.071
Thank you. We'll be really quick.

26:11.071 --> 26:12.197
Come on.

26:13.323 --> 26:14.741
- What?
- Yeah.

26:15.659 --> 26:16.660
See?

26:23.959 --> 26:26.837
- Now, this, this is really cool.
- Yeah, come on. Come on.

26:28.297 --> 26:29.590
Did you used to study here?

26:29.590 --> 26:32.551
They built it after I graduated.

26:37.514 --> 26:38.807
- Come here.
- What's up?

26:38.807 --> 26:40.559
Just sit-- Take a seat.

26:48.734 --> 26:50.861
It's pretty cool, huh?

26:54.698 --> 26:56.909
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

26:56.909 --> 26:58.827
- Yeah. Yeah.
- You sure?

27:06.293 --> 27:07.586
Come on.

27:07.586 --> 27:10.005
So, there's not much down that way.

27:10.005 --> 27:11.590
- Come on.
- What is going on with you?

27:11.590 --> 27:13.759
- What?
- You are acting really weird.

27:13.759 --> 27:15.093
All right, just listen.

27:15.093 --> 27:18.931
I forgot I have to do something.
I'm gonna-- Listen, take the car.

27:18.931 --> 27:21.600
You're gonna meet me
at the south gate on 57th

27:21.600 --> 27:23.477
and South University, okay?

27:23.477 --> 27:25.354
Okay, I don't even know where that is.

27:25.354 --> 27:27.481
Just get your phone and map it.

27:27.481 --> 27:28.941
Dad, I only have a permit.

27:28.941 --> 27:31.026
Charlie, you're gonna be fine. Come on.

27:41.662 --> 27:42.996
Dad, what the fuck is going on?

27:42.996 --> 27:46.291
Listen, I'm gonna explain everything
to you in the car when we meet.

27:46.291 --> 27:47.626
Where did I say? Tell me.

27:47.626 --> 27:49.253
South University and 57th.

27:49.253 --> 27:52.256
57th. Good. All right, go. Trust me.

29:49.706 --> 29:50.832
Wait, wait, wait!

29:50.832 --> 29:52.835
What-- What do you need?

29:53.585 --> 29:54.753
What do you need?

32:07.052 --> 32:08.220
Fuck.

33:04.318 --> 33:05.569
License and registration.

33:06.111 --> 33:07.196
Yeah.

33:15.412 --> 33:16.705
Learner's permit, huh?

33:16.705 --> 33:17.831
Officer!

33:19.708 --> 33:23.545
It's-- That's my car. That's my son.

33:23.545 --> 33:25.172
He can't park here.

33:25.172 --> 33:28.467
No, we were just leaving.
He was waiting for me.

33:28.467 --> 33:31.553
We're on a college tour
and I used to be a student here.

33:31.553 --> 33:33.680
He just can't park on an active road.

33:33.680 --> 33:35.599
I'm sorry, Officer.

33:35.599 --> 33:37.601
Yeah. It is my fault.

33:40.437 --> 33:41.563
I'm sorry.

33:42.231 --> 33:43.232
Yeah.

33:43.232 --> 33:44.691
Thank you. Appreciate it.

33:46.527 --> 33:47.528
Be careful.

33:47.528 --> 33:49.321
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

33:49.321 --> 33:50.489
Nice day.

33:51.281 --> 33:53.158
- All right, fuck.
- I think you should drive.

33:53.158 --> 33:54.326
Just drive.

33:54.910 --> 33:57.746
- Just drive! Drive! Fucking drive.
- Okay.

34:06.964 --> 34:08.172
Sign and date.

34:16.223 --> 34:17.431
Thank you.

34:37.244 --> 34:38.453
Oh, my God.

34:39.913 --> 34:41.706
No. Don't touch me.

34:43.833 --> 34:45.210
Smoking in a restaurant?

34:45.210 --> 34:48.797
I just needed to get you
to a place that we could talk.

34:48.797 --> 34:49.882
Why?

34:51.884 --> 34:53.635
Do you have something honest to say?

34:55.094 --> 34:57.181
Because I'm done with the lies.

34:57.764 --> 34:59.474
Bailed you out. You're welcome.

35:00.225 --> 35:02.853
Whatever happened, it wasn't me.

35:02.853 --> 35:04.688
- Okay. No.
- Now listen--

35:04.688 --> 35:07.274
The night of Ryan's
celebration at the Village Tap,

35:07.274 --> 35:08.901
that was the last time that I saw you.

35:08.901 --> 35:10.402
What are you even saying?

35:10.402 --> 35:12.070
That man isn't me.

35:12.070 --> 35:14.072
He's another version of me.

35:14.072 --> 35:16.783
He built a box. My box.

35:16.783 --> 35:19.453
And he has access to other realities,

35:19.453 --> 35:23.874
and he stole me from my world
so that he could take my life.

35:23.874 --> 35:25.792
Do you know how that sounds?

35:25.792 --> 35:28.045
I can prove it. Call me.

35:29.963 --> 35:30.964
I'm sorry.

35:30.964 --> 35:35.886
If it's the last thing
I ever ask you to do. Just call me.

35:49.608 --> 35:50.943
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

35:54.112 --> 35:55.447
See?

35:59.868 --> 36:04.498
Call him back and say
that you've been thinking about

36:04.498 --> 36:07.668
how we had such a great time
at the Keys last Christmas

36:07.668 --> 36:09.127
that you wanna go back.

36:09.127 --> 36:10.963
We didn't go to the Keys last Christmas.

36:10.963 --> 36:13.382
I know that but he doesn't.

36:17.970 --> 36:19.179
Okay, answer.

36:24.309 --> 36:25.394
Hello?

36:25.394 --> 36:26.478
<i>Hey.</i>

36:27.604 --> 36:30.232
<i>I think we got cut off. Are you there?</i>

36:30.858 --> 36:32.234
<i>Is everything okay?</i>

36:33.485 --> 36:34.486
Yeah.

36:37.656 --> 36:39.491
I was just thinking.

36:41.535 --> 36:46.498
We took that trip last year
when went to the Keys for Christmas.

36:47.457 --> 36:49.168
What if we went back?

36:50.043 --> 36:51.044
<i>Yeah.</i>

36:51.044 --> 36:52.337
<i>Definitely.</i>

36:53.255 --> 36:54.756
Do you remember the house?

36:56.508 --> 36:59.553
The pink and white one by the beach?

36:59.553 --> 37:02.472
<i>Yeah. No, I loved that place.</i>

37:04.057 --> 37:05.309
Me too.

37:05.309 --> 37:07.603
<i>Well, let's make it happen.</i>

37:08.312 --> 37:09.646
<i>Hey, Mom.</i>

37:10.355 --> 37:12.649
<i>We decided to play hooky today.</i>

37:12.649 --> 37:15.277
<i>Listen, honey, I need you to come home.</i>

37:15.277 --> 37:16.361
Why?

37:16.361 --> 37:18.655
<i>Just-- I'll explain it when you get here.</i>

37:34.338 --> 37:35.589
How is this possible?

37:35.589 --> 37:37.257
It's not just him.

37:40.219 --> 37:44.223
There are other versions of me
here as well.

37:53.982 --> 37:55.400
I have to get Charlie.

37:57.402 --> 37:59.071
Please let me come.

38:04.076 --> 38:05.452
Where would we meet?

38:10.749 --> 38:14.461
You'll need to pick 'cause
he thinks exactly like me.

38:17.923 --> 38:18.924
The Bean.

38:21.969 --> 38:25.889
And we'll need a safe word
so that you know it's me.

38:29.226 --> 38:30.352
Jupiter.

38:33.522 --> 38:34.690
Jupiter.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.067
I'm not saying we'll come.

38:41.947 --> 38:42.990
Be careful.

38:44.366 --> 38:46.034
Please. Be careful.

38:47.703 --> 38:48.954
He's dangerous.

39:45.886 --> 39:46.929
Hello?

40:15.999 --> 40:17.417
Hi.

40:20.170 --> 40:21.421
Where's Charlie?

40:22.047 --> 40:24.758
He's gone down to get a suitcase.

40:25.592 --> 40:26.468
Why?

40:26.468 --> 40:29.179
'Cause we need to get out of here.
We need to leave.

40:30.013 --> 40:33.350
Honey, we're in a little bit of trouble,
okay? I'll explain.

40:34.017 --> 40:36.270
It's got something to do with
the investment and Leighton--

40:36.270 --> 40:37.437
What happened?

40:37.437 --> 40:39.439
Just grab a suitcase, please.

40:40.315 --> 40:42.609
Get some things together,
we're gonna have to leave.

40:43.527 --> 40:44.736
Now!

40:55.956 --> 40:58.250
Charlie. Listen, we're gonna--

40:58.250 --> 40:59.334
Hey.

41:03.255 --> 41:04.464
Could you come out here?

41:07.676 --> 41:08.677
Yeah.

41:16.435 --> 41:19.062
Look, I'm sorry if I scared you.

41:19.646 --> 41:20.647
Okay?

41:24.193 --> 41:27.196
So, you're getting a suitcase?

41:28.071 --> 41:29.114
I am.

41:31.491 --> 41:32.492
Okay.

41:41.126 --> 41:42.127
Yeah.

41:57.809 --> 41:59.061
What are you doing?

41:59.978 --> 42:00.979
Nothing.

42:11.657 --> 42:14.201
Taking the RAV4, not the Civic.

42:15.494 --> 42:16.620
Take that.

42:18.330 --> 42:19.831
Don't forget your phone.

42:20.707 --> 42:21.708
Thank you.

42:24.211 --> 42:25.379
Are you getting a bag?

42:28.632 --> 42:29.925
Yeah.

42:29.925 --> 42:32.135
I was gonna get one from the basement.

42:33.595 --> 42:34.721
Can you help me reach it?

42:54.449 --> 42:55.826
- Mom?
- Get back in.

42:55.826 --> 42:57.703
- Mom, what's going on?
- Get back in the car.

43:06.295 --> 43:08.672
Hey! Come with me! It's not safe!

43:10.340 --> 43:11.466
Just leave it, Charlie.

43:11.466 --> 43:12.801
Quick, get in!

43:21.852 --> 43:25.606
Honey, this is gonna sound crazy

43:25.606 --> 43:28.358
and you're gonna think that I've
lost my mind, but I haven't, I swear.

43:28.358 --> 43:29.610
What the fuck is going on?

43:29.610 --> 43:31.612
Now, remember the night
at Ryan's celebration

43:31.612 --> 43:33.780
at the Village Tap when he won the Pavia?

43:33.780 --> 43:35.741
When I walked out the door that night,

43:35.741 --> 43:38.785
that was the last time
that I saw you until right now.

43:39.786 --> 43:40.871
Mom?

43:40.871 --> 43:43.457
The Jason that you're with,
he's an impostor.

43:43.457 --> 43:47.544
He built a box,
he has access to other realities.

43:47.544 --> 43:50.631
He stole me from this world
so he could have my fucking life.

43:50.631 --> 43:52.174
Pull over, please.

43:52.174 --> 43:53.675
It's insane, but I can prove it.

43:53.675 --> 43:54.760
Stop the car.

44:04.520 --> 44:07.397
Charlie. Charlie, are you okay?

44:08.106 --> 44:09.316
Yeah.

44:09.316 --> 44:10.943
We need to get out of here.

44:16.198 --> 44:17.449
- Daniela, it's me.
- Mom.

44:17.449 --> 44:18.617
- Charlie.
- Daniela.

44:18.617 --> 44:19.701
Charlie.

44:20.452 --> 44:23.038
- Daniela! Daniela!
- What the fuck is happening?

44:25.832 --> 44:28.418
Hey! Daniela!

44:31.839 --> 44:33.173
Daniela!

45:12.504 --> 45:13.547
Say it.

45:17.759 --> 45:18.927
Jupiter.

45:22.139 --> 45:23.140
Jupiter.
