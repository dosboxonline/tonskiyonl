00:04.379 --> 00:07.966
-ANNOUNCER:
Previously on Debris...
-GROHL: How's the family?

00:08.008 --> 00:09.718
MADDOX: What can I tell you?
It is what it is.

00:09.759 --> 00:11.594
-What are you doing?
-It's an unknown caller.

00:11.636 --> 00:13.096
JULIA:
Do I answer your phone?

00:13.138 --> 00:15.181
Not everything
is a conspiracy, Craig.

00:15.223 --> 00:16.933
FERRIS: We think
he's part of a group

00:16.975 --> 00:18.309
calling themselves Influx.

00:18.351 --> 00:19.769
They are actively
seeking Debris.

00:19.811 --> 00:23.189
It is more important now
than ever to show all cards.

00:23.231 --> 00:25.066
BRYAN: This is going to
affect Finola.

00:25.108 --> 00:27.360
We're just going to have to
sit on this for a little while.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.195
MADDOX:
I know you can handle it.

00:29.821 --> 00:32.240
BRYAN: But there
are things that I know

00:32.282 --> 00:34.200
that you will not
find very palatable.

00:34.242 --> 00:35.702
I need you to trust me.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.203
FERRIS:
It's your father.

00:37.245 --> 00:38.538
He may still be alive.

00:38.580 --> 00:40.040
We intercepted a communication

00:40.081 --> 00:41.583
that Bryan knows, too.

00:41.624 --> 00:43.460
FINOLA: We all deserve
to know the truth

00:43.501 --> 00:45.712
about what happens to
the people that we love.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.714
I'm not sure you'll
ever understand it.

00:55.764 --> 00:58.266
(indistinct chatter)

00:59.225 --> 01:01.603
DRIVER:
Next stop, Fourth Avenue.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.607
Excuse me.

01:06.816 --> 01:08.360
Excuse me.

01:08.401 --> 01:09.652
You dropped your glove.

01:11.029 --> 01:14.157
Oh. Would've been
the second pair
I lost in a month.

01:14.199 --> 01:15.909
I know what you mean.
I need the, uh,

01:15.950 --> 01:17.994
the strings on the mittens
like the kids have.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.413
Hey, those could work.
We could make those a thing.

01:20.455 --> 01:24.292
Dare to dream, right?
What a world that would be.

01:24.876 --> 01:27.712
(complete silence)

01:29.881 --> 01:32.842
(no audible dialogue)

01:43.978 --> 01:46.481
(crashing, metal twisting)

01:52.320 --> 01:55.031
(alert beeping)

01:55.073 --> 01:58.410
**

02:05.125 --> 02:07.544
(coughs)

02:19.848 --> 02:22.308
What... happened?

02:24.936 --> 02:26.646
Where am I?

02:31.026 --> 02:34.195
** (theme)

03:16.404 --> 03:18.239
(phone chimes)

03:20.325 --> 03:22.869
A new case file
just came in.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.499
May I see it?

03:30.001 --> 03:31.586
Please?

03:33.088 --> 03:35.048
Why? You don't read it.

03:35.090 --> 03:36.841
You glance at it and
you pretend you read it.

03:36.883 --> 03:39.719
-Someone doesn't like Mondays.
-It's Thursday.

03:39.761 --> 03:41.262
Then you're not
a morning person.

03:41.304 --> 03:43.223
It's 12 o'clock.

03:43.264 --> 03:44.933
Man, I'm messed up.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.936
That's the first thing
you've got right.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.732
(sighs)

03:59.614 --> 04:00.907
You're upset with me.

04:00.949 --> 04:03.159
You've been really quiet
since Nebraska.

04:03.201 --> 04:05.870
How would you know, Bryan?
You slept the whole way.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.790
I was making you think
I was sleeping.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.292
-It's training.
-Right.

04:12.252 --> 04:14.295
You're still upset.

04:15.338 --> 04:18.174
Okay. Just because
we disagreed

04:18.216 --> 04:19.759
about how to handle
the last case

04:19.801 --> 04:24.139
doesn't mean that there
has to be... a thing.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.434
Sometimes I'm going to go
against your logic

04:27.475 --> 04:29.477
and experience,
and depend on my own,

04:29.519 --> 04:31.688
Which is what you did.
That's fine.

04:31.730 --> 04:34.441
I don't want to
get into it, okay?

04:35.316 --> 04:36.735
It is what it is.

04:36.776 --> 04:40.447
We see things differently,
and it's okay.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.657
Seriously.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.745
I'm good.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.830
It's all good.

04:48.872 --> 04:50.373
Good.

05:07.390 --> 05:08.975
-Ahmed.
-Hey, Bryan.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.685
AHMED: Long time.
How you doing, man?

05:10.727 --> 05:12.312
-Finola Jones.
-FINOLA: Hey.

05:12.354 --> 05:14.814
Let me get you up to speed.
The bus was reported missing

05:14.856 --> 05:17.233
from Hackettstown, New Jersey
around 7:05 AM.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.818
How did it
end up here in Boston?

05:18.860 --> 05:20.695
From residual disturbances
in the atmosphere,

05:20.737 --> 05:22.364
we believe a piece of Debris

05:22.405 --> 05:25.325
caused a temporary deformation
in the topology of spacetime.

05:25.367 --> 05:27.410
It opened up a wormhole?

05:27.452 --> 05:28.953
Mackie's team is working
the Jersey side.

05:28.995 --> 05:30.663
We assume the Debris
was used there

05:30.705 --> 05:32.207
to get the bus here.

05:32.248 --> 05:33.416
FINOLA:
Any survivors?

05:33.458 --> 05:35.377
One, but he's gone.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.713
Looks like he dragged
himself to here.

05:39.547 --> 05:42.676
Okay.
He lost a lot of blood.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.678
He didn't get up
and walk away.

05:44.719 --> 05:47.097
Is there any camera work
or security footage?

05:47.138 --> 05:48.390
No.

05:48.431 --> 05:49.849
And did you check
the local hospitals?

05:49.891 --> 05:52.811
-Nothing so far.
-Well, he has to be somewhere.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.272
There was a piece
of Debris that they thought

05:56.314 --> 05:57.857
capable of doing
something like this.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.734
It was stolen from Germany
a few months back.

05:59.776 --> 06:01.569
FINOLA: Yeah, I remember
hearing about that.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.530
BRYAN: There was
intel on an event

06:03.571 --> 06:05.365
in China a little bit
after that.

06:05.407 --> 06:08.993
Whoever tried to
figure it out...
did not end well.

06:09.035 --> 06:12.872
Ended up coming out like long,
human strings of spaghetti.

06:12.914 --> 06:16.001
That was off the grid, though.
In a remote area.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.544
Why target a city bus?

06:17.585 --> 06:21.256
FINOLA: Something's changed
They're getting bolder now.

06:21.297 --> 06:23.633
(phone rings)

06:23.675 --> 06:25.135
Hey, it's Bryan.

06:27.721 --> 06:30.223
-I got stuff.
-Well, we need stuff.

06:30.265 --> 06:33.435
I picked up CCTV footage
to try track what
happened to the bus.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.437
Got it traveling down
Beatty Street.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.732
What we found is
pretty unbelievable.
Sending it to you now.

06:38.773 --> 06:40.942
-They're sending over
surveillance footage now.
-Okay.

06:40.984 --> 06:42.694
Do you guys have
the Debris on your end?

06:42.736 --> 06:44.362
Uh, no,
just faint signatures

06:44.404 --> 06:45.822
and atmospheric disruptions.

06:45.864 --> 06:47.574
We've interviewed
several people in the area

06:47.615 --> 06:49.743
who claimed to hear
a high-pitched whine

06:49.784 --> 06:51.369
two hours prior
to the event.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.912
-A whine?
-Yeah.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.622
People heard it
from three blocks around.

06:54.664 --> 06:56.583
-(phone chimes)
-I got it.

06:56.624 --> 06:58.626
It just came through.
Can you standby, please?

07:03.214 --> 07:06.801
FINOLA: Well, that's
the entry point right there.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.518
That's something.

07:17.645 --> 07:19.689
Maybe.
Note the time stamp.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.192
That guy leaves right
after the bus disappeared.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.318
Let me speak to Mackie.

07:24.611 --> 07:26.863
Hey, Mackie, there's a bank
across the street.

07:26.905 --> 07:29.157
Is there a coffee cup
on a concrete barrier?

07:29.199 --> 07:32.702
-Yeah.
-There's a possible suspect
in the CCTV footage

07:32.744 --> 07:35.497
who witnessed the event.
We want to find out who he is.

07:35.538 --> 07:38.291
Lift it for prints and then
we can run it through IAEFS.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.584
Thanks.

07:40.877 --> 07:44.255
Agent Jones.
We found the crash survivor.

07:49.302 --> 07:51.012
Thank you.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.938
FINOLA:
He's been shot.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.611
Syringe wrapper.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.868
Someone shot him
and took his blood?

08:17.080 --> 08:19.249
BRYAN:
And a skin biopsy.

08:22.877 --> 08:25.046
A sampling of his hair.

08:28.383 --> 08:29.718
What's going on here?

08:29.759 --> 08:33.013
Collecting DNA.
Maybe trying to figure out

08:33.054 --> 08:35.306
how messed up this guy got
going through a wormhole.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.975
Like, experimenting?

08:37.017 --> 08:38.643
Yeah.

08:39.811 --> 08:42.022
It has to be Influx.

08:42.063 --> 08:43.732
Who else could be
this organized?

08:44.733 --> 08:48.069
BRYAN: Let's get him back
to Orbital, do our own tests.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.238
FINOLA:
I'll arrange for transport.

08:52.365 --> 08:54.951
I assumed they were
trying to get Debris to sell...

08:54.993 --> 08:57.829
to countries, governments,
black market. Not to use.

08:57.871 --> 09:00.373
Well, they're definitely
interested in the results.

09:00.415 --> 09:01.624
Maybe it was a test.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.418
Test? For what?

09:03.460 --> 09:05.920
To prove that they can do it?
Maybe they just want to sell it.

09:06.755 --> 09:08.298
A demonstration
for a buyer.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.133
If they're the same ones
who stole it from Germany,

09:10.175 --> 09:11.968
they're getting better at it.

09:12.010 --> 09:14.387
These commuters didn't die
like they did in China.

09:14.429 --> 09:15.972
They've definitely
crossed a threshold

09:16.014 --> 09:17.807
in terms of their
understanding of it.

09:20.727 --> 09:23.772
Wait. I can't get
a hold of the footage.

09:23.813 --> 09:26.358
The piece that was
used in China.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.568
-It's not on the server.
-Let me see that.

09:28.610 --> 09:30.487
Any idea why
it was taken down?

09:30.528 --> 09:33.573
I don't know.
It was there.

09:33.615 --> 09:35.950
It's not a coincidence
that file's gone.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.161
I want to catch
these guys, Bryan.

09:38.203 --> 09:40.413
Yeah, so do I.
We will.

09:40.455 --> 09:43.083
And I'll ask Maddox about this
when I speak to him.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.627
Okay.

09:45.669 --> 09:47.796
AHMED: Hey.
Print results

09:47.837 --> 09:49.464
on the coffee cup
in Jersey.

09:49.506 --> 09:52.133
Guy is ex-paramilitary.
Peter Joseph Eickmann.

09:52.175 --> 09:56.596
Came in on a flight from
Germany to JFK yesterday morning

09:56.638 --> 09:58.098
on an EU passport.

09:58.139 --> 10:01.267
NSA flagged him.
He's on a few watch lists.

10:01.309 --> 10:04.229
CIA, MI6, Interpol.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.773
FINOLA: Let's go
find out what he knows.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.483
590-45.

10:08.525 --> 10:11.152
We're three minutes from
wheels up to New York City.

10:15.365 --> 10:18.118
This guy you're looking for,
he wasn't a guest?

10:18.159 --> 10:21.121
No, he was dropped off by cab
here yesterday morning.

10:21.162 --> 10:24.249
He met with a group
that checked into the hotel
using stolen credit cards.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.877
(keyboard clacking)

10:27.919 --> 10:29.421
MAN:
Uh, here we go.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.178
BRYAN: Hello.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.184
He seems to be the one
in control again, no?

10:44.185 --> 10:46.604
BRYAN: Sure would love
to find out who he is.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.565
FINOLA:
Can you rewind it?

10:48.606 --> 10:50.066
MAN: Sure.

10:51.359 --> 10:53.361
FINOLA: Freeze there.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.784
FERRIS:
I know you're upset--

10:59.826 --> 11:02.037
FINOLA: Ferris, these are
the men who took my father.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.122
FERRIS:
Are you absolutely sure?

11:04.164 --> 11:07.625
FINOLA: Yes, I literally
just saw them on video.
They were here.

11:07.667 --> 11:10.170
If we can stop this
and catch one of these guys,

11:10.211 --> 11:12.422
I can learn more about
what happened to him.

11:12.464 --> 11:14.924
You must be strong.

11:14.966 --> 11:17.218
The intel I'm expecting
about your father,

11:17.260 --> 11:19.346
-I've been told is promising.
-What does that mean?

11:19.387 --> 11:22.974
Ferris, you've gotta
give me something. Anything.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.809
I just want to know how--

11:24.851 --> 11:28.229
how he can possibly be alive
when I saw him dead.

11:28.271 --> 11:31.024
I know what I saw.
And it was him.

11:31.066 --> 11:32.984
We had clones in Pennsylvania.

11:33.026 --> 11:35.111
Could they have a piece
of Debris like that?

11:35.153 --> 11:37.155
I know their shelf lives
were short,

11:37.197 --> 11:39.908
but could Influx have found
some sort of way to just--

11:39.949 --> 11:42.660
FERRIS:
Finola... I don't know.

11:42.702 --> 11:46.081
When I learn something
concrete, so will you.

11:49.918 --> 11:52.712
This is a nightmare.

11:52.754 --> 11:55.048
This a bloody nightmare.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.425
(sighs)

11:57.467 --> 12:00.220
Bryan talked about
an event like this,

12:00.261 --> 12:02.514
a wormhole in China
where they were unsuccessful,

12:02.555 --> 12:04.391
but have now crossed
a threshold.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.267
They know how to do
things they couldn't do before,

12:06.309 --> 12:08.353
things they couldn't do
before they had my father.

12:08.395 --> 12:12.065
They are using him.
And now the case file
from China is gone.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.484
-I can't even access it.
-What do you mean?

12:14.526 --> 12:15.985
The Americans took it down.

12:16.027 --> 12:18.988
Can you see if you can get
the file and find out why?

12:21.074 --> 12:22.701
I've been denied here, too.

12:22.742 --> 12:24.869
Why do we even bother
with this alliance?

12:24.911 --> 12:26.913
This is pointless if
the U.S. is being dishonest.

12:26.955 --> 12:28.373
We're supposed to
be able to trust them.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.000
I'm supposed to be able
to trust Bryan.

12:30.041 --> 12:31.459
I just want to remind you,

12:31.501 --> 12:33.795
we have secrets
from the Americans, too.

12:33.837 --> 12:35.797
I'll look into this.

12:39.134 --> 12:41.803
Listen, I'm gonna have to go.
He's coming.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.348
BRYAN: You okay?

12:45.390 --> 12:47.225
Yeah. Just catching
Ferris up to speed.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.185
The rooms they were in
were clear, nothing here.

12:49.227 --> 12:50.645
It's as if they just--

12:50.687 --> 12:54.024
(loud high-pitched whine)

12:58.945 --> 13:01.031
This is the same sound
they heard in New Jersey.

13:04.868 --> 13:06.870
BRYAN:
It's gonna happen again.

13:12.834 --> 13:15.128
**

13:37.650 --> 13:39.944
JULIA: Do you want something to
eat before I go pick up Dario?

13:39.986 --> 13:43.073
MADDOX: No, thanks, babe.
I've gotta get back to work.

13:49.996 --> 13:53.917
You were quiet today.
You didn't share a lot.

13:55.877 --> 13:58.171
Sometimes I think she thinks
I share too much.

13:58.213 --> 14:00.840
-No.
-I think she thinks
I try to take over

14:00.882 --> 14:03.051
the sessions or something.

14:03.093 --> 14:05.929
I actually thought
you were quiet today.

14:06.888 --> 14:08.556
I want to move to Houston.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.394
You want to move to Houston.

14:12.435 --> 14:14.896
There's a facility,
The Goodson Clinic.

14:14.938 --> 14:16.523
They're doing excellent work.

14:16.564 --> 14:18.817
-We live here. I work here.
-(cell phone rings)

14:18.858 --> 14:20.777
Our whole life is here.

14:20.819 --> 14:23.571
We talked about that place,
like, seven years ago.

14:23.613 --> 14:25.573
I-I just want to
try something new.

14:25.615 --> 14:28.368
For who, for Dario?
Because that doesn't
make any sense.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.537
He's getting
the best care here.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.418
You can't do that.
You cannot do that.

14:36.459 --> 14:38.712
You cannot say that to me
and then-- and then shut down.

14:38.753 --> 14:41.214
We have to continue
talking about this.

14:41.256 --> 14:43.216
Susan just
told us this today.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.093
Yeah, I feel like
she's not on my side.

14:45.135 --> 14:49.973
I am on your side.
I have always been
on your side.

14:50.015 --> 14:52.058
Honey, that's why I go.

14:55.311 --> 14:58.690
I know how important
it is for you

14:58.732 --> 15:01.443
to control
the fate of the world,
what it takes from you.

15:01.484 --> 15:04.070
And I know how hard
it's been for you

15:04.112 --> 15:05.238
to accept
what happened to us...

15:05.280 --> 15:06.948
You cannot say
that to me anymore.

15:06.990 --> 15:08.491
...the things
you couldn't change,
after the accident--

15:08.533 --> 15:10.243
I am here now,
and I do accept it.

15:10.285 --> 15:12.412
I accept this,
I accept all of this.

15:12.454 --> 15:14.998
This is what we have.

15:15.040 --> 15:19.085
I love you, I love our son,
and I want us to be together.

15:19.127 --> 15:22.505
That's all I want, okay?

15:22.547 --> 15:25.008
(phone rings)

15:30.638 --> 15:32.057
Yeah.

15:32.098 --> 15:34.142
WOMAN: We have an incident
on the ground in New York.

15:34.184 --> 15:37.062
(whine continues)

15:39.606 --> 15:41.149
FINOLA: Anything?

15:41.191 --> 15:42.650
There's no point of origin.

15:42.692 --> 15:44.402
It's like it's
coming from everywhere.

15:44.444 --> 15:45.987
We've been taking readings,
trying to map it out.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.364
How large is it?

15:47.405 --> 15:49.741
Several blocks
in diameter.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.955
The previous event
in New Jersey,

15:55.997 --> 15:59.250
the sound zone was much smaller.
It was a block at most.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.461
This is going to be
a much larger wormhole.

16:01.503 --> 16:04.547
They're gonna make more than
just a city bus disappear.

16:04.589 --> 16:05.715
(whine stops)

16:07.092 --> 16:08.426
I can't hear it anymore.

16:08.468 --> 16:11.888
It stopped.
Everywhere.

16:11.930 --> 16:14.307
-How long do you think we have?
-Mackie said it was heard

16:14.349 --> 16:15.850
two hours before
it wound up in Boston.

16:15.892 --> 16:19.020
Well, that explains why Influx
is on the ground in numbers.

16:19.062 --> 16:22.565
Obviously, they're
the ones who stole this
piece from the Germans.

16:22.607 --> 16:24.693
There was a case file,
China, last month.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.653
It was taken down
off the servers.
Do you know why?

16:26.695 --> 16:28.655
No. I'm not sure why
it wouldn't be there.

16:28.697 --> 16:31.408
Wouldn't you have to approve
anyone taking it down?

16:31.449 --> 16:34.202
Typically, yes, but MI6
doesn't always follow protocol.

16:34.244 --> 16:36.746
I'll look into it.
I'm heading to you now.

16:36.788 --> 16:39.374
We need to stop this
event and catch these guys,

16:39.416 --> 16:42.752
and I want the first
crack at our British
friend when we do.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.462
Okay.

16:46.965 --> 16:49.509
I'm gonna put a team here,
and then one over there.

16:49.551 --> 16:51.594
Then I'll check in, okay?
Thank you.

16:54.723 --> 16:56.224
Did we find out
where it came from?

16:56.266 --> 16:57.892
No, they're still
searching the buildings.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.144
Base camp's over there.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.104
-Thanks.
-All right.

17:05.650 --> 17:08.153
(phone rings)

17:09.738 --> 17:12.115
(phone beeps)

17:17.412 --> 17:20.623
(phone rings)

17:22.125 --> 17:24.961
Hey, can I ring you later,
Dee Dee? Are you okay?

17:25.003 --> 17:27.756
DEE DEE:
Yeah, I just wanted to
ask you a question.

17:27.797 --> 17:29.591
I was just thinking
about that song.

17:29.632 --> 17:31.801
Do you remember that Spanish
song we used to sing?

17:31.843 --> 17:33.887
It's from, like,
a movie or something.
Do you remember it?

17:33.928 --> 17:35.472
Listen, I can't really
talk right now.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.349
Come on, just give me a sec.
What was it?

17:37.390 --> 17:39.768
Do you remember the name?
Fi, put me out of my misery.

17:39.809 --> 17:42.020
What was it?
What was it called?

17:42.062 --> 17:44.439
Where are you?

17:44.481 --> 17:47.901
Just outside...
the hospital.

17:47.942 --> 17:50.528
Justin got a little
carried away tonight.

17:51.404 --> 17:53.948
Well... is he okay?

17:53.990 --> 17:55.575
Yeah.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.370
What's going on?

17:59.412 --> 18:01.498
I just wanted to talk to you.

18:01.539 --> 18:04.501
I just wanted to
hear your voice, you know.

18:07.879 --> 18:09.923
I just feel so alone.

18:12.342 --> 18:16.179
Just felt good
when we listened to
that song, you know?

18:19.432 --> 18:23.103
Listen, Dee Dee,
I want you to go home. Okay?

18:23.144 --> 18:27.065
Get some sleep
and call me later.
All right?

18:27.107 --> 18:28.775
I really have to go,
but...

18:28.817 --> 18:33.738
please, just
go home and sleep.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.411
-Okay.
-I love you.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.454
I love you.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.875
(sighs)

18:56.803 --> 18:59.097
-Can I show you something?
-Yeah.

18:59.139 --> 19:00.849
The hotel manager
of this place

19:00.890 --> 19:02.767
said that only some of
the Influx Operatives
checked in.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.769
Yeah, they were at
full capacity.

19:04.811 --> 19:06.688
I think maybe some
of the others checked in
across the street.

19:06.730 --> 19:09.315
It's the only hotel for
the next six blocks.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.485
**

19:19.993 --> 19:21.619
BRYAN: Hey!

19:21.661 --> 19:22.871
Get down!

19:22.912 --> 19:24.539
Get on the ground!
Get on the ground!

19:24.581 --> 19:26.708
The gun!
Drop the gun!

19:27.417 --> 19:29.169
Nobody has to get shot.
Let's talk.

19:29.210 --> 19:30.628
You can't stop it.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.714
If we can just talk--

19:32.756 --> 19:33.757
No.

19:33.798 --> 19:35.633
Where is the sound coming from?

19:35.675 --> 19:37.552
Where is it coming from?

19:37.594 --> 19:40.680
Even if you stopped it...
you couldn't stop it.

19:40.722 --> 19:42.682
-What does that mean?
-Another will rise in my place.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.017
If you can just
help us stop--

19:44.059 --> 19:45.268
This technology will be free.

19:45.310 --> 19:46.519
FINOLA: No!

19:46.561 --> 19:47.771
(exhales sharply)

20:00.408 --> 20:03.453
-Hey.
-Hey.

20:03.495 --> 20:04.996
-Are you good?
-Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

20:05.038 --> 20:06.289
Where's Bryan?

20:06.331 --> 20:08.416
Over there,
talking to the coroner.

20:13.213 --> 20:15.382
Listen, whoever they are,
whatever their reasons,

20:15.423 --> 20:19.678
whatever they're doing,
they have enough conviction
to die for it.

20:19.719 --> 20:21.304
Did you learn anything?

20:21.346 --> 20:24.224
He said, "Another will
rise in my place.

20:24.265 --> 20:27.394
This technology will be free."
It is like they are zealots.

20:27.435 --> 20:30.855
Listen, you're gonna have to
get me this China file.

20:30.897 --> 20:32.816
There has to be something
on it that can help us

20:32.857 --> 20:34.984
stop them from opening up
another wormhole.

20:35.026 --> 20:36.194
It is all we have left.

20:36.236 --> 20:37.987
Literally, it is
all we have got.

20:38.029 --> 20:39.322
We do not have long,

20:39.364 --> 20:40.949
so if there's anything
that I can get--

20:40.990 --> 20:42.659
I have it.

20:42.701 --> 20:44.786
I couldn't risk sending it
over the network.

20:44.828 --> 20:46.871
It's on its way
to your location.

20:48.164 --> 20:49.541
What do you mean?

20:49.582 --> 20:51.626
Go to the intersection
of Varick and Moore.

20:51.668 --> 20:53.837
You're a block away.
Wait there.

21:21.156 --> 21:22.574
Ferris.

21:22.615 --> 21:25.535
She knows more than
she's telling you.

21:25.577 --> 21:27.871
Your father
is not a clone.

21:29.622 --> 21:30.999
Who are you?

21:32.417 --> 21:34.627
(engine revs)

21:57.150 --> 21:58.193
(door opens)

21:59.736 --> 22:01.821
BRYAN: Eickmann had
nothing on him.

22:01.863 --> 22:05.033
Still no idea
where Influx plans
to open the wormhole.

22:06.159 --> 22:07.619
What's that?

22:08.578 --> 22:10.372
The China footage.
Ferris found it.

22:10.413 --> 22:12.415
She managed to get it.

22:12.457 --> 22:16.127
Did you ask Maddox about it?

22:16.169 --> 22:17.921
I did. He was unaware.

22:17.962 --> 22:20.715
Said that the state department
pulled it down.

22:20.757 --> 22:22.634
China's too, uh,
hot right now,

22:22.676 --> 22:25.261
but he's working
on getting it back up.

22:25.303 --> 22:26.930
And you believe that?

22:26.971 --> 22:29.432
Why would he say it
if it wasn't true?

22:30.141 --> 22:32.727
Well, I just mean
I know there's a lot
of tension between,

22:32.769 --> 22:35.772
uh, China
and the U.S. right now.

22:35.814 --> 22:38.942
I'm just wondering
if there's, um,

22:38.983 --> 22:41.820
anything that
he's not telling you.

22:43.905 --> 22:45.573
No.

22:45.615 --> 22:47.992
He tells me everything.

22:53.039 --> 22:54.958
Yeah, well...

22:55.000 --> 22:56.292
Go teamwork.

22:56.334 --> 22:57.752
(keyboard clacking)

22:59.713 --> 23:02.674
There's nothing controversial
on here at all.

23:02.716 --> 23:05.510
It's exactly
as you described it.

23:07.512 --> 23:11.891
It says the excavators
were stolen from
a nearby construction site.

23:11.933 --> 23:14.060
Why did they need excavators?

23:14.894 --> 23:18.023
That's interesting.
They're facing each other.

23:18.940 --> 23:20.817
And the shovels are extended.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.488
What are you thinking?

23:25.530 --> 23:26.906
Wait a second...

23:26.948 --> 23:29.284
(keyboard clacking)

23:40.628 --> 23:42.339
That's how they're doing it.

23:42.380 --> 23:45.467
Yeah, we got scorch marks
and residue all over them.

23:45.508 --> 23:47.677
I've got two men
on the radio towers

23:47.719 --> 23:49.596
reporting back 120
on the Laghari.

23:49.637 --> 23:51.556
There was absolutely
Debris here.

23:51.598 --> 23:53.725
BRYAN: Okay, we'll call you
when we know more.

23:55.602 --> 23:56.644
You're right.

23:56.686 --> 23:58.229
(sighs)

23:58.271 --> 24:00.815
That's how they enabled the
Debris to pull the bus through.

24:00.857 --> 24:03.193
The wormhole
needs to be opened

24:03.234 --> 24:06.029
between two steel
conductive poles.

24:06.071 --> 24:08.281
And the whine we heard,
I think it was some kind of

24:08.323 --> 24:11.201
charging process,
almost like a tuning fork.

24:11.242 --> 24:14.412
Like the Debris was gathering
atmospheric electricity

24:14.454 --> 24:15.705
to power the event.

24:15.747 --> 24:17.749
So we're looking
for two tall,

24:17.791 --> 24:20.085
opposing vertical structures...

24:20.919 --> 24:23.296
in the middle
of Manhattan.

24:24.756 --> 24:27.759
You realize that's
the entire island, right?

24:33.431 --> 24:36.059
-What's the situation?
-We've got teams canvassing.

24:36.101 --> 24:38.269
Still no signs of Influx,
or any of the Debris.

24:38.311 --> 24:40.689
We're mapping all readings
and reports on
the sound disturbance.

24:40.730 --> 24:43.400
MALLORY: Agent Jones.
Sir.

24:43.441 --> 24:45.235
FINOLA:
So, for the size of the event
we're talking about,

24:45.276 --> 24:47.737
they'd want the largest solid
mass of steel they could get.

24:47.779 --> 24:50.448
MADDOX:
(sighs) If we don't find
the Debris they're using here,

24:50.490 --> 24:53.243
a big chunk of Manhattan is
going to literally disappear.

24:53.284 --> 24:55.662
There's got to be a way
to narrow this down.

24:56.830 --> 24:59.082
That one on Madison.

24:59.124 --> 25:01.292
I read an article about it.

25:01.334 --> 25:03.712
It was the first
skyscraper in Manhattan

25:03.753 --> 25:04.963
to have a tuned
mass damper on it.

25:05.005 --> 25:06.589
They're these
huge steel weights

25:06.631 --> 25:08.633
designed to stabilize tall
buildings against wind sway.

25:08.675 --> 25:11.970
All right, are there any
of these mass dampers
in the sound zone?

25:12.012 --> 25:14.139
Yeah, looks like
we've got two more.

25:14.180 --> 25:16.266
So they're going to use two
out of the three to open it up.

25:16.307 --> 25:17.934
We only need to find one,

25:17.976 --> 25:19.769
deactivate the Debris
so they won't sync.

25:19.811 --> 25:21.730
If we can do that,
we can stop the wormhole.

25:21.771 --> 25:23.773
All right, here's
what we're gonna do.
I'm gonna take a team to Park.

25:23.815 --> 25:25.608
Finola, you take
a team to Lexington.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.610
Bryan, you head to Madison.
All right?

25:27.652 --> 25:29.654
-Yeah.
-Yup. Thank you, Mallory.

25:30.238 --> 25:32.449
**

25:32.490 --> 25:35.326
(instrument beeping)

25:40.290 --> 25:44.002
The Debris is charged to 80%.
It won't be long.

26:06.232 --> 26:07.734
Clear.

26:17.911 --> 26:19.287
Shh.

26:26.002 --> 26:27.253
MAN: No signatures.

26:27.962 --> 26:30.256
MAN: Clear.

26:31.424 --> 26:33.093
Nothing here.
It must be with you guys.

26:33.134 --> 26:35.512
Repeat. Madison is clear.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.307
(elevator dings)

26:47.607 --> 26:49.359
(door opens in distance)

27:02.997 --> 27:04.165
Are you okay?

27:04.207 --> 27:06.584
Shots fired!
Agent down.

27:07.627 --> 27:09.963
Okay, take it down.
They're here.

27:12.465 --> 27:14.175
Let's go!

27:14.759 --> 27:16.886
(panting)

27:45.832 --> 27:47.167
They're in
the northeast stairwell.

27:47.208 --> 27:49.002
FINOLA:
54th floor.

27:49.836 --> 27:52.297
I think they've taken
the Debris with them.

28:09.731 --> 28:12.067
AGENT:
Laghari levels flat, sir.

28:13.526 --> 28:14.527
(phone rings)

28:15.320 --> 28:16.905
-Yeah.
-We're clear.

28:16.946 --> 28:18.156
Yours must be
the second building.

28:18.198 --> 28:19.699
That's impossible.

28:19.741 --> 28:21.201
We're not getting any
Laghari signatures.

28:21.242 --> 28:22.702
-It's not here.
-Negative.

28:22.744 --> 28:25.121
Finola's team confirmed
the other piece of Debris

28:25.163 --> 28:26.998
was taken from her location.

28:27.040 --> 28:28.416
Maybe we're not
getting the signatures

28:28.458 --> 28:30.126
because the pieces
aren't synced.

28:30.168 --> 28:31.711
It has to be you.

28:31.753 --> 28:33.380
Copy.

28:33.421 --> 28:35.674
Hey, Pete?
Something's not right.

28:35.715 --> 28:36.966
I'm gonna circle back.

28:37.884 --> 28:40.345
(instrument buzzing)

28:41.012 --> 28:42.305
It's down to 90%.

28:42.347 --> 28:44.015
As long as we stay
above 70, we're good.

28:44.057 --> 28:45.934
The charge will last
at least 15 minutes.

28:45.975 --> 28:47.894
I don't have enough time.

28:48.478 --> 28:49.896
Now you do.

28:50.730 --> 28:52.357
I've jumped too many times.

28:52.399 --> 28:55.610
Once more.
Think of the cause.

28:55.652 --> 28:57.904
It must be done.

29:04.786 --> 29:07.622
**

29:58.965 --> 30:00.967
We got one of them.
Dormant.

30:01.009 --> 30:03.470
MALLORY: I'll initiate
recovery protocols.

30:04.471 --> 30:05.680
Copy.

30:11.144 --> 30:12.479
Pete.

30:18.735 --> 30:20.028

30:20.653 --> 30:21.571

30:28.328 --> 30:30.121
-(phone rings)
-MADDOX: Yeah.

30:30.163 --> 30:32.290
Agents down, in need
of medical assistance.

30:32.332 --> 30:34.584
Roger that. We're
sending EMTs to your 20.

30:34.626 --> 30:36.169
We'll back up Finola.

30:36.211 --> 30:37.796
Help is on the way.
You're gonna be all right.

30:37.837 --> 30:40.590
You're gonna be okay.
Hey, look at me.

30:41.174 --> 30:43.677
Mallory, look at me.
I'm gonna stay
right here with you.

30:43.718 --> 30:46.346
You're gonna be okay.
All right?

30:50.600 --> 30:52.602
**

30:55.980 --> 30:58.525
MADDOX:
Finola, en route to you.
What's your 20?

31:00.360 --> 31:03.697
Finola? Finola?

31:21.047 --> 31:23.383
(groaning)

31:43.820 --> 31:46.197
I'm here. They're leaving.
I'm going in.

31:46.239 --> 31:49.075
**

31:55.373 --> 31:57.250

32:28.198 --> 32:30.617
(beeping)

32:33.078 --> 32:36.581
(Debris powering up)

32:41.461 --> 32:45.423
(Debris powering up)

32:49.052 --> 32:50.970
That doesn't make any sense.

32:51.012 --> 32:52.097
What?

32:52.138 --> 32:53.598
It's synced now.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.100
Somehow they've initiated it.

32:55.141 --> 32:57.185
It's going to happen.

33:16.079 --> 33:18.456
(panting)

33:29.509 --> 33:30.844
(Mallory gasping)

33:30.885 --> 33:33.221
Hold on. Hold on.

33:36.141 --> 33:38.601
Okay, careful.
You good?

33:38.643 --> 33:40.437
-(groans) Uh-huh.
-All right, stay with me.

33:41.438 --> 33:43.064
I'll walk you through
the sequence.

33:43.106 --> 33:46.359
N52 Disruption.
Simple stuff.

33:46.401 --> 33:49.070
Good, cause I've
never done one.

33:49.738 --> 33:53.616
I was joking.
Not easy. Very hard.

33:53.658 --> 33:55.952
I was hoping the joke
was the other way round.

33:57.704 --> 33:59.998
At least inside, you know
I'm smart enough to do it.

34:00.040 --> 34:03.168
Bryan, I've played
cards with you.

34:03.209 --> 34:05.545
I think you're lucky enough.
(panting)

34:06.421 --> 34:08.381
Start an AF ground sequence.

34:08.423 --> 34:10.050
AF ground sequence.

34:10.091 --> 34:11.634
(high-pitched whine)

34:11.676 --> 34:13.053
You're off on
the second parameter.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.554
That's way too high.

34:14.596 --> 34:16.639
(whine fades,
instrument beeping)

34:16.681 --> 34:18.892
-Next
-Lock it in.

34:18.933 --> 34:21.227
-Go back to the first node.
-I thought we always go

34:21.269 --> 34:22.729
one, two, three,
in that order.

34:22.771 --> 34:25.857
If you do, you'll be turned
into a fine yellow mist.

34:25.899 --> 34:27.400
I stand corrected.

34:31.237 --> 34:34.574
(panting)

34:54.969 --> 34:57.138
You've got his eyes.

34:57.180 --> 34:59.391
What've you done with him?

34:59.432 --> 35:01.309
Is he alive?

35:01.351 --> 35:02.560
Tell me what you've
done with him.

35:02.602 --> 35:05.397
-Tell me what--
-(complete silence)

35:22.747 --> 35:25.959

Debris powering down)

(sirens in distance)

35:43.560 --> 35:45.061
You all right?

35:45.103 --> 35:46.688
Yeah.

35:54.029 --> 35:55.321
(sighs)

35:55.363 --> 35:58.491
You did it, Mallory.
You did it.

35:58.533 --> 35:59.909
Help is on the way.

36:18.386 --> 36:20.680
We recovered
both pieces of Debris.

36:20.722 --> 36:22.599
I heard. Well done.

36:30.523 --> 36:33.068
Can't say I'm not
happy he's caught.

36:36.363 --> 36:38.490
But that was a risk.

36:40.408 --> 36:42.911
I wanted him alive.

36:45.747 --> 36:48.541
When I first met you,
I wondered about you.

36:49.250 --> 36:51.586
I doubted
you could do this job.

36:52.504 --> 36:54.547
I shouldn't have.

37:01.096 --> 37:02.597
Where is he?

37:02.639 --> 37:04.766
He's in
the transport truck.

37:07.310 --> 37:08.603
Where are they taking him?

37:10.105 --> 37:13.566
Somewhere where no one
will hear him scream.

37:17.779 --> 37:20.615
Well, I'm gonna go
finish the report.

37:20.657 --> 37:22.784
I'll see you
on the plane.

37:30.792 --> 37:32.419
MADDOX:
Finola, hey.

37:32.460 --> 37:34.796
How you doing?
You okay?

37:35.255 --> 37:36.923
-Yeah.
-Good.

37:36.965 --> 37:40.593
You did great.
Invaluable, really.

37:40.635 --> 37:44.139
This is gonna completely
open up Influx for us.

37:45.140 --> 37:49.269
Yeah, well, um,
I'm just, um, grateful

37:49.310 --> 37:52.105
that we were able to
stop what they were
attempting to do here.

37:52.147 --> 37:54.941
-The loss of life--
-It would have been
inconceivable.

37:54.983 --> 37:57.277
-Yeah.
-Let me ask you something.

37:57.318 --> 37:59.279
You were in contact with him

37:59.320 --> 38:00.780
just before agents
took him down.

38:00.822 --> 38:03.825
Did he...
say anything to you?

38:06.953 --> 38:08.580
No.

38:12.834 --> 38:15.587
Will I be able to
interview him?

38:15.628 --> 38:17.797
I want to get
the lay of the land first.

38:18.923 --> 38:23.011
Trust me, I will get
what I need out of him.

38:23.053 --> 38:26.139
And I'll personally let you
know what I find out, okay?

38:27.932 --> 38:30.727
-Yeah. I appreciate that.
-(phone rings)

38:30.769 --> 38:33.938
Oh, I gotta go.
Yep, I'm on my way now.

to fill up on sweets.

Finola is, too.

take it away from her.
