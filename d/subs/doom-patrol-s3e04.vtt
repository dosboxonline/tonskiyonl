or does someone need to jam
a foot up your pee-hole?

04:16.923 --> 04:22.161
Oh! Aren't you charming?
Now, would you mind telling me,

04:22.262 --> 04:24.797
when are you expecting
Niles Caulder back?

04:24.897 --> 04:26.633
-Well--
-Look, lady.

-You're in our house...
-Mmm-hmm.

-...wearing our clothes
and drinking our tea.
-Yeah.

04:30.336 --> 04:32.739
Now, answer our questions.

04:32.805 --> 04:34.941
Then maybe we could
talk about Niles.

-How were you made?
-Excuse me?

04:39.312 --> 04:42.849

Uh, that is his face.

04:44.851 --> 04:47.487
That is his face!
Wow, okay.

04:47.587 --> 04:50.690
-Stop doing that!
-Okay, in a minute. Whoa!

04:50.790 --> 04:53.860
-It's fascinating.
-How long have you been
in our house?

04:53.960 --> 04:55.695
Well, long enough
to see Bandages over here

-[Jane] No!
-[Cliff] The fuck?

04:59.832 --> 05:04.037
[Larry] I was at a low point
and wasn't making
great decisions, okay?

05:04.137 --> 05:08.708
Okay, tell me, why are you all
scratching like circus animals?

05:08.808 --> 05:12.145

dragging your ass out of here.

05:12.211 --> 05:15.048
Okay, well...
I'm not being coy. Um...

05:15.148 --> 05:18.051

I can't remember.

-Why are you looking for Chief?
-Can't remember that either.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.055
But when I think of him,

05:22.155 --> 05:25.124
I am filled with
an overwhelming
and immediate urge

05:25.191 --> 05:26.893
to punch him in the face.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.127
-That's him.
-Yup.

05:28.194 --> 05:29.162
-Word.
-Sounds about right.

05:29.228 --> 05:31.064
But here's what I do know.

05:31.164 --> 05:34.834
I seem to have traveled here
via a sort of
a time-travel capsule.

05:34.901 --> 05:36.836
[Larry] Ugh...

05:36.903 --> 05:40.006
As a result, I have a moderate
to more-than-moderate degree
of memory loss.

05:40.073 --> 05:43.576
And that I need to find
a certain Niles Caulder.

05:43.676 --> 05:44.911

05:45.011 --> 05:46.979

as time travel.

a certain sixth grade assbag
named Jimmy Decker

05:50.817 --> 05:53.353
would've never pulled
my pants down in assembly.

05:53.419 --> 05:56.923
And I never would've had
the nickname "Cheeto Dick"
for six years.

That's what you would
go back in time and fix?

05:59.092 --> 06:04.897
Fuck yeah! But like I said,
time travel doesn't exist.

06:18.111 --> 06:19.245
You were saying?

06:21.914 --> 06:23.683

did you come from?

06:23.750 --> 06:25.585
Um... [chuckles]

06:32.592 --> 06:35.962
If you saw us dead,
that means that you were here
at least since yesterday.

06:36.062 --> 06:37.430
-Hey, Rita?
-Hmm?

06:37.530 --> 06:39.532
When did your super-secret
alarm thing go off?

06:39.599 --> 06:44.070
Uh, the day before we went to
Codsville, I think, ahem.
[clears throat]

06:44.137 --> 06:46.305
[Larry] Which you
completely ignored.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.575

Oh, shut up.

06:49.642 --> 06:51.544
She's here now,
isn't she?

06:51.611 --> 06:54.414
Right, yes. And now
it's time for you all
to answer my questions,

06:54.480 --> 06:56.716
starting with,
"Where is Niles Caulder?"

06:56.783 --> 07:01.087

07:09.962 --> 07:11.297
Two weeks. Right.

07:11.397 --> 07:12.999
Well, then I shall just
time-travel back to then.

07:13.099 --> 07:17.136
[Jane] Then. You can do that?
And actually talk to him?

07:17.236 --> 07:20.440
[woman]
It's a time machine, dear.
So I can, you know, travel back

07:20.506 --> 07:23.276
and have a wee chat
with Adam and Eve,
if I want to.

07:25.445 --> 07:29.816
[Cliff] Mmm, I don't know.
Things were a little hairy
around here two weeks ago.

07:29.916 --> 07:34.120
Kaiju candle-demon on
the loose. You might wanna
go back a little further.

07:34.187 --> 07:37.190
Right. Well, I shall
go back three weeks, then.

07:37.290 --> 07:39.125
Ooh, yeah.

07:39.192 --> 07:42.662
This place was lousy
with sex ghosts around then.
I don't recommend it.

07:42.762 --> 07:43.996
-True.
-[Cliff] That's right.

07:44.096 --> 07:46.632
-Well, four weeks?
-[all] No, no, no.

07:46.699 --> 07:48.301
Okay. Well, how about five?

07:48.367 --> 07:49.602
-[Vic] Hell, no.
-[others groan]

07:49.669 --> 07:51.037
Seven? What about seven?
Give me seven.

07:51.137 --> 07:53.005
Anyone for seven?
You want to give me seven?

07:53.105 --> 07:54.540
-Seven, anybody?
-I think you're good.

07:54.640 --> 07:57.109
Good, all righty.
Bon voyage!

07:57.176 --> 07:58.878
Send Chief our love.

07:58.978 --> 08:02.949
Tell him I said...
He'll know what it means.

08:03.015 --> 08:08.554
Okay, well, this is goodbye
and has been a truly
infuriating experience.

08:08.654 --> 08:13.392
And I only hope that
in your time of need,
you will be met one day

08:13.493 --> 08:18.564
with the same ineptitude
and uselessness which
you have shown me here today.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.234
So, I bid you adieu.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.903
-[door creaking shut]

08:43.356 --> 08:46.058

existed ten minutes ago.

08:46.158 --> 08:46.993
Mmm-hmm.

08:47.727 --> 08:49.929
Oh! Thank you.

08:50.029 --> 08:51.264
I can't fix your machine.

08:51.364 --> 08:54.734
No. Well, not with
that attitude, you can't.

08:54.834 --> 08:55.768
What about Cliff?

08:55.868 --> 08:57.069
[squeaking]

08:57.169 --> 08:59.338
He knows everything
about fixing cars.

08:59.405 --> 09:03.576
Oh, I know more than
everything. Thing is, I don't
give a shit about any of this.

09:03.676 --> 09:06.612
So you kids have a party.
I'm out of here.

09:06.712 --> 09:10.082
Wait. We're just gonna
let some crazy lady
stay in our house

09:10.182 --> 09:12.585
and put her crazy lady fingers
on all our stuff?

09:12.685 --> 09:16.556
Because there's nothing weird
about some nutball
traveling through time

09:16.622 --> 09:17.957
to see Chief?

09:18.057 --> 09:19.792
-[Cliff] Yup.
-[Larry] Pretty much, yeah.

09:19.892 --> 09:22.261
We've got our own crap
to take care of, remember?

09:22.361 --> 09:26.032
We agreed to get help
with our shit?

09:27.567 --> 09:32.038
-You were serious about that?
-Yup. You should be too.

09:32.104 --> 09:35.241
Well, you should
mind your own fucking business.

09:37.243 --> 09:40.646
Okay, right. Um, you.
Take me to this secret alarm.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.315
I would like to
have a look at it.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.817
-I would be happy--
-No.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.419
[Larry grunting] Oh, God.

09:46.485 --> 09:47.453

09:47.553 --> 09:48.454
Oh, God!

09:48.554 --> 09:49.722
[gasping]

09:49.789 --> 09:50.890
Shall we?

09:52.391 --> 09:54.927
Okay. Well, I'll be back to
check on your work later.

09:54.994 --> 09:55.962
Oh, I'm not...

10:03.002 --> 10:04.236
[coughing, vomiting]

10:15.114 --> 10:16.015
Oh, God.

10:18.584 --> 10:21.187
Oh, God.

10:21.287 --> 10:23.356
Well, first, my leg
started fucking up.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.958
Then my hands started
shaking like fucking Jell-O.

10:26.025 --> 10:28.527
I thought that it was just
shitty craftsmanship

10:28.628 --> 10:30.529
by the shitty scientist
that built my body.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.032
But then my buddy Cyborg
scanned my shit and said

10:33.132 --> 10:34.867
it might be my brain
that's fucked.

10:34.967 --> 10:37.603
Cyborg's not really my buddy.
I don't know why
I just said that.

10:37.670 --> 10:39.672
He's more like this
lesser version of me
who lives in my house.

10:39.772 --> 10:42.608
Anyhoo, my daughter-in-law
thinks I might have
Parkinson's.

10:42.675 --> 10:45.378
But she's not a doctor.
She's a graphic designer.

10:45.478 --> 10:48.114
But you're a doctor.
So what do you think?

10:52.184 --> 10:54.487
Goddamn TikTokers.
I don't have time for this.

10:55.688 --> 10:56.689
Hmph, okay.

11:15.074 --> 11:15.975
Fuck it.

11:19.245 --> 11:20.379
[fly buzzing]

11:34.326 --> 11:35.394
[loud clattering]

11:35.494 --> 11:36.395
Shit!

11:39.031 --> 11:39.899
[flesh tearing]

11:39.999 --> 11:42.535
What the hell?

11:42.601 --> 11:45.771
[Silas] Which of Niles'
nonsense are you
mixed up in now?

11:46.706 --> 11:48.274
[Vic] It's a time machine.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.710
And for some reason,
I've been tasked
with fixing it.

11:50.776 --> 11:53.179
Also, it's not Niles.

11:53.245 --> 11:55.014
I hope you didn't
ask me here to help.

11:55.081 --> 11:58.517
Time travel's fringe,
experimental, dangerous.

11:58.584 --> 12:02.221
Few human trials that I know of
have led to neurological damage
and memory loss.

12:02.288 --> 12:06.459
Fringe and experimental?
As opposed to the body tech
which was thoroughly vetted

12:06.559 --> 12:08.294
before you put it in my body?

12:08.394 --> 12:09.862
I did it to save your life.

12:09.929 --> 12:12.031
And if I'm not mistaken,
it seems to have
worked out okay.

12:12.098 --> 12:14.934
Alive and okay
aren't the same thing.
You know that, right?

12:15.034 --> 12:17.970
Maybe you'd have
more body positivity
if you'd made better choices

12:18.070 --> 12:19.538
for how you used your tech--

12:19.605 --> 12:21.474
I didn't choose
to put this in my body.
You did.

12:22.641 --> 12:24.376
What's going on here, Vic?

12:24.443 --> 12:25.978
Where's this coming from?

12:26.078 --> 12:28.080
I've just been
wondering, is all,

12:28.147 --> 12:32.451
if there was another choice,
if body tech was the only way
to save my life.

12:36.088 --> 12:39.892
Okay, let's talk about choice.

12:39.959 --> 12:42.828
Like your choice
to abet Roni Evers
in evading authorities,

12:42.928 --> 12:44.997
a choice that cost me my job.

12:45.097 --> 12:45.998
What?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.668
Technically, I'm on
administrative leave.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.504
-But it's not looking good.
-But that's not fair!

12:51.604 --> 12:53.172
You had nothing to do with.

12:53.272 --> 12:55.841
You used S.T.A.R. Labs tech
I designed to help a murderer!

12:55.941 --> 12:58.144
But she's not
a bad person, Dad!

12:58.244 --> 13:01.781
If you know what she
went through, you'd understand
where she's coming from.

13:01.847 --> 13:04.483
She deserved a second chance,
and I gave her one.

13:08.654 --> 13:09.922
So that's it?

13:09.989 --> 13:12.925
You take zero responsibility
for your actions?

13:12.992 --> 13:15.494
I can't believe I'd ever feel
this disappointed in you, son.

13:16.929 --> 13:17.830
But here we are.

13:18.631 --> 13:19.765
[sighs]

13:21.801 --> 13:23.769
Do you want to know
why I asked you over?

13:26.672 --> 13:28.040
Two days ago, I died.

13:28.607 --> 13:29.875
What?

13:29.975 --> 13:31.677
I went to the afterlife
and I talked to Mom.

13:31.777 --> 13:33.345
[softly] Oh...

13:33.445 --> 13:35.214
Finally happened.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.349
You've been hanging around
these nuts so long,
you done lost your mind.

13:37.449 --> 13:39.852
No. She told me that
there was another way
you could have saved me.

13:39.952 --> 13:43.022
Yeah. And I want to know
what it was.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.392
Was there another way or not?

13:49.528 --> 13:50.496
Well...

13:51.664 --> 13:54.867
We had, uh,
developed a prototype

13:56.202 --> 13:57.236
for synthetic skin.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.737
[whispering] Oh, God.

14:00.372 --> 14:03.142
So, I could've looked normal.

14:03.209 --> 14:05.511
-It was still very--
-Experimental.

14:06.846 --> 14:08.414
Like the cyber tech?

14:08.514 --> 14:09.481
Just like this?

14:10.816 --> 14:12.585
Why would you do this to me?

14:12.685 --> 14:17.489
You couldn't do human trials,
so you used your own son
as a guinea pig?

14:17.556 --> 14:18.691
Is that what this is?

14:18.757 --> 14:21.660
I cannot keep
explaining myself.

14:21.727 --> 14:22.862
You can't or you won't?

14:22.928 --> 14:26.999
Everything I did
was to protect you.

14:27.066 --> 14:29.935
I don't care what you hear
or who you talk to.

14:31.570 --> 14:32.938
It won't change that.

14:41.947 --> 14:43.115
[tool clatters loudly]

14:45.551 --> 14:49.688
I must apologize
for my housemates'
less-than-warm welcome.

14:49.755 --> 14:53.959
It's just, most of them
are trying to move on
from Niles Caulder,

14:54.059 --> 14:58.564
so a mysterious stranger
dredging him back up
was probably a bit triggering.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.299
Oh, yeah? Why is that?

15:00.399 --> 15:01.967
Was he a bad man?

15:02.067 --> 15:03.469
Yes.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.603
And no.

15:06.205 --> 15:07.907
He was a complicated person.

15:07.973 --> 15:09.608
Yes. Well, aren't we all?

15:12.077 --> 15:14.980
Oh, shitting hell!

15:15.080 --> 15:17.616
Perhaps it was
completely pointless
coming here.

15:17.716 --> 15:20.619
Well, how can you possibly
know what to look for

15:20.719 --> 15:22.154
when you don't know
what you're looking for?

15:22.254 --> 15:25.758
Well, the mind may forget,
but the gut may not.

15:25.824 --> 15:27.893
It is the elephant of the body,

15:27.960 --> 15:32.164
and it will tell me
when I am onto something.

15:32.264 --> 15:35.834
It just occurred to me
that I... I don't know
what to call you.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.236
Well, that makes two of us.

15:38.904 --> 15:40.806
What about Shannon?

15:40.906 --> 15:43.108
I have always liked that name.

15:43.175 --> 15:45.577
Very well, Shannon it is.

15:45.644 --> 15:48.747
Why don't you tell me,
um, what your name is?

15:48.814 --> 15:51.183
It's Rita. Rita Farr.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.152
Ah, well, Rita.

15:53.252 --> 15:56.622
I don't know why you have
attached yourself to me
like a black-legged tick,

15:56.689 --> 15:59.358
but it is distracting
and quite bothersome.

15:59.458 --> 16:03.762
And I don't mean to be unkind,
but it's really annoying!

16:03.829 --> 16:06.932
Oh, I didn't mean to be
any of those things.

16:06.999 --> 16:08.500
Do you have a question for me,

16:08.600 --> 16:13.038
or is your neediness some
kind of holistic condition?

16:13.138 --> 16:15.040
Actually, I do.

16:15.140 --> 16:16.875
Do I look at all
familiar to you?

16:16.976 --> 16:21.380
My body elephant
has the strongest feeling
that we know each other.

16:21.480 --> 16:24.483
No one looks familiar to me,
not even me.

16:24.550 --> 16:27.319
Or do you...
Do you not know
how amnesia works?

16:27.386 --> 16:33.025
Maybe try taking
a nice long look
at me for a minute.

16:33.125 --> 16:36.495
Maybe it'll help
jog something loose.
Hmm?

16:44.970 --> 16:48.540
Oh, you got schmutz
on your face there.

16:48.640 --> 16:49.675
[groans]

16:52.544 --> 16:53.879
Ah!

17:00.753 --> 17:02.221
Hot dog!

17:07.893 --> 17:09.762
[creaking]

17:13.499 --> 17:14.400
Okay.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.371
[both gasp]

17:24.676 --> 17:26.745
[exhales] That's the stuff.

17:31.083 --> 17:32.017
Wow.

17:34.420 --> 17:35.454
Ugh!

17:39.625 --> 17:41.293
[Cliff] Whatcha doing?

17:41.393 --> 17:43.796
Playing Frisbee golf.
What does it
look like, dipshit?

17:43.896 --> 17:45.964
Uh...

17:46.065 --> 17:48.567
Like you're making
creepy Bob Ross fan art.

17:48.634 --> 17:51.470
You made me feel like shit
for not honoring
our stupid pact or whatever,

17:51.570 --> 17:56.041
so I tried making something
out of my pain,
like<i> Abuelita</i> told me to.

17:56.108 --> 17:57.376
But it didn't work.

17:57.443 --> 17:59.378
And now I feel like
an even bigger dick,

17:59.445 --> 18:03.949
so I'm going to get
high as fuck
and then light it on fire.

18:04.049 --> 18:06.418
-Wanna watch?
-Definitely.

18:06.485 --> 18:10.656
Only... maybe before
you flick your Bic,

18:10.756 --> 18:15.060
you might wanna, I don't know,
try talking to creepy Bob Ross.

18:15.127 --> 18:17.329
-About what?
-Whatever you want.

18:17.429 --> 18:21.166
Maybe saying some shit you
didn't get to before he died
will give you some closure.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.802
Who crawled up your ass
and made you Dr. Phil?

18:23.902 --> 18:27.172
When we were in the afterlife,
I got to tell off
my asshole dad,

18:27.272 --> 18:28.841
and it felt awesome!

18:28.941 --> 18:32.678
I'm talking top ten
best moments of my life,
or afterlife.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.813
At least it was great
till he shoved his

18:34.913 --> 18:36.982
"Grandpa of the Year" mug
up my butt.

18:37.683 --> 18:39.118
Not literally.

18:39.184 --> 18:42.521
And I got to tell Niles
to suck a bucket of vaginas,

18:42.621 --> 18:45.023
which also squeaks
into my top ten.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.325
Wait, when did that happen?

18:46.425 --> 18:47.693
Oh, uh...

18:47.793 --> 18:49.928
Probably about, ooh,
sometime after he died.

18:49.995 --> 18:53.866
He was a ghost, and he
wanted me to burn his body
so his soul could be at peace.

18:53.966 --> 18:56.468
But I didn't do it
because fuck him.

18:56.535 --> 18:57.836
So I could've
talked to him?

18:57.936 --> 19:00.305
That's what I'm saying!
You still can.

19:12.017 --> 19:14.653
[Larry] I'm sorry it has
to end this way, old friends.

19:16.121 --> 19:18.857
I'd like to think
you'll do well out here.

19:18.957 --> 19:21.527
But my guess is, you'll be dead
a week after I am.

19:21.627 --> 19:23.061
[Rita groans]

19:23.162 --> 19:25.797
I'm in crisis, Larry,
and I need a sympathetic ear.

19:25.864 --> 19:28.233
Uh, not really
a good time, okay?

19:28.333 --> 19:30.335
There was another me
at Codsville.

19:31.303 --> 19:32.371
[Larry sighs]

19:33.672 --> 19:35.374
How do you mean?

19:35.474 --> 19:38.977
I mean, there was another me.
As in, instead of
just one of me,

19:39.044 --> 19:40.746
there were two.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.749
It happened right after that
ghastly red creature
started shooting.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.251
I almost escaped, when "she"

19:46.351 --> 19:49.421
shoved me back
into the lounge.

19:49.521 --> 19:52.157
What's more is,
she was wearing
the exact same flight suit

19:52.224 --> 19:53.992
I found in Shannon's
time machine.

19:54.059 --> 19:57.429
-Who's Shannon?
-Our mysterious time traveler.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.597
It's what
we're calling her now.

19:58.697 --> 19:59.932
She remembered her name?

20:00.032 --> 20:01.900
No. It's just
what we're calling her.

20:02.000 --> 20:03.602
Please, Larry,
try to stay focused.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.270
-[sighs]
-And if that weren't enough,

20:05.370 --> 20:07.539
there's that strange creature
in the afterlife

20:07.606 --> 20:10.842
who not only seemed to know me,
but to like me.

20:10.909 --> 20:15.280
But I couldn't get any answers
or even a little common
courtesy out of Shannon,

20:15.380 --> 20:19.251
so I am left
to put the pieces together
on my own.

20:19.351 --> 20:22.287
But what does it all mean?

20:22.387 --> 20:25.023
I mean, the two seem
unrelated to me.

20:26.925 --> 20:28.694
Ha! Larry...

20:28.760 --> 20:32.297
What if I'm a world-renowned
time traveler?

20:34.366 --> 20:35.567
Uh, look,

20:35.634 --> 20:37.469
after all the weird crap
we've been through,

20:37.569 --> 20:39.571
I can buy
the time traveler piece.

20:39.638 --> 20:41.573
But where do you get
"world-renowned"?

20:41.640 --> 20:46.044
Since I am one of two
known time travelers,

20:46.111 --> 20:48.547
one could extrapolate
my elevated status.

20:48.614 --> 20:50.082
Or maybe
you're trying to find

20:50.148 --> 20:53.118
some specialness inside you
that isn't really there.

20:56.989 --> 20:58.657
Now, how could you
say that to me?

21:00.225 --> 21:01.493
[Larry sighs]

21:04.997 --> 21:06.765
I'm dying, Rita.

21:09.268 --> 21:11.236
-Again?
-Yeah.

21:11.303 --> 21:12.771
What's happening?

21:12.838 --> 21:15.574
I've been puking up
blue crap all morning.

21:15.641 --> 21:16.842
Since I don't eat or drink,

21:16.942 --> 21:18.477
I don't think
that's a good sign.

21:19.511 --> 21:21.113
Oh, Larry.

21:21.179 --> 21:24.082
Yeah, apparently,
life without the spirit
has its limits.

21:24.149 --> 21:26.985
I think that's why
he brought me into space,

21:27.085 --> 21:28.920
so I could see it
one last time.

21:30.522 --> 21:31.356
Anyway.

21:33.792 --> 21:37.496
I love you too much
to not be honest
during my last days.

21:41.199 --> 21:43.769
Now, you see here,
Larry Trainor, I...

21:45.003 --> 21:46.538
What's on your bandages?

21:52.377 --> 21:54.012
-[inhaling deeply]
-[Larry] Ugh!

21:54.112 --> 21:56.848
What fresh hell is this? Oh!

21:56.948 --> 22:01.386
You know,
you... smell delicious.

22:01.486 --> 22:04.556
Do you have ham in your pocket
or something?

22:04.656 --> 22:06.992
Um, not that I'm aware of, no.

22:08.827 --> 22:13.332
-[gasps]
-Uh... Did, um...
Did you just lick me?

22:16.635 --> 22:18.737
Oh, I...
I have no idea.

22:21.740 --> 22:23.008
[whirring]

22:25.377 --> 22:27.512
[Shannon reading]

22:30.682 --> 22:32.751
Doesn't ring a bell.

22:32.851 --> 22:35.153
"Woman petting cat."

22:36.154 --> 22:36.988
Well?

22:42.527 --> 22:45.097
[reading]

22:48.900 --> 22:50.369
Not a flicker.

22:55.173 --> 22:56.274
[sighs]

22:57.209 --> 22:58.410
[cranking]

23:00.712 --> 23:02.748
[clicking]

23:16.361 --> 23:17.195
[gagging]

23:23.301 --> 23:24.202
[scratching]

23:36.281 --> 23:37.215
[screaming]

23:38.650 --> 23:40.118
Larry!

23:40.752 --> 23:41.753
Rita... [groans]

23:42.587 --> 23:44.322
[grunting]

24:29.134 --> 24:30.168
[gasping]

24:33.672 --> 24:35.173
My body elephant!

24:36.975 --> 24:40.378
[Cliff] I'm telling you,
this is that crazy spider
lady's puke or something.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.047
It's like a curse!

24:42.147 --> 24:43.181
[sneezing]

24:43.281 --> 24:45.717
Bless you. Oh, my fuck!

24:49.354 --> 24:50.388
[groans]

24:52.657 --> 24:53.892
I don't feel so good.

24:53.992 --> 24:55.627
You don't look great either.

24:56.728 --> 24:58.630
Jane? Jane?

25:00.665 --> 25:02.534
[Cliff roars]

25:10.342 --> 25:11.743
Oh!

25:13.845 --> 25:14.813
[grunting]

25:17.549 --> 25:18.917
[bones cracking]

25:20.819 --> 25:22.187
[grunts, neck cracks]

25:28.527 --> 25:30.095
[breathing heavily]

25:35.200 --> 25:36.434
[gasps]

25:52.684 --> 25:53.885
Oh.

25:56.788 --> 25:58.790
[laughing]

25:58.890 --> 26:03.028
Oh. [exhales] Everybody...

26:03.094 --> 26:06.364
Everybody, come,
I know who I am!

26:06.431 --> 26:08.133
I'm a bird!

26:08.233 --> 26:10.869
And I can fly... I think.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.607
[all] Brains!

26:16.274 --> 26:17.876
Brains!

26:19.811 --> 26:21.379
[doorbell ringing]

26:21.446 --> 26:23.982
[door opens, closes]

26:24.082 --> 26:25.250
[footsteps approaching]

26:26.818 --> 26:28.219
[all] Brains?

26:32.123 --> 26:34.259
What happened
to you morons this time?

26:34.326 --> 26:37.729
[all] Brains.

26:39.998 --> 26:41.666
Are you the one
who zombified these tits?

26:41.766 --> 26:44.903
I don't think so. [mumbles]
I couldn't swear to it, though.

26:44.970 --> 26:46.237
-Who's she?
-[speaking zombie]

26:55.947 --> 26:59.417
Uh-huh. Okay.
Um, could somebody tell me
what's going on here?

26:59.484 --> 27:02.120
-'Cause I'm...
-What happened to you lot?

27:02.187 --> 27:03.121
[Cliff speaking zombie]

27:14.833 --> 27:18.036
Sure thing. I need an axe,
gallon of petrol and a match.

27:18.136 --> 27:19.037
[Larry speaking zombie]

27:21.473 --> 27:23.041
Got it in one, Bubba Ho-tep.

27:23.875 --> 27:24.876
[neck cracks]

45:10.274 --> 45:12.910
The one upside
to being a zombie was

45:13.010 --> 45:16.113
the only thing
I worried about
was finding brains.

45:18.182 --> 45:21.552
It was sort of,
I don't know, peaceful.

45:23.120 --> 45:24.455
Anyone feel like that?

45:27.224 --> 45:29.126
Okay, just throwing it
out there.

45:33.597 --> 45:34.698
[Laura sighs]

45:34.765 --> 45:37.735
"Laura De Mille is a disloyal

45:37.801 --> 45:41.572
and self-serving cancer
to be excised.

45:43.407 --> 45:46.143
It is my strong recommendation

45:48.979 --> 45:51.315
that she be
terminated immediately."

46:35.659 --> 46:36.827
[chuckles]

46:41.965 --> 46:44.001
"Eat me." [laughs]

46:48.472 --> 46:49.673
"Eat me!"

47:05.689 --> 47:06.857
What's this?

47:06.957 --> 47:08.625
Online pharmacy?

47:10.527 --> 47:12.396
No prescription necessary.

47:13.163 --> 47:14.331
Fuck yeah!

47:14.898 --> 47:16.033
[chimes]

47:27.845 --> 47:29.012
What the hell?

47:42.359 --> 47:43.760
My God!

47:45.696 --> 47:47.197
[gags]

47:53.237 --> 47:54.238
God!

47:56.006 --> 47:57.007
[sighs]

47:58.942 --> 48:00.077
Oh, shit.

48:01.044 --> 48:02.079
[sighs]

48:33.610 --> 48:35.646
So, what happened
with Niles?

48:35.746 --> 48:38.615
Did he give you the answers
you were looking for?

48:38.715 --> 48:41.818
Will you be leaving us soon?

48:43.887 --> 48:45.489
Ugh, now see here, you.

48:45.589 --> 48:47.090
You are a guest in our home.

48:47.157 --> 48:50.260
And though you did help
save our bacon...

48:50.327 --> 48:53.997
[sighs] it doesn't
give you the right
to ignore my questions.

48:54.097 --> 48:56.934
We know each other.
I am certain of it and...

48:59.603 --> 49:00.737
[sobs]

49:03.173 --> 49:05.008
Perhaps this isn't a good time.

49:08.745 --> 49:12.516
Oh. I just made
some oatmeal cookies.

49:13.784 --> 49:14.985
Would you like one?

49:17.354 --> 49:18.622
That would be nice.

49:20.457 --> 49:21.458
Thank you.

49:27.764 --> 49:28.799
[sighs]

49:40.610 --> 49:41.645
[gasps]

50:27.991 --> 50:30.327
[zombie] Brains!
