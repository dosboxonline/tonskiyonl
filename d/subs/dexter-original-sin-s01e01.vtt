Doris would be so proud.

47:37.187 --> 47:39.522
Hey, the place
felt empty without you.

47:39.523 --> 47:40.565
- Hey.
- Welcome back.

47:40.566 --> 47:42.860
- Missed you, too.
- Ah...

47:43.652 --> 47:46.279
Another Morgan in the building.

47:46.280 --> 47:48.155
Hopefully, you're not
a chip off the old block.
