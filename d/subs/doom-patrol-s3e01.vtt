I lost track of time.

I could help her, but...

way worse.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.969

to hide away in here.

17:52.204 --> 17:53.739
And I'm not just saying that

17:53.806 --> 17:55.407

there's a decomposing body
down the hall.

You're in danger.

19:17.322 --> 19:19.725

19:19.825 --> 19:22.227

the bottom of the well.

19:22.327 --> 19:24.363

you murdered.

19:26.398 --> 19:32.371

down there was you... Daddy.

19:33.672 --> 19:37.042

19:38.343 --> 19:40.712
I'm not Daddy or Miranda.

19:41.847 --> 19:44.383
I'm not even a persona at all.

19:47.219 --> 19:50.389
[distorted] I'm the infection
that's been festering
inside Kay

19:50.489 --> 19:52.925
since personas even existed.

19:53.025 --> 19:56.528
Every doubt,
every fear, every hurt.

19:56.595 --> 19:59.064
I'm the wound
you can't help but scratch.

19:59.164 --> 20:04.770
Your scratching gave me life.
Day after day,
Kay's pain made me stronger.

20:07.339 --> 20:08.740
Now I've taken control.

I swear to God--

21:01.159 --> 21:05.731
Yes. Yes, I am sure you find
my current state very amusing,

21:07.065 --> 21:08.967
but the truth
of the matter is this.

21:11.069 --> 21:13.472
I think my spirit
is trapped here

21:13.572 --> 21:18.410
because my body has not been
put to rest in the proper way.

21:18.477 --> 21:20.746
My remains
have to be incinerated

21:20.812 --> 21:22.981
in order for my spirit
to move on.

21:25.417 --> 21:28.453
[sighs]
And it dawned on me

21:28.520 --> 21:33.325
that if anyone might enjoy
the task of burning me to ash,

21:34.826 --> 21:36.028
it would be you.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.532

You think I'm going to help you
get out of this house

21:51.777 --> 21:53.779
and live happily ever after?

21:53.845 --> 21:55.280
Why are you even talking to me?

21:55.347 --> 21:57.115
Shouldn't you be talking
to your daughter?

21:57.182 --> 21:59.685

can she say goodbye?
-Ah!

21:59.785 --> 22:01.386

22:01.486 --> 22:03.355
Nope. Calling bullshit.

22:03.455 --> 22:07.059
You manipulated and destroyed
the lives of total strangers

22:07.159 --> 22:09.027

fucking benefit,

22:09.127 --> 22:12.397
but now you've got the chance
to say a real goodbye
to your daughter,

22:12.497 --> 22:15.734

Bullshit.

22:15.834 --> 22:19.071
My goodness. I'd forgotten
who I was speaking to.

22:19.171 --> 22:20.405

Hey, asshole,
at least I own my mistakes.

22:23.141 --> 22:25.977
You are so full of shit, Cliff.

22:26.845 --> 22:27.879
You know that?

22:29.815 --> 22:33.885
How do you want
to be remembered
at the end of it all?

22:33.985 --> 22:39.925
When the last of you
has oxidized
into something unidentifiable?

22:40.025 --> 22:42.728
How do you want your child
to remember you?

22:43.695 --> 22:46.064
[Cliff] Warts and all.

22:48.533 --> 22:51.536
Well, I guess that makes you
a better man than I.

22:51.603 --> 22:54.940
[Cliff] You took everything
from me, Chief. Everything.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.376
And after it was all gone,

22:57.442 --> 23:01.380
the last thing I had
was hating you.

23:01.446 --> 23:05.350
Now you're gone, too.
So what the fuck now?

23:07.219 --> 23:08.453
What about Clara?

23:11.123 --> 23:13.425
[Cliff] I don't deserve to be
a part of Clara's life.

23:14.893 --> 23:16.595
You shouldn't give up, Cliff.

23:18.797 --> 23:22.768
I've walked
this godforsaken rock
for more than 100 years,

23:22.868 --> 23:27.305
and one thing I've learned
is there's very little
you can't recover from.

23:29.074 --> 23:32.043
Sometimes we need
a little help,

23:32.110 --> 23:34.813

I sent the tape to Clara.

23:36.648 --> 23:38.150
[Cliff] You what?

23:38.250 --> 23:41.787
I hoped it would help you
and Clara to mend things,

of unanswered questions.

23:48.293 --> 23:49.928
And to be completely honest...

23:52.130 --> 23:55.634
I hoped it would help
mend things between us.

between us.

52:11.628 --> 52:12.996
where am I?

52:13.096 --> 52:14.798
-Cloverton.
-Cloverton.

52:14.865 --> 52:17.767
-And the year?
-2021.

52:17.834 --> 52:19.136
Oh.

52:19.202 --> 52:21.671
Okay, that should work.
I think.

52:22.939 --> 52:24.341
Say, you wouldn't
happen to know

52:24.441 --> 52:29.813
where I could find
a Niles Caulder, would you?

52:29.880 --> 52:31.214
[squelching]

52:31.314 --> 52:32.182
What?

52:43.660 --> 52:45.729
[screaming]

52:48.498 --> 52:49.399
Oh.

52:56.339 --> 52:57.541
[sighs]

53:00.076 --> 53:02.012
Oh, well.

53:02.078 --> 53:05.649
Guess I'll just have to
find him myself, then.

53:05.715 --> 53:07.184
[mutters] Thanks for nothing.

53:08.518 --> 53:10.520
[rumbling]

53:23.333 --> 53:27.571
Niles Caulder... I'm coming.

53:29.706 --> 53:30.574
Uh...

53:32.075 --> 53:32.909
Huh.

54:01.571 --> 54:03.440
[fire crackling]

54:14.918 --> 54:16.820
[woman moaning in pleasure]

54:24.261 --> 54:25.228
[Niles] Oh.

54:26.263 --> 54:27.264
Well, hello.

54:28.431 --> 54:29.399
[continues moaning]

54:29.466 --> 54:30.400
No.

54:33.003 --> 54:34.938
Oh, what the hell.

54:42.812 --> 54:44.981
What the fu...

54:45.081 --> 54:46.683
[flesh tearing]

54:49.319 --> 54:50.453
[man grunts]

55:01.865 --> 55:06.036
Smile, Caulder.
The world ain't done
with you yet, old man.

55:06.636 --> 55:07.871
[chuckles]

56:05.228 --> 56:06.730
[man] Greg, move your head!
