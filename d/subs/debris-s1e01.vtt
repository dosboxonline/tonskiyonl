billions of planets.

11:16.129 --> 11:21.169

11:21.169 --> 11:23.000
That's the job.

11:24.149 --> 11:26.210
Impossible.

11:26.210 --> 11:28.080
I don't know

11:26.210 --> 11:28.080
if you know this,

11:28.080 --> 11:31.200
but my dad was

11:28.080 --> 11:31.200

11:31.200 --> 11:34.080
to be told the truth

11:31.200 --> 11:34.080
about what they found.

11:34.080 --> 11:38.080
And when he saw all

11:34.080 --> 11:38.080
the Hubble Telescope shots

11:34.080 --> 11:38.080
of the wrecked spacecraft,

11:38.080 --> 11:40.210
which was spectacular,

11:40.210 --> 11:42.230
the Debris cloud was huge.

26:14.220 --> 26:17.210
We fought, like, a lot.

26:17.210 --> 26:19.089
Like, all the time.

26:20.210 --> 26:23.089
We went to therapy,

26:20.210 --> 26:23.089
all of us.

26:24.109 --> 26:27.140
So I decided

26:24.109 --> 26:27.140
it would be best

26:27.140 --> 26:30.019
if I left the house

26:27.140 --> 26:30.019
for a little while.

26:31.220 --> 26:34.069
I told my mom...

26:34.069 --> 26:36.230
that if she hadn't taken

26:34.069 --> 26:36.230
my brother to the gas station

26:36.230 --> 26:38.220
to get candy that day,

26:38.220 --> 26:40.190
they wouldn't have been

26:38.220 --> 26:40.190
driving down that road

26:40.190 --> 26:42.180
when the drunk driver

26:40.190 --> 26:42.180
hit them.

26:44.029 --> 26:46.019
My brother

26:44.029 --> 26:46.019
wouldn't have died.

26:48.230 --> 26:50.059
Excuse me.

26:58.029 --> 27:01.029
FINOLA: I know what grief

26:58.029 --> 27:01.029
can do to a person.

27:01.029 --> 27:03.220
How it makes you

27:01.029 --> 27:03.220
feel really...

27:03.220 --> 27:08.049
alone, right?

27:03.220 --> 27:08.049
Yeah.

27:11.079 --> 27:15.109
My mum died of cancer

27:11.079 --> 27:15.109
two years ago.

27:15.109 --> 27:18.230
And my dad, well...

27:18.230 --> 27:22.069
he couldn't

27:18.230 --> 27:22.069
get over her death

27:22.069 --> 27:26.000
no matter how hard

27:22.069 --> 27:26.000
he tried, and...

27:26.000 --> 27:29.069
Yeah, I lost him too

27:26.000 --> 27:29.069
a short time later.

27:30.190 --> 27:34.109
I was completely lost,

27:34.109 --> 27:38.079
just closed off

27:34.109 --> 27:38.079
from everyone.

27:38.079 --> 27:40.160
I know that

27:38.079 --> 27:40.160
you're strong.

27:40.160 --> 27:44.160
And I know that whatever you

27:40.160 --> 27:44.160
might have said to your mum,

27:44.160 --> 27:48.160
she still loves you.

27:44.160 --> 27:48.160
You're okay.

27:53.089 --> 27:54.210
They're bringing her

27:53.089 --> 27:54.210
to a friend's house

27:54.210 --> 27:57.089
until her aunt can

27:54.210 --> 27:57.089
get here from Wyoming.

27:57.089 --> 27:59.089
That was bad

27:57.089 --> 27:59.089
back there.

27:59.089 --> 28:01.039
Sorry.

28:02.170 --> 28:06.089
I...

28:02.170 --> 28:06.089
I didn't know what to say.

28:07.039 --> 28:08.140
That's okay.

28:10.089 --> 28:13.009
I'm sure there are things

28:10.089 --> 28:13.009
you're worse at.

28:15.160 --> 28:17.200
I knew someone

28:15.160 --> 28:17.200
like her once.

28:18.170 --> 28:20.019
Ah.

28:22.089 --> 28:24.079
Well, everyone's

28:22.089 --> 28:24.079
got a past, Bryan.

28:26.039 --> 28:29.180
I always find when I give

28:26.039 --> 28:29.180
a part of myself,

28:29.180 --> 28:33.049
I don't know, I always get

28:29.180 --> 28:33.049
so much more back.

28:34.140 --> 28:37.140
Connection.

28:34.140 --> 28:37.140
It's all we really have

28:37.140 --> 28:40.099
to keep us on the ground here.

28:43.130 --> 28:46.009
You know, when you were

28:43.130 --> 28:46.009
outside greeting the team,

28:46.009 --> 28:47.140
I went out to the Debris,

28:46.009 --> 28:47.140
because I wanted to

28:47.140 --> 28:49.170
run some DF tests.

28:51.049 --> 28:55.170
It manifested

28:51.049 --> 28:55.170
a vision of my mother

28:56.180 --> 28:58.220
In my mind.

28:56.180 --> 28:58.220
From my memory.

28:58.220 --> 29:01.099
It only clocked in at an 85.

29:01.099 --> 29:05.059
It's as if the Debris pulled

29:01.099 --> 29:05.059
that memory from me

29:05.059 --> 29:10.220
because it felt my

29:05.059 --> 29:10.220
longing for her.

29:10.220 --> 29:13.150
I think this is all about

29:10.220 --> 29:13.150
Mary Vandeberg.

29:13.150 --> 29:17.150
I think it's her grief that

29:13.150 --> 29:17.150
caused her dead son to manifest.

29:17.150 --> 29:19.109
FINOLA: She probably thought

29:17.150 --> 29:19.109
it was a miracle

29:19.109 --> 29:21.230
when she saw her son alive.

29:21.230 --> 29:23.109
So she calls her daughter

29:21.230 --> 29:23.109
to come--

29:23.109 --> 29:25.069
BRYAN: Right.

29:23.109 --> 29:25.069
And then 24 hours later,

29:25.069 --> 29:26.230
she says don't come.

29:26.230 --> 29:28.109
-Something happened.

29:26.230 --> 29:28.109
-Yeah.

29:28.109 --> 29:29.190
We heard what Sharon said.

29:29.190 --> 29:31.109
They were all being

29:29.190 --> 29:31.109
drained of energy.

29:31.109 --> 29:34.150
Maybe he had to drain the dad

29:31.109 --> 29:34.150
to continue to exist.

29:34.150 --> 29:37.150
Yeah. Like it's using people

29:34.150 --> 29:37.150
as batteries.

29:37.150 --> 29:39.109
Right, and then the dad's

29:37.150 --> 29:39.109
been out there in the field--

29:39.109 --> 29:41.220
The kid needs another battery,

29:39.109 --> 29:41.220
someone else.

29:41.220 --> 29:44.019
The closest person he had

29:41.220 --> 29:44.019
to him was his mom,

29:44.019 --> 29:46.140
so he drains her, and now

29:44.019 --> 29:46.140
it's just running on autopilot,

29:46.140 --> 29:48.019
finding other people to drain.

29:48.019 --> 29:49.230
WOMAN (whispering):

29:48.019 --> 29:49.230
Jenna Goldland...

29:51.029 --> 29:53.089
Jenna Goldland...

29:54.200 --> 29:57.119
-WOMAN: Jenna Goldland...

29:54.200 --> 29:57.119
-MAN: Jenna Goldland...

29:57.119 --> 30:01.039
(whispering continues,

29:57.119 --> 30:01.039
multiple voices overlapping)

30:01.039 --> 30:03.109
Jenna Goldland.

30:04.150 --> 30:07.049
FINOLA:

30:04.150 --> 30:07.049
It's a theory. Anyway...

30:08.200 --> 30:10.230
(phone ringing)

30:13.200 --> 30:15.069
Hi, Sharon.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.150
Who's Jenna Goldland?

30:23.119 --> 30:25.119
That's my mother's name.

30:33.009 --> 30:33.019
.

30:35.099 --> 30:36.099
They're obviously somehow

30:35.220 --> 30:36.099
still connected to the Debris.

30:37.210 --> 30:39.119
They must still be aware.

30:39.119 --> 30:42.089
Maybe there's a way

30:39.119 --> 30:42.089
to still reach them.

30:42.089 --> 30:44.109
Another woman was

30:42.089 --> 30:44.109
reported missing

30:44.109 --> 30:46.029
from outside a restaurant.

30:46.029 --> 30:48.019
She left with a child that

30:46.029 --> 30:48.019
matches the boy's description.

30:51.150 --> 30:53.160
(indistinct chatter on radio)

31:01.049 --> 31:02.190
♪♪♪

31:04.210 --> 31:06.039
Freeze!

31:17.079 --> 31:19.000
Holloway?

31:20.059 --> 31:24.119
(gasping)

31:20.059 --> 31:24.119
Help me.

31:24.119 --> 31:29.059
(wheezes)

31:24.119 --> 31:29.059
Help me.

31:29.059 --> 31:32.089
Help me.

31:38.039 --> 31:40.140
MAN (on radio): We picked up

31:38.039 --> 31:40.140
an atmospheric disruption

31:40.140 --> 31:43.019
under the bridge.

31:40.140 --> 31:43.019
Route 4.

31:43.019 --> 31:46.049
MAN 2: Pulling in now.

31:43.019 --> 31:46.049
Keep your bird in the air.

31:48.170 --> 31:50.170
We got tire tracks.

32:01.009 --> 32:04.009
BRYAN: We got one of them.

32:01.009 --> 32:04.009
He teleported into

32:01.009 --> 32:04.009
the bridge support.

32:04.009 --> 32:06.019
He's one of the same guys

32:04.009 --> 32:06.019
from the hotel yesterday

32:06.019 --> 32:09.150
who bought the nacho.

32:06.019 --> 32:09.150
Who are they?

32:09.150 --> 32:11.210
Whoever they are,

32:09.150 --> 32:11.210
they have something we don't.

32:11.210 --> 32:13.190
This is an organized group.

32:13.190 --> 32:15.180
There's no way two

32:13.190 --> 32:15.180
individuals would be funded

32:15.180 --> 32:18.069
the way they need to be

32:15.180 --> 32:18.069
in order to find this.

32:18.069 --> 32:19.180
All right.

32:19.180 --> 32:21.059
I'm having the body

32:19.180 --> 32:21.059
transported here.

32:21.059 --> 32:22.220
I'll be in touch.

32:24.059 --> 32:26.220
Bryan?

32:26.220 --> 32:28.140
I was thinking about

32:26.220 --> 32:28.140
the different connections

32:28.140 --> 32:30.130
between the victims.

32:30.130 --> 32:32.190
They were all found

32:30.130 --> 32:32.190
in the same field

32:32.190 --> 32:34.130
near that canal.

32:34.130 --> 32:38.029
So I pulled the actual

32:34.130 --> 32:38.029
accident report.

32:38.029 --> 32:40.079
That's where

32:38.029 --> 32:40.079
the crash took place.

32:40.079 --> 32:42.029
That's where he died.

32:42.029 --> 32:43.069
When the car

32:42.029 --> 32:43.069
was hit head-on,

32:43.069 --> 32:45.079
it came to a stop

32:43.069 --> 32:45.079
in that water.

32:45.079 --> 32:46.230
I mean,

32:45.079 --> 32:46.230
is he taking them there?

32:46.230 --> 32:49.140
His sister said they stopped

32:46.230 --> 32:49.140
at a gas station

32:49.140 --> 32:51.029
before they crashed.

32:51.029 --> 32:53.059
The woman we found in

32:51.029 --> 32:53.059
the field, Amy Morrison,

32:53.059 --> 32:54.220
Tom showed us footage of her

32:54.220 --> 32:56.190
-with the boy, remember?

32:54.220 --> 32:56.190
-Mm-hmm.

32:56.190 --> 32:58.200
We passed that gas station

32:56.190 --> 32:58.200
when we drove in.

32:58.200 --> 33:00.160
It's on the same road.

32:58.200 --> 33:00.160
I think you're right.

33:00.160 --> 33:03.230
I think he's taking her on the

33:00.160 --> 33:03.230
same route the night he died.

33:08.000 --> 33:09.029
(bell jingles)

33:10.140 --> 33:12.109
My son loves these candies.

33:12.109 --> 33:14.160
They're like sour but sweet

33:12.109 --> 33:14.160
at the same time.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.150
Yeah, right there.

33:16.150 --> 33:18.230
Oh, thanks so much.

33:20.099 --> 33:22.039
(bell jingles)

33:23.130 --> 33:25.119
Good evening, ma'am.

33:25.119 --> 33:29.019
Agent Beneventi. Can I talk

33:25.119 --> 33:29.019
to you just for a few seconds?

33:32.049 --> 33:35.049
The boy in the car,

33:32.049 --> 33:35.049
do you know who that is?

33:35.049 --> 33:37.099
That's my son.

33:50.109 --> 33:53.000
He's, uh,

33:50.109 --> 33:53.000
he's not your son.

33:53.000 --> 33:54.210
What are you talking about?

33:54.210 --> 33:57.029
What's your name?

33:57.029 --> 33:58.190
Kieran.

33:58.190 --> 34:01.069
(cymbals jingling)

34:01.069 --> 34:05.230
You're not Kieran.

34:01.069 --> 34:05.230
You don't belong here.

34:08.139 --> 34:10.130
I'm wanted here.

34:14.170 --> 34:18.219
(panting)

34:18.219 --> 34:21.000
-Ma'am. Ma'am.

34:18.219 --> 34:21.000
-Let go of me.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.199
-I'm not going to hurt you.

34:21.000 --> 34:22.199
-Let me go!

34:22.199 --> 34:25.050
-You have to understand--

34:22.199 --> 34:25.050
-Why are you doing this?

34:25.050 --> 34:26.150
Nobody's going to

34:25.050 --> 34:26.150
hurt him.

34:33.130 --> 34:34.230
(cymbals jingling)

34:36.039 --> 34:40.039
(panting)

34:47.150 --> 34:50.039
CASHIER: What the--

34:47.150 --> 34:50.039
Oh, my--

34:54.110 --> 34:57.099
(sirens in distance)

34:57.099 --> 34:59.070
-(engine revs)

34:57.099 --> 34:59.070
-(phone ringing)

34:59.070 --> 35:01.070
-Tom.

34:59.070 --> 35:01.070
-The unit should be

34:59.070 --> 35:01.070
with you already.

35:01.070 --> 35:02.219
-I'm on you way to your 20.

35:01.070 --> 35:02.219
-Negative. No.

35:02.219 --> 35:04.130
You said you know

35:02.219 --> 35:04.130
where they're going.

35:04.130 --> 35:06.099
After what I just saw,

35:04.130 --> 35:06.099
even if we get to her,

35:06.099 --> 35:08.110
there isn't anything we can do.

35:06.099 --> 35:08.110
I can't help her there.

35:08.110 --> 35:09.190
What do you want me to do?

35:09.190 --> 35:11.219
I need you to get Isla.

35:20.130 --> 35:22.179
They're not in any pain.

35:24.050 --> 35:28.000
My partner thinks that

35:24.050 --> 35:28.000
your mother's grief is

35:24.050 --> 35:28.000
what's causing this.

35:28.000 --> 35:31.190
This isn't her fault,

35:28.000 --> 35:31.190
but I need you to reach her

35:28.000 --> 35:31.190
so we can stop it.

35:35.039 --> 35:36.150
Can she hear me?

35:38.000 --> 35:40.139
She has to.

35:40.139 --> 35:42.190
My partner's life

35:40.139 --> 35:42.190
depends on it.

35:53.199 --> 35:55.190
Mom?

35:55.190 --> 35:59.099
Mom, I need you to wake up.

35:59.099 --> 36:01.130
Mom, wake up, please.

35:59.099 --> 36:01.130
Please wake up.

36:05.179 --> 36:08.199

Please wake up.

36:22.130 --> 36:25.159

36:22.130 --> 36:25.159
I can't do this.

36:32.130 --> 36:34.230
I know you're scared.

36:34.230 --> 36:37.130
I'm scared, too.

36:37.130 --> 36:40.010
But you have to

36:37.130 --> 36:40.010
try to tell her

36:40.010 --> 36:42.039
how much you need her.

36:44.190 --> 36:46.150
I know...

36:49.000 --> 36:50.170
from experience...

36:56.019 --> 36:58.050
you will not be able

36:56.019 --> 36:58.050
to forgive yourself

36:58.050 --> 36:59.210
if you don't.

37:13.170 --> 37:17.170
to hold on to what we have.

37:17.170 --> 37:21.059
I'm so sorry for everything.

37:21.059 --> 37:23.210
And I know--

what her experience was.

39:47.059 --> 39:50.219

39:50.219 --> 39:54.199
and it would make her

39:50.219 --> 39:54.199
dream of him.

39:54.199 --> 39:57.119
And then one morning,

39:54.199 --> 39:57.119
she went to it,

39:57.119 --> 40:00.119
and he was standing there.

You went through a lot.
