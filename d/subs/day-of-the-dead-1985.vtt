01:23.867 --> 01:27.587
- Nothin', nothin' at all.
- Send it again.

01:27.687 --> 01:30.090
I've been sendin' it up and down the
coast from Sarasota to the Everglades.

01:30.190 --> 01:33.176
It's still getting back the same
day it aired. There's nothing.

01:33.711 --> 01:36.531
There's nobody, or at
least nobody with a radio.

01:36.631 --> 01:39.076
All right then. Let's set down.
We'll use the bullhorn.

01:39.176 --> 01:42.051
Set down? Wait a minute.
That's not in our contract.

01:42.151 --> 01:45.690
It's the biggest city within 150 miles.
We're gonna give it every chance.

01:45.790 --> 01:48.359
- Jesus, Mary and Joseph.
- Set down, John.

01:49.259 --> 01:53.863
I'll set us down, but I won't leave my seat,
and I'll keep the engine running.

01:54.563 --> 01:57.467
Now, the first sign of trouble,
I'm going up.

01:57.967 --> 02:02.778
If you ain't on board when that happens,
you're likely to have a lousy afternoon.

03:06.469 --> 03:09.357
Calling anybody on this frequency.

03:09.457 --> 03:12.425
This is helicopter 4-0-alpha.

03:12.825 --> 03:15.587
If you can hear me,
please listen carefully.

03:41.120 --> 03:43.419
Hello?

03:45.024 --> 03:47.630
Hello?

03:47.753 --> 03:50.429
Is anyone there?

03:51.180 --> 03:53.470
Hello?

03:56.085 --> 03:58.122
Hello?

03:59.122 --> 04:01.898
Is anyone there?

04:05.027 --> 04:07.447
Hello?

04:07.977 --> 04:10.256
Is anyone there?

04:14.100 --> 04:16.724
Is anyone there?

04:21.344 --> 04:23.037
Hello?

04:25.948 --> 04:29.036
Is there anyone there?

04:41.080 --> 04:43.383
Hello?

04:52.524 --> 04:54.975
Hello?

04:56.111 --> 04:58.715
Is there anyone there?

04:59.807 --> 05:02.086
Hello?

05:03.345 --> 05:05.611
Hello?

05:07.389 --> 05:09.704
Is anyone there?

05:15.598 --> 05:17.957
Hello?

05:36.875 --> 05:42.342
We can lift you out to safety.
Please answer my call if you can hear me.

05:42.493 --> 05:44.635
Forget it, Billy boy.

05:45.236 --> 05:49.863
It's a dead place.
They got the others, you know.

05:50.801 --> 05:52.594
Listen.

05:55.371 --> 05:58.246
You can hear it over the engine.

05:58.874 --> 06:01.935
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

07:09.575 --> 07:11.413
Hey, you find anything?

07:11.813 --> 07:16.037
Yeah. A bunch of real estate
for sale at closeout prices, man.

07:16.337 --> 07:18.504
Gas up the machine. She's down to fumes.

07:19.004 --> 07:22.525
No. Wait till it's dark.
There are too many of them out there.

07:22.625 --> 07:25.661
Yeah-hey, it's no good to
leave the gas tank empty.

07:25.761 --> 07:27.694
Suppose we need to get
out of here in a hurry.

07:27.795 --> 07:31.397
Then we're shit out of luck.
They're getting too riled up.

07:31.532 --> 07:33.219
Do it tonight when they can't see you.

07:33.319 --> 07:36.093
They know we're in here
even if they can't see us.

07:36.394 --> 07:39.486
- What good is it to leave the gas tank emp...
- The activity excites them.

07:39.586 --> 07:42.462
- There are too many of them.
- And more and more every day.

07:42.562 --> 07:44.529
If we get a lot more,
come out and shoot some of them.

07:44.629 --> 07:47.416
Otherwise, stay inside the building.
Stay out of sight.

07:47.516 --> 07:48.919
Thankful you live in
the suburbs, Johnson.

07:49.019 --> 07:51.942
You oughta see how congested
the city's gettin' to be.

07:58.244 --> 08:00.986
Miguel, come on. Let's get below.

08:01.747 --> 08:05.045
Miguel... what can I do? You... you...

08:05.145 --> 08:06.467
What?

08:07.368 --> 08:10.033
- Let me help.
- No. I don't need help. I don't need help.

08:10.134 --> 08:12.403
- Come on. Give me this.
- I'm all right. I'm just tired.

08:12.504 --> 08:14.143
You're not alright.
You're collapsing from stress.

08:14.243 --> 08:16.562
- Now, let me help...
- Collapsing from stress?

08:16.762 --> 08:21.317
We're all collapsing. This whole fucking
unit is collapsing, everybody except you.

08:21.467 --> 08:25.275
I know you're strong, all right?
So what? Stronger than me.

08:25.375 --> 08:29.032
Stronger than everyone.
So what? So fucking what?

08:48.610 --> 08:52.413
- That's a new grave.
- Major Cooper. He died this morning.

08:54.917 --> 08:57.219
And then there were 12.

08:57.519 --> 09:00.055
A burial this morning.
That's why there are so many of them.

09:00.155 --> 09:01.958
What's gonna bring them tomorrow, Sarah?

09:02.058 --> 09:04.999
And the next day and
the next day after that?

09:05.099 --> 09:09.565
There are hundreds of 'em over there.
Thousands. A million of them!

09:09.665 --> 09:11.035
You stick your head in the sun,

09:11.135 --> 09:13.747
they're gonna come up behind
you and bite off your ass!

09:13.854 --> 09:16.224
This is bullshit,
what we're doing here it's crazy.

09:16.324 --> 09:19.175
If you've got an alternative to what
we're doing, we'd be happy to listen to it.

09:19.275 --> 09:21.977
I got an alternative. Yeah, yeah.
I got an alternative.

09:22.077 --> 09:26.182
Let's get in that whirlybird, find us
an island someplace, get juiced up

09:26.282 --> 09:29.920
and spend what time we got
left soakin' up some sunshine.

09:30.020 --> 09:32.388
- How's that?
- You could do that, couldn't you?

09:32.488 --> 09:35.391
With all that's going on, you could
do that without a second thought?

09:35.491 --> 09:39.698
Shit. I could do that even
if all this wasn't goin' on.

10:11.143 --> 10:14.530
- Another waste of time, right?
- Got that right, man.

10:28.341 --> 10:29.945
- What'd you find?
- Nothin'.

10:30.045 --> 10:31.588
Nothin'?

10:32.138 --> 10:34.869
- How far up the coast did you go?
- A hundred miles each way.

10:36.852 --> 10:39.856
Jump in here, soldier. We gotta bring
in two more dumb fucks. Let's go.

10:39.956 --> 10:42.019
Two more? What's Logan
doing to them in there?

10:42.119 --> 10:43.578
Get in here, soldier.

10:43.678 --> 10:46.462
He's been awake for 24 hours.
Can't you get anyone else?

10:46.562 --> 10:49.765
What "anyone else"?
There isn't anyone else. We're it.

10:50.065 --> 10:52.994
The two of you can't go in
there alone. It's too dangerous.

10:55.170 --> 10:56.789
Christ.

10:57.801 --> 10:58.974
I'll go!

10:59.074 --> 11:02.412
- What's the matter with your friend there?
- There's nothing the matter.

11:03.212 --> 11:05.181
All right. Let's go.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.188
You got it, Steel.

11:41.483 --> 11:43.930
Let's kick it out. Come on.
Step forward.

12:13.800 --> 12:18.614
Christ! This shows the 15th as the last
time you took any out. That can't be right.

12:18.714 --> 12:21.458
Oh, yeah. We forget to write
'em up sometimes, you know?

12:21.558 --> 12:24.028
You've got to write them up.
It's essential.

12:24.128 --> 12:26.929
Can't you get that
through your thick skull?

12:27.029 --> 12:30.038
How the hell are we supposed to
keep track of how many we got left?

12:37.673 --> 12:40.626
Let's go, you dumb fucks! Get over here!

12:41.526 --> 12:44.530
Hey! Here we are!

12:46.341 --> 12:48.007
Come on!

12:50.936 --> 12:53.572
Come on, you dumb fucks.
Come on. Come on.

12:55.789 --> 12:59.178
Come on, you fish brains.
What the hell's the matter with ya?

12:59.478 --> 13:01.500
They're scared.

13:02.431 --> 13:04.795
They know what'll happen
when Frankenstein gets 'em.

13:05.695 --> 13:09.624
If you're right, Rickles,
then they're learning.

13:10.070 --> 13:13.392
- They're actually learning.
- Come on!

13:13.492 --> 13:17.915
Come and see what I got for you!
Come on, you dick faces!

13:18.015 --> 13:20.393
Here's a nice one hangin'.

13:20.493 --> 13:24.363
Come on. Come and get it.
Come and try to bite it off!

13:24.463 --> 13:27.389
That's it, Steel. Whip it out.
That'll bring 'em on.

13:27.489 --> 13:31.493
Fuckin' "A." Biggest piece
of meat in the cave.

13:31.793 --> 13:35.898
I don't wanna excite the lady though.
Not with her boyfriend around.

13:35.998 --> 13:40.553
You're incapable of exciting me, Steel,
except as an anthropological curiosity.

13:40.653 --> 13:44.890
- What the hell's that mean, Rickles?
- It means you're a caveman, asshole.

13:44.990 --> 13:50.431
You're a fuckin' throwback. You've been
spendin' too much time underground, huh?

13:51.225 --> 13:55.536
It's okay, Steel.
Throwbacks all got big dicks.

13:59.405 --> 14:02.943
All right, you dumb fucks!
Get over here, you scumbags!

14:03.043 --> 14:06.480
Your old pal Steel wants
to see ya. Come on!

14:09.531 --> 14:11.233
- Shit.
- I'm coming up.

14:11.333 --> 14:13.454
You're not strong enough for
up here. Send up the pole.

14:13.554 --> 14:15.125
I'll watch out for lover boy.
Don't worry.

14:15.225 --> 14:17.639
What do you mean I'm not strong enough?
I've done it dozens of times.

14:17.739 --> 14:21.378
I don't want you up here, lady.
Send up the pole. They're gettin' closer.

14:21.478 --> 14:24.646
- He's collapsing for chrissakes. Look at 'im.
- Let go of the pole.

14:24.746 --> 14:27.450
- Listen to me...
- Let go of the goddamn pole.

14:27.550 --> 14:29.102
Here they come! Let's go!

14:31.303 --> 14:35.508
Dumb fucks. Pus-breeding bags of shit.

14:35.908 --> 14:40.447
You dumb-fucking bags of shit,
I'll kick your fuckin' asses. Come on!

14:46.201 --> 14:48.003
Come here, scumbag.

15:02.684 --> 15:04.712
Hook her up, will ya?

15:05.052 --> 15:06.681
Hook her.

15:09.891 --> 15:12.405
Hey, nice hat, asshole.

15:16.164 --> 15:17.983
Come on! Get the other one out of there!

15:30.096 --> 15:31.491
Come on. Get in there.

15:46.694 --> 15:49.233
Steel, Steel, Steel, cover! Cover!

15:49.333 --> 15:50.810
- I got it.
- Jesus!

15:53.001 --> 15:55.340
That's it. That's it. That's it.
I got it. I got it. Come on.

15:55.440 --> 15:59.007
Come on. Come on. Come here. Come here.

16:08.950 --> 16:12.221
You almost killed Rickles. Yeah.

16:12.321 --> 16:14.282
You almost fucking killed Rickles.

16:16.459 --> 16:18.900
Let 'im go, Steel. He shouldn't have
been up there in the first place.

16:19.000 --> 16:22.333
- You almost fucking killed Rickles.
- Steel, stop it!

16:23.799 --> 16:26.602
You dirty son of a spic bastard!

16:26.702 --> 16:30.037
Let him go! Let him go, goddamn it,

16:30.137 --> 16:32.206
or I'll cut you in half.

17:00.302 --> 17:03.505
Shut up, you dumb fucks.
I hope they chop you up for dog meat.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.888
- Come on, Rickles.
- Let's get out of here.

17:06.343 --> 17:08.281
I hope you fuckin' rot!

17:09.160 --> 17:10.759
Fuck you!

17:23.208 --> 17:26.426
I am not gonna let you dope me up.

17:29.615 --> 17:33.619
You need a sedative.
You're behaving dangerously.

17:33.719 --> 17:35.568
I'm just trying to help you, Miguel.

17:36.168 --> 17:38.774
Well, I don't need your
help or anyone else's.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.834
You made me look like
an asshole out there.

17:50.334 --> 17:52.741
You made me feel like a piece of shit.

17:56.141 --> 17:58.144
You stay away from me with that, Sarah.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.757
You stay away from me.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.377
You bitch.

18:56.302 --> 18:58.405
We've got to have sterile conditions.

18:58.505 --> 19:01.907
Half the work we do goes down
the toilet due to contaminations.

19:02.007 --> 19:04.124
You'll work with what you got, Fisher.

19:04.324 --> 19:06.190
But it's madness!

19:06.811 --> 19:09.705
- Can't you understand...
- I understand this:

19:10.005 --> 19:15.115
You and your playmates, you're running
out of friends fast around here.

19:21.790 --> 19:23.266
Look...

19:24.090 --> 19:27.749
- Major Cooper promised that we...
- Major Cooper is dead.

19:29.568 --> 19:32.906
I'm in command now,
and I'm telling you...

19:33.006 --> 19:35.774
that you work with what you got.

19:35.874 --> 19:38.677
And you'd better start
showing me some results...

19:38.777 --> 19:40.679
or you won't have that very much longer.

19:40.779 --> 19:44.183
How can we show you results when we
don't have the proper working conditions?

19:44.483 --> 19:47.986
We're in a desperate situation here.
We need each other.

19:48.086 --> 19:51.024
- Can't we just get along?
- You need us, the way I see it, lady.

19:51.624 --> 19:55.561
- I'm not sure we need you at all.
- Fuckin' "A."

19:55.761 --> 20:00.000
I'm not even sure just what
the hell it is you're doin' in there.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.869
Just what the hell it is my men
are riskin' their asses for.

20:03.969 --> 20:06.362
Maybe if there was more
cooperation around here,

20:06.462 --> 20:09.349
your men wouldn't have to
risk their asses quite as often.

20:13.745 --> 20:17.032
- Miguel Salazar's in bad shape.
- No shit.

20:18.932 --> 20:22.739
I want him pulled off active duty for a
while until we can evaluate his condition.

20:22.839 --> 20:24.400
Can't spare 'im.

20:24.500 --> 20:27.188
He's over the edge.
He's turning into jell-o.

20:27.288 --> 20:30.937
Jell-o? That's the way the
spics say "yellow": Jell-o!

20:32.798 --> 20:34.705
Miguel is seriously disturbed.

20:35.205 --> 20:38.504
He's close to the breaking point,
and that's dangerous for all of us.

20:39.104 --> 20:41.771
He can't handle any
more stress right now.

20:43.308 --> 20:47.470
Well, maybe I should cut off
his extracurricular activities.

20:49.414 --> 20:52.317
Maybe you're keepin'
him too busy at night.

20:53.217 --> 20:56.857
We're talking about a man's
life here, you son of a bitch.

20:57.157 --> 21:00.075
And the lives of others
he might put in jeopardy.

21:00.775 --> 21:04.914
Maybe I should put him in quarantine.
How 'bout it, Steel?

21:05.014 --> 21:08.110
You call it, Captain.
I'll build him a cage.

21:09.310 --> 21:12.137
Yeah. Might not be a bad idea...

21:12.337 --> 21:14.975
give some of the rest of
us a shot at some lovin'.

21:15.075 --> 21:17.847
Hey, it's gonna be a long winter.

21:22.647 --> 21:24.567
Come on, Ted. Let's get out of here.

21:25.567 --> 21:28.770
I'm callin' a meeting
for 7 o'clock tonight.

21:28.870 --> 21:32.674
I want everybody present.
Everybody, lady.

21:32.774 --> 21:35.977
Including Dr. Frankenstein
and including your boyfriend.

21:36.077 --> 21:38.237
I gave him a sedative.
He won't be awake.

21:38.337 --> 21:41.456
Look here, woman.
I'm short on man power.

21:41.556 --> 21:44.905
I won't have you goin' around dopin' up
any of my men without orders from me.

21:45.005 --> 21:49.141
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir! Fuck you, sir!

21:53.928 --> 21:56.331
Out of the frying pan, into the fire.

21:56.531 --> 22:00.335
I thought Cooper was an asshole,
but he was a sweetheart next to Rhodes.

22:00.435 --> 22:03.244
We could be in real trouble.
You'd better watch yourself...

22:03.344 --> 22:06.511
- I mean, physically watch yourself.
- I can handle it.

22:06.611 --> 22:08.844
Don't worry.
It's not going to come to that.

22:08.944 --> 22:11.047
We've just gotta pound
some logic into their heads.

22:11.147 --> 22:12.750
Impossible.

22:13.425 --> 22:14.750
Where's Dr. Logan?

22:14.850 --> 22:17.468
Frankenstein? He's in
his laboratory. Where else?

22:20.288 --> 22:24.861
There's a loss of initiative, caution,
many of the human cognitive functions.

22:24.961 --> 22:28.865
Apparently the result of
decay in the frontal, parietal,

22:29.065 --> 22:31.283
temporal and occipital lobes.

22:32.083 --> 22:36.073
On revival, the rate of
decomposition slows substantially.

22:37.885 --> 22:41.910
Indications are that these beings could
function over a period of years...

22:42.310 --> 22:47.101
in cases of early revival, 10 to 12 years
before decay would threaten mobility.

22:57.574 --> 23:00.429
The brain is the engine, Sarah,
the motor that drives them.

23:00.529 --> 23:03.365
They don't need any blood flow,
don't need any of their internal organs.

23:04.465 --> 23:07.369
Now, I've severed all the
vital organs in this one.

23:07.469 --> 23:11.173
There's nothing left of the corpse but
brain and limbs, and still it functions.

23:11.273 --> 23:13.312
Oh, look, Sarah. Look.

23:15.977 --> 23:20.283
See, it wants me. It wants food,
but it has no stomach.

23:20.383 --> 23:22.751
It can take no nourishment
from what it ingests.

23:22.951 --> 23:27.232
It's working on instinct,
a deep, dark, primordial instinct.

23:27.432 --> 23:31.878
Decomposition occurs first in
the frontal lobes, the neocortex,

23:31.978 --> 23:34.847
and next in the limbic system,
the middle brain.

23:35.147 --> 23:40.202
But the core... the core is the last
thing to be attacked by the decay.

23:40.402 --> 23:42.591
It's the "R" complex, Sarah, that...

23:42.706 --> 23:47.309
central bit of prehistoric jelly that
we inherited from the reptiles.

23:47.409 --> 23:51.765
Here. I've gone into the center here
and attacked the "R" complex discretely.

23:51.865 --> 23:53.966
I've removed it from the equation...
this corpse.

23:54.866 --> 23:57.354
I believe this creature would be
benign even if it had its eyesight

23:57.454 --> 24:01.822
and its other senses. Its primitive
instincts have been erased.

24:12.383 --> 24:16.990
It still has motor function,
probably still has powers of deliberation.

24:18.590 --> 24:21.193
It can be domesticated,
Sarah, don't you see?

24:21.393 --> 24:25.432
It can be conditioned to behave
the way we want it to behave.

24:25.932 --> 24:29.668
And all that's required is
15 hours of fancy surgery

24:29.768 --> 24:32.070
that only a handful of
people are trained to do.

24:32.370 --> 24:34.695
I thought we were going to
stop work on the neurophysical

24:34.795 --> 24:36.575
and concentrate on
something more practical.

24:36.675 --> 24:39.015
These finds are central
to the condition.

24:39.115 --> 24:42.069
I will not stop any work that
might lead to an answer,

24:42.169 --> 24:45.159
let alone in an area that
is central to the condition.

24:45.859 --> 24:49.137
But you're just proving theories
that were advanced months ago.

24:49.237 --> 24:52.876
And you're not even proving them correctly.
You're making a lot of assumptions here.

24:53.576 --> 24:57.380
You're wasting time trying
to define what's happening

24:57.480 --> 25:00.348
instead of looking for
what's making it happen.

25:00.548 --> 25:02.594
And just slicing up too many specimens.

25:02.694 --> 25:06.054
It's extremely dangerous to go up on
top and round them up in the wild,

25:06.154 --> 25:09.858
where we can't control them.
What happened to this one?

25:10.258 --> 25:12.562
It was too unruly. I couldn't
handle it. I had to destroy it.

25:13.762 --> 25:15.771
We can still get information from it.

25:16.501 --> 25:20.769
Dr. Logan, we are losing
the cooperation of the men.

25:20.869 --> 25:24.407
I'm not even sure they'll go up top when we
run out of the specimens we already have.

25:24.807 --> 25:28.161
I'm not sure they won't just
try to shut us down completely.

25:28.261 --> 25:32.331
Well, I'll show them results.
I'll show them results.

25:33.031 --> 25:37.471
I'll show them that these creatures can be
domesticated even without the surgery.

25:37.971 --> 25:39.969
Knowing what they are,

25:40.269 --> 25:44.543
we can begin to approach them properly,
condition them, control them.

25:44.943 --> 25:47.379
We've got to do this, Sarah.
It's our only hope.

25:59.791 --> 26:02.529
Yes, this is Major Cooper.

26:04.345 --> 26:05.628
I needed him, Sarah.

26:06.828 --> 26:09.617
He's helping us more now than
he ever did when he was alive.

26:10.768 --> 26:15.091
- But I saw the grave.
- They buried one of the specimens.

26:15.791 --> 26:18.510
Jesus. God, Logan.

26:18.710 --> 26:21.813
Do you know what they'll do to
you if they find out about this?

26:21.913 --> 26:23.602
Do you know what
they'll do to all of us?

26:23.702 --> 26:27.863
They'll never find out.
He can't be recognized.

26:55.096 --> 26:59.568
Not a peep. Long-range or short,
high-band or low, I can't raise anybody.

26:59.668 --> 27:02.556
How can that be, McDermott?
There must be other groups like us.

27:02.656 --> 27:06.509
- Somebody else must be tryin' to radio.
- Yeah. What the hell is this, man?

27:06.609 --> 27:09.877
- Maybe we are the only ones left.
- I'm sure there's others.

27:09.977 --> 27:13.581
This is not the best place to be sending from,
and a lot of the equipment I'm using

27:13.681 --> 27:16.019
has been rotting down here
since the second world war.

27:16.119 --> 27:19.037
Well, it's up to you
to get it workin' right.

27:19.637 --> 27:22.976
Lay off the fuckin' booze
for a while, why don't ya?

27:23.076 --> 27:26.044
And get somebody on
that fuckin' horn, pronto.

27:26.344 --> 27:28.500
Well, if we stay down here long enough,

27:28.600 --> 27:30.731
I'll have to lay off the
fuckin' booze, Steel,

27:30.831 --> 27:34.153
'cause there won't fuckin'
be any of it fuckin' left.

27:35.053 --> 27:38.409
In the meanwhile,
I will continue to indulge myself,

27:38.509 --> 27:43.261
and I will continue doing my best in the
good fight against dry rot and rust.

27:43.361 --> 27:47.666
Yeah? Well, your best ain't
good enough, asshole.

27:47.766 --> 27:50.034
You think I'm not
aware of our situation?

27:50.134 --> 27:52.305
You think I want to stay
isolated down here?

27:52.405 --> 27:54.425
You know, I'd make a desperate
effort to raise somebody

27:54.525 --> 27:58.965
just in the hope of gettin' away from
your nasty mouth, Steel. The fact is...

28:02.480 --> 28:04.381
The fact is...

28:05.867 --> 28:08.636
either we are the only ones left...

28:10.371 --> 28:13.910
or there's nobody within range of my
puny little second world war signals.

28:14.010 --> 28:16.778
We used to talk to Washington all
the time. They could hear us then.

28:16.878 --> 28:19.480
We were on relays then.
We weren't over the air.

28:19.580 --> 28:22.418
You know, the power's off on the
mainland now, in case you haven't heard.

28:22.518 --> 28:25.043
And all the shopping malls are closed.

28:25.143 --> 28:28.189
We don't appreciate your
fucking jokes, old man.

28:28.289 --> 28:32.677
Keep it up, and I'll shove that bottle
of yours right up your wise ass.

28:32.877 --> 28:36.516
I've got better things to do than listen to
this kindergarten. Are we finished here?

28:37.116 --> 28:39.884
No, we ain't finished here,
lady. Sit down.

28:39.984 --> 28:43.488
What else do you want? We've given
you the reports for this week.

28:43.588 --> 28:47.192
- We've given you everything you've asked.
- You've given us a mouthful of Greek salad.

28:47.292 --> 28:52.676
Formulas, equations, a lot of fancy
terms that don't mean a thing.

28:53.497 --> 28:55.042
I wanna know if you're doin' something

28:55.142 --> 28:58.288
that's gonna help us out
of this deep shit we're in,

28:58.771 --> 29:02.841
or if you're all in there
just jerkin' each other off.

29:02.941 --> 29:05.047
She doesn't have to jerk off
like the rest of us, Captain.

29:05.147 --> 29:09.387
She got an honest-to-God
dick to get off on, huh?

29:10.417 --> 29:13.853
It may be yellow, but it's still a dick!

29:17.137 --> 29:21.371
I said we ain't finished here,
lady. Sit down.

29:23.394 --> 29:26.700
Sit down, or so help me God,
I'll have you shot.

29:28.800 --> 29:29.994
You'll what?

29:30.738 --> 29:32.631
I said...

29:32.931 --> 29:34.772
"I'll have you shot."

29:34.972 --> 29:38.488
- Have you lost your mind?
- No, ma'am.

29:40.912 --> 29:42.249
Have you?

29:42.549 --> 29:46.677
I just told you I was willing to kill you
if you didn't get back in your chair.

29:47.577 --> 29:49.390
You didn't get back in your chair.

29:49.504 --> 29:52.643
Goddamn it! You can't
shove us around like this.

29:53.425 --> 29:56.112
Since when did this become
a military operation?

29:56.212 --> 29:59.902
Since I took over. Steel...

30:00.302 --> 30:01.702
shoot that woman.

30:02.517 --> 30:05.164
Bang! You're dead.

30:12.927 --> 30:15.530
Shoot that woman or you're dead.

30:16.530 --> 30:18.918
You think I'm fuckin' around, Steel?

30:19.918 --> 30:21.016
You're wrong.

30:22.286 --> 30:26.359
Now, you got till a count of five,
and that's two you wasted.

30:28.016 --> 30:29.710
That's three.

30:31.291 --> 30:32.347
- Four.
- Sit down, Sarah.

30:32.447 --> 30:35.350
- What is this?
- Shut up and sit down.

30:36.050 --> 30:38.186
That's five, Steel.

30:38.719 --> 30:40.817
All right. All right.

30:51.460 --> 30:52.973
No!

31:08.566 --> 31:10.703
Anybody else have any questions

31:10.803 --> 31:14.221
about the way things are gonna
run around here from now on?

31:27.235 --> 31:30.927
This ain't a goddamn field trip, people.

31:32.275 --> 31:35.052
This is a fuckin' war!

31:35.793 --> 31:39.282
I'm not down in this cave for my health.
I'm down here on orders.

31:39.382 --> 31:44.302
Your orders are to facilitate
the job of this scientific team.

31:44.402 --> 31:46.691
This is a civilian team, Captain,

31:46.791 --> 31:49.636
and we don't have to be
subjected to your tyranny.

31:49.774 --> 31:53.462
Who's being subjected to what, Fisher?

31:54.462 --> 31:57.058
- You've lost one man.
- Yeah. Right.

31:57.158 --> 31:59.267
We've lost five.

32:00.584 --> 32:05.824
Where does it say we gotta keep those
dumb fucks next door to where we sleep?

32:06.124 --> 32:11.129
Where does it say we should do any one
thing but shoot the mothers in the head?

32:11.629 --> 32:15.735
We don't have enough ammunition,
Captain, to shoot them all in the head.

32:15.835 --> 32:18.870
The time to have done that
would've been at the beginning.

32:19.170 --> 32:22.272
No. We let them overrun us.

32:22.872 --> 32:27.568
They have overrun us, you know.
We're in the minority now.

32:28.179 --> 32:31.383
Something like 400,000 to one,
by my calculations.

32:32.583 --> 32:34.385
I haven't eaten. Is there food?

32:34.485 --> 32:38.489
You were supposed to be
here at 7:00 sharp, mister.

32:38.589 --> 32:41.277
I know. Sarah told me. I'm sorry.
I couldn't break away. Is there food?

32:41.377 --> 32:44.031
Listen, egghead, let me bring
you up to date on what's...

32:44.131 --> 32:46.698
- Excuse me. Excuse me!
- Let me...

32:46.998 --> 32:48.272
Is there food?

32:48.672 --> 32:51.573
I'm runnin' this monkey
farm now, Frankenstein!

32:51.673 --> 32:56.856
And I wanna know what the
fuck you're doin' with my time!

33:00.928 --> 33:04.157
'Cause if we're just jerkin' off here,

33:04.257 --> 33:09.420
I'm gonna have my men blow the piss out
of those precious specimens of yours.

33:09.520 --> 33:11.532
And we're gonna get the hell out of here

33:11.632 --> 33:17.495
and leave you and your highfalutin asshole
friends to rot in this stinkin' sewer!

33:17.595 --> 33:20.231
Is that food enough for ya?

33:20.631 --> 33:22.726
Where will you go, Captain?

33:24.177 --> 33:26.019
You can destroy my specimens, but...

33:26.119 --> 33:29.075
what about the millions more that
are waiting to greet you outside?

33:30.375 --> 33:34.482
Do you really think you can
"blow the piss" out of them? All of them?

33:35.482 --> 33:37.784
They have you in a
hopeless situation, strategically.

33:38.784 --> 33:42.364
You're lost. Well, you're lost unless...

33:42.464 --> 33:44.223
Unless what?

33:44.820 --> 33:48.459
- Unless what, Frankenstein?
- Unless you can make them behave.

33:49.277 --> 33:50.869
This is a fuckin' loony bin!

33:50.969 --> 33:53.016
I ain't bein' paid enough to
work in a fuckin' loony bin!

33:53.116 --> 33:56.127
- I ain't bein' paid at all!
- Paid?

33:56.227 --> 33:57.769
What the hell are they payin' him for?

33:58.004 --> 34:02.267
All right. Shut up! Just shut up!

34:04.876 --> 34:08.114
What the hell are you
talkin' about, Frankenstein?

34:08.914 --> 34:11.882
I'll be able to show you
soon enough. Sarah knows.

34:11.983 --> 34:15.522
She's seen the progress I've been making.
Isn't that right, Sarah?

34:16.722 --> 34:19.625
Yes. There's been some progress.

34:19.725 --> 34:22.493
What kind of progress?

34:22.592 --> 34:25.831
What are you talkin' about,
"make them behave"? What does that mean?

34:26.532 --> 34:29.167
It means keeping them from
wanting to eat us, for one thing.

34:29.867 --> 34:35.600
It means keeping them in check.
It's controlling them. Controlling them.

34:35.699 --> 34:38.710
When are you gonna show us
something that we can understand?

34:38.810 --> 34:41.429
Very close. Very close.
I think in a matter of weeks...

34:41.529 --> 34:45.132
I don't think there's any way you can
tell how long anything is going to take.

34:45.232 --> 34:47.077
It could be months; it could be years

34:47.177 --> 34:49.507
before we know exactly what
we're dealing with here.

34:50.784 --> 34:54.125
Sarah's research... Sarah's research...

34:54.864 --> 34:57.545
is more esoteric than mine.

34:57.645 --> 35:01.385
She's looking for a way to reverse
the process, a way to eradicate the problem.

35:02.585 --> 35:05.755
That could take a long time,
a very long time.

35:06.055 --> 35:08.642
She may never find
what she's looking for.

35:09.442 --> 35:11.959
We have a limited supply
of chemical agents.

35:12.059 --> 35:14.862
Our equipment is hopelessly inadequate.

35:15.762 --> 35:19.705
McDermott doesn't have
decent radio gear.

35:20.601 --> 35:24.905
Now you're tellin' me that you
don't have the shit you need?

35:25.005 --> 35:29.694
We're runnin' low on ammunition.
We're runnin' low on men, for chrissakes!

35:29.794 --> 35:34.049
It was very rushed. This operation
was put together in a matter of days.

35:34.149 --> 35:37.720
Yeah, well, it can all be taken apart
in a matter of minutes, lady,

35:37.820 --> 35:41.657
and I'm here to tell you that
I'm ready to do that little thing.

35:41.757 --> 35:44.225
I'm ready to take the
next train outta here!

35:44.325 --> 35:47.528
I ask you again, Captain:
Where will you go?

35:47.928 --> 35:50.266
You have no choices. You'll have to
give us the weeks that we've asked for.

35:50.366 --> 35:53.254
You have to give us
however long it takes.

35:53.435 --> 35:57.138
Look. There have to be
survivors in Washington.

35:57.238 --> 35:59.740
They have more sophisticated
shelters than this one.

35:59.840 --> 36:02.449
There have to be people in those
shelters who know about us,

36:02.550 --> 36:06.282
who know where we are. With no
radio contact, they'll come looking for us.

36:06.382 --> 36:08.956
I said shut up!

36:22.763 --> 36:25.232
You got a little more time.

36:27.768 --> 36:30.473
A little more. I ain't sayin' how much.

36:32.673 --> 36:38.214
But you'd better start showin' me some
results, and you'd better not piss me off.

36:38.314 --> 36:44.186
You understand? Nothin' happens around
here without my knowin' about it!

36:45.886 --> 36:49.115
And anybody fucks with my command,

36:51.008 --> 36:53.620
they get court-martialed,

36:53.920 --> 36:56.297
they get executed.

37:01.719 --> 37:04.775
You'd better know I
mean it, too, people.

37:17.140 --> 37:19.815
He wouldn't have done it.
I can't believe he would've done it.

37:19.915 --> 37:23.174
No, he wouldn't have done it.

37:23.874 --> 37:25.910
He would've had Steel do it.

37:26.410 --> 37:28.199
He can't be that inhuman.

37:28.314 --> 37:33.184
No. He's human.
That's what scares me, you know.

37:34.384 --> 37:38.824
He won't shoot Billy 'cause he doesn't
have anybody else who knows electronics.

37:39.224 --> 37:42.893
He won't shoot me, 'cause I'm his ride.

37:43.293 --> 37:49.100
He probably won't shoot old Frankenstein,
'cause the old doc can talk him silly.

37:49.400 --> 37:50.402
But the rest of you...

37:52.002 --> 37:54.553
better start worrying, you know.

38:01.762 --> 38:05.501
Maybe if we tried working together,
we could ease some of the tensions.

38:05.601 --> 38:07.266
We're all pulling in
different directions.

38:07.366 --> 38:09.879
That's the trouble with
the world, Sarah darling.

38:10.070 --> 38:14.070
People got different ideas concerning
what they want out of life.

38:56.950 --> 39:00.251
You are afraid, aren't you?

39:01.538 --> 39:04.009
Just as afraid as I am.

39:07.428 --> 39:10.247
Why don't you take a sedative,
Sarah, so you can sleep?

39:13.166 --> 39:16.817
You're full of shit, Sarah, you know that?
You're really full of shit.

39:17.523 --> 39:19.472
I'm through with you.

39:19.626 --> 39:21.396
Fine then.

39:22.596 --> 39:24.334
Get out.

39:25.114 --> 39:27.430
Just get out!

40:32.212 --> 40:34.014
Hey, guys! Come on, man!

40:34.676 --> 40:36.114
For God's sake!

40:46.318 --> 40:47.829
I'm all right.

40:47.929 --> 40:51.013
Thanks, Bill. I'm all right.

40:51.833 --> 40:53.110
Here.

40:53.584 --> 40:56.121
I've just filled it up.
Got a refill as well.

40:56.221 --> 40:58.491
No, thanks. I'm all right. Really.

40:58.591 --> 41:01.792
It's just brandy. Good for the heart.

41:01.892 --> 41:04.768
It's shit for your heart,
and it eats up your liver.

41:55.062 --> 41:59.136
We don't get a lot of visitors out here,
and we like it that way.

42:00.267 --> 42:03.706
Here it is: The Ritz.

42:04.206 --> 42:05.731
Madam.

42:13.247 --> 42:15.620
John's probably out the back.

42:26.493 --> 42:28.331
Hey!

42:28.931 --> 42:33.540
Well, what do you know.
Welcome to civilization, Sarah.

42:34.040 --> 42:35.771
The last holdout.

42:35.971 --> 42:37.971
It's pretty nice.

42:39.256 --> 42:41.769
Nicer than we got inside.

42:43.760 --> 42:47.965
- Not a bad idea.
- It's a little safer where you are.

42:48.065 --> 42:50.968
But we like to live dangerously,
Billy boy and me, you know.

42:51.168 --> 42:55.208
That's a laugh. I haven't seen you do
anything dangerous since we got here.

42:55.908 --> 42:57.762
We stickin' around.

42:58.662 --> 43:03.063
That's gettin' a bit dangerous,
as I hope you noticed this evening.

43:08.267 --> 43:09.687
You're a mystery to me.

43:10.987 --> 43:12.636
You really are.

43:14.191 --> 43:17.229
Not like those other goons in there.

43:17.829 --> 43:19.846
You have a sense of...

43:23.051 --> 43:24.554
Of what?

43:25.819 --> 43:27.116
Never mind.

43:27.216 --> 43:29.506
No, no, no. Come on.
Let's talk about it.

43:29.606 --> 43:32.409
I came down here to get drunk.
I don't have the energy.

43:32.509 --> 43:38.250
Hey, hey. It takes more energy to keep
quiet than it does to speak the mind.

43:38.350 --> 43:41.654
Go ahead. Let go of what you got, now.

43:44.420 --> 43:46.023
You were sent down here to do a job.

43:46.223 --> 43:50.828
My job is to fly the whirlybird.
I've been doin' that job just fine.

43:50.928 --> 43:54.366
You have the protection of this facility.
You eat our food. You drink our water.

43:54.466 --> 43:56.472
And you don't lift a finger to help.

43:56.872 --> 43:58.250
Neither one of you.

44:13.250 --> 44:15.624
We don't believe in what
you're doin' here, Sarah.

44:17.354 --> 44:21.558
Hey, you know what all they
keep down here in this cave?

44:21.958 --> 44:27.098
Man, they got the books and the
records of the top 500 companies.

44:27.198 --> 44:30.067
They got the defense
department budget down here.

44:30.367 --> 44:33.570
And they got the negative
for all your favorite movies.

44:33.670 --> 44:38.477
They got microfilm with tax
return and newspaper stories.

44:38.777 --> 44:41.145
They got immigration records,
census reports,

44:41.245 --> 44:44.583
and they got official accounts of
all the wars and plane crashes

44:44.683 --> 44:48.552
and volcano eruptions and
earthquakes and fires and floods

44:48.652 --> 44:52.190
and all the other disasters that
interrupted the flow of things

44:52.290 --> 44:54.759
in the good old U.S. of A.

44:55.959 --> 44:59.463
Now, what does it matter, Sarah darling?

44:59.563 --> 45:02.249
All this filing and record keeping?

45:02.549 --> 45:07.279
We ever gonna give a shit? We even
gonna get a chance to see it all?

45:09.489 --> 45:13.721
This is a great big 14-mile tombstone!

45:16.696 --> 45:20.751
With an epitaph on it that
nobody gonna bother to read.

45:21.051 --> 45:24.790
Now, here you come... here you
come with a whole new set of charts

45:24.890 --> 45:28.755
and graphs and records.
What you gonna do?

45:28.855 --> 45:33.449
Bury them down here with all
the other relics of what once was?

45:35.949 --> 45:39.787
Let me tell you what else.
Yeah, I'm gonna tell you what else.

45:40.187 --> 45:43.169
You ain't never gonna figure it out,

45:43.469 --> 45:48.837
just like they never figured out why
the stars are where they're at.

45:49.195 --> 45:53.200
It ain't mankind's job
to figure that stuff out.

45:53.800 --> 45:57.020
So what you're doin' is
a waste of time, Sarah.

45:57.120 --> 45:59.708
And time is all we got left, you know.

46:01.208 --> 46:03.058
What I'm doing...

46:04.858 --> 46:08.562
- is all there's left to do.
- Shame on you.

46:08.762 --> 46:11.862
There's plenty to do. Plenty to do.

46:12.662 --> 46:15.506
So long as there's you and me
and maybe some other people,

46:15.606 --> 46:20.235
we could start over,
start fresh, get some babies.

46:20.435 --> 46:24.650
And teach 'em, Sarah,
teach 'em never to come over here

46:24.750 --> 46:27.491
and dig these records out.

46:32.456 --> 46:33.958
Hey.

46:35.258 --> 46:37.383
You want to put some kind of...

46:37.598 --> 46:39.765
explanation...

46:40.465 --> 46:42.426
down here before you leave?

46:43.817 --> 46:47.353
Here's one as good as
any you're likely to find.

46:50.524 --> 46:53.582
We're being punished by the creator.

46:56.429 --> 46:59.433
He visited a curse on us...

47:00.933 --> 47:02.760
so we man could look at...

47:09.643 --> 47:11.752
what hell was like.

47:15.148 --> 47:19.187
Maybe didn't want to see
us blow ourselves up...

47:19.287 --> 47:21.777
and put a big hole in his sky.

47:23.356 --> 47:26.711
Maybe he just wanted to show
us he was still the boss man.

47:28.396 --> 47:34.233
Maybe he figure... we was getting
too big for our britches...

47:35.268 --> 47:38.497
trying to figure his shit out.

48:30.189 --> 48:32.485
You son of a bitch!

48:36.295 --> 48:37.716
Damn it!

48:40.005 --> 48:42.102
It's no good.

48:42.602 --> 48:46.200
- It's no fuckin' good.
- What is that stuff?

48:46.707 --> 48:48.084
It's something called beef treats,

48:48.184 --> 48:51.216
which the army provides
us with so generously.

48:51.711 --> 48:54.349
- He won't touch it.
- Shit. I wouldn't either.

48:54.549 --> 48:57.417
Sorry. We're fresh out of filet mignon.

48:58.896 --> 49:02.887
What is this? Part of Logan's plan
to try and socialize these things?

49:04.124 --> 49:06.528
He told me himself they
don't eat for nourishment.

49:07.328 --> 49:08.905
What are we hoping for here?

49:09.005 --> 49:12.918
Hoping to satisfy the urge.
You see, Sarah, they're...

49:13.218 --> 49:16.786
they are us. They are
the extensions of us.

49:17.386 --> 49:22.025
They are the same animal,
simply functioning less perfectly.

49:22.525 --> 49:24.035
They can be fooled, don't you see?

49:24.435 --> 49:27.673
They can be tricked into being
good little girls and boys,

49:27.781 --> 49:31.686
the same way we were tricked into it
on the promise of some reward to come.

49:33.154 --> 49:37.692
They have to be rewarded. Reward is
the key. I'm convinced of that now.

49:38.092 --> 49:40.165
Come. I've got something to show you.

49:48.818 --> 49:52.864
That wasn't very nice, you know.
That wasn't very nice at all.

49:53.523 --> 49:54.780
Let's go.

49:57.044 --> 50:01.865
And you can just sit there in the dark
and think about what you've done.

50:02.265 --> 50:05.478
Think about it. Think.

50:19.474 --> 50:21.385
I call him Bub.

50:21.885 --> 50:23.782
That's what the club fellas
used to call my father.

50:24.582 --> 50:26.940
Can you imagine a surgeon called Bub?

50:27.892 --> 50:33.146
Nobody seemed to mind, though.
He was rich. My father was rich.

50:33.846 --> 50:37.886
He used to say I'd never be
rich doing pure research.

50:38.947 --> 50:41.054
I'd never be rich.

50:41.554 --> 50:44.895
Bub's been responding so
well lately, I've let him live.

50:48.392 --> 50:52.900
Well, is he alive or dead? Well,
that's the question these days, isn't it?

50:53.000 --> 50:56.169
Well, let's say that I let
him continue to exist.

50:57.205 --> 50:59.141
Hello, Bub!

51:00.773 --> 51:02.474
Here are some toys for you.

51:04.462 --> 51:08.341
Some nice things for you to play with.

51:10.884 --> 51:12.352
You remember them from before?

51:13.942 --> 51:15.376
From before.

51:20.994 --> 51:23.052
Well, he's seen the other things before,
but the book is new.

51:35.739 --> 51:37.498
Look, look, look.

52:10.560 --> 52:12.411
I thought he'd do that.

52:25.609 --> 52:26.773
Open it up.

52:31.814 --> 52:34.643
He remembers. He remembers
everything that he used to.

52:38.955 --> 52:43.785
Bub, I'm very pleased. Very pleased.

52:44.495 --> 52:46.763
What's he trying to prove?

52:47.563 --> 52:49.866
I saw one of those things
sittin' in a car in D. C.

52:49.966 --> 52:52.769
tryin' to drive down
Independence Avenue.

52:53.069 --> 52:54.818
It didn't make me wanna be its friend.

52:54.918 --> 52:58.710
No. It's amazing. It's not what this
one does, but what he doesn't do.

52:58.810 --> 53:01.077
- What do you mean?
- He doesn't get excited

53:01.177 --> 53:04.316
and doesn't get agitated when
Logan walks in the room.

53:04.816 --> 53:07.002
He doesn't see Logan as...

53:08.002 --> 53:09.186
Lunch.

53:09.286 --> 53:11.990
- Dinner.
- Breakfast.

53:13.089 --> 53:14.510
Having fun?

53:16.257 --> 53:17.948
What's he doin' in there?

53:20.980 --> 53:22.683
No need for that, Captain.
He's quite docile.

53:23.683 --> 53:27.321
Come in. You can all come in.

53:27.653 --> 53:29.052
Bub won't mind.

53:56.265 --> 53:58.420
Extraordinary, isn't it?

54:09.679 --> 54:12.882
That's right, Bub. Say hello.

54:12.982 --> 54:15.220
Come on, Captain.
Give me a break, will ya?

54:15.720 --> 54:18.150
Say hello to your aunt Alicia.

54:19.424 --> 54:21.716
Say, "Hello, aunt Alicia."

54:22.992 --> 54:25.695
"Hello, aunt Alicia."

54:26.145 --> 54:31.126
- Hel-lo, aunt Alicia.
- "Hello."

54:46.216 --> 54:48.279
Apparently, he was in the military.

54:48.579 --> 54:51.164
Return the salute and see what he does.

54:51.456 --> 54:55.760
You want me to salute
that pile of walking pus?

54:56.060 --> 54:57.928
Salute my ass.

54:58.028 --> 55:01.312
Your ignorance is exceeded
only by your charm, Captain.

55:03.032 --> 55:07.237
How are we going to set an example for
them if we behave barbarically ourselves?

55:08.170 --> 55:10.738
Take the bullets out, please,
and let me have your pistol, Sarah.

55:45.324 --> 55:48.027
It's empty, Captain.
We saw the bullets come out.

55:48.827 --> 55:52.179
Let's see what he does. Let's see
what Bub does in this situation.

56:03.410 --> 56:05.461
Jesus...

56:06.261 --> 56:07.596
Christ.

56:21.961 --> 56:24.337
What are we supposed to do?

56:24.937 --> 56:26.848
Teach 'em tricks?

56:27.967 --> 56:32.056
What the fuck is wrong with
you people? They're dead!

56:32.556 --> 56:37.176
They're fucking dead,
and you wanna teach 'em tricks?

56:37.576 --> 56:41.416
They have to be rewarded, Captain.
Why else will they do what we want them to do?

56:41.616 --> 56:43.933
I don't want 'em to do
anything but drop over!

56:44.033 --> 56:46.671
Yes, well, apparently they're not
inclined to do that for you, Captain.

56:46.771 --> 56:49.764
Is this your progress?

56:50.590 --> 56:54.193
Is this the shit that's supposed
to knock our socks off?

56:54.793 --> 56:56.825
It's the beginning, yes.

56:57.825 --> 57:00.600
It's the bare beginning
of social behavior.

57:00.700 --> 57:02.910
Of civilized behavior.

57:03.803 --> 57:07.442
Civil behavior is what distinguishes
us from the lower forms.

57:08.542 --> 57:11.483
It's what enables us to communicate,

57:12.111 --> 57:14.104
to go about things in
an orderly fashion,

57:14.204 --> 57:16.988
without attacking each
other like beasts in the wild.

57:17.834 --> 57:21.899
Civility must be rewarded, Captain.

57:23.039 --> 57:25.209
If it isn't rewarded,

57:26.527 --> 57:28.606
there's no use for it.

57:29.145 --> 57:31.554
There's just no use for it at all.

57:43.286 --> 57:44.548
'Possum ready?

57:47.964 --> 57:50.402
Come on. Grab it. Come on.

57:50.502 --> 57:51.876
You got it?

57:52.738 --> 57:53.580
Hey.

57:54.901 --> 57:56.288
You got it?

58:07.533 --> 58:08.688
No!

58:18.620 --> 58:21.114
No! No!

58:21.347 --> 58:24.100
Miller! Miller!

58:32.142 --> 58:34.059
I can't do it.

58:34.159 --> 58:38.146
I can't do it!

58:39.837 --> 58:42.387
I can't do it.

59:04.540 --> 59:06.971
Don't let this happen.

59:07.844 --> 59:12.667
Don't let this happen to me.
I don't wanna be one of them.

59:12.767 --> 59:16.219
Take me. Please. Take me.

01:00:12.141 --> 01:00:13.787
I need fire.

01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:12.091
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

01:01:24.116 --> 01:01:26.728
- Get out of the way, lady.
- No.

01:01:26.828 --> 01:01:30.086
I amputated the infected area.
I think I caught it in time.

01:01:30.486 --> 01:01:33.292
Yeah? But what if you didn't?

01:01:33.489 --> 01:01:36.410
If I didn't, I'll shoot him myself.

01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:39.573
It's the spic.
The yellow son of a bitch.

01:01:39.673 --> 01:01:43.184
It's his fault this happened.
It's his yellow fuckin' fault.

01:01:44.084 --> 01:01:47.100
Get out of the way, bitch,
or I'll go right through you with this.

01:01:52.757 --> 01:01:57.106
We're getting to make this a habit, man...
pointing guns at each other, you know.

01:01:57.506 --> 01:01:59.849
We just lost two men
'cause of this motherfucker.

01:01:59.949 --> 01:02:03.953
Well... that kinda evens
the odds between us then.

01:02:04.853 --> 01:02:08.410
The spic's been bit, Captain.
We gotta blast him. He's been bit!

01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:11.944
- I got the infection in time.
- That's bullshit, lady.

01:02:13.663 --> 01:02:17.751
I seen a thousand of 'em.
He's gonna die.

01:02:18.551 --> 01:02:21.255
If he dies, I'll destroy him myself.

01:02:21.355 --> 01:02:23.412
Unless he gets you first.

01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:29.047
You may still want to sleep with him.

01:02:29.647 --> 01:02:32.251
I don't want him inside the complex.

01:02:32.532 --> 01:02:35.005
We'll keep him out here, with us.

01:02:36.085 --> 01:02:38.699
We gotta blast him, Captain.

01:02:48.414 --> 01:02:50.968
That'd be doin' 'im a favor, Steel.

01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:55.306
You think he wants to walk
around after he's dead?

01:02:55.406 --> 01:02:58.180
You think he wants to
be one of those things?

01:02:59.608 --> 01:03:01.782
Think about it, lady.

01:03:02.378 --> 01:03:04.964
And think about this, all of ya...

01:03:05.381 --> 01:03:08.884
from now on, you ain't gettin'
shit from me and my men.

01:03:09.584 --> 01:03:12.765
Tomorrow morning, we're going inside
that corral, and we ain't comin' out

01:03:12.865 --> 01:03:17.224
till every one of those rotten
piles of garbage has been wasted.

01:03:21.864 --> 01:03:23.556
Come on, Steel.

01:03:32.975 --> 01:03:36.652
Get out of there, Steel!
We got better things to do!

01:03:41.484 --> 01:03:44.191
You're on my shit list, flyboy.

01:04:02.204 --> 01:04:03.611
Thank you.

01:04:05.608 --> 01:04:08.446
Let's take him inside, clean him up.

01:04:08.546 --> 01:04:10.591
Think you can move him?

01:04:13.115 --> 01:04:14.916
I-I think so.

01:04:34.437 --> 01:04:37.467
It's all right. It's okay.

01:05:05.034 --> 01:05:09.287
- It's a man's sweater. Try it on.
- Thanks.

01:05:14.443 --> 01:05:16.691
I have to go to the lab.

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:20.650
He's going to need some morphine...

01:05:21.650 --> 01:05:23.252
along with some other supplies.

01:05:23.852 --> 01:05:28.345
I'd better go along. I'm sure those boys
haven't calmed themselves down yet.

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:33.896
I'm sorry I said those things about you.

01:05:34.696 --> 01:05:37.234
I'm sorry too. Really.

01:05:37.734 --> 01:05:39.954
McDERMOTT: Well, what do you know?

01:05:40.054 --> 01:05:43.933
We are heroes after all. What a relief.

01:05:57.720 --> 01:05:58.572
Sarah.

01:06:01.422 --> 01:06:03.260
He might not make it, you know.

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.582
I know it.

01:06:07.629 --> 01:06:09.266
At least we gave him a chance.

01:06:10.666 --> 01:06:12.069
I'll keep an eye on him.

01:06:12.769 --> 01:06:16.271
Hey. You guys be careful.

01:06:16.371 --> 01:06:18.776
You're not back in half an hour,
I'm coming out to look for you.

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:21.313
They'll leave us alone.

01:06:24.346 --> 01:06:25.733
Half an hour.

01:06:26.583 --> 01:06:28.085
We'll be back.

01:06:50.723 --> 01:06:53.075
Jesus God almighty.

01:06:54.125 --> 01:06:57.636
The resident surgeon has been
burning the midnight oils.

01:07:04.436 --> 01:07:07.640
What the hell has he been doin'
down here, slaughtering cattle?

01:07:07.890 --> 01:07:10.903
In his mind, that's probably
not far from the truth.

01:07:32.731 --> 01:07:37.249
<i>Grandfather's talking. His mind's talking.
There. I've put it away.</i>

01:07:38.099 --> 01:07:40.777
<i>I've put it away, mother.
I've put it away.</i>

01:07:42.541 --> 01:07:45.592
<i>Bastard. Be civilized!</i>

01:07:45.830 --> 01:07:50.149
<i>Be civil... lized! Take that off.</i>

01:07:50.249 --> 01:07:54.042
<i>Take that off! Take that off!</i>

01:07:55.339 --> 01:07:59.175
<i>Five minutes, mother.
Just five minutes.</i>

01:08:00.593 --> 01:08:02.560
Oh, my God.

01:08:05.112 --> 01:08:07.393
Oh, my God.

01:08:13.449 --> 01:08:16.544
No, Sarah! Don't! It'll just
bring out Rhodes and the men.

01:08:16.644 --> 01:08:19.388
Leave it be, leave it be.

01:08:21.462 --> 01:08:24.687
Let's go. Let's get outta here.

01:08:25.537 --> 01:08:29.792
I'm beginning to think we should take that
helicopter before somebody else does.

01:08:50.694 --> 01:08:52.872
Hello, Bub.

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:02.106
Mother is very proud of you.

01:09:02.206 --> 01:09:04.975
Very, very proud indeed.

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:07.810
You did quite nicely today.

01:10:35.588 --> 01:10:37.693
I don't believe it.

01:10:37.793 --> 01:10:39.543
Logan's star pupil.

01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:45.479
Now, tomorrow, we can play
with these things again.

01:10:47.175 --> 01:10:50.138
Now it's time for your reward.

01:10:51.714 --> 01:10:54.160
I brought you something good.

01:11:10.399 --> 01:11:12.636
What is that?

01:11:14.227 --> 01:11:15.192
Is that...

01:11:19.130 --> 01:11:21.285
it can't be.

01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:23.817
Oh, God.

01:11:23.917 --> 01:11:26.737
Oh, Jesus. I can't...

01:11:36.090 --> 01:11:37.524
Good night, Bub.

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:40.934
What are you givin' him
in there, Frankenstein?

01:11:41.084 --> 01:11:42.092
What?

01:11:43.858 --> 01:11:45.758
What is it?

01:11:47.970 --> 01:11:49.671
What do you give him?

01:12:03.401 --> 01:12:04.486
Scum!

01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:08.826
No, you... you must listen to me,
Captain. You must listen!

01:12:08.974 --> 01:12:10.553
Listen to this.

01:12:19.417 --> 01:12:23.274
Hold it, Fisher. Torrez, get his gun.

01:12:23.674 --> 01:12:24.820
Take all the guns.

01:12:26.224 --> 01:12:27.702
All of 'em.

01:12:28.202 --> 01:12:32.415
All their fucking guns!
Take all their guns.

01:12:32.515 --> 01:12:34.500
All their guns!

01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:38.362
Those are my men in there.

01:12:39.121 --> 01:12:40.809
My men.

01:12:40.909 --> 01:12:43.224
Those are my men in there!

01:13:39.851 --> 01:13:41.320
Hold it right there.

01:13:44.486 --> 01:13:46.989
Frankenstein's dead.

01:13:48.020 --> 01:13:51.528
This scum gets it next unless you
throw your weapons out right now.

01:13:51.828 --> 01:13:53.940
He means it, Johnny.
He killed Logan in cold blood.

01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:57.142
I killed Logan because he was a butcher.

01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.732
I'll kill the rest of
them one at a time,

01:13:59.832 --> 01:14:02.886
unless you get your black
ass out here, flyboy.

01:14:20.272 --> 01:14:22.153
Let him go, Rhodes.

01:14:22.553 --> 01:14:25.453
Torrez, get his machete.

01:14:28.180 --> 01:14:30.682
We're gettin' outta here right now.

01:14:31.082 --> 01:14:34.220
You give me any shit about it,
I blow his head off.

01:14:34.562 --> 01:14:36.088
Whirlybird can't hold us all.

01:14:36.188 --> 01:14:41.386
"Us all" ain't going.
Me, my men, you. That's it.

01:14:42.136 --> 01:14:43.721
You'll never get me to do that, Rhodes.

01:14:46.848 --> 01:14:49.301
- No!
- Hey!

01:14:49.551 --> 01:14:51.567
Rickles, open the gates.

01:14:52.908 --> 01:14:55.211
Steel, shove 'em in there.

01:15:00.780 --> 01:15:03.640
Have a nice visit with McDermott, huh?

01:15:10.671 --> 01:15:11.882
Rhodes...

01:15:13.029 --> 01:15:15.387
don't do this, please.

01:15:16.137 --> 01:15:18.032
Gonna give us a ride, flyboy?

01:15:18.132 --> 01:15:20.665
I'll do whatever you say, man.

01:15:21.175 --> 01:15:22.315
Let her go now.

01:15:28.957 --> 01:15:31.969
Rhodes. Let 'em off.

01:15:32.674 --> 01:15:36.365
I'll take you...
wherever you want to go.

01:15:36.665 --> 01:15:40.972
Like you said,
chopper can't hold us all.

01:15:44.673 --> 01:15:46.991
Rhodes, don't do it.

01:15:47.876 --> 01:15:50.361
You do it, and I won't fly.

01:15:51.404 --> 01:15:54.698
I swear, you got to
kill me before I fly.

01:15:59.170 --> 01:16:00.873
Let 'em out.

01:16:01.662 --> 01:16:03.444
That's the deal.

01:16:05.494 --> 01:16:09.698
I make the deals around here, not you.

01:16:10.593 --> 01:16:13.687
Now you get your shit together,
whatever you need.

01:16:14.437 --> 01:16:18.087
- Isn't there an old silo back there?
- No. We can't go back there without guns.

01:16:18.187 --> 01:16:19.850
We can't stay here.
They'll tear us apart.

01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:22.197
Oh, Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

01:16:24.913 --> 01:16:25.959
Don't shoot 'im!

01:16:29.519 --> 01:16:31.316
We need his ass.

01:16:33.946 --> 01:16:35.978
Steel, kick him around a little bit.

01:16:38.076 --> 01:16:42.053
Might knock some sense into
that jungle-bunny head.

01:16:51.573 --> 01:16:53.088
Captain!

01:16:55.263 --> 01:16:58.265
That's it. Run, you fuckin' lunatics.

01:17:28.822 --> 01:17:32.699
They're gone, flyboy. Let's go.

01:17:33.663 --> 01:17:35.717
Not a chance.

01:17:39.871 --> 01:17:43.284
- Jesus Christ. That's the elevator.
- Check it out.

01:18:35.066 --> 01:18:38.681
- Aw, Jesus.
- Rock slide. We can't get through.

01:18:40.081 --> 01:18:41.985
This way. We can try and get around.

01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:32.706
- Oh, it's you.
- This way.

01:19:42.294 --> 01:19:44.041
Let's go, Torrez. Get up.

01:20:26.954 --> 01:20:29.407
Shit! Somebody took this apart.

01:20:29.507 --> 01:20:33.196
The only other control's up on
the platform with a hand box.

01:20:34.518 --> 01:20:36.264
Oh, Jesus.

01:20:36.664 --> 01:20:41.254
- Rickles, we can't get out of here.
- Fix it. Can't you fix it?

01:20:41.354 --> 01:20:44.825
- It's that fuckin' spic that did this!
- Fix it!

01:20:45.759 --> 01:20:48.276
- Come on, man!
- Fix what?

01:20:48.376 --> 01:20:50.918
Fix... fix the box, man!
Come on, fix it!

01:20:51.018 --> 01:20:53.878
Fix what? They tore the fucking
guts out of it, Rickles! I can't fix it!

01:20:53.978 --> 01:20:56.319
We got the book here! We can fix it!

01:21:08.794 --> 01:21:10.500
The bastard.

01:21:23.444 --> 01:21:25.798
Sarah!

01:21:26.431 --> 01:21:28.171
Billy!

01:21:31.458 --> 01:21:32.790
John!

01:21:58.463 --> 01:22:00.170
Let's keep moving.

01:23:19.181 --> 01:23:22.371
- Hold down. Fuck!
- What's goin' on?

01:23:22.471 --> 01:23:26.719
That spic. He ripped these controls out,
the little yellow bastard.

01:23:27.335 --> 01:23:29.703
The little shit.

01:23:30.855 --> 01:23:33.858
The little fuckin' shit.

01:23:34.514 --> 01:23:36.666
You tried to make a run for it.

01:24:11.079 --> 01:24:13.581
Holy shit!

01:24:13.831 --> 01:24:16.009
Holy fuckin' shit.

01:24:42.711 --> 01:24:44.999
Rhodes!

01:24:45.109 --> 01:24:48.279
Rhodes, you bastard!

01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:17.764
Oh, shit!

01:27:24.463 --> 01:27:26.263
Shit!

01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:30.982
Fuck!

01:27:42.523 --> 01:27:44.393
Holy shit!

01:28:30.388 --> 01:28:32.056
Shit!

01:28:33.941 --> 01:28:35.532
Rhodes!

01:28:35.632 --> 01:28:39.513
Goddamn, Rhodes!
Open the door, you son of a bitch!

01:28:40.799 --> 01:28:43.275
Rhodes!

01:29:33.334 --> 01:29:34.718
Shit!

01:29:43.911 --> 01:29:46.464
Come on, Bub.

01:29:46.564 --> 01:29:49.719
Come on, you pus-brained bag of shit.

01:29:50.368 --> 01:29:54.656
You wanna learn how to shoot, Bub?
I'll teach you how to shoot.

01:29:54.756 --> 01:29:57.449
Come on, you bag of...

01:30:56.934 --> 01:30:59.480
Let's go. Follow the red lights.

01:31:13.894 --> 01:31:18.987
- It's temporarily out of service.
- The ladder! Go ahead. Up, up. Up!

01:31:51.905 --> 01:31:57.266
Come along, Johnny. We're countin'
on ya to fly us to the promised land.

01:32:35.349 --> 01:32:38.571
Come on, come on. Come on!

01:32:38.821 --> 01:32:40.457
Oh, shit!

01:32:55.654 --> 01:32:57.444
You fuck.

01:33:08.365 --> 01:33:10.258
You pus fuck!

01:33:10.789 --> 01:33:11.858
You fuck!

01:33:13.921 --> 01:33:17.860
You pus fuck! You pus fu...!

01:33:26.634 --> 01:33:28.072
You f...

01:33:41.254 --> 01:33:42.935
Come on!

01:33:44.218 --> 01:33:47.970
Come on! Come on!

01:33:50.007 --> 01:33:52.135
Come on!

01:33:54.461 --> 01:33:56.588
Come on!

01:33:59.766 --> 01:34:01.585
Come on!

01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:04.922
Come on!

01:34:51.780 --> 01:34:54.717
Choke on 'em!

01:34:54.817 --> 01:34:57.916
Choke on 'em!

01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:17.756
Let's hope they filled up the
gas tank from the other night.

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:21.830
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, come on!

01:36:36.605 --> 01:36:38.542
Get in, get in!

01:39:14.882 --> 01:39:16.784
<i>Eyes</i>

01:39:16.884 --> 01:39:19.297
<i>Eyes, eyes</i>

01:39:19.397 --> 01:39:23.430
<i>Is it you</i>

01:39:23.530 --> 01:39:27.344
<i>Is it me</i>

01:39:27.444 --> 01:39:31.928
<i>Holding on for so long</i>

01:39:32.028 --> 01:39:36.121
<i>Trying desperately</i>

01:39:36.221 --> 01:39:39.490
<i>Is it right</i>

01:39:39.740 --> 01:39:44.028
<i>Oh-oh-oh, is it fair</i>

01:39:44.128 --> 01:39:48.282
<i>Wanting more, so much more</i>

01:39:48.382 --> 01:39:52.336
<i>And it's never there</i>

01:39:52.436 --> 01:39:56.416
<i>I am with you when</i>

01:39:56.516 --> 01:39:59.442
<i>I feel like</i>

01:39:59.542 --> 01:40:02.804
<i>I'm alone</i>

01:40:02.904 --> 01:40:06.416
<i>It's easy to pretend</i>

01:40:06.516 --> 01:40:10.104
<i>This world could never end</i>

01:40:10.204 --> 01:40:15.270
<i>Come take my heart, my soul, my love</i>

01:40:15.370 --> 01:40:18.727
<i>My life</i>

01:40:18.827 --> 01:40:22.755
<i>Tonight
Love me</i>

01:40:23.316 --> 01:40:26.804
<i>Tonight, babe</i>

01:40:26.904 --> 01:40:30.993
<i>Take me to the world inside</i>

01:40:31.093 --> 01:40:34.905
<i>Your eyes</i>

01:40:35.005 --> 01:40:38.848
<i>Tonight</i>

01:40:39.305 --> 01:40:45.353
