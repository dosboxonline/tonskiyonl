00:10.720 --> 00:13.520
[guest]
Lord Barton, you are a rake. A cad.

00:13.520 --> 00:15.320
You have dishonoured my sister.

00:15.320 --> 00:19.080
[Barton] Lord Galpin, remind me
to which dishonouring are you referring?

00:19.680 --> 00:21.080
The one in the kitchen?

00:21.080 --> 00:23.000
In your study?

00:23.000 --> 00:24.080
In the stables?

00:24.080 --> 00:25.800
You will marry her, sir!

00:26.400 --> 00:27.960
I will do no such thing.

00:29.360 --> 00:32.680
Now, I'm awfully bored of your shouting.

00:32.680 --> 00:36.680
If you wish to challenge me to a duel,
then please, sir, do.

00:37.320 --> 00:39.240
Then I can shoot you dead.

00:41.320 --> 00:42.640
[bones click]

00:43.160 --> 00:48.200
Wow. You really are
wonderfully bad, aren't you?

00:48.960 --> 00:49.960
Beg your pardon?

00:49.960 --> 00:54.120
Oh, you gamble, have affairs.
You're an absolute snake.

00:55.120 --> 00:57.680
Meanwhile, I'm all noble and serious.

00:57.680 --> 00:58.920
Look at me.

00:58.920 --> 01:01.200
I'm so dull.

01:03.000 --> 01:04.280
I'd rather be you.

01:05.160 --> 01:06.160
Unhand me!

01:06.160 --> 01:07.600
What are you-- [grunts]

01:07.600 --> 01:10.000
That's impossible! [grunting]

01:10.000 --> 01:12.080
[screaming]

01:12.080 --> 01:13.760
- [grunts]
- [body thuds]

01:18.640 --> 01:21.960
[sniffs, sighs]

01:21.960 --> 01:23.960
Now I get to be the bad one.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.840
[theme song playing]

01:59.920 --> 02:02.280
[chamber music playing]

02:10.120 --> 02:11.280
[Ruby giggling]

02:20.240 --> 02:22.040
Oh, my <i>Bridgerton</i>. [chuckles]

02:22.040 --> 02:23.200
This is my actual dream.

02:23.200 --> 02:24.880
- It's brilliant, isn't it?
- [chuckles]

02:24.880 --> 02:26.480
And the dances. [chuckling]

02:26.480 --> 02:27.560
Oh, Ruby, the dances.

02:27.560 --> 02:29.240
I can't dance. Not like this.

02:29.240 --> 02:31.640
- How do I know these moves?
- Psychic earrings.

02:31.640 --> 02:34.120
Choreography beamed
into your motor system.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.760
Tap twice to choose your moves.

02:35.760 --> 02:38.320
It's like instant <i>Strictly</i>.

02:38.880 --> 02:40.120
- [applause]
- [giggles]

02:40.120 --> 02:41.840
Just don't set them to battle mode.

02:41.840 --> 02:43.440
[clicks tongue] Right.

02:43.440 --> 02:45.200
Marvellous.

02:45.200 --> 02:48.280
Well, I thought I knew everyone
at my ball, but it appears not.

02:48.280 --> 02:49.360
What a delight.

02:49.360 --> 02:50.920
Wonderful party, Your Grace.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.760
[chuckles]
Some are saying best of the season.

02:52.760 --> 02:54.000
A triumph.

02:54.000 --> 02:55.800
- A new standard set. [chuckles]
- [Ruby] Mmm.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.520
I, of course, could not comment.

02:57.520 --> 03:01.920
But I think the real estimation
of an evening is in the matches made.

03:01.920 --> 03:03.480
Don't you agree, Miss...

03:03.480 --> 03:04.680
Uh, Ruby.

03:04.680 --> 03:09.200
Lady Ruby Sunday
of the Notting Hill estate.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.280
[Doctor chuckles]

03:11.160 --> 03:12.160
This is the Doctor.

03:12.160 --> 03:13.880
Oh, my dear, you aren't unwell?

03:13.880 --> 03:15.520
- Oh, no, no. He's just a friend.
- Mmm.

03:15.520 --> 03:16.840
[duchess] Oh, good. [chuckles]

03:16.840 --> 03:20.520
Well, a young lady needs suitors,
not friends. Come.

03:21.280 --> 03:23.880
- Oh. Oh, she's so posh. I love her.
- [Doctor chuckles]

03:23.880 --> 03:25.480
- [feedback reverberates]
- Oh. [stammers]

03:25.480 --> 03:27.320
- I'm getting feedback.
- On the earrings?

03:27.320 --> 03:28.840
[feedback pulsating]

03:30.160 --> 03:31.520
Ooh, interesting.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.440
Sonar interference.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.320
[duchess] Lady Ruby, attend.

03:35.320 --> 03:36.760
Uh, s-- I'll handle this.

03:36.760 --> 03:39.720
Just-just try not to get engaged
or accidentally invent tarmac.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.480
1902 got away from me.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.680
- [inhales sharply]
- Okay, go, go, go. Enjoy.

03:49.760 --> 03:52.680
[the sonic whirring, beeping]

04:01.360 --> 04:03.800
[whirring continues]

04:14.200 --> 04:16.680
My dear, stand tall, eyes bright.

04:16.680 --> 04:18.080
Lord Barton approaches.

04:18.080 --> 04:19.760
Ooh, that's a tall glass of heartbreak.

04:22.560 --> 04:27.520
Your Grace, where have you been
hiding this absolute delight?

04:27.520 --> 04:31.400
With hair like golden strands
spun in the rays of the evening sun.

04:32.360 --> 04:35.440
Oh, you're not a tall glass at all,
you're half a pint of shandy.

04:36.080 --> 04:39.960
My dear,
you should learn to be admired in silence.

04:39.960 --> 04:44.040
[smacks lips] Yeah, well,
if you spoke to me and the girls like that

04:44.040 --> 04:45.920
on a Friday night
down at the Spinning Wheel,

04:45.920 --> 04:47.360
then we'd rip you a new one, mate.

04:48.560 --> 04:51.320
[upper-class accent]
Now get out of my way, Lord Stilton.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.520
Stilton?

04:56.320 --> 04:58.600
It's a very difficult cheese.

04:59.960 --> 05:00.960
[huffs]

05:01.560 --> 05:02.560
[bones click]

05:10.400 --> 05:11.440
[scoffs]

05:13.000 --> 05:16.000
Oh, uh, Your Grace. Who is that?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.480
The Duke's late mother.

05:17.480 --> 05:19.280
Her eyes still follow me about the room.

05:20.080 --> 05:21.240
Constant judgement.

05:21.240 --> 05:22.560
- [Ruby exhales]
- But, my dear,

05:22.560 --> 05:25.560
the way you spoke to Lord Barton,
you were rather splendid.

05:25.560 --> 05:26.920
Is it always like that in the North?

05:26.920 --> 05:28.840
Oh, well,
fellas like that are ten a penny.

05:28.840 --> 05:30.800
Oh, he's moved on.

05:31.320 --> 05:32.840
Who's he with now?

05:32.840 --> 05:35.200
[duchess] Miss Emily Beckett.

05:35.200 --> 05:38.000
She's bookish and vapid, I fear,
but good teeth.

05:38.720 --> 05:40.120
Oh, by the Saints! Lady Wallace.

05:40.120 --> 05:41.200
No, no, no!

05:41.200 --> 05:42.520
- Wait here, dear.
- Mm-hmm.

05:43.080 --> 05:46.120
[duchess] Excuse me.
Oh, no. Not now, Lord-- [stammers]

06:04.400 --> 06:07.280
[orchestra playing "Bad Guy"]

06:16.720 --> 06:18.920
Brooding. Good look.

06:19.640 --> 06:21.040
Do you practise in the mirror?

06:21.920 --> 06:23.640
Bit more frown maybe.

06:24.880 --> 06:25.880
Yeah? Like this.

06:28.480 --> 06:30.960
Yeah? Like this, really.
Really, like this.

06:31.480 --> 06:32.720
[inhales sharply]

06:32.720 --> 06:34.840
I didn't know
the duchess employs a court jester.

06:34.840 --> 06:36.200
Well, I'm hilarious.

06:37.000 --> 06:40.560
And you're kind of funny.

06:40.560 --> 06:41.720
Peculiar.

06:42.720 --> 06:43.720
Standing here.

06:44.920 --> 06:45.960
Good vantage point.

06:45.960 --> 06:50.080
Keeping an eye out on the exits,
like you're expecting trouble.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.400
Are you?

06:53.400 --> 06:55.000
Honey, I'm here for fun.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.400
Then go and pursue your facile pleasures,
and leave me alone.

06:58.400 --> 07:01.640
Okay, rude.

07:01.640 --> 07:03.480
- Lord...
- Not a Lord.

07:03.480 --> 07:05.120
Does not-a-Lord have a name?

07:05.120 --> 07:06.240
Rogue.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.400
Nice to meet you.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.520
I'm the Doctor.

07:09.520 --> 07:10.880
Just the Doctor?

07:10.880 --> 07:12.080
Just Rogue?

07:21.640 --> 07:23.400
I think you and I should go outside.

07:28.600 --> 07:29.600
Fast mover.

07:30.160 --> 07:31.520
[inhales deeply]

07:31.520 --> 07:33.480
Okay. [clears throat]

07:34.120 --> 07:36.400
- [duchess] Lady Wallace.
- Yes, I think so. [chuckles]

07:36.400 --> 07:38.160
- Lady Wallace.
- Yes?

07:39.120 --> 07:41.400
How brave of you
to wear that gown this evening,

07:41.400 --> 07:44.200
after I wore it so beautifully
last season.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.360
[Wallace gasps, scoffs]

07:46.680 --> 07:48.560
How absolutely rude of her.

07:49.080 --> 07:51.720
What on earth are you doing here?

07:53.400 --> 07:57.880
My housekeeper, outside,
where you can be seen?

07:58.520 --> 08:00.280
You disgrace me!

08:04.080 --> 08:06.760
I made a stupid mistake
choosing to be staff.

08:07.360 --> 08:08.680
It's all work.

08:08.680 --> 08:11.000
- Cooking, cleaning, mopping up...
- [scoffs]

08:11.000 --> 08:14.920
...while you lot are out here
having a right old shindig.

08:15.520 --> 08:16.720
[huffs]

08:16.720 --> 08:18.840
I'll have you sacked, woman.

08:18.840 --> 08:20.800
You will not sour my evening.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.240
People look to me as an arbiter of taste.

08:23.240 --> 08:25.840
What? In that dress?

08:25.840 --> 08:27.240
I beg your pardon.

08:27.240 --> 08:29.080
How dare you!

08:29.080 --> 08:31.200
Maybe it will look better on me.

08:31.200 --> 08:33.040
[duchess gasps, whimpers]

08:33.040 --> 08:34.560
[whimpers]

08:34.560 --> 08:37.080
[screaming]

08:37.720 --> 08:39.560
[Barton] Emily, please. I beg of you.

08:39.560 --> 08:41.240
[Emily] But you consume me, sir.

08:41.960 --> 08:45.920
I think about you my every waking hour,
and I hate myself for it.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.400
And what would you have me do?

08:48.040 --> 08:52.080
I rely on the favour of my aunt,
and she would never approve of this match.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.160
I would be destitute!

08:53.160 --> 08:55.760
But you'd have me to love.

08:56.480 --> 08:57.560
[scoffs]

08:59.440 --> 09:00.880
- I will not marry you.
- [gasps]

09:01.560 --> 09:03.760
Not now. Not ever.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.640
- [scoffs]
- [Emily] Then go.

09:05.640 --> 09:08.400
You stole my heart,
now leave me my reputation.

09:11.400 --> 09:12.400
And yet...

09:15.760 --> 09:17.280
you tempt me still.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.200
[stammers, grunts]

09:24.200 --> 09:25.600
Shh.

09:26.400 --> 09:29.080
Um, I should not be here.
Uh, good evening. [clears throat]

09:33.760 --> 09:37.400
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to, uh-- interrupt.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.520
Are you okay?

09:39.520 --> 09:40.800
I'm ruined.

09:40.800 --> 09:43.280
Oh, what-what-what do you mean ruined?

09:43.280 --> 09:45.480
A couple caught alone is a scandal!

09:46.000 --> 09:47.800
If the man refuses to marry the lady,

09:47.800 --> 09:50.400
she will no longer be acceptable
to polite society.

09:52.400 --> 09:54.120
Oh, this is so <i>Bridgerton</i>. [sighs]

09:55.240 --> 09:57.280
I love these old skies,

09:58.200 --> 10:01.600
ripe with constellations
being found and named.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.960
The Bear. The Ram.

10:03.960 --> 10:06.360
All chosen by the astronomer de Lacaille.

10:06.360 --> 10:08.320
Great with stars, bad with names.

10:08.320 --> 10:09.960
Called one star system Norma.

10:09.960 --> 10:11.560
Do you never stop chattering?

10:13.880 --> 10:14.960
Okay, Rogue.

10:14.960 --> 10:18.720
You're tall, you're handsome,
you're arrogant.

10:19.680 --> 10:21.400
You look great in that jacket.

10:22.840 --> 10:24.960
So there's one thing I have to ask...

10:27.040 --> 10:28.440
Is that a shoe?

10:33.400 --> 10:36.760
No one walks away from a situation
with one less shoe. You'd notice.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.200
I suggest look for the other shoe.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.040
[Doctor] Over there.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.160
A shoe and a leg. Oh, no.

10:44.200 --> 10:47.160
Oh, man. Oh, m--

10:47.160 --> 10:48.240
This is the duchess.

10:48.240 --> 10:49.840
This is the duchess's clothes.

10:49.840 --> 10:51.160
[the sonic whirs]

10:51.160 --> 10:53.440
- I'm sorry.
- [sighs]

10:53.440 --> 10:55.520
This is no way to die.

11:00.960 --> 11:02.400
And you knew.

11:06.280 --> 11:07.280
You didn't even flinch.

11:08.400 --> 11:09.400
Because it's obvious.

11:10.560 --> 11:13.280
This is a murder far beyond
the technology of planet Earth.

11:13.800 --> 11:15.320
It could only be done
by someone brilliant.

11:15.320 --> 11:16.600
- And monstrous.
- And ruthless.

11:16.600 --> 11:18.280
- Contemptible.
- [both] You.

11:18.880 --> 11:19.840
[both] You.

11:19.840 --> 11:21.000
[both] No, you.

11:21.720 --> 11:23.400
Excuse me, I think--

11:24.320 --> 11:25.320
You.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.280
If you ask me, he's an idiot.

11:30.280 --> 11:33.360
Honestly, my mate Bex,
she'd tie him to a lamp post in his pants.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.800
- [chuckling] The funny things you say.
- [chuckles]

11:35.800 --> 11:38.080
But his station in life is too tenuous.

11:38.080 --> 11:40.760
He must find a good match,
and I have no dowry to speak of.

11:40.760 --> 11:42.280
Oh, pfft. You know what?

11:42.280 --> 11:45.120
He sounds like he's choosing
his cushy lifestyle over love.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.000
Cushy?

11:47.520 --> 11:52.160
[stammers] Comfortable, like a cushion.

11:53.240 --> 11:54.280
Cushy.

11:54.280 --> 11:55.600
I like it.

11:55.600 --> 11:58.800
Yeah, okay. Uh, maybe don't use it a lot.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.600
Yeah, okay.

12:01.600 --> 12:03.160
Okay.

12:03.960 --> 12:05.600
- Okay. [chuckles]
- Ah. [chuckles]

12:05.600 --> 12:07.120
- Your words amuse me.
- [chuckles]

12:07.120 --> 12:08.960
It's such a pleasure to meet you, Miss...

12:08.960 --> 12:10.320
Oh, Ruby.

12:10.320 --> 12:12.120
And I'm Miss Emily Beckett.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.440
But most people here would delight
in the gossip, not offer me comfort.

12:15.440 --> 12:16.760
Well, nah. You know what my mum says?

12:16.760 --> 12:19.040
"If it's not your life,
why are you telling it?" [clicks tongue]

12:19.040 --> 12:20.640
She's annoyingly smart.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.640
Right. [sighs]
You know how I forget about a man?

12:25.120 --> 12:26.880
I go dancing.

12:28.160 --> 12:31.120
You know this is not a good look
for you in any century.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.360
Keep moving.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.440
So who do you think I am?

12:34.440 --> 12:35.560
I know you're a Chuldur.

12:37.360 --> 12:38.720
The shapeshifters.

12:39.240 --> 12:40.240
[chuckles]

12:40.240 --> 12:42.160
I mean, I've heard of them.
I've never met one.

12:42.160 --> 12:43.280
Unless I have.

12:43.280 --> 12:44.480
Drop the act, Doc.

12:44.480 --> 12:47.560
There's a Chuldur at work on this planet,
and I've been paid good money to find you.

12:47.560 --> 12:49.440
Okay, firstly, "Doc"?

12:49.440 --> 12:51.040
No, thank you, sir. Please.

12:51.040 --> 12:54.520
Secondly, you are a bounty hunter?

12:54.520 --> 12:57.360
That is so cool.

12:58.280 --> 13:00.600
Catching monsters, getting into scrapes.

13:01.160 --> 13:03.000
Meeting handsome strangers.

13:03.000 --> 13:05.240
I'm here for the money. Nothing more.

13:05.240 --> 13:06.840
So where are you taking me?

13:06.840 --> 13:08.600
- My ship.
- [laughs]

13:08.600 --> 13:10.960
Where'd you hide a spaceship in 1813?

13:10.960 --> 13:12.800
[Rogue] It's cloaked past that shed.

13:12.800 --> 13:15.520
Shed? That's my ship.

13:15.520 --> 13:16.840
You travel in a shed?

13:16.840 --> 13:17.920
Love the shed.

13:17.920 --> 13:20.400
- Why isn't it cloaked?
- It's behind a tree.

13:20.920 --> 13:22.280
[tool whirs]

13:29.840 --> 13:31.360
Now that's a ship.

13:33.200 --> 13:35.760
[chamber music playing]

13:51.160 --> 13:53.680
A wonderful party, Your Grace.

13:53.680 --> 13:54.960
Thank you.

13:56.600 --> 13:57.600
Nice costume.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.120
[feathers ruffle, chirps]

13:59.120 --> 14:00.320
Tight fit.

14:01.480 --> 14:03.240
Oh, you're the duchess?

14:03.240 --> 14:05.360
[sniffs]

14:05.360 --> 14:07.960
Of course. I should've scented you.

14:09.280 --> 14:10.680
I wanted to be her next.

14:10.680 --> 14:11.800
Too slow, love.

14:12.400 --> 14:16.040
[inhales sharply] Although,
I was hoping someone here would be royal.

14:18.000 --> 14:22.680
Nevertheless, I have picked my outfit
for the wedding.

14:22.680 --> 14:24.400
Oh, really? Who?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.600
[duchess] Lady Ruby Sunday.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.120
She just seems so... different.

14:32.120 --> 14:33.200
[sighs]

14:44.880 --> 14:49.920
So, this place is a mess.

14:49.920 --> 14:51.000
[chuckles]

14:51.000 --> 14:53.840
- Rogue, honey, you need company.
- I live alone.

14:53.840 --> 14:55.720
[chuckling] Baby, I can see.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.040
But was that always the case?

14:59.840 --> 15:00.840
Why do you ask?

15:00.840 --> 15:03.320
This is an old asteroid hopper

15:03.320 --> 15:04.640
piloted by two.

15:04.640 --> 15:06.200
Not anymore. Stand there.

15:07.760 --> 15:09.120
What do those things do?

15:09.120 --> 15:10.240
It's a trap.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.440
Tri-form on.

15:11.440 --> 15:13.400
[automated voice] <i>Tri-form activated.</i>

15:13.400 --> 15:14.800
[Doctor stammers]

15:15.640 --> 15:16.640
Oh, I see.

15:16.640 --> 15:17.800
My name is bond.

15:17.800 --> 15:19.040
Molecular bond.

15:19.040 --> 15:21.920
It works as a transport gate.
It just needs time to charge up.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.080
[Doctor] Transport to where?

15:23.080 --> 15:24.920
- The incinerator.
- [controls beeping]

15:24.920 --> 15:26.000
It's a death sentence.

15:26.760 --> 15:27.800
You're a killer.

15:27.800 --> 15:29.120
Oh, well.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.640
- How about tri-form off?
- [the sonic beeps]

15:31.640 --> 15:33.800
[tri-form buzzes, hums]

15:33.800 --> 15:36.000
- Tri-form off.
- It's deadlocked.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.120
You can't turn it off until it's charged,
and once it's charged...

15:40.680 --> 15:41.680
[tool whirs]

15:42.400 --> 15:43.880
- ...I press send.
- Yeah?

15:43.880 --> 15:47.520
Well, my gadget can do more things
than your gadget.

15:47.520 --> 15:48.800
[Rogue] You're not scaring me.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.640
The ship would've registered that
as a dangerous device.

15:51.640 --> 15:53.760
Instead, it says...

15:53.760 --> 15:54.880
[gasps]

15:55.800 --> 15:57.280
- ...screwdriver.
- Yes.

15:57.280 --> 16:00.200
Which is convenient because I've been
wanting some new shelves over there.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.120
[Doctor] Oh, ha-ha. No.

16:02.120 --> 16:04.120
But it does do all sorts of things.

16:05.640 --> 16:07.600
[the sonic whirs]

16:10.400 --> 16:12.520
Ah.

16:12.520 --> 16:14.000
[the sonic stops whirring, clicks]

16:14.000 --> 16:15.920
Did you get your name
from Dungeons and Dragons?

16:17.440 --> 16:18.560
Roll for Insight.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.000
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.880
[Scottish accent] Was that a wee smile
from the most serious man in history?

16:24.880 --> 16:27.680
- And it says that you're wired for sound.
- [the sonic beeps]

16:27.680 --> 16:31.160
["Can't Get You Out of My Head" playing]

16:31.800 --> 16:33.720
[normal voice] Now, this is a surprise.

16:33.720 --> 16:35.480
Oh, I love this.

16:35.480 --> 16:37.880
Classic!

[music ends]

17:23.480 --> 17:25.720
Have your fun, Doctor.
You've got very little time left.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.040
Ro-- [chuckles]

17:28.880 --> 17:31.560
Rogue, I am telling you,
you have got the wrong man, okay?

17:31.560 --> 17:32.840
And I can prove it.

17:32.840 --> 17:36.680
This authenticates me as non-Chuldur.

17:42.600 --> 17:44.280
- It says, "You're hot."
- Does it?

17:44.280 --> 17:45.440
I'm sorry-- No. It's broken.

17:45.440 --> 17:47.320
- Is it you're hot or I'm hot?
- I-- No.

17:47.320 --> 17:49.200
- It is just that it's--
- Who's hot, Doctor?

17:49.200 --> 17:51.160
It means the temperature.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.680
Ah. It suits you. Flustered.
It's a good look.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.840
- You should try it more often.
- Says the man about to kill me.

17:55.840 --> 17:58.720
Gotta do my job,
but just for the paperwork...

18:00.920 --> 18:03.400

If you kill me, you leave a Chuldur

Now, let me go, bounty hunter.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.240

Wow.

- [both giggling]
- [Emily] We can't keep hiding.

19:23.040 --> 19:25.440
Oh, we can. They all wanna find you
a husband downstairs,

19:25.440 --> 19:27.120

Come on,
what do you wanna do with your life?

19:34.640 --> 19:37.800
Well, I'll marry
someone lesser and smaller.

19:37.800 --> 19:40.720
There may not be love,
but perhaps a kindly smile at dinner

19:41.240 --> 19:42.520
and then a shared grave.

Aw. Right.

Oh, so much more, Emily.
Oh, let me tell you.

You are welcome.

Why? What does it do now?

21:27.560 --> 21:30.880
Well, whatever the Chuldur has done,
I can't let you kill it.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.800
I also can't let it kill others.

21:33.800 --> 21:38.360
So, instead, we will transport it
to a random, barren dimension.

I lost them.

24:05.160 --> 24:08.120
Ruby, 2024. Rogue,
outer-space bounty hunter. Nice lady?

24:08.120 --> 24:09.560
- Emily.
- Emily, 1813.

24:09.560 --> 24:12.520
The duchess,
a shapeshifting Chuldur. Okay?

24:12.520 --> 24:13.880
I know the word, "Okay".

24:13.880 --> 24:15.520
- [music ends]
- [applause]

24:15.520 --> 24:18.080
Okay, but what does anyone get
out of killing these people?

24:18.080 --> 24:20.480
I mean, I know they're posh snobs
and all that,

24:20.480 --> 24:24.200
but we found the housekeeper dead.
I mean, why would anybody do that?

24:24.200 --> 24:26.480
[chamber music playing]

24:26.480 --> 24:29.000
The dance. The drama.

24:30.240 --> 24:33.400
The emotion. Oh, man. It's cosplay.

24:34.200 --> 24:36.400
- All of this. The Chuldur is cosplaying.
- [gasps]

24:36.400 --> 24:39.120
You said a Chuldur comes to a planet
and tries on people like outfits,

24:39.120 --> 24:41.480
all for the fun of it.
Exactly like cosplay.

24:41.480 --> 24:45.200
Wait, so you mean it's literally
dressing up and playing at <i>Bridgerton</i>?

24:45.200 --> 24:48.200
Could be. I mean, those TV signals
beam out across the stars.

24:48.200 --> 24:49.920
What are these TV signals?

24:49.920 --> 24:51.080
N-No time.

24:51.080 --> 24:54.240
Uh, we need to get the duchess
outside on her own.

24:54.240 --> 24:56.800
And if there's one thing
that attracts her, it's scandal.

24:57.640 --> 25:00.440
And outrage. And plot twists.

25:04.160 --> 25:05.640
So, come on, Rogue.

25:06.600 --> 25:07.720
Shall we?

25:08.800 --> 25:10.720
I don't see how us dancing
will create a scene.

25:10.720 --> 25:16.120
Then you should have researched this era
a little more because we are scandalous.

25:17.120 --> 25:20.000
[Rogue] So, what is this ancient
Earth tradition of cosplay?

25:20.000 --> 25:22.040
[Doctor chuckles] Oh, Rogue.

25:22.040 --> 25:24.880
It's when fans dress up as characters
that they like,

25:24.880 --> 25:28.240
and in our Chuldur's case,
it's <i>Bridgerton</i>.

25:29.200 --> 25:30.200
Who is that?

25:38.920 --> 25:40.320
[guests gasp]

25:40.320 --> 25:41.440
Quite the sight.

25:51.280 --> 25:54.680
Oh, my, ladies. This is shocking.

26:38.520 --> 26:41.760
We need to have a big fight so we
can storm out and draw her to us.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.720
The Chuldur cosplay. Not me.

26:45.400 --> 26:50.000
This is the wrong time to be strong
and silent and so attractive.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.600
- How dare you, my lord?
- [guests gasp]

26:51.600 --> 26:53.080
[music stops]

26:54.760 --> 26:56.080
Oh, this is new.

26:56.080 --> 27:01.200
You would ask me to give up my title,
my fortune,

27:02.400 --> 27:04.480
but what future can you promise me?

27:07.280 --> 27:08.320
[stammers]

27:08.920 --> 27:10.640
- You cad!
- [guests gasp]

27:10.640 --> 27:17.120
Tell me what your heart wants,
or I shall turn my back on you forever.

27:17.120 --> 27:19.520
[stammers] I--

27:20.680 --> 27:22.440
[whispers] Say anything.

27:27.320 --> 27:29.280
[guests gasp, murmur]

27:45.760 --> 27:46.760
Sorry, I ca--

27:49.200 --> 27:50.400
I can't.

27:59.760 --> 28:00.760
[gasps]

28:03.840 --> 28:06.800
- Oh, I must play them. [inhales sharply]
- Intercept.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.480
- You go that way.
- [bones click]

28:11.560 --> 28:12.880
[bones click]

28:13.880 --> 28:15.080
[Chuldur shrieks]

28:15.080 --> 28:16.200
[gasps]

28:16.200 --> 28:17.640
[screeches]

28:18.280 --> 28:19.960
What? By the Lord.

28:20.720 --> 28:22.760
Oh, it's him. It's not the duchess.

28:22.760 --> 28:23.840
- [gasps]
- What is he?

28:24.360 --> 28:26.160
How can you even talk like this?
Who are you?

28:26.160 --> 28:27.480
- [whimpers]
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:28.720 --> 28:30.000
Now keep the duchess talking.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.000
A Chuldur is strong, and if she starts
to change you, it won't stop.

28:34.480 --> 28:36.760
Quick question.
How many does this trap hold?

28:36.760 --> 28:38.200
One.

28:38.200 --> 28:40.280
Because there's only one Chuldur, yeah?

28:47.440 --> 28:48.920
[bones clicking]

28:50.760 --> 28:52.000
- It's a Chuldur family.
- Uh-huh.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.640
I want to be the Doctor.

28:53.640 --> 28:56.600
- Who wants to fight for the other one?
- Run.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.640
- I'm normally the one that says that.
- [Chuldur] Me. Me. Me.

28:58.640 --> 29:01.160
[Chuldur screeching]

29:05.000 --> 29:06.040
[screeches]

29:06.600 --> 29:09.720
[Chuldur] I found them! [warbles]

29:09.720 --> 29:14.320
- Gentlemen, we just want some fun!
- [Chuldur screeching]

29:14.320 --> 29:16.880
[duchess] I would love to be the Doctor.

29:20.840 --> 29:21.840
[Chuldur screeches]

29:21.840 --> 29:26.560
Breaking spines. Removing tonsils.

29:26.560 --> 29:28.800
Live vivisection!

29:28.800 --> 29:30.840
[Chuldur screeching]

29:34.120 --> 29:35.480
Now find them!

29:36.160 --> 29:39.240
[sighs] I want a new look.

29:40.040 --> 29:41.040
[sighs]

29:42.960 --> 29:45.600
[Chuldur screeches]

29:51.200 --> 29:52.200
[squawks]

29:55.680 --> 29:56.680
[squawks]

29:59.880 --> 30:00.880
[Chuldur squawks]

30:02.760 --> 30:03.760
[warbles]

30:07.360 --> 30:08.360
[warbles]

30:12.480 --> 30:13.600
[screeches]

30:14.840 --> 30:16.280
Where are they?

30:16.280 --> 30:18.600
- Any luck?
- The stables are empty.

30:19.520 --> 30:20.960
Back to the house.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.360
We must advance with the wedding.

30:25.800 --> 30:27.920
That should get them out of hiding.

30:30.320 --> 30:31.720
She said wedding?

30:31.720 --> 30:33.120
But four of them.

30:33.120 --> 30:35.480
We've only got a trap for one.
What do we do?

30:37.120 --> 30:39.960
[duchess] When we start the action,
these human beings will panic and scream.

30:39.960 --> 30:42.000
It'll ruin the authenticity
of the evening.

30:42.000 --> 30:44.400
Oh, but I like the panic
and the screaming bit.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.680
This is what we came for.

30:46.680 --> 30:50.280
The gossip, the romance, the scandal.

30:50.280 --> 30:54.520
We still have the big finale wedding
to come, and then London.

30:55.040 --> 30:58.240
We can play our games
on a magnificent scale.

30:58.240 --> 31:02.400
Parliament first. Then royalty.
I can be king.

31:02.400 --> 31:06.440
And we can start wars with the French
and the Spanish and the Portuguese,

31:06.440 --> 31:08.520
and everyone who doesn't look British.

31:08.520 --> 31:09.600
And bloodshed.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.360
- And cannons.
- Gunpowder.

31:11.360 --> 31:14.560
We're gonna cosplay this planet to death.

31:17.480 --> 31:19.520
- Thank you.
- [the sonic whirs]

31:19.520 --> 31:22.200
- A little bit of zizz.
- Zizz?

31:22.920 --> 31:26.440
Technical term.
I can make this transport gate carry four.

31:26.440 --> 31:27.800
There might be others.

31:29.080 --> 31:32.280
- Right. Uh, six. Six maximum.
- [the sonic whirs]

31:33.240 --> 31:36.360
The problem is too much weight.
This can now only work once.

31:36.360 --> 31:38.440
We've got one try at this, Rogue.
Just one.

31:39.640 --> 31:41.480
We've gotta get it right first time.

31:46.760 --> 31:48.480
Oh, Emily.

31:48.480 --> 31:51.760
Emily, I'm sorry.
I know it's hard, but trust me.

31:51.760 --> 31:54.680
There are scary things in the universe,
but the good things always outnumber 'em.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.520
How can you say these things?

31:56.520 --> 31:59.680
You with your TV and your okay.

32:00.640 --> 32:03.360
Uh, okay, look, the truth is--

32:04.440 --> 32:05.920
Nah, you've seen enough.

32:05.920 --> 32:07.760
I'm not from your world.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.640
I come from the future.

32:15.320 --> 32:17.880
You are truly remarkable.

32:17.880 --> 32:18.960
[chuckles]

32:19.480 --> 32:21.080
And I thought I was interesting.

32:22.000 --> 32:26.120
A bookish little wallflower,
risking it all for a secret love.

32:27.400 --> 32:28.840
- But you?
- [fan thuds]

32:29.360 --> 32:31.320
You are wild

32:31.320 --> 32:34.080
- and brave and rude.
- [sighs]

32:34.080 --> 32:36.720
Living a life of adventure
from times yet to come.

32:38.240 --> 32:39.440
Oh, Ruby Sunday...

32:39.440 --> 32:40.640
- [bones click]
- [gasps]

32:42.760 --> 32:45.440
I want to be you.

32:46.320 --> 32:49.000
- [zapping]
- [Ruby screams]

32:49.000 --> 32:50.920
["Eine kleine Nachtmusik"
playing on strings]

33:02.160 --> 33:03.480
[speaking French]

33:03.480 --> 33:05.280
[guests screaming, clamouring]

33:05.280 --> 33:09.680
[speaking French, German]

33:09.680 --> 33:10.960
[speaking French]

33:11.760 --> 33:13.800
- [squawks]
- [guests gasp, shriek]

33:14.360 --> 33:18.400
[sighs] Oh, come now, loves, a party
isn't a party without a costume change.

33:19.200 --> 33:21.680
And don't I look fabulous?

33:21.680 --> 33:22.840
[squawks]

33:23.360 --> 33:25.560
[guests screaming]

33:25.560 --> 33:27.560
[duchess] Silence!

33:27.560 --> 33:29.800
- Any sign of Ruby?
- Not seen her.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.200
They've locked the doors.

33:32.520 --> 33:33.520
This is the endgame.

33:33.520 --> 33:35.200
- Chuldur leave no witnesses.
- [duchess] Darlings...

33:35.200 --> 33:42.280
- [Rogue] They'll slaughter everyone.
- ...now it is time for the season finale.

33:42.280 --> 33:48.920
And what could be better than a wedding?

33:49.560 --> 33:51.920
[gasps] And here they come.

33:51.920 --> 33:54.080
Bride and groom. [moans]

33:55.360 --> 33:56.360
[giggles]

33:57.040 --> 33:59.520
How does it feel to be Lady Ruby?

33:59.520 --> 34:01.120
[Ruby] Mmm. Delicious.

34:01.120 --> 34:03.720
- [whispers] I'm sorry.
- [whispers] They got her.

34:04.360 --> 34:06.200
[duchess] She looks good on you.

34:06.200 --> 34:07.280
[bones click]

34:08.960 --> 34:10.000
[warbles]

34:19.120 --> 34:20.200
[Carla] <i>Doctor.</i>

34:23.520 --> 34:24.920
<i>Doctor, look.</i>

34:26.000 --> 34:30.160
You know I can't stop her,
and I wouldn't wanna do that.

34:31.400 --> 34:36.520
And if anyone deserves to see it all,
feel it all, it's Ruby.

34:36.520 --> 34:37.600
[chuckles]

34:38.520 --> 34:40.120
[Carla] But I'm still her mum.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.200
I need to know she'll be okay.

34:44.320 --> 34:45.560
You'll keep her safe?

34:46.160 --> 34:47.520
I will keep her safe.

34:51.120 --> 34:52.120
<i>I promise.</i>

34:52.120 --> 34:53.200
[sobs]

34:55.840 --> 34:57.880
[clattering]

34:57.880 --> 34:59.400
[distant screaming]

35:00.000 --> 35:04.560
Now, every wedding needs a vicar.

35:07.680 --> 35:08.840
You.

35:09.920 --> 35:11.240
Step forward, sir.

35:14.440 --> 35:17.320
- Madam. Your Grace. Your "birdiness".
- [warbles]

35:17.320 --> 35:18.400
Hmm?

35:18.400 --> 35:23.760
I cannot sanction wedlock
for creatures from hell.

35:23.760 --> 35:24.840
[warbles]

35:27.040 --> 35:28.280
[guests gasp, clamouring]

35:29.520 --> 35:31.160
- [guests screaming]
- [vicar pants]

35:37.720 --> 35:39.760
[shrieks]

35:40.960 --> 35:41.960
[groans]

35:42.480 --> 35:44.920
How long do they live for? [sniffles]

35:44.920 --> 35:46.680
- Chuldur?
- Mmm.

35:46.680 --> 35:49.000
They have a lifespan of 600 years.

35:52.080 --> 35:54.720
Good. Good.

35:56.440 --> 35:57.920
It's a long time to suffer.

36:05.080 --> 36:10.800
Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today
in the sight of the unholy--

36:10.800 --> 36:14.440
[scoffs] Oh, whatever.
Et cetera, praise be, holibobs--

36:14.440 --> 36:18.880
to witness the marriage
of Lord Barton to Miss Ruby.

36:18.880 --> 36:21.160
- I object!
- [guests gasping]

36:23.040 --> 36:24.800
Sorry, had we reached that bit yet?

36:24.800 --> 36:26.360
It's very hard to hear out here.

36:26.360 --> 36:31.120
I object to this wedding

36:31.680 --> 36:33.440
and to all that you are, Chuldur.

36:33.440 --> 36:36.680
[sniffs] Taste his inhuman scent.

36:36.680 --> 36:41.080
Mmm. Breathe it in deep, baby,
because I am exuding,

36:41.080 --> 36:43.280
and I am one of a kind.

36:43.280 --> 36:45.720
He is quite unique.

36:45.720 --> 36:48.320
[Chuldur] He's something unknown.
I want to be him!

36:49.240 --> 36:50.920
I want it! I want it!

36:50.920 --> 36:55.360
And I want you standing
exactly there for this.

36:55.360 --> 36:56.640
[Chuldur laugh]

36:56.640 --> 36:58.720
One-third of a transport gate?

36:58.720 --> 37:00.360
[Chuldur] One-third of a trap.

37:00.360 --> 37:02.280
One-third of a brain, Doctor.

37:02.280 --> 37:03.760
Of course.

37:03.760 --> 37:05.920
I need the other two pieces.
I wonder where they are.

37:05.920 --> 37:07.840
[inhales deeply] Oh.

37:08.800 --> 37:10.000
[buzzes]

37:10.000 --> 37:14.200
For the desecration of Ruby Sunday,
you deserve only this.

37:15.360 --> 37:16.800
- Tri-form on!
- [Chuldur clamour]

37:16.800 --> 37:18.840
[automated voice] <i>Trap locked at five.</i>

37:18.840 --> 37:20.280
How dare you, sir?

37:20.280 --> 37:22.200
[guests screaming]

37:22.200 --> 37:23.240
[tri-form hums]

37:24.560 --> 37:26.040
You'll pay for this.

37:26.040 --> 37:27.120
But when?

37:27.120 --> 37:32.280
Because five passengers in a transport
gate gives about... [groans] ...uh, 80 vexils.

37:32.280 --> 37:35.360
- So-- [chuckles]
- Doctor, how long's a vexil?

37:35.360 --> 37:36.640
Don't pretend.

37:36.640 --> 37:38.160
No, I'm not. It's me, Doctor.

37:38.760 --> 37:39.760
Nice try.

37:40.840 --> 37:43.240
[grunts] Me mum's called Carla,
and me gran's called Cherry,

37:43.240 --> 37:44.440
and it snowed when I was born,

37:44.440 --> 37:46.800
and we met space babies,
and I'm really, really sorry.

37:51.960 --> 37:53.400
But how?

37:54.040 --> 37:55.560
I cosplayed. [chuckles]

37:55.560 --> 37:57.480
["Poker Face" playing on strings]

37:58.520 --> 37:59.600
Battle mode.

38:02.360 --> 38:03.480
[grunting]

38:05.920 --> 38:08.280
- [grunts]
- [Ruby] Whoa! [chuckles]

38:08.880 --> 38:09.880
[screams]

38:11.680 --> 38:12.680
[bones click]

38:14.320 --> 38:16.080
[Emily screams]

38:17.000 --> 38:18.840
Doctor, I can't move. [sobs]

38:20.800 --> 38:22.520
That's what she did to me!

38:24.280 --> 38:26.760
How could you mistake her for me?

38:26.760 --> 38:28.840
[Barton] She has the scent of a Chuldur.

38:28.840 --> 38:33.320
You idiot! It's a false scent
from that cheap psychic jewellery.

38:33.320 --> 38:36.680
[pants] Tri-form-- Tri-form off.

38:36.680 --> 38:39.800
Tri-form off! Tri-form off! Tri-form off!

38:39.800 --> 38:41.480
[automated voice] <i>Transport gate charged.</i>

38:41.480 --> 38:42.760
- [tri-form humming]
- <i>Press send.</i>

38:42.760 --> 38:44.280
[duchess] You won't press send.

38:44.280 --> 38:48.240
You're too soft and feeble
to dispatch your little blonde friend.

38:48.240 --> 38:50.280
Emily, you have my full permission.

38:50.880 --> 38:52.560
Become the Doctor.

38:52.560 --> 38:53.720
[squawks]

38:54.640 --> 38:56.440
[gasps] Um.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.280
[both grunt]

38:58.280 --> 39:00.120
- [grunts]
- [Emily squawking]

39:00.120 --> 39:02.280
[automated voice] <i>Trap locked at six.</i>

39:02.280 --> 39:03.320
[Rogue] Doctor, press send.

39:03.320 --> 39:05.400
- We've only got one chance.
- I can't.

39:05.400 --> 39:06.960
He's too much of a coward.

39:06.960 --> 39:08.240
Press the button.

39:08.240 --> 39:10.600
- It will send Ruby.
- No, Doctor. It's fine--

39:10.600 --> 39:12.840
No! No, no! No!

39:12.840 --> 39:17.080
If you don't send, the Chuldur
will escape, and Ruby dies anyway.

39:17.840 --> 39:20.240
[automated voice] <i>Transport gate charged.</i>

39:20.240 --> 39:21.400
It's fine.

39:21.400 --> 39:22.760
[automated voice] <i>Press send.</i>

39:23.480 --> 39:24.800
[Rogue] They'll kill us.

39:24.800 --> 39:28.440
Then this house. Then London.
Then the world.

39:28.440 --> 39:29.600
You know that.

39:30.800 --> 39:32.080
You absolutely know it.

39:35.080 --> 39:36.160
So can you do it?

39:37.720 --> 39:39.040
[sobs]

39:40.000 --> 39:42.520
Can you lose your friend
to save the world?

39:43.080 --> 39:45.800
[sobbing]

39:49.760 --> 39:51.200
[sniffles]

39:52.960 --> 39:53.960
No.

39:59.880 --> 40:00.880
I know.

40:11.560 --> 40:13.480
[sobs, sighs]

40:21.320 --> 40:22.560
- [Ruby] Rogue, no!
- [grunts]

40:22.560 --> 40:23.920
[automated voice] <i>Matter exchange.</i>

40:23.920 --> 40:26.120
<i>Trap locked at six.</i>

40:27.480 --> 40:28.480
[gasps]

40:29.880 --> 40:30.880
Find me.

40:31.480 --> 40:33.520
- [tri-form whirs]
- [duchess yelps]

40:34.160 --> 40:36.320
[gasps]

40:54.400 --> 40:56.040
- You okay?
- Mmm.

41:02.080 --> 41:03.760
[sniffles, sighs]

41:19.720 --> 41:21.240
[the sonic beeps, hums]

41:21.240 --> 41:23.560
[spaceship whirring]

41:33.120 --> 41:35.680
Just sending the ship into orbit
around the moon,

41:36.760 --> 41:40.680
- so it can wait, as long as it takes.
- [the sonic beeping]

41:43.400 --> 41:45.840
Can't we use the TARDIS and go find him?

41:46.520 --> 41:48.120
- [chuckles]
- [the sonic beeps]

41:49.160 --> 41:52.400
There are as many dimensions
as there are atoms in the universe.

41:52.920 --> 41:54.120
[inhales deeply]

41:55.360 --> 41:58.240
Don't even know his real name. [chuckles]

42:01.400 --> 42:02.520
I'm sorry.

42:02.520 --> 42:03.600
[inhales deeply]

42:04.360 --> 42:09.200
Anyway, it is what it is. So, onwards.

42:09.200 --> 42:11.800
Fine. Next. Off we go.

42:12.400 --> 42:15.640
- Where shall we go? Anywhere.
- Doctor, you don't have to be like this.

42:15.640 --> 42:18.160
I have to be like this
'cause this is what I'm like.

42:18.160 --> 42:21.400
Onwards. Upwards. New horizons.

42:21.400 --> 42:23.840
- Moving on. It's fine--
- Okay, can you just shut up a second?

42:26.320 --> 42:27.360
[chuckles]

42:33.200 --> 42:35.680
[breathes deeply]

42:42.600 --> 42:44.440
It's good to have you back, Ruby.

42:48.360 --> 42:49.640
And you, Doctor.

42:50.880 --> 42:51.880
[giggles]

42:51.880 --> 42:54.400
[both humming]

43:48.120 --> 43:51.040
[theme song playing]

43:51.880 --> 43:54.440
[Doctor] <i>Everywhere I land,
a woman appears.</i>

43:54.440 --> 43:56.760
In every dream, I'm there.

43:56.760 --> 43:58.880
[Doctor] <i>She doesn't know why,
but she remembered them.</i>

43:58.880 --> 44:00.840
Doctor. There's something wrong.

44:00.840 --> 44:04.800
Whatever it is, here it comes.

44:04.800 --> 44:06.880
[song continues]
