WEBVTT

03:43.874 --> 03:46.752
Andale caballo.

04:05.312 --> 04:07.647
Señor.

04:09.316 --> 04:11.234
Señor.

04:12.277 --> 04:13.737
Señor.

04:13.837 --> 04:15.046
Tighten up that girth.

04:15.213 --> 04:18.466
Señor, I must... I must
go to San Felipe.

04:18.634 --> 04:20.216
My mother is dead!

04:21.011 --> 04:23.638
Straight down the road about 50 miles.

04:32.022 --> 04:33.230
Please.

04:38.195 --> 04:39.820
Get out of here.

04:52.876 --> 04:55.461
Hey. Hey, amigo.

04:58.590 --> 04:59.882
Come here.

05:23.240 --> 05:26.575
Oh, perfect.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.579
You're perfect.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.335
I swear to God, boys, he's just right.

05:37.129 --> 05:39.922
I'm gonna put you in that stage

05:40.465 --> 05:44.260
and watch those faces
when they see you come in!

06:10.620 --> 06:11.954
Move.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.385
- By God, I...
- Never mind, dear.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.049
Over there.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.733
Not that door, the other one.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.068
There.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.571
Pull. Go on.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.828
There you are.

08:15.996 --> 08:19.415
Now you just sit down and be quiet,
like a good little boy.

08:21.585 --> 08:24.879
You see? He does understand.

08:25.046 --> 08:26.213
Who knows?

08:26.381 --> 08:27.882
Perhaps he can even talk.

08:28.049 --> 08:30.718
Oh, now, even the peasants...

08:30.886 --> 08:32.803
A bit of mustard?

08:32.971 --> 08:36.724
Thank you. Even the peasants
are entitled to their rights.

08:36.892 --> 08:39.684
After all, they have won a revolution.

08:40.312 --> 08:42.104
Or at least, almost.

08:42.272 --> 08:45.191
Animals, that's what they are. Animals.

08:45.901 --> 08:46.817
Pardon.

08:46.985 --> 08:50.237
Let us not forget even animals
can be tame and harmless.

08:50.405 --> 08:53.157
Personally, I consider them
unfortunate brutes.

08:53.325 --> 08:55.367
Yes, brutes. Quite right.

08:55.535 --> 08:57.578
Precisely, my dear lady,
precisely.

08:57.746 --> 09:02.249
I hate saying it, but you should
hear them in the confessional.

09:02.417 --> 09:04.251
You would never imagine.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.962
- Did you know that they...
- I can imagine, Father.

09:07.130 --> 09:10.883
I can imagine living
in such promiscuity.

09:11.051 --> 09:14.303
All of them in one room,
male and female together,

09:14.471 --> 09:17.264
lying in a heap like rats in a sewer.

09:17.432 --> 09:19.600
At night, when the lights are out,

09:19.768 --> 09:21.602
all their inhibitions disappear.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.562
You never know who is next.

09:23.730 --> 09:28.609
Mother, sister, daughter, God.

09:28.777 --> 09:31.153
Every country has its own plague.

09:33.156 --> 09:35.783
Just like them niggers we got back home.

09:35.951 --> 09:39.036
Just like animals, you mean,
because that's what they are.

09:39.204 --> 09:42.456
Exactly. Which is why they're half-wits.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.459
Hey, you.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.295
You know who your father was?

09:52.133 --> 09:55.052
You know at least how old you are?

09:57.973 --> 09:59.473
He doesn't know.

10:00.392 --> 10:04.603
You know how many kids you have, eh?

10:05.272 --> 10:08.524
Do you know
how many kids your mother had?

10:09.776 --> 10:11.860
He doesn't know anything, you see?

10:12.028 --> 10:16.448
And it was to benefit scum like this
that the agrarian reform was imposed.

10:17.200 --> 10:20.869
And that ass, Madero,
wanted to give the government

10:21.037 --> 10:25.207
and our land to idiots like this.

10:25.375 --> 10:28.210
We are all pawns
in the hands of almighty God.

10:28.378 --> 10:29.837
Fortunately, divine providence has

10:30.005 --> 10:32.339
disposed of that rash individual,
Madero.

10:32.507 --> 10:35.718
My dear monsignor,
let us be realistic.

10:35.885 --> 10:39.805
What you choose to call providence,
I call General Huerta.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.765
He put the peasants in their place.

10:41.933 --> 10:45.894
Which is the best place for animals
because that's what they are.

10:48.398 --> 10:49.732
Animals.

10:50.608 --> 10:52.609
I can imagine, Father.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.654
I can imagine living
in such promiscuity.

10:55.822 --> 11:00.617
wanted to give the government
and our land to idiots like this.

11:01.411 --> 11:04.038
Every country has its own plague.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.456
Just like them niggers
we got back home.

11:05.623 --> 11:06.749
Brutes.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.792
- Half-wits.
- Animals.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.253
- Idiots.
- Half-wits.

11:11.421 --> 11:12.838
Madero.

11:13.006 --> 11:14.173
Just like them niggers.

11:14.341 --> 11:15.257
Animals.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.426
Because that's what they are.

11:17.594 --> 11:18.761
Animals.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.346
Just like them niggers.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.513
- Brutes.
- That's what they are.

11:21.681 --> 11:22.598
- Idiots.
- Animals.

11:22.766 --> 11:23.640
Half-wits.

11:23.808 --> 11:24.975
- Like them niggers.
- Brutes.

11:25.143 --> 11:26.310
- Animals.
- Idiots.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.270
I consider them
unfortunate brutes.

11:28.438 --> 11:29.855
- I can imagine.
- Niggers.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.190
- Idiots.
- I can imagine.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.608
- Brutes.
- Niggers.

11:32.776 --> 11:33.734
Animals.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.194
- Unfortunate brutes.
- Like them niggers.

11:35.362 --> 11:36.278
- Brutes!
- Idiots.

11:36.446 --> 11:38.030
- Niggers.
- Idiots!

11:38.198 --> 11:39.740
- Like them niggers.
- Idiots.

11:39.908 --> 11:41.075
- Animals.
- Half-wits!

11:41.999 --> 11:44.335
Anda caballo, anda.

11:52.050 --> 11:54.511
Anda caballo.

11:59.094 --> 12:02.012
Hey, you, come on!
Give us a hand and push!

12:02.472 --> 12:05.224
Move, will you?
You lazy bunch of greasers!

12:06.476 --> 12:09.353
You'd think they'd get off their asses
to help us, the bastards?

12:09.521 --> 12:10.813
Hell, no.

12:12.653 --> 12:16.865
Anda...
Caballo huyo.

12:32.338 --> 12:34.424
Haaaahh!

13:47.702 --> 13:50.287
Take him away
before he dirties everything.

13:51.915 --> 13:54.708
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
you will give everything to my niños,

13:54.876 --> 13:57.169
and you will give it to them
without any trouble.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.254
We kill them all, okay, Papá?

14:01.090 --> 14:03.050
How many times have I told you,
Chulo,

14:03.218 --> 14:05.511
no shooting unless
Papá pulls the trigger?

14:17.774 --> 14:20.692
Come. Come, come, come, come!

14:35.291 --> 14:37.501
You wanted to know my family?

14:37.669 --> 14:39.294
That's my sons!

14:39.671 --> 14:42.089
Each one of them
from a different mother, huh?

14:42.257 --> 14:43.924
And now you kneel.

14:44.425 --> 14:46.718
Kneel. Kneel!

14:47.762 --> 14:48.929
Papá!

14:52.976 --> 14:55.352
This is my father, I think.

14:55.520 --> 14:58.981
- Pleased to meet...
- Go inside before Chulo kills everyone.

15:00.108 --> 15:01.692
My mother,
she got the blood of the Aztecs,

15:01.859 --> 15:04.152
which was before your people!

15:09.659 --> 15:11.785
And now, I ask you a question.

15:12.954 --> 15:14.454
Can you make a baby?

15:16.040 --> 15:18.083
Can you make a baby?

15:20.128 --> 15:23.213
That's sad. But we will fix that.

15:26.631 --> 15:28.007
Señora.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.887
Let me go. Let go.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.194
Go.

15:50.450 --> 15:51.658
Go.

16:15.058 --> 16:20.103
Go. Go. Go. Go! Go!

17:25.294 --> 17:27.212
That's pretty good, huh?

18:38.201 --> 18:39.659
Oh, Jesus.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.246
Help me. I'm going to faint.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.249
No, no, no.

18:47.668 --> 18:50.837
You faint now,
and you'll miss the best part.

19:00.181 --> 19:03.141
Wonderful. You got everything.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.979
You'll pay for this, you bastard!

19:08.147 --> 19:10.732
I'm a citizen
of the United States of America!

19:10.900 --> 19:13.568
To me, you are just a naked
son of a bitch.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.487
Understand, Yankee?

19:37.718 --> 19:39.094
Thank you.

20:10.793 --> 20:13.628
Thank you... for everything.

24:07.530 --> 24:09.030
Have you a light?

24:37.351 --> 24:39.227
Duck, you sucker.

24:45.776 --> 24:47.610
There is a hole in the roof!

24:56.078 --> 24:57.162
Hey!

25:16.098 --> 25:18.850
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.143
Why?

25:34.200 --> 25:37.535
You pull that trigger and
shoot me, I fall.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.466
And if I fall,

25:52.885 --> 25:55.011
they'll have to alter all the maps.

26:17.201 --> 26:21.162
You see, when I go,
half this bloody country goes with me

26:22.623 --> 26:24.165
including yourself.

26:37.429 --> 26:42.517
NATIONAL BANK OF MESA VERDE

27:05.374 --> 27:06.716
You understand now?

27:06.909 --> 27:08.929
Ah, sí sí sí sí sí sí.

27:09.169 --> 27:10.028
I understand.

27:10.220 --> 27:12.138
Sí.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.965
It's like a miracle of God!

27:14.133 --> 27:16.467
You, you are a great magician, huh?

27:16.635 --> 27:19.178
I stop your motorcycle,
and you do the magic with my coach.

27:19.346 --> 27:21.297
So, now we are even.

27:21.598 --> 27:22.382
Even?

27:22.550 --> 27:23.550
Sí.

27:25.394 --> 27:27.228
No, we're not even.

27:28.480 --> 27:30.732
You fix my motorcycle, we'll be even.

27:33.402 --> 27:34.986
I'll be inside.

27:40.878 --> 27:42.254
Oh!

27:43.078 --> 27:44.454
We kill him now, Papá?

27:44.621 --> 27:48.082
No. First, we fix the motorcycle. Shh!

28:02.431 --> 28:03.765
It's whiskey.

28:04.767 --> 28:06.392
Thank God for that, huh?

28:06.560 --> 28:09.020
Where you going in this contraption?

28:10.189 --> 28:11.397
Well...

28:11.565 --> 28:13.191
Where you going?

28:14.902 --> 28:16.777
- Shaver Mines.
- Oh-ho.

28:17.363 --> 28:18.821
Lucanina, huh?

28:18.989 --> 28:20.406
I know that place.

28:20.574 --> 28:24.952
I know the man who owns it, too.
I know that fat German son of a bitch!

28:25.120 --> 28:27.580
That crazy tub of lard, Mr. Aschenbach,

28:27.748 --> 28:31.084
who wrings our people dry like slaves,
even his personal servants.

28:31.251 --> 28:32.627
One girl had an ass!

28:32.795 --> 28:35.254
Her cheeks were so full
and hard they were like drums.

28:35.422 --> 28:37.465
And when I got her pregnant,
what'd he do? He fired...

28:37.633 --> 28:42.095
Oh, Jesus Christ, will you shut up
and go and fix my motorcycle?

28:44.890 --> 28:46.015
Okay.

28:47.643 --> 28:48.851
Okay.

28:50.479 --> 28:53.439
Anything you say, firecracker.

29:01.949 --> 29:03.950
Take your hands off that! Out!

29:50.122 --> 29:52.665
Well, good for you, firecracker.

29:52.833 --> 29:54.542
Not even one lousy peso!

29:56.462 --> 30:00.756
I don't know why I named you Napoleon
when you have no imagination.

30:00.924 --> 30:02.425
This is a bank.

30:02.593 --> 30:06.304
- Mesa Verde.
- Sí, Papá, Mesa Verde. Mesa Verde.

30:06.472 --> 30:09.682
And if we can get
this firecracker to come with us,

30:09.850 --> 30:11.476
then we will be rich!

30:11.643 --> 30:13.603
Where does he come in?

30:14.146 --> 30:15.563
The dynamite's right here.

30:15.731 --> 30:18.900
No, no, no, you need an expert
for a thing like that.

30:19.776 --> 30:21.819
You only need matches and balls,
I tell you, Juan!

30:21.987 --> 30:23.213
And I got all of those it takes!

30:23.480 --> 30:24.690
- Sí?
- Sí.

30:31.872 --> 30:33.748
You see that tree over there?

31:02.611 --> 31:04.278
Short fuse.

31:27.177 --> 31:30.596
Now you understand
why we need the firecracker?

31:30.764 --> 31:31.973
Huh?

33:19.623 --> 33:21.707
Where the hell are we?

33:21.875 --> 33:24.585
What kind of work you do for the German?

33:26.254 --> 33:28.589
Listen, I ask you a question.

33:28.757 --> 33:30.841
What do you do for the German?

33:31.968 --> 33:35.262
- I've been looking for silver for him.
- Silver?

33:35.430 --> 33:37.890
You know something?
I don't understand you.

33:38.058 --> 33:39.767
I don't understand
how you waste your time

33:39.935 --> 33:41.977
and your holy water looking for silver.

33:42.145 --> 33:43.771
To me, that's a sin.

33:47.859 --> 33:49.360
Have you any better ideas?

33:49.528 --> 33:52.154
Sí, I think gold is better than silver.

33:53.031 --> 33:55.241
There isn't any gold in these hills.

33:56.076 --> 33:57.284
Yes, there is.

33:57.452 --> 33:59.120
In Mesa Verde.

34:02.416 --> 34:04.083
Mesa Verde?

34:04.251 --> 34:06.001
It's a city.

34:06.586 --> 34:07.628
Of course it's a city!

34:07.796 --> 34:10.297
Whoever heard
of having a bank in the country?

34:13.570 --> 34:14.879
Uh-huh.

34:15.469 --> 34:16.679
A bank.

34:18.306 --> 34:21.766
Not, "a bank." The bank!

34:22.518 --> 34:24.478
The most beautiful,

34:25.147 --> 34:30.150
wonderful, fantastic, gorgeous,
magnificent bank in the whole world.

34:30.318 --> 34:33.154
When you stand before the bank,

34:33.321 --> 34:36.157
and you see it has the gates of gold,

34:36.324 --> 34:38.324
like it was the gates of Heaven.

34:38.493 --> 34:43.998
And when you go inside, everything,
everything is gold!

34:44.166 --> 34:47.710
Gold spittoons, gold handles and money.

34:47.878 --> 34:50.838
Money, money is everywhere.

34:51.005 --> 34:54.842
I know 'cause I saw this
when I was eight years old.

34:55.010 --> 34:56.719
I went there with my father.

34:56.887 --> 34:58.846
He tried to rob the bank,
but they caught him.

34:59.014 --> 35:01.390
But they will never catch me, eh, Papá?

35:01.558 --> 35:02.892
Right.

35:03.059 --> 35:06.020
Listen, firecracker.
Now, you listen to me.

35:09.357 --> 35:12.359
Listen, why don't you come with me, eh?

35:12.527 --> 35:14.820
And we will work together.

35:15.864 --> 35:18.949
And we will become rich.

35:23.455 --> 35:26.624
Hey, what the hell is your name?

35:28.418 --> 35:29.877
Sean.

35:30.712 --> 35:32.004
What?

35:34.049 --> 35:35.424
John.

35:39.721 --> 35:41.430
What is your name?

35:42.224 --> 35:43.349
John.

35:44.226 --> 35:46.894
That's fantastic!
That is incredible!

35:47.062 --> 35:49.104
My name is Juan, and yours is John.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.690
- It's Juan and John, eh?
- So what?

35:51.858 --> 35:54.401
What do you mean, "So what?"
Can't you understand it? That is...

35:54.569 --> 35:55.820
That is...

35:56.307 --> 35:58.350
Oh...

35:58.532 --> 35:59.907
Destiny.

37:37.672 --> 37:40.341
- No, and I mean it.
- Why?

37:41.760 --> 37:44.553
Listen, if it's more money that you
want, I'll give you more than half.

37:44.721 --> 37:45.763
I don't care about the money.

37:45.931 --> 37:49.683
That doesn't interest me
as long as we can work together, eh?

37:50.060 --> 37:51.894
Come on, listen to what I'm telling you.

37:52.062 --> 37:53.437
We are like two brothers.

37:53.605 --> 37:56.857
I mean, you make the holes
with the holy water,

37:57.025 --> 38:01.236
and then I will go in, and I'll walk in
and do the dirty work, eh?

38:01.404 --> 38:05.032
Listen, it takes one bandido
to know another.

38:26.972 --> 38:29.431
- So, you can read, huh?
- You don't have to read, you know.

38:29.599 --> 38:31.767
I see a man's picture.
Underneath it, I see a price,

38:31.935 --> 38:34.228
so I know that man is in trouble, no?

38:41.111 --> 38:42.277
Hey.

38:43.363 --> 38:45.531
What kind of trouble you in?

38:50.413 --> 38:51.256
Oh...

38:51.413 --> 38:54.456
We fought in the revolution in Ireland.

38:54.624 --> 38:56.041
A revolution?

38:56.209 --> 38:58.085
Seems to me the revolutions
are all over the world.

38:58.253 --> 39:00.921
You know, they're like the crops.
We had a revolution here.

39:01.089 --> 39:02.840
When it started,
all the brave people went in it,

39:03.008 --> 39:04.174
and what it did to them was terrible.

39:04.342 --> 39:07.428
Pancho Villa, the best bandit chief
in the world, you know that?

39:07.595 --> 39:09.763
This man had two balls like the bull.

39:09.931 --> 39:12.099
He went in the revolution
as a great bandit.

39:12.267 --> 39:13.726
When he came out, he came out as what?

39:13.893 --> 39:16.437
Nothing. A general, eh?

39:16.604 --> 39:18.772
That, to me, is the bullshit.

39:22.444 --> 39:23.944
Wait a minute.

39:25.864 --> 39:28.282
You come here to join the revolution?

39:29.701 --> 39:30.951
No.

39:34.539 --> 39:36.498
No, one was enough for me.

39:41.713 --> 39:47.426
Stop, you dirty son-of-a-bitch!

39:48.178 --> 39:50.971
Gringo, bastard!

41:43.710 --> 41:44.835
Hey!

41:51.134 --> 41:52.759
Duck, you sucker!

43:03.581 --> 43:05.832
Say, which way is it to Lucanina?

43:06.000 --> 43:08.877
Fuck you! You go find it for yourself!

43:09.587 --> 43:10.754
Mexico is big

43:10.922 --> 43:14.132
but for you it is going to be very big!

45:06.287 --> 45:08.747
John! Where are you?

45:08.915 --> 45:10.123
It's us!

45:14.796 --> 45:17.130
Come on. Come on, you.

45:22.220 --> 45:23.929
Come on in there.

45:24.097 --> 45:28.308
Just a little further inside.

45:28.476 --> 45:32.396
That's right, heathen bastards.

45:33.689 --> 45:37.067
What's this? You crazy?
You talking to yourself now?

45:37.235 --> 45:41.571
Oh, my friend,
didn't I tell you Mexico was big?

45:45.201 --> 45:47.327
Oh, shit.

45:48.246 --> 45:50.288
Who are those people inside?

45:51.582 --> 45:55.168
You mean, who were those people inside.

46:20.278 --> 46:23.572
Who were they?
Who were those people inside?

46:23.739 --> 46:24.865
Chulo!

46:30.496 --> 46:33.048
Who were those people,
for Christ's sake?

46:33.216 --> 46:35.375
Well, one of them was Aschenbach,

46:35.543 --> 46:39.546
then there was three soldiers,
and then there was one captain.

46:39.714 --> 46:41.673
Everybody's dead in there.

46:41.841 --> 46:45.719
Will you keep quiet and go get
our friend's equipment together?

46:47.138 --> 46:52.392
Anyway, when I went
to Aschenbach and I told him,

46:53.227 --> 46:56.855
I said you wanted to see him,
he wouldn't believe that, you see.

46:57.023 --> 47:00.984
I said, "Well, that's too bad
because he's discovered silver there."

47:01.152 --> 47:03.069
When he heard that,
he was ready to come running.

47:03.237 --> 47:04.279
But the other one, the captain...

47:04.447 --> 47:06.573
By the way,
I think that the captain and Aschenbach,

47:06.741 --> 47:08.283
they were working together, see?

47:08.451 --> 47:11.286
The captain says,
"I want to see the man."

47:11.454 --> 47:12.579
I said to the captain,

47:12.747 --> 47:15.957
"How can you see a man
when he has blown off one of his hands

47:16.125 --> 47:18.710
"with a stick of dynamite,
and he is bleeding to death?"

47:18.878 --> 47:22.631
When they heard that,
they broke their asses to get here.

47:24.383 --> 47:26.051
Anyway, you don't have
any problem, you see,

47:26.219 --> 47:29.012
because they're dead,
and there's no questions.

47:29.180 --> 47:33.433
Also, you have no contract,
so you are free.

47:35.937 --> 47:37.771
Of course, there is one little problem.

47:37.939 --> 47:41.107
That will be with the Army
because they will have a hard ass

47:41.275 --> 47:44.402
when it comes to the death
of one of their captains.

47:44.570 --> 47:45.862
But you don't have to worry about that

47:46.030 --> 47:47.906
because I am your friend, Juan,
and I will help you.

47:48.074 --> 47:49.699
I will do anything, believe me.

47:49.867 --> 47:51.159
I will say anything you tell me to say.

47:51.327 --> 47:52.327
No, no, no.

47:52.495 --> 47:56.248
I don't need any help from you
to know I've been screwed.

47:58.334 --> 48:00.794
You fucking chicken thief.

48:08.344 --> 48:10.262
What do you want with me?

48:14.225 --> 48:15.475
Nothing.

48:17.144 --> 48:18.979
I just thought that maybe

48:20.356 --> 48:24.901
we could go to Mesa Verde.

48:29.323 --> 48:30.824
The bank.

48:30.992 --> 48:33.952
Isn't there anything else
you remember about Mesa Verde?

48:34.120 --> 48:36.496
Oh, yes, there's a place, you know,
where you can...

48:36.664 --> 48:38.582
You can go in and sit down and eat.

48:38.749 --> 48:40.750
And when you look
in front of you there...

48:40.918 --> 48:42.335
See the bank.

48:42.503 --> 48:44.546
That's right. How you know that?

48:45.464 --> 48:48.717
Listen. Mesa Verde,
that's only the beginning.

48:48.884 --> 48:55.640
Let me tell you, it'll be Juan and John,
the two especialistas in banks, eh?

48:57.852 --> 49:00.312
We'll call it Johnny and Johnny,
you know?

49:00.479 --> 49:01.688
That's more American, you know.

49:01.856 --> 49:03.189
Hey, amigo, we go to America,

49:03.357 --> 49:04.899
where you have banks
all over the place, you know.

49:05.152 --> 49:09.037
In California, Colorado,
Kansas City, Texas and Austin.

49:09.205 --> 49:12.282
You know, you have to think
of the big future

49:12.450 --> 49:14.034
that we have ahead of us.

49:14.201 --> 49:17.370
Well, I'm thinking
there's a big train behind us.

49:17.538 --> 49:19.873
Hey! Out of the way!

53:00.928 --> 53:02.178
Hey, you.

53:04.598 --> 53:06.516
I know that face.

53:07.977 --> 53:10.019
Where have I seen you before?

53:40.968 --> 53:42.802
Stop right where you are.

53:50.311 --> 53:52.562
Drop that knife, you bastard.

54:05.868 --> 54:07.452
I have family.

54:27.014 --> 54:28.973
I have a family, too, eh?

56:09.992 --> 56:13.036
THE GOVERNOR LOVES THE PEOPLE
THE PEOPLE LOVE THE GOVERNOR

56:25.215 --> 56:26.716
Beautiful, eh?

56:27.760 --> 56:29.177
My children...

56:33.816 --> 56:41.615
Uno dos, uno dos, uno dos.
Pelotón izquierda.

56:43.501 --> 56:46.294
Uno dos, uno dos, uno dos.

56:51.841 --> 56:54.302
Uno dos, uno dos, uno dos.

57:28.877 --> 57:31.087
Tienen algo qué pedir?

57:47.478 --> 57:49.939
Y tu?

58:10.750 --> 58:13.170
Listos

58:22.720 --> 58:24.096
Armas.

58:30.644 --> 58:32.146
Preparen.

58:38.819 --> 58:40.904
Apunten.

58:45.617 --> 58:48.745
Fuego.

58:59.119 --> 59:02.788
Hey, God, you sure this is Mesa Verde?

01:00:46.768 --> 01:00:49.061
Do you have your beans
with chili or not?

01:00:49.229 --> 01:00:51.522
I don't want nothing from you.

01:00:52.483 --> 01:00:53.244
Ah...

01:00:53.483 --> 01:00:56.444
-  Come on, have some beans.
- Listen to me, you son of a bitch!

01:00:56.611 --> 01:01:00.281
You pull that trick on me one more time,
I break your goddamn head!

01:01:02.326 --> 01:01:04.410
Well, for Christ's sake.

01:01:06.413 --> 01:01:08.414
The train comes along, and I take it.

01:01:08.582 --> 01:01:10.750
I've been waiting for you
in your Mesa Verde ever since.

01:01:10.917 --> 01:01:13.002
It's not my Mesa Verde.
This place has changed! It's shit.

01:01:13.170 --> 01:01:14.628
It's covered with the soldiers
like the flies.

01:01:14.796 --> 01:01:16.922
Hey, hey. Just the way we like it.

01:01:18.592 --> 01:01:21.427
What do you mean,
that's just the way we like it?

01:01:24.806 --> 01:01:27.099
If it's a revolution,

01:01:27.267 --> 01:01:28.976
it's confusion.

01:02:15.273 --> 01:02:18.317
What are you talking about?
Revolution, confusion?

01:02:20.821 --> 01:02:22.154
Where there's confusion,

01:02:22.322 --> 01:02:26.158
a man who knows what he wants
stands a good chance of getting it.

01:02:26.326 --> 01:02:27.910
I don't understand you.

01:02:37.337 --> 01:02:38.671
This him?

01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.177
That's him.

01:02:50.892 --> 01:02:52.184
Him, who?

01:02:53.145 --> 01:02:55.187
- Do you trust me?
- No.

01:02:55.814 --> 01:02:57.148
Well, you want to get
inside over there?

01:02:57.315 --> 01:02:58.190
Sí.

01:02:59.151 --> 01:03:01.986
Well, I'm gonna see to it
you have that chance.

01:03:02.154 --> 01:03:03.320
Come on.

01:03:24.050 --> 01:03:26.886
Don't move, God damn it!
Hold him still!

01:04:00.587 --> 01:04:02.004
That does it.

01:04:03.215 --> 01:04:05.299
Relax, now. Relax.

01:04:06.593 --> 01:04:07.927
It's all over.

01:04:09.179 --> 01:04:11.931
If you'd let this infection
go any longer,

01:04:12.098 --> 01:04:14.391
your widow would be paying my bill.

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:23.234
Mallory!

01:04:24.361 --> 01:04:27.446
You've hardly joined us here
in Mesa Verde,

01:04:28.698 --> 01:04:31.367
and already you're front-page news.

01:04:33.161 --> 01:04:35.996
"Irish dynamiter wanted for murder."

01:04:42.337 --> 01:04:45.589
You have a real talent
for making friends.

01:04:47.133 --> 01:04:49.885
You know,
you've stirred up a hornet's nest.

01:04:50.053 --> 01:04:51.637
IRISH DYNAMITER WANTED FOR MURDER

01:04:51.805 --> 01:04:55.015
I'll grant you the captain,
but, till now,

01:04:56.017 --> 01:04:59.186
nobody dared take a crack
at foreign capitalists,

01:04:59.854 --> 01:05:01.730
not even Pancho Villa.

01:05:03.275 --> 01:05:05.526
It seems even His
Majesty's Secret Service

01:05:05.694 --> 01:05:07.611
would like to get their hands on you.

01:05:09.823 --> 01:05:12.324
And--- Yet, you are an asset to us.

01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:17.496
Even if sometimes
you do drink a bit too much.

01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:19.498
Who says I drink too much?

01:05:21.751 --> 01:05:23.210
Your liver does.

01:05:23.378 --> 01:05:25.254
What about that one? Him?

01:05:27.173 --> 01:05:28.674
He's all right.

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:32.428
Except that when operating,
he cuts deeper than I do.

01:05:33.597 --> 01:05:38.350
What the doctor means is,
one time, we did a little work together.

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:42.062
And now, to our work, friends.

01:05:43.648 --> 01:05:45.357
I have good news.

01:05:46.192 --> 01:05:48.694
In two days, Villa and Zapata

01:05:48.862 --> 01:05:52.072
will attack simultaneously
from north and south.

01:05:54.034 --> 01:05:56.201
We here, like those in other cities,

01:05:56.369 --> 01:05:59.079
must begin parallel
actions of harassment.

01:05:59.539 --> 01:06:02.708
Huerta's downfall
is just a question of weeks.

01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:05.878
Whereas Miguel's
is only a question of hours

01:06:06.046 --> 01:06:07.880
if he doesn't stop smoking.

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:10.299
Easy to say.

01:06:11.926 --> 01:06:15.179
Well, we'll attack in four places
at the same time.

01:06:15.347 --> 01:06:19.016
Antonio, you and your men are to
hit the city hall and the old prisons,

01:06:19.184 --> 01:06:21.393
so it will be necessary
to divide into two groups,

01:06:21.561 --> 01:06:24.146
one of them under the command of José.

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:26.815
Now, Jesus, the railway station

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:29.401
and the marshaling yards
as planned, right?

01:06:29.569 --> 01:06:31.779
And make sure
you're in position in plenty of time,

01:06:31.946 --> 01:06:34.073
and in small groups,
so you won't attract attention.

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:36.241
And don't forget to act
like ordinary travelers

01:06:36.409 --> 01:06:37.660
or railroad employees.

01:06:37.827 --> 01:06:40.079
You, Manolo, together with Juanito,

01:06:40.246 --> 01:06:42.581
will attack the army barracks
with our main forces.

01:06:42.749 --> 01:06:43.916
Agreed?

01:06:44.626 --> 01:06:48.003
This, mind you, is their point
of maximum concentration.

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:50.923
That is the key to the success
of our plan.

01:06:51.091 --> 01:06:54.718
You must create the impression
of a massive attack.

01:06:54.886 --> 01:06:58.639
And, if necessary,
be prepared to make the final sacrifice.

01:06:59.474 --> 01:07:03.352
The fourth and last target,
Ortega, the post office.

01:07:04.938 --> 01:07:07.981
When the enemy is busy on four fronts,

01:07:08.692 --> 01:07:11.652
we'll move against our real objective.

01:07:12.237 --> 01:07:13.946
Are we still agreeing?

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:19.868
- Now, you'll need men.
- I only need one man.

01:07:22.997 --> 01:07:24.123
One?

01:07:24.989 --> 01:07:27.033
Sí.---

01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:29.044
Him.

01:07:31.131 --> 01:07:35.092
Him? Him? What is this with this "him"?

01:07:35.260 --> 01:07:37.803
Him, who? Who, him? To do what?

01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:40.848
- That's what I want to know!
- To attack the bank.

01:07:43.810 --> 01:07:45.185
The bank?

01:07:47.021 --> 01:07:49.398
We will take care of the bank.

01:07:49.566 --> 01:07:52.943
I mean, that's why we're here,
so don't you worry about that.

01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:58.365
Well, then, what can I say,

01:07:58.533 --> 01:08:01.994
except I hope you make it?

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:04.997
Me, too. And him.

01:08:06.833 --> 01:08:10.669
Well, we'll meet again tonight
to discuss details.

01:08:10.837 --> 01:08:12.004
I have to go now.

01:08:12.172 --> 01:08:13.589
I left a woman in labor,

01:08:13.757 --> 01:08:16.383
and she can't wait
till the revolution's over.

01:08:20.332 --> 01:08:24.087
- Tierra y libertad.
- Tierra y libertad.

01:08:24.684 --> 01:08:27.019
Now, go upstairs
and leave one at a time,

01:08:27.187 --> 01:08:28.604
and keep out of sight.

01:08:28.772 --> 01:08:31.439
Speaking of sight, how's your cataract?

01:08:31.219 --> 01:08:34.639
At least I have a good eye. With the other...---

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:34.943
Well...

01:08:36.237 --> 01:08:38.447
Shh!--- You don't have to say anything.

01:08:39.866 --> 01:08:42.618
I understand everything.

01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:45.807
Tierra y libertad.

01:08:46.649 --> 01:08:48.902
Y libertad.

01:10:17.486 --> 01:10:20.156
Capitán.
Aviselas Capitán.

01:10:20.365 --> 01:10:22.784
Pronto.
Hola muénvase.

01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:45.532
Go.

01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:48.994
Psst, psst. Oye.---

01:10:56.336 --> 01:10:57.586
Bravo, Chulo.

01:11:01.633 --> 01:11:03.550
Take it. Take it.

01:11:16.356 --> 01:11:18.690
Boy, there must be
a lot of money in the bank.

01:11:18.858 --> 01:11:20.692
Look at all the soldiers.

01:11:27.241 --> 01:11:28.909
Do you know how this works?

01:11:29.077 --> 01:11:31.078
Sí, it's a...

01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:34.331
Short fuse.

01:11:35.833 --> 01:11:38.418
- No.
- No?

01:11:39.170 --> 01:11:40.337
Normal rate.

01:11:41.881 --> 01:11:43.382
Thirty seconds.

01:11:45.969 --> 01:11:47.511
Sí--- Thirty seconds.

01:12:51.909 --> 01:12:53.493
What'd you find?

01:12:54.037 --> 01:12:56.204
Nothing but scrap paper.

01:12:59.167 --> 01:13:02.669
Wait a minute.
Hey, it's pointing down there.

01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:19.936
Psst.

01:15:41.037 --> 01:15:42.412
There's the safe!

01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:12.067
Duck, you suckers!

01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:55.151
- Where you going, for Christ's sake?
- I don't know.

01:16:55.319 --> 01:16:57.487
I don't know, but something's wrong!

01:16:57.655 --> 01:16:58.697
I went into the bank.

01:16:58.864 --> 01:17:01.658
When I go in the bank, there's
nothing there, no money, nothing.

01:17:01.826 --> 01:17:03.159
Well, the bank and the money

01:17:03.327 --> 01:17:05.829
were transferred to Mexico City
over a month ago.

01:17:05.997 --> 01:17:09.499
They've been using this place
for a political prison ever since.

01:17:09.667 --> 01:17:10.834
What?

01:17:12.420 --> 01:17:14.045
What do you mean, a political prison?

01:17:14.213 --> 01:17:16.381
Well, I never said a thing about money.

01:17:16.549 --> 01:17:19.467
All I asked you was
if you wanted to get inside.

01:17:19.635 --> 01:17:22.220
Yeah, but you know
that this bank is my life!

01:17:22.388 --> 01:17:24.014
This is my dream!

01:17:24.181 --> 01:17:26.558
Well, the reality of that is

01:17:26.726 --> 01:17:30.562
you just liberated 150 patriots
through sheer courage

01:17:30.730 --> 01:17:32.314
in the face of danger.

01:17:39.905 --> 01:17:40.947
Ah--- Yes.

01:17:44.744 --> 01:17:47.579
You're a grand hero
of the revolution now.

01:17:49.390 --> 01:17:50.670
Vivela Juan!

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:54.544
I don't want to be a hero!
All I want is the money! The money!

01:17:56.297 --> 01:17:58.423
You taught me one thing!

01:17:59.133 --> 01:18:00.258
What?

01:18:00.718 --> 01:18:03.261
How to get fucked!

01:19:30.182 --> 01:19:31.599
What's that?

01:19:32.643 --> 01:19:34.018
It's a map.

01:19:36.772 --> 01:19:39.399
It's your country
you're lying all over there.

01:19:40.943 --> 01:19:42.819
It's not my country.

01:19:42.987 --> 01:19:46.030
My country is me and my family.

01:19:46.198 --> 01:19:49.242
Well, your country's also Huerta,

01:19:49.410 --> 01:19:51.828
and the Governor, the landlords,

01:19:52.413 --> 01:19:54.789
and Günther Ruiz and his locusts.

01:19:56.083 --> 01:19:57.876
It's a little revolution
we're having here.

01:19:58.043 --> 01:20:00.086
Revolution?
What do you mean revolution?

01:20:00.254 --> 01:20:02.130
Please don't try to tell me
about revolution.

01:20:02.298 --> 01:20:04.132
I know all about the revolutions
and how they start!

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:05.258
The people that read the books,

01:20:05.426 --> 01:20:07.010
they go to the people
that don't read the books,

01:20:07.178 --> 01:20:10.722
the poor people, and say,
"The time has come to have a change!"

01:20:10.941 --> 01:20:13.850
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!
Shit! Shush!

01:20:14.018 --> 01:20:17.729
I know what I'm talking about
when I'm talking about the revolution.

01:20:18.647 --> 01:20:19.898
The people who read the books

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:21.566
go to the people who
can't read the books,

01:20:21.734 --> 01:20:23.860
the poor people, and say,
"We have to have a change."

01:20:24.028 --> 01:20:26.070
So the poor people make the change, huh?

01:20:26.238 --> 01:20:27.739
And then the people that read the books,

01:20:27.907 --> 01:20:30.158
they all sit around the big,
polished tables

01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:32.410
and they talk and talk
and eat and eat, eh?

01:20:32.578 --> 01:20:34.913
But what has happened
to the poor people?

01:20:36.624 --> 01:20:38.082
They're dead!

01:20:41.045 --> 01:20:42.921
That's your revolution!

01:20:49.842 --> 01:20:51.803
Shh.---

01:20:51.847 --> 01:20:56.100
So, please, don't tell me
about revolutions.

01:21:07.446 --> 01:21:09.072
And what happens afterwards?

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:11.783
The same fucking thing
starts all over again!

01:21:52.919 --> 01:21:55.380
Capitán.

01:22:09.810 --> 01:22:12.271
Vamos.

01:22:27.151 --> 01:22:29.110
Well, I don't like it, either.

01:22:29.278 --> 01:22:31.404
Only Günther Ruiz
is less than 20 miles from here.

01:22:31.572 --> 01:22:34.616
He's on the road that leads
to that bridge down there.

01:22:35.492 --> 01:22:38.328
They will comb the area bush by bush.

01:22:38.871 --> 01:22:42.999
That's why the order is to pull back
and hide in the San Ysidro caves.

01:22:43.542 --> 01:22:45.543
Oh, that's a brilliant order.

01:22:47.546 --> 01:22:49.255
Here we are facing it.

01:22:50.549 --> 01:22:53.509
And you and the rest of you
in a cell or someplace, dreaming,

01:22:53.677 --> 01:22:55.595
while I'm pissing up against the wall!

01:22:55.763 --> 01:22:57.722
Not everybody can fight.

01:22:58.307 --> 01:23:00.725
There are those who must organize,
coordinate.

01:23:00.893 --> 01:23:02.685
Yes, yes, of course.

01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:09.567
Yeah, well, don't pay
any attention to me.

01:23:11.236 --> 01:23:12.695
It's personal.

01:23:24.416 --> 01:23:26.751
Sorry about those orders. I'm staying.

01:23:28.754 --> 01:23:31.506
I don't give a fuck about
your revolutions.

01:23:31.674 --> 01:23:35.009
I'm tired, running up and down
these mountains, getting nowhere.

01:23:35.177 --> 01:23:36.719
So I've stopped.

01:23:36.887 --> 01:23:39.972
Right here at the bridge of San Jorge.

01:23:42.976 --> 01:23:47.021
Maybe it's out of spite
for you and your slow dream.

01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:48.564
Or maybe...

01:23:49.900 --> 01:23:52.026
Ah--- Maybe my feet are sore.

01:24:02.121 --> 01:24:04.747
Well, if he's gonna stay,
I'm gonna stay, too.

01:24:04.915 --> 01:24:07.583
I don't know,
maybe 'cause my feet are sore, too, huh?

01:24:10.045 --> 01:24:12.922
Hombres, me and the irlandés here,

01:24:13.090 --> 01:24:16.384
we're gonna catch ourselves
a couple of the fucking locusts!

01:24:17.136 --> 01:24:18.586
Atente.

01:24:19.471 --> 01:24:21.347
You go back and hide in the grotto!

01:24:21.515 --> 01:24:25.226
And if things go bad here,
then every man for himself!

01:24:25.394 --> 01:24:27.145
You move your asses!

01:24:27.396 --> 01:24:28.646
Comprenden?

01:25:00.179 --> 01:25:01.929
If something happens

01:25:02.681 --> 01:25:05.349
and your father doesn't come back,

01:25:05.517 --> 01:25:09.854
then I pray that the
great God in Heaven takes care of you.

01:25:34.713 --> 01:25:36.005
Well...

01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:40.551
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

01:26:04.117 --> 01:26:05.284
Listen.

01:26:05.452 --> 01:26:08.496
When they are out of sight,
we will make a run for it. Sí?---

01:26:17.005 --> 01:26:18.047
No?

01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:19.924
You can't mean to stay here.

01:26:20.092 --> 01:26:22.927
All those explosions
must have gone to your head!

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:27.974
Remember?

01:26:28.141 --> 01:26:29.934
John and Juan?

01:26:31.687 --> 01:26:32.937
America?

01:26:34.815 --> 01:26:36.315
The millions?

01:26:37.192 --> 01:26:38.276
No?

01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:40.736
No.

01:26:42.281 --> 01:26:43.281
I don't understand you.

01:26:43.448 --> 01:26:46.033
I thought you made some kind of a trick
so we can get out of here.

01:26:46.201 --> 01:26:47.994
What can the two of us
do against those locusts?

01:26:48.161 --> 01:26:50.997
Oh, you'd be doing me a great favor
if you'd leave!

01:26:51.164 --> 01:26:54.584
If it's a choice I have to make
between a chicken thief

01:26:54.751 --> 01:26:57.336
and ridding the world of a few uniforms,

01:26:57.504 --> 01:27:00.214
I'll not be choosing the chicken thief!

01:27:02.676 --> 01:27:03.801
Okay.

01:27:07.639 --> 01:27:08.723
Okay.

01:27:10.976 --> 01:27:12.018
No!

01:27:14.813 --> 01:27:16.522
Oh, no, no, no!

01:27:16.690 --> 01:27:18.649
You will like that, huh?

01:27:19.318 --> 01:27:22.695
Well, you listen to me,

01:27:22.863 --> 01:27:26.407
you Irish piece of shit!

01:27:26.825 --> 01:27:30.328
You think you're the only man
in the world who has the balls to stay.

01:27:30.495 --> 01:27:35.124
Well, you are wrong!
Because I have the balls and I stay!

01:27:54.561 --> 01:27:55.811
He says there's no danger.

01:27:55.979 --> 01:27:59.023
All you have to do
is watch the bridge from a long way.

01:28:00.734 --> 01:28:04.362
No matter how I look with them,
I'm still too close to the bridge.

01:28:06.490 --> 01:28:09.617
Why am I mixed up
in this revolution in the first place?

01:28:09.785 --> 01:28:11.702
Go ahead, you tell me, God.
What am I doing here?

01:28:11.870 --> 01:28:15.873
Why didn't you strike me dead instead
of letting me say, "I stay, too"?

01:28:18.043 --> 01:28:20.920
Look at him. Look at him.
All because of him.

01:28:21.088 --> 01:28:22.880
He acts like a tourist
that's going somewhere,

01:28:23.048 --> 01:28:25.007
only he's staying, huh?

01:28:25.175 --> 01:28:26.759
Look at him.

01:28:26.927 --> 01:28:28.636
What the hell does he care?

01:28:28.804 --> 01:28:30.930
He is having fun.

01:28:32.099 --> 01:28:36.435
I'm glad he's having fun, God,
because I am not having fun.

01:28:37.187 --> 01:28:38.354
Oh-ho--- No.

01:28:42.567 --> 01:28:43.651
Hey.

01:28:45.195 --> 01:28:46.570
What's this?

01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:54.036
Now he goes to sleep, eh?

01:28:55.163 --> 01:28:58.249
Go ahead. You sleep. Sleep.

01:28:59.418 --> 01:29:02.712
I'll tell you something.
When he's asleep, I'll go. Shh!---

01:29:07.134 --> 01:29:09.760
May the good Lord watch over you.

01:29:56.391 --> 01:29:58.476
Stop over there, Sergeant.

01:30:27.506 --> 01:30:28.672
Hey.

01:30:33.345 --> 01:30:36.639
God, only an idiot could sleep
at a time like this!

01:30:41.812 --> 01:30:42.853
Hey!

01:32:18.033 --> 01:32:19.116
Abandon the trucks!

01:32:19.284 --> 01:32:21.577
Break ranks
and take cover under the bridge!

01:32:21.745 --> 01:32:24.330
Artillery, fire at will!

01:37:45.735 --> 01:37:47.236
All of them.

01:37:50.532 --> 01:37:51.823
Six.

01:37:56.162 --> 01:37:58.455
I've never counted them before.

01:39:45.605 --> 01:39:47.939
No, Juan, no.

01:39:48.107 --> 01:39:51.902
No, for Christ's sake.
They're waiting for you out there.

01:42:38.678 --> 01:42:40.846
No se mueven.

01:42:40.971 --> 01:42:43.057
Capitán.

01:42:45.993 --> 01:42:48.829
Hold it!
Load that bastard onto the truck!

01:42:49.664 --> 01:42:52.624
And see to it
that he gets to the camp alive!

01:46:02.722 --> 01:46:05.058
Uno dos uno.

01:46:14.276 --> 01:46:18.280
Uno dos, uno dos.

01:46:23.059 --> 01:46:26.270
Uno dos, uno dos, uno dos.

01:46:27.688 --> 01:46:30.775
Pelotón alto.

01:46:32.860 --> 01:46:34.120
Lzquierda.

01:46:34.345 --> 01:46:36.430
Posición de tiro.

01:46:43.828 --> 01:46:45.413
Tienen algo qué pedir?

01:46:51.536 --> 01:46:53.913
Pelotón.

01:46:57.133 --> 01:46:59.427
Preparen.

01:46:59.552 --> 01:47:01.763
Armas.

01:47:02.806 --> 01:47:04.849
'Apunten'

01:50:50.665 --> 01:50:52.751
Tienes algo qué pedir?

01:51:44.274 --> 01:51:46.693
Posición de tiro.

01:51:52.891 --> 01:51:55.227
Preparen armas.

01:51:58.672 --> 01:52:00.007
Apunten.

01:52:00.798 --> 01:52:02.465
Duck, you sucker.

01:53:40.105 --> 01:53:42.732
MEXICO RAILWAY

01:54:50.711 --> 01:54:54.006
Preparen.
Armas.

01:55:01.029 --> 01:55:02.489
Apunten.

01:55:02.914 --> 01:55:04.166
Fuego.

01:57:19.074 --> 01:57:21.117
But for the rich you sing.

01:57:35.924 --> 01:57:37.675
Oh, Jesus, Juan.

01:57:43.557 --> 01:57:45.891
Anyway, I'd say if they'd ever
get this thing under way,

01:57:46.059 --> 01:57:47.685
you might be able to...

01:57:49.146 --> 01:57:51.814
Well, you'd be able to
make the border by what?

01:57:52.315 --> 01:57:54.775
Sometime tonight, don't you think?

01:57:58.697 --> 01:57:59.989
America.

01:58:01.533 --> 01:58:03.284
It's America, Juan!

01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:07.121
Oh, Jesus, if it's as great
as they say it is,

01:58:08.039 --> 01:58:10.499
filled with banks,
stuffed full of dreams!

01:58:10.667 --> 01:58:11.917
Juan.

01:58:17.215 --> 01:58:19.717
Oh, Jesus.

01:58:23.096 --> 01:58:25.306
Jesus, Juan.

01:58:28.185 --> 01:58:31.520
What is it, Juan and John?

01:58:33.523 --> 01:58:35.191
Johnny and Johnny?

01:58:36.359 --> 01:58:38.611
I make the holes and you get in.

01:58:38.779 --> 01:58:40.446
Fifty-fifty, right?

02:00:05.365 --> 02:00:06.991
What's happening?

02:00:07.951 --> 02:00:10.327
Oh--- They're just moving the train around.

02:00:11.788 --> 02:00:13.789
Seems we'll be leaving shortly.

02:00:15.709 --> 02:00:19.461
The uniforms just finished
loading on the last of their shit.

02:00:36.563 --> 02:00:40.024
The Revolutionary forces of Pancho Villa

02:00:40.191 --> 02:00:43.527
come close to Mexico City.

02:03:18.183 --> 02:03:19.933
Get out of the way!

02:03:29.778 --> 02:03:32.321
What do you want from me, you scum?

02:03:33.198 --> 02:03:34.490
Let me by!

02:05:24.225 --> 02:05:25.601
It's yours.

02:05:30.064 --> 02:05:32.065
There's a fortune inside.

02:05:33.401 --> 02:05:34.568
Money.

02:05:35.778 --> 02:05:36.945
Jewels.

02:05:37.780 --> 02:05:38.947
Pearls.

02:07:27.223 --> 02:07:28.723
Jóvenes a México.

02:07:57.920 --> 02:08:00.881
Well, this train will not
be going to America.

02:08:01.924 --> 02:08:04.426
Maybe the train won't, but we will.

02:08:18.483 --> 02:08:19.566
Hey.

02:08:22.445 --> 02:08:24.279
Which way is America?

02:08:29.243 --> 02:08:31.495
Well, it's sure as hell not that way.

02:08:33.039 --> 02:08:34.456
That's the way.

02:08:38.127 --> 02:08:39.586
Well, then...

02:08:46.969 --> 02:08:48.303
Let's go.

02:09:06.989 --> 02:09:09.491
Even Pancho Villa's heard
much about you.

02:09:09.992 --> 02:09:13.662
He's always saying,
"I want to meet this Miranda."

02:09:17.959 --> 02:09:19.084
Me?

02:09:21.003 --> 02:09:22.504
That's right.

02:09:23.506 --> 02:09:27.342
The military junta commander
told us everything that you've done.

02:09:27.510 --> 02:09:31.430
Whatever it was you heard,
I can assure you they were only words.

02:09:32.223 --> 02:09:33.849
But words aren't enough to describe

02:09:34.016 --> 02:09:37.018
what Juan has done
and suffered for the cause.

02:09:39.355 --> 02:09:41.189
Hey, Doctor, eh?

02:09:43.443 --> 02:09:45.026
How you been, eh?

02:09:46.446 --> 02:09:49.364
Now, this is the man
who should talk to Villa.

02:09:51.072 --> 02:09:53.658
Hey.---

02:09:56.539 --> 02:09:57.622
John.

02:10:02.044 --> 02:10:03.378
Doctor.

02:10:07.842 --> 02:10:10.385
We thought we'd lost you, Doctor.

02:10:28.154 --> 02:10:29.529
You got a light?

02:10:34.660 --> 02:10:39.331
Listen, Günther Ruiz is after us,
and now Villa wants to talk to me.

02:10:39.499 --> 02:10:41.583
I think we should get out of here.

02:10:43.127 --> 02:10:46.046
Well, Jesus, Juan, you can't leave now.

02:10:46.214 --> 02:10:49.758
You're a great, grand,
glorious hero of the revolution.

02:10:49.926 --> 02:10:51.092
Can I tell you something?

02:10:51.260 --> 02:10:52.928
- What?
- Fuck you.

02:10:59.101 --> 02:11:00.519
That's all.

02:11:14.867 --> 02:11:18.286
A military train carrying over
1,000 soldiers and heavy weapons

02:11:18.454 --> 02:11:20.413
is heading straight towards us.

02:11:20.581 --> 02:11:22.624
What about Villa's troops?

02:11:23.376 --> 02:11:25.418
He met resistance in the Sierra

02:11:25.586 --> 02:11:28.255
and asks us to hold out for 24 hours.

02:11:37.682 --> 02:11:38.974
Where the hell are we?

02:11:39.141 --> 02:11:40.892
Approximately here.

02:11:42.478 --> 02:11:44.771
Ah--- It's a beautiful desert there.

02:11:44.939 --> 02:11:48.108
Not a stream, or a canyon,
or anything in 100 miles.

02:11:48.276 --> 02:11:50.944
How long you think
it'd take them to get here?

02:11:51.112 --> 02:11:52.946
Three hours, more or less.

02:11:53.114 --> 02:11:54.447
Three hours.

02:12:08.379 --> 02:12:09.671
Well,

02:12:10.631 --> 02:12:14.050
looks as though we'll have to
stop them right here, doesn't it?

02:12:15.177 --> 02:12:18.096
All that takes is unbolting
a couple of yards of track.

02:12:18.264 --> 02:12:20.140
But then what?

02:12:20.683 --> 02:12:23.018
- They'd still slaughter us.
- Wait.

02:12:23.811 --> 02:12:26.688
There's more than
one way to stop a train.

02:12:28.274 --> 02:12:29.774
How much dynamite have we?

02:12:29.942 --> 02:12:31.776
Maybe 200 pounds.

02:12:32.153 --> 02:12:33.987
Is that enough for you?

02:12:36.032 --> 02:12:38.742
Oh, yes. It will have to do, all right.

02:12:39.910 --> 02:12:42.954
But--- I'll also need a locomotive and a man.

02:12:43.122 --> 02:12:45.040
Sí, sí, sí, sí, okay.

02:12:46.792 --> 02:12:47.876
Okay.

02:12:48.544 --> 02:12:52.047
Yes, someone who's brave
and loyal to the cause.

02:12:52.214 --> 02:12:55.258
Never mind about that.
Just tell me what I have to do.

02:12:57.011 --> 02:12:59.262
Someone like Dr. Villega, I think.

02:13:06.103 --> 02:13:07.354
Well...

02:13:10.066 --> 02:13:11.650
I'm honored.

02:13:12.401 --> 02:13:14.402
I don't doubt it, Doctor.

02:13:15.237 --> 02:13:18.823
Also because an old friend of ours
is in command of that train,

02:13:19.784 --> 02:13:21.743
a Colonel Günther Ruiz.

02:14:32.022 --> 02:14:33.606
Let's get shoveling, man.

02:14:33.774 --> 02:14:36.317
We'll never get up
enough pressure that way.

02:14:50.833 --> 02:14:53.418
Come on, put your back in it, Villega.

02:15:02.970 --> 02:15:05.180
Let's stop pretending, right away.

02:15:05.347 --> 02:15:07.474
You know everything, don't you?

02:15:07.641 --> 02:15:10.101
You sensed it, or guessed it.

02:15:10.269 --> 02:15:12.395
Simpler than that, Villega.

02:15:12.563 --> 02:15:14.272
I saw you.

02:15:14.440 --> 02:15:16.357
That night in the rain.

02:15:26.869 --> 02:15:28.077
I see.

02:15:28.996 --> 02:15:31.706
You have already judged
and condemned me.

02:15:41.383 --> 02:15:44.719
That's why you've brought me with you,
to kill me.

02:15:46.555 --> 02:15:48.264
It's easy to judge.

02:15:48.432 --> 02:15:50.391
Have you ever been tortured?

02:15:50.559 --> 02:15:52.143
Are you sure you wouldn't talk?

02:15:52.311 --> 02:15:53.686
I was sure!

02:15:54.522 --> 02:15:56.189
And yet I talked.

02:15:56.816 --> 02:15:59.192
Some men died because of me.
What should I do?

02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:01.319
Kill myself? Why?

02:16:01.487 --> 02:16:02.987
The dead remain dead.

02:16:03.155 --> 02:16:05.240
But me, I have not changed.

02:16:05.407 --> 02:16:07.408
I still believe in the same things.

02:16:07.576 --> 02:16:09.619
I can continue to serve the cause!

02:16:09.787 --> 02:16:12.914
Shut up, Villega!
Shut up, for Christ's sake!

02:18:23.837 --> 02:18:26.214
When I started using dynamite,

02:18:26.382 --> 02:18:28.758
I believed in many things.

02:18:28.925 --> 02:18:30.259
All of it!

02:18:31.887 --> 02:18:34.430
Finally, I believe only in dynamite.

02:18:35.557 --> 02:18:37.683
I don't judge you, Villega.

02:18:40.228 --> 02:18:42.563
I did that only once in my life.

02:18:44.650 --> 02:18:46.150
Get shoveling.

02:20:23.373 --> 02:20:25.291
The end of the line, Villega.

02:20:28.962 --> 02:20:30.963
And I can't help you now.

02:20:46.396 --> 02:20:48.689
Just close your eyes and jump.

02:20:57.324 --> 02:20:59.700
For Christ's sake, save yourself!

02:21:18.011 --> 02:21:19.641
Dios mío frena.

02:25:10.369 --> 02:25:12.411
Oh, shit!

02:25:14.331 --> 02:25:16.624
Oh, God!

02:26:37.164 --> 02:26:38.247
Hey.

02:26:41.001 --> 02:26:42.334
Man--- Remember huh---?

02:26:44.379 --> 02:26:46.630
You remember what you told me huh---?

02:26:48.383 --> 02:26:51.552
You told me about America

02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:56.015
and the banks and the gold.

02:26:56.183 --> 02:26:59.059
Like you told me on the train, remember?

02:27:04.232 --> 02:27:05.316
Hey.

02:27:06.151 --> 02:27:07.318
Hey.

02:27:07.486 --> 02:27:08.903
Hey.

02:27:11.031 --> 02:27:14.366
No, no, no, you son of a bitch.
Come on, you son of a bitch.

02:27:14.534 --> 02:27:16.911
Now, you know you told me that.

02:27:17.454 --> 02:27:21.248
You leave me now,
what the fuck is gonna happen to me?

02:27:24.377 --> 02:27:25.920
You'll make it, General.

02:27:26.087 --> 02:27:28.797
Oh, shit, I don't want to be a general.

02:27:35.805 --> 02:27:40.768
Come on, talk to me.
Talk. Keep talking. Talk.

02:27:40.936 --> 02:27:44.313
Talk. Tell me about Villega.
Villega. Remember Villega?

02:27:44.481 --> 02:27:45.898
- Villega?
- Sí.

02:27:47.776 --> 02:27:49.151
He died.

02:27:51.321 --> 02:27:54.323
He died a great,

02:27:55.992 --> 02:27:59.203
grand, glorious hero of the revolution.

02:28:19.558 --> 02:28:20.683
Okay.

02:28:22.143 --> 02:28:23.644
Easy, easy.

02:28:24.729 --> 02:28:26.230
I'll go.

02:28:26.398 --> 02:28:28.983
- I'll get help, huh?
- Yeah.

02:28:33.822 --> 02:28:34.989
General?

02:28:41.621 --> 02:28:43.497
- Have you a light?
- Sí.

02:29:22.412 --> 02:29:24.204
Oh, my friend,

02:29:26.207 --> 02:29:29.251
I'd just give you a royal screwing.

02:29:57.447 --> 02:29:59.239
I go get the help.

02:33:59.188 --> 02:34:00.480
Johnny!

02:34:49.364 --> 02:34:51.031
What about me?
