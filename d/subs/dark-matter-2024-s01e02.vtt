WEBVTT

02:18.388 --> 02:20.182
We just did last call, man. Sorry.

02:30.108 --> 02:32.736
Hey.

02:33.862 --> 02:36.198
You know me, right?

02:36.782 --> 02:37.991
I don't think so.

02:41.537 --> 02:42.621
Come on, Matt.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.583
How do you know me?

02:48.001 --> 02:49.962
'Cause I come in here all the time.

02:51.380 --> 02:53.423
Oh, well, I've never served you.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.467
It's Jason.

02:55.467 --> 02:56.552
Okay.

02:56.552 --> 02:59.012
There was a party tonight, man.

02:59.596 --> 03:04.268
You served us
a bottle of the Macallan Rare.

03:05.018 --> 03:06.103
You mean this bottle?

03:06.812 --> 03:07.771
Yeah.

03:07.771 --> 03:09.565
I haven't sold a drop of that all week.

03:11.817 --> 03:14.862
You just--
You opened up the back for my friend.

03:14.862 --> 03:17.739
I've never seen you before in my life.

03:24.621 --> 03:28.292
Matt. Fuck, man,
you're freaking me out, okay?

03:28.292 --> 03:32.713
It's not funny.
Just tell me you know who I am.

03:34.590 --> 03:37.050
Okay. Here's what I'm gonna tell you.

03:38.427 --> 03:41.013
Go get some fucking help
and get the fuck out of my bar.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.264
Mike!

03:42.264 --> 03:43.640
Is that gonna be a problem?

03:50.314 --> 03:51.315
No.

04:00.824 --> 04:03.035
- Mr. Dessen?
- Yes?

04:03.035 --> 04:06.663
I'm Dr. Randolph.
What brings you into the ER tonight?

04:07.206 --> 04:12.085
Well, I think that
there is something wrong with my mind.

04:25.474 --> 04:26.475
What is that?

04:27.017 --> 04:29.269
Lorazepam, to help you sleep.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.694
You're killing me.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.103
All right, Jason...

07:18.772 --> 07:21.066
where do we keep our fucking coffee?

07:36.582 --> 07:38.125
Sorry to wake you.

07:39.168 --> 07:40.460
Do you know where you are?

07:43.213 --> 07:47.801
At the John of God Hospital.

07:47.801 --> 07:49.136
Very good.

07:49.136 --> 07:52.931
I have the results from your CT scan,
and there's no brain damage.

07:52.931 --> 07:54.016
No tumors.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.769
Some shallow bruising
but nothing too serious.

07:59.688 --> 08:01.940
We also ran a tox screen.

08:02.524 --> 08:05.402
We found something I've never seen before.

08:05.402 --> 08:07.821
A psychoactive compound.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.535
You asked us to find your family.

08:14.745 --> 08:15.871
Yeah.

08:15.871 --> 08:19.833
There isn't anyone named Daniela Dessen
in all of Chicago,

08:20.667 --> 08:23.670
and no Charlie Dessen
enrolled at St. Peter High School.

08:25.797 --> 08:27.633
- No.
- I'd like to talk about

08:27.633 --> 08:30.093
what you told Dr. Randolph last night.

08:30.093 --> 08:31.386
You said...

08:33.013 --> 08:36.975
"It wasn't my house.
The furniture had been changed.

08:36.975 --> 08:39.811
The kitchen was totally remodeled."

08:43.690 --> 08:46.902
Do you really believe that, Jason?

08:55.744 --> 08:59.831
"Jason Ashley Dessen,
born in Denison, Iowa.

09:00.791 --> 09:03.502
Bachelor's degree
from the University of Chicago.

09:03.502 --> 09:06.755
PhD from the same university."
So far so good?

09:08.048 --> 09:09.299
Yeah.

09:09.299 --> 09:12.386
"Postdoctoral fellowships
at Harvard and Princeton.

09:12.386 --> 09:15.681
Awarded the Pavia Prize in 2010."

09:16.265 --> 09:20.811
And according to this article, you haven't
been seen publicly in over a year.

09:42.791 --> 09:45.752
Have you ever been hospitalized
for psychiatric care?

09:46.628 --> 09:48.922
There are places specifically tailored

09:48.922 --> 09:52.759
to help people who are experiencing
a little bit of a disconnect

09:52.759 --> 09:55.512
between what's real and what isn't.

09:55.512 --> 09:58.223
I'd like to start
by having a full evaluation done.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.933
Is that something you'd be open to?

10:02.603 --> 10:03.896
Absolutely.

10:03.896 --> 10:05.147
Thank you, Doctor.

10:14.406 --> 10:17.659
He could be out there,
spilling all our secrets.

10:18.243 --> 10:19.620
We should go to the police.

10:19.620 --> 10:23.957
We've lost four people, and you
want to bring more attention to Velocity?

10:23.957 --> 10:25.042
She's right.

10:25.584 --> 10:29.254
If you were a man of science
like Jason, where would you go?

10:31.882 --> 10:33.133
Hospital.

10:42.059 --> 10:43.268
Dr. Hollis...

10:49.858 --> 10:51.360
- Excuse me, hi.
- Hi.

10:52.444 --> 10:53.612
It's my first day here,

10:53.612 --> 10:57.491
and I was wondering
if I could borrow a pen.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.701
Yeah, sure. Here you go.

11:00.619 --> 11:01.912
I'll bring it right back.

11:05.082 --> 11:06.083
Hey, Jason.

11:07.209 --> 11:08.085
Hi.

11:21.807 --> 11:23.892
The first law of thermodynamics.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.856
Sorry. Keep going.

11:28.856 --> 11:30.899
So does anyone wanna take a shot?

11:33.902 --> 11:36.989
- Really? No one?
- What was the question?

11:37.781 --> 11:39.658
Laws of thermodynamics.

11:40.158 --> 11:41.660
The first law of thermodynamics

11:41.660 --> 11:43.620
is the law of conservation of energy.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.331
It states that energy
cannot be created or destroyed.

11:46.999 --> 11:49.293
Now, what do I mean when I say energy?

11:51.712 --> 11:54.506
Energy can be described
as the ability to do work

11:54.506 --> 11:55.757
where work--

11:56.925 --> 11:59.136
I'll take over from here.

12:14.568 --> 12:18.697
Thank you for covering for me.
Sorry I was late.

12:25.412 --> 12:27.706
You find all this a little boring...

12:29.958 --> 12:32.294
or do you already know all of this stuff?

12:34.922 --> 12:37.090
It's okay. I find it a little bit boring.

12:37.758 --> 12:38.717
It is.

12:39.843 --> 12:41.053
That's up to you.

12:44.348 --> 12:46.517
You know what true boredom looks like?

12:47.392 --> 12:51.438
Your life in five years' time when
you realize you haven't paid attention.

12:53.524 --> 12:58.237
And you'll find yourself working for other
people, likely a middle management person

12:58.237 --> 13:02.241
who takes out their frustrations
and their despair on you

13:02.241 --> 13:06.495
while you're trying to sell products
and services that you don't care about

13:06.495 --> 13:11.625
for some multinational corporation
who doesn't actually give a flying fuck...

13:13.627 --> 13:15.754
excuse my language-- if you exist.

13:15.754 --> 13:16.839
But I care,

13:17.714 --> 13:21.009
'cause for this fleeting moment--
What's your name?

13:21.009 --> 13:21.969
Riley.

13:21.969 --> 13:25.514
Riley? That's right, Riley.
For this fleeting moment,

13:25.514 --> 13:28.767
Riley and everybody else who's still
on your phones-- put them away--

13:28.767 --> 13:33.730
you get to sit in a classroom and
ponder the mysteries of our existence.

13:35.941 --> 13:37.192
And that is great.

13:37.192 --> 13:38.277
Now...

13:40.362 --> 13:44.658
I'm not expecting you
to understand everything.

13:44.658 --> 13:46.451
I'm not a cruel man.

13:47.035 --> 13:51.957
But I do expect you
to respect the opportunity.

13:53.208 --> 13:54.334
Pay attention.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.253
That's all.

13:57.254 --> 13:59.173
Like when I tell you things.

14:00.174 --> 14:02.509
For example, that in 1850,

14:02.509 --> 14:07.014
a brilliant man
by the name of Rudolf Clausius--

14:08.390 --> 14:11.393
Can you call me immediately
if you hear anything?

14:13.145 --> 14:15.814
Yeah, we're very worried about him.

14:18.192 --> 14:19.359
I appreciate it.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.038
Any news?

14:31.038 --> 14:33.582
<i>No. Dawn spoke
to someone at John of God.</i>

14:33.582 --> 14:35.125
Jason was there last night.

14:35.125 --> 14:37.252
Dawn rushed over,
but Jason had already left.

14:37.252 --> 14:39.213
Did she hear anything about his condition?

14:39.213 --> 14:41.840
No. But at least we know
he hasn't left the city.

14:42.549 --> 14:44.885
- Any luck on your end?
- I'm striking out.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.181
What about Ryan?

14:49.723 --> 14:50.724
<i>I left word.</i>

14:52.643 --> 14:56.480
Okay. Listen, keep trying.
Call me the moment you hear something.

14:56.480 --> 14:57.564
<i>I will.</i>

15:20.629 --> 15:24.132
- May I have your invitation?
- I know the artist. She's--

15:24.132 --> 15:26.343
The public opening is tomorrow.
Unfortunately, tonight is invite only.

15:26.343 --> 15:27.427
Yeah, but Daniela,

15:27.427 --> 15:29.012
- she said I could come.
- Okay. Your name?

15:30.013 --> 15:31.765
Dessen, Jason.

15:31.765 --> 15:32.850
Dr. Dessen?

15:33.725 --> 15:34.977
Yeah.

15:35.561 --> 15:37.020
Just one second.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.985
Inside the envelope are three cards.

15:42.985 --> 15:45.279
Choose one and present it
to the woman inside.

15:46.154 --> 15:47.656
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

15:54.997 --> 15:58.208
Hi. Welcome. Have you selected your card?

16:01.545 --> 16:03.755
Do you know where Daniela is?

16:03.755 --> 16:05.048
The artist.

16:05.048 --> 16:08.135
I just know that she's somewhere
back there. Sorry.

16:08.135 --> 16:09.887
Your door is going to be number two.

16:09.887 --> 16:11.763
Please seal the remaining cards
in the envelope

16:11.763 --> 16:14.183
and keep them with you
till the end of the exhibition.

16:14.183 --> 16:15.809
- Yeah.
- Enjoy.

17:53.282 --> 17:54.324
It's you.

17:54.324 --> 17:56.076
I heard you checked in.

17:56.076 --> 17:57.703
Where's Charlie?

17:57.703 --> 17:58.787
Charlie who?

17:59.621 --> 18:02.457
Darling, you've done it.

18:04.710 --> 18:05.836
<i>Listen, The Times</i> is here.

18:05.836 --> 18:09.464
Okay. Good. Sorry.
Alesia, this is Jason Dessen.

18:09.464 --> 18:11.884
Jason, this is Alesia Cheney, my agent.

18:11.884 --> 18:13.719
The Jason that inspired the show?

18:14.344 --> 18:15.345
Yeah.

18:16.930 --> 18:21.435
I am so proud to be your friend.

18:22.227 --> 18:24.980
Hi. This looks fantastic.

18:24.980 --> 18:26.982
Thank you. Look who's here.

18:27.566 --> 18:28.942
Ryan?

18:28.942 --> 18:30.277
Yes. Okay. Going.

18:30.277 --> 18:31.445
Sorry, guys.

18:31.445 --> 18:34.823
I have to go be a good host, but
I'm having a much smaller thing

18:34.823 --> 18:36.783
- at my place after. Will you come?
- Yeah.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.203
- Jason?
- Yeah. I wouldn't miss it.

18:43.498 --> 18:45.375
Well, shit, where the fuck have you been?

18:46.627 --> 18:49.630
I heard you cracked up,
and they stuck you in a cell.

18:52.591 --> 18:55.636
Although I also heard you moved
to Costa Rica and became a farmer.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.014
And I heard you were dead.

18:59.014 --> 19:02.518
Well, I'm certainly not dead, so...

19:04.686 --> 19:09.316
Hey, how did those compounds
I made for you last year work out?

19:10.192 --> 19:12.027
Compounds? What compounds?

19:12.027 --> 19:14.988
All right. Please, I know--

19:15.822 --> 19:18.992
I understand that you're buried
under a mountain of NDAs, Jay,

19:19.785 --> 19:20.744
and I don't wanna be a dick,

19:20.744 --> 19:25.457
but I did a lot of work for you
and Velocity in the dark.

19:25.457 --> 19:26.834
- And--
- Velocity?

19:27.918 --> 19:29.002
You said--

19:29.002 --> 19:32.256
You said Velocity, so you know that place.

19:34.049 --> 19:35.050
What are you doing?

19:35.592 --> 19:38.262
What is this? What is this shit?

19:40.430 --> 19:43.267
- What are you doing?
- Just-- We're not done here.

19:43.767 --> 19:45.936
Hi. Sorry.

19:45.936 --> 19:49.273
Hi, everyone.
If I could just have a moment.

19:49.940 --> 19:52.276
I just wanna say a couple things.

19:52.276 --> 19:55.195
Sometimes,
we ask ourselves the big questions:

19:55.195 --> 19:58.574
"Who am I? Who could I be?

19:58.574 --> 20:02.244
Who might I have been
if the Bulls had defeated the Pistons

20:02.244 --> 20:03.871
in the 1990 conference final?"

20:05.497 --> 20:06.623
Just asking.

20:08.041 --> 20:12.129
We all know our lives are marked
by the choices that we make.

20:13.172 --> 20:16.758
And while I've never been a fan of regret,

20:17.426 --> 20:23.265
I will admit to a certain curiosity
about the path not taken.

20:24.725 --> 20:26.602
Tonight, each of you made a choice

20:26.602 --> 20:29.730
that determined which version
of my show you experienced.

20:29.730 --> 20:32.524
You should still have the cards
that you didn't choose.

20:32.524 --> 20:35.152
They're also tickets
and you can use them to return

20:35.152 --> 20:38.739
at any point during the next month
and take a different path.

20:39.281 --> 20:41.658
Maybe find out
if the grass really is greener.

20:43.327 --> 20:48.165
Thank you to my amazing team.
You made this possible. Thank you.

20:48.165 --> 20:52.169
And thanks to all of you for coming
tonight. It means the world.

20:53.545 --> 20:56.465
- <i>Salud.</i>
- <i>Salud</i>.

21:01.178 --> 21:03.514
And where else is the exhibition showing?

21:03.514 --> 21:06.600
Well, New York and then Boston,

21:06.600 --> 21:08.894
and it'll open in Los Angeles next month.

21:08.894 --> 21:11.772
So probably fly out to go see it.

21:13.690 --> 21:16.818
Well, maybe I'll come with you.

21:18.153 --> 21:20.197
You know, we can make a weekend of it.

21:22.824 --> 21:23.825
Seriously?

21:24.451 --> 21:25.452
Why not?

21:26.912 --> 21:28.205
Well, I would love that.

21:38.006 --> 21:39.174
He called me today.

21:40.259 --> 21:41.260
Ryan did?

21:41.260 --> 21:44.304
Yeah. He wanted to know
if we talked about the job offer.

21:47.432 --> 21:48.433
Food's here.

21:49.434 --> 21:53.272
Can I eat later? Some of my friends
are going to the skate park.

21:53.856 --> 21:54.857
Who's gonna be there?

21:55.649 --> 21:58.652
Brooke, Drew, Adam and Michelle.

21:59.736 --> 22:00.737
Okay.

22:03.323 --> 22:04.992
Sure you don't want to eat
something first, though?

22:04.992 --> 22:07.411
- Yeah, I'm good.
- Okay, back by 10:00.

22:07.411 --> 22:08.871
Yeah. Thanks.

22:11.623 --> 22:13.542
- Hey, kiddo.
- Yeah?

22:15.043 --> 22:16.587
Maybe tonight's the night you tell Brooke.

22:19.423 --> 22:22.301
- Tell her what?
- That he likes her.

22:23.594 --> 22:25.220
Strong disagree.

22:29.433 --> 22:35.022
Well, relationships are a negotiation,

22:35.022 --> 22:38.692
and whoever speaks first kind of loses.

22:39.776 --> 22:43.614
That's a cynical view of love, my love.

22:43.614 --> 22:45.365
Who's talking about love?

22:46.783 --> 22:53.040
Just show her that you're interested,
and-- but play it close to the vest.

22:56.293 --> 22:58.754
So, like, be aloof?

22:58.754 --> 22:59.838
Aloof.

23:00.589 --> 23:02.883
Yeah. The right level of aloof.

23:03.884 --> 23:04.885
But cool.

23:08.722 --> 23:10.390
Have fun. Be yourself.

23:12.184 --> 23:14.645
- Yeah.
- Have fun.

23:15.562 --> 23:17.272
- Yeah, thanks.
- Yeah.

23:21.276 --> 23:22.110
What was that?

23:22.110 --> 23:25.155
What?

23:27.324 --> 23:29.243
Show me aloof. What does aloof look like?

23:31.411 --> 23:32.329
Like...

23:34.873 --> 23:35.874
No.

23:43.465 --> 23:45.092
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:46.260 --> 23:47.261
You want?

24:02.025 --> 24:03.151
So...

24:04.319 --> 24:05.988
now it's just the three of us.

24:07.948 --> 24:08.866
Spill it.

24:10.993 --> 24:11.994
Where you been?

24:27.134 --> 24:28.385
Hypothetical.

24:29.845 --> 24:30.846
Hypothetical?

24:30.846 --> 24:32.306
Oh, boy.

24:36.560 --> 24:41.231
A man of science, physics professor...

24:41.231 --> 24:42.858
- Okay.
- ...he is married

24:42.858 --> 24:47.112
to the woman of his dreams,
and they have a son.

24:47.112 --> 24:48.655
And they all have a good life.

24:49.281 --> 24:53.577
Until one night, this man,
he goes to a bar.

24:55.871 --> 25:00.918
He's seeing an old friend, college buddy,
who's won a prestigious award.

25:02.628 --> 25:05.839
But on the walk home, something happens.

25:07.799 --> 25:09.051
He doesn't make it home.

25:10.594 --> 25:14.097
When he regains his full presence of mind,

25:14.097 --> 25:18.727
everything has changed.

25:21.146 --> 25:22.231
Brain tumor, head trauma?

25:22.231 --> 25:24.233
CT scan says no.

25:24.233 --> 25:27.903
Maybe it's like some kind of
multitiered deepfake punking.

25:27.903 --> 25:33.367
Within five hours, the entire
inside of his house is renovated.

25:33.867 --> 25:35.869
And I'm not just saying
different pictures on the walls.

25:35.869 --> 25:38.664
I'm saying new furniture, new appliances,

25:38.664 --> 25:41.625
light switches have moved,
walls are different colors.

25:41.625 --> 25:44.711
No prank could possibly be this complex.

25:44.711 --> 25:47.047
And, I mean, what would be the point?

25:48.382 --> 25:49.633
How much LSD is this man on?

25:50.300 --> 25:51.844
That seems like a determining factor.

25:51.844 --> 25:56.306
Okay. Then I don't know.
It sounds like he's crazy.

25:57.099 --> 25:58.225
I'm not crazy.

26:14.074 --> 26:17.703
Tonight, your agent said that
I had inspired your installation.

26:19.246 --> 26:21.248
- Yeah.
- How so?

26:22.708 --> 26:24.251
We hadn't seen each other for a while,

26:24.251 --> 26:28.005
and you showed up here
one night out of the blue.

26:28.005 --> 26:31.008
Said you'd been thinking about me.
You really don't remember this?

26:33.135 --> 26:34.261
You told me

26:36.096 --> 26:38.765
that our existence is all about choices.

26:41.977 --> 26:44.271
You said our choices create worlds.

26:46.106 --> 26:47.900
And so, theoretically,

26:48.692 --> 26:52.529
we simultaneously inhabited
an infinite number of them.

26:56.950 --> 26:58.660
You told me that, in this world,

26:59.369 --> 27:02.206
the worst choice you'd made
was the one you made with me.

27:07.252 --> 27:08.378
I said

27:09.213 --> 27:12.549
we'd had our moment all those years ago

27:13.967 --> 27:15.385
and that I loved you.

27:16.094 --> 27:17.763
I'll always love you.

27:17.763 --> 27:21.558
But now we're friends.

27:22.100 --> 27:24.645
I'm in a different place, and you are too.

27:28.398 --> 27:30.150
We talked for a long time.

27:32.361 --> 27:33.820
You started talking about your research,

27:33.820 --> 27:36.490
and you mentioned a project
that was under wraps,

27:37.199 --> 27:40.202
and you said something that struck me,
so I remember it very clearly.

27:41.203 --> 27:45.874
You said you'd probably
never see me again.

27:57.594 --> 27:59.304
When I saw you earlier,

27:59.304 --> 28:01.932
the first thing you asked me was,
"Where's Charlie?"

28:04.476 --> 28:05.519
Who's Charlie?

28:08.772 --> 28:09.815
Our son.

28:15.362 --> 28:17.072
What?

28:17.072 --> 28:18.782
This is what I know.

28:20.909 --> 28:23.328
You and I live in a brownstone

28:23.328 --> 28:24.788
in Logan Square.

28:25.455 --> 28:28.542
We have a 15-year-old son named Charlie.

28:28.542 --> 28:31.753
All right, man. That's not funny.
Why would you even bring that up?

28:31.753 --> 28:32.838
Ryan?

28:36.049 --> 28:38.010
You're a famous neuroscientist.

28:38.010 --> 28:39.887
- I am?
- You won the Pavia.

28:39.887 --> 28:41.722
You lecture all over the world.

28:41.722 --> 28:43.724
This is supremely fucked up.

28:43.724 --> 28:44.808
All over.

28:46.727 --> 28:49.646
You know, Jay, what I think is that

28:50.689 --> 28:52.024
you should eat a bag of dicks.

28:52.024 --> 28:54.193
And please let me
microwave them for you first,

28:54.193 --> 28:56.236
so they're nice and fucking hot
for your mouth.

28:56.236 --> 28:58.363
Fuck you. Honestly, man.

28:58.363 --> 29:00.407
Ryan. Listen, man.

29:00.407 --> 29:02.534
- Ryan! I'm not fucking with you.
- What?

29:02.534 --> 29:05.787
I have not lost my mind. I swear.

29:05.787 --> 29:06.872
I hear you.

29:08.874 --> 29:10.042
There's some stuff I gotta deal with.

29:10.042 --> 29:13.003
- Yeah.
- Do you want him to leave?

29:13.003 --> 29:16.798
- I'm good.
- Yeah? Okay. All right.

29:17.424 --> 29:19.384
You're coming back tomorrow
to finish those dishes, right?

29:22.721 --> 29:24.306
- Hey-- It was a great show.
- I'm good. Yeah.

29:24.306 --> 29:26.058
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Thank you.

29:26.892 --> 29:28.018
I'm sorry.

30:06.515 --> 30:08.225
Why are you using my toothbrush?

30:39.840 --> 30:41.383
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:43.844 --> 30:45.554
You really didn't
need to go to any trouble.

30:45.554 --> 30:47.055
- I could've stayed at a hotel.
- No.

30:47.055 --> 30:50.058
No, you're staying here with me.
End of story.

30:52.561 --> 30:56.481
Your clothes are in the wash.
So I put those there if you want.

30:58.483 --> 30:59.484
Thank you.

31:04.948 --> 31:06.074
Whose are these?

31:07.618 --> 31:09.036
My last boyfriend's.

31:09.828 --> 31:12.539
I really don't know
why I still keep them, but--

31:13.165 --> 31:15.083
- Because they're so fancy.
- Because I do--

31:15.083 --> 31:18.587
Oh, yeah. They're fancy.

31:24.551 --> 31:26.053
When you went to the hospital,

31:27.179 --> 31:28.847
what'd they think was wrong with you?

31:29.556 --> 31:31.308
They don't know.

31:33.268 --> 31:37.564
They said I had some strange drugs
in my system, which I didn't take.

31:40.651 --> 31:42.402
They wanted to have me committed.

31:44.321 --> 31:48.617
Okay. You sure that's not
what's best at this point?

31:48.617 --> 31:54.122
I don't need psychiatric help.
Just need answers.

31:55.499 --> 31:56.500
Yeah.

31:59.920 --> 32:04.341
I know you think that I have lost my mind.

32:08.887 --> 32:10.347
Get some sleep.

33:39.436 --> 33:40.437
Hey.

33:41.855 --> 33:45.025
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

33:45.526 --> 33:46.652
Are you leaving?

33:48.445 --> 33:50.405
Yeah. Training day.

33:50.906 --> 33:51.865
Of course.

33:52.366 --> 33:55.160
Will you take the chicken out of
the freezer and put it in the sink for me?

33:55.160 --> 33:56.745
'Cause it has to defrost.

33:56.745 --> 33:59.456
- Yeah.
- Okay. Thanks. See you.

34:17.266 --> 34:18.559
Have fun.

34:21.937 --> 34:22.938
Thanks.

35:21.121 --> 35:22.831
<i>Sweet buddy. What's up?</i>

35:23.332 --> 35:25.209
- Hey, Ryan.
- <i>Hey.</i>

35:25.209 --> 35:28.962
Daniela said that you called.
You call my wife now?

35:28.962 --> 35:31.632
<i>Yeah, I-- Well, I just thought
she would be super excited.</i>

35:31.632 --> 35:33.509
- All right. Listen, Ryan.
- <i>What?</i>

35:33.509 --> 35:35.969
Just let me be really clear, okay?

35:37.387 --> 35:41.099
I like my life in Chicago,
and I'm not leaving.

35:41.934 --> 35:44.102
So that's a no to the job.

35:45.020 --> 35:46.355
Okay?

35:46.355 --> 35:48.607
- <i>That's a n-- Okay.</i>
- So--

35:49.816 --> 35:52.819
<i>Well, shit, man. I'm sorry I overstepped.</i>

35:52.819 --> 35:55.030
Yeah, well, you kind of fucking did.

35:55.030 --> 35:58.700
<i>Shit, man. Okay.</i>

35:59.284 --> 36:01.286
- Okay.
- <i>Okay, I hear you, man.</i>

36:01.286 --> 36:02.371
Okay.

36:20.931 --> 36:21.765
Hello?

36:22.975 --> 36:23.976
<i>Hi.</i>

36:24.768 --> 36:27.479
Oh, my God. Jason.
Are you okay?

36:29.523 --> 36:30.649
<i>I don't know.</i>

36:35.946 --> 36:36.947
Where are you?

36:38.282 --> 36:43.662
I'm about to walk into
a mental health hospital.

36:44.955 --> 36:47.124
I wish you'd let me help you.

36:48.458 --> 36:51.295
<i>I think I need to see someone
that doesn't know me.</i>

36:57.551 --> 36:58.969
Which hospital?

37:25.120 --> 37:26.788
I'm not sure this is a good idea.

37:28.248 --> 37:30.542
Well, technically, it is my house.

38:04.743 --> 38:05.869
No.

38:13.377 --> 38:14.628
In our house,

38:16.213 --> 38:18.632
we have that photograph of the waterfall.

38:18.632 --> 38:22.761
Only you and me and Charlie are in it.

38:28.141 --> 38:29.476
I've never been there.

38:31.228 --> 38:33.230
We went there five years ago.

38:37.276 --> 38:39.444
It was the trip of a lifetime.

38:57.129 --> 38:59.631
Jason, she sounded worried...

39:00.966 --> 39:02.176
on the phone.

39:03.218 --> 39:04.761
I think we should let her help.

39:05.929 --> 39:08.724
This here is my son's room.

39:09.725 --> 39:11.268
At least it should be.

39:11.935 --> 39:12.936
Our son...

39:15.522 --> 39:16.982
who's into anime.

39:17.649 --> 39:18.859
Skateboarding.

39:19.359 --> 39:21.987
He likes a girl. He's-- You know. Come on.

39:21.987 --> 39:24.907
He draws those crazy landscapes you love.

39:25.782 --> 39:27.951
Fifteen, he's already
looking at art schools,

39:27.951 --> 39:32.706
and you're really proud of him
because he's got your eye for it.

39:33.207 --> 39:34.208
Look...

39:36.293 --> 39:38.629
when I told you that I was pregnant,

39:39.254 --> 39:41.006
you said you needed time
to think about it.

39:41.006 --> 39:42.090
That I remember.

39:42.090 --> 39:44.551
And then, the next day,
you came to my apartment,

39:44.551 --> 39:47.095
and you said that you were busy
with your research.

39:47.095 --> 39:51.308
You said that the next year of your life
would be spent in a clean room

39:51.308 --> 39:53.310
and that I deserved better.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.313
You said our child deserved better.

39:58.148 --> 40:00.234
- No.
- I chose not to do it on my own.

40:00.234 --> 40:02.444
We went our separate ways,
and that's what happened.

40:02.444 --> 40:05.280
That's not what happened.
What happened was, I thought about it,

40:05.280 --> 40:07.699
and I said to you, at the end of my life,

40:07.699 --> 40:11.411
that I would rather have memories of you
than of a cold, sterile lab.

40:12.829 --> 40:16.959
No. You said you weren't ready.

40:18.836 --> 40:20.254
I never said that.

40:24.550 --> 40:26.343
Are you fucking with me?

40:28.053 --> 40:31.348
Or am I walking around a dark house
with someone who's lost his mind?

40:34.768 --> 40:36.436
No, I'm telling you the truth.

40:41.984 --> 40:43.485
We should get out of here.

41:12.055 --> 41:13.056
I'm sorry...

41:17.477 --> 41:19.980
for what you say happened to us.

41:21.648 --> 41:23.233
That was a lifetime ago.

41:23.233 --> 41:25.235
And for all of this. I mean...

41:27.112 --> 41:28.530
I don't want to scare you.

41:28.530 --> 41:32.117
I just don't understand how
what's true for you isn't true for me.

41:33.202 --> 41:35.120
I can't reconcile it, I--

41:38.081 --> 41:42.836
I know I have an entire marriage
worth of memories with you,

41:42.836 --> 41:44.129
which...

41:45.839 --> 41:48.842
I know sounds completely insane.

41:51.386 --> 41:53.388
I just know that I wouldn't lie to you.

41:56.808 --> 41:59.436
I don't know what it means exactly, but...

42:02.856 --> 42:04.024
I believe you.

43:28.984 --> 43:30.360
Holy fuck.

43:31.820 --> 43:33.822
- What?
- He did it.

43:35.324 --> 43:38.952
Son of a-- He did it.

43:41.705 --> 43:42.706
<i>He did what?</i>

43:44.249 --> 43:45.626
<i>What I was trying to do.</i>

43:47.961 --> 43:49.254
Crazy theory.

43:50.172 --> 43:51.048
Crazy.

43:51.048 --> 43:55.928
What if the Jason that lived
in this world-- that won the Pavia Prize,

43:56.595 --> 43:59.723
whose house we were in today,
who everyone thinks that I am--

44:00.766 --> 44:03.060
What if he created

44:03.060 --> 44:05.896
a larger version of my box

44:06.438 --> 44:08.982
that could put not just a particle

44:09.525 --> 44:13.820
but an actual human being
in superposition?

44:19.284 --> 44:24.498
A box that would--
it would allow a person to travel

44:24.498 --> 44:28.252
across the multiple realities
of quantum physics.

44:30.003 --> 44:35.968
<i>And what if he used
that box to travel to my world?</i>

44:42.391 --> 44:43.392
What if...

44:45.269 --> 44:47.437
the person that abducted me...

44:49.147 --> 44:50.148
is me?

44:51.942 --> 44:53.485
How could it be you?

44:53.485 --> 44:57.322
Not exactly me. A version of me.

44:57.322 --> 44:59.283
Like-- All right, imagine

45:00.117 --> 45:03.412
he and I are the same person
all those years ago,

45:03.412 --> 45:05.372
right up until the moment
that you got pregnant.

45:06.790 --> 45:11.837
Then, we split up
into our own separate universes.

45:11.837 --> 45:15.424
We split because I chose to be with you,

45:16.884 --> 45:18.594
and he chose to pursue work,

45:18.594 --> 45:21.054
which led to the creation of the box.

45:38.322 --> 45:40.657
What if, in this moment,

45:41.575 --> 45:42.951
I'm in his world...

45:45.454 --> 45:47.456
<i>and he's in mine?</i>

45:56.840 --> 45:59.259
Why would you do this to yourself, though?

46:25.244 --> 46:27.037
I'm glad you found your way to me.

46:29.248 --> 46:30.249
I am too.

46:36.421 --> 46:37.422
What's this?

46:39.716 --> 46:41.510
That's proof.

46:44.721 --> 46:45.722
Of what?

46:47.057 --> 46:48.642
That I'm not crazy.

46:51.103 --> 46:56.024
See, eventually, the mark
of my wedding ring will disappear,

46:57.150 --> 46:59.528
and my memories will be the only remnant

47:00.821 --> 47:02.948
of this life that I had.

47:05.284 --> 47:08.161
So that's to remind me of what's real

47:08.161 --> 47:11.915
and what I have to get home to.

47:20.465 --> 47:21.925
- Hey.
- Hey.

47:22.467 --> 47:23.468
Still awake?

47:24.428 --> 47:25.429
Yeah.

47:27.431 --> 47:28.640
Do you wanna come down?

47:58.128 --> 47:59.213
Tell me about us.

48:01.006 --> 48:02.132
About us?

48:06.845 --> 48:07.846
Okay.

48:11.600 --> 48:12.976
Where do I start?

48:17.981 --> 48:19.816
We had a shotgun wedding

48:20.317 --> 48:22.402
that pissed a lot of people off.

48:23.862 --> 48:25.656
Then we had an amazing party,

48:26.365 --> 48:27.658
which was great.

48:28.909 --> 48:33.163
And then we became parents
not so long after.

48:34.122 --> 48:38.460
First few years were complicated.

48:38.460 --> 48:40.504
- It got hard. Real hard.
- Why?

48:45.050 --> 48:47.761
You know how it is. Maybe you don't.

48:47.761 --> 48:51.265
But life has a way of just...

48:53.058 --> 48:54.226
grinding you down.

48:55.978 --> 48:56.979
And,

48:58.272 --> 48:59.857
you know, our priorities changed.

48:59.857 --> 49:03.777
I mean, I spent less time in the lab.
You spent less time in the studio.

49:04.945 --> 49:07.322
I eventually lost my funding,

49:07.948 --> 49:10.701
and you eventually quit painting.

49:11.285 --> 49:12.786
I quit painting?

49:14.580 --> 49:15.622
Yeah.

49:17.165 --> 49:20.878
So are we, like, boring?

49:23.839 --> 49:26.008
It's not the way I look at it. It's--

49:26.508 --> 49:28.844
Okay. How do you look at it?

49:31.513 --> 49:33.348
We made a life together.

49:38.937 --> 49:39.771
Am I happy?

49:40.772 --> 49:41.773
Yeah.

49:42.608 --> 49:46.403
We've had our rough patches,
but, yeah. Yeah.

49:48.947 --> 49:52.075
And you are also my best friend.

49:54.828 --> 49:56.205
How's the sex?

50:01.460 --> 50:04.129
Oh, my God. Are you actually blushing?

50:05.464 --> 50:06.757
This is so weird.

50:08.634 --> 50:10.636
- Is it bad?
- No.

50:13.889 --> 50:14.765
No.

50:45.462 --> 50:46.421
I'm sorry.

50:47.005 --> 50:49.174
No.

51:29.631 --> 51:30.632
Hello?

51:32.467 --> 51:33.552
Who is this?

51:38.348 --> 51:39.474
They hung up.

51:55.908 --> 51:58.869
Hey. Listen, please don't.

51:58.869 --> 52:00.913
I'll go with you.
She has nothing to do with it.

52:00.913 --> 52:03.707
Drop the phone. What did I say?

52:03.707 --> 52:06.043
Daniela, do exactly what she says.

52:12.591 --> 52:14.676
No. Daniela.

52:17.137 --> 52:20.474
Daniela. No. Daniela.

52:22.392 --> 52:23.393
No.

52:26.605 --> 52:27.606
Daniela.
