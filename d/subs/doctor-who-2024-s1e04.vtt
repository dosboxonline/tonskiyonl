WEBVTT

00:08.240 --> 00:11.000
[TARDIS whooshes]

00:16.680 --> 00:20.080
Oh, yes! We are in Wales!

00:20.080 --> 00:22.240
- Spectacular!
- What? How can you tell?

00:22.240 --> 00:24.040
Oh! [sniffs]

00:24.040 --> 00:27.600
That smell, that green,
that coastline, Ruby.

00:27.600 --> 00:29.360
- [giggles]
- Oh!

00:29.360 --> 00:31.560
The rocks and the water, it never ends.

00:31.560 --> 00:33.400
The war between the land and the sea.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.240
Oh, you know what?
I've been to Wales twice.

00:35.240 --> 00:38.280
- I went to see Shygirl in Cardiff.
- Oh.

00:38.280 --> 00:41.480
And then I went to Mumbles
when I was about 16 because of a boy.

00:41.480 --> 00:43.840
- I broke his heart, but there you go.
- Oh, bless him.

00:43.840 --> 00:47.160
Mind you, Roger ap Gwilliam,
that's a bad example of the Welsh.

00:47.160 --> 00:48.240
- Terrifying.
- Oh, yeah?

00:48.240 --> 00:50.640
The most dangerous
prime minister in history.

00:50.640 --> 00:54.120
He led the world to the brink of nuclear--

00:55.520 --> 00:57.120
Wait, what year are you from?

00:57.120 --> 00:58.520
2024.

00:58.520 --> 01:01.120
Oh, yikes. Sorry. He was 2046.

01:01.120 --> 01:02.640
[giggles] Sorry, spoilers.

01:02.640 --> 01:05.680
- Forget I said anything.
- No, no, no. Tell me what happened.

01:06.200 --> 01:07.320
[bells tinkle]

01:08.760 --> 01:12.800
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
What is this?

01:12.800 --> 01:14.480
[bells tinkle]

01:14.480 --> 01:17.800
Oh, it's a circle. Someone made this.

01:18.720 --> 01:21.400
I'm sorry, man. I am sorry.

01:22.120 --> 01:25.000
Aw. It looks like something
made by children, doesn't it?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.600
Lucky charms and bird skulls.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.720
Hey, there's little messages. Look.

01:31.800 --> 01:34.840
"I miss you." That's all it says.

01:36.160 --> 01:40.160
[sighs] "Rest in peace, Mad Jack."

01:41.880 --> 01:43.560
[smacks lips] Aw, poor old Mad Jack.

01:43.560 --> 01:47.520
[inhales] Bless him, eh?
Looks like some sort of memorial.

01:49.200 --> 01:51.280
[wind whooshes]

01:51.280 --> 01:54.600
[groans] All right,
don't be doing that to me.

01:56.640 --> 01:58.320
[door rattles]

02:01.800 --> 02:02.880
[key rattles in lock]

02:03.400 --> 02:04.920
Hey, it's locked!

02:05.920 --> 02:07.560
You've locked it from the inside.

02:08.280 --> 02:09.560
Doctor.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.640
I hope you're not having a pee
'round the back.

02:17.480 --> 02:19.440
[smacks lips] Hmm...

02:19.440 --> 02:21.360
[sighs]

02:22.880 --> 02:26.720
[voices whispering]

02:27.440 --> 02:28.600
[inhales deeply]

02:29.200 --> 02:31.840
Hiya. Um, have you seen my friend?

02:31.840 --> 02:35.120
He was here. H-He's just, um--

02:39.880 --> 02:42.120
Can you just w-wait there? J--

02:46.520 --> 02:47.600
Okay.

02:51.360 --> 02:54.800
[sighs] Okay. Okay.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.800
[sighs] Very clever.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.160
Very clever.

03:05.280 --> 03:06.440
[sighs]

03:07.520 --> 03:09.040
Are you a part of this?

03:10.000 --> 03:12.760
What-- What-- What have you done?
Did-- Did you do this?

03:13.560 --> 03:15.040
Where is the Doctor?

03:15.040 --> 03:17.080
Where is he? What have you done to him?

03:26.200 --> 03:27.440
[sighs]

03:32.400 --> 03:33.440
[sighs]

03:45.040 --> 03:47.120
[breathes shakily]

03:59.360 --> 04:00.720
[sighs]

04:03.640 --> 04:05.360
[giggles]

04:26.600 --> 04:27.760
[sighs]

04:32.840 --> 04:34.200
- Hello there.
- Ah. [laughs]

04:34.200 --> 04:37.120
Ooh, you must be mad.
Is that all you're wearing?

04:37.120 --> 04:42.440
Yeah, I got kind of caught.
Um, the-the car broke down.

04:42.440 --> 04:43.760
- [hiker] Oh, no.
- [sighs]

04:43.760 --> 04:44.920
Oh, you poor thing.

04:44.920 --> 04:46.000
I know. What a day.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.960
Um, wh-where is that?

04:47.960 --> 04:49.560
Down there. What is it?

04:49.560 --> 04:53.520
Oh, that's Glyngatwg,
if you'll forgive my pronunciation.

04:53.520 --> 04:54.600
Which they don't.

04:54.600 --> 04:57.200
I-- I haven't met you before, have I?

04:58.040 --> 05:00.160
Well, I don't think so. Have you?

05:01.360 --> 05:03.640
Uh, no, that was a different-- [stammers]

05:03.640 --> 05:05.040
Uh, sorry, could you help me?

05:05.040 --> 05:08.040
That, um, woman over there,
do you see her?

05:08.040 --> 05:10.720
Of course I can. Who is she?

05:10.720 --> 05:14.640
Um, this is gonna sound a bit mad.
[chuckles]

05:14.640 --> 05:16.640
But she's following me.

05:16.640 --> 05:19.400
I think I may have trespassed
or something,

05:19.400 --> 05:21.720
I dunno,
but could you just tell her I'm sorry?

05:22.320 --> 05:23.560
Sorry for what?

05:24.440 --> 05:25.600
Uh, I don't know.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.200
Have I walked into something?

05:28.200 --> 05:29.440
No, no, no, no. Sorry.

05:29.440 --> 05:32.600
You're just going that way,
so could you just tell her that I'm fine?

05:32.600 --> 05:34.160
She can go home. [chuckles]

05:34.160 --> 05:37.440
Well, I'm intrigued now,
and it's no skin off my nose.

05:37.440 --> 05:41.560
But once that's done,
get in the warm, both of you.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.440
Whatever little game this is.

05:44.720 --> 05:48.520
[gasps] Oh, could you
ask her if she knows the Doctor?

05:49.120 --> 05:51.360
Oh, do you need a doctor?

05:51.360 --> 05:53.360
No, but can you just ask?

05:53.360 --> 05:54.760
I'll try.

06:02.360 --> 06:05.400
[speaks indistinctly]

06:10.760 --> 06:14.840
[voices whispering]

06:20.080 --> 06:23.240
- [gasps]
- [hiker screaming]

06:43.920 --> 06:46.440
[footsteps approach]

06:46.440 --> 06:48.280
[sign creaking]

06:54.080 --> 06:56.200
[voices whispering]

06:58.120 --> 06:59.880
[thunder rumbles]

07:06.640 --> 07:08.640
- [breathes shakily]
- [thunder rumbles]

07:09.600 --> 07:11.000
[pants]

07:11.000 --> 07:12.600
[faint TV chatter]

07:14.280 --> 07:15.920
State on you.

07:16.760 --> 07:18.400
Who goes out in this without a coat?

07:20.360 --> 07:23.200
No, I've lost my things.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.560
[sighs] Sorry, it's kind of a long story.

07:26.560 --> 07:28.000
Is it?

07:29.280 --> 07:34.440
Um, I-I-- I don't suppose--
[sighs] I'm a bit stuck.

07:34.440 --> 07:36.760
- Have you got a room for the night?
- I have.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.040
65 quid.

07:39.920 --> 07:43.080
I haven't got anything in for breakfast,
but I can do yoghurt and toast.

07:43.080 --> 07:45.120
Don't let her cook, for God's sake.

07:45.120 --> 07:46.840
- Shut it.
- Don't let her cook.

07:46.840 --> 07:48.120
Uh, no, that's fine.

07:48.120 --> 07:49.160
[chuckles]

07:49.160 --> 07:51.920
I haven't got any cash on me.
C-C-Can I pay on my phone?

07:51.920 --> 07:53.000
Can you what?

07:53.760 --> 07:55.720
Can I pay with my phone?

07:57.200 --> 07:58.560
Pay with your phone?

07:58.560 --> 07:59.800
Yeah.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.640
How do you pay with your phone?

08:02.640 --> 08:04.920
Oh, well,
it's sort of like online banking,

08:04.920 --> 08:08.040
but the phone can transfer money
from my account into--

08:10.240 --> 08:12.560
Yes, you can pay with your phone.

08:14.800 --> 08:17.920
Oh. Sorry. Thank you. [giggles]

08:17.920 --> 08:20.640
We're not quite the Dark Ages, young lady.

08:20.640 --> 08:21.720
Despite what they say.

08:22.440 --> 08:24.960
Well, apparently,
next week we're getting Christianity.

08:24.960 --> 08:26.920
- [patrons laugh]
- Throw 'em to the lions.

08:27.640 --> 08:30.480
Throw them to the lions
and watch them getting eaten alive.

08:30.480 --> 08:33.160
With-With great big teeth
and the blood and things.

08:33.160 --> 08:34.120
Drink?

08:34.800 --> 08:39.720
Yeah, I-- I'll-- I'll have, um--
[sighs] No, I'll just have a Coke.

08:39.720 --> 08:41.600
Last of the big spenders.

08:42.200 --> 08:43.720
[sighs]

08:43.720 --> 08:46.320
- [wind blowing]
- [fire crackling]

08:46.320 --> 08:51.720
'Ey, do-- do you mind if I ask,
that woman out there, can you see her?

08:55.240 --> 08:57.080
Oh, she must be bloody freezing, mun.

08:58.560 --> 08:59.920
Do you know who she is?

08:59.920 --> 09:01.920
I've never seen her. Why? Who is she?

09:01.920 --> 09:03.720
I don't know. [sighs]

09:03.720 --> 09:07.640
I rather think, in this sort of weather,
you should try asking her in.

09:07.640 --> 09:09.640
Oh, no, no. She's-- She's not with me.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.400
She's just following me.

09:13.680 --> 09:14.800
What for?

09:14.800 --> 09:16.040
[Ruby] I don't know.

09:16.600 --> 09:19.000
But she's definitely following you?

09:19.760 --> 09:21.560
Well, yeah, I think so. Yeah.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.400
Five quid.

09:26.480 --> 09:27.480
How much?

09:27.480 --> 09:29.240
- Five quid.
- [sighs]

09:29.920 --> 09:32.160
Pardon me for stating the obvious,

09:32.160 --> 09:36.000
but if there's a woman following you,
have you tried asking her why?

09:39.720 --> 09:41.680
- No.
- Oh, my God!

09:41.680 --> 09:44.040
I'll ask her now. I'm off home for my tea.

09:45.880 --> 09:47.440
I'll send her in for a pie and a pint.

09:47.440 --> 09:50.080
- Hey, you can pay on your magic phone.
- [both laugh]

09:50.080 --> 09:52.200
- All right. Night, girls.
- Night then, Josh.

09:52.200 --> 09:53.360
Safely home.

09:57.160 --> 10:00.640
Um, could you ask her-- [stammers]

10:00.640 --> 10:03.560
There was a friend of mine
in a yellow duffel coat.

10:03.560 --> 10:06.440
Could you just ask her if she's seen him?

10:07.440 --> 10:08.840
Black guy, 5'10''.

10:08.840 --> 10:10.000
Yeah, I'll give it a go.

10:10.680 --> 10:11.600
Cheerio, then.

10:11.600 --> 10:13.200
[owner] See you tomorrow, Josh.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.640
[thunder rumbles]

10:18.360 --> 10:19.440
[sighs]

10:21.680 --> 10:23.320
[sighs]

10:23.320 --> 10:24.880
Following's the wrong word

10:26.160 --> 10:29.240
because she doesn't approach.

10:29.800 --> 10:33.880
She comes so far,
and it's like she stays away,

10:35.400 --> 10:36.680
never comes any closer.

10:39.520 --> 10:43.280
I can't think of a synonym
for keeping your distance.

10:44.000 --> 10:46.720
I suppose to coin a new word,

10:46.720 --> 10:52.000
in Latin, it would be <i>semperdistans</i>,
always distant.

10:52.960 --> 10:55.160
She's <i>semperdistans</i> to you.

10:59.280 --> 11:01.440
[Josh screaming]

11:01.440 --> 11:03.080
Oh, my God. Josh is running.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.640
It's his wife shouting at him.

11:04.640 --> 11:08.520
No, really though. He's running.
He saw that woman, and he ran away.

11:08.520 --> 11:11.440
He ran away like the devil was on his bum.

11:11.440 --> 11:13.840
- [chuckles] What'd she say to him?
- I-I don't know.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.080
- Who is she?
- I don't know!

11:15.080 --> 11:17.440
[older patron]
It seems that Josh is <i>semperdistans</i>.

11:20.480 --> 11:23.800
[Ruby] I wonder-- [sighs] I thought--

11:24.800 --> 11:26.480
See, I was with my friend,

11:27.240 --> 11:31.720
and we walked into this thing
up on the clifftops.

11:31.720 --> 11:35.120
Like, a circle of cotton,

11:35.120 --> 11:40.080
little toy things,
like charms and skulls of birds.

11:40.080 --> 11:44.960
I-- Just, like,
a witchcraft sort of thing.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.640
[TV chatter stops]

11:50.000 --> 11:51.400
What you mean cotton?

11:52.000 --> 11:54.320
Like strands with these things.

11:54.320 --> 11:57.080
Witchcraft is a very strong word.

11:57.080 --> 12:00.840
No, no, no, no. I did not mean witchcraft.
I just meant it's like--

12:00.840 --> 12:02.240
Where was it?

12:02.240 --> 12:04.000
Up on the cliffs, a couple miles that way.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.320
It's what they call a fairy circle.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.040
[laughs] You can ask him about that.

12:08.040 --> 12:09.480
Shut your face.

12:09.480 --> 12:13.840
When you say you walked into it,
did you break it?

12:16.040 --> 12:18.760
Well, it-- [sighs] Yeah.

12:18.760 --> 12:20.800
Uh, no. But it was by mistake.

12:20.800 --> 12:24.040
I mean, it's not magic, is it? [chuckles]

12:24.040 --> 12:25.480
[older patron] Is it not?

12:26.200 --> 12:30.120
The clifftops are a boundary
between the land and the sea.

12:30.720 --> 12:35.280
A liminal space, neither here nor there,
where rules are suspended.

12:37.080 --> 12:38.280
And then there's the blood.

12:40.840 --> 12:42.400
What-- What blood?

12:42.400 --> 12:47.360
Do you know why Wales
has so many picturesque little castles?

12:48.840 --> 12:49.880
No.

12:50.440 --> 12:55.320
They were torture centres set up
by the English to rule with fear.

12:55.320 --> 12:56.760
Steeped in blood, we are.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.160
[young patron] Tons of blood.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.160
[gasps]

12:59.160 --> 13:02.120
This land is a powerful place.

13:02.120 --> 13:05.800
It's said that he walks through the gaps.

13:05.800 --> 13:07.400
The spiteful one.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.280
No, but it was by accident.

13:09.280 --> 13:11.080
My friend-- [sighs]

13:11.080 --> 13:14.480
He would never disrespect a circle
or do anything like that.

13:14.480 --> 13:17.800
And I walked away as soon as
it said "rest in peace".

13:17.800 --> 13:18.880
What did?

13:18.880 --> 13:21.560
The messages. The little scrolls.

13:21.560 --> 13:23.760
- You read them?
- J-Just a couple.

13:23.760 --> 13:25.200
You opened them and read them?

13:25.200 --> 13:26.360
Why did you do that?

13:26.360 --> 13:28.160
Well, they were there!

13:28.160 --> 13:32.600
I think whatever spell was cast
in this circle is now broken.

13:33.200 --> 13:34.320
What else did they say?

13:34.320 --> 13:35.960
- It was just, um--
- What else did they say?

13:35.960 --> 13:38.000
O-One said, "Rest in peace."

13:39.000 --> 13:41.240
-"Rest in peace, Mad Jack."
- [both gasp]

13:41.240 --> 13:43.840
- [thunderclaps]
- Oh, my God.

13:43.840 --> 13:47.200
I think, perhaps, that wasn't wise.

13:47.200 --> 13:49.720
No, I-I just thought it was someone's dog
or something.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.960
[scoffs] Say that to Mad Jack's face.

13:51.960 --> 13:53.960
- [Ruby] Why? Who was he?
- He was insane.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.240
And he's dead!

13:55.240 --> 13:56.960
But now she's broken the circle.

13:56.960 --> 13:58.120
Yeah, but what does that mean?

13:58.120 --> 14:00.040
[older patron] The charm was very clear.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.880
Binding his soul to rest in peace.

14:03.880 --> 14:06.320
<i>Semperdistans</i> to keep him away.

14:06.320 --> 14:08.560
But now you've broken it.

14:09.880 --> 14:12.960
And if that woman outside is his herald,

14:13.760 --> 14:18.360
that means Mad Jack is unbound.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.280
- [pounding at door]
- Oh, don't. [breathes heavily]

14:22.280 --> 14:25.160
He'd kill me. He would kill me!

14:25.160 --> 14:27.360
I'm the one he'd kill first,
and you know why, don't you?

14:27.360 --> 14:29.000
What the hell have you done?

14:29.000 --> 14:32.160
- No, that's just someone at the door.
- [pounding continues]

14:32.160 --> 14:35.440
No, no, no. But he'd go home!
He wouldn't have come here. He'd go home!

14:35.440 --> 14:38.560
There's no home to go to, you idiot.
Not anymore.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.120
He drank in this pub.

14:40.880 --> 14:42.360
He called this place home.

14:42.360 --> 14:44.160
That is not Mad Jack out there!

14:44.160 --> 14:45.840
Then answer the door.

14:45.840 --> 14:48.520
- [thunderclaps]
- [pounding on door]

14:50.000 --> 14:52.880
- [slow pounding]
- [owner] It's him. It's him.

14:52.880 --> 14:54.760
Oh, my God. It's him.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.600
Hurry up. I've got my hands full.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.280
[patrons laughing]

14:59.280 --> 15:01.280
You've got enough pasties here
to last two weeks!

15:01.280 --> 15:02.520
[laughing continues]

15:02.520 --> 15:04.320
Get 'em in the freezer fast.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.480
- [laughing continues]
- What's so funny?

15:06.480 --> 15:08.360
Her face! Oh, my God, her face.

15:08.360 --> 15:10.800
- [all laughing]
- [young patron] Best one yet, that was.

15:10.800 --> 15:12.360
His herald, I loved that bit.

15:13.200 --> 15:16.160
It's racist, my dear, to be blunt.

15:16.160 --> 15:19.160
People come from outside,
they think we're all witches and druids.

15:19.160 --> 15:23.000
For God's sake, child,
you walked into a piece of string.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.400
Can I stand you a pint, Eddie?

15:25.400 --> 15:27.040
Don't mind if I do.

15:28.320 --> 15:30.800
[laughing continues]

15:32.320 --> 15:35.600
- [laughs echoing]
- [thunder rumbles]

15:36.600 --> 15:38.280
[birds tweeting]

15:47.680 --> 15:48.880
[spoon clinks]

15:53.640 --> 15:55.200
Got those spare.

15:56.080 --> 15:57.680
I'll have them back, mind.

15:59.600 --> 16:00.600
[sighs]

16:04.080 --> 16:05.440
[sighs]

16:12.840 --> 16:14.160
[whoosh]

16:14.920 --> 16:15.920
I said to Josh--

16:15.920 --> 16:18.560
I said, "We haven't seen you."
He said, "I'm never coming back."

16:18.560 --> 16:21.920
I said, "Why?" And he said, "Ask her."
So, I'm asking you, why?

16:22.680 --> 16:25.960
I think he meant ask her.

16:29.080 --> 16:34.680
Well, I made it very clear to Josh
you will be packing and going.

16:35.920 --> 16:38.200
And we won't see you again as of today.

16:38.760 --> 16:40.160
Is that understood?

16:54.840 --> 16:56.920
Look, maybe I should just go home.

16:57.960 --> 17:00.560
I haven't even known you
for that long anyway, but--

17:01.560 --> 17:04.120
You know, maybe t-this--
this is what you do.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.040
[sighs]

17:07.960 --> 17:11.400
But if you come back... [chuckles]

17:12.280 --> 17:14.960
...I would love to see you again.

17:16.040 --> 17:18.720
God, I-I-I'd just absolutely love it.

17:21.560 --> 17:23.160
[whispers] Okay.

17:25.120 --> 17:26.520
Bye-bye. [chuckles]

17:29.000 --> 17:30.320
[sighs]

17:30.960 --> 17:32.720
I'm going now!

17:33.600 --> 17:35.320
Okay?

17:35.320 --> 17:37.200
You win!

17:39.440 --> 17:40.440
[sighs]

17:43.920 --> 17:46.680
[train announcer]
<i>This is the Great Western Railway service</i>

17:46.680 --> 17:48.040
<i>to London Paddington.</i>

18:00.960 --> 18:03.640
[reggae music playing]

18:03.640 --> 18:06.320
- [sighs, laughs]
- Here she is, here she is, here she is.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.880
- All safe and sound. [sighs]
- Love you.

18:08.880 --> 18:09.960
She's back!

18:09.960 --> 18:14.520
I told her that man was no good
with his box of magic tricks!

18:15.240 --> 18:17.440
Some kind of <i>guzum</i>.

18:17.440 --> 18:20.040
Maybe the Doctor went inside his box and--

18:20.720 --> 18:21.880
That's what men do.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.720
They go into their sheds and they potter.

18:25.480 --> 18:29.560
They have train sets and hobbies,
and things women should never know about.

18:30.280 --> 18:31.720
I mean, I don't know.

18:31.720 --> 18:34.760
I've never had a garden. Never had a shed.

18:34.760 --> 18:35.920
I've never had a man.

18:35.920 --> 18:37.400
But that's what they say.

18:37.400 --> 18:41.040
And your intergalactic nutcase is doing it
on a cosmic scale.

18:41.600 --> 18:45.800
But he's still, essentially,
inside his shed pottering.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.640
He must be!

18:47.640 --> 18:49.080
[kettle boiling]

18:49.080 --> 18:52.000
Look, I-I didn't tell you everything.

18:55.520 --> 18:57.040
There's this woman. [sighs]

19:01.280 --> 19:02.720
This is what we'll do!

19:03.280 --> 19:06.480
If I can approach her,
then I'll phone you.

19:07.040 --> 19:08.480
I'll walk up to her like this.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.520
- Hello?
- [phone rings]

19:12.440 --> 19:14.520
- Hi.
- Then I can talk to her.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.680
- Then you can hear what she's got to say.
- No, I've told you.

19:16.680 --> 19:18.920
Everyone she talks to, they just run away.

19:18.920 --> 19:21.200
Yes, but Welsh people.

19:21.960 --> 19:24.680
Trust me, darling. It's a plan.

19:24.680 --> 19:27.480
All right. Well, just be careful! Okay.

19:28.160 --> 19:30.080
Having a nice time?

19:30.080 --> 19:32.480
Yeah, I'm just speaking to...

19:32.480 --> 19:37.120
You're standing in the street
on the phone to your own mother?

19:37.720 --> 19:38.880
[stammers] Yeah.

19:41.520 --> 19:42.880
Nothing to do with me.

19:46.120 --> 19:47.960
Mum, what does she look like?

19:48.520 --> 19:50.640
[Carla]
<i>She looks like what she looks like.</i>

19:51.840 --> 19:52.840
What does that mean?

19:53.920 --> 19:55.720
<i>She looks like what she is.</i>

19:56.480 --> 19:59.160
Mum, what's she saying?
I can't-- [sighs] I can't quite hear.

19:59.720 --> 20:01.880
- [static crackles on phone]
- What's she saying?

20:01.880 --> 20:03.320
Mum?

20:03.320 --> 20:06.720
Mum, whatever she's saying
just don't-- No, Mum!

20:06.720 --> 20:08.320
Mum, don't listen to her!

20:08.320 --> 20:10.520
- Please, don't do this to me. Mum!
- [screams]

20:10.520 --> 20:12.960
- Mum, don't do this to me. Mum!
- [Carla screaming]

20:12.960 --> 20:14.040
Mum!

20:15.720 --> 20:17.520
Mum, please! Just stop!

20:18.520 --> 20:21.240
Mum? [pants]

20:40.160 --> 20:43.200
[low whirring]

20:44.400 --> 20:47.400
[distorted] Mum! Mum, please!

20:49.360 --> 20:53.520
[sobbing]

20:57.720 --> 21:00.240
[sobbing]

21:06.320 --> 21:09.400
She run away? What did you say to her?

21:09.400 --> 21:11.760
What? It wasn't me. It was the woman.

21:11.760 --> 21:12.840
Mum, phone me back.

21:12.840 --> 21:16.160
Just-- [huffs] Just tell me what she said.
Just talk to me, okay?

21:16.160 --> 21:17.760
Just please phone me back.

21:17.760 --> 21:19.640
Look, I don't care
if you're on answerphone.

21:19.640 --> 21:22.080
[scoffs] I will keep calling
a hundred times a day.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.640
And you've got to come home.

21:23.640 --> 21:26.400
Come on, Mum.
Gran is calling you everything.

21:26.400 --> 21:30.560
...and if you do come home,
I'll make that shepherd's pie, yeah?

21:30.560 --> 21:33.120
The one we saw on <i>Saturday Kitchen</i>
with the cheese,

21:33.120 --> 21:35.480
and we can sit down
and just pretend that--

21:36.400 --> 21:37.400
Hang on.

21:38.560 --> 21:39.920
[sighs]

21:39.920 --> 21:41.000
[door rattles]

21:41.800 --> 21:43.080
Oh, no, you did not.

21:44.280 --> 21:47.320
Mum! Mum, can you hear me?

21:48.000 --> 21:51.080
Gran? Gran, are you in there?

21:51.080 --> 21:53.560
Come on. You can't change the locks on me!
Come on!

21:53.560 --> 21:55.120
[echoing] <i>Mum!</i>

21:56.120 --> 21:58.640
[Carla] <i>I won't ask you again, Ruby.</i>

21:59.600 --> 22:02.600
<i>Please stop calling and go away.</i>

22:03.640 --> 22:05.120
But I'm your daughter.

22:05.680 --> 22:08.600
Well, except you're not.

22:09.120 --> 22:10.200
Are you?

22:11.040 --> 22:13.240
Even your real mother didn't want you.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.360
I take it that's the woman behind me,
is that right?

22:52.400 --> 22:53.880
- Yes. [sighs]
- Good.

22:53.880 --> 22:55.600
Well, just look at me instead.

22:56.160 --> 22:59.320
I'm Kate Lethbridge-Stewart,
and I think I can help.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.000
[sighs]

23:01.920 --> 23:03.600
[Ruby] Yeah, and that was over a year ago.

23:03.600 --> 23:06.760
She's put an injunction out against me,
my own mother.

23:06.760 --> 23:08.280
I thought about going back to Manchester,

23:08.280 --> 23:11.960
but I don't want to leave, you know,
just in case.

23:11.960 --> 23:14.280
And I've got this rubbish job
at Kleinermann's to make ends meet.

23:14.280 --> 23:16.680
- [chuckles]
- Well, I think we can help with that.

23:16.680 --> 23:19.760
We have a tradition of helping
the Doctor's former companions

23:19.760 --> 23:23.040
once they return to a normal life.

23:23.040 --> 23:25.360
No, I-I was hardly with him really.

23:25.360 --> 23:28.480
- But it felt like a lifetime?
- Yeah.

23:28.480 --> 23:31.040
Well, we're
the Unified Intelligence Taskforce

23:31.040 --> 23:33.200
created to investigate
the extraterrestrial.

23:33.200 --> 23:35.800
And, more and more, the supernatural.

23:36.520 --> 23:38.800
Things seem to be turning that way
these days.

23:39.480 --> 23:41.080
And you work with the Doctor?

23:41.080 --> 23:44.080
With him, despite him,
against him sometimes.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.160
And I adore him.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.320
[chuckles]

23:46.320 --> 23:48.400
I can only say that now he's not here.

23:48.400 --> 23:50.400
Oh, no, I-- I won't say a word.

23:50.400 --> 23:52.240
I wish you'd got in touch with us sooner.

23:52.240 --> 23:54.720
We thought the Doctor was-- was silent.

23:54.720 --> 23:57.640
Oh, I know. I keep wondering
how the world survives without him.

23:57.640 --> 23:59.160
Well, that's classified.

23:59.160 --> 24:01.120
I think I can say, skin of our teeth.

24:01.800 --> 24:05.920
Although, I think this timeline
might be suspended along your event.

24:06.600 --> 24:09.360
- I'm glad we found you.
- Oh, my-- [sighs] So am I. [chuckles]

24:09.360 --> 24:11.040
And you can take us to the TARDIS?

24:11.040 --> 24:13.560
Yeah, it's just sitting there.

24:13.560 --> 24:15.720
I'm actually surprised
no one's reported it, really.

24:15.720 --> 24:16.960
It has a perception filter.

24:16.960 --> 24:19.200
People notice it,
but sort of-- sort of don't.

24:19.200 --> 24:20.280
Mmm.

24:20.280 --> 24:22.320
[stammers] I wonder if it's connected.

24:22.320 --> 24:26.720
If-- If landing a perception filter
on top of that circle has affected things.

24:26.720 --> 24:27.920
Huh.

24:29.560 --> 24:32.520
Well, maybe.
'Cause she-- she has a perception thing.

24:33.280 --> 24:35.240
- Huh.
- Like, no one at work has complained

24:35.240 --> 24:37.440
about the old woman stood outside
every day.

24:37.440 --> 24:39.840
It's like they see her,
but they don't notice her.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.400
'Ey, I once positioned her
right in front of a police car,

24:42.400 --> 24:43.600
and they drove right around her.

24:43.600 --> 24:45.280
And if you sit in a room with no windows?

24:45.280 --> 24:48.000
No, I can't see her.
But I know she's there.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.040
Seventy-three yards.
I have measured it a hundred times.

24:51.040 --> 24:53.680
I have measured it a thousand times.
It's 73 yards.

24:53.680 --> 24:55.720
- But if you went on a plane?
- Or a boat.

24:55.720 --> 24:57.280
Yeah, I know, I know. [inhales]

24:57.280 --> 24:58.600
But I don't. [sighs]

24:58.600 --> 25:04.520
'Cause I keep thinking if I cut her off,
I might die

25:05.840 --> 25:06.840
or she might die.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.920
I-- I don't know. Does that sound mad?
[chuckles]

25:09.880 --> 25:12.000
- Sounds wise.
- Mm-hmm.

25:12.000 --> 25:13.640
It's what we do, all of us.

25:13.640 --> 25:18.680
We see something inexplicable
and invent the rules to make it work.

25:18.680 --> 25:21.000
Mankind saw the sunrise and created God.

25:21.000 --> 25:24.120
Or we saw the arrival of a Sontaran,
one or the other.

25:24.120 --> 25:25.680
- [Ruby chuckles]
- [phone dings]

25:27.840 --> 25:31.360
And I can confirm.
Our scan says 73 yards exactly.

25:31.360 --> 25:33.560
I hope you don't mind.
I didn't come alone.

25:38.720 --> 25:40.280

Yes, but the point is that

it's the cost of living, it's inflation,

31:01.480 --> 31:04.680

31:04.680 --> 31:07.360

I-I was born in Wales.

It's not one of those apps that you used
to have on your phones in the old days.

It means "son of".

31:24.600 --> 31:26.600
I am a son of Wales.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.880
And the Welsh know
what it's like to be oppressed.

31:28.880 --> 31:31.040
And that has taught me to say, "No more."

31:31.680 --> 31:33.480
And that's what I am saying. No more.

31:33.480 --> 31:35.400

That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

38:34.760 --> 38:35.920
[Roger screams]

38:36.680 --> 38:39.520
- [chuckling, exhales heavily]
- [security] Sir! Sir!

38:39.520 --> 38:41.000
[security clamours, shouting]

38:41.000 --> 38:44.560
[Ruby sighs, laughs]

38:51.920 --> 38:53.400
[sighs]

38:56.840 --> 38:58.560
[newscaster] <i>And fifty minutes later,</i>

38:58.560 --> 39:02.160
Roger ap Gwilliam resigned
from the office of prime minister,

39:02.160 --> 39:05.200
refusing to give any reasons
for his actions.

39:05.200 --> 39:07.840
- [reporter 1] What happened?
- [reporter 2] Why did you resign?

39:07.840 --> 39:08.920
Ask her.

39:09.520 --> 39:10.880
- Ask her.
- [shutter clicking]

39:10.880 --> 39:11.960
Ask her!

39:11.960 --> 39:16.760
<i>The deputy prime minister, Iris Cabriola,
has stepped forward to take control</i>

39:16.760 --> 39:21.920
<i>and has already promised what she calls
a more lenient and listening government.</i>

39:26.200 --> 39:27.240
[sighs]

39:31.000 --> 39:32.160
Is that it?

39:34.480 --> 39:36.160
'Ey, is that what you were for?

39:42.640 --> 39:44.800
[whispers] Can you leave me alone now?

39:46.600 --> 39:47.640
[sighs]

39:54.080 --> 39:55.200
[seagull cries]

39:59.600 --> 40:00.600
[door shuts]

40:00.600 --> 40:03.800
I'm sorry, Ruby. I can't drive any closer.

40:03.800 --> 40:06.280
I can't get a signal for the engine
this far out.

40:06.280 --> 40:08.600
No, it's fine.

40:10.360 --> 40:14.040
I haven't been here in such a long time.

40:14.960 --> 40:17.160
What a beautiful view.

40:28.400 --> 40:29.400
[bells tinkle]

40:34.000 --> 40:35.960
Why do people put flowers here?

40:36.760 --> 40:38.680
I don't think they know.

40:51.280 --> 40:55.320
I presume she must be gone, my mother.

40:56.240 --> 40:58.200
No one ever told me.

40:59.600 --> 41:02.640
And I didn't find my birth mother.

41:04.680 --> 41:07.920
It never snowed again.

41:12.640 --> 41:17.280
But I keep thinking I know why.

41:18.320 --> 41:19.680
The woman.

41:20.840 --> 41:24.520
And I've been thinking about it
my whole life.

41:25.720 --> 41:27.280
Why is she here?

41:29.160 --> 41:34.200
And I think, at the end, I have hope.

41:35.800 --> 41:42.200
Because that's very you,
isn't it, my old friend?

41:44.000 --> 41:46.560
I dare to hope.

41:50.480 --> 41:53.320
- [monitor beeping]
- [nurse] I've set the light, Ruby.

41:53.920 --> 41:59.320
If you wake up in the night, you say
"light" out loud, and it comes on.

42:00.560 --> 42:04.000
Yes, I know. That's not new.

42:04.840 --> 42:07.280
We had that when I was young.

42:08.880 --> 42:10.520
Anything else you need?

42:12.880 --> 42:17.080
I could make it snow once upon a time.

42:17.880 --> 42:19.240
That's nice.

42:20.800 --> 42:23.640
If you need me, I'm just down the hall.

42:24.320 --> 42:26.120
So, you won't be on your own.

42:28.000 --> 42:33.080
Don't worry.
Everyone has abandoned me my whole life...

42:36.240 --> 42:40.640
but I haven't been alone for 65 years.

42:41.640 --> 42:43.320
[nurse] Night then, Ruby.

42:44.080 --> 42:45.800
- Light off.
- [beeps]

42:46.320 --> 42:48.440
- [door closes]
- [monitor beeping continues]

42:52.800 --> 42:55.960
[voices whispering]

42:58.480 --> 42:59.880
Light.

43:00.720 --> 43:02.960
[breathes heavily]

43:04.200 --> 43:05.480
[voices whispering]

43:12.640 --> 43:14.240
[heart thumping]

43:14.240 --> 43:15.320
[beeping continues]

43:25.520 --> 43:27.280
[heartbeat slows]

43:32.600 --> 43:33.960
[rapid beeping]

43:37.960 --> 43:39.240
[flat tone]

43:39.240 --> 43:42.440
[chatter, laughs]

43:43.440 --> 43:48.840
[Old Ruby] I'm sorry I took so long,
and I tried so hard.

43:49.640 --> 43:51.320
What else could I do?

43:52.280 --> 43:55.160
It took all these years.

43:55.160 --> 43:57.920
All these long years.

43:58.920 --> 44:01.960
And look at me, I was so young.

44:01.960 --> 44:04.280
[Doctor] Spectacular! We are in Wales!

44:04.280 --> 44:06.240
- [Ruby] What? How can you tell?
- Oh! [sniffs]

44:06.240 --> 44:10.000
That smell, that green,
that coastline, Ruby.

44:10.000 --> 44:13.160
- [giggles]
- The rock and the water, it never ends.

44:13.160 --> 44:15.280
The war between the land and the sea.

44:15.280 --> 44:18.320
'Ey, you know what?
I have been to Wales three times now.

44:18.320 --> 44:21.080
- I went to see Shygirl in Cardiff.
- Oh, yeah?

44:21.080 --> 44:22.760
And then went to Mumbles because of a boy.

44:22.760 --> 44:24.920
- I broke his heart, but there you go.
- Oh, bless him.

44:24.920 --> 44:28.600
Mind you, Roger ap Gwilliam,
that's a bad example of the Welsh.

44:28.600 --> 44:30.280
- Terrifying.
- [Old Ruby] <i>Don't step...</i>

44:30.280 --> 44:32.200
[Doctor] The most dangerous
prime minister in history.

44:32.200 --> 44:33.600
- Who's she?
- [Old Ruby] <i>Don't step...</i>

44:33.600 --> 44:35.600
- [Doctor] Who?
- Well, over there.

44:35.600 --> 44:36.920
[Old Ruby] <i>Don't step...</i>

44:36.920 --> 44:39.000
- Where?
- [Old Ruby] <i>Don't step...</i>

44:40.560 --> 44:41.800
There was a woman...

44:45.520 --> 44:47.320
Well, she's not there anymore. [chuckles]

44:47.320 --> 44:49.840
But there was. There was a woman.
She was just standing there.

44:50.360 --> 44:52.280
Maybe she was looking for someone.

44:53.600 --> 44:55.080
All right, Ruby. All right.

44:55.080 --> 44:57.520
- [bells tinkle]
- [Ruby] Oh, no, no, no. Don't step.

44:59.280 --> 45:02.360
Oh.

45:02.920 --> 45:04.640
I almost broke that.

45:05.160 --> 45:06.280
Careful.

45:07.560 --> 45:10.080
Oh, honey, what a beautiful thing.

45:11.000 --> 45:14.200
- What is it?
- It's a-- It's a fairy circle.

45:15.120 --> 45:16.960
Man, they are so delicate.

45:17.560 --> 45:22.400
Just charms and spells
and hopes and dreams.

45:23.080 --> 45:24.760
It's here at the end of the land.

45:25.360 --> 45:27.720
- Well, yeah. What do they say?
- No, no, no, no. Better not.

45:28.240 --> 45:30.960
[sighs] Give them their respect, Ruby.

45:30.960 --> 45:32.480
Let them rest in peace.

45:33.080 --> 45:35.880
- Like your mysterious woman.
- [chuckles] Oh, she was there.

45:35.880 --> 45:38.120
Uh-huh. [chuckles]

45:38.120 --> 45:40.760
And we are here!

45:40.760 --> 45:43.200
[both laugh]

45:44.560 --> 45:47.440
So, what was the third time
that you've been to Wales?

45:47.440 --> 45:49.880
You said you've been three times.
What was the other one?

45:50.400 --> 45:54.320
Oh, um, oh, I don't know. When was it?
I can't think.

45:54.320 --> 45:57.520
I suppose it must've been... [sighs]

45:59.840 --> 46:01.120
...now.

46:02.320 --> 46:05.360
[theme song plays]

46:05.360 --> 46:07.680
[weatherman] <i>It's a glorious day
in Finetime.</i>

46:07.680 --> 46:09.880
There are creatures out there
in the real world.

46:09.880 --> 46:11.400
<i>There are monsters...</i>

46:11.400 --> 46:12.920
- [screams]
- <i>...and they're coming to get you.</i>

46:12.920 --> 46:16.680
[victim] <i>Just look at my Close Friends.
Look how many are missing.</i>

46:16.680 --> 46:19.120
- <i>God, it's me! They're coming for me!</i>
- [computer] <i>Forward. Forward.</i>

46:19.120 --> 46:21.200
[song continues]
