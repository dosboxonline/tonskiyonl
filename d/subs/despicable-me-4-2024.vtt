12:11.356 --> 12:12.925
Oh, no. You're gonna love it.

12:13.061 --> 12:15.257

12:15.392 --> 12:18.660

and it's fantastic
and we're going.

and Uncle Dru?

I'm sorry. No one can know
of your whereabouts,

For your own safety,
you'll all be assuming

New identities?
Is that really necessary?

16:48.138 --> 16:50.038

because you knew

totally rock at this?

Yes, I didn't want
to frighten the girls,

but it is absolutely crucial
you keep your true identities
under wraps.

to not be so "Gru-ish."

17:56.535 --> 17:58.565
What is that supposed to mean?

Well, I'm just saying
you tend to stand out
in a crowd, that's all.

cranky and irritable.

And how you make things
a bit awkward
for everyone around you.

18:10.046 --> 18:12.589
You do do that. [chuckles]
I mean, you know--

18:12.724 --> 18:14.125
Okay, enough.

18:14.260 --> 18:16.924
I don't make people
awkward or uncomfortable.

who are making it awkward.

in Mayflower,

22:35.254 --> 22:37.515
and I say
we make it a great one.

22:37.651 --> 22:39.323
Right, Chet Jr?
[giggles]

22:39.459 --> 22:42.423
Whoo-hoo, Mayflower. Yes!
Whoo-hoo. [chuckles]

22:42.558 --> 22:44.494
We're gonna be late for karate.

22:44.629 --> 22:46.230
And you have to
get Margo to school.
Ah.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.629
It's gonna be awesome.
Ugh. Yay.

22:48.765 --> 22:51.226
Hey, you just have to
put yourself out there,

22:51.361 --> 22:55.033
and I promise Mayflower
will love Chet Cunningham.

22:55.168 --> 22:58.072
Well, they're gonna love him
just as much as I do.

22:58.207 --> 23:02.570
And you, little man,
are gonna have so much fun
with your daddy today.

23:02.705 --> 23:03.672
[babbles]

23:03.808 --> 23:06.642
Yep, just you and Dada.

23:06.777 --> 23:08.784
Come on, say it. Dada.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.454
Dada.

23:12.387 --> 23:14.287
[blows raspberry]

23:14.422 --> 23:16.427
Gonna be a fun day.

23:20.791 --> 23:23.225

Hup, hup, hup!

23:30.636 --> 23:32.839
Hup, hup, hup, hup!

23:34.209 --> 23:35.041

23:35.177 --> 23:36.737
Okay.

[exclaims, giggles]

23:41.519 --> 23:43.385
Thanks a lot, guys.
Ah, ha-ha, buddy.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.951

...check ya.

23:46.584 --> 23:47.881
[giggles]

23:48.017 --> 23:50.420
All right. Thanks, hon.

23:50.556 --> 23:51.891
Bye.
Bye.

23:52.725 --> 23:54.731
Look, Margo, neighbors.

23:54.867 --> 23:55.996
Hello!

23:56.131 --> 23:57.426
Hmm?

23:57.562 --> 23:58.661
Come on.

23:58.796 --> 24:00.396
You got this, Chet.

24:00.532 --> 24:02.196
[groans]

24:02.332 --> 24:05.371
I'm your new neighbor,
Chet Cunningham.

24:05.507 --> 24:07.269
Uh-huh. Perry Prescott.

24:07.404 --> 24:11.507
So, what, uh, brings you
to the neighborhood, Chet?

24:11.643 --> 24:14.277
Well, uh...

24:14.413 --> 24:18.817
[gasps] Solar panels. That's it.
I sell solar panels.

24:18.952 --> 24:21.583
Have you joined
the solar revolution?

24:21.718 --> 24:23.324
Yeah, no.

24:23.459 --> 24:25.258
Uh, I think I'm good.

24:25.393 --> 24:26.426
Good to know.

24:26.562 --> 24:28.263
So, what do you do, Perry?

24:28.398 --> 24:30.367
I own Prescott Motors.

24:30.502 --> 24:33.928
The largest auto dealer
in the state.

24:34.064 --> 24:36.667
Wow, that's impressive.

24:36.803 --> 24:38.732
This is my daughter Margo.

24:38.867 --> 24:39.803
Bree, Dad.

24:39.938 --> 24:43.644
Ah, yes. Yes. Did I say "Margo"?

24:43.780 --> 24:45.642
It's funny,
because I was thinking--

24:45.777 --> 24:49.451
I was thinking about a fish
I once had as a pet,
named Margo.

24:49.587 --> 24:53.788
Who lived in the pond
and then died.

24:54.651 --> 24:55.618
Uh.

24:55.753 --> 24:58.453
Anyway, I, uh--

24:58.588 --> 25:02.126
I'm about to take Bree
to school for her first day.

25:02.261 --> 25:05.035
Yeah, I was about to take Poppy
to school, so...

25:05.170 --> 25:07.501
Poppy. Hello, Poppy.

25:07.637 --> 25:09.634
That's a fun name to say.

25:09.770 --> 25:11.366
You want to carpool with us?

25:11.943 --> 25:12.902
No.

25:13.038 --> 25:15.010
You could be friends
with Bree.

25:15.146 --> 25:16.170
Right, Bree?

25:16.305 --> 25:18.472
You don't have any friends.

25:19.116 --> 25:21.047
[chuckles]

25:21.182 --> 25:24.315
Well, love to chitchat, Chet,
but she's got school,

25:24.451 --> 25:27.250
and I'm meeting some pals
over at the country club, so...

25:27.385 --> 25:29.356
Ooh, country club.
That sounds like a lot of fun.

25:29.491 --> 25:35.566
If I were ever invited
to a country club,
I am sure that I would love it.

25:37.135 --> 25:40.799
Yeah, well,
we really have to get going,
so nice meeting you, Chet.

25:40.934 --> 25:42.830
["I'm Too Sexy" plays on stereo]

25:42.966 --> 25:48.276
Okay, cool.
Any time you want to hang out,
just hit me up with a text.

25:48.412 --> 25:50.079
He's gonna text me.

25:50.215 --> 25:51.714
That was painful.

25:56.785 --> 25:58.415
You'll see. By lunchtime,

25:58.551 --> 26:02.192
you will have forgotten
all about
your old, lousy friends.

26:02.328 --> 26:04.562
Mmm, not so sure about that.

26:09.230 --> 26:11.761
[students chattering, giggling]
Right? Oh, my gosh.

26:11.896 --> 26:13.063
Not my problem, bro.

26:13.198 --> 26:16.699
[sighs]
Hey, honey,
you got this.

26:16.835 --> 26:17.799
You're smart.

26:17.935 --> 26:19.135
You're funny.

26:19.271 --> 26:20.936
What's there
to worry about, right?

26:21.072 --> 26:23.438
They're gonna love you.

26:24.578 --> 26:25.847
Thanks, Gru.

26:27.912 --> 26:29.279
[Gru] Bye-bye.

26:30.851 --> 26:33.615
Oh, please let them love you.

26:33.751 --> 26:34.823
[sighs]

26:35.785 --> 26:36.825
Ooh!

26:38.328 --> 26:40.290
Hey, Poppy.

Come on. Hey. Move it!

26:50.269 --> 26:53.439
Sorry. My bad.
I'm going. All right.

26:53.574 --> 26:54.909
I'm going.

27:26.278 --> 27:27.403
All right, gentlemen.

27:27.970 --> 27:29.009
Fall in.

27:30.981 --> 27:33.478
Some of you may be wondering
why you're here.

27:33.614 --> 27:34.846
Uh,<i> sí.</i>

27:34.981 --> 27:36.850
As you may or may not know,

27:36.985 --> 27:38.779
I was recently
called out of retirement

27:38.914 --> 27:41.490
to head up the AVL's
new top-secret initiative

27:41.625 --> 27:44.152
to take down Maxime Le Mal.

27:44.288 --> 27:46.020
And that's where you come in.

27:46.155 --> 27:47.459
We need volunteers.

27:47.595 --> 27:49.392
Me! Me! Me!

27:49.528 --> 27:51.827
We are looking for
the strong, the mighty...

27:51.962 --> 27:52.995
Ooh. [groans]

27:53.131 --> 27:54.535
...the fearless.
Uh, nope.

27:54.671 --> 27:57.135
We need the best of the best.

27:57.270 --> 28:00.172
So, who's it going to be?
[chuckles]

28:02.239 --> 28:04.341
Yes, nice work, gentlemen.

[speaking Minionese]

28:06.382 --> 28:07.983
[laughing]

28:08.119 --> 28:12.020
The AVL is known for
cutting-edge weapons
and vehicles,

28:12.155 --> 28:15.385
but now we are developing
cutting-edge agents.

28:15.520 --> 28:18.889
And I can think of
no better guinea pigs than you.

28:19.025 --> 28:20.427
Guinea pigs!

to test our super serum.

into elite agents

far beyond those of mortal men.

and scary.

when I have a black belt.

with my head.

Yes, Sensei O'Sullivan.

30:11.275 --> 30:12.337
Hai!

30:16.280 --> 30:19.174
You, Moscovitch,
didn't I tell you
to cut that hair?

30:19.309 --> 30:21.075
You look like a sheepdog.

30:21.210 --> 30:22.484
Sorry, Sensei.

30:22.619 --> 30:24.385
[whimpers, giggles]

30:24.521 --> 30:27.984
Now, we have
two new students today
ready to begin their journey--

30:28.120 --> 30:31.087
Hi-yah! To awesomeness.

30:31.223 --> 30:33.322
-You, tiny girl.
-[gasps]

30:33.457 --> 30:35.624
Step forward
and tell us your name.

30:36.268 --> 30:37.267
Um...

30:37.403 --> 30:39.331
It's Britney.

30:40.098 --> 30:42.730
Uh, m-my name?

30:44.343 --> 30:46.335
I can't.

30:46.470 --> 30:48.808
There's no "can't" in karate.

30:48.944 --> 30:51.514
Ten push-ups after class!

30:51.649 --> 30:53.148
Hey, that's not fair.

30:53.283 --> 30:58.311
Huh! Ha! You better not be
talking back to your sensei.

30:58.446 --> 31:00.023
Hi-yah! [karate yell]

31:00.159 --> 31:03.553
Now, are you ready
to tell us your name
and participate?

31:04.262 --> 31:05.324
Mmm.

31:05.925 --> 31:07.825
I guess not.

31:07.961 --> 31:11.859
Then why don't you go sit
in the corner of
disgrace and reflection

31:11.994 --> 31:14.828
and think about
what kind of person
you wanna be?

31:19.604 --> 31:23.709
Now, am I gonna get
any trouble from you?

31:23.844 --> 31:25.471
Yeah, probably.

31:25.607 --> 31:27.015
Excuse me?
[bones pop]

31:27.150 --> 31:29.442
If you think
I'm above fighting children,

31:29.578 --> 31:31.889
you picked the wrong dojo.

[all gasp]

31:47.034 --> 31:48.735
[children cheer] Yeah!

31:48.871 --> 31:51.068
That was for my sister.

31:51.203 --> 31:52.734
[O'Sullivan screams]

31:54.371 --> 31:57.772
You broke my pinkie toe.

31:57.908 --> 32:02.382
[chuckles]
That's gonna be
a lot of push-ups.

32:02.518 --> 32:05.547
[Lucy] Okay,
then put this over here,
then the hair gel.

32:05.683 --> 32:07.689
Hair spray.
Oh, uh,
Mrs. Cunningham?

32:07.825 --> 32:09.188
Oh! Uh, yeah. [stammers] Hi.

32:09.323 --> 32:12.253
I have to say,
this is quite a résumé.

32:12.388 --> 32:14.060
Well, what can I say?

32:14.196 --> 32:15.658
I'm good at what I do.
[chuckles]

32:15.793 --> 32:18.626
Well, you are
exactly what we need here.

32:18.762 --> 32:21.294
Lot of vain, demanding divas
in this town.

32:21.430 --> 32:23.402
[both chuckle]

32:24.402 --> 32:26.307
I have a hair emergency, people.

Oh, Melora, I'm so sorry.

32:31.949 --> 32:33.408

32:33.543 --> 32:36.075
What? Oh, that is unacceptable.

32:36.211 --> 32:40.987
But you are in luck,
because Blanche here
is fantastic.

32:41.123 --> 32:43.257
Perfect. I'll be in my chair.

["Dynamite" plays]

32:50.264 --> 32:54.104
So, Melora,
what are we thinking?

32:54.239 --> 32:57.239
What if we just wet the hair
and let it dry in the air?

32:57.375 --> 32:59.832
Let nature do its thang...
[chuckles] ...you know?

32:59.968 --> 33:02.375
No, no, no, no.

It's-It's time
for a whole new Melora.

I want this.

Wow. Um...

Okay, let's start with color?

33:15.692 --> 33:17.995
Yes, color.
Because that's what
you start with.

33:20.092 --> 33:21.625
Little of this.

33:22.325 --> 33:23.825
Some of that.

58:52.157 --> 58:54.661
You know,
the most important part
of a heist

58:54.797 --> 58:58.530
is being constantly aware

01:00:11.034 --> 01:00:12.707
I'll hit him with this.

01:00:12.843 --> 01:00:15.470
Once he's knocked out,
we'll open the cage.

01:00:15.606 --> 01:00:18.306
That fuzzy demon
