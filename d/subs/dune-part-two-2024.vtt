Then, he's not <i>Lisan al-Gaib,</i>

21:20.047 --> 21:22.083
and you have no purpose
to serve.

21:22.116 --> 21:26.087
What else is left to do then
but to return your water
to the well?

21:26.120 --> 21:27.688
[clicks tongue] Huh.

21:28.790 --> 21:31.358
[indistinct chatter]

21:31.391 --> 21:32.560
[Paul] It's an honor, isn't it?

21:34.427 --> 21:35.830
I think you should
feel honored.

21:35.863 --> 21:37.899
Well, it was a choice
between this or death,

21:37.932 --> 21:39.767
so, you know, forgive me
if I'm not flattered.

21:41.936 --> 21:43.638
How does one become
a Reverend Mother?

21:43.671 --> 21:45.640
It's different from one culture
to another.

21:45.673 --> 21:47.575
Here on Arrakis,
I have no idea.

21:51.913 --> 21:54.081
You're afraid.

21:54.115 --> 21:56.017
Reverend Mothers are tasked
with holding the memories

21:56.050 --> 21:57.885
of all the Reverend Mothers
that came before them,

21:57.919 --> 22:01.088
so I'll be given centuries
of pain and sorrow.

22:01.923 --> 22:02.790
Is it dangerous?

22:03.791 --> 22:05.425
It's lethal for men.

22:06.060 --> 22:07.862
That's for sure.

22:07.895 --> 22:11.398
[Stilgar speaks Chakobsa]

[group laughing]

23:16.197 --> 23:18.132
What are you guys
laughing about?

23:18.165 --> 23:19.399
Don't bother. [chuckles]

23:24.572 --> 23:25.773
You don't believe in all this?

23:25.806 --> 23:27.440
[Chani] No, we don't.

23:27.474 --> 23:29.143
[Shishakli]
These are old Southern beliefs.

23:29.176 --> 23:31.444
Southern beliefs?

23:31.478 --> 23:34.782
Southern tribes believe
a messiah will come
to deliver us from evil.

23:34.815 --> 23:36.884
You don't believe
in the <i>Lisan al-Gaib?</i>

23:36.918 --> 23:39.220
[Chani] We believe in Fremen.

23:39.253 --> 23:41.589
[group speaking Chakobsa]

23:41.622 --> 23:44.725
You want to control people,
you tell them
a messiah will come.

23:44.759 --> 23:48.495
-Mm-hmm.
-Then they'll wait
for centuries.

23:48.529 --> 23:50.031
[Stilgar speaking Chakobsa]

23:51.565 --> 23:54.635
Now, we must pray.

24:02.109 --> 24:03.077
What about him?

24:03.110 --> 24:04.812
-[Chani] Stilgar?
-Mm-hmm.

24:04.845 --> 24:07.949
He's from the South.
You didn't notice his accent?

24:07.982 --> 24:10.685
[Chani and Shishakli laugh]

24:10.718 --> 24:12.820
[Stilgar praying in Chakobsa]

24:13.988 --> 24:15.222
[sighs]

24:17.091 --> 24:18.259

[Fremen nuns
speaking in Chakobsa]

24:40.715 --> 24:43.551
[whispers] I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.

24:43.584 --> 24:46.554
Fear, the little death
that brings total obliteration.

24:46.587 --> 24:48.656
I will face my fear. I will...

24:48.689 --> 24:51.659
[Fremen nuns continue

27:27.915 --> 27:30.217
She's right. She's right!

27:32.386 --> 27:33.420
It's no miracle.

27:35.022 --> 27:37.892
My mother was trained
to do that.

27:37.925 --> 27:40.828
Poison transmutation
is something advanced
Bene Gesserit can do.

27:44.298 --> 27:45.432
I'm not the <i>Mahdi.</i>

27:49.103 --> 27:50.304
I'm not here to lead.

27:56.511 --> 27:59.747
Let me fight beside you.
That's all I'm asking.

28:25.172 --> 28:26.173
[Jessica] Better.

28:27.274 --> 28:28.275
[Paul] How is she?

28:29.910 --> 28:31.412
[Jessica] She was frightened,
but she's...

28:33.080 --> 28:34.081
she's okay.

[Jessica breathes heavily]

28:40.287 --> 28:41.188
[Jessica whispers] Paul.

28:44.425 --> 28:46.126
She talks to me.

28:49.330 --> 28:51.165
She believes in you.

She says...

28:57.238 --> 29:01.075
[speaking Chakobsa]

29:03.210 --> 29:05.346
You're so close now.

29:05.379 --> 29:09.383
Only one step remains
and you will become
the <i>Kwisatz Haderach.</i>

29:10.484 --> 29:12.253
Only one step remains.

29:13.220 --> 29:14.855
You must do what I did.

29:14.888 --> 29:18.192
You must drink
the Water of Life.

29:18.225 --> 29:21.895
And your mind,
it's gon-- it's gonna open
and you will see.

29:32.940 --> 29:37.579
[Stilgar] If you wanna fight
with us, first thing,
you must learn

29:37.612 --> 29:39.547
to be one with the desert.

29:41.181 --> 29:44.552
So, here is a tent
and enough food.

29:44.586 --> 29:49.323
I want you to cross
that small erg and come back.

29:50.124 --> 29:51.859
Travel by night.

29:51.892 --> 29:53.360

-Yes.
-Oh.

29:56.130 --> 29:57.498
[Stilgar sighs]

29:57.532 --> 29:59.066
Anything else I should know?

29:59.099 --> 30:01.503
Uh, beside the worms
and the Harkonnens,

30:01.536 --> 30:05.272
beware of the trapdoor spiders.

30:05.306 --> 30:08.876
Centipedes are very nasty.
Not the big ones.

30:08.909 --> 30:10.545
They are harmless.

30:10.578 --> 30:14.248
But the little ones,
you have to worry about.
And... Oh!

30:16.950 --> 30:20.387
Don't ever,
ever listen to the jinn.

30:22.657 --> 30:24.325
-The jinn?
-Jinn.

30:24.358 --> 30:26.026

30:27.461 --> 30:30.130
They whisper at night.

30:34.301 --> 30:37.104

They are demons.

like a drunk lizard.

32:18.573 --> 32:19.373
[chuckles]

32:21.241 --> 32:22.744
Yeah, I'm doing
pretty good so far.

32:22.777 --> 32:25.345
Yeah, well, you're not even
in worm territory yet.

32:44.364 --> 32:46.066
[Chani] You have to break up
your rhythm.

32:50.170 --> 32:52.406
Like this.

32:52.439 --> 32:55.309
[Paul] Now, that's interesting
because in the filmbooks
I've studied,

32:55.342 --> 32:58.613
the anthropologists say,
in order to properly sandwalk,
you actually have--

33:02.416 --> 33:04.552
Never mind. Please keep going.

33:13.193 --> 33:15.162
[soft music playing]

33:33.080 --> 33:36.416
You know, I'm the only one
who believes you're gonna
make it until summer?

33:36.450 --> 33:38.218
Everyone else thinks
you won't make it two weeks.

33:39.587 --> 33:41.054
If you wanna follow us
in the desert,

33:41.088 --> 33:42.524
you need to know
how windtraps work.

33:42.557 --> 33:44.358
So, listen to me.

33:44.391 --> 33:46.661
They're simple,
but they require
constant attention.

33:46.694 --> 33:50.163
Uh, this right here,
it captures the moisture

33:50.197 --> 33:51.633
and then it carries it
into that pocket.

33:52.734 --> 33:55.803
Uh, and these are the filters.

33:55.837 --> 33:57.505
They need to be changed
every three days.

33:59.406 --> 34:00.274
What?

34:02.744 --> 34:03.745
[chuckles]

34:05.112 --> 34:06.614

He's training with the Fremen.

34:13.721 --> 34:15.690

Don't worry.

34:16.824 --> 34:17.692
Mm-hmm.

34:19.259 --> 34:22.730
You're right. If we want
to protect your brother,

34:22.764 --> 34:25.867
we need all the Fremen
to believe in the prophecy.

about the desert.

41:08.803 --> 41:12.506
You harness
the very power of it.

41:12.540 --> 41:17.278
We can stop them together,
bury them in the sand
where they belong.

So that this planet
can be yours once more.

I? I would... [sighs]
would strike
even further north.

41:29.657 --> 41:31.525
Then I will go further north.

41:31.559 --> 41:34.228
And the further north you go,
the more likely it is you die.

41:34.261 --> 41:35.896
[speaking Chakobsa]

41:45.906 --> 41:47.541
[Fedaykin fighters chattering]

41:58.119 --> 42:01.222
[Stilgar]
I see strength in you.

42:01.255 --> 42:02.623
[speaking Chakobsa]

42:02.656 --> 42:03.524

42:06.861 --> 42:08.095
Come, come.

42:08.129 --> 42:09.730
[man laughing]

42:18.205 --> 42:23.911
You shall be know
among us as <i>Usul.</i>

42:23.944 --> 42:25.679
-[man] <i>Usul.</i>
<i>-Usul.</i>

42:25.713 --> 42:29.784
[Stilgar] <i>Usul.</i> And now,
a Fedaykin is a fighter

42:29.817 --> 42:31.018
and needs a war name.

42:31.986 --> 42:33.287
You must choose.

42:38.159 --> 42:39.627
How do you call the, uh...

42:41.062 --> 42:42.797
The small desert mouse, again?

42:42.830 --> 42:44.198
[all laughing]

42:44.231 --> 42:45.933
<i>-Muad'Dib?</i>
-[Paul] <i>Muad'Dib.</i>

42:45.966 --> 42:48.602
No, no, no. [shushes]

42:48.636 --> 42:52.306
<i>Muad'Dib</i> is wise
in the ways of the desert.

42:52.339 --> 42:53.741
<i>Muad'Dib...</i>

42:54.775 --> 42:57.211
[sighs] creates his own water.

42:57.244 --> 43:01.115
The constellation that points
to the North Star,
we call <i>Muad'Dib.</i>

43:01.148 --> 43:02.950
"The One Who Points the Way."

43:04.819 --> 43:06.053
That is a powerful name.

43:10.991 --> 43:15.062
Now you are our brother. Mmm.

43:15.096 --> 43:18.232
Paul <i>Muad'Dib Usul.</i>

43:20.167 --> 43:22.803

[Paul and Stilgar laugh]

43:33.347 --> 43:35.850

44:02.076 --> 44:04.678
[Stilgar speaks Chakobsa,

44:16.924 --> 44:18.325
Father, I found my way.

44:18.359 --> 44:20.694
[soft music playing]

44:26.400 --> 44:29.403
[footsteps approaching]

44:35.510 --> 44:36.677
[Paul] It's breathtaking.

44:38.445 --> 44:39.747
[sighs]

44:45.419 --> 44:46.687
[Chani] Hmm.

44:48.255 --> 44:52.359
Look. Right there. Spice.

44:52.393 --> 44:55.229
Arrakis is so beautiful
when the sun is low.

45:02.903 --> 45:07.408
Where you're from, does water
really fall from the sky?

45:07.441 --> 45:09.743
Oh, hm, yes.

45:09.777 --> 45:12.947
Sometimes it rains
for weeks on Caladan.

45:12.980 --> 45:15.249
Where you see sand here,
imagine water.

45:18.419 --> 45:22.524
Our castle stands on cliffs
high above the sea.

45:22.557 --> 45:25.492
If you dive in,
you can't reach the bottom.

45:25.527 --> 45:29.496
-[Chani] You dive in?
-Yes, it's called swimming.

45:29.531 --> 45:32.333
[laughs] I don't--
I don't believe you, <i>Usul.</i>

45:32.366 --> 45:33.434
<i>Usul.</i>

45:36.136 --> 45:37.371
What's your secret name?

45:39.807 --> 45:41.442
<i>Sihaya.</i>

45:41.475 --> 45:42.843
<i>-Sihaya.</i>
-Hmm.

45:44.311 --> 45:46.046
What does that mean?

45:46.080 --> 45:47.915
Means Desert Spring.

45:47.948 --> 45:49.016
"Desert Spring."

45:50.951 --> 45:52.419
-I love it.
-I hate it.

45:53.588 --> 45:55.456
It's from some stupid prophecy.

45:56.490 --> 45:57.525
I prefer Chani.

45:58.593 --> 46:00.127
I prefer Chani, too, then.

46:07.234 --> 46:09.169
Do you think Stilgar
would teach me?

46:09.203 --> 46:10.904
-[Chani] To ride?
-[Paul] Yeah.

46:10.938 --> 46:14.174
[Chani laughs]
No. Only Fremen ride worms.

46:14.208 --> 46:15.976
Well, I thought I'd become one,
didn't I?

46:16.010 --> 46:17.878
By name, not by blood.

46:20.214 --> 46:24.918
Your blood comes
from Dukes and Great Houses.

46:26.954 --> 46:29.256
We don't have that here.

46:29.290 --> 46:33.294
Here, we're equal,
men and women alike.

46:33.327 --> 46:35.496
What we do,
we do for the benefit of all.

46:35.530 --> 46:37.898
Well, I'd very much like
to be equal to you.

46:44.138 --> 46:47.374
Paul <i>Muad'Dib Usul...</i>

46:49.276 --> 46:51.445
maybe you could be Fremen.

46:54.649 --> 46:56.050
Maybe I'll show you the way.

48:37.284 --> 48:41.656
[Baron Harkonnen]
Fremen attacks on your watch.

48:41.689 --> 48:47.662
Your orders were to restore
spice production
to full capacity.

48:47.695 --> 48:50.130
Do you know
what it means if you fail?

48:51.733 --> 48:55.637
The Emperor will take spice
out of our control.

48:56.638 --> 48:58.272
Tighten your grip, Rabban.

48:58.305 --> 49:00.340
[breathes heavily, whispers]
Uncle.

49:20.562 --> 49:23.363
It's okay. It's okay.

49:26.668 --> 49:27.535
Hey.

49:30.471 --> 49:33.575
I'm here, I'm here.

49:33.608 --> 49:36.678
It's been a while
since you've had
one of those nightmares.

49:36.711 --> 49:37.679
Mm.

49:41.549 --> 49:43.685
[Chani] Tell me,
what was it about?

<i>starving to death...</i>

50:10.845 --> 50:12.212
<i>because of me.</i>

50:18.118 --> 50:21.255
[Chani] You've been exposed
to spice for a long time.

50:21.288 --> 50:23.357
It can create weird dreams.

50:23.390 --> 50:25.025
[breathes heavily]

50:30.397 --> 50:31.265
It's a big day.

50:33.433 --> 50:35.068
We can ask Stilgar
to call it off.

No. I'm fine.

You are brave.
We all know that.

Heh? Be simple.

Be direct. Nothing fancy.

-Nothing fancy.
-Hey, I'm serious.

51:18.312 --> 51:20.782
Nothing fancy or you will shame
my teaching.

51:20.815 --> 51:24.852
I won't shame you.
I understand.

You know I can't.

01:00:54.989 --> 01:00:56.423
She's asking why.

01:00:56.457 --> 01:00:58.425
Because I must continue
fighting in the North,

01:00:58.459 --> 01:01:00.661
to protect you down
there in the South.

01:01:02.429 --> 01:01:06.066
She says she can tell
when you lie.

01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:09.403
Tell her that's because
our mother keeps spreading
dangerous tales.

01:01:17.011 --> 01:01:18.812
What is she saying now?

01:01:18.846 --> 01:01:21.248
She says you're blinded
by love,

01:01:21.282 --> 01:01:23.450
and she reminds you that
you must reserve your hand

01:01:23.484 --> 01:01:25.319
for the most
strategic alliance.

01:01:28.355 --> 01:01:31.325
She's also wondering
why you don't believe
in who you are.

01:01:31.358 --> 01:01:32.726
I do believe.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.695
I believe I matter
to these people.

01:01:36.297 --> 01:01:38.299
And I believe I'm making
a difference in this war.

01:01:40.334 --> 01:01:42.069
We're nearly
at the gates of the city.

01:01:42.102 --> 01:01:44.972
-That's not what she means.
-I know what she means.

01:01:45.005 --> 01:01:47.341
Do you not think I also feel
the weight of the prophecy?

01:01:47.374 --> 01:01:49.343
It's not a prophecy.

01:01:49.376 --> 01:01:51.078
It's a story that you
keep telling,

01:01:51.111 --> 01:01:53.147
but it's not their story,
it's yours.

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:56.383
They deserve to be led
by one of their own.

01:01:56.417 --> 01:01:59.119
What your people did
to this world is heartbreaking.

01:01:59.153 --> 01:02:00.821
We gave them something
to hope for.

01:02:00.854 --> 01:02:02.356

I'll be waiting for you.

-[Rabban] How much?
-[Harkonnen soldier]
We lost...

01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:58.339
eighty percent
of our last crop.

01:03:58.372 --> 01:04:02.242
My Lord Rabban,
you should not leave
the security perimeter.

01:04:02.276 --> 01:04:04.878
Security perimeter?
The rats are already inside.

01:04:04.912 --> 01:04:06.548
The Fremen Demon
might be with them.

01:04:06.581 --> 01:04:08.282
[Rabban] I hope so.

01:04:08.315 --> 01:04:08.949
[Harkonnen soldier]
We're tracking them, my Lord.

01:04:10.150 --> 01:04:12.953

01:04:56.230 --> 01:04:57.665
Still negative, my Lord.

01:04:57.699 --> 01:04:59.266
[Rabban] Why do I have to do
everything myself?

01:05:02.403 --> 01:05:03.470
Open range!

[Emperor] <i>Muad'Dib.</i>

01:08:41.756 --> 01:08:45.760
Some new Fremen prophet?

01:08:45.792 --> 01:08:48.696
[Princess Irulan]
It's not the first time we've
had frictions with the Fremen.

01:08:48.729 --> 01:08:50.531
None of this magnitude.

01:08:54.736 --> 01:08:56.336
So, my dear daughter...

01:08:57.604 --> 01:08:59.807
how would you deal
with this prophet?

01:09:01.341 --> 01:09:02.910
[breathes heavily]

01:09:06.212 --> 01:09:08.883
If this <i>Muad'Dib</i>
is a religious figure,

01:09:10.618 --> 01:09:12.386
you can't use direct force.

01:09:13.888 --> 01:09:17.323
Repression only makes
a religion flourish.

01:09:17.357 --> 01:09:19.426
You'll only end up
humiliating yourself.

01:09:19.459 --> 01:09:21.194
You underestimate my Sardaukar.

01:09:21.228 --> 01:09:23.898
You underestimate
the power of faith.

01:09:25.667 --> 01:09:27.769
[chuckles]

01:09:27.801 --> 01:09:31.371

once again that she was
my most acute student.

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:36.511
-You'd send assassins?
-[Princess Irulan] No.

01:09:36.544 --> 01:09:38.310
Prophets get stronger
when they die.

01:09:39.981 --> 01:09:42.582
Let the conflict
on Arrakis turn into war.

01:09:42.617 --> 01:09:45.787
You then bring peace.
As a savior.

01:09:48.321 --> 01:09:50.256
You'd be a formidable empress.

01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:54.562
[tense music playing]

01:09:54.595 --> 01:09:57.532
<i>Muad'Dib.</i> The prophet.

01:09:57.565 --> 01:10:00.233
The one who points the way.

01:10:00.267 --> 01:10:02.436
These are our own
religious patterns,
aren't they?

01:10:02.469 --> 01:10:03.738
This is our doing.

01:10:07.407 --> 01:10:10.444
<i>Muad'Dib</i> means kangaroo mouse.

01:10:10.477 --> 01:10:12.379
An unusual war name
for a Fremen.

01:10:14.582 --> 01:10:17.685
-What if Paul Atreides
were still alive?
-[distorted] Enough!

01:10:17.719 --> 01:10:21.856
This must not come out.
Even to your father's ears.
Understand?

01:10:22.790 --> 01:10:25.727
I do, Reverend Mother.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:28.996
[Reverend Mother Mohiam]
If Paul is alive,
he likely knows the truth.

01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:30.965
And should
the Great Houses learn

01:10:30.998 --> 01:10:34.334
that your father was behind
the liquidation
of the Atreides,

01:10:34.367 --> 01:10:37.705
your father will face war
and lose the throne.

01:10:39.674 --> 01:10:41.008
Then what hope is there?

01:10:42.543 --> 01:10:43.410
Hope?

01:10:44.879 --> 01:10:49.016
We are Bene Gesserit.
We don't hope, we plan.

01:10:50.383 --> 01:10:54.354
Paul is not our only prospect.

01:10:54.387 --> 01:10:59.392
The Baron's youngest nephew,
Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen,
will inherit Arrakis.

01:11:00.928 --> 01:11:02.462
He may be the answer.

01:11:02.496 --> 01:11:05.032
Feyd-Rautha? He's psychotic.

01:11:05.066 --> 01:11:07.001
That's irrelevant.

01:11:07.034 --> 01:11:11.371
The question is,
can we control him?

01:11:11.404 --> 01:11:12.807
And I intend to find out.

A long way to come
just to watch our prospect

01:20:16.884 --> 01:20:19.153
[Baron Harkonnen] He has failed
to protect spice production.

01:20:19.186 --> 01:20:21.355
Rabban will be reassigned.

01:20:23.957 --> 01:20:25.292

Tame Arrakis, Feyd.

01:20:28.262 --> 01:20:30.864
Free the spice.
I'll make you Emperor.

01:20:43.177 --> 01:20:45.012
[clicks tongue] Emperor?

01:20:48.215 --> 01:20:49.183
How?

01:20:51.318 --> 01:20:54.254
The Emperor helped me
destroy the Atreides.

01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:58.359
He lent his own army
to the cause.

01:20:58.392 --> 01:21:00.928
A serious crime.

01:21:00.961 --> 01:21:05.165
If it came to light,
the Great Houses would rise
against him.

01:21:05.999 --> 01:21:07.201
And then...

01:21:08.469 --> 01:21:10.904
who will sit on the throne?

01:21:11.673 --> 01:21:14.908

You're following me.

01:21:57.652 --> 01:21:58.686
Am I?

01:22:00.655 --> 01:22:02.189
I may have gotten lost.

01:22:04.358 --> 01:22:09.062
Will you show me the way
out of this maze,
my Lord na-Baron?

01:22:16.303 --> 01:22:18.472

01:22:21.743 --> 01:22:23.043
I don't think so.

01:22:24.011 --> 01:22:26.413
I'm Lady Margot Fenring.

01:22:26.447 --> 01:22:28.750

And what makes

[Feyd-Rautha] I remember now.

01:23:03.718 --> 01:23:06.420
I dreamed about you last night.

01:23:06.453 --> 01:23:08.155
[Lady Margot Fenring]

Bene Gesserit tricks.

01:23:16.430 --> 01:23:18.700
And what do you know
about the Bene Gesserit?

01:23:22.604 --> 01:23:23.470
Tell me.

[Lady Margot Fenring]
A sociopath.
Of high intelligence.

Driven. Cruel.

01:24:55.195 --> 01:24:57.264
But strongly motivated
by honor.

01:24:58.398 --> 01:25:00.535
He yearns to be hurt.

01:25:00.568 --> 01:25:02.502
He loves pain.

01:25:02.537 --> 01:25:04.137
[Reverend Mother Mohiam]
Can he be redeemed?

01:25:04.171 --> 01:25:05.640
[Lady Margot Fenring]
He can be controlled.

01:25:05.673 --> 01:25:07.441
He's sexually vulnerable.

01:25:09.611 --> 01:25:10.477
And?

01:25:11.946 --> 01:25:13.615
The bloodline is secured.

01:25:15.382 --> 01:25:18.218

01:25:19.252 --> 01:25:21.589
You did well, Margot.

01:25:21.623 --> 01:25:24.826
Respectfully, why didn't you
test him yourself?

01:25:26.293 --> 01:25:28.730
I'm a motherly figure.

01:25:28.763 --> 01:25:32.366
And based on what happened
between him and his own mother,

01:25:32.399 --> 01:25:34.936
I didn't expect
to be effective.

01:25:34.969 --> 01:25:36.571
What happened between
him and his mother?

01:25:37.371 --> 01:25:38.238
He murdered her.

01:25:39.674 --> 01:25:42.644
Desire and humiliation.

01:25:43.911 --> 01:25:46.514
Those are his levers.

01:25:46.547 --> 01:25:48.916
If Feyd-Rautha
prevails on Arrakis,

01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:51.653

how to control him.

[Chani] Paul?

01:54:34.108 --> 01:54:35.142
Paul.

01:54:37.378 --> 01:54:39.980
I'm here. I'm here. Hey.

01:54:40.013 --> 01:54:41.048
[gasps softly]

01:54:43.384 --> 01:54:44.652
[shouts] What happened?

01:54:46.220 --> 01:54:47.522
What happened?

01:54:58.165 --> 01:54:59.701
He's dead.

01:54:59.734 --> 01:55:02.469
His vital signs are so low,
they can't be detected.

01:55:02.503 --> 01:55:03.971
But he's alive.

01:55:04.004 --> 01:55:05.506
What did you do to him?

01:55:06.974 --> 01:55:09.076
No, not that.
Why would he do that?

01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:10.177
Why would you do that?

01:55:10.210 --> 01:55:12.346
[speaking Chakobsa]

01:55:19.253 --> 01:55:22.657
Chani, his body
is fighting the poison
and he needs your help.

01:55:22.690 --> 01:55:24.091
You do it.

01:55:25.259 --> 01:55:26.360
You did this to him.

01:55:26.393 --> 01:55:28.061
You did this
to your own son!

01:55:28.095 --> 01:55:29.163
You do it!

01:55:29.196 --> 01:55:31.198
Fix it yourself.

01:55:31.231 --> 01:55:34.602
Chani, you might not believe
in the prophecy,
but you're a part of it.

01:55:34.636 --> 01:55:36.336
[Chani] You're the poison.

01:55:36.370 --> 01:55:39.072
You and your lies.
Why would you do this?

01:55:39.106 --> 01:55:40.274

[Paul breathing heavily]

[Jessica]
I'm sorry about Chani.

01:58:05.787 --> 01:58:07.689
She'll come to understand.

01:58:08.590 --> 01:58:09.824
I've seen it.

01:58:11.458 --> 01:58:13.427
[whispers] You can see?

01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:15.730
The visions are clear now.

01:58:17.899 --> 01:58:21.703
I see possible futures.
All at once.

01:58:22.870 --> 01:58:26.406
Our enemies are all around us.

01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:28.776
And in so many futures,
they prevail.

01:58:29.711 --> 01:58:31.579
But I do see a way.

01:58:32.780 --> 01:58:35.182
There is a narrow way through.

01:58:45.459 --> 01:58:47.294
I saw our bloodline, Mother.

01:59:08.281 --> 01:59:09.684
Did my father know?

01:59:15.723 --> 01:59:18.893
I didn't know myself,
until I took the worm's poison.

01:59:26.768 --> 01:59:28.402
We're Harkonnens.

01:59:30.872 --> 01:59:32.439
[sighs]

01:59:32.472 --> 01:59:34.542
So this is how we'll survive.

01:59:36.309 --> 01:59:37.745
By being Harkonnens.

Stilgar, you can stop this.
Do you hear me?

02:01:20.782 --> 02:01:22.482
You have the power

02:01:22.517 --> 02:01:23.985

02:01:24.018 --> 02:01:25.887
You are not allowed

02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:27.588
If you want to speak,
you know what to do.

This is none

Rabban Harkonnen himself
killed my family.

02:01:53.981 --> 02:01:55.950
He gave me this scar
to remember him by.

02:01:55.983 --> 02:01:58.019
This is all of my business.

If you wish

02:02:49.502 --> 02:02:52.439
you must take his place
by defeating him

02:02:52.472 --> 02:02:54.876
and returning his water
to the well.

02:02:54.909 --> 02:02:58.478

Paul Atreides

02:06:50.878 --> 02:06:52.379
He challenges my father.

02:06:53.848 --> 02:06:55.616
You've never been
on Arrakis.

02:06:57.084 --> 02:06:59.086
It's quite impressive.
You'll see.

02:06:59.120 --> 02:07:00.721
Was this all upon
your advice?

02:07:00.754 --> 02:07:02.790
What?

02:07:02.823 --> 02:07:05.860
Did you counsel my father
to exterminate the Atreides?

02:07:05.893 --> 02:07:09.230
Of course I did. Why else
would it have happened?

02:07:09.263 --> 02:07:11.699
You tried to sacrifice
an entire bloodline.

02:07:11.732 --> 02:07:13.801
And I was right
to do it.

02:07:13.834 --> 02:07:16.971
The <i>Kwisatz Haderach</i>
is a form of power

02:07:17.004 --> 02:07:19.240
that our world
has not yet seen.

02:07:19.273 --> 02:07:21.876
The ultimate power.

02:07:21.909 --> 02:07:23.744
For ninety generations,

02:07:23.777 --> 02:07:25.813
we have supervised
House Atreides.

02:07:25.846 --> 02:07:28.916
They were promising,
but they were becoming
dangerously defiant.

02:07:28.949 --> 02:07:32.386
Their bloodline
had to be terminated.

02:07:32.419 --> 02:07:34.889
That is why we have put
many bloodlines at work.

02:07:34.922 --> 02:07:35.956
Several prospects.

02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:37.424
But it's backfired.

02:07:37.458 --> 02:07:39.160
Paul is alive.

02:07:39.193 --> 02:07:41.128
And if
he defeats Feyd-Rautha,
my father--

02:07:41.162 --> 02:07:45.366
Your father
will lose the throne
no matter who prevails.

02:07:45.399 --> 02:07:48.402
But there is one way
your family can remain
in power

02:07:48.435 --> 02:07:51.872
and, through you,
the continuation
of our stewardship.

02:07:52.973 --> 02:07:54.842
One. Way.

02:07:55.442 --> 02:07:57.945
Are you prepared?

02:07:57.978 --> 02:08:00.681
You've been preparing me
my whole life,
Reverend Mother.

02:08:02.983 --> 02:08:05.286
You're heading north
with the others?

02:08:05.319 --> 02:08:07.254
I'm Fedaykin.

02:08:07.288 --> 02:08:09.990
I follow my leaders.
If fighting goes north,
I go north.

02:08:10.024 --> 02:08:11.392
Paul didn't have
a choice, Chani.

02:08:11.425 --> 02:08:14.061
I won't be fighting for him.

02:08:14.094 --> 02:08:15.396
I'm fighting for my people.

02:08:19.266 --> 02:08:21.101
I came to wish you
best of luck.

02:08:22.369 --> 02:08:23.938
I'd wish you the same,

02:08:25.906 --> 02:08:27.474
but it seems
you've won your battle.

02:08:40.154 --> 02:08:42.156
[whooshing]

02:08:50.798 --> 02:08:52.099
[Gurney] He took the bait.

02:08:58.839 --> 02:09:00.774
[Paul] Oh, the Emperor's
very obliging.

02:09:01.809 --> 02:09:03.377
He's right on time.

02:09:36.477 --> 02:09:38.846
What is he doing here?

02:09:38.879 --> 02:09:40.981
I brought spice production
under control.

02:09:44.151 --> 02:09:45.319
What do we do?

02:09:46.887 --> 02:09:49.591
Send messages
to the Great Houses.

02:09:49.624 --> 02:09:53.861
Tell them that Arrakis
is under Sardaukar attack.

02:09:53.894 --> 02:09:56.564
Tell them, their future
hangs in the balance.

02:10:20.487 --> 02:10:22.423
[whispering in Chakobsa]

02:10:23.924 --> 02:10:26.427
[Paul] When the storm
hits this ridge,

02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:28.929
Gurney will open
the way for you, Stilgar,

02:10:28.962 --> 02:10:31.231
so you can enter
the basin from the West

02:10:31.265 --> 02:10:33.601
and distract
their defense systems.

02:10:33.635 --> 02:10:35.436
Chani, I want you
and your Fedaykin

02:10:35.469 --> 02:10:36.970
to then attack
from the East,

02:10:37.938 --> 02:10:39.973
inside the basin.

02:10:40.007 --> 02:10:42.109
I'll strike
from the North,
head on,

in the rules of the heart.
