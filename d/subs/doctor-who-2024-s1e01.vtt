WEBVTT

00:06.000 --> 00:09.680
[theme song playing]

01:08.360 --> 01:09.360
[gasps]

01:13.400 --> 01:14.440
[sighs]

01:20.520 --> 01:21.680
Who are you? [chuckles]

01:23.760 --> 01:24.920
I'm the Doctor.

01:26.560 --> 01:29.520
You don't have to stand over there.
Come and have a look!

01:30.360 --> 01:31.760
It's called the TARDIS.

01:32.880 --> 01:35.160
[Ruby whoops, chuckles]

01:35.160 --> 01:36.320
Nice.

01:36.320 --> 01:38.440
But hold on. I can't call you Doctor.

01:39.080 --> 01:40.560
No, I wanna know your name.

01:40.560 --> 01:42.360
Yeah, that's, uh-- that's tricky.

01:43.080 --> 01:44.200
Because I was adopted,

01:44.200 --> 01:49.080
and the planet that took me in,
they were kinda-- they were kinda posh.

01:49.080 --> 01:52.320
They'd use titles
like the Doctor or the Bishop

01:52.840 --> 01:55.520
or the Rani or the Conquistador.

01:55.520 --> 01:56.600
[chuckles]

01:56.600 --> 01:58.920
Say "Doctor" for a thousand years,
and it becomes my name.

01:58.920 --> 02:02.720
Okay. "The planet". Parking that.

02:02.720 --> 02:04.320
"Thousand years".

02:04.320 --> 02:05.800
Double-parked.

02:05.800 --> 02:10.640
So, you're a doctor,
but you're the police?

02:10.640 --> 02:12.240
Police box, no.

02:12.240 --> 02:14.040
- No, no, no, no, that's a disguise.
- Oh.

02:14.040 --> 02:17.880
Inside, it's a time and space machine,
but outside, it's-- it's like a chameleon.

02:18.400 --> 02:19.880
'Cause once I landed in 1963,

02:19.880 --> 02:22.520
and they used to have police boxes
on street corners.

02:22.520 --> 02:23.960
- 1963?
- Yeah.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.280
- [controls beeping]
- Okay.

02:26.280 --> 02:29.400
Ooh, jukebox? I like that.

02:29.400 --> 02:32.040
- [chuckles]
- Okay. So back to the planet.

02:32.040 --> 02:33.840
My world is called Gallifrey.

02:33.840 --> 02:35.480
- Gallifrey.
- [Doctor] Mmm.

02:35.480 --> 02:36.800
And where's that?

02:36.800 --> 02:37.880
Gone!

02:40.000 --> 02:41.560
Ruby, it's gone, it's gone.

02:44.280 --> 02:45.280
[sighs]

02:45.880 --> 02:46.960
[Doctor] They died.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.560
There was a genocide, and they died.

02:54.080 --> 02:56.400
So the one that was adopted
was the only one left.

02:57.080 --> 02:59.560
I am the last of the Time Lords.

02:59.560 --> 03:05.240
And I am so, so glad to be alive.

03:06.680 --> 03:07.680
This thing flies.

03:08.640 --> 03:10.120
- Do you wanna see?
- [stammers, grunts]

03:10.120 --> 03:11.360
[chuckles]

03:12.120 --> 03:13.520
[the sonic whirrs]

03:14.720 --> 03:15.720
[Ruby screams]

03:15.720 --> 03:18.960
[TARDIS warbling]

03:18.960 --> 03:21.080
[both laugh]

03:21.080 --> 03:23.120
Let's have a random landing.

03:24.240 --> 03:26.920
- [Ruby exclaims, pants]
- Whoo-hoo!

03:26.920 --> 03:29.040
[exclaiming]

03:30.200 --> 03:32.520
150 million years in the past.

03:32.520 --> 03:33.600
- No!
- Really.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.400
No, you've gotta be kidding.
You are kidding.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.120
Don't be so ridiculous.

03:37.120 --> 03:39.080
[sighs, panting]

03:41.320 --> 03:43.400
- Are there dinosaurs out there?
- I don't know.

03:43.400 --> 03:45.520
- [chuckles]
- Go and have a look.

03:47.280 --> 03:49.840
[shrieks, chuckles]

03:49.840 --> 03:50.920
Wait, no!

03:52.440 --> 03:54.600
- Is it safe? [pants]
- [controls beep]

03:54.600 --> 03:57.120
What if I change history
by stepping on a butterfly or summat?

03:57.120 --> 04:00.160
Well, that's not gonna happen, is it?
Who steps on butterflies?

04:00.160 --> 04:03.400
You'd literally have to be like,
"Wait. Come here, butterfly.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.320
- Come here. Have it!"
- [chuckles]

04:05.320 --> 04:06.600
[Doctor chuckles]

04:10.840 --> 04:12.640
Oh, my God. [chuckles]

04:12.640 --> 04:13.760
That's--

04:13.760 --> 04:15.280
[dinosaur bellows]

04:15.280 --> 04:16.880
[Ruby] That's so beautiful.

04:16.880 --> 04:18.800
- [chuckles, gasps]
- [Doctor chuckles]

04:18.800 --> 04:23.320
And TARDIS stands for
Time And Relative Dimension In Space.

04:23.320 --> 04:24.400
- [chuckles]
- [Doctor] Eh?

04:24.400 --> 04:26.240
So we've moved location as well.

04:26.240 --> 04:27.320
[chuckles]

04:28.280 --> 04:31.160
This will be North America.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.040
[Ruby] Huh.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.880
One day, this is Wyoming.

04:34.880 --> 04:36.120
Wow.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.120
[Doctor] Little town called Green River.

04:43.120 --> 04:44.280
Oh!

04:45.720 --> 04:46.960
What's wrong?

04:47.680 --> 04:49.280
- Did I do something wrong?
- Uh--

04:49.280 --> 04:52.280
Because I'm Rubathon Blue
of the 57th Hemisphere Hatchlings,

04:52.280 --> 04:55.000
- and I do not do wrong things, Doctor.
- But--

04:55.000 --> 04:57.920
If you have made an incorrect accusation,
I will have to kill you.

04:57.920 --> 05:00.760
No, no, no. Look, just wait.
[chuckles] Wait a minute.

05:01.800 --> 05:02.800
Let's--

05:02.800 --> 05:05.080
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. Just--

05:05.800 --> 05:07.000
[Ruby panting]

05:11.960 --> 05:13.400
[blows]

05:18.520 --> 05:19.960
Am I missing summat?

05:21.480 --> 05:22.800
Nothing.

05:24.000 --> 05:26.480
Let's try that again, okay?

05:26.480 --> 05:27.960
- [chuckles]
- [sighs]

05:27.960 --> 05:29.040
- [Ruby] Thank you.
- Yeah.

05:29.040 --> 05:30.480
Yeah, yeah.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.360
Okay, uh, controls are new.

05:36.880 --> 05:40.760
Completely forgot,
the butterfly compensation switch.

05:40.760 --> 05:41.840
[controls beep]

05:41.840 --> 05:44.280
Good. Right. Yes. Let's go forward.

05:44.280 --> 05:46.000
Give me a number. Give me a year.

05:46.000 --> 05:47.280
- [stammers] Two...
- Two...

05:47.280 --> 05:49.880
- ...one, five, oh...
- ...one, five, oh...

05:49.880 --> 05:51.800
- [grunts] ...six.
- ...six!

05:51.800 --> 05:54.080
- Aha! Five numbers! I like it!
- [Ruby chuckling]

05:54.080 --> 05:55.240
- [Doctor grunts]
- [shrieks]

06:06.840 --> 06:08.840
[TARDIS warbles, thuds]

06:11.920 --> 06:13.080
But we're indoors.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.520
- Ooh.
- We got through the walls.

06:16.520 --> 06:17.760
[electricity crackles]

06:17.760 --> 06:21.600
Aha! Is that like a, uh,
matter transporter like in <i>Star Trek</i>?

06:21.600 --> 06:25.200
[chuckles] We gotta visit them one day.

06:25.200 --> 06:26.280
[chuckles]

06:26.280 --> 06:29.480
Hey, but you said
the TARDIS was like a chameleon.

06:29.480 --> 06:31.120
But it still looks like a police box.

06:31.120 --> 06:33.120
Oh, it's, uh-- it's broken.

06:33.120 --> 06:35.200
- Most of the universe is knackered, babes.
- Oh.

06:35.200 --> 06:37.120
Okay. Come, come, come, come, come.

06:37.120 --> 06:39.120
Oh, it stinks. [groans]

06:41.240 --> 06:42.240
[groans]

06:44.120 --> 06:46.800
[Doctor]
Something is wrong with this place.

06:46.800 --> 06:50.360
It is a space station reaching overload.

06:50.360 --> 06:52.880
- [both exclaim]
- No, you made it worse.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.680
- [creature roars]
- [Ruby shouts]

06:55.480 --> 06:57.280
- No, that is worse.
- [both panting]

06:57.280 --> 06:59.680
[creature snarling, echoes]

06:59.680 --> 07:01.160
[snarling]

07:01.160 --> 07:02.240
Is that a monster?

07:02.240 --> 07:03.320
[Doctor pants]

07:03.320 --> 07:05.000
No. No, don't be silly.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.880
Ruby, there's no such thing as monsters.
They're just...

07:06.880 --> 07:08.360
[creature growls]

07:08.360 --> 07:10.520
Just creatures you haven't met yet.

07:10.520 --> 07:12.040
[both panting]

07:12.040 --> 07:13.120
[Doctor] Hi there.

07:13.120 --> 07:14.280
- [snarls]
- [both scream]

07:14.280 --> 07:15.600
- Oh, run, run!
- Run? Run!

07:15.600 --> 07:16.920
[creature roars]

07:17.560 --> 07:19.600
- [Ruby screams]
- Run, run, run!

07:20.160 --> 07:22.160
- [Ruby screaming]
- Go! Come on! Run!

07:22.160 --> 07:23.400
Come on!

07:24.320 --> 07:26.120
Go on! Come, come!

07:26.120 --> 07:28.000
Get in! Get in! Get in! Get in!

07:28.000 --> 07:29.680
[creature screeches]

07:29.680 --> 07:31.880
[both screaming]

07:31.880 --> 07:34.600
[groaning, panting]

07:35.120 --> 07:36.160
Oh, yeah.

07:38.560 --> 07:40.080
- [huffs, gasps]
- [Ruby gasps]

07:40.760 --> 07:43.240
The question is why did I run?

07:43.240 --> 07:44.560
[Ruby pants]

07:44.560 --> 07:45.960
'Cause it was scary.

07:45.960 --> 07:47.360
It was new.

07:47.360 --> 07:49.560
I love meeting new things.

07:49.560 --> 07:51.680
So why did it give me the shivers?

07:51.680 --> 07:52.760
[heartbeat thumping]

07:52.760 --> 07:55.120
I couldn't run fast enough.
I was like "whoosh".

07:55.120 --> 07:57.600
Well, i-it'd help
if we knew where we were.

07:57.600 --> 08:00.920
Yet again, push the button.

08:00.920 --> 08:02.000
[chuckles]

08:02.600 --> 08:03.680
[beeps]

08:05.640 --> 08:06.880
[gasps]

08:09.480 --> 08:11.160
[exclaiming]

08:11.160 --> 08:13.360
Oh, we're on a baby farm.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.160
[laughs]

08:15.160 --> 08:16.880
Oh, a parthenogenesis machine.

08:16.880 --> 08:19.520
What is it with you and babies?

08:19.520 --> 08:21.280
I was gonna say the same thing to you.

08:21.280 --> 08:22.840
We've gone from baby to baby.

08:23.800 --> 08:28.080
I'm not saying things are connected,
and yet, things connect. [chuckles]

08:28.080 --> 08:30.600
Well, I'm the one looking for my parents.

08:30.600 --> 08:33.840
- And you've got a time and space machine.
- [chuckles]

08:34.800 --> 08:38.120
So, this place grows babies. What for?

08:38.120 --> 08:40.760
- Food?
- Foo-- Wha-What?

08:41.440 --> 08:42.920
Food? They're not tomatoes.

08:42.920 --> 08:45.240
Well, excuse me.
There's a big, hungry thing downstairs.

08:45.240 --> 08:46.840
Baby farms boost the population.

08:46.840 --> 08:48.680
Sometimes a world goes sterile

08:48.680 --> 08:51.640
or, I don't know,
goes mad and bans kissing.

08:51.640 --> 08:54.160
[Ruby] So these babies are human, yeah?

08:54.160 --> 08:55.840
Yep. Grown for a colony world.

08:55.840 --> 08:58.520
- And a colony world is not Earth?
- [control panel beeps]

08:58.520 --> 09:01.760
Okay. Okay, one last time.

09:02.240 --> 09:04.000
Push the button.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.280
[control panel beeps]

09:13.400 --> 09:14.400
[gasps]

09:16.240 --> 09:17.720
[gasps, chuckles]

09:19.320 --> 09:20.320
We made it.

09:21.080 --> 09:23.280
The human race, we survived.

09:23.280 --> 09:25.920
[sighs]

09:25.920 --> 09:27.920
[smacks lips] We went to the stars.

09:29.560 --> 09:30.720
[chuckles]

09:33.280 --> 09:37.600
And ten minutes ago, Doctor,
just ten minutes ago,

09:37.600 --> 09:39.640
you said genocide.

09:41.560 --> 09:42.560
[inhales sharply]

09:42.560 --> 09:45.280
- Your people are gone.
- [Doctor] Yeah.

09:48.400 --> 09:52.080
- How do you keep going?
- For days like this, Ruby Sunday.

09:54.400 --> 09:56.400
I don't have a people.
I don't have a home.

09:58.320 --> 09:59.840
But I don't have a job either.

10:01.240 --> 10:04.440
I don't have a boss, or taxes,
or rent, or bills to pay.

10:04.440 --> 10:07.800
I don't have a purpose,
or a cause, or a mission,

10:07.800 --> 10:11.040
but I have freedom.

10:12.520 --> 10:14.000
That's why I keep moving on.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.200
To see the next thing,

10:16.200 --> 10:18.120
and the next, and the next.

10:20.640 --> 10:25.400
And sometimes it looks even better
through your eyes.

10:26.000 --> 10:27.600
- [chuckles]
- [Ruby chuckles]

10:28.120 --> 10:29.120
So where's this then?

10:29.120 --> 10:30.400
Oh, uh...

10:30.400 --> 10:31.800
[display beeps]

10:32.320 --> 10:33.320
Huh.

10:33.320 --> 10:35.600
The planet Pacifico del Rio.

10:35.600 --> 10:37.400
Oh, that's in English.

10:37.400 --> 10:39.240
They speak English here? English exists?

10:39.240 --> 10:41.800
Uh, no. No, no. Humans all speak
one language by this point.

10:41.800 --> 10:42.920
- A bit like Cantonese.
- Oh.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.280
- Uh, this...
- [display beeps]

10:44.280 --> 10:45.480
...is what it really looks like.

10:45.480 --> 10:47.760
But the TARDIS translates.
It's got a perception filter.

10:47.760 --> 10:51.360
So it helps you fit into
every time and place.

10:51.880 --> 10:55.880
- [display beeps]
- Right, and my mum, she's long gone now?

10:56.800 --> 10:57.960
Can I see your phone?

10:58.640 --> 10:59.640
Yes.

11:02.160 --> 11:03.840
So, my sonic screwdriver can make

11:03.840 --> 11:07.320
the distance between you
and Earth 19,000 years...

11:07.840 --> 11:09.080
[screwdriver whirrs]

11:09.720 --> 11:11.680
[sighs] ...or one phone call.

11:13.280 --> 11:15.200
- [smacks lips] What?
- Carla. Phone her.

11:15.200 --> 11:17.800
- But--
- Your mum, Ruby. Call your mum.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.960
[phone ringing]

11:23.640 --> 11:25.960
[Carla sighs] <i>Well? What is it now?</i>

11:25.960 --> 11:27.120
Mum?

11:27.120 --> 11:28.800
Yes, Mum, obviously.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.960
<i>You've just ran out the door
ten seconds ago.</i>

11:30.960 --> 11:32.120
<i>Why are you phoning me?</i>

11:32.120 --> 11:33.880
You went like the wind.
Where were you going?

11:33.880 --> 11:36.680
Yeah, yes. I will-- [stammers]
I'll catch up with you in a minute.

11:36.680 --> 11:38.000
<i>Bye. I love you, I love you.</i>

11:38.000 --> 11:39.280
- [sighs]
- [Ruby] <i>Merry Christmas.</i>

11:39.280 --> 11:40.360
That was my mum.

11:40.360 --> 11:43.520
On Christmas Eve. On my birthday.
Ten minutes ago.

11:43.520 --> 11:45.640
That's the best signal ever.
How much did that cost?

11:45.640 --> 11:48.560
I want to know what the hell is wrong
with this place.

11:48.560 --> 11:50.680
- [screen beeps]
- [air hisses]

11:51.320 --> 11:53.240
- [Ruby] Ooh.
- Do you see?

11:54.000 --> 11:57.040
It's calm up here,
but underneath it is seething,

11:57.040 --> 11:58.960
just like downstairs with that creature.

11:59.480 --> 12:02.480
There's gotta be a-a crew or a captain--

12:02.480 --> 12:05.360
[baby 1] This is Eric
reporting from Birth Zone 6.

12:05.360 --> 12:07.560
I keep getting
these temperature fluctuations.

12:07.560 --> 12:10.480
I've opened up safety valves ten to 16.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.920
I've tried cross-matching
with the CO2 exchange.

12:12.920 --> 12:15.680
But until we get that pressure down,
I can't--

12:17.400 --> 12:18.720
[Doctor] Hi.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.200
You all right?

12:21.200 --> 12:24.040
But-- You. Oh.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.200
We've been waiting
for an awfully long time.

12:28.720 --> 12:30.240
Mummy! Daddy!

12:30.240 --> 12:32.560
- Oh, no. No, no!
- Darling, we're not--

12:32.560 --> 12:33.640
[Eric] Boys, oh, boys!

12:33.640 --> 12:35.000
I've got to tell everybody.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.160
Mummy and Daddy are here!

12:36.160 --> 12:37.480
[horn honks]

12:37.480 --> 12:40.200
A baby farm run by babies.

12:40.200 --> 12:42.520
[laughs] Space babies!

12:42.520 --> 12:43.840
[laughs]

12:46.520 --> 12:48.000
[horn honks]

12:54.440 --> 12:55.600
They're here!

12:55.600 --> 12:57.160
They came at last!

12:57.160 --> 12:58.560
Mummy and Daddy are here!

12:58.560 --> 13:02.040
[babies cheering] Daddy! Mummy!

13:02.760 --> 13:04.040
[baby 2] You came back!

13:04.640 --> 13:05.960
[bell tinkles]

13:09.440 --> 13:10.600
[Doctor chuckles]

13:10.600 --> 13:13.560
- Hello, space babies.
- [Ruby] Hello. [chuckles]

13:13.560 --> 13:15.480
- Hello, Daddy.
- Hi, Daddy.

13:15.480 --> 13:17.280
- Hey, Daddy.
- [baby 3] Hello, Daddy.

13:17.280 --> 13:18.760
Oh.

13:18.760 --> 13:20.200
Everyone, back to work.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.640
Show Mummy and Daddy
what a good job we've been doing.

13:22.640 --> 13:24.240
Make them proud.

13:25.920 --> 13:27.560
[buttons beeping]

13:28.160 --> 13:30.240
My job is to keep the pipes clean.

13:30.240 --> 13:32.080
I am proud of the pipes.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.680
And I keep the oxygen nice and cool.

13:34.680 --> 13:36.640
We need oxygen to breathe.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.200
And I pull this string and that string.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.120
[controls beep]

13:40.120 --> 13:42.800
I'm not sure what they do,
but I pull them very hard.

13:42.800 --> 13:45.280
And I made this for you.
It is a little flower.

13:46.080 --> 13:48.720
Thank you. [chuckles]

13:53.240 --> 13:54.640
- I'm Captain Poppy.
- [gasps]

13:54.640 --> 13:57.720
And I kept the station running
for Mummy and Daddy.

13:57.720 --> 14:00.720
Because we knew
you'd come back for us one day.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.000
We waited.

14:02.680 --> 14:07.120
Right, you're not supposed to be running
this place. This isn't Babyworld.

14:07.120 --> 14:11.240
Huh? You got left behind
when the adults vamoosed?

14:11.240 --> 14:12.920
We took over.

14:12.920 --> 14:14.240
We were very brave.

14:15.200 --> 14:16.200
Right.

14:17.240 --> 14:19.560
That's great. That's, uh-- That's good.

14:19.560 --> 14:20.640
That's amazing.

14:20.640 --> 14:22.880
You've done a really great job.

14:22.880 --> 14:24.720
[Doctor] I'm sorry, Poppy. I'm so sorry.

14:24.720 --> 14:27.360
But we are not your mummy and daddy.

14:27.360 --> 14:29.160
I wish we were.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.240
But we're not.

14:30.240 --> 14:31.520
[Eric] They left us.

14:31.520 --> 14:32.880
Where did they go?

14:33.560 --> 14:35.080
I don't know, darling.

14:35.760 --> 14:38.560
But I'm Ruby.

14:38.560 --> 14:42.800
And this-- this is the Doctor.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.320
And we're your friends.

14:46.080 --> 14:47.520
- Okay. Yeah, I got you.
- [coos]

14:47.520 --> 14:50.200
I got you, I got you, I got you.

14:50.200 --> 14:51.320
And me.

14:51.320 --> 14:53.440
[babies] And me.

14:53.440 --> 14:54.680
[Doctor] Oh, gosh.

14:54.680 --> 14:56.160
[babies] And me.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.720
And me.

14:57.720 --> 15:00.120
Captain Poppy,
when was the last time that you had a hug?

15:00.120 --> 15:01.520
Never.

15:01.520 --> 15:04.360
Aw. Oh, baby, it's okay.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.840
Come here.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay. [shushes]

15:07.840 --> 15:09.360
- Oh, never had a hug?
- [Eric whimpers]

15:09.360 --> 15:12.280
- [Ruby] Come on. You can all have a hug.
- [Doctor shushes]

15:27.920 --> 15:29.520
[babies coo, chatter]

15:29.520 --> 15:32.400
- Did I get things wrong, Doctor?
- [controls beeping]

15:32.400 --> 15:36.800
Well, according to this,
the crew went home.

15:36.800 --> 15:39.320
They abandoned ship,
and they left you guys behind.

15:39.320 --> 15:42.760
I don't know why,
but they left the birth machine running.

15:43.360 --> 15:45.960
So you lot grew up,
but you stayed the same size.

15:46.720 --> 15:48.240
Baby size. Space babies.

15:48.240 --> 15:49.880
But are we wrong?

15:52.000 --> 15:54.720
- What do you mean?
- We're not meant to be like this.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.520
Did we grow up wrong?

15:57.520 --> 15:58.920
Oh, Poppy.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.800
Oh, Popsicle.

16:02.320 --> 16:03.840
Look at me. Look at me.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.480
Nobody grows up wrong.

16:08.680 --> 16:12.640
You are what you are,
and that is magnificent.

16:12.640 --> 16:14.640
But Mummy and Daddy left us.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.880
That's okay. Mine did too.

16:16.880 --> 16:18.360
What happened?

16:18.360 --> 16:19.720
Well, I was found.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.160
Hooray!

16:21.160 --> 16:27.480
Yeah, little baby me was left alone
in the middle of outer space.

16:27.480 --> 16:29.760
- And guess who took me in.
- I don't know.

16:29.760 --> 16:32.440
- The Time Lords.
- Ooh.

16:32.440 --> 16:33.600
Can you say it like me?

16:33.600 --> 16:35.240
- The Time Lords.
- That's it.

16:35.240 --> 16:39.760
[stammers] But the point is, is that it
doesn't matter where I come from,

16:39.760 --> 16:43.960
because I am absolutely lovely, aren't I?

16:44.800 --> 16:45.720
[yawns]

16:45.720 --> 16:48.920
- That wasn't rhetorical, Pops.
- Yes, you are.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.840
And do you wanna know my secret?

16:52.440 --> 16:56.280
There's no one like me
in the whole wide universe.

16:56.280 --> 16:59.560
No one like me exists,
and that's true of everyone.

17:00.760 --> 17:03.000
It's not a problem, Captain Pops.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.320
It's a superpower.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.720
- High five.
- Yeah.

17:07.720 --> 17:09.800
- Yeah!
- So you're Eric.

17:10.400 --> 17:15.840
And you're Tasha, and Ruben,
and then there's Saltine and Boo.

17:16.360 --> 17:17.440
I love you, Ruby.

17:17.440 --> 17:20.360
Oh, I love you too, Eric.

17:20.360 --> 17:23.920
But how do you manage all on your own?

17:23.920 --> 17:25.480
We've got Nan-E.

17:25.480 --> 17:26.640
Say hello, Nan-E.

17:26.640 --> 17:30.200
[Nan-E] <i>Good afternoon, children.
And welcome to our new visitors.</i>

17:30.200 --> 17:32.600
Oh, nanomatrix electroform.

17:32.600 --> 17:34.320
Nan-E. Right.

17:34.320 --> 17:38.040
Uh, hi, Nan-E.
I'm the Doctor, and-and this is Ruby.

17:38.040 --> 17:40.080
[Nan-E] <i>We have visitors, children.</i>

17:40.080 --> 17:41.880
- Nan-E!
- <i>Noses must be blown.</i>

17:41.880 --> 17:44.640
<i>Activate nose blow.</i>

17:44.640 --> 17:46.040
- [beeps]
- Uh...

17:48.280 --> 17:50.920
[Nan-E] <i>One, two, three, and...</i>

17:50.920 --> 17:54.320
[machinery whirring, beeping]

17:54.320 --> 17:55.400
[Nan-E] <i>...blow.</i>

17:55.400 --> 17:57.480
- [babies blowing noses]
- Oh!

17:58.920 --> 17:59.920
[coos]

18:00.840 --> 18:02.600
- [sucks]
- [both laughing]

18:02.600 --> 18:04.440
- [Nan-E] <i>Well done, children.</i>
- [chuckles]

18:04.440 --> 18:06.760
<i>And now, children, back to work.</i>

18:06.760 --> 18:09.280
<i>Nappies are changed at 1800 hours.</i>

18:09.280 --> 18:11.640
- [smacks lips] Oh, can't wait to see that.
- Right.

18:11.640 --> 18:13.800
So, uh, it's-it's-it's you lot.

18:13.800 --> 18:15.320
It's Nan-E.

18:15.320 --> 18:18.520
And downstairs, is that your pet dog?

18:18.520 --> 18:21.440
[babies screaming, crying]

18:21.440 --> 18:22.720
That's not a doggo.

18:22.720 --> 18:25.200
- [shushes] It's okay, it's okay.
- What is it then, Eric?

18:25.800 --> 18:26.720
The Bogeyman.

18:27.600 --> 18:30.200
- [babies clamouring]
- [Ruby shushes]

18:32.040 --> 18:33.640
[Doctor] Oh, gosh. Oh.

18:33.640 --> 18:36.520
- We don't like the Bogeyman.
- Oh, no, no, no, no. [shushes]

18:36.520 --> 18:38.720
I did not mean to scare you.

18:38.720 --> 18:41.520
There is no such thing as the Bogeyman.

18:41.520 --> 18:45.680
That thing was more-- Sort of like a, uh--

18:45.680 --> 18:47.480
- Bogeyman!
- [babies crying]

18:47.480 --> 18:49.120
- [Ruby] No, no, no, stop it!
- [laughing]

18:49.120 --> 18:52.200
Nan-E, you tell them
there is no such thing as the Bogeyman.

18:52.200 --> 18:55.480
[Nan-E] <i>Nan-E is scared of the Bogeyman.</i>

18:55.480 --> 18:57.480
Then what is the Bogeyman
doing down there,

18:57.480 --> 19:00.720
- and why-- why is it so scary?
- [controls beep]

19:00.720 --> 19:02.000
[roars]

19:02.000 --> 19:03.720
[Ruby] Doctor, turn it off!

19:03.720 --> 19:04.800
[babies crying]

19:04.800 --> 19:06.920
- Listen to me, babies. Come on.
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.640
I'm sorry, babies. Space babies.

19:08.640 --> 19:10.000
You're fine. You're fine.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.560
- [Poppy] Oh, Ruby.
- [Ruby] Come on.

19:11.560 --> 19:13.800
- [babies crying]
- [Ruby shushes]

19:21.080 --> 19:22.200
Right.

19:22.200 --> 19:26.160
Nan-E, these babies
are trying their best-- space babies--

19:26.160 --> 19:27.800
but this station is in trouble.

19:27.800 --> 19:30.200
You have got a build-up of pressure
in Hull-3-B,

19:30.200 --> 19:32.640
and something is ramping up
down where the Bogeyman lives.

19:32.640 --> 19:35.400
And if that continues, baby boom.

19:35.400 --> 19:38.240
- [Nan-E] <i>Portal 3-5-7.</i>
- Okay, what's that?

19:38.240 --> 19:41.240
[Nan-E] <i>Access portal 3-5-7.</i>

19:41.240 --> 19:43.080
That's on this floor. What is it?

19:43.080 --> 19:45.080
[Nan-E] <i>Access portal 3-5-7.</i>

19:45.080 --> 19:48.320
Yes, it is just a storage unit.
What would I need to go there for?

19:48.320 --> 19:51.640
[Nan-E] <i>Oh, for God sakes. 3-5-7, come on!</i>

19:52.800 --> 19:53.960
[gasps]

19:55.760 --> 19:57.360
Where do you think you're going?

19:57.360 --> 19:59.040
Portal 3-5-7. [laughs]

19:59.760 --> 20:02.320
Now? Great. Okay. Coming.

20:02.320 --> 20:04.800
So, is this what you do, Doctor?

20:04.800 --> 20:07.280
I mean, in life? You help?

20:07.280 --> 20:09.160
- That's, like, your purpose?
- No, no.

20:09.160 --> 20:12.280
I'm just, uh, helping babies.
Space babies.

20:12.280 --> 20:13.640
Ha! Listening to my hearts.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.320
Two hearts. Plural.

20:16.600 --> 20:18.240
Okay. Two hearts.

20:18.240 --> 20:21.840
But what if helping the babies
takes six weeks or ten years?

20:21.840 --> 20:24.320
Because my mum's still waiting for me.

20:25.280 --> 20:28.200
Back home on your birthday.

20:28.200 --> 20:30.160
Yeah. It's strange, your life.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.800
You were abandoned like this lot. Uh--

20:32.800 --> 20:36.760
If things connect,
then you are connecting like crazy.

20:37.680 --> 20:38.760
[sighs]

20:38.760 --> 20:42.160
You don't know anything
about your birth mother or your father?

20:42.160 --> 20:43.760
They didn't leave a-a note?

20:43.760 --> 20:45.000
Or scrap of paper?

20:45.000 --> 20:48.960
Nothing. I was-- I was just left.

20:49.760 --> 20:51.600
- By the church?
- In the snow. [chuckles]

20:51.600 --> 20:53.040
On Ruby Road.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.720
[Ruby] Doctor.

21:15.240 --> 21:17.640
What? [shudders]

21:17.640 --> 21:19.280
[breathes shakily] It's snowing.

21:23.120 --> 21:24.280
Okay, what just happened?

21:24.280 --> 21:28.280
I said snow, and we've got...
[scoffs] ...snowflakes.

21:33.160 --> 21:34.920
It's like a memory just came through.

21:36.800 --> 21:38.760
From the day that you were born.

21:40.200 --> 21:43.440
But how? Is this the sort of thing
that happens with time travel?

21:43.440 --> 21:46.120
- [inhales deeply]
- I have been to the ends of time and back,

21:46.120 --> 21:49.200
and I have never seen
anything like this before.

21:51.680 --> 21:53.000
Then what does it mean?

21:53.520 --> 21:55.800
- [breathing heavily]
- I don't know.

21:55.800 --> 21:58.240
[Ruby sighing]

21:58.240 --> 22:00.120
[both laughing]

22:00.120 --> 22:03.320
- Oh, I thought my birth was crazy.
- Oh, yeah, I know.

22:03.320 --> 22:05.840
- Oh.
- [Ruby laughs, sniffles]

22:11.280 --> 22:14.040
I wonder who she is. Your mother.

22:15.160 --> 22:18.200
The memory changed.
She was pointing at me.

22:18.200 --> 22:21.600
- [door opens]
- I said portal 3-5-7.

22:21.600 --> 22:24.600
Don't just stand there yapping,
you pair of idiots. Get inside!

22:26.440 --> 22:28.240
- Who's she?
- Nan-E.

22:28.240 --> 22:30.200
- Ha!
- Oh.

22:30.200 --> 22:34.520
<i>This is Captain Rico Trieste,
signing off duty from Baby Station Beta.</i>

22:34.520 --> 22:38.320
<i>Pacifico date 56-56-22.</i>

22:38.320 --> 22:40.920
<i>For the record,
I'm signing off under protest</i>

22:40.920 --> 22:42.640
<i>and wish to condemn this course of action.</i>

22:42.640 --> 22:44.200
<i>Chief Engineer Lucia Colasanto.</i>

22:44.200 --> 22:46.720
<i>Signing off 56-56-22.</i>

22:46.720 --> 22:49.960
<i>And I'd like to say for the record,
the company's actions are appalling.</i>

22:49.960 --> 22:52.840
<i>I will be launching an appeal against this
as soon as we're home.</i>

22:52.840 --> 22:54.520
- [air hissing]
- [gasps]

22:55.880 --> 22:56.960
- [Doctor] Oof.
- [sighs]

22:56.960 --> 22:59.520
- [alarm blaring on computer]
- <i>This is Comms Officer Gina Scalzi</i>

22:59.520 --> 23:02.240
<i>signing off, 56-56-22.</i>

23:02.240 --> 23:06.240
So, the crew went home
and left the babies behind-- Space babies.

23:06.240 --> 23:07.360
[Nan-E] It's the recession.

23:07.360 --> 23:09.520
The government closed
the baby station to save money,

23:09.520 --> 23:12.680
but the law says it's illegal
to stop the birth machine.

23:12.680 --> 23:14.240
- [Doctor] Whoa!
- [Nan-E grunts]

23:16.040 --> 23:17.560
But how did you arrive?

23:18.720 --> 23:21.280
- Have you got a way out of here?
- I've got a ship, yeah.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.360
[stammers] Um.

23:22.360 --> 23:24.160
[stammers] What is your name?
Sorry, Nan-E.

23:24.160 --> 23:26.680
Oh. Jocelyn.

23:26.680 --> 23:29.240
Jocelyn Sancerre.
I was the on-site accountant.

23:29.240 --> 23:31.160
I don't know how this place works.

23:31.160 --> 23:34.040
Jocelyn, wait. Hold on, hold on, hold on.
This-- This can help.

23:34.040 --> 23:36.400
If you leave this to sync up...

23:36.400 --> 23:37.720
[the sonic beeps]

23:37.720 --> 23:39.840
...that should recalibrate
the whole shebang.

23:39.840 --> 23:41.920
- [Jocelyn gasps] Thank you.
- [Doctor chuckles]

23:41.920 --> 23:43.000
Wanna swap?

23:44.080 --> 23:45.680
- [chuckles]
- Hang on.

23:45.680 --> 23:51.720
So, the planet down below
will refuse to stop the babies being born,

23:51.720 --> 23:54.040
but once they're born,
they don't look after them?

23:54.680 --> 23:56.080
It's a very strange planet.

23:56.680 --> 23:59.000
[scoffs] It's not that strange.

23:59.600 --> 24:00.840
But you stayed behind.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.440
I couldn't leave them.

24:03.360 --> 24:06.920
And I tried with this place,
but I'm not an engineer.

24:06.920 --> 24:09.000
The machine went out of sync.
I patched it back,

24:09.720 --> 24:12.520
but then the education software
ran out of control. It's a mess.

24:14.360 --> 24:17.400
And I've been all on my own,
watching the kids for six years.

24:17.400 --> 24:20.200
But I don't understand. They are gorgeous.

24:20.200 --> 24:21.320
Why would you hide?

24:24.280 --> 24:26.000
'Cause I don't wanna see them die.

24:31.280 --> 24:33.080
And I don't want them to see me die.

24:36.360 --> 24:37.760
'Cause that's how bad it is.

24:39.080 --> 24:41.480
This is a closed station.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.680
There's only so much air.
There's only so much food.

24:48.760 --> 24:53.200
The last thing I'll do
is give them the air out of portal 3-5-7.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.360
But then--

24:56.080 --> 24:57.520
then you came along.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.880
Can't you fly somewhere else?

25:02.280 --> 25:05.240
- What do you mean, "fly"?
- Uh, space station's stationary.

25:06.120 --> 25:09.040
No engines.
This great big thing can't move.

25:09.040 --> 25:14.560
It's just stuck in orbit, which is a shame
because this is a nice little system.

25:15.400 --> 25:17.280
[Jocelyn] The fifth planet out,
Mondo Caroon.

25:17.280 --> 25:18.960
- [Doctor] Uh...
- That's a DuBarryDuPlessy world.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.600
Oh, th-that's good.

25:20.600 --> 25:23.280
D-DuBarryDuPlessy
is a starwide organisation.

25:23.280 --> 25:25.440
- It means it can take in lots of refugees.
- Oh!

25:25.440 --> 25:27.560
Well-Well, can't we call them for help?

25:27.560 --> 25:29.480
They don't go fetch refugees.

25:30.240 --> 25:33.360
That's the fate of every refugee
in the universe.

25:33.920 --> 25:37.160
You physically have to turn up
on someone else's shore.

25:38.440 --> 25:40.640
- And we can't move.
- But now you have a ship.

25:40.640 --> 25:42.880
Plenty of room. It's called the TARDIS.

25:42.880 --> 25:49.520
The trouble is, between us and the ship
is the Bogeyman.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.840
- [roars]
- What is that thing?

25:52.880 --> 25:54.000
[both] You don't know?

25:54.000 --> 25:56.440
It's nothing to do with me.
It's not part of the manifest.

25:56.440 --> 25:58.520
It's not like anything I've ever seen.

26:00.560 --> 26:01.720
No, nor me.

26:02.480 --> 26:05.440
But it reminds me of something.
What is it?

26:05.440 --> 26:11.000
And what is its skin made of,
and why was I so scared?

26:11.000 --> 26:12.200
Because it's terrifying.

26:12.200 --> 26:13.800
Yeah, but I've met a million ugly bugs.

26:13.800 --> 26:14.880
I'm an ugly bug.

26:14.880 --> 26:19.280
That thing made me run,
and I just wonder why. [sniffles]

26:21.520 --> 26:22.520
Okay.

26:22.520 --> 26:27.520
The thing is this place is completely...
[laughs] ...mad, but it sort of makes sense.

26:27.520 --> 26:30.120
Because you've got babies,
you've got a nanny,

26:31.280 --> 26:32.520
and you've got the Bogeyman.

26:33.440 --> 26:35.840
You've literally got a monster
living down below.

26:37.080 --> 26:41.080
It's a children's story come to life.

26:42.720 --> 26:45.680
And every story has its hero.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.800
[Ruby] That's Eric! Is-Is that Eric?

26:51.800 --> 26:53.400
Eric, get outta there.

26:53.400 --> 26:55.720
[Nan-E] <i>Eric, please vacate this area.</i>

26:55.720 --> 26:58.120
- Oh, is that how it works?
- Nanny filter.

26:58.120 --> 27:00.440
Eric, get out, now!

27:00.440 --> 27:02.760
[Nan-E] <i>Eric will leave immediately.</i>

27:03.280 --> 27:04.960
No, Nan-E. I'm being brave.

27:06.160 --> 27:07.840
[Jocelyn gasps]

27:07.840 --> 27:09.200
[roars]

27:09.200 --> 27:11.520
Eric, for God sakes. Run!

27:11.520 --> 27:15.720
[Nan-E] <i>Eric, invoking the deity.
Accelerate perambulation.</i>

27:15.720 --> 27:17.320
But I'm doing what Ruby said.

27:18.480 --> 27:19.680
What?

27:19.680 --> 27:22.680
I love Ruby, and she said
there's no such thing as the Bogeyman.

27:22.680 --> 27:25.640
So I'm going to find the naughty doggo
and tell him off.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.400
- [roaring]
- [both gasp]

27:28.920 --> 27:30.000
[roars]

27:31.880 --> 27:33.560
But I'm so scared.

27:33.560 --> 27:35.720
[creature screeches]

27:35.720 --> 27:36.800
Oh, my God!

27:36.800 --> 27:38.280
It's my fault!

27:38.280 --> 27:40.680
[panting]

27:44.280 --> 27:47.440
Eric, I'm coming, I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming!

27:47.440 --> 27:49.120
- [beeps]
- [lift doors close]

27:52.600 --> 27:55.640
[gasps] No, no, no, no, no.

27:56.480 --> 27:57.520
[gasps]

27:58.720 --> 28:00.520
[creature roars]

28:00.520 --> 28:01.720
Nan-E, where's the Bogeyman?

28:01.720 --> 28:03.720
It's about 400 metres north-west of you.

28:03.720 --> 28:06.120
But still no sign of Eric.

28:06.120 --> 28:09.920
Can't get a proper fix.
I told you these systems are a crock of--

28:09.920 --> 28:11.200
[Nan-E] <i>...waste products.</i>

28:11.200 --> 28:13.440
Mind your language, Nan-E.

28:14.880 --> 28:17.360
[Ruby] Okay, Doctor,
if we make a ton of noise,

28:17.360 --> 28:20.680
then the Bogeyman will come for us
and leave Eric alone, yes?

28:20.680 --> 28:24.240
- Yes? Okay, right. Yes.
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

28:24.240 --> 28:27.400
- Bogeyman! Bogeyman! Come get us!
- Bogeyman!

28:27.400 --> 28:29.120
- [both] Bogeyman!
- [pipe banging walls]

28:29.120 --> 28:30.840
Bogeyman!

28:30.840 --> 28:32.520
[roaring]

28:32.520 --> 28:34.320
It's moving. It's heard you!

28:36.560 --> 28:38.640
Okay. Nice plan, but what now?

28:39.240 --> 28:40.520
[Doctor] I think...

28:40.520 --> 28:41.600
[sniffing]

28:41.600 --> 28:45.200
...if I was very, very little,
and I knew the Bogeyman was coming...

28:45.200 --> 28:47.640
[sniffing]

28:47.640 --> 28:49.680
...I would need to change my nappy.

28:50.320 --> 28:51.760
Because I can detect...

28:51.760 --> 28:53.120
[Ruby gasps]

28:53.120 --> 28:54.840
...space baby!

28:54.840 --> 28:57.040
- [Ruby shrieks, laughs]
- Oh, Eric!

28:57.040 --> 28:59.800
- [Ruby shushes] We got you.
- [Eric] I was scared.

28:59.800 --> 29:02.640
- It's okay.
- [shushes] Yeah, I know, I know.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.040
[snarling]

29:04.040 --> 29:05.560
Not west, I meant east!

29:05.560 --> 29:07.640
- [Ruby screams]
- [roaring]

29:08.760 --> 29:10.320
Go, go! Go.

29:10.320 --> 29:12.200
- [Ruby whimpers]
- It's all right, it's all right.

29:12.200 --> 29:13.640
[roaring continues]

29:13.640 --> 29:15.560
- [Eric crying]
- It's all right. It's all right.

29:15.560 --> 29:18.280
- You're all right. You're all right.
- [Eric whimpers]

29:23.920 --> 29:25.880
- [Eric cries]
- It's all right.

29:30.960 --> 29:32.240
[screeches]

29:32.240 --> 29:33.440
- [crying continues]
- [shushes]

29:33.440 --> 29:34.800
It's okay. It's okay.

29:34.800 --> 29:37.280
[breathing heavily]

29:37.280 --> 29:38.360
All right.

29:38.360 --> 29:39.840
[shushes]

29:41.760 --> 29:43.240
[growls]

29:47.480 --> 29:49.640
[growls]

29:59.120 --> 30:03.240
[screeches, roaring]

30:03.240 --> 30:04.440
[Ruby screams]

30:04.440 --> 30:06.080
Don't you touch them, you...

30:06.080 --> 30:07.880
[Nan-E] <i>...illegitimate person.</i>

30:07.880 --> 30:09.600
[Doctor] Go! Go, go!

30:09.600 --> 30:11.720
- [Ruby whimpers]
- [Doctor] It's a dead end!

30:11.720 --> 30:13.360
- [snarling]
- [Ruby] It's okay. It's okay.

30:13.360 --> 30:14.840
- [snarls]
- You're okay.

30:16.760 --> 30:17.880
[screeching]

30:19.960 --> 30:21.640
Babies to the rescue!

30:21.640 --> 30:23.960
[creature screeches, growls]

30:26.680 --> 30:27.680
[chuckles]

30:27.680 --> 30:28.840
- Space babies!
- [Ruby laughs]

30:28.840 --> 30:32.440
- [Doctor laughing]
- Uh, babies with a flamethrower?

30:32.440 --> 30:33.640
[Ruby, Doctor laughs]

30:33.640 --> 30:36.000
Babies, babies, babies, you did brilliant!

30:36.000 --> 30:37.280
You did so great!

30:37.280 --> 30:39.200
[Ruby, Doctor laughing]

30:39.200 --> 30:41.240
Space babies, you need to go, okay?

30:41.240 --> 30:42.400
Get-Get out of here.

30:43.000 --> 30:44.080
[whistles]

30:48.880 --> 30:50.640
Okay, let's get you in here. Come on.

30:50.640 --> 30:53.760
[Doctor] Let's get you in here.
They're so good. Yeah, they're so good.

30:53.760 --> 30:55.960
Nan-E, tell 'em what to do.

30:55.960 --> 31:00.520
[Nan-E] <i>Children will return to the
upper levels or have no expletive dinner.</i>

31:00.520 --> 31:02.840
[babies] Bye!

31:03.840 --> 31:06.240
- [sighs]
- Okay, uh, you-you go with them.

31:06.240 --> 31:08.560
I've gotta stay here--
not just for the TARDIS--

31:08.560 --> 31:11.640
but I've got to find out
what that thing is.

31:11.640 --> 31:15.160
If that's you telling me
to leave you on your own, then...

31:15.720 --> 31:16.880
[laughs]

31:16.880 --> 31:18.320
Oh, Doctor.

31:20.440 --> 31:21.520
Well, come on.

31:22.880 --> 31:24.680
[laughs]

31:28.480 --> 31:29.560
Ooh.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.680
[Ruby groans]

31:32.680 --> 31:36.040
[Doctor groans]
So how did this begin, Jocelyn?

31:36.800 --> 31:39.040
[Jocelyn] First I knew, six years ago,

31:40.080 --> 31:41.640
was like a rattling in the pipes.

31:44.040 --> 31:45.520
Then the howling began.

31:46.440 --> 31:49.200
By the time I got the cameras working,
there it was.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.240
The Bogeyman.

31:53.760 --> 31:56.000
I don't know how it even exists.

31:56.720 --> 31:58.720
And that was six years ago?

31:59.280 --> 32:00.560
- [stammers]
- [shushes]

32:00.560 --> 32:02.760
That's the same time the babies were born.

32:05.040 --> 32:06.960
- It's leaving...
- [electricity crackles]

32:08.840 --> 32:11.800
...some sort of spoor.

32:12.440 --> 32:14.240
Man, that's a good word. Spoor.

32:14.240 --> 32:17.240
[Nan-E] <i>What the bleep bleep is that?</i>

32:17.240 --> 32:19.160
Oh, Jocelyn, turn the filter off.

32:19.160 --> 32:20.720
What is that stuff?

32:20.720 --> 32:23.560
<i>If I could get this to your machine,
it could analyse it.</i>

32:23.560 --> 32:26.120
The machine's got a vent in the basement.

32:26.120 --> 32:29.240
Follow the corridor.
Left, straight ahead, left again.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.680
[Doctor] Into the belly of the beast.

32:35.120 --> 32:36.800
Yeah, this stuff is slippy, Rubes.

32:36.800 --> 32:38.120
- Be careful.
- [grunts]

32:40.160 --> 32:41.160
[grunts]

32:42.000 --> 32:44.240
Oh, my God. [grunts]

32:44.240 --> 32:45.880
Oh, this is disgusting!

32:45.880 --> 32:48.000
Don't call me Rubes!

32:49.240 --> 32:50.840
[groans]

32:50.840 --> 32:52.560
Are we almost there, Joss?

32:52.560 --> 32:55.240
- [Ruby groans, pants]
- [static on intercom]

32:55.760 --> 32:59.360
This gunk stuff is
sealing the whole place off.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.760
- [Ruby sighs]
- Oh, but never mind,

33:02.760 --> 33:07.160
because... [exclaims] ...we are right under
the parthenogenesis machine.

33:07.160 --> 33:08.240
[sighs]

33:08.240 --> 33:10.640
[Doctor] Now let's make
sense of this thing. Uh...

33:12.080 --> 33:13.720
According to the machine...

33:15.000 --> 33:16.360
Oh.

33:16.360 --> 33:17.920
[sighs] What?

33:17.920 --> 33:21.040
It has been right in front of us.
We've been saying it all along.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.400
It's all one machine.

33:23.040 --> 33:26.320
One up above and one down below.
The one up above grew the babies.

33:26.320 --> 33:28.080
- The one down below--
- It grew the Bogeyman.

33:28.080 --> 33:29.680
- Yes!
- I said this. I told you so.

33:29.680 --> 33:32.560
Six years ago-- The machine
is mother and father to the babies

33:32.560 --> 33:34.120
and mother and father to the Bogeyman.

33:34.120 --> 33:37.080
And why? Because Jocelyn said the
educational software ran out of control.

33:37.080 --> 33:38.960
- And then you said--
- Said it's like a story.

33:38.960 --> 33:40.800
The teaching software, it told a story.

33:40.800 --> 33:42.120
It invented the Bogeyman.

33:42.120 --> 33:44.360
- For the babies.
- For the space babies.

33:44.360 --> 33:46.840
Oh, the machine is literal.
Like a computer.

33:46.840 --> 33:49.360
It literally said babies need fiction.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.440
- They need stories. They need monsters.
- Yes.

33:51.440 --> 33:55.840
Yes, that is why I'm so scared.
It's all deliberate. It's infrasound.

33:55.840 --> 33:57.760
The Bogeyman is roaring at 17 hertz.

33:57.760 --> 34:00.600
That's the exact pitch
designed to make you scared.

34:00.600 --> 34:03.000
It's scary because it's meant to be.

34:03.000 --> 34:05.360
The machine made it
tall and big and noisy.

34:05.360 --> 34:07.560
And it built it out of...

34:13.760 --> 34:14.760
Oh.

34:18.240 --> 34:19.360
What?

34:19.360 --> 34:20.840
Oh, Ruby.

34:21.920 --> 34:23.200
- What?
- Oh, man.

34:23.960 --> 34:25.200
Tell me what it is.

34:25.200 --> 34:26.360
- I can't.
- Doctor.

34:26.360 --> 34:29.160
Ruby, I have travelled
the universe and back.

34:29.160 --> 34:34.080
And seen many, many things.
Nothing is as bad as this.

34:35.320 --> 34:37.680
A Bogeyman is made out of what?

34:37.680 --> 34:40.160
I don't know.

34:40.160 --> 34:43.600
The machine is literal.
And the name is Bogeyman.

34:44.640 --> 34:46.240
- So?
- Oh, babes.

34:46.240 --> 34:48.880
Space babes. We saw it. The nose blowing.

34:53.200 --> 34:54.680
The machine was literal.

34:54.680 --> 34:59.680
And so it grew the Bogeyman out of bogeys.

34:59.680 --> 35:02.240
- What?
- All of this is bogeys.

35:02.240 --> 35:04.560
- No. No. No.
- Yes. Yes.

35:04.560 --> 35:08.120
No wonder it was shedding its skin.
Doesn't everyone?

35:08.120 --> 35:10.680
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- [laughs] It's snot.

35:10.680 --> 35:14.800
- It's not.
- Oh, Ruby, it is a living sneeze.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.520
- But it's-- [stammers, gasps]
- I know.

35:16.520 --> 35:20.400
- [laughing]
- Oh, my God!

35:20.400 --> 35:25.520
This is the worst thing
that could ever happen to anyone!

35:25.520 --> 35:27.440
- Don't laugh!
- [laughing] I'm sorry.

35:27.440 --> 35:28.840
Oh, isn't the universe mad?

35:28.840 --> 35:30.720
Yeah, it just made a monster out of snot!

35:30.720 --> 35:33.400
[laughs] Ruby Sunday, Monday, Tuesday.

35:33.400 --> 35:35.000
- That is...
- [groans]

35:35.000 --> 35:36.160
...so funny.

35:36.160 --> 35:38.280
- [growls]
- Bogeyman.

35:38.280 --> 35:40.200
- [roars]
- Run. Run. Run!

35:40.200 --> 35:42.400
[Ruby] I'm running!
I'm running! I'm running!

35:42.400 --> 35:43.960
- [Doctor] Go!
- [Ruby shrieking]

35:44.560 --> 35:45.520
No, no, no, no, no, no!

35:46.840 --> 35:48.640
Don't worry. It's me. Turn right.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.520
- [screeches]
- [Doctor] Go, go, go, go!

35:50.520 --> 35:51.720
[roars]

35:51.720 --> 35:54.200
- [Jocelyn] It's your device.
- [screwdriver beeping]

35:54.200 --> 35:55.280
It's calibrated.

35:55.280 --> 35:57.560
It's brilliant. I've got control at last.

35:58.360 --> 36:00.120
Now trust me. Turn right.

36:01.680 --> 36:03.800
- This isn't the way to the lift!
- Keep going.

36:03.800 --> 36:05.480
- [Ruby screams]
- Come on! Come on!

36:05.480 --> 36:06.960
[Ruby] I'm coming! I'm coming!

36:07.920 --> 36:08.920
It's catching up!

36:08.920 --> 36:11.160
- Coming.
- [Doctor] Go. Go, go, go!

36:11.160 --> 36:14.000
- [creature hisses]
- [Ruby screams, groans]

36:14.000 --> 36:15.120
[laughs]

36:15.120 --> 36:16.800
Yeah, thanks for using us as bait!

36:16.800 --> 36:18.400
- Just next time, ask!
- Ooh!

36:18.400 --> 36:21.640
Oh, wait until we tell you
what that thing is made of!

36:22.240 --> 36:24.600
You can tell me later
once I've got rid of it.

36:25.400 --> 36:27.400
[roars]

36:28.640 --> 36:30.120
[both gasp]

36:30.120 --> 36:34.240
I will protect my children
and blast that thing into space.

36:35.880 --> 36:38.240
[alarm blaring]

36:39.000 --> 36:40.600
- It's an airlock.
- [gasps]

36:44.960 --> 36:46.080
[screeches]

36:48.360 --> 36:49.360
[beeps]

36:53.320 --> 36:55.840
- It is one of the children, Jocelyn!
- [gasps]

36:55.840 --> 36:58.680
I-- [stammers] She's got the sonic.

36:58.680 --> 37:00.240
Jocelyn! Jocelyn! [pants]

37:00.240 --> 37:01.840
- [whimpering]
- [growls]

37:02.360 --> 37:05.240
[computer] <i>Oxygen field at 10%.</i>

37:05.240 --> 37:07.160
Okay, okay, okay, okay.
We haven't got time.

37:07.160 --> 37:08.680
- [stammers]
- Stop Jocelyn, yeah?

37:08.680 --> 37:10.800
- Wait--
- Left, second right,

37:10.800 --> 37:12.880
- next left, you'll get to the lift.
- What about you?

37:12.880 --> 37:15.320
- Left! Second right! Next left!
- Right! Okay.

37:15.320 --> 37:17.240
[panting]

37:17.240 --> 37:18.480
[roars]

37:18.480 --> 37:21.360

37:21.360 --> 37:22.960
You're hurting him!

37:22.960 --> 37:24.560
Stop it, Nan-E! Stop it!

37:24.560 --> 37:26.480
[screeching]

37:28.680 --> 37:29.520

37:32.200 --> 37:34.360

37:34.360 --> 37:36.520
I am the last of the Time Lords.

37:37.280 --> 37:38.280
[panting]

37:39.840 --> 37:41.800
- How do you keep going?
- For days like this.

37:41.800 --> 37:43.600
[panting]

37:43.600 --> 37:47.800
I'm the only one of me
in the whole wide universe.

37:49.360 --> 37:51.920
<i>No one else like me exists,</i>

37:52.600 --> 37:56.200
and that is true of everyone.

37:57.320 --> 37:59.040
The only one of its kind.

[Ruby grunts]

39:02.000 --> 39:03.920

- [Ruby] That's what you do, Jocelyn.

39:03.920 --> 39:05.640
You save them all.

- It's okay. Come here.

39:21.560 --> 39:23.880

- [crying continues]

39:25.920 --> 39:28.200
[sobs]

39:34.040 --> 39:37.040
Attention. Calling Captain Poppy.

39:37.040 --> 39:39.920
Calling all crew. Especially you, Eric.

39:39.920 --> 39:42.400
Plus Ruby. Jocelyn Sancerre.

39:42.400 --> 39:43.680
Nan-E was very naughty.

39:43.680 --> 39:46.600
I know. And I'm so sorry.

39:46.600 --> 39:47.720
All of you.

39:47.720 --> 39:49.960
[cooing]

39:50.560 --> 39:53.320
I was just on my own

39:54.920 --> 39:56.800
for such a very long time.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.480
- We still love you, Nan-E.
- [babies] Yeah. We do.

39:59.480 --> 40:02.440
- Yay!
- But-- But, but, but, but, but...

40:03.200 --> 40:06.480
your favourite monster is fine.

40:07.240 --> 40:09.440
- [Ruby] Look.
- [Doctor] Look, look.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.040
[babies] Yay.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.400
[howls]

40:14.400 --> 40:18.120
[all howling]

40:19.400 --> 40:22.760
But listen, listen, babies, space babies,

40:22.760 --> 40:25.640
your world is over here.

40:25.640 --> 40:27.320
[babies exclaim]

40:27.320 --> 40:29.440
The world of Mondo Caroon.

40:29.440 --> 40:33.080
[gasps] But-- But you can't get there.

40:33.080 --> 40:34.440
Got no engines.

40:34.440 --> 40:35.680
[babies whimper]

40:35.680 --> 40:41.680
Except, turns out that build-up
of pressure in Hull-3-B is from you.

40:41.680 --> 40:44.600
- [giggles]
- Huh? 'Cause the system went wrong,

40:44.600 --> 40:47.040
and that's where it
stacked up all your nappies.

40:47.640 --> 40:51.440
No wonder it was stinking down there.
For six years, a great pile of shi--

40:51.440 --> 40:53.800
- Nanny filter.
- Shizzle!

40:54.960 --> 40:57.880
A zillion metric tons of methane, babies.

40:57.880 --> 41:00.080
- Space babies.
- [giggles]

41:00.080 --> 41:03.520
But I am gonna let it rip! [laughs]

41:03.520 --> 41:06.520
- [grunts, chuckles]
- [babies exclaim]

41:11.360 --> 41:14.240
Oh, set sail for your new home.

41:14.240 --> 41:16.840
- Babyworld.
- [laughing]

41:16.840 --> 41:18.760
[chuckles] Come here.

41:18.760 --> 41:20.040
Are you happy now, Eric?

41:20.680 --> 41:23.280
Very, very happy. I love you, Ruby.

41:31.160 --> 41:33.400
- [laughs] Wow.
- [Ruby] Whoo!

41:33.400 --> 41:35.800
- So it was a normal day for you then?
- No!

41:35.800 --> 41:39.320
No, that was extra special nuts.

41:39.320 --> 41:42.360
- [laughs]
- [laughs] And you, Ruby Sunday...

41:44.800 --> 41:45.800
get this.

41:46.880 --> 41:48.440
Your very own TARDIS key.

41:49.280 --> 41:50.680
What for? [chuckles]

41:52.480 --> 41:56.480
I have the whole universe
at my fingertips.

41:56.480 --> 41:57.840
[chuckles]

41:58.520 --> 42:00.000
And I'm all on my own.

42:02.840 --> 42:05.640
So I'd love it if you came with me.

42:07.600 --> 42:11.600
[sighs] To what? Just travel?

42:11.600 --> 42:12.680
No job.

42:13.640 --> 42:14.680
No boss.

42:15.400 --> 42:16.720
Just fun.

42:16.720 --> 42:18.480
We did almost die.

42:18.480 --> 42:20.280
Yes, but we lived so much too.

42:20.280 --> 42:21.360
Yes, we did.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.120
- [chuckles]
- Yes, we did.

42:23.120 --> 42:25.320
Yes-- Yes, we did.

42:25.320 --> 42:26.880
[inhales sharply] Hmm.

42:26.880 --> 42:30.440
Yeah, we did. We did, we did.
[sighs] We did.

42:31.680 --> 42:32.680
Yes.

42:32.680 --> 42:34.360
- Yes? Yes?
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

42:34.360 --> 42:36.000
- Oh, my God. Yes. Yes!
- Yes. Yes!

42:36.000 --> 42:37.640
[both exclaiming]

42:37.640 --> 42:40.240
- Ruby Sunday said yes!
- Come on in. Follow me. [laughs]

42:40.240 --> 42:41.360
[Doctor] Oh, come on.

42:41.360 --> 42:42.960
[chuckles]

42:42.960 --> 42:44.520
- [Ruby chuckles]
- Ah.

42:44.520 --> 42:46.120
[both laugh]

42:46.120 --> 42:49.280
All right, mate.
Let me tell you where we're gonna go.

42:49.280 --> 42:50.360
[chuckles]

42:51.040 --> 42:52.280
Except--

42:52.280 --> 42:55.440
Oh, terms and conditions. [chuckles]

43:00.160 --> 43:04.920
There is one thing
that I can never do, Ruby.

43:05.880 --> 43:09.840
And that's take you to
that church on Ruby Road

43:10.680 --> 43:11.880
that Christmas.

43:14.120 --> 43:15.600
Absolutely never.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.320
But you've got a time machine.

43:20.320 --> 43:22.600
If you change one thing,

43:23.720 --> 43:27.240
a single snowflake, that could change
your birth mother's story.

43:27.240 --> 43:30.360
And then you would never meet me.
None of this would ever happen.

43:30.880 --> 43:37.240
And we would fall into the deepest,
darkest paradox. Ruby, trust me.

43:38.800 --> 43:40.640
I think that snow was a warning.

43:41.640 --> 43:42.800
[sighs]

43:42.800 --> 43:43.880
I can't.

43:45.360 --> 43:46.360
And I won't.

43:49.960 --> 43:53.600
[inhales deeply, smacks lips]
Well, it's a pity. [sighs]

43:54.680 --> 43:55.760
'Cause I disagree.

43:57.280 --> 43:59.160
And if you let me finish,

44:00.400 --> 44:01.760
we are gonna go see my mum

44:02.520 --> 44:03.920
at Christmas.

44:04.720 --> 44:05.720
Right now.

44:06.520 --> 44:07.520
Come on.

44:08.880 --> 44:12.560
And Ruby phoned.
She said, "I love you", and ran off.

44:12.560 --> 44:16.080
No word from her since.
What sort of Christmas is this?

44:16.080 --> 44:18.000
It all started with this man.

44:18.000 --> 44:19.840
He called himself the Doctor.

44:19.840 --> 44:20.840
[scoffs]

44:20.840 --> 44:21.880
[whirring]

44:21.880 --> 44:22.960
Hold on.

44:24.720 --> 44:26.200
- What's that noise?
- [TARDIS warbling]

44:26.200 --> 44:27.960
[clattering, rumbling]

44:34.120 --> 44:36.200
Ooh, what the blinking flip?

44:38.440 --> 44:39.960
Hiya, Mummy. [chuckles]

44:40.720 --> 44:42.160
[Carla] What are you doing?

44:42.160 --> 44:44.560
And what the hell is that?
What's it done to my kitchen?

44:45.320 --> 44:46.800
Hey, come and say hello.

44:46.800 --> 44:48.440
Yes, coming.

44:48.440 --> 44:50.000
Tell your mum not to slap me.

44:50.800 --> 44:51.800
[sighs]

44:51.800 --> 44:53.680
[screwdriver whirrs]

44:59.480 --> 45:02.200
Yes, now, the people from my world,

45:02.200 --> 45:07.280
they use titles like the Bishop,
the Pedant, the <i>Sagi-shi</i>.

45:07.920 --> 45:09.880
My name was...

45:09.880 --> 45:10.960
[door closes]

45:20.520 --> 45:23.560
[theme song playing]

45:23.560 --> 45:27.040
- [Doctor laughs] <i>Abbey Road Studios!</i>
- [Ruby squeals]

45:27.040 --> 45:28.520
[Doctor] <i>Everything's gone dull.</i>

45:28.520 --> 45:30.360
If music is gone,
that means everything is changing.

45:30.360 --> 45:34.760
<i>The Toymaker said--
He said, "My legions are coming."</i>

45:34.760 --> 45:37.320
I can't fight this thing. [pants]

45:37.320 --> 45:39.400
[song continues]
