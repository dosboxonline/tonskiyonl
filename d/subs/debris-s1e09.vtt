00:04.629 --> 00:06.798
MALE NARRATOR:
Previously on Debris...

00:06.840 --> 00:08.550
BRYAN:
They found your father.

00:08.591 --> 00:11.219
MADDOX:
Our main priority is
to recover George.

00:11.261 --> 00:13.346
FINOLA (on speaker):
We can't let the Americans
take possession of him.

00:13.388 --> 00:15.849
-FINOLA: Dad.
-MADDOX: This isn't
a retrieval, Bryan.

00:15.890 --> 00:18.101
-Step aside.
-No.

00:18.143 --> 00:19.853
Please tell Maddox
my father wasn't even here.

00:19.894 --> 00:21.646
Come on!

00:21.688 --> 00:24.858
He and his government took
Orbital away from me.

00:24.899 --> 00:26.651
They are liars, all of them.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.821
I don't know how you could've
done that to us.

00:29.863 --> 00:32.824
I have a chance
to set things right.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.497
(straining)

01:30.674 --> 01:32.258
Kathleen!

01:35.261 --> 01:36.388
Kathleen!

01:39.933 --> 01:41.559
What's wrong?

01:43.645 --> 01:46.856
Who are you?

01:46.898 --> 01:48.692
I don't know who you are.

01:48.733 --> 01:52.529
I'm Mac.
What are you talking about?

01:52.570 --> 01:54.406
I don't know who you are.

01:55.824 --> 01:58.618
Stop saying that, Shelby.
Stop it!

01:58.660 --> 01:59.953
That's not true!

01:59.994 --> 02:02.163
I am your brother!

02:03.498 --> 02:05.875
What?

02:05.917 --> 02:08.253
Where's Kathleen?

02:08.294 --> 02:09.337
Where's my sister?

02:10.964 --> 02:12.841
Where is she?

02:12.882 --> 02:15.677
We don't have a sister!

02:15.719 --> 02:18.221
What?

02:18.263 --> 02:21.266
Oh, no. No.

02:22.976 --> 02:25.687
Oh, my God.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.522
Oh, my God.

02:35.363 --> 02:38.700
She's gone.
She's gone.

02:39.617 --> 02:40.869
** (theme)

03:16.321 --> 03:17.947
-BRYAN: Are we lost?
-FINOLA: Hmm?

03:17.989 --> 03:19.783
-Are we lost?
-No, no, no.

03:19.824 --> 03:21.993
Um, just keep going
There's going to be a bend,

03:22.035 --> 03:24.996
and you're gonna wanna
take a left.

03:27.499 --> 03:29.292
It's like he is in a coma.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.672
FINOLA:
Yeah. He's been through a lot.

03:33.713 --> 03:35.924
I think he needs it.

03:35.965 --> 03:39.511
What are we gonna do
about Maddox?

03:41.805 --> 03:43.598
He doesn't suspect anything.

03:45.058 --> 03:48.978
I can feel it.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.480
We're going to go to Garcia's,

03:50.522 --> 03:52.065
get George the equipment
that he needs

03:52.107 --> 03:54.484
and let it play out.

03:56.569 --> 03:59.030
We're betraying both our
countries.

04:01.491 --> 04:03.785
I don't even care.

04:03.827 --> 04:06.079
I watched as they

04:06.121 --> 04:10.041
systematically took his life's
work away from him,

04:10.083 --> 04:12.377
where they took Orbital away
from him.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.962
I mean, you know what
that reduced him to?

04:16.089 --> 04:19.050
It was so hard to watch.

04:19.092 --> 04:22.846
There's a part of me that's
always held them responsible.

04:25.890 --> 04:28.685
That holds Maddox responsible
for his suicide.

04:33.606 --> 04:35.442
What about Ferris?

04:35.483 --> 04:37.444
You said that you told her
you were calling the shots?

04:37.485 --> 04:39.029
Will she accept that?

04:39.070 --> 04:41.990
Yeah, I mean,
all Ferris cares about

04:42.032 --> 04:46.119
is not letting the Americans
have more information
than we have.

04:46.161 --> 04:49.330
Will she turn over
the Laghari files?

04:51.499 --> 04:53.084
Yeah.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.753
-(device chimes)
-Yeah, she will.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.090
A new event just came in.

04:59.132 --> 05:02.719
Near Oceanside,
Washington State.

05:02.761 --> 05:05.805
Atmospheric inconsistencies.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.599
(tires screeching)

05:07.640 --> 05:08.975
(Finola sighs)

05:09.017 --> 05:10.393
GEORGE:
What happened?

05:10.435 --> 05:12.437
It's okay. It's okay, Dad.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.855
We almost hit a deer.

05:15.398 --> 05:16.983
Just came out of nowhere.

05:18.026 --> 05:19.986
(George sighs)

05:20.028 --> 05:22.530
Good driving.

05:22.572 --> 05:25.742
Although, you do tend to drive
a little fast for my taste.

05:25.784 --> 05:30.372
Haste is a signifier
of disorganization.

05:32.624 --> 05:34.834
I will take note of that.
Thank you, George.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.878
You're welcome.

05:52.060 --> 05:53.478
Stay here.

05:55.021 --> 05:56.064
(door closes)

05:59.984 --> 06:05.615
Did Bryan tell you about
this man, Garcia?

06:05.657 --> 06:10.620
Yeah. He said he was
some scientist at Orbital,

06:10.662 --> 06:12.789
and he was injured
in a Debris event.

06:12.831 --> 06:15.166
Bryan said you know him.

06:18.003 --> 06:21.631
Yes, I do.

06:28.680 --> 06:30.890
(knocking)

06:38.106 --> 06:39.107
Bryan.

06:40.942 --> 06:42.152
Garcia.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.954
Hey, man.

06:52.996 --> 06:54.706
Hey.

06:58.126 --> 07:02.756
You look healthy.
You're still taking
the injections?

07:02.797 --> 07:05.467
Yeah, when they send them to me.

07:09.679 --> 07:13.892
Finola, this is Garcia.

07:15.226 --> 07:16.269
Hi.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.146
Nice to meet you.

07:22.150 --> 07:24.110
Hello, Gary.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.820
George.

07:31.618 --> 07:34.162
Draw your list. If there's
anything I don't have,

07:34.204 --> 07:37.207
I know where to find it
without raising any alarms.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.129
(device chimes)

07:43.171 --> 07:44.172
(Finola sighs)

07:46.174 --> 07:48.802
FINOLA: We have to go
to Washington State
on a case now.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.304
It's not too far.
I wish we didn't have to,

07:51.346 --> 07:55.141
but we have to keep things
just moving as normal.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.936
Maddox can not suspect that
anything's wrong.

08:00.063 --> 08:01.564
Are you gonna be okay?

08:05.110 --> 08:07.779
I'll be perfectly fine.

08:07.821 --> 08:08.988
Let's get to work.

08:14.369 --> 08:15.954
FINOLA:
The latest SAT scans
have come in,

08:15.995 --> 08:17.247
I don't see any change.

08:17.288 --> 08:19.082
BRYAN:
We should be getting close.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.333
FINOLA:
It's just up ahead
on the left.

08:20.375 --> 08:22.669
-(device chimes)
-FINOLA: This is it.

08:28.883 --> 08:30.844
-I love the sea.
-(device chimes)

08:30.885 --> 08:32.804
You getting anything?

08:32.846 --> 08:35.890
-(device scanning)
-Yeah.

08:35.932 --> 08:38.226
It's faint,
but it's definitely here.

08:41.146 --> 08:43.773
Let's go check if they saw
anything come down.

08:54.617 --> 08:57.078
-(doorbell chimes)
-(latch clicks)

08:58.955 --> 09:02.667
Hey, there. Agent Beneventi,
this is Agent Jones.

09:02.709 --> 09:04.169
Your parents home?

09:04.210 --> 09:05.879
No. No, they're not.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.256
Do you know
when they'll be back?

09:08.298 --> 09:09.674
SHELBY:
Come on in.

09:12.427 --> 09:14.304
-It's okay. They're traveling.
-Who are?

09:14.346 --> 09:18.016
My parents,
they're traveling.

09:18.058 --> 09:20.977
Won't be back until
the end of the month.

09:21.019 --> 09:22.645
Take a seat.

09:22.687 --> 09:25.648
-What's your name?
-Shelby.

09:25.690 --> 09:28.860
We're, um...

09:28.902 --> 09:32.989
We're here in Oceanside
to investigate pieces of
a crashed military aircraft.

09:33.031 --> 09:37.369
You're part of
a recovery effort?

09:37.410 --> 09:41.289
That's right. Have you seen
anything or heard anything?

09:41.331 --> 09:42.832
Is that your little brother?

09:44.250 --> 09:47.712
Apparently. His name's Steven.

09:49.422 --> 09:51.925
Have you seen anything fall
from the sky

09:51.966 --> 09:54.260
or heard anything like that,
past few days?

09:54.302 --> 09:57.639
Yeah. Yeah, I have.

09:59.432 --> 10:03.687
Found what you're looking for,
actually.

10:03.728 --> 10:06.147
It's alloy wreckage.

10:06.189 --> 10:09.401
I found it with my sister
Kathleen when we were diving.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.779
I know that's part
of a crashed alien ship.

10:15.448 --> 10:17.242
How do you know that?

10:17.283 --> 10:20.120
We found it, examined it,

10:20.161 --> 10:21.955
went in it.

10:21.996 --> 10:24.332
It transported us
two days into the past.

10:25.709 --> 10:28.128
At first, it was amazing.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.797
We did it again.
We kept doing it,

10:30.839 --> 10:33.383
till one time I came back
and my sister was gone.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.051
It's like she was never born.

10:35.093 --> 10:36.803
And now it's worse.

10:36.845 --> 10:38.179
Now every time I go out there,

10:38.221 --> 10:39.806
I don't know what version
of reality

10:39.848 --> 10:43.184
is waiting for me
when I get back here.

10:43.226 --> 10:44.978
Sometimes I have other siblings,

10:45.020 --> 10:46.187
other times I'm alone,

10:46.229 --> 10:49.024
but Kathleen never comes back.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.112
How far out to sea is it?

10:57.198 --> 10:58.783
(sighs)

10:58.825 --> 11:01.411
I'm going to keep using it,

11:01.453 --> 11:03.830
till it resets properly
and I get my sister back.

11:03.872 --> 11:06.750
I don't know
what you think you know,

11:06.791 --> 11:10.837
but that's just
not gonna happen.

11:10.879 --> 11:14.215
Yeah. Yeah, you've said that
before.

11:17.844 --> 11:22.098
Not the last time you were here,
but the time before that.

11:22.140 --> 11:24.768
You see, every time
you come here,

11:24.809 --> 11:26.978
you get my story
and call your father George.

11:27.020 --> 11:30.482
He's in Oregon. He's been
helping me figure this out.

11:30.523 --> 11:34.027
Each time,
I learn a little bit more.

11:34.069 --> 11:36.154
My, uh...

11:36.196 --> 11:37.781
my father's been helping you?

11:37.822 --> 11:40.116
Yeah. At first,
he thought it was time travel,

11:40.158 --> 11:43.036
but that didn't make sense
because we'd only jump back
a couple days,

11:43.078 --> 11:44.871
and my sister was born
20 years ago,

11:44.913 --> 11:47.082
yet somehow she was erased.

11:47.123 --> 11:50.335
George already determined
it's not just time travel.

11:50.377 --> 11:53.004
He said the Debris
is allowing me

11:53.046 --> 11:56.299
to pluck out cards
from the deck of reality.

11:56.341 --> 11:59.052
He already warned us,
if I don't get back
to my reality,

11:59.094 --> 12:03.098
that the fabric of the universe
is going to degrade at
an increasing rate.

12:03.139 --> 12:06.267
I need you to call him again,
if you want to save
the world.

12:06.309 --> 12:08.144
Have any questions?

12:12.565 --> 12:15.402
GEORGE:
That's remarkable.

12:15.443 --> 12:20.198
It's like you're drifting
through a kaleidoscope
of timelines.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.409
The last thing you told
me to try was to do the jump

12:22.450 --> 12:24.953
at the exact time as I did
the last one with my sister.

12:24.994 --> 12:26.496
GEORGE (on speaker):
Yes. That sounds like
something I would say.

12:26.538 --> 12:28.832
What happened?

12:28.873 --> 12:31.543
Well, I tried it
at exactly 4:03 P.M.,
but it didn't work,

12:31.584 --> 12:33.837
I still keep coming up
in a reality without her.

12:33.878 --> 12:37.132
Perhaps, it's failing
because the reset needs

12:37.173 --> 12:39.467
to happen at the precise time

12:39.509 --> 12:42.554
that you initially
triggered the Debris,

12:42.595 --> 12:44.931
not just 4:03 P.M.,

12:44.973 --> 12:50.937
but 4:03 and 22.983 seconds.

12:50.979 --> 12:53.565
Yeah, but of course,

12:53.606 --> 12:55.442
if that's the case,
you could be doing this,

12:55.483 --> 12:58.820
for a lifetime and--
and never succeed.

13:00.280 --> 13:02.115
I can't accept that.

13:02.157 --> 13:05.952
You said so yourself,
I have to fix this.

13:05.994 --> 13:07.245
There has to be something
I can do.

13:09.622 --> 13:11.291
We have to keep trying.

13:11.332 --> 13:16.087
May I ask,
did you see any colors

13:16.129 --> 13:21.384
-when you triggered the Debris?
-I don't know.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.595
GEORGE: It's important
that you try to remember.

13:23.636 --> 13:27.974
It may help us deduce
what's happening.

13:28.016 --> 13:34.230
Finola? There some concepts
that I would like to run by you.

13:34.272 --> 13:36.983
Can we speak privately?

13:37.025 --> 13:38.026
Yeah.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.447
Yeah, I'm here.

13:42.489 --> 13:45.200
Finola, as much
as I want this young man

13:45.241 --> 13:47.160
to get back to his sister,

13:47.202 --> 13:51.039
you cannot let him jump again.

13:51.081 --> 13:54.167
You must convince him
to accept his fate

13:54.209 --> 13:56.127
and realize
that she won't be back.

13:57.712 --> 13:59.547
Why?

13:59.589 --> 14:04.969
These repeated jumps
are causing a cumulative strain

14:05.011 --> 14:06.680
on the fabric of space-time.

14:06.721 --> 14:09.349
It could cause
irreversible damage.

14:09.391 --> 14:11.976
I'm surprised nothing
has happened already.

14:12.018 --> 14:17.190
I would rather he not use
the Debris until I can see it.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.442
FINOLA:
Damage the universe?

14:19.484 --> 14:21.528
But Shelby said the exact
opposite.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.363
He told us that
damage would be done

14:23.405 --> 14:25.031
if he doesn't get back
to his reality.

14:25.073 --> 14:27.659
I have no reason to think
why that would be

14:27.701 --> 14:30.328
or why I would say that.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.248
Do not let him jump
from this reality.

14:33.289 --> 14:34.332
Okay.

14:42.340 --> 14:46.428
He told us that my father said
that the universe would
continue to decay

14:46.469 --> 14:47.679
if he doesn't get back.

14:47.721 --> 14:50.515
It's not true, he's lying.

14:50.557 --> 14:53.727
It's the jumps
that are causing it.

14:53.768 --> 14:56.187
BRYAN:
Why would we do that?

14:56.229 --> 14:59.149
So we would help him
get back to his sister.

15:25.675 --> 15:28.178
Hey, Steven.
Where's Shelby?

15:35.643 --> 15:37.270
(device chimes)

15:37.312 --> 15:39.064
FINOLA:
A new event just came in

15:39.105 --> 15:41.733
near Oceanside,
Washington State,

15:41.775 --> 15:44.027
atmospheric inconsistencies.

15:44.069 --> 15:45.779
We're gonna have
to get out there.

15:45.820 --> 15:50.325
Oh, look. Look at the deer.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.936
What do you think, George?

16:17.977 --> 16:19.771
Yes.

16:19.813 --> 16:22.148
Yes, this'll do nicely.

16:32.701 --> 16:33.868
(device chimes)

16:37.205 --> 16:40.417
Hey, Dad? We have to respond
to the Debris event

16:40.458 --> 16:42.377
in Washington State now.

16:42.419 --> 16:46.297
I wish we didn't, but we have
to keep things moving as usual.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.299
Are you going to be okay?

16:48.341 --> 16:52.220
Yes. I'll-- I'll be fine.

16:53.888 --> 16:56.599
I'd like to get to work
right away.

16:56.641 --> 17:00.603
GEORGE: Garcia, where might
I find the circuit boards?

17:00.645 --> 17:02.313
BRYAN:
He's in good hands.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.527
FINOLA: The signature's just up
here, just to the right.

17:13.700 --> 17:16.494
I love the sea.

17:16.536 --> 17:18.496
You getting anything?

17:18.538 --> 17:19.539
-(device sounding)
-Yeah.

17:21.332 --> 17:23.668
Faint. But there's definitely
something out there.

17:33.345 --> 17:37.724
-FINOLA: Hello? Federal agents.
-SHELBY: In here.

17:37.766 --> 17:41.811
Agent Beneventi.
This is Agent Jones.

17:41.853 --> 17:43.855
We've got a few questions
for you.

17:43.897 --> 17:46.858
-Are your parents home?
-No.

17:46.900 --> 17:48.026
They're in Europe up
until the end of the month.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.736
MAC:
I forgot my crayons.

17:53.907 --> 17:55.283
Hey, there.

17:55.325 --> 17:58.370
Say hey to Bryan, Mac.

17:58.411 --> 17:59.412
Hey, Bryan.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.835
How do you know my name?

18:13.593 --> 18:15.845
GEORGE: I wish I could
have done more for you.

18:18.473 --> 18:20.266
Continued treatments.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.771
Tried harder.

18:24.813 --> 18:27.899
I did everything that I could,
but Maddox--

18:27.941 --> 18:28.942
I understand.

18:32.779 --> 18:35.907
-You received my letter?
-Yes.

18:35.949 --> 18:38.743
I couldn't respond.

18:38.785 --> 18:40.036
My family wouldn't allow it.

18:40.078 --> 18:44.290
Well, I don't blame them.

18:48.378 --> 18:52.632
I wondered if you regret
creating Orbital.

18:54.718 --> 18:55.802
No.

18:57.429 --> 18:59.472
Regret wouldn't be the word
I would use.

19:02.934 --> 19:05.770
When Bryan called and told me
what happened to you,

19:05.812 --> 19:09.524
I couldn't help
but see the irony.

19:09.566 --> 19:13.820
In a way, you were eaten
by your own monster.

19:13.862 --> 19:17.824
When the Americans became
involved in this,

19:17.866 --> 19:20.910
the money was necessary,

19:20.952 --> 19:24.789
but the machine of the
coalition,

19:24.831 --> 19:27.417
it got too strong.

19:27.459 --> 19:31.671
The powers that be started
to do things their own way.

19:31.713 --> 19:35.383
And their way was to send people
in before we knew what we were
dealing with.

19:38.011 --> 19:43.725
I... I accepted
what happened to me.

19:43.767 --> 19:46.019
I can say that much,
at least.

19:48.146 --> 19:51.983
And I think you should accept
your fate.

19:54.069 --> 19:59.157
There's always some danger
in new knowledge,

19:59.199 --> 20:00.992
new technology,

20:01.034 --> 20:06.456
but there's also great potential
benefit for humanity,

20:06.498 --> 20:07.999
for understanding,

20:08.041 --> 20:10.126
for quality of life.

20:10.168 --> 20:15.757
There are no rewards
without some element of risk.

20:15.799 --> 20:18.468
I believe that's intrinsic
to our jobs.

20:21.930 --> 20:25.392
And I believe
that you knew the risk.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.484
(device buzzing)

20:37.987 --> 20:39.864
Hello?

20:39.906 --> 20:42.909
GEORGE:
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Go back.

20:42.951 --> 20:46.621
SHELBY: You asked if I could
see colors. The answer's yes.

20:46.663 --> 20:49.666
GEORGE; What colors
did you see exactly?

20:49.708 --> 20:53.211
White, yellow,

20:53.253 --> 20:56.631
maybe red
as the flash happened.

20:56.673 --> 20:57.882
GEORGE:
You didn't see any orange?

20:57.924 --> 20:59.634
SHELBY:
I don't think so, no.

20:59.676 --> 21:04.556
You have to try and remember
the exact shades,

21:04.597 --> 21:06.683
the exact length and spectrum.

21:06.725 --> 21:09.602
Okay. I think I have
an idea. Hold on.

21:15.108 --> 21:16.735
FINOLA:
Damage to the universe?

21:16.776 --> 21:18.528
You told him
that damage would be done

21:18.570 --> 21:20.947
if he doesn't get back
to his original reality.

21:20.989 --> 21:22.907
GEORGE: I have no idea
why that would have be.

21:22.949 --> 21:26.453
And I can't imagine why
I would say such a thing.

21:30.832 --> 21:32.459
(gasps)

21:40.258 --> 21:44.095
GEORGE: You mustn't allow
him jump to another reality.

21:44.137 --> 21:46.473
He lied to us.

21:54.731 --> 21:55.982
Where's your brother, Mac?

21:56.024 --> 21:58.193
Where is he? Bryan!

22:02.781 --> 22:04.491
He said I wasn't his real--

22:16.378 --> 22:18.713
You sure you don't want
to have a bite of this?

22:22.175 --> 22:25.387
I have the plastic spoon,
if you don't want to have
my germs.

22:25.428 --> 22:27.639
It's not the spoon, Niels.

22:27.681 --> 22:31.226
It's the sour fish...
and yogurt.

22:31.267 --> 22:33.103
NIELS:
Omega-3 fatty acids.

22:33.144 --> 22:36.731
100% of the nutrients
I need in a single serving.

22:36.773 --> 22:39.150
I don't know why you don't just
take vitamins like everyone
else.

22:41.778 --> 22:42.946
It's right here.

22:50.412 --> 22:52.831
NIELS:
I love the sea.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.833
Niels, shoot me that Laghari?

22:58.670 --> 23:00.255
-(device sounds)
-You get anything?

23:00.296 --> 23:03.258
Yeah. Faint.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.759
But it's here.

23:04.801 --> 23:08.430
What do you think?
Northeast wind?

23:08.471 --> 23:10.432
Signatures could be coming
from there.

23:10.473 --> 23:12.892
What are you,
a grizzly tracker now, Niels?

23:12.934 --> 23:15.228
How did you know the wind's
coming from the northeast?

23:15.270 --> 23:17.355
Because they are.

23:17.397 --> 23:19.190
I'm telling you.

23:19.232 --> 23:21.818
You just put your tongue
into the air,

23:21.860 --> 23:22.819
and...

23:25.780 --> 23:26.990
Let's go.

23:39.419 --> 23:42.464
(bell chimes)

23:42.505 --> 23:44.966
-Hey there. I'm Agent Beneventi.
-(scoffs)

23:45.008 --> 23:47.344
And this is my partner,
Agent Vinke.

23:47.385 --> 23:48.970
Are your parents home?

23:49.012 --> 23:50.847
This is interesting.

23:50.889 --> 23:52.766
(chuckles)

23:52.807 --> 23:56.144
Come on in.
I took a GoPro to try and film

23:56.186 --> 23:59.481
what he wanted me to find
out about the colors,
but it didn't work.

23:59.522 --> 24:02.275
Now instead of Finola,
you show up with--

24:02.317 --> 24:04.402
I'm sorry,
what's your name again?

24:04.444 --> 24:07.447
-Oh, Niels.
-Niels...

24:07.489 --> 24:10.116
it's imperative that I speak
to George Jones again.

24:13.036 --> 24:14.746
George Jones is dead.

24:14.788 --> 24:17.165
Wait, what are you
talking about?

24:17.207 --> 24:19.793
Yeah, he took his own life
six months ago

24:19.834 --> 24:21.920
in London.

24:24.547 --> 24:29.177
If you'll excuse me.
I need to use the restroom.

24:29.219 --> 24:31.012
(footsteps depart)

24:33.264 --> 24:36.059
Yeah. There's definitely
something wrong with this guy.

24:36.101 --> 24:38.436
Indeed, this guy's nuts.

24:38.478 --> 24:39.979
Call it in.

24:50.323 --> 24:51.491
NIELS:
What's he doing now, this guy?

24:51.533 --> 24:52.492
Hey! Hey!

24:58.498 --> 24:59.874
** ("Gimme Shelter"
by The Rolling Stones plays)

24:59.916 --> 25:01.543
I love the sea.

25:01.584 --> 25:03.336
Rahim, shoot me the Laghari.

25:06.840 --> 25:08.174
(device sounds)

25:08.216 --> 25:10.093
-You get anything?
-(bell chimes)

25:11.803 --> 25:14.139
-Roberta?
-(bell chimes)

25:16.433 --> 25:17.434
Jafar?

25:18.226 --> 25:19.019
Hey!

25:20.270 --> 25:23.148
Claire, toss me
that Laghari a sec.

25:23.189 --> 25:27.027
It's no good, Maria.
Can I use yours?

25:27.068 --> 25:28.903
(bell chimes)

25:28.945 --> 25:32.449
-Thanks, Alvin.
-(device sounding)

25:32.490 --> 25:33.783
Don't break it this time.

25:36.036 --> 25:38.163
Can I see your Laghari?

25:38.204 --> 25:39.330
Sure.

25:41.416 --> 25:43.501
-(device sounding)
-You get anything?

25:43.543 --> 25:44.336
Yeah. Faint.

25:46.921 --> 25:50.258
But there's definitely
something here.

25:50.300 --> 25:51.968
(bell chimes)

25:54.471 --> 25:56.473
-Hey there. Agent Beneventi.
-Welcome back.

25:58.433 --> 26:03.104
** ("Gimme Shelter" continues)

26:03.146 --> 26:04.272
What's your name?

26:05.398 --> 26:06.900
Shelby.

26:06.941 --> 26:08.109
* It's just a shot away *

26:08.151 --> 26:09.611
* It's just a shot away *

26:09.652 --> 26:12.238
* War, children *

26:12.280 --> 26:14.366
Why so many mirrors, Shelby?

26:14.407 --> 26:16.284
I'm looking for my sister.

26:16.326 --> 26:19.079
I can see her
in the mirror sometimes.

26:20.872 --> 26:22.874
Your sister?

26:22.916 --> 26:25.377
I think he's trying to find
her way back to me

26:25.418 --> 26:28.088
from another reality.

26:28.129 --> 26:29.839
FINOLA:
Oh.

26:32.133 --> 26:34.969
(Finola gasps)

26:35.011 --> 26:37.263
What'd you see?

26:37.305 --> 26:38.264
Did you see her?

26:38.306 --> 26:39.891
FINOLA:
I did.

26:42.519 --> 26:45.230
SHELBY:
Kathleen! Kathleen!

26:46.564 --> 26:48.983
(phone rings)

26:49.025 --> 26:50.610
Yo.

26:50.652 --> 26:52.987
Hey, Craig, it's Vince
at the the Federal Grill.

26:53.029 --> 26:55.490
Yeah. Hey, Vince. How you doing?
It's been a long time.

26:55.532 --> 26:57.492
Tell me about it.
I'm just calling

26:57.534 --> 27:01.037
to confirm a reservation
that Julia made for this
afternoon at 1:30.

27:03.123 --> 27:06.084
Yeah. Yeah.
That sounds right.

27:06.126 --> 27:07.168
I'm sitting this one out.

27:07.210 --> 27:08.545
VINCE:
Next time.

27:08.586 --> 27:10.630
-Be good to see you.
-Yeah, you too. Thanks.

27:13.133 --> 27:14.175
(sighs)

27:18.555 --> 27:20.640
Jen.

27:20.682 --> 27:22.559
Can you move everything
after my next meeting?

27:22.600 --> 27:24.519
I need to go out
for a few hours.

27:24.561 --> 27:26.187
-JEN: Okay, sure.
-Thanks.

27:27.605 --> 27:29.941
(line ringing)

27:38.366 --> 27:40.326
Hi, you've reached Julia's
voicemail.

27:40.368 --> 27:41.619
Please leave a message.

28:01.222 --> 28:03.767
Hi. Who are you?

28:03.808 --> 28:06.811
-Who is he?
-Craig, just be calm, please.

28:06.853 --> 28:08.313
-Hi. I'm Justin.
-Shut up.

28:08.355 --> 28:10.815
-Who is he?
-He's a lawyer. I hired him.

28:10.857 --> 28:12.776
He's a lawyer? You hired a--

28:12.817 --> 28:15.403
-I cannot believe this.
-I know this is--

28:15.445 --> 28:17.947
If you say one more word,
I will literally kill you.

28:17.989 --> 28:20.367
You have to tell me
what's going on.

28:20.408 --> 28:22.285
You hired a divorce attorney?

28:22.327 --> 28:24.329
I tried to talk to you.
You don't want to listen.

28:24.371 --> 28:28.541
Well, I'm listening now.
Tell me.

28:28.583 --> 28:31.503
I can't pretend for you,
Craig.

28:31.544 --> 28:34.422
-Okay.
-You try so hard.

28:34.464 --> 28:38.051
You've always tried
so painfully hard.

28:38.093 --> 28:39.844
That's what a husband
supposed to do, right?

28:39.886 --> 28:41.554
You don't want me
to fight for us?

28:41.596 --> 28:45.517
-No.
-You-- You--

28:45.558 --> 28:47.477
You don't want me
to fight for us.

28:47.519 --> 28:49.104
What do you want, Julia?

28:49.145 --> 28:51.356
Nothing.

28:53.316 --> 28:56.069
-The accident.
-(exhales)

28:56.111 --> 28:57.862
Craig.

28:59.447 --> 29:02.534
It was not your fault.

29:02.575 --> 29:05.328
It wasn't your fault.

29:05.370 --> 29:07.914
-No. Stop saying that, okay?
-Sweetheart--

29:07.956 --> 29:10.583
That is exactly the problem,
Craig.

29:10.625 --> 29:13.128
Stop pretending that
it's in the past.

29:13.169 --> 29:15.130
(phone rings)

29:18.049 --> 29:19.968
Julia, listen to me, honey.

29:20.010 --> 29:22.387
A terrible thing happened
to our family.

29:22.429 --> 29:24.431
I'm not in denial
about that.

29:24.472 --> 29:26.558
I know what we've been through,

29:26.599 --> 29:30.937
but I also know what
people can survive,

29:30.979 --> 29:33.898
and I know-- I know what a
strong family can get through.

29:33.940 --> 29:36.276
I've seen it.

29:36.317 --> 29:38.611
And I know that we can get
through this together.

29:38.653 --> 29:43.116
I know we can
because what we have...

29:43.158 --> 29:46.411
that love that we have
for that boy...

29:49.956 --> 29:52.459
This is good.

29:52.500 --> 29:54.627
We're good.

29:54.669 --> 29:59.341
You hear me? You're good.
You're good.

29:59.382 --> 30:02.177
I don't see your world.

30:02.218 --> 30:05.138
I just live
with Dario every day,

30:05.180 --> 30:09.100
and then you come home
and you expect me

30:09.142 --> 30:11.144
to pretend that I'm not unhappy?

30:11.186 --> 30:12.979
That I'm not sad?

30:13.021 --> 30:15.357
That I don't think about
what happened every single day,

30:15.398 --> 30:17.317
every moment of every day?

30:17.359 --> 30:19.110
You want me to just let it go?

30:19.152 --> 30:21.529
We promised each other that we
would get through this together.

30:21.571 --> 30:24.115
Didn't we promise
each other that?

30:24.157 --> 30:28.370
You can't admit it.
You've never been able
to admit it.

30:28.411 --> 30:30.914
'Cause you weren't there,

30:30.955 --> 30:32.499
and you don't know the truth.

30:32.540 --> 30:34.334
But I know.

30:34.376 --> 30:36.336
-I broke us.
-No.

30:36.378 --> 30:39.381
-I broke all of us
with what I did.
-It wasn't--

30:39.422 --> 30:43.385
I was the one who was driving
the car, Craig.

30:43.426 --> 30:47.514
It was me.

30:47.555 --> 30:49.474
And I can't take it back.

30:49.516 --> 30:52.060
I wish I could take it back,
but I can't take it back.

30:55.522 --> 30:59.609
And I can't-- I can't live
with your forgiveness
anymore, okay?

30:59.651 --> 31:01.403
I can't.

31:01.444 --> 31:02.570
I can't. I'm sorry.

31:09.077 --> 31:10.662
I don't wanna accept it.

31:10.704 --> 31:12.539
-Julia, come here.
-I don't accept it.

31:12.580 --> 31:15.041
-Okay.
-Come back.

31:15.083 --> 31:16.459
-Julia.
-(phone ringing)

31:18.003 --> 31:19.963
God.

31:20.005 --> 31:21.256
(phone clatters)

31:24.968 --> 31:28.179
What exactly did I say
about colors last time?

31:28.221 --> 31:31.266
SHELBY: You said I need
to capture the exact sequence
I see in the flash,

31:31.307 --> 31:35.103
so I tried to use the GoPro
but it didn't work.

31:35.145 --> 31:37.439
GEORGE:
You have to focus your mind

31:37.480 --> 31:39.566
and try to memorize
the precise time.

31:39.607 --> 31:40.692
I'm way ahead of you.

31:40.734 --> 31:42.694
I've had to go back
so many times.

31:42.736 --> 31:47.032
I've had to do this over
and over and over again
to get it right,

31:47.073 --> 31:48.658
and the colors,
they go by so fast.

31:48.700 --> 31:51.077
At first is white for a second,

31:51.119 --> 31:53.163
and then it turns to orange,

31:53.204 --> 31:56.041
about twice as long,
and then feeds into yellow

31:56.082 --> 31:58.001
and then back to orange again.

31:58.043 --> 32:01.004
-GEORGE: Orange? Fascinating.
-You said that before.

32:01.046 --> 32:04.132
It's actually what got you
started on this tangent
to begin with.

32:04.174 --> 32:06.676
Dad, but does that mean
anything to you?

32:06.718 --> 32:09.304
There was this Debris piece

32:09.346 --> 32:13.433
that I worked on in Kent, small.

32:13.475 --> 32:15.435
It affected a woman.

32:15.477 --> 32:20.065
Certain desires manifested
themselves in her life somehow.

32:20.106 --> 32:24.235
She also spoke about similar
color patterns.

32:24.277 --> 32:28.031
Are you saying the Debris
is granting desires?

32:28.073 --> 32:30.784
The piece of Debris may have
been a fragment

32:30.825 --> 32:34.746
of the larger Debris
that you're dealing with now.

32:34.788 --> 32:38.083
It may be reading your desires

32:38.124 --> 32:42.045
and shifting you
to a reality that fits.

32:42.087 --> 32:44.297
Shelby, you may be the pilot.

32:44.339 --> 32:46.299
That doesn't make any sense.

32:46.341 --> 32:49.302
All I want-- the only thing--
is to get my sister back.

32:49.344 --> 32:50.595
If that was true,
she'd be here.

32:50.637 --> 32:53.181
No, no. Desire's a funny thing.

32:53.223 --> 32:56.768
Sometimes what we think we want

32:56.810 --> 33:01.147
and what we actually want can
be two different things.

33:01.189 --> 33:04.609
I encourage you
to think on that answer.

33:04.651 --> 33:07.821
It's like the penguin

33:07.862 --> 33:10.281
and the soldier story, Finola.

33:10.323 --> 33:12.826
Exactly like that.

33:12.867 --> 33:15.704
I think that's what
the answer could be here.

33:19.499 --> 33:21.376
Are you still there?

33:28.800 --> 33:30.051
Maybe he's right.

33:33.722 --> 33:36.182
You don't know what
it's like to have a twin.

33:36.224 --> 33:38.685
She's smart, kind,

33:38.727 --> 33:41.730
so many things I'm not.

33:41.771 --> 33:43.690
But sometimes--

33:43.732 --> 33:46.735
Sometimes I wish
she was never born.

33:46.776 --> 33:50.572
I swear in my soul
I don't feel that way now.

33:50.613 --> 33:52.282
I love her so much.

33:55.827 --> 33:57.203
I have to get her back.

33:57.245 --> 33:59.122
I know I can do it.

33:59.164 --> 34:01.541
Damage to the universe?

34:01.583 --> 34:04.336
He told us that you said
you wanted him to go back

34:04.377 --> 34:06.129
in order to stop
the degradation.

34:06.171 --> 34:07.714
A version of me said that.

34:07.756 --> 34:09.758
I don't know why.
The proof is in the mirror.

34:09.799 --> 34:14.387
You see, I believe that they
are reflecting bleed-throughs

34:14.429 --> 34:16.139
from other realities.

34:16.181 --> 34:18.892
This is an indication
of the damage he is doing.

34:18.933 --> 34:22.395
And if these bleed-throughs
are happening,

34:22.437 --> 34:23.897
why are we only seeing them
in the mirrors?

34:23.938 --> 34:25.732
Well, we'll see them
soon enough.

34:25.774 --> 34:28.193
Mirrors are made of glass,

34:28.234 --> 34:31.321
and glass is a very peculiar
substance.

34:31.363 --> 34:34.240
The imperfections
in its molecular structure

34:34.282 --> 34:37.744
cause gaps in the flow
of light waves.

34:37.786 --> 34:42.582
Yeah. And these gaps allow
for the glimpses of other
realities.

34:42.624 --> 34:45.669
-Yes. The mirrors are a promise
of what's to come.
-Yeah.

34:45.710 --> 34:47.879
This would be my guess.

34:47.921 --> 34:49.839
My father never told you
to keep jumping,

34:49.881 --> 34:51.925
not this time
or the time before that.

34:51.966 --> 34:53.635
Every time he tries
to save his sister,

34:53.677 --> 34:56.221
he makes it worse,
and he knows it!

34:56.262 --> 34:57.138
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

35:30.714 --> 35:31.840
It's here.

35:52.402 --> 35:55.613
-(device sounding)
-Picking up steady,
low-grade signatures.

35:55.655 --> 35:58.199
Maybe someone over
at that house knows something.

36:01.828 --> 36:05.582
You don't realize it.

36:05.623 --> 36:08.835
There's a piece of Debris
out there in the ocean.

36:08.877 --> 36:12.005
It's resetting reality.

36:12.047 --> 36:14.424
What do you mean?

36:14.466 --> 36:15.467
Nothing.

36:25.643 --> 36:27.896
Glad to see me?

36:27.937 --> 36:30.482
-Hey.
-I remember now too.

36:30.523 --> 36:31.691
Bryan, what are you doing?

36:31.733 --> 36:33.568
What did you do? Huh?

36:33.610 --> 36:35.779
I told you. You didn't have
to come with me.

36:35.820 --> 36:36.780
I didn't tell you to do that.

36:36.821 --> 36:38.865
WOMAN:
Bryan, hey, look at me.

36:38.907 --> 36:41.493
You got me into this,
you are going to get me out.

36:41.534 --> 36:43.995
-Bryan, look at me!
-You did not do
what George said to do.

36:44.037 --> 36:45.705
-I told you--
-You did not do it.

36:45.747 --> 36:48.958
Yes, I did! I did it, okay?
I love my sister.

36:49.000 --> 36:51.836
I'm telling you the truth.
I want her back more than
anything.

36:51.878 --> 36:55.090
I tried what he said.
Believe me.

36:56.675 --> 36:58.510
WOMAN:
Bryan.

37:11.147 --> 37:15.485
BRYAN: What you're seeing is
a bleed-through from another
reality.

37:15.527 --> 37:18.405
The universe is breaking down.

37:18.446 --> 37:20.990
We have to leave until
the situation team gets here.

37:21.032 --> 37:23.410
You can't do that.
I have this under control.

37:23.451 --> 37:25.578
Bryan, I have known you for five
years.

37:25.620 --> 37:27.622
You do not have this
under control.

37:27.664 --> 37:29.582
You are not my partner. I don't
even know what your name is.

37:29.624 --> 37:31.960
It's me, Grace.
What is wrong with you?

37:33.586 --> 37:36.965
Grace. I know how this looks,

37:37.007 --> 37:39.843
but I am imploring you
to understand

37:39.884 --> 37:42.470
that what is happening right now
you cannot comprehend.

37:42.512 --> 37:46.016
-Bryan.
-This is not my reality.

37:46.057 --> 37:48.893
I need that Debris to get me
back to it.

37:48.935 --> 37:51.479
Do you know who George Jones is?

37:51.521 --> 37:52.856
I do.

37:52.897 --> 37:55.525
Is he alive?

37:55.567 --> 37:58.695
He was killed in an INFLUX raid
a week ago.

37:58.737 --> 38:02.115
You were there.

38:02.157 --> 38:03.408
I'm worried about you.

38:05.493 --> 38:08.955
I'm calling a situation team
right now, Bryan.

38:08.997 --> 38:12.584
(phone ringing)

38:13.918 --> 38:15.003
Agent Jones.

38:16.963 --> 38:19.549
Hello? Agent Jones.
How can I help you?

38:19.591 --> 38:21.509
This is Bryan Beneventi.

38:21.551 --> 38:25.013
I'm an American Orbital Agent
working out of Langley.

38:25.055 --> 38:26.473
Okay.

38:26.514 --> 38:28.141
(computer beeping)

38:28.183 --> 38:30.560
How can I help you, Bryan?

38:30.602 --> 38:34.147
Everything that I'm about
to tell you is going to make
no sense.

38:34.189 --> 38:36.900
Every word of it is going
to feel wrong.

38:36.941 --> 38:39.986
You're gonna think it's insane
and that I am clearly in
psychological danger,

38:40.028 --> 38:41.738
but that is not the case.

38:41.780 --> 38:44.741
Do you have access
to a terminal right now?

38:44.783 --> 38:47.202
-Do you have access
to our site?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah.

38:47.243 --> 38:50.538
Look up a case file J071068.

38:50.580 --> 38:51.748
FINOLA:
Um...

38:53.792 --> 38:58.630
Active atmospheric disturbance
in Oceanside, Washington.

38:58.672 --> 39:03.009
Correct. We've located a piece
that is causing shifts.

39:03.051 --> 39:06.221
-Yeah.
-Cascades of fractures
into space-time.

39:06.262 --> 39:08.765
Now, go back to the beginning
of the conversation

39:08.807 --> 39:11.267
when I told you that you were
going to think this is
completely insane.

39:11.309 --> 39:14.187
I have come in contact
with the Debris,

39:14.229 --> 39:18.566
and I am not the Bryan Beneventi
that belongs here.

39:18.608 --> 39:22.654
I am another version
of Bryan Beneventi

39:22.696 --> 39:26.658
in an alternate reality where
your father is still alive.

39:29.285 --> 39:34.624
I work with him, and he said
something to me before I was
separated from him,

39:34.666 --> 39:37.585
something that I think is key

39:37.627 --> 39:40.296
to stopping what is happening
right now.

39:40.338 --> 39:44.843
He told a story about a soldier
and a penguin.

39:44.884 --> 39:48.013
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

39:48.054 --> 39:53.309
Yeah. It's a story that
was written for my mother.

39:53.351 --> 39:55.228
-(device beeps)
-(door slams)

39:58.189 --> 39:59.232
(computer beeps)

40:04.237 --> 40:07.866
BRYAN: I don't know that this
could be fixed, but I am
desperately trying.

40:11.911 --> 40:17.000
Finola I'm trying to get back
to somebody.

40:17.042 --> 40:18.793
It's very important to me.

40:18.835 --> 40:21.671
Please, how could I know
all this

40:21.713 --> 40:25.300
if what I'm saying isn't true?

40:25.342 --> 40:27.761
He said there was something in
the story that could help me.

40:30.889 --> 40:36.686
It's about a solider who guides
a penguin across the desert

40:36.728 --> 40:39.064
to be with the one he loves.

40:39.105 --> 40:42.192
And over the treacherous
passage,

40:42.233 --> 40:48.031
the penguin asked the soldier
why he risks his life

40:48.073 --> 40:52.243
guiding others to their
heart's desire.

40:52.285 --> 40:55.288
He asked if he wishes he had
something to cross the desert
for,

40:55.330 --> 40:59.918
but the soldier just simply
says, "No."

40:59.959 --> 41:02.045
And once they reach their
destination,

41:02.087 --> 41:05.006
the penguin thanks the soldier,

41:05.048 --> 41:08.385
and shares an observation.

41:08.426 --> 41:12.180
He tells the soldier,
"You fight so bravely

41:12.222 --> 41:16.851
because you have nothing,
and you want nothing

41:16.893 --> 41:19.396
because you are afraid to have
something to lose,

41:19.437 --> 41:22.649
because if you did,

41:22.691 --> 41:26.611
your heart would no longer be
still."

41:28.988 --> 41:31.074
The point of this story--

41:31.116 --> 41:35.078
You can spent a lifetime hiding
from yourself what you truly
want.

41:35.120 --> 41:38.081
(phone vibrates)

41:38.123 --> 41:39.165
MADDOX:
What's the assessment?

41:39.207 --> 41:41.668
We have a problem with Bryan.

41:41.710 --> 41:44.671
I think he's somehow being
affected by the Debris.

41:44.713 --> 41:46.006
What do you mean?

41:46.047 --> 41:48.299
He's saying they have to jump
again.

41:48.341 --> 41:51.720
Does that give you an answer?

41:52.887 --> 41:54.222
It does.

41:54.264 --> 41:55.306
You have to talk to him, Grace.

41:55.348 --> 41:56.683
GRACE: I tried.

41:56.725 --> 41:58.018
Don't let him trigger it again.

41:58.059 --> 41:59.352
You have to stop Bryan.

41:59.394 --> 42:01.021
GRACE:
He won't listen to me.

42:01.062 --> 42:02.647
Whatever the cost.

42:10.947 --> 42:13.825
May I ask?

42:13.867 --> 42:16.953
Who's the person that you're
trying to get back to?
Who is it?

42:18.997 --> 42:20.874
You.

42:36.014 --> 42:38.266
MAN: This is Orbital Situation
Team 62.

42:38.308 --> 42:40.018
We just arrived
at Debris Field 56.

42:40.060 --> 42:41.895
We are tending to Agent Garcia.

42:41.936 --> 42:43.355
(beep)

42:43.396 --> 42:45.190
MAN: There is no trace
of Agent... (inaudible)

42:45.231 --> 42:47.275
(beep)

42:47.317 --> 42:48.818
WOMAN:
I was just speaking to him.

42:48.860 --> 42:49.778
(beep)

42:52.030 --> 42:55.033
MAN:
He's gone. He's-- He's gone.
