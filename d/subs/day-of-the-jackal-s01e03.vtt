WEBVTT

00:01.640 --> 00:05.600
The following programme contains
strong language and violent scenes.

00:22.840 --> 00:24.920
Someone I've been working with

00:24.920 --> 00:27.400
has misunderstood
their obligations to me.

00:31.760 --> 00:33.640
There's another deal brewing.

00:33.640 --> 00:36.640
'Why are you still in Munich?
Have you loose ends to tie up?'

00:39.160 --> 00:41.320
Fuck you.

00:41.320 --> 00:42.880
We'll need a codename for you.

00:42.880 --> 00:44.320
Why not the Jackal?

00:50.560 --> 00:52.120
I can get your daughter
out of prison.

00:52.120 --> 00:55.000
Just get me Norman's phone number
and I'll do the rest.

00:58.240 --> 01:00.680
I need a priority location
on a phone.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.400
Aaargh!

01:04.400 --> 01:06.960
Fuck!

01:06.960 --> 01:10.560
This is Mr Carver.
He cleans up messes for us.

01:10.560 --> 01:12.920
I spoke to Sparrow this morning.
She's on the hook.

01:12.920 --> 01:15.000
Did you tell her
that her daughter's dead?

01:18.520 --> 01:21.040

03:27.720 --> 03:29.800
Did you get anything
from Norman's phone?

03:29.800 --> 03:33.560
No, it's been wiped remotely. But
there'll probably be some residue.

03:33.560 --> 03:35.920
Paddy, this one's urgent.

03:38.600 --> 03:41.960
What did you get from his bag?
Might wanna take a look at this.

03:46.440 --> 03:51.480
Now you're gonna love this, Bianca.
It's er... very clever.

04:04.080 --> 04:08.200
This operation has been a total and
utter shambles from start to finish.

04:08.200 --> 04:11.280
We have Emma Stoke,
completely innocent,

04:11.280 --> 04:15.520
whose death went unreported
for more than 36 hours.

04:15.520 --> 04:17.800
And we have two
top Special Forces operatives

04:17.800 --> 04:19.800
killed in a botched snatch.

04:19.800 --> 04:24.440
All of it based on nothing more than
a hunch you had about Norman Stoke.

04:24.440 --> 04:28.800
You, and this operation,
need to be shut down now!

04:30.200 --> 04:34.120
I can't see a reason
to keep it alive. Thank you, Bianca.

04:34.120 --> 04:38.480
I retrieved this... bag

04:38.480 --> 04:40.520
from the suspect's location.

04:40.520 --> 04:42.720
So you found a bag that looks like
a million other bags,

04:42.720 --> 04:45.680
one of which the assassin
happened to have.

04:45.680 --> 04:48.360
What does that prove?

05:12.400 --> 05:16.480
I took this with me
through Customs this morning.

05:17.720 --> 05:21.360
I had no idea I was bringing
a sniper rifle with me

05:21.360 --> 05:24.880
and neither did Security.

05:24.880 --> 05:30.200
It's a prototype.
That is actually bloody clever.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.040
The sniper took the weapon
he used to kill Fest with him.

05:34.040 --> 05:37.560
And this is how he did it.

05:37.560 --> 05:40.480
All thanks to Norman Stoke.

05:42.960 --> 05:45.520
Isabel?
No...

05:47.120 --> 05:49.760
It's complicated.

05:49.760 --> 05:52.760
We just lost two men on an op
that supposedly no-one knew about.

05:54.040 --> 05:56.440
Let's get to the bottom
of what went wrong in Belarus

05:56.440 --> 05:58.480
as quickly as possible.

05:59.520 --> 06:02.080
In the meantime...

06:02.080 --> 06:05.440
your operation
is very much alive, Bianca.

06:06.360 --> 06:07.840
Thank you.

06:22.360 --> 06:25.360
'This is Alison,
leave a message.'

06:25.360 --> 06:28.880
Hi, Alison, it's Nadine.

06:28.880 --> 06:33.680
I...I can't
tell you how sorry I am.

06:33.680 --> 06:37.200
What you must be going through
right now is just...

06:39.600 --> 06:44.160
Look, I know I'm the last person
you wanna speak to right now.

06:44.160 --> 06:47.840
But I've been doing some digging
and it would mean a lot to me

06:47.840 --> 06:50.880
if you'd allow me to sit down
with you face-to-face,

06:50.880 --> 06:53.320
so I can explain what happened

06:53.320 --> 06:58.120
and... try and make
some sense of all of this.

07:00.080 --> 07:02.080
You deserve that.

07:03.600 --> 07:06.240
Again, I'm... so sorry.

07:07.600 --> 07:11.640
OK, er... call me back
when you get this. Thanks.

07:14.080 --> 07:16.080
That was very good.

07:19.040 --> 07:23.360
Well, I'm off to Hereford,
see if they've got any names for us.

07:23.360 --> 07:26.760
Why hasn't that been done already?

07:34.760 --> 07:36.800
Oh!

08:31.680 --> 08:32.840
Nein.

08:47.400 --> 08:49.560
Ja, ja, ja, ja, ja, ja.

09:12.840 --> 09:14.120
Naturlich.

10:40.680 --> 10:42.120
Mm-hm.

13:49.200 --> 13:50.720
Hey.

13:50.720 --> 13:52.720
'Hey! Sorry I haven't called.'

13:52.720 --> 13:54.560
I knew the deal
was gonna be complicated,

13:54.560 --> 13:56.680
but it's got ridiculous.

13:56.680 --> 13:59.560
'Is everything alright?'

14:02.240 --> 14:03.520
Nuria?

14:05.800 --> 14:08.440
The other day
when I left you at the airport.

14:08.440 --> 14:11.360
'Yeah?'

14:14.080 --> 14:16.520
I was at Plaza Las Flores...

14:18.880 --> 14:20.240
I saw you pass in a taxi.

14:23.000 --> 14:25.480
Wait, what do you mean?

14:25.480 --> 14:27.520
'I saw you in a taxi, Charles.'

14:30.680 --> 14:34.160
OK, well, I don't know who you saw
but it definitely wasn't me.

14:35.400 --> 14:38.240
But I saw you.

14:39.920 --> 14:43.400
Nuria, I have no idea who you saw,
but I was straight on that plane.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.120
I don't know where you went.

14:49.360 --> 14:50.840
Where are you now?

14:50.840 --> 14:55.080
Now, I'm in an incredibly
overpriced hotel in Amsterdam.

14:55.080 --> 14:57.920
OK, let me see.

14:57.920 --> 14:59.720
Go on video.
Oh, no, please.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.560
You know I hate the video thing,
come on.

15:01.560 --> 15:04.840
Do you have a woman with you?
''

15:04.840 --> 15:07.840
Of course I don't have
a woman with me.

15:07.840 --> 15:09.640
'Then let me see you.'

15:10.800 --> 15:11.920
'Nuria.'

15:11.920 --> 15:14.680
Charles, let me see you
or I will come to Amsterdam tonight.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.720
OK, OK. Alright, alright.

15:22.280 --> 15:26.600
Hello, it's your husband.
Look, wait, wait, wait.

15:28.200 --> 15:29.680
No woman.

15:30.600 --> 15:33.480
Let me see the bathroom.
Honestly?

15:34.960 --> 15:37.320
OK, let's do this.

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
So... There's um...

15:44.920 --> 15:49.640
...no make-up, no creams, no jars.

15:49.640 --> 15:51.720
No woman.

15:51.720 --> 15:53.800
'Satisfied?'

15:55.280 --> 15:56.920
She might be a very ugly woman.

15:56.920 --> 16:00.720
Yeah, I only have affairs
with incredibly ugly women.

16:00.720 --> 16:02.320
Now can I see my son, please?

16:07.480 --> 16:08.600
'Ma?'

16:08.600 --> 16:11.680
Ma? Que vea Carlitos.

16:11.680 --> 16:13.680
Mira, mira, mira!
Hola.

16:13.680 --> 16:15.040
Oh!

16:15.040 --> 16:17.760
Oh! Que?

16:17.760 --> 16:19.200
Hi.

16:19.200 --> 16:22.400
Que tal?

16:22.400 --> 16:25.040
Look at him, I think,
I think his face has changed.

16:25.040 --> 16:26.480
Is that possible?

16:26.480 --> 16:28.080
Hola!
A-bo!

16:28.080 --> 16:30.880
- A-bo!
- I miss him.
Adios a papa.

16:30.880 --> 16:34.160
Bye-bye.
I love you. Bye-bye.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.560
I miss him.

16:41.920 --> 16:43.680
'He misses you.'

16:47.640 --> 16:49.280
I'm coming to Amsterdam.

16:52.080 --> 16:53.960
I would love that,

16:53.960 --> 16:56.880
but I think they've probably
got me leaving tomorrow, so...

16:56.880 --> 17:00.240
What's wrong, Charles?
You don't want me to come?

17:00.240 --> 17:03.560
No, I would love you to come,
but I...at the moment, honestly,

17:03.560 --> 17:07.560
Nuria, it's so frenzied here that I
literally don't have a minute.

17:07.560 --> 17:09.440
This life we're living,
it's not normal.

17:09.440 --> 17:12.800
Yeah, I know it's not.

17:12.800 --> 17:16.320
'You're always away.
For business you say,

17:16.320 --> 17:19.080
but you never tell me anything
about your business.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.200
I never met any of your colleagues.'

17:21.200 --> 17:23.800
I don't know what you do
when you're away.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.320
'I work, Nuria.

17:26.320 --> 17:30.000
I work, that's all I do.
I just work.'

17:30.960 --> 17:32.520
When are you coming back?

17:32.520 --> 17:34.920
Soon, a couple of days, I-

17:34.920 --> 17:37.120
'When?'
I... Honestly, I don't know.

17:37.120 --> 17:38.440
I'm not sure.

17:40.400 --> 17:42.720
You never know.

17:44.040 --> 17:46.760
It's not good enough, Charles.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.320
Are you coming?

20:28.480 --> 20:30.840
Love, are you coming?

20:33.120 --> 20:35.520
They get you over here
to identify her...

20:36.680 --> 20:39.840
...and then they don't
even fucking call you.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.080
Bit of fresh air will do you good.

20:49.320 --> 20:50.720
You go.

21:34.080 --> 21:36.880
Who's this?
'Who the fuck do you think it is?'

21:39.160 --> 21:40.800
About ye, Norman?

21:49.560 --> 21:53.120
I'm so sorry about Emma.

21:53.120 --> 21:54.960
I can't imagine
what you're going through.

21:54.960 --> 21:58.200
No, you can't.

21:58.200 --> 22:01.360
Larry and me are here
to take Emma home.

22:01.360 --> 22:03.120
Can you not just let us do that?

22:03.120 --> 22:05.960
Do you have no common decency?

22:12.120 --> 22:15.120
You said on the phone
you'd been digging?

22:15.120 --> 22:16.960
I've spoken to everybody.

22:16.960 --> 22:20.840
And I have to tell you
that no one behaved improperly.

22:23.240 --> 22:26.840
Did you know that Emma had
- a pre-existing condition?
- No.

22:28.080 --> 22:30.760
First I heard of it was when
they rang us to tell us the news.

22:30.760 --> 22:34.080
It could just as easily
have happened at home, in bed.

22:34.080 --> 22:36.240
But she wasn't in her bed, was she?

22:36.240 --> 22:38.640
She was in a police cell
and you put her there.

22:38.640 --> 22:40.560
I didn't, Alison.
And I've told you that.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.360
Do you even know what the truth is?

22:44.240 --> 22:46.560
Listen to me carefully, Alison.

22:46.560 --> 22:52.440
Norman killed two British officers
yesterday and now he's disappeared.

22:53.320 --> 22:56.240
What's that got to do with me?
That's nothing to do with me.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.800
Larry's number
was in Norman's phone. So...

22:58.800 --> 23:02.480
We were trying to get
the money to go to London.

23:02.480 --> 23:03.720
Alison.

23:04.880 --> 23:08.640
Assisting an offender
carries a ten-year sentence.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.960
More,
with everything Larry's been up to.

23:14.360 --> 23:17.520
But I've turned a blind eye
because I like you...

23:19.400 --> 23:21.400
...and I want to help.

23:22.840 --> 23:25.640
But now you have to help me.

23:27.160 --> 23:29.880
You need to tell me where Norman is.

23:29.880 --> 23:31.520
Fuck off!

24:03.080 --> 24:05.160
Did you have a nice walk?

24:06.920 --> 24:08.800
Larry, is everything alright?

24:27.240 --> 24:29.920
What have you done?

24:29.920 --> 24:31.960
What?

24:35.320 --> 24:40.200
Why did you keep on at me
to call Norman?

24:42.160 --> 24:44.600
We needed the money to go to London.

24:47.480 --> 24:51.560
Do you know what happened
to Norman... after I called him?

24:52.960 --> 24:55.840
How would I?

24:55.840 --> 24:58.240
What happened?

24:59.200 --> 25:01.240
They came for him.

25:04.320 --> 25:06.320
He popped a couple of 'em.

25:08.920 --> 25:11.160
Is he all right?

25:15.560 --> 25:18.960
Gimme your phone.

25:18.960 --> 25:20.760
Larry, what are you on about?

25:21.880 --> 25:24.080
Give me your phone.

25:44.800 --> 25:46.880
Who's Nadine?

25:48.760 --> 25:51.520
She's the new girl
at the hairdresser's.

25:52.680 --> 25:56.240
So if I call the hairdresser's now
and ask for Nadine...

25:57.280 --> 25:59.560
...is Nadine gonna come on the phone?

26:00.640 --> 26:02.520
She might do. I don't know.

26:04.800 --> 26:07.400
Larry, why are you being like this?

26:07.400 --> 26:09.920
Oh, Alison.

26:11.040 --> 26:13.040
Alison.

26:15.400 --> 26:17.480
What have you done?

26:19.520 --> 26:22.480
What the fuck have you done?

26:24.880 --> 26:27.320
No, don't, Larry.

26:27.320 --> 26:29.360
No!

26:50.960 --> 26:53.960
Cease fire!

26:53.960 --> 26:55.960
Stand up!

26:58.240 --> 27:00.280
Make safe!

27:01.800 --> 27:03.800
Thank you, gentlemen.

27:07.680 --> 27:11.600
These individuals all meet
the parameters I was given.

27:11.600 --> 27:13.800
Do you think any of these men
could have made that shot?

27:13.800 --> 27:17.000
Not unless they've improved
massively from when they were here.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.320
Are you a hundred percent certain
about the distance?

27:19.320 --> 27:21.800
3,815 metres.

27:21.800 --> 27:24.520
That's a fucking long way.
That's what the Germans are saying.

27:24.520 --> 27:26.000
With all due respect to the Germans,

27:26.000 --> 27:28.440
I suggest
someone re-measures the distance,

27:28.440 --> 27:31.040
or else puts me in touch
with whoever modified the weapon,

27:31.040 --> 27:34.360
because whoever it is,
he knows how to make guns.

27:34.360 --> 27:36.760
We could make
very good use of him here.

27:36.760 --> 27:39.200
Yeah, well, thanks for this.

27:40.760 --> 27:43.320
Norman definitely knew
we were coming.

27:43.320 --> 27:47.040
His bags were packed,
and he was ready for a fight.

27:47.040 --> 27:51.200
What's your annual salary?

27:51.200 --> 27:54.760
You know my grade,
you know the pay scales.

27:54.760 --> 27:57.640
And your husband,
he's not a professor, is he?

27:57.640 --> 28:02.760
He's lower down
the university pecking order?

28:02.760 --> 28:04.960
He's a senior lecturer.
Senior lecturer?

28:04.960 --> 28:08.920
So, what does Paul earn? 40, 50?

28:08.920 --> 28:13.120
So it's a comfortable joint wage,
but not mega.

28:14.280 --> 28:18.200
Is there family money?

28:18.200 --> 28:21.240
Your father was... What was he?
Missing.

28:21.240 --> 28:25.240
And your mother?
Has nothing to do with Norman Stoke.

28:25.240 --> 28:26.960
You've been on this side
of the table.

28:26.960 --> 28:29.320
You know why I'm asking.

28:32.520 --> 28:36.960
My mother, if that's what you
wanna call her, was an alcoholic.

28:36.960 --> 28:39.120
She still is.

28:39.120 --> 28:42.200
She lives in sheltered housing now.
Which you pay for.

28:43.920 --> 28:45.920
Must cost quite a penny.

28:46.880 --> 28:51.600
Are you suggesting
I tipped off Norman Stoke

28:51.600 --> 28:54.040
to pay for
my mother's sheltered housing?

28:54.040 --> 28:56.720
Money is almost always the motive.

28:58.560 --> 29:01.640
Let me tell you something, yeah.

29:01.640 --> 29:05.760
I almost got killed
trying to GET Norman.

29:05.760 --> 29:09.320
Two of the men I was with are dead.

29:09.320 --> 29:12.840
You know I didn't tip him off so why
you going through this charade?

29:12.840 --> 29:16.120
You know the world we live in.

29:16.120 --> 29:18.880
You can't trust anyone.

29:18.880 --> 29:21.920
Everyone lies.

29:21.920 --> 29:24.680
About everything.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.320
No.

30:53.880 --> 30:56.560
Damian?
The Special Forces gave me a list

30:56.560 --> 30:58.680
of the best snipers
who fit our parameters,

30:58.680 --> 31:01.120
but they don't think any of them
could have made that shot.

31:01.120 --> 31:04.280
Well, check them out anyway.
Yeah, I will, just got to...

31:04.280 --> 31:07.400
Yep, yeah.
Yeah.

31:29.080 --> 31:32.480
Anything on Norman Stoke?

31:32.480 --> 31:35.280
Er... I spoke to Sparrow in person.

31:35.280 --> 31:38.240
Did you get anything?

31:38.240 --> 31:43.480
Well, she's devastated
and angry about Emma.

31:43.480 --> 31:46.640
She's not in the mood to talk.

31:48.840 --> 31:51.360
When did you last get some sleep?
I'm fine, honestly.

31:51.360 --> 31:53.360
I need you firing on all cylinders.

31:53.360 --> 31:56.880
Go home, get some rest.

32:11.080 --> 32:14.160
'Can anyone hear us?'

32:14.160 --> 32:16.720
Why are you calling me
on my personal phone?

32:16.720 --> 32:18.440
What's going on?

32:35.640 --> 32:38.640
I've just had the pleasure
of Carver's company.

32:40.120 --> 32:42.160
How was that for you?

32:42.160 --> 32:44.920
Unpleasant,
and I've got nothing to hide.

32:45.840 --> 32:49.800
But if there's a leak, it
has to be investigated and resolved.

32:49.800 --> 32:53.440
Something definitely
went wrong in Belarus.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.760
Norman knew we were coming.

32:59.800 --> 33:04.960
Let's assume for present purposes,
it's not you and it's not me.

33:04.960 --> 33:07.480
OK.

33:07.480 --> 33:10.600
The only other people
who knew about the operation

33:10.600 --> 33:12.240
are Damian and Isabel.

33:12.240 --> 33:16.400
Well, if it's Isabel,
we're all fucked.

33:16.400 --> 33:19.280
Indeed.

33:19.280 --> 33:23.760
Could it be Damian?
Why would Damian do it?

33:24.960 --> 33:28.120
Not an easy fellow to pin down,
is he, Damian?

33:28.120 --> 33:30.160
Has a sort of... slippery quality.

33:31.920 --> 33:34.000
Why are we here?

33:35.920 --> 33:37.720
Just to be on the safe side,

33:37.720 --> 33:40.920
what I'm going to tell you
doesn't go any further.

33:40.920 --> 33:43.280
Agreed?
Agreed.

33:45.600 --> 33:50.160
An American friend
has been in contact.

33:50.160 --> 33:53.200
Unofficial, back channel.

33:53.200 --> 33:55.240
I've known him for 20 years.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.600
Ex-station chief
in Ankara and Tokyo.

33:57.600 --> 34:01.480
Level-headed, very judicious.

34:01.480 --> 34:03.640
The Yanks are worried
that the assassination of Fest

34:03.640 --> 34:06.880
will spark copycat murders
of politicians.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.600
They're very keen
to get to the bottom of it

34:08.600 --> 34:11.120
and had been liaising
closely with us.

34:11.120 --> 34:13.320
But now his department
has been told

34:13.320 --> 34:16.640
to not share
any information with 303.

34:18.160 --> 34:21.480
Well, either Carver's right

34:21.480 --> 34:24.560
or the Americans
are trying to sabotage us.

34:25.960 --> 34:28.680
The Americans didn't know
about the Belarus operation

34:28.680 --> 34:30.920
until after it happened.

34:35.560 --> 34:37.320
So... if my friend is right,

34:39.200 --> 34:41.360
the problem is in-house.

34:47.120 --> 34:52.520
From here on, keep the circle tight.

36:33.720 --> 36:37.160
Good morning.
'Have you checked your account?'

36:37.160 --> 36:39.480
Er, I saw that the er,
commencement fee had landed, yeah.

36:39.480 --> 36:41.160
Good.

36:41.160 --> 36:44.400
Rodin is going to be in Tallinn
on the 22nd.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.800
If you leave now you'll have
plenty of time to prepare.

36:46.800 --> 36:51.240
'How reliable's that information?'
A hundred percent.

36:51.240 --> 36:54.080
Understood.
I will start making arrangements.

36:54.080 --> 36:58.280
And we're assuming you finished
whatever business you had in Munich?

36:58.280 --> 37:00.520
Well, that seems like
a decent assumption.

37:00.520 --> 37:03.160
'Good to hear.
We've paid you a lot of money

37:03.160 --> 37:05.120
and we expect to have
your complete attention.'

37:05.120 --> 37:07.240
Absolutely.

38:00.080 --> 38:02.240
How was the Carver experience?

38:02.240 --> 38:04.440
Yeah, he was just doing his job,
I suppose.

38:04.440 --> 38:06.320
Here's the list of snipers.

38:06.320 --> 38:09.640
Appallingly analogue, I know.
But that's the Army for you.

38:09.640 --> 38:12.720
And they've all left the Service.
Thompson's in prison. Manslaughter.

38:12.720 --> 38:15.520
Clegg has MS.
I have addresses for the others.

38:15.520 --> 38:17.840
What do you want me to do?

38:17.840 --> 38:22.120
Find out where they were
- when Fest was killed.
- Copy that.

38:22.120 --> 38:24.080
Thank you.
Anything from Sparrow?

38:24.080 --> 38:26.960
Not yet.
Bianca.

38:26.960 --> 38:29.640
Found something very interesting
on the phone.

38:31.120 --> 38:34.320
Can you get me a coffee, please?

38:34.320 --> 38:37.680
Er, black, no sugar.

38:42.160 --> 38:43.520
Cheers.

38:43.520 --> 38:46.680
Eh, what you got for me?
Well, it was tough.

38:46.680 --> 38:49.880
There's some very serious
encryptions. I'd say state level.

38:49.880 --> 38:52.200
Almost all of the data's
been wiped remotely.

38:52.200 --> 38:54.800
And we were only able to recover
incoming and outgoing numbers.

38:54.800 --> 38:57.040
None of the content but...

38:57.040 --> 38:59.320
in the three weeks leading up
to Manfred Fest's murder,

38:59.320 --> 39:02.280
there was a flurry of calls
and messages from a single number.

39:02.280 --> 39:04.040
Now, interestingly,

39:04.040 --> 39:06.520
they stopped completely
the day Fest was murdered.

39:06.520 --> 39:10.640
Did you get a name for the caller?
Yeah, well, Jackal.

39:10.640 --> 39:12.960
Jackal?
Well, it's codename, obviously.

39:12.960 --> 39:14.640
Alright.

39:14.640 --> 39:18.320
Alright, I'll leave you to it.
Cheers.

39:48.880 --> 39:51.280
Frau Muller.
Herr Fest.

43:04.960 --> 43:07.080
Muller!

43:07.080 --> 43:08.640
Muller!

43:09.640 --> 43:12.840
Muller! Muller!

44:22.800 --> 44:24.640
No...

44:25.640 --> 44:27.640
You know who I am.

44:27.640 --> 44:32.040
Look. I'm... I'm sorry.

44:33.920 --> 44:36.240
I...I hired you to shoot my father
and then you shot me.

44:36.240 --> 44:38.440
So I was just... I was mad.

44:38.440 --> 44:41.520
Ah, ah, I was just mad.

44:42.680 --> 44:44.840
See it from my point of view, please.

44:44.840 --> 44:46.600
Huh?

44:46.600 --> 44:49.560
I'll pay you, I promise. I promise.

44:49.560 --> 44:53.800
I'll pay you...
I'll pay you whatever you want.

45:00.640 --> 45:02.600
But it's not about the money.

45:09.800 --> 45:12.200
Elias.

45:14.560 --> 45:16.600
Elias.
