WEBVTT

00:45.504 --> 00:46.839
It's incredible.

00:46.839 --> 00:49.216
It's not finished. Go away.

00:53.095 --> 00:54.513
How's it feel painting again?

00:56.390 --> 00:57.850
It's pretty wobbly.

00:58.642 --> 01:01.687
Have you given any more thought to
what we talked about the other night?

01:03.355 --> 01:04.397
What?

01:04.397 --> 01:05.691
Quitting the gallery.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.359
Painting full-time.

01:09.444 --> 01:12.865
You-- You better be careful
what you ask for.

01:12.865 --> 01:15.367
You're liable to wind up
with a house full of these.

01:15.367 --> 01:19.872
You are just too good to be curating
other people's work. Seriously.

01:21.248 --> 01:24.293
Well, let's see what happens
with the deal.

01:25.919 --> 01:26.920
The deal...

01:29.381 --> 01:30.424
is done.

01:36.638 --> 01:38.807
These numbers don't even make sense.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.105
Hey, can I get a ride?

01:45.105 --> 01:47.274
- Where do you want to go?
- Skate park.

01:47.274 --> 01:48.942
Yeah, I'll take you.

01:48.942 --> 01:51.320
No, I'll do it. Let me.

01:52.404 --> 01:54.615
I have an errand anyway. I'll take you.

01:55.490 --> 01:56.909
You gonna meet Brooke?

01:58.452 --> 02:01.580
- Yeah.
- Is this the date?

02:02.247 --> 02:03.999
I mean, I could just walk.

02:03.999 --> 02:07.294
Relax. I won't embarrass you.
Come on. Grab your things.

02:09.838 --> 02:11.215
Keep painting.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.146
You a little nervous?

02:28.023 --> 02:29.399
Yeah, little bit.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.028
That's good.

02:33.779 --> 02:37.032
That's not a bad thing, you know?
Nerves keep you sharp.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.409
Yeah.

02:52.798 --> 02:55.050
Have fun, pal. You got this.

03:00.097 --> 03:02.432
- Hey.
- Hey. How's it going?

03:15.946 --> 03:16.947
Well...

03:18.282 --> 03:20.200
you look ready for an adventure.

03:21.869 --> 03:22.953
You like that?

03:23.495 --> 03:24.955
It's a vibe, right?

03:25.998 --> 03:27.249
That for me?

03:28.500 --> 03:29.543
There you go.

03:32.588 --> 03:35.299
And I'll text you my guy, all right.
He's good.

03:35.299 --> 03:37.092
Got me out of a jam a time or two.

03:39.136 --> 03:40.679
Wow.

03:42.514 --> 03:44.474
Sure you wanna seal off the box?

03:46.852 --> 03:47.853
Yeah?

03:51.231 --> 03:52.858
Why'd you really come back?

03:55.694 --> 03:57.154
It was for her, wasn't it?

03:58.280 --> 03:59.323
Yeah.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.701
That's what you fucked up in your world.

04:03.744 --> 04:06.663
Built this instead of
making a life with her.

04:09.458 --> 04:10.501
Am I close?

04:15.088 --> 04:16.298
Safe travels.

04:16.964 --> 04:18.759
Remember everything I've told you.

04:19.801 --> 04:21.887
I really hope you find
what you're looking for.

04:51.583 --> 04:52.626
See you, guys.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.675
- Walk with me? Let's go.
- Yeah.

05:14.314 --> 05:15.315
I...

05:19.444 --> 05:20.946
I bought you something.

05:23.407 --> 05:24.491
You're late.

05:25.075 --> 05:26.076
Yep.

05:29.454 --> 05:32.958
Kind of ornery for a guy who
just spent time with the girl he likes.

05:34.710 --> 05:36.628
Drew was there. Fucked me again.

05:38.297 --> 05:40.757
You know what? You're gonna
have to do something about that.

05:42.092 --> 05:43.093
Like what?

05:44.720 --> 05:47.139
I don't know. It's for you to figure out.

05:47.139 --> 05:49.349
If you don't try something--

05:49.349 --> 05:50.976
Yeah, well, that's easier said than--

05:50.976 --> 05:53.228
Yeah, well, you know,
you're gonna regret it.

05:53.228 --> 05:56.148
And regret will eat you up inside,
that's all.

05:57.900 --> 05:58.901
What?

06:03.197 --> 06:04.823
What's going on? Charlie?

06:05.449 --> 06:07.201
- Is that-- Oh, God. Is that...
- Fuck.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.204
- Allergy?
- Yeah.

06:11.955 --> 06:12.915
What is it?

06:13.832 --> 06:15.918
Bag? I got it. I got it.

06:16.418 --> 06:18.545
What am I looking for?

06:19.213 --> 06:20.214
An EpiPen?

06:20.714 --> 06:23.008
Come on! What does it look like?

06:23.008 --> 06:24.218
Fuck.

06:25.219 --> 06:28.597
This? Hold on. Hold on. Oh, my God.

06:28.597 --> 06:31.225
Now what do I do? Come on. Okay.

06:44.029 --> 06:45.656
Hey. He's fine, right?

06:45.656 --> 06:47.407
- Yeah, he's gonna be fine.
- Okay.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.118
They're just checking him.

06:51.245 --> 06:53.330
- You okay?
- Yeah.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.375
How'd it happen?

06:56.875 --> 06:59.920
It's my fault. I gave him ice cream.

07:00.671 --> 07:01.755
What do you mean?

07:02.464 --> 07:04.258
It had nuts in it.

07:04.258 --> 07:06.343
I-- I didn't read the--

07:06.927 --> 07:08.428
I wasn't thinking.

07:09.054 --> 07:12.891
How much thinking has to happen
to remember he has an allergy?

07:15.644 --> 07:16.645
I know.

08:19.082 --> 08:20.542
What are you doing?

08:23.670 --> 08:26.381
Have to get the gallery space assigned
for the auction.

08:27.049 --> 08:28.759
So busy.

08:35.724 --> 08:41.355
I called dibs on not working the event,
so they dumped all the prep work on me.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.867
Can I help you with something?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.041
Nope.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.299
Hey.

09:14.847 --> 09:16.682
Since when did you start flossing?

09:18.725 --> 09:20.310
I always floss.

09:22.813 --> 09:25.732
You floss the day you have
a dental appointment and it fools no one.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.611
Well, I decided to give a shit
about my gum health.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.154
Is that a problem?

09:32.364 --> 09:35.117
No, just a curiosity.

09:37.953 --> 09:39.121
Okay.

11:25.853 --> 11:27.271
How is it going?

11:28.438 --> 11:29.273
Getting there.

12:24.328 --> 12:26.079
- Fuck.
- What?

12:50.437 --> 12:52.272
- What?
- Door is red.

13:00.614 --> 13:02.115
That's not my wife...

13:03.825 --> 13:05.035
and not my dog.

13:05.577 --> 13:07.996
It's not my door, it's not my house.

13:07.996 --> 13:10.415
It's not my fucking day.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.896
I don't think anybody's home.

13:34.857 --> 13:38.277
But it doesn't matter 'cause
the remembrance tree is not there.

13:41.113 --> 13:42.114
Man.

13:43.991 --> 13:47.035
You know, this is worse than
all those crazy worlds.

13:47.870 --> 13:50.956
A bunch of Chicagos
that are not quite right.

13:52.541 --> 13:56.712
Almost, but none of them are mine.

14:00.757 --> 14:03.552
I don't know that I'm ready
to go back to the box.

14:03.552 --> 14:04.720
Me neither.

14:05.929 --> 14:08.348
We're getting a real place
to sleep tonight.

14:31.413 --> 14:32.706
This is amazing.

14:36.168 --> 14:37.336
Oh, my God.

14:37.336 --> 14:40.422
I'm not sure if it's hunger
or if it's really this good.

14:40.422 --> 14:42.299
- It's really this good.
- It is, right?

14:44.468 --> 14:46.595
Oh, yeah. Hey, well...

14:48.305 --> 14:51.225
You didn't say,
did you find this world's Amanda?

14:52.976 --> 14:54.686
She's not a therapist.

14:55.312 --> 14:56.563
Really?

14:56.563 --> 14:58.273
Ready for this?

14:59.441 --> 15:01.485
She manages a White Castle.

15:01.485 --> 15:02.986
No. No.

15:04.530 --> 15:06.156
At least you're a manager.

15:08.367 --> 15:10.786
Do you ever wonder how, I--

15:11.328 --> 15:15.999
If you strip back the trappings,
like lifestyle

15:15.999 --> 15:18.335
and all the external things,

15:18.335 --> 15:20.838
what are the key components

15:20.838 --> 15:25.217
at your core that make you you?

15:26.009 --> 15:27.177
You mean I'm still her,

15:28.011 --> 15:31.014
White Castle Amanda,
at the most fundamental level?

15:31.598 --> 15:32.599
Yeah.

15:33.100 --> 15:34.101
Exactly.

15:35.811 --> 15:36.979
Well,

15:36.979 --> 15:41.233
personality is just--
it's a pattern of thoughts, feelings,

15:41.233 --> 15:43.151
behaviors unique to each person.

15:44.278 --> 15:47.030
We like to think of it as fixed,
but it's not.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.700
- Yeah, I think people change...
- It's actually not.

15:49.700 --> 15:52.411
...but the essentials stay the same.

15:53.036 --> 15:56.957
Yeah, sure. Our temperament
gets locked around age three,

15:57.583 --> 16:02.087
but that's just the intensity of
our reaction to the environment we're in.

16:02.087 --> 16:05.674
For example, my Jason,
he struggled with his temper.

16:06.675 --> 16:07.968
- Same.
- That's what I thought.

16:07.968 --> 16:12.181
But you are more empathetic and in control
of your impulses than he ever was.

16:12.181 --> 16:15.058
And that's because of your experiences,
your choices.

16:15.058 --> 16:18.770
Our personality changes a lot during
our lifetime and it's--

16:21.064 --> 16:22.858
I love this song.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.070
What?

16:28.780 --> 16:31.116
No. Come on.

16:31.909 --> 16:33.327
No, I'm good. I don't dance.

16:33.327 --> 16:35.412
Of course you don't dance.

16:35.954 --> 16:36.914
He didn't either.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.209
What are you afraid of?

16:41.168 --> 16:42.878
What everyone's afraid of.

16:42.878 --> 16:46.673
If you look stupid,
you can leave this restaurant,

16:46.673 --> 16:51.970
you can leave this city,
or you can literally leave this world.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.263
Let's do that.

16:53.263 --> 16:54.181
Fuck it.

18:29.985 --> 18:31.028
Hey.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.280
Hey.

18:35.199 --> 18:38.869
That was a pretty great night.

18:42.164 --> 18:43.165
Yeah.

18:44.833 --> 18:47.503
Yeah, it was. It's crazy.

18:51.840 --> 18:55.761
I feel like my world is vanishing.

19:00.390 --> 19:06.396
Do you think
that you would ever forget it completely?

19:07.064 --> 19:11.902
I can see getting to a point
where it doesn't feel real anymore.

19:12.653 --> 19:13.820
What do you mean?

19:15.906 --> 19:16.990
Because it's not.

19:19.618 --> 19:23.121
This reality, it's all we have.

19:34.091 --> 19:38.846
If you want me to go to the other bed,
just tell me.

19:44.184 --> 19:45.394
I don't want you to.

19:49.773 --> 19:52.150
I just think that I need you to.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.819
Of course.

20:14.840 --> 20:17.217
Jason, come in.

20:17.885 --> 20:21.138
I have everything I want. Everything.

20:22.681 --> 20:25.934
But I'm here, talking to you,
because, I guess,

20:26.935 --> 20:31.523
it's not everything I imagined.

20:34.151 --> 20:40.908
And trust me, I've worked so hard
to get these things, to get here.

20:43.785 --> 20:47.497
Do you think it's possible
you built it up too much?

20:48.957 --> 20:52.002
Idealized what this time
in your life might be like?

20:53.962 --> 20:55.672
Maybe you always dreamed about

20:55.672 --> 20:59.009
how amazing it would feel
to have all the things:

21:00.594 --> 21:02.846
a wife you love, a son,

21:03.847 --> 21:05.974
the freedom to do whatever you want.

21:06.808 --> 21:08.393
But you forgot something.

21:09.353 --> 21:11.146
Life is still just life.

21:12.481 --> 21:14.399
You said it's not what you expected.

21:15.484 --> 21:16.777
What did you expect?

21:19.238 --> 21:24.409
You're gonna think I'm a dick
if I say perfection.

21:26.912 --> 21:29.081
<i>Now he wants me
to quit my job at the gallery.</i>

21:30.499 --> 21:31.583
Are you going to?

21:33.418 --> 21:37.422
Honestly, I can't really
wrap my head around it all yet.

21:38.006 --> 21:39.258
But it's a lot of money.

21:39.258 --> 21:40.717
- Insane.
- Okay.

21:40.717 --> 21:45.556
Yeah,
but there's all this small stuff too,

21:45.556 --> 21:51.061
like suddenly he flosses every day,
and he dresses better.

21:51.061 --> 21:52.354
Go hire a divorce lawyer.

21:52.354 --> 21:54.106
I know they're tiny things.

21:54.106 --> 21:56.942
- There are just so many of them.
- Keep going.

21:56.942 --> 21:59.945
Like, he leaves his keys
on the kitchen counter

21:59.945 --> 22:01.822
instead of hanging them
on the hook by the front door.

22:01.822 --> 22:04.992
He takes his shoes off
as soon as he walks in the door.

22:04.992 --> 22:07.494
He unloads the dishwasher
as soon as it's done.

22:08.287 --> 22:10.247
He wants to have sex all the time.

22:10.247 --> 22:14.751
Please stop. I'm hearing he's hotter,
cleaner and richer.

22:17.838 --> 22:21.633
That thing with Charlie though,
that's not small.

22:21.633 --> 22:24.428
So, I messed up pretty bad a few days ago.

22:25.762 --> 22:29.516
I gave my son, Charlie, ice cream.

22:30.392 --> 22:34.188
It had nuts in it
and he had to go to the emergency room.

22:34.188 --> 22:35.314
Is he okay?

22:35.314 --> 22:36.565
Yeah.

22:37.482 --> 22:38.483
Yeah.

22:39.234 --> 22:40.569
And I'll make it up to him.

22:41.486 --> 22:44.364
But Daniela, you know,
she's still very upset.

22:46.116 --> 22:47.951
- You apologized?
- Yeah.

22:48.911 --> 22:53.207
Yeah, but I feel like I need
to show her that,

22:53.207 --> 22:57.127
you know, I'm paying attention somehow.

22:58.670 --> 22:59.713
What are you thinking?

23:01.798 --> 23:04.426
I like the big romantic gesture.

23:04.426 --> 23:05.552
Does she?

23:05.552 --> 23:06.929
Don't you?

23:07.513 --> 23:08.639
Doesn't everyone?

23:09.139 --> 23:12.726
My partner and I can have sometimes
different ideas of what's romantic.

23:13.435 --> 23:14.561
You're married.

23:15.979 --> 23:20.442
The other night, when we were
waiting for Charlie in the emergency room,

23:22.402 --> 23:24.488
I saw these marks on his arm.

23:25.072 --> 23:26.031
Like an injury?

23:26.740 --> 23:27.908
Like needle marks.

23:27.908 --> 23:29.243
Like track marks?

23:32.454 --> 23:34.081
You really buried the lede.

23:36.041 --> 23:38.335
- Did you ask him?
- No.

23:39.127 --> 23:43.006
And he's been out
all the time at night recently.

23:43.006 --> 23:46.677
He says that it's for these
sales meetings, but I don't know.

23:49.096 --> 23:50.138
I should talk to him.

23:50.138 --> 23:51.723
No, don't.

23:52.474 --> 23:55.102
No, he'll lie and you'll tip him off.

23:56.603 --> 23:57.604
You need to follow him.

23:59.606 --> 24:00.858
- Really?
- Yes.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.402
Find out what's really going on.

24:06.154 --> 24:07.155
No.

24:08.407 --> 24:09.783
I'll talk to him.

24:12.369 --> 24:14.162
By the way, how did you hear about me?

24:16.373 --> 24:17.791
An ex-girlfriend.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.002
It's a long story.

24:31.221 --> 24:32.222
Hey.

24:33.807 --> 24:35.267
I was hoping we could talk.

24:36.351 --> 24:39.438
I would love that, but I'm headed out.

24:39.438 --> 24:41.064
Where you going?

24:41.064 --> 24:42.357
Where are we going?

24:43.734 --> 24:48.488
That's for me to know,
and you to find out.

24:56.205 --> 24:58.207
Is there dinner involved in this?

24:58.207 --> 25:00.417
- Yes, yes.
- Okay.

25:00.417 --> 25:04.129
But first,
we just need to pop in somewhere.

25:04.880 --> 25:08.550
There's just one quick stop first.

25:09.092 --> 25:10.302
We are here.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.810
You brought me to the charity auction?

25:19.436 --> 25:20.938
- Yes.
- No.

25:20.938 --> 25:25.067
No, I just want to sh-- One thing.
I want you to see one thing really quick.

25:25.067 --> 25:26.652
- I don't understand.
- Come on.

25:46.255 --> 25:47.256
Why are we here?

25:47.256 --> 25:48.841
Trust me. Just trust me.

25:54.054 --> 25:56.348
Hi. How are you? Nice to see you. Hi.

25:56.348 --> 25:57.474
Good to see you.

26:02.062 --> 26:05.566
- Okay. Right behind you.
- What is?

26:16.159 --> 26:17.995
- Take me home.
- What's the matter?

26:17.995 --> 26:19.079
I wanna go home.

26:27.713 --> 26:31.967
Okay, listen, I know that I messed up.

26:31.967 --> 26:34.845
I seriously don't know how.

26:35.679 --> 26:36.722
You don't get how?

26:36.722 --> 26:38.640
No. I thought you would be happy.

26:39.725 --> 26:41.059
Yeah.

26:41.977 --> 26:42.978
No.

26:43.854 --> 26:45.189
No, I'm not happy.

26:46.398 --> 26:49.776
I'm really, really fucking humiliated.

26:49.776 --> 26:53.030
Humiliat-- The painting is great.

26:53.030 --> 26:59.203
And you took it without my permission,
and you asked my colleagues to hang it.

26:59.203 --> 27:00.579
They were happy to hang it. They--

27:00.579 --> 27:03.081
They had no choice but to hang it.

27:04.333 --> 27:07.461
And then you put me
in this dress that I hate,

27:07.461 --> 27:11.340
and you took me there
where everyone knows me.

27:11.840 --> 27:13.967
And not only was that painting bad,

27:14.635 --> 27:16.637
it wasn't even finished.

27:16.637 --> 27:17.930
That painting is good.

27:17.930 --> 27:21.183
- It's great. It's great!
- That is not your decision, Jason.

27:21.183 --> 27:22.809
It is my work.

27:24.228 --> 27:25.437
And it's private.

27:25.437 --> 27:27.397
And I told you that
I didn't want to sell it.

27:27.397 --> 27:30.067
All right, so don't sell it!
Don't fucking sell it.

27:30.067 --> 27:33.195
Just-- I don't see
why people can't see it.

27:33.195 --> 27:35.864
Because I haven't painted in years!

27:37.282 --> 27:40.744
Because I'm still trying to figure out
if I even want to anymore!

27:42.704 --> 27:45.040
How could you even think it would be okay?

27:45.040 --> 27:49.753
Maybe you're just not the person
I thought you were.

27:52.172 --> 27:54.216
I didn't mean that like that.

27:54.216 --> 27:55.300
I didn't--

27:58.011 --> 27:59.096
Maybe I'm not.

28:02.474 --> 28:04.059
I just want you to be happy.

28:04.059 --> 28:05.853
Please. You want you to be happy.

31:25.260 --> 31:26.803
What is this?

31:27.763 --> 31:29.640
I think he's been injecting it.

31:30.599 --> 31:32.476
What? You mean, like, drugs? No.

31:33.101 --> 31:34.228
He has marks.

31:37.523 --> 31:38.524
Shit.

31:41.527 --> 31:45.739
Okay, wait. Maybe he's sick
and doesn't want to worry you.

31:45.739 --> 31:47.616
He's trying out some experimental drug.

31:47.616 --> 31:50.202
I think secret illness is a reach.

31:52.037 --> 31:54.414
Although he has a storage unit
that he didn't tell me about.

31:54.414 --> 31:56.166
- Really? What's in that?
- That.

31:57.334 --> 31:59.169
I don't know what else. I couldn't get in.

32:01.839 --> 32:03.423
Can you sequence it?

32:06.552 --> 32:08.720
It's not much of a sample, but, yeah.

32:11.056 --> 32:15.727
Maybe just find out what it is,
and then we figure out what to do.

32:33.954 --> 32:35.163
Are you okay?

32:37.916 --> 32:38.917
Yeah.

32:40.711 --> 32:44.965
Just think I need a day for myself.

32:44.965 --> 32:46.800
Can we meet back here tonight?

32:49.636 --> 32:52.306
And what if this is my world?

32:53.765 --> 32:56.435
Either way, meet me here tonight?

33:33.055 --> 33:34.056
Can I help you?

33:39.102 --> 33:40.896
Are you the artist?

33:43.941 --> 33:45.400
It's amazing.

33:46.068 --> 33:47.194
Thanks.

33:47.194 --> 33:48.403
This--

33:50.072 --> 33:54.701
It reminds me of Juneway Beach,
for some reason.

33:55.911 --> 33:56.995
It is.

34:00.457 --> 34:05.462
Yeah, it's like the fall or something.

34:06.839 --> 34:08.257
November, actually.

34:10.884 --> 34:12.177
I like the sunrises.

34:12.177 --> 34:13.344
Yeah.

34:15.514 --> 34:19.016
Well, I'll let you just walk around.
I'll be over here.

34:19.016 --> 34:21.018
If you have any more questions
just let me know.

34:22.062 --> 34:26.149
My wife is an artist.

34:28.527 --> 34:31.196
- Is she local?
- Yeah. Yeah. Well--

34:32.656 --> 34:34.867
Actually, no...

34:36.618 --> 34:37.619
technically.

34:37.619 --> 34:39.121
So, we're not together.

34:39.955 --> 34:42.541
So-- Well, no,
it's not that we're not together.

34:43.166 --> 34:44.376
It's--

34:44.376 --> 34:45.543
Complicated.

34:48.045 --> 34:49.047
Yeah.

34:50.132 --> 34:53.467
Hey, would you grab a coffee
with me or something?

34:54.928 --> 34:58.891
Well, I'm kind of stuck here all day.

34:58.891 --> 35:03.896
Okay. Or, you know, like,
after you get off, or...

35:05.606 --> 35:08.859
Or-- This is--
That's you letting me down easy.

35:11.862 --> 35:13.113
- I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

35:15.199 --> 35:18.744
Yeah. Fuck. Fuck, sorry.

35:19.411 --> 35:21.538
All good. Thanks for coming in.

35:21.538 --> 35:23.332
Thank you. Thank you.

35:28.086 --> 35:30.339
Hi. Can I help you?

35:41.391 --> 35:42.476
You're dressed.

36:01.203 --> 36:02.246
Great.

36:11.046 --> 36:12.381
Tickle time, tickle time.

36:24.476 --> 36:25.686
Not your world?

36:34.319 --> 36:36.321
Soon we'll be out of ampoules

36:37.865 --> 36:38.949
and options.

36:42.870 --> 36:43.871
Yeah.

37:04.308 --> 37:05.475
May I?

37:11.982 --> 37:13.066
Thank you.

37:24.369 --> 37:28.707
You're writing about her hair length,
color, job description.

37:30.709 --> 37:32.127
I don't think it's enough.

37:32.127 --> 37:34.963
- I'm doing the best that I can.
- I know you are,

37:36.632 --> 37:38.300
but I think you need to go deeper.

37:40.302 --> 37:41.303
Yeah.

37:47.643 --> 37:49.520
I think I need to get some air.

37:50.646 --> 37:52.898
Bring us some food or something.
I'll be back.

39:06.847 --> 39:10.350
Yeah, last name Dessen. D-E-S-S-E-N.

39:11.268 --> 39:12.686
Okay. Thank you.

39:20.777 --> 39:21.820
Hey.

39:28.285 --> 39:29.745
Thought you'd left me.

39:31.538 --> 39:34.291
Sorry. I promise I would never leave you.

39:35.459 --> 39:36.919
Where have you been?

39:38.670 --> 39:43.467
I've been watching myself,
following myself.

39:44.259 --> 39:49.556
Followed Daniela and I to a restaurant,
sat outside the window just watching.

39:49.556 --> 39:51.225
Then they went to a movie.

39:52.476 --> 39:55.312
I went to the theater,
I sat behind them up the back,

39:55.312 --> 39:57.231
watching them watch a fucking movie.

39:59.107 --> 40:04.321
And I started to understand how
your Jason did what he did to me.

40:04.321 --> 40:06.532
He must have watched me for fucking weeks.

40:07.533 --> 40:11.203
At work,
followed me and Daniela to date night,

40:11.787 --> 40:14.915
watching us through the window,
moving through the house at fucking night,

40:14.915 --> 40:19.002
imagining me gone,
imagining me fucking gone.

40:19.002 --> 40:23.131
I'm having some fucking crazy thoughts
right now.

40:25.634 --> 40:27.135
This isn't working.

40:27.135 --> 40:28.262
Yeah.

40:29.096 --> 40:30.305
We're spinning our wheels.

40:30.305 --> 40:32.099
Yeah, but, you see, we're getting closer.

40:32.099 --> 40:33.892
- Oh, Jason.
- So-- Don't-- No, no.

40:33.892 --> 40:37.771
Think about where we started,
and we're getting so much closer.

40:38.355 --> 40:40.148
The world you're looking for...

40:42.109 --> 40:44.736
is a grain of sand on an infinite beach.

40:44.736 --> 40:46.905
No, don't you-- don't say that.

40:46.905 --> 40:49.616
Jason. Jason.

40:51.243 --> 40:53.036
You've seen your wife murdered.

40:53.704 --> 40:56.665
You've seen her die of a horrible disease.

40:56.665 --> 40:58.375
Seen her not recognize you.

40:58.959 --> 41:01.420
Married to other men.
Married to other versions of you.

41:02.838 --> 41:05.716
Our brains weren't built for that, okay?

41:07.009 --> 41:09.094
How much more of this can you take?

41:09.094 --> 41:14.057
No, it doesn't matter how much I can or
can't take, it's about finding my Daniela.

41:14.057 --> 41:16.810
We have ten ampoules left.

41:16.810 --> 41:17.895
Ten.

41:23.275 --> 41:24.359
Maybe you're right.

41:24.359 --> 41:27.905
- It is fucking impossible.
- It's not. Look at me. It's not.

41:29.489 --> 41:31.408
I'm not asking you to give up hope.

41:32.284 --> 41:34.745
All I'm saying is that
we need to try something different.

41:42.336 --> 41:44.129
I understand why she's mad.

41:44.755 --> 41:48.258
It's her choice if and when
she ever shows her art to anyone.

41:49.051 --> 41:50.802
That's just what she said.

41:51.845 --> 41:53.430
What are you feeling right now?

41:54.598 --> 41:59.186
Honestly, like I wanna leave.

42:00.312 --> 42:01.647
Because of this fight?

42:02.439 --> 42:04.358
Well, because of everything.

42:05.067 --> 42:10.948
I worked my ass off to get here,
and it's just all turning to shit.

42:13.408 --> 42:15.953
What do you think about
when you think about leaving?

42:20.165 --> 42:24.169
A corridor, infinitely long,

42:25.128 --> 42:30.676
with all these doors, evenly spaced,
as far as the eye can see.

42:32.052 --> 42:36.557
And behind each one of these doors
is a version of my life

42:36.557 --> 42:38.350
that I could have lived.

42:40.018 --> 42:45.607
If I don't like the version I'm in,
I can just walk through another door.

42:45.607 --> 42:47.818
That's an interesting metaphor.

42:49.361 --> 42:50.445
Might have to steal it.

42:51.864 --> 42:52.948
It's all yours.

42:53.615 --> 42:55.701
You talk about all these doors,

42:56.827 --> 42:59.454
and maybe that's where
you feel most comfortable,

42:59.454 --> 43:01.248
living in a corridor.

43:03.417 --> 43:05.127
Know what another name for that is?

43:06.253 --> 43:07.337
What?

43:07.337 --> 43:08.630
Fear of commitment.

43:09.548 --> 43:12.467
I have been married for 15 years.

43:14.136 --> 43:16.180
You don't talk like someone who has.

43:28.775 --> 43:29.902
Hey.

43:30.903 --> 43:33.113
- Hey.
- Did you think I wouldn't find out, man?

43:34.781 --> 43:36.992
- What are you talking about?
- Come on.

43:40.204 --> 43:43.415
Is that why you didn't wanna work with me,
'cause you're too busy stealing my shit?

43:44.750 --> 43:46.585
I didn't steal this from you.

43:47.252 --> 43:51.798
How could you have created this?
This compound?

43:51.798 --> 43:56.512
Jay, it's like you--
you looked inside my brain.

43:56.512 --> 44:02.518
Ryan, I swear to you, I haven't
been anywhere near your research.

44:10.526 --> 44:13.612
What about somebody that works for you?

44:14.738 --> 44:15.739
No.

44:16.323 --> 44:17.908
You know when the lawyers get involved,

44:17.908 --> 44:20.702
they are gonna comb through every
facet of your life, all your work product,

44:20.702 --> 44:22.704
your labs, anything you've touched.

44:22.704 --> 44:24.540
Doesn't have to come to that, Ryan.

44:24.540 --> 44:30.212
Jason, I am in prenegotiations with
multiple pharmaceutical companies.

44:30.212 --> 44:32.506
If they find out
there's competing biotech,

44:33.090 --> 44:34.424
it's all over.

44:35.551 --> 44:36.969
Who gave you my ampoule?

44:37.594 --> 44:38.595
Why does that matter?

44:41.682 --> 44:43.350
Does your compound work?

44:46.478 --> 44:47.646
We are so close.

44:50.941 --> 44:52.526
Well, what's your application?

44:55.237 --> 44:57.656
Safer alternative to general anesthesia.

44:58.574 --> 45:01.326
Therapy for trauma. Therapy for phobias.

45:01.827 --> 45:05.289
A whole new way of thinking
about pain management.

45:05.289 --> 45:06.707
Does yours work?

45:07.749 --> 45:10.419
Yeah, it does. It works.

45:15.257 --> 45:16.258
Wow.

45:18.177 --> 45:19.928
How'd you target the Brodmann areas?

45:22.931 --> 45:24.600
I can't say.

45:24.600 --> 45:25.767
Come on.

45:28.228 --> 45:29.229
Okay.

45:30.898 --> 45:33.692
Can you at least tell me
what your application is?

45:43.660 --> 45:44.703
How about this?

45:47.664 --> 45:49.166
Why don't I just show you?

45:54.004 --> 45:55.172
What the fuck is that?

45:56.715 --> 45:58.133
That's my secret project.

45:59.510 --> 46:00.552
What's it for?

46:03.972 --> 46:05.182
I'm about to show you.

46:25.327 --> 46:26.662
Holy shit, Jay.

46:31.500 --> 46:34.753
Wait, you want me
to put that in my veins too?

46:34.753 --> 46:36.338
Only if you wanna know how it works.

46:36.338 --> 46:37.840
Is it safe?

46:40.467 --> 46:42.761
Yeah. I've done it over a hundred times.

46:54.356 --> 46:55.274
Okay.

47:19.214 --> 47:23.135
I don't understand what I'm seeing.
Jay, what is this?

47:23.135 --> 47:27.055
Well, this is a manifestation of your mind

47:27.055 --> 47:32.311
as it tries to visually explain something
our brains haven't evolved to comprehend.

47:33.187 --> 47:34.605
Which is what?

47:35.606 --> 47:39.109
A five-dimensional probability space,

47:40.068 --> 47:43.363
also known as superposition.

47:45.699 --> 47:46.700
Jay...

47:48.911 --> 47:51.413
are you saying
I'm in a quantum state right now?

47:52.247 --> 47:55.501
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Jay.

47:55.501 --> 47:57.586
Now, it looks like a corridor,

47:58.670 --> 48:02.799
but it's actually the box repeating itself
across all possible realities

48:02.799 --> 48:07.346
that share the same coordinates
of space and time.

48:07.346 --> 48:08.680
This can't be--

48:12.142 --> 48:13.268
This is real.

48:14.102 --> 48:15.187
Jason.

48:16.813 --> 48:17.898
Oh, my--

48:19.149 --> 48:20.651
What's behind the doors?

48:20.651 --> 48:23.820
An infinite amount of variations
of the world you know.

48:24.530 --> 48:27.366
Some subtly different and some
that'll blow your fucking mind.

48:31.870 --> 48:33.455
Fuck.

48:33.455 --> 48:35.249
- Wait, wait. No.
- What?

48:35.249 --> 48:36.333
This--

48:37.626 --> 48:39.294
Okay, this is the dangerous part.

48:40.379 --> 48:43.131
Aspects of your consciousness,
like your emotional state...

48:43.131 --> 48:44.132
Okay.

48:44.132 --> 48:47.678
...determine which reality
we find when we open a door.

48:49.888 --> 48:53.141
- Fuck. Of course we do--
- So, all I need you to do is concentrate.

48:53.141 --> 48:56.395
- I know you're excited...
- I'm trying, buddy. I'm trying. Okay.

48:56.395 --> 48:57.479
Breathe in.

48:59.857 --> 49:00.858
And out.

49:03.777 --> 49:04.820
Ready?

49:34.266 --> 49:35.601
This is Chicago?

49:36.727 --> 49:38.478
It's a different version of Chicago.

49:40.564 --> 49:44.109
It's a kinder and more progressive place
than our world.

49:50.199 --> 49:53.410
Okay, so why-- How did we end up here?

49:54.828 --> 49:58.457
I just thought of the kind of place
that my friend would like to see.

50:04.963 --> 50:07.257
There are so many things I could show you.

50:15.307 --> 50:18.685
We can't stay long.

50:19.478 --> 50:22.272
You give me your phone,
I'll take a picture.

50:22.773 --> 50:23.774
Yeah.

50:38.038 --> 50:42.459
Jason, I can't believe
you built a better compound than me.

50:46.129 --> 50:49.466
I really thought I was the only one
in the world with the know-how to make it.

50:51.718 --> 50:56.265
Well, there are many, many, many worlds.

51:02.312 --> 51:04.398
And there are many, many Ryans.

51:25.377 --> 51:27.462
You're not the Jason I know, are you?

51:32.676 --> 51:33.677
Hey...

51:35.971 --> 51:39.641
I won't be a problem for you, all right?

51:45.480 --> 51:49.359
No, wait. Wait. Wait. Wait!

51:51.153 --> 51:52.112
No, wait.

51:54.990 --> 51:56.074
Jay!

52:47.501 --> 52:48.627
Jason?

52:49.628 --> 52:50.963
Yeah, that's me.

52:50.963 --> 52:52.130
I'm Anthony.

52:52.130 --> 52:54.174
- Hey.
- I'm Leighton's guy.

52:54.174 --> 52:56.885
Yeah. Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

52:56.885 --> 52:59.304
- Think you'll be able to do that?
- Absolutely.

52:59.304 --> 53:02.266
What we'll do is,
we'll start out with framing it up.

53:02.266 --> 53:03.559
Get some guys--
