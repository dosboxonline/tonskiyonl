WEBVTT

00:21.980 --> 00:25.590
DOWNFALL

00:25.630 --> 00:31.360
I feel as if I should be angry
with that child, that...

00:31.880 --> 00:36.050
naive young girl.
Or that I must not forgive her...

00:36.570 --> 00:40.210
for not recognising the
nature of that monster.

00:41.260 --> 00:44.170
For not being aware of what
she was getting into.

00:44.690 --> 00:48.340
And especially that I went
along without thinking.

00:48.860 --> 00:55.110
Because I wasn't a fanatical Nazi.
I could have said, in Berlin:

00:55.110 --> 00:59.790
'No, I'm not doing it. I don't want
to go to the Fuhrer's headquarters.'

01:00.830 --> 01:03.960
But I didn't do that.
I was too curious.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.600
I also didn't realise...

01:08.650 --> 01:13.850
that destiny would take me somewhere
I didn't want to be.

01:14.890 --> 01:20.620
But, nevertheless, I find it hard
to forgive myself.

01:26.690 --> 01:27.730
The ladies are here.

01:29.810 --> 01:33.460
It's confirmed.
-They can pass.

02:02.490 --> 02:05.620
'Wolfsschanze'
headquarters of the Fuhrer

02:06.660 --> 02:08.220
November 1942
Rastenburg, East-Prussia

02:11.860 --> 02:13.950
Sit down, ladies.

02:15.510 --> 02:20.720
One moment. The Fuhrer is feeding
his dog. He'll see you in a short while.

02:22.800 --> 02:27.490
Can you tell us... How are we supposed
to address the Fuhrer?

02:28.530 --> 02:32.690
The Fuhrer first speaks to you
and then you reply: Heil, mein Fuhrer.

02:32.690 --> 02:34.780
And the Nazi salute?

02:34.780 --> 02:37.380
That won't be necessary...

02:37.380 --> 02:42.590
since the Fuhrer isn't looking for
a soldier, but for a secretary.

02:43.110 --> 02:45.710
Act as normal and calm
as you can.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.830
I'll see if
he has time for you.

02:53.000 --> 02:56.120
Mein Fuhrer,
the ladies from Berlin are here.

03:14.880 --> 03:20.600
Thank you for coming
in the middle of the night.

03:21.130 --> 03:25.810
Sometimes, during a war,
one is not in control of time.

03:27.820 --> 03:31.460
Can I ask your name?
-Margarethe Lorenz.

03:31.980 --> 03:34.580
Where are you from?
-From Fulda.

03:35.110 --> 03:38.750
And what is your name?
-Ursula Puttkammer. Heil, mein Fuhrer.

03:39.270 --> 03:42.400
No need for that.
Where are you from?

03:42.920 --> 03:45.000
Frankfurt am Main, mein Fuh...

03:47.080 --> 03:49.170
Hannah Potrovsky,
born and raised in Berlin.

03:50.210 --> 03:52.290
In Pankow, to be precise.

03:53.330 --> 03:55.930
Hedwig Brandt
from Crailsheim, Schwaben.

03:57.500 --> 04:01.140
And you are?
-Traudl Humps. I'm from Munich.

04:04.270 --> 04:05.830
A lady from Munich.

04:13.120 --> 04:16.760
Shall we start then,
Fraulein Humps?

04:27.700 --> 04:31.340
My Blondi won't hurt you.
She's very intelligent.

04:31.870 --> 04:35.510
She's much smarter
than most people.

04:40.200 --> 04:43.320
First, sit down, please.

04:43.840 --> 04:48.010
Don't be nervous. I make
many mistakes during dictation.

04:48.010 --> 04:51.650
You won't make nearly as many.

05:01.030 --> 05:02.590
You're very young.

05:02.590 --> 05:07.810
How old are you?
-22, mein Fuhrer.

05:12.500 --> 05:16.670
My German fellow-countrymen
and women...

05:17.720 --> 05:18.760
...fellow party members.

05:18.760 --> 05:23.460
It is, I think, rather special...

05:23.980 --> 05:30.240
that, after 20 years of service, a man still
stands in front of his supporters...

05:33.370 --> 05:40.150
...and that in all those 20 years,
his program never needed to be modified.

05:55.280 --> 05:58.930
I suggest we try it again.

06:11.220 --> 06:13.300
I did it.
He hired me.

06:30.000 --> 06:32.600
Berlin - 20 April 1945
Hitler's 56th birthday

06:33.130 --> 06:34.690
two and a half years later

06:35.210 --> 06:36.260
Take cover.

06:40.900 --> 06:44.550
Hurry. Continue.
Get that off the street.

06:46.930 --> 06:47.970
Take cover.

07:01.100 --> 07:02.150
That's artillery fire.

07:02.670 --> 07:06.840
Don't be silly.
Where would it be coming from?

07:07.360 --> 07:09.970
You're right. These are no planes,
this is artillery.

07:11.020 --> 07:15.710
It's the Russians.
What a birthday present.

07:19.880 --> 07:21.970
Where is that cannon fire coming from?

07:22.490 --> 07:25.100
Happy Birthday,
mein Fuhrer.

07:25.620 --> 07:27.710
The city centre of Berlin
is under fire.

07:28.940 --> 07:32.590
Grenades have hit near the Brandenburger
Tor and the Reichstag.

07:32.930 --> 07:35.530
Where did they come from?
-We don't know yet.

07:36.060 --> 07:39.190
I have Koller on the line.
-Give me Koller.

07:39.710 --> 07:43.880
Koller, do you know Berlin
is under artillery fire?

07:44.930 --> 07:47.530
No.
-Can't you hear the shooting?

07:48.050 --> 07:51.180
No, I'm in Wildpark-Werder.
-Berlin is chaotic.

07:51.710 --> 07:54.310
Apparently, the Russians captured
a railway bridge over the Oder.

07:55.360 --> 07:58.490
The enemy has no railway
artillery near the Oder.

07:59.010 --> 08:01.100
It's not long-range artillery.

08:01.100 --> 08:06.310
The anti-aircraft defence near the
Zoo-Bunker reports they're 10 to 12...

08:06.320 --> 08:11.010
...cm calibres. The Russians have
positions near Marzahn.

08:11.010 --> 08:15.700
That's only 12 kilometres from the centre.
Are the Russians that close?

08:16.230 --> 08:19.880
They should hang the entire
Luftwaffe leadership.

08:21.420 --> 08:24.020
This is unheard-of.

08:24.570 --> 08:27.180
The Russians are at 12 kilometres
from the city centre.

08:28.230 --> 08:30.830
Nobody told me anything.
I had to ask.

08:31.880 --> 08:34.480
Maybe it's long-range artillery,
after all.

08:35.010 --> 08:38.140
That railway bridge over the Oder...
-Nonsense.

08:44.400 --> 08:47.000
That Himmler,
such a pompous buffoon.

08:47.530 --> 08:53.260
Party bosses, everywhere.
They make me so sick.

08:55.870 --> 08:57.960
The Fuhrer starts
'Clausewitz' today.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.640
Berlin as a front city.
He won't be able to keep the city.

09:03.160 --> 09:06.290
If the Fuhrer stays here,
the Reich will go down with him.

09:06.810 --> 09:10.450
We have to talk him out of it.
Talk to Hewel.

09:10.450 --> 09:14.090
He's the only diplomat
with any influence on him.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.740
Hewel tried everything.
It's useless.

09:18.260 --> 09:20.860
Talk to your sister-in-law, then.

09:21.380 --> 09:26.590
Why not? You're married
to the sister of Eva Braun.

09:27.110 --> 09:30.750
We must try everything.
Berlin is almost surrounded.

09:30.750 --> 09:33.880
You're still young.
You'll be a father soon.

09:34.400 --> 09:37.000
Do you want to die here?
-Absolutely not.

09:42.210 --> 09:44.290
Gentlemen, the Fuhrer.

09:55.140 --> 09:58.790
Everything out. Quickly.
We're leaving in two hours.

10:06.950 --> 10:10.080
What's going on?
-We're leaving.

10:12.160 --> 10:13.720
'Clausewitz' has started.

10:14.160 --> 10:17.810
All the ministries and departments
are leaving Berlin.

10:18.410 --> 10:21.530
And who's going to look after
the people and the soldiers?

10:22.570 --> 10:26.210
Don't ask me, professor.
-This is insane.

10:43.950 --> 10:46.030
Professor.

10:47.080 --> 10:49.160
I won't allow the
evacuation of my office.

10:49.680 --> 10:53.840
Is that so?
-Food supply would collapse.

10:54.360 --> 10:56.970
A good soldier can
always find food.

10:57.490 --> 11:02.170
And when there's fighting all over the city,
where does he get it? The population.

11:03.060 --> 11:06.180
It's irresponsible.
-It's an order from the Fuhrer.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.870
As department head, I
report to the SS and to Himmler.

11:11.390 --> 11:15.550
But as a doctor, I'm part of the Wehrmacht
and they're not leaving yet.

11:16.070 --> 11:18.680
Keep that in mind.

11:23.360 --> 11:27.010
The professor stays in Berlin.
Get him the proper papers.

11:30.580 --> 11:32.140
We're leaving.

11:45.700 --> 11:48.300
Everything for Germany.
Heil, mein Fuhrer.

11:49.870 --> 11:52.470
Fuhrer, I...
Heil, mein Fuhrer.

11:53.910 --> 11:56.510
They're in such a hurry
to get away from here.

11:57.030 --> 11:59.120
The brown nosing is the worst.

11:59.640 --> 12:03.280
They say 'Sieg Heil'. but they think
'Lick my... you know what.'

12:07.370 --> 12:12.050
Mein Fuhrer, I beg you: Leave Berlin.
It is not too late yet.

12:13.090 --> 12:14.650
Too late?

12:16.220 --> 12:18.300
Hewel, come here for a moment.

12:18.930 --> 12:23.620
I'm sure you agree we should contact
the Allies...

12:24.140 --> 12:29.340
...and start conducting politics.
-Certainly. We need politics.

12:29.340 --> 12:33.510
Politics?
I don't do politics anymore.

12:33.510 --> 12:36.110
I'm fed up with it.

12:38.190 --> 12:42.360
When I'm dead, you'll have plenty
of time for politics.

12:42.880 --> 12:48.750
It's good, dear Himmler.
My loyal Heinrich.

12:48.750 --> 12:53.690
It's good.
Just go.

13:14.040 --> 13:15.600
He has no strength left.

13:16.640 --> 13:20.280
What did you expect from a
vegetarian teetotaller?

13:20.810 --> 13:24.450
Seriously, though, Fegelein.
I'm taking control now.

13:25.490 --> 13:27.570
Berlin will fall in a couple of days.

13:28.090 --> 13:32.780
When the Fuhrer's dead, who will
the Allies negotiate with?

13:32.780 --> 13:35.900
Why do you think they'll
negotiate with you?

13:36.420 --> 13:39.550
The Nazi state and my SS are needed
to maintain order.

13:40.590 --> 13:42.670
One hour with Eisenhower
and he'll feel the same way.

13:43.710 --> 13:47.870
The first contact has been made.
-Careful, that's high treason.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.000
Fegelein, I have other concerns.

13:51.000 --> 13:56.200
Should I give Eisenhower the Nazi salute
or shake his hand?

14:02.810 --> 14:04.370
Look at that.

14:07.500 --> 14:09.070
The best guests
always arrive late.

14:09.590 --> 14:14.800
Leaving already, gentlemen?
I wanted to talk to you.

14:15.330 --> 14:20.020
The scorched-earth order...
-I really have to go now.

14:20.020 --> 14:23.150
Come and see me one day
in Hohenlychen.

14:25.760 --> 14:30.970
I'm going north to help with the
battle of Berlin there.

14:40.890 --> 14:45.590
You know, Speer... There's an
advantage to those bombings.

14:46.110 --> 14:51.320
It's easier to clean up debris
than to demolish everything ourselves.

14:52.890 --> 14:56.540
When the war will be over,
reconstruction will be quick.

14:58.110 --> 15:03.840
We spent thousands of hours
together with these replicas.

15:05.410 --> 15:08.540
You're a true genius, Speer.

15:10.100 --> 15:15.840
Yes, absolutely. Only you and I know that
the Third Reich would be inconceivable...

15:16.360 --> 15:21.060
...with only warehouses and factories.
Skyscrapers and hotels.

15:22.100 --> 15:26.270
This Third Reich will be a treasury
full of art and culture...

15:26.800 --> 15:29.930
...that will survive thousands of years.

15:29.930 --> 15:34.410
We see, before us, the ancient cities,
the Acropolis...

15:34.930 --> 15:37.540
We see the medieval cities...
the cathedrals...

15:37.540 --> 15:42.240
...and we know that the people
need that.

15:45.370 --> 15:47.970
Indeed, Speer.

15:50.580 --> 15:52.670
That was my vision...

15:54.240 --> 15:56.840
...and it still is.

15:59.450 --> 16:04.670
Mein Fuhrer, if you want to realize
these plans, you must leave Berlin.

16:10.410 --> 16:13.010
Eva, you say something.

16:13.540 --> 16:16.670
He's the Fuhrer.
He knows what's best.

16:17.190 --> 16:21.880
You must leave Berlin.
The Russians almost have us isolated.

16:22.400 --> 16:24.490
I can't do that, my child.

16:25.010 --> 16:30.230
I would be like a lama priest
with an empty prayer wheel.

16:30.230 --> 16:36.250
I have to solve the problem,
here in Berlin, or perish.

16:37.820 --> 16:38.860
Speer...

16:41.470 --> 16:43.040
...what do you think?

16:44.600 --> 16:47.730
You have to be on the stage
when the curtain falls.

17:06.079 --> 17:07.130
Reload.

17:17.710 --> 17:19.800
Go away. Leave me alone.

17:20.319 --> 17:23.970
How old are you? Twelve?
And you? Fourteen?

17:24.490 --> 17:27.619
Why are you here?
To play at war? Go home.

17:28.140 --> 17:31.790
Who are you? What do you want?
I want my son. Alive.

17:32.310 --> 17:35.440
You should be proud.
He destroyed two tanks.

17:35.970 --> 17:39.090
The Fuhrer will decorate him
for it, today.

17:39.620 --> 17:42.750
You're still young.
At which front did you fight?

17:43.790 --> 17:45.350
I haven't had
the honour yet.

17:45.880 --> 17:50.570
Count yourself lucky.
Send the children home.

17:51.620 --> 17:53.700
We'll defend this position
to the last man.

17:54.220 --> 17:57.350
Which position?
This is not a position, it's a trap.

17:58.400 --> 18:01.530
The Russians will come from two sides
and you won't be able to get out.

18:02.050 --> 18:04.130
We'll shoot back.
-What with?

18:05.180 --> 18:06.740
With the anti-aircraft guns.

18:07.270 --> 18:10.920
The Russians will arrive with several
armies, tanks and heavy artillery.

18:11.440 --> 18:15.610
Do you really think you'll
last even five minutes?

18:16.130 --> 18:18.740
We promised the Fuhrer.

18:19.260 --> 18:22.390
Don't you understand?
The war is lost.

18:22.920 --> 18:23.960
Coward.

18:28.660 --> 18:30.740
Go away. Right now.

18:32.310 --> 18:36.480
If you're still here when the Russians
arrive, you'll all be dead.

18:40.130 --> 18:45.870
The 9th army had to retreat
or they would have been decimated...

18:46.400 --> 18:51.610
We won't retreat the 9th army.
Busse must fight where he stands.

18:52.130 --> 18:54.740
Fuhrer, then the 9th army is lost.

18:55.270 --> 19:00.480
We'll push back the Soviet armies
in the north and east...

19:00.480 --> 19:05.180
...with a ruthless, mighty attack.

19:06.220 --> 19:07.260
Using which units?

19:08.310 --> 19:13.000
Steiner will attack from the north
and join the 9th army.

19:15.090 --> 19:17.700
The 9th army is unable to move.

19:18.220 --> 19:20.310
The enemy outnumbers us ten times.

19:21.350 --> 19:23.960
Wenck's 12th army must
support them.

19:24.480 --> 19:29.700
The 12th army is approaching the Elbe.
-Then it must turn around.

19:30.220 --> 19:34.390
Then the western front would be open.
-Do you doubt my orders?

19:34.920 --> 19:38.570
I think I've been
clear enough.

19:40.130 --> 19:47.440
The Allies will see that only we
can stop the Bolsheviks.

19:47.960 --> 19:52.660
We have to keep Berlin and
make a deal with the Americans.

20:11.960 --> 20:15.090
Mohnke, you're here.
-Mein Fuhrer.

20:16.660 --> 20:21.350
Today, 'Clausewitz' started.
Berlin will be a front city.

20:21.870 --> 20:26.570
You will be the commander of the
defensive circle around the citadel.

20:27.090 --> 20:31.270
We'll fight until the last man, in Berlin.

20:31.790 --> 20:35.960
There are still three million civilians here.
They have to be evacuated.

20:37.530 --> 20:43.790
I understand your concern, Mohnke.
But we have to be cold as ice.

20:44.310 --> 20:47.960
We can't spend any energy
on so-called civilians.

20:49.530 --> 20:53.700
With all due respect, what will
happen to the women and children...

20:54.220 --> 20:56.830
...and the thousands of wounded
and elderly?

20:57.350 --> 21:01.000
In a war such as this one,
there are no civilians.

21:02.050 --> 21:04.140
The Fuhrer has lost all
sense of reality.

21:04.660 --> 21:07.790
He's moving divisions around
that no longer exist.

21:08.310 --> 21:13.530
Gruppe Steiner has been scattered,
yet Steiner must attack. Madness.

21:14.050 --> 21:17.700
But why don't you tell him that?
-He doesn't listen to reason.

21:18.220 --> 21:22.400
Something has to happen.
-Are you crazy? He'll throw us out.

21:25.010 --> 21:28.660
We're soldiers.
We took an oath.

21:28.660 --> 21:31.260
Does that mean we can't use
our own brains anymore?

21:31.790 --> 21:34.920
And that's coming from you?
A ruthless careerist?

21:35.960 --> 21:37.010
I beg your pardon?

22:02.220 --> 22:04.310
Where were you?
-None of your business.

22:13.250 --> 22:17.420
The most successful tank hunters of the
Berlin Hitler-Jugend stand before you.

22:26.770 --> 22:27.820
I'm proud of you.

22:31.470 --> 22:35.640
This boy took out two tanks
using anti-tank shells.

22:36.170 --> 22:40.860
His name is Peter Kranz.
-So you're Peter.

22:42.950 --> 22:46.600
I wish my generals were
as brave as you.

22:56.510 --> 22:57.550
Very good.

23:04.100 --> 23:06.180
You've made history.

23:06.700 --> 23:11.400
And when Germania will rise
from these ruins...

23:11.920 --> 23:14.010
...you will be the heroes.

23:15.570 --> 23:17.660
Heil, to you.

23:47.400 --> 23:51.570
I don't know about you,
but I prefer air raids.

23:52.610 --> 23:57.310
What will happen to us?
-I could go if I wanted to.

23:57.830 --> 24:02.530
But everybody is deserting him.
We can't all go, can we?

24:03.050 --> 24:04.610
I can't go either.

24:10.340 --> 24:12.940
I wouldn't know
where to go.

24:13.460 --> 24:18.140
My parents and all
my friends warned me.

24:18.670 --> 24:21.270
Don't get involved with the Nazis.

24:21.790 --> 24:24.910
What should I say:
'Hello, I made a mistake'?

24:24.910 --> 24:27.510
'When things went wrong,
I admitted my mistake.'

24:29.600 --> 24:32.200
Life will go on.

24:40.640 --> 24:43.770
What do you think, Herr Oberst?
-We have to go.

24:46.890 --> 24:50.020
Go where?
-I don't know.

24:50.540 --> 24:52.620
Wherever they need us.

25:04.070 --> 25:07.190
Let's go upstairs.
We'll party.

25:07.720 --> 25:08.760
Come on.

25:12.390 --> 25:13.430
Come, children.

25:20.730 --> 25:23.330
We should have fun today.

25:29.230 --> 25:34.430
Wherever the enemy goes,
all they find is destruction.

25:35.470 --> 25:38.080
That's the death sentence
for the German people.

25:39.640 --> 25:43.280
No power, no gas, no drinking
water, no coal, no traffic.

25:44.320 --> 25:51.090
If you destroy everything, our country
will go back to the Middle Ages.

25:51.610 --> 25:54.740
This order denies the people
any chance of survival.

25:55.780 --> 25:59.940
If the war is lost, what does it matter
that the people are lost too?

26:00.460 --> 26:06.190
The primary necessities of life of the
German people aren't relevant, right now.

26:06.710 --> 26:09.830
On the contrary.
We'd best destroy them ourselves.

26:10.350 --> 26:12.960
Our people turned out weak...

26:13.480 --> 26:17.120
...and according to the laws of nature,
they should die out.

26:17.640 --> 26:20.760
They're your people.
You're their Fuhrer.

26:21.290 --> 26:23.890
What remains after this battle...

26:24.410 --> 26:29.090
...is only the inferior.
The superior will have fallen.

26:36.100 --> 26:39.740
Come along. You have to dance.

26:40.260 --> 26:43.390
Care to dance, Fraulein Braun?
-I'd love to.

27:09.050 --> 27:11.130
May I?
-Go ahead.

27:12.170 --> 27:13.210
What's wrong?

27:18.420 --> 27:21.540
We have to leave Berlin, Eva.
You must convince him.

27:25.710 --> 27:27.270
Or else, come with me.

27:36.720 --> 27:37.760
You'll die.

27:58.970 --> 28:02.100
Can somebody play some music?
I want to dance.

28:02.620 --> 28:03.660
Dance.

28:07.890 --> 28:09.970
Do you have a request?
-As long as it swings.

28:38.380 --> 28:39.940
Traudl.

28:45.820 --> 28:48.420
It's all so unreal.

28:48.940 --> 28:54.660
It's like a dream you
can't get out of.

28:55.180 --> 28:56.750
It keeps on going.

29:00.910 --> 29:03.530
Gerda, I don't feel well.

29:40.150 --> 29:41.720
Traudl, come.

30:01.890 --> 30:03.460
I did not move...

30:05.550 --> 30:08.170
I did not move
my command post.

30:09.580 --> 30:11.680
To the west? How so?

30:12.720 --> 30:15.340
I'm at 1000 meters from the enemy.
-General.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.100
And, general?

30:38.100 --> 30:41.240
I'll be executed.
-What? Why?

30:42.290 --> 30:46.470
They think I moved my
command post to the west.

30:47.520 --> 30:50.130
Be sensible, general.
-Come along.

31:07.870 --> 31:09.430
Schenck.
-Mohnke.

31:09.920 --> 31:14.600
I'm under the chancellery.
I'm commander of the citadel now.

31:15.130 --> 31:19.290
I need help.
-That will be difficult. Everything's gone.

31:19.810 --> 31:21.900
My assistant and I are
the only ones here.

31:22.810 --> 31:24.890
You're a doctor, aren't you?
-Yes, an internist.

31:25.410 --> 31:29.580
Commandeer a car and
bring all the medication...

31:30.100 --> 31:32.700
...you can find, to me.

31:33.220 --> 31:36.350
I'll do my best.
-Thanks. Hurry.

32:26.540 --> 32:28.630
I need to talk to the Fuhrer.

32:29.670 --> 32:33.310
What about?
-I'm going to be executed.

32:36.960 --> 32:38.000
Wait here.

32:39.560 --> 32:40.600
Your weapon, please.

32:47.760 --> 32:48.940
Not here.

32:52.510 --> 32:56.160
Guard post 2.
Understood.

32:58.240 --> 32:59.800
General...

33:02.410 --> 33:03.970
Not you.

33:26.900 --> 33:30.020
What's going on here?
Why am I going to be executed?

33:30.550 --> 33:34.710
You know that any evasive manoeuvre
towards the west is forbidden.

33:35.230 --> 33:39.920
Officers who don't obey,
must be executed.

33:39.920 --> 33:43.560
What do you mean?
My troops have been fighting for days.

33:44.610 --> 33:48.770
My command post
is a kilometre away from the front line.

33:49.290 --> 33:50.860
Continue.

33:50.860 --> 33:55.540
Do you see this? I don't want you
to use that tone with me.

33:57.110 --> 34:00.230
And now, do whatever
you feel you must.

34:00.750 --> 34:04.920
It's best if you tell this to the
Fuhrer yourself. Come along.

34:20.260 --> 34:24.429
You can't pass, Oberst.
-Orders from brigade-fuhrer Mohnke:

34:24.429 --> 34:27.550
I have to get into the hospital.
We need medication.

34:28.070 --> 34:30.679
There's nobody left.
They all took off.

34:31.199 --> 34:33.800
And the wounded?
-How should I know?

34:34.320 --> 34:36.409
I'm going to have a look.
You stay here.

34:36.600 --> 34:40.770
Be very careful.
There are lots of Russians here.

34:41.600 --> 34:46.280
See that? That's where the
Reich ends. Behind it, is Russkie land.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.680
May I?

34:59.680 --> 35:10.600
He's damned stubborn.
Why doesn't he let me do that?

36:11.830 --> 36:15.470
I should have been back by now.
Are you sure the Fuhrer still needs me?

36:16.000 --> 36:19.120
Drink.
-Fuhrer's orders.

36:19.640 --> 36:22.740
You made a big impression
on the Fuhrer.

36:23.270 --> 36:25.350
But you don't think Steiner
will attack, do you?

36:25.870 --> 36:28.470
I doubt whether Steiner
is able to do anything...

36:28.990 --> 36:31.600
...but you probably know that
better than I do.

36:32.640 --> 36:35.760
If Steiner doesn't attack,
Berlin is lost.

36:45.440 --> 36:47.520
The Fuhrer was impressed
with your report.

36:48.040 --> 36:52.210
He puts you in command of
the defence of Berlin.

36:53.250 --> 36:57.930
I'd have preferred it
if he executed me.

37:18.860 --> 37:20.940
Let them get closer.

37:22.350 --> 37:23.920
Tank alert.

37:23.920 --> 37:28.800
Take it easy. Wait, kid.
They're still too far.

38:19.080 --> 38:22.200
Is it German artillery that I hear?
-I'm afraid not.

38:22.720 --> 38:24.810
But hasn't Steiner's
attack started?

38:28.450 --> 38:31.060
You have to go as fast as you can.
Time is running out.

38:31.580 --> 38:33.660
But the Fuhrer has
the situation under control.

38:34.700 --> 38:36.260
Steiner will make
all the difference.

38:37.310 --> 38:40.430
He says it will change
military history.

38:40.950 --> 38:44.600
Everybody, but the Fuhrer, knows
that's a fantasy.

38:45.120 --> 38:50.330
I even wonder if he believes it himself.
-Why would he be playing games?

38:50.850 --> 38:52.410
What does he have to lose?

38:53.970 --> 38:55.010
I don't believe a word of it.

38:56.060 --> 38:58.660
The enemy made a breakthrough.

38:59.180 --> 39:02.830
They took Zossen and are advancing
towards Stahnsdorf.

39:03.360 --> 39:07.000
They're at the northern city border,
between Frohnau and Pankow.

39:07.530 --> 39:12.740
In the east, they reached
Lichtenberg, Mahlsdorf and Karlshorst.

39:13.260 --> 39:16.390
If Steiner attacks,
everything will be alright.

39:20.040 --> 39:21.610
Mein Fuhrer...

39:23.170 --> 39:24.740
Steiner...

39:26.300 --> 39:28.910
Steiner didn't have enough force.

39:29.430 --> 39:32.040
The attack didn't take place.

39:48.350 --> 39:54.080
The following stay here:
Keitel, Jodl, Krebs and Burgdorf.

40:08.720 --> 40:13.930
That was an order.
Steiner's attack was an order.

40:14.450 --> 40:18.620
How dare you
ignore my orders?

40:20.710 --> 40:23.320
Is this what it came to?

40:24.880 --> 40:30.100
The military, everybody lied
to me. Even the SS.

40:30.620 --> 40:35.830
The generals are no more than
a bunch of disloyal cowards.

40:36.360 --> 40:38.440
I don't allow that...

40:38.960 --> 40:43.660
Cowards, traitors and incompetents.
-Fuhrer, this is outrageous.

40:44.180 --> 40:47.830
The generals are the scum
of the German people.

40:48.350 --> 40:50.960
No sense of honour.

40:51.480 --> 40:55.650
You call yourself general because
you spent years at the academy...

40:56.700 --> 40:59.300
...where you only learnt
to use knife and fork.

40:59.820 --> 41:04.000
For years, the military
obstructed me.

41:04.520 --> 41:08.690
All you ever did is
thwart me.

41:09.460 --> 41:12.580
I should have had...

41:13.110 --> 41:17.800
...all the high officers executed.
Like Stalin did.

41:22.530 --> 41:25.140
I never went to the academy.

41:25.140 --> 41:31.920
But I conquered all
of Europe on my own.

41:36.720 --> 41:38.280
Traitors.

41:38.800 --> 41:43.490
I've been betrayed and deceived
from the start.

41:44.020 --> 41:48.710
Such enormous betrayal
of the German people.

41:49.750 --> 41:54.970
But all these traitors will pay.
With their own blood.

41:55.940 --> 41:58.020
They will drown
in their own blood.

42:00.630 --> 42:02.190
Calm, Gerda.

42:09.750 --> 42:13.400
All my orders have
been ignored.

42:14.970 --> 42:19.140
How can I be a leader
under these circumstances?

42:20.920 --> 42:23.000
It's over.

42:26.940 --> 42:30.070
The war is lost.

42:36.090 --> 42:39.740
But if you think this means
I'll leave Berlin...

42:40.270 --> 42:44.440
...you're wrong. I'd rather
shoot a bullet through my head.

42:49.280 --> 42:51.370
Do what you want.

43:12.220 --> 43:15.870
The Fuhrer wasn't serious about
killing himself, was he?

43:16.390 --> 43:18.990
Frau Junge, Frau Christian.

43:22.650 --> 43:27.340
Get changed. In one hour,
a plane will take you south.

43:28.840 --> 43:30.920
Everything is lost.

43:31.440 --> 43:33.530
Completely lost.

43:37.180 --> 43:40.830
You know I'll stay with you.
You can't send me away.

43:53.150 --> 43:55.240
I'm staying too, mein Fuhrer.

44:19.800 --> 44:20.840
Now what?

44:21.880 --> 44:23.450
Time to end this charade.

44:24.490 --> 44:28.660
Do you want us to stop fighting?
That's inconceivable.

44:29.180 --> 44:34.390
The Fuhrer doesn't want us to capitulate.
No more November 1918. Ever.

44:34.910 --> 44:38.550
But he doesn't want to be in charge
anymore. He said: 'Do what you want'.

44:39.070 --> 44:42.200
Nobody can replace him.
He's the Fuhrer.

44:42.720 --> 44:44.800
The Fuhrer's confused.
He'll recover.

44:45.840 --> 44:48.450
Great.
And then what?

44:51.060 --> 44:54.190
No capitulation. That was
never his intention.

44:55.230 --> 44:57.840
We owe it to him.
-Hollow phrases.

44:58.360 --> 45:00.450
We have to act now.
Or it will be too late.

45:01.500 --> 45:04.100
You're only looking after yourself.
-Mind your words.

45:13.330 --> 45:14.890
Damn.

45:19.590 --> 45:23.760
We'll never get out of here alive.
It's all over.

45:24.290 --> 45:25.330
We've got to wait.

45:25.850 --> 45:29.500
Even the Fuhrer doesn't believe in it
anymore. What will happen to us?

45:30.020 --> 45:34.200
Gunsche says there's a tunnel
that goes under the Russian lines.

45:35.240 --> 45:37.850
Why did you say
you wanted to stay with him?

45:38.370 --> 45:42.020
I don't know.
Honestly.

45:44.630 --> 45:47.240
It stopped.
Let's go for a walk.

46:29.060 --> 46:30.630
Traudl.

46:31.150 --> 46:32.710
Look here.

46:55.140 --> 46:57.750
I'm lighting another one.

47:15.690 --> 47:18.300
Let's go down again.

47:48.340 --> 47:52.510
Where do they come from?
-Volkssturm. Drafted this afternoon.

47:53.040 --> 47:55.640
They have to get
out of the field of fire.

47:59.300 --> 48:03.470
The Volkssturm is under the
direct command of Dr. Goebbels.

48:06.640 --> 48:10.290
I want them to go away from there.
This is insane.

48:11.340 --> 48:12.900
I'll take the responsibility.

48:24.070 --> 48:27.720
I think this is wrong.
-Great.

48:29.290 --> 48:30.850
Stop. Lights out.

48:31.370 --> 48:33.980
Stop. Stay where you are.

48:34.500 --> 48:37.630
Stay where you are.
-Alright, Germans.

48:41.670 --> 48:45.840
Help. They want to kill us.
-What is all this?

48:45.840 --> 48:50.020
A Greifkommando.
-You're kidding.

48:59.920 --> 49:03.050
Stop it.
Let those men go.

49:03.580 --> 49:06.710
What's this?
You have no authority here.

49:07.230 --> 49:11.920
These men are on the run.
Traitors will be killed.

49:12.450 --> 49:16.100
They're old men. Civilians.
You can't do this.

49:20.950 --> 49:23.560
Who's going to stop me?
You maybe?

49:25.650 --> 49:27.730
Stop it. That's enough.

49:41.670 --> 49:43.240
Dismissed.

51:27.050 --> 51:29.130
This man's a doctor.

51:36.420 --> 51:39.030
Can you operate?
-Not really.

51:42.120 --> 51:46.290
Don't let the children
take too many toys.

51:46.810 --> 51:49.940
And not too much nightwear.
That's no longer needed.

51:50.470 --> 51:53.600
Herr Minister...
-Frau Junge, my family will arrive soon.

51:54.120 --> 51:58.280
Can you look after them for a moment?
Thank you.

51:58.800 --> 52:00.370
Brigade-fuhrer, what can I do for you?

52:00.890 --> 52:04.010
Your Volkssturm is an easy prey
for the Russians.

52:04.530 --> 52:07.130
They have neither combat experience
nor good weapons.

52:07.650 --> 52:12.860
Their unconditional belief
in the final victory makes up for that.

52:12.860 --> 52:17.540
Herr Minister, without weapons
these men can't fight.

52:18.070 --> 52:19.630
Their deaths will be pointless.

52:20.150 --> 52:22.750
I don't pity them.

52:24.310 --> 52:26.910
I repeat:
I don't pity them.

52:27.440 --> 52:30.040
The people called this
upon themselves.

52:31.080 --> 52:34.720
This may come as a surprise to you.
Don't fool yourself.

52:35.250 --> 52:38.890
We didn't force the people.
They gave us a mandate.

52:38.890 --> 52:42.530
And now they're paying for it.

52:59.560 --> 53:02.170
Eva, you have to leave the Fuhrer.

53:02.690 --> 53:04.770
Don't be stupid.
This is about life and death.

53:05.290 --> 53:07.370
How can you say that?
Where are you?

53:08.410 --> 53:11.020
I decided
not to die in Berlin.

53:11.540 --> 53:16.220
Does my sister know where you are?
-Think about it. I'll call you back.

53:18.310 --> 53:20.910
Children, your room is to the right.

53:22.990 --> 53:24.550
Wait for me.

53:26.110 --> 53:29.760
Hello, Frau Goebbels.
-Good to see you, Frau Junge.

53:42.150 --> 53:44.230
Line up, children.

53:44.750 --> 53:46.830
Helga, come. Line up.

53:47.880 --> 53:52.560
Let's make ourselves look good and
then we go say hello to uncle Hitler.

53:56.730 --> 53:58.810
Do you remember the song?

54:38.390 --> 54:42.560
The best thing to do is to
shoot yourself in the mouth.

54:46.720 --> 54:49.850
You won't feel a thing.
You'll be dead right away.

54:50.890 --> 54:53.490
I want to be a beautiful corpse.
I'll take poison.

54:54.010 --> 54:57.130
If I have to die,
at least without any pain.

54:57.650 --> 54:59.220
That's definitely painless.

54:59.740 --> 55:04.420
It paralyses the nervous system
and the respiratory system.

55:04.940 --> 55:06.500
A matter of seconds.

55:08.590 --> 55:11.710
Can I have one too?
-Me too.

55:16.910 --> 55:21.600
Himmler provided me well.

55:39.420 --> 55:41.500
Thank you.

55:42.540 --> 55:47.230
I would have liked to give you
a nicer present.

55:55.110 --> 55:59.280
Berlin, 23 April 1945.

56:02.920 --> 56:08.130
Dear sister. I'm sorry
to write you this.

56:08.650 --> 56:13.330
But this is how it is. It could
be over any moment.

56:13.850 --> 56:16.980
First of all: Hermann isn't with us.

56:17.500 --> 56:21.140
But I'm sure
you'll see him again.

56:21.660 --> 56:26.870
He'll get through this
and he'll fight from Bavaria.

56:27.390 --> 56:31.030
The Fuhrer lost all hope
of a good outcome.

56:32.590 --> 56:36.240
Dear son. I don't know
if you'll receive this letter.

56:37.280 --> 56:41.960
Maybe someone will allow me
to send you a last greeting.

56:42.490 --> 56:46.130
I stayed with daddy
against his will.

56:46.650 --> 56:49.770
Last Sunday, the Fuhrer
wanted to help me escape.

56:50.290 --> 56:52.900
But you know your mother.
We have the same blood.

56:53.420 --> 56:57.060
I won't even think about it.
Our ideology's going down the drain...

56:57.580 --> 57:02.790
...and with it, everything that made life
beautiful and worthwhile.

57:03.310 --> 57:07.470
After the Fuhrer and National Socialism,
there's nothing left to live for.

57:08.510 --> 57:11.120
That's why I brought
the children too.

57:11.640 --> 57:13.720
They're too good for the life
that awaits them.

57:14.240 --> 57:18.920
God will have mercy on me
if I bring them redemption myself.

57:26.740 --> 57:30.900
I'll wear my bracelet with the green
stone until the very end.

57:31.420 --> 57:36.630
After that, I want
you to always wear it.

57:38.190 --> 57:41.840
Unfortunately, my diamond watch
is with the watchmaker.

57:42.370 --> 57:46.540
I included the address below.
I hope you're lucky enough to get it.

57:47.590 --> 57:49.150
I want you to get it.

57:50.720 --> 57:54.370
You'll also get the bracelet
with the topaz pendant.

57:54.890 --> 57:57.500
A birthday present
from the Fuhrer.

57:59.070 --> 58:02.720
I owe some money
to the Heise company.

58:03.770 --> 58:08.660
There may be more debts, but
no more than 1500 Reichsmarks.

58:10.220 --> 58:16.490
All correspondence with
the Fuhrer must be burnt.

58:18.570 --> 58:24.840
I'm sending you some food and tobacco.
The coffee is also for Lindner and Kathl.

58:25.360 --> 58:31.100
The cigarettes are for Mandi, the tobacco
for daddy, the chocolate for mummy.

58:31.840 --> 58:36.540
I can't think of anything else.
That's it for today.

58:37.550 --> 58:41.200
Dear sister, I wish
you lots of happiness.

58:41.640 --> 58:45.290
And remember,
you will see Hermann again.

58:45.810 --> 58:49.470
The warmest regards
and a kiss from...

58:49.990 --> 58:51.550
...your sister.

59:43.280 --> 59:45.360
Inge.

01:00:34.980 --> 01:00:40.200
Listen, Keitel.
I want you to leave this evening.

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:44.380
Go to Donitz and help him
with the organisation.

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:48.030
Things have to be
started up again.

01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:51.680
I don't understand you.

01:00:52.200 --> 01:00:55.860
We have no more oil fields.
That's catastrophic.

01:00:56.360 --> 01:01:02.100
It makes any serious operation
impossible.

01:01:02.120 --> 01:01:08.910
When everything has been solved
here, we must get the oil fields back.

01:01:13.600 --> 01:01:16.730
Any questions?
-No, mein Fuhrer.

01:01:17.260 --> 01:01:19.860
Good.
Have a good trip.

01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:49.640
Mein Fuhrer, since you have decided
to stay here in Berlin...

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:56.780
...do you agree that I take charge...

01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:00.430
...with complete freedom of action?

01:03:00.950 --> 01:03:03.040
If I receive no reply
by 2200 hours...

01:03:03.560 --> 01:03:06.590
...I'll assume you have
been incapacitated.

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.770
I will then act on behalf
of the country and the motherland.

01:03:11.810 --> 01:03:14.420
That's high treason.
And betrayal of you.

01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:17.550
Goring's concerns are not
entirely unjustified.

01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:21.210
If our communication
system fails...

01:03:21.730 --> 01:03:24.860
...we'll be cut off
from the outside world.

01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:27.470
We won't be able
to issue orders anymore.

01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:30.600
I think Goring wants to
seize the power.

01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:34.260
I never trusted his clique
on the Obersalzberg.

01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.870
This looks like a coup.

01:03:37.390 --> 01:03:41.040
The loser, the sponger.

01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:44.170
A parvenu, a lazy bastard.

01:03:45.320 --> 01:03:50.010
How dare he say
I'm incapacitated?

01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:54.190
Hello.
-How did you get into Berlin?

01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:57.320
It wasn't easy,
but I must speak to the Fuhrer.

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:00.450
If I were you,
I'd wait a bit.

01:04:00.970 --> 01:04:04.100
The Luftwaffe.
What did he turn that into?

01:04:04.630 --> 01:04:07.760
For that alone,
he should be executed.

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:14.010
This morphine addict
corrupted the country.

01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:16.610
And now this.

01:04:17.650 --> 01:04:20.250
He's betraying me.

01:04:21.810 --> 01:04:24.940
Me of all people.

01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:35.350
I want Goring stripped
of his power, right away.

01:04:36.390 --> 01:04:38.990
And, in case I don't
survive the war...

01:04:39.510 --> 01:04:42.640
...he must be
executed immediately.

01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:49.400
What's going to happen to us?
Is there any hope left?

01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:55.130
Frau Junge, leave from
here before it's too late.

01:04:55.650 --> 01:04:59.810
The Fuhrer wants to stay.
We can't leave him behind, can we?

01:04:59.820 --> 01:05:05.540
He doesn't need anybody for what
awaits him. And least of all you.

01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:10.750
But Herr Goebbels and his wife
stay here. And the children.

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:22.200
But the children...

01:05:25.840 --> 01:05:27.930
I have always believed...

01:05:29.490 --> 01:05:32.610
...that there was a way out.

01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:41.460
Come in.

01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:45.630
Albert. Hello.

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.160
You have a fever.

01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:02.800
Albert, I can't stand
it anymore.

01:06:04.890 --> 01:06:07.490
Why don't you leave with
the children, Magda?

01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:10.610
Leave?
And go where?

01:06:11.130 --> 01:06:15.820
I can arrange for you to be
taken to Schwanenwerder by barge.

01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:19.980
You can hide
until everything's over.

01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:22.590
It won't be long now anyway.

01:06:23.110 --> 01:06:25.190
I thought about it.

01:06:26.750 --> 01:06:31.960
My children cannot grow up
in a world without National Socialism.

01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:39.760
Think about it. The children
have a right to a future.

01:06:43.930 --> 01:06:48.620
If National Socialism dies,
there will be no future.

01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:07.640
I can't believe
you really want that.

01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:12.320
Go now.

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:45.260
Come in.

01:07:49.430 --> 01:07:51.510
I knew you'd come.

01:07:52.030 --> 01:07:55.150
You wouldn't desert
the Fuhrer.

01:07:59.180 --> 01:08:04.910
I've come to say goodbye to the Fuhrer.
I'm going back to Hamburg tonight.

01:08:05.430 --> 01:08:08.030
Of course, you must go.
Sit down.

01:08:10.640 --> 01:08:13.760
I took some furniture
you designed.

01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:16.310
I couldn't leave it behind.

01:08:16.830 --> 01:08:20.990
Please, you must
not have eaten all day.

01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.600
That's true.

01:08:28.279 --> 01:08:33.490
It's very important that you came.
It shows him you're on his side.

01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:36.090
Did he ever doubt that?

01:08:37.649 --> 01:08:41.300
Lately, he often thought
you were against him too.

01:08:41.819 --> 01:08:45.460
I always said you'd come
and here you are.

01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:53.790
I think he liked it that you
advised him to stay in Berlin.

01:08:54.310 --> 01:08:56.390
I also think it's best.

01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.600
And, you know...

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:04.720
...it may sound strange...

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:12.010
...but I'm really happy here.
And I'm not afraid.

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:43.450
You came.
-Mein Fuhrer, I...

01:09:43.450 --> 01:09:45.529
It's good.

01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:48.660
Let's sit down.

01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:11.840
I had great plans
for the Germans and the world.

01:10:13.400 --> 01:10:18.620
Nobody understood me.
Not even my old brothers in arms.

01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:29.060
The opportunities we had.
The whole world was ours to grab.

01:10:32.060 --> 01:10:33.630
Too late.

01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:45.110
I can only be proud for openly
fighting the Jews...

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:50.850
...and for cleansing the Lebensraum
from the Jewish poison.

01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:59.730
I don't find it hard to continue.
One brief moment...

01:10:59.730 --> 01:11:10.170
...and then eternal peace.

01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:17.470
But please spare the people,
mein Fuhrer.

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:23.220
If my people cannot endure
this ordeal...

01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:26.350
...I won't shed a tear.

01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:28.960
They get what they deserve.

01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:35.220
They called this fate
upon themselves.

01:11:40.450 --> 01:11:42.530
For months...

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:46.190
...I have to tell you this...

01:11:47.750 --> 01:11:51.410
...for months I have sabotaged
your orders for destruction.

01:11:53.500 --> 01:12:00.280
I not only ignored your orders,
but even acted against them.

01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:07.060
I had to tell you.

01:12:16.370 --> 01:12:20.550
This never compromised
my personal loyalty to you.

01:12:33.820 --> 01:12:36.430
So you're leaving.

01:12:37.680 --> 01:12:39.250
Good.

01:12:39.770 --> 01:12:41.330
Goodbye.

01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:55.040
I wish you all the best.

01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:20.730
Eat well, gentlemen.

01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:18.120
Peter.

01:14:27.190 --> 01:14:29.800
It's alright, son.

01:14:46.650 --> 01:14:48.210
He has a fever.

01:14:50.370 --> 01:14:51.410
Yes, but he's alive.

01:15:16.320 --> 01:15:20.490
Loyalty and courage
still exist in this world.

01:15:21.010 --> 01:15:24.140
Ritter von Greim
and Fraulein Reitsch, how good...

01:15:27.280 --> 01:15:31.450
...that the both of you arrived
more or less unharmed.

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:33.540
Sit down.

01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:38.240
We came under heavy fire, but
still arrived in Gatow.

01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:41.370
From there,
we couldn't continue.

01:15:42.420 --> 01:15:46.590
We flew in a Fieseler Storch,
over the Russian lines...

01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:50.250
...and landed on the
East-West axis, close to here.

01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:53.390
Before landing, the Soviets
had a go at us.

01:15:55.070 --> 01:15:59.780
General Von Greim, I appoint you
supreme commander of the Luftwaffe.

01:16:00.820 --> 01:16:03.440
I hereby promote you
to General-Feldmarschall.

01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:07.170
A big responsibility
rests on your shoulders.

01:16:07.690 --> 01:16:10.830
You have to rebuild the
Luftwaffe from scratch.

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.970
Many mistakes have been made.
Be ruthless.

01:16:15.540 --> 01:16:18.680
Life doesn't forgive weakness.

01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:26.540
This so-called humanity
is religious drivel.

01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:33.340
Compassion is an eternal sin.
To feel compassion for the weak...

01:16:33.870 --> 01:16:35.440
...is a betrayal of nature.

01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:41.720
The strong can only triumph
if the weak are exterminated.

01:16:42.240 --> 01:16:46.030
Being loyal to this law,
I've never had compassion.

01:16:50.050 --> 01:16:54.240
I've always been ruthless
when faced with internal...

01:16:54.770 --> 01:16:58.950
...opposition from other races.
And that's the only way.

01:17:01.050 --> 01:17:03.140
Apes, for instance...

01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:08.850
...kill all the odd ones.

01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:15.130
And what applies to apes,
must definitely apply to humans.

01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:23.530
Himmler made an offer to surrender...

01:17:23.530 --> 01:17:29.290
...to the allied powers.

01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:31.380
Via Count Bernadotte.

01:17:33.470 --> 01:17:36.090
A message from the English radio.

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:46.040
Himmler.
Himmler of all people.

01:17:47.090 --> 01:17:54.420
The most loyal of my loyals.
That's the worst betrayal.

01:17:58.080 --> 01:17:59.270
Goring, he was corrupt.
Always has been.

01:18:02.250 --> 01:18:08.490
Speer, an absent-minded artist.
All the others: yes.

01:18:09.010 --> 01:18:15.260
But Himmler?
Has he gone insane?

01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:19.940
He must have told
them I'm sick.

01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:22.550
Maybe even dead.

01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:33.480
Leave me alone with Ritter Von Greim
and Fraulein Reitsch.

01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:39.730
And get Fegelein.
-We don't know where he is.

01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:43.890
What? He's Himmler's assistant.
He must be available.

01:18:43.890 --> 01:18:48.580
We haven't seen him for days.
-I want a report immediately.

01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:53.260
Please stay here, Doctor.

01:18:58.470 --> 01:19:02.630
You and Greim must go as quickly
as possible. Fly to Donitz.

01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:08.880
Tell him to do anything
it takes to punish Himmler.

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:13.560
We've decided to
die with you.

01:19:16.170 --> 01:19:18.770
Thank you for this proof of loyalty.

01:19:20.330 --> 01:19:23.970
But Himmler must die.
He committed treason.

01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:28.660
He's no longer privvy
to my plans.

01:19:29.180 --> 01:19:30.220
Mein Fuhrer?

01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:34.390
Do you think I'll sit and wait until
those Jewish swine slaughter me?

01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:39.070
This is part of a huge decoy operation.
I've allowed the enemy...

01:19:39.070 --> 01:19:44.280
...to invade the Reich and they
think they've won.

01:19:44.800 --> 01:19:48.440
But mark my words: they have
another thing coming.

01:19:48.440 --> 01:19:52.610
Donitz is mobilising in the north.
Kesselring in the south.

01:19:53.130 --> 01:19:57.290
We'll surround the enemy
and crush them.

01:19:57.810 --> 01:20:03.020
From Prague, three armies will attack
the Russians, simultaneously, from the back.

01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:08.740
I didn't know we still had
so many reserve troops.

01:20:09.790 --> 01:20:13.430
I made sure you'll soon have
a 1000 of the most modern...

01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:17.590
...jets at your disposal.

01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:22.280
With those, you can make the
Luftwaffe ready for battle again.

01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:27.490
I kneel to your genius, at the
altar of the motherland.

01:20:42.370 --> 01:20:43.930
Heil, mein Fuhrer.

01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:50.180
You also request to leave Berlin?

01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:55.910
Mein Fuhrer, as you know,
all medical departments...

01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:59.550
...that fall under the SS and Himmler,
have left Berlin.

01:21:00.590 --> 01:21:04.760
Himmler is a traitor.
He won't escape punishment.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:10.120
Mein Fuhrer, as Reichsarzt SS,
I have no more work here.

01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:14.800
Your request to leave Berlin
is unacceptable.

01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:18.450
My family...

01:21:20.010 --> 01:21:23.130
If the Russians...
I must leave.

01:21:23.650 --> 01:21:25.210
You did nothing wrong.

01:21:26.250 --> 01:21:31.460
Future generations will thank you
for you medical research.

01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:34.060
I take all the responsibility.

01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:42.910
We'll talk about it later.

01:21:57.250 --> 01:22:01.420
GruppenFuhrer Fegelein cannot
be found. He's not in the bunker.

01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:04.540
What, you can't find Fegelein?

01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:09.750
Keep searching.
I need to talk to him. Immediately.

01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:14.950
If he left just like that,
that's desertion. Treason.

01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:17.030
Bring me Fegelein.

01:22:17.550 --> 01:22:20.160
Fegelein. Fegelein.

01:22:31.650 --> 01:22:34.770
Daddy, why are you wearing
your Sunday uniform?

01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:42.580
Ernst, is something wrong?
-No.

01:22:43.100 --> 01:22:44.660
Thank you.

01:22:45.190 --> 01:22:46.750
Brigitte is hungry too.

01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:52.470
Ilse, you should
eat something as well.

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:56.640
Thank you.
-There you go.

01:23:01.320 --> 01:23:02.880
Thank you.

01:23:56.900 --> 01:24:00.540
What is it?
-GruppenFuhrer, you're under arrest.

01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:03.150
What?
-You're suspected of desertion.

01:24:03.670 --> 01:24:05.750
Get dressed.
You'll come with us.

01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:12.520
Search the room.

01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:16.160
Let go of me.
You can't give me orders.

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:21.370
You can't have Hermann
executed, can you?

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:25.010
There's no doubt.
He wanted to flee.

01:24:25.010 --> 01:24:28.650
What does it matter?
Everything's over.

01:24:29.700 --> 01:24:32.300
Think of my poor sister.
She's pregnant by Hermann.

01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:35.940
He collaborated with Himmler.
He's a traitor.

01:24:39.070 --> 01:24:44.270
There's no mercy for traitors.
No compassion for them.

01:24:46.360 --> 01:24:49.480
He'll be court-martialled
and executed.

01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:52.600
What's the point of that?

01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:56.250
It is my wish.

01:25:10.140 --> 01:25:11.180
You're the Fuhrer.

01:25:15.020 --> 01:25:16.060
Speak.

01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:19.180
The Russians are advancing
more and more.

01:25:19.710 --> 01:25:22.830
There are no more reserves.
Supplies from the air are impossible.

01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:25.950
There is no ammunition coming
in anymore.

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:32.720
In the north, the Russians are standing
in front of the Weidendammer bridge.

01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:36.360
In the east: Lustgarten.
South: Potsdammer Platz.

01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:40.530
West: Tiergarten, about 400 metres
away from the chancellery.

01:25:41.570 --> 01:25:44.690
How long can you hold out?
-At most, two days.

01:25:45.730 --> 01:25:48.340
Including the government area?
-Yes.

01:25:49.380 --> 01:25:54.580
As a soldier, I suggest we
flee Berlin. It's surrounded.

01:25:55.110 --> 01:26:01.370
The battle of Berlin killed about
20,000 of our best officers.

01:26:01.370 --> 01:26:05.020
That's what young people are for.

01:26:06.070 --> 01:26:09.200
What you suggest is insane.
Ridiculous.

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:12.850
Think of the thousands of wounded.
We can't help them.

01:26:12.850 --> 01:26:17.550
Mein Fuhrer, the orders have been written.
I give you my word...

01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:22.770
The Fuhrer cannot make a honourless
disappearance from world history.

01:26:23.290 --> 01:26:27.470
Even if an advance is successful...

01:26:27.990 --> 01:26:31.120
...I'll end up in another
troublesome situation.

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:36.860
I'd have to stay in the open air
or on a farm...

01:26:37.390 --> 01:26:38.950
...and wait for the end.

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:46.260
Wenck is advancing with the 12th army.
He can join the 9th...

01:26:46.600 --> 01:26:50.780
...and give the Russians
the final blow.

01:26:51.480 --> 01:26:55.660
Wenck's an excellent fellow.
Send a telegram to Keitel:

01:26:58.790 --> 01:27:04.530
Immediately report to me the following:
1. Where are Wenck's vanguard located?

01:27:05.570 --> 01:27:08.180
2. When will they attack again?

01:27:09.230 --> 01:27:14.970
3. Where is the 9th army?
4. Where will the 9th make a breakthrough?

01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:21.750
You'll see, gentlemen.
I'll be right.

01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:24.890
Wenck will come.

01:27:31.380 --> 01:27:33.460
Wenck will come.

01:27:46.710 --> 01:27:50.890
I want to know if Wenck
can do anything at all.

01:27:51.410 --> 01:27:56.110
It's unlikely that Wenck's
small amount of troops...

01:27:56.630 --> 01:28:01.330
What's unlikely about the offensive?
-Wenck can't do anything anymore.

01:28:01.850 --> 01:28:06.030
Then why don't you tell the Fuhrer that?
Has everybody gone mad?

01:28:06.550 --> 01:28:09.680
Do you think the Fuhrer doesn't know?
He'll never surrender.

01:28:10.200 --> 01:28:13.860
And neither will we. I've been
through that once. Never again.

01:28:14.380 --> 01:28:16.470
Come along. I have to go.

01:28:26.620 --> 01:28:28.190
Stop right there.

01:28:40.270 --> 01:28:41.830
Heil Hitler.

01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:33.230
Excuse me. I fell asleep.

01:29:33.750 --> 01:29:35.840
Did you get some rest, my child?

01:29:39.330 --> 01:29:41.410
In shorthand.

01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:51.330
My political will.

01:29:52.390 --> 01:29:57.600
More than 30 years have passed...

01:29:57.610 --> 01:30:02.300
...since I made my contribution
as a volunteer...

01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:06.480
...during the first World War.

01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:12.220
During those 30 years,
I learnt to think, act and live...

01:30:12.740 --> 01:30:15.870
...out of love and loyalty
for my people.

01:30:19.810 --> 01:30:23.450
Excuse me. The shooting.
-Please sit down.

01:30:27.170 --> 01:30:29.780
Centuries will pass...

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:34.460
...but from the ruins
of our cities and monuments...

01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:40.190
...the hatred
of the people...

01:30:40.190 --> 01:30:43.310
...who did this to us,
will continue to flare up.

01:30:43.830 --> 01:30:48.000
International Judaism and
its allies.

01:30:59.180 --> 01:31:01.260
What is it, Herr Minister?

01:31:04.910 --> 01:31:07.510
Imagine this.
The Fuhrer wants me to leave Berlin.

01:31:08.550 --> 01:31:10.630
He ordered it.

01:31:12.720 --> 01:31:16.360
I've never ignored an order
from the Fuhrer.

01:31:25.050 --> 01:31:30.770
But I will ignore this order.
I'll stay with the Fuhrer.

01:31:34.490 --> 01:31:36.570
Please, Frau Junge...

01:31:38.650 --> 01:31:41.780
...I want to dictate my will to you.

01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:46.980
I'm typing
the Fuhrer's will.

01:31:48.020 --> 01:31:50.100
Good.

01:31:51.150 --> 01:31:53.750
I understand.
Some other time.

01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:06.150
Mein Fuhrer, according to the racial law
I'm obliged to ask you:

01:32:06.680 --> 01:32:09.280
Mein Fuhrer, are you
of Aryan descent?

01:32:14.210 --> 01:32:16.820
Can I see your identity card?

01:32:17.900 --> 01:32:21.030
You're talking to the Fuhrer here.
-Alright then.

01:32:21.550 --> 01:32:25.190
And you, Fraulein Braun,
are you of Aryan descent?

01:32:26.020 --> 01:32:29.150
Then there's nothing
to stop us.

01:32:29.670 --> 01:32:33.310
I'm asking you now:
Do you, mein Fuhrer, Adolf Hitler...

01:32:33.830 --> 01:32:39.040
...take Eva Braun, present here,
as your wife? Answer 'yes'.

01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:44.760
Do you, Eva Braun, take Fuhrer
Adolf Hitler, present here...

01:32:45.280 --> 01:32:48.410
...as your husband?
Answer 'yes'.

01:32:49.970 --> 01:32:53.090
Then I declare you
man and wife.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:34.480
Two men here.

01:33:36.750 --> 01:33:38.310
Everything will be alright.

01:33:40.230 --> 01:33:42.830
You must go to the Fuhrer right away.
-Now?

01:34:02.500 --> 01:34:06.670
How long can we hold out?
-Twenty hours, no more.

01:34:08.230 --> 01:34:13.960
The Russians are close. At the moment,
we forced them to stop.

01:34:14.480 --> 01:34:19.680
You know, Mohnke. The western
democracies are decadent.

01:34:20.200 --> 01:34:25.410
They'll succumb to
the people from the east.

01:34:28.530 --> 01:34:31.130
All the best. Thank you.

01:34:32.180 --> 01:34:35.300
It wasn't just for Germany.

01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:57.280
A message from Keitel.

01:35:00.410 --> 01:35:03.720
1. Wenck's vanguard are
stuck south of Schwielowsee.

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:07.880
2. The 12th army can't continue
the attack on Berlin.

01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:12.570
3. The 9th army is
completely surrounded.

01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:37.720
What do we do when the last
ammunition reserves have been exhausted?

01:35:38.760 --> 01:35:41.880
I'll never surrender. Never.

01:35:43.960 --> 01:35:49.180
I forbid you, and the other
commanders, to surrender.

01:36:01.180 --> 01:36:06.920
Listen, Gunsche. My wife and I
are going to commit suicide.

01:36:07.440 --> 01:36:11.610
I don't want my corpse
exposed by the Russians.

01:36:12.130 --> 01:36:15.260
I don't want them to get me,
dead or alive.

01:36:15.780 --> 01:36:19.430
I want to be burnt
and never to be found.

01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:26.720
Gunsche, I want you to promise me...

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:32.450
...that you will do
all that it takes.

01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:35.060
Mein Fuhrer...

01:36:35.060 --> 01:36:39.230
...this is a terrible order,
but I will execute it.

01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:09.630
Kempka.
-Erich, I need 200 litres of petrol.

01:37:09.630 --> 01:37:13.270
Are you mad?
Where should I find them?

01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:15.880
From the parked vehicles.

01:37:16.920 --> 01:37:19.530
What's all that petrol for?
-I can't say.

01:37:36.210 --> 01:37:39.340
Come, please.
The Fuhrer wants to see us.

01:37:48.790 --> 01:37:51.400
Should I tell the Fuhrer
you're indisposed?

01:37:52.440 --> 01:37:55.570
It's only my collapsed lung.

01:37:57.610 --> 01:37:59.690
I'll die soon anyway.

01:38:45.190 --> 01:38:47.270
Excuse me.

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.930
Over here, Herr Professor.

01:39:10.930 --> 01:39:13.530
One moment, please.

01:39:22.770 --> 01:39:24.330
Excuse me.

01:39:57.760 --> 01:40:01.930
I'm sorry to interrupt
your important work.

01:40:02.450 --> 01:40:06.620
Mein Fuhrer, keep faith
in the final victory.

01:40:07.140 --> 01:40:11.830
Lead us
and we shall follow.

01:40:15.620 --> 01:40:17.190
Come along.

01:40:24.450 --> 01:40:26.540
Join the gang.

01:40:28.770 --> 01:40:31.380
Come. Have a drink.

01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:36.070
Besides drinking, there's little we can do.
-Do sit down.

01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:43.370
That's better.
Yes, the situation is pretty shitty.

01:40:47.540 --> 01:40:51.180
Can we sit down?
-Please do, Fraulein...

01:40:51.710 --> 01:40:55.880
Frau...
-That's Frau Hitler.

01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:00.040
It's alright.

01:41:02.130 --> 01:41:04.730
A pity we can't go
outside anymore.

01:41:05.260 --> 01:41:08.380
Only if you want
to die a heroic death.

01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:14.640
Fritz, control yourself a bit.
-Yes. Control.

01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:17.240
Take cover.

01:41:38.710 --> 01:41:42.360
What are you doing here?
-I have to report to the Fuhrer.

01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:44.970
You can't right now.
Sit down.

01:41:45.490 --> 01:41:47.570
Sit. Drink.

01:41:51.740 --> 01:41:53.830
Let me introduce Frau Hitler.

01:41:53.830 --> 01:41:58.000
So young and so many decorations.
You must be proud.

01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:03.730
Excuse me.
I'm not used to drinking anymore.

01:42:04.770 --> 01:42:07.380
You can use our toilet.

01:42:15.170 --> 01:42:20.380
If your hand shakes, the bullet
might only hit an optic nerve.

01:42:20.900 --> 01:42:25.590
That's why it's good
to also take the poison.

01:42:26.120 --> 01:42:30.810
When you bite through the capsule,
pull the trigger.

01:42:31.330 --> 01:42:33.410
Will I have enough time?

01:42:34.450 --> 01:42:37.060
The poison starts working
after one or two seconds.

01:42:54.470 --> 01:42:57.080
Tornow, you too.

01:43:06.110 --> 01:43:07.680
Come Blondi.

01:43:39.340 --> 01:43:41.940
You know, Frau Junge,
I've known...

01:43:42.990 --> 01:43:45.590
my husband for
more than 15 years.

01:43:46.110 --> 01:43:50.800
But when I think about it,
I know nothing about him.

01:43:51.330 --> 01:43:53.410
Even though he likes to talk.

01:43:56.540 --> 01:44:01.230
I longed for Berlin,
but he's so different now.

01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:05.400
He only talks about dogs
and vegetarian food now.

01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:08.520
I hate Blondi.

01:44:10.090 --> 01:44:15.300
I sometimes kick her and Adolf
then wonders why she acts strange.

01:44:26.250 --> 01:44:28.850
I think he doesn't want anybody
to really know him.

01:44:31.980 --> 01:44:36.670
...he can be so caring
in his private life.

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:42.930
And then he uses
that rude language again.

01:44:43.980 --> 01:44:46.060
When he's the Fuhrer, you mean?

01:44:47.630 --> 01:44:50.760
Come, let's smoke another one.

01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:14.120
I'm sorry.

01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:20.370
You have so many worries
and here I am, whining.

01:45:21.410 --> 01:45:25.060
Frau Junge, I'm giving you this coat
as a goodbye present.

01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:30.800
I like fashionable ladies.
I want you to enjoy it.

01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:34.450
What a surprise. Thank you.

01:45:36.010 --> 01:45:39.660
I just don't know where and when
I can wear it.

01:45:41.230 --> 01:45:44.360
Please, try to get out of here.

01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:47.490
Promise me.

01:47:16.950 --> 01:47:21.760
Thank you. That was very good,
Fraulein Manziarly.

01:47:42.770 --> 01:47:46.940
The time has come. It's finished.

01:48:25.780 --> 01:48:27.860
The Fuhrer wants to say goodbye.
Come with me.

01:48:59.850 --> 01:49:02.980
You're the bravest mother
of the Reich.

01:49:03.510 --> 01:49:07.680
Fuhrer, you made me the happiest
woman in Germany.

01:49:31.820 --> 01:49:33.910
Salute my beautiful Bavaria.

01:49:57.530 --> 01:49:59.610
Children, what are you doing here?

01:50:00.140 --> 01:50:02.740
We want to see aunt Eva
and uncle Hitler.

01:50:03.270 --> 01:50:06.920
Have you eaten anything yet?
-Only breakfast.

01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:12.130
Stay here, I'll get something to eat.
I'll be right back.

01:50:21.330 --> 01:50:26.020
Comrades, this is the
latest news from the outside.

01:50:26.540 --> 01:50:31.760
Berlin is full of warehouses: There were
houses here, there were houses there.

01:50:37.290 --> 01:50:39.370
Herr Gunsche,
I want to speak to the Fuhrer.

01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:43.020
Please, I have to.

01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:46.150
Frau Goebbels, the Fuhrer
doesn't want to be disturbed.

01:50:46.160 --> 01:50:49.280
Please, Gunsche,
just for a moment.

01:50:49.810 --> 01:50:51.370
Please.

01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:01.450
Mein Fuhrer, Frau Goebbels is here.

01:51:07.930 --> 01:51:09.490
What is it?

01:51:10.010 --> 01:51:13.660
Mein Fuhrer, I beg you:
Leave Berlin.

01:51:14.710 --> 01:51:20.450
Don't leave us Fuhrer.
What will become of us?

01:51:24.330 --> 01:51:31.630
Tomorrow, I'll be cursed by millions,
but that's how it is.

01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:36.520
Get up. Come.

01:51:39.130 --> 01:51:41.220
Come.

01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:52.160
Aunt Traudl, I like it
when it thunders.

01:51:52.690 --> 01:51:56.340
Why?
-Nothing can happen to us here.

01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:58.950
Can it?
-No.

01:52:08.460 --> 01:52:10.020
Gotcha.

01:52:33.050 --> 01:52:36.700
Reichsleiter, it's over.

01:52:55.580 --> 01:52:58.190
The Fuhrer is dead.

01:53:13.950 --> 01:53:16.040
There's daddy.

01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:31.160
Are you crazy?
For that damned petrol of yours...

01:53:31.680 --> 01:53:33.770
Erich, shut up.

01:53:44.220 --> 01:53:45.790
Stand back.

01:53:59.250 --> 01:54:00.820
Come on, continue.

01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:02.900
Continue.

01:55:32.430 --> 01:55:35.560
No, don't.

01:55:36.840 --> 01:55:38.930
Let grandpa go.

01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:48.930
Order. Order.
We must have order.

01:55:49.980 --> 01:55:52.580
Order has to return.

01:56:06.910 --> 01:56:11.090
This way. We know the way.
You can trust us.

01:56:12.130 --> 01:56:13.700
Hurry.

01:56:20.210 --> 01:56:22.820
I was on the side of
the Red Beasts.

01:56:26.860 --> 01:56:28.940
I supported the Bolsheviks.

01:56:36.440 --> 01:56:38.000
Let's hope the Russians
got our message.

01:56:38.530 --> 01:56:41.130
We'll soon find out.
-Or not.

01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:49.490
What news do you have, General?

01:56:50.010 --> 01:56:55.220
Adolf Hitler and his wife
committed suicide in the bunker.

01:56:58.360 --> 01:57:02.530
The new government
authorised me...

01:57:04.620 --> 01:57:07.750
...to start peace talks...

01:57:08.270 --> 01:57:14.530
...between our countries, that both
suffered severe losses.

01:57:15.570 --> 01:57:20.270
General, if you were me,
would you make peace with you?

01:57:20.790 --> 01:57:24.960
My government will never accept
unconditional surrender.

01:57:27.570 --> 01:57:31.740
Given the situation,
you have no other choice.

01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:37.480
Surrender? Never.
That's shameful.

01:57:38.530 --> 01:57:40.610
Years ago, I conquered
Berlin on the Reds...

01:57:41.130 --> 01:57:45.290
...and I'll defend the city
to my dying day.

01:57:46.330 --> 01:57:48.940
In the short time I have
as Chancellor...

01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:53.620
...I'll never sign
a surrender treaty.

01:57:54.140 --> 01:57:57.270
It's for the sake of the people.
-The Fuhrer's orders are final.

01:57:57.790 --> 01:58:01.430
This is crazy.
We have to start negotiations.

01:58:01.950 --> 01:58:05.070
I repeat, gentlemen:
I do not surrender.

01:58:06.120 --> 01:58:08.720
Send a message to Marshal Zhukov.
-Zhukov?

01:58:09.240 --> 01:58:11.840
What's happening?
-We're surrendering.

01:58:12.360 --> 01:58:15.490
Then I must kill you.
The Fuhrer forbids any surrender.

01:58:35.570 --> 01:58:38.690
How long does it work?
-Around four hours.

01:59:15.800 --> 01:59:21.000
Children, the doctor has the medication
I told you about.

01:59:21.520 --> 01:59:24.130
It's a bit bitter,
but it will work.

01:59:25.690 --> 01:59:27.250
A sip for everybody.

01:59:28.810 --> 01:59:30.890
Who wants to go first?

01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:37.140
Heide, you're always so brave?

01:59:42.870 --> 01:59:44.430
Have another sip.

01:59:47.550 --> 01:59:49.630
See? That wasn't so bad.

01:59:54.780 --> 01:59:56.860
Well done.
Helmut.

01:59:59.980 --> 02:00:04.670
This medication makes sure you don't
get ill in this humid bunker.

02:00:05.190 --> 02:00:07.790
But it's not humid
in the bunker.

02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:14.040
Well done.

02:00:23.290 --> 02:00:24.850
Helga.

02:00:27.580 --> 02:00:28.620
I don't want to.

02:00:29.150 --> 02:00:33.780
What's that? Do you want to get sick?
-Please, mama. I don't want to drink it.

02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:41.600
Don't cry, baby.
That doesn't help.

02:00:42.120 --> 02:00:44.210
You have to drink the medicine.

02:00:47.860 --> 02:00:49.430
Helga.

02:00:55.160 --> 02:00:57.770
Come on, open your mouth.

02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:20.670
Goodnight, children.

02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:34.570
One day the lie will fall apart...

02:01:34.570 --> 02:01:37.700
...and there will be light
in the darkness.

02:01:38.740 --> 02:01:40.300
Please read that.

02:01:41.350 --> 02:01:46.040
One day the lie will fall apart
and there will be light in the darkness.

02:01:47.610 --> 02:01:50.740
Let's do it differently.
One day the lie will collapse...

02:01:51.260 --> 02:01:55.950
...and truth will triumph
once again.

02:01:56.470 --> 02:02:00.130
At that moment, we will
stand above everybody...

02:02:00.650 --> 02:02:02.730
...pure and...

02:02:05.860 --> 02:02:07.950
immaculate.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:18.130
We don't stand a chance.
-So what? I want to get away.

02:06:18.650 --> 02:06:20.220
How do we get
through the lines?

02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:23.350
Doesn't matter.
I'm not staying another minute.

02:06:23.870 --> 02:06:27.000
We'll die.
-It won't be that bad, surely.

02:06:28.040 --> 02:06:30.650
If we stay, the Russians
will get us for sure.

02:06:32.730 --> 02:06:33.780
All the best.

02:06:34.300 --> 02:06:36.390
Come, let's go.

02:08:05.250 --> 02:08:11.990
On 30 April 1945, the Fuhrer
committed suicide...

02:08:11.990 --> 02:08:17.720
...and in doing so, he deserted
everybody who was loyal to him.

02:08:18.250 --> 02:08:23.460
You, German soldiers, were loyal to
the Fuhrer and were prepared...

02:08:23.980 --> 02:08:30.240
...to continue the battle for Berlin,
although ammunition was in short supply...

02:08:30.760 --> 02:08:35.460
...and further resistance
was pointless.

02:08:35.980 --> 02:08:39.630
I hereby declare an
immediate cease-fire.

02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:43.800
Each hour you continue fighting...

02:08:44.330 --> 02:08:51.110
...prolongs the suffering of the people
of Berlin and of our wounded.

02:08:51.630 --> 02:08:55.280
In agreement with the supreme
command of the Soviet troops...

02:08:55.800 --> 02:09:01.540
...I order you to stop
fighting immediately.

02:09:02.060 --> 02:09:09.360
Weidling, former commander
of the Berlin defence area.

02:09:10.930 --> 02:09:13.010
A glass of water, please.

02:10:18.750 --> 02:10:21.360
I don't need you anymore.

02:10:24.490 --> 02:10:27.100
The game's over.

02:11:34.810 --> 02:11:37.420
It's time.
-Don't you see what's going on here?

02:11:37.940 --> 02:11:41.060
I insist that you help us,
as a doctor.

02:11:42.110 --> 02:11:44.190
Alright, then.

02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:56.170
Go. You did a lot.
Thank you.

02:12:02.920 --> 02:12:09.010
Schadle, hurry. Come on.
-I'm not going anywhere anymore.

02:12:11.610 --> 02:12:13.180
Come along.

02:12:51.780 --> 02:12:54.380
Are you alright?
-Keep going.

02:13:31.180 --> 02:13:34.830
Sturmmann Kruger and his group
defended the Wolf Bridge...

02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:37.950
...and he receives the Iron Cross.

02:13:38.470 --> 02:13:42.640
Sturmmann Wagner took out two
machine-gun nests...

02:13:43.160 --> 02:13:46.290
...and therefore, receives
the Iron Cross.

02:13:46.810 --> 02:13:50.460
Sturmmann Rauch has gotten
messages through the lines...

02:13:50.980 --> 02:13:53.580
...and receives the Iron Cross.

02:14:24.750 --> 02:14:26.830
The others are coming.

02:14:33.470 --> 02:14:35.550
Take cover, Muller.

02:14:55.180 --> 02:14:56.220
Who's that?

02:15:03.880 --> 02:15:05.960
A German.

02:15:11.580 --> 02:15:13.140
Herr Hewel?

02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:18.870
Thank God, you're alive.

02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:22.520
Where are the others?

02:15:25.130 --> 02:15:29.290
I don't know, Frau Junge.
Somewhere. Maybe.

02:15:29.820 --> 02:15:32.940
Most people from my group
must be dead.

02:15:33.460 --> 02:15:36.070
I should never
have left that bunker.

02:15:36.590 --> 02:15:41.280
I should have shot myself,
but I couldn't.

02:15:43.360 --> 02:15:46.490
Eat something first.
There's always enough time to die.

02:16:43.799 --> 02:16:46.410
You stay with the women.

02:16:47.540 --> 02:16:49.100
Come along.

02:17:01.629 --> 02:17:05.280
The Russians have surrounded us.
-What's going to happen to us?

02:17:05.799 --> 02:17:08.400
Maybe you can get through.
You could try.

02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:10.490
I'm not taking another step.

02:17:11.530 --> 02:17:16.219
Think about it. The Russians
are after us.

02:17:16.740 --> 02:17:21.950
As a woman, you might have a chance.
Try it.

02:17:22.990 --> 02:17:24.549
Good luck.

02:17:27.160 --> 02:17:31.330
When you walk past the Russians,
don't look them in the eyes.

02:17:31.850 --> 02:17:35.500
Remember that well. All the best.

02:17:44.520 --> 02:17:46.080
The Russians.

02:17:58.660 --> 02:18:01.270
Gerda, let's go.
-You go.

02:18:01.790 --> 02:18:04.920
I'm exhausted.
-Please.

02:18:07.010 --> 02:18:11.180
I have to give it a try.
Don't be angry with me.

02:18:15.360 --> 02:18:16.920
I'll be alright.

02:18:30.049 --> 02:18:31.620
Herr Doktor.

02:18:32.139 --> 02:18:36.840
My comrades want to surrender.
Can I join you?

02:18:37.360 --> 02:18:41.010
The Fuhrer's dead. Do you want
to continue the war on your own?

02:18:41.530 --> 02:18:43.100
I'm obliged by my oath.

02:18:43.620 --> 02:18:48.320
Then you'd better go
to the brigade-fuhrer.

02:19:16.990 --> 02:19:18.549
The Russians are evacuating the square.
-So?

02:19:19.600 --> 02:19:21.690
No opposition.
No shooting.

02:19:22.209 --> 02:19:24.820
Then they'll be
here within the hour.

02:19:25.340 --> 02:19:27.430
What shall we do?

02:19:27.430 --> 02:19:32.120
We can't surrender.
-What exactly do you mean?

02:19:32.650 --> 02:19:36.299
When the Russians come,
we'll empty our weapons on them.

02:19:36.820 --> 02:19:40.469
The last bullets are for ourselves.
-That's radical.

02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:45.690
Is this prestigious murder and suicide
our only option?

02:19:46.219 --> 02:19:49.870
We're SS officers.
We can't survive the Fuhrer.

02:19:49.870 --> 02:19:53.000
Who agrees with me?

02:21:40.670 --> 02:21:43.800
Come and sit down with me?
-Please.

02:21:49.630 --> 02:21:54.850
Why do you want to continue living?
-And you? Why do you want to die?

02:21:56.420 --> 02:21:58.540
See this?

02:21:59.070 --> 02:22:02.260
The Fuhrer gave it
to me personally.

02:22:02.790 --> 02:22:06.510
As a last decoration?
-Maybe.

02:22:07.050 --> 02:22:11.830
A goodbye present from Hitler.
I had to promise him something.

02:22:11.830 --> 02:22:17.140
If the Russians get me,
I have to kill myself.

02:22:19.270 --> 02:22:23.520
Did he make you promise that?
But why?

02:22:24.050 --> 02:22:27.240
Maybe he didn't want
me to be forced...

02:22:27.770 --> 02:22:29.900
...to say anything bad
about him.

02:22:30.430 --> 02:22:34.680
But, as a diplomat,
you're under international protection.

02:22:35.210 --> 02:22:38.930
Who will benefit
if you stick to your deal?

02:22:39.460 --> 02:22:41.060
There they are.

02:22:54.470 --> 02:22:56.060
Don't shoot, comrades.

02:23:00.060 --> 02:23:04.850
We surrendered.
The war is over.

02:23:05.910 --> 02:23:08.030
It's over.

02:24:43.580 --> 02:24:46.760

on 7 May 1945.

than 50 million people.

6 million Jews were killed
in German concentration camps.

02:25:05.900 --> 02:25:10.680

and avoid imprisonment.

02:25:57.980 --> 02:26:02.760
Hanna Reitsch survived the war
and would break many flying records.

02:26:03.290 --> 02:26:05.950
She died on 28 August 1979.

02:26:06.480 --> 02:26:11.800

suicide on 24 May 1945.

02:26:12.330 --> 02:26:14.990

He was sentenced to
20 years, in Nuremberg.

02:26:36.240 --> 02:26:38.900

Keitel and Jodl were sentenced to

02:26:47.400 --> 02:26:49.530

...on 2 May 1945,
near the Lehrter Bahnhof.

02:27:12.910 --> 02:27:17.170
Rochus Misch was released
by the Soviets in 1955.

02:27:17.700 --> 02:27:19.820
He still lives in Berlin.

02:27:20.350 --> 02:27:23.010
Traudl Junge was classified
as a 'young follower'.

02:27:23.540 --> 02:27:26.730
She worked as a secretary and lived
in Munich, until her death in 2002.

02:27:27.260 --> 02:27:32.580
All the horror I heard about during
the Nuremberg trial...

02:27:32.580 --> 02:27:39.490
...the 6 million Jews, dissidents
or people of another race...

02:27:40.020 --> 02:27:45.860
...who died, shocked me deeply.

02:27:46.930 --> 02:27:51.710
But I hadn't made the connection
with my own past yet.

02:27:52.770 --> 02:27:57.560
I reassured myself by thinking
I wasn't personally guilty of it.

02:27:58.090 --> 02:28:03.400
And that I hadn't known
about the sheer size of it.

02:28:03.930 --> 02:28:10.310
But one day, I walked
past a commemorative plaque...

02:28:10.840 --> 02:28:14.560
...for Sophie Scholl,
here in the Franz-Joseph-Strasse.

02:28:15.630 --> 02:28:18.280
I saw that she was my age...

02:28:18.810 --> 02:28:24.660
...and that she was executed in
the year I joined Hitler.

02:28:25.190 --> 02:28:30.510
And only then did I realise...

02:28:31.570 --> 02:28:34.230
that youth is no excuse.

02:28:34.760 --> 02:28:41.140
And that it might have been
possible to find out the truth.

02:31:20.200 --> 02:31:23.390
DOWNFALL
