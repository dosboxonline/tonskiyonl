03:42.755 --> 03:44.052
You fixed it yet?

03:44.724 --> 03:46.419
Just a couple more minutes.

03:47.794 --> 03:49.227
You said that an hour ago.

03:49.295 --> 03:50.455
I promised
to make you dinner, right?

03:50.530 --> 03:51.554
Yeah.

03:51.631 --> 03:53.599
Well, I'm making you
a gourmet dinner.

03:53.866 --> 03:55.925
Trust me.
It'll be worth the wait.

04:01.808 --> 04:03.002
Surrender.

04:03.676 --> 04:04.938
Hmm?

04:05.011 --> 04:07.605
Surrender to the wonders
of takeout.

04:07.680 --> 04:08.738
Oh.

04:09.482 --> 04:10.814
I knew this was coming.

04:11.818 --> 04:14.787
'Cause when your fingers dial
those seven little numbers,

04:14.854 --> 04:16.219
it really turns me on.

04:17.357 --> 04:19.450
Is that the best
you can come up with?

04:19.524 --> 04:20.651
Yeah.

04:23.329 --> 04:25.388
Wow. You are fast.

04:41.481 --> 04:42.573
Who was it?

04:44.350 --> 04:45.510
I don't know.

04:50.456 --> 04:52.424
It doesn't even say
where it's from.

04:52.492 --> 04:54.722
Well, there's
one way to find out.

05:08.741 --> 05:11.835
Oh, Jamie,
you adopted us a baby.

05:12.011 --> 05:14.377
A baby?
Have you seen this thing?

05:14.714 --> 05:15.840
Well, who would send you
a doll?

05:15.915 --> 05:17.940
I have no idea.

05:19.385 --> 05:21.285
There's no card, no note.

05:21.454 --> 05:23.388
His eyes look so real.

05:27.393 --> 05:30.294
"I don't know about you, but
Lisa's hungry for Chinese."

05:31.130 --> 05:33.064
I think
my wife's gone crazy.

05:33.132 --> 05:36.795
Oh, my God! This reminds me of
that poem from when we were kids.

05:36.969 --> 05:38.231
What poem?

05:38.404 --> 05:39.666
You remember. Come on.

05:39.739 --> 05:43.505
That old ghost story about the
woman who had all those dolls.

05:43.843 --> 05:46.073
"Beware the stare
of Mary Shaw

05:46.746 --> 05:48.873
"She had no children,
only dolls..."

05:49.582 --> 05:51.914
And something,
something scary.

05:52.885 --> 05:55.012
Something, something... Boo!

05:56.656 --> 05:59.318
I think you're having just a
little too much fun there, Lise.

05:59.392 --> 06:01.553
Oh, baby, I won't let
the scary dummy hurt you.

06:01.627 --> 06:03.288
Thank you. Thank you.

06:41.901 --> 06:43.493
If you get Jamie to scream,

06:44.003 --> 06:48.406
I'll make sure you get seven minutes
in heaven with my old Barbie. Deal?

06:49.175 --> 06:50.267
"Yes, Lisa."

06:51.711 --> 06:53.178
God, I'm such a loser.

07:18.838 --> 07:19.964
Good boy.

07:50.803 --> 07:51.997
Jamie?

07:54.173 --> 07:55.231
Jamie?

10:17.016 --> 10:18.347
Baby, I'm back.

10:26.626 --> 10:29.595
Lisa! What are you trying
to do? Burn the place down?

10:33.332 --> 10:34.321
Lise?

10:38.204 --> 10:39.535
Oh, Lisa.

10:41.807 --> 10:43.206
<i>I'm in here.</i>

10:46.012 --> 10:49.311
Dinner in bed again.

11:00.926 --> 11:02.052
Lisa!

11:03.262 --> 11:04.456
<i>Yes, Jamie?</i>

11:06.732 --> 11:07.892
What's going on?

11:11.537 --> 11:14.301
- <i>I have a surprise for you, Jamie.</i>
- <i>...for you, Jamie.</i>

11:30.022 --> 11:31.387
Lisa, this is not funny!

12:38.257 --> 12:40.851
The strange is that she's
got no defensive wounds.

12:40.926 --> 12:44.191
Now, if somebody was trying to
turn my face into a jack-o'-lantern,

12:44.263 --> 12:45.525
I'd be fighting back a little.

12:45.598 --> 12:49.034
Yeah, but then you always have
been a little feisty, my girl.

12:52.104 --> 12:53.196
Ligature marks?

12:53.272 --> 12:54.296
Not a one.

12:54.373 --> 12:56.273
- What about...
- Drugs?

12:57.009 --> 13:01.708
That's a gift. I think the words
here, and they come out there.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.271
Preliminary results say no.

13:03.349 --> 13:06.318
But the final tox results
won't be in for 48 hours.

13:06.385 --> 13:09.843
Personally, I think only someone
high as a kite would kill his wife

13:09.922 --> 13:11.287
and then pose her
as a mannequin.

13:11.357 --> 13:13.188
But the weirdest thing
is her face.

13:14.059 --> 13:15.890
I've never seen
anything like it.

13:30.876 --> 13:33.174
You know what it was?
Your mistake?

13:34.046 --> 13:35.377
It was the rose.

13:35.881 --> 13:38.850
Yep. Boy, I'll tell you,

13:39.018 --> 13:41.646
if I had a dollar for every time
some guy gave his wife a rose

13:41.720 --> 13:43.415
on the day that he,
you know...

13:44.089 --> 13:45.420
Like that's an alibi.

13:45.891 --> 13:47.085
Alibi?

13:49.028 --> 13:50.427
I didn't hear you.
Did you say something?

13:51.230 --> 13:52.561
Why would I need an alibi?

13:56.302 --> 13:58.327
I'm sure your lawyer
would want you to have one.

13:58.938 --> 13:59.962
My lawyer?

14:00.039 --> 14:01.063
Yeah.

14:01.140 --> 14:03.540
I mean, the prosecution, they're
going to have your fingerprints,

14:03.609 --> 14:05.406
no signs of forced entry
on your apartment,

14:05.477 --> 14:08.037
and you as the last person
to see your wife alive.

14:08.113 --> 14:09.671
I mean, that's a lot
to go up against.

14:10.916 --> 14:11.940
You think
I killed my wife?

14:12.017 --> 14:13.075
Excuse me?

14:14.520 --> 14:16.181
Do you think
I killed my wife?

14:17.389 --> 14:19.380
No. No, I don't think you did.

14:19.825 --> 14:21.656
I'm just trying
to help your lawyer out.

14:21.727 --> 14:23.957
I mean, he's going to need
something more concrete.

14:24.029 --> 14:27.089
I mean, at least to shift
the suspicion away from you.

14:27.266 --> 14:29.928
Suspicion? I mean, if you
want to talk suspicion,

14:30.002 --> 14:32.800
why don't you start by looking at the
package that turned up on my doorstep?

14:32.872 --> 14:35.340
Oh, yeah.
That package, right.

14:36.575 --> 14:38.736
Let's see. You received
an unmarked package

14:38.811 --> 14:40.574
just moments
before Lisa was killed.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.841
Yeah. A package containing
a ventriloquist dummy.

14:42.915 --> 14:44.212
Ventriloquist dummy. Yeah.

14:45.851 --> 14:49.082
Well, the mystery toy
department is down the hall.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.022
This is
the homicide department.

14:51.190 --> 14:53.488
So unless you can tell me
how some puppet

14:53.559 --> 14:56.585
ties into your wife's murder,
I don't see the relevance.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.963
In the town where I'm from,

15:03.969 --> 15:06.904
a ventriloquist dummy
is a bad omen.

15:07.606 --> 15:09.267
It's kind of a local legend,

15:09.642 --> 15:13.100
and some people believe that the dummy
brings death to those around them.

15:18.584 --> 15:19.642
Okay.

15:20.119 --> 15:21.609
Well, Jamie,

15:22.955 --> 15:26.118
I've never arrested a dummy
for murder before.

15:27.059 --> 15:29.152
But I have arrested
quite a few husbands.

15:30.696 --> 15:32.687
You don't think it's weird
that this package arrives

15:32.765 --> 15:34.130
right before Lisa is killed?

15:34.199 --> 15:36.497
No, I'll tell you
what I think is weird.

15:36.669 --> 15:41.129
You said that your wife spoke to you
just moments before you found her, right?

15:41.373 --> 15:43.500
- Yeah.
- Yeah. But she didn't have a tongue.

15:44.877 --> 15:47.175
In fact, according to you,
she was already dead.

15:47.947 --> 15:49.915
Now, see, to me, that's weird.

15:51.250 --> 15:54.219
So, what're you going to do?
Arrest me?

15:56.221 --> 15:57.245
Not yet.

16:00.259 --> 16:02.352
Look, you can go, Ashen.

16:03.729 --> 16:05.219
You're a free man for now.

16:07.399 --> 16:08.388
Good.

16:10.569 --> 16:12.764
It'll give me more time
to do your job for you.

19:08.080 --> 19:09.274
Jamie!

19:12.184 --> 19:14.379
I'm so sorry for your loss.

19:15.120 --> 19:17.588
But I'm so glad
to have you home.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.348
Oh!

19:20.425 --> 19:22.757
My Lord, you must think I'm so rude.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.160
We haven't even
been introduced.

19:25.264 --> 19:26.595
I'm Ella.

19:27.699 --> 19:28.688
I'm...

19:29.067 --> 19:32.298
Well, I guess
I'm your stepmother.

19:34.139 --> 19:35.265
Is he in?

19:35.340 --> 19:36.671
Yes, he is.

19:37.643 --> 19:38.735
Please come in.

19:38.810 --> 19:39.868
Thanks.

19:39.945 --> 19:42.345
There are some things that you
need to know about your father.

19:42.414 --> 19:43.938
I know everything I need to.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.583
Ella!
Who's down there with you?

19:46.652 --> 19:48.483
Your father won't
fight you, Jamie.

19:48.554 --> 19:50.579
He doesn't fight anyone,
not anymore.

19:50.656 --> 19:53.124
Well, then you're not
married to my father.

19:53.192 --> 19:54.352
Ella!

20:04.703 --> 20:06.261
I can hear you.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.799
Goddamn chair is stuck.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.534
Here, Edward,
let me help you.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.912
My son.
What a pleasant surprise.

20:24.523 --> 20:25.683
What happened to you?

20:25.757 --> 20:27.782
Your father had a stroke
two months ago.

20:27.859 --> 20:29.622
Why didn't anybody tell me?

20:29.695 --> 20:31.390
You never return my calls.

20:32.831 --> 20:34.856
It's because I never know
what to say to you.

20:34.933 --> 20:38.664
I take it I wasn't the easiest
person to get along with in the past,

20:39.438 --> 20:41.030
- but I've changed.
- Really?

20:41.106 --> 20:43.802
Yes. A stroke can do that
to a man.

20:44.943 --> 20:47.741
Listen, I'm sorry
about your wife.

20:48.513 --> 20:50.378
I hear you've
brought her home.

20:50.449 --> 20:52.110
- Yeah.
- Don't worry.

20:52.184 --> 20:54.744
I'll call Henry Walker,
make the arrangements.

20:54.820 --> 20:56.583
No, that's okay,
I can take care of it.

20:56.655 --> 20:59.852
Jamie, please. As your father,
it's the least I can do.

20:59.925 --> 21:01.916
You've done the least
you can do my whole life.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.258
It's too late
for charity now.

21:04.463 --> 21:06.260
Is that why you've come here,

21:06.331 --> 21:08.925
to remind me what a bad
father I've been to you?

21:09.001 --> 21:12.698
In light of what has happened, I was
hoping we could put that in the past.

21:12.771 --> 21:14.739
I didn't come
to talk about that, I...

21:14.806 --> 21:16.967
I came to ask you something.

21:19.144 --> 21:22.375
Do you remember when I was a
kid, Mom used to read me a poem?

21:22.447 --> 21:24.608
Do you remember what it was?

21:25.951 --> 21:27.350
What poem?

21:29.621 --> 21:32.181
"Beware the stare
of Mary Shaw

21:32.624 --> 21:35.149
"She had no children,
only dolls

21:35.427 --> 21:37.987
"And if you see her
in your dreams..."

21:38.797 --> 21:41.095
"Be sure you never,
ever scream"

21:41.166 --> 21:42.292
You know it?

21:42.367 --> 21:45.461
It's just a scary poem parents would
tell their kids to keep them in line.

21:45.537 --> 21:49.405
No. It's more than just a ghost story.
And the adults believed in it, as well.

21:49.474 --> 21:51.806
We live
in a small town, Jamie.

21:52.177 --> 21:55.340
Small minds breed
small-minded superstitions.

21:55.414 --> 21:57.382
That's all.
There's nothing else to tell.

21:57.449 --> 21:58.473
Nothing?

21:58.550 --> 21:59.574
Edward,

21:59.785 --> 22:01.616
your son has been
through a lot.

22:01.687 --> 22:04.212
Why don't we make up
a room for him?

22:04.623 --> 22:07.251
No, that's okay.
I'm not staying long.

22:07.693 --> 22:09.718
I got a funeral to prepare.

22:09.795 --> 22:11.729
Jamie, Jamie!

22:14.099 --> 22:16.124
Jamie! Please wait.

22:17.302 --> 22:18.633
Won't you stay the night here?

22:18.704 --> 22:20.569
It was nice meeting you, Ella.

22:20.639 --> 22:23.608
Your father's changed. He's not
the same man that you remember.

22:23.675 --> 22:24.937
Really?

22:27.112 --> 22:28.545
You see that?

22:28.613 --> 22:33.107
Mom used to be in that picture with
us, until he drove her to kill herself.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.915
Had his second wife
in that one there.

22:36.221 --> 22:38.086
But she was smart enough
to leave.

22:38.156 --> 22:40.522
So, it's a good thing you're
going to outlive him, lady.

22:40.592 --> 22:43.152
There'll be no one
to paint you out.

22:50.902 --> 22:52.233
What more?

22:54.005 --> 22:56.803
What more do you
want from me?

22:58.276 --> 23:00.540
Peck, peck, peck,
peck, peck, peck.

23:00.712 --> 23:04.011
I must say I was deeply
saddened to hear the news.

23:05.117 --> 23:09.952
If you're up to it, I can walk you
through the various casket options we have.

23:11.189 --> 23:13.020
Or we can do it later.

23:13.892 --> 23:16.554
It's okay.
Let's... Let's do it now.

23:16.728 --> 23:20.061
Okay. Now, I don't know
what your preferences are.

23:20.465 --> 23:22.933
Have you spoken
to her family yet?

23:23.435 --> 23:27.599
Only once. We didn't really
talk about casket choices.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.303
When is she arriving?

23:32.043 --> 23:33.510
Tonight.

23:35.013 --> 23:40.041
Once the police have released
her body, then I'll pick her up.

23:41.386 --> 23:46.619
Oh, I'll need you to fill out
these forms, at your convenience.

25:45.977 --> 25:47.137
<i>Jamie.</i>

25:48.380 --> 25:49.574
<i>Jamie!</i>

27:16.735 --> 27:18.600
No, it can't be.

27:29.547 --> 27:30.639
Marion?

27:31.549 --> 27:33.346
Marion, is that you?

27:39.958 --> 27:43.553
Marion, I told you
not to go down there anymore.

27:43.662 --> 27:44.993
The silent time's here.

27:45.063 --> 27:46.724
Now, come out of there
and go to bed.

27:46.798 --> 27:48.356
She's here now.

27:48.767 --> 27:49.825
I know it.

27:49.901 --> 27:50.959
Marion,

27:51.036 --> 27:53.004
I don't have time
to play games.

27:53.071 --> 27:54.902
She won't find me down here.

27:54.973 --> 27:57.237
Marion, I'm not
going to ask you again.

27:57.609 --> 27:59.975
Let's go. Come on, come on.

28:06.484 --> 28:08.952
You just shush now.

28:09.721 --> 28:10.847
The silent time is here.

28:10.922 --> 28:11.980
Go on.

28:12.057 --> 28:13.991
Go on up. I'll be up later.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.023
Did you see her? Did you?

29:57.095 --> 29:59.154
When she killed your wife?
Did you see her do it?

29:59.230 --> 30:01.323
Killed my wife?
What are you talking about?

30:01.399 --> 30:04.163
"Beware the stare
of Mary Shaw

30:04.469 --> 30:06.835
"She had no children,
only dolls

30:07.539 --> 30:09.131
"And if you see her
in your dreams..."

30:09.207 --> 30:10.435
Marion!

30:10.708 --> 30:12.676
She's here. No one's safe.

30:12.744 --> 30:13.938
- No one's safe.
- Come, Marion.

30:14.012 --> 30:16.480
- Marion, you leave him alone.
- No one's safe.

30:16.548 --> 30:18.914
- This is not the time.
- What's she talking about?

30:18.983 --> 30:21.110
I'm sorry, Jamie. She doesn't
know what she's saying.

30:21.186 --> 30:22.210
She's here!

30:22.287 --> 30:25.450
Come. I'm going to take you home
now. Let's go, let's go. Come on.

30:25.523 --> 30:28.924
You must bury the doll!
Bury the doll!

30:29.127 --> 30:31.254
Leave him alone.
Leave him alone. Come on.

30:31.429 --> 30:33.090
Marion, we'll go home now.

33:38.316 --> 33:39.874
Who dug you up?

35:23.488 --> 35:26.048
Thought I asked you
not to leave the city.

35:28.126 --> 35:30.890
I came to bury my wife.
You got a problem with that?

35:31.062 --> 35:32.051
Nope.

35:33.598 --> 35:36.590
Problem is, she's not the
only one that you came to bury.

35:37.435 --> 35:38.868
So, you've been
following me now?

35:40.638 --> 35:43.198
You know, Jamie,
you really are forcing me

35:43.274 --> 35:46.471
to use the word "perplexed"
an awful lot lately.

35:48.980 --> 35:52.643
You mind telling me
what the hell that is?

35:54.252 --> 35:57.710
Okay. Since you don't want
to answer my questions,

35:59.123 --> 36:00.886
maybe you'd like
to answer his.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.687
"Why did you bury me, Jamie?

36:07.231 --> 36:10.325
"Is it because I'm evidence
in a capital crime,

36:10.568 --> 36:14.231
"a crime that you are
the number one suspect in?"

36:20.745 --> 36:23.043
You understand
what I'm saying here?

36:23.114 --> 36:25.082
It's like I told you before.

36:25.149 --> 36:28.380
The night Lisa was murdered,
somebody sent it to me.

36:28.452 --> 36:30.716
It just arrived
on our doorstep.

36:31.556 --> 36:32.716
So, why'd you bury it?

36:32.790 --> 36:35.623
It came from that cemetery.
I was just putting it back.

36:35.693 --> 36:37.058
In the cemetery?

36:38.229 --> 36:42.097
There's an old ghost story around
here about a woman named Mary Shaw.

36:42.166 --> 36:44.066
She was buried
with her doll collection.

36:44.135 --> 36:47.935
Now, the story goes, "If you ever
see her, make sure you never scream."

36:48.005 --> 36:49.267
Or what?

36:50.474 --> 36:51.634
Oh.

36:52.977 --> 36:54.604
Or you end up
without a tongue.

36:54.745 --> 36:56.474
I guess your wife
didn't listen, then, huh?

36:56.581 --> 36:57.605
You son of a...

36:57.682 --> 36:58.740
Hey! Hey!

36:58.950 --> 37:00.281
Settle down, Jamie.

37:00.351 --> 37:04.185
Let's not add assaulting an officer
to your list of offenses here.

37:06.090 --> 37:09.253
So you're trying to tell me
that a ghost killed your wife?

37:09.427 --> 37:10.951
I don't know,
I don't know.

37:11.028 --> 37:12.188
What do you know?

37:12.263 --> 37:13.753
I do know
whoever sent this to me

37:13.831 --> 37:16.459
either knows who killed my
wife or did it themselves.

37:16.934 --> 37:18.026
Hmm.

37:18.502 --> 37:19.901
That's a theory.

37:20.938 --> 37:22.064
I'm going to go.

37:22.139 --> 37:27.338
And I hope you don't mind me taking
our little friend here with me,

37:27.645 --> 37:29.408
seeing as he's evidence
and all.

37:29.981 --> 37:31.107
Great.

37:34.652 --> 37:35.983
Good night, neighbor.

37:42.627 --> 37:43.924
Neighbor?

37:48.866 --> 37:50.231
Sleep tight.

38:13.457 --> 38:16.483
You know, I noticed
you have very smooth skin.

38:19.030 --> 38:20.588
What's your secret?

38:21.565 --> 38:22.657
Oh.

38:23.668 --> 38:25.932
Well, that never works for me.

39:06.444 --> 39:07.775
Friend of yours?

39:09.046 --> 39:11.480
You said Mary Shaw
killed my wife.

39:12.183 --> 39:13.616
Why would you say that?

39:13.684 --> 39:14.673
Marion.

39:15.219 --> 39:16.550
Marion, please!

39:17.755 --> 39:19.120
Yes, I know, I know...

39:19.190 --> 39:21.488
What do you know
about Mary Shaw?

39:22.727 --> 39:24.854
I didn't say anything! I...

39:28.499 --> 39:31.332
You're... You're not
supposed to have that.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.196
Where did you get that?

39:33.270 --> 39:35.170
Maybe you can tell me.

39:36.807 --> 39:37.865
It's hers!

39:37.942 --> 39:40.035
Who? Mary Shaw's?

39:41.445 --> 39:43.310
We don't say her name
around here.

39:43.381 --> 39:47.818
You don't say her name.
Well, why don't you try, huh?

39:49.420 --> 39:52.548
It might just help me
find out who killed my wife.

39:53.691 --> 39:58.924
There are things you remember, and
there are things you can't forget.

40:00.297 --> 40:03.528
Like the look on that
woman's face when she died.

40:06.070 --> 40:12.202
Her name was Mary Shaw, the
ventriloquist who lost her voice.

40:13.177 --> 40:17.170
Back when I was a boy, those were
the glory days of Ravens Fair,

40:17.481 --> 40:20.644
<i>and the town built itself</i>
<i>a grand old theater,</i>

40:21.218 --> 40:24.676
<i>the Guignol Theater,</i>
<i>out on Lost Lake.</i>

40:25.689 --> 40:29.125
<i>I only ever went there once.</i>

40:34.198 --> 40:37.634
Ladies and gentlemen,
prepare to be astounded.

40:37.701 --> 40:39.965
Prepare to be amazed.

40:40.037 --> 40:45.339
Witness Mary Shaw give life
to the boy made of wood.

41:00.257 --> 41:02.157
Where is Billy?

41:02.793 --> 41:04.283
Billy!

41:04.462 --> 41:07.158
Where are you, Billy?

41:07.231 --> 41:09.597
You won't find me, Mother!

41:11.702 --> 41:15.229
I knew
you were hiding out there!

41:15.906 --> 41:17.237
You, there!

41:20.244 --> 41:23.441
Could you check
under your seat for me?

41:30.554 --> 41:31.816
He's here!

41:32.056 --> 41:35.457
Would you mind
bringing him to me?

41:40.264 --> 41:42.095
Good boy.

41:48.439 --> 41:49.906
Say thank you.

41:50.407 --> 41:52.238
Thank you, Henry.

41:53.077 --> 41:54.840
Is that right, young man?

41:55.112 --> 41:57.808
Is your name Henry?

42:01.151 --> 42:06.418
Well, I guess my boy's
had his eye on you.

42:08.325 --> 42:11.351
Now, why did you
run away, Billy?

42:11.729 --> 42:13.697
Don't I treat you well?

42:13.898 --> 42:17.356
Oh, yes, you're the best
mother I could ever hope for!

42:17.635 --> 42:21.969
It's just that it gets so
dusty inside that little box,

42:22.339 --> 42:23.533
it makes me want to...

42:23.607 --> 42:25.234
- Want to what?
- Want to...

42:25.309 --> 42:26.435
Want to...

42:32.816 --> 42:33.976
Oh, Billy!

42:34.218 --> 42:37.381
You sneezed all over my shoe!

42:40.024 --> 42:42.754
I'm sorry, Mother.
I can't help it.

42:42.826 --> 42:44.817
I can see
your lips moving!

42:48.032 --> 42:49.260
What?

42:53.971 --> 42:55.404
Who said that?

42:55.472 --> 42:57.064
I did. I can see it.

42:57.341 --> 42:58.831
Her lips are moving.

43:00.811 --> 43:02.335
What do you say
to that, Billy?

43:02.413 --> 43:05.780
Young Michael here doesn't
think you're a real person!

43:05.849 --> 43:07.316
What do you mean, Mother?

43:07.384 --> 43:09.181
He thinks you're a dummy,

43:09.286 --> 43:11.948
and that I'm doing
your voice for you.

43:15.392 --> 43:17.360
But that can't be true!

43:17.461 --> 43:20.589
There's no way you'd give me
all the good lines!

43:20.731 --> 43:22.596
Forget about him, Billy!

43:22.666 --> 43:25.794
There will always be doubters!

43:26.203 --> 43:28.171
I don't want
to forget, Mother!

43:28.572 --> 43:31.769
I think we should show
this boy just how real I am.

43:31.842 --> 43:32.900
I'm just as real as him!

43:32.977 --> 43:34.035
No.

43:34.111 --> 43:36.978
I'm afraid we must go on with the show.

43:37.047 --> 43:39.572
No! I'm as real as you are,
and I'll show you!

43:39.650 --> 43:40.674
Leave him alone, Billy!

43:40.751 --> 43:41.809
I'll show him
what it's like, Mother!

43:41.885 --> 43:43.113
Listen to me! That's enough!

43:43.187 --> 43:44.211
I'm as real as you!

43:44.288 --> 43:45.880
- No more!
- Bring him up here!

44:00.070 --> 44:03.801
Now who's the dummy?

44:04.742 --> 44:08.576
Some weeks later, that disbelieving
little boy went missing.

44:08.646 --> 44:10.739
Gone without a trace.

44:12.149 --> 44:16.586
But I always felt that Mary
Shaw played some role in it.

44:16.787 --> 44:20.120
And not long after that,
she was murdered.

44:21.058 --> 44:22.355
Who killed her?

44:22.426 --> 44:23.654
No one ever found out.

44:24.161 --> 44:28.928
In her will, Mary stated that her
dummies were to be buried with her,

44:29.433 --> 44:32.891
her children,
as she called them.

44:32.970 --> 44:34.699
All 101 of them.

44:38.642 --> 44:41.941
<i>Her body was brought</i>
<i>to my father's mortuary,</i>

44:42.112 --> 44:46.549
so he could begin work
on her other final request.

44:50.187 --> 44:54.055
Not only did she ask
to be buried with her dolls,

44:54.224 --> 44:57.921
she asked to become
a doll herself.

47:05.255 --> 47:06.916
Henry, are you all right?

47:08.292 --> 47:13.787
Ever since she was buried, Ravens
Fair has been plagued by death,

47:13.964 --> 47:16.296
families murdered.

47:18.302 --> 47:20.998
They were found
without their tongues.

47:25.209 --> 47:28.007
Posed in family portraits.

47:33.317 --> 47:35.148
Your wife's is the last.

47:41.391 --> 47:43.757
How could you take
these pictures?

47:43.827 --> 47:46.694
No, I have to take pictures.
It's part of my business.

47:47.698 --> 47:50.064
Who would have dug up
the dummy and sent it to me?

47:50.133 --> 47:51.498
I don't know.

47:53.971 --> 47:57.930
No one in this town dares
speak Mary Shaw's name,

47:58.008 --> 48:00.135
let alone go near her grave.

48:00.711 --> 48:05.375
They know she won't stop
killing until the screaming does.

48:07.417 --> 48:10.284
You said she lived out
at that old theater, right?

48:10.387 --> 48:11.411
The one on Lost Lake?

48:11.488 --> 48:12.546
Jamie!

48:12.823 --> 48:14.347
Jamie, please!

48:18.095 --> 48:19.790
Please be careful.

48:20.597 --> 48:24.260
If you go looking for answers,
you just might find them.

48:24.334 --> 48:25.767
That's what I'm counting on.

48:58.802 --> 49:00.292
Morning, Mary.

49:00.370 --> 49:03.203
I'm just going to go
check in on the kids.

52:20.504 --> 52:25.635
<i>Mama! Mama! Mama.</i>

54:06.176 --> 54:08.144
What do you want
with him? What is it?

54:08.211 --> 54:11.044
What do you want?
We did what you wanted.

54:11.214 --> 54:14.581
We put you in there with
your family, all together.

54:15.752 --> 54:17.652
Why can't you
just leave us alone?

54:17.721 --> 54:19.245
<i>Why won't you?</i>

54:19.556 --> 54:20.784
I didn't do anything!

54:21.091 --> 54:24.060
<i>Yes, you did. You talked.</i>

54:24.294 --> 54:25.625
I didn't talk! I didn't!

54:26.062 --> 54:29.088
I didn't say anything!
I didn't!

54:32.435 --> 54:33.527
Hey!

54:34.771 --> 54:36.762
Say something.

54:38.241 --> 54:40.436
Why have you gone so quiet?

54:43.380 --> 54:45.905
I'm putting you back where
you belong, once and for all!

54:45.982 --> 54:47.279
- He talked to me!
- Stop it!

54:47.350 --> 54:50.046
He did, he talked to me,
he talked to me.

55:35.699 --> 55:36.859
Marion?

55:42.939 --> 55:46.272
Marion, I'm sorry
I yelled at you.

56:01.424 --> 56:02.686
Marion?

56:04.260 --> 56:06.694
You don't have
to hide anymore.

56:06.763 --> 56:08.594
This will all be over soon.

56:10.533 --> 56:11.693
Marion?

56:13.069 --> 56:14.127
Marion?

56:25.715 --> 56:28.240
Marion, now
you come on out now!

56:34.858 --> 56:36.052
Ma...

56:43.933 --> 56:45.264
Marion?

56:55.211 --> 56:56.769
Marion, open the door.

56:58.014 --> 57:00.744
Marion! Come on,
no games, Marion!

57:00.817 --> 57:02.444
Open the door!

57:23.706 --> 57:26.869
Marion, open this door,
please! Marion!

57:27.043 --> 57:29.102
<i>Hello, Henry!</i>

57:53.670 --> 57:55.001
Oh, my God.

58:13.423 --> 58:17.223
<i>You're voice</i>
<i>is mine now, Henry.</i>

58:32.976 --> 58:35.103
Jamie, you're
just in time for dinner.

58:35.178 --> 58:36.202
I'm not hungry.

58:36.279 --> 58:37.337
It's soup.

58:37.413 --> 58:39.677
Delicious, too,
if I must say so myself.

58:39.749 --> 58:41.444
I'll vouch for that.

58:42.452 --> 58:44.420
I didn't come here to eat,
I came to talk

58:44.854 --> 58:46.219
about Mary Shaw.

58:48.324 --> 58:49.382
You lied to me.

58:49.459 --> 58:50.517
No, I didn't.

58:52.362 --> 58:54.023
- Sit down.
- No, I want the truth.

58:54.097 --> 58:57.624
What does Michael Ashen and our
family have to do with Mary Shaw?

58:59.702 --> 59:00.828
Fine.

59:02.472 --> 59:03.871
When he was a boy,

59:03.940 --> 59:08.001
your great-uncle, Michael
Ashen, vanished without a trace.

59:10.647 --> 59:13.707
For our family, there
was only ever one suspect,

59:13.983 --> 59:15.041
Mary Shaw.

59:15.818 --> 59:18.082
So, they dealt
their own justice.

59:21.024 --> 59:22.616
<i>They forced her to scream.</i>

59:25.929 --> 59:27.920
Then cut out her tongue.

59:28.331 --> 59:29.662
Our family killed her?

59:29.732 --> 59:31.700
Along with others
from Ravens Fair.

59:33.736 --> 59:35.761
But she didn't stay dead.

59:36.873 --> 59:39.501
She came back
and took her revenge.

59:40.777 --> 59:44.543
One by one, each of the men
involved were killed.

59:45.348 --> 59:47.373
Their tongues ripped out.

59:47.984 --> 59:50.475
And then the same thing
happened to their wives.

59:51.287 --> 59:53.346
And then their children.

59:53.423 --> 59:55.482
And their children's children.

59:55.558 --> 59:58.618
All these years you've resented
me for sending you away,

59:58.695 --> 01:00:01.892
but I did it to distance you
from this curse.

01:00:02.732 --> 01:00:04.029
Distance?

01:00:04.367 --> 01:00:05.698
Well, it found Lisa!

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:09.397
Lisa's death made me realize
we can't run from our fate.

01:00:10.907 --> 01:00:12.875
Spirits have long memories.

01:00:15.011 --> 01:00:17.138
She'll come for us in the end.

01:00:17.513 --> 01:00:19.481
Now I'm paying
for the sins of my fathers.

01:00:19.549 --> 01:00:21.107
Jamie, I'm sorry.

01:00:21.284 --> 01:00:25.653
All I ever meant to do was to protect
you, even if it earned your hatred.

01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:27.849
I don't know how,
but one way or another,

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:31.119
I'm going to stop this thing.

01:00:32.195 --> 01:00:33.628
Please, Son!

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:36.395
Well, hey, there!

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:39.367
I was wondering if you could help
me with a missing person's case.

01:00:39.435 --> 01:00:40.459
Wait.

01:00:41.237 --> 01:00:44.297
I'm looking for a male, brown
hair, he's around this tall,

01:00:44.774 --> 01:00:47.299
sometimes seen
with a hand up his ass.

01:00:47.644 --> 01:00:51.944
Actually, his brothers and sisters
have just gone missing, too.

01:00:52.415 --> 01:00:53.746
What are you talking about?

01:00:53.816 --> 01:00:54.908
Somebody dug them up.

01:00:56.319 --> 01:00:57.377
All 100 of them.

01:00:58.521 --> 01:01:01.285
What I want to know is
who did it and why.

01:01:01.357 --> 01:01:02.619
So do I!

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:06.295
Don't give me some ghost story about
a woman who kills you if you scream,

01:01:06.462 --> 01:01:08.589
because nobody in this town
has ever heard of Mary Shaw

01:01:08.665 --> 01:01:09.791
or your little fairy tale.

01:01:09.866 --> 01:01:10.890
They're lying!

01:01:11.034 --> 01:01:12.262
They're afraid!

01:01:12.335 --> 01:01:13.393
Afraid of what?

01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:15.134
Afraid of ghosts?

01:01:15.238 --> 01:01:18.901
Or are they afraid of talking to the cop
who's investigating your wife's murder?

01:01:18.975 --> 01:01:21.273
They have no reason
to protect me.

01:01:22.211 --> 01:01:24.372
But they believe in Mary Shaw.

01:01:25.081 --> 01:01:26.776
That's why they won't answer
your stupid questions.

01:01:26.849 --> 01:01:30.250
No, it's you who won't
answer my questions, Jamie.

01:01:30.319 --> 01:01:32.184
That's why I'm going to arrest
you for stealing evidence.

01:01:32.255 --> 01:01:33.745
Then I'm going to sit
you down, and you will...

01:01:33.823 --> 01:01:36.155
What do you want
me to tell you?

01:01:36.359 --> 01:01:38.486
Something less perplexing
than a ghost story. Come on.

01:01:38.861 --> 01:01:41.796
Jamie, is everything
all right?

01:01:45.802 --> 01:01:48.032
It's for you.
They said it was urgent.

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:51.466
Go ahead.

01:01:55.144 --> 01:01:56.304
- Hello?
- <i>Jamie.</i>

01:01:56.679 --> 01:01:57.805
Who is this?

01:01:59.582 --> 01:02:00.879
<i>Jamie?</i>

01:02:01.050 --> 01:02:02.039
Henry?

01:02:02.885 --> 01:02:04.045
<i>I can prove it.</i>

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.486
Henry, I can't hear you,
you're breaking up.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:08.088
<i>I can prove it.</i>

01:02:08.624 --> 01:02:10.785
<i>I can... you didn't kill her.</i>

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:14.225
<i>There's a way, at the theater.</i>

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:16.356
<i>Meet me at the theater.</i>
<i>It's on Lost Lake.</i>

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:17.729
Yeah, I know where it is.

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:19.733
<i>Now, Jamie.</i>

01:02:20.803 --> 01:02:22.964
Henry, wait!
What have you found?

01:02:23.673 --> 01:02:25.732
Henry! Henry!

01:02:30.379 --> 01:02:32.108
That was Henry Walker
from the funeral home.

01:02:32.248 --> 01:02:34.512
He says he can prove
I didn't kill my wife.

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:36.677
Convenient time for
him to call. Let's go.

01:02:36.753 --> 01:02:38.744
Wait, wait, wait. I'm going
to meet him at the theater.

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:39.845
That's where I'm going.

01:02:39.922 --> 01:02:41.014
No, you're going with me.

01:02:41.090 --> 01:02:42.557
Your appointment
with me comes first.

01:02:42.625 --> 01:02:45.059
You wanted answers.
I'm giving you answers.

01:02:45.128 --> 01:02:48.120
Camp is over. I'm done with
the ghost stories. Let's go.

01:02:48.364 --> 01:02:51.822
Listen, we're talking
about my wife here. Come on.

01:02:56.005 --> 01:02:57.996
Do us both a favor, Jamie.

01:02:58.441 --> 01:03:00.500
Don't make me cuff you
in front of your mom.

01:03:05.314 --> 01:03:06.542
Jamie!

01:03:07.884 --> 01:03:09.977
Jamie. Jamie!

01:03:10.219 --> 01:03:13.154
Hey, you don't want
to make me chase you!

01:03:13.222 --> 01:03:14.211
Jamie!

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:18.827
I don't have
a full tank of gas!

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.252
Jamie!

01:04:31.767 --> 01:04:32.859
Henry?

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:36.131
Jamie!

01:04:51.087 --> 01:04:52.145
Hello?

01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:54.780
Where are you?

01:04:56.492 --> 01:04:57.652
Henry?

01:05:05.968 --> 01:05:06.957
Henry?

01:05:20.149 --> 01:05:21.480
Henry?

01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:25.086
<i>Come on, Jamie.</i>
<i>I'm up here.</i>

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:27.813
I'm coming, Jamie.

01:06:03.326 --> 01:06:04.315
Jamie?

01:06:06.095 --> 01:06:07.392
I know you're here.

01:06:09.932 --> 01:06:11.422
<i>I'm in here.</i>

01:06:30.252 --> 01:06:31.446
Henry?

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:49.695
Henry?

01:06:49.772 --> 01:06:50.830
Guess again.

01:06:54.076 --> 01:06:55.202
He's here.

01:06:55.277 --> 01:06:58.178
Nobody's here. Our boats
were the only two out there.

01:06:58.247 --> 01:06:59.874
Listen, I'm telling you
he's here!

01:06:59.949 --> 01:07:01.075
And I'm telling you

01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:03.618
he is not here!

01:07:03.886 --> 01:07:05.376
<i>Yes, he is.</i>

01:07:09.525 --> 01:07:12.619
If you say I told you so,
I'll shoot you.

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:18.856
Where the hell are you?

01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:44.282
Hang on to this for a second.

01:07:45.861 --> 01:07:47.226
Where are you going?

01:08:02.344 --> 01:08:04.744
Remember, whatever happens,

01:08:05.247 --> 01:08:06.373
don't scream.

01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:12.449
Jamie. Jamie?

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:17.917
Jamie?

01:08:20.261 --> 01:08:21.354
Jamie!

01:08:27.770 --> 01:08:29.260
You follow me.

01:08:30.339 --> 01:08:31.430
Yes, sir.

01:09:24.926 --> 01:09:28.453
All right, Jamie,
where is he?

01:09:39.073 --> 01:09:41.304
You know, if I see
one more of these...

01:09:54.924 --> 01:09:56.448
They're all here.

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:12.900
Yep.

01:10:15.945 --> 01:10:16.934
All home.

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:29.488
Someone brought them
back here.

01:10:41.971 --> 01:10:43.632
All but one.

01:10:45.074 --> 01:10:46.200
What?

01:10:50.079 --> 01:10:51.546
What the hell is that?

01:11:16.372 --> 01:11:17.805
Is that a doll?

01:11:23.846 --> 01:11:25.336
It's not a doll.

01:11:27.816 --> 01:11:29.147
It's a boy.

01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:39.122
You mean, it was a boy.

01:11:48.771 --> 01:11:51.205
- It's me.
- All right, I get it.

01:11:52.207 --> 01:11:55.608
I think we just solved a
70-year-old missing person's case.

01:11:55.678 --> 01:11:57.202
Who was that?

01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:01.379
A long-lost relative.

01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:07.378
This is how it starts.

01:12:10.092 --> 01:12:11.684
What's going on here, Jamie?

01:12:39.688 --> 01:12:40.950
Jamie.

01:13:21.230 --> 01:13:22.720
What the...

01:13:58.567 --> 01:13:59.556
Mary Shaw?

01:14:05.774 --> 01:14:07.139
Mary Shaw?

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.913
<i>Clever.</i>

01:14:15.083 --> 01:14:16.380
Who's there?

01:14:16.618 --> 01:14:17.744
Show yourself!

01:14:18.053 --> 01:14:19.213
Come out!

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:22.088
What do you want?

01:14:27.296 --> 01:14:32.563
<i>To silence all those</i>
<i>who silenced me.</i>

01:14:34.436 --> 01:14:37.064
Is that why you killed
Michael Ashen?

01:14:37.806 --> 01:14:41.037
<i>So hard to construct</i>

01:14:41.410 --> 01:14:43.708
<i>the perfect doll.</i>

01:14:44.513 --> 01:14:48.973
<i>Sometimes you have</i>
<i>to use existing parts.</i>

01:14:50.185 --> 01:14:53.348
"I love you, Mommy.
I love you, Mommy."

01:14:53.522 --> 01:14:54.682
<i>"I love you.</i>

01:14:55.324 --> 01:14:57.155
<i>"I love you, Mommy."</i>

01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.520
Why Lisa?

01:15:00.529 --> 01:15:02.759
Why did you take her from me?

01:15:04.233 --> 01:15:09.170
<i>Come closer and I'll tell you.</i>

01:15:13.242 --> 01:15:15.676
Don't go back there. Don't.

01:15:15.777 --> 01:15:17.904
Come on, come on. Don't go.

01:15:28.857 --> 01:15:31.291
<i>Come closer.</i>

01:15:31.460 --> 01:15:34.190
<i>I'll whisper it to you.</i>

01:15:58.921 --> 01:16:02.118
<i>You weren't the last Ashen.</i>

01:16:03.191 --> 01:16:07.355
<i>The last Ashen was inside her.</i>

01:16:42.898 --> 01:16:44.126
Don't scream.

01:16:58.580 --> 01:16:59.604
The doll!

01:17:03.518 --> 01:17:05.816
What the hell's
going on here, Jamie?

01:17:08.757 --> 01:17:09.951
What's going on?

01:17:10.025 --> 01:17:11.083
She's living in the dolls!

01:17:11.159 --> 01:17:12.183
What?

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:13.591
She's living in the dolls!

01:17:15.931 --> 01:17:17.091
Destroy the dolls!

01:17:17.165 --> 01:17:18.223
I am!

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:22.500
All of the dolls!

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:37.009
Jamie! Run!

01:17:51.533 --> 01:17:52.591
Come on!

01:20:34.362 --> 01:20:35.624
One left.

01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:00.816
Henry!

01:21:04.159 --> 01:21:05.217
Henry!

01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:15.833
Please. Please.

01:21:25.981 --> 01:21:27.949
Please.

01:21:30.318 --> 01:21:31.307
Please.

01:21:32.387 --> 01:21:35.379
Please say

01:21:36.191 --> 01:21:37.317
something.

01:21:37.392 --> 01:21:38.450
Shit.

01:21:41.263 --> 01:21:44.289
Marion. Marion, listen to me.
Where is the dummy?

01:21:44.733 --> 01:21:46.360
- He took it.
- Who took it?

01:21:46.434 --> 01:21:47.423
Who took it?

01:21:47.502 --> 01:21:49.026
Mr. Ashen.

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:50.401
Mr...

01:21:50.839 --> 01:21:53.273
Marion, my father
is in a wheelchair.

01:21:53.341 --> 01:21:55.366
He never leaves the house.

01:21:55.543 --> 01:21:59.411
He left this house.
He had the doll.

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:02.609
It was him.

01:23:47.622 --> 01:23:49.715
<i>Why did you</i>
<i>bury me, Jamie?</i>

01:23:52.727 --> 01:23:54.194
<i>I'm in here!</i>

01:25:37.499 --> 01:25:38.557
Dad?

01:25:50.912 --> 01:25:55.008
I take it I wasn't the easiest
person to get along with in the past,

01:25:55.083 --> 01:25:56.380
but I've changed.

01:25:56.451 --> 01:25:57.645
Jamie!

01:25:58.486 --> 01:26:00.249
<i>Soup! Delicious, too.</i>

01:26:00.321 --> 01:26:01.686
<i>I'll vouch for that.</i>

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:08.627
<i>Jamie, I can prove</i>
<i>you didn't kill her.</i>

01:26:11.900 --> 01:26:14.892
<i>Jamie!</i>
<i>So glad to have you home.</i>

01:26:31.419 --> 01:26:34.047
Now who's the dummy?

01:26:35.757 --> 01:26:39.090
No!

01:26:56.411 --> 01:26:58.606
<i>"Beware the stare</i>
<i>of Mary Shaw</i>

01:26:59.247 --> 01:27:01.545
<i>"She had no children,</i>
<i>only dolls</i>

01:27:02.717 --> 01:27:05.117
<i>"And if you see her</i>
