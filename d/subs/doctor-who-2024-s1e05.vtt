00:19.040 --> 00:20.320
- Dot.

00:21.640 --> 00:22.760
And, Bubble.

00:27.760 --> 00:28.920
<i>Hi there, Lindy.</i>

00:28.920 --> 00:30.480
<i>Such a super day.</i>

00:30.480 --> 00:32.240
<i>You look so good, baby!</i>

00:32.240 --> 00:35.280
Aw, Cooper, you're so kind.

00:35.280 --> 00:36.840
<i>Kindness all day long.</i>

00:36.840 --> 00:38.440
<i>Good morning to you. Another day.</i>

00:38.440 --> 00:40.640
<i>Don't lie in bed, Lindy girl.</i>

00:40.640 --> 00:43.080
<i>Hup, hup, hup! Today is toasty.</i>

00:43.080 --> 00:45.280
<i>This day is already too much.</i>

00:45.280 --> 00:46.840
<i>I'm so tired of this, babes.</i>

00:46.840 --> 00:49.000
<i>I heard from Lucien.
He said he's so sorry.</i>

00:49.000 --> 00:53.440
<i>He said he made a mistake, and it
turns out that woman was her sister!</i>

00:53.440 --> 00:54.520


00:54.520 --> 00:56.040
<i>I was laughing so hard!</i>

00:56.040 --> 00:57.480
Hey, where's Jimbo?

00:57.480 --> 00:59.320
He always wakes up first.

00:59.320 --> 01:02.760
Jimbo? Jimbo Fennell? Jim?

01:02.760 --> 01:05.040
Come on, Jimbo. Wake up.

01:05.040 --> 01:07.360
<i>Have you heard from Mabel and Neve?</i>

01:07.360 --> 01:08.840
<i>It's like they've disappeared.</i>

01:08.840 --> 01:10.760
<i>I tried to link, but they're gone.</i>

01:10.760 --> 01:14.560
<i>Lindy babes, you lie there much longer,
and your blood is going to pool.</i>

01:14.560 --> 01:16.440
<i>I said get up!</i>

01:16.440 --> 01:17.520
<i>Stand up.</i>

01:19.040 --> 01:21.440
<i>Turn left. Forward.</i>

01:22.080 --> 01:23.080
<i>Forward.</i>

01:23.600 --> 01:24.880
<i>Forward.</i>

01:24.880 --> 01:25.960
<i>Turn left.</i>

01:26.640 --> 01:30.760
<i>Forward.</i>

01:30.760 --> 01:31.920
<i>Turn right.</i>

01:31.920 --> 01:33.000
<i>Forward.</i>

01:33.000 --> 01:34.080
<i>Stop.</i>

01:34.080 --> 01:35.280
Do I need to pee?

01:35.280 --> 01:37.920
<i>Urine content is zero
for the third day in a row.</i>

01:37.920 --> 01:39.800
<i>Well done, Lindy.</i>

01:39.800 --> 01:42.480
<i>Remember,
don't waste the day with daily waste.</i>

01:44.240 --> 01:46.360
- <i>Oh, my days. Have you seen?</i>
- <i>Can't breathe. Cannot breathe.</i>

01:46.360 --> 01:48.280
- <i>Have you seen? He's made a new post.</i>
- <i>He is amazing!</i>

01:48.280 --> 01:51.040
<i>Oh, Lindy,
Ricky September is so beautiful.</i>

01:51.040 --> 01:53.760
- <i>If I ever met him, I would simply die.</i>
- <i>He chose me. He loves me, Lindy!</i>

01:53.760 --> 01:55.200
Oh, wow.

01:56.440 --> 01:57.520
Open Ricky September.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.360
Oh, my goodness.

<i>and your life is in danger, okay?</i>

02:10.840 --> 02:13.320
<i>There are creatures out there

02:13.320 --> 02:15.400
<i>There are monsters,

02:15.400 --> 02:16.480
<i>No. No, Lindy, don't--</i>

<i>Finetime News,
where everything's fine all of the time.</i>

03:15.360 --> 03:17.880
<i>Leave those Homeworld blues behind.</i>

03:17.880 --> 03:23.040
<i>And the weather report says
it's another glorious day in Finetime,</i>

03:23.640 --> 03:24.640
<i>in theory.</i>

03:25.200 --> 03:30.040
<i>Not gonna lie. We've got a little bit
of trouble with the weather satellite.</i>

03:30.040 --> 03:33.240
<i>But we'll get that fixed
as soon as we can.</i>

03:33.240 --> 03:35.360
<i>Have a fine time in Finetime.</i>

03:35.360 --> 03:39.040
So, my socks are a cotton
derivative, and my shoes are retrobuffed.

03:39.040 --> 03:40.760
- I love them so much.
<i>Forward.</i>

03:40.760 --> 03:43.680
The T-shirt is a classic design
from the year Five-5.

03:43.680 --> 03:45.400
- I adore it.
<i>Forward.</i>

03:45.400 --> 03:46.800
<i>Oh, you look so beautiful, Lindy!</i>

03:46.800 --> 03:48.200
And the thread is sourced from refurb,

03:48.200 --> 03:50.120
so I'm not depleting
any of Finetime's resources.

03:50.120 --> 03:51.200
I'm so careful about that.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.200
<i>Oh, I wish I could look like you.</i>

03:53.200 --> 03:56.640
And I have the same in teal, lilac,
and summer green. It's so soft.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.800
<i>I'm gonna buy that. I'm gonna buy 100.</i>

03:58.800 --> 04:01.800
I know I probably shouldn't say this,
but I look so cute.

04:01.800 --> 04:04.840
- <i>You are influencing me hard, girl!</i>
<i>Turn right. Turn right.</i>

04:04.840 --> 04:07.120
- <i>Turn left.</i>

04:07.120 --> 04:08.720
- <i>Forward.</i>

04:08.720 --> 04:10.600
<i>Forward.</i>

04:10.600 --> 04:12.040
Hey, guys.

04:12.040 --> 04:17.160
If you haven't seen my new outfit
I posted today, I thought it was so cute.

04:17.160 --> 04:19.280
<i>That's great.</i>
- Do you think so?

04:19.280 --> 04:22.720
It's so unfair.
Now we have to work.

04:22.720 --> 04:25.760
Finetime never told us
how boring it would be.

04:25.760 --> 04:28.320
<i>Boring.</i>
- <i>I like it.</i>

04:28.320 --> 04:30.440
Oh, you're so well behaved, Alan.

04:30.440 --> 04:31.520
<i>No.</i>

04:31.520 --> 04:33.200
<i>We are helping the community</i>

04:33.200 --> 04:36.760
<i>to make Finetime the number one centre
for substack processing.</i>

04:37.360 --> 04:38.640
<i>Who am I kidding?</i>

04:38.640 --> 04:40.760
- <i>Boring!</i>

04:41.400 --> 04:45.680
<i>All this work, it chaps my hands.
Like, I get really bad hand-chapping.</i>

04:45.680 --> 04:47.680
Isn't chapping a funny word?

04:47.680 --> 04:49.360
<i>Oh, crazy days. It so is!</i>

04:49.360 --> 04:50.880
<i>I love that word!</i>

04:50.880 --> 04:53.240
- <i>Chap, chap!</i>
- <i>I get chapping everywhere.</i>

04:54.080 --> 04:55.120
<i>I'm serious, Lindy.</i>

04:55.120 --> 04:57.480
<i>Now there's no sign of Zackary.
Like, he's disappeared.</i>

04:57.480 --> 04:59.680
<i>So I went to ask Rooster, but he's gone--</i>

04:59.680 --> 05:01.320
You're no fun.

05:02.040 --> 05:03.280
- <i>Hi there, Lindy.</i>

05:03.280 --> 05:06.240
<i>I'm just doing a system check
on behalf of Finetime Enterprises.</i>

05:06.240 --> 05:08.320
<i>Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?</i>

05:08.320 --> 05:09.480
Who are you?

05:09.480 --> 05:11.320
<i>My name's Ruby Sunday. Hi!</i>

05:11.320 --> 05:12.720
You're not on my friends list.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.920
<i>I know, but please?
Everyone keeps turning me down.</i>

05:14.920 --> 05:16.120
<i>Superplease, Lindy?</i>

05:16.120 --> 05:17.560
<i>Oh, I love that top.</i>

05:19.120 --> 05:20.120
Okay.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.200
What do you want to know?

05:21.200 --> 05:22.280
<i>Thank you.</i>

05:22.280 --> 05:24.720
<i>Can you tell me
what are you doing right now?</i>

05:24.720 --> 05:26.800
My life, you're stupid.

05:26.800 --> 05:28.440
<i>Yes, let's say I'm stupid.</i>

05:28.440 --> 05:29.840
<i>I know nothing.</i>

05:29.840 --> 05:30.920
<i>So what are you doing?</i>

05:30.920 --> 05:33.320
- This is work.
- <i>And work is?</i>

05:33.320 --> 05:35.640
Oh, my gasp. Child.

05:35.640 --> 05:37.400
Work is data processing.

05:37.400 --> 05:40.640
We clean up substack information
and deliver it back to the Homeworld.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.720
Do you approve?

05:41.720 --> 05:44.520
<i>That's great. And everyone does this?
The whole city?</i>

05:44.520 --> 05:45.720
How stupid can you--

05:45.720 --> 05:47.520
We all work two hours a day.

05:47.520 --> 05:49.000
Two long hours.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.320
And then we get the rest of the day free.
Isn't it obvious?

05:51.320 --> 05:53.680
<i>And you work in an office of six?</i>
- That is correct.

05:53.680 --> 05:56.080
- <i>Who are the six?</i>
Come on.

05:56.080 --> 05:58.840
Okay. There's Danny and Vista Jay--
they're brother and sister--

05:58.840 --> 06:01.240
plus Molly Champion, Sandy Brook
and Bertie Lester.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.120
<i>And where are they?</i>

06:03.120 --> 06:04.480
They're at work.

06:04.480 --> 06:05.760
It's work time.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.520
- <i>So they're in the same room as you?</i>
Yes.

06:08.520 --> 06:10.320
Danny and Vista Jay sit at the front.

06:10.320 --> 06:12.880
Next row back, in front of them,
Molly Champion and Sandy Brook.

06:12.880 --> 06:14.240
Bertie and I are at the back.

06:14.240 --> 06:17.280
<i>And are they there?</i>
- Are they where?

06:17.280 --> 06:19.320
<i>At their desks?</i>
- How should I know?

06:19.320 --> 06:20.600
<i>You're in the same room.</i>

06:20.600 --> 06:22.160
What am I supposed to do? Look?

06:22.160 --> 06:23.440
<i>Well, yes.</i>

06:23.440 --> 06:25.000
You are so ridiculous.

06:25.000 --> 06:28.160
If you want to talk to Danny Jay,
you can talk to him on here. Danny?

06:29.040 --> 06:31.000
Danny. Are you there?

06:31.600 --> 06:32.600
<i>So where is he?</i>

06:32.600 --> 06:36.040
Danny? Danny Jay? Hello?

06:36.040 --> 06:38.320
<i>Well, technically,
he's in the same room.</i>

06:38.320 --> 06:40.240
<i>He's sitting two rows in front of you,
isn't he?</i>

06:40.240 --> 06:41.640
He must be.

06:41.640 --> 06:44.120
<i>You could always see if he's there
with your own eyes.</i>

06:44.120 --> 06:47.000
<i>I mean, you could lower your Bubble.</i>

06:47.000 --> 06:48.240
Lower it?

06:48.760 --> 06:49.920
You mean turn it off?

06:49.920 --> 06:51.120
<i>For a second.</i>

06:51.120 --> 06:52.600
That's not what we do in Finetime.

06:52.600 --> 06:55.040
You are so offensive.

06:55.040 --> 06:56.120
<i>I'm not kidding.</i>

06:56.120 --> 06:59.320
<i>Olive has disappeared, and Kipper,
and no one's heard from Alannah--</i>

07:00.000 --> 07:01.440
I slid you!

07:01.440 --> 07:02.840
<i>I promise I will leave you alone</i>

07:02.840 --> 07:05.240
<i>if you could just look at
the four desks in front of you.</i>

07:05.240 --> 07:08.560
I am not lowering my Bubble.

07:08.560 --> 07:12.400
<i>Okay, can you stay inside
and look beyond it? Can you do that?</i>

07:12.400 --> 07:13.960
I can do whatever I want.

07:13.960 --> 07:16.160
- <i>Then could you try?</i>

07:24.280 --> 07:25.480
<i>What can you see?</i>

07:26.920 --> 07:28.240
There's no one there.

07:29.360 --> 07:31.520
<i>Okay! That's fine. Thank you.</i>

07:34.840 --> 07:35.840
Where are they?

07:36.560 --> 07:37.760
<i>That's why I asked.</i>

07:37.760 --> 07:39.760
They can't not be here.

07:39.760 --> 07:41.320
We all have to work. It's what we do.

07:41.320 --> 07:42.800
We work, and then we play.

07:43.760 --> 07:44.760
<i>Okay.</i>

07:44.760 --> 07:47.480
<i>Now this is going to be tough,
but I am here with you, Lindy,</i>

07:47.480 --> 07:49.120
<i>because according to the chart,</i>

07:49.120 --> 07:51.440
<i>Bertie Lester sits next to you,
to your right.</i>

07:51.440 --> 07:53.800
- <i>Bertie sits about ten feet away.</i>
- Yes.

07:53.800 --> 07:56.480
- <i>Is he there?</i>
Who cares!

07:56.480 --> 08:01.240
<i>Lindy, I want you to be very careful,
and look to your right.</i>

08:20.240 --> 08:21.760
I'd like to get back to work now.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.440
<i>What did you see?</i>

08:23.440 --> 08:25.000
I need to get back to work.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.880
- <i>Lindy, what did you see?</i>

08:26.880 --> 08:29.120
I-- I don't know.

08:29.760 --> 08:32.720
<i>Okay, but I'm stuck outside Finetime.
I can't see in.</i>

08:32.720 --> 08:35.760
<i>If you could just lower your Bubble,
turn off the Dot and look.</i>

08:35.760 --> 08:37.080
<i>Just for a second.</i>

08:37.080 --> 08:39.240
<i>Then come back inside,
and tell me what's out there.</i>

08:39.240 --> 08:41.560
I-I'd rather get back to work.

08:41.560 --> 08:45.160
<i>I know, and I'm sorry, but we really need
to know what you're sitting next to.</i>

08:50.680 --> 08:52.680
- Bubble, down. Dot, off.

09:30.720 --> 09:32.000
- Dot, Bubble.

09:32.000 --> 09:34.080
<i>Lindy, it's okay. I'm here.</i>

09:34.080 --> 09:36.400
<i>Can you tell me what you saw?</i>

09:36.400 --> 09:39.000
<i>I'm sorry,
but your need to urinate has skyrocketed.</i>

09:41.080 --> 09:42.600
<i>So, here's a plan.</i>

09:42.600 --> 09:45.120
<i>After work,
we can all plug into Aqua Marina?</i>

09:47.680 --> 09:48.760
<i>What is that noise?</i>

09:48.760 --> 09:50.120
Play Ricky September.

09:54.600 --> 09:58.640
<i>♪ Itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny
Yellow polka dot bikini ♪</i>

09:58.640 --> 10:01.240
<i>♪ That she wore for the first time today ♪</i>

10:01.240 --> 10:02.360
<i>♪ Ah, yeah ♪</i>

10:02.360 --> 10:04.120
<i>♪ An itsy-bitsy, teeny-weeny ♪</i>

10:04.120 --> 10:05.960
<i>♪ Yellow polka dot bikini ♪</i>

10:07.320 --> 10:08.440
<i>Lindy.</i>

10:09.880 --> 10:14.200
<i>Lindy, I'm sorry, but if I'm right,
I think you saw some kind of thing.</i>

10:14.200 --> 10:16.760
<i>But I've got a friend.
He knows how to deal with it. I promise.</i>

10:16.760 --> 10:18.400
<i>Here he is.</i>

10:18.400 --> 10:20.600
Just leave me alone, will you?

10:20.600 --> 10:22.720
This is just getting so ridiculous.

10:22.720 --> 10:24.800
<i>No, I know. I know. But come on, babes.</i>

10:24.800 --> 10:26.360
<i>We need to get you out of there.</i>

10:26.360 --> 10:29.280
Is that thing--
Is it something to do with you?

10:29.280 --> 10:31.760
<i>No. I'm trying to find out what it is,</i>

10:31.760 --> 10:34.040
<i>but first things first,
I'm here to save you.</i>

10:34.040 --> 10:37.080
<i>Okay? So I want you
to stand up and walk out,</i>

10:37.600 --> 10:38.600
<i>but without the Bubble.</i>

10:38.600 --> 10:39.600
I-I can't do that.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.200
<i>You need to lower the Bubble,
because there are more of them.</i>

10:42.200 --> 10:43.800
- More?
- <i>I think so.</i>

10:43.800 --> 10:44.960
<i>It's not just your office,</i>

10:44.960 --> 10:47.040
<i>and I don't think
your Dot-system can see them.</i>

10:47.040 --> 10:48.520
<i>If you walk using those arrows,</i>

10:48.520 --> 10:51.360
<i>you could stroll right into one of
those things and get swallowed alive.</i>

10:51.360 --> 10:52.760
- <i>Doctor.</i>
- <i>The truth.</i>

10:53.440 --> 10:55.800
- <i>Okay, but, Lindy, trust him.</i>

10:55.800 --> 10:59.120
<i>I learnt that a while back, and it's
saved my life so many times.</i>

10:59.120 --> 11:02.560
<i>Bubble down. Dot off. Walk out.</i>

11:02.560 --> 11:04.080
<i>You can do it.</i>

11:04.080 --> 11:06.120
<i>Bubble down.</i>

11:07.440 --> 11:08.720
Bubble, down.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.600
- Dot, off.

11:49.640 --> 11:51.760
- Oh, God. I'm so stupid!

11:53.600 --> 11:55.440
- D-D-Dot and Bubble.

11:55.440 --> 11:56.840
<i>Did you do it? Are you out?</i>

11:56.840 --> 11:58.560
- I don't know how to walk.
- <i>What do you mean?</i>

11:58.560 --> 12:00.360
I don't know how to walk
without the arrows.

12:00.360 --> 12:02.760
- <i>You don't know how to walk?</i>
- Without the arrows.

12:02.760 --> 12:04.520
<i>You don't know how to walk
without the arrows?</i>

12:04.520 --> 12:06.000
That's what I just said.

12:06.000 --> 12:09.160
Now shut up! I hate you!
I hate you! I hate you!

12:18.280 --> 12:19.280
Exit, please.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.640
<i>Forward.</i>

12:20.640 --> 12:22.000
<i>Turn right.</i>

12:22.000 --> 12:23.080
<i>Forward.</i>

12:23.080 --> 12:24.200
<i>Turn left.</i>

12:24.200 --> 12:25.280
<i>Forward.</i>

12:25.960 --> 12:26.960
<i>Forward.</i>

12:27.520 --> 12:31.680
<i>Forward.</i>

12:31.680 --> 12:32.760
<i>Turn left.</i>

12:33.440 --> 12:34.440
<i>Forward.</i>

12:35.440 --> 12:36.440
<i>Stop.</i>

12:39.080 --> 12:40.920
Elevator, down to ground floor.

12:42.280 --> 12:44.560
- You see? The arrows work.
- <i>Yeah, okay.</i>

12:44.560 --> 12:47.040
<i>That's good. You're amazing, Lindy.</i>

12:47.040 --> 12:50.360
<i>I swear to the sky,
you are doing really, really well.</i>

12:50.360 --> 12:51.840
Oh, condescending much?

12:51.840 --> 12:53.360
<i>Forward.</i>

12:53.360 --> 12:54.440
<i>Forward.</i>

12:56.360 --> 12:58.480
<i>Lindy, Lindy! Stop, stop! No.</i>
<i>Forward.</i>

12:58.480 --> 13:01.080
- <i>Run, run, run, run! No, no!</i>
<i>Forward.</i>

13:01.080 --> 13:02.520
<i>Not forward! Go back!</i>

13:02.520 --> 13:05.000
- <i>Move! Don't follow the arrows!</i>
- <i>Move. Move. Get outta the way!</i>

13:05.000 --> 13:06.680
- <i>It's right there.</i>
- <i>Do not follow the arrows.</i>

13:06.680 --> 13:08.160
- <i>Just keep going back!</i>
<i>Move back!</i>

13:08.160 --> 13:09.320
- <i>Back!</i>
- <i>Back, Lindy! Move back!</i>

13:09.320 --> 13:11.200
<i>Not forward! Not forward!</i>
<i>Forward.</i>

13:11.200 --> 13:12.560
<i>Back! Back!</i>
- <i>Move back!</i>

13:12.560 --> 13:14.520
- <i>The monster is in front of you.</i>
<i>Don't move.</i>

13:14.520 --> 13:15.600
- <i>No, no, no!</i>
<i>Forward.</i>

13:15.600 --> 13:17.760
<i>Do not follow the arrows!</i>
<i>No, no, no, no, no!</i>

13:17.760 --> 13:19.200
<i>Forward.</i>

13:19.200 --> 13:21.960
<i>Forward.</i>

13:21.960 --> 13:23.600
- <i>Forward.</i>

13:23.600 --> 13:25.520
- <i>It ignored you.</i>
<i>Forward.</i>

13:25.520 --> 13:27.400
<i>Why did it do that? What did you do?</i>

13:27.400 --> 13:30.000
<i>There's-- That's two of them now,
just letting you go.</i>

13:30.000 --> 13:31.080
<i>Lindy, get in the lift!</i>

13:31.080 --> 13:33.400
<i>Forward.</i>
<i>Yes. Yeah, yeah. Lift, lift.</i>

13:33.400 --> 13:35.080
<i>Forward.</i>

13:35.080 --> 13:36.440
<i>Stop and turn.</i>

13:36.440 --> 13:37.640
<i>Lindy.</i>

13:37.640 --> 13:40.400
<i>Lindy, just think.
Is there anything different about you?</i>

13:40.400 --> 13:43.360
<i>It might be, uh,
a perfume, or your blood type,</i>

13:43.360 --> 13:46.120
<i>or just something different
to Bertie Lester.</i>

13:46.120 --> 13:47.200
Police.

13:47.200 --> 13:50.360
<i>All lines are busy.
We regret we cannot help you at this time.</i>

13:50.360 --> 13:51.640
But I really need the police.

13:51.640 --> 13:54.960
<i>All lines are busy.
We regret we cannot help you at this time.</i>

13:54.960 --> 13:56.760
But I really need the police!

13:56.760 --> 13:58.480
There-There-There's a murder.

13:58.480 --> 14:00.280
There was a murder ten feet to my right.

14:00.280 --> 14:03.640
<i>All lines are busy.
We regret we cannot help you at this time.</i>

14:03.640 --> 14:05.360
Please, will someone help me?

14:05.360 --> 14:08.000
<i>That's why we're here,
and we're gonna get you out. I promise.</i>

14:10.520 --> 14:11.520
<i>Foyer.</i>

14:11.520 --> 14:13.880
<i>Careful. Careful. Careful.</i>

14:15.200 --> 14:16.680
What do I do now?

14:16.680 --> 14:18.200
<i>Let's go out to the street.</i>

14:18.200 --> 14:19.360
<i>Is that okay?</i>

14:19.360 --> 14:21.480
<i>One step at a time.</i>

14:21.480 --> 14:23.640
<i>Forward.</i>

14:23.640 --> 14:24.760
<i>Forward.</i>

14:25.760 --> 14:26.960
<i>Turn right.</i>

14:27.520 --> 14:28.680
<i>Forward.</i>

14:29.560 --> 14:31.160
<i>Turn left.</i>

14:32.320 --> 14:33.320
<i>Forward.</i>

14:34.440 --> 14:36.520
- <i>Forward.</i>

14:36.520 --> 14:38.800
- <i>Forward.</i>
<i>And could you stop there?</i>

14:38.800 --> 14:39.880
<i>Now, Lindy.</i>

14:39.880 --> 14:42.680
<i>I know that you don't like
lowering the Bubble, and I get that.</i>

14:42.680 --> 14:44.400
<i>I know. I understand.</i>

14:44.400 --> 14:47.920
<i>But we need to find out
what it's like outside-- full 360--</i>

14:47.920 --> 14:50.000
<i>and you're the only one who can tell us.</i>

14:50.000 --> 14:54.080
<i>Could you just lower the Bubble,
just for ten teeny-tiny seconds?</i>

14:54.080 --> 14:55.160
I'm not a child.

14:55.160 --> 14:56.520
<i>Uh, sorry, sorry!</i>

14:57.200 --> 14:58.720
<i>But could you, please?</i>

15:03.640 --> 15:05.520
- Bubble, down. Dot, off.

15:10.720 --> 15:13.360
Yeah, it's fine.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.000
- Hey! Be careful. Watch out!

15:20.840 --> 15:22.400
Help! Help me!

15:26.640 --> 15:27.960
Help! Help me!

15:27.960 --> 15:29.280
- Dot and Bubble.

15:30.360 --> 15:31.440
Hiding place, please.

15:31.440 --> 15:33.720
<i>Turn left. Turn left.</i>

15:33.720 --> 15:36.000
<i>Turn left. Turn left.</i>

15:39.840 --> 15:41.440
- <i>Hi there.</i>

15:41.440 --> 15:42.520
<i>Hello.</i>

15:44.440 --> 15:45.520
<i>Sorry.</i>

15:46.880 --> 15:47.960
<i>I know this is terrible.</i>

15:47.960 --> 15:51.200
<i>I really know. Believe me.
I've seen some things.</i>

15:51.200 --> 15:53.840
<i>But we just can't reach you, Lindy.</i>

15:53.840 --> 15:55.240
<i>We're trying but we can't.</i>

15:55.240 --> 15:57.680
<i>And we might not have much time.</i>

15:58.600 --> 16:01.400
<i>Can you tell us,
what is it like on the street?</i>

16:01.400 --> 16:02.680
<i>What did you see?</i>

16:02.680 --> 16:06.280
They're everywhere. Those things.

16:06.280 --> 16:10.200
But there was this one girl,
she walked right past, and it ignored her.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.840
But then this other girl,
she got eaten alive.

16:12.840 --> 16:14.000
<i>It's some of you.</i>

16:14.880 --> 16:17.080
<i>Some of you get eaten,
and some of you don't.</i>

16:18.360 --> 16:21.880
<i>Maybe it's your diet, or your height,
or something in your DNA.</i>

16:21.880 --> 16:23.880
<i>And why can't the Dot see those things?</i>

16:23.880 --> 16:26.080
- They must be from the Wild Woods.
- <i>What do you mean?</i>

16:26.080 --> 16:29.720
We're told, from day one,
"Never touch the Wild Woods."

16:30.320 --> 16:33.880
The whole of Finetime is surrounded
by this woodland-forest thing.

16:33.880 --> 16:35.560
It's, like, really natural.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.400
But we have force fields.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.480
We're shielded off.

16:38.480 --> 16:40.200
How did they get inside?

16:40.200 --> 16:42.480
<i>Your security is crazy tight.
It's blocked me.</i>

16:42.480 --> 16:43.920
<i>I'm stuck on the outside of the city.</i>

16:43.920 --> 16:46.880
<i>So how would
those great big bugs sneak in?</i>

16:46.880 --> 16:50.400
<i>Lindy, do you mind if I ask,
what is Finetime?</i>

16:50.400 --> 16:51.680
<i>How d-- How does it work?</i>

16:51.680 --> 16:53.280
Jiminy, you're stupid.

16:53.280 --> 16:55.000
We come here from the Homeworld.

16:55.000 --> 16:56.280
No stinky old folk.

16:56.280 --> 16:58.280
Just people ages 17 to 27.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.320
I mean, no. Not just anyone.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.720
If you can afford it, obviously.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.200
<i>Ah, so you're the rich kids?</i>

17:04.200 --> 17:05.760
Uh, I should hope so.

17:05.760 --> 17:08.000
<i>I thought you were, like, office drones,</i>

17:08.000 --> 17:10.320
<i>but that's why
you only work two hours a day.</i>

17:10.320 --> 17:12.240
<i>So the rest of the time--</i>

17:12.240 --> 17:13.400
We party.

17:13.400 --> 17:15.560
- <i>It's like</i> Love Island: The Planet<i>.</i>

17:15.560 --> 17:17.560
- Mummy paid for it all.

17:17.560 --> 17:20.280
<i>We miss you so much, darling.</i>

17:20.280 --> 17:23.640
<i>But I'd pay for the whole moon
to make you happy.</i>

17:24.400 --> 17:28.400
<i>Just look up at the sky,
and wave to us on the Homeworld.</i>

17:28.920 --> 17:30.680
<i>Happy Finetime, Lindy-Loo.</i>

17:31.280 --> 17:34.200
<i>And don't forget,
you're only a Bubble away.</i>

17:35.560 --> 17:36.560
<i>Who is that?</i>

17:36.560 --> 17:38.520
I told you. It's Mummy.

17:38.520 --> 17:39.960
<i>Hold on. I've seen her before.</i>

17:39.960 --> 17:43.160
<i>Yeah, she's like-- She's the face
of the ambulance on Kastarion 3.</i>

17:43.160 --> 17:45.000
<i>No, no, no. I've seen her somewhere else.</i>

17:45.920 --> 17:47.360
Are you two in the same room?

17:48.360 --> 17:49.440
- <i>No. No.</i>
- <i>No.</i>

17:49.440 --> 17:51.640
- <i>Uh, sorry. We'll save that for later.</i>

17:51.640 --> 17:54.600
You are. You're in the same room.
You're together.

17:54.600 --> 17:56.440
<i>Oh, what the hell. Yes.</i>

17:58.280 --> 18:00.720
- <i>Mm-hmm.</i>
You-- You lied to me.

18:00.720 --> 18:03.440
This is like a conspiracy. Who are you?

18:03.440 --> 18:05.000
<i>We're just trying to help.</i>

18:05.520 --> 18:08.080
You. I blocked you.

18:08.080 --> 18:10.400
Didn't I block you? I knew it. I did.

18:10.400 --> 18:13.480
I thought that you just looked the same,
but you're-- How did you do that?

18:13.480 --> 18:15.120
- <i>Unblocked, babes.</i>

18:15.120 --> 18:16.200
You can't unblock.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.960
There is no such thing as unblocking.
That's breaking all the rules.

18:18.960 --> 18:22.320
Oh, my hazy days.
Why am I even talking to you two?

18:22.320 --> 18:23.400
You're criminals.

18:23.400 --> 18:26.920
I-- I actually have proper friends.
Guys? Guys.

18:26.920 --> 18:30.120
Close Friends, Priority One.
Initiate group chat now!

18:30.120 --> 18:32.200
- <i>You did not just Priority One us.</i>
- <i>You can't Priority One.</i>

18:32.200 --> 18:34.320
- <i>Not funny. Seriously.</i>
- <i>You're gonna be disciplined for this.</i>

18:34.320 --> 18:37.040
<i>We could be given extra hours.</i>
<i>We need Priority One.</i>

18:37.040 --> 18:38.640
- <i>I'm so glad you did that, Lindy.</i>
- Mute!

18:39.280 --> 18:42.800
Guys, guys! Sorry not sorry,
but this is much more important.

18:42.800 --> 18:43.880
I have evidence.

18:43.880 --> 18:46.000
Just look at my Close Friends.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.440
Look how many are missing.

18:47.440 --> 18:49.320
Jimbo and Bobbie.

18:49.960 --> 18:52.560
Oh, my God. Where's Cooper Mercy?

18:52.560 --> 18:54.400
She-- She was here five minutes ago.

18:54.400 --> 18:57.080
Cooper? Can you hear me? Cooper Mercy?

18:58.600 --> 19:00.640
Cooper Mercy was my best friend.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.040
And-And Valerie? Ha-Has she gone?

19:03.040 --> 19:04.520
Calling Valerie Nook!

19:05.480 --> 19:07.280
Unmute Gothic Paul.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.600
<i>Guys, I've been trying to say,
people have been disappearing.</i>

19:10.600 --> 19:13.200
<i>Stewie Bloom,
when was the last time you saw him?</i>

19:13.200 --> 19:15.080
<i>Rooster Jacket? Joseph and Lucy.</i>

19:15.080 --> 19:17.160
<i>And I've not seen Kirstie Bookkeeper
since last week.</i>

19:17.160 --> 19:18.240
This is the weird thing.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.480
Some of us get eaten,
and some of us don't.

19:21.120 --> 19:23.560
- <i>I'm sorry. Some of us get what?</i>
- Eaten.

19:24.520 --> 19:25.520
<i>What do you mean, eaten?</i>

19:25.520 --> 19:26.720
Eaten alive!

19:26.720 --> 19:29.240
There are things out there,
in the real world,

19:29.240 --> 19:31.160
and I swear, they are eating us alive.

19:31.160 --> 19:34.600
<i>Oh, for land's sake, Lindy.
Don't be so silly.</i>

19:34.600 --> 19:36.640
<i>Not even I would say something like that.</i>

19:36.640 --> 19:38.400
<i>Just because someone goes off--</i>

19:39.920 --> 19:41.000
Mute!

19:41.000 --> 19:43.560
Oh, I'm sorry.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.560
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

19:48.080 --> 19:50.000
No, no, no, no, no.

19:50.840 --> 19:53.200
I told you! I told you!

19:53.200 --> 19:56.200
Why didn't you listen to me? I told you!

19:56.200 --> 19:57.680
<i>Lindy. Lindy, it's okay.</i>

19:57.680 --> 19:59.240
<i>I think that I can get you out.</i>

19:59.240 --> 20:01.400
- I muted you.
- <i>Unmuted, honey.</i>

20:01.400 --> 20:03.000
I was so right to hate you.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.840
<i>Okay,
but I need to talk to everyone.</i>

20:04.840 --> 20:07.160
- <i>Let me just-- Let me just squeeze in.</i>

20:07.160 --> 20:09.240
You can't do that.
- <i>Yeah, well, I just did.</i>

20:09.240 --> 20:11.760
<i>Okay, if you all could just listen...</i>

20:11.760 --> 20:15.040
Guys, I-- I know this is wrong,

20:15.040 --> 20:19.440
and when this is over, he is gonna be
so disciplined-- I can't wait--

20:19.440 --> 20:21.760
but just give him a shot, okay?

20:21.760 --> 20:24.800
- I think he's not as stupid as he looks.
<i>You don't have to like me.</i>

20:24.800 --> 20:28.240
<i>The only important thing
is to get you out, and I've found it.</i>

20:28.240 --> 20:30.040
<i>I've got access to the plans of the city.</i>

20:30.040 --> 20:33.160
<i>There is a river running underground,
underneath the town.</i>

20:33.160 --> 20:34.440
<i>If you can get to the river,</i>

20:34.440 --> 20:37.560
<i>there is help, there is safety,
there is an escape.</i>

20:37.560 --> 20:41.400
<i>Okay, there are conduits throughout
the city, like tunnels. Vertical tunnels.</i>

20:41.400 --> 20:44.600
<i>The river was generating electricity
back in the old days,</i>

20:44.600 --> 20:46.360
<i>and the conduits still stand.</i>

20:46.360 --> 20:48.880
- <i>I'm sending you all locations.</i>

20:48.880 --> 20:52.040
<i>You all live within a half a mile
of a conduit, so get there.</i>

20:52.040 --> 20:53.200
<i>The conduits are locked,</i>

20:53.200 --> 20:55.320
<i>so once you find them,
I can send you a code.</i>

20:55.320 --> 20:56.680
<i>But you've got to be careful</i>

20:56.680 --> 21:00.520
<i>because it means going out
onto the streets with those things.</i>

21:00.520 --> 21:02.440
I'm sorry, guys. It's true.

21:02.440 --> 21:06.000
<i>But we can't work out why they eat
some of you and not all of you.</i>

21:06.000 --> 21:08.720
<i>You lot, is there something
you've all got in common?</i>

21:08.720 --> 21:11.360
<i>Is there something you drink
that other people don't?</i>

21:11.360 --> 21:13.520
<i>Or something that you don't drink
that other people do?</i>

21:14.520 --> 21:16.840
<i>Or maybe something you touched
that Gothic Paul didn't? Or Cooper?</i>

21:16.840 --> 21:18.880
- <i>Why were they eaten?</i>
<i>Your power is low.</i>

21:18.880 --> 21:20.960
- Oh, no. No, no. Not now.
<i>Please charge your Dot.</i>

21:20.960 --> 21:22.920
<i>Lindy, what's happening?</i>
- I'm out of power.

21:22.920 --> 21:26.080
- <i>You are kidding me!</i>
- <i>You still have battery problems?</i>

21:26.080 --> 21:29.240
We charge up at work,
and you stopped me from working!

21:29.240 --> 21:30.880
You took me away from my desk!

21:30.880 --> 21:31.960
This is your fault!

21:31.960 --> 21:33.800
<i>Uh, okay. Everyone, everyone.</i>

21:33.800 --> 21:36.400
<i>Head to your conduits.
Follow my instructions.</i>

21:36.400 --> 21:38.080
<i>Go! Now!</i>

21:38.080 --> 21:39.320
<i>Lindy, listen to me.</i>

21:39.320 --> 21:41.480
<i>Your conduit has an access point
on Plaza 55.</i>

21:41.480 --> 21:44.640
<i>It's inside building number 7-- Z.</i>

21:44.640 --> 21:46.480
What? Building number what?

21:46.480 --> 21:48.120
Which way? Which way do I go?

21:48.120 --> 21:51.120
Which plaza?
What-What-What was it? Fifty-five?

21:51.120 --> 21:53.160
Wh-Wh-Wh-Where do I go? What?

21:53.160 --> 21:56.200
Oh, G-- Oh, come on, Lindy. Okay.

21:57.480 --> 22:00.920
Okay. Come on, Lindy. It's this way.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.480
Yes. No. Yes.

22:06.760 --> 22:07.760
Forward.

22:08.280 --> 22:09.680
Forward.

22:09.680 --> 22:10.960
F--

22:13.800 --> 22:15.400
Lindy!

22:17.120 --> 22:18.240
Forward.

22:41.040 --> 22:46.640
Plaza 55 is forward.

22:48.560 --> 22:49.560
Forward.

22:52.200 --> 22:53.720
Oh. No, no, no, no!

22:59.800 --> 23:00.800
Forward.

23:02.920 --> 23:04.080
Forward.

23:06.680 --> 23:08.000
No, no, no, no!

23:08.000 --> 23:09.840
Oh, God!

23:09.840 --> 23:12.520
I'm so stupid!

23:13.520 --> 23:15.280
Turn left.
Take two steps forward.

23:15.280 --> 23:16.400
Wh-What?

23:16.400 --> 23:18.960
Turn left.
Take two steps forward.

23:18.960 --> 23:20.480
Who's that?

23:21.560 --> 23:22.880
Just follow my voice.

23:22.880 --> 23:26.440
Turn left,
and then take two steps forward.

23:33.760 --> 23:35.720
Stop! Turn right.

23:40.240 --> 23:42.960
Is this for real?

23:42.960 --> 23:44.640
I know. It's me.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.160
Just listen to my voice.

23:46.160 --> 23:48.600
All you have to do is walk forward.
Use me like the arrows.

23:48.600 --> 23:49.800
But--

23:49.800 --> 23:51.840
I'm not on-screen. I'm over here.

23:51.840 --> 23:54.080
But you look like Ricky September.

23:54.600 --> 23:55.600
I am Ricky September.

23:55.600 --> 23:56.960
Oh, my gosh.

23:56.960 --> 23:59.640
But we do need to get out.
This whole city's going mad.

23:59.640 --> 24:01.640
You just have to do what I say,
and walk forwards.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.440
- What's your name?
- Lindy Pepper-Bean.

24:03.440 --> 24:05.320
- You're one of my followers.
- How do you know that?

24:05.320 --> 24:07.680
Well, okay. Everybody is.

24:08.200 --> 24:09.400
Follow my voice.

24:10.600 --> 24:11.760
Walk forward.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.080
Forward.

24:19.680 --> 24:20.800
Forward.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.080
Forward.

24:25.840 --> 24:28.600
Forward.

24:29.280 --> 24:31.000
- Forward.

24:33.880 --> 24:34.960
Forward.

24:36.440 --> 24:37.520
Forward.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.440
Forward. That's it. That's it.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.800
- Well done, Lindy. You did it.
- Sorry.

24:45.800 --> 24:46.880
I'm sorry.

24:46.880 --> 24:49.000
Just-- That's the first time
I've ever done that.

24:49.000 --> 24:51.280
Oh, no. Well, it's not every day
we walk past monsters.

24:51.280 --> 24:52.840
No, I mean the hug.

24:52.840 --> 24:54.320
- That was your first hug?
- Yeah.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.920
- I'm so sorry. I should have asked.
- No!

24:56.920 --> 24:59.360
No, I made you. It was my fault.
I shouldn't have.

24:59.360 --> 25:00.440
Uh, it was nice.

25:01.160 --> 25:02.200
It was great.

25:02.200 --> 25:03.560
You're Ricky September.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.560
Yep, every day.
But we do have to get moving.

25:05.560 --> 25:08.200
I tried to warn people in my videos,
but they kept getting deleted.

25:08.200 --> 25:11.040
'Cause it's weird, these things,
they eat some people but not everyone,

25:11.040 --> 25:13.680
and I can't help but think
that they're saving us till last.

25:13.680 --> 25:17.280
I know, but there's this conduit,
like, an escape.

25:17.280 --> 25:20.240
It's like a--
like a tunnel sort of thing on Plaza 55.

25:20.240 --> 25:21.720
Building number 7Z2.

25:21.720 --> 25:23.040
No way. How did you know that?

25:23.040 --> 25:24.520
Come on. It's almost night cycle.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.600
We've got about ten minutes
till the sun clicks off.

25:26.600 --> 25:28.880
- Oh. Is that okay?
- It's fine.

25:33.120 --> 25:34.920
You're so good at walking.

25:36.520 --> 25:40.000
Don't tell anyone, but I open the Bubble,
drop my songs and then...

25:41.560 --> 25:43.680
I turn the Dot off
for the rest of the day.

25:43.680 --> 25:46.280
Oh, my eyes. You're wild.
- I know.

25:46.800 --> 25:51.080
I just stay in my apartment and read.
That kind of thing.

25:51.600 --> 25:53.480
Oh, you're crazy.

25:53.480 --> 25:55.480
That's how I know about the conduits.

25:55.480 --> 25:57.240
I read, like, um, history.

25:57.240 --> 26:01.080
And during the Great Abrogation,
this whole city was sealed off,

26:01.080 --> 26:04.280
but there's a river running underground,
underneath the city, and I think--

26:05.440 --> 26:08.320
Whoa, whoa.
Um, don't look at that.

26:08.320 --> 26:09.960
Look at me. Look at me.

26:09.960 --> 26:12.800
- Don't look at that. Look at me.

26:12.800 --> 26:16.880
Lindy Pepper-Bean,
I will get you out of here. I promise.

26:17.640 --> 26:20.040
I thought this was
the worst day of my life,

26:20.040 --> 26:21.720
but maybe it's the best.

26:22.880 --> 26:25.120
There's still thousands of people
being eaten alive.

26:25.120 --> 26:26.200
Yeah, but--

26:39.800 --> 26:41.680
Oh! I can charge up. Yahoo.

26:41.680 --> 26:44.120
Yes, and they've got
a planet-link. I can call the Homeworld.

26:44.120 --> 26:46.200
- Do you think they can help us?
- Oh, it's gonna be massive.

26:46.200 --> 26:47.280
Up there, in the sky,

26:47.280 --> 26:49.720
is a planet full of our mums and dads,
and they're gonna be so cross.

26:49.720 --> 26:51.080
They're gonna be righteous,

26:51.080 --> 26:54.280
and they'll come down here
with rocket ships and flamethrowers

26:54.280 --> 26:55.760
and weedkillers.

26:57.920 --> 27:01.160
There was this man,
and he said there was a code.

27:01.680 --> 27:04.160
He was horrible. He was so rude.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.440
- He said the conduit has a code.
Yeah?

27:08.440 --> 27:10.920
Did you get through?
What are they saying?

27:10.920 --> 27:12.280
Can I speak to Mummy?

27:12.800 --> 27:14.440
Link's busy.

27:14.440 --> 27:16.960
They're probably getting
millions of calls, but they're coming.

27:16.960 --> 27:18.040
They're on their way.

27:18.040 --> 27:20.000
Just might, you know, take a little while.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.600
And we need to find that conduit.

27:21.600 --> 27:22.840
We can sit and wait.

27:22.840 --> 27:24.320
We'll be safe.

27:24.320 --> 27:25.400
<i>Completed.</i>

27:25.400 --> 27:26.720
Okay. Charged up.

27:27.360 --> 27:30.040
- Sixty seconds till night cycle.

27:30.040 --> 27:32.040
- Come on.
- Let's go.

27:42.920 --> 27:43.920
This way!

27:44.440 --> 27:45.440
Oh, mind your head!

27:46.800 --> 27:47.920
Down here!

27:55.320 --> 27:56.520
Yeah, this way.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.600
Oh, my gosh.

28:04.360 --> 28:06.920
This is so manual.

28:06.920 --> 28:10.320
Yeah, people used to work like this,
back in the old days.

28:10.840 --> 28:12.040
Got paid in money.

28:12.920 --> 28:13.920
I've read about it.

28:14.640 --> 28:15.880
That life was tough.

28:15.880 --> 28:18.320
My job's not easy. I get chapping.

28:18.320 --> 28:19.600
Hey! I think this is it.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.760
This is the conduit to the river.

28:21.760 --> 28:23.840
- And you've got the code?
- Yes, I certainly have.

28:23.840 --> 28:25.080
- Dot and Bubble.

28:25.080 --> 28:28.200
<i>Lindy! You are still with us.</i>
<i>You're alive! That's brilliant.</i>

28:28.200 --> 28:31.520
Don't be so surprised.
I found it. I'm at the conduit.

28:31.520 --> 28:32.800
But guess what.

28:32.800 --> 28:34.240
I'm with Ricky September.

28:34.240 --> 28:37.000
<i>What? Ricky the singer?</i>
- That's him.

28:37.000 --> 28:38.960
- <i>Oh, nice one.</i>
- <i>He is hot.</i>

28:38.960 --> 28:40.040
<i>Hands off!</i>

28:40.040 --> 28:43.560
Yo. Hi. Hi, guys. Um, yeah, the code?
So we can get out of here.

28:43.560 --> 28:45.400
<i>Sorry. Yeah. Hi, Ricky. Wow.</i>

28:45.400 --> 28:47.040
- Hi.
<i>Uh--</i>

28:47.040 --> 28:48.600
<i>So, uh, that door is mono-sealed,</i>

28:48.600 --> 28:50.640
<i>'cause they closed it off
when they disinfected the city.</i>

28:50.640 --> 28:53.440
<i>I can send you
the pulse numbers one at a time.</i>

28:53.440 --> 28:55.040
<i>You get the numbers for five seconds.</i>

28:55.040 --> 28:58.280
<i>Type it in like a combination,
but you've gotta be fast. Eh?</i>

28:58.280 --> 28:59.240
<i>Don't miss a number.</i>

28:59.240 --> 29:01.960
<i>They only stay live for five seconds,
and there's a hundred numbers in total.</i>

29:01.960 --> 29:03.240
Yeah, it's okay. You don't--

29:03.240 --> 29:06.560
I've studied pulse codes,
so I kind of know how they work.

29:06.560 --> 29:08.080
<i>Oh, you're clever as well.</i>

29:09.080 --> 29:10.520
- <i>Okay, heart-stopper.</i>

29:10.520 --> 29:12.760
- <i>Uh, sending you the numbers now.</i>

29:18.320 --> 29:20.040
<i>Thirty-three.</i>

29:20.040 --> 29:22.640
- My friends, are they still alive?
<i>Forty-five.</i>

29:22.640 --> 29:26.480
<i>They are, but--
I'm sorry. They're still at their desks.</i>

29:26.480 --> 29:29.720
I told them,
and they all saw Gothic Paul being eaten.

29:29.720 --> 29:32.280
<i>One of them went on the run.
The one with the trumpet?</i>

29:32.280 --> 29:33.920
- Hoochy Pie.
<i>Hoochy Pie!</i>

29:33.920 --> 29:36.000
<i>We lost her signal,
but she's still running.</i>

29:36.000 --> 29:39.240
<i>Good thing is,
none of them have been eaten so far.</i>

29:40.000 --> 29:41.720
- <i>Why?</i>
- Well, Ricky says--

29:41.720 --> 29:43.440
my friend Ricky September--

29:43.440 --> 29:45.520
he says they're saving us to eat last.

29:45.520 --> 29:47.160
Maybe we're the most tasty.

29:47.160 --> 29:49.240
- Well, Ricky is.
- Steady.

29:49.760 --> 29:53.720
<i>If only it was that simple.
That would imply that they've got a list.</i>

29:54.640 --> 29:56.520
- <i>No.</i>
<i>Zero, two.</i>

29:57.120 --> 29:58.120
<i>No.</i>

29:59.520 --> 30:01.280
- <i>Wait a minute.</i>
- <i>What is it?</i>

30:01.280 --> 30:02.760
- <i>No, can't be.</i>
- What?

30:02.760 --> 30:04.480
<i>No way. No. No, no, no, no.</i>

30:04.480 --> 30:06.640
<i>Oh, no, no, no, no, no.</i>

30:06.640 --> 30:08.160
- <i>Doctor, stop it. Tell us.</i>
- <i>No. No.</i>

30:08.160 --> 30:10.120
<i>Lindy. Lindy, your friend Gothic Paul.</i>

30:10.120 --> 30:12.720
<i>Is he a Paul who's gothic,
or is Paul his surname?</i>

30:12.720 --> 30:14.520
It's his surname. Alexander Paul.

30:14.520 --> 30:16.000
Gothic's just a nickname.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.360
- <i>Which means-- No, no, no, no, no, no.</i>
<i>Thirty-three.</i>

30:19.920 --> 30:20.920
<i>Really?</i>

30:21.520 --> 30:23.800
<i>Gothic Paul got eaten.
Before that, Valerie Nook.</i>

30:23.800 --> 30:26.920
<i>Before that, Cooper Mercy.
Before that, Bertie Lester.</i>

30:26.920 --> 30:28.520
<i>Don't you see? It's--</i>

30:28.520 --> 30:31.160
<i>It's been a week since anyone
has heard from Kirstie Bookkeeper.</i>

30:31.160 --> 30:32.840
<i>No, it can't be!</i>

30:32.840 --> 30:34.400
I don't understand.

30:34.400 --> 30:35.800
<i>Fifty-six.</i>

30:35.800 --> 30:38.600
Oh, my poor friends.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.360
<i>Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But look.</i>

30:42.000 --> 30:43.400
Yeah, what's the difference?

30:44.000 --> 30:45.840
<i>Those are the names in alphabetical order.</i>

30:45.840 --> 30:48.360
- So?
- <i>They are in alphabetical order.</i>

30:48.360 --> 30:50.200
Yes, I can see that. So?

30:50.200 --> 30:51.400
<i>Ninety-eight.</i>

30:51.400 --> 30:54.080
<i>They died in alphabetical order.</i>

30:54.080 --> 30:55.320
I don't understand.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.600
<i>It was right in front of me!</i>

30:57.600 --> 31:01.440
<i>Those things are eating people in
alphabetical order right across the city.</i>

31:01.440 --> 31:02.920
But that's impossible.

31:02.920 --> 31:05.640
<i>Lindy, your surname, Pepper-Bean.
Is that P for Pepper or B for Bean?</i>

31:05.640 --> 31:09.200
It's P for Pepper, which comes after
Gothic Paul, but I'm still alive.

31:09.200 --> 31:12.120
We ran past those things outside,
and they didn't even look at me.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.800
<i>Yeah, there's a lot of people
beginning with P.</i>

31:13.800 --> 31:16.840
<i>Maybe they're still eating the ones
that came before you.</i>

31:16.840 --> 31:18.360
<i>One, eight.</i>

31:18.360 --> 31:19.960
<i>All the Pauls have gone.</i>

31:19.960 --> 31:22.480
- <i>Alison Partner, dead.</i>
<i>Sixty-four.</i>

31:22.480 --> 31:25.360
<i>Pattersons. There are 25 Pattersons.
All of them dead.</i>

31:25.360 --> 31:27.720
<i>Pavilions, dead. Pavings, dead.</i>

31:27.720 --> 31:28.800
Oh, my God.

31:30.120 --> 31:31.880
It's working its way towards me.

31:31.880 --> 31:34.040
<i>Peach, dead.</i>

31:34.040 --> 31:36.760
<i>Pebble, dead. Pelican, dead.</i>

31:36.760 --> 31:40.440
<i>Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait.
There's someone-- Suzie Pentecost.</i>

31:40.440 --> 31:42.000
<i>She's still here-- Here she is!</i>

31:42.000 --> 31:45.840
<i>Oh, hi there, Lindy.
You look like fun. Hello! Happy day!</i>

31:45.840 --> 31:47.200
Hi, Suzie.

31:47.200 --> 31:50.840
<i>I guess I need some new friends.
It's all gone so quiet out there.</i>

31:50.840 --> 31:52.800
<i>Have they declared a holiday or something?</i>

31:52.800 --> 31:54.720
<i>But it's really, really nice to meet you!</i>

31:54.720 --> 31:58.000
<i>You are so pretty--</i>

32:00.400 --> 32:02.360
But I'm next! Pepper's next!

32:02.360 --> 32:04.920
- <i>Hurry up with those numbers.</i>
- I get eaten next!

32:04.920 --> 32:07.520
Oh, my God. It's me.
They're coming for me!

32:07.520 --> 32:10.560
- Okay, ha-- hang on. Listen!
They're going to eat me!

32:10.560 --> 32:12.120
- Lindy!

32:12.120 --> 32:14.560
No, they're not. Listen to me.

32:16.600 --> 32:19.560
You might be next, but we're safe.
In this room.

32:19.560 --> 32:21.920
<i>Forty-five.</i>

32:22.880 --> 32:24.640
Those things, they aren't down here.

32:24.640 --> 32:26.920
And even if they do chase after you,
they're slow.

32:27.760 --> 32:31.480
And all I've gotta do is punch in
30 more numbers into this keypad,

32:31.480 --> 32:32.600
and then we're gone.

32:34.760 --> 32:35.840
I've got this.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.360
Lindy, I'm getting you out of here.

32:39.880 --> 32:42.040
<i>Sixty-five.</i>
- Oh, Ricky, babes.

32:42.040 --> 32:43.320
<i>Oh, he's a keeper.</i>

32:48.200 --> 32:51.280
Oh, my hopscotch. That's a relief.

32:51.280 --> 32:54.560
I just-- I keep getting lucky, don't I?

32:54.560 --> 32:57.400
<i>Except... I hate to say this...</i>
<i>Ninety-eight.</i>

32:57.400 --> 32:59.520
<i>...but if those things
are eating in alphabetical order,</i>

32:59.520 --> 33:02.400
<i>they're not bugs from the outside.
They have been created.</i>

33:03.440 --> 33:04.880
<i>They're grown. They are designed.</i>

33:04.880 --> 33:07.480
<i>And I keep saying
why can't the Dot see them?</i>

33:08.440 --> 33:10.280
- And?
<i>Well, what if it can?</i>

33:10.280 --> 33:12.520
<i>What if it wants you
to walk right into them?</i>

33:12.520 --> 33:13.760
Why would it do that?

33:13.760 --> 33:16.560
<i>Imagine. If that Dot
has achieved sentience,</i>

33:17.320 --> 33:20.760
<i>and then it has to spend all day hovering
and listening to you lot chattering away.</i>

33:20.760 --> 33:23.880
<i>I'm--</i> [chuckles] <i>I'm not being rude,
but I think it's learnt to hate you.</i>

33:23.880 --> 33:25.960
<i>Sixty-four.</i>
- <i>Lindy, turn off your Dot.</i>

33:25.960 --> 33:28.120
- But it's just a Dot.
<i>Turn it off right now.</i>

33:28.120 --> 33:31.400
<i>That is a powerful
antigrav psycho-combination device.</i>

33:31.400 --> 33:33.720
<i>If it wants you dead,
it can kill you itself.</i>

33:33.720 --> 33:36.640
<i>Dot off! Dot off! Dot off.</i>
- <i>Dot off! Dot off! Dot off!</i>

33:36.640 --> 33:38.160
Bubble, down. Dot, off.

33:39.480 --> 33:41.000
I said, Dot, off!

33:41.000 --> 33:42.280
Lindy, what's it doing?

33:42.280 --> 33:44.680
- Y-You-You will obey me! Dot, off!

33:52.760 --> 33:54.720
- Lindy, do the numbers!

33:54.720 --> 33:56.680
- Come here! Take my place!

33:57.560 --> 33:59.840
- Lindy, come here and do the numbers!

33:59.840 --> 34:02.160
Help me!

34:03.120 --> 34:04.680
<i>Zero, four.</i>

34:05.760 --> 34:07.800
<i>Seventy-three.</i>

34:07.800 --> 34:10.160
Okay. Every five seconds, a new number.

34:11.040 --> 34:12.360
<i>Forty-five.</i>

34:15.520 --> 34:17.040
<i>Fifty-seven.</i>

34:18.080 --> 34:20.120
- I'll fight it off. Do the numbers.

34:21.080 --> 34:22.440
<i>Fifty-six.</i>

34:23.000 --> 34:24.480
Come on.

34:25.880 --> 34:27.440
<i>Seventy.</i>

34:29.400 --> 34:30.520
Come on.

34:30.520 --> 34:32.040
<i>Forty-five.</i>

34:34.440 --> 34:36.560
<i>Twenty-one.</i>

34:36.560 --> 34:37.720
- <i>Access granted.</i>
- I've got it!

34:37.720 --> 34:39.520
Go through! Don't worry about me!

34:48.840 --> 34:50.280
Lindy.

34:50.280 --> 34:51.520
- Watch out.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.160
His surname is Coombes!

34:56.800 --> 34:59.960
He was born Richard Coombes.
'Cause I know everything about him.

34:59.960 --> 35:03.240
He changed his name to Ricky September
when he reached 50,000 followers, but--

35:03.240 --> 35:05.680
Ch-Check your files! He was born Coombes.

35:05.680 --> 35:07.840
C comes before P!

35:09.800 --> 35:10.880
Lindy.

35:49.560 --> 35:52.560
Everyone make sure they have
their provisions for the journey

35:52.560 --> 35:53.720
before we depart.

36:16.520 --> 36:18.320
- Hoochy Pie!
- Whoo-hoo!

36:18.320 --> 36:21.640
- Blazing days, sweetie!
- Um.

36:21.640 --> 36:23.960
Oh! Is that what we do now?

36:23.960 --> 36:25.280
We do. We hug.

36:25.280 --> 36:28.120
I was taught that
by a very wonderful man.

36:28.120 --> 36:29.280
Aw.

36:30.760 --> 36:33.640
Hey, uh, where's Ricky? Is he with ya?

36:39.800 --> 36:40.800
He went back.

36:41.600 --> 36:44.000
He said he had other people to save.

36:44.000 --> 36:45.200
I couldn't stop him.

36:46.160 --> 36:48.960
He was so brave.

36:48.960 --> 36:51.360
And--

36:51.360 --> 36:53.960
Well, gosh.

36:54.640 --> 36:56.960
You two. This is strange.

36:58.640 --> 37:01.720
Suppose I should say thank you.

37:03.440 --> 37:04.680
It's okay.

37:04.680 --> 37:06.040
No need.

37:06.040 --> 37:09.840
It was, um, nice of you.

37:11.600 --> 37:13.280
You got here just in time.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.560
We're going, Lindy. We're leaving.

37:16.560 --> 37:18.560
- Going where?
Outside.

37:19.200 --> 37:22.240
The Great Beyond.
The world outside Finetime.

37:22.840 --> 37:25.120
You must be Lindy Pepper-Bean.
I've heard a lot about you.

37:25.120 --> 37:26.480
Mmm.

37:26.480 --> 37:28.800
Brewster Cavendish.
We haven't got titles yet,

37:28.800 --> 37:32.120
but if the role of leader is up for grabs,
I guess I'd put myself forward.

37:32.120 --> 37:34.920
- What do you mean, the Great Beyond?
The Wild Woods.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.880
And further than that.
The river leads down to the sea.

37:37.880 --> 37:40.280
And there's a whole world out there.
Untamed.

37:40.280 --> 37:43.280
But I thought the Homeworld
would just come and save us.

37:44.680 --> 37:46.080
That may take a while, hon.

37:46.080 --> 37:48.840
They're not coming, Lindy.
There's only us.

37:50.600 --> 37:52.200
But what about Mummy?

37:55.600 --> 37:57.080
She's not there, darling pie.

37:59.920 --> 38:01.000
You mean she--

38:01.880 --> 38:04.200
She's gone? To the sky?

38:05.400 --> 38:06.400
That's right.

38:11.800 --> 38:15.160
- Well, lucky Mummy. That's so lucky.
That's what I said.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.080
And we can go out there
to this planet.

38:17.080 --> 38:19.920
And we can fight it
and tame it and own it.

38:19.920 --> 38:21.640
- We'll be pioneers.

38:21.640 --> 38:23.680
- Just like our ancestors.

38:23.680 --> 38:26.960
Or... you could come with us.

38:30.640 --> 38:31.640
We could what?

38:32.320 --> 38:33.360
Come with us.

38:34.160 --> 38:36.880
- Yeah. We helped you escape, didn't we?

38:36.880 --> 38:39.200
So we could get you out of here.

38:39.200 --> 38:41.280
In the blink of an eye.

38:41.880 --> 38:43.440
I have a ship.

38:43.960 --> 38:46.880
It's called the TARDIS. That blue box.

38:47.840 --> 38:51.360
It harnesses technology that makes it
bigger on the inside than on the outside.

38:51.360 --> 38:53.240
I could take you all.

38:53.240 --> 38:55.400
Yeah, I could carry you to the stars.

38:55.400 --> 38:59.280
I...
...could find you a home that is safe

38:59.280 --> 39:02.520
and clean and everything you want.

39:03.600 --> 39:06.680
But is it-- We couldn't travel with you.

39:09.000 --> 39:10.280
What? Why not?

39:11.240 --> 39:14.080
Because you, sir, are not one of us.

39:14.080 --> 39:16.360
I mean, s-- You were kind.

39:16.360 --> 39:18.880
Although it was your duty to save me.
Obviously.

39:18.880 --> 39:24.000
I mean screen-to-screen contact is
just about acceptable, but in person?

39:25.440 --> 39:26.560
That's impossible.

39:26.560 --> 39:29.040
Like, you have a magic box?

39:29.040 --> 39:31.360
- Seriously?
- Bigger on the inside?

39:31.360 --> 39:33.320
Excuse me, sir.

39:33.320 --> 39:34.760
That's voodoo.

39:34.760 --> 39:37.480
And it doesn't matter
where we end up living.

39:37.480 --> 39:41.480
Because it is our God-given duty
to maintain the standards of Finetime.

39:41.480 --> 39:42.560
Forever.

39:44.280 --> 39:45.640
Now, thank you.

39:46.360 --> 39:48.120
And goodbye.

39:48.800 --> 39:50.880
Ugh, I can't even--

39:50.880 --> 39:54.520
I don't care what you think.

39:55.520 --> 39:58.200
Okay? You can say whatever you want.

39:58.720 --> 40:02.360
You can think...
...absolutely anything.

40:05.480 --> 40:08.680
I will do anything...

40:12.120 --> 40:14.000
if you just allow me

40:15.640 --> 40:17.920
to save your lives.

40:21.000 --> 40:23.920
If you'll turn away, ladies.
Before you're contaminated.

40:27.680 --> 40:29.360
Look, you will die!

40:30.920 --> 40:35.080
Out there! And I can save your lives!

40:38.000 --> 40:39.080
Now let me!

42:32.080 --> 42:35.080
<i>Oh, this is so</i> Bridgerton<i>.</i>
<i>Lord Barton approaches.</i>

42:35.080 --> 42:37.240
<i>Ooh,
that's a tall glass of heartbreak.</i>

42:37.240 --> 42:39.400
<i>There's a Chuldur
at work on this planet,</i>

42:39.400 --> 42:41.160
<i>and I've been paid good money to find you.</i>

42:41.160 --> 42:45.840
What could be better than a wedding?
