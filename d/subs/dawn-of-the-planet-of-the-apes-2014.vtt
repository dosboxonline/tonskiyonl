00:58.600 --> 01:02.440
If you have a fever and cough
or sore throat...

01:02.479 --> 01:04.059
Stay home.

01:04.105 --> 01:07.276
I'd say 95% chance this is manufactured.
Came out of a laboratory.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.147
The source of the virus was traced back...

01:09.194 --> 01:12.614
To drug testing done at
gen-sys laboratories in San Francisco.

01:12.656 --> 01:14.986
The lab technician now known
as patient zero...

01:15.033 --> 01:18.913
Was accidentally exposed to
retrovirus alz-113....

01:18.954 --> 01:21.794
An Alzheimer's trial drug
that was being tested on chimpanzees.

01:21.832 --> 01:25.132
The infected chimps showed signs
of erratic and aggressive behavior...

01:25.169 --> 01:27.089
That led to their escape from the facility.

01:27.129 --> 01:29.459
The now-famous incident
on the golden gate bridge...

01:29.506 --> 01:31.506
A six-hour standoff with police...

01:31.550 --> 01:34.180
Ended with the apes disappearing
into muir woods.

01:34.219 --> 01:37.929
Emergency rooms are being overwhelmed
with patients showing signs...

01:37.973 --> 01:39.853
Of what's being dubbed
"the simian flu."

01:39.892 --> 01:42.192
The CDC is projecting a fatality toll...

01:42.227 --> 01:45.687
Ranging from 5 million
to as many as 150 million...

01:45.731 --> 01:47.111
In the next 6 to 8 months.

01:47.149 --> 01:51.649
Anyone showing signs of a contagious illness
will receive special treatment here...

01:51.695 --> 01:54.275
The airport's purpose-built
quarantine center.

01:54.323 --> 01:58.373
Many of the new arrivals are children
who have lost contact with their parents.

01:58.410 --> 02:01.000
The mandatory quarantines
have sparked civil unrest.

02:01.038 --> 02:03.038
Families are being ripped apart.

02:03.081 --> 02:04.711
Containment is not very likely.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.500
Prepare your families.
Know your evacuation route.

02:07.544 --> 02:11.054
The survival rate is now
approximately 1 in 500.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.299
Violence erupted in the
city center tonight.

02:13.342 --> 02:14.802
The third incident in as many days.

02:14.843 --> 02:17.353
Martial law has been
declared in 28 nations...

02:17.387 --> 02:19.217
Including the U.S. and Canada.

02:19.264 --> 02:21.774
The reactor is overheating.
We can't stop a meltdown.

02:22.559 --> 02:26.899
Just a total collapse of anything
resembling civilian order.

02:26.939 --> 02:29.519
Due to the extremity of the
simian flu crisis...

02:29.566 --> 02:33.276
All regular government functions
have been suspended indefinitely.

02:35.405 --> 02:38.575
Those who aren't killed by the virus...

02:38.617 --> 02:40.447
Will probably die in the fighting.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.828
So, maybe this is it.

02:44.873 --> 02:47.043
This is how it ends.

02:47.084 --> 02:48.594
Pretty soon...

02:49.795 --> 02:51.765
There won't be anyone left.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.534
Caesar...

03:58.822 --> 04:00.202
They are close.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.738
Koba!

04:24.806 --> 04:26.846
Now, father?

05:30.205 --> 05:32.915
Son, stay...

06:49.743 --> 06:52.003
Thank you, koba.

07:13.851 --> 07:16.691
Think before you act, son.

08:21.251 --> 08:23.291
Don't feel bad, blue eyes...

08:26.715 --> 08:29.755
Scars make you strong.

10:46.730 --> 10:49.860
Come meet your new brother.

11:05.874 --> 11:07.254
Another son.

11:11.797 --> 11:15.927
Makes me think how far we've come,
Maurice.

11:18.971 --> 11:22.931
Seems long ago.

11:26.520 --> 11:29.150
Still think about them?

11:30.023 --> 11:31.613
Humans?

11:34.528 --> 11:36.028
Sometimes.

11:39.074 --> 11:41.794
Didn't know them like you did.

11:42.953 --> 11:46.373
Only saw their bad side.

11:47.082 --> 11:51.132
Good, bad... doesn't matter now.

11:52.754 --> 11:54.964
Humans destroyed each other.

11:55.883 --> 11:57.843
Apes fight too.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.795
But we are family.

12:07.102 --> 12:10.902
Wonder if they're really all gone.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.443
Ten winters now...

12:13.483 --> 12:17.153
Last two... no sign of them.

12:18.197 --> 12:20.157
They must be gone.

12:52.022 --> 12:54.902
That bear wouldn't get me blue eyes.
I'm quick!

12:55.317 --> 12:57.107
Shut up, ash!

13:08.455 --> 13:09.575
Oh, God.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.463
It's okay.

13:22.553 --> 13:25.183
It's okay. It's okay.

13:25.722 --> 13:26.722
Freeze!

13:41.738 --> 13:42.858
Stay!

13:42.906 --> 13:44.156
Help!

13:44.825 --> 13:46.455
Help!

13:46.493 --> 13:47.493
No!

13:48.412 --> 13:49.832
Hey!

13:50.914 --> 13:52.424
Over here!

13:54.418 --> 13:57.248
I shot him! I shot him.

14:29.036 --> 14:31.956
They shot ash! Shot my son!

14:32.789 --> 14:35.129
Rocket, wait...

14:41.089 --> 14:43.219
We don't mean any harm!

14:43.258 --> 14:47.138
They're apes, man. You think
they understand what you're saying?

14:48.388 --> 14:50.138
Do they look like just apes to you?

15:03.820 --> 15:04.820
Dad.

15:04.821 --> 15:05.781
Malcolm, what are you doing?

15:05.822 --> 15:07.202
- Dad?
- Malcolm.

15:07.241 --> 15:08.321
It's okay.

15:13.664 --> 15:15.464
Put your guns down.

15:15.499 --> 15:17.329
- You can't be serious.
- Do it.

15:26.927 --> 15:28.177
Go!

15:30.138 --> 15:31.218
Holy shit.

15:31.265 --> 15:32.275
Holy shit.

15:34.852 --> 15:37.482
Okay. Okay, we're going.

15:37.521 --> 15:38.981
Go!

15:39.022 --> 15:40.652
Slowly.
Go, go, go!

15:44.862 --> 15:46.242
My bag!

15:46.280 --> 15:47.280
Go!

16:07.968 --> 16:09.138
Koba!

16:11.096 --> 16:12.306
Follow!

16:58.101 --> 16:59.311
Did you find it?

17:00.187 --> 17:01.767
We need to talk.

17:02.022 --> 17:04.821
What? What's wrong?

17:06.777 --> 17:08.237
The dam is pretty much intact.

17:08.278 --> 17:10.198
It could probably start generating
power for us within a week.

17:10.696 --> 17:12.777
But there is a problem. Get in.

17:24.377 --> 17:25.548
I shot him.

17:26.171 --> 17:27.691
I was scared.
I didn't know what to do.

17:27.714 --> 17:30.844
Jesus Christ.
How many were there?

17:30.884 --> 17:32.094
A lot. Like, 80.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.425
- At least.
- Okay...

17:33.470 --> 17:37.350
You're not hearing what he's saying.
They spoke!

17:37.391 --> 17:38.931
That is not possible.

17:38.976 --> 17:40.976
I'm telling you, Dreyfus,
they did and it was incredible.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.859
Incredible? They're talking apes!

17:43.897 --> 17:46.017
- With big-ass Spears!
- Please!

17:46.066 --> 17:49.856
I don't know exactly what you think
you saw or heard...

17:50.571 --> 17:52.531
But you have to calm down, okay?

17:52.865 --> 17:55.955
What about the virus, Ellie?
Any chance of contagion?

17:55.993 --> 17:59.293
We're all genetically immune
or we would've been dead a long time ago.

17:59.329 --> 18:00.659
You don't know that for sure.

18:00.706 --> 18:02.116
She worked with the CDC.
She knows.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.165
What are we gonna do?

18:03.167 --> 18:04.827
I don't know.

18:05.169 --> 18:06.999
We need that power.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.125
He could've killed us, but he didn't.

18:09.173 --> 18:11.843
Maybe he kept us alive,
so they could follow us.

18:11.884 --> 18:14.974
They find out where we are,
and they kill us all!

18:15.012 --> 18:16.352
What do you mean, "he"?

18:16.388 --> 18:18.138
That's what we're trying to tell you.

18:18.182 --> 18:21.022
It was unlike anything you've
ever seen before, and the leader...

18:22.477 --> 18:23.647
He was remarkable.

18:23.896 --> 18:24.896
Really?

18:25.314 --> 18:27.154
- Is that what you thought?
- It's what we saw.

18:27.191 --> 18:28.481
Yeah, it's what we all saw.

18:28.525 --> 18:30.935
Not a word of this back at the colony,
you understand me?

18:30.986 --> 18:32.856
Not a word
until we can figure out what to do.

18:32.905 --> 18:35.415
- You gotta be kidding.
- No, I'm not kidding.

18:36.742 --> 18:38.912
I don't want to create a panic.

18:57.387 --> 18:59.387
How are you doing, pal?
Are you okay?

18:59.723 --> 19:01.683
- I dropped my bag.
- I know.

19:01.725 --> 19:03.725
- Was your sketchbook in there?
- It's gone.

19:04.019 --> 19:07.229
Carver just told me we're not gonna tell
anybody what happened up there.

19:07.272 --> 19:08.942
Not yet. No.

19:36.301 --> 19:37.931
Must attack them now!

19:38.262 --> 19:40.142
Before they attack us!

19:40.889 --> 19:42.849
We don't know how many there are.

19:43.225 --> 19:45.355
How many guns they have?

19:46.436 --> 19:49.436
Or why they came up here?

19:56.530 --> 19:59.370
They shot your son, rocket!

19:59.908 --> 20:01.328
Don't you want to fight?

20:02.536 --> 20:05.326
I follow Caesar.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.884
Koba's right!

20:10.627 --> 20:12.837
They almost killed you, ash!

20:17.759 --> 20:19.259
No!

20:24.391 --> 20:26.981
If we go to war...

20:27.019 --> 20:30.649
We could lose all we've built...

20:32.566 --> 20:34.396
Home.

20:37.154 --> 20:38.994
Family.

20:46.997 --> 20:48.617
Future.

20:55.214 --> 20:58.224
I will decide by morning.

21:09.811 --> 21:10.811
Caesar.

21:17.319 --> 21:20.279
For years I was a prisoner in their lab...

21:20.822 --> 21:22.452
They cut me...

21:22.491 --> 21:23.701
Tortured me.

21:25.911 --> 21:27.701
You freed me.

21:29.915 --> 21:32.045
I would do anything you ask.

21:35.087 --> 21:36.877
But we must show strength!

21:39.424 --> 21:41.894
We will, koba.

22:23.218 --> 22:26.888
Coming through. Coming through.

22:47.451 --> 22:50.291
That's a hell of a lot more than eighty!

23:18.357 --> 23:20.147
Malcolm!

23:51.348 --> 23:52.718
Apes...

23:54.560 --> 23:58.690
Do not want war...

23:59.356 --> 24:02.686
But will fight...

24:03.694 --> 24:06.824
If we must.

24:38.562 --> 24:41.612
Ape home.

24:43.066 --> 24:47.396
Human home.

24:52.117 --> 24:55.197
Do not come back.

25:34.993 --> 25:36.453
Everyone!

25:37.829 --> 25:41.119
Everyone, you have to calm down!

25:47.840 --> 25:49.800
Everybody.

25:50.467 --> 25:52.587
Everybody!

25:52.636 --> 25:56.426
Please! We're all immune!

25:56.473 --> 26:00.983
We're all immune,
or we wouldn't still be here!

26:01.019 --> 26:02.479
How did they find us?

26:03.981 --> 26:05.071
We found them.

26:05.107 --> 26:07.607
- You knew they were out there!
- What if they come back?

26:07.651 --> 26:09.571
Yeah!

26:09.611 --> 26:12.411
If they come back...
if they come back...

26:12.447 --> 26:15.487
They'll be sorry they ever did!

26:16.159 --> 26:18.749
Now, this city may not have the
manpower it once did...

26:18.787 --> 26:21.657
But it has the firepower.

26:22.332 --> 26:24.422
Those stockpiles left behind...

26:24.459 --> 26:29.169
By fema, the national guard,
we have it all.

26:29.214 --> 26:31.014
Look...

26:32.634 --> 26:35.014
I know why you're scared.

26:35.846 --> 26:39.516
I'm scared, too, believe me.

26:40.058 --> 26:43.398
But I recognize the trust
you've all placed in me.

26:43.937 --> 26:46.857
We've been through hell together.

26:48.358 --> 26:52.358
But you all know
what we're up against.

26:55.282 --> 26:58.122
We're almost out of fuel.

26:58.911 --> 27:01.501
Which means no more power...

27:01.538 --> 27:05.168
Which means we could slip back
to the way things were.

27:05.209 --> 27:09.209
That dam up there was the answer.

27:10.547 --> 27:13.427
We just had no idea
they were up there, too.

27:13.467 --> 27:14.507
So, what do we do now?

27:14.551 --> 27:16.851
Yeah!

27:16.887 --> 27:19.717
We find another way...

27:21.266 --> 27:23.686
Because that power...

27:23.727 --> 27:25.397
Is not just about keeping the lights on.

27:25.729 --> 27:28.229
It's about giving us the tools...

27:28.273 --> 27:30.733
To reconnect to the rest of the world.

27:30.776 --> 27:33.776
To find out who else is out there...

27:33.820 --> 27:38.070
So that we can start to rebuild...

27:39.660 --> 27:41.830
And reclaim...

27:44.414 --> 27:47.504
The world we lost.

27:51.255 --> 27:53.805
That was a great speech.

27:55.926 --> 27:58.846
There is no alternative power source.

27:59.930 --> 28:02.970
That dam is the only option.

28:07.688 --> 28:10.358
Well, then, we fight them.

28:14.319 --> 28:16.449
We're two weeks away
from running out of fuel.

28:16.488 --> 28:17.658
Maybe three, tops.

28:17.698 --> 28:18.908
I know.

28:18.949 --> 28:21.239
And once that happens...

28:21.285 --> 28:23.875
I won't be able to go out
there with a bullhorn...

28:24.371 --> 28:26.331
And calm everybody down.

28:26.874 --> 28:30.924
We need that power
to get the radio transmitter working.

28:30.961 --> 28:34.381
It's our only chance
of reaching the outside world.

28:34.631 --> 28:36.631
We have to find other survivors.

28:36.675 --> 28:39.675
Yeah. There's not that many of us left.

28:40.554 --> 28:42.604
We can't afford any more casualties.

28:42.639 --> 28:45.309
We founded this place...

28:45.809 --> 28:47.809
- You and I...
- I know.

28:48.187 --> 28:51.977
On the idea that power would lead us back
to the life we once had.

28:52.566 --> 28:54.726
If we can't stick together,
maybe we can't survive.

28:55.319 --> 28:57.319
I lost everything.

28:58.864 --> 29:02.834
The idea of losing what little I have is...

29:05.662 --> 29:07.002
I want to go back up there.

29:09.166 --> 29:11.996
Listen to me. Give me three days.

29:12.044 --> 29:14.054
Let me talk to him.
If it doesn't work, then we do it your way.

29:14.421 --> 29:16.631
And what if it backfires?
What if he gets violent?

29:16.673 --> 29:20.393
I mean, how do you know
that he'll even understand you?

29:24.014 --> 29:26.434
He's more than just an ape.

29:28.352 --> 29:30.982
I'm gonna take some men
up to fort point.

29:31.021 --> 29:32.901
I'm gonna go through the armory.

29:33.565 --> 29:35.725
I'm gonna see what's still working.

29:37.027 --> 29:38.397
Three days.

29:38.445 --> 29:39.815
You're not back in three days...

29:39.863 --> 29:43.373
We're going up there, and we're
gonna kill every last one of them.

29:59.508 --> 30:02.138
Carver is getting the trucks ready.

30:02.177 --> 30:04.887
He'll be here with foster and kemp
any minute.

30:05.639 --> 30:08.639
You're really taking carver?
I mean, he shot one of them.

30:08.684 --> 30:10.064
I don't really have any choice.

30:10.102 --> 30:14.942
He used to work at the water department. He's
the only one who knows how the dam works.

30:16.567 --> 30:18.027
Malcolm...

30:18.068 --> 30:21.648
What are you gonna do up there?
What are you gonna say?

30:23.532 --> 30:25.832
I'll tell him the truth.

30:26.451 --> 30:28.831
Hope I catch him in a good mood.

30:34.001 --> 30:36.041
You think I'm crazy.

30:37.129 --> 30:38.879
I'm worried.

30:39.631 --> 30:41.801
Yeah, so am I.

30:42.801 --> 30:45.261
I've gone over it in my head...

30:46.513 --> 30:49.603
And I think if I don't at least try this...

30:50.893 --> 30:52.983
There's gonna be a war.

31:15.417 --> 31:16.457
Take me with you.

31:16.502 --> 31:18.802
What if someone gets hurt?
You'll need me there.

31:22.049 --> 31:24.299
I love you.

31:25.719 --> 31:27.599
But I need you to stay here.

31:28.639 --> 31:31.059
I don't want Alexander to be alone.

31:31.099 --> 31:33.349
I'm coming, too.

31:36.980 --> 31:38.310
Son, it's not safe.

31:39.691 --> 31:41.691
But I'm safer with you
than I am down here.

31:42.611 --> 31:44.491
I'm coming.

31:44.530 --> 31:45.820
Please.

32:13.600 --> 32:16.480
No one gets out of the trucks.

32:16.812 --> 32:18.402
No one.

32:18.856 --> 32:22.356
If I'm not back in two hours,
you get everyone back to the city.

32:23.110 --> 32:25.110
It's gonna be okay.

35:27.294 --> 35:30.304
Please. Please. Please.

35:33.592 --> 35:35.222
Please don't kill me.

35:35.802 --> 35:38.722
Just hear what I have to say.

35:39.681 --> 35:41.101
I know.

35:42.935 --> 35:46.105
"Don't come back." I know.

35:46.563 --> 35:48.443
I wouldn't be here unless it were...

35:48.482 --> 35:50.282
okay! Okay! Okay!

35:54.029 --> 35:57.119
Okay, okay, okay.

35:58.617 --> 36:01.537
I need to show you something.

36:01.578 --> 36:02.788
It's not far.

36:02.829 --> 36:04.249
Human lies!

36:04.498 --> 36:06.748
No! No!

36:08.961 --> 36:11.051
No, no, no. I swear.

36:13.590 --> 36:17.050
If I could just show you,
then you'll understand.

36:17.094 --> 36:18.644
Please.

36:38.699 --> 36:41.579
Show me.

37:04.683 --> 37:08.523
This is what we used to call
a "small hydro."

37:08.562 --> 37:11.442
It was built to service
areas to the north of here...

37:11.481 --> 37:14.781
But we've been working to
reroute the power lines to the city...

37:14.818 --> 37:17.528
Because the city used to run off nuclear
power, but that ran out years ago.

37:17.571 --> 37:20.121
So, we've been using
diesel generators and gasifiers.

37:20.157 --> 37:23.027
But if we can just
get this dam working...

37:23.076 --> 37:27.366
Then we have a shot
at restoring limited power.

37:34.505 --> 37:37.425
Is any of this making any sense to you?

37:38.550 --> 37:41.550
The... lights.

37:41.595 --> 37:43.355
Yes.

37:44.431 --> 37:45.521
The lights.

37:46.850 --> 37:48.520
This is your home...

37:48.560 --> 37:51.350
And I don't want to take it away from you,
I promise.

37:51.396 --> 37:56.106
But if you can let us do our work here...

37:56.151 --> 37:58.031
you brought others?

38:02.366 --> 38:03.736
Just a few.

38:04.701 --> 38:06.661
I'm not a threat.

38:06.703 --> 38:08.163
If I am...

38:08.872 --> 38:11.582
Then I guess you can kill me.

38:36.400 --> 38:38.900
Come on!

38:39.945 --> 38:43.075
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Stop, stop.

38:55.169 --> 38:56.749
We need to give them our guns.

38:58.755 --> 39:00.915
That's the one condition.

39:01.508 --> 39:02.588
What does that mean?

39:03.510 --> 39:05.390
We can stay.

39:20.235 --> 39:23.315
If they get power, they'll
be more dangerous!

39:23.739 --> 39:25.319
Why help them?!

39:25.574 --> 39:27.664
They seem desperate...

39:28.452 --> 39:31.122
If we make them go, they'll attack.

39:31.455 --> 39:33.545
Let them.

39:33.582 --> 39:37.002
We'll destroy them while they're weak.

39:38.045 --> 39:41.055
And how many apes will die?

39:43.550 --> 39:46.640
We have one chance for peace...

39:47.221 --> 39:50.181
Let them do their human work.
Then they'll go.

39:52.434 --> 39:54.314
Human work?

39:57.397 --> 39:59.897
Human work.

40:02.110 --> 40:04.990
Human work.

40:05.739 --> 40:07.279
Human work!

40:45.612 --> 40:47.032
Koba say...

40:47.281 --> 40:49.491
Apes should hate humans...

40:49.533 --> 40:50.533
Enough!

40:50.909 --> 40:53.039
From humans koba learned hate...

40:53.370 --> 40:55.000
But nothing else.

41:09.011 --> 41:10.511
Hey.

41:10.846 --> 41:12.006
You need to eat.

41:12.848 --> 41:14.718
Okay.

41:14.975 --> 41:17.065
That was brave, what you did today.

41:25.319 --> 41:26.949
Malcolm.

41:27.237 --> 41:28.907
I know everyone's depending on you...

41:28.947 --> 41:32.617
I don't care about that.
I don't care about any of that.

41:33.535 --> 41:34.785
I care about him.

41:36.788 --> 41:40.958
He saw things that no kid should see,
and I'm not letting us go back to that.

41:45.714 --> 41:47.594
I know.

41:57.434 --> 41:59.984
I have been trying
to get closer to him.

42:00.604 --> 42:02.064
But...

42:02.814 --> 42:04.154
You will.

42:08.862 --> 42:12.032
You know the scary thing about them?

42:12.074 --> 42:15.334
They don't need power, lights.

42:16.286 --> 42:19.156
Heat. Nothing.

42:19.206 --> 42:20.036
Hey, pal.

42:20.082 --> 42:21.622
That's their advantage.

42:22.584 --> 42:25.214
That's what makes them stronger.

42:25.254 --> 42:28.054
Malcolm, I'm thinking one of us
should stand guard tonight.

42:28.090 --> 42:30.300
With what? They took our guns.

42:30.342 --> 42:31.842
If they wanted us dead,
we would be dead already.

42:31.885 --> 42:34.295
Maybe they're just taking their time.

42:34.346 --> 42:35.946
They killed off half the planet already.

42:36.348 --> 42:37.348
Come on.

42:37.349 --> 42:38.429
What?

42:38.475 --> 42:40.265
You can't honestly blame the apes.

42:40.310 --> 42:44.060
Who the hell else am I going to blame?
It was the simian flu.

42:44.106 --> 42:45.976
It was a virus created
by scientists in a lab.

42:46.024 --> 42:48.784
The chimps they were testing on
didn't have a say in the matter.

42:48.819 --> 42:50.649
Spare me the hippie-dippie bullshit.

42:50.696 --> 42:53.866
You're telling me you don't get
sick to your stomach at the sight of them?

42:58.036 --> 42:59.446
Didn't you have a little girl?

42:59.496 --> 43:00.496
Carver, that's enough.

43:00.539 --> 43:02.329
- How did she die?
- That's enough!

43:02.374 --> 43:03.384
Or your wife, for that matter.

43:03.417 --> 43:04.627
Carver, you better shut up...

43:04.668 --> 43:06.588
Before I kick your ass.

43:10.048 --> 43:11.168
Okay.

43:13.969 --> 43:16.599
I'm the asshole.

43:21.310 --> 43:23.400
Are you okay?

43:41.997 --> 43:46.127
You sound sick... you ok?

43:48.545 --> 43:50.205
Just need rest.

43:57.346 --> 44:00.886
You worry about the humans...

45:01.118 --> 45:02.868
Where's koba?

45:03.245 --> 45:06.795
Still angry.

45:08.208 --> 45:11.458
Said he was going hunting...

45:19.052 --> 45:21.142
Look, humans below!

45:34.318 --> 45:35.988
Why are we here?

45:36.528 --> 45:39.198
Caesar trusts humans...

45:39.740 --> 45:41.830
Koba does not.

45:43.368 --> 45:45.328
Most of the arsenal seems functional.

45:45.370 --> 45:46.290
Good.

45:46.330 --> 45:48.000
We're testing them out back.

46:35.254 --> 46:36.884
Hey!

46:37.923 --> 46:39.263
Don't you move!

46:39.299 --> 46:42.299
Don't move, do you understand me?

46:43.220 --> 46:44.550
Terry!

46:44.972 --> 46:47.392
Terry, get in here, quick!

46:54.022 --> 46:56.152
Holy shit.

46:58.777 --> 47:01.817
What do we do?
What do we do?

47:01.864 --> 47:03.284
Where did he come from?

47:04.032 --> 47:06.582
- Should we shoot him?
- Maybe. I don't know.

47:10.455 --> 47:13.075
You are one ugly son of a bitch,
aren't you?

47:31.935 --> 47:34.055
Whoa, man.

47:38.609 --> 47:40.239
Dude, I think he's hungry.

47:40.277 --> 47:42.737
He must have gotten separated
from the others.

47:42.779 --> 47:43.859
You lost?

47:44.615 --> 47:46.955
Trying to get home?

47:47.784 --> 47:50.584
Go on! Get out of here, stupid monkey!

47:50.621 --> 47:53.371
Go on. You heard him. Go!

48:01.298 --> 48:03.718
Enough guns here to kill every ape...

48:04.635 --> 48:06.185
Must warn Caesar.

48:06.220 --> 48:08.510
Who knows what humans are
really doing up there?

48:28.158 --> 48:30.788
We gotta clear this blockage.

48:36.041 --> 48:37.671
I didn't know you had a daughter.

48:42.840 --> 48:44.340
Yeah.

48:49.680 --> 48:51.140
What was her name?

48:56.186 --> 48:58.186
Sarah.

49:02.693 --> 49:04.533
I'm really sorry.

49:11.159 --> 49:15.499
Well, now I have you and your dad, so...

49:22.254 --> 49:24.424
Yeah.

49:24.464 --> 49:26.384
All right, you got that straight?

49:36.393 --> 49:38.193
Whoa.

49:38.228 --> 49:40.188
That's all the wire we got.

49:40.814 --> 49:43.024
Brace yourselves.

49:44.151 --> 49:48.321
Three, two, one.

49:53.994 --> 49:56.334
- Dad!
- Malcolm!

50:01.043 --> 50:03.803
Malcolm! Malcolm!

50:03.837 --> 50:04.837
Dad?

50:05.422 --> 50:06.672
I can't see carver.

50:30.572 --> 50:31.872
Don't!

50:31.907 --> 50:33.907
- Leave it there.
- I got it.

50:36.328 --> 50:38.408
It's not broken.

50:39.498 --> 50:42.328
Let go. Good.

50:54.263 --> 50:55.813
Thank you.

50:57.307 --> 50:58.807
You saved our lives.

50:59.434 --> 51:00.894
We've got a lot of debris to clear now.

51:00.936 --> 51:02.136
We might need a bit more time.

51:02.145 --> 51:03.975
How long?

51:42.269 --> 51:43.439
Hey, buddy.

51:50.360 --> 51:51.860
Hey... hey...

51:52.362 --> 51:54.612
What are you doing? Are you finished?

51:57.451 --> 51:58.581
What are you looking at?

52:07.377 --> 52:08.747
Hey! Hey!

52:09.630 --> 52:11.590
Hey, get out of there!

52:16.887 --> 52:19.177
- Hey! I'll kill you!
- Carver, what're you doing?

52:23.894 --> 52:25.274
Don't! Don't!

52:25.312 --> 52:27.152
Caesar, no!

52:27.189 --> 52:28.399
No.

52:42.913 --> 52:47.463
Said no guns!

52:51.088 --> 52:52.628
- No, don't.
- Please.

53:24.454 --> 53:26.334
I didn't know.

53:33.338 --> 53:36.798
Human leave now!

54:21.595 --> 54:23.265
Man, we screwed now.

54:26.892 --> 54:28.272
Malcolm?

54:29.019 --> 54:31.149
Malcolm, where are you going?

54:31.188 --> 54:32.188
Malcolm.

54:38.570 --> 54:41.070
Please, please,
I just need to speak to him.

54:44.076 --> 54:47.366
I'm sorry. That was all my fault.
But I will make him leave.

54:47.788 --> 54:50.618
This my home.

54:52.292 --> 54:54.042
You should not be here.

54:54.419 --> 54:55.879
I understand.

54:55.921 --> 54:57.921
Malcolm.

55:02.636 --> 55:04.046
She's sick.

55:06.223 --> 55:08.313
How long has she been this way?

55:15.983 --> 55:18.073
I have medicine.

55:19.069 --> 55:20.989
Antibiotics.

55:23.240 --> 55:24.410
Maybe she can help.

55:26.910 --> 55:30.660
Do not trust you.

55:32.916 --> 55:34.996
I don't blame you.

55:35.502 --> 55:37.882
But believe me...

55:37.921 --> 55:39.711
We are not all like him.

55:39.756 --> 55:41.256
Please.

55:42.759 --> 55:44.929
Let us help you.

56:14.041 --> 56:15.291
One day.

56:17.503 --> 56:20.673
You stay one day.

56:21.507 --> 56:23.007
Father, no...!

56:23.050 --> 56:25.680
- We might need more time.
- One day!

56:30.098 --> 56:32.138
Ape will help.

56:35.854 --> 56:38.734
I will not help!

56:42.194 --> 56:44.034
- This is bullshit, man!
- Get him out of here.

56:44.154 --> 56:46.954
Move! That's enough.
Come on, get out of here.

56:46.990 --> 56:48.740
Come on, man.

56:54.831 --> 56:56.001
Okay?

56:57.584 --> 56:59.884
Move, come on!

57:04.508 --> 57:06.048
Get in!

57:21.024 --> 57:23.154
See you tomorrow, asshole.

57:28.198 --> 57:31.118
Just came from the city.
Humans very dangerous!

57:31.660 --> 57:33.540
Where is Caesar?

57:37.374 --> 57:40.214
With the humans...

57:45.507 --> 57:47.007
Yo, Alex.

57:47.050 --> 57:50.260
This relay's busted.
See if there's another one.

57:50.304 --> 57:51.304
Yeah.

58:12.784 --> 58:14.664
Caesar.

58:20.375 --> 58:21.375
Hey!

58:24.213 --> 58:25.843
No! No, no, no, don't!

58:25.881 --> 58:27.381
No! No! No!

58:34.515 --> 58:38.025
Where Caesar? Want Caesar.

58:38.352 --> 58:40.152
Caesar!

58:56.328 --> 59:00.618
Humans attack your sons.

59:00.666 --> 59:04.586
You let them stay!

59:06.505 --> 59:09.725
Put apes in danger!

59:11.760 --> 59:15.930
Caesar love humans more...

59:15.973 --> 59:17.353
Than apes!

59:18.851 --> 59:22.151
More than your...

59:22.187 --> 59:24.147
Sons.

01:00:11.195 --> 01:00:12.655
Ape...

01:00:13.655 --> 01:00:15.445
Not...

01:00:15.490 --> 01:00:17.330
Kill...

01:00:17.367 --> 01:00:19.037
Ape.

01:00:47.356 --> 01:00:49.396
Forgive me.

01:01:23.475 --> 01:01:25.765
You are my son...

01:01:27.229 --> 01:01:29.689
I need you to listen...

01:01:41.618 --> 01:01:45.458
You didn't tell Caesar
about the guns we found?

01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:50.790
Neither will you.

01:02:02.556 --> 01:02:06.596
Your father doesn't trust me now.

01:02:07.728 --> 01:02:10.558
You need to protect him.

01:02:10.939 --> 01:02:13.649
His love for humans...

01:02:14.234 --> 01:02:16.154
Makes him blind.

01:02:16.195 --> 01:02:17.995
I know...

01:02:18.864 --> 01:02:22.874
As long as they are here...

01:02:24.828 --> 01:02:28.748
I fear for Caesar's life.

01:03:19.132 --> 01:03:20.222
For yesterday.

01:03:44.741 --> 01:03:47.121
Look. Look.

01:03:47.160 --> 01:03:48.160
Watch.

01:03:48.579 --> 01:03:50.499
Watch.

01:03:50.539 --> 01:03:52.249
"It was Friday.

01:03:53.167 --> 01:03:55.377
"A real nice afternoon.

01:03:56.003 --> 01:03:57.593
"Warm.

01:04:00.924 --> 01:04:03.054
"We were hanging...

01:04:03.886 --> 01:04:06.296
"We were hanging out...

01:04:06.346 --> 01:04:09.096
"At this kegger down
at the swimming hole."

01:04:11.268 --> 01:04:13.018
Hanging out.

01:04:15.522 --> 01:04:17.442
Hanging.

01:04:19.067 --> 01:04:21.897
Here. You can read?

01:04:32.122 --> 01:04:34.122
Now, this is the good stuff.

01:04:36.710 --> 01:04:38.750
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:04:45.260 --> 01:04:49.260
What the hell is wrong with you?
I thought we told you to go home!

01:04:49.765 --> 01:04:51.315
No!

01:04:51.350 --> 01:04:53.890
No! Go!

01:04:57.231 --> 01:04:58.791
- He understood that, didn't he?
- Yeah.

01:05:00.067 --> 01:05:01.937
Hey, hey, hey!

01:05:01.985 --> 01:05:03.485
Hey, hey.

01:05:08.075 --> 01:05:08.875
Hey.

01:05:08.909 --> 01:05:11.909
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:05:14.623 --> 01:05:16.123
I think he likes you.

01:05:16.166 --> 01:05:17.706
Shut up.

01:05:17.751 --> 01:05:19.501
All right, all right.

01:05:20.504 --> 01:05:23.514
You want a drink, fugly?

01:05:23.549 --> 01:05:25.759
Go on, give him some.

01:05:25.801 --> 01:05:28.221
Give him some, man.
See what happens.

01:05:31.223 --> 01:05:32.103
There you go.

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:33.890
Whoa, hey!

01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:37.810
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:05:39.147 --> 01:05:40.147
Shit!

01:05:45.112 --> 01:05:46.202
That's good, huh?

01:05:48.407 --> 01:05:50.027
Hey, hey, hey!

01:05:50.075 --> 01:05:51.735
Okay. All right.

01:05:53.161 --> 01:05:53.951
Easy.

01:05:53.996 --> 01:05:54.826
Yeah.

01:05:54.872 --> 01:05:56.122
- Easy.
- Easy.

01:05:56.164 --> 01:05:57.174
All right...

01:06:45.964 --> 01:06:47.764
Malcolm!

01:06:47.799 --> 01:06:49.089
Malcolm!

01:06:49.134 --> 01:06:51.684
What is it? What happened?

01:08:29.109 --> 01:08:30.738
It worked.

01:08:31.862 --> 01:08:33.862
At least here it did.

01:08:33.906 --> 01:08:36.696
We'll know when
we get back to the city.

01:08:43.497 --> 01:08:44.707
Trust.

01:09:10.192 --> 01:09:12.402
Son of a bitch.

01:09:12.861 --> 01:09:15.661
You son of a bitch!

01:10:01.326 --> 01:10:04.156
The... lights.

01:10:33.692 --> 01:10:35.822
Feeling better?

01:11:12.648 --> 01:11:15.728
Mother...?

01:12:26.638 --> 01:12:28.598
Human gun!

01:12:31.894 --> 01:12:33.274
Run.

01:12:47.618 --> 01:12:51.248
Humans kill Caesar!

01:12:55.959 --> 01:12:57.919
Burn ape home!

01:13:09.932 --> 01:13:11.812
Go! Get them!

01:13:12.267 --> 01:13:15.937
Apes must attack human city!

01:13:16.647 --> 01:13:18.767
Fight back!

01:13:19.191 --> 01:13:22.941
Come, fight for Caesar!

01:13:26.782 --> 01:13:28.872
Females and young stay in woods...

01:13:28.909 --> 01:13:30.489
We go to the city!

01:13:39.294 --> 01:13:42.344
We will avenge your father's death!

01:13:56.311 --> 01:13:58.361
Ellie! Ellie.

01:15:47.506 --> 01:15:50.086
This is San Francisco
attempting contact.

01:15:50.133 --> 01:15:51.473
If anyone is receiving this message...

01:15:51.510 --> 01:15:55.640
We ask that you identify yourself
and your location. Over.

01:16:08.026 --> 01:16:09.646
Move, move!

01:16:23.876 --> 01:16:27.956
If you are receiving this signal,
please state your location. Over.

01:16:28.005 --> 01:16:32.015
Repeat. This is San Francisco
attempting to establish contact.

01:16:32.050 --> 01:16:33.300
If you are receiving this signal...

01:16:33.343 --> 01:16:36.053
Please state your identity
and your location. Over.

01:16:37.639 --> 01:16:38.639
What is it?

01:16:38.640 --> 01:16:40.000
The apes attacked the armory, sir.

01:16:43.187 --> 01:16:46.727
Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm!

01:17:19.890 --> 01:17:24.770
Keep them off the walls!
Keep them off the walls!

01:17:28.440 --> 01:17:30.610
Let's go! Get into position.

01:17:34.905 --> 01:17:36.325
- You ready?
- Yes, sir.

01:17:36.365 --> 01:17:37.705
Good.

01:17:38.784 --> 01:17:40.044
Listen to me.

01:17:40.744 --> 01:17:43.914
We are survivors!

01:17:43.956 --> 01:17:46.366
Now, they may have got their hands
on some of our guns...

01:17:46.416 --> 01:17:48.706
But that does not make them men.

01:17:49.461 --> 01:17:51.341
They are animals!

01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:52.460
We will push them back!

01:17:53.382 --> 01:17:55.262
Drive them down!

01:17:55.300 --> 01:17:59.220
And they will not
get through these doors!

01:18:37.134 --> 01:18:38.804
There! California street!

01:20:26.785 --> 01:20:28.405
Bring me the rocket launcher!

01:22:41.879 --> 01:22:42.999
We have a beacon marking our location.

01:22:43.046 --> 01:22:45.256
Please, we need help.
We are under attack.

01:22:45.299 --> 01:22:47.009
San Francisco. Repeat.

01:22:47.050 --> 01:22:47.840
Hello?

01:22:47.885 --> 01:22:49.225
Do you copy?

01:23:15.579 --> 01:23:18.459
Humans escaping! Capture them!

01:23:40.687 --> 01:23:42.977
We must be getting close.

01:23:49.112 --> 01:23:51.362
I think I see it. It's down here!

01:23:55.327 --> 01:23:56.617
Dad!

01:24:13.303 --> 01:24:15.353
Oh, my God. Malcolm!

01:24:15.389 --> 01:24:16.809
Ellie, help me.

01:24:29.987 --> 01:24:31.317
My...

01:24:32.197 --> 01:24:33.317
Son...

01:24:36.118 --> 01:24:37.738
My...

01:24:38.412 --> 01:24:40.122
Family...

01:24:44.585 --> 01:24:45.965
Where?

01:24:50.591 --> 01:24:52.591
I don't know.

01:25:01.268 --> 01:25:04.938
Try not to speak. You need to rest.

01:25:14.114 --> 01:25:15.744
Hold.

01:25:26.585 --> 01:25:27.795
He's lost a lot of blood.

01:25:27.836 --> 01:25:29.456
Is he going to make it?

01:25:30.047 --> 01:25:31.547
I don't understand.

01:25:33.091 --> 01:25:34.801
Where did carver get the gun?

01:25:35.636 --> 01:25:37.216
Why would he do this?

01:25:37.262 --> 01:25:38.432
Ape...

01:25:40.974 --> 01:25:42.184
What?

01:25:45.229 --> 01:25:46.689
Ape...

01:25:47.231 --> 01:25:48.771
Did...

01:25:50.484 --> 01:25:52.154
This.

01:25:59.451 --> 01:26:01.371
Get in the truck.

01:26:21.723 --> 01:26:24.483
Followed the humans here.
Hiding everywhere!

01:26:25.060 --> 01:26:27.600
We must catch them all!

01:26:46.081 --> 01:26:47.621
Kill him.

01:26:47.666 --> 01:26:48.666
No, no, no.

01:26:54.256 --> 01:26:56.466
Go ahead ash...

01:26:56.884 --> 01:26:59.684
...make humans pay.

01:27:03.182 --> 01:27:06.482
Caesar wouldn't want this.

01:27:44.848 --> 01:27:47.978
Caesar gone...

01:27:53.190 --> 01:27:55.690
Apes follow...

01:27:56.443 --> 01:27:58.863
Koba now.

01:28:20.092 --> 01:28:22.432
Oh, my God.
Look, the colony's on fire.

01:28:22.469 --> 01:28:24.509
Where are we going to go?

01:28:24.555 --> 01:28:26.435
Caesar, what?

01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:36.940
Is this it?
Are we close?

01:28:37.234 --> 01:28:38.574
Where is he taking us?

01:28:41.572 --> 01:28:42.572
Malcolm, stop!

01:28:50.914 --> 01:28:54.294
I don't understand.
What are we doing here?

01:28:54.334 --> 01:28:55.384
It doesn't matter.

01:28:55.419 --> 01:28:58.379
We just need a place to hide him
until we find out what's going on at home.

01:29:02.926 --> 01:29:04.506
Go move the table.

01:29:08.265 --> 01:29:10.645
Okay. Right here.

01:29:11.768 --> 01:29:12.768
Okay.

01:29:17.608 --> 01:29:18.608
Dad, look.

01:29:20.485 --> 01:29:21.645
Look.

01:29:27.367 --> 01:29:29.697
We need to operate.
I don't have anything.

01:29:30.829 --> 01:29:32.579
There's a surgical kit
back at the place, but that's...

01:29:32.623 --> 01:29:33.673
I'll go.

01:29:36.001 --> 01:29:37.041
It's not safe.

01:29:37.085 --> 01:29:40.005
He's the only one that can stop this.

01:29:42.466 --> 01:29:44.176
Humans!

01:29:44.510 --> 01:29:48.220
You ape prisoner now!

01:29:48.263 --> 01:29:52.103
You will know life in cage.

01:29:53.310 --> 01:29:55.810
More humans out there.

01:29:56.522 --> 01:29:59.112
Go! Find them!

01:30:18.460 --> 01:30:20.420
Maurice...?

01:30:21.171 --> 01:30:23.091
Koba said...

01:30:23.799 --> 01:30:26.679
...we're too loyal to your father.

01:30:29.221 --> 01:30:32.851
Protect yourself.

01:31:52.596 --> 01:31:53.676
Shit!

01:33:03.876 --> 01:33:05.416
Hey, wait.

01:33:06.837 --> 01:33:08.297
Your father.

01:33:11.091 --> 01:33:13.091
He's alive.

01:33:25.397 --> 01:33:26.397
I got it.

01:33:26.857 --> 01:33:28.067
How is he?

01:33:52.966 --> 01:33:55.756
Your... mother.

01:33:58.263 --> 01:33:59.643
Brother.

01:34:00.807 --> 01:34:02.137
Safe?

01:34:03.477 --> 01:34:05.557
For now.

01:34:14.112 --> 01:34:15.162
No.

01:34:15.572 --> 01:34:16.702
No.

01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:22.370
Not human.

01:34:26.625 --> 01:34:28.215
Koba.

01:34:32.089 --> 01:34:33.089
Malcolm.

01:34:33.799 --> 01:34:35.259
Yeah.

01:34:36.927 --> 01:34:38.257
Caesar.

01:34:39.930 --> 01:34:42.060
We need to do this now.

01:34:46.061 --> 01:34:47.561
Son.

01:35:22.347 --> 01:35:24.017
How is he?

01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:27.850
We'll see.

01:35:29.354 --> 01:35:31.364
He's very strong.

01:35:40.782 --> 01:35:42.782
It's gonna be okay.

01:36:16.026 --> 01:36:18.066
I'm so sorry...

01:36:18.987 --> 01:36:20.567
For everything.

01:36:22.157 --> 01:36:23.657
No.

01:36:27.454 --> 01:36:29.164
I...

01:36:29.498 --> 01:36:30.868
Am to blame.

01:36:33.335 --> 01:36:35.545
But koba betrayed you.

01:36:35.879 --> 01:36:37.299
I...

01:36:37.339 --> 01:36:40.969
Chose to trust him...

01:36:41.635 --> 01:36:45.725
Because he is ape.

01:36:46.890 --> 01:36:49.230
I always think...

01:36:49.810 --> 01:36:53.690
Ape better than human.

01:36:55.983 --> 01:36:58.073
I see now...

01:36:59.862 --> 01:37:04.242
How much like them we are.

01:37:08.745 --> 01:37:11.075
Where koba now?

01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.290
On the human tower...

01:37:16.461 --> 01:37:18.711
Loyal apes around him.

01:37:18.755 --> 01:37:22.215
And those who not follow?

01:37:22.759 --> 01:37:24.639
Prisoners.

01:37:25.971 --> 01:37:27.351
Maurice.

01:37:28.015 --> 01:37:29.435
Rocket.

01:37:33.687 --> 01:37:35.977
Koba killed ash.

01:37:42.446 --> 01:37:44.486
Fear makes others follow.

01:37:47.034 --> 01:37:48.794
But when they see you alive...

01:37:50.370 --> 01:37:53.420
They will turn from koba.

01:37:53.457 --> 01:37:55.247
Not if I am weak.

01:37:58.128 --> 01:38:02.418
Ape always seek strongest branch.

01:38:05.552 --> 01:38:09.472
I must do something to stop him.

01:38:19.608 --> 01:38:21.318
Father.

01:38:23.987 --> 01:38:27.947
Let me help you.

01:39:19.168 --> 01:39:21.208
Please, let us out of here!

01:41:40.893 --> 01:41:42.023
Okay.

01:41:42.060 --> 01:41:43.940
Caesar, look.

01:41:44.855 --> 01:41:46.065
Apple.

01:41:46.732 --> 01:41:47.862
Apple.

01:41:48.275 --> 01:41:50.195
Good.

01:41:51.028 --> 01:41:52.198
Home.

01:41:52.905 --> 01:41:54.285
Home.

01:41:56.408 --> 01:41:57.778
Home.

01:41:59.536 --> 01:42:00.616
Yes.

01:42:02.539 --> 01:42:04.419
This is your home.

01:42:04.917 --> 01:42:06.377
Your home.

01:42:08.795 --> 01:42:10.625
Good. Good.

01:42:11.632 --> 01:42:13.222
That's good.

01:42:36.281 --> 01:42:37.911
Sorry.

01:42:37.950 --> 01:42:40.080
I didn't mean to intrude.

01:42:44.081 --> 01:42:46.461
It's been two days.

01:42:52.548 --> 01:42:54.718
Your son is not back yet?

01:42:59.721 --> 01:43:01.681
Who was that?

01:43:03.100 --> 01:43:04.730
On the video.

01:43:07.479 --> 01:43:10.819
A good man.

01:43:13.694 --> 01:43:16.034
Like you.

01:43:46.852 --> 01:43:48.812
They need to get to the tower
without being seen.

01:43:48.854 --> 01:43:50.814
I'm gonna take him through the subway.

01:43:51.607 --> 01:43:52.727
I love you.

01:43:53.317 --> 01:43:56.697
Koba sent for the females and young.

01:43:56.737 --> 01:43:59.277
They're on their way.

01:43:59.615 --> 01:44:01.035
Mother too.

01:44:02.451 --> 01:44:04.701
Must go. Now!

01:44:16.006 --> 01:44:17.166
Are you okay?

01:44:27.976 --> 01:44:29.306
Who's there?

01:44:29.978 --> 01:44:32.358
If you're human, you better say so!

01:44:32.397 --> 01:44:34.357
It's me! It's Malcolm!

01:44:34.399 --> 01:44:35.689
Don't shoot!

01:44:37.778 --> 01:44:39.148
Take the stairs.

01:44:39.196 --> 01:44:41.446
They'll bring you around and
up under the street, okay?

01:44:41.490 --> 01:44:42.530
Go.

01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:47.620
Thank you.

01:44:48.372 --> 01:44:50.212
Trust.

01:44:57.256 --> 01:44:59.296
All right, I'm coming out!

01:44:59.341 --> 01:45:01.051
Don't shoot!

01:45:18.861 --> 01:45:20.241
Hey!

01:45:20.279 --> 01:45:21.819
Look who I found.

01:45:21.864 --> 01:45:24.074
I didn't know if you'd made it out.

01:45:24.116 --> 01:45:25.276
Good to see you.

01:45:25.325 --> 01:45:26.865
Don't worry.

01:45:26.910 --> 01:45:28.580
We're gonna turn all this around.

01:45:28.620 --> 01:45:30.540
What do you mean? What's going on?

01:45:30.581 --> 01:45:32.421
The apes. They're all over the tower.

01:45:32.457 --> 01:45:34.327
I lost the signal. It dropped out.

01:45:34.376 --> 01:45:35.456
Keep trying.

01:45:35.502 --> 01:45:37.002
Malcolm, look at this.

01:45:38.380 --> 01:45:41.630
C-4. Five-pound blocks.

01:45:42.259 --> 01:45:44.509
We just started setting them.

01:45:44.553 --> 01:45:47.013
They're gonna take down the whole tower.

01:45:49.224 --> 01:45:51.564
Blast them all at once.

01:45:52.144 --> 01:45:54.064
We could use your help.

01:46:32.601 --> 01:46:35.981
This is San Francisco attempting contact.
If anyone is receiving this...

01:46:36.021 --> 01:46:39.111
We ask that you identify yourself and
your location. Over.

01:46:43.195 --> 01:46:45.115
Here.
Come on.

01:46:45.155 --> 01:46:47.815
If anyone is receiving this,
we ask that you identify yourself...

01:46:47.866 --> 01:46:49.616
And your location. Over.

01:46:58.043 --> 01:46:59.343
This is San Francisco...

01:46:59.378 --> 01:47:01.758
Attempting contact.
If anyone is receiving this...

01:47:01.797 --> 01:47:04.667
We ask that you identify yourself
and your location.

01:47:07.219 --> 01:47:09.179
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:47:16.520 --> 01:47:19.440
If anyone is receiving this,
we ask that you identify yourself...

01:47:19.481 --> 01:47:20.771
And your location. Over.

01:47:25.487 --> 01:47:26.567
Dreyfus.

01:47:30.784 --> 01:47:32.244
- Can anybody hear me?
- Werner.

01:47:35.622 --> 01:47:38.542
I'm sorry, but I can't let you do this.

01:47:39.835 --> 01:47:41.675
We need to give him a chance.

01:47:42.671 --> 01:47:44.591
We need to give him some time.

01:47:45.299 --> 01:47:47.009
He's up there right now.

01:47:49.595 --> 01:47:51.435
Who's up there?

01:48:28.008 --> 01:48:33.808
Caesar has no place here.

01:48:35.766 --> 01:48:37.806
Apes follow...

01:48:38.936 --> 01:48:40.596
Koba now.

01:48:44.191 --> 01:48:46.651
Follow koba...

01:48:47.611 --> 01:48:48.651
To war.

01:48:48.946 --> 01:48:51.526
Apes win war!

01:48:53.158 --> 01:48:56.448
Apes together strong!

01:49:01.625 --> 01:49:03.045
Caesar...

01:49:04.503 --> 01:49:05.843
Weak.

01:49:09.633 --> 01:49:12.723
Koba weaker.

01:50:02.019 --> 01:50:04.599
Are you out of your fucking mind?

01:50:05.355 --> 01:50:08.355
No, I've seen things.
I've seen the way they are.

01:50:09.193 --> 01:50:11.193
They want what we want, to survive.

01:50:11.236 --> 01:50:12.486
They don't want a war.

01:50:12.529 --> 01:50:14.159
They're animals!

01:50:14.198 --> 01:50:15.568
They attacked us!

01:50:15.616 --> 01:50:18.406
Because they thought we attacked them.
They think that he's dead, but he's not...

01:50:18.452 --> 01:50:20.042
sit down, Finney!

01:50:20.787 --> 01:50:22.207
Sit down!

01:50:45.562 --> 01:50:47.652
Trusted koba like brother.

01:50:47.981 --> 01:50:51.281
Caesar brother to human!

01:50:53.737 --> 01:50:56.407
Koba fight for ape!

01:50:56.740 --> 01:50:58.490
Free ape!

01:51:01.078 --> 01:51:02.448
Kill ape.

01:51:02.496 --> 01:51:04.076
Koba fight for koba.

01:51:12.923 --> 01:51:14.263
Koba...

01:51:14.800 --> 01:51:18.510
Belong in cage.

01:52:06.643 --> 01:52:08.773
I know how this must sound.

01:52:08.812 --> 01:52:09.972
I don't think you have any...

01:52:15.527 --> 01:52:17.567
do you think stopping me will matter?

01:52:18.155 --> 01:52:19.825
They're coming.

01:52:20.991 --> 01:52:23.411
Now, we made contact with a
military base up north.

01:52:24.369 --> 01:52:26.909
They're already on their way!

01:52:27.706 --> 01:52:28.826
It's true.

01:52:33.754 --> 01:52:34.634
Dreyfus!

01:52:34.671 --> 01:52:36.171
What are you doing, man?

01:52:46.350 --> 01:52:48.310
I'm saving the human race.

01:52:48.352 --> 01:52:49.352
No!

01:55:10.661 --> 01:55:11.871
Ape...

01:55:12.704 --> 01:55:14.664
Not kill...

01:55:15.541 --> 01:55:16.831
Ape.

01:55:42.359 --> 01:55:44.569
You are...

01:55:46.363 --> 01:55:48.203
Not ape.

01:55:52.035 --> 01:55:53.615
No!

01:57:07.945 --> 01:57:09.455
Leave him!

01:57:27.297 --> 01:57:29.007
You're not safe here.

01:57:29.633 --> 01:57:32.343
They made contact.
Other people are coming. Soldiers.

01:57:32.928 --> 01:57:34.968
You have to leave now. Everyone.

01:57:35.973 --> 01:57:39.643
If you don't go,
it'll be all-out war.

01:57:39.685 --> 01:57:41.445
War...

01:57:41.478 --> 01:57:43.608
Has already...

01:57:44.690 --> 01:57:45.820
Begun.

01:57:47.818 --> 01:57:50.568
Ape started war.

01:57:53.699 --> 01:57:55.409
And human...

01:57:57.828 --> 01:58:00.868
Human will not forgive.

01:58:04.084 --> 01:58:07.844
You must go...

01:58:08.172 --> 01:58:11.882
Before fighting begins.

01:58:13.719 --> 01:58:15.509
I am sorry...

01:58:18.015 --> 01:58:20.935
My friend.

01:58:25.689 --> 01:58:28.569
I thought we had a chance.

01:58:31.945 --> 01:58:34.565
I did, too.
