01:41.715 --> 01:44.522
- Thanks for comin'. Nice to see you.
- Why are we slouchin'?

01:45.584 --> 01:47.237
I don't have
that much time. Look.

01:47.237 --> 01:49.958
The gates are gonna be open
between 11:00 and midnight. All right?

01:50.088 --> 01:53.182
I got my guy on the gate. You go
right through, no fuss, no muss.

01:53.258 --> 01:56.595
- What are you worryin' for?
- I'm not worried. Ah, let me worry!

01:56.595 --> 01:58.822
All right, all right, all right.
Where's the stuff, huh?

02:03.235 --> 02:06.335
Whoa, that's a lot of toxic waste
you got, pal. You got a problem, baby.

02:06.404 --> 02:09.840
No, you got !
Just get it to Jersey and dump it!

02:09.907 --> 02:12.630
Dumpin' it's a federal rap.
I'm takin' all the chances.

02:12.630 --> 02:14.057
That's why we pay you!

02:16.100 --> 02:18.859
All right, come on, come on.
Where's the money? Yo, the money.

02:19.237 --> 02:21.191
Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

02:22.180 --> 02:25.238
What is this, the tip?
This the tip?

02:25.688 --> 02:27.857
You deal with the E.P.A.
See what it costs you!

02:27.857 --> 02:29.382
Well, make sure
you're there by 11:00.

02:34.225 --> 02:37.160
What are you guys, crazy?
Wanna blow up the goddamn joint?

02:45.736 --> 02:48.319
You drive carefully.
I don't want you to hit anybody.

02:48.706 --> 02:51.834
Oh, here we go,
into the tunnel of love.

02:51.909 --> 02:54.254
All right, get over, get over.
Who's got the cards?

03:22.488 --> 03:27.069
We collected 32,563 tolls
between the first and second rock.

03:33.050 --> 03:34.092
<i>Grace!</i>

03:35.720 --> 03:38.687
<i>Grace, are you in there?
Come back. Grace!</i>

03:41.859 --> 03:43.918
I found this
under my bed.

03:44.206 --> 03:47.532
You think you could be
a little less discreet?

03:48.380 --> 03:50.329
I found this
under my bed.

03:51.776 --> 03:53.597
I'll see you after work.

03:54.368 --> 03:57.437
<i>Listen, when I return this,
I have somethin' to tell you.</i>

03:57.508 --> 03:59.360
Tell me now.
If it is good news,

03:59.360 --> 04:01.727
why not get it now and
have a completely good day?

04:01.727 --> 04:03.746
As opposed to one filled
with apprehension and tension,

04:03.746 --> 04:08.430
which can lead to other related
physical disorders and high anxiety.

04:08.430 --> 04:11.032
No, I will tell you later,
Island Girl.

04:11.314 --> 04:16.185
<i>- Tell me now.
- No. I'll tell you tonight.</i>

04:20.998 --> 04:23.923
<i>- Hey, Frankie, how's your load?
- Mostly in my shorts.</i>

04:23.923 --> 04:25.362
<i>I need a pit stop, bad.</i>

04:25.362 --> 04:27.292
<i>Just hold it.
We're behind schedule, man.</i>

04:33.711 --> 04:34.916
Need some help
with that bag?

04:34.916 --> 04:37.600
Maybe you need some
other kind of help, sweet lady.

04:38.015 --> 04:40.630
Stuck-up bitch !

05:17.221 --> 05:20.247
"Dear Mr. Thompson."
Thanks a lot.

05:20.324 --> 05:21.407
"Thank you
for your submission.

05:21.407 --> 05:24.033
Regretfully,
at this time, we..."

05:25.596 --> 05:29.251
... are laughing our asses off that
you even wasted the stamps...

05:29.333 --> 05:31.542
by sending us your play.

05:43.658 --> 05:46.047
<i>Hi, it's Maddy.
I'm out. The machine is in.</i>

05:46.633 --> 05:48.011
<i>Maddy, hi. It's Kimberly.</i>

05:48.119 --> 05:49.811
<i>I have this really
important audition,</i>

05:49.811 --> 05:52.222
<i>and I told Claudio
you'd take my life shift today.</i>

05:52.222 --> 05:55.168
<i>I did it for you
when you went to Bermuda. Bye!</i>

05:59.735 --> 06:01.156
Gotcha!

06:03.156 --> 06:05.534
<i>Hi, it's Maddy.
I'm out. The machine is in.</i>

06:06.368 --> 06:08.700
<i>Maddy, it's David.</i>

06:10.741 --> 06:13.372
<i>I feel really bad
about the way things ended up</i>

06:13.372 --> 06:17.458
<i>and I... I want you to give me
three more months, and I...</i>

06:17.679 --> 06:21.451
<i>I promise I'll...
I-I promise I'll tell her. I promise.</i>

06:21.519 --> 06:23.645
<i>Honey,
you got to cut the cake!</i>

06:23.645 --> 06:27.137
<i>- I'll be right in. I'll be right in.
- Oh!</i>

06:27.825 --> 06:30.429
<i>It's George's birthday, and, uh,
we... we're having a party,</i>

06:30.429 --> 06:32.141
<i>and-and-and
call me on Monday.</i>

06:32.141 --> 06:34.683
<i>I-I-I love you.</i>

06:37.456 --> 06:38.529
Go!

06:47.211 --> 06:49.975
<i>Traffic report says the bridge
is backed up to Westchester.</i>

06:50.047 --> 06:52.174
<i>Forget the bridge.
Take one of the tunnels.</i>

06:58.989 --> 07:03.289
<i>The "Territory Beyond."
It's still out there.</i>

07:05.096 --> 07:09.430
<I>The "Territory Beyond."
It's still out there.

07:10.935 --> 07:13.961
<i>- The "Territory Beyond."
- It's still out there.</i>

07:14.038 --> 07:17.910
<i>The "Territory Beyond."
It's still out there.</i>

07:20.053 --> 07:22.769
It's exhausting being me.

07:25.416 --> 07:26.731
Now the question is
what do we do with it?

07:26.731 --> 07:28.466
Sales are down
an average of 12%.

07:28.466 --> 07:30.788
Broadening our marketing target
from inner-city youth

07:30.788 --> 07:33.353
to the more affluent
off-road vehicle group...

07:33.424 --> 07:34.853
I know that.

07:35.025 --> 07:35.948
Give me something
I don't know.

07:35.948 --> 07:39.032
We're gonna have to stack some
pretty heavy GRP's with this commercial,

07:39.032 --> 07:40.317
no matter where we run it.

07:40.531 --> 07:44.490
- Now, the test results are maxing out...
- Speak English, Elliot.

07:44.568 --> 07:47.254
We wanna put it
on the Super Bowl, first quarter.

07:48.772 --> 07:50.026
Super Bowl.

07:50.941 --> 07:54.206
- That's a whole pile of money.
- It's time to gamble, Roy.

07:54.537 --> 07:56.968
It's not like
we have any choice.

08:00.317 --> 08:04.921
Okay. We'll buy 60 in the first quarter
and we'll do a cut-down 30 in the second.

08:04.922 --> 08:07.117
You wanna gamble ?
Let's gamble.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.107
Jonno, let's go.

08:09.730 --> 08:11.454
- How we doin' on time ?
- Traffic's a mess.

08:11.454 --> 08:13.839
But if we take the tunnel,
we'll just make it.

08:13.839 --> 08:15.247
Let's take the tunnel.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.101
Come on, Cooper. Okay.
That's a boy. It's all over.

08:19.101 --> 08:20.387
We're gonna have
a nice day in the city.

08:20.387 --> 08:20.920
Good boy.

08:20.920 --> 08:24.521
You know, whatever good that specialist
does is undone by the long drive in.

08:24.521 --> 08:27.639
He hates riding in the car.
Puts him off for days.

08:27.912 --> 08:29.848
We're not taking him back
to that quack in Colts Neck.

08:29.848 --> 08:32.563
Look, Eleanor,
he's perfectly capable.

08:32.563 --> 08:34.542
We don't even know
what's wrong with the dog.

08:34.542 --> 08:35.429
Who knows him best?

08:35.429 --> 08:37.722
Me or a complete stranger?
Let's go this way.

08:37.722 --> 08:38.193
All right.

08:38.193 --> 08:39.804
- You know what I'd like to do?
- What?

08:40.091 --> 08:41.725
I'd like to go
to Rumpelmayer's.

08:41.725 --> 08:45.285
- Cooper loves their cherry-vanilla.
- I think that's a brilliant idea.

08:49.967 --> 08:52.106
- So, what'd they get you for, man?
- They got me for stealin'.

08:52.106 --> 08:54.310
What you up here? For
cheating on your expense account?

08:54.605 --> 08:57.477
No, I, uh, I sell cellular phones
with cloned numbers.

08:57.625 --> 08:59.508
So, how much you get
from the register?

08:59.677 --> 09:02.714
- I don't know. Hundred, two hundred.
- Yeah? You use a gun?

09:02.714 --> 09:05.247
No, I used my looks. Of course
I used a gun! What you think?

09:05.247 --> 09:08.203
Listen, I sell five to ten phones
a week for 500 dollars apiece.

09:08.412 --> 09:10.947
I don't use a gun.
Can you multiply?

09:11.021 --> 09:12.962
I ain't stupid, man.
I know my math. I...

09:13.104 --> 09:15.062
If you so smart,
why you up in here?

09:17.267 --> 09:20.407
I guess I shouldn't have bought
that BMW for cash, huh?

09:36.614 --> 09:37.243
That's ridiculous!

09:37.243 --> 09:39.765
He's the top man in his field.
I wouldn't dismiss him that lightly.

09:40.170 --> 09:43.510
Okay, dr. O'Corr, it says here
you got a 5:30 flight out of Newark,

09:43.587 --> 09:45.994
but you wanna stop off
at St. Vincent's first, is that right?

09:45.994 --> 09:48.116
- That's right.
- And actually Lewis has been working...

09:48.192 --> 09:48.987
Well, that's gonna be tight.

09:49.128 --> 09:51.856
Yeah, well, there's a 50-dollar tip
in it for you if you make it, okay?

09:51.996 --> 09:55.445
Then again, miracles do happen.
Right, doc?

10:08.779 --> 10:12.237
This sucks. I wanna go back
and skate at Rockefeller Center.

10:12.316 --> 10:14.880
Hey, how about somebody else
does something they enjoy?

10:14.915 --> 10:17.510
You wanna visit old school friends,
leave me out of it.

10:17.741 --> 10:21.337
A family vacation is about
staying with the family.

10:21.558 --> 10:24.649
Let's not talk about
staying anywhere, okay?

10:49.720 --> 10:51.005
- Hey, asshole!
- Hey!

10:51.567 --> 10:53.772
Wha-what do you want? What?
What do you want?

10:54.865 --> 10:55.902
Hold still!

10:55.937 --> 10:58.552
- No, not that, please !
- Shut up !

10:58.796 --> 11:01.878
We got it!
Come on. Let's go!

11:01.878 --> 11:03.012
Come on! Come on!

11:21.218 --> 11:24.381
Good afternoon.
Thirty-six channels and nothing's on.

11:24.455 --> 11:27.424
Norman, one of these days you're
gonna surprise me with a new line.

11:33.897 --> 11:36.525
Hey! What?!

11:36.600 --> 11:39.557
"Stop now! You're being
tracked by Electroguard."

11:39.603 --> 11:42.094
What the hell is
Electroguard?

11:52.349 --> 11:55.182
The guy's a goddamn genius.
Right into the tunnel.

11:57.521 --> 11:58.628
I'll call Jersey.

12:12.283 --> 12:15.417
"This tunnel was drawn up
by Edward Trammel in 1918

12:15.417 --> 12:17.430
on a napkin
in a Manhattan tavern.

12:19.759 --> 12:19.759
Work on the tunnel
began in 1921,

12:19.759 --> 12:22.970
employing thousands of Irish immigrants
nicknamed 'sandhogs'.

12:22.970 --> 12:26.813
The tunnel, which runs under 24 feet
of riverbed and 72 feet of water..."

12:26.813 --> 12:30.520
Hey, dad? How many vacations
did you take Linda on?

12:30.520 --> 12:32.360
Ashley, that's enough!

12:32.360 --> 12:35.089
Honey, listen.
Linda's history.

12:35.159 --> 12:37.490
We're a family again.
That's all that counts.

12:43.175 --> 12:44.262
Christ!

12:53.629 --> 12:57.007
What the hell is that?
Oh, we got a live one here.

12:57.007 --> 12:57.963
Get a crew ready.

12:57.963 --> 13:00.661
All Jersey units,
requesting north tube roadblock.

13:00.731 --> 13:02.754
Black Cadillac now passing
through station number...

13:02.754 --> 13:05.041
Oh, I want you, putz!

13:07.724 --> 13:10.529
What'd we get? Come on.
What'd we get? In there!

13:14.596 --> 13:16.829
That's a big one!

13:25.542 --> 13:26.825
Move it, jerk!

13:32.082 --> 13:35.355
- Oh!
- You stupid bitch! You stu... Pick 'em up!

13:36.522 --> 13:38.250
- Oh, look what you did!
- Shit!

13:39.934 --> 13:41.535
Now it's your fault!

13:57.107 --> 14:01.562
Heidi, it's helicopter skiing.
Think of it as a... cordless chair lift.

14:08.452 --> 14:11.546
Breaker, breaker!
We got a smoker! We got a smoker!

14:16.420 --> 14:17.893
Up yours, buddy!

14:38.982 --> 14:40.693
Pass him, man!

14:41.151 --> 14:42.778
- Pass!
- Take 'em!

14:50.494 --> 14:52.485
- Get off my leg!
- I can't!

14:55.465 --> 14:56.986
No!

15:26.229 --> 15:28.789
Jesus Christ!

15:32.569 --> 15:34.400
Here I am in the tunnel.

17:11.968 --> 17:13.660
You're doctors!
Come on!

17:15.806 --> 17:17.553
Get down! Get down!
Somebody get him down!

17:17.553 --> 17:18.953
Get him on the ground!

17:23.814 --> 17:25.252
Down!

17:28.831 --> 17:30.930
Roll! Roll!
Roll! Roll!

17:31.688 --> 17:32.585
Roll!

17:35.092 --> 17:36.402
Get over here!

17:43.677 --> 17:45.966
I got 'im! I got 'im!

17:46.424 --> 17:49.437
- We're gonna need some C-collars!
- Shit!

17:49.506 --> 17:51.620
Let me see that arm.
Fine, look, you're gonna be okay.

17:51.620 --> 17:53.813
Keep going. There's emergency
workers that way. Keep moving.

17:53.814 --> 17:54.477
Keep going!

17:54.477 --> 17:56.080
My father,
he's trapped in the car!

17:56.080 --> 17:58.503
I can't get him out!
There's blood everywhere!

17:58.503 --> 17:59.718
Can you help him out?

17:59.833 --> 18:00.447
Help!

18:00.447 --> 18:03.815
We're comin' for you. We'll get you.
Don't worry about it. We're gonna get you.

18:04.638 --> 18:05.773
Look at me. Look at me.

18:06.625 --> 18:08.485
I'm gonna try to move you
on the count of three all right?

18:08.485 --> 18:09.873
I want you
to help me out. Ready?

18:10.026 --> 18:12.566
Okay. One, two...

18:20.240 --> 18:22.026
- Fine. What's your name ?
- Susan.

18:22.405 --> 18:24.748
- It'll be okay.
- He's severed an artery.

18:25.005 --> 18:27.973
I'm gonna tie this off, and I want you
to hold it as tight as you can.

18:28.044 --> 18:29.521
- You got that?
- Yeah.

18:35.153 --> 18:37.352
- All right, how is he?
- He's dead.

18:37.420 --> 18:40.087
I got a second-degree burn
over there. Get to it, okay?

18:40.087 --> 18:42.889
You, listen. I got an arterial bleeder
that needs an I.V. Move it, move it.

18:42.924 --> 18:45.089
- What are you still doin' here?
- I thought you were a cab driver.

18:45.089 --> 18:46.945
I am a driver.
Come on. Move, move!

18:47.230 --> 18:48.805
- Give me a B.P. cuff.
- Sure, I got it!

18:53.670 --> 18:55.729
Latura.

18:55.806 --> 18:57.738
Jesus Christ.
Latura!

18:57.972 --> 18:58.938
Weller, right?

18:58.938 --> 19:00.961
Get the hell outta here
before somebody sees you!

19:00.961 --> 19:01.909
What was it, a bomb?

19:01.909 --> 19:04.555
Accident, something about
a toxic dump. But nothing's confirmed.

19:04.555 --> 19:05.959
All right. What's the status
on the Jersey side?

19:05.959 --> 19:08.041
Oh, man,
it's sealed up tight.

19:08.041 --> 19:09.798
It's a wipeout clear up
to the tollbooths.

19:09.798 --> 19:10.875
Where the hell's the chief?

19:11.054 --> 19:13.025
Standin' right in front of me,
as far as I'm concerned.

19:13.025 --> 19:14.349
I'm talkin' about
the new chief. Where's he?

19:14.349 --> 19:16.356
The dispatcher said
Mr. California's headed

19:16.356 --> 19:18.196
for the mid-river passage
in the south tunnel.

19:19.293 --> 19:20.630
- Mid-river?
- Yeah.

19:22.318 --> 19:24.821
Hey, Latura,
watch your back.

19:32.349 --> 19:34.809
George!
George, come in, please!

19:34.809 --> 19:37.027
Are you there?
This is Grace. George!

19:37.647 --> 19:39.790
Oh, God, please be there,
please be there, please...

19:40.620 --> 19:41.917
George, come in.

19:41.985 --> 19:43.611
George, are you there?
George!

20:03.201 --> 20:05.794
Can anybody
hear me out there? Come back.

20:07.827 --> 20:11.219
We got a toxic fire. It's burning
toward the New Jersey side.

20:11.815 --> 20:13.997
Can anybody hear me?

20:15.218 --> 20:19.799
The ventilation system... doesn't seem
to be pulling the smoke through.

20:20.123 --> 20:22.029
Is anybody out there?
Come back!

20:22.299 --> 20:26.141
The New Jersey side
has completely collapsed!

20:27.765 --> 20:29.582
Oh, God, Jesus!

20:29.966 --> 20:32.359
Oh, God, we got
fatalities down here!

20:32.359 --> 20:34.739
Can anybody hear me?!

21:25.722 --> 21:27.592
Hey, you can't go
in there!

21:45.609 --> 21:48.198
No, no, no, no, no!
We're working the mid-river!

21:48.198 --> 21:51.031
We got some wormholes here.
We'll find a way through.

21:51.154 --> 21:53.770
- It will work in the mid-river!
- Thompson needs you!

21:53.770 --> 21:56.018
- What?
- Thompson!

21:56.086 --> 21:58.179
- Stand by. I'll be with you in a second.
- Okay.

21:58.254 --> 22:00.502
What's the ratio? Yeah.

22:00.502 --> 22:03.005
Frank, you got any hope
on the New Jersey side?

22:03.193 --> 22:05.252
Fifty-yard cave-in,
minimum.

22:05.328 --> 22:08.690
Whatever's burning in there
is toxic as Trenton. They got samples.

22:09.566 --> 22:12.928
Demo! Demo!
Come on, people, speak to me!

22:13.192 --> 22:14.410
Give me
another reading, Bob.

22:14.410 --> 22:16.045
I would if I had time,
but we're running out of it.

22:16.046 --> 22:16.942
Let's go!

22:17.546 --> 22:20.367
If you wanna buy some time,
you gotta blow the tunnel shut.

22:20.801 --> 22:23.845
- What are you doin' here, Kit?
- You're not part of this.

22:23.845 --> 22:25.934
I know that, I know that,
but just listen to me.

22:26.182 --> 22:28.390
We ran a terrorist hypothetical
in '94.

22:28.458 --> 22:30.673
The only way to fix the fire there
is to blow the roof in

22:30.673 --> 22:32.700
and seal all of the survivors
from the fumes.

22:32.700 --> 22:35.153
Well, where I come from,
we don't blow up a tunnel

22:35.153 --> 22:37.349
that's already been blown up,
but thanks for your input.

22:37.494 --> 22:40.554
- Chief wants to go through mid-river, Kit.
- No, no, wait, wait a minute.

22:40.630 --> 22:44.372
Frank, you don't have to
rationalize my actions to this guy!

22:44.372 --> 22:47.303
Look. I know you know your job,
but we did a simulation.

22:47.303 --> 22:49.034
You'll all be dead
before you get through. Dead.

22:49.159 --> 22:52.071
Look. I know you ran
a drill in '94, but right now

22:52.071 --> 22:54.130
you're not running
a goddamn thing.

22:54.130 --> 22:55.147
Copy that.

22:56.229 --> 22:58.604
You're right. I know that.
I... I just wanna help.

22:58.604 --> 23:00.453
Help? You don't get it,
do you?

23:00.850 --> 23:03.429
You don't work here anymore.
You understand that?

23:04.241 --> 23:05.614
- All right.
- Wilson, if I could just talk...

23:05.688 --> 23:08.225
Come on. Come on, Kit.
He's gonna have you arrested!

23:08.225 --> 23:11.154
Look. You gotta blow
the tunnel shut. Talk to 'im.

23:11.823 --> 23:14.504
You owe me that, Frank.
Talk to 'im.

23:16.430 --> 23:17.970
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

23:18.495 --> 23:21.281
<i>We've decided to evacuate
the south tube.</i>

23:21.738 --> 23:25.272
<i>Please collect your valuables,
lock your cars...</i>

23:25.442 --> 23:29.196
<i>and proceed in an orderly fashion
back to New Jersey.</i>

23:44.964 --> 23:45.966
What do you got?

23:46.772 --> 23:49.491
Sorry, chief.
It's blocked about 20 feet in.

23:49.491 --> 23:52.274
That structure's so shaky,
I wouldn't even risk a firecracker.

23:52.274 --> 23:54.192
What about hydraulics?
We brace up as we go.

23:54.192 --> 23:54.806
It can't be done!

23:54.806 --> 23:56.856
Listen. The person who says
it can't be done

23:56.856 --> 23:59.714
is always interrupted
by the one who just did it!

24:02.245 --> 24:03.736
Feed him the line!

24:08.687 --> 24:10.064
Wilson!

24:10.653 --> 24:13.754
Jesus Christ!
Wilson!

24:14.324 --> 24:16.950
Watch it, watch it.
Watch the metal. It's hot.

24:22.832 --> 24:25.639
What are you doing ?
Ashley, no, this way.

24:25.639 --> 24:29.631
No, no, no, Ashley. Ashley,
you don't have to take pictures now.

24:31.374 --> 24:34.648
- Ashley, look at me. Look, honey.
- It's okay.

24:34.648 --> 24:36.971
I won't let you down.
We're gonna get out of here.

24:37.058 --> 24:40.167
- Hey! Hey!
- What's happened?

24:40.167 --> 24:43.015
I don't know.
You're alive. You're still alive.

24:44.077 --> 24:45.727
I'm gonna go on up
through the tunnel.

24:45.788 --> 24:46.952
Stay right here
with your family

24:46.952 --> 24:48.646
so I'll know where you are
when I come back for you.

24:48.646 --> 24:50.939
- How do we get out of here?
- I don't know, it's sealed at both ends.

25:01.204 --> 25:02.399
Jonno?

25:16.419 --> 25:18.027
Jonno!

25:20.790 --> 25:23.521
Oh, shit!

25:33.069 --> 25:35.159
- Hey, officer, over here.
- Hey!

25:35.531 --> 25:37.143
You raise anybody
on that walkie?

25:37.178 --> 25:38.889
No, nothin' but static.
But you got a phone!

25:38.889 --> 25:41.120
Nah, nah. 2,000 dollars.
It doesn't even work in here.

25:41.120 --> 25:42.332
"Territory Beyond."

25:42.332 --> 25:43.958
- Man, I know you.
- Roy Nord.

25:43.958 --> 25:45.098
- Roy Nord...
- How you doin'?

25:45.098 --> 25:47.565
George Tyrell.
I got a pair of your shoes.

25:47.884 --> 25:50.876
- Good, good. You like 'em?
- Yeah, man, they're great!

25:50.954 --> 25:52.940
I wear 'em on Saturdays
on my day off.

25:52.940 --> 25:54.650
Bet you wish
it was Saturday now, huh?

25:54.650 --> 25:56.239
- Yeah.
- Liste, what are we gonna do?

25:56.326 --> 25:57.977
Is there a way
out of this mess or what?

25:58.494 --> 26:01.128
There was a passage to the south tunnel
about a half mile back.

26:01.555 --> 26:02.797
You check it out?

26:02.797 --> 26:05.347
Course I checked it out!
It's all... it's all collapsed.

26:05.608 --> 26:07.310
Well, think I'll take a look.

26:07.310 --> 26:08.562
What do you mean
you're gonna take a look?

26:08.562 --> 26:11.217
I just told you it was collapsed, man.
You'd be wasting your time.

26:11.217 --> 26:14.023
It's all blocked in.
There's no way out!

26:14.023 --> 26:17.370
George, I was born
six weeks premature.

26:17.714 --> 26:19.804
My own mother
couldn't keep me in.

26:33.463 --> 26:34.479
Eleanor.

26:41.170 --> 26:42.606
Oh, my God!

26:44.277 --> 26:45.646
Are you people okay?

26:46.209 --> 26:50.145
Yes, we're fine. We're fine.
Thank you for asking.

26:50.213 --> 26:52.583
- How do you get out of here ?
- I'm still tryin' to get information.

26:52.583 --> 26:53.107
Cooper.

26:53.344 --> 26:55.209
Cooper... Who's Cooper?
What's he look like?

26:55.209 --> 26:56.677
There he is !
He's all right.

26:58.230 --> 27:01.241
No, no, no, darling. No, no, no, no.
Come on. I'll... I'll get him.

28:06.789 --> 28:09.779
Lady, get to the front of the bus!
The key is in the ignition.

28:09.779 --> 28:11.123
Okay.

28:27.191 --> 28:31.164
Hey, break this down. Come on!
You gotta break it!

28:31.297 --> 28:33.144
Hey, hurry up!

28:40.234 --> 28:41.491
Hurry up!

28:42.630 --> 28:44.242
Come on, come on!
Hurry up!

28:45.695 --> 28:48.630
- Help!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

28:48.698 --> 28:52.361
- Get the key over here !
- I'm gonna try to find you some help.

28:52.435 --> 28:55.268
Help? You are help!
You are our help!

28:55.338 --> 28:59.035
N-no, n-no,
I'm just me.

29:06.487 --> 29:10.403
- The key's in the ignition!
- Lady, lady, please, the keys!

29:10.403 --> 29:12.018
The keys are
in the ignition!

29:12.018 --> 29:14.213
Hurry up! Come on!

29:15.993 --> 29:17.441
Hurry up, hurry up.

29:17.894 --> 29:20.435
- That one right here! Right here!
- Go, go, go, go!

29:23.466 --> 29:27.232
Did it! Hurry up!
All right, man!

29:31.403 --> 29:34.198
- You okay? You all right?
- My hero!

29:40.049 --> 29:41.566
Thanks, lady.

29:55.776 --> 29:56.728
What about him?

29:56.728 --> 30:00.159
That boy havin' a crack attack.
You might as well leave him alone.

30:00.159 --> 30:00.892
Come on, help me.

30:00.892 --> 30:03.395
Yo, help yourself, lady!
Look, I'm tellin'...

30:03.395 --> 30:06.940
No, I'm telling you!
We are not leaving him here!

30:10.028 --> 30:14.422
Okay, uh, uh,
what's your name?

30:14.833 --> 30:16.009
Mikey.

30:17.420 --> 30:21.823
I'm like... I'm like...
Like scared, okay?

30:21.891 --> 30:23.887
Yeah, I know, I know,
Mikey, I'm scared too,

30:23.887 --> 30:27.178
but-but-but I'd feel so much better
if you were out here with me.

30:28.030 --> 30:29.793
No, no, no, no, no!

30:29.866 --> 30:31.804
Okay, okay.

30:32.219 --> 30:34.027
Okay, uh...

30:34.681 --> 30:36.112
Hey, Mikey.

30:37.731 --> 30:40.033
Okay, uh,

30:40.888 --> 30:45.032
uh, hey, Mikey,
you think we're pretty?

30:48.282 --> 30:49.290
Yeah. So?

30:49.290 --> 30:52.360
So, wouldn't you rather be
out there with a couple of pretty girls

30:52.360 --> 30:54.155
than in here
trapped by yourself?

30:54.878 --> 30:56.662
Oh, God!

30:58.642 --> 31:00.789
Oh, shit!
Hey, yo, Mikey!

31:00.834 --> 31:02.862
We are all scared!

31:03.099 --> 31:06.205
Now get your crack-sucking
skinny ass out that window!

31:06.205 --> 31:10.421
- Now!
- Okay! Okay!

31:11.278 --> 31:13.517
Okay. Okay.

31:13.910 --> 31:16.272
You gotta get noisy
with these kids!

31:20.220 --> 31:22.570
Hey, girl! Hey, girl,
you listen to me!

31:22.785 --> 31:24.420
Jump now! Jump!

31:27.652 --> 31:30.097
Come on. Get up!
Let's get you outta here.

31:30.097 --> 31:33.622
That's gas under the bus! Gas!
Hey, lady, get the hell outta there!

31:33.696 --> 31:35.567
You take care of her.
I don't want any trouble outta you two.

31:35.567 --> 31:37.167
No trouble, man.

31:44.919 --> 31:49.877
Baby, are you in there?
Uh, I need you to cut the power.

31:50.846 --> 31:53.488
How do I say "cut the power"?
Cut the power.

32:02.892 --> 32:05.486
Lightning, what do you do?
What do you do?

32:05.561 --> 32:07.620
You get under a tree.
No, shit!

32:07.697 --> 32:09.961
You, uh...
you get back in the car.

32:10.032 --> 32:14.935
Right? Cause, cause,
cause tires are... rubber.

32:15.237 --> 32:16.731
What? The what?

32:17.826 --> 32:18.955
What are you doing?

32:19.675 --> 32:21.584
What are you doing?
No, wait, wait, wait!

32:21.584 --> 32:22.942
What are you...
what are you doing? Wait. No!

32:23.330 --> 32:26.337
- What are you doing?
- This. It should hold on.

32:26.798 --> 32:28.772
No! Wait a minute!

32:32.352 --> 32:33.763
Oh, my God!

32:36.850 --> 32:40.740
Cut the power. Cut the power!
Cut... the power.

32:52.768 --> 32:54.615
Anybody watching
these monitors?

32:54.948 --> 32:56.598
Oh, my God! Norman!

32:56.598 --> 32:58.868
Norman, it's George!
He's alive!

32:59.715 --> 33:01.580
Cut the power, baby!

33:01.651 --> 33:04.913
Down here! Move!
Down here! Yes!

33:11.584 --> 33:14.160
- Mikey, go!
- Something must be done!

33:14.230 --> 33:17.403
- No, you're not doing it.
- Live! Live!

33:17.700 --> 33:19.686
Cut the power. Come on,
baby, cut the power!

33:19.686 --> 33:21.781
Cut the power.
You gotta cut the power.

33:21.781 --> 33:24.080
I can't. That would shut down
the exhaust fans.

33:24.080 --> 33:27.446
- Those fans are on a separate system.
- Hey, who the hell are you?

33:27.643 --> 33:30.187
- Please, go!
- Wait, lady! Wait!

33:30.187 --> 33:31.594
Mikey, go!

33:32.580 --> 33:35.438
Just go, Mikey!

33:35.484 --> 33:38.445
Oh, don't splash!
Don't splash! Don't splash!

33:38.454 --> 33:40.537
If you don't cut the power right now,
that woman's dead.

33:43.308 --> 33:44.437
- Go!
- Jump!

33:47.229 --> 33:48.927
Cut the goddamn power!

33:51.467 --> 33:52.294
Jump!

33:54.075 --> 33:54.870
Cut the god...

34:02.354 --> 34:04.960
- Yes! Yes!
- You did it.

34:11.975 --> 34:13.420
Now, who the hell
are you?

34:13.420 --> 34:16.396
We met a couple o' years ago. I did
a terrorist hypothetical here in '94.

34:16.396 --> 34:19.378
Oh, yeah, La-La-Latura. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You were canned in '95.

34:19.378 --> 34:21.627
I mean, you're back with the
Emergency Medical Service?

34:21.627 --> 34:23.719
No, not exactly.
How's the monoxide level?

34:23.719 --> 34:26.315
Hey, wait a second! You've got
no authority to come in here!

34:26.315 --> 34:27.791
No, I don't,
but when we did the hypothetical

34:27.791 --> 34:29.252
I crawled through
every hidden part of that structure.

34:29.252 --> 34:31.665
Right now I might be of some use,
so... how's the air?

34:31.665 --> 34:34.339
I-it's changing at a rate
of about a million cubic feet an hour.

34:34.409 --> 34:36.862
That's one-twentieth normal,
and it's getting worse!

34:37.483 --> 34:38.851
Oh, great, it's here.

34:51.750 --> 34:53.011
Look at this thing.

34:53.362 --> 34:56.531
When they glued this together,
they were still fighting World War I.

34:56.966 --> 34:58.088
Okay, anyway,

34:59.274 --> 35:01.804
here's the north tube,
south tube,

35:02.847 --> 35:06.387
river, the riverbed,
here's the tunnel:

35:06.693 --> 35:09.369
a rectangle
set inside each tube. Hm?

35:09.900 --> 35:11.555
Now, what's this?
I don't recognize this.

35:11.555 --> 35:13.171
Oh, hey, yeah, yeah,
that's...

35:13.301 --> 35:16.244
The sandhogs worked 36-hour shifts
building this thing

35:16.244 --> 35:19.423
and they had bunk rooms there,
they had chapels, kitchens

35:19.423 --> 35:20.363
and everything down there.

35:20.363 --> 35:23.690
But... it was all sealed off
in the renovation of '72.

35:23.759 --> 35:26.236
Hmm. Hey, Frank!

35:26.455 --> 35:29.289
Did Wilson give an estimate
when he'd get to the mid-river passage?

35:29.431 --> 35:30.954
Nothin' that he can share, Kit.

35:30.954 --> 35:34.434
We had another collapse 20 minutes ago.
Mr. California got pancaked.

35:39.498 --> 35:40.901
So, what are we lookin' at?

35:40.901 --> 35:43.139
We don't know
the stress points in the mid-river.

35:43.813 --> 35:45.887
We can't risk any explosives.

35:46.282 --> 35:49.455
- It's all gotta be done by hand.
- That's gonna take forever.

35:49.455 --> 35:52.884
If another shaft don't give,
10, 12 hours, minimum.

35:52.955 --> 35:55.264
- How long's the air gonna hold?
- Three hours, max.

35:55.859 --> 35:58.957
Three hours, max... All right, Frank,
here's what I think we oughta do.

35:59.028 --> 36:01.408
I think we gotta cork it up and
seal off the survivors from the fumes

36:01.408 --> 36:03.801
until you can dig out the mid-river
passage. What do you think?

36:06.268 --> 36:08.971
Frank, are you
the acting chief or what?

36:08.971 --> 36:12.191
- Yeah, Kit, I'm the acting chief.
- So why don't you act?

36:13.818 --> 36:15.008
What are you tryin'...?
What do you... what do you do?

36:15.281 --> 36:16.621
What are you doin', Frank?
What do you wanna do?

36:16.621 --> 36:19.171
Nothing, so you'll be held blameless
in case you have to testify later on?

36:19.172 --> 36:19.775
Is that it?

36:19.775 --> 36:22.543
Don't pull that on me, Kit, okay?
That's past history.

36:22.543 --> 36:23.971
This got nothin' to do
with this situation.

36:23.971 --> 36:26.124
Now, you're wrong about that.
I had to take a chance. Now you do.

36:26.124 --> 36:28.654
I was in the same situation as you.
Now, what are you gonna do, Frank?

36:28.724 --> 36:30.809
There's nothin' to think about it.
It's three hours.

36:31.211 --> 36:32.612
It's three hours.

36:34.249 --> 36:35.396
You wanna go in, Kit?

36:44.340 --> 36:45.907
Give me clearance.

36:45.980 --> 36:50.905
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That tunnel is sealed from both ends.

36:51.262 --> 36:55.210
I mean, the mid-river here
is like hanging, like-like-like pick-up sticks.

36:55.483 --> 36:57.303
Now, what the hell's
the way in, huh?

37:01.690 --> 37:02.906
Here.

37:09.298 --> 37:12.946
<i>Uh, this is Engine Seven,
ETA about five minutes.</i>

37:13.802 --> 37:16.364
There are four of those.

37:16.438 --> 37:18.679
We can shut them down
for two-and-a-half minutes.

37:18.679 --> 37:19.313
Each?

37:19.313 --> 37:21.258
Total. They're revved
all the way up

37:21.258 --> 37:23.274
to compensate for
the damaged exhaust shaft.

37:23.274 --> 37:26.098
When we shut them down,
it'll severely cut their oxygen.

37:26.098 --> 37:27.483
When the level gets too low,

37:27.483 --> 37:30.232
the computer automatically
kicks the fans back on.

37:30.232 --> 37:33.998
There's no override and
there's no second shutdown!

37:33.998 --> 37:37.779
- That's a safety feature.
- Anything else I should know?

37:37.842 --> 37:38.814
There are more problems.

37:38.814 --> 37:41.519
You don't come out above the
roadway, you come out under it.

37:41.697 --> 37:44.074
Norman, what's the combined force
of all the fans?

37:44.074 --> 37:47.081
- About 160 miles an hour.
- Great.

37:47.253 --> 37:49.863
- Frank, where's the demo team?
- On the way!

37:53.142 --> 37:55.004
All right, listen up, please.

37:55.636 --> 37:57.818
I wanna go over
a couple of things.

37:59.715 --> 38:02.332
- You got tape in that camera?
- Yeah.

38:02.584 --> 38:04.169
Get over there,
start shooting.

38:04.715 --> 38:07.068
World's gonna wanna
know how we did this.

38:07.089 --> 38:10.585
- New York City: the Territory Beyond!
- It's still out there!

38:10.586 --> 38:11.594
Exactly.

38:11.629 --> 38:13.373
Are you sayin'
you've found a way out of here?

38:13.670 --> 38:16.293
Not yet. If you wanna get
your hopes up, go ahead.

38:16.293 --> 38:18.085
A little hope
never hurt anybody.

38:19.313 --> 38:21.181
I will tell you
this passage,

38:21.181 --> 38:25.752
which, uh, George tells me leads to
the south tunnel, has some wormholes.

38:25.752 --> 38:30.608
I'm gonna go in and see if they add up
to a way out. So if you pray, pray.

38:30.608 --> 38:34.206
If you don't, it might be
a good time to take it up.

38:36.418 --> 38:39.478
I promise you this,
though... Miss?

38:39.555 --> 38:41.586
- Huh?
- Right here.

38:42.358 --> 38:44.493
- All the way.
- Okay. Okay.

38:44.493 --> 38:45.756
- You got me?
- Yeah.

38:48.230 --> 38:49.728
I promise you this:

38:49.946 --> 38:53.411
If there is a way out,
I'll find it.

38:58.807 --> 39:01.363
Okay, hold on to that.
We're gonna make it.

39:02.211 --> 39:05.058
- I'll be back soon.
- Yes, sir, we'll be waiting!

39:07.201 --> 39:11.457
Listen. I'm gonna make one last sweep
of this tunnel, just in case he's right.

39:11.457 --> 39:14.757
You keep trying to get somebody on
the other end of this thing. Take it.

39:17.860 --> 39:19.388
Hello?

39:19.928 --> 39:21.888
Need a refresher
on that Semtex procedure?

39:21.888 --> 39:25.656
- Set, wire, contact, run like hell.
- That's pretty much it, chief.

39:25.656 --> 39:28.200
<i>Can anyone hear me?
Hello!</i>

39:28.604 --> 39:30.561
I hear you.
Frank, got 'em!

39:31.456 --> 39:32.643
<i>You can hear me?</i>

39:32.908 --> 39:34.686
God! George! George!

39:34.810 --> 39:38.199
Okay, now, talk to me. How many
people are left alive down there?

39:38.313 --> 39:41.884
There's, uh, maybe a dozen, and, uh,
we're in the middle of the tunnel

39:41.884 --> 39:45.447
and... there's a-a man who-who thinks
he-he knows the way out.

39:45.689 --> 39:46.275
How?

39:46.275 --> 39:49.023
Uh, something about
a mid-river passage?

39:49.023 --> 39:51.269
No, no, no. No.
Listen to me.

39:51.827 --> 39:54.386
Tell them not to go in there.
Tell them we're coming down right now.

39:54.386 --> 39:55.143
Can you do that?

39:55.143 --> 39:58.256
- I can't hear you.
- Come in. Can you do that?

39:58.333 --> 40:01.084
- Hello!
- Shh! We lost 'em. Come on, Frank.

40:01.084 --> 40:02.859
Now, remember.
You got two-and-a-half minutes.

40:02.859 --> 40:04.606
The fans are timed
logarithmically.

40:04.606 --> 40:06.372
Fan one kicks on
after one minute,

40:06.372 --> 40:09.237
the remaining three
in sub-15 second intervals.

40:09.237 --> 40:11.270
- You follow me?
- I got it.

40:12.948 --> 40:15.872
There's a guy down there
named George Tyrell.

40:16.218 --> 40:18.585
You tell 'im
I want my bracelet back.

40:20.812 --> 40:22.528
Ready to shut down.

40:34.594 --> 40:39.154
Kit, what I did, I did
for the good of the department.

40:39.341 --> 40:40.418
It wasn't personal.

40:41.910 --> 40:44.597
He was your brother, Frank.
It doesn't get more personal.

40:45.247 --> 40:47.760
I was angry. I'm sorry.

40:47.760 --> 40:49.704
Hey, don't apologize.

40:50.063 --> 40:52.396
You make me feel like
you don't think I'm comin' back.

40:53.760 --> 40:55.405
You're probably right.

40:56.023 --> 41:00.135
- Let's do it!
- Norman, now!

41:00.135 --> 41:02.189
Fan one down,
fan two down,

41:02.264 --> 41:05.042
fan three down,
fan four comin' down.

41:05.267 --> 41:07.019
All fans down!

41:08.137 --> 41:10.127
Go, Latura, go.

41:12.363 --> 41:14.803
It's not stopping!
It's not slowing down, Grace!

41:14.803 --> 41:16.133
The brake! Hit the brake!

41:16.133 --> 41:18.991
There are no brakes!
It's going on its own momentum!

41:18.991 --> 41:20.365
You've got to stop it!

41:26.981 --> 41:27.937
Frank!

41:34.563 --> 41:37.245
Pull against it!
Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull!

41:37.245 --> 41:39.295
You got it, you got it!
It's stubborn! Pull!

41:39.569 --> 41:40.653
- I got it!
- Just a little bit more!

41:42.371 --> 41:45.200
You got it! Take it out!

42:29.651 --> 42:32.611
<i>Hello?
Can you hear me?</i>

42:32.611 --> 42:35.112
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you.
- Hello?

42:35.112 --> 42:37.400
<i>Are you coming down?
How are you doing?</i>

42:37.400 --> 42:38.469
I'm all right.

42:38.928 --> 42:42.939
<i>I-I-I just thought you should know
that-that the man has gone through.</i>

42:43.676 --> 42:45.540
Really? Where?

42:46.179 --> 42:48.988
He's... Hello?

46:44.406 --> 46:46.276
I've seen worse.

47:07.195 --> 47:08.790
Oh, we're saved!

47:17.048 --> 47:18.830
Did you guys
stop for coffee?

47:19.307 --> 47:22.101
It's a rescue team!
We're out! I can't believe it.

47:22.344 --> 47:23.708
Where are the rest?

47:24.412 --> 47:26.459
- There is no rest!
- You're joking.

47:26.459 --> 47:29.606
- Aw, come on, man, come on!
- He can't be the only one.

47:29.818 --> 47:31.252
There has to be
some more!

47:33.134 --> 47:35.755
- Are some more comin' or what?
- Shit!

47:35.824 --> 47:37.780
- Tell me this is not happening.
- Are we gonna get out?

47:38.793 --> 47:42.051
- Oh, man, this can't be right!
- Where's the team?

47:42.051 --> 47:44.205
He's it? You're it?

47:44.685 --> 47:46.599
- You are it?
- Yeah, I'm it.

47:46.599 --> 47:48.440
You're the woman
with the walkie-talkie?

47:48.440 --> 47:49.533
You're the man
with the walkie-talkie?

47:49.533 --> 47:51.851
Yeah. I thought I was clear.
No one was supposed to go in there.

47:51.851 --> 47:54.901
- Well, excuse me, it was a lousy connection!
- How many people are in there?

47:54.901 --> 47:56.935
- Well, there's only just one...
- Look, bitch, he's talkin' to me!

47:56.935 --> 47:57.706
Who are you?

47:57.706 --> 47:59.857
My name's Latura.
Now, who's in there?

48:00.097 --> 48:02.642
There's one man in there,
and it's Roy Nord himself.

48:03.618 --> 48:05.730
All right, look. That shaft's
unstable. We gotta get 'im.

48:06.121 --> 48:07.774
What you up to, man?
I'm in charge!

48:08.741 --> 48:13.412
Fine. If you wanna be in charge, fine.
But that shaft's been compromised.

48:13.412 --> 48:14.544
Anybody's trying
to get through that,

48:14.544 --> 48:15.665
the whole thing's gonna
come down on you.

48:15.666 --> 48:16.667
- We'll bring up the speed...
- No.

48:16.667 --> 48:18.159
It's not exactly safe
in here, either!

48:18.333 --> 48:21.085
We can't even breathe, man!
We gotta get outta here now!

48:21.168 --> 48:23.548
All right, I-I know you've been
through hell down here, I can see that,

48:23.548 --> 48:25.938
but I'm just asking you
to... be patient...

48:26.097 --> 48:28.733
a little bit longer, okay,
and just trust me, okay?

48:28.767 --> 48:30.636
Then get us out. What the hell
are we waiting around here for?

48:30.636 --> 48:31.696
We'll go out
the same way you came in.

48:31.696 --> 48:34.089
- That's not possible.
- If you made it, we can make it.

48:34.089 --> 48:35.266
Just give us a chance, man!

48:36.051 --> 48:38.759
The fans are giving us the only air we got.
We shut 'em down, we're dead.

48:38.759 --> 48:40.744
That's it. That's a fact.

48:42.324 --> 48:45.157
That won't work.
Neither will this.

48:45.226 --> 48:47.918
- Roy's on top of it.
- Roy's gonna be under it.

48:48.096 --> 48:49.999
Now let me do what
I gotta do, all right?

48:52.015 --> 48:53.433
I told you,
I'm in charge here!

48:53.501 --> 48:55.992
I'm in charge!
You understand me?

48:56.071 --> 48:57.878
Let him go, now!

49:04.161 --> 49:05.637
Hello? Serena?

49:05.637 --> 49:08.375
Serena, Roy.
Actually, no.

49:08.516 --> 49:12.486
I'm afraid we ran into a little problem
on the way to the airport. Yeah, listen.

49:12.613 --> 49:14.557
Before we, uh,
before we get cut off,

49:14.557 --> 49:19.662
I'm gonna be leading some survivors
up through this ventilating shaft.

49:27.260 --> 49:32.207
Hold the plane at Teterboro
and, uh, I'll do press in Denver.

49:32.574 --> 49:34.416
Tell 'em I'll have
some videotape.

49:35.477 --> 49:38.047
No, no,
Jonno didn't make it.

49:38.346 --> 49:40.636
Yeah.
Listen, I gotta go.

49:45.414 --> 49:47.115
- Why don't you take this?
- Just keep it.

49:47.115 --> 49:48.820
- Take it, man!
- Try to get somebody on it.

49:49.336 --> 49:51.285
The battery's dead!
What's the point?

49:51.496 --> 49:53.766
- Don't give me any trouble!
- Trouble, man?

49:54.045 --> 49:55.149
We're just standing here,
Steven.

49:55.149 --> 49:57.471
Sarah, I know,
but we don't know if it's safe.

49:57.666 --> 49:59.479
- We can't just go in there.
- According to who?

50:01.703 --> 50:04.448
- Get that outta my face, please!
- I'm sorry...

50:06.179 --> 50:08.275
- Hey, where's he going?
- Hey!

50:12.380 --> 50:14.519
Get back here!
Get back here!

50:19.663 --> 50:22.569
Hey, hey, hey, now you all heard
what the man said!

50:22.697 --> 50:25.009
I heard Mr. Nord,
and I believe what he said!

50:25.009 --> 50:26.972
The women and children first,
that's how it's done.

50:26.972 --> 50:28.575
Man, you done this before,
man?

50:28.575 --> 50:30.224
She's a child,
and he needs that tape.

50:31.817 --> 50:33.836
I don't know any more
than you know!

50:55.115 --> 50:56.096
Nord?

50:56.259 --> 50:58.840
Nord!
Oh, there you are.

50:59.794 --> 51:02.818
Nord, you're
a tough man to find.

51:03.498 --> 51:06.661
My name is Latura, with E.M.S.
You gotta come down from there now.

51:06.735 --> 51:08.932
That sounds like an order,
Mr. Latura.

51:09.037 --> 51:11.403
You wanna give me an order?
Call my "800" number.

51:11.473 --> 51:14.135
No, no, seriously,
listen to me.

51:14.209 --> 51:15.575
You and I are gonna
crawl outta here together,

51:15.575 --> 51:18.672
so why don't you just come down
real slow-like, okay?

51:20.315 --> 51:23.876
There's no way through.
This... shaft is like a house of cards.

51:23.876 --> 51:26.385
If it collapses, they're gonna
be moppin' you up for a month.

51:26.454 --> 51:29.336
It's not going to collapse.
How do I know that?

51:29.336 --> 51:31.574
Because you don't achieve
what I have without an instinct

51:31.574 --> 51:34.128
for the torque of
a given situation. You understand?

51:34.521 --> 51:37.483
If you think I'm gonna... start
second-guessing myself now

51:37.483 --> 51:39.113
because of
some gutless paramedic,

51:39.113 --> 51:41.445
you'd better get a reality check.
And quit wasting my time.

51:41.445 --> 51:43.730
- You start sending those people in here.
- Nord!

51:43.731 --> 51:44.731
- Whose there?
- Nord, you gotta...

51:44.672 --> 51:46.049
It's a safe place.
Stay there!

51:46.049 --> 51:46.974
Get me outta here!
I'm ready to go!

51:46.974 --> 51:49.367
- Stay! That's it.
- Nord.

51:49.444 --> 51:50.574
Don't move, please.

51:51.515 --> 51:54.443
Nord...
I hope you make it.

51:54.818 --> 51:55.958
Get outta here!

51:56.445 --> 51:59.484
I always make it,
Mr. Latura.

52:21.543 --> 52:25.208
Move it!
Keep going!

52:26.981 --> 52:29.609
Faster! Faster!

52:32.253 --> 52:35.173
Don't look back!
Keep going!

52:38.237 --> 52:41.721
- It's caving in! It's caving in!
- You played me, fool man!

52:41.796 --> 52:42.882
Get down!

52:57.812 --> 53:00.007
All the D.T.A.'s
are pulling double shifts.

53:00.081 --> 53:03.073
I don't care if some guy's wife
is having a baby.

53:07.416 --> 53:09.982
Hey, quiet, everybody.
Everybody, quiet down.

53:10.058 --> 53:12.564
Hey, shut up!
Shut up, everybody!

53:14.429 --> 53:16.412
The mid-river
just went down.

53:22.503 --> 53:25.939
No, no, no, no, no!

53:27.290 --> 53:28.509
Mr. Latura!

53:32.356 --> 53:34.547
- Easy, easy.
- I'm gonna die, right?

53:35.463 --> 53:38.966
Don't talk, don't talk. Don't talk.
I need.... Give me a scarf.

53:39.352 --> 53:42.230
Please, I can't be goin' out
like this, man.

53:44.239 --> 53:46.118
I can't feel nothin'.
I can't feel nothin'.

53:46.497 --> 53:48.287
- Shh.
- I can't go out like this.

53:48.363 --> 53:51.764
That's right.
Don't talk.

53:52.710 --> 53:56.620
Tell my father... I was helping
people down here, all right?

53:57.080 --> 53:58.404
I'll find 'im.

53:58.806 --> 54:01.921
I'll tell your father
that you were a real hero.

54:03.035 --> 54:04.157
He won't...

54:05.519 --> 54:08.347
He won't...
He won't believe you.

55:07.208 --> 55:09.273
Oh, Christ!

55:10.009 --> 55:10.934
Oh!

55:14.093 --> 55:16.113
God,
this is too much.

55:49.716 --> 55:52.141
- Hey, stop him!
- Get off me!

55:52.141 --> 55:54.712
Let me go!
We're gonna drown!

55:54.712 --> 55:59.020
No, you're not gonna drown!
Listen to me!

55:59.394 --> 56:02.998
You're going the wrong way.
This entire tunnel runs downhill.

56:03.164 --> 56:05.759
The Manhattan end will be
the first place to fill up with water!

56:05.759 --> 56:09.030
He's right. Come on. Come on,
this way. It's higher. Come on!

56:10.038 --> 56:12.276
Excuse me. Excuse me!

56:12.755 --> 56:15.138
I don't know who you are and
what you know and what you don't.

56:15.209 --> 56:17.165
All I know is I've got
a 14-year-old daughter down here,

56:17.165 --> 56:18.688
and her life means
more to me than anything.

56:18.688 --> 56:20.809
So I wanna be involved in
any decisions that are made down here.

56:20.809 --> 56:22.059
Am I clear, Mr. Latura?

56:22.059 --> 56:25.319
- That's fair enough.
- Latura? Latura? I read about you.

56:25.386 --> 56:27.471
It was in all the papers.
Some kind of scandal?

56:27.471 --> 56:28.241
What kind of scandal?

56:28.241 --> 56:29.705
Not the kind that matters
down here. Come on!

56:29.705 --> 56:33.723
I beg to differ, Mr. Latura. Scandals
matter to Mrs. Trilling and myself.

56:34.757 --> 56:36.668
Excuse me, ma'am,
what kind of scandal?

56:36.668 --> 56:39.306
He was chief of
the Emergency Medical Service.

56:39.306 --> 56:42.076
Some people got killed,
and he was involved.

56:42.076 --> 56:43.093
That's all I remember.

56:43.093 --> 56:46.063
What? What about it, Latura?
Is that true?

56:47.523 --> 56:50.505
Look, pal, I asked you a question,
and I want to know the answer!

56:50.578 --> 56:53.678
- Is it true? Is that true?
- Hey! Hey!

56:53.748 --> 56:56.516
Let's remember that
he came down here to help us,

56:56.818 --> 57:00.239
so let's stop focusing on 'im
and focus on the problem!

57:01.297 --> 57:02.390
She's right.

57:02.690 --> 57:05.784
I'm sorry, Mr. Latura.
That was very rude.

57:05.860 --> 57:08.795
Rude? What is this, some kind
of goddamn New York country club?

57:08.863 --> 57:10.922
- Watch your mouth.
- You don't have a child down here!

57:10.998 --> 57:14.092
And his past may have
a great deal to do with our future!

57:14.168 --> 57:16.698
We're gonna drown down here,
and he's all we've got!

57:17.245 --> 57:20.505
If I'm all you've got, why don't you
meet me halfway? Is that fair enough?

57:20.505 --> 57:22.908
- Are we gonna drown?
- No.

57:23.077 --> 57:25.108
- What is your name?
- Ashley.

57:25.268 --> 57:27.873
Look, Ashley, there's still time
to stop the leak

57:27.873 --> 57:29.583
before it gets high enough
to worry about drowning.

57:29.583 --> 57:31.773
- That's the good news.
- What's the bad news?

57:33.303 --> 57:36.790
This water's 38 degrees. What we
have to worry about is hypothermia.

57:36.790 --> 57:39.054
- Hypo what?
- Hypothermia.

57:39.135 --> 57:41.324
Your body loses heat
and shuts down.

57:41.395 --> 57:42.448
You feel like
you're getting tired,

57:42.448 --> 57:44.281
but you're really getting dead.
That about right?

57:44.281 --> 57:45.480
But that's not gonna
happen to us,

57:45.480 --> 57:47.197
because we're gonna
look out for each other.

57:47.368 --> 57:50.153
We're gonna stay high and dry
right on this car dam over here,

57:50.153 --> 57:52.198
so everybody get
on the car dam. Come on.

57:52.476 --> 57:56.209
Get the hell outta this water.
Come on. Let's get outta the water.

58:01.057 --> 58:03.085
Excuse me, could you
please help me with the dog?

58:05.386 --> 58:06.656
Thanks very much.

58:07.555 --> 58:09.113
Here, boy. Come here.

58:15.675 --> 58:18.009
Okay, so here we are.
We're high and dry.

58:18.009 --> 58:19.790
So, what do you plan
on doing?

58:20.735 --> 58:21.762
In a situation like this,

58:21.762 --> 58:23.938
I think it's very very important
that everybody knows exactly

58:23.938 --> 58:25.705
what is happening.
Okay?

58:25.705 --> 58:28.040
The last thing we need
is any more surprises, right?

58:28.549 --> 58:29.498
Okay?

58:29.498 --> 58:31.916
What I'm gonna try to do
is collapse a section of that tube

58:31.916 --> 58:34.814
to seal us off from the fire
and try to plug that leak.

58:34.882 --> 58:38.477
- How do you plan to do that?
- I have to use an explosive.

58:38.553 --> 58:41.160
- Wait, please, let me explain!
- Another explosion?

58:41.270 --> 58:44.477
That's your idea down here?
No wonder you got people killed.

58:44.477 --> 58:45.493
Steven!

58:45.493 --> 58:48.582
If anyone has a better idea,
now is the time to tell me. Do you?

58:48.582 --> 58:51.898
You don't know what kind of damage
this substructure's already sustained,

58:51.966 --> 58:54.355
so how do you know you can
contain it to one section?

58:54.355 --> 58:56.424
I don't know!
I don't know anything!

58:56.424 --> 58:58.846
The only thing I know is
we're not gonna make it another hour

58:58.846 --> 59:00.421
unless I shut
this thing down!

59:00.795 --> 59:02.583
That I do know.

59:03.077 --> 59:05.629
Now, what we need is someone
to go to the Manhattan end

59:05.629 --> 59:07.756
to see if we're making
any progress, okay?

59:09.549 --> 59:10.709
How about you?

59:10.709 --> 59:13.422
No, you can't go, daddy!
Please, you can't go!

59:13.422 --> 59:17.170
- I've a family. I don't wanna leave 'em.
- But you're so good at it.

59:19.279 --> 59:20.791
All right, all right,
I'll go.

59:20.928 --> 59:23.361
- I know the place best, anyway.
- You're hired.

59:23.831 --> 59:25.399
She wants her bracelet back.

59:26.300 --> 59:28.345
- What?
- You're George, right?

59:28.345 --> 59:28.905
Yeah.

59:28.905 --> 59:30.886
Grace said to tell you
she wants her bracelet back.

59:31.046 --> 59:33.916
- She told you that?
- Good luck, man.

59:35.076 --> 59:37.301
She can't keep anything
to herself.

59:39.768 --> 59:42.406
Listen, you were the one
handling that live wire?

59:42.406 --> 59:45.076
Uh, yeah, but that was
a very different thing. I-I didn't know...

59:45.076 --> 59:46.819
I-I need your help
right now.

59:46.819 --> 59:48.369
I-I appreciate that,
I know that you mean well...

59:48.369 --> 59:51.917
Listen. It took a lot of guts
to do that. What's your name?

59:51.917 --> 59:52.917
Uh, Madelyne.

59:52.917 --> 59:54.812
Madelyne, I really need
your help, okay?

59:55.675 --> 59:57.739
Look at this.
Need a stress hold design.

59:57.849 --> 01:00:00.403
Better than we did
on Brooklyn-Queens.

01:00:00.403 --> 01:00:01.508
What do you think
we're gonna do here?

01:00:02.285 --> 01:00:03.745
Open it up.

01:00:04.205 --> 01:00:07.474
Open it up?
Let's open it up.

01:00:07.611 --> 01:00:10.612
Okay. Still not getting
any trace of them, am I right?

01:00:10.612 --> 01:00:12.230
There was a meltdown
on the phone lines.

01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:14.063
Walkie-talkies
have been known to go dead.

01:00:14.063 --> 01:00:16.247
Am I wrong in saying that
you don't really know

01:00:16.247 --> 01:00:18.859
whether there's anyone alive
to transmit, period?

01:00:18.859 --> 01:00:21.505
- We saw people!
- Hours ago.

01:00:21.505 --> 01:00:23.298
We're gonna break through from
the Manhattan side.

01:00:23.298 --> 01:00:25.457
That's the consensus
of the city engineers.

01:00:25.457 --> 01:00:27.473
- Consensus my ass!
- Who's this?

01:00:27.473 --> 01:00:29.886
That tunnel's being held up
by counterpoint pressure.

01:00:29.886 --> 01:00:31.338
I asked your name!

01:00:31.338 --> 01:00:32.978
Why don't you forget
what her name is?

01:00:32.978 --> 01:00:34.434
Listen to what
she's saying to you.

01:00:34.434 --> 01:00:36.627
Miss London,
if you bring in the heavy equipment,

01:00:36.627 --> 01:00:39.735
cause a pressure shift,
the whole damn thing could implode.

01:00:39.735 --> 01:00:43.083
- That's speculation.
- Maybe a little more time.

01:00:43.083 --> 01:00:48.574
We are time poor. That tunnel
is an artery. The city is bleeding.

01:00:48.928 --> 01:00:51.454
You try to redirect
half a million people

01:00:51.454 --> 01:00:53.548
in and out of this city
without that tunnel,

01:00:53.548 --> 01:00:55.467
you got a problem that
you don't wanna think about.

01:00:55.467 --> 01:00:57.480
What are you saying?
Are you saying that because

01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:00.789
of a traffic problem,
you're giving up on possible survivors?

01:01:00.789 --> 01:01:03.037
Come on, man.
You gotta hold off on the drill.

01:01:04.445 --> 01:01:07.395
Look, the city engineers
make the decisions.

01:01:08.773 --> 01:01:10.803
You clean up the mess.

01:01:13.652 --> 01:01:16.887
- You're doin' real good, Madelyne.
- Doin' real good? Try scared to death.

01:01:16.887 --> 01:01:18.289
Maybe,
but you're dealing with it.

01:01:18.289 --> 01:01:20.488
You know, I-I really think
you should get someone else.

01:01:20.488 --> 01:01:22.072
I mean, this is not
one of my specialties.

01:01:22.072 --> 01:01:24.823
No, no, no. Not a lot of people could
handle that cable the way you did.

01:01:24.823 --> 01:01:26.452
Well, it's not
like it had a lot of...

01:01:28.849 --> 01:01:30.762
- It's okay. It's okay.
- I can't. I can't.

01:01:30.762 --> 01:01:32.326
Fine, I know.
You have a choice.

01:01:33.224 --> 01:01:35.887
It's like the first person that
ever ate a raw oyster, you know that?

01:01:35.887 --> 01:01:37.449
- What are you talking about?
- Well, think about it.

01:01:37.954 --> 01:01:39.574
A person would have to be
starving to death

01:01:39.574 --> 01:01:41.676
to ever get involved
with a raw oyster, right?

01:01:41.676 --> 01:01:44.501
He probably had to eat it or die.
Now, stay with me, Madelyne.

01:01:44.501 --> 01:01:45.313
Fine. I am here.

01:01:45.313 --> 01:01:49.544
It was slimy. It smelled. It looked
like something out of a bad chest cold.

01:01:49.777 --> 01:01:50.986
So there had to be
that moment of truth

01:01:51.141 --> 01:01:53.384
before he sucked that
little slider down. Staying with me?

01:01:53.384 --> 01:01:54.180
I'm here.

01:01:54.180 --> 01:01:57.417
Think of that moment of truth.
"Do I really need this?"

01:01:57.417 --> 01:02:00.429
"Do I want this in my life?"
But he had to eat.

01:02:00.429 --> 01:02:03.248
So he dug down and
found the guts, just like you did.

01:02:03.248 --> 01:02:06.340
- Is that a compliment?
- Yes. Come on. Where you from?

01:02:06.340 --> 01:02:08.868
- La Porte, Indiana.
- Ahh... And what do you do?

01:02:08.878 --> 01:02:11.561
I-I write. I-I try
to get my plays produced.

01:02:11.561 --> 01:02:13.305
I mean, nobody goes
to the theater anymore.

01:02:13.305 --> 01:02:16.111
- And you were going home?
- Yeah. I was.

01:02:18.539 --> 01:02:21.677
So, uh... So tell me something,
all right? For real.

01:02:21.705 --> 01:02:25.673
I probably won't be able to take it,
but, uh... are we gonna get out of here?

01:02:26.981 --> 01:02:31.881
Madelyne, I wouldn't be down here
if I didn't think so. I swear.

01:02:32.186 --> 01:02:35.692
- Promise?
- I promise. Now trust me. Come on.

01:02:46.901 --> 01:02:49.780
So, this explosion that
we're setting, I mean,

01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:52.256
it could cause the whole thing
to cave in, right?

01:02:52.256 --> 01:02:55.413
- It could happen.
- It's better than a blowout.

01:02:56.210 --> 01:03:00.874
A blowout? I really hate
the way that sounds.

01:03:01.882 --> 01:03:03.468
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:03:03.468 --> 01:03:05.798
Go back to the blowout.
Please explain.

01:03:07.087 --> 01:03:08.089
If the water level
was higher,

01:03:08.089 --> 01:03:11.291
the pressure would build and
all the air would blow right to the top.

01:03:11.291 --> 01:03:12.977
Like a... like a cork?
Like a geyser?

01:03:12.977 --> 01:03:15.835
Yeah. It happened to a couple of guys
digging the Baltimore Tunnel last year.

01:03:15.835 --> 01:03:17.675
And what happened to them?
They died, right?

01:03:17.675 --> 01:03:20.387
- Help me open this pack.
- They died, right?

01:03:22.269 --> 01:03:24.783
One made it.
Help me out.

01:03:28.641 --> 01:03:31.933
All right, keep a tight grip.
We're gonna make it.

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:17.980
Kit!

01:05:20.649 --> 01:05:22.648
Kit!

01:06:01.063 --> 01:06:03.828
- You're insane!
- Gimme that, Madelyne.

01:06:09.169 --> 01:06:11.457
We're hot! Go!

01:06:38.228 --> 01:06:40.839
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Go on! It's snagged.

01:06:52.546 --> 01:06:54.824
Stay in there.
Stay in there.

01:06:55.249 --> 01:06:58.105
- What about you?
- The hell with me! Go!

01:06:59.953 --> 01:07:02.938
Go! The hell with me.

01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:49.160
Yes! He did it!

01:07:51.438 --> 01:07:52.394
You okay?

01:07:53.582 --> 01:07:56.548
We gotta stop asking
each other that.

01:08:23.777 --> 01:08:25.457
What do you got?
How big was it?

01:08:25.457 --> 01:08:27.676
Three-point-three.
That's a hell of a bang, sir.

01:08:27.676 --> 01:08:30.685
- Three-bar!
- Look out below! We're coming down!

01:08:40.621 --> 01:08:43.149
Make more room!
We gotta back up the ladder!

01:08:53.834 --> 01:08:57.740
Hey! I heard machines!

01:08:57.970 --> 01:09:00.899
I think they're trying to dig us out
from the Manhattan end!

01:09:01.073 --> 01:09:05.406
- No!
- What? They're digging. What's wrong?

01:09:05.406 --> 01:09:07.729
No. The digging can shift the pressure
and bring the whole place down.

01:09:07.729 --> 01:09:09.350
They're not thinking
about the pressure.

01:09:09.917 --> 01:09:12.843
Or maybe they are
and they think we're dead.

01:09:12.843 --> 01:09:14.430
They're digging
at the Manhattan end!

01:09:14.519 --> 01:09:17.151
Latura! They're coming!

01:09:23.082 --> 01:09:24.249
Oh, shit.

01:09:24.298 --> 01:09:25.386
No!

01:09:34.971 --> 01:09:35.721
George!

01:09:38.425 --> 01:09:42.046
- Hold on, big man! Hold on!
- I can't... I can't... I can't move.

01:09:42.115 --> 01:09:45.004
Can you feel your body?
George, George, can you feel your body?

01:09:45.004 --> 01:09:48.404
- I can't... feel... my body.
- Okay, hold on, big man! Hold on!

01:09:48.404 --> 01:09:51.227
Am I... okay? Am...

01:09:51.616 --> 01:09:55.344
Am... I... o-okay?

01:09:56.450 --> 01:09:57.143
Oh, God.

01:09:59.609 --> 01:10:01.380
Am I okay?

01:10:20.277 --> 01:10:22.195
It'll keep you alive.
Breathe through this, George.

01:10:22.195 --> 01:10:26.007
Breathe, breathe. Please. Come on.
Steady breath! Breathe!

01:10:26.274 --> 01:10:30.141
Don't let it beat you!
Come on, George! Breathe!

01:10:30.141 --> 01:10:34.841
In and out! In!
Come on, George ! Come on.

01:10:34.841 --> 01:10:37.195
Breathe!

01:10:37.271 --> 01:10:39.178
Breathe, breathe, please.

01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:49.274
Leverage! We need leverage!
Get that truck up!

01:10:50.928 --> 01:10:52.011
Come on.

01:10:55.024 --> 01:10:56.502
Oh, George.

01:10:56.940 --> 01:10:58.052
Come on, come on.

01:11:00.102 --> 01:11:01.157
We're coming.

01:11:01.461 --> 01:11:03.953
- All right, got it? Take it.
- I'll take it.

01:11:05.732 --> 01:11:07.959
- We're gonna make it.
- Thank you.

01:11:09.369 --> 01:11:11.620
- Come on. Move, move, move!
- We got him!

01:11:15.917 --> 01:11:17.033
Take that!

01:11:20.089 --> 01:11:22.633
- All right, lift, lift, lift, lift!
- We're with you.

01:11:22.633 --> 01:11:24.664
- We're right here.
- We're with you, George.

01:11:28.121 --> 01:11:32.023
- Breathe as strong as you can.
- That's it, you got it!

01:11:32.092 --> 01:11:34.391
George can't hear
cause the water's going!

01:11:36.863 --> 01:11:40.230
Come on, George.
Stay with us, George. Stay with us.

01:11:40.300 --> 01:11:42.495
Oh, my God.
He's going under.

01:11:44.004 --> 01:11:45.096
Keep them coming!

01:11:47.975 --> 01:11:50.443
- He's going under!
- Get it off him!

01:11:50.510 --> 01:11:51.461
All right!

01:11:54.847 --> 01:11:57.383
- Okay, let me know when.
- Okay!

01:11:57.638 --> 01:12:00.499
One, two, three!

01:12:04.925 --> 01:12:07.083
- We got him!
- He's out.

01:12:07.556 --> 01:12:08.753
Okay, come on.

01:12:11.665 --> 01:12:15.123
Get him out of the water.
Hold his head. Don't let his head go!

01:12:15.202 --> 01:12:19.366
- Get the planks outta there!
- Keep it moving. Come on!

01:12:19.439 --> 01:12:22.045
- Come on! Come on!
- Here it comes.

01:12:22.689 --> 01:12:24.204
We got it.

01:12:24.211 --> 01:12:26.007
Bring it down.
Come on!

01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:30.073
Get over here!

01:12:31.918 --> 01:12:33.918
Everybody get ready to lift him
on the count of three.

01:12:33.918 --> 01:12:35.272
Ready?
All right, all together.

01:12:35.272 --> 01:12:37.001
One, two, three!

01:12:39.619 --> 01:12:43.223
- You got 'im?
- Keep moving so we don't...

01:12:43.764 --> 01:12:47.771
- We need somebody up here!
- Here we go now, all right?

01:12:48.917 --> 01:12:51.129
Come on. Let's go.

01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:54.711
- Let's go. It's freezing.
- You're doing great.

01:12:54.711 --> 01:12:55.796
- Yeah.
- All right?

01:12:56.050 --> 01:12:58.253
Together we can do it, all right?
We can do anything.

01:12:58.253 --> 01:12:59.515
You're doing great.
Ready ?

01:12:59.515 --> 01:13:02.148
All right,
one, two, three. Lift!

01:13:24.208 --> 01:13:29.113
I hope they're alive. Hang on.
We're doing the best we can.

01:13:31.099 --> 01:13:35.212
I don't know. I don't know!
Now, please.

01:13:35.282 --> 01:13:37.782
- Do you have any survivors?
- I can't answer that.

01:13:38.586 --> 01:13:41.060
- Are you going to guard the place?
- Is it completely collapsed?

01:13:41.988 --> 01:13:43.438
Are there any survivors?

01:13:44.558 --> 01:13:46.523
I said that's it!
That's it!

01:13:55.602 --> 01:13:58.186
Why George?
Why not some piece of trash?

01:13:58.215 --> 01:14:00.721
Why... Why is it always
the good people?

01:14:01.274 --> 01:14:05.841
I can't answer that. You just hope...
I mean, you just gotta believe it.

01:14:06.146 --> 01:14:08.502
I think some people
are gonna make it out of there.

01:14:09.216 --> 01:14:11.677
And George
is gonna be one.

01:14:13.213 --> 01:14:15.813
Well... Yeah,
we gotta think that.

01:14:17.390 --> 01:14:19.715
Yeah... we do.

01:14:31.805 --> 01:14:34.222
George, I'd give you my shirt,
but I don't think it'd do much good.

01:14:34.222 --> 01:14:36.647
George, we'd give you
the shirt off our backs.

01:14:37.222 --> 01:14:40.586
It'll be all right, George.
Keep calm. We're here with you.

01:14:40.586 --> 01:14:42.110
How'd you get fired?

01:14:43.075 --> 01:14:45.091
It's a long story.
I wouldn't worry about it.

01:14:45.091 --> 01:14:46.937
Stay awake now.
Stay with us.

01:14:47.754 --> 01:14:51.281
Sheee... said she read
you got people killed.

01:14:55.576 --> 01:14:57.000
She's right.

01:15:03.635 --> 01:15:06.911
Did she mention it was
a building collapse in the South Bronx?

01:15:07.807 --> 01:15:09.063
No, she said...

01:15:09.063 --> 01:15:11.445
And that we were
the first ones on the scene?

01:15:12.546 --> 01:15:13.823
No.

01:15:14.598 --> 01:15:19.097
And then some of the guys said "Forget it.
They're probably dead anyway"?

01:15:20.290 --> 01:15:23.713
Or read the part where I said
"If we were goin' in..."

01:15:26.693 --> 01:15:31.010
Or mention that
I was wrong? Hmm?

01:15:35.302 --> 01:15:38.923
That a gas main blew on the way out
and three men died?

01:15:39.806 --> 01:15:41.680
My friend's brother
was one of them?

01:15:42.275 --> 01:15:45.204
Did she mention the press,
the inquiry, the funerals?

01:15:48.548 --> 01:15:51.257
You're a writer, you can
fill out the rest, can't you?

01:15:54.812 --> 01:15:57.373
So, you never had
a way out of here, did you?

01:16:01.331 --> 01:16:02.389
No.

01:16:08.902 --> 01:16:12.770
- What's that? What's the noise?
- What's going on?

01:16:12.839 --> 01:16:16.015
What does that mean,
Mr. Latura? What does that mean?

01:16:16.676 --> 01:16:18.291
Kit, what's going on?
What's... what's happening here?

01:16:18.651 --> 01:16:21.138
The water wasn't that high
the last time I looked.

01:16:21.195 --> 01:16:23.400
The water must be coming
back in from somewhere!

01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:24.904
I thought you said
you stopped it.

01:16:24.918 --> 01:16:26.820
I slowed it down.
Nothing can stop it.

01:16:26.846 --> 01:16:29.351
So what you're saying
is nothing can save us.

01:16:29.409 --> 01:16:32.093
You asked us to trust you.
We did. For what?

01:16:32.093 --> 01:16:35.520
- To die a slow death in here?
- Is that true, are there no options?

01:16:35.562 --> 01:16:38.424
- There is always a chance.
- How can you lie like that?

01:16:38.765 --> 01:16:40.963
And since we are already in hell,
I guess it's not a problem.

01:16:40.963 --> 01:16:42.059
Look, just let him talk!

01:16:42.059 --> 01:16:44.675
Oh, we've heard enough talking, okay?
We don't need any more speeches.

01:16:44.675 --> 01:16:47.657
That's bullshit! Bullshit!
She's speaking for herself, Kit.

01:16:47.657 --> 01:16:50.061
- We're still alive, Sarah.
- It ain't over!

01:16:50.061 --> 01:16:51.501
Very over!
You wanna kid yourself?

01:16:51.501 --> 01:16:54.386
Go ahead, do it.
False hope and now no hope!

01:16:54.714 --> 01:16:58.680
You've given us both. Thanks
for nothing. Thanks for nothing!

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:01.441
- Sarah. Sarah.
- I can't stand this shit.

01:17:08.459 --> 01:17:10.926
- What's plan "B", Kit?
- There's no plan "B".

01:17:11.097 --> 01:17:11.875
We're with you!

01:17:11.875 --> 01:17:13.859
We can try taking down
another section.

01:17:14.067 --> 01:17:16.379
Look, we could build
another dam if we all pitched in.

01:17:16.379 --> 01:17:17.806
We can beat it.

01:17:17.835 --> 01:17:19.314
Yo, I can go check
the Manhattan end.

01:17:19.314 --> 01:17:21.257
I think I could do it.
Let me try, Kit! Come on!

01:17:21.257 --> 01:17:24.943
Can you get us outta here? Look,
I'm really sorry about what my mom said.

01:17:24.943 --> 01:17:28.731
Just please, just try
and get us out of here! Please!

01:17:55.351 --> 01:17:56.999
- I need your help, George.
- Yeah?

01:17:57.667 --> 01:18:00.151
The bunk rooms off the tunnels,
is there a way in?

01:18:00.918 --> 01:18:02.055
I don't know.

01:18:02.055 --> 01:18:04.420
George, I know you're hurt,
but think.

01:18:04.467 --> 01:18:08.343
Bassett said the sandhogs had bunk rooms
down here for long shifts. Think.

01:18:08.421 --> 01:18:11.962
Maybe there's a... a trapdoor,
a hatch, a ladder, something...

01:18:11.962 --> 01:18:14.971
- Uh, there's a booth.
- Booth? Where?

01:18:14.971 --> 01:18:16.912
Uh, booth three.

01:18:17.327 --> 01:18:19.884
At the New Jersey end.
Booth three.

01:18:20.222 --> 01:18:23.699
Steven, keep everybody together
until I get back. George?

01:18:23.699 --> 01:18:25.433
- Yeah?
- Thanks.

01:18:26.519 --> 01:18:27.545
Yeah.

01:20:39.954 --> 01:20:42.624
Come on.
You stay with us.

01:20:45.561 --> 01:20:47.108
Did you ever have a dog?

01:20:47.665 --> 01:20:51.913
My mom's liked everything in the world
'cept two things: dogs and me.

01:20:52.817 --> 01:20:56.979
Well, she was probably bit once.
I know I was.

01:20:57.056 --> 01:21:00.514
- So, Ashley, where do you live?
- Uh, we're from Maryland.

01:21:00.593 --> 01:21:03.549
- Maryland. Maryland's nice.
- Yeah.

01:21:04.197 --> 01:21:05.440
Well, listen.
If we don't die in here,

01:21:06.015 --> 01:21:08.429
I was wondering if maybe
I could give you a call.

01:21:08.434 --> 01:21:10.800
He thinks
he's being attacked now.

01:21:10.870 --> 01:21:12.126
- Exactly.
- Uh-huh.

01:21:12.872 --> 01:21:17.023
- Why don't you go ahead and pet him.
- We've had him for ten years.

01:21:17.777 --> 01:21:20.075
- That's a long time.
- Yeah, it is.

01:21:20.146 --> 01:21:22.115
Do you have any children?

01:21:24.250 --> 01:21:28.207
Our-our son Jonathan.
He went trekking... in Nepal.

01:21:28.207 --> 01:21:33.651
He, uh... caught some kind of a fever.
Nothing could be done, they said.

01:21:34.325 --> 01:21:35.846
We, uh... We lost him.

01:21:36.336 --> 01:21:38.642
- Oh, I'm so sorry. I-I didn't...
- Oh, no, no.

01:21:41.450 --> 01:21:43.470
Ever since Jonathan died,

01:21:44.250 --> 01:21:46.550
Cooper's all... we've had left.

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:50.275
I guess I spoil him.
You understand...

01:21:50.820 --> 01:21:52.068
Yeah.

01:21:55.229 --> 01:21:57.164
Kit! It's Kit!

01:21:57.584 --> 01:21:59.444
Everybody, Kit!

01:22:05.291 --> 01:22:06.938
I found some dry ground.

01:22:09.436 --> 01:22:11.175
There's always a chance.

01:22:13.533 --> 01:22:15.605
Come on. Let's move.

01:22:16.152 --> 01:22:17.846
Why don't we
just take George now?

01:22:17.846 --> 01:22:19.245
We're gonna check
out booth three,

01:22:19.245 --> 01:22:21.370
then go back and get 'im.
Let's keep moving!

01:22:21.370 --> 01:22:22.561
Okay.

01:22:26.412 --> 01:22:28.826
- George.
- Hi.

01:22:36.289 --> 01:22:38.494
My neck's broken, isn't it?

01:22:42.795 --> 01:22:45.267
You... You find the room?

01:22:45.533 --> 01:22:49.492
Yeah, it's, um... it's through
this underwater passage.

01:22:49.569 --> 01:22:54.638
It's very difficult. I... I think that
with a little bit of luck we could...

01:22:57.533 --> 01:22:59.370
Christ, I don't know
what to think.

01:23:00.290 --> 01:23:03.227
I do. You just
have to leave me.

01:23:03.416 --> 01:23:04.959
- No, no.
- Yeah.

01:23:04.959 --> 01:23:05.897
That's dumb. That's stupid.

01:23:06.686 --> 01:23:07.680
We can make it.

01:23:07.680 --> 01:23:09.413
- Not with a broken neck.
- Yes, George.

01:23:09.808 --> 01:23:13.841
I just need some time to figure it out.
Really, I just need some time.

01:23:13.993 --> 01:23:17.205
Hey, take the bracelet
for me.

01:23:18.364 --> 01:23:21.438
Please. It's in my pocket.
My-my right pocket.

01:23:21.438 --> 01:23:23.758
- George, don't quit on me.
- Take it.

01:23:23.758 --> 01:23:25.989
- Don't quit on me.
- Take it, please.

01:23:25.989 --> 01:23:27.520
- No.
- Take it!

01:23:29.142 --> 01:23:30.426
Please.

01:23:31.844 --> 01:23:35.488
Please, give me that...
give me that much respect.

01:23:38.924 --> 01:23:42.456
Jesus, there's just
so much I wish I'd done.

01:23:43.990 --> 01:23:46.673
I never had me...
a nice car.

01:23:47.193 --> 01:23:49.019
Never had any kids.

01:23:49.796 --> 01:23:52.013
I finally meet
a woman I love,

01:23:52.548 --> 01:23:55.949
I didn't even get the chance
to tell her that I love her.

01:23:56.903 --> 01:23:59.331
- You think she... she-she knows?
- Yeah.

01:24:00.807 --> 01:24:03.016
- You think so?
- She knows. I'm sure she does.

01:24:04.944 --> 01:24:05.915
That's good.

01:24:08.789 --> 01:24:10.548
Get them to daylight.

01:24:11.951 --> 01:24:16.850
Don't let them die
in this place. Hear?

01:24:16.944 --> 01:24:18.669
Tell them I'm gone.

01:24:19.659 --> 01:24:21.316
You've done
all you could do.

01:24:22.261 --> 01:24:25.803
You know it...
and I know it.

01:24:32.371 --> 01:24:34.041
I'm very sorry.

01:24:49.922 --> 01:24:53.489
I... I love you... Grace.

01:24:56.896 --> 01:24:58.946
I'm sorry.

01:25:24.758 --> 01:25:25.858
What's that mean?

01:25:25.858 --> 01:25:28.401
I don't know, Ellie.
The structure's shifting.

01:25:34.022 --> 01:25:35.617
What about George?

01:25:37.197 --> 01:25:38.937
George didn't make it.

01:25:39.005 --> 01:25:39.784
Huh?

01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:49.320
Don't.

01:25:52.852 --> 01:25:54.060
I know
everybody's freezing,

01:25:54.573 --> 01:25:57.882
but we have to make
a short swim... underwater.

01:25:57.882 --> 01:26:01.848
Underwater? Well, I'm not so sure
that I can... I can do this.

01:26:01.848 --> 01:26:04.314
Look, if I can do it,
you can do it.

01:26:04.314 --> 01:26:09.861
Everybody take three deep breaths...
and go. We can do this.

01:26:11.370 --> 01:26:14.050
- Come on, baby. Come on.
- I can't!

01:26:14.050 --> 01:26:15.732
I can't do this! I can't.

01:26:17.205 --> 01:26:20.385
One, two, three.

01:26:29.722 --> 01:26:31.491
And go. Come on.

01:26:34.044 --> 01:26:35.870
Come on. Keep going.
Get up there.

01:26:43.469 --> 01:26:44.552
... three!

01:26:51.626 --> 01:26:53.333
I'm right behind you,
Eleanor.

01:26:55.708 --> 01:26:57.718
Yes! Go!

01:27:09.528 --> 01:27:11.486
Here we go, boy.
Go, boy.

01:27:25.912 --> 01:27:29.132
Quick, get her out of the water.
Help her out. Help her out. Help her out.

01:27:33.085 --> 01:27:34.576
Go ahead.

01:27:43.863 --> 01:27:45.311
All right,
everybody stay together.

01:27:48.768 --> 01:27:52.853
All right. Averybody stay together.
Use each other's body heat, okay?

01:27:52.853 --> 01:27:56.413
Fight the cold. Stay warm.
Stay in groups.

01:27:56.502 --> 01:27:59.915
Don't stay alone.
Okay? Stay in groups.

01:27:59.915 --> 01:28:01.556
- What do we do now, Kit?
- We don't do nothin'.

01:28:01.728 --> 01:28:04.516
We just sit here and wait
and pray they get here.

01:28:04.872 --> 01:28:08.373
Wait? Wait? That's it?

01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.940
There's...
There's nothing we can do?

01:28:12.124 --> 01:28:14.558
You did what you could.

01:28:14.627 --> 01:28:17.619
You did great. You did great.

01:28:19.119 --> 01:28:20.427
You gotta fight it.

01:28:20.499 --> 01:28:21.703
- Fight the cold.
- I'm trying.

01:28:21.703 --> 01:28:23.826
Just fight it.
Just fight it. Just fight it.

01:28:27.940 --> 01:28:29.383
Where's Cooper?

01:28:31.510 --> 01:28:34.857
Where's Cooper?
Where's Cooper?!

01:28:35.414 --> 01:28:38.461
It broke.
I couldn't hold him.

01:28:38.918 --> 01:28:41.853
- Oh, my God!
- My God, I tried. I tried.

01:28:41.921 --> 01:28:45.448
- Oh, my God! I can't lose him!
- Ellie. Ellie! No.

01:28:45.524 --> 01:28:48.952
- No.
- It was Jonathan's dog.

01:28:48.952 --> 01:28:52.108
Look, look, Eleanor.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

01:28:52.531 --> 01:28:55.125
We can't bring them back.
They're both gone.

01:28:55.201 --> 01:28:57.056
We can't change that.

01:29:00.373 --> 01:29:03.737
We've gotta...
help each other let them go.

01:29:14.292 --> 01:29:16.777
Don't, let's... fight.

01:29:23.638 --> 01:29:25.126
Hold me.

01:29:29.283 --> 01:29:31.061
Hold me.

01:29:48.721 --> 01:29:51.189
Jesus! They're gonna
save us to death.

01:29:52.825 --> 01:29:54.050
Oh, my God!

01:29:58.429 --> 01:30:00.874
- Oh, no, no, no, no.
- Get back. Get back.

01:30:00.900 --> 01:30:03.076
Don't let those things touch you!
Move away! Move away!

01:30:05.107 --> 01:30:06.416
Latonya!

01:30:07.907 --> 01:30:11.275
- Come on, Sarah.
- I'm not leaving.

01:30:11.964 --> 01:30:13.668
Move, move, move, move!

01:30:16.793 --> 01:30:19.557
- Come on. Sarah.
- Listen!

01:30:20.453 --> 01:30:24.739
I don't wanna die like this!
I don't wanna die like this!

01:30:24.924 --> 01:30:28.538
Oh, God!
I don't wanna die like this!

01:30:28.538 --> 01:30:32.016
It's okay, Latonya.
I'm coming.

01:30:32.298 --> 01:30:34.596
I'm coming, Latonya.
Hold on.

01:30:34.667 --> 01:30:37.397
I don't wanna die like this!

01:30:38.190 --> 01:30:40.064
- I hate 'em!
- All right, here I come.

01:30:40.139 --> 01:30:41.927
I don't wanna go like this!

01:30:41.927 --> 01:30:44.702
Hang on. I'm coming. I'm coming.
I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here.

01:30:44.702 --> 01:30:48.836
They can't hurt you, okay?
They're just... shit with feet.

01:30:48.836 --> 01:30:51.691
Okay? Shit with feet.
Can you say that?

01:30:53.658 --> 01:30:54.369
Don't look down.

01:30:54.487 --> 01:30:56.177
- Watch out!
- All right! All right! Come on.

01:30:59.406 --> 01:31:00.668
Keep 'em away
from your feet!

01:31:01.460 --> 01:31:03.928
Shit with feet, baby.

01:31:05.331 --> 01:31:07.466
They know a way out.

01:31:15.864 --> 01:31:18.424
Steven, help me get this thing
off the wall! Get it off!

01:31:26.251 --> 01:31:28.354
There's a room!
There's another room!

01:31:37.263 --> 01:31:41.290
No, no! Not now!
Gimme some tools! Anything!

01:31:41.367 --> 01:31:43.464
Find anything you can!
Come on!

01:31:47.274 --> 01:31:48.869
Let's try
to pop these rivets.

01:31:48.941 --> 01:31:50.733
- Roger!
- Sarah, over there!

01:31:51.544 --> 01:31:54.646
Roge... Roger!

01:32:02.821 --> 01:32:05.414
I thought
she was resting.

01:32:06.859 --> 01:32:08.679
I'm sorry.

01:32:13.334 --> 01:32:14.903
Roger, we gotta
get out of here.

01:32:16.468 --> 01:32:18.315
There's no way she wanted
you to die down here too.

01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:20.044
Roger, she wants you to live.

01:32:20.044 --> 01:32:21.550
I'm not gonna leave her!

01:32:22.808 --> 01:32:26.575
Okay. Okay.

01:32:29.926 --> 01:32:31.979
If you're staying,
I'm staying.

01:32:32.618 --> 01:32:35.143
I'm not leaving anybody
behind again.

01:32:40.826 --> 01:32:43.522
- Roger, come on!
- Let's go. Come on.

01:32:43.596 --> 01:32:45.757
We're moving out.
Out! Get out!

01:32:45.757 --> 01:32:48.597
Come on. Get up!
We're not leaving you. We gotta go.

01:32:48.632 --> 01:32:51.321
- Come on. Get up. We gotta go.
- The water's gettin' higher!

01:32:54.073 --> 01:32:56.405
Come on, come on!

01:33:13.834 --> 01:33:14.922
I see 'em!

01:33:14.957 --> 01:33:18.365
Right-right there, the rats!
A-a-at the top of the stairs.

01:33:18.495 --> 01:33:20.053
Kit, they're going...
they're going up the stairs.

01:33:20.053 --> 01:33:21.713
There's somethin'
at the top of the stairs!

01:33:34.913 --> 01:33:36.380
Oh, no!

01:33:45.591 --> 01:33:49.294
Get up. Come on.
Come on, Madelyne, up.

01:33:49.853 --> 01:33:50.589
Get up!

01:33:55.249 --> 01:33:58.228
All right, go, go, go!
Move it! Up the stairs!

01:33:58.304 --> 01:34:00.329
Up the stairs! Go!

01:34:05.678 --> 01:34:06.716
Keep going!

01:34:13.519 --> 01:34:15.787
Kit! I got you!

01:34:16.255 --> 01:34:17.627
Hold on!

01:34:20.735 --> 01:34:22.195
All right. Go! Go!

01:34:23.929 --> 01:34:26.029
- Come on. Let's move!
- Let's go!

01:34:30.008 --> 01:34:33.270
Kit, I've got a way out! I found
a way out! Come on, everybody!

01:34:34.592 --> 01:34:36.956
It looks like some kind
of unfinished sewer system or something.

01:34:40.846 --> 01:34:44.304
- Oh, my God! It's the lady's dog!
- Cooper!

01:34:44.383 --> 01:34:46.112
- No, no, no. Forget it.
- Cooper!

01:34:46.185 --> 01:34:48.637
- It's just a stupid dog.
- Shut up, Vincent!

01:34:48.637 --> 01:34:50.539
What's the matter with you?
It's just a dog!

01:34:52.024 --> 01:34:52.365
Let me get him!

01:34:52.365 --> 01:34:53.734
There's a way out up here!
Will you forget it?

01:34:55.333 --> 01:34:57.279
Leave the dog.
Leave the stupid dog.

01:34:57.279 --> 01:34:59.337
Shut the hell up,
Vincent!

01:35:03.029 --> 01:35:04.063
Oh, no.

01:35:06.004 --> 01:35:07.523
I don't believe it!

01:35:08.923 --> 01:35:11.099
Come on.

01:35:11.176 --> 01:35:13.056
Come on, Cooper!

01:35:19.220 --> 01:35:20.154
Oh, shit!

01:35:26.519 --> 01:35:28.855
Kit! Kit! Kit!

01:35:29.661 --> 01:35:32.066
- Keep going! Keep going!
- Not without you!

01:35:32.066 --> 01:35:35.139
- Forget about me! There's no time!
- No, no, we'll make time!

01:35:35.139 --> 01:35:36.633
- Somebody, Steven, do something.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:35:38.403 --> 01:35:40.467
- Pull it! Pull it!
- Damn!

01:35:40.539 --> 01:35:44.332
Roger, there's nothing to throw.
We can't find anything!

01:35:45.471 --> 01:35:48.071
- All right. Hold on! Hold on!
- This place is comin' apart!

01:35:48.106 --> 01:35:50.859
- You wouldn't leave us!
- I would leave you!

01:35:51.150 --> 01:35:53.680
I left George!
I left him to die! Get out!

01:35:53.969 --> 01:35:56.944
- Take this. Here.
- Come on, come on.

01:35:57.396 --> 01:36:02.061
- No, no, no! Don't do it!
- Come on. Reach for it.

01:36:02.061 --> 01:36:04.800
Madelyne, no. No.

01:36:10.536 --> 01:36:11.864
It's collapsing!

01:36:12.691 --> 01:36:14.047
Oh, my God!

01:36:14.440 --> 01:36:17.540
Why didn't you leave?
What the hell did you do?

01:36:17.540 --> 01:36:18.647
Damn!

01:36:20.717 --> 01:36:21.512
You get a hold of something!

01:36:21.580 --> 01:36:24.140
Go, go, Steven!
You gotta keep going!

01:36:24.216 --> 01:36:27.344
What the hell are you talking about?
You can't leave us!

01:36:27.419 --> 01:36:28.141
They gotta leave!

01:36:28.141 --> 01:36:31.379
Mikey, Mikey,
there's gotta be another way!

01:36:31.379 --> 01:36:34.037
- We can't find anything.
- Sweetheart, look for some...

01:36:34.159 --> 01:36:35.704
There must be
something else!

01:36:44.746 --> 01:36:45.722
Can you make it?

01:36:53.018 --> 01:36:54.102
There's no way out!

01:36:54.179 --> 01:36:58.172
You can't reach us!
That's home up there!

01:36:58.498 --> 01:36:59.728
No!

01:37:02.002 --> 01:37:02.935
No!

01:37:07.308 --> 01:37:08.287
What do we do?

01:37:09.752 --> 01:37:12.198
Ashley, flashlight!
Here!

01:37:13.031 --> 01:37:14.872
- No.
- Ah, man, no.

01:37:15.067 --> 01:37:16.516
Kit!

01:37:16.835 --> 01:37:21.602
No, Steven!
Don't leave me!

01:37:21.849 --> 01:37:25.349
Go! You heard me!
Go! Everybody, out! Everybody out!

01:37:25.947 --> 01:37:26.960
We gotta go!

01:37:27.012 --> 01:37:30.608
I didn't leave you, Mikey!
I'll die!

01:37:34.612 --> 01:37:36.182
Go, go!
Watch your head!

01:37:40.382 --> 01:37:42.460
Oh, God!

01:37:42.528 --> 01:37:44.996
Go! Come on.
Keep going!

01:37:45.063 --> 01:37:48.191
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:37:54.840 --> 01:37:56.634
Nooo.

01:38:02.951 --> 01:38:05.508
We're not gonna
get out of here, are we?

01:38:05.517 --> 01:38:06.930
Come on.

01:38:10.785 --> 01:38:13.273
- Kit, I can't.
- Come on.

01:38:23.796 --> 01:38:25.040
What's that?

01:38:25.203 --> 01:38:28.172
Fuses. We gotta go back
to where we started.

01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:30.936
No. No, Kit, it's...
it's too far.

01:38:31.009 --> 01:38:35.208
No, no. Anything I can do,
you can do. Here, hold this.

01:39:06.945 --> 01:39:09.140
We... We gotta try it!

01:39:09.836 --> 01:39:10.927
What?

01:39:12.682 --> 01:39:13.574
A blowout.

01:39:13.652 --> 01:39:16.746
- A blow... A blowout?
- We gotta do it! Come on!

01:39:16.822 --> 01:39:19.041
We're gonna try a blowout.
Come on.

01:39:19.224 --> 01:39:21.694
Where... are we... going?

01:39:21.694 --> 01:39:24.479
Gotta get up to the ceiling
and blast out the mud.

01:39:24.479 --> 01:39:27.573
If it works, the pressure
will take us right to the top.

01:39:32.671 --> 01:39:35.152
Why don't you leave your car here
and I'll drive you home.

01:39:51.619 --> 01:39:52.734
My God.

01:40:22.988 --> 01:40:25.324
I got you, girl.
I got you.

01:40:27.361 --> 01:40:29.494
Easy. Easy.
Take it easy.

01:40:31.196 --> 01:40:33.289
Easy. Easy.
Okay, come on.

01:40:38.128 --> 01:40:39.430
Take it easy now.

01:40:45.677 --> 01:40:48.603
- You're all right.
- Easy, easy.

01:40:51.914 --> 01:40:54.581
Roger, we did it!
Come on. We made it.

01:41:15.107 --> 01:41:18.133
Come on. It's okay.
Good dog.

01:41:21.413 --> 01:41:23.210
Easy. All right.

01:41:23.281 --> 01:41:25.875
Come on. We got you.
We got you.

01:41:26.076 --> 01:41:28.777
It's okay.
All right, all right.

01:41:32.491 --> 01:41:35.174
That's everybody.
Everybody's out.

01:41:37.295 --> 01:41:39.351
Are you sure
there's nobody else down there?

01:41:39.805 --> 01:41:43.172
Hole's fillin' up with water.
Everybody's out.

01:41:52.429 --> 01:41:54.429
- Nobody else?
- Leave me alone.

01:41:57.883 --> 01:42:00.670
I'm okay. I'm all right.

01:42:02.587 --> 01:42:04.483
- I'm okay.
- No, daddy, it's okay.

01:42:05.757 --> 01:42:07.735
It's okay. We're okay.

01:42:24.576 --> 01:42:27.136
Come on. Come on.

01:42:27.212 --> 01:42:28.960
All right, go ahead.

01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:34.906
I'm gonna sit.
I'm gonna sit over... here.

01:42:36.388 --> 01:42:41.682
- I don't even care. I feel so tired.
- You gotta fight it.

01:42:42.108 --> 01:42:44.253
Never thought
I'd end up like this, you know?

01:42:44.736 --> 01:42:48.042
You weren't supposed to.
You weren't supposed to.

01:42:50.404 --> 01:42:54.730
I always...
thought I'd die old.

01:43:02.047 --> 01:43:06.116
Keep trying, you piece o' shit!
Keep trying!

01:43:06.966 --> 01:43:09.412
How many chances
do you need?

01:43:10.237 --> 01:43:13.916
You killed everybody else,
but you know what?

01:43:14.892 --> 01:43:16.733
You should've killed me!

01:43:17.829 --> 01:43:19.869
Cause I found your heart!

01:43:20.232 --> 01:43:24.931
I found your heart,
and I'll blow it out of your body!

01:43:42.590 --> 01:43:43.911
We gotta go.

01:43:45.090 --> 01:43:46.434
Give me your arm,
Madelyne.

01:43:54.299 --> 01:43:58.518
You never...
would have left us... would you?

01:44:03.208 --> 01:44:07.123
No. No.

01:46:05.309 --> 01:46:06.413
Kit.

01:46:49.774 --> 01:46:53.801
- All right, easy. Easy. Easy.
- Slide it over.

01:46:53.878 --> 01:46:56.557
Clear a path.
Come on. Easy.

01:46:56.614 --> 01:46:59.901
- We have a wheelchair for you, ma'am.
- It's all right. I'm gonna walk.

01:47:14.065 --> 01:47:17.091
Hey. All right.

01:47:17.168 --> 01:47:18.714
You're doin' fine.

01:47:25.410 --> 01:47:27.754
Stop. Stop, stop. Stop.

01:47:31.434 --> 01:47:32.868
Grace.

01:47:44.089 --> 01:47:45.745
All right, come on.
Let's get him out of here.

01:47:45.934 --> 01:47:47.121
Come on, come on.
Let's go.

01:48:02.080 --> 01:48:05.332
Since we're both going to the hospital,
I wanna ride with you.

01:48:05.783 --> 01:48:07.502
Don't you have
something better to do?

01:48:07.741 --> 01:48:12.457
Well, considering I'm homeless
and broke and carless

01:48:12.457 --> 01:48:17.390
and... I'm not lookin' my best,
I think I'll ride with you.

01:48:18.530 --> 01:48:20.636
- One condition.
- What's that?

01:48:22.901 --> 01:48:25.495
We gotta take the bridge.
