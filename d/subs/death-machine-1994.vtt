Oh, it's all yours.
This is out of my league.

02:10.975 --> 02:13.739
Relax, Chief.
We'll take it from here.

03:38.618 --> 03:40.341
<i>No! Aahh!</i>

04:04.193 --> 04:05.574
There he is...

04:07.239 --> 04:09.084
The ultimate soldier.

04:13.754 --> 04:17.933
No mercy, no pity.
No fear.

04:21.476 --> 04:22.815
Oh yeah.

04:24.810 --> 04:26.010
Save it.

04:31.051 --> 04:33.596
They'll glitch, then overload
and shut down.

04:34.027 --> 04:37.289
Help me!

04:42.112 --> 04:44.069
Happens every time.

05:27.286 --> 05:28.983
Everything's under
control, Dixon.

05:29.108 --> 05:32.229
Out of sight, and completely
out of mind, do you get my meaning?

05:33.106 --> 05:36.287
I understand completely, sir.
Needs of national security.

05:36.410 --> 05:38.739
That's good, Dixon.
That's very good.

05:39.143 --> 05:41.105
You've done a great job.
Just make sure

05:41.221 --> 05:43.469
that nobody saw nothin'.

05:43.608 --> 05:45.892
National security.
Thank you, ma'am.

05:46.723 --> 05:50.585
<i>He was pounding the wall
like a road jig or something,</i>

05:50.709 --> 05:54.066
<i>just... over and over again,
like a-an automatic, and just--</i>

05:54.185 --> 05:56.285
<i>Are you trying to tell us
that this was a man?</i>

05:56.333 --> 05:59.279
- <i>A human being?</i>
- <i>Oh, definitely.</i>

05:59.404 --> 06:01.055
<i>A man machine!</i>

06:01.156 --> 06:03.547
<i>The new reports add weight
to the accusations</i>

06:03.579 --> 06:05.879
<i>leveled at the Chaank
Armaments Corporation,</i>

06:05.999 --> 06:09.122
<i>by a growing alliance
of humanist organizations,</i>

06:09.218 --> 06:11.756

Chaank is, quote:</i>

<i>The original allegations arose

<i>of Joint Chief Executive
Bob Nicholson,</i>

06:21.955 --> 06:23.390
<i>currently unexplained.</i>

06:23.449 --> 06:25.989
<i>And tonight are still

06:26.112 --> 06:28.333
<i>outside Chaank's
downtown facility.</i>

06:28.702 --> 06:31.909
<i>Chaank kills children!
Chaank kills children!</i>

06:32.041 --> 06:35.011
<i>Chaank kills children!
Chaank kills children!</i>

07:03.929 --> 07:05.382
Wait!

07:07.152 --> 07:08.152
Wait!

07:08.692 --> 07:10.580
Miss Cale, can we
have a statement?

07:14.125 --> 07:17.710
I understand the deep,
emotional reactions

07:17.855 --> 07:20.172
to allegations
of illegal projects.

07:21.156 --> 07:23.750
But I assure you,
a full public disclosure

07:23.794 --> 07:26.061
will be made
by this corporation.

07:27.143 --> 07:29.472
And all your questions
will be answered.

07:29.511 --> 07:32.560
<i>Earlier today, a Chaank
spokesman said he believed</i>

07:32.683 --> 07:36.553
<i>that new Joint Chief Executive
Hayden Cale's impressive reputation</i>

07:36.641 --> 07:38.438
<i>would bring an end
to the public disquiet.</i>

07:38.474 --> 07:41.378
Miss Cale, are you aware
that under the '94 FOI revision

07:41.503 --> 07:43.735
all new exoctic projects must
be disclosed to congress?

07:43.774 --> 07:45.381
Of course
she is aware!

07:45.437 --> 07:48.816
Chaank isa responsible corporation
with a clear world vision.

07:49.445 --> 07:51.819
As a Chief Executive yourself,
Mr. Ridley.

07:51.903 --> 07:55.020
does that vision include
systematic law breaking?

07:55.094 --> 07:58.874
<i>We know our maxim:
Hard technology for a hard world.</i>

07:58.936 --> 08:02.559
<i>If it wasn't for people like us,
you'd all be speaking Russian.</i>

08:23.070 --> 08:25.103
So how did
this report get out?

08:27.387 --> 08:29.894
There's a leak somewhere,
we tried to stomp on it, but...

08:30.009 --> 08:31.209
Fuck the leak!

08:32.885 --> 08:36.345
Now our alleged involvement
made prme time last night.

08:36.984 --> 08:38.850
You gotta
can the stations.

08:39.738 --> 08:42.061
Easier said than done
with the new syndicators.

08:42.094 --> 08:44.811
Then find the leak,
and plug him.

08:44.935 --> 08:46.135
Her.

08:47.628 --> 08:48.928
I'm the leak.

08:51.037 --> 08:53.177
Well, that's stunningly
noble, Cale.

08:53.729 --> 08:55.634
But we're not
selling hamburgers.

08:55.758 --> 08:57.521
Your behavior
on camera and off

08:57.683 --> 09:00.749
is not proven conducive
to better public relations.

09:01.346 --> 09:03.284
That's a mutual
observation, Scott.

09:03.407 --> 09:04.631
And irrelevant.

09:04.856 --> 09:07.103
GSE has imposed me to
clean under your carpets,

09:07.126 --> 09:10.189
and rest assured,
I suck like an Electrolux.

09:12.338 --> 09:14.483
Incidentally,
I speak Russian.

09:14.883 --> 09:17.836
- I'm gonna sit down now.
- You're a Chief Executive.

09:18.259 --> 09:20.086
Start acting like it.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.373
All right.

09:22.809 --> 09:23.906
One:

09:24.233 --> 09:28.328
This corporation's belligerent stance
in it's attempts to surpress the media

09:28.449 --> 09:31.916
are breeding rumor and protest.
So I'm sure you'll all agree

09:32.031 --> 09:34.988
that a public disclosure would be
preferable to an other outburts

09:35.111 --> 09:37.853
on the networks
or syndicators.

09:39.218 --> 09:42.477
- Two...
- This is a moot discussion anyway.

09:42.577 --> 09:46.474
The Hardman project
just doesn't work.

09:47.432 --> 09:49.418
We're recommending
a complete shutdown.

09:49.558 --> 09:52.276
- What are you talking about?
- It's fundamentally flawed.

09:52.399 --> 09:54.820
- John.
- Direct cerebral downloading

09:54.936 --> 09:57.176
- generates collateral errors.
- John.

09:57.292 --> 09:59.362
I've explained this
to Dante over and over.

09:59.494 --> 10:01.393
- John.
- You know how excitable he gets.

10:01.508 --> 10:02.690
- John!
- What! What!

10:02.805 --> 10:04.137
Shut the fuck up.

10:05.024 --> 10:06.527
Did I just hear right?

10:07.565 --> 10:09.736
Am I to understand
that those demonstrators outside

10:09.776 --> 10:11.913
- might actually have a point?
- You should understand--

10:11.937 --> 10:13.605
I want every suspect project
shut down!

10:13.690 --> 10:15.745
I want all the details
on my desk tonight,

10:15.833 --> 10:17.519
and I want Dante fired
right now.

10:17.584 --> 10:19.783
With respect, Miss Cale,
he's an invaluable asset.

10:19.884 --> 10:22.896
He never submits reports,
he illegally orders supplies,

10:23.020 --> 10:26.340
he's working secretly in Vault Ten,
and he's not here now!

10:28.983 --> 10:30.716
I vote we kick him out.

10:49.459 --> 10:52.249
You should understand
that you're one of us now.

10:57.924 --> 10:59.391
Are you still itching?

10:59.820 --> 11:02.514
Those monitors take
a while to get used to.

11:03.369 --> 11:05.185
Listen, thread carefully
around Dante.

11:05.245 --> 11:07.224
- Are you threatening me?
- No.

11:08.212 --> 11:10.286
Read Nicholson's file.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.834
<i>Hi, Hayden. I just
spoke with Jack Dante.</i>

12:27.030 --> 12:28.655
<i>He says
he'll see you now.</i>

12:28.943 --> 12:31.683
He'll see me?
Great.

12:44.093 --> 12:46.499
Excuse me, which way
to Engineering?

15:18.780 --> 15:19.799
Uh...

15:21.396 --> 15:25.226
What are you doing in here?
This is my room.

15:25.726 --> 15:27.160
Well, keep it clean.

15:29.804 --> 15:31.238
Get out of my room.

15:31.470 --> 15:35.032
When I say I wanna see you,
I expect you to come to my office.

15:37.051 --> 15:40.091
- Who are you?
- Hayden Cale.

15:40.701 --> 15:42.470
I run this corporation.

15:45.705 --> 15:46.905
Oh.

15:47.999 --> 15:52.090
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
The boss lady.

15:52.158 --> 15:53.358
Yeah.

15:55.980 --> 15:57.909
Don't I know you?

16:18.905 --> 16:21.407
I want to see
what you're doing in Vault Ten.

16:23.867 --> 16:27.431
Entry is rated
Dual Code Access.

16:27.547 --> 16:32.916
You've got to get Ridley to swipe
his card the same time as yours.

16:35.689 --> 16:38.413
- So how do you do it?
- I'm smart.

16:42.506 --> 16:43.506
Show me.

16:49.108 --> 16:53.008
What does the number
7796452 mean to you?

16:53.042 --> 16:54.728
I don't know
what you're talking about.

16:55.677 --> 16:57.993
Dont recognize your own
com link number?

16:58.050 --> 16:59.784
How about account ident?

16:59.923 --> 17:06.962
213-95234-C containing
7,852,320 dollars and 27 cents...

17:07.086 --> 17:08.310
...I believe.

17:09.461 --> 17:11.521
How did you
get that information?

17:12.098 --> 17:14.762
Same way I got your address,
1011 Century Plaza,

17:14.792 --> 17:18.021
same way I could get your
door code if I wanted to:

17:18.163 --> 17:19.363
Hacking!

17:19.829 --> 17:22.976
I've got all the best gear
right here.

17:23.152 --> 17:26.890
I can find out
anything I want.

17:29.496 --> 17:31.352
Stay out of my files.

17:34.771 --> 17:40.037
Oh, well, I think I'm going
to find out all about you...

17:40.152 --> 17:41.644
...Miss Cale.

18:04.455 --> 18:06.925
<i>I understand the deep
emotional response--</i>

18:09.059 --> 18:10.459
<i>I-I-I understand--</i>

18:13.995 --> 18:17.520
<i>...the deep emotional re--
...deep emotional respo-response--</i>

18:19.299 --> 18:20.668
<i>...to allegations of--</i>

18:22.836 --> 18:24.369
<i>...illegal projects.</i>

18:57.214 --> 18:58.425
Where you been?

19:01.541 --> 19:03.141
Been gettin' provisions.

19:09.306 --> 19:10.790
See, B?
Goods.

19:14.186 --> 19:15.386
All right.

19:17.629 --> 19:18.829
And...

19:20.805 --> 19:22.105
Wang!

19:38.193 --> 19:39.493
Almost forgot.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.573
I got this
from Morse today.

19:44.471 --> 19:48.620
Scott Ridley.
Also know as the Rat.

19:48.931 --> 19:50.225
I want you...

19:53.213 --> 19:55.218
...to implant that
on your brain.

19:59.040 --> 20:02.626
And of course, the lovely Cale,
Nicholson's replacement.

20:03.149 --> 20:05.708
They are the target.

20:06.238 --> 20:08.761
Whe should have hid
right after Nicholson croaked.

20:09.671 --> 20:10.876
But we didn't.

20:11.370 --> 20:13.037
You gotta learn patience.

20:15.010 --> 20:16.943
Now remember
these faces.

20:17.283 --> 20:20.195
The core containment
can not be opened

20:20.318 --> 20:22.651
without their D-Lock
sequences.

20:22.774 --> 20:24.768
We just ought to
play the Cutter.

20:24.914 --> 20:27.368
- It's 90 minutes max.
- It'll never work.

20:27.684 --> 20:30.393
- Two hours minimum.
- In any case we only use the Cutter

20:30.517 --> 20:32.541
if they refuse to spill.

20:34.187 --> 20:36.698
- They won't.
- They will.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.616
And so...

20:41.153 --> 20:44.331
...the weird turned pro.

21:00.944 --> 21:02.769
- We can't just ignore him!
- Watch me.

21:02.899 --> 21:04.897
Fine! Then just give me your card,
and I'll deal with Dante.

21:04.952 --> 21:06.302
You can go home
and shed your skin!

21:06.434 --> 21:07.563
Fuck you!

21:07.686 --> 21:10.399
Why don't you go back to your
ten million dollar apartment

21:10.530 --> 21:12.729
and play with
your fucking cat, huh?

21:14.201 --> 21:17.701
You're as morally reprehensible
as the rest of us.

21:18.487 --> 21:20.814
He could be building
anything down there.

21:20.939 --> 21:24.076
Nicholson did what you're doing.
You read the autopsy.

21:24.176 --> 21:26.828
- Shark attack.
- In this fucking building?

21:26.981 --> 21:29.119
He was chewed to death.
His body was covered

21:29.244 --> 21:32.383
in synthetic lubricants, and
all Dante ever said is he's building

21:32.523 --> 21:36.378
the "meanest motherfucking
frontline morale destroyer ever".

21:37.113 --> 21:38.701
In his words.

21:39.660 --> 21:41.593
And you wanna
keep him busy?

21:41.669 --> 21:43.535
I just wanna
stay alive.

21:45.407 --> 21:47.500
I thought this was
a responsible corporation.

21:47.648 --> 21:49.148
Christ. Hardly.

22:00.660 --> 22:08.390
<i>Accessing personnel file

Try "HARDCORE".

23:41.796 --> 23:44.638
- Bad guess.
- I want you out!

23:44.724 --> 23:47.862
- I just got here.
- You know what I mean.

23:48.696 --> 23:53.073
But I'm having so much fun!
You know, it's cool here.

23:53.633 --> 23:56.390
There's loads

23:57.267 --> 24:00.162
Except, you know,
nobody talks to me, and,

24:00.262 --> 24:03.383
I'm cleverer than anyone,
and nobody comes even near me.

24:05.840 --> 24:08.582
Except you.

24:15.555 --> 24:20.222
And I know
what you're after.

24:24.224 --> 24:29.048
With weapons like mine,
and authorization like yours,

24:29.102 --> 24:32.873
we could do
some serious damage.

24:36.014 --> 24:38.277
Sounds like a
wet dream to me.

24:45.987 --> 24:48.809
I got something
I wanna show you.

24:55.313 --> 24:56.733
That's not it.

24:56.910 --> 24:58.681
Hold on to this
for a second, would you?

25:05.379 --> 25:07.867
Ta-daaa!

25:08.107 --> 25:11.404
I just knew I'd seen you
someplace before.

25:13.893 --> 25:15.013
I was...

25:15.933 --> 25:19.133
- I was just a kid.
- Oh, come on, admit it!

25:19.734 --> 25:22.589
You are hot.

25:23.965 --> 25:27.796
- Jelly, baby.
- Get out.

25:31.677 --> 25:33.439
God, that turns me on.

25:36.419 --> 25:39.753
Would you like to do it,
like really kind of...

25:41.101 --> 25:42.733
...weird?

25:53.729 --> 25:54.784
Right.

25:55.197 --> 25:56.469
Time of the month.

26:03.590 --> 26:07.121
You know, all that stuff
is a total mystery to me.

26:18.558 --> 26:20.055
Get some rest.

28:51.528 --> 28:55.704
It's incredibly stupid, the perimiter
access says Adam and I still work here.

28:57.819 --> 29:00.191
So much for
automated security.

29:00.315 --> 29:01.805
Time for a big burge.

29:05.516 --> 29:06.980
And down.

29:09.823 --> 29:11.080
And mark.

29:21.422 --> 29:22.805
Okay.

29:23.673 --> 29:25.292
Recap time, yeah?

29:25.778 --> 29:29.441
All right, when the bypass is in place,
and the facility is vacated,

29:29.563 --> 29:31.630
we down the sensing network.

29:35.830 --> 29:38.185
And move in through
the northern gate,

29:38.748 --> 29:40.258
courtesy...

29:42.553 --> 29:43.980
...of the lock decoder.

29:44.130 --> 29:45.130
Check.

29:45.664 --> 29:48.980
Now once we get inside, we head
straight up to the 60th floor,

29:49.080 --> 29:51.177
 make our way
to the initialization area,

29:51.277 --> 29:53.395
and hole up for 0600 hours.

29:53.665 --> 29:57.508
- Bang! Cale and Ridley arrive.
- And we appropriate their swipe cards.

29:57.608 --> 29:59.997
We also extract their
D-Lock sequences!

30:00.040 --> 30:02.552
- But I think that--
- You have got to remember that.

30:02.706 --> 30:05.888
And turn that
1980 shit down.

30:07.166 --> 30:10.913
Core containment is located deep
within the foundations of the building,

30:11.029 --> 30:13.762
surrounded by 22
medium security vaults.

30:14.044 --> 30:18.705
Now the only viable access is through
a deep corridor, negotiating a tech seal,

30:20.451 --> 30:22.819
a serious mother
of a bulkhead,

30:25.288 --> 30:28.608
and finally,
the core seal itself.

30:29.694 --> 30:34.242
All courtesy of the swipe cards
and the D-Lock sequences.

30:34.358 --> 30:37.983
The containment is the most
secure area of the building,

30:38.131 --> 30:41.194
protecting Chaank's
digital soft spot,

30:41.294 --> 30:45.967
a quad matrix of googolplectic
memory co-processors

30:46.107 --> 30:51.011
and 350 billion in
master software bonds!

30:51.111 --> 30:53.231
Aroo! Aroo!
Arooha!

30:55.507 --> 30:57.269
When you must walk,

30:58.027 --> 30:59.457
then walk.

31:01.035 --> 31:03.438
Yeah...
Now, when the job is done,

31:03.535 --> 31:06.041
we then make
a quick exit out.

31:06.077 --> 31:08.991
And hope nobody
wants to start a shootout.

31:14.552 --> 31:15.854
Yeah.

31:22.920 --> 31:24.920
John, we gotta do
something about the bitch.

31:25.080 --> 31:27.852
She's cut her own throat,
her dismissal is already being arranged,

31:27.975 --> 31:29.757
what the hell do you expect
to do about it tonight?

31:29.779 --> 31:31.729
How the fuck
should I know?

31:31.765 --> 31:34.934
You're the creative type; come up
with a car accident or something.

31:35.034 --> 31:38.214
- Oh, for chissake.
- John, we got orders of banned hardware

31:38.346 --> 31:41.216
from every blockade and
embargoed army on the planet.

31:41.340 --> 31:44.284
We are knee deep into
brain wiping ex-battle vets.

31:44.300 --> 31:46.363
That situation
is being contained.

31:46.463 --> 31:50.021
On a personal level, pertaining
directly to you and I,

31:50.161 --> 31:52.130
she is gonna
piss Dante right off.

31:52.150 --> 31:54.846
The cat is gonna tear
shit out of the pigeons!

31:54.994 --> 31:57.876
- We gotta do something about her.
- Don't you do anything about it!

31:57.914 --> 32:00.441
- I'm coming right up there. Don't--
- Fuck you.

32:22.143 --> 32:23.785
Hi, Scott!

32:28.221 --> 32:29.421
Hi.

32:32.066 --> 32:35.343
Just wanted a quick word.

32:38.932 --> 32:40.723
What do you
wanna talk about?

32:43.818 --> 32:45.178
Entropy.

32:46.077 --> 32:50.577
You know?
Order into chaos.

32:53.006 --> 32:58.418
Certainty into unpredictability.
Growth into decay.

32:58.573 --> 33:01.867
Sometimes I just like to
pile up my bricks

33:01.906 --> 33:04.866
so that I can just knock 'em
down again, that's the good bit.

33:05.701 --> 33:08.516
Look.
This is order.

33:08.639 --> 33:10.646
Straight. Truly.

33:13.517 --> 33:15.574
Now don't you think
that's more interesting?

33:17.589 --> 33:19.954
Frankly, no, it's just
a broken pencil.

33:22.354 --> 33:23.354
Oh.

33:25.854 --> 33:29.441
Well, I wanna show you
what I made.

33:31.278 --> 33:32.478
Great.

33:36.355 --> 33:44.980
This is a neuro-synaptic
remote relay controller.

33:45.998 --> 33:47.235
This button...

33:47.969 --> 33:50.424
...defaults the system
to "ON".

33:51.427 --> 33:54.737
Like a dead man's hand, though,
you have to hold it in

33:55.223 --> 33:57.797
to keep the thing
under control.

33:58.615 --> 33:59.944
What thing?

34:01.460 --> 34:03.800
Patience, dude.

34:40.364 --> 34:41.949
So what happens?

34:45.445 --> 34:46.906
Hopefully...

34:48.109 --> 34:49.260
...you die!

34:49.375 --> 34:50.574
What!

34:53.612 --> 34:55.079
The initial test
was a success,

34:55.103 --> 34:57.652
but I always think it is wise
to double check, don't you?

34:57.852 --> 34:59.466
For God's sake, Jack!

35:01.300 --> 35:04.014
Scott!
Be reasonable.

35:04.188 --> 35:08.323
You're planning
to slay my sweetie boss?

35:08.391 --> 35:12.668
You did give her
your access swiping card.

35:12.785 --> 35:14.136
She stole it!

35:17.472 --> 35:18.572
Oh.

35:18.963 --> 35:20.840
Scott, I'm sorry, I...

35:22.520 --> 35:24.187
I hadn't thought of that.

35:25.365 --> 35:26.365
Here.

35:33.342 --> 35:37.739
Don't you ever
call my girlfriend a thief!

35:39.270 --> 35:40.270
Scott.

35:41.888 --> 35:42.988
I'm sorry.

36:14.020 --> 36:15.363
What do you think?

36:17.901 --> 36:19.228
That good, huh?

36:19.573 --> 36:21.241
God, what a kick!

36:22.298 --> 36:27.650
What's it like
to feel stark terror?

36:32.296 --> 36:35.767
Order into chaos.

36:35.903 --> 36:39.890
The way of the world.

40:25.159 --> 40:27.618
We've a helluva situation, here.
<i>You've</i> got a helluva situation,

40:27.727 --> 40:29.744
you understand me?
Get over here right now.

40:29.869 --> 40:32.056
I'm in level 3PR.
Get here now!

40:34.453 --> 40:36.046
Fuck off.

41:12.400 --> 41:14.645
It's here.
It's Cale.

41:16.141 --> 41:18.208
They really never left.

41:18.812 --> 41:21.282
Change of plan.
Let's go!

41:22.460 --> 41:25.460
So I scanned the whole
goddamn building until I found him.

41:25.598 --> 41:27.586
Well, you think it could wait
until better times?

41:27.704 --> 41:29.650
It's a little late.
This could wait till morning at least.

41:29.774 --> 41:32.539
- Oh yeah? You think so?
- Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

41:37.346 --> 41:40.196
Geez...
Fire the cleaners.

41:41.083 --> 41:43.499
Yeah.
It's worse than it looks.

41:43.569 --> 41:45.841
What, the cops caught you
playing with your Hardman again?

41:45.982 --> 41:48.331
Yeah, that's it, laugh it up,
Miss Chief Executive.

41:48.455 --> 41:51.293
This is your problem.

41:55.008 --> 41:58.702
It's Ridley.
Something did that to him.

41:59.889 --> 42:01.095
Watch this, uh...

42:01.748 --> 42:04.711
I've got the security
surveillance tape.

42:07.674 --> 42:09.607
I checked
the access record.

42:12.132 --> 42:15.557
Something came
out of the vault...

42:17.602 --> 42:19.909
...and did that to him.

42:20.048 --> 42:21.248
Which vault?

42:25.665 --> 42:27.227
Which vault?

42:28.096 --> 42:29.283
Ten.

42:31.727 --> 42:33.345
Give me your card.

42:37.460 --> 42:38.846
What are you
gonna do?

42:42.431 --> 42:44.067
What are we
gonna do!

43:40.709 --> 43:44.939
<i>Swipe now. Swipe now.
Swipe now.</i>

44:02.186 --> 44:05.256
Hey, dude.
Workin' late?

44:06.615 --> 44:07.615
Yeah.

44:09.177 --> 44:10.435
Watcha doin'?

44:13.041 --> 44:15.972
Oh... budget reports.
You know, boring stuff.

44:18.711 --> 44:20.189
I hate those.

44:26.121 --> 44:27.192
All done.

44:34.193 --> 44:36.584
Did you hear about
what happened to Ridley?

44:38.623 --> 44:39.723
No.

44:43.234 --> 44:44.734
He's dead.

44:46.375 --> 44:49.821
I showed him my thing,
and it killed him.

44:56.230 --> 44:59.592
- I'm impressed.
- I knew you would be.

45:02.950 --> 45:04.923
Do you know
what this means?

45:07.727 --> 45:08.827
No?

45:10.041 --> 45:13.211
It means that
you can up me.

45:14.369 --> 45:20.977
We could be
the Demoliton Duo forever.

45:30.533 --> 45:33.598
Why don't you get the personell
hard disk, and I'll do that now?

45:42.911 --> 45:44.111
Sure.

45:51.055 --> 45:52.512
Which format is it?

45:57.607 --> 45:59.406
I thought you said
you were finished.

46:02.995 --> 46:04.095
No.

46:07.243 --> 46:09.223
Bitch!
Bitch!

46:11.367 --> 46:14.770
Bitch!
God, that was stupid!

46:14.911 --> 46:18.724
It was. Ridley's dead,
I'm in charge; you're fired.

46:26.640 --> 46:30.766
I am very disappointed.

46:31.970 --> 46:33.324
Drop it.

46:38.153 --> 46:40.285
Drop the gun.

46:51.979 --> 46:55.166
- Get your ass in there, Ho Ho.
- Who are you guys?

47:54.484 --> 47:55.776
Where's Ridley?

47:59.494 --> 48:01.061
It's a bad time.

48:02.719 --> 48:05.457
- Where's Ridley?
- He's dead!

48:06.432 --> 48:09.011
Tough bananas.

48:09.608 --> 48:11.008
No problem.

48:12.103 --> 48:16.888
The command chain will automatically
promote the next in line.

48:19.050 --> 48:21.715
W-well, I d-I don't have my card.
I-I gave it to her!

48:22.555 --> 48:23.696
Lost it.

48:23.737 --> 48:25.103
- Did ya?
- Mm.

48:28.783 --> 48:30.164
What's this, then?

48:31.203 --> 48:32.203
Huh?

48:34.157 --> 48:37.286
Write down your
D-Lock sequences, please.

48:37.478 --> 48:38.668
Sure.

48:45.011 --> 48:46.011
Thank you.

48:59.861 --> 49:01.195
See?

49:03.802 --> 49:05.677
Give me the sequence.

49:08.520 --> 49:09.620
No.

49:13.436 --> 49:14.671
Bring the Cutter.

49:19.595 --> 49:21.837
Did you ever see
that movie <i>Scarface</i> ?

49:33.549 --> 49:36.234
I know a better way
into the containment.

49:47.609 --> 49:48.782
Follow me.

49:53.887 --> 49:56.976
You're awfully keen to be
on our team all of a sudden.

49:57.369 --> 50:00.292
That bitch
just fired me.

50:02.124 --> 50:03.503
Now go watch.

50:09.111 --> 50:10.399
Hold it!

50:11.367 --> 50:14.085
This isn't taking us
to the containment.

50:15.240 --> 50:17.446
Now whatever it is
you are doing...

50:18.213 --> 50:19.180
...don't.

50:19.319 --> 50:23.015
- He knows this place inside out.
- He doesn't know everything.

50:23.131 --> 50:28.846
Check your prints. The containment
is surrounded by security vaults.

50:29.912 --> 50:31.004
So?

50:31.120 --> 50:33.793
So, don't you think
it would be a lot faster

50:33.908 --> 50:36.666
to cut through
a standard vault door,

50:36.781 --> 50:38.929
and 14 feet of concrete,

50:40.265 --> 50:44.955
and a nuke proof bulkhead and
2 inches of molybdenic composite?

50:55.240 --> 50:56.457
Nice.

52:16.345 --> 52:17.867
You know
what that means?

52:24.081 --> 52:26.816
That means the seal in
Vault Ten has been breached.

52:31.089 --> 52:34.372
Vault Ten contains
some kind of death machine.

52:37.600 --> 52:39.980
- And your friends are letting it out.
- Shut up!

52:41.270 --> 52:42.739
Warmonger.

53:20.784 --> 53:21.884
Hey!

53:25.762 --> 53:28.612
Don't worry about him.
Just get this stuff inside.

53:53.076 --> 53:54.276
Christ.

53:55.893 --> 53:58.231
Almost, but not quite.

53:59.227 --> 54:00.427
What's that?

54:01.120 --> 54:05.294
Ah. This? Backup.
I always carry backup.

54:06.631 --> 54:09.654
Why are you
wearing those glasses?

54:10.274 --> 54:16.910
Because this is
a surprise part-ay!

54:17.479 --> 54:22.510
Suurpriiiise!

54:29.208 --> 54:31.797
But you should have
come in fancy dress.

54:45.637 --> 54:48.198
Weyland!

55:03.194 --> 55:05.052
May your
spirit rise, man.

55:05.425 --> 55:07.109
It's redemption time.

55:15.592 --> 55:22.430
All I saw, was something big,
fast and fucking dangerous.

55:22.530 --> 55:24.775
- Frontline morale destroyer.
- Shut up!

55:24.898 --> 55:26.498
What does Weyland think?

55:28.611 --> 55:30.131
He's dead, man.

55:30.749 --> 55:32.306
It took him out.

55:33.058 --> 55:35.404
I'm sorry, man, I tried
to do everything I could.

55:35.461 --> 55:37.005
There was nothing more
I could do.

55:37.287 --> 55:39.007
- I swear to God--
- I've seen what this thing can do!

55:39.131 --> 55:40.831
- Shut the fuck up!
- We have to take him down!

55:40.923 --> 55:43.971
Yutani, you calm down now.
You're out of line.

55:44.223 --> 55:46.800
- Calm down!
- Listen to me! Fuck you!

55:46.900 --> 55:50.445
- You fuckin' idiot!
- Calm the fuck down!

55:50.683 --> 55:51.974
You listen to me!

55:54.077 --> 55:56.539
- Yutani, you're out of line!
- I'm out of line?

55:57.693 --> 55:59.793
<i>Excuse me?
Uhm... Hey.</i>

56:00.042 --> 56:01.515
<i>STOP!</i>

56:03.618 --> 56:05.536
<i>Dudes! Dudette.</i>

56:07.211 --> 56:09.924
<i>I guess that you're all
pretty concerned at this point,</i>

56:09.963 --> 56:12.154
<i>but then again, hey...
Who wouldn't be?</i>

56:12.201 --> 56:14.374
<i>Because, uh...
Oh! Wait, folks.</i>

56:14.474 --> 56:19.230
<i>This late breaking
news flash just in:</i>

56:19.354 --> 56:24.705
<i>There is a psycho
death bot on the loose.</i>

56:30.004 --> 56:32.630
There is, however,
a way out.

56:32.730 --> 56:35.934
All it takes is for Cale
to agree to...

56:36.898 --> 56:37.663
One:

56:37.744 --> 56:40.659
<i>Reinstate my access.</i>

56:41.153 --> 56:42.034
<i>Two:</i>

56:42.647 --> 56:46.304
<i>Forget everything that's
happened here tonight, and three:</i>

56:46.404 --> 56:47.604
<i>Agree to...</i>

56:49.287 --> 56:52.618
<i>...interface with me
on a regular basis.</i>

56:52.757 --> 56:56.157
- <i>All you need to do is sign.</i>
- Yeah, sign my ass.

56:56.257 --> 56:58.435
Ooh, God! That's
a sharp comeback.

56:58.575 --> 57:01.915
Is that how you reacted
when David divorced you?

57:02.236 --> 57:04.168
- What?
- I said:

57:04.308 --> 57:09.118
<i>Is that how you reacted
when David divorced you?</i>

57:09.192 --> 57:11.179
What the hell is this?
Fuckin' Oprah Winfrey?

57:11.232 --> 57:16.154
Oprah? John, we are
talking quality, here!

57:16.254 --> 57:18.944
We are talking Gerraldo!

57:21.692 --> 57:23.590
<i>Cale?
Miss Cale.</i>

57:24.852 --> 57:28.147
<i>I realize that this is
extremely difficult for you,</i>

57:28.369 --> 57:34.121
<i>but how did you feel
when your family disowned you?</i>

57:34.245 --> 57:37.017
- <i>In print, no less.</i>
- That's bullshit!

57:37.310 --> 57:39.232
Wrong answer.

57:39.421 --> 57:43.341
The correct answer is:
It's all in the files.

57:43.426 --> 57:44.626
Except...

57:45.996 --> 57:51.292
<i>...why?
Why did they do that to you?</i>

57:52.293 --> 57:59.321
<i>What did you do
that was so bad?</i>

58:07.146 --> 58:10.453
That's it, man, we're out of here.
Beta retreat.

58:10.610 --> 58:12.660
Hey, hey! What about us?
Wa-wait, loo-look!

58:12.869 --> 58:16.142
What about you, Ho Ho?
It's your problem, you deal with it.

58:16.266 --> 58:18.321
It's not our problem,
we had nothing to do with this!

58:18.477 --> 58:20.296
Nothing! Right, Cale?
Tell him!

58:25.586 --> 58:28.261
Wa-wait, loo-look! What about
compassion, huh?

58:28.261 --> 58:31.861
Or human mercy, huh?
Think about it at least, for God's sake!

58:34.736 --> 58:36.739
So tag along,
moosehead.

58:38.652 --> 58:40.605
We ain't gonna
look out for ya.

58:49.210 --> 58:52.679
- Sure this is the right way?
- Yeah, two more offices. That way.

59:03.556 --> 59:06.653
What are you, a one-man
percussion section or something?

59:08.589 --> 59:09.829
Move it.

59:12.251 --> 59:13.790
<i>Engine quiet.</i>

59:21.164 --> 59:22.470
All right, stand back.

59:36.527 --> 59:37.527
Hold it.

59:38.883 --> 59:42.303
A Category One fire alert
would close blast doors.

59:42.427 --> 59:43.927
All over the building.

59:44.060 --> 59:48.171
- Make problems for the machine.
- Yeah, and make problems for us.

59:51.545 --> 59:54.350
- Let's do it.
- Does anybody have a match?

59:54.474 --> 59:56.937
- Not me.
- Not me.

59:57.077 --> 01:00:02.008
Not me. But I do have
a thermic detonator.

01:00:05.338 --> 01:00:06.953
Isn't that
a little archaic?

01:00:07.678 --> 01:00:09.315
Hardwire D.C.

01:00:10.759 --> 01:00:12.143
Can't be jammed.

01:00:27.786 --> 01:00:28.886
Here.

01:00:29.761 --> 01:00:31.918
What do you think
you are? Stallone?

01:00:35.954 --> 01:00:38.023
Shouldn't you put it
closer to the detector?

01:00:38.153 --> 01:00:40.696
It's a shaped charge.
Straight up.

01:00:41.198 --> 01:00:42.298
Move.

01:00:45.247 --> 01:00:47.347
What are you carrying around
a det for, anyway?

01:00:47.403 --> 01:00:49.574
Once we got to the core,
we were gonna pile everything

01:00:49.613 --> 01:00:51.497
right up to into
the middle of that vault,

01:00:51.615 --> 01:00:53.617
and then blow
the shit out of it.

01:00:53.747 --> 01:00:56.917
- And steal all the money.
- No, we were gonna blow that up, too.

01:00:57.048 --> 01:00:58.314
Dead battery.
Another.

01:00:59.033 --> 01:01:00.567
Why were you gonna
blow up the money?

01:01:00.771 --> 01:01:03.210
Strike a blow
for humanitarian causes.

01:01:03.344 --> 01:01:06.091
Put as many people like you
out of business as we can.

01:01:06.124 --> 01:01:08.914
People like me? I'm not
the armed raid around here.

01:01:09.697 --> 01:01:11.113
Neither are we, honey.

01:01:15.170 --> 01:01:17.341
- Blanks?
- That's right.

01:01:17.437 --> 01:01:19.359
Not a live round
between us.

01:01:21.083 --> 01:01:23.927
Great!
Terrific!

01:01:24.056 --> 01:01:26.926
I'm being protected
by the Three Stooges!

01:01:27.553 --> 01:01:31.049
- Minus one.
- Hey, fuck you, Ho Ho!

01:01:32.898 --> 01:01:35.350
You guessed it.
Humanist Alliance.

01:01:37.763 --> 01:01:39.093
We're the good guys.

01:02:22.090 --> 01:02:23.377
What's the problem?

01:02:24.118 --> 01:02:27.567
- No power.
- Explosion must have ruptured those feeds.

01:02:28.031 --> 01:02:29.231
That's it!

01:02:30.158 --> 01:02:32.689
Time to change
the game plan...

01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:34.518
...treehuggers.

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:37.676
Why did you leave that
lying around?

01:02:38.310 --> 01:02:41.282
You knew Ho Ho was gonna
turn out to be the fat, sweaty,

01:02:41.422 --> 01:02:43.262
desperate psycho!

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:46.202
- You gave him the knife.
- Oh, really mature.

01:02:46.474 --> 01:02:48.752
Well, Big Boy
has got a gun now.

01:02:49.354 --> 01:02:52.658
A real gun.
Real bullets.

01:02:53.128 --> 01:02:55.961
And he's not gonna
let you play with it.

01:02:56.741 --> 01:02:58.590
Come on, kids!
Everybody out.

01:03:04.662 --> 01:03:05.701
Suck me.

01:03:08.952 --> 01:03:10.669
Listen up, children.

01:03:11.242 --> 01:03:16.714
We're all going down the service elevator.
And when going into a deep, dark hole,

01:03:16.853 --> 01:03:20.777
a smart boy always pushes
a couple of canaries ahead of him.

01:03:21.826 --> 01:03:22.926
Shall we?

01:04:13.732 --> 01:04:16.873
Nothing personal,
You understand.

01:04:23.461 --> 01:04:29.725
I hope this, uh... this won't
affect our professional relationship.

01:04:43.027 --> 01:04:45.495
What'd you do? Huh?
What did you do!

01:04:46.468 --> 01:04:48.622
What are you up to, huh?
What'd you do?

01:04:48.746 --> 01:04:51.362
- Nothing!
- Nothing? Nothing?

01:04:51.616 --> 01:04:55.903
If you're not up to anything,
then why aren't we going down?

01:05:30.134 --> 01:05:31.134
No!

01:05:46.745 --> 01:05:48.062
It's pinned me down!

01:06:25.515 --> 01:06:26.640
Hit the button!

01:06:28.570 --> 01:06:30.092
Press the button!

01:06:35.005 --> 01:06:36.926
Hit the button!

01:08:09.586 --> 01:08:11.101
Christ.

01:08:17.711 --> 01:08:20.885
- Do we have any more explosives?
- Nada.

01:08:22.203 --> 01:08:23.538
Flairs, dets?

01:08:25.504 --> 01:08:27.452
Does anybody
have a cigarette?

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:30.872
We have nothing.

01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.616
How ya doin'?

01:08:39.465 --> 01:08:40.522
Uhm...

01:08:40.808 --> 01:08:43.113
We're gonna need a bandage
or something here.

01:08:58.656 --> 01:08:59.862
You're the man.

01:09:04.866 --> 01:09:06.444
What are you lookng at?
Look...

01:09:06.636 --> 01:09:08.859
We didn't expect trouble,
you know?

01:09:09.372 --> 01:09:12.768
We're just a caring,
humane attack squad.

01:09:12.983 --> 01:09:16.926
- Well, you got guts.
- You spelling that D-U-M-B?

01:09:18.662 --> 01:09:20.118
What is this place?

01:09:27.585 --> 01:09:29.354
I don't know.
Give me my card.

01:09:39.189 --> 01:09:42.055
- <i>Access denied.</i>
- Come on, I'm Chief Executive.

01:09:44.676 --> 01:09:46.153
<i>Access denied.</i>

01:09:46.203 --> 01:09:49.492
All right, let me try the old
Ho Ho Execu-card.

01:09:55.803 --> 01:09:57.236
<i>Welcome.</i>

01:09:58.684 --> 01:10:01.940
Well... so much for
job description, huh?

01:11:20.285 --> 01:11:22.326
Imagine getting
strapped into this.

01:11:32.573 --> 01:11:35.540
- Nice shades, huh?
- Yeah.

01:12:09.725 --> 01:12:11.152
Cryonics.

01:12:32.058 --> 01:12:33.542
They're just kids.

01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:38.372
What is going on here?

01:12:39.293 --> 01:12:41.641
This is Chaank's
weapon of the future.

01:12:43.688 --> 01:12:47.549
You take an injured war vet,
make sure he's listed MIA,

01:12:50.176 --> 01:12:51.794
and erase his mind.

01:12:58.447 --> 01:13:01.209
Pump up his violent nature
and program him with knowledge

01:13:01.302 --> 01:13:03.769
of every weapon and
fighting skill you can think of.

01:13:04.021 --> 01:13:06.769
He becomes
the ultimate fighting unit.

01:13:07.452 --> 01:13:10.468
No mercy. No pity.
No fear.

01:13:12.411 --> 01:13:14.371
Man and machine
indivisible.

01:13:16.147 --> 01:13:17.347
Shame.

01:13:20.905 --> 01:13:22.957
I was beginning
to like you.

01:13:26.006 --> 01:13:28.819
<i>We've completed
preliminary cerebral load.</i>

01:13:28.898 --> 01:13:31.401
<i>This is the first test
of its effectiveness.</i>

01:13:31.543 --> 01:13:32.643
<i>C'mon, hit it.</i>

01:13:37.068 --> 01:13:39.864
<i>Okay, okay, kay, kay, kay.
Turn it off, t-t-turn it off.</i>

01:13:39.923 --> 01:13:44.390
<i>I-I think I know
what I did wrong. I think...</i>

01:13:44.662 --> 01:13:46.382
<i>This is gonna work!</i>

01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:49.318
<i>I said
turn the camera off!</i>

01:13:55.181 --> 01:13:57.162
I would've stopped this
had I known about it.

01:13:59.686 --> 01:14:01.624
Yeah, sure,
I believe you.

01:14:03.711 --> 01:14:06.071
I didn't know about tihs
until now!

01:14:06.129 --> 01:14:07.465
Sure!

01:14:09.146 --> 01:14:11.846
- What do we do now?
- Call the syndicators!

01:14:11.895 --> 01:14:13.251
Call the networks!

01:14:14.941 --> 01:14:18.578
911, call now.
I'm on your side.

01:14:20.382 --> 01:14:24.332
<i>...and, we got a little bit
of a situation happening, uhm...</i>

01:14:24.456 --> 01:14:26.546
<i>I'm in, uh, t-the lab here,
the covert lab,</i>

01:14:26.670 --> 01:14:32.996
<i>and I just found a whole bunch
of bodies, and sort of freezer type things.</i>

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.130
So let me
get this straight.

01:14:35.178 --> 01:14:37.393
You say you have proof
that the Chaank Corporation

01:14:37.538 --> 01:14:40.272
is involved in
illegal weapons projects?

01:14:40.705 --> 01:14:42.517
<i>I mean, I know
that sounds far fetched...</i>

01:14:42.641 --> 01:14:47.167
But a homicidal maniac monster
has got you trapped on the 65th floor!

01:14:47.334 --> 01:14:49.376
<i>It's... It's messy.
And, uh--</i>

01:14:49.492 --> 01:14:52.111
While you're up there,
say hello to Elvis for me, okay?

01:14:53.947 --> 01:14:57.246
- We're on our own.
- <i>Hey! I am here.</i>

01:14:57.321 --> 01:15:01.115
<i>No you're not! And besides
that, you little freak,</i>

01:15:01.139 --> 01:15:04.431
- <i>I'm gonna cut your eye out!</i>
- How does he know where we are?

01:15:04.852 --> 01:15:08.673
- He doesn't.
- <i>Wrong. You are in the covert lab.</i>

01:15:08.701 --> 01:15:11.108
<i>Turning me off
won't turn you off.</i>

01:15:11.194 --> 01:15:13.394
<i>I me-I mean
"won't turn me off."</i>

01:15:17.408 --> 01:15:21.924
Lifesign transmitter.
Emits a local beacon pulse.

01:15:22.135 --> 01:15:23.911
It's how he knows
where we are.

01:15:41.103 --> 01:15:42.479
Yeah, do it.

01:15:59.669 --> 01:16:00.826
Give me this one.

01:16:02.554 --> 01:16:03.688
Okay.

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:06.083
Let's go.

01:16:07.710 --> 01:16:08.715
<i>Ah!</i>

01:16:09.004 --> 01:16:13.728
<i>Not so fast, troops.
You still need the password.</i>

01:16:34.804 --> 01:16:38.978
<i>One mean mother.</i>

01:16:39.265 --> 01:16:41.639
<i>You wanna know
what the neatest thing is?</i>

01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:47.333
<i>Enhanced Pheromone Tracing.
That's what the keys are.</i>

01:16:47.383 --> 01:16:49.955
- What does that mean?
- It keys on fear.

01:16:50.079 --> 01:16:54.464
<i>The more afraid you are,
the sharper its trace.</i>

01:16:55.551 --> 01:17:00.721
<i>Access Amnesia Interface;
still a deal in talk.</i>

01:17:00.869 --> 01:17:03.586
<i>I wanna
talk to Cale alone.</i>

01:17:05.060 --> 01:17:07.928
- Okay.
- <i>Yessss!</i>

01:17:08.138 --> 01:17:09.581
It's not okay.

01:17:10.592 --> 01:17:13.085
Yeah?
Go fax yourself.

01:17:17.807 --> 01:17:19.708
<i>Very funny!</i>

01:17:19.833 --> 01:17:23.863
<i>How smart are you gonna be when
the Warbeast chews your head off?</i>

01:17:23.953 --> 01:17:27.236
<i>You wanna live?
You've got to stop being afraid!</i>

01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:30.096
<i>How are you gonna
manage that, wise guy?</i>

01:17:30.185 --> 01:17:32.736
<i>How are you gonna fight
being eaten alive?</i>

01:17:33.229 --> 01:17:34.559
No problem.

01:17:36.423 --> 01:17:37.709
Suit me up.

01:17:55.737 --> 01:17:58.930
- I should be doing this.
- Who'd set up the computer?

01:17:59.314 --> 01:18:02.397
Look, you broke achievement
records at Cal-Tech,

01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:04.211
I delievered
extra pepperoni.

01:18:04.351 --> 01:18:05.776
- How'd you know that?
- Uhnn...

01:18:05.909 --> 01:18:07.891
- Why didn't you volunteer?
- I did!

01:18:08.873 --> 01:18:10.856
- He pulled rank.
- I get the duty.

01:19:09.384 --> 01:19:10.691
Nice.

01:19:19.778 --> 01:19:22.139
You sure this process
is reversible?

01:19:22.585 --> 01:19:26.414
It'll save your personality to disk.
I can load it back any time.

01:19:26.954 --> 01:19:29.898
Yeah? You better
make it a big disk.

01:19:45.643 --> 01:19:48.586
- Ready?
- Ready.

01:19:49.078 --> 01:19:52.356
The arrogant dragon will
learn to repent, my friend.

01:19:53.367 --> 01:19:54.921
Absolutely.

01:19:56.152 --> 01:19:57.832
Careful out there.

01:19:58.202 --> 01:20:00.591
Oh, wait a minute,
I got something to say.

01:20:02.250 --> 01:20:04.254
I'll be back.

01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:13.437
I'll keep it
close to my heart.

01:21:14.725 --> 01:21:16.251
Remain here!

01:21:27.764 --> 01:21:31.438
Excecuting combat
objective now!

01:22:36.909 --> 01:22:39.563
This area is secure!

01:23:00.023 --> 01:23:01.997
Okay, we've got two
choices here.

01:23:02.169 --> 01:23:05.802
One: We hole up here and hope
he beats the crap out of it.

01:23:06.198 --> 01:23:09.064
No way.
No more hiding.

01:23:10.142 --> 01:23:11.565
Or two...

01:23:15.236 --> 01:23:16.541
Let's go.

01:23:32.127 --> 01:23:34.083
I wanna talk to you.

01:23:37.458 --> 01:23:42.216
- What do you wanna talk about.
- Parallel processing.

01:23:42.410 --> 01:23:47.669
Two units interfacing
simultaneously,

01:23:47.819 --> 01:23:52.293
with a high degree of
systemic compatibility.

01:23:52.428 --> 01:23:54.458
There's a suspicion
of corrupted data.

01:23:54.581 --> 01:23:58.249
Probably just a binary area.
You're not that fucked up, Cale.

01:24:01.572 --> 01:24:04.084
- How did you feel when you killed it?
- Killed what?

01:24:05.807 --> 01:24:08.723
I never killed anything
in my entire life!

01:24:08.864 --> 01:24:13.441
Okay, how do you feel
about household appliances?

01:24:17.147 --> 01:24:19.704
- I don't feel anything.
- Cale...

01:24:20.969 --> 01:24:24.343
You need to understand.

01:24:25.134 --> 01:24:29.994
We need to interface.
You need me.

01:24:30.345 --> 01:24:32.992
Like I need a chainsaw
up my ass.

01:24:36.387 --> 01:24:40.218
The thing is,
I read your file.

01:24:40.270 --> 01:24:44.107
It took some code, but I finally
got into Sonic Health's network,

01:24:44.194 --> 01:24:49.908
and then I got into you, which brings us
back to your sink disposal unit.

01:25:00.050 --> 01:25:05.341
I was giving, uh... her a bath.
I... only left her for a moment.

01:25:05.366 --> 01:25:08.096
But she didn't drown,
did she?

01:25:09.698 --> 01:25:11.596
I got distracted,
and I...

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:15.990
I couldn't
hear the sounds.

01:25:19.443 --> 01:25:21.381
Poor Amy.

01:25:22.177 --> 01:25:28.200
That nasty machine
at her arm all up.

01:25:28.952 --> 01:25:32.013
Chewed it right off.

01:25:32.716 --> 01:25:35.559
Child killer.

01:25:35.683 --> 01:25:39.527
It was screaming so loud
that I lost my temper.

01:25:40.177 --> 01:25:43.684
I dragged her out of the sink,
and she came away so easily.

01:25:44.711 --> 01:25:47.311
I tried to hold her,
but she slipped.

01:25:49.060 --> 01:25:53.993
She's so slippery. And I'm
holding on, but she's so slippery.

01:25:54.139 --> 01:25:57.406
And so red.
And she's falling on the ground.

01:25:58.336 --> 01:26:00.290
And I can't
hold on to her.

01:26:01.232 --> 01:26:05.120
And all the time,
she'll die in my arms.

01:26:05.212 --> 01:26:08.233
There are pieces
of her little arm in the drain.

01:26:18.224 --> 01:26:23.751
All right.
It's totally all right.

01:26:26.199 --> 01:26:27.543
We're a system.

01:26:28.339 --> 01:26:29.928
We're binary.

01:26:30.983 --> 01:26:34.950
Two interactive units
on the harddrive.

01:26:34.969 --> 01:26:36.902
One motherboard.

01:26:37.707 --> 01:26:40.021
I'll be your baby.

01:26:41.721 --> 01:26:42.929
No.

01:26:44.975 --> 01:26:49.170
- Give baby.
- I'll be your baby.

01:26:57.925 --> 01:26:59.025
No!

01:27:39.165 --> 01:27:41.101
How does that feel!

01:27:57.301 --> 01:28:01.059
I... came to save you.

01:28:02.902 --> 01:28:04.667
I don't need your saving.

01:28:06.712 --> 01:28:08.328
I just need your help.

01:28:30.273 --> 01:28:32.217
We need
to destroy it all.

01:28:38.665 --> 01:28:40.706
- How ya doin'?
- Not bad.

01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:45.852
Listen to me!
Listen to me!

01:28:46.000 --> 01:28:49.187
Your mission is still online!
You got that?

01:28:51.659 --> 01:28:53.674
Take these down
to the core containment.

01:28:55.313 --> 01:28:57.294
We're gonna blow
Chaank to hell.

01:28:58.328 --> 01:29:02.511
There's no way. There's
no way I can get past that bulkhead.

01:29:03.125 --> 01:29:05.540
That's why we gotta find Raimi
and reload him.

01:29:05.990 --> 01:29:07.578
He's got Carpenter's codes.

01:29:12.862 --> 01:29:13.962
Come on!

01:29:19.231 --> 01:29:20.993
God damn it!

01:29:48.953 --> 01:29:50.053
Come on!

01:30:14.942 --> 01:30:16.042
No!

01:30:21.268 --> 01:30:22.773
Go, go, go!

01:30:35.704 --> 01:30:36.804
Come on!

01:30:38.735 --> 01:30:39.980
Come on, come on!

01:30:53.348 --> 01:30:54.448
Come on.

01:31:06.166 --> 01:31:07.266
No!

01:31:35.513 --> 01:31:40.854
Hydraulically operated hoist!
Position: 20 floors above!

01:31:50.083 --> 01:31:51.917
Secured at the roof!

01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:54.160
Okay.

01:31:57.475 --> 01:31:59.062
Come with me!

01:32:01.443 --> 01:32:03.381
- Leave him!
- No!

01:32:03.481 --> 01:32:05.642
We must
consider him defunct!

01:32:05.680 --> 01:32:09.470
- He's not defunct, he's just injured!
- I'm okay.

01:32:09.559 --> 01:32:13.409
If one unit is safe, do not
endanger it for a potential second!

01:32:13.465 --> 01:32:18.491
We are not safe!
None of us are safe!

01:32:21.086 --> 01:32:22.658
If one unit is safe...

01:32:23.376 --> 01:32:24.806
...do not endager it...

01:32:24.853 --> 01:32:30.445
...for a potential second!
Don't! Don't! Do! Or, I don't know--

01:32:33.108 --> 01:32:35.720
All right, get this
fucking machine off him!

01:32:35.875 --> 01:32:37.504
Leave it,
he'll be completely blank!

01:32:37.652 --> 01:32:40.455
We have to load
his program first in!

01:32:42.761 --> 01:32:46.406
It... hurts... so...

01:32:50.831 --> 01:32:52.131
Follow me!

01:32:56.845 --> 01:32:58.723
And do not argue!

01:34:04.494 --> 01:34:05.794
Stay close!

01:34:32.948 --> 01:34:34.403
Next bay!

01:34:41.116 --> 01:34:44.777
Service hatch!
Our exit to the hoist!

01:35:19.632 --> 01:35:23.655
Cale! Reconnect the feeds
beneath the drum!

01:35:26.291 --> 01:35:28.024
- Yutani!
- <i>Hai!</i>

01:35:28.143 --> 01:35:31.175
Re-engage
clutch plate now!

01:36:31.010 --> 01:36:32.110
Got it!

01:36:36.017 --> 01:36:38.017
Raimi, just get
out of there.

01:36:46.915 --> 01:36:48.015
Raimi!

01:36:49.855 --> 01:36:51.197
Are you deaf?

01:36:52.726 --> 01:36:54.593
Raimi, get out of there!

01:36:56.113 --> 01:36:57.487
Quiet!

01:37:34.299 --> 01:37:36.733
<i>Hai!
Shoryuken!</i>

01:38:31.206 --> 01:38:32.315
I'm out!

01:38:32.682 --> 01:38:34.059
Now we move!

01:38:47.139 --> 01:38:48.700
Go to the hoist!

01:40:23.409 --> 01:40:24.700
Come on!

01:40:28.577 --> 01:40:30.072
Come on!

01:40:39.637 --> 01:40:42.712
- Go to the hoist!
- Not without you!

01:40:43.030 --> 01:40:44.962
Go to the--

01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:47.630
Shoot it!

01:40:49.526 --> 01:40:50.826
Help me!

01:40:55.357 --> 01:40:56.457
Help me!

01:40:58.088 --> 01:40:59.307
Come here!

01:41:41.540 --> 01:41:43.397
Come on!

01:41:53.803 --> 01:41:55.446
Go!
Come on!

01:45:05.513 --> 01:45:07.132
Directive!
Battle directive!

01:45:08.350 --> 01:45:10.888
Battle directive...
ended...

01:45:31.092 --> 01:45:33.568
What the fuck
is going on?

01:45:59.326 --> 01:46:01.879
- Have you got Carpenter's card?
- Yeah.

01:46:03.492 --> 01:46:05.899
I got the D-Lock
sequence, too.

01:46:07.377 --> 01:46:09.191
- Call me.
- Wait a minute.

01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:12.925
- This is my mission, I started it.
- Well, then let's finish it.

01:46:15.702 --> 01:46:17.210
Drop your weapon!

01:46:18.253 --> 01:46:21.574
- On the floor!
- Relax, man, I'm the one who called you!

01:46:21.674 --> 01:46:23.759
- Bullshit!
- You better call reinforcements!

01:46:23.859 --> 01:46:25.510
You better
shut the fuck up!

01:46:25.898 --> 01:46:27.173
Too bad!

01:46:29.899 --> 01:46:34.303
- This is unit 257...
- You stupid motherfucker!

01:46:34.426 --> 01:46:36.786
You've got the right
to remain silent!

01:46:53.296 --> 01:46:55.108
Holy donuts!

01:46:59.622 --> 01:47:01.244
Jesus Christ!

01:47:02.666 --> 01:47:04.283
It jumped
from the roof!

01:47:09.720 --> 01:47:11.064
This way!

01:47:30.199 --> 01:47:32.760
Come on!
Open it!

01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:37.530
Come on!
Go!

01:47:51.185 --> 01:47:52.285
Cale!

01:47:54.722 --> 01:47:56.773
Come on!
Come on!

01:47:56.861 --> 01:47:58.097
Tight grip!

01:48:46.544 --> 01:48:48.124
Sequence!

01:48:53.361 --> 01:48:54.982
- <i>Swipe now.</i>
- Ready?

01:48:55.082 --> 01:48:57.877
- Yeah!
- One, two, three - swipe!

01:48:58.378 --> 01:48:59.999
<i>Welcome.</i>

01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:20.635
How long
does this take?

01:50:39.928 --> 01:50:43.759
- One, two, three - swipe!
- <i>Welcome.</i>

01:52:42.530 --> 01:52:46.661
You should have run away
when you had the chance.

01:52:46.800 --> 01:52:49.944
Why didn't you
just go away!

01:52:52.150 --> 01:52:54.748
The needs of the many outweight
the needs of the few.

01:52:54.848 --> 01:52:57.518
That's a stupid reason!

01:52:59.150 --> 01:53:03.623
You're making me kill you
for a stupid reason!

01:53:06.931 --> 01:53:08.081
God...

01:53:16.816 --> 01:53:18.527
I thought...

01:53:21.482 --> 01:53:23.627
...we could have
a nice time.

01:53:25.783 --> 01:53:30.232
And look after each other,
and... do nice things.

01:53:33.546 --> 01:53:34.696
God!

01:53:36.136 --> 01:53:37.430
My hand hurts.

01:53:45.280 --> 01:53:46.668
Come here, Jack.

01:53:50.439 --> 01:53:51.672
Come here.

01:53:58.188 --> 01:53:59.584
Download it, Jack.

01:54:03.063 --> 01:54:05.418
You can interface
with the motherboard.

01:54:26.912 --> 01:54:29.101
What did... what did you
do that for?

01:54:32.584 --> 01:54:34.031
Show this to the cops.

01:54:36.131 --> 01:54:37.411
What's going on?

01:54:38.801 --> 01:54:42.728
- I'm leaivng you, Jack.
- Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha...

01:54:42.923 --> 01:54:45.007
Here...
Play with this.

01:54:48.737 --> 01:54:49.937
Goodbye, Jack.

01:54:51.833 --> 01:54:54.317
Don't leave me in here,
Cale, I don't like it.

01:54:59.626 --> 01:55:03.465
Cale, if you leave me in here,
I will kill you!

01:55:03.545 --> 01:55:05.698
I mean it,
you fucking bitch!

01:55:05.820 --> 01:55:07.740
And I'll
blow you to bits!

01:55:08.204 --> 01:55:09.293
Oh no.

01:55:09.632 --> 01:55:11.735
It's a hell of a
fire trap in there, man.

01:55:11.810 --> 01:55:17.120
You better listen to me!
Because I'm dangerous!

01:55:17.220 --> 01:55:19.411
Then you're in
the right business, Jack.

01:55:30.594 --> 01:55:32.905
I'm not in
this business anymore.

01:55:37.806 --> 01:55:39.592
Don't leave me in here.

01:55:39.987 --> 01:55:41.483
Mama?

01:55:43.553 --> 01:55:45.271
I don't like the dark.

01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:50.965
For all the children.
