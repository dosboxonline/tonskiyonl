WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:00.677
The following programme contains
strong language and violent scenes.

00:15.957 --> 00:19.117
- Good morning.
- UDC is going to be
in Tallinn on the 22nd

00:19.117 --> 00:22.517
We're assuming you've finished
whatever business you had in Munich?

00:24.597 --> 00:26.277
That seems like a decent assumption.

00:26.277 --> 00:27.877
Elias.

00:30.597 --> 00:33.517
Do you know what happened to
Norman after I called him?

00:33.517 --> 00:35.477
They came for him.

00:41.437 --> 00:42.997
Something went wrong in Belarus.

00:42.997 --> 00:44.997
Norman knew we were coming.
If there's a leak,

00:44.997 --> 00:47.677
it has to be investigated
and resolved.

00:47.677 --> 00:50.557
From here on, keep the circle tight.

00:50.557 --> 00:52.637
This life, it's not normal.
When are you coming back?

00:52.637 --> 00:55.837
Honestly, I don't know.
It's not good enough, Charles.

01:06.677 --> 01:09.797
Foreign Secretary. Can you comment
on the events in Germany?

01:09.797 --> 01:13.317
Manfred and Elias Fest were not only
close personal friends of mine,

01:13.317 --> 01:17.797
they were fearless defenders of
Western values and our way of life.

01:17.797 --> 01:19.477
"Are you next,
Foreign Secretary?

01:19.477 --> 01:21.277
"Are you worried
for your own safety?

01:21.277 --> 01:23.237
"What does this mean
for your party?"

01:23.237 --> 01:25.797
We have Leckner on video
with an update from the BND.

01:25.797 --> 01:28.677
"The loss of these heroic men
is a terrible tragedy for Germany,

01:28.677 --> 01:32.157
"the German people,
and for Western democracy itself.

01:32.157 --> 01:34.077
"Thank you again."

01:35.477 --> 01:37.837
"The British Foreign Secretary,
Jeremy Whitelock,

01:37.837 --> 01:40.237
"calling the murders
of Manfred and Elias Fest

01:40.237 --> 01:42.717
"a tragedy
for Western democracy itself.

01:42.717 --> 01:44.597
"Around the world, tributes have..."

01:44.597 --> 01:46.677
"Elias Fest
was murdered a few hours ago

01:46.677 --> 01:48.677
"and it will take time..."

01:48.677 --> 01:50.397
We need to talk.

01:50.397 --> 01:52.477
"However, one thing seems clear.

01:52.477 --> 01:57.717
"Elias Fest hired a professional
assassin to kill his own father.

01:57.717 --> 02:01.397
"Yeah, and apparently, he...
he failed to pay what he owed."

02:01.397 --> 02:04.317
He probably wasn't
expecting to be used as bait.

02:04.317 --> 02:06.277
"The assassin disguised himself
as a limo driver

02:06.277 --> 02:10.317
"and killed Elias
en route to his father's funeral."

02:10.317 --> 02:12.157
And we know this, how?

02:12.157 --> 02:15.237
"Elias called his head of security
er, Muller, from the limo."

02:15.237 --> 02:17.157
Was the call recorded?
"Er, no."

02:17.157 --> 02:19.357
Was it in German?
"Er, no, English."

02:19.357 --> 02:20.917
Age?

02:20.917 --> 02:23.197
"All I have at this time
is not young, not old."

02:23.197 --> 02:26.917
Did anyone get a good look at him?
"It appears not, no."

02:26.917 --> 02:30.037
"How are you getting on
with your investigation?

02:30.037 --> 02:32.077
"Your British gunmaker?"

02:32.077 --> 02:34.557
We have a lead on his brother
we're actively pursuing,

02:34.557 --> 02:37.797
although right now I'm afraid
we don't have anything

02:37.797 --> 02:40.397
significant enough to share.
"I see.

02:40.397 --> 02:43.397
"Meanwhile our assassin
has disappeared.

02:43.397 --> 02:46.837
"Police all over Europe
are looking for him."

03:17.277 --> 03:20.397
Putain! Hey!

03:26.197 --> 03:28.197
Putain!

04:40.677 --> 04:42.117

It's not official for 303.

08:08.877 --> 08:10.557
They picked up some chatter.

08:11.597 --> 08:13.037
Hm.

08:13.037 --> 08:16.837
"Rodin price point agreed.
Commencement paid.

08:16.837 --> 08:19.237
"Jackal en route."

08:20.717 --> 08:23.637
Somebody's hiring
the Jackal for another kill.

08:23.637 --> 08:27.157
Rodin? Mean anything to you?

08:27.157 --> 08:29.917
Uh-uh.
Could be the buyer?

08:29.917 --> 08:31.717
More likely the target.

08:31.717 --> 08:33.597
Where did they pick up the chatter?

08:33.597 --> 08:35.317
Wouldn't say.

08:35.317 --> 08:38.797
We need a breakthrough Bianca,
and soon.

09:30.597 --> 09:32.477
Hey?

09:32.477 --> 09:35.157
"Hey."
Hi.

09:35.157 --> 09:36.957
"Are you OK?"

09:37.997 --> 09:39.477
Mm-hm.

09:41.237 --> 09:43.517
So, er...

09:43.517 --> 09:46.357
I've been thinking
about what you said.

09:46.357 --> 09:48.557
"And I think
you were absolutely right.

09:48.557 --> 09:50.437
"I think this has all been
too much."

09:50.437 --> 09:52.597
Look, they've got me
away for a few more nights,

09:52.597 --> 09:55.277
but I was wondering

09:55.277 --> 09:59.677
if there was any chance that I could
persuade you to come to Paris.

10:01.917 --> 10:03.637
Paris?
"Yeah."

10:03.637 --> 10:05.317
"I thought I could try
and get our room

10:05.317 --> 10:08.557
"at that little place in the Marais,
the one by the Place des Vosges?

10:08.557 --> 10:11.757
"Remember? I thought we could try
and get a table at the San Martin.

10:12.797 --> 10:14.877
"We could talk."

10:14.877 --> 10:16.837
I don't know.

10:17.837 --> 10:19.837
There's a lot that I...

10:19.837 --> 10:22.397
well, that I need
to talk to you about...

10:25.317 --> 10:27.317
...that I've been afraid to.

10:28.317 --> 10:30.117
"Please come.

10:30.117 --> 10:33.037
"I checked the flights and there's
a two o'clock from Seville."

10:35.917 --> 10:37.357
Please.

10:41.037 --> 10:42.597
Alright.

10:42.597 --> 10:45.197
Was that a yes? Yeah, OK?

10:45.197 --> 10:46.597
OK.

10:46.597 --> 10:49.477
"I'll sort all the tickets
and stuff, and I'll email you.

10:49.477 --> 10:50.757
OK.

10:50.757 --> 10:52.557
I love you.

11:05.557 --> 11:08.317
Please tell me you've got something
from Sniper School?

11:08.317 --> 11:09.957
None of the names from that list

11:09.957 --> 11:12.077
have been out of the country
in the past few weeks.

11:12.077 --> 11:14.477
But there might be one
who's worth talking to.

11:14.477 --> 11:18.837
George Hands. He runs a sniper
WhatsApp group. He's obsessed.

11:18.837 --> 11:20.797
I'm gonna go talk to him now.
Ah, no.

11:20.797 --> 11:22.797
Text me the address. I'll go myself.

11:28.877 --> 11:30.957
Hey, I'm not the mole, you know.

11:31.837 --> 11:34.237
It's hardly a bloody secret, is it?

11:34.237 --> 11:35.917
Everyone's on edge.

11:35.917 --> 11:38.917
Carver's asking for access to phones
and emails of anyone

11:38.917 --> 11:41.397
that knew about Belarus.
Watch Sparrow's phone. If it moves,

11:41.397 --> 11:43.077
let me know.

12:16.037 --> 12:18.797
You're not what I was expecting.
Yeah.

12:18.797 --> 12:21.077
Get that all the time. Can I...?

12:32.957 --> 12:36.317
3,815 metres?

12:37.357 --> 12:39.597
Do you know how far that is?

12:39.597 --> 12:40.917
No.

12:40.917 --> 12:45.117
That's over two
- of your English miles.
- Two miles?

12:45.117 --> 12:46.997
Is that right?

12:46.997 --> 12:51.357
Do you know how long a bullet
- takes to travel two miles?
- Tell me.

12:51.357 --> 12:53.637
Six, seven seconds.

12:53.637 --> 12:56.117
Like, your target
can be standing by the window

12:56.117 --> 12:58.717
when you take that shot,
and be sitting on the toilet

12:58.717 --> 13:00.437
by the time the bullet shows up.

13:00.437 --> 13:03.077
- Hm.
- You see,
when you shoot at that distance,

13:03.077 --> 13:05.077
you are shooting into the future.

13:05.077 --> 13:06.397
Wow.

13:06.397 --> 13:07.877
Yeah.

13:07.877 --> 13:09.677
Now, your fella...

13:09.677 --> 13:11.997
well, he's probably very good,

13:11.997 --> 13:15.997
but he is one lucky bastard,
I tell you that.

13:18.317 --> 13:20.437
Well, if he's good...

13:20.437 --> 13:23.277
he must be British Army, right?

13:23.277 --> 13:25.277
100 percent.

13:25.277 --> 13:29.237
Could you have made that shot,
- back in the day?
- Oh yeah, course.

13:29.237 --> 13:31.557
Standing on me head.

13:31.557 --> 13:33.357
Look, I was one of the best,

13:33.357 --> 13:35.077
but two miles?

13:35.077 --> 13:37.677
I never took a shot at that range.

13:40.397 --> 13:42.837
Could anyone here have taken it?

13:44.997 --> 13:47.517
That Wilson was a total wanker.

13:47.517 --> 13:49.437
He couldn't hit a barn door
at ten yards.

13:49.437 --> 13:51.157
And Parker's in jail.

13:52.277 --> 13:54.357
Mitchell.

13:54.357 --> 13:56.157
On a good day...

13:57.157 --> 13:58.277
...nah.

13:58.277 --> 13:59.997
Nah. He was good.

13:59.997 --> 14:02.237
But, nah, it's just too far.

14:03.917 --> 14:07.517
Must have been a lot of chat
about this on your WhatsApp group.

14:07.517 --> 14:09.757
Oh, course. Its nonstop.

14:10.637 --> 14:13.277
Anyone in the group who
could have made that shot?

14:14.477 --> 14:16.437
Hold on.

14:17.637 --> 14:19.277
You?

14:19.277 --> 14:21.037
What,
are you saying they're suspects?

14:21.037 --> 14:23.477
Oh, I'm just gathering
some background.

14:23.477 --> 14:25.357
Cos none of the lads
could've done it.

14:25.357 --> 14:27.237
And even if they could,
they wouldn't.

14:27.237 --> 14:29.357
Yeah?

14:31.357 --> 14:33.357
Thanks.

14:35.277 --> 14:36.797
Cheers.

14:44.397 --> 14:46.117
The good old days.

14:46.117 --> 14:49.317
Now, we were the best.
Well, not really

14:49.317 --> 14:51.837
cos none of you
could've made that shot.

14:54.037 --> 14:55.757
There is one guy.

14:58.117 --> 14:59.717
Go on.

14:59.717 --> 15:02.237
He was at Stirling Lines.
It was after my time.

15:02.237 --> 15:05.837
But, well, he was a legend.
Who?

15:06.797 --> 15:08.557
Alexander Duggan.

15:08.557 --> 15:10.957
And where can I find him?

15:10.957 --> 15:13.517
Well, first off,
you need to take a plane to Kabul.

15:13.517 --> 15:16.757
- Kabul?
- And then you get yourself
down to Helmand.

15:16.757 --> 15:19.797
And you'll find Duggan
just outside Lashkar Gah.

15:20.757 --> 15:22.517
Bits of him, anyway.

15:22.517 --> 15:26.717
I heard Duggan was taken out
by an IED with his entire squad.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.317
Messy.

15:28.317 --> 15:29.997
So, Duggan's dead?

15:29.997 --> 15:31.677
Ten years ago.

15:32.837 --> 15:34.477
Thank you.

15:34.477 --> 15:36.397
You've been so helpful.

15:36.397 --> 15:38.197
You're welcome.

15:46.837 --> 15:49.077
The Sparrow hasn't moved
from the hotel.

15:49.077 --> 15:51.317
"What did Hands have to say?"
Get me everything you can

15:51.317 --> 15:53.877
on Alexander Duggan. Sniper.
Killed in Helmand in 2013.

15:53.877 --> 15:56.237
Well, what's the point,
if Duggan's dead?

15:56.237 --> 15:58.037
Oh, my...

15:58.037 --> 16:01.077
Damian, please just do it!
Fucking do it!

16:04.037 --> 16:07.157

Hi.

17:39.077 --> 17:40.917
OK.

17:44.277 --> 17:46.357
Couldn't get our room in the Marais,

17:46.357 --> 17:48.597
but I did managed to get us
a table at San Martin.

17:56.717 --> 17:59.637
You said you wanna talk,
so talk, or I go.

18:00.797 --> 18:02.757
And I want the truth.

18:05.957 --> 18:09.077
- I go.
- I've been lying to you
since the day that I met you.

18:13.237 --> 18:17.157
I love you, Nuria, and Carlito.
That's not a lie.

18:17.157 --> 18:19.117
And it never has been.

18:20.717 --> 18:24.037
But I knew that if I told you
the truth about myself...

18:26.397 --> 18:28.397
...then I'd lose you both.

18:30.557 --> 18:32.917
What is the truth?

18:32.917 --> 18:35.157
What do you do, Charles?

18:38.917 --> 18:41.037
I'm a trouble shooter.

18:43.237 --> 18:45.037
What does that mean?

18:45.037 --> 18:51.277
So, big companies, multi-nationals,
when they have a problem,

18:51.277 --> 18:53.157
they send me in to solve it.

18:53.157 --> 18:55.797
A problem?
Yeah.

18:55.797 --> 18:57.757
Do you kill people?

18:58.717 --> 19:00.357
No.

19:00.357 --> 19:03.277
No, I don't kill people.

19:03.277 --> 19:05.757
No. It's industrial espionage.

19:05.757 --> 19:08.877
And, usually, it's relatively
straightforward and above board.

19:08.877 --> 19:11.357
Occasionally,
it's a little more complicated.

19:11.357 --> 19:15.237
And, erm sometimes,

19:15.237 --> 19:18.517
very rarely, it's illegal.

19:18.517 --> 19:22.317
Illegal?
Sometimes I use false identities.

19:22.317 --> 19:24.637
Sometimes I buy people off.

19:26.197 --> 19:29.717
- Sounds fucking dangerous.
- The people
I work for are billionaires.

19:29.717 --> 19:32.957
The people I investigate
are billionaires.
They're all fucking dangerous.

19:43.677 --> 19:45.477
What about your son?

19:45.477 --> 19:47.437
What'd you mean?
I can't...

19:48.397 --> 19:50.157
I can't believe
you put our lives at risk.

19:50.157 --> 19:52.637
Oh, no,
I've never put your lives at risk.

19:52.637 --> 19:55.317
Nuria, I've never put
your lives at risk and-

19:55.317 --> 19:58.077
Just to be your wife,
to be your son.

19:58.077 --> 20:00.037
This is a risk for us.
Listen to me.

20:00.037 --> 20:03.157
I'm very careful,
and I'm very good at what I do.

20:03.157 --> 20:06.077
Listen, these people that hire me
they don't know anything about me,

20:06.077 --> 20:09.517
they don't know my name, and-Maybe
you don't know the risk, Charles.

20:09.517 --> 20:11.597
You say they are dangerous.
Dangerous for us.

20:11.597 --> 20:14.277
In a couple of weeks,
this is all gonna be over.

20:14.277 --> 20:17.437
It's gonna be done. I'm through.
I meant that. I'm done with it.

20:17.437 --> 20:20.797
And once this job is done,
we will have enough money

20:20.797 --> 20:22.877
to live the life that we wanna live.

20:22.877 --> 20:25.517
And it'll be a great life, Nuria.
Oh, come on.

20:27.117 --> 20:29.557
Come on.
It'll be a...

20:32.877 --> 20:35.117
It'll be a great life.

20:35.117 --> 20:37.437
The three of us.

20:38.357 --> 20:39.997
Together.

20:41.597 --> 20:43.677
Please believe me.

20:47.237 --> 20:49.117
How can I believe you?

20:53.877 --> 20:55.717
You lied to me.

20:55.717 --> 20:57.997
From the start, you lie.

20:57.997 --> 20:59.837
And now you say,

20:59.837 --> 21:03.957
"Believe me,
I don't want this anymore."

21:04.917 --> 21:06.597
How can I believe you?

21:07.517 --> 21:08.797
Tell me.

21:08.797 --> 21:10.877
How?
Because I'm here.

21:12.197 --> 21:16.397
And the only reason that
I'm here in Paris, in this hotel,

21:16.397 --> 21:19.077
in this fucking room,
is because my life is with you.

21:19.077 --> 21:20.917
And if I don't...

21:23.557 --> 21:26.557
If I don't have that,
then I don't have anything.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.197
I like you like this.

21:33.237 --> 21:35.997
Oh, for fuck's sake.

21:48.437 --> 21:50.557
When do you finish this job?

21:51.957 --> 21:54.157
Two weeks.

21:54.157 --> 21:56.717
And then, I promise you,

21:56.717 --> 22:00.437
everything will be the way
that you want it to be.

22:03.517 --> 22:05.677
No more lies, please.

22:06.677 --> 22:08.517
Please.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.877
No more lies.

22:27.401 --> 22:31.241
This Jackal is free to ply
his trade. Fine.

22:31.241 --> 22:32.841
That's liberal economics,

22:32.841 --> 22:34.961
but killing Elias Fest?

22:37.561 --> 22:39.561
Did you, or did you not,

22:39.561 --> 22:43.121
tell the Jackal not to do anything
that would endanger our project?

22:43.121 --> 22:45.521
I did. Explicitly.

22:46.601 --> 22:48.481
I think we need to find
somebody else.

22:48.481 --> 22:51.041
With respect,
did he go off piste in Munich?

22:51.041 --> 22:54.001
Yes, I understand that,
but time is short.

22:54.001 --> 22:56.161
You're not gonna find
anybody as good as the Jackal.

22:56.161 --> 22:59.241
I can get someone
from Special Forces like that.

22:59.241 --> 23:01.721
You went down that route
and it didn't work out so well,

23:01.721 --> 23:05.401
which is why Leonora came to me
- first.
- I have an update.

23:05.401 --> 23:09.401
Turns out Elias hired
the Jackal to kill Manfred.

23:09.401 --> 23:11.881
He didn't pay up,
so the Jackal killed him.

23:12.761 --> 23:14.241
OK, that's just sick.

23:14.241 --> 23:16.561
We need to get shot of this guy.
Hang on.

23:16.561 --> 23:22.041
This guy goes back to Munich,
a town that is swarming with police,

23:22.041 --> 23:24.721
to call in an unpaid debt.

23:24.721 --> 23:28.041
To me that speaks of character.

23:28.041 --> 23:30.561
Where is he now?
He should be in Tallinn.

23:30.561 --> 23:33.081
You need to find him
and stay with him.

23:34.481 --> 23:36.521
Well, that would be challenging.

23:36.521 --> 23:38.961
He's not gonna like that.
We're sticking with the Jackal

23:38.961 --> 23:41.281
because you recommended it.

23:42.481 --> 23:44.521
Is that your recommendation?

23:45.721 --> 23:47.201
It is.

23:47.201 --> 23:49.281
Well, on your head be it.

24:01.801 --> 24:04.121
There's still no movement
on Sparrow's phone.

24:04.121 --> 24:05.761
OK.

24:05.761 --> 24:07.801
See you tomorrow.

24:09.481 --> 24:12.321
I've loved you
since the first I saw you.

24:12.321 --> 24:14.681
You were the only girl for me.

24:19.161 --> 24:21.801
And when I was in jail
all those years...

24:24.241 --> 24:25.961
...you stood by me.

24:25.961 --> 24:28.281
You came to visit me every week.

24:34.361 --> 24:36.761
You were always there for me.

25:08.441 --> 25:10.681
We had a great life.

25:56.881 --> 25:58.561
Argh!

26:14.521 --> 26:15.761
Oi!

26:15.761 --> 26:17.521
Personal Protection Unit.

26:17.521 --> 26:19.641
Can I have your department number
and personal ID?

26:19.641 --> 26:22.321
"3-0-3-5-2-1-4-5-5-B."

26:23.721 --> 26:25.241
Am I speaking to Bianca?

26:25.241 --> 26:27.161
"Yep, yep, you are."
Are you in danger, Bianca?

26:27.161 --> 26:29.641
I'm being pursued by a man
with a knife.

26:29.641 --> 26:34.121
I'm leading him to Camden Lock,
north bank, south of High Street.

26:34.121 --> 26:35.761
I'm sending you the pin now.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.281
I'm connecting you now. Stand by.

26:43.721 --> 26:47.401
This is Vincent Pyne."I have an
officer in danger - Bianca Pullman.

26:47.401 --> 26:50.041
"Sending you her location."
Received.

26:50.041 --> 26:52.721
"Stand by."

26:52.721 --> 26:54.641
"Bianca!? It's me, Vince.

26:54.641 --> 26:57.361
"Where exactly are you?"
Lockride bridge.

26:57.361 --> 26:59.681
Are you in immediate danger?
"Well, he's has a knife,

26:59.681 --> 27:02.921
"and he definitely wants to kill me,
but I need this guy alive."

27:02.921 --> 27:05.081
Understood. Keep your distance
till we get there.

27:05.081 --> 27:07.201
"Is he still on you?"

27:08.241 --> 27:10.041
Hang on, he's stopped.

27:10.041 --> 27:11.801
Why has he stopped?

27:14.841 --> 27:16.881
Shit.

27:18.721 --> 27:20.241
Fuck.

27:20.241 --> 27:22.641
He's gone. He's fucking gone.

27:22.641 --> 27:24.921
"I can't lose him, Vince.
This guy's my only lead!"

27:24.921 --> 27:28.001
"OK, be careful. Stay on the line."

27:31.801 --> 27:34.881
I've got him.
North bank, heading south.

27:34.881 --> 27:39.121
- I'm going after him.
- Almost with
you. Don't do anything stupid, yeah?

27:39.121 --> 27:41.601
Larry! Larry stop!

27:41.601 --> 27:44.161
Drop the knife.

27:53.681 --> 27:56.481
Armed Police! Armed Police!
Armed Police! Armed Police!

27:56.481 --> 27:58.201
Stay where you are!
Stick your hands up!

27:58.201 --> 28:00.601
Stay where you are!
Hello, stranger.

28:00.601 --> 28:03.841
Larry, I need you to get
on the floor and drop the weapon.

28:03.841 --> 28:05.401
Larry, drop the-
Don't shoot!

28:05.401 --> 28:07.001
Fuck.

28:18.881 --> 28:20.761
Armed Police! Armed Police!

28:20.761 --> 28:22.561
Armed Police!

28:25.521 --> 28:28.921
Who the fuck is that?
She was my asset.

28:28.921 --> 28:31.001
Sparrow.

28:32.601 --> 28:34.321
Alison.

29:32.561 --> 29:35.041
Give it to me straight, doctor.
Is she gonna make it?

29:35.041 --> 29:36.921
She'll pull through.

29:36.921 --> 29:40.081
Oh, my brave soldier.

29:40.081 --> 29:42.921
Oh, fuck you.

29:42.921 --> 29:45.041
Still charming as ever.

29:45.041 --> 29:47.041
What's it like working in PPU?

29:47.041 --> 29:49.801
I've been on secondment for a year.
Waiting for my next assignment.

29:49.801 --> 29:53.321
But, you know, it's good.
I like keeping people safe.

29:54.961 --> 29:56.801
Yeah, I might need
some lessons in that.

29:56.801 --> 29:59.801
You know how it is in this game,
there's always casualties.

29:59.801 --> 30:01.801
The trick is to keep them
to a minimum.

30:03.241 --> 30:05.801
And, look, Larry's alone in London.

30:05.801 --> 30:08.601
The police are pretty certain
they'll catch him sooner or later.

30:08.601 --> 30:10.441
All done.
But...

30:11.481 --> 30:13.601
...better safe than sorry.

30:17.841 --> 30:20.561
Thanks.
'Mum! What happened to your arm?'

30:21.881 --> 30:23.041
Mum?

30:25.721 --> 30:27.321
What happened?

30:27.321 --> 30:30.361
You alright?
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

30:30.361 --> 30:33.481
Er, it's been a night, but I'm good.

30:34.401 --> 30:37.361
Jaz, why don't you go
and finish getting ready for school?

30:37.361 --> 30:40.761
I made a smoothie if you want some.
Thank you.

30:43.481 --> 30:47.441
Oh, God, yeah it's,
erm, Edinburgh today.

30:47.441 --> 30:49.761
Glasgow.
Glasgow, sorry.

30:49.761 --> 30:52.521
So, can you tell me what happened?

30:52.521 --> 30:54.361
No.

30:54.361 --> 30:56.281
OK.

30:56.281 --> 30:58.681
But when you disappear, for work,

30:58.681 --> 31:01.081
it's really hard to not imagine
worst-case scenarios.

31:01.081 --> 31:03.001
It's really not as bad as it looks.
Can we just- ?

31:03.001 --> 31:05.601
And when you say things like that,
it just shuts me out.

31:05.601 --> 31:08.761
Can we just-OK, fine, well, then,
I'll just not go to the conference.

31:08.761 --> 31:11.161
What, no, that's not what I'm-
Well, why not?

31:11.161 --> 31:13.761
I know how hard you've worked
on this paper.

31:13.761 --> 31:17.161
You are going.
Dad, you're gonna slay.

31:17.161 --> 31:19.521
OK, well, apparently,
I'm gonna "slay," so...

31:20.761 --> 31:22.641
Here.

31:22.641 --> 31:24.321
You're good. OK?

31:25.281 --> 31:27.441
OK, OK.

31:29.001 --> 31:30.361
Here.

31:30.361 --> 31:32.281
Look after your mum, love.
Yeah.

31:35.801 --> 31:37.081
Bye.

32:05.481 --> 32:07.961
Do you need to take some
personal time?

32:07.961 --> 32:10.681
No. No, I'm fine. Thank you.

32:10.681 --> 32:12.241
Good.

32:12.241 --> 32:14.121
Any new developments?

32:15.201 --> 32:17.081
No. Not yet.

32:21.321 --> 32:23.641
Bianca, I want to support you.

32:23.641 --> 32:26.441
But Larry escaping
is only just the latest.

32:27.801 --> 32:32.001
We have two field officers
dead in Belarus, an asset murdered,

32:32.001 --> 32:34.201
not to mention her daughter
who died in custody.

32:34.201 --> 32:37.521
And now we have Carver going through
everyone's phones and emails.

32:37.521 --> 32:39.441
It's horribly messy,

32:39.441 --> 32:42.401
and, unfortunately,
it all comes back to you.

32:42.401 --> 32:45.041
Oversight are already all over this.

32:46.321 --> 32:48.881
There's only so much I can do
to protect you.

32:48.881 --> 32:51.121
We need to make some progress.

32:52.361 --> 32:54.521
Vincent Pyne.

32:55.561 --> 32:58.361
We trained at Hendon together.

32:58.361 --> 33:00.281
He did close protection,

33:00.281 --> 33:01.961
advanced driver,

33:01.961 --> 33:05.241
tach adviser before he went to NCA
and ended up at Six.

33:08.401 --> 33:11.041
I need him reassigned to this op.

33:11.041 --> 33:13.161
I can trust him, Isabel.

33:16.441 --> 33:18.201
Very well.

33:18.201 --> 33:19.921
I'll do my best for you,

33:19.921 --> 33:24.201
but I am under a lot of pressure
from the Foreign Secretary.

33:24.201 --> 33:26.801
He is asking me for regular updates.

33:26.801 --> 33:29.961
So, from this point on,
you need to tell me...

33:31.041 --> 33:34.761
...every development
the minute it happens.

33:34.761 --> 33:37.081
Of course.
Bianca...

33:37.081 --> 33:38.641
every development.

34:16.881 --> 34:19.441
What?
"Norman, it's me."

34:20.361 --> 34:23.641
I know it's you
otherwise I wouldn't be calling you.

34:23.641 --> 34:26.761
"What do you want?"
I need an address.

34:29.081 --> 34:30.921
I'll talk to my man.

34:47.241 --> 34:48.681
Come on.

35:53.918 --> 35:56.878
We have intelligence
that a contract's been taken out
on your life.

35:56.878 --> 35:58.318
'Oh, really, Keith?'

35:58.318 --> 36:00.798
Of course a contract
has been taken out.

36:01.878 --> 36:04.438
Did we really think
the Ancien Regime

36:04.438 --> 36:07.198
would stand idly by
and let River flow?

36:07.198 --> 36:10.158
Sir, I have to recommend that
you do not leave the island

36:10.158 --> 36:12.238
until this is resolved.

36:12.238 --> 36:15.158
We have to be in Tallinn for the
announcement. If we pull out now,

36:15.158 --> 36:17.718
our enemies will have a field day.
You cannot go to Tallinn.

36:17.718 --> 36:20.198
The world needs River.

36:20.198 --> 36:22.118
It's bigger than all of us.
We believe

36:22.118 --> 36:23.838
they've hired
a professional assassin.

36:23.838 --> 36:26.398
Where are you getting this from?
Credible sources

36:26.398 --> 36:29.358
within the intelligence community.
Who's taken out this contract?

36:29.358 --> 36:32.598
We don't have that information, sir.
Does the assassin have a name?

36:32.598 --> 36:34.078
Unknown to us.

36:34.078 --> 36:36.478
So, you don't know
who wants him dead,

36:36.478 --> 36:38.398
and you don't know
who's taking the shot.

36:38.398 --> 36:40.918
But you want to call off an event
of this historic magnitude?

36:40.918 --> 36:43.878
Mr Charles will be
extremely vulnerable in Tallinn.

36:43.878 --> 36:46.838
You're his security.
Make sure he's secure,

36:46.838 --> 36:50.038
and let UDC be UDC.

36:51.678 --> 36:53.318
Yes, sir.

36:55.118 --> 36:57.638
"Let UDC be UDC."

36:59.718 --> 37:02.198
He'll love it.

37:09.518 --> 37:12.278
"Drone four airborne
and transmitting."

37:39.758 --> 37:41.758
Thank you.

38:12.198 --> 38:14.078
Thanks.

38:19.198 --> 38:21.078
Sorry.

38:21.078 --> 38:23.638
No worries.
I'm just gonna have to pat you down.

38:23.638 --> 38:25.518
Raise your arms.
Could you put your arms out?

38:25.518 --> 38:27.798
Do you know what?
It's probably... It's probably that.

38:27.798 --> 38:29.758
Oh, well you're allowed
to have your wallet.

38:29.758 --> 38:31.798
Just gonna check.

38:31.798 --> 38:34.758
All clear.

38:34.758 --> 38:36.718
All good.
Yeah. Here's your phone.

38:36.718 --> 38:39.118
Oh, thank you.
Enjoy the concert.

38:39.118 --> 38:40.838
I will.

40:03.238 --> 40:05.558
One non-alcoholic beer.

40:07.078 --> 40:09.038
You changed.

40:12.838 --> 40:15.478
Yeah, um... Yeah.

40:15.478 --> 40:17.678
'So, I've been
given some information.'

40:17.678 --> 40:20.678
The Jackal's been
contracted for another hit.

40:20.678 --> 40:22.918
Who's the target?
All I have is a codename -

40:22.918 --> 40:25.798
Rodin.
You don't know who it is?

40:25.798 --> 40:28.038
No. Not yet.
What's Isabel say?

40:29.198 --> 40:30.838
I haven't told her-

40:30.838 --> 40:32.998
You haven't told your boss?
What the fuck?

40:32.998 --> 40:35.718
I don't know who
I can trust right now, Vince.

40:35.718 --> 40:37.998
Especially after Belarus.

40:39.438 --> 40:41.878
So, who knew about Belarus?

40:41.878 --> 40:45.118
Er, in 303...

40:45.118 --> 40:47.518
Damian, Osi,

40:47.518 --> 40:49.798
Isabel, obviously.

40:49.798 --> 40:51.718
Carver's on the job now,

40:51.718 --> 40:54.078
so it's a full-blown mole hunt.

40:55.838 --> 40:58.158
What you gonna do about Rodin?

40:58.158 --> 40:59.798
I don't know, man.

40:59.798 --> 41:03.878
How am I supposed to find this man
if I can't trust my organisation?

41:06.118 --> 41:07.438
Yeah.

41:07.438 --> 41:09.758
Sounds like you're fucked, mate.

41:09.758 --> 41:12.878
- Really?
- So, why don't we
get you a proper drink,

41:12.878 --> 41:15.478
get a few cocktails,
maybe some shots.

41:15.478 --> 41:19.398
Erm... I've gotta get back
to my daughter, she's on her own.

41:19.398 --> 41:22.398
Where's Paul?
He's on a work trip.

41:24.358 --> 41:26.238
How's that going?

41:27.118 --> 41:30.158
The work trip?
The marriage?

41:30.158 --> 41:32.958
It's good.
"Good."

41:32.958 --> 41:34.558
Hm.

41:34.558 --> 41:36.518
What do you guys even talk about?

41:36.518 --> 41:38.278
A college professor and a gun nut?

41:38.278 --> 41:41.398
Lots of stuff.
Like what?

41:42.318 --> 41:43.678
Stuff.

41:43.678 --> 41:45.558
"Stuff."

41:46.598 --> 41:48.838
Shut up.

43:39.438 --> 43:40.998
Fuck.

43:44.158 --> 43:45.398
Fuck!

43:54.838 --> 43:56.678
Fuck!

44:37.878 --> 44:40.278
I'm sorry.
No-one's handed a phone in.

44:40.278 --> 44:41.838
Oh, fuck.
Yeah.

44:41.838 --> 44:43.478
I need that phone.

44:43.478 --> 44:45.758
Well, we all need our phones.
Yeah.

44:45.758 --> 44:48.358
Yeah, OK. Thank you.

44:48.358 --> 44:50.958
You know what? Erm, come with me.

44:58.118 --> 45:00.118
I'm gonna need your number.

45:00.118 --> 45:03.318
Yeah, shall I put it in?
Yeah. Here you go.

45:03.318 --> 45:05.198
Thank you.

45:09.598 --> 45:11.358
There you go.
Thanks.

45:14.318 --> 45:16.238
Oh. Jackpot.

45:16.238 --> 45:18.638
Encouraging.

45:20.438 --> 45:22.438
Oh, I see something.

45:22.438 --> 45:25.038
Here it is.
Oh, yeah.

45:25.038 --> 45:27.718
You are a hero. Thank you so much.

45:27.718 --> 45:30.198
You're welcome.
What's your name?

45:30.198 --> 45:33.038
Erm, Rasmus.
Rasmus.

45:33.038 --> 45:34.678
Thank you, Rasmus.

45:34.678 --> 45:36.638
I'm Peter.

45:36.638 --> 45:38.918

Jaz?

45:56.438 --> 45:58.438
Jaz?

46:00.478 --> 46:02.838
What kind of mother are you?

46:02.838 --> 46:05.118
Me and Jasmine have been
waiting for hours.

46:06.478 --> 46:09.478
I want you to see this.

46:09.478 --> 46:11.798
Ahhh!

46:11.798 --> 46:15.438

You're OK, you're OK.

46:15.438 --> 46:17.798
Here, take this. Go. Go.

46:19.598 --> 46:21.438

46:25.358 --> 46:28.118
Fuck you.
Fuck me?
