"Five hundred dollars for
the death of Chen Kuo-Wei."

01:15.475 --> 01:16.555
Hey, Friend!

01:18.225 --> 01:21.265
Your style's not bad.
But take it easy, you look beat.

01:25.025 --> 01:29.425
You must be the Four Door Fist Champion,

01:29.426 --> 01:30.602
Chen Kuo-Wei?

01:32.150 --> 01:35.540
Yes I am, and who might you be?

01:35.825 --> 01:38.018
I'm Yen Tieh-hsin.

01:40.750 --> 01:43.548
I've heard of your devil's kick,

01:43.550 --> 01:47.676
It's famous in the Kung-Fu world.
It has never been defeated...

01:49.425 --> 01:50.755
And it never will.

01:51.825 --> 01:52.979
I suppose I should warn you.

01:54.425 --> 01:57.072
I've been given good money to kill you.

01:57.875 --> 02:01.298
What the hell are you talking about?
Someone's paid you to kill me?

02:01.300 --> 02:03.530
I'll give you twice as much to kill him!

02:04.600 --> 02:08.023
You could, only my honour comes first.

02:08.025 --> 02:11.703
You must realize I'm paid to kill.
The contract's sealed.

02:11.704 --> 02:14.348
- So you must die.
- Don't be so sure of that...

02:14.350 --> 02:18.829
For I, champion of the four Door Fists,
have never yet been defeated!

02:19.600 --> 02:22.213
I don't care who you are,
I'll break every bone in your body...

02:22.215 --> 02:24.215
and send you to hell.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.700
"Wong Kei-Ying Martial Art School"

03:46.750 --> 03:47.830
Kai Hsien!

03:51.450 --> 03:55.698
- What's the matter, Master?
- I'm going out, keep an eye on them.

03:55.700 --> 03:56.740
Yes, sir.

04:04.150 --> 04:05.149
Stop!

04:07.700 --> 04:09.890
We won't practice this today.

04:10.500 --> 04:14.598
Let's practice the Fist of Five Styles
which I taught you a few days ago.

04:14.600 --> 04:15.823
He's so lame...

04:15.825 --> 04:17.654
- Three-legged cat.
- Four-eyed rat.

04:18.225 --> 04:19.654
Start now.

04:21.125 --> 04:23.823
Dragon Sees Tiger.

04:23.825 --> 04:27.035
Tiger's rear, Snake's Tongue Darts Out.

04:27.825 --> 04:29.296
Panther Sees Fire,

04:30.050 --> 04:32.505
White Crane Spreads Wings.

04:33.500 --> 04:34.732
Hold it!

04:37.950 --> 04:42.670
Your wrists are too weak.
You can't learn it well, understand?

05:18.575 --> 05:23.729
I suppose you think that was funny,
playing tricks on your teacher!

05:23.731 --> 05:25.731
We'll see. Take that! And that!

05:26.850 --> 05:29.173
- It wasn't me!
- Who was it? Tell me.

05:29.175 --> 05:30.623
Who was it?

05:30.625 --> 05:32.341
Wong Fei-Hung.

05:38.725 --> 05:39.805
Wong Fei-Hung.

05:41.275 --> 05:44.323
Even though Master Wong is your father,

05:44.325 --> 05:46.723
you don't have a right
to cause trouble here.

05:46.725 --> 05:49.635
You think Kung-Fu
is just a performance.

05:51.025 --> 05:53.598
You're telling me my Kung-Fu is bad?

05:53.600 --> 05:56.079
Not too bad, but bad enough.

05:57.300 --> 06:00.495
Show me exactly what's wrong with it.

06:01.900 --> 06:04.173
Look at your Panther Sees Fire.

06:04.175 --> 06:05.060
Well what's wrong?

06:05.062 --> 06:08.671
You've exposed your body.
It's easy to attack you.

06:09.250 --> 06:14.331
And that Horse Stance is
bow-legged. Just a kick...

06:17.300 --> 06:19.410
and you'll fall.

06:30.775 --> 06:33.585
Shut up! Shut up you turkeys!

06:37.150 --> 06:40.323
You'd like to test your
teacher's Kung-Fu, would you?

06:40.325 --> 06:42.945
We can all learn from each other.

06:44.475 --> 06:50.431
I can stand almost anything, you bum!
But I've taken enough of this bullshit!

06:58.475 --> 07:00.875
You've exposed your body again.
Do you know that, teacher?

07:04.850 --> 07:05.930
Your hat!

07:10.100 --> 07:11.112
Here you go!

07:28.975 --> 07:30.595
Pork belly, shut up!

07:38.775 --> 07:41.049
Look! Right foot! Snake stance!

07:42.700 --> 07:45.134
Bastard!

07:52.375 --> 07:56.373
Wong Fei-Hung,
you've taught Hsien a lesson.

07:56.375 --> 07:58.373
We all feel very happy about it.

07:58.375 --> 08:01.845
He's too arrogant, I can't stand it.

08:02.400 --> 08:04.710
You really showed him!

08:11.575 --> 08:13.425
That's great...

08:14.700 --> 08:16.498
Eat more then!

08:16.500 --> 08:19.123
No, I'm talking about that girl.

08:19.125 --> 08:23.725
That perfect frame she's got.
Really sexy!

08:24.600 --> 08:25.930
- How much?
- 30 cents.

08:26.500 --> 08:28.198
Not bad!

08:28.200 --> 08:31.348
I'm willing to trade 10 years
just for a kiss by her!

08:31.350 --> 08:35.750
Kissing is for children.
I could get her to hug and kiss me.

08:36.299 --> 08:37.498
I don't believe you!

08:37.500 --> 08:40.173
You want to bet on it?
I’ll bet you a whole dinner.

08:40.174 --> 08:41.998
Deal.

08:42.000 --> 08:46.350
She's hot, she wouldn't
look at you twice!

08:47.750 --> 08:49.490
All right! A whole dinner then.

08:55.500 --> 08:56.620
Just watch.

08:57.900 --> 08:58.990
He's looking for trouble.

09:00.100 --> 09:05.900
This flower is beautiful.
Trust me, try it on.

09:06.200 --> 09:08.498
- Excuse me!
- My eye hurts.

09:08.500 --> 09:09.623
What can I do?

09:09.625 --> 09:14.875
Something got into my eye.
Help me get rid of it, miss. Please, hurry

09:16.700 --> 09:17.950
Harder.

09:20.300 --> 09:22.498
- He did it!
- Did you see that?

09:22.500 --> 09:24.252
Thanks. Snake!

09:27.100 --> 09:29.990
Don't be afraid...
I'll kill it. Don't be afraid.

09:30.725 --> 09:32.398
That's a great technique.

09:32.400 --> 09:35.398
That's great. I must try
that on your sister.

09:35.400 --> 09:37.230
What did you say? My sister?

09:40.750 --> 09:44.160
Thought you could take advantage
of my daughter, did you?

09:47.300 --> 09:51.757
Me touch her? She was asking
for it, that dumb bitch.

09:52.150 --> 09:52.998
Mother!

09:53.000 --> 09:56.048
You wanted to lay your
filthy hands on her.

09:56.050 --> 09:59.510
On her? That's a laugh.
She's much too ugly.

10:00.300 --> 10:03.643
Think you’re real smart, huh?
Well, I’ll teach you a lesson, boy.

10:15.475 --> 10:18.370
So you want to play Kung-Fu? Try this!

10:32.600 --> 10:34.049
The old bitch is tough.

10:38.100 --> 10:40.403
Come on, you guys! Hey!

10:42.200 --> 10:43.438
Some friends they make.

10:57.200 --> 11:00.449
You're nothing but a skinny old woman,
so I'll let you win.

11:00.450 --> 11:01.449
Excuse me!

11:17.050 --> 11:18.974
Watch where you’re going!

11:18.975 --> 11:20.975
Stumbling about like a drunken stooge!

11:24.900 --> 11:26.738
Antique jade!

11:27.850 --> 11:29.850
Mister, want to buy?

11:32.950 --> 11:33.951
You sure it's real?

11:34.175 --> 11:35.448
Of course.

11:35.450 --> 11:39.208
It’s a family heirloom.
It's worth the money, sir.

11:39.210 --> 11:41.698
- How much?
- 10 dollars.

11:41.700 --> 11:42.810
That's too expensive!

11:44.300 --> 11:45.299
It’s worth it!

11:47.775 --> 11:50.598
Only 10 cents?! Hey mister!

11:50.600 --> 11:55.098
Mister, I can't sell it that cheap.
Please give it back to me. It’s all I have!

11:55.100 --> 11:58.398
I couldn't sell such a
valuable piece for only 10 cents!

11:58.400 --> 12:00.156
Then I’ll keep the jade and the money.

12:01.100 --> 12:02.314
Hey, give me back my jade.

12:05.025 --> 12:08.298
Mister, you broke my jade!
Pay me back!

12:08.300 --> 12:10.898
You expect payment from me? Take this!

12:10.900 --> 12:12.598
Father...

12:12.600 --> 12:15.460
- Please, at least give me something.
- No!

12:19.675 --> 12:20.598
What happened?

12:20.600 --> 12:24.726
He's broken my jade and
then he refused to pay me!

12:28.200 --> 12:29.553
Shithead. Piss off.

12:30.600 --> 12:31.912
Who're you calling Shithead?

12:32.300 --> 12:33.420
I'm calling you!

12:36.450 --> 12:38.398
Hand over that man's money!

12:38.400 --> 12:41.373
Pay? Not before I put you in the ground.

12:41.375 --> 12:43.232
It's too bad you feel that way.

12:43.850 --> 12:48.669
There's nothing been going right today,
so you caught me in a bad mood.

12:48.669 --> 12:50.580
Now, I'm gonna have to
teach you how to pay!

13:01.300 --> 13:02.350
Get up!

13:23.300 --> 13:24.280
Wanna kill me?

13:37.850 --> 13:39.035
This is dangerous!

13:50.508 --> 13:51.988
You barely missed my knuckles!

14:00.075 --> 14:01.995
- This is for you, now get going!
- Thank you, sir.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.900
I'm doomed, I'm dead!

14:18.700 --> 14:20.480
Don't be afraid,
it's just the blunt end.

14:25.200 --> 14:27.848
I have no intention of killing you...

14:27.850 --> 14:28.849
...yet!

14:33.700 --> 14:36.030
Don't...!

14:38.000 --> 14:39.560
That one really came close.

14:40.750 --> 14:42.670
And watch what you're doing.

14:44.500 --> 14:45.499
Drop dead!

14:56.500 --> 15:01.410
Fists have no eyes, knives have no heart!
Sometimes I can hit by mistake!

15:04.625 --> 15:07.348
I chop, chop, chop... the meat!

15:07.350 --> 15:09.873
I slice, slice, slice... like a cucumber!

15:09.875 --> 15:12.832
I beat, beat, beat... you like garlic!

15:13.500 --> 15:16.180
I’m glad I came across you.
You sure have brightened my day!

15:23.000 --> 15:27.390
It’s been ages, brother.
You still look great.

15:28.400 --> 15:30.799
Your brother is old now.

15:30.800 --> 15:33.686
What a beautiful niece I’ve got.

15:34.125 --> 15:37.305
She's still a kid. Just a bit naive.

15:38.750 --> 15:39.718
Where's Fei-Hung?

15:40.200 --> 15:41.473
He went out.

15:41.475 --> 15:44.952
This naughty boy always goes out to play.
He's a young man now.

15:44.954 --> 15:46.954
I think you may not recognize him.

15:48.403 --> 15:50.383
This time, stay longer.

15:51.500 --> 15:53.110
Fei-Hung, don't go away.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.500
Come greet your auntie and cousin.

15:59.300 --> 16:00.548
Come here, now.

16:00.550 --> 16:01.620
Coming...

16:02.100 --> 16:03.100
Shit!

16:12.325 --> 16:13.395
Say hello.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.900
Auntie, cousin.

16:17.075 --> 16:18.878
- Cousin.
- Fei-Hung.

16:19.400 --> 16:20.491
What happened to your neck?

16:21.090 --> 16:23.110
I... I slept without a pillow.

16:23.650 --> 16:27.098
Without a pillow? Let me help you.

16:27.100 --> 16:31.350
- No thanks, auntie.
- Come on, relax.

16:32.600 --> 16:33.599
Auntie.

16:35.050 --> 16:36.049
Mother!

16:37.500 --> 16:38.650
Feel better now?

16:38.800 --> 16:39.900
Yes.

16:43.425 --> 16:44.698
Brother,

16:44.700 --> 16:46.991
Fei-Hung really looks smart.

16:48.650 --> 16:51.740
He's quite tactful and clever.

16:53.425 --> 16:56.300
Brother, you're really a good father.

16:56.650 --> 16:59.300
Yes, I’m very strict to him.

16:59.900 --> 17:04.390
No wonder I heard people praising
him as soon as I came here.

17:04.775 --> 17:06.998
Really? What did they say?

17:07.000 --> 17:11.223
The son of Wong Kei-Ying is very smart.

17:11.224 --> 17:12.847
He's also a man of justice.

17:14.224 --> 17:17.714
I’m very proud of him.
Come here, my son.

17:22.400 --> 17:23.400
Sit down.

17:25.500 --> 17:29.860
But there are many sex
maniacs in this village.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.348
That's right.

17:32.350 --> 17:36.023
One of them harassed your
niece on the street just now.

17:36.025 --> 17:40.048
when I went to rescue her,
he even attacked me.

17:41.425 --> 17:45.284
You mean to tell me both of you
were attacked here in my own town?

17:45.725 --> 17:46.724
Could you recognize him?

17:50.125 --> 17:52.448
As if I could forget.
Yes, I'd recognize him.

17:52.450 --> 17:54.670
Good, let's find him now.

17:55.100 --> 17:58.060
I’ll teach him a real good lesson.
Fei-Hung, come with me.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.748
Uncle! You don't have to go out.

18:01.750 --> 18:02.548
Why?

18:02.550 --> 18:05.270
That guy is right here.
He's standing in this very room.

18:05.700 --> 18:06.848
Who? Where?

18:06.850 --> 18:09.940
Standing right over there.
He's your son Wong Fei-Hung.

18:13.275 --> 18:14.274
You...

18:15.700 --> 18:16.699
You...

18:17.900 --> 18:19.390
Son-of-bitch!

18:21.550 --> 18:22.730
Kneel down!

18:23.300 --> 18:24.299
Father...

18:24.650 --> 18:26.074
You bastard!

18:26.075 --> 18:27.675
You have dishonoured me.

18:31.800 --> 18:32.799
Wong Kei-Ying!

18:35.000 --> 18:36.029
I'm doomed.

18:48.450 --> 18:49.800
Wong Kei-Ying.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.880
Master Li, what has happened?

18:52.875 --> 18:55.695
I'll tell you what.
I'm looking for your son.

18:59.625 --> 19:00.725
Why?

19:01.850 --> 19:03.438
Because he's nothing but a wild animal.

19:03.440 --> 19:08.120
He attacked my son for no reason,
breaking his legs, arms, and skull.

19:10.400 --> 19:12.541
He really beat him up.

19:13.150 --> 19:14.944
He looks like a dumpling.

19:15.300 --> 19:17.390
Wong Kei-Ying! I want justice!

19:20.450 --> 19:24.515
- You beast, I must kill you.
- No, Dad... No...

19:26.400 --> 19:27.973
Brother, you mustn't kill your own son.

19:27.975 --> 19:28.976
Yes!

19:29.300 --> 19:31.475
I must kill him, he's a disgrace!

19:33.825 --> 19:37.735
Sounds bad for a teacher of your
standing to flog his own son to death.

19:38.400 --> 19:41.780
Mr. Li didn't come to witness
how you punish your son.

19:42.150 --> 19:45.400
If he must be punished, I suggest
that Mr. Li here is quite capable.

19:47.650 --> 19:49.170
Stop him!

19:50.300 --> 19:51.665
I’m responsible for what I’ve done.

19:52.175 --> 19:53.413
So let him punish me.

19:54.200 --> 19:55.720
Take this.

19:56.500 --> 19:58.760
Now, I promise I won't fight back.

20:00.900 --> 20:02.760
You dare make fun at this time?

20:03.200 --> 20:05.900
Wong Kei-Ying, what are you gonna do?

20:06.725 --> 20:09.355
As from this moment, I disown him.

20:09.850 --> 20:13.310
This slime is no longer mine.
Do what you like with him.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.554
Mr. Li, I have a proposition.

20:18.950 --> 20:21.660
Let Fei-hung take ten strikes
without any resistance.

20:22.318 --> 20:26.690
Ten strikes should be enough.
Now, Mr. Li, do you approve?

20:29.400 --> 20:32.830
I don't need ten strikes
to kill him, three is enough.

20:35.950 --> 20:39.430
Master, listen.
I’m going to fix that squirt.

20:39.900 --> 20:43.850
Master Chao, be sure you leave
him looking just like I look now.

21:32.600 --> 21:33.798
The Divine Eight.

21:33.800 --> 21:36.631
That palm style of yours,
it's really something.

21:37.800 --> 21:38.899
I’m only getting started!

21:48.800 --> 21:49.870
I'm not dead yet!

21:57.575 --> 21:59.025
You want to cut off my posterity?

22:11.875 --> 22:12.875
Enough!

22:14.775 --> 22:16.995
You've made your ten strikes, Mr. Chow.

22:19.100 --> 22:21.200
You said you would kill
me within three strikes.

22:26.450 --> 22:27.910
Snake and Crane together.

22:30.950 --> 22:32.210
Strike the vital points.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.350
Let's try your Divine Eight again.

22:50.950 --> 22:52.400
I told you I’ve got style.

23:43.100 --> 23:44.910
Hey! My jacket's getting dirty, take it!

23:57.850 --> 24:00.340
You regret not paying
for that jade now, huh!

24:02.500 --> 24:04.630
- It's me!
- You hit your master.

24:10.700 --> 24:15.100
- Young Master, are you alright?
- Young master, are you okay?

24:27.700 --> 24:31.170
Master, now I look just like you.

24:33.400 --> 24:34.798
Wong Kei-Ying,

24:34.800 --> 24:37.973
you win with your smart tricks.

24:37.975 --> 24:38.974
I'll get you back.

24:38.975 --> 24:39.974
Let's go!

24:40.000 --> 24:41.020
You watch out!

24:41.850 --> 24:44.723
Careful with my son, hurry.

24:44.725 --> 24:46.815
- I'll get you yet!
- So don't come back!

24:48.400 --> 24:49.890
Careful, careful.

24:53.250 --> 24:56.230
He came in with one cripple
and left with two.

24:57.200 --> 25:00.173
You fight well, I give you that.

25:00.175 --> 25:02.020
- But I'll still kill you!
- Brother.

25:03.375 --> 25:06.023
It’s useless to beat him anymore.

25:06.025 --> 25:07.845
Let's punish him by Kung-Fu practice.

25:08.450 --> 25:10.448
I’ve tried with that bastard.

25:10.450 --> 25:11.373
Right!

25:11.375 --> 25:13.608
From now on, you are forbidden
to leave the house.

25:14.475 --> 25:16.254
We'll start with five
hours of Horse Stance!

26:06.700 --> 26:07.780
Now don't move.

26:09.650 --> 26:12.970
Have some more boiling water, bastard!

26:18.425 --> 26:21.934
Hey, are you comfortable?

26:25.812 --> 26:30.610
Are your legs shaking, are they aching?
You know, I feel sorry for you.

26:31.275 --> 26:33.075
Poor little chicken!

26:41.250 --> 26:44.570
You feel itchy? Want me to help you?

26:51.275 --> 26:54.605
Stop. Don't do that!

26:55.250 --> 26:59.298
I'm just carrying out my orders.
See, it's your father's idea.

26:59.300 --> 27:03.275
He says for every bowl you break,
you stay another hour,

27:03.276 --> 27:04.457
you bastard!

27:54.775 --> 27:56.875
Master, you're back!

28:01.900 --> 28:04.360
Yes, his stance appears
to be pretty steady.

28:05.100 --> 28:10.198
- Did he slack off?
- No, I’ve been watching him.

28:10.200 --> 28:11.305
Really?

28:12.650 --> 28:14.223
Finally some progress.

28:14.225 --> 28:16.755
Yes, I'm very tired.

28:17.900 --> 28:20.065
- Are you really that tired?
- I am, sir.

28:20.700 --> 28:22.699
But you've got a chair, right?

28:23.925 --> 28:28.171
What? A chair? Let me see!
Damn it, a chair...

28:30.200 --> 28:33.490
You dare cheat me
when I'm punishing you.

28:35.975 --> 28:37.775
I really can't do anything about you.

28:38.450 --> 28:41.000
I’ll ask your uncle to come
tomorrow and fix you.

28:41.475 --> 28:42.475
Who's he?

28:43.000 --> 28:44.000
Beggar So.

29:07.600 --> 29:10.044
Help me, To Tao!

29:12.450 --> 29:13.449
Hurry!

29:21.600 --> 29:23.273
Practicing your Kung-Fu upside down, huh!

29:23.275 --> 29:26.000
- I'm dying!
- Here, I brought you food.

29:30.450 --> 29:31.780
I’ll go get something to drink.

29:32.775 --> 29:34.075
My neck!

29:34.625 --> 29:35.915
Get me down, quickly.

29:49.000 --> 29:50.407
Come on, get up.

29:52.750 --> 29:54.552
You came down so quickly.

29:55.775 --> 29:56.775
Untie me!

30:05.925 --> 30:06.924
Eat this.

30:08.425 --> 30:11.533
Hey, is it true So Hui
is gonna fix you?

30:11.800 --> 30:14.670
- That's right.
- That's bad news for you.

30:14.925 --> 30:15.955
Why?

30:16.200 --> 30:17.770
Do you know anything about Beggar So?

30:19.150 --> 30:20.610
I heard he's very cruel.

30:21.525 --> 30:24.475
All his students have if not
broken arms then broken legs!

30:25.050 --> 30:26.049
Really?

30:26.050 --> 30:27.630
I'm telling you the truth.

30:28.100 --> 30:33.773
Nui was his student and you
know what happened to him?

30:33.775 --> 30:34.835
What?

30:35.600 --> 30:39.924
He lost all his teeth and hair.
His nose got twisted.

30:39.925 --> 30:41.698
Even his own father
couldn't recognize him.

30:42.000 --> 30:46.410
That monster gets pleasure out of
torturing people, he's a real sadist.

30:48.525 --> 30:52.065
- What should I do then?
- You think about it yourself.

30:53.225 --> 30:56.895
You've got to help me,
I don't know what to do!

31:06.300 --> 31:09.400
- Escape, that's the only way!
- Escape, that's the only way!

31:10.525 --> 31:12.374
You're clumsy!

31:12.375 --> 31:13.898
You should try to pay more attention!

31:13.900 --> 31:16.652
- Just go.
- I’ll leave now.

31:18.550 --> 31:20.398
"Yue He Restaurant"

31:20.400 --> 31:21.800
Sir, here are the dumplings.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.380
Please have a seat.

31:42.925 --> 31:45.198
Excuse me, do you mind if I sit here?

31:45.200 --> 31:47.260
No, sit down. Go on.

31:48.400 --> 31:52.000
You're by yourself, good.
I don't like to eat alone.

31:54.175 --> 31:55.948
The food here is very good.

31:55.950 --> 31:58.310
Everything looks and tastes great.

31:59.700 --> 32:02.400
Real good smell, really fantastic.

32:05.100 --> 32:06.120
What can I get you, sir?

32:07.200 --> 32:09.948
Why you're alone? Where's Old Shang?

32:09.950 --> 32:11.600
- What's that?
- No, go ahead, eat.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.620
What would you like to eat?

32:14.850 --> 32:16.848
A bowl of shark's fin as appetizer.

32:16.850 --> 32:19.773
- Sorry. We got no shark's fin.
- That's too bad.

32:19.775 --> 32:24.198
Then I want a roasted goose leg. The left one.
A chicken and a steamed grouper.

32:24.200 --> 32:28.398
- Sorry, we have no grouper.
- Then any fish will do.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.970
Also a stewed abalone and
shrimp noodles. Hurry!

32:33.300 --> 32:35.174
And half a catty of
Shaoxing wine, hurry!

32:35.175 --> 32:36.699
One wine!

32:37.250 --> 32:39.390
You have a great appetite.

32:40.200 --> 32:44.090
It is necessary to eat
well to become strong!

33:01.675 --> 33:05.585
Here's the left goose leg, chicken...

33:08.200 --> 33:10.910
- Half litter of Shaoxing wine.
- Yes... no thanks

33:12.100 --> 33:15.750
- Have a little wine. Be my guest.
- Really, I...

33:19.300 --> 33:23.535
Here, just taste that.

33:23.536 --> 33:25.748
Eat up!

33:25.750 --> 33:27.848
Go on, don't be shy.
Help yourself to what you want.

33:27.850 --> 33:29.850
Enjoy yourself.
Don't stand on ceremony. Here.

33:31.300 --> 33:32.340
Drink...

33:41.825 --> 33:43.098
Go ahead.

33:43.100 --> 33:44.810
I eat...

33:45.375 --> 33:46.795
Drink...

34:01.425 --> 34:03.455
You must be starving!

34:37.574 --> 34:38.605
Very nice.

35:05.800 --> 35:09.270
They sure know how to cook here.
That meal was really something.

35:10.000 --> 35:16.198
I’ll pay the bill, don't refuse me.
I’ll go and pay it now.

35:16.200 --> 35:20.323
Buy me lunch tomorrow.
I’m leaving. I’ll pay today.

35:20.325 --> 35:22.173
You must finish your dinner, okay?

35:22.175 --> 35:24.122
See you tomorrow. Bye for now.

35:25.200 --> 35:27.380
Take care, see you tomorrow.

35:29.487 --> 35:31.410
That will be exactly $1.05.

35:33.525 --> 35:34.923
Someone else will pay the bill.

35:34.925 --> 35:36.703
Really? Who?

35:39.200 --> 35:41.320
The old man over there.

35:44.925 --> 35:45.924
You know him?

35:46.850 --> 35:48.120
He's my father.

35:48.650 --> 35:49.649
Your father?

35:50.550 --> 35:52.420
How many fathers do you have?

35:53.725 --> 35:57.673
He's the boss of this
inn and I’m his son.

35:57.675 --> 35:58.931
That makes you a bastard.

36:00.700 --> 36:05.180
So you just want to eat and run?
Look there.

36:06.050 --> 36:07.100
"PAY OR DIE!"

36:15.075 --> 36:18.674
I ain't poncing meals from you.
Forgot my money, that's all.

36:18.675 --> 36:21.505
I’ll come back tomorrow
and pay you then.

36:33.169 --> 36:35.169
"PAY OR DIE!"

36:37.125 --> 36:39.143
Gorilla, beat him up!

37:03.575 --> 37:04.574
Tiger's Claw.

37:36.500 --> 37:38.870
No, hold it, stop. Let's talk.

37:40.325 --> 37:41.324
Stop it.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.746
Go ahead, beat him.

37:50.375 --> 37:52.523
I'll get back what you've eaten.

37:52.525 --> 37:52.924
Now!

37:59.900 --> 38:03.230
Roasted goose's leg. The left one.

38:06.825 --> 38:09.274
And the fish.

38:09.275 --> 38:10.529
That's enough.

38:11.500 --> 38:13.380
Also half a catty of Shaoxing wine.

38:17.875 --> 38:20.717
Now that you emptied my belly,
I feel hungry again.

38:31.450 --> 38:35.650
Hey, that's enough, or do
you want to kill the boy?

38:36.025 --> 38:39.514
No, it's not enough. He is to
do the toilet cleaning for us.

38:43.750 --> 38:45.060
You wanted something to clean?

38:52.150 --> 38:54.622
Thanks old man.

38:56.000 --> 38:59.148
Old bum! How you dare
interfere with our business!

38:59.150 --> 39:01.760
Just look how strong I am.
Watch me jump!

39:06.000 --> 39:07.070
Jump then!

39:09.850 --> 39:11.260
Now you're jumping all right!

39:39.625 --> 39:41.335
This is how to wash your face.

40:16.400 --> 40:17.399
Damn you!

40:21.175 --> 40:22.721
Stop eating!

40:25.225 --> 40:28.775
- We're friends, remember?
- Okay, let's be friends.

40:42.550 --> 40:45.660
You've got arms of iron,
but you've brains of straw.

40:47.925 --> 40:50.065
Stop that, let's get out of here!

41:01.200 --> 41:02.180
This way...

41:13.550 --> 41:14.623
You know what?

41:15.150 --> 41:17.238
I can't help wondering
how old you are.

41:18.150 --> 41:19.783
For your age, you sure are tough.

41:20.575 --> 41:21.510
A necessity.

41:22.075 --> 41:25.861
I've had to be tough to be
able to survive to this age.

41:26.275 --> 41:30.667
Just look at you.
You're weak and useless.

41:35.300 --> 41:38.098
Today was just a bad day.

41:38.100 --> 41:40.876
If I hadn't fallen into the trap,

41:41.450 --> 41:43.166
I'd have beaten them.

41:44.975 --> 41:47.382
Sounds like an excuse.

41:48.025 --> 41:52.653
I forgot to ask why you
couldn't pay for your meal.

41:53.725 --> 41:57.952
That's a long story.
Old man, may I know your name?

41:59.250 --> 42:00.050
I'm Mr. So.

42:00.675 --> 42:05.914
Hey, there's a fellow with the
same name screwing up my life!

42:07.500 --> 42:09.010
It’s all his fault!

42:10.150 --> 42:13.498
- Who are you talking about?
- He's this creep named Beggar So.

42:13.500 --> 42:15.755
My own father asked
this guy to train me.

42:15.757 --> 42:17.250
So you're afraid of him?

42:17.600 --> 42:19.560
Afraid? Of course not!

42:20.525 --> 42:21.947
I have heard rumours.

42:21.949 --> 42:25.548
He's very cunning, violent and mean.

42:25.550 --> 42:26.913
But I’ll show him!

42:28.100 --> 42:30.846
That old fart. Wait until
I see him, I’ll tear him apart.

42:32.337 --> 42:33.973
You'll show the fart, huh?

42:36.500 --> 42:38.032
Hey, just where do you come from?

42:39.200 --> 42:43.580
The sky is my roof and
I sleep where ever I may.

42:43.800 --> 42:48.160
- So you're a bum?
- Everyone calls me Beggar So.

42:49.450 --> 42:50.710
Your name is Beggar So as well?

42:52.925 --> 42:53.924
Beggar So?

42:54.200 --> 42:55.199
That's the name.

43:16.250 --> 43:19.540
That was close. Good thing I'm fast.

43:23.350 --> 43:26.640
Not fast enough!
You can't escape from me!

43:33.425 --> 43:37.595
Your father paid me well to train you
and that's what I’m going to do!

43:43.700 --> 43:45.420
How long will this take?

43:47.500 --> 43:49.698
- One day?
- One year exactly.

43:49.700 --> 43:50.780
I'll never make it!

43:59.950 --> 44:02.132
You already have your cash,
so you can relax.

44:02.975 --> 44:05.998
I wouldn't do that.
I’m going to enjoy this!

44:06.000 --> 44:06.999
I’ll see you in hell!

44:27.050 --> 44:28.055
You're strangling me.

44:36.850 --> 44:39.223
Well, you're just a stupid old fool.

44:39.225 --> 44:42.223
You're just an old beggar who likes
to pretend you're a real tiger.

44:42.225 --> 44:44.948
I’ll show you what a tiger's about!

44:57.575 --> 44:59.594
I see your tiger's got a bad paw, huh?

45:00.526 --> 45:01.531
Tiger-Fist!

45:19.175 --> 45:20.519
It’s still there!

45:37.196 --> 45:41.186
All that Kung-Fu looks like dancing.

45:41.675 --> 45:42.674
The Crane attacks!

45:44.925 --> 45:47.873
Crane's Beak. Angry Crane.

45:47.875 --> 45:48.998
Crane eats the Shrimp!

45:51.425 --> 45:55.482
- The Crane Flies.
- How's your head?

46:09.675 --> 46:11.720
Your fingers are
stronger than my teeth!

46:17.625 --> 46:18.836
I'm coming to get you!

46:21.800 --> 46:22.880
You scared me!

46:23.800 --> 46:25.392
Climbing trees to get away now, are we?

46:26.000 --> 46:29.090
What? I’m just using Monkey Kung-Fu.

46:59.225 --> 47:00.473
Ready to learn?

47:00.475 --> 47:02.848
Answer! Answer!

47:02.850 --> 47:04.850
Please stop, I want to learn.

47:06.970 --> 47:11.200
But I don't like your
style of recruitment.

47:35.100 --> 47:38.890
Let me down!
I don't want to die like this.

47:51.225 --> 47:52.974
I thought you were
supposed to be a teacher.

47:53.875 --> 47:55.875
But you are trying to kill me.

47:58.250 --> 48:02.098
All students with style
must learn how to fall.

48:02.100 --> 48:04.110
That was only your first lesson.

48:57.925 --> 48:59.315
Trying to escape?

48:59.317 --> 49:00.914
I just wanna take a piss.

49:01.475 --> 49:02.774
So do it there!

49:18.050 --> 49:20.420
From the right jar to the left jar.

49:28.750 --> 49:30.853
The back jar to the right jar.

49:33.825 --> 49:35.545
The back jar to the front jar.

49:42.850 --> 49:44.688
Left jar to the right jar.

49:46.400 --> 49:48.400
The right jar to the front jar.

49:57.150 --> 49:59.484
Left jar to right jar,
right jar to left jar.

49:59.775 --> 50:01.838
I can never finish it!

50:05.100 --> 50:06.260
Continue!

50:09.075 --> 50:11.408
This is torture. Fine!

50:38.450 --> 50:41.147
Fei-Hung! Fei-Hung!

50:54.625 --> 50:56.995
Have a good wash, you old bastard!

51:29.375 --> 51:30.796
Hey you, get out of here.

51:35.225 --> 51:36.675
Do you hear me? Are you deaf?

51:38.550 --> 51:41.126
Are you blind? Can't you see I’m busy.

51:42.600 --> 51:45.710
No hanging around you bum.
Move your ass.

51:46.625 --> 51:50.283
Is this your place?
What if I refuse to move then?

51:51.765 --> 51:54.698
A big mouth and a wet ass.

51:54.700 --> 51:56.842
It should be taught some manners.

52:01.425 --> 52:02.424
How does it feel?

52:06.400 --> 52:07.399
Nice and dry?

52:09.056 --> 52:12.756
Right you twerp! I’ll give you dry!
I’ll shove you in the head first.

52:23.750 --> 52:24.749
Come on...

52:43.350 --> 52:46.948
What's that supposed to be, Kung-Fu?
Who taught you that load of shit?

52:46.950 --> 52:48.576
Who's your master?

52:49.025 --> 52:50.475
No-one calls my father's Kung-Fu shit!

53:07.025 --> 53:10.306
Judging by that, your old
man's Kung-Fu stinks.

53:10.308 --> 53:13.340
I wouldn't ask him to clean my shoes.

53:19.150 --> 53:21.530
I think you'd better call me father.

53:21.925 --> 53:23.093
Go to hell!

53:30.625 --> 53:31.545
Sit down!

53:32.750 --> 53:34.566
Get up! Sit down again!

53:38.525 --> 53:40.465
All my dogs must obey.

53:48.750 --> 53:49.658
Quit playing!

53:59.050 --> 54:00.437
Take my shoes.

54:00.925 --> 54:01.945
What...?

54:07.050 --> 54:08.998
I don't even need to use my hands.

54:10.225 --> 54:12.742
You'd better use them, I’m not scared!

54:24.791 --> 54:25.791
Had enough?

54:26.875 --> 54:28.855
I won't stop until I send
you straight to hell!

54:42.850 --> 54:43.710
Don't come here!

54:44.075 --> 54:45.074
Ah shit!

54:45.900 --> 54:47.900
You've become a cowardly turtle!

55:03.325 --> 55:04.865
Your skull's like butter.

55:05.250 --> 55:09.295
You could study kung-fu for the rest
of your life and still not beat me.

55:24.425 --> 55:26.425
Killing a nobody like you...

55:27.075 --> 55:29.405
would only ruin my reputation.

55:29.775 --> 55:31.773
Crawl between my legs...

55:31.775 --> 55:33.615
and then go home to your pig-sty!

55:36.100 --> 55:37.099
Crawl!

56:07.050 --> 56:08.049
Wait!

56:10.575 --> 56:12.575
Aren't these your pants?

57:02.875 --> 57:05.975
Judging by that, your old
man's Kung-Fu stinks.

57:06.600 --> 57:08.230
I wouldn't ask him to clean my shoes.

57:17.575 --> 57:18.845
Your skull's like butter.

57:19.600 --> 57:23.695
You could study kung-fu for the rest
of your life and still not beat me.

57:39.950 --> 57:42.370
Killing a nobody like you...

57:42.750 --> 57:45.469
would only ruin my reputation.

57:45.471 --> 57:49.498
Crawl between my legs,
then go home to your pig-sty.

57:49.500 --> 57:50.499
Crawl!

59:06.600 --> 59:10.840
You idiot, this wine is very expensive.

59:11.125 --> 59:13.245
It smells good!

59:15.775 --> 59:19.205
Master, enjoy your wine,
I'll dry your clothes.

59:36.400 --> 59:38.790
Hey, why are you so sexy?

59:53.400 --> 59:56.574
- The clothes caught fire...
- It’s on fire!

59:59.275 --> 01:00:03.035
Oh god! You've burnt
my best cloak I have!

01:00:38.175 --> 01:00:40.035
My back!

01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:07.370
- My wrists!
- Your wrists are not strong enough.

01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:21.798
More rabbit food...
and the tea's weak & cold.

01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:22.799
Stay quiet and eat.

01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:26.773
Master, you're giving me a headache.

01:01:26.775 --> 01:01:28.055
Eat your meal.

01:01:36.250 --> 01:01:37.249
What's wrong?

01:01:37.925 --> 01:01:40.405
You're so tired you can't
even use your chopsticks?

01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:08.300
Master, I’m finished.

01:03:09.425 --> 01:03:10.905
That was quick.

01:03:11.675 --> 01:03:14.325
Now, use these smaller
cups to empty it again.

01:03:16.325 --> 01:03:17.705
Go on.

01:03:19.175 --> 01:03:22.205
I wish I'd known about this part first.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:31.080
This is killing me.

01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:38.740
- Hey, Hung...
- Yes?

01:03:40.325 --> 01:03:42.205
Crack this walnut for me.

01:03:46.449 --> 01:03:49.439
No, you break it like this.

01:03:51.450 --> 01:03:53.010
Now you try.

01:04:52.525 --> 01:04:57.105
Please, Master!
Haven't I cracked enough?

01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.800
Master, why don't we go for a walk?

01:05:01.550 --> 01:05:02.549
All right...

01:05:03.925 --> 01:05:04.835
Open now...

01:05:14.775 --> 01:05:17.125
- Master, you're good!
- Of course.

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:25.720
Observe well... place your bets!

01:05:26.175 --> 01:05:27.865
Old man, you should leave now.

01:05:28.419 --> 01:05:29.418
Leave?

01:05:30.075 --> 01:05:32.579
How can I buy good wine
with so little money?

01:05:34.650 --> 01:05:37.449
I’ve still got more money to win.

01:05:39.400 --> 01:05:44.760
Come on, bet...
Trust me, bet there!

01:05:47.025 --> 01:05:51.024
Turn it over!

01:05:51.025 --> 01:05:53.398
Hurry up!

01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:54.223
Hurry up!

01:05:54.225 --> 01:05:56.295
Turn it over!

01:05:57.575 --> 01:05:58.615
Quit shouting!

01:06:06.075 --> 01:06:10.345
You're amazing, Master. You did it again.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:13.960
That's great.

01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.799
Put down your bets.
We're getting rich. It's easy!

01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:19.800
You were lucky.

01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:22.170
I'll play with you...

01:06:23.100 --> 01:06:24.099
in one go!

01:06:24.350 --> 01:06:27.560
Right, this is my lucky day.

01:06:28.875 --> 01:06:29.745
Come on.

01:06:54.425 --> 01:06:55.725
- Choose.
- No problem.

01:07:02.825 --> 01:07:03.915
Turn it over.

01:07:14.950 --> 01:07:16.100
It's not there.

01:07:18.925 --> 01:07:22.325
You think you're quick, huh?
Well, my eyes are quicker.

01:07:27.875 --> 01:07:30.457
- So, you're trying to cheat, huh?
- So you're a swindler.

01:07:32.575 --> 01:07:35.815
Police is here, run!

01:07:45.550 --> 01:07:49.898
You're a dirty thief.
Give me back my money!

01:07:49.900 --> 01:07:53.086
You'll never get your money back!
Do you know who I am?

01:07:54.175 --> 01:07:55.625
Who cares!

01:07:56.250 --> 01:08:00.605
I’ll tell you who I am,
I’m Iron-Head Rat.

01:08:01.575 --> 01:08:02.855
I’ll show you with this brick.

01:08:05.775 --> 01:08:07.455
Very hard indeed!

01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:08.790
Scared?

01:08:10.150 --> 01:08:11.200
Hey, baldy!

01:08:12.350 --> 01:08:14.073
Give me back the money!

01:08:14.075 --> 01:08:17.153
I don't care who you are! I'll beat you.

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:22.090
I warn you, shitface,
I choose who I bury next!

01:08:22.675 --> 01:08:24.223
You don't mind to get hurt, do you?

01:08:24.225 --> 01:08:25.660
I’ll let you try my iron head!

01:08:46.399 --> 01:08:49.073
Master, his head is too hard!

01:08:49.075 --> 01:08:50.848
Don't give up!

01:08:50.850 --> 01:08:52.819
Let's see you stop my iron head!

01:09:01.475 --> 01:09:02.545
This is fun!

01:09:16.399 --> 01:09:18.439
Good, very good.

01:09:45.274 --> 01:09:48.647
Bet you never guessed you'd
end up in someone's pants!

01:10:20.125 --> 01:10:23.345
An iron hammer for an iron head?

01:10:46.175 --> 01:10:47.265
Can you take it?

01:10:50.675 --> 01:10:52.745
That's enough, please!

01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:12.290
Master, my wrists are breaking!

01:11:28.175 --> 01:11:30.045
- Lazy!
- No.

01:11:38.300 --> 01:11:41.630
My hands are gonna break!

01:11:46.525 --> 01:11:48.525
No more exercises.
Go fetch me some wine.

01:11:51.150 --> 01:11:51.923
Yes,

01:11:51.925 --> 01:11:53.625
"Ru Yi's Restaurant."

01:12:03.353 --> 01:12:04.673
Waiter!

01:12:04.675 --> 01:12:05.985
Coming. What do you want?

01:12:07.425 --> 01:12:09.948
- Some wine.
- Shall I fill it up?

01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:13.548
No, three cups will be enough.

01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:14.575
Three cups?

01:12:15.875 --> 01:12:17.795
Hurry up, don't just stand there.

01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:52.350
Damn it! Where's that
stupid boy with my wine?

01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:02.796
Idiot!

01:13:09.900 --> 01:13:10.899
That's him!

01:13:18.650 --> 01:13:20.310
Old man, who are you?

01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.760
Who's asking?

01:13:26.725 --> 01:13:29.315
Old man, have you heard
of the King of Sticks?

01:13:29.875 --> 01:13:35.785
Yes, I have. Have you ever
heard of Beggar So then?

01:13:36.425 --> 01:13:37.425
Beggar So?

01:13:38.575 --> 01:13:39.845
In person!

01:13:42.050 --> 01:13:43.010
Let's go!

01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:46.248
Don't go. He doesn't
look like Beggar So.

01:13:46.250 --> 01:13:47.309
- What?
- Look.

01:13:51.625 --> 01:13:55.185
He's trembling, he can't
be the real Beggar So.

01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:04.426
So you think you're being funny?
I’m not fooled that easily.

01:14:05.150 --> 01:14:07.860
But I’m not lying, I am Beggar So!

01:15:03.625 --> 01:15:04.798
Master.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:05.805
Give me the wine!

01:15:15.825 --> 01:15:16.915
It's water!

01:15:24.325 --> 01:15:26.335
Idiot! Now see what you've done!

01:15:58.400 --> 01:15:59.300
Master!

01:16:33.475 --> 01:16:36.773
They're lucky!
If I ever meet them again,

01:16:36.775 --> 01:16:38.705
I’ll kill them both. Let's go!

01:17:04.175 --> 01:17:06.375
Cheer up, eat something.

01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:11.450
Master, it's all my
fault you were beaten.

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:14.110
It seems bad luck follows you around.

01:17:14.825 --> 01:17:19.523
I’ve been through a lot of things,
but until this day...

01:17:19.525 --> 01:17:21.588
I've never suffered such
humiliation like that!

01:17:22.025 --> 01:17:26.210
He wasn't better than you, but you've
no strength without your wine.

01:17:27.625 --> 01:17:29.185
You sure can talk.

01:17:30.150 --> 01:17:35.790
True, but if I had been taught better,
I could've beaten that jerk.

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:39.780
You mean to say I’m not
teaching you right?

01:17:41.125 --> 01:17:46.615
You're just pushing me around.
You're teaching me how to get beaten.

01:17:53.450 --> 01:17:57.773
Your father is without question
an excellent martial arts Master.

01:17:57.775 --> 01:18:01.098
His methods are among the best.

01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:04.020
So why would he ask me
to teach you my style?

01:18:04.775 --> 01:18:06.545
He wants you to torture me.

01:18:09.150 --> 01:18:14.390
He asked me because he knows
I’ve got a secret style.

01:18:15.175 --> 01:18:16.174
What's that?

01:18:16.725 --> 01:18:18.695
The Eight Drunken Gods.

01:18:20.625 --> 01:18:24.361
It’s nothing special.
That shows your damned ignorance.

01:18:24.925 --> 01:18:31.990
Many people have asked me to teach
them but I turned them all down!

01:19:06.169 --> 01:19:10.798
Don't be fooled by my staggering,
there's power inside to kill.

01:19:10.800 --> 01:19:15.819
It looks real enough, yet it isn't.
Pretending lets you win.

01:19:36.575 --> 01:19:37.935
Clever, isn't it?

01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.790
Why haven't you shown me it before?

01:19:42.100 --> 01:19:44.573
Didn't your father tell you that...

01:19:44.575 --> 01:19:47.703
foundation is very important.

01:19:48.123 --> 01:19:53.650
I do this because I want you
to have a good foundation.

01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.823
I think you're ready now.

01:19:57.825 --> 01:19:58.773
Really?

01:19:58.775 --> 01:20:02.489
To study my style, you'll find it
easier if you have a drink first.

01:20:06.400 --> 01:20:07.650
Drink up.

01:20:15.275 --> 01:20:16.445
Have another cup.

01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.410
Fei-Hung, have you ever gone to school?

01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.740
I've spent a few years
in a private school.

01:20:30.725 --> 01:20:32.130
"Drink up the wine."

01:20:33.573 --> 01:20:36.850
- "May our cups never rest."
- "For I’ll sing you a song."

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:39.820
"I’ll put your ears to the test."

01:20:41.325 --> 01:20:47.570
"Power and wealth are no avail to us.
When only drinking prevails."

01:20:48.325 --> 01:20:50.425
Boy, enough, enough.

01:20:54.050 --> 01:20:58.330
"Sober men and sages are
lost through the ages."

01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.380
"All our brave drinkers
shall never die."

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.506
"All our brave drinkers shall never die."

01:21:06.975 --> 01:21:08.902
"Shing Fung produces
the finest of wines."

01:21:10.725 --> 01:21:13.097
"The best soldiers of Shien
Yang are always young."

01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:18.898
"Even the King couldn't
stop my drinking."

01:21:19.775 --> 01:21:22.244
"Let's drink a toast to
our ship that's sinking."

01:21:24.825 --> 01:21:27.021
"With uplifted cup,
I say to the full moon."

01:21:30.225 --> 01:21:32.168
"Why does my shadow appear to swoon?"

01:21:33.625 --> 01:21:35.855
"Wine in a radiant cup you see."

01:21:37.200 --> 01:21:40.348
"Put down that cup the
horses are awaiting thee."

01:21:40.350 --> 01:21:43.404
"Fallen on the battlefield, the
soldier says, who will remember me?"

01:21:44.650 --> 01:21:46.032
"Who will remember me?"

01:21:47.800 --> 01:21:49.277
"Who will remember me?"

01:22:00.300 --> 01:22:04.025
The God Lu, the drunkard
with inner strength.

01:22:41.225 --> 01:22:46.025
The God Li, the drunken cripple
with the powerful right leg.

01:23:12.425 --> 01:23:17.110
The God Jun, the drunkard
holding a pot in his arms.

01:23:43.950 --> 01:23:48.189
The God Lan, the drunkard with
the sudden deadly waist attack.

01:24:14.925 --> 01:24:18.703
The God Chan, the drunkard
with the swift double-kicks.

01:24:47.125 --> 01:24:50.220
The God Tso, the drunkard
with the powerful throat lock.

01:25:16.250 --> 01:25:19.551
The God Han, the drunken flute
player with powerful wrists.

01:25:39.250 --> 01:25:43.300
The God Miss Ho, the drunken
woman flaunting her body.

01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:54.370
Concentrate! This is serious.

01:25:54.950 --> 01:25:57.498
Isn't this style for women?

01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:01.119
Miss Ho is a woman, yes,
but she is strong. Watch me.

01:26:06.475 --> 01:26:07.479
Do like I do!

01:26:21.975 --> 01:26:23.395
Continue practicing!

01:26:24.150 --> 01:26:25.329
Okay, I will.

01:26:25.825 --> 01:26:26.895
Practice hard!

01:26:32.325 --> 01:26:34.465
This is for sissies. I won't do it!

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:40.680
Wong Kei-Ying!

01:26:41.275 --> 01:26:46.335
Why do you persuade the Bull Head Hill
villagers not to sell me their land?

01:26:47.125 --> 01:26:48.625
What was your reason for it?

01:26:50.575 --> 01:26:52.722
Was it because of that
business over your son?

01:26:53.100 --> 01:26:54.551
That's a personal issue.

01:26:55.025 --> 01:26:56.935
It'll be settled in good time.

01:26:57.400 --> 01:27:00.060
I'm not responsible.
What is your game?

01:27:00.875 --> 01:27:01.898
What is yours?

01:27:01.900 --> 01:27:04.092
Mr. Li, why do you want to buy the hill?

01:27:06.150 --> 01:27:07.948
As you wish to know, I'll tell you.

01:27:08.350 --> 01:27:14.430
That old graveyard up there has been haunting
us for centuries, disturbing family spirits!

01:27:15.725 --> 01:27:19.515
They'll get more than $20 per lot,
it's good money for that land.

01:27:20.025 --> 01:27:22.098
Then you butt your nose in
where it isn't wanted!

01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:24.270
You mean you want to buy the graveyard?

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:29.048
Don't you believe me?
There's a curse on the name of Li!

01:27:29.050 --> 01:27:33.323
And it must be exorcised.
I've got three mistresses without children!

01:27:33.325 --> 01:27:36.416
I'll be content with a chicken egg.
But they can't produce that!

01:27:36.925 --> 01:27:39.390
Maybe you've just become impotent.

01:27:44.975 --> 01:27:47.932
You can't hide anything
from me, Mr Li.

01:27:49.075 --> 01:27:50.505
And what's that supposed to mean?

01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:54.807
Li Wan-Hao, I think you just
want what's hidden in the hill.

01:27:56.100 --> 01:27:57.140
What would that be?

01:27:57.625 --> 01:27:59.405
- The coal.
- The coal?

01:27:59.700 --> 01:28:01.534
Bull Head Hill contains a rich coal deposit.

01:28:01.535 --> 01:28:06.668
You secretly deal with the Coal Company
to make profit from the selling of the coal.

01:28:07.775 --> 01:28:10.425
You can fool the villagers,
but you can't fool me!

01:28:15.975 --> 01:28:19.545
Since you know it, I won't deny.

01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:24.250
If you don't interfere,
I'll give you 20% of the profit.

01:28:24.950 --> 01:28:27.890
20%? You'd spend so much on me?

01:28:28.200 --> 01:28:32.300
Listen, Li Wan-hao,
the hill belongs to the villagers.

01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:35.240
No one can take it away,
get out of here!

01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:39.070
Wong Kei-Ying,
you're trying to go against me,

01:28:39.350 --> 01:28:42.408
No matter how good your Kung-Fu is,
you are going to pay for this!

01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:06.253
$1000 for the death of
Wong Kei-Ying of Fushan.

01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:10.310
Wong Kei-Ying?

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:12.810
"Teacher's Birthday Ceremony"

01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:24.748
Master.

01:29:24.750 --> 01:29:26.550
- Is everything ready for tonight?
- Yes.

01:29:31.725 --> 01:29:33.778
Hurry up, there will be
many guests tonight.

01:29:40.650 --> 01:29:42.580
Hey, Master Hsu.

01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:46.580
Big Funeral?

01:29:49.500 --> 01:29:51.199
Are you a dumb masochist?

01:29:51.200 --> 01:29:52.999
Coming here looking for more punishment?

01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:54.400
Didn't you suffer enough last time?

01:29:58.050 --> 01:30:02.248
I just wanna have something
to eat and someone to beat.

01:30:02.250 --> 01:30:04.174
Alright. I’ll make you
an extra special dish!

01:30:04.175 --> 01:30:05.898
Master, what would it be?

01:30:05.900 --> 01:30:07.499
Bamboo shoot and pork.

01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:09.497
- Go get my stick.
- Okay.

01:30:09.800 --> 01:30:10.799
Pork?

01:30:12.600 --> 01:30:13.660
I'll have a piece first.

01:30:15.600 --> 01:30:17.840
Right, it tastes good!

01:30:18.300 --> 01:30:19.299
Master.

01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:23.499
Cheers.

01:30:59.900 --> 01:31:02.330
Wow, your teeth are sharp!
They bit right through the bowl.

01:31:24.375 --> 01:31:25.374
Now what?

01:31:36.500 --> 01:31:39.770
Be careful now, toothy.
Take it easy.

01:31:50.825 --> 01:31:53.365
I did tell you to take it easy.

01:32:08.533 --> 01:32:09.533
Sit still!

01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:19.850
A fart for the King of Sticks.

01:32:30.075 --> 01:32:31.755
This is 'Hungry Dogs Eats Shit!'

01:32:32.475 --> 01:32:33.475
Not quite!

01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:40.840
You like it?

01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:05.260
He's drunk!

01:34:42.500 --> 01:34:44.860
The old man will like this.

01:34:51.500 --> 01:34:55.800
Master, the King of Sticks gave
us wine. It’s free of charge.

01:35:00.075 --> 01:35:01.075
Master.

01:35:02.375 --> 01:35:03.374
Master.

01:35:06.650 --> 01:35:07.680
Master.

01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:09.499
Master.

01:35:19.625 --> 01:35:22.123
Fei-Hong, one year has passed...

01:35:22.650 --> 01:35:27.073
and it’s time for us to
go our separate paths.

01:35:27.075 --> 01:35:31.548
I have taught you all the techniques
and the magic of kung fu.

01:35:31.550 --> 01:35:34.723
Practice diligently,
master each technique...

01:35:34.725 --> 01:35:37.725
The Eight Drunken Gods
is the ultimate Kung-Fu.

01:35:37.725 --> 01:35:41.098
My home is the world.
Try not to miss me.

01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:42.498
Go home and be a good son.

01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:47.260
Remember this, If you ever need me,
I’ll be there. Beggar So.

01:35:56.050 --> 01:35:57.598
Master...

01:35:57.600 --> 01:36:01.616
Master!

01:36:18.100 --> 01:36:19.099
Higher!

01:36:25.625 --> 01:36:27.745
- Harder!
- Master Wong!

01:36:29.550 --> 01:36:31.748
- Master Wong...
- What is it?

01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:35.458
Master Wong, Li and his men
are digging on Bull Head Hill!

01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:36.702
Really?

01:36:37.625 --> 01:36:40.455
Tell the men I’m going there. Quick!

01:36:43.650 --> 01:36:45.745
This way! Quick!

01:37:19.825 --> 01:37:20.924
Wong Kei-Ying,

01:37:20.925 --> 01:37:24.501
Your skill in Kung-Fu is
renowned, I compliment you.

01:37:26.050 --> 01:37:30.920
Who are you? I don't know you.
Why do you want to kill me?

01:37:32.325 --> 01:37:36.305
I'm Yen Tieh-hsin.
I kill for money.

01:37:36.650 --> 01:37:42.040
Today I have a worthy opponent,
I'd like to pay you my respects.

01:37:43.400 --> 01:37:48.760
I’ve heard of you. The cold-blooded
assassin who'd sell his own brother.

01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:50.750
That's me.

01:37:51.975 --> 01:37:55.948
But killing me,
you won't find that so easy.

01:37:55.950 --> 01:37:58.713
Then I suppose you'll
want to wish me luck.

01:38:19.600 --> 01:38:22.620
Hands are for door knobs
and legs break down doors.

01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:34.211
30% from the hands,
the rest are from the legs.

01:39:16.925 --> 01:39:20.315
Wong Kei-Ying. Are you
ready to meet your death?

01:39:33.650 --> 01:39:34.623
Master.

01:39:34.625 --> 01:39:36.448
Father, are you alright?

01:39:36.450 --> 01:39:38.516
Idiot, you're back?

01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.430
It’s alright. Don't be afraid. I'm here.

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.040
He dares to attack my father?
I’ll give him a good lesson!

01:39:48.150 --> 01:39:49.185
You again?

01:39:51.475 --> 01:39:55.495
Good. You can help bury
your old man, shitface.

01:39:58.250 --> 01:40:02.210
Master Wong, it's too bad
you have such a disgraceful son.

01:40:04.475 --> 01:40:06.445
You watch out, or you'll
have a body with no ass!

01:40:08.225 --> 01:40:13.355
Dumbass, go and clean pig-stys
or I’ll have to kill you too.

01:40:13.850 --> 01:40:16.392
I won't die, bastard,
but the worms'll grow fat on you!

01:40:16.675 --> 01:40:21.835
Okay, I give a discount today,
killing two for the price of one!

01:40:22.625 --> 01:40:23.625
Up yours!

01:40:27.075 --> 01:40:32.548
Wait... wait for me.

01:40:32.550 --> 01:40:34.357
Master, what are you doing here?

01:40:35.575 --> 01:40:39.321
How can Beggar So
miss a great fight?

01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:43.770
Beggar So, it's none of your business.
Go away!

01:40:44.575 --> 01:40:49.785
You are mistaken.
This is very much my business.

01:40:50.150 --> 01:40:54.707
But don't worry, I’m not
going to fight you.

01:40:55.125 --> 01:40:57.485
He is good enough to do it.

01:40:59.853 --> 01:41:01.891
Come. Drink first.

01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.798
Master, this wine is strong.
What kind is it?

01:41:46.575 --> 01:41:47.913
San Pien Wine.

01:41:48.575 --> 01:41:49.574
I’m drunk!

01:42:44.550 --> 01:42:47.890
I’m the God Lu, the drunkard
with inner strength.

01:42:59.275 --> 01:43:00.955
The cripple Li!

01:43:28.925 --> 01:43:31.856
The drunk with a strong right leg.

01:43:33.225 --> 01:43:34.295
The God Lan!

01:43:51.950 --> 01:43:56.260
A sudden attack to the waist,
the God Jun!

01:43:57.900 --> 01:44:00.380
Holding a pot in his arms,
Han's gone mad!

01:44:16.425 --> 01:44:18.915
Well done, the Eight Drunken Gods...

01:44:19.775 --> 01:44:23.365
Patience, you've not seen it all yet.

01:44:24.500 --> 01:44:25.500
The God Han.

01:44:29.950 --> 01:44:32.060
He's the flute player
with the powerful wrists.

01:45:00.450 --> 01:45:01.450
Impressive!

01:45:03.550 --> 01:45:04.890
Your flute is bent.

01:45:06.025 --> 01:45:07.024
The God Tso,

01:45:07.925 --> 01:45:11.280
- drunkard with the powerful...
- Throat Lock.

01:45:33.675 --> 01:45:35.075
Now your lock is broken.

01:45:49.575 --> 01:45:50.825
The Devil's Shadowless Hands.

01:45:52.525 --> 01:45:53.775
Yes, you're very observant.

01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:57.850
The God Chan!

01:46:04.775 --> 01:46:06.125
The God Chan won't reach old age!

01:46:23.450 --> 01:46:25.230
Where's the drunken Miss Ho?

01:46:26.300 --> 01:46:29.584
Miss Ho... Ho...

01:46:35.900 --> 01:46:36.960
Wait!

01:46:37.275 --> 01:46:40.298
- Master, there's a problem.
- What?

01:46:40.300 --> 01:46:41.550
I didn't bother to learn this!

01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:46.870
- Can you teach me now?
- It’s too late!

01:47:12.700 --> 01:47:13.760
Fei-Hung!

01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:18.460
She'll appear without a shadow,
just perform the actions.

01:47:20.900 --> 01:47:25.070
Combine the other 7 styles,
and make your own Miss Ho.

01:47:27.050 --> 01:47:29.400
Ho? You want Ho? Sure.

01:47:43.350 --> 01:47:44.920
This is called Widow Seeing Lover off.

01:47:52.350 --> 01:47:54.980
Woman sitting on a toilet Seat.

01:48:02.275 --> 01:48:03.445
You don't sit right!

01:48:11.825 --> 01:48:12.985
Putting on Make-up.

01:48:16.500 --> 01:48:18.390
Pretty girl looks in the mirror.

01:48:19.750 --> 01:48:21.380
These are the famous
Eight Drunken Gods?

01:48:22.625 --> 01:48:25.573
So, you think that you're
the only master here.

01:48:25.575 --> 01:48:29.725
Everyone has different styles even
they learn from the same master.

01:49:59.950 --> 01:50:02.030
