[explosions]

00:20.920 --> 00:21.920
[explosion]

00:22.000 --> 00:23.480
Close the window, Basil.

00:23.560 --> 00:24.960
-There's a war on.
-[window closes]

00:25.040 --> 00:26.320
-Cathedral's been hit.
-[sighs]

00:26.400 --> 00:28.320
Don't think there will be much left.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.600
Used to know someone
who lived up that way.

00:30.680 --> 00:32.720
-Long time ago.
-Woman, was it?

00:32.800 --> 00:34.640
[grunts] Two women, in fact.

00:34.720 --> 00:36.160
Well, that doesn't surprise me.

00:36.240 --> 00:38.000
[explosion, rumbling]

00:39.480 --> 00:41.200
It's the end of everything, you know.

00:41.920 --> 00:43.560
Everything we hold dear.

00:44.160 --> 00:46.240
Democracy itself will fall.

00:47.000 --> 00:48.960
[explosions continue]

00:49.040 --> 00:50.080
[warbles]

00:50.640 --> 00:53.080
Ham and cheese toastie
and a pumpkin latte.

00:55.280 --> 00:56.720
-No?
-[gasps]

00:56.800 --> 00:58.520
Okay. [chuckles]

01:07.000 --> 01:07.840
It's locked.

01:07.920 --> 01:09.880
Well, that door's always been locked.

01:10.680 --> 01:12.080
What is that door?

01:35.920 --> 01:36.760
[warbles]

01:36.840 --> 01:38.640
Ham and cheese toastie
and a pumpkin latte?

01:39.480 --> 01:40.600
Who are you?

01:41.760 --> 01:44.240
-Wrong room. Never mind. [chuckles]
-[warbles]

01:50.840 --> 01:51.840
[zipper opening]

01:56.960 --> 01:59.640
Ham and cheese toastie
and a pumpkin latte? [panting]

02:00.240 --> 02:01.240
Never mind.

02:22.360 --> 02:24.800
Um, do you have a room, please?
Just for the week.

02:25.720 --> 02:28.240
-Single?
-Oh. Does it show? [chuckles]

02:29.160 --> 02:30.360
Room, I mean.

02:30.440 --> 02:31.800
Oh. [chuckles]

02:34.440 --> 02:36.560
Oh. It's quite…

02:37.400 --> 02:38.480
Well, it's um…

02:38.560 --> 02:40.040
[receptionist] Bathroom's through here.

02:40.840 --> 02:42.560
There it is. The en suite.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.240
What's in here?

02:46.880 --> 02:49.800
Oh, it's just that door,
isn't it? [chuckles]

02:49.880 --> 02:52.480
There's always a door like that
in a hotel room. A funny locked one.

02:53.320 --> 02:56.160
-Anyway, I'll go get you some towels.
-[chuckles]

03:00.320 --> 03:02.920
[fly buzzing]

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
Oh.

03:06.240 --> 03:08.320
Hello. Merry Christmas.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.160
I'm Joy. Welcome to my room.

03:13.240 --> 03:15.000
And I thought I was going to be lonely.

03:21.640 --> 03:23.040
[warbles]

03:25.160 --> 03:26.360
Wh-What? [gasps]

03:26.440 --> 03:29.240
[breathing heavily]

03:29.320 --> 03:32.920
The star seed will bloom
and the flesh will rise.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.000
What?

03:35.400 --> 03:37.400
-What is going on?
-[warbles]

03:37.480 --> 03:39.640
Ham and cheese toastie
and a pumpkin latte?

03:41.800 --> 03:46.280
[theme song playing]

04:30.280 --> 04:31.280
[laughs]

04:36.400 --> 04:38.400
[TARDIS warbles]

04:47.800 --> 04:49.960
[yawns]

05:00.200 --> 05:01.200
[sniffs]

05:03.200 --> 05:04.520
[receptionist] Thank you, sir.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.520
[Doctor] Hmm.

05:08.200 --> 05:10.600
[machine beeps, whirring]

05:11.760 --> 05:14.840
[guest] Hello. Is something available
on the third floor?

05:14.920 --> 05:16.160
[receptionist] First visit?

05:16.240 --> 05:17.400
-It is, yes.
-Just a moment.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.000
Uh, sorry, sorry.

05:21.600 --> 05:24.720
Refreshments are for hotel guests only.
Are you a guest at the hotel?

05:24.800 --> 05:26.960
Nah, not me. I bring my own room.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.840
Just need some milk. [sighs]

05:28.920 --> 05:31.120
Got a nav-com algorithm
that homes in on fresh milk.

05:32.720 --> 05:34.720
I mean, I could just get a fridge.

05:34.800 --> 05:37.640
-[stammers] Sorry.
-[chuckles]

05:37.720 --> 05:39.520
-That… Is that a toilet? Or--
-Is it a what?

05:40.280 --> 05:42.520
-You've got a newspaper.
-And a coffee.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.120
Who takes a coffee to the loo?

05:44.200 --> 05:47.520
[stammers] Each to their own.
Is somebody else in there?

05:47.600 --> 05:48.600
N…

05:51.680 --> 05:54.320
Ah, yes. [clicks tongue] Habit.

05:54.400 --> 05:55.720
[inhales deeply]

05:55.800 --> 05:57.760
I never get used to them leaving. Here.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.200
Keep the mug. It's bigger on the inside.

06:13.640 --> 06:15.440
[sighs] Okay.

06:16.080 --> 06:18.520
So I just put my coat on.
Why did I do that?

06:19.440 --> 06:21.240
[the sonic beeps, whirs]

06:21.320 --> 06:23.040
Oh, and now I'm getting the sonic.

06:24.200 --> 06:26.400
What did I see?

06:32.640 --> 06:33.680
Oh, yeah.

06:34.320 --> 06:36.480
Of course. You.

06:37.560 --> 06:39.880
Mysterious Mr You.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.080
Right, no. No.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.640
This box wasn't here a moment ago.
How did it get here?

06:44.320 --> 06:46.120
Special Agent Clint Rock.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.480
I've been sent by the head office.

06:48.560 --> 06:51.840
This goes all the way up to the top.
Look, I've got my own toilet.

06:53.240 --> 06:54.680
-Okay.
-[Doctor] What's your name?

06:54.760 --> 06:55.880
Uh, Trev, sir.

06:58.280 --> 07:00.760
You're working for me now, Trev.
Stroll with me.

07:02.160 --> 07:03.160
Keep it casual,

07:03.240 --> 07:05.000
like you haven't noticed
anything dangerous.

07:06.080 --> 07:08.720
-I haven't noticed anything dangerous.
-Then why aren't you strolling better?

07:08.800 --> 07:11.000
I'm pretending to not notice something
I really haven't noticed.

07:11.080 --> 07:13.040
-Okay. Right.
-I haven't perfected a stroll for that.

07:16.600 --> 07:17.800
That guy…

07:19.200 --> 07:21.600
Mr Suit Guy, what do we think?

07:21.680 --> 07:24.160
-That he's not doing anything.
-And he keeps not doing it.

07:24.760 --> 07:27.720
Again and again and again.

07:27.800 --> 07:30.960
He hasn't looked up once.
And he said it's his first visit.

07:31.040 --> 07:32.280
-So?
-The atrium.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.800
I mean, check out the atrium up there.

07:34.880 --> 07:36.680
Anyone would look up at that
on their first visit.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.160
But we're… we're not looking up.

07:39.080 --> 07:44.160
Because we are on
a top secret dangerous mission.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.120
So what mission is he on

07:49.360 --> 07:52.080
with a briefcase chained to his wrist?

07:53.480 --> 07:55.200
[receptionist] I'm sorry, sir.

07:55.280 --> 07:58.960
We can't make the room available
until the contemporaneous guests vacate.

07:59.040 --> 08:02.240
The bar is open, if you'd care
to have a drink while you're waiting.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.320
Thank you.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.080
Okay. Are we gonna follow him?

08:06.160 --> 08:08.760
Uh, no. I hate following people.
You've got to stay at the back.

08:10.960 --> 08:12.400
The Time Hotel.

08:13.960 --> 08:15.120
What's that then?

08:15.920 --> 08:18.440
Time Hotel. What does that mean?

08:18.520 --> 08:19.600
Ooh, my goodness.

08:21.240 --> 08:24.200
[guests chattering]

08:25.880 --> 08:31.240
All of human history
now available as minibreaks.

08:31.320 --> 08:32.320
Is that how it works?

08:32.400 --> 08:34.800
I thought you were from head office.
Don't you know how it works?

08:34.880 --> 08:39.440
I like to enter investigations
with my mind completely blank.

08:40.160 --> 08:42.480
-I fit in better.
-Should I make my mind blank too, sir?

08:42.560 --> 08:44.400
It may not be necessary
in your case, Trev.

08:44.480 --> 08:45.360
Okay.

08:45.440 --> 08:49.720
So a hotel but instead of rooms,
time portals, yeah?

08:49.800 --> 08:51.640
-Yeah.
-[chuckling] Oh!

08:51.720 --> 08:53.560
-[chuckles]
-Oh!

08:53.640 --> 08:55.720
Uh, that stone door up there,

08:55.800 --> 08:58.720
that is actual stone
live from the Stone Age.

08:59.720 --> 09:02.560
[chuckles, stammers]
Live from a submarine.

09:03.160 --> 09:04.280
Mesopotamia.

09:05.080 --> 09:07.600
-Oh, come on. Got to be Pisa.
-Yeah, Pisa.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.440
[chuckles] "Ancient Rome",

09:09.520 --> 09:11.840
"The Fall of Troy",
"Your Favourite Assassination".

09:11.920 --> 09:16.520
[chuckles] Package deals
for all of history's biggest hits.

09:18.520 --> 09:20.560
No wonder there was no room at the inn.

09:25.560 --> 09:26.720
-Excuse me.
-Hi.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.160
Are there any room service menus
available in the lobby?

09:29.240 --> 09:32.080
-Of course, sir. Just a moment.
-You know what?

09:32.160 --> 09:34.360
This solves the biggest mystery
in the known universe.

09:34.440 --> 09:37.480
Why is there always an extra door
in your hotel room

09:37.560 --> 09:39.400
and why is it always locked?

09:39.480 --> 09:41.680
'Cause that is the way to the Time Hotel.

09:41.760 --> 09:43.120
-Speaking of no room at the inn…
-Uh…

09:43.200 --> 09:44.600
…is this Christmas?

09:44.680 --> 09:46.920
Uh, yes. Yes, we're doing a special.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.240
"Christmas Everywhere All At Once".

09:49.960 --> 09:52.000
There you are.
You just pay on the blue diamond.

09:52.080 --> 09:53.760
Okay, thank you.

09:53.840 --> 09:56.480
Right. What will it be, Trev?

09:57.000 --> 10:00.200
A ham and cheese toastie
and a pumpkin latte, huh?

10:00.280 --> 10:01.160
[the sonic whirring]

10:01.240 --> 10:03.960
Ham and cheese toastie
and a pumpkin latte, sir.

10:04.040 --> 10:05.120
Enjoy your light snack.

10:08.800 --> 10:10.720
The kitchens are 30 minutes in the future.

10:10.800 --> 10:13.640
They start preparing your food
before you order it. It saves time.

10:13.720 --> 10:16.160
-Yeah, it's still microwaved though.
-Well, you can't expect miracles.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.360
Right. I am going undercover.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.160
You are gonna be my point man down here.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.120
Have you got a… a radio or something?

10:22.200 --> 10:24.840
Yeah, it's… it's implanted, sir.

10:24.920 --> 10:27.280
Psychic graft. It's very efficient.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.160
It still calls my mum
if I forget to flush.

10:30.440 --> 10:31.880
My code name is the Doctor.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.680
Just say Doctor
and it will put you through to me.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.720
Tell me the minute
Mr Briefcase leaves the bar.

10:35.800 --> 10:37.800
-Okay.
-I'm gonna check out the time portals.

10:37.880 --> 10:38.760
[stammers] Why?

10:38.840 --> 10:42.280
Because, Trev,
that is where Mr Briefcase wants to go.

10:42.800 --> 10:46.880
Lesson number one, the only meaningful way
to follow someone is to get there first.

10:47.520 --> 10:48.680
Hmm?

10:49.760 --> 10:52.000
There. Look at me. I'm undercover.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.320
Now, I am room service. [laughs]

10:54.400 --> 10:56.960
Oh, right, yeah.
I won't let you down, sir.

10:57.040 --> 10:58.200
I'm sure you won't.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.200
No, seriously. I'm on thi…
[whispers] I'm on this.

11:00.720 --> 11:03.440
This is gonna be the least
I've ever let anybody down.

11:13.720 --> 11:17.040
The star seed will bloom
and the flesh will rise.

11:17.120 --> 11:18.360
Excuse me?

11:20.280 --> 11:22.560
Could you put my case
behind the bar, please?

11:25.000 --> 11:27.040
-[automated voice] Access upgrading.
-[gasps]

11:30.200 --> 11:33.360
[panting]

11:40.040 --> 11:41.280
What do I do now?

11:42.560 --> 11:45.760
Make yourself comfortable
and don't attract attention.

11:45.840 --> 11:48.840
-You should be dead quite shortly.
-[gasps]

11:48.920 --> 11:52.160
The star seed will bloom
and the flesh will rise.

12:04.600 --> 12:06.480
Trev, can you give me a hand in here?

12:07.200 --> 12:08.480
Somebody left this case.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.480
[Trev] What?

12:18.560 --> 12:21.120
-[grunts] Sorry.
-[automated voice] Access upgrading.

12:31.560 --> 12:33.120
This isn't good, is it?

12:33.840 --> 12:34.840
[shakily] Oh, no.

12:37.960 --> 12:39.200
But I was on a mission.

12:48.240 --> 12:49.080
[beeps, buzzes]

12:49.160 --> 12:51.040
[computer voice]
This room is not available.

12:51.120 --> 12:53.640
While guests local to the time period
are still in residence,

12:53.720 --> 12:55.360
the room is not available
to the Time Hotel.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.480
[door beeps]

Ham and cheese toastie
and a pumpkin latte?

[console beeping]

13:15.160 --> 13:18.000
The star seed will bloom
and the flesh will rise.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.160
Sorry, sir.

13:22.240 --> 13:26.560
Can I just check? You have priority access
to all of the time portals, haven't you?

13:26.640 --> 13:28.960
Yes, Trev. I'm the manager.

I went and let him down.

Oh, hello.

14:43.400 --> 14:45.360
Okay, you, yes.

14:45.440 --> 14:47.360
-Good work. Keep him covered.
-[stammers]

14:47.440 --> 14:49.320
-Who are you then?
-I'm Joy.

14:49.400 --> 14:52.520
-Joy. Top name, Joy.
-[stammers] Could somebody…

14:52.600 --> 14:54.080
-Could someone just--
-[screams]

14:55.120 --> 14:56.480
Could someone tell me what is going on?

14:56.560 --> 14:58.960
-Well…
-Why is there a l-lizard man in my room?

14:59.040 --> 15:01.120
I'm so sorry.
This has never happened before.

15:01.200 --> 15:03.040
Question. What is in that case?

15:03.120 --> 15:04.240
Can I see?

15:04.320 --> 15:06.480
Look, I'm just gonna
put these towels in the bathroom.

15:06.560 --> 15:07.600
Take it.

15:07.680 --> 15:09.680
-[automated voice] Access upgrading.
-Then what happens?

15:09.760 --> 15:12.080
Take it and all will be explained.

15:12.160 --> 15:13.400
I do like an explanation.

15:13.480 --> 15:15.360
Um, I'd like an explanation too.

15:15.440 --> 15:17.480
Take it and understand.

15:17.560 --> 15:20.000
Uh, excuse me? Hello.
I would also like to understand.

15:20.080 --> 15:22.440
-And it's my room, so…
-It is actually her room.

15:22.520 --> 15:24.680
Sorry, could you just
leave this with us for a moment?

15:24.760 --> 15:27.400
Oh, am I in the way in my own actual room?

15:27.480 --> 15:28.560
Take the case.

15:28.640 --> 15:30.640
We detect power in you.

15:30.720 --> 15:31.960
Excuse me? Hello.

15:32.040 --> 15:33.480
Well, you've got that right. Who's "we"?

15:33.560 --> 15:34.760
Am I even in this conversation?

15:34.840 --> 15:36.880
Look, sorry, could you just let me
get on with this, please?

15:36.960 --> 15:38.920
Sorry, am I in the way?

15:39.520 --> 15:42.440
Oh, this is just men all over, isn't it?
Even lizard men.

15:42.520 --> 15:43.360
Oh, I know.

15:43.960 --> 15:46.160
He's a Silurian.
Don't call him a lizard man.

15:46.240 --> 15:47.520
Yeah, but it's just a mask, isn't it?

15:47.600 --> 15:48.600
Oh!

15:49.760 --> 15:52.520
Are you two having a sort of game?
I know all about these hotels.

15:52.600 --> 15:55.640
The star seed will bloom
and the flesh will rise.

15:55.720 --> 15:56.640
Don't be filthy.

15:56.720 --> 15:58.080
Okay, funny thing.

15:58.160 --> 16:00.000
I saw someone else with that case
and now you have it.

16:00.080 --> 16:01.440
And that doesn't make any sense.

16:01.520 --> 16:03.800
He was a guest and you're a manager
according to your badge.

16:03.880 --> 16:06.320
Pardon my French,
but what the French is going on?

16:06.400 --> 16:07.880
What happened
to the first guy that had it?

16:07.960 --> 16:09.200
Feeling peaky, is he?

16:09.280 --> 16:11.480
Take the case and you will know.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.760
Got to be honest. I am tempted.

16:14.840 --> 16:16.480
Shut up, the two of you.
I'm taking the case.

16:16.560 --> 16:17.520
-No!

-What's this on my wrist? Look at this.
-[groans]

-Stay very still. Let me see.
-[the sonic whirring]

16:27.080 --> 16:28.560
I've got your towels all sorted.

16:28.640 --> 16:30.360
Phone down to reception
if you want anything else.

16:30.440 --> 16:32.640
-Oh, thank you. You've been very kind.
-Oh.

16:32.720 --> 16:34.880
The star seed will bloom
and the flesh will rise.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.120
Oh, I know. [chuckles]

16:38.920 --> 16:40.920
-[manager groans]
-[door opens]

16:41.800 --> 16:42.800
What do I do now?

16:42.880 --> 16:44.640
-Your motor functions will shut down.
-[door closes]

16:44.720 --> 16:46.280
You'll be dead
in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

16:46.360 --> 16:48.440
Pop yourself on the bed
before you have a nasty fall.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.280
What do you mean dead?
What are you talking about?

16:50.360 --> 16:52.560
Careful, love.
You'll scuff the counterpane.

16:58.040 --> 16:59.680
Listen. Listen to me.

16:59.760 --> 17:02.160
You need to focus. Hold on.

17:02.240 --> 17:04.720
No dying. I'm not having that.

17:04.800 --> 17:06.560
-You're a Silurian.
-[beeping]

17:06.640 --> 17:09.640
The proudest race I know.
The original inhabitants of Earth.

17:10.520 --> 17:15.120
And here you are millions of years later
running the Time Hotel. I mean, wow.

17:16.000 --> 17:17.520
[whispers] How did that happen?

17:17.600 --> 17:20.280
Tell me your story.
Cling on to your story.

17:20.360 --> 17:23.840
[breathing heavily]
I was lost in the caves.

17:24.440 --> 17:25.680
There was a door…

17:26.760 --> 17:27.800
this place.

17:28.320 --> 17:29.480
They were so kind.

17:29.560 --> 17:30.800
[whispering] Oh! Those guys…

17:31.400 --> 17:33.600
Those guys, they helped you.
I love those guys.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.680
Stay alive for those guys.

17:35.760 --> 17:39.320
[chuckling] It was so exciting.

17:50.720 --> 17:52.480
[breathes shakily]

17:52.560 --> 17:56.040
Well, that was a bit sad really,
wasn't it?

18:00.000 --> 18:01.040
Joy.

18:02.880 --> 18:06.240
Joy, what happened to him
will happen to you.

18:06.320 --> 18:08.560
The star seed will bloom
and the flesh will rise.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.000
That's not you speaking.

18:10.760 --> 18:13.960
That is an implanted idea that you think
you are not allowed to question.

18:14.040 --> 18:17.520
You are being mansplained by a briefcase.

18:17.600 --> 18:19.200
Well, I thought
I was being mansplained by you.

18:19.280 --> 18:21.320
Honey, the Doctor's in the room.
It's mansplain central.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.280
Oh, I'm getting that.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.280
-Do you even know what a star seed is?
-Yes. Do you?

18:24.360 --> 18:25.520
Okay, no.

18:26.600 --> 18:27.680
You've got me there.

18:27.760 --> 18:29.840
So let's take a look, shall we?

18:29.920 --> 18:31.520
-[grunts]
-No! Don't do that. Don't open it!

18:31.600 --> 18:33.480
You don't even know
why you are saying that.

18:33.560 --> 18:34.960
So let's find out.

18:37.800 --> 18:41.040
[object pulsating]

18:41.120 --> 18:44.880
Well, what are you then, gorgeous?

18:44.960 --> 18:47.400
[automated voice] Please reseal
the star seed containment unit

18:47.480 --> 18:48.400
within 20 seconds

18:48.480 --> 18:51.760
or the current case holder will be
disintegrated with extreme prejudice.

-Uh, hello, excuse me?
-[shushes] I'm thinking.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.880
-Well, could you close the case and think?
-I'm a very visual person.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.040
It's going to disintegrate me.

19:00.120 --> 19:02.280
-Good. Good. You care about dying again.
-[alarm blaring]

19:02.360 --> 19:05.000
-That means the control has loosened.
-But I'm actually going to die!

Not for several seconds.
Just live in the moment.

-Close it.

19:12.720 --> 19:13.760
-Close the case!
-[alarm intensifies]

19:13.840 --> 19:16.880
-Quiet, please. I don't like being rushed.
-Close it! [gasps]

19:30.160 --> 19:32.240
Whoa. Oh, I didn't see that coming.

19:32.320 --> 19:34.080
-Did you see that coming?
-Do you know the code?

19:34.160 --> 19:35.560
-No. Do you?
-No.

19:35.640 --> 19:38.800
I mean, four digits, that narrows it down
to a possible 10,000 numbers.

19:38.880 --> 19:39.840
-Feeling lucky?
-Really not.

19:39.920 --> 19:42.880
[grunts] I mean,
the variables are never equally weighted.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.360
I could figure out how if I just had…

19:45.440 --> 19:46.920
-What?
-Time.

19:48.240 --> 19:49.480
-The Time Hotel.
-What?

19:49.560 --> 19:52.000
I couldn't use the TARDIS again.
That would re-engage the causal nexus.

19:52.080 --> 19:54.240
But in this hotel, the time zones
are physically connected.

19:54.320 --> 19:56.800
They're already interacting.
So, in theory…

-Him.
-Me.

20:02.920 --> 20:05.280
-[alarm stops]
-Okay. Good. Oh.

20:05.840 --> 20:07.040
It's stabilising. You're safe.

20:07.120 --> 20:08.560
[stammers] How can there be two of you?

20:08.640 --> 20:10.640
There aren't. He's the future.
He's me after I get the code.

20:10.720 --> 20:13.120
I'm not the future. He is the past.
The future is this way.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.560
-Come on.
-No, no. How does this work?

20:14.640 --> 20:16.320
-How do I get to be you?
-The long way around.

20:16.400 --> 20:17.880
-Yes, how long?
-You'll find out.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.160
What do I do? Where do I go?

20:19.240 --> 20:20.160
You will find out.

20:20.240 --> 20:23.480
[groans] Do you see,
this is why nobody likes you.

20:23.560 --> 20:26.920
You have to be mysterious all the time.
That's why everyone leaves you.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.560
-That is why you're always alone.
-You have to stay here.

20:30.160 --> 20:32.120
Complete the loop.
It's the only way to get the code.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.680
I'm gonna break the connection.

20:33.760 --> 20:37.000
-[Joy] But how did you get the code?
-It's a long story. Basically…

20:37.800 --> 20:39.320
Jo… [gasps]

20:40.680 --> 20:43.120
Do you know how alone you are?

20:43.640 --> 20:47.120
You live in a great, big, giant spaceship
and there aren't any chairs.

20:47.200 --> 20:50.480
And you haven't even noticed
because nobody ever comes round.

20:51.080 --> 20:54.040

24:56.320 --> 24:57.520
Hmm?

24:58.640 --> 25:00.720
-Have a chair.
-You what?

25:03.520 --> 25:04.520
Sit down with me.

25:08.360 --> 25:09.360
Have a chair.

25:10.000 --> 25:12.240
-[laughing]
-I'm telling you.

25:12.320 --> 25:14.000
-I'm telling you.
-That makes no sense.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.200
I'm not kidding.

25:15.280 --> 25:18.640
-Can't move if you're looking at them.
-But that's rubbish.

25:18.720 --> 25:21.720
-[Doctor groaning]
-[laughing]

25:25.400 --> 25:26.920
-You know what?
-What?

25:27.000 --> 25:28.440
This is my favourite night of the week.

25:31.040 --> 25:33.040
Yeah. [laughs]

25:34.880 --> 25:36.840
-Chair night.
-Chair night.

25:37.680 --> 25:38.520
[Anita chuckles]

25:39.160 --> 25:41.240
[Doctor] On the yellow.
Put your foot on the yellow.

25:41.320 --> 25:43.680
-[Anita] I can't. I'm all twisted.
-[Doctor] It's called Twister.

25:43.760 --> 25:44.600
[both laugh]

25:44.680 --> 25:46.320
-[Doctor] Miss Scarlett?
-[Anita] Yeah.

25:46.400 --> 25:48.440
-In the kitchen with the lead piping.
-[Doctor laughs]

25:50.760 --> 25:51.760
Your go.

25:56.760 --> 25:58.520
Anita, this door…

25:59.360 --> 26:01.400
do any other rooms here
have doors like this?

26:01.480 --> 26:02.960
They're mostly cupboards.

26:04.040 --> 26:06.720
Well, except in the honeymoon suite.

26:07.520 --> 26:09.160
Show me right now.

26:09.240 --> 26:10.280
[the sonic whirring]

26:10.360 --> 26:13.280
You see, the connection
to the Time Hotel isn't active.

26:13.360 --> 26:14.440
I can't get through.

26:15.040 --> 26:16.600
Not a clue what he's talking about.

26:18.440 --> 26:20.840
-You guys?
-[Doctor] I guess I just have to wait.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.440
I hate waiting. Don't you?

26:24.520 --> 26:25.600
[both] Yes.

26:26.120 --> 26:27.440
[music playing on radio]

26:27.520 --> 26:28.720
What are you waiting for?

26:29.400 --> 26:31.840
-Sorry, what?
-You always say you're waiting.

26:31.920 --> 26:33.680
-What for?
-Nothing.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.480
[chuckles] Nothing.

26:36.560 --> 26:38.800
[birds chirping]

26:49.320 --> 26:51.600
I don't like it when the clocks go back.
Do you?

26:53.520 --> 26:54.360
No.

26:59.040 --> 27:00.720
Oh, he would've loved this, you know.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.320
-Who?
-Guy.

27:02.400 --> 27:04.560
-Who's Guy?
-Guy Fawkes.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.400
-The guy who tried to blow up parliament…
-Oh. [laughs]

27:07.480 --> 27:09.080
…you know, the fireworks are for him.

27:09.160 --> 27:11.320
-[chuckles]
-[chuckles] He's not your boyfriend then?

27:12.120 --> 27:13.320
I don't have a boyfriend.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.800
[scoffs] Yeah, boyfriends.
Who needs them, right?

27:15.880 --> 27:16.720
Right.

27:16.800 --> 27:17.800
[Anita chuckles]

27:18.800 --> 27:20.000
["Silent Night" playing]

27:33.360 --> 27:35.800
[music fades]

27:42.040 --> 27:44.240
So you're not going to be here
for Christmas then?

27:44.920 --> 27:46.480
Sneaking off without saying goodbye?

27:46.560 --> 27:49.080
Just, uh… Just off for a few days.

27:49.160 --> 27:50.480
I've heard that one before.

27:50.560 --> 27:52.160
[laughs]

27:52.240 --> 27:56.840
Anita… [stammers] I-I…

27:56.920 --> 28:00.200
[stammers] …have a slightly
complicated life.

28:00.280 --> 28:02.160
[gasps] Oh, God.
You're married, aren't you?

28:02.240 --> 28:04.480
-No. No. It's not that. [laughs]
-Ah, oh. [chuckles]

28:04.560 --> 28:09.200
[stammers] It's just, uh,
I don't usually live like this.

28:10.000 --> 28:12.480
One day after the other…
[stammers] …in the right order.

28:13.520 --> 28:16.320
And I always wondered
what it would be like.

28:18.800 --> 28:20.240
And do you know what it was like?

28:21.720 --> 28:22.560
Amazing.

28:22.640 --> 28:23.920
[Anita sighs]

28:24.000 --> 28:26.960
[chuckles] And you know why
it was amazing?

28:28.640 --> 28:30.560
-You.
-Ah, don't.

28:30.640 --> 28:34.120
-[chuckles] Don't--
-A whole year of you.

28:35.800 --> 28:36.800
Wow.

28:39.720 --> 28:43.440
Everyone who knows you is so lucky.

28:45.240 --> 28:47.800
I bet you they tell you that all the time.

28:49.640 --> 28:51.520
[clicks tongue] Just the once actually.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.840
Just the one guy. [chuckles]

28:56.560 --> 28:57.960
But I have things to do.

28:59.040 --> 29:00.480
Promises to keep.

29:00.560 --> 29:01.840
I always knew you were going.

29:02.800 --> 29:05.120
-I always knew that. I did.
-I know.

29:05.200 --> 29:07.600
-You look after yourself, okay?
-[groans]

29:09.840 --> 29:12.240
[inhales sharply]
Never be alone at Christmas.

29:12.320 --> 29:14.560
You don't need to be
'cause I'll be right here.

29:15.840 --> 29:18.680
Anita at the Sandringham.

29:21.880 --> 29:23.560
[shakily] Think of me sometimes.

29:25.240 --> 29:26.760
For auld lang syne.

29:28.840 --> 29:30.080
For auld lang syne.

29:56.560 --> 29:58.320
[warbling]

30:01.360 --> 30:02.760
[whirring]

30:11.440 --> 30:14.160
-[past Doctor] Come in!
-Seven, two, one, four.

30:14.240 --> 30:15.760
-Seven, two, one, four.
-Who are you?

30:15.840 --> 30:16.840
-Him.
-Me.

30:16.920 --> 30:18.840
-[alarm stops]
-Okay. Good. Oh.

30:19.440 --> 30:21.640
-It's stabilising. You're safe.
-How can there be two of you?

30:21.720 --> 30:23.880
There aren't. He's the future.
He's me after I get the code.

30:23.960 --> 30:26.240
I'm not the future. He is the past.
The future is this way.

30:26.320 --> 30:27.840
-Come on.
-No, no. How does this work?

30:27.920 --> 30:29.240
-How do I get to be you?
-The long way around.

30:29.320 --> 30:30.680
-[past Doctor] Yes, how long?
-You'll find out.

30:30.760 --> 30:32.280
-What do I do? Where do I go?
-[gasps]

30:32.360 --> 30:33.280
You will find out.

30:33.360 --> 30:36.360
[past Doctor groans] Do you see,
this is why nobody likes you.

30:36.440 --> 30:39.200
You have to be mysterious all the time.
That's why everyone leaves you,

30:39.280 --> 30:42.080
-why you are always alone.
-You have to stay here.

30:42.800 --> 30:45.320
Complete the loop.
It's the only way to get the code.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.680
I'm gonna break the connection.

30:46.760 --> 30:49.080
-But how did you get the code?
-It's a long story.

30:53.080 --> 30:54.320
But basically…

30:56.600 --> 30:58.280
[past Doctor]
Do you know how alone you are?

30:58.360 --> 31:00.600
…I heard myself say it a year ago,
and I remembered it.

31:00.680 --> 31:02.200
-I don't… I can't--
-[Doctor] Bootstrapping,

31:02.280 --> 31:03.360
it's weird, I know.

31:03.440 --> 31:05.440
I mean, basically,
the code came from nowhere.

31:05.520 --> 31:08.040
But then so did the universe
and no one complains about that.

31:08.120 --> 31:10.800
Uh… but… [stutters]
…you never got the code.

31:10.880 --> 31:12.360
[stutters] When did you get the code?

31:12.440 --> 31:14.280
What, you just time-travelled
and told yourself?

31:14.360 --> 31:16.360
No time travel involved.
That would cause a paradox.

31:16.440 --> 31:18.880
In this hotel, the time zones
are already physically linked.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.160
They're paradox-proof.

31:21.240 --> 31:23.440
-Just breaking the connection.
-[door buzzes]

31:23.520 --> 31:25.800
When you explain things,
do people feel any better?

31:25.880 --> 31:27.920
-Not usually, no.
-Mmm.

31:30.680 --> 31:34.040
Take care, you. Be kind. You'll miss her.

31:34.120 --> 31:35.280
The star seed.

31:36.400 --> 31:38.280
Yes. Yes, the star seed.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.080
Oh, I have had a long time
to think about it.

31:40.160 --> 31:43.040
Several seconds, in fact,
and I'm pretty sure I've figured it out.

31:43.120 --> 31:45.720
I even know why they need the Time Hotel.

31:45.800 --> 31:48.040
The star seed will bloom
and the flesh will rise.

31:49.920 --> 31:53.520
I resealed that case,
now it is reasserting control.

31:53.600 --> 31:55.480
Joy. You need to fight it, Joy.

31:56.120 --> 31:57.280
[sighs]

31:59.840 --> 32:01.920
The assassination of Julius Caesar.

32:03.880 --> 32:04.880
Well, that won't do, will it?

32:04.960 --> 32:06.960
So you're scouting
for the right time zone.

32:07.680 --> 32:09.640
My room wasn't far enough back in time.

32:10.560 --> 32:12.000
Neither is this.

32:12.080 --> 32:14.320
-I think we'll need the top floor.
-For what?

32:14.840 --> 32:17.080
Do you even understand
what you're trying to accomplish?

32:17.160 --> 32:18.240
Yes.

32:18.320 --> 32:20.520
Okay. Okay. Here's what I worked out.

32:20.600 --> 32:23.480
Inside that case, inside some sort of
quantum-sealed container,

32:23.560 --> 32:24.440
is a single atom,

32:24.520 --> 32:26.920
and in that atom,
a chain reaction has already begun.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.560
Do you know what that chain reaction
will lead to?

32:29.640 --> 32:30.760
The star seed will bloom.

32:30.840 --> 32:32.360
A star will be born, yes.

32:32.440 --> 32:34.760
Big burny bang. In theory.

32:34.840 --> 32:38.000
But no one's ever been able to test that
theory because it would take too long.

32:38.080 --> 32:40.600
Thousands of years,
maybe more, no one knows.

32:40.680 --> 32:41.920
You do like to talk, don't you?

32:42.000 --> 32:44.760
So if you were some big old
corporation in a big old hurry,

32:44.840 --> 32:46.360
and you wanted a custom-built,

32:46.440 --> 32:49.160
made-to-measure star
for your own personal energy source,

32:49.240 --> 32:51.120
you would need one thing, yeah.

32:52.600 --> 32:56.080
Time. And here we are. In the Time Hotel.

32:56.680 --> 32:59.160
Pop your case in one time zone,
walk along the corridor

32:59.240 --> 33:01.520
to another time zone
thousands of years later,

33:01.600 --> 33:03.600
-ding, ding, ding…
-[elevator door dings]

33:04.480 --> 33:06.040
…you just microwaved a star.

33:06.920 --> 33:07.760
[sighs]

33:11.000 --> 33:11.880
[sighs]

33:11.960 --> 33:13.160
-Going up.
-[doors close]

33:13.240 --> 33:15.760
Oh, do you know
what else I worked out, Joy?

33:17.200 --> 33:18.160
You.

33:18.240 --> 33:22.600
[laughs] Ah, I just spent a year
in a hotel room that you chose.

33:23.360 --> 33:25.040
Do you know what you can tell
about a person

33:25.120 --> 33:27.680
-from the hotel room that they choose?
-Nothing.

33:28.280 --> 33:29.280
Everything.

33:31.160 --> 33:32.160
Everything.

33:34.240 --> 33:37.880
So you see, a house, that's a…
that's a disguise.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.920
It's a fortress.
You can… You can hide yourself away

33:41.000 --> 33:45.600
with… with pictures and flowers
and tables. But…

33:50.200 --> 33:51.280
A hotel room?

33:52.640 --> 33:54.200
That's you without make-up.

33:54.960 --> 33:56.760
It's what you think you need.

33:58.480 --> 34:00.320
It's what you're willing to accept.

34:02.800 --> 34:08.560
Not a selfie that you posed for,
more like catching yourself in the mirror.

34:09.160 --> 34:11.080
What's your mirror telling you, Joy?

34:13.240 --> 34:18.320
Because your room
was the worst, loneliest,

34:19.080 --> 34:22.240
saddest hotel room in the world.

34:23.840 --> 34:27.000
What kind of person,
what kind of sad sack,

34:27.080 --> 34:32.680
human train wreck puts themself
in a room like that at Christmas?

34:33.280 --> 34:34.920
[breathes shakily]

34:35.000 --> 34:36.920
-[elevator dings]
-[doors open]

34:38.520 --> 34:40.200
Question for you. Seriously.

34:40.280 --> 34:42.840
When you tell people your name,
do they laugh?

34:44.600 --> 34:45.440
Excuse me?

34:45.520 --> 34:48.320
When you come in,
all smiles and apologies,

34:48.400 --> 34:51.680
and don't-mind-mes, and you say "I'm Joy,"

34:52.200 --> 34:54.120
does everybody burst out laughing?

34:54.200 --> 34:58.320
When your mother looked into
your squishy little baby face

34:58.400 --> 35:00.200
and named you Joy,
was it a joke, do you think?

35:00.280 --> 35:01.720
Was she having a laugh?

35:03.200 --> 35:04.600
Don't you dare talk about my mother.

35:04.680 --> 35:06.880
I would love to meet her.
She sounds like a riot.

35:06.960 --> 35:08.440
-She's dead!
-[clicks tongue]

35:08.520 --> 35:09.800
She died in hospital.

35:09.880 --> 35:12.560
I couldn't even visit.
I had to talk to her on an iPad!

35:12.640 --> 35:14.440
-Because of the rules.
-Oh, the rules.

35:14.520 --> 35:15.400
Yes, the rules.

35:15.480 --> 35:17.240
[Doctor] I bet you're good at
obeying those rules.

35:17.320 --> 35:21.040
Funny, smiley,
I'll-be-no-trouble little you.

35:22.480 --> 35:23.320
Don't you say that.

35:24.280 --> 35:25.680
Don't you say that!

35:26.280 --> 35:28.280
-[birds chirping]
-[monkeys chattering]

35:30.080 --> 35:31.400
[breathes shakily]

35:31.480 --> 35:33.880
Never mind poor old Mum, right?

35:34.480 --> 35:37.080
As long as her good little girl
is obeying all the rules.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.200
[chain clatters]

35:39.280 --> 35:40.840
She died on Christmas Day.

35:40.920 --> 35:42.160
On Christmas Day!

35:42.240 --> 35:45.400
And I said goodbye on an iPad!
Because of the rules.

35:45.480 --> 35:46.520
She died alone.

35:47.320 --> 35:49.240
And those awful people,
and their wine fridges,

35:49.320 --> 35:51.800
and their dancing and their parties
and I listened to them

35:51.880 --> 35:53.760
and I let my mother die alone!

35:53.840 --> 35:56.120
[whimpering] I can never be home
on Christmas Day,

35:56.200 --> 35:58.320
and I can never be
with anyone on Christmas Day

35:58.400 --> 35:59.600
because I let her down.

36:01.200 --> 36:04.200
I let her down
on the last day of her life,

36:04.280 --> 36:05.480
on Christmas Day.

36:07.400 --> 36:10.720
I can't ever change that.
I can't ever change it.

36:11.320 --> 36:14.320
[crying]

36:19.160 --> 36:20.000
Mums, eh?

36:20.080 --> 36:22.560
[breathes shakily]

36:24.120 --> 36:26.160
Even when they're gone,
they never stop saving us.

36:29.680 --> 36:31.400
Look, Joy.

36:34.080 --> 36:35.640
Look what's not in your hand.

36:39.680 --> 36:40.800
Why did you do that?

36:40.880 --> 36:42.400
I'm sorry, yeah?

36:43.320 --> 36:46.360
Made you angry to wake you up.

36:48.880 --> 36:51.400
It's kind of like
post-hypnotic suggestion.

36:51.480 --> 36:55.320
You can break it down with strong emotion.

36:57.400 --> 36:58.400
[the sonic whirring]

36:58.480 --> 37:00.960
-Had to be anger, did it?
-With you, definitely.

37:01.040 --> 37:01.920
[whirring stops]

37:02.000 --> 37:05.040
All that rage, bubbling away,
just below the surface.

37:05.120 --> 37:06.840
Have you seen your smile?

37:06.920 --> 37:08.840
Like the lid on a boiling pot.

37:10.920 --> 37:11.920
Thank you.

37:18.200 --> 37:21.520
You're thinking that maybe
that wasn't a good way to save your life.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.720
Let me tell you something.
There's no such thing as a bad way.

37:26.800 --> 37:28.920
I'm sorry, Joy.

37:35.080 --> 37:36.160
It was beautiful.

37:38.280 --> 37:39.480
I was a star.

37:40.120 --> 37:42.160
That's the conditioning talking.

37:43.120 --> 37:44.400
It will pass.

37:48.960 --> 37:50.760
I am not the bad guy here, Joy.

37:52.760 --> 37:54.160
Let's meet the bad guys.

37:58.040 --> 38:01.320
Wherever there's a corporation,
there is PR.

38:02.000 --> 38:05.800
They just can't stop themselves.
Evil must logo.

38:11.160 --> 38:12.480
Conflict solutions?

38:13.040 --> 38:15.720
Villengard. [laughs]

38:15.800 --> 38:19.720
Ah, biggest arms manufacturer
in recorded history.

38:19.800 --> 38:22.320
-Very old enemies of mine.
-But… [stammers, sighs]

38:22.400 --> 38:24.400
…why would a weapons manufacturer
want to make a star?

38:24.480 --> 38:26.200
[automated voice]
Villengard Q & A activated.

38:26.840 --> 38:30.560
Villengard is engaged in the creation of
a customisable energy source,

38:30.640 --> 38:32.240
which is functionally infinite.

38:32.320 --> 38:33.840
And definitionally insane.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.480
Doctor, that voice, I know that voice.

38:37.080 --> 38:37.960
Hello, again.

38:38.040 --> 38:41.160
My consciousness has been uploaded
to the communication interface

38:41.240 --> 38:42.320
for user convenience.

38:42.400 --> 38:47.080
If a star seed goes boom
anywhere on Earth,

38:47.160 --> 38:51.520
at any point in history,
it will burn every living thing.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.600
Tell that to your users.

38:53.680 --> 38:56.120
Villengard respects
the collateral sacrifice

38:56.200 --> 38:58.280
made by all participating
innocent life forms…

38:58.360 --> 39:00.240
-[creature growling]
-…regardless of race, species,

39:00.320 --> 39:02.000
-or belief system.
-The thing is,

39:02.080 --> 39:03.800
you've got your sums all wrong.

39:03.880 --> 39:06.160
I've been scanning your star seed,
and you don't have enough time.

39:06.240 --> 39:08.400
-Nowhere near enough time to grow a star.
-[thudding]

39:08.480 --> 39:09.760
Doctor.

39:09.840 --> 39:11.720
I mean, clever idea, the Time Hotel.

39:11.800 --> 39:14.360
But human history's only
a few thousand years long,

39:14.440 --> 39:15.880
you're gonna need a lot longer than that.

39:15.960 --> 39:17.760
Like way longer.

39:17.840 --> 39:18.960
According to my calculations…

39:19.040 --> 39:19.880
[Joy] Doctor.

39:19.960 --> 39:24.760
…you would need to check into
the Time Hotel 65 million years ago.

39:25.360 --> 39:26.760
-[Joy screams]
-[grunting]

39:27.760 --> 39:29.000
-[grunting]
-[exclaims]

39:29.080 --> 39:31.080
[roaring]

39:43.560 --> 39:44.760
[swallows]

39:46.440 --> 39:47.840
Oh, French.

39:48.640 --> 39:50.080
[dinosaur growls]

39:50.160 --> 39:51.920
[Joy whimpering]

39:53.640 --> 39:56.560
-[both screaming]
-[roars]

39:59.880 --> 40:01.080
[Doctor pants]

40:02.280 --> 40:03.760
[roaring]

40:03.840 --> 40:04.960
[Doctor grunting]

40:05.040 --> 40:07.480
-[jazz music playing on gramophone]
-Go, go, go, go.

40:08.240 --> 40:09.080
[pants]

40:10.160 --> 40:12.320
-[roars]
-[gasps]

40:13.200 --> 40:15.280
[Joy screams, exclaims]

40:15.360 --> 40:17.440
-[gasps] You okay?
-[whimpers] Yeah.

40:17.520 --> 40:18.360
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

40:18.440 --> 40:20.440
-Okay. Okay.
-[panting]

40:21.080 --> 40:23.560
Many things about this are suboptimal.

40:23.640 --> 40:25.520
Uh. So… So… [stammers] …dinosaurs.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.520
They were about, uh,
65 million years ago, yeah?

40:27.600 --> 40:31.200
Fine, bring that up, why don't you?
That speech was going really well!

40:31.920 --> 40:34.160
[stuttering] So that means about now,
about my time

40:34.960 --> 40:36.320
the whole world is going to burn.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.360
But that wouldn't be part of the plan.

40:38.440 --> 40:43.360
Villengard would have to pick up
the case again just before detonation.

40:43.440 --> 40:44.800
How would they find it?

40:44.880 --> 40:48.040
They would have to send a signal.

40:48.840 --> 40:50.800
-Okay, where to?
-To you.

40:51.720 --> 40:52.920
To the last case carrier,

40:53.000 --> 40:55.000
they would send
a telepathic message to you.

40:55.080 --> 40:56.880
[sighs] But… [stammers]
…I'm not getting a message.

40:56.960 --> 40:58.600
Because the link got severed.

40:58.680 --> 41:00.280
I forced a break.
I damaged the connection.

41:00.360 --> 41:02.760
I screwed up, Joy. I screwed up.

41:02.840 --> 41:04.960
-[breathes deeply]
-[the sonic beeps, whirs]

41:05.040 --> 41:06.680
[stutters] What's that buzzing noise?

41:07.400 --> 41:09.680
Uh… Uh, Doctor,
your-your thing is buzzing.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.960
Listen, all of me is pretty stressed.

41:12.040 --> 41:13.880
No, your… [stammers] …zappy thing.

41:13.960 --> 41:17.240
This… This is a sonic screwdriver.
Actually, zappy thing makes more sense.

41:17.320 --> 41:18.400
Oh.

41:18.480 --> 41:20.400
-[the sonic beeps]
-[yelps, exclaims]

41:20.480 --> 41:22.840
Hello, sir,
Trev Simpkins reporting for duty.

41:24.360 --> 41:25.640
Trev?

41:25.720 --> 41:26.920
Hello again, sir.

41:27.000 --> 41:28.560
I hope it's all going well.

41:28.640 --> 41:31.280
My mission is
proceeding broadly as planned,

41:31.800 --> 41:34.000
and I have exceeded
my personal expectations,

41:34.080 --> 41:36.520
which is giving me
considerable satisfaction

41:36.600 --> 41:38.240
and renewed hope for the future.

41:38.320 --> 41:39.360
However, I'm dead.

41:40.720 --> 41:43.680
You're what?
Sorry… [stammers] …you're what?

41:43.760 --> 41:44.920
I'm part of the star now, sir.

41:45.520 --> 41:49.040
My consciousness has been uploaded
to the Villengard communication interface.

41:49.120 --> 41:50.920
-You're inside the star?
-Yes, sir.

41:51.000 --> 41:54.000
Inside the star, inside the briefcase,
inside the dinosaur?

41:54.080 --> 41:56.400
Well, the afterlife has not been
without incident, sir.

41:56.480 --> 41:58.040
How are you even talking to me?

41:58.120 --> 42:00.240
The psychic graft
has been duplicated virtually.

42:00.320 --> 42:03.080
I was able to connect it to
the briefcase communication software.

42:03.160 --> 42:04.200
That was very clever.

42:04.280 --> 42:06.880
Well, I've had several million years
to work it out.

42:06.960 --> 42:07.960
-[chuckles]
-Sir,

42:08.040 --> 42:10.000
-the star seed is about to detonate.
-[gasps]

42:10.080 --> 42:11.240
We have to get it off-world.

42:11.960 --> 42:14.520
Why would you be helping me?
You're part of Villengard now.

42:14.600 --> 42:18.520
As I told you a very long time ago,
I will not let you down, sir.

42:18.600 --> 42:19.680
-Trev, I love you.
-[chuckles]

42:19.760 --> 42:21.160
-Oh.
-I actually…

42:21.240 --> 42:24.560
-[chuckles]
-…really, physically love you, Trev.

42:24.640 --> 42:25.680
Thanks.

42:25.760 --> 42:28.560
But I need you to tell me exactly
when and where you are.

42:28.640 --> 42:31.440
I know that you're stuck inside there,
but the case will have sensors.

42:31.520 --> 42:34.920
Can you access air density,
humidity, temperature,

42:35.000 --> 42:37.640
rotational mavity,
anything I can use to narrow it down?

42:37.720 --> 42:39.200
I'll run those numbers straight away, sir.

42:39.280 --> 42:41.280
-Oh.
-Great, brilliant, Trev--

42:41.360 --> 42:43.320
Oh, uh, but in the meantime, if it helps,

42:43.400 --> 42:44.680
we're in Room 48.

42:44.760 --> 42:45.600
-Yes, yes.
-[gasps]

42:45.680 --> 42:47.600
That helps quite a lot, Trev. Thank you!

42:51.440 --> 42:54.440
Okay. Okay,
I think we've located you, Trev.

42:54.520 --> 42:55.720
Stand by, I am on the case.

42:55.800 --> 42:56.960
Standing by, sir.

42:57.040 --> 42:59.720
Oh. Then the case is inside that?
How did it get there?

42:59.800 --> 43:03.600
Well, eventually, the dinosaur
would have thrown it up or deposited it.

43:03.680 --> 43:06.240
Either way, it would've lain around
for millions of years,

43:06.320 --> 43:08.040
hijacking any living thing
that passed it by.

43:08.120 --> 43:12.200
This structure is man-made,
so we're a long time later.

43:12.280 --> 43:13.440
But it's a shrine.

43:13.520 --> 43:16.720
Uh-huh. The case emits a psychic field.
It possesses people.

43:16.800 --> 43:18.480
It's basically how you start a religion.

43:20.160 --> 43:21.400
It's getting warm.

43:23.000 --> 43:25.200
Trev, how long till star detonation?

43:25.280 --> 43:26.440
Four-and-a-half millennia, sir.

43:26.520 --> 43:28.200
Do you wanna
run those numbers again, Trev?

43:28.280 --> 43:31.000
Uh… four-and-a-half minutes, sir.

43:31.920 --> 43:33.640
-Oh, great!
-What?

43:33.720 --> 43:35.600
Bags of time. Thanks for that, Trev.

43:35.680 --> 43:37.200
-[stammers] What are you gonna do?
-[grunts]

43:37.280 --> 43:38.880
What's the plan?
How do you stop a star blooming?

43:38.960 --> 43:41.320
-Throw it into space using a phone box.
-A what?

43:41.400 --> 43:42.240
-Rope.
-Rope?

43:42.320 --> 43:44.840
Rope! Oh, I need rope.
I saw rope. Where did I see rope?

43:44.920 --> 43:48.080
[groans] Just wait! Just wait right there.

43:48.160 --> 43:50.800
I am very, very good with rope. [chuckles]

43:52.240 --> 43:55.240
[murmuring]

43:55.320 --> 43:57.520
This is the most technical climb.

43:59.440 --> 44:00.960
Now if the weather holds…

44:01.640 --> 44:03.520
You! What are you doing?

44:04.360 --> 44:07.360
What the devil are you doing?
Why are you taking that equipment?

44:08.320 --> 44:10.680
Because it was there. [sighs]

44:13.800 --> 44:15.840
-[warbling]
-Sorry!

44:15.920 --> 44:18.080
Hello again. Coming through.

[star seed pulsating]

45:38.440 --> 45:39.440
It's okay.

45:40.920 --> 45:41.920
Don't worry.

45:43.440 --> 45:44.680
You're going to be fine.

45:46.760 --> 45:47.840
We can do this.

45:49.400 --> 45:50.240
You and I.

45:52.160 --> 45:53.160
I want you to live.

45:55.640 --> 45:57.360
[grunting]

46:06.000 --> 46:09.240
You are better off without him.
His sentence structure is appalling.

46:09.320 --> 46:10.880
I wrote this letter.

46:11.560 --> 46:13.720
Great letter. You should send it to him.

46:13.800 --> 46:15.840
-To her.
-Glad I could help.

46:21.280 --> 46:23.160
Trev. Trev, how long have we got?

46:23.240 --> 46:24.440
-Sorry, sorry.
-[guests exclaiming]

46:24.520 --> 46:26.920
-[Trev] Sorry. It's about to detonate.
-[grunting, panting]

46:31.520 --> 46:32.600
Joy!

46:33.640 --> 46:35.680
[grunts, panting]

46:40.120 --> 46:41.360
Joy!

46:44.560 --> 46:45.920
[panting]

47:04.160 --> 47:05.200
Joy.

47:05.280 --> 47:06.520
[light pulsating]

47:11.800 --> 47:13.680
I was hoping you'd come back
to say goodbye.

47:15.280 --> 47:16.400
You're very lovely, you know?

47:17.080 --> 47:18.080
Joy.

47:19.480 --> 47:20.760
Joy, the star seed--

47:20.840 --> 47:21.840
Is in me now.

47:23.040 --> 47:24.040
It's in all of us.

47:27.960 --> 47:29.160
Mission complete, sir.

47:31.880 --> 47:32.880
[gasps]

47:33.400 --> 47:34.520
The star seed will bloom.

47:35.800 --> 47:38.720
But don't worry,
we'll be far from here, deep in the sky.

47:40.200 --> 47:41.080
No one will be hurt.

47:41.160 --> 47:43.400
-[panting]
-You know what?

47:44.640 --> 47:46.040
I think I'm saving the world.

47:46.120 --> 47:48.240
Joy, I am supposed to be saving you.

47:49.080 --> 47:51.840
I will not allow Villengard
to do this to you, not to any of you!

47:51.920 --> 47:54.280
Villengard are nothing.

47:55.240 --> 47:56.400
We're far beyond them now.

47:56.480 --> 47:58.640
Listen, you don't understand.

47:58.720 --> 48:02.080
Joy, you will burn. You will die.

48:02.160 --> 48:03.160
Don't be silly.

48:04.160 --> 48:05.240
Of course I won't.

48:06.560 --> 48:07.680
I'm not dying.

48:08.640 --> 48:09.640
I'm changing.

48:10.720 --> 48:12.760
I'm saving something beautiful.

48:13.520 --> 48:17.000
The flesh will rise
and the star will shine.

48:17.680 --> 48:18.680
I will shine.

48:19.920 --> 48:21.400
Everywhere and forever.

48:21.960 --> 48:22.880
[breathes shakily]

48:22.960 --> 48:27.360
And sometimes,
my funny little Doctor, on you.

48:29.200 --> 48:30.440
Because you need to change too.

48:31.880 --> 48:32.880
Excuse me?

48:34.280 --> 48:35.280
My hotel room.

48:36.120 --> 48:37.520
All those things you said about me.

48:37.600 --> 48:38.600
Joy, I…

48:39.160 --> 48:41.480
I just had to make you angry, I told you.

48:41.560 --> 48:42.960
Everything you said was true.

48:44.440 --> 48:49.520
All of it. But, Doctor… [sighs]
…you stayed in that room for a year.

48:50.680 --> 48:51.680
[chuckles]

48:54.960 --> 48:56.160
It wasn't so bad.

48:58.000 --> 48:59.080
Nice chairs.

48:59.160 --> 49:00.160
[chuckles]

49:02.960 --> 49:04.080
You need to find a friend.

49:05.280 --> 49:06.280
Do that.

49:07.600 --> 49:09.120
Go and find one, now.

49:10.240 --> 49:11.240
I'll be watching.

49:12.160 --> 49:13.000
[chuckles]

49:24.160 --> 49:25.520
[chuckles]

49:25.600 --> 49:27.960
You see, Doctor? You see?

49:28.720 --> 49:30.120
My mum was right, wasn't she?

49:33.080 --> 49:34.480
She was right all along.

49:35.560 --> 49:36.560
I'm Joy!

49:37.080 --> 49:40.040
And I'm gonna see her again.
And she's gonna be with me.

49:40.640 --> 49:41.720
[chuckles]

49:41.800 --> 49:42.800
[chuckles]

49:46.480 --> 49:47.480
[gasps]

49:59.880 --> 50:03.480
-[chuckling]
-[all clear siren blaring]

50:04.880 --> 50:06.320
There's hope, you know.

50:07.320 --> 50:09.120
We've got to cling on to that.

50:10.240 --> 50:12.240
There's still hope.

50:33.240 --> 50:34.880
I think the weather will hold, my friend.

50:35.920 --> 50:37.000
Of course it will.

50:38.000 --> 50:39.280
It's in the stars.

50:51.080 --> 50:52.480
[chuckles]

50:52.560 --> 50:53.840
[phone buzzing]

51:02.760 --> 51:03.760
Hi, Mum.

51:28.120 --> 51:29.920
-[door opens]
-[warbling]

51:32.000 --> 51:33.680
You come highly recommended.

51:35.600 --> 51:38.720
By an old friend of yours, I believe.

51:41.000 --> 51:43.520
Would you be interested in working
at the Time Hotel?

51:58.000 --> 51:59.440
[Joy] Mum, I'll see you soon.

52:00.600 --> 52:02.600
-I'll see you very soon.
-[heart monitor beeping]

52:02.680 --> 52:05.440
As soon as this nonsense is over.
I'll be right in there.

52:07.440 --> 52:08.840
You be brave.

52:08.920 --> 52:10.120
[gasps]

52:12.120 --> 52:13.120
Merry Christmas.

52:14.880 --> 52:16.520
And I can't wait to see you properly.

52:23.240 --> 52:24.240
Bye.

52:26.400 --> 52:28.040
[breathes shakily]

52:40.280 --> 52:42.280
[breathes shakily]

52:46.240 --> 52:47.240
[cries]

52:48.160 --> 52:49.160
[shakily] Joy.

53:09.880 --> 53:11.280
Oh, of course.

53:12.920 --> 53:13.920
Joy.

53:15.000 --> 53:16.960
Of course you are. You are Joy.

53:18.240 --> 53:20.040
[chuckles]

53:28.440 --> 53:30.240
Joy to the world!

53:49.640 --> 53:51.640
[theme song playing]

53:54.720 --> 53:56.960
[song continues]
