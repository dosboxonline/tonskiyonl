44:30.038 --> 44:33.198

to grab a drink or something?

44:35.078 --> 44:36.878
Sure, yeah.

44:36.878 --> 44:38.918

45:00.318 --> 45:02.398
How you doing?
Good.

45:02.398 --> 45:04.638
You going to the airport?
It's kinda late.

45:04.638 --> 45:07.358
There's a problem with
my Airbnb so... Oh!

45:07.358 --> 45:09.638
I've just got to check
- into a hotel later.

45:09.638 --> 45:11.678
Right, what can I get you?

45:12.958 --> 45:15.598
Well, er, let me have a look.

45:18.198 --> 45:20.718

Beer? Let's get you a beer.

45:30.118 --> 45:32.678
Excuse me?
You know what, er, actually,

45:32.678 --> 45:34.918
let me, let me try one of those.
Old Fashioned?

45:34.918 --> 45:37.598
- Yes. Whatever that is.
- Can I get
another one of those, please.

45:37.598 --> 45:40.438
Of course.
Looks very, uh, sophisticated.

45:45.438 --> 45:47.638
How long are you in Tallinn?

45:47.638 --> 45:50.198
Er, just a couple of nights.
Yeah, work.

45:50.198 --> 45:52.238
I'm an architectural engineer.

45:53.438 --> 45:57.758
OK. OK, you weren't at the
Kontserdisaal for the gig, right?

45:57.758 --> 45:59.998
That obvious?
Very obvious.

46:01.278 --> 46:03.318
(BOTH CHUCKLE)
I could tell.

46:03.318 --> 46:05.358
You didn't have that, vibe.

46:05.358 --> 46:07.878
Oh, what, I don't have
the electro, techno vibe?

46:07.878 --> 46:10.038
No. Not at all.
OK.

46:10.038 --> 46:12.078
What sort of vibe
would you say I have?

46:12.078 --> 46:14.518
Kind of serious?
(GLASS PLACED DOWN)
Thank you.

46:14.518 --> 46:17.238
And also... a bit dangerous.

46:18.518 --> 46:20.958
In a good way.
That's a first.

46:20.958 --> 46:23.078
It is?
I'll take it.(CHUCKLES)

46:24.518 --> 46:26.838
I'm working on a venue in London

46:26.838 --> 46:29.198
and the Konsterdisaal's
seen as one of the...

46:29.198 --> 46:32.318
well, one of the great icons
of the form, so.

46:32.318 --> 46:34.358
I wanted to come check it out.

46:36.798 --> 46:38.798
You gonna drink that?

46:39.798 --> 46:41.798
Yeah.
Yeah.

46:45.998 --> 46:47.998
Thoughts?

46:49.318 --> 46:51.398
Really nice.

46:51.398 --> 46:53.518
Yeah?
- No.
- No.

46:53.518 --> 46:55.878
(LAUGHTER)
I fucking hate it.
I can't drink this.

46:55.878 --> 46:58.518
- Getting you a beer.
- Do they even have
beers in a place like this?

46:58.518 --> 47:01.478
I'm sure they have beers and if not
we are taking our custom elsewhere.

47:01.478 --> 47:03.798
Excuse me? Two of your
finest beers, please.

47:03.798 --> 47:05.838
Of course.
