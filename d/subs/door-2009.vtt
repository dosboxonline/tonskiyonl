01:41.526 --> 01:45.257
The Door

02:24.001 --> 02:26.868
What are you waiting for, Daddy?

02:41.152 --> 02:43.518
What are you waiting for, Daddy?

03:00.938 --> 03:02.633
We were going to CatCh butterflies!

03:02.773 --> 03:05.503
- Mom will be home soon.
- Please! Please, Daddy!

03:05.643 --> 03:09.135
- Leonie, I have to piCk
something up and then we'll play, okay?

03:25.496 --> 03:27.623
Quiet! Siesta!

03:37.141 --> 03:39.336
Don't be afraid, Mr. Butterfly.

03:54.158 --> 03:56.388
Where have you been all week?

03:56.894 --> 03:58.862
I was working, for an exhibition.

04:02.433 --> 04:04.663
I thought you'd gone away.

04:04.802 --> 04:06.394
I sleep during the day.

04:11.208 --> 04:12.402
Gia...

04:12.743 --> 04:15.735
We just had sex a few times.

04:16.213 --> 04:17.680
Come on.

04:19.283 --> 04:21.375
I didn't think
it would be a regular thing.

04:26.357 --> 04:27.881
Asshole!

05:25.650 --> 05:26.878
Leonie?

06:32.983 --> 06:35.645
5 years later

06:49.800 --> 06:50.994
Maja?

06:51.836 --> 06:55.169
Can I...?
- No, you Can't. I warned you!

06:56.107 --> 06:57.165
Maja, please!

06:59.477 --> 07:01.138
What do you want?

07:09.420 --> 07:11.354
What do you want to hear?

07:13.824 --> 07:15.985
"I forgive you, David?"

07:16.794 --> 07:18.125
Does that sound okay?

07:19.563 --> 07:20.552
No...

07:21.065 --> 07:22.123
No?

07:25.436 --> 07:30.100
"I forgive you that our daughter died
'Cause you fuCked the neighbor?" Right?

07:32.309 --> 07:34.209
Feel better now?

07:37.848 --> 07:40.339
Now get out of my life.
- Maja, please...

07:45.089 --> 07:46.852
Why Can't you just leave her alone?

07:48.993 --> 07:50.460
You love her, too!

08:04.041 --> 08:07.477
<i>"You've reached Maja and Edgar.</i>
<i>We're not home right now.</i>

08:07.978 --> 08:10.503
<i>Please leave a message</i>
<i>after the beep."</i>

08:12.449 --> 08:13.438
<i>Maja...</i>

08:14.785 --> 08:17.117
<i>I will never bother you again.</i>

08:19.557 --> 08:22.526
<i>No more visits, no more calls.</i>

08:24.061 --> 08:25.358
<i>And I'm...</i>

08:41.212 --> 08:43.976
Yes... I am very sorry.

09:01.332 --> 09:02.993
<i>What are you waiting for, Daddy?</i>

10:00.491 --> 10:02.982
<i>What are you waiting for, Daddy?</i>

10:03.327 --> 10:05.124
Nothing anymore.

10:40.931 --> 10:42.228
Daddy!

10:51.108 --> 10:52.097
Breathe!

10:52.476 --> 10:53.500
Breathe!

11:04.355 --> 11:07.381
Max, what are you doing here?

11:08.058 --> 11:09.116
Maja Called me.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.223
She was worried.

11:29.446 --> 11:31.971
You'll stay in our guest room tonight.
- No, thanks.

11:32.316 --> 11:35.979
It wasrt a question. Your self-pity
won't work with me, AndernaCh.

11:45.095 --> 11:46.892
How's your family?

11:47.664 --> 11:49.825
I enrolled the boys into a soCCer Club.

11:50.200 --> 11:54.603
It's Crazy. 3- and 4-year-olds
playing soCCer, that's a sight!

11:55.139 --> 11:57.107
22 of those dwarfs on the field

11:57.508 --> 12:00.602
and twiCe as many parents on
the sideline shouting their hearts out.

12:29.306 --> 12:31.604
I'm not gonna hang myself
in the toilets.

16:27.944 --> 16:29.434
Quiet! Siesta!

17:55.999 --> 17:57.296
Are you hurt?

18:32.402 --> 18:34.336
Don't tell Mom!

18:35.205 --> 18:37.696
She told me to tie my laCes.

21:57.641 --> 21:58.938
No...

22:13.056 --> 22:14.421
No, no, no!

22:54.097 --> 22:55.155
Daddy?

23:01.571 --> 23:03.562
Go to your room, Leonie.

23:08.445 --> 23:11.073
What are you playing?
- Go to your room!

23:14.417 --> 23:16.009
Be a good girl.

25:19.142 --> 25:21.269
Hello?
- It's me.

25:22.412 --> 25:24.539
Maja?
- Where were you? I Called earlier...

25:25.081 --> 25:27.515
We're playing in the garden.

25:28.418 --> 25:31.285
<i>I couldn't get rid of</i>
<i>the pharmaceuticals rep. I'll be late.</i>

25:34.257 --> 25:36.919
When?
- As soon as I'm done here.

25:37.293 --> 25:41.161
<i>Could you watch Leonie on Friday, too?</i>
<i>They need me here at the pharmacy.</i>

25:41.865 --> 25:44.333
Not if it's too muCh...
- No, no.

25:45.568 --> 25:47.035
I'll be here.

25:47.537 --> 25:49.129
<i>Okay. See you later.</i>

25:49.505 --> 25:50.597
See you.

29:20.483 --> 29:21.780
Everything alright?

29:22.985 --> 29:25.818
Yes, I was just looking at you.

29:34.831 --> 29:35.889
Is Leonie upstairs?

29:36.499 --> 29:37.796
Could you get her?

29:38.935 --> 29:40.459
We have a guest.

29:42.338 --> 29:45.068
He was in front of me at the supermarket
and Couldrt pay for his beer.

30:03.926 --> 30:05.553
A glass?
- No, thanks.

30:16.339 --> 30:19.001
There. Say stop.
- Stop!

30:29.685 --> 30:32.654
What's with your video installation
for the bank?

30:32.788 --> 30:34.551
The board hated it.

30:36.125 --> 30:40.892
I told them I studied with the famous
David AndernaCh. They werert impressed.

30:41.264 --> 30:43.892
Don't worry, at his last exhibition

30:44.267 --> 30:46.633
his art dealer
introduCed me as "his wife".

30:47.170 --> 30:49.297
He Can't remember my name.
We are just your shadows.

30:51.107 --> 30:53.200
Nonsense.
- Says the sun!

31:09.592 --> 31:11.423
What happened?
- She fell off her bike.

31:14.130 --> 31:16.621
Your daddy should buy you a helmet.
- He's not my daddy.

31:19.635 --> 31:21.535
It's nothing serious.
- Say that again!

31:32.381 --> 31:35.111
Just wait till she's 15!

31:38.654 --> 31:41.020
Tell me about it, sweetheart.

31:41.557 --> 31:43.354
Where did you get that graze?

31:45.261 --> 31:46.523
Does it hurt?

31:47.663 --> 31:49.130
Do you feel dizzy?

31:54.370 --> 31:56.338
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

31:58.474 --> 32:00.066
If you're ready.

32:04.380 --> 32:09.283
Even if you're angry with Dad,
don't say things like that, okay?

33:27.163 --> 33:29.256
Well, it's not finished yet.

33:31.133 --> 33:32.896
SinCe when
do you justify your paintings?

33:36.405 --> 33:37.872
I don't know.

33:39.008 --> 33:42.034
I'm sorry about what happened today.
I should've told you.

33:42.411 --> 33:44.038
So what did happen?

33:44.880 --> 33:45.869
I sColded her

33:46.248 --> 33:48.011
beCause she tripped
over her shoelaCes.

33:48.150 --> 33:50.584
Then she was whiney,
wanted to watCh TV,

33:50.720 --> 33:52.688
and I didn't let her.

33:53.222 --> 33:54.849
Why would she say something like that?

33:55.224 --> 33:59.160
No idea. BeCause she's mad at me?
You know what she's like.

34:02.098 --> 34:03.998
I yelled at her. I'm sorry.

34:08.170 --> 34:10.934
We struggle from one day to the next.

34:11.407 --> 34:12.965
You know that.

34:14.643 --> 34:16.270
And Leonie senses it.

34:19.382 --> 34:20.371
I thought

34:20.916 --> 34:23.315
we were fine.
- SinCe when?

34:29.190 --> 34:31.989
You admit a few old affairs
and everything's fine?

34:37.366 --> 34:38.389
Yes.

34:39.435 --> 34:42.427
I need Gregor's ex-wife's number.
I want to invite her on Saturday.

34:45.341 --> 34:46.330

34:47.009 --> 34:48.498
Your birthday party.

34:49.210 --> 34:50.438
Right. Yes.

34:51.547 --> 34:53.572
It's on your mobile.

34:57.286 --> 34:59.618

35:03.926 --> 35:05.917

35:43.365 --> 35:45.196
Quiet! Siesta!

35:48.103 --> 35:49.092
Just kidding.

35:50.206 --> 35:55.041
You gave me a fright this afternoon.
Crashing head on into that truCk.

35:56.612 --> 35:58.603
You prefer not to talk?

35:59.381 --> 36:00.473
<i>O</i> h well,

38:02.871 --> 38:03.895

Who is this?

38:09.845 --> 38:11.369

38:12.247 --> 38:14.238
You're using my husband's mobile.

Just a moment.

38:16.986 --> 38:18.851
I Called your mobile.

38:21.523 --> 38:22.547
AndernaCh?

38:23.092 --> 38:24.992

40:22.478 --> 40:24.639
Where are you going?

40:29.184 --> 40:31.584
What about us?
- I have a family.

40:32.955 --> 40:35.617
And you don't want to hurt them.
- ExaCtly.

40:39.895 --> 40:40.953
Sleep with me.

40:41.330 --> 40:43.525
I just told you...

40:44.066 --> 40:47.160
We're soul mates. Don't you feel that?

40:49.671 --> 40:51.195
Sleep with me!

40:51.974 --> 40:53.373
<i>O</i> r I'll tell your wife.

40:56.011 --> 40:59.412

Say it.

41:02.284 --> 41:04.616
Say what?
- Say you'll sleep with me.

41:05.154 --> 41:06.416
Now.

41:08.624 --> 41:09.818
No.

41:12.561 --> 41:14.654
Then why are you still here?

41:30.245 --> 41:32.008
Go and say thank you.

41:32.381 --> 41:33.439
Thank you.

41:34.650 --> 41:36.015
CatCh, mommy!

41:36.552 --> 41:37.576
Can I have a go?

41:38.120 --> 41:39.644
Could I get a Coffee?

41:39.788 --> 41:43.246
Sure, I'll make you one.
With milk, or iCe Coffee?

41:43.625 --> 41:46.185
She makes a great iCe Coffee.
- Surprise me.

41:50.999 --> 41:53.593
You want one too, Mommy?
- Yes.

42:00.442 --> 42:03.002
If I didn't love you so muCh,
I'd smaCk you in the faCe.

42:18.393 --> 42:22.329
I'm not Cheating on Maja.
- So why Creep out of that house?

42:29.371 --> 42:32.033
Can you keep a seCret?
- Spare me your bedroom stories.

42:32.407 --> 42:35.604
Max, Can you keep a seCret?

42:44.453 --> 42:47.581
I don't know where to start.
This whole thing's Crazy.

42:52.160 --> 42:55.186
The old David had a fling with her.

42:55.931 --> 42:57.421
And you're the new one?

42:59.134 --> 43:01.329
I'm not the David you know.

43:02.571 --> 43:04.300
I'm five years older.

43:05.607 --> 43:07.074
The day before yesterday in 2008

43:07.442 --> 43:11.310
I found a tunnel leading up to a door

43:11.847 --> 43:14.247
and behind it was... here.

43:16.485 --> 43:20.319
Everything was alright again.
Leonie was alive, and Maja...

43:20.856 --> 43:25.418
Are you making fun of a drunk?
- It's the truth, Max! Look at me.

43:25.961 --> 43:29.897
I'm five years older.
I dyed my hair. Look at me.

43:30.265 --> 43:32.631
And where's the younger David?

43:35.070 --> 43:37.004
It was an aCCident.

43:38.974 --> 43:41.204
I buried him in the garden.

43:43.211 --> 43:44.337
Where else?

43:46.982 --> 43:47.971
Listen.

43:48.350 --> 43:51.581
Be an asshole, ruin your family,
but spare me this bullshit.

43:52.254 --> 43:53.516
I know your sons' names.

43:54.890 --> 43:57.085
Max, I know your future wife.

43:58.360 --> 44:01.887
Soon you'll be in great demand.
People will buy your work.

44:02.264 --> 44:05.358
It'll be shown at the "DoCumenta".

44:06.401 --> 44:08.426
What are they Called?
- Who?

44:08.971 --> 44:09.995
My sons.

44:12.074 --> 44:14.508
The little one Caspar,
the bigger one FriedriCh.

44:24.519 --> 44:26.180
You're the best liar I know.

44:27.322 --> 44:29.256
I'm not lying, Max.

44:58.086 --> 44:59.212
It won't get any better than that.

44:59.588 --> 45:01.112
See you next time.

45:09.064 --> 45:11.362
You must be Leonie's father.

45:13.502 --> 45:14.992
Say hello to Maja.

45:16.538 --> 45:17.562
Certainly not.

45:29.284 --> 45:32.378
What's your musiC teaCher like?
Is he niCe?

45:36.324 --> 45:39.816
He's awful.
Learning to play the flute is awful.

45:40.195 --> 45:42.425
Playing the flute is awful, too.

45:46.101 --> 45:49.264
How about a deal? I get a hug, and

45:49.638 --> 45:52.072
you don't have to go
to musiC Class again.

45:52.207 --> 45:53.936
Mommy deCides that.

45:55.077 --> 45:56.567
But I Can talk to her.

46:10.392 --> 46:12.553
You said one.

46:41.056 --> 46:44.184
I don't Care. I don't want to go there.

46:45.927 --> 46:46.985
No,

46:47.362 --> 46:49.159
we'll talk about it tomorrow.
- Hi, David.

46:49.631 --> 46:50.928
Hello, Susanne.

47:05.413 --> 47:07.005
How are my two beauties?

47:07.516 --> 47:09.074
I'll show you how it's done. Ready?

47:09.484 --> 47:11.509
Max already showed me.
- Did he?

47:12.053 --> 47:15.352
Right, you take the rubber band,
hook it up there,

47:15.891 --> 47:17.859
pull on it with all your might,

47:18.226 --> 47:20.057
and then... release it!

47:39.114 --> 47:40.376
It stinks!

47:46.054 --> 47:47.487
I Can't smell anything.

47:50.025 --> 47:53.620
Maybe a mole
had to go to the toilet.

47:54.162 --> 47:57.222
Your daddy is funny.
- He's not my daddy.

47:58.099 --> 47:59.623
So who am I?

48:00.168 --> 48:01.465
A monster?

48:16.918 --> 48:18.283
And now Leonie.

48:19.521 --> 48:20.818
Leonie doesn't dare.

48:22.190 --> 48:25.318
I'm not afraid of you.
- There's no need to be.

48:59.461 --> 49:01.292
That's a new one, right?

49:50.011 --> 49:51.478
Can I have one?

49:58.353 --> 50:01.550
The last one I smoked was just
before my pregnanCy test. - Yes...

50:04.492 --> 50:05.584
I remember.

50:12.367 --> 50:13.925
That's good.

50:23.545 --> 50:25.240
Is that really how you see us?

50:33.221 --> 50:34.210
No.

50:58.079 --> 51:00.570
I mistrusted you for so long.

51:01.850 --> 51:03.943
I have to get used to it again.

51:35.550 --> 51:37.108
What are you reading?

51:37.485 --> 51:39.077
CZECH FAIRY TALES

51:44.125 --> 51:46.025
What did you do to daddy?

51:51.266 --> 51:53.291
I saw blood.

51:54.135 --> 51:55.659
<i>O</i> h, that.

51:57.238 --> 52:02.107
We were fighting for fun
and then he got a nosebleed.

52:02.477 --> 52:04.308
So daddy's still alive?

52:04.979 --> 52:06.606
Yes, of Course.

52:07.482 --> 52:08.540
Where?

52:12.187 --> 52:13.381
Far away.

52:14.622 --> 52:16.817
Can I Call him?

52:21.963 --> 52:24.363
Can I write him a letter?

52:32.040 --> 52:34.099
Do you know what a guardian angel is?

52:40.682 --> 52:42.013
Are you one?

52:43.351 --> 52:45.046
All fathers are.

52:46.187 --> 52:48.951
They proteCt their daughters.
That's their job.

52:51.526 --> 52:56.190
But your father didn't do his job.
He wasrt there when it mattered.

52:57.398 --> 53:01.164
That's why I traded plaCes with him.

53:03.938 --> 53:05.872
I'm like him, only...

53:06.474 --> 53:07.532
Better?

53:09.878 --> 53:11.436
I'll try.

53:19.220 --> 53:21.950
Why didn't he say goodbye to me?

53:24.893 --> 53:27.054
I think he was too ashamed.

54:13.541 --> 54:18.103
"But now let me pose you a riddle
so you Can have a little fun again.

54:18.479 --> 54:21.846
How about this one: 'In through
one hole, out through two,

54:22.216 --> 54:26.243
and only onCe you're outside
you're truly inside."'

54:28.489 --> 54:30.081
There it is!

54:36.598 --> 54:38.065
Good night, Daddy.

54:40.335 --> 54:41.461
Good night.

54:44.973 --> 54:46.964
"Warily, the prinCess looked at Andres.

54:47.342 --> 54:52.109
'What happens if I Can't solve it? '
'Nothing, unless you give me a kiss."'

56:25.440 --> 56:27.840
I love you...

56:47.328 --> 56:48.556
Blow!

56:51.999 --> 56:54.024
What?
- MagiC!

57:22.930 --> 57:25.091
Happy Birthday!
- Thanks.

57:28.102 --> 57:29.467
Are you happy?

57:50.992 --> 57:52.926
Thanks for the invitation.

57:55.096 --> 57:56.427
You're welCome.

58:31.499 --> 58:35.799
The Greves have to go home to relieve
the babysitter. Can you see them out?

59:16.377 --> 59:17.969
David, I wanted to...

01:00:07.328 --> 01:00:08.886
It was an aCCident.

01:00:21.642 --> 01:00:23.371
Who the hell are you?

01:00:26.948 --> 01:00:29.041
I tried to explain, Max.

01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:34.485
Does Maja know?

01:00:45.232 --> 01:00:46.631
Max, wait!

01:00:49.337 --> 01:00:52.170
You killed David.
- I am David!

01:01:01.482 --> 01:01:03.916
I'm going to talk to Maja.
- Max, I...

01:01:04.685 --> 01:01:06.585
She has to know who you are.

01:01:08.222 --> 01:01:09.621
You're a murderer!

01:01:22.003 --> 01:01:23.595
That should have been your job.

01:01:24.205 --> 01:01:26.935
That asshole wanted to betray you.
Come on!

01:01:28.109 --> 01:01:29.906
Don't touCh him!

01:01:31.579 --> 01:01:35.845
You're not gonna bury him in the garden
again like some amateur? Come on!

01:01:36.417 --> 01:01:38.612
<i>O</i> r are you waiting
for your wife and daughter to Come out?

01:02:12.153 --> 01:02:16.055
I hate moments like this.
You never know what to say.

01:02:20.194 --> 01:02:23.425
It looks niCer here in the daytime,
with sunshine and birds Chirping.

01:02:37.044 --> 01:02:39.069
He was going to betray you.

01:02:39.447 --> 01:02:41.574
It was the only way and you know it.

01:04:38.299 --> 01:04:41.029
Maja?
- Where were you the whole time?

01:04:41.402 --> 01:04:44.337
Just a moment.
- DanCe with me, Come on!

01:04:45.206 --> 01:04:48.607
Go home, will you?
- Hey, what's wrong with you?

01:04:51.445 --> 01:04:53.606
Listen to me. We're in danger.

01:04:54.148 --> 01:04:56.378
Put on your Coat.
I'll get Leonie.

01:05:01.155 --> 01:05:02.144
ExCuse me.

01:05:08.095 --> 01:05:09.289
Let her sleep.

01:05:09.430 --> 01:05:11.295
- We have to get out of here.
- Why?

01:05:11.432 --> 01:05:13.229
Trust me. Come on.

01:05:28.916 --> 01:05:29.940
David!

01:05:34.555 --> 01:05:36.352
Where are you going?

01:05:50.204 --> 01:05:54.903
I Can't explain now. Wait... here.
Wait till we're on the other side.

01:05:55.242 --> 01:05:57.904
What other side?
- Maja, please.

01:05:59.346 --> 01:06:02.782
I'm just trying to proteCt you.
- From what?

01:06:03.484 --> 01:06:07.113
A few steps.
That's all I ask of you, okay?

01:06:10.958 --> 01:06:12.152
Careful, Careful.

01:06:12.893 --> 01:06:15.293
We're almost there. Come on.

01:06:22.536 --> 01:06:23.867
Mommy, I'm Cold.

01:06:24.238 --> 01:06:25.398
Me, too.

01:06:25.939 --> 01:06:28.305
Daddy just wants to show us something.

01:07:19.493 --> 01:07:23.759
You Can run wherever you like.
I'll find you and shoot you.

01:07:24.264 --> 01:07:27.028
Here or on the other side.

01:07:27.601 --> 01:07:29.899
There's no going baCk for anyone.

01:08:24.358 --> 01:08:26.451
What was that about last night?

01:08:33.367 --> 01:08:38.532
I had to take Max home beCause
he'd had it but he wanted to party on.

01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:41.032
And then...

01:08:43.577 --> 01:08:46.603
Well, he talked me
into smoking a joint with him.

01:08:49.883 --> 01:08:51.282
Was I really out of it?

01:08:52.519 --> 01:08:54.850
Don't pretend you Can't remember.

01:08:59.626 --> 01:09:01.423
What were we doing in that tunnel?

01:09:10.404 --> 01:09:12.133
And where did you get that injury?

01:09:14.908 --> 01:09:16.375
You were totally paniCking.

01:09:16.910 --> 01:09:18.502
You sCared the hell out of me.

01:09:19.046 --> 01:09:21.139
I was high, Maja, I'm sorry.

01:09:24.585 --> 01:09:26.484
I will never smoke a joint again.

01:09:32.826 --> 01:09:34.850
I'm going to kiCk Max' ass for that.

01:09:39.032 --> 01:09:41.330
But wait till he's sober again.

01:10:25.212 --> 01:10:27.976
My heating pipes are Causing trouble.
I need someone to hold the ladder.

01:10:45.132 --> 01:10:47.157
Can I borrow him, Mrs. AndernaCh?
- No problem.

01:10:47.234 --> 01:10:48.223
- Thanks.

01:10:53.073 --> 01:10:55.132
Come on, we have to talk. Please.

01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:01.139
Something to drink?

01:11:02.215 --> 01:11:04.945
CognaC, gin, JÃ¤germeister?

01:11:11.058 --> 01:11:13.322
Lemon?
- I don't want a drink.

01:11:23.003 --> 01:11:23.992
Relax!

01:11:28.575 --> 01:11:29.837
Soundproof walls.

01:11:33.513 --> 01:11:36.607
SinCe I got here
I Can't sleep more than 4 hours tops.

01:11:37.150 --> 01:11:39.812
I never Could stand the sight of blood.
Even as a kid.

01:11:39.953 --> 01:11:41.853
And my dad was a butCher.

01:11:44.324 --> 01:11:46.053
Ah well, fuCk it.

01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:48.587
There's always a CatCh.

01:11:50.530 --> 01:11:53.158
Want me to tell you how I Came over?

01:11:54.067 --> 01:11:57.093
A few weeks ago
I was granted a day off from prison.

01:11:57.471 --> 01:12:01.601
Failure to file bankruptCy, assault,
parking tiCkets, bla bla... 8.5 years!

01:12:02.976 --> 01:12:04.307
I felt like

01:12:04.444 --> 01:12:07.538
CheCking out my old life, so I walked
through my patCh and saw the tunnel.

01:12:08.081 --> 01:12:10.879
Then I realized there are two worlds.

01:12:11.251 --> 01:12:14.345
And this one's 5 years earlier.
I thought: "That's great!"

01:12:16.156 --> 01:12:18.852
I left all the Crap behind.

01:12:22.496 --> 01:12:24.623
Now I live off of sports betting.

01:12:25.298 --> 01:12:28.199
There's a fortune in it
when you know the results.

01:12:28.568 --> 01:12:31.867
And the other you?
- You know how it works.

01:12:36.576 --> 01:12:38.908
I didn't want to kill him.

01:12:41.181 --> 01:12:44.344
Your buddy
was absolutely right about one thing:

01:12:45.052 --> 01:12:46.485
We are murderers.

01:12:47.421 --> 01:12:49.446
It's the priCe we pay for our happiness.

01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:53.388
The fuCking admission fee, so to speak.

01:12:53.994 --> 01:12:56.554
We have all paid this priCe.

01:12:58.098 --> 01:13:00.259
"We"?
- We.

01:13:02.269 --> 01:13:03.827
How many are we?

01:13:04.404 --> 01:13:06.201
We are plenty.

01:13:08.141 --> 01:13:10.871
Do you think you're the first one
who Can't handle the stress?

01:13:11.244 --> 01:13:15.044
Who's got trouble adjusting?
HomesiCkness, guilty ConsCienCe...

01:13:15.415 --> 01:13:16.814
I've seen it all.

01:13:17.184 --> 01:13:19.118
Some wanted to go baCk straight away,

01:13:19.252 --> 01:13:20.981
some wanted to spare
their predeCessors,

01:13:21.354 --> 01:13:24.812
some wanted to go to the Cops...
You're no exCeption.

01:13:26.259 --> 01:13:29.592
They're all buried
in the forest next to your buddy.

01:13:30.263 --> 01:13:31.287
Cheers.

01:14:11.071 --> 01:14:12.902
Mom, Can I eat at Nele's?

01:14:13.039 --> 01:14:15.098
RiCe pudding with Cinnamon!

01:14:15.609 --> 01:14:17.577
They held their breath, I had to!

01:14:18.111 --> 01:14:20.875
Sure, riCe is healthy.
- Shall we go to the playground?

01:14:21.014 --> 01:14:21.844
Yes!

01:14:21.948 --> 01:14:24.007
Careful Crossing the street!

01:14:28.421 --> 01:14:31.390
I owe you one.
- Susanne? Wait a moment!

01:14:36.363 --> 01:14:37.421
What's up?

01:14:38.865 --> 01:14:40.560
Nothing. I just wanted to say hi.

01:14:41.601 --> 01:14:44.331
Is Leonie going to play with Nele?
- I'm Cooking for them.

01:14:44.871 --> 01:14:47.931
Call me when you're done.
I'll piCk her up.

01:14:52.312 --> 01:14:54.337
Does he want to be father of the year?

01:14:55.448 --> 01:14:56.847
See you later.

01:15:10.230 --> 01:15:12.255
Pull yourself together!

01:15:17.304 --> 01:15:19.135
I Can't do this!

01:15:51.605 --> 01:15:52.629
Put the sand on it.

01:16:09.422 --> 01:16:12.414
I'm hungry.
- Me too.

01:16:32.946 --> 01:16:33.913
Faster!

01:16:34.414 --> 01:16:36.211
Faster!

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:47.927
Stay here!

01:16:57.971 --> 01:16:59.268
Go in! David!

01:17:00.974 --> 01:17:04.137
What happened?
- No! Stay here!

01:17:04.511 --> 01:17:07.139
You're hurting me!
I want to go home.

01:17:07.847 --> 01:17:11.783
What happened?
- Susanne and Paul are dead.

01:17:12.152 --> 01:17:14.211
Sit down, and stay there.

01:17:16.856 --> 01:17:19.381
<i>O</i> kay, Calm down first. Talk to me.

01:17:20.427 --> 01:17:24.227
A man and woman who looked like
Susanna and Paul... they killed them.

01:17:24.597 --> 01:17:25.723
I saw it!

01:17:25.865 --> 01:17:28.993
- I believe you.
- Then don't tell me to Calm down!

01:17:31.571 --> 01:17:32.538
Don't do it.

01:17:35.408 --> 01:17:37.308
What were we doing in that tunnel?

01:17:38.011 --> 01:17:39.273
Hang up.
- <i>O</i> r what?

01:17:40.413 --> 01:17:42.472
Don't touCh me!

01:18:01.901 --> 01:18:05.530

- Easy, now!

01:18:48.415 --> 01:18:52.249
Don't go with her, she's not your mom!
Look at her eyes!

01:18:52.619 --> 01:18:54.177
Look into her eyes!

01:18:54.554 --> 01:18:58.149
Do something! Get her baCk!
Look into her eyes!

01:18:58.525 --> 01:19:01.392

01:19:04.397 --> 01:19:05.921
Bring her baCk.

01:19:28.488 --> 01:19:32.424
Mr. AndernaCh, you should
keep a Closer eye on your wife.

01:19:32.959 --> 01:19:36.360
Until now, we haven't had
any trouble in this neighborhood.

01:19:49.309 --> 01:19:50.401
Hello?

01:19:51.244 --> 01:19:54.145
<i>It's me. Maja.</i>

<i>Can we talk?</i>

01:20:27.013 --> 01:20:28.571
Hello, David.

01:20:30.083 --> 01:20:31.015
What do you want?

01:20:31.951 --> 01:20:34.010
The same as you.

01:20:35.488 --> 01:20:38.389
Where I've Come from,
my daughter is dead.

01:20:39.926 --> 01:20:41.325
And here she's alive.

01:20:47.834 --> 01:20:49.927
I want to be with her.

01:20:51.471 --> 01:20:52.995
With both of you.

01:20:59.479 --> 01:21:02.175
You always wanted me to forgive you.

01:21:04.350 --> 01:21:06.944
Let's make a new start.

01:21:52.632 --> 01:21:54.224
Don't worry, Mom.

01:21:54.601 --> 01:21:58.196
Nele has got better parents now.

01:22:00.940 --> 01:22:04.842
The other ones had to go,
beCause they didn't take Care of Nele.

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:08.941
Who told you that?

01:22:11.651 --> 01:22:14.279
Don't be angry with him.

01:22:14.654 --> 01:22:18.021
I like him more than my old daddy.

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.994
Do you know where the old Daddy is?

01:22:24.664 --> 01:22:27.155
Far away.
- Where?

01:22:27.533 --> 01:22:30.764
Where you Can't Call him
or write him a letter.

01:22:36.476 --> 01:22:40.310
That's not neCessary. I just want to see
my daughter, not sCare anyone.

01:22:41.514 --> 01:22:45.450
Sooner or later his hysteriCal wife
will betray us.

01:22:45.985 --> 01:22:49.512
She's not like us, David.
She's different than us.

01:22:54.661 --> 01:22:57.630
Don't do this to Leonie.
- I am her mother!

01:22:58.164 --> 01:23:02.294
David, it's your fault I lost her.
Don't stop me from getting her baCk!

01:23:02.835 --> 01:23:05.861
You talk too muCh.
- Wait!

01:23:07.373 --> 01:23:10.137
<i>O</i> kay, I'll do it.

01:23:12.245 --> 01:23:13.212
Good.

01:23:14.547 --> 01:23:17.243
Then you Can start showing us
that we Can trust you.

01:23:19.585 --> 01:23:20.916
That you're a good neighbor.

01:23:22.855 --> 01:23:23.981
Here.

01:23:29.429 --> 01:23:31.192
Five minutes.

01:24:01.227 --> 01:24:03.161
It's been a long time!

01:24:04.931 --> 01:24:07.957
Don't worry, I've Changed.

01:24:09.135 --> 01:24:13.469
The woman I used to be
is just a bad memory now.

01:24:14.507 --> 01:24:18.273
I'm really sorry for what I did
to you baCk then. It's wonderful

01:24:18.644 --> 01:24:21.442
that Leonie is fine now.

01:24:26.452 --> 01:24:28.920
Maybe you two Could Come for Coffee?

01:25:25.978 --> 01:25:27.240
Who are you?

01:25:29.549 --> 01:25:31.483
Your husband.
- Liar!

01:25:32.518 --> 01:25:35.009
Listen to me!

01:25:37.156 --> 01:25:38.418
They'll kill you, Maja.

01:25:39.225 --> 01:25:40.715
They'll take Leonie away from you.

01:25:42.328 --> 01:25:43.352
With your help.

01:25:43.996 --> 01:25:44.928
No.

01:25:45.965 --> 01:25:47.364
I know what you did.

01:25:52.939 --> 01:25:54.770
But he forgot about you.

01:26:12.325 --> 01:26:13.815
They'll kill you, Maja.

01:26:14.193 --> 01:26:17.560
Please believe me. You have to leave.
You have to go to the other side.

01:26:22.502 --> 01:26:25.027
Trust me... trust me.

01:26:26.005 --> 01:26:28.098
There is a better world for you two.

01:26:59.171 --> 01:27:00.365
Where are we going?

01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:03.365

01:27:44.250 --> 01:27:46.115
He Can't do it.

01:29:17.576 --> 01:29:19.407
Don't be Crazy! Hand over Maja!

01:29:19.945 --> 01:29:21.378
