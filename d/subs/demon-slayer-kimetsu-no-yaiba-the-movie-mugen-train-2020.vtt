Yukio...

01:06.460 --> 01:07.420
Takahiro...

01:19.360 --> 01:22.360
Master, we should go.

01:23.030 --> 01:24.940
It's not good for your health.

01:27.360 --> 01:32.220
I wonder how long I'll be able
to make the trip here.

01:38.880 --> 01:42.240
I'd like to settle the scores
for these children

01:43.160 --> 01:45.620
who died while I'm in charge.

01:47.880 --> 01:55.670
I've already received seven cases caused by demons this month.

02:00.140 --> 02:02.340
My children in the Demon Slayer Corps...

02:03.230 --> 02:08.169
are on the front lines even as we speak,
fighting the demons.

02:11.440 --> 02:14.660
No matter how many lives
the demons take...

02:54.230 --> 02:56.220
MUGEN

03:19.010 --> 03:23.340
For now, let's hide our swords on our backs.
Oh no! The train's leaving!

03:26.340 --> 03:28.060
Are the police still around?

03:28.060 --> 03:29.840
We'll have to go even if they are.

03:32.230 --> 03:34.820
I'm taking you on! Lord of this land!

03:34.830 --> 03:36.020
Hey, idiot!

03:36.410 --> 03:37.660
We should go, too!

03:39.280 --> 03:40.860
Hey, don't leave me behind!

03:44.030 --> 03:45.910
W-Wait up!

03:47.160 --> 03:49.360
Tanjiro! Inosuke!

03:49.690 --> 03:50.690
Zenitsu!

04:06.590 --> 04:07.790
So fast!

04:08.430 --> 04:09.790
Sorry! We're very sorry!

04:10.230 --> 04:12.610
Forget that! Get over here, idiot!

04:12.610 --> 04:13.810
So freakin' fast!

04:21.060 --> 04:22.720
Ma'am, is that all right?

04:23.060 --> 04:24.610
Thank you.

04:24.610 --> 04:26.060
Sorry to trouble you.

04:26.060 --> 04:26.870
Oh no.

04:26.880 --> 04:29.410
It's the least I can do.

04:39.660 --> 04:41.160
He's a Hashira, right?

04:41.410 --> 04:42.790
This Rengoku person...

04:43.730 --> 04:46.070
Are you sure you'll recognize his face?

04:46.390 --> 04:47.170
Sure,

04:47.510 --> 04:51.220
He had this gaudy hairstyle,
and I remember his scent, too.

04:51.230 --> 04:52.470
Hey!

04:52.810 --> 04:54.890
I think I'll know it's him once we get close.

04:56.480 --> 04:57.640
Delicious!

05:18.380 --> 05:28.670
DEMON SLAYER -KIMETSU NO YAIBA-
THE MOVIE: MUGEN TRAIN

05:30.290 --> 05:31.290
Delicious!

05:32.010 --> 05:32.960
Delicious!

05:34.040 --> 05:34.970
Delicious!

05:37.640 --> 05:38.970
Delicious!

05:40.480 --> 05:41.560
Delicious!

05:43.890 --> 05:45.060
Delicious!

05:46.890 --> 05:47.640
Delicious!

05:49.230 --> 05:50.060
Delicious!

05:51.460 --> 05:52.320
Delicious!

05:54.710 --> 05:55.570
Delicious!

05:57.960 --> 05:58.820
Delicious!

05:59.460 --> 06:01.120
Is that the Flame Hashira guy?

06:01.130 --> 06:02.340
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

06:02.710 --> 06:04.210
Not just some random glutton?

06:04.210 --> 06:05.820
- Delicious!
- Yeah.

06:06.380 --> 06:07.290
Delicious!

06:07.290 --> 06:09.590
Um, excuse me...

06:10.560 --> 06:11.420
Delicious!

06:11.430 --> 06:13.060
R-Rengoku?

06:13.730 --> 06:14.890
Delicious!

06:15.430 --> 06:19.140
Uh, we really get that part already.

06:26.190 --> 06:28.910
And you're the kid
from that day at the Master's.

06:29.190 --> 06:29.990
Yes.

06:30.330 --> 06:31.770
I'm Tanjiro Kamado.

06:32.190 --> 06:37.660
And they are my fellow Demon Slayers,
Zenitsu Agatsuma and Inosuke Hashibira.

06:37.990 --> 06:41.690
I see. And inside that box there...

06:42.030 --> 06:42.910
Yes.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.010
It's my sister Nezuko.

06:45.710 --> 06:48.670
Right! That demon we saw that day, huh?

06:48.680 --> 06:53.090
Since the Master's acknowledged her,
I won't say any word for now.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.340
Have a seat here.

07:05.280 --> 07:08.110
Being inside the lord is mind-blowing!

07:08.110 --> 07:11.770
You're going to break the glass!
Calm down already, will ya?

07:12.060 --> 07:14.440
What are you three doing here?

07:14.890 --> 07:16.270
A mission?

07:16.560 --> 07:18.710
We received an order from a Kasugai Crow.

07:19.040 --> 07:25.290
"The casualties of the Mugen Train are increasing.
Join Rengoku on site," he said.

07:25.660 --> 07:28.910
Yes! I see now! Understood!

07:28.910 --> 07:30.040
Right.

07:30.830 --> 07:33.070
Also, there's one more thing.

07:33.960 --> 07:36.260
Something I wanted to ask you, Rengoku.

07:37.230 --> 07:39.220
What is it? Let's hear it.

07:39.840 --> 07:41.920
About my father...

07:42.260 --> 07:43.970
What about your father?

07:44.840 --> 07:46.670
Well, he was really frail.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.010
Was he really?

07:48.440 --> 07:51.490
But even if it was cold enough
to freeze your lungs,

07:51.490 --> 07:53.190
he could still perform
a kagura dance in the snow.

07:53.190 --> 07:54.490
Well, I'm glad to hear it!

07:56.910 --> 07:57.910
The thing is...

07:57.910 --> 07:58.910
What's up?

07:59.530 --> 08:01.020
Hinokami Kagura...

08:01.580 --> 08:02.570
Dance!

08:03.610 --> 08:07.440
I suddenly found myself doing the kagura
that I'd seen as a child.

08:07.990 --> 08:11.370
If you know anything about that, Rengoku...

08:11.760 --> 08:13.760
I was hoping you'd tell me.

08:19.290 --> 08:20.210
Right!

08:21.210 --> 08:22.620
But I know nothing!

08:23.710 --> 08:26.860
I've never even heard the term "Hinokami Dance" before,

08:27.310 --> 08:32.470
But it's truly commendable that your father was able to adapt his kagura dance to battle.

08:32.809 --> 08:34.860
All right, end of discussion!

08:35.059 --> 08:36.940
Um, can you try to help me a little more?

08:37.360 --> 08:40.770
You should become my Tsuguko my apprentice! Im look after you!

08:40.780 --> 08:44.460
Hold on a second! And just what are you looking at?

08:45.410 --> 08:47.410
He's totally weird, all right.

08:47.410 --> 08:49.990
Flame Breathing has a long history.

08:50.240 --> 08:55.620
In any given era, there's always been a Flame and Water swordsman among the Hashira.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.070
Flame.

08:57.410 --> 08:58.370
Water.

08:58.790 --> 08:59.660
Wind.

09:00.080 --> 09:00.970
Stone.

09:01.310 --> 09:04.090
Thunder. Those are the fundamental
breathing techniques.

09:05.140 --> 09:08.720
The other techniques were created
as offshoots of those five.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.970
Mist is a fork of Wind.

09:12.640 --> 09:13.840
Young Mizoguchi!

09:14.180 --> 09:15.970
What color is your sword?

09:16.810 --> 09:20.110
My name's Kamado. And the color is black.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.610
A black sword, huh?

09:21.940 --> 09:23.660
Well, isn't that unfortunate?

09:25.080 --> 09:26.660
For real?

09:26.940 --> 09:30.310
I've never known a swordsman
with a black sword that became a Hashira.

09:30.530 --> 09:34.670
On top of that, I hear that they have
no clue which style to master.

09:36.680 --> 09:38.620
Come to me, and I'll train you!

09:38.960 --> 09:40.420
You can rest easy now!

09:40.680 --> 09:41.920
No, thank you!

09:41.930 --> 09:44.370
And just what are you looking at?

09:51.730 --> 09:55.270
He's strange, but he seems to be very caring.

09:55.640 --> 09:58.720
And from his scent, I can pick up his strong sense of justice.

10:01.560 --> 10:05.190
Awesome! Awesome! So fast!

10:05.440 --> 10:07.890
That's dangerous, you idiot!

10:07.890 --> 10:11.790
I'm gonna run outside
and race to see who's faster!

10:12.130 --> 10:14.710
- You can't possibly be that stupid, can you?
- That's dangerous.

10:15.790 --> 10:18.460
You never know when a demon might appear.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.960
You're kidding, right? Demons show up on this train?

10:25.840 --> 10:26.720
Sure do!

10:26.730 --> 10:27.890
What? They do?

10:27.890 --> 10:32.560
Nooo! So, we're not heading to where the demons are, but we're here?

10:32.560 --> 10:34.310
Nooo!

10:34.310 --> 10:36.060
I'm getting off!

10:36.760 --> 10:41.590
Over 40 people have disappeared on this train.

10:41.930 --> 10:46.160
The Corps sent a few swordsmen,
but then they all went silent.

10:46.580 --> 10:49.070
That's why I, a Hashira, am here.

10:54.940 --> 10:59.160
Right, I see! I'm getting off! I'm getting off!

11:07.040 --> 11:08.260
May I...

11:08.630 --> 11:09.840
see your...

11:10.430 --> 11:11.710
tickets, please?

11:13.090 --> 11:14.120
What's he doing?

11:14.710 --> 11:18.560
The conductor's going to check your ticket and punch a hole in it.

11:29.980 --> 11:30.940
Here.

11:55.310 --> 11:56.420
What is this?

11:57.060 --> 11:58.840
There's a horrible scent,

12:00.590 --> 12:02.090
Thank you...

12:02.430 --> 12:04.260
very much.

12:08.680 --> 12:09.860
Mr. Conductor...

12:10.190 --> 12:11.990
You could get hurt,
so please step back.

12:12.330 --> 12:16.490
As this is an emergency, please overlook the fact that I have a sword.

12:36.380 --> 12:40.340
Was it a Blood Demon Art that hid that massive body?

12:40.710 --> 12:42.810
I had a hard time detecting you.

12:44.310 --> 12:48.270
But if you bare your fangs
at innocent people...

12:49.780 --> 12:55.220
my bright red Flame Blade will burn you to the bone!

13:00.740 --> 13:02.460
Flame Breathing...

13:02.960 --> 13:04.460
First Form...

13:26.090 --> 13:27.090
Amazing.

13:27.430 --> 13:29.590
He sliced off the demon's head
with one blow.

13:32.930 --> 13:34.590
There's still one more.

13:34.940 --> 13:36.270
Come with me!

13:37.610 --> 13:39.570
All right!

13:40.580 --> 13:43.520
D-Don't leave me behind!

14:02.680 --> 14:05.010
You will not lay a finger on that man!

14:10.360 --> 14:11.940
Didn't you hear me?

14:12.280 --> 14:14.860
I said I'm your opponent.

14:15.230 --> 14:19.360
What the hell is it? It's got long arms!

14:19.360 --> 14:20.440
All right!

14:20.690 --> 14:22.770
- First come, first served!
- Hold up!

14:22.780 --> 14:24.810
We gotta save the passenger first!

14:24.810 --> 14:27.370
It won't matter once I destroy that thing!

14:42.410 --> 14:44.840
You'll be safe in the back of the train. Go on.

14:46.890 --> 14:48.260
We're good to go now.

14:48.640 --> 14:50.260
Let's finish him off in short order.

14:59.060 --> 15:00.360
Flame Breathing...

15:00.860 --> 15:02.360
Second Form...

15:06.190 --> 15:08.020
Rising Scorching Sun!

15:28.590 --> 15:29.540
Tha...

15:30.260 --> 15:31.540
Tha...

15:31.910 --> 15:35.470
That was awesome, Bro! Talk about brilliant sword skills, man!

15:35.980 --> 15:38.310
Please make me your apprentice!

15:38.310 --> 15:41.110
Fine by me! I'll make a fine swordsman out of you!

15:41.110 --> 15:43.110
- Me, too, please!
- Me, three!

15:43.480 --> 15:45.640
I'll train all of you!

15:45.640 --> 15:48.560
Big Bro Rengoku!

15:48.810 --> 15:50.060
Bro!

15:50.060 --> 15:52.120
- Bro!
- Bro!

15:52.490 --> 15:54.990
Big Bro Rengoku!

16:35.690 --> 16:39.360
I did as I was told! I punched their tickets and put them to sleep!

16:39.690 --> 16:43.290
Please! Put me to sleep, too, now!

16:43.630 --> 16:47.760
Please let me be reunited with my dead wife and daughter!

16:48.680 --> 16:50.420
I'm begging you.

16:50.930 --> 16:52.710
I'm begging you.

16:54.040 --> 16:55.620
Sure thing.

17:00.090 --> 17:02.110
You did a good job.

17:04.940 --> 17:06.940
Go to sleep.

17:10.060 --> 17:13.310
Have a nice dream where you can meet your family.

17:14.390 --> 17:15.609
Excuse me.

17:17.880 --> 17:20.790
What do you want us to do?

17:21.960 --> 17:25.790
Their slumber will grow deeper
in a little while.

17:26.130 --> 17:28.460
Wait here until then.

17:28.960 --> 17:35.590
Perceptive Demon Slayers sometimes wake up sensing the presence of bloodthirsty demons.

17:35.930 --> 17:41.060
When you tie the ropes, be careful not to touch their bodies.

17:42.140 --> 17:45.560
I will have to stay in the first car for a while.

17:45.890 --> 17:49.470
Hang on until everything's ready to go...

17:50.090 --> 17:52.990
so that you can have blissful dreams.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.160
Okay.

18:51.330 --> 18:54.210
What's going on? What happened?

19:00.640 --> 19:01.840
Calm down.

19:02.340 --> 19:03.720
Calm down.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.170
You have to calm down.

19:16.560 --> 19:17.570
Hey!

19:17.830 --> 19:19.570
It's Big Bro!

19:19.940 --> 19:21.740
Welcome home, Big Bro!

19:22.080 --> 19:23.660
Did you sell the charcoal?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.340
Big Bro?

19:55.110 --> 19:59.440
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!

20:09.080 --> 20:11.910
To be able to die while dreaming...

20:12.240 --> 20:14.460
Just how lucky are you?

20:15.040 --> 20:18.820
It doesn't matter how powerful
a Demon Slayer you are.

20:19.460 --> 20:25.120
A human's driving force is the heart, the spirit!

20:27.840 --> 20:31.640
All you have to do is destroy the spiritual core.

20:31.980 --> 20:34.010
You can kill them just like that!

20:34.340 --> 20:37.310
All human hearts are the same.

20:37.930 --> 20:43.520
So fragile and weak, like glasswork.

20:45.830 --> 20:48.740
Do we tie ourselves to them by the wrist?

20:49.160 --> 20:53.070
That's right. Don't forget what he warned us about.

21:01.680 --> 21:04.420
Take a deep, slow breath...

21:05.180 --> 21:07.340
while you count.

21:09.130 --> 21:12.340
Do that, and you'll fall asleep.

21:12.710 --> 21:14.120
One...

21:14.460 --> 21:15.510
Two...

21:16.040 --> 21:17.190
Three...

21:17.860 --> 21:19.110
Four...

21:19.940 --> 21:20.940
Five...

21:21.730 --> 21:22.940
Six...

21:28.110 --> 21:32.390
And then, we were surprised because Big Bro suddenly burst into tears!

21:32.690 --> 21:34.290
What a weirdo!

21:35.790 --> 21:39.410
Oh my, you must be exhausted.

21:39.410 --> 21:42.740
It's not such a big deal, okay? I'm fine.

21:45.660 --> 21:48.320
WUR
You don't have a fever, do you?

21:48.710 --> 21:52.340
Take it easy and get some rest today okay?

21:52.980 --> 21:54.340
I'm all right.

21:54.340 --> 21:55.840
Are you sure?

21:56.590 --> 21:58.390
Hey! You come back here!

21:59.680 --> 22:01.060
Gotcha!

22:01.060 --> 22:03.220
What do you think you're doing?

22:03.680 --> 22:07.220
Hey! You stop that right now!

22:10.360 --> 22:14.020
I was having a bad dream or something.

22:16.080 --> 22:19.990
Falling deeper into sleep, deep in their dreams...

22:20.280 --> 22:23.360
Forget to breathe, deep in their dreams...

22:23.740 --> 22:27.120
And even if a demon comes,
deep in their dreams...

22:32.010 --> 22:33.540
Looks like fun.

22:33.960 --> 22:37.120
You're starting to have a happy dream, aren't you?

22:40.530 --> 22:41.870
You are falling...

22:43.110 --> 22:44.390
You are falling...,

22:45.030 --> 22:46.640
into a dream.

22:53.140 --> 22:55.140
It's a deep slumber.

22:56.390 --> 22:57.640
They can...

22:58.360 --> 23:00.740
no longer awaken.

23:00.740 --> 23:02.410
LOWER ONE

23:10.630 --> 23:11.990
This way!

23:12.410 --> 23:14.120
The peaches over here taste great!

23:14.460 --> 23:16.560
And there are tons of white clovers in bloom!

23:16.560 --> 23:18.640
I'll make you a chaplet!

23:19.010 --> 23:21.060
I can make these really great-looking ones...

23:21.560 --> 23:22.720
Nezuko!

23:23.010 --> 23:25.390
Yes! Make a lot, okay...

23:26.230 --> 23:27.760
Zenitsu?

23:34.830 --> 23:38.070
There's a river along the way,
but it's shallow, so you'll be okay, right?

23:38.410 --> 23:39.320
River?

23:41.360 --> 23:43.570
What am I going to do, Zenitsu?

23:44.160 --> 23:46.320
I can't swim.

23:46.910 --> 23:51.340
I-I'll just carry you on my back and jump right over the river!

23:52.010 --> 23:54.340
Not even your toes will get wet, Nezuko!

23:57.540 --> 23:59.840
Just leave it to me!

24:00.380 --> 24:02.340
Let's go!

24:17.480 --> 24:19.440
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

24:19.440 --> 24:21.310
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

24:21.310 --> 24:23.220
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

24:23.230 --> 24:25.060
We're the Cave Expedition Team!

24:25.060 --> 24:26.570
Expedition Team! Expedition Team!

24:26.580 --> 24:27.370
Boss!

24:27.740 --> 24:28.620
Boss!

24:29.290 --> 24:32.370
What's up, Underling 1 and Underling 2?

24:32.960 --> 24:37.040
I can smell the master of this cave
over there, pompoko!

24:37.630 --> 24:40.540
And I can hear it breathing
as it sleeps, squeak!

24:45.230 --> 24:47.060
Here he is!

24:47.310 --> 24:49.640
All right, let's go! Showdown!

24:49.980 --> 24:51.510
- Roger that, Boss!
- Roger that, Boss!

24:52.230 --> 24:55.090
Hey you! Come with me, Underling 3!

24:55.730 --> 24:59.340
Come over here! Look, I'll give you
these sparkly acorns! C'mon!

24:59.590 --> 25:01.440
Let's go!

25:01.780 --> 25:03.770
- Hey!
- Hey!

25:31.880 --> 25:33.540
Why did I come here?

25:37.640 --> 25:38.770
Oh, right.

25:39.110 --> 25:41.270
To report to my father...

25:41.890 --> 25:43.690
that I've become a Hashira.

26:03.490 --> 26:05.870
So what if you've become a Hashira?

26:10.680 --> 26:11.670
Worthless.

26:12.090 --> 26:13.340
It means nothing.

26:14.090 --> 26:17.340
You're never going to amount
to anything anyway.

26:18.230 --> 26:19.640
'Neither you...

26:20.090 --> 26:21.840
nor I.

26:28.160 --> 26:29.270
Brother...

26:31.080 --> 26:34.320
Was our father pleased to hear your news?
father pleased to hear your news?

26:34.610 --> 26:40.570
Do you think our father will acknowledge me
if I become a Hashira, too?

26:43.540 --> 26:45.620
He wasn't always like that.

26:46.710 --> 26:50.210
After all, he did rise to the rank
of Hashira in the Demon Slayer Corps,

26:50.960 --> 26:53.090
He was a passionate man.

26:53.510 --> 26:57.420
And yet, one day, out of the blue,
he quit being a swordsman.

26:58.460 --> 26:59.790
Suddenly.

27:00.860 --> 27:05.270
The man who'd raised us both
with such enthusiasm...

27:09.110 --> 27:10.310
Why?

27:12.860 --> 27:16.270
It's pointless to thinkote about such things, so stop.

27:17.410 --> 27:20.540
it
Senjuro is even worse off.

27:21.460 --> 27:26.370
He barely has any memories of our mother who died of illness when he was very young,

27:26.380 --> 27:28.790
and just look at the state our father is in.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.390
I'm going to be honest.

27:35.980 --> 27:38.840
Our father wasn't happy to hear it.

27:39.260 --> 27:41.510
He told me that it meant nothing.

27:41.840 --> 27:45.760
But that's not enough to extinguish my passion!

27:46.590 --> 27:49.010
This flame inside my heart
will never go out!

27:49.840 --> 27:52.020
I'll never give in!

27:52.330 --> 27:54.020
And Senjuro...

27:56.160 --> 27:58.770
You're not like me.

27:59.410 --> 28:01.240
ou have a big brother...

28:01.830 --> 28:04.270
who believes in his little brother.

28:04.910 --> 28:09.120
No matter what path you take, you're going to become a fine human being!

28:09.540 --> 28:11.540
Keep that burning passion
inside your heart!

28:11.790 --> 28:12.760
Let's do our best!

28:13.380 --> 28:14.960
Let's do our best-and live on!

28:15.590 --> 28:17.260
No matter how lonely-it-gets.

28:24.460 --> 28:25.970
Looking good.

28:26.440 --> 28:28.440
Those ropes that I created are used...

28:28.440 --> 28:32.860
for a special technique that allows one to invade
the dreams of whoever you're tethered to.

28:33.480 --> 28:38.190
I always fight with the utmost caution.

28:38.560 --> 28:43.540
Once you're asleep, Hashira or not,
you're no different than a baby.

28:44.240 --> 28:49.910
I'll enjoy the feast after killing the Demon Slayers.
after klingine Brenton Slayers.

28:58.040 --> 29:00.470
There's no need to swing in such a hurry.

29:01.260 --> 29:02.590
Relax your shoulders.

29:04.310 --> 29:05.260
Like this?

29:05.560 --> 29:06.560
That's right.

29:07.890 --> 29:10.470
Close call. He's right there.

29:11.480 --> 29:13.520
I have to make sure he doesn't see me!

29:15.140 --> 29:17.110
I have to hurry to the edge of the dream!

29:17.940 --> 29:19.020
Hurry!

29:20.940 --> 29:24.240
The dream world I show them isn't infinite.

29:25.440 --> 29:29.410
It's circular, with the dreamer in its center.

29:30.440 --> 29:37.340
The realm of the subconscious exists just outside the dream, where you'll find the spiritual core.

29:38.290 --> 29:40.260
That's what you must destroy.

29:41.290 --> 29:46.010
Do that, and the dreamer will become crippled.

29:53.560 --> 29:54.520
There it is!

29:55.280 --> 29:59.020
The scenery doesn't end here, but you can't go any further.

30:02.230 --> 30:05.360
I'll destroy his spiritual core right away!

30:08.230 --> 30:12.160
And then, I'll get to see a happy dream myself!

30:21.880 --> 30:24.240
What an odd realm of the subconscious.

30:24.830 --> 30:25.970
It's hot,

30:26.260 --> 30:27.510
It's burning up.

30:28.480 --> 30:29.810
I have to hurry.

30:46.410 --> 30:47.360
Found it!

30:47.690 --> 30:49.410
The spiritual core!

30:51.580 --> 30:53.660
I've never seen a red one before.

30:57.740 --> 30:59.920
All I have to do is destroy this and...

31:00.180 --> 31:01.710
It'll be my turn to...

31:25.030 --> 31:30.640
I thought humans couldn't move while they were under a spell.

31:34.540 --> 31:37.490
What a strong survival instinct he has!

31:44.740 --> 31:48.910
I'm going to make your favorite
rice crackers today, Tanjiro.

31:49.160 --> 31:50.570
Wow!

31:50.830 --> 31:53.970
I'll start breaking old rice cakes first.

31:53.980 --> 31:56.390
It's our lucky day, Rokuta!
Rice crackers!

31:56.760 --> 32:01.170
No fair! Big Bro's not the only one
who likes rice crackers!

32:01.510 --> 32:03.640
- I like them, too!
- Me, too!

32:03.930 --> 32:06.590
Then, let's eat them together, okay?

32:06.930 --> 32:08.610
Can you get the grill ready for me?

32:08.610 --> 32:10.160
Okay!

32:10.440 --> 32:12.490
I'll crush them up in the grinding bowl!

32:12.490 --> 32:15.190
Okay, I'll be in charge of flipping them over, then!

32:15.190 --> 32:16.660
Me, too!

32:16.660 --> 32:19.270
Okay, then, I'll be in charge of eating them!

32:19.280 --> 32:20.940
No fair!

32:34.790 --> 32:36.370
There.

32:37.260 --> 32:39.590
Nezuko, let's go.

32:48.960 --> 32:49.940
What did I just say?

32:52.940 --> 32:54.110
I'm back!

32:56.040 --> 32:57.720
Welcome home, Tanjiro.

32:58.440 --> 32:59.910
Yeah, I'm home!

33:01.960 --> 33:03.540
Welcome home, Big Bro!

33:06.740 --> 33:08.660
Huh? Where's Nezuko?

33:08.990 --> 33:11.660
Big Sis went up the mountain
to pick vegetables.

33:12.790 --> 33:14.070
In broad daylight?

33:16.610 --> 33:18.010
She's not supposed to?

33:19.480 --> 33:20.420
Well...

33:20.760 --> 33:21.890
Um...

33:22.230 --> 33:23.090
Tanjiro...

33:23.430 --> 33:25.170
Could you get the bath ready?

33:25.510 --> 33:28.010
I'm going to be busy with this for a while.

33:31.390 --> 33:33.560
I keep saying all these strange things.

33:34.830 --> 33:36.440
Am I tired maybe?

33:43.160 --> 33:45.440
tis.gone.

33:47.240 --> 33:50.020
I wonder what that was for just a split second.

33:50.690 --> 33:51.870
A toolbox perhaps?

33:55.960 --> 33:58.010
I guess my eyes were playing tricks on me.

34:00.930 --> 34:01.710
Wake up!

34:05.380 --> 34:06.210
Wake up!

34:10.610 --> 34:11.310
Wake up!

34:11.770 --> 34:13.139
You're under attack!

34:13.480 --> 34:14.389
It's a dream!

34:14.639 --> 34:15.889
This is a dream!

34:18.060 --> 34:20.389
I see... That's right, I'm...

34:21.980 --> 34:23.560
on board the train!

34:23.980 --> 34:25.409
Wake up and fight!

34:25.830 --> 34:26.909
Fight!

34:28.080 --> 34:30.790
Fight!

34:35.330 --> 34:37.320
Big Bro, give me your pickled radishes!

34:37.330 --> 34:39.909
No, you don't! You stop it right now!

34:40.489 --> 34:43.510
Why are you always taking food away from Big Bro?

34:43.510 --> 34:44.920
What's your problem?

34:44.929 --> 34:46.760
You just had seconds!

34:49.639 --> 34:53.010
No good! I'm not awake yet!
I'm still inside a dream!

34:53.560 --> 34:55.340
How can I get out of it?

34:55.340 --> 34:57.510
Now that I've realized that it's a dream...

34:58.590 --> 35:00.520
What am I supposed to do?

35:18.340 --> 35:20.090
I have to wake up...

35:58.080 --> 35:59.290
Big Bro!

35:59.290 --> 36:01.410
- What should we do? The fire i―
- Big Bro!

36:09.810 --> 36:11.260
Nezuko...

36:11.560 --> 36:12.510
Nezuko!

36:17.390 --> 36:18.390
My uniform...

36:18.730 --> 36:19.840
My Nichirin Sword...

36:20.560 --> 36:22.060
I'm waking up!

36:22.430 --> 36:23.670
Little by little.

36:24.060 --> 36:25.360
Little by little!

36:25.940 --> 36:27.240
Big Bro?

36:27.240 --> 36:29.410
Big Bro, are you all right?

36:29.410 --> 36:30.610
Big Bro?

36:31.740 --> 36:32.660
Sorry.

36:32.990 --> 36:34.360
I have to go.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.190
I have to hurry back!

36:42.960 --> 36:44.210
I'm sorry.

36:44.680 --> 36:45.620
Big Bro!

36:45.630 --> 36:47.370
- Big Bro!
- Big Bro!

36:53.710 --> 36:56.590
If the demon who's showing me
this dream is nearby...

36:57.340 --> 36:59.560
I have to find him and slash him right away!

37:01.360 --> 37:03.610
Where is he? I have to...

37:06.480 --> 37:08.140
Where are you going, Big Bro?

37:15.860 --> 37:19.040
I picked lots of vegetables today!

37:23.410 --> 37:25.210
Mom! This way!

37:25.490 --> 37:28.210
Big Bro was on fire all of a sudden!

37:31.080 --> 37:32.540
Mom?

37:32.880 --> 37:35.320
Tanjiro, are you all right?

37:36.010 --> 37:37.670
Big Bro...

37:44.390 --> 37:48.220
What's the matter, Tanjiro? Why are you dressed like that?

37:59.440 --> 38:01.270
I wish I could stay here...

38:01.610 --> 38:03.070
forever.

38:06.190 --> 38:08.460
I wish I could turn around and go back,

38:09.790 --> 38:13.960
By rights, I should've been living
like this forever.

38:14.790 --> 38:15.870
Right here.

38:17.840 --> 38:19.120
If none of this had happened...

38:19.960 --> 38:22.260
they'd'all have been alive and well now.

38:23.710 --> 38:28.640
And Nezuko would've lived in the sunlight,
under the blue sky.

38:31.480 --> 38:34.890
If none of this had happened...

38:35.980 --> 38:39.390
I should be here
making charcoal every day

38:40.440 --> 38:42.910
I never would've laid a hand on a sword!

38:46.240 --> 38:47.820
If none of this had happened...

38:49.630 --> 38:51.240
f none of this had happenedos

39:04.680 --> 39:07.560
But I've lost them now.

39:08.090 --> 39:09.760
I can never go back!

39:13.260 --> 39:14.670
Big Bro!

39:15.260 --> 39:17.690
Don't leave us behind!

39:24.030 --> 39:25.110
Sorry!

39:26.080 --> 39:27.740
I'm sorry, Rokuta!

39:29.530 --> 39:32.360
We can't be together anymore.

39:33.440 --> 39:37.840
But I'll always be thinking of you, okay?

39:38.710 --> 39:41.420
I'll be thinking of you all!

39:44.210 --> 39:47.290
There are lots of things to thank you for.

39:47.790 --> 39:50.770
Lots of things to be sorry for!

39:51.230 --> 39:53.160
But I will never forget you!

39:53.560 --> 39:56.890
No matter what, my heart will always be with you!

39:57.860 --> 39:58.890
So, please...

39:59.940 --> 40:01.390
forgive me!

40:08.380 --> 40:13.070
I have to destroy his spiritual core right away.

40:31.760 --> 40:34.810
Vol So, this is the inside of his heart?

40:36.840 --> 40:39.310
How can it be so beautiful?

40:39.840 --> 40:41.820
It's so endlessly vast...

40:42.330 --> 40:43.610
and...

40:44.860 --> 40:46.610
also warm.

40:56.740 --> 40:59.840
Where the heck is his spiritual core?

41:01.930 --> 41:05.870
What's with this realm of the subconscious?

41:07.460 --> 41:11.120
And that creepy naked boar...

41:11.460 --> 41:13.710
Seriously, this is insane.

41:20.030 --> 41:22.470
What are you doing
in the realm of the subconscious?

41:22.480 --> 41:25.140
You stupid naked boar!

41:36.160 --> 41:37.910
It's pitch-dark.

41:39.490 --> 41:43.660
It's pitch-dark, and I can't see a thing. Dammit.

41:43.660 --> 41:47.410
What's with that blond brat's
realm of subconscious?

41:47.880 --> 41:52.590
Do I have to grope around to find his spiritual core?

41:52.930 --> 41:54.670
You must be kidding me.

41:57.340 --> 41:58.390
What was that?

42:08.580 --> 42:12.610
What the hell's a guy doing in here?
Damn you, parasite!

42:12.940 --> 42:16.360
No one's allowed in here but Nezuko,

42:22.410 --> 42:23.770
Where's Nezuko?

42:24.110 --> 42:25.620
Wh-Who the heck knows?

42:25.630 --> 42:28.620
All right, then... Die!

42:31.840 --> 42:35.290
Nooo!

42:39.710 --> 42:41.620
They're having trouble, aren't they?

42:42.030 --> 42:43.520
I wonder why.

42:43.940 --> 42:47.640
They haven't destroyed any of the spiritual cores yet.

42:49.030 --> 42:49.890
Oh well...

42:50.480 --> 42:54.390
I guess it doesn't matter, since they're buying me some time.

42:58.540 --> 42:59.410
Not here.

42:59.740 --> 43:02.120
But I can smell a demon, even faintly.

43:02.740 --> 43:03.990
What's this, though?

43:04.330 --> 43:06.410
It's like there's a film over everything!

43:06.990 --> 43:10.160
There's a faint demon scent everywhere!

43:10.740 --> 43:12.410
I can't tell the exact location!

43:12.990 --> 43:14.460
I have to hurry!

43:14.990 --> 43:16.920
Nezuko's bleeding!

43:17.560 --> 43:21.170
If everyone else is asleep,
we're in big trouble!

43:21.760 --> 43:23.090
What should I do?

43:24.680 --> 43:28.060
Am I unable to use Total Concentration Breathing now?

43:29.060 --> 43:31.560
Am I just asleep right now?

43:33.030 --> 43:34.940
Tanjiro...

43:39.360 --> 43:41.160
Take up your sword.

43:42.780 --> 43:45.820
There's something you must cut.

43:56.290 --> 43:58.120
There's something...

43:59.340 --> 44:00.510
I must cut.

44:02.460 --> 44:04.090
There's something I must cut...

44:04.510 --> 44:06.120
in order to wake up.

44:07.810 --> 44:09.220
I think I know what it is.

44:10.360 --> 44:13.020
But what if I'm wrong?

44:13.780 --> 44:17.270
If what happens in this dream has an effect on reality, too...

44:17.810 --> 44:19.270
there'll be no going back.

44:22.190 --> 44:24.270
Don't hesitate! Do it!

44:24.640 --> 44:25.910
You have to do it!

44:26.160 --> 44:28.870
My death in this dream will lead me to reality!

44:29.210 --> 44:30.490
In other words...

44:31.830 --> 44:33.160
what I have to cut is...

44:36.160 --> 44:38.620
my own neck!

44:56.060 --> 44:58.760
I'm all right. I'm alive.

45:03.660 --> 45:05.320
Nezuko! Are you okay?

45:08.440 --> 45:09.860
Nezuko...

45:11.530 --> 45:12.940
Zenitsu...

45:13.440 --> 45:14.740
Inosuke...

45:15.240 --> 45:16.670
Rengoku...

45:20.710 --> 45:22.840
Who are these people?

45:23.430 --> 45:26.340
They're all connected by the wrists with ropes.

45:27.430 --> 45:29.020
Rope...

45:31.380 --> 45:32.670
What's this?

45:32.980 --> 45:34.390
It's burned off.

45:34.730 --> 45:36.860
Nezuko's burning blood did it?

45:37.440 --> 45:39.860
It's faint, but I'm picking up
a demon's scent, too!

45:41.940 --> 45:44.020
This smell... The ticket!

45:45.310 --> 45:49.060
I knew it. It's giving off a faint demon smell, too.

45:49.610 --> 45:52.160
We were put to sleep
when our tickets were punched.

45:52.910 --> 45:55.070
This must be a demon's work!

45:55.580 --> 46:00.620
Did he unleash such a potent Blood Demon Art
using just this faint scent?

46:03.160 --> 46:04.570
I don't know why...

46:05.130 --> 46:09.510
but I have a feeling that I shouldn't sever
this rope with my Nichirin Sword.

46:11.640 --> 46:13.310
Nezuko! Do me a favor!

46:13.890 --> 46:15.670
I want you to burn off everyone's rope!

46:23.480 --> 46:25.660
Zenitsu! Wake up!

46:25.910 --> 46:28.910
Wake up, Zenitsu! You have to wake up!

46:31.410 --> 46:33.770
Wake up, Inosuke! Please!

46:34.910 --> 46:36.020
Inosuke...

46:38.910 --> 46:41.270
There, there... Sorry, okay?

46:41.880 --> 46:42.920
Thanks.

46:43.210 --> 46:44.790
You did a great job, Nezuko.

46:48.210 --> 46:50.790
It's no good. These two don't wake up.

46:51.680 --> 46:53.040
What can I do?

46:56.040 --> 46:56.840
Rengoku

47:00.610 --> 47:01.470
What are you doing?

47:04.390 --> 47:07.470
Is a demon controlling her?

47:07.730 --> 47:09.270
Get out of our way!

47:09.610 --> 47:13.360
Thanks to you guys, we won't be able to have dreams!

47:15.890 --> 47:17.540
Is she acting of her own free will?

47:19.580 --> 47:20.910
This man, too?

47:24.410 --> 47:25.960
What do you think you're doing?

47:26.330 --> 47:28.820
If you're awake, you'd better help us out!

47:29.130 --> 47:32.890
You may have tuberculosis or whatever,
but if you don't do your job,

47:32.890 --> 47:37.090
I'm going to tell him, and then, he won't show you any dreams, you hear me?

47:40.010 --> 47:42.720
Is he the one who was connected to me?

47:43.260 --> 47:44.560
Tuberculosis...

47:44.930 --> 47:46.220
He's sick.

47:46.760 --> 47:48.220
Poor man.

47:49.260 --> 47:51.240
What this demon did is unforgivable.

47:51.740 --> 47:54.320
He took advantage of their weak souls!

47:56.490 --> 47:57.410
Sorry.

47:58.240 --> 48:00.910
I have to go fight.

48:22.930 --> 48:26.110
I wanted to stay inside my dream, too.

48:44.830 --> 48:46.490
I was willing...

48:46.490 --> 48:53.710
to hurt others if it meant I could escape from the pain of this illness.

48:55.290 --> 48:57.710
But it was warm...

48:58.310 --> 49:01.470
inside your dream and inside your soul.

49:03.010 --> 49:06.470
You must be the incarnations
of this boy's soul.

49:20.780 --> 49:24.240
Is that his spiritual core?

49:24.780 --> 49:26.240
Why are you showing it to me?

49:30.360 --> 49:34.370
Did you bring me here because I was searching for it?

49:40.090 --> 49:41.710
No way!

49:42.340 --> 49:45.040
Even though I was trying to destroy it?

49:45.840 --> 49:47.340
Why would you...

49:49.260 --> 49:55.390
The shining little sprites inside you lit up my heart.

49:57.890 --> 49:59.470
Are you all right?

50:02.030 --> 50:03.220
Thank you.

50:05.230 --> 50:06.610
Be careful.

50:10.580 --> 50:11.710
Right!

50:11.990 --> 50:13.120
Nezuko!

50:24.930 --> 50:26.920
The smell is overpowering!

50:27.260 --> 50:28.170
So heavy!

50:28.680 --> 50:32.170
The demon's scent is so strong
even in this strong wind!

50:32.840 --> 50:35.170
Was I asleep in such an awful scent?

50:36.340 --> 50:38.810
Even if each car was closed off and airtight,

50:39.140 --> 50:40.670
I can't believe I was!

50:41.310 --> 50:42.520
I was useless!

50:43.580 --> 50:44.910
The demon's upwind...

50:45.410 --> 50:46.690
Is he in the first car?

50:50.660 --> 50:51.820
Nezuko, don't come!

50:52.280 --> 50:53.820
Stay away from me and wait!

50:54.360 --> 50:55.990
Go wake everyone up!

51:04.010 --> 51:06.090
What? You're awake?

51:06.510 --> 51:07.920
Good morning!

51:08.260 --> 51:12.010
You could've stayed asleep.

51:13.040 --> 51:14.510
It was him!

51:15.760 --> 51:17.440
Why did you wake up?

51:18.480 --> 51:22.440
Didn't I show you a sweet dream?

51:22.780 --> 51:28.440
I could've shown you a dream where your family was being slaughtered.

51:28.730 --> 51:31.220
Would you have liked that one better?

51:31.230 --> 51:33.870
No, of course not. Too distressing, right?

51:37.080 --> 51:38.660
All right, next...

51:39.240 --> 51:42.910
Why don't I show you a dream where your father comes back to life?

51:52.840 --> 51:54.170
What I really love..,

51:54.730 --> 52:01.170
is to show people nightmares right after a happy dream.

52:06.780 --> 52:08.690
I get such a kick out of that!

52:09.240 --> 52:17.940
How enthralling is it to gaze at someone shattered by misfortune, suffering and flailing?

52:18.740 --> 52:21.440
But I don't usually let my guard down.

52:21.780 --> 52:26.460
So, it may take longer, but I'll make sure to kill Demon Slayers,

52:27.090 --> 52:29.670
I mixed my blood with the ink on the tickets.

52:30.010 --> 52:36.210
Once the conductor punches them,
creating clamp marks...

52:37.260 --> 52:39.510
the spell activates,

52:42.890 --> 52:44.310
And yet...

52:45.190 --> 52:48.360
how did this one manage to wake up?

52:48.860 --> 52:52.220
And he found the way to wake up in a short time.

52:52.890 --> 52:59.660
Even though the human desire for blissful dreams,
for self-serving dreams...

53:01.080 --> 53:04.290
is so enormous!

53:06.410 --> 53:09.490
Don't you dare intrude on my soul!

53:10.160 --> 53:12.160
I won't let you...

53:12.580 --> 53:13.960
get away with this!

53:23.340 --> 53:25.170
How lucky is that?

53:25.510 --> 53:28.720
So, he came right to me!

53:29.230 --> 53:31.420
This is like a dream!

53:31.430 --> 53:35.990
Now I can receive even more blood of Master Muzan!

53:36.610 --> 53:40.110
And once I become more powerful,

53:40.110 --> 53:44.990
I'll challenge an Upper Rank demon
to a duel to replace him!

53:47.610 --> 53:49.290
Water Breathing...

53:50.630 --> 53:51.960
Tenth Form...

53:52.510 --> 53:54.460
Constant Flux!

53:59.430 --> 54:00.670
Blood Demon Art!

54:03.540 --> 54:07.440
Whispers of Forced Unconscious Hypnosis.

54:07.940 --> 54:11.440
Go to sleep!

54:20.230 --> 54:21.470
He's not falling asleep.

54:27.210 --> 54:28.120
Go to sleep.

54:35.710 --> 54:36.620
Go to sleep.

54:39.710 --> 54:42.010
Go to sleep!

54:45.760 --> 54:51.470
Go... to... sleep!

54:53.010 --> 54:54.760
It's not working. But why not?

54:58.160 --> 55:01.820
He's falling under this spell over and over!

55:08.530 --> 55:11.740
He's aware that he's under the spell right away.

55:23.710 --> 55:27.510
Even if it's in the middle of a dream,
to commit suicide...

55:27.510 --> 55:30.370
to take his own life with his own hands...

55:30.930 --> 55:33.140
that takes incredible willpower!

55:33.560 --> 55:35.060
This brat...

55:37.530 --> 55:38.970
is insane!

55:47.940 --> 55:52.460
Why didn't you save us?

55:56.460 --> 56:00.320
What were you doing while we were being murdered?

56:02.880 --> 56:07.090
How could you be the only one to survive?

56:14.760 --> 56:17.670
Why do you think you were here?

56:18.010 --> 56:20.090
You're so useless!

56:28.030 --> 56:30.820
It should've been you that died.

56:31.660 --> 56:35.190
How dare you go on living
without a care.

56:42.540 --> 56:46.960
There's no way they'd ever say that!
Not ever! Not my family!

56:47.540 --> 56:49.340
Don't you dare...

56:49.960 --> 56:51.290
insult...

56:51.290 --> 56:54.420
my family!

57:19.240 --> 57:21.120
It was way too easy.

57:22.540 --> 57:24.710
Could this be a dream, too?

57:25.130 --> 57:29.070
Or was this demon weaker than him?

57:30.160 --> 57:32.070
I can totally see why...

57:32.680 --> 57:37.670
he ordered me to kill you, the boy with the earrings,

57:39.230 --> 57:41.840
along with the Hashira!

57:42.510 --> 57:45.340
Your very existence is, like...

57:45.840 --> 57:49.670
It couldn't be more irritating, you know!

57:50.240 --> 57:51.440
He's not dying?

57:51.990 --> 57:54.610
Oh, that look on your face is so delightful!

57:54.940 --> 57:58.020
That's the look I've been wanting to see!

57:59.690 --> 58:04.770
You want to know why I'm not dead after you decapitated me, don't you?

58:05.290 --> 58:09.370
Fine, since I'm feeling so ecstatic right now.

58:09.960 --> 58:13.840
It's so easy even an infant would understand.

58:16.010 --> 58:19.870
It's because the body over there was no longer my main body.

58:20.460 --> 58:23.370
Same with this thing that's talking to you now.

58:23.730 --> 58:27.390
It merely looks like my head, but it's not.

58:27.810 --> 58:30.890
While you were snoozing away...

58:31.560 --> 58:34.770
I fused with this train!

58:36.190 --> 58:42.910
Every inch of this train has become my blood, my flesh and my bones!

58:43.960 --> 58:45.460
Look at your face.

58:45.790 --> 58:48.660
Are you getting it now?
In other words...

58:49.460 --> 58:52.790
the more than 200 passengers
on this train...

58:52.790 --> 58:56.710
are the food that will strengthen
my body even more...

58:57.160 --> 58:59.170
as well as my hostages.

58:59.760 --> 59:03.720
So, do you think you can protect them by yourself?

59:03.730 --> 59:09.920
All these people packing this train
from one end to another...

59:21.080 --> 59:23.240
What should I do? What should I do?

59:23.780 --> 59:26.940
The most I can protect on my own is two cars!

59:26.940 --> 59:29.660
Any more than that, and I can't guarantee their safety!

59:30.410 --> 59:33.870
Rengoku! Zenitsu! Inosuke!

59:34.460 --> 59:38.510
This is no time to be sleeping! Wake up, will you? Please!

59:39.040 --> 59:40.420
Nezuko!

59:40.760 --> 59:43.260
Protect the sleeping passengers!

59:54.940 --> 59:56.890
Follow me, damn minions!

59:57.230 --> 59:58.220
All right!

59:58.780 --> 01:00:00.440
Explosive Awakening!

01:00:01.560 --> 01:00:03.640
Comin' through!

01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:07.410
Lord Inosuke's comin' through!

01:00:07.410 --> 01:00:08.660
Inosuke!

01:00:08.990 --> 01:00:11.160
It's not safe anywhere on this train anymore!

01:00:11.410 --> 01:00:13.410
We have to protect the sleeping passengers!

01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:16.160
This whole train's turned into a demon!

01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:19.410
Can you hear me? This whole train is a demon!

01:00:21.330 --> 01:00:24.970
I knew it! So, I was right on the money!

01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:28.970
That means I was a total stud as a leader!

01:00:33.340 --> 01:00:36.220
Beast Breathing, Fifth Fang...

01:00:36.980 --> 01:00:38.720
Crazy Cutting!

01:00:43.530 --> 01:00:46.740
I'll save every last one of you guys!

01:00:46.740 --> 01:00:48.800
{\an8}Fall onto your knees...

01:00:49.160 --> 01:00:50.990
and worship me!

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.990
Glorify me!

01:00:53.330 --> 01:00:58.320
Lord Inosuke Hashibira is comin' through!

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:01.090
I have to go save the passengers!

01:01:01.630 --> 01:01:05.170
If Inosuke can hold down the fort here,
I should go on ahead!

01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:32.690
It's gone this far already?

01:01:35.710 --> 01:01:36.960
Water Breathing...

01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:38.820
First Form...

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.120
Water Surface Slash!

01:01:43.660 --> 01:01:44.660
No good.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.990
This is never going to end!

01:01:47.290 --> 01:01:49.320
How am I supposed to fend it off?

01:01:55.890 --> 01:02:01.340
Damn Demon Slayer, scurrying around inside me.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:05.170
You can cut all you want, but I'll just keep regenerating.

01:02:05.180 --> 01:02:09.270
And then, after all your strength is depleted...

01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:28.640
Thunder Breathing...

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:30.760
First Form...

01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.860
Thunderclap and Flash!

01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:38.110
Sixfold.

01:03:38.690 --> 01:03:39.860
I'll protect you...

01:03:40.690 --> 01:03:42.110
Nezuko!

01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:46.360
Protect...

01:03:53.210 --> 01:03:54.790
That sounded like thunder,

01:03:55.260 --> 01:03:56.620
From one of the cars in the back?

01:03:56.630 --> 01:03:58.590
What's going on?

01:03:58.590 --> 01:04:00.460
Is Zenitsu awake now?

01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.420
What about Rengoku?

01:04:02.430 --> 01:04:03.710
And Nezuko?

01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:12.390
I cannot do anything but protect the people here!

01:04:13.110 --> 01:04:14.720
This is bad! What should I do?

01:04:14.730 --> 01:04:16.360
We can't fight in coordination!

01:04:16.690 --> 01:04:19.610
Are the passengers in the back all right?

01:04:20.060 --> 01:04:21.020
Damn!

01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:22.890
It's so cramped!

01:04:23.690 --> 01:04:25.710
And so hard to swing my sword!

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:36.210
To think that all of this happened
while I was dozing...

01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:38.790
How could this be?

01:04:39.330 --> 01:04:41.720
I'm ashamed as a Hashira.

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:44.560
If only I could crawl...

01:04:46.810 --> 01:04:48.220
under a rock!

01:04:55.260 --> 01:04:56.390
What happened?

01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:03.940
What was that?

01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:05.570
A demon attack?

01:05:07.860 --> 01:05:09.360
Young Kamado!

01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:12.360
Rengoku!

01:05:12.690 --> 01:05:16.090
I was pretty thorough
with my slashing attacks on my way here,

01:05:16.090 --> 01:05:18.710
so it should take the demon
a while to regenerate.

01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:21.290
But there's no time to lose!
I'll keep it short!

01:05:21.290 --> 01:05:22.210
Okay!

01:05:22.590 --> 01:05:24.460
This train has eight cars in all.

01:05:24.790 --> 01:05:26.710
I'll protect the five in the rear.

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:30.960
The yellow boy and your sister will be in charge of the rest.

01:05:31.290 --> 01:05:32.860
You and the boar head boy...

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:36.770
will go look for the demon's head while keeping an eye on those three cars.

01:05:37.110 --> 01:05:38.060
Head?

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:39.520
But this demon is

01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:43.310
No matter what form he's assumed, so long as he's a demon, he's got a head!

01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:45.720
I'll be searching for his weak spot as I fight!

01:05:45.980 --> 01:05:47.860
I want you to show me how gutsy you are!

01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:53.910
Amazing! I can't even see him!

01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:57.290
Did the train shake earlier because Rengoku was on the move?

01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:00.790
He's so quick to read the situation
and make decisions!

01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:03.040
Five cars, all by himself?

01:06:04.290 --> 01:06:08.140
This is no time to be dazzled, idiot!
Do what you have to do!

01:06:08.390 --> 01:06:12.010
The demon's scent is getting stronger
by the second! Hurry!

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:16.260
Inosuke! Where are you, Inosuke?

01:06:19.640 --> 01:06:22.390
That guy with the goggle eyes
ordered me around!

01:06:24.410 --> 01:06:25.520
But somehow...

01:06:25.910 --> 01:06:27.520
Somehow...

01:06:28.410 --> 01:06:30.270
Somehow, he was awesome!

01:06:30.610 --> 01:06:33.110
I'm so pissed!

01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:36.740
Inosuke! Keep an eye on the three cars in the front!

01:06:36.990 --> 01:06:38.570
You don't have to tell me!

01:06:38.830 --> 01:06:42.010
And by the way, I've found it! Already!

01:06:42.010 --> 01:06:44.010
With my all-out Seventh Form...

01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.120
I found this master's weak spot!

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:49.540
You did? So, it's in the front, after all?

01:06:49.540 --> 01:06:51.040
That's right, up front!

01:06:51.040 --> 01:06:53.870
And that front part is a heck of a lot creepier!

01:06:54.430 --> 01:06:57.870
The scent got swept away because the wind
is so strong, making it hard to detect,

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:00.220
but if Inosuke says so,
there's no doubt about it!

01:07:00.560 --> 01:07:02.770
So, it's around
where the coal's loaded, right?

01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:03.810
That's right!

01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:04.720
Understood!

01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.860
Okay, let's go!

01:07:07.110 --> 01:07:08.360
Forward!

01:07:20.410 --> 01:07:21.870
This is it, huh?

01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:27.210
All right!

01:07:34.590 --> 01:07:35.670
Inosuke!

01:07:36.310 --> 01:07:38.920
Fishy, very fishy!

01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:41.310
Especially around here!

01:07:41.310 --> 01:07:42.670
Who the hell are you?

01:07:42.930 --> 01:07:44.670
G-Get out of here!

01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:46.670
The demon's head...

01:07:47.010 --> 01:07:48.170
The demon's...

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:49.940
weak spot!

01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:56.070
Gross!

01:07:56.490 --> 01:07:58.410
Get away from me! Shoo! Shoo!

01:08:00.690 --> 01:08:02.320
That's way too many hands!

01:08:02.910 --> 01:08:03.860
Uh-oh!

01:08:06.830 --> 01:08:09.620
Water Breathing, Sixth Form...

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.120
Whirlpool!

01:08:19.130 --> 01:08:20.760
Inosuke, are you all right?

01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:23.260
It's not like you came to my rescue, okay?

01:08:23.260 --> 01:08:24.270
Yeah, I know!

01:08:27.109 --> 01:08:28.220
It's here...

01:08:29.390 --> 01:08:30.689
It's right beneath!

01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:32.859
Directly below this place.

01:08:32.859 --> 01:08:34.609
The demon's scent is powerful!

01:08:42.130 --> 01:08:43.240
Just watch.

01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:46.370
Beast Breathing, Second Fang...

01:08:47.740 --> 01:08:49.490
Slice!

01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:56.990
It's the bone.

01:08:57.410 --> 01:08:58.890
His neck bone!

01:08:59.680 --> 01:09:02.340
Water Breathing, Eighth Form...

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:03.670
Waterfall Basin!

01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:09.510
It blocked it!

01:09:25.609 --> 01:09:27.240
The gash is closing up!

01:09:27.779 --> 01:09:29.520
It's regenerating so fast!

01:09:29.830 --> 01:09:34.210
Not only that, but it took everything I had
just to expose the bone!

01:09:34.540 --> 01:09:36.290
I have to sever it!

01:09:36.790 --> 01:09:40.120
Inosuke! We're going to synchronize
our breathing and attack together!

01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:44.870
One of us will slash the flesh
while the other jumps in to sever the bone!

01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:47.590
Sounds good! Great idea!

01:09:47.859 --> 01:09:49.120
I can praise you for that!

01:09:49.130 --> 01:09:50.270
Thanks!

01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:53.189
Let's go!

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.560
DREAM

01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:05.310
Eyes of Forced Unconscious Sleep.

01:10:05.610 --> 01:10:06.820
A Blood Demon Art!

01:10:07.790 --> 01:10:10.490
He got me! He's putting me to sleep!

01:10:11.490 --> 01:10:14.870
Inosuke! Slash your own neck
in your dreams!

01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.240
Then, you'll wake up!

01:10:21.040 --> 01:10:22.070
It's all right!

01:10:22.410 --> 01:10:24.470
Even if I fall under it,
I can break the spell!

01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:30.470
Idiot! When you wake up, close your eyes! 
Or else you'll fall under the spell right away!

01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:33.680
{\an8}Okay, I'm awake!

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:44.190
Damn! Even though I'm awake, I can't avoid looking at the eyes!

01:10:44.490 --> 01:10:47.020
I have to wake up with my eyes shut!

01:10:47.030 --> 01:10:48.820
With my eyes shut!

01:10:50.830 --> 01:10:51.610
No good!

01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:52.940
Wake up!

01:10:53.330 --> 01:10:54.690
Wake up!

01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:55.690
Hurry!

01:10:56.110 --> 01:10:57.190
Cut the neck!

01:10:57.580 --> 01:10:59.210
Cut it! Cut it!

01:10:59.930 --> 01:11:01.290
I have to wake up!

01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:04.460
Hurry!

01:11:11.180 --> 01:11:13.120
This isn't a dream! It's reality!

01:11:13.510 --> 01:11:15.360
Don't fall for his trap!

01:11:15.690 --> 01:11:17.890
Don't die such lame deaths!

01:11:22.230 --> 01:11:25.390
I'm wearing the hide of the mountain god on my head.

01:11:25.730 --> 01:11:28.560
I bet he's too scared to look me in the eye!

01:11:29.860 --> 01:11:31.690
You loser eyeballs!

01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:36.740
I see. He's having a hard time telling which way Inosuke's looking!

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:40.820
All right, now all we gotta do is slash this thing to death!

01:11:45.290 --> 01:11:46.240
Inosuke!

01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:49.640
Don't you dare get in the way of my dream!

01:11:56.680 --> 01:11:58.170
Did you get stabbed?

01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:59.560
I'm okay.

01:12:01.810 --> 01:12:04.010
Just forget about that bastard!

01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:06.510
I can't do that! I won't let him die!

01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:11.360
If we don't chop this demon's head off soon,
we won't be able to make it!

01:12:11.690 --> 01:12:13.820
I know! Let's get moving!

01:12:31.130 --> 01:12:32.010
Inosuke!

01:12:32.630 --> 01:12:34.170
Synchronize your breathing with mine!

01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:36.040
And let's chop off the demon's head!

01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:37.920
Let's attack together!

01:13:13.490 --> 01:13:15.890
No good! If I fall asleep now...

01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:17.390
Damn you!

01:13:17.730 --> 01:13:19.890
C'mon! Follow me!

01:13:20.230 --> 01:13:22.890
Beast Breathing, Fourth Fang...

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:27.590
Slice 'n' Dice!

01:13:31.490 --> 01:13:33.940
Father, please protect me!

01:13:34.490 --> 01:13:37.520
I'm going to sever that bone...

01:13:38.440 --> 01:13:39.570
with this blow!

01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:41.690
Hinokami Kagura...

01:13:43.580 --> 01:13:45.360
Clear Blue Sky!

01:14:10.390 --> 01:14:11.810
Are you okay, Inosuke?

01:14:12.030 --> 01:14:14.720
H-Hey, is your belly okay?

01:14:14.730 --> 01:14:16.060
Y-Yeah!

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:18.690
Inosuke, protect the passen

01:14:20.610 --> 01:14:21.770
I can't die.

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:26.320
If I die, that'll make him a murderer!

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:27.740
I can't die!

01:14:30.630 --> 01:14:32.540
I don't want to let anyone die!

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:01.740
Are you okay, Santaro?

01:15:03.860 --> 01:15:05.740
Hang in there!

01:15:05.740 --> 01:15:08.690
I was lucky I could bounce off the demon's flesh!

01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:10.610
Cool, huh?

01:15:10.940 --> 01:15:12.520
Is your belly okay?

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:14.570
Your belly that got stabbed!

01:15:14.930 --> 01:15:15.920
I'm...

01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:17.870
all right.

01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:19.620
What about you?

01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:23.040
Never felt better! I didn't even catch a cold!

01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:26.620
I won't be able to move for a while.

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:30.540
Help the others, will you?

01:15:31.890 --> 01:15:33.970
Was anyone injured?

01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:38.610
What about the engineer near the head?

01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:43.110
It's okay if that bastard dies!

01:15:43.690 --> 01:15:45.560
It's not okay.

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:48.190
He's the one who stabbed you
in the belly, remember?

01:15:48.190 --> 01:15:51.620
He's got his leg stuck and can't move!

01:15:51.910 --> 01:15:54.320
His leg's shattered, and he can't walk anymore!

01:15:54.330 --> 01:15:55.790
Just leave him there, and he'll die!

01:15:56.210 --> 01:15:59.910
Then, he's already atoned for his sin.

01:16:00.410 --> 01:16:02.370
Help him, will you?

01:16:04.410 --> 01:16:05.620
Please.

01:16:13.090 --> 01:16:14.560
I'll go for you, then!

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:16.220
Because I'm the boss!

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:18.470
Because my minion asked me to!

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:22.890
After I rescue him, I'm going to pluck out all of that guy's hair!

01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:26.820
That's really not necessary.

01:16:31.280 --> 01:16:33.410
It's almost dawn.

01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:36.820
Get your breathing under control.

01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:39.070
We have to...

01:16:39.690 --> 01:16:41.090
save the injured...

01:16:41.710 --> 01:16:43.210
before it's too late.

01:17:01.980 --> 01:17:03.940
My body's disintegrating.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.060
I can't regenerate,

01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:10.140
Did I lose? Am I going to die?

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:11.320
Me?

01:17:11.980 --> 01:17:12.940
Ridiculous.

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:16.960
Ridiculous! I haven't been able to go all out!

01:17:17.410 --> 01:17:20.460
I couldn't devour a single human!

01:17:20.460 --> 01:17:25.960
My plan to fuse with the train and devour humans en masse just went up in smoke!

01:17:26.210 --> 01:17:28.960
And now, look what I've been reduced to!

01:17:29.210 --> 01:17:32.510
After all the time and trouble I've taken!

01:17:33.060 --> 01:17:34.470
It was him!

01:17:34.730 --> 01:17:36.590
It's all his fault!

01:17:36.980 --> 01:17:42.420
Even though I'd taken 200 humans hostage, still I struggled!

01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:43.890
I was held at bay!

01:17:44.310 --> 01:17:46.720
Is this the power of a Hashira?

01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:50.070
And him... He was fast, too.

01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:53.520
Even though he never broke
the spell completely!

01:17:53.530 --> 01:17:58.070
Not to mention that girl! She's a demon! What's that about?

01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:00.440
A demon, joining forces with Demon Slayers?

01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:03.740
Why hasn't Master Muzan killed the traitor?

01:18:05.110 --> 01:18:07.760
Dammit! Dammit!

01:18:08.180 --> 01:18:09.540
In the first place...

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:14.290
it all started going downhill once that brat broke my spell!

01:18:14.630 --> 01:18:17.040
That brat is to blame!

01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:20.870
I wish I could at least kill that brat! Somehow!

01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:23.790
That's right, and that boar, too!

01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:27.640
I could've at least killed that brat!

01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:31.860
But that boar thwarted me. His intuition is extraordinary,

01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:34.060
He could sense my gaze!

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:37.140
Am I going to lose?

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:39.440
Am I going to die?

01:18:40.060 --> 01:18:44.820
Oh, what a nightmare!
What a nightmare!

01:18:46.210 --> 01:18:50.820
It's always the bottom-feeder demons who get killed by the Demon Slayers.

01:18:51.240 --> 01:18:52.490
In the Upper Ranks...

01:18:52.490 --> 01:18:56.210
the same demons have remained
for the last few centuries.

01:18:56.210 --> 01:19:01.170
They're strong enough to defeat Hashira who've killed an untold number of demons.

01:19:01.510 --> 01:19:04.170
Do they have otherworldly powers?

01:19:04.930 --> 01:19:10.060
Even after receiving so much of his blood,
I couldn't reach the Upper Ranks!

01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:15.240
I want to do it over! I want to do it over!

01:19:15.240 --> 01:19:20.910
What a miserable nightmare this is...

01:19:28.190 --> 01:19:30.740
I see you've mastered
Total Concentration, Constant.

01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:32.710
Impressive!

01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:35.370
Rengoku...

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:38.840
After all, Constant is the first step
toward becoming a Hashira.

01:19:39.090 --> 01:19:42.210
Although, there might be 10,000 steps
before you can become a Hashira.

01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:44.870
I'll do my best.

01:19:45.930 --> 01:19:47.760
You're bleeding from the abdomen.

01:19:48.340 --> 01:19:51.560
You have to concentrate harder
and improve the precision of your breathing.

01:19:51.890 --> 01:19:55.060
Make your nerves reach
every corner of your body.

01:19:55.780 --> 01:19:57.060
There's a blood vessel.

01:19:57.480 --> 01:19:59.110
A torn blood vessel.

01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:04.440
Concentrate harder!

01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:26.170
Focus!

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:38.170
Great! Looks like you stopped it.

01:20:38.430 --> 01:20:42.110
You'll be able to do all kinds of things
when you master breathing.

01:20:42.780 --> 01:20:44.770
Not that you'll be able to do everything,

01:20:45.190 --> 01:20:49.190
but you'll become a stronger version of yourself than yesterday for sure.

01:20:50.580 --> 01:20:51.940
Right.

01:20:53.830 --> 01:20:55.090
Everyone's safe!

01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:58.290
There are hordes of injured people,
but no one's life is in danger.

01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:03.120
Don't strain yourself. Take it easy and rest up.

01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:09.040
Thank you very much.

01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:41.320
Upper... Three?

01:21:42.040 --> 01:21:44.040
What's he doing here and now?

01:21:57.010 --> 01:21:58.970
Flame Breathing, Second Form...

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:02.890
Rising Scorching Sun!

01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:14.740
That's a fine sword.

01:22:16.940 --> 01:22:18.520
He sure can regenerate fast.

01:22:18.910 --> 01:22:21.240
This heavy and overwhelming demon aura...

01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:22.990
So, this is an Upper Rank,

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:27.540
I can't understand why you'd go after a wounded person first.

01:22:28.630 --> 01:22:32.870
He could get in the way of the chitchat... of you and me.

01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:35.460
What would you and I have to talk about?

01:22:35.790 --> 01:22:39.870
I'm meeting you now for the first time,
but I already dislike you.

01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:44.270
Is that right? Well, I loathe weak humans, too.

01:22:44.610 --> 01:22:47.220
The sight of a weakling makes my skin crawl.

01:22:47.780 --> 01:22:51.810
Then, it looks like our senses of value
are completely different.

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:56.060
All right, then I have a brilliant proposal for you.

01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:58.910
Why don't you become a demon, too?

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.410
I will not.

01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:04.240
I can tell your strength at a glance,

01:23:04.240 --> 01:23:05.870
You're a Hashira, aren't you?

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:08.660
Your fighting spirit has been honed to the hilt.

01:23:08.990 --> 01:23:11.320
It's close to the realm of the highest.

01:23:11.710 --> 01:23:15.510
I'm the Flame Hashira, Kyojuro Rengoku.

01:23:16.060 --> 01:23:17.970
I'm Akaza.

01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:19.310
Kyojuro...

01:23:19.760 --> 01:23:24.470
Let me tell you why you can't enter
the realm of the highest.

01:23:24.810 --> 01:23:26.310
Because you're a human.

01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:29.590
Because you're going to grow old.
Because you're going to die.

01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:33.740
Become a demon, Kyojuro.

01:23:34.580 --> 01:23:39.160
Do that, and you can go on training for a hundred, for two hundred years.

01:23:39.160 --> 01:23:40.740
You can become stronger.

01:23:42.330 --> 01:23:47.240
of all the demons that I've met until now, he has the strongest scent of Kibutsuji!

01:23:47.580 --> 01:23:49.510
I have to help him fight!

01:23:50.540 --> 01:23:56.960
Both growing old and dying are part of the beauty
of being an ephemeral creature like a human.

01:23:57.260 --> 01:24:00.510
The fact that we grow old and die

01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:04.010
is what makes human life so unbearably precious and noble.

01:24:05.290 --> 01:24:10.110
"Strength" isn't a word used to describe just the body.

01:24:14.190 --> 01:24:16.270
This boy isn't weak!

01:24:17.730 --> 01:24:19.390
Don't insult him.

01:24:19.690 --> 01:24:21.440
I'll repeat it as many times as it takes.

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:24.710
You and I have different senses of value.

01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:29.290
No matter what the reason, I will not become a demon!

01:24:34.130 --> 01:24:35.790
I see.

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.570
Technique Development...

01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:43.640
Destructive Death: Compass Needle!

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:17.870
I can't follow their movements!

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:21.790
There were never any Flames among all the Hashira I've killed until now.

01:25:22.510 --> 01:25:25.540
And no one ever took me up
on my offer, either.

01:25:30.030 --> 01:25:31.870
Why do you think that is?

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:36.190
As a fellow martial artist,
I just don't get it.

01:25:36.780 --> 01:25:40.110
Not when only the chosen ones
can become demons!

01:25:45.230 --> 01:25:49.490
Watching the hideous decline of someone
blessed with extraordinary powers...

01:25:49.490 --> 01:25:51.820
It pains me! I can't bear it!

01:25:52.630 --> 01:25:54.570
Die, Kyojuro...

01:25:54.830 --> 01:25:56.660
while you're still young and strong.

01:25:59.330 --> 01:26:00.570
Destructive Death..

01:26:01.830 --> 01:26:03.160
Air Type!

01:26:16.480 --> 01:26:17.420
I see.

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.470
Flame Breathing...

01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:22.970
Fourth Form...

01:26:22.980 --> 01:26:25.070
Blooming Flame Undulation!

01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:30.410
When he strikes the air with his fist,
the attack will reach me here!

01:26:33.660 --> 01:26:35.940
He can move faster than the blink of an eye.

01:26:41.960 --> 01:26:46.840
If I allow him to fight from a distance like this,
slicing his head off will be tricky.

01:26:46.840 --> 01:26:48.090
In that case...

01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:54.790
I'll just have to get up close!

01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:58.440
This superb reaction speed of yours...

01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:04.390
and these breathtaking sword skills
will be lost, too...

01:27:04.690 --> 01:27:05.970
Kyojuro!

01:27:05.980 --> 01:27:07.470
Doesn't that make you sad?

01:27:07.730 --> 01:27:08.890
It happens to everyone!

01:27:09.190 --> 01:27:11.360
It's a fact of life for any human!

01:27:12.940 --> 01:27:14.360
Stay where you are!

01:27:14.630 --> 01:27:16.660
If that wound reopens, it'll be fatal!

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:18.240
Stand back! That's an order!

01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:21.620
Don't bother with that weakling, Kyojuro!

01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:23.490
Come on, give me your best shot!

01:27:26.830 --> 01:27:28.490
Concentrate on me.

01:27:40.810 --> 01:27:42.260
Nice moves!

01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:49.740
Rengoku!

01:27:49.740 --> 01:27:51.110
Ol' Goggle-eyes!

01:27:54.660 --> 01:27:57.360
Turn into a demon, Kyojuro.

01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:05.490
Fight me forever and get stronger together with me.

01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:11.840
You have what it takes to do that!

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:15.090
I'll pass!

01:28:15.430 --> 01:28:18.790
Let me repeat it. I don't like you!

01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:24.560
I will not become a demon!

01:28:29.890 --> 01:28:31.470
Blazing Universe!

01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:36.390
Magnificent! That's sensational!

01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:39.440
Destructive Death..

01:28:39.440 --> 01:28:40.540
Air Type!

01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:50.490
There's no opening.

01:28:50.830 --> 01:28:51.990
I can't jump in.

01:28:52.330 --> 01:28:54.870
I can't keep up with the speed of their movements!

01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:57.640
Those two are in a different dimension!

01:28:57.890 --> 01:29:02.010
Getting between them would only mean death!
I can feel it in my bones!

01:29:02.340 --> 01:29:04.010
I can't move...

01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:07.920
because I know that even if I jumped in
to back him up, I'd only be a hindrance to him!

01:29:10.760 --> 01:29:12.390
Rengoku...

01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:18.440
You still don't get it?

01:29:18.780 --> 01:29:24.110
That if you continue attacking, you're just getting closer to death, Kyojuro?

01:29:33.590 --> 01:29:35.170
Flame Breathing, First Form...

01:29:35.430 --> 01:29:36.460
Unknowing Fire!

01:29:38.930 --> 01:29:41.090
It would be a shame to kill you now!

01:29:41.460 --> 01:29:43.790
You haven't reached your physical peak yet!

01:29:49.780 --> 01:29:50.770
Second Form...

01:29:52.110 --> 01:29:53.810
Rising Scorching Sun!

01:30:12.290 --> 01:30:13.490
Third Form...

01:30:13.740 --> 01:30:15.210
Blazing Universe!

01:30:16.630 --> 01:30:17.710
Fourth Form...

01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:20.040
Blooming Flame Undulation!

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:24.170
Destructive Death..

01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:26.760
Fifth Form...

01:30:27.480 --> 01:30:28.470
Flame Tiger!

01:30:31.980 --> 01:30:33.560
Disorder!

01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:39.170
Kyojuro!

01:30:55.860 --> 01:30:58.290
Did he do it? Did he win?

01:31:27.030 --> 01:31:28.360
Don't tell me...

01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:36.410
No way!

01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:46.410
Let's fight more.

01:31:47.210 --> 01:31:49.590
Don't die on me, Kyojuro.

01:32:07.910 --> 01:32:09.360
Rengoku!

01:32:11.740 --> 01:32:13.270
Rengoku!

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:24.510
Even if you fight to death,
you can't win, Kyojuro.

01:32:25.630 --> 01:32:31.960
Those impressive slashes you inflicted on me
have already healed completely.

01:32:32.210 --> 01:32:34.290
But what about you?

01:32:34.290 --> 01:32:39.260
A smashed left eye, shattered ribs and damaged internal organs...

01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:41.470
All irreparable.

01:32:41.780 --> 01:32:44.610
If you were a demon, you'd heal in a blink of an eye.

01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:48.360
Those would be mere scratches
for a demon.

01:32:48.610 --> 01:32:52.560
You can struggle all you want, but a human can never beat a demon.

01:32:54.980 --> 01:32:57.060
I want to go help him!

01:32:59.790 --> 01:33:02.240
But there's no strength in my arms or legs.

01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:04.660
It's partly because of my injury,

01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:07.710
but this always happens after I use
the Hinokami Kagura technique!

01:33:21.230 --> 01:33:23.420
Kyojuro, why...

01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:30.420
I will fulfill my duty!

01:33:30.680 --> 01:33:34.070
I will not allow anyone here to die!

01:33:35.560 --> 01:33:38.910
I'll damage his body as much as I can in an instant!

01:33:39.160 --> 01:33:40.320
Flame Breathing...

01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:50.510
What a tremendous fighting spirit!

01:33:50.510 --> 01:33:53.420
Amazing aura despite all those injuries!

01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:55.420
That mental strength!

01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:58.420
That airtight stance!

01:34:00.790 --> 01:34:04.420
You have to become a demon, after all, Kyojuro!

01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:07.690
Let's fight each other for all eternity!

01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:09.520
Set your heart ablaze.

01:34:10.530 --> 01:34:12.270
Go beyond your limits!

01:34:18.230 --> 01:34:19.440
Ninth Form...

01:34:20.190 --> 01:34:21.890
Rengoku!

01:34:22.140 --> 01:34:23.410
Destructive Death..

01:34:23.710 --> 01:34:25.040
Annihilation Type!

01:34:42.090 --> 01:34:43.420
Rengoku!

01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:17.840
Rengoku!

01:35:23.090 --> 01:35:24.590
Rengoku!

01:35:27.040 --> 01:35:28.260
I see hi

01:35:28.510 --> 01:35:29.340
Ren...

01:35:29.680 --> 01:35:30.710
goku...

01:35:45.140 --> 01:35:46.690
Become a demon!

01:35:46.690 --> 01:35:48.690
Say that you'll become a demon!

01:35:48.690 --> 01:35:49.960
You are...

01:35:50.330 --> 01:35:53.320
strong and one of the chosen ones!

01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:07.470
Kyojuro...

01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:09.220
Yes, Mother?

01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:12.260
I want you to think hard...

01:36:12.590 --> 01:36:14.890
1 about what I'm about to ask you.

01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:20.840
Do you know why you were born
stronger than others?

01:36:24.830 --> 01:36:26.110
I don't know!

01:36:26.860 --> 01:36:29.610
So that you can save weaker people.

01:36:31.080 --> 01:36:36.190
Those who were born blessed with more gifts than others

01:36:36.190 --> 01:36:42.120
are obligated to use those gifts for the world and other people.

01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:50.870
You must never use that God-given strength
to hurt others or for personal gain.

01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:57.090
It is the duty of those born strong
to help the weak.

01:36:57.810 --> 01:37:02.110
It is a mission they must fulfill responsibly.

01:37:02.690 --> 01:37:06.610
Make sure you never forget that.

01:37:06.610 --> 01:37:08.140
I won't!

01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:28.710
I don't have much more time to live.

01:37:29.730 --> 01:37:34.420
I was blessed to be the mother of such a strong and gentle child.

01:37:36.430 --> 01:37:38.260
I will entrust everything to you.

01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:52.570
Mother...

01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:57.990
It was an honor for me to have been born to such a person as you!

01:38:06.010 --> 01:38:07.120
He stopped it?

01:38:07.540 --> 01:38:09.920
What unbelievable strength!

01:38:09.930 --> 01:38:13.120
I've pierced through his solar plexus
with my right arm!

01:38:14.790 --> 01:38:16.260
Damn!

01:38:16.540 --> 01:38:18.090
It'll be daybreak soon!

01:38:18.760 --> 01:38:21.420
I have to kill him and get out of here!

01:38:22.710 --> 01:38:23.720
I can't...

01:38:23.730 --> 01:38:25.020
pull my arm out!

01:38:27.360 --> 01:38:29.470
I won't let you escape!

01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:39.560
No matter what Rengoku says...

01:38:41.130 --> 01:38:42.290
I have to...

01:38:42.630 --> 01:38:43.990
do it right now!

01:38:44.830 --> 01:38:47.960
I have to slice off the demon's head!

01:38:48.290 --> 01:38:49.490
Quickly!

01:38:52.290 --> 01:38:54.040
The sun's coming up!

01:38:54.290 --> 01:38:56.790
There'll be sunlight here!

01:38:57.130 --> 01:39:00.310
I have to get away!

01:39:11.810 --> 01:39:14.820
Not until I chop off your head!

01:39:24.490 --> 01:39:26.410
Move, Inosuke!

01:39:27.110 --> 01:39:30.070
Move your body for Rengoku's sake!

01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:36.170
Beast Breathing, Fang One...

01:39:36.630 --> 01:39:38.210
Pierce!

01:39:56.610 --> 01:39:59.720
I have to find refuge from the sunlight!

01:40:09.910 --> 01:40:11.490
That took too long!

01:40:11.490 --> 01:40:13.660
I have to get away from the sun!

01:40:20.740 --> 01:40:22.370
Don't run away!

01:40:22.980 --> 01:40:24.810
Don't run away, you coward!

01:40:24.810 --> 01:40:26.920
Don't run away!

01:40:29.260 --> 01:40:32.560
What the hell is that brat talking about?

01:40:32.560 --> 01:40:35.170
Doesn't he have a brain in his head?

01:40:35.180 --> 01:40:37.840
I'm not running away from you!

01:40:38.180 --> 01:40:40.440
I'm running away from the sun!

01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:43.690
And besides, the battle's already been decided!

01:40:43.990 --> 01:40:47.360
He'll run out of strength and die soon!

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:51.610
The Demon Slayer Corps...

01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:56.170
is always fighting you demons in the dark of the night where you have the advantage!

01:40:56.180 --> 01:40:58.290
That's right, us flesh and blood humans!

01:40:58.590 --> 01:41:00.710
Our wounds don't close up that easily!

01:41:00.960 --> 01:41:03.540
And we cannot regenerate a limb once lost!

01:41:04.540 --> 01:41:06.370
Don't run away, you bastard!

01:41:06.840 --> 01:41:08.060
You bastard!

01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:10.120
You coward!

01:41:10.380 --> 01:41:14.720
Rengoku is way more amazing than you!

01:41:14.730 --> 01:41:16.440
He's stronger!

01:41:16.690 --> 01:41:18.360
Rengoku didn't lose!

01:41:18.610 --> 01:41:20.640
He didn't let anybody die!

01:41:20.640 --> 01:41:24.270
He fought to the end! He protected them to the end!

01:41:24.280 --> 01:41:26.390
You're the one who lost!

01:41:26.390 --> 01:41:30.220
It's Rengoku who won!

01:42:04.890 --> 01:42:07.160
Stop yelling already.

01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:14.820
You'll reopen that stomach wound.

01:42:15.490 --> 01:42:17.520
You're badly injured, too, remember?

01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:20.910
If you die, young Kamado,

01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:23.540
it'll mean I'm the loser.

01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:27.010
Rengoku...

01:42:28.290 --> 01:42:29.710
Come over here.

01:42:30.130 --> 01:42:32.540
Let's talk a bit one last time.

01:42:50.560 --> 01:42:52.560
There's something that I remembered...

01:42:54.110 --> 01:42:56.440
while I was dreaming.

01:42:57.580 --> 01:42:59.290
You should go to my parents' home,

01:42:59.910 --> 01:43:02.540
the Rengoku residence.

01:43:03.490 --> 01:43:06.990
There should be some notes there left by the preceding Flame Hashira.

01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:10.960
My father read them often,

01:43:11.830 --> 01:43:15.420
but since I never did, I don't know what's in them.

01:43:17.390 --> 01:43:25.390
There might be some kind of record of that Hinokami Kagura you mentioned.

01:43:26.810 --> 01:43:30.390
R-Rengoku, please don't talk any more.

01:43:30.390 --> 01:43:32.770
Please stop the bleeding
with a breathing technique!

01:43:32.780 --> 01:43:35.070
Isn't there a way to close up your wounds?

01:43:37.030 --> 01:43:39.690
I'll be dead soon.

01:43:41.660 --> 01:43:45.360
I'm going to tell you all I can while I can still talk, so listen, will you?

01:43:47.190 --> 01:43:49.370
Tell my little brother Senjuro...

01:43:50.130 --> 01:43:52.040
to follow his heart...

01:43:52.590 --> 01:43:56.790
and to walk down the path
that he feels is right.

01:43:59.460 --> 01:44:00.790
Tell my father...

01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:04.340
that I want him to take care of himself.

01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:07.610
One more thing.

01:44:08.780 --> 01:44:09.890
Young Kamado...

01:44:12.480 --> 01:44:14.890
I believe in your little sister.

01:44:15.860 --> 01:44:18.440
I accept her as a member of the Demon Slayer Corps.

01:44:20.810 --> 01:44:26.120
I saw her bleeding as she protected
the humans inside the train.

01:44:27.130 --> 01:44:30.910
Anyone who risks their lives fighting demons to protect humans...

01:44:31.290 --> 01:44:35.040
is a rightful member of the Demon Slayer Corps
no matter what anyone else says.

01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:38.120
Go ahead and live with your head held high!

01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:48.640
No matter how devastated you may be by your own weakness or uselessness...

01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:51.720
set your heart ablaze.

01:44:54.810 --> 01:44:57.140
Grit your teeth and look straight ahead.

01:44:58.610 --> 01:45:01.690
Even if you stop and crouch down,

01:45:01.690 --> 01:45:04.660
the time won't wait for you...

01:45:04.660 --> 01:45:08.610
or snuggle you and grieve along with you.

01:45:10.240 --> 01:45:12.910
Don't feel bad that I'm going to die here.

01:45:13.530 --> 01:45:14.960
As a Hashira,

01:45:15.290 --> 01:45:18.170
of course I would shield my juniors.

01:45:18.710 --> 01:45:22.710
Any other Hashira would've done the same thing.

01:45:23.540 --> 01:45:25.670
We never let the young buds get nipped.

01:45:26.980 --> 01:45:28.290
Young Kamado...

01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:31.560
Young Boar Head...

01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:33.860
Yellow Boy...

01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:37.470
Keep learning and grow.

01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:39.640
And then,

01:45:40.280 --> 01:45:43.640
become the next Hashira supporting the Demon Slayer Corps.

01:45:45.140 --> 01:45:46.470
I believe in you.

01:45:47.610 --> 01:45:50.040
I believe in you all.

01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:17.260
Mother...

01:46:21.890 --> 01:46:24.110
Do you think I did it right?

01:46:26.410 --> 01:46:29.910
Did
carry out what I had to do...

01:46:30.530 --> 01:46:32.320
and my duties?

01:46:41.710 --> 01:46:44.120
You made me proud.

01:47:20.540 --> 01:47:22.790
When the train went off the rails,

01:47:23.210 --> 01:47:25.870
Rengoku had unleashed
all these techniques,

01:47:26.490 --> 01:47:30.790
He must've kept the damage to the cars to a minimum.

01:47:32.730 --> 01:47:34.340
I guess he did.

01:47:35.840 --> 01:47:38.140
I can't believe he's gone.

01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:41.420
I mean, did an Upper Rank demon
really show up?

01:47:41.730 --> 01:47:42.640
Yeah.

01:47:43.480 --> 01:47:45.810
Why would an Upper Rank come here?

01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:49.490
Was it that strong? I mean...

01:47:49.910 --> 01:47:51.070
Yeah.

01:47:53.490 --> 01:47:55.660
I'm so frustrated!

01:47:56.990 --> 01:47:59.740
As soon as I master one thing,

01:48:00.690 --> 01:48:05.190
I find another thick wall right in front of me...

01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:11.670
while more powerful people are fighting far beyond it.

01:48:12.540 --> 01:48:15.170
I just can't make it there yet!

01:48:16.540 --> 01:48:20.120
If I'm still stumbling around in a place like this, can I...

01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:22.440
Can I...

01:48:25.230 --> 01:48:29.470
ever become like Rengoku?

01:48:39.730 --> 01:48:42.240
Stop whining already!

01:48:43.990 --> 01:48:48.240
Stop saying dumbass things like, "Can I or can't I be like him?"

01:48:48.240 --> 01:48:53.490
He said he believes in you, so just think about how you're going to measure up to that!

01:48:53.490 --> 01:48:57.260
All living things just go back to the earth when they die!

01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:00.760
Sobbing or sniveling won't bring them back!

01:49:01.060 --> 01:49:03.510
Don't cry even if you have regrets!

01:49:03.860 --> 01:49:07.140
No matter how pathetic or humiliated you feel,

01:49:07.140 --> 01:49:09.510
you still have to go on living!

01:49:09.760 --> 01:49:11.390
But you're crying, too.

01:49:11.980 --> 01:49:15.160
There are tears flooding out
from that headpiece.

01:49:16.030 --> 01:49:18.160
I'm not crying!

01:49:28.690 --> 01:49:31.420
Get over here! We're gonna train!

01:50:15.460 --> 01:50:17.120
Is that so...

01:50:17.490 --> 01:50:19.460
Rengoku...

01:50:39.440 --> 01:50:44.110
So, even Rengoku'couldn't beat
an Upper Rank demon?

01:50:49.280 --> 01:50:51.110
I don't believe it.

01:50:58.090 --> 01:51:00.210
Namu Amida Butsu.

01:51:06.590 --> 01:51:11.210
I'll exterminate those repulsive demons!

01:51:19.030 --> 01:51:20.310
I see.

01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:34.670
So, not one of the 200 passengers
lost their lives?
2

01:51:35.330 --> 01:51:37.660
did a great job, then.

01:51:38.040 --> 01:51:39.870
What a remarkable child.

01:51:41.290 --> 01:51:43.210
I'm not sad.

01:51:43.630 --> 01:51:46.540
I don't have much longer to live, either.

01:51:49.340 --> 01:51:52.720
Soon, I'll be joining Kyojuro and the others...

01:51:53.140 --> 01:51:55.920
in the land of the dead.

01:52:14.780 --> 01:52:17.020
Rengoku!

01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:31.420
"Goodbye" and "Thank you"
at the top of my voice

01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:37.590
What's more important than grief

01:52:37.630 --> 01:52:43.970
Hoping that they reach you as we part

01:52:43.980 --> 01:52:49.190
In time for the warmth and pain

01:52:49.190 --> 01:52:55.130
I thought it would always be like this

01:52:55.130 --> 01:53:02.240
I envisioned our days-to come

01:53:09.330 --> 01:53:15.060
Still burn deep in our hearts?

01:53:15.060 --> 01:53:21.980
We met amidst a blazing journey

01:53:21.980 --> 01:53:27.870
Coming together, then letting go
for the sake of the future

01:53:27.870 --> 01:53:35.360
Every time a dream comes true,
I'll remember you

01:53:35.360 --> 01:53:40.940
Wishing to become stronger, I cried

01:53:40.940 --> 01:53:49.540
With my resolve as the parting gift

01:53:59.790 --> 01:54:05.790
Held captive by nostalgic memories

01:54:06.160 --> 01:54:12.530
Wailing at the cruelty of this world

01:54:12.530 --> 01:54:18.780
There will be even more as I grow older

01:54:18.780 --> 01:54:23.960
I never want to lose anything again

01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:29.910
By succumbing to the grief

01:54:29.910 --> 01:54:36.960
I might not feel pain anymore

01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:44.060
But your words, your wishes

01:54:44.060 --> 01:54:50.640
I swore to protect them to the end

01:55:03.030 --> 01:55:08.940
With a roar, it's crumbling down

01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:29.560
Our one and only, irreplaceable world

01:55:40.280 --> 01:55:46.990
The bundle of bursting light
that I reached out for and held so close

01:55:46.990 --> 01:55:52.960
Shimmered, then disappeared
for the sake of the future

01:55:52.960 --> 01:56:00.460
Going beyond the happiness and promises
with which I've been entrusted

01:56:00.460 --> 01:56:05.610
I'll keep moving forward
without glancing behind

01:56:06.730 --> 01:56:12.310
Looking straight ahead,
I'm going to cry out

01:56:13.040 --> 01:56:18.190
Lighting the flames in my heart

01:56:18.190 --> 01:56:30.060
Until I reach that distant future
