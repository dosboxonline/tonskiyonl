00:05.040 --> 00:05.049
.

00:05.120 --> 00:06.089
MALE NARRATOR:

00:05.209 --> 00:06.089
Previously on Debris...

00:07.110 --> 00:08.109
BRYAN: When was the last time

00:07.110 --> 00:08.109
you saw your father?

00:08.119 --> 00:10.210
In the morgue.

00:08.119 --> 00:10.210
Hed already taken his own life.

00:10.210 --> 00:12.130
I havent really gotten

00:10.210 --> 00:12.130
over that.

00:12.130 --> 00:14.050
Hes alive.

00:12.130 --> 00:14.050
He wrote the whole playbook.

00:14.060 --> 00:16.170
BRYAN:

00:14.060 --> 00:16.170
This is gonna affect Finola.

00:16.170 --> 00:18.000
Youve got his eyes.

00:18.010 --> 00:19.089
WOMAN:

00:18.010 --> 00:19.089
These men took my father.

00:19.089 --> 00:20.210
FINOLA:

00:19.089 --> 00:20.210
You gotta give me something.

00:20.210 --> 00:22.160
FERRIS:

00:20.210 --> 00:22.160
Did you do what I asked?

00:22.170 --> 00:23.199
I cant trust Ferris.

00:23.210 --> 00:25.070
And you cant trust Maddox.

00:25.079 --> 00:27.079
BRYAN: This man saved my life.

00:27.089 --> 00:30.030
Finola, hey. I will get

00:27.089 --> 00:30.030
what I need out of him.

00:30.039 --> 00:31.190
(power surges)

00:31.199 --> 00:33.149
They found your father.

00:35.210 --> 00:38.140
(woman panting)

00:53.140 --> 00:55.090
(panting continues)

01:17.109 --> 01:18.140
Hey!

01:29.200 --> 01:31.019
Help me!

01:48.069 --> 01:49.159
At the warehouse.

01:51.120 --> 01:53.060
(whimpers)

02:19.050 --> 02:20.099
(switch clicks)

02:44.000 --> 02:45.090
Youre making it worse!

02:48.009 --> 02:49.110
(grunts)

03:16.079 --> 03:18.120
Landos dead. Shes gone.

03:18.129 --> 03:20.189
Shes too far developed.

03:23.219 --> 03:26.189
â™ª (theme)

04:02.020 --> 04:04.020
MADDOX:

04:02.020 --> 04:04.020
Good morning, Finola.

04:04.020 --> 04:08.060
All right.

04:04.020 --> 04:08.060
As you are all well aware,

04:08.069 --> 04:12.129
we have identified

04:08.069 --> 04:12.129
that George Jones is alive.

04:12.139 --> 04:14.030
We think

04:12.139 --> 04:14.030
he is being held somewhere

04:14.030 --> 04:17.149
in an area called

04:14.030 --> 04:17.149
the Channeled Scablands

04:17.149 --> 04:19.220
in Eastern Washington State.

04:19.230 --> 04:22.029
Thankfully, with memories

04:19.230 --> 04:22.029
extracted from Anson Ash,

04:22.029 --> 04:23.230
weve narrowed that down.

04:23.230 --> 04:27.029
This highway marker here

04:27.029 --> 04:29.029
is near an area called

04:27.029 --> 04:29.029
Twin Lakes.

04:29.029 --> 04:31.189
Now, this memory comes up a lot.

04:31.199 --> 04:34.029
We are confident that INFLUX

04:31.199 --> 04:34.029
has an installation here,

04:34.029 --> 04:37.149
and what were looking for

04:34.029 --> 04:37.149
is within a five-mile radius

04:34.029 --> 04:37.149
of this location.

04:37.159 --> 04:40.170
Satellites and flybys

04:37.159 --> 04:40.170
havent picked up anything?

04:40.180 --> 04:43.110
No, but there is definitely

04:40.180 --> 04:43.110
something there.

04:43.120 --> 04:45.029
Were thinking subterranean?

04:45.029 --> 04:47.139
MADDOX: Could be, or camouflage.

04:47.149 --> 04:50.170
From the memory images that

04:47.149 --> 04:50.170
we were able to pull up here,

04:50.180 --> 04:54.120
you can see something that

04:50.180 --> 04:54.120
we think is a research facility.

04:54.120 --> 04:57.199
Our main priority is

04:54.120 --> 04:57.199
to recover George.

04:57.199 --> 05:00.160
This is a surgical

04:57.199 --> 05:00.160
in-and-out mission.

05:00.170 --> 05:03.120
Once you have George

05:00.170 --> 05:03.120
in a secure location,

05:03.129 --> 05:06.029
I will send an additional team

05:03.129 --> 05:06.029
to sweep the premises

05:06.040 --> 05:09.199
for intel, computers,

05:06.040 --> 05:09.199
any additional Debris we find.

05:09.209 --> 05:12.079
And do we know

05:09.209 --> 05:12.079
when those memories are from?

05:12.089 --> 05:13.199
A month? A week?

05:13.209 --> 05:15.079
No, we dont.

05:15.089 --> 05:17.189
This is all we have

05:15.089 --> 05:17.189
to work with for now.

05:17.199 --> 05:19.139
I wish we had more.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.069
Have a seat.

05:40.220 --> 05:45.100
I dont want you to use Finola

05:40.220 --> 05:45.100
on this mission, tactically.

05:47.220 --> 05:50.199
Finolas capable.

05:47.220 --> 05:50.199
I trust her instincts.

05:50.209 --> 05:53.230
Theres no way she would ever

05:50.209 --> 05:53.230
not be one of the first people

05:54.000 --> 05:55.129
through the door

05:54.000 --> 05:55.129
to retrieve her father.

05:55.129 --> 05:58.090
Youre gonna have

05:55.129 --> 05:58.090
to find a way.

05:58.090 --> 06:00.189
This isnt a retrieval

05:58.090 --> 06:00.189
for you, Bryan.

06:00.199 --> 06:03.100
George Jones doesnt

06:00.199 --> 06:03.100
come out of this alive.

06:09.009 --> 06:10.129
Yeah. Go for it.

06:10.139 --> 06:12.050
FERRIS (on phone):

06:10.139 --> 06:12.050
Theres a change of plan,

06:12.050 --> 06:13.160
at least on our end.

06:13.170 --> 06:15.220
I just sent Phelps

06:13.170 --> 06:15.220
a new directive.

06:15.230 --> 06:17.160
Okay. Yeah. What is it?

06:17.170 --> 06:20.100
We have operatives in place

06:17.170 --> 06:20.100
to stop your convoy

06:20.100 --> 06:21.220
after youve exfiltrated

06:20.100 --> 06:21.220
your father.

06:23.019 --> 06:25.050
I dont understand.

06:25.060 --> 06:27.060
FERRIS: We cant let the

06:25.060 --> 06:27.060
Americans take possession

06:25.060 --> 06:27.060
of him.

06:27.060 --> 06:30.199
There will be a plane waiting

06:27.060 --> 06:30.199
to bring you both back home.

06:32.220 --> 06:35.139
The Americans arent

06:32.220 --> 06:35.139
just gonna let us take him.

06:35.139 --> 06:38.120
Finola, whatever you

06:35.139 --> 06:38.120
and Phelps need to do,

06:38.129 --> 06:41.019
George needs

06:38.129 --> 06:41.019
to be on that plane.

06:41.029 --> 06:45.019
BRYAN: INFLUX has learned

06:41.029 --> 06:45.019
everything they can from

06:41.029 --> 06:45.019
George.

06:45.019 --> 06:47.019
Hes not a risk to us now.

06:47.029 --> 06:49.019
We can learn things from him.

06:49.029 --> 06:51.019
This is what were doing.

06:53.189 --> 06:55.100
Bryan, I know how hard this is.

06:55.110 --> 06:59.019
I know how hard this is to ask.

07:00.149 --> 07:02.129
Does the team know?

07:02.139 --> 07:04.129
Sha knows.

07:04.139 --> 07:07.019
Hes all you need.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.189
BRYAN:

07:23.120 --> 07:25.189
There must be another way.

07:27.029 --> 07:29.230
Do you remember

07:27.029 --> 07:29.230
that night in Marjah?

07:30.000 --> 07:32.230
When I told you to go into

07:30.000 --> 07:32.230
the north entrance of that

07:30.000 --> 07:32.230
compound?

07:33.000 --> 07:35.009
And you did it without

07:33.000 --> 07:35.009
any questions asked,

07:35.019 --> 07:39.079
even though you knew that was

07:35.019 --> 07:39.079
the most dangerous entrance?

07:39.079 --> 07:41.029
You remember that?

07:45.120 --> 07:47.199
Keep her out of the building.

07:47.209 --> 07:50.000
And you should take

07:47.209 --> 07:50.000
some comfort in knowing

07:50.000 --> 07:52.220
that you can tell her

07:50.000 --> 07:52.220
that her dad was killed

07:50.000 --> 07:52.220
in a crossfire.

07:54.120 --> 07:56.100
Trust me.

07:58.009 --> 07:59.040
All right.

07:59.040 --> 08:00.100
Ill stand by.

08:03.120 --> 08:04.180
Ill report back.

08:10.089 --> 08:12.000
George needs to be in London.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.199
Its the safest place

08:12.000 --> 08:15.199
for you to be as well.

08:15.199 --> 08:19.160
And youre needed here

08:15.199 --> 08:19.160
on multiple fronts.

08:19.160 --> 08:21.209
What does that mean?

08:21.220 --> 08:24.089
Dee Dee was arrested

08:21.220 --> 08:24.089
a few days ago for

08:21.220 --> 08:24.089
drug possession.

08:24.089 --> 08:29.170
I shut it down, but its clear

08:24.089 --> 08:29.170
she needs you right now.

08:29.170 --> 08:31.170
FINOLA:

08:29.170 --> 08:31.170
She didnt tell me that.

08:31.180 --> 08:33.090
FERRIS: You know

08:31.180 --> 08:33.090
theres nothing more Id like

08:33.090 --> 08:35.049
than to see our family

08:33.090 --> 08:35.049
reunited.

08:35.059 --> 08:37.169
You know how much

08:35.059 --> 08:37.169
I care about you.

08:37.179 --> 08:39.129
Its the right thing to do.

08:39.129 --> 08:41.120
Just follow Phelps lead,

08:41.129 --> 08:43.009
and hell bring you home.

08:43.019 --> 08:44.129
(door closes)

08:47.129 --> 08:49.159
Ferris told me

08:47.129 --> 08:49.159
theres gonna be a team

08:49.169 --> 08:51.129
waiting to ambush the convoy.

08:52.210 --> 08:54.210
To take my father and I

08:52.210 --> 08:54.210
back to London.

08:58.220 --> 09:00.190
That doesnt matter

08:58.220 --> 09:00.190
if hes dead.

09:03.019 --> 09:04.100
What?

09:04.100 --> 09:05.200
What do you mean?

09:08.230 --> 09:13.100
Maddox doesnt want your father

09:08.230 --> 09:13.100
coming out of this raid alive.

09:13.100 --> 09:16.039
What are you talking about?

09:16.049 --> 09:17.049
Why?

09:18.179 --> 09:20.129
I dont know.

09:21.169 --> 09:23.169
But he was adamant.

09:23.179 --> 09:26.049
Its an order.

09:23.179 --> 09:26.049
Sha knows too.

09:27.230 --> 09:30.059
There has to be something

09:27.230 --> 09:30.059
more than Ferris

09:30.059 --> 09:32.100
can offer to shed light on this.

09:32.100 --> 09:34.059
What could your father know?

09:34.059 --> 09:37.029
You keep asking me that.

09:34.059 --> 09:37.029
Why?

09:40.100 --> 09:42.210
Because there has to be answers.

09:42.220 --> 09:45.129
Just because you say there

09:42.220 --> 09:45.129
arent doesnt make it so.

09:47.110 --> 09:50.009
-Im trying to get clarity.

09:47.110 --> 09:50.009
-No.

09:50.019 --> 09:53.179
No, you dont need me

09:50.019 --> 09:53.179
to make sense of this for you.

09:53.190 --> 09:56.070
You need me to give you

09:53.190 --> 09:56.070
some sort of hope

09:56.070 --> 09:58.090
that Maddox, your mentor,

09:58.100 --> 10:01.070
is doing this for reasons

09:58.100 --> 10:01.070
that are just.

10:01.080 --> 10:03.029
I know what Maddox means to you,

10:03.039 --> 10:04.190
but this is my father,

10:04.190 --> 10:08.190
and Maddox ordering you

10:04.190 --> 10:08.190
to kill him is not normal.

10:11.059 --> 10:14.230
We wouldnt know any of this

10:11.059 --> 10:14.230
if we werent talking.

10:14.230 --> 10:18.169
If it wasnt for us wanting

10:14.230 --> 10:18.169
to know what we are involved in,

10:18.179 --> 10:20.190
you would be following

10:18.179 --> 10:20.190
that order.

10:20.190 --> 10:24.019
Think about that. Please.

10:26.080 --> 10:28.200
I cant guarantee your fathers

10:26.080 --> 10:28.200
safety in the United States,

10:28.200 --> 10:31.230
so one way or another,

10:28.200 --> 10:31.230
were gonna need

10:28.200 --> 10:31.230
to get him on that plane.

10:32.000 --> 10:32.220
Yeah.

10:35.039 --> 10:37.000
And then what?

10:37.000 --> 10:38.039
For you?

10:38.039 --> 10:41.179
After Maddox finds out

10:38.039 --> 10:41.179
you didnt follow the order?

10:45.110 --> 10:47.080
We need to figure this out.

10:47.090 --> 10:51.049
Ferris sent Phelps to help get

10:47.090 --> 10:51.049
my father to the plane.

11:01.120 --> 11:03.120
MAN (on radio):

11:01.120 --> 11:03.120
Tac Team Two

11:01.120 --> 11:03.120
to Tac Team One, over.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.179
Go Sha.

11:05.190 --> 11:07.169
MAN: Target zone ETA three-zero

11:05.190 --> 11:07.169
minutes, over.

11:07.169 --> 11:09.009
Roger that.

11:11.169 --> 11:13.080
What are we gonna do about Sha?

11:16.120 --> 11:17.230
I dont know.

11:23.129 --> 11:24.200
Bryan!

11:30.129 --> 11:32.049
Did you see her?

11:32.049 --> 11:33.129
Whered she go?

11:33.129 --> 11:35.039
Disappeared into thin air.

11:39.169 --> 11:41.059
FINOLA: She was here.

12:06.090 --> 12:09.200
FINOLA: What is it?

12:09.210 --> 12:11.190
BRYAN:

12:09.210 --> 12:11.190
Some sort of disturbance.

12:19.070 --> 12:21.000
(woman gasps)

12:22.100 --> 12:24.000
Please dont hurt me.

12:24.009 --> 12:25.139
Its okay.

12:24.009 --> 12:25.139
Were not gonna hurt you.

12:25.139 --> 12:27.059
Its okay.

12:27.059 --> 12:28.220
Its okay.

12:27.059 --> 12:28.220
were here to help you.

12:28.230 --> 12:31.029
Gomez, can you get us

12:28.230 --> 12:31.029
some water?

12:31.039 --> 12:32.049
Her neck...

12:38.149 --> 12:42.059
FINOLA: I think the Debris has

12:38.149 --> 12:42.059
been implanted under her skin.

12:45.190 --> 12:48.009
Please get it out.

12:54.029 --> 12:54.039
.

12:57.129 --> 12:59.000
FINOLA: Seems to have the same

12:58.029 --> 12:59.000
properties as the Nacho we

12:58.149 --> 12:59.000
discovered in New York.

13:00.019 --> 13:02.149
Its working through

13:00.019 --> 13:02.149
micro-vibration.

13:02.159 --> 13:05.029
Making her atoms move so fast

13:02.159 --> 13:05.029
that shes invisible?

13:05.029 --> 13:08.110
Thats my guess,

13:05.029 --> 13:08.110
but more importantly,

13:08.110 --> 13:13.159
having it inside her has meant

13:08.110 --> 13:13.159
to give her control over it.

13:13.159 --> 13:16.029
I mean, it must be some sort

13:13.159 --> 13:16.029
of lab out here.

13:17.159 --> 13:21.120
GOMEZ:

13:17.159 --> 13:21.120
Well, she still doesnt

13:17.159 --> 13:21.120
remember who she is.

13:21.120 --> 13:23.120
Okay. Do you wanna give us

13:21.120 --> 13:23.120
a second with that?

13:23.120 --> 13:25.029
Thank you. Thanks, guys.

13:30.120 --> 13:35.120
Hi. My name is Finola.

13:35.129 --> 13:38.039
This is my partner, Bryan.

13:38.039 --> 13:43.070
Can you tell me anything about

13:38.039 --> 13:43.070
the people that did this to you?

13:44.120 --> 13:49.120
They were doing experiments

13:44.120 --> 13:49.120
on me.

13:49.120 --> 13:51.120
There were others.

13:51.120 --> 13:56.049
Did you see this man

13:51.120 --> 13:56.049
when you were in there?

13:56.049 --> 14:01.009
Yeah, he was there.

13:56.049 --> 14:01.009
He was always there.

14:01.009 --> 14:03.159
Him? Did you see him?

14:03.169 --> 14:07.090
No. Maybe.

14:07.100 --> 14:10.070
Theyre always people

14:07.100 --> 14:10.070
being held captive.

14:12.049 --> 14:16.009
Do you remember any landmarks

14:12.049 --> 14:16.009
from where you escaped?

14:20.220 --> 14:23.210
There was a door.

14:23.220 --> 14:27.230
We ran out of it into the brush,

14:23.220 --> 14:27.230
and there was water.

14:29.100 --> 14:31.100
-Im sorry.

14:29.100 --> 14:31.100
-FINOLA: Its okay.

14:35.019 --> 14:38.039
Im going to leave you

14:35.019 --> 14:38.039
with Agent Gomez, okay?

14:38.049 --> 14:39.220
And hes gonna take you

14:38.049 --> 14:39.220
somewhere

14:39.230 --> 14:41.210
where they can help you.

14:41.220 --> 14:44.080
Okay? Youre safe.

14:48.049 --> 14:49.049
Thank you.

14:52.009 --> 14:56.009
I dont know.

14:56.019 --> 14:58.019
What dont you know?

14:58.019 --> 15:01.059
I dont know where

14:58.019 --> 15:01.059
the ball of light is.

15:07.100 --> 15:10.059
I never asked you that.

15:10.070 --> 15:12.009
You didnt?

15:14.139 --> 15:15.210
No.

15:24.029 --> 15:26.070
You know, in Pennsylvania,

15:26.070 --> 15:28.139
one of the clones

15:26.070 --> 15:28.139
of Eric King,

15:28.149 --> 15:30.019
I was interviewing him.

15:30.029 --> 15:32.110
Remember he asked me

15:30.029 --> 15:32.110
about a ball of light?

15:32.110 --> 15:35.090
And now shes just

15:32.110 --> 15:35.090
asked me about that.

15:35.100 --> 15:37.230
They were both affected

15:35.100 --> 15:37.230
by Debris.

15:37.230 --> 15:39.210
PHELPS:

15:37.230 --> 15:39.210
Medevac is 15 minutes out.

15:39.220 --> 15:41.149
Thank you.

15:41.149 --> 15:43.220
(thunder rumbles)

15:49.190 --> 15:51.070
Hello.

15:51.080 --> 15:53.059
Im forwarding you

15:51.080 --> 15:53.059
the latest satellite package.

15:53.070 --> 15:54.230
Theyre still out searching

15:53.070 --> 15:54.230
for George.

15:54.230 --> 15:57.090
The plane is standing by

15:54.230 --> 15:57.090
at the airstrip.

15:57.100 --> 15:59.220
Very good.

15:57.100 --> 15:59.220
Ill check in when I have it.

16:03.000 --> 16:06.159
It was such a beautiful walk.

16:06.159 --> 16:09.039
You should have come.

16:09.049 --> 16:12.039
You wouldve loved it.

16:12.039 --> 16:13.220
All right, lets go.

16:13.230 --> 16:15.080
You have to fix your face.

17:30.230 --> 17:32.140
FINOLA: This is it.

17:34.019 --> 17:35.180
She said it was near water.

17:35.180 --> 17:38.140
There was an old pumping plant

17:35.180 --> 17:38.140
here connected to the lake.

17:41.019 --> 17:43.059
SHA:

17:41.019 --> 17:43.059
Theres something down there.

17:43.059 --> 17:44.130
Looks like underground tunnels.

17:46.150 --> 17:48.039
Were on top of it.

17:50.140 --> 17:51.119
Here it is.

17:57.009 --> 17:58.170
Maddox say she doesnt go in.

17:58.180 --> 18:02.220
Stick with me.

18:02.230 --> 18:04.180
Youll get your opportunity.

18:14.190 --> 18:16.019
(radio, indistinct)

18:24.160 --> 18:27.069
(radio continues, indistinct)

19:30.210 --> 19:34.170
Its my fathers handwriting.

19:30.210 --> 19:34.170
Hes here.

19:42.049 --> 19:42.059
.

20:09.019 --> 20:09.190
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

20:09.140 --> 20:09.190
Its okay.

20:13.180 --> 20:17.180
Im here to help you, okay?

20:13.180 --> 20:17.180
I need you to get up. Okay?

20:17.180 --> 20:18.220
Okay.

20:27.140 --> 20:29.109
BRYAN:

20:27.140 --> 20:29.109
Bowen, Get them up

20:27.140 --> 20:29.109
to the staging area.

21:07.190 --> 21:09.180
(grunts)

21:13.069 --> 21:14.210
-You all right?

21:13.069 --> 21:14.210
-Its just a bruise.

21:14.220 --> 21:16.230
We need to find my father.

21:20.230 --> 21:22.089
MAN:

21:20.230 --> 21:22.089
Clear.

21:33.170 --> 21:35.109
Clear!

21:55.200 --> 21:59.019
(man whimpering)

22:02.079 --> 22:03.109
Dad.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.119
-Step aside.

22:20.000 --> 22:22.119
-No.

22:33.140 --> 22:35.019
I got it.

22:37.039 --> 22:40.009
FINOLA:

22:37.039 --> 22:40.009
Im not gonna let Sha kill

22:37.039 --> 22:40.009
my father.

22:52.140 --> 22:55.039
Its okay.

22:57.009 --> 22:59.089
Put it down.

22:59.099 --> 23:01.150
Lets get your father

22:59.099 --> 23:01.150
out of here.

23:08.150 --> 23:10.079
-Now.

23:08.150 --> 23:10.079
-Go.

23:15.220 --> 23:17.230
(alarm beeping)

23:26.009 --> 23:28.079
-MAN: Get back, get back!

23:26.009 --> 23:28.079
-Go!

23:34.190 --> 23:37.130
Get em out! Lets go!

23:40.029 --> 23:42.220
-Now!

23:40.029 --> 23:42.220
-Go!

23:49.109 --> 23:52.079
Come on, Phelps,

23:49.109 --> 23:52.079
lets get out of here.

23:49.109 --> 23:52.079
I got you.

23:58.099 --> 23:59.099
Finola!

24:02.079 --> 24:03.069
Come on.

24:05.059 --> 24:07.150
Watch yourself.

24:05.059 --> 24:07.150
Were good.

24:07.150 --> 24:10.019
Were clear.

24:07.150 --> 24:10.019
Wheres Bowen?

24:10.029 --> 24:13.140
-Hey, breathe, stay alive.

24:10.029 --> 24:13.140
-Bowen is gone.

24:13.150 --> 24:16.150
He probably took the people that

24:13.150 --> 24:16.150
we released to the staging area.

24:16.160 --> 24:18.210
-No. Bryan!

24:16.160 --> 24:18.210
-What?

24:18.220 --> 24:22.160
Bowens gone.

24:22.170 --> 24:24.039
So?

24:24.039 --> 24:26.099
Bowen is gone,

24:26.109 --> 24:30.099
which means he didnt

24:26.109 --> 24:30.099
even see my father.

24:30.109 --> 24:33.059
He cant tell Maddox

24:30.109 --> 24:33.059
about what he didnt see.

24:33.069 --> 24:34.079
Hes the only one left.

24:37.000 --> 24:41.019
Just tell Maddox that

24:37.000 --> 24:41.019
my father wasnt even here.

24:43.160 --> 24:45.230
We need to get

24:43.160 --> 24:45.230
the surveillance.

25:37.019 --> 25:40.009
(phone rings)

25:40.009 --> 25:41.009
Bryan.

25:41.019 --> 25:42.079
Bryan, can you hear me?

25:42.089 --> 25:43.180
-George wasnt there.

25:42.089 --> 25:43.180
-What?

25:43.180 --> 25:46.019
The Intel was bad.

25:43.180 --> 25:46.019
George was not there.

25:46.029 --> 25:49.130
Bowens alive.

25:46.029 --> 25:49.130
Sha and Phelps are dead.

25:46.029 --> 25:49.130
Finolas been injured.

25:49.140 --> 25:51.099
Im taking her to get

25:49.140 --> 25:51.099
treated right now.

25:51.109 --> 25:52.170
MADDOX: What do you mean

25:51.109 --> 25:52.170
he wasnt there? What--

25:52.180 --> 25:54.039
What the hell happened?

25:54.049 --> 25:56.039
Youre gonna have to deal

25:54.049 --> 25:56.039
with that, not me.

25:56.049 --> 25:58.029
Ill call you after,

25:56.049 --> 25:58.029
I gotta go.

26:00.019 --> 26:01.099
(phone beeps)

26:10.140 --> 26:15.009
Where do we have to go

26:10.140 --> 26:15.009
to follow Ferris plan.

26:33.049 --> 26:33.059
.

26:38.130 --> 26:39.019
GEORGE:

26:38.180 --> 26:39.019
How did you find me?

26:40.109 --> 26:44.009
One of the men, Anson Ash.

26:44.019 --> 26:46.130
I found you from his memories.

26:46.140 --> 26:48.029
Fantastic.

26:48.039 --> 26:50.019
(phone rings)

26:52.220 --> 26:55.130
-Yeah, Trisha.

26:52.220 --> 26:55.130
-Its Dee Dee.

26:55.140 --> 26:57.150
Youve been leaving me

26:55.140 --> 26:57.150
messages, but I cant

26:55.140 --> 26:57.150
use my phone.

26:57.150 --> 27:00.029
I think theyre listening

26:57.150 --> 27:00.029
to my calls and reading

26:57.150 --> 27:00.029
my texts.

27:00.029 --> 27:02.170
-Who?

27:00.029 --> 27:02.170
-Your boss, Ferris.

27:02.180 --> 27:05.089
Thats why I mentioned

27:02.180 --> 27:05.089
Michelles country house

27:02.180 --> 27:05.089
on the phone yesterday.

27:05.099 --> 27:06.180
She was literally standing

27:05.099 --> 27:06.180
in front of me.

27:06.190 --> 27:08.150
She made me call you.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.200
What are you talking about?

27:09.200 --> 27:11.200
She said that you were

27:09.200 --> 27:11.200
in danger,

27:11.210 --> 27:13.200
that I had to get you

27:11.210 --> 27:13.200
to come home because

27:11.210 --> 27:13.200
youre in trouble.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.079
What the hell is going on,

27:13.200 --> 27:15.079
Finola? Are you okay?

27:15.079 --> 27:18.119
Yeah. None of what

27:15.079 --> 27:18.119
shes saying is true.

27:18.119 --> 27:19.190
Why are they doing this?

27:19.200 --> 27:21.119
-Fi, Im scared.

27:19.200 --> 27:21.119
-I know.

27:21.119 --> 27:24.069
Dee Dee listen to me, okay?

27:21.119 --> 27:24.069
Im going to need for you

27:24.079 --> 27:27.069
to stay with Trisha until I can

27:24.079 --> 27:27.069
figure this out.

27:27.079 --> 27:28.200
Okay.

27:28.200 --> 27:31.019
Pack some things,

27:28.200 --> 27:31.019
and leave now,

27:31.029 --> 27:34.039
leave your phone behind,

27:31.029 --> 27:34.039
because they can track it.

27:34.039 --> 27:35.160
Go now.

27:35.160 --> 27:38.119
Okay. I love you.

27:38.119 --> 27:39.210
I love you.

27:42.190 --> 27:44.119
How is she?

27:44.130 --> 27:46.000
Whats happening?

27:46.009 --> 27:48.039
Pull over. Now.

27:54.160 --> 27:57.200
Now, you need to tell me

27:54.160 --> 27:57.200
right now,

27:57.210 --> 27:59.079
how are you alive?

28:01.180 --> 28:04.200
From what I understand,

28:04.210 --> 28:08.210
they took me from the morgue,

28:08.210 --> 28:10.200
and I was reanimated.

28:14.079 --> 28:19.049
They can only do it

28:14.079 --> 28:19.049
to a person once.

28:19.049 --> 28:24.230
I had no idea that the Debris

28:19.049 --> 28:24.230
had-- had these capabilities.

28:27.210 --> 28:30.089
They went in through eye.

28:57.059 --> 28:58.089
Finola.

28:58.099 --> 29:00.089
How is this possible?

29:00.099 --> 29:01.180
How is this possible?

29:01.190 --> 29:03.140
Hey, just--

29:01.190 --> 29:03.140
Hang on, Finola.

29:03.140 --> 29:07.000
Hes not going anywhere

29:03.140 --> 29:07.000
because they are liars, Bryan.

29:07.009 --> 29:10.220
They are liars, all of them.

29:10.220 --> 29:12.230
Whatd your sister say?

29:12.230 --> 29:18.049
That Ferris manipulated her

29:12.230 --> 29:18.049
to call me.

29:18.059 --> 29:22.230
Why? To get him home?

29:18.059 --> 29:22.230
To get me home?

29:26.119 --> 29:30.210
He is not going anywhere.

29:55.079 --> 29:58.000
BRYAN:

29:55.079 --> 29:58.000
How much can you remember,

29:55.079 --> 29:58.000
George?

29:58.000 --> 30:01.039
I think they damaged

29:58.000 --> 30:01.039
my hippocampus

30:01.039 --> 30:05.099
and thats the bridge between

30:01.039 --> 30:05.099
long and short-term memory,

30:05.109 --> 30:07.140
interference,

30:07.150 --> 30:11.220
consolidating and retrieving

30:07.150 --> 30:11.220
information.

30:14.150 --> 30:18.099
But I remember whats important.

30:18.109 --> 30:23.230
Can you think of any reason

30:18.109 --> 30:23.230
why Craig Maddox would want

30:18.109 --> 30:23.230
you dead?

30:25.069 --> 30:29.190
He and his government took

30:25.069 --> 30:29.190
Orbital away from me.

30:29.200 --> 30:32.029
I should think

30:29.200 --> 30:32.029
I would want him dead.

30:35.130 --> 30:37.230
But I dont. I dont.

30:41.009 --> 30:43.019
He wants me dead?

30:48.160 --> 30:52.150
Ill have to think about that.

30:52.160 --> 30:55.150
My death, your death, his death.

30:55.160 --> 30:58.200
I wouldnt lose sleep over it.

30:58.210 --> 31:01.119
Everyone on this Earth

30:58.210 --> 31:01.119
is going to die.

31:01.130 --> 31:03.210
Rather irrelevant, really.

31:05.210 --> 31:08.000
See...

31:08.009 --> 31:11.029
when they were holding me,

31:08.009 --> 31:11.029
I learned things

31:11.039 --> 31:13.170
about this organization,

31:11.039 --> 31:13.170
Influx--

31:13.180 --> 31:15.119
the scale, their ambition.

31:15.130 --> 31:21.119
They know as much about

31:15.130 --> 31:21.119
the alien technology

31:15.130 --> 31:21.119
as Orbital does.

31:21.130 --> 31:23.059
Maybe more.

31:23.069 --> 31:26.079
They are actively seeking

31:26.089 --> 31:30.049
a very dangerous piece

31:26.089 --> 31:30.049
of Debris.

31:30.059 --> 31:32.210
Its game-changing.

31:32.220 --> 31:36.099
Game-changing.

31:36.099 --> 31:40.180
And if they do, well, just

31:36.099 --> 31:40.180
refer to my previous statement

31:40.190 --> 31:43.000
about our deaths

31:40.190 --> 31:43.000
being irrelevant.

31:46.109 --> 31:50.099
They were forcing me

31:46.109 --> 31:50.099
to build this device,

31:50.099 --> 31:53.160
a device that would track

31:50.099 --> 31:53.160
this piece.

31:53.170 --> 31:55.049
It emits waves in a frequency

31:55.059 --> 31:59.190
that even Dr. Laghari

31:55.059 --> 31:59.190
couldnt comprehend.

31:59.190 --> 32:02.009
Where is he by the way?

32:02.019 --> 32:05.009
Dr. Laghari suffered a stroke.

32:05.019 --> 32:07.220
Hes in a facility in Idaho.

32:07.230 --> 32:10.230
You visited him.

32:11.000 --> 32:12.220
Dont you remember?

32:16.140 --> 32:18.190
Thats too bad.

32:18.190 --> 32:21.099
I could have used him

32:18.190 --> 32:21.099
right now.

32:21.109 --> 32:24.019
I mean, for all we know,

32:21.109 --> 32:24.019
the U.S. has already found it.

32:24.029 --> 32:26.220
Russians or the Chinese or...

32:29.000 --> 32:33.009
But even if they did,

32:29.000 --> 32:33.009
they wouldnt recognize

32:29.000 --> 32:33.009
the power it holds.

32:33.019 --> 32:34.210
They wouldnt understand.

32:34.220 --> 32:39.170
Thats one of the reasons

32:34.220 --> 32:39.170
why Influx brought me back

32:34.220 --> 32:39.170
to life.

32:39.180 --> 32:45.000
They believed that I was

32:39.180 --> 32:45.000
the only one that could

32:39.180 --> 32:45.000
build something to find it.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.039
And did you finish it for them?

32:57.069 --> 33:01.119
I think I did enough work

33:01.130 --> 33:04.200
to allow them

33:01.130 --> 33:04.200
to finish it themselves.

33:04.200 --> 33:07.069
And theyre close.

33:07.079 --> 33:11.079
I know. Im sure.

33:11.079 --> 33:13.150
What are they planning

33:11.079 --> 33:13.150
on doing with it?

33:13.160 --> 33:15.009
What does it do?

33:17.009 --> 33:19.009
I dont remember.

33:29.059 --> 33:29.069
.

33:51.140 --> 33:52.009
Is this okay for you, Dad?

33:52.210 --> 33:55.049
Yes. Its fine.

33:56.220 --> 33:57.230
Okay.

34:03.109 --> 34:05.009
I was...

34:08.070 --> 34:12.179
I was really worried

34:08.070 --> 34:12.179
about you.

34:12.190 --> 34:15.099
Im fine.

34:15.099 --> 34:18.170
I mean, Im okay.

34:24.099 --> 34:26.139
I know you made the...

34:30.050 --> 34:33.039
...decision

34:33.050 --> 34:35.030
to leave us alone.

34:37.099 --> 34:40.199
And I just--

34:40.210 --> 34:42.170
I dont know...

34:46.159 --> 34:51.050
...how you could have

34:51.059 --> 34:53.219
done that to us.

34:53.230 --> 34:57.070
But I dont know how you

34:53.230 --> 34:57.070
could have done that...

35:04.059 --> 35:05.190
...to me.

35:13.159 --> 35:18.070
Your mother was no longer here

35:13.159 --> 35:18.070
to make sense of the world

35:13.159 --> 35:18.070
for me.

35:20.150 --> 35:24.139
I was always drifting away

35:24.150 --> 35:27.030
from my original purpose.

35:30.039 --> 35:35.000
I really

35:30.039 --> 35:35.000
understand how important

35:35.000 --> 35:39.230
your work is to you.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.030
I just wished there was...

35:45.119 --> 35:50.079
...room in there for me.

35:50.090 --> 35:51.079
Thats it.

35:55.070 --> 36:00.019
Im sorry. I wasnt the father

35:55.070 --> 36:00.019
you needed, Finola.

36:00.030 --> 36:04.070
But now...

36:04.079 --> 36:07.119
this isnt about you

36:07.130 --> 36:11.130
or me or our relationship.

36:11.130 --> 36:16.010
This is about

36:11.130 --> 36:16.010
your childrens children.

36:16.019 --> 36:21.199
This is about making rice

36:16.019 --> 36:21.199
in-- in fields

36:21.210 --> 36:23.010
that should be barren.

36:23.010 --> 36:27.130
This is about regrowing

36:23.010 --> 36:27.130
forests in days

36:27.130 --> 36:29.070
rather than decades,

36:29.079 --> 36:33.070
making the world harmonious

36:29.079 --> 36:33.070
and having no wants.

36:33.079 --> 36:38.110
This is about restoring balance

36:33.079 --> 36:38.110
to a world thats on fire.

36:38.119 --> 36:41.030
Thats what this is about.

36:41.039 --> 36:45.050
And the only ones who

36:41.039 --> 36:45.050
could usher these things in

36:45.059 --> 36:49.030
are the beings that--

36:45.059 --> 36:49.030
that created this Debris--

36:49.039 --> 36:52.230
that-- the beings

36:49.039 --> 36:52.230
that we may never--

36:57.059 --> 37:03.010
They gave us the gift

36:57.059 --> 37:03.010
of their technology,

37:03.019 --> 37:05.059
and its going to take

37:05.059 --> 37:10.019
all of that technology

37:05.059 --> 37:10.019
to save mankind.

37:13.150 --> 37:16.139
Yeah. Well--

37:16.139 --> 37:20.059
-I, um...

37:16.139 --> 37:20.059
-Finola.

37:20.070 --> 37:22.119
Maybe I made mistakes.

37:25.090 --> 37:30.219
I viewed the world

37:25.090 --> 37:30.219
in a particular way,

37:30.230 --> 37:34.050
and now its all out of control.

37:35.190 --> 37:37.210
Do you understand?

37:37.219 --> 37:42.099
You are so important to me,

37:42.110 --> 37:46.050
and now I have a chance

37:46.059 --> 37:50.150
to set things right

37:46.059 --> 37:50.150
with you

37:50.159 --> 37:53.059
and with what Ive done.

38:22.039 --> 38:26.119
I need you to get

38:22.039 --> 38:26.119
Lagharis files from Orbital

38:26.130 --> 38:30.070
so I can build the scanner.

38:33.159 --> 38:37.190
Im ashamed to admit that

38:37.199 --> 38:40.219
I dont quite remember the math.

38:45.030 --> 38:48.230
I got a guy we can see tomorrow

38:45.030 --> 38:48.230
in Oregon.

38:49.000 --> 38:50.159
Hell have all the tools

38:49.000 --> 38:50.159
your your dad needs.

38:50.170 --> 38:52.010
Thats great.

38:54.210 --> 38:57.050
How do we handle Ferris?

38:57.050 --> 39:01.110
We cant Maddox.

38:57.050 --> 39:01.110
But we can use her.

39:01.119 --> 39:02.199
What do you mean?

39:02.210 --> 39:04.159
Well, you heard

39:02.210 --> 39:04.159
what my dad said.

39:04.170 --> 39:06.039
Its not going to be easy.

39:06.050 --> 39:07.199
Were gonna need

39:06.050 --> 39:07.199
a lot of resources.

39:11.090 --> 39:13.070
I think I know how to play this.

39:18.010 --> 39:19.079
All right.

39:21.130 --> 39:22.130
This should be good for a start.

39:26.219 --> 39:30.210
Those are just some

39:26.219 --> 39:30.210
of the things Ill need to--

39:26.219 --> 39:30.210
to build the scanner.

39:32.090 --> 39:34.190
Well get on this

39:32.090 --> 39:34.190
first thing tomorrow.

39:34.199 --> 39:37.210
Do you remember an Orbital

39:34.199 --> 39:37.210
scientist named Garcia

39:37.219 --> 39:39.130
from the early days?

39:41.130 --> 39:43.010
Yes.

39:43.019 --> 39:45.050
Hell have everything

39:43.019 --> 39:45.050
that you need.

39:48.210 --> 39:50.010
Um...

39:51.179 --> 39:53.150
Are you going to tell him

39:51.179 --> 39:53.150
about me?

39:55.179 --> 39:57.010
Do we have a choice?

39:58.170 --> 40:01.019
I wonder, should we leave now?

40:01.019 --> 40:03.059
-I have--

40:01.019 --> 40:03.059
-George.

40:03.059 --> 40:05.119
I have that I need in my head

40:05.130 --> 40:07.050
and as soon as we get

40:05.130 --> 40:07.050
the equipment, I can--

40:07.059 --> 40:09.090
George, no.

40:07.059 --> 40:09.090
Its okay.

40:09.099 --> 40:11.210
Were going to be on the road

40:09.099 --> 40:11.210
first thing.

40:11.219 --> 40:14.079
No. Im not safe here.

40:14.090 --> 40:18.030
George, youre gonna be safe

40:14.090 --> 40:18.030
as long as Im here.

40:18.039 --> 40:20.059
Im gonna be right outside.

40:26.230 --> 40:28.110
(door closes)

40:41.030 --> 40:42.139
(phone rings)

40:44.190 --> 40:45.219
Are you okay?

40:45.230 --> 40:47.170
FINOLA:

40:45.230 --> 40:47.170
Yeah, nothing serious.

40:47.179 --> 40:52.110
FERRIS:

40:47.179 --> 40:52.110
Maddox told me

40:47.179 --> 40:52.110
George wasnt there.

40:52.119 --> 40:56.010
Bryan only told him

40:52.119 --> 40:56.010
my father wasnt there.

40:56.019 --> 40:58.130
You have your father?

40:58.139 --> 41:01.139
FINOLA: Yes, I do.

41:01.150 --> 41:05.039
May I trouble you

41:01.150 --> 41:05.039
for some aluminum foil?

41:05.039 --> 41:07.039
Did he tell you how

41:05.039 --> 41:07.039
hes still alive?

41:07.039 --> 41:08.139
FINOLA: That is not important.

41:08.150 --> 41:11.099
Why does Maddox want

41:08.150 --> 41:11.099
my father dead?

41:11.110 --> 41:13.139
What are you talking about?

41:13.150 --> 41:16.019
You dont know.

41:16.030 --> 41:17.230
FERRIS:

41:16.030 --> 41:17.230
Of course, I didnt know.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.179
Yeah. Well...

41:20.190 --> 41:23.030
he does.

41:23.039 --> 41:25.000
And youre not getting him,

41:23.039 --> 41:25.000
either.

41:25.000 --> 41:27.219
I know what you did.

41:27.230 --> 41:31.139
I know that you tried

41:27.230 --> 41:31.139
to use Dee Dee to draw

41:27.230 --> 41:31.139
me back to London

41:31.150 --> 41:36.039
and you knew

41:31.150 --> 41:36.039
that once I saw him...

41:36.039 --> 41:39.019
how hard it would be for me

41:39.030 --> 41:41.159
to bring him back to you.

41:41.170 --> 41:46.010
I realized the moment that we

41:41.170 --> 41:46.010
touched down in London

41:46.010 --> 41:49.050
that I will be pulled

41:46.010 --> 41:49.050
off working on anything

41:46.010 --> 41:49.050
involving him.

41:49.050 --> 41:51.190
FERRIS:

41:49.050 --> 41:51.190
Okay. Yes.

41:51.199 --> 41:54.150
But if you cant see

41:51.199 --> 41:54.150
that I did this for

41:51.199 --> 41:54.150
your own good.

41:54.159 --> 41:58.150
FINOLA: There was piece of

41:54.159 --> 41:58.150
Debris that he told us about.

41:58.159 --> 42:02.039
He says its the reason

41:58.159 --> 42:02.039
why they took him.

42:02.050 --> 42:07.010
He says that we need to find it.

42:07.010 --> 42:09.000
Elaborate.

42:09.010 --> 42:11.050
FINOLA:

42:09.010 --> 42:11.050
I will let you know

42:09.010 --> 42:11.050
what you need to know

42:11.050 --> 42:12.170
when I learn it.

42:12.179 --> 42:14.090
But what I need from you

42:14.090 --> 42:17.050
is to obtain all

42:14.090 --> 42:17.050
of the Laghari files,

42:17.059 --> 42:20.050
because if I tried to access

42:17.059 --> 42:20.050
them, it would throw up

42:17.059 --> 42:20.050
a red flag.

42:20.050 --> 42:22.070
He needs them.

42:22.079 --> 42:23.190

42:22.079 --> 42:23.190
Ill say what I can do.
