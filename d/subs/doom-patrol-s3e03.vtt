01:35.762 --> 01:39.499
I mean, if one ignores the fact
that we appear to be dead,

01:39.599 --> 01:42.001
it's almost peaceful.

01:45.271 --> 01:46.773
Are we seriously fucking dead?

01:46.840 --> 01:48.408
[Cliff] Are you fucking
kidding me?

01:48.475 --> 01:50.910
Are you fucking kidding me?
We're not fucking dead.

01:50.977 --> 01:55.014
Sure, we're just crossing
the river. It's all good.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.751
[Cliff] Oh, I'm sorry,
did you want me to tell you
you were right?

01:58.818 --> 02:01.488
That the big green guy
with the death ray was bad?

02:01.588 --> 02:04.691
-Yeah.
-[Cliff] Fine.
You win, blue balls.

02:04.791 --> 02:07.994
This is horseshit.
Dead or not dead,
we're busting outta here.

-We're not busting out of here.
-Shut it, sack.

Listen up,

[Cliff] Fuck, yes.

02:21.040 --> 02:22.208
Question.

02:22.308 --> 02:25.478
Is anybody else starting
to feel a little freaky?

02:26.980 --> 02:27.947
Yeah.

If you were here,
I could be yelling at you!

04:46.986 --> 04:50.156
But you left me here all alone!

04:50.256 --> 04:53.192
And now I lost
the best friends I've ever had!

04:54.360 --> 04:56.496

to be here!

05:52.352 --> 05:54.187
[breathes shakily]

05:56.589 --> 05:57.724
I did this.

05:59.225 --> 06:01.094
That dumb resort was my idea.

06:02.328 --> 06:05.531
Niles handed me my destiny.

06:05.598 --> 06:10.670
He literally gave me
a key to my destiny

06:10.737 --> 06:12.605
I went on vacation.

I would've sworn it was.

sort of became

Why did you arrange
our dead friends

10:23.589 --> 10:27.827
Because leaving them jammed
in the shipping boxes
was weird and morbid.

10:27.927 --> 10:29.762
Seriously, Dorothy.

[Larry] Okay, listen,
if you two are ghosts,
so why can I see you?

close to death or extreme
horrors can see us.

to be the conduit.

to whoever
we're trying to reach.

she might still be conscious.

was beautiful and you just...

You just destroyed it like
everything else in your life,
you son of a bitch.

Hell, I know you tried
your ever fucking best
to screw me up.

Make me a bad father,
a bad husband,
but guess what, asshole?

16:52.011 --> 16:56.215
It didn't work.
You couldn't destroy me
because in the end,

16:56.315 --> 16:59.084
I knew my daughter.
I knew my grandson,

16:59.184 --> 17:02.087
and you know what?
They knew me.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.088
and, I don't know,

19:50.189 --> 19:51.890
I've sort of been
a superhero ever since.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.092
Trying to anyway.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.094
That sounds like something
your father would do.

19:58.030 --> 19:58.997
Mom...

20:01.400 --> 20:03.035
I am so sorry. I didn't mean--

20:03.101 --> 20:08.207
No, no. Do not blame yourself
for a single solitary thing.

20:09.608 --> 20:10.676
Do you hear me?

20:12.744 --> 20:14.246
Look at this.

20:14.346 --> 20:18.083
I am out here every day
hiking amongst all this beauty.

20:19.785 --> 20:22.454
I'm living my best life
here and now, Victor.

20:25.023 --> 20:25.924
Okay.

20:30.562 --> 20:33.131
I never heard you talk
about hiking
a day in your life.

20:33.232 --> 20:35.567
Uh, I beg your pardon.
Your father and I hiked

20:35.634 --> 20:38.103
-and rock climbed, too--
-Okay, now, hold up. When?

20:38.203 --> 20:41.440
[chuckles] Long before
you came along, chump.

20:41.540 --> 20:42.741
[both laughing]

20:44.876 --> 20:46.745
I met somebody.

20:46.812 --> 20:49.314
Now, this is what I'm here for.

20:49.414 --> 20:50.749
Name?

20:50.816 --> 20:53.585
Roni. She's cool, Mom.

20:53.652 --> 20:55.320
She's real.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.822
She just opened my eyes,

20:58.090 --> 20:59.725
but she's got a lot of pain.

21:01.460 --> 21:03.128
And she's done
some real bad things.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.332
And I know I'm supposed
to be this hero,

21:08.934 --> 21:11.403
but I just had to give
her another chance.

21:11.470 --> 21:14.006
That was the only thing
that felt right.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.407
No matter the risk.

21:16.308 --> 21:17.843
Of course, Dad says--

21:17.943 --> 21:20.245
Victor, I could
give a rat's ass
what your father said.

21:20.312 --> 21:24.082
Maybe he chose to turn you into
some sort of cybernetic weapon,

21:24.149 --> 21:27.953
but as your mother who was
half responsible for this,

21:28.020 --> 21:32.591
I'm proud to see
the sensitive, thinking,

21:32.658 --> 21:37.095
compassionate man I raised
is alive and well.

21:40.132 --> 21:44.836
Now take this and come on.

21:47.839 --> 21:49.107
We're almost there.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.552
[Crystal] These are all Rita's?

22:00.652 --> 22:03.455
If we're trying to reach
one of our friends,

22:03.522 --> 22:05.657
we're trying them all.

22:05.724 --> 22:08.960
Okay, you're the medium.
What do they do?

22:09.027 --> 22:10.562
Edwin has an extensive
working knowledge

22:10.662 --> 22:13.231
of dead creatures that might
try to slip into Larry.

22:13.332 --> 22:17.502
Charles has a stockpile
of weapons, costumes,
generally upsetting shit.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.639
[Larry] Okay, what's that for?

22:20.706 --> 22:21.873
It's a baseball bat.

22:23.175 --> 22:24.376
'Cause we're in the States.

22:27.379 --> 22:28.513
Mind your business.

22:30.182 --> 22:31.383
[Larry clears throat]

22:40.525 --> 22:42.561
[sex ghosts
moaning in pleasure]

22:45.731 --> 22:47.165
[Larry] Oh, God.

22:53.105 --> 22:55.173
Boys. Turnip!

22:57.008 --> 22:59.344
All of your sex ghosts
have the same safe word.

22:59.411 --> 23:01.046
Just FYI.

23:01.113 --> 23:03.048
They need
a cabinet particulier.

23:06.218 --> 23:09.421
It's a private room
for romantic trysts.

23:11.957 --> 23:14.760
Honestly, it's a perfectly
commonplace phrase
when I was alive.

23:18.597 --> 23:20.632
[Crystal exhales deeply]

23:20.732 --> 23:24.469
[gasps] Wait,
I've got something.

23:24.569 --> 23:27.739
But if this is Rita,
I'm sensing...

23:27.806 --> 23:31.309
it's like she's here
and on the other side.

23:31.410 --> 23:32.978
What does that mean?

23:33.078 --> 23:36.448
It's not like a normal thing,
so I don't exactly know, but...

23:36.548 --> 23:37.916
[wind blows]

23:39.084 --> 23:41.753
[distorted]
Larry, call out to Rita.

23:44.956 --> 23:47.926
-[Larry]<i> Rita?</i>
<i>Rita, can you hear me?</i>
-Larry?

23:50.962 --> 23:53.432
[in Rita's voice]
<i>Larry, we're trapped in...</i>

23:53.498 --> 23:55.333
<i>It feels like hell.</i>

23:55.434 --> 23:57.836
<i>-I think it's hell.</i>
-[Edwin] It's not hell.

23:58.670 --> 24:00.105
Trust me.

24:00.172 --> 24:02.741
<i>-[Rita] Who was that?</i>
-Rita, it's Dorothy. Hello.

24:02.808 --> 24:04.743
You said you were
with the others?

24:04.810 --> 24:06.778
We're under some kind of

24:06.845 --> 24:09.681
black tunnel,
with lights that pass by.

24:09.781 --> 24:11.349
Sounds like
the tunnel of souls.

24:12.317 --> 24:13.752
They're still being processed.

24:13.819 --> 24:16.655
So they're not gone?
Do you know what they are?

24:16.755 --> 24:18.523
Technically.

24:18.623 --> 24:21.593
Don't worry, Rita.
We're going to come
and get you. You'll be okay.

24:21.660 --> 24:23.628
Right, that is not the plan.

24:24.496 --> 24:26.498
[screaming]

24:31.503 --> 24:32.704
[screaming]

24:32.804 --> 24:35.540
Wait! You don't have to fight.

24:45.283 --> 24:48.119
Well, we did what
we'd said we do,
and we'll email you an invoice.

24:48.186 --> 24:51.456
If you wanna go
to the afterlife,
do it yourselves.

24:51.523 --> 24:52.724
[Larry] Wait, wait.

24:52.824 --> 24:55.193
Wait. We don't know how.

24:55.293 --> 24:56.528
Please.

24:56.628 --> 24:59.331
I lost my mom and then my dad.

24:59.397 --> 25:01.900
I can't lose my friends, too.
They're all I have.

25:03.468 --> 25:04.402
You lost...

25:05.670 --> 25:07.405
This isn't our problem anymore.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.541
[Larry] Crystal.

25:09.641 --> 25:12.010
Look, imagine what it's like
to know there might be
a way to get your family back.

25:13.211 --> 25:14.746
But you can't do it
without help.

25:17.983 --> 25:19.050
[sighs]

25:20.986 --> 25:22.487
Right, we going?

25:22.554 --> 25:25.156
I think maybe we should help.

25:25.223 --> 25:29.361
Oh, fuck right off.
You know Death
is looking for us.

25:29.427 --> 25:30.996
Parading around
in the afterlife

25:31.062 --> 25:33.064
seems like a keen way
to get her attention.

25:33.164 --> 25:35.033
Crossing over is a big ask.

25:35.100 --> 25:37.102
We don't usually go in
for that sort of thing,
Crystal, and you know it.

25:37.202 --> 25:40.872
[Larry] Whoa. Hold up, hold up.
There's an actual Death?

25:40.939 --> 25:43.074
Like an actual
capital "D" death

25:43.174 --> 25:45.610
that is looking
for you specifically?

25:45.710 --> 25:48.380
-Mind your business.
-This is what
I'm talking about.

25:49.714 --> 25:52.784
Yes, it's different
and whatever, scary.

25:52.884 --> 25:55.620
And yes, it is riskier
for you two than it is for me.

25:55.720 --> 25:58.857
But Edwin, no one knows
the afterlife like you.

25:59.858 --> 26:01.626
And Charles will protect you.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.728
-I don't need Charles
to protect me.
-I'd do it anyway, won't I?

26:03.795 --> 26:06.364
You say you started
this agency to help people,

26:06.431 --> 26:08.767
to have a purpose with
all this time on your hands.

26:08.867 --> 26:11.870
You want to be like those guys
from the detective novels.

26:11.937 --> 26:13.939
Okay, I vote we help.

26:14.773 --> 26:15.941
I also vote we help.

26:16.041 --> 26:17.375
-What?
-Sorry.

26:17.442 --> 26:19.544
-I vote you help, too.
-You don't get a vote.

26:25.216 --> 26:26.818
Fine.

26:26.918 --> 26:29.254
But if we get caught,
you'll feel absolutely
gutted, Crystal.

26:29.321 --> 26:31.556
There he is.
There's a brave lad.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.293
Okay, Larry. We'll go with you.

26:35.393 --> 26:38.263
Your connection to Rita
will be a bit of
a flashlight in the dark.

26:38.330 --> 26:41.600
[Larry] No, no.
See... 'Cause I'm alive.

26:41.666 --> 26:43.668
And if I'm alive,
then how could I go with you?

26:46.771 --> 26:48.273
Love this.

26:48.340 --> 26:51.576
You're going to astral project.

26:51.643 --> 26:53.345
So your soul
will leave your body.

26:53.445 --> 26:55.080
Oh, just like
the negative spirit.

26:56.815 --> 26:57.949
Not like that.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.518
Sorry, never mind.

27:00.619 --> 27:02.120
Here. Take this.

27:03.655 --> 27:07.258
Concentrate. What do you see?

27:15.500 --> 27:17.869
[Larry] Oh,
it's a space shuttle.
Yeah. Like--

27:17.969 --> 27:20.438
Oh! Ow! Fuck!

27:21.106 --> 27:22.540
God! What the...

27:22.641 --> 27:25.710
What... What did you just...
Look, look.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.779
Wha... Look at me.

27:27.846 --> 27:29.848
Right. We enter here.

27:29.948 --> 27:31.716
Stay close to us.

27:31.816 --> 27:33.685
Edwin has a proper knowledge
of how things work
over on this side.

27:33.785 --> 27:35.186
We'll keep an eye
on things here.

27:52.237 --> 27:56.341
[Larry] Uh, this is
not what I expected
the afterlife to look like.

27:56.408 --> 27:58.977
[Edwin] This isn't
the afterlife.

27:59.044 --> 28:02.881
It's more like a road
to the afterlife.
It's a road to a lot of places.

28:02.981 --> 28:07.485
[Charles] Edwin's
been dead since 1916,
so he spent a lot of time here.

28:07.552 --> 28:09.754
That bat is in case
we see Death?

28:09.854 --> 28:14.492
Okay, I get that you're doing
the very adult thing
of using humor to hide anxiety,

28:14.559 --> 28:17.595
but you're
a tourist here, right?

28:19.364 --> 28:20.699
Death is no joke.

28:25.203 --> 28:28.540
Death's quite nice, actually.
And she is super fit.

28:28.606 --> 28:30.842
It's the things
that work for her
you have to worry about.

28:39.417 --> 28:44.522
[Cliff] There's no way
my daughter reconciled
with a shitheel like you.

28:44.589 --> 28:46.291
How about a shitheel like you?

28:47.392 --> 28:48.793
Not the same.

28:48.893 --> 28:51.796
Well, you believe
what you want, Cliffie.

28:51.896 --> 28:55.934
The fact is, you decapitating
yourself and Kate

28:56.034 --> 28:58.636
kicked off a long
and fruitful relationship.

28:59.437 --> 29:00.705
[Cliff] Bullshit.

29:02.607 --> 29:06.578
Honestly, the whole
love-in with Clara

29:06.644 --> 29:09.948
almost made me wanna do
a do-over with you
and your mom.

29:10.048 --> 29:11.983
Really? Okay.

29:12.083 --> 29:14.385
Since we're stuck together
for all eternity,

29:14.452 --> 29:16.955
you want a do-over,
let's do a do-over.

29:17.055 --> 29:18.890
I'll start. Fuck you!

29:20.592 --> 29:22.961
I'm afraid that's not
how it works here, son.

29:24.462 --> 29:26.397
I'm just a welcoming committee.

29:27.332 --> 29:30.135
Your forever is that way.

29:35.640 --> 29:39.778
Good. If it means forever
getting away from your ass,
sign me up.

29:49.487 --> 29:50.655
That's it?

29:52.524 --> 29:53.625
Yes, sir.

30:02.834 --> 30:08.506
Um, wh... When I mentioned
my parents earlier,

30:08.606 --> 30:12.010
-your face was...
-What about it?

30:12.110 --> 30:15.213
Oh, nothing.
It just looked like maybe--

30:15.313 --> 30:17.148
Look, I'm playing this game
to distract myself

30:17.215 --> 30:21.052
from the fact I just sent
my best friends
into, like, danger.

30:21.152 --> 30:23.955
If you have a question,
just ask.

30:24.022 --> 30:25.523
Are your parents dead, too?

30:33.631 --> 30:34.632
Whoa.

30:35.733 --> 30:36.734
Whoa.

30:41.005 --> 30:42.173
My slot car?

30:43.741 --> 30:45.476
What're you doing here,
little buddy?

30:47.478 --> 30:49.547
Wait, that's Cliff.

30:49.647 --> 30:51.216
Does that mean
Cliff can hear us?

30:52.183 --> 30:53.585
It's not an exact science,

30:53.685 --> 30:56.487
but I think it means
he's not fully dead yet.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.023
Really?

31:00.859 --> 31:02.393
Maybe we can reach them all.

31:03.528 --> 31:04.863
[sighing in relief]

31:06.097 --> 31:07.532
[whooshing]

31:09.767 --> 31:12.437
Whoa! Wait! [yells]

31:16.741 --> 31:18.009
[grunts]

31:20.245 --> 31:22.547
Uh... What the fuck?

31:23.514 --> 31:24.716
[Crystal exhales]

31:29.053 --> 31:30.588
[exhales]

31:41.266 --> 31:45.570
[Larry] Okay.
This tree is terrifying.
Must be where we're headed.

31:46.771 --> 31:48.640
Now we enter the afterlife.

31:50.642 --> 31:55.213
But the price to open
the door is...pain.

31:59.417 --> 32:04.122
You, uh, you don't
have to do that, Edwin.
We can find another way in.

32:04.222 --> 32:05.456
[Larry] I've got some pain.

32:08.793 --> 32:12.664
I... I can afford to spare
some pain to open the door,
or whatever. I'll do it.

32:13.998 --> 32:15.900
That's nice of you.

32:17.335 --> 32:18.503
It's just...

32:19.637 --> 32:20.838
You see that lever?

32:21.606 --> 32:23.241
That's my pain.

32:23.308 --> 32:25.310
I have to pull it.

32:25.410 --> 32:30.782
Charles never officially
crossed over when he died,
and you're not actually dead.

32:30.848 --> 32:35.253
I'm the only one
this place knows.

32:35.320 --> 32:37.588
[sighs] I'll get to it.

32:37.655 --> 32:40.124
I'd be a right shit
detective if I didn't.

32:41.426 --> 32:42.694
Hold this, please.

32:46.831 --> 32:47.865
All right.

32:49.634 --> 32:50.768
[sighing]

33:01.512 --> 33:02.880
[creatures screaming]

33:02.981 --> 33:04.549
[Edwin whimpering]

33:09.454 --> 33:10.788
[door creaking]

33:14.058 --> 33:16.694
[breathing heavily]
Oh, yeah. Let's get to it.

33:17.795 --> 33:19.130
[exhales]

33:34.679 --> 33:36.414
[all singing in Spanish]

34:02.840 --> 34:03.941
Hmm...

36:17.642 --> 36:19.210
[gasping]

36:21.479 --> 36:23.247
What the fuck?

36:23.347 --> 36:25.483
I was supposed to go
to my afterlife.

36:25.550 --> 36:26.651
[Cliff] Same.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.722
[Edwin] The Watchers.
They mind the tunnel.

36:32.590 --> 36:34.258
Keep the souls in place.

36:35.660 --> 36:38.196
Right, just we'll want
to avoid them.

36:44.869 --> 36:47.038
He's afraid of water.

36:47.104 --> 36:48.940
-[Larry] Why?
-It's private.

36:50.441 --> 36:52.210
You're nosy, right?

36:53.077 --> 36:54.412
I'll make sure he's fine.

36:54.512 --> 36:56.113
I'm not scared.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.515
Just... You know.

36:57.582 --> 36:59.250
We know.

36:59.350 --> 37:01.118
All right, just so we're clear.

37:05.556 --> 37:07.291
[Larry] I was saying
to Charles earlier,

37:09.427 --> 37:12.930
it seems like you like
each other...a lot.

37:16.801 --> 37:19.937
-Like, maybe
you have feelings that--
-He's my mate.

37:21.872 --> 37:23.741
Don't be crass, all right?

37:29.614 --> 37:31.549
Even if I did, it...

37:31.616 --> 37:34.652
it wouldn't be normal.
It wouldn't be normal,
so why talk about it?

37:35.886 --> 37:38.122
[Larry] Sorry. I just, uh...

37:40.458 --> 37:41.826
I used to think that.

37:43.160 --> 37:44.996
But it is normal. Now.

37:46.764 --> 37:49.233
I mean, it's not 1916,
you know?

37:50.234 --> 37:52.970
Right. Well, I'm not like you.

37:55.973 --> 37:57.975
But thanks for the concern.

38:03.114 --> 38:05.082
[boys laughing]

38:11.789 --> 38:14.458
[breathing heavily]

38:14.525 --> 38:17.361
[Larry] Um,
is he about to freak out?

38:17.461 --> 38:19.130
[Charles]
I'm brilliant. Thanks.

38:20.464 --> 38:21.866
Died of hypothermia in a lake.

38:21.966 --> 38:25.303
But anything for a case. Right?

38:25.369 --> 38:27.471
That river can sod off.

38:27.538 --> 38:30.174
There's a lad.
No worries at all.

38:30.274 --> 38:35.813
[Larry] Um, if this is the part
where I'm a flashlight,
why isn't it glowing?

38:35.880 --> 38:38.983
That's just a prop
Crystal gave you to make you
feel more comfortable.

38:39.050 --> 38:41.786
-She's slick like that.
-She's good.

38:43.621 --> 38:46.891
You'll just...feel her.

38:48.025 --> 38:50.394
In theory.

38:50.494 --> 38:54.465
-[Larry] In theory?
-Fuck it if we know, mate.

38:54.532 --> 38:56.734
Hope you weren't
counting on us for this part.

38:56.834 --> 38:59.970
Right. So are we
doing this or...

39:02.640 --> 39:03.741
[Larry sighs]

39:13.684 --> 39:16.087
[panting] You, uh...
You got that stone?

39:16.187 --> 39:17.355
Yeah.

39:21.692 --> 39:23.861
Your father and I used
to have this ritual that

39:23.928 --> 39:25.763
every time we would
come up here,

39:25.863 --> 39:28.566
I would put a rock
under this tree
and he would call me crazy.

39:28.666 --> 39:31.035
[chuckles] Did he have a point?

39:31.102 --> 39:33.404
Maybe. But I got
a tree full of rocks.

39:33.504 --> 39:35.172
[both laughing]

39:40.745 --> 39:42.113
That's your path, son.

39:43.447 --> 39:44.582
My what?

39:46.851 --> 39:48.119
Your afterlife.

39:49.720 --> 39:51.856
Okay, Victor.
I'm doing my best
not to cry here.

39:51.922 --> 39:54.692
So could you do us both a favor

39:55.926 --> 39:57.395
and get your butt over there?

40:01.065 --> 40:04.602
What did you mean
when you said Dad chose
to make me into a weapon?

40:06.137 --> 40:08.139
He said he had
no choice at all,

40:08.239 --> 40:10.107
that this was
the only way to save me.

40:12.543 --> 40:15.646
Victor, when you walk
down that path,

40:15.746 --> 40:19.483
anything that happens
from here is your choice.

40:19.583 --> 40:20.785
-Focus on that.
-Mom.

40:20.885 --> 40:24.722
Your father chose
to make you a hero.

40:26.724 --> 40:28.092
Was that so wrong?

40:49.146 --> 40:50.281
[sighs]

41:01.158 --> 41:02.693
[whooshing]

41:09.800 --> 41:11.001
What's this?

41:11.101 --> 41:14.939
Oh, it's nothing.
I... I was trying to...

41:15.005 --> 41:19.276
-It's stupid.
-Trying to contact
someone else?

41:19.343 --> 41:22.880
My dad and I
used to watch<i> Willy Wonka</i>
<i>and the Chocolate Factory</i>

41:22.980 --> 41:25.683
every time he'd visit me.
[sighs wearily]

41:28.486 --> 41:30.187
You could have just told me.

41:30.287 --> 41:34.358
-Well, you're a bit intense.
-Yeah.

41:34.458 --> 41:36.160
[chuckles]

41:36.227 --> 41:40.531
And I haven't
spent a lot of time
around other teenage girls.

41:42.166 --> 41:45.402
So, I suppose I was nervous.

41:47.905 --> 41:50.841
All right. Let's cut the shit
and just be cool girls.

41:50.908 --> 41:53.210
My only friends in the world
are two dead boys,

41:53.310 --> 41:56.714
and I'm worried about them,

41:56.814 --> 42:00.017
but, like, only, like,
a little bit worried. I mean,
they can handle themselves.

42:01.519 --> 42:04.388
But, like, it's good
that we have each other.

42:06.557 --> 42:10.160
Yeah. How, how
did you meet them?

42:10.227 --> 42:13.163
I wouldn't know
where to begin
with boys. [chuckles]

42:15.499 --> 42:18.602
A demon named David
possessed me for over a year.

42:22.606 --> 42:25.843
[sighs] I did terrible things.

42:28.512 --> 42:31.782
Edwin and Charles,
were the ones who finally
evicted him from my body.

42:32.883 --> 42:34.051
That's how we met.

42:35.019 --> 42:36.720
They're brave, aren't they?

42:36.787 --> 42:39.456
[scoffs] I mean,
they've been doing this
for, like, decades.

42:39.557 --> 42:43.627
So, yeah,
I guess they are brave.

42:45.095 --> 42:47.598
But Dorothy, we're all just
a bunch of fucked up kids

42:47.698 --> 42:50.301
trying to hold shit together
by playing detectives.

42:50.401 --> 42:53.604
-We've all got baggage.
-Like, with David the demon?

42:56.407 --> 42:57.408
Yeah.

42:59.476 --> 43:02.746
David took some things
from me on his way out.

43:02.813 --> 43:04.582
All of the memories
of my parents.

43:04.648 --> 43:08.886
Anything that would help me
know them or find them.

43:10.154 --> 43:13.457
So my mission is to find David,

43:13.557 --> 43:16.293
fuck him up and get
those memories back.

43:17.761 --> 43:21.432
[sighs] Wow. That's a lot.

43:24.935 --> 43:28.472
People say that
it's better to move on.

43:28.572 --> 43:30.908
They'll say that to you
about your dad, too,

43:30.975 --> 43:33.177
and, um, it's wise advice.

43:37.615 --> 43:39.516
But screw those people.

43:39.617 --> 43:42.920
Don't sit in this big house
feeling sad.

43:42.987 --> 43:45.923
Find a way to reach your dad
if you think you can.

43:45.990 --> 43:48.258
Dorothy, we both know
there's all kinds of

43:48.325 --> 43:50.494
crazy shit in this world
that can happen.

43:51.462 --> 43:52.630
[softly] Yeah.

43:52.696 --> 43:55.099
Growing up with goals
is important.

43:55.165 --> 44:00.137
For me, having a personal
vendetta is, like,
really healthy.

44:10.280 --> 44:11.682
[gasps]

44:13.717 --> 44:15.019
[grunts]

44:17.855 --> 44:18.889
Where's Rita?

44:18.989 --> 44:21.225
[Cliff] Unclear.
Maybe she escaped.

44:21.325 --> 44:22.693
So what the hell
are we waiting for?

44:22.793 --> 44:25.229
Maybe she escaped?
Maybe something worse.

44:25.329 --> 44:27.398
[Cliff] Who fucking
cares? [grunts]

44:27.498 --> 44:30.401
We're getting
the fuck out of here.
We're gonna live again.

44:30.501 --> 44:35.205
And I'm gonna be
the best fucking grandfather
the world ever saw,

44:35.305 --> 44:40.310
so I can fuck my father
in the forehead
forever for thinking

44:40.377 --> 44:42.146
he could out-grandpappy

44:42.212 --> 44:44.348
Cliff fucking Steele.

44:44.415 --> 44:45.749
[metal clanging]

44:53.057 --> 44:54.491
[Cliff] Are you shitting me?

44:55.426 --> 44:56.927
[yells]

44:59.229 --> 45:00.998
[breath trembling]

45:08.539 --> 45:09.873
[Larry] [softly] Rita?

45:11.208 --> 45:12.342
[whispers] Larry?

45:13.277 --> 45:14.411
[Larry] Rita?

45:15.779 --> 45:17.614
-Rita?
-Larry.

45:17.715 --> 45:19.450
[both chuckle softly]

45:20.718 --> 45:21.885
[Larry] I got you.

45:22.953 --> 45:24.354
Now that's a proper hug.

45:26.223 --> 45:28.058
-Who?
-[Larry] I'll tell you later.

45:32.730 --> 45:33.797
Steady now. We're in for it.

45:33.897 --> 45:35.699
-Watchers?
-Watch... What do we do?

45:38.902 --> 45:40.871
I'm sorry.
Is that supposed to...

45:40.938 --> 45:44.241
It's the States,
it's an American afterlife,
I'm using the bat.

45:44.308 --> 45:45.409
Okay.

45:49.146 --> 45:50.914
Oh, thank God.

45:50.981 --> 45:54.618
Larry? Shouldn't you be
on Jupiter or some shit?

45:54.718 --> 45:57.988
[Larry] You know, funny,
it's not actually me.
It's an astral projection.

45:58.088 --> 46:00.491
I actually don't care.

46:00.591 --> 46:01.992
-[Larry] Yep, yep.
-[Cliff] Okay.

46:02.092 --> 46:05.095
Time to taxidermy this turkey.
Which way's home?

46:05.162 --> 46:07.397
Yeah, I'm thinking
you shouldn't have done that.

46:07.464 --> 46:09.333
Who brought judgy Harry Potter?

46:09.433 --> 46:11.568
[woman chuckling maniacally]

46:18.642 --> 46:20.410
[Larry] Who's that lady?

46:20.477 --> 46:23.347
-That's no lady.
-She works for Death,
and she's not here for you.

46:23.447 --> 46:28.352
Well, look at this.
Oh, you naughty boys.

46:28.452 --> 46:30.854
I'm so glad you've
come to your senses.

46:31.588 --> 46:34.258
Charles. Edwin.

46:34.324 --> 46:37.461
Almost bed checks,
so come along.

46:37.528 --> 46:39.129
Why don't you
back the fuck up, girl,

46:39.196 --> 46:40.998
before you get
a boot up your ass.

46:41.098 --> 46:43.634
No, no, no, no.
That's so not how
any of this works.

46:43.700 --> 46:45.536
Not letting her anywhere
near you, Edwin. You got that?

46:45.636 --> 46:47.971
[chuckling maliciously]

46:48.038 --> 46:50.140
Did you find a wee toy?

46:50.207 --> 46:51.875
I've got quite a collection
in my bag.

46:51.975 --> 46:54.278
It's kinda my thing,
innit? [grunts]

46:55.012 --> 46:56.280
[squelching]

46:59.983 --> 47:01.618
[Cliff] What the fuck?

47:01.685 --> 47:04.354
Charles. That stung.

47:06.190 --> 47:08.025
Good for you.

47:08.125 --> 47:10.460
[Charles yells, grunts]

47:12.863 --> 47:14.464
Oh, shit.

47:14.531 --> 47:17.067
We didn't come back
here to stay.

47:17.167 --> 47:20.003
We've got too many people
who need our help,

47:20.070 --> 47:22.406
and you can't make us.

47:22.506 --> 47:24.908
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

47:25.008 --> 47:27.711
So you can take
your bed check and fuck off.

47:29.880 --> 47:33.150
[laughing maniacally]

47:33.217 --> 47:34.551
[Monster Man] All of you, go!

47:35.152 --> 47:36.253
Mindy.

47:38.555 --> 47:39.823
You don't remember me.

47:41.725 --> 47:43.493
It's okay.

47:43.560 --> 47:44.928
Never let them see you sweat.

47:47.331 --> 47:48.498
Get out of here.

47:50.334 --> 47:51.535
[yelling]

47:54.571 --> 47:56.006
She can do whatever
she bleeding wants to.

47:56.073 --> 47:57.441
We need to get
to the river. Now.

47:57.541 --> 47:59.576
[Cliff] Fuck that.
We fucked up those freaks

47:59.676 --> 48:01.845
with the glow-in-the-dark
testicle thingies,

48:01.912 --> 48:04.748
we'll fuck up that
face-like-a-spider
woman, too!

48:04.848 --> 48:05.716
Go!

48:10.420 --> 48:12.522
-Who is that guy?
-I have no idea.

48:17.694 --> 48:19.062
[Monster Man screaming]

48:30.641 --> 48:32.442
[Watchers gurgling]

48:39.883 --> 48:40.817
Uh-oh.

48:42.920 --> 48:44.454
[shrieks]

48:47.424 --> 48:50.460
[Cliff] Spin on this,
weird spider-face lady!

48:51.929 --> 48:53.630
[retching]

49:03.740 --> 49:06.610
-[Cliff] What the fuck?
-[all exclaim]

49:09.780 --> 49:11.181
[woman groans]

49:16.954 --> 49:18.789
[Rita] It's just vomit.

49:20.624 --> 49:22.192
[all cheering, laughing]

49:30.367 --> 49:32.836
[all speaking indistinctly,
muffled]

49:36.206 --> 49:37.374
Look.

49:45.182 --> 49:46.550
[Cliff grunting]

49:53.623 --> 49:56.560
You know, in all
the afterlife excitement,

49:56.660 --> 49:59.329
I never asked you about space.

49:59.396 --> 50:01.064
Surprised you're back so soon.

50:01.999 --> 50:03.400
[Larry] Yeah, so am I.

50:04.835 --> 50:06.870
Let's just say
it was an experience.

50:07.838 --> 50:09.039
But I'm back.

50:10.507 --> 50:11.975
Minus a passenger.

50:12.843 --> 50:13.977
Oh, Larry.

50:15.512 --> 50:16.646
Are you okay?

50:17.647 --> 50:18.715
[Larry] I will be.

50:19.850 --> 50:21.651
Thank you.

50:21.718 --> 50:25.589
Oh, hey, who was that guy
that tried to save us
in the afterlife?

50:25.689 --> 50:27.090
An old friend?

50:27.190 --> 50:29.926
-Not a clue.
-[Larry] Huh.

50:31.695 --> 50:33.196
Maybe he had the wrong Rita.

50:44.374 --> 50:46.109
Maybe.

50:46.209 --> 50:47.944
[Jane] Your dad shot a pegasus?

50:48.678 --> 50:50.347
That's like,

50:50.414 --> 50:54.351
worse than shooting
a unicorn by magnitudes
of billions.

50:56.353 --> 50:57.621
[Cliff] I think I need help.

50:59.389 --> 51:00.891
I'm gonna make it out of here.

51:02.225 --> 51:03.727
With the living.

51:06.863 --> 51:07.898
Me too.

51:10.400 --> 51:11.635
[computer pings]

51:17.240 --> 51:18.942
-[Vic] I didn't ask--
-Eat.

51:19.042 --> 51:20.477
We all need our strength.

51:22.446 --> 51:25.715
Everybody,
I have an announcement.

51:27.918 --> 51:30.153
I'm truly glad you're all safe,

51:30.253 --> 51:33.457
and you're the closest thing
to a family I've ever
really had--

51:33.557 --> 51:34.724
But she's leaving.

51:35.559 --> 51:38.161
Losers. [chuckles]

51:38.261 --> 51:42.666
They're right. I am.
But just for a while.

51:43.600 --> 51:46.236
I need to find a few things.

51:46.303 --> 51:49.940
[Larry] Well, um,
we hope you find
what you're looking for.

51:51.608 --> 51:53.944
That was patently
for all of us.

51:54.010 --> 51:56.613
Subtlety is really not
your strong suit.

51:56.680 --> 51:58.949
[Charles] What, are you
and goggles pals now?

51:59.015 --> 52:00.517
Guess you're
a lot alike, really.

52:00.617 --> 52:03.120
All severe and moody
and pessimistic.

52:03.186 --> 52:05.655
Maybe we are.
Bugger off, Charles.

52:10.760 --> 52:12.696
[Cliff] Have fun, you kids.

52:12.796 --> 52:15.198
Don't worry about us.
We're great.

52:28.211 --> 52:30.213
[woman humming tune]

52:49.032 --> 52:53.203
Um, who in the sweet
mercy of fuck are you?

52:55.906 --> 52:59.176
Hmm, good question.

53:02.879 --> 53:04.681
Now, who would like some tea?
