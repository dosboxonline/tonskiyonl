WEBVTT

00:42.543 --> 00:43.669
Okay.

00:48.215 --> 00:50.008
We should say it out loud.

00:50.759 --> 00:51.760
Okay.

00:54.096 --> 00:59.852
I'm feeling safe and happy...

01:02.187 --> 01:03.272
And warm.

01:05.691 --> 01:07.359
And I just wanna go home.

02:25.812 --> 02:28.232
How were you actually feeling
when you opened that door?

02:30.150 --> 02:33.070
I was feeling overwhelmed.

02:34.196 --> 02:37.449
The pressure-- Fuck.

02:37.449 --> 02:38.534
I get it.

02:39.493 --> 02:42.704
I get it. All right, let's move on.

02:42.704 --> 02:44.248
You pick the next door.

02:45.374 --> 02:49.378
No. I'm not picking anything right now,
and neither are you.

02:49.378 --> 02:50.462
Look at me.

02:51.213 --> 02:54.591
- We need to wait this out.
- That's a waste of two ampoules.

02:54.591 --> 02:56.718
No. No.

02:56.718 --> 03:01.390
Taking time to emotionally regulate
ourselves is a calculated investment

03:01.390 --> 03:03.934
in both of us continuing to live.

03:03.934 --> 03:07.187
You can't lie to this thing. It knows.

04:35.859 --> 04:36.860
L.

04:37.694 --> 04:40.239
- O.
- S.

04:42.658 --> 04:43.492
E.

04:44.201 --> 04:45.619
Jesus Christ.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.501
I was--
I thought you were going for "lost."

04:55.045 --> 04:57.339
How are you so good at this game?

05:00.717 --> 05:03.303
Every time my auntie
couldn't watch my brother and I,

05:03.303 --> 05:05.597
my mom would take us to work with her.

05:06.223 --> 05:10.143
There wasn't much to do,
so we played ghost.

05:14.690 --> 05:16.316
Were you close with your mom?

05:17.067 --> 05:18.068
Sort of.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.696
Wasn't easy being her daughter.

05:21.780 --> 05:25.117
She had undiagnosed bipolar disorder.

05:26.201 --> 05:27.327
Do you see her much?

05:29.079 --> 05:31.206
Yeah, she still lives in the city.

05:31.206 --> 05:33.458
When I used to wait for my mom,

05:34.668 --> 05:37.337
I used to hustle
for change from strangers.

05:37.921 --> 05:39.882
When she was doing chemo?

05:43.677 --> 05:47.306
I don't like that you know
so much about me.

05:50.142 --> 05:54.062
I don't like that you know
nothing about me.

05:57.191 --> 05:58.859
Why did you ask for change?

06:01.320 --> 06:04.198
There was a vending
machine at the hospital,

06:04.198 --> 06:08.368
and it had a candy in it that I didn't
know where to get anywhere else.

06:08.368 --> 06:11.413
And it was just so good.

06:12.080 --> 06:13.957
- Your mom wouldn't let you have it?
- Yeah.

06:13.957 --> 06:16.293
No, she'd let me, but just one.

06:17.211 --> 06:19.046
If I got change from strangers,

06:19.046 --> 06:21.507
I could have as many as I wanted,
and she didn't know.

06:22.174 --> 06:23.342
That's smart.

06:24.301 --> 06:25.385
What was the candy?

06:25.385 --> 06:30.390
It had a yellow wrapper with lots of
colors on it, like confetti.

06:31.558 --> 06:32.559
Butterfinger.

06:32.559 --> 06:33.560
No.

06:33.560 --> 06:34.645
Dots?

06:34.645 --> 06:35.646
No, definitely not.

06:35.646 --> 06:37.147
Peanut M&M's?

06:37.898 --> 06:42.402
No. I love that, but I can't have them
around 'cause Charlie has an allergy.

06:44.112 --> 06:45.989
- Dares?
- Dares?

06:47.157 --> 06:49.159
No, we don't have that in my world.

06:53.497 --> 06:58.252
Hey, who went through
before your Jason did?

06:59.461 --> 07:00.921
Her name was Blair.

07:01.588 --> 07:04.633
She was our lead engineer for the box.

07:06.051 --> 07:09.972
Yeah. She volunteered
the day it went online,

07:11.431 --> 07:12.766
then Jason,

07:13.517 --> 07:18.146
then two people we found through
our anonymous call for participants,

07:18.146 --> 07:20.232
Selam and Alex.

07:20.232 --> 07:21.859
Were you all close?

07:24.278 --> 07:25.279
Yeah.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.447
Well,

07:28.740 --> 07:32.452
maybe they found their dream worlds.

07:38.166 --> 07:39.084
S.

07:42.004 --> 07:43.005
T.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.279
Hey. Wake up.

08:09.615 --> 08:10.991
The drugs have worn off.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.368
We're back in the box.

08:19.208 --> 08:21.084
But what does it mean for this door?

08:21.668 --> 08:24.129
Do you think the world is already decided?

08:25.422 --> 08:28.675
Well, yeah, we're not in superposition
if the corridor is gone.

08:31.345 --> 08:34.722
So I guess the question is,
how did you sleep?

08:36.517 --> 08:37.351
Deeply.

08:37.351 --> 08:41.104
I don't remember dreaming,
but I feel better.

08:42.147 --> 08:43.148
Me too.

08:46.068 --> 08:47.277
I'm starving.

08:48.946 --> 08:50.906
So, do we open it?

08:52.115 --> 08:53.492
I guess we have to.

08:58.497 --> 08:59.790
Wait.

09:23.856 --> 09:25.190
Fuck this.

09:28.402 --> 09:29.528
Jason.

09:31.196 --> 09:32.447
There's no one here.

09:34.491 --> 09:36.577
I'm so hungry too.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.663
Let's just take a look.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.000
Leave the door open, just in case.

09:59.975 --> 10:01.518
I'm gonna check the elevator.

10:12.529 --> 10:13.906
Shit.

10:15.032 --> 10:18.118
- What?
- Commissary's locked.

10:19.077 --> 10:21.038
The elevator's not working.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.082
So, what would cause a lockdown like this?

10:24.082 --> 10:26.919
We had protocols in place
for certain scenarios.

10:26.919 --> 10:28.295
Like what?

10:28.921 --> 10:31.340
Someone from the outside trying to get in

10:32.716 --> 10:35.719
or something coming through the box.

10:54.029 --> 10:54.988
Hello?

11:11.129 --> 11:12.130
God.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.263
Let's go.

11:19.263 --> 11:20.180
Come on.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.265
Shit.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.103
I don't even wanna know
what happened here.

11:26.103 --> 11:27.396
Works for me.

11:29.022 --> 11:30.107
Wait.

11:31.316 --> 11:32.401
Wait. Hold on.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.834
Make a run on three, two--

11:49.459 --> 11:52.921
If you move, I start shooting. Hands.

11:57.134 --> 11:58.802
No fucking way.

12:04.057 --> 12:07.936
- Blair?
- Blair?

12:15.360 --> 12:16.612
Oh, my Go--

12:21.700 --> 12:23.660
You came looking for me.

12:24.620 --> 12:25.621
It's--

12:26.788 --> 12:29.041
- A little more complicated than that.
- I--

12:31.627 --> 12:36.256
So, the Jason I know kidnapped you
out of your world

12:37.299 --> 12:40.552
and then brought you to his so you could
have his life and he could have yours?

12:40.552 --> 12:42.513
That is the theory, yeah.

12:45.390 --> 12:47.392
Was that the whole
reason that he built the box?

12:47.392 --> 12:50.062
Just to get back to that
specific version of Daniela?

12:50.062 --> 12:51.021
I don't know.

12:52.898 --> 12:54.775
Wait, how do you know Blair?

12:54.775 --> 12:58.695
Hey, well, in my world, Blair,
I mean, you're friends with my wife.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.447
But we certainly don't work
together though.

13:00.447 --> 13:03.700
- What do I do?
- Well, you're a bioethics lawyer.

13:06.828 --> 13:08.205
What, does that shock you?

13:09.289 --> 13:11.542
I applied to law school out of college.

13:12.334 --> 13:15.254
Yeah, I got waitlisted at
a place I really wanted to attend,

13:15.254 --> 13:17.256
so I went into engineering instead.

13:29.852 --> 13:30.978
This is me.

13:49.246 --> 13:50.622
- Hungry?
- Very.

13:50.622 --> 13:52.457
- Yeah.
- All right.

13:56.461 --> 13:57.880
How'd you find me?

13:59.339 --> 14:00.757
I'm not sure.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.222
I was thinking about you in the box.

14:07.222 --> 14:09.183
Well, on the menu tonight, we have--

14:09.183 --> 14:10.976
Don't touch that. Don't. Plea--

14:11.643 --> 14:12.644
Sorry.

14:14.313 --> 14:19.943
We have chicken and dumplings,
lasagna with meat sauce, and chili mac.

14:19.943 --> 14:22.362
- Chicken and dumplings.
- Chicken and dumplings.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.705
How long have you been living here?

14:32.497 --> 14:33.498
Three months.

14:34.416 --> 14:35.959
So what happened?

14:37.586 --> 14:40.839
It was like this
when I arrived, except no power.

14:41.423 --> 14:46.053
But I did get
the emergency generators running.

14:46.053 --> 14:48.180
And I logged into the system

14:48.180 --> 14:50.641
and I found this.

14:57.606 --> 14:59.024
It happened a year ago.

15:00.609 --> 15:01.693
That's you.

15:03.529 --> 15:04.780
Some other version.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.044
What the fuck are those?

15:19.044 --> 15:22.130
This world is overrun
with whatever these are,

15:23.257 --> 15:25.676
with whatever this other
version of me brought back.

15:34.017 --> 15:35.561
Holy shit.

15:38.438 --> 15:39.523
What is it?

15:39.523 --> 15:41.567
What do you mean overrun?

15:42.067 --> 15:43.902
They multiply exponentially.

15:45.279 --> 15:46.655
So you've been up there.

15:47.406 --> 15:48.407
Supply runs.

15:49.783 --> 15:51.743
I wear a hazmat suit
over layers of clothing,

15:51.743 --> 15:53.787
and I've avoided the swarm so far.

15:56.373 --> 15:58.458
They attack and consume everything,

15:59.126 --> 16:01.295
so there's not much alive up there
anymore.

16:02.796 --> 16:04.965
I'm sorry, what the fuck
are you still doing here?

16:04.965 --> 16:07.885
This is Velocity.
There must be extra ampoules.

16:07.885 --> 16:10.762
Well, whoever survived the initial
attack took most of them and left.

16:10.762 --> 16:13.015
- We have ampoules.
- I have ampoules.

16:14.349 --> 16:15.684
You don't have to live like--

16:15.684 --> 16:18.604
No, I'm not going back in
that fucking box until I'm ready!

16:21.899 --> 16:22.983
Okay?

16:22.983 --> 16:25.068
- Okay.
- Okay?

16:25.819 --> 16:26.820
Okay.

16:29.448 --> 16:31.992
So, what's the craziest world you saw?

16:32.826 --> 16:37.289
This one door I stepped
out of had this incredible drought.

16:37.289 --> 16:39.750
Dusty. Scorching hot.

16:39.750 --> 16:42.586
Lake Michigan had turned
into basically a desert.

16:43.337 --> 16:45.047
People had broken off into gangs.

16:45.047 --> 16:48.592
They were driving around in
caravans of trucks and motorcycles,

16:48.592 --> 16:50.344
trying to kill each other. It was crazy.

16:50.344 --> 16:51.929
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.973
You just described the plot of <i>Mad Max.</i>

16:57.559 --> 17:00.229
- <i>Mad Max.</i> The movie?
- What are you talking about?

17:00.896 --> 17:02.231
You don't have <i>Mad Max</i> in your world?

17:02.856 --> 17:03.732
No.

17:05.943 --> 17:06.944
<i>Road Warrior,</i> huh?

17:06.944 --> 17:09.363
- <i>Beyond Thunderdome?</i> Tina Turner?
- Tina Turner?

17:09.363 --> 17:10.531
- Yeah.
- The singer?

17:10.531 --> 17:12.324
What, does she act in this world?

17:12.950 --> 17:14.284
Wow.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.996
- That's not funny.
- Good fucking with ya.

17:19.623 --> 17:20.624
Seriously.

17:21.290 --> 17:23.210
Why do you need my money, huh?

17:25.087 --> 17:28.549
Come on. Think about it.
You have the keys to the multiverse.

17:28.549 --> 17:30.509
You can go on an
alternate-reality bank-robbing spree.

17:30.509 --> 17:33.178
No. Currency is tracked by serial numbers.

17:33.178 --> 17:35.389
They vary from world to world.

17:35.389 --> 17:39.351
You cross over with large amounts of cash,
it could get flagged for counterfeit.

17:39.351 --> 17:41.144
Well, that's just boring.

17:41.144 --> 17:44.106
Hey, listen, you wanna be so careful.

17:44.106 --> 17:48.318
And think through every
single decision you make in there.

17:49.278 --> 17:51.196
That box can be a one-way door.

17:53.282 --> 17:55.242
Are you sure you want this?

17:55.242 --> 17:56.368
Yeah.

17:58.662 --> 18:00.163
Hundred percent.

18:18.515 --> 18:22.227
You know, when I was a kid and there was
a video game that I couldn't beat...

18:23.645 --> 18:25.105
I'd just get the cheat code.

18:26.940 --> 18:28.650
See, it's fun in the beginning, right?

18:28.650 --> 18:30.652
I'd just zoom through the levels.

18:32.946 --> 18:36.825
And eventually, predictably,
I'd get bored.

18:41.163 --> 18:43.707
My life has been like that
for as long as I can remember,

18:44.416 --> 18:49.004
using money, connections,
influence to get what I wanted.

18:49.880 --> 18:52.925
But this box, J, it is not boring.

18:52.925 --> 18:56.178
And it most certainly is something
that I cannot cheat, and I get that now.

18:57.095 --> 18:58.805
- So let's go.
- Hey, wait.

18:59.973 --> 19:01.558
How are you feeling in this moment?

19:02.601 --> 19:04.770
Right now? Excited.

19:05.854 --> 19:08.232
Remember, you always have to be honest

19:08.232 --> 19:12.402
when you're inside the box,
especially with yourself.

19:15.531 --> 19:16.740
I'm a little scared.

19:18.075 --> 19:18.909
That's okay.

19:21.745 --> 19:23.330
It'd be weird if you weren't.

19:42.766 --> 19:44.017
Thank you for this.

19:49.064 --> 19:51.608
I still don't understand
why you went into the box.

19:53.402 --> 19:56.238
To save this Jason.
Leighton would have killed him.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.115
But where are you trying to go?

19:58.115 --> 20:01.535
You think you're gonna stay in his world,
assuming you ever find it?

20:02.411 --> 20:05.497
I didn't even think about it.
I'm-- I've just been trying to survive.

20:05.497 --> 20:09.585
There might already be a you there,
and he has a family.

20:10.752 --> 20:12.754
Listen,
maybe you've already figured this out,

20:12.754 --> 20:15.841
but you aren't just homeless,
you are worldless.

20:17.217 --> 20:21.555
And the longer you stay in that box,
drifting from one fucked up place

20:21.555 --> 20:24.099
to the next,
the more you will start to crack.

20:24.683 --> 20:27.728
That's why I'm here,
'cause I was cracking.

20:29.980 --> 20:34.484
I know it feels like this all just
started, but time is not on your side.

20:34.484 --> 20:38.113
You have to start figuring out
what kind of world you wanna end up in.

20:39.406 --> 20:43.452
And you have to do what's best for you,
not him.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.340
I'm sorry I didn't prepare you better.

20:58.759 --> 21:00.385
It was my choice to go in.

21:00.886 --> 21:02.304
I wanted to go in.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.182
It's because of you
I've survived this long,

21:05.182 --> 21:09.811
so stop with this blaming-yourself shit.

21:16.443 --> 21:18.237
Come with us.

21:18.237 --> 21:20.989
We might be the last people you ever see.

21:20.989 --> 21:22.241
No.

21:23.867 --> 21:24.952
I'm fine.

21:26.578 --> 21:27.621
I'll be fine.

22:13.250 --> 22:14.251
Ready?

22:27.139 --> 22:29.641
- Hey. Yo.
- So...

22:30.809 --> 22:34.313
you can open doors
and walk in and out of worlds.

22:34.313 --> 22:35.939
Any conceivable world?

22:36.523 --> 22:40.819
No, we don't have access to
the entire breadth of the multiverse.

22:41.653 --> 22:42.654
All right.

22:43.322 --> 22:45.407
Okay, so worlds that--

22:45.407 --> 22:47.993
That are adjacent to ours somehow.

22:48.994 --> 22:52.581
Worlds that split off at
some point in the recent past,

22:53.332 --> 22:59.004
that are next door to ours,
that we exist in or existed in.

23:00.047 --> 23:03.050
- Okay, so worlds that we were born into.
- Exactly.

23:03.592 --> 23:07.054
But wait. What happens if the drug
wears off when I'm out the box?

23:07.638 --> 23:09.681
It'll still be there when you get back.

23:17.314 --> 23:21.902
So, you have the multiverse
at your fingertips.

23:22.903 --> 23:24.321
What would you like to see?

23:33.622 --> 23:36.041
Hey, I have something for you.

23:36.959 --> 23:39.378
All my notes from my
box travels are there.

23:40.796 --> 23:43.799
It's definitely not for the faint
of heart, but maybe it'll help.

23:44.842 --> 23:47.719
I'd give you some of my ampoules,
but I only have a few left.

23:51.265 --> 23:52.933
You sure you won't come?

23:53.934 --> 23:55.435
I'll leave when I'm ready.

24:01.608 --> 24:03.068
Take care of yourself.

24:13.745 --> 24:17.124
I know it seems like you can just focus
on a world you wanna see

24:17.124 --> 24:20.085
and connect to it,
but it takes so much more than that.

24:21.795 --> 24:23.630
Everything intrudes.

24:24.298 --> 24:28.677
Fear and stray thoughts,
subconscious desire.

24:30.929 --> 24:33.098
For all my training,
I could never control it.

25:00.250 --> 25:01.293
You okay?

25:04.171 --> 25:06.173
Her life is destroyed.

25:08.634 --> 25:10.594
Your life is destroyed.

25:11.345 --> 25:12.763
The other pilots.

25:17.893 --> 25:19.728
He knew how to come back.

25:20.604 --> 25:24.274
He could've helped all of us,
stopped the box pilots.

25:24.942 --> 25:27.069
He could've just helped...

25:28.070 --> 25:29.488
so much pain.

25:32.991 --> 25:34.117
I'm sorry.

25:39.498 --> 25:42.543
I just can't understand how he
could become this person.

25:48.006 --> 25:49.424
You didn't.

25:58.308 --> 26:00.394
Are you sure you're ready?

26:00.394 --> 26:02.145
I just wanna go.

26:05.899 --> 26:08.443
I think I know how he became that person.

26:10.654 --> 26:15.409
See, when Daniela told me that she was
pregnant, she was a little uncertain.

26:16.159 --> 26:19.162
I mean, she knew that
she really wanted to have children,

26:19.162 --> 26:22.833
but she wasn't sure about me,

26:22.833 --> 26:26.044
about building a life with someone
that just wouldn't be there all the time.

26:26.044 --> 26:30.716
So, I had to go home
and really think about it

26:30.716 --> 26:35.512
and just really consider,
"Could I give it all up

26:35.512 --> 26:37.306
to have a child with her?"

26:38.765 --> 26:43.854
Spent all night thinking about it,
and I swear I saw both paths.

26:46.481 --> 26:47.941
And in the end, I went to her

26:47.941 --> 26:51.695
and I convinced her that I was worthy
of her and the baby.

26:53.864 --> 26:56.116
And I just think if I hadn't
had done that...

26:58.368 --> 27:02.748
if I'd have given up the potential love
of my life for a scientific theory,

27:02.748 --> 27:06.543
I would have stopped at
absolutely nothing to make sure

27:06.543 --> 27:11.840
that I was correct
and that I had made the right choice.

27:13.467 --> 27:15.219
And he chose the other path.

27:15.802 --> 27:16.803
Yeah.

27:18.347 --> 27:22.684
And maybe he's thinking
that it wasn't worth the trade.

27:27.397 --> 27:28.398
Sorry.

27:30.984 --> 27:31.944
It's okay.

27:33.737 --> 27:35.948
It helps me make sense of it all.

27:41.495 --> 27:42.788
See what I mean?

27:42.788 --> 27:47.626
It's all about keeping your thoughts
and your subconscious intentions aligned.

27:50.128 --> 27:52.214
Come on. Let's go.

27:54.800 --> 27:58.136
Hey, let's go again.
I have an idea of a new world I wanna see.

27:58.679 --> 28:01.765
We only have about five minutes
left on this dose of the drug.

28:01.765 --> 28:03.433
I don't need that much time. I'm ready.

28:03.433 --> 28:06.770
Hey, I still gotta get us
back to our world.

28:06.770 --> 28:08.272
But you got more ampoules, right?

28:08.272 --> 28:09.731
Yeah, I got 12.

28:09.731 --> 28:12.192
But I'm gonna take us on
one more training session,

28:12.860 --> 28:14.820
and then I'm gonna leave you
with ten ampoules.

28:14.820 --> 28:16.530
But you can get more, right?

28:17.197 --> 28:19.449
Yeah-- In theory, yeah.

28:19.449 --> 28:21.493
I mean, I'm not a chemist.

28:21.493 --> 28:25.038
The whole process, it's costly
and takes a little time.

28:25.038 --> 28:26.123
Okay, listen.

28:26.123 --> 28:28.667
I'm just gonna throw this out there,
all right?

28:28.667 --> 28:30.335
When our training is done,

28:30.335 --> 28:33.589
I'll pay you a million dollars
for every ampoule you send me off with.

28:35.591 --> 28:37.426
Think about it, all right?

28:54.776 --> 28:57.237
Could you pass me
the field journal, please?

28:59.489 --> 29:01.200
I was thinking about what Blair said

29:01.200 --> 29:05.370
about how much focus it takes
to really control the box.

29:06.455 --> 29:09.374
I was thinking about how I get
my students to pay attention.

29:10.375 --> 29:12.920
When you write something down,
it's almost impossible

29:12.920 --> 29:14.880
not to put your full attention on it.

29:15.547 --> 29:18.258
You can't write one thing
and think another.

29:18.967 --> 29:19.968
Smart.

29:20.552 --> 29:23.889
So, instead of just thinking of the world
you want to see,

29:23.889 --> 29:25.766
- you're gonna write it down.
- Yeah.

30:12.938 --> 30:14.273
I think it worked.

30:14.815 --> 30:16.108
Really?

30:16.108 --> 30:18.110
I think it actually worked.

30:19.319 --> 30:20.404
I've--

30:21.405 --> 30:27.244
I think this is the place that your Jason
took me the night he abducted me.

30:29.162 --> 30:35.752
It was dark and I was drugged, but--
No, I've been in this room.

30:39.131 --> 30:42.551
There!

30:43.093 --> 30:47.181
When I was losing consciousness,
I sat right there!

30:48.765 --> 30:49.600
He asked me...

30:51.935 --> 30:54.229
if I was happy with my life.

30:55.189 --> 30:56.607
Are you sure this is it?

31:00.611 --> 31:01.945
This is my world.

31:04.781 --> 31:06.617
Hey, come on.

31:49.451 --> 31:50.744
Let's go back.

31:53.539 --> 31:55.040
I have to go see my home.

31:57.209 --> 32:00.921
How do we learn to control the box
if we don't explore where it takes us?

32:01.839 --> 32:02.756
Okay.

32:14.768 --> 32:15.686
Hey!

32:19.022 --> 32:20.023
Found one.

32:35.622 --> 32:36.832
I don't like this.

32:38.792 --> 32:40.627
Something is very wrong here.

33:11.950 --> 33:12.868
Please hurry.

33:38.101 --> 33:39.102
Daniela?

33:41.230 --> 33:42.272
Jason.

33:44.650 --> 33:45.734
What's happened?

33:46.985 --> 33:48.362
They carried you out.

33:49.905 --> 33:51.448
They told me you would die.

33:54.326 --> 33:55.786
I don't wanna get you sick.

34:10.384 --> 34:11.927
Where's Charlie?

34:16.431 --> 34:18.183
He's still up in his room.

34:19.393 --> 34:21.853
No one's come to take him yet.

34:24.648 --> 34:25.649
Jason!

34:28.610 --> 34:29.485
I--

34:32.906 --> 34:33.907
Hey!

34:36.534 --> 34:37.786
What are you doing outside?

34:39.955 --> 34:42.331
My wife's inside. She's really sick.

34:42.331 --> 34:44.126
My son is dead.

34:44.668 --> 34:46.587
Well, you've got the colors
properly displayed.

34:46.587 --> 34:48.797
Somebody'll be along to help you soon.

34:48.797 --> 34:50.549
- No.
- No, stay back.

34:50.549 --> 34:51.757
- She needs help now!
- Stay back.

34:51.757 --> 34:53.217
- Stay back.
- It's okay.

34:53.217 --> 34:55.179
I'm Dr. Springer. May I see her?

34:55.179 --> 34:56.597
Yeah, downstairs. Inside.

34:56.597 --> 34:58.348
- Jay, test them.
- Thank you.

34:58.348 --> 34:59.349
Hi, I'm Dr. Quayle.

34:59.349 --> 35:00.934
I'm gonna give you a rapid test.

35:00.934 --> 35:02.060
Give me your wrist.

35:07.566 --> 35:09.193
- You're negative.
- For what?

35:09.776 --> 35:11.111
- I need your wrist.
- Hey, seriously--

35:11.111 --> 35:13.655
- Stay right here. Stay here.
- She--

35:14.489 --> 35:15.991
You're clear as well.

35:18.368 --> 35:20.370
Doctor, can you get her to a hospital?

35:20.370 --> 35:23.665
All hospitals and triage centers
have been at capacity for weeks.

35:23.665 --> 35:26.418
And it wouldn't matter.
Once the eyes hemorrhage, the end is near.

35:26.418 --> 35:28.629
I don't know about you,
but I'd rather die in my own home

35:28.629 --> 35:31.048
than on a cot in a FEMA tent. I'm sorry.

35:31.048 --> 35:34.009
Hey, there's gotta be
something you can do. Please.

35:35.093 --> 35:37.221
Go grab this gentleman
some auto-injectors.

35:37.804 --> 35:39.264
Just fucking do it, Jay.

35:39.848 --> 35:42.601
The virus isn't airborne.
It spreads through body fluids.

35:42.601 --> 35:43.685
Don't touch her.

35:43.685 --> 35:45.312
She won't make it through the night.

35:47.314 --> 35:48.398
What is this?

35:48.899 --> 35:50.067
This is morphine.

35:50.067 --> 35:52.569
If you give her all five at once,
she'll slip away.

35:52.569 --> 35:55.072
Don't wait.
The last eight hours are brutal.

35:55.072 --> 35:56.031
Let's go.

36:07.960 --> 36:09.044
Jason.

36:10.128 --> 36:13.340
I've gotta-- She's my wife.

36:13.966 --> 36:17.010
- She's my wife.
- But in this world, she isn't.

36:19.096 --> 36:24.601
If you catch whatever she has, you will
never see your real wife ever again.

36:26.478 --> 36:27.813
This isn't your world.

36:29.106 --> 36:30.524
We don't belong here.

36:31.775 --> 36:32.818
Yeah.

36:40.534 --> 36:41.535
Fuck.

36:47.875 --> 36:49.168
They won't take me?

36:52.713 --> 36:54.006
No.

37:07.811 --> 37:09.229
They gave me these.

37:12.858 --> 37:14.359
To help me?

37:15.485 --> 37:16.862
To make it all end.

37:28.165 --> 37:29.208
Okay.

37:41.803 --> 37:44.014
But I missed you so much.

37:49.269 --> 37:50.646
I missed you too.

37:53.106 --> 37:54.274
But I'm here now.

38:19.049 --> 38:21.802
Do you remember that? That day?

38:22.553 --> 38:23.637
Yellowstone.

38:31.687 --> 38:33.522
We ate at that place.

38:33.522 --> 38:36.942
Charlie had the buffalo burger.

38:39.444 --> 38:40.821
Pretended to like it.

38:44.700 --> 38:45.701
And...

38:46.952 --> 38:50.831
there was that view from our table.

38:51.623 --> 38:52.749
The mountains.

38:53.667 --> 38:56.003
And the sun was setting behind them.

38:56.003 --> 39:00.632
And then after, we went outside.

39:01.258 --> 39:02.843
All the stars.

39:06.597 --> 39:08.515
That day was perfect.

39:16.356 --> 39:17.357
They all were...

39:21.069 --> 39:22.070
All of 'em.

41:15.225 --> 41:16.810
Sore all over.

41:18.437 --> 41:22.524
There's some good news: Test is negative.

41:26.612 --> 41:27.905
Are you okay?

41:32.117 --> 41:33.577
I just keep thinking about her...

41:34.995 --> 41:36.788
Charlie up in his room.

41:42.002 --> 41:43.045
Look,

41:44.338 --> 41:48.383
I know it's hard, but the question
you should be thinking about--

41:48.383 --> 41:53.597
we both should be thinking about--
is why did you bring us to that world?

41:57.351 --> 42:01.188
All I wrote was, "I want my family."

42:01.188 --> 42:03.565
But you carried baggage through the door.

42:03.565 --> 42:07.945
You carried your worst fear:
Not just losing your family,

42:07.945 --> 42:10.322
but losing them to illness.

42:10.948 --> 42:13.283
The same way you lost your mom.

42:14.868 --> 42:17.996
We were just talking about it
yesterday, remember?

42:18.580 --> 42:21.917
But why would I seek
out a world like that?

42:21.917 --> 42:27.089
Why do people marry versions of their
controlling mothers or absent fathers?

42:27.923 --> 42:32.219
To have a shot at fixing things as
an adult that hurt them as a child.

42:32.970 --> 42:35.305
Maybe it doesn't make
sense at a surface level,

42:36.139 --> 42:39.059
but the subconscious
marches to its own beat.

42:40.102 --> 42:44.398
I think that world taught us
a lot about how the box works.

43:09.840 --> 43:11.550
So far, so good.

43:14.720 --> 43:15.846
Let's see.

43:47.711 --> 43:49.004
It looks right.

43:49.004 --> 43:51.965
It's-- I mean, this might be it.

43:52.883 --> 43:53.759
What if it is?

44:09.983 --> 44:10.817
Hey.

44:13.028 --> 44:13.862
Hey.

44:13.862 --> 44:15.239
Are you going to bed?

44:17.157 --> 44:18.742
Been kind of a long day.

44:27.417 --> 44:29.044
I should go in alone.

44:30.128 --> 44:31.839
What are you gonna do if he's in there?

44:37.177 --> 44:38.387
Can I say something?

44:40.055 --> 44:41.056
Sure.

44:42.724 --> 44:44.309
I know what I did.

44:46.562 --> 44:51.900
I didn't talk to you
about Charlie's car or quitting Lakemont.

44:51.900 --> 44:53.902
Or the investor thing.

44:55.946 --> 44:59.366
Yeah,
you didn't talk to me about any of it.

45:01.201 --> 45:02.369
Yeah.

45:04.788 --> 45:08.333
And it was super weird

45:09.626 --> 45:11.795
when you missed our time by the tree.

45:12.880 --> 45:15.883
And you picked the car by yourself.

45:16.800 --> 45:19.052
I was just trying to surprise you both.

45:21.096 --> 45:22.097
I love you.

45:22.931 --> 45:25.475
I want you to live
the life you wanna live,

45:25.475 --> 45:27.686
but what does that mean?

45:28.437 --> 45:30.063
Really, where am I in that?

45:30.814 --> 45:31.815
You're everywhere.

45:31.815 --> 45:34.318
No, I'm not in these
decisions that you've made.

45:35.152 --> 45:38.530
And you know you can talk to me, right?

45:41.200 --> 45:43.410
You know you can talk to me
about anything.

45:45.120 --> 45:46.121
All right.

45:48.457 --> 45:49.791
What do you wanna know?

46:05.265 --> 46:06.850
Who's your investor?

46:08.560 --> 46:10.562
Do you remember Leighton Vance?

46:11.855 --> 46:13.315
From years ago?

46:14.441 --> 46:15.609
You have a deal with him?

46:15.609 --> 46:18.362
Yeah. Well, we're close.

46:24.701 --> 46:26.286
That means it's not real.

46:26.286 --> 46:28.413
Not 100%, no.

46:29.289 --> 46:31.208
Okay, what percent real is it?

46:31.208 --> 46:34.253
It's 85, 90.

46:34.253 --> 46:38.799
Just gotta close the deal, and when we do,
I mean, we're talking millions.

47:04.157 --> 47:05.784
- Where is he?
- Charlie!

47:05.784 --> 47:07.077
- Hey.
- Go next door!

47:07.077 --> 47:08.203
Where is he?

47:09.037 --> 47:10.122
Oh, shit.

47:10.956 --> 47:12.749
Honey, I can explain everything.

47:13.500 --> 47:16.378
Where-- Daniela!

47:16.378 --> 47:18.881
- Stay there!
- Daniela.

47:19.381 --> 47:20.424
- Hey, I'm--
- Stay there.

47:20.424 --> 47:22.843
I'm not gonna hurt you.
I'm-- The knife is f--

47:22.843 --> 47:25.637
- <i>911, what's your emergency?</i>
- I-- Daniela, it's me!

47:25.637 --> 47:27.181
Yes, it's my ex-husband.

47:27.181 --> 47:29.600
He's supposed to be in prison,
and he showed up at my house with a knife.

47:29.600 --> 47:31.685
- What?
- Daniela Vargas.

47:31.685 --> 47:32.853
44 Eleanor Street.

47:32.853 --> 47:34.104
Hey--

47:34.104 --> 47:36.106
No! No!

47:36.940 --> 47:38.025
Got him.

47:39.276 --> 47:40.110
Charlie.

47:41.195 --> 47:42.487
- No!
- Please. I'm--

47:42.487 --> 47:45.032
- I got it wrong.
- <i>Are you still there, ma'am?</i>

47:45.032 --> 47:47.075
- I'm gonna leave.
- Let him go.

47:47.075 --> 47:48.619
I'm gonna leave.

47:48.619 --> 47:49.870
Don't ever come back here.

47:49.870 --> 47:51.330
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.

47:51.330 --> 47:52.998
Do you understand me?

47:53.582 --> 47:54.458
Get out!

47:56.793 --> 47:57.794
I love you.

47:58.378 --> 47:59.379
I love you.

48:10.474 --> 48:12.351
- Was he inside?
- We gotta go.

48:12.351 --> 48:14.144
- What?
- The sirens are for me.

48:14.144 --> 48:15.229
- What?
- Come on.

48:15.229 --> 48:16.480
What happened?

48:22.277 --> 48:23.278
Fuck.

48:23.278 --> 48:24.738
We need to get back to the box.

48:25.989 --> 48:28.325
I don't think it's safe
for us to catch the train.

48:29.493 --> 48:30.827
Cab?

48:30.827 --> 48:32.079
No, it's too risky.

48:32.079 --> 48:36.083
What we need is a friend,
someone in this world that we can trust.

48:41.129 --> 48:42.130
Come on.

48:42.923 --> 48:43.924
Who?

49:01.441 --> 49:02.401
Car keys.

49:31.638 --> 49:32.639
Amanda.

49:33.348 --> 49:34.349
Hey.

49:36.476 --> 49:37.519
Hi.

49:38.812 --> 49:41.982
You might wanna just
give her a hug and leave.

50:30.781 --> 50:31.782
Okay.

50:49.258 --> 50:51.260
That was so fucked up.

50:55.222 --> 50:56.557
What did you say to her?

50:59.935 --> 51:02.354
I told her that I'm in a good place,

51:02.354 --> 51:06.024
that I'm happy and that I miss her.

51:09.069 --> 51:10.988
Well, you gave her hope.

51:10.988 --> 51:13.240
- You think so?
- Yeah.

51:14.449 --> 51:16.785
And then you stole her car.

51:21.665 --> 51:22.916
Shit.

51:31.466 --> 51:34.261
Aren't you curious
about what you did in this world?

51:35.053 --> 51:36.471
I would be.

51:36.471 --> 51:37.598
Not remotely.

51:39.183 --> 51:40.434
Really?

51:41.518 --> 51:43.687
You're not curious
about what you're capable of?

51:43.687 --> 51:46.356
I'm terrified of what I'm capable of.

51:47.691 --> 51:50.611
Guess that's something I forgot
to write down for this world, huh?

51:56.158 --> 51:57.951
Look at you.

51:57.951 --> 51:59.369
What?

52:00.537 --> 52:01.622
We're learning.

52:56.009 --> 52:57.094
Dr. Dessen?

52:59.221 --> 53:01.390
Doctor? Is that really you?

53:03.183 --> 53:04.351
What happened, Mara?

53:04.351 --> 53:05.936
Another Jason came here.

53:05.936 --> 53:10.107
Amanda went with him into the box,
and then Leighton followed.

53:10.649 --> 53:12.568
And when-- How long ago?

53:12.568 --> 53:15.737
- Several days.
- Whose blood is this?

53:15.737 --> 53:16.822
Dawn's.

53:20.826 --> 53:22.244
Go back to work, Mara.

53:22.828 --> 53:24.413
What's it like in there?

53:26.331 --> 53:27.541
It's hell.

53:40.220 --> 53:41.221
Hey!

53:42.139 --> 53:43.432
You went in without me?

53:46.310 --> 53:48.604
- Just running an errand.
- All right.

53:49.313 --> 53:50.355
How many did you get?

53:53.567 --> 53:54.568
Fifty.

53:55.527 --> 53:56.820
You got 50?

54:00.574 --> 54:01.658
All right, listen.

54:01.658 --> 54:05.412
Okay, after you train me up,
send me off, then what?

54:06.830 --> 54:08.999
Then you're on your own, my friend.

54:10.250 --> 54:12.127
No. I meant what's next for you?

54:16.381 --> 54:18.258
I have to seal up the box.

54:22.804 --> 54:23.972
Don't worry.

54:26.850 --> 54:28.477
Only in this world.
