WEBVTT

00:05.088 --> 00:10.093
My dad was the first to be told
the truth about what they found.

00:10.135 --> 00:12.721
-MAN: Big shoes to fill.
-MAN 2: He was buried
five months ago.

00:12.762 --> 00:15.849
-How was this even possible?
-MAN 3: We’re looking into it,
Harris.

00:15.890 --> 00:19.686
BRYAN: That story that you
shared in the plane,
it stuck with me.

00:19.728 --> 00:22.355
Why are you asking me
about my father, Bryan?

00:22.397 --> 00:25.025
Because your father’s alive.

00:25.066 --> 00:27.110
BRYAN:
What are you not telling me?

00:27.152 --> 00:28.611
FINOLA: Something is going on

00:28.653 --> 00:30.155
that both of us don’t
understand.

00:30.196 --> 00:32.032
I need to know
if I can trust you.

00:32.073 --> 00:34.743
FINOLA: You can.

00:35.744 --> 00:37.704
LINDA: Do you see it?

00:37.746 --> 00:40.290
No.

00:40.331 --> 00:42.208
I told them we’d be
on the ferry by nine.

00:42.250 --> 00:45.712
I’m not gonna stress out
because your father has
to micromanage

00:45.754 --> 00:47.213
every single thing, Linda.

00:47.255 --> 00:50.967
I guess I ruined that
the ferries are on time.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.719
LINDA: What?

00:52.761 --> 00:56.222
Just text him and tell him
the ferries are off schedule.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.059
MAN (on speaker):
Excuse me, folks.

00:59.100 --> 01:00.560
Sorry for the delay.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.103
The ferry’s
about 15 minutes out.

01:05.357 --> 01:06.816
(phone chimes)

01:22.791 --> 01:25.794
No. No.

02:18.596 --> 02:21.808
-(gunshot)
-(gulls squawking)

02:23.018 --> 02:24.894
* (theme)

03:07.479 --> 03:09.856
-Kenny, good to see you.
-Brian.

03:09.898 --> 03:11.399
Hey.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.985
MADDOX: Have a seat.
I need to get you up to speed.

03:14.027 --> 03:17.739
His name is Anson Ash.

03:19.741 --> 03:21.701
Ex-SAS.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.870
Long history
of recovery experience.

03:23.912 --> 03:27.874
British Intelligence says
he went AWOL six years ago.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.043
He was a decorated soldier

03:30.085 --> 03:32.462
and then became an issue
for them.

03:32.504 --> 03:35.715
Have you got any more
clarity on INFLUX?

03:35.757 --> 03:37.050
Where it started?

03:37.092 --> 03:39.260
Anti-government
ideological movement

03:39.302 --> 03:44.182
organized to dismantle
the government’s control
over the Debris.

03:44.224 --> 03:45.850
So far, we don’t know
where they started,

03:45.892 --> 03:48.353
and we don’t know where
the dark money’s coming from.

03:48.395 --> 03:52.399
Largely, we think
they’re autonomous cells.

03:52.440 --> 03:55.276
I, um-- We got his phone...

03:57.278 --> 04:00.740
...but there’s some sort of
proprietary encryption on it.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.784
Have you ever seen anything
like that?

04:02.826 --> 04:05.412
-Calls keep coming into it.
-No.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.747
The caller’s coming
from somewhere in Maine.

04:07.789 --> 04:11.167
-What’s in Maine?
-Another operating cell...

04:11.209 --> 04:15.422
or an impending event.

04:15.463 --> 04:20.552
I need you to go
and investigate quietly.

04:20.593 --> 04:22.762
We wanna keep the lights off.

04:22.804 --> 04:27.058
At least then I can tell
how dark this thing is
we’re looking at.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.394
I don’t wanna lose any more
lives, Bryan, okay?

04:31.062 --> 04:34.441
Has Anson Ash revealed what
they wanted with George Jones?

04:34.482 --> 04:36.484
Not yet, but he will.

04:39.654 --> 04:41.406
What?

04:42.657 --> 04:45.827
I think Finola and MI6
know he’s alive.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.124
How?

04:51.166 --> 04:52.959
Just intuition.

04:53.001 --> 04:54.836
I’ve spent a lot of time
with her recently,

04:54.878 --> 04:56.504
and she’s acting differently.

04:57.922 --> 05:01.468
I just wanted you
to be aware,

05:01.509 --> 05:03.803
in case what I’m saying is true.

05:05.513 --> 05:07.891
Okay. Thanks.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.938
Hey.

05:13.980 --> 05:15.023
Hey.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.986
I got new briefing from Maine.

05:24.824 --> 05:28.328
Did Maddox get any more intel
about my father?

05:28.370 --> 05:31.164
No, not yet.

05:31.206 --> 05:34.334
Yeah, well, I think he’s just
going to hold on to whatever
he learns.

05:34.376 --> 05:37.295
If it is an INFLUX cell
out there,

05:37.337 --> 05:41.299
at least I’ll be able
to interview them myself
before Maddox,

05:41.341 --> 05:42.967
see what else I can find out.

05:44.469 --> 05:47.639
I told him you know
your father’s alive.

05:52.727 --> 05:55.855
-Why?
-I didn’t tell him I told you,

05:55.897 --> 05:59.651
but I can’t let him
be vulnerable to Ferris.

05:59.693 --> 06:01.611
He needed to know.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.157
Until there’s incontrovertible
evidence against him,

06:06.199 --> 06:08.535
I can’t accept
what you’ve been told.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.039
Okay.

06:14.416 --> 06:15.709
Hmm.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.263
AC-130s-- I spent way too many
hours in those things.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.265
-Hey, guys.
-Hey, Tom.

06:30.306 --> 06:33.351
-What do we got?
-We tracked the calls made
to Anson Ash’s phone.

06:33.393 --> 06:36.146
They were placed from a burner
purchased a local Best Buy.

06:36.187 --> 06:40.400
Purchaser was a Bar Harbor
resident with a long rap sheet.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.736
He killed himself this morning.

06:42.777 --> 06:45.613
Thing is he did it in front
of witnesses, but nobody
remembers anything.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.742
They say they don’t know
what happened.

06:50.452 --> 06:54.414
BRYAN: It looks like everyone
else is in some kind of trance.

06:54.456 --> 06:56.291
Hmm.

06:56.332 --> 06:58.960
TOM: She took that blue bag
he has with him.

07:00.920 --> 07:04.174
He’s fighting against something.

07:08.053 --> 07:11.264
We found the woman
wandering on a highway
six miles away.

07:11.306 --> 07:14.017
No bag or any Debris.
She doesn’t remember a thing.

07:14.059 --> 07:17.854
He was clicking out at 240
when he brought him in.

07:17.896 --> 07:19.606
Well...

07:19.647 --> 07:21.900
he was definitely
near Debris recently.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.151
New divorce,

07:23.193 --> 07:28.073
got into some small-time trouble
here in Maine,

07:28.114 --> 07:30.408
and he doesn’t even have
a passport.

07:30.450 --> 07:34.579
-So?
-Well, he doesn’t seem like
an ideological terrorist.

07:34.621 --> 07:37.207
Well, clear-skins
are usually chosen
by terrorist organizations

07:37.248 --> 07:38.917
for exactly that reason.

07:38.958 --> 07:40.460
they’re unremarkable,
they’re under the radar.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.128
Yeah, but he didn’t keep it
clean.

07:42.170 --> 07:44.798
I mean, there’s check kiting,
forgery,

07:44.839 --> 07:49.135
Liam Packard’s been committing
petty crimes since he was 15
years old.

07:49.177 --> 07:53.264
He and Anson Ash were
trading calls several times.
There had to be a reason.

07:53.306 --> 07:56.059
Yeah.

07:56.101 --> 08:00.105
Maybe he was part
of a sleeper cell.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.190
Maine is an easy hop
to the Canadian border.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.900
It’s right on the Atlantic.

08:03.942 --> 08:06.319
I mean, it’s the perfect spot
for Influx to set up.

08:06.361 --> 08:07.612
Let’s go check out his house.

08:19.624 --> 08:21.001
Stand by.

08:30.885 --> 08:33.680
-You Luke Packard?
-I am.

08:33.722 --> 08:38.143
FINOLA: Hey. We’ve come
to talk to you about
your brother Liam.

08:38.184 --> 08:41.646
That’s a lot of man power
for a dead man.

08:43.565 --> 08:44.691
Is it about the UFO?

08:44.733 --> 08:46.818
BRYAN: Why would you say that?

08:48.278 --> 08:51.156
Liam found some small pieces
of a strange metal

08:51.197 --> 08:53.700
out in the wash
behind our property.

08:53.742 --> 08:57.037
-When was that?
-A few weeks ago.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.622
There’s this group
on the Internet

08:59.664 --> 09:02.292
that tracks this sort of thing,

09:02.334 --> 09:05.545
like it’s some kind
of alien tech.

09:05.587 --> 09:09.883
Supposedly, pieces of
this spacecraft fall to Earth.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.843
Liam said this was
a part of it.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.428
And what did he do
with what he found?

09:13.470 --> 09:17.724
He was always chasing after
some get-rich-quick scheme.

09:17.766 --> 09:21.269
He was gonna sell it
to some people he met online
on the dark web.

09:23.938 --> 09:26.232
Do you know who
he was gonna sell it to?

09:26.274 --> 09:28.985
It was a black market
type of thing

09:29.027 --> 09:31.237
he said offered him
a lot of money.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.406
Like, 50 thousand dollars.

09:33.448 --> 09:36.368
He said he was on his way
to Winter Harbor this morning
to do it.

09:36.409 --> 09:39.996
To trade.
At least that’s what he said.

09:41.831 --> 09:46.753
Caroline, hey, sweetie,
can you--

09:46.795 --> 09:48.630
can you give us
a few minutes?

09:48.672 --> 09:51.341
I’m just talking
to my friends here.

09:54.344 --> 09:55.762
It’s okay.

10:04.938 --> 10:07.190
Caroline’s Liam’s daughter.

10:07.232 --> 10:09.984
I haven’t found a way
to tell her yet.

10:11.695 --> 10:16.408
Luke, is there anything else
that you can tell us

10:16.449 --> 10:18.618
about the metal that Liam found?

10:18.660 --> 10:22.747
Yeah. Yeah,
ever since he found it,
he’d been acting funny.

10:22.789 --> 10:25.125
Funny how?

10:25.166 --> 10:28.211
It made him intense.

10:28.253 --> 10:32.382
It reminded me what
I used to see when
I was in Afghanistan.

10:32.424 --> 10:35.385
Almost like he was suffering
from shellshock,

10:35.427 --> 10:38.722
only there was no shells.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.724
You know what I mean?

10:40.765 --> 10:46.688
He’d just stare at the walls
for hours.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.942
But then it’d pass,
and he’d go back to himself.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.029
I was in Afghanistan.

10:54.070 --> 10:55.655
Oh, yeah? What branch?

10:55.697 --> 10:58.324
Marines... MARSOC.

10:58.366 --> 11:01.911
Oh-ho! MARSOC?

11:03.538 --> 11:05.040
You guys were no joke.

11:08.043 --> 11:10.754
We should probably take
a look at his laptop,

11:10.795 --> 11:13.131
-if that’s okay.
-Yeah, sure.

11:13.173 --> 11:16.009
We’re also gonna need
to take a look at the marsh,
where Liam found the pieces.

11:16.051 --> 11:19.304
It’s right out back.
I’ll, uh, grab the laptop.

11:20.680 --> 11:24.184
(jet roars overhead)

11:29.314 --> 11:31.941
The guy fights to keep
from giving up a bag

11:31.983 --> 11:34.486
to a woman who doesn’t remember
what she did with it,

11:34.527 --> 11:36.029
and then he kills himself.

11:36.071 --> 11:39.949
He said his brother
was acting strange
after he found it.

11:39.991 --> 11:44.079
Maybe the Debris somehow
took control of them all.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.457
Like what happened
to me in Kansas.

11:50.293 --> 11:52.879
The Debris was in the bag
mind-controlling him.

11:52.921 --> 11:56.216
Hmm. And it’s still out there.

11:56.257 --> 11:57.967
We should get
some SAT scans going,

11:58.009 --> 12:00.929
see if we can pick anything up.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.056
I, uh, wrote down
the password for you.

12:03.098 --> 12:05.767
Oh. Okay. Thank you.

12:05.809 --> 12:10.438
You don’t have any experience
telling children of a loss,
do you?

12:13.983 --> 12:16.986
Uh, yeah, it’s, um...

12:17.028 --> 12:19.239
It’s not easy.

12:19.280 --> 12:23.118
But, um, no matter
what words are spoken,

12:23.159 --> 12:28.248
just-- just focus
on being there for her.

12:28.289 --> 12:30.458
That’s all that really matters.

12:30.500 --> 12:33.128
-Thanks.
-Yeah.

12:38.008 --> 12:39.884
Oh, wow, yeah,

12:39.926 --> 12:43.346
he definitely did frequent
all sorts of conspiracy
websites.

12:43.388 --> 12:46.599
There’s a lot of chat logs
in here.

12:46.641 --> 12:47.684
Like what?

12:47.726 --> 12:48.893
Just things

12:48.935 --> 12:53.023
that people heard, saw.

12:53.064 --> 12:55.108
Hey, what was
his reaction about?

12:55.150 --> 12:59.070
Luke.
When he heard what unit
you were involved with.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.615
Nothing.

13:02.657 --> 13:03.867
We were just both there.

13:14.419 --> 13:15.587
What?

13:17.797 --> 13:20.508
We never searched the marsh.

13:23.678 --> 13:25.889
How could we leave
without searching it?

13:32.854 --> 13:34.606
(Bryan whistles)

13:34.647 --> 13:37.317
(device beeps)

13:37.359 --> 13:40.987
390. I don’t wanna get
too close.

13:49.037 --> 13:51.289
I don’t wanna be here.

13:54.876 --> 13:56.252
You okay?

13:56.294 --> 13:59.422
I don’t think it wants us
to be here.

14:20.443 --> 14:21.695
-You okay?
-Mm-hmm.

14:23.321 --> 14:26.658
What was going on back there?

14:26.700 --> 14:29.577
It was like it spoke to me.

14:29.619 --> 14:32.956
But it was different

14:32.997 --> 14:34.749
to what I experienced in Kansas.

14:34.791 --> 14:37.877
This was more like a--

14:37.919 --> 14:41.131
a whisper in my ear.

14:45.802 --> 14:47.929
TECH BRANDT:
Hey, Bryan.

14:47.971 --> 14:50.098
You pick up any signatures
on where that bag of Debris
might’ve traveled?

14:50.140 --> 14:52.267
TECH BRANDT:
Nothing yet. Not a blip.

14:52.308 --> 14:54.769
BRYAN: All right, let’s get
that family to a hotel
for the night.

14:54.811 --> 14:58.690
Lock down the whole property
and dispatch the situation team
to the location.

14:58.732 --> 15:02.152
We’re gonna need a water unit,
so should give them a heads up.

15:02.193 --> 15:04.946
Got it.
Closest team is in Boston.

15:04.988 --> 15:06.573
Should be there by morning.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.491
Boston...

15:08.533 --> 15:12.537
Then drop me a pin on a good,
clean, hotel for the night...

15:12.579 --> 15:15.999
with a reasonably stocked
minibar.

15:16.041 --> 15:17.459
TECH BRANDT:
Copy that.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.655
(device powering up)

16:09.094 --> 16:11.262
(powering surging)

16:32.450 --> 16:36.246
MADDOX: You’re a soldier.
I respect that.

16:38.456 --> 16:41.418
It takes a certain, um...

16:41.459 --> 16:42.961
discipline, right?

16:43.003 --> 16:46.798
A certain, uh, ability
to endure, don’t you think?

16:48.383 --> 16:50.385
You know,
to have the career you’ve had,

16:50.427 --> 16:52.762
you must have
a very strong spirit.

16:54.514 --> 16:57.142
I’ve been called obstinate.

16:57.183 --> 16:59.102
(chuckles)
Yeah, me too.

16:59.144 --> 17:02.605
This new terrain that we’re
all in with this Debris,

17:02.647 --> 17:07.444
it’s not the first time
I’ve found myself
in uncharted regions.

17:07.485 --> 17:08.862
But I’ve always found it
comfortable

17:08.903 --> 17:13.158
to make my own way
in times of great duress.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.744
You may have even benefitted

17:15.785 --> 17:18.288
from some of my work

17:18.329 --> 17:20.915
in the war on terror.

17:20.957 --> 17:23.835
Some of the information
I pulled from terrorists

17:23.877 --> 17:27.797
I shared with the UK
when you were a soldier.

17:27.839 --> 17:31.676
It’s just Novocain.
It’s better if it’s numb.

17:58.995 --> 18:01.956
-(squelching)
-(wincing)

18:01.998 --> 18:04.959
MADDOX: Breathe. Breathe!

18:05.001 --> 18:08.922
That’s it. That’s it.

18:21.393 --> 18:23.019
You’re from Lancashire, right?

18:23.061 --> 18:25.021
(device beeping)

18:25.063 --> 18:26.523
Preston?

18:26.564 --> 18:27.524
You know I’ve been there?

18:27.565 --> 18:30.485
There’s a church there,

18:30.527 --> 18:33.863
if I remember, a beautiful,
beautiful church.

18:37.033 --> 18:39.244
Is it still there, that church?

18:43.039 --> 18:48.253
You know, I-- I always wanted
to do a painting of it in oils.

18:48.294 --> 18:51.256
-(electricity surging)
-(grunting)

18:56.761 --> 18:59.014
I want you to think
of the church.

18:59.055 --> 19:01.182
Just picture it.

19:01.224 --> 19:03.768
Think of the spire.

19:03.810 --> 19:08.857
Think of the-- of the way
the bell sounds in winter.

19:08.898 --> 19:10.900
(device powering down)

19:10.942 --> 19:12.402
The tone of that bell

19:12.444 --> 19:19.034
as it sends a vibration
right through your body.

19:19.075 --> 19:23.246
(panting)

19:23.288 --> 19:26.124
Now I want you to think
of George Jones.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.376
-(device power surging)
-(grunting)

19:36.634 --> 19:38.470
Maybe you just could just
pull up a chair to the buffet.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.096
It would be easier.

19:40.138 --> 19:43.099
I stayed up all night
watching the shopping network.

19:43.141 --> 19:46.311
Got a three-in-one
titanium strainer
for the kitchen.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.355
It’s definitely worth it,

19:48.396 --> 19:50.607
but I will be running off
sugar and coffee for
the rest of the day.

19:50.648 --> 19:53.068
FINOLA:
What? You couldn’t sleep?

19:53.109 --> 19:54.652
By an active military base?

19:56.112 --> 19:58.823
Tom told me
they got into Liam’s phone.

19:58.865 --> 20:01.368
The last number that Liam
dialed the day he died

20:01.409 --> 20:04.120
at the ferry slip
was not to INFLUX.

20:04.162 --> 20:06.623
-Who then?
-His ex-wife.

20:06.664 --> 20:09.876
Ten minutes before
he shot himself.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.884
Hi, Mrs. Hernandez?

20:17.926 --> 20:20.845
I’m Agent Finola Jones,
this is Agent Beneventi.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.681
Just wondering if we could
ask you a few questions

20:22.722 --> 20:25.934
about your ex-husband
and your daughter Caroline.

20:25.975 --> 20:28.561
We understand
that Liam contacted you

20:28.603 --> 20:30.772
the morning that he died.

20:30.814 --> 20:33.149
Can you tell us what
he was calling you about?

20:33.191 --> 20:36.861
He was upset. He told me
if something happened to him

20:36.903 --> 20:38.530
to go get Caroline
from his house.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.407
He was pleading with me.

20:40.448 --> 20:42.826
And then--
And what happened next?

20:42.867 --> 20:44.661
I told him no.

20:44.703 --> 20:46.871
How long were you divorced
from Liam?

20:46.913 --> 20:51.042
-Two years.
-Were you refused custody
of Caroline?

20:51.084 --> 20:53.670
No. I won custody.

20:53.712 --> 20:56.506
It was a long,
drawn-out court battle.

20:56.548 --> 20:59.759
But I fought like hell
for my daughter.

21:01.386 --> 21:03.930
She’s the most important thing
in the world to me.

21:03.972 --> 21:09.561
So why didn’t you go get
Caroline when Liam asked?

21:11.730 --> 21:13.732
Because she belongs there.

21:17.068 --> 21:20.488
What do you mean,
she belongs there?

21:23.908 --> 21:25.744
That’s where she belongs.

23:24.529 --> 23:26.239
-Luke?
-LUKE: What’s going on?

23:26.281 --> 23:28.324
-Where’s Caroline?
-She’s inside watching TV. Why?

23:35.206 --> 23:37.334
(man chattering on TV,
indistinct)

23:50.638 --> 23:54.017
Why didn’t you go to a hotel,
like we instructed?

23:55.226 --> 23:58.646
What’s-- I don’t remember that.

23:58.688 --> 24:00.357
What’s happening?

24:00.398 --> 24:02.359
BRYAN: We believe Caroline’s
involved

24:02.400 --> 24:03.735
with what your brother found.

24:21.836 --> 24:25.965
We think the material
in the marsh is controlling
people’s thoughts,

24:26.007 --> 24:27.926
trying to keep them away.

24:29.302 --> 24:30.303
(birds twittering)

24:32.389 --> 24:34.015
FINOLA: Caroline?

24:35.517 --> 24:38.978
Hi. Do you remember me?

24:39.020 --> 24:43.858
I came here yesterday
to talk to your Uncle Luke.

24:46.861 --> 24:51.282
I saw your mom today.

24:51.324 --> 24:54.327
I told her I was going
to check on you to make
sure that you’re okay.

24:59.124 --> 25:02.752
This is just like
a no-touch thermometer.

25:02.794 --> 25:04.504
Like the ones they use
at the doctors?

25:04.546 --> 25:05.880
See?

25:07.382 --> 25:08.383
Can I?

25:10.427 --> 25:11.469
Okay.

25:18.226 --> 25:20.270
MAN: I’m getting signatures
all over the marsh bed.

25:20.311 --> 25:21.646
There’s Debris everywhere
in here.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.189
I know there’s a lot going on,

25:23.231 --> 25:26.234
but they’re just looking
for something we think

25:26.276 --> 25:28.987
might have gotten lost
out there.

25:29.029 --> 25:31.281
And you know what I think?

25:31.322 --> 25:34.367
I think you know
what I’m talking about.

25:34.409 --> 25:36.536
Do you know what
your mom told me?

25:36.578 --> 25:39.456
She told me that you

25:39.497 --> 25:43.251
are the most important person
in the whole world.

25:45.587 --> 25:47.130
You miss your mom?

25:48.298 --> 25:50.008
Yeah.

25:53.219 --> 25:55.305
FINOLA: You don’t need to worry
about them, Caroline.

25:57.349 --> 25:58.892
You have to leave.

26:00.060 --> 26:01.519
You’ll be hurt.

26:01.561 --> 26:04.606
What do you think might hurt me?

26:04.647 --> 26:08.985
Is it the metal
that your dad found?

26:10.612 --> 26:13.823
Hey, I see how strong you are,

26:13.865 --> 26:17.660
trying to handle all of this
all by yourself.

26:17.702 --> 26:19.454
I’m here to help you now.

26:19.496 --> 26:22.874
You don’t have to be strong
alone anymore.

26:28.797 --> 26:32.217
I’m the one who has to get it.

26:32.258 --> 26:34.844
BRYAN: We’re concerned
about Caroline’s safety.

26:34.886 --> 26:36.429
About what it might do to her.

26:36.471 --> 26:38.598
Until we have this
under control,

26:38.640 --> 26:41.142
we think that you should collect
a few of her items,

26:41.184 --> 26:44.604
enough for a few days, and...

26:44.646 --> 26:47.607
and as soon as they get back,
we’ll get going.

26:47.649 --> 26:49.317
Okay. Of course.

26:53.029 --> 26:55.949
And do you know why
it comes to me?

26:55.990 --> 26:58.952
I don’t want it to,
but it does.

26:58.993 --> 27:00.870
Is it hurting you?

27:03.331 --> 27:06.251
He makes me get them for him,

27:06.292 --> 27:08.294
so he’ll have enough.

27:35.030 --> 27:37.532
I think he hurt my father.

27:37.574 --> 27:39.200
And he keeps my mom away.

27:51.296 --> 27:54.007
with his thoughts,

27:54.049 --> 27:55.842
but he’s not like me.

27:55.884 --> 27:59.179
He’s angry.

27:59.220 --> 28:03.058
We were used as cannon fodder
by bureaucrats

28:03.099 --> 28:05.435
pulling war levers
in Washington.

28:05.477 --> 28:11.107
You know, rich politicians
and their children don’t go
to war.

28:11.149 --> 28:12.317
But the he rest of us...

28:14.819 --> 28:16.363
It isn’t right.

28:16.404 --> 28:18.990
They are in control of the will
of us soldiers

28:19.032 --> 28:21.826
like we were machines.

28:21.868 --> 28:23.995
And all the while,

28:24.037 --> 28:27.248
they get no real blood
on their hands.

28:27.290 --> 28:32.295
Sometimes I hide pieces.

28:32.337 --> 28:36.800
But my uncle,
he always wants more,

28:36.841 --> 28:38.968
so he can get strong again.

28:39.010 --> 28:43.014
And they get used up fast.

28:44.849 --> 28:47.811
I need you to stop this, Luke,

28:47.852 --> 28:49.145
what you’re doing.

28:54.025 --> 28:56.152
My brother found them.

28:56.194 --> 29:00.907
But he didn’t care
what they can do,

29:00.949 --> 29:03.284
where the real power was.

29:03.326 --> 29:05.829
Well, what happened to him?

29:05.870 --> 29:08.373
I’m not gonna lie to you.

29:10.000 --> 29:14.421
What I did to him is gonna hurt
me for the rest of my life.

29:17.882 --> 29:19.509
And I gotta live with that.

29:22.387 --> 29:24.472
But he interfered
with the mission.

29:26.349 --> 29:30.520
And the mission
must be executed.

29:30.562 --> 29:32.355
What mission?

29:34.315 --> 29:36.693
You know the upper levels
of command,

29:36.735 --> 29:40.196
-the guys who decide
what happens to us pawns?
-Yeah.

29:40.238 --> 29:42.240
Well, a few of them are
meeting for a conference

29:42.282 --> 29:44.993
at an Air Force base
right near here,

29:45.035 --> 29:48.872
no doubt making plans to do to
others what they did to my unit.

29:48.913 --> 29:50.957
(plane roaring overhead)

29:50.999 --> 29:53.168
I’ll stop them.

29:55.086 --> 29:57.088
I don’t want to hurt Caroline.

30:00.091 --> 30:02.344
But I need her to find more.

30:02.385 --> 30:06.890
I know that you’re haunted
by regret,

30:06.931 --> 30:09.893
by what the military
put you through.

30:09.934 --> 30:13.313
They want us to be machines.

30:13.355 --> 30:15.857
I’ll give them one.

30:17.317 --> 30:19.611
And when I tell you
that I understand...

30:22.822 --> 30:24.115
...it’s not empty.

30:26.534 --> 30:31.122
When I was in Surabi,
I lost brothers.

30:31.164 --> 30:32.874
Destroyed families.

30:35.710 --> 30:37.921
There are people
that can help you get through

30:37.962 --> 30:40.298
what you’re going through
right now,

30:40.340 --> 30:42.217
like they helped me.

30:44.886 --> 30:49.474
There is a way to get back
from this pain.

30:52.352 --> 30:55.438
I was where you were,

30:55.480 --> 30:57.607
and that darkness
almost ended me.

31:02.904 --> 31:05.490
And then somebody
put out his hand.

31:08.368 --> 31:10.537
He was there for me.

31:10.578 --> 31:12.664
I wanna be there for you...

31:14.958 --> 31:16.167
...if you’ll let me.

31:27.387 --> 31:30.640
You should go find your partner.

32:00.545 --> 32:03.882
Bryan, Luke is the one
controlling the Debris.

32:06.051 --> 32:09.971
Agent Jones,
there’s nothing down there.

32:10.013 --> 32:11.222
We’ve checked everything.

32:15.185 --> 32:17.312
Okay, let’s get going.

32:18.897 --> 32:20.732
Let’s pack it up.

32:20.774 --> 32:25.362
-(doors slamming)
-(engines starting)

32:25.403 --> 32:29.199
Bye. It was nice to meet you.

32:29.240 --> 32:30.575
You have such pretty eyes.

33:01.648 --> 33:03.942
See what you did, Caroline?

33:07.946 --> 33:11.032
You made me waste too much
on them.

33:13.326 --> 33:14.703
I need more now.

33:16.454 --> 33:19.624
You keep telling me that
you’re not finding anything.

33:21.126 --> 33:23.086
But I know.

33:23.128 --> 33:25.714
I know that’s a lie.

33:25.755 --> 33:29.300
I know you’ve been hiding
what you found.

33:40.478 --> 33:42.313
How is it protecting you?

33:46.901 --> 33:47.986
Where are you hiding it?

33:50.321 --> 33:52.323
Where?

33:53.992 --> 33:54.993
Where?

33:59.372 --> 34:01.499
Good. Good girl.

35:12.070 --> 35:13.947
AGENT LI:
Tom and the team are back.

35:13.988 --> 35:15.281
They’re prepping to leave.

35:15.323 --> 35:17.701
Great.

35:17.742 --> 35:20.120
Tell him we’ll see him
back in Virginia.

35:20.161 --> 35:22.205
Hey, what happened
with that little girl?

35:22.247 --> 35:24.082
Caroline? She’s fine.

35:24.124 --> 35:25.709
She’s at the house
with her uncle.

35:25.750 --> 35:27.252
There was nothing there.

35:27.293 --> 35:28.670
What are you talking about?

35:28.712 --> 35:31.089
It’s all good.
She belongs there.

35:34.384 --> 35:35.635
Bryan.

35:38.638 --> 35:40.140
How did we get here?

36:47.582 --> 36:50.877
Luke! Stop! Stop, Luke!

36:50.919 --> 36:52.671
You can’t shoot me.

36:55.298 --> 36:58.259
Don’t move!
Now get on your knees!

37:04.974 --> 37:07.143
LUKE: So you’re with them now?

37:13.024 --> 37:15.026
I’m just getting started.

37:19.280 --> 37:21.324
Don’t listen to him.

37:21.366 --> 37:25.078
Walk away. Go on.

37:25.120 --> 37:29.374
I said go on, do it.

37:29.416 --> 37:32.168
Do it. Pull the trigger.

37:33.503 --> 37:34.754
Do it!

38:05.368 --> 38:06.995
(Finola gasps)

38:20.383 --> 38:21.843
Did you do that?

38:22.969 --> 38:24.846
Or was that the first time?

38:24.888 --> 38:26.848
He was gonna hurt you.

38:28.183 --> 38:31.019
It’s over now.
You did the right thing.

38:36.149 --> 38:38.485
GLORIA: I would never leave
you, Caroline.

38:38.526 --> 38:41.988
Do you understand?

38:42.030 --> 38:44.157
There are moments
when I would remember

38:44.199 --> 38:47.786
just how much I love you,

38:47.827 --> 38:49.829
that I had to come for you.

38:53.083 --> 38:57.420
But when I got to the house
to get you, it would be gone
again.

39:01.174 --> 39:03.968
I am so sorry.

39:05.970 --> 39:08.098
There was nothing you could do,

39:08.139 --> 39:10.225
no matter how hard you fought.

39:11.601 --> 39:13.478
What did this?

39:13.520 --> 39:15.313
What did he find?

39:15.355 --> 39:18.817
We’re still trying
to figure that out.

39:18.858 --> 39:22.987
But you... you were
the strongest of all.

39:25.281 --> 39:28.868
I’ll forever be grateful
that you saved our lives.

39:28.910 --> 39:30.245
Thank you.

39:37.252 --> 39:39.129
Bye, Caroline.

39:54.936 --> 39:58.565
-What’d you tell her?
-Nothing.

39:58.606 --> 40:00.108
(phone vibrating)

40:03.945 --> 40:06.406
It’s my sister. One second.

40:06.448 --> 40:09.242
-FINOLA: Hi, Dee Dee.
-Finola.

40:09.284 --> 40:11.661
Listen, I feel like
I’m in a downward spiral,

40:11.703 --> 40:13.747
and I need you to come home.

40:13.788 --> 40:15.415
Okay. What’s going on?

40:15.457 --> 40:18.293
DEE DEE: I just-- I feel like
I’m gonna relapse,

40:18.335 --> 40:21.463
and I just really need you
back here, like, seriously.

40:21.504 --> 40:25.091
FINOLA: Okay, okay.
Um, have you called
your sponsor?

40:25.133 --> 40:27.344
-No.
-Well, I need you
to do that now.

40:27.385 --> 40:29.929
-Okay, but please--
-Dee Dee.

40:29.971 --> 40:32.098
You need to call your sponsor.

40:32.140 --> 40:35.560
Your place is in London,
Finola, with me.

40:35.602 --> 40:38.355
You’re the only person
that could help.

40:38.396 --> 40:41.566
I was thinking we could go
to Michelle’s country house.

40:41.608 --> 40:43.401
Just the two of us.

40:46.446 --> 40:49.074
You wanna go
to Michelle’s country house?

40:49.115 --> 40:51.576
Something like that, yeah.

40:54.329 --> 40:55.872
Are you there?

40:55.914 --> 40:57.165
Yeah.

40:58.333 --> 41:00.001
Yeah, I’m--

41:01.127 --> 41:02.462
I’m still here.

41:02.504 --> 41:04.547
Well, nothing
would make me happier

41:04.589 --> 41:07.384
than to go to
Michelle’s country house,

41:07.425 --> 41:09.969
-but I can’t make it back
right now.
-(phone ringing)

41:10.011 --> 41:11.596
Yes, sir.

41:11.638 --> 41:13.223
MADDOX: Hey, so listen up.

41:13.264 --> 41:15.934
I just got done
interrogating Anson Ash.

41:15.975 --> 41:17.936
I need you and Finola
back here right away

41:17.977 --> 41:20.313
to prep for a raid.

41:20.355 --> 41:23.149
You’re going to
the Washington Scablands.

41:23.191 --> 41:25.276
I already spoke with Ferris.

41:25.318 --> 41:28.488
And I’m gonna do my best
to come back and see you, okay?

41:28.530 --> 41:29.989
DEE DEE: Promise?

41:30.031 --> 41:31.825
FINOLA: I promise.

41:31.866 --> 41:34.244
-I love you.
-I love you.

41:56.391 --> 41:57.475
Thank you.

42:01.146 --> 42:04.399
I just had the strangest call
with my sister.

42:06.026 --> 42:08.820
She used a code
from my childhood

42:08.862 --> 42:12.073
when our parents were around
and we didn’t want them
to hear us.

42:14.451 --> 42:17.412
It’s like she was trying
to tell me something
but couldn’t.

42:19.789 --> 42:21.249
What?

42:22.500 --> 42:24.169
What’s up?

42:25.587 --> 42:26.921
They found your father.

42:34.929 --> 42:39.559
MAN: Roger that. Approaching
Debris Field 56 now. Over.

42:39.601 --> 42:40.685
(beep)

42:48.151 --> 42:50.236
I see it.

42:50.278 --> 42:52.364
It appears to have a strange
shimmering wall near it.

42:52.405 --> 42:54.282
It’s undulating, and it--
