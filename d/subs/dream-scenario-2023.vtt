WEBVTT

01:38.968 --> 01:41.144
Dad, Dad.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.061
It's okay, sweetie.

01:48.978 --> 01:52.416
Dad, Dad. Dad, help me!

01:52.416 --> 01:54.157
Dad, please help me!

01:54.157 --> 01:55.854
Please help me, please!

01:56.812 --> 02:00.903
<i>And, um, I guess...</i>

02:00.903 --> 02:03.035
Yeah, and then I woke up.

02:03.035 --> 02:05.299
Why didn't I do anything?

02:05.299 --> 02:06.474
I don't know.

02:06.474 --> 02:08.824
It's like the third time now.

02:09.607 --> 02:13.698
Why am I always just
standing there?

02:13.698 --> 02:16.658
Don't make her feel guilty
about her dreams, Paul.

02:17.702 --> 02:19.313
You don't see me
that way, right?

02:19.313 --> 02:22.011
That's not how you think
I'd react in real life.

02:22.011 --> 02:23.708
If I was floating?

02:23.708 --> 02:25.580
Do you remember that time
you almost drowned?

02:25.580 --> 02:27.277
How fast I reacted.

02:27.277 --> 02:28.626
She was four.

02:28.626 --> 02:30.280
I remember you
telling me about it.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.413
Bye.
Hannah!

02:32.413 --> 02:34.458
Remember you have to
stay home with Sophie tonight.

02:34.458 --> 02:35.677
No, that's tomorrow night.

02:36.199 --> 02:38.680
No, the play is tonight.
It was always tonight.

02:38.680 --> 02:41.248
Really, she can't be alone
for, like, a few hours?

02:41.248 --> 02:42.336
I don't mind.

02:42.336 --> 02:43.772
You already
agreed to this.

02:44.468 --> 02:45.687
Okay, fine. Bye.

02:47.645 --> 02:49.386
So, should I just meet
you there, or...

02:49.386 --> 02:50.866
Yeah, probably.

02:50.866 --> 02:53.085
I'm not sure how long
it'll take with Sheila, so...

02:53.085 --> 02:55.175
- Are you nervous?
- No, not really.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.785
I... I think it'll be good.

02:56.785 --> 02:58.003
I think she'll understand,

02:58.003 --> 03:01.224
hopefully apologize
and that'll be that.

03:01.224 --> 03:02.791
Can you record it?

03:02.791 --> 03:04.184
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

03:04.184 --> 03:05.968
Just the audio
on your phone.

03:05.968 --> 03:07.361
I want to hear
how she reacts.

03:07.361 --> 03:09.580
Oh, wow.

03:09.580 --> 03:11.800
So vindictive, Janet.

03:13.018 --> 03:15.282
Yeah, I'll think about it.

03:15.282 --> 03:16.718
But you should go,
you're gonna be late.

03:16.718 --> 03:17.893
No, I'll be fine.

03:19.329 --> 03:21.331
- Have a good one.
You, too.

03:22.593 --> 03:26.293
<i>So, when talking about
adaptive strategies,</i>

03:26.728 --> 03:29.209
why does the zebra look
the way it does?

03:30.210 --> 03:31.820
You can spot it miles away,

03:31.820 --> 03:34.039
so it's not
very functional, right?

03:34.692 --> 03:37.608
Any theory on how
the black and white stripes

03:37.608 --> 03:38.914
could be a benefit?

03:41.656 --> 03:42.787
No one?

03:46.704 --> 03:49.316
From what we know,
the camouflage isn't effective

03:49.316 --> 03:51.883
in terms of blending in
with the environment.

03:51.883 --> 03:54.451
Rather, it's about
blending in with the herd.

03:54.451 --> 03:57.019
You see, predators need
to identify their prey.

03:57.019 --> 03:58.760
They can't just attack
the whole group.

03:59.935 --> 04:01.284
So, if you stick your head out,

04:01.284 --> 04:02.764
you make yourself a target.

04:02.764 --> 04:05.157
Yeah.
- Does that make sense?

04:06.550 --> 04:09.423
Hi. Hey, focus.

04:09.423 --> 04:11.686
- Is this how it went?
- No, it's different now.

04:11.686 --> 04:14.123
Do you want to share
your discussion with the class?

04:14.123 --> 04:15.559
Sorry. No.

04:15.559 --> 04:17.344
Okay, because you just made
yourselves a target

04:17.344 --> 04:18.780
by speaking when
you weren't supposed to.

04:18.780 --> 04:20.303
You get the analogy?

04:20.303 --> 04:21.435
I get the analogy.

04:21.435 --> 04:23.654
Okay, good.
So, in contrast,

04:23.654 --> 04:27.658
can anyone think of instances
where sticking out

04:27.658 --> 04:30.400
can be an evolutionary benefit?

04:30.400 --> 04:31.445
- Yes.
- Uh, mating?

04:31.445 --> 04:32.620
Mating.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.274
Welcome to Madre.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.277
Hi, I have a table, for Paul.

04:41.237 --> 04:42.717
What?

04:42.717 --> 04:44.414
I'm sorry,
don't I know you?

04:44.414 --> 04:45.720
I don't know, do you?

04:46.895 --> 04:48.592
Yeah, I...

04:48.592 --> 04:51.247
Well, Osler, maybe. I'm...
I'm a professor there.

04:51.247 --> 04:53.293
No.
No, I didn't go there.

04:53.293 --> 04:55.556
- Have you been with us lately?
- No.

04:55.556 --> 04:59.429
Yeah. Okay, uh, sorry.
I'm just...

04:59.429 --> 05:03.041
some major deja vu or...

05:03.041 --> 05:05.087
- Brian, right?
- Paul.

05:26.543 --> 05:28.676
Hi, Paul.

05:28.676 --> 05:30.373
Oh, it's so nice to see you.

05:30.373 --> 05:32.375
Yeah, it's been
too long, Sheila.

05:32.375 --> 05:34.725
I barely recognized you. Wow.

05:34.725 --> 05:36.553
Oh, yeah?
The beard maybe?

05:36.553 --> 05:40.078
No, it's the whole,
you know...

05:45.388 --> 05:46.955
So, how long are you
in town for?

05:46.955 --> 05:49.740
Just a few days,
visiting my brother.

05:49.740 --> 05:51.307
How's everything with you?

05:51.307 --> 05:54.354
- You're still at Osler, right?
- Yeah, I am.

05:58.183 --> 06:00.403
And you're publishing
another paper, I heard.

06:00.403 --> 06:04.189
Oh, yeah, uh,
we're just doing
final revisions now.

06:04.189 --> 06:05.452
So, it's... it's looking good.

06:05.452 --> 06:07.976
Where'd you end up?
Which publication?

06:07.976 --> 06:10.587
Uh, do you want to...
Should we look at the menu?

06:10.587 --> 06:12.807
Yeah.
Which publication, though?

06:12.807 --> 06:14.722
Uh, <i>Nature.</i>

06:14.722 --> 06:16.288
<i>Nature?</i>

06:16.288 --> 06:17.768
Yeah. We're happy about that.

06:17.768 --> 06:19.988
I mean, it's been
a while, so, yeah.

06:31.869 --> 06:33.697
<i>Why haven't
you contacted me?</i>

06:33.697 --> 06:35.525
<i>What?</i>
<i>Why am I not
being credited?</i>

06:35.525 --> 06:36.874
<i>What do you mean?</i>

06:36.874 --> 06:39.311
<i>Oh, come on,
swarm intelligence?</i>

06:39.311 --> 06:41.183
<i>Ant colony algorithms?</i>

06:41.183 --> 06:42.445
Yeah.

06:42.445 --> 06:44.534
Sounds awfully similar
to my research now.

06:44.534 --> 06:47.494
Well, I... Do you mean
from grad school?

06:47.494 --> 06:49.104
Yes. You weren't
even interested

06:49.104 --> 06:50.322
in networks back then.

06:50.322 --> 06:52.455
You were all about
senescence.

06:52.455 --> 06:55.066
Yes, I... I... I mean,
I've expanded my interests

06:55.066 --> 06:57.068
over the last 30 years.

06:57.068 --> 07:00.550
Are you using
"antelligence"? You know
I coined that, right?

07:00.550 --> 07:02.857
I'm not using
"antelligence."

07:02.857 --> 07:05.860
Look, there's a big difference
between talking about an idea

07:05.860 --> 07:07.818
and actually
doing all the work.

07:07.818 --> 07:10.952
No, no, I've been working.
I've got a book.

07:10.952 --> 07:14.477
Uh, do you have
a publisher?

07:14.477 --> 07:17.437
Well, I... I want to finish it
before I take it out.

07:17.437 --> 07:19.090
I don't want
to be influenced by

07:19.090 --> 07:20.744
any sort of corporate agenda.

07:20.744 --> 07:22.877
- Can I read a draft, or...
- Oh, why?

07:22.877 --> 07:25.749
- Do you need more material?
- Oh, come on, Paul.

07:25.749 --> 07:27.490
Let's be adults here.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.579
How far along are you?

07:29.579 --> 07:32.452
Well, I haven't really started
the actual sitting down

07:32.452 --> 07:34.889
and writing portion
of it yet, but...

07:34.889 --> 07:37.369
<i>So, this kind of ruins
everything for me, Sheila.</i>

07:37.369 --> 07:39.850
<i>It's just a complete
appropriation. I mean...</i>

07:40.982 --> 07:43.419
Can you at least
just credit me?

07:43.419 --> 07:46.161
There's nothing
wrong with just being
a professor, Paul.

07:46.161 --> 07:47.728
You don't need to be
a researcher, too.

07:49.730 --> 07:52.515
<i>Please, Sheila. I need this.</i>

08:19.150 --> 08:20.630
Paul.
- Jan.

08:20.630 --> 08:22.197
- Hi.
You got the tickets?

08:22.197 --> 08:24.025
Yeah. How'd it go?

08:24.025 --> 08:25.548
What, oh,
you mean with Sheila?

08:25.548 --> 08:26.854
Yeah.

08:26.854 --> 08:28.116
Yeah. Well, yeah,
you know, it's technical.

08:28.116 --> 08:29.726
I mean, she totally
saw my argument,

08:29.726 --> 08:32.033
but we didn't fully,
you know, resolve it yet.

08:32.033 --> 08:34.514
Really? So, what's next?

08:34.514 --> 08:35.689
I'll figure it out.

08:35.689 --> 08:37.473
Okay. Well, was she defensive?

08:37.473 --> 08:40.041
- Did you record it?
- No, no.

08:40.041 --> 08:44.524
It kind of felt, you know,
unethical or whatever.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.526
- You want to go inside?
- Yeah.

09:07.155 --> 09:09.549
Paul. Paul!

09:10.506 --> 09:12.943
Ah!
I thought that was you.

09:12.943 --> 09:14.466
- Claire?
- Yeah.

09:14.466 --> 09:16.294
Hi, my God.

09:16.294 --> 09:18.166
Oh, it's so good
to see you.

09:18.166 --> 09:19.776
You just saw the play?

09:19.776 --> 09:21.778
Duh, yeah. Of course.

09:21.778 --> 09:24.172
- This is my wife, Janet.
- Oh, hi.

09:24.172 --> 09:25.956
- Hi.
- I'm Claire.

09:25.956 --> 09:27.697
- Hello, Janet.
- When did you get married?

09:27.697 --> 09:30.700
Oh, wow. That's about,
well, let's see...

09:30.700 --> 09:33.181
- 15 years.
- Yeah, 15 years ago.

09:33.181 --> 09:35.183
I'm so glad I ran into you.

09:35.183 --> 09:36.924
You've been on my mind
a lot lately.

09:36.924 --> 09:38.839
I'm sorry. How do you
two know each other?

09:38.839 --> 09:41.668
Oh, well,
Claire and I used to date.

09:41.668 --> 09:43.278
Yeah.

09:43.278 --> 09:45.280
- Wild right?

09:45.280 --> 09:47.587
Anyway, you've been on
my mind recently.

09:47.587 --> 09:51.765
Yeah? I, uh...
I haven't thought
about you in a while.

09:51.765 --> 09:55.377
Okay. Good to know, I guess.

09:55.377 --> 09:57.379
Anyway, the reason that
you've been on my mind

09:57.379 --> 09:59.381
is because you keep
popping up in my dreams.

09:59.947 --> 10:01.513
- Really?
Yeah.

10:01.513 --> 10:02.993
Like, a lot
in the last few weeks.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.082
It's so strange.

10:05.082 --> 10:06.910
You don't do anything.
You're just there,

10:06.910 --> 10:09.609
even if the dream's
completely unrelated to you.

10:10.131 --> 10:11.393
Like the other night,

10:11.393 --> 10:14.048
a good friend of mine
was lying in the street,

10:14.048 --> 10:17.486
<i>hit by a car, bleeding,
dying in my arms, right?</i>

10:17.486 --> 10:19.793
And then... this is just
in the dream, of course.

10:19.793 --> 10:22.143
<i>And out of nowhere,</i>

10:22.143 --> 10:25.102
<i>there you are,
just strolling by.</i>

10:28.236 --> 10:31.892
Wow. I'm... Well, I mean,
that is so strange.

10:31.892 --> 10:35.112
So, I don't intervene at all?
I... I don't help out?

10:35.112 --> 10:36.940
You're still doing that?

10:36.940 --> 10:39.247
- What?
Searching
for the insult.

10:39.943 --> 10:42.380
No, you don't do anything,
but it's not like I blame you.

10:42.380 --> 10:44.731
I was just gonna say
that my therapist

10:44.731 --> 10:46.123
suggested that I reach out.

10:46.123 --> 10:51.128
That maybe you and I
need to sort something out,

10:51.128 --> 10:52.564
you know, subconsciously.

10:52.564 --> 10:55.567
Did... did you know
he was here?

10:55.567 --> 10:58.440
No, no, no, I just happened
to see you guys,

10:58.440 --> 11:00.529
which feels like a sign,
you know, synchronicity.

11:00.529 --> 11:03.010
Okay. Okay. Yeah.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.925
Do you think we can grab
a coffee or something?

11:04.925 --> 11:06.883
You know,
just catch up and stuff?

11:07.579 --> 11:09.886
Yeah, we... we can do that.
Sure, why not?

11:09.886 --> 11:11.671
I mean, you know...

11:11.671 --> 11:13.585
Should I take
your number?

11:13.585 --> 11:14.674
Oh, uh...

11:15.849 --> 11:17.502
- Okay, yeah.
Okay.

11:17.502 --> 11:19.722
Put your number in there.

11:21.071 --> 11:23.944
- Did you like the play?
- I did, yeah. Yeah.

11:27.469 --> 11:28.905
What, you changed
your last name?

11:28.905 --> 11:31.125
Yeah, I took hers.
We thought it was...

11:31.125 --> 11:34.911
I thought it was appropriate.
I wanted to.

11:34.911 --> 11:36.173
Right.

11:36.173 --> 11:37.740
Why'd you get all red?

11:37.740 --> 11:40.221
Well, I was just taken aback
by the whole situation.

11:40.221 --> 11:42.136
Wouldn't you react the same

11:42.136 --> 11:45.095
if some old boyfriend
just cornered you like that?

11:45.095 --> 11:47.184
I don't think I'd turn
into a stuttering fool.

11:47.184 --> 11:48.838
I don't think
I was stuttering.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.448
She seemed
really happy to see you.

11:50.448 --> 11:53.669
Well, yeah, but not becau...
It's because of these dreams.

11:53.669 --> 11:55.366
Why are you
defending her?

11:55.366 --> 11:58.195
Are you just
trying to pick a fight
with me right now?

11:58.195 --> 12:00.981
No, I'm just nervous
what this woman will do to you

12:00.981 --> 12:03.635
- when I'm not there.
- Do to me?

12:03.635 --> 12:05.202
What's she gonna do to me?

12:07.204 --> 12:08.466
Jump me?

12:08.466 --> 12:11.208
Why did you ask if
she was married?

12:11.208 --> 12:14.690
I was
making conversation.

12:14.690 --> 12:17.693
Okay. Well, maybe
I'm exaggerating a little bit,

12:17.693 --> 12:20.652
but I would be lying if I said
I wasn't worried at all.

12:20.652 --> 12:22.045
That's fair.

12:23.220 --> 12:26.006
But I'm just meeting her
for coffee, that's it.

12:27.224 --> 12:28.530
I love you.

12:30.445 --> 12:33.491
Have you ever fantasized
about other women?

12:36.843 --> 12:38.975
Yeah, of course, I have.

12:38.975 --> 12:41.195
But never cheated?
- Oh, my God, Janet.

12:41.195 --> 12:42.674
Do you really think
I'm that cool?

12:42.674 --> 12:44.024
Do you think I could handle

12:44.024 --> 12:46.548
the emotional burden
of having an affair?

12:46.548 --> 12:49.029
- No. No, you're right.

12:49.029 --> 12:52.032
Just try not to let
your neuroticism hijack you.

12:52.032 --> 12:55.426
Oh, come on. Not the gender
psychology bullshit again.

12:55.426 --> 12:57.820
We both know you score high
in neuroticism.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.170
It's best to just own it
and be pragmatic about it.

13:00.170 --> 13:05.262
Yeah. Well, you score high in,
uh, in... "assholeness."

13:06.263 --> 13:08.222
I... I score high in
"assholeness"?

13:08.222 --> 13:11.703
Yeah. So, just own it.
Be pragmatic about it.

13:15.098 --> 13:16.491
How about this?

13:16.491 --> 13:19.276
I'll keep it very formal
when I meet her.

13:19.711 --> 13:21.148
I won't even smile.

13:22.323 --> 13:24.412
- She might like that.
-  What?

13:24.412 --> 13:25.761
- She might like that.
- Oh, no.

13:25.761 --> 13:27.241
Yeah, it's just so...

13:27.241 --> 13:29.069
Well, it's just
so intense, you know?

13:29.069 --> 13:31.201
And I usually don't even
remember my dreams.

13:31.201 --> 13:34.814
Wow. I... I feel like
I want to apologize

13:34.814 --> 13:37.599
for barging into
your head like that.

13:37.599 --> 13:40.863
No, it's okay.
It's just funny, you know?

13:40.863 --> 13:42.909
Anyway, thanks
for meeting me.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.258
Of course.

13:44.258 --> 13:46.564
Um, there's actually, um...

13:46.564 --> 13:47.827
there's something
I want to ask you.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.480
- Oh, yeah?
Mm-hmm.

13:49.480 --> 13:50.960
What?

13:50.960 --> 13:52.832
Would it be okay
if I wrote about this?

13:53.702 --> 13:55.660
What do you mean?
In... in what way?

13:55.660 --> 13:58.098
Well, I write for this magazine
called The New Inquiry.

13:58.098 --> 14:00.317
Really? You're publishing?

14:00.317 --> 14:01.710
It's just online.

14:01.710 --> 14:04.756
It's more like a blog.
Nobody really reads it.

14:04.756 --> 14:07.107
What... what sort of
stuff do you write about?

14:07.107 --> 14:09.457
Mostly psychology.
Jungian stuff.

14:09.457 --> 14:10.632
- Oh.
Yeah, okay.

14:10.632 --> 14:11.981
I knew you'd scoff at that.

14:11.981 --> 14:13.896
Sorry,
I didn't mean to.

14:13.896 --> 14:16.072
What, you want
to write about me?

14:16.072 --> 14:18.379
No, I want to write
about the dreams.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.685
About randomly
seeing you, just that.

14:20.685 --> 14:23.166
It's just... it's just very
on brand from what I do.

14:23.166 --> 14:25.821
I mean, yeah,
if you don't portray me

14:25.821 --> 14:29.477
as this inadequate loser,
like in your dreams.

14:29.477 --> 14:30.957
You're
seriously insulted.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.916
No, of course not.
I'm joking.

14:34.482 --> 14:35.613
So, you'd be okay
with it?

14:35.613 --> 14:38.268
- Yes. Yeah. Go ahead.
- Yes.

14:38.268 --> 14:39.835
Thank you. Yes.

14:45.580 --> 14:47.364
- What?
No, it's...

14:47.364 --> 14:52.413
just my wife suspected
you had ulterior motives.

14:52.413 --> 14:53.980
Like what?

14:53.980 --> 14:57.722
Well, that you still
had feelings for me,

14:57.722 --> 14:59.811
that you missed me.

14:59.811 --> 15:01.944
Wait... really?

15:01.944 --> 15:04.512
That's so funny.
Why would she say that?

15:04.512 --> 15:07.558
Oh, I... I mean,
I don't know, I...

15:07.558 --> 15:10.300
Oh, shoot, I have to run.

15:10.300 --> 15:12.999
Um, well, thank you.

15:12.999 --> 15:15.436
- Thanks for doing this, really.
- Sure.

15:16.785 --> 15:20.397
I guess I'll, uh... I guess
I'll see you in my dreams.

15:20.397 --> 15:23.531
Yeah, of course not.

15:24.227 --> 15:25.402
Thanks.

15:29.754 --> 15:31.147
Is it him?

15:31.147 --> 15:33.106
It's Paul for sure.
That's so weird.

15:33.106 --> 15:34.759
We're basically
having the same dream.

15:34.759 --> 15:36.544
I know, it's so
random. It's just, like,

15:36.544 --> 15:39.155
Paul, every night
for some reason.

15:39.155 --> 15:41.027
Hi.
- Hey.

15:41.027 --> 15:42.376
You guys good?

15:42.376 --> 15:43.899
Yeah. You?
- Yeah.

15:48.556 --> 15:49.992
So amazing.

15:58.914 --> 16:00.046
What?

16:00.046 --> 16:01.438
Have you been
dreaming about me?

16:01.438 --> 16:03.136
Have I been
dreaming about you?

16:03.136 --> 16:04.398
Yeah.

16:05.138 --> 16:06.661
Ever in my life, you mean?

16:06.661 --> 16:08.837
No, recently.

16:08.837 --> 16:11.361
I don't know. I don't keep
track of things like that.

16:13.842 --> 16:16.018
You're kind of freaking me out.
What's going on?

16:16.410 --> 16:17.454
Nothing.

16:20.414 --> 16:22.503
Can we please put
our phones away

16:22.503 --> 16:24.244
and have
a real conversation?

16:26.507 --> 16:29.510
So, how was school today,
Sophie?

16:31.860 --> 16:33.383
- Dad.
- It's fine,

16:33.383 --> 16:34.602
I'll call them back later.

16:34.602 --> 16:35.907
Tell me about your day.

16:35.907 --> 16:37.431
Can you turn
the sound off at least?

16:37.431 --> 16:38.954
Yes, I'll do that next time.

16:38.954 --> 16:40.216
It'll stop soon.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.307
Sophie, didn't you guys decide

16:44.307 --> 16:46.092
which character
you're going to be

16:46.092 --> 16:47.789
- for the... for the play or...
- Yeah.

16:50.661 --> 16:51.836
Let me just hang up.

16:54.404 --> 16:56.058
I have to take this.

16:56.058 --> 16:58.930
- That's not allowed.
- Richard, hi.

16:58.930 --> 17:01.063
<i>Is this a good time?
You have a minute?</i>

17:01.063 --> 17:03.022
Yeah. What's going on?

17:03.022 --> 17:05.676
<i>So, uh, where do I start?</i>

17:05.676 --> 17:07.461
Oh, wow. It sounds serious.

17:07.461 --> 17:09.202
<i>No, it's funny.</i>

17:09.202 --> 17:12.248
<i>You know sometimes I have
these dinner parties, right?</i>

17:12.248 --> 17:14.946
Yeah. Is this finally
the invite?

17:14.946 --> 17:17.688
<i>No, it's, uh...
I just had one.</i>

17:17.949 --> 17:20.430
Oh, okay, and?

17:20.430 --> 17:23.085
- So, I've told my husband
this ad nauseam,

17:23.085 --> 17:25.392
but it's about
a recurring dream I've had,

17:25.392 --> 17:27.089
or not so much
a specific dream

17:27.089 --> 17:29.178
but a specific person
I keep dreaming about.

17:29.178 --> 17:32.138
He looks perfectly average.

17:32.138 --> 17:35.489
He's a remarkable nobody
that just shows up.

17:35.489 --> 17:39.145
He just occupies the space
like an awkward guest

17:39.145 --> 17:41.364
at a party
that no one really knows.

17:41.364 --> 17:42.496
You mean like Sydney?

17:42.496 --> 17:45.194
- Yeah.

17:45.194 --> 17:47.196
No, I mean...

17:47.196 --> 17:50.417
I have also... I've...
I've also had that experience.

17:50.417 --> 17:51.983
I already
told Richard about it.

17:51.983 --> 17:54.812
- I did, I told you...
- Yes, and I'm kind of upset,

17:54.812 --> 17:56.292
to tell you the truth.

17:56.292 --> 17:58.077
She's dreaming
about another man.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.166
Yeah, very
similar to yours, Naomi.

18:00.166 --> 18:03.386
Except in my case,
it's this... this guy
that we sort of know.

18:03.386 --> 18:05.214
This old friend
of Richard's, Paul.

18:05.214 --> 18:08.087
Well, we went to
the same university.

18:08.087 --> 18:11.002
He's actually
not that memorable.

18:11.002 --> 18:12.917
- He's kind of boring.

18:12.917 --> 18:15.224
I... I don't get
why you're so into him.

18:15.224 --> 18:16.704
I'm not into him.

18:16.704 --> 18:18.314
So, what does he look like?

18:18.314 --> 18:21.274
Well, he does actually
kind of look like Sydney.

18:23.276 --> 18:24.755
Do you have a picture?

18:45.994 --> 18:47.169
Paul?

18:49.171 --> 18:50.781
Oh, my God.

18:50.781 --> 18:52.348
- Paul. Paul!
[ON PHONE] <i>Hello.</i>

18:52.348 --> 18:54.133
Oh, my God.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.525
<i>Are you there?</i>
Hey, what...

18:55.525 --> 18:56.961
what happened?

18:57.832 --> 18:58.920
Hey.

19:11.367 --> 19:15.893
Janet! There...
there... there's, like,
100 messages on here.

19:15.893 --> 19:17.765
Probably Claire's article.

19:17.765 --> 19:21.072
She must have linked it
to my profile or something.

19:21.638 --> 19:23.553
Somebody wants
to interview me.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.120
Why are you so excited?

19:25.120 --> 19:28.341
- Why? What's wrong?
- This is strange, Paul.

19:28.341 --> 19:30.821
Maybe you should
take a minute and think

19:30.821 --> 19:32.388
before you do
anything drastic.

19:38.481 --> 19:41.484
Why me?
Uh, I don't know,

19:41.484 --> 19:43.312
I'm special, I guess.

19:43.312 --> 19:46.228
<i>An area man
has found himself
at the center of</i>

19:46.228 --> 19:48.012
<i>a strange dream epidemic,</i>

19:48.012 --> 19:51.015
<i>which scientists are
struggling to make sense of.</i>

19:51.015 --> 19:53.888
[ON TV] <i>So we
actually don't know
what's causing this,</i>

19:53.888 --> 19:58.284
<i>but it's sort of like a dream
version of the Mandela effect,</i>

19:58.284 --> 20:00.547
<i>which is when multiple
people report having the same</i>

20:00.547 --> 20:02.810
<i>false memory without
any logical explanation.</i>

20:02.810 --> 20:04.420
<i>Now, then
there's something called</i>

20:04.420 --> 20:07.554
<i>- astral projections, right?</i>
- No, Mom, I don't know.

20:07.554 --> 20:09.643
<i>This is a spiritual
type of dream visitation.</i>

20:09.643 --> 20:11.688
<i>Scientifically,
this is dubious, of course,</i>

20:11.688 --> 20:13.560
<i>- but it has been reported.</i>
- I didn't do anything.

20:13.560 --> 20:16.824
<i>It... it's a very interesting
time in my field...</i>

20:16.824 --> 20:19.043
This is gonna be so weird
to explain at school.

20:19.043 --> 20:21.655
<i>Our online poll
shows thousands of reports
of the phenomenon.</i>

20:21.655 --> 20:25.049
What are you getting
so upset for, Mom? I'm fine.

20:25.049 --> 20:27.313
I'm missing
the whole segment now.

20:27.313 --> 20:29.837
[ON TV] <i>But I'm always
inclined to think, rationally,</i>

20:29.837 --> 20:31.534
<i>that anything supernatural</i>

20:31.534 --> 20:33.057
<i>has to be socially constructed.</i>

20:33.057 --> 20:36.974
<i>But this one is, uh,
mysterious, even for me.</i>

20:53.295 --> 20:57.343
Okay. Okay.
Please calm down.

20:57.865 --> 20:58.996
Calm down.

20:58.996 --> 21:00.171
Thank you.

21:00.607 --> 21:02.304
Who's really here for
the lecture on kin selection?

21:02.304 --> 21:03.479
Show of hands.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.221
Okay, the rest of you,
I'll give you five minutes

21:06.221 --> 21:07.875
before I start
the lecture, okay?

21:07.875 --> 21:09.224
Ask me anything.

21:09.224 --> 21:10.356
Yes, you?

21:10.356 --> 21:11.661
How does it feel to go viral?

21:11.661 --> 21:12.967
Huh.

21:13.446 --> 21:16.144
Well, we can discuss that
when we get to memetics

21:16.144 --> 21:17.624
later this year.

21:17.624 --> 21:19.756
- Yes, you?
- Why is this happening?

21:19.756 --> 21:21.367
I have no clue.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.325
My guess would
be as good as yours.

21:23.325 --> 21:26.981
Are you gonna do, like,
Stephen Colbert or anything?

21:26.981 --> 21:28.678
-  Oh, not a chance.

21:28.678 --> 21:31.681
I actually enjoy my anonymity,
if you can believe that.

21:31.681 --> 21:33.596
Okay. You!

21:33.596 --> 21:35.772
I think maybe I had
a dream about you

21:35.772 --> 21:38.253
but it's, like,
super blurry and, like,

21:38.253 --> 21:40.168
I wanna, like,
be better at remembering them.

21:40.168 --> 21:43.432
- And, uh, how do I do that?
- I'm not really an expert here.

21:43.432 --> 21:46.957
Keeping a dream journal
is a common exercise,

21:46.957 --> 21:48.959
but isn't seeing
me in class enough?

21:50.570 --> 21:53.312
Who's certain they've
actually had a dream about me?

21:54.400 --> 21:56.271
Okay.
Let's explore this.

21:56.271 --> 21:57.881
This might get us
somewhere interesting.

21:58.491 --> 22:00.928
Does anyone want to share
the content of their dream?

22:00.928 --> 22:03.974
- Yes, you?
- Well, um.

22:03.974 --> 22:05.454
I'm in this forest,

22:05.454 --> 22:08.762
<i>wandering around, eating
these strange mushrooms,</i>

22:09.458 --> 22:12.243
<i>and I'm in, like,
a full tuxedo for some reason.</i>

22:12.983 --> 22:15.682
<i>And there's other
people also dressed up,</i>

22:15.682 --> 22:19.990
<i>but they're all scared,
like, frozen in fear.</i>

22:20.817 --> 22:22.776
<i>And then I realize
it's because of this</i>

22:22.776 --> 22:24.865
<i>really tall man
running towards me.</i>

22:47.540 --> 22:48.758
Hide.

22:50.717 --> 22:52.196
Are you talking to me?

22:52.196 --> 22:54.677
Yes, Paul, he'll kill us.

22:54.677 --> 22:55.765
Paul!

22:55.765 --> 22:57.288
I've never seen these.

22:58.115 --> 22:59.290
Beautiful.

23:00.030 --> 23:02.511
No! No!

23:02.511 --> 23:05.993
- And that's all I remember.

23:05.993 --> 23:08.038
Ah. Interesting.

23:08.038 --> 23:11.694
So, I'm looking
at the mushrooms

23:11.694 --> 23:14.349
- instead of helping?
- Oh, I suppose, yeah.

23:15.045 --> 23:17.396
Okay, let's hear
another one. Anyone?

23:43.726 --> 23:47.164
Okay, so,
I'm just observing again.

23:47.948 --> 23:49.340
But that's funny.

23:49.340 --> 23:51.038
Interesting one.

23:51.038 --> 23:52.213
Anyone else?

23:59.612 --> 24:00.700
Huh.

24:13.103 --> 24:15.366
- It ends like that?
- Yeah.

24:15.366 --> 24:17.673
That's, uh,
that's all I can remember.

24:17.673 --> 24:20.763
Does anyone have
a more original one?

24:20.763 --> 24:23.940
Maybe one where
I'm actually doing something.

24:26.116 --> 24:27.291
No one?

24:28.336 --> 24:30.077
Okay, well,
let's just hear them anyway.

24:30.077 --> 24:32.688
- Who's next?

24:42.481 --> 24:43.830
Dad.

24:44.047 --> 24:46.049
Oh, my God, delete that.

24:46.049 --> 24:47.877
No, it's fine.
I'm just sending it to Kyle.

24:47.877 --> 24:49.879
- Who's Kyle?
- Tammy's friend.

24:49.879 --> 24:51.794
He doesn't believe
you're my dad for some reason.

24:51.794 --> 24:54.318
Oh, you guys are flirting?

24:54.318 --> 24:57.452
No, um, he was
just asking about you.

24:57.452 --> 24:59.280
So, I'm finally cool, huh?

24:59.933 --> 25:01.630
Well, I wouldn't go that far.

25:01.630 --> 25:02.805
You hear that, Janet?

25:02.805 --> 25:04.198
She's saying
I'm a cool dad now.

25:04.198 --> 25:06.243
I didn't...
I didn't say that.

25:06.243 --> 25:07.810
Can you drive
me to school today?

25:07.810 --> 25:10.204
- You want me to?
Mm-hmm.

25:10.552 --> 25:11.814
I guess I can make it.

25:11.814 --> 25:14.295
- Janet, does that work?
- Yeah, take her.

25:15.601 --> 25:18.342
Dude, this is so insane.

25:18.342 --> 25:20.910
Like, how's he
dealing with all this?

25:20.910 --> 25:24.131
We're not even the type
of people that like attention,

25:24.131 --> 25:25.349
- you know?
- Right.

25:25.349 --> 25:27.613
So, the whole
thing is so bizarre.

25:27.613 --> 25:29.745
So bizarre.
So bizarre.

25:29.745 --> 25:32.443
My sister is actually, like,

25:32.443 --> 25:34.968
starstruck that I know you,
you know?

25:34.968 --> 25:36.447
She sent me this
article and she's like,

25:36.447 --> 25:37.753
"Check this guy out, Paul."

25:37.753 --> 25:40.713
And I was like,
"Uh, that's Paul Matthews.

25:40.713 --> 25:42.062
"I know his wife."

25:42.062 --> 25:44.368
- That's so funny.
- Yeah. Also, I was listening

25:44.368 --> 25:46.153
to this podcast that I like.

25:46.153 --> 25:47.720
They were talking about Paul.

25:47.720 --> 25:49.373
Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

25:49.373 --> 25:52.855
They were relating Paul to,
like, this old internet meme.

25:52.855 --> 25:54.683
And then they were
talking about how, like,

25:54.683 --> 25:56.859
all memes will become dreams

25:56.859 --> 25:58.905
- or something like that.
- Oh, that's interesting.

25:58.905 --> 26:00.080
It is interesting.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.125
How is the museum going,
by the way?

26:02.125 --> 26:03.518
- The what?
- The museum.

26:03.518 --> 26:04.693
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:04.693 --> 26:06.173
No, it's good. It's good.

26:06.173 --> 26:07.783
I feel like there's
a few challenges for us

26:07.783 --> 26:09.611
to still wrap up,
but overall it's going good.

26:09.611 --> 26:10.873
Thanks for asking.

26:10.873 --> 26:12.222
- Great.
- Mm-hmm.

26:12.222 --> 26:14.181
- I know it's not my project...
Mm-hmm.

26:14.181 --> 26:17.184
...but I'd love to
be involved somehow.

26:17.184 --> 26:18.751
Oh, yeah.

26:18.751 --> 26:20.187
No, thanks. I mean, I...

26:20.187 --> 26:22.058
I feel like we're
in a pretty good position.

26:22.058 --> 26:23.582
Yeah. You know,

26:23.582 --> 26:26.497
just if you want to bounce
ideas or want some feedback.

26:27.977 --> 26:31.764
Yeah. No. Yeah, I think,
uh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:32.199 --> 26:35.811
You just want to bounce ideas
back and maybe just... yeah.

26:35.811 --> 26:37.770
I thought
you weren't on that project.

26:37.770 --> 26:39.815
Well, I wasn't,
but now Chris wants me on.

26:39.815 --> 26:41.251
Well, that's great.

26:41.251 --> 26:43.166
- I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.

26:43.166 --> 26:45.212
We also got an invite
to one of Richard's famous

26:45.212 --> 26:46.387
dinner parties.

26:46.387 --> 26:49.608
- Really? When?
- On the 5th.

26:49.608 --> 26:52.262
Can you believe it,
after all these years?

26:53.046 --> 26:56.571
I was tempted to say no,
but I think we should go.

26:57.006 --> 26:58.442
- Hey, Paul.
- Yeah?

26:59.618 --> 27:01.881
Why do you suppose you're
not showing up in my dreams?

27:01.881 --> 27:04.231
Well, because
you get the real deal.

27:04.231 --> 27:05.841
It wouldn't
be fair if you got both.

27:07.364 --> 27:10.367
- Are you jealous?
- I don't know. I mean,

27:10.367 --> 27:12.674
- rationally, I'm not, but...
- Then maybe I should

27:12.674 --> 27:14.023
give you a little visit.

27:14.850 --> 27:16.156
What would you want me to do?

27:16.765 --> 27:19.594
What would you want
to see in your dream?

27:19.594 --> 27:24.904
Wow. Um...
I want to see you...

27:27.123 --> 27:28.995
Remember when you wore
that Talking Heads suit

27:28.995 --> 27:30.213
for Halloween?

27:30.605 --> 27:31.780
Yeah.

27:31.780 --> 27:33.477
There was just
something about it.

27:33.477 --> 27:35.349
Something kind
of weird and sexy.

27:36.002 --> 27:38.569
You should
wear that and save me

27:38.569 --> 27:40.571
from, like, some situation.

27:42.965 --> 27:44.706
That's your sexual fantasy?

27:44.706 --> 27:46.316
Sky's the limit here

27:46.316 --> 27:49.319
and you sell it for me wearing
a comically large suit.

27:49.319 --> 27:52.105
I don't know,
I'm not good under pressure.

27:52.105 --> 27:56.196
Just show up naked,
on a horse, with a huge penis.

27:56.196 --> 27:58.024
- Is that better?
- Who has a huge penis?

27:58.024 --> 27:59.808
- Me or the horse?
- You.

27:59.808 --> 28:01.418
I'm doing the David Byrne suit.

28:01.418 --> 28:03.159
- It's been decided.
No, let me think
about it.

28:03.159 --> 28:04.378
No, no, no.

28:04.378 --> 28:05.771
You immediately
said the suit and that's

28:05.771 --> 28:06.859
- what you're getting.
- Fine.

28:09.818 --> 28:11.341
Do you think
other people are seeing

28:11.341 --> 28:14.083
you naked in their dreams?

28:14.780 --> 28:16.303
Does that turn you on?

28:17.521 --> 28:19.132
Does it turn me on?

28:19.567 --> 28:21.874
Maybe somebody's
dreaming about me right now.

28:23.136 --> 28:25.138
- Yeah.
- Maybe a bunch of people,

28:25.878 --> 28:27.401
at the same time.

28:28.619 --> 28:29.708
How many?

28:29.708 --> 28:32.623
Hundreds?
Maybe thousands?

28:32.623 --> 28:36.018
Oh, that is
so irresponsible of you.

28:36.018 --> 28:37.628
I can't accept that.

28:37.628 --> 28:39.413
What are you
gonna do about it?

28:39.718 --> 28:43.852
I'm gonna make sure
you stay right here.

29:50.092 --> 29:52.312
I have to kill you, Paul.

29:53.704 --> 29:55.010
I have to!

29:55.010 --> 29:56.490
What are you...
what are you doing?

29:56.838 --> 29:58.274
- Who are you?

29:58.274 --> 29:59.667
Call the police.

29:59.667 --> 30:00.886
What are you
doing in our house?

30:00.886 --> 30:02.844
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Get out!

30:02.844 --> 30:04.324
Oh, my God.

30:04.324 --> 30:06.108
Hannah,
Sophie, stay back!

30:06.108 --> 30:07.327
Mom! Mom!

30:07.327 --> 30:08.850
Do something!
Hannah...

30:08.850 --> 30:11.505
Hannah, take Sophie
to your room and lock the door.

30:11.505 --> 30:12.854
I'm sorry.

30:13.333 --> 30:16.031
- Put down the knife.
- I can't, I have to kill you.

30:16.031 --> 30:17.424
Do something, Paul!

30:17.424 --> 30:19.469
I have to. I have to.

30:19.469 --> 30:20.906
He's in our bedroom...

30:21.297 --> 30:22.864
I have to kill you.

30:25.911 --> 30:28.914
He's had manic
episodes in the past.

30:28.914 --> 30:31.481
It seems that he stopped
taking his medications.

30:32.482 --> 30:34.136
So... so,
what's gonna happen to him?

30:34.136 --> 30:37.139
A psych evaluation,
date with the court,

30:37.139 --> 30:38.662
and then
a judge will decide.

30:38.662 --> 30:40.229
So, he might be back out?

30:41.665 --> 30:44.755
After possibly
serving a sentence, yes.

30:47.715 --> 30:49.804
You know,
fame can come with some

30:49.804 --> 30:51.762
less-than-desirable
side effects.

30:52.198 --> 30:54.591
Strangers might
want to talk to you,

30:54.591 --> 30:56.550
some of them might
be mentally unstable.

30:57.203 --> 30:58.813
You should
be prepared for that.

30:58.813 --> 31:00.032
I'm not getting a gun.

31:00.032 --> 31:02.599
Well, I'm not
necessarily talking weapons.

31:02.599 --> 31:04.253
You have no alarm
in the house.

31:04.253 --> 31:05.820
<i>You had
an unlocked entry point.</i>

31:06.603 --> 31:07.866
<i>That makes you vulnerable.</i>

31:08.954 --> 31:11.347
<i>You could consider a dog.</i>

31:12.044 --> 31:14.829
<i>Sophie,
our daughter, is allergic.</i>

31:15.438 --> 31:17.614
<i>Well, then
you may want to consider</i>

31:17.614 --> 31:19.225
<i>moving to a new house.</i>

31:19.225 --> 31:20.922
<i>Keep your phone number
and address unlisted.</i>

31:20.922 --> 31:23.490
<i>No, we're not moving,
I grew up in this house.</i>

31:23.490 --> 31:26.972
<i>Security cameras, tasers,</i>

31:26.972 --> 31:28.625
<i>strengthening your deadbolts,</i>

31:28.625 --> 31:32.107
<i>securing your windows,
self-defense classes.</i>

31:32.586 --> 31:35.589
It seems like you were pretty
helpless in this situation.

31:37.721 --> 31:39.723
Maybe we should
cool this thing off.

31:39.723 --> 31:42.509
You know, this is why
I was skeptical
in the first place.

31:42.509 --> 31:44.990
Oh, you knew specifically
that this would happen?

31:44.990 --> 31:47.993
This kind of thing, Paul.
Strange consequences.

31:51.474 --> 31:53.041
I think she's right.

31:53.041 --> 31:54.608
Take it as a warning.

31:55.565 --> 31:57.916
I really feel like
you're playing with fire here.

31:57.916 --> 31:59.743
What do you mean,
what am I doing?

31:59.743 --> 32:02.746
Going on TV,
playing along with the story.

32:02.746 --> 32:06.054
This thing is clearly working
like catnip for lunatics.

32:06.054 --> 32:08.317
What do you mean,
playing along?

32:08.317 --> 32:10.537
Do you actually
believe people are

32:10.537 --> 32:11.930
randomly dreaming about you?

32:11.930 --> 32:13.627
You don't think it's
because you're popping up

32:13.627 --> 32:15.759
all over the news
and on the internet?

32:15.759 --> 32:17.500
Yeah, maybe
that accounts for some of it,

32:17.500 --> 32:19.589
but it doesn't
really explain everything.

32:19.589 --> 32:22.331
Okay, so, you think
something magical is happening?

32:22.331 --> 32:23.767
Well, why is it just me?

32:23.767 --> 32:25.944
Why not you,
or anyone else for that matter?

32:25.944 --> 32:28.337
So, you believe in metaphysics

32:28.337 --> 32:29.904
if it proves you're special?

32:30.426 --> 32:31.645
No.

32:33.777 --> 32:35.997
I don't know,
I'm still processing it.

32:35.997 --> 32:37.999
But that guy was just
some delusional man

32:37.999 --> 32:39.392
with his own wild ideas.

32:39.392 --> 32:42.090
I don't think that's going
to be a recurring event.

32:42.090 --> 32:43.787
But why risk it?

32:43.787 --> 32:46.616
Well, if people know
who I am, it's just easier

32:46.616 --> 32:48.357
for me to get
my foot in the door.

32:48.357 --> 32:50.707
Which door are
we talking about here, Paul?

32:52.535 --> 32:55.843
A publisher,
for the book I want to write.

32:55.843 --> 32:57.627
Oh, okay.

32:58.715 --> 33:01.805
Am I sensing a little
midlife crisis here?

33:01.805 --> 33:03.851
Oh, come on.

33:04.373 --> 33:07.115
You're the one who just
bought a fucking Kawasaki!

33:07.115 --> 33:08.769
Okay. Calm down.

33:26.787 --> 33:28.789
- Paul?
Hi, yes.

33:28.789 --> 33:30.573
Hi, I'm Molly.
They're ready for you upstairs.

33:30.573 --> 33:31.661
Great.

33:34.403 --> 33:36.275
- What?
- It... it... it's nothing.

33:36.797 --> 33:38.407
No, come on.

33:38.407 --> 33:40.714
It's just really weird
to see you in real life.

33:40.714 --> 33:42.498
Oh, you've been...

33:42.498 --> 33:44.239
Nonstop every night.

33:44.239 --> 33:46.415
It's crazy, man.

33:46.981 --> 33:50.550
Wow. Well,
I hope I'm behaving.

33:50.550 --> 33:54.162
Well, no, you're not.
No, not at all.

33:54.684 --> 33:55.859
Got Paul here.

33:56.425 --> 33:58.340
There you are.
- Here I am.

33:58.340 --> 34:00.168
Paul. Trent, hey.

34:00.603 --> 34:02.170
I have been dreaming
about this meeting.

34:02.170 --> 34:04.390
- Aw, yeah, me, too.
- Really?

34:04.390 --> 34:06.609
Oh, you mean
literally dreaming?

34:06.609 --> 34:08.785
You know, I've
actually had dreams
about this very meeting.

34:08.785 --> 34:10.700
I mean, I just think
they were just normal dreams.

34:10.700 --> 34:13.790
Not part of the whole,
who's this weird guy
in my dreams?

34:13.790 --> 34:16.358
Oh, uh... I'm weird?

34:16.358 --> 34:18.795
No, I mean, you're not weird.
No, the whole thing
is weird, right?

34:18.795 --> 34:20.145
I mean, Molly's dreams
have been nuts...

34:20.145 --> 34:21.624
- Trent!
If you wanna
talk about weird.

34:21.624 --> 34:23.539
But this is my colleague,
Mary Wiggins.

34:23.539 --> 34:25.802
Hi.
- Hi, Paul.

34:25.802 --> 34:26.890
Sit down.

34:26.890 --> 34:28.240
Here?
- Wherever you want.

34:28.240 --> 34:29.371
Yeah.

34:30.459 --> 34:32.244
How are you? How's life?

34:32.244 --> 34:36.422
Well, uh, things
have been pretty different

34:36.422 --> 34:38.424
since, you know...
since the dreams started.

34:38.424 --> 34:39.990
How fun is that?

34:39.990 --> 34:42.123
I mean, I wish I was the one
people were dreaming about.

34:42.123 --> 34:43.429
- Me, too.
Yeah.

34:43.429 --> 34:45.648
No, it's... it's something.

34:45.648 --> 34:48.651
Well, we're... we're just
so excited to have you here.

34:48.651 --> 34:50.305
Oh, yeah,
we're really fired up.

34:50.305 --> 34:52.046
Um, it's probably
really overwhelming,

34:52.046 --> 34:53.482
right, to walk
into a room like this.

34:53.482 --> 34:54.875
It's like,
"Who are these people?

34:54.875 --> 34:56.398
What am I doing here?"

34:56.398 --> 34:58.661
Maybe we should back up
and just talk about what we do.

34:58.661 --> 35:01.099
Yeah, yeah, so, we started
Thoughts earlier this year,

35:01.099 --> 35:02.796
- so we're a pretty new agency.
- Ah.

35:02.796 --> 35:04.972
And we focus
mostly online,

35:04.972 --> 35:08.149
sort of trying
to holistically pair brands

35:08.149 --> 35:11.283
and more, shall we say,
unconventional celebrities,

35:11.283 --> 35:12.762
if that makes sense?

35:12.762 --> 35:16.157
And I think of you,
right now, in this moment,

35:16.157 --> 35:19.987
Paul, as the most interesting
person in the world.

35:19.987 --> 35:21.249
What?

35:21.249 --> 35:22.555
I mean it, I mean it.

35:22.555 --> 35:23.860
No, we don't
just throw that around.

35:23.860 --> 35:26.211
No, we really
don't throw that around.

35:26.211 --> 35:28.169
I mean, the advantage
that you have, Paul,

35:28.169 --> 35:31.085
is that your impact is...
is not just tied

35:31.085 --> 35:32.869
to any one social arena.

35:32.869 --> 35:34.828
I mean, you're not just famous
for people on TikTok

35:34.828 --> 35:37.178
or for people who read,
say, the New Yorker,

35:37.178 --> 35:40.703
you're in people's minds
when they sleep.

35:40.703 --> 35:43.489
Which means
that anyone who's dreaming,

35:43.489 --> 35:45.404
you know,
could be your audience.

35:45.404 --> 35:46.753
How amazing is that?

35:46.753 --> 35:47.754
Who can say that?

35:49.364 --> 35:50.931
You know,
is that a big enough audience?

35:50.931 --> 35:52.193
- Yeah.

35:52.193 --> 35:53.412
So, you know,
we've been brainstorming

35:53.412 --> 35:54.717
a bunch of cool ideas

35:54.717 --> 35:56.241
that we want
to talk about with you.

35:56.241 --> 35:57.894
But before
we get into any of that,

35:57.894 --> 36:00.070
we were just kind of curious
what you're thinking, you know,

36:00.070 --> 36:02.072
where do you wanna go,
what do you want to achieve?

36:02.072 --> 36:03.944
- What are your dreams?
What are <i>your</i> dreams?

36:03.944 --> 36:06.816
Well, I've been meaning
to write a book

36:06.816 --> 36:08.470
for a few years now.

36:08.470 --> 36:10.211
Just never found
the time, so...

36:10.211 --> 36:11.821
Okay, so, you're a writer?

36:11.821 --> 36:12.953
That's awesome.

36:13.562 --> 36:15.956
You know, we...
we talked about selling

36:15.956 --> 36:17.740
your life rights to
a movie studio, actually.

36:17.740 --> 36:19.655
Oh, because with
all the buzz around this,

36:19.655 --> 36:21.962
I think we could probably
get a six-figure deal.

36:21.962 --> 36:23.355
And that's just life rights.

36:23.355 --> 36:24.747
Really?
Yeah.

36:24.747 --> 36:26.140
- Life rights?
Yeah.

36:26.140 --> 36:27.533
The rights to your life.

36:27.533 --> 36:29.926
Anyway,
here's somewhere cool

36:29.926 --> 36:32.364
that we thought might be
a good place to start.

36:33.234 --> 36:34.627
Sprite.

36:34.627 --> 36:36.237
Sprite.

36:36.237 --> 36:37.673
- Sprite?
Yeah.

36:37.673 --> 36:40.023
Yeah. They... they want us
to run their social.

36:40.023 --> 36:42.069
I think somebody over there
must have lost their minds

36:42.069 --> 36:43.549
or something,
but they're down

36:43.549 --> 36:44.767
to go pretty weird with it.

36:44.767 --> 36:46.552
So, we thought
it could be fun

36:46.552 --> 36:48.945
if maybe they, like,
Tweet a new photo of you

36:48.945 --> 36:50.469
every night holding a can,
you know,

36:50.469 --> 36:51.905
with a fun little caption,

36:51.905 --> 36:53.994
just to really manifest
that connection

36:53.994 --> 36:56.083
in people's minds
and to hopefully alter

36:56.083 --> 36:57.954
the phenomenon,
at least temporarily,

36:57.954 --> 37:01.567
to make people
dream about you
and the product together.

37:01.567 --> 37:03.699
How amazing
would that be, right?

37:03.699 --> 37:05.266
And if we couldn't
figure that out,

37:05.266 --> 37:08.226
we could always just
suggest that it did work

37:08.226 --> 37:09.618
and we could build stories
around that.

37:09.618 --> 37:10.837
Yeah.
Absolutely.

37:10.837 --> 37:12.273
I mean, if we fail
altogether, then we...

37:12.273 --> 37:13.666
that's kind of
a fun story, too.

37:13.666 --> 37:15.407
You know, like,
we tried to make people dream

37:15.407 --> 37:17.278
about Sprite
and it didn't work.

37:17.278 --> 37:18.801
- I mean, it's so dumb...
I love that.

37:18.801 --> 37:20.803
...that it's kind of cool,
you know, it kind of works.

37:20.803 --> 37:22.283
- Can I just...
- Yeah.

37:22.283 --> 37:24.111
Can we go back to the book?

37:24.851 --> 37:25.939
- What book?
My book.

37:25.939 --> 37:27.332
The book I wanna write?

37:27.332 --> 37:28.811
I just want to make it clear

37:28.811 --> 37:31.510
that I actually don't want
this whole phenomenon

37:31.510 --> 37:32.728
to be what I'm known for.

37:32.728 --> 37:34.687
I don't want that
to be the main thing

37:34.687 --> 37:36.515
on my Wikipedia, you know?

37:36.515 --> 37:41.215
Okay.
So, what are you thinking?

37:41.215 --> 37:43.435
Well, I'm an
evolutionary biologist.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.132
That's what
I've dedicated my life to.

37:45.132 --> 37:47.700
So, whatever we do,
I want it to be related

37:47.700 --> 37:48.875
to my doctorate.

37:48.875 --> 37:50.442
Wow. Wow.
Okay. See, I...

37:50.442 --> 37:51.704
I didn't know
about that at all.

37:51.704 --> 37:53.009
Well, you're famous
for the dreams, right?

37:53.009 --> 37:54.533
I mean, that's... that's
why anyone's interested.

37:54.533 --> 37:56.230
So, it might be
a bit of a stretch

37:56.230 --> 37:57.971
to get you into
a totally different space.

37:57.971 --> 37:59.102
Yeah.

37:59.799 --> 38:03.672
I'm a tenured professor.
I'm already <i>in</i> the space.

38:03.672 --> 38:05.935
Well, you know, just
to give us a point of contact

38:05.935 --> 38:07.241
as to what
we're talking about,

38:07.241 --> 38:09.199
who are some of the big names
that you like

38:09.199 --> 38:10.331
- in that space?
- Yeah.

38:10.331 --> 38:12.551
Well, there's a bunch,
Robert Sapolsky.

38:12.551 --> 38:14.379
His career
has been pretty admirable.

38:14.379 --> 38:15.510
Oh, is he, um...

38:17.382 --> 38:19.558
No, I don't think
I'm familiar with
him, actually.

38:19.558 --> 38:21.211
Herman Tig, maybe?

38:21.211 --> 38:22.735
- Who?
- Herman Tig.

38:23.649 --> 38:25.433
Yeah.
No, I know that name.

38:25.433 --> 38:26.956
Oh, you do?
- Yeah.

38:26.956 --> 38:29.132
Well, these are not
really celebrities, I suppose.

38:29.132 --> 38:31.221
No, that's the point,
I don't care about fame.

38:31.221 --> 38:32.788
I just see this
as an opportunity

38:32.788 --> 38:34.660
to get some recognition
for my work.

38:34.660 --> 38:36.879
You know, one door
opening another door?

38:36.879 --> 38:38.011
Yeah.
No, I get that.

38:38.011 --> 38:39.186
You're talking
about an audience pivot,

38:39.186 --> 38:40.492
which I think is very smart.

38:40.492 --> 38:42.189
I just don't know
if you can pivot that hard

38:42.189 --> 38:44.147
right now without
a significant drop-off.

38:44.147 --> 38:45.845
I mean,
a book about what, plants?

38:45.845 --> 38:48.326
Yeah, well, I'm not
really interested
in doing Sprite ads.

38:48.326 --> 38:50.197
No, no, no. Well, that's
just one example, though, Paul.

38:50.197 --> 38:51.764
I mean, we have
a ton of ideas.

38:51.764 --> 38:54.288
Oh, that is just
the very tip of the iceberg.

38:54.288 --> 38:55.289
We have so many ideas.

38:55.289 --> 38:57.726
Um, one idea we had was

38:57.726 --> 39:00.860
to make Obama
dream about you.

39:00.860 --> 39:03.558
That would get you into some
of those high-culture spaces

39:03.558 --> 39:04.690
you've been mentioning.

39:05.212 --> 39:08.171
I know Malia,
so we can make it happen.

39:08.171 --> 39:10.260
Maybe this isn't
really what I'm looking for.

39:10.260 --> 39:11.523
I don't think
we're really speaking

39:11.523 --> 39:13.394
- the same language here.
No, Paul.

39:13.394 --> 39:16.092
If that's how you're feeling,
then I'm failing, okay?

39:16.092 --> 39:18.573
Can we just can... can...
can I... can we start over?

39:47.036 --> 39:49.430
I just thought you guys
could help me find a publisher.

39:49.430 --> 39:50.562
- I... I... I...
- First off,

39:50.562 --> 39:51.824
I would like to apologize.

39:53.260 --> 39:55.654
I lied earlier.
I never dreamt about you.

39:55.654 --> 39:57.351
I just thought
that would be a fun way

39:57.351 --> 39:58.439
to start the meeting, okay?

39:58.439 --> 39:59.701
But what is absolutely true

39:59.701 --> 40:00.963
is that I have been thinking

40:00.963 --> 40:02.574
about you a lot

40:02.574 --> 40:04.967
and I just really feel
that we're gonna do

40:04.967 --> 40:06.752
something
very special together.

40:06.752 --> 40:09.232
So let's just say
we go forward
with your plant book.

40:09.232 --> 40:11.887
I never said anything
about plants.

40:11.887 --> 40:14.977
Oh, no. Your... your book
about evolutionary...

40:14.977 --> 40:16.892
- Plants.
- It's about ants.

40:16.892 --> 40:18.285
- Ants.
Ants.

40:18.285 --> 40:19.982
- Oh. Oh.
Okay, great.

40:19.982 --> 40:21.593
Well, let's say
we go forward with that.

40:22.071 --> 40:23.421
We'll help you set that up.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.466
- Really?
Yes. I just...

40:25.466 --> 40:26.902
I really wanna
work with you, Paul.

40:27.642 --> 40:28.817
I mean, like I said,

40:28.817 --> 40:30.776
most interesting person
in the world.

40:32.778 --> 40:35.737
Okay, but then no ads,
no Sprite.

40:35.737 --> 40:37.260
We're focusing on the book.

40:38.087 --> 40:39.915
Yes, and, you know,

40:39.915 --> 40:42.440
if you're not feeling Sprite,
we'll respect that.

40:43.136 --> 40:45.181
I would just ask in return
that you hear out

40:45.181 --> 40:47.488
our pitches and just keep
an open mind, you know,

40:47.488 --> 40:49.490
especially with things
like Sprite because, you know,

40:49.490 --> 40:50.926
the door is kind
of wide open there...

40:50.926 --> 40:52.188
Yeah.
- ...right now.

40:52.188 --> 40:53.363
And they're...
they're ready to have

40:53.363 --> 40:54.495
that conversation with you.

40:54.495 --> 40:55.801
And that door closes,
I'll just say.

41:01.328 --> 41:02.677
Yeah, okay.

41:04.374 --> 41:05.811
So, plans for the night?

41:06.638 --> 41:10.293
Oh, no, I've got a really
early flight back, so...

41:15.647 --> 41:17.649
If you want to get a drink,
just let me know.

41:17.649 --> 41:19.259
I can come near you,
if that's easier.

41:20.086 --> 41:21.566
They have you
at the Ace, right?

41:21.566 --> 41:23.263
They were so great.

41:23.263 --> 41:24.743
They really know their stuff.

41:24.743 --> 41:26.614
They're gonna set me up
with a publisher

41:26.614 --> 41:28.181
and get the book rolling.

41:28.181 --> 41:29.530
<i>Wow, that's great!</i>

41:29.530 --> 41:30.923
<i>Now you just have to write it.</i>

41:31.750 --> 41:33.447
Yeah, of course.

41:33.447 --> 41:34.666
<i>So, what did they say?</i>

41:34.666 --> 41:37.146
They called me
the most interesting person

41:37.146 --> 41:38.844
in the world right now.

41:38.844 --> 41:41.324
<i>Aw.</i>

41:41.324 --> 41:42.891
- What?
- <i>No, nothing.</i>

41:42.891 --> 41:44.371
<i>I'm sure
that's very flattering.</i>

41:44.371 --> 41:45.851
No, they specifically said

41:45.851 --> 41:47.592
they didn't
just throw that around.

41:47.592 --> 41:48.723
<i>Okay.</i>

41:49.158 --> 41:50.856
I don't think they were
just saying it

41:50.856 --> 41:52.248
to make me feel good, Janet,

41:52.248 --> 41:54.163
they're already talking
to big clients

41:54.163 --> 41:55.600
who want to work
with me.

41:55.600 --> 41:56.905
<i>Like who?</i>

41:57.471 --> 42:00.561
Like, I mean... well,
and this is just one example,

42:00.561 --> 42:02.432
but they mentioned Sprite.

42:02.911 --> 42:06.219
<i>Sprite? You're gonna work
with Sprite?</i>

42:06.219 --> 42:07.786
[ON PHONE] <i>Janet.</i>
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

42:07.786 --> 42:08.917
Who's there?

42:08.917 --> 42:10.223
<i>Chris.</i>

42:10.223 --> 42:11.920
<i>Our deadline is tomorrow,</i>

42:11.920 --> 42:13.226
<i>so we're just here
finishing up.</i>

42:13.705 --> 42:14.836
Right.

42:15.315 --> 42:16.577
Where are the kids?

42:16.577 --> 42:18.231
<i>They're out
trick or treating with Kyle.</i>

42:18.231 --> 42:20.450
Oh, Kyle.

42:20.450 --> 42:22.148
Okay.

42:22.148 --> 42:25.107
<i>Yeah, well, congrats, Paul,</i>

42:25.107 --> 42:26.500
<i>I'll see you tomorrow, then.</i>

42:26.500 --> 42:27.936
Yeah, okay.

42:27.936 --> 42:29.677
Well, they... they also talked
about Obama, too,

42:29.677 --> 42:31.549
like maybe
he'll dream about me.

42:32.114 --> 42:33.594
<i>Okay.</i>

42:33.594 --> 42:36.423
I... I'm just saying
it wasn't just Sprite.

42:36.423 --> 42:38.425
<i>You don't
have to impress me, Paul.</i>

42:38.425 --> 42:40.993
<i>- I love you.
<i>I love you, too.</i></i>

42:40.993 --> 42:43.517
<i>Okay.
See you tomorrow.</i>

42:43.517 --> 42:45.214
<i>Yeah. Bye.</i>

42:50.742 --> 42:52.134
Did you read
that article about people

42:52.134 --> 42:54.049
dreaming backward in Australia?

42:54.049 --> 42:55.485
- No.
- It's 'cause of, like,

42:55.485 --> 42:57.139
the gravitational pull
or something.

42:57.139 --> 42:58.837
They mentioned
you in it, so...

42:58.837 --> 43:00.578
How do they dream
in China, then?

43:00.578 --> 43:02.754
Upside down?

43:04.799 --> 43:07.149
So, how long
have you been a professor?

43:07.149 --> 43:12.590
Oh, wow. I think, what,
about 20 years, since '96.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.548
I was born in '96.

43:14.548 --> 43:15.854
Check, please!

43:16.463 --> 43:17.725
No, no, I'm kidding.

43:17.725 --> 43:19.553
Like... like... like,
you're too young for me.

43:20.554 --> 43:23.339
- Aren't you married?
No, I wasn't implying...

43:23.339 --> 43:24.689
It's a joke.

43:24.689 --> 43:26.560
Yeah, no, I mean, I get it.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.606
Oh, okay.

43:28.606 --> 43:30.433
But yeah,
I... I am married.

43:31.130 --> 43:32.610
- How about you?
- No.

43:32.610 --> 43:34.829
I'm not really, like,
seeing anyone or anything.

43:34.829 --> 43:36.352
I'm, like, focusing
on my career right now.

43:36.352 --> 43:37.658
- You know?
Yeah.

43:37.658 --> 43:38.964
You mean with the agency?

43:38.964 --> 43:41.009
You hated it so much,
didn't you?

43:41.009 --> 43:44.709
No, it's just,
it kind of felt like...

43:45.144 --> 43:46.319
Like a cult.

43:46.319 --> 43:48.408
Yeah. Sort of.

43:48.626 --> 43:50.758
I mean, I tried
telling them, like,

43:50.758 --> 43:52.586
"He's a super
smart professor.

43:52.586 --> 43:54.501
"Like, he's gonna
see through the bullshit."

43:54.501 --> 43:58.679
But honestly, though,
like, the Sprite thing is cool.

43:58.679 --> 44:00.202
- You should do it.
Yeah?

44:00.202 --> 44:02.117
- Yeah.
- I'm struggling to imagine

44:02.117 --> 44:05.164
anyone seeing my face and
immediately craving a Sprite.

44:05.164 --> 44:06.426
I would.

44:13.128 --> 44:14.521
Can I ask you something?

44:14.521 --> 44:15.653
Yeah, what?

44:16.001 --> 44:18.133
I felt like
you implied something

44:18.133 --> 44:20.658
earlier about your dreams.

44:21.659 --> 44:22.877
It's embarrassing.

44:22.877 --> 44:25.401
What, do I...
do I act weird or something?

44:25.401 --> 44:27.055
I don't know if I should say.

44:27.055 --> 44:29.710
Well, it's just dreams,
I won't judge.

44:29.710 --> 44:32.365
You don't really get
to decide what happens, so...

44:32.365 --> 44:34.323
Um, well, um...

44:35.629 --> 44:36.717
we fuck.

44:37.587 --> 44:38.980
Really?

44:38.980 --> 44:42.897
I have the most
intense sex dreams.

44:42.897 --> 44:46.596
Usually, I'm, like,
home and it's late

44:46.596 --> 44:49.556
<i>and I'm alone and I'm, like,
watching TV or something.</i>

44:49.556 --> 44:50.775
<i>And then...</i>

44:54.343 --> 44:55.344
Is someone there?

44:59.697 --> 45:00.828
Who are you?

45:05.703 --> 45:06.834
Hello?

45:12.797 --> 45:14.102
Who are you?

45:15.713 --> 45:17.149
How did you get in here?

45:22.632 --> 45:23.982
Please don't hurt me.

45:33.774 --> 45:35.080
I'm so wet.

45:39.737 --> 45:41.173
I'm sorry, I've had,
like, one drink

45:41.173 --> 45:43.349
and I'm, like, no filter.

45:43.349 --> 45:45.351
No, no, it's fine.
It's fine.

45:45.351 --> 45:46.874
No, it's so
graphic, I'm sorry.

45:46.874 --> 45:48.223
I'm glad you told me.

45:48.223 --> 45:49.790
Usually,
what I hear is I'm just

45:49.790 --> 45:51.661
passively hanging around.

45:51.661 --> 45:54.142
It's kind of nice
to hear I'm doing something.

45:54.142 --> 45:55.404
Well, I guess I'm lucky.

45:55.404 --> 45:56.754
Well, I don't know about that.

45:56.754 --> 46:00.322
No, it's so good. Trust me.

46:02.020 --> 46:03.935
Do you want another drink?
I need another drink.

46:03.935 --> 46:05.371
- Martini, right?
- Dirty.

46:13.205 --> 46:14.902
Can I... can I get
another cabernet and...

46:14.902 --> 46:16.599
and one martini, please?

46:28.611 --> 46:30.352
And that's
the thing with the zebras.

46:30.352 --> 46:33.007
The camouflage is for blending
in with the herd

46:33.007 --> 46:35.662
because the lion can't just
hunt the whole group.

46:35.662 --> 46:38.665
It has to identify
a single target, right?

46:38.665 --> 46:40.058
What?

46:40.058 --> 46:42.712
Sorry,
but those people
are staring at us.

46:42.712 --> 46:44.018
I mean, at you, obviously.

46:44.018 --> 46:45.498
Jesus, should we not be here,

46:45.498 --> 46:47.195
- maybe, or should we just...
- Why? What's wrong?

46:47.195 --> 46:49.067
No, I mean...
I just...

46:49.067 --> 46:51.460
I don't want any rumors
if I'm meeting with Obama.

46:51.460 --> 46:53.593
- What do you mean?
No, I mean,

46:53.593 --> 46:55.682
I... I'm not used to this.

46:56.248 --> 46:58.163
- Should we, um...
- What?

46:59.904 --> 47:01.688
I can't get it out
of my head and I'm, like,

47:01.688 --> 47:03.255
here with you and,
like, fuck it, okay.

47:04.169 --> 47:05.518
Can you do me a favor?

47:34.416 --> 47:36.201
Yeah,
so, this is me.

47:41.510 --> 47:45.036
It's nice.
Small and nice.

47:45.863 --> 47:47.821
Yeah, well, I don't
have rich parents, so...

47:47.821 --> 47:49.431
No, it wasn't a jab.

47:49.431 --> 47:50.824
I mean, it's cozy.

47:51.651 --> 47:53.000
You've done a good job.

47:55.916 --> 47:57.178
Sit down.

48:11.932 --> 48:16.719
- So...
- So... This is insane.

48:17.285 --> 48:19.418
You have no fucking idea
how crazy this is to me.

48:20.506 --> 48:23.074
- I shouldn't even be here.
- No, don't leave.

48:23.465 --> 48:25.946
I... I think I'm a bit drunk.

48:25.946 --> 48:27.252
Me, too. Just stay.

48:27.252 --> 48:29.167
You just got here,
just stay for a second.

48:34.955 --> 48:36.261
Is that a fixed gear?

48:37.305 --> 48:41.048
No, it's, uh,
like, a regular one.

48:46.010 --> 48:47.925
So, how do we do this?

48:48.316 --> 48:49.709
Oh, um...

48:51.929 --> 48:54.279
I feel like
I want to change first.

48:54.279 --> 48:56.107
- Is that cool?
- Sure.

48:56.629 --> 48:58.892
Okay. Okay, two seconds.

49:33.840 --> 49:35.276
Everything good?

49:36.712 --> 49:38.105
Yeah.

49:38.671 --> 49:43.937
Um, so, where do you want me?

49:45.025 --> 49:46.548
Could you remove your jacket?

49:48.986 --> 49:50.378
Sure.

49:54.904 --> 49:57.690
Okay, now, would you stand
in that corner over there?

49:58.908 --> 50:00.432
- Over there?
- Yeah.

50:12.487 --> 50:14.533
Get all the way
up against the wall.

50:38.905 --> 50:40.950
- Okay, so, did that work for...
- Sorry, shut up.

50:40.950 --> 50:43.736
Just... can you just...
can you just go on
a little more?

50:44.258 --> 50:47.174
Just, you know,
I'm... I'm married.

50:47.174 --> 50:48.915
I know, we can stop
any time you like.

50:48.915 --> 50:51.178
Just please let me just...
a little longer.

50:55.008 --> 50:57.228
This time, please don't speak.
Just do the dream.

51:13.461 --> 51:15.028
Who are you?

51:20.947 --> 51:22.122
Please don't hurt me.

51:30.565 --> 51:31.740
Touch me.

51:43.361 --> 51:44.666
What?

51:44.666 --> 51:47.452
It's just...
in the dreams you, like...

51:48.105 --> 51:49.541
you usually take the lead.

51:50.150 --> 51:51.369
Yeah.

51:52.239 --> 51:53.545
What do you want?

52:09.126 --> 52:10.692
- Oh.

52:11.911 --> 52:14.392
I'm sorry.
It's just nerves.

52:14.392 --> 52:15.784
It's okay.
Don't worry.

52:16.829 --> 52:19.310
- The body sometimes...
- Yeah. It's fine.

52:19.310 --> 52:21.181
Biologically speaking,
it's actually quite...

52:21.181 --> 52:23.705
- It's... it's fine. Relax.
- It's... it's healthy.

52:23.705 --> 52:26.143
- Okay.
- Okay.

52:56.912 --> 52:58.262
Did you just come?

54:54.987 --> 54:56.118
Fuck!

54:57.294 --> 54:58.382
Fuck!

54:59.513 --> 55:00.645
Fuck.

55:01.733 --> 55:02.864
Fuck.

55:03.474 --> 55:07.042
Yeah, you fuck!

55:11.569 --> 55:13.310
Fuck!

55:21.970 --> 55:23.885
Professor, what's going on?

55:23.885 --> 55:26.061
- Can I come in?
Why?

55:26.540 --> 55:28.847
- I need help with something.
- Okay.

55:31.850 --> 55:33.982
- What?
I don't want
to stand here

55:33.982 --> 55:35.549
in the hallway and explain.

55:35.549 --> 55:37.377
Well, can it wait?
I'm in the middle
of something.

55:37.377 --> 55:38.770
Just five minutes.

55:39.901 --> 55:41.338
I'll come out.

55:41.338 --> 55:43.340
Would be better
if we sat down.

55:58.224 --> 55:59.747
What's... what's going on?

56:00.922 --> 56:04.578
- That was a mistake.
- What do you mean?

56:04.578 --> 56:06.537
What just happened,
that was a mistake.

56:08.495 --> 56:09.844
You shouldn't have done that.

56:09.844 --> 56:12.020
I don't understand.

56:12.020 --> 56:14.109
You're just so
fucking stupid sometimes.

56:14.109 --> 56:17.417
Do you know that?
Have you heard that before?

56:20.899 --> 56:22.379
Okay. Okay.

56:22.379 --> 56:23.641
Please leave.

57:06.074 --> 57:07.249
Where is everyone?

57:07.859 --> 57:09.251
I'm not really sure.

57:11.602 --> 57:14.126
- I'm shocked.
- Yeah, and they got worse.

57:14.779 --> 57:17.477
Some are even
sexual in nature,

57:17.477 --> 57:20.959
so they don't feel
comfortable being in
your class right now.

57:20.959 --> 57:23.527
Jesus, they had
some bad dreams

57:23.527 --> 57:25.877
and now they're not gonna
show up for class?

57:25.877 --> 57:28.270
I mean,
we can't just accept that.

57:28.270 --> 57:30.882
I don't know
what to do here.
I mean, obviously,

57:30.882 --> 57:33.493
I have to take the students'
concerns seriously, too.

57:33.493 --> 57:35.016
Well, yes, of course.

57:35.016 --> 57:38.411
But isn't this a bit
of an overreaction?

57:38.411 --> 57:40.282
They're dreams.
It's not real.

57:40.282 --> 57:42.763
I'm not actually
doing anything to them.

57:42.763 --> 57:45.462
As I said before,
this is new territory.

57:45.462 --> 57:48.465
Um, I think I just need
to consult with HR.

57:52.686 --> 57:55.167
Do you, Brett, as my friend,

57:55.167 --> 57:57.517
and not speaking as
the Dean of Osler,

57:57.517 --> 57:59.214
think that
we should pause this semester

57:59.214 --> 58:01.652
because some students
are having bad dreams?

58:01.652 --> 58:03.784
Well, I haven't had one
of these dreams,

58:03.784 --> 58:05.307
so I can't speak to the...

58:05.307 --> 58:08.223
No, no, no,
don't say lived experience.

58:08.223 --> 58:10.704
But it sounds like they've
actually been traumatized.

58:10.704 --> 58:13.054
Trauma is a trend these days.

58:13.054 --> 58:15.448
It is a joke.
Everything is trauma.

58:15.448 --> 58:17.058
Arguing with a friend
is trauma,

58:17.058 --> 58:18.582
getting bad grades is trauma.

58:18.582 --> 58:20.366
They need to grow up.

58:24.718 --> 58:27.504
- Hi.
- Richard, it's been too long.

58:28.722 --> 58:30.550
- Are we the first ones?

58:30.550 --> 58:33.553
Uh, actually,
it's... it'll just be us.

58:33.553 --> 58:35.729
Really? I thought this was
gonna be one of your famous

58:35.729 --> 58:37.514
bring-people-together things.

58:37.514 --> 58:40.429
Uh, we thought it'd be nicer,
just us four.

58:41.561 --> 58:44.216
Okay, yeah. More wine for us.

58:48.568 --> 58:51.310
- Cheers, guys.
- Cheers.

58:57.272 --> 58:59.579
So, Carlota, I heard you're
at a new practice now.

59:00.319 --> 59:03.148
- Yeah, I am.
- Yeah?

59:04.584 --> 59:06.064
Yes.

59:10.982 --> 59:13.288
This is so good, by the way.

59:13.288 --> 59:15.595
Oh, my gosh, these Brussels
sprouts are amazing.

59:15.595 --> 59:17.858
Yeah, we got them at, uh...

59:20.644 --> 59:22.297
- Shelly's.
- Ah.

59:26.650 --> 59:30.044
So, I'm starting to think that
maybe Nick Bostrum was right

59:30.044 --> 59:31.959
about the simulation theory.

59:31.959 --> 59:34.571
That would sure explain
a lot about my situation.

59:34.571 --> 59:36.877
Yeah, remember
Nick, Carlota?

59:36.877 --> 59:39.271
Swedish guy,
philosopher at Oxford.

59:39.663 --> 59:41.926
- He was here?
- Yeah, once or twice.

59:41.926 --> 59:43.623
You should invite us
both next time.

59:44.058 --> 59:45.799
He'd probably love
to speak with me.

59:46.757 --> 59:49.498
Wasn't I even the one
who told you about him?

59:50.151 --> 59:52.023
No, I don't think so.

59:58.769 --> 01:00:00.640
Carlota, are you still
doing your pottery?

01:00:05.036 --> 01:00:06.646
-  Ah.

01:00:06.646 --> 01:00:08.169
- Oh, don't be so rough.
- What?

01:00:08.169 --> 01:00:09.736
You're slamming my back.

01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:14.436
- Sorry.
- Is... is everything good?

01:00:14.436 --> 01:00:17.744
She had a... a rough day
at work today.

01:00:17.744 --> 01:00:19.093
Ah.
- So...

01:00:19.093 --> 01:00:20.529
Okay.

01:00:26.187 --> 01:00:28.755
Oh, no. What's the matter?

01:00:30.888 --> 01:00:32.803
Sorry, can't do this.
I can't.

01:00:39.592 --> 01:00:41.246
What the hell is going on?

01:00:41.246 --> 01:00:42.639
I have no idea.

01:00:45.076 --> 01:00:47.295
- Richard.
- Richard, what's wrong?

01:00:48.427 --> 01:00:52.300
Uh, guys, uh... I think we're
gonna have to wrap this up.

01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:54.172
Carlota isn't feeling well.

01:00:54.172 --> 01:00:57.218
Oh, no. Is she ill?

01:00:57.654 --> 01:01:01.614
It...  It's you, Paul.

01:01:03.007 --> 01:01:07.141
She's had some pretty brutal
nightmares lately.

01:01:07.141 --> 01:01:11.450
Oh, wow. I just couldn't...

01:01:11.450 --> 01:01:13.800
I'm so sorry,
you could have told us.

01:01:13.800 --> 01:01:15.715
I convinced her not to cancel.

01:01:15.715 --> 01:01:18.631
- I shouldn't have done that.

01:01:18.631 --> 01:01:21.416
Well, shouldn't
the three of us
still finish, though?

01:01:21.416 --> 01:01:24.985
- It'd be a waste to just...
- No, you... you have to leave.

01:01:26.291 --> 01:01:28.685
- Really?
Yeah, really.

01:01:29.207 --> 01:01:31.383
Why do you think
no one else is here?

01:01:35.779 --> 01:01:39.957
The basic idea
with cognitive
behavioral therapy

01:01:39.957 --> 01:01:43.264
is that we'll go through
gradual exposure

01:01:43.264 --> 01:01:45.310
to what we feel
is threatening us

01:01:45.310 --> 01:01:48.052
to familiarize with it,
instead of fearing it.

01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:51.011
What doesn't kill us makes us
stronger, right?

01:01:51.838 --> 01:01:53.710
I know a lot of you have had

01:01:54.449 --> 01:01:56.451
very upsetting dreams
about your professor.

01:01:58.758 --> 01:02:01.543
These dreams suggest
that Paul Matthews

01:02:01.543 --> 01:02:03.023
is a harmful person.

01:02:04.329 --> 01:02:06.853
So, your mind is trying
to protect you,

01:02:06.853 --> 01:02:11.292
make you safe by creating
certain emotional triggers.

01:02:12.206 --> 01:02:14.121
Motivating you to avoid him.

01:02:15.470 --> 01:02:18.082
I want to defuse
those triggers

01:02:18.082 --> 01:02:20.040
by showing you that Paul

01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:24.741
is, in fact, a kind, loving,
harmless human being.

01:02:51.811 --> 01:02:56.990
Okay. I'm going to invite
Paul into the room.

01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:00.559
He's gonna step
inside that door,

01:03:00.559 --> 01:03:02.213
all the way over there

01:03:02.213 --> 01:03:05.651
and he's gonna stay at
that safe distance

01:03:05.869 --> 01:03:08.262
until everybody
feels comfortable

01:03:08.262 --> 01:03:09.611
to invite him closer.

01:03:10.177 --> 01:03:14.399
If anyone feels unsafe,
calmly state,

01:03:14.399 --> 01:03:17.315
"Candice, I do not feel safe
in this moment."

01:03:19.056 --> 01:03:20.884
Does everybody understand that?

01:03:20.884 --> 01:03:22.494
Yes.

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.066
All right. Paul!

01:03:44.168 --> 01:03:46.910
Okay. That wasn't
so bad, was it?

01:03:48.085 --> 01:03:49.913
Let's have him step forward.

01:03:49.913 --> 01:03:51.828
Come just a little bit closer.

01:03:52.785 --> 01:03:54.047
Paul.

01:04:06.799 --> 01:04:08.192
Paul isn't gonna hurt you.

01:04:09.497 --> 01:04:11.456
Can we have him come just
a little bit closer?

01:04:17.114 --> 01:04:19.072
Paul, step closer, please.

01:04:33.826 --> 01:04:35.393
So...

01:04:35.393 --> 01:04:36.742
Leah, wait.

01:04:36.742 --> 01:04:38.613
Look what you did...

01:05:15.563 --> 01:05:17.217
Hey! Hey!

01:05:18.436 --> 01:05:19.741
Who did this?

01:05:21.178 --> 01:05:22.527
Tell me now.

01:05:23.963 --> 01:05:25.965
Stop being little
fucking brats.

01:05:27.967 --> 01:05:29.926
Who the fuck did this?

01:05:32.015 --> 01:05:34.756
- Fuck you, Matthews.
Go home!

01:05:34.756 --> 01:05:36.410
Why don't
you just quit, Paul?

01:05:36.410 --> 01:05:38.021
- Bye, Paul.
- Bye.

01:05:38.021 --> 01:05:39.544
- Bye.

01:05:39.544 --> 01:05:40.937
So, what did Brett say?

01:05:41.459 --> 01:05:43.374
See it as
a little vacation.

01:05:44.070 --> 01:05:45.854
Can you believe it?

01:05:46.290 --> 01:05:48.683
I'm a tenured professor
and they're basically

01:05:48.683 --> 01:05:50.250
just letting the students
run the school.

01:05:51.251 --> 01:05:52.818
So, how long are you
not gonna be working?

01:05:52.818 --> 01:05:55.125
I don't even know if I want
to go back at this point.

01:05:55.125 --> 01:05:57.344
I should just go all in
with the book.

01:06:00.217 --> 01:06:02.697
So, like, what did you do?
Why did everything change?

01:06:02.697 --> 01:06:05.004
- I didn't do anything, Hannah.
- You must have done something.

01:06:05.004 --> 01:06:08.094
- Well, I didn't, so...
- Have you seen Twitter?

01:06:09.008 --> 01:06:12.011
- No.
- It's like thousands of people

01:06:12.011 --> 01:06:13.621
sharing nightmares
about, like...

01:06:13.621 --> 01:06:16.885
- like, torture and rape and...
- Enough, okay?

01:06:17.538 --> 01:06:18.975
New rule.

01:06:18.975 --> 01:06:21.107
No phones at the table

01:06:21.107 --> 01:06:25.111
and no discussion
of the dreams, okay?

01:06:25.111 --> 01:06:27.157
I'm just saying, like,
I... I understand...

01:06:27.157 --> 01:06:28.985
Okay, you already broke
the rule, Hannah.

01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:30.421
So, let's just start over.

01:06:30.812 --> 01:06:35.817
No mention of this
at the table
ever again, please.

01:06:39.691 --> 01:06:41.649
Are you gonna clean
that stuff off the car?

01:06:44.435 --> 01:06:46.654
They're kicking me off
the project?

01:06:46.654 --> 01:06:50.354
I think that they
just want to be
extra careful moving into

01:06:50.354 --> 01:06:53.531
the final stages, just as
a precautionary measure.

01:06:53.531 --> 01:06:55.533
Because of Paul?

01:06:56.186 --> 01:06:58.536
Yeah. You know,
I'm against cancel culture

01:06:58.536 --> 01:07:00.625
and all of that stuff,
I really am.

01:07:00.625 --> 01:07:04.237
But I think that just right
now maybe it would be best

01:07:04.237 --> 01:07:07.066
if you kept a lower profile,
you know?

01:07:07.501 --> 01:07:11.636
Just until the whole, like,
scandal situation blows over.

01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:16.554
- Does that make sense?

01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:24.431
They call you Freddie Krueger
at school.

01:07:24.823 --> 01:07:27.565
Oh? Do you know who that is?

01:07:27.826 --> 01:07:29.436
I Googled it.

01:07:29.436 --> 01:07:31.917
Yeah, they're just trying
to tease you.

01:07:31.917 --> 01:07:34.006
Julian said that you
tied him up

01:07:34.006 --> 01:07:36.922
and cut his toes off
and ate them.

01:07:36.922 --> 01:07:40.534
Do you think I would cut
someone's toes off?

01:07:43.494 --> 01:07:45.017
No.

01:07:51.806 --> 01:07:54.809
Dreaming is like
a psychosis, Sophie.

01:07:54.809 --> 01:07:58.813
Our brain decides
to start hallucinating
while we sleep.

01:07:59.597 --> 01:08:02.208
It's part of
its housekeeping process.

01:08:02.948 --> 01:08:06.734
We need that to happen,
for some reason.

01:08:08.823 --> 01:08:11.130
But why are you so mean
in the dreams?

01:08:11.130 --> 01:08:14.960
It's their dreams.
I have nothing to do with it.

01:08:15.874 --> 01:08:18.094
You understand that, right?

01:08:18.833 --> 01:08:20.183
I guess.

01:08:21.445 --> 01:08:23.708
I think I'm going to stay
home tomorrow.

01:08:23.708 --> 01:08:26.189
So, if you need me
to cook or something...

01:08:27.668 --> 01:08:30.976
- Who's Molly?
- What?

01:08:30.976 --> 01:08:33.500
You have texts from
someone named Molly?

01:08:35.198 --> 01:08:37.983
Oh, she's the assistant
at the agency.

01:08:37.983 --> 01:08:39.941
She's setting up a call.

01:08:39.941 --> 01:08:41.247
Mm.

01:08:41.900 --> 01:08:43.597
You never mentioned her.

01:08:55.783 --> 01:08:57.220
Hey, it's Paul.

01:08:58.786 --> 01:09:01.354
I... I was just
calling to say hi.

01:09:04.270 --> 01:09:05.880
<i>Okay, we can
do it another time.</i>

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:09.057
<i>I just... just wanted
to catch up. Yep.</i>

01:09:09.057 --> 01:09:10.668
<i>No worries.
Okay, bye.</i>

01:09:10.668 --> 01:09:12.104
<i>Bye-bye.</i>

01:09:20.373 --> 01:09:22.114
<i>Two seconds, Paul.</i>

01:09:22.114 --> 01:09:23.768
<i>I'm just trying
to connect Mary to the call.</i>

01:09:23.768 --> 01:09:25.117
Yeah, no problem.

01:09:25.813 --> 01:09:27.728
<i>Hi, Paul.</i>
- Who's this?

01:09:28.816 --> 01:09:31.167
<i>It's Molly,
I'm just listening in.</i>

01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:35.997
Hi, Molly. How are you?

01:09:36.650 --> 01:09:38.391
<i>Hello?
Is everybody on?</i>

01:09:38.391 --> 01:09:39.697
I'm here, Trent.

01:09:40.045 --> 01:09:43.222
<i>Hey, Mary, you on?</i>
<i>Oh! Oh, Trent,</i>

01:09:43.222 --> 01:09:45.050
<i>sorry, Mary just texted me
and she had the wrong link.</i>

01:09:45.050 --> 01:09:47.705
Should we just start?

01:09:47.705 --> 01:09:50.011
<i>Um, yeah.</i>
<i>Hello?</i>

01:09:50.011 --> 01:09:51.926
<i>Hey, there you are.</i>
<i>Can you guys hear me?</i>

01:09:51.926 --> 01:09:54.451
<i>Yeah. Paul?</i>

01:09:54.451 --> 01:09:57.105
Yeah, I can hear you.
What's going on, guys?

01:09:57.845 --> 01:09:59.934
<i>Okay, hi.
What a crazy week, right?</i>

01:09:59.934 --> 01:10:02.807
<i>So, obviously, we have
to change strategies here</i>

01:10:02.807 --> 01:10:04.548
<i>to adapt
to the current situation.</i>

01:10:04.548 --> 01:10:06.027
Is Obama still a thing?

01:10:06.027 --> 01:10:07.420
That might be
helpful now, right?

01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:08.987
<i>What?</i>

01:10:08.987 --> 01:10:12.208
Obama, you said you guys
were talking to Obama, right?

01:10:12.208 --> 01:10:15.863
<i>Oh, I'm... Obama is not
an option anymore, Paul.</i>

01:10:15.863 --> 01:10:17.778
<i>Yeah. No. So, Paul,
we're... we're talking about</i>

01:10:17.778 --> 01:10:19.954
<i>a complete 180.
We have to think fresh.</i>

01:10:19.954 --> 01:10:23.044
<i>Corporate culture won't
touch this. It's too risky.</i>

01:10:23.044 --> 01:10:25.046
<i>Yeah, but we are
getting positive signals</i>

01:10:25.046 --> 01:10:27.266
<i>from a different venue.
The whole,</i>

01:10:27.266 --> 01:10:28.789
<i>I don't wanna say alt-right,</i>

01:10:28.789 --> 01:10:31.270
<i>but the kind of
anti-establishment space,</i>

01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:33.316
<i>you know, kind of
the Jordan Peterson route.</i>

01:10:33.316 --> 01:10:36.101
<i>Yeah, we can maybe get
you on Rogan or something.</i>

01:10:36.101 --> 01:10:39.191
<i>Share your experience of being
cancelled and just, like,</i>

01:10:39.191 --> 01:10:41.454
<i>pivot that combo
to the plant book.</i>

01:10:41.454 --> 01:10:45.153
Guys, no. I hate that idea.

01:10:45.153 --> 01:10:47.982
<i>Uh-huh. So, just so
we can understand you better,</i>

01:10:47.982 --> 01:10:49.680
<i>what exactly
are you opposed to?</i>

01:10:49.680 --> 01:10:52.465
I don't wanna be some
culture war person.

01:10:52.465 --> 01:10:56.295
I... I... I don't
want to be controversial.

01:10:56.295 --> 01:10:58.210
<i>Okay. Well, yeah,</i>

01:10:58.210 --> 01:11:00.821
<i>this is gonna go
right against what
you're saying right now.</i>

01:11:00.821 --> 01:11:02.736
<i>But there is a chance,
we think, to get you</i>

01:11:02.736 --> 01:11:04.303
<i>- on Tucker Carlson
this week...</i>
<i>Tucker.</i>

01:11:04.303 --> 01:11:06.131
<i>So, that's
a big audience.</i>

01:11:06.131 --> 01:11:07.611
<i>Just think about that.
Don't answer right now.</i>

01:11:07.611 --> 01:11:10.309
<i>And then also,
there's France, Paul.</i>

01:11:10.309 --> 01:11:12.224
<i>For some reason,
they love you over there.</i>

01:11:12.224 --> 01:11:14.226
<i>Even with the nightmares,
they love it.</i>

01:11:14.226 --> 01:11:16.141
<i>Yeah. You're building
a fanbase over there.</i>

01:11:16.141 --> 01:11:18.796
Isn't there some type
of charity I can do, maybe?

01:11:19.536 --> 01:11:21.233
<i>No, that's sweet.
But no.</i>

01:11:21.233 --> 01:11:23.104
<i>It might seem apologetic.</i>

01:11:30.634 --> 01:11:33.289
- Hi.
- It's good, thanks.

01:11:36.379 --> 01:11:38.424
- What?
- I'm so sorry, sir.

01:11:38.424 --> 01:11:41.253
I hate to do this, but there are
some people that

01:11:41.253 --> 01:11:43.516
aren't really that comfortable
with the fact that you're here.

01:11:47.738 --> 01:11:49.870
- Okay.
- Yeah.

01:11:49.870 --> 01:11:51.263
Well, if they're
so uncomfortable,

01:11:51.263 --> 01:11:52.612
maybe they should leave.

01:11:52.612 --> 01:11:54.353
Um, yeah, but...

01:11:54.353 --> 01:11:55.746
I'm just enjoying my meal.

01:11:55.746 --> 01:11:57.269
I haven't said
or done anything.

01:11:57.269 --> 01:11:59.576
Right. I mean,
I guess I could tell them

01:11:59.576 --> 01:12:02.056
- you're about to leave, or...
- Why should I leave?

01:12:02.056 --> 01:12:04.320
I haven't broken any
of your rules, have I?

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.147
- I mean, no.
Well, great.

01:12:06.147 --> 01:12:09.934
- Then that's that.
Uh, yeah, I guess.

01:12:09.934 --> 01:12:11.327
Okay.

01:12:22.120 --> 01:12:24.296
Hey, hi.

01:12:25.253 --> 01:12:27.778
Would you do us a favor
and just wrap that up?

01:12:28.605 --> 01:12:30.084
Nobody wants
you here, man.

01:12:30.084 --> 01:12:31.521
Well, I'm staying.

01:12:32.957 --> 01:12:34.959
Are you sure about that?
- Yeah, I'm going to enjoy

01:12:34.959 --> 01:12:37.701
my food and leave
when I'm done, okay?

01:12:39.006 --> 01:12:40.007
Okay.

01:12:54.195 --> 01:12:56.807
<i>♪ When I know
It will happen soon</i>

01:13:04.336 --> 01:13:08.166
<i>♪ And I'll try to go to sleep
But it won't work</i>

01:13:08.166 --> 01:13:11.604

01:13:11.604 --> 01:13:13.345
<i>♪ Where they go</i>

<i>♪ What they know</i>

01:13:21.005 --> 01:13:24.051
<i>♪ And I run away</i>

01:13:26.619 --> 01:13:29.579
Listen,
maybe you need to be
more proactive about this.

01:13:30.362 --> 01:13:31.711
What do you mean?

01:13:32.712 --> 01:13:35.280
Make a public statement
or something?

01:13:36.586 --> 01:13:39.371
- Maybe you should apologize.
I should apologize?

01:13:39.371 --> 01:13:42.026
Take a look at my face
for Christ's sake.

01:13:42.026 --> 01:13:45.377
Well, just to get people
off your back... off our backs.

01:13:45.377 --> 01:13:47.640
No, that's ridiculous.
I'm not gonna do that.

01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:50.426
You're not alone in this.
I almost lost my job.

01:13:50.426 --> 01:13:53.733
Which is completely
uncalled for.

01:13:53.733 --> 01:13:55.866
Sophie is being picked on
at school.

01:13:55.866 --> 01:13:57.258
Hannah is depressed.

01:13:58.216 --> 01:14:01.175
We get weird phone calls
in the middle of the night.

01:14:01.175 --> 01:14:03.308
Someone... someone
broke into our house.

01:14:03.308 --> 01:14:05.876
So, we're just gonna let
the terrorists win?

01:14:05.876 --> 01:14:08.792
Who's to say anything will
be different if I do apologize?

01:14:08.792 --> 01:14:10.489
Oh, so, basically,
you're just choosing for us

01:14:10.489 --> 01:14:11.577
to be more miserable.

01:14:11.577 --> 01:14:13.536
Would you...
would you fucking stop?

01:14:28.507 --> 01:14:29.943
Hey!

01:17:00.659 --> 01:17:04.228
It seems like there's consensus
amongst the parents,

01:17:04.228 --> 01:17:06.665
and if it's not
too much to ask,

01:17:06.665 --> 01:17:08.885
we'd like you
to sit this one out.

01:17:08.885 --> 01:17:11.452
But it is,
it is too much to ask.

01:17:11.452 --> 01:17:14.325
It's ridiculous.
This is a huge moment for her.

01:17:14.325 --> 01:17:15.761
Of course,
I'm going to be there.

01:17:15.761 --> 01:17:17.110
Paul, please.

01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:18.677
What? They're imposing
an exile. Am I supposed

01:17:18.677 --> 01:17:20.331
- to just accept that?
- Don't be so dramatic.

01:17:20.331 --> 01:17:21.898
We'll get someone
to record it, okay?

01:17:21.898 --> 01:17:23.334
You'll...
Um, you'll get to see it.

01:17:23.334 --> 01:17:25.684
Just not in the room
on the night.

01:17:27.425 --> 01:17:29.427
You're aware that
I have a Ph.D., right?

01:17:30.646 --> 01:17:33.213
- Yes.
- And you, B.A.?

01:17:33.213 --> 01:17:35.172
- M.A.
- What I'm saying is,

01:17:35.172 --> 01:17:37.740
I don't need
your opinions on pedagogy.

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:39.916
Okay, I understand
that you want to be there.

01:17:39.916 --> 01:17:42.527
But at... at this point, the
majority of the parents don't.

01:17:42.527 --> 01:17:45.661
They're worried
their kids will feel
unsafe, and obviously,

01:17:45.661 --> 01:17:48.533
that's not, you know,
completely unwarranted.

01:17:48.533 --> 01:17:50.491
Why don't we make it easier
on everyone and you just...

01:17:50.491 --> 01:17:51.797
Why don't
you take my side, Janet?

01:17:51.797 --> 01:17:53.320
Sophie shouldn't have
to be punished

01:17:53.320 --> 01:17:55.714
just because you want
to make a point.

01:17:55.714 --> 01:17:57.542
Don't make us all die
on your hill.

01:17:57.542 --> 01:18:00.371
- Hi. Sorry to bother you.

01:18:01.198 --> 01:18:03.156
Do you own that car
that says, "Loser"?

01:18:04.331 --> 01:18:05.506
Yes.

01:18:09.032 --> 01:18:10.642
Where do I begin?

01:18:13.079 --> 01:18:14.994
Let me start with this.

01:18:14.994 --> 01:18:16.474
I'm sorry.

01:18:17.301 --> 01:18:20.608
I'm sorry, I didn't
address this earlier.

01:18:20.608 --> 01:18:23.263
I'm sorry to anyone who's
had one of those terrible,

01:18:23.263 --> 01:18:24.917
terrible nightmares.

01:18:27.441 --> 01:18:31.358
The reason why
I'm so emotionally distressed

01:18:31.358 --> 01:18:34.318
right now is because
I had one myself.

01:18:34.318 --> 01:18:37.974
I've experienced what
so many of you must
have experienced...

01:18:39.976 --> 01:18:44.067
being violently attacked
and abused by a man

01:18:44.067 --> 01:18:45.546
who looks like me.

01:18:45.546 --> 01:18:48.158
I have to stress,
that man is not me.

01:18:50.203 --> 01:18:53.859
And I speak now from
actual lived experience.

01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:57.776
I'm one of you.

01:19:02.912 --> 01:19:09.396
I've been vilified in my life,
haunted in my dreams.

01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:12.486
My mere presence
upsets people

01:19:12.486 --> 01:19:15.315
and not because
I've actually done anything.

01:19:17.753 --> 01:19:21.060
But because people imagine
I've done things.

01:19:22.670 --> 01:19:25.978
Is it really fair that
I should be punished for that?

01:19:28.459 --> 01:19:32.985
Am I not the biggest victim
in this whole phenomenon?

01:19:34.595 --> 01:19:37.381
Just look at how
it's affecting my life!

01:19:37.381 --> 01:19:40.601
<i>But because people imagine
I've done things.</i>

01:19:40.601 --> 01:19:41.951
I'm actually gonna
have to kill myself.

01:19:41.951 --> 01:19:43.387
<i>Is it really fair that</i>

01:19:43.387 --> 01:19:44.780
<i>I should be
punished for that?</i>

01:19:44.780 --> 01:19:46.607
- What is he doing?
<i>Am I not the biggest</i>

01:19:46.607 --> 01:19:48.044
<i>victim in this
whole phenomenon?</i>

01:19:48.044 --> 01:19:49.654
Fuck.

01:19:49.654 --> 01:19:52.657
It was completely
insincere and self-serving.

01:19:52.657 --> 01:19:54.877
What?
Which part?

01:19:54.877 --> 01:19:56.443
All of it.

01:19:57.401 --> 01:19:59.142
It's embarrassing, Paul.

01:19:59.142 --> 01:20:01.492
It's embarrassing to be
married to you right now.

01:20:08.194 --> 01:20:09.979
Thanks for letting me stay.

01:20:09.979 --> 01:20:12.198
Yeah.
Uh, just a heads up.

01:20:12.503 --> 01:20:14.505
My wife's not
too hot on the idea,

01:20:14.505 --> 01:20:18.683
<i>so I think it's gonna be in
the basement, if that's okay.</i>

01:20:18.683 --> 01:20:19.989
What's the smell?

01:20:19.989 --> 01:20:21.860
I think that's
the propane tank.

01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:23.688
I'll crack open a window.

01:20:23.688 --> 01:20:26.691
I... I can't just sleep
on the couch upstairs?

01:20:26.691 --> 01:20:28.127
I'm sorry, man.

01:20:29.868 --> 01:20:33.611
If you need anything,
just text me, I'll come down.

01:20:33.611 --> 01:20:35.482
- Thanks.
- Okay.

01:22:06.008 --> 01:22:08.619
Excuse me. Sir.

01:22:08.619 --> 01:22:10.534
I'm seeing my daughter.
She's on stage.

01:22:10.534 --> 01:22:13.015
You're Mr. Matthews, right?

01:22:13.015 --> 01:22:15.408
- No.
- You're not Paul Matthews?

01:22:15.408 --> 01:22:16.975
No.

01:22:19.543 --> 01:22:20.848
Call security.

01:22:36.821 --> 01:22:39.128
You can't be here, Paul.

01:22:39.128 --> 01:22:41.130
Let me just watch,
I'll leave before it's over.

01:22:41.130 --> 01:22:42.958
- I thought we had an agreement.
Come on.

01:22:42.958 --> 01:22:44.829
I just want to watch
for a few minutes.

01:22:44.829 --> 01:22:47.005
- Respect our boundaries.
This is ridiculous.

01:22:47.005 --> 01:22:49.181
- Let me in.
- Paul!

01:22:55.971 --> 01:23:00.932
-  Ah!

01:23:05.154 --> 01:23:06.633
He attacked me.

01:23:08.679 --> 01:23:11.290
He... Paul Matthews
attacked me!

01:23:11.290 --> 01:23:13.031
It was an accident.

01:23:13.597 --> 01:23:14.946
She wouldn't let me in.

01:23:15.773 --> 01:23:17.340
I just want to see my daughter.

01:23:19.646 --> 01:23:22.171
She wouldn't let me in.

01:23:22.171 --> 01:23:23.694
It was an accident.

01:23:26.175 --> 01:23:27.828
I just want to see my daughter.

01:23:28.655 --> 01:23:31.310
- Hey, stop.
- No, it was an accident.

01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:34.792
It was an accident.
Sophie, it was an accident.

01:23:34.792 --> 01:23:36.359
- Hold it!

01:23:36.359 --> 01:23:38.404
So... Sophie,
it was an accident.

01:23:39.927 --> 01:23:42.713
Get off me!
Get off of me!

01:23:59.425 --> 01:24:01.123
<i>An average man,</i>

01:24:01.123 --> 01:24:03.429
<i>a cultural sensation,</i>

01:24:03.429 --> 01:24:05.518
<i>a dream turned
into a nightmare.</i>

01:24:05.953 --> 01:24:07.651
<i>For a period,
going to sleep</i>

01:24:07.651 --> 01:24:10.088
<i>meant risking abuse
from this man.</i>

01:24:10.088 --> 01:24:11.916
<i>Though we still
don't understand how</i>

01:24:11.916 --> 01:24:15.093
<i>this phenomenon started
or why it suddenly stopped,</i>

01:24:15.093 --> 01:24:17.530
<i>we can rest assured that
after violently attacking</i>

01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:19.402
<i>a middle school teacher
last fall,</i>

01:24:19.402 --> 01:24:21.752
<i>Paul Matthews disappeared
from the public eye</i>

01:24:21.752 --> 01:24:23.971
<i>and our collective dreams,
all together.</i>

01:24:23.971 --> 01:24:27.323
<i>But through the case of Paul
came one silver lining,</i>

01:24:27.323 --> 01:24:29.977
<i>a revolution
in dream science.</i>

01:24:29.977 --> 01:24:33.938
<i>So now forget the nightmares
and experience a positive way</i>

01:24:33.938 --> 01:24:35.853
<i>of dream travel with Norio.</i>

01:24:35.853 --> 01:24:37.681
- Welcome to the Dream House!

01:24:37.681 --> 01:24:39.683
<i>This is
the Dream House</i>

01:24:39.683 --> 01:24:41.250
<i>on top of
the Hollywood Hills,</i>

01:24:41.250 --> 01:24:43.165
<i>where the next big thing
is happening,</i>

01:24:43.165 --> 01:24:45.254
<i>ads in your dreams.</i>

01:24:45.254 --> 01:24:47.995
"Dreamfluencers,"
or, like, "mindvertisers."

01:24:49.693 --> 01:24:51.477
I don't think there's
like an official title yet.

01:24:51.477 --> 01:24:54.132
Well, I think
social media is over.

01:24:54.132 --> 01:24:58.267
Like if you can promote a song
or a product actually

01:24:58.267 --> 01:25:02.140
in someone's head then that's,
like, way more powerful.

01:25:02.140 --> 01:25:04.621
<i>If one man could
enter other people's dreams,</i>

01:25:04.621 --> 01:25:06.188
<i>couldn't any of us?</i>

01:25:06.188 --> 01:25:07.928
<i>One scientist set out
to find a way.</i>

01:25:07.928 --> 01:25:10.322
We had to rethink
the whole field.

01:25:10.322 --> 01:25:14.544
Consciousness is more complex
than we thought.

01:25:14.544 --> 01:25:17.590
Dualism was right.
Jung was right.

01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:20.158
There is a collective subconscious.

01:25:20.158 --> 01:25:24.249
Paul Matthews proved that,
even if accidentally.

01:25:24.249 --> 01:25:28.297
<i>The Norio would definitely
not exist without him.</i>

01:25:28.297 --> 01:25:31.343
<i>Brian Berg
is the inventor of the Norio,</i>

01:25:31.343 --> 01:25:34.999
<i>a device that makes
it possible to dream travel.</i>

01:25:34.999 --> 01:25:38.263
It's like meditation
or hypnagogia.

01:25:38.263 --> 01:25:40.004
<i>Using
neurotechnology,</i>

01:25:40.004 --> 01:25:43.355
<i>the Norio allows you to visit
anyone in their dreams.</i>

01:25:43.355 --> 01:25:45.705
<i>It may look like
he's just resting.</i>

01:25:45.705 --> 01:25:48.143
<i>But right now,
Brian's inside the dream</i>

01:25:48.143 --> 01:25:51.450
<i>of a random 19-year-old boy
in South Korea.</i>

01:25:52.190 --> 01:25:53.365
It's refreshing.

01:25:53.365 --> 01:25:54.932
I feel like
if people are judging it,

01:25:54.932 --> 01:25:56.890
then they don't really
understand it.

01:25:56.890 --> 01:25:58.196
It's not weird.

01:25:58.196 --> 01:26:00.546
It's just like,
we're gonna be in your dream

01:26:00.546 --> 01:26:02.505
for a brief moment.
We're gonna showcase

01:26:02.505 --> 01:26:05.334
some merch or play a hot
new track and say a few things

01:26:05.334 --> 01:26:07.205
and then we're out.
That's it.

01:26:07.205 --> 01:26:08.946
<i>Paul Matthews
left many skeptical</i>

01:26:08.946 --> 01:26:10.382
<i>about dream travel.</i>

01:26:10.382 --> 01:26:12.950
<i>But the Norio has
a no-nightmare guarantee.</i>

01:26:12.950 --> 01:26:14.647
<i>Without enthusiastic consent</i>

01:26:14.647 --> 01:26:16.649
<i>the dream will
simply be terminated.</i>

01:26:16.649 --> 01:26:19.348
I mean, people always
use Paul Matthews as

01:26:19.348 --> 01:26:20.784
the cautionary tale.

01:26:20.784 --> 01:26:24.179
Okay, this industry
might not exist without him.

01:26:24.179 --> 01:26:26.659
But also, he put such
a negative stamp on it.

01:26:26.659 --> 01:26:30.272
It's kind of insane that
he harnessed all of this power,

01:26:30.272 --> 01:26:33.013
- just so he could
terrorize people.
Mmm-hmm.

01:26:35.842 --> 01:26:37.061
Okay.

01:26:39.194 --> 01:26:42.153
- Ah. Nice.

01:26:43.720 --> 01:26:45.852
Okay, girls,
wanna look at the bedrooms

01:26:45.852 --> 01:26:47.202
and see which ones you like?

01:26:48.246 --> 01:26:49.682
I don't like it.

01:26:49.682 --> 01:26:51.162
Go look at the bedrooms, please.

01:27:00.563 --> 01:27:02.913
So, my friend actually
used to have those dreams.

01:27:03.435 --> 01:27:05.916
Or so she claimed, at least.

01:27:05.916 --> 01:27:07.657
Oh. Ha, yeah.

01:27:18.929 --> 01:27:22.672
So, what happened?
Like, they just stopped or...

01:27:22.672 --> 01:27:24.804
I just feel like I haven't
heard of them in a while.

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:26.632
Yeah. I don't know.

01:27:26.632 --> 01:27:29.200
People stopped
having them, I guess.

01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:31.550
If I hear anything now,
it's mostly abroad.

01:27:33.073 --> 01:27:34.640
What's the smell?

01:27:34.640 --> 01:27:38.557
Oh, I was told that the old
owners were big animal lovers.

01:27:38.557 --> 01:27:40.167
I'm sure
it'll air out in time.

01:27:40.994 --> 01:27:43.562
Um, hey, before you leave,

01:27:43.562 --> 01:27:47.087
have you seen that guy Chris
around the house lately?

01:27:47.871 --> 01:27:50.003
Um, yeah. Yeah.

01:27:50.003 --> 01:27:51.309
Maybe, like,
a week ago, I think.

01:27:51.788 --> 01:27:54.704
- Is he here often?
- I mean, not really.

01:27:55.574 --> 01:27:57.097
Does he stay over?

01:27:57.750 --> 01:27:59.274
I don't think so.

01:28:00.057 --> 01:28:01.798
Hannah, does he stay over?

01:28:01.798 --> 01:28:02.842
I don't know.

01:28:05.497 --> 01:28:07.456
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

01:28:07.456 --> 01:28:09.327
- I love you.
- Love you!

01:28:09.327 --> 01:28:11.634
I'll bring you back
something cool from France.

01:28:11.634 --> 01:28:13.375
Hi.
Hi.

01:28:13.375 --> 01:28:14.898
How was the place?

01:28:14.898 --> 01:28:17.335
Yeah, you know, it was nice.

01:28:17.335 --> 01:28:19.337
- Good location.
- Good.

01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:21.992
I don't think Sophie
really liked it.

01:28:21.992 --> 01:28:26.562
She kept asking, "Why don't you
just move back in with us?"

01:28:26.562 --> 01:28:28.477
Yeah.

01:28:28.477 --> 01:28:30.000
And cost-wise, good?

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:31.784
You know,
between the settlement

01:28:31.784 --> 01:28:34.700
from Osler and the book deal,
I should be fine.

01:28:35.875 --> 01:28:39.314
- More than fine, actually.
- Okay, great.

01:28:41.011 --> 01:28:44.362
Have you been seeing me in
your dreams lately, by the way?

01:28:45.102 --> 01:28:47.713
No. Why do you
keep asking?

01:28:48.105 --> 01:28:49.498
I'm just curious.

01:28:50.586 --> 01:28:52.718
- Shit, I'm late.
- Where are you going?

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:55.330
Well, I've got a Zoom call
with the publisher.

01:28:55.330 --> 01:28:57.462
They're trying
to expand the tour.

01:28:57.462 --> 01:29:00.596
I might be a whole month
now in Paris.

01:29:00.596 --> 01:29:02.467
- It's crazy.
- That's exciting.

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:08.734
I guess I won't see you
before you leave, then?

01:29:08.734 --> 01:29:11.302
I leave in four days.
I can swing by.

01:29:33.759 --> 01:29:35.761
No, it's fine.
I'll see you when you're back.

01:29:38.547 --> 01:29:40.592
Yeah. Okay.

01:29:44.553 --> 01:29:45.945
Bye.

01:29:47.643 --> 01:29:49.079
Bye, Paul.

01:30:21.938 --> 01:30:24.157
- Hey, Paul.

01:30:24.157 --> 01:30:25.768
I love those on you.

01:30:26.986 --> 01:30:29.424
Hey, come on, try them out.
Dance with me.

01:30:30.468 --> 01:30:32.122
Get out.

01:30:32.122 --> 01:30:34.646
- Get out!
- No, no, try to dance.

01:30:38.781 --> 01:30:40.609
Please don't hit Dylan.

01:30:41.958 --> 01:30:44.439
'Cause your punches will
pack more heat with these

01:30:44.439 --> 01:30:48.355
ultra-yummy keto supplements
from Alpha Monster Gains.

01:30:48.355 --> 01:30:50.270
Oh, fuck, let me just
take that again. I'm sorry.

01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:52.359
Your punches will pack
more heat with these

01:30:52.359 --> 01:30:55.362
ultra-yummy keto supplements
from Ultra Yummy...

01:30:55.362 --> 01:30:56.886
- Oh, fuck.
- Wait a minute.

01:30:56.886 --> 01:30:58.496
Where's the...

01:31:22.389 --> 01:31:24.696
So, first up is a magazine
called Rue Morgue.

01:31:24.696 --> 01:31:27.743
They write about myths, cults,
horror movies, stuff like that.

01:31:27.743 --> 01:31:29.484
Did you bring a copy
of the book?

01:31:29.484 --> 01:31:31.224
No, no. It's going straight
to the stores

01:31:31.224 --> 01:31:32.835
and we'll see it there.

01:31:44.368 --> 01:31:46.196
Can you put it on for me?

01:31:46.501 --> 01:31:48.067
Uh, I'd rather not.

01:31:51.288 --> 01:31:53.464
No, it's just, I don't want to.

01:31:53.682 --> 01:31:55.292
You don't want to?

01:31:55.292 --> 01:31:58.251
The glove is cool and
I think you should wear it.

01:31:58.251 --> 01:31:59.731
Can I say no?

01:31:59.731 --> 01:32:01.516
Come on. It makes sense.

01:32:01.516 --> 01:32:03.518
You are nightmare guy,
it's totally cool.

01:32:19.055 --> 01:32:20.491
<i>Clear your mind.</i>

01:32:20.491 --> 01:32:22.580
<i>And this is the most
important step.</i>

01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:25.496
<i>Set an intention
for your visitation.</i>

01:32:25.496 --> 01:32:26.802
No, it's still
at the store.

01:32:26.802 --> 01:32:28.630
I think they just changed
the room or something.

01:32:29.544 --> 01:32:31.067
Maybe they needed
a bigger space.

01:32:31.067 --> 01:32:32.590
<i>To successfully enter</i>

01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:36.115
<i>someone's dream is gonna
require a lot of practice.</i>

01:32:36.115 --> 01:32:38.596
<i>Getting the Norio
is just the first step.</i>

01:32:38.596 --> 01:32:40.337
Ah, <i>bonjour,</i> Paul.

01:32:42.295 --> 01:32:44.950
<i>Bonjour.</i>
Wow, big turnout.

01:32:45.690 --> 01:32:48.693
Oh, uh, no,
that is for the other event.

01:32:48.693 --> 01:32:50.390
I... I... I'm so sorry.

01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:51.653
There was a conflict.

01:32:51.653 --> 01:32:53.785
Um, they had to move
you downstairs,

01:32:53.785 --> 01:32:55.961
but come, come, this way.

01:32:59.008 --> 01:33:00.705
Voila.
This is it.

01:33:01.924 --> 01:33:03.926
- Is that the book?
- Hmm.

01:33:04.361 --> 01:33:07.016
I haven't actually seen
a physical copy of it yet.

01:33:12.064 --> 01:33:13.283
Okay.

01:33:13.283 --> 01:33:14.850
Wow. It's so thin.

01:33:15.285 --> 01:33:17.766
Must have gotten shorter
in translation.

01:33:20.072 --> 01:33:22.292
They changed the title, too?

01:33:22.292 --> 01:33:23.989
I Am Your Nightmare.

01:33:23.989 --> 01:33:26.644
- That... that is not the title?
- No.

01:33:27.645 --> 01:33:29.734
It was supposed to be
<i>Dream Scenario.</i>

01:33:31.301 --> 01:33:33.999
But this is...
this is fine, I guess.

01:33:35.131 --> 01:33:37.046
Yeah, it's... it's fine.

01:33:37.655 --> 01:33:40.092
It probably works better
for the demographic.

01:33:46.316 --> 01:33:47.970
<i>Who do I make it out to?</i>

01:33:53.671 --> 01:33:55.194
- Fuck!

01:33:55.194 --> 01:33:56.935
Shit. Fuck.

01:33:56.935 --> 01:33:59.503
Are you all right? Jean!

01:33:59.982 --> 01:34:02.071
Fuck, where'd
he go? Jean!

01:34:03.725 --> 01:34:05.204
Fuck.

01:34:15.737 --> 01:34:18.130
<i>Hey guys, it's Liam.
Today, I'll be teaching you</i>

01:34:18.130 --> 01:34:22.395
<i>how to enter someone else's
dream using the Norio.</i>

01:34:22.744 --> 01:34:24.659
<i>Think of it as a meditation.</i>

01:34:24.659 --> 01:34:27.749
<i>Close your eyes,
relax your body,</i>

01:34:27.749 --> 01:34:31.317
<i>and hyper-focus
on the person whose dream</i>

01:34:31.317 --> 01:34:32.623
<i>you're trying to enter.</i>

01:34:33.929 --> 01:34:36.279
<i>Try to pick someone
who welcomes your presence,</i>

01:34:37.367 --> 01:34:38.498
<i>or else this whole thing</i>

01:34:38.498 --> 01:34:40.109
<i>will be pretty much impossible.</i>

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:44.287
<i>So, once you have
your dreamer locked in,</i>

01:34:44.287 --> 01:34:45.941
<i>the Norio will do the rest...</i>

01:35:58.970 --> 01:36:00.798
