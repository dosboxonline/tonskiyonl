WEBVTT

01:54.323 --> 01:55.866
Look over there!

02:10.005 --> 02:12.091
I got it good.

02:12.174 --> 02:14.218
You got lucky, motherfucker.

02:23.435 --> 02:24.687
Hey, what do you think it is?

02:26.230 --> 02:27.439
I'll open it.

02:27.523 --> 02:29.358
- Hector.
- What, boss?

02:29.441 --> 02:32.069
- Check everything.
- Yes.

02:34.905 --> 02:35.990
Take it out.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.833
Motherfucker, it's heavy!

02:58.345 --> 03:00.347
Something heavy is inside.

04:16.173 --> 04:18.968
Why don't you shoot it already, man?

04:19.051 --> 04:20.344
We don't know what's inside.

04:20.427 --> 04:21.845
You want me to get the lock cutters?

04:21.929 --> 04:23.097
Go!

04:49.623 --> 04:51.625
Miss, let's talk.

05:10.352 --> 05:14.815
What the fuck do you got in here?

05:14.898 --> 05:17.735
All your fucking shoes and bags?

07:48.302 --> 07:49.928
How is Hector?

07:56.018 --> 07:57.728
This is Hector's truck, no?

08:02.065 --> 08:03.150
Yes.

09:29.778 --> 09:31.196
May I join you?

09:47.963 --> 09:49.548
That's really spicy.

10:49.191 --> 10:50.192
Fucking gringa bitch!

10:50.275 --> 10:53.195
Relax! She just arrived in the country.

10:53.278 --> 10:54.863
She didn't mean it.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.031
I'll fuck her up!

10:56.114 --> 10:58.200
Come on, chill.
We don't want any problems.

13:35.774 --> 13:38.985
Abril, what did I tell you
about reading this trash?!

13:39.069 --> 13:40.070
It's not.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.613
You hid them under your bed, didn't you?

13:43.782 --> 13:46.284
- Go wash the dishes!
- You don't have to yell at me, okay?

13:46.368 --> 13:48.370
Just stop this shit!

15:08.366 --> 15:10.368
Do you want an Olympic medal?

15:18.752 --> 15:20.378
Don't worry, I'll be there.

15:21.630 --> 15:23.089
Yes, I'll leave shortly.

15:23.173 --> 15:24.591
Okay, bye.

17:32.135 --> 17:33.553
Did you lose something, lady?

17:52.906 --> 17:55.033
Take the lady to the toilet.

18:23.269 --> 18:25.063
If you turn it off again,
I'll kick your...

18:26.231 --> 18:28.525
This is uncle Julio's
new gringa girlfriend.

18:29.526 --> 18:30.735
She needs to use the toilet.

18:33.238 --> 18:34.364
Hello.

18:35.490 --> 18:36.741
Follow me.

18:43.248 --> 18:45.416
I'm not gonna beg. Come here.

18:45.500 --> 18:47.794
I won't hurt you.

18:50.255 --> 18:53.466
Grandpa. Grandpa.

18:53.550 --> 18:55.552
This is Julio's new gringa girlfriend.

18:57.554 --> 18:59.013
She's very pretty, no?

19:00.014 --> 19:01.182
A gringa...

19:03.393 --> 19:05.144
A very good catch!

19:42.891 --> 19:44.350
Do you really need to do that?

19:44.434 --> 19:46.853
He's dead, for Christ's sake.

19:46.936 --> 19:50.732
This fucker got my sister pregnant,
then laughed in her face.

19:52.025 --> 19:53.776
Look who's laughing now.

20:04.579 --> 20:06.956
Sorry I'm late. What do we have?

20:08.541 --> 20:13.171
We found three cartel scumbags
near a smugglers' crashed plane.

20:14.672 --> 20:16.674
- Killed in the crash?
- No.

20:18.051 --> 20:20.845
They most likely arrived
on the scene after the crash.

20:20.929 --> 20:23.932
Whoever was in the plane killed them

20:24.015 --> 20:25.433
and got away.

20:32.440 --> 20:33.608
Fuck.

20:35.777 --> 20:40.406
This is Chief Santiago's
brother-in-law, Hector.

20:40.490 --> 20:42.116
Shit, I didn't recognize him.

20:42.200 --> 20:44.327
The Chief is going to go crazy.

20:44.410 --> 20:46.996
We better ask around,

20:47.080 --> 20:49.082
see if there have been
any new faces in town.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.294
Did you find anything in the plane?

20:53.378 --> 20:55.797
They took whatever they were
carrying with them.

20:55.880 --> 20:57.632
Except what's on the table,
military rations

20:57.715 --> 21:01.719
and a flight manual
in some foreign language.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.245
Where's the gringa?

21:27.328 --> 21:28.913
She's in the bathroom, throwing up.

21:32.125 --> 21:35.336
Stop it! Lucas, give me
the arepa! It's mine!

21:35.420 --> 21:37.171
Sit down!

21:37.255 --> 21:39.882
If he has five arepas,
why does he have to take mine?

21:39.966 --> 21:43.302
Drop it! Why can't we ever have
a peaceful breakfast in this house?

21:43.386 --> 21:45.013
- Idiot.
- What did you say?

21:45.096 --> 21:46.097
Nothing.

22:02.864 --> 22:03.781
Mom?

22:06.576 --> 22:07.994
How do you say <i>orgasmo </i>in English?

22:09.412 --> 22:10.246
What?

22:10.329 --> 22:12.331
<i>Orgasmo </i>in English.

22:14.542 --> 22:15.752
Where did you hear that word?

22:15.835 --> 22:17.503
- In a class.
- A class?

22:17.587 --> 22:19.672
No, no, no. You're too young
for these things, Abril.

22:19.756 --> 22:21.799
Do you even know what that means?

22:21.883 --> 22:24.010
It's when a volcano explodes!

22:24.093 --> 22:25.386
That's my boy!

22:26.387 --> 22:27.472
That's so stupid.

22:27.555 --> 22:30.558
An orgasm is the feeling
when a boy and girl fall in love.

22:30.641 --> 22:31.684
That's a lie!

22:31.768 --> 22:34.437
They're in love.
There is love everywhere.

22:34.520 --> 22:37.398
Didn't you say we didn't know anything?

23:12.058 --> 23:14.811
Once we're in the air, this life
will be behind you.

23:16.312 --> 23:18.272
He will never find you.

24:21.085 --> 24:22.295
Phoenix.

24:23.421 --> 24:25.047
Look at you now.

24:46.319 --> 24:48.321
She woke up.
Bring her a glass of water.

24:50.031 --> 24:51.199
Hello.

24:52.617 --> 24:54.035
Nice to meet you.

25:01.459 --> 25:03.085
You were very dehydrated.

25:04.629 --> 25:06.797
Damn, how do I say it?

25:30.112 --> 25:31.697
Stop being so nosy.

25:47.922 --> 25:49.340
Thank you, Raul.

26:20.955 --> 26:24.375
Tonight I will officially be
a grown woman.

26:26.627 --> 26:29.297
No. That will happen
when you make your own bed.

26:29.380 --> 26:32.300
Red for you, and yellow, right? Yellow.

26:32.383 --> 26:34.385
You have to put it on.

26:53.654 --> 26:55.489
You need to eat too.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.792
You have to try my mom's <i>ají!</i>

27:06.876 --> 27:08.836
It's very good.

27:44.497 --> 27:46.499
Why is everything
always about the <i>señoritas?</i>

27:46.582 --> 27:48.959
I hope the baby is a boy.

28:34.630 --> 28:38.759
The gringa has Latin blood in her veins.

28:38.843 --> 28:42.221
A woman who likes it spicy
is good in the sack.

29:01.073 --> 29:01.991
Boyfriend?

29:02.074 --> 29:04.243
- Yes, my boyfriend.
- What boyfriend, huh?

29:04.326 --> 29:05.703
- He's my boyfriend.
- No, he's not.

29:05.786 --> 29:07.788
You're too young to have a boyfriend.

29:39.778 --> 29:41.989
No, I'll be right there.

29:43.032 --> 29:44.158
What is it?

29:44.241 --> 29:47.536
They arrested two men involved
in the plane crash.

30:01.091 --> 30:03.135
Bye, father.

30:03.219 --> 30:04.887
Kids, please.

30:06.430 --> 30:09.058
My Julio is my favorite son.

30:09.141 --> 30:12.937
Be good to him, or else.

30:14.939 --> 30:15.940
Papa...

30:16.023 --> 30:17.983
he's your only son.

32:37.665 --> 32:38.874
Well?

32:40.501 --> 32:44.171
Nothing. They swear they know nothing
about the plane.

32:44.254 --> 32:48.467
They say they're tourists traveling
through Colombia, hitchhiking.

32:48.550 --> 32:50.052
Gringos.

33:31.135 --> 33:32.428
Take him.

34:30.861 --> 34:31.904
Go ahead.

35:03.060 --> 35:05.687
Good morning! How can I help you?

35:08.273 --> 35:09.566
How much is it?

35:09.650 --> 35:11.068
Not for sale.

35:12.069 --> 35:14.404
It needs a new head gasket.

35:14.488 --> 35:16.490
Expensive and takes time.

35:24.748 --> 35:25.833
How long?

35:27.167 --> 35:29.211
Three or four days, or more.

35:36.552 --> 35:39.805
Ten thousand. 24 hours.

35:48.105 --> 35:50.858
Don't worry, pretty lady. I'll fix it.

35:50.941 --> 35:52.025
All good.

38:27.639 --> 38:30.726
I have 40 hours of video.

38:32.144 --> 38:34.354
The De La Cruz cartel
is using the department

38:34.438 --> 38:36.523
as its personal death squad.

38:37.816 --> 38:41.319
Chief Santiago is receiving orders
from Gabriela De La Cruz.

38:42.320 --> 38:43.947
How many men are involved?

38:44.990 --> 38:46.783
Twelve.

38:46.867 --> 38:48.285
They all have blood on their hands.

38:49.536 --> 38:50.829
Even me.

38:51.830 --> 38:53.957
Santiago's a sadistic pig.

38:54.041 --> 38:56.668
He needs to be brought to justice,
and now we have proof.

38:57.753 --> 38:59.254
You did good, Julio.

38:59.337 --> 39:03.759
Internal Affairs will be happy,
as well as our partners in the CIA.

39:06.845 --> 39:07.971
Is this a copy?

39:08.055 --> 39:10.432
Yes.

39:10.515 --> 39:12.184
I want protection for my family.

39:12.267 --> 39:14.436
And entry into the United States.

39:20.525 --> 39:23.361
Of course, as promised.

39:23.445 --> 39:25.363
- But it will take time.
- How long?

39:25.447 --> 39:26.865
- A month.
- A month?

39:33.497 --> 39:35.332
You disappoint me, Officer Peron.

39:36.666 --> 39:38.668
You have betrayed your brothers.

39:40.670 --> 39:42.297
You are not my brothers.

39:44.049 --> 39:46.927
You're fucking animals.

39:47.010 --> 39:49.012
Maybe so. Maybe so.

39:50.388 --> 39:52.474
But the truth is...

39:52.557 --> 39:54.768
we are the lions

39:54.851 --> 39:57.312
at the top of the food chain.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.397
And this is our den.

40:01.274 --> 40:02.400
I have to say,

40:02.484 --> 40:05.904
you must have big balls
to make those recordings.

40:10.450 --> 40:11.868
That is why...

40:13.203 --> 40:14.454
your balls...

40:15.705 --> 40:17.916
I will remove first.

40:19.960 --> 40:21.753
And when I am done,

40:21.837 --> 40:23.171
these men...

40:23.255 --> 40:25.423
will all take a piece.

40:25.507 --> 40:26.758
A finger.

40:26.842 --> 40:28.260
A hand.

40:29.845 --> 40:31.054
A foot.

40:32.973 --> 40:35.225
So if you want to save your family...

40:35.308 --> 40:36.893
you're gonna tell me...

40:36.977 --> 40:39.646
where the copies are.

40:41.273 --> 40:43.108
And if you refuse, it's all right.

40:43.191 --> 40:45.485
These men will go to your house,

40:45.569 --> 40:47.445
and in front of the little kids,

40:47.529 --> 40:49.656
they will rape your niece

40:49.739 --> 40:53.368
and your pregnant sister.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.870
And I can assure you,

40:56.079 --> 40:59.291
they will suffer terrible deaths.

41:03.670 --> 41:05.088
And nobody can stop me.

42:36.346 --> 42:40.475
Lucas, take your sister into the kitchen

42:40.558 --> 42:42.435
and stay there.

42:42.519 --> 42:44.396
No matter what happens.

44:16.237 --> 44:18.782
Hey, we got the laptop.

44:18.865 --> 44:21.576
<i>Good. Did they get the message?</i>

44:21.659 --> 44:23.286
Yes, sir, they got it.

44:23.370 --> 44:25.288
<i>Good. Good.</i>

44:25.372 --> 44:27.374
<i>- Navarro?</i>
- Yes?

44:27.457 --> 44:31.878
Show those fuckers at Internal Affairs
who they're messing with.

44:33.797 --> 44:35.215
Kill them all.

44:36.966 --> 44:38.885
Yes, sir.

44:42.514 --> 44:43.598
Let's move!

44:45.350 --> 44:46.935
Bastard motherfuckers!

44:56.277 --> 44:57.570
Fucking bitch!

46:47.972 --> 46:49.182
Where is everyone?

46:51.643 --> 46:53.019
They're at the house, sir.

46:53.102 --> 46:55.355
If they're at the house,
then why are you here?

46:57.190 --> 46:58.608
They're dead.

46:59.901 --> 47:01.277
All dead.

47:04.113 --> 47:05.698
Did you get the computer?

47:07.909 --> 47:08.910
Martinez had it.

47:08.993 --> 47:10.036
Motherfucker!

47:10.119 --> 47:11.746
How could this happen?

47:11.829 --> 47:14.958
We were attacked, Commander.

47:15.041 --> 47:16.501
Some gringa bitch came out of the house.

47:16.584 --> 47:19.921
Navarro gave the order
and the next thing I know...

47:20.004 --> 47:22.340
she's firing on us
and it all went to hell!

47:24.801 --> 47:25.969
A gringa?

47:28.137 --> 47:29.430
Are you fucking kidding me?

47:40.567 --> 47:42.068
Chago, let's go.

47:45.321 --> 47:46.322
Commander!

47:48.116 --> 47:51.160
She killed six men in broad daylight.

47:51.244 --> 47:53.830
Cut us down like nothing.

47:54.831 --> 47:57.667
Very well. Enrico, stay with Sanchez.

47:57.750 --> 47:59.794
Chago, close the road to the house.

47:59.877 --> 48:00.920
Nobody gets in or out!

48:01.004 --> 48:02.338
Where are you going, Commander?

48:02.422 --> 48:05.425
I want to meet this crazy fucking gringa.

50:18.683 --> 50:19.892
Stop! Stop! Stop!

50:22.478 --> 50:24.063
What's going on, officer?

50:24.147 --> 50:25.732
You can't come through here.

50:25.815 --> 50:29.360
I'm a doctor and here to visit
the Fuentes family.

50:29.444 --> 50:30.528
Is everything okay?

50:31.821 --> 50:32.989
They're dead.

50:33.072 --> 50:34.741
It was a cartel hit.

50:34.824 --> 50:36.451
So, turn around.

50:40.496 --> 50:43.332
What do you mean dead?
I have to see the family.

50:44.792 --> 50:46.919
Nobody needs a doctor anymore. Understand?

50:47.920 --> 50:49.088
Now get out of here,

50:49.172 --> 50:51.340
or you're gonna need a doctor,
motherfucker.

50:51.424 --> 50:53.009
Go!

53:47.850 --> 53:49.518
<i>I need you to come.</i>

53:51.646 --> 53:52.730
Please.

54:06.202 --> 54:07.620
She wants to talk to you.

54:51.163 --> 54:52.164
<i>I know...</i>

56:13.162 --> 56:16.123
You see, Commander, I was not lying.

56:16.207 --> 56:17.666
Round up the rest of the officers.

56:17.750 --> 56:18.918
I want everyone here pronto.

56:19.001 --> 56:21.796
I'll call headquarters to send
additional reinforcements.

56:21.879 --> 56:24.090
Are you serious?
Because of some fucking gringa.

56:25.174 --> 56:26.926
This is no ordinary gringa.

58:05.566 --> 58:08.068
<i>Commander Santiago,</i>
<i>the reinforcements have arrived.</i>

58:08.152 --> 58:09.987
<i>They await your orders.</i>

58:11.697 --> 58:13.324
<i>Very good. I'll be right there.</i>

58:59.119 --> 59:01.497
Papa, you're scaring the kids.

59:03.624 --> 59:04.875
Children, why don't you go--

01:00:09.982 --> 01:00:12.151
Thank you for being here
on short notice.

01:00:12.234 --> 01:00:14.778
Hopefully, we can get this over quickly,

01:00:14.862 --> 01:00:16.530
so you can go home.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:19.616
Officer Chago will lead the operation.

01:00:19.700 --> 01:00:21.118
Officer Chago.

01:00:22.536 --> 01:00:27.791
The location is a house,
approximately 500 meters south of here.

01:00:27.875 --> 01:00:31.795
I will take the first team
and advance from the front.

01:00:31.879 --> 01:00:35.341
Second team, led by Officer Enrico,

01:00:35.424 --> 01:00:38.177
will approach the rear of the house.

01:00:38.260 --> 01:00:42.014
Our main threat is a gringa.

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:45.476
Don't be fooled,
she's already killed six officers

01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:48.520
and should be considered
extremely dangerous.

01:00:48.604 --> 01:00:52.066
Once the house
has been cleared of all threats,

01:00:52.149 --> 01:00:58.530
we will find and retrieve a laptop
from this fucking house.

01:00:58.614 --> 01:01:00.824
- Understand?
- Yes, sir!

01:01:02.034 --> 01:01:03.369
You must remember.

01:01:03.452 --> 01:01:06.622
She is a cop killer.

01:01:08.123 --> 01:01:10.542
So take no prisoners.

01:01:51.083 --> 01:01:57.047
When I say take no prisoners.
I mean take no prisoners.

01:01:57.131 --> 01:01:58.298
Yes, sir.

01:01:59.299 --> 01:02:00.551
Okay.

01:02:29.079 --> 01:02:30.873
This was my son.

01:02:30.956 --> 01:02:32.624
Understand?

01:02:34.543 --> 01:02:35.669
I stay here.

01:02:37.421 --> 01:02:39.423
And I will fight.

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:02.488
<i>Commander.</i>
<i>Units one and two in position.</i>

01:03:03.530 --> 01:03:06.575
<i>Ready to move on your order.</i>

01:05:05.027 --> 01:05:06.278
What the fuck is she doing?

01:05:34.181 --> 01:05:35.474
I can't see shit!

01:05:35.557 --> 01:05:36.850
Where the hell did she go?

01:05:41.938 --> 01:05:43.690
What the hell?

01:05:43.774 --> 01:05:45.150
I don't know where she went!

01:06:18.183 --> 01:06:19.559
She's playing with the lights!

01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:21.561
Take them out!

01:07:12.779 --> 01:07:15.365
Second team, advance!

01:07:15.449 --> 01:07:16.825
Someone's messing with the electricity.

01:07:16.908 --> 01:07:19.619
Find the power box and take it out.

01:07:19.703 --> 01:07:22.330
Also send two men in the front, now!

01:07:22.414 --> 01:07:23.582
Copy. On it.

01:09:42.345 --> 01:09:43.972
Get in there.

01:09:45.807 --> 01:09:48.268
Or you can die here.

01:09:48.351 --> 01:09:49.561
You... wait!

01:11:00.131 --> 01:11:01.383
Abril, get down!

01:11:07.180 --> 01:11:10.225
Officer Troya! Herrera! Ortiz!

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:16.398
Okay.

01:11:19.401 --> 01:11:20.568
You want to play?

01:11:21.569 --> 01:11:23.029
I'm gonna fucking destroy you.

01:11:24.948 --> 01:11:26.449
Say hello to my little friend.

01:11:41.006 --> 01:11:43.008
Let's see how you're doing now.

01:12:05.530 --> 01:12:07.699
Every last man standing,
enter the house from the rear.

01:12:07.782 --> 01:12:08.908
Find the family.

01:12:08.992 --> 01:12:11.077
But that fucking gringa is mine.

01:12:47.989 --> 01:12:49.908
I'm going to send you to hell!

01:14:02.438 --> 01:14:03.356
Bitch!

01:14:29.883 --> 01:14:32.844
You fucking gonorrhea,
today is the day you die!

01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:39.767
And when I'm done with you...

01:14:40.768 --> 01:14:42.645
I'm going to fuck your dead body.

01:15:21.684 --> 01:15:25.188
Chago? Enrico? What's going on?

01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:26.898
Report at once!

01:15:53.716 --> 01:15:54.717
Papa.

01:15:59.973 --> 01:16:02.850
Paulina...

01:16:02.934 --> 01:16:05.144
My beautiful daughter.

01:16:07.480 --> 01:16:11.109
I had the most wonderful dream.

01:16:12.694 --> 01:16:15.405
We were at the beach.

01:16:16.948 --> 01:16:20.368
I was thirty again.

01:16:22.328 --> 01:16:24.414
And we were all there.

01:16:25.873 --> 01:16:29.752
Julio... even your mother.

01:16:31.504 --> 01:16:32.964
We were singing...

01:16:33.047 --> 01:16:35.258
and we were dancing.

01:16:36.926 --> 01:16:39.095
We were all happy.

01:16:45.977 --> 01:16:47.061
Look, Papa.

01:16:48.438 --> 01:16:50.440
Your new grandchild.

01:16:52.900 --> 01:16:54.277
It's a boy.

01:16:57.155 --> 01:16:59.574
He's going to be a champion.

01:17:05.663 --> 01:17:08.666
Did we get those bastards?

01:17:10.001 --> 01:17:11.419
Yes, Papa.

01:17:14.047 --> 01:17:15.048
We got them all.

01:17:16.507 --> 01:17:17.717
Good.

01:17:19.218 --> 01:17:22.597
I knew everything would be okay.

01:18:29.455 --> 01:18:31.791
Officer Chago is dead.

01:18:31.874 --> 01:18:34.001
We lost many men.

01:18:36.712 --> 01:18:38.881
Chago is dead.

01:18:38.965 --> 01:18:40.466
<i>We lost many men.</i>

01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:46.139
But the gringa and the family
are dead too.

01:18:48.433 --> 01:18:49.892
The gringa and the family are dead.

01:18:51.686 --> 01:18:54.147
<i>Officer Enrico. Is that you?</i>

01:18:54.230 --> 01:18:55.440
<i>Respond!</i>

01:19:36.481 --> 01:19:39.817
Enrico, Enrico. Respond.

01:19:42.487 --> 01:19:44.906
I need one of you bastards to respond.

01:19:46.199 --> 01:19:47.450
Fuck.

01:21:36.100 --> 01:21:37.184
Commander.

01:21:38.519 --> 01:21:41.188
So far, no sign of the family,
or the gringa.

01:21:41.272 --> 01:21:43.983
They might be under the debris.

01:21:44.066 --> 01:21:45.693
It'll take time to clear everything.

01:21:46.861 --> 01:21:48.696
No, they are gone.

01:21:51.574 --> 01:21:53.743
Some of the officers are missing radios.

01:21:53.826 --> 01:21:56.412
Then change the radio frequency.

01:22:15.431 --> 01:22:18.434
I didn't realize the San Lucas police
had so many men.

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:22.188
The family is being protected
by a gringa.

01:22:22.271 --> 01:22:25.358
I don't know who she is
or where she's from.

01:22:25.441 --> 01:22:26.984
But she did all of this.

01:22:28.527 --> 01:22:30.446
And she has evidence of the crimes
we've committed for you.

01:22:32.323 --> 01:22:33.991
If this goes public...

01:22:34.075 --> 01:22:35.868
the San Lucas police department
is finished.

01:22:36.869 --> 01:22:38.663
It looks like it already is.

01:22:39.664 --> 01:22:42.833
I can offer a reasonable explanation
to the Inspector General,

01:22:42.917 --> 01:22:46.212
but I can't afford to lose any more men.

01:22:49.340 --> 01:22:50.508
Fine.

01:22:51.926 --> 01:22:53.761
You'll have what you need.

01:25:06.477 --> 01:25:09.313
This is Bom Bom. He's my best friend.

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.242
It's good to have a friend.

01:26:43.991 --> 01:26:45.451
Get in quickly.

01:26:55.252 --> 01:26:57.338
He's beautiful.

01:27:05.179 --> 01:27:07.014
Hold on tight.
It's going to get bumpy.

01:28:19.753 --> 01:28:21.755
It's not working!

01:28:52.661 --> 01:28:54.830
I'm a survivor... a warrior.

01:29:00.335 --> 01:29:01.545
I'm a survivor...

01:29:04.256 --> 01:29:05.299
I'm a warrior.

01:29:06.508 --> 01:29:08.218
I'm a warrior!

01:32:24.539 --> 01:32:26.208
<i>Breaking news.</i>

01:32:26.291 --> 01:32:28.627
<i>We've just received exclusive</i>
<i>undercover surveillance video,</i>

01:32:28.710 --> 01:32:31.463

<i>Warning-- these images are disturbing.</i>

01:33:10.669 --> 01:33:13.088
I tried calling her
and she's not picking up!

01:33:13.171 --> 01:33:14.548
You know who I am!

01:33:14.631 --> 01:33:15.674
So, tell her I'm here!

01:33:15.757 --> 01:33:16.842
Commander Santiago.

01:33:17.843 --> 01:33:22.139
I didn't answer you because it's stupid.

01:33:22.222 --> 01:33:26.685
It's stupid to talk
on the phone right now.

01:33:32.899 --> 01:33:34.359
It appears you are a celebrity now.

01:33:34.443 --> 01:33:36.486
Yes. And because of me,

01:33:36.570 --> 01:33:39.323
you sleep with a clean conscience!

01:33:45.871 --> 01:33:46.913
Thank you.

01:33:46.997 --> 01:33:48.498
I sleep like a baby.

01:33:48.582 --> 01:33:51.001
So what can we do for you?

01:33:54.671 --> 01:33:56.715
My family and I have nowhere to go.

01:33:56.798 --> 01:34:00.093
We need help leaving the country!
Anywhere we can disappear!

01:34:06.600 --> 01:34:08.310
Fine.

01:34:08.393 --> 01:34:11.688
You and your family
are welcome to stay here.

01:34:12.689 --> 01:34:16.234
I have over 100 armed men
on the premises,

01:34:16.318 --> 01:34:19.237
anti-aircraft guns, even tanks.

01:34:19.321 --> 01:34:21.156
Nobody will dare come for you here.

01:35:26.304 --> 01:35:28.181
Good morning, Miss.

01:35:28.265 --> 01:35:30.142
Pardon me, the church is closed.
