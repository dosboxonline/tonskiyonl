WEBVTT

00:08.000 --> 00:10.080
[TARDIS whirs]

00:17.240 --> 00:19.680
Gold Protocols, everyone.

00:19.680 --> 00:22.400
Positions. Helipad doors to open.

00:23.800 --> 00:25.680
TARDIS vector one.

00:38.880 --> 00:40.040
Doctor on the bridge.

00:43.880 --> 00:45.840
- Give me the lovin'!
- [laughs]

00:45.840 --> 00:48.480
[laughs] Rose! Rosie!

00:48.480 --> 00:50.840
- Rosa! Rosalinda!
- [Rose] Doctor! At last.

00:50.840 --> 00:52.880
- It's been so long.
- Oh. How is your mum? How's your uncle?

00:52.880 --> 00:55.240
- Yeah, good.
- Oh, good. Ruby, Rose. Rose, Ruby.

00:55.240 --> 00:57.000
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Two different shades of red.

00:57.000 --> 00:58.240
[Kate] Doctor, welcome aboard.

00:58.240 --> 01:00.240
- You're gorgeous. [giggles]
- Thank you. [giggles]

01:00.240 --> 01:01.280
Kate.

01:03.040 --> 01:04.320
Kate.

01:04.320 --> 01:09.600
Ruby, this is Kate. We love Kate.
I knew Kate's dad. He was the best of men.

01:09.600 --> 01:10.680
That is the Vlinx.

01:10.680 --> 01:11.840
Greetings.

01:11.840 --> 01:14.440
Oh. Nice upgrade.

01:14.440 --> 01:16.480
Hot metal, Doctor.

01:16.480 --> 01:17.960
[Doctor] Colonel Ibrahim.

01:17.960 --> 01:19.360
Someone has been working out.

01:19.360 --> 01:22.720
- I try. [chuckles] I get busy, you know?
- [chuckles] Looking good, sir.

01:22.720 --> 01:24.480
[stammers]
Hi. Sorry, I didn't get your name.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.600
Harriet. Head of the Archive.

01:26.600 --> 01:28.000
[Doctor] Harriet, nice to meet you.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.760
And I'm Morris Gibbons,
UNIT Scientific Adviser.

01:30.760 --> 01:34.240
Thirteen years old, accelerated genius,
thanks to a passing asteroid.

01:34.240 --> 01:35.400
Thirteen years old.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.240
- Nice to meet you, Morris Gibbons.
- Nice to meet you.

01:37.240 --> 01:39.080
- Ruby, this is Morris Gibbons.
- [Ruby] Hey. [giggles]

01:39.080 --> 01:40.280
Nice to meet you, Ruby.

01:40.280 --> 01:41.480
Okay.

01:43.240 --> 01:44.320
All of you,

01:45.600 --> 01:46.600
I need your help.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.240
'Cause something really weird
keeps happening.

01:49.240 --> 01:52.880
Everywhere I land, a woman appears. Look.

01:52.880 --> 01:53.960
[the sonic beeps]

01:54.680 --> 01:58.560
So, she is a comms officer
in the planet Pacifico del Rio.

01:58.560 --> 02:00.960
She's someone's mum in Finetime.

02:00.960 --> 02:02.760
She's an ambulance.

02:02.760 --> 02:04.920
She's a portrait in 1813,
and the list goes on.

02:04.920 --> 02:08.720
Planet Sloog, she's a Sloogma.
Planet Varsitay, she is a Griffin.

02:08.720 --> 02:11.600
The Fivefold Configuration, she's a Bleet.
So she's everywhere.

02:11.600 --> 02:13.960
She must be here.

02:13.960 --> 02:17.920
So I'm hoping that UNIT
can find her and analyse her.

02:17.920 --> 02:23.200
She's always middle-aged, about so-high,
60, slim, fair hair.

02:24.960 --> 02:25.960
What?

02:28.360 --> 02:29.520
What? What is it?

02:29.520 --> 02:32.320
- [sighs] And right on cue.
- [button beeps]

02:32.320 --> 02:34.560
- [lecturer] <i>This is when it changes.</i>
- [audience applauding]

02:34.560 --> 02:39.240
<i>This is when the whole world
is changed by me.</i>

02:39.920 --> 02:41.240
[audience cheers]

02:41.240 --> 02:42.920
[lecturer] <i>All right, all right.</i>

02:42.920 --> 02:46.400
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- Susan Triad, IT genius.

02:46.400 --> 02:50.080
And today, she's releasing
her software worldwide, free of charge.

02:50.080 --> 02:53.560
- A gift from S Triad Technology.
- <i>...is greed.</i>

02:53.560 --> 02:56.640
- Oh, man. Don't you see?
- [Susan] <i>It's people in power</i>

02:56.640 --> 02:58.280
<i>clinging on to all that profit.</i>

02:58.280 --> 02:59.760
It's an anagram.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.680
S Triad spells out...

03:02.680 --> 03:04.560
[the sonic whirs]

03:04.560 --> 03:05.640
"TARDIS".

03:05.640 --> 03:08.040
The name is TARDIS Technology.

03:08.840 --> 03:10.560
Well, obviously. Thank you.

03:10.560 --> 03:11.640
Even I got that.

03:11.640 --> 03:13.560
[Morris] That is why
we've been watching her.

03:13.560 --> 03:16.840
'Cause it spells TARDIS.
We know that, but why?

03:16.840 --> 03:19.640
It's not just that. Never mind
the anagram. Look at her name.

03:20.920 --> 03:22.640
Isn't that the point, Doctor?

03:24.800 --> 03:26.320
She's called Susan.

03:26.320 --> 03:27.600
[Kate] Is that significant?

03:28.360 --> 03:30.520
Susan is the name of my granddaughter.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.880
[theme song playing]

04:05.320 --> 04:07.360
<i>It is my honour to be here today...</i>

04:07.360 --> 04:11.040
Susan Triad, entrepreneur,
genius, philanthropist.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.600
She's even been the book
at bedtime on CBeebies.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.240
Three years ago, she launched Triad.

04:16.240 --> 04:20.120
It only rebranded as S Triad Technology
two months ago,

04:20.120 --> 04:22.160
and we were straight onto her.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.600
Well, even without the TARDIS anagram.

04:24.600 --> 04:28.040
Evil genius with secret alien software,
it was top of our list.

04:28.040 --> 04:30.200
God knows we've stopped enough of them.

04:30.200 --> 04:31.800
Well, except the obvious.

04:32.440 --> 04:33.280
We'll get him.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.720
But the research with Susan
has come to nothing.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.400
[Morris] Yeah, and the software's clean.
No secret alien signals.

04:39.400 --> 04:40.960
Kinda disappointed.

04:40.960 --> 04:44.000
But hold on. Excuse me.
Doctor, am I being thick here?

04:44.000 --> 04:46.480
[scoffs] How do you not know
your own granddaughter?

04:46.480 --> 04:48.400
I mean, don't you recognise her?

04:49.240 --> 04:51.880
[chuckles] Um-- [stammers, sighs]

04:53.440 --> 04:54.760
[chuckles] Okay.

04:58.120 --> 04:59.120
[sighs]

05:00.360 --> 05:05.600
The truth is, Time Lords can regenerate
their faces like a disguise.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.960
So we look different,
but we're still the same.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.080
Right. [chuckles] Okay.

05:12.280 --> 05:13.280
But what for?

05:13.280 --> 05:15.320
It can save us if we're dying.

05:15.840 --> 05:19.280
- [Susan chattering on monitor]
- Or sometimes we can hide ourselves away...

05:19.280 --> 05:21.080
<i>...to be able to make a global difference.</i>

05:21.080 --> 05:22.360
[Doctor] ...with a new face.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.040
<i>And that is what I intend.</i>

05:24.040 --> 05:25.520
Does that sound mad?

05:25.520 --> 05:28.600
- <i>Triad can make a difference.</i>
- Just don't go changing yours, okay?

05:28.600 --> 05:32.960
Oh, no. I'm keeping this one
for a long, long time.

05:32.960 --> 05:35.280
But is this her actual face,
or did she choose it?

05:35.280 --> 05:37.880
Name, anagram, TARDIS.

05:38.560 --> 05:41.840
Probability of a trap, 95% and rising.

05:41.840 --> 05:44.440
[Susan] <i>Because this is
the start of a better future.</i>

05:44.440 --> 05:47.360
<i>A prosperous future for everyone.</i>

05:47.360 --> 05:52.640
[audience chanting] <i>Susan, Susan,
Susan, Susan, Susan.</i>

05:52.640 --> 05:54.760
That's a bit mad, isn't it?
Chanting my name?

05:54.760 --> 05:56.240
I'm not BeyoncÃ©.

05:56.240 --> 05:57.360
[applause, chanting stops]

05:57.360 --> 06:00.560
[scoffs] I don't like it.
Can't we just pipe in a bit of applause?

06:00.560 --> 06:02.080
Oh, it was just a rehearsal.

06:02.080 --> 06:03.960
We hacked the link.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.160
That's Triad HQ, one mile west of us.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.920
She goes live at 1500 to the whole world.

06:09.520 --> 06:10.840
We're not fooling anyone.

06:10.840 --> 06:12.280
The shareholders like it.

06:12.960 --> 06:14.560
[groans] What do you think, Mel?

06:15.960 --> 06:17.240
Well, it got me cheering.

06:17.240 --> 06:20.160
- Oh, that's Mel! That's my mate Mel.
- [chattering on monitor]

06:20.160 --> 06:23.120
- Oh, you would love Mel. Bonkers.
- [chuckles]

06:23.120 --> 06:25.400
[Kate] We got her undercover
on the media team,

06:25.400 --> 06:27.560
and she's discovered one surprising thing.

06:28.080 --> 06:31.400
Susan Triad turns out to be really nice.

06:33.080 --> 06:36.720
I wish we had a real crowd.
It's hard to find the right pitch.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.280
- Thanks, Mel.
- Okay.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.240
Am I going to sound all grandiose?

06:40.240 --> 06:42.040
[aide] No. You sound celebratory.

06:42.040 --> 06:45.800
You're giving a gift to the whole planet.
You're allowed to enjoy yourself.

06:45.800 --> 06:49.200
It's gonna be brilliant, Susan.
I wanted to cheer.

06:49.200 --> 06:51.960
[chuckles] Call me Sue, pet.
Everyone does.

06:51.960 --> 06:52.880
Thank you, Sue.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.320
No rest for the wicked.

06:54.320 --> 06:56.160
- Two hours till the big one.
- [aide] Mm-hmm.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.280
Come on.
I wanna rewrite that middle section.

06:58.280 --> 06:59.200
[aide] Okay.

06:59.200 --> 07:00.640
[Doctor] <i>So we have Susan Triad.</i>

07:01.880 --> 07:06.280
We also have another mystery woman, hmm?

07:08.680 --> 07:09.680
[the sonic whirs]

07:11.080 --> 07:14.240
- Ruby Sunday!
- [Ruby laughs] Oh, you could've warned me.

07:14.240 --> 07:17.360
- That's amazing. You look gorgeous.
- Oh, that's my sixteenth. [laughs]

07:17.360 --> 07:20.440
Okay, so Ruby is not
the mystery woman, but your mother is.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.720
Ruby is a foundling
and was left on Ruby Road.

07:22.720 --> 07:25.800
We've got your history,
after that incursion on December 24th,

07:25.800 --> 07:27.360
filed under "goblins".

07:27.360 --> 07:28.840
- Harriet.
- [button beeps]

07:28.840 --> 07:31.280
You were quite famous for a day or two.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.880
The Christmas baby.

07:33.880 --> 07:35.960
[Ruby] Oh, yeah.
We tried to find my mum, but--

07:35.960 --> 07:38.160
Actually we even tried Davina McCall,
but we got nothing.

07:38.160 --> 07:39.360
Ah, I love Davina.

07:39.360 --> 07:42.000
- [Rose, Ruby chuckle]
- I love Davina. Is she nice?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.720
[exclaims] She's absolutely lovely.

07:43.720 --> 07:44.920
That's one good thing.

07:44.920 --> 07:47.120
- [Doctor, Ruby laugh]
- [Rose] She's so cool.

07:47.120 --> 07:50.640
So-- Sorry. You've got, uh,
a woman that you keep seeing

07:50.640 --> 07:53.240
and a woman that you've never seen.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.520
Is it the same woman?

07:55.520 --> 07:59.960
Susan Triad would've been 40, 42,
and women who abandon their children

07:59.960 --> 08:02.840
tend to be teenagers
or early 20s, statistically.

08:02.840 --> 08:05.440
Sorry, but can I say the obvious?

08:05.440 --> 08:08.840
You've got a time machine. Doctor,
can't you just go back and take a look?

08:08.840 --> 08:10.520
No. No. I can't.

08:10.520 --> 08:13.200
I've been to Ruby Road once,
and I can't cross over my own history.

08:13.200 --> 08:17.040
The one night that we need to see,
and I have time-locked myself out of it.

08:17.040 --> 08:19.600
That's not like you.
You love to break the rules.

08:20.520 --> 08:22.000
Yeah, but...

08:24.120 --> 08:25.520
it snows.

08:25.520 --> 08:26.600
It snows?

08:26.600 --> 08:28.000
Oh, it really snows.

08:28.000 --> 08:29.960
It was snowing
the night that Ruby was born,

08:29.960 --> 08:31.800
and it keeps snowing all around her.

08:31.800 --> 08:36.880
Actual snow, which means that
that night is so raw and so open,

08:36.880 --> 08:39.800
the last thing that I should do
is take a time machine back there.

08:39.800 --> 08:43.960
Excuse me. It all sounds
a bit Dickensian with the baby

08:43.960 --> 08:46.760
and the church and the snow,
but it was 2004.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.720
There was CCTV footage.

08:48.720 --> 08:52.600
The camera was positioned
in a storage yard 66 metres away.

08:52.600 --> 08:55.080
But does it show anything?
Does the tape still exist?

08:55.080 --> 08:57.000
Oh, no, no. We've got it.
Yeah, my gran asked for it,

08:57.000 --> 09:00.200
'cause it's mine, and it's all I've got,
but you can't see anything.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.320
It's black and white,
and snow at midnight--

09:02.320 --> 09:04.520
Yeah. Yeah, but look at our technology.

09:04.520 --> 09:06.200
We can sharpen the image.

09:08.120 --> 09:09.480
Oh, my God. [chuckles]

09:10.440 --> 09:12.720
Do you think you can clean it up?
I can see my mother.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.840
[squeals] Okay.
Well, um, it's at home, the VHS.

09:17.840 --> 09:19.680
My mum's got it. She's got it in a box.

09:19.680 --> 09:21.840
I suggest we take Miss Sunday home.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.000
- At once, ma'am.
- [Ruby giggling]

09:24.000 --> 09:25.160
- This way.
- Thank you.

09:25.160 --> 09:26.240
Oh. I'm coming too.

09:26.240 --> 09:28.800
- [exclaims] It's like we're on a mission.
- [chuckles] I know.

09:28.800 --> 09:30.600
They never give me proper work.

09:30.600 --> 09:33.160
They have me investigating
shoplifting in Catford.

09:44.040 --> 09:45.040
[beeps]

09:47.640 --> 09:49.640
[aide] "I want Triad to be in every home.

09:49.640 --> 09:52.840
At the heart of every family,
365 days a year."

09:52.840 --> 09:55.040
I took out that bit
about coals to Newcastle.

09:55.040 --> 09:57.160
- Hmm.
- Doesn't really work in China.

09:57.160 --> 10:00.520
Hi. Don't wanna interrupt.
I got those figures from Hanya.

10:01.040 --> 10:05.320
She is so happy.
I have never seen anyone smile so much.

10:05.320 --> 10:07.800
- [aide laughs]
- [laughs] You okay? All good?

10:07.800 --> 10:11.200
- Oh, just terrified, that's all.
- You'll be amazing.

10:11.200 --> 10:12.760
I don't know
how you think of all this stuff.

10:12.760 --> 10:15.360
[chuckles] Good mum and dad, that's how.

10:15.880 --> 10:19.400
I mean, we didn't have much.
He was a postman. She was a dinner lady.

10:19.400 --> 10:21.520
But they told me, "You can do anything."

10:22.200 --> 10:23.520
And look at me now.

10:23.520 --> 10:26.160
Ninety minutes' time,
I address the United Nations.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.600
- [laughs]
- Best of luck, Sue.

10:29.360 --> 10:30.160
[beeps]

10:44.320 --> 10:46.800
[Carla] Here it is. Safe and sound.

10:46.800 --> 10:48.280
That's your story, darling.

10:48.280 --> 10:50.160
The legend of Ruby Sunday.

10:50.160 --> 10:51.800
But they can analyse it.

10:52.320 --> 10:54.960
Maybe we can see my birth mother.
If we can see her face just once.

10:54.960 --> 10:56.520
[Rose] They've got amazing technology.

10:56.520 --> 10:58.600
I mean, it can do anything.

10:58.600 --> 10:59.760
You work for UNIT?

10:59.760 --> 11:01.240
My mother's part of it.

11:01.840 --> 11:03.120
Is she?

11:04.480 --> 11:07.440
Well, if your mother's part of it,

11:08.400 --> 11:11.680
then, Ruby,
you can tell her your mother is too.

11:11.680 --> 11:13.080
Now go and get Mrs Flood.

11:13.080 --> 11:16.520
- What for?
- Go and get her!

11:16.520 --> 11:19.760
Vamoose! 'Cause I'm coming with you
to the nitwit tower!

11:21.800 --> 11:23.800
[radio host] <i>There's a warning
of thunderstorms across...</i>

11:23.800 --> 11:26.400
Anything I can do to help.

11:27.080 --> 11:29.480
Uh, it's nice for me to get out.

11:29.480 --> 11:33.400
I'm always hiding myself away. [chuckles]

11:33.400 --> 11:36.920
I just need you to look after Mum.
It's only gonna be for a couple of hours.

11:36.920 --> 11:39.000
Oh, leave her to me.

11:39.000 --> 11:43.440
I nursed my old mum through diabetes
and a hip operation.

11:43.440 --> 11:45.480
She died of an ulcer.

11:46.120 --> 11:48.080
But that was when I wasn't looking.

11:50.800 --> 11:52.480
[smacks lips] Aren't you a beauty?

11:53.360 --> 11:54.440
- Thank you.
- [chuckles]

11:55.160 --> 11:56.520
You too, Ruby.

11:56.520 --> 11:59.520
- [chuckles]
- Still hoping for that growth spurt?

11:59.520 --> 12:00.880
Oh.

12:00.880 --> 12:03.040
[Carla] Mum,
I'm leaving you with Mrs Flood.

12:03.040 --> 12:06.240
You've got your pills.
Two yellow tablets at five o'clock.

12:06.240 --> 12:10.160
If you're chasing after that Doctor man,
I'm warning you. Him is trouble.

12:10.160 --> 12:11.880
Everything is trouble.

12:11.880 --> 12:14.920
And I've decided it's about time
I cause trouble for myself.

12:16.280 --> 12:17.320
Thank you, Mrs F.

12:17.920 --> 12:20.120
Come on, girls. Let's find that woman.

12:20.120 --> 12:21.200
[door opens]

12:22.680 --> 12:23.720
[door closes]

12:24.800 --> 12:27.000
I would love a cup of tea.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.080
Would you, sweetheart?

12:29.080 --> 12:33.240
Well, we'd all like a lot of things
that aren't going to happen.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.720
What that supposed to mean?

12:35.720 --> 12:39.200
I'd be very careful, Mrs Sunday.

12:39.200 --> 12:41.680
There's a storm coming in.

12:41.680 --> 12:43.440
[thunder rumbling]

12:48.600 --> 12:50.120
He waits no more.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.440
[rumbling continues]

12:52.440 --> 12:53.920
[wind howling]

12:58.960 --> 13:00.840
[footsteps approaching]

13:05.240 --> 13:06.440
[sighs, inhales sharply]

13:06.440 --> 13:10.560
My father, he'd tell me stories about you
when I was a kid.

13:11.920 --> 13:14.160
[chuckles]
He'd sit there in the firelight,

13:14.160 --> 13:18.320
telling tales of the Doctor,
his eyes shining.

13:20.680 --> 13:24.120
But he never ever mentioned
a granddaughter.

13:24.120 --> 13:26.280
I was a different Doctor back then, Kate.

13:26.840 --> 13:28.480
- [inhales sharply]
- The Great enigma.

13:28.480 --> 13:31.120
Still can't shake it off. I'm trying.

13:31.120 --> 13:33.960
If you've got a granddaughter,
that means you've got kids.

13:33.960 --> 13:35.840
Well, not quite.

13:36.400 --> 13:37.760
Not yet.

13:37.760 --> 13:40.600
But-- You mean you can have
a granddaughter before a daughter?

13:40.600 --> 13:42.160
Life of a Time Lord.

13:43.480 --> 13:44.480
But--

13:45.280 --> 13:46.280
[stammers] Okay.

13:46.280 --> 13:49.240
The grandchild exists,
and you've got the TARDIS,

13:49.240 --> 13:51.760
but you've never gone back to see her.
Why not?

13:55.800 --> 13:56.880
You've seen my life.

13:58.440 --> 14:00.840
I bring disaster, Kate.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.160
- [inhales sharply]
- Disaster.

14:03.720 --> 14:06.120
What if I go back and ruin her?

14:08.960 --> 14:11.120
For what it's worth,
I think you bring joy.

14:13.640 --> 14:14.640
Hmm?

14:17.160 --> 14:19.160
Do you think Susan Triad is her?

14:19.880 --> 14:21.440
Do you want it to be?

14:21.440 --> 14:23.360
Doctor, what if you just said hello?

14:23.360 --> 14:24.760
To her face.

14:26.080 --> 14:27.840
Look her in the eye.
Would you recognise her?

14:27.840 --> 14:28.920
Yes.

14:32.120 --> 14:34.680
Yes, but S Triad Technology, the anagram...

14:36.160 --> 14:39.640
Like Morris said, probability of a trap,
95%.

14:40.160 --> 14:41.680
- Ninety-six.
- Ninety--

14:42.880 --> 14:45.680
[laughs] You see? I can't.

14:46.760 --> 14:48.640
[inhales deeply, sighs]

14:50.160 --> 14:51.840
Come here. Come on.

14:55.480 --> 14:56.880
[Mel] I'll have some of that.

14:58.960 --> 15:00.440
[laughs]

15:01.160 --> 15:02.960
[laughs]

15:04.760 --> 15:06.120
- Oh!
- Oh, yes!

15:06.120 --> 15:08.120
- Hello, trouble. [chuckles]
- [laughs]

15:08.120 --> 15:09.200
Come on, you two.

15:11.000 --> 15:14.760
In 65 minutes, it's 1500 UK time.

15:14.760 --> 15:16.360
10:00 a.m. in the USA.

15:16.360 --> 15:19.640
That's when Susan Triad addresses
the United Nations.

15:19.640 --> 15:23.600
And I've got my daily DNA sample
which says that Susan Triad is...

15:23.600 --> 15:25.120
[console beeping]

15:25.120 --> 15:28.480
Susan Triad. Human confirmed.

15:28.480 --> 15:30.800
- But we know that already, don't we?
- Mmm.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.640
Kate's got a chrysalis theory.

15:33.160 --> 15:36.760
Uh, just because Susan Triad is nice
doesn't mean she can't change.

15:36.760 --> 15:38.840
A caterpillar doesn't know
it's a butterfly.

15:38.840 --> 15:41.680
And a phoenix is just a bird
until it burns.

15:41.680 --> 15:43.600
I got it! I got it, I got it, I got it!

15:43.600 --> 15:44.680
[laughs]

15:45.280 --> 15:46.280
Whoo! [sighs]

15:46.280 --> 15:48.760
But they stuck Mum in a room downstairs.
They won't let her in.

15:48.760 --> 15:50.840
Ruby, this is
a Gold Security establishment.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.280
Even the prime minister
can't walk into UNIT.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.200
Especially the prime minister.

15:55.200 --> 15:57.080
Yeah, but it's Carla. Come on.

15:57.080 --> 15:59.400
[system voice]
<i>Carla Sunday. Access granted.</i>

15:59.400 --> 16:01.040
Right. Fine. Thanks.

16:01.040 --> 16:02.480
Hey. And this.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.800
This is the key!

16:04.800 --> 16:07.440
Ah! We are not just gonna analyse this.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.880
Kate, do you have a Time Window?

16:10.880 --> 16:13.280
Wh-- You expressly told us in the 1970s,

16:13.280 --> 16:16.000
UNIT was absolutely forbidden
to experiment with

16:16.000 --> 16:17.560
any form of time technology.

16:17.560 --> 16:20.080
- Do you have a Time Window?
- Ten floors down.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.160
[Ruby exclaims]

16:22.840 --> 16:24.000
[keypad beeps]

16:32.080 --> 16:33.800

<i>Relative temporal distortion

16:57.160 --> 17:01.880
[laughing]

17:01.880 --> 17:04.080
This is-- This is rough.

17:05.600 --> 17:08.440
Wow. You have lashed this together.

17:09.320 --> 17:12.480
Whoo! [laughs] Oh, wow. Ouch!

17:12.480 --> 17:13.680
Ouch. Kate.

17:13.680 --> 17:17.920
Doctor, this is Colonel Winston Chidozie,
head of Time Window Security.

17:17.920 --> 17:20.760
An honour to work with you, sir.
I've heard so much about ya.

17:20.760 --> 17:22.160
'Ey, is that a Manchester accent?

17:22.160 --> 17:25.320
- Proud to say, ma'am. Cheetham Hill.
- Oh, I'm Ruby. I'm from Tameside.

17:25.320 --> 17:26.800
- Good to meet you, ma'am.
- [laughs]

17:26.800 --> 17:32.200
So-- So, this room charges up
using the entire nuclear output of Europe

17:32.200 --> 17:35.120
and projects an image
from the past, like 3D history?

17:35.920 --> 17:37.480
Well, we-we get glimpses.

17:37.480 --> 17:39.600
Little, fleeting moments.

17:39.600 --> 17:42.160
We saw the signing of
the Declaration of Independence,

17:42.160 --> 17:44.840
but all I could tell you was
the colour of the quill.

17:44.840 --> 17:46.480
Which was white.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.320
We've got extra power.

17:50.240 --> 17:53.880
We can feed the Time Window
using massive information from the VHS.

17:53.880 --> 17:56.560
Actual positions of the snowflakes.

17:56.560 --> 17:57.720
Morris Gibbons?

17:59.520 --> 18:00.520
Yes, Doc?

18:00.520 --> 18:03.000
Get this VHS wired up to that system,

18:03.000 --> 18:07.880
because we are going to recreate
Christmas Eve 2004.

18:07.880 --> 18:08.960
Come on!

18:11.200 --> 18:13.280
[VHS player beeps, clicks]

18:15.400 --> 18:16.560
[Doctor] There it is.

18:17.160 --> 18:18.400
The legend.

18:18.400 --> 18:19.480
[Ruby chuckles]

18:20.800 --> 18:23.120
Me and my mum watch it
every Christmas Eve.

18:23.120 --> 18:26.280
Like a little sort of ritual.
But you can't see anything.

18:26.280 --> 18:28.560
The CCTV wasn't even
pointing at the church.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.720
No, but the information exists.

18:30.720 --> 18:33.640
We can see that snowflakes fell
on a south-east axis,

18:33.640 --> 18:37.640
so we can model that onto the church
and predict backwards.

18:37.640 --> 18:38.720
Ah.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.720
Oh, my God. Mum! [chuckles]

18:42.520 --> 18:45.720
[sighs] This place is insane, Ruby.

18:45.720 --> 18:47.280
How much did it all cost?

18:47.280 --> 18:48.640
- [Doctor] Hey. All good.
- [chuckles]

18:48.640 --> 18:50.200
Right. This might get noisy.

18:50.200 --> 18:52.920
Direct all comms traffic through me.

18:53.520 --> 18:54.600
Now, stay back!

18:54.600 --> 18:55.720
Behind the glass.

18:55.720 --> 18:57.760
Everyone, keep the chamber clear.

18:58.280 --> 19:00.400
We are going to rock through time.

19:01.680 --> 19:03.200
I don't wanna lose anyone.

19:04.000 --> 19:06.080
Ruby! [chuckles]

19:07.600 --> 19:08.960
Look after her.

19:12.000 --> 19:13.560
[Mel] Don't worry. She's safe.

19:13.560 --> 19:16.640
I lost my family
to the most terrible things.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.880
[inhales deeply] But the Doctor helped me.

19:20.320 --> 19:21.480
I swear. Come on.

19:22.680 --> 19:24.680
- Colonel Chidozie, on guard.
- [Chidozie] Ma'am.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.480

December 24th... [sighs] ...2004.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.560
You were born on Christmas Eve.

19:43.560 --> 19:45.280
[Ruby inhales deeply] I was abandoned.

19:45.280 --> 19:49.360
My mother must have been so alone.

19:49.880 --> 19:52.440
She left me at the church on Ruby Road.

19:53.160 --> 19:55.520
- And what else?
- It was snowing.

20:04.080 --> 20:06.280
- It's snow.
- That's impossible.

20:06.280 --> 20:08.080
I'll tell you what's impossible.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.200
We haven't turned it on yet.

20:20.400 --> 20:23.720
...that time has tides and hollows.

20:24.240 --> 20:25.360
And secrets.

20:26.800 --> 20:31.520
And this fixed point on Christmas Eve
is the wildest I have ever seen.

20:31.520 --> 20:32.600

- [Morris] Uh, yep. Uh, I'm trying.

21:42.360 --> 21:44.840
This thing is running way beyond maximum.

- No way.

What happened on that night?

22:10.280 --> 22:11.440
The woman.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.280
She went to the church.

22:13.280 --> 22:15.400
She left Ruby in the doorway.

22:16.840 --> 22:18.280
And then she walked away.

22:20.640 --> 22:21.840
Towards us.

[singing continues]

22:24.720 --> 22:25.880

22:40.880 --> 22:42.880
She's my mum. Can she see us?

22:42.880 --> 22:45.200
I don't think she can,
but you can't move. You can't.

22:45.200 --> 22:47.080
You gotta keep everything
exactly as it was,

22:47.080 --> 22:49.240
but she's gonna walk by. Look at her face.

22:49.240 --> 22:51.400
Look. Look, look, look. Here she comes.

22:51.400 --> 22:53.600
- No!
- Ruby, please. Ruby, please. Morris!

22:53.600 --> 22:55.520
- [system voice] <i>Chronon surge.</i>
- Morris, what is happening?

22:55.520 --> 22:57.520
- Power vents flooding like crazy.
- <i>Chronon surge.</i>

22:57.520 --> 23:00.080
- I want to see her!
- [Rose] Ruby, don't move.

23:00.080 --> 23:02.120
We need to keep the image fixed.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.920
Did anyone see her face?

23:04.920 --> 23:06.400
- No. Nothing.
- Nothing. Sorry.

23:08.080 --> 23:09.240
Colonel Chidozie?

23:09.800 --> 23:12.400
Can't make her out. Sorry, Doctor.

23:13.000 --> 23:14.000
Why?

23:15.240 --> 23:16.800
What is so different about her?

23:19.160 --> 23:20.160
[sighs]

23:22.000 --> 23:25.080
[TARDIS thuds, warbles]

23:29.360 --> 23:31.160
I am arriving.

23:37.640 --> 23:38.680
That's me.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.400
The original me.

23:40.400 --> 23:44.160
Coming back in time
in 2004 because goblins.

23:45.400 --> 23:48.840
But I had to go back to the church
to save little baby Ruby.

23:51.040 --> 23:52.760
That TARDIS is almost solid.

23:54.920 --> 24:00.600
If time is memory and memory is time,
then what is the memory of a time machine?

24:01.680 --> 24:03.560
Oh, look. Look, look. She's still there.

24:03.560 --> 24:05.080
- [gasps]
- Your mother is still there.

24:05.080 --> 24:07.040
- [Ruby sighs]
- Why has she stopped?

24:07.040 --> 24:09.240
What is she doing? Can you see?
Why did she stop?

24:09.240 --> 24:10.720
Did she see me fighting?

24:11.240 --> 24:12.840
Anyone? Can you see?

24:12.840 --> 24:15.160
Doctor, I think she's crying.

24:15.160 --> 24:17.760
- [crying]
- [Carla] She's given away her child.

24:18.960 --> 24:20.680
She's crying her heart out.

24:21.400 --> 24:23.160
I took her in, darling.

24:24.440 --> 24:26.000
[crying] And she's safe.

24:27.600 --> 24:29.000
And she's wonderful.

24:29.600 --> 24:33.120
I wish I could tell her. I made it, Mum.

24:33.120 --> 24:36.160
You should see what I've done.
I-I travelled the universe.

24:37.120 --> 24:38.480
[crying continues]

24:38.480 --> 24:41.760
And I, uh-- I came back, running.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.080
And that's when I saw the woman.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.440
My memory of this keeps changing, like,

24:53.520 --> 24:55.240
time keeps changing.

25:01.080 --> 25:02.160
She's pointing at ya.

25:04.280 --> 25:06.360
Uh, can she see you?
Did my mother see you?

25:06.360 --> 25:08.240
I don't know why she was pointing at me.

25:08.240 --> 25:09.840
[Chidozie]
There's nothing behind you, Doctor.

25:11.280 --> 25:12.640
Anything? Anyone?

25:13.160 --> 25:14.600
Does she know who you are?

25:16.080 --> 25:18.160
Morris, can-can you magnify the woman?

25:18.160 --> 25:20.520
- [grunts] My hands are on fire here.
- [alarm blaring]

25:22.960 --> 25:26.320
She's pointing at you,
but she's also pointing north-west.

25:26.320 --> 25:27.720
Is there anything there?

25:28.960 --> 25:30.840
Colonel Chidozie,
you will return to your position.

25:30.840 --> 25:32.360
Just see if there's anything there.

25:32.360 --> 25:35.680
- Doctor, you said not to move.
- I know. I know.

25:37.920 --> 25:38.920
But just-- just look.

25:44.880 --> 25:46.360
[Chidozie] Proceeding forward, ma'am.

25:48.480 --> 25:49.680
There's nothing.

25:49.680 --> 25:52.040
There's just the lamp post and--

25:52.040 --> 25:54.280
And all I've got is trees and stuff.

25:54.280 --> 25:56.160
Houses in the distance. Nothing.

26:00.080 --> 26:02.960
Maybe if I try a different angle.

26:03.600 --> 26:04.840
[Kate] Colonel, be careful!

26:12.720 --> 26:14.720
[Chidozie] No. Sorry. No.

26:14.720 --> 26:16.200
- [grunts]
- [exhales sharply]

26:16.200 --> 26:17.600
Not even a flicker.

26:17.600 --> 26:19.720
- I've got nothing, Doctor.
- [Ruby sighs]

26:19.720 --> 26:21.240
Why was she pointing at me?

26:24.120 --> 26:26.440
Doctor! She's walking away.

26:28.200 --> 26:30.480
- No, don't. No, Mum, please don't--
- Ruby, Ruby.

26:30.480 --> 26:32.520
[crying] Please don't--

26:35.800 --> 26:37.440
[crying continues]

26:58.760 --> 27:00.680
And then I just turned away.

27:06.680 --> 27:09.160
- [TARDIS warbles]
- [sobs]

27:09.160 --> 27:11.240
I can't see her. [sniffles]

27:14.640 --> 27:16.360
[sobs] She's gone.

27:16.360 --> 27:18.440
[sniffles, sobs]

27:22.320 --> 27:23.320
[cries]

27:24.360 --> 27:26.480
[Morris] Doctor, can I ask?

27:26.480 --> 27:31.000
- [stammers] Um, Morris, a second, please.
- [Morris] No, I'm sorry. I've got to ask.

27:32.880 --> 27:34.880
What is that?

27:41.480 --> 27:42.920
[growls]

27:43.960 --> 27:46.520
[gasps, sighs]

27:52.120 --> 27:53.200
[Kate] Doctor.

27:53.720 --> 27:55.360
Doctor, what is that thing?

27:56.360 --> 27:58.600
- Where's Colonel Chidozie?
- At arms!

27:58.600 --> 28:00.400
- [Kate] Don't go into the Window.
- No. No! No.

28:00.400 --> 28:01.640
[Kate] Stay where you are!

28:03.760 --> 28:04.800
[Doctor] Chidozie?

28:04.800 --> 28:06.520
Where are you? Are you in there?

28:10.040 --> 28:14.800
Winston, are you in that shape?

28:15.320 --> 28:18.360
Colonel Chidozie, you will report at once.
Can you hear me?

28:18.360 --> 28:20.720
[growls]

28:20.720 --> 28:21.800
[Kate] Can you hear me?

28:22.720 --> 28:26.760
[breathes shakily, stammers]
Doctor, when is that thing?

28:26.760 --> 28:29.680
Is-Is it now or is it 2004?

28:29.680 --> 28:31.280
- I don't know.
- What is it though?

28:31.280 --> 28:32.960
- Has it come for my mother?
- I don't know.

28:32.960 --> 28:35.400
- Is it us? Has it come for us?
- [stammers] I don't know.

28:35.400 --> 28:36.640
[growls]

28:36.640 --> 28:38.880
[Kate] Colonel Chidozie, please report.

28:38.880 --> 28:41.680
[breathes shakily] Morris,
can you get any readings?

28:41.680 --> 28:43.360
[breathes shakily]

28:43.360 --> 28:44.240
[system voice] <i>Warning.</i>

28:44.240 --> 28:45.520
- <i>Chronon escalation.</i>
- It's off the scale.

28:45.520 --> 28:47.440
- That thing is hot. It's cold.
- <i>Warning.</i>

28:47.440 --> 28:50.160
It's radioactive. It's dead.
It's everything. I don't know.

28:52.480 --> 28:53.640
[Carla] I know its name.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.440
It's the Beast.

28:55.440 --> 28:57.400
[growls]

28:57.400 --> 28:58.480
Winston.

28:59.240 --> 29:01.760
Winston, where are you?
Are you still in this room?

29:03.960 --> 29:05.920
Colonel Chidozie, please report.

29:05.920 --> 29:07.560
Where are you, Cheetham Hill?

29:07.560 --> 29:09.800
[growls]

29:09.800 --> 29:12.360
- [Chidozie] <i>Cheetham Hill.</i>
- That-That-- That's him.

29:12.360 --> 29:13.520
He's alive.

29:14.400 --> 29:17.120
[stammers] Hey, soldier.
I'm still here. Tameside girl.

29:17.760 --> 29:18.960
We're trying to see--

29:19.520 --> 29:21.200
Are you inside that thing?

29:21.200 --> 29:22.520
[Chidozie] <i>No.</i>

29:23.160 --> 29:25.240
Then where are ya?

29:25.920 --> 29:27.120
[Chidozie] <i>I am lost.</i>

29:27.120 --> 29:29.760
Okay, but we can find you. We can help.

29:30.280 --> 29:34.160
Just look around and tell us.
Where are ya?

29:34.760 --> 29:36.040
[Chidozie] <i>I am in hell.</i>

29:37.240 --> 29:38.680
[Kate] Colonel, I need to know.

29:38.680 --> 29:40.880
Can you tell us what's happening?

29:40.880 --> 29:42.240
[Chidozie] <i>It's seen me.</i>

29:42.960 --> 29:45.160
<i>It's seen right into my soul.</i>

29:45.760 --> 29:47.240
<i>And it's so old.</i>

29:47.240 --> 29:48.400
What is it?

29:48.400 --> 29:50.520
- [Chidozie] <i>Waiting.</i>
- [Doctor] What is?

29:51.040 --> 29:53.360
[Chidozie] <i>It's been waiting for so long.</i>

29:55.000 --> 29:56.600
[grunts, shrieks]

29:58.000 --> 29:59.000
[Doctor screams]

30:01.120 --> 30:03.200
[screaming, panting]

30:03.200 --> 30:07.360
- [Window hums, powers down]
- [both panting]

30:19.200 --> 30:20.200
Open the doors.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.680
[doors open]

30:25.600 --> 30:27.600
Keep back. Everyone, keep back.

30:39.920 --> 30:42.600
[Kate] He looks like he's been dead
for a hundred years.

30:43.120 --> 30:44.440
I'm so sorry.

30:59.120 --> 31:00.640
- [comm beeps]
- This is the commander-in-chief

31:00.640 --> 31:02.160
to the Executive Deletion Team.

31:02.160 --> 31:05.720
We have an officer down.
Colonel Winston Lemuel Chidozie.

31:05.720 --> 31:08.160
Floor 45. I want Psych Ops informed.

31:08.160 --> 31:09.840
I want UNIT forensics.

31:10.360 --> 31:13.240
I want full Option 10 and 11 Schematics.

31:13.240 --> 31:14.880
- Immediately.
- [officer] <i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

31:19.800 --> 31:20.880
Mel.

31:21.640 --> 31:22.640
[sighs]

31:25.760 --> 31:27.560
Take me to Susan Triad.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.200
She's due to make the speech
at three o'clock.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.480
We've got ten minutes.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.800
I'm with the media team. Thanks.

31:49.440 --> 31:51.440
[grunts, pants]

32:06.240 --> 32:07.520
I sent him forward.

32:08.120 --> 32:09.400
That thing killed him.

32:10.440 --> 32:12.200
- Not you.
- What was it?

32:13.640 --> 32:15.680
And Ruby's mother,
why was she pointing at me?

32:18.440 --> 32:19.600
Finished?

32:20.800 --> 32:24.200
Now stop grizzling and fix it.

32:24.200 --> 32:28.840
'Cause if Susan is your granddaughter,
then she might be the key to this.

32:30.840 --> 32:31.840
Now come on.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.400
[chuckles]

32:36.280 --> 32:37.280
[sighs]

32:41.240 --> 32:42.280
[computer beeps]

32:42.960 --> 32:44.680
Doctor, we've isolated an image.

32:44.680 --> 32:47.240
Whatever that thing was,
it burnt itself out of the Time Window.

32:47.240 --> 32:49.160
<i>But it survived on the VHS.</i>

32:49.160 --> 32:50.880
[Ruby] <i>That wasn't there before.
I swear to ya.</i>

32:50.880 --> 32:53.120
Every time I've watched that tape,
it wasn't there.

32:53.960 --> 32:56.400
- The recording has changed.
- [Doctor] <i>Kate, analyse it.</i>

32:56.400 --> 32:58.080
Break it down. Every single pixel.

32:58.080 --> 33:00.280
We need to know what that thing is.
I need to see.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.520
I've got image control.

33:02.520 --> 33:04.520
All desks link to mine.

33:05.040 --> 33:08.400
- Coordinating now.
- [computer beeping]

33:14.800 --> 33:15.920
What do you think?

33:17.200 --> 33:19.800
It's a crude videotape of a snowstorm.

33:19.800 --> 33:23.160
Nineteen years old.
Kept under the bed in a shoebox.

33:24.480 --> 33:25.880
I was born for this.

33:28.080 --> 33:30.800
Susan, could I introduce my friend?

33:30.800 --> 33:33.720
- Not right now. We're about to go on.
- Hello. Hi there.

33:34.960 --> 33:37.360
- I'm the Doctor.
- Ah, nice to meet you, pet.

33:37.360 --> 33:39.680
- Doctor who?
- Just the Doctor. Hello. [chuckles]

33:39.680 --> 33:41.760
[chuckles] Well, top marks for enigmatic.

33:41.760 --> 33:44.200
[laughs] Yeah. Yeah.

33:45.320 --> 33:46.720
Have we met before?

33:46.720 --> 33:48.200
- Well, I don't think so.
- Are you sure?

33:48.200 --> 33:51.760
Well, if you don't mind my saying,
I'd remember a handsome chap like you.

33:51.760 --> 33:54.280
It's just that I thought you were...

33:55.400 --> 33:59.000
- We're on in 60 seconds.
- But, Susan, I need to talk to you.

33:59.000 --> 34:01.320
- Just for a couple of minutes.
- If you could tell your friend.

34:01.320 --> 34:03.600
[chuckles] Look,
a lot of people want my time.

34:03.600 --> 34:05.680
All I want is a bit of shut-eye.

34:06.200 --> 34:08.520
- God knows I don't get enough sleep.
- Why not?

34:10.920 --> 34:13.360
I get a lot of dreams.

34:14.560 --> 34:15.560
What do you dream about?

34:15.560 --> 34:17.400
[aide] I'm sorry,
but we're going to be late, Susan.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.080
Saleed, these two no further.

34:19.080 --> 34:21.480
Dreams about what? What sorts of dreams?

34:22.280 --> 34:23.920
Susan, what do you dream about?

34:24.440 --> 34:26.840
Su-- Do you dream about
a girl called Lindy?

34:27.960 --> 34:30.280
Do you dream about
a place called Pacifico del Rio?

34:31.400 --> 34:34.280
Do you dream about being an ambulance?

34:37.440 --> 34:39.000
Sorry, I've really got to go.

34:41.880 --> 34:43.880
- Being an ambulance?
- She remembered them.

34:45.200 --> 34:48.240
She doesn't know how,
but she remembered them.

34:50.400 --> 34:52.880
[computer beeping]

34:53.920 --> 34:55.600
Increase search parameters.

34:55.600 --> 34:58.360
Morris, try running it backwards.

34:58.360 --> 35:02.520
Let's see what happens
if we reverse time and rewind the VHS.

35:02.520 --> 35:05.160
[VHS player whirring]

35:05.160 --> 35:07.240
- The hell?
- Oh, my God.

35:09.360 --> 35:10.480
Doctor, are you there?

35:10.480 --> 35:11.640
Uh-huh.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.720
[Kate] <i>We found something
at the heart of that shape.</i>

35:13.720 --> 35:14.880
What is it?

35:14.880 --> 35:16.600
[Kate] It's the TARDIS.

35:17.800 --> 35:20.440
No, but the TARDIS was there on Ruby Road.
We know that.

35:20.440 --> 35:23.920
[Kate] <i>It's there for a second time.
Which you said couldn't happen.</i>

35:23.920 --> 35:26.040
<i>But this time,
it's 20 metres to the north,</i>

35:26.040 --> 35:27.960
and that thing is wrapped around it.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.080
But how?

35:30.560 --> 35:31.560
I don't know.

35:32.160 --> 35:34.160
[TARDIS groaning]

35:47.120 --> 35:48.320
Doctor, what was that?

35:49.000 --> 35:50.280
It's made that noise before.

35:51.720 --> 35:54.640
[swallows, gasps] Probability of a trap,

35:54.640 --> 35:56.600
99% and rising.

35:56.600 --> 35:59.320
Except the trap is here.

36:01.880 --> 36:05.240
I hate to say this, but the shape exists
around the TARDIS on the VHS.

36:05.240 --> 36:08.280
But what if it exists
around the TARDIS now,

36:08.880 --> 36:10.520
and we just can't see it?

36:11.560 --> 36:12.880
[Doctor] <i>Kate, clear the area.</i>

36:12.880 --> 36:16.200
Evacuate the ops room.
Leave the TARDIS alone.

36:17.960 --> 36:19.560
[groans, inhales sharply]

36:20.800 --> 36:23.160
O-Okay, I've-I've gotta stay here.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.360
I think Susan Triad is a part of it.

36:27.520 --> 36:28.640
[applause]

36:28.640 --> 36:31.200
["Roam" playing on speakers]

36:33.600 --> 36:34.680
Cue laughter.

36:34.680 --> 36:36.760
[laughter]

36:45.640 --> 36:49.600
On my orders, all non-essential staff
will clear the room right now.

36:49.600 --> 36:51.320
[Ibrahim] All non-essential staff, out!

36:53.800 --> 36:54.800
Ruby! Ruby.

36:55.760 --> 36:56.800
I'm sorry. You're part of this.

36:56.800 --> 36:59.240
I need you to stay,
but your mother will be taken home.

36:59.240 --> 37:01.440
- I'm staying with her.
- [sighs] Get her out.

37:01.440 --> 37:03.480
- Mum, what do you want me to do?
- Come home with me.

37:03.480 --> 37:04.800
Then you're not helping.

37:04.800 --> 37:08.040
[inhales sharply] Which means I love you,
thank you and goodbye.

37:10.080 --> 37:11.160
[officer] This way, ma'am.

37:11.680 --> 37:13.440
The Vlinx, scan the TARDIS.

37:13.440 --> 37:15.720
Commence maximum scan.

37:19.480 --> 37:21.480
[scanners humming]

37:27.000 --> 37:29.000
[console beeping]

37:31.440 --> 37:34.120
Analysis confirms life-form.

37:34.120 --> 37:37.800
But we can't see it,
but it registers on the quantum search.

37:39.040 --> 37:40.600
[audience chanting] Susan. Susan.

37:40.600 --> 37:43.560
- Susan. Susan. Susan.
- All right, all right. Thank you!

37:43.560 --> 37:45.600
Thank you! We've had our fun.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.920
- Especially you. Whoo!
- [audience laughs]

37:47.920 --> 37:51.440
But it's my honour to be here today.

37:51.440 --> 37:53.040
And my duty.

37:53.040 --> 37:54.280
[machine humming]

37:54.280 --> 37:56.680
[Susan on monitor]
<i>Because we know what we've done.</i>

37:56.680 --> 37:58.600
<i>The tech billionaires.</i>

37:58.600 --> 38:00.040
<i>We've taken your money...</i>

38:00.040 --> 38:03.760
- [TARDIS groans]
- <i>...while our technology spreads lies,</i>

38:03.760 --> 38:06.040
fraud and riots.

38:07.000 --> 38:08.000
But no more.

38:08.560 --> 38:09.920
It ends today.

38:09.920 --> 38:14.040
Doctor, to confirm,
the TARDIS is-- It's surrounded.

38:14.040 --> 38:17.760
- <i>It's invisible, but it's a living thing.</i>
- ...the hands of the human race. To rebuild.

38:18.440 --> 38:21.800
- And I think--
- [creature] <i>I think we can succeed.</i>

38:21.800 --> 38:22.960
Uh, I mean, I hope--

38:22.960 --> 38:24.880
Doctor, we need you here right now.

38:24.880 --> 38:26.280
- Yes, I know, but--
- [Susan] Sorry.

38:26.280 --> 38:27.720
- Doctor.
- I know. Wait, wait, wait.

38:27.720 --> 38:30.320
- [Susan] Been a hell of a day.
- Kate, get Ruby to the Time Window.

38:30.320 --> 38:32.320
- What for?
- You do not question.

38:32.320 --> 38:33.440
You move.

38:33.440 --> 38:35.080
- Sullivan, take her. And run.
- Just go.

38:35.080 --> 38:36.280
[creature] <i>I hope...</i>

38:38.160 --> 38:41.160
I hope. I dare to hope.

38:43.240 --> 38:48.200
Uh. I said to-- to that man.

38:49.640 --> 38:50.640
Who was he?

38:52.400 --> 38:55.760
But I keep having bad dreams.
[breathes shakily]

38:55.760 --> 38:57.640
[Kate] <i>Doctor, the scan says
this life-form is woven</i>

38:57.640 --> 39:00.160
- <i>into the fabric of the TARDIS itself...</i>
- All my ideas come to me in dreams.

39:00.160 --> 39:01.240
<i>...like it's part of it.</i>

39:01.240 --> 39:02.840
At arms. With me.

39:05.160 --> 39:06.720
My name is Kate Lethbridge-Stewart,

39:06.720 --> 39:09.840
commander-in-chief
of the Unified Intelligence Taskforce,

39:09.840 --> 39:12.800
and I demand that you show yourself.

39:12.800 --> 39:15.280
He has hidden in the howling void.

39:15.280 --> 39:17.720
- He has hidden within the tempest.
- What?

39:17.720 --> 39:21.000
He has braved the storm
and the darkness and the pain.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.440
And he whispered to the vessel.

39:23.040 --> 39:25.000
Who has? Who do you mean?

39:25.000 --> 39:28.040
All this time,
he whispered and delighted and seduced,

39:28.040 --> 39:29.600
and the vessel did obey,

39:29.600 --> 39:32.640
for none shall be more mighty
and none shall be more wise

39:32.640 --> 39:34.680
- than the king himself.
- Harriet, what are you doing?

39:34.680 --> 39:38.560
And the Lord of Time
was blind and vain and knew nothing.

39:38.560 --> 39:41.720
- What is happening in there?
- It's Harriet. It's like...

39:42.720 --> 39:43.720
She's possessed.

39:43.720 --> 39:45.600
Kate, who is she?

39:45.600 --> 39:48.800
- [Kate] <i>Harriet. You met her.</i>
- Yeah, I know. But what is her full name?

39:48.800 --> 39:50.480
Harriet. Harriet Arbinger.

39:54.040 --> 39:55.040
Harbinger.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.440
The gods bring harbingers
to warn us of their coming.

40:01.000 --> 40:02.160
But which god?

40:02.160 --> 40:05.600
I dream of blue skin.

40:05.600 --> 40:07.120
<i>I dream of metal eyes.</i>

40:08.840 --> 40:09.720
[whimpers]

40:18.480 --> 40:20.880
I don't know what he wanted me to do.
Why am I here?

40:20.880 --> 40:21.960
[Window powering up]

40:22.800 --> 40:24.560
[system voice] <i>Time Window closing.</i>

40:26.200 --> 40:29.120
- They said this thing was broken.
- It's starting to remember.

40:30.200 --> 40:32.000
It's going back to Christmas Eve. [pants]

40:32.000 --> 40:35.120
I dream of worlds with orange skies.

40:35.120 --> 40:37.600
[Ibrahim]
You will step away from your desk.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.760
[Kate] Colonel, back away. Stand with me.

40:40.320 --> 40:42.560
I'm not losing another officer.

40:42.560 --> 40:44.640
And in-- in every dream, I'm there.

40:44.640 --> 40:46.960
- [Kate] <i>We know TARDIS is indestructible.</i>
- Doctor.

40:46.960 --> 40:49.120
- <i>If it's hostile, how do we fight it?</i>
- There's something wrong.

40:49.120 --> 40:50.720
But who am I?

40:51.800 --> 40:54.560
There is the Toymaker, the god of games.

40:54.560 --> 40:57.440
<i>There is Trickster, the god of traps.</i>

40:58.520 --> 41:00.520
[distorted]
<i>There is Maestro, the god of music.</i>

41:00.520 --> 41:02.760
- <i>There is Reprobate, the god of spite.</i>
- [screaming]

41:02.760 --> 41:05.880
- No! Get away from her! Don't touch her!
- <i>There is the Mara, the god of beasts.</i>

41:05.880 --> 41:11.520
And the threefold deity
of malice and mischief and misery.

41:12.040 --> 41:14.280
Warning. Manifestation.

41:14.280 --> 41:18.360
[Harriet] There are gods of skin
and shame and secrets.

41:18.360 --> 41:20.600
- There is Incensor...
- Doctor, she needs you!

41:20.600 --> 41:25.680
[Harriet] ...the god of disaster,
and her children called Doubt and Dread.

41:25.680 --> 41:31.680
And standing on high is the mother
and father and other of them all.

41:32.280 --> 41:35.720
Whatever it is, here it comes.

41:35.720 --> 41:38.640
For the god of all gods has returned.

41:39.600 --> 41:41.320
<i>And his names are many.</i>

41:42.000 --> 41:47.160
<i>His name has been Set,
and Seth, and Setekh.</i>

41:47.720 --> 41:51.800
And his one true name forevermore is...

41:56.200 --> 41:57.360
Sutekh.

41:57.360 --> 41:58.440
[pants]

42:00.800 --> 42:02.280
It was the wrong anagram.

42:04.720 --> 42:06.720
[creature growling]

42:17.040 --> 42:19.680
Probable trap. 100%.

42:20.200 --> 42:22.520
[Doctor] Mel, get away from her.
Both of you.

42:22.520 --> 42:23.720
Don't let her touch you.

42:23.720 --> 42:26.720
Bailey, get back. Leave her alone.

42:27.720 --> 42:29.080
You said you were a doctor.

42:29.600 --> 42:32.000
- Why don't you try to help?
- [growls]

42:32.000 --> 42:34.800
Sutekh is the god of death,
and by his hand,

42:34.800 --> 42:38.120
all creation shall fall
into dust and ashes and ruin.

42:38.120 --> 42:39.440
- [growls]
- [people gasp]

42:39.440 --> 42:41.080
[gasps, breathes heavily]

42:43.880 --> 42:45.440
[laughing]

42:53.760 --> 42:58.360
[distorted]
I bring Sutekh's gift of death.

42:59.320 --> 43:02.080
Tell all humanity...

43:02.080 --> 43:03.800
[Sutekh] I am Sutekh.

43:03.800 --> 43:05.920
The god of death.

43:07.000 --> 43:09.000
<i>I am the night.</i>

43:09.800 --> 43:11.960
<i>I am the terror.</i>

43:12.520 --> 43:14.920
<i>I am the loss.</i>

43:15.640 --> 43:18.240
[projection buzzing]

43:19.560 --> 43:20.680
Mum?

43:20.680 --> 43:24.480
[Sutekh] And all life
will perish at my hand.

43:28.560 --> 43:29.800
[Sutekh laughs]

43:31.920 --> 43:35.400
[normal voice]
Did you think I was family, Doctor?

43:40.360 --> 43:45.720
[distorted]
I bring Sutekh's gift of death.

43:46.720 --> 43:47.720
For you.

43:48.760 --> 43:51.200
And for all in your tiny,

43:51.200 --> 43:56.760
vile, incessant universe.

44:01.240 --> 44:03.240
[theme song playing]
