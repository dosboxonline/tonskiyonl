scattered throughout history.

- No, girl, that alien is dead.

We actually don't know
anything about these creatures.

head-on collisions.

Spooner, are you

00:35.078 --> 00:36.471
- It's dead.

00:41.519 --> 00:43.260

- Okay, so every single one
of those aliens

00:46.524 --> 00:48.309

which means we just have

00:48.352 --> 00:50.876
