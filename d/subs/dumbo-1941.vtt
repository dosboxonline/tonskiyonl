01:30.136 --> 01:34.140
Through the snow
and sleet and hail...

01:34.224 --> 01:37.560
through the blizzard,
through the gale...

01:37.644 --> 01:40.814
through the wind
and through the rain...

01:40.897 --> 01:43.817
over mountain, over plain...

01:43.900 --> 01:47.237
through the blinding
lightning flash...

01:47.320 --> 01:50.824
and the mighty thunder crash...

01:50.907 --> 01:55.078
ever faithful, ever true...

01:55.161 --> 01:57.497
nothing stops him.

01:57.580 --> 01:59.666
He'll get through.

02:05.338 --> 02:08.675
Look out for Mr. Stork
that persevering chap

02:08.758 --> 02:12.262
He'll come along and drop
a bundle in your lap

02:12.345 --> 02:15.682
You may be poor or rich
It doesn't matter which

02:15.765 --> 02:19.352
Millionaires, they get theirs
like the butcher and the baker

02:19.436 --> 02:22.981
So look out for Mr. Stork
and let me tell you, friend

02:23.023 --> 02:27.152
Don't try to get away
He'll find you in the end

02:27.193 --> 02:30.363
He'll spot you out in China
or he'll fly to County Cork

02:30.447 --> 02:33.825
So you'd better look out
for Mr. Stork

03:22.248 --> 03:25.919
Look out for Mr. Stork
He's got you on his list

03:26.002 --> 03:29.673
And when he comes around
it's useless to resist

03:29.756 --> 03:33.343
Remember those quintuplets
and the woman in the shoe

03:33.426 --> 03:36.846
Maybe he's got his eye on you

05:23.536 --> 05:25.830
All aboard! All aboard!

05:25.955 --> 05:29.793
All aboard! Let's go!

05:52.399 --> 05:54.985
Casey Junior's comin' down the track

05:55.068 --> 05:58.989
Comin' down the track
with a smoky stack

05:59.072 --> 06:01.825
Hear him puffiin'
comin' round the hill

06:01.908 --> 06:05.745
Casey's here to thrill
every Jack and Jill

06:05.829 --> 06:08.999
Every time his funny
little whistle sounds

06:09.082 --> 06:12.335
Everybody hurries
to the circus grounds

06:12.419 --> 06:15.088
Time for lemonade and Cracker Jack

06:15.171 --> 06:18.508
Casey Junior's back
Casey Junior's back

06:33.523 --> 06:35.859
Oh. My, my.

06:37.444 --> 06:40.363
Now let me see.

06:40.447 --> 06:43.616
Must be right around here somewhere.

06:43.700 --> 06:46.036
I hope.
Ah, watch it there.

06:54.210 --> 06:56.963
On the treetop

07:00.717 --> 07:03.219
Where are we here?
Oh, here.

07:03.303 --> 07:07.974
Highway 61, four miles
to the gas station

07:08.058 --> 07:11.811
Turn left
Da-da da-da-da de

07:12.979 --> 07:15.482
Ah. That must be it.

07:19.069 --> 07:21.821
Well, little fella,
let's get goin'.

07:41.758 --> 07:46.012
Mrs. Jumbo. Oh, Mrs. Jumbo.

07:46.096 --> 07:48.098
Calling Mrs. Jumbo.

07:50.183 --> 07:52.102
Mrs. Jumbo?

07:53.853 --> 07:55.772
Oh. My.

07:58.024 --> 08:00.694
Mrs. Jumbo!

08:04.698 --> 08:08.118
- Oh, where's that Mrs. Jum...
- Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!

08:08.201 --> 08:09.786
- Over here.
- This way, boy.

08:09.869 --> 08:11.621
- In here! In here!
- Yoo-hoo!

08:11.705 --> 08:15.375
- This is the place.
- Whew! At last.

08:15.458 --> 08:18.795
Which one of you ladies
is expecting?

08:18.878 --> 08:21.798
- Hmph! Not me.
- The very idea.

08:21.881 --> 08:24.634
Certainly not.
Over there, of course.

08:24.718 --> 08:26.970
Yes, of course.
Right over there.

08:27.053 --> 08:30.473
Oh. Of course.

08:38.063 --> 08:40.150
Here is a baby with eyes of blue...

08:40.232 --> 08:42.652
straight from heaven
right to you.

08:44.404 --> 08:47.824
Or: Straight from heaven
up above...

08:47.907 --> 08:50.327
here is a baby for you to love.

08:51.995 --> 08:54.497
Sign here, please.

08:57.167 --> 09:00.086
Uh, yeah. Well... Oh. Mrs. Jumbo.

09:03.590 --> 09:07.552
Uh, one moment, please.
This is still part of the service.

09:09.179 --> 09:11.931
Happy Birthday to you

09:12.057 --> 09:15.101
Ah, Happy Birthday to you

09:15.185 --> 09:18.605
Ah, Happy Birthday, dear

09:18.688 --> 09:21.733
Ah, dear
Dear me. What's his name?

09:21.858 --> 09:24.861
Jumbo. Junior.

09:24.944 --> 09:27.614
Oh! Jumbo Junior, huh?
Ahem! Jumbo Junior.

09:28.782 --> 09:32.952
Happy Birthday, dear Jumbo Junior

09:33.036 --> 09:35.288
Happy Birthday

09:36.790 --> 09:43.129
To-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo

09:43.213 --> 09:45.632
You

09:48.718 --> 09:51.554
- Oh, do hurry, dear.
- I'm on pins and needles.

09:51.680 --> 09:53.765
- Isn't it thrilling?
- I'm all a-flutter.

09:53.807 --> 09:57.560
Ah, this is a proud, proud day.

09:57.644 --> 10:00.730
- Well, hurry and open it, dearie.
- I'm just dying to see.

10:03.149 --> 10:06.653
- Oh!
- Look at him!

10:06.695 --> 10:09.322
Look at him!

10:09.406 --> 10:11.616
Oh, what a... Oh, look!

10:11.658 --> 10:15.912
- Oh, you sweet little thing.
- He is cute, isn't he?

10:15.996 --> 10:18.999
Oh, he is a darling little baby.

10:18.999 --> 10:22.752
Adorable. Simply adorable.

10:22.794 --> 10:25.922
Did you ever see
anything so cunning?

10:26.006 --> 10:28.091
Isn't he a darling!

10:28.174 --> 10:32.429
Kootchy, kootchy, kootchy,
kootchy, kootchy, kootchy.

10:41.688 --> 10:43.940
- Oh!
- Oh!

10:44.024 --> 10:47.110
- Is it possible?
- Isn't there some mistake?

10:47.193 --> 10:50.030
Just look at those, those...

10:50.113 --> 10:52.866
E-A-R-S.

10:52.949 --> 10:56.619
Those what? Oh, ears!

10:56.703 --> 11:00.498
These! Aren't they funny? Oh!

11:00.540 --> 11:03.001
- Oh, my goodness.
- What a temper.

11:03.043 --> 11:04.794
Oh, what did I do?
Well, tell me.

11:04.878 --> 11:07.047
- Did I say anything?
- Perfectly harmless remark.

11:07.130 --> 11:08.798
I just said that they're funny,
and they are funny.

11:08.882 --> 11:11.051
- They certainly are.
- After all, who cares...

11:11.134 --> 11:13.470
about her precious little Jumbo?

11:13.553 --> 11:17.140
Jumbo? You mean Dumbo.

11:17.223 --> 11:19.309
Dumbo.

11:21.186 --> 11:23.813
- Dumbo, I say.
- That's good.

11:23.855 --> 11:26.983
- Dumbo! That's good.
- Dumbo.

12:11.945 --> 12:15.532
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can. I think I can.

12:15.615 --> 12:20.620
I think I can. I think I can.
I think I can.

12:20.704 --> 12:24.791
I thought I could. I thought I could.
I thought I could. I thought I could.

12:24.874 --> 12:27.877
Whoo-woo!

13:24.267 --> 13:28.188
Hike, ugh, hike, ugh
hike, ugh, hike

13:28.271 --> 13:30.440
We work all day
We work all night

13:30.523 --> 13:32.359
We never learned
to read or write

13:32.442 --> 13:35.862
We're happy-hearted roustabouts

13:37.197 --> 13:40.867
Hike, ugh, hike, ugh
hike, ugh, hike

13:40.950 --> 13:43.453
When other folks have gone to bed

13:43.536 --> 13:45.538
We slave until we're almost dead

13:45.538 --> 13:48.875
We're happy-hearted roustabouts

13:50.210 --> 13:54.214
Hike, ugh, hike, ugh
hike, ugh, hike

13:54.297 --> 13:56.466
We don't know when
we get our pay

13:56.549 --> 13:59.302
And when we do
we throw our pay away

13:59.386 --> 14:02.973
When we get our pay
we throw our money all away

14:03.056 --> 14:05.141
We get our pay when children say

14:05.225 --> 14:07.894
With happy hearts
It's circus day today

14:07.978 --> 14:11.815
Then we get our pay
just watching kids on circus day

14:11.898 --> 14:15.986
Muscles aching
Back near breaking

14:16.069 --> 14:19.656
Eggs and bacon's what we need

14:19.739 --> 14:22.659
- Yes, sir!
- Boss man houndin'

14:22.742 --> 14:24.828
Keep on poundin'

14:24.911 --> 14:28.748
For your bread and keep

14:28.832 --> 14:31.167
There ain't no letup

14:31.251 --> 14:33.336
Got to set up

14:33.420 --> 14:35.505
Pull that canvas

14:35.588 --> 14:37.757
Drive that stake

14:37.841 --> 14:42.012
Want to doze off
Get them clothes off

14:42.095 --> 14:46.516
But must keep awake

14:46.599 --> 14:50.603
Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave!
Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave!

14:50.687 --> 14:55.191
Hep! Heave! Hep! Heave!
Hep! Heave! Hep!

14:55.275 --> 14:57.360
Swing that sledge
Sing that song

14:57.444 --> 14:59.362
Work and laugh
the whole night long

14:59.446 --> 15:02.532
You happy-hearted roustabouts

15:03.783 --> 15:06.119
Pullin: poundin'
tyin: groundin'

15:06.202 --> 15:08.204
Big top roundin' into shape

15:08.288 --> 15:10.206
Keep on workin'
Stop that shirkin'

15:10.290 --> 15:12.625
Grab that rope, you hairy ape

15:12.709 --> 15:16.880
Poundin: poundin'

15:16.963 --> 15:20.884
Oh

18:32.534 --> 18:34.494
Jostling and juggling.
Fifteen minutes!

18:34.494 --> 18:36.663
Step right up and get your tickets.
Hurry, hurry now.

18:36.746 --> 18:39.833
Hurry to the big sideshow.
That's why you go under the big top.

18:39.958 --> 18:43.753
Fifteen big attractions that you
can't see anywhere else in the world!

18:43.837 --> 18:46.256
The greatest collection
in the entire world.

18:46.339 --> 18:50.885
And the greatest comedies are featured
and assembled for your entertainment.

18:51.011 --> 18:54.931
Ain't that the funniest thing
you ever saw? Look at his ears.

18:58.268 --> 19:00.937
Hey, guys, look it!
Smitty's an elephant!

19:04.316 --> 19:06.151
- Aw, let me see!
- Boo!

19:06.276 --> 19:08.945
- You can't hide him from us.
- Yeah, his ears are still stickin' out.

19:09.029 --> 19:10.572
- Come on!
- We wanna see him!

19:10.697 --> 19:13.616
- We wanna laugh.
- Sure, that's what we came for.

19:18.371 --> 19:21.666
Hey, the biggest slingshot
in the world.

19:21.708 --> 19:23.877
- Hey! Cut that out!
- Hey, let's get out of here.

19:23.960 --> 19:27.797
- You're hurting me! Help!
- Here, you! What's going on?

19:29.966 --> 19:32.093
Down. Mrs. Jumbo, down!

19:32.135 --> 19:34.971
Surround her. Tie her down.

19:53.990 --> 19:56.326
Get down!

19:56.409 --> 19:59.329
Calm down! Tie her down!

20:33.530 --> 20:35.615
Darling, it was so funny.

20:35.699 --> 20:37.951
Oh, my dear, can you bear it?

20:38.034 --> 20:41.871
When she doused the ringmaster,
I just thought I'd die.

20:41.955 --> 20:44.708
Well, personally, I think
she went a bit too far.

20:44.791 --> 20:47.210
After all, one mustn't forget
one is a lady.

20:47.294 --> 20:49.004
- Oh, you're right, dear. Yes.
- Oh, that's very true.

20:49.045 --> 20:51.464
Oh, well, I suppose
that's mother love.

20:51.548 --> 20:53.883
But it's certainly no excuse
for what she did.

20:53.925 --> 20:56.970
Mother love might cover
a multitude of sins.

20:57.053 --> 20:59.472
It's true, my dear,
and she has such a streak in...

20:59.556 --> 21:01.558
A guy can't eat in peace.

21:01.641 --> 21:03.643
Yes, but mother love does...

21:03.727 --> 21:05.937
Gab, gab, gab.
Always gossipin'.

21:05.979 --> 21:09.399
Girls, girls! Listen!

21:09.482 --> 21:11.943
Have I got a trunk full of dirt.

21:11.985 --> 21:14.904
- Well, darling, tell us all.
- Go on, go on.

21:14.988 --> 21:19.576
Well, I heard today that they have
put her in solitary confinement.

21:19.617 --> 21:21.661
- No!
- You don't mean it!

21:21.745 --> 21:24.247
Oh, how awful for her!

21:24.331 --> 21:27.167
Well, I-I must say,
I-I don't blame her for anything.

21:27.250 --> 21:31.004
You're absolutely right.
It's all the fault of that little...

21:31.087 --> 21:34.174
F-R-E-A-K.

21:34.215 --> 21:38.678
Yes, him with those ears
that only a mother could love.

21:40.013 --> 21:41.931
What's the matter with his ears?

21:42.015 --> 21:45.101
I don't see nothin' wrong with 'em.
I think they're cute.

21:46.353 --> 21:49.856
Ladies, ladies!
It's no laughing matter at all.

21:49.939 --> 21:52.192
Oh. Oh, she's right, girls.

21:52.275 --> 21:56.780
Don't forget that we elephants
have always walked with dignity.

21:56.863 --> 21:59.240
His disgrace is our own shame.

21:59.366 --> 22:01.284
- Yes, that's true. That's very true.
- Oh, indeed it is.

22:01.368 --> 22:06.122
Well, frankly, I wouldn't eat
at the same bale of hay with him.

22:06.206 --> 22:07.540
- No. Right.
- Me either, dearie.

22:07.582 --> 22:10.335
-I should say.
-Nor I. That's just how I feel about it.

22:10.377 --> 22:12.796
Here he comes now.

22:12.879 --> 22:16.633
Hmm. Pretend you don't see him.

22:16.716 --> 22:19.219
Shh.

22:22.389 --> 22:26.142
How do ya like that?
Givin' him the cold shoulder.

22:27.560 --> 22:30.480
Poor little guy.

22:30.563 --> 22:34.901
There he goes,
without a friend in the world.

22:36.778 --> 22:38.822
Nobody to turn to.

22:40.657 --> 22:43.994
Oh, I'll do somethin' about this.

22:49.082 --> 22:51.001
A mouse!

22:56.172 --> 22:58.174
So ya like to pick
on little guys, huh?

22:58.258 --> 23:00.927
Well, why don't you pick on me?

23:07.517 --> 23:09.769
A proud race.

23:09.853 --> 23:12.105
Overstuffed hay bags!

23:23.366 --> 23:25.869
Boo!

23:25.952 --> 23:28.538
Still afraid of a mouse.

23:28.621 --> 23:31.875
Ho-ho, boy.
Wait'll I tell the little guy.

23:31.958 --> 23:34.711
Where is he? Oh. Hey, Dumbo.

23:34.794 --> 23:37.464
You can come out now.

23:37.547 --> 23:40.967
Golly. Maybe I scared him too.

23:41.051 --> 23:43.219
Look, Dumbo. I'm your friend.

23:43.303 --> 23:45.305
Come on out, won't ya?

23:47.140 --> 23:50.393
You're not really afraid
of little me, are ya?

23:52.062 --> 23:54.397
Ya are?
Must've overdid it in there.

23:54.481 --> 23:57.233
Don't know my own strength sometimes.

23:59.569 --> 24:02.238
Dumbo. Look what I got for ya.

24:06.326 --> 24:09.412
Uh-uh-uh-uh.
Ya gotta come out first.

24:15.502 --> 24:17.837
Too bad ya don't trust me,
'cause I thought...

24:17.921 --> 24:22.759
uh, well, you... you and me, uh, we
might get your mother out of the clink.

24:22.842 --> 24:25.762
Oh, but I guess you wouldn't
be interested. So long, Dumbo.

24:31.935 --> 24:34.437
Well, that's more like it.

24:34.521 --> 24:37.107
Ya know, your ma ain't crazy.

24:37.190 --> 24:39.609
She's just brokenhearted.

24:39.693 --> 24:43.530
It ain't nobody's fault
you got them big ears.

24:43.613 --> 24:46.866
Uh-oh. Boy, I stepped in it that time.

24:46.950 --> 24:51.955
Aw, gee, Dumbo.
I think your ears are beautiful.

24:52.038 --> 24:55.959
Sure. As a matter of fact,
I think they're very decorative.

24:56.042 --> 24:59.963
You know, lots of people
with big ears are famous.

25:00.046 --> 25:03.300
Ho-ho, boy.
All we gotta do is build an act.

25:03.383 --> 25:06.469
Make ya a star. A headliner!

25:06.553 --> 25:08.805
Dumbo the Great!

25:11.891 --> 25:14.644
Uh-oh. The great what?

25:16.479 --> 25:20.650
Ya know, Dumbo,
we gotta get an idea.

25:20.734 --> 25:24.654
Not just any idea.
Something colossal, like, uh...

25:24.738 --> 25:28.491
Have I got an idea!
What an idea!

25:28.575 --> 25:30.827
Huh. He never had an idea
in his life.

25:30.910 --> 25:35.248
Just visualize:
One elephant climbs up...

25:35.332 --> 25:38.585
on top of another elephant
until finally...

25:38.668 --> 25:40.920
all 17 elephants...

25:41.004 --> 25:44.424
have constructed
an enormous pyramid...

25:44.507 --> 25:46.593
of pachyderms.

25:46.676 --> 25:49.179
I step out.

25:49.262 --> 25:51.181
I blow the whistle.

25:51.264 --> 25:53.683
- Yeah.
- The trumpets are trumpeting.

25:53.767 --> 25:55.602
- Yeah.
- And now...

25:55.685 --> 25:58.021
comes the climax!

25:59.522 --> 26:02.025
Yeah? What is the climax?

26:02.108 --> 26:04.527
Hmm. I don't know.

26:04.611 --> 26:06.946
I knew he never had nothin'.

26:07.030 --> 26:09.949
Well, maybe it comes to me...

26:10.033 --> 26:13.703
in a vision while I dream.

26:13.787 --> 26:16.206
- Good night, Joe.
- Good night, Boss.

26:16.289 --> 26:18.208
Climax.

26:19.626 --> 26:23.463
Climax! Dumbo, you're a climax.

26:24.965 --> 26:27.884
I'll be back in a minute.
I'm gonna take care of your future.

27:24.190 --> 27:28.445
I am the voice
of your subconscious mind.

27:29.529 --> 27:32.115
Your inspiration.

27:32.198 --> 27:34.701
Now, concentrate.

27:37.787 --> 27:39.456
Remember?
Your pyramid of elephants...

27:39.539 --> 27:41.708
are standing in the ring
waitin' for a climax.

27:41.791 --> 27:45.629
- Climax.
- You are now getting that climax.

27:45.712 --> 27:47.714
- Climax.
- How's the reception?

27:47.797 --> 27:50.967
Comin' through okay? Good.

27:51.051 --> 27:53.553
Suddenly, from the sidelines,
comes your climax.

27:53.637 --> 27:55.972
- Climax.
- Gallopin' across the arena.

27:56.056 --> 27:58.475
- Arena.
- He jumps from a springboard...

27:58.558 --> 28:00.060
to a platform.

28:00.143 --> 28:03.396
At the very pinnacle of your pyramid,
he waves a flag...

28:03.480 --> 28:05.148
for a glorious finish!

28:05.231 --> 28:09.235
- Finish?
- And who is your climax?

28:10.403 --> 28:12.238
The little elephant
with the big ears!

28:12.322 --> 28:17.744
The world's mightiest
midget mastodon! Dumbo!

28:17.827 --> 28:19.746
What?

28:19.829 --> 28:22.332
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

28:22.415 --> 28:24.668
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

28:24.751 --> 28:28.004
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo.

28:28.088 --> 28:30.090
I got it! I got it!

28:31.424 --> 28:34.427
Ladies and gentlemen...

28:34.511 --> 28:37.931
we will now present
for your entertainment...

28:38.014 --> 28:41.351
the most stupendous, magnificent...

28:41.434 --> 28:44.771
super-colossal spectacle.

28:44.854 --> 28:47.190
On this tiny...

28:47.273 --> 28:50.360
little, insignificant ball...

28:50.443 --> 28:52.612
we will construct for you...

28:52.696 --> 28:56.616
a pyramid, not of wood,
not of stone...

28:56.700 --> 28:59.703
To hear him talk,
you'd think he was going to do it.

28:59.786 --> 29:02.622
- but a living, breathing...
- The stuffed shirt.

29:02.706 --> 29:06.710
pyramid of ponderous, pulsating...

29:06.793 --> 29:11.214
pulchritudinous pachyderms!

29:12.549 --> 29:14.634
I give you the elephants.

29:40.076 --> 29:41.995
Aren't we a bit clumsy?

29:50.503 --> 29:53.340
Gaining a little weight,
aren't you, honey?

29:53.423 --> 29:56.760
You're no cream puff
yourself, dearie.

29:56.843 --> 29:59.929
Quiet up there.
Tend to your work, girls.

30:13.693 --> 30:17.697
Take your foot out of my eye,
clumsy ox.

30:23.620 --> 30:25.705
Steady, girls.

30:33.964 --> 30:36.466
Boy, that was a close one.

30:36.549 --> 30:40.053
They're almost ready now, Dumbo.
Don't forget to wave that flag.

30:40.136 --> 30:43.056
Okay, okay.
Don't wave it no more. I saw ya.

30:43.139 --> 30:45.809
Now, look. All ya gotta do
is run out, see?

30:45.892 --> 30:47.894
Jump on the springboard.

30:47.978 --> 30:51.815
All right, now show me
just how you're gonna do it.

30:51.898 --> 30:54.985
That's it. Attaboy.
That's the stuff. Come on.

30:55.068 --> 30:57.487
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! Dumbo!

30:57.570 --> 31:00.156
Oh, those ears.
We gotta do somethin', quick.

31:03.410 --> 31:05.662
Ladies and gentlemen...

31:05.662 --> 31:08.665
you have now seen the impossible...

31:08.748 --> 31:11.167
accomplished in front of your faces.

31:11.251 --> 31:13.920
Seven jungle giants...

31:14.004 --> 31:15.922
each one weighing not...

31:16.006 --> 31:17.590
That windbag!

31:17.674 --> 31:20.510
- Why doesn't he come to the point?
- 7,500 pounds!

31:20.593 --> 31:22.846
And now, I present...

31:22.929 --> 31:26.182
the world's smallest
little elephant...

31:26.266 --> 31:30.270
who will spring
from this springboard...

31:30.353 --> 31:32.439
in one spring...

31:32.522 --> 31:36.526
to the top of this pyramid,
waving his little flag...

31:36.609 --> 31:39.863
for a grand climax!

31:39.946 --> 31:42.449
Ladies and gentlemen...

31:42.532 --> 31:45.785
I give you Dumbo!

31:56.630 --> 31:58.965
Go on! Get goin'!

31:59.049 --> 32:02.302
What's the matter with you?
Dumbo! That's your cue!

32:02.385 --> 32:04.387
You're on, Dumbo.

33:04.948 --> 33:07.617
Out of my way, assassin!

34:12.181 --> 34:14.351
- Dear!
- Ohh.

34:14.434 --> 34:18.688
I never thought I'd live
to see the big top fall.

34:18.688 --> 34:23.360
Because of that Dumbo,
I never can show my face there again.

34:23.443 --> 34:26.696
Oh, look at my beautiful tail!

34:26.780 --> 34:30.367
I'd just like to spank
the daylights out of him...

34:30.449 --> 34:34.371
Ah! Oh! Oh! Ohh.

34:34.454 --> 34:38.625
Oh, that won't be necessary, dearie.

34:38.708 --> 34:41.210
They fixed him good.

34:41.293 --> 34:43.213
- What do you mean?
- Wh-What did they do?

34:43.295 --> 34:44.965
- Did they beat him?
- What is it, darling?

34:45.047 --> 34:47.634
- Tell us.
- Come, come. I demand to know.

34:47.717 --> 34:51.888
Oh. Well, they've gone and made him...

34:51.888 --> 34:54.808
- Oh, dear, I just can't say it.
- Out with it!

34:54.891 --> 34:57.727
Made him a clown.

34:57.811 --> 34:59.729
A clown?

34:59.813 --> 35:02.649
- No!
- Yes.

35:02.732 --> 35:06.403
Oh, the shame of it.

35:06.486 --> 35:08.989
Let us take the solemn vow.

35:11.074 --> 35:14.828
From now on, he is no longer...

35:14.911 --> 35:16.830
an elephant.

35:25.422 --> 35:30.093
Please! Help me save
my poor baby!

35:30.093 --> 35:33.930
Whoo! Save my child!

35:44.274 --> 35:46.276
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Where are you? Yoo-hoo!

35:46.359 --> 35:48.945
Yoo-hoo! Yoo-hoo!

35:49.029 --> 35:51.281
Hey! Hey! Hey!

36:18.224 --> 36:20.226

36:34.574 --> 36:36.910

36:36.993 --> 36:38.995
- Hurry up!
- We'll save you. Go on.

36:39.079 --> 36:41.456
-Jump!
- We'll save ya.

36:58.014 --> 37:00.350
Whew! Boy, oh, boy,

37:00.475 --> 37:02.352
- What a performance!
- Are we good?

37:02.435 --> 37:04.187
Thirteen curtain calls.
Thirteen!

37:04.270 --> 37:06.272
Yeah, sure brought down
the house, all right.

37:06.356 --> 37:09.442
Oh, Mama, did we panic 'em.
Ask me, Joey. Go ahead. Ask me.

37:09.526 --> 37:11.528
You said it.
We rolled 'em in the aisles.

37:11.528 --> 37:13.863
- Boy, oh, boy, what an act.
- Oh, "what an act" is right.

37:13.947 --> 37:15.573
Stupendous, I call it.

37:15.615 --> 37:17.534
They'll have more respect
for us clowns now.

37:17.534 --> 37:19.703
- Yeah, yeah, you bet.
- Here, boys.

37:19.744 --> 37:22.372
This calls for a real celebration.
Come and get it.

37:22.372 --> 37:25.625
- Poison! Am I thirsty.
- I could use one of them myself.

37:25.709 --> 37:27.585
- This one's on Dumbo.
- Yeah, Dumbo.

37:27.711 --> 37:31.047
- Dumbo!
- Here's plaster in his eyes.

37:31.131 --> 37:33.800
See? They're drinkin'
a toast to ya.

37:33.842 --> 37:36.052
Yeah. You're a big hit.

37:40.473 --> 37:42.642
Why, uh, you're terrific.

37:44.769 --> 37:47.397
Oh, you're colossal. Stupendous.

37:48.690 --> 37:52.569
Come on. Alley-oop.
I gotta wash behind your ears.

37:52.610 --> 37:54.696
You ought a be proud.

37:54.821 --> 37:56.990
You're a success.

38:01.911 --> 38:04.414
Look. A peanut!

38:04.497 --> 38:07.334
Come on. Eat it.
Got lots of vitamins.

38:09.669 --> 38:12.422
Give ya a lot of, uh, pep.

38:15.508 --> 38:17.636
Oh-ho-ho.

38:17.761 --> 38:19.679
Why, we're goin' over

38:19.721 --> 38:21.931
I made an appointment for ya.
Didn't I tell ya? Huh!

38:22.057 --> 38:25.185
Just like me. I must have forgot.
Come on. Get your hat.

38:31.441 --> 38:35.028
Oh. Right over there.

38:35.111 --> 38:37.280
Cozy little place, ain't it?

38:44.704 --> 38:48.541
Mrs. Jumbo. I hope she's in.

38:49.626 --> 38:52.545
Someone to see ya.

39:21.574 --> 39:24.619
Baby mine

39:24.661 --> 39:29.165
Don't you cry

39:29.249 --> 39:32.252
Baby mine

39:32.335 --> 39:37.007
Dry your eyes

39:37.090 --> 39:39.676

Close to my heart

39:41.928 --> 39:44.180
Never to part

39:44.264 --> 39:47.017
Baby of mine

39:48.435 --> 39:51.479
Little one

39:51.521 --> 39:55.650
When you play

39:55.775 --> 39:58.778
Don't you mind

39:58.862 --> 40:03.033
What they say

40:03.116 --> 40:05.827
Let those eyes

40:05.952 --> 40:07.787
Sparkle and shine

40:07.912 --> 40:10.290
Never a tear

40:10.373 --> 40:14.794
Baby of mine

40:43.990 --> 40:46.993
From your head

40:47.077 --> 40:48.828
To your toes

40:48.912 --> 40:51.915

41:36.251 --> 41:39.212
Boy, I can't get over the way
we rolled 'em in the aisles.

41:39.296 --> 41:42.465
-Just wait'll we hit the big town.
- This gives me an idea.

41:42.507 --> 41:44.968
Let's raise the platform
the elephant jumps off of.

41:45.051 --> 41:47.637
Yeah! If they laugh
when he jumps 20 feet...

41:47.721 --> 41:50.557
they'll laugh twice as hard
if he jumps 40 feet.

41:50.598 --> 41:53.643
- Yeah, that's right. That's right.
- Simple mathematics.

41:53.727 --> 41:57.314
- Let's make it 80 feet.
- Don't be a piker. 180.

41:57.397 --> 41:59.316
- Make it 300.
- A thousand.

41:59.399 --> 42:02.152
- Yeah, that's good.
- Hey, be careful.

42:02.235 --> 42:04.237
- You'll hurt the little guy.
- Aw, go on.

42:04.321 --> 42:07.157
- Elephants ain't got no feelings.
- No, they're made of rubber.

42:07.282 --> 42:10.076
This idea is sensational.
Let's go tell the boss.

42:10.160 --> 42:11.578
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Come on. Let's go.

42:11.661 --> 42:13.496
Hey, hey!
Let's hit him for a raise.

42:13.538 --> 42:15.832
Yeah, sure.
This is worth real dough.

42:15.874 --> 42:19.544
Oh, we're gonna hit
the big boss for a raise

42:19.586 --> 42:23.173
Yes, we're gonna hit
the big boss for a raise

42:23.256 --> 42:27.177
Oh, we're gonna get more money
'cause we know that we're funny

42:27.260 --> 42:30.472
We're gonna hit
the big boss for a raise

42:35.935 --> 42:39.689
I know how ya feel, Dumbo,
but you gotta pull yourself together.

42:39.773 --> 42:43.777
What would your mother think of ya,
if she saw you crying like this?

42:43.860 --> 42:46.613
Remember, you come of a proud race.

42:48.031 --> 42:50.367
Why you're a-a-a... a pachyderm...

42:50.450 --> 42:52.369
and pachyderms don't cry.

42:52.452 --> 42:55.538
What's cryin' get ya anyhow?
Nothin' but the hiccups.

42:57.791 --> 42:59.709
There. Ya see?

43:03.838 --> 43:08.009
Well, ain't nothin'

43:08.134 --> 43:11.054
Oops-a-daisy. We'll have ya

43:12.138 --> 43:14.015
Come on.

43:18.728 --> 43:20.897
Here. Take a trunk full.

43:22.983 --> 43:24.901
Listen, little fella.

43:24.985 --> 43:27.737

The whole circus is gonna be proud
of ya. Now, what do ya think of that?

43:40.083 --> 43:42.085
Swallow it.

43:42.168 --> 43:44.671
Ho-ho. They can't keep us down.

43:46.923 --> 43:49.342
Oh, I guess you had
one little one left over.

43:49.426 --> 43:52.846
Dumbo, we'll bounce back so ha...

43:52.929 --> 43:55.849
Hey, what's the matter with you?

44:01.730 --> 44:04.691
What kind of water is this, anyhow?

44:57.786 --> 45:00.747
Balloonies.

45:00.830 --> 45:02.832
Hiya, George.

45:23.061 --> 45:25.855
Whee!

45:32.779 --> 45:36.616
That's a pretty
schstrick schlick.

45:36.700 --> 45:41.871
All right. Let's see ya
blow a square one, pal.

45:48.878 --> 45:52.215
Say, that's very, very clever.

45:52.299 --> 45:56.803
Now blow a great big one.

46:18.908 --> 46:20.827
That's a pretty sh... Hey!

46:25.332 --> 46:27.751
Dumbo.

46:27.834 --> 46:30.337
You see what I see?

47:37.821 --> 47:41.825
Look out, look out
Pink elephants on parade

47:41.908 --> 47:44.327
Here they come
Hippity-hoppity

47:44.411 --> 47:48.581
They're here and there
Pink elephants everywhere

47:48.665 --> 47:50.834
Look out, look out

47:50.917 --> 47:53.837
They're walking around the bed
on their head

47:53.837 --> 47:56.840
Clippity-cloppity
Arrayed in braid

47:56.840 --> 47:59.259
Pink elephants on parade

47:59.342 --> 48:01.344
- What'll I do
- What'll I do

48:01.428 --> 48:03.680
What an unusual view

48:03.763 --> 48:07.684
I can stand the sight of worms
and look at microscopic germs

48:07.767 --> 48:12.272
But Technicolor pachyderms
is really too much for me

48:12.355 --> 48:14.274
I am not the type to faint

48:14.357 --> 48:16.359
When things are odd
or things are quaint

48:16.443 --> 48:18.445
But seein' things
you know there ain't

48:18.528 --> 48:21.114
Can certainly give you
an awful fright

48:21.197 --> 48:24.117
What a sight
Chase 'em away, chase 'em away

48:24.200 --> 48:28.038
I'm afraid, need your aid
Pink elephants on parade

48:28.121 --> 48:30.540
- Hey, hey, hey
- Pink elephants

48:31.625 --> 48:33.793
Pink elephants

48:33.877 --> 48:35.795
Pink elephants

51:01.858 --> 51:05.278
- Well, looky here, looky here.
- My, my.

51:05.362 --> 51:07.280
Why, this is most irregular.

51:07.364 --> 51:09.950
Well, I just can't believe my eyes.

51:10.033 --> 51:14.871
- They ain't dead, is they?
- No. Dead people don't snore.

51:14.955 --> 51:17.290
Or do they?

51:18.875 --> 51:20.877
Uh, wh-what's all the ruckus?
Come on.

51:20.961 --> 51:25.131
Step aside, brother.
Uh, what's cookin' 'round here?

51:25.215 --> 51:27.300
What's the good news?
What's fryin', boy?

51:27.384 --> 51:31.304
-Just look down there, brother.
- And prepare yourself for a shock.

51:37.727 --> 51:41.064
- Well, hush my beak!
- Go ahead. Wake 'em up, brother.

51:41.147 --> 51:43.316
Yeah. Find out
what they're doin' up here.

51:43.400 --> 51:45.485
- Yeah.
- And "ax" them what they want.

51:45.568 --> 51:47.904
Okay, boys. Leave it to me.

52:12.095 --> 52:16.182
Ohh! Those pink elephants.

52:16.266 --> 52:19.185
Ho! Pink elephants? Mm-mmm!

52:23.023 --> 52:26.860
What's so funny? What are you boys
doin' down here, anyway?

52:26.943 --> 52:29.112
What are we doin' down here?

52:29.195 --> 52:31.114
Well, hear him talk.

52:31.197 --> 52:34.200
Go on.
Fly up a tree where you belong.

52:36.119 --> 52:38.622
- Say, look here, Brother Rat.
- Brother Rat?

52:38.705 --> 52:41.958
Now listen. I ain't your brother
and I ain't no rat, see?

52:42.042 --> 52:44.794
Uh-huh. And I suppose you...

52:44.794 --> 52:48.632
and no elephant ain't
up in no tree, either.

52:48.715 --> 52:52.302
No! No, me and no tree
ain't up no... Huh?

52:52.385 --> 52:54.471
Tree?

52:57.057 --> 52:59.142
Yo!

53:00.393 --> 53:02.896
Dumbo.

53:02.979 --> 53:05.565
Dumbo. Wake up.

53:05.649 --> 53:08.568
Wake up, Dumbo!

53:08.652 --> 53:12.238
Don't look now,
but I think we're up in a tree.

53:41.434 --> 53:44.104
Aw, don't pay no attention
to them scarecrows.

53:44.187 --> 53:47.357
Come on, Dumbo.
Let's get back to the circus.

53:47.440 --> 53:49.442
So long, boy!

53:57.284 --> 54:00.787
But I wonder how we ever
got up in that tree, anyway.

54:02.872 --> 54:05.375
Now, let's see.

54:05.458 --> 54:08.044
Elephants can't climb trees,
can they?

54:08.128 --> 54:10.630
Nah, nah, that's ridiculous.

54:10.714 --> 54:13.800
Couldn't jump up.
Mm-mm. It's too high.

54:13.883 --> 54:16.469
Hey there, son.
Maybe you all flew up.

54:17.637 --> 54:21.558
Maybe we flew up.
Yeah, maybe we...

54:21.558 --> 54:24.644
That's it! Dumbo! You flew!

54:24.728 --> 54:27.397
Boy, am I stupid.
Why didn't I think of this before?

54:27.397 --> 54:30.817
Your ears. Just look at 'em, Dumbo.
Why, they're perfect wings.

54:30.900 --> 54:35.572
The very things that held ya down
are gonna carry ya up and up and up!

54:35.572 --> 54:37.907
I can see it all now.

54:37.907 --> 54:40.577
Dumbo, the Ninth Wonder
of the Universe!

54:40.577 --> 54:42.829
The world's only flyin' elephant!

54:45.915 --> 54:47.917
Did you ever see an elephant fly?

54:47.917 --> 54:51.588
- Well, I've seen a horsefly.
- Ah, I've seen a dragonfly.

54:51.588 --> 54:53.840
- Hee-hee. I've seen a housefly.
- Yeah!

54:55.508 --> 54:57.677
See, I've seen all that too.

54:57.761 --> 55:01.348
I've seen a peanut stand
and heard a rubber band.

55:01.431 --> 55:04.434
I seen a needle
that winked its eye.

55:04.434 --> 55:07.854
But I be done seen
about ever'thing

55:07.937 --> 55:10.190
When I see a elephant fly

55:10.273 --> 55:14.027
- What'd you say, boy?
- I said when I see a elephant fly

55:14.110 --> 55:17.614
I seen a front porch swing
heard a diamond ring

55:17.697 --> 55:20.450
I seen a polka-dot railroad tie

55:20.533 --> 55:24.287
But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing

55:24.287 --> 55:26.539
When I see a elephant fly

55:26.623 --> 55:29.542
- Da da-da-da
- Da-da-da do-do-dow wow

55:29.626 --> 55:32.462
- Da da-da-da
- Hey, wow

55:32.545 --> 55:35.215
I saw a clotheshorse
He rear up and buck

55:35.298 --> 55:38.551
And they tell me that a man
made a vegetable truck

55:38.635 --> 55:41.638
I didn't see that
I only heard

55:41.638 --> 55:44.307
Just to be sociable
I'll take your word

55:44.391 --> 55:47.644
- I heard a fireside chat
- I saw a baseball bat

55:47.644 --> 55:50.647
And I just laughed
till I thought I'd die

55:50.730 --> 55:54.401
But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing

55:54.484 --> 55:57.570
When I see a elephant fly

55:57.654 --> 56:01.074
Bo Sho Ba-da-do-do

56:10.000 --> 56:13.420
But I be done seen
'bout ever'thing

56:13.503 --> 56:17.924
When I see a elephant fly

56:18.008 --> 56:21.094
With the wind.

56:21.177 --> 56:25.765
When I see a elephant

56:25.849 --> 56:28.351
Fly

56:36.026 --> 56:39.446
All right, you wise birds.
This has gone far enough.

56:43.950 --> 56:45.702
Quiet, gentlemen.

56:45.785 --> 56:48.455
The Reverend Rodent
is gonna address you.

56:48.538 --> 56:51.708
You ought a be ashamed
of yourselves.

56:51.791 --> 56:54.044
A bunch of big guys like you...

56:54.127 --> 56:57.464
pickin' on a poor
little orphan like him.

56:57.547 --> 57:01.801
Suppose you was torn away from
your mother when you was just a baby...

57:01.885 --> 57:04.304
nobody to tuck you in at nights...

57:04.387 --> 57:09.225
no warm, soft, caressin' trunk
to snuzzle into.

57:09.309 --> 57:11.645
How would you like to be
left out alone...

57:11.728 --> 57:15.148
in a cold, cruel, heartless world?

57:15.231 --> 57:18.485
And why? I ask ya, why?

57:18.568 --> 57:22.572
Just because he's got those big ears,
they call him a freak.

57:22.656 --> 57:24.741
The laughingstock of the circus.

57:24.824 --> 57:27.410
Then when his mother
tried to protect him...

57:27.494 --> 57:29.913
they threw her into the clink.

57:29.996 --> 57:33.750
And on top of that,
they made him a clown!

57:33.833 --> 57:36.753
Socially, he's washed up.

57:36.836 --> 57:41.091
Ah, but what's the use of talkin'
to you coldhearted birds?

57:41.091 --> 57:43.343
Go ahead. Have your fun.

57:43.426 --> 57:46.429
Laugh at him.
Kick him, now that he's down.

57:46.513 --> 57:49.015
Go on!

57:49.099 --> 57:51.017
We don't care.

57:58.191 --> 58:00.110
Come on, Dumbo.

58:05.615 --> 58:07.867
Hey, brother,
w-w-wait a minute.

58:07.951 --> 58:10.537
Uh, don't go away
feelin' like that.

58:10.620 --> 58:12.789
We done seen the light.

58:12.872 --> 58:14.791
You boys is okay.

58:14.874 --> 58:17.127
Please, you've done enough.

58:17.210 --> 58:21.548
Well, but we're all fixin' to help you.
Uh, ain't that the truth, boys?

58:21.631 --> 58:23.883
- Well, it sure is.
- Uh, yeah, that... You're right.

58:23.967 --> 58:26.803
You wanna make the elephant fly,
don't ya?

58:26.886 --> 58:30.390
Well, you gotta use a lot of' choplogic.
You know, psychology.

58:30.473 --> 58:33.560
Now, here's what you do.
First, you, uh...

58:33.643 --> 58:35.562
Uh, bu...

58:35.645 --> 58:38.565
And then, right after that,
you, uh...

58:41.067 --> 58:43.903
Use the magic feather.
Catch on?

58:43.987 --> 58:46.573
The magic feather?

58:46.656 --> 58:48.658
Yeah, I gotcha.

58:48.658 --> 58:52.329
Dumbo! Look! Have I got it!

58:52.412 --> 58:55.332
The magic feather!
Now you can fly!

58:59.419 --> 59:03.006
Let's go. Let's go.

59:03.089 --> 59:06.509
- Heave ho. Heave ho.
- Let's go, Dumbo.

59:06.593 --> 59:09.846
- Let's go. Let's go.
- Come on now.

59:09.929 --> 59:11.848
- Up, down. Up, down.
- Heave ho.

59:11.931 --> 59:14.184
- One, two, One, two. One, two.
- Heave ho.

59:14.267 --> 59:16.519
Faster, faster.
Get up flyin' speed.

59:16.603 --> 59:19.105
Retract your landing gear.
Raise your fuselage.

59:19.189 --> 59:21.107
Take off.

59:28.365 --> 59:30.367
Aw, it's no use, Dumbo.

59:30.450 --> 59:32.869
I guess it's just
another one of their... Look!

59:32.953 --> 59:35.705
Hot diggity! You're flyin'.

59:35.789 --> 59:37.707
You're flyin'!

59:40.293 --> 59:43.880
Uh, why, he flies
just like a eagle.

59:43.964 --> 59:46.299
That's better than a airplane.

59:46.383 --> 59:48.802
Brother, now I've seen everything.

59:50.887 --> 59:54.307
But I be done seen

59:54.391 --> 59:58.812
When I see a elephant fly

59:58.895 --> 01:00:00.981
With the wind.

01:00:01.064 --> 01:00:05.068
When I see a elephant

01:00:05.151 --> 01:00:07.737
Fly

01:00:07.821 --> 01:00:10.407
Dumbo, I knew you could do it!

01:00:10.490 --> 01:00:13.410
Wait'll we get to the big town.

01:00:13.493 --> 01:00:16.997
Boy, them city folks is

01:00:28.508 --> 01:00:31.344

Look at that house.

01:00:45.025 --> 01:00:48.028
you're standing
on the threshold of success.

01:00:48.111 --> 01:00:50.614
Don't look down.
It'll make you dizzy.

01:00:50.697 --> 01:00:54.367
Boy, are they in for a surprise.
Ho-ho.

01:00:55.452 --> 01:00:59.539

Uh-oh. The magic feather!

01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:22.729
Dumbo, come on. Fly.
Open them ears.

01:01:23.980 --> 01:01:26.900
The magic feather was just a gag.
You can fly.

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:29.986
Honest, you can.

01:01:30.987 --> 01:01:32.906

Now, loop the loop.

You're makin' history!

01:02:57.324 --> 01:02:59.909
I've seen a peanut stand

01:02:59.993 --> 01:03:02.329
I've seen a needle

01:03:02.412 --> 01:03:05.081
But I be done seen
