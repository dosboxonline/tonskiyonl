00:40.457 --> 00:43.836
- Where are they?
- Wha-- I came looking for my family.

00:44.419 --> 00:45.838
Just like you.

00:47.798 --> 00:48.799
Oh, yeah?

00:51.176 --> 00:52.261
Hey.

00:54.096 --> 00:55.597
I was there when you got this.

00:57.015 --> 00:58.976
You're the one who did this to me.

01:00.435 --> 01:01.478
To all of us.

01:02.271 --> 01:06.817
At the bare minimum, I'm as smart
as you, so don't fuck with me.

01:06.817 --> 01:07.943
Where are they?

01:08.610 --> 01:09.695
Okay.

01:10.529 --> 01:14.533
I'm sorry. I'm so s--

01:14.533 --> 01:17.578
Fuck you.
I don't want your fucking apology.

01:18.245 --> 01:19.872
Tell me where they are!

01:20.455 --> 01:22.416
Oh, fuck. I don't know.

01:27.296 --> 01:28.422
Oh, fuck.

01:28.422 --> 01:29.965
Where are they?

01:30.549 --> 01:31.758
Daniela found out.

01:32.342 --> 01:33.343
Of course she did.

01:34.511 --> 01:36.305
She's the one who
pushed me down the stairs.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.726
And I don't know where she is now.
I swear.

01:41.351 --> 01:44.396
- So you're fucking useless to me?
- I'm sorry.

04:13.504 --> 04:14.755
Mom.

04:22.387 --> 04:24.014
Let's turn them off, okay?

04:33.315 --> 04:36.443
When I came back, I thought
I'd only have him to deal with.

04:37.236 --> 04:39.238
I should've known there would be more.

04:42.074 --> 04:43.492
So where do we go?

04:45.410 --> 04:47.204
I really don't know.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.706
Credit cards can be tracked.

04:49.706 --> 04:52.125
No one really takes cash anymore.

04:52.125 --> 04:55.420
And even if I had an idea,
I can't be the one to choose.

04:56.713 --> 04:58.131
Why?

04:58.131 --> 05:01.009
'Cause any place he would think of,
they could too.

05:09.935 --> 05:11.144
I have an idea.

05:18.986 --> 05:20.654
That's the one.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.427
And you just happen to know
the security code?

06:28.430 --> 06:32.518
James's family spends their summers--
most weekends here.

06:32.518 --> 06:35.145
- I visited a couple of times.
- Couple of times?

06:38.148 --> 06:41.235
I think he's been here
more than a couple of times.

07:21.859 --> 07:22.985
How's your room?

07:32.411 --> 07:34.037
I should have protected her.

07:40.043 --> 07:41.253
Charlie...

07:47.217 --> 07:49.428
I should've protected both of you.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.724
None of this is your fault.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.726
You know that, right?

08:03.817 --> 08:05.652
Are they really all my dad?

08:10.991 --> 08:14.661
Yes and no.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.129
So what do we do?

08:28.592 --> 08:30.260
We figure it out...

08:32.513 --> 08:34.347
once we get some sleep.

09:07.381 --> 09:08.382
Hey.

09:09.758 --> 09:11.176
Do you wanna be alone?

09:25.566 --> 09:28.652
I can't imagine
the things that you've seen,

09:29.695 --> 09:31.780
all the things you had to do

09:32.781 --> 09:34.491
to get back to us.

09:38.620 --> 09:39.788
I want it...

09:41.206 --> 09:44.668
to just be as simple as you're home,

09:46.503 --> 09:48.881
we go back to the way we were...

09:52.926 --> 09:54.928
but they're all home too.

10:00.726 --> 10:02.561
I don't know where to start.

10:15.157 --> 10:17.159
Guess just like after Max.

10:18.577 --> 10:22.915
Somehow we just have to start.

12:52.231 --> 12:54.858
<i>None of you have been through
what I've been through.</i>

12:57.110 --> 12:58.403
<i>You haven't earned it.</i>

12:59.238 --> 13:02.908
<i>You know, we can't
all have them obviously, so...</i>

13:05.077 --> 13:08.330
<i>the question is, who gets stuck alone?</i>

13:09.331 --> 13:13.418
<i>What if we tried joint custody?</i>

16:07.384 --> 16:09.678
At first, I liked the way he made me feel.

16:14.725 --> 16:19.438
It was like we had gone back to the start.

16:22.566 --> 16:24.151
But he wasn't my husband.

16:26.737 --> 16:28.197
He lived with us,

16:29.823 --> 16:31.033
slept with me.

16:39.917 --> 16:41.543
That's all I wanna say right now.

16:45.589 --> 16:46.590
I'm sorry.

16:57.100 --> 16:59.520
I loved our life,

17:01.021 --> 17:05.108
but there were times
that I thought, "What if?"

17:07.277 --> 17:10.196
Not a constant thing, but sometimes.

17:12.991 --> 17:15.243
This other Jason, he is,

17:15.786 --> 17:17.621
to some degree, me.

17:19.248 --> 17:21.791
So my what-ifs are also in him.

17:21.791 --> 17:23.961
They led him to this world.

17:26.797 --> 17:28.549
None of it's your fault.

17:35.681 --> 17:38.684
You know, I met a version of you
that never married me.

17:40.644 --> 17:41.478
Yeah?

17:44.815 --> 17:46.149
What did I do?

17:46.149 --> 17:47.609
You're an artist.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.655
I met you at the opening
for your newest show.

17:51.655 --> 17:54.199
You lived in a really cool loft, and...

17:55.284 --> 17:56.827
you had a lot of friends.

17:58.912 --> 18:00.080
No kids?

18:01.081 --> 18:02.082
No.

18:05.335 --> 18:06.587
Was I happy?

18:11.091 --> 18:13.302
She wondered the same about you.

19:16.907 --> 19:20.536
No hotel charges,
no airline tickets, no Airbnb,

19:21.453 --> 19:25.832
no rental cars, but he buys
fucking gas at Schaumburg.

19:26.792 --> 19:29.586
And they take $500 out of the ATM.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.090
Where'd he go?

19:34.925 --> 19:36.134
Where'd he go?

19:36.134 --> 19:38.720
Come on. You should
be able to work this out.

19:38.720 --> 19:41.974
Wherever he would go, you would know.

19:41.974 --> 19:45.561
So you don't make the decision
because it's too predictable.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.188
I know Daniela too well.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.648
They'll let Charlie do it.

19:50.482 --> 19:51.650
Oh, fuck.

19:52.693 --> 19:55.988
Is there any chance
you haven't powered your phones down?

20:09.918 --> 20:11.211
Where's my phone?

20:17.551 --> 20:20.721
Where's my phone? The one that
you took from me under the train tracks.

20:23.265 --> 20:24.892
Where is my phone?

20:24.892 --> 20:26.310
Where is it?

20:26.310 --> 20:28.145
Listen, cut me loose.

20:29.021 --> 20:30.480
I'll help you find it.

20:31.523 --> 20:33.066
Why don't I just cut you?

20:35.152 --> 20:37.237
No. Look.

20:51.460 --> 20:52.336
Gotcha.

20:59.635 --> 21:00.761
Sorry...

21:20.405 --> 21:22.032
We should check on Charlie.

21:27.454 --> 21:28.455
Daniela?

21:34.461 --> 21:36.880
Last night, I found a message board

21:36.880 --> 21:40.217
with hundreds of Jasons
who'd made it back.

21:44.513 --> 21:45.764
What were they saying?

21:48.100 --> 21:53.146
As damaged as some of them have become,
they all love their family.

21:53.939 --> 21:55.274
They want you back.

21:56.024 --> 21:58.026
One of them had an idea.

21:59.903 --> 22:01.822
Kind of a lottery system,

22:02.990 --> 22:07.536
where apparently one of us gets to
stay in this world with you and Charlie.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.663
Everyone else leaves.

22:12.291 --> 22:15.460
Well, whoever had that idea
just lost the lottery.

22:19.047 --> 22:21.800
Another suggested shared custody.

22:23.510 --> 22:24.511
Wow.

22:25.429 --> 22:27.222
Holidays will be a nightmare.

22:33.687 --> 22:34.980
Hey.

22:36.106 --> 22:37.107
Hey.

22:38.150 --> 22:39.943
So what happened to you?

22:44.072 --> 22:45.407
What happened to me?

22:45.991 --> 22:47.034
Yeah.

22:47.034 --> 22:49.036
After you kidnapped me

22:49.036 --> 22:52.789
and played out a sick dad fantasy
with my son

22:52.789 --> 22:54.875
and raped my wife?

23:05.010 --> 23:08.805
I'll tell you what happened.
Your Daniela is dead.

23:08.805 --> 23:09.890
What?

23:12.142 --> 23:13.143
How?

23:13.143 --> 23:14.603
Well, it was my fault.

23:14.603 --> 23:15.729
Actually...

23:17.689 --> 23:18.982
it was your fault.

23:18.982 --> 23:22.152
Because I didn't know the kind of people
that you were involved with.

23:23.529 --> 23:26.490
Dawn killed her because
she was trying to help me.

23:27.491 --> 23:29.493
And Leighton had Ryan killed.

23:31.870 --> 23:34.164
And then there's Amanda,

23:35.082 --> 23:38.210
who you abandoned.

23:38.794 --> 23:43.590
She helped me escape in the box,
and she was very confused

23:43.590 --> 23:46.176
and disoriented and scared.

23:46.176 --> 23:48.554
And as you know,
they're not the kind of feelings

23:48.554 --> 23:51.682
you're supposed to have
when you open the door.

23:52.683 --> 23:56.270
The sixth door that we opened
was a big forest.

23:57.062 --> 24:00.357
We just stepped outside
just to have a look.

24:01.817 --> 24:02.860
And...

24:04.653 --> 24:07.531
there had been a fire, I guess.
It was very black.

24:07.531 --> 24:09.241
Blackened, you know?

24:09.241 --> 24:13.912
And so when a wind came,
it just started knocking trees down.

24:16.206 --> 24:19.042
This branch fell and...

24:20.169 --> 24:24.882
well, one hit me on the head,
but a really big one just came and went...

24:26.341 --> 24:27.551
right through her.

24:29.887 --> 24:31.597
Pinned her to the ground.

24:33.307 --> 24:35.809
And there was just nothing
that I could do about it...

24:39.021 --> 24:42.149
except just sit there
and wait for it to all be over.

24:45.986 --> 24:47.696
That took two days.

24:57.539 --> 24:59.082
Is that hers?

25:00.125 --> 25:01.168
Amanda's?

25:04.796 --> 25:07.049
She would've done anything for you.

25:08.383 --> 25:10.802
One hundred percent. Anything.

25:14.181 --> 25:16.517
Do you want to see
what other damage you've caused?

25:37.371 --> 25:39.289
Yeah, and it just goes on.

25:47.756 --> 25:49.383
I just thought...

25:50.884 --> 25:52.094
What did you think?

25:52.719 --> 25:54.221
It doesn't matter.

25:55.055 --> 25:56.056
Look at me.

25:57.349 --> 25:58.851
I would really like to know.

26:04.022 --> 26:05.065
I thought...

26:07.985 --> 26:09.319
I thought that...

26:11.655 --> 26:14.741
you would love my life.

26:49.193 --> 26:50.319
What else?

26:51.445 --> 26:53.071
Brooke and Drew are dating.

26:53.697 --> 26:54.948
I'm sorry, pal.

26:54.948 --> 26:56.742
Smells good in here.

26:57.367 --> 27:01.330
Yeah, I found some slightly expired
pancake mix and a can of condensed milk.

27:01.330 --> 27:05.209
Okay. I like our chances
with expired pancakes.

27:06.710 --> 27:07.794
What'd I miss?

27:07.794 --> 27:11.798
Well, I am catching up on current events
at the Dessen household.

27:11.798 --> 27:13.300
Speaking of which,

27:13.300 --> 27:16.094
what happened to that show
that you were trying to land?

27:16.637 --> 27:18.347
Don Good at Artspace got it.

27:18.347 --> 27:20.682
We are batting 1,000 here.

27:20.682 --> 27:21.975
Any good news?

27:25.646 --> 27:27.439
You got me a car for my birthday.

27:28.065 --> 27:31.610
- Yes, I heard.
- Excellent Blackhawks tickets.

27:31.610 --> 27:32.945
New skateboards.

27:32.945 --> 27:34.947
- Ice cream with nuts.
- What?

27:35.531 --> 27:37.199
Yeah, you almost killed me.

27:38.492 --> 27:41.495
Nah, but seriously, you didn't
know how to use an EpiPen.

27:42.454 --> 27:44.373
He wouldn't have known about your allergy.

27:44.373 --> 27:45.457
Yeah.

27:46.291 --> 27:49.211
Or Max. He missed our time by the tree.

27:51.630 --> 27:52.756
Well, he's a dick.

27:54.758 --> 27:56.176
Coffee?

27:57.719 --> 27:59.805
- I'd love some.
- Yeah? Same?

28:01.640 --> 28:03.642
The thing about these
is they make you think,

28:03.642 --> 28:06.436
"Why would you ever want a fresh pancake?"

28:07.688 --> 28:10.524
- Okay. Why are you doing this to me?
- It was perfect.

28:10.524 --> 28:12.693
- Thank you.
- Thank you for breakfast.

28:12.693 --> 28:17.030
You're welcome. But what's the plan?

28:18.240 --> 28:21.618
Don't really know yet. Just that we have
to leave here tomorrow.

28:21.618 --> 28:22.703
Why?

28:22.703 --> 28:25.455
Well, we're currently
home invaders and thieves.

28:26.540 --> 28:27.833
Did you take something?

28:29.251 --> 28:32.254
I just love how your mind
just went straight to me.

28:32.254 --> 28:36.592
Well, you did kind of thieve
my best friend's car.

28:36.592 --> 28:39.052
She kind of let me borrow it.

28:39.052 --> 28:42.181
Doesn't seem like there's really a plan
to give it back to her anytime soon.

28:42.181 --> 28:43.932
Well, we might need it.

28:44.600 --> 28:46.310
So, where will we go?

28:48.979 --> 28:50.731
We're working on it.

29:10.751 --> 29:11.752
Hello?

29:23.847 --> 29:24.973
Daniela?

29:26.934 --> 29:27.976
Charlie?

29:55.838 --> 29:56.839
Hello?

30:04.972 --> 30:05.973
Charlie?

30:24.658 --> 30:25.742
Hello?

30:43.802 --> 30:44.803
Jason?

30:56.940 --> 31:01.069
I know this seems very strange,

31:02.613 --> 31:05.699
but for Daniela's sake,
I need you to do something for me.

31:05.699 --> 31:06.783
What?

31:06.783 --> 31:09.077
Can you track your car's location?

31:12.623 --> 31:14.166
Can you? Can you track
your car's location?

31:14.166 --> 31:15.250
Yes.

31:15.250 --> 31:16.335
Have you?

31:16.335 --> 31:19.046
No. It didn't occur to me to track.

31:19.046 --> 31:21.965
- All right. Give me your phone.
- That would be a solid "fuck off."

31:21.965 --> 31:24.176
Blair, just give me your phone.

31:33.560 --> 31:34.853
I'm not gonna hurt you.

31:39.107 --> 31:41.443
Just give me your fucking phone.

31:42.819 --> 31:44.780
Blair, give it to me!

31:47.199 --> 31:48.242
Okay.

32:06.802 --> 32:10.013
- Sit down. Now!
- Yeah, fine. Yeah.

32:20.232 --> 32:21.191
Now...

32:22.776 --> 32:25.279
what the actual fuck is going on?

32:29.324 --> 32:30.951
Where are they?

32:31.869 --> 32:33.495
The other realities.

32:35.122 --> 32:39.168
Imagine you're a fish, swimming in a lake.

32:41.378 --> 32:44.590
And to you,
that lake is your entire universe.

32:45.382 --> 32:46.633
Then one day,

32:46.633 --> 32:50.429
someone reaches in
and pulls you out of the water,

32:51.430 --> 32:55.434
and you realize that what you thought
was your entire world is just one lake.

32:56.935 --> 33:00.272
Then you see another lake and trees

33:00.272 --> 33:01.899
and the sky above.

33:01.899 --> 33:05.694
And it suddenly hits you that you are--

33:06.695 --> 33:10.324
We all are part
of a more mysterious reality

33:10.324 --> 33:13.118
than we could ever possibly understand.

33:14.953 --> 33:19.917
So, they're just all around us

33:21.418 --> 33:23.128
and we can't see them?

33:23.128 --> 33:24.588
They're right here.

33:25.964 --> 33:28.675
So close, just microns away.

33:28.675 --> 33:30.969
And if our consciousness were more fluid,

33:30.969 --> 33:33.931
we could literally
reach out and touch 'em.

34:14.096 --> 34:15.639
Were there any worlds...

34:18.684 --> 34:20.518
where you were tempted to stay?

34:25.315 --> 34:28.610
Out there in the box, I almost--

34:30.362 --> 34:33.407
almost lost hope of finding my way home.

34:36.909 --> 34:40.246
There was one world
where I thought I could be happy.

34:45.127 --> 34:46.753
But you came home.

34:50.507 --> 34:51.884
Do you regret it?

34:54.636 --> 34:56.013
Not one bit.

36:42.119 --> 36:43.745
Ask another question.

36:47.124 --> 36:50.878
Hey. Come in. We're just chatting.

36:58.468 --> 37:01.388
Okay, now this just feels
suspiciously like a tuck-in.

37:01.889 --> 37:04.600
What, you too old for a tuck-in, huh?

37:09.730 --> 37:11.732
Thank you for bringing us here, Charlie.

37:14.693 --> 37:18.739
Considering this is pretty scary,
you're handling it with real bravery.

37:18.739 --> 37:20.616
I'm very proud of you, pal.

37:24.828 --> 37:25.996
Night, kiddo.

37:27.122 --> 37:28.123
Good night.

37:30.459 --> 37:31.710
All right.

38:17.047 --> 38:19.258
Do you remember when we first met?

38:22.845 --> 38:24.429
Could have been anyone...

38:26.515 --> 38:27.975
but it was you.

38:32.187 --> 38:33.814
And out of all of them,

38:35.190 --> 38:37.901
again it was you.

38:47.494 --> 38:49.329
I went on the message board.

38:52.291 --> 38:54.293
I told them we made a choice.

38:56.545 --> 38:58.005
I don't want a lottery.

39:02.176 --> 39:03.552
I choose you.

40:10.744 --> 40:11.578
Oh, shit.

40:26.468 --> 40:27.427
Help me.

40:28.637 --> 40:29.721
Who did this to you?

40:29.721 --> 40:32.683
One of us.

40:33.851 --> 40:35.269
How many are here?

40:36.270 --> 40:39.106
Am I gonna die? I don't wanna die.

40:39.106 --> 40:40.315
How many?

40:40.315 --> 40:41.775
Get Charlie.

40:42.526 --> 40:44.069
Where's Charlie?

40:46.029 --> 40:47.030
Hey!

40:51.451 --> 40:52.452
Oh, fuck.

40:53.036 --> 40:54.079
Plea--

40:57.666 --> 40:59.042
Was that a gunshot?

40:59.626 --> 41:03.297
Get Charlie. Meet me
back downstairs. Hurry!

41:08.635 --> 41:09.636
Hey.

41:19.313 --> 41:20.439
Drop it.

41:27.821 --> 41:29.323
I said drop it.

41:37.206 --> 41:38.207
Listen...

41:38.207 --> 41:40.584
Just stop. Stop.

41:49.885 --> 41:50.886
Are they upstairs?

41:52.763 --> 41:53.764
Yeah.

41:54.306 --> 41:56.016
Okay. Take off all your clothes.

41:56.892 --> 42:00.020
Now. I'm not gonna tell you again. Just--

42:00.020 --> 42:01.104
Come on.

42:04.233 --> 42:05.234
Everything.

42:10.781 --> 42:12.115
Do you have a safe word?

42:13.575 --> 42:14.576
Yeah.

42:16.036 --> 42:17.621
Give it to me.

42:18.789 --> 42:20.165
How many have you killed?

42:20.165 --> 42:21.625
I don't know.

42:23.669 --> 42:24.837
Safe word.

42:27.673 --> 42:30.300
Okay. I'll tell you.

42:33.053 --> 42:34.054
It's--

43:16.096 --> 43:19.600
Daniela, take Charlie and go. Go!

43:23.437 --> 43:24.605
Not without you.

43:24.605 --> 43:26.190
I'm not gonna stop you.

43:27.608 --> 43:29.401
It's not why I'm here.

43:50.047 --> 43:53.717
I'm the one who built the box.

43:55.260 --> 43:58.180
I'm the one responsible
for all of this mess.

44:07.814 --> 44:09.149
I'm so sorry.

44:10.484 --> 44:11.568
I'm sorry to all of you.

44:11.568 --> 44:12.778
Charlie!

44:16.114 --> 44:17.157
Fuck.

44:21.411 --> 44:22.871
How did you find us?

44:22.871 --> 44:24.998
Blair had a tracking app on her phone.

44:25.958 --> 44:27.751
How did the others find you?

44:27.751 --> 44:30.128
One of them put this device on the Honda,

44:30.128 --> 44:33.507
and I didn't realize it
until the others started showing up.

44:33.507 --> 44:34.842
They followed me.

44:36.009 --> 44:37.177
What the fuck?

44:38.428 --> 44:39.930
You have to leave.

44:41.223 --> 44:42.724
It's outside.

44:47.521 --> 44:50.023
Please. I am trying to help you.

44:59.825 --> 45:01.660
All right. Well, show us where it is.

45:03.245 --> 45:04.246
Okay.

45:21.013 --> 45:22.014
Jason.

45:25.350 --> 45:26.768
This belongs to you.

45:32.649 --> 45:35.027
Go. Go!

45:37.154 --> 45:40.282
Daniela! Charlie!

45:46.455 --> 45:47.289
Get down!

46:10.938 --> 46:13.065
Are you good? You okay?

46:17.319 --> 46:19.071
I don't think anyone followed us.

46:20.280 --> 46:23.075
What do we do?
There's nowhere for us to go.

46:31.625 --> 46:34.837
Guys, I think he left us something.

46:44.346 --> 46:45.848
How many are there?

46:45.848 --> 46:47.558
I don't know. Forty?

46:53.647 --> 46:54.982
There's a bag here too.

46:58.777 --> 47:00.070
He brought Max.

47:15.586 --> 47:16.962
And there's this here.

47:34.146 --> 47:38.066
<i>When I went into the box,
I was filled with regret.</i>

47:40.861 --> 47:43.405
<i>And then one day, I walked into a world</i>

47:43.405 --> 47:46.283
<i>and I found a family that had been created</i>

47:46.283 --> 47:49.286
<i>through a choice that I had been
too scared to make.</i>

47:57.836 --> 47:59.838
<i>I was burning with envy.</i>

48:01.256 --> 48:04.801
<i>At first, I thought
it was all about you, Daniela.</i>

48:05.552 --> 48:07.221
<i>And while some of it was,</i>

48:08.639 --> 48:11.475
<i>I realized what I really wanted,
what I tried to steal,</i>

48:11.475 --> 48:13.977
<i>were the choices that you made, Jason.</i>

48:14.895 --> 48:18.148
<i>Mostly the choice
to allow space in your life</i>

48:18.148 --> 48:20.526
<i>for someone else's needs and dreams.</i>

48:31.453 --> 48:34.623
<i>I think there's a part of us-- me--</i>

48:35.290 --> 48:37.876
<i>that's been afraid to risk love.</i>

48:38.544 --> 48:40.921
<i>And my whole life,
I've let that fear control me.</i>

48:40.921 --> 48:42.756
<i>But somehow you broke free of it</i>

48:42.756 --> 48:44.842
<i>and gifted yourself a full,</i>

48:45.843 --> 48:48.470
<i>messy and beautiful life.</i>

48:54.685 --> 48:58.397
<i>There's no apology
sufficient for what I've done.</i>

49:04.027 --> 49:06.572
<i>This world is no longer safe
for any of you.</i>

49:06.572 --> 49:10.242
<i>And I hope you can find a new home,
and I'm sure you will, because...</i>

49:13.579 --> 49:16.415
<i>well, you've all been through
things I can't imagine,</i>

49:17.332 --> 49:19.877
<i>and they've shaped you into
an even more perfect puzzle</i>

49:19.877 --> 49:21.920
<i>that can only fit one another.</i>

50:03.545 --> 50:05.631
You're sure this is the only way?

50:10.511 --> 50:12.596
If we stay, we have to live in fear.

50:14.223 --> 50:15.474
She's right.

50:41.124 --> 50:42.125
Wait.

50:45.712 --> 50:48.632
Look. There they are.

50:48.632 --> 50:52.386
Hey. Hey, look. Daniela.

50:52.386 --> 50:54.012
Shit. That's him.

50:54.805 --> 50:56.265
Where's he going?

50:56.765 --> 50:57.891
They're here.

50:57.891 --> 50:59.810
We didn't come to stop you.

51:00.561 --> 51:04.731
We figured that your only chance
at a normal life was to leave this world.

51:04.731 --> 51:06.525
Yeah. He's right. Uh-huh.

51:07.276 --> 51:08.777
We came to say goodbye.

51:52.112 --> 51:53.322
I'm sorry.

51:54.031 --> 51:58.535
I just want you and Charlie to be safe.

51:58.535 --> 51:59.870
Yeah.

52:00.704 --> 52:01.747
And you...

52:04.416 --> 52:05.626
take care of them.

52:05.626 --> 52:06.793
Yeah.

52:29.858 --> 52:34.446
No! Why should he get them?

52:34.446 --> 52:35.656
It's not about him.

52:36.490 --> 52:38.242
It's about what she wants,

52:39.076 --> 52:40.827
and what's best for our son.

52:44.873 --> 52:46.250
Let 'em through.

52:48.669 --> 52:49.670
No.

52:52.422 --> 52:53.632
Let 'em through!

53:03.308 --> 53:04.393
Move!

53:05.811 --> 53:07.229
Let 'em through!

53:39.720 --> 53:41.430
Charlie. Charlie.

53:46.852 --> 53:48.145
Daniela.

57:06.260 --> 57:07.553
Do you know me?

57:08.303 --> 57:09.304
No...

57:11.890 --> 57:13.600
but I've been looking for you.
