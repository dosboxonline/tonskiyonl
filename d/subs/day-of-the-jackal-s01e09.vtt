00:00.000 --> 00:04.400
The following programme contains
strong language and violent scenes.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.800
You're an artist, my friend.

00:20.160 --> 00:22.479
3,815 metres.

00:22.480 --> 00:23.999
You need military training

00:24.000 --> 00:26.039
to make a shot
at even half that distance.

00:26.040 --> 00:27.759
There is one guy.
Alexander Duggan

00:27.760 --> 00:29.999
was an outstanding sniper.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.839
But he's dead.

00:31.840 --> 00:34.399
He went to Afghanistan.
The entire unit was wiped out.

00:34.400 --> 00:36.320
But there was no body.

00:39.040 --> 00:40.559
Something's not right.

00:40.560 --> 00:43.479
So, Isabel tells me you want to
have a look at a STRAP 2 file,

00:43.480 --> 00:46.759
because you think it'll
- help you find the Jackal?
- Yes.

00:46.760 --> 00:48.279
I'll take the file, Osi.

00:48.280 --> 00:50.199
This way, Mr. Halcrow.

00:50.200 --> 00:53.519
We need to talk.
It a full blown mole hunt.

00:53.520 --> 00:56.279
I don't want her here, Paul.
No one's trying to speak to you.

00:56.280 --> 00:59.039
I'm trying to talk to my husband...
Please, just go back inside, yeah.

00:59.040 --> 01:00.559
Are you coming home?

01:00.560 --> 01:03.399
Or are you staying here
with your fucking ex-wife?

01:03.400 --> 01:05.400
Fuck you, you tyrant!

01:06.280 --> 01:09.599
Tallinn was our one chance
and he missed.

01:09.600 --> 01:12.679
UDC wants the world to know...

01:12.680 --> 01:15.239
that River will flow.

01:17.440 --> 01:18.759
Are you coming tomorrow?
Yes.

When I was a little boy,

04:34.840 --> 04:37.079
my grandmother, my mum's mother,

04:37.080 --> 04:38.719
from Hebron,

04:38.720 --> 04:41.279
told me there's a fine line

04:41.280 --> 04:43.599
between being revered

04:43.600 --> 04:45.879
and being spat on.

04:45.880 --> 04:48.039
And here we are,

04:48.040 --> 04:50.040
it's a beautiful day...

04:51.440 --> 04:53.240
and no one's spitting on me.

04:54.320 --> 04:55.799
They're just trying to kill me.

04:55.800 --> 04:59.040
They can try,
but they'll never do it.

05:01.400 --> 05:02.719
But...

05:02.720 --> 05:04.560
if I don't make it...

05:07.360 --> 05:10.959
promise me...
you'll make River happen.

05:10.960 --> 05:14.279
Ulle, I could promise,
but we both know I'd be lying.

05:14.280 --> 05:16.120
The board hates River.

05:17.240 --> 05:19.840
They do what you want
because they're afraid of you.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.239
You mean in awe of me.

05:22.240 --> 05:24.279
Yes, that's what I meant.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.840
They're not in awe of me.

05:27.080 --> 05:31.119
So, I suppose you'll just have to
stay alive, won't you.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.960
Captain Baldwin, how you feeling?

06:35.320 --> 06:36.720
Fucking terrible.

06:38.120 --> 06:39.720
Mm.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.280
Lung cancer...

06:44.520 --> 06:47.320
from the burn pits
in Helmand, is that right?

06:48.240 --> 06:50.440
Eight of your men died there,
didn't they?

06:51.800 --> 06:54.999
I'm so sorry that happened.

06:55.000 --> 06:59.240
That must have been
a hellish experience for you.

07:00.160 --> 07:04.120
What can you tell me
about Alexander Duggan?

07:06.280 --> 07:08.479
You're not a doctor.

07:08.480 --> 07:10.119
Who are you?

07:10.120 --> 07:11.439
I'm with Six.

07:11.440 --> 07:13.719
I need to ask you some questions...

07:13.720 --> 07:15.759
about what happened in Helmand.

07:15.760 --> 07:19.879
It's all in the report.
I think you should leave now.

07:19.880 --> 07:23.279
I can't. Not until
you've answered my questions.

07:23.280 --> 07:26.359
I'm not talking to MI6. Get out.

07:26.360 --> 07:29.479
I want the nurse.

07:29.480 --> 07:32.120
I want the nurse.

07:33.240 --> 07:36.079
Of course. The nurse will come
once we've had our chat.

07:36.080 --> 07:38.400
I need more morphine.

07:39.520 --> 07:42.080
Then talk quickly.

08:11.600 --> 08:13.480
Yep?

08:15.280 --> 08:17.680
Ah. Come in, Bianca.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.199
I've been trying to get into plants.
But I keep killing everything.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.679
Ah, tough habit to break.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.519
Also... it's boring as fuck.

08:28.520 --> 08:32.439
I want to update you
on the Jackal investigation.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.799
I have some more
information on Duggan.

08:34.800 --> 08:36.839
Apparently, he was a loner.

08:36.840 --> 08:38.279
Sit down.

08:38.280 --> 08:41.119
The only person he was close with
was his spotter,

08:41.120 --> 08:43.719
a guy called Gary Cobb.

08:43.720 --> 08:45.719
So if Duggan's alive,

08:45.720 --> 08:48.439
it's possible that Cobb
is alive, too.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.199
It's possible, but it's unlikely.
There's no evidence.

08:51.200 --> 08:52.319
But it's a lead.

08:52.320 --> 08:55.039
It's a theory more than a lead,
let's be honest.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.560
Well, I'd like to test that theory
and see if I can find anything.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.039
I don't think
that's going to be possible.

09:01.040 --> 09:02.760
Why?

09:04.520 --> 09:06.519
Because I'm closing
the investigation.

09:06.520 --> 09:07.959
You can't do that.

09:07.960 --> 09:10.319
I can't make decisions
based on hunches.

09:10.320 --> 09:12.559
People have died.
Too many people.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.439
But I have a limited
amount of resources

09:14.440 --> 09:17.239
and one man is not
worth all this loss.

09:17.240 --> 09:19.240
So we just admit defeat?

09:21.480 --> 09:24.799
You really must learn to think
in a less binary way.

09:24.800 --> 09:26.319
I am closing in on him.

09:26.320 --> 09:30.039
It's not about you, Bianca,
and your need for closure.

09:30.040 --> 09:32.359
This is about the big picture.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.999
The greater good.

09:34.000 --> 09:36.279
I just need a little more time.

09:36.280 --> 09:38.320
And I need you to move on.

09:41.240 --> 09:42.760
And if I don't?

09:47.040 --> 09:50.160
I don't think you'll like
the answer to that question.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.279
'Hi, this is Osita Halcrow,
please leave a message.'

09:56.280 --> 09:58.239
Osi, it's Bianca.

09:58.240 --> 10:00.360
Where are you? Call me, please.

10:03.240 --> 10:05.040
Have you heard?

10:05.840 --> 10:07.240
What?

10:08.080 --> 10:09.919
You haven't seen Osi today,
have you?

10:09.920 --> 10:13.119
No. Have I heard what?

10:13.120 --> 10:15.160
It's...

10:17.960 --> 10:20.800
Why am I here again, Carver?
Pick up, pick up, pick up.

10:21.840 --> 10:25.399
Well, we still have
unanswered questions

10:25.400 --> 10:27.879
about information
getting into the wrong hands.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.239
About Norman, about Belarus...

10:30.240 --> 10:32.879
...about Hungary.
We've been over that.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.639
is why your phone records

10:36.640 --> 10:40.319
showed you received texts
from a number in the United States.

10:40.320 --> 10:42.599
But when we looked for the texts,

10:42.600 --> 10:44.999
you had deleted them.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.119
Yeah.

15:25.120 --> 15:27.360
D'you kill people for money?

15:32.040 --> 15:33.840
Yeah.

15:35.080 --> 15:37.599
Say it.
Say what?

15:37.600 --> 15:39.880
Say the words.

15:44.960 --> 15:47.320
Say the words.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.119
I kill people for money.

15:51.120 --> 15:53.439
Sorry, what?

15:53.440 --> 15:55.239
No te oigo. I can't hear you.

15:55.240 --> 15:57.599
What did you say?

15:57.600 --> 15:59.999
I kill people for money.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.040
Say it again.

16:03.040 --> 16:06.839
I kill people for money.
Listen to yourself and say it again.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.199
I kill people for money.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.679
Again.
I kill people for money.

16:10.680 --> 16:12.599
Say it again!
I kill people for money.

16:12.600 --> 16:15.199
I kill people for money.
Is that what you wanna hear?!

16:15.200 --> 16:17.279
Is that enough?!

16:17.280 --> 16:19.159
Is it enough?!

16:28.000 --> 16:29.800
It's not.

16:32.240 --> 16:34.640
But now we can have a conversation.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.320
So you're not dead.

17:00.560 --> 17:02.839
Why have you not been
answering your phone?

17:02.840 --> 17:04.680
I've been busy.

17:09.560 --> 17:13.279
I found out that Duggan and his
spotter Gary Cobb were inseparable.

17:13.280 --> 17:15.399
So?
So?

17:15.400 --> 17:19.240
This operation has been closed down.
As I'm sure you know.

17:20.880 --> 17:24.559
I'm sorry, what is going on, Osi?!

17:24.560 --> 17:27.719
Someone clearly doesn't give
two shits if the Jackal kills UDC-

17:27.720 --> 17:30.920
Don't take this personally,
but please shut the fuck up!

17:33.840 --> 17:35.759
No.

17:35.760 --> 17:37.400
I can't.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.039
I...

17:41.040 --> 17:43.680
I-I'm not having this conversation.

17:45.240 --> 17:48.519
Look, you can ignore me all you want

17:48.520 --> 17:50.439
but I'm just disappointed.

17:50.440 --> 17:52.639
I thought out of all the fucking
dickheads around here,

17:52.640 --> 17:55.519
you... were the one
that was different.

17:55.520 --> 17:57.519
In this job,

17:57.520 --> 17:59.960
different is inadvisable.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.560
Osi?

18:33.600 --> 18:36.000
Is Angela home?
She's upstairs.

19:04.880 --> 19:06.480
Is everything OK?

19:08.640 --> 19:11.040
No.

19:12.320 --> 19:16.240
No, nothing's "OK" right now.

19:18.840 --> 19:21.239
I've always been...

19:21.240 --> 19:24.359
clear about what I want

19:24.360 --> 19:26.999
and-and why I'm doing it-
About your work?

19:27.000 --> 19:30.160
Yeah, but everyth-I don't wanna
talk about your work, Bianca.

19:31.200 --> 19:32.239
OK.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.159
Because that's what a husband does.

19:34.160 --> 19:36.480
And I don't know what I am
to you right now.

19:37.480 --> 19:40.079
I don't know where we're headed.
I know where I wanna be headed.

19:40.080 --> 19:42.639
Yeah, I know where I wanted
to be headed, too.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.679
But what we want
and what's actually possible,

19:44.680 --> 19:47.120
they are two very different-
I miss you.

19:50.400 --> 19:52.400
Yeah, I miss you, too.

19:59.480 --> 20:02.280
And I know I'm a nightmare.

20:05.640 --> 20:07.479
And this is where you say,

20:07.480 --> 20:09.799
"You're not a nightmare, Bianca.
You're great."

20:09.800 --> 20:12.640
You ARE a nightmare.
But you love it though.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.519
No?

20:16.520 --> 20:19.399
You love me.
I do love you.

20:19.400 --> 20:21.319
And I love you,
and isn't that what matters?

20:21.320 --> 20:23.000
No.

20:24.400 --> 20:26.959
Bianca, you're not here...
you're not here because of us.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.879
You're here because of
a problem at work.

20:28.880 --> 20:31.799
That's-That's not...
That's not completely true.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.959
Look, you were
really young when you had Jasmine.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.959
OK, you were really young...
Yeah, exactly.

20:43.960 --> 20:45.519
...to make that choice.
Exactly.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.519
But it's not a one-time choice.

20:47.520 --> 20:51.039
OK, you've got to keep
choosing it every day.

20:51.040 --> 20:53.360
Not just when things
aren't working out for you.

20:54.200 --> 20:55.599
But bec...

20:55.600 --> 20:57.840
because it's what you really want.

21:01.440 --> 21:03.240
Erm...

21:04.280 --> 21:05.919
Look, if...

21:05.920 --> 21:08.239
Y'know, if Angela
sees you here, she's...

21:08.240 --> 21:10.480
she's gonna lose her shit, so...

21:12.040 --> 21:13.999
Yeah.

21:31.960 --> 21:34.560
Did you think you could live
two parallel lives?

21:37.640 --> 21:40.400
I honestly never thought about it.

21:42.760 --> 21:45.079
But I'm gonna stop.

21:45.080 --> 21:46.839
It's over. Done.

21:46.840 --> 21:49.080
Finished. It's done.

21:51.200 --> 21:53.719
Really?
Yeah, really.

21:53.720 --> 21:55.560
Yeah.

21:59.040 --> 22:00.840
But?

22:08.040 --> 22:09.679
Charles.

22:09.680 --> 22:11.720
There's one more job...

22:13.160 --> 22:15.160
that I have to finish.

22:17.480 --> 22:19.480
All I need is 24 hours.

22:27.320 --> 22:29.520
Where you going?

22:30.480 --> 22:32.280
I need a coffee.

23:14.920 --> 23:16.280
Alvaro.

24:41.280 --> 24:43.600
What's wrong?

24:49.480 --> 24:51.880
Alvaro just told me
that he's been talking...

24:52.760 --> 24:54.560
to Jimmy Tejero.

24:55.520 --> 24:57.399
Jimmy Tejero, por Dios!

24:57.400 --> 24:59.160
Who's Jimmy Tejero?

25:00.560 --> 25:02.319
He's a fucking gangster.

25:02.320 --> 25:04.399
He's dangerous.

25:04.400 --> 25:06.239
The worst person
you can meet in Cadiz!

25:06.240 --> 25:08.599
Alvaro was talking about me?
Yeah.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.599
I don't trust Alvaro.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.839
He's... He's made
some promises to Jimmy,

25:12.840 --> 25:15.119
because he knows that...

25:15.120 --> 25:16.879
that you have money and...

25:16.880 --> 25:19.719
and what you do, and...
I don't know what else!

25:19.720 --> 25:21.159
If Jimmy knows about you,

25:21.160 --> 25:23.119
we're not safe.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- And Carlito.

25:23.120 --> 25:26.840
Look at me.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.639
Look at me.

25:29.640 --> 25:32.480
Whoever this is, whatever this is...

25:34.080 --> 25:35.439
I'm gonna make this OK.

25:35.440 --> 25:38.159
Hmm?
OK.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.679
Yeah?

25:39.680 --> 25:41.320
Yeah.

25:42.560 --> 25:44.320
Yeah.

26:02.840 --> 26:04.080
Alvaro?

26:06.840 --> 26:09.039
Charlie.
Hi.

26:09.040 --> 26:10.839
Hi.

26:10.840 --> 26:13.519
So, I hear you need some help?

26:13.520 --> 26:15.199
- Yeah.
- Yeah?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

26:15.200 --> 26:17.119
Erm...

26:17.120 --> 26:19.239
OK, uh...

26:19.240 --> 26:21.359
Listen...

26:21.360 --> 26:23.039
I have a...

26:23.040 --> 26:26.159
a good business opportunity

26:26.160 --> 26:29.479
for you, for me, for everybody.

26:29.480 --> 26:32.960
OK, so where and when d'you need me?

26:34.000 --> 26:35.479
So you're coming?
Yeah.

26:35.480 --> 26:36.679
You're coming?
Yeah.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.639
OK. OK, OK.

26:38.640 --> 26:40.839
Where? Uh, you know...

26:40.840 --> 26:43.079
La Victoria?
- Yeah.
- The beach?

26:43.080 --> 26:44.959
You know the big hotel
with the restaurant...

26:44.960 --> 26:46.639
Oh, the Sierra.
...in the beach.

26:46.640 --> 26:48.399
Sierra. Hotel Sierra, yeah.

26:48.400 --> 26:51.119
OK, what time?
Mm, one?

26:51.120 --> 26:52.879
One o'clock at the Sierra.

26:52.880 --> 26:55.039
One, Sierra Hotel, you and me?

26:55.040 --> 26:57.520
- Yeah.
- OK?OK.

27:03.600 --> 27:05.279
Thank you.

27:05.280 --> 27:07.880
Very much, very much.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.520
And don't worry that...

27:12.640 --> 27:15.799
we have wine, good time,
and you pay nothing, eh?

27:15.800 --> 27:17.639
This one I pay.

27:32.400 --> 27:35.279
So, Marjorie,
what's on your mind?

27:35.280 --> 27:39.039
The Board wants you
to postpone River for one month.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.719
Absolutely not.

27:40.720 --> 27:43.399
The DagHaus share price
is in freefall.

27:43.400 --> 27:45.559
In the last three days
you've personally lost

27:45.560 --> 27:47.279
1.2 billion dollars.

27:47.280 --> 27:49.280
This is media driven panic.

27:50.040 --> 27:52.640
DagHaus is much more than River.

27:53.600 --> 27:55.679
Our technologies and applications

27:55.680 --> 27:57.960
are fundamental
to the world economy.

27:59.560 --> 28:01.040
But...

28:01.840 --> 28:04.319
let me make one thing...

28:04.320 --> 28:06.439
perfectly clear.

28:06.440 --> 28:08.719
If a level playing field,

28:08.720 --> 28:11.559
like the one River
will make possible,

28:11.560 --> 28:14.439
means that super rich people
like you and me

28:14.440 --> 28:16.839
will have to give up
our yachts and private jets

28:16.840 --> 28:18.319
so that young people

28:18.320 --> 28:20.360
can have a decent future...

28:22.120 --> 28:23.719
well, personally,

28:23.720 --> 28:25.999
that's something I embrace

28:26.000 --> 28:28.080
with open arms.

28:29.240 --> 28:30.959
OK.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.879
If you launch tomorrow,

28:32.880 --> 28:34.999
the entire board will walk.

28:35.000 --> 28:38.719
I am here with their
explicit approval.

28:38.720 --> 28:40.760
Well, if you all wanna go...

28:41.840 --> 28:44.119
I guess you'll just have to go.

28:44.120 --> 28:46.600
You really won't consider
a postponement?

28:47.440 --> 28:49.999
River launches tomorrow.

29:04.520 --> 29:06.520
Thank you.

29:08.480 --> 29:11.359
Jeremy. Good to see you again.
Pleasure as always, Tim.

29:11.360 --> 29:12.680
Please.
Thank you.

29:24.240 --> 29:27.999
Yes, yes. I'm sorry
I don't have better news.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.679
But, um...
Well, I did speak to my colleague,

29:30.680 --> 29:32.879
the Business Secretary,
about the possibility

29:32.880 --> 29:35.119
of the European courts
placing an injunction

29:35.120 --> 29:37.199
to stop the release of River.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.879
But, um, well frankly,

29:39.880 --> 29:41.879
he's not optimistic,

29:41.880 --> 29:44.199
and neither am I.

29:44.200 --> 29:45.880
Sorry.

29:46.840 --> 29:49.399
"When we would
accomplish great things,

29:49.400 --> 29:52.400
the best policy
is to work by an engine...

29:53.160 --> 29:55.559
which the world never sees."

29:55.560 --> 29:56.799
Yes.

29:56.800 --> 29:58.839
I forget, who said that?
Well, it's...

29:58.840 --> 30:01.959
It's very true.
Rather brilliant.

30:01.960 --> 30:04.959
Oh! Maybe it was me?

30:04.960 --> 30:07.239
Yes.

30:07.240 --> 30:09.639
Yes, maybe it was you.

30:09.640 --> 30:12.119
So, all we have left

30:12.120 --> 30:13.960
is our Hail Mary...

30:14.720 --> 30:17.279
the Jackal.
Yes, quite.

30:17.280 --> 30:18.880
Where is the Jackal now?

30:26.040 --> 30:28.039
Oh-ho-ho!

30:28.040 --> 30:29.479
Charles.

30:29.480 --> 30:32.319
Since a long time.

30:32.320 --> 30:33.999
Too long. How are you?

30:34.000 --> 30:36.799
- - Fine.
- Yeah!
- You?
You look very well. You look trim.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.599
Oh, thank you.

30:38.600 --> 30:41.399
Thank you so much
for sorting this last minute.

30:41.400 --> 30:44.479
For how long you want to fish?
Just a couple of hours, I think.

30:44.480 --> 30:47.559
Yeah, I just need to...
disconnect a little.

30:47.560 --> 30:50.439
So, you have a big relax.
Yeah.

30:50.440 --> 30:53.159
Water's perfect. So, just...

30:53.160 --> 30:55.800
leave the keys in the usual place.
Great, will do.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.079
OK.
Thanks, Guillermo.

30:59.080 --> 31:00.920
Good luck.
Bye.

34:38.720 --> 34:40.960
No, it's not.

35:23.200 --> 35:26.039
"Sniper-style shot.
The operation displayed

35:26.040 --> 35:28.120
a high degree
of precision and skill."

35:34.640 --> 35:37.079
So, I've been trying to get a shot
of the Calandra Lark

35:37.080 --> 35:39.079
for the past couple of years.

35:39.080 --> 35:41.999
Do you know the Calandra Lark?
It's a very beautiful bird.

35:42.000 --> 35:45.000
I heard that there's
a breeding pair on Plavnik Island.

35:45.920 --> 35:49.119
Why you want to go
to Plavnik is your business.

35:49.120 --> 35:52.280
You paid, I'll take you.

36:01.640 --> 36:03.640
Can we stop here, please?

36:04.600 --> 36:06.519
You want to stop here?

36:06.520 --> 36:08.839
Yes, I think
I've seen something up there.

36:12.120 --> 36:14.120
Yeah, I've seen something.

36:30.840 --> 36:32.959
What's that?

36:32.960 --> 36:35.000
It's a lot of kit.

38:36.880 --> 38:38.880
Five hours.

38:41.760 --> 38:44.599
Are you planning
on staying in bed till then?

38:44.600 --> 38:46.919
I had a terrible night.

38:46.920 --> 38:49.479
I don't think I can face
swimming today.

38:49.480 --> 38:51.639
Ulle, you're not
breaking your routine

38:51.640 --> 38:53.959
on the biggest day of your life.

38:56.600 --> 38:58.959
A swim does you good.
It clears your head.

38:58.960 --> 39:00.559
You always say that.

39:00.560 --> 39:02.400
Come on.

39:45.680 --> 39:48.280
Whose boat is that?
Bogdan's.

39:49.640 --> 39:53.159
I haven't seen Bogdan
stop to fish there before.

39:53.160 --> 39:55.439
It's outside the two mile perimeter.

39:55.440 --> 39:57.199
I know, but keep an eye on it.

39:57.200 --> 39:59.240
Roger that.

40:19.800 --> 40:21.399
Good morning, sir.
Morning.

40:21.400 --> 40:22.599
Everything's ready.

40:22.600 --> 40:25.239
As always, your minder will be
next to you at all times and-

40:25.240 --> 40:27.879
Can we just go?
He knows the drill.

40:27.880 --> 40:29.720
Yes, sir.

40:33.840 --> 40:35.919
Principal exiting the villa now.

40:35.920 --> 40:38.240
Roger that.

40:58.240 --> 41:00.839
All call signs, this is Zero Alpha,

41:00.840 --> 41:03.439
Principal on route
and heading to Sierra.

41:03.440 --> 41:05.720
All stay vigilant,
Drone overwatch focused on...

41:08.480 --> 41:09.759
...report. Out.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.640
Security team Delta One providing-

41:15.120 --> 41:17.720
All clear. Perimeter secure.
Thank you.

41:22.760 --> 41:25.439
Proceed.
