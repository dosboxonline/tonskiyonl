- He was wearing a mask.

44:33.587 --> 44:35.756
Honestly, I'm in no position--

44:35.881 --> 44:38.216
Well, I am. I'm right
in the fucking thick of it.

44:38.217 --> 44:40.051
My son got snatched from me.

44:40.052 --> 44:42.303
From everything that he knows.
And he's out there somewhere.

44:42.304 --> 44:44.597
Scared shitless.
And that's killing me.

I'm gonna do something

44:48.352 --> 44:49.602

to fuck this up,
