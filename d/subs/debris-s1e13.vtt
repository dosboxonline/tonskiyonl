WEBVTT

00:04.629 --> 00:06.965
The piece that
we’re looking for,

00:07.007 --> 00:08.591
I remember what it does.

00:08.633 --> 00:11.553
INFLUX believes it can create
a kind of map

00:11.594 --> 00:13.722
showing the location
of every piece.

00:13.763 --> 00:15.265
(power surging)

00:15.306 --> 00:18.852
FINOLA:
Orbital is weaponizing
the Debris.

00:18.893 --> 00:20.353
-Are you ready?
-Okay.

00:20.395 --> 00:21.938
FINOLA:
We thought we were in control,

00:21.980 --> 00:24.024
but we are in the presence
of something bigger,

00:24.065 --> 00:26.026
the ball of light.

00:26.067 --> 00:27.986
GEORGE: The race for Debris
and the power that it holds,

00:28.028 --> 00:29.612
it could end here.

00:29.654 --> 00:32.741
MAN: George identified
the location of the piece.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.079
(exhales)

00:59.893 --> 01:00.852
(engine starts)

01:23.166 --> 01:25.543
-(car bell dings)
-(crowd chatters)

02:25.061 --> 02:26.730
* (theme)

02:55.717 --> 02:59.304
-(phone rings)
-BRYAN: Maddox. Hey.

02:59.346 --> 03:01.431
MADDOX (on phone):
Anson Ash escaped
from the black site.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.683
-How?
-Killed a guard,

03:03.725 --> 03:05.018
jacked himself
with a defibrillator

03:05.060 --> 03:06.603
and teleported out.

03:06.644 --> 03:09.397
We got some X-rays
from the prison last night.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.859
Bryan, he has shards of Debris
all through his body.

03:12.901 --> 03:14.652
BRYAN:
Were they experimenting
on themselves?

03:14.694 --> 03:16.654
Our guys think
he ingested them,

03:16.696 --> 03:18.573
and they phased
into different organs.

03:18.615 --> 03:21.951
I tried to get
a read through CCTV,

03:21.993 --> 03:23.370
get a pin on where he went.

03:23.411 --> 03:25.080
-I wanted you to know.
-BRYAN: Great.

03:25.121 --> 03:27.791
All right, listen,
I gotta go. I’ll be in touch.

03:27.832 --> 03:28.792
BRYAN: Thanks.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.964
Maddox.

03:35.006 --> 03:36.508
INFLUX.

03:36.549 --> 03:39.010
I just don’t want
my father to be running

03:39.052 --> 03:41.763
and hiding
for his whole life.

03:41.805 --> 03:46.559
As long as they’re out there,
he will never be safe.

03:46.601 --> 03:50.021
I just thought, with his
ideas behind us, that...

03:52.565 --> 03:55.568
...um, that we would be able
to stop INFLUX.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.237
Anson being in prison
was a good start.

03:57.278 --> 04:00.615
We are going to protect
your father for as long
as it takes.

04:02.909 --> 04:03.993
I hope.

04:13.962 --> 04:15.046
(bird twittering)

04:37.193 --> 04:38.486
(door opens)

04:49.664 --> 04:54.294
Let’s go!
We have to leave!

04:54.336 --> 04:57.172
Dad, what are you wearing?

04:57.213 --> 05:01.551
Protection for the radiation
from the radio waves.

05:01.593 --> 05:02.927
I was working on the antennas.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.637
(Finola, indistinct)

05:04.679 --> 05:06.890
We have to leave!

05:10.435 --> 05:12.145
I’ve got the coordinates
for the mapmaker,

05:12.187 --> 05:14.147
but the signal’s getting weaker.

05:14.189 --> 05:16.775
We-- We have to leave.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.071
I guess we’re leaving.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.532
(engine starts)

05:35.502 --> 05:38.463
Are you okay?

05:38.505 --> 05:42.050
Yeah. Yes, I’m fine.

05:47.013 --> 05:49.849
GEORGE: Take a left here.
We’re getting closer.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.434
(device beeping)

06:22.424 --> 06:25.176
(car stereo blaring)

06:25.218 --> 06:26.553
What’s going on here?

06:51.244 --> 06:53.121
(beeping increases)

06:59.377 --> 07:01.087
Who are these people?

07:01.129 --> 07:03.465
GEORGE:
That’s a very good question.

07:33.078 --> 07:35.663
GEORGE:
They’re all facing east.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.461
Hello. Can you hear me?

07:41.503 --> 07:44.547
-Hi.
-BRYAN: Hello.

07:44.589 --> 07:48.218
FINOLA: This is
like what happened to
the techs at the warehouse.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.223
(device scanning)

07:55.350 --> 07:57.268
Low.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.895
Huh.

07:58.937 --> 08:01.898
You said this was
a "map maker" piece, George,

08:01.940 --> 08:05.151
a piece you might not even
notice you had.

08:05.193 --> 08:08.154
This isn’t map making.

08:08.196 --> 08:12.242
And now we’re standing
out here with no suits.

08:12.283 --> 08:15.704
It’s too late for suits.

08:15.745 --> 08:18.248
The suits wouldn’t be
of any use anyway.

08:18.289 --> 08:21.543
They weren’t designed
for this type of Debris.

08:21.584 --> 08:24.838
These-- These people
were brought here.

08:24.879 --> 08:27.924
They came by car, so presumably,

08:27.966 --> 08:31.511
they were affected
before they even got here.

08:31.553 --> 08:36.558
But somehow they knew
to be here.

08:39.602 --> 08:44.399
This Debris could be affecting
people 20 miles around.

08:44.441 --> 08:47.736
And we were done the minute
we hit the parking lot.

08:48.903 --> 08:53.241
So will the same
thing happen to us?

08:53.283 --> 08:54.868
I don’t know.

08:54.909 --> 08:57.704
The techs started dying
two hours after exposure.

08:57.746 --> 09:00.290
Dad. Dad!

09:04.419 --> 09:07.714
The only way to find out
is to keep moving forward.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.507
We have to find the Debris.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.551
We have to examine it.

09:11.593 --> 09:12.802
I need to look at it.

09:14.012 --> 09:15.638
BRYAN: Hey!

09:40.455 --> 09:42.999
I can feel it, an energy.

09:44.501 --> 09:49.172
Can you? I can feel it.

09:49.214 --> 09:50.298
(laughs)

09:52.342 --> 09:54.135
(laughter grows)

10:20.203 --> 10:21.413
What is this?

10:21.454 --> 10:23.498
It’s emotional convergence.

10:23.540 --> 10:24.624
BRYAN:
What does that mean?

10:24.666 --> 10:27.460
Come on! No! Come on!

10:27.502 --> 10:30.088
-(all shouting)
-Hey! What are we gonna do?

10:32.215 --> 10:33.425
(George chuckles)

10:39.931 --> 10:41.891
(shouting continues)

10:44.602 --> 10:46.688
It’s beautiful!

10:46.730 --> 10:48.481
(screams)

10:48.523 --> 10:49.858
(shouting stops)

11:13.340 --> 11:15.842
-Devin Reece.
-Two E’s?

11:17.344 --> 11:19.554
-Two E’s.
-All right. Got it.

11:21.348 --> 11:25.727
So these people are affected
but somehow we’re not?

11:25.769 --> 11:29.814
Are we saying that the Debris
is just selecting people
for its own purposes?

11:29.856 --> 11:32.025
I don’t know. But it seems
like we’re entering

11:32.067 --> 11:34.819
some sort of new phase.

11:34.861 --> 11:37.822
(inhales)
Whoo!

11:37.864 --> 11:39.240
That one smelled like vanilla.

11:39.282 --> 11:43.161
This smells like baby diapers.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.705
Almost as bad as
the tech section on the plane.

11:45.747 --> 11:47.207
You mean
your side of the plane?

11:47.248 --> 11:48.541
Almost.

11:52.379 --> 11:56.091
-Mercedes Russell.
-Mercedes Russell.

11:57.842 --> 11:59.511
Can I ask you a question?

11:59.552 --> 12:01.513
FINOLA:
Yeah.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.639
It might sting a bit.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.599
Wow. That sounds ominous.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.520
We’re putting all of our faith

12:08.561 --> 12:10.522
in your father,

12:10.563 --> 12:14.818
and he was reanimated
through his eye.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.362
They restarted his brain,

12:17.404 --> 12:19.572
and he can’t remember
where he was six months ago.

12:19.614 --> 12:21.658
(device beeping)

12:21.700 --> 12:24.494
He can’t remember
why Maddox wants him dead.

12:24.536 --> 12:26.955
He’s marching around
in his tined foil cape;

12:26.996 --> 12:29.249
his memory’s foggy at best.

12:31.292 --> 12:34.254
Just doesn’t feel right.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.344
He could be wrong
about all of it.

12:43.346 --> 12:45.015
Maybe they told him something,

12:45.056 --> 12:47.976
and he just doesn’t remember it.

12:48.018 --> 12:50.729
That’s dangerous.

12:50.770 --> 12:54.816
All I know is that they
brought him back to find it.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.609
So it must be important.

12:58.611 --> 13:02.198
(device beeping rapidly)

13:12.625 --> 13:13.585
(all cheering)

13:43.865 --> 13:46.451
You...

13:46.493 --> 13:48.912
are...

13:48.953 --> 13:50.872
Dario.

13:50.914 --> 13:54.793
You are Dario.

13:54.834 --> 13:56.169
I...

13:59.631 --> 14:00.715
am...

14:04.469 --> 14:05.720
Mom.

14:07.722 --> 14:09.015
I am Mom.

14:14.979 --> 14:16.523
LINDA:
Hi, Julia.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.609
Hey, Linda. Thanks for going.

14:19.651 --> 14:23.029
You know what? Just leave
those. I’ll deal with them.

14:23.071 --> 14:25.573
Okay. I’m just going
to put the next load in.

14:37.377 --> 14:39.087
IRINA:
Nice car.

14:41.715 --> 14:43.341
I almost left.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.759
No, you didn’t.

14:48.805 --> 14:51.766
(Irina speaks native language)

14:51.808 --> 14:53.768
(man speaks native language)

14:56.771 --> 14:59.441
(Irina continues)

15:03.737 --> 15:05.405
(Irina continues)

15:15.665 --> 15:17.834
-(device beeps)
-(man speaks native language)

15:22.714 --> 15:25.050
FINOLA: Take a look
at their social media profiles.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.302
They all have
two things in common.

15:27.344 --> 15:28.928
They all live
within 25 miles of here,

15:28.970 --> 15:32.182
and they all have newborns.

15:32.223 --> 15:34.059
Interesting.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.353
BRYAN:
After becoming a parent,

15:36.394 --> 15:38.313
you’re in a heightened emotional
state; emotionally raw.

15:38.355 --> 15:41.941
Higher highs, lower lows,

15:41.983 --> 15:43.943
the joy of having a child,

15:43.985 --> 15:46.613
the postpartum depression,

15:46.654 --> 15:48.990
and the fear
of getting it wrong.

15:49.032 --> 15:50.658
So it’s seeking out people in

15:50.700 --> 15:55.080
specific vulnerable emotional
states, studying them?

15:55.121 --> 15:58.458
Trying to absorb them,
somehow.

16:03.213 --> 16:06.132
Feeding off them emotionally.

16:09.135 --> 16:11.221
What’s taking Otto so long?

16:33.076 --> 16:34.327
You ready?

16:35.537 --> 16:36.830
As I’ll ever be.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.757
-What have you done?
-Let’s hit the road.

17:38.391 --> 17:40.894
(engine starts)

17:48.693 --> 17:50.487
FINOLA:
Yeah. They just keep coming.

17:52.822 --> 17:56.618
Sometimes they’re unloading,
and sometimes they’re not.

17:56.659 --> 17:59.871
It’s so strange.
It’s like it’s happening
in cycles.

17:59.913 --> 18:04.209
We have to figure out
a way to shut this place
down and free these people.

18:04.250 --> 18:05.919
I’ll get the N-Us
from the SUV,

18:05.960 --> 18:07.671
we might be able to disrupt it.

18:07.712 --> 18:12.008
Yes, and I’ll see
if I can recalibrate them.

18:33.697 --> 18:36.199
Never forget
how much I love you.

18:51.381 --> 18:53.550
MADDOX:
We’re good.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.302
(case latches clicking)

19:03.476 --> 19:06.980
You know I can’t let you leave
with that case, right?

19:11.026 --> 19:12.235
I mean, you know that.

19:15.572 --> 19:18.908
There’s another door
for you, Irina,

19:18.950 --> 19:21.619
one only you can go through.

19:26.207 --> 19:29.044
(device clicking)

19:29.085 --> 19:32.255
Do you think you can
manipulate the N-Us?

19:32.297 --> 19:35.592
Pretty soon others are going
to come looking for them, Dad.

19:37.886 --> 19:41.723
They can ping cell phones,

19:41.765 --> 19:43.141
and then get GPS on cars.

19:45.310 --> 19:49.064
Police will be called,
and then the FBI...

19:49.105 --> 19:52.233
and that leads to Orbital
and then Maddox.

19:52.275 --> 19:54.152
I can’t let them find you, Dad.

20:03.036 --> 20:05.080
The N-Us won’t work.

20:05.121 --> 20:07.749
I didn’t think they would.

20:07.791 --> 20:09.459
Well, let me tell Bryan.

20:09.501 --> 20:14.547
I needed to distract Bryan
so that I can talk to you alone.

20:16.466 --> 20:19.678
-Okay.
-There’s some things
you need to understand.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.309
Try to move this.

20:29.854 --> 20:31.690
You want me to touch it?

20:31.731 --> 20:33.692
It’s okay. I just want
to demonstrate something
to you.

20:35.235 --> 20:36.945
-It’s all right.
-No, Dad. Don’t.

20:36.986 --> 20:39.197
This one won’t hurt us.

20:49.541 --> 20:51.710
Come.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.504
It’s all right.

21:08.018 --> 21:09.269
GEORGE: Go ahead.

21:21.865 --> 21:23.700
Yeah.

21:26.327 --> 21:29.581
Although his piece of Debris
is relatively small.

21:29.622 --> 21:32.584
It’s weight right now
at this moment,

21:32.625 --> 21:36.171
because of the psychic
connection to those people
out there,

21:36.212 --> 21:39.466
is that of a large building.

21:41.009 --> 21:44.429
And it cannot be moved...

21:44.471 --> 21:47.140
as long as their minds
are linked to it.

21:47.182 --> 21:49.434
To get it out of here,

21:49.476 --> 21:53.396
we have to sever the link
between the Debris
and those people.

21:53.438 --> 21:59.069
This process will have
an adverse effect on them.

22:00.528 --> 22:03.114
What kind of adverse effect?

22:03.156 --> 22:07.535
Their memories will
be wiped completely.

22:07.577 --> 22:09.788
And there’s nothing
you can do about it.

22:09.829 --> 22:14.167
And you’re going to have
no choice but to allow it
to happen.

22:14.209 --> 22:16.586
FINOLA:
Don’t we always have a choice?

22:16.628 --> 22:18.546
-GEORGE: Hmm.
-I’ll figure out a way.

22:18.588 --> 22:21.049
You are such
a compassionate person.

22:21.091 --> 22:23.259
You always have been.

22:23.301 --> 22:25.095
You’ve got so much
of your mother in you.

22:26.054 --> 22:28.932
Oh. I’ll find a way.

22:28.973 --> 22:31.726
I’ve done it before,

22:31.768 --> 22:33.812
and I’ll do it again.

22:33.853 --> 22:37.649
No, there’s no time.

22:37.691 --> 22:40.193
What do you mean,
we don’t have time?

22:40.235 --> 22:43.738
We’ve been here
well over two hours,

22:43.780 --> 22:47.242
and they haven’t died
like the people
in the warehouse.

22:47.283 --> 22:49.119
It’s not the same thing.

22:49.160 --> 22:50.537
I mean, yes,
they’re being held,

22:50.578 --> 22:52.914
but my instincts are good.

22:52.956 --> 22:54.332
Dad, we can do this.

22:56.918 --> 22:59.838
There’s no more time.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.298
Why do you keep saying that?

23:02.340 --> 23:05.802
Because INFLUX operatives
are almost here.

23:11.141 --> 23:13.601
How could you possibly
know that?

23:15.812 --> 23:17.522
Because I called them.

23:23.903 --> 23:29.325
Why would you say that
you have called INFLUX?

23:29.367 --> 23:30.952
I’m going to tell you
something that

23:30.994 --> 23:33.288
at first you’re going
to wish I hadn’t.

23:33.329 --> 23:37.709
-Dad!
-I took my life

23:37.751 --> 23:41.838
to allow myself a rebirth,
and I paid the price.

23:43.298 --> 23:44.632
I want you to know this.

23:44.674 --> 23:48.094
That not one day goes by that--

23:48.136 --> 23:52.557
that I don’t think of you
and your sister.

23:52.599 --> 23:53.850
I want you to know this.

23:53.892 --> 23:57.604
What are you talking about?
A rebirth?

23:57.645 --> 23:59.606
That’s not what happened.

23:59.647 --> 24:02.609
They did this to you.

24:02.650 --> 24:05.945
You didn’t allow yourself
anything.

24:05.987 --> 24:09.157
Remember that first night
in the hotel,

24:09.199 --> 24:15.288
I told you that this was bigger
than you, me, your sister?

24:15.330 --> 24:17.665
-Yes.
-And I told you I needed

24:17.707 --> 24:20.794
the Laghari files to find this.

24:20.835 --> 24:23.421
Yes. What does this have
to do with INFLUX?

24:23.463 --> 24:29.511
If we can’t help people,
we do not deserve this Debris.

24:32.430 --> 24:37.894
Okay. I came,
and and I found you.

24:39.854 --> 24:41.898
Do you remember that?

24:41.940 --> 24:43.316
Tell me that you remember that.

24:43.358 --> 24:45.485
Look at me. Tell me
that you remember that.

24:45.527 --> 24:47.487
You didn’t.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.239
I knew you were coming.

24:51.324 --> 24:52.742
You just came too early.

24:52.784 --> 24:55.995
What are you saying?
What are you saying?

24:56.037 --> 24:58.289
What do you mean,
you knew?

24:58.331 --> 25:02.377
This Debris has given me
more than even I expected.

25:02.419 --> 25:04.546
Sweetheart,
you’ve seen it.

25:04.587 --> 25:08.299
The U.S.has been weaponizing
the Debris.

25:08.341 --> 25:10.593
So have other countries.

25:10.635 --> 25:14.347
They cannot be trusted
to be the guardians

25:14.389 --> 25:15.765
of this technology.

25:16.808 --> 25:18.935
Putting it in the hands
of the people

25:18.977 --> 25:22.772
so that they have the power
to resist governments

25:22.814 --> 25:26.359
and use this technology
for good.

25:26.401 --> 25:28.611
This is what we need to do.

25:28.653 --> 25:32.032
No! What you are saying
is wrong.

25:33.074 --> 25:35.035
Why are you talking
this way?

25:35.076 --> 25:36.619
Bryan was right.

25:36.661 --> 25:42.292
This isn’t a map-making
piece of Debris.

25:44.002 --> 25:46.588
This piece,
in concert with others,

25:46.629 --> 25:50.258
will enable the transformation
of the human mind

25:50.300 --> 25:55.388
so that humanity can ascend
to a higher plane

25:55.430 --> 25:57.349
of consciousness and thought.

25:57.390 --> 25:59.225
Dad, this isn’t you.

25:59.267 --> 26:04.814
I know you.
This isn’t you.

26:04.856 --> 26:06.816
They have done something
to you.

26:06.858 --> 26:09.194
-No.
-Oh my-- This isn’t you.

26:09.235 --> 26:13.281
I have never lied
to you about what I believe

26:13.323 --> 26:15.617
this Debris can give to us.

26:15.658 --> 26:17.243
What have you done?

26:19.996 --> 26:22.791
You never wanted to go
into the pool.

26:24.959 --> 26:29.923
I had to throw you in,
and you kicked and screamed
and--

26:29.964 --> 26:31.966
But you always did better
that way.

26:44.813 --> 26:46.231
Nice to see you again.

26:50.819 --> 26:53.697
(phone ringing)

26:59.661 --> 27:02.372
(ringing continues)

27:04.457 --> 27:05.959
(phone beeps)

27:06.001 --> 27:09.004
-Bryan!
-Hello, Bryan.

27:09.045 --> 27:10.005
Yes.

27:12.340 --> 27:14.467
BRYAN: There are still
more people arriving.

27:14.509 --> 27:17.846
Yes, yes. We have decided
against the N-U’s.

27:17.887 --> 27:19.931
-It’s too dangerous.
-Then what can we do?

27:19.973 --> 27:21.641
We’re gonna try
something else.

27:21.683 --> 27:24.811
Let us know if there’s
any change in their behavior.

27:24.853 --> 27:26.563
BRYAN: Okay.

27:26.604 --> 27:32.610
-I was worried about you.
-Why? What did you see?

27:32.652 --> 27:34.654
Nothing that’s clear.

27:34.696 --> 27:38.033
Call it instinct.

27:40.368 --> 27:45.832
What happened?
It’s active. Functioning.

27:45.874 --> 27:48.126
A Telesphere was born yesterday.

27:50.962 --> 27:53.673
Came from a pocket dimension
inside Orbital.

27:53.715 --> 27:56.718
I think it’s birth may have
triggered the Debris.

27:58.845 --> 28:00.889
Any idea with the sphere is now?

28:00.930 --> 28:04.392
No. There’s been
no reports about it either.

28:06.227 --> 28:08.897
LOEB:
You must be very proud.

28:08.938 --> 28:11.149
You have the right to be.

28:13.234 --> 28:15.445
Sometimes the world
gets a leader

28:15.487 --> 28:18.406
that just defies it all.

28:20.700 --> 28:23.078
He has something in mind,

28:23.119 --> 28:25.789
something only he can see.

28:27.374 --> 28:30.418
A visionary. Okay?

28:32.712 --> 28:35.340
He knows what we could be,

28:36.758 --> 28:38.927
what we would be,

28:40.929 --> 28:43.473
and what we should be.

28:43.515 --> 28:45.392
INFLUX.

28:51.731 --> 28:53.233
Humanity.

28:57.821 --> 29:02.117
I don’t want to kill you,
but I will if I have to.

29:19.342 --> 29:21.553
How long will it take
for them to die?

29:23.722 --> 29:25.265
How long’s a piece of string?

29:28.977 --> 29:30.437
(device whirrs)

29:30.478 --> 29:32.439
I’ll make it as quick
as I can.

29:35.734 --> 29:37.277
Likely a brain hemorrhage.

29:41.322 --> 29:43.283
No.

29:43.324 --> 29:46.619
I want you
to turn it off slowly.

29:46.661 --> 29:48.371
Ease them off the bottle.

29:49.914 --> 29:53.043
Their minds
will still be wiped.

29:53.084 --> 29:57.297
I want you to do that.
Things can be learned again.

30:00.967 --> 30:02.260
(device whirrs)

30:11.394 --> 30:12.562
The beans.

30:47.555 --> 30:48.932
You have to ingest this.

30:50.558 --> 30:52.852
It’ll provide you
with a protective envelope

30:52.894 --> 30:54.646
against the effect.

30:54.688 --> 30:57.440
It’ll prevent your mind
from being wiped.

30:57.482 --> 31:01.695
There are at least
50 innocent people there.

31:01.736 --> 31:05.281
This is the only way
to disengage them
from the Debris.

31:05.323 --> 31:09.077
Turn it off,
so we can move it.

31:16.084 --> 31:17.919
And what about Bryan?

31:17.961 --> 31:20.505
He won’t be alone
in his sacrifice.

31:20.547 --> 31:24.426
-You’re doing--
-I won’t lose you again.

31:34.728 --> 31:36.521
(straining)

31:45.488 --> 31:49.409
(indistinct)

31:49.451 --> 31:51.619
(panting)

31:58.668 --> 32:00.420
Stop this.

32:00.462 --> 32:01.588
Stop this.

32:01.629 --> 32:03.465
Just stop this!

32:05.592 --> 32:06.634
Stop it.

32:06.676 --> 32:08.303
I’m sorry.

32:19.731 --> 32:22.442
(beeping)

33:03.983 --> 33:07.654
Careful, careful, careful,
you cretin.

33:08.780 --> 33:11.032
Careful,
the finesse of a butcher.

33:20.125 --> 33:24.087
-Finola.
-Bryan.

33:26.923 --> 33:28.717
I must say.

33:30.427 --> 33:32.303
He’s a tough one, ain’t he?

33:32.345 --> 33:36.766
Just stay down. Stay down.
They’re with INFLUX.

33:36.808 --> 33:41.021
Otto, how does he even
know what day it is?

33:42.605 --> 33:44.232
(winces)

33:47.861 --> 33:50.655
Look at me, young man.

33:50.697 --> 33:53.033
Look at me.

33:53.074 --> 33:55.035
-(grunts)
-There.

33:55.076 --> 33:58.163
See? I’m not going to hurt you.

33:59.497 --> 34:01.583
How do you remember anything?

34:04.002 --> 34:06.046
Why didn’t it affect you?

34:12.469 --> 34:14.220
(chuckles)

34:17.640 --> 34:20.560
I know who you are.

34:23.480 --> 34:26.816
You’re the third man.

34:26.858 --> 34:28.985
The third man!

34:29.027 --> 34:32.947
Garcia, Ming, and you.

34:32.989 --> 34:34.449
Leave him alone.

34:34.491 --> 34:37.827
You did a wonderful job
in hiding your identity.

34:39.954 --> 34:41.414
Who are you?

34:42.916 --> 34:45.460
Who are you?

34:48.171 --> 34:49.631
Let’s go.

35:09.943 --> 35:11.778
It was wonderful meeting you.

35:19.786 --> 35:21.579
FINOLA:
Why?

35:21.621 --> 35:23.456
Why?

35:23.498 --> 35:29.337
I can show you.
You belong with me.

35:29.379 --> 35:31.881
No. No. I don’t.

35:31.923 --> 35:34.759
You belong with me.

35:36.011 --> 35:38.930
Look at me.
Look into my eyes.

35:38.972 --> 35:44.436
If I tell you that there are
things that you have no idea of,

35:44.477 --> 35:47.981
that there are things
about Debris that I know,

35:48.023 --> 35:52.652
things that I believe
that you need to know.

35:52.694 --> 35:57.365
Tell me. Am I lying?

35:59.492 --> 36:03.204
You belong with me,
your father.

36:06.666 --> 36:11.504
My father,
died six months ago.

36:13.965 --> 36:15.216
And you are not him.

36:28.355 --> 36:30.231
This technology will be free.

36:39.115 --> 36:40.367
Hey, you okay?

36:42.077 --> 36:43.661
I don’t know.

36:46.748 --> 36:48.583
I think so.

36:48.625 --> 36:50.585
FINOLA: Who was that?
What was that all about?

36:53.588 --> 36:57.592
When it all started falling...

36:57.634 --> 37:01.971
I was injured in
a Debris event with Garcia,

37:02.013 --> 37:03.765
and a Chinese agent named Ming.

37:07.435 --> 37:10.605
I have been taking injections
for it,

37:10.647 --> 37:14.526
as a precaution
to stave off something.

37:14.567 --> 37:16.194
What? Stave off what?

37:16.236 --> 37:17.570
They don’t know.
Maybe nothing.

37:17.612 --> 37:19.489
This is the first time
that something

37:19.531 --> 37:21.574
has happened because of it.

37:25.995 --> 37:28.707
I’ve never seen that man
before in my life.

37:33.670 --> 37:35.505
We need to tell Maddox
everything.

37:37.173 --> 37:38.425
Yeah.

37:42.804 --> 37:43.888
(engine revving)

37:45.598 --> 37:48.059
OTTO: It would never have
worked out with that girl,

37:48.101 --> 37:50.270
not in any iteration.

38:21.551 --> 38:24.637
Linda, is everything okay?
What you still doing here?

38:24.679 --> 38:27.724
Julia didn’t feel well
and went upstairs to take a nap.

38:39.444 --> 38:40.612
Hey, Julia.

38:48.328 --> 38:49.829
Julia?

38:57.045 --> 38:59.798
Honey? Julia?

39:01.841 --> 39:03.426
Craig.

39:03.468 --> 39:05.970
It’s okay. It’s okay.

39:06.012 --> 39:09.265
I almost did something
so stupid.

39:09.307 --> 39:11.309
I almost did it.

39:11.351 --> 39:13.603
It’s okay.

39:13.645 --> 39:15.522
I’m here, you’ll be all right.

39:20.402 --> 39:21.569
I can’t do this anymore.

39:21.611 --> 39:23.196
-I know.
-Okay?

39:23.238 --> 39:24.989
I need you to help me.

39:25.031 --> 39:26.908
I want you to come with me.

39:30.328 --> 39:31.705
(phone vibrates)

39:33.540 --> 39:35.542
(humming, whiriring)

39:51.391 --> 39:52.642
JULIA:
What is that?

40:15.206 --> 40:16.249
Mom?

40:16.291 --> 40:19.169
(gasping)

40:19.210 --> 40:22.881
Oh, oh...

40:22.922 --> 40:24.966
Oh, my God.

40:29.095 --> 40:31.931
How?

40:31.973 --> 40:34.267
Yes. Mom.

40:34.309 --> 40:36.895
Mom. Oh, my God.

40:36.936 --> 40:38.730
(sobbing)

41:13.348 --> 41:15.058
You’ve had a long journey.

41:16.393 --> 41:19.104
My name is Dahkeya.

41:55.557 --> 41:57.475
INFLUX just obtained
the piece

41:57.517 --> 41:59.602
in a quarry in Virginia.

42:01.187 --> 42:02.897
Then it’s time.

42:22.208 --> 42:23.835
Let’s begin.

42:30.050 --> 42:31.176
(beep)

42:32.344 --> 42:33.553
(beep)

42:33.595 --> 42:34.763
(beep)

42:42.562 --> 42:43.897
(beep)

42:43.938 --> 42:45.106
(beep)

42:45.148 --> 42:47.192
(digital warbling)

42:49.986 --> 42:51.404
(beep)

42:51.446 --> 42:53.073
(beep)

42:53.698 --> 42:54.824
(beep)
