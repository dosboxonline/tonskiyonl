CHRIS: (IN ENGLISH) I ran away,
but you didn't even look for me.

01:20:48.348 --> 01:20:49.474
(IN MANDARIN) Come here.

01:21:06.325 --> 01:21:12.873
Do you remember when Vivian ran away
when she was 14?

01:21:19.588 --> 01:21:25.010
She asked me to sleep over
at Annie's house,

01:21:26.428 --> 01:21:27.429
and I didn't let her.

01:21:28.347 --> 01:21:31.266
She looked me straight in the eyes
and said,

01:21:31.558 --> 01:21:35.062
(IN ENGLISH)
"Mama, I just want to let you know

01:21:35.062 --> 01:21:36.939
"that I hate you."

01:21:39.399 --> 01:21:41.026
(IN MANDARIN) And then she ran away.

01:21:41.735 --> 01:21:42.945
She was gone for three days.

01:21:45.113 --> 01:21:46.990
I was so scared.

01:21:50.369 --> 01:21:53.205
Then one day, she just came home.

01:21:54.248 --> 01:21:56.625
She didn't talk to me.

01:21:56.625 --> 01:21:57.876
Didn't acknowledge me.

01:21:58.961 --> 01:22:00.838
But I was so happy.

01:22:05.676 --> 01:22:08.303
Compared to her, you are not so stubborn.

01:22:09.596 --> 01:22:11.890
So I knew you would come home.

01:22:19.481 --> 01:22:20.482
You know,

01:22:22.067 --> 01:22:26.280
sometimes I sit and think about...

01:22:28.407 --> 01:22:33.704
How I ended up here.

01:22:35.330 --> 01:22:36.415
So ordinary.

01:22:39.251 --> 01:22:43.505
Is this what my life has amounted to?

01:22:46.884 --> 01:22:48.635
I wonder...

01:22:48.635 --> 01:22:54.016
What if I didn't marry your father?

01:22:54.766 --> 01:22:57.728
If I didn't have you and Vivian.

01:22:57.728 --> 01:22:59.396
What would my life be like?

01:23:01.315 --> 01:23:04.818
Maybe I would've come to America
by myself.

01:23:06.236 --> 01:23:08.739
And I'd have become
a successful artist by now

01:23:09.656 --> 01:23:12.701
with my own studio in new York.

01:23:15.954 --> 01:23:16.997
(CHUCKLES)

01:23:16.997 --> 01:23:18.916
(IN ENGLISH) Sometimes I dream.

01:23:22.586 --> 01:23:26.632
(IN MANDARIN) But then, getting
to watch you and Vivian grow up here,

01:23:27.341 --> 01:23:28.592
make friends,

01:23:30.177 --> 01:23:34.306
and learn so many things
I can't teach you,

01:23:36.433 --> 01:23:38.352
I realize...

01:23:38.352 --> 01:23:40.521
You are my dream.

01:23:42.356 --> 01:23:46.151
How could I be ashamed of you?

01:23:48.987 --> 01:23:51.573
(IN ENGLISH) I am so proud.

01:23:56.995 --> 01:24:00.457
But sometime, it's a little hard.

01:24:03.627 --> 01:24:04.962
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

01:24:10.175 --> 01:24:11.635
(IN MANDARIN) Come here.

01:24:33.907 --> 01:24:35.617
ORTHODONTIST: That's it.

01:24:35.617 --> 01:24:37.369

01:24:39.288 --> 01:24:41.415
PHOTOGRAPHER: Ready? Smile.

01:24:41.415 --> 01:24:43.250
(CAMERA CLICKING)

01:24:49.214 --> 01:24:51.216
And tilt your head a little bit.

01:24:51.216 --> 01:24:53.427
- And three, two, one.

01:25:34.593 --> 01:25:35.761

01:25:37.638 --> 01:25:39.097
Oh, hi.

01:25:39.848 --> 01:25:41.016
Hey.

01:25:41.016 --> 01:25:43.018
Good luck.

01:25:43.018 --> 01:25:44.186
What's up?

01:25:44.811 --> 01:25:46.188
Nothing much.

01:25:46.855 --> 01:25:48.023
Uh...

01:25:49.316 --> 01:25:52.194
Did you, uh... did you get a haircut?

01:25:53.987 --> 01:25:55.280
No.

01:25:56.323 --> 01:25:57.324
Right.

01:25:59.451 --> 01:26:00.994
Uh...

01:26:00.994 --> 01:26:03.330
I just... just came over here to say

01:26:03.330 --> 01:26:04.414
that I'm, uh,

01:26:05.082 --> 01:26:07.459
you know, sorry for not texting you back.

01:26:08.544 --> 01:26:12.130
Uh, I was kind of, like, busy with, like,

01:26:12.965 --> 01:26:15.008
you know, family stuff and...

01:26:16.885 --> 01:26:18.387
...back-to-school shopping and...

01:26:19.930 --> 01:26:21.056
Uh...

01:26:21.932 --> 01:26:23.141
Yeah, I...

01:26:24.059 --> 01:26:26.144
You're a pretty cool person,
so I was just, you know,

01:26:26.144 --> 01:26:29.982
wondering if you want to, like,
hang out again ever.

01:26:35.070 --> 01:26:36.154
You, uh...

01:26:37.322 --> 01:26:39.908
You punched my friend Josh in the face.

01:26:42.953 --> 01:26:44.705
Yeah. Yeah, I...

01:26:47.165 --> 01:26:49.960
- Yeah.
- Okay, well, later.

01:26:53.172 --> 01:26:54.590

WOMAN: Hi, guys.
Welcome to Visual Arts Club.

01:27:25.996 --> 01:27:29.416
This year, we're doing a mural,
some more analog photography,

01:27:29.416 --> 01:27:30.667
and we just got a big donation
of video equipment.

01:27:30.667 --> 01:27:32.044
SOUP: Yo, Wang-Wang!

01:27:32.044 --> 01:27:34.254
So we're hoping to make more video art...

(IN ENGLISH) Uh, yeah.

01:28:19.842 --> 01:28:21.426
Yeah, it-it was pretty good.

01:28:22.302 --> 01:28:25.264
I, um, signed up for Visual Arts Club.

01:28:26.515 --> 01:28:28.100
- Oh.
- Yeah.

the damage done is all</i>
