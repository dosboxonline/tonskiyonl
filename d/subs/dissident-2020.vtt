WEBVTT

02:35.503 --> 02:37.766
I didn't want to believe
in the beginning,

02:37.809 --> 02:39.898
what happened to Jamal.

02:39.942 --> 02:41.813
Prominent Saudi journalist

02:41.857 --> 02:43.554
andWashington Post columnist

02:43.598 --> 02:45.339
has gone missing
after visiting

02:45.382 --> 02:47.210
his country's consulate
in Istanbul.

02:50.866 --> 02:54.652
Yes, I knew that I was
doing something dangerous.

02:54.696 --> 02:56.480
But I didn't know that,
you know,

02:56.524 --> 02:59.440
we're going to lose
so many lives because of it.

03:01.093 --> 03:02.965
On Tuesday, Jamal Khashoggi

03:03.008 --> 03:04.575
entered the Saudi consulate

03:04.619 --> 03:06.621
in Istanbul
but hasn't been seen since.

03:08.188 --> 03:10.015
Saudi and Turkish officials

03:10.059 --> 03:11.887
have given conflicting accounts

03:11.930 --> 03:13.932
on the whereabouts
of Jamal Khashoggi,

03:13.976 --> 03:15.499
who's known for criticizing

03:15.543 --> 03:18.154
Crown Prince Mohammed
bin Salman's policy

03:18.198 --> 03:20.025
inside Saudi Arabia.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.853
Once an adviser and friend

03:21.897 --> 03:23.638
of Saudi's royal and elites,

03:23.681 --> 03:26.336
he now lives in self-exile
in the U.S.

03:26.380 --> 03:30.210
and is an outspoken critic
of his government's policies.

03:47.792 --> 03:49.272
Turkish authorities believe

03:49.316 --> 03:51.100
prominent Saudi journalist,

03:51.143 --> 03:53.233
Jamal Khashoggi,
has been killed.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.252
...what I want in my retirement.

06:23.295 --> 06:25.863
I'm 60 years old,
and I want to enjoy life,

06:25.907 --> 06:27.212
and I want to be free.

06:27.256 --> 06:28.997
Unfortunately,
the government treated me

06:29.040 --> 06:31.739
as if I shot the King,
God forbid, and I ran away.

06:31.782 --> 06:32.914
As I am a traitor.

06:34.872 --> 06:37.440
After his death,

06:37.484 --> 06:39.007
Jamal became a hero.

06:40.443 --> 06:45.143
We cry when we hear
that the hero is killed.

06:45.187 --> 06:47.494
But his works,

06:47.537 --> 06:51.193
his cause, his vision,

06:51.236 --> 06:52.847
it would live forever.

06:54.718 --> 06:57.504
What do you know
about the bees?

09:25.565 --> 09:27.523
We know from here that

09:27.567 --> 09:30.395
he entered this embassy
and didn't come out.

09:30.439 --> 09:33.529
...in Istanbul, seekingpaperwork to marry his fiancée.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.488
His fiancée saw him
go in at 1:00 p.m.

09:36.532 --> 09:39.796
and was still waiting
for him after 1:00 a.m.

10:17.834 --> 10:19.967
MALE REPORTER 1 :
Saudi officials
have denied that

10:20.010 --> 10:22.839
a prominent Saudi journalist
is in their custody.

10:22.883 --> 10:25.537
Jamal Khashoggi has
reportedly been missing

10:25.581 --> 10:27.235
for more than 24 hours.

10:27.278 --> 10:29.324
Turkey says that
they will be cooperating

10:29.367 --> 10:32.240
with Saudi authorities
to resolve the incident.

10:32.283 --> 10:34.808
The consulate said
it had no comment

10:34.851 --> 10:37.724
when asked why
he never came out.

10:40.117 --> 10:42.467
Can you tell me what
happened to Mr. Khashoggi?

10:42.511 --> 10:44.208
What happened
to Mr. Khashoggi?

10:45.993 --> 10:47.385
Did you talk to him?

10:55.785 --> 10:56.873
Okay.

10:58.875 --> 11:00.181
Jamal--

11:00.224 --> 11:01.791
Jamal Khashoggi.

11:01.835 --> 11:04.228
Jamal Ahmad Khashoggi.

11:09.973 --> 11:11.583
Right. Okay.

12:07.204 --> 12:09.163
What year was that,
Jamal, that you graduated?

12:09.206 --> 12:11.513
-Eighty-one. Yes.
-Nineteen eighty-one?

12:11.556 --> 12:14.037
Business Administration degree from Indiana State.

12:14.081 --> 12:17.301
But since then, I'm happy
to see from his biography,

12:17.345 --> 12:20.217
Jamal is a rara avis,
at least in our society,

12:20.261 --> 12:23.090
full-time long-term
professional journalist.

12:23.133 --> 12:25.657
He doesn't seem tempted
to be doing anything else.

12:45.982 --> 12:47.549
Saudi Arabia is a monarchy.

12:47.592 --> 12:50.160
I mean, the king has ruled
that it should happen.

14:52.195 --> 14:54.545
-On Twitter?
-On Twitter.

14:57.026 --> 14:59.202
I was criticizing everything

14:59.246 --> 15:01.683
except the royal family.

15:04.729 --> 15:07.384
But I didn't have
a very huge audience.

15:07.428 --> 15:10.387
I was just a regular guy
with hundred followers.

17:02.325 --> 17:04.284
The Saudi King's jet carries

17:04.327 --> 17:06.068
its own royal staircase.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.505
Waiting at the bottom of it at Gatwick Airport this morning

17:08.549 --> 17:10.333
were the Prince
and Princess of Wales.

17:10.377 --> 17:13.510
The king of one
of the most closed
societies in the world

17:13.554 --> 17:16.078
looking at ease
in this more open one.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.775
The Saudi government
and the monarchy

17:17.819 --> 17:21.649
has evolved significantly
over the last 80 years,

17:21.692 --> 17:24.043
basically,
since the kingdom was founded.

17:27.263 --> 17:29.222
The founder of Saudi Arabia,
King Abdulaziz,

17:29.265 --> 17:31.485
had about 37 sons or so.

17:31.528 --> 17:33.965
And political power,
as well as economic power,

17:34.009 --> 17:36.185
was distributed
among those sons.

17:36.229 --> 17:39.319
A pivotal country
saw a lavish welcome

17:39.362 --> 17:40.842
for the man who controls

17:40.885 --> 17:43.323
nearly half the world's
oil reserves.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.935
Once King Abdulaziz died,

17:46.978 --> 17:48.241
the crown was passed through

17:48.284 --> 17:49.633
to his son,

17:49.677 --> 17:52.027
to his son, to his son.

17:53.202 --> 17:55.248
King Salman became the king

17:55.291 --> 17:57.989
and the game
has completely changed.

18:00.601 --> 18:02.429
A new king
reigns in a country

18:02.472 --> 18:04.300
with enormous sway
over the world economy

18:04.344 --> 18:06.389
and the war on terror.

18:07.999 --> 18:10.567
While in the past, the king really had to rely on

18:10.611 --> 18:14.876
a lot of his brothers in order to govern the kingdom.

18:14.919 --> 18:16.921
When they passed
from the scene,

18:16.965 --> 18:18.662
more and more powers
concentrated

18:18.706 --> 18:22.449
in the hands of his heirs,

18:22.492 --> 18:24.364
and that's the situation
we have today.

18:39.640 --> 18:41.598
Saudi Arabia has granted

18:41.642 --> 18:45.167
Turkish investigators permission to enter and search.

22:02.233 --> 22:04.061
This is history.

22:04.105 --> 22:06.934
Protesters forcing change earlier this year in Tunisia,

22:06.977 --> 22:09.371
now succeeding
in forcing change in Egypt

22:09.415 --> 22:12.679
after nearly 30 years
of Mubarak rule.

22:14.158 --> 22:17.205
That's two Arab leaders
in two months.

22:28.259 --> 22:29.826
Arab governments are watching closely,

22:29.870 --> 22:31.872
wary that a revolution
might be headed

22:31.915 --> 22:33.569
to their country next.

22:57.941 --> 23:00.379
The military's crackdown
on opposition in Egypt

23:00.422 --> 23:04.034
had resulted in over
14,000 people thrown in jail.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.203
John, good morning.

24:26.247 --> 24:27.727
I'm on a new phone.

24:27.770 --> 24:29.555
Uh, this is temporary.

24:29.598 --> 24:34.995
Let's not exchange sensitive
information until you arrive.

24:35.038 --> 24:37.563
But this is how to get
in touch with me until then.

24:40.348 --> 24:42.959
I tell people
that Jamal and I

24:43.003 --> 24:46.180
were not supposed
to be friends.

24:46.223 --> 24:49.052
I mean, I'm a pretty
well-known dissident.

24:49.096 --> 24:53.970
But in 2012, he started
following me on Twitter.

24:54.014 --> 24:56.190
He was very interested
in social media

24:56.233 --> 24:57.931
in terms of the phenomena.

24:59.889 --> 25:03.719
Saudi Arabia has
an unprecedented
online population.

25:07.070 --> 25:09.551
We know that
there's no free speech.

25:09.595 --> 25:12.641
So, Twitter became
the parliament of the Arabs.

25:42.671 --> 25:44.586
...already proposed a series

25:44.630 --> 25:46.022
of economic and social changes

25:46.066 --> 25:49.373
under the banner
of Saudi Vision 2030.

25:49.417 --> 25:52.028
The highly anticipated
2030 Vision

25:52.072 --> 25:55.379
seems to radically change
the image of the Kingdom.

25:55.423 --> 25:57.077
The man behind it all,

25:57.120 --> 25:59.514
Crown Prince
Mohammed bin Salman,

25:59.558 --> 26:01.995
is regarded
as a progressive leader,

26:02.038 --> 26:04.824
touting social
and economic reforms.

26:10.438 --> 26:12.092
And critics say, MBS,

26:12.135 --> 26:15.182
as he's known,
is also power hungry.

26:15.225 --> 26:16.923
I had met Mohammed Salman

26:16.966 --> 26:19.665
when he was Chief of Staff
to his father.

26:21.014 --> 26:24.452
We understood
that he was very ambitious,

26:24.495 --> 26:28.412
a very impatient,
and a favorite son.

26:29.805 --> 26:31.764
He pushed aside
King Salman's half-brother,

26:31.807 --> 26:35.768
Prince Muqrin and the Crown
Prince, Muhammad Nayef.

26:35.811 --> 26:39.336
He's being described as the power behind the throne,

26:39.380 --> 26:42.383
and has had a hand in nearly
everything in the Kingdom.

26:42.426 --> 26:44.385
He is emancipating women,

26:44.428 --> 26:46.213
introducing music and cinema,

26:46.256 --> 26:48.432
and cracking down
on corruption.

27:17.244 --> 27:18.680
This is an American first,

27:18.724 --> 27:20.464
never before has a president
set foot

27:20.508 --> 27:23.685
on Saudi soil
for his first trip abroad.

27:32.738 --> 27:37.438
America will not seek to impose
our way of life on others,

27:37.481 --> 27:40.093
but to outstretch our hands

27:40.136 --> 27:43.705
in the spirit
of cooperation and trust.

27:43.749 --> 27:45.359
What my sources told me

27:45.402 --> 27:47.840
was the Saudis and Mohammed
bin Salman, in particular,

27:47.883 --> 27:49.319
were trying to forge
a relationship

27:49.363 --> 27:51.147
with people
in The White House,

27:51.191 --> 27:54.107
and most particularly
with Jared Kushner,

27:54.150 --> 27:56.457
who's the President's
son-in-law and Senior Advisor.

28:07.555 --> 28:09.731
Three billion dollars,

28:09.775 --> 28:12.603
$533 million,

28:12.647 --> 28:15.694
$525 million.

28:15.737 --> 28:17.130
That's peanuts for you.

28:17.173 --> 28:19.175
You should've increased it.
Eight hundred...

28:26.487 --> 28:29.533
He said that he's milking
the country.

28:37.672 --> 28:39.718
I'm sure
Saudi Arabian officials

28:39.761 --> 28:40.980
were caught off-guard

28:41.023 --> 28:43.460
by the election
of Mr. Trump. Now...

28:43.504 --> 28:47.160
I think all of us, as Saudis,
should worry about it.

28:47.203 --> 28:51.468
I strongly believe that
the struggle for democracy

28:51.512 --> 28:54.645
in the Middle East
are the core of all problems.

29:16.972 --> 29:19.105
When Jamal heard
that statement,

29:19.148 --> 29:20.584
he was shocked.

29:24.066 --> 29:25.372
By 2017,

29:25.415 --> 29:28.897
Jamal had an enormous audience.

29:28.941 --> 29:34.250
MBS put together a plan
to control the public sphere.

29:34.294 --> 29:37.819
Saud al-Qahtani,
MBS's right-hand man,

29:37.863 --> 29:40.082
managed
to implement this plan...

29:41.780 --> 29:43.825
...creating Twitter army
of trolls

29:43.869 --> 29:46.959
to control
the freedom of speech.

29:47.002 --> 29:48.612
Al-Qahtani worked behind the scenes

29:48.656 --> 29:50.571
as an enforcer
for the Crown Prince.

29:50.614 --> 29:52.225
Qahtani was known
for targeting those

29:52.268 --> 29:55.445
who spoke out
against Riyadh on Twitter.

30:48.803 --> 30:50.239
They're not dissidents.

30:50.283 --> 30:53.852
The people were
not even being dissidents.

30:53.895 --> 30:55.766
These were the thought-makers,

30:55.810 --> 30:59.727
the opinion-makers
of Saudi society.

30:59.770 --> 31:01.642
Writers and intellectuals.

34:37.466 --> 34:39.642
For the first time,
we are now hearing

34:39.686 --> 34:42.819
from the fiancée of WashingtonPost reporter Jamal Khashoggi...

34:42.863 --> 34:44.125
...has called on U.S. lawmakers

34:44.169 --> 34:46.127
to hold
Saudi Arabia accountable.

34:46.171 --> 34:47.868
His fiancée says
she'll fight to ensure

34:47.911 --> 34:49.957
everyone who is responsible
for his death

34:50.000 --> 34:52.002
is brought to justice.

35:05.929 --> 35:07.453
Yeah. I need 10 minutes.

35:07.496 --> 35:08.454
Yes.

35:11.283 --> 35:12.762
We need
to cross the opening...

35:12.806 --> 35:14.329
Absolutely. But let's go...

35:27.516 --> 35:30.519
If we can just announce
the press briefing.

35:30.563 --> 35:32.478
And is there any questions?

35:32.521 --> 35:34.306
If there's questions,
we cannot...

39:12.437 --> 39:14.439
I said,
"But here's the thing.

39:14.482 --> 39:16.832
Not every single one
of them trusts you."

39:18.878 --> 39:21.837
You are saying that
Jamal might be a spy.

39:26.189 --> 39:28.409
I met Jamal in Washington

39:28.453 --> 39:32.021
after a manor
connected me to him.

39:32.065 --> 39:34.459
I think we bonded a lot
over food. Heh.

39:34.502 --> 39:39.246
Like most, I guess,
Middle Easterners.

39:39.289 --> 39:41.988
He told me that
he had moved to the U.S.

39:42.031 --> 39:44.207
and that he was all alone

39:44.251 --> 39:45.687
and didn't know
what was happening

39:45.731 --> 39:48.864
for the first time
in his life at age 60.

39:48.908 --> 39:51.389
I remember
he started tearing up,

39:51.432 --> 39:57.003
telling me how his wife whom
he had loved very, very much,

39:57.046 --> 39:58.613
she wasn't okay with it.

39:58.657 --> 39:59.788
She-- Nobody was.

39:59.832 --> 40:01.094
His kids weren't okay with it.

40:01.137 --> 40:02.400
Nobody was okay with it.

40:03.618 --> 40:06.360
Everything was left behind

40:06.404 --> 40:10.669
and the country--
60 years of his life--

40:10.712 --> 40:12.018
everything.

40:12.061 --> 40:15.413
He struggled with it
every single day.

40:17.197 --> 40:21.027
In Saudi Arabia,
he was the biggest insider.

40:21.070 --> 40:23.072
And then, all of a sudden,
he finds himself

40:23.116 --> 40:24.378
on the outside,

40:24.422 --> 40:26.336
on the very much outside.

40:31.864 --> 40:34.257
I felt, like, for him
to settle emotionally,

40:34.301 --> 40:38.392
mentally, physically,
he needed to write again.

41:21.304 --> 41:23.219
I was a friend
of Jamal Khashoggi's

41:23.263 --> 41:25.483
for about 15 years.

41:25.526 --> 41:30.096
When he came toThe Washington
Post, he was transported.

41:30.139 --> 41:31.880
This was something
that he had dreamed about.

41:31.924 --> 41:33.360
You have to understand
what it's like

41:33.403 --> 41:34.579
to be a journalist
in Saudi Arabia.

41:34.622 --> 41:36.102
Every time
you try to say something

41:36.145 --> 41:38.408
that's tough-minded,
you get fired.

41:41.281 --> 41:44.937
He was the sort of person that just couldn't take a pass.

41:44.980 --> 41:48.418
If he felt something, he just insisted on writing it.

41:50.116 --> 41:51.465
I watched him get fired

41:51.509 --> 41:54.337
from a series of jobs
in Saudi Arabia,

41:54.381 --> 41:57.515
each time because
he just couldn't stop himself

41:57.558 --> 41:59.517
from saying
what he thought was true.

43:29.476 --> 43:31.434
All we want from you this time

43:31.478 --> 43:34.046
is to like and subscribe.

44:08.428 --> 44:11.649
We're seeing a truly historic
upheaval unfold right now.

44:11.692 --> 44:14.086
A royal purge in Saudi Arabia.

44:15.783 --> 44:17.306
King Salman
ordered the creation

44:17.350 --> 44:19.439
of a new
anti-corruption committee

44:19.482 --> 44:22.964
headed by son,
Prince Mohammed Salman.

44:23.008 --> 44:25.271
November of 2017,

44:25.314 --> 44:27.447
Mohammed Bin Salman
basically rounds up

44:27.490 --> 44:29.884
the most powerful people
in Saudi Arabia,

44:29.928 --> 44:32.539
puts them
in the Ritz in Riyadh,

44:32.582 --> 44:34.367
basically a five-star prison,

44:34.410 --> 44:37.283
and shakes them down
for a lot of money,

44:37.326 --> 44:39.285
over a $100 billion.

44:39.328 --> 44:41.896
Mohammed Bin Salman
ordered the arrest

44:41.940 --> 44:45.030
of powerful princes,
ministers, and investors.

44:45.073 --> 44:48.686
Some are his rivals
in the royal family.

45:02.787 --> 45:05.659
Is this also about
sending a message that,

45:05.703 --> 45:09.010
as we say in America,
there's a new sheriff in town?

45:38.823 --> 45:41.564
Jamal was starting
to realize that

45:41.608 --> 45:44.698
there's little
he can do for his country

45:44.742 --> 45:46.744
from his position
other than to write.

45:52.706 --> 45:54.882
Jamal Khashoggi
was kind of a black box

45:54.926 --> 45:57.493
of the ruling elites
in Saudi Arabia.

46:11.072 --> 46:14.423
It is easy to sit
and say we need,

46:14.467 --> 46:15.990
particularly in front
of American audience,

46:16.034 --> 46:17.383
we need more freedom,
we need more--

46:17.426 --> 46:18.601
these are golden things.

46:18.645 --> 46:19.951
Everybody loves them.

46:19.994 --> 46:21.039
--You have to be practical.

46:21.082 --> 46:22.649
I'm not asking
for democracy,

46:22.692 --> 46:25.217
I'm asking for people
to be allowed to speak.

46:25.260 --> 46:27.872
This is--
I'm asking for the minimum.

55:59.878 --> 56:02.228
In summer 2018,

56:02.271 --> 56:04.535
they were attacking him
basically every single day,

56:04.578 --> 56:07.364
threatening him,
trying to silence him.

56:09.714 --> 56:12.847
So Jamal felt the whole country was against him.

56:14.545 --> 56:16.111
And that was hurting him.

56:18.375 --> 56:19.985
He said, "Sometimes,
I feel a lot like

56:20.028 --> 56:21.813
"I don't wanna talk
about anything.

56:21.856 --> 56:23.858
I don't wanna expose
my opinions."

56:24.816 --> 56:26.426
I said, "No, no, no.

56:26.470 --> 56:30.256
You're just a victim
of what we call the Flies."

56:34.826 --> 56:37.829
The government hired
thousands of people.

56:40.266 --> 56:43.530
Every one of them using
10, 20 accounts.

56:51.495 --> 56:54.498
The moment they think critic
of the government has posted,

56:54.541 --> 56:56.978
the flies swarmed,

56:57.022 --> 57:00.025
attacking with hundreds
of negative replies.

57:01.418 --> 57:03.463
Within minutes,
the tweet is covered

57:03.507 --> 57:06.466
in pro-government
comments and hashtags,

57:06.510 --> 57:09.208
causing the person's voice
to be lost.

57:11.645 --> 57:14.474
Then each fly posts
pro-government articles

57:14.518 --> 57:17.999
and hashtags,
supporting MBS's vision.

57:19.827 --> 57:24.397
And all of the fly can repost
thousands of those tweets...

57:25.616 --> 57:27.356
forcing the state's
false narrative

57:27.400 --> 57:29.663
to the top of trending
inside the country.

57:31.665 --> 57:33.624
This is
the whole Twitter monster

57:33.667 --> 57:36.757
that Saud al-Qahtani created

57:36.801 --> 57:39.325
and you have the troll master
himself on the top.

58:10.965 --> 58:14.360
I could get hundreds of
volunteers from Saudi Arabia,

58:14.403 --> 58:16.754
Kuwait, Yemen,
other countries.

58:18.364 --> 58:20.888
Each armed
with two, three phones,

58:20.932 --> 58:23.064
generating hundreds
of accounts.

58:24.762 --> 58:26.546
But first
we would have to make sure

58:26.590 --> 58:29.244
that they are protected.

58:29.288 --> 58:31.420
Anyone tweeting
inside Saudi Arabia

58:31.464 --> 58:33.510
will be immediately identified

58:33.553 --> 58:36.904
since the government
owns all this other networks.

58:38.558 --> 58:40.212
So to mask their identities,

58:40.255 --> 58:42.606
we must give them American
or Canadian safeguards.

58:46.784 --> 58:48.350
To battle The Flies,

58:48.394 --> 58:51.092
we will call ourselves
The Bees Army.

58:51.136 --> 58:53.181
We would organize
the volunteers

58:53.225 --> 58:55.227
into groups of 40 or 50 bees,

58:55.270 --> 58:58.012
each reporting
to a supervising lieutenant.

58:59.927 --> 59:02.060
Once I give the command,
each lieutenant

59:02.103 --> 59:04.323
will tell their bee soldier
a specific tweet

59:04.366 --> 59:05.890
or hashtag to protect.

59:07.631 --> 59:10.242
But we're not going to use
the same method.

59:19.817 --> 59:21.383
Give them the freedom

59:21.427 --> 59:23.255
to say whatever they want.

59:26.214 --> 59:28.303
The Flies will,
of course, attack.

59:32.873 --> 59:34.962
But if our numbers
are stronger,

59:35.006 --> 59:37.922
we will be able to rise above
the propaganda machine...

59:39.663 --> 59:43.710
and finally install freedom
of speech inside the Kingdom.

59:46.234 --> 59:48.497
Jamal was really happy
of the idea.

59:48.541 --> 59:51.022
He said, "Brilliant, I really like it."

1:03:36.073 --> 1:03:39.728
Focusing all our efforts
on one hashtag,

1:03:39.772 --> 1:03:42.470
#wható_doóyouó_knowóabout
ó_the óbees?

1:04:29.866 --> 1:04:31.302
So the moment he left,

1:04:31.345 --> 1:04:33.695
they called
Saud al-Qahtani's office?

1:04:57.502 --> 1:05:00.070
And that was the turning point.

1:05:00.113 --> 1:05:02.550
It started trending.

1:05:42.025 --> 1:05:45.376
Jamal was surprised,
so then he started

1:05:45.419 --> 1:05:47.204
to tweet with us,
he tweeted it.

1:05:51.469 --> 1:05:53.514
And then we did it.

1:05:53.558 --> 1:05:56.082
Number one trending
in Saudi Arabia.

1:06:03.655 --> 1:06:05.962
And suddenly...

1:06:06.005 --> 1:06:07.572
he's not answering.

1:06:11.968 --> 1:06:13.970
He's just gone, disappeared.

1:07:04.716 --> 1:07:08.676
When I heard this,
I was driving to my house.

1:07:08.720 --> 1:07:11.766
My friends calling me
continuously.

1:07:11.810 --> 1:07:13.986
Come on, Jamal Khashoggi.

1:07:14.030 --> 1:07:15.553
It's news.

1:07:15.596 --> 1:07:19.252
I called a couple
of journalists based in Istanbul

1:07:19.296 --> 1:07:23.126
like Reuters,
Al Jazeera,Washington Post.

1:07:25.215 --> 1:07:28.044
There's really not a playbook
for this type of situation,

1:07:28.087 --> 1:07:30.263
but we did know that
we needed to act quickly.

1:07:30.307 --> 1:07:33.571
Within hours, we had
a letter dispatched
through the ambassador

1:07:33.614 --> 1:07:38.010
and through the United States government to the Crown Prince.

1:07:48.542 --> 1:07:51.328
I'd ask to meet with
the Saudi ambassador of the U.S.

1:07:51.371 --> 1:07:53.286
who happens to be the brother
of the Crown Prince.

1:07:53.330 --> 1:07:56.376
First response was that
he was looking into the matter.

1:08:40.812 --> 1:08:44.946
First day, there was
10 or 12 journalists

1:08:44.990 --> 1:08:46.296
waiting outside.

1:08:46.339 --> 1:08:48.254
The day after, hundreds.

1:08:50.169 --> 1:08:51.692
He entered this embassy...

1:08:51.736 --> 1:08:55.000
Two days later, 200.

1:08:55.043 --> 1:08:57.785
We demand his immediate release
if alive.

1:09:52.840 --> 1:09:54.364
I am concerned about it.

1:09:54.407 --> 1:09:55.930
I don't like hearing about it.

1:09:55.974 --> 1:09:58.890
And hopefully,
that will sort itself out.

1:09:58.933 --> 1:10:01.414
Right now, nobody knows
anything about it,

1:10:01.458 --> 1:10:03.895
but there's somepretty bad stories going around.

1:10:03.938 --> 1:10:06.158
I do not like it.
Thank you. I'll see you.

1:10:06.202 --> 1:10:08.029
I'll see you at 10:00.

1:10:28.398 --> 1:10:30.226
I will not let you down

1:10:30.269 --> 1:10:34.230
and I will not stop
defending you.

1:10:34.273 --> 1:10:35.883
Always be well.

1:11:14.226 --> 1:11:16.489
To breaking news now,
we are getting reports

1:11:16.533 --> 1:11:18.317
that Turkish authorities
believe that

1:11:18.361 --> 1:11:19.536
prominent Saudi journalist

1:11:19.579 --> 1:11:21.364
Jamal Khashoggi
has been killed.

1:11:21.407 --> 1:11:23.191
-Jamal Khashoggi--
-Jamal Khashoggi--

1:11:25.846 --> 1:11:27.544
We heard
one lie after another

1:11:27.587 --> 1:11:29.459
from the Saudi government.

1:11:29.502 --> 1:11:31.591
Saudi Arabia has denied angrily

1:11:31.635 --> 1:11:34.028
that it abducted, harmed,
or killed Khashoggi.

1:11:34.072 --> 1:11:36.030
Now suddenly,
the country is admitting

1:11:36.074 --> 1:11:38.642
that Khashoggi did die
inside that building.

1:11:38.685 --> 1:11:42.341
We heard that
he suffocated accidentally.

1:11:42.385 --> 1:11:44.256
We heard that there was
a drug administered

1:11:44.300 --> 1:11:45.866
that had an unintended effect.

1:11:45.910 --> 1:11:48.913
The government now says
he died in a fist fight.

1:12:05.886 --> 1:12:09.455
A Saudi agent was captured
on surveillance cameras

1:12:09.499 --> 1:12:13.546
in Istanbul
wearing Khashoggi's clothes.

1:12:50.888 --> 1:12:53.020
The Washington Post
has just posted

1:12:53.064 --> 1:12:55.893
the last piece
Jamal Khashoggi wrote,

1:12:55.936 --> 1:12:57.895
filed shortly
before he was seen

1:12:57.938 --> 1:13:01.507
entering that Saudi consulate
in Turkey.

1:13:01.551 --> 1:13:04.380
Tonight, there are still
many unanswered questions

1:13:04.423 --> 1:13:05.729
in his disappearance.

1:13:05.772 --> 1:13:07.905
Earlier today,
Turkish investigators

1:13:07.948 --> 1:13:09.602
search the residence of...

1:13:40.981 --> 1:13:42.505
This one.

1:17:44.050 --> 1:17:47.010
The court
has issued arrest warrants

1:17:47.053 --> 1:17:48.838
for two additional suspects

1:17:48.881 --> 1:17:50.927
in the killing
of Jamal Khashoggi.

1:17:50.970 --> 1:17:54.757
Ahmed al-Asiri
was the country's
Deputy Intelligence Chief

1:17:54.800 --> 1:17:58.630
and high-ranking adviser
to the Crown Prince.

1:17:58.674 --> 1:18:01.851
Saud al-Qahtani
was a Royal Court Adviser

1:18:01.894 --> 1:18:04.810
and key counselor to Crown
Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

1:18:39.366 --> 1:18:41.412
The chief prosecutor
who's been holding

1:18:41.455 --> 1:18:44.763
a joint investigation with his Saudi counterpart this week

1:18:44.807 --> 1:18:47.200
issued a statement
following their talks.

1:18:47.244 --> 1:18:50.638
He says discussions yielded
no concrete results,

1:18:50.682 --> 1:18:55.643
despite Turkey's intentions
to reveal the truth.

1:19:06.480 --> 1:19:08.918
Sir, can you say anything
from the investigation?

1:19:08.961 --> 1:19:10.963
Where is Khashoggi's body?

1:19:54.790 --> 1:19:56.661
My name is John Scott-Railton.

1:19:56.704 --> 1:19:59.795
I'm a senior researcher
at a place called
The Citizen Lab.

1:20:02.885 --> 1:20:06.976
It's this group of
researchers and investigators

1:20:07.019 --> 1:20:08.629
that try to understand

1:20:08.673 --> 1:20:09.805
the digital things

1:20:09.848 --> 1:20:12.068
that are targeting
civil society,

1:20:12.111 --> 1:20:16.028
so journalists,
activists, everybody really,

1:20:16.072 --> 1:20:19.902
who's part of what constitutes
a flourishing democracy.

1:20:23.079 --> 1:20:26.299
It's almost a miracle
that we found Omar.

1:20:26.343 --> 1:20:27.953
It's a miracle that
he survived this long.

1:20:30.521 --> 1:20:34.394
There's sort of a growing
global market for spyware.

1:20:34.438 --> 1:20:37.484
Governments want to listen
to encrypted phone calls.

1:20:37.528 --> 1:20:39.095
They wanna read
your WhatsApp chats,

1:20:39.138 --> 1:20:41.575
your Signal chats,
and they can't do it

1:20:41.619 --> 1:20:43.490
as that chat
goes across their network.

1:20:43.534 --> 1:20:46.058
So, their solution to this is,
let's hack the phone.

1:20:46.102 --> 1:20:48.713
Was the CIA aware

1:20:48.756 --> 1:20:51.672
that the Saudis had purchased
spyware from Israel?

1:20:51.716 --> 1:20:53.544
I'm not going
to confirm or deny.

1:20:53.587 --> 1:20:55.981
That's either--
We're aware of certain things.

1:20:56.025 --> 1:20:58.984
All's I will say is that
the Saudi services

1:20:59.028 --> 1:21:01.944
are able to have insight
into what their citizens

1:21:01.987 --> 1:21:05.425
or what even non-Saudi citizens
were doing

1:21:05.469 --> 1:21:06.862
inside the Kingdom
and outside.

1:21:08.646 --> 1:21:10.387
Saudi Arabia is definitely

1:21:10.430 --> 1:21:12.955
a major player in the space.

1:21:12.998 --> 1:21:16.567
Throughout my entire career,
I focused on the top four--

1:21:16.610 --> 1:21:19.875
Russia, China,
Iran, North Korea.

1:21:19.918 --> 1:21:21.833
And I think it's safe to say
that Saudi Arabia

1:21:21.877 --> 1:21:24.618
has comparable skills
and abilities

1:21:24.662 --> 1:21:27.752
to conduct cyber operations.

1:21:27.795 --> 1:21:29.536
I think it's important
for people to understand

1:21:29.580 --> 1:21:32.496
how easy it is
to access these tools.

1:21:38.371 --> 1:21:42.071
Thanks to an Israeli company called NSO,

1:21:42.114 --> 1:21:45.639
the Saudis have
the best hacking technology

1:21:45.683 --> 1:21:47.119
that money can buy.

1:21:48.686 --> 1:21:50.688
Pegasus Version Two.

1:21:54.648 --> 1:21:57.521
Pegasus is a piece of software,

1:21:57.564 --> 1:21:59.871
but it's also a capability,

1:21:59.915 --> 1:22:02.656
it's the capability
to infect a phone

1:22:02.700 --> 1:22:05.007
and turn it into a digital spy

1:22:05.050 --> 1:22:07.357
in the pocket of the victim--

1:22:07.400 --> 1:22:10.969
siphoning off private
and encrypted chats,

1:22:11.013 --> 1:22:12.840
photographs, messages,

1:22:12.884 --> 1:22:15.452
even enabling the microphone
and the camera,

1:22:15.495 --> 1:22:18.150
turn that phone
into a bug in a room.

1:22:19.891 --> 1:22:21.849
They sent a malicious link.

1:22:21.893 --> 1:22:24.026
The link looks legit, you know, it looks like, for example,

1:22:24.069 --> 1:22:26.028
you know, boarding pass,

1:22:26.071 --> 1:22:29.770
you click on it and it actually goes where it's supposed to go,

1:22:29.814 --> 1:22:31.598
but in between,
it's downloading something

1:22:31.642 --> 1:22:33.731
into your device.

1:22:33.774 --> 1:22:36.560
Once it compromises
mobile devices,

1:22:36.603 --> 1:22:38.431
the end user
of the Pegasus tool

1:22:38.475 --> 1:22:41.391
has unfettered access
to that device.

1:22:44.046 --> 1:22:47.963
Think of your phone today,
the people you talk to,

1:22:48.006 --> 1:22:50.748
the photos you take,
the places you go,

1:22:50.791 --> 1:22:53.577
the things that you say around and into your phone, right?

1:22:53.620 --> 1:22:56.797
This is a huge slice
of your life.

1:22:56.841 --> 1:22:59.800
And that stuff
is tremendously valuable

1:22:59.844 --> 1:23:01.933
to somebody who wants
to monitor you,

1:23:01.977 --> 1:23:03.195
who wants to figure out
what you're doing

1:23:03.239 --> 1:23:04.631
and maybe who wants to subvert

1:23:04.675 --> 1:23:07.286
your political activity.

1:23:07.330 --> 1:23:11.421
Once Pegasus takes control
of a phone, it's game over.

1:23:30.048 --> 1:23:32.703
To share information, an infected device

1:23:32.746 --> 1:23:36.576
is gonna be talking to
the servers that control it.

1:23:36.620 --> 1:23:39.492
It has to phone home.

1:23:39.536 --> 1:23:42.104
And so we had developed
a technique

1:23:42.147 --> 1:23:46.630
to see what networks
might have infected devices.

1:23:47.979 --> 1:23:49.285
So, what we found in Montreal

1:23:49.328 --> 1:23:50.895
in December 2018

1:23:50.938 --> 1:23:53.289
is that there appeared
to be a device

1:23:53.332 --> 1:23:55.465
in the University Network
phoning home

1:23:55.508 --> 1:23:57.771
to a cluster of servers
that belonged

1:23:57.815 --> 1:24:00.339
to Saudi Arabia's
Pegasus deployment.

1:24:34.069 --> 1:24:36.897
So, we go to Montreal, we sit with Omar

1:24:36.941 --> 1:24:41.032
and actually find
the message on Omar's phone

1:24:41.076 --> 1:24:43.426
that we believe led
to that infection.

1:24:43.469 --> 1:24:46.646
It looks like a DHL
shipping tracking notification.

1:24:46.690 --> 1:24:48.561
Only it isn't.

1:28:58.245 --> 1:29:01.597
Are you being allowed in?
Are the Saudis allowing you in?

1:29:18.527 --> 1:29:21.138
Some of the tape
recordings we've heard

1:29:21.181 --> 1:29:22.835
preceded the killing.

1:29:41.071 --> 1:29:42.768
"Joints will be separated.

1:29:42.812 --> 1:29:44.640
"It's not a problem.

1:30:56.973 --> 1:30:59.497
The conversation turns to,

1:30:59.541 --> 1:31:02.457
"Will you come back
to Saudi Arabia?"

1:31:40.320 --> 1:31:44.455
The fear is escalating
in his voice.

1:31:54.596 --> 1:31:56.685
Then we hear a struggle.

1:32:34.723 --> 1:32:36.812
You can hear the other people

1:33:05.405 --> 1:33:10.193
The most difficult part
of those recordings

1:33:44.706 --> 1:33:48.231
I was thinking, when
he entered his consulate...

1:35:14.099 --> 1:35:16.754
The king firmly denied
any knowledge of it.

1:35:16.798 --> 1:35:18.669
I don't wanna get
into his mind.

1:35:18.713 --> 1:35:20.540
But it sounded to me like

1:35:20.584 --> 1:35:24.283
maybe these could have been
rogue killers. Who knows?

1:35:27.243 --> 1:35:29.462
World leaders are
gathering in Saudi Arabia

1:35:29.506 --> 1:35:32.683
for a summit commonly known
as "Davos in the desert."

1:35:32.727 --> 1:35:34.772
A couple weeks
after the murder,

1:35:34.816 --> 1:35:37.732
there was a big, important
conference for Saudi Arabia.

1:35:37.775 --> 1:35:41.605
Davos in the desert is supposed to promote Saudi Crown Prince,

1:35:41.648 --> 1:35:45.217
Mohammed bin Salman's reform vision for the Kingdom.

1:35:45.261 --> 1:35:48.525
Davos in the desert is the make or break part of Vision 2030.

1:35:50.135 --> 1:35:53.748
But it ended up being
a fiasco for MBS.

1:35:59.492 --> 1:36:03.496
The Jamal story

1:36:03.540 --> 1:36:05.542
galvanized public attention

1:36:05.585 --> 1:36:08.153
in the United States,
around the world.

1:36:11.766 --> 1:36:16.205
It may destroy MBS' hopes
for modernizing the Kingdom

1:36:16.248 --> 1:36:18.163
because he needs investors,

1:36:18.207 --> 1:36:20.470
he needs people who invest
in the Kingdom.

1:36:20.513 --> 1:36:23.560
And right now,
he has become toxic.

1:36:25.605 --> 1:36:27.607
As pressure on Saudi mounts,

1:36:27.651 --> 1:36:30.785
several U.S. media organizationsand business leaders

1:36:30.828 --> 1:36:34.745
have pulled out of
a major investment
conference in Riyadh.

1:36:34.789 --> 1:36:36.312
The conference happens,

1:36:36.355 --> 1:36:39.054
all those important guests
eventually don't go.

1:36:39.097 --> 1:36:43.623
Jeff Bezos was supposed
to be a secret guest.

1:36:43.667 --> 1:36:47.453
Bezos is someone with a direct relationship with MBS.

1:36:47.497 --> 1:36:50.543
They messaged each other.

1:36:50.587 --> 1:36:52.328
They talked about business.
They talked about, you know,

1:36:52.371 --> 1:36:55.374
all the great things
they're gonna do together.

1:36:55.418 --> 1:36:56.767
And he was supposed to declare

1:36:56.811 --> 1:37:00.727
this enormous deal
at this conference.

1:37:00.771 --> 1:37:02.164
But after the murder,

1:37:02.207 --> 1:37:06.168
Bezos just stopped
all contact with MBS.

1:37:06.211 --> 1:37:07.734
Bezos owns
The Washington Post,

1:37:07.778 --> 1:37:10.563
which means that
Jamal worked for him.

1:37:10.607 --> 1:37:15.090
It seemed that MBS expected
Bezos to say, "You know what?

1:37:15.133 --> 1:37:16.656
"I control this newspaper

1:37:16.700 --> 1:37:18.310
and I can curb them.
I can tell them,

1:37:18.354 --> 1:37:20.225
you know, don't make
a big deal about this."

1:37:20.269 --> 1:37:23.315
But when push came to shove,
Bezos did not interfere

1:37:23.359 --> 1:37:26.710
whenThe Washington Post
started a whole campaign.

1:37:26.753 --> 1:37:28.625
"Justice for Jamal".

1:37:30.061 --> 1:37:32.759
MBS saw that as betrayal.

1:37:34.152 --> 1:37:36.676
After Davos in the desert,

1:37:36.720 --> 1:37:38.069
we have evidence

1:37:38.113 --> 1:37:39.941
that Jeff Bezos' phone

1:37:39.984 --> 1:37:43.945
had been infected
with malware.

1:37:43.988 --> 1:37:47.600
And the way in which
that technology was delivered

1:37:47.644 --> 1:37:49.341
to his phone was through a text

1:37:49.385 --> 1:37:52.649
from the Crown Prince himself.

1:37:54.303 --> 1:37:56.696
I am the United Nations
Special Rapporteur

1:37:56.740 --> 1:37:59.351
on Freedom of Opinion
and Expression.

1:37:59.395 --> 1:38:03.268
The work that I've been doing
over the last 18 months or so

1:38:03.312 --> 1:38:05.618
is on the private
surveillance industry.

1:38:10.797 --> 1:38:13.757
A video was sent in 2018

1:38:13.800 --> 1:38:15.759
from MBS' WhatsApp account

1:38:15.802 --> 1:38:17.543
to Jeff Bezos' phone.

1:38:18.893 --> 1:38:21.721
Then we see
this massive increase

1:38:21.765 --> 1:38:25.334
in data leaving the phone.

1:38:25.377 --> 1:38:27.031
It was only after

1:38:27.075 --> 1:38:28.946
the killing of Jamal Khashoggi

1:38:28.990 --> 1:38:31.775
thatThe Washington Post
was an important target

1:38:31.818 --> 1:38:34.169
for Saudi Arabia.

1:38:34.212 --> 1:38:38.303
This was exactly the moment
whenThe National Enquirer

1:38:38.347 --> 1:38:40.523
was saying to Bezos,

1:38:40.566 --> 1:38:44.440
"We have evidence
connecting you to an affair."

1:38:45.745 --> 1:38:49.271
So Bezos' security team
is learning

1:38:49.314 --> 1:38:51.403
that his phone
may have been compromised.

1:38:51.447 --> 1:38:53.057
But at the same time,

1:38:53.101 --> 1:38:56.017
Bezos is getting
WhatsApp messages

1:38:56.060 --> 1:38:57.932
from MBS that are strange.

1:38:59.716 --> 1:39:01.761
Essentially,
"Whatever you're hearing

1:39:01.805 --> 1:39:05.461
about Saudi involvement
in this is not true."

1:39:05.504 --> 1:39:08.420
In order to send
those kinds of text messages,

1:39:08.464 --> 1:39:09.944
MBS has to know

1:39:09.987 --> 1:39:13.164
what Bezos is learning
about Saudi involvement.

1:39:14.949 --> 1:39:16.515
And then what we see is that

1:39:16.559 --> 1:39:19.475
there's this massive
Saudi online campaign,

1:39:19.518 --> 1:39:20.737
a Twitter campaign,

1:39:20.780 --> 1:39:22.652
against Jeff Bezos.

1:39:24.219 --> 1:39:25.698
The intention
was to humiliate

1:39:25.742 --> 1:39:28.005
and to punish Bezos.

1:39:28.049 --> 1:39:31.878
It was exactly the same thing
that they did to Jamal.

1:39:34.577 --> 1:39:37.362
That mere fact that
MBS has the reach

1:39:37.406 --> 1:39:41.584
to conduct surveillance on the richest man in the world

1:39:41.627 --> 1:39:44.021
is not only striking,
but it's scary.

1:39:46.893 --> 1:39:49.809
Earlier today, CIA Director,
Gina Haspel briefed

1:39:49.853 --> 1:39:52.638
a select group of high ranking senators on the killing

1:39:52.682 --> 1:39:55.467
ofWashington Post columnist,
Jamal Khashoggi.

1:39:55.511 --> 1:39:58.514
The CIA Director, Gina Haspel met with the Turks

1:39:58.557 --> 1:40:02.083
and said, "Show me the audio.
Let me hear it."

1:40:03.649 --> 1:40:06.435
The CIA Director's job is to present the information

1:40:06.478 --> 1:40:10.091
to a policymaker so they can
make a decision on how to act.

1:40:10.134 --> 1:40:11.918
This assessment was different.

1:40:11.962 --> 1:40:15.183
If the Crown Prince
went in front of a jury,

1:40:15.226 --> 1:40:17.576
he would be convicted
in 30 minutes.

1:40:17.620 --> 1:40:19.404
Yes.

1:40:19.448 --> 1:40:22.103
They're buying hundreds
of billions of dollars' worth

1:40:22.146 --> 1:40:23.843
of things from this country.

1:40:23.887 --> 1:40:26.542
I'm not gonna destroy
the economy for our country

1:40:26.585 --> 1:40:29.066
by being foolish
with Saudi Arabia, so...

1:40:29.110 --> 1:40:31.851
There's not a smoking gun,
there's a smoking saw.

1:40:31.895 --> 1:40:33.462
You have to be willfully blind

1:40:33.505 --> 1:40:36.856
not to come to the conclusionthat this was orchestrated

1:40:36.900 --> 1:40:42.079
and organized by people in--
under the command of MBS.

1:40:42.123 --> 1:40:43.472
Did MBS lie to you, sir?

1:40:43.515 --> 1:40:45.561
He told me thathe had nothing to do with it.

1:40:45.604 --> 1:40:48.085
-But what if he's lying?-As recently as a few days ago.

1:40:48.129 --> 1:40:50.740
Did you just live with it
because you need him?

1:40:50.783 --> 1:40:52.959
Well, will anybody
really know, all right?

1:40:53.003 --> 1:40:54.352
Will anybody really know?

1:40:54.396 --> 1:40:55.832
I have not seen,

1:40:55.875 --> 1:40:58.182
in 20 years
covering intelligence,

1:40:58.226 --> 1:41:02.186
the conclusion from the CIA
that is this confident

1:41:02.230 --> 1:41:05.276
about the role
of one person in an act.

1:41:05.320 --> 1:41:07.496
Everybody
but the President agrees

1:41:07.539 --> 1:41:09.063
that Mohammed bin Salman
ordered

1:41:09.106 --> 1:41:11.021
Jamal Khashoggi's
assassination.

1:42:39.892 --> 1:42:42.808
Nine, eight, seven...

1:43:06.136 --> 1:43:08.182
The first day they broadcast,

1:43:08.225 --> 1:43:12.447
Jamal invites Shiite dissidents on the air,

1:43:12.490 --> 1:43:16.277
who were the people
who the Bahrainian
authorities most feared.

1:45:16.397 --> 1:45:17.702
Are we so blind

1:45:17.746 --> 1:45:20.052
to the malign influence
of Saudi Arabia

1:45:20.096 --> 1:45:21.924
that we just give
money and weapons

1:45:21.967 --> 1:45:24.840
to anybody regardless
of what they do?

1:45:24.883 --> 1:45:28.365
You can cut a dissident
into pieces with a bone saw

1:45:28.409 --> 1:45:30.498
and we'll
still give you weapons?

1:47:25.874 --> 1:47:27.092
Thank you.

1:47:27.136 --> 1:47:29.530
I now give the floor
to Saudi Arabia.

1:47:32.097 --> 1:47:33.359
Thank you.

1:47:33.403 --> 1:47:35.361
Accusations have been launched

1:47:35.405 --> 1:47:38.147
and fingers have been pointed,

1:47:38.190 --> 1:47:42.760
we reject any attempt
to remove this

1:47:42.804 --> 1:47:45.459
from our national justice
system in Saudi Arabia

1:47:45.502 --> 1:47:47.330
in respect to the form
that that may take.

1:47:47.373 --> 1:47:48.810
Many thanks.

1:48:11.833 --> 1:48:14.575
Did you order
the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?

1:48:15.924 --> 1:48:17.839
Absolutely not.

1:48:17.882 --> 1:48:19.623
Some think that I should know

1:48:19.667 --> 1:48:21.146
what three million
people working

1:48:21.190 --> 1:48:23.714
for the Saudi government
do daily?

1:48:23.758 --> 1:48:25.455
Absolutely not.

1:48:29.415 --> 1:48:32.331
My name is Hatice Cengiz.

1:48:32.375 --> 1:48:34.943
I'm addressing you
as a victim,

1:48:34.986 --> 1:48:39.730
a title forced on me after
the brutal murder of my Jamal.

1:48:42.211 --> 1:48:47.216
Jamal and I would have been
husband and wife by now.

1:48:51.437 --> 1:48:55.964
The failure to punish Jamal's
murderers affects us all.

1:48:57.618 --> 1:49:02.231
But also democracy,
human rights, and freedom.

1:49:04.494 --> 1:49:09.238
Mr. Chair,
the truth always wins.

1:49:09.281 --> 1:49:11.588
History will take note.

1:49:11.632 --> 1:49:14.678
Please take action.
Thank you.

1:52:16.251 --> 1:52:19.036
Hatice, you paced that street

1:52:19.080 --> 1:52:21.822
and waiting for hours.

1:52:21.865 --> 1:52:26.391
No one should ever have
to endure what you did.

1:52:26.435 --> 1:52:28.350
We are here

1:52:28.393 --> 1:52:30.004
and you are not alone.
