02:52.464 --> 02:56.093
Draka!

02:58.721 --> 03:00.055
Where are you?

03:06.437 --> 03:07.438
Here he comes.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.856
We'll take care of the mother.

03:09.440 --> 03:10.316
You keep him out.

03:10.399 --> 03:12.067
-Come on. Push, my dear.
-Come on, push.

03:29.501 --> 03:32.504
Draka!

03:44.016 --> 03:44.850
Push.

03:52.066 --> 03:54.777
Draka!

04:21.887 --> 04:23.389
The mother is dead.

04:23.472 --> 04:25.432
The child lives.

05:28.162 --> 05:29.747
Give me my son.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.549
You can't have him.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.177
He's under our protection.

05:44.511 --> 05:47.681
It is our duty to raise him.

05:47.765 --> 05:50.768
Until he's able to make his own choices.

05:58.067 --> 05:59.443
The Dampyr lives.

07:16.520 --> 07:18.564
Someone enjoyed themselves here.

07:59.605 --> 08:02.232
Good of command to tell us
the town had been reclaimed.

08:13.869 --> 08:16.371
Now we'll have to do
the gravediggers' job.

08:37.100 --> 08:39.645
What the fuck happened to these bodies?

08:45.442 --> 08:46.818
Where is the blood?

09:40.497 --> 09:42.207
Looks like nobody was spared.

09:43.417 --> 09:44.418
Military...

09:45.335 --> 09:46.336
civilians.

09:47.838 --> 09:48.922
Did they kill each other?

09:50.007 --> 09:51.008
Don't talk shit.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.052
Someone always survives a fight.

10:03.061 --> 10:05.397
Looks like the work of wolves.

10:13.030 --> 10:13.864
It was...

10:16.450 --> 10:17.284
Easy.

10:18.577 --> 10:19.828
...the devil.

10:22.205 --> 10:24.249
It was the devil.

10:28.003 --> 10:29.671
What happened here, old man?

10:30.589 --> 10:32.841
They opened fire...

10:35.302 --> 10:38.430
-my people in the church...
-Easy.

10:38.513 --> 10:42.392
-...screams, "Blood, blood, blood."
-Easy.

10:43.101 --> 10:44.102
Who was it?

10:45.687 --> 10:46.772
Did you see them?

10:47.522 --> 10:48.648
Dampyr.

10:49.149 --> 10:52.861
You must call Dampyr.
You must call Dampyr.

10:52.944 --> 10:54.946
-Dampyr?
-You must call--

10:57.240 --> 10:59.076
Shut the fuck up.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.327
Damn it, Stefan!

11:02.788 --> 11:04.748
The fuck is the matter with you?

11:04.831 --> 11:07.209
He was just some crazy old fool.

11:12.714 --> 11:13.715
Call the others.

11:16.093 --> 11:18.512
Get all the bodies gathered in one place.

11:20.555 --> 11:22.057
We need to bury the dead.

11:25.102 --> 11:26.103
Move!

11:39.741 --> 11:40.742
Let's go.

11:40.826 --> 11:42.452
Don't miss anyone!

11:43.995 --> 11:45.247
Move them over there.

12:04.307 --> 12:05.308
Harlan.

12:06.226 --> 12:07.644
Come here to me.

12:17.195 --> 12:19.448
-Another one of your nightmares?
-Yeah.

12:19.990 --> 12:21.450
They're getting worse, Yuri.

12:28.832 --> 12:30.834
Maybe if you quit drinking that crap.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.502
You're too young to be my father.

12:32.586 --> 12:35.213
But not too young
to be your manager, Harlan.

12:36.548 --> 12:39.176
I want you in good shape.
We have a lot of work to do.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.886
I'm in perfect shape. Can't you see?

12:41.511 --> 12:42.762
Stop calling it "work."

12:42.846 --> 12:43.930
It is work.

12:44.556 --> 12:45.932
Puts food on the table.

12:47.476 --> 12:49.853
-Where are you taking me?
-Jostanira.

12:49.936 --> 12:51.730
Their cemetery is infested.

12:51.813 --> 12:53.440
Weren't we there last week?

12:53.523 --> 12:54.774
That was Jostalica.

12:55.484 --> 12:58.695
-Come on, man. Try to concentrate, please.
-Easy.

12:59.779 --> 13:00.906
I'm a professional.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.701
The Dampyr.

13:09.247 --> 13:11.791
Come closer. Please. Come closer.

13:12.334 --> 13:13.877
The Dampyr is coming.

13:19.591 --> 13:20.425
The Dampyr.

13:20.967 --> 13:22.802
Citizens of Jostanira.

13:24.346 --> 13:25.972
I know you're all worried.

13:26.598 --> 13:29.017
Evil has reached your peaceful village.

13:29.726 --> 13:32.979
And believe me when I tell you,
you are right to be afraid.

13:33.730 --> 13:37.484
The devil's stench is everywhere,
infesting this place.

13:38.652 --> 13:39.694
You are damned.

13:42.614 --> 13:45.700
You heard me, you are damned
and you already know it.

13:46.910 --> 13:49.704
But from now on, you will fear no evil.

13:50.622 --> 13:51.623
Because today...

13:52.582 --> 13:58.004
finally, here in your midst
stands the powerful...

13:58.838 --> 13:59.923
Harlan...

14:01.508 --> 14:02.634
the Dampyr.

14:03.468 --> 14:04.469
The Dampyr.

14:06.805 --> 14:08.223
Take me to the cemetery.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.101
Get back. Give him room to work.

14:15.689 --> 14:19.025
Get back. The Dampyr feels
the presence of a vampire.

14:23.613 --> 14:24.823
Get back.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.494
Out, damned soul.

14:30.161 --> 14:32.372
Return to the hell that spawned you.

14:32.455 --> 14:34.791
You don't belong in this holy place.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.510
-Margherita pizza...
-What is he saying?

14:46.219 --> 14:50.599
Esoteric formulas to seal the cemetery
and make it impossible for evil to return.

14:51.975 --> 14:54.060
God, I could use a fucking drink
right now, Yuri.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.189
Millennial knowledge.

15:07.782 --> 15:09.367
Return to your homes in peace.

15:09.451 --> 15:12.495
The monster that infected your cemetery
has been defeated.

15:26.426 --> 15:28.720
Thank you. Thank you. Thanks.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.849
Okay. Okay. Thank you. Oh, thank you.

15:33.683 --> 15:34.934
Yuri!

15:48.573 --> 15:50.575
Commander Kurjak to command.

15:52.494 --> 15:54.621
Commander Kurjak to command.

15:57.374 --> 15:58.583
Commander Kurjak.

16:04.255 --> 16:05.382
Commander Kur--

16:09.135 --> 16:10.136
Fuck it.

16:16.518 --> 16:17.519
Now what?

16:20.605 --> 16:21.606
We stay here...

16:24.818 --> 16:26.361
and maintain our position.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.180
I don't get Kurjak.

16:55.432 --> 16:57.892
What is the point
of staying in this town, huh?

16:57.976 --> 17:01.229
This ghost town will help us win the war?

17:03.106 --> 17:05.400
Since when did you become
a strategist, Petar?

17:05.483 --> 17:07.652
Hey. Isn't that what I'm here for?

17:07.736 --> 17:10.363
You're here because you have smokes.
Give me one.

17:11.156 --> 17:13.074
Maybe it will stop me
freezing my nuts off.

17:22.208 --> 17:23.417
Help!

17:27.338 --> 17:28.548
I gotta be dreaming.

17:29.466 --> 17:31.176
Oh, you're not dreaming.

17:31.259 --> 17:32.260
Help!

17:34.929 --> 17:37.932
-Help me, I'm scared.
-Sure, baby.

17:38.016 --> 17:39.434
I'll help you.

17:40.769 --> 17:41.686
Come to Daddy.

17:41.770 --> 17:44.355
Wait, Petar. You don't know
who the fuck she might be.

17:44.939 --> 17:48.651
All right.
It looks like she's dying to know me.

17:49.486 --> 17:50.487
Petar.

17:55.492 --> 17:56.493
Help.

18:10.381 --> 18:11.216
Petar.

18:13.092 --> 18:13.927
Petar.

18:16.846 --> 18:17.680
Petar!

18:25.980 --> 18:26.981
Move!

18:29.484 --> 18:30.819
Commander!

18:32.111 --> 18:33.196
Who's shooting?

18:34.155 --> 18:37.325
Came from down there where
those two idiots, Petar and Janko, are.

18:38.827 --> 18:41.538
-We're under attack!
-Move. Three with me!

18:42.455 --> 18:43.456
Move!

19:06.563 --> 19:07.564
Who's there?

19:14.988 --> 19:15.822
Tito!

19:16.406 --> 19:17.407
Tito!

19:39.596 --> 19:42.056
-Move.
-Commander. We are under attack!

19:42.140 --> 19:42.974
Commander!

19:43.850 --> 19:44.851
Who attacked us?

19:56.321 --> 19:57.447
Hey!

20:00.617 --> 20:01.993
Hold your positions!

20:03.369 --> 20:04.370
Hold!

20:04.871 --> 20:05.914
What's going on?

20:07.040 --> 20:08.041
What's going on?

20:17.842 --> 20:19.218
Son of a bitch.

20:23.431 --> 20:24.265
Commander!

20:24.349 --> 20:25.975
Commander, we need help!

20:26.059 --> 20:27.101
Come on!

20:27.727 --> 20:28.603
Cover!

20:29.812 --> 20:31.606
Get him down. Move.

20:38.196 --> 20:39.405
Who did you see, Josif?

20:40.907 --> 20:43.618
I shot him, but he didn't die.

20:44.953 --> 20:46.287
He didn't die.

20:47.956 --> 20:49.749
Josif. Josif!

20:49.832 --> 20:51.376
Don't do that.

20:53.503 --> 20:54.504
We have to call him.

20:55.838 --> 20:57.131
Come on, asshole.

20:58.007 --> 21:00.426
-The old man was right!
-Lazar.

21:00.510 --> 21:01.928
Our enemies...

21:02.720 --> 21:03.805
hellish creatures!

21:05.181 --> 21:06.182
Undead!

21:07.600 --> 21:10.812
-What is wrong with you?
-Our bullets are useless against them.

21:12.313 --> 21:14.857
We have to find the one
who know how to beat them.

21:15.858 --> 21:17.485
Who the fuck are you talking about?

21:21.489 --> 21:22.490
I know him.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.661
Let me go look for the one...

21:27.954 --> 21:29.288
who can help us.

21:42.051 --> 21:43.636
I hate it
when I have to do the whole show.

21:43.720 --> 21:44.804
We're doing nothing wrong.

21:44.887 --> 21:47.682
-You call this "doing nothing wrong"?
-The girl is already dead.

21:47.765 --> 21:48.891
She won't feel a thing.

21:49.517 --> 21:52.895
And her parents can go to sleep tonight,
knowing she won't wake up as a vampire.

21:53.563 --> 21:56.524
That, in my opinion,
is what is called "doing good."

21:56.607 --> 21:58.985
And it's all thanks to the great Dampyr.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.531
Just give me the goddamn stake.

22:09.829 --> 22:10.663
Save us.

22:10.747 --> 22:12.165
-You're our savior.
-Dampyr.

22:12.248 --> 22:13.416
Dampyr.

22:28.639 --> 22:32.185
-Get back.
-Do you have to cut off her head?

22:33.311 --> 22:35.855
She's my youngest daughter, Emina.

22:35.938 --> 22:38.524
Save her soul, Dampyr.

22:38.608 --> 22:40.651
Hey, let the Dampyr work, okay?

22:40.735 --> 22:41.736
Please!

22:44.822 --> 22:46.282
Forgive me, Emina.

22:55.750 --> 22:57.585
Oh, my God.

23:05.551 --> 23:06.844
Thanks. Thanks, but--

23:07.720 --> 23:09.514
Thanks, but please keep quiet.

23:10.306 --> 23:12.725
We are purifying the cemetery
of its evil spirits,

23:12.809 --> 23:15.061
of which there are so many
at this time of death.

23:15.144 --> 23:16.562
Thank you, thanks.

23:16.646 --> 23:17.855
Show is over, kid.

23:18.523 --> 23:19.732
You have to come with us.

23:21.609 --> 23:24.737
We're arresting this fraud on orders
from our commander.

23:25.363 --> 23:27.573
He won't be able
to fleece you suckers anymore.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.242
Stay back!

23:29.867 --> 23:30.701
Stay back!

23:31.953 --> 23:32.954
Stay back!

23:34.413 --> 23:36.582
If you arrest him,
then you have to arrest me too.

23:36.666 --> 23:37.708
Beat it, kid!

23:38.626 --> 23:41.712
-Down, boy.
-Not going anywhere without my manager!

23:56.018 --> 23:58.729
I didn't recognize you.
Otherwise, I would have hit you harder.

23:58.813 --> 24:01.107
You haven't changed a bit
since the day we met.

24:01.190 --> 24:03.151
The advantages of living a healthy life.

24:03.901 --> 24:07.029
You, on the other hand, look like shit.
The war does not agree with you.

24:07.113 --> 24:09.407
You can't arrest us
for giving people hope.

24:09.490 --> 24:11.742
"Hope." Too bad for those stupid fucks.

24:12.785 --> 24:14.036
And we're not arresting you.

24:14.579 --> 24:16.247
Our commander wants to talk to you.

24:16.789 --> 24:17.832
Talk to us?

24:18.416 --> 24:22.086
-What? Two useless, meaningless bums?
-Yeah, you're right, kid.

24:23.212 --> 24:25.506
The truth is,
it's Harlan he wants to talk to.

24:25.590 --> 24:27.258
What the fuck am I gonna tell him?

24:28.342 --> 24:29.844
What's really going on here, Lazar?

25:02.418 --> 25:03.252
Move.

25:07.131 --> 25:08.132
Let's go.

25:10.760 --> 25:11.594
Open up!

25:13.054 --> 25:14.430
Hey, I'm his manager.

25:15.514 --> 25:16.349
Butt out, kid.

25:24.649 --> 25:25.983
Here he is, commander.

25:38.788 --> 25:39.622
Well?

25:42.416 --> 25:46.212
"Well," what?
You're the ones that brought me here.

25:47.004 --> 25:49.006
I was better off
not seeing your ugly faces.

25:50.174 --> 25:52.260
Show Commander Kurjak some respect.

25:54.512 --> 25:55.930
Yes, sir, colonel.

25:56.430 --> 25:58.432
Private Harlan reporting for duty.

26:02.728 --> 26:03.562
No?

26:05.690 --> 26:08.776
If we've finished with the introductions,
can someone tell me what I'm doing here?

26:09.652 --> 26:11.279
I got nothing to do with this war.

26:15.866 --> 26:16.867
Sit.

26:20.663 --> 26:21.664
Please.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.358
This war involves us all.

26:51.193 --> 26:52.278
You too, Dampyr.

27:00.369 --> 27:02.330
Something attacked us last night.

27:04.665 --> 27:05.666
Killed my men.

27:07.877 --> 27:09.754
Something not of this world.

27:12.715 --> 27:13.924
I want to know what.

27:15.676 --> 27:17.511
And they tell me that you know.

27:22.475 --> 27:24.894
What exactly are you?

27:26.312 --> 27:27.313
Me?

27:30.983 --> 27:32.151
I'm a Dampyr.

27:33.944 --> 27:35.112
A vampire hunter.

27:37.990 --> 27:40.368
Me and my partner,
we go around making sure anyone bitten

27:40.451 --> 27:43.537
by those hellish creatures
doesn't come back to life.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.458
Then you know how to kill them.

27:49.001 --> 27:49.835
Yeah.

27:52.213 --> 27:55.466
But you really wanna know what I am?

28:00.262 --> 28:01.597
I'm full of shit.

28:04.058 --> 28:06.644
Vampires don't exist, you fucking fool.

28:25.079 --> 28:26.372
Get him up.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.624
I'm his manager. I have to be with him.

28:28.707 --> 28:30.626
He has the right
to have someone defend him.

28:31.377 --> 28:32.628
Hey. Harlan!

28:33.379 --> 28:36.173
Harlan. You wanna tell me
what you did to my partner?

28:36.257 --> 28:39.176
Here he is, all in one piece. For now.

28:48.310 --> 28:49.895
Take a good fucking look.

28:51.021 --> 28:55.109
I don't know who or what did this,
but the same could happen to you tonight.

28:55.192 --> 28:56.652
Are you fucking crazy?

28:57.194 --> 28:58.612
The Dampyr is bullshit!

28:58.696 --> 29:00.114
Hey, leave him.

29:03.033 --> 29:05.828
He's only saying that
just to save his own skin.

29:06.871 --> 29:09.874
But we come from the same town
and we all know what he really is.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.377
The son of the devil.

29:14.503 --> 29:17.631
The proof is in the fact
that he hasn't aged a bit

29:17.715 --> 29:19.133
since I first met him.

29:21.385 --> 29:24.096
Let's see which of you
is telling the truth.

29:24.638 --> 29:27.057
Lazar, give him your gun.

29:28.809 --> 29:29.643
Move!

29:35.149 --> 29:36.984
It's fully loaded.

29:38.319 --> 29:39.361
Don't waste it.

29:44.283 --> 29:45.534
Load up!

29:49.163 --> 29:52.958
-You're gonna get him killed.
-Hey, we gave him a gun.

29:53.042 --> 29:56.462
Your friend is the goat
to attract the wolf.

29:56.545 --> 29:58.214
If he's what they say,

29:59.089 --> 30:01.300
he's the wolf, not the goat.

30:06.013 --> 30:07.723
Let's see how this plays out.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.496
What a shitty night.

31:39.815 --> 31:40.816
Help.

31:44.445 --> 31:45.279
Hey.

31:47.031 --> 31:49.283
-Hey, it's okay.
-Please don't hurt me.

31:49.992 --> 31:51.076
What you doing in here?

31:52.411 --> 31:54.204
I'm just trying to stay alive.

31:55.706 --> 31:56.874
It's okay.

31:57.666 --> 31:58.667
Please.

32:10.179 --> 32:11.847
Hey, hey, hey.

32:14.391 --> 32:15.476
Hey.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.322
The smell of your blood.

32:29.698 --> 32:31.825
-What are you?
-What--? What am I?

32:31.909 --> 32:33.452
What the fuck are you?

32:44.755 --> 32:46.632
On your feet, handsome.

32:46.715 --> 32:47.716
Time for dinner.

32:53.681 --> 32:54.848
Harlan?

32:55.683 --> 32:58.268
-We need to see what's happened to him.
-No one leaves.

33:10.781 --> 33:12.991
What have you got against my T-shirt?

33:13.742 --> 33:16.578
-Now I'm gonna ruin yours.
-No, Bojan, no!

33:35.639 --> 33:37.015
He isn't human.

33:38.183 --> 33:39.601
How the fuck did you do that?

33:52.865 --> 33:54.241
Move!

33:56.452 --> 33:57.453
Fire!

34:24.353 --> 34:27.357
Kill him. Kill him! Kill him!

34:59.598 --> 35:00.849
The Dampyr.

35:01.892 --> 35:02.976
Dampyr.

35:35.551 --> 35:38.220
Come back here, my children,
you cannot defeat him.

35:39.805 --> 35:40.639
Not you.

35:44.810 --> 35:45.853
You stay.

35:48.522 --> 35:50.732
Stay with him and be my eyes.

36:26.602 --> 36:27.728
He's still alive!

36:43.702 --> 36:45.162
I thought I was gonna lose you.

36:50.000 --> 36:51.084
Oh, my God, are you okay?

36:51.793 --> 36:52.628
Yeah.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.689
Kurjak, let's get the hell out
of this damn place.

37:12.773 --> 37:14.566
If we stay here, we all die.

37:14.650 --> 37:16.318
Yeah, they'll kill us all.

37:25.327 --> 37:26.828
What the fuck did you do to him?

37:28.288 --> 37:29.289
It was the sun.

37:30.540 --> 37:32.125
There's a girl inside you should see.

37:34.878 --> 37:35.879
Fuck.

37:37.339 --> 37:38.548
Get inside.

37:45.931 --> 37:46.974
You scared?

37:49.226 --> 37:51.353
Are you fucking scared?

37:52.312 --> 37:53.313
Lazar!

37:57.150 --> 37:58.694
-Move! Inside!
-Move!

37:59.569 --> 38:00.404
Move!

38:21.758 --> 38:22.968
We have a prisoner.

38:25.804 --> 38:27.222
Step back!

38:31.101 --> 38:32.227
No one leaves.

38:37.733 --> 38:39.651
Nothing personal, Kurjak,

38:40.444 --> 38:43.780
but they didn't say anything
about fighting vampires when I signed up.

38:45.907 --> 38:48.160
You want to face a court martial, Stefan?

38:48.243 --> 38:51.371
You brought us
to this shithole of a village

38:51.455 --> 38:53.373
to feed us to these monsters.

38:54.708 --> 38:57.085
A bunch of our buddies are dead already!

38:57.753 --> 39:01.381
Maybe you're the one
who should face a court martial.

39:01.465 --> 39:02.299
And you...

39:03.383 --> 39:07.429
if you really are a vampire killer,
then waste that thing.

39:08.096 --> 39:12.059
Let's drag its ass out into the sun
and burn it like the other one!

39:13.018 --> 39:14.311
Let's kill that mons--

39:14.978 --> 39:17.814
-What the hell are you doing, asshole?
-Makes no sense killing her.

39:19.066 --> 39:20.067
He's right.

39:21.443 --> 39:24.488
That's the only thing that can tell us
what the fuck we are up against.

39:25.113 --> 39:27.240
Let's leave Kurjak here with that thing.

39:27.324 --> 39:29.701
-Right. They can kill each other.
-Fuck, yeah.

39:34.289 --> 39:36.374
Let's get the hell out of here!

39:37.000 --> 39:37.834
Let's go!

39:43.840 --> 39:45.634
It's crazy to stay here, Emil.

39:47.052 --> 39:48.053
Come with us.

39:49.387 --> 39:51.181
-Let's cross the--
-I'm no deserter.

39:54.518 --> 39:57.604
These things could kill us all...

39:58.855 --> 40:00.398
and you want to walk away?

40:01.399 --> 40:03.026
Pretend they don't exist?

40:06.279 --> 40:07.114
Hey.

40:08.615 --> 40:10.742
What the hell are we doing here
with this crazy soldier

40:10.826 --> 40:12.244
and that monster over there?

40:15.664 --> 40:16.665
Yuri, look, you...

40:20.585 --> 40:22.379
You can't stay here, okay?

40:23.672 --> 40:24.506
What?

40:26.508 --> 40:30.428
There are some strange things
happening to me and I need to...

40:32.305 --> 40:34.474
I need to stay here and figure them out.

40:35.559 --> 40:37.602
-No, I...
-They'll be back. It's...

40:39.521 --> 40:40.981
It's dangerous. It's not safe.

40:41.064 --> 40:42.649
I'm not leaving you here.

40:44.985 --> 40:46.194
-You gotta go.
-No.

40:47.070 --> 40:47.904
No.

40:51.867 --> 40:52.951
Harlan.

40:55.328 --> 40:56.663
Take the boy with you.

40:57.414 --> 40:58.915
Me and Harlan are a team.

41:00.458 --> 41:01.459
Tell them, Harlan.

41:02.252 --> 41:03.253
Harlan?

41:05.839 --> 41:09.551
Hey, you said
we'd always stick together, you promised.

41:09.634 --> 41:10.635
Let's go, kid.

41:10.719 --> 41:12.345
-You promised me, Harlan.
-Let's go.

41:13.388 --> 41:15.515
I thought we were family, Harlan.

41:15.599 --> 41:16.641
Please, Harlan.

41:17.225 --> 41:19.561
Please. Don't do this to me, Harlan.

41:19.644 --> 41:21.605
Let me stay with you, Harlan, please.

41:22.230 --> 41:24.274
Come away with us. Please, Harlan.

41:26.026 --> 41:27.152
Harlan, please.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.947
-Let go of me!
-Look at it this way, Kurjak.

41:32.616 --> 41:35.994
Staying here could be the best way
to get yourself killed...

41:36.870 --> 41:38.079
and see your son again.

41:39.664 --> 41:42.209
Run as far as you can, Stefan.

41:44.211 --> 41:47.255
Because as soon as command finds out
you're fucking chicken,

41:48.048 --> 41:49.257
they will come for you.

41:50.926 --> 41:53.136
Then we'll make sure
you can't tell anyone...

41:55.555 --> 41:56.556
commander.

41:57.515 --> 41:58.350
Door!

41:59.643 --> 42:01.269
Lock them with the monster.

42:17.953 --> 42:18.954
Let's go.

43:05.250 --> 43:06.251
Fuck!

43:10.505 --> 43:11.923
-How's that working out?
-Shut up.

43:13.717 --> 43:14.551
Why?

43:16.678 --> 43:17.887
You've got no fucking plan.

43:18.555 --> 43:21.266
How about we start getting
some answers from that bitch?

43:28.857 --> 43:29.691
Move.

43:31.318 --> 43:32.152
No.

43:33.820 --> 43:34.821
Move.

43:36.281 --> 43:37.282
It's Tesla.

43:41.411 --> 43:42.412
Not "bitch."

43:44.622 --> 43:46.875
You defended me before, soldier.

43:48.126 --> 43:48.960
And you...

43:50.462 --> 43:53.590
Dampyr, you could have killed me,
but I'm still alive.

43:55.550 --> 43:56.843
I owe you.

43:56.926 --> 43:58.803
Remember whose side you're on.

44:00.889 --> 44:03.308
You saw the hate in her eyes, right?

44:04.100 --> 44:05.185
I don't hate you.

44:06.644 --> 44:08.021
I hate Gorka.

44:12.275 --> 44:13.276
Who's Gorka?

44:14.069 --> 44:16.863
My master, Lord of the Night.

44:17.447 --> 44:19.240
It's because of him I am what I am.

44:20.742 --> 44:22.494
Lord of the what?

44:24.037 --> 44:25.872
For a Dampyr, you don't know much, do you?

44:27.624 --> 44:29.709
Unlike us ordinary vampires,

44:30.502 --> 44:32.504
Lords of the Night don't fear
the sunlight.

44:33.296 --> 44:36.716
Only Lords of the Night have power
to give life to other vampires...

44:38.259 --> 44:39.594
and to generate those like you.

44:39.677 --> 44:40.970
What do you mean, like me?

44:41.054 --> 44:43.431
-Keep your distance from the beast.
-Shut up!

44:45.600 --> 44:46.601
I need to know.

44:48.895 --> 44:51.564
If a Lord of the Night mates
with a non-vampire woman,

44:52.565 --> 44:53.942
she will give birth to a Dampyr.

44:54.025 --> 44:56.778
-I'm not-- I'm not a--
-Your blood tells a different story.

44:57.862 --> 44:59.239
I never knew my father.

44:59.989 --> 45:02.117
He obviously hid the truth from you
to protect you.

45:03.368 --> 45:05.620
The Lords of the Night kill
those like you at birth.

45:05.703 --> 45:07.080
You're way too dangerous.

45:07.997 --> 45:10.792
And now, from the moment
you killed one of his slaves,

45:10.875 --> 45:12.502
Gorka knows you exist.

45:12.585 --> 45:13.586
Which means what?

45:13.670 --> 45:15.672
He'll do anything to exterminate you.

45:43.908 --> 45:45.076
Javor.

45:45.827 --> 45:46.661
Shit.

45:53.293 --> 45:54.627
What's going on?

45:55.295 --> 45:57.589
-Javor?
-What the fuck is happening?

45:57.672 --> 45:58.715
Why did you stop?

46:02.927 --> 46:03.761
Javor.

46:05.388 --> 46:06.806
Javor! Javor!

46:08.266 --> 46:09.392
Javor! Javor!

46:35.793 --> 46:37.545
Run, kid! Run!

46:49.057 --> 46:51.392
Run, Yuri! Run!

47:15.542 --> 47:16.584
Run, Yuri!

47:17.710 --> 47:18.711
What's happening?

47:21.923 --> 47:23.967
-The fuck are you doing to him?
-It's him.

47:25.969 --> 47:26.803
Gorka.

47:29.973 --> 47:31.015
Run!

47:37.522 --> 47:38.648
Run, Yuri!

47:38.731 --> 47:40.316
Run!

47:55.081 --> 47:56.082
Harlan!

48:06.092 --> 48:07.218
He's got Yuri.

48:08.720 --> 48:10.096
He's got your men.

48:15.602 --> 48:16.603
It's my fault.

48:29.574 --> 48:30.742
Can you take me to him?

48:32.702 --> 48:33.536
Please.

48:34.996 --> 48:37.790
Yes, bring him here to my slaughterhouse.

48:39.125 --> 48:40.668
Our pack was going back to the city.

48:43.296 --> 48:44.714
I can help you find him.

48:48.217 --> 48:50.053
Why the fuck would you do that?

48:52.472 --> 48:55.016
Only a Dampyr can kill
the Lord of the Night.

48:56.726 --> 48:57.769
If Gorka dies...

48:59.062 --> 49:00.063
I'm free.

49:13.117 --> 49:14.202
I don't trust her.

49:16.496 --> 49:20.083
She's one of them.
She'll jump us the first chance she gets.

49:21.084 --> 49:22.168
No.

49:22.251 --> 49:23.419
She's scared of me.

49:24.045 --> 49:25.046
I'll watch her, okay?

49:25.880 --> 49:29.050
First thing we have to do is find a way
out of this fucking church.

49:30.009 --> 49:32.970
Well, that's easy, soldier boy.

50:31.529 --> 50:32.780
Nice handbag.

50:33.865 --> 50:35.074
Come on, pretty boy.

50:40.872 --> 50:42.165
I see you went shopping too.

51:18.951 --> 51:19.952
Leave it.

51:27.251 --> 51:29.420
That mask you're wearing suits you.

51:30.338 --> 51:34.717
Don't you know that sunlight is bad
for the skin, soldier boy?

51:42.892 --> 51:43.893
What are you?

51:46.145 --> 51:46.979
Mom?

51:47.063 --> 51:48.356
Monster! Monster!

51:48.439 --> 51:51.025
You're damned.
And so is your mother, that filthy witch.

51:51.108 --> 51:53.194
-My mother isn't a witch!
-Get out of here!

51:53.277 --> 51:55.947
The smell of your blood. What are you?

51:56.030 --> 51:57.782
-Mom!
-What exactly are you?

51:57.865 --> 51:58.908
Monster! Monster!

51:59.659 --> 52:01.327
-What do you mean, like me?
-Mom!

52:01.410 --> 52:03.830
What exactly are you?

52:05.164 --> 52:06.541
The son of the devil.

52:11.212 --> 52:12.213
Harlan.

52:13.256 --> 52:14.340
Come here to me.

52:14.423 --> 52:15.675
Be careful, Harlan.

52:20.847 --> 52:21.681
What?

52:23.349 --> 52:24.350
What happened?

52:25.726 --> 52:26.978
You tell me.

52:27.770 --> 52:29.397
You blacked out in the car.

52:30.731 --> 52:33.025
Started babbling like crazy.

52:34.402 --> 52:37.071
Shaking like you were possessed
or something.

52:41.367 --> 52:42.785
I've always had nightmares.

52:44.495 --> 52:46.038
Now they seem more and more real.

52:47.582 --> 52:51.544
Like memories trying to re-emerge.
I-- I don't know.

52:54.005 --> 52:55.423
You must think I'm fucking crazy.

52:55.506 --> 52:57.633
What we've been through
would drive anyone crazy.

53:05.933 --> 53:06.767
Fuck!

53:33.336 --> 53:37.214
Hey, she said
she was going for something to eat.

53:37.298 --> 53:39.550
And we know what her diet consists of.

53:39.634 --> 53:41.761
Her friends could show up at any moment.

53:42.553 --> 53:44.055
I don't have any friends.

53:46.182 --> 53:48.601
But I can hear you whisper from far away.

53:51.270 --> 53:53.022
Didn't your mother teach you it's rude...

53:53.814 --> 53:55.983
to whisper about people
behind their backs?

53:58.402 --> 53:59.528
Soldier boy?

54:00.821 --> 54:03.491
Besides, I've seen
the way you fight your war.

54:04.325 --> 54:06.994
Do you think you're better
than those like me?

54:11.749 --> 54:14.377
You know nothing of war.

54:19.340 --> 54:21.258
Would you two just fucking quit?

54:42.863 --> 54:44.573
Your wounds are disappearing.

54:47.159 --> 54:48.369
You're just like us.

54:50.871 --> 54:53.290
You can't expect Kurjak
to accept it as normal.

54:55.626 --> 54:56.877
It's hard for me too.

55:00.214 --> 55:01.424
Blood has memories.

55:03.634 --> 55:05.511
Believe me, I'd rather forget everything

55:05.594 --> 55:08.264
than live with the memory
of what Gorka forced me to endure.

55:10.891 --> 55:12.560
And what he forced me to do.

55:21.485 --> 55:22.319
Tesla...

55:25.489 --> 55:26.490
I'm trusting you.

55:32.455 --> 55:33.456
Don't worry.

55:53.392 --> 55:54.393
What the...?

56:31.055 --> 56:36.477
It gives me such pleasure
to feel the fear pulsating in your veins.

56:37.394 --> 56:41.732
I shall never tire of playing
with your miserable lives,

56:41.816 --> 56:44.527
whilst you pray in vain to be spared.

56:59.208 --> 57:02.586
How does it feel
to know your life is coming to an end?

57:04.004 --> 57:06.549
I have no idea what death feels like.

57:08.259 --> 57:10.761
I can sniff a hint of it from your terror.

57:12.972 --> 57:16.433
We have always existed,
and we always will,

57:16.517 --> 57:20.688
being close to kings and emperors,
led them and killed them.

57:21.856 --> 57:24.900
Whatever was necessary
to placate our thirst.

57:25.526 --> 57:29.280
Past, present
and future are meaningless to us.

57:30.030 --> 57:33.534
Only blood is important.

57:35.661 --> 57:37.913
I will unleash you from your fear.

57:38.747 --> 57:41.876
And you, faithful dog...

57:42.585 --> 57:46.255
will join my army.

58:16.327 --> 58:18.704
Everyone's trying
to get out of this hellhole...

58:21.457 --> 58:23.292
and we're thinking of going in.

58:24.210 --> 58:26.503
I know how to get us
around the roadblocks.

58:28.631 --> 58:29.924
But once we're in...

58:32.009 --> 58:33.510
once it gets dark...

58:34.845 --> 58:37.723
if there really are more like the beast...

58:39.350 --> 58:41.018
then this won't do any good.

58:53.906 --> 58:54.907
You never know.

59:12.132 --> 59:14.009
Now that the bloodsucker is
more comfortable,

59:14.093 --> 59:16.011
you want to tell me what you have in mind?

59:34.822 --> 59:36.282
You think it'll work?

59:37.157 --> 59:38.784
You're the vampire, Tesla.

59:38.867 --> 59:40.035
What do you think?

59:41.745 --> 59:42.746
It could.

59:43.539 --> 59:44.707
Could?

59:46.125 --> 59:47.543
Let's fucking see.

59:49.712 --> 59:50.546
Well...

59:52.548 --> 59:53.674
guess we load them up.

59:54.842 --> 59:56.510
Not just a pretty face, huh?

59:58.637 --> 59:59.471
Here.

01:00:05.728 --> 01:00:06.895
You want one?

01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:08.897
Yeah.

01:00:09.690 --> 01:00:10.941
The beast wants one.

01:00:13.902 --> 01:00:15.529
You're dangerous enough without one.

01:00:18.324 --> 01:00:19.491
You're right, soldier boy.

01:00:20.951 --> 01:00:23.203
But if I wanted to kill you,
you'd be dead already.

01:00:27.041 --> 01:00:29.710
But if I enter the city barehanded,
I'm dead meat.

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:33.797
Suits me. I won't have
to watch my back for you anymore.

01:00:36.091 --> 01:00:38.802
You know,
you're really starting to piss me off.

01:00:41.263 --> 01:00:43.724
Tesla! Just... let him go.

01:00:48.604 --> 01:00:52.941
How about we see
if these new bullets work, huh, Harlan?

01:00:53.025 --> 01:00:54.151
Go ahead.

01:00:54.902 --> 01:00:55.736
Shoot.

01:00:56.487 --> 01:00:58.155
It'd only be a liberation for me.

01:00:59.865 --> 01:01:03.327
Your war is child's play
compared to what I've been through.

01:01:04.286 --> 01:01:06.080
So do me a favor, soldier boy,

01:01:06.163 --> 01:01:09.291
cut your macho-man bullshit.

01:01:16.215 --> 01:01:17.049
Hey.

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:33.190
Tesla...

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:37.820
you know I could have shot you, right?

01:01:39.822 --> 01:01:40.656
I know.

01:01:43.951 --> 01:01:44.952
But you didn't.

01:01:47.246 --> 01:01:49.206
Because you know what it means
to be different.

01:01:56.130 --> 01:01:57.131
Be careful.

01:01:58.799 --> 01:01:59.800
It's my blood.

01:02:08.767 --> 01:02:10.227
Let's move, lovebirds.

01:03:45.614 --> 01:03:46.698
I've done my bit.

01:03:48.575 --> 01:03:50.202
Now it's the bloodsucker's turn.

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:54.665
Gorka's lair is under the old library.
We need to walk through this--

01:03:57.334 --> 01:03:58.168
Move!

01:04:11.306 --> 01:04:12.140
Come on.

01:04:19.773 --> 01:04:20.857
Dad! Dad, wait!

01:04:21.567 --> 01:04:22.693
Naya, come on!

01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:25.112
Hurry up, hurry up!

01:04:26.113 --> 01:04:27.114
They're coming.

01:04:28.699 --> 01:04:31.410
-Let's go, let's go!
-Let's go, they're coming!

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:34.496
Let's go, let's go!

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:40.919
-What is it?
-It's better to avoid the busier streets.

01:04:41.587 --> 01:04:42.421
Come on.

01:04:43.297 --> 01:04:44.298
Follow me.

01:04:45.215 --> 01:04:46.300
Something's wrong.

01:04:46.925 --> 01:04:47.759
Tesla!

01:05:02.441 --> 01:05:04.359
We've been walking for hours.

01:05:05.652 --> 01:05:07.988
I think the bitch walked us
into a fucking trap.

01:05:08.697 --> 01:05:10.073
I can't get you to him.

01:05:10.699 --> 01:05:11.992
Gorka set it up.

01:05:13.035 --> 01:05:15.037
-He knows we're coming.
-You warned him.

01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:16.121
I didn't have to.

01:05:16.204 --> 01:05:18.332
Lords of the Night know everything,
you can't hide from them.

01:05:18.415 --> 01:05:19.791
You fucking warned him!

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:26.089
They're here.

01:05:36.058 --> 01:05:37.809
Son of a bitch.

01:05:47.027 --> 01:05:48.028
Fuck!

01:05:51.239 --> 01:05:52.324
Move!

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:06.254
Stop, you bastards!

01:06:29.986 --> 01:06:32.364
It fucking works! I told you it would.

01:07:20.871 --> 01:07:23.582
Our new master...

01:07:24.416 --> 01:07:26.543
wants you dead,

01:07:26.626 --> 01:07:28.628
you son of a witch.

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:40.599
Told you war was bad for you,
you little shit.

01:07:56.281 --> 01:07:57.157
Fuck you!

01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:19.720
Need some help there, old man?

01:08:21.765 --> 01:08:22.599
Fuck you.

01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:24.935
Come on.

01:08:27.938 --> 01:08:28.939
There we go.

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:40.325
The only one I wanted to kill was Stefan.

01:08:40.408 --> 01:08:41.283
I know.

01:08:42.493 --> 01:08:43.328
Wait!

01:08:48.375 --> 01:08:49.376
Fuck this.

01:08:50.961 --> 01:08:52.002
It's okay.

01:08:52.754 --> 01:08:53.587
Harlan.

01:09:01.763 --> 01:09:02.764
It's Gorka.

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:06.600
He's making me do this.

01:09:14.943 --> 01:09:16.319
You can fight him, Tesla.

01:09:19.281 --> 01:09:20.282
You're wrong.

01:09:21.658 --> 01:09:22.993
He's too strong.

01:09:25.495 --> 01:09:26.705
Move out of the fucking way.

01:09:37.674 --> 01:09:39.676
You are not his slave.

01:09:40.886 --> 01:09:41.886
I can't help it.

01:09:43.345 --> 01:09:44.180
Move.

01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:45.974
Kill me.

01:09:47.225 --> 01:09:49.978
Please kill me. Please kill me.

01:09:51.520 --> 01:09:52.397
Fuck it!

01:09:54.316 --> 01:09:55.567
I'm sorry.

01:09:55.650 --> 01:09:56.776
Harlan!

01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:58.153
Hey. Come.

01:09:58.862 --> 01:09:59.696
Come.

01:10:00.947 --> 01:10:01.781
Fuck.

01:10:05.035 --> 01:10:07.537
Okay. Clean the wound.

01:10:08.288 --> 01:10:10.206
-It is going to sting.
-Okay.

01:10:10.290 --> 01:10:11.416
-Ready?
-Yeah.

01:10:17.047 --> 01:10:18.965
There we go.

01:10:19.049 --> 01:10:20.675
Okay, okay.

01:10:22.552 --> 01:10:23.553
-Drink.
-Yeah.

01:10:24.888 --> 01:10:25.931
That's it.

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:27.807
You're gonna be okay.

01:10:31.353 --> 01:10:32.771
-Brave boy.
-Yeah.

01:10:44.324 --> 01:10:45.659
That photo in your pocket...

01:10:49.079 --> 01:10:50.580
it was your wife and son, right?

01:10:55.210 --> 01:10:57.712
Miklos and Miljiana.

01:11:06.179 --> 01:11:09.432
Miklos was 9 when he was killed.

01:11:12.936 --> 01:11:13.770
I'm sorry.

01:11:16.106 --> 01:11:17.107
This is war.

01:11:29.494 --> 01:11:30.745
Keep the pressure on.

01:11:39.587 --> 01:11:42.382
From the moment you're born...

01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:46.845
they tell you
that their way is the right way.

01:11:50.348 --> 01:11:53.685
They teach you to the point that
not only do you believe it yourself...

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:57.480
but in the end...

01:11:59.149 --> 01:12:01.609
it becomes you who teaches it to others.

01:12:04.070 --> 01:12:05.447
To command it, even.

01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:08.908
Maybe there is no right team.

01:12:13.872 --> 01:12:15.957
Maybe we're all destined
to be on the wrong side.

01:12:18.835 --> 01:12:23.214
Or maybe this is the only war
that deserves to be fought.

01:13:34.369 --> 01:13:35.453
Please, don't!

01:14:04.357 --> 01:14:05.567
You can't rebel.

01:14:06.192 --> 01:14:08.027
We belong to the same master.

01:14:24.752 --> 01:14:26.171
I belong to no one.

01:14:39.392 --> 01:14:40.393
It's okay.

01:14:52.530 --> 01:14:54.991
Love is so overestimated.

01:14:57.160 --> 01:14:58.703
I prefer fear.

01:15:03.333 --> 01:15:05.919
And you are scared now, Tesla.

01:15:07.503 --> 01:15:10.465
Because you know, like a dog,

01:15:10.548 --> 01:15:12.967
you have bitten the hand that feeds you.

01:15:36.157 --> 01:15:38.368
A vampire and a Dampyr.

01:15:40.536 --> 01:15:42.455
Don't you see the irony of that?

01:15:43.665 --> 01:15:46.334
You are insignificant!

01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:58.471
A puppet who only moves
when I pull the strings.

01:16:00.223 --> 01:16:01.391
My property.

01:16:03.017 --> 01:16:04.060
And mine alone.

01:16:06.521 --> 01:16:08.022
The Dampyr will find you...

01:16:12.777 --> 01:16:14.028
and he will kill you.

01:16:17.657 --> 01:16:19.325
I want him to find me.

01:16:20.410 --> 01:16:27.000
And then I will remedy the mistake
they made in allowing him to live.

01:16:45.351 --> 01:16:46.686
You're not much of a nurse.

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:49.689
Is this how you watch over the dying?

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:52.650
You got a death wish? No?

01:16:57.447 --> 01:17:00.491
Nice to see that when you were
patching me up, you took more of my blood.

01:17:06.289 --> 01:17:07.373
Let me see the wound.

01:17:12.045 --> 01:17:12.920
Shit.

01:17:13.004 --> 01:17:16.049
-And it doesn't hurt.
-Never seen anything like it.

01:17:19.969 --> 01:17:23.097
I partnered up
with a fucking superhero, huh?

01:17:23.181 --> 01:17:24.015
Yeah.

01:17:27.769 --> 01:17:29.145
Or maybe a monster.

01:17:46.204 --> 01:17:47.413
This looks like the place.

01:17:50.625 --> 01:17:52.293
What now, pretty boy?

01:17:53.586 --> 01:17:54.420
Go in,

01:17:55.129 --> 01:17:56.214
kill Gorka,

01:17:57.340 --> 01:17:58.341
free Yuri.

01:17:59.675 --> 01:18:00.676
Simple.

01:18:01.886 --> 01:18:02.887
Simple.

01:18:23.408 --> 01:18:24.409
It's quiet.

01:18:25.493 --> 01:18:26.494
Too quiet.

01:18:29.747 --> 01:18:30.957
Let's meet upstairs.

01:19:13.416 --> 01:19:14.417
Daddy?

01:19:16.043 --> 01:19:17.044
Miklos?

01:19:19.630 --> 01:19:20.631
Daddy?

01:19:23.301 --> 01:19:24.594
Fucking hell!

01:19:26.637 --> 01:19:27.638
Daddy...

01:19:28.890 --> 01:19:30.224
why did you leave me?

01:19:33.519 --> 01:19:34.812
Why did you leave me?

01:19:37.982 --> 01:19:39.358
Why did you leave me?

01:19:58.794 --> 01:19:59.795
Kurjak?

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:33.723
Tesla?

01:21:38.102 --> 01:21:38.936
Tesla.

01:21:54.243 --> 01:21:55.828
Have a good nap...

01:21:57.246 --> 01:21:58.247
commander?

01:22:14.889 --> 01:22:15.723
Leave her.

01:22:18.559 --> 01:22:19.393
Leave her!

01:22:21.354 --> 01:22:22.772
Fucking leave her!

01:22:27.401 --> 01:22:28.402
Stop!

01:22:45.461 --> 01:22:46.879
You fucking piece of shit.

01:22:52.343 --> 01:22:53.594
Stop!

01:23:07.274 --> 01:23:11.028
I've always despised you, Kurjak.

01:23:13.114 --> 01:23:18.494
You and your obsession with rules.

01:23:20.287 --> 01:23:23.290
Your fucking sense of honor.

01:23:44.812 --> 01:23:49.483
They might have turned you
into a monster, Stefan...

01:23:50.901 --> 01:23:54.155
but one thing will never change.

01:23:57.658 --> 01:23:59.535
You're still a fucking pussy.

01:26:06.412 --> 01:26:07.413
Gorka!

01:26:12.001 --> 01:26:13.002
Yuri!

01:26:30.936 --> 01:26:33.522
I've been expecting you, Dampyr.

01:26:39.820 --> 01:26:41.155
You're too slow.

01:26:44.742 --> 01:26:46.201
And now,

01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:48.412
in my kingdom,

01:26:49.288 --> 01:26:50.956
I can finally kill you.

01:27:01.175 --> 01:27:03.552
You can try it, you fucking monster.

01:27:04.595 --> 01:27:05.596
Monster?

01:27:08.057 --> 01:27:08.891
Me?

01:27:12.227 --> 01:27:15.147
You're the only abomination here.

01:27:22.404 --> 01:27:24.698
Now that I have you in front of me,

01:27:25.741 --> 01:27:31.246
your stink confirms
what I have always suspected.

01:27:33.082 --> 01:27:35.709
You belong to Draka's lineage.

01:27:36.961 --> 01:27:38.545
Draka was a fool.

01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:43.801
He should never have let you
into this world or live so long.

01:27:44.551 --> 01:27:48.472
And if he wanted to use you
solely for revenge...

01:27:49.890 --> 01:27:51.767
then he miscalculated.

01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:57.856
Just as I drove him from here
centuries ago...

01:27:59.191 --> 01:28:02.778
now I will kill you.

01:28:04.029 --> 01:28:07.533
Blood of his blood...

01:28:09.410 --> 01:28:11.829
how dare you live so long?

01:28:19.420 --> 01:28:20.796
Impressive.

01:28:21.422 --> 01:28:23.590
Don't you think it's sublime...

01:28:31.265 --> 01:28:34.226
the futility of all this?

01:28:54.788 --> 01:28:57.332
No, don't faint yet.

01:28:58.584 --> 01:29:01.754
I have someone who wants
to say goodbye to you.

01:29:07.051 --> 01:29:09.053
A special friend.

01:29:22.941 --> 01:29:23.776
Harlan?

01:29:27.488 --> 01:29:28.489
Yu-- Yuri.

01:29:37.081 --> 01:29:38.582
Yuri, forgive me.

01:29:40.042 --> 01:29:42.836
For what? I knew you'd come for me.

01:29:49.510 --> 01:29:51.345
Unfortunately, it's too late.

01:29:55.140 --> 01:29:55.974
Yuri.

01:29:58.644 --> 01:29:59.686
No!

01:30:15.536 --> 01:30:17.079
I'm sorry, old friend.

01:30:18.580 --> 01:30:20.124
Gorka is my master now.

01:30:29.758 --> 01:30:33.512
I couldn't stop him. He was in my head.

01:30:36.431 --> 01:30:37.266
I know.

01:30:42.813 --> 01:30:46.483
I don't wanna live like this.
Please, Harlan.

01:30:55.242 --> 01:30:56.660
It's okay, Yuri.

01:30:57.828 --> 01:30:58.829
I'm here.

01:31:02.749 --> 01:31:04.501
You're a true Dampyr, my friend.

01:31:06.461 --> 01:31:10.299
It was great... working with you.

01:31:40.996 --> 01:31:43.916
What a heartbreaking farewell.

01:32:28.001 --> 01:32:30.295
The soldier and the traitor.

01:32:31.380 --> 01:32:32.839
You fucking bastard.

01:32:44.017 --> 01:32:45.978
You will remain buried here...

01:32:46.728 --> 01:32:49.856
drenched in the suffering
these walls have seen.

01:32:51.566 --> 01:32:54.403
And you will live
that suffering for eternity...

01:32:55.279 --> 01:32:59.491
with every fiber of your being.

01:33:31.315 --> 01:33:33.608
It's time to choose, Harlan.

01:33:39.948 --> 01:33:40.949
I must know.

01:34:11.563 --> 01:34:14.483
Harlan. Come.

01:34:16.735 --> 01:34:18.153
Come here to me.

01:34:32.167 --> 01:34:33.627
What is wrong, Harlan?

01:34:36.671 --> 01:34:38.840
Are you afraid of your own father?

01:34:43.095 --> 01:34:47.140
Or should I perhaps be afraid of my son?

01:34:50.477 --> 01:34:53.063
Listen to your blood, my son.

01:34:55.690 --> 01:34:57.734
Listen to who you are.

01:36:57.312 --> 01:36:59.731
Why did Draka let you live, Dampyr?

01:37:00.524 --> 01:37:01.358
Why?

01:37:24.965 --> 01:37:30.303
I have lived like a god amongst creatures
that are destined to die.

01:37:33.098 --> 01:37:35.016
But because of you, Dampyr...

01:37:36.977 --> 01:37:38.144
now I know...

01:37:40.689 --> 01:37:42.691
the brilliant glare...

01:37:45.694 --> 01:37:46.861
of death.

01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:31.990
You fought well, soldier.

01:38:55.388 --> 01:38:56.222
Come on.

01:39:42.477 --> 01:39:43.687
What is this place?

01:39:45.021 --> 01:39:47.315
This can't have anything to do with Gorka.

01:39:48.733 --> 01:39:50.819
Gorka said it once belonged to my father.

01:40:16.469 --> 01:40:17.554
This is my father.

01:40:19.055 --> 01:40:20.640
That's how I see him in my visions.

01:40:21.808 --> 01:40:24.185
I guess ugly runs in the family, then.

01:40:43.997 --> 01:40:45.915
There are many others like him.

01:40:47.333 --> 01:40:49.669
Then it's going to be a long war.

01:40:51.004 --> 01:40:53.173
Welcome to the world of nightmares,
soldier boy.

01:40:55.508 --> 01:40:57.135
We're gonna become their nightmare.

01:41:51.564 --> 01:41:54.400
Our son has made his choice, Velma.

01:41:58.196 --> 01:41:59.280
He has become...

01:42:00.448 --> 01:42:01.533
the Dampyr.

01:42:02.575 --> 01:42:05.620
But he didn't agree to follow you.

01:42:06.704 --> 01:42:08.373
Nor to become your ally.

01:42:08.456 --> 01:42:10.917
He might try to kill you.

01:42:13.002 --> 01:42:14.003
Perhaps.

01:42:15.463 --> 01:42:16.464
Or...

01:42:17.590 --> 01:42:20.385
perhaps he will heed
the call of his blood.

01:42:23.596 --> 01:42:25.348
My blood.

01:42:32.772 --> 01:42:34.399
For this is only the beginning.

01:42:37.402 --> 01:42:39.571
The beginning of my war.
