00:27.550 --> 00:29.550
Tired of the same old you?

00:29.650 --> 00:33.550
Tired of being out of shape
and out of luck with the opposite sex?

00:33.850 --> 00:37.350
Tired of being overweight
and under-attractive?

00:37.650 --> 00:39.050
Yeah.

00:39.150 --> 00:40.850
Oh, hello.

00:41.050 --> 00:46.350
I'm White Goodman, owner, operator
and founder of Globo Gym America Corp.

00:46.650 --> 00:50.550
I'm here to tell ya that you don't have
to be stuck with what you've got.

00:50.850 --> 00:53.350
Hey, Rory. Looking good.

00:53.550 --> 00:58.750
At Globo Gym we that understand "ugliness"
and "fatness" are genetic disorders,

00:59.050 --> 01:01.350
much like baldness or necrophilia,

01:01.550 --> 01:05.450
and it's only your fault if you don't hate
yourself enough to do something about it.

01:06.850 --> 01:09.450
That's where we come in.

01:09.650 --> 01:12.750
Globo Gym employs
a highly trained, quasi-cultural staff

01:12.950 --> 01:15.750
of personal alteration specialists.

01:15.950 --> 01:18.750
With our competitively priced
onsite cosmetic surgery,

01:19.050 --> 01:22.150
we can turn that Frankenstein
you see in the mirror every morning

01:22.350 --> 01:24.250
into a Franken-fine.

01:25.150 --> 01:27.250
Of course, you'll still be you
in a legal sense,

01:27.450 --> 01:30.050
but think of it as a thinner,
more attractive, better you

01:30.250 --> 01:32.250
than you could ever become without us.

01:32.450 --> 01:36.150
How do I know?
Well, I'm not only the founder of Globo Gym,

01:36.450 --> 01:38.350
I'm also a client.

01:41.050 --> 01:45.850
That's me, six years and 600lbs ago,
before I knew how much I hated myself.

01:46.150 --> 01:48.650
That all changed once I founded Globo Gym.

01:48.850 --> 01:55.350
But don'tjust take my word for it. Listen
to these Globo gymers tell you how it is...

01:59.050 --> 02:01.650
That feels good.

02:01.850 --> 02:04.050
Oh, the tickle machine.

02:07.350 --> 02:09.449
Crash, no. Crash, out.

02:09.650 --> 02:11.950
Bad dog. No grundle.

02:14.350 --> 02:16.450
Come on down and join the winning team,

02:16.650 --> 02:19.750
because here at Globo Gym,
we're better than you.

02:19.950 --> 02:22.050
And we know it.

02:22.250 --> 02:24.250
Spare me.

02:32.850 --> 02:36.050
Mr La Fleur, this is Doris
from the Department of Water and Power.

02:36.250 --> 02:39.550
We've been trying to reach you,
but your phone was disconnected.

02:39.850 --> 02:43.250
We'll be shutting off
your water and power at 5pm today

02:43.450 --> 02:48.650
due to an eight-month overdue account.
Thank you and have a nice day.

02:48.950 --> 02:52.950
This is Seth from Videorama.
The following DVDs are now overdue.

02:53.250 --> 02:59.150
<i>Drunken Hussies 3, Backdoor Patrol 5
and Mona Lisa Smile. Thank you.</i>

03:14.850 --> 03:17.650
Come on, baby, be there.
Be there.

03:24.450 --> 03:27.850
It's gonna be a good day.
I'm proud of you.

03:38.550 --> 03:44.450
We're just around the corner.
My gym's here. I promise we're almost there.

03:44.750 --> 03:46.550
You guys are lifesavers.

03:46.750 --> 03:49.650
I appreciate the effort.
Don't pull a hammy over it.

03:55.050 --> 03:58.550
Gimme that garbage.
Shouldn't you be on a treadmill?

04:02.550 --> 04:03.550
Hey, Peter.

04:03.750 --> 04:07.250
- How's my little tax shelter this morning?
- Everything's shipshape.

04:07.450 --> 04:10.750
Don't hold out on me. What's happening?

04:11.850 --> 04:15.950
It's just I'm trying
this new voicemail-dating thing.

04:16.250 --> 04:20.350
And, like, no one's even left me a message,
and it's been almost two months.

04:20.649 --> 04:23.150
There's someone out there for everybody.

04:23.350 --> 04:24.950
- You think?
- Absolutely.

04:25.150 --> 04:29.650
In some cases, there's two somebodies for
one person. I like to call that "the jackpot".

04:29.950 --> 04:31.950
See you later, dater.

04:33.850 --> 04:35.850
- Hey, Peter.
- Hey, Gordon.

04:36.050 --> 04:38.350
- I'm wailing on my glutes.
- Sounds great.

04:38.550 --> 04:42.550
I'm gonna shock the biceps later,
then some cardio. Keep the body guessing.

04:42.850 --> 04:47.050
- I like to keep my body guessing.
- Sure. I wanted to ask you something.

04:47.350 --> 04:49.950
- Did you catch the game last night?
- Can I say yes?

04:50.150 --> 04:52.650
Amateur curling championships
on ESPN8.

04:52.850 --> 04:56.050
- I had no idea.
- You missed a doozy. Really great stuff.

04:56.250 --> 04:59.050
I feel dumb for asking,
but how did you hear about it?

04:59.350 --> 05:02.850
<i>- OSQ. Obscure Sports Quarterly.
- Of course, the OSQ.</i>

05:03.050 --> 05:05.650
Started reading it in college,
for the chicks.

05:05.850 --> 05:08.350
- I'm glad that worked out for you.
- Thanks, Peter.

05:08.550 --> 05:11.050
- Bye.
- Love the orange and love the headphones.

05:11.250 --> 05:13.750
When I come back,
I want you on a different machine.

05:19.650 --> 05:21.850
- You need a spot?
- I'm cool, Pete.

05:22.050 --> 05:24.850
OK, come on. Let's get this out of here.
You OK?

05:25.050 --> 05:29.150
- You're like a human Chinese puzzle.
- Thanks, Pete.

05:29.450 --> 05:31.750
All that weight is dangerous.

05:31.950 --> 05:36.250
It'll be worth it when I make the cheerleading
squad. Prove to Amber that I'm not a loser.

05:36.550 --> 05:41.150
Hang on a second. You wanna become
a cheerleader to prove you are not a loser?

05:41.450 --> 05:43.850
Yeah. Why?

05:44.050 --> 05:46.650
Nothing. High school's
changed a bit since I was a kid.

05:46.850 --> 05:50.750
Plus, all anyone ever remembers is
what happened at last year's tryouts.

05:51.050 --> 05:53.050
I'm the laughing stock of the school.

05:53.250 --> 05:58.150
I'm sure it's not that big of a deal.
What happened at last year's tryouts?

05:59.050 --> 06:01.350
Justin Redmond. Ready and super-psyched.

06:02.050 --> 06:05.050
- Hey, Amber.
- Hi, Justin. Good luck.

06:05.250 --> 06:08.950
Good luck to you, making yourjudgments.

06:09.250 --> 06:12.650
And from the girls' line,
we need girl number

06:13.350 --> 06:15.350
00, Martha Johnstone.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.350
Toss to hands, liberty and cradle out, OK?

06:26.650 --> 06:29.050
I'm not wearing any panties.

06:31.350 --> 06:33.450
Ready? One, two.

06:36.450 --> 06:38.450
Liberty, ready?

06:50.450 --> 06:53.050
- Dude.
- Can he breathe?

06:59.550 --> 07:01.450
- Wow.
- Yeah.

07:01.550 --> 07:05.950
- It was the worst.
- Don't worry about this Amber situation.

07:06.250 --> 07:09.250
- It'll all work itself out in the end.
- Thanks, Pete.

07:09.550 --> 07:11.750
You'll laugh at this one day.
I'm laughing.

07:11.950 --> 07:14.950
Go at your own pace.
That's what it's there for.

07:17.150 --> 07:20.750
- Who goes there?
- It's me. It's Peter.

07:25.550 --> 07:28.350
'Tis about the matter of payment
for me membership.

07:28.550 --> 07:30.450
Steve be a touch short this month.

07:30.650 --> 07:32.650
That's all right.
Just pay me when you get the money.

07:32.850 --> 07:37.150
The dread pirate Steve be in no man's debt.
I'll make a barter with you.

07:37.450 --> 07:43.150
In exchange for your kindness,
I'll be splitting me buried treasure with you.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.450
Once I find it, that be.

07:45.550 --> 07:50.550
I'm flattered by the gesture, but
a couple of bucks here and there will be fine.

07:50.950 --> 07:52.950
Thanks, Peter.

07:53.050 --> 07:55.650
- I'll be on the StairMaster.
- OK, Steve.

07:55.850 --> 07:59.650
- Next time, maybe just say "hello".
- Gar.

08:05.850 --> 08:07.750
Hello.

08:07.950 --> 08:10.750
It's not my birthday till next month,
but terrific.

08:10.950 --> 08:13.050
I'm so sorry. Hi.

08:13.250 --> 08:17.050
I'm Katherine Veatch with Hawthorne Stone.

08:17.950 --> 08:20.250
- Your bank?
- Right. My bank.

08:20.450 --> 08:24.750
- You are very attractive for a banker.
- Thank you. I'm not a banker, I'm a lawyer.

08:25.050 --> 08:28.550
Really? What kind of law
are you involved in, pretty eyes?

08:28.750 --> 08:31.050
Sexual harassment, mostly.

08:31.250 --> 08:35.350
But I also handle real estate and tax law,
which is why I'm here.

08:35.650 --> 08:38.950
- This place is in default?
- No. You're in foreclosure.

08:39.150 --> 08:42.049
You were in default
when we sent you delinquency notices.

08:42.350 --> 08:45.350
- I thought those were just warnings.
- They were warnings.

08:45.550 --> 08:50.250
No one warned me. What happens now?
I make my payments out to somebody else?

08:50.550 --> 08:54.150
You have 30 days to pay the balance
of your mortgage, or you lose your gym.

08:54.450 --> 08:57.850
Perfect. What's the damage?
What do I owe you?

08:58.050 --> 08:59.750
$50,000.

09:01.950 --> 09:06.150
Personal cheque gonna be OK? Might have
to wait till the end of the month to cash her?

09:06.350 --> 09:10.750
I do have to switch some funds. The charity
I like to work with is gonna take a hit.

09:11.050 --> 09:14.350
Mr La Fleur, I can assure you
this is a very serious situation.

09:14.650 --> 09:18.250
Yeah.
This is extremely serious, Mrs Veatch.

09:18.450 --> 09:23.550
It's Ms. I'll need to review all of your financial
statements and assess any tax liabilities.

09:23.950 --> 09:26.750
Absolutely.
I don't know how you say "Ms" for "Mr",

09:26.950 --> 09:29.650
but if there was a "Ms Mr",
I'm a Ms as well.

09:30.450 --> 09:34.550
You do keep financial records?
Invoices, revenue reports, taxable income.

09:34.850 --> 09:37.950
You kidding? I got a closet full of 'em.
I call 'em keepers.

09:42.850 --> 09:46.550
- Problem is I've never really filed them.
- No kidding.

09:46.850 --> 09:50.150
Just out of curiosity,
who would want to buy this place anyway?

09:50.350 --> 09:52.950
Come on, squeeze it, squeeze it.

09:53.250 --> 09:57.050
Yeah, come on, come on. Get it up.

09:57.250 --> 10:00.550
One more, bitch. One more, bitch.

10:00.850 --> 10:03.550
Yeah. Yeah.

10:03.750 --> 10:06.150
- Now you're my bitch.
- Yeah.

10:08.450 --> 10:10.850
Yeah, baby.

10:11.050 --> 10:14.650
Involuntary spasm.
Look at the show. Enjoy the show.

10:16.850 --> 10:20.750
This a bad time? I could come back.
Looks like some real dude sweat going on.

10:21.050 --> 10:25.250
Add three pounds to the scales in the
women's locker room before you go home.

10:25.550 --> 10:30.150
Refreshment?
I've got protein paste, carb laxative...

10:30.950 --> 10:34.450
- Suffocated kumquat, perhaps?
- I'm trying to cut down on those.

10:34.650 --> 10:37.150
- They're good. They are good.
- Know what you mean.

10:37.450 --> 10:39.450
Walk with me.

10:42.850 --> 10:46.150
Hey, Brianna.
Cellulite seminar tomorrow, 0600.

10:46.850 --> 10:50.250
Nice job, Susie.
You call that a sit-up?

10:50.550 --> 10:52.950
Don't slack, Trevor.
I'm watching you.

10:53.150 --> 10:54.750
There's a good energy in the gym.

10:54.950 --> 10:56.850
Let me guess why you're here, Pete.

10:57.050 --> 10:59.850
Because I bought out
the second mortgage on your gym.

11:00.050 --> 11:04.850
You've got 30 days to make $50,000,
or your gym becomes my gym.

11:05.150 --> 11:07.250
I know we've had our differences...

11:07.450 --> 11:10.950
Is that what you call
sleeping with three of my female trainers?

11:11.150 --> 11:12.150
It was one night.

11:12.350 --> 11:15.750
Or the strip-o-gram you sent me
for the Globo Gym one-year anniversary?

11:15.950 --> 11:19.150
- It was meant to be congratulatory.
- It was also a man.

11:19.450 --> 11:21.650
Let's not get hung up on details.

11:21.850 --> 11:24.450
- We're both professionals.
- Really?

11:24.550 --> 11:27.550
Last I heard, my gym makes money.
Yours doesn't.

11:27.750 --> 11:31.350
My gym's worth over $4 million.
Your gym isn't worth four.

11:31.650 --> 11:35.850
I have shareholders.
You haven't even got cupholders.

11:36.150 --> 11:38.350
- Why would I want cupholders?
- The point is

11:38.550 --> 11:41.450
Globo Gym is a beacon
of human physical perfection.

11:41.650 --> 11:43.650
A benchmark in the fitness community.

11:43.850 --> 11:48.650
Your "gym" is a skid mark
on the underpants of society.

11:48.950 --> 11:53.350
See, Peter, I wasn't born
expecting the world to do me any favours.

11:53.650 --> 11:56.650
I earned this body
and I built this temple

11:56.850 --> 12:00.350
out of nothing more than
a little can-do attitude and elbow grease.

12:00.650 --> 12:03.350
And a large inheritance
from my father, Earl Goodman.

12:03.550 --> 12:09.450
So if I choose to level Average Joe's to build
a parking structure for my members, so be it.

12:09.750 --> 12:11.850
There's nothing you can do about it.

12:12.050 --> 12:16.950
In 30 days, I'll be bulldozing that shit-heap
you call a gym into permanent nothingness.

12:17.250 --> 12:22.350
I can only hope that you, and the mongrel
race that comprise your membership,

12:22.750 --> 12:25.350
are inside it when I do.

12:26.050 --> 12:28.250
Show Mr La Fleur out.

12:28.450 --> 12:30.450
Turn it up high, Reggie.

12:31.850 --> 12:33.850
I wanna burn.

12:35.850 --> 12:40.550
So that's the deal. We got 30 days
to raise $50,000, or Average Joe's is history.

12:40.850 --> 12:43.250
I got ten minutes.
I'll open it up to some Q&A.

12:44.750 --> 12:48.350
No need to raise your hands,
it's an open forum. OK, Owen, kick us off.

12:48.550 --> 12:52.050
Yes, Peter,
- and I'm just spitballing here -

12:52.350 --> 12:56.850
but why don't we pay it off
in Canadian dollars and save some money?

12:57.150 --> 13:01.150
Just so you know, if that's a route
you want to follow, it's 50,000 American.

13:01.350 --> 13:04.550
It would be 70,000, roughly,
Canadian dollars.

13:04.850 --> 13:09.750
- How are we gonna come up with $120,000?
- Owen, you don't add them together.

13:10.050 --> 13:14.150
Technically, Peter, I'm sorry to say this,
but it's more like $73,313...

13:14.450 --> 13:17.950
It doesn't matter. We can't come up
with $50,000. We're screwed.

13:18.150 --> 13:19.850
Gar.

13:20.050 --> 13:25.250
- It's an insurmountable amount of money.
- No, it's not insurmountable. Come on.

13:25.750 --> 13:28.350
We can'tjust sit back
and let Globo Gym take us over.

13:28.650 --> 13:31.550
Average Joe's is too important.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.950
Where do you go
when your wife changes the locks?

13:34.150 --> 13:36.050
- Average Joe's.
- Right.

13:36.250 --> 13:39.950
Dwight, Owen, what will you do
if Joe's goes under? Work at the airport?

13:40.150 --> 13:43.950
- I ain't working at no airport again.
- No. Cos you hated it.

13:44.250 --> 13:48.350
And, Steve, where do you go
to do whatever it is that you do?

13:48.650 --> 13:52.850
- Gar. Joe's be the only place for Steve.
- Gar. You're right.

13:53.550 --> 13:57.750
Do you see? There's no way I can go
back to working out at my high school.

13:58.050 --> 14:01.650
They'd laugh at me there.
Lock me in lockers, make me eat clay.

14:01.850 --> 14:04.650
But not here, not at Joe's.

14:04.850 --> 14:09.550
I need this place.
You guys need this place. Come on.

14:12.250 --> 14:15.050
I got it. I know how we can raise the money.

14:15.350 --> 14:17.850
- How?
- Car wash.

14:34.350 --> 14:37.750
What are the chances?
Same day, right across the street?

14:38.050 --> 14:39.850
The girls beat us fair and square.

14:40.150 --> 14:45.850
I am gonna be a gentleman about it and
congratulate every one of them, personally.

14:46.150 --> 14:50.650
Guys. Not to be a nay-sayer or anything,
but the only customer we've had

14:50.950 --> 14:55.250
is that weird guy
who keeps paying Justin to wash his truck.

15:00.350 --> 15:05.150
That's it, boy.
Get in there nice and deep, like.

15:07.650 --> 15:10.550
- That's not good.
- Gar. This sucks.

15:22.050 --> 15:24.950
Relax, Justin, it's just a cutout.

15:25.950 --> 15:29.250
At Globo Gym,
we're better than you and we know it.

15:29.550 --> 15:32.350
Sign up now.

15:32.550 --> 15:34.650
Do you smell that fitness? I do.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.250
Rock it and shock it, baby.

15:37.450 --> 15:39.350
You gotta burn it to earn it.

15:39.550 --> 15:43.350
- What's in the envelope?
- Free 30-day memberships to Globo Gym.

15:43.650 --> 15:47.250
- Cool.
- It's ajoke. He sent it to us as an insult.

15:47.450 --> 15:51.350
Maybe we could sell 'em for cash
cos the car wash cost us money.

15:51.650 --> 15:54.050
- We're further away from saving this place?
- Yes.

15:54.250 --> 15:56.750
- We'll never raise enough money.
- This blows.

15:56.950 --> 15:58.850
Guys, I know this is tough to take,

15:59.050 --> 16:02.950
but if an impromptu car wash
doesn't raise us the $50,000 we need,

16:03.250 --> 16:05.250
I guess itjust isn't in the cards.

16:05.450 --> 16:11.550
Trust me here. If there was any way in
the world we could raise $50,000 in 30 days,

16:11.850 --> 16:14.150
short of robbing a bank, I'd do it.

16:14.350 --> 16:16.450
We could sell blood and semen.

16:16.650 --> 16:18.450
What? Not mixed together.

16:18.650 --> 16:20.750
Guys, I love the enthusiasm,

16:20.950 --> 16:24.250
I love the energy here,
but we're looking at this the wrong way.

16:24.450 --> 16:27.050
Let's celebrate the good times
that was Joe's.

16:27.350 --> 16:30.550
We gotta start looking
at this Irish-wake style.

16:33.650 --> 16:37.450
Let me be the first
to say goodbye to Average Joe's.

16:37.750 --> 16:41.650
We gave it a hell of a run, guys.
Now let's try to have some fun.

16:41.850 --> 16:45.150
I'm gonna put on "The Thong Song",
and we'll tear this place apart.

16:45.450 --> 16:47.650
Wait, wait. Peter. Peter.

16:48.450 --> 16:50.550
We could play dodgeball.

16:50.750 --> 16:55.250
That's very nice, Gordon, but everyone's
tired. Playing a game isn't gonna help.

16:55.550 --> 17:01.050
There's a tournament in Las Vegas.
I feel so dumb I didn't think about it before.

17:01.350 --> 17:04.150
I read about
the Las Vegas International Dodgeball Open

17:04.450 --> 17:06.550
<i>every year in Obscure Sports Quarterly.</i>

17:06.750 --> 17:09.250
Of course. That's a totally common thing.

17:09.450 --> 17:13.550
The best part is it's open to any team
that wins a regional qualifying match.

17:13.750 --> 17:19.250
- How is dodgeball gonna get us the $50,000?
- They have a cash prize for the winner.

17:19.650 --> 17:22.550
- How much?
- $50,000.

17:22.750 --> 17:25.750
Guys, we are not gonna get $50,000
for playing dodgeball.

17:25.950 --> 17:28.950
- Why not?
- None of us know how to play dodgeball.

17:29.250 --> 17:33.650
I do. We played it in PE last year.
They showed us this film about it.

17:33.950 --> 17:37.150
- Can you get your hands on that film?
- Sure, I guess.

17:37.350 --> 17:39.950
Can we please try to be serious
here for one second?

17:40.050 --> 17:45.250
You said anything we could do to raise
the money. This is that anything. This is it.

17:45.450 --> 17:48.750
Come on, show of hands.
Who wants to play dodgeball?

17:49.650 --> 17:51.950
Come on.

17:54.550 --> 17:56.950
Come on, Pete.

17:58.150 --> 18:01.250
You guys had me at blood and semen.
Come here.

18:04.850 --> 18:07.950
You want it, don't you, fat boy?

18:08.250 --> 18:10.150
You want that doughnut.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.950
Go ahead and have a bite.

18:13.150 --> 18:16.950
Just a little bite.
One little bite won't hurt you.

18:22.550 --> 18:24.350
Momma.

18:25.150 --> 18:29.850
- Sir, Katherine Veatch is here to see you.
- Give me 30 seconds and send her in.

18:30.150 --> 18:31.550
Yes, sir.

18:47.150 --> 18:49.150
Thank you.

18:54.350 --> 18:58.450
Hello, Katherine. Good to see you.
I didn't know you were dropping by.

18:58.650 --> 19:02.050
- You asked me to come over.
- Did I?

19:03.450 --> 19:06.150
Are you reading the dictionary?

19:07.950 --> 19:11.450
You caught me. I like to break
a mental sweat too. Grab a chair.

19:11.750 --> 19:17.650
So, I trust everything's going swimmingly
with our acquisition of Average Joe's?

19:17.950 --> 19:22.550
So far, yeah. There's a lot to do over there,
so I should probably get back.

19:22.850 --> 19:26.650
- That is a really interesting painting.
- Thank you.

19:26.950 --> 19:32.150
Yeah, that's me, taking the bull by the horns.
It's how I handle my business.

19:32.450 --> 19:34.450
It's a metaphor.

19:34.650 --> 19:38.650
- I get it.
- But that actually happened, though.

19:38.950 --> 19:43.850
Anyway, we're a pretty tight-knit tribe here,
but there's always room for one more squaw.

19:44.150 --> 19:48.150
So, please, whatever you do,
don't think of me as your boss.

19:48.450 --> 19:50.850
- I don't.
- I don't want to get into a formal thing.

19:51.050 --> 19:53.050
I'm White, you know.

19:53.250 --> 19:55.050
W- h-i-t.

19:57.050 --> 19:58.450
E.

19:58.650 --> 20:01.250
Thanks, Mr Goodman,
but I'm contracted by the bank.

20:01.450 --> 20:03.450
They just assigned me to your account.

20:03.650 --> 20:09.450
Right, well. You work for the bank. Bank
works for me so, ipso fact, I'm your boss.

20:09.750 --> 20:15.750
Point is, I would love to see your pretty
little bone structure around here some more.

20:16.150 --> 20:18.150
There's no reason we need to be shackled

20:18.350 --> 20:22.450
by the strictures of
the employee-employer relationship.

20:22.750 --> 20:25.150
Unless you're into that sort of thing.

20:25.350 --> 20:28.050
In which case,
I got some shackles in the back.

20:28.250 --> 20:31.750
I'm just kidding.
But seriously, I've got 'em.

20:31.950 --> 20:34.550
I'm just doing my job, Mr Goodman.

20:34.850 --> 20:40.050
In fact, I actually prefer it over there.

20:40.250 --> 20:43.950
Really? You like it with those freaks
over there in Loser-Town?

20:44.150 --> 20:47.250
They're not freaks.
They're people, just like you and me.

20:48.850 --> 20:50.950
People?

20:51.150 --> 20:53.550
"People, just like you and me. "
Oh, man.

20:53.750 --> 20:57.450
That is what I love about you, Kate.
You've got a "personality".

20:58.550 --> 21:05.550
That is rich. A real sauciness
that I find extremely attractive.

21:07.850 --> 21:10.050
We should mate.

21:10.250 --> 21:11.950
- What?
- Date.

21:12.150 --> 21:15.150
We should date some time. Socially.
Go out and kick it.

21:17.150 --> 21:19.050
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine.

21:19.250 --> 21:22.450
I just threw up in my mouth a little bit.

21:23.750 --> 21:26.950
In some cultures, they only eat vomit.

21:27.150 --> 21:30.850
I never been there,
but I read about it in a book.

21:31.150 --> 21:34.650
I'm sorry, Mr Goodman.
I don't date clients.

21:36.550 --> 21:38.250
I get it.

21:38.450 --> 21:41.850
Don't crap where you eat. I understand.

21:42.050 --> 21:45.750
Me'Shell.
Please escort Ms Veatch out.

21:47.550 --> 21:51.550
And, Katherine, make sure
my acquisition of that gym goes smoothly.

21:51.850 --> 21:54.950
They're up to something over there.
I can smell it.

22:02.350 --> 22:07.950
Ûber-American Instructional films,
teaching America's youth since 1938.

22:15.050 --> 22:16.850
Hey, there, Timmy.

22:16.950 --> 22:20.550
Holy mackerel, mister.
You scared the jeepers out of me.

22:20.850 --> 22:24.550
How'd you like to take a break
from that fine lead-based paint,

22:24.850 --> 22:26.150
and learn about dodgeball?

22:26.250 --> 22:28.050
Boy, would I.

22:32.050 --> 22:35.250
- Where am I, mister?
- You're in a Chinese opium den, Timmy.

22:35.550 --> 22:38.850
This is where dodgeball
was invented in the 15th century,

22:39.050 --> 22:41.350
by opium-addicted Chinamen.

22:41.550 --> 22:44.850
Back then, the Chinamen threw
severed human heads at each another

22:45.150 --> 22:48.350
instead of the ADAA-approved balls
we use today.

22:51.050 --> 22:52.050
ADAA?

22:52.250 --> 22:55.850
That's the American Dodgeball
Association of America.

22:56.050 --> 23:01.350
Dodgeball is played with six players
on each team, and six rubber balls.

23:01.750 --> 23:04.850
The object of the game
is to eliminate the opposing players.

23:05.050 --> 23:09.350
Once all the players on one team are
eliminated, the opposing team wins.

23:09.650 --> 23:13.550
Wow. I can't wait
to get the fellas together and play.

23:15.650 --> 23:18.450
Hang on a second there, sport.

23:18.750 --> 23:21.650
- Patches O'Houlihan.
- That's right, Timmy.

23:21.850 --> 23:27.650
Patches O'Houlihan. Seven-time ADAA
All-Star is here to take you the rest of the way.

23:27.950 --> 23:31.450
- Jeepers. Really?
- You betcha, champ.

23:32.050 --> 23:35.950
If you catch a ball that's thrown at you
before it hits the ground,

23:36.250 --> 23:39.550
the player who threw that ball is out,
not you.

23:39.750 --> 23:44.350
Plus, another player from your team
gets to come back into the game.

23:44.650 --> 23:48.050
- It's a two-player swing.
- Thanks, Patches.

23:48.350 --> 23:51.050
I can't wait to start my own team at school.

23:51.250 --> 23:53.250
Attaboy, Tiger.

23:53.450 --> 23:58.850
But remember, dodgeball is a sport
of violence, exclusion and degradation.

23:59.150 --> 24:02.150
So, when you're picking players
in gym class,

24:02.350 --> 24:06.350
remember to pick the bigger,
stronger kids for your team.

24:06.650 --> 24:12.050
That way, you can all gang up
on the weaker ones, like Winston here.

24:17.250 --> 24:20.050
Nice one, son.
You'll be an all-star yet.

24:20.350 --> 24:23.750
Just remember the five Ds of dodgeball.

24:23.950 --> 24:26.650
Dodge, duck, dip, dive and

24:26.850 --> 24:28.350
dodge.

24:28.550 --> 24:31.450
Till next time.
This is Patches O'Houlihan,

24:31.650 --> 24:36.150
saying, "Take care of your balls
and they'll take care of you. "

24:38.050 --> 24:40.750
OK, guys. Any questions? Great.

24:40.950 --> 24:45.650
I signed us up for the sub-regional qualifier
tomorrow at the Waldorf rec centre.

24:45.950 --> 24:47.750
But we haven't even practised yet.

24:47.950 --> 24:51.650
We have to qualify for the Vegas Open.
Tomorrow's regional's our last chance.

24:51.950 --> 24:57.150
Everyone, just relax. I've always found
the best way to learn a sport is by playing it.

24:57.450 --> 25:00.150
If anyone needs me,
I'll be in my office doing Mad Libs.

25:00.350 --> 25:02.450
Thanks, Peter. Appreciate that a lot.

25:02.650 --> 25:04.450
OK, I think everybody knows...

25:08.050 --> 25:11.950
- Don't you have an office of your own?
- Yes, I do have an office.

25:12.250 --> 25:15.050
A very nice office
with a view and air-conditioning.

25:15.250 --> 25:18.350
- Rub it in.
- What I don't have in my office is a closet

25:18.550 --> 25:23.350
of 30 years of financial transactions,
devoid of any filing system known to man.

25:23.750 --> 25:27.550
Hard to believe I only got a semester
ofjunior college under my belt.

25:27.750 --> 25:32.450
Do you realise you haven't collected
any membership fees in 13 months?

25:32.750 --> 25:36.650
I'm curious. Is it strictly apathy,
or do you really not have a goal in life?

25:36.950 --> 25:40.450
I found that if you have a goal,
you might not reach it.

25:40.750 --> 25:44.250
But if you don't have one,
then you are never disappointed.

25:44.450 --> 25:48.750
I gotta tell you, it feels phenomenal.

25:49.050 --> 25:52.250
I guess that makes sense,
in a really sad way.

25:52.450 --> 25:55.050
Sad? You wanna know what's sad?

25:55.250 --> 25:57.950
Six grown men playing dodgeball.

25:58.650 --> 26:02.550
Since I'm here, I'm gonna go ahead
and do some abs, go shock it up.

26:02.850 --> 26:06.450
I like to work out all the time
for this kind of sporting event.

26:06.650 --> 26:09.350
Gotta be limber and loose.
That's the only way to play.

26:09.550 --> 26:13.950
Hey, you guys take vitamins?
I take vitamins all the time...

26:16.550 --> 26:18.850
Dodgeball, eh?

26:19.050 --> 26:23.850
If Peter La Fleur thinks a few
red rubber balls can save his sorry gym,

26:24.150 --> 26:26.950
he's in for quite a surprise.

26:35.350 --> 26:38.150
- Sorry I'm late, guys.
- Hey, Pete.

26:38.350 --> 26:42.550
- Bad morning, boss?
- They usually follow good nights, Dwight.

26:42.850 --> 26:44.850
- Hey, Gord, your family's here.
- Where?

26:45.050 --> 26:47.250
- Right over there.
- Great.

26:47.450 --> 26:50.650
She knows I don't like it
when she watches me. I get all nervous.

26:50.850 --> 26:53.650
- Kids take after you.
- Yeah. She's their stepmother.

26:53.850 --> 26:56.750
I remarried three years ago.
An Internet mail-order thing.

26:57.050 --> 27:01.050
- How's that working out for you?
- Really great. Really great.

27:01.250 --> 27:02.650
Hey, honey.

27:04.550 --> 27:07.450
L for love. Good times.

27:07.650 --> 27:09.650
L for love? That doesn't mean love...

27:09.850 --> 27:12.250
People have different translations
for things.

27:12.450 --> 27:16.750
That's a special bond that you have with
your mail-order wife. I think that's nice.

27:17.050 --> 27:19.150
- How many teams are in this qualifier?
- Two.

27:19.350 --> 27:21.650
If we beat this team,
we're in the Vegas Open?

27:21.850 --> 27:23.650
- Yeah.
- That seems pretty simple.

27:23.850 --> 27:28.650
- Who's the other team?
- I have it right here. Just a sec.

27:28.950 --> 27:33.350
- Troop 417.
- Christ. We're playing Boy Scouts?

27:34.150 --> 27:35.350
Not quite.

27:44.050 --> 27:45.550
Bollocks.

27:51.250 --> 27:53.250
Troop 417, ready.

27:53.450 --> 27:55.050
Average Joe's, ready.

27:56.950 --> 27:58.550
Set. Dodgeball.

28:27.050 --> 28:29.350
I'm gonna send you to hell.

28:39.250 --> 28:44.250
- I'm really sorry. Are you all right?
- Why would you hit a girl? Why?

28:44.650 --> 28:46.550
I am so sorry. Are you OK?

28:48.950 --> 28:51.250
Winner - Troop 417.

28:51.450 --> 28:53.450
In your face.

28:53.650 --> 28:57.850
You're adopted.
Your parents don't even love you.

29:00.450 --> 29:06.150
And now, without further ado,
it gives me great pleasure to award...

29:09.250 --> 29:12.350
I'm sorry.
We have a bit of a problem here.

29:13.150 --> 29:16.250
Unfortunately for Troop 417,

29:16.550 --> 29:20.350
during the ADAA-required
random drug screening,

29:20.550 --> 29:25.750
one of your player's urine tested positive
for three separate types of anabolic steroids,

29:26.150 --> 29:29.850
and a low-grade beaver tranquilliser.

29:30.050 --> 29:34.050
I'm afraid, by rule,
your team must be disqualified.

29:34.850 --> 29:37.050
Goddamn you, Bernice.

29:37.850 --> 29:41.150
By the power vested in me,
I declare the winner of this year's

29:41.450 --> 29:46.650
Dodgeball Regional Qualifying Tournament
and Grammar Jamboree to be

29:46.950 --> 29:48.750
Average Joe's Gym.

29:51.650 --> 29:53.350
You lied.

30:00.450 --> 30:05.350
All I'm saying to you, Kate, is that you can
admit the real reason why you showed up.

30:05.650 --> 30:09.950
I was in the neighbourhood and
I thought you could use a cheering section.

30:10.250 --> 30:13.750
Kate, if you wannajoin the team,
all you have to do is ask.

30:13.950 --> 30:16.650
Thank you, Peter. I don't.

30:17.750 --> 30:20.450
It is obvious that you dig me.

30:20.650 --> 30:22.550
- You're hooked on La Fleur.
- God.

30:22.750 --> 30:27.550
I've been through this many times. I'm sorry.
You can't stay away from me. I'm so stupid.

30:27.850 --> 30:33.650
I'll admit that, in spite of yourself, you have
brief moments where you're not completely...

30:35.550 --> 30:38.450
What? I'm not completely what?

30:38.650 --> 30:41.350
Pathetic.

30:42.150 --> 30:45.150
Hey, White. I didn't think
that Nazi camp got out until eight.

30:45.350 --> 30:49.650
- Did you decide to skip arts and crafts?
- Yes, I did.

30:49.950 --> 30:53.850
Hello, Kate.
I wasn't aware I was paying you to socialise.

30:54.150 --> 31:00.650
- You're not. I'm off the clock.
- Isn't it "convenient" for you, and the clock?

31:00.950 --> 31:04.850
I dropped by to congratulate you
on your victory by disqualification

31:05.150 --> 31:09.050
and introduce you to the team that
will win the Las Vegas Dodgeball Open.

31:09.350 --> 31:10.950
My team.

31:12.250 --> 31:14.650
Allow me the pleasure of introducing you to

31:14.850 --> 31:16.850
Blade.

31:17.850 --> 31:19.850
Laser.

31:21.050 --> 31:23.150
Blazer.

31:23.250 --> 31:26.650
<i>I've believe you've met
my fitness consigliere, Me'Shell.</i>

31:26.950 --> 31:31.350
- We met.
- And I almost forgot our last player.

31:31.650 --> 31:36.350
Meet Fran Stalinofskivitchdavitovichski.

31:46.750 --> 31:50.750
In her home country of Romanovia,
dodgeball is the national sport.

31:51.050 --> 31:55.250
Her nuclear power plant's team won
the championship five years running,

31:55.550 --> 32:00.550
which makes her the deadliest woman
on earth with a dodgeball.

32:00.850 --> 32:02.550
Ball me, Blazer.

32:03.050 --> 32:05.350
Show them, Fran.

32:09.750 --> 32:12.450
That's just her change-up.

32:12.750 --> 32:14.650
End of demo.

32:14.750 --> 32:17.550
We are the Globo Gym Purple Cobras

32:17.850 --> 32:21.450
and we will, we will rock you.

32:25.950 --> 32:28.750
I think that guy might really be dead.

32:30.550 --> 32:34.650
Wait a minute. How can you be
entered in the Las Vegas Open?

32:34.950 --> 32:37.150
You didn't win a regional qualifying match.

32:37.350 --> 32:40.450
Oh, my God. We never even won
a regional qualifying match.

32:40.650 --> 32:42.650
Yeah. Now I remember.

32:42.850 --> 32:46.450
The dodgeball chancellor's
an extremely personal friend of mine.

32:46.750 --> 32:49.850
I helped him shed some unwanted poundage
before beach season.

32:50.050 --> 32:52.650
So close your rule book
on that one, Poindextor.

32:52.850 --> 32:57.250
White, we didn't come here to "rumble".
We came here to celebrate as a team.

32:57.550 --> 33:00.550
There's plenty of bar here
for you and the Globo-nauts.

33:00.750 --> 33:02.450
Team?

33:02.650 --> 33:06.450
What team?
Your best player thinks he's a pirate.

33:10.050 --> 33:13.350
First of all, he is way more
of a pirate than you will ever be.

33:13.550 --> 33:18.750
Secondly, we don't know who our best player
is yet. We've only had one game.

33:19.050 --> 33:23.650
- It could be any one of us at this point.
- Go ahead, make yourjokes, Mr

33:23.950 --> 33:25.950
Jokey... Joke-maker.

33:26.150 --> 33:28.950
But let me hit you with
some knowledge. Quit now.

33:29.150 --> 33:34.150
Save yourself the embarrassment of losing
with these losers in Las Vegas, La Fleur.

33:34.450 --> 33:37.550
Alliteration aside,
I'll take my chances in the tournament.

33:37.750 --> 33:42.150
- Yeah, you will take your chances.
- I know. I just said that.

33:42.450 --> 33:45.450
- I know you did.
- I'm not sure where you're going with this.

33:45.750 --> 33:49.050
<i>- I'm not sure where you're going with this.
- That's what I said.</i>

33:49.250 --> 33:53.350
- That's what I'm saying to you.
- All right.

33:53.650 --> 33:55.150
Touché.

33:57.950 --> 34:00.850
We're gonna split,
but we'll see you at the tournament.

34:01.050 --> 34:05.850
And, La Fleur, best bring your bib
cos it's gonna get messy.

34:10.750 --> 34:12.750
Are you all right? You OK?

34:15.050 --> 34:17.150
Let's bounce. Cobras.

34:20.650 --> 34:26.449
OK, guys, let's just get ourselves cleaned up
and head on home, all right?

34:33.250 --> 34:34.449
Hey, you.

34:34.650 --> 34:39.250
That was the worst damn display
of dodgeball I've seen in 40 years.

34:39.550 --> 34:42.850
You want a dodgeball victory,
you've gotta grab it by its haunches

34:43.050 --> 34:46.350
and hump it into submission.
That's the only way.

34:46.550 --> 34:49.750
OK, crazy guy. I'm gonna go home now.

34:50.050 --> 34:53.050
I ain't crazy and I ain't a guy.

34:54.350 --> 34:57.150
The name's Patches O'Houlihan.

34:57.350 --> 34:59.950
I'm your new coach.

35:00.150 --> 35:02.950
Patches O'Houlihan?
The guy from the dodgeball film?

35:03.150 --> 35:05.850
- Yeah. He said he wants to coach us.
- You said yes?

35:06.050 --> 35:09.950
I figured the steady hand of a seasoned
dodgeball coach could only benefit us.

35:10.250 --> 35:13.250
A'iight.
But he's not weird or anything, is he?

35:13.450 --> 35:16.150
No. No, he's totally normal.

35:27.350 --> 35:30.650
I love the smell of queef in the morning.

35:30.950 --> 35:32.950
I mean normal for us.

35:33.550 --> 35:35.350
Line up, ladies.

35:35.450 --> 35:37.750
- What does he mean, line up?
- Now.

35:40.950 --> 35:44.650
If you're gonna learn to be
true dodgeballers,

35:44.850 --> 35:48.550
then you've got to learn
the five Ds of dodgeball:

35:48.850 --> 35:51.750
dodge, duck, dip, dive and dodge.

35:51.950 --> 35:57.750
If you master the five Ds,
no amount of balls on earth can hit you.

35:59.250 --> 36:02.350
- Queer bait, go ahead.
- Me, or...

36:02.650 --> 36:07.350
Yeah, shouldn't we learn by dodging balls
that are thrown at us, or...

36:07.650 --> 36:10.850
That's what this sack of wrenches is for.

36:16.250 --> 36:18.850
If you can dodge a wrench,
you can dodge a ball.

36:18.950 --> 36:20.950
What?

36:30.850 --> 36:32.550
Any other questions?

36:32.750 --> 36:34.850
My God.

36:35.050 --> 36:39.950
Yeah. Patches, are you sure
that this is completely necessary?

36:40.250 --> 36:42.650
Necessary?

36:42.850 --> 36:46.950
- Is it necessary for me to drink my urine?
- Probably not.

36:47.250 --> 36:52.050
No. But I do it anyway
because it's sterile and I like the taste.

36:52.350 --> 36:53.750
OK.

36:53.850 --> 36:59.050
If you're leading this squad, La Fleur, you've
got to learn to do the dance in the dark.

37:00.150 --> 37:02.050
Here, put that on.

37:02.250 --> 37:04.450
All right, ladies, buckle up.

37:04.950 --> 37:06.250
It's showtime.

37:09.150 --> 37:11.550
Dodge, duck, dip. Dive.

37:13.250 --> 37:14.750
Dodge.

37:14.950 --> 37:16.750
Dive.

37:16.950 --> 37:20.050
Dip. Dive. Dodge.

37:20.950 --> 37:25.450
I've got three weeks to whip you
suck-ass failure junkies into shape.

37:25.650 --> 37:29.050
Come on. I get better runs in my shorts.

37:29.850 --> 37:34.750
Catch a ball, one of their guys goes out.
One of our guys comes back in.

37:35.050 --> 37:38.150
That's the way you hurt 'em.
That's the way you win.

37:41.050 --> 37:42.950
Let's go. A little hustle here.

37:50.150 --> 37:51.750
That's really good, Peter.

37:55.650 --> 37:59.750
Come on. Only 19 miles to go.

38:03.650 --> 38:04.850
Attaboy.

38:06.750 --> 38:08.650
Next man.

38:08.850 --> 38:11.950
Good luck to you, Gordon.
Remember it's 90% mental.

38:12.150 --> 38:13.050
Okey-dokey.

38:13.250 --> 38:17.350
If you can dodge traffic,
you can dodge a ball.

38:21.150 --> 38:23.050
You got it, Gord.

38:28.050 --> 38:31.050
- I'm fine. I'm OK.
- OK, there.

38:38.050 --> 38:40.050
- Man.
- Wake up, Smithy.

38:45.950 --> 38:50.150
Hell, son. You're about as useful
as a cock-flavoured lollipop.

38:51.050 --> 38:53.350
Quick feet, fast hands.

38:53.550 --> 38:55.450
Catch it and throw.

38:56.150 --> 39:00.850
Pick up the pace. What a bunch of females.

39:04.750 --> 39:07.550
Jesus. Gimme that.

39:08.950 --> 39:12.050
You couldn't hit water
if you fell out of a boat.

39:12.250 --> 39:15.050
Where's your killer instinct?
You gotta get angry.

39:15.250 --> 39:18.750
You gotta get mean.
That's the only way you can play.

39:19.650 --> 39:22.250
I guess I'm not really an angry person.

39:26.650 --> 39:29.250
Are you angry now?

39:29.450 --> 39:34.150
- Breathe it out.
- Come on, let's get going here.

39:41.850 --> 39:43.750
Little help?

39:52.950 --> 39:55.750
What? Eight years of softball.

39:55.950 --> 39:59.550
- Man, she gotta be a lesbian.
- She is not a lesbian.

39:59.750 --> 40:02.350
All I know is that dyke can play.

40:14.150 --> 40:16.150
Come on, come on.

40:16.350 --> 40:18.850
- Please.
- We need you. You're really good.

40:19.050 --> 40:20.950
Owen'll be team manager if you play.

40:21.150 --> 40:22.650
- I will?
- Shut up.

40:22.850 --> 40:25.650
Look, I find White Goodman creepy,
just like you do...

40:25.850 --> 40:28.150
All the more reason for you to join us.

40:28.350 --> 40:31.550
Come on, Kate.
Time to put your mouth where our balls are.

40:31.750 --> 40:35.850
Sorry, I can't. I'm under contract.
It'd be a conflict of interest.

40:36.550 --> 40:38.650
Suit yourself.

40:38.850 --> 40:42.450
All right, you heard Billie-Jean King.
No crying in the breast milk.

40:42.750 --> 40:44.850
We got plenty of work to do. Let's go.

40:48.750 --> 40:52.250
We punch the pizza dough down,
and it's time to sauce it up.

40:52.550 --> 40:54.550
Boy, is my mouth watering.

40:54.750 --> 40:58.050
You want to put a big dollop
of that tangy red on the dough,

40:58.250 --> 41:01.050
then use the cheese to shove it to the edge.

41:01.350 --> 41:03.350
Sir, I need you to take a look at...

41:03.450 --> 41:05.250
No. What...

41:05.450 --> 41:10.050
What...
What have I said about knocking?

41:10.350 --> 41:12.550
- Always knock.
- Sorry, sir.

41:12.750 --> 41:18.050
What is so important that you need to
interrupt me in my private reflection period?

41:18.850 --> 41:20.850
These.

41:24.950 --> 41:29.350
- They're getting better.
- Yes. I can see that, Me'Shell.

41:29.650 --> 41:33.950
I'm through playing games. It's time
to end this square dance once and for all.

41:34.250 --> 41:36.250
What about the girl? She can throw.

41:36.450 --> 41:40.350
I'll simply have to woo Kate
a bit sooner than nature intended.

41:40.650 --> 41:43.350
But rest assured, Me'Shell.

41:43.550 --> 41:48.850
There's no resisting when
White Goodman puts on his shiny shoes.

42:10.050 --> 42:12.150
- Who is it?
- It's White.

42:14.850 --> 42:17.650
- Surprise.
- White.

42:19.150 --> 42:21.950
What... What are you doing here?

42:22.250 --> 42:24.550
How do you know where I live?

42:24.750 --> 42:26.850
It's called the Freedom of Information Act.

42:27.050 --> 42:30.650
The hippies finally got something right.
Just kiddin'. Not really.

42:30.850 --> 42:34.450
Hey. I got some great news. Sit down.

42:37.550 --> 42:39.550
- What is it?
- You're fired.

42:39.750 --> 42:41.350
- I'm what?
- You're fired.

42:41.450 --> 42:45.150
I told the bank that you were stealing
and drinking on the job. They bought it.

42:45.450 --> 42:48.550
They signed some other
pencil pusher to my account.

42:48.750 --> 42:50.950
Why would you do that?

42:51.650 --> 42:54.250
I'm here to begin my courtship of you, Kate.

42:54.450 --> 42:57.350
- You fired me so I'd date you?
- Yuh-huh.

42:57.550 --> 43:00.250
You are a crazy little man.

43:00.450 --> 43:03.050
I know you've been hiding
some feelings for me.

43:03.250 --> 43:05.250
Yeah. Nausea.

43:05.450 --> 43:08.750
If you don't leave in two seconds,
you'll know how that feels.

43:10.650 --> 43:13.350
You like the freaky stuff, huh?
That's cool.

43:14.450 --> 43:16.250
I can be naughty, too.

43:17.950 --> 43:20.350
Real, freakin' naughty.

43:22.050 --> 43:23.950
- You a naughty freak?
- Need help leaving?

43:26.250 --> 43:27.850
This doesn't concern you, La Fleur.

43:27.950 --> 43:31.150
Not nearly as much as your hair does.
That's for sure.

43:31.450 --> 43:35.150
But I believe she asked you to leave.

43:37.250 --> 43:41.750
I get it. You caught the scent
of a lesser stag in your nostrils.

43:42.050 --> 43:46.350
Pity. I'll let you have
your little moment, La Fleur,

43:46.650 --> 43:53.750
cos after this tournament, your gym,
your life and your gal are gonna be mine.

43:54.150 --> 43:56.250
All mine.

43:56.950 --> 43:58.850
To be continued...

43:59.050 --> 44:01.750
You don't get to touch me, ever.

44:01.950 --> 44:04.250
OK, Romeo. Let me help you up.

44:04.450 --> 44:07.950
Get off me.
Don't you touch me.

44:10.250 --> 44:13.150
It is over between us, Kate.

44:13.350 --> 44:16.250
Nobody makes me bleed my own blood.
Nobody.

44:30.650 --> 44:33.950
- At least that wasn't weird.
- Yeah.

44:34.150 --> 44:36.950
- Do I smell cookies?
- Hey.

44:38.550 --> 44:40.850
Dear Barbara.

44:48.250 --> 44:50.150
I like unicorns.

44:52.950 --> 44:55.050
I know you said no to joining the team,

44:55.250 --> 44:58.950
but I'd like you to reconsider
as a personal favour to me.

44:59.250 --> 45:00.850
- Peter...
- Before you answer,

45:00.950 --> 45:03.450
you should know you'd have
your own changing room.

45:03.750 --> 45:05.850
- Really?
- Sort of.

45:07.150 --> 45:09.250
And there's also this.

45:10.250 --> 45:12.350
- OK, what's this?
- I overdid.

45:14.850 --> 45:18.350
Look at you. Two expired movie passes

45:18.650 --> 45:23.050
and a coupon for one free back rub
from Peter La Fleur.

45:23.350 --> 45:27.850
- Play your cards right, could be a full body.
- Will you just stop, please?

45:28.050 --> 45:31.850
I don't want your perk package.
I don't want your back rub.

45:32.150 --> 45:35.750
I just want to see White Goodman's face
when we win that tournament.

45:36.050 --> 45:38.250
- You're in?
- I'm in.

45:42.550 --> 45:47.250
Las Vegas. A city built of hot sand,
broken dreams and $5 lobster.

45:47.550 --> 45:51.150
A city where you can get a happy ending,
if you pay a little extra.

45:51.450 --> 45:54.650
A city home to a sporting event
greater than the World Cup,

45:54.850 --> 45:59.150
World Series and World War II combined.

45:59.450 --> 46:03.550
Live from Las Vegas, it's the Las Vegas
International Dodgeball Open

46:03.850 --> 46:06.550
here on ESPN8- the "Ocho" -

46:06.750 --> 46:11.250
bringing you the finest in seldom-seen sports
from around the globe since 1999.

46:11.550 --> 46:14.850
If it's almost a sport, we've got it here.

46:15.150 --> 46:20.650
Hello, everybody, and welcome to this year's
Las Vegas International Dodgeball Open

46:20.950 --> 46:24.150
brought to you exclusively
here on ESPN8- the "Ocho".

46:24.350 --> 46:27.950
We're coming to you live from
the Las Vegas University Learning Annex.

46:28.250 --> 46:29.950
My name is Cotton McKnight

46:30.150 --> 46:33.850
and with me, as always,
is my partner in crime, Pepper Brooks.

46:34.050 --> 46:35.850
Yeah. Cotton, hey.

46:36.050 --> 46:41.250
Everybody, 32 teams in play, that means
four wins is gonna get you in the final match,

46:41.650 --> 46:44.950
the fifth win getting you
the 50K that everyone's chasing.

46:45.150 --> 46:46.150
Cotton.

46:46.250 --> 46:51.350
There's an electricity in the air,
a palpable hue of anticipation.

46:51.750 --> 46:55.150
Immortality - five simple victories away.

46:55.350 --> 46:59.950
They've come from all over - Kathmandu
to Timbuktu, and all points in-between -

47:00.250 --> 47:04.550
to compete in the one
true human test - dodgeball.

47:05.550 --> 47:08.050
A reminder.
All players must be vaccinated

47:08.250 --> 47:12.350
for cholera, syphilis and shingles
before play begins.

47:12.650 --> 47:16.950
Again, dyslexic players
will not be allowed on the court.

47:17.250 --> 47:21.450
Team Blitzkrieg to the tournament floor
for a first-round match.

47:21.750 --> 47:24.950
Only ADAA balls will be used.

47:25.150 --> 47:28.850
Personal balls of any kind
are strictly prohibited.

47:29.150 --> 47:31.550
- Hey.
- Hey. What's in the box?

47:31.750 --> 47:36.150
Guys, I figured a real dodgeball team
needs real dodgeball uniforms.

47:36.450 --> 47:40.150
So I threw out those old ratty ones
and designed these myself.

47:40.450 --> 47:44.550
All right. Now we got our thing going on,
maybe we'll start smacking each other.

47:44.750 --> 47:46.750
I hope everything fits.

47:48.950 --> 47:51.450
- Wait.
- Nice.

47:51.650 --> 47:55.950
This isn't right.
This isn't what I ordered.

48:00.150 --> 48:03.750
- What's this?
- What the hell is that? This is screwed up.

48:04.750 --> 48:07.650
- What are we supposed to do now?
- Don't worry.

48:07.950 --> 48:10.050
- We'll play in what we've got on.
- We can't.

48:10.250 --> 48:12.850
ADAA rules require we wear
matching uniforms.

48:13.050 --> 48:17.050
I don't think they require
ass-less chaps, OK?

48:17.350 --> 48:22.350
Everybody, calm down. We've got plenty
of time to find other uniforms before we play.

48:22.650 --> 48:26.050
Ladies, we gotta get on the court
or we're gonna forfeit the game.

48:26.250 --> 48:29.950
Come on, let's go.
Let's see some movement. Chop-chop.

48:30.250 --> 48:32.150
I don't see any movement. Let's go.

48:42.750 --> 48:45.550
How about those dodgeball dancers, folks?

48:45.750 --> 48:49.450
- That is some good, clean, family fun, Cot.
- Right you are.

48:49.750 --> 48:52.150
Here comes Germany's Team Blitzkrieg.

48:52.350 --> 48:55.550
The reigning European champ
hopes to extend their empire here.

48:55.750 --> 48:57.750
Appeasement be damned.

48:57.950 --> 49:01.150
Here comes
the relatively unknown challengers,

49:01.450 --> 49:05.450
a regional qualifying team,
Average Joe's Gymnasium.

49:15.450 --> 49:17.550
My sweet Jesus.

49:18.650 --> 49:20.650
That's rad.

49:20.850 --> 49:23.550
Hey, asshole, you guys suck.

49:24.050 --> 49:26.550
Thank you. Nice to be in Vegas.

49:26.750 --> 49:29.250
Hi. We're all here and

49:29.450 --> 49:31.350
we are ready to play.

49:34.250 --> 49:36.650
- OK.
- OK.

49:38.650 --> 49:42.650
We get our first glimpse of the Average Joe's
squad, sporting unwieldy uniforms.

49:42.950 --> 49:45.650
I feel like I'm watching a Cher video.

49:45.850 --> 49:47.750
Average Joe's, ready.

49:47.950 --> 49:49.850
Blitzkrieg, ready.

49:49.950 --> 49:51.250
Dodgeball.

49:51.450 --> 49:56.050
And we're under way. Average Joe's
versus the heavily favoured German team.

49:56.350 --> 50:00.050
Of course, S&M gear first made
popular by the lyric poet, Sappho,

50:00.350 --> 50:03.250
- from the island of Lesbos.
- Clean hit. You're out.

50:03.450 --> 50:08.050
Leather and latex belong in the bedroom,
not on the dodgeball court.

50:08.350 --> 50:13.550
Where's that training?
Dodge, duck, dip, dive, dodge.

50:14.250 --> 50:18.550
Captain Peter La Fleur gets eliminated
and coach O'Houlihan is not happy.

50:26.150 --> 50:28.650
This Average Joe's team
doesn't look up to snuff.

50:30.050 --> 50:33.350
Midline infraction.
You went over the line, you're out.

50:33.550 --> 50:35.950
The Average Joe's catches a break there.

50:36.150 --> 50:39.550
The Germans still dominating
this Maginot Line-like defence.

50:39.850 --> 50:42.250
Good toss by the submissive out there.

50:42.450 --> 50:46.450
Just two players left for Joe...
Check that. Make it one.

50:46.750 --> 50:49.550
Looks like Average Joe's
might be heading home early.

50:50.150 --> 50:53.850
It's all up to the only player
without a Y-chromosome, Kate Veatch.

50:55.150 --> 50:57.150
What a throw.

50:57.350 --> 50:59.350
Hold your phone, she's got a cannon.

50:59.550 --> 51:01.150
Yes.

51:01.350 --> 51:05.450
- Come on, Kate.
- You're the only man out there. Give it to 'em.

51:05.650 --> 51:10.650
Germans have a two-one advantage.
Great catch. La Fleur's back in the game.

51:11.050 --> 51:15.450
How about that? A two-on-one switcheroo.
Now Joe's has the upper hand.

51:15.650 --> 51:17.550
- Great deflection.
- Take it to him.

51:17.750 --> 51:22.250
- He's ball-less now.
- He doesn't have any balls, Cotton.

51:22.550 --> 51:25.350
Winner. Average Joe's.

51:26.950 --> 51:29.350
My sweet dick, it's magic.

51:29.550 --> 51:30.750
Hey, all right.

51:30.950 --> 51:36.350
My. The Germans losing in the first round
and Average Joe's wins in a shocking upset.

51:36.650 --> 51:39.250
I feel shocked.

51:48.150 --> 51:50.050
Losers.

52:01.450 --> 52:04.250
You must be Daddy.

52:04.850 --> 52:08.950
Average Joe's has shocked the dodgeball
pundits and made it to tomorrow's round

52:09.150 --> 52:12.750
where we'll separate the wheat from the chaff,
the men from the boys,

52:13.050 --> 52:16.050
and the awkwardly feminine
from the possibly Canadian.

52:16.250 --> 52:19.350
Don't go anywhere, folks.
It's just getting exciting.

52:23.950 --> 52:27.350
- What the hell.
- That guy's a dickhead.

52:33.150 --> 52:35.650
You wanted to see me, Patches?

52:37.050 --> 52:40.650
You did good out there, real good.
You're a natural leader, La Fleur.

52:40.850 --> 52:43.750
Those men and that muff-diver believe in you.

52:44.050 --> 52:46.450
Kate's not a muff-diver.

52:48.350 --> 52:50.250
Hey. That's for you.

52:51.850 --> 52:54.950
- I can't accept this.
- You're a hell of a player, Peter.

52:55.150 --> 52:57.450
You earned it.

52:57.650 --> 53:02.350
I've got some hookers in my room.
What do you say we go celebrate? My treat.

53:02.650 --> 53:05.750
No, thanks, I'll just stick
with the scarf, but thank you.

53:06.050 --> 53:08.050
Suit yourself, queer.

53:18.350 --> 53:20.150
- Sorry.
- Justin?

53:20.250 --> 53:22.750
Amber.
Jeez Louise, what are you doing here?

53:22.950 --> 53:27.950
- The National Cheerleading Championships.
- Oh, yeah, the NCCs. That's so awesome.

53:28.350 --> 53:32.050
- We're in the finals tomorrow. And you?
- I'm in the dodgeball tournament.

53:32.250 --> 53:36.850
These are my team-mates,
Dwight, Ms Veatch and Gordon.

53:37.150 --> 53:39.250
This is Amber.

53:39.450 --> 53:41.550
Come on, I wanna ride the roller coaster.

53:41.750 --> 53:46.450
- Hey, Derek. Sweet 'do, man.
- Get bent, helmet. Let's go, Amber.

53:46.750 --> 53:52.150
- It was nice to see you. Good luck tomorrow.
- And also you. You look healthy... good.

53:53.250 --> 53:54.750
What?

53:54.850 --> 53:57.750
Don't worry about that guy, Justin.
He's a total jerk.

53:58.050 --> 54:01.350
He'll probably fall off the roller coaster
and break every bone.

54:01.550 --> 54:04.050
- Nice, Dwight.
- I'm just saying, it happens.

54:04.250 --> 54:06.750
My cousin Ray-Ray. Boop. Dead.

54:06.950 --> 54:08.050
Thanks, man.

54:12.750 --> 54:15.550
Let's huddle up here.
We've got some work to do.

54:15.750 --> 54:17.850
We got lucky in the first round.

54:18.050 --> 54:21.550
We caught those dirty Krauts napping,
but that won't happen again,

54:21.750 --> 54:25.750
so blow out the horse hockey
and remember what I taught you.

54:26.050 --> 54:32.250
Blockers in the centre, funnelling, aim low
and will someone catch a goddamned ball?

54:32.650 --> 54:37.150
It's like watching a bunch of retards
trying to fuck a doorknob out there.

54:37.450 --> 54:41.150
Get it together.
Let's play some dodgeball.

54:41.350 --> 54:43.250
Hands in.

54:43.450 --> 54:45.350
One, two, three, Joe's.

54:47.250 --> 54:49.350
- Average Joe's ready?
- Yes.

54:49.550 --> 54:51.650
Lumberjacks, ready?

54:51.850 --> 54:52.750
Dodgeball.

54:52.850 --> 54:56.350
Average Joe's has a tough job,
facing the Lumberjacks.

54:56.650 --> 55:00.050
These woodsmen probably haven't
even smelt a woman in eight months.

55:00.250 --> 55:02.950
They must masturbate a lot, Cotton.

55:03.150 --> 55:05.750
- Clean hit. You're out.
- In the deer gut.

55:06.050 --> 55:08.850
- Average Joe's looking tough.
- Yes.

55:14.050 --> 55:16.550
There's a souvenir for a lucky fan.

55:18.950 --> 55:23.550
Timber. Peter La Fleur nails him.
That's all she wrote, folks.

55:23.850 --> 55:27.950
Average Joe's does some clear-cutting of
their own and moves onto the quarterfinal.

55:30.150 --> 55:32.850
Globo Gym hoping to drop an A-bomb
on the Kamikazes.

55:33.150 --> 55:36.650
I don't know how they can play
in diapers, Cotton. I never could.

55:36.850 --> 55:38.150
Peekaboo.

55:38.450 --> 55:41.350
White Goodman, employing
his patented peekaboo-style attack,

55:41.550 --> 55:44.850
tells Suzuki Toyota Oshinawa
this is my dojo.

55:46.650 --> 55:49.750
Is he gonna feel it tomorrow?
Right in his beak.

55:49.950 --> 55:54.650
A relentless Globo Gym attack led by
their Lilliputian leader, White Goodman.

55:55.050 --> 55:57.950
It's gotta be the hair. It's beautiful.

55:58.150 --> 56:02.450
Feathered and lethal.
You just don't see it nowadays.

56:03.850 --> 56:09.550
<i>Globo Gym says, "Domo arigato, Mr Roboto",
and breezes into the semifinals.</i>

56:12.150 --> 56:15.650
Skillz That Killz, ready?
Average Joe's, ready? Dodgeball.

56:15.850 --> 56:19.150
Average Joe's planning
to playa hate Skillz That Killz,

56:19.350 --> 56:21.650
the inner-city champs
for five years straight.

56:21.950 --> 56:26.450
Skillz might be looking past Average Joe's,
doing more dancing than dodgeballing.

56:26.650 --> 56:30.050
They better check themselves
before they wreck themselves.

56:30.350 --> 56:35.350
Right you are, partner.
Great catch. La Fleur wheels and fires.

56:36.350 --> 56:38.950
Winner. Average Joe's.

56:39.250 --> 56:43.950
And Average Joe's, not blinded by the
bling-bling, advances to the semifinal.

56:46.650 --> 56:51.050
Globo Gym's making mincemeat
of the Las Vegas Police Department.

56:51.350 --> 56:53.050
That's gotta hurt.

56:55.150 --> 56:56.950
B- b-b-bull's-eye.

56:57.150 --> 56:59.450
Winner. Globo Gym.

56:59.650 --> 57:04.450
Sportsmanship be darned.
Globo Gym hands the Las Vegas Police a 187,

57:04.750 --> 57:07.250
and they're going to the finals.

57:09.850 --> 57:13.950
The Poughkeepsie State Flying Cougars
are all over Average Joe's today.

57:14.250 --> 57:19.350
Itjust doesn't look good for 'em. The winner
of this match faces Globo Gym in the finals.

57:19.650 --> 57:21.650
Right in the testicles.

57:21.850 --> 57:24.250
Ouch-Town. Population: you, bro.

57:24.450 --> 57:27.550
Average Joe's down
to their final two players.

57:28.950 --> 57:31.150
La Fleur can't hold on.
He's gotta sit down.

57:31.350 --> 57:34.150
- Time out. Gordy.
- Time out. Time out.

57:34.850 --> 57:36.250
Time. Time is out.

57:36.450 --> 57:40.250
It looks like the clock is about to
strike midnight on this Cinderella story,

57:40.550 --> 57:43.150
turning Average Joe's
into the proverbial pumpkin.

57:43.350 --> 57:45.750
I sure do like pumpkins, Cotton.

57:47.150 --> 57:50.550
You won't hit 'em. They're too good,
and you suck somethin' awful.

57:50.850 --> 57:54.350
- Yes, sir. I do.
- Our only shot is for you to get angry.

57:54.550 --> 57:58.150
- Roger that. OK.
- All right. Hands in.

57:58.450 --> 58:00.750
- One, two, three.
- Joe's.

58:01.650 --> 58:04.550
You gotta get angry. Get angry now.

58:04.850 --> 58:09.450
Gordon Pibb, alone, facing five Cougars.
It's all over but the crying.

58:09.750 --> 58:13.050
<i>Sayonara, auf Wiedersehen and goodbye.</i>

58:26.450 --> 58:29.750
- Dodgeball.
- Let the dodgeball slaughter begin.

58:30.050 --> 58:31.850
Good deflection there.

58:32.050 --> 58:34.150
Hang on. And another one.

58:34.350 --> 58:36.850
Three balls at once. Who knew?

58:37.450 --> 58:39.850
Four on one.
Pibb won't go down without a fight.

58:40.050 --> 58:42.350
That's it.

58:42.550 --> 58:45.550
- You're kidding me.
- He's callin' 'em out.

58:46.550 --> 58:48.550
Now it's two on one. Who'd have thunk it?

58:48.650 --> 58:53.350
- Go, you crazy son of a bitch. Go.
- He's on the warpath.

58:55.750 --> 58:58.250
Incredible. It's one on one.

58:58.450 --> 59:02.050
- I can't believe it.
- It's just not believable, Cotton.

59:10.450 --> 59:11.450
Winner.

59:11.850 --> 59:14.950
Average Joe's wins.

59:15.150 --> 59:19.950
They are going to the finals
to play Globo Gym for $50,000.

59:20.250 --> 59:23.950
- That'll buy one heck of a pumpkin.
- Right you are, Pep.

59:24.250 --> 59:26.650
I never would have dreamed it possible.

59:26.850 --> 59:31.250
But with seven-time ADAA All-Star
Patches O'Houlihan at the helm,

59:31.550 --> 59:34.250
I guess it must be the luck of the Irish.

59:38.450 --> 59:42.350
Tomorrow we're gonna pecker-slap
those Globo Gym bastards.

59:42.550 --> 59:43.350
Yeah.

59:43.550 --> 59:47.850
- You really think we can beat Globo Gym?
- As long as we got Patches, we got a shot.

59:55.050 --> 59:56.250
My God.

59:57.150 --> 01:00:00.950
Well, it's probably the way
he would have wanted to go.

01:00:01.250 --> 01:00:04.550
- What?
- What are we gonna do without Patches?

01:00:04.850 --> 01:00:06.950
We're gonna get our taints handed to us.

01:00:07.050 --> 01:00:09.950
- What's a taint?
- I dunno. Sounds bad.

01:00:11.350 --> 01:00:14.450
Maybe you should
go say something to the guys.

01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:15.850
Yeah.

01:00:15.950 --> 01:00:22.350
They don't make a "sorry your coach just got
crushed by two tons of irony" Hallmark card.

01:00:24.150 --> 01:00:26.550
I'll be right back.

01:00:37.450 --> 01:00:38.850
What?

01:00:39.050 --> 01:00:44.050
We're opening a new Globo Gym in Mexico
City. I've been boning up on my Spanish.

01:00:46.450 --> 01:00:49.750
Me'Shell was having some digestive
problems. I hope you don't mind.

01:00:49.950 --> 01:00:52.150
Will you shut that?

01:00:52.350 --> 01:00:54.950
For all of us, baby.

01:00:57.650 --> 01:01:03.250
So that's the deal. I give you $100,000,
you sign over the deed to your gym.

01:01:03.650 --> 01:01:05.350
Period.

01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:07.450
End o'story.

01:01:07.650 --> 01:01:12.750
You really think you can come here and buy
me out, you're a lot dumber than I thought.

01:01:13.050 --> 01:01:18.450
Oh, I don't think I'm a lot dumber than you
thought I'd think that I thought I was once.

01:01:18.850 --> 01:01:21.950
Look, Peter, I know what it's like.

01:01:22.150 --> 01:01:26.550
Really. For all our blustery back-and-forth,
we're really pretty much the same guy.

01:01:26.850 --> 01:01:30.350
We're both leaders. And I like
what you've done with the gym over there.

01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:35.350
I love the whole "I'm not OK, you're not OK,
but that's OK" thing you got going.

01:01:35.650 --> 01:01:38.850
"You can be fat as long as
you're happy inside. " It works.

01:01:39.050 --> 01:01:42.350
And they love you. Whoo, do they love you.

01:01:42.550 --> 01:01:44.450
You're their Fonzie, Pete.

01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:46.850
"Hey. " Right?

01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:54.350
But do you really think it's fair for them
to put all that pressure on you? All the time?

01:01:55.650 --> 01:01:58.850
Looking to you to solve their every problem?

01:01:59.050 --> 01:02:00.550
I mean, come on.

01:02:00.750 --> 01:02:04.750
I know you. You know you.

01:02:05.050 --> 01:02:07.950
And I know you know that I know you.

01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:10.550
You're heading for a fall, Pete.

01:02:10.750 --> 01:02:14.050
Sooner or later,
Average Joe's is gonna close.

01:02:14.250 --> 01:02:18.250
And when it does, they're gonna blame you.

01:02:20.050 --> 01:02:23.850
I don't know if you've ever seen $100,000,
except maybe in the movies.

01:02:24.050 --> 01:02:27.850
But I assure you,
something gets lost in the translation.

01:02:31.050 --> 01:02:34.950
Money. $100,000. Dodgeball game.

01:02:37.050 --> 01:02:38.750
Take the money.

01:02:39.550 --> 01:02:44.250
Invest it in something.
Give it to charity, I don't care.

01:02:51.350 --> 01:02:53.350
Just sign the contract.

01:02:58.950 --> 01:03:01.750
Come on, guys. We got Peter.

01:03:01.950 --> 01:03:05.950
And they got guys named Laser and Blazer
and Taser, and all kinds of asers.

01:03:06.250 --> 01:03:09.650
Gar. Steve's gotta go drain the sea monster.

01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:12.950
Here. Justin, your virgin daiquiri.

01:03:13.050 --> 01:03:15.550
- Thanks, Ms Veatch.
- Nothing for me.

01:03:15.850 --> 01:03:19.950
- Dwight says we'll get killed out there, Peter.
- Let's not talk about tomorrow.

01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:23.450
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know. It's a little complicated.

01:03:23.750 --> 01:03:26.750
- But what do you think we should do?
- Yeah. Come on, tell us.

01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:28.150
What's the plan?

01:03:28.350 --> 01:03:31.450
What do you guys want from me?
I don't have a plan for you.

01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:35.650
We're gonna play Globo Gym tomorrow
and we're probably gonna lose.

01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:41.350
It's the truth. The sooner you guys get that
through your head, the easier this will all be.

01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:45.550
Jesus Christ.

01:03:46.050 --> 01:03:48.150
He didn't mean that.

01:03:48.350 --> 01:03:52.450
- Is he being serious?
- He's probably just stressed out.

01:03:52.750 --> 01:03:55.450
I've never seen him like that.

01:03:57.650 --> 01:04:01.350
Gar, matey, where are you headed? Peter...

01:04:01.550 --> 01:04:03.950
You are not a pirate.

01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:16.250
OK, guys. Let's get out of here
and get some rest for tomorrow, right?

01:04:24.050 --> 01:04:25.850
Dwight...

01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:30.850
I'm gonna catch up with you guys later.
I'm gonna have a bathroom... go to the drink...

01:04:31.150 --> 01:04:32.850
in the bathroom.

01:04:33.050 --> 01:04:35.550
Whatever you do, wash your hands.

01:04:46.050 --> 01:04:48.650
Excuse me, miss. I was wondering if...

01:04:48.850 --> 01:04:51.350
You are the one who stares at me.

01:04:51.550 --> 01:04:53.750
Why is this?

01:04:53.950 --> 01:04:58.350
Because I think you're
the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.

01:05:04.950 --> 01:05:07.250
Watch it, freak.

01:05:20.050 --> 01:05:22.350
Go back to Treasure Island.

01:05:22.550 --> 01:05:24.850
Fag.

01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:27.050
Screw you.

01:05:39.450 --> 01:05:43.150
Katie, bar the door.
It's time for the championship match

01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:45.750
here on ESPN8- the "Ocho".

01:05:45.950 --> 01:05:49.850
We've seen it all here, folks.
Grit, determination, incontinence.

01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:52.650
And it's all come down to this -
a Cinderella story.

01:05:52.850 --> 01:05:57.350
Average Joe's Gymnasium hopes to
drive their vorpal blade snicker-snack

01:05:57.650 --> 01:06:01.550
into the heart of the dodgeball Jabberwocky
that is the Globo Gym Purple Cobras,

01:06:01.750 --> 01:06:05.450
and walk away with $50,000
in stone-cold cash.

01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:09.650
Hello, everybody, and welcome
to what you've all been waiting for.

01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:13.650
A David-and-Goliath story
truer than the Bible itself.

01:06:13.850 --> 01:06:17.750
The championship dodgeball match
here on ESPN8- the "Ocho".

01:06:20.650 --> 01:06:22.250
Peter?

01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:26.250
Peter?

01:06:26.350 --> 01:06:28.850
Hello?

01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:30.450
Peter?

01:06:30.550 --> 01:06:33.250
Come on, everybody headed down...

01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:44.650
So what happens on a double fault?

01:06:44.850 --> 01:06:50.050
On a double fault you go to sudden-death
elimination. It's Continuation Rule 113-D.

01:06:50.350 --> 01:06:52.950
- Whatever.
- Hey, guys, wait up.

01:06:57.050 --> 01:06:58.450
Justin.

01:06:58.650 --> 01:07:02.650
- I've been looking for you everywhere.
- Really? I mean, why? What's up?

01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:06.750
Derek fell off the roller coaster
and broke every bone in his body.

01:07:07.050 --> 01:07:08.450
My God, that's awful.

01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:12.050
We were the centre Kewpie. With no
centre Kewpie we can't do our routine.

01:07:12.250 --> 01:07:15.150
- No. I'm sorry.
- You gotta do it.

01:07:15.350 --> 01:07:16.950
What?

01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:19.150
No, no, no, no, no. I can't.

01:07:19.350 --> 01:07:23.050
Please. You are the only one in Las Vegas
who knows our routine.

01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:28.650
- The dodgeball championship's at noon.
- You'll be back in time. I promise.

01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:33.550
- All right, I'll do it.
- Yes.

01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:35.750
- I gotta tell the guys.
- No. No time.

01:07:35.950 --> 01:07:37.550
- I gotta tell the guys.
- No time.

01:07:39.450 --> 01:07:44.250
Average Joe's are a 50-1 underdog here today.
No one is giving them much of a chance.

01:07:44.550 --> 01:07:46.250
What do you think, Pep?

01:07:46.450 --> 01:07:48.550
I spoke to White Goodman before the match

01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:53.650
and he told me that his team
really wants to win this one.

01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:57.150
Right. And the stage is set for
Darwin's cruellest play to unfold.

01:07:57.450 --> 01:08:01.050
So don't go anywhere, folks.
The Schadenfreude is about to begin.

01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:05.450
- I don't understand. Why would Peter leave?
- He knows we're gonna get killed.

01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:10.750
Hey. That's not true. I don't know why Peter
left, but we can do this without him.

01:08:11.050 --> 01:08:14.150
We just have to figure it out.
Owen, you'll have to play.

01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:17.750
- OK, yeah.
- Great. But we'll still be two players short.

01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:21.850
We're still missing the teenage love-puppy
and Steve the Pirate.

01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:24.450
Who's Steve the Pirate?

01:08:24.649 --> 01:08:28.350
The only guy on our team
who dresses like a pirate.

01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:32.550
Wait. There's a guy on our team
dressed like a pirate?

01:08:34.450 --> 01:08:41.850
And now, let's hear it for the West Davenport
High School Charging Donkeys.

01:08:42.250 --> 01:08:44.250
Donkeys.

01:09:08.950 --> 01:09:10.450
Go, Donkeys.

01:09:13.450 --> 01:09:16.350
- We did it.
- Holy cow. My God.

01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:19.750
- It was perfect. You were perfect.
- God, I gotta go.

01:09:19.950 --> 01:09:22.149
Wait. Aren't you gonna stay for the trophy?

01:09:22.350 --> 01:09:24.950
I'm sorry, Amber.
I got my own trophy to win.

01:09:41.850 --> 01:09:44.250
Now I'm going.

01:09:49.350 --> 01:09:53.850
Here come the Purple Cobras,
led by White Goodman. All business.

01:09:54.149 --> 01:09:57.550
We haven't seen Average Joe's yet.
They haven't made it to the court.

01:09:57.850 --> 01:10:01.250
It could be a psychological ploy,
or something worse.

01:10:01.450 --> 01:10:05.650
They're definitely not on the court, Cotton.
Their absence is noticeable.

01:10:05.950 --> 01:10:10.550
We'll be right back
after these words from our sponsors...

01:10:12.450 --> 01:10:14.750
Can I get a bottle of water?

01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:19.550
Aren't you Peter La Fleur?

01:10:20.650 --> 01:10:24.250
- Lance Armstrong?
- Yeah, that's me. But I'm a big fan of yours.

01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:28.250
- Really?
- Yeah, I've been watching the dodgeball.

01:10:28.450 --> 01:10:33.250
I just can't get enough of it. I'm really pullin'
for you against those jerks from Globo Gym.

01:10:34.150 --> 01:10:37.450
I think you better hurry up
or you're gonna be late.

01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:41.950
- Actually, I decided to quit, Lance.
- Quit?

01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:48.750
Once I thought of quittin', when I had brain,
lung and testicular cancer at the same time.

01:10:49.750 --> 01:10:52.450
But with the support of my friends
I got back on the bike

01:10:52.650 --> 01:10:55.250
and I won the Tour de France
five times in a row.

01:10:55.450 --> 01:10:59.250
But I'm sure you have a good reason to quit.

01:10:59.550 --> 01:11:02.950
What are you dying from
that's keepin' you from the finals?

01:11:03.150 --> 01:11:07.150
Right now, it feels a little bit like shame.

01:11:07.450 --> 01:11:13.050
If people never quit when the going got tough
they'd have nothing to regret all their lives.

01:11:13.450 --> 01:11:18.250
Good luck to you, Peter. I'm sure
this decision won't haunt you forever.

01:11:24.850 --> 01:11:28.750
Steve? Steve the Pirate? "Scurvy. "

01:11:29.050 --> 01:11:33.050
- No. Not ringing any bells.
- Forget it, man.

01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:37.450
We'll play with four people. It's not
an advantage. Can't you bend the rules?

01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:41.950
There's nothing I can do. Rules are rules.
You don't have enough players.

01:11:42.150 --> 01:11:46.050
Inform the committee and Mr Goodman
about Average Joe's forfeit.

01:11:46.350 --> 01:11:49.450
- Yes, sir.
- Better luck next year.

01:11:51.250 --> 01:11:52.750
Excuse me.

01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:56.250
Sorry I'm late. You won't believe
whatjust happened. Hey, guys.

01:11:56.450 --> 01:11:59.150
You're just in time to help us forfeit.

01:11:59.350 --> 01:12:01.350
Forfeit? Why?

01:12:03.350 --> 01:12:06.450
Well, I don't know what to tell you, but...

01:12:06.650 --> 01:12:10.450
Yes, I'm being told that Average Joe's
does not have enough players

01:12:10.750 --> 01:12:13.550
and will be forfeiting
the championship match.

01:12:13.750 --> 01:12:16.750
It's a bold strategy, Cotton.
Let's see if it pays off for 'em.

01:12:17.050 --> 01:12:22.450
To the tournament floor we go, for the sceptre
presentation from the Dodgeball Chancellor.

01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:26.450
Ladies and gentlemen,
by the power vested in me

01:12:26.750 --> 01:12:31.750
by our governing body, the American
Dodgeball Association of America,

01:12:32.050 --> 01:12:36.550
and in concurrence with our sponsors,
Lumber Liquidators and Omaha Steaks,

01:12:36.850 --> 01:12:38.850
it gives me great pleasure

01:12:39.050 --> 01:12:43.750
to declare the winner of this year's
Las Vegas International Tournament to be...

01:12:44.050 --> 01:12:46.250
Wait. He's here.

01:12:50.750 --> 01:12:53.350
Hey, guys. Sorry I'm late.

01:12:53.650 --> 01:12:55.750
We're ready to play, Your Honour.

01:12:55.850 --> 01:13:00.550
Too late. Your lovable band of losers already
forfeited. The trophy and money are mine.

01:13:00.950 --> 01:13:04.250
He's right. The team already forfeited.
There's nothing you can do.

01:13:04.450 --> 01:13:07.050
Facial, La Fleur. Total facial.

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:10.150
Actually, that's not true.

01:13:10.250 --> 01:13:14.350
The committee can overrule the chancellor -
that's you, sir - by a two-thirds vote.

01:13:14.650 --> 01:13:16.850
He's right. He's right. It's a bylaw.

01:13:19.150 --> 01:13:21.650
- It's a bylaw.
- What's a bylaw?

01:13:22.750 --> 01:13:26.150
- Hang on a second here, folks.
- Let them play.

01:13:26.450 --> 01:13:30.250
We mightjust have a championship game yet.

01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:33.450
Listen to this crowd.

01:13:33.650 --> 01:13:35.750
Unbelievable.

01:13:35.950 --> 01:13:41.050
Pepper, it's clear what the crowd wants, but
the committee members have the final say.

01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:44.450
And it looks like they've
come to a decision.

01:13:44.650 --> 01:13:47.350
Joe's needs two "yes" votes to play.

01:13:47.650 --> 01:13:50.850
- There's a thumbs-up. Good news for Joe's.
- Please.

01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:54.150
- Let's see how our second judge votes.
- Thank you.

01:13:54.350 --> 01:14:01.150
Oh, tough sledding there. It's all even. Their
fate hangs on the thumb of our final judge.

01:14:01.550 --> 01:14:04.950
Thumbs up. Average Joe's can play.

01:14:05.250 --> 01:14:08.350
That is pure poppycock.
You're gonna let them do that?

01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:11.950
- Thank you, Chuck Norris.
- Thank you, Peter.

01:14:13.850 --> 01:14:17.350
All right, captains. Shake hands,
and let's have a clean match.

01:14:17.650 --> 01:14:19.650
Good luck, White.

01:14:21.150 --> 01:14:24.250
Cram it up your cramhole, La Fleur.

01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:27.850
Prepare to be humiliated
on cable television.

01:14:28.050 --> 01:14:30.050
Whatever.

01:14:32.150 --> 01:14:35.150
- Nice of you to show up.
- Yeah, I thought so too.

01:14:35.350 --> 01:14:38.150
What? I got a plan.

01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:46.050
Let's play smart. Wait for two-on-ones. Cover
closely for your pick-ups. What's our motto?

01:14:46.450 --> 01:14:48.550
- "Aim low".
- That's right.

01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:51.550
All I'm asking is that
you give it your best for Patches.

01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:55.850
I say we go out there, let it all hang loose,
try to have some fun.

01:14:56.150 --> 01:14:58.750
I mean, it's only dodgeball, right?

01:14:58.950 --> 01:15:02.750
- Put 'em in. One, two, three.
- Joe's.

01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:28.750
Globo Gym, ready?

01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:31.750
Average Joe's, ready?

01:15:34.150 --> 01:15:35.050
Dodgeball.

01:15:35.250 --> 01:15:40.550
Championship match is under way.
Average Joe's versus the Globo Gym Goliath.

01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:44.550
Quick elimination there for Kate Veatch.

01:15:46.050 --> 01:15:49.150
White Goodman's hit,
but that ball's up for grabs. And...

01:15:49.350 --> 01:15:51.250
- It's caught.
- That's a catch.

01:15:51.450 --> 01:15:54.850
- You're out, La Fleur.
- Peter La Fleur has gotta sit down.

01:15:55.150 --> 01:15:58.250
And Joe's has lost
their two best players early.

01:15:58.750 --> 01:16:00.850
Dwight Baumgarten still playing hard.

01:16:01.050 --> 01:16:03.550
Hits Me'Shell Jones right on the dome.

01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:05.650
You're mine next time.

01:16:09.050 --> 01:16:13.850
<i>Right in the tokus.
2-1, ese, and Globo Gym is dominating.</i>

01:16:18.150 --> 01:16:20.450
- Hi.
- Hey.

01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:25.150
- You're out.
- I don't know what that was,

01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:29.950
but it leaves Joe's on the wrong side
of a 4-2 advantage.

01:16:30.250 --> 01:16:33.150
Joe's gets an elimination.
It's two on three.

01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:34.850
Get out.

01:16:35.050 --> 01:16:37.350
Gordo. Lose your temper. Get mad.

01:16:39.450 --> 01:16:43.450
White Goodman with a catch. Gordon Pibb
goes out, Me'Shell Jones comes back in.

01:16:43.750 --> 01:16:45.450
You're out, four-eyes.

01:16:45.550 --> 01:16:49.750
Well, it's all up to Average Joe's youngest
member. He's gotta make a play here, Pepper.

01:16:50.050 --> 01:16:51.750
Word, Cotton.

01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:57.050
Four Cobras and one Joe. Even a rabid
mongoose wouldn't have a chance now.

01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:59.950
- Nice dodge.
- Stay alive. Stay alive.

01:17:02.150 --> 01:17:04.450
They're just toying with the young man now.

01:17:04.650 --> 01:17:07.550
He's gotta avoid getting hit.
That's the key.

01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:09.450
Justin, let's go.

01:17:10.850 --> 01:17:12.250
What a great catch.

01:17:12.350 --> 01:17:15.650
And another.
Peter La Fleur comes back into the game.

01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:19.750
Just like that, a three-player swing.
Joe's isn't done yet.

01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:21.550
Justin.

01:17:21.750 --> 01:17:24.150
I love you.

01:17:24.350 --> 01:17:26.150
I love you t...

01:17:26.950 --> 01:17:28.950
Joanie loves Chachi.

01:17:29.150 --> 01:17:32.750
Two players left on each side.
What a match. What a sport.

01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:38.950
Throw out the rule book, folks,
it's down and dirty now. Street dodgeball.

01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:44.650
Look out. La Fleur goes down -
he's a sitting duck.

01:17:49.950 --> 01:17:55.850
How about that, folks? Kate Veatch takes the
bullet for Peter La Fleur. Now that's sacrifice.

01:17:56.150 --> 01:18:00.850
As touching a moment as we've seen
on the dodgeball court all tournament.

01:18:01.850 --> 01:18:04.350
A blatant cheap shot from White Goodman.

01:18:04.650 --> 01:18:09.150
- That's court misconduct. That's a warning.
- Come on. Gimme a break.

01:18:10.450 --> 01:18:11.950
- You OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:18:12.150 --> 01:18:14.550
- Jesus. Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:17.750
- It was an accident. I thought she was in play.
- Not a chance.

01:18:17.950 --> 01:18:20.850
We're sweating like greased monkeys.
I can't hold on to a ball.

01:18:21.050 --> 01:18:24.150
Sorry, miss, but you're out.
You gotta get off the court.

01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:26.150
Watch him, man.

01:18:26.250 --> 01:18:28.450
- Hey, Peter.
- Yeah?

01:18:28.650 --> 01:18:30.350
Kick his ass.

01:18:31.050 --> 01:18:34.050
- Here's the restart.
- Players, to your positions.

01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:38.650
<i>Looks like it's gonna be a two-on-one,
a ménage à trois of pain.</i>

01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:42.550
Usually you pay double
for that kind of action, Cotton.

01:18:44.650 --> 01:18:48.250
You're playing ready dodgeball.
Balls are at your feet.

01:18:48.450 --> 01:18:50.650
Ready? Dodgeball.

01:18:50.850 --> 01:18:55.750
It's a cat-and-mouse game, folks.
Peter La Fleur has gotta wait for his shot.

01:18:59.450 --> 01:19:01.850
He gets the elimination.

01:19:03.150 --> 01:19:08.650
My. Globo Gym wins.
A Cinderella story cast asunder.

01:19:09.050 --> 01:19:13.050
Average Joe's has come all this way
for nothing. Absolutely nothing.

01:19:13.350 --> 01:19:15.950
They're not gonna get anything, Cotton.

01:19:17.150 --> 01:19:21.150
No elimination. Double fault.
You stepped over the line on the throw.

01:19:21.450 --> 01:19:25.250
What? You gotta be out of your mind.
That is the worst call I've ever seen.

01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:29.750
I'm out here busting my butt and you come in
with a bush-league call like that? Bullcrap.

01:19:29.950 --> 01:19:34.750
ADAA Continuation Rule 113-D, sir.
Sudden death.

01:19:35.150 --> 01:19:36.550
All right. Bring it.

01:19:36.650 --> 01:19:39.950
I don't believe it, folks. Sudden death.

01:19:40.250 --> 01:19:41.950
Well, let me tell you,

01:19:42.050 --> 01:19:47.550
a double-fault final-play elimination hasn't
occurred since the Helsinki episode of 1919,

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:50.650
and I think we all remember
how that turned out.

01:19:50.850 --> 01:19:57.150
Ladies and gentlemen, it's the greatest
happening in sport. Sudden-death dodgeball.

01:19:57.550 --> 01:19:59.850
Pepper needs new shorts.

01:20:02.050 --> 01:20:05.150
White, Peter, this is sudden death.

01:20:05.650 --> 01:20:11.050
Only striking an opposing player eliminates
them. Catching the ball does nothing.

01:20:11.350 --> 01:20:15.150
Both feet must remain
in the triangle at all times.

01:20:15.450 --> 01:20:19.950
You may throw any time after my call.
Understood?

01:20:21.050 --> 01:20:24.750
OK. Let's have a clean match.
Good luck, gentlemen.

01:20:25.450 --> 01:20:28.150
This is it, La Loser.

01:20:29.850 --> 01:20:33.350
You ready for the hurricane?

01:20:34.650 --> 01:20:38.150
Just don't go cryin' to mama when
I spank you in front of all these people.

01:20:39.550 --> 01:20:44.350
You don't go crying to your daddy
after I wipe it up with your face.

01:20:46.250 --> 01:20:49.050
- White?
- Yeah?

01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:53.650
- You look awful fat in those pants.
- Players, to your positions.

01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:57.550
This is about gamesmanship.
Throw early and you're defenceless.

01:20:57.750 --> 01:21:03.550
Throw late and you're eliminated.
Dilemma, thy name is dodgeball.

01:21:03.950 --> 01:21:06.950
This sport doesn't build character,
it reveals it.

01:21:07.150 --> 01:21:10.050
Effin' A, Cotton. Effin' A.

01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:14.050
Come on, talk to me.

01:21:15.750 --> 01:21:17.950
Listen up, crotch stain.

01:21:18.150 --> 01:21:22.350
Remember your training
and trust your instincts.

01:21:22.550 --> 01:21:25.150
You can do it. I believe in you.

01:21:28.250 --> 01:21:29.950
Bye-bye.

01:21:30.050 --> 01:21:31.050
Right.

01:21:31.250 --> 01:21:34.050
Players, turn and step in.

01:21:49.950 --> 01:21:52.450
What the hell's he doing?

01:21:52.650 --> 01:21:55.150
I don't know.

01:21:57.450 --> 01:21:58.550
Get a load of this guy.

01:21:58.650 --> 01:22:02.350
In 23 years of broadcasting
I thought I'd seen it all, folks.

01:22:02.650 --> 01:22:06.350
But it looks like Peter La Fleur
has actually blindfolded himself.

01:22:06.550 --> 01:22:09.250
He will not be able
to see very well, Cotton.

01:22:18.850 --> 01:22:21.350
Ready?

01:22:26.250 --> 01:22:28.650
Dodgeball.

01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:36.950
Goodbye, Peter.

01:22:37.150 --> 01:22:39.850
I always knew you were weak.

01:22:43.450 --> 01:22:46.150
Air Goodman, comin' at ya.

01:22:54.150 --> 01:22:57.150
Down goes Goodman.
Down goes Goodman.

01:22:57.350 --> 01:23:00.550
Winner. Average Joe's.

01:23:04.150 --> 01:23:07.650
Do you believe in unlikelihoods?

01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:10.950
Average Joe's shocking the dodgeball world

01:23:11.250 --> 01:23:15.350
and upsetting Globo Gym
in the championship match.

01:23:15.650 --> 01:23:16.950
Unbelievable.

01:23:17.050 --> 01:23:21.250
I have been to the Great Wall of China.
I have seen the Pyramids of Egypt.

01:23:21.550 --> 01:23:24.050
I've even witnessed a grown man
satisfy a camel.

01:23:24.250 --> 01:23:26.450
But never in all my years as a sportscaster

01:23:26.650 --> 01:23:31.650
have I witnessed something as improbable,
as impossible, as what we've witnessed here.

01:23:31.950 --> 01:23:36.550
The little team that could, Average Joe's
Gymnasium, underdogs throughout,

01:23:36.850 --> 01:23:41.450
stand before us, aglow,
as true dodgeball champions.

01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:46.250
On behalf of the American Dodgeball
Association of America,

01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:50.850
it is my honour to present to you
this cheque for $50,000.

01:23:57.350 --> 01:24:00.250
What are you so happy about, La Fleur?
None of this matters.

01:24:00.450 --> 01:24:04.750
You signed your gym over to me last night,
remember? You lost, I won.

01:24:05.050 --> 01:24:07.150
Suck failure, freaks.

01:24:07.350 --> 01:24:10.450
Peter, is that true?

01:24:10.650 --> 01:24:12.550
Yeah, it's true.

01:24:12.750 --> 01:24:15.950
It's true I sold Average Joe's to White.

01:24:16.150 --> 01:24:18.450
It's true that every man has his price.

01:24:18.650 --> 01:24:23.450
And it's also true that money won
is a lot sweeter than money earned.

01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:27.950
- Now he's a philosophiser.
- Excuse us. Step aside, please.

01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:31.650
Your winnings, Mr La Fleur.
Congratulations.

01:24:31.850 --> 01:24:35.650
- Right on time. I appreciate it. Thank you.
- What is that? What winnings?

01:24:35.850 --> 01:24:40.350
Gosh, I totally forgot to tell you. I took the
$100,000 bribe that you gave me last night,

01:24:40.650 --> 01:24:43.550
and I put it on us to win.
We were going off at 50-1.

01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:47.150
Anyone? Top of your head?
What's 50 times $100,000?

01:24:47.350 --> 01:24:48.650
$50,000?

01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:52.750
$5 million. Peter, are you kidding me?

01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:55.050
Surprise.

01:24:58.550 --> 01:25:03.450
Stick it in your ear, La Fleur. I wouldn't sell
you your gym back for all King Midas's silver.

01:25:03.750 --> 01:25:08.350
The gym is mine. So you can take your band
of yellow-bellied losers and crawl out of here.

01:25:08.650 --> 01:25:11.550
You're right. I can't make you
sell Average Joe's to me.

01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:15.350
So I guess I'll just take your advice
and invest in something.

01:25:15.650 --> 01:25:19.750
- Say the controlling stake of Globo Gym.
- That's preposterous. I'd never allow it.

01:25:19.950 --> 01:25:23.550
Globo Gym is a publicly traded company.
There's nothing you can do about it.

01:25:23.850 --> 01:25:29.050
So I would control Globo Gym
and everything that Globo Gym owns,

01:25:29.350 --> 01:25:33.350
which, as of last night,
is Average Joe's Gym.

01:25:34.850 --> 01:25:36.250
I'm your new boss, White.

01:25:36.450 --> 01:25:39.750
You can't be my boss. Nobody can.
I'm my own boss. I created myself.

01:25:40.050 --> 01:25:43.050
- You're fired, pal.
- You can't do anything to me.

01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:46.650
You're going down, La Fleur,
like a sweet muffin.

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:50.350
- Another time, another time.
- You suck, La Fleur.

01:25:52.450 --> 01:25:54.450
Give me that.

01:25:57.450 --> 01:25:59.850
Man, the blindfold was crazy.

01:26:01.450 --> 01:26:03.950
Peter.

01:26:04.150 --> 01:26:06.550
Look. It's Steve the Pirate.

01:26:10.350 --> 01:26:15.350
I just wanted to tell you
that I thought about what you said, and

01:26:16.650 --> 01:26:18.950
I guess you're right.

01:26:19.150 --> 01:26:21.350
I'm not really a pirate.

01:26:22.750 --> 01:26:25.250
I don't know, Steve.

01:26:25.450 --> 01:26:27.550
If you're not a pirate,

01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:31.450
who the hell am I gonna split
all that buried treasure with?

01:26:36.750 --> 01:26:38.550
Peter...

01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:40.550
Gar, Steve.

01:26:46.150 --> 01:26:47.750
We missed you.

01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:52.350
Hey, you.

01:26:52.550 --> 01:26:54.550
Hey, you.

01:26:56.350 --> 01:26:58.350
- Joyce?
- Kate.

01:26:58.850 --> 01:27:03.150
- I thought you were in Guam.
- I caught an early flight. I wouldn't miss this.

01:27:03.450 --> 01:27:05.650
You are amazing.

01:27:09.350 --> 01:27:13.750
- I told you she was a lesbian.
- Wow. Good call.

01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:17.450
Hey. I'm not a lesbian.

01:27:17.650 --> 01:27:19.150
You're not?

01:27:19.350 --> 01:27:20.850
No.

01:27:21.050 --> 01:27:23.350
I'm bisexual.

01:27:25.050 --> 01:27:26.850
Snap.

01:27:27.650 --> 01:27:31.050
All right, everybody. Smile big.

01:27:36.050 --> 01:27:39.750
Hi. I'm Peter La Fleur,
owner and operator of Average Joe's Gym.

01:27:40.050 --> 01:27:43.550
I'm here to tell you
you're perfectjust the way you are.

01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:49.250
But if you feel like losin' a few pounds, gettin'
healthier, and makin' friends in the process,

01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:51.250
Joe's is the place for you.

01:27:51.450 --> 01:27:54.750
Don't forget that youth dodgeball classes
are forming right now.

01:27:55.050 --> 01:27:59.750
So come on down and learn a great game the
way it's supposed to be played. Right, kids?

01:28:00.050 --> 01:28:01.950
Right.

01:28:11.550 --> 01:28:13.550
Spare me.

01:28:13.750 --> 01:28:16.150
I won that tournament.

01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:21.650
Fucking Chuck Norris.

01:31:27.250 --> 01:31:30.350
Yeah. I hope you're all happy now.

01:31:30.650 --> 01:31:33.050
Good guy wins, bad guy loses.

01:31:33.250 --> 01:31:35.650
Big friggin' surprise.

01:31:36.850 --> 01:31:38.750
I love happy endings.

01:31:41.850 --> 01:31:46.050
You know, that's the problem
with the American cinema.

01:31:46.350 --> 01:31:48.750
Can't handle any complexity in it, you know?

01:31:48.950 --> 01:31:52.950
"Don't make me think,
I just wanna be entertained. "

01:31:53.250 --> 01:31:55.050
All right, fine.

01:31:55.250 --> 01:31:58.750
You want a little somethin'- somethin'
for the ride home?

01:31:58.950 --> 01:32:01.350
Check these boots out for size.

01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:05.450
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard

01:32:05.650 --> 01:32:07.650
And they're like, "It's better than yours"

01:32:07.850 --> 01:32:09.750
Damn right, it's better than yours

01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:12.450
I could teach you, but I'd have to charge

01:32:13.550 --> 01:32:17.550
What the boys go crazy for

01:32:19.150 --> 01:32:20.250
They lose their minds

01:32:20.350 --> 01:32:22.650
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard

01:32:22.850 --> 01:32:24.550
Damn right, it's better than yours

01:32:24.750 --> 01:32:28.150
I could teach you, but I'd have to charge

01:32:30.050 --> 01:32:32.950
You happy? Fatty make a funny?
