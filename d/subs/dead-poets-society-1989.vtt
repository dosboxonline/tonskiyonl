00:41.140 --> 00:44.230
Now remember,
keep your shoulders back.

00:53.240 --> 00:55.870
Okay, put your arm
around your brother. That's it.

00:55.950 --> 00:57.910
That's it.
Right, and breathe in.

00:59.700 --> 01:01.620
Okay, one more.

01:06.090 --> 01:08.170
Now, just to review,

01:08.250 --> 01:10.720
you're going to follow along
the procession...

01:10.760 --> 01:13.720
until you get to the headmaster.

01:13.760 --> 01:16.350
At that point,
he will indicate to you...

01:16.430 --> 01:18.510
to light the candles
of the boys.

01:18.600 --> 01:21.180
All right, boys,
let's settle down.

01:27.770 --> 01:30.570
Banners up!

02:21.290 --> 02:25.370
Ladies and gentlemen, boys...

02:25.460 --> 02:27.380
the Light of Knowledge.

02:41.970 --> 02:47.350
One hundred years ago,
in 1859,

02:47.440 --> 02:51.230
41 boys sat in this room...

02:51.320 --> 02:53.780
and were asked the same question...

02:53.860 --> 02:57.070
that now greets you
at the start of each semester.

02:57.160 --> 03:00.990
Gentlemen,
what are the Four Pillars?

03:03.410 --> 03:08.210
Tradition. Honor.
Discipline. Excellence.

03:09.580 --> 03:11.540
In her first year,

03:11.630 --> 03:15.720
Welton Academy graduated five students.

03:15.800 --> 03:18.720
Last year we graduated 51.

03:18.800 --> 03:21.850
And more than 75 percent of those...

03:21.930 --> 03:24.680
went on to the Ivy League.

03:24.770 --> 03:29.520
This-This kind of accomplishment...

03:29.600 --> 03:31.560
is the result...

03:31.650 --> 03:36.440
of fervent dedication
to the principles taught here.

03:36.860 --> 03:40.240
This is why you parents
have been sending us your sons.

03:40.280 --> 03:43.330
This is why
we are the best...

03:43.370 --> 03:46.410
preparatory school
in the United States.

03:54.590 --> 03:57.050
As you know,

03:57.090 --> 04:02.180
our beloved Mr. Portius of the
English Department retired last term.

04:02.220 --> 04:06.140
You will have the opportunity later to
meet his replacement, Mr. John Keating,

04:07.560 --> 04:11.100
himself an honors graduate
of this school.

04:11.190 --> 04:13.770
And who, for the past several years,
has been teaching...

04:13.860 --> 04:16.149
at the highly regarded
Chester School in London.

04:21.990 --> 04:23.910
Richard, you forgot your bag!

04:23.990 --> 04:26.200
Hi, Johnny!
Hey, how you doin'?

04:26.240 --> 04:29.040
Don't worry.
I got your room assignment.

04:40.430 --> 04:43.390
They haven't moved
the dining area.

04:43.430 --> 04:45.390
Glad you could come by.

04:45.430 --> 04:48.520
- Thrilling ceremony,
as usual, Dr. Nolan.
- You've been away too long.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.520
- Hello, Dr. Nolan.
- Good to have you back.

04:50.600 --> 04:52.770
- This is our youngest, Todd.
- Mr. Anderson.

04:52.810 --> 04:56.440
You have some big shoes to fill.
Your brother was one of our finest.

04:56.520 --> 04:59.570
Thank you.

04:59.650 --> 05:02.610
- Lovely ceremony.
- Thank you. Glad you liked it.

05:02.700 --> 05:04.620
- Gale.
- Tom.

05:04.700 --> 05:06.620
- Good to see you again.
- Hello, Mr. Nolan.

05:06.700 --> 05:09.910
- We expect great things
from you this year.
- Thank you, sir.

05:09.950 --> 05:11.910
Well, he won't disappoint us.
Right, Neil?

05:11.960 --> 05:14.290
I'll do my best, sir.

05:14.330 --> 05:16.290
Hey, come on, son.

05:16.380 --> 05:17.630
- Chin up.
- Okay.

05:17.710 --> 05:19.130
- No tears now.
- Chin up.

05:19.170 --> 05:21.130
- I don't want to go here.
- Honey, I love you.

05:21.220 --> 05:25.180
- I'll walk you over.
- You be a good boy. Do your lessons.

05:29.970 --> 05:32.480
Hey! I hear
we're gonna be roommates.

05:32.560 --> 05:35.150
- I'm Neil Perry.
- I'm Todd Anderson.

05:35.230 --> 05:37.320
Why'd you leave Balincrest?

05:37.400 --> 05:39.320
My brother went here.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.360
Oh, so you're
that Anderson.

05:41.490 --> 05:43.650
- This is for his sinuses.
- Yes. I see.

05:43.740 --> 05:46.990
Oh, and if he can't swallow,
you give him one of these.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.990
And if he has trouble breathing,
you can give him some of those.

05:50.080 --> 05:53.500
- Did you remember your vaporizer?
- Yes, I put it in my room.

05:59.090 --> 06:01.130
- Hey, how's it going, Neil?
- Hey, Knox.

06:01.170 --> 06:03.970
Neil, study group tonight?

06:04.010 --> 06:06.640
- Yeah, sure.
- Business as usual, huh?

06:06.680 --> 06:09.470
Hey, I heard you got the new kid.
Looks like a stiff!

06:09.510 --> 06:12.350
Oops.

06:15.020 --> 06:17.150
Listen, don't mind Cameron.

06:17.190 --> 06:21.820
He was born with his foot in his mouth.
You know what I mean?

06:24.200 --> 06:27.570
Rumor has it...
you did summer school.

06:27.660 --> 06:30.830
Yep. Chemistry. My father
thought I should get ahead.

06:30.870 --> 06:32.830
How was your summer, slick?

06:32.870 --> 06:34.710
Keen.

06:36.370 --> 06:38.420
Meeks. Door. Closed.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.710
Yes, sir.

06:40.750 --> 06:43.010
Gentlemen, what are
the Four Pillars?

06:43.050 --> 06:47.840
Travesty. Horror.
Decadence. Excrement.

06:47.890 --> 06:50.680
Okay. Study group.

06:50.720 --> 06:53.680
Meeks aced Latin.
I didn't quite flunk English.

06:53.720 --> 06:56.190
- If you want, we got our study group.
- Sure.

06:56.230 --> 06:58.520
Cameron asked me too.
Anyone mind including him?

06:58.560 --> 07:01.110
Hmm, what's his specialty?
Bootlicking?

07:01.190 --> 07:03.400
- Come on, he's your roommate.
- That's not my fault.

07:03.440 --> 07:07.950
I'm sorry. My name is Stephen Meeks.

07:08.030 --> 07:10.120
Oh!
This is Todd Anderson.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.120
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

07:12.200 --> 07:14.620
Charlie Dalton.

07:14.700 --> 07:17.210
Knox Overstreet.

07:17.250 --> 07:19.210
Todd's brother was
Jeffrey Anderson.

07:19.250 --> 07:21.460
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- What do you know?

07:21.540 --> 07:25.420
- Valedictorian. National Merit Scholar.
- Oh, well...

07:25.510 --> 07:27.630
welcome to Hell-ton.

07:27.720 --> 07:31.760
It's every bit as tough as they say
unless you're a genius like Meeks.

07:31.850 --> 07:34.310
He flatters me.
That's why I help him with Latin.

07:34.390 --> 07:37.310
And English. And Trig.

07:37.390 --> 07:40.440
It's open.

07:43.730 --> 07:45.820
Father, I thought you'd gone.

07:45.900 --> 07:48.610
- Mr. Perry.
- Keep your seats, fellows.

07:48.700 --> 07:52.490
Neil, I've just spoken
to Mr. Nolan.

07:52.580 --> 07:55.830
You're taking too many extracurricular
activities this semester,

07:55.910 --> 07:58.790
and I've decided that
you should drop the school annual.

07:58.870 --> 08:00.750
But I'm the assistant editor
this year.

08:00.790 --> 08:04.460
- Well, I'm sorry, Neil.
- But, Father, I can't.

08:04.550 --> 08:08.470
- It wouldn't be fair.
- Would you excuse us for a moment?

08:19.560 --> 08:22.610
Don't you ever dispute me in public.
Do you understand?

08:22.690 --> 08:25.150
- Father, I wasn't disputing...
- After you've finished medical school...

08:25.190 --> 08:27.280
and you're on your own,
then you can do as you damn well please.

08:27.360 --> 08:30.660
But until then, you do as I tell you.
Is that clear?

08:30.700 --> 08:33.280
Yes, sir. I'm sorry.

08:35.539 --> 08:37.500
You know how much this means
to your mother, don't you?

08:37.580 --> 08:39.830
Yes, sir.

08:39.870 --> 08:43.960
You know me;
always taking on too much.

08:44.039 --> 08:46.630
Well, that's my boy.

08:46.710 --> 08:50.680
- You need anything, you let us know.
- Yes, sir.

08:58.890 --> 09:02.690
Why doesn't he
let you do what you want?

09:02.770 --> 09:06.070
Yeah, Neil. Tell him off.
Couldn't get any worse.

09:06.150 --> 09:08.070
Oh, that's rich.
Like you guys tell your parents off?

09:08.150 --> 09:10.110
Mr. Future Lawyer
and Mr. Future Banker?

09:10.190 --> 09:12.780
Okay, so I don't like it
any more than you do.

09:12.860 --> 09:14.990
Well, just don't tell me
how to talk to my father.

09:15.030 --> 09:17.990
- You guys are the same way.
- All right, all right. Jesus.

09:18.040 --> 09:20.160
- So what are you gonna do then?
- What I have to do.

09:20.250 --> 09:23.790
- Drop the annual.
- I wouldn't lose much sleep over it.

09:23.880 --> 09:26.340
It's just a bunch of jerks
trying to impress Nolan.

09:26.420 --> 09:29.510
I don't care. I don't
give a damn about any of it.

09:29.550 --> 09:33.340
- Well, uh... Latin, 8:00 in my room?
- Yes.

09:33.380 --> 09:36.470
- That sounds okay.
- Todd, you're welcome to join us.

09:36.550 --> 09:39.020
- Yeah, come along, pal.
- Thanks.

10:16.760 --> 10:19.390
Slow down, boys!

10:19.430 --> 10:23.890
Slow down, you horrible
phalanx of pubescence!

10:23.940 --> 10:27.900
Pick three laboratory experiments
from the project list...

10:27.940 --> 10:31.730
and report on them
every five weeks.

10:31.780 --> 10:36.240
The first 20 questions at the end
of chapter one are due tomorrow.

10:38.410 --> 10:40.330
- Agricolam.
- Agricolam.

10:40.410 --> 10:42.330
- Agricola.
- Agricola.

10:42.410 --> 10:44.750
- Agricolae.
- Agricolae.

10:44.790 --> 10:47.580
- Agricolarum.
- Agricolarum.

10:47.630 --> 10:49.920
- Agricolis.
- Agricolis.

10:49.960 --> 10:52.090
- Agricolas.
- Agricolas.

10:52.130 --> 10:54.420
- Agricolis.
- Agricolis.

10:54.470 --> 10:57.340
- Again, please. Agricola.
- Agricola.

10:57.430 --> 11:03.180
Your study of trigonometry
requires absolute precision.

11:03.270 --> 11:08.020
Anyone failing to turn in
any homework assignment...

11:08.100 --> 11:13.190
will be penalized one point
off their final grade.

11:13.280 --> 11:17.160
Let me urge you now not
to test me on this point.

11:28.670 --> 11:30.920
Hey, Spaz. Spaz.

11:31.000 --> 11:33.550
Brain damage!

11:33.630 --> 11:37.220
Shh!

11:54.690 --> 11:57.610
Well, come on.

12:04.910 --> 12:08.000
- Let's go.
- Let's go, guys.

12:08.080 --> 12:13.380
Let's go.

12:32.770 --> 12:36.360
"Oh, Captain, my Captain."

12:36.440 --> 12:39.650
Who knows
where that comes from?

12:39.740 --> 12:41.360
Anybody?

12:45.620 --> 12:47.910
Not a clue?

12:47.950 --> 12:51.920
It's from a poem by Walt Whitman
about Mr. Abraham Lincoln.

12:51.960 --> 12:55.040
Now in this class you can
either call me Mr. Keating...

12:55.130 --> 12:59.130
or, if you're slightly more daring,
"Oh, Captain, my Captain."

13:02.930 --> 13:06.010
Now, let me dispel a few rumors
so they don't fester into facts.

13:06.100 --> 13:09.850
Yes, I, too, attended Hell-ton
and survived.

13:09.930 --> 13:14.020
And, no, at that time, I was not
the mental giant you see before you.

13:14.110 --> 13:17.690
I was the intellectual equivalent
of a 98-pound weakling.

13:17.780 --> 13:21.700
I would go to the beach, and people
would kick copies of Byron in my face.

13:25.070 --> 13:30.540
Now... Mr. Pitts?

13:30.620 --> 13:32.670
That's a rather
unfortunate name.

13:32.750 --> 13:36.170
Mr. Pitts, where are you?

13:36.250 --> 13:40.720
Mr. Pitts, would you open
your hymnal to page 542.

13:40.800 --> 13:43.890
Read the first stanza
of the poem you find there.

13:46.430 --> 13:49.060
"To the Virgins
to Make Much of Time"?

13:49.140 --> 13:52.310
Yes, that's the one.

13:52.390 --> 13:55.230
Somewhat appropriate, isn't it?

13:55.310 --> 13:57.860
"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.

13:57.940 --> 13:59.860
"Old Time is still a-flying.

13:59.940 --> 14:03.360
And this same flower that smiles today,
tomorrow will be dying."

14:03.450 --> 14:06.490
Thank you, Mr. Pitts.

14:06.570 --> 14:09.660
"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may."

14:09.740 --> 14:13.500
The Latin term for that sentiment
is "Carpe diem."

14:13.580 --> 14:15.920
Now, who knows what that means?

14:17.290 --> 14:19.750
Carpe diem.
That's "Seize the day."

14:19.840 --> 14:21.760
- Very good, Mister-
- Meeks.

14:21.840 --> 14:25.050
Meeks.
Another unusual name.

14:25.130 --> 14:27.350
Seize the day.

14:27.430 --> 14:31.020
"Gather ye rosebuds while ye may."

14:31.100 --> 14:33.390
Why does the writer
use these lines?

14:33.480 --> 14:36.350
- Because he's in a hurry.
- No! Ding!

14:36.400 --> 14:38.690
Thank you
for playing anyway.

14:40.610 --> 14:44.200
Because we are food
for worms, lads.

14:44.280 --> 14:47.070
Because, believe it or not,
each and every one of us in this room...

14:47.160 --> 14:52.620
is one day going to stop breathing,
turn cold and die.

14:54.460 --> 14:57.040
I would like you
to step forward over here...

14:57.130 --> 14:59.710
and peruse some of the faces
from the past.

14:59.790 --> 15:04.170
You've walked past them
many times. I don't think
you've really looked at them.

15:09.890 --> 15:12.520
They're not that different
from you, are they?

15:12.600 --> 15:15.310
Same haircuts.

15:15.390 --> 15:18.520
Full of hormones,
just like you.

15:18.560 --> 15:24.030
Invincible, just like you feel.
The world is their oyster.

15:24.070 --> 15:27.200
They believe they're destined for
great things, just like many of you.

15:27.280 --> 15:29.570
Their eyes are full of hope,
just like you.

15:29.620 --> 15:32.330
Did they wait
until it was too late...

15:32.410 --> 15:35.870
to make from their lives even one iota
of what they were capable?

15:35.910 --> 15:41.040
Because, you see, gentlemen, these
boys are now fertilizing daffodils.

15:42.710 --> 15:45.630
But if you listen
real close...

15:45.720 --> 15:48.630
you can hear them whisper
their legacy to you.

15:48.720 --> 15:50.640
Go on, lean in.

15:50.720 --> 15:56.390
Listen.
Do you hear it?

16:02.770 --> 16:05.030
Carpe.

16:07.490 --> 16:10.320
Hear it?

16:10.410 --> 16:15.790
Carpe.

16:15.830 --> 16:21.170
Carpe diem.

16:21.250 --> 16:26.010
Seize the day, boys.

16:26.090 --> 16:31.590
Make your lives
extraordinary.

16:44.940 --> 16:47.690
- That was weird.
- But different.

16:47.780 --> 16:50.360
Spooky, if you ask me.

16:50.450 --> 16:52.530
Think he'll test us
on that stuff?

16:52.620 --> 16:55.700
Oh, come on, Cameron.
Don't you get anything?

16:55.790 --> 16:57.870
What? What?

17:00.160 --> 17:04.000
Let's go, boys. Hustle up in here.
That means you, Dalton!

17:04.040 --> 17:06.339
Who's up for a quick
study group tonight, guys?

17:06.380 --> 17:08.460
- Me.
- What?

17:08.550 --> 17:12.010
I can't make it, guys. I have to have
dinner at the Danburrys' house tonight.

17:12.050 --> 17:14.010
The Danburrys?
Who are the Danburrys?

17:14.050 --> 17:16.010
Big alums.
How'd you swing that?

17:16.060 --> 17:18.520
Friends of my dad's. They're probably
in their nineties or something.

17:18.560 --> 17:20.020
Ooh!

17:20.060 --> 17:22.520
Anything's better
than Hell-ton hash, Knox.

17:22.560 --> 17:25.150
- I'll second that.
- Yeah, we'll see.

17:25.230 --> 17:29.030
You coming to the study group tonight?

17:29.070 --> 17:33.030
Uh... no. No, I...
Uh, I've got some history I wanna do.

17:33.070 --> 17:35.870
Suit yourself.

18:08.900 --> 18:10.820
Ready, Overstreet?

18:12.900 --> 18:15.200
Ready to go, sir.

18:40.060 --> 18:42.520
Chet, can you get that?

18:42.600 --> 18:44.690
- I can't, Mom.
- I'll get it!

18:50.020 --> 18:52.650
Can I help you?

18:52.740 --> 18:56.360
Hi. Knox Overstreet.

18:56.450 --> 19:00.200
- Uh, Dr. Hager.
- Hi.

19:00.280 --> 19:02.120
This is the Danburrys',
right?

19:02.200 --> 19:05.500
- Are you here to see Chet?
- Mrs. Danburry?

19:05.580 --> 19:09.670
- No.
- Sorry. Thank you. I'm Mrs. Danburry.

19:09.750 --> 19:11.670
- You must be Knox.
- Yes.

19:11.750 --> 19:14.550
Back by 9:00?
Please, come on in.

19:14.630 --> 19:16.550
- Chris, come on!
- Chet, I'm coming.

19:16.630 --> 19:18.970
Knox. How are you?
Joe Danburry.

19:19.050 --> 19:21.810
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- He's the spitting image of his father.

19:21.890 --> 19:23.810
- How is he? Come on in.
- Chris!

19:23.890 --> 19:26.480
- Great. He just did a big case for G.M.
- I know where you're headed.

19:26.560 --> 19:28.940
- I'm coming.
- Like father, like son, huh?

19:30.570 --> 19:32.530
Ooh! Psycho!

19:32.610 --> 19:35.110
- Yes!
- To Queen-Six.

19:35.190 --> 19:37.820
- Another game?
- What do you mean?
- Duh!

19:37.910 --> 19:41.160
Just replace these numbers here
with "x," for "x" and "y."

19:41.240 --> 19:43.790
- Of course.
- Of course. So what's the problem?

19:43.870 --> 19:46.580
You think I can get in there?
You've been hogging it all day.

19:46.660 --> 19:48.750
- Wait. No.
- How was dinner?

19:48.830 --> 19:50.840
Huh?

19:50.920 --> 19:54.630
- How was dinner?
- Terrible.

19:56.010 --> 19:59.680
- Awful.
- Why? What happened?

20:02.600 --> 20:07.190
Tonight, I met
the most beautiful girl...

20:07.270 --> 20:09.690
I have ever seen
in my entire life.

20:09.770 --> 20:12.520
Are you crazy?
What's wrong with that?

20:12.570 --> 20:16.690
She's practically engaged
to Chet Danburry.

20:16.780 --> 20:18.450
That guy could eat a football.

20:18.530 --> 20:20.620
- Too bad.
- "Too bad"?

20:20.700 --> 20:23.200
It's worse than "too bad,"
Pittsie. It's a tragedy.

20:23.280 --> 20:26.040
A girl this beautiful
in love with such a jerk.

20:26.120 --> 20:28.620
All the good ones go for jerks.
You know that.

20:28.710 --> 20:31.210
Yeah, forget her. Open your trig book
and try and figure out problem five.

20:31.290 --> 20:33.710
I can't just forget her, Cameron.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.710
And I certainly
can't think about trig.

20:36.760 --> 20:38.930
We got it!

20:39.010 --> 20:41.760
All right, gentlemen.
Five minutes.

20:41.840 --> 20:44.310
Let's go.

20:44.390 --> 20:48.060
Did you see her naked? - Very funny, Dalton.

20:48.140 --> 20:51.150
That wouldn't be a radio in your lap,

20:51.230 --> 20:55.610
- would it, Mr. Pitts?
- No, sir. Science experiment.

20:55.690 --> 20:57.820
Radar.

21:02.240 --> 21:07.200
Gentlemen, open your text
to page 21 of the introduction.

21:07.250 --> 21:10.710
Mr. Perry, will you read
the opening paragraph of the preface,

21:10.750 --> 21:12.920
entitled
"Understanding Poetry."

21:14.250 --> 21:19.050
"Understand Poetry" by
Dr. J. Evans Pritchard, Ph. D.

21:19.090 --> 21:21.880
"To fully understand poetry,
we must first be fluent...

21:21.930 --> 21:24.890
"with its meter, rhyme
and figures of speech.

21:24.930 --> 21:26.890
"Then ask two questions.

21:26.930 --> 21:29.230
"One: How artfully has the objective
of the poem been rendered?

21:29.270 --> 21:32.770
"And, two: How important
is that objective?

21:32.850 --> 21:34.770
"Question one rates
the poem's perfection.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.900
"Question two rates
its importance.

21:36.940 --> 21:39.400
"And once these questions
have been answered...

21:39.440 --> 21:42.910
"determining a poem's greatness
becomes a relatively simple matter.

21:42.950 --> 21:45.580
"If the poem's score
for perfection is plotted...

21:45.620 --> 21:47.740
"on the horizontal
of a graph...

21:47.790 --> 21:51.250
"and its importance
is plotted on the vertical,

21:51.290 --> 21:54.580
"then calculating
the total area of the poem...

21:54.630 --> 21:57.380
"yields the measure
of its greatness.

21:59.920 --> 22:05.180
"A sonnet by Byron might
score high on the vertical,

22:05.260 --> 22:08.180
"but only average
on the horizontal.

22:08.260 --> 22:11.480
"A Shakespearean sonnet,
on the other hand,

22:11.560 --> 22:14.940
"would score high both
horizontally and vertically,

22:14.980 --> 22:16.940
"yielding
a massive total area;

22:16.980 --> 22:20.320
"thereby revealing
the poem to be truly great.

22:20.400 --> 22:25.200
"As you proceed through the poetry in
this book, practice this rating method.

22:25.280 --> 22:27.990
"As your ability to evaluate
poems in this manner grows,

22:28.080 --> 22:33.870
so will... so will your enjoyment
and understanding of poetry."

22:38.290 --> 22:40.250
Excrement.

22:42.630 --> 22:45.010
That's what I think
of Mr. J. Evans Pritchard.

22:45.090 --> 22:48.260
We're not laying pipe.
We're talking about poetry.

22:48.350 --> 22:51.560
I mean, how can you describe poetry
like American Bandstand?

22:51.640 --> 22:56.520
"I like Byron. I give him a 42.
But I can't dance to it."

22:56.600 --> 22:59.690
Now, I want you
to rip out that page.

22:59.770 --> 23:03.190
Go on.
Rip out the entire page.

23:05.780 --> 23:08.370
You heard me.
Rip it out.

23:08.450 --> 23:10.910
Rip it out!

23:10.990 --> 23:13.160
Go on.
Rip it out.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.960
Thank you, Mr. Dalton.

23:17.040 --> 23:19.000
Gentlemen, tell you what.
Don't just tear out that page.

23:19.090 --> 23:23.920
Tear out the entire introduction.
I want it gone, history. Leave nothing.

23:24.010 --> 23:28.340
Rip it out! Rip! Be gone,
J. Evans Pritchard, Ph. D.!

23:28.390 --> 23:30.890
Rip! Shred! Tear!

23:30.930 --> 23:33.980
Rip it out! I want to hear nothing
but ripping of Mr. Pritchard!

23:34.060 --> 23:36.810
We'll perforate it, put it on a roll!

23:36.890 --> 23:39.310
It's not the Bible.
You're not gonna go to hell for this.

23:41.820 --> 23:45.320
Go on. Make a clean tear.
I want nothing left of it.

23:45.400 --> 23:47.740
We shouldn't be doing this.

23:47.820 --> 23:50.280
Rip! Rip! Rip!

23:50.370 --> 23:52.290
Rip it out! Rip!

23:56.580 --> 24:00.590
Rip it! Yeah! Rip it out!

24:04.170 --> 24:07.220
- Rip it!
- What the hell is going on here?

24:08.590 --> 24:12.140
- I don't hear enough rips.
- Mr. Keating.

24:12.220 --> 24:14.600
Mr. McAllister.

24:14.680 --> 24:19.230
I'm sorry, I...
I didn't know you were here.

24:19.270 --> 24:25.190
- I am.
- Ah. So you are.

24:25.280 --> 24:27.360
Excuse me.

24:29.110 --> 24:31.410
Keep ripping, gentlemen.

24:31.450 --> 24:34.200
This is a battle, a war.

24:34.290 --> 24:36.370
And the casualties could be
your hearts and souls.

24:36.450 --> 24:38.370
Thank you, Mr. Dalton.

24:38.460 --> 24:41.540
Armies of academics
going forward measuring poetry.

24:41.630 --> 24:43.540
No! We will not
have that here.

24:43.630 --> 24:45.550
No more
of Mr. J. Evans Pritchard.

24:45.630 --> 24:48.880
Now, my class, you will learn
to think for yourselves again.

24:48.970 --> 24:52.470
You will learn
to savor words and language.

24:52.550 --> 24:54.890
No matter what
anybody tells you,

24:54.970 --> 24:58.730
words and ideas
can change the world.

24:58.810 --> 25:01.150
I see that look
in Mr. Pitts' eye...

25:01.230 --> 25:03.480
like 19th century literature
has nothing to do...

25:03.560 --> 25:05.480
with going to business school
or medical school.

25:05.570 --> 25:07.490
Right? Maybe.

25:07.570 --> 25:09.650
Mr. Hopkins, you may agree
with him, thinking,

25:09.740 --> 25:12.990
"Yes, we should simply study
our Mr. Pritchard...

25:13.070 --> 25:15.990
"and learn our rhyme and meter
and go quietly about the business...

25:16.080 --> 25:19.160
of achieving other ambitions."

25:19.250 --> 25:22.170
I have a little secret for you.
Huddle up.

25:22.250 --> 25:24.170
Huddle up!

25:32.090 --> 25:35.510
We don't read and write
poetry because it's cute.

25:35.600 --> 25:40.350
We read and write poetry because
we are members of the human race.

25:40.440 --> 25:45.190
And the human race
is filled with passion.

25:45.270 --> 25:47.860
Medicine, law,
business, engineering;

25:47.940 --> 25:51.150
these are noble pursuits
and necessary to sustain life.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.700
But poetry,

25:53.780 --> 25:57.870
beauty, romance, love;

25:57.950 --> 26:00.540
these are what
we stay alive for.

26:00.620 --> 26:03.500
To quote from Whitman:

26:03.540 --> 26:07.590
"O me, O life of the questions
of these recurring.

26:07.670 --> 26:10.760
"Of the endless trains
of the faithless.

26:10.840 --> 26:13.800
"Of cities filled
with the foolish.

26:13.890 --> 26:17.180
"What good amid these,
O me, O life?

26:17.220 --> 26:21.180
"Answer:
That you are here.

26:21.230 --> 26:25.350
"That life exists
and identity.

26:25.400 --> 26:27.860
"That the powerful play
goes on,

26:27.900 --> 26:30.530
and you may contribute
a verse."

26:32.570 --> 26:35.240
"That the powerful play
goes on,

26:35.320 --> 26:39.200
and you may contribute
a verse."

26:42.750 --> 26:44.870
What will your verse be?

26:48.920 --> 26:51.710
For what we are
about to receive,

26:51.760 --> 26:54.880
may the Lord make us
truly grateful.

26:54.930 --> 26:56.890
Amen.

27:08.560 --> 27:11.320
Quite an interesting class
you gave today, Mr. Keating.

27:11.400 --> 27:14.320
- Sorry if I shocked you, Mr. McAllister.
- There's no need to apologize.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.490
It was very fascinating,
misguided though it was.

27:17.570 --> 27:19.490
You think so?

27:19.580 --> 27:22.830
You take a big risk by encouraging them
to become artists, John.

27:22.910 --> 27:26.670
When they realize that they're
not Rembrandts, Shakespeares or Mozarts,

27:26.750 --> 27:28.330
they'll hate you for it.

27:28.420 --> 27:31.840
We're not talking artists, George.
We're talking freethinkers.

27:31.920 --> 27:34.340
Freethinkers at 17?

27:34.420 --> 27:36.380
Funny, I never pegged you
as a cynic.

27:38.760 --> 27:41.470
Not a cynic.

27:41.560 --> 27:43.520
A realist.

27:43.600 --> 27:47.690
"Show me the heart unfettered
by foolish dreams,

27:47.770 --> 27:49.980
and I'll show you
a happy man."

27:50.060 --> 27:53.690
"But only in their dreams
can men be truly free.

27:53.780 --> 27:56.780
'Twas always thus,
and always thus will be."

27:56.820 --> 27:58.870
Tennyson?

27:58.950 --> 28:01.120
No. Keating.

28:05.960 --> 28:08.540
Hey, I found his senior
annual in the library.

28:08.620 --> 28:11.670
Listen to this.
Captain of the soccer team.

28:11.750 --> 28:14.670
Editor of the school annual.
Cambridge bound.

28:14.760 --> 28:17.970
Thigh man
and the Dead Poets Society.

28:18.010 --> 28:20.760
"Man Most Likely
To Do Anything."

28:20.850 --> 28:24.180
Thigh man?
Mr. "K" was a hell-raiser.

28:24.270 --> 28:26.980
What's the Dead Poets Society?

28:27.060 --> 28:29.020
- I don't know.
- Is there a picture in the annual?

28:29.060 --> 28:31.020
- Nothing. No other mention of it.
- That boy there,

28:31.060 --> 28:33.020
see me after lunch.

28:36.570 --> 28:38.530
Mr. Keating?

28:38.570 --> 28:41.320
Mr. Keating?

28:41.370 --> 28:43.950
Sir?

28:44.040 --> 28:46.750
- Say something.
- Oh, Captain, my Captain?

28:46.830 --> 28:49.330
Gentlemen.

28:49.420 --> 28:53.000
We were just looking
in your old annual.

28:53.090 --> 28:55.380
Oh, my God.

28:55.460 --> 28:58.880
No, that's not me.

28:58.930 --> 29:01.890
Stanley "The Tool" Wilson.

29:04.390 --> 29:08.060
- God.
- What was the Dead Poets Society?

29:12.400 --> 29:15.940
I doubt the present administration
would look too favorably upon that.

29:16.030 --> 29:18.690
Why?
What was it?

29:21.570 --> 29:25.740
- Gentlemen, can you keep a secret?
- Sure.

29:28.040 --> 29:33.670
The Dead Poets were dedicated
to sucking the marrow out of life.

29:33.750 --> 29:37.000
That's a phrase from Thoreau we'd invoke
at the beginning of every meeting.

29:37.090 --> 29:39.670
You see, we would gather
at the old Indian cave...

29:39.760 --> 29:44.260
and take turns reading from Thoreau,
Whitman, Shelley; the biggies.

29:44.350 --> 29:46.140
Even some of our own verse.

29:46.220 --> 29:49.890
And in the enchantment of the moment,
we'd let poetry work its magic.

29:49.930 --> 29:53.150
You mean it was a bunch of guys
sitting around, reading poetry?

29:53.230 --> 29:56.190
No, Mr. Overstreet.
It wasn't just guys.

29:56.270 --> 29:59.530
We weren't a Greek organization.
We were romantics.

29:59.610 --> 30:04.620
We didn't just read poetry, we let it
drip from our tongues, like honey.

30:04.700 --> 30:09.370
Spirits soared, women swooned
and gods were created, gentlemen.

30:09.450 --> 30:11.910
Not a bad way
to spend an evening, eh?

30:11.960 --> 30:13.290
Hmm.

30:13.370 --> 30:16.210
Thank you, Mr. Perry,
for this stroll down amnesia lane.

30:16.290 --> 30:18.300
Burn that.

30:18.380 --> 30:21.220
Especially my picture.

30:21.300 --> 30:26.720
Dead Poets Society.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.770
What?

30:32.640 --> 30:34.900
- I say we go tonight.
- Tonight?

30:34.980 --> 30:37.070
- Wait a minute.
- Everybody in?

30:37.150 --> 30:39.230
- Where's this cave he's talking about?
- It's beyond the stream.

30:39.320 --> 30:41.740
- I know where it is.
- That's miles.

30:41.820 --> 30:44.990
- Sounds boring to me.
- Don't go.

30:45.070 --> 30:47.580
- You know how many
demerits we're talking?
- So don't come. Please.

30:47.660 --> 30:50.080
Look, all I'm saying
is that we have to be careful.

30:50.160 --> 30:53.290
- We can't get caught.
- No shit, Sherlock.

30:53.330 --> 30:56.250
You boys there!
Hurry up!

30:56.330 --> 30:59.380
- All right, who's in?
- Aw, come on, Neil. Hager's...

30:59.460 --> 31:02.840
Forget Hager! No!
Who's in?

31:02.920 --> 31:04.800
I'm in.

31:05.930 --> 31:08.550
I'm warning you! Move!

31:08.640 --> 31:09.810
Me too.

31:09.850 --> 31:12.270
- I don't know, Neil.
- What? Pitts!

31:12.350 --> 31:14.270
- Pittsie, come on.
- His grades are hurting.

31:14.350 --> 31:17.020
- You can help him, Meeks.
- What is this, a midnight study group?

31:17.110 --> 31:19.860
Forget it, Pitts. You're coming.
Meeks, your grades hurting too?

31:19.940 --> 31:22.320
- I'll try anything once.
- Except sex.

31:22.360 --> 31:24.700
- Ha, ha, ha.
- I'm in as long as we're careful.

31:24.780 --> 31:27.370
- What about you, Knox?
- I don't know, Charlie.

31:27.450 --> 31:29.530
Come on, Knox.
It'll help you get Chris.

31:29.620 --> 31:31.540
Yeah? How?

31:31.620 --> 31:35.370
- Women swoon.
- But why do they swoon?

31:35.460 --> 31:38.960
Charlie, tell me why they swoon!
Charlie!

31:41.460 --> 31:43.970
Okay,
follow the stream to the waterfall.

31:44.050 --> 31:45.970
It's right there.
It's got to be on the banks.

31:46.050 --> 31:47.970
I don't know.
This is starting to sound dangerous.

31:48.050 --> 31:51.430
- Oh, well, why don't you stay home?
- Hey, you're crazy.

31:51.510 --> 31:55.390
For God's sake,
stop chattering and sit down.

32:02.400 --> 32:05.110
- Todd, are you coming tonight?
- No.

32:05.190 --> 32:07.280
Why not? God, you were there.
You heard Keating.

32:07.360 --> 32:09.740
- Don't you want
to do something about that?
- Yes.

32:09.820 --> 32:14.160
- But...
- But? But what?

32:15.910 --> 32:19.710
Keating said that everybody
took turns reading,

32:19.750 --> 32:22.550
and I don't want to do that.

32:22.590 --> 32:24.760
Gosh, you really have
a problem with that, don't you?

32:26.920 --> 32:29.390
N-No, I don't have a problem.

32:29.430 --> 32:32.760
Neil, I just...
I don't want to do it, okay?

32:32.850 --> 32:35.390
All right.

32:35.430 --> 32:39.060
What if you didn't have to read?
What if you just came and listened?

32:39.100 --> 32:42.230
- That's not how it works.
- Well, forget how it works.

32:42.270 --> 32:46.240
What if...
What if they said it was okay?

32:46.280 --> 32:49.160
What... What, are you gonna
go up and ask them?

32:49.240 --> 32:51.990
No. No, Neil.

32:52.080 --> 32:54.290
- I'll be right back.
- Neil. Neil!

32:57.040 --> 33:00.420
Oh, shut up, will you?

33:02.460 --> 33:04.500
That's for my asthma, okay?

33:04.590 --> 33:07.170
Could you give that back, please?

33:07.260 --> 33:09.180
What's the matter?
Don't you like snakes?

33:09.260 --> 33:11.340
- You're in.
- Get away from me, okay?

33:11.430 --> 33:14.850
Why don't you check your pocket, huh?

33:14.930 --> 33:18.680
- Come on. I have to brush my teeth.
- Get a... Get off.

33:18.770 --> 33:22.690
Cut out that racket in there!

34:24.580 --> 34:29.170
Go. Go.

36:02.560 --> 36:05.100
- I'm a dead poet!
- Aw, shit, Charlie.

36:05.140 --> 36:09.020
- Guys! Over here!
- Funny. You're real funny.

36:09.150 --> 36:11.150
It's too wet.

36:11.230 --> 36:13.150
God, are you trying
to smoke us out of here?

36:13.230 --> 36:15.320
No, no. The smoke's
going right up this opening.

36:18.490 --> 36:21.160
You okay?

36:21.240 --> 36:23.660
Oh, God. Clowns.

36:23.750 --> 36:26.330
All right, forget the fire.

36:26.410 --> 36:29.500
Let's go, gentlemen.

36:29.580 --> 36:33.630
I hereby reconvene
the Dead Poets Society,

36:33.710 --> 36:36.010
Welton Chapter.

36:36.090 --> 36:38.010
The meetings will be
conducted by myself...

36:38.090 --> 36:40.180
and the other
new initiates now present.

36:40.260 --> 36:42.310
Todd Anderson, because
he prefers not to read,

36:42.390 --> 36:44.890
will keep minutes
of the meetings.

36:44.970 --> 36:48.020
I'll now read
the traditional opening message...

36:48.100 --> 36:50.020
by Society member
Henry David Thoreau.

36:50.100 --> 36:53.020
"I went to the woods because
I wanted to live deliberately.

36:53.110 --> 36:55.820
I wanted to live deep and suck
out all the marrow of life."

36:55.860 --> 36:57.490
I'll second that.

36:57.530 --> 37:00.030
"To put to rout
all that was not life.

37:00.110 --> 37:01.990
"And not,
when I had come to die,

37:02.030 --> 37:04.450
discover
that I had not lived."

37:08.000 --> 37:11.080
- Keating's marked
a bunch of other pages.
- All right, intermission!

37:11.170 --> 37:13.340
Dig deep. Right here.
Right here, lay it down.

37:13.380 --> 37:15.510
On the mud? We're gonna
put our food on the mud?

37:15.550 --> 37:17.840
Meeks, put your coat down.
Picnic blanket.

37:17.880 --> 37:20.840
Use Meeks' coat.

37:20.890 --> 37:22.850
Don't keep anything back either.

37:22.890 --> 37:25.680
- You guys are always bumming my smokes.
- Raisins?

37:25.720 --> 37:27.680
- Yuck.
- Wait a minute!

37:27.730 --> 37:30.850
- Who gave us half a roll?
- I'm eating the other half.

37:30.900 --> 37:33.730
- Come on!
- What, you want me to put it back?

37:33.770 --> 37:36.860
It was a dark and rainy night,
and this old lady,

37:36.900 --> 37:39.200
who had a passion
for jigsaw puzzles,

37:39.240 --> 37:43.780
sat by herself in her house at her table
to complete a new jigsaw puzzle.

37:43.870 --> 37:46.700
But as she pieced
the puzzle together,

37:46.740 --> 37:48.700
she realized,
to her astonishment,

37:48.750 --> 37:52.210
that the image that was formed
was her very own room.

37:52.250 --> 37:54.540
And the figure
in the center of the puzzle,

37:54.590 --> 37:57.210
as she completed it,
was herself.

37:57.260 --> 38:01.300
And with trembling hands,
she placed the last four pieces...

38:01.380 --> 38:06.470
and stared in horror at the face
of a demented madman at the window.

38:06.560 --> 38:10.480
The last thing that
this old lady ever heard...

38:10.560 --> 38:13.310
- was the sound of breaking glass.
- No, she didn't.

38:13.400 --> 38:16.150
Yes, this is true. This is true.

38:16.230 --> 38:18.820
I've got one that's better than that.

38:18.900 --> 38:21.280
I do. There's a young,
married couple,

38:21.320 --> 38:23.820
and they're driving through the forest
at night on a long trip.

38:23.910 --> 38:26.490
And they run out of gas,
and there's a madman on the-

38:26.580 --> 38:27.990
The thing with the hand?

38:28.080 --> 38:30.000
I love that story!

38:30.080 --> 38:32.000
- I told you that one.
- You did not.

38:32.080 --> 38:34.170
- I got that in camp in sixth grade.
- Last year?

38:34.250 --> 38:36.340
"In a mean abode
in the Shanking Road,

38:36.420 --> 38:38.340
"lived a man named
William Bloat.

38:38.420 --> 38:40.510
"Now, he had a wife,
the plague of his life,

38:40.590 --> 38:42.680
"who continually
got his goat.

38:42.760 --> 38:45.180
"And one day at dawn,
with her nightshift on,

38:45.260 --> 38:47.510
he slit
her bloody throat."

38:47.600 --> 38:49.350
Oh, and it gets worse.

38:49.430 --> 38:51.680
You want to hear
a real poem?

38:51.770 --> 38:53.850
- You want this?
- No, I don't need... Get this outta here.

38:53.940 --> 38:55.860
- What, did you bring one?
- You memorized a poem?

38:55.940 --> 38:58.690
You memorized a poem?

38:58.780 --> 39:01.150
- An original piece by Charlie Dalton.
- An original piece.

39:01.190 --> 39:03.610
- Take center stage.
- You know, this is history, right?

39:11.500 --> 39:14.120
Wow. Whoa.

39:14.170 --> 39:16.420
Where did you get that?

39:16.500 --> 39:17.790
Where did you...

39:17.840 --> 39:20.840
- Whoa.
- "Teach me to love?

39:20.880 --> 39:23.840
"Go teach thyself more wit.

39:23.880 --> 39:26.180
"I chief professor am of it.

39:26.220 --> 39:30.010
"The god of love,
if such a thing there be,

39:30.060 --> 39:32.140
may learn to love from me."

39:32.230 --> 39:34.230
Wow. Did you write that?

39:39.400 --> 39:41.610
Abraham Cowley.

39:41.690 --> 39:43.610
Okay.
Who's next?

39:43.690 --> 39:46.030
Alfred Lord Tennyson.

39:46.070 --> 39:48.160
"Come, my friends.

39:48.240 --> 39:51.200
"'Tis not too late
to seek a newer world.

39:51.240 --> 39:54.830
"For my purpose holds
to sail beyond the sunset.

39:54.910 --> 39:57.210
"And though we are not
now that strength...

39:57.250 --> 40:01.050
"which in old days
moved Earth and heaven.

40:01.090 --> 40:03.380
"That which we are, we are:

40:03.420 --> 40:07.510
"One equal temper
of heroic hearts...

40:07.590 --> 40:11.560
"made weak by time and fate,
but strong in will...

40:11.600 --> 40:16.690
"to strive, to seek, to find,

40:16.770 --> 40:19.230
and not to yield."

40:20.400 --> 40:23.030
"Then I had religion,
then I had a vision.

40:23.110 --> 40:25.570
"I could not turn from
their revel in derision.

40:25.610 --> 40:28.200
"Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black,

40:28.280 --> 40:31.160
cutting through the forest
with a golden track."

40:31.240 --> 40:33.870
- Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black,
- Meeks. Meeks.

40:33.950 --> 40:36.410
cutting through the forest
with a golden track.

40:36.460 --> 40:38.920
Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black,

40:38.960 --> 40:41.630
cutting through the forest
with a golden track.

40:41.710 --> 40:44.090
Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black,

40:44.130 --> 40:46.590
cutting through the forest
with a golden track!

40:46.630 --> 40:49.090
Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black,

40:49.140 --> 40:52.010
cutting through the forest
with a golden track!

40:52.100 --> 40:54.220
Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black,

40:54.310 --> 40:56.600
cutting through the forest
with a golden track!

40:56.640 --> 40:59.100
Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black,

40:59.150 --> 41:01.690
cutting through the forest
with a golden track!

41:01.770 --> 41:04.030
Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black,

41:04.110 --> 41:06.360
cutting through the forest
with a golden track!

41:09.110 --> 41:11.370
Cutting through the forest
with a golden track!

41:11.450 --> 41:14.330
Then I saw the Congo
creeping through the black...

41:22.790 --> 41:25.710
A man is not "very tired."
He is "exhausted."

41:25.800 --> 41:27.720
And don't use "very sad."
Use...

41:27.800 --> 41:30.050
Come on, Mr. Overstreet,
you twerp.

41:30.130 --> 41:33.550
- "Morose"?
- Exactly! Morose!

41:33.640 --> 41:37.480
Language was developed for one endeavor,
and that is... Mr. Anderson?

41:37.520 --> 41:40.730
Come on,
are you a man or an amoeba?

41:43.190 --> 41:45.190
Mr. Perry?

41:47.490 --> 41:50.110
Uh... to communicate.

41:50.200 --> 41:53.030
No! To woo women.

41:53.120 --> 41:55.580
Today we're going to be talking...

41:55.660 --> 41:58.410
- about William Shakespeare.
- Oh, God.

41:58.500 --> 42:00.420
I know. A lot of you
look forward to this...

42:00.500 --> 42:02.830
about as much as you look forward
to root canal work.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.960
We're gonna talk
about Shakespeare...

42:05.000 --> 42:07.630
as someone who writes
something very interesting.

42:07.710 --> 42:11.340
Now, many of you have seen Shakespeare
done very much like this:

42:11.430 --> 42:14.680
"O, Titus, bring your friend hither."

42:14.760 --> 42:17.680
But if any of you have seen
Mr. Marlon Brando,

42:17.770 --> 42:19.850
you know
that Shakespeare can be different.

42:19.930 --> 42:24.020
"Friends, Romans, countrymen,
lend me your ears."

42:26.770 --> 42:29.360
You can also imagine maybe
John Wayne as Macbeth going...

42:29.440 --> 42:33.450
"Well,
is this a dagger I see before me?"

42:35.660 --> 42:39.500
"Dogs, sir?
Oh, not just now.

42:39.540 --> 42:43.710
"I do enjoy a good dog
once in a while, sir.

42:43.790 --> 42:47.210
"You can have yourself
a three-course meal from one dog.

42:47.300 --> 42:51.470
"Start with a canine croquette.

42:51.550 --> 42:53.470
"Go to your Fido Flambe
for main course.

42:53.550 --> 42:56.390
"And for dessert,
a Pekingese parfait.

42:56.470 --> 42:58.600
And you can pick your teeth
with the little paw."

43:01.230 --> 43:03.310
Why do I stand up here?

43:03.390 --> 43:05.860
- Anybody?
- To feel taller.

43:05.900 --> 43:07.860
No! Thank you for playing.

43:07.900 --> 43:10.440
I stand upon my desk...

43:10.530 --> 43:15.700
to remind myself that we must constantly
look at things in a different way.

43:20.750 --> 43:23.040
See, the world looks
very different from up here.

43:23.080 --> 43:25.120
You don't believe me?

43:25.210 --> 43:28.710
Come see for yourselves.
Come on.

43:28.750 --> 43:32.220
Come on. Just when you
think you know something,

43:32.260 --> 43:34.220
you have to look at it
in another way.

43:34.260 --> 43:37.050
Even though it may seem
silly or wrong,

43:37.100 --> 43:39.060
you must try.

43:39.100 --> 43:41.520
Now when you read, don't just
consider what the author thinks.

43:41.600 --> 43:45.520
Consider what you think.

43:45.600 --> 43:49.070
Boys, you must strive
to find your own voice.

43:49.110 --> 43:51.070
Because the longer
you wait to begin,

43:51.110 --> 43:53.490
the less likely you are
to find it at all.

43:53.570 --> 43:56.910
Thoreau said, "Most men lead
lives of quiet desperation."

43:56.950 --> 44:00.490
Don't be resigned to that.
Break out.

44:00.580 --> 44:03.910
Don't just walk off the edge
like lemmings. Look around you.

44:03.960 --> 44:06.670
There you go, Mr. Priske. Thank you!

44:06.750 --> 44:08.840
Yes!

44:08.920 --> 44:13.170
Dare to strike out
and find new ground.

44:13.260 --> 44:15.840
Now, in addition to your essays,

44:15.930 --> 44:19.430
I would like you to compose
a poem of your own, an original work.

44:19.470 --> 44:24.060
Ooh!

44:24.140 --> 44:26.190
That's right.

44:26.270 --> 44:30.150
You have to deliver it aloud,
in front of the class on Monday.

44:30.190 --> 44:32.150
Bon chance, gentlemen.

44:33.820 --> 44:36.200
Mr. Anderson.

44:36.280 --> 44:41.370
Don't think I don't know this assignment
scares the hell out of you, you mole.

44:54.960 --> 44:57.340
Take a power train in two!

44:59.140 --> 45:02.310
- Three, keep your eyes in the boat!
- Stroke! Stroke!

45:02.390 --> 45:04.770
Stroke! Stroke!

45:04.850 --> 45:08.980
We got it, Pittsie.

45:09.060 --> 45:12.480
Radio Free America!

45:12.520 --> 45:15.530
Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll

45:15.570 --> 45:18.740
But movin' and a-groovin'
is gonna satisfy my soul

45:18.820 --> 45:20.990
Let's have a party
Oooh

45:21.070 --> 45:23.830
Let's have a party

45:23.910 --> 45:27.000
Let's spin it to the soul
Let's rock and roll

45:27.080 --> 45:29.830
Let's have a party tonight

45:29.920 --> 45:32.670
I never kissed a bear
I never kissed a goose

45:32.750 --> 45:34.840
But I can shake a chicken
in the middle of the room

45:34.920 --> 45:36.880
Let's have a party

45:39.590 --> 45:42.180
- I found it.
- You found what?

45:42.260 --> 45:45.560
What I want to do right now.
What's really, really inside of me.

45:45.600 --> 45:47.890
- "A Midsummer Night's Dream."
- This is it.

45:47.930 --> 45:50.850
- What is that?
- It's a play, dummy.

45:50.900 --> 45:53.440
I know that.
Wh-What does it have to do with you?

45:53.520 --> 45:55.530
All right, they're
putting it on at Henley Hall.

45:55.610 --> 45:57.990
Open tryouts.
Open tryouts!

45:58.070 --> 45:59.990
- Yeah, so?
- So!

46:00.070 --> 46:03.950
I'm gonna act.

46:04.030 --> 46:07.160
Yes! Yes!
I'm gonna be an actor!

46:07.250 --> 46:09.330
Ever since I can remember,
I've wanted to try this!

46:09.410 --> 46:11.330
I even tried to go
to summer stock auditions last year,

46:11.420 --> 46:13.500
but, of course,
my father wouldn't let me.

46:13.580 --> 46:17.000
For the first time in my whole life,
I know what I want to do.

46:17.090 --> 46:19.670
And for
the first time, I'm gonna do it...

46:19.760 --> 46:21.680
whether my father
wants me to or not!

46:21.760 --> 46:25.010
- Carpe diem!
- Neil, Neil, hold it.

46:25.100 --> 46:28.560
How are you gonna be in a play
if your father won't let you?

46:28.600 --> 46:31.350
First, I gotta get the part,
then I can worry about that.

46:31.440 --> 46:33.860
But won't he kill you if he finds out
you went to an audition
and didn't tell him?

46:33.940 --> 46:36.900
No, no, no. As far as I'm concerned,
he won't have to know about any of this.

46:36.940 --> 46:40.400
- Well, that's impossible.
- Bullshit. Nothing's impossible.

46:40.490 --> 46:43.160
Well, why don't you just call him
and ask him and m-maybe he'll say yes.

46:43.240 --> 46:45.870
That's a laugh.

46:45.950 --> 46:49.200
If I don't ask him,
at least I won't be disobeying him.

46:49.290 --> 46:52.080
- Yeah, but if he said no before...
- Jesus, Todd, whose side are you on?

47:03.220 --> 47:06.470
I mean, I haven't even
gotten the part yet.

47:06.550 --> 47:10.600
Can't I even enjoy the idea
for a little while?

47:19.900 --> 47:24.320
- You're coming to the meeting?
- I don't know. Maybe.

47:24.410 --> 47:28.830
Nothing Mr. Keating has to say
means shit to you, does it, Todd?

47:28.910 --> 47:31.160
- Wh-What is that supposed to mean?
- You're in the club!

47:31.250 --> 47:33.660
Being in the club means
being stirred up by things.

47:33.710 --> 47:35.670
You look about
as stirred up as a cesspool.

47:35.710 --> 47:39.170
- So you want me out?
- No, I want you in!

47:39.250 --> 47:42.170
But being in means you gotta do
something, not just say you're in.

47:42.220 --> 47:45.340
Listen, Neil, I mean,
I appreciate this concern,

47:45.430 --> 47:47.850
but I'm not like you,
all right?

47:47.930 --> 47:51.180
You-You-You say things
and people listen.

47:51.270 --> 47:53.270
I-I-I'm not like that.

47:53.350 --> 47:55.440
- Don't you think you could be?
- No.

47:55.520 --> 47:58.440
I-I-I don't know,
but that's not the point.

47:58.520 --> 48:02.820
The point is, there's nothing you can
do about it, so you can just butt out.

48:02.860 --> 48:05.280
I can take care
of myself just fine.

48:05.360 --> 48:07.490
All right?

48:09.530 --> 48:11.490
No.

48:14.370 --> 48:16.370
What do you mean, "no"?

48:17.540 --> 48:19.790
No.

48:19.880 --> 48:21.920
Give me that!
Neil!

48:22.000 --> 48:24.170
- Neil, give that back!
- "We are dreaming of a tomorrow..."

48:24.220 --> 48:26.180
- It's poetry!
- Neil!

48:26.220 --> 48:28.680
I'm being chased by Walt Whitman!

48:28.720 --> 48:30.850
Okay! Okay!

48:30.890 --> 48:33.680
What are you guys doing?
I'm trying... You see this chemistry...

48:33.720 --> 48:36.190
Hey. Give me... Neil, give me...

48:36.230 --> 48:38.190
Don't be immature. Come on!

48:38.230 --> 48:40.860
- I need my...
- Give it to me!

48:40.900 --> 48:43.190
Charlie!

48:43.230 --> 48:45.860
Let me have my book. I need my...

50:14.620 --> 50:19.040
Okay, everybody on the bus.

50:19.120 --> 50:22.580
Let's go, boys.

50:22.670 --> 50:24.790
Come on. Let's go. On the bus, boys.

50:24.880 --> 50:27.710
Now!

50:28.970 --> 50:30.720
Now, devotees may argue...

50:30.800 --> 50:34.390
that one sport or game
is inherently better than another.

50:34.470 --> 50:37.220
For me, sport
is actually a chance...

50:37.310 --> 50:40.810
for us to have other human beings
push us to excel.

50:40.890 --> 50:44.480
I want you all to come over here
and take a slip of paper...

50:44.560 --> 50:47.440
and line up single file.

50:47.530 --> 50:49.570
Mr. Meeks,
time to inherit the Earth.

50:49.650 --> 50:53.570
Mr. Pitts...
rise above your name.

50:53.660 --> 50:57.830
I want you to hand these out
to the boys, one apiece.

50:57.870 --> 51:01.500
You know what to do, Pitts!

51:01.580 --> 51:04.830
"Oh, to struggle against great odds,
to meet enemies undaunted."

51:04.920 --> 51:08.000
Sounds like you're daunted.
Say it again like you're undaunted.

51:08.090 --> 51:11.170
"Oh, to struggle against great odds,
to meet enemies undaunted"!

51:11.260 --> 51:13.630
Now go on!

51:13.720 --> 51:15.850
Yes! Next!

51:15.930 --> 51:21.230
"To be a sailor of the world
bound for all ports."

51:21.270 --> 51:23.730
Next. Louder!

51:23.770 --> 51:27.860
"Oh, I live to be the ruler of life,
not a slave."

51:27.900 --> 51:29.860
"To mount the scaffolds.

51:29.900 --> 51:33.150
To advance to the muzzles of guns
with perfect nonchalance."

51:38.280 --> 51:40.620
Come on, Meeks!
Listen to the music!

51:40.700 --> 51:44.710
"To dance, clap hands,
exalt, shout, skip,

51:44.790 --> 51:48.500
- roll on, float on!"
- Yes!

51:49.840 --> 51:52.970
"Oh, to have life henceforth,
the poem of new joys."

51:55.050 --> 51:57.430
Boo!

51:57.470 --> 51:59.890
Come on, Charlie,
let it fill your soul.

51:59.930 --> 52:02.350
"To indeed be a god!"

52:04.140 --> 52:06.850
Charlie, I got the part!

52:06.940 --> 52:08.860
I'm gonna play Puck!

52:08.940 --> 52:10.860
- I'm gonna play Puck!
- What did he say?

52:10.940 --> 52:12.860
- Puck you!
- The main part!

52:12.940 --> 52:14.860
- Great, Neil!
- Charlie, I got it!

52:14.950 --> 52:17.700
- Congratulations.
- Good for you! Good for you!

52:17.780 --> 52:21.040
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

52:21.120 --> 52:23.700
Neil, how are you gonna do this?

52:23.790 --> 52:27.710
They need a letter of permission
from my father and Mr. Nolan.

52:27.790 --> 52:30.380
- You're not gonna write it.
- Oh, yes, I am.

52:30.460 --> 52:33.710
Oh, Neil... Neil, you're crazy.

52:33.800 --> 52:35.930
Okay.

52:36.010 --> 52:39.720
I am writing to you...

52:39.800 --> 52:42.890
on behalf of...

52:42.970 --> 52:45.730
my son...

52:45.810 --> 52:48.730
Neil Perry.

52:48.810 --> 52:52.780
This is great!

53:42.120 --> 53:44.410
"To Chris."

53:44.490 --> 53:49.120
Who's Chris? Mmm, Chris.

53:49.210 --> 53:52.290
"I see a sweetness
in her smile.

53:52.380 --> 53:54.840
"Bright light shines
from her eyes.

53:56.710 --> 53:59.840
"But life is complete,
contentment is mine...

53:59.930 --> 54:04.430
"just knowing that...

54:04.510 --> 54:07.640
"Just knowing that...

54:07.730 --> 54:09.690
she's alive."

54:09.770 --> 54:12.730
- I'm sorry, Captain. It's stupid.
- No. No, it's not stupid.

54:12.770 --> 54:16.610
It's a good effort. It touched on
one of the major themes: love.

54:16.690 --> 54:19.740
A major theme
not only in poetry but life.

54:19.820 --> 54:24.620
Mr. Hopkins, you were laughing.
You're up.

54:33.750 --> 54:37.590
"The cat sat on the mat."

54:43.340 --> 54:44.930
Congratulations, Mr. Hopkins.

54:45.010 --> 54:47.640
Yours is the first poem to ever have
a negative score on the Pritchard scale.

54:47.720 --> 54:51.230
We're not laughing at you,
we're laughing near you.

54:51.310 --> 54:53.900
I don't mind that your poem
had a simple theme.

54:53.980 --> 54:56.230
Sometimes the most beautiful poetry
can be about simple things,

54:56.320 --> 54:59.400
like a cat or a flower or rain.

54:59.440 --> 55:02.700
You see, poetry can come from anything
with the stuff of revelation in it.

55:02.780 --> 55:04.910
Just don't let your poems
be ordinary.

55:07.030 --> 55:09.750
Now, who's next?

55:10.960 --> 55:14.790
Mr. Anderson, I see you
sitting there in agony.

55:14.830 --> 55:17.920
Come on, Todd, step up.
Let's put you out of your misery.

55:20.760 --> 55:22.840
I-I didn't do it.
I didn't write a poem.

55:26.720 --> 55:31.600
Mr. Anderson thinks everything inside
of him is worthless and embarrassing.

55:31.640 --> 55:36.270
Isn't that right, Todd?
Isn't that your worst fear?

55:36.310 --> 55:38.940
Well, I think you're wrong. I think
you have something inside of you...

55:38.980 --> 55:42.030
that is worth a great deal.

55:42.110 --> 55:45.660
"I sound...

55:45.740 --> 55:51.040
"my barbaric...

55:52.120 --> 55:54.040
"yawp...

55:56.830 --> 55:59.090
"over the rooftops...

55:59.170 --> 56:01.630
of the world."

56:03.930 --> 56:07.640
W.W.
Uncle Walt, again.

56:07.720 --> 56:12.270
Now, for those of you who don't know,
a yawp is a loud cry or yell.

56:12.350 --> 56:16.650
Now, Todd, I would like you to give us
a demonstration of a barbaric yawp.

56:16.690 --> 56:20.020
Come on, you can't yawp sitting down.

56:20.070 --> 56:22.320
Let's go.
Come on, up.

56:22.360 --> 56:26.410
Got to get in yawping stance.

56:26.490 --> 56:30.200
- A-A yawp?
- Not just a yawp. A barbaric yawp.

56:30.280 --> 56:34.790
- Right. Yawp.
- Come on. Louder.

56:34.870 --> 56:36.920
- Yawp.
- That's a mouse. Come on, louder!

56:37.000 --> 56:38.920
- Yawp.
- Oh, good God, boy, yell like a man!

56:39.000 --> 56:40.420
- Yawp!
- There it is.

56:40.500 --> 56:43.010
You see, you have a barbarian
in you after all.

56:43.050 --> 56:45.550
You don't get away that easy. There's
a picture of Uncle Walt up there.

56:45.630 --> 56:49.550
What does he remind you of?
Don't think, answer. Go on.

56:49.640 --> 56:51.850
- A m-m-m-madman.
- What kind of madman?

56:51.930 --> 56:53.890
- Don't think about it, just answer.
- A cr-crazy madman.

56:53.930 --> 56:56.770
No, you can do better than that.
Free up your mind. Use your imagination.

56:56.850 --> 56:59.360
Say the first thing that pops into
your head, even if it's total gibberish.

56:59.440 --> 57:01.520
A-A-A sweaty-toothed madman.

57:01.610 --> 57:04.280
Good God, boy, there's
a poet in you after all!

57:04.360 --> 57:07.160
There. Close your eyes.
Close your eyes. Close them.

57:07.240 --> 57:09.320
Now, describe what you see.

57:09.410 --> 57:12.120
- Uh, I-I close my eyes...
- Yes?

57:12.200 --> 57:15.870
- uh, and his image floats beside me.
- A sweaty-toothed madman.

57:15.910 --> 57:18.670
A sweaty-toothed madman with
a stare that pounds my brain.

57:18.750 --> 57:20.170
Oh, that's excellent!

57:20.250 --> 57:22.170
Now, give him action,
make him do something.

57:22.250 --> 57:24.710
- H-His hands reach out and choke me.
- That's it. Wonderful. Wonderful.

57:24.760 --> 57:26.720
- And all the time he's mumbling.
- What's he mumbling?

57:26.760 --> 57:28.720
- Mumbling truth.
- Yes.

57:28.760 --> 57:32.220
Truth is like a blanket that
always leaves your feet cold.

57:32.260 --> 57:35.270
Forget them. Forget them. Stay with
the blanket. Tell me about that blanket.

57:35.350 --> 57:38.770
Y-Y-You push it, stretch it,
it'll never be enough.

57:38.810 --> 57:40.900
You kick at it, beat it,
it'll never cover any of us.

57:40.980 --> 57:44.360
From the moment we enter crying
to the moment we leave dying,

57:44.440 --> 57:49.360
it'll just cover your face
as you wail and cry and scream.

57:57.870 --> 58:00.750
Don't you forget this.

59:01.980 --> 59:04.360
That a boy, Pittsie.

59:04.400 --> 59:06.650
- Inhale, deeply.
- My dad collects pipes.

59:06.730 --> 59:08.990
- Really?
- He must have 30.

59:09.070 --> 59:11.780
Your parents collect pipes?
Oh, that's interesting.

59:11.860 --> 59:16.030
- Come on, Knox. Join in.
- Yeah, Knox, we're from the government.

59:16.120 --> 59:18.040
We're here to help.
What's wrong?

59:18.120 --> 59:21.410
- It's Chris!
- Here's a picture of Chris for you!

59:21.500 --> 59:23.420
- Put that in your pipe and smoke it.
- It's not funny.

59:23.500 --> 59:26.920
Knock it off.
Smoke your pipes.

59:27.000 --> 59:31.720
- Neil.
- Friends, scholars, Welton men.

59:31.800 --> 59:34.010
What is that, Neil?

59:34.050 --> 59:39.220
- Duh, it's a lamp, Meeks.
- No, this is the god of the cave.

59:39.310 --> 59:40.730
The god of the cave.

59:42.980 --> 59:46.190
- Charlie, what are you doing?
- What do you say we start this meeting?

59:46.270 --> 59:49.440
- I need a light. Who's got a light?
- Anybody bring earplugs?

59:49.530 --> 59:52.820
Gentlemen.

59:52.900 --> 59:57.530
"Poetrusic" by Charles Dalton.

59:57.580 --> 01:00:01.250
Oh, man.

01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:04.000
Laughing, crying,
tumbling, mumbling.

01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.130
Gotta do more,
gotta be more.

01:00:08.290 --> 01:00:11.130
Pitts.

01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:14.970
Chaos screaming, chaos dreaming.
Gotta do more, gotta be more!

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:50.420
- Wow. Nice.
- That was great.

01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.420
Where did you learn
to play like that?

01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:55.130
My parents made me take
the clarinet for years!

01:00:55.220 --> 01:00:57.640
- I love the clarinet.
- I hated it.

01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:04.810
The saxophone.
The saxophone is more... sonorous.

01:01:04.890 --> 01:01:07.520
Ooh, more sonorous.
Vocabulary.

01:01:07.600 --> 01:01:11.190
I can't take it anymore.
If I don't have Chris,

01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:14.440
- I'm gonna kill myself.
- Knoxious, calm down.

01:01:14.530 --> 01:01:18.570
No, Charlie!
That's just my problem.

01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:22.290
I've been calm all my life.
I'm gonna do something about that.

01:01:22.370 --> 01:01:24.950
Where are you going?
What are you gonna do?

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.210
I'm gonna call her.

01:01:27.290 --> 01:01:31.380
- He's gonna call her!
- Wait for me!

01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.380
Hello?

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:38.220
She's gonna hate me.

01:01:40.390 --> 01:01:42.260
The Danburrys will hate me.

01:01:42.350 --> 01:01:45.560
My parents will kill me.

01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:52.070
All right, goddamn it.

01:01:52.150 --> 01:01:55.780
You're right.
Carpe diem.

01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:58.200
Even if it kills me.

01:02:06.290 --> 01:02:08.210
- Hello?
- Hello, Chris?

01:02:08.290 --> 01:02:11.210
- Yes.
- Hi. This is Knox Overstreet.

01:02:11.290 --> 01:02:14.880
Oh, yes. Knox.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:17.880
- I'm glad you called.
- She's glad I called.

01:02:17.970 --> 01:02:20.090
Listen, Chet's parents
are going out of town this weekend,

01:02:20.180 --> 01:02:22.100
and he's having a party.

01:02:22.180 --> 01:02:24.220
- Would you like to come?
- Would I like to come to a party?

01:02:24.310 --> 01:02:27.230
- Yes. Say yes.
- It's Friday.
- Well, sure.

01:02:27.270 --> 01:02:29.140
- About 7:00.
- Great. I'll be there, Chris.

01:02:29.230 --> 01:02:32.060
- Okay.
- Friday night at the Danburrys'. Okay.

01:02:32.150 --> 01:02:34.400
- Okay. Bye.
- Thank you. I'll see you. Bye.

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.820
Yawp!

01:02:38.990 --> 01:02:40.910
Can you believe it?

01:02:40.990 --> 01:02:43.700
She was gonna call me.

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:46.240
She invited me
to a party with her.

01:02:46.290 --> 01:02:49.040
- At Chet Danburry's house.
- Yeah.

01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.710
- Well?
- So?

01:02:51.750 --> 01:02:56.380
So you don't really think
she means you're going with her?

01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:59.880
Well, of course not, Charlie.
But that's not the point.

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:04.220
- That's not the point at all.
- What is the point?

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:09.560
- The point, Charlie...
- Uh-huh?

01:03:09.600 --> 01:03:13.400
- is...
- Yeah?

01:03:13.440 --> 01:03:17.110
that she was
thinking about me.

01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:19.940
I've only met her once,
and already...

01:03:20.030 --> 01:03:22.070
she's thinking about me.

01:03:22.110 --> 01:03:24.740
Damn it, it's gonna happen, guys.

01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:27.030
I feel it.

01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:30.250
She is going to be mine.

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:37.710
Carpe! Carpe!

01:03:37.800 --> 01:03:41.970
No grades at stake, gentlemen.
Just take a stroll.

01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:53.600
There it is.

01:04:00.190 --> 01:04:03.740
- I don't know, but I've been told.
- I don't know, but I've been told.

01:04:03.820 --> 01:04:06.490
Doing poetry is cold.

01:04:06.570 --> 01:04:10.660
- Doing poetry is cold.
- Left. Left. Left, right, left.

01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:14.040
Left. Left.
Left, right, left.

01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.040
Left. Halt!

01:04:16.130 --> 01:04:19.710
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:23.800
If you noticed, everyone started off
with their own stride, their own pace.

01:04:23.840 --> 01:04:27.850
Mr. Pitts taking his time.
He knew he'll get there one day.

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:30.640
Mr. Cameron. You could see him thinking,
"Is this right? It might be right.

01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:33.600
It might be right. I know that...
Maybe not. I don't know."

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:39.020
Mr. Overstreet,
driven by a deeper force. Yes.

01:04:39.070 --> 01:04:42.110
We know that. All right. Now, I didn't
bring them up here to ridicule them.

01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:44.900
I brought them up here to
illustrate the point of conformity.

01:04:44.990 --> 01:04:48.620
The difficulty in maintaining your
own beliefs in the face of others.

01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:53.080
Now, I see the look in your eyes like,
"I would have walked differently."

01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:55.920
Well, ask yourselves
why you were clapping.

01:04:56.000 --> 01:04:59.040
Now we all have a great need
for acceptance.

01:04:59.130 --> 01:05:02.210
But you must trust that
your beliefs are unique, your own.

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.720
Even though others may think
them odd or unpopular.

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.430
Even though the herd may go,
"That's ba-a-a-a-ad."

01:05:07.510 --> 01:05:10.010
Robert Frost said,

01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:15.600
"Two roads diverged in the wood and I,
I took the one less traveled by.

01:05:15.690 --> 01:05:17.600
And that has made
all the difference."

01:05:17.690 --> 01:05:20.060
I want you to find
your own walk right now,

01:05:20.110 --> 01:05:23.030
your own way of striding,
pacing any direction.

01:05:23.070 --> 01:05:26.610
Anything you want, whether it's proud,
whether it's silly, anything.

01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:31.200
Gentlemen, the courtyard is yours.

01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:36.000
You don't have to perform,
just make it for yourself.

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:40.420
Mr. Dalton,
will you be joining us?

01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:42.750
Exercising the right
not to walk.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:47.130
Thank you, Mr. Dalton.
Just illustrated the point.

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:51.100
Swim against the stream.

01:06:00.610 --> 01:06:02.570
Todd?

01:06:04.530 --> 01:06:06.440
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:09.450
- What's going on?
- Nothing.

01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:14.700
- Today's my birthday.
- Is today your birthday?

01:06:14.790 --> 01:06:16.500
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:20.670
- What did you get?
- My parents just gave me this.

01:06:20.750 --> 01:06:21.920
Isn't this the same desk set...

01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:24.960
Yeah, yeah, they gave me
the same thing as last year.

01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:29.470
- Oh.
- Oh.

01:06:31.140 --> 01:06:33.050
Maybe they thought you needed
another one.

01:06:33.140 --> 01:06:36.600
Maybe they weren't
thinking about anything at all.

01:06:39.140 --> 01:06:44.150
The funny thing is, about this,
is I didn't even like it the first time.

01:06:46.610 --> 01:06:50.280
Todd, I think you're underestimating
the value of this desk set.

01:06:52.370 --> 01:06:57.580
I mean, who would want
a football or a baseball...

01:06:57.660 --> 01:06:59.620
- Or a car.
- Mm-hmm, or a car...

01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:02.380
if they could have a desk set
as wonderful as this one.

01:07:02.460 --> 01:07:06.590
I mean, if I were ever going
to buy a desk set... twice,

01:07:06.670 --> 01:07:10.300
I would probably
buy this one... both times.

01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:16.810
In fact, its... shape is...

01:07:16.850 --> 01:07:19.680
It's rather aerodynamic,
isn't it?

01:07:19.770 --> 01:07:23.100
You can feel it.

01:07:23.190 --> 01:07:28.280
This desk set wants to fly.

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:32.950
Todd...

01:07:33.030 --> 01:07:37.160
the world's first
unmanned flying desk set.

01:07:42.210 --> 01:07:46.790
Oh, my!
Well, I wouldn't worry.

01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:50.210
You'll get another one next year.

01:07:50.260 --> 01:07:53.300
"To live deep and suck out
all the marrow of life.

01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:57.220
To put to rout all that was not life..."

01:07:57.260 --> 01:07:59.810
My God.

01:07:59.890 --> 01:08:03.770
- Is this it?
- Yeah, this is it.

01:08:03.850 --> 01:08:07.520
Go ahead. Go on in.
It's my cave. Watch your step.

01:08:07.610 --> 01:08:09.070
Uh-oh.

01:08:09.110 --> 01:08:11.690
Hi.

01:08:11.780 --> 01:08:13.320
- Hello.
- Hi.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:18.370
Hi, guys. Meet, uh, Gloria and...

01:08:18.410 --> 01:08:20.410
- Tina.
- Tina.

01:08:20.450 --> 01:08:24.250
- This is the pledge class
of the Dead Poets Society.
- Hello.

01:08:24.330 --> 01:08:26.420
- How do you do?
- Hello. - Hi.

01:08:26.500 --> 01:08:30.300
Guys, move. Move!
Come on, folks, it's Friday night.

01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:34.680
Let's get on with the meeting.
Guys, I have an announcement to make.

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.510
In keeping with the spirit of passionate
experimentation of the Dead Poets,

01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:40.810
I'm giving up the name
Charles Dalton.

01:08:40.890 --> 01:08:43.479
From now on,
call me Nuwanda.

01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:46.060
Nuwanda?

01:08:58.450 --> 01:09:00.029
Hello? Hello, Chris?

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:03.410
I crashed in the jungle
while trying to keep a date

01:09:03.450 --> 01:09:06.580
With my little girl
who was back in the States

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:08.580
- I was stranded in the jungle...
- Knox!

01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:10.750
- Hi.
- You made it! Great.

01:09:10.800 --> 01:09:12.760
- Did you bring anybody?
- No.

01:09:12.800 --> 01:09:16.590
No? Ginny Danburry's here.
Look, I have to go find Chet.

01:09:16.630 --> 01:09:19.430
- Why don't you go downstairs?
That's where everybody is.
- Yeah, but Chris, I've...

01:09:19.470 --> 01:09:22.600
- Make yourself at home.
- But I've...

01:09:25.810 --> 01:09:30.060
Baby, baby
let's make romance

01:09:31.819 --> 01:09:35.950
You know your old-time lover
hasn't got a chance

01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:39.779
Hi, guys.

01:09:43.410 --> 01:09:46.500
Hey, you Mutt Sanders'
brother?

01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:49.960
Bubba, this guy look like
Mutt Sanders to you, or what?

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.840
- You're his brother?
- No relation.

01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:56.550
- Never heard of him. Sorry, guys.
- Where's our manners, Steve?

01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:58.760
Here's Mutt Sanders' brother
and we don't even offer him a drink.

01:09:58.840 --> 01:10:01.600
- Here you go. Have some whiskey, pal.
- Yeah.

01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:03.890
I, uh, I don't really drink whiskey.

01:10:03.970 --> 01:10:07.190
- To Mutt.
- To Mutt.

01:10:07.270 --> 01:10:09.350
To Mutt.

01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:16.030
- How the hell is old Mutt anyway?
- Yeah, what's old Mutter been up to?

01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:18.320
I don't really know Mutt.

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.950
To the Mighty Mutt.

01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:24.290
- To Mighty Mutt.
- To Mighty Mutt.

01:10:27.620 --> 01:10:32.090
Listen, I gotta go find Patsy.

01:10:32.170 --> 01:10:36.130
- Say hello to Mutt for me, okay?
- Will do.

01:10:36.210 --> 01:10:40.380
Hell of a guy, your brother Mutt.

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:43.010
We gonna have a meeting,
or what?

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:45.060
Yeah, if you guys
don't have a meeting,

01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:47.060
how do we know
if we want to join?

01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:50.140
"Join"?

01:10:50.230 --> 01:10:52.940
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

01:10:53.020 --> 01:10:55.440
Thou art more lovely
and more temperate."

01:10:55.530 --> 01:10:57.190
That's so sweet.

01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:02.070
- I made that up just for you.
- You did?

01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:05.160
I'll write one
for you too, Gloria.

01:11:07.580 --> 01:11:10.830
"She walks in beauty
like the night.

01:11:12.290 --> 01:11:15.340
"She walks in beauty
like the night...

01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:20.590
"of cloudless climes
and starry skies.

01:11:20.680 --> 01:11:22.590
"All that's best,
dark and bright,

01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:26.890
- meet in her aspect and her eyes."
- That's beautiful.

01:11:28.350 --> 01:11:30.890
There's plenty more
where that came from.

01:11:46.530 --> 01:11:51.000
She sure looks fine to me
What's her name

01:11:51.080 --> 01:11:53.620
Look out
Let me call her one time

01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:08.060
Hey, little girl

01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:12.020
Gee, you sure look fine

01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:16.270
God, help me.

01:12:16.310 --> 01:12:20.440
Ooh, baby
you're not mine

01:12:23.450 --> 01:12:28.620
Hey, little girl
How's about a date

01:12:30.410 --> 01:12:33.660
- Carpe diem.
- Hey, little girl

01:12:33.750 --> 01:12:37.670
How's about a date

01:12:39.170 --> 01:12:42.300
You know I'll come get you
early, baby

01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:45.220
Won't keep you out
too late

01:12:48.470 --> 01:12:50.970
Say, little girl

01:12:51.020 --> 01:12:53.430
Now how's about a kiss

01:12:56.270 --> 01:12:59.320
Yeah, say, little girl

01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:03.070
How's about a kiss

01:13:03.150 --> 01:13:07.070
- You don't remember?
- Well, if you don't kiss me, baby

01:13:07.160 --> 01:13:11.910
- Chet. Chet. Look.
- What?

01:13:11.990 --> 01:13:15.040
- It's Mutt Sanders' brother.
- Huh?

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:16.830
- Knox, what...
- And he's feeling up your girl!

01:13:16.920 --> 01:13:19.170
What are you doing?

01:13:19.250 --> 01:13:21.800
- What the hell are you doing?
- Chet. Chet, don't!

01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:25.010
- Now, Chet, I know this looks bad...
- Leave him alone.

01:13:25.090 --> 01:13:27.340
Chet, no!
You'll hurt him!

01:13:27.430 --> 01:13:30.760
- Chet, stop it! Leave him alone!
- Damn!

01:13:30.850 --> 01:13:32.930
- Chet, stop it!
- Bastard!

01:13:33.020 --> 01:13:35.060
Knox, are you all right?

01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:37.020
Chris, get the hell away from him!

01:13:37.060 --> 01:13:38.350
- Chet, you hurt him!
- Good!

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:41.820
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay. It's-It's okay.

01:13:41.900 --> 01:13:43.820
Next time I see you,
you die.

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:49.870
Go ahead.
Pass it around.

01:13:58.250 --> 01:14:01.790
Me and Pitts are working
on a hi-fi system.

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:05.670
It shouldn't be that hard to,
uh, to put together.

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:09.090
Yeah. Uh, I might
be going to Yale.

01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:12.100
Uh, but I-I might not.

01:14:12.180 --> 01:14:14.270
Don't you guys miss
having girls around here?

01:14:14.350 --> 01:14:15.930
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:14:16.020 --> 01:14:18.560
That's part of what this club is about.

01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.810
In fact,
I'd like to announce...

01:14:20.900 --> 01:14:24.190
I published an article in the school
paper in the name of the Dead Poets,

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.700
- What?
- demanding girls
be admitted to Welton...

01:14:27.780 --> 01:14:30.410
- You didn't.
- so we can all stop beating off.

01:14:30.490 --> 01:14:32.200
- How did you do that?
- I'm one of the proofers.

01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:35.290
- I slipped the article in.
- It's-It's over now.

01:14:35.370 --> 01:14:36.910
Why?
Nobody knows who we are.

01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.250
Well, don't you think
they're gonna figure out who wrote it?

01:14:39.330 --> 01:14:43.000
They're gonna come to you and ask
to know what the Dead Poets Society is.

01:14:43.090 --> 01:14:45.590
Charlie, you had no right
to do something like that.

01:14:45.670 --> 01:14:47.970
It's Nuwanda, Cameron.

01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:50.890
That's right. It's Nuwanda.

01:14:50.970 --> 01:14:54.060
Are we just playing around out here,
or do we mean what we say?

01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:56.970
If all we do is come together
and read a bunch of poems to each other,

01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:58.980
- what the hell are we doing?
- All right.

01:14:59.020 --> 01:15:01.100
But you still shouldn't
have done it, Charlie.

01:15:01.150 --> 01:15:03.650
This could mean trouble.
You don't speak for the club.

01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:06.320
Hey, would you not worry about
your precious little neck?

01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.740
If they catch me,
I'll tell them I made it up.

01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.250
Fine.

01:15:36.350 --> 01:15:38.270
Sit.

01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:45.400
In this week's issue
of Welton Honor,

01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:49.320
there appeared a profane
and unauthorized article.

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:54.990
Rather than spend my valuable time
ferreting out the guilty persons...

01:15:55.030 --> 01:15:57.330
And let me assure you
I will find them...

01:15:57.370 --> 01:16:00.870
I'm asking any and all students
who know anything about this article...

01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:04.790
to make themselves known
here and now.

01:16:06.630 --> 01:16:09.090
Whoever the guilty persons are,

01:16:09.170 --> 01:16:13.340
this is your only chance to avoid
expulsion from this school.

01:16:18.470 --> 01:16:20.520
Welton Academy.
Hello.

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:23.140
Yes, he is.
Just a moment.

01:16:23.230 --> 01:16:26.270
Mr. Nolan, it's for you.

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:28.320
It's God!

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.360
He says we should have girls
at Welton.

01:16:46.130 --> 01:16:48.290
Wipe that smirk off your face.

01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:51.380
If you think, Mr. Dalton,

01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:54.430
that you're the first to try to get
thrown out of this school, think again.

01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:58.550
Others have had similar notions and have
failed just as surely as you will fail.

01:16:58.640 --> 01:17:02.060
Assume the position.

01:17:13.320 --> 01:17:15.780
Count aloud, Mr. Dalton.

01:17:19.160 --> 01:17:21.200
One.

01:17:23.330 --> 01:17:25.420
Two.

01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:32.170
Three.

01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:35.840
Four.

01:17:35.930 --> 01:17:38.300
Five.

01:17:38.340 --> 01:17:41.100
What is this Dead Poets Society?
I want names.

01:18:10.330 --> 01:18:12.590
- You kicked out?
- No.

01:18:12.670 --> 01:18:15.420
So what happened?

01:18:17.510 --> 01:18:21.100
I'm to turn everybody in,
apologize to the school,

01:18:21.180 --> 01:18:23.260
and all will be forgiven.

01:18:23.350 --> 01:18:25.560
So what are you gonna do?

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:28.940
- Charlie...
- Damn it, Neil,

01:18:29.020 --> 01:18:31.980
the name is Nuwanda.

01:18:37.530 --> 01:18:40.950
Excuse me.
May we have a word, Mr. Keating?

01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:43.030
Certainly.

01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:52.540
This was my first classroom, John.
Did you know that?

01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:54.880
My first desk.

01:18:54.960 --> 01:18:57.380
I didn't know you taught,
Mr. Nolan.

01:18:57.470 --> 01:19:01.890
English.
Long before your time.

01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:05.390
It was hard giving it up,
I can tell you.

01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:13.730
I'm hearing rumors about some unorthodox
teaching methods in your classroom.

01:19:13.820 --> 01:19:18.070
I'm not saying they've had anything
to do with the Dalton boy's outburst,

01:19:18.150 --> 01:19:22.910
but I don't think I have to warn you
boys his age are very impressionable.

01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:26.240
Well, your reprimand made
quite an impression, I'm sure.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:33.080
- What was going on
in the courtyard the other day?
- Courtyard?

01:19:33.170 --> 01:19:36.250
- Boys marching, clapping in unison.
- Oh, that.

01:19:36.340 --> 01:19:39.470
That was an exercise to prove a point:
dangers of conformity.

01:19:39.550 --> 01:19:42.390
Well, John, the curriculum here is set.
It's proven. It works.

01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:45.050
If you question it, what's to
prevent them from doing the same?

01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:47.560
I always thought the idea of education
was to learn to think for yourself.

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:50.270
At these boys' age?
Not on your life!

01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:54.400
Tradition, John. Discipline.

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:58.900
Prepare them for college,
and the rest will take care of itself.

01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:06.240
Creak.

01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:09.250
He starts walking around
towards my left.

01:20:09.290 --> 01:20:12.670
Creak. Creak.

01:20:12.750 --> 01:20:16.380
"Assume the position, Mr. Dalton,"
which means...

01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:18.590
All right, gentlemen.

01:20:18.630 --> 01:20:21.760
- Mr. Keating.
- Mr. Dalton.

01:20:21.800 --> 01:20:24.090
That was a pretty lame stunt
you pulled today.

01:20:24.140 --> 01:20:26.100
You're siding with Mr. Nolan?

01:20:26.140 --> 01:20:28.100
What about carpe diem
and sucking all the marrow...

01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:29.930
- out of life and all that?
- Sucking the marrow out of life...

01:20:29.970 --> 01:20:33.020
doesn't mean
choking on the bone.

01:20:33.100 --> 01:20:37.440
There is a time for daring,
and there is a time for caution.

01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:39.940
And a wise man understands
which is called for.

01:20:39.980 --> 01:20:42.240
But I thought you'd like that.

01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:44.240
No.

01:20:44.320 --> 01:20:47.280
You being expelled from school
is not daring to me. It's stupid.

01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:49.830
'Cause you'll miss some
golden opportunities.

01:20:49.910 --> 01:20:51.370
Yeah? Like what?

01:20:51.450 --> 01:20:55.500
Like, if nothing else,
the opportunity to attend my classes.

01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:59.800
Got it, ace?

01:20:59.840 --> 01:21:02.630
Aye, aye, Captain.

01:21:02.670 --> 01:21:05.180
Keep your head about you.

01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:08.050
That goes for the lot of you.

01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:11.060
- Yes, Captain.
- Yes, Captain.

01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:13.140
Phone call from God.

01:21:15.100 --> 01:21:18.480
If it'd been collect,
it would have been daring.

01:21:20.650 --> 01:21:24.030
- All right. Go on, boy.
- No.

01:21:33.870 --> 01:21:36.580
We're trying to rehearse, okay? Go.

01:21:36.670 --> 01:21:38.750
A good persuasion,
therefore hear me, Hermia.

01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:42.710
Wait, wait. The excitement. I don't
hear any excitement about this play.

01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:47.220
Now take her hand,
bring her downstage...

01:21:47.260 --> 01:21:49.300
and stop
and "Fair, gentle Hermia."

01:21:49.390 --> 01:21:51.510
Okay? Try again.

01:21:51.560 --> 01:21:53.520
What's for dinner?

01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:55.350
- Spaghetti and meatballs!
- Food!

01:21:57.940 --> 01:22:00.020
Save some for me.

01:22:01.770 --> 01:22:05.150
"But, room, fairy!
Here comes Oberon."

01:22:07.660 --> 01:22:11.410
- Father.
- Neil.

01:22:11.490 --> 01:22:13.660
Wait a minute.
Before you say anything,

01:22:13.750 --> 01:22:16.870
- please let me ex...
- Don't you dare talk back to me.

01:22:18.580 --> 01:22:21.710
It's bad enough that
you've wasted your time...

01:22:21.790 --> 01:22:25.300
with this, this
absurd acting business,

01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:28.590
but you deliberately
deceived me.

01:22:28.680 --> 01:22:32.220
How-How-How did you expect
to get away with this?

01:22:34.310 --> 01:22:36.390
Answer me.

01:22:36.480 --> 01:22:38.560
Who put you up to it?

01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:41.900
- Was it this new man? Keating?
- No.

01:22:41.940 --> 01:22:45.990
Nobody p... I thought I'd surprise you.
I've gotten all A's in every class.

01:22:46.070 --> 01:22:49.320
Did you really think
I wasn't going to find out?

01:22:49.410 --> 01:22:53.370
"Oh, my niece is in a play
with your son," says Mrs. Marks.

01:22:53.450 --> 01:22:57.290
"No, no, no," I say. "You must be
mistaken. My son's not in a play."

01:22:57.370 --> 01:22:59.290
You made a liar out of me, Neil!

01:23:03.380 --> 01:23:07.840
Now, tomorrow, you go to them
and you tell them that you're quitting.

01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:09.840
No, I can't.

01:23:09.930 --> 01:23:12.050
I have the main part.
The performance is tomorrow night!

01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:14.140
I don't care if the world
comes to an end tomorrow night,

01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:17.390
you are through with that play!

01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:19.390
Is that clear?

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:22.020
Is that clear?

01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:25.610
Yes, sir.

01:23:32.820 --> 01:23:36.540
I made a great many sacrifices
to get you here, Neil,

01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:40.790
and you will not let me down.

01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:43.330
No, sir.

01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:06.110
It's open.

01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:19.040
Neil, what's up?

01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.790
- Can I speak to you a minute?
- Certainly. Sit down.

01:24:22.580 --> 01:24:24.830
Oh.

01:24:24.920 --> 01:24:27.460
- I'm sorry. Here.
- Excuse me.

01:24:29.670 --> 01:24:34.180
- Get you some tea?
- Tea? Sure.

01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:37.640
- Want some milk or sugar in that?
- No, thanks.

01:24:37.720 --> 01:24:39.850
Gosh, they don't give you
much room around here.

01:24:39.930 --> 01:24:41.810
It's part of the monastic oath.

01:24:41.890 --> 01:24:45.400
They don't want worldly things
distracting me from my teaching.

01:24:48.270 --> 01:24:50.230
- She's pretty.
- She's also in London.

01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:53.400
Makes it a little difficult.

01:24:53.490 --> 01:24:56.490
- How do you stand it?
- Stand what?

01:24:56.570 --> 01:24:58.910
You can go anywhere. You can do
anything. How can you stand being here?

01:24:58.990 --> 01:25:02.910
Because I love teaching.
I don't want to be anywhere else.

01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:10.460
- What's up?
- I just talked to my father.

01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:13.170
He's making me quit the play
at Henley Hall.

01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:18.220
But acting is everything to me.

01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:21.390
I mean...
But he doesn't know. He...

01:25:21.470 --> 01:25:26.520
I can see his point. We're not
a rich family like Charlie's. I mean...

01:25:26.600 --> 01:25:29.690
But he's planning the rest
of my life for me.

01:25:29.770 --> 01:25:32.190
And he-he's never asked me
what I want.

01:25:32.280 --> 01:25:35.150
Have you ever told your father
what you just told me?

01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:37.910
About your passion for acting?
Have you showed him that?

01:25:37.990 --> 01:25:41.120
- I can't.
- Why not?

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.120
I can't talk to him this way.

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:45.870
Then you're acting for him too.

01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:49.170
You're playing the part
of the dutiful son.

01:25:49.250 --> 01:25:51.170
I know this sounds impossible,
but you have to talk to him.

01:25:51.250 --> 01:25:53.970
You have to show him
who you are, what your heart is.

01:25:54.050 --> 01:25:56.550
I know what he'll say.

01:25:56.630 --> 01:25:59.140
He'll tell me that acting's a whim
and I should forget it.

01:25:59.220 --> 01:26:01.720
They're counting on me.

01:26:01.810 --> 01:26:05.140
He'll just tell me to put it
out of my mind for my own good.

01:26:05.230 --> 01:26:07.060
You are not
an indentured servant.

01:26:07.150 --> 01:26:11.860
It's not a whim for you. You prove it to
him by your conviction and your passion.

01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:14.360
You show him that,
and if he still doesn't believe you...

01:26:14.440 --> 01:26:17.450
Well, by then, you'll be out of school,
and you can do anything you want.

01:26:19.660 --> 01:26:23.790
No.

01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:26.040
What about the play?
The show's tomorrow night.

01:26:26.120 --> 01:26:29.250
Then you have to talk
to him before tomorrow night.

01:26:31.710 --> 01:26:33.710
I...

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.970
- Isn't there an easier way?
- No.

01:26:40.140 --> 01:26:43.970
I'm trapped.

01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:46.560
No, you're not.

01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:11.540
Chris!

01:27:13.290 --> 01:27:15.960
Chris! Chris Noel.
Do you know where she is?

01:27:16.050 --> 01:27:18.590
- Um, I think she's in Room 111.
- Thanks.

01:27:21.890 --> 01:27:23.850
I know.

01:27:29.810 --> 01:27:31.770
Excuse me. Chris...

01:27:31.850 --> 01:27:33.730
Knox, what are you doing here?

01:27:33.820 --> 01:27:35.730
I came to apologize for the other night.

01:27:35.820 --> 01:27:37.860
I brought you these
and a poem I wrote for you.

01:27:41.490 --> 01:27:44.120
Knox, don't you know that
if Chet finds you here, he'll kill you?

01:27:44.200 --> 01:27:48.040
- I don't care. I love you, Chris.
- Knox, you're crazy.

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:50.790
Look, I acted like a jerk,
and I know it.

01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:54.540
- Please accept these. Please.
- No. No, I... I can't.

01:27:54.630 --> 01:27:56.800
Just forget it.

01:28:12.230 --> 01:28:15.310
- Knox, I don't believe this.
- All I'm asking you to do is listen.

01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:21.360
"The heavens made a girl named Chris...

01:28:21.450 --> 01:28:23.360
"with hair and skin of gold.

01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:25.410
"To touch her...

01:28:25.450 --> 01:28:28.750
would be paradise."

01:28:45.640 --> 01:28:48.140
Get out of here. Cameron, you fool.

01:28:48.180 --> 01:28:51.270
Hey, how'd it go?
Did you read it to her?

01:28:51.350 --> 01:28:55.610
- Yeah.
- Wow. What'd she say?

01:28:55.690 --> 01:28:58.820
- Nothing.
- What do you mean, nothing?

01:28:58.900 --> 01:29:02.280
Nothing. But I did it.

01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:06.030
Well, what did she say?
She had to say something!

01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:09.240
- Hey, Knox!
- Seize the day!

01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:21.460
- Did you talk to your father?
- Uh, yeah.

01:29:21.550 --> 01:29:25.220
He didn't like it one bit, but at least
he's letting me stay in the play.

01:29:25.300 --> 01:29:29.560
He won't be able to m-make it.
He's in Chicago.

01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:32.600
But, uh, I think he's gonna
let me stay with acting.

01:29:32.680 --> 01:29:36.980
Really? You told him
what you told me?

01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:39.820
Yeah.

01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:41.860
He wasn't happy.

01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:46.160
But he'll be gone
at least four days.

01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:50.660
I don't think he'll make
the show, but...

01:29:50.740 --> 01:29:52.950
I think he'll let me
stay with it.

01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:54.960
"Keep up the schoolwork."

01:29:58.210 --> 01:30:03.380
Thanks.

01:30:04.550 --> 01:30:07.550
- Oh, baby.
- Beautiful baby.

01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:09.550
- I am...
- Excuse me.

01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:13.180
Just a moment. Yes. You're so good.

01:30:13.270 --> 01:30:15.230
Come on, Todd.
I'm trying to fix this.

01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:17.600
Come on, Nuwanda,
we're going to miss Neil's entrance.

01:30:17.690 --> 01:30:20.360
He said something about
getting red before we left.

01:30:20.440 --> 01:30:23.690
- "Getting red"? What does that mean?
- I... You know Charlie.

01:30:27.160 --> 01:30:30.240
So, Charlie,
what's this "getting red" bit?

01:30:31.990 --> 01:30:34.500
- Ooh. - Ooh.

01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:36.750
W-What is that?

01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:40.460
It's an Indian warrior
symbol for virility.

01:30:40.540 --> 01:30:44.170
Makes me feel potent,
like I can drive girls crazy.

01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:46.670
Oh, come on, Charlie.
The girls are waiting.

01:30:49.180 --> 01:30:51.180
Whoa.

01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:58.520
Chris.

01:31:00.100 --> 01:31:01.520
What are you doing here?

01:31:01.610 --> 01:31:04.940
- Gentlemen, let's go!
- Go ahead, guys. I'll catch up.

01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:07.490
Yeah. Come on, guys.

01:31:07.570 --> 01:31:09.490
Chris, you can't be in here.

01:31:09.570 --> 01:31:11.530
- If they catch you, we're both
gonna be in big trouble.
- Come on.

01:31:11.620 --> 01:31:14.160
- Oh, but it's fine if...
- Shh, shh. Chris.

01:31:16.370 --> 01:31:20.170
It's fine for you to come barging into
my school and make a fool out of me?

01:31:20.250 --> 01:31:22.170
I didn't mean
to make a fool out of you.

01:31:22.250 --> 01:31:24.630
Well, you did.
Chet found out.

01:31:24.710 --> 01:31:28.880
It took everything I could do to keep
him from coming here and killing you.

01:31:28.970 --> 01:31:33.550
- Knox, you have got to stop this stuff.
- I can't, Chris. I love you.

01:31:33.640 --> 01:31:36.770
Knox, you say that over and over.

01:31:36.850 --> 01:31:38.810
You don't...
You don't even know me.

01:31:38.890 --> 01:31:41.100
Will you be joining us, Mr. Overstreet?

01:31:41.150 --> 01:31:43.020
Go ahead, Captain. I'll walk.

01:31:43.110 --> 01:31:46.360
Knox. Knox,
it-it just so happens...

01:31:46.440 --> 01:31:49.990
that I could care less
about you.

01:31:52.950 --> 01:31:55.740
Then you wouldn't be here
warning me about Chet.

01:32:00.210 --> 01:32:03.000
I have to go.
I'm gonna be late for the play.

01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:06.090
- Are you going with him?
- Chet? To a play?

01:32:06.170 --> 01:32:08.130
- Are you kidding?
- Then come with me.

01:32:08.170 --> 01:32:10.170
Knox, you are so infuriating!

01:32:10.220 --> 01:32:12.680
Come on, Chris,
just give me one chance.

01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:15.470
If you don't like me after tonight,
I'll stay away forever.

01:32:15.560 --> 01:32:18.720
- Uh-huh.
- I promise. Dead Poets honor.

01:32:18.810 --> 01:32:20.310
You come with me tonight,

01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:22.900
and then if you don't want to see me
again, I swear I'll bow out.

01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:27.440
- What would happen if Chet found out?
- He won't know anything.

01:32:27.530 --> 01:32:30.650
We'll sit in the back
and sneak away as soon as it's over.

01:32:30.700 --> 01:32:34.370
And I suppose you would promise
that this would be the end of it?

01:32:34.450 --> 01:32:37.540
- Dead Poets honor.
- What is that?

01:32:39.870 --> 01:32:43.170
- My word.
- Hmm.

01:32:53.630 --> 01:32:56.640
You are so infuriating.

01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:20.410
Hey, there he is!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:23.500
Shh, boys.

01:33:30.090 --> 01:33:34.380
Either I mistake your shape
and making quite...

01:33:34.470 --> 01:33:39.850
or else you are that shrewd and
knavish sprite called Robin Goodfellow!

01:33:39.930 --> 01:33:41.850
Thou speak'st aright.

01:33:41.930 --> 01:33:44.100
I am that merry wanderer
of the night.

01:33:44.190 --> 01:33:47.020
I jest to Oberon
and make him smile...

01:33:47.110 --> 01:33:50.820
when I a fat and bean-fed
horse beguile.

01:33:50.900 --> 01:33:53.990
Neighing in the likeness
of a filly foal.

01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:56.740
Sometime lurk I
in a gossip's bowl...

01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:59.410
in very likeness
of a roasted crab.

01:33:59.490 --> 01:34:02.540
And when she drink,
against her lips I bob...

01:34:02.620 --> 01:34:05.210
and on her withered dewlap
pour the ale.

01:34:05.290 --> 01:34:07.380
- The wisest aunt
telling the saddest tale.
- He's good. He's really good.

01:34:07.460 --> 01:34:11.090
Sometime for three-foot stool
mistaketh me.

01:34:11.170 --> 01:34:14.880
Then slip I from her bum,
down topples she and "Tailor" cries...

01:34:14.970 --> 01:34:16.880
and falls into a cough.

01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:19.760
And then the whole quire
hold their hips and laugh...

01:34:19.850 --> 01:34:22.140
and waxen in their mirth
nee-e-e-eze...

01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:24.230
and swear.

01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:27.440
A merrier hour
was never wasted there.

01:34:27.520 --> 01:34:29.810
But, room, fairy.

01:34:29.900 --> 01:34:34.110
- Here comes Oberon.
- And here, my mistress.
Would that he were gone.

01:34:38.820 --> 01:34:41.160
Then by your side,
no bed-room me deny.

01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:44.250
For lying so, Hermia,
I do not lie.

01:34:44.330 --> 01:34:48.370
Lysander riddles very prettily.
Much beshrew my manners...

01:34:48.460 --> 01:34:51.590
and my pride if Hermia
meant to say Lysander lied.

01:34:51.670 --> 01:34:54.710
But, gentle friend,
for love and courtesy...

01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:57.930
lie further off;
in human modesty,

01:34:58.010 --> 01:35:01.390
such separation as may well be said
becomes a virtuous bachelor and maid.

01:35:01.470 --> 01:35:05.560
Good night, sweet friend. Thy love
ne'er alter 'til thy sweet life end.

01:35:05.640 --> 01:35:09.440
Amen.
Amen to that fair prayer, say I.

01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:12.020
- And then end life when I end loyalty.
- Neil. That's your cue, Neil.

01:35:12.110 --> 01:35:15.280
Come on, Neil.
Here's your crown. Let's go.

01:36:21.220 --> 01:36:23.680
If we shadows have offended...

01:36:25.390 --> 01:36:27.930
think but this
and all is mended.

01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:31.730
That you have but slumber'd here
while these visions did appear.

01:36:31.770 --> 01:36:36.110
And this weak and idle theme,
no more yielding but a dream.

01:36:37.280 --> 01:36:40.030
Gentles, do not reprehend.

01:36:40.110 --> 01:36:43.280
If you pardon, we will mend.

01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:46.990
And as I am an honest Puck,
if we have unearned luck,

01:36:47.080 --> 01:36:49.450
now to 'scape
the serpent's tongue,

01:36:49.540 --> 01:36:54.040
we will make amends ere long;
else the Puck a liar call.

01:36:56.920 --> 01:36:58.920
So, good night
unto you all.

01:36:59.010 --> 01:37:02.220
Give me your hands
if we be friends,

01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:06.220
and Robin shall
restore amends.

01:37:39.170 --> 01:37:41.760
Yawp! Carpe diem!

01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:05.200
That was great!

01:38:05.280 --> 01:38:08.870
Excuse me. I'm Neil's father.
I'd like to see him, please.

01:38:12.870 --> 01:38:17.170
Neil, your father.

01:38:17.210 --> 01:38:23.130
- What did you think?
- You were all just wonderful!

01:38:36.060 --> 01:38:37.980
Excuse me, please.

01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:41.900
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Neil! Back here! Neil!

01:38:41.980 --> 01:38:44.990
Neil, Neil, you were great!
Come back, Neil.

01:38:45.070 --> 01:38:47.030
- I can't, guys.
- Neil.

01:38:47.070 --> 01:38:49.030
Excuse me.

01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:53.450
Neil. Neil.
You have the gift.

01:38:53.540 --> 01:38:55.910
What a performance.
You left even me speechless.

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:58.290
- You have to stay with...
- Get in the car.

01:38:58.370 --> 01:39:02.000
Keating,
you stay away from my son.

01:39:02.090 --> 01:39:06.090
Neil! Neil!
Mr. Perry, come on!

01:39:06.170 --> 01:39:08.890
Don't make it
any worse than it is.

01:39:08.970 --> 01:39:12.810
Do you want to take the other car?

01:39:21.440 --> 01:39:23.730
Is it okay
if we walk back?

01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:26.780
Captain?

01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:31.910
- Knox?
- What?

01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:34.580
We'll be home about 11:30.

01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:15.030
We're trying very hard...

01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:19.580
to understand why it is
that you insist on defying us.

01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:25.170
But whatever the reason,
we're not gonna let you ruin your life.

01:40:25.250 --> 01:40:28.970
I'm withdrawing you from Welton and
enrolling you in Braden Military School.

01:40:29.010 --> 01:40:32.140
You're going to Harvard,
and you're gonna be a doctor.

01:40:35.220 --> 01:40:37.180
But that's ten more years.

01:40:37.220 --> 01:40:39.310
- Father, that's a lifetime!
- Oh, stop it!

01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:43.560
Don't be so dramatic.
You make it sound like a prison term.

01:40:44.770 --> 01:40:46.690
You don't understand, Neil.

01:40:46.770 --> 01:40:49.690
You have opportunities
that I never even dreamt of!

01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:52.780
- I am not going to let you waste them!
- I've got to tell you what I feel.

01:40:52.860 --> 01:40:55.950
- We've been so worried about...
- What? What? Tell me what you feel!

01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:00.120
What is it?

01:41:08.880 --> 01:41:12.880
Is it more of this...
this acting business?

01:41:12.970 --> 01:41:16.470
Because you can forget that.

01:41:16.550 --> 01:41:19.060
What?

01:41:23.730 --> 01:41:26.400
Nothing.

01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:41.580
Nothing?

01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:46.420
Well, then,
let's go to bed.

01:41:59.890 --> 01:42:05.480
I was good.
I was really good.

01:42:09.820 --> 01:42:12.280
Go on, get some sleep.

01:42:43.810 --> 01:42:48.440
It's going to be all right.

01:46:00.670 --> 01:46:03.880
What was that?

01:46:03.970 --> 01:46:06.800
What?

01:46:06.890 --> 01:46:10.890
- That sound.
- What sound?

01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:19.320
Tom?

01:46:22.900 --> 01:46:24.860
What is it?

01:46:26.360 --> 01:46:28.280
What's wrong?

01:46:38.170 --> 01:46:40.500
Neil?

01:46:46.050 --> 01:46:49.350
Tom, what is it?

01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:51.890
What's wrong?

01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:56.140
Neil?

01:47:01.230 --> 01:47:05.240
- Neil?
- I'll look outside.

01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:07.240
Neil?

01:47:25.010 --> 01:47:29.510
No!

01:47:29.590 --> 01:47:33.890
- Oh, Neil! Oh, my God!
- Oh, my God. Oh, no, no.

01:47:33.970 --> 01:47:36.770
- Oh, my son! My son! My poor son!
- He's all right.

01:47:36.850 --> 01:47:41.400
- He's all right!
- Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:47.240
Stop it! Stop it.

01:47:51.700 --> 01:47:55.500
Todd. Todd.

01:47:55.580 --> 01:47:58.460
Oh, Charlie.

01:48:04.460 --> 01:48:07.970
What is it?

01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:18.270
Neil's dead.

01:48:55.510 --> 01:48:57.560
It's so beautiful.

01:49:08.650 --> 01:49:11.240
Todd!

01:49:11.320 --> 01:49:12.860
- It's okay, Todd.
- Calm down.

01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:14.870
It's all right, Todd.

01:49:14.950 --> 01:49:16.870
- Todd, it's okay.
- It's okay, Todd.

01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:20.660
It's all right. It's all right.

01:49:20.710 --> 01:49:22.540
- He wouldn't have done it.
- You can't explain it, Todd.

01:49:22.620 --> 01:49:23.790
- It was his father!
- No!

01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:26.670
He wouldn't have left us.
It's because he...

01:49:26.710 --> 01:49:28.300
He wouldn't have.

01:49:28.380 --> 01:49:29.710
- His dad was...
- Todd.

01:49:29.800 --> 01:49:31.880
His-His father did it.
His father killed him.

01:49:31.970 --> 01:49:33.890
He made him do it.

01:49:35.010 --> 01:49:36.970
Todd!

01:49:37.050 --> 01:49:39.470
Leave him be.

01:51:38.590 --> 01:51:40.890
...All my life

01:51:40.970 --> 01:51:43.560
Shall surely

01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:48.900
Follow me

01:51:48.980 --> 01:51:53.400
And in God's house

01:51:53.480 --> 01:51:57.570
Forevermore

01:51:57.650 --> 01:52:02.080
My dwelling place

01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:06.410
Shall be

01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:12.250
Amen

01:52:18.420 --> 01:52:21.180
The death of Neil Perry is a tragedy.

01:52:24.760 --> 01:52:28.350
He was a fine student,

01:52:28.430 --> 01:52:32.360
one of Welton's best.

01:52:32.440 --> 01:52:35.190
And he will be missed.

01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:43.700
We've contacted each of your parents
to explain the situation.

01:52:43.780 --> 01:52:47.250
Naturally, they're all
quite concerned.

01:52:52.290 --> 01:52:55.550
At the request of Neil's family,

01:52:55.630 --> 01:53:01.220
I intend to conduct a thorough
inquiry into this matter.

01:53:02.640 --> 01:53:06.850
Your complete cooperation
is expected.

01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:19.190
- You told him about this meeting?
- Twice.

01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:21.530
That's it, guys.
We're all fried.

01:53:21.610 --> 01:53:24.530
- How do you mean?
- Cameron's a fink.

01:53:24.620 --> 01:53:27.910
- He's in Nolan's office now, finking.
- About what?

01:53:27.950 --> 01:53:31.040
The club, Pittsie.
Think about it.

01:53:31.120 --> 01:53:34.880
The board of directors,
the trustees and Mr. Nolan.

01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:38.550
Do you think for one moment they're
gonna let this thing just blow over?

01:53:38.630 --> 01:53:43.300
Schools go down because of things
like this. They need a scapegoat.

01:53:58.650 --> 01:54:00.780
What's going on, guys?

01:54:02.150 --> 01:54:04.450
You finked,
didn't you, Cameron?

01:54:04.490 --> 01:54:06.660
"Finked"? I don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:09.990
You told Nolan everything about
the club is what I'm talking about.

01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:12.000
Look, in case you hadn't heard,
Dalton, there's something...

01:54:12.080 --> 01:54:14.580
called an honor code
at this school, all right?

01:54:14.670 --> 01:54:18.340
If a teacher asks you a question,
you tell the truth or you're expelled.

01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:20.090
- You...
- Charlie!

01:54:20.170 --> 01:54:24.510
He's a rat! He's in it up to his eyes,
so he ratted to save himself!

01:54:24.590 --> 01:54:27.010
- Don't touch him, Charlie.
You do and you're out.
- I'm out anyway!

01:54:27.100 --> 01:54:30.010
- You don't know that. Not yet!
- He's right there, Charlie.

01:54:30.100 --> 01:54:34.310
And if you guys are smart, you will do
exactly what I did and cooperate.

01:54:34.350 --> 01:54:39.230
They're not after us.
We're the victims.

01:54:39.320 --> 01:54:41.980
Us and Neil.

01:54:42.030 --> 01:54:44.400
What's that mean?
Who are they after?

01:54:44.490 --> 01:54:47.870
Why, Mr. Keating, of course.
The "Captain" himself!

01:54:47.950 --> 01:54:51.700
You guys didn't really think he could
avoid responsibility, did you?

01:54:51.790 --> 01:54:55.540
Mr. Keating responsible for Neil?
Is that what they're saying?

01:54:55.620 --> 01:55:00.380
Well, who else do you think, dumb ass?
The administration? Mr. Perry?

01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:03.170
Mr. Keating put us up
to all this crap, didn't he?

01:55:03.210 --> 01:55:05.800
If it wasn't for Mr. Keating,
Neil would be...

01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:08.260
cozied up in his room right now,
studying his chemistry...

01:55:08.340 --> 01:55:10.430
- and dreaming of being called "Doctor"!
- That is not true, Cameron!

01:55:10.510 --> 01:55:13.060
You know that!
He didn't put us up to anything.

01:55:13.140 --> 01:55:15.640
- Neil loved acting.
- Believe what you want,

01:55:15.730 --> 01:55:18.400
but I say let Keating fry.

01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:22.110
I mean, why ruin our lives?

01:55:31.410 --> 01:55:34.700
You just signed
your expulsion papers, Nuwanda.

01:55:37.420 --> 01:55:41.750
And if the rest of you are smart,
you'll do exactly what I did!

01:55:43.090 --> 01:55:46.130
They know everything anyway.

01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:49.930
You can't save Keating,

01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:53.680
but you can save yourselves.

01:56:26.760 --> 01:56:29.340
Knox Overstreet.

01:56:55.790 --> 01:56:58.960
- Meeks.
- Go away. I have to study.

01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:02.880
What happened to Nuwanda?

01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:04.880
Expelled.

01:57:07.630 --> 01:57:09.720
What'd you tell 'em?

01:57:09.800 --> 01:57:12.720
Nothing they didn't
already know.

01:57:14.300 --> 01:57:16.760
Todd Anderson.

01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:40.960
- Hello, son.
- Hello, darling.

01:57:42.580 --> 01:57:44.500
Mom.

01:57:50.090 --> 01:57:52.510
Have a seat, Mr. Anderson.

01:57:58.600 --> 01:58:02.190
Mr. Anderson, I think we've pretty well
put together what's happened here.

01:58:02.270 --> 01:58:07.190
You do admit to being a part
of this Dead Poets Society?

01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:13.200
Answer him, Todd.

01:58:14.610 --> 01:58:16.570
Yes, sir.

01:58:18.120 --> 01:58:21.200
I have here
a detailed description...

01:58:21.290 --> 01:58:23.710
of what occurred at your meetings.

01:58:23.790 --> 01:58:25.710
It describes how your teacher,
Mr. Keating,

01:58:25.790 --> 01:58:27.750
encouraged you boys
to organize this club...

01:58:27.840 --> 01:58:31.050
and to use it as a source
of inspiration...

01:58:31.130 --> 01:58:33.720
for reckless
and self-indulgent behavior.

01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:38.850
It describes how Mr. Keating,
both in and out of the classroom,

01:58:38.930 --> 01:58:42.890
encouraged Neil Perry to follow
his obsession with acting...

01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:45.900
when he knew all along it was
against the explicit orders...

01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:48.480
of Neil's parents.

01:58:48.560 --> 01:58:52.490
It was Mr. Keating's blatant abuse
of his position as teacher...

01:58:52.570 --> 01:58:55.740
that led directly
to Neil Perry's death.

01:59:06.210 --> 01:59:08.460
Read that document carefully, Todd.

01:59:10.340 --> 01:59:12.880
Very carefully.

01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:21.640
If you've nothing
to add or amend, sign it.

01:59:21.720 --> 01:59:24.390
What's gonna happen
to Mr. Keating?

01:59:24.480 --> 01:59:29.060
I've had enough. Sign the paper, Todd!

01:59:33.320 --> 01:59:37.570
Grass is gramen or herba.

01:59:37.660 --> 01:59:39.870
Lapis is stone.

01:59:39.950 --> 01:59:44.080
The entire building
is aedificium.

02:00:20.450 --> 02:00:22.700
Sit.

02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:26.040
I'll be teaching this
class through exams.

02:00:26.120 --> 02:00:29.870
We'll find a permanent English teacher
during the break.

02:00:31.630 --> 02:00:35.880
Who will tell me where you are
in the Pritchard textbook?

02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:42.800
Mr. Anderson?

02:00:45.140 --> 02:00:48.230
- Uh, in the, in the Prit...
- I can't hear you, Mr. Anderson.

02:00:48.310 --> 02:00:51.940
In the, in the, in the Pritchard...

02:00:52.020 --> 02:00:54.730
Kindly inform me, Mr. Cameron.

02:00:54.820 --> 02:00:56.730
We skipped around a lot, sir.

02:00:56.820 --> 02:01:00.820
We covered the romantics and some of the
chapters on post-Civil War literature.

02:01:00.910 --> 02:01:06.290
- What about the realists?
- We skipped most of that, sir.

02:01:06.370 --> 02:01:09.160
All right, then,
we'll start over.

02:01:11.370 --> 02:01:14.540
What is poetry?

02:01:16.500 --> 02:01:20.010
Come!

02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:26.680
Excuse me.

02:01:26.760 --> 02:01:29.390
I came for my personals.

02:01:29.430 --> 02:01:31.730
Should I come back
after class?

02:01:31.770 --> 02:01:33.900
Get them now,
Mr. Keating.

02:01:36.270 --> 02:01:40.190
Gentlemen, turn to page 21
of the introduction.

02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:42.950
Mr. Cameron,

02:01:43.030 --> 02:01:48.370
read aloud the excellent essay
by Dr. Pritchard...

02:01:48.450 --> 02:01:50.910
on "Understanding Poetry."

02:01:52.620 --> 02:01:54.830
That page has been
ripped out, sir.

02:01:54.920 --> 02:01:57.210
Well, borrow
somebody else's book.

02:01:57.300 --> 02:01:59.300
They're all ripped out, sir.

02:01:59.380 --> 02:02:02.760
What do you mean,
"They're all ripped out"?

02:02:02.800 --> 02:02:06.260
- Sir, we...
- Never mind.

02:02:09.810 --> 02:02:11.810
Read.

02:02:15.020 --> 02:02:19.360
"Understanding Poetry"
by Dr. J. Evans Pritchard, Ph. D.

02:02:19.440 --> 02:02:21.530
"To fully understand poetry,
we must first be fluent...

02:02:21.610 --> 02:02:24.200
"with its meter, rhyme
and figures of speech.

02:02:26.280 --> 02:02:29.830
"How artfully has the objective
of the poem been rendered?

02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:35.880
"How important
is that objective?

02:02:35.960 --> 02:02:37.540
"Question one
rates the poem's perfection.

02:02:37.630 --> 02:02:39.550
"Question two rates its importance.

02:02:39.630 --> 02:02:41.550
"And once these questions
have been answered,

02:02:41.630 --> 02:02:45.220
"determining a poem's greatness
becomes a relatively simple matter.

02:02:45.300 --> 02:02:48.390
If the poem's score for perfection is
plotted on the horizontal of a graph..."

02:02:48.470 --> 02:02:50.770
- Mr. Keating!
They made everybody sign it.
- Quiet, Mr. Anderson!

02:02:50.850 --> 02:02:53.310
- You've got to believe me. It's true.
- I do believe you, Todd.

02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:55.400
- Leave, Mr. Keating.
- But it wasn't his fault!

02:02:55.480 --> 02:02:59.230
Sit down, Mr. Anderson! One more
outburst from you or anyone else,

02:02:59.320 --> 02:03:01.230
and you're out of this school!

02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:03.240
Leave, Mr. Keating.

02:03:04.700 --> 02:03:07.990
I said, "Leave, Mr. Keating."

02:03:23.210 --> 02:03:27.680
- Oh, Captain, my Captain.
- Sit down, Mr. Anderson.

02:03:29.680 --> 02:03:32.140
Do you hear me?
Sit down!

02:03:32.220 --> 02:03:34.980
Sit down!

02:03:36.520 --> 02:03:40.020
This is your final warning,
Anderson.

02:03:40.110 --> 02:03:44.360
How dare you.
Do you hear me?

02:03:44.440 --> 02:03:46.950
Oh, Captain, my Captain.

02:03:48.360 --> 02:03:49.820
Mr. Overstreet, I warn you!

02:03:49.910 --> 02:03:51.870
Sit down!

02:03:54.160 --> 02:03:56.580
Sit down!

02:03:56.660 --> 02:04:00.250
Sit down! All of you!
I want you seated!

02:04:00.330 --> 02:04:03.420
Sit down!
Leave, Mr. Keating.

02:04:11.850 --> 02:04:14.470
All of you, down!
I want you seated!

02:04:14.560 --> 02:04:18.390
Do you hear me?

02:04:22.110 --> 02:04:25.230
Sit down!

02:05:05.320 --> 02:05:08.440
Thank you, boys.

02:05:08.490 --> 02:05:11.030
Thank you.
