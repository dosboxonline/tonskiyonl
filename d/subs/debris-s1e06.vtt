WEBVTT

00:04.587 --> 00:06.589
ANNOUNCER:
Previously on Debris...

00:06.631 --> 00:11.136
My dad was the first to be told
the truth about what they found.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.972
-MADDOX: George Jones,
he's alive.
-BRYAN: That's impossible.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.307
We're just gonna
have to sit on this
for a little while, okay?

00:16.349 --> 00:17.976
BRYAN:
There are things that I know

00:18.018 --> 00:20.687
that you will not
find very palatable.

00:20.729 --> 00:21.980
I need you to trust me.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.023
FERRIS: It's your father.

00:23.064 --> 00:24.190
He may still be alive.

00:24.232 --> 00:25.734
Bryan knows, too.

00:25.775 --> 00:27.152
FINOLA: Why did we even
bother with this alliance?

00:27.652 --> 00:30.071
BRILL: Ferris. She knows more
than she's telling you.

00:30.113 --> 00:32.699
-FINOLA: I want to catch
these guys, Bryan.
-BRYAN: We will.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.367
JULIA: I know
what it takes from you

00:34.409 --> 00:35.869
to control the fate
of the world.

00:35.910 --> 00:38.079
I accept this,
I accept all of this.

00:38.121 --> 00:40.081
Let's just look out
for each other, yeah?

00:40.123 --> 00:41.791
BRYAN: It's been a long time
since somebody's looked at me

00:41.833 --> 00:44.210
like a human being.
When I first met you,

00:44.252 --> 00:46.171
I doubted you could
do this job.

00:47.297 --> 00:48.548
I shouldn't have.

01:22.248 --> 01:25.502
(electricity buzzing)

01:28.838 --> 01:31.466
(exhales)

01:41.142 --> 01:43.561
(car door opens)

01:49.442 --> 01:51.736
GIRL:
What do we do now?

01:59.452 --> 02:02.330
We have to try again.

02:02.372 --> 02:04.457
We need more people.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.879
**

02:18.888 --> 02:21.891
** (theme)

02:50.795 --> 02:52.756
(Bryan sighs)

02:57.344 --> 02:58.845
You know,
when they designed it,

02:58.887 --> 03:01.014
I really don't think
NASA engineers

03:01.056 --> 03:03.892
intended that to be your
personal toaster oven, Bryan.

03:03.933 --> 03:06.686
Have you ever heard
of the Dustbuster?

03:06.728 --> 03:10.190
UV sunglasses?
Memory foam mattresses?

03:10.231 --> 03:12.734
All developed by NASA,

03:12.776 --> 03:15.987
so I'm just ahead of
the curve, so to speak.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.865
Wow, you're just like
a human crystal ball.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.409
It's a curse.

03:26.456 --> 03:28.249
Is everything all right?

03:28.291 --> 03:29.751
Yeah.

03:32.712 --> 03:35.423
When we were in New York,
my sister sent me

03:35.465 --> 03:39.678
an old... family video

03:39.719 --> 03:42.722
of us on the Isle of Wight
when we were kids.

03:43.431 --> 03:45.475
It just made me
think about my dad.

03:46.935 --> 03:50.397
He was in Greece
the summer before he died,

03:50.438 --> 03:53.441
and he sent me an email
to say that he found

03:53.483 --> 03:57.195
the perfect present
he was gonna buy himself

03:57.237 --> 04:00.073
for his birthday,
for me to gift him.

04:00.115 --> 04:02.075
Is that something
that he would do a lot?

04:02.117 --> 04:07.330
Yeah. And then he would always
act surprised when he opened it.

04:08.456 --> 04:09.833
What was the present?

04:11.960 --> 04:14.421
I don't know.

04:14.462 --> 04:16.965
I never got the chance
to find out.

04:19.384 --> 04:21.636
That's what
I was thinking about.

04:24.556 --> 04:27.517
You sure you don't want
in on one of these?

04:27.559 --> 04:29.769
Mm-mm, I'm quite sure.

04:29.811 --> 04:31.312
Okay.

04:32.147 --> 04:33.940
Your loss.

04:51.291 --> 04:52.751
Did you do what I asked?

04:52.792 --> 04:55.754
Yes. I still don't know
why you wanted me to tell him

04:55.795 --> 04:58.298
my father was in Greece
before he died.

04:58.340 --> 05:00.133
And how did Bryan respond?

05:00.175 --> 05:02.218
He just listened
to the story.

05:02.260 --> 05:03.636
What's going on?

05:03.678 --> 05:05.680
You trust me, don't you?

05:06.389 --> 05:07.807
I do.

05:07.849 --> 05:10.268
Now, if he brings it up again,
mention Cyprus,

05:10.310 --> 05:11.644
that you think
he was there, too.

05:11.686 --> 05:14.230
Who was that agent
you sent to deliver me

05:14.272 --> 05:16.649
the memory stick with
the China files in New York?

05:16.691 --> 05:19.527
That's Agent Brill. Why?

05:19.569 --> 05:22.030
Oh, I've just never
met him before.

05:22.072 --> 05:25.241
He's dependable.
Don't forget about Cyprus.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.369
I'll be in touch.

05:27.869 --> 05:29.371
Copy that.

05:31.247 --> 05:33.750
**

05:42.050 --> 05:43.927
-(car door closes)
-FINOLA: What do we got?

05:43.968 --> 05:46.763
Local PD was alerted by
a woman walking her dog.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.515
She said she saw
four or five teenagers

05:48.556 --> 05:49.849
near the house
a few days ago.

05:49.891 --> 05:51.685
They were in
a banged-up sedan.

05:51.726 --> 05:54.145
Then this morning
her dog led her inside
to the bodies.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.106
How many bodies
are we talking about?

05:56.147 --> 05:58.525
Three. We're still searching
the woods for the Debris.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.443
They're clicking at
190 on the Laghari.

06:00.485 --> 06:01.736
FINOLA: Okay. Thanks, Tom.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.572
Dr. Masakela.

06:04.614 --> 06:07.701
DR. MASAKELA: Over here.
How you doing?

06:07.742 --> 06:09.744
FINOLA: All right.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.913
This is oddly peaceful.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.041
They all died here
in the house.

06:15.083 --> 06:17.335
-FINOLA: When?
-It was recent.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.755
It's like the life was
literally sucked out of them.

06:21.881 --> 06:23.883
Whatever happened,
the Debris seems

06:23.925 --> 06:26.803
to have left each one with
a faint electrostatic field.

06:26.845 --> 06:28.680
Where is the energy
coming from?

06:28.722 --> 06:30.473
Low relative humidity
is creating

06:30.515 --> 06:32.392
an electrostatic
buildup in this area.

06:32.434 --> 06:34.352
And the bodies
are containing it.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.104
Enough to charge
a cell phone.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.607
DR. MASAKELA: Convenient
in this remote location.

06:55.623 --> 06:56.750
BRYAN: Bill Jarvah.

06:56.791 --> 06:59.544
-What is that?
-Medical ID.

07:01.463 --> 07:04.424
Bill Jarvah
was reported missing

07:04.466 --> 07:07.093
by local PD
three days ago.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.303
Who were the other two?

07:08.345 --> 07:10.263
Another man
was reported missing,

07:10.305 --> 07:11.723
also in his eighties, same day.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.266
And then the day before that,

07:13.308 --> 07:16.227
a woman disappeared from
a assisted living facility.

07:16.269 --> 07:17.979
I think we just found them.

07:18.980 --> 07:21.441
Why are they older people,
and what happened to them?

07:21.483 --> 07:23.818
At their age, they could barely
make it through the forest.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.862
Someone brought them here.

07:26.321 --> 07:31.159
The teenagers,
the ones the dog walker saw.

07:31.201 --> 07:34.496
BRYAN: Dr. Masakela,
you said it was like

07:34.537 --> 07:36.956
their life was
sucked out of them.

07:36.998 --> 07:39.834
FINOLA: If someone
used Debris to do this,

07:39.876 --> 07:41.628
what could they be
getting from them?

07:41.670 --> 07:43.171
Not much.
Once I get them back

07:43.213 --> 07:45.507
to the lab at Langley,
I'll know more.

07:46.508 --> 07:47.967
Great.

07:50.178 --> 07:52.013
(door buzzes)

07:55.058 --> 07:57.560
Oh, room service.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.896
It's about bloody time.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.523
I've been here for hours.

08:01.564 --> 08:05.110
I'll have a Moo Goo Gai Pan.

08:05.151 --> 08:08.863
And how about some of those...
those fortune cookies?

08:08.905 --> 08:11.157
Let's have
some of those, too.

08:11.199 --> 08:12.534
Anson Ash.

08:16.162 --> 08:20.208
Ex-SAS, Special
Reconnaissance Regiment.

08:20.250 --> 08:24.796
Infiltrated the IRA
in Northern Ireland.

08:24.838 --> 08:28.800
It says here you abandoned
your military duty.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.931
Tell me about Influx.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.561
Who's funding you?

08:40.478 --> 08:42.230
We know it's not
the Russians.

08:42.272 --> 08:44.774
Or the Chinese.

08:44.816 --> 08:46.609
What do you want?

08:46.651 --> 08:49.070
Definitely not what
you lot want.

08:50.822 --> 08:53.616
You want
geopolitical dominance.

08:53.658 --> 08:55.952
You want to rule the world.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.750
You don't get
to control this Debris.

09:01.791 --> 09:06.379
This technology is meant
to free the world,

09:06.421 --> 09:08.798
not entrap it.

09:11.801 --> 09:15.013
I find it interesting
that you don't understand

09:15.055 --> 09:16.890
that we are suddenly
in the presence

09:16.931 --> 09:19.059
of a power so vast,

09:19.100 --> 09:23.313
with both the possibility
of good and evil,

09:24.147 --> 09:26.816
and you don't know
which side you're on.

09:30.195 --> 09:31.488
But you do.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.406
You're on the side of good.

09:33.448 --> 09:36.910
You're just a guy
who's trying to make
the world a better place

09:36.951 --> 09:41.122
by opening up wormholes
in Manhattan, yeah?

09:41.164 --> 09:43.500
You think it should
all just be out there,

09:43.541 --> 09:46.878
available to anybody
who comes across it?
Is that right?

09:48.463 --> 09:51.466
I am just a guy...

09:51.508 --> 09:57.263
who wants some
Moo Goo Gai Pan.

10:03.645 --> 10:07.023
We know you switched out
George's dead body
in the morgue.

10:07.941 --> 10:10.568
Did you reanimate him
with Debris?

10:11.319 --> 10:14.322
I think we all know
the rules here.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.992
There are no rules.

10:19.536 --> 10:21.705
Not since the arrival.

10:27.502 --> 10:31.423
Are you torturing George Jones
to learn our secrets?

10:39.180 --> 10:41.933
That's a good idea,
you should get some sleep.

10:44.019 --> 10:47.689
Next time you see me,
you're going to need
all your energy.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.822
Anson has had
four incoming calls.

10:55.864 --> 10:57.949
Proprietary software
scrambled the ID,

10:57.991 --> 10:59.743
but whoever they are,
they keep calling back.

11:00.410 --> 11:03.246
MADDOX: He's not talking,
so this is all we got.

11:03.288 --> 11:06.958
All right, just stay on it.
I need to find out where
those calls are coming from.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.336
You gotta crack that phone.

11:35.570 --> 11:36.946
Chalk?

11:38.448 --> 11:41.868
Sometimes hikers mark trees
so they don't get lost.

11:41.910 --> 11:43.912
There's another one.

11:45.455 --> 11:48.291
I'm gonna get some more agents
to search the area, okay?

11:48.333 --> 11:50.043
(phone buzzes)

11:50.085 --> 11:52.337
Hey, George Jones
was in Romania

11:52.379 --> 11:55.840
for a series of conferences
just before his death.

11:55.882 --> 11:58.718
I need you to find out
if he was anywhere near
the Mediterranean

11:58.760 --> 12:01.304
-when he was there.
-Okay.

12:01.346 --> 12:05.350
Malta, Cyprus...
It's important that I know.

12:06.601 --> 12:07.977
(sighs)

12:08.019 --> 12:10.105
Finola just told me
a story on the plane

12:10.146 --> 12:12.565
about her father
being in Greece a month
before his death.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.109
He emailed her.

12:14.150 --> 12:16.111
I'm trying to figure out
if Influx had some sort of

12:16.152 --> 12:18.196
long-term plan
to capture George,

12:18.238 --> 12:20.532
and I want to know if they
were tracking him even then.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.368
So I may need some more
information from Finola.

12:24.202 --> 12:28.164
How long was he there,
exact dates,
etcetera, etcetera.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.958
I need anything you can get.

12:30.709 --> 12:31.918
Copy?

12:31.960 --> 12:33.253
Okay.

12:37.007 --> 12:40.468
Hey. They've confirmed
through dental records

12:40.510 --> 12:42.595
that the corpses they found
were the missing elderly,

12:42.637 --> 12:45.098
but we just got a report
that another elderly man

12:45.140 --> 12:46.933
named Caspian Cole, 80s,

12:46.975 --> 12:48.852
just went missing
in a town east of there

12:48.893 --> 12:51.104
called McMinnville,
Tennessee.

12:51.146 --> 12:54.649
Whoever's doing this
is there now.

12:54.691 --> 12:58.987
**

13:41.154 --> 13:43.531
Stop! Don't go any further.

13:43.573 --> 13:45.075
BOY: 237.

13:46.326 --> 13:47.577
Told you.

13:52.749 --> 13:54.459
This is good.

13:55.752 --> 13:57.128
I'm okay, I'm okay.

13:57.170 --> 14:00.215
We're back on track.
Soon we'll be free.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.300
We just gotta find
a few more.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.095
We have to keep going.

14:14.145 --> 14:16.564
TARKOLOV:
Not many Americans...

14:16.606 --> 14:19.067
know who Yuri Gagarin was.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.403
That's because
it doesn't matter
if you're the first

14:21.444 --> 14:24.114
person in space if
you don't land on the moon.

14:25.115 --> 14:28.201
And that's what we did.
So, you know,

14:28.243 --> 14:30.286
of course everybody knows
who Neil Armstrong is.

14:30.328 --> 14:32.747
History is kindest
to the victors.

14:32.789 --> 14:37.836
Those above me want
history to be kind
to Russia now.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.297
They're willing
to make the trade
for the piece you want.

14:41.339 --> 14:44.217
No reason both countries

14:44.259 --> 14:47.345
can't take their place
in the history books this time.

14:48.138 --> 14:49.514
When can I see it?

14:49.556 --> 14:51.141
Not long now.

14:51.182 --> 14:53.309
I'll pick you up
at 8:00 tonight.

14:56.855 --> 14:59.357
Local PD found
surveillance footage
of Caspian Cole

14:59.399 --> 15:02.193
being abducted
four blocks from the house.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.529
According to the time stamp,

15:04.571 --> 15:06.406
they were talking
for about twenty minutes.

15:06.448 --> 15:10.785
There's a second man
reported missing now
two hours after.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.246
Jose Manza,
ninety years old.

15:13.288 --> 15:15.749
Last seen ten blocks
from the same place.

15:15.790 --> 15:18.209
(phone buzzes)

15:18.251 --> 15:19.586
-Tom.
-Yeah,

15:19.627 --> 15:21.338
we just located a car
matching the description

15:21.379 --> 15:22.964
from the crime scene
in Ennville.

15:23.006 --> 15:25.300
It's parked by the woods
north east of Collins Road.

15:25.342 --> 15:26.676
No plates.

15:26.718 --> 15:28.762
-Ping me your location.
-You got it.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.849
Definitely traces of Debris.

15:33.600 --> 15:36.644
It was here.
Not too long ago.

15:36.686 --> 15:38.772
I'm picking up
a steady 60.

15:45.070 --> 15:47.655
These are some of
the victims' clothes.

15:47.697 --> 15:48.990
(phone rings)

15:49.032 --> 15:50.658
This is Bryan.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.413
It's Kearn. Bad time?

15:56.247 --> 15:57.707
I got a minute.
What's up?

15:57.749 --> 15:59.834
We're looking
for her personal emails

15:59.876 --> 16:01.711
from when George
was in Greece.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.339
What are you talking about?

16:04.381 --> 16:07.008
Agent Jones.
We're in her apartment.

16:07.050 --> 16:08.551
We got nothing
from her journals,

16:08.593 --> 16:10.720
so we're going
through everything.

16:13.014 --> 16:14.933
-You're in her apartment.
-Yeah,

16:14.974 --> 16:16.935
Maddox said
you were up to speed.

16:17.435 --> 16:20.563
He said you might have
had access to her password.

16:23.191 --> 16:25.819
He made it pretty clear
that he needs this soon.

16:26.736 --> 16:28.405
Are you there?

16:29.948 --> 16:32.617
I don't have
that information right now.

16:33.702 --> 16:36.246
You're on your own.
I gotta go.

16:38.623 --> 16:40.083
What do you think?

16:43.753 --> 16:45.588
Let's run the VIN.

16:55.932 --> 16:57.851
It's a bit cold out here.

17:01.771 --> 17:03.565
What's your name?

17:03.606 --> 17:05.108
Subash.

17:06.443 --> 17:08.778
Want me
to sit with you, Subash?

17:17.037 --> 17:20.707
So, why are you all alone?
You don't have any family?

17:24.627 --> 17:28.548
My sons...
live in a different city.

17:29.632 --> 17:34.471
So they're just
living their lives
and forgetting you exist, huh?

17:35.972 --> 17:37.932
You know, sometimes I...

17:37.974 --> 17:41.227
I feel...

17:41.269 --> 17:44.189
they are just
waiting for me to die.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.454
I can help you with that.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.475
(phone buzzes)

18:31.653 --> 18:34.739
(sighs)

18:34.781 --> 18:37.283
Nothing.

18:37.325 --> 18:38.702
Still quiet.

18:46.418 --> 18:48.461
(sighs)

18:48.503 --> 18:51.881
That story, the one
you shared on the plane.

18:53.758 --> 18:54.884
Yeah?

18:54.926 --> 18:56.761
It stuck with me.

18:57.721 --> 19:00.515
That bit about George
buying presents for himself.

19:01.141 --> 19:06.187
Nobody talked about that side
of your father at Orbital,

19:06.229 --> 19:11.151
just that he was
this hyper-focused...

19:11.192 --> 19:14.863
gifted, out-there genius.

19:15.822 --> 19:18.116
Hmm.

19:18.158 --> 19:20.618
Well, yeah.
He was that, too.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.579
Out there. Definitely.

19:22.620 --> 19:25.206
You should have been there
when he did his papers

19:25.248 --> 19:28.209
on children's nightmares.

19:28.251 --> 19:30.295
What do you mean?

19:34.132 --> 19:38.595
He was obsessed with
neurological computing,

19:38.636 --> 19:41.765
and so he thought nightmares
might be the brain's way

19:41.806 --> 19:45.643
of solving
differential equations.

19:45.685 --> 19:49.564
So, yeah,
lots of therapy on that one.

19:49.606 --> 19:55.070
I don't know. It's like,
everything I've heard,

19:55.111 --> 19:59.407
he didn't sound like
the type that would just
jet off to Greece.

20:01.451 --> 20:03.453
And Cyprus.

20:05.830 --> 20:07.999
He really loved it there, too.

20:22.639 --> 20:26.059
Why are you asking me
about my father, Bryan?

20:31.648 --> 20:34.943
Because your father is alive.

20:58.216 --> 20:59.759
I know.

21:00.844 --> 21:04.556
And I know that you
and Maddox knew.

21:06.558 --> 21:08.643
Why did you tell me?

21:10.020 --> 21:13.106
I just told you.

21:13.148 --> 21:15.442
Isn't that enough?

21:16.234 --> 21:17.610
When did Maddox find out?

21:17.652 --> 21:18.987
Two weeks ago.

21:19.029 --> 21:21.614
And what do you
know about it?

21:21.656 --> 21:23.116
Why was he taken?

21:23.158 --> 21:25.535
I only saw footage of him
coming into JFK

21:25.577 --> 21:29.414
from out of the country
with Anson Ash and another
Influx operative.

21:30.248 --> 21:33.084
But the last I heard,
Maddox was trying to rule out

21:33.126 --> 21:34.794
if it was a clone or not.

21:37.756 --> 21:39.591
Well, it's not a clone.
It's him.

21:39.632 --> 21:40.884
How do you know that?

21:40.925 --> 21:42.719
I just do.

21:42.761 --> 21:45.889
Did he die or not?

21:47.432 --> 21:49.434
You said you saw his body.

21:49.476 --> 21:51.978
I did.

22:00.362 --> 22:04.824
Maddox wanted me to get
the information off you
about his trip to Greece

22:04.866 --> 22:07.994
to see if Influx was
tracking him before his death.

22:11.623 --> 22:13.667
That's all I know.

22:15.794 --> 22:18.880
I need to know
if I can trust you
with what I've told you.

22:42.904 --> 22:45.073
(gasping)

22:46.032 --> 22:47.909
Have some water.

22:47.951 --> 22:49.244
Here.

22:53.581 --> 22:55.542
-Better?
-(sighs)

22:55.583 --> 22:57.585
(siren in distance)

23:00.338 --> 23:02.007
Go to the car.
Check that out.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.216
Come on.

23:10.306 --> 23:12.183
KURT: It's okay.

23:13.518 --> 23:15.186
Don't be afraid.

23:16.813 --> 23:19.524
It happens so fast,
and it doesn't hurt at all.

23:20.442 --> 23:23.153
Just hold on to it,
no matter what.

23:25.989 --> 23:27.032
(sighs)

23:29.576 --> 23:30.994
Okay.

23:40.211 --> 23:42.756
(Debris trilling)

23:51.181 --> 23:54.642
Hey, stop!
We're federal agents!

24:00.398 --> 24:01.941
(Debris trilling)

24:11.326 --> 24:13.745
(grunting)

24:14.621 --> 24:16.206
You have to let me go!

24:16.247 --> 24:18.708
-Where is it?
-I don't have it! He does!

24:18.750 --> 24:21.252
Where is Caspian Cole?

24:21.294 --> 24:23.046
-Jose Manza?
-(grunting, struggling)

24:23.088 --> 24:25.465
Jose Manza and Caspian Cole!

24:25.507 --> 24:27.801
Where are they?
What are you doing to them?

24:29.386 --> 24:31.763
I am Caspian Cole.

24:33.431 --> 24:36.017
(Debris trilling)

25:10.677 --> 25:12.929
It's-- It's a miracle.

25:19.185 --> 25:22.939
Like I said,
you have to stay near us.

25:22.981 --> 25:24.941
You're with us now.

25:33.533 --> 25:36.870
Kurt! Kurt!
Kurt, Kurt, Kurt!

25:37.328 --> 25:38.204
Let's go.

25:40.331 --> 25:42.000
You have to stay with us!
You have to!

25:42.042 --> 25:45.211
We gotta go!
Come on, let's go!

25:56.890 --> 25:59.392
(gasping)

26:01.770 --> 26:03.396
(panting)

26:14.574 --> 26:15.700
We have to go.

26:15.742 --> 26:16.868
We can't leave them.

26:16.910 --> 26:18.828
We gotta keep running.

26:18.870 --> 26:20.288
We need to get
the others back.

26:20.330 --> 26:22.248
I don't know
who these people are,

26:22.290 --> 26:24.250
but they know
what we're doing.

26:25.377 --> 26:29.255
They will die
if we run further.

26:29.297 --> 26:33.134
I can't let that
happen again.

26:35.428 --> 26:39.391
After it happens,
we can't get too far from it.

26:39.432 --> 26:42.352
But he said he knew
how to stop that.

26:42.394 --> 26:43.853
What do you mean?

26:45.355 --> 26:49.067
You have to let us go.
We will die.

26:49.109 --> 26:52.862
He won't stay.
I can feel that
it's close to happening.

26:52.904 --> 26:54.406
I can feel it.

26:54.447 --> 26:58.284
We're on the outer reaches
of being too far from it.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.079
Where did it come from?

27:01.121 --> 27:03.456
He said that
he prayed for it.

27:03.498 --> 27:05.959
Don't you believe it?

27:06.710 --> 27:08.670
Look at what he's done.

27:08.712 --> 27:10.964
I'm 85 years old.

27:11.006 --> 27:13.049
It's a miracle.

27:16.261 --> 27:18.888
I wished that I would die...

27:18.930 --> 27:22.100
so many times.

27:22.142 --> 27:24.519
That I would just disappear.

27:25.145 --> 27:27.397
Do you know what
kind of hell that is?

27:28.148 --> 27:30.734
And then he found me,

27:30.775 --> 27:33.028
and he told me
he could do this.

27:34.988 --> 27:37.198
What will happen to me now?

27:38.366 --> 27:43.163
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.500
Where's Bryan?
We found another one of these

27:47.542 --> 27:50.003
in the woods where
Caspian Cole was running.

27:50.045 --> 27:52.339
Kurt wants to talk.

27:56.843 --> 27:59.471
BRYAN: Kurt?

27:59.512 --> 28:01.139
Who are you?

28:01.181 --> 28:05.560
We're here to help.
We've got Caspian and Subash.

28:05.602 --> 28:06.978
Where's Jose?

28:07.020 --> 28:09.189
Jose Manza is dead.

28:09.230 --> 28:13.026
And all this has to stop
before anyone else dies.

28:13.693 --> 28:15.403
Jose is dead
because of you.

28:15.445 --> 28:19.199
You killed him.
You did, you forced him
to run too far away.

28:19.240 --> 28:21.326
Kurt, what
you're doing is wrong.

28:21.368 --> 28:23.787
No, actually I'm not
doing anything wrong.

28:23.828 --> 28:27.165
I'm helping people who deserve
a chance at a second life.

28:27.207 --> 28:29.876
People who have been
left all alone.

28:29.918 --> 28:32.087
Look, I know
that you know what it does,

28:32.128 --> 28:33.838
or you wouldn't be here
looking for it.

28:33.880 --> 28:35.465
I know you know.

28:35.507 --> 28:36.466
I know.

28:36.508 --> 28:39.010
So, then help them
by helping me.

28:39.052 --> 28:40.512
Tell me the math.

28:40.553 --> 28:42.138
The math?

28:42.180 --> 28:44.182
The key to it is numbers.

28:44.224 --> 28:46.142
The more people
that it makes young,

28:46.184 --> 28:48.311
the farther away from it
we can be.

28:48.353 --> 28:50.355
If I could
get the math right...

28:50.397 --> 28:53.274
If I can get enough people,
if I can just figure it out,

28:53.316 --> 28:55.694
then none of us
have to be near it anymore.

28:55.735 --> 28:57.028
All of us.

28:57.070 --> 28:58.363
You know that's not working.

28:58.405 --> 29:00.407
We found the bodies
in the house.

29:00.448 --> 29:03.910
If you don't stop,
more innocent people
are going to die.

29:03.952 --> 29:05.870
No, you're gonna
let my friends go.

29:05.912 --> 29:08.248
You're gonna
pack up your trucks
and you're gonna leave

29:08.289 --> 29:10.625
or else I'm gonna--
I'm gonna disappear,

29:10.667 --> 29:14.295
and Caspian and Subash's blood
will be on your hands too.

29:18.258 --> 29:20.093
BRYAN:
So, what've you got for me?

29:20.135 --> 29:21.970
From what I can tell,
the Debris uses

29:22.012 --> 29:26.516
an epigenetic program
to control, and reverse,
the aging process.

29:26.558 --> 29:31.730
It commandeers DNA
methylation pathways,
thereby restoring youth.

29:31.771 --> 29:33.106
But when the Debris is absent,

29:33.148 --> 29:34.649
everything snaps back
with a vengeance.

29:34.691 --> 29:36.735
It's like
a biological boomerang.

29:36.776 --> 29:40.405
Right, but in your voicemail,
you said you could undo it?

29:40.447 --> 29:43.450
Yes, I believe that we can
moderate the boomerang effect.

29:43.491 --> 29:46.745
I just need you to keep them
alive and get me the Debris.

29:46.786 --> 29:48.580
The subjects could be
returned to where they were

29:48.621 --> 29:51.541
before all this happened,
old but alive.

29:51.583 --> 29:53.293
Thanks.

29:53.877 --> 29:56.546
Bryan, you got a minute?

29:57.922 --> 29:59.966
Just came for you.

30:00.884 --> 30:02.218
Why so early?

30:02.719 --> 30:04.054
I don't know.

30:04.095 --> 30:06.973
Maybe something came back
in your blood work.

30:17.817 --> 30:19.486
(grunts)

30:24.949 --> 30:26.409
(knock on door)

30:30.997 --> 30:32.207
Hey.

30:33.333 --> 30:35.669
We just got word back
on the Chrysler.

30:37.087 --> 30:40.423
It's Kurt's car.
His name is Kurt Cox.

30:40.465 --> 30:42.342
He was an engineer
from Knoxville.

30:43.051 --> 30:46.137
The girl he's with
is Clara Cox.
They're husband and wife.

30:46.179 --> 30:47.972
They've been married for
over fifty years.

30:48.807 --> 30:50.517
He took her from
a care facility
where she was

30:50.558 --> 30:53.103
suffering from
end stage dementia.

30:53.937 --> 30:56.564
So, he got his wife back.

30:57.774 --> 30:59.693
Mm-hmm.

31:15.583 --> 31:18.586
Okay.
I'm gonna take care of this.

31:18.628 --> 31:20.714
BRYAN:
Kurt, are you there?

31:23.800 --> 31:25.176
You're prepared to leave?

31:25.218 --> 31:27.012
I'm afraid
I can't do that, man.

31:27.053 --> 31:29.389
-KURT: No, No.
-TOM: We're getting closer.

31:29.431 --> 31:32.225
I will leave,
I will disappear,

31:32.267 --> 31:34.060
and you will
never see me again.

31:34.102 --> 31:36.396
They will be dead
because of you.

31:36.438 --> 31:39.024
There is a chance that
we can undo you've done,

31:39.065 --> 31:40.567
but you gotta trust me.

31:40.608 --> 31:42.736
Going back to what we were
is not an option.

31:42.777 --> 31:45.822
I know that you took
Clara from a facility.

31:45.864 --> 31:50.243
I understand her condition,
I understand that you
think this is a miracle.

31:50.285 --> 31:52.662
You have no idea what
you're dealing with.

31:52.704 --> 31:54.247
I won't send her back
to that hell.

31:54.289 --> 31:55.790
TOM: Not far now.

31:57.000 --> 31:58.585
I've already lost Clara once.

31:58.626 --> 32:01.296
I believe that
I found this for a reason.

32:01.338 --> 32:03.715
Where did you
find it, Kurt?

32:04.632 --> 32:07.260
I was by some cliffs
near my house.

32:07.302 --> 32:09.596
It seemed to beckon me.

32:09.637 --> 32:12.432
And when I picked it up
and it transformed me, I knew.

32:12.474 --> 32:15.143
I knew that this was
how I get her back.

32:15.185 --> 32:17.437
Who are you
to take this from us?

32:17.479 --> 32:19.647
This is saving my wife.

32:19.689 --> 32:21.566
This is saving
our lives together.

32:21.608 --> 32:23.485
Everybody you bring
in your circle,

32:23.526 --> 32:25.153
you're putting
their lives in danger.

32:25.862 --> 32:29.074
It's not right.
We should be born old

32:29.115 --> 32:31.743
and live our lives backwards,
because just when you start

32:31.785 --> 32:34.371
to appreciate your life,
it is gone.

32:34.412 --> 32:36.331
You don't see that.

32:36.373 --> 32:38.500
You're too young.

32:39.209 --> 32:41.795
One day,
you're gonna understand.

32:43.088 --> 32:45.965
We should have more time.

32:46.007 --> 32:48.718
Everyone should have
more time.

32:49.803 --> 32:53.431
Find peace in the fact
that you'll be able
to offer her comfort

32:53.473 --> 32:56.101
in the remaining time
she has left.

32:56.142 --> 32:59.354
TOM: We're real close.
They're here somewhere.

33:03.650 --> 33:06.820
FINOLA: He's smart.
He relayed the walkies.

33:22.836 --> 33:25.630
We have to stop, Kurt.

33:25.672 --> 33:27.382
I can't.

33:30.010 --> 33:32.387
I can't live without you.

33:32.429 --> 33:35.306
This gift was given to us.

33:38.059 --> 33:40.603
We already had our gift.

33:46.151 --> 33:48.570
A life with each other.

33:53.408 --> 33:55.994
We are like starlight.

33:57.370 --> 33:59.873
We were here...

33:59.914 --> 34:02.000
we've burned bright...

34:02.709 --> 34:05.420
even though that star
might not be here anymore.

34:09.090 --> 34:11.009
I'm afraid that--

34:12.260 --> 34:15.263
I'm afraid that
if you go back,

34:15.305 --> 34:17.849
you're gonna die
in that state.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.937
That you're not gonna
remember to wait for me.

34:24.481 --> 34:27.692
**

34:34.991 --> 34:37.744
(phone vibrates)

34:44.668 --> 34:47.295
TARKOLOV:
She has it with her.

34:50.006 --> 34:51.633
I wanted to use Irina.

34:51.675 --> 34:53.927
To make sure
it's someone you know.

34:55.345 --> 34:57.430
(knock on door)

35:13.113 --> 35:14.364
Where's the rest of it?

35:14.406 --> 35:16.449
It's enough
to show we have it.

35:16.491 --> 35:18.785
This is what
I was told to bring.

35:20.286 --> 35:22.497
MADDOX:
Let's see it.

35:31.589 --> 35:32.924
MADDOX: Is it charged?

35:32.966 --> 35:34.009
Mm-hmm.

35:34.050 --> 35:35.719
Turn it on.

35:35.760 --> 35:37.595
Let's send a team here,
and a team here.

35:37.637 --> 35:38.972
We'll close in on them.

35:39.014 --> 35:40.473
He won't be able
to get out of range.

35:40.515 --> 35:42.434
KURT: Hello?

35:42.475 --> 35:44.477
-Kurt?
-We're coming in.

35:44.519 --> 35:46.521
Tell Caspian and Subash
not to worry.

35:46.563 --> 35:48.273
Where are you?

35:48.314 --> 35:50.025
A small clearing,
past the incline.

35:50.066 --> 35:52.318
We'll be there, waiting.

35:52.360 --> 35:53.653
There.

35:53.695 --> 35:55.989
We have a hazmat
team right here.

35:56.031 --> 35:59.576
**

36:01.369 --> 36:03.121
(instrument warbling)

36:04.372 --> 36:08.418
Laghari is reading 210.
They should be right here.

36:08.460 --> 36:10.712
-Bryan.
-Yeah, I'm here.

36:10.754 --> 36:13.131
The Debris is here,
but they aren't.

36:13.173 --> 36:15.425
FINOLA: They know
what will happen to them.

36:18.345 --> 36:20.013
Kurt?

36:22.057 --> 36:24.976
Kurt, come back.
We can help you.

36:25.018 --> 36:26.770
* I *

36:26.811 --> 36:28.229
Kurt?

36:29.397 --> 36:32.150
* Thought I could
touch the stars *

36:33.943 --> 36:37.530
* I lie awake at night *

36:38.740 --> 36:41.951
* I wonder where you are *

36:43.828 --> 36:45.872
* My face explodes *

36:45.914 --> 36:50.043
* Teardrops into tears, yeah *

36:52.420 --> 36:55.423
* And every second
I'm not with you *

36:55.465 --> 36:58.385
* Well, it seems like years *

36:58.426 --> 37:00.553
* Seems like years *

37:02.889 --> 37:05.934
* And I've told you *

37:07.936 --> 37:10.438
* Well, I warned you *

37:12.816 --> 37:15.568
* That I loved you *

37:15.610 --> 37:18.738
* Yeah *

37:19.489 --> 37:20.657
* Yeah *

37:20.699 --> 37:23.660
**

37:38.299 --> 37:40.093
* I won't die *

37:42.637 --> 37:45.765
* But I won't feel the same *

37:47.559 --> 37:50.770
* I spend up all of my time *

37:52.105 --> 37:55.150
* Hoping to see you again *

37:57.485 --> 37:59.487
* My face explodes *

37:59.529 --> 38:03.575
* Teardrops into tears, yeah *

38:06.036 --> 38:08.872
* And every second
I'm not with you *

38:08.913 --> 38:11.791
* Well, it seems like years *

38:11.833 --> 38:14.252
* Seems like years *

38:16.713 --> 38:19.174
* Yeah, I warned you *

38:21.051 --> 38:23.762
* That I'd kill you *

38:25.847 --> 38:28.516
* 'Cause I loved you *

38:29.142 --> 38:31.811
* Yeah *

38:37.567 --> 38:39.235
Do you have it?

38:40.236 --> 38:41.571
Yes.

38:42.447 --> 38:46.910
We're going to take you
and Caspian to a facility

38:46.951 --> 38:49.829
where there are people
who can help you.

38:51.206 --> 38:54.542
Do you understand
what I'm telling you?

38:55.502 --> 38:57.337
I grow old again?

38:57.379 --> 38:58.713
Yes.

39:00.006 --> 39:01.758
You can't take it away.

39:01.800 --> 39:04.010
We just don't have
a choice, Subash.

39:04.052 --> 39:07.138
You can't take away
what it gave me.

39:08.807 --> 39:11.851
The miracle of life.

39:11.893 --> 39:14.020
I just needed
to feel it again.

39:14.062 --> 39:17.440
And after this,
I'm going to fight

39:17.482 --> 39:20.276
for every last day.

39:27.242 --> 39:29.536
I happen to know
you have stronger Debris

39:29.577 --> 39:31.996
that can access
communication frequencies.

39:32.038 --> 39:33.581
Why would you want this one?

39:33.623 --> 39:35.333
Because it works.

39:36.960 --> 39:39.879
Is that the only reason?

39:39.921 --> 39:43.800
Because this trade,
this method,

39:43.842 --> 39:46.136
Tarkolov,
it's unusual for you.

39:47.137 --> 39:49.097
I'm good.

39:50.056 --> 39:52.851
I hope you know
what you're doing.

39:53.852 --> 39:56.271
You always worry too much.

40:03.903 --> 40:06.239
(door closes)

40:12.579 --> 40:14.789
You can.

40:18.626 --> 40:20.503
Trust me.

40:21.463 --> 40:24.758
I know it wasn't easy going
against your orders.

40:24.799 --> 40:27.218
I appreciate that you did that.

40:28.428 --> 40:32.807
Ferris told me to tell you
that my father was in Greece,

40:32.849 --> 40:35.977
and I have no idea why.

40:36.019 --> 40:40.148
It's like she's leaving
just enough bread crumbs

40:40.190 --> 40:42.901
for Maddox to
figure something out.

40:43.818 --> 40:46.905
-Do you know what that is?
-No.

40:46.946 --> 40:49.449
But it was important
enough for her to do it.

40:49.491 --> 40:52.952
She's using me to figure
something out about my father.

40:52.994 --> 40:55.413
I have a bad feeling about it.

40:56.498 --> 40:59.167
I can't trust Ferris.

41:01.086 --> 41:03.088
And you can't trust Maddox.

41:04.381 --> 41:07.967
FINOLA: MI6 suspects
that he's been working
against the coalition,

41:08.009 --> 41:09.928
most likely the Chinese.

41:12.347 --> 41:14.474
You're wrong.

41:14.516 --> 41:16.726
I'm giving you
the information that I have...

41:16.768 --> 41:18.061
You don't know what
you're saying.

41:18.103 --> 41:22.649
This man... saved my life.

41:23.316 --> 41:25.735
The only thing
that I know for sure

41:25.777 --> 41:29.656
is that something
is going on that both of us
don't even understand.

41:29.698 --> 41:31.408
We need to trust each other.

41:31.449 --> 41:34.911
That is the only way we're
going to find our answers.

41:34.953 --> 41:37.914
Is there anything
that I need to know?

41:40.041 --> 41:41.710
Is there anything--

41:41.751 --> 41:44.212
They're surveilling
your apartment.

41:51.803 --> 41:53.722
(elevator dings)

41:53.763 --> 41:56.057
(phone rings)

41:58.101 --> 41:59.728
-(elevator dings)
-What's up?

41:59.769 --> 42:01.146
We've traced the calls

42:01.187 --> 42:02.856
that came in
on Anson Ash's phone.

42:02.897 --> 42:05.817
It's from a cell phone
in Maine.

42:05.859 --> 42:07.777
Stay on it.

42:07.819 --> 42:09.779
I want a name.

42:10.613 --> 42:12.157
(elevator dings)

42:27.797 --> 42:29.674
