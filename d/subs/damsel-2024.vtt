00:21.958 --> 00:24.875
<i>There are many stories of chivalry</i>

00:24.958 --> 00:28.291
<i>where the heroic knight
saves the damsel in distress.</i>

00:29.958 --> 00:32.958
<i>This is not one of them.</i>

01:05.666 --> 01:07.041
There it is.

01:07.833 --> 01:09.291
Form up!

01:11.625 --> 01:13.375
Let's kill the beast.

01:13.458 --> 01:15.875
For glory! Hyah!

01:30.458 --> 01:31.333
Be on guard.

02:12.333 --> 02:13.250
Form the line!

02:44.958 --> 02:45.791
Hold!

03:45.375 --> 03:46.750
The last I could find.

03:47.333 --> 03:49.916
Did you take the tapestries
into town like Father asked?

03:50.000 --> 03:51.333
This morning.

03:51.416 --> 03:54.541
We should take the furs too,
and the drapes.

03:54.625 --> 03:55.541
Not the drapes!

03:55.625 --> 03:57.916
You hate that pattern in your room anyway.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.625
They serve a purpose.

03:59.708 --> 04:02.541
Floria, our people are freezing.

04:02.625 --> 04:03.541
And starving.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.791
Who'd come this far north?

04:20.000 --> 04:22.125
Elodie, why are they leaving?

04:22.208 --> 04:24.333
There's nothing left
for them here, Floria.

04:28.791 --> 04:30.875
I don't have enough.
Please, I'm hungry.

04:30.958 --> 04:32.416
For food, join the line!

04:32.500 --> 04:34.541
-  Keep to one side.
-  I'm starving.

04:35.083 --> 04:36.000
All right then.

04:37.333 --> 04:38.708
Get off! It's mine!

04:38.791 --> 04:41.833
- Hey! Give me back my food.
- Get off of me, old man!

04:41.916 --> 04:43.000
You've had enough!

04:43.083 --> 04:45.291
Share this
with your sister. Go on.

04:45.375 --> 04:47.750
- Could you see who it was?
-  A stranger, my lady.

04:47.833 --> 04:50.083
They may take
whatever wood they can carry.

04:50.166 --> 04:51.625
- I'll see to it.
- Come on, Flor.

04:51.708 --> 04:53.125
-  Move on.
-  Yes.

04:53.208 --> 04:54.666
-  Get in line.
- Give it to me.

04:55.333 --> 04:57.666
-  I want to meet her first.
- Father?

05:01.875 --> 05:03.250
You must be Elodie.

05:03.833 --> 05:04.833
I am.

05:18.875 --> 05:19.833
She will do.

05:26.208 --> 05:29.541
-  We await your decision.
- Thank you, Your Holiness.

05:31.333 --> 05:32.333
Please, this way.

05:35.500 --> 05:37.250
Father, what's happening?

05:38.333 --> 05:39.291
Who is that?

05:42.166 --> 05:43.000
Stepmother?

05:45.708 --> 05:46.750
Well, what is it?

05:47.500 --> 05:49.291
From the Queen of Aurea.

05:53.125 --> 05:54.125
A proposal.

05:54.208 --> 05:56.250
- Oh, my goodness.
-  Huh...

05:57.333 --> 05:59.500
- I have made a match.
- May I?

05:59.583 --> 06:00.791
Uh-huh.

06:01.958 --> 06:03.041
He is a prince.

06:03.875 --> 06:04.791
A prince?

06:06.000 --> 06:08.875
I know you've always wished to travel,
as did your mother.

06:09.666 --> 06:12.125
Go. See the world.

06:12.208 --> 06:16.291
This man, he has a fleet of ships,
carriages full of gold.

06:16.875 --> 06:18.666
That's no reason to marry.

06:19.833 --> 06:21.041
We need this.

06:22.083 --> 06:23.916
Our stores are empty.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.041
We will not make it to the thaw.

06:28.208 --> 06:29.583
Your people need you.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.208
Hey.

06:34.916 --> 06:36.208
This is who we are.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.000
Get to the port side.

06:50.625 --> 06:51.791
Port side.

06:57.166 --> 06:59.625
Elodie, what's the matter?

07:00.541 --> 07:01.541
Nothing.

07:04.750 --> 07:06.416
Father says it's natural to be nervous

07:06.500 --> 07:08.666
about meeting
your new husband and his family.

07:09.583 --> 07:10.791
They're strangers.

07:11.375 --> 07:15.000
I've never heard of the Kingdom of Aurea
until Father sprang this on me.

07:15.083 --> 07:16.250
Mind the lines.

07:16.791 --> 07:17.666
Oh!

07:18.875 --> 07:22.333
Are you crazy?
What are you two doing up there?

07:22.916 --> 07:24.041
Come down here.

07:25.041 --> 07:26.166
Come on.

07:30.291 --> 07:32.833
This is how you
want your prince to meet you?

07:32.916 --> 07:34.958
Scared, cold as a corpse.

07:35.041 --> 07:37.208
Nose all drippy and wet.

07:37.291 --> 07:40.666
What have I been
telling you this entire trip?

07:41.166 --> 07:43.583
-  First impressions are everything.
- Hmm.

07:43.666 --> 07:45.000
Come on, lift up.

07:52.916 --> 07:54.125
Look at that.

08:06.666 --> 08:08.750
I have good news, girls.

08:08.833 --> 08:12.083
The captain informs me
we approach Aurea's coastline.

08:13.291 --> 08:15.083
It should be any time now.

08:25.041 --> 08:26.291
Father.

08:29.083 --> 08:30.875
What in the world?

08:33.541 --> 08:36.291
Looks almost... almost like a--

08:36.375 --> 08:37.458
A dragon.

09:07.125 --> 09:09.291
- It's okay.

09:48.666 --> 09:51.708
Oh, my heavens.

10:35.791 --> 10:36.958
It's magnificent.

10:37.708 --> 10:40.500
My lords, my ladies,

10:40.583 --> 10:43.125
be welcome to the Kingdom of Aurea.

10:43.666 --> 10:45.958
The royal family is at prayer,

10:46.041 --> 10:48.208
but word has been sent of your arrival.

10:48.291 --> 10:51.041
In the meantime,
your rooms have been made ready.

10:51.666 --> 10:53.000
If you will follow me.

10:55.208 --> 10:56.333
 Is this a dream?

10:57.250 --> 11:00.291
If so, can I move in and never wake up?

11:01.916 --> 11:04.916
If you want these people
to think we belong here,

11:05.000 --> 11:08.166
you can't act so easily impressed.

11:08.666 --> 11:11.000
What do you think, Ellie? Hmm?

11:11.083 --> 11:14.083
I think I had
a rather limited definition of wealthy.

11:35.416 --> 11:38.458
I pray this is to your liking, my lady.

11:39.541 --> 11:41.125
A bath has been drawn

11:41.916 --> 11:43.916
and supper has been carried hence.

11:45.791 --> 11:48.541
At first light,
I shall return to convey you

11:49.083 --> 11:50.666
to meet His Royal Highness.

11:51.250 --> 11:53.250
Henry, Prince of Aurea.

11:55.250 --> 11:57.458
Floria,
stop touching everything.

12:00.583 --> 12:01.791
Is something wrong?

12:02.708 --> 12:05.250
- I just hope he's kind.
- Hmm.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.500
- And well-read.
- Yeah.

12:07.083 --> 12:08.083
Handsome.

12:10.541 --> 12:13.333
Let's all give Elodie some privacy.

12:13.416 --> 12:16.708
She can use the time
to settle in, as we all could.

12:16.791 --> 12:18.000
Oh, indeed.

12:18.916 --> 12:19.875
Come.

13:15.250 --> 13:16.375
M'lady.

13:17.291 --> 13:18.666
Everyone's waiting.

14:31.500 --> 14:32.500
Ellie?

14:35.166 --> 14:36.625
I can't sleep.

14:41.875 --> 14:44.375
I still can't believe
you're going to live here from now on.

14:45.208 --> 14:46.416
You and me both.

14:47.708 --> 14:50.125
I keep thinking,
if only Mother were alive,

14:51.208 --> 14:53.583
I could just
talk to her about all of this.

14:55.291 --> 14:57.166
Perhaps you could talk to Stepmother.

14:58.083 --> 15:01.333
She means well, even if she is a bit...

15:01.416 --> 15:04.125
- Exhausting?

15:06.333 --> 15:09.333
It'll be fine. You'll see.

15:10.750 --> 15:13.375
You're Elodie. You can do anything.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.458
<i>What is your greatest strength?</i>

15:20.041 --> 15:22.000
I always tell the truth,
Your Majesty.

15:22.708 --> 15:25.708
Some might call that a weakness.

15:26.875 --> 15:28.166
Do you know your heart?

15:28.916 --> 15:30.833
I believe I do, Your Majesty.

15:30.916 --> 15:33.041
And what is it telling you now?

15:33.125 --> 15:37.125
In truth, it is beating too loudly for me
to hear much of anything, Your Majesty.

15:38.166 --> 15:39.625
Arise, Elodie.

15:47.916 --> 15:49.000
I'm Henry.

15:50.416 --> 15:52.416
Very pleased to finally meet you, my lady.

15:53.416 --> 15:54.291
We all are.

15:55.708 --> 15:58.041
My son understates our joy.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.125
And if I may say so,

16:00.708 --> 16:03.291
your father has understated your beauty.

16:03.875 --> 16:07.500
I've never known my father to understate
much of anything, Your Majesty.

16:07.583 --> 16:09.666
I see she arrives
with some wit.

16:09.750 --> 16:13.083
Should you want it or not, Your Majesty.

16:13.166 --> 16:14.625
And you must be Floria.

16:16.416 --> 16:19.666
It seems even a harsh clime
can grow the fairest flowers.

16:19.750 --> 16:21.583
I love your castle.

16:21.666 --> 16:24.041
I mean, I <i>really</i> love it.

16:24.125 --> 16:24.958
Like, a lot...

16:27.041 --> 16:27.875
Your Majesty.

16:28.458 --> 16:30.458
You are to make yourself at home, child.

16:30.541 --> 16:35.208
We elders have some trivial matters
like weddings to attend to.

16:35.291 --> 16:36.208
Yes...

16:36.875 --> 16:40.291
Your correspondence
made mention of some particulars

16:40.375 --> 16:42.416
you wish to discuss in person.

16:42.916 --> 16:45.333
- The two of us can confer in private.
- Yes.

16:45.416 --> 16:47.625
It's nothing to bore
our young people with.

16:48.916 --> 16:50.958
They have a far more
important task at hand.

16:52.125 --> 16:53.958
They must get to know each other.

17:07.125 --> 17:09.125
Do you have any questions of me?

17:10.791 --> 17:12.375
Questions of what subject?

17:12.958 --> 17:14.458
You may choose the subject.

17:17.333 --> 17:18.708
What do you think about me?

17:20.208 --> 17:21.208
Pardon?

17:22.333 --> 17:25.625
Well, you seem disinterested at best,
which is your prerogative,

17:25.708 --> 17:28.416
but I'd like to know if the person
I'm being guilted into marrying

17:28.500 --> 17:29.875
truly likes me or not.

17:32.583 --> 17:35.541
If my attitude offends you,
I do apologize. It was not my intent.

17:38.833 --> 17:43.750
However, I was unaware that, um,
you were being guilted into anything.

17:46.041 --> 17:49.916
The land where I come from
is exactly how your mother explained.

17:51.000 --> 17:53.125
Harsh and barren.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.083
This union will save us.

17:56.166 --> 17:57.708
I've made my peace with it.

17:58.583 --> 18:02.000
My happiness is a small price to pay
for the future of my people.

18:05.791 --> 18:06.750
Is something wrong?

18:09.375 --> 18:10.375
It's just...

18:11.875 --> 18:15.750
In the letter you sent in advance
of your arrival, you sounded different.

18:15.833 --> 18:18.541
Different. In what way?

18:19.500 --> 18:20.625
Far more, um...

18:22.791 --> 18:23.791
flowery.

18:25.583 --> 18:29.458
Maybe that's because
my stepmother dictated most of it

18:29.541 --> 18:32.958
and my sister's idea was the heart...

18:33.666 --> 18:35.458
- The heart.
- Mmm.

18:35.541 --> 18:38.041
I thought it was
some sort of provincial insignia.

18:41.458 --> 18:42.708
You actually drew this?

18:46.333 --> 18:48.083
Hold on. It's a maze, isn't it?

18:48.166 --> 18:50.041
"I hope you'll get to know my heart."

18:50.125 --> 18:51.625
That is very clever.

18:53.583 --> 18:56.125
I used to make them
for Floria when she was little.

18:57.083 --> 18:59.583
- May I ask you another question?
- Certainly.

19:00.458 --> 19:02.333
Do they always follow you so closely?

19:04.625 --> 19:06.208
This is them giving me space.

19:07.833 --> 19:08.875
That must be tiring.

19:09.875 --> 19:11.458
It is, actually.

19:13.916 --> 19:17.541
I saw some horses
being left unattended at the stables.

19:21.458 --> 19:22.333
Do you ride?

19:39.583 --> 19:40.583
Hyah!

19:52.291 --> 19:55.416
- Where did you learn to ride like that?
- My mother.

19:56.625 --> 19:58.125
Which way now?

19:58.208 --> 20:00.291
Well, depends on what you want to see.

20:01.250 --> 20:02.250
Everything.

20:03.375 --> 20:04.583
Very well.

20:20.375 --> 20:21.750
What happened in there?

20:23.958 --> 20:24.833
Speak already.

20:25.750 --> 20:28.166
- Is the wedding still on?
- Aye.

20:28.875 --> 20:31.583
You settled on a fair bride price?

20:31.666 --> 20:34.125
More gold than I could ever imagine.

20:38.625 --> 20:40.291
Then why do you look so?

20:40.375 --> 20:41.958
No, it's nothing. I'm fine.

20:43.958 --> 20:46.500
Tell me, you didn't say anything
to embarrass us.

20:46.583 --> 20:48.041
No, I did not.

20:48.125 --> 20:51.958
Because it's very important
that our two families get along.

20:52.041 --> 20:54.250
Not only for Elodie's sake, but for ours.

20:54.333 --> 20:56.875
I said, nothing! Nothing's wrong.

21:00.833 --> 21:04.333
I saw something,
high on the mountain last night.

21:04.958 --> 21:05.958
Torches.

21:07.875 --> 21:09.166
You saw that?

21:09.250 --> 21:10.416
I couldn't sleep.

21:12.708 --> 21:14.125
It was an ancient ceremony.

21:15.041 --> 21:17.000
Or rather, one of three.

21:17.625 --> 21:19.541
They're very significant to my family.

21:20.166 --> 21:22.250
For our whole kingdom, really. They, um...

21:23.916 --> 21:25.625
They honor our ancestors.

21:27.625 --> 21:30.333
That's why my mother
chose these dates for our wedding.

21:31.291 --> 21:32.708
It is quite beautiful.

21:33.625 --> 21:34.833
Yes, I suppose.

21:35.916 --> 21:38.416
I really don't have
anything else to compare it to.

21:39.458 --> 21:41.125
May I confide in you something?

21:42.083 --> 21:43.041
Yes.

21:43.125 --> 21:45.791
My greatest wish is to go see the world.

21:47.375 --> 21:50.583
Really set out and see it, you know?

21:51.250 --> 21:52.375
I do, actually.

21:53.583 --> 21:54.833
It's my life's dream.

21:57.333 --> 22:01.708
For as long as I can remember,
I've longed to explore the distant lands.

22:02.541 --> 22:04.208
The ones you only read about.

22:08.291 --> 22:10.166
Perhaps, one day, we will.

22:12.208 --> 22:13.291
Perhaps.

22:27.375 --> 22:29.458
And the orange in this area.

22:33.125 --> 22:36.000
Everything's so beautiful, Your Majesty.

22:36.083 --> 22:37.666
Well, I'm glad you approve.

22:38.750 --> 22:40.125
Very elegant.

22:42.541 --> 22:44.750
You have impeccable taste.

22:45.750 --> 22:49.333
Everything is just so exquisite.

22:49.416 --> 22:52.166
I'm sorry, is there something
I can help you with?

22:52.833 --> 22:55.750
I just thought
we might become better acquainted,

22:56.458 --> 22:58.708
seeing as we're about to be family.

22:58.791 --> 23:02.333
Ah, this must be very exciting for you.

23:02.416 --> 23:05.416
Your father was a rope maker, was he not?

23:05.500 --> 23:07.208
The finest in the city.

23:07.291 --> 23:09.958
And here you are. You've climbed so high.

23:11.041 --> 23:14.000
Still, one mustn't forget one's station.

23:14.916 --> 23:16.875
Nor place undue import

23:16.958 --> 23:20.708
on what is ultimately
a transaction born of necessity.

23:21.791 --> 23:24.000
Uh... "Necessity"?

23:24.583 --> 23:26.208
Well, your family needs money.

23:26.875 --> 23:28.458
My family needs a bride.

23:29.166 --> 23:31.791
What we don't need is more family.

23:33.291 --> 23:35.583
I wish all the best for Henry and Eloise.

23:35.666 --> 23:37.000
- I merely--
- Elodie.

23:37.500 --> 23:38.333
Pardon?

23:40.291 --> 23:43.416
My stepdaughter. Her name is Elodie.

23:44.916 --> 23:46.000
That's what I said.

23:46.958 --> 23:48.291
Good day, Lady Bayford.

24:05.416 --> 24:06.250
It's perfect.

24:07.166 --> 24:08.833
Everything in here is so perfect.

24:13.125 --> 24:14.125
Stepmother.

24:15.875 --> 24:17.250
Is something the matter?

24:18.708 --> 24:19.666
Elodie,

24:20.750 --> 24:23.041
I know we haven't always been close,

24:23.750 --> 24:25.791
but I need you to listen to me now.

24:26.541 --> 24:29.625
This wedding... is a mistake.

24:29.708 --> 24:30.708
What?

24:33.125 --> 24:34.458
I don't understand.

24:34.541 --> 24:36.958
These people, I don't trust them.

24:37.541 --> 24:41.041
It's hard to explain,
but a mother knows these things.

24:41.125 --> 24:43.250
Only yesterday,
you were enamored by this place.

24:43.333 --> 24:44.291
Floria.

24:44.375 --> 24:45.458
I was wrong.

24:46.625 --> 24:50.750
They may be royalty,
but that doesn't make them good people.

24:52.166 --> 24:53.000
Well...

24:54.125 --> 24:57.208
- What does Father think?
- He refuses to talk about it.

24:57.291 --> 25:01.458
And when I try to tell him my worries,
he snaps at me.

25:01.541 --> 25:04.250
- Because you're being unreasonable.
- That's enough, Flor.

25:04.833 --> 25:10.000
Elodie, I swear that I only want
what's best for you.

25:15.291 --> 25:17.000
Am I interrupting something?

25:18.708 --> 25:19.750
No.

25:20.666 --> 25:21.500
Just...

25:23.958 --> 25:25.000
girl talk.

25:26.166 --> 25:30.416
Well, tomorrow's a big day,
and these girls, they need their rest.

25:33.208 --> 25:36.125
Think about what I said.
There's still time.

25:36.708 --> 25:37.541
Time for what?

25:44.625 --> 25:47.041
I hope you know
what you're doing.

25:52.500 --> 25:53.916
Good night, my angels.

25:55.000 --> 25:56.708
- Good night, Father.
- Good night, Father.

25:58.916 --> 25:59.833
Good night.

27:34.208 --> 27:35.041
Wow.

28:10.916 --> 28:12.583
You may kiss the bride.

28:29.500 --> 28:33.458
I present my son and new daughter,
Elodie, Princess of Aurea.

28:57.833 --> 28:59.166
Goodbye, Father.

29:22.125 --> 29:24.833
I hope I'm half as beautiful
someday as you are today.

29:26.833 --> 29:28.250
Twice as beautiful.

29:31.041 --> 29:33.291
- I love you.
- I love you.

29:49.208 --> 29:53.750
Hey! Hey, hey!

29:57.875 --> 29:59.125
Where are we going?

29:59.208 --> 30:02.416
Remember I told you about those
ancient ceremonies up on the mountain?

30:02.500 --> 30:03.333
Yes.

30:03.416 --> 30:06.333
We're going to pay homage
to my ancestors.

31:00.000 --> 31:01.666
Welcome, Princess.

31:02.541 --> 31:06.083
For generations,
it has been our task, our duty,

31:06.958 --> 31:08.500
to protect our people.

31:09.750 --> 31:13.083
The price is dear, but so too the reward.

31:14.291 --> 31:15.458
So, tonight,

31:16.833 --> 31:22.041
you join a long line of women
who have helped to build this kingdom.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.958
When our ancestors
first lay claim to this island,

31:29.750 --> 31:32.208
they found they were not
its sole inhabitants.

31:33.166 --> 31:35.458
A creature dwelt here first.

31:36.416 --> 31:38.083
The last of its kind.

31:39.208 --> 31:41.208
With savage bloodlust,

31:41.291 --> 31:44.750
the beast left its lair
and set upon the village.

31:46.041 --> 31:50.166
So the king gathered his soldiers
to avenge his people.

31:50.916 --> 31:53.375
But their steel
was no match for the monster,

31:54.333 --> 31:56.791
and each man met his end.

31:57.875 --> 32:00.041
Each save one.

32:00.958 --> 32:05.500
For the king,
the beast had a far worse fate in store.

32:06.333 --> 32:10.166
Give up his three beloved daughters
and the island could be shared.

32:11.208 --> 32:12.625
A cruel torture.

32:13.583 --> 32:14.791
He adored his daughters,

32:16.375 --> 32:19.041
but his duty to his subjects was stronger.

32:20.083 --> 32:22.500
And so, a pact was made.

32:22.583 --> 32:25.958
The three princesses met their end
in the belly of the beast,

32:26.041 --> 32:27.625
and a kingdom was born.

32:35.333 --> 32:38.916
It is this sacrifice
we commemorate every generation.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.416
A tradition going back centuries.

32:52.666 --> 32:54.083
Your hand, child.

33:02.125 --> 33:07.708
A legacy of honor and duty
you now inherit, Princess Elodie of Aurea.

33:20.375 --> 33:24.458
Let our two lines mingle
and fast become one.

33:25.916 --> 33:28.375
She is now of royal blood.

33:40.458 --> 33:43.583
To ensure that our kingdom
thrives forevermore,

33:44.250 --> 33:45.791
pay your due to the realm.

33:48.291 --> 33:50.208
Toss the coin into the chasm.

34:02.875 --> 34:05.041
The ceremony is now complete.

34:07.250 --> 34:08.916
You may make your return.

34:12.708 --> 34:14.583
I'm supposed to carry you back.

34:14.666 --> 34:16.666
I'm fine with walking, really.

34:22.000 --> 34:23.875
Floria would love this part.

34:25.875 --> 34:26.916
Close your eyes.

34:28.083 --> 34:29.125
I've got you.

34:53.625 --> 34:54.458
I'm sorry.

35:01.458 --> 35:02.791
No!

36:03.041 --> 36:04.625
Help me!

36:20.666 --> 36:22.291
Help!

36:23.958 --> 36:25.500
Is anyone there?!

37:30.666 --> 37:32.000
That's not mine.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.666
I am the sacrifice.

37:37.000 --> 37:38.583
I am the sacrifice?

39:13.416 --> 39:14.708
You poor thing.

39:15.583 --> 39:17.041
What happened to you?

40:25.708 --> 40:27.500
Give me strength, Mother.

40:28.375 --> 40:29.708
Mother?

41:25.750 --> 41:29.125
Your name, little bird?

41:31.291 --> 41:33.333
Speak your name.

41:35.125 --> 41:36.208
Elodie.

41:36.833 --> 41:40.333
El-o-die.

41:41.791 --> 41:43.375
Exciting.

41:45.250 --> 41:46.416
What do you want?

41:49.916 --> 41:54.333
I want... what is promised.

41:57.000 --> 41:58.875
What is owed.

42:01.166 --> 42:07.041
Every generation, your kind must pay.

42:10.500 --> 42:11.750
My kind?

42:11.833 --> 42:15.166
The scent of royalty betrays you.

42:16.208 --> 42:18.250
It's in your blood.

42:33.125 --> 42:38.625
Now, my favorite part.

42:41.625 --> 42:44.375
- Run.

44:10.833 --> 44:12.875
Did I hurt you?

44:17.958 --> 44:19.458
Quiet now?

44:20.750 --> 44:23.458
A clever one.

44:24.625 --> 44:27.541
The last one was over so quick.

45:02.875 --> 45:04.041
No.

45:29.083 --> 45:30.958
Mother wanted you to fight.

47:47.083 --> 47:49.875
No. No.

49:01.500 --> 49:03.041
<i>He is a prince.</i>

49:04.791 --> 49:06.958
<i>They must
get to know each other.</i>

49:10.375 --> 49:12.791
<i>My greatest wish
is to go see the world.</i>

49:14.208 --> 49:15.791
<i>Perhaps, one day we will.</i>

50:18.041 --> 50:19.000
One for the dress.

51:03.458 --> 51:04.500
Don't worry.

51:05.958 --> 51:07.291
I won't hurt you.

53:29.541 --> 53:32.458
Almost caught you, little bird.

53:36.833 --> 53:41.666
You hide now, like all the others.

53:50.458 --> 53:52.833
It makes no difference.

53:54.750 --> 53:59.291
This story always ends the same.

54:33.125 --> 54:33.958
V.

54:35.833 --> 54:37.208
Victoria.

54:40.791 --> 54:41.750
Beatrice.

54:42.833 --> 54:43.708
Artemis.

54:44.666 --> 54:45.666
Genevive.

54:46.625 --> 54:47.500
Fatima.

54:48.583 --> 54:49.708
Carlotta.

54:53.250 --> 54:54.416
How many?

54:59.583 --> 55:01.125
Did anyone make it out?

56:01.625 --> 56:03.625
Please, don't.

56:04.458 --> 56:05.583
Somebody...

56:47.166 --> 56:48.041
It's a lie.

57:02.916 --> 57:04.125
Get off.

57:50.666 --> 57:52.125
I'm deeply sorry...

57:54.041 --> 57:55.833
for underestimating you.

58:00.458 --> 58:01.625
A map.

58:04.083 --> 58:06.541
Now, where am I?

58:09.125 --> 58:10.083
A tree.

58:11.875 --> 58:13.083
<i>The entrance cave.</i>

58:16.250 --> 58:20.666
Following down into the bird cave.

58:24.416 --> 58:25.791
Through the twisted tunnel...

58:28.125 --> 58:29.625
reaching water.

58:31.125 --> 58:33.208
<i>The glowworm cave.</i>

58:34.541 --> 58:35.875
Keep following down.

58:38.041 --> 58:39.416
I am here.

58:42.125 --> 58:43.416
How do I escape?

58:47.791 --> 58:48.708
Is this it?

58:50.083 --> 58:51.958
Did a princess make it out?

58:56.833 --> 58:59.666
Three ways. Take the middle fork.

59:00.750 --> 59:01.791
Music note.

59:03.166 --> 59:04.291
Crystals.

59:06.666 --> 59:07.791
Go on.

59:08.625 --> 59:12.041
And then... I am free.

59:27.250 --> 59:28.541
The middle fork.

01:00:05.375 --> 01:00:06.375
Music.

01:00:36.416 --> 01:00:37.583
Crystals.

01:00:51.375 --> 01:00:52.458
This is it.

01:01:06.166 --> 01:01:07.291
Wish me luck.

01:01:19.750 --> 01:01:21.041
You made it out.

01:02:47.375 --> 01:02:48.583
No!

01:03:01.708 --> 01:03:04.541
Elodie.

01:03:06.583 --> 01:03:09.166
Fly, little bird.

01:05:08.958 --> 01:05:09.958
Hello.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:13.125
Hello!

01:05:15.416 --> 01:05:18.541
I'm here! Help!

01:05:20.125 --> 01:05:21.791
Help!

01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.500
Hello!

01:05:32.166 --> 01:05:35.916
There is no way out, Princess.

01:05:37.208 --> 01:05:39.583
Not for any of you.

01:05:42.166 --> 01:05:43.875
Three were taken.

01:05:44.625 --> 01:05:47.375
Three must be given.

01:05:53.333 --> 01:05:54.708
Elodie!

01:05:56.916 --> 01:05:58.166
What's this?

01:06:09.166 --> 01:06:10.875
Elodie!

01:06:22.791 --> 01:06:24.166
Elodie!

01:06:31.083 --> 01:06:32.000
Move on.

01:06:35.041 --> 01:06:37.916
I've done what you paid for, milord.
I'll just wait up top.

01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.666
You'll do no such thing.

01:06:41.041 --> 01:06:42.916
I hired you to guide us to her.

01:06:44.041 --> 01:06:47.333
No one leaves here without my daughter.

01:06:59.875 --> 01:07:01.666
Elodie!

01:07:03.416 --> 01:07:04.875
Elodie!

01:07:41.250 --> 01:07:43.708
<i>A creature dwelt here first.</i>

01:07:45.875 --> 01:07:47.500
<i>The last of its kind.</i>

01:07:49.708 --> 01:07:50.958
It's a lie.

01:07:55.666 --> 01:07:56.791
Three taken.

01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:17.083
Slay the vile young.

01:08:35.333 --> 01:08:36.625
Form the line!

01:08:52.791 --> 01:08:55.041
Please, spare me.

01:08:56.458 --> 01:08:57.875
Show mercy.

01:09:00.416 --> 01:09:02.083
I will give you anything.

01:09:06.708 --> 01:09:10.291
Death is not enough for you.

01:09:10.375 --> 01:09:13.125
You will know my pain.

01:09:18.041 --> 01:09:19.625
Elodie!

01:09:23.666 --> 01:09:25.000
Elodie!

01:09:38.375 --> 01:09:40.208
Elodie!

01:09:44.333 --> 01:09:45.916
Elodie!

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.916
Be quiet. She can hear you.

01:09:50.625 --> 01:09:54.000
I warned you. It's too late.
The beast lurks in its lair.

01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:58.333
- It's surely taken her there to devour--
- This lair. Where is it?

01:09:58.416 --> 01:10:01.041
Sir, your daughter's been
down here nigh on too long.

01:10:01.666 --> 01:10:03.208
She's almost certainly been killed.

01:10:04.541 --> 01:10:05.916
Elodie!

01:10:08.541 --> 01:10:11.041
I'm told some have tried
to hunt the beast.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:13.333
For its blood.

01:10:14.666 --> 01:10:15.791
Nonsense.

01:11:18.208 --> 01:11:20.958
Why are you here?

01:11:21.708 --> 01:11:23.750
I'm here for my daughter.

01:11:25.208 --> 01:11:26.125
Father.

01:12:06.458 --> 01:12:08.750
Father.

01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:10.708
Please.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:13.250
I beg of you.

01:12:23.208 --> 01:12:27.500
It's not my mercy that you should seek.

01:12:28.708 --> 01:12:30.250
Call her.

01:12:31.208 --> 01:12:32.291
She's alive?

01:12:33.208 --> 01:12:34.750
Elodie's still alive?

01:12:35.541 --> 01:12:36.958
I smell her.

01:12:38.791 --> 01:12:40.041
Hiding.

01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:42.916
Watching.

01:12:52.208 --> 01:12:54.083
Call her.

01:12:55.083 --> 01:12:55.916
No.

01:12:57.708 --> 01:12:59.208
Call her.

01:13:04.458 --> 01:13:05.291
Elodie.

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:08.791
Can you hear me?

01:13:14.166 --> 01:13:19.041
I have... I have made a horrible,
horrible mistake.

01:13:20.875 --> 01:13:23.916
To sacrifice the one thing I love most.

01:13:24.791 --> 01:13:27.125
To trade your life

01:13:28.666 --> 01:13:30.458
for the good of my people.

01:13:32.125 --> 01:13:34.416
I thought that I could take the gold.

01:13:37.083 --> 01:13:38.750
That I could live with myself.

01:13:40.458 --> 01:13:41.416
My choice.

01:13:45.333 --> 01:13:46.416
But I can't.

01:13:48.625 --> 01:13:49.583
I can't.

01:13:57.791 --> 01:14:00.041
Tell her to come to you.

01:14:05.583 --> 01:14:07.750
Last chance.

01:14:11.916 --> 01:14:15.250
Elodie. Hear me.

01:14:16.958 --> 01:14:20.208
I am your father. You will obey me.

01:14:21.875 --> 01:14:23.166
I order you.

01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:26.083
Do not come out!

01:14:29.708 --> 01:14:30.541
No.

01:14:36.791 --> 01:14:37.666
No!

01:15:32.625 --> 01:15:33.791
Ellie.

01:15:39.791 --> 01:15:40.958
Use the ropes.

01:15:41.041 --> 01:15:42.708
Your stepmother and Floria,

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:46.625
they wait for you at the ship.

01:15:49.916 --> 01:15:51.333
Forgive me.

01:17:44.541 --> 01:17:46.000
Go! Go! Go!

01:18:04.750 --> 01:18:05.958
Go.

01:18:42.541 --> 01:18:46.041
That damn girl. I knew she was trouble.

01:18:47.875 --> 01:18:49.625
- Where are you going?
- To fix this.

01:19:23.666 --> 01:19:25.958
-  Stop.
-  Stand back.

01:19:34.458 --> 01:19:35.291
Elodie.

01:19:38.541 --> 01:19:39.500
Open up!

01:19:39.583 --> 01:19:41.333
- Get out of the way!

01:19:43.958 --> 01:19:45.000
Get out!

01:19:51.041 --> 01:19:51.958
Seize her.

01:19:52.041 --> 01:19:53.291
You can't!

01:19:53.375 --> 01:19:55.166
- No! She's just a child!
-  No!

01:19:55.250 --> 01:19:56.791
You promised us a daughter.

01:19:56.875 --> 01:19:59.083
- Stepmother!
- No!

01:19:59.166 --> 01:20:00.583
Floria!

01:20:56.208 --> 01:20:57.041
Elodie.

01:21:02.083 --> 01:21:03.000
Stepmother.

01:21:06.666 --> 01:21:08.291
- Elodie.
- Stepmother.

01:21:08.375 --> 01:21:09.750
Oh!

01:21:09.833 --> 01:21:11.000
Thank God.

01:21:11.083 --> 01:21:12.541
Are you all right?

01:21:12.625 --> 01:21:13.583
I can manage.

01:21:15.083 --> 01:21:15.958
Where's Floria?

01:21:16.041 --> 01:21:18.875
They took her to the caves in your place.

01:21:18.958 --> 01:21:21.000
I tried to stop them
from taking your sister.

01:21:21.083 --> 01:21:22.291
I have to save her.

01:21:22.375 --> 01:21:24.875
No, I'll go. I can find her.

01:21:24.958 --> 01:21:26.083
It may be too late.

01:21:27.041 --> 01:21:27.958
No.

01:21:28.458 --> 01:21:30.166
Not if I can help it.

01:21:31.666 --> 01:21:32.541
Your father...

01:21:36.541 --> 01:21:37.791
Go.

01:21:44.166 --> 01:21:47.333
Please. Let me go!

01:21:47.416 --> 01:21:49.541
Please let me go.

01:21:51.416 --> 01:21:52.250
No, don't do this.

01:21:52.333 --> 01:21:54.625
Mother, enough! She's too young.

01:21:54.708 --> 01:21:58.833
A prince protects his kingdom,
without hesitation or complaint.

01:21:58.916 --> 01:21:59.958
Give me your hand.

01:22:00.041 --> 01:22:03.083
I cannot do this. She's just a child.

01:22:03.666 --> 01:22:05.791
You're weak.

01:22:05.875 --> 01:22:09.416
No! Please don't do this to me!

01:22:14.833 --> 01:22:16.625
Get off of me!

01:22:17.208 --> 01:22:18.916
Let go! Off of me!

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.166
Throw her in.

01:22:44.958 --> 01:22:46.166
Floria!

01:22:46.833 --> 01:22:48.541
Floria!

01:22:50.166 --> 01:22:51.916
Floria!

01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:44.791
I'm coming for you, Flor.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:47.708
My little ones...

01:24:50.375 --> 01:24:52.333
They did not let you live.

01:24:54.666 --> 01:24:57.958
Nor shall I let Elodie.

01:25:09.083 --> 01:25:12.583
Your sister will come for you.

01:25:28.875 --> 01:25:30.791
There she is now.

01:25:54.666 --> 01:25:56.791
Hello, Floria. Floria, can you hear me?

01:25:57.666 --> 01:25:58.583
Wake up!

01:25:58.666 --> 01:26:00.375
We need to hurry.

01:26:00.458 --> 01:26:01.500
Floria!

01:26:02.166 --> 01:26:03.000
Ellie.

01:26:06.041 --> 01:26:07.500
Elodie, you're alive.

01:26:08.583 --> 01:26:10.958
Okay. I'm going to get you out of here.

01:26:15.708 --> 01:26:18.208
My leg. I hurt it when I fell.

01:26:19.666 --> 01:26:21.125
We don't have time, Flor.

01:26:31.750 --> 01:26:33.708
No, no, no. Not yet.

01:26:33.791 --> 01:26:34.833
What now?

01:26:34.916 --> 01:26:36.333
You have to hide quickly.

01:26:36.416 --> 01:26:37.583
What about you?

01:26:37.666 --> 01:26:39.125
I must tell her the truth.

01:26:39.208 --> 01:26:40.083
Come on.

01:26:56.416 --> 01:26:59.125
Where are you hiding?

01:27:03.333 --> 01:27:04.541
Dragon.

01:27:09.375 --> 01:27:11.166
That won't kill me,

01:27:12.250 --> 01:27:14.625
but it will make me angry.

01:27:14.708 --> 01:27:15.958
Good.

01:27:16.583 --> 01:27:18.625
I'm angry too.

01:27:23.333 --> 01:27:25.041
We have both been lied to.

01:27:25.708 --> 01:27:27.625
They said you set upon their village.

01:27:27.708 --> 01:27:30.041
That the king came
only to defend his people.

01:27:30.750 --> 01:27:33.708
He came unprovoked.

01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:36.291
I know what they did.

01:27:37.041 --> 01:27:38.500
I know they killed your children.

01:27:39.083 --> 01:27:41.583
"They"? You!

01:27:41.666 --> 01:27:44.125
Your kind, your blood.

01:27:44.208 --> 01:27:45.041
No!

01:27:45.125 --> 01:27:48.875
My daughters were the last of my line.

01:27:48.958 --> 01:27:53.083
So, I will take their daughters
until my final breath.

01:27:53.791 --> 01:27:57.000
Except you haven't.
We are not their daughters.

01:27:57.083 --> 01:27:58.750
More lies.

01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:37.625
Ellie!

01:28:52.041 --> 01:28:56.791
Now, you will know my daughters' pain.

01:29:44.250 --> 01:29:46.500
I am not one of them!

01:29:51.625 --> 01:29:53.916
I smell it in your blood.

01:31:19.833 --> 01:31:23.416
El-o-die.

01:31:25.666 --> 01:31:28.041
Accept your fate...

01:31:34.000 --> 01:31:36.000
as I have mine.

01:31:40.083 --> 01:31:43.708
We are to die alone.

01:31:51.041 --> 01:31:52.333
No.

01:31:55.916 --> 01:31:57.875
I have an army with me.

01:32:00.541 --> 01:32:04.416
Every innocent woman
whose life was stolen down here.

01:32:06.708 --> 01:32:10.958
Your kind were never innocent.

01:32:18.125 --> 01:32:19.375
Then go ahead.

01:32:23.583 --> 01:32:25.208
Show me your fire.

01:32:30.125 --> 01:32:30.958
Well?

01:32:32.291 --> 01:32:33.750
What are you waiting for?

01:32:36.875 --> 01:32:37.958
Burn me.

01:32:40.583 --> 01:32:41.625
Burn me!

01:33:45.583 --> 01:33:47.208
My sister had this too.

01:33:48.625 --> 01:33:49.750
All of us did.

01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:52.875
That is how they make us royal.

01:33:54.250 --> 01:33:56.458
That is the blood you smell.

01:34:06.958 --> 01:34:08.125
They fooled you.

01:34:10.125 --> 01:34:13.458
You've been killing
innocent daughters just like they did.

01:34:21.541 --> 01:34:24.541
Then, end it.

01:34:51.041 --> 01:34:51.875
No.

01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:59.000
I'm through doing what I'm told.

01:36:19.041 --> 01:36:19.875
Elodie.

01:36:26.708 --> 01:36:29.541
You must believe me.
I haven't slept a moment since--

01:36:29.625 --> 01:36:31.458
Since you tried to kill my sister?

01:36:32.958 --> 01:36:33.958
I had no choice.

01:36:34.041 --> 01:36:37.000
Don't you dare explain yourself to this...

01:36:37.083 --> 01:36:38.666
this commoner.

01:36:42.916 --> 01:36:44.583
Is she to be the third?

01:36:45.541 --> 01:36:47.041
Princess number three.

01:36:48.791 --> 01:36:52.250
She's the last,
and then I'll be free to marry whoever I--

01:36:52.333 --> 01:36:54.000
That's enough, Henry.

01:36:54.958 --> 01:36:57.375
You know nothing of what we've endured.

01:36:58.041 --> 01:37:00.291
You know nothing of our story.

01:37:08.625 --> 01:37:10.000
Take your family

01:37:11.833 --> 01:37:13.166
and run.

01:37:15.208 --> 01:37:16.541
Come. Let's go.

01:37:18.375 --> 01:37:21.833
I will offer you all
one last chance to do the same.

01:37:29.333 --> 01:37:30.166
No?

01:37:32.250 --> 01:37:34.750
You insolent creature.

01:37:35.791 --> 01:37:37.541
You think we ought to fear you now?

01:37:38.958 --> 01:37:39.791
Why?

01:37:40.541 --> 01:37:43.750
Because you somehow
managed to escape the dragon?

01:37:47.541 --> 01:37:49.708
It's not me you should fear.

01:37:50.958 --> 01:37:54.291
This is the end of your story.

01:37:55.375 --> 01:37:56.375
Run!

01:38:10.750 --> 01:38:13.416
-  It's the dragon!
-  Run!

01:38:36.125 --> 01:38:42.833
No!

01:39:28.958 --> 01:39:31.125
Someone give me a hand
with this barrel.

01:39:31.208 --> 01:39:32.875
Let's be sharp there, lads.

01:39:32.958 --> 01:39:35.125
You can't be serious.

01:39:35.208 --> 01:39:36.083
But I am.

01:39:36.166 --> 01:39:37.916
We'll run it together.

01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:39.583
We've got a bounty of supplies.

01:39:39.666 --> 01:39:42.041
Enough to get us through
this freeze and the next.

01:39:42.125 --> 01:39:43.166
Oh, Elodie.

01:39:43.250 --> 01:39:46.458
You're the only person I trust
to look after our people, Mother.

01:39:55.333 --> 01:39:56.500
Can I help too?

01:39:59.791 --> 01:40:00.625
Floria.

01:40:01.166 --> 01:40:02.791
I'm counting on it.

01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.541
Stepmother.
Stepmother, come and see this.

01:40:14.625 --> 01:40:16.208
Oh, wide heavens!

01:40:16.291 --> 01:40:19.458
My lady,
what course shall we steer?

01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:22.750
Home.
