out of my mother.

56:54.870 --> 56:57.956
Used to do it to her, used to do it to me.

57:01.376 --> 57:03.003
When my brother was born, it got worse.

57:03.629 --> 57:06.048

the shit kicked out of her,

57:06.131 --> 57:08.175

57:28.779 --> 57:30.572
And do what? Go gunnin' for cops?

57:30.656 --> 57:31.907
They're dirty cops.
