WEBVTT

00:02.753 --> 00:05.129
We cannot divulge
specifics, but what we can tell you

00:05.130 --> 00:08.300
is that we are preparing
for a massive catastrophe

00:09.134 --> 00:11.135
that could cause an extinction-level event
for humanity

00:11.136 --> 00:13.387
in the very near, very real future.

00:17.100 --> 00:20.020
Listen, I know this all
sounds pretty far-fetched.

00:20.771 --> 00:23.231
But you know when it
won't seem far-fetched?

00:23.232 --> 00:25.525
In less than a decade, when a tsunami

00:25.526 --> 00:28.820
plunges the entire eastern seaboard
of the United States underwater.

00:29.905 --> 00:31.197
Marsha, you wanna come in here?

00:31.198 --> 00:33.699
Xavier's gonna take me on a little walk.

00:33.700 --> 00:36.077
The minute Versailles
is called, you record the speech,

00:36.078 --> 00:38.579
we're escorted down, wait for confirmation

00:38.580 --> 00:41.582
of the safest route
to Joint Base Andrews, then we're out.

00:41.583 --> 00:44.336
Collins, I think it's time you put
your foot down with your wife.

00:44.962 --> 00:48.590
Trips to Atlanta are not as risk-free
as they used to be.

00:49.174 --> 00:52.009
My wife hasn't listened to me
for 20 years, sir.

00:52.010 --> 00:54.554
I guess we'll just have
to go pick her up from there.

00:55.514 --> 00:56.515
Don't go.

00:57.516 --> 00:58.642
I love you, baby.

01:02.521 --> 01:04.022
See you in 10 days.

01:06.441 --> 01:08.569
Your wife is alive out there, Xavier.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.572
And if you stop all this nonsense...

01:13.323 --> 01:14.700
I can help you find her.

01:21.582 --> 01:24.710
 <i>And now, Bill Roberts
reporting from the United Nations.</i>

01:25.794 --> 01:28.588
 <i>The curtain goes up
in what is hoped to be the final act</i>

01:28.589 --> 01:33.009
<i>of the nearly two-week-long drama
that is the Cuban Missile Crisis.</i>

01:33.010 --> 01:34.719
<i>Today, Ambassador Adlai Stevenson</i>

01:34.720 --> 01:36.972
<i>addressed the United Nations
Security Council.</i>

01:37.848 --> 01:40.891
 <i>This resolution calls
as an interim measure</i>

01:40.892 --> 01:45.187
<i>under Article 40 of the charter
for the immediate dismantling</i>

01:45.188 --> 01:50.067
<i>and withdrawal from Cuba of all missile
and other offensive weapons.</i>

01:50.068 --> 01:53.237
<i>Leaders around the world
rejoiced as a peaceful solution...</i>

02:00.120 --> 02:01.371
I didn't know you'd come home.

02:01.872 --> 02:03.998
We got intelligence an hour ago.

02:03.999 --> 02:07.836
The Soviet sub that was loaded with nukes
was out of contact with Moscow.

02:09.588 --> 02:11.297
The one that turned around?

02:11.298 --> 02:14.760
Apparently, its last orders
were to launch all missiles if cornered.

02:15.844 --> 02:19.806
The captain made the decision not to,
on his own.

02:20.932 --> 02:22.017
Jesus.

02:29.524 --> 02:33.320
It's gonna happen again, Miriam.
It's goddamn inevitable.

02:40.327 --> 02:43.080
What if the wrong person's
at the controls next time?

02:45.207 --> 02:47.834
What if the wrong person
decides not to turn around?

02:50.045 --> 02:51.254
You're tired.

02:53.048 --> 02:54.174
Come to bed.

02:58.470 --> 03:01.223
You can't save the world tonight.

03:04.726 --> 03:07.062
Okay. Okay.

03:54.776 --> 03:55.777
Didn't you hear what I said?

03:57.988 --> 03:59.865
- Your wife is alive.
- Bullshit.

04:00.824 --> 04:01.824
I'm not playing your games.

04:01.825 --> 04:04.286
- It's not bullshit, Agent Collins.
- Everything was destroyed.

04:05.370 --> 04:06.620
It's a nuclear winter out there.

04:06.621 --> 04:09.040
Which is exactly
what we thought, initially.

04:10.041 --> 04:12.669
The expedition,
the four that didn't return.

04:15.088 --> 04:16.714
They didn't die
because of the environment.

04:16.715 --> 04:20.135
They died because they were bringing
a survivor back to the bunker.

04:21.178 --> 04:24.472
Which I ordered them
not to do, by the way.

04:24.473 --> 04:26.056
And it was gonna open
a whole can of worms,

04:26.057 --> 04:27.476
and so I had to take care of them.

04:29.060 --> 04:31.563
My God, could I sound
any more like a Bond villain?

04:32.981 --> 04:34.899
I swear I'm not a monster.

04:34.900 --> 04:38.236
Interesting how people who swear
they aren't monsters usually are.

04:46.161 --> 04:48.746
The expedition set up
shortwave transmitters

04:48.747 --> 04:51.082
so that we could communicate
while they were outside.

04:52.542 --> 04:54.794
Transmitters are still active,
and I've been listening.

04:54.795 --> 04:57.004
<i>My name is Cameron Middleton</i>

04:57.005 --> 04:58.798
<i>of Zanesville, Ohio.</i>

04:58.799 --> 05:01.592
<i>If Carla or Joseph Middleton
are listening,</i>

05:01.593 --> 05:04.053
<i>please tell them I'm headed
for the Colorado Bunker Com--</i>

05:05.764 --> 05:08.098
<i>Looking for safe passages to Colorado.</i>

05:08.099 --> 05:11.101
<i>Western Kansas is irradiated.</i>

05:11.102 --> 05:13.729
<i>Forming a community south of Paso Robles.</i>

05:13.730 --> 05:15.981
<i>If you're listening, several members
plan to set up camp there.</i>

05:18.276 --> 05:19.486
People are alive.

05:22.197 --> 05:24.950
And they're looking for us,
and I believe your wife is one of them.

05:28.245 --> 05:31.205
Don't... Don't you fucking dare.

05:31.206 --> 05:34.626
She was in Atlanta, it was a direct hit.
It was unsurvivable.

05:36.127 --> 05:38.212
The president did something that day,
Agent Collins.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.632
- Something you don't know about.
- Not true, I was with him.

05:41.132 --> 05:44.051
I was with him that whole
fucking horrible day.

05:44.052 --> 05:46.763
- You don't know everything that happened.
- I was there!

05:49.182 --> 05:50.267
I was there.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.686
[on TV] <i>This is our
continuing coverage of the situation</i>

06:58.209 --> 06:59.835
<i>Nationwide cell phone

06:59.836 --> 07:01.003

- Hm?

<i>...as networks are overrun...</i>

07:02.714 --> 07:04.757
Are you guys here because of this?

07:04.758 --> 07:07.259
Why are you two stationed
outside the cabinet room door?

07:07.260 --> 07:09.553
Don't ask me, ma'am.
This is my third day here.

07:09.554 --> 07:12.681
Uh, is this not normal, sir?

07:12.682 --> 07:16.060
Marsha, we're just doing what we're told.
I have no additional information.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.896
-  That's Melbourne?
-  <i>The death toll</i>

07:18.897 --> 07:20.689
<i>-is expected to be in the hundreds...
- Nancy's family lives there.</i>

07:20.690 --> 07:22.608
<i>Ashbridge Preparatory.</i>

07:22.609 --> 07:24.401
Can you give me 20 seconds?

07:24.402 --> 07:27.196
Hi, Denise, this is Xavier Collins again.
I'm just calling to reiterate--

07:27.197 --> 07:29.198
-  <i>We're a little busy, Xavier.
- No, I know. I know.</i>

07:29.199 --> 07:32.660
But how important it is that James
and Presley stay near Jeremy Bradford.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.871
-  <i>You told me this before.
- I know. I'm sorry.</i>

07:35.872 --> 07:37.498
But someone will be coming to get them.

07:37.499 --> 07:39.750
You know, actually, if you could just
give them their phones so I could talk.

07:39.751 --> 07:42.337
- Calls keep dropping.
-  <i>Goodbye, Mr. Collins.</i>

07:43.129 --> 07:44.421
Fuck!

07:44.422 --> 07:46.423
<i>And what is especially alarming...</i>

07:46.424 --> 07:47.966
- Xavier, talk to me.
- Hm.

07:47.967 --> 07:49.843
What do you know?
The cabinet gathered

07:49.844 --> 07:53.639
like there's some kind of plan in motion,
and I heard the word "Versailles."

07:53.640 --> 07:55.517
Marsha, I swear I would tell you.

07:56.434 --> 07:59.353
I mean, do I need to pick
Edward up from daycare?

07:59.354 --> 08:01.271
He's got health issues.

08:01.272 --> 08:02.564
Talk to him.

08:02.565 --> 08:05.694
The-- the president, I have been
with him since his Senate campaign.

08:06.736 --> 08:08.904
- Edward can't be left alone, okay?
- I will talk to him.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.489
I will tell you everything
that I find out.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.908
Out of the way. VP coming through.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.163
- Classified!
- Sorry, sir.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.582
Mr. Vice President,
I need a moment with the president

08:20.583 --> 08:22.376
- if you don't--
- You're kidding me.

08:22.377 --> 08:23.669
...communication with our--

08:23.670 --> 08:26.296
Russia's gone dark. Completely dark.

08:26.297 --> 08:29.007
Thank you, Henry, we know.
Why don't you have a seat?

08:29.008 --> 08:30.885
Take a breather, and maybe a Valium.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.722
Joint Chiefs were just
walking us through it.

08:34.723 --> 08:36.974
- General Curtleigh.
- Yes, sir.

08:36.975 --> 08:41.520
As the vice president noted,
Russia isn't picking up the red line.

08:41.521 --> 08:42.813
We're still trying to confirm

08:42.814 --> 08:45.107
if the Svoboda Group coup d'etat
was successful.

08:45.108 --> 08:48.445
- Indications are that it was.
- CIA can confirm that.

08:49.946 --> 08:51.780
We also have confirmations
of troop mobilization

08:51.781 --> 08:54.658
to the Chinese border
along the Argun and Amur Rivers

08:54.659 --> 08:56.201
and Western Mongolia.

08:56.202 --> 08:58.495
It feels like they're setting up
for a land grab, sir.

08:58.496 --> 09:02.166
And since we don't know all the players
except for the Svoboda Group leader--

09:02.167 --> 09:03.917
Cherkin. Unpredictable.

09:03.918 --> 09:05.754
- Ruthless.
- Which I was about to say.

09:07.297 --> 09:09.840
It is the recommendation
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

09:09.841 --> 09:11.633
that we move to DEFCON 3.

09:11.634 --> 09:14.596
This will set the Air Force
readiness envelope to 15 minutes.

09:15.346 --> 09:17.639
Christ. Okay, anything else?

09:17.640 --> 09:20.350
The UN Security Council
is convening in two hours.

09:20.351 --> 09:21.977
NATO countries have been reaching out.

09:21.978 --> 09:24.355
Two hours. We lose Florida in two hours!

09:25.023 --> 09:27.525
I've said that before,
but it was about the electoral college.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.111
Okay.

09:31.488 --> 09:32.906
I mean, how bad is it?

09:33.907 --> 09:35.282
I wanna know. I mean, I know it's bad.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.160
But honestly, is this it? Is it?

09:38.161 --> 09:39.536
Half the world leaders we're talking to

09:39.537 --> 09:41.205
say it's the end of the world,
the others don't.

09:41.206 --> 09:44.041
The Tories in England
say the volcano's too far away

09:44.042 --> 09:46.251
for them to be affected by it,
and they live on a fucking island.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.879
It will most certainly affect them, sir.

09:48.880 --> 09:52.591
This appears to be it, Mr. President.
It's what we've been preparing for.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.927
What about Australia?
Anyone on the horn with Melbourne?

09:54.928 --> 09:56.221
I can't get anything.

09:57.388 --> 10:00.141
Melbourne is gone. Sorry, Henry.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.269
Nancy's entire family.

10:03.978 --> 10:06.606
As is Sydney. All coastal cities.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.982
New Zealand, gone.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.985
Argentina, apart from
the mountain regions, effectively gone.

10:11.986 --> 10:14.822
Chile, South Africa. Need I go on?

10:16.366 --> 10:18.326
- We need to make the call.
- Okay, where are my nerds?

10:19.327 --> 10:21.703
Scientists, come on, step to.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.331
You said we'd have warning!

10:24.916 --> 10:26.708
Days or weeks, if this was the real thing.

10:26.709 --> 10:28.085
What the fuck happened?

10:28.086 --> 10:30.796
Mr. President,
we thought we'd have warning,

10:30.797 --> 10:32.756
but this happened faster
than the worst-case scenario

10:32.757 --> 10:34.550
- in all of our modeling.
-  Bunch of bullshit.

10:34.551 --> 10:36.927
- Come on.
- We calculated that there'd be 10 days

10:36.928 --> 10:38.595
from first seismic activity to eruption,

10:38.596 --> 10:40.597
but we had minutes.

10:40.598 --> 10:43.016
-  Sir!
- We are not making the wrong call here.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.733
Move us to DEFCON 3.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.402
Around the horn,
go or no go for Versailles.

10:53.403 --> 10:54.903
-  Joint Chiefs.
-  Go.

10:54.904 --> 10:56.321
-  Homeland Security.
-  Go.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.365
Jesus Christ, we know our fucking titles,
just give me your answers.

10:58.366 --> 11:05.455
Go.

11:08.877 --> 11:09.961
Okay.

11:11.087 --> 11:12.380
I'm calling Versailles.

-  Yes, Mr. President.
- Sir, can I have a minute?

11:47.332 --> 11:49.167
It's a go for Versailles.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.171
Ryan, on me.

11:53.922 --> 11:57.217

12:09.979 --> 12:13.190
Boss, what the hell is Versailles?
Is there anything I need to do?

12:13.191 --> 12:16.568
Your job as briefed.
I'm on Wildcat, you're on me.

12:16.569 --> 12:18.487
- Mr. President.
- Gotta get this tie off me.

12:18.488 --> 12:20.405
It's too fucking cheerful.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.741
-  <i>Hi, this is Dr. Teri--
- You know, I once read that neckties</i>

12:22.742 --> 12:25.619
date back to Serbian mercenaries
in the 1600s or some shit.

12:25.620 --> 12:27.497
Just do your job. Alright?
See if you can find...

12:31.834 --> 12:35.421
Okay, let's go blue.
It's a little more calming.

12:40.551 --> 12:42.470
Alright, steps, what's next?
Walk me through it.

12:44.013 --> 12:47.349
You record the speech,
uh, we move down to PEOC.

12:47.350 --> 12:49.977
And when it's time, board Marine One
to Joint Base Andrews.

12:49.978 --> 12:52.521
- After that, I don't know.
- Are we going somewhere?

12:52.522 --> 12:54.649
- Sir, if I may, I just need a word.
- Okay.

13:00.530 --> 13:02.572
<i>We now take it
to our colleague Rebecca</i>

13:02.573 --> 13:06.285
<i>in Jakarta right now, where the wave
is due to hit at any moment.</i>

13:06.286 --> 13:08.328
<i>- Is that correct?
- That is correct, Bob.</i>

13:08.329 --> 13:10.372
<i>What you can't see is the water line,</i>

13:10.373 --> 13:12.374
<i>which is just beyond the city lights,</i>

13:12.375 --> 13:15.335
<i>has receded well over
three miles out to sea.</i>

13:15.336 --> 13:17.546
<i>You think that's a safe place
for you to be?</i>

13:17.547 --> 13:19.131
<i>We're on top of a 20-story building</i>

13:19.132 --> 13:20.882
<i>on the north shore of the island,
so we should--</i>

13:22.427 --> 13:24.261
-  <i>Oh, my God.
-  Oh, wow.</i>

13:24.262 --> 13:26.430
-  <i>You okay?
-  Oh!</i>

13:26.431 --> 13:28.307
<i>I don't know if you can hear that.</i>

13:28.308 --> 13:31.852
<i>We just got hit with a massive
high-pressure sound wave</i>

13:31.853 --> 13:35.564
<i>that has been preceding the tsunami
and wreaking havoc with air traffic</i>

13:35.565 --> 13:37.441
<i>throughout the southern hemisphere.</i>

13:38.818 --> 13:43.156
<i>It's quite painful, and...</i>

13:45.158 --> 13:46.242
<i>What?</i>

13:48.870 --> 13:49.953
What's going on?

13:49.954 --> 13:52.123
<i>What is that?</i>

13:52.832 --> 13:55.083
<i>Oh, my God!
Get away from the edge!</i>

13:55.084 --> 13:58.170
<i>Get away from...</i>

14:01.591 --> 14:03.508
<i>Did we just-- did we just lose her?</i>

14:03.509 --> 14:05.511
-  My God.
-  <i>We lost Rebecca.</i>

14:07.889 --> 14:09.306
<i>Can we get back to her?</i>

14:09.307 --> 14:11.349
<i>Can we get back to her?</i>

14:11.350 --> 14:13.268
- What's happening?
-  <i>Daddy, what's going on?</i>

14:13.269 --> 14:14.936
<i>They're moving a few of us
to another room.</i>

14:14.937 --> 14:16.354
<i>I think the president's kid.</i>

14:16.355 --> 14:17.731
Good. Is James with you?

14:17.732 --> 14:18.899
-  <i>Yeah.
- Good.</i>

14:18.900 --> 14:20.734
He is not to leave your sight,
do you understand me?

14:20.735 --> 14:22.027
- This is not a game.
-  <i>Okay.</i>

14:22.028 --> 14:23.111
You do not let go of his hand,

14:23.112 --> 14:25.489
and you do not lose sight
of Jeremy Bradford, promise me.

14:25.490 --> 14:27.784
<i>I promise. Where's Mom?</i>

14:28.451 --> 14:31.078
- I'm working on that.
<i>-  Daddy, people are freaking out.</i>

14:31.079 --> 14:33.288
<i>Mrs. Johnson fell in the stairs,
and I don't think she's okay.</i>

14:33.289 --> 14:36.041
Hey, listen to me. There's a plan.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.293
You're gonna be fine,
they're gonna take you to an airport,

14:38.294 --> 14:40.378
I'll see you there. So will Mom, okay?

14:40.379 --> 14:43.131
Shit.

14:43.132 --> 14:44.300
A plan?

14:45.051 --> 14:46.301
What airport? What do you know?

14:46.302 --> 14:48.261
- Have you talked to Cal?
- A little.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.472
- More soon, okay? Ryan!
- Xavier.

14:50.473 --> 14:51.932
Ryan!

14:51.933 --> 14:53.768
-  Xavier?
- Head in the game, man.

14:54.852 --> 14:55.936
Guard the door.

14:55.937 --> 14:58.147
[on TV] <i>The scale of this case
is much greater--</i>

14:58.856 --> 15:00.816
"Remain calm,
'cause the tsunami moves fast,

15:00.817 --> 15:02.109
but fear moves faster."

15:02.110 --> 15:03.276
Okay.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.945
I mean, isn't this a little optimistic?

15:04.946 --> 15:06.446
It's important to keep the calm.

15:06.447 --> 15:09.116
This reads like we're prepping people
for a goddamn snowstorm.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.742
- When does this go out?
- Recording won't air

15:10.743 --> 15:12.702
until after we evacuate to Andrews.

15:12.703 --> 15:14.955
I'll lead the press corps
to believe it's broadcasting live

15:14.956 --> 15:17.207
- when we play it back.
- Yeah, I don't know, guys.

15:17.208 --> 15:20.336
It's important we keep to the plan.
Keep people calm.

15:21.462 --> 15:22.504
Okay.

15:22.505 --> 15:24.589
Lose the "strength and resilience,"
repeat to the end.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.051
- That pays off the whole structure.
- Riley, really? Today?

15:29.220 --> 15:30.512
- Fine.
- Okay. Come on.

15:30.513 --> 15:32.305
How fast can you turn
around the changes?

15:32.306 --> 15:33.766
Did you see that fucking wave?

15:35.351 --> 15:36.643
My family?

15:36.644 --> 15:38.436
About to load up to Andrews as we speak.

15:38.437 --> 15:39.522
Yeah. Okay.

15:40.982 --> 15:41.982
Everyone!

15:41.983 --> 15:44.861
- People!
- I'd like the room, please.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.071
Sir, we're on a timetable.

15:47.530 --> 15:49.239
I'll be ready to record in two.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.449
Alright, folks, that's a real two minutes.

15:56.581 --> 15:58.206
"Remain calm, top priority at this time,

15:58.207 --> 16:00.293
"ensure public safety...

16:01.919 --> 16:03.254
Bullshit.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.553
Shoes off, please.

16:11.679 --> 16:13.513
- Sir.
- That's the first thing I ever said to you

16:13.514 --> 16:17.642
when we met right here in this office,
and you did it.

16:17.643 --> 16:19.228
It was so cute.

16:25.860 --> 16:27.570
Drink?

16:29.488 --> 16:31.615
It's like a reenactment of that day.

16:31.616 --> 16:33.451
Sir, Teri is still in Atlanta.

16:35.494 --> 16:36.953
- They had her on the first flight out...
- Jesus.

16:36.954 --> 16:39.748
...but the FAA grounded everything,
which I just found out

16:39.749 --> 16:42.375
because the cell phone towers are overrun.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.252
Calls are dropping, not getting through,

16:44.253 --> 16:46.796
so I didn't know
for like the last 10 minutes.

16:46.797 --> 16:49.257
- Xavier, calm down.
- And now, she's stuck there.

16:49.258 --> 16:51.927
And, um, you said that you were
gonna get her a plane.

16:51.928 --> 16:53.804
Agent Collins, calm down.

16:54.472 --> 16:55.847
Where are your kids?

16:55.848 --> 16:57.766
At school. I think with your son.

16:57.767 --> 16:59.601
Okay, then they're right
where they need to be.

16:59.602 --> 17:01.561
They're gonna get picked up
with the other Versailles kids.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.480
- You're gonna see 'em on the plane, okay?
- Okay.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.106
And Teri?

17:07.944 --> 17:09.320
Alright, let's get this done!

17:13.741 --> 17:14.742
Just like magic.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.578
Talk to General Curtleigh.
He'll get her here.

17:18.579 --> 17:19.664
Thank you, sir.

17:28.005 --> 17:29.006
Oh shit.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.217
...just picked up over Chinese airspace?

17:32.218 --> 17:34.511
<i>Hi, this Dr. Teri Rogers-Collins--</i>

17:34.512 --> 17:37.098
- And that's smoke in the air, for sure?
- We're working on it.

17:37.682 --> 17:39.849
- We need confirmation now.
- General Curtleigh, sir.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.144
- A little busy.
- The president said I should talk to you.

17:46.315 --> 17:48.900
- Make it fast.
- My wife was on a plane that was grounded.

17:48.901 --> 17:51.027
The president said
that you could get her here,

17:51.028 --> 17:53.405
- and I'm certainly hoping it's possible--
- Facts only. Where?

17:53.406 --> 17:55.240
Atlanta airport.

17:55.241 --> 17:57.242
- She's on the list for Versailles?
- Yes, sir.

17:57.243 --> 17:58.411
Dobbins ARB.

18:00.121 --> 18:01.454
- Go with him.
- Yes, sir, thank you.

18:01.455 --> 18:03.707
She needs to get
to Dobbins Air Reserve Base.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.584
It's 25 miles from Hartsfield-Jackson.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.544
- She have a car?
- I don't know.

18:07.545 --> 18:09.921
- Her name?
- Teri Rogers-Collins.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.340
She'll have gate clearance.

18:12.341 --> 18:15.010
The last transport is wheels-up,
one hour 15.

18:15.011 --> 18:16.469
- Get her there.
- Thank you, sir.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.597
I need you push
a clearance through at Dobbins.

18:18.598 --> 18:19.807
Settle.

18:22.310 --> 18:23.352
That's too long.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.818
Have Tompkins cover me
at the Oval door, now.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.824
- What do you need?
- You're on point, kid's on you.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.701
POTUS is recording. I'm back in five.

18:39.702 --> 18:41.329
And recording.

18:42.413 --> 18:45.373
My fellow Americans,
as you are undoubtedly aware,

18:45.374 --> 18:48.127
a catastrophe has befallen
the southern hemisphere.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.755
And while the images from that part
of the world are unsettling,

18:51.756 --> 18:53.424
it's important we remain calm,

18:54.050 --> 18:58.012
because a tsunami moves fast,
but fear moves faster.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.347
This will be a challenging moment.

19:00.348 --> 19:03.475
We believe that the damage
from the weather event will be extensive.

19:06.729 --> 19:10.732
<i>Also suggesting
a bunker complex in the upper Alps.</i>

19:10.733 --> 19:13.360
<i>This is crazy, man.</i>

19:13.361 --> 19:16.446
<i>- Yeah, my sister got one last week...
- Garcia.</i>

19:16.447 --> 19:18.198
Can you believe this shit, X?

19:18.199 --> 19:19.824
And why'd you pull Tompkins? I need her.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.785
Give me the fastest route
to Dobbins Air Reserve Base

19:21.786 --> 19:23.411
- from Hartsfield-Jackson.
-  Fastest?

19:23.412 --> 19:25.373
- The roads are a wreck.
- It's for Teri, it's her only way out.

19:26.499 --> 19:27.583
On it.

19:38.803 --> 19:40.971
-  <i>Hi, this is Dr. Teri--
-  Boss.</i>

19:42.723 --> 19:44.140
- What you got?
- Tell her to take Route 6

19:44.141 --> 19:46.017
to Route 5 to Marietta,
stay off all freeways.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.268
Should take 45 minutes.

19:47.269 --> 19:49.646
- Good man.
- And send back Tompkins.

19:49.647 --> 19:51.731
- She's coordinating the choppers.
- Yeah.

19:51.732 --> 19:54.734
The United States has weathered
many great challenges in the past

19:54.735 --> 19:56.695
and has always come through stronger.

19:56.696 --> 19:58.072
This will be no exception.

19:59.323 --> 20:01.157
When the dust clears from this tragic day,

20:01.158 --> 20:04.869
we will go forward, as Americans,

20:04.870 --> 20:08.998
as a beacon of strength
in a sometimes dark world.

20:08.999 --> 20:11.377
Thank you, and God bless you all.

20:12.962 --> 20:13.963
Cut.

20:15.673 --> 20:17.341
Get this shit off of me.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.719
Alright, clear the room! Move it!

20:30.062 --> 20:31.563
Sir, we have confirmation

20:31.564 --> 20:33.565
of multiple interceptor clusters
laddering down

20:33.566 --> 20:35.233
across the Russo-Chinese border.

20:35.234 --> 20:37.361
Guys, I was an English Lit major.

20:38.446 --> 20:40.196
Russia and China exchanged fire,

20:40.197 --> 20:42.616
both air and ground
across multiple fronts.

20:43.617 --> 20:45.785
Intelligence also indicates both sides
are prepping nuclear action.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.162
This is not unexpected.

20:47.163 --> 20:52.001
As briefed, governments will begin
securing resources for what comes next.

20:55.504 --> 20:56.755
Okay.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.548
Tide rises, the tide falls.

20:58.549 --> 21:00.967
Yes, sir.
There have also been explosions

21:00.968 --> 21:02.552
at two air bases in Denmark,

21:02.553 --> 21:04.804
seemingly from inbound
conventional missiles.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.389
- From who?
- We don't know.

21:06.390 --> 21:09.893
But Denmark being NATO,
if they invoke Article 5...

21:09.894 --> 21:11.770
We recommend
moving to DEFCON 2, sir.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.522
And maybe speed up evac to Andrews.

21:15.065 --> 21:17.317
[on TV] <i>They've been
expecting seismic activity down there</i>

21:17.318 --> 21:19.569
<i>for well over two years.</i>

21:19.570 --> 21:22.155
<i>Thanks to our continued carbon emission.</i>

21:22.156 --> 21:25.158
<i>Oh, so now volcanoes are man-made too?</i>

21:25.159 --> 21:29.788
<i>Rising global temperatures
lessened ice mass over the Antarctic.</i>

21:29.789 --> 21:31.664
<i>We know from history,</i>

21:31.665 --> 21:35.376
<i>our actions allowed the cork to pop.</i>

21:35.377 --> 21:38.880
<i>So, yes, I would say
we played a fucking role.</i>

21:38.881 --> 21:41.007
<i>Alright, we can--
we can keep it clean.</i>

21:41.008 --> 21:42.509
<i>We don't need that kinda language.</i>

21:42.510 --> 21:44.677
<i>Oh, we don't need
that kinda language, Bob?</i>

21:44.678 --> 21:47.138
<i>...I'll wait for a real disaster</i>

21:47.139 --> 21:49.975

<i>You know, Mr. Markley...</i>

21:51.977 --> 21:54.771
<i>...your oil company checks
will be meaningless--</i>

21:54.772 --> 21:57.023
-  Teri.
-  <i>Thank God, I've been trying.</i>

21:57.024 --> 21:59.734
- Where are you?
-  <i>Outside the airport.</i>

21:59.735 --> 22:01.486
<i>- A bunch of us are walking.
- Listen to me, listen.</i>

22:01.487 --> 22:04.572
Um, you need to get
to Dobbins Air Reserve Base.

22:04.573 --> 22:07.033
-  <i>Okay, but I don't have--
- Just listen to me. Listen to me.</i>

22:07.034 --> 22:09.619
I sent you the map.
You take Route 6 till it meets Route 5,

22:09.620 --> 22:12.372
and take that to Marietta, right?
No freeways.

22:12.373 --> 22:14.666
They'll have your name at the gate,
and they'll fly you here.

22:14.667 --> 22:16.376
You have just over an hour.
It should be enough time.

22:16.377 --> 22:17.710
Repeat it back to me.

22:17.711 --> 22:20.630
<i>Route 6 to Route 5 to Marietta.
But-- but Xavier--</i>

22:20.631 --> 22:22.507
No, but no freeways.

22:22.508 --> 22:24.801
-  <i>I don't have a car.
- Steal one.</i>

22:24.802 --> 22:26.177
<i>Xavier, how am I...</i>

22:26.178 --> 22:27.679
- Ter--
-  <i>...bring you some breaking news</i>

22:27.680 --> 22:30.056
<i>in Los Angeles, a record...</i>

22:30.057 --> 22:33.017
<i>...and catastrophic
magnitude 8.9 earthquake</i>

22:33.018 --> 22:34.686
<i>has hit the sprawling metropolis.</i>

22:34.687 --> 22:38.606
<i>We are seeing some images
of destruction from the ground.</i>

22:38.607 --> 22:41.150
<i>I'm being told the I-10 freeway
has collapsed...</i>

22:41.151 --> 22:44.070
What the fuck is going on?
It's like the world's coming apart.

22:44.071 --> 22:45.989
- Back to the door.
-  <i>...ordered to evacuate</i>

22:45.990 --> 22:48.157
<i>just hours ago, are now stranded.</i>

22:48.158 --> 22:49.701
Back to Garcia, thanks.

22:49.702 --> 22:51.286
<i>We'll-- we'll try to provide updates</i>

22:51.287 --> 22:52.912
<i>- as this story develops.
- I need your help.</i>

22:52.913 --> 22:54.163
<i>Dr. Louge, this is an unprecedented...</i>

22:54.164 --> 22:56.749
Please.
I know the president is helping you,

22:56.750 --> 22:58.084
and I don't care about myself.

22:58.085 --> 23:00.920
I need you to save Edward.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.839
My sister is dropping him off
with his meds.

23:02.840 --> 23:04.340
- Get him to safety.
-  <i>Is there more to come?</i>

23:05.759 --> 23:07.677
-  <i>The real issue...
-  Promise me.</i>

23:07.678 --> 23:09.262
<i>...millions of tons of volcanic ash,</i>

23:09.263 --> 23:12.599
<i>still bursting into our stratosphere,
which will encircle the globe...</i>

23:12.600 --> 23:13.850
It's gonna be okay.

23:15.436 --> 23:17.395
<i>Now, that means no crops...
-  Thank you.</i>

23:17.396 --> 23:18.980
<i>...no food,</i>

23:18.981 --> 23:20.648
<i>never-ending winter.</i>

23:20.649 --> 23:22.943
-  <i>What happens then?
- I don't know.</i>

23:24.028 --> 23:26.362
<i>Why don't you ask a fucking dinosaur?</i>

23:39.084 --> 23:41.836
<i>Are we on, Bob? Is-- is it just me here?</i>

23:41.837 --> 23:43.755
<i>No, we're on. We're gonna remain on,</i>

23:43.756 --> 23:47.300
<i>as the decision really has been made
by the, the brave women and men</i>

23:47.301 --> 23:51.846
<i>in this newsroom to continue
our broadcast for as long as we can.</i>

23:51.847 --> 23:53.181
Clear a path.

23:53.182 --> 23:55.558
<i>Dr. Louge, you have
been researching this...</i>

23:55.559 --> 23:57.101
- Agent Xavier Collins?
- Yes, ma'am.

23:57.102 --> 23:59.020
Special Agent Robinson, in charge of evac.

23:59.021 --> 24:00.772
I'm Agent Ryan Noble. I'm new.

24:00.773 --> 24:03.399
Agent Collins, after you've escorted
the president to PEOC,

24:03.400 --> 24:05.693
the others will come down in shifts.
You'll await my orders

24:05.694 --> 24:07.613
to move to Marine One, understood?

24:09.281 --> 24:11.115
- Agent Collins, am I boring you?
- No, ma'am.

24:11.116 --> 24:14.494
Escort Wildcat to PEOC,
shifts, await orders. Understood.

24:14.495 --> 24:16.454
Uh, and what about me?

24:16.455 --> 24:19.291
- You'll stay here guarding the door.
-  Mr. President.

24:20.376 --> 24:21.543
This way.

24:25.255 --> 24:26.714
Wait.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.717
- Give me a second.
- Sir.

24:30.511 --> 24:31.886
Sir, we need to move, now.

24:31.887 --> 24:33.514
Ryan, Rainey, perimeter.

24:37.476 --> 24:38.769
Get him.

24:39.603 --> 24:41.563
- Mr. President, I need to get you to PEOC.
- Excuse me.

24:43.440 --> 24:45.316
It's Jeffrey, right?

24:45.317 --> 24:48.111
Mr. President, you know my name?

24:48.112 --> 24:50.655
Everyone knows your name.
You've been here for nine administrations.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.866
Can I ask what you're doing?

24:53.867 --> 24:56.411
Making my rounds as best I can.

24:56.412 --> 24:58.329
People been leaving kind of a mess today.

24:58.330 --> 25:00.248
I guess they're all distracted.

25:00.249 --> 25:01.500
And you're not?

25:03.335 --> 25:06.713
It looks bad,
but when you get to be my age...

25:06.714 --> 25:09.049
...you kind of seen it all before.

25:10.050 --> 25:13.929
Been here for 9/11, war, pandemics.

25:14.555 --> 25:17.599
- Things always go back to normal.
- Mr. President, I must insist.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.480
I think you should call your family.

25:24.732 --> 25:27.316
It's different this time.

25:27.317 --> 25:30.403
With all respect, sir,
I've heard that before.

25:30.404 --> 25:33.322
I'm seeing them
for my granddaughter's birthday tomorrow.

25:33.323 --> 25:34.783
I'll talk to 'em then.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.419
Thank you, sir.

25:51.717 --> 25:53.426
This is not right.

25:53.427 --> 25:55.178
This isn't right.
We gotta go back to the Oval.

25:55.179 --> 25:56.846
- That is not the plan.
- I don't give a shit about the plan.

25:56.847 --> 25:58.890
I want you to put me
on TV right now, live.

25:58.891 --> 26:00.184
What?

26:00.809 --> 26:02.143
Non-essentials, stay here!

26:02.144 --> 26:03.978
- Ryan, Rainey!
- Goddamn it!

26:03.979 --> 26:05.897
Agent Janusz, you, hold your positions.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.273
What do you plan to say, sir?

26:07.274 --> 26:08.524
I'm gonna be honest with them.

26:08.525 --> 26:10.777
Pre-recorded speech was horseshit,
and we are not airing it!

26:10.778 --> 26:12.028
You understand me?

26:12.029 --> 26:14.155
People deserve to know
what's really happening.

26:14.156 --> 26:16.032
They need a chance to say goodbye.

26:16.033 --> 26:17.326
Quick, we gotta go!

26:18.952 --> 26:20.161
Is the equipment still up?

26:20.162 --> 26:22.663
Yes, but please don't do this, sir.

26:22.664 --> 26:24.624
We need to-- we need to stick to the plan.

26:24.625 --> 26:27.502
We need to keep the calm.
Listen, sir. Cal!

26:27.503 --> 26:30.004
Get your fucking hands off me
and put me on TV right now.

26:30.005 --> 26:34.008
Shit! Erica, alert the networks.

26:34.009 --> 26:37.638
Mr. President, you do not leave that room
until I get back, is that understood?

26:39.181 --> 26:42.810
Sir, make sure all interior side doors
to the Oval are locked.

26:44.061 --> 26:45.062
Ryan.

26:46.188 --> 26:49.399
- Weapons ready, you're cleared hot.
- Sir?

26:50.609 --> 26:52.611
Things might escalate.

26:55.072 --> 26:57.199
Stay calm. I'll be right back.

26:58.408 --> 26:59.408
He's going live now.

26:59.409 --> 27:00.953
- All of them. All of them.
-  Rainey!

27:03.288 --> 27:04.831
- You Versailles?
- I am.

27:04.832 --> 27:06.791
- Assume you are too?
- Affirmative.

27:06.792 --> 27:08.292
Come on, baby, pick up.

27:08.293 --> 27:10.253
<i>Hi, this is Dr. Teri Rogers--</i>

27:10.254 --> 27:12.713
We got about five minutes
before the president starts talking.

27:12.714 --> 27:14.382
You think this is
gonna turn into a frenzy?

27:14.383 --> 27:17.219
It's already been a frenzy.
It's about to become a fucking riot.

27:20.222 --> 27:22.015
No, no, please. I don't need any of that.

27:22.683 --> 27:24.600
Or lighting, or equipment.

27:24.601 --> 27:26.478
Just put me on air as quick as you can.

27:27.312 --> 27:28.897
And a cup of coffee, please.

27:30.065 --> 27:31.483
Sure could use a cup of coffee.

27:39.366 --> 27:40.950
Roger that. He's clear to enter.

27:40.951 --> 27:43.453
- Back to you in two.
- Commander Hunter is Versailles too.

27:44.788 --> 27:46.914
- Who?
- Guy with the football.

27:46.915 --> 27:49.625
- What about Garcia?
- No idea.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.181
Let's get moving.

28:10.606 --> 28:14.318
It has been an honor
serving you, Mr. President.

28:17.571 --> 28:18.906
The honor is mine, John.

28:21.867 --> 28:24.328
Best fucking hamburgers I've ever had.

28:32.502 --> 28:35.047
Okay, we're 30 seconds out.

28:36.340 --> 28:39.717
<i>We are less than a minute
from the president addressing the nation.</i>

28:39.718 --> 28:41.636
<i>- We were alerted earlier...
-  Excuse me.</i>

28:43.055 --> 28:45.098
-  <i>About 40 minutes from now...
- Is that for me?</i>

28:45.682 --> 28:46.767
No one gets in.

28:47.309 --> 28:49.310
<i>Meanwhile,
sources are reporting that Marine One</i>

28:49.311 --> 28:52.188
<i>and other helicopters are hovering
above the South Lawn...</i>

28:53.857 --> 28:56.818
<i>...F22 Raptors are circling
the air space above the Capitol.</i>

28:59.655 --> 29:02.199
And we're live in three...

29:12.334 --> 29:13.752
My fellow Americans...

29:19.841 --> 29:22.427
I know you're aware
of the situation we now face.

29:25.847 --> 29:27.516
And I wanna tell you the truth.

29:31.812 --> 29:33.021
Our modeling...

29:35.524 --> 29:39.402
shows imminent worldwide disaster,
including here at home.

29:43.824 --> 29:46.117
I'm telling you this
so that you can make decisions

29:46.118 --> 29:48.161
based on where you want to be right now...

29:50.122 --> 29:51.790
and who you want to be with.

29:54.459 --> 29:56.503
<i>This position that I have held...</i>

29:58.505 --> 29:59.673
<i>I didn't always want it.</i>

30:03.635 --> 30:05.262
<i>Most certainly didn't always like it.</i>

30:08.640 --> 30:09.933
<i>But it has...</i>

30:12.519 --> 30:16.314
<i>It's provided me access
to people all over this country.</i>

30:18.734 --> 30:21.361
<i>And one thing has constantly
struck me as true.</i>

30:22.362 --> 30:24.406
<i>That despite all
the ugliness in our world...</i>

30:26.742 --> 30:28.910
<i>...despite our tendency to focus
on the grotesque,</i>

30:30.620 --> 30:31.830
<i>and the conflict.</i>

30:33.373 --> 30:34.458
<i>Despite all of that...</i>

30:37.085 --> 30:38.295
you...

30:39.504 --> 30:40.672
you...

30:41.673 --> 30:43.133
are inherently decent.

30:45.260 --> 30:49.221
You love your families,
your parents, your children.

30:53.685 --> 30:54.936
Let's go. This way!

30:57.773 --> 31:00.525
And I hope we can find that decency
and that love now.

31:09.826 --> 31:11.495
And if I may be so bold.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.165
<i>To all of you watching,</i>

31:16.124 --> 31:18.418
<i>who have meant something
to me personally...</i>

31:20.629 --> 31:21.755
too many to name...

31:25.425 --> 31:26.968
I just want to say I love you.

31:30.514 --> 31:32.349
And, uh...

31:43.318 --> 31:44.986
God bless you and good luck.

31:48.615 --> 31:49.616
We're out.

31:50.659 --> 31:51.827
Move it!

31:52.410 --> 31:53.578
Here we go.

31:54.246 --> 31:55.412
On me.

31:55.413 --> 31:57.748
<i>Now, what hope does
humanity have to survive?</i>

31:57.749 --> 31:59.417
- Excuse us.
- Wait a minute.

32:05.549 --> 32:06.883
I'm sorry, everyone.

32:08.885 --> 32:11.804
Mr. President,
my sister is here with Edward.

32:11.805 --> 32:13.347
They're at the gate,
so I'm gonna go get him.

32:13.348 --> 32:15.767
- Marsha.
-  <i>We have to do better.</i>

32:17.811 --> 32:19.729
I've been with you since the beginning.

32:20.313 --> 32:23.107
You told me everything was gonna be okay.

32:23.108 --> 32:25.735
I wish I could say something
that would make this better, but I can't.

32:26.903 --> 32:28.696
I can't offer you safety.
You can stay here if you want,

32:28.697 --> 32:30.699
but the truth is it's not gonna help.

32:31.950 --> 32:33.492
Nothing is. Go home.

32:33.493 --> 32:35.244
- And where are you going?
-  Hey, hey, back off.

32:35.245 --> 32:38.664
-  How long did you know?
- People, this is the cold reality.

32:38.665 --> 32:41.750
We need to ask for those willing
to keep the White House secure

32:41.751 --> 32:43.627
until we can all get out.

32:43.628 --> 32:45.504
Continue to evacuate everyone,

32:45.505 --> 32:48.382
but right now, your duty
is to keep the president safe.

32:48.383 --> 32:49.633
- Where are you?
- What about us, Todd?

32:49.634 --> 32:51.844
Huh? What about all of us?!

32:51.845 --> 32:54.221
- Back off!
- Calm down.

32:54.222 --> 32:57.474
I need you to calm down, okay?
Let's move him now!

32:57.475 --> 32:59.977
-  Come on. Come on.
-  Okay? Hey.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.062
Let's go. Down the hall! Come on!

33:02.063 --> 33:03.439
You promised me.

33:03.440 --> 33:04.857
Marsha...

33:04.858 --> 33:06.525
The blood of my baby
is gonna be on your hands.

33:06.526 --> 33:08.402
I couldn't do anything about it,
Marsha, understand that.

33:08.403 --> 33:09.904
- You promised me.
- I'm really sorry.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.489
Hey. Hey. Don't!

33:16.703 --> 33:17.913
Don't.

33:19.539 --> 33:20.665
Don't.

33:25.795 --> 33:26.962
Move.

33:26.963 --> 33:28.215
Come on, come on.

33:33.053 --> 33:34.054
Shit.

33:42.520 --> 33:45.023
Forget the groups. Load in Wildcat.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.404
Inside. Come on. Come on.

33:56.910 --> 33:58.911
Go to the next one.

33:58.912 --> 34:00.579
- Cover them.
- Alright, let's go.

34:00.580 --> 34:02.122
Stay where you are!

34:02.123 --> 34:04.667
Don't make me shoot.

34:13.969 --> 34:16.304
- Thanks, Cal, I enjoyed that.
- Fuck you.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.349
- It was the right thing to do.
- We're not out of this yet.

34:20.767 --> 34:22.977
Marine One took hits, then peeled off.

34:22.978 --> 34:25.020
- Hits from who?
- Don't know, sir.

34:25.021 --> 34:27.273
People are surging onto the South Lawn.

34:27.274 --> 34:28.649
There's a CAT Team waiting.

34:28.650 --> 34:31.860
You will load into the first gunship,
then take off immediately.

34:31.861 --> 34:35.030
I'll go back up for the others.
Do not wait for us.

34:36.741 --> 34:37.993
Move!

34:39.160 --> 34:40.954
Prepare for live fire. Go!

34:59.931 --> 35:01.516
Ryan, hold this.

35:08.148 --> 35:10.358
Mr. President, put this on.

35:12.569 --> 35:13.570
Okay.

35:16.698 --> 35:17.866
Hold.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.417
Ready?

35:28.418 --> 35:30.337
- Yeah.
- Open the door.

35:50.106 --> 35:51.107
Move!

35:52.233 --> 35:53.568
Keep them back!

36:01.201 --> 36:02.242
Go! Go!

36:02.243 --> 36:03.578
- The football!
- Shit.

36:13.296 --> 36:14.380
Here you go.

36:14.381 --> 36:16.091
<i>...has been secured.
You're cleared for takeoff.</i>

36:17.384 --> 36:18.759
Whoa!

36:18.760 --> 36:20.302
- No.
- No, no, no, there's room.

36:20.303 --> 36:21.720
Your orders are to stay here.

36:21.721 --> 36:23.472
No, I'm going where you're going.

36:23.473 --> 36:24.641
You can't.

36:25.642 --> 36:26.809
I'm going where you're going!

36:26.810 --> 36:28.435
Ryan.

36:28.436 --> 36:31.939
What the fuck?! He wasn't gonna shoot me!

36:31.940 --> 36:34.109
Do your fucking job, Agent!

36:35.110 --> 36:38.445
Go! Go! Let the other choppers land!

36:38.446 --> 36:41.199
Up! Up! Hoist up that chopper, let's go!

37:37.380 --> 37:41.258
Freebird One, say again,
Congress, Justices, Freebird Two,

37:41.259 --> 37:44.595
Cabinet, Joint Chiefs,
others, Freebird One.

37:46.723 --> 37:48.224
Let's go! Let's go!

37:49.976 --> 37:51.978
Move! Let's go!

37:55.064 --> 37:56.482
Agent Collins!

37:57.609 --> 37:58.902
Xavier!

38:03.406 --> 38:04.531
I have to get her somehow.

38:04.532 --> 38:06.658
Come on, man, your kids are onboard.
Let's go.

38:06.659 --> 38:08.410
She's alone.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.537
I don't know where she is.
I don't know who she's with.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.623
It's an impossible situation.

38:12.624 --> 38:14.166
I'm sorry.

38:14.167 --> 38:16.251
I can't get on that plane without her.

38:16.252 --> 38:17.545
Xavier, look at me.

38:19.506 --> 38:23.092
Your kids need you. I need you.

38:24.093 --> 38:25.094
Let's go.

38:30.266 --> 38:32.435
When did you know
she wasn't gonna make it?

38:37.816 --> 38:39.400
When you told me she was still in Atlanta.

38:44.072 --> 38:46.365
She was there because
she didn't know what was coming.

38:46.366 --> 38:48.742
- Why didn't you tell me what was coming?
- I tried.

38:48.743 --> 38:50.828
- No. You hinted!
- I did, I tried.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.580
Right? You danced around.
There was no urgency.

38:53.581 --> 38:55.833
We didn't know how fast
it was gonna escalate.

38:55.834 --> 38:58.503
- Right, but I see your family is here.
- No.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.255
Careful.

39:01.256 --> 39:03.091
I would have kept her close!

39:03.925 --> 39:07.302
I would have prepared.
People would have prepared.

39:07.303 --> 39:09.346
But instead, you played this game.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.889
- I did my best.
- Your best?

39:10.890 --> 39:13.100
- Yes, in an impossible situation.
- Oh, you think you're brave

39:13.101 --> 39:14.476
because you told everybody that the world

39:14.477 --> 39:15.978
- was ending 10 minutes ago.
- There were no easy options, Xavier.

39:15.979 --> 39:17.104
- Listen to me.
- You should have told us all

39:17.105 --> 39:18.188
- 10 years ago.
- The world is falling apart!

39:18.189 --> 39:19.398
- Look at what's happening.
- This is not my fault.

39:19.399 --> 39:21.441
Look at what you let happen!

39:21.442 --> 39:22.569
That's enough!

39:24.320 --> 39:27.030
If you don't want a seat on that plane,
there's roughly eight billion people

39:27.031 --> 39:29.284
on this planet who will fucking take it.

39:32.537 --> 39:35.414
Your wife is gone, and I'm sorry,

39:35.415 --> 39:37.041
but you need to process that.

39:37.709 --> 39:40.253
And go be with your children,
because they just lost their mother.

39:40.962 --> 39:41.963
Sir.

39:43.506 --> 39:46.009
Sir, we have to go.

39:49.721 --> 39:53.349
- Are you coming or not?
- I don't know what to do.

39:56.269 --> 39:57.644
Yeah, you do.

40:10.575 --> 40:13.076
<i>Each of you have been
given a packet of information</i>

40:13.077 --> 40:16.204
<i>and a wrist device
that is paired specifically to you.</i>

40:16.205 --> 40:19.083
<i>We'll be taking off
for Colorado momentarily.</i>

40:23.671 --> 40:24.672
Hey.

40:25.840 --> 40:26.924
- Daddy.
- Daddy.

40:26.925 --> 40:28.300
I thought you didn't make it.

40:28.301 --> 40:29.928
No, no, I'm here.

40:31.471 --> 40:34.349
- Stand up.
-  Where's Mommy?

40:39.145 --> 40:40.188
Is she okay?

40:50.198 --> 40:52.533
Where's Mommy? Where's Mom?

41:11.219 --> 41:12.803
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
brace yourselves.</i>

41:12.804 --> 41:15.473
<i>We're about to encounter
the high-pressure sound waves.</i>

41:17.058 --> 41:19.434
Alright, man, go get in the seat.
Put on your seatbelt.

41:19.435 --> 41:20.560
Oh, my God.

41:20.561 --> 41:22.479
Hold on, stay right here. Hold on.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.772
Daddy, I'm scared.

41:23.773 --> 41:26.066
Oh, my God.

41:26.067 --> 41:27.150
Dad, what's going on?

41:27.151 --> 41:28.277
It's okay.

41:29.028 --> 41:32.156
Okay.

41:37.453 --> 41:39.246
-  We gonna make it?
-  I got you.

41:39.247 --> 41:41.249
-  What was that?
-  What's happening?

41:41.791 --> 41:43.292
One of the planes went down.

42:29.422 --> 42:30.590
I'm sorry.

42:37.305 --> 42:39.140
I've been told this...

42:40.516 --> 42:42.351
might break through to a cellphone.

42:45.063 --> 42:46.814
You can use the liaison office.

42:51.069 --> 42:54.113
Sir, you're needed upstairs.
It's the Joint Chiefs.

43:11.089 --> 43:13.799
Mr. President, Freebird Two
went down with the pressure wave.

43:13.800 --> 43:16.969
That's the Justices, Congress, Todd.

43:21.516 --> 43:23.266
General, what do you have?

43:23.267 --> 43:25.227
<i>Sir, as predicted,
several nuclear devices</i>

43:25.228 --> 43:27.395
<i>have just launched,
one headed towards India,</i>

43:27.396 --> 43:30.107
<i>and another targeting what we believe
will be Denver, Colorado.</i>

43:30.108 --> 43:31.566
Are they aiming for us?

43:31.567 --> 43:33.110
-  <i>We don't know.
- You don't know?</i>

43:33.111 --> 43:35.113
<i>Our intelligence networks
are breaking down, sir.</i>

43:35.738 --> 43:37.531
<i>All we know is it's headed your way.</i>

43:37.532 --> 43:39.116
<i>There have also been
two nuclear detonations</i>

43:39.117 --> 43:41.785
<i>around the Mongolian border.
It's starting, sir.</i>

43:41.786 --> 43:44.162
<i>That's why it's the consensus
of the Joint Chiefs</i>

43:44.163 --> 43:45.413
<i>that we fire our arsenal.</i>

43:45.414 --> 43:47.124
Christ, at who?

43:47.125 --> 43:49.127
<i>All nuclear powers, full-scale attack.</i>

43:49.794 --> 43:52.045
<i>We must prevent any attack
on the bunker location at all costs.</i>

43:52.046 --> 43:53.505
<i>It's our only chance for survival.</i>

43:53.506 --> 43:55.590
For those of us on this call.

43:55.591 --> 43:57.425
What about everyone else out there?

43:57.426 --> 43:59.637
<i>Sir, we're not saying this
to spare ourselves.</i>

44:00.221 --> 44:01.555
<i>Our plane isn't going
to make it to the bunker.</i>

44:01.556 --> 44:03.099
<i>We took severe damage
from the pressure wave.</i>

44:03.683 --> 44:05.267
<i>We're putting down outside St. Louis.</i>

44:05.268 --> 44:08.228
<i>Mr. President,
we do not come to this lightly.</i>

44:08.229 --> 44:12.691
<i>That eruption is going to destroy
supply chains and crop production.</i>

44:12.692 --> 44:15.987
<i>Every nation on the planet
with a military understands this.</i>

44:16.571 --> 44:20.490
<i>And they will act to protect themselves
against possible incursions,</i>

44:20.491 --> 44:22.160
<i>knowing that we will do the same.</i>

44:23.744 --> 44:25.413
<i>Mr. President, you must launch.</i>

44:26.330 --> 44:29.500
<i>Once the ash cloud covers our skies,
we cannot guarantee launch capabilities.</i>

44:30.251 --> 44:32.461
<i>Enter the code, sir, and we are a go.</i>

44:37.216 --> 44:38.217
Understood.

44:39.677 --> 44:43.639
Good luck, gentlemen.
I'm taking a second in my office.

45:16.130 --> 45:19.090
When the team ran our scenario
through thousands of models,

45:19.091 --> 45:20.760
it always told us the same thing.

45:22.220 --> 45:23.595
Yeah, what was that?

45:23.596 --> 45:26.473
The eruption of the
Antarctic super volcano

45:26.474 --> 45:28.226
would lead to nuclear war.

45:30.645 --> 45:31.729
Lovely.

45:36.484 --> 45:41.238
You know, when I became president,

45:41.239 --> 45:44.617
the first thing I asked about,
hand to God, was the secrets.

45:46.661 --> 45:51.665
Aliens, who killed JFK, Bigfoot--
and there was nothing.

45:51.666 --> 45:55.086
I mean, little things, but really nothing.

45:57.421 --> 46:00.383
I was so disappointed. But then...

46:02.510 --> 46:04.303
I was briefed on this little guy.

46:05.763 --> 46:07.223
The nuclear football.

46:08.516 --> 46:10.433
The device that allows
the commander-in-chief

46:10.434 --> 46:14.146
to unilaterally launch
America's entire nuclear arsenal.

46:15.982 --> 46:17.441
No two-person system.

46:19.151 --> 46:21.737
Just me and the red codes.

46:24.991 --> 46:27.118
I enter this, and we are off to the races.

46:29.328 --> 46:32.080
But basically everybody
knows about the football.

46:32.081 --> 46:37.420
What nobody, except the president knows,
is what else it can do...

46:43.509 --> 46:44.927
if I enter the blue code.

46:46.721 --> 46:50.849
Turns out, after the Cuban Missile Crisis,
some colonel had an idea

46:50.850 --> 46:54.854
to create a switch, an ultimate fail-safe.

46:56.105 --> 46:58.899
A linked array of global EMPs...

47:00.318 --> 47:03.696
in satellites, submarines,
missiles, you name it...

47:04.989 --> 47:07.616
that would fry every
electronic circuit on Earth.

47:08.909 --> 47:11.454
Microwaves, computers.

47:12.580 --> 47:14.081
Even its own satellites.

47:16.709 --> 47:18.669
But it would also disable the nukes,

47:20.296 --> 47:21.797
maybe even in midair.

47:23.591 --> 47:25.843
It's a switch that would
shut off the world.

47:27.428 --> 47:30.931
Unfortunately, it would also
take the planet back 500 years.

47:33.476 --> 47:35.519
But that was better
than the alternative...

47:37.646 --> 47:39.565
because it would give people a chance.

47:42.860 --> 47:45.071
You can't be considering this.

47:49.867 --> 47:52.494
-  <i>Flight deck.
-  How long till we land?</i>

47:52.495 --> 47:55.247
-  <i>Twenty minutes, Mr. President.
- Thank you.</i>

47:58.042 --> 47:59.627
Well, that should be
more than enough time.

48:00.461 --> 48:02.338
It takes a while to shut down
the whole world.

48:05.341 --> 48:07.468
With any luck,
we'll be in the mountain by then.

48:10.888 --> 48:12.807
All those people will die anyway.

48:14.975 --> 48:17.685
It's more humane to let it happen
in a bright flash

48:17.686 --> 48:20.105
than to let them all starve
over the course of a year.

48:20.106 --> 48:21.899
They need a chance.

48:23.401 --> 48:24.735
We need a chance.

48:26.445 --> 48:29.155
The bunker relies on outside sensors
for communication,

48:29.156 --> 48:33.369
for the safety of the city,
so that we know when it's safe out there.

48:33.953 --> 48:35.912
We will be blind. We will be vulnerable.

48:35.913 --> 48:40.042
Samantha, I ain't launching the missiles.

48:41.752 --> 48:43.003
But I am gonna do this.

48:48.884 --> 48:51.470
Stop. Stop, stop! Please.

48:52.471 --> 48:54.557
We are humanity's last hope.

48:55.641 --> 48:57.226
Well, maybe the thing won't work.

48:58.602 --> 48:59.770
That'll be all.

49:01.230 --> 49:02.356
Agent Rainey.

49:04.817 --> 49:07.778
If she doesn't move, shoot her.

49:42.605 --> 49:45.023
-  <i>Hello?
- Teri, it's me.</i>

49:45.024 --> 49:46.774
<i>Oh, my God. Where are you?</i>

49:46.775 --> 49:48.359
Where are you?

49:48.360 --> 49:51.112
<i>Couldn't make it. I'm so sorry.</i>

49:51.113 --> 49:54.157
<i>I tried, baby, I-- I even stole a car.</i>

49:54.158 --> 49:55.743
It's okay.

50:09.757 --> 50:11.174
<i>The kids, are they safe?</i>

50:11.175 --> 50:14.845
They're safe. We're safe.
Uh, they're taking us somewhere safe.

50:15.554 --> 50:17.388
-  <i>Where?
-  Um...</i>

50:17.389 --> 50:18.973
Colorado.

50:18.974 --> 50:21.768
Somewhere-- somewhere in Colorado.

50:40.663 --> 50:42.831
<i>Baby, listen to me,
this might cut out.</i>

50:45.417 --> 50:48.212
- Hm?
<i>- Tell them it's okay to be happy, okay?</i>

50:50.130 --> 50:53.676
<i>That Mommy loves them,
whether I'm there or not.</i>

50:55.928 --> 50:57.888
I will, baby. I will.

51:04.520 --> 51:06.729
<i>Are you still there? Xavier?</i>

51:06.730 --> 51:08.899
Hey, I'm here. I'm here.

51:15.864 --> 51:17.157
<i>Xavier.</i>

51:23.872 --> 51:25.748
<i>Xavier, can you hear me?</i>

51:25.749 --> 51:28.793
- Yeah, baby.
-  <i>I'm scared, baby.</i>

51:28.794 --> 51:31.547
No. No, no, no, I'm with you.

51:32.673 --> 51:35.633
Yeah. You feel me?
I'm-- I'm holding you right now.

51:35.634 --> 51:38.345
I'm protecting you, baby.

51:39.513 --> 51:41.806
- I got you.
-  <i>Okay. Okay.</i>

51:41.807 --> 51:44.934
I got you.

51:54.028 --> 51:55.446
Teri, can you hear me?

51:56.488 --> 51:59.115
-  <i>I loved every minute.
- Hey, Ter?</i>

51:59.116 --> 52:03.161
-  <i>Promise me something.
- I love you, baby.</i>

52:03.162 --> 52:05.204
-  <i>I love you too.
- I love you more than anything</i>

52:05.205 --> 52:07.999
on this planet, I love you so much, Teri.
I love you.

52:08.000 --> 52:10.001
-  <i>Me too, baby.
- I love you.</i>

52:20.804 --> 52:23.599
<i>Be a good father. Be a good father.</i>

52:24.683 --> 52:26.018
<i>Be a good father to them.</i>

52:55.964 --> 52:57.257
I guess it worked.

52:59.093 --> 53:01.470
Nuclear holocaust
was at least partially avoided.

53:02.721 --> 53:04.807
And no missiles hit Atlanta.

53:05.391 --> 53:07.183
You can't know that for sure.

53:07.184 --> 53:09.937
People are rebuilding,
finding ways to communicate.

53:11.271 --> 53:13.773
<i>...for a secondary route
to Denver, Colorado.</i>

53:13.774 --> 53:16.401
<i>...large area outside of Atlanta.</i>

53:16.402 --> 53:19.320
<i>I'm looking for
my husband, Xavier Collins.</i>

53:19.321 --> 53:21.531
<i>My children, Presley and James.</i>

53:21.532 --> 53:24.325
<i>They were heading
for a complex in Colorado.</i>

53:24.326 --> 53:27.495
<i>Once again, my name
is Teri Rogers-Collins.</i>

53:27.496 --> 53:31.457
<i>I'm here with other survivors
searching for our loved ones.</i>

53:31.458 --> 53:34.585
<i>If you know the whereabouts
of Xavier Collins,</i>

53:34.586 --> 53:36.629
<i>tell him I love him.</i>

53:42.386 --> 53:45.222
Where is she? How do I find her?

53:53.021 --> 53:55.023
Let me just make one quick call,

53:56.483 --> 53:58.569
then you can shoot me
to your heart's content.

54:04.783 --> 54:06.118
<i>Tavern.</i>

54:08.245 --> 54:10.289
You might want to
check on your daughter.

54:14.084 --> 54:15.085
Hey, Mark.

54:16.086 --> 54:17.921
It's Xavier. Put Presley on the line.

54:19.590 --> 54:20.883
<i>She's not here.</i>

54:22.259 --> 54:23.634
What'd you say?

54:23.635 --> 54:25.970
<i>She's not here, man.
I don't know what happened.</i>

54:25.971 --> 54:27.597
<i>I just checked the back room
and she's just gone.</i>

54:31.643 --> 54:33.562
The DNA from Cal's murder...

54:35.272 --> 54:37.065
didn't match anyone in the bunker.

54:38.776 --> 54:41.487
It appears our killer
came from the outside.

54:43.989 --> 54:45.866
What did you do to my daughter?

54:49.369 --> 54:50.913
You will release my people.

54:51.788 --> 54:54.040
You will return my arsenal of weapons,

54:54.041 --> 54:56.460
and you will find out
who murdered the president,

54:57.127 --> 55:00.421
and you will return this place
to fucking normal

55:00.422 --> 55:03.467
if you ever wanna see
your daughter or your wife again.

55:11.850 --> 55:13.310
Maybe I am a monster.
