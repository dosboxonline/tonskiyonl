00:13.847 --> 00:14.848
<i>Francis.</i>

00:18.435 --> 00:21.146
<i>It's painful, I know,
but try to remember.</i>

00:25.442 --> 00:27.068
<i>Go back to that time.</i>

00:29.112 --> 00:30.280
<i>Go back.</i>

01:10.695 --> 01:11.696
Fran, it's me.

01:15.700 --> 01:16.618
Fran?

01:17.410 --> 01:18.703
It's me.

01:20.372 --> 01:22.332
Come on, doll. Open up.

01:29.130 --> 01:30.423
You getting any sleep?

01:48.525 --> 01:49.776
They were good boys.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.409
It might do you some good
to get out of the house.

01:58.868 --> 02:00.286
I'm worried about you, Fran.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.915
And I wish you'd let me pay
for their funeral.

02:04.916 --> 02:06.710
Give Jack and Benny
a nice send-off.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.086
I could talk to Father Vincent.

02:09.087 --> 02:10.088
- I'm sure--
- Why?

02:10.755 --> 02:12.548
So people can shove tissues
in my face

02:12.549 --> 02:14.384
and tell me it was God's will?

02:15.343 --> 02:18.304
I don't need a public display
to mourn my boys.

02:21.016 --> 02:23.351
Oz has been coming around
the store a lot lately.

02:24.811 --> 02:28.647
Says you won't speak to him
and barely look him in the eye.

02:28.648 --> 02:32.610
Oswald has always been
so goddamn needy.

02:34.195 --> 02:36.072
I'd made peace with it. I did.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.366
That he was different.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.370
But now, what he's done,
I can't.

02:46.374 --> 02:47.667
What's he done?

02:52.839 --> 02:53.673
Fran?

03:03.016 --> 03:04.476
I found this in his coat.

03:06.728 --> 03:07.728
I don't...

03:07.729 --> 03:09.064
He was with 'em, Rex.

03:10.607 --> 03:11.441
He lied to me.

03:12.317 --> 03:13.276
He came home,

03:14.152 --> 03:15.444
actin' all sad,

03:15.445 --> 03:16.654
like he was the victim,

03:16.780 --> 03:17.696
but he knew.

03:17.697 --> 03:19.990
My babies were drowning
in those tunnels,

03:19.991 --> 03:21.743
and he didn't say
a goddamn word.

03:23.495 --> 03:25.579
He had every chance,
every goddamn chance,

03:25.580 --> 03:27.122
to say somethin',
to do somethin',

03:27.123 --> 03:28.624
anything, to stop it.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.710
- He's a kid.
- He locked them inside.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.546
The room where they found them,
the cops told me,

03:34.547 --> 03:37.175
they had to pry the fuckin' door
open to reach 'em.

03:38.968 --> 03:41.220
If I had known,
if he had just...

03:41.221 --> 03:42.179
I coulda saved 'em.

03:42.180 --> 03:43.932
They'd be here with me right now.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.644
But Oswald didn't want that.
No. This is what he wanted.

03:48.645 --> 03:51.189
Me. All to himself.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.445
I got the devil
in my house, Rex.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.408
What the hell
am I supposed to do?

04:11.084 --> 04:13.920
There are a couple different ways
to handle this type of situation.

04:15.880 --> 04:17.924
If Oz is what you say,

04:18.842 --> 04:20.969
well, guys like him,

04:21.845 --> 04:23.471
they can serve a purpose,

04:24.097 --> 04:25.597
go on to do big fuckin' things,

04:25.598 --> 04:27.391
especially in my line of work.

04:27.392 --> 04:28.852
But you gotta know
how to control them.

04:29.936 --> 04:32.980
Mostly, guys that come to me say
they're lookin' to make money.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.189
Now, that's fine.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.818
But greed don't buy loyalty.

04:38.069 --> 04:39.404
I want loyalty,

04:40.780 --> 04:42.657
I bring in guys
who are lookin' for a father.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.576
Guys like that
got a void to fill.

04:45.577 --> 04:47.037
They'll do anything for me.

04:48.329 --> 04:51.249
Now, Oswald...

04:52.083 --> 04:53.251
he don't need a father.

04:55.587 --> 04:56.629
He's got you.

04:58.798 --> 05:00.133
He's devoted to you.

05:00.967 --> 05:02.260
You can use that.

05:03.261 --> 05:06.431
Foster what he's got,
embrace it, raise it.

05:08.808 --> 05:09.809
Maybe he'd be great.

05:11.853 --> 05:13.146
Or maybe not. I don't know.

05:14.981 --> 05:16.483
You have to bet on him to see.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.069
You want me
to look the other way?

05:20.028 --> 05:21.363
Ignore what he's done?

05:23.740 --> 05:25.367
What kind of mother
would I be...

05:26.826 --> 05:27.869
if I...

05:30.747 --> 05:31.623
I can't.

05:39.422 --> 05:40.965
Well then, maybe let him go.

05:44.094 --> 05:46.346
By "let him go," you mean...

06:01.069 --> 06:03.363
You'd be willin' to help me
with somethin' like that?

06:15.166 --> 06:15.959
Ma?

06:16.918 --> 06:18.169
I got dinner for ya.

06:26.469 --> 06:27.512
You're up.

06:28.471 --> 06:29.723
Get dressed.

06:30.682 --> 06:31.516
We're goin' out.

06:33.768 --> 06:34.978
Go on. Your suit.

07:05.925 --> 07:07.344
Ma, look who's here.

07:11.681 --> 07:12.891
Yeah, sweetheart.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.268
Rex is gonna
drive you home later.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.271
- Really?
- Really.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.191
I know I been absent lately,

07:21.316 --> 07:24.069
so I wanted to make tonight
extra special.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.322
I know you miss 'em, Ma.

07:29.908 --> 07:30.950
I do too.

07:44.673 --> 07:45.757
No, wait.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.301
Everything's all right.

07:50.762 --> 07:52.262
- Francis.
- Wait. What are you...

07:52.263 --> 07:54.306
Let's just try and stay
in the moment, okay?

07:54.307 --> 07:55.433
Huh?

07:56.017 --> 07:58.144
You're with Oswald,
your son.

07:59.604 --> 08:02.065
You took him
to the jazz club, Monroe's.

08:04.651 --> 08:05.652
Go with it.

08:08.780 --> 08:09.698
I did...

08:12.283 --> 08:13.284
That's right.

08:18.623 --> 08:19.624
Ma?

08:22.210 --> 08:23.044
Ma?

08:23.670 --> 08:25.505
I'm gonna take care of you, Ma.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.258
You know that, right?

08:29.718 --> 08:32.679
You've been workin' so hard
for the three of us.

08:33.763 --> 08:35.431
It's gonna be easier now.

08:35.432 --> 08:36.725
I'll get a job.

08:37.475 --> 08:38.767
And I got all kinds of ideas

08:38.768 --> 08:40.686
on how to make cash
on the side, too.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.188
Yeah, you sound like your father.

08:42.814 --> 08:43.857
That ain't true.

08:45.608 --> 08:47.027
I mean what I say.

08:49.446 --> 08:50.613
What do you want?

08:51.990 --> 08:53.532
Tell me, and I'll get it.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.658
What do I want?

08:54.659 --> 08:57.287
You got it all figured out,
don't you?

08:58.163 --> 08:59.663
Look at you.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.415
Your balls have barely dropped,

09:01.416 --> 09:03.083
and you're gonna take care
of <i>me?</i>

09:03.084 --> 09:04.836
Of course
I'm gonna take care of you.

09:07.130 --> 09:08.673
I'd do anything for you.

09:10.216 --> 09:11.217
I see you, Ma.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.303
In ways that other people don't.

09:14.179 --> 09:17.306
I see the way you smile
when you want people to think

09:17.307 --> 09:19.225
you're enjoying somethin'
you ain't.

09:20.477 --> 09:22.771
I see how you smoke more
when you're thinkin',

09:23.563 --> 09:25.190
and you drink more
when you're sad.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.650
I see how hard you work,

09:28.151 --> 09:29.402
how smart you are...

09:31.029 --> 09:33.490
and how you wish the people
who matter would notice...

09:34.741 --> 09:37.702
or the people like that
wouldn't matter at all.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.830
No one else believes in you
like me.

09:41.664 --> 09:44.501
No one else is gonna give you
what you deserve.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.003
I'm gonna get you
out of the Eastside, Ma.

09:47.796 --> 09:49.714
Put you up somewhere real nice.

09:50.382 --> 09:51.799
Better than what we got now.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.259
Yeah, better's easy
than where we are.

09:54.260 --> 09:55.719
The best then.

09:55.720 --> 09:58.055
On the top floor,
in a penthouse, like you want,

09:58.056 --> 10:00.766
with a view
of the whole friggin' city.

10:00.767 --> 10:04.061
I'll get you expensive clothes
and-and jewelry.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.438
Nice shit, too.

10:06.064 --> 10:08.316
The kind where people see you
on the street and think,

10:08.942 --> 10:10.068
"She's important."

10:10.735 --> 10:12.195
And if you don't believe me,

10:12.737 --> 10:14.114
well, you don't gotta.

10:14.989 --> 10:16.533
'Cause I'm gonna prove it to ya.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.618
Every damn day.

10:20.495 --> 10:21.496
Just...

10:24.040 --> 10:25.250
Just don't give up on me.

10:36.094 --> 10:37.178
Come on, Ma.

10:38.722 --> 10:39.806
Dance with me.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.280
Left here. Left here.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.079
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

11:11.463 --> 11:12.589
What is that?

11:27.562 --> 11:28.855
Oh, my God.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.944
Fuck. Oz.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.822
Hey, he could be hurt.
We gotta get down there.

11:38.823 --> 11:41.116
- Oz is probably dead.
- Gonna be crawling with cops.

11:41.117 --> 11:43.828
You don't know that, all right?
We gotta check. Let's go.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.206
Your friend has put us
in a dangerous position.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.918
- Let's get outta here.
- Wait. Wait. That's it?

11:50.794 --> 11:52.712
We're here for the product,
not the Penguin.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.341
Wow. You're all a bunch

11:57.342 --> 11:58.968
of fucking cowards,
you know that?

12:00.303 --> 12:01.137
What did you say?

12:02.263 --> 12:03.806
What the hell
do you even stand for?

12:03.807 --> 12:06.266
What, are you gonna let
the Maronis and Gigantes do

12:06.267 --> 12:07.977
whatever they fuckin' want?

12:09.270 --> 12:10.355
This is my neighborhood!

12:10.855 --> 12:12.148
Look at it!

12:14.609 --> 12:18.821
The whole world, they treat us
like-like we don't matter,

12:18.822 --> 12:21.323
like we're fuckin' nothin'.
Are you just gonna run away now?

12:21.324 --> 12:22.783
That's bullshit!

12:22.784 --> 12:24.576
Watch what you say.

12:24.577 --> 12:27.455
You gotta know your place,
or you're gonna catch a bullet.

12:28.206 --> 12:29.665
Then you really don't matter.

12:29.666 --> 12:30.667
Let's go.

12:46.016 --> 12:47.434
I need you to step back.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.156
Stand back!
Move it!

13:02.157 --> 13:04.992
- Go back to your homes!
- What homes?

13:04.993 --> 13:07.078
Stand back!
It's not safe!

13:10.915 --> 13:12.166
Can't go in there.

13:12.167 --> 13:13.084
Victor!

13:15.211 --> 13:16.129
Victor!

13:17.172 --> 13:18.255
Zeke.

13:18.256 --> 13:20.132
Hey, man, what happened?
Where's Oz?

13:20.133 --> 13:22.468
Sofia...
She blew it all up.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.763
What about Oz? Did he get out?

13:42.989 --> 13:44.366
It's time to wake up.

13:58.922 --> 13:59.923
Oz?

14:02.467 --> 14:03.468
It's been a minute.

14:24.906 --> 14:26.908
You know,
when Berto and I were kids,

14:28.576 --> 14:30.744
we found this nest
out by the greenhouse

14:30.745 --> 14:32.664
with two baby birds inside.

14:35.208 --> 14:39.295
One of the birds
was bigger than the other one...

14:40.422 --> 14:41.423
stronger.

14:42.674 --> 14:45.802
And the mama bird
gave it more food.

14:47.429 --> 14:49.055
And I got nervous
for the smaller bird.

14:50.265 --> 14:54.144
It was so weak and frail,
you know?

14:55.270 --> 14:57.479
I... I thought
it was going to die.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.773
But then one morning,

14:59.524 --> 15:01.609
when the mama bird was away,

15:03.570 --> 15:04.738
the smaller bird...

15:06.364 --> 15:09.617
viciously attacked
the bigger bird...

15:11.745 --> 15:12.704
and killed it.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.124
And then it just pushed
its brother out of the nest.

15:19.836 --> 15:23.590
It was the most disturbing thing
I had ever seen.

15:24.341 --> 15:26.843
At least... at the time.

15:28.303 --> 15:29.720
Can you imagine?

15:29.721 --> 15:32.724
Doing something so terrible
to your own brother?

15:34.559 --> 15:36.186
But that's not even
the wildest part.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.438
When the mama bird came back

15:39.689 --> 15:43.401
and saw that one of her babies
was missing,

15:45.195 --> 15:46.529
guess what she did.

15:51.034 --> 15:52.035
Nothing.

15:54.287 --> 15:57.290
Instead of punishing
the smaller bird,

15:58.166 --> 16:02.461
she kept feeding it,
caring for it

16:02.462 --> 16:04.422
as if nothing even happened.

16:06.424 --> 16:08.176
Do you think
the mother knew, Oz...

16:09.719 --> 16:11.054
what her baby did?

16:13.181 --> 16:15.558
Francis, what do you think?

16:19.771 --> 16:20.939
Should we find out?

16:23.233 --> 16:24.150
Whaddya say?

16:25.276 --> 16:27.027
Share some hard truths?

16:27.028 --> 16:28.697
It might bring about
some healing.

16:29.280 --> 16:30.407
Oz?

16:32.450 --> 16:34.034
Would you like to start?

16:34.035 --> 16:35.994
You fuckin' psycho!

16:35.995 --> 16:37.329
What is this shit?

16:37.330 --> 16:38.915
Talkin' about birds!

16:39.040 --> 16:40.125
Jesus Christ!

16:40.625 --> 16:41.500
You don't like my story?

16:41.501 --> 16:43.168
Ma! Ma, look at me!

16:43.169 --> 16:45.295
I'm gonna get you outta here.
I swear to God, Ma.

16:45.296 --> 16:46.964
I swear to God
I'm gonna get you outta here.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.758
- Oz... you're right.
- Ma!

16:49.676 --> 16:50.927
It was a stupid story.

16:52.762 --> 16:54.472
And you have
the better one anyway.

16:55.682 --> 16:56.516
So...

16:58.184 --> 16:59.476
tell us what happened.

16:59.477 --> 17:01.146
What are you talkin'...
What happened when?

17:01.730 --> 17:05.399
Tell us why
you left your brothers to die

17:05.400 --> 17:06.484
in those tunnels.

17:10.905 --> 17:12.281
What the hell
are you talkin' about?

17:12.282 --> 17:16.035
Why did you tell your mom
you weren't with them?

17:16.036 --> 17:17.494
Why did you lie to her?

17:17.495 --> 17:19.329
What the hell
are you talkin' about?!

17:19.330 --> 17:20.290
Stop pretending.

17:20.999 --> 17:22.917
She knows. I know.

17:23.460 --> 17:25.628
We all know what you did.

17:27.505 --> 17:28.757
You done somethin' to her.

17:30.300 --> 17:31.550
What the fuck
did you do to her?!

17:31.551 --> 17:34.054
You act like
you tell her everything.

17:34.888 --> 17:37.849
And she acts like
she believes you. Why?

17:39.434 --> 17:42.811
Why are you both so afraid
of the truth?

17:42.812 --> 17:45.189
- Ma!
- It's so sick.

17:45.190 --> 17:46.107
Ma!

17:47.400 --> 17:49.027
It's almost as sick

17:49.569 --> 17:54.574
as you asking that man
to kill your son.

17:57.369 --> 18:01.081
Rex, right? Was that his name?

18:01.831 --> 18:03.833
What kind of weird fuckin' games
are you tryin' to play?

18:04.459 --> 18:07.252
Shut up. Shut up.
Just shut up.

18:07.253 --> 18:11.090
Your last night together
was going to be here,

18:11.091 --> 18:12.175
at this club.

18:13.051 --> 18:15.928
Right, Francis? Am I right?

18:15.929 --> 18:18.597
Was it over there?
Where you two danced?

18:18.598 --> 18:20.557
Is that where Oz made you
his promise?

18:20.558 --> 18:22.685
God damn it, stop.

18:22.686 --> 18:24.062
I just wanna know.

18:25.397 --> 18:27.314
- Was it worth it?
- Fuck you.

18:27.315 --> 18:29.024
Did he give you
everything that you wanted?

18:29.025 --> 18:32.027
- Did he fulfill his promise?
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

18:32.028 --> 18:32.946
Ma.

18:34.197 --> 18:35.114
Ma.

18:35.115 --> 18:36.824
Or do you wish
you would've let Rex

18:36.825 --> 18:38.576
take him for that ride?

18:41.329 --> 18:44.165
What did you lose
by keeping him alive?

18:45.625 --> 18:46.793
I know what I lost...

18:47.627 --> 18:49.004
what he took from me.

18:49.838 --> 18:53.216
He deserves to know
what he did to you,

18:54.092 --> 18:56.010
how you feel about him,

18:56.011 --> 18:59.347
and how... how angry you are.

19:01.766 --> 19:02.600
Tell him.

19:04.352 --> 19:05.270
Tell him.

19:09.024 --> 19:10.191
Yeah.

19:24.414 --> 19:25.248
Fine.

19:26.958 --> 19:27.792
Julian.

19:29.961 --> 19:30.962
What the fuck?

19:32.464 --> 19:33.298
What are you doin'?

19:33.965 --> 19:35.008
Stay away from her!

19:36.426 --> 19:38.761
Ma! Don't fuckin' touch her!

19:38.762 --> 19:41.722
Don't you fuckin' touch her!
Don't fuckin' touch her!

19:41.723 --> 19:44.516
- No! No!
- Oz, was it my brother's right

19:44.517 --> 19:46.852
or left pinky
that you chopped off?

19:46.853 --> 19:48.771
Jesus, no, Sofia!

19:48.772 --> 19:51.523
- It was the right.
- Hey! Don't fuckin' touch her!

19:51.524 --> 19:53.777
- Oswald!
- Don't fuckin' do it!

19:58.990 --> 20:00.032
- No! Jesus!
- Oswald!

20:00.033 --> 20:01.201
Here's the thing.

20:01.743 --> 20:04.203
Just because
somebody knows something,

20:04.204 --> 20:06.205
doesn't mean that
they don't need to hear it

20:06.206 --> 20:08.875
- from the person who hurt them.
- Don't. Sofia, don't.

20:09.000 --> 20:12.127
I will never get that
from my father.

20:12.128 --> 20:15.172
But I'm offering you
the opportunity

20:15.173 --> 20:16.298
to give it to your mother.

20:16.299 --> 20:17.758
No!

20:17.759 --> 20:19.259
She deserves the best.

20:19.260 --> 20:20.761
Doesn't she?

20:20.762 --> 20:23.347
- No! No!
- Oz, doesn't she?

20:23.348 --> 20:25.516
- So give her your best.
- Sofia, don't fuckin' do it!

20:25.517 --> 20:26.892
Just don't do it!
She did nothin'.

20:26.893 --> 20:27.935
It's very simple.

20:27.936 --> 20:30.188
All you have to do
is tell the truth.

20:30.689 --> 20:32.564
Tell her what you did
to your brothers,

20:32.565 --> 20:34.191
and tell her why,

20:34.192 --> 20:35.693
and then we can all
take a breath.

20:35.694 --> 20:38.113
This is fuckin' insane!

20:39.531 --> 20:41.699
I already told ya,
I didn't do fuckin' shit.

20:41.700 --> 20:43.659
I don't know what
you're fuckin' talkin' about.

20:43.660 --> 20:44.993
Oz!

20:44.994 --> 20:46.537
Don't! God damn it, don't!

20:46.538 --> 20:48.330
I did nothin'!
I wasn't even there!

20:48.331 --> 20:49.915
- She knows that. Stop!
- Admit it.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.750
I wasn't even with 'em.
I didn't do shit.

20:51.751 --> 20:53.794
- What is wrong with you?
- She knows. Ma!

20:53.795 --> 20:55.254
Just tell her for her sake.

20:55.255 --> 20:56.630
Tell her I was with you.

20:56.631 --> 20:58.298
It's my fuckin' finger,
you spineless prick!

20:58.299 --> 20:59.717
I was with you.

20:59.718 --> 21:02.136
Jesus, just say it. Tell her.

21:02.137 --> 21:04.139
I already fuckin' know.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.857
I know what you did
to Jack and Benny.

21:14.858 --> 21:16.776
I always known.

21:22.115 --> 21:23.116
Lies.

21:25.410 --> 21:26.870
You're gettin' things confused.

21:29.164 --> 21:30.998
It's just your disease talkin', Ma.

21:30.999 --> 21:32.083
Fuck you!

21:33.668 --> 21:35.753
I hate you. I hate you
for what you did.

21:35.754 --> 21:37.297
I never stopped hating you.

21:40.508 --> 21:41.509
That's enough.

21:50.101 --> 21:52.979
You woulda let me cut it off, huh?

21:55.315 --> 21:56.733
You woulda let me do it.

21:58.902 --> 22:00.402
Because you don't care
about her.

22:00.403 --> 22:01.738
- Fuck you.
- You don't.

22:02.697 --> 22:03.698
Not enough.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.159
Not like you say.

22:08.787 --> 22:10.663
You don't feel a fuckin' thing.

22:12.999 --> 22:14.125
Oswald.

22:16.169 --> 22:18.797
I had enough to give, Oswald.

22:20.799 --> 22:22.967
I had enough to give
all three of you.

22:24.969 --> 22:26.553
You didn't have to leave 'em
down there.

22:26.554 --> 22:28.431
You didn't have
to take 'em from me.

22:30.517 --> 22:32.227
They were my babies.

22:32.936 --> 22:34.104
My world.

22:35.563 --> 22:36.940
Your brothers.

22:50.161 --> 22:51.788
You're a disappointment.

22:53.415 --> 22:54.916
You're a waste of space.

22:56.334 --> 22:59.212
I wake up every goddamn day
sick that I'm your mother.

23:00.338 --> 23:01.381
She's right.

23:02.382 --> 23:03.717
She's fuckin' right.

23:05.552 --> 23:08.388
I shoulda let Rex kill ya
when I had the chance.

23:17.439 --> 23:18.356
You're the devil.

23:19.816 --> 23:21.234
You're the goddamn devil.

23:27.991 --> 23:28.908
Ma.

23:39.878 --> 23:40.920
Jack?

23:44.591 --> 23:45.508
Benny.

23:49.346 --> 23:50.597
My babies.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.351
I'm sorry.

23:55.352 --> 23:56.436
Ma.

24:00.273 --> 24:01.316
I'm sor--

24:06.071 --> 24:07.155
I'm...

24:10.784 --> 24:11.785
Ma!

24:12.994 --> 24:13.995
Ma!

24:14.662 --> 24:15.497
Stop him!

24:24.047 --> 24:25.256
Ma!

24:26.966 --> 24:28.927
Come on. I got you. I got you.

24:50.198 --> 24:51.241
You're gonna be all right.

25:07.048 --> 25:08.632
She just fell.
She just hit her head.

25:08.633 --> 25:09.925
She's not making sense.

25:09.926 --> 25:12.011
She's got this condition,
Lewy body,

25:12.012 --> 25:13.220
dementia-type thing.

25:13.221 --> 25:15.222
Ma, you're gonna be all right.
You hear me?

25:15.223 --> 25:16.807
Stay in the waiting room.
We'll find you.

25:16.808 --> 25:18.183
Gonna be able to fix her, right?

25:18.184 --> 25:20.185
We'll do everything we can, sir.

25:20.186 --> 25:21.563
Just stay nearby.

25:26.693 --> 25:28.152
<i>GC1 is live at the scene</i>

25:28.153 --> 25:29.611
<i>of chaos in downtown Gotham.</i>

25:29.612 --> 25:31.530
<i>Rescue workers pull bodies

25:31.531 --> 25:34.283

25:34.284 --> 25:36.369

25:46.671 --> 25:49.590
Oz, it's me again.
I'm worried, all right?

25:49.591 --> 25:51.885
Just call me back.
Please call me back.

25:59.559 --> 26:00.976
<i>Kid, where the hell are ya?</i>

26:00.977 --> 26:01.895
Oz!

26:06.107 --> 26:07.108
Fuck.

26:27.379 --> 26:28.504
Oz?

26:28.505 --> 26:30.589
In here. Shut the door, kid.

26:30.590 --> 26:31.841
Holy shit!

26:32.801 --> 26:34.636
What happened? Are you okay?

26:35.553 --> 26:36.512
Yeah.

26:36.513 --> 26:39.014
Sofia, you know, she stabbed me.

26:39.015 --> 26:40.557
She fucked with my ma too.

26:40.558 --> 26:43.353
Wh-wh-what did she do to her?

26:44.813 --> 26:47.773
Just, uh, pass me
one of those, um...

26:47.774 --> 26:49.818
yeah, patch, bandage thing.

26:52.404 --> 26:53.405
Fuck.

26:59.160 --> 27:01.204
Your mom, is she all right?

27:01.996 --> 27:02.997
Yeah, she will be.

27:04.624 --> 27:06.417
I'm sorry, Oz.

27:06.418 --> 27:09.129
I-I-I got there too late.

27:09.754 --> 27:12.298
I tried the gangs. I tried to...

27:13.049 --> 27:14.466
m-m-make 'em see,

27:14.467 --> 27:16.510
but they... they just left.

27:16.511 --> 27:17.637
It ain't you, Vic.

27:18.388 --> 27:19.222
It ain't you.

27:19.931 --> 27:21.016
Just the way it is.

27:21.683 --> 27:23.101
I got nothin' left
to offer 'em, so...

27:23.685 --> 27:24.769
That's not true.

27:25.687 --> 27:26.771
No. You're wrong.

27:27.272 --> 27:30.734
Oz, it's not just
about the... th-the drugs

27:31.401 --> 27:32.735
or-or the money.

27:32.736 --> 27:35.196
I mean, that's...
that's part of it, sure, but...

27:37.907 --> 27:39.075
I mean, guys like Link,

27:40.577 --> 27:42.202
h-he believes in you.

27:42.203 --> 27:43.371
- Link?
- Yes.

27:44.664 --> 27:46.499
Link's a fuckin' deputy, kid.

27:47.500 --> 27:48.751
Can't do shit
without the <i>Dai Lo.</i>

27:48.752 --> 27:51.212
God damn it, Oz, listen to me!

27:53.882 --> 27:56.134
You gave people jobs
in Crown Point.

27:58.219 --> 27:59.803
You got the power back on.

27:59.804 --> 28:01.056
Yeah.

28:02.349 --> 28:03.516
Nobody did that.

28:04.601 --> 28:06.936
All right? Nobody else did that.
Nobody even tried.

28:10.357 --> 28:11.900
You gave people dignity.

28:14.778 --> 28:17.947
Bliss? That's bigger than Bliss.
All right? So...

28:20.408 --> 28:22.076
G-get the hell up. Let's go.

28:22.077 --> 28:24.329
Get your shit together
and, uh...

28:26.081 --> 28:27.082
you know...

28:29.042 --> 28:29.876
be you.

28:32.796 --> 28:34.130
Y-you, uh...

28:36.341 --> 28:37.258
You practiced that, huh?

28:37.967 --> 28:38.801
Shut up.

28:38.802 --> 28:41.095
No, no, it's good. It's good.

28:41.096 --> 28:43.682
You gotta project more,
you know, from your gut.

28:45.975 --> 28:48.603
All right, let's get the fuck
outta here. Help me up.

28:50.146 --> 28:51.147
All right.

28:51.773 --> 28:54.025
Sofia's gonna be
expectin' a brawl.

28:54.901 --> 28:56.610
So we're gonna come
at her sideways, all right?

28:56.611 --> 28:57.904
What about your mom?

28:58.488 --> 29:02.033
She'll never look
at me again, all right?

29:02.826 --> 29:03.993
Unless I get this done.

29:06.204 --> 29:07.372
Got a promise to keep.

29:12.627 --> 29:15.504
Thank you for making the trip
across the bridge.

29:15.505 --> 29:16.798
I know it's a hike.

29:18.550 --> 29:22.011
This was my father's home.
And as you can imagine,

29:22.012 --> 29:26.307
a lot of... terrible shit
happened here.

29:26.850 --> 29:28.308
Now...

29:28.309 --> 29:30.478
What I wanna know is...

29:32.355 --> 29:33.523
Who wants it?

29:39.070 --> 29:41.614
I don't think we're quite clear
on what you're offering.

29:46.578 --> 29:47.871
I'm leaving Gotham,

29:48.455 --> 29:49.664
Mr. Zhao.

29:51.041 --> 29:52.625
There's nothing left
for me here.

29:54.461 --> 29:55.295
But my home,

29:56.421 --> 29:57.464
my territories,

29:58.214 --> 29:59.299
my businesses...

30:01.092 --> 30:02.135
can all be yours.

30:03.261 --> 30:04.929
Well, not all of yours.

30:06.056 --> 30:08.308
Whichever one of you
brings me Oz first.

30:09.809 --> 30:10.894
He's dead.

30:12.312 --> 30:13.355
He's not.

30:15.023 --> 30:16.900
I'm gonna make this very simple.

30:17.484 --> 30:20.403
Whoever finds Oz first

30:21.154 --> 30:24.324
can have all the means
to control Gotham...

30:24.991 --> 30:27.035
for as long
as they can hold onto it.

30:27.827 --> 30:28.870
This isn't real.

30:30.663 --> 30:31.706
Right?

30:32.415 --> 30:34.751
You want us to believe
you're gonna walk away from...

30:35.460 --> 30:36.461
all of this?

30:38.421 --> 30:39.381
Why would you do that?

30:41.341 --> 30:42.425
Because I can.

30:48.682 --> 30:49.849
So, who wants it?

30:51.976 --> 30:53.811
All right, you stay put.
Don't do anything

30:53.812 --> 30:55.980
that might call attention
to yourself, all right?

30:56.690 --> 30:58.607
We may have to get out of here
real quick.

30:58.608 --> 31:00.485
- Yeah.
- Here, put the gun in the glove.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.876
All right, how do I look?

31:20.922 --> 31:21.755
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

31:21.756 --> 31:23.298
Yeah, you look... It's good.

31:23.299 --> 31:25.342
- No blood, so...
- Yeah, good.

31:25.343 --> 31:27.553
Lookin' the part's
only half the thing, you know.

31:27.554 --> 31:28.847
- Mmm.
- All right.

31:29.973 --> 31:31.599
Into the fuckin' lion's den.

31:48.908 --> 31:50.326
- Link?
- Victor.

31:51.369 --> 31:52.537
You with Oz?

31:54.080 --> 31:55.081
Um...

31:57.250 --> 31:58.460
<i>I know he's alive.</i>

31:59.085 --> 32:00.587
Sofia just put a bounty
on his head.

32:01.713 --> 32:03.548
<i>Listen, you were right.</i>

32:04.132 --> 32:05.133
We gotta do something.

32:05.675 --> 32:06.926
But we gotta do it fast.

32:07.802 --> 32:09.679
<i>Come on. Tell me where you at.</i>

32:54.140 --> 32:55.266
Jesus Christ.

32:56.685 --> 32:58.978
What the fuck, Oswald?

32:59.604 --> 33:00.854
I did what you asked.

33:00.855 --> 33:02.482
If anybody sees me
in here with you, I'm--

33:04.359 --> 33:05.318
Fuck.

33:06.027 --> 33:06.903
It works.

33:09.239 --> 33:10.240
You, uh...

33:11.282 --> 33:13.034
come a little closer,
Councilman?

33:14.494 --> 33:15.953
Nice acoustics in here,

33:15.954 --> 33:18.873
but, you know,
I prefer not to shout.

33:20.375 --> 33:21.626
Come on. I don't bite.

33:22.252 --> 33:23.211
There you go.

33:24.379 --> 33:26.797
Listen, I never got the chance
to thank you for helping me out.

33:26.798 --> 33:28.924
Crown Point's prettier with lights.

33:28.925 --> 33:30.467
But they're, uh...

33:30.468 --> 33:32.928
They're pullin' bodies out
of the rubble down there now.

33:32.929 --> 33:34.305
It's fuckin' tragic.

33:35.473 --> 33:37.641
People are pointin' fingers,
you know.

33:37.642 --> 33:39.101
I mean, I guess
most of the fingers

33:39.102 --> 33:41.061
are gonna be pointed
at City Hall.

33:41.062 --> 33:43.939
"Fuck the man."
You know, that kinda shit.

33:43.940 --> 33:45.567
And if the voters want answers,

33:46.609 --> 33:48.153
sure would be nice
to have some, right?

33:48.737 --> 33:50.321
- Answers?
- Yeah.

33:50.905 --> 33:52.156
Like what kind of answers?

33:52.157 --> 33:53.616
Answers like the truth.

33:55.618 --> 33:57.911
Sofia Falcone, she sent
a car full of explosives

33:57.912 --> 33:59.663
into the tunnels under the city.

33:59.664 --> 34:00.622
Mm-hmm.

34:00.623 --> 34:02.125
The damn thing went boom.

34:03.335 --> 34:04.794
And why would she do that?

34:07.547 --> 34:08.673
Because...

34:10.633 --> 34:12.051
that hole in the ground
used to be

34:12.052 --> 34:13.845
the biggest drug lab in Gotham.

34:15.388 --> 34:17.807
Run by a real smart
motherfucker, too.

34:21.436 --> 34:22.771
Salvatore Maroni.

34:23.980 --> 34:26.607
He's pushin' a new street drug
called Bliss.

34:26.608 --> 34:29.319
And you know all this how?

34:30.278 --> 34:32.529
Listen, I try to stay out
of these kinds of things,

34:32.530 --> 34:34.490
all right? But the headline is:

34:34.491 --> 34:35.949
it's the same old war.

34:35.950 --> 34:37.785
The Maronis and Falcones
rippin' each other off.

34:37.786 --> 34:39.871
The Maronis kill
Sofia's brother.

34:40.455 --> 34:41.706
She goes full psycho.

34:42.457 --> 34:44.792
She burns Sal's wife and son
to a crisp,

34:44.793 --> 34:46.585
blows up
his entire fuckin' operation.

34:46.586 --> 34:48.671
I mean, what a girl!
I gotta give her some credit.

34:48.672 --> 34:50.715
- That's quite a story.
- Yeah.

34:51.216 --> 34:53.134
Is any of it true?

34:54.344 --> 34:55.844
Yeah, it's fuckin' true.

34:55.845 --> 34:57.179
When the cops dig
in that hole,

34:57.180 --> 34:58.555
you know what
they're gonna find?

34:58.556 --> 35:00.684
They're gonna find little pieces
of Sofia's G-Wagen

35:01.267 --> 35:03.894
and a bunch of dead Falcones
and Maronis...

35:03.895 --> 35:05.647
including Salvatore himself.

35:07.357 --> 35:10.068
It is what it looks like.

35:11.403 --> 35:12.278
You know that...

35:12.862 --> 35:14.030
your line of work.

35:14.989 --> 35:16.198
And this looks like

35:16.199 --> 35:18.367
an unhinged, angry broad
got out of the loony bin

35:18.368 --> 35:20.370
and went on
a fuckin' killing spree.

35:20.995 --> 35:24.081
But, Councilman, look,
you got an opportunity here

35:24.082 --> 35:25.667
to give the people
someone to hate...

35:28.128 --> 35:29.004
and...

35:31.881 --> 35:33.091
someone to love.

35:35.552 --> 35:37.970
Sebastian Hady, that's the guy

35:37.971 --> 35:39.973
who turned the lights back on
in Crown Point...

35:42.058 --> 35:43.601
restored people's dignity,

35:44.269 --> 35:46.937
locked up the last Falcone,
ended a fuckin' drug war

35:46.938 --> 35:50.066
that's plagued
these city streets for decades.

35:50.900 --> 35:51.985
How does that sound?

35:53.069 --> 35:54.236
Sounds nice.

35:54.237 --> 35:56.906
Nice?
You fuckin' piece of shit.

35:58.283 --> 35:59.742
That's the kind of win
that you can ride

35:59.743 --> 36:01.536
all the way to the top,
Councilman.

36:06.332 --> 36:07.751
And in return?

36:08.335 --> 36:09.502
In return...

36:12.839 --> 36:15.592
Might be good to feel welcome
in a place like this for a change.

36:16.676 --> 36:18.553
You know, meet some
of those friends you got.

36:19.512 --> 36:20.972
Hell, maybe, uh...

36:21.639 --> 36:23.725
one of these days,
we'll bump into Bella Reál.

36:24.476 --> 36:25.393
You know?

36:35.737 --> 36:38.573
You're gonna have
some trouble, Oz.

36:39.282 --> 36:42.118
Reál, she's forming
a commission, anti-corruption.

36:42.744 --> 36:44.871
They're going after cops,
city officials.

36:44.996 --> 36:46.163
- Good.
- And they have a list

36:46.164 --> 36:48.207
of Carmine's associates.

36:48.208 --> 36:50.168
They're gonna subpoena you.

36:53.046 --> 36:54.172
You wanna be welcome?

36:55.131 --> 36:56.216
You gotta look...

36:58.176 --> 36:59.135
clean.

37:00.595 --> 37:02.055
As a fuckin' whistle...

37:03.640 --> 37:04.474
pal.

37:25.704 --> 37:28.372
Mayor-Elect, what can
you tell us on Crown Point?

37:28.373 --> 37:32.251
Coordinating with GCPD.
All hospitals triaging.

37:32.252 --> 37:33.877
We're still searching
for survivors,

37:33.878 --> 37:35.629
but we need more resources.

37:35.630 --> 37:37.757
- Okay.
- I'm relying on it.

38:21.843 --> 38:22.802
Oz.

38:24.471 --> 38:25.347
The fuck's this?

38:29.768 --> 38:30.852
Get in.

39:05.637 --> 39:06.638
Mr. Zhao.

39:07.389 --> 39:08.223
<i>I have Oz.</i>

39:11.518 --> 39:13.143
- Fuckin' relax, Jesus!
- Come on.

39:13.144 --> 39:14.813
Should we bring him
to the house?

39:16.147 --> 39:17.315
Uh, I'm actually...

39:18.274 --> 39:20.150
packing up
the last of my things.

39:20.151 --> 39:22.903
Why don't I meet you
at Goodwin International?

39:22.904 --> 39:23.988
Hangar five.

39:27.158 --> 39:29.953
Congratulations, Mr. Zhao.

39:30.453 --> 39:31.454
<i>And to you.</i>

42:01.813 --> 42:02.647
Ma'am.

43:28.608 --> 43:30.985
Thank you, Mr. Zhao.

43:32.070 --> 43:33.654
Will you, uh, end things here

43:33.655 --> 43:35.739
or drop him over the Atlantic?

43:35.740 --> 43:37.242
See if the Penguin can fly?

43:48.503 --> 43:50.005
Zhao...

43:59.431 --> 44:00.682
Hand it over.

44:02.267 --> 44:03.143
Slow.

44:23.913 --> 44:25.832
What do ya say
you and me go for a drive?

44:39.929 --> 44:41.348
Just like old times, huh?

44:45.226 --> 44:46.353
Were you goin' somewhere?

44:51.441 --> 44:52.942
I was hoping to.

45:01.451 --> 45:03.244
What did you say
to get Link to turn?

45:07.207 --> 45:08.291
I'm sure you...

45:09.668 --> 45:11.085
promised him something.

45:11.086 --> 45:13.838
Yeah, yeah. What you
and the <i>Dai Lo</i> never would.

45:15.340 --> 45:16.174
A shot.

45:17.384 --> 45:18.968
A chance to be somebody.

45:21.221 --> 45:22.972
Link was tired
of being overlooked.

45:23.890 --> 45:25.183
He ain't the only one neither.

45:26.893 --> 45:28.977
<i>Years of being
brushed aside,</i>

45:28.978 --> 45:32.272
<i>laughed at, told to eat shit
and fuckin' like it.</i>

45:32.273 --> 45:33.233
It breaks ya.

45:34.651 --> 45:35.902
Makes ya wanna break
somebody else.

45:40.240 --> 45:42.826
Figured you woulda
understood that, you know,

45:43.326 --> 45:44.160
considerin'...

45:45.537 --> 45:47.663
But you... you and your kind,

45:47.664 --> 45:50.375
you're so busy fillin'
your own fuckin' plate.

45:51.209 --> 45:53.378
You don't see that
everyone around you is starvin'.

45:54.087 --> 45:55.587
You got no idea
what it feels like,

45:55.588 --> 45:57.131
born into nothin'.

45:57.132 --> 45:58.465
<i>Havin' to smile
at the person</i>

45:58.466 --> 45:59.592
<i>whose boot's on your neck.</i>

46:00.844 --> 46:03.220
<i>Hopin' one day,
they'll look down,</i>

46:03.221 --> 46:04.597
<i>see ya there, and just let up.</i>

46:07.017 --> 46:09.019
You know what people'll do
to push that down?

46:09.644 --> 46:11.311
They'll do fuckin' anything.

46:11.312 --> 46:13.273
Anything to push down
that feeling.

46:14.691 --> 46:16.109
You think
I don't understand that?

46:18.903 --> 46:19.738
Right.

46:24.242 --> 46:25.326
It doesn't matter.

46:30.373 --> 46:32.000
Oswald Cobb...

46:33.793 --> 46:36.129
man of the people.

46:37.213 --> 46:38.256
That's right.

46:39.341 --> 46:41.301
That's what you need
to believe, huh?

46:45.221 --> 46:46.181
Here we are.

47:26.721 --> 47:28.682
You don't wanna put your gun
to my back...

47:29.974 --> 47:31.350
make a big show of it?

47:31.351 --> 47:33.311
Nah. You ain't the type to run.

47:44.239 --> 47:45.323
How's your mom?

47:46.908 --> 47:48.493
Has she told you
she loves you yet?

47:53.081 --> 47:53.915
Turn around.

47:55.834 --> 47:56.835
You were right.

47:58.628 --> 48:00.046
I didn't see you.

48:01.297 --> 48:02.297
But she did.

48:02.298 --> 48:03.967
She knew it
from the very beginning.

48:05.802 --> 48:07.721
You have always been a monster.

48:11.016 --> 48:13.476
You're never gonna find peace,
you know that?

48:13.977 --> 48:15.228
A sick fuck like you.

48:18.356 --> 48:19.482
You're going to hell...

48:20.734 --> 48:21.651
sweetheart.

48:28.825 --> 48:30.118
I'll save you a seat.

49:25.590 --> 49:26.925
On the ground!

49:28.134 --> 49:30.011
Hands behind your back.

49:30.637 --> 49:31.471
Now!

49:42.565 --> 49:43.525
Get her up.

49:59.708 --> 50:01.583
There she is. You all right, Ma?

50:01.584 --> 50:03.086
Get some cups.

50:04.087 --> 50:06.964
Snuck you in a little whiskey
to celebrate.

50:06.965 --> 50:08.007
Fuckin' did it, Ma.

50:08.008 --> 50:09.883
Fuckin' beautiful.

50:09.884 --> 50:11.552
This is what I'm talkin' about.
Look.

50:11.553 --> 50:13.220
<i>...to the crooked politics</i>

50:13.221 --> 50:15.556
<i>that have allowed
wealthy elites</i>

50:15.557 --> 50:17.516
<i>like Sofia Falcone
to wreak havoc...</i>

50:17.517 --> 50:18.434
This is all me.

50:18.435 --> 50:19.601
<i>...on the hardworking people...</i>

50:19.602 --> 50:20.686
I fed him this bullshit.

50:20.687 --> 50:22.272
Look at him spittin' it out, Ma.

50:23.940 --> 50:24.899
What do you think?

50:26.568 --> 50:27.402
What do you...

50:29.029 --> 50:30.030
What do you think?

50:32.282 --> 50:33.116
Ma?

50:34.200 --> 50:36.536
<i>Thank you, Councilman Hady,
for your...</i>

50:36.661 --> 50:37.996
- Ma?
<i>- ...continued service.</i>

50:38.997 --> 50:39.956
Ma.

50:40.749 --> 50:41.750
Ma, look at me.

50:42.500 --> 50:43.585
Ma, look at me.

50:44.169 --> 50:45.003
Ma.

50:46.546 --> 50:47.380
Ma.

50:49.299 --> 50:51.134
- Oz...
- Jesus fuck!

50:51.968 --> 50:54.928
Help-- Vic, she needs some help.
Get somebody in here.

50:54.929 --> 50:57.182
Get a doctor in here.
Get a doctor!

50:59.434 --> 51:00.476
Ma, Ma, Ma, look at me.

51:00.477 --> 51:02.187
We need some help here.
Please!

51:02.729 --> 51:04.271
Hey, come here. Look at me, Ma.

51:04.272 --> 51:06.273
- Hey, hey! Help!
- Look at me, sweetheart.

51:06.274 --> 51:09.026
- Ma. Come on.
- Sir?

51:09.027 --> 51:10.944
There's somethin' wrong.
You gotta help.

51:10.945 --> 51:12.279
We've been looking for you

51:12.280 --> 51:13.572
but didn't know how
to reach you.

51:13.573 --> 51:14.949
Why aren't her eyes
fuckin' movin'?

51:16.451 --> 51:18.745
Your mother has suffered
a serious stroke.

51:23.500 --> 51:24.334
What?

51:25.418 --> 51:26.711
I'm so sorry.

51:28.713 --> 51:30.298
What... what's goin' on?

51:31.800 --> 51:33.550
I'm afraid
the stroke has left her

51:33.551 --> 51:35.844
in a persistent
vegetative state,

51:35.845 --> 51:38.639
and given your mother's age
and her Lewy body diagnosis--

51:38.640 --> 51:40.350
Whoa! What the fuck
you talkin' bout?

51:41.685 --> 51:43.937
You sayin'
she's a fuckin' vegetable?

51:45.021 --> 51:47.106
Her fuckin' eyes are open. Look!

51:47.107 --> 51:49.108
She's lookin'
at fuckin' somethin'.

51:49.109 --> 51:50.401
I'm so sorry.

51:50.402 --> 51:51.944
Stop sayin'
you're fuckin' sorry!

51:51.945 --> 51:53.570
- Sir--
- You're another fuckin' idiot.

51:53.571 --> 51:55.155
Get the doctors in here!

51:55.156 --> 51:58.493
Get the fuckin' doctors in here!
Get a fuckin' doctor in here!

52:22.726 --> 52:23.852
Come on, doll.

52:25.186 --> 52:26.104
Look at me.

52:29.357 --> 52:30.316
I did it.

52:32.235 --> 52:35.155
I took it all
from those pricks...

52:38.116 --> 52:39.117
like you said.

52:43.121 --> 52:44.539
I'm the fucking king.

52:52.380 --> 52:53.340
Fuck, Ma.

52:56.051 --> 52:57.677
Ma, don't do this to me.

53:01.598 --> 53:04.309
Ma, just don't do this
to me, all right?

53:06.186 --> 53:08.104
Ma, you can't do this to me,
please!

53:09.439 --> 53:11.775
You gotta tell me--
Just tell me you're proud of me.

53:12.901 --> 53:15.319
Ma, tell me
you're proud of me, please!

53:15.320 --> 53:17.571
Come on. Just once.
Just tell me you're proud of me.

53:17.572 --> 53:18.990
Tell me I did good!

53:20.492 --> 53:21.785
Tell me I did good!

53:23.578 --> 53:25.704
I did it for you, Ma!
I did it all for you,

53:25.705 --> 53:27.122
the whole thing!

53:27.123 --> 53:29.375
Your son, I'm the fucking king!

53:29.376 --> 53:30.794
It's what you wanted, Ma.

53:32.087 --> 53:33.171
It's what you wanted.

53:34.881 --> 53:37.884
Ma, please, just once...
Just once...

54:05.912 --> 54:07.205
Don't feel like it should.

54:09.916 --> 54:11.000
No.

54:11.001 --> 54:12.961
Don't know what happened.
She was fine.

54:21.594 --> 54:23.388
Everything I ever done
was for her.

54:27.308 --> 54:28.643
But in the end...

54:31.479 --> 54:32.355
I don't know.

54:35.108 --> 54:36.776
Sh-she knew that.

54:39.070 --> 54:40.071
She did.

54:42.991 --> 54:44.576
You think she forgives me?

54:45.827 --> 54:46.828
For what?

54:53.376 --> 54:54.377
I don't know.

54:55.587 --> 54:56.755
All kinds of things.

54:59.049 --> 55:00.925
None of this came easy,
you know.

55:04.054 --> 55:05.680
Can't stop thinkin' about 'em.

55:08.558 --> 55:10.184
My brothers.
What kinda men they'd be

55:10.185 --> 55:11.478
if they had the chance.

55:14.064 --> 55:15.273
What they'd think of me...

55:17.484 --> 55:18.485
now.

55:20.278 --> 55:21.654
Yeah, I th...

55:22.405 --> 55:23.573
I think about that too.

55:24.741 --> 55:26.201
My family...

55:28.411 --> 55:29.454
I miss 'em.

55:32.457 --> 55:34.834
Yeah, I r-- I really miss 'em.

55:35.960 --> 55:37.087
Yeah.

55:41.466 --> 55:43.093
Here, take the rest.

55:53.311 --> 55:55.855
You know I couldn't've done any
of this shit without ya, right?

55:57.107 --> 55:58.108
You know that?

55:59.275 --> 56:01.903
Bringin' Link into the fold,
I didn't see it at first, but...

56:03.363 --> 56:04.656
it was a smart move.

56:08.368 --> 56:09.661
You did good, kid.

56:12.122 --> 56:12.956
Thanks.

56:19.379 --> 56:20.880
And thanks for, uh...

56:22.841 --> 56:24.718
Thanks for taking a chance on me.

56:26.344 --> 56:27.345
F-f...

56:28.430 --> 56:30.140
For taking me in.

56:33.852 --> 56:34.978
You're like...

56:36.021 --> 56:37.063
You're f...

56:38.398 --> 56:39.607
You're f...

56:40.233 --> 56:41.568

56:42.277 --> 56:43.236
You know?

56:52.829 --> 56:53.913
Fuck.

56:59.878 --> 57:01.212
Fuck, Vic.

57:02.172 --> 57:03.214
You and me...

57:04.966 --> 57:06.343
it's all that's left.

57:11.139 --> 57:13.350
Now, I don't believe
in kismet or nothin'.

57:17.354 --> 57:18.355
But...

57:19.647 --> 57:20.815
It's good that we met.

57:21.399 --> 57:22.817
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

57:23.693 --> 57:26.404
You've seen me at my lowest,
all this shit with my ma.

57:28.198 --> 57:29.324
You've been there...

57:31.743 --> 57:33.703
by my side, every fuckin' step.

57:36.706 --> 57:37.957
But listen, kid.

57:40.627 --> 57:41.711
I, uh...

57:44.381 --> 57:46.216
I can't bring you with me
this time.

57:48.510 --> 57:49.594
What do you mean?

57:50.428 --> 57:52.472
I mean, that's the thing
about family.

57:53.139 --> 57:54.140
Oz...

57:54.974 --> 57:56.975
- It's your strength.
- Oz, what are you--

57:56.976 --> 57:58.061
It drives you.

57:58.937 --> 58:00.979
But fuck if it don't
make ya weak, too.

58:00.980 --> 58:02.482
Oz! Oz!

58:03.191 --> 58:04.858
And I can't have that no more.

58:04.859 --> 58:05.944
Oz...

58:07.570 --> 58:08.404
Please... Please...

58:08.405 --> 58:09.863
I can't have that shit. I can't.

58:09.864 --> 58:11.573
Please... Please...

58:11.574 --> 58:13.992

58:13.993 --> 58:16.037

58:27.841 --> 58:30.468
I'm sorry.
You're a good man, Vic.

58:31.344 --> 58:32.470
You got a good heart.

58:44.524 --> 58:45.900
It wasn't for nothin'.

01:00:23.331 --> 01:00:24.833
I brought your mail.

01:00:33.258 --> 01:00:34.592
Mostly the usual.

01:00:36.052 --> 01:00:37.345
Rants, poems,

01:00:38.138 --> 01:00:39.222
marriage proposals.

01:00:43.518 --> 01:00:44.686
This one's different.

01:00:46.396 --> 01:00:47.564
I think you should read it.

01:00:50.608 --> 01:00:52.652
It's from a woman
named Selina Kyle.

01:00:55.989 --> 01:00:57.824
She says she's your half-sister.

01:01:03.288 --> 01:01:04.122
Sofia?

01:02:55.316 --> 01:02:56.651
How we doin' today?

01:02:58.278 --> 01:02:59.529
You feelin' any better?

01:03:00.196 --> 01:03:01.448
You look better.

01:03:17.881 --> 01:03:19.132
I know.

01:03:21.593 --> 01:03:22.844
It's everything you wanted.

01:03:51.748 --> 01:03:52.874
There she is.

01:03:54.334 --> 01:03:55.460
Oswald.

01:04:01.925 --> 01:04:03.009
You look beautiful.

01:04:04.678 --> 01:04:06.221
Dance with me, sweetheart.

01:04:27.742 --> 01:04:29.119
Tell me you love me.

01:04:30.453 --> 01:04:32.455
I love you, Oswald.

01:04:35.792 --> 01:04:37.210
Tell me you're proud of me.

01:04:37.836 --> 01:04:40.963
I'm so proud of you.

01:04:40.964 --> 01:04:42.257
I did it, Ma.

01:04:43.550 --> 01:04:44.509
Didn't I?

01:04:46.094 --> 01:04:47.136
Tell me I did it.

01:04:47.137 --> 01:04:49.138
You did it. Mm-hmm.

01:04:49.139 --> 01:04:51.683
Top floor, penthouse.

01:04:52.517 --> 01:04:54.352
No one above ya or beside ya.

01:04:55.020 --> 01:04:56.479
I knew you would.

01:04:57.772 --> 01:04:59.691
My beautiful boy.

01:05:04.195 --> 01:05:05.989
Gotham's yours, sweetheart.

01:05:08.867 --> 01:05:10.952
Nothin' is standin'
in your way now.

01:05:12.037 --> 01:05:13.288
God damn right.
