WEBVTT

02:23.148 --> 02:25.192
Will!

02:25.692 --> 02:28.696
-Why is this happening?
-I don't know.

02:30.031 --> 02:32.158
You look beautiful.

02:33.660 --> 02:36.914
It's bad luck for the groom
to see the bride before the wedding.

02:37.039 --> 02:40.292
Make way! Let me through!
How dare you!

02:40.417 --> 02:43.921
Stand your men down at once.
Do you hear me?

02:45.297 --> 02:48.218
Governor Weatherby Swann,
it's been too long.

02:48.301 --> 02:51.888
-Cutler Beckett?
-It's Lord now, actually.

02:53.598 --> 02:58.896
Lord or not, you have no reason
and no authority to arrest this man.

02:59.313 --> 03:01.941
In fact, I do. Mr. Mercer?

03:04.319 --> 03:07.906
The warrant for the arrest
of one William Turner.

03:12.912 --> 03:17.458
-This warrant is for Elizabeth Swann.
-Oh, is it? That's annoying. My mistake.

03:17.584 --> 03:19.961
-Arrest her.
-On what charges?

03:20.086 --> 03:23.757
Aha. Here's the one for William Turner.

03:23.841 --> 03:27.970
And I have another one
for a Mr. James Norrington.

03:28.053 --> 03:30.182
-Is he present?
-What are the charges?

03:30.307 --> 03:33.977
Commodore Norrington resigned
his commission some months ago.

03:34.102 --> 03:36.480
That wasn't the answer
to the question I asked.

03:36.605 --> 03:40.276
Lord Beckett. In the category
of questions not answered...

03:40.359 --> 03:43.779
We are under the jurisdiction
of the king's governor of Port Royal

03:43.905 --> 03:46.699
and you will tell us
what we are charged with.

03:46.782 --> 03:50.037
The charge is conspiring to set
free...

03:50.120 --> 03:53.790
a man convicted of crimes
against the Crown and Empire

03:53.916 --> 03:57.670
and condemned to death,
for which the...

03:57.795 --> 04:01.466
For which the punishment,
regrettably, is also death.

04:03.968 --> 04:07.056
Perhaps you remember a certain pirate
named Jack Sparrow.

04:07.181 --> 04:09.141
Captain.

04:10.434 --> 04:12.978
Captain Jack Sparrow.

04:13.229 --> 04:15.982
Captain Jack Sparrow.

04:16.065 --> 04:18.276
Yes, I thought you might.

04:20.070 --> 04:25.284
Fifteen men
on a dead man's chest

04:25.409 --> 04:30.206
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

04:30.331 --> 04:35.671
Drink and the devil
had done for the rest

04:35.754 --> 04:40.384
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum

05:03.034 --> 05:05.162
Prisoners, come on!

06:43.271 --> 06:45.315
Sorry, mate.

06:47.442 --> 06:50.612
Mind if we make a little side trip?

06:51.446 --> 06:53.741
I didn't think so.

06:59.956 --> 07:03.878
-Not quite according to plan.
-Complications arose, ensued,

07:03.961 --> 07:06.005
were overcome.

07:07.423 --> 07:10.843
-You got what you went in for, then?

07:13.221 --> 07:16.391
Captain, I think the crew,
meaning me as well,

07:16.474 --> 07:19.811
were expecting something
a bit more... shiny,

07:19.936 --> 07:24.150
with the Isla de Muerta going pear-shaped,
reclaimed by the sea with the treasure.

07:24.233 --> 07:26.777
And the Royal Navy chasing us
around the Atlantic.

07:26.861 --> 07:29.573
-And the hurricane.
-Aye.

07:29.656 --> 07:35.412
All in all, it seems some time
since we did a speck of honest pirating.

07:36.622 --> 07:39.542
-Shiny.
-Aye, shiny.

07:40.668 --> 07:42.629
Is that how you're all feeling?

07:42.754 --> 07:48.093
That perhaps dear old Jack is not serving
your best interests as captain?

07:48.177 --> 07:50.471
Walk the plank.

07:50.596 --> 07:53.599
-What did the bird say?
-Do not blame the bird.

07:53.682 --> 07:57.020
Show us what is on
that piece of cloth there.

08:05.196 --> 08:08.783
-You know that don't do no good.
- It does me.

08:10.743 --> 08:14.081
-It's a key.
-No. Much more better.

08:15.249 --> 08:18.085
It is a drawing of a key.

08:24.467 --> 08:26.344
Gentlemen,

08:26.469 --> 08:28.346
what do keys do?

08:29.389 --> 08:31.267
Keys...

08:31.350 --> 08:33.727
unlock things?

08:33.811 --> 08:37.648
And whatever this key unlocks,
inside there's something valuable.

08:37.731 --> 08:40.986
So we're setting out to find
whatever this key unlocks.

08:41.068 --> 08:42.696
No.

08:43.238 --> 08:47.158
If we don't have the key, we can't open
whatever we don't have that it unlocks.

08:47.242 --> 08:51.080
So what purpose would be served
in finding whatever need be unlocked,

08:51.205 --> 08:55.668
which we don't have, without first
having found the key what unlocks it?

08:55.751 --> 08:58.046
So we're going after this key.

08:59.006 --> 09:01.466
You're not making any sense at all.

09:02.009 --> 09:03.969
Any more questions?

09:04.052 --> 09:06.598
So... do we have a heading?

09:06.681 --> 09:08.808
Ha. A heading.

09:11.102 --> 09:13.229
Set sail in a...

09:14.314 --> 09:16.275
general...

09:21.030 --> 09:22.907
that-way direction.

09:22.990 --> 09:24.159
Captain?

09:24.242 --> 09:28.955
Come on, snap to and make sail. You
know how this works. Go on. Oi, oi, oi!

09:32.500 --> 09:34.795
Have you noticed lately

09:34.921 --> 09:39.550
the captain seems to be acting
a bit strange... er?

09:39.634 --> 09:42.429
Setting sail without knowing
his own heading.

09:42.512 --> 09:45.516
Something's got Jack vexed,
and mark my words,

09:45.599 --> 09:49.436
what bodes ill for Jack Sparrow
bodes ill for us all.

10:03.744 --> 10:06.205
Lord Beckett,
the prisoner as ordered, sir.

10:06.330 --> 10:08.625
Those won't be necessary.

10:12.379 --> 10:17.175
The East India Trading Company
has need of your services.

10:21.222 --> 10:23.266
We wish for you to act as our agent

10:23.349 --> 10:27.479
in a business transaction
with our mutual friend Captain Sparrow.

10:27.563 --> 10:29.940
More acquaintance.
How do you know him?

10:30.023 --> 10:32.985
We've had dealings in the past.

10:33.861 --> 10:37.532
And we've each
left our mark on the other.

10:37.657 --> 10:40.034
What mark did he leave on you?

10:42.620 --> 10:46.458
By your efforts,
Jack Sparrow was set free.

10:46.542 --> 10:48.586
I would like you to go to him

10:48.669 --> 10:53.216
and recover a certain property
in his possession.

10:53.300 --> 10:56.052
Recover. At the point of a sword?

10:56.636 --> 10:58.597
Bargain.

11:04.896 --> 11:07.023
Letters of marque.

11:08.316 --> 11:10.861
You will offer
what amounts to a full pardon.

11:10.986 --> 11:15.240
Jack will be free,
a privateer in the employ of England.

11:15.949 --> 11:20.747
Somehow I doubt Jack will consider
employment the same as being free.

11:20.872 --> 11:22.916
Freedom.

11:23.875 --> 11:27.212
Jack Sparrow is a dying breed.

11:27.337 --> 11:29.215
The world is shrinking,

11:29.298 --> 11:32.718
the blank edges of the map filled in.

11:32.801 --> 11:36.639
Jack must find his place
in the New World or perish.

11:36.764 --> 11:39.559
Not unlike you, Mr. Turner.

11:39.643 --> 11:42.479
You and your fiancÃ©e
face the hangman's noose.

11:43.188 --> 11:47.902
-So you get Jack and the Black Pearl.
-The Black Pearl?

11:48.027 --> 11:52.240
-The property you want that he possesses.
-A ship? Hardly.

11:52.323 --> 11:56.411
The item in question is considerably
smaller and far more valuable,

11:56.495 --> 12:00.082
something Sparrow keeps
on his person at all times.

12:00.165 --> 12:02.793
A compass?

12:02.876 --> 12:05.004
Ah, you know it.

12:06.381 --> 12:10.760
Bring back that compass
or there's no deal.

12:36.163 --> 12:38.457
Why is the rum always gone?

12:44.464 --> 12:46.925
Oh.

12:47.050 --> 12:49.596
That's why.

12:55.643 --> 12:57.605
As you were, gents.

13:28.847 --> 13:30.807
Ah.

13:32.810 --> 13:34.687
Time's run out, Jack.

13:53.250 --> 13:55.877
Bootstrap.

13:55.961 --> 13:58.088
Bill Turner.

14:02.885 --> 14:05.263
You look good, Jack.

14:12.020 --> 14:14.231
Is this a dream?

14:14.314 --> 14:15.732
No.

14:15.816 --> 14:19.404
I thought not.
If it were, there'd be rum.

14:27.288 --> 14:29.748
You got the Pearl back, I see.

14:30.499 --> 14:34.336
I had some help retrieving the Pearl,
by the way.

14:35.463 --> 14:37.924
Your son.

14:38.049 --> 14:40.510
William?

14:41.261 --> 14:43.639
He ended up a pirate after all.

14:44.515 --> 14:48.436
And to what do I owe
the pleasure of your carbuncle?

14:48.561 --> 14:50.688
He sent me.

14:52.064 --> 14:54.735
Davy Jones.

14:54.818 --> 14:57.362
Oh.

14:57.487 --> 14:59.448
So it's you, then.

15:01.075 --> 15:04.412
He shanghaied you
into service, eh?

15:04.495 --> 15:06.456
I chose it.

15:06.581 --> 15:11.545
I'm sorry for the part I played
in the mutiny against you, Jack.

15:12.379 --> 15:14.924
I stood up for you.

15:15.007 --> 15:17.927
Everything went wrong after that.

15:19.596 --> 15:24.392
They strapped me to a cannon.
I ended up on the bottom of the ocean,

15:24.517 --> 15:27.437
the weight of the water
crushing down on me.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.066
Unable to move.

15:31.025 --> 15:33.402
Unable to die, Jack.

15:33.486 --> 15:39.076
And I thought that even the tiniest hope
of escaping this fate, I would take it.

15:39.660 --> 15:41.870
I would trade anything for it.

15:43.997 --> 15:47.168
It's funny what a man will do
to forestall his final judgment.

15:47.293 --> 15:49.963
You made a deal with him too, Jack.

15:50.046 --> 15:52.674
He raised the Pearl
from the depths for you.

15:52.757 --> 15:54.802
13 years, you've been her captain.

15:54.927 --> 15:56.804
-Technically...
-Jack.

15:56.929 --> 15:59.306
You won't be able
to talk yourself out of this.

15:59.431 --> 16:02.184
The terms what applied to me
apply to you as well.

16:02.268 --> 16:06.565
One soul bound to crew
100 years upon his ship.

16:06.690 --> 16:09.067
The Flying Dutchman
already has a captain...

16:09.192 --> 16:11.486
Then it's the locker for you!

16:11.611 --> 16:14.782
Jones's terrible leviathan will find you

16:14.907 --> 16:19.203
and drag the Pearl back to the depths
and you along with it.

16:20.162 --> 16:24.710
Any idea when Jones might release
said terrible beastie?

16:25.711 --> 16:27.588
I already told you, Jack.

16:29.590 --> 16:31.884
Your time is up.

16:32.802 --> 16:34.846
It comes now,

16:34.929 --> 16:40.269
drawn with ravenous hunger
to the man what bears the black spot.

16:49.404 --> 16:52.657
On deck, all hands!
Make fast the bunt gasket!

16:52.741 --> 16:55.035
On deck! Scurry!

16:55.118 --> 16:59.665
Scurry! I want movement!
Movement! I want movement!

16:59.790 --> 17:03.544
Lift the skin up! Keep your loof!
Haul those sheets!

17:03.628 --> 17:08.008
Run them! Run! Keep running! Run as if
the devil himself and itself is upon us!

17:08.133 --> 17:11.470
-Do we have a heading?
-Run! Land.

17:16.643 --> 17:20.313
-Which port?
-I didn't say "port", I said "land". Any land.

17:26.737 --> 17:29.907
-Jack's hat! Bring her about!
- No, no!

17:30.032 --> 17:32.327
Leave it!

17:32.953 --> 17:35.413
Run.

17:36.289 --> 17:39.376
Back to your stations,
the lot of you!

17:47.927 --> 17:49.554
-Jack?

17:49.680 --> 17:55.102
For the love of mother and child, Jack,
what's coming after us?

17:55.227 --> 17:56.937
Nothing.

19:10.353 --> 19:14.565
-Here, now, you can't be here.
-I think you'll find he can.

19:14.690 --> 19:16.150
Mr. Swann!

19:16.233 --> 19:18.278
Governor Swann, still.

19:18.403 --> 19:21.657
Do you think I wear this wig
to keep my head warm?

19:21.740 --> 19:25.327
Jack's compass?
What does Beckett want with that?

19:25.452 --> 19:29.624
Does it matter? I'm to find Jack
and convince him to return to Port Royal.

19:29.707 --> 19:32.252
In exchange, the charges
against us will be dropped.

19:32.335 --> 19:36.006
No. We must find our own avenue
to secure your freedom.

19:36.090 --> 19:38.634
Is that a lack of faith in Jack
or in me?

19:38.717 --> 19:41.011
That you would risk your life
to save Sparrow

19:41.095 --> 19:45.016
does not mean
he would do the same for anyone else.

19:45.100 --> 19:48.520
Now, where is that dog with the keys?

19:50.021 --> 19:52.565
I have faith in you.

19:52.649 --> 19:55.278
Both of you.

19:56.779 --> 19:59.490
Where will you find him?

19:59.573 --> 20:04.288
Tortuga. I'll start there
and I won't stop searching till I find him.

20:04.746 --> 20:08.166
And then I intend to return here
to marry you.

20:08.250 --> 20:11.588
-Properly?
-Eagerly, if you'll still have me.

20:12.672 --> 20:16.718
If it weren't for these bars,
I'd have you already.

20:23.183 --> 20:27.730
-I'll wait for you.
-Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

20:37.198 --> 20:39.327
Captain Jack Sparrow?

20:40.411 --> 20:44.790
Owes me four doubloons.
Heard he was dead.

20:44.574 --> 20:48.412
Singapore. That's what I heard.
Drunk, with a smile on his face.

20:48.495 --> 20:52.875
Sure as the tide,
Jack Sparrow turn up in Singapore.

20:52.958 --> 20:54.918
Jack Sparrow?

20:55.044 --> 20:57.088
I haven't seen him in a month.

20:57.213 --> 21:00.967
When you find him,
will you give him a message?

21:02.052 --> 21:04.597
Can't say about Jack Sparrow,

21:04.680 --> 21:07.350
but there's an island
just south of the straits

21:07.433 --> 21:09.727
where I trade spice for...

21:09.852 --> 21:12.480
mm, delicious long pork.

21:14.107 --> 21:18.153
Cannot say about Jack,
but you'll find a ship there.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.572
A ship with black sails.

21:28.081 --> 21:29.958
My brother will take you ashore.

21:40.804 --> 21:43.765
-What's wrong? The beach is there.
-C'est trop dangereux.

21:43.848 --> 21:47.268
-What?
-C'est trop dangereux, je vous l'avais dit.

21:48.771 --> 21:50.815
Bon voyage, monsieur.

22:15.801 --> 22:18.262
Jack!

22:18.387 --> 22:20.347
Jack Sparrow!

22:26.313 --> 22:28.273
Marty!

22:29.149 --> 22:30.859
Cotton!

22:31.860 --> 22:33.821
Anybody?

22:39.160 --> 22:41.788
-Ah. A familiar face.

22:41.872 --> 22:43.665
Don't eat me.

22:43.749 --> 22:46.752
-I'm not going to eat you.
-Don't eat me.

22:46.835 --> 22:49.379
No. Don't eat me.

23:00.351 --> 23:02.311
Gibbs.

23:32.594 --> 23:34.638
Come on! Let's go!

23:37.684 --> 23:39.560
Come on! Who wants it?

23:42.397 --> 23:44.692
I can do this all day!

24:49.096 --> 24:50.639
Jack?

24:50.723 --> 24:53.100
Jack Sparrow!

24:53.225 --> 24:55.771
I can honestly say
I'm glad to see you.

25:04.572 --> 25:06.532
Jack, it's me.

25:06.616 --> 25:07.867
Will Turner.

25:14.541 --> 25:18.212
-Tell them to let me down!

25:19.004 --> 25:20.964
...eensy-weensy.

25:27.055 --> 25:30.893
...eunuchy. Snip, snip.

25:31.018 --> 25:33.229
Eunuchy.

25:36.107 --> 25:38.567
Jack, the compass.
That's all I need.

25:38.651 --> 25:41.738
Elizabeth is in danger.
We were arrested for helping you.

25:41.822 --> 25:44.116
She faces the gallows!

25:51.791 --> 25:53.584
Savvy?

25:59.883 --> 26:02.261
Save me.

26:02.386 --> 26:04.430
Jack, what did you tell them?

26:04.555 --> 26:06.599
No!

26:07.017 --> 26:09.310
What about Elizabeth?

26:09.394 --> 26:10.979
Jack!

26:11.062 --> 26:16.027
That's a good girl.
Come a little closer.

26:16.152 --> 26:20.531
-We don't bite.
-Go on. We won't bite you.

26:23.034 --> 26:25.579
Come quickly.

26:25.704 --> 26:28.957
-Tell me what's happening.
-Our name still has some standing.

26:29.082 --> 26:32.420
I've arranged passage to England.
The captain is a friend of mine.

26:32.503 --> 26:34.630
No! Will's gone to find Jack!

26:34.756 --> 26:36.799
We cannot count on William Turner.

26:36.883 --> 26:40.053
-Come!
-He's better than you give him credit for.

26:40.136 --> 26:43.557
This is no time for innocence.
Beckett has offered one pardon only -

26:43.640 --> 26:45.934
one, and that is promised
to Jack Sparrow.

26:46.060 --> 26:47.770
Even if Will succeeds,

26:47.853 --> 26:53.943
do not ask me to endure the sight of my
daughter walking to the gallows. Do not.

26:54.027 --> 26:58.406
Perhaps I can ensure a fair trial
for Will if he returns.

26:58.531 --> 27:03.579
-A fair trial for Will ends in a hanging.
-Then there is nothing left for you here.

27:10.754 --> 27:12.881
Wait inside.

27:14.007 --> 27:15.967
Captain?

27:18.513 --> 27:20.473
Captain.

27:26.313 --> 27:28.607
Evening, Governor.

27:28.732 --> 27:30.693
Shame, that.

27:30.818 --> 27:32.945
He was carrying this.

27:33.028 --> 27:35.740
It's a letter to the king.

27:35.824 --> 27:38.118
-It's from you.
-No...

27:41.538 --> 27:43.749
Elizabeth.

27:44.458 --> 27:46.836
What are you doing?

27:49.547 --> 27:52.009
-Where is she?
-Who?

28:09.778 --> 28:13.991
No doubt you've discovered that loyalty
is no longer the currency of the realm,

28:14.074 --> 28:16.368
as your father believes.

28:17.161 --> 28:19.831
Then what is?

28:19.914 --> 28:23.168
I'm afraid currency
is the currency of the realm.

28:23.251 --> 28:28.549
I expect, then, we can come
to some sort of understanding.

28:28.632 --> 28:31.802
-I'm here to negotiate.
-I'm listening.

28:34.388 --> 28:36.683
I'm listening intently.

28:38.560 --> 28:40.937
These letters of marque
are signed by the king.

28:41.063 --> 28:45.777
Yes, and they're not valid
until they bear my signature and my seal.

28:45.902 --> 28:48.613
Or else I would not still be here.

28:48.696 --> 28:52.742
You sent Will to get you the compass
owned by Jack Sparrow.

28:52.825 --> 28:56.497
-It will do you no good.
-Do explain.

28:56.622 --> 29:01.418
I have been to the Isla de Muerta.
I have seen the treasure myself.

29:01.502 --> 29:03.546
There is something
you need to know.

29:03.672 --> 29:05.715
Ah, I see.

29:05.840 --> 29:08.927
You think the compass
leads only to the Isla de Muerta

29:09.052 --> 29:12.223
and so you hope to save me
from an evil fate.

29:12.932 --> 29:15.393
But you mustn't worry.

29:15.935 --> 29:19.271
I care not for cursed Aztec gold.

29:19.397 --> 29:21.858
My desires are not so provincial.

29:22.609 --> 29:26.905
There's more than one chest of value
in these waters.

29:28.156 --> 29:32.203
So perhaps you may wish
to enhance your offer.

29:34.664 --> 29:39.545
Consider into your calculations
that you robbed me of my wedding night.

29:39.628 --> 29:41.755
So I did.

29:43.716 --> 29:46.010
A marriage interrupted...

29:48.346 --> 29:51.057
or fate intervenes?

29:51.766 --> 29:55.020
You're making great efforts
to ensure Jack Sparrow's freedom.

29:55.145 --> 29:57.690
-These aren't going to Jack.
-Oh, really?

29:57.773 --> 30:00.526
To ensure Mr. Turner's freedom, then,

30:01.402 --> 30:04.155
I'll still want that compass.

30:04.238 --> 30:07.826
Consider that in your calculations.

30:27.473 --> 30:30.559
I say it was Divine Providence
what escaped us from jail.

30:30.642 --> 30:33.355
And I say it was me being clever.

30:34.606 --> 30:37.150
Ain't that right, poochie?

30:37.275 --> 30:41.447
Well, how'd you know it weren't Divine
Providence what inspired you to be clever?

30:41.530 --> 30:43.657
Anyways, I ain't stealing no ship.

30:43.783 --> 30:49.081
It ain't stealing. It's salvaging.
And since when did you care?

30:49.164 --> 30:53.794
Since we're not immortal no more.
We gotta take care of our immortal souls.

30:53.877 --> 30:57.631
-You know you can't read.
-It's the Bible. You get credit for trying.

30:57.756 --> 31:03.221
Pretending to read the Bible's a lie.
That's a mark against...

31:05.098 --> 31:06.809
Look.

31:06.892 --> 31:08.936
There it is.

31:13.649 --> 31:15.694
What's got into him?

31:15.777 --> 31:17.904
Must have seen a catfish.

31:25.079 --> 31:27.206
Stupid mongrel!

31:33.964 --> 31:35.924
Argh!

31:43.099 --> 31:44.726
Come on!

31:52.192 --> 31:56.447
-It's ours for the taking.
-Tide's coming in. That should help.

31:56.530 --> 31:59.283
And salvaging is saving,
in a manner of speaking.

31:59.408 --> 32:01.286
There's the truth of it!

32:08.836 --> 32:11.839
Suppose we better save it
as soon as we can,

32:11.922 --> 32:15.092
what with our souls
in such a vulnerable state and all.

32:15.217 --> 32:17.888
Amen to that.

32:34.072 --> 32:36.116
Thank you.

32:52.967 --> 32:56.222
Why would he do this to us?
If Jack is the chief...

32:56.347 --> 32:58.808
Aye, the Pelegostos
made Jack their chief,

32:58.891 --> 33:02.479
but he only remains chief
as long as he acts like a chief.

33:02.562 --> 33:05.649
So he had no choice.
He's a captive as much as the rest of us.

33:05.774 --> 33:12.490
Worse, as it turns out. See, the Pelegostos
believe that Jack is a god in human form,

33:12.573 --> 33:18.663
and they intend to do him the honor
of releasing him from his fleshy prison.

33:22.209 --> 33:24.670
They'll roast him and eat him.

33:25.713 --> 33:27.506
Where's the rest of the crew?

33:27.589 --> 33:32.137
These cages we're in
weren't built till after we got here.

33:34.472 --> 33:36.683
The feast is about to begin.

33:37.267 --> 33:39.478
Jack's life will end

33:39.562 --> 33:41.856
when the drums stop.

33:43.607 --> 33:46.235
Well, we can't just sit here and wait,
then, can we?

33:48.655 --> 33:51.324
No, no. Oi! No, no.

33:51.408 --> 33:54.494
More wood. Big fire. Big fire.

33:54.619 --> 33:56.748
I am Chief. Want big fire.

33:56.831 --> 33:59.042
Come on.

33:59.834 --> 34:02.462
Oi.
Tout de suite.

34:02.545 --> 34:04.840
Come on. More wood.

35:13.332 --> 35:15.293
Oh, bugger.

35:25.012 --> 35:27.140
A little seasoning, eh?

35:40.988 --> 35:42.615
Well done.

36:21.950 --> 36:25.287
Put your legs through.
Start to climb!

36:26.372 --> 36:30.502
Come on, men!
It'll take all of us to crew the Black Pearl!

36:30.627 --> 36:33.379
Actually, you wouldn't need everyone.

36:33.463 --> 36:35.758
About six would do.

36:39.387 --> 36:41.180
Oh, dear.

36:44.643 --> 36:47.312
-Hurry!
-Come on!

36:51.066 --> 36:53.444
Come on! Is that all you got?

37:01.119 --> 37:03.664
-Wait. Stop.

37:04.164 --> 37:06.458
Stop.

37:18.555 --> 37:20.933
- What are they doing?
-Stop.

37:27.690 --> 37:30.235
-Snake!

37:46.879 --> 37:48.672
Move!

38:14.910 --> 38:18.246
Well, go on, go get them.

38:22.668 --> 38:24.879
No, no. Oi! No, no!

38:27.256 --> 38:28.883
Not good.

38:45.193 --> 38:47.404
Cut it loose! Find a rock!

39:06.426 --> 39:08.219
Roll the cage!

39:08.302 --> 39:10.680
Come on!

39:35.207 --> 39:40.171
-Lift the cage! Hurry!
-Come on, lads. Lift it like a lady's skirt.

40:36.359 --> 40:37.735
Run!

40:51.458 --> 40:54.212
This way, lads!

41:16.736 --> 41:18.280
Take cover!

41:19.449 --> 41:20.992
Stop it!

42:16.053 --> 42:17.429
Bugger.

42:45.085 --> 42:47.755
Haul loose the mooring line!

42:47.839 --> 42:50.049
The mooring line!

42:50.174 --> 42:53.845
Thief! Little hairy thief!
Give it back!

42:53.928 --> 42:57.266
-Don't bite it!
- Haul loose the mooring line!

42:57.766 --> 42:59.893
He's got me eye.
He won't give it back.

42:59.977 --> 43:03.397
-How'd you get it back last time?
-Excellent! Our work's half done.

43:03.522 --> 43:05.984
We done it for you,
knowing you'd be coming back.

43:06.109 --> 43:09.028
-Make ready to sail, boys!
-What about Jack?

43:09.112 --> 43:12.449
-I won't leave without him.
- Oi!

43:20.583 --> 43:23.587
-Time to go.
-Cast off those lines!

43:32.346 --> 43:35.349
-Make ready to cast off!
-Oi!

43:38.895 --> 43:41.273
Good doggy.

43:56.664 --> 44:03.005
Alas, my children, this is the day you shall
always remember as the day you almost...

44:06.091 --> 44:08.303
Captain Jack Sparrow.

44:34.082 --> 44:37.168
Let's get away from this island
and head out to open sea.

44:37.252 --> 44:41.714
Yes to the first. Yes to the second, but
only insofar as we keep to the shallows.

44:41.840 --> 44:43.968
That seems a bit contradictory, Captain.

44:44.051 --> 44:47.221
I have faith in your reconciliatory
navigational skills.

44:47.304 --> 44:50.391
Now, where is that monkey?
I want to shoot something.

44:56.064 --> 44:58.442
Jack. Elizabeth is in danger.

44:58.525 --> 45:01.320
Have you considered
just locking her up somewhere?

45:01.404 --> 45:03.948
She is locked up,
bound to hang for helping you.

45:04.031 --> 45:08.996
There comes a time when one must
take responsibility for one's mistakes.

45:10.289 --> 45:12.666
I need that compass of yours, Jack.

45:12.791 --> 45:15.335
I must trade it for her freedom.

45:17.672 --> 45:20.341
-Mr. Gibbs.
-Captain.

45:20.425 --> 45:23.428
We have a need to travel upriver.

45:23.553 --> 45:27.057
By need, do you mean a trifling need?

45:27.141 --> 45:30.895
Fleeting?
As in, say, a passing fancy?

45:31.020 --> 45:34.774
No, a resolute and unyielding need.

45:34.899 --> 45:38.653
What we need to do
is make sail for Port Royal with all haste.

45:38.779 --> 45:40.655
William,

45:40.781 --> 45:42.824
I shall trade you the compass

45:42.908 --> 45:44.702
if you will help me

45:44.827 --> 45:46.954
to find this.

45:50.666 --> 45:53.128
-You want me to find this?
-No.

45:54.296 --> 45:56.757
You want you to find this,

45:56.840 --> 46:00.886
because the finding of this
finds you incapacitorially finding

46:01.011 --> 46:07.727
and/or locating in your discovering a way
to save your dolly belle, ol' what's-her-face.

46:07.811 --> 46:10.647
Savvy?

46:12.191 --> 46:14.735
This is going to save Elizabeth?

46:17.029 --> 46:20.117
How much do you know
about Davy Jones?

46:22.327 --> 46:23.912
Not much.

46:23.995 --> 46:26.998
Yeah, it's going to save Elizabeth.

46:53.319 --> 46:55.990
What's all this?

46:56.532 --> 47:01.579
If you both fancy the dress, you'll just have
to share and wear it one after the other.

47:01.662 --> 47:05.000
It's not like that, sir.
This ship is haunted.

47:05.542 --> 47:07.836
Is it, now? And you?

47:07.919 --> 47:12.048
There's a female presence
amongst us here, sir.

47:12.132 --> 47:14.594
All the men, they can feel it.

47:14.719 --> 47:18.473
It's the ghost of a lady widowed
before her marriage, I figure it,

47:18.556 --> 47:20.850
searching for her husband,
lost at sea.

47:20.933 --> 47:23.479
A virgin too, likely as not.

47:23.604 --> 47:25.814
And that bodes ill by all accounts.

47:25.939 --> 47:30.402
I say that we throw the dress overboard
and we hope the spirit follows it.

47:30.527 --> 47:33.364
No! That will just anger the spirit, sir.

47:33.448 --> 47:37.494
What we need to do is find out what
the spirit needs, and then get it back to her.

47:37.577 --> 47:39.789
Enough! Enough!

47:39.914 --> 47:44.210
You're a pair of superstitious goats
and it's got the best of you.

47:44.293 --> 47:47.463
Now, this appears to be no more
as we have a stowaway on board.

47:47.588 --> 47:49.716
A young woman, by the look of it.

47:49.841 --> 47:52.469
I want you to search the ship
and find her.

47:52.552 --> 47:55.305
Oh, and, er... she's probably naked.

48:25.214 --> 48:27.842
Why is Jack afraid
of the open ocean?

48:27.925 --> 48:30.302
Well, if you believe such things,

48:30.803 --> 48:33.557
there's a beast does the bidding
of Davy Jones -

48:33.682 --> 48:38.228
a fearsome creature with giant tentacles
that'll suction your face clean off

48:38.353 --> 48:41.941
and drag an entire ship
down to the crushing darkness.

48:43.609 --> 48:45.736
The kraken.

48:48.030 --> 48:51.952
They say the stench of its breath is like...

48:52.035 --> 48:55.539
Imagine, the last thing you know
on God's green earth

48:55.622 --> 49:01.546
is the roar of the kraken and the reeking
odor of a thousand rotting corpses.

49:03.465 --> 49:05.925
If you believe such things.

49:06.468 --> 49:08.846
And the key will spare him that?

49:08.971 --> 49:12.475
Well, that's the very question
Jack wants answered.

49:12.558 --> 49:15.019
Bad enough even to go visit...

49:15.978 --> 49:18.106
her.

49:18.231 --> 49:20.108
Her?

49:20.192 --> 49:22.152
Aye.

49:57.191 --> 50:00.861
No worries, mates.
Tia Dalma and I go way back.

50:00.986 --> 50:04.908
Thick as thieves.
Nigh inseparable, we are.

50:05.033 --> 50:07.327
Were. Have been.

50:08.537 --> 50:09.538
Before.

50:09.663 --> 50:12.583
-I'll watch your back.
-It's me front I'm worried about.

50:12.708 --> 50:15.169
-Mind the boat.
-Mind the boat.

50:16.045 --> 50:18.589
-Mind the boat.
-Mind the boat.

50:18.714 --> 50:20.759
-Mind the boat.

50:20.884 --> 50:23.011
Mind the boat.

50:34.816 --> 50:38.070
Jack Sparrow.

50:38.195 --> 50:40.281
Tia Dalma.

50:41.115 --> 50:45.662
I always knew the wind was going
to blow you back to me one day.

50:50.375 --> 50:52.335
You...

50:54.755 --> 50:57.341
You have a touch of...

50:57.466 --> 51:00.803
destiny about you,

51:00.928 --> 51:02.805
William Turner.

51:04.558 --> 51:06.685
You know me?

51:06.810 --> 51:09.396
You want to know me.

51:09.521 --> 51:14.152
There'll be no knowing here. We've come
for help and we're not leaving without it.

51:14.235 --> 51:17.864
-I thought I knew you.
-Not so well as I had hoped.

51:17.989 --> 51:20.116
-Come.
-Come.

51:23.871 --> 51:28.334
What service may I do you?

51:29.084 --> 51:33.006
-You know I demand payment.
-I brought payment.

51:36.635 --> 51:38.595
Look.

51:39.805 --> 51:42.183
An undead monkey.

51:42.308 --> 51:44.435
Top that.

51:48.398 --> 51:52.277
Don't! You've no idea
how long it took us to catch that.

51:52.778 --> 51:55.239
The payment is fair.

51:55.364 --> 51:57.325
We're looking for this.

51:59.911 --> 52:02.747
And what it goes to.

52:04.207 --> 52:08.838
The compass you bartered from me,
it cannot lead you to this?

52:08.963 --> 52:12.383
Maybe. Why?

52:12.466 --> 52:14.761
I hear you.

52:14.886 --> 52:19.349
Jack Sparrow does not know
what he wants.

52:19.975 --> 52:22.227
Or do you know,

52:22.352 --> 52:26.232
but are loath to claim it as your own?

52:27.984 --> 52:29.986
Your key go to a chest.

52:30.611 --> 52:35.159
And it is what lay inside the chest
you seek, don't it?

52:35.242 --> 52:38.162
-What is inside?
-Gold?

52:38.245 --> 52:42.292
Jewels? Unclaimed properties
of a valuable nature?

52:42.417 --> 52:45.587
Nothing bad, I hope?

52:46.337 --> 52:49.174
You know of Davy Jones,

52:49.299 --> 52:50.843
yes?

52:50.926 --> 52:53.679
A man of the sea.

52:53.804 --> 52:56.056
A great sailor,

52:56.182 --> 53:01.146
until he run afoul of that
which vex all men.

53:01.271 --> 53:04.274
What vexes all men?

53:05.817 --> 53:08.279
What indeed?

53:08.863 --> 53:10.823
-The sea.
-Sums.

53:10.948 --> 53:13.951
The dichotomy of good and evil.

53:14.577 --> 53:16.288
A woman.

53:16.580 --> 53:18.207
A woman.

53:18.290 --> 53:20.334
He fell in love.

53:20.459 --> 53:23.378
No, no, no, no.
I heard it was the sea he fell in love with.

53:23.504 --> 53:27.425
Same story, different versions,
and all are true.

53:27.550 --> 53:29.886
See, it was a woman

53:30.011 --> 53:32.764
as changing and harsh

53:32.847 --> 53:36.227
and untamable as the sea.

53:36.352 --> 53:38.729
Him never stopped loving her.

53:38.854 --> 53:43.652
But the pain it cause him
was too much to live with

53:43.735 --> 53:46.404
but not enough to cause him to die.

53:48.198 --> 53:52.662
What exactly did he put
into the chest?

53:52.745 --> 53:54.705
Him heart.

53:54.789 --> 53:56.833
Literally or figuratively?

53:56.958 --> 54:01.505
He couldn't literally
put his heart in a chest.

54:01.588 --> 54:03.549
Could he?

54:03.674 --> 54:09.764
It was not worth feeling
what small, fleeting joy life brings.

54:09.848 --> 54:11.474
And so...

54:11.599 --> 54:14.269
him carve out him heart,

54:14.894 --> 54:19.608
lock it away in a chest
and hide the chest from the world.

54:20.484 --> 54:22.528
The key

54:22.653 --> 54:27.200
he keep with him at all times.

54:27.826 --> 54:31.496
-You knew this.
-I did not. I didn't know where the key was.

54:31.621 --> 54:35.834
But now we do. All that's left is to climb
aboard the Flying Dutchman, grab the key,

54:35.917 --> 54:38.671
you go back to Port Royal
and save your bonnie lass, eh?

54:38.754 --> 54:41.591
Let me see your hand.

54:55.190 --> 54:57.650
The black spot!

54:58.735 --> 55:02.238
- The black spot!
- Black spot!

55:02.698 --> 55:05.784
My eyesight's as good as ever,
just so you know.

55:05.868 --> 55:09.288
I have just the thing.
Now, where did I put it?

55:12.792 --> 55:16.254
My little beauty, where are you?

55:16.379 --> 55:19.883
Such a long time in such a mess.

55:21.969 --> 55:24.805
Davy Jones cannot make port.

55:24.931 --> 55:28.267
Cannot step on land
but once every ten years.

55:28.809 --> 55:32.064
Land is where you are safe,
Jack Sparrow,

55:32.147 --> 55:34.650
and so you will carry land with you.

55:43.952 --> 55:45.912
Dirt.

55:47.081 --> 55:50.709
-This is a jar of dirt.
-Yes.

55:53.087 --> 55:55.924
Is the jar of dirt going to help?

55:56.049 --> 55:58.969
If you don't want it, give it back.

55:59.469 --> 56:02.639
-No.
-Then it helps.

56:04.851 --> 56:09.856
It seems we have a need to find
the Flying Dutchman.

56:13.025 --> 56:16.822
A touch of destiny.

56:32.339 --> 56:34.842
That's the Flying Dutchman?

56:36.802 --> 56:39.555
-She doesn't look like much.
-Neither do you.

56:39.680 --> 56:41.975
Do not underestimate her.

56:43.476 --> 56:47.856
-Must have run afoul of the reef.
-So, what's your plan, then?

56:47.981 --> 56:51.402
I row over, search the ship
until I find your bloody key.

56:51.527 --> 56:53.863
And if there are crewmen?

56:53.988 --> 56:56.199
I cut down anyone in my path.

56:57.074 --> 56:59.995
I like it. Simple, easy to remember.

57:00.078 --> 57:04.208
Your chariot awaits you, Sire.

57:07.587 --> 57:13.343
If you do happen to get captured, just say
Jack Sparrow sent you to settle his debt.

57:13.426 --> 57:17.306
-It might save your life.
- Bon voyage!

57:21.310 --> 57:23.854
Douse the lamps.

58:05.568 --> 58:06.610
Sailor.

58:06.735 --> 58:09.281
-Hoisting the jib, Captain's orders.
-Sailor!

58:09.406 --> 58:11.741
Hoisting the jib.
Bring up with a round turn.

58:11.867 --> 58:14.536
There's no use.
You've run aground.

58:14.661 --> 58:16.037
No.

58:16.121 --> 58:18.249
Beneath us.

58:19.125 --> 58:21.502
Foul breath.

58:34.099 --> 58:36.603
Hey! Hey!

59:14.102 --> 59:16.939
Down on your marrowbones and pray.

59:31.872 --> 59:35.793
Get back! Get back!

01:00:07.412 --> 01:00:11.040
Five men still alive.
The rest have moved on.

01:00:28.226 --> 01:00:31.397
Do you fear death?

01:00:32.815 --> 01:00:37.612
Do you fear that dark abyss?

01:00:39.531 --> 01:00:42.367
All your deeds laid bare.

01:00:43.243 --> 01:00:46.246
All your sins punished.

01:00:48.081 --> 01:00:50.543
I can offer you

01:00:50.668 --> 01:00:53.087
an escape.

01:00:53.213 --> 01:00:56.299
Don't listen to him!

01:01:04.934 --> 01:01:07.938
Do you not fear death?

01:01:10.398 --> 01:01:12.943
I'll take my chances, sir.

01:01:13.068 --> 01:01:15.446
To the depths.

01:01:20.952 --> 01:01:22.995
Cruel blackguard!

01:01:23.079 --> 01:01:25.207
Life is cruel.

01:01:26.166 --> 01:01:28.919
Why should the afterlife
be any different?

01:01:29.461 --> 01:01:32.632
I offer you a choice.

01:01:32.715 --> 01:01:35.385
Join my crew

01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:37.804
and postpone the judgment.

01:01:39.264 --> 01:01:42.768
One hundred years before the mast.

01:01:45.062 --> 01:01:47.022
Will ye serve?

01:01:48.816 --> 01:01:50.777
I-I will serve.

01:01:50.902 --> 01:01:53.280
There.

01:02:00.204 --> 01:02:03.708
You are neither dead nor dying.

01:02:03.791 --> 01:02:06.377
What is your purpose here?

01:02:09.214 --> 01:02:12.384
Jack Sparrow sent me
to settle his debt.

01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:16.763
What is your purpose here?

01:02:16.847 --> 01:02:20.018
Jack Sparrow
sent me to settle his debt.

01:02:23.021 --> 01:02:25.565
Did he, now?

01:02:25.690 --> 01:02:29.111
I'm sorely tempted to accept that offer.

01:02:46.047 --> 01:02:48.883
You have a debt to pay.

01:02:48.966 --> 01:02:52.345
You've been captain of the Black Pearl
for 13 years.

01:02:52.471 --> 01:02:54.514
That was our agreement.

01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:58.435
Technically I was only captain
for two years, then I was mutinied upon.

01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:02.315
Then you were a poor captain,
but a captain nonetheless.

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:05.693
Have you not introduced yourself
all these years

01:03:05.777 --> 01:03:08.321
as Captain Jack Sparrow?

01:03:11.325 --> 01:03:14.245
You have my payment.
One soul to serve on your ship.

01:03:14.370 --> 01:03:17.623
-One soul is not equal to another.

01:03:17.706 --> 01:03:24.214
We've established my proposal is sound
in principle. Now we're haggling over price.

01:03:24.339 --> 01:03:26.883
Price?

01:03:28.928 --> 01:03:32.390
Just how many souls
do you think my soul is worth?

01:03:36.185 --> 01:03:38.855
One hundred souls.

01:03:39.773 --> 01:03:41.567
Three days.

01:03:42.067 --> 01:03:45.905
You're a diamond, mate. Send me back
the boy. I'll get started right off.

01:03:46.030 --> 01:03:49.117
I keep the boy.
A good-faith payment.

01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:53.204
That leaves you only 99 more to go.

01:03:54.957 --> 01:03:56.917
Have you not met Will Turner?

01:03:57.042 --> 01:03:59.878
He's noble, heroic,
a terrific soprano.

01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:02.298
Worth at least four.

01:04:02.423 --> 01:04:04.634
Maybe three and a half.

01:04:05.468 --> 01:04:08.471
And did I happen to mention...

01:04:08.555 --> 01:04:10.974
he's in love?

01:04:11.850 --> 01:04:14.437
With a girl.

01:04:14.562 --> 01:04:16.939
Due to be married.

01:04:17.064 --> 01:04:19.025
Betrothed.

01:04:19.984 --> 01:04:24.698
Dividing him from her and her from him
would only be half as cruel

01:04:24.781 --> 01:04:28.744
as actually allowing them
to be joined in holy matrimony.

01:04:33.625 --> 01:04:38.463
I keep the boy. 99 souls.

01:04:38.588 --> 01:04:41.258
But I wonder, Sparrow,

01:04:41.342 --> 01:04:43.552
can you live with this?

01:04:44.303 --> 01:04:48.099
Can you condemn an innocent man,
a friend,

01:04:48.224 --> 01:04:53.146
to a lifetime of servitude in your name
while you roam free?

01:04:56.399 --> 01:04:58.402
Yep. I'm good with it.

01:04:58.527 --> 01:05:01.697
Shall we seal it in blood?
I mean... ink.

01:05:05.994 --> 01:05:08.747
Three days.

01:05:13.252 --> 01:05:15.380
-Three days.

01:05:23.012 --> 01:05:25.933
-Er, Mr. Gibbs.
-Aye.

01:05:26.016 --> 01:05:28.602
I-I feel sullied and unusual.

01:05:28.727 --> 01:05:34.484
And how do you intend to harvest
these 99 souls in three days?

01:05:34.609 --> 01:05:39.281
Fortunately, he was mum as to
the condition in which these souls need be.

01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:42.702
Tortuga.

01:05:43.786 --> 01:05:45.246
Tortuga.

01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:52.838
It's an outrage.
Port tariffs, berthing fees,

01:05:52.963 --> 01:05:56.216
wharf handling
and, heaven help us, pilotage.

01:05:56.300 --> 01:06:00.680
Are we all to work for
the East India Trading Company, then?

01:06:00.763 --> 01:06:05.226
I'm afraid, sir, Tortuga is
the only free port left in these waters.

01:06:05.310 --> 01:06:07.896
A pirate port is what you mean.
Well, I'm sorry.

01:06:08.022 --> 01:06:13.444
An honest sailor is what I am. I make
my living fair and I sleep well each night.

01:06:14.194 --> 01:06:16.071
S-sir!

01:06:39.389 --> 01:06:41.892
She wants you
to do something.

01:06:45.063 --> 01:06:47.732
She's trying to give a sign.

01:06:56.116 --> 01:06:58.577
Over there! Look for a sign!

01:07:03.375 --> 01:07:05.502
Look, there! There it is!

01:07:06.002 --> 01:07:08.546
-There's the sign!
-That's seaweed.

01:07:08.672 --> 01:07:11.759
-Seaweed can be a sign.
-Looks like entrails.

01:07:11.842 --> 01:07:16.889
-That would be a bad sign.
- What's that over there?

01:07:35.243 --> 01:07:38.414
And what makes you think
you're worthy to crew the Black Pearl?

01:07:38.539 --> 01:07:40.749
I've never sailed a day in me life.

01:07:40.874 --> 01:07:44.044
I figure I should get out,
see the world while I'm still young.

01:07:44.128 --> 01:07:47.465
You'll do. Make your mark.
Next!

01:07:47.591 --> 01:07:50.260
My wife ran off with my dog

01:07:50.719 --> 01:07:53.138
and I'm drunk for a month

01:07:53.263 --> 01:07:55.308
and I don't give an ass rat's

01:07:55.433 --> 01:07:57.393
if I live or die.

01:07:57.476 --> 01:08:00.479
-Perfect. Next!
-I know what I want. I know what I want...

01:08:00.605 --> 01:08:04.735
-Me have one arm and a bum leg.
-It's the crow's nest for you.

01:08:04.818 --> 01:08:06.945
-I know what I want.
- Next!

01:08:07.070 --> 01:08:12.660
Ever since I was a little lad, I've always
wanted to sail the seas... forever.

01:08:12.785 --> 01:08:15.455
Sooner than you think.
Sign the roster.

01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:17.832
Thanks very much.

01:08:17.957 --> 01:08:23.087
- How we going?
-Including those four, that gives us... four.

01:08:26.591 --> 01:08:28.719
And what's your story?

01:08:28.844 --> 01:08:31.305
My story.

01:08:31.430 --> 01:08:36.478
It's exactly the same as your story,
just one chapter behind.

01:08:36.603 --> 01:08:40.191
I chased a man
across the seven seas.

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:43.152
The pursuit cost me my crew,

01:08:43.234 --> 01:08:45.904
my commission,

01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:48.116
and my life.

01:08:53.205 --> 01:08:58.002
-Commodore?
-No, not any more. Weren't you listening?

01:09:01.046 --> 01:09:03.591
I nearly had you all off Tripoli.

01:09:04.384 --> 01:09:08.930
I would have,
if not for the hurricane.

01:09:09.014 --> 01:09:10.390
Lord.

01:09:10.474 --> 01:09:12.434
You didn't try to sail through it?

01:09:12.559 --> 01:09:15.063
So, do I make your crew

01:09:15.188 --> 01:09:17.148
or not?

01:09:18.024 --> 01:09:20.777
You haven't said where you're going.

01:09:20.859 --> 01:09:22.904
Somewhere nice?!

01:09:23.990 --> 01:09:26.367
So, am I worthy to serve

01:09:26.492 --> 01:09:29.245
under Captain Jack Sparrow?

01:09:31.747 --> 01:09:35.127
Or should I just kill you now?

01:09:41.301 --> 01:09:43.428
You're hired.

01:09:43.553 --> 01:09:47.515
Sorry. Old habits and all that.

01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:51.145
-Easy, sailor!
-That's our captain you're threatening.

01:10:04.367 --> 01:10:06.328
-Time to go.
-Aye!

01:10:51.003 --> 01:10:54.090
-Thanks, mate.

01:10:58.719 --> 01:11:00.597
Carry on.

01:11:07.938 --> 01:11:10.483
Come on, then! Who wants some?

01:11:10.608 --> 01:11:14.070
Form an orderly line
and I'll have you all, one by one.

01:11:14.195 --> 01:11:16.447
Come on, who's first?

01:11:19.118 --> 01:11:22.621
I just wanted the pleasure
of doing that myself.

01:11:49.318 --> 01:11:51.987
James Norrington.

01:11:52.904 --> 01:11:55.992
What has the world done to you?

01:12:24.148 --> 01:12:26.359
Heave!

01:12:26.651 --> 01:12:28.820
Heave!

01:12:29.529 --> 01:12:31.490
Heave!

01:12:31.782 --> 01:12:33.659
Heave!

01:12:34.743 --> 01:12:38.164
-Heave!
-Heave!

01:12:41.084 --> 01:12:45.046
Secure the mast tackle, Mr. Turner!

01:12:48.092 --> 01:12:50.219
Set to it!

01:12:55.558 --> 01:12:58.478
-Step aside.
-Hey! Mind yourself!

01:12:58.895 --> 01:13:01.272
Let go, boy!

01:13:03.942 --> 01:13:06.070
No.

01:13:14.079 --> 01:13:16.748
Haul that weevil to his feet.

01:13:22.297 --> 01:13:25.717
Five lashes will remind you
to stay on 'em!

01:13:25.842 --> 01:13:30.889
-No!
-Impeding me in my duties?

01:13:31.015 --> 01:13:34.810
-You'll share the punishment.
-I'll take it all.

01:13:34.935 --> 01:13:37.271
Will you, now?

01:13:37.396 --> 01:13:42.610
And what would prompt
such an act of charity?

01:13:46.364 --> 01:13:48.326
My son.

01:13:53.247 --> 01:13:55.541
He's my son.

01:14:06.804 --> 01:14:10.058
What fortuitous circumstance be this?

01:14:10.183 --> 01:14:14.020
Five lashes be owed, I believe it is.

01:14:18.984 --> 01:14:21.445
No. No, I won't!

01:14:21.570 --> 01:14:24.324
The cat's out of the bag, Mr. Turner.

01:14:24.783 --> 01:14:30.205
Your issue will feel its sting,
be it by the bosun's hand or your own.

01:14:34.085 --> 01:14:36.420
No.

01:14:36.545 --> 01:14:38.506
-Bosun!
-No!

01:15:22.763 --> 01:15:26.184
You had it easy, boy!

01:15:26.268 --> 01:15:29.187
-Will.
-I don't need your help.

01:15:30.981 --> 01:15:37.280
The bosun prides himself on cleaving flesh
from bone, with every swing.

01:15:37.405 --> 01:15:42.327
So I'm to understand
what you did was an act of compassion?

01:15:42.452 --> 01:15:44.538
Yes.

01:15:50.544 --> 01:15:56.384
100 years before the mast,
losing who you were, bit by bit,

01:15:56.509 --> 01:16:00.347
until you end up...
end up like poor Wyvern here.

01:16:02.183 --> 01:16:06.228
Once you've sworn an oath
to the Dutchman, there's no leaving it.

01:16:06.312 --> 01:16:09.398
Not until your debt is paid.

01:16:09.482 --> 01:16:11.902
I've sworn no oath.

01:16:13.654 --> 01:16:15.781
You must get away.

01:16:16.865 --> 01:16:18.993
Not until I find this.

01:16:20.662 --> 01:16:22.538
The key.

01:16:29.755 --> 01:16:32.132
The dead man's chest.

01:16:33.342 --> 01:16:35.427
What do you know of this?

01:16:35.552 --> 01:16:40.266
Open the chest with the key,
and stab the heart...

01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:43.436
No, don't stab the heart.

01:16:43.561 --> 01:16:48.567
The Dutchman needs a living heart
or there'll be no captain,

01:16:48.693 --> 01:16:52.989
and if there's no captain,
there's no one to have the key.

01:16:53.406 --> 01:16:55.951
So the captain has the key?

01:16:57.202 --> 01:16:59.955
-Where is the key?
-Hidden.

01:17:00.372 --> 01:17:03.125
-Where is the chest?
-Hidden.

01:17:06.337 --> 01:17:08.131
Captain Sparrow!

01:17:08.256 --> 01:17:10.675
Come to join me crew, lad?
Welcome aboard.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:13.470
I'm here to find the man I love.

01:17:14.471 --> 01:17:19.018
I'm deeply flattered, son,
but my first and only love is the sea.

01:17:20.144 --> 01:17:24.274
Meaning William Turner,
Captain Sparrow.

01:17:24.357 --> 01:17:25.734
Elizabeth.

01:17:25.817 --> 01:17:28.194
Hide the rum.

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:31.157
These clothes do not flatter you.
It should be a dress or nothing.

01:17:31.282 --> 01:17:34.368
-I happen to have no dress in my cabin.
-Jack.

01:17:36.579 --> 01:17:39.833
I know Will came to find you.
Where is he?

01:17:39.916 --> 01:17:43.420
Darling, I am truly unhappy
to have to tell you this, but...

01:17:43.545 --> 01:17:50.428
through unfortunate circumstances
that had nothing whatsoever to do with me,

01:17:50.553 --> 01:17:55.266
poor Will has been press-ganged
into Davy Jones's crew.

01:17:56.309 --> 01:17:58.187
Davy Jones?

01:17:59.688 --> 01:18:02.024
Oh, please.

01:18:03.150 --> 01:18:05.570
The captain of the Flying Dutchman?

01:18:05.695 --> 01:18:09.032
-You look awful. What are you doing here?
-You hired me.

01:18:09.157 --> 01:18:11.368
I can't help it if your standards are lax.

01:18:11.493 --> 01:18:14.330
-You smell funny.
-Jack!

01:18:14.789 --> 01:18:17.541
All I want is to find Will.

01:18:20.961 --> 01:18:25.425
Are you certain?
Is that what you really want most?

01:18:26.343 --> 01:18:28.679
Of course.

01:18:28.804 --> 01:18:33.017
Because I would think you'd want to find
a way to save Will most.

01:18:33.685 --> 01:18:37.522
-And you'd have a way of doing that?
-Well...

01:18:37.647 --> 01:18:40.901
-there is a chest.
-Oh, dear.

01:18:40.985 --> 01:18:43.278
A chest of unknown size and origin.

01:18:43.404 --> 01:18:48.283
What contains
the still-beating heart of Davy Jones.

01:18:49.744 --> 01:18:51.538
And whoever possesses that chest

01:18:51.663 --> 01:18:55.583
possesses the leverage to command Jones
to do whatever it is he or she wants,

01:18:55.709 --> 01:19:00.589
including saving brave William
from his grim fate.

01:19:00.715 --> 01:19:04.260
You don't actually believe him, do you?

01:19:09.057 --> 01:19:11.351
How would we find it?

01:19:13.562 --> 01:19:15.355
With this.

01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:18.401
My compass... is unique.

01:19:18.943 --> 01:19:22.113
"Unique" here
having the meaning of "broken".

01:19:23.156 --> 01:19:27.536
True enough,
this compass does not point north.

01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:32.583
Where does it point?

01:19:32.708 --> 01:19:37.464
It points to the thing
you want most in this world.

01:19:40.175 --> 01:19:42.135
Oh, Jack.

01:19:44.180 --> 01:19:47.892
-Are you telling the truth?
-Every word, love.

01:19:48.017 --> 01:19:50.436
And what you want most in this world

01:19:51.354 --> 01:19:56.234
is to find the chest of Davy Jones,
is it not?

01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:01.282
-To save Will.
-By finding the chest of Davy Jones.

01:20:16.382 --> 01:20:18.718
-Mr. Gibbs!
-Cap'n.

01:20:18.802 --> 01:20:21.054
-We have our heading.
-Finally!

01:20:21.137 --> 01:20:25.725
Cast off those lines.
Weigh anchor and crowd that canvas!

01:20:25.809 --> 01:20:29.105
-Miss Swann.

01:20:30.064 --> 01:20:33.484
Welcome to the crew,
former commodore.

01:20:40.117 --> 01:20:44.998
There's something to knowing the exact
shape of the world and one's place in it.

01:20:45.081 --> 01:20:47.792
I assure you, these are not necessary.

01:20:47.875 --> 01:20:52.338
I thought you'd be interested
in the whereabouts of your daughter.

01:20:52.422 --> 01:20:55.926
-You have news of her?
-Most recently seen on Tortuga,

01:20:56.010 --> 01:20:59.972
and then left in the company
of a known pirate, Jack Sparrow,

01:21:00.055 --> 01:21:02.976
and other fugitives from justice.

01:21:03.059 --> 01:21:04.894
"Justice"? Hardly.

01:21:04.978 --> 01:21:10.775
Including the previous owner of this sword,
I believe.

01:21:11.276 --> 01:21:16.032
Our ships are in pursuit. Justice will
be dispensed by cannonade and cutlass,

01:21:16.115 --> 01:21:20.077
and all manner
of remorseless pieces of metal.

01:21:20.161 --> 01:21:26.168
I find it distasteful to even contemplate
the horror facing all those on board.

01:21:29.464 --> 01:21:31.299
What do you want from me?

01:21:31.382 --> 01:21:34.552
Your authority as governor,
your influence in London,

01:21:34.635 --> 01:21:38.223
and your loyalty
to the East India Trading Company.

01:21:39.266 --> 01:21:41.810
To you, you mean.

01:21:45.439 --> 01:21:48.193
Shall I remove these shackles?

01:21:51.404 --> 01:21:54.824
Do what you can for my daughter.

01:22:01.082 --> 01:22:06.046
So you see, Mercer, every man
has a price he will willingly accept.

01:22:06.129 --> 01:22:10.008
Even for what he hoped never to sell.

01:22:15.682 --> 01:22:18.810
I wager... ten years.

01:22:19.686 --> 01:22:22.021
I'll match ten years.

01:22:23.023 --> 01:22:24.733
Agreed.

01:22:27.736 --> 01:22:30.489
Wondering how it's played?

01:22:30.572 --> 01:22:32.450
-I understand.
-Liar!

01:22:32.534 --> 01:22:38.123
It's a game of deception. But your bet
includes all the dice, not just your own.

01:22:38.498 --> 01:22:41.544
-What are they wagering?
-Oh, the only thing we have.

01:22:41.627 --> 01:22:44.004
Years of service.

01:22:46.132 --> 01:22:50.345
-So any crew member can be challenged?
-Aye. Anyone.

01:22:53.223 --> 01:22:55.976
I challenge Davy Jones.

01:23:15.623 --> 01:23:18.585
I accept, mate.

01:23:30.139 --> 01:23:35.687
-The stakes?
-My soul. An eternity of servitude.

01:23:35.771 --> 01:23:37.981
No!

01:23:40.150 --> 01:23:41.693
Against?

01:23:43.154 --> 01:23:45.156
I want this.

01:23:57.294 --> 01:24:02.217
-How do you know of the key?
-That's not part of the game, is it?

01:24:05.387 --> 01:24:08.014
You can still walk away.

01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:35.796
-What's this?
-I'm in. Matching his wager.

01:24:35.879 --> 01:24:38.799
No! Don't do this.

01:24:40.718 --> 01:24:43.512
The die is cast.

01:24:43.595 --> 01:24:46.683
I bid three twos.

01:24:46.766 --> 01:24:48.935
It's your bid, Captain.

01:24:55.234 --> 01:24:58.237
Four fours.

01:25:07.330 --> 01:25:10.459
Four fives.

01:25:10.542 --> 01:25:12.253
Six threes.

01:25:21.930 --> 01:25:25.100
Seven fives.

01:25:49.002 --> 01:25:51.296
Eight fives.

01:25:56.010 --> 01:25:59.514
Welcome to the crew, lad.

01:26:01.682 --> 01:26:04.686
Twelve fives.

01:26:04.937 --> 01:26:06.605
Twelve fives.

01:26:06.688 --> 01:26:09.525
Call me a liar, or up the bid.

01:26:10.859 --> 01:26:14.447
And be called a liar myself
for my trouble?

01:26:17.909 --> 01:26:22.790
Bootstrap Bill, you're a liar
and you will spend an eternity on this ship.

01:26:24.709 --> 01:26:28.921
Master Turner,
feel free to go ashore...

01:26:30.214 --> 01:26:33.343
the very next time we make port!

01:26:40.935 --> 01:26:44.480
Fool. Why did you do that?

01:26:46.023 --> 01:26:48.234
I couldn't let you lose.

01:26:48.318 --> 01:26:51.071
It was never about winning or losing.

01:26:53.449 --> 01:26:54.908
The key.

01:26:56.577 --> 01:26:59.456
You just wanted to know where it was.

01:27:19.061 --> 01:27:21.688
Captain says I'm to relieve you.

01:27:25.693 --> 01:27:27.779
Captain's orders.

01:29:17.609 --> 01:29:20.196
Here. Take this, too.

01:29:21.155 --> 01:29:24.533
Now, get yourself to land, and stay there.

01:29:24.992 --> 01:29:28.246
It was always in my blood to die at sea.

01:29:28.330 --> 01:29:31.374
It was not a fate I ever wanted for you.

01:29:36.129 --> 01:29:39.842
It's not a fate you had to choose
for yourself, either.

01:29:39.926 --> 01:29:46.141
Aye. I could say I did what I had to,
when I left you to go pirating.

01:29:47.059 --> 01:29:51.397
But it would taste a lie
to say it wasn't what I wanted.

01:29:53.107 --> 01:29:55.777
You owe me nothing, Will.

01:29:55.860 --> 01:29:58.071
Now go.

01:29:59.197 --> 01:30:01.866
-They'll know you helped me.

01:30:03.244 --> 01:30:05.246
What more can they do to me?

01:30:11.085 --> 01:30:13.338
I take this with a promise.

01:30:13.422 --> 01:30:15.841
I'll find a way to sever
Jones's hold on you,

01:30:15.924 --> 01:30:19.803
and not rest until this blade
pierces his heart.

01:30:21.305 --> 01:30:23.641
I will not abandon you.

01:30:26.269 --> 01:30:28.855
I promise.

01:30:42.996 --> 01:30:45.123
- Beckett?
- Yes, they're signed.

01:30:45.206 --> 01:30:47.752
Lord Cutler Beckett
of the East India Trading Company.

01:30:49.336 --> 01:30:53.090
Will was working for Beckett
and never said a word.

01:30:53.466 --> 01:30:57.262
Beckett wants the compass.
Only one reason for that.

01:30:57.345 --> 01:30:59.890
Of course.

01:30:59.973 --> 01:31:03.727
-He wants the chest.
-Yes, he did say something about a chest.

01:31:03.810 --> 01:31:07.440
If the company controls the chest,
they controls the sea.

01:31:07.523 --> 01:31:11.277
-A truly discomfiting notion, love.
-And bad.

01:31:11.360 --> 01:31:15.032
Bad for every mother's son
what calls himself a pirate.

01:31:15.115 --> 01:31:18.368
I think there's a bit more speed
to be coaxed from these sails.

01:31:18.452 --> 01:31:20.579
Brace the foreyard!

01:31:20.662 --> 01:31:23.875
Might I enquire
as to how you came by these?

01:31:23.958 --> 01:31:25.877
-Persuasion.
-Friendly?

01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:27.587
Decidedly not.

01:31:27.670 --> 01:31:33.260
Will strikes a deal, yet you were the one
with the prize -full pardon.

01:31:33.344 --> 01:31:35.679
"Commission as a privateer
on behalf of England

01:31:35.763 --> 01:31:38.474
and the East India Trading Company."

01:31:38.557 --> 01:31:40.852
As if I could be bought
for such a low price.

01:31:40.936 --> 01:31:43.438
-Jack, the letters, give them back.
-No.

01:31:43.522 --> 01:31:45.857
Persuade me.

01:31:45.941 --> 01:31:49.737
You do know Will taught me
how to handle a sword?

01:31:52.115 --> 01:31:55.827
As I said, persuade me.

01:32:10.093 --> 01:32:12.554
It's a curious thing.

01:32:13.638 --> 01:32:19.311
There was a time I would have wanted you
to look like that while thinking about me.

01:32:19.395 --> 01:32:21.564
-I don't know what you mean.
-I think you do.

01:32:21.647 --> 01:32:24.692
Oh, don't be absurd.
I trust him, that's all.

01:32:29.364 --> 01:32:31.658
So you never wondered
how your latest fiancÃ©

01:32:31.742 --> 01:32:35.788
ended up on the Flying Dutchman
in the first place?

01:33:00.273 --> 01:33:03.569
Strange to come upon
a longboat so far out in open water.

01:33:03.652 --> 01:33:07.072
Just put as many leagues behind us
as you can. As fast as you can.

01:33:07.156 --> 01:33:10.285
And what are we running from?

01:33:15.082 --> 01:33:17.876
That dress. Where did you get it?

01:33:17.959 --> 01:33:19.670
It was found aboard the ship.

01:33:19.754 --> 01:33:24.258
The crew thought it was a spirit
bringing some omen of ill-fate.

01:33:24.342 --> 01:33:27.763
-That's foolish.
-Oh, yes. Exceedingly foolish.

01:33:27.846 --> 01:33:33.852
It brought good fortune.
The spirit told us, "Pull in at Tortuga",

01:33:33.936 --> 01:33:35.938
and we made a nice bit of profit there.

01:33:36.022 --> 01:33:39.150
Off the books, of course.

01:33:39.234 --> 01:33:43.029
I imagine some of your crew
may have jumped ship there.

01:33:43.113 --> 01:33:45.991
-Why do you ask?
-Captain! A ship's been spotted.

01:33:46.075 --> 01:33:48.911
-Colors?
-She isn't flying any.

01:33:48.994 --> 01:33:50.996
-Pirates.
-Or worse.

01:34:02.467 --> 01:34:06.055
You will watch this.

01:34:13.188 --> 01:34:16.191
Let no joyful voice be heard!

01:34:18.318 --> 01:34:21.489
Let no man look up at the sky with hope.

01:34:23.783 --> 01:34:29.540
And let this day be cursed
by we who ready to wake...

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.169
the kraken.

01:34:33.586 --> 01:34:35.254
No!

01:34:52.148 --> 01:34:54.692
I've doomed us all.

01:34:55.151 --> 01:34:57.988
It's the Flying Dutchman!

01:35:02.910 --> 01:35:05.330
Oh, Mother Carey's chickens!
What happened?

01:35:05.413 --> 01:35:07.957
Must have hit a reef.

01:35:15.591 --> 01:35:18.636
Free the rudder!
Hard to port then hard to starboard.

01:35:18.719 --> 01:35:22.223
-Free the rudder!
-Hard to port!

01:35:29.481 --> 01:35:32.985
-Kraken!
-Kraken!

01:35:46.458 --> 01:35:49.420
Here it is! Take it!

01:35:49.504 --> 01:35:51.506
Take it!

01:38:03.445 --> 01:38:07.991
The boy's not here.
He must have been claimed by the sea.

01:38:08.074 --> 01:38:10.577
I am the sea.

01:38:14.248 --> 01:38:17.501
You need time alone with your thoughts.

01:38:17.585 --> 01:38:20.130
-Brig!
-What of the survivors?

01:38:25.635 --> 01:38:29.015
There are no survivors.

01:38:49.204 --> 01:38:53.082
The chest is no longer safe.
Chart a course to Isla Cruces.

01:38:53.166 --> 01:38:55.878
Get me there first,
or there'll be the devil to pay.

01:38:55.961 --> 01:38:57.797
"First"?

01:38:57.880 --> 01:39:01.091
Who sent that thieving charlatan
onto my ship?

01:39:01.175 --> 01:39:03.135
Who told him of the key?

01:39:06.264 --> 01:39:08.433
Jack Sparrow.

01:39:26.787 --> 01:39:33.586
My intuitive sense of the female creature
informs me that you are troubled.

01:39:33.670 --> 01:39:37.090
I just thought I'd be married by now.

01:39:37.173 --> 01:39:39.510
I'm so ready to be married.

01:39:47.059 --> 01:39:49.104
You know...

01:39:50.730 --> 01:39:56.153
Lizzie, I am captain of a ship,

01:39:56.236 --> 01:40:04.745
and being captain of a ship, I could in fact
perform a "marr-i-age" right here.

01:40:04.829 --> 01:40:07.207
Right on this deck.

01:40:07.291 --> 01:40:09.251
Right... now.

01:40:12.880 --> 01:40:15.175
No, thank you.

01:40:15.258 --> 01:40:16.801
Why not?

01:40:16.885 --> 01:40:19.929
We are very much alike, you and I.
I and you. Us.

01:40:20.013 --> 01:40:25.102
Oh. Except for a sense of honor
and decency and a moral center.

01:40:25.561 --> 01:40:27.980
And personal hygiene.

01:40:29.440 --> 01:40:31.734
Trifles.

01:40:31.817 --> 01:40:34.362
You will come over to my side. I know it.

01:40:34.446 --> 01:40:39.743
-You seem very certain.
-One word, love. Curiosity.

01:40:39.826 --> 01:40:41.454
You long for freedom.

01:40:41.537 --> 01:40:44.624
You long to do what you want to do
because you want it.

01:40:44.707 --> 01:40:47.794
To act on selfish impulse.

01:40:47.877 --> 01:40:50.631
You want to see what it's like.

01:40:50.714 --> 01:40:55.177
One day, you won't be able to resist.

01:40:55.719 --> 01:40:58.305
Why doesn't your compass work?

01:40:59.933 --> 01:41:03.019
My compass works fine.

01:41:03.436 --> 01:41:05.230
Because you and I are alike,

01:41:05.313 --> 01:41:08.567
and there will come a moment
when you have a chance to show it.

01:41:08.651 --> 01:41:11.946
-To do the right thing.
-I love those moments.

01:41:12.446 --> 01:41:14.740
I like to wave at them as they pass by.

01:41:14.824 --> 01:41:20.413
You'll have the chance to do something...
something courageous.

01:41:20.497 --> 01:41:23.667
And when you do,
you'll discover something.

01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:26.337
That you're a good man.

01:41:26.420 --> 01:41:28.923
All evidence to the contrary.

01:41:29.006 --> 01:41:32.051
Oh, I have faith in you.

01:41:32.135 --> 01:41:35.055
-Want to know why?
-Do tell, dearie.

01:41:36.849 --> 01:41:39.852
Curiosity.

01:41:39.935 --> 01:41:42.896
You're going to want it.

01:41:42.980 --> 01:41:46.860
A chance to be admired
and gain the rewards that follow.

01:41:48.194 --> 01:41:50.363
You won't be able to resist.

01:41:51.739 --> 01:41:56.954
You're going to want to know
what it tastes like.

01:41:59.498 --> 01:42:02.502
I do want to know what it tastes like.

01:42:02.586 --> 01:42:04.379
But... seeing as you're a good man,

01:42:04.462 --> 01:42:08.884
I know that you'd never put me in a position
that would compromise my honor.

01:42:17.185 --> 01:42:19.313
I'm proud of you, Jack.

01:42:19.396 --> 01:42:22.232
Land, ho!

01:42:27.404 --> 01:42:29.240
I want my jar of dirt.

01:42:30.700 --> 01:42:33.620
-You're pulling too fast.
-You're pulling too slow.

01:42:33.703 --> 01:42:38.834
-We don't want the kraken to catch us.
-I'm saving me strength for when it comes.

01:42:38.918 --> 01:42:43.339
And I don't think it's "kracken" anyways.
I always heard it said "krayken".

01:42:43.422 --> 01:42:45.049
-With a long a?

01:42:45.132 --> 01:42:49.012
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. "Krocken"
is how it's pronounced in Scandinavian,

01:42:49.095 --> 01:42:50.847
and "kracken" is closer to that.

01:42:50.931 --> 01:42:54.393
We ain't Scandinavians, are we?
"Krayken."

01:42:54.477 --> 01:42:57.188
It's a mythological creature.
I can calls it what I wants.

01:43:01.067 --> 01:43:03.320
Guard the boat. Mind the tide.

01:43:03.403 --> 01:43:05.739
Don't touch my dirt.

01:43:41.612 --> 01:43:46.826
This doesn't work. And it certainly
doesn't show you what you want most.

01:43:50.998 --> 01:43:54.334
Yes, it does.
You're sitting on it.

01:43:55.210 --> 01:43:56.921
-Beg pardon?
-Move.

01:44:04.637 --> 01:44:07.433
-"Guard the boat!" "Mind the tide!"
-I could join the circus.

01:44:07.516 --> 01:44:09.143
Mind if I shine your shoes, sir?

01:44:13.564 --> 01:44:18.278
They're here. And I cannot step foot
on land again for near of a decade.

01:44:18.361 --> 01:44:20.363
You'll trust us to act in your stead?

01:44:20.447 --> 01:44:23.826
I'll trust you to know
what awaits you should you fail!

01:44:25.411 --> 01:44:28.414
-Down, then!
-Down!

01:45:38.117 --> 01:45:40.202
It's real.

01:45:41.162 --> 01:45:43.248
You actually were telling the truth.

01:45:43.331 --> 01:45:46.877
I do that quite a lot,
yet people are always surprised.

01:45:46.960 --> 01:45:49.838
With good reason!

01:45:49.921 --> 01:45:52.383
Will!

01:45:52.466 --> 01:45:56.262
You're all right! Thank God!
I came to find you!

01:46:02.311 --> 01:46:04.438
How did you get here?

01:46:04.521 --> 01:46:08.483
Sea turtles, mate.
A pair of them, strapped to my feet.

01:46:08.567 --> 01:46:10.445
Not so easy, is it?

01:46:10.528 --> 01:46:13.156
-But I do owe you thanks, Jack.
-You do?

01:46:13.239 --> 01:46:17.410
After you tricked me onto that ship
to square your debt with Jones...

01:46:17.494 --> 01:46:19.538
-What?
- What?

01:46:20.122 --> 01:46:22.791
...I was reunited with my father.

01:46:22.875 --> 01:46:25.586
Oh, well... you're welcome, then.

01:46:26.086 --> 01:46:29.925
Everything you said to me,
every word was a lie!

01:46:30.008 --> 01:46:31.510
Pretty much.

01:46:31.593 --> 01:46:33.970
Time and tide, love.

01:46:34.054 --> 01:46:36.307
Oi! What are you doing?

01:46:37.391 --> 01:46:39.769
I'm going to kill Jones.

01:46:40.770 --> 01:46:43.064
Can't let you do that, William.

01:46:43.147 --> 01:46:49.196
Cos if Jones is dead, who's to call
his terrible beastie off the hunt, eh?

01:46:55.245 --> 01:46:58.581
Now, if you please.

01:46:59.249 --> 01:47:01.793
The key.

01:47:03.963 --> 01:47:06.674
I keep the promises I make, Jack.

01:47:06.757 --> 01:47:10.094
I intend to free my father.
I hope you're here to see it.

01:47:10.177 --> 01:47:13.807
I can't let you do that either.
So sorry.

01:47:13.890 --> 01:47:17.519
I knew you'd warm up to me eventually.

01:47:18.353 --> 01:47:22.316
Lord Beckett desires
the content of that chest.

01:47:22.400 --> 01:47:25.528
I deliver it, I get my life back.

01:47:25.945 --> 01:47:28.656
Ah. The dark side of ambition.

01:47:29.073 --> 01:47:32.494
Oh, I prefer to see it
as the promise of redemption.

01:47:36.790 --> 01:47:38.334
Stop it!

01:47:45.049 --> 01:47:46.551
Will!

01:47:47.553 --> 01:47:50.681
-Guard the chest!
-No!

01:47:50.764 --> 01:47:55.644
This is barbaric!
This is no way for grown men to...

01:47:55.729 --> 01:48:01.276
Oh, fine! Let's just haul out our swords
and start banging away at each other.

01:48:01.359 --> 01:48:03.987
That will solve everything! I've had it!

01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:09.035
I've had it with wobbly-legged,
rum-soaked pirates!

01:48:11.662 --> 01:48:16.835
-How'd this go all screwy?
-Well, each wants the chest for hisself.

01:48:16.919 --> 01:48:20.088
Mr. Norrington, I think,
is trying to regain a bit of honor,

01:48:20.172 --> 01:48:22.675
old Jack's looking to trade it,
save his own skin,

01:48:22.759 --> 01:48:26.930
then Turner, there, I think he's trying
to settle some unresolved business

01:48:27.013 --> 01:48:30.642
'twixt him and his
twice-cursed pirate father.

01:48:30.725 --> 01:48:32.686
-Sad.
- This is madness!

01:48:32.770 --> 01:48:36.565
That chest must be worth
more than a shiny penny.

01:48:36.649 --> 01:48:38.567
Terrible temptation.

01:48:38.651 --> 01:48:44.658
If we was any kind of decent,
we'd remove temptation from their path.

01:48:50.331 --> 01:48:52.166
Enough!

01:48:58.507 --> 01:49:01.093
The heat!

01:49:20.155 --> 01:49:22.241
Bugger!

01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:36.883
By your leave, Mr. Turner.

01:50:23.809 --> 01:50:26.897
By your leave, Mr. Norrington.

01:51:18.996 --> 01:51:22.000
Do excuse me
while I kill the man who ruined my life.

01:51:22.083 --> 01:51:26.129
-Be my guest.
-Let us examine that claim for a moment.

01:51:26.546 --> 01:51:32.011
Who was it, that at the very moment you
had a notorious pirate safely behind bars,

01:51:32.094 --> 01:51:38.393
saw fit to free said pirate and
take your dearly beloved all to hisself?

01:51:40.020 --> 01:51:42.606
So whose fault is it, really,

01:51:42.689 --> 01:51:47.069
that you've ended up a rum-pot deckhand
what takes orders from pirates?

01:51:47.153 --> 01:51:49.155
Enough!

01:51:51.407 --> 01:51:55.204
Unfortunately, Mr. Turner, he's right!

01:51:57.164 --> 01:51:59.082
Still rooting for you, mate.

01:52:57.231 --> 01:53:00.067
We got it! We got it! We got it!

01:53:14.416 --> 01:53:17.503
Hello, poppet.

01:53:44.325 --> 01:53:46.243
Come on, run!

01:54:29.083 --> 01:54:31.043
- Sword!
-Sword! Sword!

01:54:34.004 --> 01:54:36.550
Sword!

01:55:17.261 --> 01:55:19.890
Follow my voice.
Follow my voice.

01:55:19.973 --> 01:55:22.225
To the left... no, turn around.

01:55:22.309 --> 01:55:24.394
Go to the right.

01:55:24.477 --> 01:55:27.105
No, that's a tree.

01:55:27.188 --> 01:55:29.609
Oh, shut it.

01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:20.498
Jar of dirt!

01:57:20.607 --> 01:57:22.609
Right.

01:57:55.771 --> 01:57:58.065
We've got it!

01:58:07.743 --> 01:58:10.788
Come on, Turner!

01:58:26.931 --> 01:58:31.477
Leave him lie! Unless you plan
on using him to hit something with.

01:58:31.894 --> 01:58:34.564
-We're not getting out of this.
-Not with the chest.

01:58:34.648 --> 01:58:36.608
Into the boat.

01:58:36.692 --> 01:58:39.653
-You're mad!
-Don't wait for me.

01:58:45.827 --> 01:58:49.581
-I say we respect his final wish.
-Aye!

01:58:58.966 --> 01:59:01.469
Your bravery is wasted.

01:59:02.846 --> 01:59:09.185
I shall pry the chest away
from your cold, dead hands.

01:59:11.063 --> 01:59:12.857
-Here you go!

01:59:24.620 --> 01:59:26.455
Pirates!

01:59:34.422 --> 01:59:36.008
Hey!

01:59:44.516 --> 01:59:48.021
-What happened to the chest?
-Norrington took it to draw them off.

01:59:48.438 --> 01:59:51.691
-You're pulling too hard!
-You ain't pulling hard enough!

01:59:52.108 --> 01:59:55.154
-Where's the commodore?
-Fell behind.

01:59:55.237 --> 01:59:57.406
My prayers be with him.

01:59:57.490 --> 01:59:59.492
Best not wallow in our grief.

01:59:59.575 --> 02:00:04.456
The bright side is you're back,
and made it off free and clear.

02:00:19.806 --> 02:00:22.142
Lord on high, deliver us.

02:00:25.396 --> 02:00:27.231
I'll handle this, mate.

02:00:29.484 --> 02:00:31.152
Oi, fishface!

02:00:32.612 --> 02:00:35.198
Lose something? Eh? Scungilli!

02:00:40.454 --> 02:00:42.456
Got it!

02:00:43.666 --> 02:00:46.711
Come to negotiate, eh,
have you, you slimy git?

02:00:46.794 --> 02:00:48.255
Look what I got.

02:00:48.338 --> 02:00:51.425
I got a jar of dirt,
I got a jar of dirt

02:00:51.508 --> 02:00:53.427
And guess what's inside it?

02:00:54.344 --> 02:00:55.847
Enough!

02:01:03.938 --> 02:01:06.692
-Hard to starboard.
-Hard to starboard!

02:01:06.775 --> 02:01:09.945
Brace up the foreyard!

02:01:13.073 --> 02:01:15.118
Hard to starboard!

02:01:15.201 --> 02:01:20.123
Send his beloved Pearl
back to the depths.

02:01:32.179 --> 02:01:36.058
She's on us! She's on us!

02:01:37.643 --> 02:01:41.731
-Let them taste the triple guns.
-Aye, Captain.

02:02:07.593 --> 02:02:09.136
Make fast!

02:02:10.388 --> 02:02:12.932
Go on, me darling!
Show us what you've got!

02:02:13.015 --> 02:02:15.769
Come on, girl!

02:02:21.817 --> 02:02:24.236
-She's falling behind!
-Aye. We've got her!

02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:28.032
-We're the faster?
-Against the wind, the Dutchman beats us.

02:02:28.116 --> 02:02:30.576
-But with the wind...
-We rob her advantage.

02:02:30.660 --> 02:02:32.495
Aye.

02:02:34.540 --> 02:02:36.083
We're out of range!

02:02:36.166 --> 02:02:40.796
Break off pursuit,
run her light and douse canvas!

02:02:40.879 --> 02:02:43.258
We're giving up, sir?

02:02:53.352 --> 02:02:55.646
They're giving up!

02:03:01.737 --> 02:03:03.864
My father is on that ship.

02:03:03.947 --> 02:03:06.450
We can take her.
We should turn and fight.

02:03:06.533 --> 02:03:13.499
Why fight when you can negotiate?
All one needs is the proper leverage.

02:03:23.594 --> 02:03:26.389
Where is it?
Where is the thump-thump?

02:03:27.766 --> 02:03:30.727
We must have hit a reef!

02:03:32.812 --> 02:03:36.859
No. It's not a reef!
Get away from the rail!

02:03:36.943 --> 02:03:39.987
-What is it?
-The kraken.

02:03:40.363 --> 02:03:42.615
-To arms!
-Load guns! Defend the mast!

02:03:42.698 --> 02:03:47.162
It'll attack the starboard. Run out
the cannons and hold for my signal!

02:04:20.741 --> 02:04:23.202
Easy, boys!

02:04:26.580 --> 02:04:27.623
Will?

02:04:28.124 --> 02:04:30.335
Steady! Steady.

02:04:32.296 --> 02:04:35.757
-Will!
-Hold. Hold.

02:04:35.841 --> 02:04:38.845
I think we've held fire long enough.

02:04:40.054 --> 02:04:42.432
-Will!
-Fire!

02:05:02.537 --> 02:05:06.083
-It'll be back. We have to get off the ship.
-There's no boats.

02:05:14.301 --> 02:05:18.889
Pull the grates. Get all the gunpowder
onto the net in the cargo hold!

02:05:21.224 --> 02:05:25.688
-Whatever you do, don't miss.
-As soon as you're clear.

02:05:39.871 --> 02:05:44.000
We are short-stocked on gunpowder!
Six barrels!

02:05:45.001 --> 02:05:47.128
Hurry up!

02:05:47.212 --> 02:05:50.800
-There's only six kegs of powder!
-Then load the rum.

02:05:59.685 --> 02:06:02.521
Aye, the rum too!

02:06:30.719 --> 02:06:32.722
Step to!

02:06:36.392 --> 02:06:38.978
Oh, you coward.

02:06:43.817 --> 02:06:45.861
Not good.

02:06:53.745 --> 02:06:56.456
-Haul away!
-Heave!

02:06:56.539 --> 02:07:00.878
-Heave like you're being paid for it!
-Put your backs into it!

02:07:43.968 --> 02:07:47.221
-I got you! I got you!
-Don't let me go!

02:07:47.304 --> 02:07:49.974
-I won't let you go!
-Shoot me!

02:07:55.271 --> 02:07:58.316
-Clear?
-Higher! Higher!

02:08:15.168 --> 02:08:17.295
Here! Come on!

02:08:17.963 --> 02:08:20.591
Come and get me. I'm over here!

02:08:20.675 --> 02:08:22.760
Come on!

02:08:47.705 --> 02:08:50.958
Shoot! Elizabeth, shoot!

02:10:18.264 --> 02:10:20.182
Did we kill it?

02:10:20.266 --> 02:10:23.895
No. We just made it angry.

02:10:24.271 --> 02:10:27.232
We're not out of this yet.
Captain, orders!

02:10:29.151 --> 02:10:31.863
Abandon ship. Into the longboat.

02:10:34.115 --> 02:10:36.993
Jack. The Pearl.

02:10:38.244 --> 02:10:40.621
She's only a ship, mate.

02:10:40.706 --> 02:10:43.250
He's right.
We have to head for land.

02:10:43.334 --> 02:10:46.420
-It's a lot of open water.
-It's a lot of water.

02:10:46.503 --> 02:10:51.134
We have to try. We can get away
as it takes down the Pearl.

02:10:53.053 --> 02:10:54.888
Abandon ship.

02:10:54.971 --> 02:10:57.390
Abandon ship or abandon hope.

02:11:14.117 --> 02:11:16.287
Thank you, Jack.

02:11:18.373 --> 02:11:21.125
We're not free yet, love.

02:11:21.209 --> 02:11:23.378
You came back.

02:11:25.923 --> 02:11:28.634
I always knew you were a good man.

02:11:41.606 --> 02:11:44.402
Prepare to cast off.
There's no time to lose.

02:11:44.485 --> 02:11:46.946
Come on, Will. Step to!

02:12:06.050 --> 02:12:08.511
It's after you, not the ship.

02:12:08.594 --> 02:12:11.515
It's not us.

02:12:11.598 --> 02:12:14.393
This is the only way, don't you see?

02:12:17.688 --> 02:12:19.858
I'm not sorry.

02:12:25.405 --> 02:12:27.408
Pirate.

02:12:46.804 --> 02:12:49.015
Where's Jack?

02:12:52.602 --> 02:12:56.565
He elected to stay behind
to give us a chance.

02:13:05.241 --> 02:13:07.077
Go!

02:13:19.840 --> 02:13:23.261
Bugger. Bugger, bugger,
bugger, bugger, bugger!

02:13:51.543 --> 02:13:53.670
Come on!

02:13:57.925 --> 02:14:00.678
Just got it. Come on.

02:14:29.752 --> 02:14:32.213
Not so bad.

02:14:33.590 --> 02:14:34.674
Oh.

02:14:43.517 --> 02:14:45.353
Hello, beastie.

02:15:34.199 --> 02:15:38.412
Jack Sparrow, our debt is settled.

02:15:39.746 --> 02:15:41.999
The captain goes down with his ship.

02:15:42.083 --> 02:15:46.087
Turns out not even Jack Sparrow
can best the devil.

02:15:51.385 --> 02:15:53.971
Open the chest.

02:15:55.097 --> 02:15:57.641
Open the chest. I need to see it!

02:16:13.242 --> 02:16:19.249
Damn you, Jack Sparrow!

02:16:25.047 --> 02:16:27.800
The last of our ships is returned.

02:16:27.884 --> 02:16:30.303
Is there any news on the chest?

02:16:30.386 --> 02:16:36.018
None. But one of the ships
did pick up a man adrift at sea.

02:16:36.101 --> 02:16:38.270
He had these.

02:16:45.236 --> 02:16:48.406
I took the liberty of filling in my name.

02:16:55.956 --> 02:17:00.044
If you intend to claim these,
then you must have something to trade.

02:17:00.127 --> 02:17:02.755
Do you have the compass?

02:17:02.839 --> 02:17:04.674
Better.

02:17:11.849 --> 02:17:14.394
The heart of Davy Jones.

02:18:09.830 --> 02:18:12.290
Against the cold...

02:18:12.374 --> 02:18:14.710
and the sorrow.

02:18:24.972 --> 02:18:27.558
It's a shame.

02:18:27.641 --> 02:18:30.102
I know you're thinking that with the Pearl

02:18:30.186 --> 02:18:35.566
you could have captured the devil
and set free your father's soul.

02:18:35.650 --> 02:18:38.403
Doesn't matter now.

02:18:38.486 --> 02:18:41.074
The Pearl is gone,

02:18:41.156 --> 02:18:43.117
along with its captain.

02:18:43.200 --> 02:18:45.411
Aye.

02:18:45.495 --> 02:18:49.415
And already the world
seems a bit less bright.

02:18:49.500 --> 02:18:52.628
He fooled us all right till the end,

02:18:52.710 --> 02:18:56.465
but I guess that honest streak
finally won out.

02:18:59.343 --> 02:19:01.096
To Jack Sparrow.

02:19:01.179 --> 02:19:06.184
-Never another like Captain Jack.
-He was a gentleman of fortune, he was.

02:19:06.769 --> 02:19:08.853
He was a good man.

02:19:29.544 --> 02:19:33.632
If there was anything could be done
to bring him back...

02:19:35.008 --> 02:19:37.343
-Elizabeth.
-Would you do it?

02:19:39.972 --> 02:19:42.267
What would you...

02:19:45.770 --> 02:19:49.691
What would any of you
be willing to do, hm?

02:19:50.860 --> 02:19:54.780
Would you sail to the ends of the Earth
and beyond

02:19:54.864 --> 02:19:59.953
to fetch back witty Jack
and him precious Pearl?

02:20:06.084 --> 02:20:07.335
Aye.

02:20:08.421 --> 02:20:09.756
Aye.

02:20:10.381 --> 02:20:11.591
Aye.

02:20:12.258 --> 02:20:13.968
Aye.

02:20:16.972 --> 02:20:19.058
Yes.

02:20:21.310 --> 02:20:22.561
Aye.

02:20:22.644 --> 02:20:24.646
All right.

02:20:25.690 --> 02:20:32.739
But if you go and brave the weird
and haunted shores at world's end...

02:20:33.823 --> 02:20:40.122
then you will need a captain
who knows those waters.

02:20:55.014 --> 02:20:59.185
So tell me,
what's become of my ship?
