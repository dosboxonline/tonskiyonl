WEBVTT

00:37.463 --> 00:39.171
It was midnight when I drove home.

00:40.130 --> 00:43.005
As I approached the bungalow,
I switched off the headlamps

00:43.088 --> 00:46.130
so the beam wouldn't swing
through the window and wake Harry Pope.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.588
I needn't have bothered.
His light was still on.

00:48.671 --> 00:50.421
I parked, went up to the porch,

00:50.505 --> 00:53.088
counting each step
so I wouldn't take an extra step,

00:53.171 --> 00:55.921
which wasn't there, at the top.
One, two, three, four.

01:00.838 --> 01:03.713
I went to Harry's room,
opened it quietly, and looked in.

01:03.796 --> 01:07.005
He was lying in bed awake.
He didn't move or even turn his head.

01:07.088 --> 01:09.296
But I heard him whispering,
almost inaudible…

01:09.380 --> 01:10.296
[whispering] Help.

01:10.380 --> 01:11.213
"Help"?

01:11.296 --> 01:12.296
[clock ticking]

01:14.130 --> 01:16.380
I pushed the door
and started across the room.

01:16.463 --> 01:17.296
Stop.

01:17.380 --> 01:19.171
"Stop"? I could hardly hear a word.

01:19.255 --> 01:22.130
He seemed to be straining enormously
to produce sound.

01:22.213 --> 01:23.963
- Help.
- "Help"?

01:24.046 --> 01:25.463
What's the matter, Harry?

01:25.546 --> 01:27.755
Take off shoes.

01:28.421 --> 01:30.005
"Take off shoes"?

01:30.088 --> 01:33.338
He reminded me of George Barling
after he got shot in the stomach

01:33.421 --> 01:35.088
when he leaned against a crate,

01:35.171 --> 01:37.880
gripping himself
and muttering about the Japanese pilot

01:37.963 --> 01:40.963
in just the same straining
half-whisper Harry was using now.

01:41.046 --> 01:43.296
Then George Barling bent over, of course…

01:43.380 --> 01:44.213
and died.

01:45.005 --> 01:46.005
Take off shoes.

01:46.713 --> 01:47.796
"Take off shoes."

01:49.880 --> 01:52.463
I couldn't understand,
but I wasn't going to object.

01:59.380 --> 02:01.005
- What is it, Harry?
- Don't touch.

02:03.421 --> 02:06.796
He was on his back with a sheet
covering three-quarters of his body,

02:06.880 --> 02:09.171
wearing striped pajamas
and sweating terribly.

02:09.255 --> 02:11.588
It was hot.
I was sweating, but not like Harry.

02:11.671 --> 02:13.796
His face was wet
and the pillow was soaked.

02:13.880 --> 02:15.338
It looked like malaria to me.

02:15.421 --> 02:16.755
- What is it, Harry?
- Krait.

02:16.838 --> 02:17.713
- What?
- Krait.

02:17.796 --> 02:19.130
- "Krait"?
- Snake.

02:20.338 --> 02:22.088
You've been bitten. How long ago?

02:22.171 --> 02:23.005
No.

02:23.088 --> 02:23.921
What?

02:27.546 --> 02:28.755
Didn't bite yet.

02:30.796 --> 02:33.046
That confused me.
I gave Harry a funny look.

02:34.921 --> 02:37.755
Krait on stomach. Asleep.

02:40.338 --> 02:42.338
I jumped backwards. I couldn't help it.

02:42.421 --> 02:45.088
I stared at his stomach,
at the sheet that covered it.

02:45.171 --> 02:48.130
It was impossible to tell
if there was something underneath.

02:48.213 --> 02:51.338
You don't mean there's a krait
on your stomach now? Asleep?

02:51.421 --> 02:52.255
Yes.

02:59.796 --> 03:01.338
How'd it get there?

03:01.421 --> 03:05.130
I shouldn't have asked a question.
I should've just told him to keep quiet.

03:06.130 --> 03:12.463
Lying on back. Reading.
Felt something on chest, behind book.

03:12.546 --> 03:13.463
Tickling.

03:15.796 --> 03:21.255
From corner of eye,
saw little krait sliding over pajamas.

03:22.088 --> 03:24.463
Small. Maybe ten inches.

03:25.755 --> 03:30.046
Knew mustn't move.
Lay frozen, watching it.

03:30.130 --> 03:33.546
Thought it would go over top of sheet.

03:33.630 --> 03:35.255
[Woods] Harry was silent for a moment.

03:35.338 --> 03:39.046
He was making sure his whispering
wasn't disturbing the thing laying there.

03:40.463 --> 03:41.963
It went under.

03:43.463 --> 03:47.505
Felt it through pajamas.
Moving on stomach.

03:48.630 --> 03:52.838
Then it stopped. Now lying there asleep.

03:56.713 --> 03:57.880
I've been waiting.

03:58.796 --> 04:00.421
- [Woods] How long?
- For hours.

04:01.255 --> 04:04.088
Hours and hours
and bloody hours and hours.

04:04.171 --> 04:06.963
Can't keep still much longer.
Need to cough.

04:10.255 --> 04:11.380
[Roald] <i>In fact,</i>

04:11.463 --> 04:13.880
<i>it wasn't a surprising thing</i>
<i>for a krait to do.</i>

04:13.963 --> 04:17.546
They linger around people's houses
and go for the warm places.

04:17.630 --> 04:20.713
The surprising thing was
that Harry hadn't been bitten so far.

04:20.796 --> 04:23.755
The bite is ferociously deadly,
unless you catch it at once,

04:23.838 --> 04:26.130
with a dose of antivenom
immediately at hand.

04:26.963 --> 04:29.046
Slim, little things. They look like this.

04:31.338 --> 04:33.005
One might slip, discreetly,

04:33.088 --> 04:37.088
through the just-cracked open door
of a small child's bedroom, for instance.

04:38.671 --> 04:42.880
The manager of a tea estate once told me
about a sheep bitten on the hind leg.

04:42.963 --> 04:47.255
When he cut open the carcass,
its blood ran pitch, black as tar.

04:51.421 --> 04:54.713
[whispering] "All right, Harry," I said.
Now I was whispering too.

04:54.796 --> 04:57.130
Don't move
and don't talk unless you have to.

04:57.213 --> 04:59.755
It won't bite unless it's frightened.
We'll fix it.

05:01.296 --> 05:02.380
[door opens]

05:02.463 --> 05:04.213
[in normal voice] I went out softly

05:04.296 --> 05:06.713
and fetched a small sharp knife
from the kitchen.

05:06.796 --> 05:11.005
I put it in my pocket ready to use in case
Harry frightened the krait and got bitten.

05:11.088 --> 05:13.463
I was ready to cut Harry
and suck out the venom.

05:14.463 --> 05:17.088
[whispering] "Harry,
I think the best thing to do

05:17.171 --> 05:20.255
is for me to draw back the sheet
very gently and have a look."

05:20.880 --> 05:22.880
You idiot.

05:24.338 --> 05:28.213
There was no expression in his voice.
He spoke too slowly and softly for that.

05:28.296 --> 05:31.630
The expression was in the eyes
and corners of the mouth.

05:32.255 --> 05:36.338
Light will startle. Snake will kill me.

05:38.088 --> 05:39.130
Good point.

05:39.713 --> 05:42.921
How about I whip back the sheet
and brush it off the instant--

05:43.005 --> 05:44.255
Get doctor.

05:45.880 --> 05:48.838
He looked at me as if
I should have thought of that myself.

05:48.921 --> 05:51.630
A doctor. Of course.
That's it. I'll get Dr. Ganderbai.

05:51.713 --> 05:54.171
I tiptoed out,
looked up Dr. Ganderbai's number,

05:54.255 --> 05:56.630
lifted the phone
and told the operator to hurry.

05:56.713 --> 05:57.963
[phone ringing]

05:58.046 --> 05:59.046
[clock ticking]

06:01.588 --> 06:04.963
- This is Supervisor Woods.
- Hello, Mr. Woods. You're not in bed yet?

06:05.046 --> 06:07.171
Come at once and bring serum. For a krait.

06:07.255 --> 06:08.880
Serum? Who's been bitten?

06:08.963 --> 06:11.505
The question came
like a small explosion in my ear.

06:11.588 --> 06:12.713
No one. No one, yet.

06:12.796 --> 06:15.671
Harry's got one
sleeping on his stomach under the sheet.

06:15.755 --> 06:18.421
For about three seconds
there was silence on the line.

06:19.796 --> 06:23.505
Speaking slowly, not like an explosion,
precisely, Dr. Ganderbai said…

06:23.588 --> 06:26.463
He's not to move or talk.
Do you understand?

06:26.546 --> 06:28.463
- Of course, Doctor.
- I'm coming now.

06:28.546 --> 06:30.713
He rang off,
and I went back to the bedroom.

06:33.005 --> 06:34.713
Harry's eyes walked me to his bed.

06:34.796 --> 06:37.255
[whispering] Dr. Ganderbai's coming.
He said to lie still.

06:37.338 --> 06:40.630
- What does he think I've been doing?
- No talking. Either of us.

06:40.713 --> 06:41.838
Shut up, then.

06:42.838 --> 06:46.088
The muscles on one side of his mouth,
the muscles used for smiling

06:46.171 --> 06:48.005
started twitching, little movements

06:48.088 --> 06:50.755
that continued for a while
after he finished speaking.

06:50.838 --> 06:53.671
I didn't like that,
or the way he talked, either.

06:53.755 --> 06:56.796
- [car approaching]
- Dr. Ganderbai's car sped up to the front.

06:58.671 --> 06:59.838
I went out to meet him.

07:03.088 --> 07:05.880
- Where is he?
- Dr. Ganderbai didn't stop for my answer.

07:05.963 --> 07:09.296
He walked on past me into the hall.
He put his bag down on a chair.

07:09.380 --> 07:11.296
He was wearing
soft-soled bedroom slippers.

07:11.380 --> 07:14.296
He walked across the floor noiselessly,
like a careful cat.

07:14.380 --> 07:16.380
Harry watched out the sides of his eyes.

07:16.463 --> 07:19.130
Upon reaching the bed,
he looked at Harry and smiled,

07:19.213 --> 07:21.338
reassuring, nodding his head as if to say…

07:21.421 --> 07:24.588
Don't worry. This is a simple matter.
Leave it to Dr. Ganderbai.

07:24.671 --> 07:26.880
He went into the kitchen,
and I followed him.

07:28.421 --> 07:29.630
He opened his bag.

07:29.713 --> 07:33.671
First is to try to get serum into him,
but I must do it neatly. He can't flinch.

07:33.755 --> 07:36.005
He held a hypodermic and a small bottle.

07:36.088 --> 07:38.838
He stuck in the needle
and drew up a pale yellow liquid.

07:38.921 --> 07:41.380
- He handed it to me.
- Hold that till I ask for it.

07:41.463 --> 07:42.671
We returned to the room.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.421
[clock ticking]

07:47.588 --> 07:49.921
[whispering] Harry's eyes
were bright and open.

07:50.005 --> 07:52.421
Dr. Ganderbai
cautiously rolled up Harry's sleeve

07:52.505 --> 07:54.338
to the elbow without moving the arm.

07:54.421 --> 07:56.713
He stood well away from the bed.
He whispered…

07:56.796 --> 07:59.921
I'm going to give you an injection.
Just a prick. Don't move.

08:00.005 --> 08:02.671
Don't tighten your stomach muscles.
Let them go limp.

08:02.755 --> 08:06.213
Harry looked at the syringe.
His smiling muscle began to twitch again.

08:07.213 --> 08:10.796
Dr. Ganderbai took rubber tubing
and tied it tight around Harry's bicep.

08:10.880 --> 08:13.463
He sponged a small area
of the forearm with alcohol.

08:13.546 --> 08:16.338
He held up the syringe,
squinting at the calibrations,

08:16.421 --> 08:17.796
squirting out some fluid.

08:17.880 --> 08:19.713
Harry was sweating all over his face

08:19.796 --> 08:22.213
so it shone like face cream
melting on his skin,

08:22.296 --> 08:23.338
running down the pillow.

08:23.421 --> 08:26.963
I could see the blue vein on his forearm,
swollen under the tourniquet.

08:27.046 --> 08:30.338
Needle above the vein,
Ganderbai holding it flat against the arm,

08:30.421 --> 08:32.755
sliding the needle sideways into the vein,

08:32.838 --> 08:35.671
slowly and firmly
so it went in smooth as into cheese.

08:35.755 --> 08:38.713
Harry closed his eyes
and opened them again but didn't move.

08:38.796 --> 08:41.088
Ganderbai leaned forward,
mouth close to Harry's ear.

08:41.171 --> 08:45.296
Now you'll be all right even if it bites,
but don't move. I'll be back in a moment.

08:46.005 --> 08:49.046
- "Is he safe now?" I asked.
- It might or might not save him.

08:49.130 --> 08:51.921
Ganderbai wiped his forehead
and stood nibbling his lip.

08:52.005 --> 08:54.963
There is a way to do this.
There is a way to do this.

08:55.046 --> 08:57.963
He was speaking slowly
and trying to think while he talked.

08:59.713 --> 09:03.796
We're going to administer an anesthetic

09:03.880 --> 09:06.755
to the creature where it lies.

09:08.380 --> 09:09.838
It was a splendid suggestion.

09:09.921 --> 09:11.838
It's not safe.
A snake is cold-blooded.

09:11.921 --> 09:14.630
Anesthetic doesn't work well
with cold-blooded animals.

09:14.713 --> 09:17.505
But I don't have any other ideas.
Ether or chloroform?

09:17.588 --> 09:18.630
I nodded.

09:18.713 --> 09:21.088
- Which one?
- Was he asking me? I don't know.

09:21.171 --> 09:22.005
[loudly] Chloroform!

09:22.588 --> 09:25.380
[in normal voice]
He pulled me to the hall.

09:25.463 --> 09:27.088
- [door opens]
- Drive to my house.

09:27.171 --> 09:28.796
The boy will be waiting for you.

09:28.880 --> 09:30.796
Here's the key to my poisons cupboard.

09:30.880 --> 09:32.880
Take chloroform. It has an orange label.

09:32.963 --> 09:36.046
The name is printed on it.
I'll stay in case anything happens.

09:36.130 --> 09:37.338
Be quick!

09:37.421 --> 09:39.046
- My shoes…
- You don't need shoes.

09:39.130 --> 09:40.171
[engine starts]

09:41.755 --> 09:45.088
[Woods] I drove fast, and in 15 minutes
I was back with the bottle.

09:47.755 --> 09:51.421
He knows what we're going to do,
but he's understandably losing his nerve.

09:51.505 --> 09:53.588
I'm not sure how much longer he can last.

09:57.255 --> 10:00.213
[whispering] Harry was lying
in the same position as before.

10:00.296 --> 10:03.755
His face was white and wet.
He turned his eyes towards me.

10:03.838 --> 10:05.338
I smiled at him and nodded.

10:05.421 --> 10:08.171
The doctor picked up the tube
he'd used as a tourniquet,

10:08.255 --> 10:10.463
now with a paper funnel
fitted into one end.

10:10.546 --> 10:13.255
He untucked a section of sheet
from under the mattress,

10:13.338 --> 10:15.046
took the rubber tube, inserted it,

10:15.130 --> 10:17.546
and slid it under the sheet
towards Harry's body.

10:17.630 --> 10:20.046
Not sure how long it took
to slide that tube in.

10:20.130 --> 10:23.213
It may have been 20 minutes, or 40.
I never saw the tube move,

10:23.296 --> 10:25.796
but the visible part of it
grew gradually shorter.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.838
Dr. Ganderbai himself was sweating now,

10:27.921 --> 10:30.380
large pearls on his forehead
and upper lip,

10:30.463 --> 10:31.796
but his hands were steady,

10:31.880 --> 10:34.796
and his eyes were glued to the sheet
above Harry's stomach.

10:34.880 --> 10:36.880
He held out his hand for the chloroform.

10:36.963 --> 10:39.880
I twisted out the stopper
and put the bottle into his hand,

10:39.963 --> 10:42.505
not letting go
until I was sure he had a good hold.

10:43.171 --> 10:47.463
Mr. Pope, I'm going to soak the mattress.
It's going to be cold under your body.

10:47.546 --> 10:50.130
- Be ready for it and don't move.
- Get on with it!

10:50.213 --> 10:52.671
[whispering] For the first time,
Harry raised his voice.

10:52.755 --> 10:55.713
Dr. Ganderbai looked up,
watched him and went back to business.

10:55.796 --> 10:59.046
He poured into the funnel
and waited while it ran down the tube.

10:59.130 --> 11:01.005
He poured some more and waited again.

11:09.046 --> 11:12.171
The heavy, sickening smell of chloroform
spread over the room

11:12.255 --> 11:14.005
bringing faint, unpleasant memories

11:14.088 --> 11:17.213
of nurses and surgeons
in a white room with a long white table.

11:17.296 --> 11:18.880
Ganderbai was pouring steadily,

11:18.963 --> 11:23.005
and I could see the heavy vapor swirling
like smoke above the paper funnel.

11:23.588 --> 11:26.588
He paused, poured one more
and handed the bottle back to me.

11:26.671 --> 11:29.130
Slowly he drew out the rubber tube,
then stood up.

11:29.213 --> 11:32.005
The strain of this procedure
must have been enormous

11:32.088 --> 11:34.130
because he sounded like this…

11:34.213 --> 11:37.796
- [shakily] Give it 15 minutes to be safe.
- [whispering] I leaned over to tell Harry.

11:37.880 --> 11:39.796
- We'll give it--
- [loudly] I heard him!

11:39.880 --> 11:43.088
This time Dr. Ganderbai sprang 'round,
his face suddenly angry.

11:43.171 --> 11:46.630
Stared at Harry, a cold stone.
Harry's smiling muscle began to twitch.

11:46.713 --> 11:48.338
We waited 15 minutes by the bed.

11:48.421 --> 11:50.463
Dr. Ganderbai watched Harry's face

11:50.546 --> 11:53.046
in the most curious,
profoundly intense, arresting gaze,

11:53.130 --> 11:54.755
concentrating all his will power

11:54.838 --> 11:57.380
on keeping Harry
absolutely still and quiet.

11:57.463 --> 12:00.088
He never took his eye away,
and although he made no sound,

12:00.171 --> 12:02.046
he seemed to be shouting at him.

12:02.130 --> 12:04.505
- Something like…
- [loudly] Don't move or speak!

12:04.588 --> 12:06.880
You're not spoiling this now! You hear me?

12:07.505 --> 12:10.088
[Woods] In this silence,
Harry lay there twitching his mouth,

12:10.171 --> 12:12.255
sweating, closing his eyes, opening them,

12:12.338 --> 12:14.380
looking at me, the sheet, the ceiling,

12:14.463 --> 12:16.046
never looking at Dr. Ganderbai.

12:16.130 --> 12:18.255
Yet somehow,
Dr. Ganderbai was holding him.

12:19.880 --> 12:21.921
It was like someone
was blowing up a huge balloon,

12:22.005 --> 12:24.630
that it was going to burst,
but I couldn't turn away.

12:24.713 --> 12:28.255
Finally Dr. Ganderbai nodded,
and I knew he was ready to proceed.

12:28.338 --> 12:29.671
Go to the other side.

12:29.755 --> 12:32.296
We'll each take a side of the sheet
and draw it back together.

12:32.380 --> 12:34.505
Very slowly, please. Keep still, Mr. Pope.

12:45.505 --> 12:48.046
[Woods] The whole of Harry's chest
was visible now.

12:48.130 --> 12:50.296
I saw the white cord
of his pajama trousers

12:50.380 --> 12:51.588
neatly tied in a bow.

12:51.671 --> 12:54.380
A little farther below,
I saw a mother-of-pearl button,

12:54.463 --> 12:56.296
something I never had on my pajamas,

12:56.380 --> 12:58.505
a fly-button,
let alone a mother-of-pearl one.

12:58.588 --> 12:59.796
Odd how one sometimes

12:59.880 --> 13:02.005
has frivolous thoughts
at exciting moments.

13:02.088 --> 13:03.880
Nothing else was on his stomach.

13:06.505 --> 13:07.588
Don't move, Mr. Pope.

13:07.671 --> 13:10.755
Ganderbai peered around
along Harry's body and under his legs.

13:10.838 --> 13:13.630
Be careful. It could be anywhere,
up the pajama leg.

13:13.713 --> 13:14.546
Harry sat up.

13:14.630 --> 13:16.380
[breathing heavily]

13:16.463 --> 13:18.130
It was the first time he'd moved.

13:18.213 --> 13:19.505
[exclaiming]

13:19.588 --> 13:22.421
Harry jumped up, stood on his bed,
shook his legs violently.

13:22.505 --> 13:23.963
We thought he'd been bitten.

13:24.046 --> 13:25.796
Ganderbai was scrambling for a scalpel,

13:25.880 --> 13:27.713
but then Harry ceased leaping,
stood still,

13:27.796 --> 13:29.505
looked down at the mattress and shouted…

13:29.588 --> 13:30.421
It's not there!

13:30.505 --> 13:33.088
Dr. Ganderbai straightened up.
He looked at Harry.

13:33.171 --> 13:35.296
Harry was all right.
He hadn't been bitten.

13:35.380 --> 13:37.421
He wasn't going to get bitten or killed.

13:37.505 --> 13:39.130
And everything was fine.

13:39.213 --> 13:40.088
Sort of.

13:41.130 --> 13:43.380
[chuckling] Maybe you were dreaming,
Mr. Pope.

13:45.963 --> 13:47.546
[heart beating]

13:51.630 --> 13:53.005
[Woods] The way he said it,

13:53.088 --> 13:55.630
I knew his teasing
was not seriously intended.

13:55.713 --> 13:57.796
He was easing up
after the extreme strain.

13:57.880 --> 14:00.505
Harry didn't take it that way.
He stood in his pajamas,

14:00.588 --> 14:03.463
glaring at Ganderbai. The color
began to spread over his cheeks.

14:03.546 --> 14:05.796
Are you suggesting I'm a liar?

14:08.588 --> 14:11.005
Dr. Ganderbai remained still,
watching Harry.

14:11.088 --> 14:14.296
Harry took a pace forward on the bed.
A shining look in his eyes.

14:15.463 --> 14:18.963
- You dirty, little, Bengali, sewer rat.
- "Shut up, Harry," I said.

14:19.046 --> 14:21.296
- You dirty, brown, filthy, little…
- Shut up!

14:21.380 --> 14:22.838
- Backwards-caste…
- Shut your mouth!

14:22.921 --> 14:23.796
Stop!

14:23.880 --> 14:25.713
[breathing heavily]

14:27.213 --> 14:29.963
Ganderbai left the room.
I followed him onto the screened porch.

14:30.046 --> 14:32.171
He's out of his mind,
doesn't know what he's saying.

14:32.255 --> 14:36.130
We went across the drive in the darkness
to the doctor's old Morris Motor car.

14:36.213 --> 14:39.130
He got inside.
"You did a miraculous thing," I said.

14:39.213 --> 14:41.421
- "You saved his life."
- No, I don't think so.

14:41.505 --> 14:44.255
I mean, you might've…
He owes you his life.

14:44.338 --> 14:47.130
- I mean, he owes you his life, Doctor.
- No, he doesn't.

14:49.713 --> 14:50.630
I'm sorry.

14:52.088 --> 14:53.088
You can't be.

14:56.630 --> 14:57.880
[engine starts]

15:00.380 --> 15:02.921
Dr. Ganderbai started the engine
and drove off.

15:03.796 --> 15:05.421
[engine revving]
