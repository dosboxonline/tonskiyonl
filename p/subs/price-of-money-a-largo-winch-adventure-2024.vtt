00:36.920 --> 00:40.199
When I was little,
my favourite thing was performing.

00:42.679 --> 00:44.480
I thought I was Michael Jackson.

00:47.280 --> 00:49.320
But I lost that as I got older.

00:51.960 --> 00:55.119
I had lost a huge part of that little boy.

01:43.160 --> 01:47.760
At the Grammis yesterday, Benjamin
Ingrosso was named Artist of the Year.

01:47.840 --> 01:49.640
The winner of Song of the Year...

01:49.720 --> 01:51.280
Benjamin Ingrosso!

01:51.360 --> 01:52.840
Benjamin Ingrosso!

01:54.000 --> 01:55.920
Thank you, Sweden!

02:25.560 --> 02:30.040
WHILE TOURING ACROSS SWEDEN,
BENJAMIN INGROSSO IS SIMULTANEOUSLY

02:30.120 --> 02:34.160
RECORDING SONGS
FOR HIS FIRST INTERNATIONAL ALBUM.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.320
- Hi.
- Hey, good morning.

02:47.400 --> 02:51.960
- Good morning, I'm Victoria.
- Benjamin, nice to meet you, welcome.

02:52.040 --> 02:55.400
- You've done so much as an artist.
- Yeah.

02:55.480 --> 02:59.680
- It's hard to keep track of the awards.
- That's very kind of you to say.

02:59.760 --> 03:02.440
Do you ever feel like,
"I can't top this."?

03:02.520 --> 03:04.280
Um... no.

03:04.360 --> 03:09.560
No, but these last few years I've
really had to pinch myself many times.

03:09.640 --> 03:13.840
At the same time...
I think to a lot of people,

03:13.920 --> 03:16.120
I haven't been an artist for very long.

03:16.200 --> 03:19.440
But I've been doing this
since I was eight or nine years old.

03:19.520 --> 03:22.360
I have so much left to do.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.680
And I still have dreams.

03:32.400 --> 03:35.760
We've finished phase one and after that...

03:35.840 --> 03:37.160
Yeah.

03:37.240 --> 03:41.640
<i>...we'll start chasing the dream you've</i>
<i>had since you were five years old.</i>

03:43.640 --> 03:44.960
Yes.

03:45.040 --> 03:46.360
It'll start for real.

03:46.440 --> 03:50.280
We'll go to L.A. to start working on
the end of the album,

03:50.360 --> 03:52.240
which will start phase two.

04:00.760 --> 04:05.200
My biggest dream
is to take my artistry abroad.

04:07.320 --> 04:10.440
I have a goal,
a sold out Madison Square Garden.

04:16.120 --> 04:18.760
I'm worried Sweden will think it's hubris.

04:18.840 --> 04:22.520
Especially when you say out loud
that you want something.

04:25.000 --> 04:29.400
I will put all my energy, time and power
into making this dream come true.

04:30.520 --> 04:33.240
LOS ANGELES

04:37.080 --> 04:40.440
I can dive but the thing is,
I have to cover my ears.

04:54.480 --> 04:57.920
We are now in L.A.

04:58.000 --> 05:03.600
because Benjamin has a week of sessions

05:03.680 --> 05:07.040
to finish a bunch of songs
for the next album.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.960
He's working with David Stewart
and Jessica Agombar.

05:10.040 --> 05:13.520
They're two songwriters
who have been in Billboard.

05:13.600 --> 05:18.240
They're still kind of up-and-comers
but with a pretty good track record.

05:20.280 --> 05:23.040
I've known Benjamin
since I was eight, he was six.

05:23.120 --> 05:27.240
We used to hang out at his place,
he pretended to be Vanheden.

05:27.320 --> 05:31.320
Then we'd go to my place, my mum cooked
a carbonara he didn't like at all.

05:31.400 --> 05:35.360
And he'd often dance
in front of the mirror in our hallway.

05:37.240 --> 05:41.600
I think the world needs
a real performer on a global level,

05:41.680 --> 05:45.200
which I don't feel
really exists like it used to.

05:45.280 --> 05:48.960
My goal is for Benjamin to become
one of the world's biggest artists.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.600
Anything less would be failure.

05:51.680 --> 05:55.600
It is so hot, hot, hot.

05:57.320 --> 05:58.760
- I'm good. You?
- Jetlagged?

05:58.840 --> 06:00.880
No, not at all. I slept for ten hours.

06:05.240 --> 06:09.800
Benjamin! Benjamin! Benjamin!

06:09.880 --> 06:11.200
What are they saying?

06:11.280 --> 06:15.760
Benjamin, but in Swedish.
Yeah! Crazy, right?

06:15.840 --> 06:19.920
- Benjamin!
- It's like a different accent. Benjamin.

06:20.480 --> 06:24.840
And I kind of know more right now
where I want to go with my sound,

06:24.920 --> 06:27.160
cause when we had our session,

06:27.240 --> 06:30.200
that was my first session
for the entire new chapter

06:30.280 --> 06:33.600
so I kind of didn't know
where I wanted to go.

06:49.080 --> 06:50.800
This is the world we're in.

06:51.360 --> 06:54.640
It has ABBA-ish and Queen vibes.

06:54.720 --> 06:59.960
So if I come home with our song,

07:00.040 --> 07:05.800
that could be more of a good song
to show the producers in Stockholm,

07:05.880 --> 07:07.960
like this is where we wanna go.

07:08.040 --> 07:09.360
I kinda want, like...

07:12.080 --> 07:14.600
What would a crowd sing like...

07:17.240 --> 07:19.720
- You know, that kind of, like...
- Yeah.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.680
How did it go today?

07:45.760 --> 07:48.080
- Shit.
- What, in what way?

07:48.160 --> 07:49.560
We didn't make a song.

07:49.640 --> 07:53.800
I'm spraying ideas, but he always
wants to change it into something else

07:53.880 --> 07:57.040
and then he catches himself, like, no...

07:57.120 --> 07:59.080
I have never...

07:59.160 --> 08:02.120
One time I've left a studio
without writing a song.

08:07.480 --> 08:10.080
Tim travels around the world for me.

08:10.160 --> 08:13.240
He travels around Europe and the US,
taking meetings.

08:13.320 --> 08:18.000
Do you feel stressed you can't live up to
Tim's expectations of you as an artist?

08:18.080 --> 08:19.400
Yeah, kind of.

08:19.480 --> 08:23.160
Or you know, that's what's great
about Tim, he's got that drive.

08:23.240 --> 08:27.400
You're new in your role
as an international artist.

08:27.480 --> 08:30.560
Tim is new in his role as manager.

08:30.640 --> 08:33.360
- I'm new in my role as creative director.
- Yeah.

08:33.440 --> 08:35.080
So, we all do what we can.

08:35.160 --> 08:37.160
Everyone's a little, not shaky,

08:37.240 --> 08:40.560
but a little, you know,
"Okay, how will we build this?"

08:50.120 --> 08:56.160
It isn't enough here to sing well and play
the piano. Here you have to be the best.

08:57.440 --> 08:58.880
Everyone is good here.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.960
Everyone plays the piano.
Everyone can sing.

09:02.040 --> 09:04.560
And I'm not a good singer, you know?

09:04.640 --> 09:07.320
There are thousands of people like me.

09:09.560 --> 09:15.280
STOCKHOLM

09:21.640 --> 09:26.480
Being here is my least favourite thing.
I can't think of anything worse.

09:28.640 --> 09:30.600
I don't get why you hate it so much.

09:30.680 --> 09:34.680
You can feel how
warm and cramped and gross it is.

09:34.760 --> 09:37.440
I just want to get out of here.

09:37.520 --> 09:40.960
I fall over when I walk in
because there's so much stuff.

09:41.040 --> 09:45.840
And it's so hot. I can't open the windows,
I'd have to take everything down.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.680
I've got my chaos organised.

09:48.680 --> 09:53.280
Where did I put my passport?
Or my ID? Or my wallet?

09:54.560 --> 09:55.880
I lost it again.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.520
Hey.

10:02.680 --> 10:06.440
OPENING OF THE SWEDISH SUMMER TOUR

10:17.280 --> 10:19.920
A 20 inch bass drum there,
a 22 inch here.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.040
One goes, "Plopp, plopp, plopp."

10:22.120 --> 10:23.840
One goes "Boom, boom boom."

10:37.440 --> 10:40.720
Will the audience here
understand what we're doing?

10:41.960 --> 10:43.280
Intro.

10:46.320 --> 10:50.200
The idea ism we'll listen, come up
with notes if we think need to...

10:50.280 --> 10:52.720
We're listening with the audience's ears.

10:59.920 --> 11:02.920
There are two things I feel right away.

11:05.560 --> 11:10.120
That, "Da da da da da da"
we've got as trackset.

11:10.200 --> 11:13.160
- Does that need to go?
- So, you don't want, like...

11:13.240 --> 11:16.040
No, that's what I want to get rid of,
they clash.

11:16.120 --> 11:18.800
- But I should "cling" the same chord?
- "Cling".

11:18.880 --> 11:20.720
I asked Zimney to remove the...

11:23.040 --> 11:25.880
You know, like... So it really becomes...

11:27.960 --> 11:30.120
Can you make it even more, like...

11:52.640 --> 11:55.280
It's 60 minutes, shut up, bang.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.080
Bass, sex.

11:57.160 --> 12:00.240
Guitar... like crazy.

12:00.320 --> 12:02.840
You... like crazy.

12:03.480 --> 12:04.800
- I love you.
- Love you.

12:04.880 --> 12:06.240
Good talk.

12:13.320 --> 12:17.040
Benjamin, Benjamin, Benjamin, Benjamin!

12:18.800 --> 12:22.880
Benjamin, Benjamin, Benjamin, Benjamin!

13:40.360 --> 13:41.680
I'm back.

13:43.280 --> 13:47.720
You don't get it, when I did that spin
with the mic stand, I just like, bam!

13:47.800 --> 13:51.440
And I see a tooth flying.
I'm just like, "No, no, no!"

13:51.520 --> 13:53.640
And I turn to the band, like this...

13:54.640 --> 13:56.240
And they're like...

13:56.320 --> 14:00.200
They thought I was telling them to smile.

14:00.280 --> 14:01.640
And they're like...

14:01.720 --> 14:03.040
"We are smiling!"

14:29.760 --> 14:33.320
Is Benjamin a little bit cute?
Are you cute, sweetie?

14:34.000 --> 14:38.080
Bianca, sweetie, are you there
with your little brother?

14:52.400 --> 14:55.160
My mum worked in the theatre
four nights a week.

14:55.240 --> 14:58.920
Usually you might have a babysitter
but I made her take me with her.

14:59.680 --> 15:03.280
The smell of those
dark red corridors of GÃ¶ta Lejon.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.880
All the stage technicians
setting up the set.

15:07.440 --> 15:12.280
A conductor sitting with the orchestra,
tuning the instruments.

15:12.360 --> 15:14.360
You hear the audience.

15:14.440 --> 15:16.160
You hear people sitting down.

15:16.240 --> 15:19.040
The curtain lights drop
and the overture begins.

15:20.040 --> 15:23.080
And I get to live in a fairytale
every night.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.240
We're filming his little dance.

15:38.120 --> 15:41.560
Benjamin has never doubted
what he'll become.

15:41.640 --> 15:45.560
He's always wanted to be on stage.

15:45.640 --> 15:47.840
There's never been any other option.

15:48.400 --> 15:51.120
If you were out walking
and saw anything raised,

15:51.200 --> 15:54.080
you knew he'd be up there and give a show.

15:54.160 --> 15:57.280
It was as if he breathed
music, theatre, dance.

16:01.840 --> 16:04.640
When you've worked with
as many actors as I have,

16:04.720 --> 16:07.840
you can determine
what's quality and what isn't.

16:07.920 --> 16:11.400
And Benjamin has something
very special in his DNA.

16:14.600 --> 16:18.760
I thought he'd be one of the world's
greatest musical theatre artists,

16:18.840 --> 16:21.080
which he absolutely could have been.

16:21.160 --> 16:25.280
But I understood early on that he was
more focused on becoming an artist,

16:25.360 --> 16:28.280
writing songs, having that career.

16:45.680 --> 16:48.760
- We're going in a loop plane.
- Like, upside down?

16:49.320 --> 16:52.120
Should I really expose myself
to this before a gig?

16:52.200 --> 16:55.640
Yes, it's the coolest thing
you'll experience in your life.

17:02.440 --> 17:03.840
And this is safe?

17:03.920 --> 17:05.600
- What?
- It's safe?

17:05.680 --> 17:07.040
- It'll be great.
- Okay.

17:33.280 --> 17:35.280
That's so fucking cool!

17:42.080 --> 17:43.400
Damn!

17:47.200 --> 17:48.520
So cool!

17:55.240 --> 17:57.800
- Thank you so much.
- You did good.

17:59.160 --> 18:00.480
I'm so dizzy.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.200
I'm gonna go throw up.

18:04.800 --> 18:06.120
See you.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.400
- Get better soon!
- Yeah, you too.

19:36.200 --> 19:40.000
Back when I was listening to them.
I was such a fucking fan.

19:40.080 --> 19:43.600
And now I'm making an album with them.
That's pretty cool.

19:53.800 --> 19:56.520
Maybe if we wanted to try
the chorus more like,

19:56.600 --> 19:58.920
"I feel alive! Can you feel it?"

19:59.000 --> 20:02.680
Make it even more obvious
that it's like, choir.

20:08.320 --> 20:10.560
Exactly, should we start from the top?

20:11.120 --> 20:12.920
We'll try.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.320
Yes.

20:16.200 --> 20:17.720
It's like, syncopation.

20:31.360 --> 20:34.080
You'd almost want like a... Kind of.

20:39.320 --> 20:42.000
Mhm it's like...

20:46.480 --> 20:50.280
This is what happens when Benjamin
comes in. He comes in like...

20:50.360 --> 20:55.200
Then he starts and he gets going
and there's a lot of starting like this...

20:55.280 --> 20:57.000
Then up through the floor...

20:57.080 --> 20:59.440
This is how I imagine the music video...

21:04.520 --> 21:08.320
He's good at painting
a clear picture, visually.

21:08.400 --> 21:10.440
Now it's like this...

21:10.520 --> 21:14.000
It could be like that,
but in some kind of water, you know.

21:19.320 --> 21:23.200
We often get 451 voice memos.

21:23.280 --> 21:27.760
And also often voice memos when it seems
he's playing at his mum's place.

21:27.840 --> 21:30.280
- Yeah.
- Why doesn't he have his own piano?

21:30.360 --> 21:32.040
He should be able to have...

21:32.120 --> 21:35.280
Then there are voice memos
where he's really winded,

21:35.360 --> 21:39.480
singing a melody at the same time
that he's showing a drum beat

21:39.560 --> 21:42.280
and a bass line and a fill.

21:42.360 --> 21:46.720
And then where the fireworks
should come in in the last chorus.

21:46.800 --> 21:48.120
Exactly.

22:07.440 --> 22:12.000
SKANSEN STOCKHOLM

22:13.000 --> 22:19.600
When I was 10 or 11 years old,
I was on this stage with my mum.

22:19.680 --> 22:24.240
And I ran along the whole catwalk,
like, "Come on, Skansen!"

22:24.320 --> 22:25.920
It was full.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.920
Then, about seven or eight years later,

22:29.000 --> 22:33.120
I was on this stage,
yelled, "Come on, Skansen!"

22:33.200 --> 22:35.440
There weren't as many fans.

22:35.520 --> 22:39.640
Then, eight years after that,
tonight, I can yell.

22:39.720 --> 22:41.440
Come on, Skansen!

22:43.600 --> 22:45.280
I can't hear you in the back!

22:47.600 --> 22:49.600
Skansen, I think we can be louder!

22:51.800 --> 22:54.120
Come on, Skansen, I want it boiling!

22:55.920 --> 22:57.400
Louder, Skansen!

22:59.680 --> 23:01.480
Louder, Skansen!

23:42.160 --> 23:43.680
I love you!

24:00.560 --> 24:02.400
- I love you!
- I love you.

24:02.480 --> 24:03.800
Let's go in.

24:04.400 --> 24:08.480
- It looked like you had a lot of fun.
- I did but I was also distracted.

24:08.560 --> 24:11.760
Damnit. In my head,

24:11.840 --> 24:15.720
it's like I had a devil on my shoulder

24:15.800 --> 24:21.240
telling me I was bad and couldn't
move and that people, you know...

24:21.320 --> 24:26.400
There was so much tension about wanting
a redo from when I was here last.

24:26.480 --> 24:29.560
- And you got that.
- Yes, I know, it was largely about...

24:29.640 --> 24:32.880
you know, I made a small mistake
in the first song.

24:32.960 --> 24:36.080
And it stays with me,
so I make another in the second.

24:36.160 --> 24:40.680
It's not a mistake anyone notices,
it's just that I'm not 100% present.

24:40.760 --> 24:46.000
I've got someone watching me
from the outside, just like, you know...

25:03.040 --> 25:06.400
Yes and Jossan has been packing
my clothes and everything.

25:07.560 --> 25:08.880
Yes.

25:10.040 --> 25:11.840
It's so strange.

25:15.560 --> 25:18.160
A real apartment that I own.

25:19.360 --> 25:21.880
- Alright then.
- Welcome.

25:21.960 --> 25:24.400
- Can I keep my shoes on?
- Yeah, go for it.

25:32.520 --> 25:33.840
What?!

26:02.920 --> 26:04.800
What do I do when I'm by myself?

26:08.080 --> 26:09.840
Do I watch a movie? No.

26:11.560 --> 26:13.240
Do I cook? No.

26:15.080 --> 26:18.360
I'd rather be surrounded by people.

26:19.720 --> 26:22.080
I can be pleasant and social.

26:23.960 --> 26:25.280
I can't reach.

26:31.240 --> 26:34.840
When I'm by myself
I don't really know who I am.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.000
I'm fucking here now!

27:09.280 --> 27:12.240
I fall in love on the ceiling.

27:12.320 --> 27:16.840
<i>Call you mine is all I want to do.</i>
<i>I can fly...</i>

27:16.920 --> 27:18.240
You know.

27:18.320 --> 27:19.480
I can fly.

27:19.560 --> 27:22.600
- Does it feel good, playing this one?
- Yeah.

27:22.680 --> 27:24.760
Yeah.

27:24.840 --> 27:28.040
- Great.
- We tried some of this...

27:28.120 --> 27:30.480
- For the chorus.
- That's great.

27:30.560 --> 27:32.720
If it sounds like shit, just say.

27:32.800 --> 27:34.560
I will.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.720
I'd really like to get out...

28:00.640 --> 28:01.960
Even more?

28:02.960 --> 28:06.200
- And what are you playing there?
- I'm playing that too.

28:10.920 --> 28:15.560
Maybe it's that plonging
that's a little too bright?

28:15.640 --> 28:16.960
Okay.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.800
What happens if
you're in some kind of brass?

28:43.920 --> 28:45.560
You're so damn good.

28:47.480 --> 28:52.800
I've never released anything that sounds
this international. Or this good.

28:52.880 --> 28:55.160
It won't do well here, at home.

28:55.240 --> 28:57.840
People don't want to
hear me in English here.

28:58.400 --> 29:03.640
It won't. I'll barely even be
looking at the top 50s on Saturday.

29:03.720 --> 29:05.640
SWEDISH RADIO

29:05.720 --> 29:07.440
Good morning everyone.

29:07.520 --> 29:12.960
It's Friday, January 26 and it's still
pretty dark outside but it's a sunny day

29:13.040 --> 29:17.000
because I'm releasing
my first single in two years. Kite.

29:17.560 --> 29:18.880
Kite.

29:21.360 --> 29:22.800
Thirty seconds.

29:27.680 --> 29:29.000
Twenty.

29:33.040 --> 29:36.080
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

29:36.160 --> 29:39.480
six, five, four...

29:56.160 --> 29:59.160
BENJAMIN INGROSSO NEW RELEASE IN ENGLISH

30:16.920 --> 30:20.560
This is his first
real new song in two years.

30:20.640 --> 30:25.440
He's been talking for years
about wanting to make it abroad.

30:25.520 --> 30:29.320
If you have the song with capital S,
you have a chance.

30:29.400 --> 30:32.200
And I would say
this is the song with capital S.

30:35.160 --> 30:37.000
You're getting amazing reviews.

30:37.080 --> 30:40.600
It's number one right now,
which is pretty unreal to me.

30:45.520 --> 30:47.840
- Congratulations.
- Our first song.

30:48.880 --> 30:53.640
What's happening now?
It's fun, we can see if it's updated.

30:55.440 --> 30:58.560
- In Denmark, it's top six.
- Wow, that's amazing.

30:58.640 --> 31:00.600
- Third in Norway.
- No?

31:00.680 --> 31:03.600
In Poland, you're top 10.
What other countries?

31:03.680 --> 31:05.720
In the Netherlands we're 18th.

31:06.280 --> 31:08.120
Finally the day arrived.

31:09.360 --> 31:13.840
It's here.
We've now unveiled the next era.

31:13.920 --> 31:15.240
Officially.

31:18.960 --> 31:21.000
We've listened through every song,

31:21.080 --> 31:25.280
I'm thinking we can do a quick run
through and just choose where they fit.

31:25.360 --> 31:26.920
Let's start from the top.

31:27.000 --> 31:29.240
- What's the name of the song?
- Starlight.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.320
What? Starlight?

31:31.400 --> 31:33.760
- Yes.
- I've written a song called Starlight?

31:33.840 --> 31:35.280
Cardboard Box, no.

31:35.360 --> 31:38.400
If this doesn't become a hit, fuck me.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.720
Backwards I think is a no.
It's a good song though.

31:42.800 --> 31:47.440
Starlight, goodbye for this album.
It is a hit, but the production is chaos.

31:47.520 --> 31:52.640
There might be too much to work on with
that one. The last chorus is really good.

31:52.720 --> 31:58.000
That's crazy, we've thrown out songs
today. Isn't that progress in itself?

31:58.080 --> 32:01.760
Yeah, we've ditched 30 songs
by ditching the B-list.

32:05.160 --> 32:11.080
BENJAMIN AND HIS MANAGER TIM
SET OUT TO INTRODUCE THEIR NEW MUSIC

32:11.160 --> 32:14.400
TO INDUSTRY LEADERS ACROSS EUROPE

32:14.480 --> 32:19.320
We're in Berlin at the
Universal Headquarters office.

32:19.400 --> 32:25.840
We're gonna have some kind of meeting with
some big shots and play them some songs.

32:37.920 --> 32:41.080
FRANK BRIEGMANN
CEO Universal Central Europe

32:42.080 --> 32:44.960
That's great.
That makes you move real quick.

32:45.040 --> 32:47.480
- Yeah!
- I mean, the instant you hear it...

32:49.160 --> 32:54.120
I've been writing 120 songs
and we scratch maybe 100 of them.

32:54.200 --> 32:57.720
The new music is like
made for me as a performer.

32:57.800 --> 32:59.640
As you know it is a pop market.

32:59.720 --> 33:02.920
He feels like some Bond villain,
with so much power.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.480
The only thing missing was his little cat.

33:09.560 --> 33:10.880
I'll make you big.

33:16.560 --> 33:20.120
Sweden, we have a long,
proud history of exporting

33:20.200 --> 33:24.440
groups, bands, female pop artists,
songwriters, producers.

33:24.520 --> 33:28.960
But there's one thing we've never ever
done before, exporting a male pop artist.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.000
And that's why we're here today.

33:33.240 --> 33:36.000
When we started working together,
we wanted to find

33:36.080 --> 33:38.680
what's Benjamin outside of Sweden.

33:38.760 --> 33:42.800
We're on a mission to do something
that has never been done before.

33:42.880 --> 33:44.760
Merry Christmas. Happy midsummer.

33:46.600 --> 33:48.200
We're in Paris.

33:48.280 --> 33:51.960
We were in London earlier today.

33:52.040 --> 33:57.320
Next week we're going to Italy and the
week after that we'll be in Amsterdam.

33:57.880 --> 34:02.280
I've always seen myself as an entertainer
more than just an artist or songwriter.

34:02.360 --> 34:04.120
I see myself doing the dance songs,

34:04.200 --> 34:08.920
but also, I can sit at the grand piano and
do the last song together with the arena.

34:09.000 --> 34:10.680
Like a "Hey Jude" kind of thing.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.440
Look here.

34:18.880 --> 34:21.360
Hold your arms like you're taking it.

34:23.480 --> 34:24.800
Thanks.

34:26.800 --> 34:29.000
You could spread your legs even more.

34:43.800 --> 34:49.240
Meeting in London. Meeting in Paris.
Back here to party until 11.

34:54.800 --> 34:57.560
I'm taking a long view on my artistry.

34:57.640 --> 34:59.560
To me it's like a new chapter.

34:59.640 --> 35:02.360
I'm very excited
about everything that's coming.

35:02.440 --> 35:04.800
- How are you doing?
- Yeah, I'm doing well.

35:37.720 --> 35:39.040
I'm a big lie.

35:44.320 --> 35:47.560
If people had seen this side of me...

35:53.240 --> 35:56.280
My face looks pale, red and ugly.

35:59.160 --> 36:02.000
This is what I look...
This is the real me.

36:02.080 --> 36:03.400
Why... Like...

36:05.080 --> 36:06.560
Fuck!

36:06.640 --> 36:08.280
I hate this fucking...

36:16.680 --> 36:20.080
I can't deal with people thinking,
"Oh, did he put on weight?"

36:20.160 --> 36:22.600
or "Wow, he's so ugly in real life."

36:32.400 --> 36:39.360
<i>The winner of MGP Junior 2006 is</i>
<i>Benjamin Wahlgren Ingrosso with Hej Sofia!</i>

36:42.320 --> 36:44.320
I had no friends in school.

36:47.280 --> 36:51.240
So when I won MGP Junior,
that was huge to me.

36:51.320 --> 36:55.880
I seriously thought I'd come to school and
people would be like, "Congratulations!"

36:55.960 --> 37:00.240
But when I came to school, it was
dead silent and people are laughing at me.

37:00.320 --> 37:03.680
Someone started a Facebook group
which had 15,000 followers.

37:03.760 --> 37:06.400
"We who hate Benjamin Wahlgren Ingrosso".

37:09.480 --> 37:11.800
It really got to me, what people wrote.

37:11.880 --> 37:14.600
"That peppy little kid,
he's so gross. I hate it".

37:14.680 --> 37:16.720
"I hate that entire family,

37:16.800 --> 37:20.840
but that little guy with the hat,
he's the finishing touch."

37:20.920 --> 37:22.800
"He's fat and pale and gross."

37:27.240 --> 37:28.560
Just you wait...

37:41.920 --> 37:45.680
My entire life has been about
changing people's perception.

37:54.960 --> 37:58.320
Those are the comments I see
in my head when I'm on stage.

38:03.640 --> 38:06.160
That's exactly how I felt.

38:06.240 --> 38:09.320
But for one hour I felt,
"I'm gonna fucking show them."

38:09.400 --> 38:11.080
And that's not fun either.

38:11.160 --> 38:14.760
Then you just have that fake smile.

38:16.680 --> 38:18.840
I had fun but also a lot of self doubt.

38:18.920 --> 38:22.520
You probably think I'm just
some big douche in a pink t-shirt.

38:39.160 --> 38:42.040
What's with the attitude?
You're in the front row.

38:59.160 --> 39:03.200
- It's just in your head.
- It's not just in my fucking head! Please!

39:14.800 --> 39:17.600
It's crazy to see someone at the top,

39:17.680 --> 39:22.240
and how it still doesn't
give you security and love.

39:22.320 --> 39:25.320
It just goes to show
that everyone is fucking human,

39:25.400 --> 39:30.040
it doesn't matter how much fame you have,
how many people are clapping for you.

39:33.040 --> 39:37.120
So many people are always talking
about this happiness around Benjamin.

39:37.200 --> 39:39.320
Happy Benjamin. And he is.

39:39.400 --> 39:44.880
But there's this extreme
self critical self-hatred.

39:50.640 --> 39:54.520
All these characters
he's been since he was like four.

39:54.600 --> 39:59.640
Either it's a way to find himself,
or it's just a long escape.

40:13.280 --> 40:14.760
Shit, I don't know.

40:17.840 --> 40:19.680
Yes, of course I'm happy.

40:19.760 --> 40:22.880
I don't want to look back on this
when I'm older, thinking,

40:22.960 --> 40:27.400
"I barely remember that because
I was so caught up in something else."

40:27.480 --> 40:33.200
But yesterday I was up there crying,
because I was so proud of myself.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.400
So I guess I had that little moment.

41:05.320 --> 41:10.760
LOS ANGELES

41:10.840 --> 41:12.320
Good day!

41:12.400 --> 41:14.160
- Hello, sir.
- How are you guys?

41:14.240 --> 41:18.080
Look who it is, Mr Baby. It's a pop star.

41:20.360 --> 41:24.680
I have a bit of a structure already
in my head when it comes to the song.

41:24.760 --> 41:29.400
I hear this song being the intro, like,

41:29.480 --> 41:32.920
starting two minutes
before the song even starts like...

41:36.400 --> 41:37.720
Yes.

41:40.160 --> 41:41.480
Yes.

41:43.040 --> 41:47.240
The only thing is like a kind of a...

41:47.320 --> 41:48.640
Yeah.

41:53.440 --> 41:54.440
Fuck yeah.

41:54.520 --> 41:56.880
I know you know, it kind of shows,

41:56.960 --> 41:59.440
I'm the angel,
I'm the devil, I'm the joke.

41:59.520 --> 42:04.160
Roll out of bed, I just got dressed,
I'm still the same me, forget the rest.

42:04.240 --> 42:05.560
Sure.

42:40.400 --> 42:42.360
This is so much of where I come from.

42:42.440 --> 42:45.880
The theatre, musicals, ABBA,
you know, Freddy Mercury.

42:45.960 --> 42:51.080
There is so much uncool in it,
which I die for.

42:52.320 --> 42:53.840
- This...
- Which is cool.

42:53.920 --> 42:57.440
Yes, but I'm not trying to be
someone here. This is Benjamin.

43:00.040 --> 43:02.680
Maybe just like,
"Look who's laughing now."

43:02.760 --> 43:05.200
Yeah, that'd be cool, yeah.

43:17.560 --> 43:24.520
STOCKHOLM
FINAL SHOW OF THE SWEDISH TOUR

43:29.280 --> 43:30.600
Look.

43:31.760 --> 43:33.320
That looks so good.

43:35.440 --> 43:37.440
I love that it's just implied too.

43:37.520 --> 43:40.360
It's like Matrix meets Elvis Presley.

43:40.440 --> 43:44.640
Everyone's going to ask,
"Where the hell did you get that?"

43:51.600 --> 43:53.600
- How does it feel?
- I'm so excited.

43:53.680 --> 43:56.440
It's going to be so much fun.
The ultimate redo.

43:56.520 --> 43:57.840
Oh, is this a redo?

43:57.920 --> 44:02.080
Yes, I played here
in 2019 with Felix Sandman.

44:02.720 --> 44:04.480
- Worst gig of my life.
- Was it?

44:04.560 --> 44:06.720
Yeah.

44:06.800 --> 44:08.120
So...

44:08.200 --> 44:11.480
No, but I thought everyone
was here for him.

44:11.560 --> 44:16.760
People had "Felix" written on their
foreheads. People didn't sing along.

44:16.840 --> 44:19.360
I had really bad
self-confidence back then.

45:40.520 --> 45:42.160
Thank you for tonight!

46:03.640 --> 46:06.640
I chase these kicks to get affirmation.

46:06.720 --> 46:08.880
I've been doing it since I was seven.

46:08.960 --> 46:12.200
I'm pretty tired of constantly chasing.

46:14.880 --> 46:18.920
If I'm having success in Sweden,
that I've been chasing since I was little,

46:19.000 --> 46:24.000
and said, "No, I'll have my break abroad,
then the Swedes will see I'm talented."

46:24.080 --> 46:29.280
But if they already get that, why should I
aim to be a world famous artist?

46:29.360 --> 46:32.000
It feels like I'll just burn out.

46:37.840 --> 46:42.600
2024, we'll start breaking into Europe.

46:42.680 --> 46:47.600
2025, we'll have conquered Europe
and starting to break into the US.

46:47.680 --> 46:50.000
2026...

46:50.080 --> 46:52.520
That's when we'll take this fucking city.

47:25.000 --> 47:28.280
