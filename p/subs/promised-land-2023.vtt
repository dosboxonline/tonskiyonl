WEBVTT

01:41.626 --> 01:47.042
- Your Majesty. The carriage is waiting.
- Yes please. We'll drive when I'm ready.

01:56.167 --> 01:59.542
Ludvig Kahlen, we are ready for you.

02:11.751 --> 02:14.709
Chancellor of Paul

02:18.917 --> 02:21.209
So who do we have here?

02:21.376 --> 02:25.917
Captain Kahlen has returned home after
25 years of service in the German army.

02:26.084 --> 02:30.751
He is applying for permission to
to build on the Jutland heath.

02:35.459 --> 02:40.251
Nice, nice drawings, soldier.
It's just a waste of your time.

02:40.417 --> 02:45.084
- The heath cannot be cultivated.
- All land can be cultivated.

02:46.126 --> 02:50.376
A third of the kingdom lies
deserted. It's a blemish.

02:50.542 --> 02:56.209
I can subdue the earth. I can
build the first colony on the heath.

02:56.376 --> 03:01.167
This is nothing but heather
and stones and sand. Nothing can grow there.

03:01.334 --> 03:05.667
It has been proven time and time again
of better men than you.

03:07.126 --> 03:11.209
With all due respect, I would like to ask for
to represent the king himself.

03:11.376 --> 03:16.626
Yes of course. Is anybody there
is nice to call on His Majesty?

03:18.626 --> 03:22.542
We don't waste any more of the state's
money to cultivate the heath.

03:22.709 --> 03:28.501
Especially not on a conceited soldier
in a shabby uniform. Get him out.

03:30.584 --> 03:35.417
I'm not asking you for a penny.
I finance it myself.

03:35.584 --> 03:39.459
- How?
- I have my captain's pension.

03:42.501 --> 03:45.042
It's nothing.

03:48.876 --> 03:52.292
Let's say you succeed
to build a colony.

03:52.459 --> 03:57.459
What do you think should be the reward
for your generous offer?

03:59.792 --> 04:05.334
A noble title with associated estates
and servants.

04:08.084 --> 04:11.209
Would you like to wait outside please?

04:19.625 --> 04:24.042
He is nobody. His mother was
maid in a manor house.

04:24.209 --> 04:27.459
He became a seaman,
until he joined the German army.

04:27.626 --> 04:31.334
He managed to stay
captain despite his low status.

04:31.501 --> 04:35.042
- His demands are crazy.
- The requirements don't matter.

04:35.209 --> 04:41.084
We could promise him to be emperor.
There is no one who can cultivate that land.

04:41.251 --> 04:45.709
But as long as he's out there,
then we can say to His Majesty, -

04:45.876 --> 04:50.292
- that we are still fighting for
his beloved heath project.

04:56.084 --> 04:57.959
(door opens)

04:58.126 --> 05:02.584
Captain Kahlen, come inside.
We have good news.

05:55.251 --> 05:57.334
(thunder)

06:43.459 --> 06:45.751
Help! Help me!

07:02.459 --> 07:04.292
(branch breaks)

07:11.042 --> 07:16.959
A little telmaj for a poor man
little dill all alone in the forest.

07:18.126 --> 07:23.334
What a fine bings you are.
You must have lots of money.

07:35.876 --> 07:38.376
(shout and whistle)

09:06.542 --> 09:11.751
Why the hell did you choose
to build a house right in my county?

09:11.917 --> 09:14.667
The hands of the diligent shall prevail.

09:24.084 --> 09:27.792
- What's in the boxes?
- I wanted to know that too.

09:27.959 --> 09:30.709
They came all the way from Mecklenburg.

09:30.876 --> 09:34.917
I do not understand
all that secrecy.

09:35.667 --> 09:38.209
Are these all my men?

09:38.417 --> 09:43.501
I need more than that if
The house must be ready before autumn.

09:43.709 --> 09:48.584
No enterprising men want out
to kill himself out on the heath.

09:48.751 --> 09:54.417
I need three times as many.
Then you have to find them in the neighboring towns.

09:54.584 --> 09:59.251
I have buttock boils the size of
swan eggs. They do not thrive on the road.

09:59.417 --> 10:05.126
In addition, the forests are teeming with outlaws.
Before I forget. Five Riksdaler.

10:05.292 --> 10:10.417
As county commissioner, I must be compensated for
my toil in getting everything on the list.

10:10.584 --> 10:14.667
Plus horses to transport
all that shit to the world's arsehole.

10:14.834 --> 10:17.417
Yes, sorry, priest.

10:18.792 --> 10:21.667
Captain, may I show you something?

10:21.834 --> 10:25.376
I have the solution
on your problem with manpower.

10:25.542 --> 10:29.751
You have no idea how happy I am,
that you have chosen our parish.

10:29.917 --> 10:33.334
It is high time
that God's light shines on the heath.

10:36.042 --> 10:40.292
Come on. I think,
I have found a home for you.

10:49.334 --> 10:54.626
Johannes Eriksen, an experienced farmer,
and his wife, Ann Barbara.

10:57.459 --> 11:01.167
It is illegal
to hire refugees.

11:04.126 --> 11:07.167
They have fled from a brutal master.

11:07.334 --> 11:12.334
Eriksen can work hard, and Ann
Barbara is a skilled housekeeper.

11:12.501 --> 11:16.126
We can work for half time, sir.

11:16.334 --> 11:21.709
We only ask for our own chamber, so Ann
Barbara should not sleep with the men.

11:22.751 --> 11:26.292
a chamber,
two meals a day, no salary.

11:26.459 --> 11:29.959
You won't get a better opportunity
in your situation.

11:30.126 --> 11:33.834
I get visits from important people
men when the house is finished.

11:34.001 --> 11:38.459
I expect,
it is held to a high standard.

11:38.626 --> 11:40.876
Is that understood?

11:48.417 --> 11:53.876
It will be OK. They never will
looking for you on the heath.

12:17.417 --> 12:22.417
Well, Bondo. I stand here as someone else
idiot and wasting the best season.

12:22.584 --> 12:24.709
It's now that the cheeks are flaring.

12:24.876 --> 12:30.042
Bear portraits are high fashion
i whole Nordeurope, mr. de Schinkel.

12:30.209 --> 12:34.084
- Where is my cousin?
- She is out lunging her horse.

12:34.251 --> 12:37.751
She does nothing but
to run around with the damn horse.

12:37.917 --> 12:43.834
There is a Captain Kahlen who is
in the process of building a house on the moor.

12:44.001 --> 12:47.667
"King's House" he calls it.

12:47.834 --> 12:51.334
You said no
more crazies would come.

12:51.501 --> 12:56.376
That it was a matter of time,
before we could buy it all.

12:58.042 --> 13:02.126
- Bald ones?
- Yes. Ludwig Kahlen.

13:03.209 --> 13:07.209
- Find out who he is.
- Of course.

13:36.001 --> 13:39.709
I have had better stowage in the army.

13:39.876 --> 13:43.251
If you had bought a cow,
had we had thicker milk.

13:43.417 --> 13:46.542
If I have to keep the house,
do i need a cow

13:46.709 --> 13:50.542
I have made a detailed account
above my budget out here.

13:50.709 --> 13:54.167
If a cow was needed,
had there been a cow.

13:54.334 --> 13:57.334
It does not get better.

14:12.542 --> 14:15.626
Everything must be in neat, small rows.

14:15.792 --> 14:21.209
The floor must be dust-free, the food
lie perfectly in the middle of the plate.

14:22.917 --> 14:26.167
He behaves
like a fine gentleman, -

14:26.334 --> 14:30.459
- but his clothes are worn,
and his hands are rough.

14:32.126 --> 14:36.376
- He's strange.
- The priest says we can trust him.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.667
We can't trust anyone.

14:39.834 --> 14:43.209
We will never get away from here without IÃ¸n.

14:46.001 --> 14:52.001
We stay here just one season. Just
until they are not looking for us anymore.

14:58.209 --> 15:01.084
One season at Kongenshus.

15:01.251 --> 15:05.417
Then we head towards the coast.
I want to see the sea.

15:07.459 --> 15:09.959
I want to see the sea.

15:20.917 --> 15:23.001
Where are you going?

15:23.167 --> 15:27.501
Out to our strange gentleman.
He shouldn't go out there alone.

15:42.792 --> 15:47.042
- They will need marl.
- We collect clay out by the sea.

15:47.209 --> 15:50.126
The heather must be burned,
the soil must be fertilized.

15:50.292 --> 15:53.751
It takes at least half a year,
before anything can be cultivated.

15:53.917 --> 15:57.667
May I ask,
what are you planning to grow?

15:57.834 --> 16:00.501
You are welcome to ask.

16:00.667 --> 16:03.626
But you get no answer.

16:19.001 --> 16:21.209
(chickens cluck)

16:25.792 --> 16:28.334
Come here!

16:28.501 --> 16:31.709
Thanks for the damn hen, bings!

16:31.876 --> 16:34.667
- What happens?
- It's the outlaws.

16:37.209 --> 16:39.667
What the hell are you guys doing?

16:39.834 --> 16:43.959
Now all outlaws know,
that they can just come here and steal.

16:44.126 --> 16:46.709
Why did you let her go?

16:46.876 --> 16:51.667
You must not get too close
the kind of. The devil watches over them.

16:51.834 --> 16:56.709
- You saw for yourself how dark she was.
- Shut up. She is a beggar child.

16:56.876 --> 17:00.751
They pick them up south.
Next time you stop her.

17:00.917 --> 17:06.001
We shall have no curse
on us. You can stop her yourself.

17:06.876 --> 17:10.126
Pack your things. You are done here.

17:12.126 --> 17:14.001
(bell rings)

17:15.041 --> 17:18.626
You are doing something amazing.

17:18.791 --> 17:21.959
You can already feel life out here.

17:29.917 --> 17:33.376
Johannes. Isn't that Preisler?

17:35.417 --> 17:39.167
Johannes. please
to look after my horse in the barn.

17:55.459 --> 17:57.459
Captain Kahlen?

17:57.626 --> 18:02.126
Major Preisler. I'm here on behalf of
by Frederik de Schinkel of Hald.

18:02.292 --> 18:06.167
Owner of 130 farms
and the county judge of the region.

18:06.334 --> 18:11.709
Sir. de Schinkel has asked me to invite
you for dinner at the estate tonight.

18:11.876 --> 18:14.834
It would be an honor for me.

18:15.001 --> 18:19.501
- I hope you have some other clothes.
- I have my uniform.

18:25.501 --> 18:29.084
One of Mr. de Schinkel's tenant farmers
ran away recently.

18:29.251 --> 18:32.959
Rumor has it,
he is still here in the area.

18:33.126 --> 18:37.292
Johannes Eriksen and his wife.
Does that tell you anything?

18:37.459 --> 18:40.376
I have the men you see here.

18:54.959 --> 18:58.709
Schinkel.
Is he the one they ran away from?

18:58.876 --> 19:04.667
The most important man here in the area? The
man i should stay friends with?

19:43.001 --> 19:48.959
My uncle loved dogs. He got
written into his will, -

19:49.126 --> 19:53.459
- that Frederik was not allowed to remove
a single dog portrait.

19:53.626 --> 19:58.417
I think he was happier
for his dogs than his own children.

19:58.584 --> 20:01.917
Edel Helene Leising,
Frederik's cousin.

20:03.626 --> 20:06.251
Captain Ludvig Kahlen.

20:08.001 --> 20:11.334
Are you related to
the Norwegian Count Leising?

20:11.501 --> 20:16.167
That is my dad. They might know
much to the Norwegian nobility?

20:16.334 --> 20:21.501
No... Only what everyone knows.
That your father is a close friend of the king.

20:31.709 --> 20:33.792
Here he is.

20:36.376 --> 20:39.626
Ludvig Kahlen.
Welcome to Hald Gods.

20:39.792 --> 20:43.251
- National judge Schinkel...
- De Schinkel.

20:43.417 --> 20:47.417
My father's name was Schinkel, but I
have changed it to de Schinkel.

20:47.584 --> 20:50.501
De Schinkel, sorry.

20:50.667 --> 20:54.542
From gardener to decorated captain
is quite an achievement.

20:54.709 --> 20:57.376
It also took me 25 years.

20:58.417 --> 21:03.584
25 years. Do you know how long
does it take a noble to become a captain?

21:03.751 --> 21:05.834
Six months.

21:06.959 --> 21:10.917
You must have hated those powder puffs,
who advanced before you, -

21:11.126 --> 21:14.459
- just because they had
the real blood in the veins.

21:14.626 --> 21:18.584
- Those are the rules.
- Said by a real soldier.

21:27.376 --> 21:31.959
So... you want to try farming the heath?

21:32.126 --> 21:35.251
I want to build
the king's first colony out there.

21:35.417 --> 21:41.084
The heath is God's nature in all its splendor.
Why castrate a wild animal?

21:41.251 --> 21:45.876
Didn't God just put man
on earth to create civilization?

21:46.042 --> 21:49.209
So we're not civilized out here?

21:49.376 --> 21:54.834
God has nothing to do with civilization
to do. God is chaos. Life is chaos.

21:56.667 --> 21:59.084
I do not agree.

21:59.251 --> 22:03.709
You fought in the Silesian Wars.
Was it civilized?

22:03.876 --> 22:06.042
No, war is chaos.

22:06.209 --> 22:11.042
But the winner is the one who can
figure out how to control chaos.

22:20.959 --> 22:25.209
What do you think of my fiancÃ©?
Isn't she beautiful to look at?

22:25.376 --> 22:30.042
Are we engaged? I can not remember,
I have said yes, Frederik.

22:30.209 --> 22:32.917
As if it wasn't settled.

22:33.084 --> 22:37.792
Her father begged me to
to take her. Not that I'm complaining.

22:39.459 --> 22:45.209
Her family wants my fortune,
but I drew the longest straw.

22:45.376 --> 22:50.001
Getting into the noble circles
is invaluable. That's what my father said.

22:50.167 --> 22:55.167
- Your father was right.
- He created this from nothing.

22:55.334 --> 22:57.876
Two cows and a plough.

22:58.042 --> 23:02.042
Now he just lies
and rots in the ground.

23:02.209 --> 23:04.459
Life is chaos, Ludvig.

23:04.667 --> 23:10.001
Cunt, dick, shit, blood, chaos.

23:12.042 --> 23:14.667
We can't control shit.

23:14.834 --> 23:20.584
It is only when we recognize that
that we can enjoy our insignificant lives.

23:20.751 --> 23:26.626
Everything you've said since we set
us to the table, it has been ridiculous.

23:29.167 --> 23:35.084
Pardon. My cousin needs
a lesson in civilized behavior.

23:37.251 --> 23:39.792
Why am I here?

23:39.959 --> 23:44.917
You are here because you have built
on my land without permission.

23:45.084 --> 23:48.417
- Your land?
- Yes, de Schinkel's Jordan.

23:48.584 --> 23:52.501
The heath belongs to the king.
All uncultivated land belongs to the king.

23:52.667 --> 23:55.834
Are you a little bit deaf?
This is my land.

23:56.001 --> 23:59.751
- Do you have a land registry card?
- I can't bear to find it.

23:59.917 --> 24:04.959
- Then we have to get a surveyor up here...
- Or we can ask the county judge.

24:05.126 --> 24:08.001
The national judge judges,
it is good enough.

24:08.209 --> 24:12.292
We have nothing more to talk about.
Miss Edel...

24:12.459 --> 24:17.001
Your mother was a kitchen maid
Count Raven's estate, wasn't she?

24:17.167 --> 24:19.834
He was a friend of the family.

24:20.001 --> 24:25.167
A God-given scapegoat who took
for himself of all resorting to a lap, -

24:25.334 --> 24:29.126
- and you are
as cheated out of his nose.

24:30.167 --> 24:32.834
It's almost creepy.

24:33.001 --> 24:35.834
He was the one who sent you into the army?

24:36.001 --> 24:39.334
My father did
with his bastards.

24:39.501 --> 24:45.834
My little half-brothers with longing
eyes and soil under the nails.

24:46.001 --> 24:51.001
And now the bastard wants to be
a big man out on the heath.

24:52.209 --> 24:56.251
What do you get if you succeed?
And gods?

24:57.292 --> 25:01.792
En fin title? "From" Bald ones?

25:08.626 --> 25:11.209
- What is it?
- A contract.

25:11.376 --> 25:14.042
You try your luck
on Mr. de Schinkel's land.

25:14.209 --> 25:18.001
He will help you with men,
provisions and materials.

25:18.167 --> 25:21.751
In return, you pay
50% of your future income.

25:21.917 --> 25:26.792
Should colonists come, stay
the tenant farmers of Mr. de Schinkel.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.792
No thank you.

25:28.959 --> 25:32.959
I would strongly advise you
to accept the offer.

25:33.126 --> 25:36.751
It is the king's land.
I work for the king.

25:36.917 --> 25:38.917
Vovvov.

25:52.667 --> 25:57.501
There are not many who dare to say
Frederik opposed in that way.

26:04.126 --> 26:08.709
- See you again, Captain?
- I don't see how.

26:08.876 --> 26:13.876
There is a harvest festival in a month.
All the powder puffs are coming.

26:15.459 --> 26:20.042
- First Sunday in September.
- I don't think I'm invited.

26:20.209 --> 26:25.584
You can come as my guest.
I can invite whoever I want.

26:29.084 --> 26:32.667
Here. So you don't forget me
in the meantime.

27:10.167 --> 27:14.667
Why is no one working?
Where are the men?

27:14.834 --> 27:20.292
Major Preisler knocked on my door
and told me to get out of here immediately -

27:20.459 --> 27:25.626
- and offer your men double wages
on one of de Schinkel's farms.

27:25.792 --> 27:28.959
And you did that without hesitation?

27:29.126 --> 27:35.376
I have been riding all night. Will you
stop shooting the messenger?

27:37.334 --> 27:40.709
You couldn't know
that it was his land.

27:40.876 --> 27:45.459
We are not finding any new workers.
No one dares to go up against Schinkel.

27:45.626 --> 27:50.334
Has everyone gone mad? I have
the king's stamp on, I must be here.

27:50.501 --> 27:54.376
- I have the law on my side.
- It does not matter.

27:54.542 --> 28:00.376
Does Frederik Schinkel want something,
he keeps going until he gets it.

28:00.542 --> 28:05.126
He's all alone out there now. He has
didn't even get the heather burned off.

28:05.292 --> 28:09.626
He can have a maximum of 100 Riksdalers
remaining of his captain's pension.

28:09.792 --> 28:16.251
- 100 Riksdalers? That is nothing.
- No. He never gets that land ready.

28:16.417 --> 28:20.459
And when winter comes,
then he signs.

28:22.251 --> 28:27.876
"Dear captain. Have fun with that
build a colony on the heath without men.

28:28.042 --> 28:33.126
Here's a little gift,
that can create a little joy in everyday life.

28:33.292 --> 28:36.126
Frederik de Schinkel."

28:44.042 --> 28:47.417
It can be decorated outside by the hens.

28:56.834 --> 29:00.667
I know where we can get men.

29:26.501 --> 29:28.584
So! Come here!

29:28.751 --> 29:31.417
Let me go, dammit!

29:36.126 --> 29:40.501
- What's your name, thief?
- Anmai Mus, for found.

29:40.667 --> 29:43.209
- How old are you?
- To.

29:43.376 --> 29:46.917
- No you are not.
- So I'm 35.

29:47.084 --> 29:49.584
I don't know, damn it.

29:49.751 --> 29:54.876
Where are the taters you travel
around with? Where have they camped?

29:59.292 --> 30:01.834
Do you remember this one?

30:02.792 --> 30:07.709
Tomorrow morning you show me
Where they are. Are you following?

30:07.876 --> 30:12.542
- They kill me.
- That's not my problem.

30:18.209 --> 30:22.667
Poor little Anmai Mouse.
She only had a short and hard life.

30:22.834 --> 30:28.959
She had not eaten for 11 days,
and hunger drove her to theft.

30:29.126 --> 30:34.584
Her mother and father would not have
her and sold her to the lawless.

30:34.751 --> 30:38.001
Stop. I don't want to listen to it.

30:40.667 --> 30:42.751
(whistle)

31:12.084 --> 31:14.042
No! No!

31:14.251 --> 31:17.376
No, no, no, let me go!

31:19.751 --> 31:23.667
Inept blackout.
You will get your punishment later.

31:25.876 --> 31:28.626
What do you want here, bings?

31:29.667 --> 31:32.792
I have work for you all.

31:32.959 --> 31:36.792
10 rigsdalers for going into the field
until autumn.

31:36.959 --> 31:39.917
You have no mark.

31:40.084 --> 31:42.084
Today.

31:42.251 --> 31:44.709
Today!

31:44.876 --> 31:49.792
A good soldier knows well that the law
forbids our kind to work.

31:49.959 --> 31:54.959
- You can go to jail for that.
- Do we have a deal?

32:07.542 --> 32:11.834
20 Riksdalers.
And I want that one too.

32:13.001 --> 32:17.667
Your medal. I've always
wanted to be a general.

32:17.834 --> 32:22.709
You can't get that. And I am
not general. I'm the captain.

32:40.917 --> 32:44.084
Salute General Hector!

32:52.667 --> 32:56.542
Do you remember when we met the Devil?
out here on the heath?

32:56.709 --> 32:59.709
In the guise of a young boy.
We were excited!

32:59.876 --> 33:04.917
Now he's the one who spanks,
for now the general is here!

33:05.084 --> 33:08.417
Now the general is here!

33:08.584 --> 33:11.667
Now working
the general and the devil...

33:11.834 --> 33:15.376
Be sure to keep the fire going
under control.

33:51.626 --> 33:55.584
- Hey! A penny for a night?
- No, no... so.

34:37.542 --> 34:40.542
Take the stick, bings.

34:49.751 --> 34:51.958
(latter)

34:52.126 --> 34:56.208
When you have taken the wand,
are you part of her clan.

34:56.376 --> 35:01.459
You can get her for five reigsdaler.
Then we get rid of that blackout.

35:03.209 --> 35:06.709
We are not in the same clan. Are you following?

35:19.584 --> 35:23.167
Freshly shot game for the harvest festival.
I shot two.

35:23.334 --> 35:28.751
You all get to taste.
You must all live well.

35:30.167 --> 35:33.417
But first of all,
then I must live.

35:33.584 --> 35:38.834
- Have you seen the animals? I shot two.
- Unfortunately, I have worrying news.

35:39.001 --> 35:43.292
Kahlen has hired a group of taters
to work for themselves.

35:43.459 --> 35:47.292
But Preisler has also discovered
something else.

35:54.084 --> 35:59.959
Three wagon loads as close to the shore as you can
find it. And it must be whitler.

36:03.167 --> 36:05.876
It must be whiting.

36:11.501 --> 36:16.751
- Sir. de Schinkel was happy with it.
- Then he can put it on himself.

36:16.917 --> 36:22.084
Mine should be more simple.
Honorable, but still feminine.

36:22.251 --> 36:26.501
They mean something
a military man would appreciate?

36:48.209 --> 36:51.959
You should hold on
far away from Schinkel.

36:52.959 --> 36:56.876
- Everyone, who is something, is coming tonight.
- Everyone, is there anything?

36:57.042 --> 37:01.501
Businessmen.
Folks, I'm going to trade with.

37:01.667 --> 37:05.542
Apparently it's not the only one
reason you go there.

37:05.709 --> 37:11.501
Don't meddle with mine
personal matters. You are a housekeeper.

37:11.667 --> 37:16.834
Then it's as good as it gets.
The nice people must accept you as you are.

37:17.001 --> 37:21.209
But you must remember
to hide that stitching in the crease.

37:46.251 --> 37:50.917
Thank God you're here.
I could hardly recognize you.

37:51.126 --> 37:53.584
Ludvig Kahlen.

37:53.751 --> 37:57.376
- Captain. Heat conditions.
- De Schinkel.

37:57.542 --> 38:02.376
Glad you came. But you can
don't be here with the lousy wig.

38:02.542 --> 38:06.209
I can't offer it
to my other guests.

38:06.376 --> 38:11.251
- There are no lice in my wig.
- I can see it is tingling and crawling.

38:11.417 --> 38:15.417
Lise has brought a wig,
that you can borrow.

38:16.584 --> 38:19.001
Com. Immediately.

38:23.167 --> 38:25.042
And...

38:31.667 --> 38:35.459
Like that. Then you are as good as new.

38:35.626 --> 38:37.709
Enjoy the party.

38:42.917 --> 38:46.876
Follow me, sir.
The lady is waiting for you.

38:56.959 --> 39:00.376
- Miss Edel.
- Captivating

39:06.751 --> 39:10.084
It was a gift from your cousin.

39:11.251 --> 39:14.001
He is a spoiled child.

39:14.167 --> 39:17.709
Trying desperately
to impress his father's friends.

39:17.876 --> 39:21.626
He drinks from morning to night
and boasts -

39:21.792 --> 39:25.292
- all the female tyents,
he has ridden to.

39:25.459 --> 39:30.751
It's like he thinks I'll find
the amusing or attractive.

39:33.251 --> 39:35.417
I have to go.

39:36.501 --> 39:38.917
I have to get out of here.

39:42.126 --> 39:46.542
- What does your father say?
- He only thinks about the money.

39:46.709 --> 39:49.959
He has forbidden me to go home.

39:50.126 --> 39:55.667
I will stay here over the winter
and try to see the good in Frederik.

39:55.834 --> 39:59.542
He wants us married within a year.

39:59.709 --> 40:05.292
Unless I can introduce him
for a better alternative.

40:09.834 --> 40:12.417
Can I do that?

40:17.417 --> 40:21.959
A man who gets the king's high
wish to come true, -

40:22.126 --> 40:25.667
- with that title and reward,
that comes with it.

40:25.834 --> 40:30.959
He might become worthy of
to marry you.

40:32.167 --> 40:35.376
If that's what you're asking.

40:38.751 --> 40:42.042
Otherwise I thought I was obvious.

40:43.542 --> 40:48.876
They haven't had many incoming calls
conversations with women. Have you?

40:49.042 --> 40:53.667
This is the longest conversation,
I have had. Correct.

40:55.792 --> 41:00.126
And you will succeed
to build your colony out there?

41:00.292 --> 41:02.501
And.

41:14.542 --> 41:16.626
(chorus)

41:45.001 --> 41:49.209
I apologize for the interruption,
but there is a surprise, -

41:49.376 --> 41:53.584
- and I can't wait any longer.
It is something quite special.

42:11.501 --> 42:15.001
This farmer ran away in the spring.

42:15.167 --> 42:19.876
I treated him and his wife
with respect, even with love.

42:20.042 --> 42:23.626
As I treat all my people.

42:25.959 --> 42:29.501
And he thanked me by
to run his way.

42:32.626 --> 42:36.709
He hid with Ludvig Kahlen
out on the heath, -

42:36.876 --> 42:40.376
- But enough about that.
It's a long story.

42:43.917 --> 42:46.001
(chorus)

42:53.167 --> 42:56.834
If you interfere
and legal bondeafstraffelse, -

42:57.001 --> 43:00.542
- you yourself are considered
who breaks the law.

43:00.709 --> 43:05.626
Do not worry. The water is not
not nearly as hot as it looks.

43:17.751 --> 43:20.126
(John screams)

43:48.501 --> 43:51.584
One more time for the beautiful girls.

43:53.542 --> 43:55.917
(John screams)

44:02.417 --> 44:05.667
One more time for the beautiful girls.

44:07.292 --> 44:09.876
(John complains)

44:20.417 --> 44:23.542
It's a good idea to stop now.

44:23.709 --> 44:26.584
The people are not with you.

44:35.501 --> 44:39.042
No. Do it one more time
for the beautiful girls.

44:39.209 --> 44:42.084
Frederick! Now that's enough.

44:42.251 --> 44:47.251
Do it one more time now!
Then do it for the beautiful girls!

45:03.126 --> 45:06.167
You killed him.

45:06.334 --> 45:10.834
I have every right to
to punish my own serfs.

45:11.001 --> 45:15.917
No one could know he would perish.
What do you say, Bondo?

45:17.209 --> 45:21.626
Yes, that's right.
It was an accident.

45:21.792 --> 45:26.417
So, the farmer must have been
delicately designed or...

45:26.584 --> 45:29.709
Let him be. He is mine.

45:29.876 --> 45:33.876
Not anymore.
According to the law, he belongs to God now.

45:34.792 --> 45:36.542
So take him.

45:50.876 --> 45:55.417
Ludwig. I know,
that you use taters as labor.

45:55.584 --> 46:00.667
You must not house illegal taters.
You are ordered to send them away.

46:03.334 --> 46:06.876
Aren't the outlaws gone?
tomorrow morning, -

46:07.042 --> 46:10.751
- then we remove them by force...
and you too.

46:10.917 --> 46:16.834
I'll see through that,
if you sign our contract.

47:25.292 --> 47:27.834
I am sorry.

48:08.917 --> 48:12.584
You didn't hit me like a man
who was afraid of something.

48:12.751 --> 48:16.917
We had a deal.
Otherwise I can't get the ground ready.

48:17.084 --> 48:22.292
There is no reason for you to travel.
You can work at night.

48:24.126 --> 48:28.751
Are you an idiot?
There is a boiled man in your field.

48:28.917 --> 48:33.667
We sure as hell don't want to die
for your heating project.

48:55.876 --> 48:58.501
What do we do?

48:59.876 --> 49:03.667
You won't make it through the winter
without money or men.

49:03.834 --> 49:08.001
I don't need men.
I can do it myself.

49:08.167 --> 49:13.584
- The land will be cultivated in the spring.
- And what about Schinkel?

49:44.584 --> 49:48.626
Schinkel takes trips
between the maids.

49:48.792 --> 49:53.292
He always has one or two guards with him,
so you don't run away.

49:56.959 --> 50:01.876
When Johannes and I got married,
he became enraged.

50:02.042 --> 50:05.167
And now he has killed him.

50:08.126 --> 50:11.959
Schinkel doesn't stop,
before he has won.

50:14.459 --> 50:17.834
Where do you intend to go?

50:19.626 --> 50:24.626
- As far away as I can get.
- I would like to ask you to stay.

50:26.459 --> 50:30.417
I can't both cultivate the fields
and keep the house.

50:30.584 --> 50:34.459
- I need you.
- Keep the house?

50:35.459 --> 50:40.292
My husband is dead and you are afraid
if the floor is not swept, -

50:40.459 --> 50:44.126
- or if everything is perfect,
as usual!

50:49.042 --> 50:52.167
- I can pay you.
- With what?

50:52.334 --> 50:55.959
- You have no more money.
- When the king hears...

50:56.126 --> 51:00.209
Stop talking about the king.
You've never met him.

51:00.376 --> 51:05.459
You'll never get to that.
He doesn't even know you exist.

51:54.501 --> 51:57.084
What is Schinkel afraid of?

51:57.251 --> 52:01.251
what happens to him
if colonies come out here?

52:01.417 --> 52:06.459
Then he loses his power.
He becomes an insignificant little man.

52:08.959 --> 52:13.667
I have to do three men's work,
so I have to have double rent.

52:13.834 --> 52:16.459
And a fifth of the harvest.

52:20.167 --> 52:22.542
A tenth.

52:27.834 --> 52:31.584
And I want to know
what you intend to grow.

52:43.584 --> 52:47.042
- What is it?
- Potatoes.

52:47.209 --> 52:51.334
They grow them in Germany and France.
They are sailing creatures.

52:51.501 --> 52:55.792
They can withstand almost anything.
They just must not get frost.

53:03.292 --> 53:06.959
My mother was a kitchen maid. On an estate.

53:07.126 --> 53:13.084
She was in the same situation as you.
With her master.

53:14.376 --> 53:17.167
You are the son of a landowner?

53:17.334 --> 53:21.042
He was my father, yes.
But I was not his son.

53:24.792 --> 53:26.876
(clink)

53:33.334 --> 53:36.001
Damned shit bowl!

53:45.501 --> 53:48.376
What are you doing here?

53:48.542 --> 53:53.001
I've run away from those stupid pigs.

53:53.167 --> 53:55.751
I don't want to be sold.

54:00.626 --> 54:02.876
Come on.

54:03.042 --> 54:07.251
You have to find the others again.
You can't be here.

54:14.542 --> 54:20.209
I can't take care of a child.
We don't even have food for ourselves.

55:15.667 --> 55:18.542
Damned thief, damned thief.

55:18.709 --> 55:25.084
You have stolen my knife, and tomorrow
at seven you lose your life.

55:26.709 --> 55:30.751
A fool! Take it, dear father.

55:35.834 --> 55:39.667
- It eats children, you idiot.
- No, it does not.

55:39.834 --> 55:44.834
It is much more afraid of you,
than you are for it. Came.

55:47.251 --> 55:51.042
Kitchen, look! I'm holding a fool!

55:51.209 --> 55:54.667
I don't understand your tater words,
Anmai Go.

55:54.834 --> 55:58.376
Madrum... It comes from Latin.

55:58.542 --> 56:01.626
It is a RotvÃ¦l word for mother.

56:01.792 --> 56:06.751
Madrum, Gud-bings and bette papa.

56:12.876 --> 56:16.417
Yes that's fine. Then we work.

56:23.667 --> 56:25.959
(thunder)

56:27.001 --> 56:31.209
But the miller took little Carl Andersen
and threw him into the lake.

56:31.376 --> 56:35.209
And then everyone knew
that the miller drowned children every night.

56:35.376 --> 56:40.417
- Why does no one do anything about the pig?
- It's coming. Want to hear more?

56:40.584 --> 56:45.376
- Yes, damn it. What a pig!
- You have to stop that banter.

56:45.542 --> 56:50.292
Why didn't he just fly in
to the children if he could fly?

56:50.459 --> 56:53.417
The miller himself had four children.

57:14.667 --> 57:17.584
(Anmai Mus hoster)

57:17.751 --> 57:21.751
You should drink it.
Your lungs must rest.

57:39.251 --> 57:42.751
Her body can't fight back.
She needs food.

57:42.917 --> 57:48.417
- Porridge and water are not enough.
- That's what we have.

57:48.584 --> 57:52.834
- We have the potatoes.
- We don't touch them.

57:53.001 --> 57:57.667
We have one goat left. We must
survive on the milk all winter.

57:57.834 --> 58:02.084
- There are 20 sacks of potatoes...
- We don't touch them!

58:11.042 --> 58:15.917
Edel's father says she's babbling about
Ludvig Kahlen in his letters home.

58:16.084 --> 58:18.376
Does she care about him?

58:18.542 --> 58:22.126
She is a realist.
She would never choose a moor farmer -

58:22.292 --> 58:27.792
- rather than the most wealthy
man in the area. Never.

58:28.876 --> 58:31.834
No, she wouldn't.

58:35.126 --> 58:40.834
She's smarter than that.
So what does she know that we don't?

58:43.626 --> 58:47.876
So, he got a shipment
all the way from Germany.

58:48.042 --> 58:52.001
- Maybe it's potatoes.
- Potatoes?

58:54.876 --> 58:58.917
If you don't say
that they can grow in almost any type of soil?

59:19.834 --> 59:22.959
Anmai Mouse, go in and rest.

59:30.667 --> 59:32.876
(bell rings)

59:54.126 --> 59:56.751
Merry Christmas, Ludvig.

59:59.042 --> 01:00:02.959
- You hoped it was Edel.
- What are you doing here, Schinkel?

01:00:03.126 --> 01:00:07.126
De Schinkel, Ludvig. The Schinkel.

01:00:10.334 --> 01:00:15.709
Are you still here? You just come
home when you get tired of the heat.

01:00:15.876 --> 01:00:19.584
You will always be
my little Ann Barbara.

01:00:23.126 --> 01:00:26.626
I actually came in good faith.

01:00:29.751 --> 01:00:33.251
Leftovers from Christmas dinner.
There is both pork and cake.

01:00:33.417 --> 01:00:38.001
You probably have to gnaw a little
to get the meat off the bones.

01:00:42.959 --> 01:00:46.334
Get into the heat.
I have good news.

01:00:50.709 --> 01:00:53.751
I have not been fair.

01:00:53.917 --> 01:00:58.251
You come out here on the heath
with your big dream.

01:00:58.417 --> 01:01:03.834
Then I just sit up there on the property
and spoils it all for you.

01:01:11.959 --> 01:01:15.667
- Aren't you curious?
- It's money.

01:01:15.834 --> 01:01:19.251
Yes please. It is 2000 Riksdalers.

01:01:22.126 --> 01:01:27.167
That's enough to build two colonies.
Hire as many men as you want.

01:01:27.334 --> 01:01:31.292
- You can live like a king.
- I will not work for you.

01:01:31.501 --> 01:01:37.667
You don't have to work for anyone. Just
go somewhere else and cultivate the heath.

01:01:37.834 --> 01:01:43.459
As long as it's far away, the two of us
will be free to stare at each other.

01:01:47.542 --> 01:01:51.084
Start over somewhere else.

01:01:51.251 --> 01:01:54.251
Then the wallet is yours.

01:02:03.417 --> 01:02:06.334
Then we have an agreement.

01:02:06.501 --> 01:02:10.459
I want to go home
to my warm fireplace.

01:02:15.417 --> 01:02:20.042
One more thing. Of course you must
report to the Interest Chamber, -

01:02:20.209 --> 01:02:24.459
- that this is my land
and always has been.

01:04:07.751 --> 01:04:09.584
Ludwig.

01:04:11.292 --> 01:04:12.959
Ludwig.

01:04:13.126 --> 01:04:17.959
That goat is worth a hundred times more
than a fucking sack of potatoes.

01:04:18.126 --> 01:04:22.167
What if the harvest fails?
Ludvig, won't you... Ludvig!

01:04:55.751 --> 01:04:58.876
I know it's Mysling.

01:04:59.042 --> 01:05:02.959
I can't anymore
hear her out there.

01:05:07.251 --> 01:05:13.167
Tell the story again. What happens,
when the colonists come, bette papa?

01:05:15.876 --> 01:05:20.084
When the colonists come,
then we can cultivate the whole moor, -

01:05:20.251 --> 01:05:23.001
- and then comes the king
and visit us.

01:05:23.167 --> 01:05:25.251
Overbingsen.

01:05:28.459 --> 01:05:33.001
Yes. Then comes the overbing
and visit us.

01:05:35.001 --> 01:05:40.834
And then there are fireplaces
in all rooms, we get closed windows...

01:05:41.876 --> 01:05:45.376
And you get all the food you can eat.

01:05:47.167 --> 01:05:50.792
And we get animals out in the barn.

01:05:50.959 --> 01:05:54.917
As many animals,
which Noah had on his ark.

01:06:12.626 --> 01:06:14.709
(door opens)

01:06:20.459 --> 01:06:24.292
I have given my blanket
to Anmai Mus.

01:06:25.584 --> 01:06:28.459
I just need the heat.

01:07:08.209 --> 01:07:12.959
I know your heart belongs
another. Mine does too.

01:07:44.167 --> 01:07:47.084
Are there more Mussels?

01:08:04.542 --> 01:08:08.626
- When are they coming up?
- In two or three months.

01:08:08.792 --> 01:08:12.751
And then there will be many more of them.
Hundreds of sacks.

01:08:12.917 --> 01:08:16.751
- Damn it, hundreds?
- One more.

01:09:42.917 --> 01:09:44.626
Frost!

01:09:57.792 --> 01:10:02.376
Carpets are not enough.
Take the heather! Take the heather!

01:10:24.917 --> 01:10:27.334
(thunder)

01:10:33.834 --> 01:10:35.917
(screams)

01:11:20.001 --> 01:11:23.042
Bette far, and rydling!

01:11:23.209 --> 01:11:26.417
Bette far, and rydling!

01:11:26.584 --> 01:11:29.667
A clearing, come on!

01:11:41.542 --> 01:11:44.792
And rider, bette far!

01:11:56.959 --> 01:12:00.501
And it was you
there found it, Anmai Mouse.

01:12:01.417 --> 01:12:04.751
And you were the one who found it.

01:12:27.251 --> 01:12:30.917
"Cultivated on the heath. L. Kahlen."

01:12:33.209 --> 01:12:37.834
Are you aware of what that means?
It has taken five decades.

01:12:38.001 --> 01:12:41.959
you behave
as if he invented the wheel.

01:12:42.126 --> 01:12:47.584
- It took a whole year to grow one sack.
- 80 sacks according to this.

01:12:48.542 --> 01:12:51.542
- His Majesty the King.
- Your Majesty.

01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:56.167
We have received a shipment of potatoes
from the Jutland heath.

01:12:56.334 --> 01:13:00.626
- It is correct...
- It is a big day for Denmark.

01:13:00.792 --> 01:13:06.792
Get some colonists out there and worry
to send an appropriate reward.

01:13:17.626 --> 01:13:18.876
What?

01:13:20.459 --> 01:13:25.042
Miss, the captain has succeeded
to grow potatoes on the heath.

01:13:25.209 --> 01:13:28.376
- Where did you hear that?
- Bondos kammerpige.

01:13:28.542 --> 01:13:34.126
They made him a royal surveyor.
50 colonists come from Germany.

01:13:55.251 --> 01:13:59.584
I never doubted. Never.
Neither has God.

01:13:59.751 --> 01:14:03.167
Speaking of Our Lord,
then I leave you for a time.

01:14:03.334 --> 01:14:08.251
- Tomorrow I go to Odense.
- You have your head in a bucket there.

01:14:08.417 --> 01:14:13.459
And to Copenhagen to collect money
into the first church on the moor.

01:14:13.626 --> 01:14:16.334
Cheers! Pancakes!

01:14:16.501 --> 01:14:18.917
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

01:14:52.959 --> 01:14:55.126
Lavmos...

01:14:56.376 --> 01:15:01.751
... peat is often stingy...

01:15:01.917 --> 01:15:06.417
Nutritious.
Stingy, that's something else entirely.

01:15:06.584 --> 01:15:09.417
- Nutritious.
- Louis.

01:15:22.667 --> 01:15:25.209
Are you Ludvig Kahlen?

01:15:33.167 --> 01:15:35.792
Welcome to Kongenshus.

01:15:35.959 --> 01:15:40.459
You who stand here today,
will go down in history -

01:15:40.626 --> 01:15:45.792
- as the king's first colonists
on the Danish heath.

01:15:45.959 --> 01:15:49.334
The building materials for your houses
on the way.

01:15:49.501 --> 01:15:55.417
You can camp in the valley sheltered from
the wind and recover from the journey.

01:15:55.584 --> 01:16:00.292
- We have bread and meat for everyone.
- What is she doing here?

01:16:02.959 --> 01:16:07.917
She works here. She helps
with the animals and the surveying.

01:16:11.626 --> 01:16:14.917
- Anmai Go, order.
- No!

01:16:17.876 --> 01:16:23.417
Her kind bring death and misfortune.
If we're going to stay, she's got to go.

01:16:36.126 --> 01:16:41.876
I make sure she doesn't come near
wives and children. She stays at the house.

01:16:45.917 --> 01:16:49.126
You won't see her again.

01:16:53.251 --> 01:16:57.709
Let time pass and they will discover
that you are not at all dangerous.

01:16:57.876 --> 01:17:00.709
It's like I stink of stench.

01:17:00.876 --> 01:17:03.792
It is not you,
there is something wrong with.

01:17:03.959 --> 01:17:07.459
They are afraid of you,
although they should know better.

01:17:07.626 --> 01:17:11.126
Just like you once
was afraid of small beetles.

01:17:17.917 --> 01:17:21.376
I think you said
that you don't stink.

01:17:22.876 --> 01:17:26.542
Stop teasing.
You're bad at it.

01:17:26.709 --> 01:17:29.834
There's someone in here
that reeks of stench.

01:17:30.001 --> 01:17:35.126
- You stink of horse piss!
- What did you say?

01:17:35.292 --> 01:17:39.334
I have never heard...
That's the worst thing I've heard!

01:17:42.751 --> 01:17:46.709
Two steps to the right. There!

01:17:46.876 --> 01:17:50.501
And then you write 220
in this column.

01:17:50.667 --> 01:17:54.501
A total, total and a circle.

01:17:55.709 --> 01:18:00.959
Doesn't the wig guy get angry about,
that we are so close to his castle?

01:18:01.126 --> 01:18:04.751
Maybe, but he decides
no longer here.

01:18:23.167 --> 01:18:29.417
Dear Frederik. You can easily
remain an important piece out here, -

01:18:29.584 --> 01:18:32.751
- even though colonists have arrived.

01:18:34.084 --> 01:18:38.792
But... Ludvig Kahlen
is royal surveyor now.

01:18:39.792 --> 01:18:43.376
If you fight him,
then you risk everything.

01:18:44.917 --> 01:18:48.501
You have to
to make peace with him.

01:18:52.876 --> 01:18:56.876
Then say you want to get married
with me right now.

01:18:57.042 --> 01:19:03.167
What is holding you back? You say,
that I become an important piece.

01:19:03.376 --> 01:19:05.876
So say yes.

01:19:09.001 --> 01:19:11.417
Say yes.

01:19:15.876 --> 01:19:19.834
Do not you think,
that I know about your plan, what?

01:19:20.001 --> 01:19:25.084
You probably already spread
your legs for him.

01:19:25.251 --> 01:19:28.417
Let go of me. Let go of me. Let go of me!

01:19:38.084 --> 01:19:41.584
Came. Hit me again.

01:19:42.626 --> 01:19:45.042
Hit me again.

01:19:45.876 --> 01:19:47.959
(roars)

01:19:52.417 --> 01:19:55.417
- Mister...
- What are you doing?

01:19:56.959 --> 01:20:00.376
What is it?

01:20:00.542 --> 01:20:02.709
No no!

01:20:02.876 --> 01:20:06.292
Stop! Stop, stop!

01:20:09.084 --> 01:20:12.042
Stop, Frederik!
(the maid screams)

01:20:16.084 --> 01:20:20.459
You are crazy.
You are crazy.

01:20:40.917 --> 01:20:46.334
Kahlen and his potato Germans
gotta get off my heat, Bondo.

01:20:48.251 --> 01:20:50.667
He has to go.

01:21:12.501 --> 01:21:17.501
This is the way.
There is plenty of food in there.

01:21:28.376 --> 01:21:30.459
(horsehair)

01:21:35.917 --> 01:21:39.584
- What happens?
- I think I dreamed something.

01:21:39.751 --> 01:21:41.834
(horsehair)

01:21:45.501 --> 01:21:46.751
Stay here.

01:21:57.334 --> 01:21:59.417
(horsehair)

01:22:15.792 --> 01:22:19.209
Calm, calm... calm.

01:22:22.209 --> 01:22:25.542
Go inside and lock the doors.

01:22:25.709 --> 01:22:27.459
And...

01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:45.209
(wolf howl and scream)

01:22:46.251 --> 01:22:48.667
(shouts and screams)

01:23:09.167 --> 01:23:14.126
- A clean cut. It wasn't the wolves.
- They must have smelled the blood.

01:23:14.292 --> 01:23:19.542
What's going on? Half of
our animals are dead. Whos behind?

01:23:20.667 --> 01:23:22.542
Peter?

01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:25.167
Peter!

01:23:26.876 --> 01:23:29.376
- Peter.
- Being!

01:23:30.501 --> 01:23:32.167
Being!

01:24:10.917 --> 01:24:13.126
What kind of horse is that?

01:24:13.292 --> 01:24:16.501
You have beaten
two innocent civilians killed.

01:24:16.667 --> 01:24:20.709
I hope you have strong evidence
for such a crazy claim.

01:24:20.876 --> 01:24:25.042
- But I'm just a national judge.
- They were under the king's protection.

01:24:25.209 --> 01:24:29.626
I think you've had visitors
by some highway robbers.

01:24:29.792 --> 01:24:32.251
They have ravaged the area.

01:24:32.417 --> 01:24:37.667
Once they have tasted blood,
then they come again, and they come again.

01:24:37.834 --> 01:24:41.251
- And they come again.
- Stay away from the heath.

01:24:41.417 --> 01:24:43.584
Is that understood?

01:24:45.501 --> 01:24:50.542
Chaos, Ludvig. You can make plans,
as crazy as you want.

01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:55.667
Life is chaos. Why is it
so hard for you to accept?

01:26:00.084 --> 01:26:02.959
Can I have a glass of water, please?

01:26:03.126 --> 01:26:07.209
You can do it.
The well is right out there.

01:26:07.376 --> 01:26:09.459
- What?
- Ann Barbara.

01:26:09.626 --> 01:26:12.751
We want to be alone.

01:26:14.251 --> 01:26:16.334
Of course.

01:26:21.501 --> 01:26:25.876
- I thought she was a housekeeper.
- So is she.

01:26:31.084 --> 01:26:32.917
They should not have come.

01:26:33.084 --> 01:26:36.584
I know,
who killed the colonists.

01:26:36.751 --> 01:26:41.876
Major Preisler and his friend RÃ¸mer came
with four men in chains.

01:26:42.042 --> 01:26:45.126
They must have taken them from the prison.

01:26:45.292 --> 01:26:48.001
- Are they still at the estate?
- No.

01:26:49.167 --> 01:26:54.126
They don't stop here.
Is there somewhere else they could be?

01:26:54.292 --> 01:26:56.959
Where can they hide?

01:26:58.792 --> 01:27:01.501
Frederik's hunting lodge.

01:27:03.084 --> 01:27:08.584
- What are you going to do?
- It's best you go back. Now.

01:27:12.834 --> 01:27:14.792
Come on.

01:27:27.501 --> 01:27:29.584
See you.

01:27:37.667 --> 01:27:42.834
I know who killed Peter
and Vera. And I know where they are.

01:27:43.001 --> 01:27:48.334
We would never have come if we knew
They were at war with a landowner.

01:27:48.501 --> 01:27:51.917
- You should have said that.
- It's the king's land.

01:27:52.084 --> 01:27:55.459
We have the law on our side.

01:27:55.626 --> 01:28:01.417
The assailants are coming back.
Do you understand? We have to stop them.

01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:05.876
Have any of you been in the army?

01:28:08.042 --> 01:28:13.834
None of us lift a finger,
before you send the devil girl away.

01:28:16.667 --> 01:28:21.501
- She has nothing to do with this.
- We don't want to listen to it, Kahlen!

01:28:23.792 --> 01:28:29.292
We said she brought misfortune.
Now two of our people are dead!

01:28:31.209 --> 01:28:35.042
Send her away or we leave.

01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:39.209
And then you can forget everything
about your colony.

01:28:46.834 --> 01:28:49.584
What are you saying?

01:28:50.501 --> 01:28:54.876
We can't just send her away.
She is our child!

01:28:55.042 --> 01:28:58.292
- Then let them travel.
- Now hold it.

01:29:02.876 --> 01:29:06.167
I have no choice.

01:29:07.334 --> 01:29:09.501
Yes, you have.

01:29:10.834 --> 01:29:14.834
But it all has to add up
Ludvig Kahlen's big plan.

01:29:15.001 --> 01:29:20.584
You just want your noble title,
so you can mingle with the nice people.

01:29:20.751 --> 01:29:24.626
What do you want me to do?

01:29:24.792 --> 01:29:27.626
I have no choice.

01:30:13.917 --> 01:30:18.667
It is a monastery in Odense,
where they take in homeless children.

01:30:18.834 --> 01:30:24.709
She gets food and a place to sleep. But
she will work for a living.

01:30:54.084 --> 01:30:57.959
You will be happy there,
where are you going.

01:30:58.126 --> 01:31:01.251
There are many other children.

01:31:04.084 --> 01:31:06.084
So...

01:31:07.334 --> 01:31:08.834
And...

01:31:25.126 --> 01:31:28.167
You are going to have a good life.

01:31:28.334 --> 01:31:33.251
You have learned to read. You know all about
how to care for animals.

01:31:38.959 --> 01:31:41.751
Now you must be strong.

01:31:41.917 --> 01:31:43.876
So... Drive.

01:31:51.834 --> 01:31:55.667
Bette far! Bette far!

01:32:09.001 --> 01:32:12.667
How long are we going to stay
in this hole?

01:32:12.834 --> 01:32:15.501
Until the work is done.

01:32:15.667 --> 01:32:19.459
12 years in a penitentiary,
and he calls this a hole?

01:32:19.626 --> 01:32:25.209
I go in and rest. We ride
in an hour. Get your weapons ready.

01:34:27.584 --> 01:34:30.917
(horse neigh and sound of horse hooves)

01:34:35.459 --> 01:34:37.834
What the hell is going on?

01:34:38.001 --> 01:34:42.292
The Germans attacked us.
I was the only one who got away.

01:34:45.959 --> 01:34:48.209
Those damn potato farmers!

01:34:48.376 --> 01:34:52.626
It was all done with
military precision. Led by Kahlen.

01:34:52.792 --> 01:34:58.167
And you're standing here drinking! You should
stay and fight, you coward!

01:34:59.417 --> 01:35:02.542
Give me new men,
then I'll fix him.

01:35:02.709 --> 01:35:07.501
- Do it! What are you waiting for?
- Did you see who killed RÃ¸mer?

01:35:08.959 --> 01:35:10.709
Kahlen.

01:35:10.876 --> 01:35:16.751
He has murdered a former officer
in cold blood, and we have a witness.

01:35:35.001 --> 01:35:40.459
The Germans have told what
has happened. And where were you last night.

01:35:42.501 --> 01:35:45.917
Did you collect money for the church?

01:35:46.959 --> 01:35:51.376
They also said,
that you have sent Anmai Mus away.

01:35:59.376 --> 01:36:03.376
- Where is Ann Barbara?
- There is a letter.

01:36:26.959 --> 01:36:31.334
If you can prove that Kahlen
killed an officer...

01:36:31.501 --> 01:36:35.459
We can.
Major Preisler saw it with his own eyes.

01:36:35.626 --> 01:36:39.376
- We would like to help you, Schinkel.
- De Schinkel.

01:36:39.542 --> 01:36:43.209
No landowner wants,
that Kahlen builds his colony.

01:36:43.376 --> 01:36:47.334
But there is one thing
that surprises us all a little.

01:36:47.501 --> 01:36:51.709
It is the distribution of income,
as you suggest.

01:36:51.876 --> 01:36:56.209
This is my land. It's only fair
that I get the majority.

01:36:56.376 --> 01:36:59.292
It's not your land, Schinkel.

01:36:59.459 --> 01:37:02.292
- You know that.
- De Schinkel.

01:37:02.459 --> 01:37:09.084
And if it goes as it should, it can
You get a tenth like the rest of us.

01:37:09.251 --> 01:37:13.084
You sit and insult me
in my own home.

01:37:14.084 --> 01:37:17.001
You can forget about it. Forget it!

01:37:26.042 --> 01:37:29.376
Sir. de Schinkel accepts
your conditions.

01:37:29.542 --> 01:37:34.459
He just needs to sleep on it.
But we have an agreement.

01:37:36.876 --> 01:37:38.959
Damn it!

01:37:39.792 --> 01:37:42.959
He has killed an officer.

01:37:44.001 --> 01:37:49.626
He succeeds in uniting Central Jutland
most powerful landowners.

01:37:49.792 --> 01:37:54.667
Men who usually hate each other
like the plague, in a common front!

01:37:54.834 --> 01:37:59.959
Against us! I'm not taking the fall
for him. I damn well don't.

01:38:00.126 --> 01:38:03.542
We agreed that Kahlen
did not have a format for the task.

01:38:03.709 --> 01:38:07.042
Perhaps we should investigate
what has happened.

01:38:07.209 --> 01:38:10.917
His Majesty was impressed,
how far Kahlen had come.

01:38:11.084 --> 01:38:15.126
His Majesty knows nothing about,
who is kahlen you idiot.

01:38:15.292 --> 01:38:17.834
After all, he's cranky around the clock.

01:38:18.001 --> 01:38:23.834
He doesn't care who
there is on the heath, as long as there is someone.

01:38:25.376 --> 01:38:29.459
If we say yes to the landowners
proposal, we sentence Kahlen to death.

01:38:29.667 --> 01:38:33.751
Without a trial,
without hearing his side of the story.

01:38:33.917 --> 01:38:36.667
You still haven't got it.

01:38:36.834 --> 01:38:41.042
When the king asks,
then nothing has changed.

01:38:41.209 --> 01:38:44.667
The colony is still being built.
Everything is going according to plan.

01:38:44.834 --> 01:38:50.251
We cannot sentence a man to death,
that never existed.

01:39:06.376 --> 01:39:08.709
(a fly flutters)

01:39:15.584 --> 01:39:17.626
(shot)

01:39:17.792 --> 01:39:20.542
(horse neigh and shout)

01:39:27.126 --> 01:39:33.376
You are staying illegally
on Frederik de Schinkel's land!

01:39:33.542 --> 01:39:39.001
You must leave the area immediately
and sign up for Hald Gods.

01:39:39.167 --> 01:39:43.876
- You have until tonight to pack.
- Preisler!

01:39:44.042 --> 01:39:48.126
Get out of here! The colony is
under the king's protection.

01:39:48.292 --> 01:39:53.209
Not anymore. The earth belongs now
Mr. de Schinkel and his partners.

01:39:53.376 --> 01:39:58.376
The deed is signed and sealed
of the King's Interest Chamber.

01:40:18.001 --> 01:40:21.501
In God's name, that's enough!

01:40:21.667 --> 01:40:26.334
- I must ask you to disappear.
- Get out of the way, Eklund. Go home.

01:40:26.501 --> 01:40:30.084
You have none
powers here, Preisler.

01:40:30.251 --> 01:40:33.376
You are hired by a private landowner.

01:40:33.542 --> 01:40:37.084
What will the authorities say to
that you are a murderer?

01:40:37.251 --> 01:40:39.084
Anton, don't.

01:40:39.251 --> 01:40:43.876
That you rode in with a bunch of criminals
and murdered innocent people.

01:40:44.042 --> 01:40:46.751
Shut up, Anton. Go home.

01:40:46.917 --> 01:40:50.917
The interest rate chamber may not think so
on a bunch of German peasants, -

01:40:51.084 --> 01:40:55.417
- but I am a man of God.
And I guaranteeâ¦

01:41:05.709 --> 01:41:07.417
Stop!

01:41:27.459 --> 01:41:31.209
De Schinkel has taken over
Royal house. Make room.

01:41:31.376 --> 01:41:37.001
They have arrested Ludvig Kahlen.
De Schinkel has taken over Kongenshus.

01:41:54.917 --> 01:41:57.376
Shut up! Let me out!

01:42:02.126 --> 01:42:07.251
Don't go out to him, miss.
It will only make it worse for him.

01:42:17.959 --> 01:42:22.167
It's crazy that it's here,
we are finished, Ludvig.

01:42:22.334 --> 01:42:25.709
It is completely unnecessary.

01:42:25.876 --> 01:42:31.167
Say it's my land
that it has always been my land, -

01:42:31.334 --> 01:42:34.751
- then I'll let you live.

01:42:34.917 --> 01:42:37.042
I promise.

01:42:41.501 --> 01:42:44.001
It is the king's land.

01:43:04.834 --> 01:43:07.126
(Kahlen complains)

01:43:25.251 --> 01:43:29.292
Tell them they can begin
to boil the water.

01:43:48.209 --> 01:43:51.834
- High school.
- Have you been hired here again?

01:43:52.001 --> 01:43:56.376
The Lord has asked for a glass
liqueur out. Will you make it happen?

01:43:56.542 --> 01:43:59.042
What are you doing here?

01:44:04.876 --> 01:44:07.209
(Kahlen screams)

01:44:13.959 --> 01:44:16.834
Let it cool down a bit.

01:44:19.209 --> 01:44:23.417
Sir, Miss Edel wishes
to see you in your chamber.

01:44:24.417 --> 01:44:27.251
Now she wants to see me
on my chamber.

01:44:27.417 --> 01:44:30.292
No thanks. I will be here.

01:44:30.459 --> 01:44:35.959
The miss wants to negotiate
the conditions of an engagement.

01:44:51.334 --> 01:44:57.042
You marry me and I spare
Kahlen's life. Is that how it is?

01:44:57.209 --> 01:44:59.084
And.

01:45:00.376 --> 01:45:03.459
That is my only condition.

01:45:05.376 --> 01:45:11.001
You are such a deceitful goose,
and one cannot trust a word, -

01:45:11.167 --> 01:45:15.792
- but if you show me right now,
that you mean what you say, -

01:45:15.959 --> 01:45:22.001
- then I promise I'll let him out,
and then the court must decide his fate.

01:45:25.376 --> 01:45:27.959
Does it show you?

01:45:28.917 --> 01:45:32.334
Now hold it.
You know what I mean.

01:45:44.001 --> 01:45:46.334
Just there on the floor?

01:45:47.459 --> 01:45:50.084
Or should we take the bed?

01:45:50.292 --> 01:45:55.209
We can do whatever you want.
We can also do both.

01:46:02.667 --> 01:46:04.376
Oh...

01:46:08.126 --> 01:46:12.292
I guess I just got it
one glass of wine too much.

01:46:12.459 --> 01:46:14.792
(Frederik coughs)

01:46:27.251 --> 01:46:28.959
Tel...

01:46:42.792 --> 01:46:45.251
Ann Barbara...

01:46:45.417 --> 01:46:47.834
You shouldn't be here.

01:46:48.001 --> 01:46:51.126
Out with you! Guard!

01:46:57.876 --> 01:47:01.626
You will be hanged for this, you sow!

01:47:06.459 --> 01:47:09.251
No, don't...

01:47:14.209 --> 01:47:16.751
It is for Johannes.

01:47:18.751 --> 01:47:20.917
(there is a knock on the door)

01:47:29.376 --> 01:47:30.792
(cry)

01:48:02.626 --> 01:48:05.126
(bell chimes and shouts)

01:48:12.792 --> 01:48:17.209
- The Lord is dead.
- Ann Barbara has killed him.

01:49:11.709 --> 01:49:14.209
Sorry, it took some time.

01:49:14.376 --> 01:49:18.501
I had to explain to the Interest Chamber,
how it all came together.

01:49:26.917 --> 01:49:29.417
The Germans have left, Ludvig.

01:49:29.584 --> 01:49:33.876
Miss Edel has gone home
to his family in Norway.

01:49:35.626 --> 01:49:39.459
You can keep the Royal Palace.
But the gods must know, -

01:49:39.626 --> 01:49:44.001
- if they ever send bids
for new colonists.

01:49:47.501 --> 01:49:49.667
Ann Barbara?

01:49:52.167 --> 01:49:55.292
We don't see her again.

01:49:57.209 --> 01:50:00.626
She sits in Aalborg for life.

01:50:00.792 --> 01:50:05.001
No visits.
No chance of getting out.

01:50:30.167 --> 01:50:34.417
Have you changed the water?
Then go in and change the water!

01:50:57.167 --> 01:51:01.001
I need
a strong worker in the house.

01:51:01.167 --> 01:51:07.209
One, who is good with animals, and who has
learned to write numbers in a surveyor's book.

01:51:07.376 --> 01:51:11.459
You do not know,
where can i find one like that right?

01:51:32.667 --> 01:51:35.751
I shouldn't have sent you away.

01:51:35.917 --> 01:51:39.959
I promise,
that I will never disappoint you again.

01:51:40.959 --> 01:51:44.709
I promise,
that I will always take care of you.

01:52:00.417 --> 01:52:04.626
- When will she come back?
- She's not coming back.

01:52:04.792 --> 01:52:07.751
She is happy where she is now.

01:52:07.917 --> 01:52:11.709
I think she lives on the beach
in a small house by the sea, -

01:52:11.876 --> 01:52:14.459
- which she has always talked about.

01:52:14.626 --> 01:52:18.584
If God-bings are in Heaven,
and the Germans have gone away, -

01:52:18.751 --> 01:52:22.376
- then there's only you and me left,
bette far.

01:52:22.542 --> 01:52:25.709
But we can also do it ourselves, the two of us. Does not?

01:53:05.959 --> 01:53:09.334
41... 18.

01:53:09.501 --> 01:53:12.167
16...

01:53:12.334 --> 01:53:17.334
I don't think it will rain.
We can let the goats out.

01:53:19.542 --> 01:53:22.376
(there is a knock on the door)

01:53:27.042 --> 01:53:31.876
Hello. Do you need to have it repaired
the windows or replaced something?

01:53:32.042 --> 01:53:35.292
No. We don't need anything.

01:53:37.667 --> 01:53:40.459
What about knives that need to be sharpened?

01:53:40.626 --> 01:53:44.626
We need five new windows,
and then we have a box of knives, -

01:53:44.792 --> 01:53:49.167
- and the barn must be closed for winter,
and then the well needs new stones.

01:53:49.334 --> 01:53:52.709
- She's a quant dill, huh?
- Stop.

01:53:56.251 --> 01:54:00.917
- And you are a qvant bings.
- You are tater?

01:54:04.001 --> 01:54:06.084
Anmai Go.

01:54:17.001 --> 01:54:19.751
Yes, further down... yes.

01:54:19.917 --> 01:54:22.917
Yes, move your fingers. Yes.

01:54:36.667 --> 01:54:41.584
Ludvig von Kahlen, we hand you over
this official decree to the effect, -

01:54:41.751 --> 01:54:46.334
- that you as agreed with the Interest Chamber
receives the title of lieutenant baron -

01:54:46.501 --> 01:54:51.709
- with land use rights
and 20 years of tax exemption.

01:54:51.876 --> 01:54:55.917
Your appanage will take effect,
when the colony is completed.

01:54:56.084 --> 01:55:01.459
- Yes, it is 2000 Riksdaler annually.
- Colonies?

01:55:01.626 --> 01:55:06.001
Yes. We send bids
after 400 colonists this spring.

01:55:07.167 --> 01:55:09.834
They'll have enough to look after.

01:55:12.584 --> 01:55:17.126
May we say congratulations,
from Kahlen?

01:55:21.084 --> 01:55:23.792
It is a huge achievement.

01:55:25.709 --> 01:55:28.126
(door opens)

01:55:29.584 --> 01:55:34.167
Then I finally got them sent off.
I've never seen two grown men -

01:55:34.334 --> 01:55:38.334
- be so engrossed
of a potato plant. Snaps!

01:55:39.376 --> 01:55:44.209
- How are the hemorrhoids?
- I don't talk about them anymore.

01:55:44.376 --> 01:55:49.126
People don't understand anyway
the pain i'm going through.

01:56:12.334 --> 01:56:17.751
You have received another rejection
to have Ann Barbara's sentence shortened.

01:56:23.667 --> 01:56:26.876
Unfortunately, I have more bad news.

01:56:27.042 --> 01:56:32.959
The female prisoners from Aalborg must
transferred to Slaveriet in Copenhagen.

01:56:33.126 --> 01:56:35.626
Ann Barbara too.

01:56:38.126 --> 01:56:43.126
You know as well as I do
what slavery means.

01:56:43.292 --> 01:56:46.667
Those poor things don't live long.

01:56:47.542 --> 01:56:51.251
I'm sorry to have to
pass it on to you.

01:57:06.459 --> 01:57:10.126
Could you bring the bottle
for the trip home?

01:57:15.959 --> 01:57:21.501
Things rarely go our way
had imagined them, Ludvig.

01:57:47.626 --> 01:57:50.042
(whistle)

01:59:26.167 --> 01:59:28.959
Thank you for everything, dear father.

02:02:16.501 --> 02:02:20.251
(horse neigh and sound of horse hooves)

02:07:01.167 --> 02:07:04.292
