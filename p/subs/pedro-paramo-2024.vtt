00:31.671 --> 00:34.630
<i>I came to Comala
because I was told my father lived here.</i>

00:35.921 --> 00:37.505
<i>One Pedro Páramo.</i>

00:39.463 --> 00:41.005
<i>That's what my mother told me.</i>

00:43.088 --> 00:44.880
<i>And I promised her I'd come,</i>

00:46.380 --> 00:49.546
<i>for she was near death,
and I of a mind to promise her anything.</i>

00:51.796 --> 00:53.338
<i>Before this she had told me,</i>

00:54.046 --> 00:55.963
<i>"Don’t ask him for anything."</i>

00:56.963 --> 00:58.921
<i>"Demand of him what's ours."</i>

01:00.005 --> 01:02.213
<i>"For the neglect he showed us, my son...</i>

01:03.171 --> 01:04.796
<i>make him pay."</i>

01:26.755 --> 01:28.713
<i>I never thought I'd keep my promise.</i>

01:29.546 --> 01:31.713
<i>Until I began to fill myself with dreams.</i>

01:33.255 --> 01:35.255
<i>To give flight to illusions...</i>

01:36.338 --> 01:40.713
<i>And I started forming a world built
around the hope that was that man...</i>

01:41.880 --> 01:43.255
<i>my mother's husband.</i>

02:10.171 --> 02:12.588
And why are you headed to Comala,
if I might ask?

02:14.505 --> 02:15.838
I'm going to see my father.

02:20.421 --> 02:22.463
He'll throw you quite the party.

02:24.255 --> 02:26.255
He'll be glad to see someone.

02:27.921 --> 02:31.255
And what's your father like?

02:32.338 --> 02:33.588
I don't know him.

02:34.880 --> 02:36.838
I just know his name is Pedro Páramo.

02:41.796 --> 02:43.088
You don't say.

02:46.880 --> 02:48.588
Do you know Pedro Páramo?

02:53.171 --> 02:54.171
Who is he?

02:56.630 --> 02:58.171
A living resentment.

03:08.463 --> 03:10.713
- It's hot here.
- Yes.

03:12.755 --> 03:14.380
This is nothing.

03:15.588 --> 03:18.963
You'll feel it worse
when we get to Comala.

03:19.796 --> 03:21.380
They say

03:22.088 --> 03:24.005
many who die there and go to hell,

03:25.296 --> 03:28.130
come back for their blankets.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.171
I'm also Pedro Páramo's son.

04:00.463 --> 04:02.046
You sure we've made it to Comala?

04:02.546 --> 04:03.838
I'm sure, <i>señor.</i>

04:06.588 --> 04:07.963
Why does it look so sad?

04:09.463 --> 04:10.963
It's the times, <i>señor.</i>

04:18.213 --> 04:19.463
It looks abandoned.

04:20.338 --> 04:23.005
It doesn't just look that way. It is.

04:24.130 --> 04:25.630
Nobody lives here.

04:27.963 --> 04:29.088
And Pedro Páramo?

04:31.505 --> 04:33.880
Pedro Páramo died many years ago.

04:50.421 --> 04:52.130
Where can I find a room?

04:53.005 --> 04:56.130
Look for Doña Eduviges
if she's still alive.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.630
Tell her I sent you.

04:59.421 --> 05:00.838
And what's your name?

05:01.796 --> 05:02.796
Abundio...

05:14.630 --> 05:17.963
<i>I bring the same eyes with which
my mother saw these things.</i>

05:19.088 --> 05:20.171
<i>She told me,</i>

05:20.838 --> 05:22.546
<i>"There you'll find my town,</i>

05:23.380 --> 05:25.046
<i>raised on the hillside,</i>

05:26.255 --> 05:27.921
<i>full of trees and leaves."</i>

05:29.755 --> 05:31.338
<i>"You'll hear me better there."</i>

05:32.505 --> 05:33.963
<i>"I'll be closer to you."</i>

05:38.046 --> 05:39.880
<i>"I would've liked to tell her,</i>

05:41.671 --> 05:43.505
<i>'You lead me astray.'"</i>

05:44.921 --> 05:46.713
<i>"You sent me to a lonesome town."</i>

05:48.421 --> 05:50.338
<i>"Searching for someone who doesn't exist."</i>

06:17.755 --> 06:18.755
Excuse me.

06:20.088 --> 06:22.046
Do you know where Doña Eduviges lives?

06:23.046 --> 06:24.046
Over there.

06:24.838 --> 06:27.463
The pink house with arches.

06:56.921 --> 06:58.505
I'm Eduviges Dyada.

07:00.421 --> 07:01.421
Come in.

07:12.296 --> 07:13.296
This way.

07:20.171 --> 07:21.255
What's all this?

07:23.088 --> 07:24.130
Just stuff.

07:25.088 --> 07:27.671
The house is full of stuff.

07:29.546 --> 07:32.505
Those who left chose it
to store their things,

07:32.505 --> 07:34.671
but nobody has returned for them.

07:39.088 --> 07:40.880
So, you're her son?

07:42.463 --> 07:43.296
Whose son?

07:45.255 --> 07:46.630
Doloritas.

07:49.338 --> 07:50.755
Yes, but how did you know?

07:51.546 --> 07:53.171
She told me you'd be coming.

07:55.963 --> 07:57.380
That you'd come today.

07:58.546 --> 07:59.463
Who? My mother?

07:59.963 --> 08:00.838
Yes.

08:01.713 --> 08:02.713
Her.

08:08.880 --> 08:10.213
This is your room.

08:13.296 --> 08:15.671
I keep it ready in case someone stops by.

08:21.130 --> 08:22.671
There’s nowhere to lie down.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.296
Don’t worry about that.

08:27.046 --> 08:29.713
Tiredness is a good mattress for fatigue.

08:31.296 --> 08:34.171
It's not easy to arrange
everything in no time.

08:35.338 --> 08:37.796
And your mother didn’t
let me know until now.

08:40.130 --> 08:41.338
My mother's dead.

08:44.338 --> 08:46.171
So that's why her voice sounded so weak.

08:47.546 --> 08:48.713
Now I understand.

08:50.380 --> 08:52.046
How long's it been since she passed?

08:53.713 --> 08:55.005
Around seven days now.

08:56.963 --> 08:58.630
She must've felt abandoned.

09:00.005 --> 09:02.130
We promised we would die together.

09:02.880 --> 09:05.213
To give each other courage
on that final journey.

09:06.713 --> 09:08.588
So, she beat me to it, huh?

09:10.963 --> 09:13.213
But you can be sure I'll catch up to her.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.880
I know how to shorten the paths.

09:17.755 --> 09:20.838
It all consists of dying when one chooses,

09:21.338 --> 09:22.838
and not when He mandates.

09:25.838 --> 09:27.546
First come have a bite to eat.

09:28.755 --> 09:30.838
- A little something.
- I'll come.

09:34.213 --> 09:35.296
I'll come later.

10:24.546 --> 10:26.838
What's taking you so long in the privy,
young man?

10:27.880 --> 10:29.005
Nothing, Mama.

10:29.671 --> 10:33.088
If you stay in there much longer,
a snake will come out and bite you.

10:35.255 --> 10:36.838
Let out more string, Susana!

10:44.630 --> 10:45.671
Good.

10:48.505 --> 10:49.630
- No, no!
- Oh no.

11:02.255 --> 11:03.838
I love this place because of you,

11:08.171 --> 11:10.255
but I hate it for everything else.

11:12.296 --> 11:14.005
Even for having been born here.

11:22.296 --> 11:23.880
I'll come visit from time to time.

11:26.796 --> 11:27.963
You're not coming back.

11:34.088 --> 11:35.213
You'll never return.

12:46.338 --> 12:48.171
I told you to come out of the privy.

12:49.296 --> 12:50.546
I'm coming, Mama.

12:51.755 --> 12:52.838
I'm coming.

12:52.838 --> 12:55.130
Your father says
we can't count on you for anything.

12:56.838 --> 12:58.338
That you're becoming useless.

13:13.421 --> 13:15.505
Shouldn't you be working?

13:16.338 --> 13:17.963
No. Rogelio doesn't pay me.

13:18.463 --> 13:22.921
You don't work at Rogelio's
to earn money. You work there to learn.

13:24.213 --> 13:26.338
For now, you have to resign yourself.

13:27.671 --> 13:29.463
Let others resign themselves, Grandma.

13:30.630 --> 13:32.296
I'm not one for following orders.

13:33.421 --> 13:35.338
You and your strange ideas!

13:36.546 --> 13:39.838
I feel that things won't go well for you,
Pedro Páramo.

13:44.338 --> 13:46.255
<i>I believed that woman was crazy.</i>

13:48.130 --> 13:49.630
<i>Later I didn't believe anything.</i>

13:51.005 --> 13:52.838
<i>I felt in a faraway place</i>

13:54.005 --> 13:55.505
<i>and let myself go.</i>

13:57.421 --> 13:58.463
Yes, it's true.

13:59.671 --> 14:02.005
I was close to being your mother.

14:05.838 --> 14:07.213
She never told you?

14:09.421 --> 14:10.880
She only told me good things.

14:19.630 --> 14:22.296
I heard about you
from the mule driver who brought me here.

14:23.630 --> 14:24.630
A man named Abundio.

14:25.838 --> 14:27.255
He's a good one, that Abundio.

14:28.255 --> 14:31.421
I used to tip him
for each traveler he'd send my way.

14:32.713 --> 14:34.130
Until he went deaf.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.880
The one I'm talking about
could hear just fine.

14:38.880 --> 14:42.046
Anyway, getting back to your mother.

14:42.921 --> 14:45.296
The thing is,
when she was to marry Pedro Páramo,

14:46.005 --> 14:49.796
they told her she could not lie
with a man that night

14:50.713 --> 14:51.963
since the moon was upon her.

14:54.921 --> 14:57.546
So she asked me to go in her place.

15:03.130 --> 15:04.505
You slept with Pedro Páramo?

15:06.505 --> 15:08.713
I got into bed with him gladly.

15:11.380 --> 15:13.713
But the day's excitement

15:13.713 --> 15:16.671
had left him worn out,
and he spent the night snoring.

15:17.171 --> 15:18.838
You were born the following year.

15:20.505 --> 15:21.630
But not to me.

15:22.130 --> 15:23.963
Although it was very close!

15:27.130 --> 15:29.546
Maybe your mother didn't tell you

15:30.755 --> 15:31.713
out of shame.

15:37.296 --> 15:38.921
I brought a portrait of her.

15:43.255 --> 15:45.505
Your mother always loathed Pedro Páramo.

15:46.880 --> 15:50.130
He would do nothing
but complain and order her about.

15:50.755 --> 15:52.755
And even though
she was no stranger to hardship,

15:54.463 --> 15:56.713
her humble eyes hardened.

15:58.421 --> 16:00.213
That's when she began to sigh.

16:01.088 --> 16:04.296
Finally, Pedro Páramo sent her away
to live with her sister.

16:07.755 --> 16:09.171
We lived with her in Colima.

16:09.671 --> 16:12.963
Some months later,
I asked Pedro Páramo about her.

16:14.838 --> 16:16.963
"How will they survive?" I would ask.

16:17.838 --> 16:20.505
And he would say,
"Let God take care of them."

16:23.588 --> 16:25.005
"Let God take care of them."

16:32.255 --> 16:33.921
When will you rest?

16:45.046 --> 16:46.130
Wake up!

17:06.130 --> 17:07.380
Why are you crying, Mama?

17:11.421 --> 17:12.671
Your father has died.

17:16.171 --> 17:17.671
They've killed your father.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.921
And you, Mother? Who killed you?

17:41.171 --> 17:43.005
<i>When will you rest?</i>

17:44.505 --> 17:46.213
Is something wrong, Doña Eduviges?

17:49.921 --> 17:51.880
It's Miguel Páramo's horse.

17:54.296 --> 17:56.963
Galloping along the road to Media Luna.

17:58.046 --> 17:59.796
So someone still lives at the Media Luna?

18:00.380 --> 18:03.380
No, no one lives there.

18:05.505 --> 18:06.588
I don't understand.

18:08.046 --> 18:10.380
- I don't hear a horse, either.
- No?

18:14.630 --> 18:17.255
Then it must be my sixth sense.

18:19.130 --> 18:20.671
A gift from God.

18:23.046 --> 18:24.921
Or perhaps a curse.

18:27.421 --> 18:28.755
Who was Miguel Páramo?

18:28.755 --> 18:30.296
Pedro Páramo's son.

18:31.630 --> 18:32.630
Another son?

18:33.796 --> 18:35.713
The only one he recognized as his own.

18:39.005 --> 18:41.630
He would spend some nights at my house.

18:42.130 --> 18:44.171
Until he met a girl from Contla.

18:45.255 --> 18:47.338
At night, he'd set off to visit her...

18:49.380 --> 18:51.671
and would return in the early dawn.

18:53.005 --> 18:54.838
But that night he didn't return.

18:57.671 --> 19:01.838
His horse was still passing by
when I felt someone knocking at my window.

19:03.755 --> 19:06.046
It might have just been my imagination.

19:15.005 --> 19:16.296
What happened?

19:17.088 --> 19:18.380
Did she break it off?

19:21.421 --> 19:22.255
That's not it.

19:23.463 --> 19:25.046
It's just that I lost the town.

19:28.046 --> 19:29.463
What are you saying, Miguel?

19:30.880 --> 19:32.255
There was a lot of fog.

19:34.005 --> 19:35.005
Or smoke.

19:35.838 --> 19:39.713
Or who knows what. What I do know,
is that Contla doesn't exist.

19:41.838 --> 19:45.421
I came to tell you
because I know you understand me.

19:46.796 --> 19:50.755
If I told anyone else in Comala,
they'd say I'm crazy.

19:53.213 --> 19:54.296
Like they always do.

19:59.755 --> 20:01.296
Not crazy, Miguel.

20:04.505 --> 20:06.005
You must be dead.

20:07.796 --> 20:11.171
Remember you were told
that horse was going to kill you one day.

20:11.963 --> 20:14.713
I only jumped over that stone fence
my father recently put up

20:14.713 --> 20:17.005
to avoid having to go
all the way around it.

20:19.088 --> 20:20.755
But there was nothing but smoke.

20:24.796 --> 20:25.796
Go.

20:32.130 --> 20:34.338
Go rest in peace, son.

20:38.838 --> 20:41.005
I'm grateful you came to say goodbye.

21:07.296 --> 21:09.005
Let us give thanks!

21:12.005 --> 21:14.171
Father, we want you to bless him!

21:15.255 --> 21:17.380
No. I won't do it.

21:19.005 --> 21:23.088
He was an evil man
and he won't enter the Kingdom of Heaven.

21:23.671 --> 21:26.338
God would be offended
if I intercede on his behalf.

22:15.130 --> 22:17.213
You know who they buried today?

22:21.046 --> 22:22.046
Yes, Uncle.

22:23.546 --> 22:25.838
You're sure it was him, right?

22:31.963 --> 22:33.130
Not completely sure, Uncle.

22:34.713 --> 22:35.838
I didn't see his face.

22:36.463 --> 22:38.380
He found me at night, and it was dark.

22:38.380 --> 22:42.338
So, how'd you know it was Miguel Páramo?

22:43.963 --> 22:45.005
Because he said so.

22:47.005 --> 22:49.796
He told me his name.
He said to not be afraid.

22:54.963 --> 22:59.630
But you knew he was responsible
for your father's death, didn't you?

23:01.130 --> 23:02.130
Yes, Uncle.

23:02.921 --> 23:06.088
So, what did you do to push him away?

23:09.796 --> 23:10.921
I didn't do anything.

23:15.463 --> 23:17.463
He said he had come to apologize...

23:18.463 --> 23:20.588
I thought about what you taught me.

23:23.255 --> 23:25.005
That we should never hate anyone.

23:28.296 --> 23:29.755
Then I felt him on top of me

23:33.046 --> 23:35.380
as he began doing bad things to me.

23:39.046 --> 23:40.630
I thought he was gonna kill me.

23:50.505 --> 23:54.046
Now he must be sinking
to the very depths of hell

23:56.088 --> 23:58.421
because that's
what I've asked all the saints for.

24:00.088 --> 24:02.463
You mustn't be too sure of that, child.

24:03.630 --> 24:06.505
Who knows how many are praying
for him right now.

24:11.671 --> 24:14.463
Besides, I've given him absolution.

24:16.838 --> 24:18.005
What are you saying, Uncle?

24:20.588 --> 24:24.255
Let's thank the Lord,
for He has taken him from this earth,

24:24.255 --> 24:26.255
where he has caused so much harm.

24:27.005 --> 24:29.463
Even if now
He has now received him in Heaven.

25:05.505 --> 25:07.380
Excuse me, Father Rentería.

25:08.338 --> 25:09.755
What do you need?

25:13.755 --> 25:15.296
My sister has died.

25:17.171 --> 25:18.463
How did it happen?

25:22.796 --> 25:24.838
She took her own life.

25:32.171 --> 25:34.213
What do you want me to do, María?

25:35.755 --> 25:38.546
I came to ask you to save her.

25:39.796 --> 25:41.671
But she killed herself.

25:43.671 --> 25:46.255
She acted in defiance of God.

25:47.755 --> 25:49.546
She failed at the last hour.

25:52.796 --> 25:56.838
So many good deeds
accumulated toward salvation,

25:57.838 --> 26:00.296
only to lose them in an instant.

26:00.296 --> 26:02.505
But she didn't lose them.

26:03.796 --> 26:06.838
She died choking on her own blood.

26:06.838 --> 26:08.546
Full of pain.

26:09.296 --> 26:10.421
And pain...

26:13.838 --> 26:17.255
You once told us something
about pain that I no longer remember.

26:18.463 --> 26:23.130
I mean, perhaps
by saying a few Gregorian Masses.

26:23.796 --> 26:26.796
But we'd need to ask for assistance,
send for priests.

26:28.505 --> 26:29.755
And that costs money.

26:30.921 --> 26:32.713
I don't have money.

26:34.171 --> 26:36.088
You know that, Father.

26:40.755 --> 26:42.546
Let's leave things as they are.

26:44.130 --> 26:45.630
Let's put our faith in God.

26:53.296 --> 26:54.296
Yes, Father.

27:39.171 --> 27:42.046
<i>...with your forgiveness</i>

27:43.463 --> 27:48.713
<i>Ave Maria</i>

27:49.921 --> 27:54.963
<i>Save her soul</i>

27:55.880 --> 28:00.713
<i>From purgatory</i>

28:01.463 --> 28:06.171
<i>With your forgiveness</i>

28:06.671 --> 28:11.630
<i>The light of the candle</i>

28:12.546 --> 28:16.880
<i>Grants eternal rest</i>

28:20.796 --> 28:23.088
Have you ever heard the moan of the dead?

28:34.505 --> 28:35.963
You'd better not, son.

28:53.338 --> 28:54.463
Doña Eduviges.

28:59.546 --> 29:00.588
Doña Eduviges?

29:05.213 --> 29:06.130
Doña Eduviges!

29:10.338 --> 29:11.588
Are you not coming back?

29:19.296 --> 29:20.630
<i>Let me go to my house!</i>

29:21.130 --> 29:24.296
<i>Let me go to say goodbye to my wife!
Let me go!</i>

29:25.171 --> 29:26.380
<i>Don Fulgor!</i>

29:29.046 --> 29:30.296
<i>No!</i>

30:00.338 --> 30:01.880
Doña Eduviges, is that you?

30:04.755 --> 30:06.088
I'm not Eduviges.

30:09.130 --> 30:10.588
My name is Damiana.

30:11.921 --> 30:13.338
I heard you were here,

30:14.421 --> 30:15.755
and I came to find you.

30:17.463 --> 30:18.796
Damiana Cisneros?

30:21.255 --> 30:23.046
Did you live in the Media Luna?

30:23.046 --> 30:26.380
That's where I live. That's why
it's taken me a while to get here.

30:27.713 --> 30:30.546
My mother told me about a Damiana
who cared for me when I was born.

30:31.880 --> 30:35.380
I've known you since you first
opened your eyes, Juan Preciado.

30:41.171 --> 30:44.088
I'll come with you.
I don't know what's happening here.

30:45.588 --> 30:47.421
Strange things are happening.

30:57.296 --> 30:58.880
I have to tell you...

31:00.380 --> 31:01.796
a few moments ago,

31:02.755 --> 31:03.880
from that very room...

31:05.338 --> 31:07.046
I heard someone wailing.

31:08.630 --> 31:10.338
As if in torment.

31:11.005 --> 31:13.838
Perhaps it's an echo trapped in there.

31:14.921 --> 31:19.630
In that room, they hanged Toribio Aldrete
a long time ago.

31:20.130 --> 31:23.088
Then they sealed the door
until his body dried out.

31:27.046 --> 31:28.713
I don't know how you got in.

31:30.046 --> 31:31.921
There's no key to open the door.

32:03.838 --> 32:07.088
No one's gonna say
you're not man enough, Don Fulgor.

32:07.880 --> 32:09.630
I know you are capable.

32:10.588 --> 32:14.213
And not on account of the authority
behind you, but on your own.

32:16.546 --> 32:20.588
But you and I are gonna use
this paper to wipe ourselves.

32:21.421 --> 32:23.505
Since that's all it's good for.

32:25.130 --> 32:29.505
And now that I know what this is about,
I can't help but laugh.

32:31.796 --> 32:34.630
Allegedly, "Toribio Aldrete

32:34.630 --> 32:38.796
has not adjusted
to the limits of his property,

32:39.296 --> 32:43.338
and placed the dividing barriers

32:43.338 --> 32:45.921
on the land of the Media Luna,

32:46.505 --> 32:49.505
property of Don Pedro Páramo."

32:55.421 --> 32:58.671
Doesn't it make you laugh too, Don Fulgor?

33:16.630 --> 33:18.463
Alleged "usufruct."

33:20.463 --> 33:23.380
"Usufruct," you say.

33:25.088 --> 33:29.088
Your <i>patrón</i> should be ashamed
for being so ignorant.

33:31.588 --> 33:32.630
Say, Viges...

33:34.505 --> 33:36.463
Can I use the room upstairs?

33:36.463 --> 33:38.088
Anything you need, Don Fulgor.

33:39.171 --> 33:40.921
Are your men going to stay the night?

33:43.588 --> 33:44.755
Just one of them.

33:47.880 --> 33:50.213
Don't worry about us and go to bed.

33:51.671 --> 33:53.130
Just leave us the key.

34:23.505 --> 34:24.630
Sit down, Fulgor.

34:24.630 --> 34:26.421
We can talk at ease.

34:28.505 --> 34:29.505
Why don't you sit?

34:30.171 --> 34:31.505
I'd prefer to stand, Pedro.

34:31.505 --> 34:34.713
Whatever you want.
But don't forget the "Don."

34:35.630 --> 34:37.463
- How's that going?
- What?

34:38.421 --> 34:39.921
You know what, the Media Luna.

34:40.630 --> 34:41.713
Not well.

34:42.505 --> 34:43.630
There is nothing left.

34:44.171 --> 34:45.963
We've sold the last of the livestock.

34:46.463 --> 34:50.630
Look. I won't get into details
because you don't even know the place.

34:50.630 --> 34:53.088
I mean, I've never seen you there.

34:53.088 --> 34:55.088
To date, we owe...

34:55.088 --> 34:56.255
Who do we owe?

34:56.880 --> 34:58.671
I don't care how much.
Just to whom we owe.

34:59.213 --> 35:02.671
Well, our greatest debt
is to the Preciado sisters.

35:03.546 --> 35:06.338
And then with the Fregoso,
and the Guzmán families.

35:07.421 --> 35:10.255
There's nothing left to pay them.
That's the issue.

35:10.255 --> 35:11.255
And why's that?

35:11.255 --> 35:14.421
Well, because your family used it all up.

35:15.713 --> 35:18.130
They took and took,
without giving anything back.

35:18.130 --> 35:21.130
I used to say to your late mother,
may God rest her soul,

35:22.088 --> 35:24.880
"You're gonna bleed this place dry."

35:24.880 --> 35:26.421
And that's what happened.

35:28.255 --> 35:32.005
Although someone may be interested
in buying the land, and they'd pay well.

35:34.338 --> 35:36.880
- Would that be you?
- How could you believe that?

35:36.880 --> 35:38.755
I'd believe anything, Fulgor.

35:42.796 --> 35:43.713
Okay.

35:44.213 --> 35:46.671
Tomorrow we'll start
putting our affairs in order.

35:47.338 --> 35:48.963
Beginning with the Preciado sisters.

35:49.463 --> 35:51.838
- You say that we owe them more?
- Yep.

35:52.463 --> 35:55.796
I understand one of them
went to live in the city. To Colima.

35:56.838 --> 36:02.338
And Lola, I mean, Doña Dolores, became
the sole owner of the Enmedio ranch.

36:02.338 --> 36:04.088
She's the one we'll have to pay.

36:08.588 --> 36:10.963
Tomorrow you'll ask Lola
for her hand in marriage.

36:10.963 --> 36:13.796
How do you think she'd want me?
I'm an old man.

36:13.796 --> 36:16.130
No, you'll ask her for me!

36:17.255 --> 36:19.088
After all, she has a certain charm.

36:20.588 --> 36:24.005
Tell her I'm very much in love with her.
Do that first thing tomorrow.

36:24.505 --> 36:25.463
Yep.

36:25.463 --> 36:27.755
Ask Father Rentería
to make the arrangements.

36:27.755 --> 36:29.213
How much money do you have?

36:29.213 --> 36:30.421
None, Don Pedro.

36:30.421 --> 36:33.171
Promise it to him.
Tell him we'll pay him when we can.

36:35.671 --> 36:36.921
Don't you want to sit down?

36:37.421 --> 36:38.880
I'll have a seat, Don Pedro.

36:38.880 --> 36:41.380
Truth is,
I'm beginning to like working with you.

36:42.713 --> 36:44.546
Tell Lola I love her.

36:44.546 --> 36:46.380
- That's important.
- Yeah.

36:46.380 --> 36:48.713
Truly, Sedano, I love her.

36:48.713 --> 36:50.755
For her eyes, you know?

36:51.880 --> 36:54.296
For her eyes, of course!

36:56.213 --> 36:58.546
Forgive me for blushing, Don Fulgor.

37:00.880 --> 37:05.421
But I never thought Don Pedro
would notice me.

37:06.296 --> 37:08.880
He can't sleep, thinking of you.

37:08.880 --> 37:10.838
But he could choose anyone.

37:11.755 --> 37:13.838
There are so many pretty girls in Comala.

37:15.796 --> 37:17.671
What will they say when they find out?

37:18.505 --> 37:20.380
He's a reserved man.

37:21.088 --> 37:26.255
Don Lucas Páramo, may he rest in peace,
told him you weren't worthy of him.

37:27.755 --> 37:30.171
And he kept quiet out of pure obedience.

37:31.421 --> 37:33.296
Now that his parents are gone,

37:34.171 --> 37:37.046
there's nothing to stand in the way.

37:37.671 --> 37:40.338
Let's set the wedding
for the day after tomorrow.

37:40.338 --> 37:41.505
What do you think?

37:42.588 --> 37:43.796
Isn't that rather soon?

37:50.921 --> 37:52.505
I don't have anything prepared.

37:53.171 --> 37:56.671
I’ll need to arrange for the wedding
garments and write to my sister.

38:02.005 --> 38:05.380
No. I won't be ready before April 8th.

38:05.380 --> 38:07.088
Ask him to wait just a few days.

38:08.213 --> 38:10.546
He'd prefer to do it right now.

38:11.796 --> 38:15.380
Don't worry about the bridal goods,
we'll take care of it.

38:15.963 --> 38:20.296
Don Pedro's deceased mother
expects you to wear her dress.

38:21.171 --> 38:23.296
It's a family tradition.

38:25.296 --> 38:27.630
But there's something else
about that date.

38:28.380 --> 38:30.171
Women's issues, you know?

38:31.796 --> 38:34.171
I'm mortified
to say it out loud, Don Fulgor.

38:36.171 --> 38:37.171
It's my lunar cycle.

38:37.963 --> 38:39.088
I'm so embarrassed.

38:40.171 --> 38:41.463
And so what?

38:41.463 --> 38:45.213
Marriage isn't about whether
it's your time of the month or not.

38:46.046 --> 38:47.421
It's about loving each other.

38:47.921 --> 38:49.755
I don't think you're understanding me.

38:49.755 --> 38:53.463
I understand. The wedding
will be the day after tomorrow.

38:58.671 --> 39:02.380
Don't forget to tell the judge
that the property will be owned jointly.

39:04.130 --> 39:05.546
Jointly.

39:06.255 --> 39:07.213
Yes, Don Fulgor.

39:07.713 --> 39:08.755
Excuse me.

39:23.963 --> 39:25.546
Put water on to heat, Damiana.

39:26.046 --> 39:27.088
Yes, ma'am.

39:31.213 --> 39:34.796
I'll get this started as quickly
as possible. Maybe as early as tonight.

39:38.505 --> 39:41.130
Even so,
it's gonna last my usual three days.

39:43.630 --> 39:46.338
Thank you.
Thank you, God, for giving me Don Pedro.

39:49.546 --> 39:51.255
Even if later he despises me.

40:06.213 --> 40:09.171
So, Don Fulgor,
will the Media Luna be sold?

40:09.171 --> 40:10.963
Should we find another job?

40:12.046 --> 40:16.005
You don't know what work is.
But you'll learn. Don't worry.

40:17.421 --> 40:20.171
Don Fulgor, are you not leaving then?

40:21.255 --> 40:23.338
Didn't you say that Pedro was a lazy bum?

40:23.338 --> 40:26.171
That's what my <i>patrón,</i>
Don Lucas used to say.

40:26.171 --> 40:29.463
"That he would not take care of him
even in his old age," he said.

40:30.463 --> 40:32.546
My son turned out bad.

40:34.338 --> 40:36.463
From now on,
you will all call him "Don Pedro."

40:38.046 --> 40:40.713
She's been asked and more than willing.

40:41.838 --> 40:44.963
The priest wants 60 pesos
to overlook the marriage bans.

40:44.963 --> 40:47.255
I told him he'd be paid in due time.

40:47.880 --> 40:49.796
Didn't you ask Dolores for an advance?

40:50.296 --> 40:51.338
No, <i>patrón.</i>

40:51.963 --> 40:54.130
Truth is, I didn't dare.

40:54.630 --> 40:56.046
Fulgor, you're such a child.

40:57.088 --> 40:59.088
I didn't want to dampen her spirits.

41:00.963 --> 41:03.880
Next week, you'll go see Aldrete.

41:04.588 --> 41:07.963
Tell him to redo the fence.
He's on land that belongs to Media Luna.

41:08.546 --> 41:11.630
His measurements are accurate.
I'm sure of it.

41:11.630 --> 41:14.463
Well, tell him he made a mistake.
That he's figured wrong.

41:14.463 --> 41:16.380
Tear down the fencing if need be.

41:16.880 --> 41:17.963
And the laws?

41:18.463 --> 41:19.671
What laws, Fulgor?

41:20.171 --> 41:22.796
From now on,
we'll be the ones making the laws.

41:22.796 --> 41:27.505
File a complaint accusing him of usufruct.

41:28.505 --> 41:32.130
Remind him Lucas Páramo is dead.
He'll need to deal with me now.

41:32.130 --> 41:34.963
- Yes, <i>patrón.</i> Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

41:35.713 --> 41:37.421
"Usufruct"...

41:50.255 --> 41:53.963
No one can undermine
your manhood, Don Fulgor.

41:54.838 --> 41:59.546
But I'll be damned with that
son of a bitch of a <i>patrón</i> of yours!

42:04.005 --> 42:05.755
What are you going to do?

42:05.755 --> 42:07.380
Take you to rest, <i>patrón.</i>

42:07.380 --> 42:11.255
The day has not yet come
when tequila keeps me from walking.

42:16.088 --> 42:17.171
Go ahead, Toribio.

42:18.046 --> 42:19.213
"Usufruct."

42:27.713 --> 42:32.463
Don Fulgor, no offense,
but I prefer to sleep at home.

42:32.463 --> 42:34.546
For my wife's sake, so she won't worry.

42:35.088 --> 42:36.588
I don't want to trouble you.

42:36.588 --> 42:38.505
It's no trouble at all, Don Toribio.

42:39.921 --> 42:41.088
Let's go.

42:47.880 --> 42:49.630
What are you going to do?

42:51.213 --> 42:53.588
Let me go! Let me go home!

42:54.088 --> 42:56.505
Let me go to say goodbye to my wife!

42:56.505 --> 42:57.713
Let me go!

43:00.880 --> 43:02.255
Have mercy, Don Fulgor!

43:04.380 --> 43:05.421
Don Fulgor!

43:19.296 --> 43:22.213
Don Rubén, I'm glad you came.

43:22.213 --> 43:23.755
Cheers, Don Pedro.

43:23.755 --> 43:25.255
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

43:31.296 --> 43:33.255
How are you guys doing?

43:33.921 --> 43:35.088
Excuse me.

43:37.255 --> 43:38.088
Gentlemen.

43:40.796 --> 43:41.963
Cheers, Don Pedro.

43:43.421 --> 43:46.505
The boys and I would like
to congratulate you.

43:46.505 --> 43:47.963
Thank you, Fulgor.

43:47.963 --> 43:49.046
Gentlemen.

43:52.588 --> 43:54.963
Is the thing with Toribio Aldrete
taken care of?

43:54.963 --> 43:56.796
That's settled, <i>patrón.</i>

43:57.796 --> 44:01.130
That leaves the Fregosos
and another issue we'll deal with later.

44:01.130 --> 44:02.463
What issue, Don Pedro?

44:02.463 --> 44:04.630
To find who killed my father.

44:06.380 --> 44:09.588
But save that for later.
Right now, I'm busy with my honeymoon.

44:11.421 --> 44:12.755
Let's go then, boys.

44:13.505 --> 44:15.213
- Excuse us, <i>patrón.</i>
- Sure, Fulgor.

44:19.088 --> 44:20.338
Run!

44:25.755 --> 44:27.296
Congratulations.

44:28.213 --> 44:29.421
- Counselor.
- Congratulations.

44:30.630 --> 44:32.213
Shall I take your dish, Father?

44:56.880 --> 44:57.963
Dorotea.

44:59.130 --> 44:59.963
Take this.

45:02.713 --> 45:05.213
God will repay you, Damiana.

45:05.713 --> 45:07.671
When you're done, go out the back.

45:10.630 --> 45:11.671
Excuse me.

45:16.921 --> 45:17.921
What?

45:18.921 --> 45:21.005
I'll be right back. What's going on?

45:21.546 --> 45:25.796
- What?
- He's drunk. He won't notice.

45:27.463 --> 45:29.463
What are you saying, Lola?

45:30.463 --> 45:32.380
How do you think it won't be noticed?

45:33.046 --> 45:35.171
I'm older than you and less dark-skinned.

45:35.171 --> 45:37.005
You can't see that in the dark.

45:38.588 --> 45:39.755
It can't be.

45:40.755 --> 45:42.463
Dolores, you must go.

45:42.463 --> 45:44.171
I didn't finish my menses.

45:45.796 --> 45:48.296
Do me that favor. I'll pay you back.

45:50.671 --> 45:51.880
Take my place.

45:53.046 --> 45:55.171
- That's what we're friends for, right?
- No!

46:11.671 --> 46:13.630
This town is full of echoes.

46:17.380 --> 46:22.755
There was a time when I could hear
the commotion of a party.

46:24.005 --> 46:26.171
The noise made it all the way out
to the Media Luna.

46:27.880 --> 46:30.130
I came down to see
what the fuss was about,

46:31.338 --> 46:34.005
and I saw this,
what we're seeing right now.

46:34.546 --> 46:36.796
The streets as empty as they are now.

46:37.880 --> 46:39.421
But I don't get scared anymore.

46:39.421 --> 46:43.213
I think the day will come
when these echoes will die out.

46:45.880 --> 46:49.421
If they are echoes,
they must come from a voice.

46:50.963 --> 46:52.005
You will hear them.

46:52.505 --> 46:55.796
As if they were coming out
of some crack or under the stones.

47:01.213 --> 47:03.463
This was the Páramos' house.

47:04.046 --> 47:07.130
Since his grandparents came to Comala.

47:13.005 --> 47:17.546
Although, Don Pedro lived
most of his life in the Media Luna,

47:18.755 --> 47:19.921
and I with him.

47:22.921 --> 47:25.880
I became the boss of all his maids.

47:25.880 --> 47:28.088
Just because I knew how to be respected.

47:28.921 --> 47:31.880
I was the only one
who didn't allow him into my bed.

47:37.380 --> 47:38.838
Are you going to the Media Luna?

47:40.380 --> 47:42.213
You'll have somewhere to rest there.

47:46.880 --> 47:51.213
You can't imagine the crowd of souls
that roam these streets.

47:52.255 --> 47:54.838
They are the souls
of those who died unforgiven

47:54.838 --> 47:56.380
and still suffer.

47:57.171 --> 47:59.380
Especially the ones
Pedro Páramo had killed

47:59.380 --> 48:01.213
after his father's murder.

48:02.880 --> 48:03.921
Were there that many?

48:03.921 --> 48:04.880
Yes.

48:11.296 --> 48:13.213
Did my mother also tell you I was coming?

48:16.755 --> 48:19.505
By the way, how is your mother?

48:20.171 --> 48:21.088
She died.

48:22.630 --> 48:24.088
I thought you would've known.

48:26.796 --> 48:28.296
How would I have known?

48:30.963 --> 48:33.088
It's been years since I've known anything.

48:34.088 --> 48:35.796
Then how did you find me?

48:39.963 --> 48:41.255
Are you alive, Damiana?

48:48.463 --> 48:49.421
Damiana?

48:51.546 --> 48:52.796
Damiana Cisneros!

48:54.838 --> 48:56.046
Damiana!

49:18.213 --> 49:19.505
Here, Damiana.

49:32.005 --> 49:33.713
Why are you sighing, Doloritas?

49:34.380 --> 49:38.005
I wish I were a vulture
so I could fly to where my sister lives.

49:38.921 --> 49:41.255
Of course, Doña Doloritas.

49:41.755 --> 49:43.671
You'll leave immediately
to go see your sister.

49:44.546 --> 49:45.546
Let's head back.

49:46.338 --> 49:47.671
Get her bags packed.

49:48.463 --> 49:49.796
It's the least I could do.

49:57.796 --> 50:00.296
<i>My mother lived longing for Comala.</i>

50:01.713 --> 50:02.921
<i>For the return</i>

50:04.171 --> 50:06.671
<i>to the place
where you'd want to live for eternity.</i>

50:08.630 --> 50:10.380
Isn't that Filoteo Aréchiga?

50:11.588 --> 50:13.505
That's him. Pretend not to notice.

50:15.046 --> 50:16.505
Do you think he's following us?

50:17.005 --> 50:18.380
He better not be.

50:18.380 --> 50:21.296
Rumor has it he's the one
who finds girls for Don Pedro.

50:21.880 --> 50:22.963
- Is that so?
- Go in there.

50:22.963 --> 50:24.046
Excuse me.

50:28.255 --> 50:29.255
Excuse me!

50:41.380 --> 50:43.505
I was just passing by.

50:48.088 --> 50:50.338
Don Pedro had no intention of killing me.

50:51.171 --> 50:54.713
He just wanted to know if I was at
the wedding where his father was killed.

50:56.463 --> 50:58.838
He's been getting rid of
all the guests to the party.

51:01.921 --> 51:03.671
But he just wanted to scare me!

51:14.046 --> 51:15.546
Heaven is vast.

51:44.255 --> 51:45.338
What're you doing here?

51:46.171 --> 51:47.380
Are you not dead?

51:50.213 --> 51:51.380
He's drunk.

51:53.463 --> 51:54.963
He's just scared.

51:55.671 --> 51:56.838
Come in.

52:23.005 --> 52:24.088
Are you sick?

52:25.171 --> 52:27.296
I just want to go back
to where I came from.

52:27.796 --> 52:29.463
You'd better wait until tomorrow.

52:31.671 --> 52:33.713
All roads are tangled with brush.

52:35.005 --> 52:36.005
You could get lost.

52:37.671 --> 52:39.296
Tomorrow, I'll get you on track.

53:07.921 --> 53:08.963
Who could he be?

53:11.963 --> 53:13.380
How did he get here?

53:16.213 --> 53:17.546
He must be lost.

53:20.421 --> 53:22.130
Why don't you go to sleep...

53:24.130 --> 53:25.671
and let me rest?

53:33.671 --> 53:34.671
Look at him.

53:39.588 --> 53:41.338
Look how he squirms...

53:44.046 --> 53:45.671
as if he were cursed.

53:56.546 --> 53:59.463
He must be someone who owes many deaths.

54:14.046 --> 54:15.421
It's orange blossom water.

54:16.880 --> 54:17.921
It will calm your fears.

54:23.588 --> 54:24.921
No need to worry about me.

54:31.130 --> 54:32.505
How can I get out of here?

54:32.505 --> 54:33.588
To go where?

54:34.630 --> 54:35.838
Anywhere.

54:38.088 --> 54:39.796
There's a multitude of roads.

54:45.213 --> 54:46.630
Where did your husband go?

54:49.546 --> 54:50.630
He's not my husband.

54:52.255 --> 54:53.088
He's my brother.

55:00.255 --> 55:01.755
He doesn't want to believe it.

55:06.380 --> 55:08.588
But don't you think I'm scary?

55:11.213 --> 55:12.296
Come closer.

55:15.130 --> 55:16.296
Look at my face.

55:22.005 --> 55:23.505
What is it you want me to see?

55:27.796 --> 55:29.213
Don't you see the sin on me?

55:34.963 --> 55:37.046
Don't you see the rash?

55:41.380 --> 55:42.963
And that's just on the outside.

55:47.963 --> 55:50.005
Inside, I'm an ocean of mud.

55:53.796 --> 55:54.838
If you don't mind...

55:57.755 --> 55:59.296
I'd like to get some sleep.

56:47.296 --> 56:48.380
He's not coming back.

56:50.755 --> 56:51.796
I beg your pardon?

56:51.796 --> 56:53.546
I could see it in his eyes.

56:56.505 --> 56:59.255
He was just waiting for someone
to show up so he could leave.

57:02.338 --> 57:04.338
Now you'll have to look after me.

57:06.088 --> 57:07.088
Or what?

57:09.255 --> 57:10.671
Don't you want to take care of me?

57:26.713 --> 57:28.255
Come sleep next to me.

57:29.505 --> 57:30.546
I'm fine where I am.

57:32.130 --> 57:34.005
You'd be better here on the bed.

57:34.838 --> 57:36.838
The ticks will eat you alive down there.

59:50.671 --> 59:52.921
<i>Pedro Páramo laid waste to everything.</i>

59:53.671 --> 59:56.755
<i>That's unforgivable.
And what about the rapes?</i>

59:57.421 --> 59:59.421
<i>We were also afraid of him.</i>

01:00:00.755 --> 01:00:04.421
<i>We have to wait until he dies.
You won't get anything from here.</i>

01:00:18.171 --> 01:00:21.046
<i>Pray for us, Juan Preciado.</i>

01:00:21.713 --> 01:00:24.171
<i>Pray for me, Juan Preciado.</i>

01:00:55.505 --> 01:00:59.171
<i>You expect me to believe you died
of suffocation, Juan Preciado?</i>

01:01:00.421 --> 01:01:02.880
<i>I found you twisted up.</i>

01:01:03.380 --> 01:01:06.130
<i>Like someone who's died of fright.</i>

01:01:09.088 --> 01:01:10.380
<i>It's true, Dorotea.</i>

01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:13.088
<i>It was the murmurs that killed me.</i>

01:01:14.088 --> 01:01:15.630
<i>The fear came late,</i>

01:01:16.463 --> 01:01:18.380
<i>and that's when my soul froze.</i>

01:01:21.338 --> 01:01:22.421
<i>You hear?</i>

01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:25.588
<i>It's raining up there.</i>

01:01:26.546 --> 01:01:29.171
<i>Don't you feel the rain beating down?</i>

01:01:31.046 --> 01:01:33.588
<i>It feels as if someone's walking
on top of us.</i>

01:01:34.713 --> 01:01:37.171
<i>Try to think pleasant thoughts</i>

01:01:37.171 --> 01:01:40.588
<i>because we're going to be buried here
for a long time.</i>

01:01:49.130 --> 01:01:50.755
Fall, sweet rain, fall.

01:01:51.380 --> 01:01:53.588
Keep coming till you're exhausted.

01:02:23.005 --> 01:02:25.463
Where are you coming from
this time of day, boy?

01:02:26.213 --> 01:02:27.338
I was out milking.

01:02:28.171 --> 01:02:29.130
Milking who?

01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:30.921
Can't you guess?

01:02:30.921 --> 01:02:34.755
It must be Dorotea, La Cuarraca.

01:02:34.755 --> 01:02:38.921
- She's the only one who likes babies.
- You're an idiot, Fulgor.

01:02:41.671 --> 01:02:42.755
Margarita.

01:02:44.046 --> 01:02:45.838
Where have you been, Miguel?

01:02:46.713 --> 01:02:49.880
Out and about, visiting mothers.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:51.880
Listen.

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.380
Do you know someone named Dorotea?
One they call "La Cuarraca?"

01:02:56.546 --> 01:02:58.713
If you want to see her,
she's right outside.

01:03:00.505 --> 01:03:03.255
She rises early to come here
for some breakfast.

01:03:03.255 --> 01:03:05.963
She's a poor woman who lives on handouts.

01:03:06.463 --> 01:03:08.296
Damned old man.

01:03:09.088 --> 01:03:10.171
Dorotea!

01:03:11.630 --> 01:03:13.630
Come here. I've got a deal for you.

01:03:20.088 --> 01:03:22.005
Bring on those eggs.

01:03:24.088 --> 01:03:27.005
From now on, you'll feed
that woman the same thing as me.

01:03:27.838 --> 01:03:29.880
Don't be stingy.

01:03:40.296 --> 01:03:41.546
Fulgor!

01:03:46.046 --> 01:03:48.171
- Excuse me, <i>patrón.</i>
- How are we doing?

01:03:49.130 --> 01:03:52.421
We drove the cattle from Enmedio Ranch
past what used to be the Fregosos'.

01:03:52.921 --> 01:03:55.713
And the Fregosos',
we ran them to the hills of Vilmayo.

01:03:55.713 --> 01:03:56.755
Okay.

01:03:58.588 --> 01:04:00.005
What's wrong with you?

01:04:01.671 --> 01:04:05.255
Someone came by this morning,
accusing your son Miguel of killing a man.

01:04:08.130 --> 01:04:09.671
Pretend it was me.

01:04:09.671 --> 01:04:12.255
Anything he does, put the blame on me.

01:04:13.755 --> 01:04:16.380
Miguel's gonna cause you
a lot of headaches, <i>patrón.</i>

01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:17.796
He likes trouble.

01:04:17.796 --> 01:04:20.963
Give him space. He's just a child.

01:04:21.630 --> 01:04:22.671
How old is he now?

01:04:23.171 --> 01:04:25.588
He must be 17. Right, Fulgor?

01:04:25.588 --> 01:04:26.671
Could be.

01:04:27.588 --> 01:04:29.963
But he's so violent and always in a hurry.

01:04:30.463 --> 01:04:33.838
Sometimes it feels like
he's racing against time.

01:04:35.130 --> 01:04:37.380
He'll end up losing. You'll see.

01:04:38.588 --> 01:04:40.005
He's still a baby, Fulgor.

01:04:40.588 --> 01:04:42.213
Whatever you say, <i>patrón.</i>

01:04:43.130 --> 01:04:46.755
But the woman who came claiming
that your son killed her husband

01:04:46.755 --> 01:04:48.630
was beyond hysterical.

01:04:49.796 --> 01:04:50.838
Who was it?

01:04:52.088 --> 01:04:53.380
People I don't know.

01:04:53.963 --> 01:04:57.380
Don't worry about it, Fulgor.
Those people don't exist.

01:04:58.921 --> 01:05:01.171
Keep calm. Let's do nothing.

01:05:02.255 --> 01:05:03.588
All right.

01:05:03.588 --> 01:05:04.713
Excuse me, <i>patrón.</i>

01:05:09.421 --> 01:05:12.796
<i>My mother used to tell me
about the green plains and the clouds.</i>

01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:16.880
<i>And yet, she was unable
to return to die here.</i>

01:05:19.005 --> 01:05:21.505
<i>Even for that, she sent me in her stead.</i>

01:05:23.588 --> 01:05:24.963
<i>It's strange, Dorotea.</i>

01:05:26.963 --> 01:05:28.963
<i>How I never even got to see the sky.</i>

01:05:30.755 --> 01:05:33.046
<i>I lost all interest in Heaven</i>

01:05:33.046 --> 01:05:37.380
<i>when Father Rentería assured me
I'd never know God's glory</i>

01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:41.088
<i>on account of my sins.</i>

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:44.463
<i>But he shouldn't have told me that.</i>

01:05:45.963 --> 01:05:48.671
<i>When they slam a door in your face,</i>

01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:52.296
<i>and the only one left open
takes you to hell...</i>

01:05:53.255 --> 01:05:55.171
<i>it would be better to not have been born.</i>

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:26.005
I'm told Doña Susana
and her father left Mascota.

01:06:26.005 --> 01:06:27.213
Where did they go?

01:06:27.213 --> 01:06:31.838
I've gone all over the range asking.
Some say this way, others say that way.

01:06:32.338 --> 01:06:33.880
I can't find them, Don Pedro.

01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:36.171
Spare no expense. Keep looking!

01:06:36.171 --> 01:06:39.088
- The earth couldn't have swallowed them!
- Whatever you say, Don Pedro.

01:07:58.505 --> 01:08:01.796
Not like that!
Turn him, and take him in headfirst.

01:08:23.046 --> 01:08:24.046
What did they do to him?

01:08:26.088 --> 01:08:27.380
No one did anything to him.

01:08:28.963 --> 01:08:30.338
He found death all by himself.

01:08:30.838 --> 01:08:32.463
His horse killed him, Don Pedro.

01:08:35.005 --> 01:08:36.546
I'm beginning to pay.

01:08:39.796 --> 01:08:42.296
Better start early, to finish sooner.

01:08:46.755 --> 01:08:50.005
When you can,
put that animal out of its misery.

01:08:50.005 --> 01:08:51.338
Indeed, Don Pedro.

01:09:09.505 --> 01:09:12.921
Don Pedro,
Father Rentería would like to see you.

01:09:13.421 --> 01:09:14.546
Now?

01:09:17.005 --> 01:09:18.213
Tell him to come in.

01:09:20.338 --> 01:09:21.921
Father, come in.

01:09:25.546 --> 01:09:27.005
Sorry to interrupt.

01:09:30.171 --> 01:09:34.671
Don Pedro, I was told that his mother
died giving birth and that he's yours.

01:09:35.171 --> 01:09:36.296
Here he is.

01:09:40.380 --> 01:09:41.838
Why don't you keep him, Father?

01:09:42.838 --> 01:09:43.838
Make him a priest.

01:09:45.088 --> 01:09:48.796
Not with the blood inside him.
I don't want that responsibility.

01:09:52.088 --> 01:09:53.796
You think I have bad blood?

01:09:56.463 --> 01:09:58.505
I really do, Don Pedro.

01:10:00.213 --> 01:10:01.880
I'll prove you wrong.

01:10:02.546 --> 01:10:05.421
Leave him here. There are plenty
of people who'll take care of him.

01:10:05.421 --> 01:10:06.588
That's what I figured.

01:10:06.588 --> 01:10:09.421
At least with you,
he won't lack sustenance.

01:10:10.671 --> 01:10:11.796
Damiana!

01:10:19.296 --> 01:10:20.713
Come take care of this thing.

01:10:21.213 --> 01:10:22.213
It's my son.

01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:33.005
Here's to the late mother and to you.

01:10:33.505 --> 01:10:34.546
And to the infant?

01:10:35.505 --> 01:10:37.380
To him as well. Why not?

01:10:39.463 --> 01:10:40.421
Here.

01:11:15.255 --> 01:11:17.380
Eternal rest grant unto him, O Lord,

01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:19.755
and let perpetual light shine upon him.

01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:28.963
Have mercy on Thy servant, O Lord.

01:11:28.963 --> 01:11:31.880
May he rest in peace. Amen.

01:11:45.505 --> 01:11:47.421
I know you hated him, Father.

01:11:48.755 --> 01:11:50.463
And rightly so.

01:11:50.963 --> 01:11:52.713
Your brother's murder.

01:11:54.046 --> 01:11:55.796
The case of your niece, Ana.

01:11:56.338 --> 01:11:57.796
But forget all that now.

01:11:58.755 --> 01:12:02.255
Think it over and forgive him,
as perhaps God has forgiven him.

01:12:07.463 --> 01:12:09.796
Accept this as a donation to your church.

01:12:29.255 --> 01:12:31.421
Thou wilt know if this is the price.

01:12:33.755 --> 01:12:35.880
For my part, Lord, condemn him.

01:12:42.255 --> 01:12:43.380
O Mary.

01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:44.880
Conceived without sin.

01:12:45.755 --> 01:12:47.213
Tell me your sins, my child.

01:12:47.213 --> 01:12:50.546
I confess, Father, that last night
I slept with Pedro Páramo.

01:12:50.546 --> 01:12:51.713
What else?

01:12:51.713 --> 01:12:53.755
I'm going to have Pedro Páramo's child.

01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:56.671
I gave my daughter to Pedro Páramo.

01:12:56.671 --> 01:12:59.463
May the evil you have done serve for...

01:12:59.463 --> 01:13:00.755
Serve to elevate...

01:13:00.755 --> 01:13:02.630
Merciful Father.

01:13:09.463 --> 01:13:11.130
Hail purest Mary.

01:13:12.546 --> 01:13:14.963
Conceived without sin.

01:13:15.671 --> 01:13:17.838
So now you're getting drunk?

01:13:20.255 --> 01:13:25.546
Now that I can't cause him any harm...

01:13:27.505 --> 01:13:28.671
I can say

01:13:29.505 --> 01:13:33.796
I was the one who got all those girls

01:13:34.296 --> 01:13:37.463
for the late Miguelito Páramo.

01:13:39.130 --> 01:13:40.546
You took them to him?

01:13:41.838 --> 01:13:43.171
Sometimes I did.

01:13:44.338 --> 01:13:46.796
Other times, I'd just set it up.

01:13:47.338 --> 01:13:52.963
Or I told him when they'd be all alone
so he could take them by surprise.

01:14:02.005 --> 01:14:03.005
Father...

01:14:08.838 --> 01:14:12.213
Father, aren't you going to give me
any penance?

01:14:16.130 --> 01:14:18.630
What would you have me do
with you, Dorotea?

01:14:21.463 --> 01:14:25.088
Be your own judge.
See if you can forgive yourself.

01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.421
I can't, Father.

01:14:30.588 --> 01:14:32.005
But you can.

01:14:32.505 --> 01:14:34.338
How many times have you come here

01:14:34.338 --> 01:14:37.505
asking me to send you
to Heaven when you die?

01:14:38.755 --> 01:14:42.505
You were hoping
to find your son there, right, Dorotea?

01:14:44.338 --> 01:14:45.338
Well,

01:14:46.713 --> 01:14:49.255
you won't be going to Heaven anymore.

01:14:51.046 --> 01:14:53.005
But may God forgive you.

01:14:58.088 --> 01:15:00.130
<i>Her eyelashes were already still.</i>

01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:02.213
<i>And her heart was still as well.</i>

01:15:02.213 --> 01:15:04.588
<i>Was that you saying all that, Dorotea?</i>

01:15:05.213 --> 01:15:06.796
<i>Are they still frightening you?</i>

01:15:06.796 --> 01:15:09.421
<i>There is nothing but a dead thing here.</i>

01:15:09.921 --> 01:15:11.505
<i>I heard someone speaking.</i>

01:15:12.088 --> 01:15:13.421
<i>A woman's voice.</i>

01:15:13.421 --> 01:15:14.963
<i>I thought it was you.</i>

01:15:15.463 --> 01:15:17.546
<i>It must be the woman who talks to herself.</i>

01:15:18.046 --> 01:15:19.921
<i>The one in the large grave.</i>

01:15:19.921 --> 01:15:21.505
<i>Doña Susanita.</i>

01:15:22.588 --> 01:15:24.755
<i>She's buried here beside us.</i>

01:15:25.421 --> 01:15:27.630
<i>What happens with old corpses</i>

01:15:27.630 --> 01:15:32.296
<i>is that when moisture reaches them,
they begin to stir.</i>

01:15:32.296 --> 01:15:33.546
<i>And they wake up.</i>

01:15:34.296 --> 01:15:35.380
<i>And who is she?</i>

01:15:36.963 --> 01:15:39.880
<i>Pedro Páramo's last wife.</i>

01:15:40.796 --> 01:15:42.838
<i>They say she was insane.</i>

01:15:44.755 --> 01:15:46.005
<i>What is she saying?</i>

01:15:47.588 --> 01:15:48.588
<i>She just complains.</i>

01:15:50.921 --> 01:15:52.255
<i>Maybe he made her suffer.</i>

01:15:54.963 --> 01:15:56.255
<i>Don't believe that.</i>

01:15:56.921 --> 01:15:58.005
<i>He loved her.</i>

01:15:59.213 --> 01:16:03.380
<i>I'm about to say that he loved her
more than any other woman.</i>

01:16:22.255 --> 01:16:23.505
No. You lost.

01:17:06.838 --> 01:17:09.713
<i>Now I remember
her mother died of consumption.</i>

01:17:12.046 --> 01:17:15.255
<i>It was then that she
and her father disappeared.</i>

01:17:19.755 --> 01:17:23.796
<i>When they brought her
to Pedro Páramo, many years later,</i>

01:17:23.796 --> 01:17:26.005
<i>she was suffering.</i>

01:17:28.755 --> 01:17:30.046
<i>His love was such</i>

01:17:30.046 --> 01:17:33.880
<i>that he spent his remaining years
slumped over in an old chair,</i>

01:17:34.963 --> 01:17:38.713
<i>gazing down the road
where she was taken to the cemetery.</i>

01:17:42.921 --> 01:17:44.088
It won't take long.

01:17:47.296 --> 01:17:48.171
It won't take long.

01:17:54.588 --> 01:17:55.588
Excuse me.

01:18:00.796 --> 01:18:03.005
Here are the figures
you asked for, Don Pedro.

01:18:04.255 --> 01:18:05.338
Oh goodness.

01:18:09.671 --> 01:18:10.880
Do you know who's back?

01:18:11.505 --> 01:18:12.963
Bartolomé San Juan.

01:18:15.588 --> 01:18:16.505
How come?

01:18:16.505 --> 01:18:18.463
That's what I want to know.

01:18:19.630 --> 01:18:21.838
He went straight
to that old house of yours,

01:18:21.838 --> 01:18:24.088
as if you'd already rented
the place to him.

01:18:25.088 --> 01:18:26.796
At least, that's how he acted.

01:18:27.796 --> 01:18:29.880
I'll clear things up tomorrow, Don Pedro.

01:18:31.255 --> 01:18:32.421
Did they both come?

01:18:32.421 --> 01:18:33.338
Yep.

01:18:33.838 --> 01:18:34.921
He and his wife.

01:18:35.421 --> 01:18:36.671
How did you know?

01:18:36.671 --> 01:18:38.005
Wouldn't it be his daughter?

01:18:40.505 --> 01:18:44.838
Well... considering the way he treats her,
she seems like she's his wife.

01:18:52.838 --> 01:18:53.880
It's Susana.

01:18:55.005 --> 01:18:56.171
For sure, Fulgor.

01:18:58.713 --> 01:19:02.171
We found them
near the abandoned La Andrómeda mines.

01:19:08.046 --> 01:19:11.505
What must have brought them here
are the rumors of people up in arms.

01:19:12.005 --> 01:19:13.130
Oh, maybe.

01:19:13.796 --> 01:19:16.005
They say it's getting quite serious.

01:19:16.921 --> 01:19:19.671
He must've wanted to bring her
to a place that's alive.

01:19:21.588 --> 01:19:22.630
Go to bed, Fulgor.

01:19:23.921 --> 01:19:25.671
With your permission, <i>patrón.</i>

01:19:33.713 --> 01:19:36.046
This town tastes of misfortune.

01:19:37.796 --> 01:19:40.296
We'll find no salvation here.

01:19:41.588 --> 01:19:42.713
I can feel it.

01:19:46.546 --> 01:19:50.046
I had imagined that all
he was giving us would not be free.

01:19:52.463 --> 01:19:54.588
You know what Pedro Páramo asked me?

01:19:58.546 --> 01:20:00.505
He said that all he wants from me

01:20:01.255 --> 01:20:02.505
is you.

01:20:03.713 --> 01:20:05.713
That you've been my best work.

01:20:07.171 --> 01:20:10.005
He says you played together as kids.

01:20:10.838 --> 01:20:13.171
That you even swam together in the river.

01:20:14.796 --> 01:20:17.838
Had I known,
I would've whipped you to death.

01:20:20.171 --> 01:20:21.213
I don't doubt it.

01:20:24.963 --> 01:20:27.796
So, you are willing to sleep with him?

01:20:28.630 --> 01:20:30.713
- Yes, Bartolomé.
- Don't call me Bartolomé.

01:20:32.588 --> 01:20:33.755
I'm your father!

01:20:37.546 --> 01:20:39.005
I've told him you're a widow.

01:20:40.213 --> 01:20:42.380
And you still live with your husband.

01:20:44.421 --> 01:20:47.421
Or at least that's how you act.

01:20:51.755 --> 01:20:53.546
I've tried to dissuade him.

01:20:54.421 --> 01:20:57.171
But he scowls when I talk to him.

01:20:59.421 --> 01:21:00.796
He's pure evil.

01:21:01.755 --> 01:21:03.171
That's what Pedro Páramo is.

01:21:07.838 --> 01:21:09.130
And who am I?

01:21:10.338 --> 01:21:11.421
You're my daughter.

01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:13.338
Mine.

01:21:14.546 --> 01:21:16.505
The daughter of Bartolomé San Juan.

01:21:23.921 --> 01:21:25.255
What have we done?

01:21:27.296 --> 01:21:29.380
Why has our soul rotted away?

01:21:32.421 --> 01:21:33.546
It is not true.

01:21:35.546 --> 01:21:37.838
- It is not true.
- What is not true?

01:21:39.380 --> 01:21:40.630
Have you gone mad?

01:21:43.463 --> 01:21:44.546
Of course, Bartolomé.

01:21:46.213 --> 01:21:47.463
Didn't you know?

01:22:10.463 --> 01:22:14.463
<i>Did you know, Fulgor, that she's the most
beautiful woman ever born to this earth?</i>

01:22:16.671 --> 01:22:18.796
<i>I began to believe I’d lost her forever.</i>

01:22:20.338 --> 01:22:22.505
<i>But I have no intention
of losing her again.</i>

01:22:25.296 --> 01:22:27.463
- You understand me, Fulgor?
- I do.

01:22:29.546 --> 01:22:31.588
Tell her father
we'll provide what he needs

01:22:31.588 --> 01:22:33.213
to keep working in the mines.

01:22:34.546 --> 01:22:37.838
I imagine it'll be easier to make the old
man disappear over there, don’t you think?

01:22:38.338 --> 01:22:39.463
Could be.

01:22:40.296 --> 01:22:41.505
We need it to be.

01:22:43.088 --> 01:22:44.713
She has to be orphaned.

01:22:46.088 --> 01:22:48.088
It's our duty to support those in need.

01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:54.088
And what if she finds out?

01:22:55.130 --> 01:22:56.338
Who's going to tell her?

01:22:57.213 --> 01:22:59.213
Between the two of us,
who's gonna tell her?

01:22:59.213 --> 01:23:00.921
No, surely no one.

01:23:00.921 --> 01:23:02.546
Forget "surely."

01:23:03.255 --> 01:23:05.296
Forget it, and you'll see
everything turns out fine.

01:23:07.171 --> 01:23:08.755
Let him keep working over there,

01:23:08.755 --> 01:23:10.796
but he shouldn't think
of taking his daughter.

01:23:11.296 --> 01:23:12.963
We'll take good care of her here.

01:23:13.921 --> 01:23:14.921
Tell him that, Fulgor.

01:23:20.171 --> 01:23:22.755
Once again,
I like how you operate, <i>patrón.</i>

01:23:24.130 --> 01:23:26.213
You're getting that youthful spirit back.

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:49.880
Let's go, boys.

01:23:50.671 --> 01:23:51.505
Boys.

01:23:54.838 --> 01:23:56.463
Welcome, <i>señora.</i>

01:23:56.463 --> 01:23:57.671
Please come in.

01:23:58.796 --> 01:23:59.796
This way.

01:24:06.088 --> 01:24:06.963
Susana.

01:24:12.046 --> 01:24:13.630
I'm Pedro Páramo.

01:24:14.796 --> 01:24:15.838
Pedro.

01:24:27.796 --> 01:24:30.380
<i>Señorita,</i> I'll go with you.

01:25:14.213 --> 01:25:15.755
Is that you, Bartolomé?

01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:47.546
<i>What have we done?</i>

01:25:49.171 --> 01:25:50.796
What's wrong, Damiana?

01:25:51.671 --> 01:25:52.838
Why did you scream?

01:25:55.130 --> 01:25:56.130
I didn't scream.

01:25:57.296 --> 01:25:58.713
You must have been dreaming.

01:26:00.546 --> 01:26:02.046
I told you I never dream.

01:26:02.880 --> 01:26:03.713
Never.

01:26:06.921 --> 01:26:09.588
Besides, I'm exhausted.

01:26:11.130 --> 01:26:14.213
You didn't put the cat out last night,
and he wouldn't let me sleep.

01:26:15.380 --> 01:26:17.921
The cat slept with me, between my legs.

01:26:18.630 --> 01:26:22.213
He was soaked,
so I let him stay in my bed out of pity.

01:26:22.921 --> 01:26:25.505
I'm telling you,
he spent the night doing circus tricks.

01:26:26.921 --> 01:26:30.213
Even though he is quite affectionate,
I don't want him here while I’m sleeping.

01:26:35.588 --> 01:26:37.046
I'm sad for you, Susana.

01:26:44.588 --> 01:26:45.921
Your father has died.

01:26:48.213 --> 01:26:49.421
He died the night before last,

01:26:49.421 --> 01:26:52.296
and today, they told us
that there's nothing to be done.

01:26:52.921 --> 01:26:54.296
That they buried him already.

01:26:55.921 --> 01:26:58.505
That the journey was too long
for them to bring him here.

01:27:03.755 --> 01:27:05.255
You're all alone now.

01:27:25.505 --> 01:27:26.713
So then, it was him.

01:27:41.296 --> 01:27:43.088
You came to say goodbye.

01:28:18.588 --> 01:28:20.046
Tell me what you see, Susana.

01:28:21.171 --> 01:28:23.130
I don't see anything, Papa.

01:28:24.255 --> 01:28:27.338
I’ll lower you some more.
Tell me when you reach the bottom.

01:28:31.088 --> 01:28:32.505
Try to find something.

01:28:34.463 --> 01:28:35.463
Money!

01:28:37.296 --> 01:28:38.880
Round disks of gold.

01:28:39.880 --> 01:28:41.005
Look for them, Susana.

01:28:57.588 --> 01:28:58.713
Susana!

01:29:01.796 --> 01:29:03.088
Susana!

01:29:06.005 --> 01:29:07.421
<i>Susana!</i>

01:29:11.213 --> 01:29:12.838
<i>Try to find more, Susana!</i>

01:29:13.421 --> 01:29:14.588
<i>Money!</i>

01:29:26.630 --> 01:29:27.796
Is that you, Father?

01:29:29.005 --> 01:29:31.421
I've come to comfort you, my child.

01:29:36.005 --> 01:29:38.088
Your heart is dying.

01:29:50.963 --> 01:29:53.338
Don't let your heart die out.

01:30:08.921 --> 01:30:10.046
Go away, Father.

01:30:12.130 --> 01:30:13.296
And don't come back.

01:30:16.338 --> 01:30:18.838
Why are you here if you're already dead?

01:30:37.713 --> 01:30:39.671
Now open it. There.

01:30:40.421 --> 01:30:41.880
Channel the water that way.

01:30:43.005 --> 01:30:44.171
Dig deeper.

01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:46.880
That way.

01:31:04.796 --> 01:31:06.046
I know that one.

01:31:07.171 --> 01:31:09.171
He’s the foreman over at the Media Luna.

01:31:18.338 --> 01:31:19.380
How can I help you?

01:31:20.796 --> 01:31:22.421
Do you work for Pedro Páramo?

01:31:24.963 --> 01:31:25.796
Yes.

01:31:25.796 --> 01:31:28.255
Go tell him we are revolutionaries.

01:31:28.796 --> 01:31:30.380
That we've come for his lands.

01:31:34.338 --> 01:31:35.588
- All right.
- Run!

01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:38.546
Go tell him we'll see him there.

01:31:39.421 --> 01:31:40.296
Run faster!

01:31:41.546 --> 01:31:42.963
Run faster, man!

01:31:42.963 --> 01:31:44.296
Faster!

01:32:14.588 --> 01:32:16.463
They didn't pay me no mind.

01:32:16.463 --> 01:32:19.796
Poor don Fulgor, he died with one foot up
and the other one down.

01:32:20.296 --> 01:32:22.921
Go tell those men
I'm here if they need anything.

01:32:22.921 --> 01:32:26.546
They should come deal with me.
What sort of revolutionaries are they?

01:32:26.546 --> 01:32:29.296
I don't know.
That's what they called themselves.

01:32:30.421 --> 01:32:32.505
But first, swing by La Consagración.

01:32:32.505 --> 01:32:34.380
You know El Tilcuate,
the one with one eye?

01:32:34.880 --> 01:32:37.338
- Tell him I need him quickly.
- Indeed, <i>patrón.</i>

01:33:08.130 --> 01:33:11.213
Gentlemen, what else can I do for you?

01:33:11.213 --> 01:33:14.880
Well, as you can see, we've taken up arms.

01:33:15.921 --> 01:33:16.921
And?

01:33:17.796 --> 01:33:20.296
And that's all.
You don't think that's enough?

01:33:21.005 --> 01:33:22.338
I mean, why have you done it?

01:33:23.005 --> 01:33:26.046
Because others have done it too.
Haven't you heard?

01:33:27.171 --> 01:33:31.796
Just wait for our instructions to come,
and then we'll let you know the cause.

01:33:31.796 --> 01:33:33.005
I know the cause.

01:33:34.130 --> 01:33:35.713
And if you want, I'll explain it.

01:33:39.255 --> 01:33:42.671
We've rebelled against the government
and your kind

01:33:42.671 --> 01:33:45.713
because we're tired
of putting up with you.

01:33:46.796 --> 01:33:48.630
The government for being scoundrels,

01:33:49.588 --> 01:33:54.963
and against you because you're
a bunch of greasy freeloaders and thieves.

01:33:56.046 --> 01:33:58.338
About Mr. Government, we'll say nothing.

01:33:59.463 --> 01:34:02.296
Because we'll tell them
what we want to say with bullets.

01:34:05.421 --> 01:34:07.671
How much do you need for your revolution?

01:34:07.671 --> 01:34:09.505
Perhaps I could help.

01:34:10.005 --> 01:34:12.838
The gentleman here
is making sense, Perseverancio.

01:34:12.838 --> 01:34:16.296
We need a rich friend to help us out.

01:34:16.296 --> 01:34:18.755
And who better than this <i>señor</i> right here?

01:34:19.421 --> 01:34:20.505
Let's see, Casildo!

01:34:21.213 --> 01:34:22.671
How much do we need?

01:34:22.671 --> 01:34:25.421
This guy wouldn't give water
to Saint Peter's rooster.

01:34:27.255 --> 01:34:29.130
Let's make the most of being here now

01:34:30.255 --> 01:34:33.588
and take everything he's got,
down to the corn stuck in his gullet.

01:34:33.588 --> 01:34:36.088
Calm down, Perseverancio.

01:34:36.796 --> 01:34:38.255
Let's come to an agreement.

01:34:39.421 --> 01:34:40.671
You talk, Casildo.

01:34:41.921 --> 01:34:42.921
Um...

01:34:44.005 --> 01:34:50.880
Well, I'd say around 20,000 pesos
would be a good start.

01:34:53.588 --> 01:34:56.296
Or maybe the <i>señor</i> considers
that small change,

01:34:56.296 --> 01:34:59.255
seeing how he's so excited to lend a hand.

01:35:00.713 --> 01:35:02.713
Let's say then, fifty thousand.

01:35:03.963 --> 01:35:04.963
Do you agree?

01:35:11.088 --> 01:35:12.838
I'll give you 100,000 pesos.

01:35:13.338 --> 01:35:14.588
How many are you?

01:35:15.088 --> 01:35:16.255
We're three hundred.

01:35:17.005 --> 01:35:22.088
All right. I'll lend you another 300 men
to grow your contingent.

01:35:22.755 --> 01:35:25.505
You'll have both the men
and the money within the week.

01:35:25.505 --> 01:35:29.171
The money's a gift, the men are on loan.

01:35:33.921 --> 01:35:35.088
I don't see why not.

01:35:35.921 --> 01:35:38.296
Then we'll see you in a week, <i>señores.</i>

01:35:38.296 --> 01:35:40.255
It's been a pleasure to meet you.

01:35:51.546 --> 01:35:53.546
Who do you figure is the one in charge?

01:35:56.171 --> 01:35:59.046
I'd say the one with a big gut
who sat in the middle

01:35:59.046 --> 01:36:00.630
and never once looked up.

01:36:01.588 --> 01:36:02.713
I'd bet it's him.

01:36:02.713 --> 01:36:04.088
No, Damasio.

01:36:04.588 --> 01:36:05.838
You're their boss.

01:36:06.421 --> 01:36:08.380
Or don't you want to join the revolt?

01:36:08.380 --> 01:36:10.505
I can hardly wait.

01:36:10.505 --> 01:36:12.546
Considering how much I like a good rumble.

01:36:12.546 --> 01:36:16.005
You've seen what it's all about,
so you don't need my advice.

01:36:16.005 --> 01:36:19.005
Gather 300 trusty men,
and join up with the rebels.

01:36:19.838 --> 01:36:21.880
You'll figure out the rest on your own.

01:36:22.463 --> 01:36:23.505
What about the money?

01:36:23.505 --> 01:36:25.171
Should I hand it over?

01:36:25.671 --> 01:36:27.505
I'll give you ten pesos for each man.

01:36:27.505 --> 01:36:29.755
Enough for their immediate expenses.

01:36:29.755 --> 01:36:32.671
Tell them I'm keeping the rest safe here
and at their disposal.

01:36:33.963 --> 01:36:35.963
Don't wander too far from my property,

01:36:35.963 --> 01:36:38.380
so if others come,
they'll see the land is occupied.

01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:41.255
And come see me when you can
or when you've got news.

01:36:41.255 --> 01:36:44.296
- It'll be done. See you, <i>patrón.</i>
- Go ahead.

01:36:54.046 --> 01:36:56.421
<i>Now she's the one speaking, Juan Preciado.</i>

01:36:57.630 --> 01:36:58.880
<i>What's she saying?</i>

01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:03.546
<i>She says
that she'd lose herself inside him,</i>

01:37:05.963 --> 01:37:08.296
<i>as she felt her flesh tear open.</i>

01:37:12.005 --> 01:37:14.046
<i>But that his death caused her more pain.</i>

01:37:15.463 --> 01:37:16.630
<i>That's what she's saying.</i>

01:37:17.338 --> 01:37:18.880
<i>Who's she talking about?</i>

01:37:21.463 --> 01:37:24.088
<i>Someone who died before her, surely.</i>

01:38:56.421 --> 01:38:57.630
Margarita.

01:39:02.171 --> 01:39:03.588
Open up, Margarita.

01:40:07.005 --> 01:40:08.880
Little piece of meat.

01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:21.338
It's the sand.

01:40:26.088 --> 01:40:27.671
Bathe with me.

01:40:31.005 --> 01:40:32.255
So much foam...

01:40:35.171 --> 01:40:36.671
When will this be over?

01:40:39.921 --> 01:40:41.463
Nothing can last this long.

01:40:43.588 --> 01:40:47.046
There's no memory,
no matter how intense, that won't fade.

01:40:49.130 --> 01:40:50.671
Maybe it's not a memory.

01:41:12.713 --> 01:41:13.671
Thirty years...

01:41:17.505 --> 01:41:19.088
I waited to have it all.

01:41:20.380 --> 01:41:23.671
Not just something,
but everything that could be had.

01:41:23.671 --> 01:41:24.671
So that...

01:41:26.130 --> 01:41:28.046
there would be nothing left to desire.

01:41:30.046 --> 01:41:31.296
Except you.

01:41:32.713 --> 01:41:33.921
The desire of you.

01:41:42.838 --> 01:41:44.921
When I learned you were finally returning,

01:41:47.255 --> 01:41:49.088
I wanted to embrace you...

01:41:50.296 --> 01:41:51.755
to wrap you in joy.

01:41:54.171 --> 01:41:55.338
And I cried, Susana.

01:41:57.213 --> 01:41:59.338
When I learned you'd finally be returning.

01:42:48.755 --> 01:42:49.880
<i>Señora.</i>

01:43:06.463 --> 01:43:08.796
Isn't it true
that the night is full of sin, Damiana?

01:43:10.505 --> 01:43:11.838
Yes, Susana.

01:43:16.255 --> 01:43:18.505
And what else is life if not sin?

01:43:27.505 --> 01:43:28.546
Don't you hear?

01:43:32.463 --> 01:43:34.296
Don't you hear how the earth grinds?

01:43:38.588 --> 01:43:39.796
No, Susana.

01:43:42.338 --> 01:43:43.421
I don't hear a thing.

01:43:47.338 --> 01:43:49.296
I'm not as fortunate as you.

01:43:51.630 --> 01:43:54.838
You'd be amazed by the things I hear.

01:44:14.505 --> 01:44:16.588
Do you believe in hell, Damiana?

01:44:18.588 --> 01:44:19.588
Yes, Susana.

01:44:21.630 --> 01:44:23.046
And in Heaven as well.

01:44:26.255 --> 01:44:27.963
I only believe in hell.

01:44:45.338 --> 01:44:46.505
How's the <i>señora?</i>

01:44:46.505 --> 01:44:48.338
Bad. Really bad.

01:44:56.588 --> 01:44:57.505
Susana?

01:45:01.546 --> 01:45:03.755
<i>I saw Doña Susanita die.</i>

01:45:05.046 --> 01:45:06.713
<i>What are you saying, Dorotea?</i>

01:45:06.713 --> 01:45:08.380
<i>What I just told you.</i>

01:45:09.921 --> 01:45:12.338
<i>I remember the light
in that window went out,</i>

01:45:12.338 --> 01:45:14.755
<i>after it had been lit
for more than three years.</i>

01:45:15.838 --> 01:45:17.213
<i>Night after night.</i>

01:45:19.255 --> 01:45:21.463
Good. Wait here, then.

01:45:33.296 --> 01:45:35.588
My mouth is filled with soil.

01:45:38.088 --> 01:45:39.296
Yes, Father.

01:45:40.171 --> 01:45:41.796
Don't say, "Yes, Father."

01:45:41.796 --> 01:45:44.213
Repeat what I tell you.

01:45:46.963 --> 01:45:48.505
What are you going to tell me?

01:45:50.255 --> 01:45:52.088
You'll hear my confession again?

01:45:53.046 --> 01:45:56.463
No, Susana.
I've just come to talk with you.

01:45:56.963 --> 01:45:58.713
To prepare you for death.

01:45:59.838 --> 01:46:00.921
Am I going to die?

01:46:03.546 --> 01:46:04.671
Yes, child.

01:46:09.005 --> 01:46:11.213
Then why don't you leave me in peace?

01:46:13.005 --> 01:46:14.671
I want to rest.

01:46:18.088 --> 01:46:19.755
I'll leave you in peace, Susana.

01:46:20.463 --> 01:46:23.630
As you repeat the words I say,

01:46:24.546 --> 01:46:26.296
you'll fall asleep.

01:46:26.796 --> 01:46:29.130
And no one will wake you up.

01:46:30.213 --> 01:46:31.296
All right, Father.

01:46:32.296 --> 01:46:33.588
I'll do as you ask.

01:46:36.380 --> 01:46:39.588
My mouth is filled with soil.

01:46:45.213 --> 01:46:47.963
<i>I swallow the foam of my saliva.</i>

01:46:48.963 --> 01:46:53.838
<i>I chew clumps of soil,
crawling with worms.</i>

01:46:56.380 --> 01:47:01.505
My mouth twists out of shape,
pierced by teeth.

01:47:03.255 --> 01:47:07.630
<i>The gelatin of my eyes melts.</i>

01:47:08.338 --> 01:47:11.755
<i>The hair burns in one lone blaze...</i>

01:47:17.213 --> 01:47:19.380
He sheltered me in his arms.

01:47:21.588 --> 01:47:22.838
He gave me love.

01:47:25.796 --> 01:47:27.296
There's more.

01:47:29.088 --> 01:47:30.630
The sight of God.

01:47:31.796 --> 01:47:37.296
The last fleeting image seen
by those condemned to eternal suffering.

01:47:38.921 --> 01:47:41.838
<i>The gentle light of His infinite Heaven.</i>

01:47:41.838 --> 01:47:44.421
<i>The joy of the cherubim.</i>

01:47:45.005 --> 01:47:47.463
God's joyful gaze.

01:47:49.130 --> 01:47:50.671
And not only that,

01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:57.171
all of it coalesced
with profound earthly sorrow.

01:48:04.755 --> 01:48:08.713
The marrow of our bones set ablaze.

01:48:10.713 --> 01:48:14.546
<i>The blood in our veins
turns to strings of fire.</i>

01:48:15.630 --> 01:48:19.963
<i>Forcing us to wallow in an immense pain...</i>

01:48:21.880 --> 01:48:23.671
<i>that never recedes...</i>

01:48:24.963 --> 01:48:28.546
<i>stoked by the wrath of the Lord.</i>

01:48:40.005 --> 01:48:42.213
You’ll appear before God.

01:48:43.421 --> 01:48:46.671
And His judgment of sinners is inhumane.

01:48:53.588 --> 01:48:55.088
Go now, Father.

01:48:57.130 --> 01:48:58.755
Don't fret over me.

01:49:00.630 --> 01:49:02.046
I'm at peace.

01:49:03.796 --> 01:49:05.546
And I want to sleep.

01:49:15.588 --> 01:49:16.588
Damiana.

01:49:17.463 --> 01:49:19.380
Please go cry somewhere else.

01:51:24.338 --> 01:51:27.338
<i>The tolling for that death
lasted longer than it should have.</i>

01:51:33.171 --> 01:51:35.796
<i>People began arriving from all over,</i>

01:51:35.796 --> 01:51:38.421
<i>drawn in by the ringing of the bells.</i>

01:51:53.921 --> 01:51:57.630
<i>And little by little,
things turned into a big party.</i>

01:51:58.713 --> 01:52:03.713
<i>Comala was teeming with people,
with celebrations, and noise.</i>

01:52:06.588 --> 01:52:08.963
Hey! She's in the air!

01:52:10.130 --> 01:52:12.213
Amazing!

01:52:14.755 --> 01:52:16.046
Don't get in the way!

01:52:32.755 --> 01:52:34.755
<i>The bells finally stopped ringing...</i>

01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:37.505
<i>...but the party continued.</i>

01:52:38.880 --> 01:52:41.171
<i>There was no way to make them understand</i>

01:52:41.171 --> 01:52:45.046
<i>it was mourning, days of mourning.</i>

01:54:20.546 --> 01:54:21.546
Fire!

01:54:49.046 --> 01:54:51.213
Don't keep standing there, Don Pedro.

01:54:53.546 --> 01:54:54.796
Sit down, at least.

01:54:56.630 --> 01:54:58.005
I'll cross my arms,

01:54:59.213 --> 01:55:01.421
and Comala will die of hunger.

01:56:15.713 --> 01:56:16.588
<i>Patrón.</i>

01:56:19.255 --> 01:56:21.671
Father Rentería has taken up arms.

01:56:22.921 --> 01:56:24.338
And why is that?

01:56:25.171 --> 01:56:29.546
Because the revolutionary government
has suspended holy services.

01:56:32.463 --> 01:56:34.463
Weren't you with Villa?

01:56:35.296 --> 01:56:37.213
Or was it Obregón?

01:56:39.088 --> 01:56:41.213
Peace has been made there, Don Pedro.

01:56:42.213 --> 01:56:43.463
We're on our own.

01:56:45.505 --> 01:56:46.505
What should we do?

01:56:47.505 --> 01:56:49.213
Join him or fight him?

01:56:50.255 --> 01:56:51.796
No question about it.

01:56:52.588 --> 01:56:54.255
Take the side of the government.

01:56:54.255 --> 01:56:56.171
But we're irregulars.

01:56:57.213 --> 01:56:58.796
They consider us rebels.

01:57:00.713 --> 01:57:02.463
Do what you want, then.

01:57:03.296 --> 01:57:05.296
I'll join up with the priest.

01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:07.338
I like how he yells.

01:57:08.171 --> 01:57:10.838
Besides, fighting on his side,
salvation is guaranteed.

01:57:18.130 --> 01:57:19.296
Well, <i>patrón...</i>

01:57:21.088 --> 01:57:22.213
I'll see you.

01:57:44.463 --> 01:57:46.421
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

01:58:18.130 --> 01:58:22.338
<i>Since Pedro Páramo threw the people out
and sat down on his</i> equipal <i>chair...</i>

01:58:24.046 --> 01:58:26.505
<i>the land became a wasteland
and was left in ruins.</i>

01:58:29.630 --> 01:58:31.796
<i>The town started emptying.</i>

01:58:32.796 --> 01:58:35.255
<i>All around, people wasted away.</i>

01:58:36.505 --> 01:58:38.755
<i>And Comala filled with farewells.</i>

01:58:41.380 --> 01:58:43.755
<i>I stayed because I had nowhere to go.</i>

01:58:45.838 --> 01:58:49.213
<i>But with the people, the charity
that kept me alive also left.</i>

01:58:50.880 --> 01:58:52.671
<i>And I started starving to death.</i>

01:58:55.171 --> 01:58:57.296
<i>After we found you,</i>

01:58:57.296 --> 01:58:59.880
<i>my bones were determined
to find some rest.</i>

01:59:01.130 --> 01:59:02.380
<i>What about your soul?</i>

01:59:03.921 --> 01:59:05.421
<i>Where do you think it went?</i>

01:59:07.671 --> 01:59:11.630
<i>It begged me to get back up
and carry on with my life.</i>

01:59:12.338 --> 01:59:16.255
<i>As if it hoped for some miracle
to cleanse my sins.</i>

01:59:17.713 --> 01:59:19.630
<i>I didn't even try.</i>

01:59:22.296 --> 01:59:24.421
<i>I opened my mouth to let it escape.</i>

01:59:26.046 --> 01:59:27.213
<i>And it took off.</i>

01:59:29.713 --> 01:59:33.588
<i>I felt when the thread of blood
that joined it to my heart</i>

01:59:33.588 --> 01:59:34.880
<i>fell onto my hands.</i>

01:59:39.671 --> 01:59:41.546
<i>I thought no one would mind me.</i>

01:59:44.796 --> 01:59:47.213
<i>I never get in anybody's way.</i>

01:59:50.546 --> 01:59:53.255
<i>I didn't even need my own space
here in the ground.</i>

01:59:54.921 --> 01:59:57.046
<i>They buried me in your grave,</i>

01:59:57.046 --> 02:00:00.171
<i>tucked away in the hollow of your arms.</i>

02:00:02.130 --> 02:00:06.546
<i>It occurred to me, I should be the one
holding you in my arms.</i>

02:00:32.505 --> 02:00:33.713
<i>What about Pedro Páramo?</i>

02:00:35.713 --> 02:00:39.713
<i>Years passed, and he was always there,
like a scarecrow.</i>

02:00:40.963 --> 02:00:43.713
<i>He'd forgotten about sleep and time.</i>

02:00:44.671 --> 02:00:48.630
<i>Because he was afraid of the nights
that filled the darkness with ghosts.</i>

02:00:50.130 --> 02:00:52.463
<i>To be locked up with his ghosts.</i>

02:00:53.296 --> 02:00:54.755
<i>That's what he was scared of.</i>

02:00:55.463 --> 02:00:56.546
Damiana!

02:00:58.338 --> 02:01:00.046
Come and see what this man wants.

02:01:29.005 --> 02:01:32.088
Give me some money to bury my wife.

02:01:33.505 --> 02:01:37.171
Deliver us, O Lord,
from the snares of the evil one.

02:01:39.046 --> 02:01:40.255
What did you say?

02:01:47.796 --> 02:01:51.755
I've come for a little something
to bury my wife.

02:01:52.255 --> 02:01:55.796
I was forced to sell my mules
to pay the doctor, but...

02:01:55.796 --> 02:01:57.588
Just go.

02:01:57.588 --> 02:01:59.588
It was all for nothing, you know?

02:02:02.963 --> 02:02:03.921
She's there...

02:02:05.921 --> 02:02:07.088
alone...

02:02:08.588 --> 02:02:10.421
enduring the damp air.

02:02:14.130 --> 02:02:18.338
Help! Somebody help us!

02:02:24.255 --> 02:02:25.505
Give me something.

02:02:32.380 --> 02:02:33.463
Give me something!

02:02:36.130 --> 02:02:37.505
Give me something!

02:02:58.338 --> 02:02:59.630
Are you all right, <i>patrón?</i>

02:03:17.713 --> 02:03:18.713
Let's go.

02:03:53.880 --> 02:03:55.088
It's me, Don Pedro.

02:03:57.963 --> 02:03:59.921
Would you like me
to bring out your lunch?

02:04:01.671 --> 02:04:02.713
I'm coming.

02:04:07.963 --> 02:04:09.005
I'm coming now.
