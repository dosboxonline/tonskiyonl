         The patient.           

18:23.871 --> 18:27.439
  A patient will come to you    
  at his moment of greatest     
  dread,                        

18:27.441 --> 18:30.909
  hand you a knife and say,     
  "Doctor, cut me open."        

18:30.911 --> 18:32.811
             Why?               

18:32.813 --> 18:35.046
     Because he trusts you.     

18:35.048 --> 18:38.750
     He trusts you the way      
     a child trusts.            

18:38.752 --> 18:41.953
 He trusts you to do no harm.   

18:43.957 --> 18:46.491
        The sad fact is,        

18:46.493 --> 18:48.827
     human beings are not       
     worthy of trust.           

18:49.930 --> 18:52.063
  It is human nature to lie,    

18:52.065 --> 18:55.434
 take shortcuts,                
 to lose your nerve, get tired, 

18:55.436 --> 18:57.903
         make mistakes.         

18:57.905 --> 19:01.473
 No rational patient would put  
 his trust in a human being,    

19:01.475 --> 19:03.708
 and we're not gonna let him!   

19:03.710 --> 19:06.111
     It is our mission here     

19:06.113 --> 19:10.215
 to rigorously and ruthlessly   
 train the humanity out of you  

19:10.217 --> 19:12.217
 and make you into something    
 better.                        

19:14.054 --> 19:16.655
    We're gonna make doctors    
    out of you.

19:33.807 --> 19:36.141
    Two years of studying.      
    I thought we'd have more    
    contact with patients.      

19:36.143 --> 19:37.642
         Didn't you?            

19:37.644 --> 19:40.679
         Hi. I'm Patch.         

19:40.681 --> 19:42.848
  You've just experienced       
  a North American greeting,    

19:42.850 --> 19:45.150
  whereby one person offers     
  a verbal label to another     

19:45.152 --> 19:47.686
 as an expression of welcome    
 and friendship.                

19:47.688 --> 19:50.255
 Lesbian. Ball-buster. Airhead. 
 Leech.                         

19:50.257 --> 19:52.824
     Whichever one of these     
     disgusts you the most,     
     take your pick.            

19:52.826 --> 19:54.726
          Please pass the word. 
            Well...             

19:54.728 --> 19:57.963
    I am not here to date.      
    I am not here to flirt.     
    I'm here to study.          

19:58.699 --> 19:59.998

20:00.667 --> 20:03.101
          Thank you.            

20:03.103 --> 20:06.705

 women with that kind           
 of raw efficiency.             

20:06.707 --> 20:09.140
 Well, you just met your match. 

20:09.142 --> 20:11.510
         Truman Schiff.         
         Patch Adams.           

20:11.512 --> 20:13.945
  Nice to meet you, Truman.     

20:13.947 --> 20:17.816
    Will you go out with me?

 <i> What a lovely, lovely world</i>   
 <i> it should be ¶</i>                

20:20.087 --> 20:22.687
     HUNTER: May I ask you      
     one question?              

20:22.689 --> 20:25.090
  Do you buy everything         
  the dean was saying today?    

20:25.092 --> 20:26.725
      What do you mean?         

20:26.727 --> 20:29.344
    I mean, that whole drill    
    sergeant thing.             

20:29.345 --> 20:31.962
  "We're gonna make doctors     
  out of you medical scum.      

20:31.965 --> 20:34.566
        "Now drop down          
        and give me 20."        

20:34.568 --> 20:36.535
    That whole marine thing.    

20:36.537 --> 20:39.638
    We're not even gonna see    
    a patient until             
    the third year.             

20:39.640 --> 20:41.673
 Up until then,                 
 it's just memorizing facts.    

20:41.675 --> 20:43.308

  Why don't they just shove     
  the book up...                

20:43.310 --> 20:45.911
    Right here on the colon.    
    That's where it's going     
    anyway.                     

20:45.913 --> 20:47.312
      Thanks very much.         

20:47.314 --> 20:48.780
     So, why do you wanna       
     be a doctor?               

20:48.782 --> 20:50.081
        I want to help.         

20:50.083 --> 20:51.783
 I want to connect with people. 

20:51.785 --> 20:54.085
 A doctor interacts with people 
 at their most vulnerable.      

20:54.087 --> 20:57.856
 He offers treatment, but he    
 also offers counsel and hope.  

20:57.858 --> 21:00.992
  That's why I love the idea    
  of being a doctor.            

21:00.994 --> 21:03.828
 I've always been fascinated    
 by the development             
 of the human mind.             

21:03.830 --> 21:05.196
     Ah. Pumping neurons.       

21:05.198 --> 21:08.900
     We start out so open       
     and spontaneous.           

21:08.902 --> 21:12.037
 We're real individuals.        
 Then somewhere along the way   
 we're drawn to conform.        

21:12.039 --> 21:14.806
 It's as if we're conditioned   
 by programmed responses.       

21:14.808 --> 21:16.575
      Well, that's true.        

21:16.577 --> 21:18.677
 But sometimes you can alter    
 the programmed response        

21:18.679 --> 21:22.347
    just by changing some       
    of the conditions,          
    altering the parameters.    

21:22.950 --> 21:24.649
        Let me show you.        

21:26.019 --> 21:28.086
     We'll call it the          
     "hello" experiment.        

21:28.088 --> 21:29.988
 The goal will be to break      
 through programmed response    

21:29.990 --> 21:32.123
 by changing normal parameters  

21:32.125 --> 21:34.659
 and getting a new emotional    
 response from the person.      

21:34.661 --> 21:36.261
     Ready to enter data.       

21:37.931 --> 21:39.965
             Hello.             

21:39.967 --> 21:41.132
             Hi.                

21:46.340 --> 21:48.173
     Wait. I don't get it.      

21:48.175 --> 21:50.709
 "Hi" is a programmed response. 

21:50.711 --> 21:51.743
         I reached her.         

21:51.745 --> 21:53.011
        You scared her.         

21:53.013 --> 21:56.147
     No. Wait. Wait for it.     

21:56.917 --> 21:58.016

            A smile.            

22:02.723 --> 22:05.890
     Ten seconds. Victory.      

22:05.892 --> 22:08.026
        There's more.           
        Come, my friend.        

22:09.730 --> 22:11.262
             Hi.                
             Howdy!             

22:11.264 --> 22:13.298
      See? Response time        
      is diminishing.           

22:13.300 --> 22:16.001
     Yesterday I made           
     12 random phone calls.     

22:16.003 --> 22:19.671
 I talked to one man named Dale 
 for three hours. He told me    
 amazing things.                

22:19.673 --> 22:22.774
 But what does this all prove,  
 other than you're out          
 of your mind?                  

22:22.776 --> 22:24.776
 What's the difference between  
 a doctor and a scientist?      

22:24.778 --> 22:27.145
     And don't say salary.      

22:27.147 --> 22:31.082
  People. We want to become     
  doctors because we want       
  to help people.               

22:31.084 --> 22:33.084
 I want to be a pediatrician.   

22:33.086 --> 22:35.120
     Okay, little people.       

22:35.122 --> 22:39.024
  The point is, we have to      
  treat the patient as well     
  as the disease.               

22:39.026 --> 22:42.994
 That's why we have to dive     
 into people, wade into the sea

  I think it's the question.    

33:00.546 --> 33:02.880
  Actually,                     
  I don't find the question     
  here in the outline.

33:17.930 --> 33:19.964
      Don't you think I         
      see through you?          

33:19.966 --> 33:21.932
    You act like                
    you're above the system     

33:21.934 --> 33:23.668
     when you're really         
     just a nonconformist.      

33:23.670 --> 33:26.003
    You have to get             
    under the fingernails       
    of any authority figure     

33:26.005 --> 33:28.873

     as a way of dealing        
     with some insecurity.

    Yeah, odds are one          
    of the five of us           
    sitting here, actually.     

33:39.819 --> 33:42.620
    I have another question.    

33:42.622 --> 33:45.690
 In a perfect system,           
 why are patients               
 referred to by their disease,  

33:45.692 --> 33:48.726
 as in "that                    
 interesting cancer patient,"   
 and not by their name?         

33:48.728 --> 33:51.662
 It certainly isn't to be mean. 
 It's to prevent transference.  

33:51.664 --> 33:52.730
     And why is that bad?       

33:52.732 --> 33:53.931
 And the one flunking out is?   

33:53.933 --> 33:56.000
 Can we get back to the tongue? 

33:56.002 --> 33:58.803
    What if a doctor            
    becomes emotionally         
    involved with a patient?    

33:58.805 --> 34:00.771
  Does a doctor explode? No.    

34:00.773 --> 34:04.709
 Who came up with these rules?  
 It's against                   
 the Hippocratic oath, I think. 

34:04.711 --> 34:07.912
     I don't really have        
     time for this. Sorry.

57:39.824 --> 57:44.427
    I also have                 
    a source that informs me    
    that your antics            

57:44.429 --> 57:46.763
     have improved              
     the quality of life        
     for the patients.          

57:46.765 --> 57:49.832

 they take less medication,

      bedpan at a nurse         

57:52.904 --> 57:54.370

 of the attendant,              
 as part of the curriculum,     

58:05.049 --> 58:08.351
     and you will steer         
     clear of Dean Walcott.     

58:08.353 --> 58:11.254
    Yes, sir.                   
    So I'm still in school?     

58:12.457 --> 58:14.390
        I wouldn't send         
        my laundry out,

    You know, my antibiotics    
    cost 100 bucks a month.

 I had a sprained ankle.        

01:05:29.827 --> 01:05:32.661

  do they really need to do     
  all those tests?              

01:05:32.663 --> 01:05:34.780
 You know what they need to do. 

01:05:34.781 --> 01:05:36.898
 The government needs           
 to pay for health insurance.   

01:05:36.901 --> 01:05:39.902
  Health insurance companies

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:46.769

    Tell me                     
    the first thing you see.

     Something with a nose.

    a building with a nose.

        A free hospital.

  and I need you to help me.    

01:06:58.883 --> 01:07:02.318
     It'll be the first fun     
     hospital in the world.     

01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:04.353
     It'll be a totally         
     free-form building.

    I can't write that fast.

      I can't slow down.        

01:07:10.628 --> 01:07:13.796
    We'll use humor to          
    heal pain and suffering.

        have to help me.

01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:37.820

             Yes.

     be easy, but you said      

01:07:39.757 --> 01:07:41.423
     anything worth             
     doing is difficult.        

01:07:41.425 --> 01:07:42.825
            Look...             

01:07:43.627 --> 01:07:46.528
    I'm not like you, Patch.    

01:07:46.530 --> 01:07:48.397
     I want the white coat.     
     I want people              

01:07:48.399 --> 01:07:49.798
     to call me "doctor"        
     more than anything.        

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.217
    I want the recognition.     

01:07:52.218 --> 01:07:54.635

    in the eyes of

      power and control,        
      all right?                

01:08:01.645 --> 01:08:02.778

01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:03.946

     I'm scared to death.

     and you talk about         
     life without limits,       

01:08:14.058 --> 01:08:17.426
    you know,                   
    and breaking the rules.

     very romantic.

 I can help you. I swear I can. 

01:08:42.853 --> 01:08:44.051

     for a couple of years.     

01:09:19.657 --> 01:09:21.122
        Not because he's        
        accident-prone.         

01:09:21.125 --> 01:09:23.576
     No. His father             
     died two years ago.        

01:09:23.577 --> 01:09:26.028
 Since then he's been subject   
 to fits of depression          
 and self-mutilation.

     not getting me fired.

01:09:42.078 --> 01:09:44.645
     You're a good thing        
     for this hospital.         

01:09:44.648 --> 01:09:47.216
    You remind me of myself     
    when I first                
    started out on fire,        

01:09:47.218 --> 01:09:49.251

     of that after a while.

  The system is what it is.     
  It's not perfect,             
  but it's all we have.         

01:09:55.626 --> 01:09:59.828
    Why does it have            
    to be all we have?          
    Why can't it be changed?

01:12:07.858 --> 01:12:10.192
         Our new home.          

01:12:10.194 --> 01:12:13.161
  Carin, what do you think?     

01:12:13.931 --> 01:12:16.031
     How did you find this?     

01:12:16.033 --> 01:12:17.799
             Him.               

01:12:17.801 --> 01:12:22.104
     Arthur Mendelson.          
     All this is his,           
     the land, the cottage.     

01:12:22.106 --> 01:12:24.640
  He's letting us borrow it     
  till we can purchase it.      

01:12:24.642 --> 01:12:27.743
    Mr. Mendelson, I realize    
    that under the terms        
    of your commitment,         

01:12:27.745 --> 01:12:30.379
    you retained                
    control of your assets.     
    Nevertheless...             

01:12:30.381 --> 01:12:32.814

 about proctology yet, Patch?   

01:12:32.816 --> 01:12:34.316

         A little bit.          

01:12:34.318 --> 01:12:37.152
    Take care of this           
    asshole for me, will ya?    

01:12:37.154 --> 01:12:38.787

01:12:38.789 --> 01:12:40.055

        You have a gift.        

01:32:14.530 --> 01:32:16.497
 You have a way with people.

    You know, they like you.    

01:32:23.439 --> 01:32:26.040

    I can't learn this way.

  What do You want from me?     

01:32:55.037 --> 01:32:56.871
     Yeah, I could do it.

  enormous amounts of pain.

 that day on compassion.

 There are standards and codes. 

01:37:15.598 --> 01:37:18.565
 You make                       
 the patients and everyone      
 else around you uncomfortable.

 But the reality is you are not 
 cut out to be a physician.

     is make sure your head     

01:37:34.850 --> 01:37:36.483
     is a dick and it's         
     attached to your neck.

  you're excessively happy?

    Isn't that good?

      becoming a doctor.

     think I'm using you.

      You have one shot.        

01:38:34.877 --> 01:38:36.610
     You'd have to              
     appeal to the state        
     medical board.             

01:38:36.612 --> 01:38:38.345
     How does that work?        

01:38:38.347 --> 01:38:40.981
 You claim that a prejudice     
 and injustice has occurred.

 They'll be

 They'll have to investigate.   

01:38:43.252 --> 01:38:44.818
          Then what?            

01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:47.754
 They'll review your grades,    
 which is good,

  you're almost

  but mostly your behavior.     

01:38:53.562 --> 01:38:55.963

      idea what Walcott         
      has on you?

    They draw their own law.    

01:39:10.446 --> 01:39:13.013
 You'll have to get their focus 
 on your high                   
 marks and off of this.         

01:39:13.015 --> 01:39:14.948

    You're almost a doctor.     

01:39:19.388 --> 01:39:22.289
 They're a panel of doctors.    

01:39:22.291 --> 01:39:25.659
      Just think of             
      them as your peers        
      and return these.         

01:39:26.562 --> 01:39:27.728

 You've been                    
 accused of practicing          
 medicine without a license.    

01:40:03.732 --> 01:40:06.066
      That's a very             
      grave charge, son.        

01:40:06.068 --> 01:40:08.402
  Are you aware that            
  it's unlawful to practice     

01:40:08.404 --> 01:40:10.437

      a medical license?        

01:40:10.439 --> 01:40:12.472
        Yes, sir, I am.         

01:40:12.474 --> 01:40:15.942
 Are you aware that             
 running a medical clinic       
 without the proper licensing   

01:40:15.944 --> 01:40:19.813
  can place both                
  you and the public            
  in a great deal of danger?    

01:40:20.683 --> 01:40:22.783
    Is a home a clinic, sir?    

01:40:22.785 --> 01:40:25.852
 If you are admitting patients  
 and treating them,             

01:40:25.854 --> 01:40:28.322

    define treatment for me?    

01:40:32.361 --> 01:40:34.728
     Yes. Treatment would       
     be defined as the care     

01:40:34.730 --> 01:40:37.030
  of a patient                  
  seeking medical attention.    

01:40:38.600 --> 01:40:42.035

 I live with several people.    
 They come and go               
 as they please.                

01:40:44.606 --> 01:40:46.707

     whatever help I can.

          Mr. Adams,            

01:40:48.544 --> 01:40:52.045
    have you or have            
    you not been treating       
    patients at your ranch?     

01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:58.018
      Everyone who              
      comes to the ranch        
      is a patient, yes.

        (ALL MURMURING)         

01:41:03.441 --> 01:41:05.057

 to the ranch is also a doctor. 

01:41:06.562 --> 01:41:07.761
          I'm sorry?            

01:41:09.098 --> 01:41:11.365
    Every person who comes      
    to the ranch is in need     

01:41:11.367 --> 01:41:13.934
    of some form of             
    physical or mental help.    

01:41:14.770 --> 01:41:16.503
      They're patients.         

01:41:16.505 --> 01:41:18.672
     But also every person      
     who comes to the ranch     

01:41:18.674 --> 01:41:21.641
     is in charge of taking     
     care of someone else.

 Whether it's cooking for them, 
 cleaning them                  

01:41:23.846 --> 01:41:26.113
     or even as simple          
     a task as listening.       

01:41:26.882 --> 01:41:29.483
    That makes them doctors.    

01:41:29.485 --> 01:41:31.852
    I use that term broadly,    
    but is not a doctor         

01:41:31.854 --> 01:41:34.421
     someone who                
     helps someone else?        

01:41:34.423 --> 01:41:36.923
    When did the term           
    "doctor" get treated        
    with such reverence, as,    

01:41:36.925 --> 01:41:38.558
        "Right this way,        
        Doctor Smith,"          

01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:41.027
 or, "Excuse me, Dr. Scholl,    
 what wonderful footpads,"      

01:41:41.029 --> 01:41:44.865
 or, "Pardon me, Dr. Patterson, 
 but your                       
 flatulence has no odor"?       

01:41:44.867 --> 01:41:46.466
        (ALL MURMURING)         

01:41:48.003 --> 01:41:51.071
    At what point in history    
    did a doctor become more    

01:41:51.073 --> 01:41:53.173
      than a trusted            
      and learned friend        

01:41:53.175 --> 01:41:56.576
        who visited and         
        treated the ill?        

01:41:56.578 --> 01:41:58.812
  Now, you ask me if I've       
  been practicing medicine.     

01:41:58.814 --> 01:42:01.782
 Well, if this means opening    
 your door to those in need,    

01:42:01.784 --> 01:42:03.183
         those in pain,         

01:42:04.520 --> 01:42:06.987
      caring for them,          
      listening to them,        

01:42:06.989 --> 01:42:09.823
     applying a cold cloth      
     until a fever breaks.      

01:42:09.825 --> 01:42:11.992
 If this is                     
 practicing medicine,           
 if this is treating a patient, 

01:42:11.994 --> 01:42:15.462
        then I am guilty        
        as charged, sir.        

01:42:15.464 --> 01:42:18.899
      Did you consider          
      the ramifications         
      of your actions?          

01:42:18.901 --> 01:42:21.034
     What if one of your        
     patients had died?         

01:42:21.036 --> 01:42:23.570
 What's wrong with death, sir?  

01:42:23.572 --> 01:42:25.939
     What are we so             
     mortally afraid of?        

01:42:25.941 --> 01:42:28.775
 Why can't we treat death with  
 a certain amount of            
 humanity and dignity           

01:42:28.777 --> 01:42:31.077
 and decency and, God forbid,   
 maybe even humor?              

01:42:32.147 --> 01:42:34.514
    Death is not the enemy,     
    gentlemen.                  

01:42:34.516 --> 01:42:36.149
     If we're gonna fight       
     a disease, let's fight     

01:42:36.151 --> 01:42:37.751
  one of the most               
  terrible diseases of all,     

01:42:37.753 --> 01:42:39.619
         indifference.          

01:42:39.621 --> 01:42:42.889
 Now, I've sat in your schools  
 and heard people               
 lecture on transference        

01:42:42.891 --> 01:42:45.459
  and professional distance.    

01:42:45.461 --> 01:42:47.627
 Transference is inevitable,    
 sir.                           

01:42:47.629 --> 01:42:50.764
  Every human being             
  has an impact on another.     

01:42:50.766 --> 01:42:54.100
 Why don't we want that in      
 a patient-doctor relationship? 

01:42:54.102 --> 01:42:58.505
 That's why I've                
 listened to your teachings,    
 and I believe they're wrong.   

01:42:58.507 --> 01:43:02.509
 A doctor's mission should be   
 not just to prevent death      

01:43:02.511 --> 01:43:04.611
     but also to improve        
     the quality of life.       

01:43:04.613 --> 01:43:07.547
      That's why you            
      treat a disease,          
      you win, you lose.        

01:43:07.549 --> 01:43:10.250
     You treat a person,        
     I guarantee you,           

01:43:10.252 --> 01:43:12.719
 you win,                       
 no matter what the outcome.    

01:43:14.890 --> 01:43:18.492
 Now here today, this room      
 is full of medical students.   

01:43:18.494 --> 01:43:19.893
        Don't let them          
        anesthetize you.        

01:43:19.895 --> 01:43:23.263
 Don't let them numb you out    
 to the miracle of life.        

01:43:23.265 --> 01:43:26.967
 Always live in                 
 awe of the glorious            
 mechanism of the human body.   

01:43:26.969 --> 01:43:30.237
  Let that be                   
  the focus of your studies     
  and not a quest for grades    

01:43:30.239 --> 01:43:33.573
  which'll give you no idea     
  what kind of                  
  doctor you will become.       

01:43:33.575 --> 01:43:35.275
     MAN: Please turn           
     and address the board.     

01:43:35.277 --> 01:43:37.878
  Don't wait till               
  you're on the ward            
  to get your humanity back.    

01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:40.780
 Start your                     
 interviewing skills.           
 Start talking to strangers.    

01:43:40.782 --> 01:43:43.583
     Talk to your friends,      
     talk to wrong numbers,     
     everyone.                  

01:43:43.585 --> 01:43:44.684
          Mr. Adams!            

01:43:44.686 --> 01:43:45.886
  And cultivate friendships     

01:43:45.888 --> 01:43:48.021
      with those amazing        
      people in the back        

01:43:48.023 --> 01:43:50.090
 of the room,                   
 nurses that could teach you.   

01:43:50.092 --> 01:43:51.758
      They've been with         
      people every day.         

01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:53.159
    They wade                   
    through blood and shit.     

01:43:53.161 --> 01:43:55.562
     They have                  
     a wealth of knowledge,     

01:43:55.564 --> 01:43:57.531
 and so do                      
 the professors you respect.    

01:43:57.533 --> 01:43:59.599
  The ones who are not dead     
  from the heart up.            

01:43:59.601 --> 01:44:01.835
    Share their compassion.     
    Let that be contagious.     

01:44:01.837 --> 01:44:04.571
 Mr. Adams, I demand that you   
 turn and address the board.    

01:44:04.573 --> 01:44:07.774
 Sir, I want to be              
 a doctor with all my heart.    

01:44:21.623 --> 01:44:24.724
 I wanted to become a doctor    
 so I could serve others,       

01:44:24.726 --> 01:44:27.260
     and because of that        
     I've lost everything,      

01:44:27.262 --> 01:44:29.996
      but I've also             
      gained everything.        

01:44:29.998 --> 01:44:32.132
     I've shared                
     the lives of patients      

01:44:32.134 --> 01:44:34.334
      and staff members         
      at the hospital.          

01:44:34.336 --> 01:44:37.337
    I've laughed with them.     
    I've cried with them.       

01:44:38.340 --> 01:44:41.041
     This is what I want        
     to do with my life.        

01:44:43.278 --> 01:44:46.279
  And as God is my witness,     

01:44:46.281 --> 01:44:48.081
     no matter what your        
     decision today, sir,       

01:44:48.083 --> 01:44:53.286
    I will still become         
    the best damn doctor        
    the world has ever seen.    

01:44:55.991 --> 01:44:59.092
 Now you have the ability       
 to prevent me from graduating. 

01:44:59.094 --> 01:45:03.597
 You can keep me from getting   
 the title and the white coat.  

01:45:03.599 --> 01:45:05.665
     But you can't control      
     my spirit, gentlemen.      

01:45:05.667 --> 01:45:07.667
      You can't keep            
      me from learning.         

01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:09.603
      You can't keep            
      me from studying.         

01:45:09.605 --> 01:45:12.105
     So you have a choice,      
     you could have me          

01:45:12.107 --> 01:45:14.741
 as a professional colleague,   
 passionate,                    

01:45:14.743 --> 01:45:18.144
    or you can have me as an    
    outspoken outsider,         
    still adamant.              

01:45:18.146 --> 01:45:21.081
 Either way, I'll probably      
 still be viewed as a thorn.    

01:45:21.083 --> 01:45:23.817
 But I promise you one thing.   

01:45:23.819 --> 01:45:26.119
      I am a thorn that         
      will not go away.         

01:45:29.291 --> 01:45:30.757
         Is that all?           

01:45:33.695 --> 01:45:35.161
        I hope not, sir.        

01:45:38.667 --> 01:45:40.300
    We will adjourn briefly.    

01:45:53.715 --> 01:45:54.381
          (CHUCKLES)            

01:46:26.415 --> 01:46:27.881
          Thank you.            

01:47:00.882 --> 01:47:02.215
         Hunter Adams.          

01:47:08.390 --> 01:47:12.092
     We find your methods       
     less than appealing.       

01:47:12.094 --> 01:47:15.862
    Your appearance and your    
    demeanor do not reflect     

01:47:15.864 --> 01:47:17.464
 what we believe is necessary   

01:47:17.466 --> 01:47:19.933
     to earn a patient's        
     trust and respect.         

01:47:22.003 --> 01:47:25.739
 You openly                     
 accuse us of adhering          
 to time-honored practices that 

01:47:25.741 --> 01:47:28.007
      for years have            
      been the backbone         

01:47:28.009 --> 01:47:30.009
     of the entire              
     medical institution.       

01:47:32.881 --> 01:47:34.180
            However,            

01:47:35.183 --> 01:47:38.051
        we find no fault        
        in your attempts        

01:47:38.053 --> 01:47:40.487
     to improve the quality     
     of life around you.        

01:47:42.124 --> 01:47:44.824
     We find no                 
     fault in your desire       

01:47:44.826 --> 01:47:47.260
  to expand upon                
  existing medical practices    

01:47:47.896 --> 01:47:49.429
         and theories.          

01:47:49.431 --> 01:47:51.998
     We applaud your            
     love of the patient.       

01:47:53.401 --> 01:47:55.535
  Your grades are among         
  the highest in your class,    

01:47:55.537 --> 01:47:58.471
    and, therefore, we find     
    no merit in the decision    

01:47:58.473 --> 01:48:01.474
    to block your graduation    
    from medical school.        

01:48:08.250 --> 01:48:12.452
  Now, along with your crass    
  and disdainful behavior,      

01:48:14.055 --> 01:48:16.122
 you carry with you a flame,    

01:48:17.259 --> 01:48:20.160
  which one could only hope     

01:48:20.161 --> 01:48:23.062
 would spread

  I think matters like this     

01:48:28.003 --> 01:48:31.571
    could best be solved        
    if you yourself             
    would practice a little
