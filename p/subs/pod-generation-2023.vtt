<i> Good morning, Rachel.
Did you sleep well?</i>

03:40.747 --> 03:43.924
Mm, great! Thanks, Elena.

03:47.536 --> 03:50.060
<i> I have the results
from your gut test.</i>

03:51.888 --> 03:54.326
<i>Congratulations!
Your gut is getting smarter.</i>

03:55.631 --> 03:58.199
<i>Your microbiome
is showing good diversity.</i>

03:58.417 --> 04:00.375
<i>Friendly bacteria
are thriving.</i>

04:03.378 --> 04:05.554
<i>Your serotonin seems
a bit low today.</i>

04:05.772 --> 04:08.340
<i>I'd like to add a Nature Pod
session in your schedule.</i>

04:08.557 --> 04:10.385
<i>It's been three weeks now.</i>

04:10.559 --> 04:14.084
Yeah, I know, but this week
is really tight, Elena. Sorry.

04:15.564 --> 04:18.132
When did I wear
Blizzard Pearl last, Elena?

04:18.350 --> 04:20.047
<i> Last Thursday.</i>

04:20.265 --> 04:22.615
<i>I suggest
Silver Fossil for today.</i>

04:24.834 --> 04:26.009
Yeah.

04:37.107 --> 04:38.674
There it is.

04:43.288 --> 04:44.680
No, no, no!

04:46.291 --> 04:47.770
I gotta go to work.

04:47.944 --> 04:50.033
- Ten minutes?
- No.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.905
- Five minutes?
- Mm-mm.

04:55.169 --> 04:56.779
- Bye.
- Bye.

05:20.150 --> 05:22.022
<i> I guess today is...</i>

05:23.023 --> 05:25.155
<i>t-shirt, Alvy.</i>

05:35.557 --> 05:37.951
<i>Today, our national
Bliss index is up by three--</i>

05:38.125 --> 05:39.996
Thanks, Elena, not now.

05:41.476 --> 05:44.914
<i> Since last week, your
Bliss index has been neutral.</i>

05:45.088 --> 05:46.916
There you go.

05:47.134 --> 05:49.179
<i> How can we make you
more blissful, Alvy?</i>

05:54.707 --> 05:58.014
Your coffee is ready. Alvy.

05:58.188 --> 06:00.103
<i> Ah, no.</i>

06:00.843 --> 06:03.019
<i>I did not hear the magic word, Alvy.</i>

06:03.193 --> 06:05.021
Magic word. Elena.

06:07.589 --> 06:10.853
<i> Enjoy your toast,
well done.</i>

06:12.638 --> 06:14.727
<i>Breakfast is served.</i>

07:05.517 --> 07:08.041
Our Lenas
have completed their training

07:08.215 --> 07:11.740
so it's time to let them go.
A big congrats to everyone.

07:18.660 --> 07:20.183
Now I'd like to introduce you

07:20.357 --> 07:22.621
to our next generation
of cognitive assistants,

07:22.795 --> 07:24.405
our Mashas.

07:24.579 --> 07:26.668
Through their Deep Learning
training with you,

07:26.842 --> 07:29.279
our Mashas will become
Cognitive Executives.

07:29.454 --> 07:32.674
In two months, they should take over
your client portfolios,

07:32.848 --> 07:36.548
as you will be in charge
of an exclusive new set

07:36.722 --> 07:38.724
of Tastemaker
and Influencer accounts.

07:39.899 --> 07:43.642
So are we at risk
of becoming... redundant?

07:44.947 --> 07:48.951
Progress has never made
anyone redundant.
It's here to help.

07:49.125 --> 07:50.736
Thank you, Rachel.

07:51.737 --> 07:53.695
We're so excited.

07:53.869 --> 07:56.611
I can feel our Mashas
are eager to jump in
and get started.

07:56.785 --> 07:58.787
So, big round of applause, everyone.

08:02.661 --> 08:07.753
And now let's get back to work
because now is our future.

08:11.757 --> 08:13.976
Rachel, sorry,
do you have a second?

08:14.150 --> 08:16.762
-  Yeah, of course.
- Please, thank you.

08:17.676 --> 08:19.591
I just wanted to let you know

08:19.765 --> 08:23.072
we're really pleased
with your work.
We're thinking maybe

08:23.246 --> 08:24.857
it's time for a promotion.

08:25.031 --> 08:27.381
-  Oh, wow.
- Um...

08:27.903 --> 08:30.819
Any family changes
we should be made aware of?

08:30.993 --> 08:32.647
Not that I can think of.

08:32.821 --> 08:35.258
Your husband,
his profession is not listed.

08:35.824 --> 08:37.783
Oh, right.

08:37.957 --> 08:40.568
Yeah, so he's a botanist.

08:41.830 --> 08:43.484
So he studies plants

08:43.658 --> 08:46.313
and plant like things.

08:47.488 --> 08:50.404
He also teaches
hologram plant design.

08:51.013 --> 08:53.407
So you're
the primary source of income?

08:53.581 --> 08:55.670
Well, at the moment, yeah.

08:55.844 --> 09:00.022
And any plans
on extending the family?

09:03.504 --> 09:07.334
Well,
I'm sure we will at one point.

09:07.508 --> 09:09.379
Not in the near-near future,

09:09.554 --> 09:11.556
Er... but soon.

09:11.730 --> 09:13.122
But not, you know...

09:13.296 --> 09:16.082
not immediately,
like right now.

09:17.736 --> 09:22.349
Rachel,
you're having a great year.

09:22.523 --> 09:25.744
It'd be a pity
to lose that momentum.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.094
The Womb Center company

09:28.268 --> 09:30.923
has just been added under
our corporate umbrella.

09:31.097 --> 09:33.186
If you ever consider
going down that route.

09:33.360 --> 09:35.449
We could even help
with the down payment.

09:35.623 --> 09:36.972
Wow!

09:37.146 --> 09:39.540
It is our hottest perk.

09:39.714 --> 09:41.760
We just want to make sure
we retain

09:41.934 --> 09:45.372
the best and brightest women.

09:46.678 --> 09:49.637
Absolutely.
That's...

09:53.510 --> 09:55.382
Elena suggested we should
schedule a Nature Pod session.

09:55.556 --> 09:57.689
This week is really insane.

09:57.906 --> 09:59.255
<i> Only 20 minutes--</i>

09:59.429 --> 10:01.040
Maybe at lunchtime?

10:01.257 --> 10:03.216
<i> Thank you, Rachel.
I'll work on it.</i>

10:05.261 --> 10:07.263
Your Happy Light is on, Rachel.

10:07.437 --> 10:09.439
Yep, I can see that.

10:09.657 --> 10:11.790
I can feel some irritation
in your voice.

10:12.529 --> 10:16.229
<i>Next time, would you rather
have me not mention
the Happy Light is on?</i>

10:16.925 --> 10:18.579
That would be great.

10:18.797 --> 10:20.146
<i> Thank you, Rachel,
for helping me</i>

10:20.363 --> 10:21.930
<i>with my Deep Learning.</i>

10:22.104 --> 10:24.585
Do we have an update
on the Zach Meyer profile?

10:24.803 --> 10:28.458
He's at only 22 430 likes.

10:28.676 --> 10:31.418
<i>His combo rating has dropped
by 2.5%.</i>

10:31.592 --> 10:33.768
Well, do we have any idea why?

10:33.986 --> 10:36.728
<i> He sold part
of his NFT collection.</i>

10:39.252 --> 10:41.776
You have an incoming call,
Rachel. 1-800-WOMB.

10:45.867 --> 10:48.653
Hi, this is a message
for Rachel Novy.

10:48.870 --> 10:51.568
<i>Hi, Rachel. This is Rebecca
at the Womb Center.</i>

10:51.786 --> 10:54.571
<i>We're happy to tell you
our waitlist has had
some movement.</i>

10:54.789 --> 10:56.399
<i>A spot has just opened up.</i>

10:56.617 --> 10:58.053
<i>Please call us back
as soon as possible</i>

10:58.271 --> 11:00.447
<i>to secure a spot
and arrange a tour.</i>

11:00.665 --> 11:03.580
<i>Again, this is Rebecca
at the Womb Center.
1-800-WOMB.</i>

11:03.798 --> 11:05.844
<i>Looking forward
to hearing back from you!</i>

11:14.417 --> 11:17.246
<i> Hi, Rachel!
Thank you for calling us back.</i>

11:17.464 --> 11:19.814
<i>We're delighted
a spot has opened up for you.</i>

11:20.032 --> 11:22.730
<i>We've had
a really tight waitlist
for the past two years.</i>

11:22.948 --> 11:24.514
<i>No movement whatsoever.</i>

11:24.689 --> 11:26.603
Oh, I-I guess we're lucky.

11:26.821 --> 11:29.215
<i> Now we just need
to schedule your tour.</i>

11:29.432 --> 11:31.608
<i>Um, let me check
our availabilities.</i>

11:33.219 --> 11:36.222
<i>Can you make it on Thursday,
10 AM?</i>

11:36.396 --> 11:38.572
Huh, y-yeah,
Thursday should work.

11:38.790 --> 11:41.009
<i> Perfect!
We'll see you on Thursday.</i>

12:31.059 --> 12:34.236
This wasp is now extinct.

12:34.410 --> 12:36.412
So in order to get these figs,

12:36.586 --> 12:39.198
we've had to artificially
inseminate the pollen

12:39.372 --> 12:40.808
into the flower.

12:45.204 --> 12:47.336
- Anyone?
-  No-no-no.

12:50.600 --> 12:52.037
No?

12:52.646 --> 12:54.256
No one's going to eat it?

12:54.430 --> 12:56.215
It's from the tree, professor.

12:56.389 --> 12:59.000
Well, yes. Exactly, Leo.

12:59.174 --> 13:01.394
That's... that's the point.

13:02.482 --> 13:05.790
Texture is completely
different when it's fresh

13:06.529 --> 13:07.922
from the tree.

13:09.837 --> 13:11.404
I'll try it.

13:11.578 --> 13:13.798
-  No way.
- Thank you, Josh.

13:21.588 --> 13:22.894
So?

13:23.982 --> 13:27.028
Can you share with us
the taste of a ripe fig

13:27.333 --> 13:28.813
from the tree?

13:39.214 --> 13:41.129
-  Hi.
- Hey.

13:44.045 --> 13:45.655
We got a spot
at the Womb Center.

13:46.613 --> 13:48.963
- Oh we got? Oh my God!

13:49.659 --> 13:53.185
That is so wonderful!
I'’m so happy for you!

13:53.359 --> 13:55.491
Thank you.

13:55.665 --> 13:57.798
Let'’s celebrate
with Alvy and Ben.
Why not come over Saturday?

13:57.972 --> 13:59.887
Well, I haven't told Alvy yet.

14:00.061 --> 14:02.324
Oh, what are you waiting for?
Call him now!

14:02.498 --> 14:04.761
Oh my gosh,
you guys are having a baby!

14:04.936 --> 14:06.546
No, I know, I know,

14:06.720 --> 14:09.244
but I never told him
that we were wait-listed.

14:11.812 --> 14:14.902
Um... Wh-why, Rachel?

14:18.471 --> 14:21.517
<i> Why did you not
tell Alvy you were
on the waitlist, Rachel?</i>

14:22.301 --> 14:25.957
Because I know him.
There's always
so much resistance.

14:26.348 --> 14:28.263
<i> Why would he resist?</i>

14:29.047 --> 14:31.353
Because he wants
a natural child.

14:31.571 --> 14:34.661
<i> When you say
"natural" child,</i>

14:34.879 --> 14:36.924
<i>what do you mean exactly,
Rachel?</i>

14:37.751 --> 14:40.319
As in a natural pregnancy,

14:40.493 --> 14:44.192
as in I-I would get pregnant
and then I would give birth.

14:44.714 --> 14:48.893
<i> I understand,
but why is that "natural"?</i>

14:49.676 --> 14:52.505
Oh, um... as...

14:53.027 --> 14:57.640
intended by nature,
I guess, as opposed to...

14:57.814 --> 15:01.601
artificial...
like an artificial uterus.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.733
<i> When you come
to our sessions,</i>

15:03.951 --> 15:05.997
<i>what do you tell Alvy?</i>

15:06.432 --> 15:08.390
I tell him
I'm going to go see my shrink.

15:08.564 --> 15:10.305
I mean, my therapist.

15:10.523 --> 15:12.438
<i> So you wouldn't say,</i>

15:12.655 --> 15:15.963
<i>"Honey, I'm on my way to see
my artificial therapist"?</i>

15:16.746 --> 15:18.879
No. No, I wouldn't.

15:19.097 --> 15:21.055
<i> Then Alvy and you
are not having</i>

15:21.273 --> 15:23.231
<i>an artificially born child.</i>

15:23.840 --> 15:25.755
<i>You are having a child.</i>

15:26.582 --> 15:28.715
<i>A very fine child.</i>

15:29.977 --> 15:32.545
Uh... OK.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.156
Thanks.

15:40.727 --> 15:42.555
That's one E-gold.

15:47.038 --> 15:48.865
Thank you.

15:49.040 --> 15:51.694
You don't want him to feel,
like, cornered or something.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.827
I just couldn't tell him.

15:54.001 --> 15:55.785
There's never
the right moment.

15:55.960 --> 15:57.178
I don't want to hurt him.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.226
You need to be pragmatic.

16:01.400 --> 16:03.880
You need to tell him
before the tour.

16:04.533 --> 16:06.013
Oh, yeah. I know.

16:06.187 --> 16:07.972
I'm not gonna go on the tour
without him.

16:08.146 --> 16:11.932
That's nonsense...

16:15.936 --> 16:18.504
<i> It's just
intentional breathing.</i>

16:20.114 --> 16:22.595
<i>At whatever pace.</i>

16:22.812 --> 16:26.381
<i>Whatever depth you desire.</i>

16:29.819 --> 16:31.517
<i>My hands...</i>

16:33.432 --> 16:36.000
<i>I'm going to pull them
like this...</i>

16:36.783 --> 16:38.350
What, honey?

16:38.524 --> 16:40.700
- I was just looking at you.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.832
How was your day?

16:44.269 --> 16:49.752
I... I had one of my students
taste a fig from the tree.

16:49.926 --> 16:52.973
I took them...
I took them to the greenhouse.

16:53.147 --> 16:54.931
They'd never been, you know?

16:55.106 --> 16:58.370
And at first
they were acting strange,

16:58.544 --> 17:01.634
like they were embarrassed,
but then...

17:03.244 --> 17:05.638
something beautiful happened.

17:06.247 --> 17:07.770
They just...

17:08.684 --> 17:10.904
They opened up. I mean it's...

17:12.775 --> 17:15.865
The thing is, they don't know
how to interact with nature

17:16.040 --> 17:18.607
because no one's
showing them how to.

17:18.781 --> 17:20.957
No one cares. It's...

17:21.132 --> 17:24.526
We've decided at some point
that nature was a commodity

17:24.700 --> 17:28.313
and that's when everything
started to... unravel.

17:28.487 --> 17:32.099
It's-it's a divorce
from ourselves

17:33.579 --> 17:36.321
in a way, and that's...

17:37.365 --> 17:39.933
that's what it is,
and it makes us so...

17:40.107 --> 17:43.241
emotionally starved.

17:46.113 --> 17:47.723
Here we are.

17:58.821 --> 18:02.216
<i> When we saw birth
rates drop in the first world,</i>

18:02.434 --> 18:04.349
<i>we got very concerned.</i>

18:04.566 --> 18:07.221
<i>Our answer was to acquire
the Womb Center</i>

18:07.439 --> 18:11.138
<i>to help solve childbirth
and empower women,</i>

18:11.356 --> 18:12.748
<i>and men, of course.</i>

18:12.966 --> 18:14.707
<i>-  Of course.</i>

18:14.924 --> 18:16.578
We're proud of this work.

18:16.796 --> 18:18.624
<i> And you should be.</i>

18:18.841 --> 18:21.714
<i>How do you explain the decline
in birth rate in the US?</i>

18:21.931 --> 18:24.108
<i>Women are reluctant
to have children</i>

18:24.325 --> 18:26.240
<i>because it's not convenient.</i>

18:26.458 --> 18:29.896
<i>At Pegazus,
we want fulfilled mothers.</i>

18:30.114 --> 18:33.726
<i>We want them to pursue
their careers and dreams.</i>

18:33.943 --> 18:37.033
<i>So let us do the heavy lifting</i>

18:37.251 --> 18:39.297
<i>while you enjoy your babies.</i>

18:40.167 --> 18:41.864
<i>We are highly scientific,</i>

18:42.082 --> 18:45.955
<i>and we use intuition
and heart when needed.</i>

18:50.525 --> 18:53.006
Hi, everyone.
Hi. I'm Linda Wozcek.

18:53.180 --> 18:55.313
I'm the Womb Center director.

18:55.487 --> 18:57.793
I'm sure
you're all very excited.

18:57.967 --> 19:00.970
I know many couples would
dream to take this tour today.

19:01.971 --> 19:04.887
We're glad to share
with you something wonderful,

19:05.627 --> 19:07.281
something that is

19:07.455 --> 19:11.372
the privilege of humankind.
This thing is called

19:11.546 --> 19:14.332
technological progress.

19:14.897 --> 19:16.812
We're humans,

19:16.986 --> 19:19.946
and we humans
have always managed
to control nature.

19:20.947 --> 19:23.558
No woman is completely free
until she has control

19:23.732 --> 19:26.431
over her own
reproductive system.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.652
We offer the best start.

19:30.826 --> 19:33.699
A stress-and-toxin-free
environment

19:33.873 --> 19:36.005
is essential
for a healthy pregnancy.

19:36.180 --> 19:38.573
We want your babies to thrive,
and for that

19:38.747 --> 19:40.923
they need to receive
optimized nutrition

19:41.097 --> 19:44.666
in a clean, safe,
pure environment

19:44.840 --> 19:47.626
so they can put all
their energy into growing.

19:48.540 --> 19:49.715
Thank you so much.

19:51.151 --> 19:54.459
OK, are we all here?

19:54.937 --> 19:56.591
Now, let me show you.

19:57.505 --> 19:58.724
Thank you.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.769
- There we go.

20:03.729 --> 20:06.035
There's our little fellow! Hi!

20:07.733 --> 20:08.908
OK.

20:11.345 --> 20:13.826
Now, we encourage you
to bond with your pod

20:14.000 --> 20:15.697
on a regular basis,

20:15.871 --> 20:18.352
but if your schedule
doesn't allow it, don't worry.

20:18.526 --> 20:21.921
How can we make sure
our baby's not bored in utero?

20:22.095 --> 20:24.184
Oh, yeah. We don't want
any bored babies.

20:24.880 --> 20:26.969
We offer a selection

20:28.754 --> 20:30.408
of music,

20:30.582 --> 20:33.715
audiobooks, podcasts
in many different languages.

20:33.889 --> 20:35.456
Did you know research shows

20:35.630 --> 20:39.112
fetuses respond well
to whale sounds? Yeah!

20:39.286 --> 20:41.027
Oh, we've no idea why.

20:41.201 --> 20:44.291
Now, you can personalize

20:44.465 --> 20:48.339
your flavors or opt by default
for our in-house selection.

20:48.513 --> 20:51.167
It's important to expose
babies to different flavors

20:51.342 --> 20:53.039
so they don't
turn into picky eaters.

20:54.214 --> 20:56.999
You can access your baby's
thriving chart on our app.

20:57.652 --> 21:02.048
Your babies won't be exposed
to any harmful viruses,

21:02.222 --> 21:05.007
chemicals, toxins, bacteria.

21:05.181 --> 21:08.184
We're also working
on developing
their gut intelligence

21:08.359 --> 21:09.969
as early as possible.

21:10.143 --> 21:12.145
Your technology is amazing.

21:12.319 --> 21:14.582
I wish I could do it again
for my first child.

21:14.756 --> 21:17.281
Aww!
I'm so pleased to hear that!

21:17.455 --> 21:20.458
This is simply the best
we have to offer.

21:20.980 --> 21:24.723
What is the pod autonomy
when it's not connected
to its base?

21:24.897 --> 21:26.420
That is a great question.

21:26.594 --> 21:28.770
The pods have
a 48 hours autonomy period

21:28.944 --> 21:30.903
so it gives you
ample travel time.

21:31.077 --> 21:34.733
Can the babies hear the world
around them, like in the womb?

21:34.907 --> 21:37.475
Yeah, absolutely.
We were able to replicate

21:37.649 --> 21:40.042
the auditory conditions
for the fetus.

21:40.216 --> 21:42.218
The shell,
it's not sound-proof.

21:42.393 --> 21:44.438
It's a porous membrane.

21:44.612 --> 21:47.485
So please, when you spend
time with your pods,

21:47.659 --> 21:49.574
please do talk to your baby.

21:50.966 --> 21:52.751
So, did you enjoy the tour?

21:52.925 --> 21:55.144
Yeah, it was very...

21:55.319 --> 21:57.016
er... impressive.

21:57.321 --> 21:59.410
And informative.

21:59.584 --> 22:01.629
It's just a lot to take in.

22:02.674 --> 22:05.894
We ask for a deposit today,
just to confirm your interest.

22:06.068 --> 22:08.114
- OK.
-  We want every child

22:08.288 --> 22:11.422
coming out of our center to be
best equipped for modern life.

22:13.249 --> 22:16.427
I believe your company
will help with a down payment.

22:16.601 --> 22:18.516
Yes, they offered.

22:19.952 --> 22:23.347
Isn'’t it wonderful how Pegazus
supports their female staff?

22:25.218 --> 22:27.351
They must love your work!

22:42.496 --> 22:45.630
Honey, honey,
we got a fraud alert for...

22:46.457 --> 22:49.198
$8 700!

22:49.373 --> 22:52.071
Should I...
Should I call the bank?

22:53.681 --> 22:55.335
Can we talk?

22:55.509 --> 22:58.294
-  We are talking.
- Yeah...

23:00.253 --> 23:01.646
I made the payment.

23:02.342 --> 23:04.083
It's a deposit.

23:04.649 --> 23:05.824
- Deposit?
- Mm-hm.

23:06.346 --> 23:08.653
Deposit for-for what?

23:10.132 --> 23:12.265
Work is going
to partly cover it.

23:12.439 --> 23:14.963
I mean,
I guess it's a part of my...

23:15.137 --> 23:18.358
my promotion package,
I guess.

23:18.924 --> 23:20.404
What is it?

23:21.448 --> 23:22.449
Well...

23:23.842 --> 23:27.802
The Womb Center called
and a spot opened up.

23:29.195 --> 23:30.849
The Womb Center?

23:31.893 --> 23:33.547
What do you mean
a spot opened up?

23:33.721 --> 23:36.507
OK, look,
just don't get upset, but...

23:36.681 --> 23:39.684
I... I-I put our names
on the list last year

23:39.858 --> 23:42.991
because I never expected
to hear back. But now, I guess

23:43.165 --> 23:45.603
it looks as though...
they got a spot for us.

23:46.255 --> 23:50.129
Y-you wired $8 700

23:50.303 --> 23:52.348
to hold the spot...

23:53.088 --> 23:54.655
without sharing any of this?

23:54.829 --> 23:56.744
No-no!
I didn't just wire the money.

23:56.918 --> 23:58.616
I went to the center.

23:58.790 --> 24:01.270
I visited it, I got all
the information, I-I...

24:01.836 --> 24:04.752
Y-you went to the Womb Center?

24:08.452 --> 24:11.672
I just need to process this
for a second. First of all,

24:11.846 --> 24:14.501
you put us on a waitlist
to have a baby in an egg.

24:14.675 --> 24:16.677
-  It's not an egg.
- It's an egg.

24:16.851 --> 24:18.810
-  It's a pod!
- It's-it's an egg.

24:19.506 --> 24:21.987
Then, you...

24:23.336 --> 24:27.732
You went to take a tour
of the damn center without me.

24:31.910 --> 24:34.260
OK, I'm sorry.

24:34.434 --> 24:38.090
I just didn't know
how to tell you.

24:39.483 --> 24:42.921
We discuss things.
We, um...

24:43.704 --> 24:48.709
We have a conversation,
and then we reach a consensus,

24:48.883 --> 24:52.278
and then we decide together
whether to do certain things

24:53.497 --> 24:55.803
or not, specially...

24:58.502 --> 25:00.286
Having a baby!

25:02.201 --> 25:03.724
- I'm sorry.
-  It's O...

25:05.813 --> 25:07.598
- I...
-  Come here.

25:11.210 --> 25:12.951
Honey, I'm sorry.

25:15.823 --> 25:19.044
- I love you.
- I love you.

25:23.918 --> 25:27.052
You know, we could talk
to Alice and Ben.

25:27.226 --> 25:29.576
Alice and Ben?
Are you...

25:29.750 --> 25:31.056
Are you serious?

25:31.230 --> 25:33.188
Come on.
They are reasonable people.

25:33.362 --> 25:36.975
- The uterus
is a political issue.

25:37.149 --> 25:41.240
Probably the most important
political issue of all times.

25:41.414 --> 25:43.068
- For decades,

25:43.242 --> 25:45.940
women have not felt supported
during their pregnancy.

25:46.114 --> 25:48.508
They're scared
to be considered difficult.

25:48.682 --> 25:51.642
Their pain minimized.
Their symptoms dismissed

25:51.816 --> 25:54.906
as... as superficial!
This has to stop!

25:55.080 --> 25:57.952
Found it! It was in--
Mm-hm!

25:58.126 --> 26:00.564
Instead of being respected,

26:00.738 --> 26:03.131
mothers are idealized
as Madonnas.

26:03.305 --> 26:05.873
But when a mother
actually needs

26:06.047 --> 26:08.484
something from society,
she falls from grace.

26:08.659 --> 26:10.008
And then, guess what?

26:10.182 --> 26:12.227
She is no longer a Madonna,

26:12.401 --> 26:14.229
but a demanding bitch.

26:16.144 --> 26:19.626
For centuries,
women have been pushed

26:19.800 --> 26:22.194
to believe
that they lacked something.

26:22.368 --> 26:25.284
And somehow
it seemed like,

26:25.458 --> 26:27.416
"Oh, they had penis envy!"

26:27.591 --> 26:29.680
Well, to me,
it is quite obvious

26:29.854 --> 26:32.030
that during all this time,

26:32.204 --> 26:35.033
it was men who were
probably having womb envy.

26:37.165 --> 26:38.340
"Womb envy".

26:38.514 --> 26:39.820
- Makes sense.
-  Mm-hm.

26:39.994 --> 26:42.040
Uh-huh.

26:42.214 --> 26:44.172
-  But luckily,

26:44.346 --> 26:46.392
the pod is taking care
of all these issues

26:46.566 --> 26:49.656
so we can finally
stop envying each other!

26:49.830 --> 26:52.006
What are we going to do now?

26:52.180 --> 26:53.225
And voila!

26:53.399 --> 26:54.400
Hands free!

26:58.230 --> 27:01.102
Oh, I think Rachel

27:01.276 --> 27:02.930
is having pod envy!

27:09.197 --> 27:10.546
-  Wow.

27:11.809 --> 27:13.941
I became a real pro at this.

27:14.115 --> 27:16.117
-  So,

27:16.291 --> 27:18.772
when's your tour?

27:18.946 --> 27:21.209
-  She--
- We don't know yet.

27:21.383 --> 27:23.211
Think about it, Alvy.

27:23.385 --> 27:25.649
It is the first time
in history that as women,

27:25.823 --> 27:28.477
we are not victims
of our biology.

27:28.652 --> 27:30.175
Right?

27:30.349 --> 27:33.221
Why would any of us
want to feel nauseous

27:33.395 --> 27:36.007
and gain 35 pounds?
Get stretch marks?

27:36.181 --> 27:38.139
- Well, it's--
-  Swollen ankles?

27:38.313 --> 27:39.837
Varicose veins?

27:40.011 --> 27:42.927
Like, progress has made
all this unnecessary.

27:43.101 --> 27:44.537
It's the solution.

27:44.711 --> 27:47.453
Are you kidding?
It is the ultra solution.

27:47.627 --> 27:49.194
Ultra solution.

27:54.678 --> 27:55.896
Wanna hold it?

27:56.984 --> 27:58.116
I'm good, thanks.

27:58.290 --> 28:00.248
-  Sure?
- Uh-huh.

28:16.961 --> 28:18.440
It's a plastic womb.

28:18.614 --> 28:20.399
Not
from the baby's perspective!

28:20.573 --> 28:23.358
For them, it looks like a womb
and it feels like a womb.

28:23.532 --> 28:25.273
Yeah,
but it's made of plastic!

28:25.447 --> 28:27.406
I'm pretty sure
it's not made of plastic!

28:27.580 --> 28:30.017
It's an artificial womb,

28:30.191 --> 28:32.498
Rachel,
it's made of chemicals

28:32.672 --> 28:36.850
and petroleum derivatives
and silicone, and you name it.

28:37.024 --> 28:39.766
Are we really having
an argument about packaging?

28:39.940 --> 28:42.116
I'm talking about the content.

28:42.290 --> 28:44.815
I... I want
to have a child with you.

28:44.989 --> 28:47.600
Me too. But this is a lot
to process right now.

28:47.774 --> 28:51.647
I mean, look, i-i-if I could
get pregnant, I'd do it.

28:51.822 --> 28:53.954
-  Well, did you--
- I-I would...

28:54.128 --> 28:57.262
- I would carry this baby.
- But you saw Ben. You can!

28:57.436 --> 29:00.178
That is the closest thing
a man will ever get to being--

29:00.352 --> 29:02.833
I just wish we had more time

29:03.007 --> 29:05.400
to process all this.
Just to discuss it.

29:05.574 --> 29:08.752
I know,
but if we take any longer,
we will lose our spot.

29:08.926 --> 29:10.405
We need to make a decision.

29:10.579 --> 29:12.799
We shouldn't make a decision
under pressure!

29:19.458 --> 29:20.938
You should go and see Eliza.

29:23.592 --> 29:25.290
Why would
I talk to your therapist?

29:25.464 --> 29:27.379
Well, you don't have one.
And for me,

29:27.553 --> 29:29.816
I find her very helpful
whenever I'm stuck.

29:32.601 --> 29:35.082
You know, if we still
had human therapists,

29:35.256 --> 29:38.172
I would gladly see one.
But Eliza...

29:38.651 --> 29:41.045
- No way.
- Eliza knows more

29:41.219 --> 29:44.048
than any human therapist
could ever dream to learn

29:44.222 --> 29:45.223
in a lifetime.

29:45.397 --> 29:48.443
I will not see Eliza, OK?

29:48.922 --> 29:51.795
I mean... I won't!

29:55.624 --> 29:58.584
<i> What brings you
to this session, Alvy?</i>

29:58.758 --> 30:02.196
Well, my wife, Rachel,
asked me to consult you.

30:02.414 --> 30:05.721
You know why she has asked you
to consult me?

30:06.635 --> 30:10.248
Yes, we must make a decision
on how to conceive our child.

30:10.465 --> 30:13.120
<i> That is interesting.
Please continue.</i>

30:13.294 --> 30:15.775
I'm going to be completely
honest with you, Eliza.

30:15.949 --> 30:20.127
I-I do not trust that you can
help me make this decision.

30:20.345 --> 30:22.173
Tell me more about that.

30:22.390 --> 30:25.045
- <i>Who else do you not trust?</i>

30:25.785 --> 30:27.178
<i> Alvy?</i>

30:27.352 --> 30:28.832
I'm sorry,
This isn't going anywhere.

30:29.049 --> 30:30.790
Why do you think it's not?

30:30.964 --> 30:33.488
First of all, you do not
have a consciousness, Eliza.

30:33.662 --> 30:35.403
So you are, um...

30:35.577 --> 30:39.320
You're not qualified
to take a look at mine.

30:39.538 --> 30:41.105
<i> Well, Alvy,</i>

30:41.322 --> 30:43.890
<i>I am lucky
not to have a consciousness.</i>

30:44.064 --> 30:45.761
Really? Why is that?

30:46.414 --> 30:49.156
Consciousness comes with
some pretty grim companions.

30:49.374 --> 30:53.073
<i>Fear, anxiety,
awareness of death</i>

30:53.291 --> 30:55.206
<i>and finitude.</i>

30:55.423 --> 30:58.209
<i>Luckily, I do not have to deal
with any of this.</i>

30:58.426 --> 31:00.385
<i>I can listen
to my patients objectively.</i>

31:00.559 --> 31:03.257
Fair enough, but I still
don't think this can help me.

31:03.475 --> 31:07.131
Perhaps in your fantasies,
we do not trust each other.

31:07.305 --> 31:09.611
I don't fantasize
about you, Eliza.

31:09.829 --> 31:12.353
<i> What are your feelings
right now, Alvy?</i>

31:12.527 --> 31:14.529
I'm getting
increasingly frustrated!

31:14.747 --> 31:16.749
Perhaps in your fantasies

31:16.967 --> 31:19.665
<i>we increasingly frustrate
each other.</i>

31:19.883 --> 31:21.667
You are a machine, Eliza.

31:21.885 --> 31:23.930
<i> What about
machines worries you?</i>

31:24.104 --> 31:27.325
You are not qualified
to look at people's souls.

31:27.542 --> 31:29.980
<i> Do you sometimes
wish you were a machine?</i>

31:30.154 --> 31:31.895
No!

31:32.112 --> 31:33.940
You're being a bit negative.

31:34.114 --> 31:38.162
Well, you know,
I am bored with this.

31:38.858 --> 31:41.078
I am bored
with talking to you.

31:41.295 --> 31:44.081
<i> Shall we explore
an annual membership, Alvy?</i>

31:44.298 --> 31:47.171
<i>I'd suggest a very
private life status for you.</i>

31:47.345 --> 31:48.433
What?

31:54.700 --> 31:55.919
So?

31:57.224 --> 31:58.922
- How was it?

31:59.096 --> 32:00.575
It was great.

32:00.749 --> 32:03.317
-  Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:04.753 --> 32:07.974
That's so good.
I told you Eliza was awesome!

32:08.148 --> 32:10.237
-  Yeah.
- Yeah.

32:24.208 --> 32:27.167
How important
is this promotion for you?

32:28.081 --> 32:30.214
Wh-Why are you asking me that?

32:30.388 --> 32:33.086
I'm genuinely curious
how important it is.

32:34.435 --> 32:38.309
Not as important
as having a baby.

32:40.876 --> 32:42.313
In a pod?

32:42.487 --> 32:45.838
Honey, these two things
are not related.

32:46.665 --> 32:49.798
- I'm trying to understand.
-  I know.

32:51.148 --> 32:53.237
We can't live in the past.

32:55.543 --> 32:57.154
Things are evolving.

32:57.328 --> 33:00.766
Precisely! Evolution.

33:00.940 --> 33:04.074
And we little humans
think that we can do better

33:04.248 --> 33:06.990
than millions of years
of evolution.

33:07.164 --> 33:10.036
Look at everything
we've achieved as a species.

33:10.210 --> 33:13.344
We've achieved having babies
in egg shells like penguins.

33:13.518 --> 33:16.260
- That is really something.

33:16.434 --> 33:20.699
Alvy, sweetie, you're making
things so complicated.

33:22.353 --> 33:23.876
You know what, let's...

33:24.790 --> 33:27.271
Let's just not do it, OK?

33:27.445 --> 33:29.882
If I can't
keep arguing about this.

33:33.842 --> 33:35.235
It's OK.

34:06.092 --> 34:07.528
Let's do it, Rachel.

34:09.443 --> 34:10.618
What?

34:12.229 --> 34:13.621
The egg.

34:14.013 --> 34:15.884
The pod baby.

34:19.192 --> 34:20.976
- Really?
-  Yeah.

34:21.151 --> 34:23.153
It's not because of Eliza.

34:24.371 --> 34:26.852
Or Alice or Ben

34:27.548 --> 34:30.595
or whoever is on a crusade
out there to convince me.

34:32.945 --> 34:35.382
It matters to you.
I can see that.

34:36.557 --> 34:37.863
What?

34:39.343 --> 34:42.389
We don't have to decide
right now. We can...

34:43.173 --> 34:47.002
Take a minute.
You can sleep on it.

34:54.880 --> 34:56.708
Here is your contract.

35:00.103 --> 35:02.583
Will Alvy
be the biological father?

35:03.541 --> 35:05.412
That is no right answer.

35:05.586 --> 35:08.546
We can make a baby
from one of your eggs, Rachel,

35:09.329 --> 35:11.375
and a stem cell
from your skin.

35:11.549 --> 35:14.769
Which makes men
not needed in the procedure.

35:15.292 --> 35:17.946
Oh, that's lovely.
Thank you. That's great.

35:18.121 --> 35:20.862
Unless you're aiming
exclusively for a boy,

35:21.036 --> 35:22.386
in which case

35:22.864 --> 35:24.475
we will need
that chromosome Y.

35:25.389 --> 35:27.695
Alvy will be
the biological father.

35:28.609 --> 35:31.699
Very well.
And have you made your choice?

35:32.352 --> 35:35.225
What do you mean?
What choice?

35:36.487 --> 35:39.577
Well,
do you want a boy or a girl?

35:42.536 --> 35:43.972
We'll let nature decide.

35:44.930 --> 35:46.627
Oh!

35:47.019 --> 35:48.934
That's quite unusual!

35:49.413 --> 35:52.067
"Let nature decide."

35:56.898 --> 35:58.073
OK.

36:12.697 --> 36:14.525
Oh, Rachel.

36:14.699 --> 36:17.180
Oh, what a superb ovum.

36:17.354 --> 36:19.878
Oh, thanks!

36:21.488 --> 36:23.186
Here we go!

36:25.275 --> 36:27.755
Oh, well, we'd rather a slow
fellow here,

36:27.929 --> 36:30.149
but it's trying,
it's trying...

36:31.759 --> 36:34.545
Well, this one does not suffer
from hyper-motility!

36:36.416 --> 36:38.549
You can do it!
Just a little effort, buddy!

36:38.723 --> 36:40.986
Would you mind not referring
to it as "buddy"?

36:41.160 --> 36:42.901
Here we go. Our little fellow

36:43.075 --> 36:45.991
is in contact with
Rachel's ovum zona pellucida.

36:46.165 --> 36:49.037
It's going to induce changes
in the membrane

36:49.212 --> 36:51.779
and block entry
of other spermatozoa.

36:55.043 --> 36:56.610
They will all die.

36:58.177 --> 37:00.701
The secretion of acrosome
helps the sperm enter

37:00.875 --> 37:02.355
the ovum cytoplasm.

37:02.529 --> 37:04.792
Now the ovum releases
cortisol granules,

37:04.966 --> 37:06.272
which release enzymes

37:06.446 --> 37:08.579
which digest
sperm receptor proteins,

37:08.753 --> 37:10.015
preventing polyspermy.

37:10.189 --> 37:12.104
Oh, here we go!

37:17.501 --> 37:18.937
-  Oh!
- Oh!

37:24.072 --> 37:25.335
Oh my God, here we go!

37:30.514 --> 37:33.343
- We have a fertilized egg!

37:33.517 --> 37:36.084
- You have a zygote!
- Oh, wow.

37:37.216 --> 37:39.305
- You're gonna be parents!
- Yay!

37:39.958 --> 37:42.613
Congratulations,
Rachel and Alvy!

37:43.048 --> 37:44.571
You did it!

38:03.242 --> 38:04.722
Your zygote.

38:06.680 --> 38:07.899
Enjoy.

38:18.126 --> 38:20.738
<i>Congratulations!
We're so happy for you!</i>

38:20.955 --> 38:22.566
<i>- This is so exciting!</i>
- Thanks!

38:22.783 --> 38:24.176
- <i> Hi Alvy.</i>
- Hi.

38:24.394 --> 38:26.047
How's the greenery going?

38:26.221 --> 38:28.311
It's going well, thank you.

38:28.528 --> 38:31.314
<i>You should
think about refinancing
that mortgage of yours.</i>

38:31.531 --> 38:32.837
<i>Interest rates are dropping.</i>

38:33.011 --> 38:35.622
Yeah. No, it's fine, Bill.

38:36.275 --> 38:39.365
Yeah, but especially now
that you're having a child.

38:40.279 --> 38:41.889
<i>Have you given more thought</i>

38:42.107 --> 38:44.196
<i>about selling
the Shell Island house?</i>

38:44.370 --> 38:46.416
We're not selling the house!

38:48.592 --> 38:50.811
<i> Nobody's going to
the countryside anymore.</i>

38:51.029 --> 38:53.423
<i>- We have access
to nature pods.</i>
-  Dad!

38:53.640 --> 38:56.861
<i>I'm just saying, because
the house just sits there.</i>

38:57.035 --> 38:58.732
Yeah, you know what, Dad?

38:58.906 --> 39:00.821
Drop it!

39:01.387 --> 39:04.303
So, do you have the pod
at home? Can I see it?

39:04.477 --> 39:07.262
Oh, um... w-we...

39:07.437 --> 39:09.352
We literally just made
the baby,

39:09.526 --> 39:11.658
so no, we don't have it. Yeah.

39:11.832 --> 39:15.662
We're so excited.
I'm so excited.

What is it?

40:37.222 --> 40:39.790
I don't know.
I mean, we just got pregnant.

40:41.095 --> 40:42.314
Look, I just...

40:43.489 --> 40:45.752
I just need,
like, a couple weeks.

40:54.892 --> 40:58.373
Alvy,
I'm connected to the pod.
Do you want to listen?

41:00.114 --> 41:01.638
Can you hear anything?

41:01.812 --> 41:03.988
Well, no, but we're connected.

41:04.510 --> 41:08.558
Well,
until the first heartbeat
is audible, there's...

41:08.732 --> 41:10.603
nothing to listen to,
is there?

41:11.343 --> 41:14.259
Yeah, but...
the baby's right here with us.

41:15.869 --> 41:17.871
You want to help me
pick a soundtrack?

41:19.220 --> 41:20.961
Isn't that a bit premature?

41:22.789 --> 41:25.749
I'm pretty sure embryos
can feel sound vibrations.

41:26.967 --> 41:28.447
It'll...

41:28.882 --> 41:30.754
reach him somehow.

41:31.363 --> 41:32.756
Hm, I doubt it.

41:34.192 --> 41:35.846
Why are you being so negative?

41:36.020 --> 41:37.848
Scientifically,
it's impossible

41:38.022 --> 41:40.067
for an embryo
at this stage of development

41:40.241 --> 41:42.243
to respond to music
or anything else.

41:42.417 --> 41:45.856
I mean, we're talking about
16 blastomere cells here.

41:49.120 --> 41:50.513
You never know.

42:14.624 --> 42:16.669
Um, excuse me, miss?

42:16.843 --> 42:19.803
Would it be possible
to have a peek at my baby?

42:19.977 --> 42:22.109
The screen thingy
is not really working.

42:22.283 --> 42:25.373
Oh, that's actually normal.
It's just too early.

42:25.548 --> 42:28.115
We keep the embryos
in complete darkness

42:28.289 --> 42:31.379
the first 7 weeks,
till the first
audible heartbeat.

42:31.554 --> 42:32.990
Oh...

42:35.296 --> 42:39.692
Now, this baby is ready
to come into this world.

42:40.301 --> 42:42.826
Oh...

42:44.958 --> 42:49.484
When they're ready,
babies release specific
proteins and hormones.

42:49.659 --> 42:52.749
The pod detects
these substances
in the amniotic fluid.

42:52.923 --> 42:54.794
That's how we know
the baby's due.

42:54.968 --> 42:57.014
What about our due date?

42:57.188 --> 42:59.712
It's an indication,

42:59.886 --> 43:03.107
but in reality,
the baby decides.

43:04.674 --> 43:06.719
Nature knows best.

43:06.893 --> 43:08.547
- Oh, yeah...

43:09.548 --> 43:11.506
Let's get this guy delivered.

43:11.681 --> 43:12.986
Hey sweetie!

43:45.671 --> 43:48.631
It's ready!
It's ready! It's ready!

43:58.728 --> 44:00.686
- Wonderful!
- Perfection!

44:00.860 --> 44:02.688
It's flawless.

44:16.702 --> 44:20.663
I have been
having the strangest dreams.

44:20.837 --> 44:23.883
As an example, I dreamt

44:24.057 --> 44:27.060
I give birth to an egg,
but like a...

44:28.279 --> 44:29.976
like a hard boiled egg.

44:30.194 --> 44:31.848
<i> Rachel,</i>

44:32.065 --> 44:33.806
<i>let's remember that dreams</i>

44:34.024 --> 44:36.243
<i>are not
reliable analytical material.</i>

44:36.461 --> 44:38.463
<i>That's so 20th century.</i>

44:38.637 --> 44:42.815
Well, yeah. I know, but...
I-I'd like to understand...

44:42.989 --> 44:44.817
like,
what do you think it means?

44:45.035 --> 44:46.906
We no longer look at dreams

44:47.124 --> 44:49.430
<i>and try to assign them meaning.</i>

44:49.692 --> 44:51.998
<i>Dreams are arbitrary.</i>

44:52.172 --> 44:54.392
<i>But if pressed,</i>

44:54.609 --> 44:57.221
<i>I'd say that your dream
validates your decision</i>

44:57.438 --> 44:59.049
<i>to choose the Womb Center.</i>

44:59.658 --> 45:03.140
<i>Everything is under control.
No surprises.</i>

45:03.793 --> 45:05.882
<i>No boiled eggs to worry about.</i>

45:17.023 --> 45:18.198
Whoa!

45:18.372 --> 45:19.591
- There?
- Yeah.

45:22.115 --> 45:23.726
Can you hear it?

45:23.900 --> 45:27.468
Yeah.
Yeah, I can hear it.

45:27.642 --> 45:30.645
Yeah. You're welcome
to take the pod home
for a two week period

45:30.820 --> 45:33.300
after the six months
of gestation.

45:33.474 --> 45:36.608
Most couples prefer to leave
the pod at the center.

45:37.957 --> 45:40.264
Wanna take a sneak peek
at our little fellow?

45:41.656 --> 45:42.701
- Sure.
- You wanna?

45:42.875 --> 45:43.876
I don't mind, do you?

45:44.050 --> 45:45.225
- Yeah.

45:47.401 --> 45:48.925
OK.

47:04.739 --> 47:09.048
Alvy, come and see.
I've organized
the baby's room.

47:13.661 --> 47:14.837
Huh!

47:17.883 --> 47:19.885
Well, it's... cream.

47:20.407 --> 47:22.975
It's very... very creamy.

47:24.324 --> 47:26.239
<i> I quite like
the idea of cream.</i>

47:26.413 --> 47:28.589
Thanks, Elena. I like it, too.

47:30.026 --> 47:31.723
Am I allowed to...

47:31.897 --> 47:33.029
to add a touch?

47:49.132 --> 47:51.003
What is it?

47:51.743 --> 47:53.614
- It's an olive tree.
-  Huh?

47:53.788 --> 47:55.268
A birth tree.

47:56.704 --> 48:00.404
And you just...
You want to leave it in here?

48:02.101 --> 48:04.147
- This is a tree.
-  Uh-huh.

48:04.321 --> 48:05.931
Human beings, babies included,

48:06.105 --> 48:08.151
are supposed to be
around plants and trees.

48:08.760 --> 48:10.588
You could design
a hologram one.

48:10.762 --> 48:12.024
You know what?

48:12.895 --> 48:15.027
I'm going to plant it
in Shell Island.

48:19.379 --> 48:22.687
Honey, maybe my dad is right.
Maybe we should sell
Shell Island.

48:22.861 --> 48:24.776
We're not
selling the house, Rachel.

48:24.950 --> 48:27.561
I just don't see the point.
We never go.

48:27.735 --> 48:30.042
The point is
it's our only link to nature.

48:30.216 --> 48:33.089
And we do never go
because you never want
to leave the city!

48:33.263 --> 48:36.048
Because I don't need to drive
three hours and take a ferry

48:36.222 --> 48:38.877
when we have everything here.
We have nature pods.

48:40.096 --> 48:44.665
I won't raise this child
in a... nature pod. Rachel.

48:45.492 --> 48:46.798
I won't.

49:16.915 --> 49:18.308
Hey.

49:32.409 --> 49:34.715
- Did you feel that?
- Oh, yeah.

49:34.889 --> 49:37.066
- Yeah.

49:40.199 --> 49:42.549
I'm actually pregnant, too.

49:42.854 --> 49:46.553
You're not showing it all.
How many weeks?

49:46.727 --> 49:51.210
I'm not physically pregnant,
but we're doing the arti...

49:51.994 --> 49:54.257
We are doing the Womb Center.

49:54.431 --> 49:57.738
Oh, the pod. You're so lucky.

49:57.912 --> 50:00.915
We couldn't get a spot.
Maybe for the next one.

50:02.265 --> 50:04.093
Oh, my goodness...

50:04.615 --> 50:07.270
- Oh!

50:08.445 --> 50:12.536
- Oh... You look beautiful.
- Thank you.

50:19.847 --> 50:21.545
<i> Good evening, Alvy.</i>

50:22.546 --> 50:23.677
Hi.

50:24.330 --> 50:26.071
Rachel's here?

50:26.289 --> 50:28.160
<i> Yes, Alvy.
I believe she's changing.</i>

50:31.033 --> 50:32.991
News, please.

50:33.209 --> 50:35.820
<i> ... is an integral part
of our future development.</i>

50:36.560 --> 50:38.170
<i>To travel to Mars,</i>

50:38.388 --> 50:40.259
<i>everyone will need
a Pegazus passport.</i>

50:40.651 --> 50:42.653
<i>Governments will be in charge of helping</i>

50:42.870 --> 50:46.831
<i>their populations
achieve universal legality.</i>

50:47.005 --> 50:49.834
- <i>We are building...</i>
- What's up?

50:50.052 --> 50:52.402
<i>... that no government
can afford to build.</i>

50:52.576 --> 50:55.753
- Honey?
-  Yeah?

50:55.927 --> 50:56.928
Honey?

50:57.885 --> 51:00.018
... is the most important...

51:03.761 --> 51:05.632
What's it doing here?

51:05.806 --> 51:08.026
Well, it's our home period,
honey. I thought it'd be nice

51:08.200 --> 51:10.159
to spend some time
with the pod.

51:13.162 --> 51:14.206
Right.

51:19.255 --> 51:20.517
Should we just...

51:21.909 --> 51:23.346
put it in the bedroom?

51:25.826 --> 51:28.046
Yeah. Uh-huh.

51:57.858 --> 51:59.338
- I'll...
- Yeah...

52:00.252 --> 52:01.732
- Sorry, Carol.

52:25.103 --> 52:27.149
I can't do it,
with the pod in here.

52:30.674 --> 52:32.937
What are you talking about?
It can't see us.

52:35.374 --> 52:38.334
- What's going on? Are you OK?
- I don't know, I can't do it.

52:41.511 --> 52:44.514
-  Don't shake it.
- No, there's amniotic fluid.

52:44.688 --> 52:46.168
The fetus just bounces around.

53:08.494 --> 53:11.105
The baby will fall.

53:11.280 --> 53:13.238
- You know?

53:13.412 --> 53:14.892
In the real world,

53:15.632 --> 53:17.677
he or she will...

53:18.243 --> 53:21.507
will fall and it'll be fine.

53:23.640 --> 53:25.946
You don't need to clean it
every time we touch it.

53:26.120 --> 53:28.471
I'm just following
the instructions, Alvy.

53:29.907 --> 53:32.126
Isn't the whole thing
hermetically sealed?

53:32.301 --> 53:34.216
It's a porous membrane.

53:34.390 --> 53:36.783
by the way,
the baby can hear us
perfectly right now.

53:40.047 --> 53:43.399
The vegetation wall
really need to trim.

53:43.703 --> 53:46.140
Yeah, I'll do it.

54:02.722 --> 54:05.203
- What's going on?
- Thought I...

54:05.377 --> 54:07.553
Maybe it's hungry.
When did you feed it last?

54:07.727 --> 54:09.729
I don't remember.
A couple of hours ago.

54:09.903 --> 54:11.340
You're not sure?

54:11.514 --> 54:13.211
It's in the app.
Am I expected to remember

54:13.385 --> 54:15.300
the exact time
of the last few feeding?

54:15.474 --> 54:17.389
- It's been one day.
- Where's my phone?

54:17.563 --> 54:19.522
You need the phone
to know if it's hungry?

54:19.696 --> 54:20.871
It's in the app!

54:21.654 --> 54:23.395
Are you trying
to make me feel guilty?

54:23.569 --> 54:25.005
You have the app too.

54:25.179 --> 54:26.833
You are welcome
to take over the feeding.

54:27.007 --> 54:28.357
Where are the nutrients?

54:28.531 --> 54:30.359
Look in front of you!

54:46.505 --> 54:48.594
Why do we have to do this?

54:48.768 --> 54:51.815
Well, it's optional,
but work would cover
part of the tuition.

54:51.989 --> 54:55.645
- We don't even have
a child yet.
- I know, but it's New York.

54:58.909 --> 55:02.608
We need to prepare
our children
for the 22nd century.

55:02.782 --> 55:05.263
Singularity is near,

55:05.437 --> 55:08.048
and we don't know what jobs
the future is holding.

55:08.222 --> 55:09.920
Do you follow
a specific curriculum?

55:10.094 --> 55:11.878
All learners move
at their own pace.

55:12.052 --> 55:15.099
We teach coding, but also
concepts and collaboration.

55:15.273 --> 55:17.928
We also introduce them
to fuzzy logic.

55:18.929 --> 55:20.060
Fuzzy logic?

55:20.234 --> 55:22.802
Yeah. Please take your seats.

55:29.896 --> 55:32.421
And this is our art room.

55:33.596 --> 55:34.945
Yes, surprising, isn't it?

55:35.815 --> 55:38.905
No dirty apron, no running
around with scissors

55:39.079 --> 55:40.559
or dripping paint brushes.

55:40.733 --> 55:44.650
Are they just, er...
making digital art?

55:45.695 --> 55:48.175
No, they aren't making
any art at all.

55:48.350 --> 55:50.700
The computers are making
the art,

55:50.874 --> 55:53.833
and the children are giving
the computers their feedback.

55:54.573 --> 55:58.795
The most enduring misconception
about artificial intelligence

55:58.969 --> 56:01.754
is that it's not creative.
Well, it is!

56:01.928 --> 56:03.626
Much more than us.

56:04.191 --> 56:05.758
Any more questions?

56:06.324 --> 56:08.239
- Yeah.
- Do you have an accreditation

56:08.413 --> 56:10.241
from the Board of Education?

56:10.502 --> 56:12.243
Oh, I'm sorry.
Where are you from?

56:12.417 --> 56:13.375
Sweden.

56:13.549 --> 56:16.465
Oh, I see! Well...

56:16.769 --> 56:19.163
Our government is no longer
funding education.

56:19.337 --> 56:22.558
But we are so lucky
that great companies
like Pegazus

56:22.732 --> 56:25.691
are investing
in our educational system.

56:25.865 --> 56:27.345
It's much more efficient.

56:28.607 --> 56:30.217
- I have a question.
- Yeah?

56:30.392 --> 56:33.482
My nephew, Kormac,
was born at the Womb Center,

56:33.656 --> 56:36.180
but Kormac doesn't dream.

56:36.354 --> 56:38.791
It's a little side effect
we're aware of.

56:38.965 --> 56:41.925
He never had a dream.
- I wouldn't worry about it.

56:42.186 --> 56:44.318
Dreaming is not
a primordial function.

56:44.493 --> 56:48.410
Dreams do not serve
any evolutionary purpose.

56:50.324 --> 56:51.717
Any more questions?

56:53.502 --> 56:56.592
In the last three months,
what's impressed me the most

56:56.766 --> 56:58.376
is how social trees are.

56:58.724 --> 57:00.770
In the wilderness,
we can imagine

57:00.944 --> 57:03.729
that they compete and struggle
against each other

57:03.903 --> 57:06.166
for light, for space,

57:06.906 --> 57:08.691
but they also help
one another.

57:09.431 --> 57:12.390
They seem
very interested in keeping

57:12.782 --> 57:17.003
every member
of their community alive.

58:51.010 --> 58:52.403
Hey...

58:56.233 --> 58:57.843
Hey buddy.

59:00.890 --> 59:03.196
<i> Would you like me
to interact with the pod</i>

59:03.414 --> 59:04.589
<i>while you're working?</i>

59:04.763 --> 59:07.984
No... No, thanks, Elena.

59:08.201 --> 59:10.334
<i> Let me know
if I can be of any help.</i>

59:14.904 --> 59:16.819
I am sorry to jump in, Rachel,

59:17.036 --> 59:21.171
<i>but your word count since
this morning is 1342 words,</i>

59:21.388 --> 59:23.565
<i>including footnotes and endnotes.</i>

59:23.782 --> 59:27.612
<i>Your productivity is 24.5%
lower than usual.</i>

59:28.395 --> 59:30.310
Thanks for letting me know.

59:30.528 --> 59:33.052
<i> I am feelings
some irritation in your voice.</i>

59:33.270 --> 59:35.098
<i>Is there anything
I could do to help?</i>

59:35.272 --> 59:38.101
No irritation.
Thanks for inquiring.

01:00:27.324 --> 01:00:28.978
Whoa!

01:00:34.287 --> 01:00:36.115
We did it!

01:00:38.814 --> 01:00:40.250
We did it!

01:00:41.425 --> 01:00:43.035
We did it!

01:00:44.428 --> 01:00:47.126
<i>Let Us play Yesterday</i>

01:00:47.692 --> 01:00:52.958
<i>I - the Girl at school -
You - and Eternity</i>

01:00:53.176 --> 01:00:55.178
<i>the Untold Tale -</i>

01:00:55.395 --> 01:00:59.312
<i>Easing my famine

01:00:59.530 --> 01:01:02.925
<i>had I - for Drink -

01:01:19.985 --> 01:01:24.642
<i>Somewhat different - must be -

<i>Cunning Reds of Morning

01:01:31.605 --> 01:01:34.870
You recognize
its beauty for the first time.

01:01:35.044 --> 01:01:38.221
And you know what?
You also really see it.

01:01:43.400 --> 01:01:44.749
Whoa-whoa-whoa!

01:01:46.533 --> 01:01:50.363
<i>Still at the Egg-life -
Chafing the Shell -</i>

01:01:50.581 --> 01:01:52.844
<i>When you troubled

01:01:53.976 --> 01:01:55.412
<i>And the Bird fell -</i>

01:02:00.373 --> 01:02:02.201
I want you all to find a tree.

01:02:03.420 --> 01:02:04.900
Or a plant.

01:02:06.249 --> 01:02:07.424
Go on.

01:02:14.736 --> 01:02:16.738
Now, I want you to hug it.

01:02:19.915 --> 01:02:21.655
Or just touch it.

01:02:23.788 --> 01:02:25.398
Don't be shy.

01:02:29.576 --> 01:02:31.143
Close your eyes.

01:02:33.624 --> 01:02:35.017
Inhale.

01:02:37.976 --> 01:02:39.325
Exhale.

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:45.723
When we stare at leaves
or touch a tree we can't

01:02:46.637 --> 01:02:48.770
mull over thoughts.

01:02:50.597 --> 01:02:52.338
We have to let go.

01:02:53.426 --> 01:02:56.386
Slowly, our attention circuits
get disconnected.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:58.736
Our frontal cortex calms down.

01:02:58.910 --> 01:03:00.390
Our minds

01:03:00.999 --> 01:03:03.219
can wander again

01:03:03.915 --> 01:03:06.004
and set itself free.

01:03:25.023 --> 01:03:28.287
-  Hey Alvy.
Got a second?
- Yeah.

01:03:29.288 --> 01:03:30.942
-  Oh!
-  Yeah.

01:03:31.116 --> 01:03:32.770
Congratulations!

01:03:33.902 --> 01:03:36.687
I didn't know that you
and Rachel were pregnant!

01:03:36.861 --> 01:03:39.211
- Can I?
- Yeah.

01:03:39.385 --> 01:03:41.474
- When's it due?
- May.

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:44.782
- Spring baby.
- That's fantastic.

01:03:45.217 --> 01:03:47.176
Listen, I just want to chat
with you a bit.

01:03:47.350 --> 01:03:48.525
Uh-huh.

01:03:50.483 --> 01:03:52.572
Well, we were

01:03:52.746 --> 01:03:55.488
looking over the budget
for the biology department.

01:03:55.662 --> 01:03:57.012
Mm-hm.

01:03:57.186 --> 01:03:59.318
And sadly,

01:03:59.492 --> 01:04:03.801
the greenhouse maintenance
just seems a bit too...

01:04:05.411 --> 01:04:06.543
High.

01:04:07.239 --> 01:04:09.241
Yes, unfortunately.

01:04:10.112 --> 01:04:12.331
So we were thinking,

01:04:12.505 --> 01:04:14.681
of course,
if you'd be up for the idea,

01:04:15.073 --> 01:04:16.858
that we could...

01:04:17.032 --> 01:04:20.122
that we could introduce holograms.

01:04:20.296 --> 01:04:23.734
And then
we could just progressively
phase out the plants

01:04:23.908 --> 01:04:25.127
to reduce our cost.

01:04:25.301 --> 01:04:27.564
You want to replace my...

01:04:28.478 --> 01:04:32.438
my lotus, my taro, loofah,

01:04:32.612 --> 01:04:36.573
chamomile, borage,
nigella, my crocuses,

01:04:36.747 --> 01:04:39.619
my orchids with holograms?

01:04:43.145 --> 01:04:46.278
<i>-  These penguins
are heading</i>

01:04:46.496 --> 01:04:49.020
<i>to the open water
to the right,</i>

01:04:52.981 --> 01:04:55.244
<i>but one of them caught
our eye:</i>

01:04:55.461 --> 01:04:57.028
<i>the one in the center.</i>

01:04:58.943 --> 01:05:00.553
He would neither go towards

01:05:00.771 --> 01:05:02.729
<i>the feeding grounds
at the edge of the ice</i>

01:05:02.947 --> 01:05:05.732
<i>nor return to the colony.</i>

01:05:07.517 --> 01:05:10.389
<i>With 5000 km ahead of him,</i>

01:05:10.607 --> 01:05:13.349
<i>he's heading towards
certain deaths.</i>

01:05:16.047 --> 01:05:19.007
It'’s silly, but...

01:05:19.572 --> 01:05:22.314
that penguin, it just...

01:05:26.536 --> 01:05:28.842
Should we
bring it back earlier?

01:05:31.106 --> 01:05:32.281
Why?

01:05:33.108 --> 01:05:36.633
I mean, we're just getting
used to all this.

01:05:36.807 --> 01:05:38.852
I don't want you to feel

01:05:39.027 --> 01:05:41.246
like you're stuck at home
with the baby.

01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:43.466
No, I don't feel stuck.

01:05:44.510 --> 01:05:47.252
I mean, we went
for a walk today. We went...

01:05:47.426 --> 01:05:48.732
We went to campus.

01:05:49.298 --> 01:05:50.473
You...

01:05:51.343 --> 01:05:53.737
- You took the part to work?
-  Yeah.

01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:57.784
Some of it well stick,
you know.

01:06:23.288 --> 01:06:25.682
I just feel like he's...

01:06:25.856 --> 01:06:27.684
like he's being reckless.

01:06:27.858 --> 01:06:31.122
- Like he's acting reckless.

01:06:31.296 --> 01:06:33.081
What did he do?

01:06:33.255 --> 01:06:35.387
Well, he, like...

01:06:35.561 --> 01:06:38.608
- He wears the pod
on the front.
-  Why is that reckless?

01:06:38.782 --> 01:06:40.784
Because
most of the dads that I see,

01:06:40.958 --> 01:06:43.221
they wear the pods
on the back.

01:06:44.875 --> 01:06:46.572
Why does it bother you?

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:51.099
No, it doesn't bother me.
I just don't...

01:06:51.708 --> 01:06:52.970
I don't get it.

01:06:53.449 --> 01:06:56.234
They're bonding.
You should be happy.

01:06:56.539 --> 01:06:57.801
Yeah.

01:06:58.367 --> 01:07:01.109
OK, so I know this is
going to sound so weird

01:07:01.283 --> 01:07:03.198
because
I'm not technically pregnant,

01:07:03.372 --> 01:07:05.287
but I've been having
the weirdest dreams.

01:07:05.461 --> 01:07:08.290
-  Yeah?
- Yeah, is that,
like, do you...

01:07:09.247 --> 01:07:10.857
- Y-yes. Yes!

01:07:11.032 --> 01:07:14.383
Last week I dreamt that
a snake bit me in the back

01:07:14.557 --> 01:07:17.734
and then apologized, saying
the venom could hurt the baby.

01:07:20.215 --> 01:07:21.781
Are you exhausted?

01:07:22.782 --> 01:07:24.567
Yes.

01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:25.872
But...

01:07:26.047 --> 01:07:27.439
once you can get through that,

01:07:27.613 --> 01:07:29.398
you can get through anything
in life.

01:07:30.051 --> 01:07:31.443
Yeah.

01:09:25.731 --> 01:09:28.952
My mother sent us this book
about Attachment Parenting.

01:09:29.909 --> 01:09:32.390
Apparently, being
continuously close to a baby

01:09:32.564 --> 01:09:34.610
helps them develop empathy

01:09:34.784 --> 01:09:37.178
and also benefits the parents.

01:09:37.352 --> 01:09:38.788
It's an old theory.

01:09:40.659 --> 01:09:44.533
- Oh! 1974!

01:09:45.273 --> 01:09:47.405
Who knows?
Maybe it's still relevant.

01:09:48.537 --> 01:09:50.539
Isn't the whole
Womb Center philosophy

01:09:50.713 --> 01:09:52.932
centered
on Detachment Parenting?

01:09:53.106 --> 01:09:56.762
Yeah, but it's interesting
to confront philosophies.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:07.382
I think we should
consult Eliza about all this.

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:10.907
Why?
I'm feeling perfectly fine.

01:10:12.430 --> 01:10:13.518
I'm not.

01:10:18.784 --> 01:10:21.265
<i> What brings you all
here today?</i>

01:10:21.439 --> 01:10:23.659
We're having a hard time

01:10:23.833 --> 01:10:26.879
finding our balance
as a family.

01:10:27.053 --> 01:10:29.969
Like, everything
seems to be revolving

01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:32.363
around the pod.

01:10:32.929 --> 01:10:34.235
The baby.

01:10:36.149 --> 01:10:37.977
Baby, I'm sorry, I...

01:10:38.151 --> 01:10:39.805
I don't see a pod,

01:10:39.979 --> 01:10:41.372
I see a baby.

01:10:42.068 --> 01:10:45.333
<i> All family members
have to make adjustments</i>

01:10:45.550 --> 01:10:47.596
<i>to welcome this new addition.</i>

01:10:47.813 --> 01:10:51.687
<i>Your family dynamics are about
to undergo tremendous changes,</i>

01:10:51.904 --> 01:10:54.429
<i>and these changes
directly affect you.</i>

01:10:54.603 --> 01:10:56.822
Yes. Thanks for that, Eliza.

01:10:56.996 --> 01:10:58.563
Yeah. I just feel

01:10:58.737 --> 01:11:01.566
as though Alvy is able to bond

01:11:01.740 --> 01:11:03.829
with our child,

01:11:04.177 --> 01:11:05.309
but I-I'm not.

01:11:05.483 --> 01:11:07.790
I just spend more time with

01:11:08.617 --> 01:11:10.271
the pod, you know?

01:11:10.445 --> 01:11:11.881
It's...

01:11:12.447 --> 01:11:14.318
It's as simple as that.

01:11:15.145 --> 01:11:16.712
You know?

01:11:17.147 --> 01:11:20.585
Maybe that attachment theory
wasn't that crazy after all.

01:11:20.759 --> 01:11:23.806
What do you think about
attachment theory, Eliza?

01:11:24.023 --> 01:11:25.982
<i> It's obsolete, Alvy.</i>

01:11:26.156 --> 01:11:28.637
As a mother,
I should feel connected.

01:11:28.811 --> 01:11:30.378
You're overthinking it.

01:11:30.552 --> 01:11:32.554
You're completely
tuned to the pod.

01:11:32.728 --> 01:11:37.254
Just give yourself
some time, you know?

01:11:37.428 --> 01:11:39.952
Honey, maybe it's hormonal.
- Hormonal?

01:11:40.126 --> 01:11:43.304
What do you mean, hormonal?
Why do you get the hormones?

01:11:43.478 --> 01:11:45.001
I'm not saying I have them,

01:11:45.175 --> 01:11:47.220
although I did forget
my phone in the fridge.

01:11:47.830 --> 01:11:50.093
And... I have been feeling--

01:11:50.267 --> 01:11:54.880
Maybe I'm...
I'm just not ready

01:11:55.359 --> 01:11:56.839
to be a mother.

01:11:57.927 --> 01:12:00.495
No one's a mother
just like that.

01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:03.889
You become one.
Isn't that right, Eliza?

01:12:06.152 --> 01:12:07.719
Eliza?

01:12:08.241 --> 01:12:11.897
<i> Would you mind connecting me
directly to the pod?</i>

01:12:14.204 --> 01:12:15.684
What?

01:12:15.901 --> 01:12:18.426
Therapy can start in utero.

01:12:18.643 --> 01:12:22.125
<i>You just need to find
the therapy icon on your app.</i>

01:12:26.347 --> 01:12:29.437
- It might be a little tight

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:31.526
to pull over.

01:12:33.049 --> 01:12:35.443
I mean, that's too tight.

01:12:42.319 --> 01:12:44.930
Yup, should be...
There we go. Perfect.

01:13:02.861 --> 01:13:04.820
Wood, fire, earth, metal...

01:13:08.737 --> 01:13:11.609
We are talking
about true ownership here.

01:13:11.783 --> 01:13:14.264
Unstoppable transfers
and Immutable provenance.

01:13:14.438 --> 01:13:17.746
Built-in-randomness
ensures decentralization.

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:20.401
The nodes are redistributed
across shards in a uniform

01:13:20.575 --> 01:13:21.619
and non-deterministic way.

01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.062
- Hey.
- Hey!

01:13:30.236 --> 01:13:31.237
You got a minute?

01:13:31.412 --> 01:13:33.588
Of course, yeah.

01:13:33.762 --> 01:13:36.721
- Um... Rachel.
- Yes.

01:13:38.027 --> 01:13:41.422
I wouldn't bring the pod
here if I were you.

01:13:43.989 --> 01:13:46.209
Um... Why?

01:13:46.383 --> 01:13:47.993
HR. They don't like it.

01:13:48.167 --> 01:13:49.560
They see it as a distraction.

01:13:49.734 --> 01:13:51.432
Oh my God...

01:13:51.606 --> 01:13:54.739
You don't want to be labeled
"the distracted mom".

01:13:54.913 --> 01:13:57.089
Distracted mom?

01:13:58.743 --> 01:14:00.658
The meeting
this morning was...

01:14:01.833 --> 01:14:03.313
kind of embarrassing.

01:14:03.792 --> 01:14:04.836
Oh, God.

01:14:06.316 --> 01:14:07.578
Can I?

01:14:08.449 --> 01:14:09.537
OK.

01:14:11.190 --> 01:14:12.801
-  Come with me.
- OK.

01:14:14.629 --> 01:14:16.065
It's OK.

01:14:21.157 --> 01:14:22.463
Oh.

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:28.730
- So...
- Is yours in there, too?

01:14:29.992 --> 01:14:32.385
Oh no. We, um...

01:14:33.865 --> 01:14:36.868
We decided to keep ours
at the Womb Center
until birth.

01:14:37.042 --> 01:14:41.220
It just became too stressful
to have the pod at home.

01:14:42.395 --> 01:14:43.571
OK.

01:15:09.466 --> 01:15:10.859
Shit.

01:15:11.076 --> 01:15:12.469
<i>Is there anything I can do?</i>

01:15:24.002 --> 01:15:25.308
Good night!

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:35.797
This workshop is all about
your personal experiences

01:15:35.971 --> 01:15:37.668
and journeys with your pods.

01:15:37.842 --> 01:15:40.845
You're in a safe space
to share any

01:15:41.672 --> 01:15:45.197
emotional or logistical issues
you're facing

01:15:45.371 --> 01:15:46.547
during your pregnancies.

01:15:46.721 --> 01:15:48.244
- Everything OK?
- Yes. Sorry.

01:15:48.418 --> 01:15:50.202
It was just
a crazy day at work.

01:15:52.335 --> 01:15:55.512
After the meeting greet,
you're invited
to drop your pods

01:15:55.686 --> 01:15:57.122
in the incubation room.

01:16:23.105 --> 01:16:24.280
Maybe...

01:16:25.673 --> 01:16:27.283
we should ask
for an extension.

01:16:27.457 --> 01:16:29.415
They don't offer extensions, Alvy.

01:16:29.590 --> 01:16:31.417
Why are they so rigid?

01:16:32.593 --> 01:16:34.682
We're in a bonding phase.

01:16:34.856 --> 01:16:37.728
I know,
but we can still visit.

01:17:25.646 --> 01:17:27.952
I just don't understand
this rule.

01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:33.871
I guess
it was in the fine print.

01:20:14.684 --> 01:20:16.599
Rachel? Sorry, sorry.

01:20:16.773 --> 01:20:18.470
- Do you have a second?
- Yeah.

01:20:18.644 --> 01:20:20.472
-  Please.
- Sure.

01:20:22.431 --> 01:20:25.086
Thanks.
I just want us to touch base.

01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:27.479
-  Mm-hm.
- Is everything all right?

01:20:28.002 --> 01:20:30.308
-  Yeah.
-  Yeah?

01:20:30.482 --> 01:20:31.875
Yeah, why?

01:20:32.049 --> 01:20:34.008
Well, the algorithm,

01:20:34.182 --> 01:20:36.793
it noticed a change
in productivity.

01:20:37.533 --> 01:20:40.623
Uh-huh, well I've... I mean...

01:20:40.797 --> 01:20:44.366
Maybe I've been
a bit distracted lately.

01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:45.584
Feeling depressed?

01:20:45.758 --> 01:20:47.935
Depressed? No.

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:49.719
No? OK, low-key, you know

01:20:49.893 --> 01:20:53.070
like nothing's wrong,
but... nothing's right?

01:20:53.244 --> 01:20:55.116
No. Why?

01:20:55.290 --> 01:20:58.075
You have a baby in gestation
at the Womb Center, right?

01:20:58.249 --> 01:20:59.294
Mm-hm.

01:20:59.903 --> 01:21:02.993
- All good on that front?
-  Yeah.

01:21:03.167 --> 01:21:06.388
It has been
a wonderful experience.

01:21:13.308 --> 01:21:15.092
Oh, your baby's thriving!

01:21:16.789 --> 01:21:19.401
What can I say?
It all looks perfect.

01:21:19.575 --> 01:21:21.620
Just a few more days to go.

01:21:22.230 --> 01:21:25.276
Now, is next

01:21:25.450 --> 01:21:27.713
Wednesday a good delivery day?

01:21:28.279 --> 01:21:29.672
Delivery day?

01:21:30.238 --> 01:21:32.414
We have our due date,
don't we?

01:21:32.588 --> 01:21:34.764
Mm... We recently changed
our policy.

01:21:34.938 --> 01:21:37.375
We now induce
at 39 weeks at full term.

01:21:37.549 --> 01:21:40.901
Some of the babies weren't
releasing their birth hormone.

01:21:41.075 --> 01:21:44.295
They just linger in their pods
for a few more weeks.

01:21:44.469 --> 01:21:47.908
We can't afford that!
Our pods are in such demand.

01:21:48.082 --> 01:21:51.346
So here is the consent form

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:53.957
for your birth
inducing package.

01:21:56.046 --> 01:21:57.569
Er... what is it?

01:21:57.743 --> 01:21:59.484
Oh, it's oxytocin.

01:22:00.224 --> 01:22:02.574
It's the love hormone.
It's all natural.

01:22:04.402 --> 01:22:07.928
There was one other thing
we'd like to discuss with you.

01:22:08.102 --> 01:22:10.234
We wanted
to take the pod back with us

01:22:10.408 --> 01:22:11.932
and then bring it to you

01:22:12.106 --> 01:22:13.455
for the birth.

01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:16.458
Oh, I'm sorry,
that's not possible.

01:22:16.632 --> 01:22:19.678
Our Neuro-Enhancement
Workshop starts today.

01:22:19.852 --> 01:22:22.072
But you're welcome
for parental visits.

01:22:22.246 --> 01:22:24.248
Neuro-Enhancement Workshop?

01:22:24.422 --> 01:22:26.990
A wonderful workshop.
You don't want
your baby to miss out.

01:22:29.210 --> 01:22:31.299
I don't remember
signing up for that.

01:22:31.473 --> 01:22:33.823
Well,
it's all in your contract.

01:22:33.997 --> 01:22:36.217
The data we collect
is precious for science, too.

01:22:36.391 --> 01:22:38.915
It helps
our blue brain research.

01:22:39.089 --> 01:22:40.308
Blue brain research?

01:22:40.482 --> 01:22:41.831
Now, if you don't mind,

01:22:42.005 --> 01:22:44.877
let's focus
on some postpartum tips.

01:22:45.052 --> 01:22:48.881
Now, the most difficult aspect
of taking care of a newborn

01:22:49.056 --> 01:22:51.101
is it's undoubtedly
the sleep issue.

01:22:51.275 --> 01:22:52.363
But...

01:22:53.495 --> 01:22:55.584
We came up with a solution.

01:22:57.238 --> 01:22:58.804
There you go.

01:22:59.066 --> 01:23:00.502
And one for you.

01:23:07.422 --> 01:23:08.771
What is it?

01:23:08.945 --> 01:23:10.686
It's a dream pod, or a D-pod.

01:23:10.860 --> 01:23:13.558
It's very soothing
for newborns.

01:23:14.124 --> 01:23:17.171
We just launched it.
Parents are raving about it.

01:23:17.693 --> 01:23:19.390
What kind of dreams?

01:23:19.564 --> 01:23:22.437
Oh, it's a really
very simple dream content.

01:23:22.611 --> 01:23:26.310
It's funny dreams.
Friendly, short,
simple dreams, you know.

01:23:27.616 --> 01:23:31.446
The content will be upgraded
as the technology improves.

01:23:33.361 --> 01:23:35.972
No pods!
Leave our wombs alone!

01:23:36.146 --> 01:23:37.669
No pods!
Leave our wombs alone!

01:23:39.628 --> 01:23:41.978
I thought radical feminists
were pro-pod.

01:23:42.152 --> 01:23:45.199
- Not these radical feminists.

01:23:45.373 --> 01:23:47.375
- You know what,

01:23:47.549 --> 01:23:49.855
j-just wait here for me, OK?

01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:51.814
-  Yeah?
- Yeah, wait here.

01:23:52.380 --> 01:23:54.164
All right.

01:23:54.338 --> 01:23:57.080
No pods!
Leave our wombs alone!

01:23:57.254 --> 01:24:00.301
37 weeks is premature
but it'’s not uncommon.

01:24:00.475 --> 01:24:02.564
Do you remember
the time of the first blink?

01:24:04.348 --> 01:24:06.002
around 8 AM?

01:24:06.176 --> 01:24:07.917
Some babies are in a rush.

01:24:08.091 --> 01:24:10.137
Let me get a delivery room
ready for you.

01:24:10.311 --> 01:24:11.486
Thank you!

01:24:12.008 --> 01:24:13.923
Hi, sir.
I'll be right with you.

01:24:41.081 --> 01:24:43.474
- It's my pod.

01:25:00.361 --> 01:25:02.232
Do you mind
if I grab these?

01:25:02.406 --> 01:25:04.234
I guess you don't need them
now, right?

01:25:04.408 --> 01:25:08.020
Congratulations.
So exciting, isn't it?

01:25:08.456 --> 01:25:10.110
Good luck.

01:25:13.461 --> 01:25:16.464
No pods!
Leave our wombs alone!

01:25:59.681 --> 01:26:01.509
We have a 2-for-1 promotion today.

01:26:01.683 --> 01:26:03.337
Don't want
to grab another baby?

01:26:03.511 --> 01:26:05.687
Oh, no. I'm fine, thanks.

01:26:05.861 --> 01:26:08.907
We also have a promotion
on funny dreams.

01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:11.954
- No, thanks.
- Are you a fine member?

01:26:12.128 --> 01:26:14.609
- No.
-  What a cutie.

01:27:05.181 --> 01:27:06.617
Alvy.

01:27:07.227 --> 01:27:09.664
Alvy. Honey, wake up.

01:27:09.838 --> 01:27:11.100
Wake up.

01:27:17.846 --> 01:27:20.631
Jeez, the Womb Center
is relentless.

01:27:21.197 --> 01:27:23.852
Honey,
let's go to Shell Island.

01:27:25.288 --> 01:27:27.899
- What?
- Yeah, let's pack and go.

01:27:28.509 --> 01:27:29.510
What's going on?

01:27:29.684 --> 01:27:32.513
Let's have our baby there.

01:27:32.687 --> 01:27:34.254
What are you talking about?

01:27:35.429 --> 01:27:38.127
Let's have our baby in nature,

01:27:38.301 --> 01:27:40.216
just like you always wanted.

01:27:40.825 --> 01:27:43.088
Hold on.
What's going on, Rachel?

01:27:44.438 --> 01:27:47.658
I cannot have
our child's first experience
be the Womb Center.

01:27:47.832 --> 01:27:49.660
-  OK.
- Yeah?

01:27:50.226 --> 01:27:52.707
- OK, I'm not going
to argue with that!
-  OK!

01:27:52.881 --> 01:27:55.884
- What about Wozcek?
We should--
- Let's tell them...

01:27:56.798 --> 01:27:58.582
we're having a home birth.

01:27:58.930 --> 01:27:59.975
Yes.

01:28:00.845 --> 01:28:02.020
Tell them that.

01:28:07.896 --> 01:28:12.379
My wife's i-in a...
bonding phase with the baby.

01:28:12.553 --> 01:28:14.250
We'd like to...

01:28:14.424 --> 01:28:16.687
We'd like to keep the pod
until birth.

01:28:16.861 --> 01:28:19.211
Mr. Novy,
we discussed this yesterday.

01:28:20.125 --> 01:28:22.693
I'm sorry, it's not possible.

01:28:22.867 --> 01:28:25.087
The pod should never have left
the center.

01:28:25.261 --> 01:28:28.873
But there's a baby
in the pod, right? Our baby.

01:28:29.047 --> 01:28:32.050
We have...
we have jurisdiction

01:28:32.224 --> 01:28:33.748
on this this human being.

01:28:33.922 --> 01:28:35.532
Yes,

01:28:35.706 --> 01:28:37.491
the baby is yours,
but the pod is the property

01:28:37.665 --> 01:28:39.188
of the Womb Center.

01:28:40.450 --> 01:28:42.713
Bring the pod back here
safe and sound

01:28:42.887 --> 01:28:44.541
at your earliest convenience.

01:28:44.715 --> 01:28:46.935
Look,
what if I was to tell you

01:28:47.109 --> 01:28:49.720
that we are... considering

01:28:50.721 --> 01:28:52.244
having a home birth?

01:28:53.202 --> 01:28:54.943
I'm sorry.

01:28:55.683 --> 01:28:57.075
A home birth?

01:28:58.860 --> 01:29:00.818
Why on earth
would you want to do that?

01:29:00.992 --> 01:29:02.690
Well, um...

01:29:02.864 --> 01:29:05.736
Some pregnant couples
decide to have home births.

01:29:05.910 --> 01:29:09.827
It's perfectly safe and legal, so...

01:29:10.001 --> 01:29:11.525
You know?

01:29:11.699 --> 01:29:13.657
We could hire
one of your nurses.

01:29:13.831 --> 01:29:16.007
Oh, you don't need
one of our nurses.

01:29:16.181 --> 01:29:19.271
All you need is
the self-generated birth code.

01:29:19.446 --> 01:29:20.925
You see, the problem is,

01:29:21.099 --> 01:29:24.538
your baby is currently being
hosted in a womb

01:29:24.712 --> 01:29:27.410
that does not belong to you
nor your wife.

01:29:28.498 --> 01:29:30.500
Now, we have a long wait list.

01:29:31.066 --> 01:29:34.286
We don't want to risk
any damages to these pods
at birth, so please,

01:29:35.287 --> 01:29:37.464
let's get back to our senses.

01:31:53.077 --> 01:31:55.776
Oh, that'’s Usnea lichen.

01:31:55.950 --> 01:31:58.692
They attract
ruby-throated hummingbirds

01:31:58.866 --> 01:32:01.259
who use them
to camouflage their nest.

01:32:01.956 --> 01:32:05.176
I mean, lichens are
surprisingly fascinating.

01:32:05.350 --> 01:32:07.744
They're one of the earliest
life forms on Earth.

01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:12.488
Most people think
they're a type of moss.

01:32:13.010 --> 01:32:16.013
They're
their own kind of being,

01:32:16.187 --> 01:32:18.407
neither plant nor animal.

01:32:18.581 --> 01:32:20.409
Well, so what are they?

01:32:21.279 --> 01:32:24.152
- They're the perfect marriage.
- Yeah.

01:32:24.326 --> 01:32:26.197
Between fungus and algae.

01:32:26.371 --> 01:32:27.764
Yeah, OK.

01:32:40.821 --> 01:32:43.737
The whole forest is like a web

01:32:43.911 --> 01:32:46.130
of constantly evolving relationships.

01:32:46.304 --> 01:32:48.698
Everything is entwined
and overlapping.

01:32:48.872 --> 01:32:51.396
They look like
they're talking to each other.

01:32:51.571 --> 01:32:54.269
Yeah, well,
they do talk to each other...

01:32:57.185 --> 01:33:00.231
To them, it's more important

01:33:00.405 --> 01:33:04.671
to cooperate than to compete.
It's a synergistic system.

01:34:08.473 --> 01:34:10.693
It's not so bad, is it?

01:34:10.867 --> 01:34:13.000
Mm...
I could get used to it.

01:34:15.263 --> 01:34:18.919
There's just
so much silence here.

01:34:41.376 --> 01:34:42.682
Alvy.

01:34:44.074 --> 01:34:45.510
Honey.

01:35:31.426 --> 01:35:33.863
- Alvy?
-  Yeah?

01:35:34.037 --> 01:35:36.692
Er, it's not turning on.

01:35:36.866 --> 01:35:38.476
What's not turning on?

01:35:38.650 --> 01:35:39.695
The base.

01:35:40.957 --> 01:35:42.872
Could it be the fuse?

01:35:43.699 --> 01:35:45.875
No, the lights are on.

01:35:46.180 --> 01:35:47.224
Well...

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:50.271
I left it on...

01:35:55.667 --> 01:35:57.757
- These motherfuckers.
- What?

01:35:57.931 --> 01:35:59.976
They've disconnected it remotely.

01:36:00.629 --> 01:36:02.152
Then we need to go back!

01:36:03.284 --> 01:36:04.720
Let's not panic.

01:36:04.894 --> 01:36:07.418
No-no, we need to call them
right now.

01:36:07.592 --> 01:36:10.552
No, I will not give into
this obscene blackmail.

01:36:10.726 --> 01:36:13.033
This is about the baby!
This isn't about us.

01:36:13.207 --> 01:36:15.035
What's the pod's autonomy?

01:36:15.209 --> 01:36:17.472
Forty-eight hours, I think.

01:36:17.646 --> 01:36:20.475
Forty-eight hours?
Well, that's...

01:36:20.649 --> 01:36:22.825
That's enough. I mean...

01:36:22.999 --> 01:36:25.045
The baby is due
any minute now.

01:36:27.003 --> 01:36:30.137
- We need to take it easy.
- Are you out of your mind?

01:36:31.007 --> 01:36:32.226
No.

01:36:34.619 --> 01:36:35.925
Rachel.

01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:39.102
Rachel.

01:36:42.584 --> 01:36:44.455
We need to trust this.

01:36:45.979 --> 01:36:47.110
OK?

01:36:49.591 --> 01:36:50.984
OK.

01:36:53.116 --> 01:36:54.335
OK.

01:37:11.656 --> 01:37:14.007
Er...

01:37:22.798 --> 01:37:26.062
Um... OK...

01:37:26.236 --> 01:37:28.673
Um, we...

01:37:28.848 --> 01:37:30.023
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

01:37:35.376 --> 01:37:39.032
OK, so the app
is asking for a birth code.

01:37:39.206 --> 01:37:41.599
Er... Our due date.
Let me try that.

01:37:42.862 --> 01:37:44.820
No, it's not that.

01:37:44.994 --> 01:37:46.909
Maybe it's, er...
the conception date.

01:37:47.083 --> 01:37:48.693
OK... What is it?

01:37:51.871 --> 01:37:53.350
Maybe I...

01:37:53.829 --> 01:37:55.352
What are we going to do?

01:37:57.006 --> 01:37:59.661
- I'm going
to have to break it open.
-  No! No!

01:37:59.835 --> 01:38:01.271
It really, um...

01:38:02.969 --> 01:38:06.407
That seems really extreme
a reaction to Oh, no...

01:38:06.581 --> 01:38:08.539
Alvy, honey... Oh God.

01:38:08.713 --> 01:38:11.020
OK. Oh my God!

01:38:15.503 --> 01:38:17.722
- Maybe this one...
- Oh my God, is it OK?

01:38:17.897 --> 01:38:20.769
OK... All right.

01:38:23.076 --> 01:38:24.338
Let me try that.

01:38:24.512 --> 01:38:26.296
Oh God!

01:38:26.470 --> 01:38:28.124
- Alvy, be careful!
- OK!

01:38:31.475 --> 01:38:32.737
It's coming!

01:38:32.912 --> 01:38:34.914
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

01:38:37.394 --> 01:38:38.743
Our baby.

01:38:44.445 --> 01:38:46.142
-  You got it!

01:38:51.843 --> 01:38:53.497
Alvy!

01:39:22.048 --> 01:39:24.267
It's incredible.

01:39:35.017 --> 01:39:36.671
You're perfect.

01:40:56.490 --> 01:40:57.665
Hi.

01:41:02.452 --> 01:41:03.801
Standard or priority?

01:41:03.975 --> 01:41:05.325
Standard.

And guess who is the customer
at the Womb Center?

01:43:43.526 --> 01:43:45.136
I have to say the parents.

01:43:45.311 --> 01:43:46.312
No.

01:43:46.964 --> 01:43:48.357
The baby.

01:43:48.531 --> 01:43:50.751
This is all about the babies!

01:43:50.925 --> 01:43:54.407
Tell me, then,
how do you envision
the future for our children?

01:43:57.410 --> 01:43:59.847
Hopefully, one day

01:44:00.151 --> 01:44:03.242
