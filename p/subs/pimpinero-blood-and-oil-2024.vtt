WEBVTT

00:41.541 --> 00:46.625
2012. VENEZUELA IS THE COUNTRY
WITH THE CHEAPEST GAS IN THE WORLD.

00:46.708 --> 00:49.708
ON THE BORDER WITH COLOMBIA,
THAT SAME GAS COSTS UP TO 60 TIMES MORE.

00:49.791 --> 00:54.208
IN THIS NO MAN'S LAND,
DARING SMUGGLERS RISK THEIR LIVES

00:54.333 --> 00:57.041
TAKING ILLEGAL FUEL
FROM ONE COUNTRY TO ANOTHER.

01:07.875 --> 01:12.791
PIMPINERO: BLOOD AND OIL

01:48.583 --> 01:53.625
LA GUAJIRA, COLOMBIA
BORDER WITH VENEZUELA

02:29.375 --> 02:33.166
Juan, I bet you a beer you won't
make it to the bridge before Polito.

02:34.291 --> 02:35.791
Come on, Polito. Come on!

02:55.083 --> 02:57.083
Enough bullshit. You'll blow us up.

03:17.916 --> 03:19.875
Son of a bitch! I said slow down!

03:22.166 --> 03:23.041
Fucker.

03:56.375 --> 03:57.375
Come on.

03:58.750 --> 04:00.791
-Wait. Wait.
-Careful. Careful.

04:03.583 --> 04:05.958
Look at me. You all right?

04:06.750 --> 04:07.666
Yes, yes.

04:12.041 --> 04:14.000
It's another warning, Moncho.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.500
Who the fuck told Carmelo
about the bridge?

04:21.166 --> 04:23.375
Stop, Juan. Nobody said anything.

04:24.291 --> 04:26.375
-You okay, Marisol?
-What do you think?

04:26.457 --> 04:29.416
-We have to get back on the road.
-No, Juan. The cops will get us.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.125
We won't let them. I know what to do.

04:31.207 --> 04:33.625
Don't be stupid.
Not everyone here drives like you.

04:34.082 --> 04:35.375
Well, what do we do?

04:35.916 --> 04:38.541
Carmelo's guys will take us out
if we don't decide now.

04:41.125 --> 04:43.375
-There's the Campano farm, Moncho.
-No, Ulises.

04:43.625 --> 04:46.957
Those guys do business with Carmelo.
Plus, it's a three-hour detour.

04:48.166 --> 04:49.666
You got a contact there, Ulises?

05:01.208 --> 05:02.125
Just leave it.

05:11.666 --> 05:13.916
This bastard's gonna
charge us five per car.

05:14.000 --> 05:15.250
Fucking son of a bitch.

05:15.333 --> 05:17.707
-What should I do?
-Come on. Let's do it.

05:22.207 --> 05:24.875
Give me five jerry cans
and keep your mouth shut, dude.

06:43.041 --> 06:45.666
Hey, motherfuckers. Listen up.

06:47.250 --> 06:49.500
I'm splitting this among five
and there's eight of us.

06:49.957 --> 06:52.666
My brothers and I won't get
any payment or commission.

06:53.041 --> 06:54.541
It's not just the money, Moncho.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.416
We're going down trails we don't know.

06:58.832 --> 07:02.208
If this shit keeps up,
we'll end up in jail or in some hospital.

07:03.208 --> 07:06.916
This job has its risks.
We all knew that from the start.

07:07.708 --> 07:09.708
I know, but there are risks
and there are risks.

07:11.250 --> 07:14.500
I'll always be grateful to Juan
for giving me the chance to work here.

07:14.750 --> 07:17.332
But the business went to shit
when Carmelo took over.

07:17.500 --> 07:19.957
We've always stood up for you.

07:20.582 --> 07:23.207
-When did we ever let you down?
-I almost got killed today.

07:23.457 --> 07:26.250
And I have a son.
Are you gonna take care of him?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.541
No, Moisés.

07:29.125 --> 07:31.541
Take a look around. Do the math.

07:32.125 --> 07:34.166
There's eight of us. We used to be twenty.

07:35.750 --> 07:37.666
Patch things up with Carmelo.

07:56.582 --> 07:59.125
Happy birthday, babe.

08:02.083 --> 08:06.083
I bought it from a guy in Maicao.
Cool music, almost 1,000 songs.

08:06.791 --> 08:09.875
Wanna go to your house and listen to it?
I'll be good.

08:10.666 --> 08:11.791
Thanks.

08:16.750 --> 08:18.832
I heard they blew up the bridge.

08:19.582 --> 08:22.707
And we had to pay off the Campanos.
That's why I didn't you bring any gas.

08:25.791 --> 08:27.541
You don't like your gift or what?

08:29.082 --> 08:31.082
You knew what I wanted for my birthday.

08:31.832 --> 08:35.207
-You're still going on about that?
-Then why'd you promise me?

08:35.875 --> 08:37.332
Marisol almost died today.

08:37.457 --> 08:41.082
Well, that's better than
selling gas all day, right?

08:42.500 --> 08:44.915
Diana, this isn't for city girls,
and you know it.

09:09.791 --> 09:14.208
Ulises, I need an oil filter. You got one?

09:17.791 --> 09:18.833
Yeah.

09:19.750 --> 09:21.875
I'll look for it and give it
to you tomorrow, okay?

09:29.625 --> 09:32.790
Dude? You're wearing my cologne, dude.

09:32.875 --> 09:34.625
I'll get you another one.

09:34.708 --> 09:38.790
-Get your own. That's why you work.
-Pay me for the beer you owe me.

09:38.875 --> 09:40.125
-Don't act dumb.
-Asshole.

09:57.958 --> 09:59.165
Mr. Moisés.

10:00.916 --> 10:03.375
Did you tell Carmelo about
the bridge on the Limón trail?

10:04.625 --> 10:05.833
Did I what?

10:09.541 --> 10:10.750
A beer?

10:12.208 --> 10:15.541
-Who you working for, bro?
-Oh, man.

10:21.791 --> 10:24.375
Moisés, you have to open your eyes.

10:26.375 --> 10:29.416
Because the Estrada Clan
won't last forever.

10:29.833 --> 10:31.291
It's on the verge of extinction.

10:34.665 --> 10:38.458
People in town are scared. They're afraid.

10:39.708 --> 10:41.708
There's less and less gas and...

10:44.208 --> 10:46.375
In fact, don't be shocked if suddenly,

10:47.125 --> 10:49.165
I don't know,
the people get together and...

10:55.625 --> 10:56.833
That's your warning.

10:59.083 --> 11:00.125
Hey.

11:04.500 --> 11:05.791
You wanna get even or what?

11:08.583 --> 11:10.833
If you wanna get even, I got info for you.

11:11.875 --> 11:14.083
A really big caravan from Carmelo.

11:37.708 --> 11:40.040
Ulises, it's great that you're here.

11:40.125 --> 11:42.165
-What's up?
-You bring the cash?

11:44.250 --> 11:46.958
You took half our shipment
at Los Campanos.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.540
I was gonna pay you with that.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.750
Go cry to your mommy.

11:54.583 --> 11:57.208
Okay, give me two weeks.

12:02.625 --> 12:04.916
Better just give me
the keys to your wheels.

12:08.500 --> 12:12.166
The keys to my car? And how would I work?

12:14.083 --> 12:16.416
Watch it or he'll gouge your eyes out.

12:21.500 --> 12:23.000
The keys, Ulises.

12:33.665 --> 12:37.208
You got a week to get the rest
or you get out of here.

12:39.583 --> 12:42.208
Go. The night's still young
and it'll be great, man.

12:43.790 --> 12:44.915
Go get drunk.

13:06.000 --> 13:07.625
Don't bother me.

13:10.666 --> 13:13.708
-I thought you'd stood me up.
-You still mad or what?

13:15.000 --> 13:18.125
Sort of, but it's my birthday.

13:19.250 --> 13:20.833
Will you let me dance with you?

14:25.666 --> 14:29.000
ESTRADA BROTHERS

14:38.165 --> 14:42.165
-Last night's party was good, right?
-I'm young, Blanquita.

14:43.625 --> 14:45.125
Stop horsing around.

14:45.290 --> 14:48.250
Hey. Do you know what tattoo
you're gonna do on me?

14:51.665 --> 14:52.875
A little butterfly.

14:54.083 --> 14:57.665
Another one? No, Juan.
Stop doodling on yourself, Juan.

14:57.790 --> 15:00.125
Attention. We have breaking news.

15:00.875 --> 15:03.708
Go ahead, Juliana.
Tell us what's happening.

15:04.000 --> 15:08.166
The customs police, in coordination
with the Tax and Customs Administration

15:08.250 --> 15:09.333
and the national army,

15:09.416 --> 15:14.500
performed three simultaneous operations
and seized 15 tanks of smuggled fuel.

15:14.583 --> 15:18.291
They had the capacity
to hide close to 60,000 gallons.

15:18.625 --> 15:21.916
In these raids,
they found 34 plastic dice,

15:22.000 --> 15:24.708
17 filters, 470 jerry cans...

15:25.041 --> 15:26.791
That was Don Carmelo's caravan.

15:27.583 --> 15:28.791
Was it you?

15:29.041 --> 15:31.416
...approximately 627 million pesos.

15:31.625 --> 15:34.290
You know he won't let this slide, Moncho.

15:34.790 --> 15:36.540
...the smugglers were endangering

15:36.625 --> 15:40.250
the lives of thousands
of inhabitants of La Paz.

16:03.416 --> 16:04.666
Motherfuckers!

16:05.250 --> 16:06.291
Juan!

16:13.541 --> 16:16.125
-Get inside, Juliana.
-Let's go. Let's go already.

16:54.833 --> 16:56.125
Gentlemen.

16:58.208 --> 17:01.125
It's an honor to stand before
the legendary Estrada Clan.

17:04.708 --> 17:05.708
Juan.

17:12.458 --> 17:13.540
Ulises.

17:17.625 --> 17:20.500
-Long time, Moisés.
-How are you, Carmelo?

17:22.083 --> 17:23.583
Not as good as you.

17:24.665 --> 17:27.000
I need about 100 barrels of gas.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.625
We don't have a bridge anymore.

17:30.875 --> 17:32.541
And Villanueva needs a mechanic.

17:33.916 --> 17:35.041
Yeah.

17:37.208 --> 17:39.541
Want a popsicle? Popsicle?

17:40.208 --> 17:41.208
Popsicle?

17:43.750 --> 17:44.791
You sure?

17:45.291 --> 17:47.375
I got pineapple, tangerine, mammee apple.

17:49.083 --> 17:52.333
I'm gonna have one,
what with this fucking heat.

17:53.208 --> 17:54.833
Let's see, guys.

17:55.750 --> 17:58.416
If we keep this up,
we'll all end up like the mechanic.

17:58.583 --> 18:02.708
-So what do you propose?
-Simple. Work for me.

18:06.458 --> 18:10.083
What? Just ask any of my drivers.

18:10.583 --> 18:12.791
They all have better cars
than your junkyard crap.

18:12.875 --> 18:15.583
You know those cars are yours, not theirs.

18:15.666 --> 18:17.541
And those guys are
up to their necks in debt.

18:18.166 --> 18:20.000
But the runs are a lot safer.

18:20.375 --> 18:23.791
Because the new governor
just so happens to be my buddy.

18:25.791 --> 18:29.541
Look, I admire you guys, a lot.

18:30.416 --> 18:33.541
Everyone around here respects you.
And I value that.

18:33.625 --> 18:37.916
Enough to blow up a fucking bridge
and chuck a corpse onto our street?

18:43.583 --> 18:45.208
Think of it as a partnership.

18:45.833 --> 18:48.833
You'd keep 15% of what you get through.

18:49.500 --> 18:52.041
Plus a regular salary.
It's much more than what you make now.

18:52.625 --> 18:54.333
We're not for sale, motherfucker.

18:57.958 --> 19:02.041
Your caravan leader, Marisol,
she's with me now.

19:02.750 --> 19:03.750
And Fabián.

19:04.916 --> 19:06.708
Polito. Mejía.

19:07.333 --> 19:08.625
All mine.

19:11.916 --> 19:13.208
Wanna talk it over privately?

19:21.208 --> 19:25.541
-Why are you so quiet, Ulises?
-I think we should set our pride aside.

19:27.416 --> 19:29.083
You really want to work for him?

19:29.166 --> 19:31.708
-After what happened to Francisco?
-The offer's not bad.

19:32.750 --> 19:34.458
We won't pay any more bribes.

19:34.541 --> 19:37.000
We'll move more gasoline.
That's more money.

19:37.083 --> 19:40.708
-However you see it, we all win.
-No, the three of us can keep it going.

19:42.291 --> 19:45.916
Listen to what you're saying, bro.
Don't be stubborn.

19:46.708 --> 19:48.791
You just want easy money.

19:49.166 --> 19:51.458
You don't give a shit
about being independent, free.

19:51.541 --> 19:53.041
Nobody's free.

19:54.166 --> 19:55.291
Don't be naive.

19:56.208 --> 19:57.916
Smuggling isn't the only option.

19:58.291 --> 20:00.875
-It's all we know and we like doing it.
-No, no.

20:01.916 --> 20:04.416
I'm sick of smelling like gas
all fucking day.

20:05.875 --> 20:08.750
So, guys? Should I break out the whiskey?

20:09.708 --> 20:11.791
Ulises is the only one
who accepts the offer.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.041
What's Moisés planning on doing?

20:35.500 --> 20:37.875
He's gonna set up
an Italian restaurant with Blanca.

20:40.041 --> 20:43.291
At least he tried to fuck
that bastard Carmelo over with the raids.

20:45.666 --> 20:47.583
On the other hand, that asshole Ulises...

20:48.458 --> 20:50.791
It pisses me off
how he sold out like that.

20:51.916 --> 20:53.833
The three of us could continue, Diana.

20:55.125 --> 20:58.416
But you know what? It doesn't matter,
'cause I can do it alone.

21:02.625 --> 21:04.083
Know what my dad used to say?

21:07.083 --> 21:11.291
Going down a trail alone
is like going into the lion's den.

21:16.500 --> 21:17.708
Give me your gun.

21:20.250 --> 21:22.833
-Why?
-Give it to me.

21:38.750 --> 21:42.625
-Hey. Careful or you'll break a window.
-Shut up.

22:04.375 --> 22:05.583
Did your dad teach you?

22:07.708 --> 22:11.041
He also taught me how to drive.
How to change a flat.

22:11.791 --> 22:12.958
To stand up for myself.

22:17.000 --> 22:19.708
I'm not the little city girl you say I am.

22:23.208 --> 22:26.500
Juan, if I had the money,

22:27.125 --> 22:28.875
I would've bought my own car.

22:30.083 --> 22:32.916
So you're with me
just 'cause you want to smuggle gas?

22:33.958 --> 22:35.166
Among other things.

22:42.458 --> 22:44.041
I'll pick you up at 5:00.

23:22.625 --> 23:24.583
Welcome to Venezuela, babe.

23:59.041 --> 24:01.625
We're about to go back to Colombia.

24:09.875 --> 24:11.625
-Four grand.
-Three grand.

24:12.250 --> 24:13.875
-Yeah, okay. Deal.
-Deal.

24:20.208 --> 24:21.291
Three grand.

24:28.041 --> 24:30.500
Clear. We're going now.

24:58.833 --> 25:02.250
-What's up?
-Hey, Juancho, my brother.

25:03.041 --> 25:05.208
Hey, you brought your girlfriend.

25:05.750 --> 25:07.291
She's Antonio Márquez's daughter.

25:07.625 --> 25:10.750
-Did you know him?
-El Loco? Of course.

25:10.875 --> 25:14.708
He, your brother and Don Carmelo
helped open up some trails around here.

25:15.708 --> 25:17.916
She's pretty. She's pretty.

25:19.333 --> 25:21.875
Well, I'm here for the usual.

25:27.500 --> 25:28.791
Juancho, look.

25:29.625 --> 25:32.583
We got an order that anyone
not working for Don Carmelo

25:32.666 --> 25:35.041
can't keep buying their gas here.

25:36.458 --> 25:39.833
I'll make an exception for today.
But now you know.

25:41.166 --> 25:44.541
-Forty gallons, then.
-Forty gallons.

25:45.041 --> 25:47.250
Roland. Roland!

25:47.541 --> 25:50.333
Brother, what's with you?
Go and serve the boss.

25:50.500 --> 25:54.083
-Go, go. Fill up 40 gallons.
-Yes. 40.

25:55.291 --> 25:57.000
Dude, how's your sister?

25:58.333 --> 26:01.833
Hanging in there, man. You know how it is.

26:03.625 --> 26:07.750
If you need anything from Colombia,
just let me know.

26:10.291 --> 26:14.166
Clonazepam.
You know you can't get that shit here.

26:14.291 --> 26:17.000
I'll bring you some next time
I come to buy gas from you.

26:46.291 --> 26:48.500
Fuck. Juan.

26:48.833 --> 26:51.500
-Juan, what do I do?
-Pull over. Let me talk.

26:53.250 --> 26:55.000
Stop, stop, stop.

26:58.750 --> 27:01.541
Fuck. We won't buy them off with this.

27:02.291 --> 27:06.083
Diana! Diana, what are you doing?
Stop! Stop! Stop!

27:08.541 --> 27:09.916
Watch it!

27:13.541 --> 27:16.166
No one's coming. Speed up. Speed up!

27:19.291 --> 27:20.916
Fuck, you're crazy.

27:37.625 --> 27:40.416
Anyone else would've rolled over,
and that's how these cars blow up.

27:41.125 --> 27:42.458
But you did great.

27:43.875 --> 27:45.458
I'm proud of you.

28:07.083 --> 28:09.833
-Where are you coming from?
-Monte Lara.

28:16.958 --> 28:18.708
I asked her.

28:21.583 --> 28:22.541
Where are you going?

28:23.958 --> 28:25.208
To Villanueva.

28:27.250 --> 28:28.750
What happened to your car?

28:30.333 --> 28:31.291
The cops.

28:41.375 --> 28:42.416
No!

28:48.708 --> 28:49.583
Gasoline!

29:13.791 --> 29:15.000
Who are they?

29:15.750 --> 29:18.875
Pirates.
The people around here patrol the trails.

29:20.500 --> 29:21.750
Know what?

29:22.458 --> 29:26.541
I prefer having these guys rob us
and not the cops or Carmelo's bastards.

29:51.500 --> 29:52.958
Okay. Who's next?

30:07.500 --> 30:08.708
Thank you.

30:09.541 --> 30:11.500
The two of them would come like this,

30:11.916 --> 30:13.916
up to their necks in mud.

30:14.458 --> 30:16.208
They'd buy a goat from me.

30:16.416 --> 30:18.375
They'd leave two hours later

30:18.458 --> 30:20.875
without using
a single drop of water to clean up.

30:23.000 --> 30:24.458
His mom too?

30:24.541 --> 30:27.875
She ate the most,
more than any of her three sons.

30:27.958 --> 30:29.875
No, I can't believe it.

30:32.625 --> 30:36.375
Don't worry. I'll bring you your beer.

30:41.541 --> 30:43.750
How come you've never brought me here?

30:44.958 --> 30:47.500
It's really far
and I haven't come by in a long time.

30:48.000 --> 30:50.541
But Graciela prayed for us
on our first run.

30:52.500 --> 30:55.666
So? Did you like being a smuggler?

30:58.166 --> 30:59.333
Honestly...

31:03.333 --> 31:04.750
I was scared shitless.

31:07.666 --> 31:10.291
After today, I think it's in your blood.

31:10.875 --> 31:12.041
Like father, like daughter.

31:18.125 --> 31:19.875
I'll let you rest.

31:20.416 --> 31:22.541
-Thank you, Ms. Graciela.
-Thank you.

32:37.458 --> 32:39.166
Here's where I commend my soul to God.

32:47.125 --> 32:48.833
Close your eyes and make a wish.

32:51.458 --> 32:52.958
And it'll come true?

32:54.375 --> 32:56.125
Mine already came true.

33:12.208 --> 33:13.708
Graciela gave me these.

33:15.708 --> 33:16.916
This one's for you.

33:18.458 --> 33:19.958
Not everyone gets them.

33:23.666 --> 33:24.500
Thanks.

33:31.208 --> 33:33.333
This run has been really important for me.

33:37.750 --> 33:39.208
Listen closely, Diana.

33:40.333 --> 33:41.875
The Estrada Clan is over.

33:42.666 --> 33:44.500
And you need to know
that you're much better

33:44.583 --> 33:46.708
than those fuckers who left with Carmelo.

33:47.666 --> 33:49.291
I'll do two or three more runs.

33:49.375 --> 33:53.416
Then we'll buy a car and set up a co-op,
or we'll smuggle just you and me.

33:54.041 --> 33:55.083
Alone.

33:56.666 --> 33:59.833
-And he'll let us?
-We won't ask for his permission.

34:17.583 --> 34:19.375
And why don't we just leave?

34:21.000 --> 34:23.750
-And go where?
-I don't know.

34:24.958 --> 34:27.208
We can save up
for a month or two like you say,

34:27.541 --> 34:29.208
and start a new life somewhere else.

34:32.291 --> 34:33.291
Where, Diana?

34:34.666 --> 34:36.083
No idea.

34:37.875 --> 34:40.375
The world's really big. I want to see it.

34:44.791 --> 34:46.416
And I want to see it with you.

34:51.750 --> 34:56.375
But these trails won't
let you go that easily, right?

35:11.666 --> 35:14.291
Wouldn't you like to do this
on the beach, Juan?

35:19.375 --> 35:22.125
I'll do a couple more runs
and we'll use that money to leave.

35:37.625 --> 35:39.000
Pay up, asshole!

35:39.083 --> 35:41.916
Pay up! Pay up!

35:42.000 --> 35:43.958
Pay up, asshole.

35:44.208 --> 35:47.416
Pay up. Give me that. Pay me.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.208
-Have they opened yet?
-No. Nothing.

36:48.250 --> 36:51.416
-And the trails around the back?
-Impossible. It's complicated.

36:52.000 --> 36:53.125
The army's everywhere.

36:53.208 --> 36:55.833
-Well, let me know, okay?
-Yeah.

36:57.083 --> 36:58.625
The border's hot.

36:58.708 --> 37:01.500
We're leaving now.
We're going back. We can't cross.

37:01.583 --> 37:02.666
We're going back.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.041
Let's go.

37:13.875 --> 37:15.625
Twenty-four hours after the operation...

37:15.791 --> 37:17.708
Juancho, brother.

37:19.250 --> 37:22.916
The clonazepam.
I also got some mesquite leaves.

37:23.000 --> 37:25.791
Tell your sister to drink the tea
on an empty stomach for 10 days.

37:25.875 --> 37:26.916
She'll feel better.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.291
...the president of Venezuela,
Hugo Chávez...

37:29.375 --> 37:30.708
You were on the news.

37:30.791 --> 37:33.833
...ordered the closure
of the embassy in Bogotá. Patricia Uribe.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.958
Cristina, Chávez also gave
the order to move 10 battalions

37:37.041 --> 37:38.875
to the border with Colombia,

37:38.958 --> 37:41.958
adding a military component
to the crisis between the two countries.

37:42.041 --> 37:43.833
Mr. Minister of Defense,

37:43.916 --> 37:47.250
move 10 battalions
to the border with Colombia.

37:51.750 --> 37:52.666
Dad.

37:54.208 --> 37:56.458
Moisés. Have you heard?

37:57.125 --> 38:00.875
-No. What?
-They shut down the whole border.

38:02.750 --> 38:06.500
-It's not the first or the last time.
-Yes, but Juan is at Gonzalo's place.

38:07.333 --> 38:09.916
-Is he crossing?
-At 2:00 in the morning.

38:10.333 --> 38:12.750
He says gas will be more expensive
with the border closed.

38:12.833 --> 38:15.541
But I heard they've arrested
smugglers from other towns.

38:17.833 --> 38:18.666
Sit down.

38:25.500 --> 38:27.083
Relax. It'll be okay.

38:28.958 --> 38:31.500
Especially if he's alone.
Juan knows the trails really well.

38:34.875 --> 38:36.875
My dad also knew them well.

38:38.125 --> 38:39.333
That was different.

38:41.000 --> 38:44.166
Plus, the border's always shutting down.
There aren't always checkpoints.

38:45.708 --> 38:46.833
Want a beer?

38:48.250 --> 38:49.416
An aguardiente.

39:10.166 --> 39:12.208
Okay, man. Fine. Okay.

39:15.666 --> 39:16.708
Juancho.

39:17.291 --> 39:20.541
Bro, the area's militarized.
You have to leave now.

39:20.958 --> 39:24.583
-Dude, I'll get caught if I leave now.
-But I can't risk it.

39:26.166 --> 39:27.166
Look.

39:28.458 --> 39:30.666
Go out that way, through the soccer field.

39:31.041 --> 39:33.208
Take the trail that goes
straight to Perico.

39:33.291 --> 39:37.083
I know that route's longer,
but it'll be better for you.

39:38.458 --> 39:41.416
Fine. I'll put the tires on and go.

39:42.875 --> 39:44.250
Okay. Let me help you.

43:14.166 --> 43:16.125
Get down! On your knees!

43:20.333 --> 43:22.708
If it isn't mine,
it isn't anyone's, motherfuckers.

43:31.416 --> 43:32.791
Stay still!

44:20.833 --> 44:23.041
-Hello?
-Hi, Ulises.

44:24.625 --> 44:27.958
Hey. I need to ask you a favor.

44:38.958 --> 44:40.041
Bro.

44:41.666 --> 44:43.833
Diana, put this on.

44:58.041 --> 44:59.833
You can take it off now, Diana.

45:03.583 --> 45:04.666
Follow me.

45:22.708 --> 45:23.708
We'll be there soon.

45:24.583 --> 45:26.000
Let me do the talking.

45:26.666 --> 45:27.541
Ulises.

45:27.625 --> 45:30.541
-Don Carmelo. How are you?
-Fine. And you?

45:31.375 --> 45:33.333
I didn't know
you'd brought such good company.

45:33.416 --> 45:37.333
-I'm Diana, Juan's girlfriend.
-Nice to meet you.

45:38.458 --> 45:41.333
-Antonio Márquez's daughter.
-El Loco?

45:42.666 --> 45:45.208
-Yes, sir.
-My, how you've grown.

45:45.541 --> 45:47.291
I met you when you were little.

45:48.333 --> 45:50.000
But come, have a seat.

45:50.875 --> 45:53.083
Don Carmelo, thank you for

45:54.583 --> 45:57.083
meeting with us to talk.
You know the story.

45:58.333 --> 46:00.458
Yes, I heard. How's Juan?

46:00.583 --> 46:02.000
They haven't let me see him.

46:04.458 --> 46:06.250
They want to give him three to five years.

46:06.625 --> 46:08.083
That's a long time, right?

46:08.666 --> 46:11.625
Sometimes the cops
take it out on those poor kids.

46:12.250 --> 46:14.666
No, and they go on
these crazy chases over nothing.

46:15.875 --> 46:16.958
What's Moisés say?

46:17.958 --> 46:19.416
Moncho doesn't know I'm here, sir.

46:21.250 --> 46:23.958
So, what needs to be done?

46:25.291 --> 46:26.250
Don Carmelo,

46:28.333 --> 46:30.666
I need you to get Juan out of jail.

46:31.458 --> 46:34.833
I know you have contacts in the police
and you know the new governor.

46:41.666 --> 46:42.625
How about that?

46:44.791 --> 46:46.416
Like father, like daughter.

46:51.375 --> 46:54.291
For my buddy Antonio's daughter, anything.

46:56.750 --> 47:00.125
But I know that this won't be free.

47:01.541 --> 47:02.375
Or will it?

47:14.666 --> 47:15.750
Hello.

47:24.958 --> 47:26.208
What's up, Juli?

47:26.958 --> 47:29.791
-Did you miss me or what?
-Of course. I was so worried.

47:31.500 --> 47:34.541
But you gotta know I took your room
and I won't give it back.

47:34.666 --> 47:37.000
Are you all right? Yeah?

47:37.625 --> 47:40.458
I'm happy you're back. Come in.

47:43.208 --> 47:44.625
Juliana, come. Leave them.

47:45.375 --> 47:48.375
That smells good.
What are you cooking, Moncho?

47:49.291 --> 47:50.875
Beef with onions.

47:52.500 --> 47:53.958
Your favorite, Juan.

47:54.875 --> 47:57.625
Now you can call yourself
a real smuggler, right?

47:58.833 --> 48:00.500
Juliana, honey, set the table.

48:01.333 --> 48:02.375
I'm coming.

48:04.583 --> 48:06.291
I'll show you the tattoo I drew for you.

48:06.666 --> 48:09.083
It turned out insane.
You'll like it. You'll like it.

48:09.708 --> 48:11.375
It's a cobra. So fucking cool.

48:17.666 --> 48:19.291
It's just for a little while.

48:21.000 --> 48:23.000
While we save up to leave.

48:24.500 --> 48:27.000
Yeah, I know. It's fine.

48:32.291 --> 48:33.541
Are you mad at me?

48:36.833 --> 48:39.291
I'm here with you, not on a cot in jail.

48:40.166 --> 48:42.250
You did what you had to. I said it's fine.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.208
I'll cuddle you.

49:18.208 --> 49:20.666
Gentlemen. Come over here.

49:23.750 --> 49:27.166
Move it. Quick. Quick.

49:29.166 --> 49:32.208
I want you all to welcome
the new member of the group.

49:32.583 --> 49:33.916
Juan Estrada.

49:40.458 --> 49:44.291
Washed and polished. For the spoiled boy.

49:46.416 --> 49:47.958
Now pay attention.

49:48.625 --> 49:52.625
Ulises, Guille, Batea, El Guapo.

49:53.458 --> 49:55.750
You'll come with Gregorio and me.

49:56.125 --> 49:57.833
The rest will follow Marisol.

50:03.625 --> 50:05.708
Why are they splitting us up?
Where are you going?

50:06.583 --> 50:10.333
I don't know, bro.
But it's all good. Relax.

52:00.708 --> 52:01.791
I'm leaving.

52:05.541 --> 52:07.958
-When will you be back?
-Tomorrow.

52:14.666 --> 52:15.708
What?

52:19.500 --> 52:21.083
You want to stay with me?

52:23.833 --> 52:25.375
Go before it gets late.

52:29.666 --> 52:30.833
Go.

52:34.958 --> 52:37.208
Go. You'll get me all wet. Juan.

52:52.708 --> 52:55.250
Juan, new orders.

52:56.958 --> 52:59.625
Get in the car and follow Gregorio.

53:00.416 --> 53:01.416
Where are we going?

53:02.458 --> 53:05.333
-A special shipment for Don Carmelo.
-What shipment?

53:06.958 --> 53:08.500
Just follow orders, kid.

53:09.875 --> 53:12.041
Go on. Ulises.

53:41.291 --> 53:43.916
-How many are there?
-Seven. They came this morning.

53:45.958 --> 53:49.250
They're still out of it.
Make them drink. They're dehydrated.

53:49.416 --> 53:50.416
Let's go.

53:59.541 --> 54:01.125
-What is this shit?
-Let's go.

54:01.833 --> 54:03.041
Come on.

54:08.458 --> 54:09.750
Up, up, up.

54:16.333 --> 54:17.375
Here, Ulises.

54:21.416 --> 54:22.291
Let's go.

54:22.375 --> 54:25.041
Don't even think about pulling anything.
You hear me?

54:28.708 --> 54:30.708
Move it. The caravan's leaving.

54:46.333 --> 54:48.083
You've already smuggled people.

54:48.875 --> 54:51.458
Yeah. But never kids, bro.

54:52.666 --> 54:54.625
Why the fuck didn't you tell me?

54:55.708 --> 54:57.625
Because you're a ticking time bomb, Juan.

54:59.250 --> 55:01.666
That's how things are now. Play the game.

55:47.208 --> 55:48.500
Take your hood off.

56:00.125 --> 56:01.208
You want some water?

56:19.333 --> 56:23.291
The army's up ahead.
We'll take a detour through Cerro Pintado.

56:23.375 --> 56:26.166
I repeat, detour through Cerro Pintado.

56:29.375 --> 56:30.750
Where are you taking me?

57:04.458 --> 57:05.458
I'll be right back.

57:37.125 --> 57:39.500
Juan, do you copy? Juan.

57:44.041 --> 57:45.125
Marisol, do you copy?

57:46.541 --> 57:48.416
Affirmative. I copy.

57:50.416 --> 57:53.125
I'm going back. I think
something happened to Juan's truck.

57:53.833 --> 57:56.500
Copy that.
Report back as soon as possible.

58:07.250 --> 58:09.500
Thank you very much. See you in a bit.

58:22.583 --> 58:25.541
Don't worry. It's my brother.
Put on the hood.

58:30.375 --> 58:31.875
What happened? Everything okay?

58:37.166 --> 58:39.750
-I won't deliver that girl, Ulises.
-What?

58:40.166 --> 58:42.750
Did you hear this is
a special shipment for Don Carmelo?

58:42.833 --> 58:45.666
She's practically the same age
as Juliana, motherfucker.

58:45.750 --> 58:46.875
I know, I know.

58:47.541 --> 58:50.208
What do you know about
these kids' lives in Venezuela?

58:50.750 --> 58:52.625
Our job is to cross the border. That's it.

58:52.708 --> 58:54.958
Whiskey, gas, anything. But not kids.

58:55.041 --> 58:57.333
Yeah, but we don't make
our own choices anymore, Juan.

58:58.125 --> 59:00.250
We work for an organization.

59:00.458 --> 59:02.625
Those people got you out of jail.
Don't forget that.

59:02.708 --> 59:05.875
Once I leave this kid somewhere safe,
Diana and I are skipping town.

59:05.958 --> 59:07.708
Really? And then what?

59:07.791 --> 59:11.125
What'll you do? Don Carmelo
will find you wherever you go, dude.

59:11.208 --> 59:13.291
And he'll kill me.
Did you think about that?

59:13.375 --> 59:15.500
-Or do you only think about yourself?
-Come with me.

59:16.500 --> 59:18.208
Look at me. Look at me. Let's go.

59:19.375 --> 59:23.041
Let's go and we'll figure it out.
We're brothers. We'll defend each other.

59:23.500 --> 59:25.166
Like we've always done.

59:26.583 --> 59:27.541
Listen, Juan.

59:27.666 --> 59:29.708
Or keep being Carmelo's soldier
if you want.

59:29.875 --> 59:31.458
Listen to me, Juan. Listen to me.

59:31.541 --> 59:34.625
Dude, no, Juan. Please listen.
Listen to me, bro.

59:36.541 --> 59:39.083
Don't do this to me.
I owe that bastard a debt.

59:39.166 --> 59:40.791
Yeah? Help me out.

59:41.125 --> 59:44.416
It's all I'm asking for. Help me, please.
Help me. I need...

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.291
-Moisés.
-Where's Diana?

01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:19.875
Nana.

01:00:27.541 --> 01:00:28.541
What's wrong?

01:00:32.541 --> 01:00:34.041
Diana, there was an accident.

01:00:36.958 --> 01:00:38.708
Ulises made it, but...

01:00:41.208 --> 01:00:42.416
-Juan...
-No.

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:48.833
-Hello.
-What's up, Ulisito?

01:01:52.708 --> 01:01:55.208
-Can you call back later?
-I'll be quick.

01:01:55.291 --> 01:02:00.083
It's just to tell you that,
for the favor I did for your brother,

01:02:01.333 --> 01:02:03.291
20% of your profits go to me.

01:02:03.625 --> 01:02:05.791
Pay me on time every two weeks.

01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.541
My deepest condolences.
For you and your family.

01:03:12.083 --> 01:03:13.583
Mom, how'd you do it?

01:03:15.708 --> 01:03:16.666
How'd I do what?

01:03:18.583 --> 01:03:19.958
When Dad died.

01:03:22.291 --> 01:03:26.708
Not knowing what happened
and just going on with your life.

01:03:29.958 --> 01:03:30.958
I do know.

01:03:33.750 --> 01:03:35.375
Your dad fell down a ravine.

01:03:36.916 --> 01:03:39.833
Do you really believe that?
Because I don't.

01:03:41.875 --> 01:03:43.541
I didn't just keep going.

01:03:45.416 --> 01:03:48.166
Your dad died
and I had to take you to Valledupar.

01:03:56.208 --> 01:03:58.833
But the pain becomes
more tolerable over the years.

01:04:00.250 --> 01:04:02.250
You have to learn to live with that.

01:04:04.166 --> 01:04:06.291
Because you're stronger.

01:04:08.958 --> 01:04:10.791
You're stronger than you think.

01:04:37.375 --> 01:04:38.541
How are you, Diana?

01:04:39.791 --> 01:04:43.208
Ulises, can you take me
to where Juan died?

01:04:47.458 --> 01:04:49.416
I don't want to go back there, Diana.

01:04:50.666 --> 01:04:52.375
I know it's also really hard for you.

01:04:55.250 --> 01:04:57.875
But I'm asking because I really need it.

01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.708
The thing is,
that trail's really dangerous.

01:05:07.500 --> 01:05:09.458
I don't believe Juan's car rolled over.

01:05:11.583 --> 01:05:13.250
He never had an accident.

01:05:16.041 --> 01:05:17.750
You saw how his body ended up, right?

01:05:23.000 --> 01:05:23.916
Yeah.

01:05:26.833 --> 01:05:28.500
What happened to your face?

01:05:31.666 --> 01:05:33.041
Drunk at a cockfight.

01:05:34.750 --> 01:05:35.666
I don't remember.

01:05:42.416 --> 01:05:44.625
Did you know
Juan almost didn't take the deal?

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.000
What deal?

01:05:48.125 --> 01:05:50.708
Getting out of jail in exchange
for working for Don Carmelo.

01:05:53.875 --> 01:05:55.541
If I hadn't told him...

01:05:56.125 --> 01:05:59.458
If I hadn't pressured him so much,
Juan would still be alive.

01:06:00.750 --> 01:06:02.041
In jail, but alive.

01:06:06.166 --> 01:06:07.541
It's not your fault, Diana.

01:06:08.583 --> 01:06:09.583
Marisol.

01:06:10.916 --> 01:06:11.916
What happened?

01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:16.875
I want to hear it from you. You were
his friend, you were in the caravan.

01:06:21.708 --> 01:06:24.625
Ulises realized that
Juan wasn't with the caravan,

01:06:25.416 --> 01:06:27.083
and he called, but he didn't pick up.

01:06:28.458 --> 01:06:31.250
So he went back
and that's when he found him.

01:06:31.666 --> 01:06:34.708
-But was the trail really hard?
-Hard in what way?

01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:37.541
For his car to roll over.

01:06:38.666 --> 01:06:41.916
Juan must've been going very fast
for the gas to blow up.

01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.250
-Why are you asking this?
-Did you hear the explosion?

01:06:50.458 --> 01:06:52.500
Cars explode when they roll over, right?

01:06:53.166 --> 01:06:54.291
Of course, Diana.

01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:58.083
That's why it's called
the caravan of death. You know that.

01:07:01.291 --> 01:07:03.666
What trail did you take?
Just tell me that.

01:07:07.291 --> 01:07:08.958
For the friendship you had with him.

01:09:46.082 --> 01:09:47.541
What are you doing here?

01:09:50.916 --> 01:09:52.291
Do you recognize this?

01:09:56.791 --> 01:09:58.625
It was next to Juan's truck.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:03.250
Since you didn't wanna take me,
I went alone. And I found it.

01:10:05.166 --> 01:10:06.208
Whose is it?

01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:12.125
-How the fuck would I know?
-It was next to the truck.

01:10:14.500 --> 01:10:16.833
-How'd you get out there?
-Know what?

01:10:19.458 --> 01:10:20.916
I didn't see any metal drums.

01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:24.208
I don't get how the truck
could explode like that.

01:10:29.458 --> 01:10:31.333
Me neither. I already told you.

01:10:32.416 --> 01:10:34.958
-Wait here, okay?
-Where are you going?

01:10:36.791 --> 01:10:39.708
To get the key
to the fucking truck, Diana.

01:10:40.916 --> 01:10:41.958
I'll be back.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:46.000
Ulises.

01:10:50.375 --> 01:10:52.208
How'd you get that bruise on your face?

01:10:54.291 --> 01:10:57.291
-Where'd you get that gun?
-Tell me the truth.

01:10:59.791 --> 01:11:01.083
Juan didn't crash.

01:11:03.458 --> 01:11:04.708
You saw them kill him.

01:11:08.041 --> 01:11:10.000
Tell me what happened, you son of a bitch.

01:11:10.791 --> 01:11:12.791
Tell me what you're hiding, you bastard.

01:11:13.708 --> 01:11:15.250
Tell me what you're hiding.

01:11:15.333 --> 01:11:17.625
Watch it or a bullet will get out
and make you a killer.

01:11:21.791 --> 01:11:23.583
Isn't this your sister-in-law, Ulises?

01:11:24.416 --> 01:11:26.416
Let her go, Miguel. We were just talking.

01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:32.666
A little birdie told me that you're asking
a lot of stupid questions around here.

01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:34.625
Let go of me.

01:11:40.666 --> 01:11:43.416
Looks like your problems
are piling up, Ulises.

01:11:46.291 --> 01:11:47.416
But don't worry.

01:11:48.166 --> 01:11:49.250
No. No.

01:11:49.458 --> 01:11:52.208
We're all family here
and we help each other out.

01:11:52.875 --> 01:11:55.458
Ulises. Ulises. No!

01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:07.208
-No. Let me go. No.
-Have one.

01:12:07.458 --> 01:12:09.333
-Come on, bitch. Have one.
-I don't want any.

01:12:09.416 --> 01:12:10.791
Drink, bitch. It's delicious.

01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.375
I don't want it. Asshole.

01:12:14.458 --> 01:12:18.833
Let go of me, you pig.
Let me go, you son of a bitch!

01:12:18.916 --> 01:12:21.458
Stay still. Still!

01:12:37.458 --> 01:12:38.458
Benito.

01:12:39.583 --> 01:12:42.833
Stop over there in
a lonely romantic spot for two.

01:12:44.416 --> 01:12:45.583
Well, for three.

01:13:36.833 --> 01:13:38.208
Help me get her down.

01:14:08.125 --> 01:14:09.333
Go turn that up.

01:14:51.958 --> 01:14:53.166
Watch out! Watch out!

01:14:55.166 --> 01:14:56.750
Take cover! Take cover!

01:14:58.125 --> 01:14:59.666
Get in, Miguel! Get in!

01:15:51.958 --> 01:15:53.333
You brought a kitty.

01:15:54.833 --> 01:15:55.791
What's its name?

01:15:56.500 --> 01:15:57.958
-Ninja.
-Ninja.

01:16:01.416 --> 01:16:02.500
Well...

01:16:03.875 --> 01:16:06.375
Come in. Welcome.

01:16:17.958 --> 01:16:20.166
The boss wants to see you
early tomorrow, okay?

01:16:21.541 --> 01:16:23.625
Since when are you
so chummy with Don Carmelo?

01:16:26.625 --> 01:16:29.250
Since my son can walk thanks to him.

01:17:16.416 --> 01:17:17.750
Easy, Diana.

01:17:18.916 --> 01:17:20.125
Have some.

01:17:21.791 --> 01:17:22.875
What happened?

01:17:23.541 --> 01:17:26.250
They brought you in last night.
You were unconscious.

01:17:28.166 --> 01:17:29.791
Why'd they bring me here?

01:17:30.208 --> 01:17:31.958
They recognized your necklace.

01:17:37.458 --> 01:17:40.583
Diana, Juan called me
the day of his accident.

01:17:40.708 --> 01:17:44.583
He told me he was bringing me someone,
that he'd explain later.

01:17:46.375 --> 01:17:47.375
Who?

01:17:48.375 --> 01:17:49.375
I don't know.

01:17:50.541 --> 01:17:54.000
-What else did he say?
-That he was crossing over from Venezuela.

01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:04.291
We weren't patrolling that area
on the day you say.

01:18:08.250 --> 01:18:11.791
Lately, there have also been
smuggler caravans bringing immigrants.

01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:13.791
Immigrants?

01:18:16.375 --> 01:18:17.416
Where do they take them?

01:18:18.125 --> 01:18:21.291
I heard they're taken
to a secret camp first.

01:18:21.375 --> 01:18:22.791
Then they're distributed.

01:18:23.291 --> 01:18:26.958
Cocaine labs, brothels, private armies.

01:18:28.041 --> 01:18:29.791
Carmelo's behind all that.

01:18:46.083 --> 01:18:47.625
It was on the ground.

01:18:58.250 --> 01:18:59.333
Thanks.

01:19:09.291 --> 01:19:11.125
We took this from your boyfriend.

01:19:29.208 --> 01:19:31.833
It's best you don't go back
to your town just yet.

01:19:36.166 --> 01:19:37.000
Bro.

01:19:37.750 --> 01:19:38.750
Come in.

01:19:48.458 --> 01:19:49.708
What's up, Ms. Julia?

01:19:50.708 --> 01:19:53.250
-Is Don Carmelo busy?
-No, sweetie. Go.

01:19:53.750 --> 01:19:55.375
Then stop by the kitchen.

01:19:55.458 --> 01:19:58.375
-I have some lunch for you.
-Thank you. Let's go.

01:20:02.458 --> 01:20:04.291
Excuse me. Miguel.

01:20:07.625 --> 01:20:08.541
Ulises.

01:20:12.125 --> 01:20:13.125
How are you?

01:20:14.375 --> 01:20:17.083
Good, sir. Thank you for the room.

01:20:19.458 --> 01:20:21.041
It's the least I could do.

01:20:23.541 --> 01:20:26.583
The key to my organization's success
is its harmony.

01:20:27.083 --> 01:20:29.500
For all parties to get along.

01:20:30.833 --> 01:20:32.458
For everyone to be happy.

01:20:34.333 --> 01:20:37.250
I know you two have
a complicated history, right?

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:39.000
Friends and rivals.

01:20:40.416 --> 01:20:42.875
But I want you to be like brothers.

01:20:44.041 --> 01:20:47.416
That's why, from now on,
your debts to Miguel are forgiven.

01:20:57.041 --> 01:20:58.708
Thank you very much, Don Carmelo.

01:20:59.833 --> 01:21:00.833
Look, Ulises.

01:21:01.875 --> 01:21:03.500
I wanted to ask you something.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.083
This girl, El Loco's daughter,
what's her name?

01:21:09.791 --> 01:21:11.416
-Diana.
-Right, Diana.

01:21:12.833 --> 01:21:14.916
Do you think she'll be a problem for us?

01:21:15.833 --> 01:21:17.250
A problem how, sir?

01:21:18.166 --> 01:21:21.208
Turns out your idiot friend
lost her yesterday.

01:21:22.208 --> 01:21:23.916
Now I feel like she's getting in our way.

01:21:24.791 --> 01:21:27.208
I don't think
Diana will be a problem, sir.

01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:31.083
But, if you want, I can keep an eye on her
and tell you if there's anything.

01:21:32.541 --> 01:21:35.166
Excellent. All right.

01:22:40.458 --> 01:22:42.791
I knew several smugglers were in on that.

01:22:44.666 --> 01:22:46.666
But I didn't know
Juan and Ulises were involved.

01:22:48.625 --> 01:22:51.708
They told me
they take immigrants to a secret camp.

01:22:53.125 --> 01:22:55.041
Ulises must be hiding there.

01:22:56.833 --> 01:22:57.958
Maybe.

01:22:59.083 --> 01:23:00.250
What'll you do?

01:23:01.125 --> 01:23:02.208
About what?

01:23:05.291 --> 01:23:06.333
About Ulises.

01:23:13.916 --> 01:23:14.750
Nothing.

01:23:16.875 --> 01:23:19.875
When our mother died,
Ulises practically raised Juan.

01:23:21.375 --> 01:23:23.666
I find it hard to believe
that he could hurt him.

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:28.166
Moisés, they almost
killed me in front of him.

01:23:28.750 --> 01:23:30.208
And Ulises did nothing.

01:23:31.166 --> 01:23:32.583
Diana, he's also my brother.

01:23:37.291 --> 01:23:38.333
Look, Diana.

01:23:40.208 --> 01:23:44.291
When the police caught Juan
and took him to jail, I was relieved.

01:23:46.708 --> 01:23:50.500
I understand why you got him out,
why you struck the deal with Carmelo.

01:23:50.875 --> 01:23:52.291
Believe me, I understand.

01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:57.625
But Carmelo's the type
who devours everything he touches.

01:23:58.791 --> 01:23:59.958
That guy's a cancer.

01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:08.000
Don't worry about your mom.

01:24:09.416 --> 01:24:12.416
-I'll look after her.
-Thank you, Moisés.

01:24:33.291 --> 01:24:34.500
Diana?

01:24:44.583 --> 01:24:45.583
Aunt.

01:24:47.791 --> 01:24:49.916
Aunt. Aunt Graciela.

01:24:51.291 --> 01:24:52.291
What's wrong?

01:24:53.208 --> 01:24:57.208
Someone stole Yesid's motorcycle.

01:24:57.416 --> 01:24:59.708
It was right there with the rest.

01:25:15.583 --> 01:25:17.458
It's time for the people!

01:25:17.541 --> 01:25:20.041
It's time for the fatherland!

01:25:20.166 --> 01:25:24.625
It's time to resurrect Venezuela!

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:28.458
The Venezuelan dream has come true.

01:25:29.875 --> 01:25:32.750
-Two blocks, then straight ahead.
-Thank you.

01:25:35.041 --> 01:25:38.916
Long live the fatherland!
Long live Venezuela!

01:25:39.541 --> 01:25:41.916
May God bless us all.

01:25:51.125 --> 01:25:54.291
All right, people.
It's time to go to the trucks.

01:25:54.500 --> 01:25:58.291
But first we'll do a search.
To the front, quick.

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.041
Hurry. I don't have all day.

01:26:06.416 --> 01:26:07.833
Okay. Okay.

01:26:09.416 --> 01:26:11.375
Get in, quick.

01:26:13.041 --> 01:26:14.083
Come on. Hurry.

01:26:14.166 --> 01:26:19.041
...Venezuela, proving they're not scared!

01:26:35.250 --> 01:26:39.166
Now get ready.
You'll have to walk for over six hours.

01:26:40.041 --> 01:26:41.416
Move it!

01:26:42.416 --> 01:26:43.500
Straight ahead.

01:27:12.750 --> 01:27:15.708
Get ready. We're gonna cross the border.

01:27:17.166 --> 01:27:19.875
You'll be in Colombia soon,
so get a move on.

01:27:24.625 --> 01:27:26.833
Once you're up, put your hoods on.

01:27:44.416 --> 01:27:45.958
Hoods, everyone.

01:28:13.708 --> 01:28:15.083
Get down.

01:28:17.083 --> 01:28:18.208
Fast!

01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:21.625
-Get organized, please! Get organized!
-Hurry! Hurry!

01:28:22.125 --> 01:28:26.583
Women on this side,
men on the other side, please!

01:28:26.750 --> 01:28:29.000
Hurry, hurry!

01:28:29.375 --> 01:28:30.583
Come on!

01:28:32.125 --> 01:28:33.416
People, let's go!

01:28:34.500 --> 01:28:39.666
I repeat, women on this side,
men on this side, please!

01:28:40.833 --> 01:28:42.000
Let's go!

01:28:45.625 --> 01:28:46.750
Let's go!

01:28:48.458 --> 01:28:51.250
People, come on. Hurry. Hurry.

01:28:51.333 --> 01:28:52.708
Move it. Move it.

01:29:09.916 --> 01:29:11.333
Ladies. Ladies.

01:29:12.458 --> 01:29:16.333
Listen up. You'll spend the night here.

01:29:17.250 --> 01:29:20.833
We'll ask for your info later
to see where you'll work, okay?

01:29:23.208 --> 01:29:26.541
You'll arrange
your own immigration documents.

01:29:27.083 --> 01:29:30.541
And you'll be able to see a doctor
once a month in Valledupar.

01:29:31.958 --> 01:29:34.833
You'll work for the organization
for a year.

01:29:35.958 --> 01:29:39.416
After that, you'll be free
to do whatever you want.

01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:43.541
Though I'm sure
you'll want to stay with us.

01:29:46.500 --> 01:29:49.041
You can eat today. It's completely free.

01:29:50.333 --> 01:29:53.541
Starting tomorrow, you'll have to pay.
Understood?

01:29:54.458 --> 01:29:55.500
Excuse me.

01:31:27.208 --> 01:31:28.916
You think you're MacGyver or what?

01:31:35.375 --> 01:31:37.916
Did you think
I wouldn't realize you're here?

01:31:40.375 --> 01:31:41.250
Freeze.

01:31:43.291 --> 01:31:44.375
Drop that.

01:31:45.958 --> 01:31:46.958
Drop it!

01:31:55.125 --> 01:31:57.291
-Move it. Walk!
-No!

01:32:23.875 --> 01:32:24.875
Don Carmelo.

01:32:24.958 --> 01:32:27.166
-Hi, Ulises. Everything okay?
-Yes, sir.

01:32:27.375 --> 01:32:29.625
I wanted to let you know
that we found Diana.

01:32:31.291 --> 01:32:33.541
-What do you mean, Diana?
-You heard right.

01:32:34.500 --> 01:32:37.875
Evaristo is bringing her over here.
We found her at the camp.

01:32:38.333 --> 01:32:40.708
-I'll see you tomorrow?
-Yes, sir.

01:32:43.208 --> 01:32:44.500
Thanks for letting me know.

01:32:59.416 --> 01:33:00.416
Come in.

01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:05.500
I see you've met my mother.

01:33:06.583 --> 01:33:09.250
-Anything else, sweetie?
-No, Mom. This is perfect.

01:33:11.958 --> 01:33:16.125
Diana, I don't know
if you're very dumb or very brave.

01:33:17.375 --> 01:33:18.750
Just like your dad.

01:33:20.291 --> 01:33:25.000
All I wanted was for us
to work in peace and harmony.

01:33:25.791 --> 01:33:29.916
You came and asked me for help with Juan.
And I helped you out of goodwill.

01:33:30.708 --> 01:33:31.708
And now look.

01:33:32.333 --> 01:33:35.416
That Estrada family is torn apart

01:33:36.291 --> 01:33:38.208
and destroyed, just like yours.

01:33:39.125 --> 01:33:42.916
It's 'cause of things like that
that your dad ended up the way he did,

01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:44.125
riddled with bullets.

01:33:47.791 --> 01:33:50.208
Don't you know what happened to your dad?

01:33:51.750 --> 01:33:52.750
Seriously?

01:33:54.916 --> 01:33:57.666
Do you actually still think
your dad was a saint?

01:33:57.750 --> 01:34:00.166
The star smuggler everyone loved?

01:34:02.250 --> 01:34:03.625
Well, not quite.

01:34:05.041 --> 01:34:07.541
Your dad begged me to give him a chance,

01:34:08.166 --> 01:34:10.375
and I helped him,
like I help everyone else.

01:34:10.958 --> 01:34:13.416
But no amount of money was enough for him.

01:34:13.791 --> 01:34:16.083
So he got involved in rougher shit.
You understand me?

01:34:16.750 --> 01:34:19.125
He started running cocaine
without my permission.

01:34:20.250 --> 01:34:22.541
Until, one day,
ambition got the better of him.

01:34:23.083 --> 01:34:25.458
He stole a shipment and got caught.

01:34:26.208 --> 01:34:27.291
And they killed him.

01:34:27.958 --> 01:34:29.875
Ugly, really ugly.

01:34:31.958 --> 01:34:32.958
Mom.

01:34:34.291 --> 01:34:35.333
What should we do?

01:34:37.625 --> 01:34:39.208
The girl's pretty, son.

01:34:40.875 --> 01:34:42.291
A bit rude.

01:34:43.250 --> 01:34:44.375
But she's pretty.

01:34:45.958 --> 01:34:48.958
Some like them like that. Feisty.

01:35:03.416 --> 01:35:05.375
Take her with the rest. Mom.

01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:09.666
Put her in a dress.
Make her look like a woman.

01:35:10.416 --> 01:35:11.250
Come on.

01:35:22.666 --> 01:35:23.791
Coming. Coming.

01:35:38.250 --> 01:35:39.708
You look like shit, Ulises.

01:35:42.250 --> 01:35:43.500
What do you want, Miguel?

01:35:44.166 --> 01:35:46.666
I heard a rumor
that you're not paying your debts.

01:35:48.208 --> 01:35:49.333
I need my commission.

01:35:49.666 --> 01:35:53.041
I don't owe you anything anymore.
Didn't you hear?

01:35:54.250 --> 01:35:59.166
The thing is, Ulisillo,
that Carmelito isn't my boss.

01:36:00.375 --> 01:36:02.500
We're just partners. Partners.

01:36:03.666 --> 01:36:04.791
My buddy.

01:36:06.166 --> 01:36:09.416
Okay, sure. We're even for the cockfights.

01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.791
But you still owe me
for covering for your brother.

01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:16.166
And you'll pay me right now.

01:36:38.166 --> 01:36:39.250
This is all I have.

01:36:47.833 --> 01:36:50.791
You smartass. Fucking asshole.

01:36:54.208 --> 01:36:57.208
-Give me the rest, now.
-I don't have any money.

01:36:57.291 --> 01:36:59.958
-I'll blow your brains out.
-I don't have any money, Miguel.

01:37:01.458 --> 01:37:03.125
I have another way of paying you.

01:37:04.833 --> 01:37:05.916
Let me show you.

01:37:30.250 --> 01:37:31.583
Yasmira.

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.083
Evelyn.

01:38:00.208 --> 01:38:01.500
You cut your hair.

01:38:05.583 --> 01:38:07.166
I saw you in a picture.

01:38:08.791 --> 01:38:09.666
Where?

01:38:11.625 --> 01:38:14.625
Your boyfriend, or your husband, I think.
I'm not sure.

01:38:15.833 --> 01:38:18.166
He brought me over from Venezuela.

01:38:23.208 --> 01:38:25.083
I liked it better before.

01:38:27.833 --> 01:38:28.958
Your hair.

01:38:33.166 --> 01:38:34.208
So did I.

01:38:37.041 --> 01:38:38.041
I'm Gabriela.

01:38:40.250 --> 01:38:41.333
Diana.

01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.333
He tried to help me.

01:38:52.833 --> 01:38:54.166
Tell me what happened.

01:38:57.208 --> 01:39:00.083
They were crossing
with me and some other kids.

01:39:01.041 --> 01:39:04.625
And he was nice to me.

01:39:04.708 --> 01:39:08.583
He gave me water.
And he drove away from the other trucks.

01:39:10.041 --> 01:39:12.416
Then his brother came and they argued.

01:39:29.291 --> 01:39:30.750
Really, Ulises?

01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:37.791
Leave, brother. Leave and never come back.

01:39:39.166 --> 01:39:41.875
-But I have to take the girl.
-You're not gonna touch her.

01:39:42.416 --> 01:39:43.583
Move it, asshole.

01:39:48.291 --> 01:39:50.291
Now I see why Angélica left you.

01:39:51.416 --> 01:39:53.333
Because you damage everything you touch.

01:39:54.958 --> 01:39:56.333
You don't act like our brother.

01:39:58.416 --> 01:40:00.500
You'll end up alone like a dog.
You hear me?

01:40:03.333 --> 01:40:04.958
Juan, I can't let her go.

01:40:06.541 --> 01:40:07.583
Juan.

01:40:08.625 --> 01:40:10.250
Juan!

01:40:18.375 --> 01:40:20.416
Juan. Juan.

01:40:21.375 --> 01:40:24.000
Juan. Juan. Juan.

01:40:24.833 --> 01:40:26.333
Juan, wake up, man.

01:40:26.708 --> 01:40:29.375
Juan. Juan. Wake up, idiot. Juan.

01:40:29.875 --> 01:40:32.791
Juan. Juan. No, brother. No.

01:40:54.375 --> 01:40:56.083
No. Let go of me!

01:40:56.291 --> 01:40:57.708
Where are you taking me?

01:41:00.791 --> 01:41:02.125
Let me go!

01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:17.666
We gotta put your brother's body
in the car. Let's light a fire.

01:41:27.583 --> 01:41:28.666
I'm sorry.

01:41:32.291 --> 01:41:33.541
He had very pretty eyes.

01:41:48.541 --> 01:41:51.500
You're full of surprises,
aren't you, Ulises?

01:41:54.416 --> 01:41:55.375
So, Ulises?

01:41:56.166 --> 01:41:59.208
Wanna make love to a lady? My treat.

01:42:07.666 --> 01:42:10.541
Don't turn down the gift, son. Go on.

01:42:15.375 --> 01:42:16.541
A drink.

01:42:25.375 --> 01:42:27.416
Diana, you've got a suitor.

01:42:31.416 --> 01:42:34.958
Don't worry. Think about something else.

01:42:35.375 --> 01:42:38.916
Think about clouds or a river flowing.

01:42:41.666 --> 01:42:42.750
You'll be fine.

01:42:44.666 --> 01:42:47.583
Diana, come on. Move it.

01:43:35.958 --> 01:43:38.208
That mouth of yours, Diana.

01:43:43.708 --> 01:43:45.375
Fucking Juan.

01:44:00.791 --> 01:44:04.291
I promise I'll try to behave
like a gentleman.

01:44:17.291 --> 01:44:18.958
You remind me of an old flame.

01:44:23.416 --> 01:44:25.416
Stubborn as a motherfucker.

01:44:40.375 --> 01:44:41.750
Sensual.

01:44:47.666 --> 01:44:50.041
Spread your legs, Diana, please.

01:45:09.791 --> 01:45:10.791
Who is it?

01:45:12.125 --> 01:45:14.916
It's me, Miguel. I got you a present.

01:47:49.166 --> 01:47:50.958
I'll get her, boss.

01:47:56.250 --> 01:47:57.875
Fucking cunt!

01:48:00.166 --> 01:48:01.791
Kill that bitch!

01:48:28.875 --> 01:48:30.375
Get down! Get down!

01:48:48.125 --> 01:48:48.958
Motherfucker!

01:49:00.166 --> 01:49:01.458
Fuck! They'll kill us!

01:50:07.083 --> 01:50:12.166
Did you know that when
we put Juan's body in the truck,

01:50:15.000 --> 01:50:16.458
he'd pissed all over himself?

01:50:20.958 --> 01:50:24.625
And that fucking Ulises
didn't want to touch him.

01:51:24.208 --> 01:51:25.375
How do we get there?

01:51:26.541 --> 01:51:28.625
It's down a path near the Boquerón exit.

01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:31.875
Next to the Venado quarry. Be careful.

01:51:32.416 --> 01:51:34.791
It's far from your territory
and Carmelo's still there.

01:51:34.958 --> 01:51:36.000
How many girls are there?

01:51:37.541 --> 01:51:40.500
About twenty women and three minors.

01:51:44.333 --> 01:51:45.458
And what are you gonna go?

01:51:48.791 --> 01:51:49.875
I don't know.

01:52:05.375 --> 01:52:06.416
Take care.
