00:42.142 --> 00:48.513
<i>Spain, 1944</i>

00:49.716 --> 00:51.084
<i>The Civil War is over.</i>

00:51.084 --> 00:53.219
<i>Hidden in the mountains,</i>

00:53.219 --> 00:55.422
<i>armed men are still fighting</i>
<i>the new Fascist regime.</i>

00:55.422 --> 00:57.686
<i>Military posts are established</i>
<i>to exterminate the Resistance.</i>

01:20.780 --> 01:24.580
A long time ago,

01:26.820 --> 01:31.621
in the Underground Realm,
where there are no lies or pain,

01:32.692 --> 01:36.685
there lived a princess who dreamt
of the human world.

01:38.698 --> 01:43.897
She dreamt of blue skies,
soft breeze and sunshine.

01:49.008 --> 01:50.202
One day,

01:50.944 --> 01:54.573
eluding her keepers,
the princess escaped.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.478
Once outside...

02:02.956 --> 02:06.585
the bright sun blinded her
and erased her memory.

02:09.529 --> 02:12.726
She forgot who she was
and where she came from.

02:13.199 --> 02:19.434
Her body suffered cold, sickness and pain.
And eventually she died.

02:20.773 --> 02:23.003
However, her father, the king,

02:23.309 --> 02:26.335
always knew that the Princess' soul
would return,

02:26.846 --> 02:28.313
perhaps in another body,

02:28.982 --> 02:31.507
in another place, at another time.

02:31.918 --> 02:35.445
He would wait for her,
until he drew his last breath,

02:35.788 --> 02:39.087
until the world stopped turning.

02:47.967 --> 02:50.458
Why did you bring
so many books, Ofelia?

02:50.637 --> 02:53.231
We're going to the country,
the outdoors.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.406
Fairy tales?

03:00.813 --> 03:04.909
You're a bit too old to be filling your head
with such nonsense.

03:07.987 --> 03:09.887
Ask him to stop the car.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.870
Ofelia, wait.

03:27.073 --> 03:29.166
Your brother's not well.

03:32.345 --> 03:33.937
Madam, are you okay?

04:40.780 --> 04:41.747
Ofelia?

04:44.150 --> 04:47.051
Ofelia, Come here.

04:50.256 --> 04:53.487
- I saw a fairy.
- Just look at your shoes!

04:54.727 --> 04:55.716
Let's go.

04:56.863 --> 04:59.764
When we get to the mill,
come out to greet the Captain.

04:59.999 --> 05:01.830
I want you to call him Father.

05:02.268 --> 05:04.702
You have no idea
how good he's been to us.

05:06.105 --> 05:09.404
It's just a word, Ofelia...
just a word...

05:35.335 --> 05:37.064
They're coming, Captain.

05:38.071 --> 05:39.561
15 minutes late.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.683
Carmen.

06:06.165 --> 06:07.462
Welcome.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.705
That's not necessary.
I can walk perfectly well.

06:15.174 --> 06:17.642
Doctor Ferreiro prefers
that you don't exert yourself.

06:18.378 --> 06:19.208
No.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.249
Come.
Do it for me.

06:29.489 --> 06:30.513
Thank you.

06:32.425 --> 06:33.551
Ofelia, come out.

06:34.460 --> 06:35.654
Say hello to the Captain.

06:40.733 --> 06:41.757
Ofelia.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.104
It's the other hand, Ofelia.

06:56.048 --> 06:57.072
Mercedes!

06:58.351 --> 07:01.184
- Bring the luggage.
- Sir.

08:06.886 --> 08:08.444
It's a labyrinth.

08:11.991 --> 08:14.516
Just a pile of old rocks
that have always been here.

08:15.261 --> 08:16.819
Even before the mill.

08:17.930 --> 08:20.831
Better not to go in there.
You may get lost.

08:21.467 --> 08:22.661
Thank you.

08:23.202 --> 08:24.533
Have you read them all?

08:25.037 --> 08:25.969
Mercedes!

08:28.074 --> 08:29.063
The Captain is calling.

08:31.611 --> 08:32.736
Your father needs me.

08:35.681 --> 08:36.807
He's not my father.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.241
The Captain is not my father.

08:39.418 --> 08:42.751
My father was a tailor.
He died in the war.

08:42.889 --> 08:44.220
He's not my father.

08:45.591 --> 08:48.059
You've made that clear enough.
Shall we go?

08:48.895 --> 08:50.556
Have you seen my mother?

08:51.030 --> 08:52.622
- Isn't she beautiful!
- Yes.

08:53.065 --> 08:55.431
She's sick with baby.
Did you notice?

09:13.286 --> 09:15.083
The guerrillas are sticking
to the woods

09:15.388 --> 09:17.185
because it's hard
to track them up there.

09:18.391 --> 09:20.655
Those bastards know the terrain
better than any of us.

09:20.826 --> 09:22.487
We'll block all access
to the woods

09:23.863 --> 09:26.923
Food, medicine-
we'll store it all. Right here.

09:27.133 --> 09:30.000
We need to force them down,
make them come to us.

09:30.336 --> 09:32.065
We'll set up three
new command posts.

09:32.238 --> 09:35.833
Here, here and here.

09:36.008 --> 09:37.032
Mercedes.

09:38.311 --> 09:40.836
- Ask Dr. Ferreiro to come down.
- Yes, sir.

09:45.518 --> 09:47.645
This will help you sleep
through the night.

09:48.955 --> 09:51.446
Just two drops just before bed.

09:54.694 --> 09:55.786
Two drops only.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.161
Very good.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.330
All of it.
Good.

10:05.838 --> 10:09.296
Don't hesitate to call me
if you need anything. Day or night.

10:11.711 --> 10:13.941
You or your nurse.

10:14.747 --> 10:15.736
Good night.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.281
Close the door
and turn off the lights, sweetie.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.426
You have to help us.
Come up and see him.

10:33.666 --> 10:36.897
The wound is getting worse.
His leg isn't any better.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.838
This is all I could get.

10:43.075 --> 10:44.064
I'm sorry.

10:45.945 --> 10:47.970
Captain Vidal is waiting
for you in his office.

11:14.040 --> 11:15.473
Come here, Ofelia.

11:27.687 --> 11:30.918
Jesus, your feet.
They're frozen!

11:40.900 --> 11:41.924
Are you afraid?

11:44.136 --> 11:45.160
A little.

11:50.242 --> 11:51.368
What's that noise?

11:51.477 --> 11:54.571
Nothing, just the wind.

11:56.048 --> 11:59.245
Nights here are different
from city nights.

12:00.186 --> 12:03.212
There, you hear cars-tramway.

12:03.756 --> 12:05.621
Here the houses are old.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.382
They creak.

12:10.963 --> 12:12.328
As if they were speaking.

12:16.368 --> 12:18.802
Tomorrow, I'm going
to give you a surprise.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.164
- A surprise?
- Yes.

12:22.708 --> 12:27.145
- A book?
- No, something much better.

12:33.119 --> 12:35.087
Why did you have to get married?

12:39.325 --> 12:41.657
I was alone too long.

12:42.261 --> 12:45.389
I'm with you.
You weren't alone.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.922
You were never alone.

12:50.402 --> 12:54.133
When you're older, you'll understand.
It hasn't been easy for me either.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.711
Your brother's at it again-

13:00.579 --> 13:02.706
Tell him one of your stories.

13:03.249 --> 13:04.944
I'm sure that'll calm down.

13:07.920 --> 13:11.412
My brother, my brother...

13:16.562 --> 13:19.030
Many, many years ago,

13:19.398 --> 13:21.764
in a sad, faraway land,

13:21.867 --> 13:25.598
there was an enormous mountain
made of rough, black stone.

13:26.272 --> 13:27.933
At sunset,

13:28.607 --> 13:30.871
on top of that mountain,

13:31.110 --> 13:35.547
a magic rose blossomed every night
that made whoever plucked it immortal.

13:35.881 --> 13:39.317
But no one dared go near it

13:39.785 --> 13:42.948
because its thorns were full of poison.

13:52.264 --> 13:56.758
Men talked amongst themselves
about their fear of death,

13:56.836 --> 14:01.466
and pain, but never about the promise
of eternal life.

14:05.511 --> 14:13.384
And every day, the rose wilted
unable to bequeath its gift to anyone.

14:15.254 --> 14:19.850
Forgotten and lost at the top
of that cold, dark mountain,

14:20.492 --> 14:23.586
forever alone, until the end of time.

14:36.508 --> 14:37.440
Come in.

14:40.946 --> 14:42.743
- How is she?
- Very weak.

14:43.349 --> 14:44.714
She'll have as much rest
as as she needs.

14:44.917 --> 14:46.009
I'll sleep down here.

14:51.190 --> 14:52.680
- And my son?
- Pardon?

14:52.992 --> 14:54.823
Excuse us, Captain.

14:56.862 --> 14:58.921
My son, how is he?

14:59.698 --> 15:01.598
For the moment, there's no
reason to be alarmed.

15:03.802 --> 15:04.700
Very good.

15:06.639 --> 15:11.599
Captain, your wife should not have
traveled at such a late stage of pregnancy.

15:14.780 --> 15:18.546
- Is that your opinion?
- My professional opinion, yes, sir.

15:21.720 --> 15:24.154
A son should be born
wherever his father is.

15:24.657 --> 15:25.681
That's all.

15:28.193 --> 15:29.626
One more thing, Captain.

15:30.629 --> 15:32.654
What makes you so sure
the baby is a male?

15:34.967 --> 15:35.934
Don't fuck with me.

15:37.736 --> 15:40.398
At 8 o'clock we detected movement
in the northwestern sector.

15:41.140 --> 15:41.902
Gunfire.

15:45.110 --> 15:48.204
Sergeant Bayona searched the area
and captured a suspect.

15:49.081 --> 15:50.912
The other one's his son,
here from the town.

15:50.983 --> 15:53.383
Captain, my father
is an honest man.

15:53.519 --> 15:56.511
Let me judge that.
Take your hat off in front of me.

15:57.523 --> 16:00.185
We found this weapon on him.
It's been fired.

16:00.392 --> 16:02.087
My father was hunting
rabbits, Captain.

16:02.161 --> 16:03.719
Again, keep quiet.

16:14.406 --> 16:16.067
"No God, no country, no Master"?

16:16.542 --> 16:20.672
- Just like that-how do you like that?
- Red prpaganda, Captain.

16:20.813 --> 16:22.610
It's not propaganda, sir.

16:23.315 --> 16:25.613
It's an old almanac, Captain.

16:26.652 --> 16:28.313
We're just farmers.

16:29.922 --> 16:30.752
Go on.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.757
I went up into the woods, Captain.
To hunt for rabbits.

16:36.395 --> 16:38.522
For my daughters. They're sick.

16:40.132 --> 16:41.599
Rabbits, uh?

16:42.001 --> 16:45.801
Captain, if my father says so,
he was hunting rabbits.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.877
Leave him alone.

17:01.820 --> 17:05.085
You killed him,
You killed him!

17:05.590 --> 17:08.583
Murderer!
Son of a bitch!

17:38.357 --> 17:40.518
Maybe you'll learn to search
these assholes properly

17:40.793 --> 17:42.351
before you come bothering me.

17:42.628 --> 17:43.788
Yes, Captain.

18:04.049 --> 18:07.485
Mother.
Mother, wake up!

18:07.986 --> 18:11.251
Mother, there's something in the room.

18:52.664 --> 18:53.596
Hello.

18:54.466 --> 18:55.990
Did you follow me here?

18:56.768 --> 18:57.928
Are you a fairy?

19:00.405 --> 19:01.269
Look!

19:06.612 --> 19:08.102
This is a fairy.

19:35.908 --> 19:37.569
You want me to go with you?

19:39.178 --> 19:41.612
Outside? Where?

20:59.625 --> 21:01.286
Hello?

21:02.661 --> 21:04.185
Hello?

21:22.247 --> 21:24.340
Echo.

21:31.356 --> 21:33.381
Echo.

21:36.261 --> 21:38.354
Hello?

21:41.199 --> 21:42.723
Hello?

21:45.337 --> 21:46.634
It's you.

21:51.777 --> 21:55.110
It's you.
You've returned.

21:55.213 --> 21:57.238
Don't be frightened,
I beg you.

21:58.583 --> 22:00.517
Look, look.

22:08.794 --> 22:11.422
My name is Ofelia.
Who are you?

22:11.563 --> 22:12.723
Me?

22:15.300 --> 22:17.768
I've had so many names...

22:17.969 --> 22:25.967
Old names that only the wind
and the trees can pronounce.

22:26.144 --> 22:32.982
I am the mountain,
the forest and the earth.

22:33.785 --> 22:35.082
I am...

22:38.557 --> 22:41.355
I am a faun.

22:42.127 --> 22:46.154
Your most humble servant,
Your Highness.

22:46.298 --> 22:49.927
- No, I'm...
- You're Princess Moanna,

22:50.035 --> 22:55.701
daughter of the king
of the underworld.

22:55.774 --> 22:57.503
My father was a tailor.

22:57.609 --> 22:59.736
You are not born of man.

23:00.779 --> 23:03.213
It was the moon that bore you.

23:03.382 --> 23:05.680
Look on your left shoulder

23:05.851 --> 23:08.820
and you will find a mark
that proves it.

23:09.254 --> 23:19.220
Your real father had us open portals
all over the world to allow your return.

23:19.698 --> 23:21.359
This is...

23:22.000 --> 23:24.594
This is the last of them.

23:25.237 --> 23:33.838
But we have to make sure
that your essence is intact,

23:34.346 --> 23:38.476
that you have not become a mortal.

23:42.053 --> 23:47.685
You must complete three tasks
before the moon is full.

23:50.629 --> 23:56.659
This is The Book of Crossroads.

23:57.369 --> 24:00.497
Open it, when you are alone

24:00.639 --> 24:03.540
and it will show you your future,

24:03.642 --> 24:07.976
show you what must be done.

24:16.354 --> 24:17.912
But there's nothing in here.

25:14.880 --> 25:18.441
Mercedes, prepare these rabbits
for dinner tonight.

25:19.451 --> 25:21.476
They are too young.

25:21.987 --> 25:25.047
- Well, maybe they'll do for a stew.
- Yes, sir.

25:27.526 --> 25:30.518
This coffee was burnt.
Taste it yourself.

25:38.970 --> 25:41.803
You should keep an eye on it.

25:43.608 --> 25:45.041
As you wish, sir.

25:51.583 --> 25:52.572
Cook these.

25:54.352 --> 25:56.820
- He didn't like the coffee.
- He's nothing but a fussy dandy.

25:56.955 --> 25:57.856
A fussy dandy!

25:57.856 --> 26:00.158
We're going to need some beef
and one more chicken.

26:00.158 --> 26:03.992
- Where are we supposed to find that?
- The doctor's wife, the mayor's too.

26:04.062 --> 26:07.054
Well, they eat more
than a couple of pigs.

26:08.166 --> 26:11.727
- And they don't shut up.
- Not even underwater.

26:26.685 --> 26:28.710
I'll be back in a moment,
Mercedes.

26:33.825 --> 26:35.087
Ofelia.

26:37.662 --> 26:40.392
Your father is giving
a dinner party tonight.

26:40.799 --> 26:43.632
Look what I've made for you.

26:45.070 --> 26:46.264
Do you like it?

26:48.073 --> 26:51.065
What I wouldn't have given
to have such a dress...

26:51.209 --> 26:53.643
as fine as this when I was your age!

26:53.812 --> 26:54.938
And look at the shoes!

26:56.314 --> 26:59.010
- Do you like them?
- Yes, very pretty.

27:00.652 --> 27:02.313
Go on, now.
Take your bath.

28:06.685 --> 28:07.674
Ofelia?

28:09.454 --> 28:10.318
Ofelia?

28:11.756 --> 28:15.214
Hurry up.
I want to see the dress on you.

28:15.493 --> 28:18.053
I want you to be beautiful
for the Captain.

28:20.899 --> 28:22.662
You'll look like a princess.

28:27.072 --> 28:28.471
A princess?

28:34.813 --> 28:36.542
Make sure those chickens
are cleaned properly.

28:36.648 --> 28:39.116
And don't forget the beans.

28:42.353 --> 28:46.722
- You look marvelous, my girl, just beautiful.
- What a gorgeous dress!

28:49.160 --> 28:51.651
Get back to work,
stop wasting time.

28:54.466 --> 28:55.933
Do you want some milk with honey?

29:01.473 --> 29:05.432
Move back, we can't have you getting
milk on your dress, with you looking so pretty.

29:07.812 --> 29:11.748
Mercedes.
Do you believe in fairies?

29:12.884 --> 29:13.782
No.

29:14.586 --> 29:15.951
But when I was a little girl,
I did.

29:16.020 --> 29:18.614
I believed in a lot of things
I don't believe any more.

29:21.025 --> 29:22.754
Last night,
a fairy visited me.

29:23.762 --> 29:24.820
Really?

29:26.064 --> 29:29.200
And it wasn't alone,
there were lots of them,

29:29.200 --> 29:30.895
- And a faun, too.
- A faun?

29:31.169 --> 29:35.128
He was very old, very tall
and smelled like earth.

29:36.174 --> 29:39.200
My mother warned me
to be wary of fauns.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.502
Mercedes!

29:42.447 --> 29:43.414
Come with me.

29:54.092 --> 29:55.889
Captain,
everything is here.

29:56.127 --> 29:58.823
Flour, salt, oil, medicine,

29:58.997 --> 30:02.125
olives, bacon.

30:03.234 --> 30:05.099
This-this is real tobacco.

30:06.070 --> 30:07.469
And the ration cards.

30:07.839 --> 30:10.171
- I need you to check the inventory.
- Very well.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.669
Mercedes.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.575
- The key.
- Yes, sir.

30:24.923 --> 30:26.857
- Is this the only copy?
- The only one.

30:26.958 --> 30:28.755
From now on, I'll carry it.

30:29.694 --> 30:30.626
Captain.

30:36.401 --> 30:37.993
Captain,
perhaps it's nothing.

30:46.411 --> 30:47.400
It's them.

30:59.090 --> 31:03.151
"Once upon a time,
when the forest was young,

31:03.728 --> 31:09.360
they were home to creatures
who were full of magic and wonder."

31:16.174 --> 31:18.506
"They protected one another,

31:18.810 --> 31:21.973
and slept in the shade
of a colossal fig tree

31:22.413 --> 31:24.847
that grew on a hill, near the mill."

31:27.385 --> 31:29.148
"But now, the tree is dying.

31:29.487 --> 31:33.150
Its branches are dry,
its trunk old and twisted.

31:33.958 --> 31:37.189
A monstrous toad
has settled in its roots

31:37.462 --> 31:38.929
and won't let the tree thrive.

31:40.231 --> 31:43.428
You must put the three magic
stones in the toad's mouth

31:44.102 --> 31:47.560
and retrieve the golden key
from inside his belly.

31:48.172 --> 31:51.335
Only then will the fig tree
flourish again."

33:17.862 --> 33:19.659
They were here
less than twenty minutes ago.

33:20.465 --> 33:22.296
They left in a hurry.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.340
A dozen men, at most.

33:50.261 --> 33:51.626
Antibiotics.

33:52.597 --> 33:55.760
Shit, they forgot this lottery ticket.

33:58.102 --> 33:59.296
They're here.

34:02.273 --> 34:04.639
Those sons of bitches are here.

34:05.510 --> 34:07.637
And they're watching us.

34:17.588 --> 34:19.283
Hey!

34:20.625 --> 34:23.116
You left this behind!

34:23.860 --> 34:25.851
And your lottery ticket!

34:26.397 --> 34:28.489
Why don't you come back
and get it?

34:29.233 --> 34:31.701
Who knows?
This could be your lucky day!

35:42.840 --> 35:46.401
Hello.
I'm Princess Moanna,

35:46.777 --> 35:48.244
and I'm not afraid of you.

35:51.716 --> 35:54.947
Aren't you ashamed
living down here,

35:55.153 --> 35:57.178
eating all these bugs...

35:57.955 --> 36:00.890
and growing fat
while the tree dies?

38:43.788 --> 38:45.813
Have you looked in her room?
And the pantry?

38:45.956 --> 38:47.218
Yes, ma'am.

38:50.828 --> 38:52.420
Have you checked the garden?

38:52.763 --> 38:54.560
- And the barn?
- Yes, ma'am.

38:55.399 --> 38:56.991
Where is that girl?

38:57.068 --> 38:58.365
This way, please.

38:59.403 --> 39:02.395
Let me to introduce you
to my wife, Carmen.

39:04.275 --> 39:06.140
- Charmed.
- A pleasure to meet you.

39:06.744 --> 39:10.043
From now on,
one ration card per family.

39:10.815 --> 39:11.782
Take a look.

39:11.916 --> 39:14.111
- One?
- Only one.

39:14.885 --> 39:16.682
Captain, I'm not sure
it'll be enough.

39:16.754 --> 39:18.085
If people are careful,
it should be plenty.

39:18.155 --> 39:21.352
We can't allow anyone to send food
to the guerillas in the mountains.

39:21.492 --> 39:25.360
They're losing ground,
and one of them is wounded.

39:26.230 --> 39:28.966
Excuse me, Captain,
how can you be so sure?

39:28.966 --> 39:31.696
We almost got them.
We found this.

39:32.503 --> 39:33.731
Antibiotics.

39:34.972 --> 39:37.338
God has already
saved their souls.

39:37.608 --> 39:40.236
What happens to their bodies
hardly matter to Him.

39:40.411 --> 39:42.902
We'll help however we can, Captain.

39:43.013 --> 39:45.174
We know you're not here by choice.

39:49.553 --> 39:50.611
You're wrong about that.

39:51.822 --> 39:55.690
I choose to be here because I want
my son to be born in a new, clean Spain.

39:56.660 --> 39:59.754
Because these people
hold the mistaken belief

40:00.030 --> 40:01.588
that we're all equal.

40:02.199 --> 40:03.666
But there's a big difference:

40:04.268 --> 40:06.793
The war is over and we won.

40:07.405 --> 40:10.340
And if we need to kill every one
of these vermin to settle it,

40:11.342 --> 40:13.503
then we'll kill them all,
and that's that.

40:14.745 --> 40:16.269
We're all here by choice.

40:17.281 --> 40:19.476
By choice!

40:22.386 --> 40:25.184
Put the coffee on.
I'm going for more wood.

40:25.322 --> 40:27.313
We'll take care of it.

40:54.318 --> 40:55.444
Ofelia?

41:07.465 --> 41:10.332
So, how did you
and the Captain meet?

41:12.770 --> 41:15.568
Ofelia's father used to make
the Captain's uniforms.

41:15.706 --> 41:16.673
Oh, I see...

41:17.208 --> 41:21.406
And after he died,
I went to work at the shop.

41:21.545 --> 41:23.740
A little more than a year ago,

41:24.648 --> 41:28.448
the Captain and I met again.

41:28.619 --> 41:30.109
Curious, isn't it!

41:30.387 --> 41:33.356
I mean, finding each other again?

41:34.892 --> 41:37.554
Oh, yes,
very, very curious.

41:37.828 --> 41:41.525
Please, forgive my wife.
She hasn't been exposed to the world.

41:42.032 --> 41:44.262
She thinks these silly stories
are interesting to others.

41:45.436 --> 41:46.960
We understand.

41:49.373 --> 41:51.534
Excuse me, madam
Ofelia is here.

41:52.276 --> 41:53.675
Excuse me.

42:04.622 --> 42:06.817
Have I told you that I was acquainted
with your father, Captain?

42:07.992 --> 42:09.459
No.
I had no idea.

42:12.196 --> 42:13.686
In Morocco.

42:14.098 --> 42:17.067
I knew him only briefly,
but he left a great impression.

42:17.134 --> 42:18.328
An excellent soldier.

42:18.802 --> 42:23.102
The men in his battalion said that
when General Vidal died on the battlefield,

42:23.908 --> 42:25.569
he smashed his watch on a rock

42:25.776 --> 42:28.267
so that his son would know
the exact hour and minute of his death.

42:29.380 --> 42:31.712
So he would know
how a brave man dies.

42:34.785 --> 42:37.310
Nonsense.
He didn't own a watch.

42:38.923 --> 42:42.120
What you've done hurts me.

42:43.661 --> 42:46.255
After your bath,
you'll go to bed without supper.

42:48.265 --> 42:49.357
Are you listening?

42:52.836 --> 42:55.600
Sometimes I think
you'll never learn to behave.

42:56.473 --> 42:58.464
You've disappointed me, Ofelia.

43:00.544 --> 43:01.943
And your father, too.

43:03.414 --> 43:04.676
You mean the Captain?

43:05.816 --> 43:07.113
Him more than me.

43:22.566 --> 43:23.999
I've got the key.

43:27.738 --> 43:29.365
Take me to the Labyrinth.

44:22.626 --> 44:23.615
Hello.

44:25.429 --> 44:27.226
I got the key out.

44:28.298 --> 44:33.167
That's me,
and the girl is you.

44:33.504 --> 44:34.698
And the baby?

44:36.073 --> 44:38.303
So... you retrieved the key.

44:41.078 --> 44:42.340
I'm glad.

44:50.988 --> 44:55.288
She believed in you
from the very beginning.

44:55.659 --> 44:58.355
She's so glad you succeeded.

45:04.401 --> 45:05.800
Keep the key.

45:06.236 --> 45:09.399
You'll be needing it very soon.

45:09.573 --> 45:14.476
And this too?
A piece of chalk.

45:15.913 --> 45:19.183
Two tasks remain

45:19.183 --> 45:24.018
and the moon is almost full.

45:24.121 --> 45:25.918
Be patient.

45:26.190 --> 45:34.894
We'll soon stroll through
the seven circular gardens of your palace.

45:34.998 --> 45:37.523
How do I know
that what you say is true?

45:37.835 --> 45:43.774
Why would a poor little faun
like me lie to you?

46:05.896 --> 46:07.090
Proceed.

46:08.132 --> 46:10.566
Have your cards
ready for inspection.

46:10.801 --> 46:13.361
Let's go.
Your name?

46:17.107 --> 46:18.597
Your names, first and last.

46:19.076 --> 46:23.240
Narciso Pena Soriano,
at your service.

46:26.750 --> 46:28.980
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain,

46:29.219 --> 46:33.315
kept safe in this mill!
The Reds lie...

46:33.690 --> 46:35.351
because in a united Spain,

46:35.526 --> 46:39.223
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

46:53.443 --> 46:57.004
Come on, show me
what happens now?

46:57.514 --> 46:58.538
Show me.

47:36.587 --> 47:38.179
Ofelia, help me...

47:44.027 --> 47:45.892
Captain! Captain!

47:48.465 --> 47:50.023
Come quickly.

47:50.567 --> 47:51.864
...because in a united Spain,

47:51.969 --> 47:55.837
there's not a single home
without fire or bread.

47:56.306 --> 47:58.638
This is our daily bread
in Franco's Spain...

48:01.545 --> 48:04.514
Your wife needs
uninterrupted rest.

48:06.383 --> 48:09.284
She'll have to be sedated
most of the time.

48:11.521 --> 48:13.853
The girl should sleep
somewhere else.

48:15.626 --> 48:17.685
I'll stay here until the birth.

48:18.161 --> 48:19.128
Make her well.

48:20.464 --> 48:22.489
I don't care what it costs
or what you need.

48:27.204 --> 48:27.898
Make her well.

48:49.226 --> 48:50.693
Don't worry.

48:51.862 --> 48:54.353
Your mother will get better soon,
you'll see.

48:57.734 --> 48:59.361
Having a baby is complicated.

49:00.170 --> 49:03.333
Then I'll never have one.

49:15.886 --> 49:18.719
You're helping the men
in the woods, aren't you?

49:30.367 --> 49:31.698
Have you told anyone?

49:33.270 --> 49:34.396
No, I haven't.

49:36.606 --> 49:38.699
I don't want anything bad
to happen to you.

49:49.619 --> 49:50.881
Nor I to you.

49:52.422 --> 49:54.549
Do you know a lullaby?

49:56.526 --> 49:57.754
Only one...

49:58.895 --> 50:00.920
but I don't remember the words.

50:01.231 --> 50:04.826
I don't care.
I still want to hear it.

50:58.188 --> 51:00.952
Don't be afraid.
It's only me.

51:09.900 --> 51:11.868
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

51:13.036 --> 51:14.162
Then let's go.

51:19.176 --> 51:20.643
This is sheer madness.

51:21.011 --> 51:23.445
When that man finds out about us,
he'll kill us all.

51:23.947 --> 51:27.075
- Have you thought about that?
- Are you so afraid of him, Doctor?

51:27.484 --> 51:29.452
It's not fear...

51:30.053 --> 51:31.418
at least not for myself.

51:43.200 --> 51:44.599
Pedro!

51:44.901 --> 51:47.335
Pedro, My brother!

52:03.987 --> 52:06.148
You didn't carry out the task.

52:06.289 --> 52:09.588
No, my mother is sick.

52:11.128 --> 52:13.722
That's no excuse
for negligence.

52:13.997 --> 52:18.866
Look...
this is a mandrake root.

52:18.969 --> 52:22.837
A plant that dreamt
of being human.

52:23.773 --> 52:28.437
Put it under your mother's bed

52:28.812 --> 52:32.043
in a bowl of fresh milk.

52:32.649 --> 52:37.609
Each morning,
give it two drops of blood.

52:38.054 --> 52:42.115
Now, we have no time
to waste.

52:42.425 --> 52:45.189
The full moon will be upon us.

52:47.564 --> 52:50.032
Take my pets
to guide you through.

52:50.634 --> 52:56.231
You're going to a very dangerous
place, so be careful.

52:56.439 --> 52:59.203
The thing that slumbers there,

53:00.110 --> 53:02.635
it is not human.

53:06.483 --> 53:10.749
You will see
a sumptuous feast,

53:10.854 --> 53:13.652
but don't eat
or drink anything.

53:13.857 --> 53:18.590
Absolutely nothing.

53:20.263 --> 53:23.790
Your life depends on it.

53:44.454 --> 53:49.414
I've brought some Orujo,
tobacco, cheese.

53:50.126 --> 53:52.492
Mail for Trigo and Piloto.

53:54.564 --> 53:56.532
Let's see how that leg's doing,
Frenchie.

53:57.100 --> 54:00.536
How do you think it's doing?
It's fucked up.

54:01.004 --> 54:02.596
Let's see.

54:05.675 --> 54:08.940
...N- North American,

54:10.313 --> 54:12.975
British and Canadian troops

54:13.083 --> 54:16.610
disembarked on a small beach
in the North of F-F.

54:17.454 --> 54:20.150
- "France", idiot.
- F-f-f-rance.

54:20.557 --> 54:23.048
More than 150,000 soldiers
give us hope...

54:23.293 --> 54:28.094
under the command
of General Dwight D. Eisenhower...

54:28.298 --> 54:31.267
Is it really bad, doctor?

54:32.302 --> 54:33.929
Look, Frenchie.

54:35.205 --> 54:36.763
There's no way to save it.

54:48.652 --> 54:51.951
I'll try to make it
in as few cuts as possible.

54:59.729 --> 55:03.130
Wait a second, doctor,
just a second.

55:38.234 --> 55:44.400
"Use the chalk to trace a door
anywhere in your room."

55:49.579 --> 55:53.538
"Once the door's open,
start the hourglass."
