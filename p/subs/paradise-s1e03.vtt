WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:04.253
-  <i>If that stuff happens--
-  It's going to happen.</i>

00:04.254 --> 00:07.339
- So, what do we do?
- You dig the biggest hole you can

00:07.340 --> 00:08.717
and you get in.

00:11.594 --> 00:14.138
We are preparing
for a massive catastrophe

00:14.139 --> 00:16.015
<i>that could cause
an extinction-level event for humanity</i>

00:16.016 --> 00:17.433
<i>in the very real future.</i>

00:17.434 --> 00:20.145
<i>Wildcat is down. It's a code red.</i>

00:20.729 --> 00:23.397
It's really bad,
and I need you here five minutes ago.

00:23.398 --> 00:25.024
Copy you, I'm on my way.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.984
All security cameras were offline

00:26.985 --> 00:30.029
frozen on the last image,
but no one noticed because--

00:30.030 --> 00:31.488
No one else was in the house
except Billy,

00:31.489 --> 00:33.365
and he was
dead to the world on that couch.

00:33.366 --> 00:36.745
Jane, everything's gonna be
looked at from here on out.

00:37.328 --> 00:38.580
<i>I need you to trust me.</i>

00:39.289 --> 00:41.540
Agent Collins, I'm gonna
need you to come with me.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.876
I just don't understand
why of all the people

00:43.877 --> 00:45.794
that could be heading this up,
they chose the one person

00:45.795 --> 00:48.255
<i>who was sleeping with the victim.</i>

00:48.256 --> 00:49.965
This is Dr. Gabriela Torabi.

00:49.966 --> 00:52.676
She's a world-class therapist
and grief specialist.

00:52.677 --> 00:54.303
Do you remember me?

00:54.304 --> 00:55.846
You're we're the president's therapist.

00:55.847 --> 00:57.223
I was yours too.

00:57.807 --> 01:01.895
Uh, we did one session together early on.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.190
I have just one other question
for you, if I may.

01:06.191 --> 01:08.484
Is a part of you happy that Cal is dead?

01:13.573 --> 01:14.824
Yes.

02:19.556 --> 02:20.848
Slow down, dude.

02:21.933 --> 02:23.600
Dude, slow down. I'm--
I'm gonna pass out.

02:23.601 --> 02:25.435
- You're not gonna pass out.
- Yes, I am.

02:25.436 --> 02:27.438
I'm gonna throw up
and I'm gonna fucking pass out.

02:28.648 --> 02:30.065
Remind me why we're doing this again.

02:30.066 --> 02:32.276
Billy, if you're gonna be my eyes
and ears on this thing

02:32.277 --> 02:34.528
when we meet up, it's gotta look normal.

02:34.529 --> 02:37.239
Us having a beer
at a fuckin' bar looks normal.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.533
There's too many people at a bar.

02:39.534 --> 02:41.160
- Jesus Christ.
- Alright, come on, come on.

02:41.161 --> 02:42.870
Just walk it out.

02:48.042 --> 02:50.502
You should be the one in charge
of this investigation, X.

02:50.503 --> 02:51.920
Ship has already sailed.

02:51.921 --> 02:54.214
Yeah, but why are you
public enemy number one?

02:54.215 --> 02:55.507
I fell asleep on the couch.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.509
Brooks and Rainey and Jane
were all on site,

02:57.510 --> 02:59.678
it's worth mentioning
Robinson was boning the guy.

02:59.679 --> 03:03.265
POTUS got hit and I didn't call it in
for over 30 minutes.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.268
Plus, I was the last person
to see him alive.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.188
It is weird that he's gone.

03:09.480 --> 03:12.025
I mean, he was a motherfucker,
but he was our motherfucker, right?

03:14.944 --> 03:17.487
- I mean, I know you hated him.
- I didn't hate him.

03:17.488 --> 03:20.200
- It's complicated.
- Yeah.

03:22.160 --> 03:23.911
Why don't we just tell
everybody the truth?

03:23.912 --> 03:25.746
What, that POTUS was murdered?

03:25.747 --> 03:27.247
And that his tablet
with government secrets

03:27.248 --> 03:28.999
and God knows what else is missing,

03:29.000 --> 03:32.921
and that we think the people
that built this place are covering it up?

03:33.963 --> 03:35.589
I mean, I'd tune in.

03:35.590 --> 03:37.674
I need you to be careful, Billy.

03:37.675 --> 03:40.178
- It's not really my thing, but--
- I know, man.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.139
- But try.
- Alright.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.391
Uh...

03:46.392 --> 03:48.769
7:15 mile, Agent Pace. Not bad.

03:48.770 --> 03:51.396
You keep that up
and you may just lose them titties.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.065
You mean these beefy pecs?

03:53.066 --> 03:55.776
I dunno, man, they look like
some big ol' titties to me.

03:55.777 --> 03:58.321
Where are you off to?

03:59.322 --> 04:01.824
- Seeing a therapist.
- Alright.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.111
Just a second.

04:41.155 --> 04:42.864
Dr. Torabi.

04:42.865 --> 04:45.158
- Agent Collins.
- Bad time?

04:45.159 --> 04:48.288
Um, n-no. No, not at all.

04:49.289 --> 04:53.543
Oh, I, I was just playing
a little game of 52 pickup.

04:54.544 --> 04:55.920
Looks messy.

04:57.588 --> 04:59.089
I think I have a guess
as to why you're here.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.009
Why did you tell me to say yes?

05:02.635 --> 05:04.678
Agent Collins, if you'd like
to schedule an appointment,

05:04.679 --> 05:06.638
I'd be more than happy to set up a time--

05:06.639 --> 05:08.266
It's a simple question, Doctor.

05:15.648 --> 05:17.025
I'm headed out.

05:19.110 --> 05:20.570
Care to join me for a walk?

05:22.488 --> 05:23.614
Sure.

05:24.699 --> 05:25.950
Great.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.432
The deceased is a white male.

05:50.433 --> 05:54.479
There's a right ZMC fracture
with a severe orbital blowout.

05:56.022 --> 05:59.817
Sorry, I'm a bit out of practice.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.403
Continuing on to the second injury.

06:03.404 --> 06:06.740
There's comminution
of the orbital parietal bones...

06:06.741 --> 06:09.159
<i>...cerebral sagittal sinus,</i>

06:09.160 --> 06:11.079
<i>evidence of blunt force trauma.</i>

06:12.288 --> 06:14.331
Preliminary wound analysis
suggest the murder weapon

06:14.332 --> 06:17.834
was some sort of heavy object,
something jagged.

06:17.835 --> 06:20.629
There are samples
of what appear to be soil

06:20.630 --> 06:24.509
from an area around the head wound,
likely indicating a large rock.

06:26.094 --> 06:28.596
He was first hit
on his right side while standing.

06:29.263 --> 06:32.265
The catastrophic fracture
to the top of his cranium

06:32.266 --> 06:34.142
likely happened while
he was on the ground,

06:34.143 --> 06:35.977
very likely defenseless.

06:35.978 --> 06:38.480
That said, there are signs
of ecchymosis on his hands.

06:38.481 --> 06:42.025
Contusions, bruising, signs of a struggle.

06:42.026 --> 06:44.986
And you have swabbed
his fingernails for traces of DNA?

06:44.987 --> 06:46.696
I did.

06:46.697 --> 06:49.616
How long before any DNA results come back?

06:49.617 --> 06:51.118
Our tech is limited down here

06:51.119 --> 06:52.828
and we're out of practice,
as I said, but it--

06:52.829 --> 06:53.996
How long?

06:55.415 --> 06:56.665
A day or two.

07:51.179 --> 07:54.974
It's still amazing to me
how resilient human beings can be.

07:56.017 --> 08:00.729
It's been three years, and this place
has become our normal.

08:00.730 --> 08:03.273
And trust me, it took a lot of work
to get it to feel this way.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.736
The insect sounds.

08:07.737 --> 08:10.447
Those are a particularly nice touch.

08:10.448 --> 08:13.617
The recordings were done in national parks
all over the country.

08:13.618 --> 08:17.078
Why are we walking?
You think someone bugged your office?

08:17.079 --> 08:19.539
They recorded every insect
they could find.

08:19.540 --> 08:23.043
Thousands of hours. Day, night, uh, dusk.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.836
- Dr. Torabi.
- Yes, maybe.

08:24.837 --> 08:27.715
- Who?
- Who do you think?

08:29.175 --> 08:30.635
Sinatra and the billionaires.

08:31.802 --> 08:33.679
Sounds like a rock band, doesn't it?

08:35.139 --> 08:40.060
Agent Collins, how well
do you remember our first meeting?

08:40.061 --> 08:42.271
- To be honest, not very.
- Hm.

08:43.272 --> 08:47.651
Agent Xavier Collins,
the first patient I'd ever seen

08:47.652 --> 08:50.071
take the Fifth in therapy.

08:51.113 --> 08:53.448
I remember I asked you
about your background,

08:53.449 --> 08:56.451
and then, uh,
I distinctly remember you saying,

08:56.452 --> 08:58.662
"I plead the Fifth,"
and you weren't being funny either.

08:58.663 --> 09:02.290
I have seen some shit over the years,
but I have never seen that before.

09:02.291 --> 09:05.753
Sorry, are we gonna play games
or are we gonna talk?

09:07.880 --> 09:11.175
The only person who was less forthcoming
in therapy than you...

09:12.385 --> 09:13.636
President Bradford.

09:15.429 --> 09:18.558
At least when we started.
But eventually, he opened up.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.477
I sat with him...

09:23.312 --> 09:26.690
the day before his death,
but you know that.

09:26.691 --> 09:28.025
How did he seem to you?

09:31.445 --> 09:33.322
Something happened that last week.

09:34.740 --> 09:37.994
He seemed... tired.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.662
- Burdened.
- He was the president.

09:40.663 --> 09:44.500
And he was in my office stumbling around
drunk in his bathrobe.

09:48.546 --> 09:50.589
I wanna know why
you stepped in the other day.

09:50.590 --> 09:52.008
I took another look at your file.

09:54.135 --> 09:57.679
Tell me about your relationship
with your father.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.981
Why did you two stop speaking?

10:08.858 --> 10:12.027
Sorry I'm late.
Traffic was awful.

10:12.028 --> 10:15.322
Oh, hey, I'm the one that asked you
to brave that rush hour traffic

10:15.323 --> 10:16.948
so we could spend
a few minutes catching up.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.784
- And here I am.
- And here you are.

10:19.785 --> 10:21.411
- Good son.
- I'm the best son.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.748
Don't push your luck.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.249
Solo chess.

10:26.250 --> 10:29.169
Mm-hmm. Helps focus the mind.

10:29.170 --> 10:30.837
So does a nap.

10:30.838 --> 10:33.633
- Relaxes me.
- You know, naps do that too.

10:35.468 --> 10:38.261
This should make things more interesting.

10:38.262 --> 10:40.222
- Uh-huh.
- Mm-hmm.

10:41.390 --> 10:43.975
All is well at the academy?

10:43.976 --> 10:45.436
All is well.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.483
You'd have made a hell of a pilot.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.985
What am I saying?
You can still fly with the best of 'em,

10:53.986 --> 10:56.613
even if they won't allow you
to do it for a living.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.744
I just wish that I could, you know,
I-- I could have done something.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.455
I am who I am because of what
you and Mom gave me.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.625
Poor eyesight is just part of the deal.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.671
- How's Teri?
- That's another reason I'm late.

11:12.672 --> 11:15.256
Uh, she's had better days.

11:15.257 --> 11:18.009
What do you mean, better days?
I don't understand.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.512
Something happened?

11:19.929 --> 11:23.223
Uh, she's been nauseous a lot
in the morning.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.183
- Mm.
- It's like a sickness.

11:25.184 --> 11:28.020
- Mm.
- Like a morning sickness.

11:28.479 --> 11:30.231
- Mm.
- Dad.

11:36.570 --> 11:40.407
I'm gonna be a grandfather.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.242
- Now, he's getting it.
- Aah!

11:44.328 --> 11:46.413
You know I'm too sexy to be a grandfather.

11:46.414 --> 11:49.417
There it is!

11:53.337 --> 11:55.714
- Thank you, sir.
- Mm-hmm.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.215
You pick a name yet?

11:57.216 --> 11:59.884
You know Teri's obsessed
with Elvis, right?

11:59.885 --> 12:04.431
- You sure she's one of us?
- Uh, she likes Presley.

12:04.432 --> 12:06.141
I like Fritos, but it doesn't mean

12:06.142 --> 12:08.268
I'm wanna name my granddaughter
after them.

12:10.980 --> 12:14.859
Guess I'm gonna be flying
through Dulles a lot more, huh?

12:16.193 --> 12:17.278
I guess so.

12:21.657 --> 12:23.826
There's nothing to tell, really.

12:25.035 --> 12:26.036
Look...

12:27.747 --> 12:29.706
I'll tell you what I know
about Cal Bradford,

12:29.707 --> 12:32.293
but you're asking me
to take a chance on you.

12:32.752 --> 12:36.088
And I need to know more about the man
I'm taking a chance on...

12:37.506 --> 12:39.008
than what's in his file.

12:40.426 --> 12:42.802
What do you say, do we have a deal?

12:56.192 --> 12:57.902
<i>You look good in my boxers.</i>

12:58.944 --> 13:00.361
- Do I?
- Mm.

13:00.362 --> 13:02.113
Mm.

13:04.200 --> 13:07.952
Would you like
a presidential debriefing this morning?

13:11.582 --> 13:15.335
- You're an idiot.
- I put on our song.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.487
Agent Robinson.

13:53.415 --> 13:56.209
I-- I didn't expect to see you here.
I just--

13:56.210 --> 13:58.295
A man I've known for 20 years
was murdered.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.339
Someone got access
to this house and killed him.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.758
We put him in the ground in two days.

14:03.759 --> 14:06.553
I'd like to find out
who did it before we do.

14:06.554 --> 14:09.557
Ma'am, I...

14:10.683 --> 14:12.142
I know that you're upset.

14:13.143 --> 14:14.811
I know that you cared about him very much.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.022
Cut the bullshit, Robinson.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.026
Someone stole the tablet,
and I want it back, do you understand?

14:23.571 --> 14:24.655
I'm on it.

14:25.739 --> 14:29.368
Are you sure?
Because here's what I can't have.

14:30.744 --> 14:32.620
I can't have some lovelorn mistress

14:32.621 --> 14:34.874
daydreaming about her secret
workplace affair.

14:35.916 --> 14:39.377
If it's all too close and too fresh,
I'll find someone else.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.337
I said I'm on it.

14:41.338 --> 14:43.048
Give me the space to do my job.

14:44.383 --> 14:46.467
Give me the confidence
to give you the space.

14:54.935 --> 14:57.353
They say we need more bunker babies.

14:57.354 --> 15:00.189
- Who does?
- You know, they.

15:01.483 --> 15:03.735
You actually think
everyone's past all the trauma?

15:03.736 --> 15:05.153
God, no. No.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.865
I mean, it's not like we're ever
all gonna be whole again.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.367
But by building this place,
we gave people the tools

15:11.368 --> 15:13.661
to begin to move on.

15:13.662 --> 15:16.581
Take a look around. What do you see?

15:18.667 --> 15:21.377
There's more socializing
than there is shopping.

15:21.378 --> 15:24.547
Ancient Greeks believed
that a healthy social life

15:24.548 --> 15:26.966
was the key to a flourishing life.

15:26.967 --> 15:30.553
And the <i>agora,
which is the Greek term for market,</i>

15:30.554 --> 15:32.263
was an important component.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.182
It's why the population
down here was so limited.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.934
It's...
just small enough

15:35.935 --> 15:38.186
to retain that sense of community.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.647
I mean, it's also the ideal
population size

15:40.648 --> 15:42.440
for our oxygen filtration system.

15:42.441 --> 15:44.860
But you know,
there's no fancy Greek word for that.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.987
Okay, you want me to bite? I'll bite.

15:47.988 --> 15:51.157
Why do you know so much about this place?

15:51.158 --> 15:52.660
Because I helped design it.

15:53.744 --> 15:55.621
The psychological aspects of it, that is.

15:56.664 --> 16:02.627
I was hired to help make a community
of grieving, dislocated people

16:02.628 --> 16:04.254
live a flourishing life.

16:05.756 --> 16:08.424
One with grocery stores, and parks,

16:08.425 --> 16:12.720
and a diner with the world's
all-time greatest cheese fries.

16:12.721 --> 16:17.350
I like to think of myself as, um,
an architect of social well-being.

16:17.351 --> 16:18.935
Because you brought in cheese fries?

16:18.936 --> 16:21.729
Uh, the world's all-time greatest
cheese fries.

16:21.730 --> 16:22.815
Hmm.

16:28.779 --> 16:30.280
Do you think they have anything?

16:34.326 --> 16:37.912
-  God save the queen.
- Knock it off, Pace.

16:37.913 --> 16:40.082
Okay, here's where we are.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.419
Forensics didn't find
any prints or fiber evidence.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.587
Anybody close to him
seems to have an alibi.

16:46.588 --> 16:50.049
We have no motive, no murder weapon.

16:50.050 --> 16:51.300
What about DNA?

16:51.301 --> 16:53.261
Samples were taken
from the president's body.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.762
It's gonna take a few days.

16:54.763 --> 16:57.306
The M.E. says that the time of death

16:57.307 --> 17:00.643
lines up with the window
in which our cameras were down.

17:00.644 --> 17:02.937
And the preliminary autopsy report

17:02.938 --> 17:07.942
shows that the cause of death
was blunt force trauma

17:07.943 --> 17:10.946
from a heavy irregularly shaped object.

17:12.781 --> 17:15.366
Any other questions?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.326
Not me.

17:17.327 --> 17:19.579
Oh, you know what? Wait, I do have one.

17:19.580 --> 17:22.583
Why in the holy fuck isn't Xavier here?

17:23.917 --> 17:26.002
Agent Collins ignored protocol.

17:26.003 --> 17:28.087
His actions that morning
were antithetical to--

17:28.088 --> 17:30.631
Don't use big words
to try to confuse me, Robinson.

17:30.632 --> 17:32.926
He's our best agent, he should be here.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.157
Oh, don't mind me.

18:00.204 --> 18:01.996
Our cameras were down
the night of the murder,

18:01.997 --> 18:03.790
so that's what we're focusing on.

18:03.791 --> 18:07.502
What are the chances of getting something
off the surveillance system?

18:07.503 --> 18:10.630
It's a long shot, but, uh,
maybe I could pull the equivalent

18:10.631 --> 18:12.381
of a digital fingerprint off the network.

18:12.382 --> 18:14.133
It's about a 10% chance
I can get us the identity

18:14.134 --> 18:15.761
of the person who turned them off.

18:16.845 --> 18:17.929
How long?

18:17.930 --> 18:20.307
I'm not a magician.
Uh, end of day, maybe.

18:21.892 --> 18:24.143
Okay, that'll be all.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.229
Thank you.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.237
I'm confident that--

18:37.699 --> 18:40.409
I'm off to calm down
the most neurotic president

18:40.410 --> 18:41.995
in the history of the world.

18:43.288 --> 18:44.915
When I come back, I want some answers.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.587
<i>You were hired by Sinatra?</i>

18:51.588 --> 18:55.133
Ah. Samantha. Sinatra to you.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.636
We met, um, when she was utterly broken.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.513
I was an expert in grief.

19:00.514 --> 19:03.808
She thought I could help her,
and she gave me an opportunity.

19:03.809 --> 19:06.979
- And now, you're here.
- And now, we're here.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.273
Can she be trusted?

19:11.400 --> 19:14.653
I'm done talking for a minute.
Tell me about your father.

19:16.196 --> 19:17.738
What happened?

19:17.739 --> 19:19.783
<i>Attention, passengers...</i>

19:20.868 --> 19:24.203
Mm, getting nervous about that move?

19:28.709 --> 19:30.627
They put me on the VP's detail.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.172
Oh, wow.

19:34.590 --> 19:37.175
- Congratulations, son.
- Thank you very much.

19:37.176 --> 19:38.676
Oh, wow.

19:38.677 --> 19:42.430
And tell me, whose job is it
to choose the code names?

19:42.431 --> 19:44.182
No, seriously.

19:44.183 --> 19:45.975
- Ok--
- Is that the, the Secret Service?

19:45.976 --> 19:48.394
'Cause I've got some ideas
for that imbecile.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.938
Well, I'm sorry to inform you,
but the White House

19:50.939 --> 19:54.400
gives out code names
in consultation with the protectees.

19:54.401 --> 19:56.360
I read somewhere

19:56.361 --> 20:02.366
that, um, JFK and Jackie
were "Lancer" and "Lace."

20:02.367 --> 20:03.993
- Huh.
- Yeah.

20:03.994 --> 20:05.411
Quite apropos, don't you think?

20:05.412 --> 20:06.872
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- People forgot that.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.297
Hey, Dad, what's going on there?

20:16.298 --> 20:17.882
Hm?

20:17.883 --> 20:20.259
- You got a tremor, I just saw it.
- No, it's nothing.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.720
- Talk to me.
- It's nothing, it's nothing.

20:22.721 --> 20:25.265
It's nothing at all. Forget about it.

20:27.476 --> 20:29.186
What aren't you telling me?

20:32.689 --> 20:34.191
I have Parkinson's.

20:38.195 --> 20:39.779
Oh, don't. Come on now, don't--

20:39.780 --> 20:43.324
If you start crying,
I-I, I'm gonna call in a bomb threat.

20:43.325 --> 20:45.619
Dad, I'm just--

20:46.995 --> 20:48.455
When did you-- right.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.085
I'm so sorry.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.295
Oh, well...

20:56.296 --> 20:57.755
I'm dealing with it.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.758
You know, I'm managing
all the symptoms with meds.

21:00.759 --> 21:03.094
I'm eating healthy, exercising.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.805
Your mother's up my ass about it.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.223
Did you-- did you tell the company?

21:07.224 --> 21:09.142
No, of course not.

21:10.143 --> 21:12.853
What? You're hiding it?

21:12.854 --> 21:14.981
- Ah...
- What about the other flight crew?

21:14.982 --> 21:16.148
Well, some of the guys know.

21:16.149 --> 21:18.526
They know that they're just gonna
have to be a bit more vigilant

21:18.527 --> 21:20.278
when we're working together.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.822
I'm on top of it.

21:23.657 --> 21:25.367
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

21:26.410 --> 21:29.161
You're violating
your union's code of ethics.

21:29.162 --> 21:31.998
Hey, you could go to jail, Dad.

21:31.999 --> 21:34.293
Oh, come on. Come on.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.880
- Alright, what would you have me do?
- Retire.

21:39.881 --> 21:43.718
And then, I don't know, take up golf.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.636
Take Mom to Italy, like she wants.

21:45.637 --> 21:49.266
But you gotta stop flying, right now.

21:51.852 --> 21:54.937
Well, I appreciate your concern,
but this is my decision to make.

21:54.938 --> 21:57.190
- Dad, this is--
- Xa...

21:59.026 --> 22:00.360
I'm a pilot, son.

22:01.695 --> 22:03.613
That's what I am.

22:06.116 --> 22:09.577
And, uh, I just need a little more time.

22:09.578 --> 22:10.662
That's all.

22:11.955 --> 22:14.165
I've got a flight to make.

22:26.803 --> 22:30.264
My father and I had
a falling out, it happens.

22:30.265 --> 22:33.726
He wanted me to be a pilot,
follow in his footsteps.

22:33.727 --> 22:36.020
It turned out I couldn't do that,
so I joined the Secret Service.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.064
I know the order of events, okay?
I read it in the profile.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.648
- There's nothing else.
- Well, I think there is.

22:39.649 --> 22:41.817
- I'm telling you, there isn't.
- Tell me about his last flight.

22:41.818 --> 22:43.028
No.

22:46.615 --> 22:47.865
- You're frustrated.
- Yes.

22:47.866 --> 22:51.202
- Okay, with me asking questions and--
- With all of it, okay?!

22:51.203 --> 22:54.580
But clearly, you're a very smart person,
and clearly, you've worked very hard

22:54.581 --> 22:57.333
- at becoming, uh, an architect of--
- Social well-being.

22:57.334 --> 23:00.378
But there's nothing normal
about any of this.

23:00.379 --> 23:02.421
I wanna know what you know about Cal,

23:02.422 --> 23:05.800
and I don't wanna talk about my old life,
because my old life ended.

23:05.801 --> 23:07.426
The world ended,

23:07.427 --> 23:10.222
and everyone and everything in it is gone.

23:11.431 --> 23:14.975
And no amount of groceries,
or pre-recorded insect noises,

23:14.976 --> 23:17.645
or most especially,
goddamn fuckin' cheese fries

23:17.646 --> 23:19.398
is gonna change a thing about it.

23:25.278 --> 23:26.655
Wow.

23:28.907 --> 23:30.242
Yeah, that was a lot.

23:35.330 --> 23:36.415
So, what now?

23:38.542 --> 23:43.213
Well, I mean, I have an idea,
but I don't think you're gonna like it.

23:43.713 --> 23:44.714
Try me.

23:47.676 --> 23:49.678
I was thinking
we go get some cheese fries.

24:07.154 --> 24:08.238
This is bad.

24:09.364 --> 24:11.157
What are we gonna do if Garcia finds out?

24:11.158 --> 24:13.826
Take it easy.
He just said there's a 90% chance

24:13.827 --> 24:15.411
he can't figure out who messed
with the system.

24:15.412 --> 24:16.829
Yeah, and there's a 10% chance he can.

24:21.209 --> 24:23.586
What the fuck, Brooks?

24:23.587 --> 24:25.588
This part of the house is off limits.

24:25.589 --> 24:28.300
- On whose orders?
- Robinson's.

24:31.678 --> 24:32.679
Thanks.

24:37.100 --> 24:38.476
- You think he heard us?
- No.

24:38.477 --> 24:40.187
- He could tell Robinson.
- Come here.

24:41.354 --> 24:42.772
Don't worry so much.

24:43.482 --> 24:47.194
If it comes down to it,
I'll deal with Robinson, alright?

24:50.197 --> 24:51.865
Go. You go.

25:05.253 --> 25:07.338
Henry, you need to calm down.

25:07.339 --> 25:09.591
Remember what the doctors told you?

25:12.260 --> 25:16.138
Mr. President, I can protect you
in your home and in public.

25:16.139 --> 25:18.682
But if a blood vessel bursts in your brain

25:18.683 --> 25:22.187
or you stroke out,
well, sir, I'm not that good.

25:23.355 --> 25:26.065
Cal had state-of-the-art security,
look what happened to him.

25:26.066 --> 25:27.317
Cal is dead.

25:28.401 --> 25:31.154
He was my friend,
and we're just moving on.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.783
Going about our lives
as if nothing happened.

25:36.368 --> 25:38.370
They're still doing
a goddamn carnival tomorrow!

25:43.750 --> 25:46.169
Cal was a decent and honorable man.

25:52.092 --> 25:53.426
He was my friend, too.

25:56.972 --> 26:00.892
And we honor him by being clear-eyed
in our pursuit of justice.

26:02.060 --> 26:06.188
And do we know
where this pursuit is taking us?

26:06.189 --> 26:07.566
You have no leads.

26:08.942 --> 26:11.235
I thought you had surveillance cameras
all over the place.

26:11.236 --> 26:13.070
Well, despite what you might have heard,

26:13.071 --> 26:15.657
I don't record everything
that happens in this city.

26:26.334 --> 26:28.753
Henry, you've walked
into a lot here, I get it.

26:30.005 --> 26:32.132
It's unfair what's being asked of you.

26:32.882 --> 26:35.385
President. I mean...

26:36.469 --> 26:37.511
It's a lot.

26:40.599 --> 26:41.683
It's a lot.

26:43.143 --> 26:45.394
But you're doing a fantastic job.

26:45.395 --> 26:48.607
Really, I mean,
I just couldn't be more pleased.

26:50.066 --> 26:52.109
You're a quiet man, but you're steady one,

26:52.110 --> 26:53.570
and you've stepped up to the plate.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.822
The only person doing better than you
is your lovely wife here.

26:56.823 --> 26:58.949
-  Oh, please. Stop.
-  It's true.

26:58.950 --> 27:00.993
You are crushing it, Nance!

27:00.994 --> 27:04.413
Your outfit at the swearing-in?
Get the fuck outta here.

27:04.414 --> 27:07.291
I mean, women were going crazy.

27:07.292 --> 27:09.377
We're gonna have to open a store.

27:11.212 --> 27:15.425
Samantha, promise me
you'll catch whoever did this.

27:16.426 --> 27:17.552
I will, sir.

27:19.929 --> 27:21.431
Then, that will be all.

27:25.810 --> 27:27.312
It's my office, sir.

27:28.980 --> 27:31.191
Yes. Of course.

27:40.867 --> 27:43.327
I can't believe
you're cheating on me with him.

27:43.328 --> 27:45.537
I know, I'm sorry. I usually come here

27:45.538 --> 27:47.539
and share a plate of cheese fries
with Maggie.

27:47.540 --> 27:50.751
Now, obviously, down here,
um, we use nut cheese.

27:50.752 --> 27:52.961
-  Mm.
- Which I know sounds disgusting

27:52.962 --> 27:55.172
and weird in such a larger prominent dose.

27:55.173 --> 27:56.924
But I swear, you won't notice.

27:56.925 --> 27:59.718
- I hate that cashew cheese crap.
- Oh no, this place does it different.

27:59.719 --> 28:01.887
It's not the cashews,
it's the chemicals.

28:01.888 --> 28:03.097
Here we are.

28:03.098 --> 28:04.890
Thank you.

28:04.891 --> 28:06.809
One order, extra cheese, coming up.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.018
Mm-hmm.

28:13.149 --> 28:14.650
Wow.

28:14.651 --> 28:17.361
I thought I knew what vigilance
looked like, but holy shit.

28:17.362 --> 28:19.406
You've been scanning this room
from the moment we walked in.

28:20.990 --> 28:22.449
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

28:22.450 --> 28:25.661
Do you always choose the seat
facing the door?

28:25.662 --> 28:27.831
- Old habits die hard.
- Mm.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.669
And what are you staring at now?

28:33.670 --> 28:35.713
You're identifying all the exits
in the room, aren't you?

28:35.714 --> 28:38.424
No, I did that the minute
we walked in here.

28:38.425 --> 28:41.511
What I'm staring at
is the woman seated in that booth.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.891
Different time and place, I would have
considered her a potential threat.

28:49.436 --> 28:50.770
Why? Because she's hungry?

28:52.647 --> 28:55.859
The knife. She can use either hand.

28:56.860 --> 28:57.861
Hm.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.530
That must be difficult.

29:01.531 --> 29:03.283
How do you mean?

29:04.117 --> 29:06.786
Just seeing the world as nothing
but a series of threats.

29:07.829 --> 29:09.456
You see something different?

29:11.249 --> 29:13.208
Well, where you see a threat, Xavier,

29:13.209 --> 29:16.838
I see a mother who's learned
to feed her child on either side of her.

29:18.381 --> 29:19.466
Okay.

29:20.592 --> 29:22.177
So, where are the kids?

29:25.722 --> 29:28.015
We all lost something on our way here.

29:28.016 --> 29:30.351
You know that as well as anyone.

29:31.394 --> 29:33.980
I didn't lose my wife,
I know exactly where she was.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.982
She was in a different city
when it happened,

29:36.983 --> 29:40.236
and she died because he didn't get her
to a goddamn plane.

29:48.703 --> 29:51.538
- Please remember to chew, Gabriela.
- Move your hand or I'll eat it.

29:51.539 --> 29:53.373
Just let...

29:53.374 --> 29:54.750
Mm!

29:54.751 --> 29:56.418
So good.

29:56.419 --> 30:00.255
-  After you.
- No, no, no, please. You first.

30:01.591 --> 30:03.009
Pick a good one.

30:07.180 --> 30:11.935
<i>♪ I'll take the long road ♪</i>

30:13.019 --> 30:14.646
- Damn, that's good.
- Mm-hmm.

30:17.148 --> 30:18.233
Mm.

30:19.984 --> 30:22.361
God. You know what I really miss?

30:22.362 --> 30:23.446
Hm?

30:25.740 --> 30:28.242
- You know, it's stupid, forget it.
- Mm. Oh, no, no, no, it's good.

30:28.243 --> 30:31.871
It's good to remember the things
that brought you joy.

30:34.457 --> 30:35.750
Soft shell crab.

30:38.962 --> 30:40.171
Summer peaches.

30:43.716 --> 30:45.175
Smell of a campfire.

30:45.176 --> 30:47.846
Mm. Peaceful snowfall.

30:48.513 --> 30:51.558
The warmth of the sun. The real sun.

30:53.560 --> 30:58.481
<i>♪ I'll take the long road ♪</i>

30:58.773 --> 31:00.400
Sand between my toes.

31:11.077 --> 31:14.998
On our second date, Teri and I drove out
to the beach at Sandy Point.

31:16.541 --> 31:20.627
Teri loved the ocean.
And I do too, really.

31:20.628 --> 31:23.298
But, um, the sand?

31:24.340 --> 31:26.633
Not so much.

31:26.634 --> 31:29.094
So, a trip to the beach
is a bit like a combat mission.

31:29.095 --> 31:31.222
It's me against this damn sand.

31:32.473 --> 31:35.267
I gotta find just the right spot.

31:35.268 --> 31:37.311
Fold open the chairs, set up the umbrella,

31:37.312 --> 31:39.355
lay out the towels just so.

31:41.232 --> 31:44.485
I didn't realize Teri was watching me
the entire time.

31:45.653 --> 31:50.033
So, there I am, all set up, finally.

31:51.075 --> 31:53.577
And she just walks over
and messes all my shit up.

31:53.578 --> 31:55.079
Oh.

31:56.414 --> 31:59.042
She was the person
who could get a little sand on me.

32:02.086 --> 32:04.130
She was the only person who could do that.

32:06.674 --> 32:08.508
She sounds lovely.

32:08.509 --> 32:13.056
<i>♪ I'll take the long road ♪</i>

32:14.474 --> 32:18.018
<i>♪ I'll take the long road, yeah, yeah ♪</i>

32:18.019 --> 32:19.729
<i>♪ I'll... ♪</i>

32:21.606 --> 32:24.484
You said you wanted to know
about my dad's last flight.

32:33.618 --> 32:35.369
- There you go.
- Thank you.

32:35.370 --> 32:38.205
- Mm-hmm.
- Whose start is it?

32:38.206 --> 32:39.374
It's mine.

32:41.125 --> 32:45.337
Ooh, looks like the beginning
of the Scotch game.

32:45.338 --> 32:48.048
Aha, that's aggressive for you, son.

32:48.049 --> 32:50.635
- Something different for a change.
- Mm-hmm.

32:53.429 --> 32:56.766
Oh, the meds are taking care
of the tremors, I'm fine.

32:58.393 --> 33:03.231
Mm-hmm. Notice you're wearing
a different lapel pin.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.652
I was named to the president's detail.

33:10.655 --> 33:13.241
I mean, I'm one of like 50 agents,
but still.

33:14.242 --> 33:15.660
I wanted to tell you in person.

33:21.499 --> 33:23.710
You get to go aboard Air Force One?

33:24.711 --> 33:25.920
Yes, sir.

33:28.673 --> 33:29.966
My God.

33:32.468 --> 33:33.761
Would you like to see her?

33:37.640 --> 33:38.932
<i>Hell yeah.</i>

33:45.606 --> 33:48.525
She can fly at over 600 miles per hour,

33:48.526 --> 33:51.862
is equipped with 85 phone lines,

33:51.863 --> 33:56.533
and get this, has flares for defense
against missile attacks

33:56.534 --> 33:59.495
and can withstand
a nuclear blast on the ground.

34:07.920 --> 34:09.047
You good?

34:10.381 --> 34:11.924
You won't understand, son.

34:14.135 --> 34:19.974
You won't understand
till your kids get older.

34:21.184 --> 34:23.061
Look at where you are.

34:27.106 --> 34:28.982
Look at what you've done, son.

34:28.983 --> 34:31.778
Look at what you've done, Dad.

34:32.987 --> 34:34.988
The son of a Tuskegee Airman

34:34.989 --> 34:38.200
who became one of a handful
of Black captains

34:38.201 --> 34:39.785
of a commercial airline,

34:39.786 --> 34:44.414
and his son now protects
the President of the United States.

34:44.415 --> 34:46.417
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

34:47.877 --> 34:49.128
Look at where we are.

34:52.048 --> 34:56.594
And Dad, we got here
by doing things the right way.

34:57.386 --> 34:58.387
Yeah.

34:59.180 --> 35:00.431
Yeah.

35:02.141 --> 35:03.351
It's time, Pop.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.105
You can't fly anymore.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.441
You gotta retire.

35:12.819 --> 35:15.237
That's not your decision to make.

35:15.238 --> 35:18.658
It shouldn't be,
but you made it my decision.

35:20.993 --> 35:22.829
What have you done?

35:29.919 --> 35:32.630
These papers don't take away
years of service.

35:33.923 --> 35:36.592
They say, "Well done, Dad."

35:37.718 --> 35:39.595
That's what these papers say,
that's all they say.

35:41.681 --> 35:43.099
I filed them for you, Dad.

35:44.725 --> 35:47.687
I filed them because I knew you wouldn't.

35:57.947 --> 36:03.077
I'd see him on holidays, but without
the airport meetings, things shifted.

36:05.204 --> 36:07.165
Our relationship was never the same.

36:09.208 --> 36:12.712
The disease progressed quickly,
and we lost him soon after that.

36:15.339 --> 36:18.009
It must have been very difficult
to do what you did.

36:21.387 --> 36:22.847
That's the thing, it wasn't.

36:24.432 --> 36:26.142
It's the way he wired me, uh...

36:28.144 --> 36:29.312
it just wasn't.

36:32.773 --> 36:34.358
You have a strong moral compass.

36:34.901 --> 36:36.694
And it served me real well.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.616
Well, I think it may now.

36:44.327 --> 36:46.621
It's time to show you my cards.

37:02.803 --> 37:04.180
What do you have for me?

37:05.264 --> 37:06.432
Something good.

37:08.935 --> 37:12.271
You strike me as the kind of person
who likes a show.

37:13.481 --> 37:16.192
Sit down. I'm gonna give you a show.

37:16.943 --> 37:18.027
Bring 'em in.

37:30.164 --> 37:32.208
Why did they do it?

37:33.876 --> 37:35.544
That's the question I keep asking myself.

37:40.758 --> 37:43.677
Are you talking to me? I... don't follow.

37:43.678 --> 37:45.846
Are we talking about the investigation?

37:46.889 --> 37:48.390
The fireplace.

37:48.391 --> 37:51.185
Now, why would they build
a fireplace down here?

37:53.062 --> 37:54.313
I-- I don't know, ma'am.

37:55.606 --> 37:57.899
We're-- we're in a cave,

37:57.900 --> 38:02.947
and fire is elemental to who we are?

38:04.407 --> 38:06.367
Storytellers or some bullshit?

38:08.202 --> 38:09.869
Why did you two shut down the cameras

38:09.870 --> 38:11.080
the night of the murder?

38:13.874 --> 38:14.917
Tell her.

38:18.838 --> 38:20.464
She doesn't have the footage.

38:21.757 --> 38:23.049
That's true, Billy.

38:23.050 --> 38:25.594
That is very true.

38:26.929 --> 38:29.015
But we have your digital footprint.

38:29.598 --> 38:33.269
We know you accessed the system
to shut down the cameras.

38:34.103 --> 38:35.645
And it wasn't just
the night of the murder.

38:35.646 --> 38:37.188
You've done it other nights too.

38:37.189 --> 38:40.442
- In fact, you've been doing it for months.
-  Please.

38:40.443 --> 38:44.112
That all adds up to means and opportunity.

38:44.113 --> 38:47.158
- Now, we just need a motive.
- We were playing Wii.

38:51.120 --> 38:52.121
What?

38:53.956 --> 38:55.541
<i>Wii Tennis, actually.</i>

38:57.335 --> 38:59.169
- What the fuck is <i>Wii Tennis?
-  A game.</i>

38:59.170 --> 39:01.213
A video game.

39:02.423 --> 39:04.842
Also, sometimes we eat
his candy from his junk drawer.

39:05.384 --> 39:07.345
Also, I once took a nap in his bed.

39:09.305 --> 39:10.639
Billy tried on his socks.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.435
It's the truth.

39:15.478 --> 39:17.480
Stupid and unprofessional as it sounds.

39:18.105 --> 39:19.564
We've been protecting a president

39:19.565 --> 39:21.858
inside of a secure bunker
where nothing ever happens.

39:21.859 --> 39:23.569
Until something did happen.

39:24.070 --> 39:26.821
We realized if we shut down
the security system,

39:26.822 --> 39:30.658
we could-- we could play his video games
and use his cool shit,

39:30.659 --> 39:32.327
and no one would really
be the worst off for it.

39:32.328 --> 39:35.122
My God, you absolute idiots.

39:38.626 --> 39:40.293
Everybody get the fuck outta here.

39:44.715 --> 39:45.716
Okay.

39:52.973 --> 39:55.518
Start finding me some answers,
or I'll find someone who will.

39:59.563 --> 40:02.399
Today was, uh, interesting.

40:02.400 --> 40:05.944
Mm, I thought you were about
to admit that you had fun.

40:05.945 --> 40:07.278
- Never, no.
- Well...

40:07.279 --> 40:09.782
I'm... I'm tired.

40:13.160 --> 40:17.748
Hey, do the numbers 8-1-2-0-9-2
mean anything to you?

40:20.000 --> 40:22.878
No. No, why?

40:23.963 --> 40:25.297
Just something I'm looking into.

40:29.718 --> 40:31.762
There's so few people in the world.

40:33.848 --> 40:35.975
I guess I'm one of the lucky ones.

40:37.643 --> 40:39.270
But it doesn't feel like that.

40:41.647 --> 40:43.232
I don't appreciate it.

40:47.486 --> 40:50.281
I'm not sure I should have been
chosen to be here.

40:52.867 --> 40:54.660
Honestly, I don't know why I was.

40:59.874 --> 41:01.500
Do you play poker?

41:02.877 --> 41:04.295
It's not my thing.

41:06.881 --> 41:09.507
I lost my parents
when I was relatively young.

41:09.508 --> 41:13.178
Uh, my mom as a kid,
and my dad as a teenager.

41:13.179 --> 41:15.598
It's why I went into palliative care.

41:18.100 --> 41:22.188
My dad taught me to play
when I was in middle school.

41:24.315 --> 41:26.525
It was our time together, I loved it.

41:27.818 --> 41:31.070
We'd play with tons of wild cards,

41:31.071 --> 41:33.865
and these wild cards could be anything,

41:33.866 --> 41:35.408
which made it even more fun
because it meant

41:35.409 --> 41:38.245
that you always had a chance.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.335
Xavier, you are here...

41:45.711 --> 41:47.338
because I chose you.

41:50.841 --> 41:53.302
Everyone's here because I chose them.

41:54.386 --> 41:56.179
<i>We need you
to choose your new lead agent.</i>

41:56.180 --> 41:59.057
Oh, I told you I trusted you
to make the selections.

41:59.058 --> 42:01.226
And we have.

42:01.227 --> 42:03.269
Cal, the world is going to shit.

42:03.270 --> 42:05.730
You're gonna be the one in charge
when it ends, and it's gonna be awful.

42:05.731 --> 42:08.274
This person will be by your side
the entire time.

42:08.275 --> 42:10.985
I want it to be someone
you're comfortable with.

42:10.986 --> 42:13.488
- Who's she?
-  She's on the team.

42:13.489 --> 42:16.241
She's evaluating
and recommending candidates.

42:16.242 --> 42:17.867
-  The gatekeeper.
- I'm Gabriela.

42:17.868 --> 42:21.037
- Eh, both start with a G.
- This is true.

42:21.038 --> 42:23.541
- I'm great at spelling.
- It's why I voted for you, sir.

42:25.501 --> 42:27.419
- I like her.
-  Mr. President...

42:28.546 --> 42:31.464
these are all vetted and approved
candidates for your new lead agent.

42:31.465 --> 42:33.634
There's a shit ton of 'em.

42:38.722 --> 42:40.390
You keeping that one for yourself?

42:40.391 --> 42:43.393
Uh, no, sir. I was actually hoping
that you would read this one first.

42:43.394 --> 42:44.811
He's already on your detail,

42:44.812 --> 42:47.273
but I have a pretty good feeling
about him, sir.

42:52.945 --> 42:54.697
Let's go with your gut then.

42:57.241 --> 42:59.033
When do I meet him?

42:59.034 --> 43:00.827
He's waiting in the hallway,
Mr. President.

43:00.828 --> 43:02.204
Okie-dokie.

43:04.039 --> 43:05.291
We'll give you the room.

43:09.128 --> 43:10.879
Agent Collins, come on in.

43:15.509 --> 43:16.760
Oh, shoes off, please.

43:18.387 --> 43:19.930
<i>That was my main job.</i>

43:20.931 --> 43:23.976
Not grocery stores or cheese fries.

43:25.811 --> 43:28.439
It was choosing the thousands of people

43:30.024 --> 43:31.191
who would live

43:32.651 --> 43:34.111
when everyone else would die.

43:37.573 --> 43:41.075
And every day,
I see the faces of the thousands

43:41.076 --> 43:42.911
that I didn't pick to be saved.

43:45.998 --> 43:47.583
But you...

43:49.376 --> 43:50.919
You were my wild card.

43:52.671 --> 43:54.714
If something went wrong,
I needed the person

43:54.715 --> 43:57.760
who would do the right thing,
no matter what.

44:02.514 --> 44:05.100
So, this was all some kind of test?

44:06.810 --> 44:11.523
I needed to know the man behind the file.

44:15.944 --> 44:18.572
Tell me why you wrote
that message on your hand.

44:19.698 --> 44:20.866
What was that all about?

44:33.337 --> 44:34.588
I'm married.

44:41.220 --> 44:42.304
I know.
