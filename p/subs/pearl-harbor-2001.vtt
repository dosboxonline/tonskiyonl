00:59.684 --> 01:03.480
- German bandits at two o'clock.
- Increase throttle. Power dive.

01:07.817 --> 01:10.028
Spell it right, Rafe.

01:10.111 --> 01:13.573
"Rudder" is spelled with 2 "d"s.

01:13.656 --> 01:16.659
- Thanks, wingman.
- Yeah, sure.

01:17.202 --> 01:19.204
Whoa, bandits.

01:20.663 --> 01:22.957
- Crack shootin', Danny.
- Crack shootin', Rafe.

01:23.041 --> 01:26.044
- Land of the free.
- Home of the brave.

01:44.604 --> 01:46.898
Great flyin', Dad.

01:48.691 --> 01:51.069
Come on.
I'm gonna teach you how to fly.

01:58.743 --> 02:00.912
- I get the front.
- No, you take the back.

02:00.995 --> 02:03.164
I'm bigger, and I 
should be in front.

02:03.248 --> 02:05.458
I'm older, and I'm teachin', so no.

02:05.542 --> 02:08.836
- Wow. It's like we're really flying.
- Yeah, I did it lots of times.

02:08.919 --> 02:11.798
Come on, you man the guns.
I'll give her some throttle.

02:11.881 --> 02:14.843
We gotta get those
dirty German bandits.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.850
Gosh!

02:26.771 --> 02:29.440
- Hang on.
- Make it stop, Rafe.

02:31.442 --> 02:34.821
I've seen my dad do this 
lots of times. Don't worry.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.783
Rafe.

02:39.784 --> 02:42.495
My gosh. We're flying.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.455
We're flying.

03:00.763 --> 03:03.850
My dad's gonna kill me.
Come on.

03:05.602 --> 03:07.103
Yes!

03:08.271 --> 03:11.065
- We flew.
- We flew. Yes. I'm a pilot.

03:11.149 --> 03:12.775
- I know.
- Yeah!

03:12.859 --> 03:14.819
We flew.

03:14.903 --> 03:16.112
We flew.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.906
- You no-account boy.
- Daddy.

03:17.989 --> 03:21.910
I done told you, you spend time playing
with this stupid boy can't read,

03:21.993 --> 03:23.578
you ain't never goin'
to amount to nothin'.

03:23.661 --> 03:26.331
He ain't stupid, Daddy.

03:26.414 --> 03:27.624
Daddy.

03:29.667 --> 03:31.002
Come on.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.757
Get on back home. Now.

03:38.343 --> 03:41.429
Get on up. You got work to do.

03:41.512 --> 03:44.098
Come on. Come on, get on home.

03:46.476 --> 03:48.478
You let him alone.

03:50.355 --> 03:51.606
Daddy, no.

03:51.689 --> 03:55.610
I will bust you open, 
you dirty German.

03:55.693 --> 03:58.279
What'd you call me?

03:58.363 --> 04:01.199
I fought the Germans in France.

04:02.200 --> 04:05.036
And I fought 'em in the trenches.

04:06.037 --> 04:10.166
And I pray to God no one ever 
has to see the things that I saw.

04:25.848 --> 04:28.101
You're my best friend.

04:29.852 --> 04:32.021
Daddy, wait.

04:33.898 --> 04:35.900
Daddy, wait.

04:42.448 --> 04:45.660
Adolf Hitler builds the 
German military machine ...

04:45.743 --> 04:47.787
and drags all of Europe into war.

04:47.870 --> 04:53.042
But even while France falls to Hitler,
America still refuses to join the fighting.

05:10.768 --> 05:13.396
- Where's McCawley and Walker?
- Still training, sir.

05:15.064 --> 05:18.651
All right, Danny. Let's show 'em how to fly.
We're gonna play chicken. You ready?

05:18.735 --> 05:20.945
This ain't the farm,
these ain't crop dusters.

05:21.029 --> 05:23.698
- I'm not playing chicken with you.
- Don't be a baby.

05:23.781 --> 05:26.117
- I'm not doing it, Rafe.
- I'm coming right at you.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.910
You can turn, or you can hit me.

05:30.872 --> 05:33.291
- What the ...?
- Oh, boy.

05:36.544 --> 05:40.256
Why you always bustin' my ass, 
Rafe? Which way you goin'?

05:42.133 --> 05:44.927
I guess I'll go right.
No, uh, left. I'll go left.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.849
- OK, we're goin' left, right?
- Right. Right?

05:49.932 --> 05:51.976
Right we're goin' right,
or right we're goin' left?

05:52.060 --> 05:55.688
Well, now you got me all mixed up.
I don't know. Make up your mind.

05:57.982 --> 06:00.943
God, Rafe, we're going right.
Righty-tighty!

06:10.661 --> 06:12.663
Those are some smooth aces.

06:12.747 --> 06:17.085
Did you say something? Cos let me 
tell ya, those farm boys are grounded.

06:17.168 --> 06:22.215
Yes, sir, an entirely unacceptable 
use of military aircraft, sir.

06:23.633 --> 06:25.093
- Get my hat.
- Yes, sir.

06:25.176 --> 06:28.221
Get those hedge-hoppers
in Doolittle's office.

06:28.304 --> 06:30.598
After two years of training,

06:30.681 --> 06:34.560
you believe that a $45,000 airplane
is there for your amusement?

06:34.644 --> 06:37.188
No, sir. I was just trying
to keep my edge, Major.

06:37.271 --> 06:41.567
When you did the outside loop last week,
what was that? Honing your skills?

06:41.651 --> 06:44.153
That's not training, McCawley.
That's a stunt.

06:44.237 --> 06:48.950
And I personally consider it
to be reckless and irresponsible.

06:49.951 --> 06:51.285
Major.

06:53.955 --> 06:56.958
You're famous for being the first 
man in the world to do it.

06:57.041 --> 07:00.670
- Don't get cute with me, son.
- No, sir, I don't mean to be disrespectful.

07:00.753 --> 07:02.463
I just think that ...

07:02.547 --> 07:07.051
Well, I ... It is reckless and irresponsible
if you're just doing it to be a show-off.

07:07.135 --> 07:11.139
But I was doing it to try to inspire the men,
sir, in the way that you've inspired me.

07:11.222 --> 07:13.307
I believe the French
even have a word for that,

07:13.391 --> 07:16.561
when the men get together to honour
their leaders. They call it an homage, sir.

07:16.644 --> 07:18.479
- A what?
- An homage, sir.

07:18.563 --> 07:20.231
That's bullshit, McCawley.

07:23.484 --> 07:26.612
But it's very, very good bullshit.

07:26.696 --> 07:28.865
Thank you, sir.

07:30.658 --> 07:34.287
McCawley, you remind me
of myself 15 years ago.

07:34.370 --> 07:37.039
Which is why we need
to discuss this.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.125
Have a seat, son.

07:45.882 --> 07:48.885
The British have accepted you
into the Eagle Squadron.

07:48.968 --> 07:53.514
You're on your way to England tomorrow,
if you still want to go.

07:56.100 --> 08:00.980
Just a few British pilots are all that stand
between Hitler and total victory in Europe.

08:01.063 --> 08:05.485
- They'll need all the help they can get.
- Yes, sir. Well, I'm on my way.

08:05.568 --> 08:08.362
Just for the record, I'm supposed 
to ask you to reconsider.

08:08.446 --> 08:09.906
Sir?

08:09.989 --> 08:13.951
Sooner or later we're gonna be in 
this war whether we like it or not.

08:14.035 --> 08:19.207
And I'm gonna need all of my best pilots.
So it's my duty to ask you to stay.

08:19.290 --> 08:22.460
Major, what would you do?

08:24.587 --> 08:26.756
If it was me ...

08:29.091 --> 08:30.718
I'd go.

08:30.801 --> 08:33.179
Get out. Am I going 
bald right back here?

08:34.429 --> 08:37.683
Man, I am one good-lookin' 
son of a bitch.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.727
Don't you ever die.

08:39.809 --> 08:45.107
Die. That's exactly the concept
you gotta work tonight.

08:45.191 --> 08:48.569
You put a drop of this clove oil
under your eyes,

08:48.653 --> 08:50.655
and you let 'em sting and well up.

08:50.738 --> 08:54.450
You get your nurse alone,
take a breath,

08:54.534 --> 09:00.957
let her see your eyes glisten, and say,
"Baby, they're training me for war,

09:01.040 --> 09:03.918
and I don't know what'll happen,

09:04.001 --> 09:07.213
but if I die tomorrow, 
I want to know ...

09:07.296 --> 09:11.259
that we lived all we could tonight."

09:11.342 --> 09:13.261
Come on, guys.
We got nurses waitin'.

09:13.344 --> 09:16.138
Come on, before the 
rest of his hair falls out.

09:16.222 --> 09:20.935
- How could you do this?
- Well, Doolittle assigned me.

09:21.018 --> 09:24.272
He wanted me to get
some real combat training in.

09:24.355 --> 09:26.899
Well, guess what.
It's not training over there.

09:26.983 --> 09:30.111
It's war. Where the losers die,
and there aren't any winners,

09:30.194 --> 09:32.697
just guys who turn into
broken-down wrecks like my father.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.283
I understand that, Danny.
But I feel like I got a duty to go.

09:35.366 --> 09:39.287
Don't preach to me about duty, dammit.
I wear the same uniform you do.

09:39.370 --> 09:42.123
Now, if trouble wants me,
I'm ready for it.

09:42.206 --> 09:45.501
- But why go looking for it?
- God, Danny, come on.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.795
I'm gonna be 25.
I might as well be an old man.

09:47.878 --> 09:50.464
They're gonna have me
bein' a flight instructor.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.884
I don't wanna teach loops and barrel 
rolls. I wanna be a combat fighter.

09:53.968 --> 09:58.306
Hey, come on. The nurses
can't dance by themselves.

09:58.389 --> 10:00.141
Let's go.

10:09.191 --> 10:13.446
If the call of duty means seeing 150 
men in their underwear every day,

10:13.529 --> 10:15.990
we are here to serve.

10:16.073 --> 10:19.327
I can't believe it.
Saturday night in New York City.

10:19.410 --> 10:22.496
Do you know what they're doing
where I come from? Nothing.

10:22.580 --> 10:25.583
- Cow-tipping.
- That's why you joined the navy, hon.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.877
To get out of that dusty
little town and see the world.

10:27.960 --> 10:30.546
May I remind you, Barbara,
we're navy nurses, not tourists.

10:30.630 --> 10:34.800
I joined to do my patriotic duty
and to meet guys.

10:35.718 --> 10:37.094
Me too.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.431
- We're gonna have so much fun.
- Tell them the story, Evelyn.

10:40.514 --> 10:42.350
What?

10:42.433 --> 10:43.643
Come on. Tell us.

10:43.726 --> 10:45.186
It's such a long story.

10:45.269 --> 10:47.188
We got time.

10:47.271 --> 10:48.773
I saw it happen.

10:48.856 --> 10:51.400
Well, it was about four weeks ago.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.527
What do you think is better?

10:53.611 --> 10:55.988
All in the one cheek,
or spreading them out?

10:57.281 --> 10:58.366
OK.

10:58.449 --> 11:00.826
Fusco, Anthony.

11:05.581 --> 11:07.375
You all right, buddy?

11:07.458 --> 11:09.669
Sweetie, do you really
have to do this?

11:09.752 --> 11:12.630
I'm not gonna get yellow fever
in my barracks.

11:12.713 --> 11:15.841
No? If you'd rather, 
she can do it.

11:21.389 --> 11:23.391
Just gimme a minute.

11:23.474 --> 11:26.102
Honey, the government
says stick 'em, we stick 'em.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.858
Hey, Red, you all right?

11:34.235 --> 11:37.571
Eye exam number four?

11:37.655 --> 11:41.742
Listen, Doc, I have passed
a dozen medical checks.

11:41.826 --> 11:45.996
- You write that, they won't let me fly.
- Sorry, son.

11:46.080 --> 11:49.125
I'm gonna fail.
They're gonna take my wings away.

11:49.208 --> 11:51.460
No, they won't. Just relax.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.045
Read the bottom line, please.

11:53.129 --> 11:56.298
Keep practisin' the bottom line.
And don't worry. I'm right behind you.

11:56.382 --> 11:59.176
J-L-M-K-P-O ...

11:59.552 --> 12:01.137
Thank you.

12:03.055 --> 12:04.598
Next.

12:05.474 --> 12:07.143
Ma'am.

12:09.145 --> 12:10.730
J-L-M-K-P-O-E-T-X.

12:12.690 --> 12:15.526
- Eyes like an eagle, ma'am.
- Slow down, flyboy.

12:15.609 --> 12:18.320
And, instead of the bottom,
read the very top. Both eyes.

12:18.404 --> 12:19.572
Yeah.

12:22.533 --> 12:26.078
C ... Sorry, J.

12:26.162 --> 12:26.954
C.

12:27.037 --> 12:28.247
W.

12:28.330 --> 12:30.541
Q.

12:30.624 --> 12:32.376
Q.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.089
Read the bottom line again, please.

12:37.173 --> 12:41.218
But read it right to left,
and every other letter.

12:48.350 --> 12:49.518
E.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.146
X.

12:52.229 --> 12:54.523
- X-E.
- X-E.

12:54.607 --> 12:55.691
X-E, ma'am.

12:57.026 --> 12:59.612
Ma'am, I know how this looks.

12:59.695 --> 13:03.532
I'm sorry, Lieutenant, I really am.
But army and navy requires 20/20 vision.

13:03.616 --> 13:07.536
Oh, I ... It's not a problem
with my eyes. I mean, I can see.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.956
I can hit a running rabbit with a $3 pistol.
I got a problem with letters, that's all.

13:11.040 --> 13:14.251
Maybe after some schooling you could
come back and take the test again.

13:14.335 --> 13:17.838
No, I had schooling. The teachers
just never knew what to make of it.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.466
It's just letters. I mix 'em 
up sometimes. That's all.

13:20.549 --> 13:23.844
I just get 'em backward sometimes.

13:23.928 --> 13:28.557
Look here. My math and spatial reasoning
and my verbal scores are all excellent.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.601
But you barely passed
the written exam.

13:30.684 --> 13:32.812
Yeah, but he did pass it.
So, is it my turn now?

13:32.895 --> 13:35.064
- No, you'll wait your turn.
- Yes, ma'am.

13:35.147 --> 13:39.235
Ma'am, I'm never gonna
be an English teacher.

13:39.318 --> 13:42.571
But I know why I'm here. 
To be a pilot.

13:42.655 --> 13:45.825
And you don't dogfight with manuals.
You don't fly with gauges.

13:45.908 --> 13:49.620
It's all about feeling and speed and lettin'
that plane become like a part of your body.

13:49.703 --> 13:53.040
And that manual says that a guy who's 
a slow reader can't be a good pilot.

13:53.123 --> 13:56.710
That file says
I'm the best pilot in this room.

13:59.171 --> 14:04.134
Ma'am, please, don't take my wings.

14:05.761 --> 14:07.513
Well, I felt so bad.

14:07.596 --> 14:10.349
Evelyn, rotate to station three.

14:10.432 --> 14:13.811
I had no choice. I passed him.

14:15.771 --> 14:18.107
So, then this 
cocky pilot comes back.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.442
- Say, fella, are you enlisted?
- Yeah.

14:20.526 --> 14:22.611
"Yeah"? Boy,
you're talking to an officer.

14:22.695 --> 14:23.946
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

14:24.029 --> 14:25.781
- Give me that file.
- Yes, sir.

14:25.865 --> 14:27.658
- Parade rest.
- Yes, sir.

14:27.741 --> 14:31.954
- Ma'am, I didn't get a chance to thank you.
- Drop your skivvies.

14:32.037 --> 14:33.831
Oh, OK.

14:35.499 --> 14:38.878
- Just like this?
- That's fine.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.213
He did have a very cute butt.

14:41.297 --> 14:43.424
I know you didn't have to pass me,
and you did.

14:43.507 --> 14:46.635
And I just ... I didn't think
you'd understand, and you did.

14:46.719 --> 14:50.306
You know, you still
haven't said "Thank you."

14:50.389 --> 14:52.975
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

14:53.058 --> 14:55.978
Why'd you do it?
I mean, I'm just curious.

14:56.061 --> 15:00.149
- You're like my hero now.
- Actually, my father was a pilot.

15:00.232 --> 15:03.694
And I've seen first-hand what happens
when a pilot loses his wings.

15:03.777 --> 15:07.281
You know what?
Your father's my hero, then, too.

15:07.364 --> 15:10.868
In fact, as an officer,
I think it'd be my duty ...

15:10.951 --> 15:13.954
to take my new hero's
daughter out tonight just to ...

15:15.706 --> 15:19.793
- Gosh, did I poke too deep?
- I think you hit the bone there.

15:21.253 --> 15:22.630
You are so mean.

15:24.882 --> 15:29.803
What? So is there any chance
that you might, kind of, sort of,

15:29.887 --> 15:32.473
you know, like me, or ...?

15:32.556 --> 15:34.767
How did you guess?

15:36.810 --> 15:40.856
They never taught us
how to deal with this feeling.

15:43.233 --> 15:45.152
What feeling?

15:46.195 --> 15:49.365
Well, it's kind of like this.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.619
Well, he was getting fresh,
so I poked him again.

15:53.702 --> 15:57.665
All right, Romeo.
I want to get this over with.

15:58.666 --> 15:59.917
Hold on a second.

16:00.000 --> 16:03.504
Miss, I really, really lick you.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.049
What did he mean?

16:07.132 --> 16:08.801
Like you.

16:08.884 --> 16:10.094
I didn't mean to say that.

16:10.177 --> 16:11.387
And I just ...

16:11.470 --> 16:13.847
I just want to ask you, please,
if I can donate dinner.

16:13.931 --> 16:16.016
He started to act very strange.

16:16.100 --> 16:19.061
Or, well, buy you dinner.

16:19.144 --> 16:22.189
This isn't your chart.

16:22.898 --> 16:26.944
No. That's the ...
this fellow over here's.

16:27.027 --> 16:29.863
- I think he left.
- Have you already had this shot?

16:29.947 --> 16:32.825
Yeah, well, once already.

16:34.118 --> 16:36.578
Well, I wanted ...
I mean, can I ask you out?

16:36.662 --> 16:38.664
No!

16:38.747 --> 16:40.916
And he just went wham!

16:44.586 --> 16:46.213
What'd you do to him?

16:47.006 --> 16:49.675
Poor guy.

16:56.056 --> 16:58.600
My God. Are you OK?

16:58.684 --> 17:01.228
Yeah. I'm fine. I feel great.

17:01.311 --> 17:05.733
This is just standard
precautionary thing.

17:05.816 --> 17:10.529
Look, I got some genuine
French champagne from France.

17:10.612 --> 17:13.281
I thought, you know,
maybe we could celebrate.

17:13.365 --> 17:15.742
Celebrate what?

17:15.826 --> 17:19.538
I don't know.
You being my hero, for one.

17:21.707 --> 17:24.835
OK. Why not?

17:28.422 --> 17:30.215
I wanted to thank you.

17:30.299 --> 17:34.303
And I just wanted to put your 
mind at ease about passing me,

17:34.386 --> 17:37.473
because I really do think
you did this country a service.

17:37.556 --> 17:39.850
I am a great flier.

17:41.018 --> 17:43.979
And if you have a fault,
which you obviously don't,

17:44.063 --> 17:46.648
it's modesty.

17:46.732 --> 17:50.652
No. If I have a fault it's candour.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.156
You are just so ...

17:57.034 --> 17:59.286
Cork just got away from me.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.130
God, it hurts.

18:11.131 --> 18:13.425
It hurts something fierce.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.886
I'm sorry.

18:15.969 --> 18:17.971
It's bleeding.

18:19.890 --> 18:22.851
- Lay still.
- I ruined everything. It hurts.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.771
- It's cold.
- It'll stop the bleeding.

18:25.854 --> 18:29.650
- I can't breathe.
- Lay still.

18:33.570 --> 18:35.948
You are so beautiful it hurts.

18:37.116 --> 18:42.538
- It's your nose that hurts.
- No. I think it's my heart.

18:51.046 --> 18:52.965
And then I kissed him.

18:53.799 --> 18:58.303
Evelyn. That's the most 
romantic story I ever heard.

18:59.304 --> 19:03.892
It's been the most romantic
four weeks and two days of my life.

19:03.976 --> 19:05.769
I'm so jealous.

19:25.164 --> 19:29.710
- Hello, Lieutenant. It's good to see you.
- You, too, Lieutenant.

19:29.793 --> 19:31.170
Pick a hand.

19:35.090 --> 19:36.884
It's beautiful.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.679
What's in your other hand?

19:40.762 --> 19:42.264
Mine.

19:44.266 --> 19:47.269
Well, it took me six hours
to fold these.

19:52.566 --> 19:54.610
I want you to meet my friends.

19:54.693 --> 19:57.863
Rafe, this is Martha,
Barbara, Sandra ...

19:57.946 --> 20:00.407
- Hi. I'm Betty.
- Hi.

20:00.490 --> 20:03.035
Would you happen 
to have any friends?

20:04.328 --> 20:06.455
Take your pick.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.123
Hi.

20:32.648 --> 20:35.984
We ever get in this war
and somethin' happens to me,

20:36.068 --> 20:38.904
I can't tell you how good
it makes me feel to know ...

20:38.987 --> 20:43.158
that someone as sweet as you will be 
there to nurse me back to health.

20:43.242 --> 20:48.163
- Good, but we're not in the war yet.
- OK. That was a bad line.

20:48.247 --> 20:49.581
Hi.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.210
I'm Red.

20:53.293 --> 20:54.962
Red ...

20:57.589 --> 20:59.508
Strange.

20:59.591 --> 21:02.010
- Your last name's Strange?
- She's all yours, soldier.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.680
No. It's Winkle.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.183
Red is such a ladies' man.

21:08.267 --> 21:11.770
- Do you always stutter?
- No. Only when I'm ...

21:13.230 --> 21:15.148
She's totally buying it.

21:15.232 --> 21:16.358
- Nervous?
- Yeah.

21:16.441 --> 21:19.194
Why can't I get
something like that?

21:26.451 --> 21:28.036
Hello.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.246
Hi.

21:29.329 --> 21:32.749
Danny seems kind of shy
around the girls.

21:34.167 --> 21:39.214
It's not that he's shy. He's just a 
little unsure of himself, you know.

21:39.298 --> 21:44.928
His old man used to run him down a lot.
Get him in a plane, he's sure of himself.

21:45.012 --> 21:49.933
He's like my brother. He's like
my best friend. He's my right hand.

21:50.017 --> 21:54.396
Which at the moment
is a long way south of my waist.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.024
I'm sorry.

21:57.107 --> 22:00.819
- I guess I lost a little altitude.
- Yeah, I guess you did.

22:00.902 --> 22:02.446
Excuse me.

22:16.960 --> 22:19.338
You and me, we got to talk.

22:19.421 --> 22:23.050
So, the rumour is the navy's
shipping us to Pearl Harbor.

22:23.133 --> 22:25.052
Well, won't be so bad.

22:25.135 --> 22:27.721
It's about as far from 
the fighting as you can get.

22:27.804 --> 22:30.098
You'll get a suntan.

22:30.182 --> 22:33.352
So maybe the army'll
post you guys there, too.

22:33.435 --> 22:37.439
You are a super special woman.

22:37.522 --> 22:39.358
And, well ...

22:40.984 --> 22:45.072
Well, they're training me
to be a big bad warrior, and ...

22:50.077 --> 22:54.706
So, I mean, you never know
what might happen tomorrow, or ...

22:55.707 --> 22:57.751
or any day after that, you know?

22:57.834 --> 22:59.836
So ...

23:00.420 --> 23:03.423
God, we need to make
tonight super-special.

23:04.883 --> 23:06.968
Why are you crying?

23:07.052 --> 23:10.347
I guess it's the thought that I 
might not ever get to see you again.

23:10.430 --> 23:13.392
Dry your eyes, toots. 
Tonight, you're mine.

23:13.475 --> 23:18.480
I don't want to be with a crowd tonight.
I just want to be alone with you.

23:19.481 --> 23:23.151
Well, how does New York Harbor
by moonlight sound?

23:25.445 --> 23:30.409
- Are you gonna be a bad influence?
- Of course I'm a bad influence.

23:30.492 --> 23:34.704
Let's see if we can commandeer this vessel
cos we're officers of the US Government.

23:34.788 --> 23:36.498
Not for long, we won't be.

23:47.551 --> 23:49.886
One day, we'll take a trip
on a boat like that.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.346
Would you like that?

23:51.430 --> 23:55.559
We'll be dressing for cocktails
and walk into the grand salon.

23:55.642 --> 24:00.230
No one's talking about war.
They're just dancing to Cole Porter.

24:00.313 --> 24:02.315
- I'll have to get a tux.
- Yeah.

24:06.611 --> 24:09.364
Come on. There you go.
All aboard.

24:09.448 --> 24:13.952
- You're out of your mind.
- Yeah. Careful now. Here, sit down.

24:14.828 --> 24:17.497
Now, let's see here.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.085
There we go.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.173
See, this is as close as
I could get you to your ship.

24:26.256 --> 24:28.800
So, at least I tried, right?

24:30.302 --> 24:32.679
Actually, you know what?
This is better.

24:32.762 --> 24:34.598
Yeah, it is.

24:35.682 --> 24:38.143
God, you're pretty.

24:56.995 --> 24:59.498
What's gonna become
of us all, Rafe?

25:01.249 --> 25:05.587
Well, the future's not
exactly in our hands, is it?

25:05.670 --> 25:08.381
No. I guess you're right.

25:20.727 --> 25:23.939
- My God. Are you all right?
- Yeah, are you?

25:24.022 --> 25:25.690
That was not part of the date.

25:32.906 --> 25:35.867
- Watch your step.
- Thank you.

25:36.785 --> 25:40.789
- Evelyn!
- Guys, come up. Come on up.

25:40.872 --> 25:43.667
Come up. We're in 321.

25:43.750 --> 25:45.669
There's something I gotta tell you.

25:45.752 --> 25:51.424
You got no secrets from me, Lieutenant.
I've seen your medical chart.

25:57.055 --> 26:00.350
This can't be good,
or it wouldn't be so hard to say.

26:00.433 --> 26:02.310
Yep.

26:03.311 --> 26:06.982
- I gotta go away.
- We're all going away.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.817
Yeah.

26:08.900 --> 26:15.532
But I'm going to the war, tomorrow.
I'm flying with the Eagle Squadron.

26:15.615 --> 26:19.869
It's an outfit the British
started for American pilots.

26:21.037 --> 26:23.999
I don't understand.

26:24.082 --> 26:28.169
You're in the US army.
How could they order you to go?

26:28.253 --> 26:31.715
They didn't order me. 
I volunteered.

26:37.345 --> 26:39.848
But I passed you.

26:39.931 --> 26:42.183
I let you through.

26:42.267 --> 26:45.520
And now you volunteer for the 
most dangerous place you could go?

26:45.604 --> 26:50.025
It's not your responsibility,
not your choice.

26:50.108 --> 26:52.986
Flying's the only thing 
I ever wanted to do.

26:53.069 --> 26:56.990
I mean, everything in my life
has led me up to this point.

26:59.909 --> 27:02.329
Meeting you.

27:04.956 --> 27:07.167
I love you.

27:08.418 --> 27:10.587
I love you so much.

27:14.132 --> 27:16.134
Let's go inside.

27:23.058 --> 27:25.352
All right. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

27:25.435 --> 27:30.857
I can't do this. This just ...
It's not right. I'm sorry. I just ...

27:30.940 --> 27:36.029
See, I can't do this.
I mean, I can. I want to.

27:36.112 --> 27:38.406
I'm not trying to be noble,
you know.

27:38.490 --> 27:43.078
Or not saying I know what would happen
or just ... I need to stop talking.

27:43.161 --> 27:46.498
I just don't want ... I just don't 
want it to be like everybody else.

27:46.581 --> 27:50.418
I don't want you to have anything 
about tonight that you regret.

27:50.502 --> 27:54.089
I mean, it's been the most
incredible night of my life,

27:54.172 --> 27:56.216
and I don't want to ruin that.

27:56.299 --> 27:58.301
You couldn't ruin it.

28:00.261 --> 28:05.642
If I had one more night to live,
I'd want to spend it with you.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.771
See, that's what 
I want to come home to.

28:09.854 --> 28:13.775
That's what I want to have
to think about and dream about.

28:13.858 --> 28:17.445
I want to know that the best part 
of my life is still ahead of me.

28:18.405 --> 28:20.156
Look.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.575
Don't ...

28:22.659 --> 28:25.995
Could you not come see me off?

28:26.079 --> 28:30.667
Because saying goodbye
to you once is hard enough.

28:32.752 --> 28:35.088
Here.

28:37.590 --> 28:38.842
Take this.

28:38.925 --> 28:41.553
Why?
You think it looks good on me?

28:46.558 --> 28:48.727
I will come back.

29:24.512 --> 29:26.848
I thought you said
you told her not to come.

29:26.931 --> 29:28.683
Yeah, I did.

29:28.767 --> 29:32.687
- Why are you looking for her, then?
- It's my test.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.856
If I tell her not to come,
and she comes anyway ...

29:34.939 --> 29:36.691
then I know she loves me.

29:36.775 --> 29:40.570
All aboard. Track 57.

29:44.282 --> 29:48.119
If anything happens to me,

29:48.203 --> 29:52.540
I want you to be the one 
to tell her. All right?

29:52.624 --> 29:57.128
You just make sure and come back
for the both of us, all right?

29:58.129 --> 30:00.465
OK.

30:08.932 --> 30:11.601
- See you when I get back.
- Yeah.

30:15.355 --> 30:17.065
Good hunting, Rafe.

30:40.547 --> 30:41.673
Evelyn.

31:01.276 --> 31:03.278
She loves me.

31:05.905 --> 31:10.869
The German Luftwaffe relentlessly 
bombards downtown London,

31:10.952 --> 31:14.372
while Churchill's Royal Air Force
is in a deadly struggle ...

31:14.455 --> 31:17.625
to maintain control 
of the British skies.

31:39.939 --> 31:42.483
This is a real mess.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.695
Lieutenant McCawley
reporting for duty, sir.

31:47.655 --> 31:50.992
Good. We'll get you
settled into your quarters,

31:51.075 --> 31:54.329
and then introduce you
to the crate you'll be flying.

31:54.412 --> 31:57.874
Yes, sir. Well, if y'all
are patching up bullet holes here ...

31:57.957 --> 32:00.543
maybe we ought to skip housekeeping
and get me in an airplane.

32:00.627 --> 32:03.796
Two didn't come back, sir.
We counted only 11.

32:10.511 --> 32:14.599
Are all Yanks as anxious as you to 
get themselves killed, Pilot Officer?

32:14.682 --> 32:17.894
Not anxious to die, sir.
Just anxious to matter.

32:23.775 --> 32:26.110
This is yours.

32:27.195 --> 32:28.696
Good chap.

32:28.780 --> 32:32.992
Didn't die till he'd landed
and shut down his engine.

32:46.172 --> 32:49.008
Please be seated, gentlemen.

32:51.052 --> 32:53.513
I'm afraid I'm in a bad mood.

32:54.347 --> 32:58.768
Churchill and Stalin
are asking me what I'm asking you.

32:58.851 --> 33:03.690
How long is America going to pretend
the world is not at war?

33:03.773 --> 33:07.902
We've increased food and oil shipments,
Mr. President, and as far as I know ...

33:07.986 --> 33:13.032
What they really need are tanks, planes,
bullets, bombs, and men to fight.

33:13.116 --> 33:18.788
But our people think Hitler and 
his Nazi thugs are Europe's problem.

33:19.706 --> 33:22.709
We have to do more.

33:22.792 --> 33:26.462
Send the Brits and Russians more of
our ships and anti-aircraft weapons.

33:26.546 --> 33:30.049
- And keep cannibalising the Pacific Fleet?
- What choice do we have?

33:30.133 --> 33:34.887
We're building refrigerators
while our enemies build bombs.

34:43.664 --> 34:45.248
This is so exciting.

34:45.333 --> 34:47.752
You know there's about
100 ships on Pearl.

34:47.835 --> 34:49.253
How many sailors per ship?

34:49.337 --> 34:54.217
It depends. More on a battleship
than a sub. But say, on average 2,000.

34:54.300 --> 34:57.512
Then there's the fliers,
the marines, base personnel.

34:57.595 --> 35:01.474
- I'm still working on the sailors.
- Girls, I think the odds are in your favour.

35:01.557 --> 35:03.351
Yeah, like 4,000 to one.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.770
It's paradise.

35:05.853 --> 35:07.855
See you on the beach, boys.

35:09.065 --> 35:10.483
We're in Hawaii.

35:17.990 --> 35:21.577
You're not supposed to paint titties
on the side of my airplanes.

35:21.661 --> 35:26.124
- And if you do, don't make 'em lopsided.
- They were lopsided, Earl.

35:26.207 --> 35:27.458
Look, it says right here:

35:27.542 --> 35:31.796
"Never ride waves amongst
rocks or submerged pilings."

35:31.879 --> 35:33.548
See, it says you shouldn't do that.

35:33.631 --> 35:36.634
How do you know they're
submerged if they're submerged?

35:36.717 --> 35:39.262
Gooz, what in the hell
are you doing?

35:39.345 --> 35:41.264
Just trying to fix
this surfboard thing.

35:41.347 --> 35:43.474
He keeps taking chunks off 
his nose on the rocks.

35:43.558 --> 35:45.935
On my day off, I'm working
on my new invention ―

35:46.018 --> 35:48.729
the Gooz Cruise Fin.

35:48.813 --> 35:52.483
I'm gonna be a rich fella. Every surfboard
in the nation's gonna need one.

35:52.567 --> 35:55.111
Yeah? Well,
you're gonna need a broom.

35:55.194 --> 35:58.531
Check out these new recruits.

35:59.740 --> 36:02.160
- Hi.
- Aloha.

36:02.243 --> 36:04.620
Y'all pilots?

36:04.704 --> 36:08.875
We're working on it.
It's a lot of switches and stuff.

36:12.336 --> 36:14.797
- Pride of the Pacific.
- Who are you?

36:16.382 --> 36:17.967
Terrors of the skies.

36:20.553 --> 36:21.679
Welcome, ladies.

36:21.762 --> 36:23.389
Hi.

36:23.472 --> 36:28.394
I have to deal with toasty sunburnt 
rump before I can show you around.

36:33.274 --> 36:35.276
Dear Evelyn.

36:35.359 --> 36:37.987
It's different than I thought
it would be here.

36:38.070 --> 36:39.697
It's cold ―

36:39.780 --> 36:44.660
so cold it goes deep
into your bones.

36:44.744 --> 36:47.705
There is one place
I can go to find warmth.

36:47.788 --> 36:50.082
That is to think of you.

36:50.166 --> 36:53.628
I just wish I could be
back there with you.

36:55.922 --> 36:58.341
It's not easy making friends.

36:58.424 --> 37:01.719
Two days ago, I had a beer
with a couple of the RAF pilots.

37:01.802 --> 37:05.181
Yesterday,
both of them got killed.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.861
Dear Rafe.

37:18.945 --> 37:21.530
I miss you so much.

37:21.614 --> 37:25.451
It's so strange to be
half a world away from you.

37:26.786 --> 37:29.872
I'm right on his tail.

37:34.335 --> 37:36.003
Got one.

37:37.129 --> 37:39.799
Every night I look 
at the sunset ...

37:39.882 --> 37:43.552
and try to draw the last ounce
of heat from its long day ...

37:43.636 --> 37:47.223
and send it from my heart to yours.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.606
Family?

37:55.690 --> 37:57.900
Girl, sir.

37:57.984 --> 38:00.027
The girl.

38:01.821 --> 38:05.658
A lot of people frown on the Yanks
for not being in this war yet.

38:05.741 --> 38:07.576
I'd just like to say,

38:07.660 --> 38:10.579
if there are many more
back home like you,

38:10.663 --> 38:14.208
God help anyone who goes
to war with America.

38:19.630 --> 38:21.507
Ten hut!

38:21.590 --> 38:23.009
Attention on deck.

38:23.092 --> 38:26.220
Admiral Kimmel, Commander-in-Chief,
Pacific Fleet, on deck.

38:26.304 --> 38:29.515
- Sharp presentation, Captain.
- Thank you, Admiral Kimmel.

38:29.598 --> 38:32.184
For four months now Washington's
been blowing pink smoke ...

38:32.268 --> 38:34.061
about the threat from Japan.

38:34.145 --> 38:39.358
Could make us lose our fighting edge.
I'm determined not to let that happen.

38:44.196 --> 38:49.618
With your permission, Captain.
Admiral, urgent, from Washington.

38:52.788 --> 38:56.125
I'm supposed to keep this fleet
battle-ready to take on the Japanese,

38:56.208 --> 38:58.461
cover half the damn globe.

38:58.544 --> 39:01.505
Now they want me to transfer
another 12 destroyers to the Atlantic.

39:01.589 --> 39:05.134
- Don't they know what we're facing here?
- They feel Europe is the greater danger.

39:05.217 --> 39:08.137
I'm assuming these risk
assessments include Hawaii.

39:08.220 --> 39:11.140
Pearl Harbor is too shallow
for an aerial torpedo attack.

39:11.223 --> 39:15.019
We're surrounded by sub nets.
All we need worry about is sabotage,

39:15.102 --> 39:18.439
so we bunched our planes together
to make them easier to protect.

39:18.522 --> 39:20.608
Distance is our ally, Admiral.

39:20.691 --> 39:24.695
You analysts got it
all figured out, don't you?

39:24.779 --> 39:28.908
The smart enemy hits you
exactly where you think you're safe.

40:40.104 --> 40:41.689
Incoming.

40:52.199 --> 40:56.370
I fixed the hydraulics and electrics, sir,
but the oil hoses still need attention.

40:56.454 --> 40:59.165
- Just crank it, Ian.
- God speed you, sir.

41:08.466 --> 41:12.303
Red section, take the bombers.
Blue section, look out for the fighters.

41:12.386 --> 41:16.390
Bombers dead ahead. Let's drop 
in and give 'em a reception.

41:19.393 --> 41:23.147
Red Two, follow my lead, high side.
Go right at the lead bomber.

41:23.230 --> 41:25.441
Following you, Red One.

41:32.448 --> 41:33.574
Good hit. Good hit.

41:38.621 --> 41:42.166
Red One, coming around,
reset for the kill.

41:43.250 --> 41:45.377
I have the middle bomber.

41:48.714 --> 41:50.299
Hammer down.

41:55.387 --> 41:57.556
We got him. Nice shot, Red Two.

41:58.224 --> 42:00.059
I got two MEs dead ahead.

42:04.980 --> 42:07.274
I'm on him. I'm on his tail.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.276
Hammer down.

42:11.111 --> 42:12.905
I got one of them.

42:24.542 --> 42:25.793
I got another one.

42:25.876 --> 42:29.463
Red One, you got fighters
all over your tail.

42:29.547 --> 42:32.174
I'm under fire. I'm taking fire.

42:34.260 --> 42:37.346
Red One, get out of there.
Pull up. Pull up.

42:43.769 --> 42:45.938
I got an oil leak.

42:48.983 --> 42:50.818
Can't see a damn thing.

42:53.153 --> 42:57.449
I can't bail.
My canopy's stuck. I can't bail out.

43:07.084 --> 43:08.627
He's on my tail, Red Two.

43:12.464 --> 43:14.466
I'm hit. I'm hit.

43:22.474 --> 43:24.476
Mayday! Mayday!

43:29.148 --> 43:31.317
My God.

43:44.997 --> 43:48.417
- I'm no good at church.
- What do you mean, sweetie?

43:48.500 --> 43:51.253
When I'm up there getting
my slate wiped clean,

43:51.337 --> 43:55.382
- I'm thinking how to dirty it up again.
- Wow, this from a virgin.

43:55.466 --> 43:57.301
I gotta inventory supplies.

43:57.384 --> 44:01.180
Kill me now.
Could you be any more boring?

44:01.263 --> 44:03.515
Don't bother.
Sunday, she writes Rafe ―

44:03.599 --> 44:06.060
ten pages instead of the usual five.

44:07.269 --> 44:10.397
Gosh, I wish I was in love.

44:12.441 --> 44:14.652
Hey, sweetheart.

44:14.735 --> 44:17.112
She hates me.

44:17.196 --> 44:21.283
- Good to see you, Red.
- Good to see you, too, Betty.

44:21.367 --> 44:23.994
You wanna come for a ride?
Come on.

44:24.078 --> 44:26.372
Yeah, I'll be your chauffeur.

44:38.133 --> 44:43.055
- That-a-boy. Be a mad dog.
- You hit pretty hard, for a cook.

44:45.140 --> 44:49.144
- All right, Walker, who you got?
- I'll take the cook.

44:49.228 --> 44:51.605
Why? You don't like money?

44:53.399 --> 44:55.150
Come on. Get out there now.

44:58.529 --> 45:00.989
- I'll put five on it.
- Done.

45:02.449 --> 45:05.160
Against a mechanic?
That guy craps rivets.

45:05.244 --> 45:08.956
How's it feel up from the engine room?
Sunlight botherin' you?

45:12.376 --> 45:14.420
Man, he's getting all busted up.

45:15.254 --> 45:16.630
Move. Move.

45:18.173 --> 45:21.176
Come here. We gotta talk.
Get down here.

45:21.260 --> 45:23.387
He can't hurt us.

45:23.470 --> 45:24.596
He can hurt us.

45:24.680 --> 45:28.016
- He cut us. We bleeding.
- Bleeding?

45:28.100 --> 45:31.311
That's a scratch. See this? This 
is the hard-earned greenbacks ...

45:31.395 --> 45:33.897
of every pot-scrubbin' 
chop in this fleet.

45:33.981 --> 45:37.526
Now if we don't win, Teeny here
has to find another battleship.

45:37.609 --> 45:40.571
I'm not going back to the 
Arizona empty-handed.

45:40.654 --> 45:42.823
Don't worry about the money.

45:42.906 --> 45:48.996
I'll send that smug engine-fixin' snipe
back below decks where he belong.

45:49.079 --> 45:50.706
We the man.

45:50.789 --> 45:54.001
He slapped your momma.
Be a son of a bitch.

46:02.009 --> 46:04.470
Look at this. All right, Dorie.

46:16.482 --> 46:19.485
That's enough. That's enough.

46:23.822 --> 46:26.200
- Where's my money?
- Nah, fight's rigged.

46:26.283 --> 46:28.827
We're rich.

46:31.455 --> 46:34.750
- How'd you get this?
- Boxing.

46:34.833 --> 46:38.295
- Did you win?
- Yes, ma'am.

46:38.378 --> 46:41.298
What do you get for winning?

46:42.299 --> 46:44.301
Respect.

46:48.639 --> 46:53.143
So, why do you have to fight
with your fists to get respect?

46:53.227 --> 46:57.606
I left my momma in Texas and 
joined the navy to see the world,

46:57.689 --> 46:59.775
become a man.

46:59.858 --> 47:02.611
They made me a cook.

47:02.694 --> 47:07.115
Not even that. I clean up 
after other sailors eat.

47:07.991 --> 47:11.453
Two years, they never even
let me fire a weapon.

47:13.247 --> 47:16.416
Well, let's hope 
you never have to.

47:16.500 --> 47:17.751
Yes, ma'am.

47:17.835 --> 47:21.380
- You take care, Petty Officer Miller.
- You too, ma'am.

48:05.090 --> 48:07.759
You know, he taught me to fly.

48:07.843 --> 48:10.596
I always knew that no matter
what trouble I got into,

48:10.679 --> 48:13.181
I'd never be in it alone.

48:13.265 --> 48:15.684
He'd be there with me.

48:17.769 --> 48:21.315
He was always pushing me
to be better and faster.

48:23.358 --> 48:26.361
He told me you were a great flier.

48:27.195 --> 48:32.367
It was the same night he told me
he'd volunteered to go to England.

48:33.619 --> 48:35.329
Volunteered?

48:36.330 --> 48:39.833
He told me he'd been assigned.

48:45.380 --> 48:48.133
He was always 
trying to protect me.

48:52.220 --> 48:55.891
But you know what? I look at myself
in the mirror in this uniform,

48:55.974 --> 48:58.810
and I still don't know who I am.

48:59.811 --> 49:02.731
I look like a hero,

49:02.814 --> 49:05.484
but I don't feel like it.

49:07.319 --> 49:09.529
Rafe ...

49:10.530 --> 49:14.284
He always looked the part, 
didn't he?

49:14.368 --> 49:16.620
He couldn't wait to be one.

49:39.559 --> 49:42.562
To Rafe McCawley.

49:43.438 --> 49:49.945
The best pilot
and the best friend I ever knew,

49:50.028 --> 49:53.115
or ever will know.

49:55.909 --> 49:57.536
To Rafe.

51:03.518 --> 51:07.522
Look at this. The Japanese are flooding 
the Pacific with radio traffic.

51:07.606 --> 51:10.400
Everywhere from the Panama Canal
to southeast Asia.

51:10.484 --> 51:14.112
- There's no logical pattern, Captain.
- No. There's always logic.

51:14.780 --> 51:16.406
They know we read their mail.

51:16.490 --> 51:20.660
They're trying to make us think
their fleet is moving south.

51:20.744 --> 51:22.579
I'm not buying it.

51:22.662 --> 51:25.665
Something's up.

51:25.749 --> 51:29.544
Otherwise, why would they take
the trouble to bullshit me?

51:44.017 --> 51:48.480
Evelyn, I signed for
these letters for you today.

51:48.563 --> 51:50.982
They're from England.

51:51.066 --> 51:54.736
- They're from Rafe.
- I'm sorry, Ev.

51:54.820 --> 51:57.948
You know how long
it takes mail to get here.

52:11.211 --> 52:14.005
- Hurry up.
- Show time, boys. Come on.

52:17.384 --> 52:20.971
America still awaits Japan's 
response to peace proposals.

52:21.054 --> 52:23.640
Ambassador Nomura
arrives in Washington ...

52:23.723 --> 52:27.686
in what could hopefully guarantee
continued peace in the Pacific.

52:27.769 --> 52:29.938
On the British front,
Churchill declares:

52:30.021 --> 52:33.400
"Give us the tools,
and we will finish the job."

52:35.610 --> 52:37.320
The RAF has fought bravely ...

52:37.404 --> 52:42.993
against Hitler's ambition
to rule the skies over the Channel.

52:43.076 --> 52:46.580
Victory does not come
without sacrifice.

52:48.790 --> 52:50.000
Evelyn.

52:50.083 --> 52:51.501
Danny.

52:51.585 --> 52:53.587
Some comedy, huh?

52:56.464 --> 52:58.633
It's been a while.

52:58.717 --> 53:04.181
- I've been logging a lot of flight hours.
- I've kinda been avoiding you, too.

53:04.264 --> 53:05.974
Yeah.

53:06.057 --> 53:08.226
- Look ...
- Do you ...?

53:08.310 --> 53:11.688
- Do you want to?
- Sure, yeah.

53:11.771 --> 53:14.858
I remember one time
when I was, like, seven years old.

53:14.941 --> 53:17.777
I was always building
gadgets and things.

53:17.861 --> 53:21.823
He wanted me to build him some wings
so he could fly like his daddy.

53:21.907 --> 53:25.035
I told him you can't fly
without some kind of engine.

53:25.118 --> 53:26.703
But he wouldn't listen.

53:26.786 --> 53:29.247
"Danny, never mind that,
just build 'em anyway."

53:29.331 --> 53:31.499
So I did.

53:31.583 --> 53:35.253
And I'm up there strapping these 
big ol' wings on his back ...

53:35.337 --> 53:39.633
that we made from paper and glue and
these massive silk bloomers that we stole.

53:39.716 --> 53:42.135
He looked so stupid, and I told him:

53:42.219 --> 53:44.554
"You can't jump off the barn
in these."

53:44.638 --> 53:46.306
And bam!

53:46.389 --> 53:49.017
He busted his leg on a backhoe.

53:54.189 --> 53:57.651
- God, I miss him.
- Yeah.

53:57.734 --> 54:00.946
But don't you think that Rafe 
wasn't back up there next day,

54:01.029 --> 54:06.117
cast and everything, telling me to
make some adjustments on those wings.

54:06.201 --> 54:09.579
Check this out. 
Crossroads of the Pacific.

54:09.663 --> 54:12.624
Tahiti, 1,700 miles.

54:12.707 --> 54:14.876
All right.

54:16.336 --> 54:18.338
Say, Betty,

54:22.342 --> 54:25.011
wou ...

54:26.137 --> 54:28.181
- No, Betty. Get up.
- What's going on, Red?

54:28.265 --> 54:31.017
- Stand up, please.
- What do you mean?

54:31.226 --> 54:33.019
Just stand up.

54:33.103 --> 54:35.146
Stand ...

54:38.566 --> 54:40.443
- Betty ...
- Red, come on.

54:40.527 --> 54:43.196
We got a dinner reservation.

54:45.699 --> 54:48.493
Can I get a minute?

54:48.576 --> 54:51.079
What's the matter, you sick?

54:51.788 --> 54:54.416
Can a guy propose?

54:57.168 --> 55:01.715
Am I talking too much?
Sometimes I do that, I'm sorry.

55:03.550 --> 55:04.926
Hold up.

55:05.010 --> 55:06.636
Look at this.

55:06.720 --> 55:08.263
Hello.

55:09.889 --> 55:12.100
- OK, let's get out of here.
- OK.

55:14.769 --> 55:17.147
I guess I should go.

55:17.230 --> 55:20.442
Don't let it be three months
before I see you again.

55:20.525 --> 55:22.736
- I had a good time.
- Yeah, me too.

55:24.821 --> 55:27.824
- Do you want me to walk you home?
- No, I'll be fine.

55:27.907 --> 55:29.784
No. Of course.

55:29.868 --> 55:32.078
- Good night.
- Good night.

55:43.465 --> 55:47.177
I was just wondering if maybe
I could come by sometime,

55:47.260 --> 55:50.013
get a cup of coffee 
or a piece of pie?

55:51.348 --> 55:54.017
What am I doing?

55:54.100 --> 55:55.769
OK.

55:59.314 --> 56:03.026
- You were asleep. I'm sorry.
- Danny?

56:03.109 --> 56:06.529
- Is something wrong?
- No. Nothing's wrong. No problem. Hi.

56:06.613 --> 56:09.157
It's just Danny.

56:09.240 --> 56:13.328
I just ... You forgot this.

56:16.373 --> 56:17.540
Thanks.

56:17.624 --> 56:21.544
It was good of you to take the 
trouble to drop it over now.

56:21.628 --> 56:23.880
Well, I thought you might need it.

56:23.963 --> 56:26.966
You know,
maybe tomorrow morning.

56:27.050 --> 56:32.138
- If ... Not that you wear this to work, but ...
- No. It's a hankie.

56:34.057 --> 56:37.310
Right, right. Yeah.

56:39.145 --> 56:43.983
Listen, I was thinking maybe
I could come by sometime.

56:44.067 --> 56:48.446
If I gave you a call,
could I come by sometime?

56:49.280 --> 56:51.533
Once, maybe, if you're not busy?

56:52.659 --> 56:53.868
Yeah, maybe.

56:53.952 --> 56:56.413
- Maybe?
- Maybe.

56:56.496 --> 56:57.747
OK. All right.

56:57.831 --> 57:00.917
- Thanks. Good night.
- Goodbye. Good night.

57:01.000 --> 57:03.503
You are such an idiot.

57:07.799 --> 57:10.135
Did you have fun last night?

57:10.218 --> 57:13.555
- It wasn't how it looked.
- And if it was, it'd be all right.

57:13.638 --> 57:16.599
It's been months. 
It's time to move on.

57:16.683 --> 57:19.060
- I am moving on.
- Ev, don't lie.

57:19.144 --> 57:22.647
All I know is, I hear you crying
when you think I'm asleep.

57:22.730 --> 57:25.525
When my dad left, I was too 
much for my mom to handle,

57:25.608 --> 57:28.778
so she sent me to 
live with my aunt.

57:28.862 --> 57:32.657
I thought my life was over, but you 
don't know where it's all gonna lead.

57:32.740 --> 57:36.327
If I hadn't run away and lied about 
my age and enlisted in the navy,

57:36.411 --> 57:39.456
I wouldn't have met Red, and,

57:39.539 --> 57:41.916
now he's my fiancé.

57:42.917 --> 57:45.170
God, I can't get 
used to that word.

57:45.253 --> 57:47.380
- It's only been 12 hours.
- Betty.

57:47.464 --> 57:49.632
Little Betty beat 
us all to the post.

57:49.716 --> 57:53.470
And this is ward three.
As you can see, no patients.

57:53.553 --> 57:55.430
Welcome to Hawaii.
I'll show you the bar.

57:55.513 --> 57:57.557
Sandra, new recruits to torture.

57:57.640 --> 58:00.685
- Come on. Excuse me, ladies?
- Hi.

58:02.520 --> 58:07.108
We're gonna wait two years until 
I'm 19, and Red can buy me a ring.

58:08.693 --> 58:13.740
Rafe sent his best friend to tell you
so you would be OK, so you can move on.

58:15.700 --> 58:18.119
You gotta go on living, Ev.

58:24.709 --> 58:26.461
Red.

58:27.212 --> 58:28.505
Sorry.

58:45.063 --> 58:47.273
Bye, Rafe.

58:49.400 --> 58:51.611
The Japanese fleet is missing.

58:51.694 --> 58:55.532
They're operating 
under radio silence.

58:55.615 --> 58:59.244
This footage was shot
four days ago on October 28th.

59:02.247 --> 59:06.167
We're sending scout planes in 
wider vectors all over the Pacific,

59:06.251 --> 59:07.669
but they get nothing.

59:07.752 --> 59:09.963
They could be anywhere in here.

59:10.880 --> 59:15.885
I don't understand how two whole
carrier divisions can just disappear.

59:21.266 --> 59:22.600
Clear.

59:32.443 --> 59:35.655
We're all over the page. We got
one wall-eyed and one pigeon-toed.

59:35.738 --> 59:38.366
- Anthony, tap in number six.
- All right.

59:38.449 --> 59:41.703
- Gooz, tap in number three.
- All right.

59:41.786 --> 59:44.789
Hey. We got a visitor.

59:44.872 --> 59:47.792
That ain't no 
navy-issue uniform, right?

59:47.875 --> 59:51.254
- Danny, it's Evelyn.
- Jesus.

59:52.255 --> 59:55.842
- You all right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

59:56.634 --> 01:00:01.889
- No. I think I'm fallin' for her.
- Wow. You know, I saw this coming.

01:00:03.975 --> 01:00:07.604
I didn't want this to happen.
It just kind of did. Can't help it.

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:10.148
She's gotta be with somebody.
It might as well be you.

01:00:10.231 --> 01:00:13.443
You telling me if you were dead and you
saw your best buddy doin' your girl,

01:00:13.526 --> 01:00:16.070
you wouldn't come back and beat
the living crap outta him?

01:00:16.154 --> 01:00:18.656
- Back off.
- I'd be back so fast.

01:00:18.740 --> 01:00:21.409
Danny's being a better friend
taking care of her himself.

01:00:21.492 --> 01:00:23.453
I got a girlfriend.

01:00:27.665 --> 01:00:31.419
- That's great.
- Come on, fellas. Let's split.

01:00:31.502 --> 01:00:34.756
Danny, whatever happens now
is just about you and her.

01:00:34.839 --> 01:00:37.508
You gotta try 
and forget about Rafe.

01:00:37.592 --> 01:00:42.180
Be careful, all right?
Ladies cloud the mind.

01:00:43.014 --> 01:00:45.308
- Thanks, Gooz.
- You're welcome.

01:00:47.226 --> 01:00:49.228
Hey, Danny.

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:53.399
Where's everybody going?

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:55.777
Just bein' discreet.

01:00:55.860 --> 01:00:58.237
Does it seem like everybody's
acting strange?

01:00:58.321 --> 01:01:00.073
No. No.

01:01:01.032 --> 01:01:02.450
Right.

01:01:03.868 --> 01:01:07.205
Well, maybe a little. Yeah.

01:01:08.122 --> 01:01:11.459
People in this outfit have way 
too much time on their hands.

01:01:11.542 --> 01:01:14.504
I hope they don't think there's 
something goin' on between us.

01:01:14.587 --> 01:01:18.383
No. I mean, no.
That would be embarrassing, right?

01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:19.967
Forgot my wrenches.

01:01:20.051 --> 01:01:24.138
- That would definitely be embarrassing.
- Yeah.

01:01:24.222 --> 01:01:27.141
- Forgot my wrenches.
- Hey.

01:01:27.225 --> 01:01:30.061
- He really doesn't have to leave.
- No.

01:01:30.144 --> 01:01:34.107
I'm just goin' 
out with the girls, so,

01:01:35.149 --> 01:01:38.319
- I guess I'll see you later.
- Yeah.

01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:42.490
- All right.
- Yeah, all right. I'll see you around.

01:01:42.573 --> 01:01:43.825
Shit.

01:01:44.742 --> 01:01:46.828
Evelyn.

01:01:46.911 --> 01:01:48.996
Have you ever seen
Pearl Harbor at sunset?

01:01:50.164 --> 01:01:53.418
- Of course.
- Well, from the air?

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.966
I could get kicked out of 
the military for this.

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:02.677
- Really?
- Yeah. Stay down.

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:24.490
The Hawaiians
called this harbor Wai Momi.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:28.119
- It means "water of pearls".
- It's so beautiful.

01:02:28.911 --> 01:02:32.290
My dad took me up a couple of times.
Just don't do what he did.

01:02:32.373 --> 01:02:35.126
- What do you call it when you flip over?
- A barrel roll?

01:02:35.209 --> 01:02:37.837
- Yeah.
- I won't.

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.018
- God.
- What do you think?

01:02:52.101 --> 01:02:53.811
I like that.

01:03:04.989 --> 01:03:07.742
That plane was supposed to be 
back here an hour ago.

01:03:07.825 --> 01:03:10.411
Hide in the parachute hangar.

01:03:49.408 --> 01:03:51.285
My heart is pounding.

01:04:38.666 --> 01:04:40.793
Danny, last night ...

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:42.920
No, that's terrible.

01:04:45.089 --> 01:04:47.550
Danny, we need to talk about this.

01:04:49.051 --> 01:04:50.595
Sir. Evelyn.

01:04:50.678 --> 01:04:53.556
- Danny.
- Hey. Hi.

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:56.100
Hi.

01:04:58.477 --> 01:05:02.523
I didn't sleep a wink last night.
I had to see you.

01:05:02.607 --> 01:05:07.445
Last night was crazy, I know,
but I'm not sorry. Are you?

01:05:09.488 --> 01:05:10.990
I don't know.

01:05:13.659 --> 01:05:16.913
Danny, I had a wonderful 
time last night.

01:05:16.996 --> 01:05:18.581
It's just all too fast.

01:05:18.664 --> 01:05:21.208
Listen, Evelyn, I was just down
at the beach this morning ...

01:05:21.292 --> 01:05:26.589
and I watched the sunrise, and I knew
that everything was gonna be different.

01:05:26.672 --> 01:05:31.802
That this was the start of something 
new. In this place, in this moment.

01:05:31.886 --> 01:05:35.181
And I don't care what
anybody else says, you know?

01:05:36.098 --> 01:05:38.392
How can I not feel this way?

01:05:40.394 --> 01:05:42.688
I kinda like you.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.234
You do?

01:05:51.322 --> 01:05:53.908
You have your tie on crooked.

01:05:56.494 --> 01:05:59.455
Everything's gonna be all right, OK?

01:06:00.831 --> 01:06:04.210
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:06:11.884 --> 01:06:16.055
Do you have any air tours
going through the valley of Oahu?

01:06:17.139 --> 01:06:18.683
You do?

01:06:30.903 --> 01:06:37.243
Aloha. This is KGMB in Honolulu on
another beautiful fall day here in paradise.

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.541
We have enough information.

01:06:45.584 --> 01:06:47.712
We are returning home.

01:07:16.782 --> 01:07:21.037
Do you ever wonder if this 
war's gonna catch up with us?

01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:23.706
Not a whole lot.

01:07:23.789 --> 01:07:29.003
Every moment we're not together,
you're up there training for it.

01:07:29.086 --> 01:07:32.339
Yeah, well, I'm training
for moments like these,

01:07:32.423 --> 01:07:35.885
cos I have no idea how I'm gonna 
get this car out of the sand.

01:07:35.968 --> 01:07:39.847
Evelyn, can you please come out of the
bathroom? You've been there for an hour.

01:07:39.930 --> 01:07:43.142
Evelyn. What are you
trying to do, look like me?

01:07:45.686 --> 01:07:48.397
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

01:07:48.481 --> 01:07:52.318
What's the matter?
No, you ...

01:07:52.401 --> 01:07:56.363
They call it the vacant sea. None of 
the major sea lanes go through it.

01:07:56.447 --> 01:08:00.659
You could bury the entire land mass
of Asia there and nobody would know.

01:08:00.743 --> 01:08:04.455
From there, they could attack anywhere.

01:08:04.538 --> 01:08:08.751
Our last signals intercept indicate that the 
Japanese task force is heading south ...

01:08:08.834 --> 01:08:10.628
towards the Philippines
or southeast Asia.

01:08:10.711 --> 01:08:13.005
But Captain Thurman
of Naval Intelligence here ...

01:08:13.089 --> 01:08:15.966
has his own theory
about the missing ships.

01:08:16.050 --> 01:08:20.554
Sir, I believe they'll try to hit us
where it'll hurt us the most ― Pearl Harbor.

01:08:20.638 --> 01:08:23.640
It's over 4,000 nautical miles
from Japan to Pearl.

01:08:23.724 --> 01:08:27.310
That's a long distance
to steam a navy, Captain.

01:08:28.895 --> 01:08:33.024
- Your theory is based on what?
- Well, it's what I would do.

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:35.986
That's not exactly
hard evidence, Captain Thurman.

01:08:36.069 --> 01:08:38.948
Admiral, if I had hard evidence,
we'd already be at war.

01:08:39.031 --> 01:08:42.076
Sir, we can read their diplomatic codes
faster than they can type them.

01:08:42.158 --> 01:08:45.578
Captain Thurman's cryptology team is 
still trying to crack the naval codes.

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:48.499
The intercepts have missing words
and garbled lines,

01:08:48.582 --> 01:08:52.294
so to explain the decrypts,
we have to try to interpret ...

01:08:52.377 --> 01:08:56.674
- what we think they're trying to do.
- Interpret? You mean guess.

01:08:56.756 --> 01:09:00.136
They use their 
informed intuition, sir.

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:03.180
We guess.
It's like playing chess in the dark.

01:09:03.264 --> 01:09:05.890
Any rumour, troop movement,
ship movement,

01:09:05.975 --> 01:09:08.978
spine-tingle, goose bump,
we pay attention to it.

01:09:09.060 --> 01:09:12.481
When I was in the Asiatic Fleet, the locals
used to try to get outside of a problem ...

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:13.941
to try to see the inside.

01:09:14.024 --> 01:09:17.194
I see a strike on Pearl. It's the 
worst thing that could happen.

01:09:17.278 --> 01:09:20.823
A blow to Pearl would devastate the 
Pacific Fleet's ability to make war.

01:09:20.906 --> 01:09:24.160
So, sir, you would have us
mobilise the entire fleet ...

01:09:24.243 --> 01:09:26.328
at the cost of millions of dollars,

01:09:26.412 --> 01:09:29.665
based on this spine-tingling
feeling of yours?

01:09:29.747 --> 01:09:34.336
No, sir. I understand my job is 
to gather and interpret material.

01:09:34.420 --> 01:09:37.339
Making difficult decisions
based on incomplete information ...

01:09:37.423 --> 01:09:40.216
from my limited decoding ability ...

01:09:40.301 --> 01:09:42.720
is your job, sir.

01:09:42.803 --> 01:09:47.057
Then break the damn naval code,
Captain, so I can make a better decision.

01:09:47.140 --> 01:09:50.144
Aye, sir. We are trying.

01:10:07.286 --> 01:10:10.080
I wonder if we shouldn't put
the Pacific Fleet on full alert.

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:21.550
In case the optimism of the Honolulu
Advertiser proves unfounded, gentlemen,

01:10:21.634 --> 01:10:25.137
what are General Short and the army
going to do about protecting my ships?

01:10:25.221 --> 01:10:29.225
Within a ten-mile radius of your harbour,
we have fighter planes here at Wheeler,

01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:31.602
bombers at Hickam,
and a training strip at Haleiwa.

01:10:41.904 --> 01:10:46.158
We've recently established a radar station
here that can detect planes 125 miles out.

01:10:46.242 --> 01:10:48.827
Which is a month old, Admiral,
and untested.

01:10:48.911 --> 01:10:51.664
I've seen these new 
radar screens, Major.

01:10:51.747 --> 01:10:55.125
There's no way of telling whether they're
ours, theirs, or a flock of damn birds.

01:10:57.336 --> 01:11:01.048
I'm intercepting a call from Tokyo
to somewhere close by Pearl.

01:11:01.131 --> 01:11:04.301
There's a call from Tokyo.
They say they don't know you.

01:11:06.720 --> 01:11:08.180
Hello?

01:11:14.645 --> 01:11:19.108
It's a local dentist.
He can see Pearl Harbor from his office.

01:11:19.191 --> 01:11:21.235
Are there many sailors around?

01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:30.494
The dentist says that the 
flat ships are not in port.

01:11:30.577 --> 01:11:33.289
They're talking about the weather.

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:35.499
He doesn't seem to know
who he's talking to.

01:11:35.582 --> 01:11:37.293
Hello?

01:11:37.376 --> 01:11:39.503
Hello?

01:11:39.586 --> 01:11:41.297
Hello?

01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.716
That was a strange call.

01:11:46.010 --> 01:11:47.761
Admiral, may I speak 
to you in private?

01:11:49.221 --> 01:11:52.474
Why would a spy use a phone?
They know we tap all international lines.

01:11:52.558 --> 01:11:54.727
Our listeners feel
it's probably not code talk.

01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:56.437
Someone in Japan 
is sneaking around,

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:59.231
asking a local citizen
the location of our carriers.

01:11:59.315 --> 01:12:03.986
Well, that makes me feel all warm inside.
Get the FBI on it immediately.

01:12:04.069 --> 01:12:06.322
Have we found
the goddamn Japanese fleet yet?

01:12:06.405 --> 01:12:08.907
No, Admiral. The bases
are looking all over the Pacific.

01:12:08.991 --> 01:12:12.995
So it could be rounding Diamond Head
and we wouldn't know a thing about it.

01:12:13.078 --> 01:12:14.747
Get on it.

01:12:48.739 --> 01:12:50.699
I'm alive.

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.951
This is the first
I could get word out.

01:13:53.303 --> 01:13:55.347
I told you I'd come back.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:00.727
Here, sit down.
Sit down. Come here.

01:14:00.811 --> 01:14:03.355
It's OK.

01:14:04.523 --> 01:14:06.859
It's all right.

01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:11.321
- You're real.
- Yeah.

01:14:12.698 --> 01:14:15.742
- I wished for this every day.
- I know. Me too.

01:14:15.826 --> 01:14:18.412
Every second. So did I.

01:14:18.495 --> 01:14:22.583
I thought you were dead. They said 
you were shot down in the sea.

01:14:22.666 --> 01:14:24.793
Yeah, I was.

01:14:24.877 --> 01:14:27.796
I was in the ocean.
It was so cold.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.090
I missed you.

01:14:30.174 --> 01:14:33.260
I got picked up
by a French fishing boat.

01:14:33.343 --> 01:14:36.305
I was in occupied France,
and I couldn't get word out.

01:14:36.388 --> 01:14:40.559
I'll tell you all about it, 
I promise. But I'm fine. I'm OK.

01:14:40.642 --> 01:14:42.603
And I'm here now.

01:14:42.686 --> 01:14:43.479
Evelyn.

01:14:43.562 --> 01:14:45.689
I just wanted to see you.

01:14:45.772 --> 01:14:48.692
You're so beautiful.

01:15:04.541 --> 01:15:05.709
I love you.

01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:14.676
Hey, it's OK. It's OK.
Evelyn. Evelyn, I'm back.

01:15:15.928 --> 01:15:19.515
It's OK. I won't leave 
you again, I promise.

01:15:20.516 --> 01:15:22.976
Rafe, you died.

01:15:25.145 --> 01:15:27.564
And so did I.

01:15:27.648 --> 01:15:30.943
I know, but I'm ...
It's fine now. I'm back.

01:15:31.944 --> 01:15:33.946
We're together.

01:15:40.077 --> 01:15:42.788
I mean, we are together,

01:15:42.871 --> 01:15:44.831
right?

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:48.627
I don't know where I am.

01:15:52.756 --> 01:15:53.840
Rafe.

01:16:22.703 --> 01:16:23.745
Rafe.

01:16:27.624 --> 01:16:29.626
Stay away.

01:16:33.046 --> 01:16:35.048
Rafe.

01:16:36.258 --> 01:16:39.678
This is Radio Honolulu,
playing the sweetest music ...

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:42.598
on the sweetest island 
in the Pacific.

01:16:42.681 --> 01:16:46.727
It's a beautiful December 6th,
with beautiful music ...

01:16:58.363 --> 01:16:59.781
Rafe.

01:16:59.865 --> 01:17:01.950
Goddammit. There you go.

01:17:02.034 --> 01:17:04.161
A real live ace.

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:08.081
An ace is only five. 
I shot down six MEs.

01:17:08.165 --> 01:17:10.792
And I got two smokers, too.
They don't count them.

01:17:10.876 --> 01:17:13.295
Of course, I got shot down
before they could pin me.

01:17:13.378 --> 01:17:15.297
You got back
from behind enemy lines, huh?

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:17.633
- What's that combat like?
- Were you scared?

01:17:17.716 --> 01:17:20.510
Hey! One at a time.

01:17:20.594 --> 01:17:23.013
Well, them Luftwaffe boys
can fly pretty good.

01:17:23.096 --> 01:17:25.932
It's not like, you know, training.
They're ...

01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:33.315
- Danny.
- They're all about tactics is what it is.

01:17:33.398 --> 01:17:37.194
See, the Nazis, they're faster than you are,
so they disappear and get up in the soup ...

01:17:37.277 --> 01:17:40.989
and throw like a roll or a hammerhead
and come around on your high side,

01:17:41.073 --> 01:17:44.910
shoot you from behind,
like some Americans will.

01:17:51.124 --> 01:17:57.047
- Gooz, you're lookin' at a real live ace.
- Let me give you the shirt off my back.

01:17:57.756 --> 01:18:00.717
- Aloha. There you go.
- I'll take it from you.

01:18:00.801 --> 01:18:02.761
I can see how y'all
been spending your time.

01:18:02.844 --> 01:18:06.556
- Rafe, we gotta talk, all right?
- I got nothin' to talk about with you.

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.308
Here.

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:11.436
Why don't you have a drink?

01:18:11.978 --> 01:18:14.481
I'll make a toast.

01:18:14.564 --> 01:18:19.820
To returning from the dead. Wasn't all 
I expected, but, well, that's life.

01:18:20.821 --> 01:18:23.198
To my best friend 
and loyal buddy Danny ...

01:18:23.281 --> 01:18:26.910
for keepin' up the war effort
back here at home.

01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:36.002
Where I come from, somebody makes a 
toast to you and you don't drink,

01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:38.547
that's sayin' something.

01:18:38.630 --> 01:18:43.802
All right, Rafe.
That's how it's gonna be. To you.

01:18:43.885 --> 01:18:47.973
- You guys need to spend some time alone.
- Hell, no, Red. Come on.

01:18:48.056 --> 01:18:50.642
No, no, no.
We're celebratin' here.

01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:52.728
Me over there fightin',

01:18:52.811 --> 01:18:54.813
almost gettin' killed,

01:18:54.896 --> 01:18:58.900
my friend Danny back here
lookin' after my interests for me.

01:18:58.984 --> 01:19:02.654
Danny was even good enough to look out
for my girl for me while I was gone.

01:19:02.738 --> 01:19:06.074
We thought you were dead, Rafe.
And it gutted us both.

01:19:06.158 --> 01:19:09.828
- We were tryin' to get on with our lives.
- Life is good, ain't it, Danny?

01:19:09.911 --> 01:19:12.080
You're a rotten drunk.
You always have been.

01:19:12.164 --> 01:19:16.168
Well, you're a lousy friend.
That's a new development.

01:19:17.335 --> 01:19:19.588
You left her to fight
somebody else's war ...

01:19:19.671 --> 01:19:22.924
and made damn sure I didn't go with 
you, and we thought you were dead.

01:19:23.008 --> 01:19:25.093
I almost did die,
you little son of a bitch.

01:19:25.177 --> 01:19:27.554
Her face was the last thing
that went through my mind,

01:19:27.637 --> 01:19:32.309
- so don't tell me to act like it's all right.
- Yeah, Rafe. Well, I stayed.

01:19:32.392 --> 01:19:35.145
I stayed, and you made sure of 
that, and some things changed.

01:19:35.228 --> 01:19:39.816
- And I hope you can get used to that.
- I have to get used to it?

01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:42.569
All right. We'll see
how I can get used to it.

01:19:44.488 --> 01:19:46.615
Get used to that, boy.

01:19:47.449 --> 01:19:49.701
And that's my left hand, too.

01:19:56.208 --> 01:19:58.168
Melee at the Hula-la. Send MPs.

01:20:01.671 --> 01:20:04.633
You calling me a lousy friend?

01:20:07.844 --> 01:20:09.429
Shit.

01:20:10.555 --> 01:20:12.724
Come on, Danny.

01:20:18.021 --> 01:20:20.023
Go get 'em.

01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:26.947
They're gonna throw us in 
the brig. Let's get outta here.

01:21:12.826 --> 01:21:14.828
Shit.

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:20.667
Rafe, you're the only family I got.

01:21:21.751 --> 01:21:25.338
When you were gone, it was 
the loneliest I'd ever been.

01:21:25.422 --> 01:21:27.465
The same for her, too.

01:21:27.549 --> 01:21:30.010
Boy, now you're really
breakin' my heart.

01:21:30.093 --> 01:21:32.262
If you hadn't gone,
none of this would have happened.

01:21:32.345 --> 01:21:35.682
So it's my fault, I guess.

01:21:35.765 --> 01:21:37.976
Dammit, Rafe.

01:21:41.354 --> 01:21:45.650
I just know there's got to be 
some way we can work things out ...

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:49.905
so that things can be right
between me and you.

01:21:50.947 --> 01:21:54.284
I just don't see how
it could ever be the same.

01:22:02.167 --> 01:22:03.501
Revered father,

01:22:07.631 --> 01:22:10.884
I go now to fulfil my mission
and my destiny.

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:13.970
I hope it is a destiny ...

01:22:14.054 --> 01:22:16.306
that will bring honour
to our family,

01:22:16.389 --> 01:22:18.808
and if it requires my life,

01:22:18.892 --> 01:22:23.063
I will sacrifice it gladly
to be a good servant of our nation.

01:23:46.438 --> 01:23:49.399
We got a large haze.

01:23:50.734 --> 01:23:52.694
That's too big to be planes, right?

01:23:57.157 --> 01:23:59.409
Is that what you wanna do?
Knight to knight five?

01:23:59.492 --> 01:24:01.077
Boom. Wrong move.

01:24:01.161 --> 01:24:04.789
Lieutenant, radar's picking up a large 
return moving in from the northeast.

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:06.916
Hang on.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:11.087
Relax. It's a flight of B-17s
coming in from the mainland.

01:24:12.964 --> 01:24:16.384
- Nothing to worry about.
- A heck of a lot of B-17s.

01:24:18.678 --> 01:24:21.681
Good shot, Hop.

01:24:23.349 --> 01:24:25.518
This better be good, Commander.

01:24:27.020 --> 01:24:29.189
One of our destroyers reports
having fired and sunk ...

01:24:29.272 --> 01:24:33.276
enemy submarine attempting
to enter Pearl Harbor at 06:53.

01:24:33.359 --> 01:24:34.444
It's 7:20.

01:24:34.527 --> 01:24:37.697
- We had decoder delays.
- Relay this to Washington. Recall the staff.

01:24:41.743 --> 01:24:43.453
"Failure ...

01:24:43.536 --> 01:24:45.121
peace talks ...

01:24:45.205 --> 01:24:46.748
useless."

01:24:49.334 --> 01:24:52.796
Thurman here. Tokyo transmitting
to their embassy in Washington:

01:24:52.879 --> 01:24:56.382
"Discontinue use of your decoding
machine, and dispose of immediately."

01:24:56.466 --> 01:25:00.053
"Special emphasis on destroying important
parts." Do you read that? Acknowledge.

01:25:07.936 --> 01:25:11.940
Naval intel intercepted a transmission
to the Japanese embassy in Washington ...

01:25:12.023 --> 01:25:14.651
instructing them to break apart
all decoder machines ...

01:25:14.734 --> 01:25:16.778
and burn all secret documents.

01:25:16.861 --> 01:25:19.739
The Japanese are expecting a war.

01:25:20.740 --> 01:25:21.825
Should we?

01:26:08.454 --> 01:26:12.500
Warning of possible Japanese
aggressive movement in any direction.

01:26:12.584 --> 01:26:16.963
"Broken relationship.
Hostilities imminent." But where?

01:26:55.793 --> 01:26:58.296
Did you ever lose a fight, Miller?

01:26:59.756 --> 01:27:04.093
- I been lucky so far, Captain.
- From what I hear, it ain't luck.

01:27:05.094 --> 01:27:07.430
Ship's proud of you, son.

01:27:41.881 --> 01:27:46.594
Why the hell's the navy doing 
practice this early on a Sunday?

01:28:49.699 --> 01:28:50.700
Go, go, go, go.

01:28:52.410 --> 01:28:57.623
I'm with Navy Newsreel, and I can tell you
one thing ― them ain't navy planes.

01:29:00.543 --> 01:29:04.797
- All hands, man your battle stations.
- We're being bombed. Get up. Get up.

01:29:17.393 --> 01:29:19.228
Jesus Christ.

01:29:28.529 --> 01:29:31.657
- Man your battle stations.
- Another dumb drill.

01:29:48.341 --> 01:29:50.885
- Man your battle stations.
- What the heck was that?

01:29:50.968 --> 01:29:53.096
It's a bomb.

01:30:01.145 --> 01:30:02.021
Son of a bi ...

01:30:10.196 --> 01:30:12.365
Get me the engine room.

01:30:15.034 --> 01:30:16.202
My God.

01:30:16.285 --> 01:30:18.454
Take cover.

01:30:21.082 --> 01:30:24.252
Report battle stations
manned and ready.

01:30:24.335 --> 01:30:25.795
Man your battle stations.

01:30:25.878 --> 01:30:28.756
This is no shit.
They just sunk the Arizona.

01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:32.552
General quarters. General quarters.
All hands, man your battle stations.

01:30:32.635 --> 01:30:34.095
This is no damn drill.

01:30:40.518 --> 01:30:42.061
They look like Japs.

01:30:42.145 --> 01:30:44.730
I didn't even know
the Japs were sore at us.

01:30:44.814 --> 01:30:48.776
Danny, you just get me
into a goddamn airplane.

01:30:50.236 --> 01:30:53.823
- Holy God.
- This is good footage. Did you see that?

01:30:53.906 --> 01:30:57.160
- Holy cow.
- I hope there's still an airfield left.

01:31:36.616 --> 01:31:39.118
Hurry up. What in the world?

01:31:41.412 --> 01:31:43.581
Look. So many.

01:31:52.965 --> 01:31:54.967
Everybody to the hospital.

01:32:07.438 --> 01:32:10.650
Why's the navy always buzzin' us?

01:32:10.858 --> 01:32:12.818
Shut up, Red.

01:32:15.488 --> 01:32:17.406
- Come on.
- Red, it's too early.

01:32:17.490 --> 01:32:19.325
The Japs are here.

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:23.329
What the hell? 
Let's go. Let's go.

01:32:59.365 --> 01:33:01.284
- Get corpsmen to the bridge.
- Aye, Captain.

01:33:09.166 --> 01:33:11.961
Repair says third deck
is flooding port side.

01:33:32.315 --> 01:33:35.651
Get up, you cowards.
Get up there and fight. Move it.

01:33:48.956 --> 01:33:51.751
- I got you, Captain.
- You radio for air cover.

01:33:51.834 --> 01:33:54.378
Initiate damage control.

01:33:54.462 --> 01:33:58.674
Find my XO. Tell him to assume command.
And you make sure the gunners ...

01:33:58.758 --> 01:34:03.929
Everyone's where they need to be,
Captain. You trained us well.

01:34:04.013 --> 01:34:06.891
You trained us well.

01:34:06.974 --> 01:34:08.392
Captain.

01:34:41.175 --> 01:34:43.219
Go, go, go, go.

01:34:43.302 --> 01:34:45.680
Let's go. Let's go.
Everybody move.

01:34:49.141 --> 01:34:53.521
Get the ammo for that fifty-cal.
Get that fifty-cal.

01:35:04.532 --> 01:35:08.369
Come on, man, we gotta get 
this thing loaded up.

01:35:22.883 --> 01:35:24.719
Let's go. Let's go.

01:35:27.221 --> 01:35:29.223
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

01:35:52.246 --> 01:35:53.330
Come on.

01:36:03.132 --> 01:36:07.136
- Danny, get me into a damn plane.
- Come on.

01:36:17.188 --> 01:36:20.816
Get some ammo up here.
We need some men on these guns.

01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:25.780
- The captain says you're in charge, sir.
- We need more ammo. Now.

01:36:25.863 --> 01:36:28.783
Send up ammunition 
for the five-inch guns.

01:36:31.202 --> 01:36:33.871
- Medic.
- All of 'em, now.

01:37:00.898 --> 01:37:02.525
Come on.

01:37:04.151 --> 01:37:05.319
Come on.

01:37:05.569 --> 01:37:07.947
Come on, you son of a bitch.

01:37:17.623 --> 01:37:20.125
I need a doctor.
Somebody help me.

01:37:20.209 --> 01:37:23.170
Take a deep breath.
Come on, breathe.

01:37:23.921 --> 01:37:26.507
Get to the supply room.

01:37:27.049 --> 01:37:29.718
Get everything out.

01:37:36.392 --> 01:37:37.560
Plane incoming.

01:37:41.105 --> 01:37:43.023
Cut 'em down.

01:37:43.524 --> 01:37:46.861
Come on, come on.
Get 'em away from the windows.

01:38:08.883 --> 01:38:12.887
- Everybody all right?
- Can you stand? Can you stand?

01:38:14.555 --> 01:38:17.474
- Hold your fire.
- Get to the gun. Hurry up.

01:38:19.476 --> 01:38:21.478
Get down, Danny.

01:38:30.988 --> 01:38:32.281
- Earl.
- This is Walker.

01:38:32.364 --> 01:38:34.658
We need those planes
fuelled and loaded right now.

01:38:34.742 --> 01:38:36.785
What's going on out there?

01:38:36.869 --> 01:38:39.955
What the hell's that noise?
You guys doin' target practice?

01:38:40.039 --> 01:38:41.749
I think World War II just hit us.

01:38:50.215 --> 01:38:52.718
Go, go, go.

01:39:00.059 --> 01:39:01.810
- Billy.
- Run.

01:39:01.936 --> 01:39:05.147
- It's gonna blow.
- It's a dud.

01:39:05.773 --> 01:39:07.149
It's a dud.

01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:18.035
Get down.

01:39:18.827 --> 01:39:22.122
- Danny. Danny, are you all right?
- I'm all right. Come on, let's go.

01:39:22.206 --> 01:39:25.751
Come on, let's go.
Gooz, come on, man.

01:39:50.985 --> 01:39:53.612
We're sinking. We're sinking.

01:40:00.536 --> 01:40:03.789
Stay together.
Close the hatches.

01:40:17.886 --> 01:40:20.097
- I can't swim.
- Just hang on.

01:40:33.068 --> 01:40:35.320
Let's move it. Now.

01:40:35.404 --> 01:40:37.197
Joe. Go. Go.

01:40:37.281 --> 01:40:39.366
We're gettin' outta here.
Get in the car.

01:40:39.450 --> 01:40:40.743
Get in. Get in.

01:40:40.826 --> 01:40:42.119
Come on, let's go. Go.

01:40:42.202 --> 01:40:44.830
Get out of the way.
Get out of the way.

01:40:46.915 --> 01:40:48.167
Where are we goin'?

01:40:48.250 --> 01:40:52.546
We got a small mechanic runway about
ten minutes away. Hasn't been hit yet.

01:40:58.052 --> 01:40:59.803
We got Zeros on our six.

01:41:05.559 --> 01:41:07.352
Duck.

01:42:01.281 --> 01:42:03.700
We're trapped.

01:42:04.576 --> 01:42:06.703
Try it. Try the door.

01:42:41.572 --> 01:42:43.824
It's sucking me back.

01:42:43.907 --> 01:42:46.660
The current's too strong.

01:42:59.214 --> 01:43:01.341
They're still shootin' at us.

01:43:09.558 --> 01:43:11.768
I don't wanna die. 
I don't wanna die.

01:43:42.216 --> 01:43:44.301
This is it.

01:44:09.159 --> 01:44:10.953
How bad?

01:44:11.036 --> 01:44:13.372
It's still not over, sir.

01:44:17.376 --> 01:44:21.421
An entire fleet at anchor.

01:44:21.505 --> 01:44:24.549
My God, my God.

01:44:47.239 --> 01:44:51.576
Barbara, fill every syringe
you can find with morphine.

01:44:53.328 --> 01:44:55.706
Fill up the kitchen.
Are you listening to me?

01:44:55.789 --> 01:44:57.207
Fill up the kitchen.

01:45:05.048 --> 01:45:07.926
Over there. Over there.

01:45:14.599 --> 01:45:18.520
- We got a bad neck wound here.
- Surgery. Move.

01:45:18.603 --> 01:45:21.148
Get him to surgery. God.

01:45:21.231 --> 01:45:22.899
In here.

01:45:22.983 --> 01:45:25.819
He's still bleeding.
Another haemostat.

01:45:25.902 --> 01:45:28.196
Haemostat. Give me a haemostat now.

01:45:31.033 --> 01:45:32.951
Dammit, hurry.

01:45:35.037 --> 01:45:38.832
Gimme another haemostat.
Another suture. Hurry.

01:45:39.875 --> 01:45:41.960
God, I'm so sorry.

01:45:47.507 --> 01:45:49.968
- Doctor.
- Here.

01:45:57.934 --> 01:46:00.520
Am I gonna die?

01:46:00.604 --> 01:46:02.189
Nurse.

01:46:07.527 --> 01:46:09.029
Don't leave me.

01:46:09.112 --> 01:46:11.615
Doctor. Get over here.

01:46:13.867 --> 01:46:18.080
My fingers are plugging his artery.
Doctor, what do you need?

01:46:19.623 --> 01:46:21.917
Focus, look at me.
What do you need?

01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.586
- Haemostat.
- Haemostat.

01:46:26.880 --> 01:46:30.300
Here. All right, look at me.
You're gonna be all right.

01:46:30.384 --> 01:46:32.260
You're gonna be all right.

01:46:41.061 --> 01:46:44.773
I need more ammo.
I need more ammo, ladies.

01:46:44.856 --> 01:46:47.109
I need more ammo.

01:46:47.192 --> 01:46:49.277
Earl. We good to go?

01:46:49.361 --> 01:46:51.071
- Mostly, but ...
- Get down.

01:46:51.154 --> 01:46:53.573
- Shit. Get cover.
- Jesus.

01:46:56.576 --> 01:46:59.079
- Come on, you guys.
- Earl, get in here.

01:47:01.748 --> 01:47:04.918
Hey, Sergeant. We're gonna 
need more than a shotgun.

01:47:05.001 --> 01:47:07.462
You got any other weapons 
and ammo for cover fire?

01:47:07.546 --> 01:47:09.131
Inside that ammo locker.

01:47:09.214 --> 01:47:11.550
- Come on.
- Let's go. Move it.

01:47:13.385 --> 01:47:15.971
- Go. Go.
- Get the guns out.

01:47:16.054 --> 01:47:19.307
You said the planes are mostly 
ready, but ... But what?

01:47:19.391 --> 01:47:21.977
She's down, she's broke, 
she's shit. I got four left.

01:47:22.060 --> 01:47:24.438
One's good to go,
two need ammo, one needs fuel.

01:47:24.521 --> 01:47:26.648
Fall out
and load up in the bunker.

01:47:26.731 --> 01:47:28.024
Let's go. Get down.

01:47:28.108 --> 01:47:30.944
- Move.
- Get ready to roll this thing.

01:47:31.027 --> 01:47:33.113
Get down. Now.

01:47:33.196 --> 01:47:37.659
All right. Anthony, Red, you stay 
here and man the fifty-calibre.

01:47:37.742 --> 01:47:41.955
Gooz, get up to the next bunker
and lay down some cover fire.

01:47:42.038 --> 01:47:43.123
Planes.

01:47:45.500 --> 01:47:47.752
Should we fire?

01:47:47.836 --> 01:47:51.381
Stay down. No, goddammit. Hold your 
fire. Stay still. Nobody fire.

01:47:51.465 --> 01:47:53.675
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God.

01:47:57.304 --> 01:47:58.930
They don't know we're here.

01:47:59.639 --> 01:48:01.057
- Stay down.
- Fire?

01:48:01.141 --> 01:48:05.395
No, no, no, goddammit.
Stay down, stay still. Don't fire.

01:48:09.816 --> 01:48:11.067
God.

01:48:20.035 --> 01:48:23.371
I don't see any ordnance.
I think they're going home.

01:48:23.455 --> 01:48:26.166
No. They'll be back. We still 
got planes on the ground.

01:48:26.249 --> 01:48:28.293
All right. You pilots, listen up.

01:48:28.376 --> 01:48:30.462
Get all the speed
you can on the runway,

01:48:30.545 --> 01:48:32.297
don't get on the stick
till the very end.

01:48:32.380 --> 01:48:34.966
In the air, stay low
between the buildings.

01:48:35.050 --> 01:48:37.719
You see any Zero on your tail,
try to wipe him off.

01:48:37.802 --> 01:48:40.347
Don't freeze, all right? 
Just keep moving.

01:48:40.430 --> 01:48:45.101
We're gonna try to separate 'em.
We can take 'em out one by one.

01:48:45.185 --> 01:48:49.397
P-40s can't outrun Zeros, so don't try.
We're gonna have to outfly 'em.

01:48:49.481 --> 01:48:52.651
We got high-level bombers.
They'll bust this hangar wide open.

01:48:52.734 --> 01:48:55.570
Grab the fifties. Let's move.

01:48:56.571 --> 01:48:58.490
Move. Move.

01:48:58.573 --> 01:49:01.034
Go, go, go.

01:49:03.787 --> 01:49:05.497
Zeros.

01:49:05.580 --> 01:49:07.749
Take cover. Take cover.

01:49:17.425 --> 01:49:20.136
Take cover. Take cover.

01:49:31.731 --> 01:49:34.317
- Get down. Get down.
- Let's go. In the box.

01:49:51.835 --> 01:49:52.836
Danny.

01:49:56.089 --> 01:49:57.674
Come on.

01:49:57.757 --> 01:49:58.925
Come on, buddy.

01:49:59.009 --> 01:50:01.636
Leave him, he's dead.
He's dead.

01:50:09.936 --> 01:50:13.898
They're kicking our butt. Get to
the airplanes. Let's go. Go, go, go.

01:50:15.775 --> 01:50:18.111
Run. Red, Anthony, let's go.

01:50:22.032 --> 01:50:25.368
Come on, help me.
Goddamn belts.

01:50:28.997 --> 01:50:30.665
Let's go. Come on.

01:50:38.381 --> 01:50:39.841
Knock 'em dead.

01:50:39.924 --> 01:50:43.219
Quick. Get in. 
Here, put this on.

01:50:44.054 --> 01:50:46.890
- They're coming around.
- Bring 'em out. Let's go.

01:50:53.772 --> 01:50:56.483
Red, get out of here, 
goddammit. Go.

01:50:59.027 --> 01:51:01.237
Come on, come on. Let's go.

01:51:01.321 --> 01:51:04.282
- Joe, get out the way.
- I'm rollin'. I'm rollin'.

01:51:06.743 --> 01:51:08.286
Clear. Go.

01:51:08.370 --> 01:51:10.538
God. Planes.

01:51:11.456 --> 01:51:12.707
Come on, help me.

01:51:15.585 --> 01:51:19.047
Hey, Joe. You got three Zeros right 
behind you. Three Zeros on your six.

01:51:28.848 --> 01:51:31.059
Turn. Turn.

01:51:32.394 --> 01:51:33.478
God.

01:51:45.281 --> 01:51:46.408
Shit.

01:51:46.491 --> 01:51:48.660
What are you doing?
Get going. Get moving.

01:51:48.743 --> 01:51:53.206
Start that thing up and get in the air. I'm
no good without a wing man. I need you.

01:51:53.289 --> 01:51:54.457
I got you.

01:51:56.876 --> 01:51:58.211
Let's do it.

01:52:16.271 --> 01:52:19.232
It's real tight, Rafe. 
It's real tight.

01:52:33.455 --> 01:52:35.665
Rafe, I'm not sure
we have enough runway.

01:52:35.749 --> 01:52:37.709
Get your airspeed up
before you leave the dirt.

01:52:37.792 --> 01:52:40.003
Don't freeze. Don't freeze.

01:52:44.215 --> 01:52:46.843
I don't think 
I'm gonna make it over.

01:52:46.926 --> 01:52:48.219
Come on. Come on.

01:52:57.771 --> 01:52:59.230
We did it. I'm up.

01:53:01.316 --> 01:53:03.151
We got Zeros behind us, Rafe.

01:53:05.028 --> 01:53:07.405
How many do you see back there?

01:53:10.909 --> 01:53:12.202
We got five on our six.

01:53:18.541 --> 01:53:20.585
Take it down to the deck, now.

01:53:29.052 --> 01:53:31.137
We gotta split 'em up.

01:53:31.763 --> 01:53:35.016
You take left, I'll take right.

01:53:38.853 --> 01:53:41.648
Earl, get some guns
in that goddamn tower.

01:53:41.731 --> 01:53:45.068
OK. Let's go. 
Into the truck. Let's go.

01:53:50.907 --> 01:53:52.575
Danny, I got three on my six.

01:54:13.930 --> 01:54:16.808
Stop. Stop. Let's go.

01:54:16.891 --> 01:54:18.351
Let's go. Move it.
Move it, Red.

01:54:19.936 --> 01:54:22.397
- Let's go.
- Gimme the fifty.

01:54:23.398 --> 01:54:26.025
Let's go. All right.

01:54:29.737 --> 01:54:32.198
I've still got 
two behind me, Rafe.

01:54:45.587 --> 01:54:47.589
Son of a bitch.

01:54:56.264 --> 01:54:59.225
Earl, do you hear me?
Get some guns in that tower.

01:54:59.309 --> 01:55:02.854
On the tower. Going ten storeys up.
It's a long son of a bitch.

01:55:11.905 --> 01:55:15.158
They're all over me.
I can't get them off me.

01:55:22.248 --> 01:55:24.918
I've still got three on my tail.

01:55:27.795 --> 01:55:30.882
- Don't let them get a handle on you.
- I can't shake 'em.

01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:34.093
Goddammit.

01:55:35.053 --> 01:55:37.597
Danny, let's play chicken
with these Jap suckers.

01:55:37.680 --> 01:55:39.974
All right, I'm with you.

01:55:41.059 --> 01:55:42.143
Jesus.

01:55:46.356 --> 01:55:49.192
- I'm coming right at you.
- Don't brake till I tell you.

01:55:51.027 --> 01:55:52.111
Not yet.

01:55:53.196 --> 01:55:54.906
Come on. Come on.

01:55:55.990 --> 01:55:57.200
Go left. Now.

01:56:02.497 --> 01:56:04.666
We got 'em.

01:56:04.749 --> 01:56:07.210
Set up over there.

01:56:08.795 --> 01:56:11.589
- Come on, load it.
- We're on the tower.

01:56:13.883 --> 01:56:16.594
I got one on my tail.
I'll bring him right by you.

01:56:16.678 --> 01:56:20.431
He's comin' around.
Let's get this Jap sucker.

01:56:23.726 --> 01:56:25.895
Hold your fire. Here he comes.

01:56:27.230 --> 01:56:29.524
You better be cocked and locked
when I come by.

01:56:31.859 --> 01:56:33.736
Hold your fire.

01:56:34.904 --> 01:56:36.197
Fire.

01:56:44.580 --> 01:56:45.748
Good shootin', boys.

01:56:45.832 --> 01:56:48.960
Nice shot, Earl.
Let's head over to Battleship Row.

01:56:49.043 --> 01:56:50.211
I'm with you.

01:56:58.886 --> 01:57:00.722
Let's go do some business.

01:57:02.765 --> 01:57:03.850
I'm going after 'em.

01:57:15.278 --> 01:57:17.071
I got him.

01:57:18.573 --> 01:57:20.825
P-40s.

01:57:23.036 --> 01:57:27.582
They're pulling into the clouds. We ain't
gonna let these sons of bitches get home.

01:57:33.755 --> 01:57:35.757
How do you like someone
shooting back at you?

01:57:46.267 --> 01:57:48.936
I'm on your ass now.

01:57:52.774 --> 01:57:54.400
I got one.

01:57:56.069 --> 01:57:58.112
Come on.

01:58:09.582 --> 01:58:10.708
God, come on.

01:58:19.425 --> 01:58:20.843
Come on, stay in there.

01:58:33.815 --> 01:58:35.858
I got you, you son of a bitch.

01:59:23.322 --> 01:59:26.534
Who taught you how to fly,
Lieutenant?

01:59:28.161 --> 01:59:30.163
He did.

01:59:35.293 --> 01:59:38.171
I have to amputate here.
I have to amputate.

01:59:38.254 --> 01:59:41.340
- You're not gonna die.
- I got you. Hold onto this ...

01:59:41.424 --> 01:59:45.469
Sandra, we're running out of morphine.
Find some way to mark 'em,

01:59:45.553 --> 01:59:48.848
so we can keep track
of who's got the morphine already.

01:59:48.931 --> 01:59:51.184
Tell me about your ship.
What ship are you from?

01:59:51.267 --> 01:59:54.061
It's not marking.
Ev, you got a marker?

01:59:58.065 --> 02:00:00.693
Use my lipstick.
Put "M" for morphine.

02:00:00.776 --> 02:00:04.280
- Evelyn, we need a tourniquet.
- Tourniquet.

02:00:05.573 --> 02:00:07.450
Where are the clamps?

02:00:12.830 --> 02:00:14.999
There's nothing left.

02:00:16.626 --> 02:00:18.669
- Evelyn.
- Here, use this.

02:00:18.753 --> 02:00:22.298
Go outside. There's too many 
to help. You gotta sort them out.

02:00:22.381 --> 02:00:24.926
Only those that can be saved
you bring in. You got that?

02:00:25.009 --> 02:00:28.054
- I can't.
- No, please, I need you to do it.

02:00:28.137 --> 02:00:29.555
Go. Go.

02:00:56.999 --> 02:00:59.877
Don't look at anyone without a mark.

02:00:59.961 --> 02:01:03.297
- I told you, stand back.
- Keep 'em outside.

02:01:03.381 --> 02:01:05.758
Come on. Let's go.

02:01:08.010 --> 02:01:09.387
Wait here.

02:01:09.470 --> 02:01:12.431
Don't touch me, you Jap.
Get your hands off me.

02:01:12.515 --> 02:01:14.350
Get him into critical.

02:01:14.433 --> 02:01:17.770
- Get him off me.
- Critical, front ward.

02:01:19.605 --> 02:01:23.651
- How bad am I?
- You're gonna be just fine, sweetheart.

02:01:23.734 --> 02:01:28.030
- I don't wanna die.
- You're not gonna die. I've got your hand.

02:01:28.114 --> 02:01:31.158
Do you have enough morphine to make
him comfortable? He won't make it.

02:01:31.242 --> 02:01:34.287
- Line the critical up.
- Get him morphine. Take him over there.

02:01:34.370 --> 02:01:36.122
Burn victims by the tree.

02:01:36.205 --> 02:01:40.293
I just found her.
I don't think she's breathing.

02:01:40.376 --> 02:01:43.045
No, she's dead. Take her ...

02:01:45.756 --> 02:01:47.425
God.

02:01:48.968 --> 02:01:52.138
Are you sure, Ev?
Could you check her one more time?

02:01:52.221 --> 02:01:56.475
- She's dead. Take her over there.
- But you've gotta be sure.

02:01:56.559 --> 02:01:59.061
Go back to work, Sandra.

02:02:00.354 --> 02:02:02.773
I don't know what to do.

02:03:34.573 --> 02:03:36.158
Over here.

02:03:36.242 --> 02:03:37.993
Admiral?

02:03:38.077 --> 02:03:40.663
From Washington.

02:03:40.746 --> 02:03:43.374
"Attack by Japan 
considered imminent."

02:03:48.045 --> 02:03:50.339
They're only an hour late.

02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:52.067
- How can we help?
- We need blood. Come on.

02:04:54.904 --> 02:04:59.450
Remember, son, hold on to your 
faith. Remember what Jesus said:

02:04:59.533 --> 02:05:03.120
"Today you will be with me 
in paradise, so fear not."

02:05:03.204 --> 02:05:05.247
Fear not, my son.

02:05:05.331 --> 02:05:07.833
You are a man truly blessed.

02:05:07.917 --> 02:05:10.628
You will die in a state of grace.

02:05:10.711 --> 02:05:14.632
Remember, pain is temporary,
but glory is forever.

02:05:14.715 --> 02:05:16.717
Hold on to your faith, my son.

02:05:16.800 --> 02:05:20.095
You'll be with God, all the saints,
and all the angels very soon.

02:05:20.179 --> 02:05:21.722
I absolve you of your sins ...

02:05:21.805 --> 02:05:25.893
in the name of the Father,
the Son, the Holy Spirit.

02:05:28.395 --> 02:05:30.022
Amen.

02:05:36.695 --> 02:05:38.697
Go with God, my son.

02:05:45.329 --> 02:05:47.498
We've got men trapped
everywhere in the harbour.

02:05:47.581 --> 02:05:49.375
We need help
from anybody who can move.

02:05:57.550 --> 02:06:01.220
There's somebody in here.
Get somebody down here.

02:06:03.389 --> 02:06:05.933
They're cutting through.

02:06:10.354 --> 02:06:13.482
I hear somebody.
Get some guys up here.

02:06:13.566 --> 02:06:15.568
Pull.

02:06:18.362 --> 02:06:21.365
Get us out of here.
It's filling up with water.

02:06:21.448 --> 02:06:24.243
Get an airline in here.

02:06:25.869 --> 02:06:28.789
We need an air hose.
What can we do?

02:06:33.252 --> 02:06:35.754
It won't cut any faster.

02:06:38.465 --> 02:06:40.843
Cut him out.

02:07:14.084 --> 02:07:15.502
Yesterday,

02:07:15.586 --> 02:07:19.965
December 7, 1941,

02:07:21.175 --> 02:07:24.428
a date which will live in infamy,

02:07:24.511 --> 02:07:27.348
the United States of America ...

02:07:27.431 --> 02:07:30.643
was suddenly
and deliberately attacked ...

02:07:30.726 --> 02:07:35.230
by naval and air forces
of the empire of Japan.

02:07:37.566 --> 02:07:43.489
It is obvious that planning the 
attack began many weeks ago.

02:07:43.572 --> 02:07:46.325
During the intervening time,

02:07:46.408 --> 02:07:48.202
the Japanese government ...

02:07:48.285 --> 02:07:51.997
has deliberately sought
to deceive the United States ...

02:07:52.081 --> 02:07:58.921
by false statements and expressions 
of hope for continued peace.

02:07:59.004 --> 02:08:03.967
The attack yesterday
on the Hawaiian islands ...

02:08:04.051 --> 02:08:09.139
has caused severe damage
to American military forces.

02:08:09.223 --> 02:08:16.146
I regret to tell you that over 3,000
American lives have been lost.

02:08:16.230 --> 02:08:19.233
No matter how long
it may take us ...

02:08:19.316 --> 02:08:22.986
to overcome
this premeditated invasion,

02:08:23.070 --> 02:08:27.282
the American people,
in their righteous might,

02:08:27.366 --> 02:08:29.910
will win through 
to absolute victory.

02:08:34.081 --> 02:08:40.087
Because of this unprovoked,
dastardly attack by Japan,

02:08:40.170 --> 02:08:44.091
I ask that the Congress
declare a state of war.

02:08:49.722 --> 02:08:55.227
Is it true men are still trapped 
alive inside the Arizona?

02:08:57.146 --> 02:08:59.189
We can hear tapping
from inside the hull.

02:08:59.273 --> 02:09:04.486
We're doing all we can to get to them,
but they're 40 feet below water.

02:09:09.324 --> 02:09:12.661
We've been trained to think
that we're invincible.

02:09:12.745 --> 02:09:15.873
And now our proudest ships
have been destroyed ...

02:09:15.956 --> 02:09:19.918
by an enemy we considered inferior.

02:09:20.002 --> 02:09:22.171
We're on the ropes, gentlemen.

02:09:22.254 --> 02:09:26.175
That's exactly why
we have to strike back now.

02:09:26.258 --> 02:09:29.052
We'll attack the Marshall
and Gilbert Islands, sir.

02:09:29.136 --> 02:09:34.641
I'm talking about hitting the heart
of Japan the way they have hit us.

02:09:34.725 --> 02:09:36.810
Mr. President,

02:09:36.894 --> 02:09:40.272
Pearl Harbor caught us unawares
because we didn't face facts.

02:09:40.355 --> 02:09:43.317
This isn't a time
for ignoring them again.

02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:46.820
We have long-range bombers,
but no place to launch them.

02:09:46.904 --> 02:09:52.159
Midway is too far, and Russia won't 
allow us to launch a raid from there.

02:09:53.368 --> 02:09:54.495
Admiral?

02:09:54.578 --> 02:09:57.873
Navy's planes are small. They carry
light loads and have a short range.

02:09:57.956 --> 02:10:00.959
We'd have to get them
within a few hundred miles of Japan,

02:10:01.043 --> 02:10:04.379
and therefore risk our carriers.
And if we lose them,

02:10:04.463 --> 02:10:06.131
we have no shield against invasion.

02:10:06.215 --> 02:10:10.844
Does anyone in this room think victory 
is possible without facing danger?

02:10:10.928 --> 02:10:13.931
We are at war.
Of course there's a risk.

02:10:14.014 --> 02:10:18.685
But consider the risk, Mr. President.
If the Japanese invade us right now,

02:10:18.769 --> 02:10:23.398
they would penetrate as far as 
Chicago before we could stop them.

02:10:24.399 --> 02:10:26.401
Gentlemen.

02:10:28.237 --> 02:10:32.991
Most of you did not know me
when I had the use of my legs.

02:10:33.075 --> 02:10:36.829
I was strong and proud and arrogant.

02:10:37.621 --> 02:10:44.253
Now I wonder, every hour of my life,
why God put me into this chair.

02:10:44.336 --> 02:10:47.965
But when I see defeat
in the eyes of my countrymen ―

02:10:48.048 --> 02:10:50.384
in your eyes, right now ―

02:10:50.467 --> 02:10:54.680
I start to think that maybe he brought 
me down for times like these,

02:10:54.763 --> 02:10:57.516
when we all need to be reminded
who we truly are ―

02:10:57.599 --> 02:11:00.352
that we will not give up or give in.

02:11:00.435 --> 02:11:05.440
Mr. President, with all respect, sir,
what you're asking can't be done.

02:11:20.581 --> 02:11:22.791
- Mr. President.
- Get back, George.

02:11:22.875 --> 02:11:24.167
Get back.

02:11:36.430 --> 02:11:38.974
Do not tell me ...

02:11:39.057 --> 02:11:41.143
it can't be done.

02:11:45.814 --> 02:11:51.278
Japan continues its military
conquest throughout the Pacific.

02:11:51.361 --> 02:11:55.657
But, back home, millions of 
American workers band together ...

02:11:55.741 --> 02:11:58.619
bringing factories to life
to avenge Pearl Harbor.

02:12:03.123 --> 02:12:06.835
Mr. President, we have an idea
how to bomb the Japanese.

02:12:06.919 --> 02:12:10.213
Sir, it's risky, but it's bold.

02:12:11.924 --> 02:12:14.384
- Who are you?
- I, sir?

02:12:14.468 --> 02:12:17.387
Captain Low, Mr. President.

02:12:17.471 --> 02:12:19.681
He's a submariner.
He came up with this idea.

02:12:19.765 --> 02:12:22.142
I like sub commanders.

02:12:22.225 --> 02:12:26.021
They don't have time
for bullshit, and neither do I.

02:12:26.104 --> 02:12:28.023
Fire away, gentlemen.

02:12:44.289 --> 02:12:48.210
And where is God in all this?

02:12:48.293 --> 02:12:53.048
Our enemies believe that a 
divine wind protects them.

02:12:53.131 --> 02:12:56.927
But we see our friends
laid out here before us.

02:13:18.907 --> 02:13:20.909
Hey, Captain.

02:13:43.640 --> 02:13:45.684
Lieutenants Rafe McCawley,
Daniel Walker.

02:13:45.767 --> 02:13:46.810
Yes, Major?

02:13:47.686 --> 02:13:50.272
You're both going stateside.
Fly out in two hours.

02:13:50.355 --> 02:13:53.316
- What for, sir?
- Ask Colonel Doolittle.

02:13:56.945 --> 02:13:58.363
Yes, sir.

02:14:14.087 --> 02:14:16.381
You're packing.

02:14:18.633 --> 02:14:20.802
Orders.

02:14:20.886 --> 02:14:23.055
What kind of orders?

02:14:23.889 --> 02:14:26.266
The top-secret kind.

02:14:26.349 --> 02:14:29.186
The dangerous kind.

02:14:30.353 --> 02:14:34.316
- I can't find Danny.
- Is that why you're here?

02:14:34.399 --> 02:14:37.110
Looking for Danny?

02:14:37.194 --> 02:14:41.531
Probably saying goodbye to his squadron.
We've been assigned to Doolittle.

02:14:49.164 --> 02:14:51.500
I wasn't looking for Danny.

02:14:56.379 --> 02:15:00.717
I couldn't have you go away
without you understanding something.

02:15:05.305 --> 02:15:08.016
Yeah. Well, you don't have
to explain anything to me.

02:15:08.100 --> 02:15:12.020
I do, because you're acting
like I didn't love you.

02:15:12.104 --> 02:15:15.357
Evelyn, loving you kept me alive.

02:15:26.284 --> 02:15:28.703
I should've died over there.

02:15:28.787 --> 02:15:32.457
When I was in that water,
I made a deal with God.

02:15:34.084 --> 02:15:38.630
I told him I was sorry, that I knew 
I'd been a fool for leaving you,

02:15:38.713 --> 02:15:42.134
trying to go over there
and be a hero,

02:15:42.217 --> 02:15:45.470
and I promised I'd never ask
for anything again ...

02:15:45.554 --> 02:15:48.431
if I could just see you
one more time.

02:15:51.935 --> 02:15:54.271
And you know what?

02:15:55.313 --> 02:15:57.607
It was worth it.

02:15:58.567 --> 02:16:01.945
You kept me alive, Evelyn.
You brought me home.

02:16:03.155 --> 02:16:07.242
So I'm gonna stand by my end of 
the deal. I'm gonna walk away.

02:16:07.325 --> 02:16:10.579
And I won't ask you for anything.

02:16:10.662 --> 02:16:12.414
But I just want to know why.

02:16:12.497 --> 02:16:16.960
Just tell me that, will you, 
please? Just tell me why.

02:16:17.043 --> 02:16:19.212
Rafe, I'm pregnant.

02:16:28.305 --> 02:16:30.056
My God.

02:16:33.351 --> 02:16:37.272
I didn't even know until the 
day you turned up alive.

02:16:38.272 --> 02:16:40.734
And then all this happened.

02:16:42.527 --> 02:16:45.322
I haven't told Danny.

02:16:45.405 --> 02:16:47.490
I don't want him to know.

02:16:47.574 --> 02:16:52.745
All he needs to think about is how
to do this mission and get back alive.

02:16:55.123 --> 02:16:57.125
Rafe.

02:16:57.209 --> 02:17:01.671
All I ever wanted was for us
to have a home, grow old together,

02:17:01.754 --> 02:17:04.674
but life never asked me
what I wanted.

02:17:04.758 --> 02:17:08.093
Now, I'm gonna give Danny
my whole heart,

02:17:09.930 --> 02:17:15.602
but I don't think I'll ever look at
another sunset without thinking of you.

02:17:18.146 --> 02:17:20.482
I'll love you my whole life.

02:17:57.769 --> 02:17:59.938
I'll see you on board.

02:18:17.205 --> 02:18:21.293
You know, the only thing
that scares me ...

02:18:21.376 --> 02:18:25.088
is that you might love him
more than you love me.

02:18:26.715 --> 02:18:30.050
I love you, Danny.

02:18:31.386 --> 02:18:35.223
And I'll be here waiting
for you when you come back.

02:18:52.240 --> 02:18:54.450
Follow me.

02:18:57.162 --> 02:18:58.705
Colonel.

02:19:02.791 --> 02:19:06.754
- Congratulations on your promotion, sir.
- I heard what you did.

02:19:06.838 --> 02:19:09.924
- We can explain that, sir.
- Explain what?

02:19:10.008 --> 02:19:12.177
Whatever it is you 
heard about us, sir.

02:19:12.260 --> 02:19:15.638
You mean the hula shirts
you were flying in?

02:19:19.893 --> 02:19:23.188
Or the seven planes
you shot down?

02:19:25.315 --> 02:19:30.779
You're both being awarded the 
Silver Star, and promoted to captain.

02:19:32.280 --> 02:19:34.240
Is that the good news, sir, or ...?

02:19:34.324 --> 02:19:38.827
You're just about the only pilots 
in the army with combat experience.

02:19:38.912 --> 02:19:42.707
I need you for a mission
I've been ordered to put together.

02:19:44.250 --> 02:19:47.545
- You know what top-secret is?
- Yes, sir.

02:19:47.629 --> 02:19:50.048
It's the kind of mission
where you get medals.

02:19:50.131 --> 02:19:52.300
But they send 'em to your relatives.

02:19:52.384 --> 02:19:57.055
Top-secret means you train for something
never done before in aviation history,

02:19:57.138 --> 02:20:00.433
and you go without knowing
where you're going.

02:20:00.517 --> 02:20:04.229
You do it on that 
basis or not at all.

02:20:04.312 --> 02:20:06.523
I'll go, sir.

02:20:06.606 --> 02:20:09.275
I'll go, too, sir.

02:20:10.360 --> 02:20:13.905
By the way, the Brits sent
over your personal effects.

02:20:13.988 --> 02:20:16.616
- Thank you, sir.
- There's only one more thing.

02:20:16.699 --> 02:20:20.578
Leave your goddamn hula shirts
at home.

02:20:23.623 --> 02:20:24.791
Dear Rafe.

02:20:24.874 --> 02:20:27.252
It's so strange
to be this far from you,

02:20:27.335 --> 02:20:31.423
but you should know this.
Every night ...

02:20:41.307 --> 02:20:44.727
I've been looking all over for you.

02:20:44.811 --> 02:20:46.479
Danny,

02:20:47.439 --> 02:20:50.900
this ain't no time
to leave things unsaid.

02:20:50.984 --> 02:20:57.198
Now, we gotta face facts here. The fact 
is, we just both love the same woman.

02:21:03.830 --> 02:21:07.834
She's the first girl
I ever felt this way about, Rafe.

02:21:10.211 --> 02:21:14.382
I couldn't help what happened
any more than you could.

02:21:16.885 --> 02:21:19.095
This is different, though, Danny.

02:21:19.179 --> 02:21:23.057
Evelyn already lost the man she loved
once. I don't want it to happen to her again.

02:21:23.141 --> 02:21:27.854
Guys like us got no choice.
This is war. She knows that.

02:21:27.937 --> 02:21:31.858
Danny, don't do this.
Don't go on this mission.

02:21:33.568 --> 02:21:36.279
You got nothing to prove.

02:21:36.362 --> 02:21:40.158
You've been trying to protect me
since we were kids.

02:21:40.241 --> 02:21:43.995
Yeah, well, you do tend to 
need it from time to time.

02:22:03.598 --> 02:22:08.144
The mission I'm asking you to volunteer 
for is exceptionally dangerous.

02:22:08.228 --> 02:22:10.772
Take a look at 
the man beside you.

02:22:10.855 --> 02:22:16.611
It's a good bet that in the 
next six weeks, you or he ...

02:22:16.694 --> 02:22:18.863
will be dead.

02:22:21.074 --> 02:22:24.577
Everyone brave enough
to accept this,

02:22:25.328 --> 02:22:26.663
step forward.

02:22:34.671 --> 02:22:39.509
Your grandmother could take a 
B-25 off on a mile-long runway.

02:22:39.592 --> 02:22:44.013
Well, I'm gonna train you
to do it in 467 feet.

02:22:44.097 --> 02:22:46.724
Because at 468 feet ...

02:22:47.725 --> 02:22:49.686
you're dead.

02:22:49.769 --> 02:22:53.690
And once you get it up, you'll 
learn to fly it like a fighter,

02:22:53.773 --> 02:22:55.900
30 feet off the ground.

02:22:55.984 --> 02:22:59.487
I want you to say hello to
Lieutenant Jack Richards, Navy Aviation.

02:22:59.571 --> 02:23:01.948
He's gonna help us
lighten these fat ladies here.

02:23:02.991 --> 02:23:06.494
Dump that ashcan. See that 
bomb sight? Get rid of it.

02:23:06.578 --> 02:23:08.204
Colonel, he's crazy.

02:23:08.288 --> 02:23:10.331
- The lady's fat.
- Listen to him.

02:23:10.415 --> 02:23:12.250
She's fat. We want a skinny lady.

02:23:17.422 --> 02:23:19.048
Max power.

02:23:21.968 --> 02:23:23.261
Get up, get up, get up.

02:23:24.137 --> 02:23:25.555
- Damn.
- How the heck?

02:23:25.638 --> 02:23:27.015
Damn.

02:23:34.814 --> 02:23:38.067
- They just keep rolling past that line.
- Maybe this is a bad idea.

02:23:38.151 --> 02:23:40.778
No, they're too heavy.
We gotta get drastic.

02:23:40.862 --> 02:23:42.447
This armoured plating's gotta go.

02:23:42.530 --> 02:23:45.283
I'm sure, I'm sure.
Lose it like a skirt, son.

02:23:45.366 --> 02:23:47.410
Release brakes.

02:23:48.995 --> 02:23:50.455
Come on, come on, come on.

02:23:52.332 --> 02:23:56.252
- God.
- Put every man on the line, now.

02:23:58.838 --> 02:24:01.716
Let's show these boys
how this thing is done.

02:24:03.009 --> 02:24:04.969
Come on. Max power.

02:24:09.974 --> 02:24:12.226
Well, if he can do it ...

02:24:29.369 --> 02:24:33.706
Well, gentlemen, now I can tell 
you that we're going to Tokyo.

02:24:35.041 --> 02:24:37.752
And we're gonna bomb it.

02:24:42.340 --> 02:24:46.761
That comes as a special request
directly from President Roosevelt.

02:24:46.844 --> 02:24:50.223
The navy's gonna sneak us about 
400 miles off the Japanese coast ...

02:24:50.306 --> 02:24:53.893
- and we'll launch from the carrier there.
- Has that ever been done before?

02:24:53.976 --> 02:24:57.980
- Taking army bombers off navy carriers?
- No.

02:24:58.064 --> 02:25:00.858
- OK.
- Any other questions?

02:25:00.942 --> 02:25:05.196
Well, sir, is it even possible to land
a B-25 on an aircraft carrier deck?

02:25:05.279 --> 02:25:10.451
That won't matter. As soon as we're
airborne, the carrier heads for Hawaii.

02:25:10.535 --> 02:25:12.704
But if the carriers head home,
where do we land?

02:25:12.787 --> 02:25:15.623
I have a phrase
I want you to memorise.

02:25:20.294 --> 02:25:22.588
It means "I am an American."

02:25:24.090 --> 02:25:26.008
In Chinese.

02:25:27.176 --> 02:25:30.805
Ain't gonna be any easier. That's 3 feet
shorter than our practice runway.

02:25:30.888 --> 02:25:33.057
- Fellas?
- Sir.

02:25:34.559 --> 02:25:35.768
Sir.

02:25:37.645 --> 02:25:40.398
Secretary of the Navy gave me these.

02:25:41.357 --> 02:25:43.985
- What are they?
- Friendship medals the Japanese gave us ...

02:25:44.068 --> 02:25:47.238
when they pretended they wanted peace.
- What'll you do with them?

02:25:47.321 --> 02:25:51.617
Wire them to the bombs
and give 'em back.

02:25:54.036 --> 02:25:57.707
- So, what's going on?
- Well, sir, we only have 16 planes.

02:25:57.790 --> 02:25:58.624
So?

02:25:58.708 --> 02:26:01.502
When the Japs hit us,
they had more than 300.

02:26:01.586 --> 02:26:04.213
I mean, how much difference
can we make?

02:26:04.297 --> 02:26:09.594
It's not that we're afraid, sir. But we might
die, and we want to know what it's for.

02:26:12.930 --> 02:26:16.642
You know, at Pearl,
they hit us with a sledgehammer.

02:26:17.477 --> 02:26:20.730
This raid,
even if we make it through,

02:26:20.813 --> 02:26:23.149
it'll only be a pinprick.

02:26:24.150 --> 02:26:27.278
But it'll be straight 
through their hearts.

02:26:27.361 --> 02:26:30.823
Victory belongs to those
that believe in it the most,

02:26:30.907 --> 02:26:33.493
and believe in it the longest.

02:26:34.118 --> 02:26:36.621
We're gonna believe.

02:26:36.704 --> 02:26:38.873
We're gonna make
America believe, too.

02:26:38.956 --> 02:26:41.042
Colonel? I need a minute.

02:26:43.544 --> 02:26:46.005
- Excuse me, Major Jackson?
- Yes?

02:26:47.006 --> 02:26:48.758
Do you remember me?

02:26:48.841 --> 02:26:50.676
Sure I do.

02:26:50.760 --> 02:26:52.970
I'm sorry.
I've been meaning to thank you.

02:26:53.054 --> 02:26:56.015
Well, maybe you can.
When the news starts coming in ...

02:26:56.098 --> 02:27:00.603
about those boys in the Doolittle outfit,
I wanna be in the command post.

02:27:00.686 --> 02:27:05.483
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

02:27:05.566 --> 02:27:08.945
How the hell do you know
about this mission, Lieutenant?

02:27:09.028 --> 02:27:10.947
Let's call it an 
inadvertent disclosure.

02:27:11.030 --> 02:27:14.659
You mean some flyboy you're 
dating shot his mouth off.

02:27:14.742 --> 02:27:19.914
Actually, it's about two pilots.
I know they're going into great danger.

02:27:19.997 --> 02:27:25.670
I just want to be there when the news
comes in to tell us if they've lived or died.

02:27:27.755 --> 02:27:30.174
Most officers would have
thrown you in the brig.

02:27:30.258 --> 02:27:35.471
Most nurses wouldn't have kept
their fingers plugged in your artery.

02:27:40.184 --> 02:27:42.520
I can't promise you anything.

02:27:48.609 --> 02:27:54.031
Hey, Red, you think they picked us
to do this cos we're young and dumb?

02:27:55.908 --> 02:27:58.911
Come on, Gooz,
we're the tip of the sword.

02:28:15.011 --> 02:28:19.724
In honour of our trip to Japan,
I got us some victory cigars.

02:28:20.266 --> 02:28:24.812
Victory cigars. There you go. Put that
in your inside pocket, next to your heart.

02:28:24.896 --> 02:28:29.400
You know, Jack, we may lose this battle,
but we're gonna win this war.

02:28:29.483 --> 02:28:31.903
- You know how I know?
- No.

02:28:33.988 --> 02:28:36.073
Them.

02:28:36.157 --> 02:28:38.868
Because they're rare.

02:28:38.951 --> 02:28:41.704
And at times like these,
you see them ...

02:28:43.205 --> 02:28:46.208
stepping forward.

02:28:46.292 --> 02:28:50.588
There's nothing stronger than 
the heart of a volunteer, Jack.

02:28:55.176 --> 02:28:58.804
My friends in the war department
don't want me to lead this raid ...

02:28:58.888 --> 02:29:02.099
because they say I'm too valuable.

02:29:02.183 --> 02:29:06.187
They don't want me up in the air
flying with the men that I've chosen,

02:29:06.270 --> 02:29:10.274
that I've chewed out,
cussed out, pushed to the limit,

02:29:12.360 --> 02:29:14.654
and that I've come to respect.

02:29:16.906 --> 02:29:22.536
They want me to stand on the flight deck
and wave you off. I don't see it that way.

02:29:23.537 --> 02:29:25.581
So I'm going with you.

02:29:29.418 --> 02:29:33.798
We take off tomorrow afternoon,
drop our fire, and head for China.

02:29:33.881 --> 02:29:38.260
Our mission is to hit military targets,
aircraft and tank factories.

02:29:38.344 --> 02:29:41.138
Colonel, you've given 
us homing beacons,

02:29:41.222 --> 02:29:44.225
but you told us China is overrun
with Japanese troops.

02:29:44.308 --> 02:29:47.979
- What if the beacons are switched off?
- Bring her down any way you can,

02:29:48.062 --> 02:29:52.566
- and do your best to avoid capture.
- What if we have to bail out over Japan?

02:29:52.650 --> 02:29:57.029
Well, in that situation,
I can't tell you what you should do.

02:29:57.113 --> 02:30:00.032
What would you do, Colonel?

02:30:01.993 --> 02:30:04.996
I wasn't built to be a prisoner,

02:30:05.997 --> 02:30:09.375
so I would have my crew bail out,

02:30:09.458 --> 02:30:11.669
I'd find the sweetest
military target I could ...

02:30:11.752 --> 02:30:15.297
and drive my plane right smack 
into the middle of it.

02:30:18.801 --> 02:30:21.137
But that's just me.

02:30:23.431 --> 02:30:25.474
I'm 45 years old. 
I'm an old man.

02:30:25.558 --> 02:30:30.771
You guys have your whole lives ahead 
of you, so what you do is up to you.

02:30:38.446 --> 02:30:41.532
The mission will launch
in a couple of hours.

02:30:41.615 --> 02:30:43.784
You'll stay right in here.

02:30:47.163 --> 02:30:50.708
Here. Stay here. Don't talk to 
them. They won't talk to you.

02:30:50.791 --> 02:30:55.337
Pretend to type whatever information
we pass you. That's it.

02:30:55.421 --> 02:30:59.300
This is Orphan Annie 
from Radio Tokyo.

02:30:59.383 --> 02:31:04.346
All the lonely boys in the South Pacific,
watch out ― the enemy will get you.

02:31:04.430 --> 02:31:06.599
Maybe she's right.

02:31:10.102 --> 02:31:12.772
Japs transmitting. 
Japs transmitting.

02:31:14.065 --> 02:31:16.525
Captain, radar reports
Japanese patrol boats.

02:31:16.609 --> 02:31:18.277
- Range 400 yards.
- How many yards?

02:31:18.360 --> 02:31:19.904
400 yards and closing, sir.

02:31:19.987 --> 02:31:23.032
Richards, Japs. 
400 yards. Let's go.

02:31:23.115 --> 02:31:25.910
Admiral Halsey's ordering
the cruisers to open fire.

02:31:25.993 --> 02:31:28.871
We gotta sink these Jap boats
before they give away our position.

02:31:28.954 --> 02:31:30.164
Go to general quarters.

02:31:30.247 --> 02:31:32.666
Go, go, go, go.

02:31:33.584 --> 02:31:35.086
My God.

02:31:35.169 --> 02:31:37.797
- General quarters.
- This can't be good.

02:31:37.880 --> 02:31:40.174
All hands, man your battle stations.

02:31:44.136 --> 02:31:47.181
Japs one mile away.
They reported our position.

02:31:47.264 --> 02:31:50.226
We're supposed to launch
400 miles away. How far are we?

02:31:50.309 --> 02:31:51.811
624 miles.

02:31:51.894 --> 02:31:54.063
- Jesus.
- What do you want to do?

02:31:54.146 --> 02:31:56.190
624 ...

02:31:59.110 --> 02:32:03.948
Colonel, I don't know if the planes can 
carry enough fuel to make it to China.

02:32:04.031 --> 02:32:06.200
Now. We launch now.

02:32:07.827 --> 02:32:09.912
Army pilots. Man your planes.

02:32:09.995 --> 02:32:11.997
Man your planes.

02:32:14.667 --> 02:32:16.794
They're shooting at something.

02:32:16.877 --> 02:32:18.963
- Let's go.
- Come on.

02:32:30.558 --> 02:32:32.893
Colonel.
We're too far out to make it.

02:32:32.977 --> 02:32:35.938
These planes need more fuel,
but they can't get too heavy.

02:32:36.021 --> 02:32:39.775
Listen. Strip everything out of this 
plane you don't need, and I mean now.

02:32:42.027 --> 02:32:43.571
Start pre-flight. Let's go.

02:32:43.654 --> 02:32:46.323
Add ten more cans of 
fuel for each plane.

02:32:46.407 --> 02:32:48.242
Every plane.

02:32:51.537 --> 02:32:54.748
- Let's go. Move.
- Come on, guys, get up there.

02:32:54.832 --> 02:32:56.750
Lose those suitcases, now.

02:32:56.834 --> 02:32:58.502
- What's your favourite gun?
- What?

02:32:58.586 --> 02:33:01.839
You want to get off this deck,
give me one of those guns now.

02:33:01.922 --> 02:33:04.341
It's still too heavy.

02:33:05.009 --> 02:33:09.513
Go to the kitchen, get some broomsticks.
Cut 'em down, paint 'em black.

02:33:09.597 --> 02:33:12.683
We're gonna put a broomstick
where this gun was.

02:33:12.766 --> 02:33:14.435
What are you doing to my plane?

02:33:14.518 --> 02:33:20.482
Tell your crew to piss before they take 
off, or they're not gonna clear the deck.

02:33:20.566 --> 02:33:26.030
- We've got broomsticks for tail guns.
- Yeah. Maybe it'll scare 'em.

02:33:26.113 --> 02:33:29.241
- You take care of yourself up there.
- Yeah, I will.

02:33:29.325 --> 02:33:32.328
Danny, you be careful, you hear me?

02:33:32.411 --> 02:33:34.580
I will. I'll see you, Rafe.

02:33:34.663 --> 02:33:36.790
Rafe. We're the tip of the sword.

02:33:42.963 --> 02:33:45.966
- Turning on one.
- Turning on two.

02:33:52.514 --> 02:33:54.350
You ready for this?

02:33:56.310 --> 02:33:59.188
- Superchargers low and latched.
- Low and latched.

02:33:59.271 --> 02:34:03.192
- We're full into the wind.
- More speed. More speed.

02:34:14.662 --> 02:34:17.081
- Are you nervous?
- No. Yes, sir. Yes.

02:34:17.164 --> 02:34:18.666
When did you find religion?

02:34:18.749 --> 02:34:21.293
When you assigned me
to this mission, sir.

02:34:21.377 --> 02:34:22.586
Do me a favour.

02:34:22.670 --> 02:34:25.089
- What's that, Colonel?
- Pray for both of us.

02:34:25.172 --> 02:34:27.800
- Tell me when.
- Let's go.

02:34:36.558 --> 02:34:38.519
Max power.

02:34:41.272 --> 02:34:43.315
Please.

02:34:43.983 --> 02:34:46.402
Come on. Come on.

02:34:56.912 --> 02:34:58.205
Way to go.

02:34:59.999 --> 02:35:02.501
Jesus, that was short.

02:35:04.336 --> 02:35:06.463
Move 'em up.

02:35:06.547 --> 02:35:09.633
All right, full power. Full power.
Here we go.

02:35:10.884 --> 02:35:12.720
Pull back.

02:35:23.772 --> 02:35:25.858
Come on, here we go, here we go.

02:35:37.453 --> 02:35:38.954
We made it.

02:35:56.972 --> 02:35:59.641
From Berlin, Rome, and Tokyo,

02:35:59.725 --> 02:36:01.518
we have been described ...

02:36:01.602 --> 02:36:04.563
as a nation of weaklings
and playboys ...

02:36:04.646 --> 02:36:08.317
who hire British or Russian
or Chinese soldiers ...

02:36:08.400 --> 02:36:10.861
to do our fighting for us.

02:36:10.944 --> 02:36:13.697
Let them repeat that now.

02:36:13.781 --> 02:36:17.368
Let them tell that
to General MacArthur and his men.

02:36:17.451 --> 02:36:21.205
Let them tell that
to the soldiers who today ...

02:36:21.288 --> 02:36:25.084
are fighting hard
in the far waters of the Pacific.

02:36:25.167 --> 02:36:29.213
Let them tell that to the boys
in the Flying Fortresses.

02:36:29.296 --> 02:36:32.299
Let them tell that to the marines.

02:36:33.759 --> 02:36:37.054
That's Japan right there, fellas.
Tighten up back there.

02:36:37.137 --> 02:36:39.640
Man your guns.

02:36:39.723 --> 02:36:42.601
We're in the enemy's backyard.

02:36:42.684 --> 02:36:45.604
All right, look alive back there.
I see coastline.

02:36:52.611 --> 02:36:54.321
Heads up, boys. Heads up.

02:36:59.118 --> 02:37:03.038
- Man your guns back there.
- I'm cocked and locked.

02:37:03.122 --> 02:37:04.581
Get ready, suckers.

02:37:12.589 --> 02:37:17.136
Approaching targets for bombing 
raid. Open bomb bay doors.

02:37:17.886 --> 02:37:20.889
Ripley, you got a target in sight?

02:37:20.973 --> 02:37:22.808
37 degrees. Target in sight.

02:37:31.942 --> 02:37:34.236
All right, boys, 
let's knock their clocks off.

02:37:34.319 --> 02:37:36.363
- Drop your ordnance.
- Bombs away.

02:37:36.447 --> 02:37:38.282
One away.

02:37:38.365 --> 02:37:40.534
- Bombs away.
- Bombs away.

02:37:40.617 --> 02:37:42.327
Two away.

02:37:51.253 --> 02:37:52.921
Three away. Four away.

02:37:57.092 --> 02:37:59.052
We caught 'em by surprise.

02:37:59.136 --> 02:38:02.264
- Dropping ordnance.
- Bombs away. Bombs away.

02:38:02.347 --> 02:38:04.600
... factory.

02:38:11.148 --> 02:38:13.942
- We got it.
- We hit our targets. Good job, raiders.

02:38:27.873 --> 02:38:30.626
Jesus. What ...?

02:38:32.002 --> 02:38:33.879
We got flak everywhere.

02:38:36.048 --> 02:38:39.384
- Go down there and get Gooz.
- I want everyone to separate.

02:38:39.968 --> 02:38:42.679
Clean that up. Try and clean that up.

02:38:42.763 --> 02:38:44.932
They're shooting flak at us.

02:38:55.984 --> 02:38:59.112
We gotta try and 
get out of this shit, Gooz.

02:39:01.323 --> 02:39:04.576
- We got a fire. We got a fire.
- Tail's hit.

02:39:04.660 --> 02:39:07.412
The electrics.
We got a fire back here.

02:39:07.496 --> 02:39:09.957
I gotta short this out.

02:39:10.040 --> 02:39:12.709
Get into the clouds, Danny,
right now. Get up ...

02:39:26.932 --> 02:39:28.267
Goddammit.

02:39:29.560 --> 02:39:30.936
Red, go check it out.

02:39:36.358 --> 02:39:39.736
- I'm getting covered.
- I just hope they don't hit a prop.

02:39:44.825 --> 02:39:47.536
- I'm hit.
- They're gonna tear this plane apart.

02:39:49.246 --> 02:39:51.248
Red, take it up, 800 feet.

02:39:55.627 --> 02:39:58.964
I think Theo's dead.
Theo, wake up.

02:39:59.047 --> 02:40:01.091
Theo.

02:40:01.174 --> 02:40:03.760
Get into the clouds, Danny, 
right now. Get up in that soup.

02:40:04.052 --> 02:40:06.221
We're gonna pull out of this,
Gooz. Come on.

02:40:19.234 --> 02:40:21.612
Thank you, George.

02:40:25.657 --> 02:40:27.034
What is it, General?

02:40:27.117 --> 02:40:31.830
Colonel Doolittle had to advance his
execution order by 12 hours, Mr. President.

02:40:31.913 --> 02:40:33.624
There will be no homing beacons.

02:40:33.707 --> 02:40:36.335
The plane carrying them
crashed en route to China.

02:40:36.418 --> 02:40:39.671
And our bombers may lack the fuel
to reach the mainland, sir.

02:40:39.755 --> 02:40:45.302
So our boys are flying blind
on empty tanks.

02:40:47.346 --> 02:40:49.765
God help them.

02:40:57.064 --> 02:40:59.316
We're still not getting a signal.

02:40:59.399 --> 02:41:04.321
All ocean and no land.
Homing in on nothing.

02:41:06.698 --> 02:41:08.784
How many cans of fuel we got left?

02:41:08.867 --> 02:41:11.536
These are all empty.

02:41:12.079 --> 02:41:14.998
- Is this all you got?
- That's all we got, Red.

02:41:15.082 --> 02:41:18.418
Rafe. You'd better pray for land.

02:41:23.423 --> 02:41:26.176
Break radio silence.

02:41:26.259 --> 02:41:31.306
I'm sorry, gentlemen.
You're all brave souls.

02:41:31.390 --> 02:41:35.686
Among the bravest I've ever had
the privilege of flying with.

02:41:35.769 --> 02:41:37.604
But we're on our own.

02:41:42.067 --> 02:41:45.070
This really was a suicide mission.

02:42:00.377 --> 02:42:04.297
Engine one's fluctuating.
We're gonna lose it any minute.

02:42:05.549 --> 02:42:09.219
- Rafe, you gotta prime it.
- I'm priming it. How about now?

02:42:12.139 --> 02:42:15.183
I see the coast. I see the coast.

02:42:16.268 --> 02:42:19.604
Copy that, Rafe.
We're gonna make it.

02:42:19.688 --> 02:42:22.691
Danny, follow me. We can make this.
I can see the coast now.

02:42:22.774 --> 02:42:27.112
- It's only a few miles out. Follow me.
- We gotta find a soft landing spot.

02:42:27.195 --> 02:42:31.199
I'm pushing up on two. Fellas,
it's gonna be a hard landing. Hold on.

02:42:31.283 --> 02:42:34.327
I see rice paddies.
We'll bring it in right here.

02:42:36.705 --> 02:42:41.126
God, engine one's dead. We're 
gonna lose engine two any second.

02:42:44.629 --> 02:42:46.923
We can make it in. Easy.

02:42:47.007 --> 02:42:50.093
Pull it back, we'll glide in,
go in on fumes.

02:42:52.387 --> 02:42:55.724
Japs. We got Jap patrols
all over the place.

02:42:55.807 --> 02:42:58.435
Japs. Land somewhere else.

02:42:58.518 --> 02:43:00.937
Strap yourselves in.
We're coming in hard.

02:43:01.021 --> 02:43:02.647
We're a dead stick.

02:43:02.731 --> 02:43:04.191
Get outta the nose.

02:43:05.442 --> 02:43:07.819
Hold on, boys. We're going down.

02:43:09.946 --> 02:43:11.323
Watch the trees.

02:43:20.749 --> 02:43:21.917
God.

02:43:35.889 --> 02:43:38.266
Everyone all right?

02:43:38.350 --> 02:43:41.228
I'm OK. I'm OK.

02:43:41.311 --> 02:43:43.814
Where's Ripley?

02:43:43.897 --> 02:43:46.483
He's dead.

02:43:46.566 --> 02:43:49.361
Watch for Japs.

02:43:57.327 --> 02:43:59.496
- Jap patrols.
- Take cover.

02:44:17.264 --> 02:44:19.516
- Who's got extra magazines?
- I got 'em.

02:44:19.599 --> 02:44:22.519
We gotta get up into those hills,
find the Chinese.

02:44:27.774 --> 02:44:30.026
They got us pinned down.

02:44:39.828 --> 02:44:42.163
- Danny.
- Rafe. Rafe, no.

02:44:42.247 --> 02:44:45.375
- Danny.
- Rafe. You don't have a chance.

02:44:49.754 --> 02:44:51.840
Goddammit. Danny.

02:44:51.923 --> 02:44:54.259
Come on.

02:44:56.720 --> 02:44:58.930
Gooz? You OK, man?

02:44:59.014 --> 02:45:02.726
Danny? Shit. Anthony.

02:45:02.809 --> 02:45:05.562
Gooz. Can you hear me?

02:45:05.645 --> 02:45:07.647
- Yeah.
- Come on.

02:45:09.733 --> 02:45:13.194
- Danny. Easy, easy, easy.
- I've had better landings.

02:45:13.278 --> 02:45:16.281
- You saved us back there.
- I got something in my neck.

02:45:16.364 --> 02:45:18.450
- Let me pull this out.
- Where's Gooz?

02:45:18.533 --> 02:45:20.952
He's fine. 
He's right over there.

02:45:38.511 --> 02:45:39.554
Rafe.

02:46:39.864 --> 02:46:41.616
Grenade.

02:46:50.834 --> 02:46:53.461
Danny. Danny.

02:46:54.337 --> 02:46:56.673
Danny.

02:46:59.634 --> 02:47:01.678
- Hold on.
- Rafe.

02:47:01.761 --> 02:47:05.974
Hold on, now. I got you.
You're all right. You're all right.

02:47:06.057 --> 02:47:10.353
I'm not gonna make it.

02:47:12.981 --> 02:47:15.567
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are. Now look at me.

02:47:15.650 --> 02:47:20.113
Rafe, I'm so cold. I'm so cold.

02:47:20.989 --> 02:47:23.283
You're all right.

02:47:27.912 --> 02:47:31.291
Hey, Rafe?
Can you do me a favour?

02:47:31.374 --> 02:47:32.917
What?

02:47:33.001 --> 02:47:37.338
Can you have someone else
write my name on the tombstone?

02:47:38.006 --> 02:47:40.175
You're not gonna die.
Look at me, listen to me.

02:47:40.258 --> 02:47:44.304
You ain't gonna die,
you hear me? Danny.

02:47:44.387 --> 02:47:47.557
Danny, you can't die.
You can't die. You know why?

02:47:47.640 --> 02:47:51.019
Because you're gonna be a father.

02:47:51.102 --> 02:47:54.856
You're gonna be a daddy.
I wasn't supposed to tell you.

02:47:56.274 --> 02:47:58.610
You're gonna be a father.

02:48:00.195 --> 02:48:02.363
Please.

02:48:05.867 --> 02:48:08.036
No. You are.

02:48:17.796 --> 02:48:19.798
Danny.

02:48:25.428 --> 02:48:27.472
Please, please.

02:48:27.555 --> 02:48:29.140
Please.

02:48:32.102 --> 02:48:33.812
God.

02:48:34.813 --> 02:48:37.065
Please, Danny.

02:48:47.575 --> 02:48:50.578
Hold your fire.
They're Chinese.

02:50:11.659 --> 02:50:14.704
When the action is over
and we look back,

02:50:14.787 --> 02:50:17.916
we understand both more and less.

02:50:17.999 --> 02:50:20.084
This much is certain ―

02:50:20.168 --> 02:50:24.214
before the Doolittle raid,
America knew nothing but defeat.

02:50:24.297 --> 02:50:27.550
After it, there was hope of victory.

02:50:27.634 --> 02:50:32.430
Japan realised for the first time that
they could lose, and began to pull back.

02:50:32.513 --> 02:50:36.392
America realised that she 
would win, and surged forward.

02:50:36.476 --> 02:50:41.105
It was a war that changed 
America, and the world.

02:50:41.189 --> 02:50:45.485
Dorie Miller was the first black 
American to be awarded the Navy Cross.

02:50:45.568 --> 02:50:49.822
But he would not be the last.
He joined a brotherhood of heroes.

02:50:56.829 --> 02:50:59.582
That's for all the raiders.

02:51:08.883 --> 02:51:12.178
World War II for us 
began at Pearl Harbor,

02:51:12.262 --> 02:51:17.725
and 1,177 men still lie entombed
in the battleship Arizona.

02:51:18.685 --> 02:51:22.981
America suffered,
but America grew stronger.

02:51:23.064 --> 02:51:25.149
It was not inevitable.

02:51:25.233 --> 02:51:27.860
The times tried our souls,

02:51:27.944 --> 02:51:31.406
and through the trial,
we overcame.

02:51:52.343 --> 02:51:55.596
Hey, Danny,
how'd you like to go flying?

02:51:57.307 --> 02:51:59.684
Come here.
