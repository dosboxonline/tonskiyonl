00:35.869 --> 00:38.713
<i>The second star to the right</i>

00:38.789 --> 00:42.589
<i>Shines in the night for you</i>

00:42.668 --> 00:45.888
<i>To tell you that the dreams you plan</i>

00:45.963 --> 00:49.809
<i>Really can come true</i>

00:50.384 --> 00:53.228
<i>The second star to the right</i>

00:53.303 --> 00:57.774
<i>Shines with a light so rare</i>

00:57.849 --> 01:01.649
<i>And if it's Never Land you need</i>

01:01.728 --> 01:05.778
<i>Its light will lead you there</i>

01:05.983 --> 01:08.827
<i>Twinkle, twinkle little star</i>

01:08.902 --> 01:13.078
<i>So we'll know where you are</i>

01:13.156 --> 01:17.161
<i>Gleaming in the skies above</i>

01:17.244 --> 01:19.872
<i>Lead us to the land</i>

01:19.955 --> 01:24.426
<i>We dream of</i>

01:24.501 --> 01:28.847
<i>And when our journey is through</i>

01:28.922 --> 01:31.425
<i>Each time we say</i>

01:31.508 --> 01:34.478
<i>Good night</i>

01:34.678 --> 01:40.435
<i>We'll thank the little star that shines</i>

01:41.476 --> 01:45.697
<i>The second from</i>

01:45.772 --> 01:49.276
<i>The right</i>

01:53.572 --> 01:56.121
<i>All this has happened before.</i>

01:56.199 --> 01:59.248
<i>And it will all happen again.</i>

01:59.328 --> 02:02.332
<i>But this time it happened in London.</i>

02:05.083 --> 02:08.053
<i>It happened on a quiet street
in Bloomsbury.</i>

02:09.588 --> 02:14.094
<i>That corner house over there is
the home of the Darling family.</i>

02:14.551 --> 02:17.179
<i>And Peter Pan chose
this particular house</i>

02:17.262 --> 02:20.562
<i>because there were people here
who believed in him.</i>

02:21.016 --> 02:22.859
<i>There was Mrs Darling.</i>

02:24.561 --> 02:28.486
George, dear, do hurry. We mustn't
be late for the party, you know.

02:28.565 --> 02:32.741
<i>Mrs Darling believed that Peter Pan
was the spirit of youth.</i>

02:33.111 --> 02:34.363
<i>But Mr Darling...</i>

02:34.446 --> 02:38.917
Mary, unless I find my cuff links
we don't go to the party.

02:39.284 --> 02:43.334
And if we don't go to the party, I can
never show my face in the office again.

02:43.413 --> 02:45.006
And if I can never...

02:45.248 --> 02:48.627
<i>Well, Mr Darling was a practical man.</i>

02:49.503 --> 02:52.473
<i>The boys, however, John and Michael,</i>

02:52.923 --> 02:55.301
<i>believed Peter Pan was a real person</i>

02:55.592 --> 02:58.812
<i>and made him the hero
of all their nursery games.</i>

02:58.887 --> 03:00.935
Blast you, Peter Pan!

03:03.058 --> 03:06.983
Take that! Give up, Captain Hook?
Give up?

03:07.062 --> 03:09.861
Never! I'll teach you to cut off me hand!

03:09.940 --> 03:12.944
Oh, no, John. It was the left hand.

03:13.485 --> 03:15.579
Yes. Thank you, Wendy.

03:15.654 --> 03:19.124
<i>Wendy, the eldest, not only believed,</i>

03:19.783 --> 03:22.377
<i>she was the supreme
authority on Peter Pan</i>

03:22.452 --> 03:24.375
<i>and all his marvellous adventures.</i>

03:24.454 --> 03:28.129
Nana, must we always take
that nasty tonic?

03:28.291 --> 03:31.135
<i>Nana, the nursemaid, being a dog,</i>

03:31.712 --> 03:34.215
<i>kept her opinions to herself</i>

03:34.297 --> 03:37.801
<i>and viewed the whole affair
with a certain tolerance.</i>

03:44.891 --> 03:46.143
Take that!

03:46.518 --> 03:49.488
Insolent boy! I'll slash you to ribbons!

03:49.563 --> 03:52.487
And I'll cut you to pieces.

03:55.318 --> 03:58.743
- Careful, Michael, my glasses.
- I'm sorry, John.

03:59.573 --> 04:01.621
You'll never leave this ship alive!

04:01.700 --> 04:03.452
Oh, yes, I will.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.416
Take that!

04:11.418 --> 04:14.922
Scuttle me bones, boy,
I'll slit your gizzard.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.387
Oh, no, you won't.

04:17.466 --> 04:20.265
Back, back, back, you villain!

04:20.677 --> 04:23.977
- Insolent pup!
- Wicked pirate!

04:24.973 --> 04:26.145
I got ya.

04:26.224 --> 04:28.693
You didn't either.
You never touched me.

04:29.186 --> 04:32.861
Take that and that! And that!

04:32.939 --> 04:35.112
Boys, boys, less noise, please.

04:37.944 --> 04:40.948
- Oh, hello, Father.
- You old bilge rat.

04:41.031 --> 04:43.659
What? Now, see here, Michael...

04:43.742 --> 04:47.588
Not you, Father.
You see, he's Peter Pan.

04:47.662 --> 04:50.632
- And John's Captain Hook.
- Yes, yes, of course.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.005
Have you seen my cuff...

04:53.668 --> 04:56.171
Nana, for goodness sake!

04:56.463 --> 04:58.716
Where are those cuff links?

04:59.591 --> 05:03.516
- Cuff links, Father?
- Yes, the gold ones.

05:03.929 --> 05:06.978
Michael, the buried treasure.
Where is it?

05:07.057 --> 05:09.151
- I don't know.
- The map then.

05:09.476 --> 05:12.195
- Where's the treasure map?
- It got lost.

05:12.270 --> 05:15.570
- Good heavens, my shirt front!
- Hurray! You found it!

05:15.649 --> 05:17.993
- You found it!
- Yes, so I have.

05:18.068 --> 05:21.368
And hereafter... Don't paw me, Michael.

05:21.530 --> 05:23.624
This is my last clean...

05:23.907 --> 05:24.999
No!

05:25.909 --> 05:27.161
No!

05:27.244 --> 05:29.713
George, dear,
we must hurry or we'll be...

05:29.788 --> 05:33.543
- Mary, look!
- George.

05:33.625 --> 05:36.504
- It's only chalk, Father.
- Why, Michael.

05:36.586 --> 05:39.806
It's not his fault. It's in the story.

05:40.382 --> 05:43.181
- And Wendy says...
- Wendy? Story?

05:43.635 --> 05:47.060
I might have known. Wendy!

05:47.931 --> 05:50.650
- Wendy!
- Yes, Father?

05:50.725 --> 05:53.820
- Would you kindly ex...
- Oh, Mother!

05:53.937 --> 05:57.111
- You look simply lovely.
- Thank you, dear.

05:57.190 --> 05:59.284
- Wendy.
- Just my old gown made over.

05:59.359 --> 06:03.034
- But it did turn out rather nicely...
- Mary, if you don't mind.

06:03.113 --> 06:06.959
Why, Father,
what have you done to your shirt?

06:07.200 --> 06:09.498
What have I...

06:11.204 --> 06:13.832
Now, George, really. It comes right off.

06:13.915 --> 06:18.421
That's no excuse.
Wendy, haven't I warned you?

06:18.503 --> 06:21.052
Stuffing the boys' heads
with a lot of silly stories.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.600
- Oh, but they aren't.
- I say they are!

06:23.967 --> 06:26.436
Captain Crook! Peter Pirate!

06:26.511 --> 06:28.013
Peter Pan, Father.

06:28.096 --> 06:31.145
Pan! Pirate! Poppycock!

06:31.224 --> 06:33.192
- No, Father.
- You don't understand.

06:33.268 --> 06:37.944
Absolute poppycock!
And let me tell you, this ridiculous...

06:38.023 --> 06:39.240
Now, George.

06:39.316 --> 06:41.410
"Now, George."

06:41.818 --> 06:43.991
"Now, George!"

06:44.070 --> 06:46.744
Well, "Now, George," will have his say!

06:46.823 --> 06:48.075
Please, dear.

06:48.158 --> 06:50.456
Mary, the child's growing up.

06:51.202 --> 06:53.455
It's high time
she had a room of her own.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.085
- Father!
- George!

06:55.165 --> 06:56.667
- What?
- No!

06:57.667 --> 06:59.169
I mean it!

06:59.252 --> 07:02.927
Young lady, this is your last night
in the nursery.

07:03.340 --> 07:06.014
And that's my last word on the matter...

07:19.356 --> 07:20.699
No!

07:23.443 --> 07:25.036
No!

07:38.625 --> 07:40.627
Poor Nana.

07:41.086 --> 07:42.929
"Poor Nana?"

07:43.630 --> 07:45.883
This is the last straw!

07:45.966 --> 07:48.469
Out! Out, I say!

07:48.718 --> 07:51.096
- No, Father, no!
- Yes!

07:51.179 --> 07:54.774
There'll be no more dogs
for nursemaids in this house!

07:56.267 --> 07:58.019
Goodbye, Nana.

07:59.562 --> 08:03.283
"Poor Nana." Oh, yes, "Poor Nana."

08:03.817 --> 08:07.117
But "Poor Father?" Oh, no!

08:07.862 --> 08:10.365
Blast it! Where is that rope?

08:12.492 --> 08:13.664
Thank you.

08:18.623 --> 08:21.467
Dash it all, Nana,
don't look at me like that.

08:21.543 --> 08:24.012
It's nothing personal. It's just that

08:25.463 --> 08:30.014
Well, you're not really a nurse at all.
You're... Well, a dog.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.855
And the children aren't puppies.
They're people.

08:33.929 --> 08:37.433
And sooner or later, Nana,
people have to grow up.

08:37.976 --> 08:40.980
But, Mother, I don't want to grow up.

08:41.395 --> 08:45.367
Now, dear, don't worry
about it any more tonight.

08:45.483 --> 08:49.238
He called Peter Pan
"absolute poppycock."

08:49.320 --> 08:54.076
I'm sure he didn't mean it, John.
Father was just upset.

08:54.325 --> 08:58.831
Poor Nana, out there all alone.

08:58.913 --> 09:01.962
No more tears, Michael.
It's a warm night.

09:02.167 --> 09:03.510
She'll be all right.

09:04.586 --> 09:07.180
- Mother.
- What is it, dear?

09:07.630 --> 09:11.100
- Buried treasure.
- Now, children.

09:11.426 --> 09:13.724
Don't judge your father too harshly.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.433
After all, he really loves you very much.

09:18.224 --> 09:21.194
Don't lock it, Mother.
He might come back.

09:21.644 --> 09:24.568
-"He?"
- Yes, Peter Pan.

09:24.773 --> 09:28.653
You see, I found something
that belongs to him.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.412
And what's that?

09:31.905 --> 09:33.077
His shadow.

09:33.156 --> 09:34.453
"Shadow?"

09:34.574 --> 09:35.996
Nana had it.

09:36.284 --> 09:39.083
But I took it away.

09:43.333 --> 09:45.131
Yes, of course.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.841
Good night, dear.

09:50.715 --> 09:54.436
But, George, do you think the children
will be safe without Nana?

09:54.511 --> 09:56.764
Safe? Of course they'll be safe.
Why not?

09:56.846 --> 10:00.271
Well, Wendy said something
about a shadow, and I...

10:00.350 --> 10:03.194
- Shadow? Whose shadow?
- Peter Pan's.

10:03.645 --> 10:06.524
Peter Pan... Peter Pan!

10:07.315 --> 10:11.661
You don't say. Goodness gracious,
whatever shall we do?

10:11.736 --> 10:13.204
- But, George...
- Sound the alarm!

10:13.321 --> 10:16.621
- Call Scotland Yard!
- There must have been someone.

10:17.325 --> 10:20.124
Mary, of all the impossible,
childish fiddle-faddle.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.963
Peter Pan indeed.

10:22.038 --> 10:25.292
How can we expect the children
to grow up and be practical...

10:25.375 --> 10:27.343
- George...
-...when you're as bad as they are.

10:27.418 --> 10:30.262
No wonder Wendy
gets these idiotic ideas.

11:01.744 --> 11:04.088
Over there, Tink, in its den.

11:04.622 --> 11:05.748
Is it there?

11:08.918 --> 11:10.465
Must be here somewhere.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.057
Tink!

11:19.554 --> 11:22.558
Stop playing
and help me find my shadow.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.736
Shadow. Oh, shadow.

12:25.453 --> 12:29.503
Peter Pan! Oh, Peter!

12:29.749 --> 12:33.094
I knew you'd come back.
I saved your shadow for you.

12:33.169 --> 12:35.263
I do hope it isn't rumpled.

12:35.338 --> 12:38.182
You look exactly
the way I thought you would.

12:38.341 --> 12:40.890
A little taller perhaps. But then...

12:41.678 --> 12:43.897
You can't stick it on with soap, Peter.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.391
It needs sewing.
That's the proper way to do it.

12:47.016 --> 12:51.021
Come to think of it, I've never thought
about it, sewing shadows.

12:51.521 --> 12:53.694
I knew it was your shadow
the minute I saw it.

12:53.773 --> 12:57.118
I said to myself, "I'll put it away
for him until he comes back.

12:57.193 --> 13:00.823
"He's sure to come back."
And you did, didn't you, Peter?

13:01.030 --> 13:03.829
After all, one can't leave
his shadow lying about

13:03.908 --> 13:06.878
and not miss it sooner or later.
Don't you agree?

13:06.995 --> 13:10.295
What I don't understand is how
Nana got it in the first place.

13:10.373 --> 13:13.468
She really isn't... Sit down.
It won't take long.

13:13.543 --> 13:16.717
She really isn't vicious.
She's a wonderful nurse.

13:17.005 --> 13:19.428
- Father says...
- Girls talk too much.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.972
Yes, girls talk too...

13:23.219 --> 13:25.267
Well, get on with it, girl.

13:25.346 --> 13:26.689
My name is Wendy.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.643
- Wendy Moira Angela Darl...
- Wendy's enough.

13:31.060 --> 13:33.529
But how did Nana get
your shadow, Peter?

13:33.604 --> 13:36.198
Jumped at me the other night
at the window.

13:36.399 --> 13:37.992
Well, what were you doing there?

13:38.067 --> 13:40.035
I came to listen to the stories.

13:40.570 --> 13:43.540
My stories? But they're all about you.

13:43.614 --> 13:47.744
Of course. That's why I like 'em.
I tell 'em to the Lost Boys.

13:48.244 --> 13:50.463
The Lost Boys... Oh, I remember.

13:50.913 --> 13:52.756
They're your men.

13:52.999 --> 13:55.218
I'm so glad you came back tonight.

13:55.293 --> 13:57.421
- I might never have seen you.
- Why?

13:57.754 --> 14:00.428
- Because I have to grow up tomorrow.
- Grow up!

14:00.506 --> 14:02.679
Tonight's my last night in the nursery.

14:02.759 --> 14:05.433
But that means no more stories.

14:07.430 --> 14:10.604
No! I won't have it. Come on!

14:10.933 --> 14:12.651
But where are we going?

14:12.727 --> 14:14.445
To Never Land.

14:15.772 --> 14:18.696
- Never Land!
- You'll never grow up there.

14:19.400 --> 14:22.654
Peter, it will be so wonderful.

14:23.446 --> 14:26.495
But wait. What would Mother say?

14:26.949 --> 14:28.747
Mother? What's Mother?

14:28.826 --> 14:31.875
Why, Peter, a mother is someone who...

14:32.080 --> 14:34.253
Who loves and cares for you

14:34.332 --> 14:37.427
-and tells you stories.
- Good! You can be our mother.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.596
- Come on.
- Now, just a minute, I...

14:39.670 --> 14:41.718
Let me see now. I have to pack.

14:41.798 --> 14:45.223
And I must leave a note when
I'll be back. I couldn't stay too long.

14:45.301 --> 14:48.475
And then I'll have to...
Oh, but Never Land.

14:49.013 --> 14:51.232
I'm so happy I---

14:51.307 --> 14:53.355
I think I'll give you a kiss.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.482
What's a kiss?

15:00.274 --> 15:02.743
Well, I'll show you.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.655
Stop! Stop it, Tink!

15:10.493 --> 15:13.667
John, John, wake up! He's here.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.880
Jiminy!

15:18.292 --> 15:20.044
What in the world was that?

15:20.169 --> 15:22.217
Tinker Bell.
Don't know what got into her.

15:22.296 --> 15:24.799
Hello, Peter Pan. I'm Michael.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.431
And my name is John. How do you do?

15:27.510 --> 15:30.514
- Hello.
- Look, a firefly.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.765
- A pixie.
- Amazing!

15:36.269 --> 15:38.613
- What's the pixie doing?
- Talking.

15:38.688 --> 15:41.988
- What did she say?
- She says you're a big, ugly girl.

15:44.610 --> 15:47.204
Well, I think she's lovely.

15:48.990 --> 15:52.039
- Well, come on, Wendy, let's go.
- Where are we going?

15:52.118 --> 15:54.291
- To Never Land.
- Never Land!

15:54.370 --> 15:56.372
- Peter's taking us.
-"Us?"

15:56.956 --> 15:59.835
Well, of course.
I couldn't go without Michael and John.

15:59.917 --> 16:03.672
I should like very much to cross swords
with real buccaneers.

16:03.754 --> 16:06.382
Yes, and fight pirates too.

16:08.050 --> 16:11.020
Well, all right, but ya gotta take orders.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.347
- Aye, aye, sir.
- Me too.

16:14.098 --> 16:16.146
But, Peter,
how do we get to Never Land?

16:16.309 --> 16:18.812
- Fly, of course.
- Fly?

16:19.270 --> 16:22.695
It's easy. All you have to do is to...

16:22.940 --> 16:25.784
ls to...

16:27.737 --> 16:29.865
- That's funny.
- What's the matter?

16:29.947 --> 16:31.995
- Don't you know?
- Sure.

16:32.074 --> 16:34.998
It's just that
I never thought about it before.

16:35.453 --> 16:38.923
Say, that's it!
You think of a wonderful thought.

16:38.998 --> 16:40.625
- Any happy, little thought?
- Any happy, little thought?

16:42.335 --> 16:45.509
- Like toys at Christmas?
- Sleigh bells, snow?

16:45.630 --> 16:48.349
Yep! Watch me now. Here I go!

16:49.175 --> 16:50.927
It's easier than pie.

16:51.802 --> 16:54.305
- He can fly!
- He can fly!

16:54.514 --> 16:55.686
He flewed!

16:57.308 --> 16:58.685
Now you W-

16:58.768 --> 17:01.112
I'll think of a mermaid lagoon,

17:02.605 --> 17:04.778
underneath a magic moon.

17:04.941 --> 17:07.035
I'll think I'm in a pirate's cave.

17:07.108 --> 17:09.487
I think I'll be an Indian brave.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.696
Now everybody try.

17:11.781 --> 17:14.375
One, two, three!

17:15.117 --> 17:18.496
We can fly! We can fly! We can fly!

17:26.127 --> 17:28.677
This won't do.
What's the matter with you?

17:29.090 --> 17:31.639
All it takes is faith and trust.

17:33.302 --> 17:36.146
And something I forgot. Dust!

17:36.305 --> 17:38.649
- Dust?
- Dust?

17:38.975 --> 17:40.397
Yep.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.480
Just a little bit of pixie dust.

17:49.569 --> 17:52.322
Now, think of the happiest things.

17:52.613 --> 17:56.413
- It's the same as having wings.
- Let's all try it just once more.

17:56.492 --> 17:58.290
Look! We're rising off the floor.

17:58.828 --> 18:02.253
- Jiminyl
- Oh, my! We can fly!

18:02.331 --> 18:03.423
You can fly!

18:03.499 --> 18:05.672
We can fly!

18:06.877 --> 18:10.802
Come on, everybody. Here we go!

18:11.507 --> 18:13.350
Off to Never Land!

18:19.056 --> 18:21.935
<i>Think of a wonderful thought</i>

18:22.018 --> 18:24.771
<i>Any merry little thought</i>

18:24.854 --> 18:27.073
<i>Think of Christmas
Think of snow</i>

18:27.148 --> 18:31.369
<i>Think of sleigh bells
Off you go like reindeer in the sky</i>

18:32.028 --> 18:36.283
<i>You can fly, you can fly
You can fly</i>

18:36.616 --> 18:39.460
<i>Think of the happiest things</i>

18:39.535 --> 18:42.254
<i>It's the same as having wings</i>

18:42.330 --> 18:44.583
<i>Take the path that moonbeams make</i>

18:44.665 --> 18:49.967
<i>If the moon is still awake
you'll see him wink his eye</i>

18:50.046 --> 18:53.926
<i>You can fly, you can fly
You can fly</i>

18:55.217 --> 18:57.311
<i>Up you go with a heigh and ho</i>

18:57.386 --> 18:59.605
<i>To the stars beyond the blue</i>

18:59.764 --> 19:03.564
<i>There's a Never Land waiting for you</i>

19:03.643 --> 19:08.274
<i>Where all your
happy dreams come true</i>

19:08.356 --> 19:13.863
<i>Every dream that you dream
will come true</i>

19:13.944 --> 19:15.946
Come on, Nana!

19:16.030 --> 19:19.660
<i>When there's a smile in your heart</i>

19:19.909 --> 19:25.257
<i>There's no better time to start</i>

19:25.331 --> 19:27.584
<i>Think of all the joy you'll find</i>

19:27.667 --> 19:32.343
<i>When you leave the world behind
and bid your cares goodbye</i>

19:32.421 --> 19:36.016
<i>You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly</i>

19:36.092 --> 19:38.470
<i>You can fly</i>

19:48.104 --> 19:51.779
There it is, Wendy. Second star
to the right and straight on till morning.

19:54.443 --> 19:57.617
<i>When there's
a smile in your heart</i>

19:57.738 --> 20:01.618
<i>There's no better time to start</i>

20:04.036 --> 20:08.132
<i>Think of all the joy you'll find
when you leave the world behind</i>

20:08.207 --> 20:11.677
<i>And bid your cares goodbye</i>

20:11.752 --> 20:15.302
<i>You can fly, you can fly
You can fly, you can fly, you can fly</i>

20:15.381 --> 20:19.306
<i>You can fly, you can fly, you can fly</i>

20:33.816 --> 20:38.071
<i>Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life</i>

20:38.154 --> 20:42.079
<i>A-rovin' over the sea
Give me a career as a buccaneer</i>

20:42.158 --> 20:45.412
<i>It's the life of a pirate for me, oh</i>

20:45.494 --> 20:48.043
<i>The life of a pirate for me</i>

20:49.498 --> 20:55.096
<i>Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life
They never bury your bones</i>

20:55.254 --> 20:58.975
<i>For when it's all over a jolly sea rover
drops in on his friend, Davy Jones</i>

20:59.049 --> 21:03.350
<i>Oh, my good friend, Davy Jones</i>

21:03.637 --> 21:08.234
- Good morning, shipmates.
- And what's good about it, Mr Smee?

21:08.976 --> 21:13.152
Here we are, collecting barnacles
on this miserable island.

21:13.230 --> 21:17.531
While his nibs plays
ring-around-the-rosy with Peter Pan.

21:17.610 --> 21:18.953
Look out. It might go off.

21:19.028 --> 21:22.453
We ought to be tending
to the business of looting ships.

21:22.531 --> 21:26.502
Why, I've almost forgotten
how to slit a throat.

21:27.203 --> 21:28.625
Better hop it.

21:28.704 --> 21:33.175
And tell the captain
we wants to put to sea, see?

21:37.046 --> 21:38.969
Peter Pan...

21:41.634 --> 21:44.558
Blast that Peter Pan!

21:45.012 --> 21:48.937
If I could only find his hideout,
I'd trap him in his lair.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.984
But where is it?

21:51.435 --> 21:53.108
Mermaid Lagoon?

21:54.230 --> 21:56.232
No, we've searched that.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.865
We've combed Cannibal Cove.

22:00.653 --> 22:02.200
Here!

22:02.279 --> 22:06.375
No. No, no, no! That's Indian terri...

22:07.243 --> 22:09.166
But wait.

22:09.495 --> 22:13.921
Those redskins know this island
better than I do me own ship.

22:16.293 --> 22:18.387
I wonder.

22:19.255 --> 22:21.929
- Good morning, captain.
- I've got it!

22:22.007 --> 22:23.759
Tiger Lily, Smee!

22:24.635 --> 22:26.262
Tiger Lily, captain?

22:26.345 --> 22:30.270
The chief's daughter.
She'll know where Pan is hiding.

22:30.683 --> 22:33.402
But will she talk, captain?

22:34.228 --> 22:37.903
A little persuasion might be in order.

22:37.982 --> 22:40.155
Now let me see.

22:40.234 --> 22:42.487
Boiling in oil?

22:43.320 --> 22:47.200
Keelhauling? Marooning?

22:47.783 --> 22:51.913
<i>A pirate's life is a wonderful life</i>

22:51.996 --> 22:56.217
<i>You'll find adventure and sport</i>

22:56.292 --> 22:59.967
<i>But live every minute
for all that is in it</i>

23:00.045 --> 23:05.643
<i>The life of a pirate is short</i>

23:05.718 --> 23:10.064
<i>Oh, the life...</i>

23:17.062 --> 23:18.735
Now let me see, where was I?

23:18.814 --> 23:21.112
Oh, dear, dear, dear Captain Hook.

23:21.191 --> 23:23.865
Shooting a man
in the middle of his cadenza?

23:24.528 --> 23:26.997
It ain't good form, you know.

23:27.072 --> 23:29.541
"Good form," Mr Smee?

23:29.825 --> 23:31.418
Blast good form!

23:31.493 --> 23:35.418
Did Pan show good form
when he did this to me?

23:35.497 --> 23:40.128
Why, captain, cutting your hand off was
only a childish prank, you might say.

23:40.210 --> 23:43.339
Aye! But throwing it to the crocodile!

23:43.505 --> 23:46.509
That cursed beast liked
the taste of me so well,

23:46.592 --> 23:50.096
he's followed me ever since,
licking his chops

23:50.179 --> 23:52.898
for the rest of me.

23:52.973 --> 23:55.351
And he'd have had you by now, captain,

23:55.434 --> 23:57.778
if he hadn't swallowed that alarm clock.

23:57.853 --> 24:01.107
But now when he's about,
he warns ya, as ya might say,

24:01.190 --> 24:04.694
with his tick-took, tick-took, tick-took

24:34.515 --> 24:37.894
Smee? Smee!

24:37.977 --> 24:40.321
Save me, Smee!
Please, don't let him get me, Smee!

24:40.396 --> 24:43.275
Please, don't let him get me, Smee!
Smee!

24:43.899 --> 24:47.244
Here now, shame on ya.
Upsettin' the poor captain.

24:47.319 --> 24:50.038
There'll be no handouts today.
Shoo now, shoo!

24:50.114 --> 24:53.664
Go on, go on, off it. Off with ya,
I say, go away, go away, out of here.

24:58.080 --> 25:01.550
- Is he gone, Smee?
- Aye, captain, all clear.

25:01.625 --> 25:04.504
- Nothin' to worry about.
- Oh, Smee, Smee.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.930
I can't stand it any longer.
I tell you, I can't.

25:07.006 --> 25:10.055
Now, now, now, now, captain.
Just relax.

25:10.926 --> 25:13.054
What you need is a shave.

25:13.137 --> 25:17.392
A nice, soothing shave. There now.

25:18.225 --> 25:21.604
<i>Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life</i>

25:21.687 --> 25:25.191
<i>A-sailing over the sea
Give me a career as</i> a...

25:25.274 --> 25:27.823
Captain, you know, I can't help noticin'

25:27.901 --> 25:31.280
you just ain't been
your usual jolly self of late.

25:32.573 --> 25:34.325
<i>Give me a career as a buccaneer</i>

25:34.408 --> 25:37.207
The crew's gettin'
a might uneasy, captain.

25:37.286 --> 25:39.505
That is, what's left of it.

25:42.666 --> 25:46.296
Now, why don't we put to sea, see?
Leave Never Land.

25:46.378 --> 25:49.348
Forget Peter Pan. There now!

25:50.549 --> 25:52.722
<i>Give me a career as a buccaneer</i>

25:52.801 --> 25:56.772
We'd all be a lot happier,
not to mention a lot healthier.

26:01.310 --> 26:05.565
Captain? Oh, dear!
I never shaved him this close before.

26:09.777 --> 26:13.122
Now, don't worry, captain.
It must be somewhere about.

26:14.948 --> 26:16.700
Get up, you idiot!

26:17.034 --> 26:19.583
Aye, aye, sir.

26:21.914 --> 26:24.588
I found it, captain. Good as new.

26:25.125 --> 26:27.423
Why, you blithering blockhead!

26:27.503 --> 26:31.599
- Peter Pan ahoy!
- What? What? Where away?

26:31.840 --> 26:34.844
Three points off the starboard bow!

26:35.427 --> 26:37.725
Swoggle me eyes! It is Pan!

26:37.805 --> 26:40.900
Headed this way
with some more of those scurvy brats!

26:40.974 --> 26:43.193
Mr Smee, pipe up the crew!

26:43.268 --> 26:46.192
Aye, aye, sir. Pipe up the crew.

26:46.271 --> 26:47.864
All hands on deck!

26:48.524 --> 26:49.867
All hands on deck!

26:51.193 --> 26:52.695
All hands on deck!

26:55.197 --> 26:56.540
All hands on deck!

26:59.660 --> 27:02.163
Look alive, you swabs!

27:02.538 --> 27:05.963
- We've got him this time, Mr Smee.
- That we have, captain.

27:06.041 --> 27:08.669
Man the Long Tom, you bilge rats!

27:10.379 --> 27:13.804
- I've waited years for this.
- Not countin' holidays either.

27:13.882 --> 27:17.887
- Double the powder, shorten the fuse!
- Shorten the powder, double the fuse!

27:17.970 --> 27:22.225
A pretty sight, Mr Smee.
We'll pot 'em like sitting ducks.

27:22.432 --> 27:26.778
- All right, men! Range 42.
- Range 42.

27:26.854 --> 27:30.199
- Elevation 65.
- Elevation 65.

27:30.274 --> 27:32.948
- Three degrees west.
- Three degrees west.

27:33.026 --> 27:34.699
Steady now!

27:34.778 --> 27:37.406
Steady!

27:39.241 --> 27:42.586
Peter, it's just as
I've always dreamed it would be.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.834
Look, John, there's Mermaid Lagoon.

27:44.913 --> 27:49.419
By Jove! And the Indian encampment!

27:50.627 --> 27:52.971
Look, there's Captain Hook
and the pirates.

27:56.091 --> 27:57.718
Look out!

28:00.095 --> 28:02.473
Take Wendy and the boys to the island.

28:02.764 --> 28:05.688
I'll stay here and draw Hook's fire.

28:07.311 --> 28:11.407
Hook! Hook! You codfish! Here!

28:16.987 --> 28:21.868
Tinker Bell? Not so fast.
Please, Tinker Bell.

28:22.492 --> 28:25.120
We can't keep up with you.

28:25.579 --> 28:28.549
Tinker Bell! Wait!

28:54.775 --> 28:56.072
$0!

28:59.071 --> 29:00.744
- Who ya shovin'?
- Who ya shovin'?

29:00.822 --> 29:03.166
- You! That's who!
- I'll show you!

29:11.250 --> 29:13.002
Orders from Pan?

29:13.085 --> 29:16.464
- Hold it, men!
- What's the orders, Tink?

29:18.090 --> 29:20.434
- A terrible what?
- Wendy Bird.

29:20.509 --> 29:21.681
Wendy Bird?

29:22.469 --> 29:24.221
Flying this way?

29:24.304 --> 29:26.523
Pan's orders are... What?

29:27.557 --> 29:28.774
- Smash it?
- Kick it?

29:28.850 --> 29:30.523
- Stomp it?
- Stomp it?

29:33.313 --> 29:35.236
- Shoot it down!
- Shoot it down!

29:35.315 --> 29:38.034
- Yeah, shoot it down!
- Come on, follow Tink!

29:38.110 --> 29:41.205
- Yeah, come on. Let's go then!
- We're gonna get 'er!

29:58.255 --> 30:00.428
- I see it!
- Me too!

30:01.008 --> 30:03.807
Ready, aim...

30:04.886 --> 30:06.229
Fire!

30:19.026 --> 30:21.950
Peter, you saved my life.

30:24.698 --> 30:27.793
- Are you hurted, Wendy?
- No, Michael.

30:28.035 --> 30:30.834
Good heavens, Wendy,
you might have been killed.

30:30.912 --> 30:34.633
- Hey! Hey! Pan!
- We followed your orders, Pan!

30:37.711 --> 30:41.432
- Pan, I got it with my skull buster!
- Ya did not! We did!

30:41.506 --> 30:44.726
- I did it, Pan! I did it!
- No, I did!

30:46.553 --> 30:48.100
Attention!

30:49.264 --> 30:51.892
Well, I'm certainly proud of you.

30:52.351 --> 30:53.944
You blockheads!

30:54.895 --> 30:57.444
- I bring ya a mother to tell stories...
- A mother?

30:58.940 --> 31:03.161
- And you shoot her down.
- Well, Tink said it was a bird!

31:03.612 --> 31:05.159
Tink said what?

31:05.238 --> 31:08.082
Well, she said you said
to shoot it down!

31:08.158 --> 31:10.957
Tinker Bell. Tink!

31:12.662 --> 31:14.255
Come here.

31:14.581 --> 31:16.834
You're charged with high treason, Tink.

31:17.542 --> 31:19.590
Are you guilty or not guilty?

31:21.505 --> 31:25.055
Guilty? But don't ya know
ya might have killed her?

31:27.469 --> 31:29.096
Tinker Bell!

31:30.055 --> 31:32.558
I hereby banish you forever.

31:34.643 --> 31:36.816
Please, not forever.

31:37.104 --> 31:39.072
Well, for a week then.

31:39.147 --> 31:40.865
Come on, Wendy,
I'll show you the island.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.740
Peter, the mermaids?

31:43.819 --> 31:46.698
- Let's go huntin'!
- Tigers?

31:46.780 --> 31:48.498
- Naw, bears.
- Naw, bears.

31:48.990 --> 31:51.243
Personally,
I prefer to see the aborigines.

31:51.326 --> 31:52.828
And the Indians too.

31:53.620 --> 31:55.839
All right, men!
Go out and capture a few Indians.

31:57.541 --> 32:01.512
- John, you be the leader.
- I shall try to be worthy of my post.

32:01.586 --> 32:03.384
Forward! March!

32:06.091 --> 32:07.593
Come on, bear.

32:08.009 --> 32:09.932
Michael, do be careful.

32:10.011 --> 32:12.514
Come on, Wendy.
I'll show you the mermaids.

32:19.062 --> 32:22.487
<i>Following the leader
The leader, the leader</i>

32:22.566 --> 32:26.161
<i>We're following the leader

32:26.236 --> 32:29.581
<i>Tee dum, tee dee

32:29.656 --> 32:33.456
<i>Tee dum, tee dee
It's part of the game we play</i>

32:33.535 --> 32:36.789
<i>Tee dum, tee dee
The words are easy to say</i>

32:36.872 --> 32:40.593
<i>Just a teedle ee dum

32:40.876 --> 32:44.346
<i>Tee dum, tee dee

32:44.421 --> 32:47.925
<i>We're one for all

32:48.008 --> 32:51.478

<i>Oh, a teedle ee dum

33:42.771 --> 33:44.148
Indians!

33:46.107 --> 33:47.450
Blackfoot tribe.

33:48.985 --> 33:51.613
Belongs to the Algonquin group.

33:52.072 --> 33:54.416
- Quite savage, you know.
- Let's go get 'em.

33:54.491 --> 33:58.121
- Come on! We'll get 'em!
- Gentlemen, gentlemen.

33:59.871 --> 34:01.418
- First, we must plan our strategy.
- What's stragety?

34:01.498 --> 34:02.750
A plan of attack.

34:02.832 --> 34:06.757
The initial phase
is an encircling manoeuvre, thus!

34:34.406 --> 34:36.875
John! Indians! Indians!

34:38.827 --> 34:40.295
Let me in!

34:43.998 --> 34:46.342
Remember, the Indian is cunning...

34:46.418 --> 34:48.216
- Hey...
-...but not intelligent.

34:48.295 --> 34:52.141
Therefore, we simply surround them
and take them by surprise.

35:23.747 --> 35:27.342
I'm frightfully sorry, old chaps.
It's all my fault.

35:27.417 --> 35:31.467
- That's all right, Wildcat.
- We don't mind.

35:31.546 --> 35:33.219
That's okay.

35:37.552 --> 35:38.849
<i>How.</i>

35:38.928 --> 35:40.601
- How, chief!
- How.

35:40.680 --> 35:44.901
For many moons red man
fight paleface Lost Boys.

35:46.728 --> 35:48.776
Sometime you win.

35:48.980 --> 35:50.323
Sometime we win.

35:50.398 --> 35:54.778
Okay, chief. You win this time.
Now turn us loose.

35:54.861 --> 35:58.331
"Turn us loose?"
You mean this is only a game?

35:58.406 --> 36:00.659
Sure! When we win,
we turn them loose.

36:00.742 --> 36:02.744
When they win, they turn us loose.

36:02.827 --> 36:05.376
This time, no turn 'em loose.

36:07.415 --> 36:10.885
- The chief's a great spoof er.
- Me no spoof 'em.

36:11.378 --> 36:13.631
Where you hide Princess Tiger Lily?

36:14.422 --> 36:15.514
Tiger Lily?

36:15.590 --> 36:18.514
- We ain't got your old princess.
- I've never seen her.

36:18.593 --> 36:20.345
- Me neither.
- Honest, we don't.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.271
Heap big lie.

36:22.806 --> 36:25.901
If Tiger Lily not back by sunset,

36:26.810 --> 36:29.780
burn 'em at stake.

36:49.124 --> 36:52.879
Just imagine, real live mermaids.

36:53.002 --> 36:56.051
- Would you like to meet 'em?
- Peter, I'd love to.

36:56.131 --> 36:58.133
All right, come on.

37:00.218 --> 37:04.394
- It's Peter.
- Hello, Peter!

37:04.472 --> 37:05.598
Hello, Peter!

37:06.766 --> 37:08.518
Hello, Peter!

37:12.021 --> 37:13.398
Hello, girls.

37:13.481 --> 37:15.324
I'm so glad to see you.

37:15.400 --> 37:19.997
Why did you stay away so long?
Did you miss me?

37:20.071 --> 37:23.041
- Tell us one of your adventures.
- Something exciting.

37:23.116 --> 37:26.586
Want to hear about the time
I cut off Hook's hand?

37:26.661 --> 37:30.131
- I've always liked that one.
- Me too.

37:30.206 --> 37:32.959
There I was on
Marooner's Rock surrounded...

37:33.042 --> 37:35.761
- Peter!
- Who's she?

37:36.963 --> 37:39.011
Her? Oh, that's Wendy.

37:39.382 --> 37:41.601
- A girl?
- What's she doing here?

37:42.010 --> 37:44.138
And in her nightdress too.

37:44.596 --> 37:47.600
Come on, dearie. Join us for a swim.

37:47.682 --> 37:49.684
- I'm not dressed for it.
- But you must!

37:49.768 --> 37:51.520
- We insist!
- No, please!

37:51.603 --> 37:54.982
- Too good for us?
- Peter!

38:02.280 --> 38:06.080
- If you dare to come near me again...
- Wendy! Wendy!

38:06.159 --> 38:08.878
They were just having
a little fun, weren't you?

38:09.537 --> 38:13.258
- That's all.
- We were only trying to drown her.

38:13.625 --> 38:16.299
- Ya see?
- Well, if you think for one minute

38:16.377 --> 38:18.345
that I'm going to put up with a...

38:18.421 --> 38:19.422
Hold it, Wendy.

38:25.386 --> 38:26.558
Yep, it's Hook.

38:26.638 --> 38:28.936
- Hook!
- Hook!

38:31.309 --> 38:32.731
Quick, Wendy.

38:36.397 --> 38:38.024
They've captured Tiger Lily.

38:52.288 --> 38:56.043
Looks like they're headin'
for Skull Rock. Come on, Wendy.

38:56.125 --> 38:57.752
Let's see what they're up to.

39:12.308 --> 39:16.404
Now, me dear princess,
this is me proposition.

39:16.479 --> 39:20.859
You tell me the hiding place
of Peter Pan,

39:20.942 --> 39:22.819
and I shall set you free.

39:23.236 --> 39:25.785
- You dog.
- Poor Tiger Lily.

39:26.281 --> 39:28.955
Am I not a man of me word, Mr Smee?

39:29.033 --> 39:32.333
Oh, yes. Always, captain.

39:32.787 --> 39:36.963
You'd better talk, me dear,
for soon the tide will be in

39:37.041 --> 39:38.918
and then it will be too late.

39:39.002 --> 39:42.723
I'll show the old codfish.
Stay here, and watch the fun.

39:42.922 --> 39:44.014
Fun?

39:44.549 --> 39:45.926
Remember,

39:46.009 --> 39:49.263
there is no path through water

39:49.345 --> 39:51.973
to the happy hunting ground.

39:53.641 --> 39:56.394
This is your last chance, Tiger Lily!

39:57.020 --> 40:01.526
Manatoa, great spirit
of mighty seawater, speak!

40:03.192 --> 40:05.570
Beware, Captain Hook!

40:05.653 --> 40:08.247
Beware! Beware!

40:08.323 --> 40:12.169
- Did you hear that, Smee?
- It's an evil spirit, captain.

40:12.577 --> 40:15.956
Stand by, Smee,
while I take a look around.

40:16.581 --> 40:19.676
Spirit of the great seawater, is it?

40:34.432 --> 40:36.901
Wendy. Watch this.

40:39.437 --> 40:41.030
Mr Smee!

40:41.522 --> 40:42.944
Yes, captain?

40:43.024 --> 40:48.281
Release the princess
and take her back to her people.

40:48.821 --> 40:51.870
Aye, aye, sir. Release the princess...

40:52.700 --> 40:54.122
But, captain...

40:54.202 --> 40:57.627
Those are me orders, Mr Smee!

40:58.498 --> 40:59.875
Aye, aye, sir.

41:03.503 --> 41:06.848
- Captain Hook's comin' to his senses.
- Odd's fish!

41:07.090 --> 41:10.060
I told him you Indians
wouldn't betray Peter Pan.

41:10.134 --> 41:14.685
And just what do you think
you are doing, Mr Smee?

41:15.515 --> 41:18.860
Just what you told me, captain.
Carryin' out your orders.

41:19.519 --> 41:21.192
My orders?

41:21.270 --> 41:23.693
Yes, captain. Didn't you just say to go...

41:23.773 --> 41:27.277
Put her back! You blithering idiot!

41:27.735 --> 41:30.579
My orders. Of all the bumbling...

41:30.655 --> 41:32.783
Mr Smee!

41:33.241 --> 41:36.370
Just exactly what do you
think you are doing?

41:36.828 --> 41:39.081
Putting her back like you said, captain.

41:39.163 --> 41:41.507
I said nothing of the sort!

41:41.582 --> 41:44.335
But, captain, didn't you? I thought that...

41:44.419 --> 41:46.513
For the last time, Mr Smee.

41:47.130 --> 41:50.680
Take the princess back to her people.

41:51.259 --> 41:54.183
Understand?

41:56.222 --> 41:57.565
Aye, aye, sir.

41:58.141 --> 41:59.859
And one more thing.

41:59.934 --> 42:03.108
When you return to the ship,
tell the whole crew

42:03.187 --> 42:05.940
to help themselves to me best rum.

42:07.608 --> 42:08.700
Peter!

42:08.776 --> 42:11.575
Here's your spirit, Smee!

42:12.572 --> 42:14.745
Why, it's Peter Pan.

42:17.660 --> 42:20.038
- Scurvy brat!
- Thank you, captain.

42:20.121 --> 42:23.796
Come down, boy,
if you've a taste for cold steel.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.627
Watch this, Wendy.

42:25.710 --> 42:27.337
Oh, Peter, do be careful.

42:40.725 --> 42:43.604
- Try your luck, Mr Smee?
- Let him have it!

42:44.979 --> 42:47.949
Well, come on, you idiot! Blast him!

42:48.649 --> 42:50.242
Right here, Mr Smee.

42:51.277 --> 42:54.451
Hold it, you fool! No! No!

42:58.076 --> 42:59.544
Captain?

43:01.454 --> 43:02.706
How dreadful.

43:03.164 --> 43:07.761
What a pity, Mr Smee.
I'm afraid we've lost the dear captain.

43:11.089 --> 43:12.557
Captain!

43:13.341 --> 43:14.467
In the back, captain?

43:21.891 --> 43:23.518
Give it to him, captain!

43:23.601 --> 43:25.399
Cleave him to the brisket!

43:38.199 --> 43:41.920
I've got you this time, Pan.

43:46.332 --> 43:50.178
Well, well, a codfish on a hook.

43:50.253 --> 43:54.724
I'll get you for this, Pan,
if it's the last thing I do!

43:56.759 --> 43:59.638
I say, captain, do you hear something?

44:00.221 --> 44:01.518
No.

44:02.723 --> 44:04.066
No!

44:09.021 --> 44:10.568
No!

44:12.483 --> 44:15.908
Mr Crocodile, do you like codfish?

44:16.028 --> 44:18.247
- You do?
- Oh, Peter, no!

44:26.497 --> 44:27.589
No!

44:29.959 --> 44:32.883
- Smee!
- Don't go away, captain!

44:32.962 --> 44:36.182
Stay right there now, sir. I'll save ya, sir.

44:38.968 --> 44:40.094
Smee!

44:41.804 --> 44:43.602
Smee!

44:48.936 --> 44:50.279
Smee!

44:59.572 --> 45:01.495
Captain! Captain!

45:01.908 --> 45:04.582
Smee! Smee!

45:05.620 --> 45:08.214
- Give him back!
- Smee...

45:09.832 --> 45:14.178
Row for the ship! Row for the ship...

45:22.386 --> 45:24.184
Smee!

45:27.308 --> 45:30.232
Peter, what about Tiger Lily?

45:30.561 --> 45:32.859
Tiger Lily? Oh, Tiger Lily.

45:35.149 --> 45:36.446
Help...

45:43.741 --> 45:46.460
Peter. Wait for me.

46:17.608 --> 46:20.202
That cursed Peter Pan.

46:22.655 --> 46:24.657
Making a fool out of me.

46:31.789 --> 46:34.713
Oh, my head.

46:40.298 --> 46:43.768
<i>Oh, a pirate's life is a wonderful life</i>

46:43.843 --> 46:46.221
Your hot water, Mr Smee.

46:46.554 --> 46:49.524
The poor captain
has a splitting headache.

46:49.598 --> 46:51.316
We mustn't annoy him.

47:09.910 --> 47:14.211
Well, captain, it's nice
to see you smiling again.

47:14.707 --> 47:19.178
Brings back the good old days when
we was leadin' a healthy, normal life.

47:19.253 --> 47:21.597
Scuttlin' ships, cuttin' throats.

47:21.714 --> 47:24.888
Captain, why don't we put to sea again?

47:25.176 --> 47:28.430
You know, there's trouble
brewin' on the island.

47:28.888 --> 47:30.390
Women trouble.

47:30.473 --> 47:33.147
I wouldn't want this to go any farther,

47:33.225 --> 47:37.480
but the cook told me
that the first mate told him

47:38.022 --> 47:42.243
that he heard that Pan
has banished Tinker Bell.

47:45.404 --> 47:48.203
Why, you doddering imbecile, I...

47:48.449 --> 47:53.546
Did you say Pan
has banished Tinker Bell?

47:53.621 --> 47:55.498
Aye, aye, captain. He has.

47:55.581 --> 47:58.255
- But why?
- Well, on account of Wendy, captain

47:58.334 --> 48:02.384
Tink tried to do her in, she did.
Tink's terrible jealous.

48:02.546 --> 48:06.847
- Well, well.
- That's why we ought to leave, captain.

48:06.926 --> 48:10.180
This ain't no place
for a respectable pirate.

48:10.262 --> 48:12.640
That's it, Smee! That's it!

48:13.307 --> 48:14.900
I'm glad you agrees, captain.

48:14.975 --> 48:17.899
Quick, me coat. Me best dress coat.

48:17.978 --> 48:20.606
Aye, aye, sir.
The sooner we get going, the better.

48:21.190 --> 48:24.160
Yes, a jealous female
can be tricked into anything

48:25.111 --> 48:26.988
- My case of hooks!
- Aye, aye, sir.

48:28.030 --> 48:30.408
Here you are, sir. Your Sunday set.

48:30.491 --> 48:34.166
If we impress the pixie, convince her
we're eager to help her,

48:34.245 --> 48:36.418
the wench may chart our course

48:36.497 --> 48:40.377
to a certain hiding place.

48:40.459 --> 48:44.180
Our best hiding place is the Spanish
main, sir. I'll set our course...

48:45.339 --> 48:49.845
And where do you think you are going?

48:50.386 --> 48:53.265
To tell the boys
we sails with the tide, sir.

48:53.347 --> 48:58.103
You will go ashore, pick up Tinker Bell

48:58.561 --> 49:00.905
and bring her to me.

49:02.773 --> 49:05.196
Understand?

49:05.401 --> 49:06.744
Aye, aye, sir.

49:18.038 --> 49:20.962
<i>- How.
- How.</i>

49:23.294 --> 49:25.012
What's the chief doing, John?

49:25.087 --> 49:28.682
He's delivering an oration
in sign language.

49:30.050 --> 49:31.302
What's he saying?

49:31.385 --> 49:35.891
He says, "Peter Pan, mighty warrior.

49:36.765 --> 49:38.859
"Save Tiger Lily.

49:38.934 --> 49:42.564
"Make big chief heap glad."

49:42.771 --> 49:45.741
Well, he certainly
doesn't look "heap glad."

49:46.317 --> 49:49.696
Make Peter Pan heap big chief.

49:50.237 --> 49:52.911
You now Little Flying Eagle.

49:55.576 --> 49:57.499
Flying Eagle! Flying Eagle!

49:57.578 --> 49:59.251
Hurray!

50:00.331 --> 50:03.835
- How wonderful!
- Hurray!

50:14.595 --> 50:18.395
Teach 'em paleface brother
all about red man.

50:19.225 --> 50:21.569
Good, this should be most enlightening.

50:21.644 --> 50:24.193
Hey, what makes the red man red?

50:24.271 --> 50:26.490
When did he first say, "Ugh?"

50:26.565 --> 50:28.818
Why does he ask you, "How?"

50:29.360 --> 50:32.113
"Why does he ask you, 'How'?"

50:33.572 --> 50:36.951
<i>Why does he ask you, "How?"</i>

50:37.701 --> 50:41.376
<i>Once the Injun didn't know all
the things that he know now</i>

50:41.455 --> 50:43.378
<i>But the Injun he sure learn a lot</i>

50:43.457 --> 50:45.459
<i>And it's all from asking how</i>

50:48.796 --> 50:50.719
<i>We translate for you</i>

50:50.798 --> 50:54.848
<i>Hana means what mana means
and ganda means that too</i>

51:02.560 --> 51:04.813
Squaw, no dance.

51:05.312 --> 51:07.440
Squaw, get 'em firewood.

51:11.735 --> 51:14.614
<i>When did he first say, "Ugh?"</i>

51:15.948 --> 51:18.997
<i>When did he first say, "Ugh?"</i>

51:20.077 --> 51:24.082
<i>In the Injun book, it say
when first brave married squaw</i>

51:24.248 --> 51:28.344
<i>He gave outwith heap big "ugh"
when he saw his mother-in-law</i>

51:35.342 --> 51:43.523
<i>What made the red man red?</i>

51:43.726 --> 51:47.447
<i>Let's go back a million years
to the very first Injun prince</i>

51:47.521 --> 51:51.571
<i>He kissed a maid and start to blush
and we've all been blushin' since</i>

51:53.861 --> 51:55.659
<i>Now you've got it right
from the head man</i>

51:55.738 --> 51:57.706
<i>The real true story of the red man</i>

51:57.781 --> 52:02.036
<i>No matter what's been written or said</i>

52:02.119 --> 52:08.126
<i>Now you know why the red man's red</i>

52:21.722 --> 52:23.099
John!

52:23.182 --> 52:25.560
Squaw take 'em papoose.

52:27.394 --> 52:30.898
- Michael!
- Squaw, get 'em firewood.

52:31.649 --> 52:34.072
Squaw no get 'em firewood!

52:34.151 --> 52:36.404
Squaw go home.

52:46.580 --> 52:48.708
Beggin' your pardon, Miss Bell,

52:48.791 --> 52:51.544
but Captain Hook
would like a word with ya.

53:05.599 --> 53:09.274
Yes, Miss Bell,
Captain Hook admits defeat.

53:11.063 --> 53:15.785
Tomorrow I leave the island,
never to return.

53:15.859 --> 53:19.159
I'm glad to hear that, captain.
I'll tell the crew and...

53:24.451 --> 53:26.920
And that's why I asked
you over, me dear,

53:26.995 --> 53:30.545
to tell Peter I bear him no ill will.

53:33.168 --> 53:36.092
Pan has his faults, to be sure.

53:37.214 --> 53:40.013
Bringing that Wendy
to the island, for instance.

53:40.092 --> 53:42.390
Dangerous business, that.

53:45.305 --> 53:47.854
Why, rumour has it that already

53:47.933 --> 53:50.937
she has come between you and Peter.

53:55.357 --> 53:57.075
But what's this?

53:57.568 --> 53:59.161
Tears?

53:59.236 --> 54:01.330
Then it is true.

54:01.822 --> 54:06.202
Smee. The way of a man with a maid.

54:06.702 --> 54:10.752
Taking the best years
of her life and then

54:11.623 --> 54:14.172
casting her aside

54:14.626 --> 54:16.128
like an old glove!

54:16.211 --> 54:19.135
Ain't it a bloomin' shame?

54:19.214 --> 54:22.684
But we mustn't judge
Peter too harshly, me dear

54:23.510 --> 54:26.480
It's that Wendy who's to blame.

54:27.264 --> 54:30.859
Mr Smee, we must
save the lad from himself.

54:31.477 --> 54:32.899
But how?

54:34.021 --> 54:37.321
We've so little time.
We sail in the morning.

54:37.816 --> 54:40.740
Sail! That's it, Smee!

54:43.030 --> 54:44.748
We'll shanghai Wendy.

54:44.823 --> 54:46.996
"Shanghai Wendy," captain?

54:47.326 --> 54:48.873
Take her to sea with us.

54:48.952 --> 54:52.832
With her gone, Peter will soon
forget this mad infatuation.

54:52.915 --> 54:55.384
Come, Smee,
we must leave immediately.

54:55.459 --> 54:56.585
Surround Peter's home...

54:56.668 --> 54:58.636
But, captain, we...

54:58.712 --> 55:01.181
We don't know where Peter Pan lives!

55:02.132 --> 55:04.635
Great Scott, you're right, Smee!

55:06.303 --> 55:07.646
What's that, my dear?

55:09.765 --> 55:13.986
You could show us the way?
Why, I never thought of that.

55:14.645 --> 55:17.489
- Take this down, Smee.
-"Take this down, Smee."

55:17.898 --> 55:19.696
Aye, aye, captain.

55:26.240 --> 55:29.369
- Start at Pegleg Point.
-"Start at Pegleg Point."

55:31.078 --> 55:33.251
Forty paces west of Blindman's Bluff.

55:33.330 --> 55:34.547
"Blindman's Bluff."

55:34.915 --> 55:36.838
Yes, yes.

55:36.917 --> 55:39.887
Hop, skip and a jump
across Crocodile Creek

55:39.962 --> 55:44.263
Then... Nor' by nor'east, one, two, three.

55:44.925 --> 55:48.771
Well, get on with it... Continue, my dear.

55:51.473 --> 55:54.477
I mustn't harm Peter?

55:54.768 --> 55:58.489
Madam, Captain Hook gives his word

55:58.564 --> 55:59.986
not to lay a finger

56:01.358 --> 56:04.157
or a hook on Peter Pan.

56:09.116 --> 56:11.164
Hangman's Tree.

56:11.243 --> 56:14.964
So that's the entrance
to his hiding place.

56:15.664 --> 56:19.544
Thank you, me dear.
You've been most helpful.

56:37.811 --> 56:40.155
<i>What makes red men red?</i>

56:51.283 --> 56:54.457
Big Chief Flying Eagle
greets his braves.

56:54.536 --> 56:55.628
<i>How.</i>

56:56.079 --> 56:57.956
- How, chief.
- How, chief, how!

56:58.040 --> 56:59.587
<i>- How.
- How.</i>

56:59.666 --> 57:01.964
Big chief greets little mother.

57:02.628 --> 57:03.880
<i>How.</i>

57:05.797 --> 57:08.425
Wendy, is that all you have to say?

57:08.508 --> 57:11.853
- Everyone else thinks I'm wonderful.
- Especially Tiger Lily.

57:11.929 --> 57:13.181
- Tiger Lily?
- John!

57:13.931 --> 57:17.526
Michael! Take off that war paint
and get ready for bed.

57:17.601 --> 57:20.400
- Bed?
- Brave no sleep.

57:20.479 --> 57:22.607
Go for days without sleep.

57:22.689 --> 57:24.942
- But we're going home in the morning.
- Home!

57:25.025 --> 57:28.245
- And...
- Wendy, we don't want to go home.

57:29.029 --> 57:33.375
No go home. Stay many moons.
Have heap big time.

57:33.617 --> 57:36.291
Peter, let's stop pretending
and be practical.

57:36.370 --> 57:39.123
Chief Flying Eagle has spoken.

57:39.998 --> 57:43.127
Oh, for goodness sake. Please, boys.

57:43.210 --> 57:46.885
Do you want to stay here
and grow up like savages?

57:46.964 --> 57:48.966
- Of course.
- But you can't.

57:49.049 --> 57:51.928
You need a mother. We all do.

57:52.636 --> 57:54.604
Aren't you our mother, Wendy?

57:54.680 --> 57:59.151
Michael, of course not! Surely,
you haven't forgotten our real mother!

57:59.226 --> 58:02.651
Did she have silky ears

58:02.813 --> 58:04.736
and wear a fur coat?

58:04.815 --> 58:08.115
Oh, no, Michael. That was Nana.

58:08.735 --> 58:10.578
I think I had a mother once.

58:10.654 --> 58:12.247
What was she like?

58:12.781 --> 58:13.873
I forget.

58:14.658 --> 58:17.502
- I had a white rat!
- That's no mother!

58:17.577 --> 58:18.920
Hey, who ya shovin'?

58:21.665 --> 58:26.341
No, no, boys! Please.
I'll tell you what a mother is.

58:26.420 --> 58:28.639
- Yeah, tell us.
- Please, Wendy.

58:29.047 --> 58:31.596
Well, a mother, a real mother,

58:32.259 --> 58:35.012
is the most wonderful person
in the world.

58:35.971 --> 58:38.645
She's the angel voice

58:39.766 --> 58:41.939
that bids you good night,

58:42.602 --> 58:44.275
kisses your cheek,

58:45.022 --> 58:47.650
whispers, "Sleep tight."

58:48.608 --> 58:51.828
<i>Your mother</i>

58:51.903 --> 58:55.328
<i>And mine</i>

58:55.699 --> 59:00.079
<i>Your mother</i>

59:00.162 --> 59:02.961
<i>And mine</i>

59:05.042 --> 59:10.424
<i>The helping hand
that guides you along</i>

59:11.131 --> 59:14.180
<i>Whether you're right</i>

59:14.301 --> 59:18.306
<i>Whether you're wrong</i>

59:18.388 --> 59:22.188
<i>Your mother</i>

59:22.267 --> 59:25.396
<i>And mine</i>

59:26.313 --> 59:31.444
<i>Your mother</i>

59:31.526 --> 59:34.325
<i>And mine</i>

59:36.114 --> 59:41.496
<i>What makes mothers
all that they are</i>

59:41.661 --> 59:44.414
<i>Might as well ask</i>

59:44.498 --> 59:48.969
<i>What makes a star</i>

59:51.088 --> 59:57.061
<i>Ask your heart to tell you her worth</i>

59:57.135 --> 01:00:00.309
<i>Your heart will say</i>

01:00:00.680 --> 01:00:05.060
<i>Heaven on earth</i>

01:00:05.143 --> 01:00:09.068
<i>Another word</i>

01:00:09.731 --> 01:00:14.032
<i>For divine</i>

01:00:14.653 --> 01:00:20.251
<i>Your mother</i>

01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:23.295
<i>And mine</i>

01:00:27.749 --> 01:00:30.719
I wanna see my mother.

01:00:31.169 --> 01:00:32.386
Yes, Michael.

01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:34.965
I propose we leave for home at once.

01:00:35.048 --> 01:00:37.392
- Could I go too, Wendy?
- Me too, Wendy!

01:00:38.176 --> 01:00:42.352
All right, boys. All right. I'm sure
Mother would be glad to have you.

01:00:43.098 --> 01:00:45.442
That is, if Peter doesn't mind.

01:00:45.517 --> 01:00:48.145
Go on! Go back and grow up.

01:00:48.562 --> 01:00:51.782
But I'm warning ya,
once you're grown up,

01:00:51.857 --> 01:00:53.234
you can never come back.

01:00:54.151 --> 01:00:55.368
Never!

01:00:56.361 --> 01:00:57.533
Oh, dear.

01:00:57.612 --> 01:01:01.116
- Well, then, shall we be off?
- Yeah, come on. Let's go!

01:01:01.199 --> 01:01:03.293
- Yeah!
- See ya, Peter.

01:01:05.328 --> 01:01:06.796
They'll be back.

01:01:12.252 --> 01:01:13.799
Peter.

01:01:17.048 --> 01:01:18.516
Good bye, Peter.

01:01:27.434 --> 01:01:29.528
All right, men. Take them away.

01:01:31.438 --> 01:01:34.612
And now, Smee, to take care

01:01:34.691 --> 01:01:37.194
of Master Peter Pan.

01:01:37.277 --> 01:01:42.829
But, captain, wouldn't it be
more humane-like to slit his throat?

01:01:42.908 --> 01:01:45.627
Aye, that it would, Mr Smee.

01:01:46.119 --> 01:01:49.794
But I have given me word
not to lay a finger...

01:01:49.873 --> 01:01:52.376
Or a hook on Peter Pan.

01:01:54.461 --> 01:01:59.012
And Captain Hook
never breaks a promise.

01:02:03.303 --> 01:02:05.476
<i>So try the life of a thief</i>

01:02:05.555 --> 01:02:07.557
<i>Just sample the life of a crook</i>

01:02:07.641 --> 01:02:09.609
<i>There isn't a boy who won't enjoy</i>

01:02:09.684 --> 01:02:12.608
<i>A-workin' for Captain Hook</i>

01:02:12.687 --> 01:02:15.531
<i>The world's most famous crook</i>

01:02:15.607 --> 01:02:18.577
<i>Crook, crook
Crickety crockety, crickety, crick</i>

01:02:18.652 --> 01:02:21.326
<i>The croc is after Captain...</i>

01:02:21.655 --> 01:02:23.749
<i>A special offer for today</i>

01:02:23.823 --> 01:02:25.746
<i>I'll tell you what I'll do</i>

01:02:25.825 --> 01:02:28.669
<i>All those who sign without delay</i>

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:31.214
<i>Will get a free tattoo</i>

01:02:31.498 --> 01:02:34.047
<i>Why, it's like money in the bank</i>

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:37.129
<i>Come on, join up and I'll be frank</i>

01:02:37.212 --> 01:02:41.262
<i>Unless you do, you'll walk the plank</i>

01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:45.562
<i>The choice is up to you</i>

01:02:49.391 --> 01:02:51.769
<i>You'll love the life of a thief</i>

01:02:51.851 --> 01:02:53.603
<i>You'll relish the life of a crook</i>

01:02:53.687 --> 01:02:55.860
<i>There's barrels of fun for everyone</i>

01:02:55.939 --> 01:02:59.239
<i>And you'll get treasures by the ton</i>

01:02:59.567 --> 01:03:03.572
<i>So come and sign the book</i>

01:03:03.655 --> 01:03:06.499
<i>Join up with Captain Hook</i>

01:03:06.574 --> 01:03:08.247
- Hey, l wanna join!
- Please! Oh, boy!

01:03:08.326 --> 01:03:11.170
- I wanna be a pirate!
- Oh, boy! A pirate!

01:03:12.205 --> 01:03:13.422
Boys!

01:03:15.375 --> 01:03:17.844
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?

01:03:17.919 --> 01:03:20.718
But Captain Hook
is most insistent, Wendy.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:23.892
Yeah! He says we'll walk
the plank if we don't.

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:27.517
Oh, no, we won't.
Peter Pan will save us.

01:03:27.595 --> 01:03:31.190
Peter Pan will save them, Smee.

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:35.229
Peter Pan will save them.

01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:38.698
Oh, captain, you did it.

01:03:39.399 --> 01:03:41.652
But a thousand pardons, my dear.

01:03:41.735 --> 01:03:45.035
I don't believe you are in
on our little joke.

01:03:45.238 --> 01:03:49.414
You see, we left a present for Peter.

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:52.245
Sort of a surprise package,
you might say.

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:55.879
Why, I can see our little friend
at this very moment,

01:03:55.957 --> 01:04:00.178
reading the tender inscription.

01:04:00.295 --> 01:04:04.766
"To Peter, with love from Wendy.

01:04:05.216 --> 01:04:08.265
"Do not open till 6:00."

01:04:10.638 --> 01:04:11.764
I wonder what's in it

01:04:11.848 --> 01:04:14.772
<i>Could he but see within the package,</i>

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:19.072
<i>he would find
an ingenious little device.</i>

01:04:19.564 --> 01:04:22.363
Set, so that when the clock is like this...

01:04:22.442 --> 01:04:25.742
Peter Pan will be blasted

01:04:25.945 --> 01:04:29.119
out of Never Land forever.

01:04:29.199 --> 01:04:30.200
No!

01:04:35.121 --> 01:04:36.964
But time grows short.

01:04:37.791 --> 01:04:40.965
We have but 18 seconds.

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:44.965
Fifteen seconds.

01:04:45.799 --> 01:04:48.052
Thirteen seconds.

01:04:48.468 --> 01:04:50.470
Twelve seconds.

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:52.396
Well, I guess I can open it now.

01:04:58.853 --> 01:05:01.402
Hey, Tink. Look what Wendy left.

01:05:01.481 --> 01:05:04.155
Hey, stop that! Stop it!
What's the matter with you?

01:05:05.110 --> 01:05:07.238
Hook? A bomb?

01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:08.822
Don't be ridiculous!

01:05:18.706 --> 01:05:21.801
And so passeth a worthy opponent.

01:05:22.168 --> 01:05:24.045
Amen.

01:05:28.174 --> 01:05:30.973
Hook! It was a bomb!

01:05:31.052 --> 01:05:35.023
Why, if it hadn't been for Tink...
Tinker Bell!

01:05:39.894 --> 01:05:42.693
Tink? Tinker Bell?

01:05:45.733 --> 01:05:47.360
Where are you, Tink?

01:05:47.861 --> 01:05:50.535
Tink? Tinker Bell!

01:05:58.163 --> 01:06:00.882
Tink. Are you all right?

01:06:01.249 --> 01:06:04.549
Wendy? The boys?

01:06:08.214 --> 01:06:12.060
But I've gotta save you first.
Hold on, Tink! Hold on!

01:06:12.510 --> 01:06:15.605
Don't go out.
Don't you understand, Tink?

01:06:16.055 --> 01:06:19.685
You mean more to me
than anything in this whole world!

01:06:21.895 --> 01:06:26.901
And now, which will it be?
The pen or the plank?

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:30.745
Captain Hook,
we will never join your crew

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:34.158
As you wish. Ladies first, me dear.

01:06:34.574 --> 01:06:37.828
- Good bye, boys.
- Goodbye, Wendy.

01:06:37.911 --> 01:06:40.915
- Be brave, John.
- I shall strive to, Wendy.

01:06:42.081 --> 01:06:44.755
- Goodbye, Michael.
- Goodbye, Wendy.

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:46.336
Come on! Get along over there!

01:06:46.419 --> 01:06:48.012
Get going! Don't give us no trouble!

01:06:48.087 --> 01:06:51.136
Go on! Go on! Get it over with!

01:06:51.216 --> 01:06:54.095
- Move along!
- The captain's waitin'!

01:07:01.476 --> 01:07:03.228
Wendy!Wendy!

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:11.407
Captain, no splash.

01:07:11.611 --> 01:07:12.908
Not a sound.

01:07:13.196 --> 01:07:16.496
- Not a bloomin' ripple.
- It's a jinx, that's what it is.

01:07:16.574 --> 01:07:19.248
- No splash.
- No sign of the wench.

01:07:19.327 --> 01:07:20.749
Did you hear a splash?

01:07:20.828 --> 01:07:23.206
I'm telling you, mates, it's a black day.

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:25.542
Mark me words. We'll all pay for this.

01:07:25.750 --> 01:07:27.923
The ship is bewitched.

01:07:28.002 --> 01:07:30.096
No splash, captain.

01:07:30.463 --> 01:07:35.060
So you want a splash, Mr Starkey.

01:07:35.593 --> 01:07:37.766
I'll give you a splash!

01:07:37.845 --> 01:07:40.189
- Who's next?
- You're next, Hook!

01:07:40.598 --> 01:07:44.523
- This time you've gone too far!
- It's Pan! Peter Pan!

01:07:44.602 --> 01:07:46.400
- And Wendy!
- It can't be!

01:07:46.479 --> 01:07:48.823
It's his blinkin' ghost what's talkin'!

01:07:48.898 --> 01:07:50.650
Say your prayers, Hook.

01:07:50.733 --> 01:07:54.408
I'll show you this ghost
has blood in his veins.

01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:57.874
I'll run him through!

01:07:58.283 --> 01:08:00.285
Take that!

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:08.839
Curse this hook!

01:08:10.837 --> 01:08:12.839
Come on, everybody!

01:08:16.134 --> 01:08:18.011
Hurry, Michael! Hurry!

01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:22.019
Don't stand there, you bilge rats!

01:08:22.098 --> 01:08:24.520
Get those scurvy brats!

01:08:25.518 --> 01:08:27.520
After the brats, men!

01:08:53.379 --> 01:08:55.676
This is no mere boy.

01:08:55.756 --> 01:08:59.182
'Tis some fiend fighting me.
A flying devil!

01:09:07.268 --> 01:09:09.395
- Hold your fire.
- Get 'em!

01:09:09.479 --> 01:09:11.777
Steady, men. Steady.

01:09:12.564 --> 01:09:14.488
- Club 'em with the marline.
- Fire!

01:09:14.567 --> 01:09:17.616
- I'll crack their bloomin' skulls!
- Let me at 'em!

01:09:18.363 --> 01:09:20.036
Down, you blackguard!

01:09:57.443 --> 01:09:58.945
Hurray!

01:10:03.700 --> 01:10:06.544
- Right through, Michael.
- Yea, Bear Killer!

01:10:06.619 --> 01:10:08.371
Yea for Bear Killer!

01:10:08.454 --> 01:10:11.799
Fly! Fly! Fly! You coward!

01:10:12.041 --> 01:10:13.418
Coward? Me?

01:10:15.294 --> 01:10:19.015
You wouldn't dare fight
old Hook man-to-man!

01:10:19.090 --> 01:10:21.889
You'd fly away like a cowardly sparrow!

01:10:21.968 --> 01:10:24.687
Nobody calls Pan a coward and lives!

01:10:24.762 --> 01:10:27.811
I'll fight you man-to-man,
one hand behind my back.

01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:34.109
- You mean you won't fly?
- No, don't, Peter! It's a trick!

01:10:34.188 --> 01:10:38.489
- I give my word, Hook.
- Good, then let's have at it!

01:10:59.046 --> 01:11:00.468
Now!

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:04.515
Insolent youth, prepare to die!

01:11:04.594 --> 01:11:07.143
Fly! Fly, Peter! Fly!

01:11:07.221 --> 01:11:10.395
No! I gave my word.

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:15.863
You're mine, Hook!

01:11:18.775 --> 01:11:21.028
Cleave him to the brisket!

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:25.873
You wouldn't do old Hook in now,
would you, lad?

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:31.038
I'll go away forever.
I'll do anything you say.

01:11:31.370 --> 01:11:35.216
Well, all right. If ya say you're a codfish.

01:11:37.210 --> 01:11:40.214
- I'm a codfish.
- Louder!

01:11:40.671 --> 01:11:43.299
I'm a codfish!

01:11:43.382 --> 01:11:45.100
Hurray!

01:11:45.176 --> 01:11:49.556
<i>Hook is a codfish, a codfish, a codfish</i>

01:11:49.639 --> 01:11:51.516
<i>Hook is a codfish...</i>

01:11:51.599 --> 01:11:53.693
All right, Hook,

01:11:53.768 --> 01:11:57.363
you're free to go, and never return.

01:12:01.984 --> 01:12:03.486
Peter!

01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:14.588
Smee! Smee!

01:12:28.094 --> 01:12:29.311
Smee!

01:12:31.931 --> 01:12:34.980
Smee! Smee!

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:39.272
Smee!

01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:42.616
Captain!

01:12:43.693 --> 01:12:45.787
Captain! Captain!

01:12:47.572 --> 01:12:48.915
Hurray!

01:12:50.074 --> 01:12:53.544
Hurray for Captain Pan!

01:12:53.619 --> 01:12:56.919
All right, ya swabs, aloft with ya!

01:12:56.998 --> 01:13:00.798
We're castin' off! Heave those halyards!

01:13:01.294 --> 01:13:04.969
But, Peter... That is, Captain Pan.

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:06.549
At your service, madam.

01:13:07.008 --> 01:13:09.978
Could you tell me, sir,
where we're sailing?

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:11.971
To London, madam.

01:13:12.430 --> 01:13:13.977
Peter.

01:13:14.473 --> 01:13:18.228
Michael! John! We're going home!

01:13:18.311 --> 01:13:20.530
Man the capstan!

01:13:21.272 --> 01:13:23.991
Hoist anchor!

01:13:27.069 --> 01:13:28.662
Pixie dust!

01:14:07.151 --> 01:14:10.121
George, I'm so glad
you changed your mind about Wendy.

01:14:10.196 --> 01:14:12.699
After all, she's still a child.

01:14:12.782 --> 01:14:15.877
Mary, you know
I never mean those things.

01:14:16.535 --> 01:14:18.128
Do I, Nana?

01:14:23.167 --> 01:14:24.384
Wendy!

01:14:26.921 --> 01:14:30.221
Wendy, what on earth
are you doing there?

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:37.352
- Mother, we're back!
- Back?

01:14:37.431 --> 01:14:40.150
All except the Lost Boys.
They weren't quite ready.

01:14:40.226 --> 01:14:42.945
- Lost bo... Ready?
- To grow up.

01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:45.148
That's why they went
back to Never Land.

01:14:45.231 --> 01:14:48.280
- Never Land?
- Yes, but I am.

01:14:49.318 --> 01:14:51.912
- "Am?l"
- Ready to grow up.

01:14:54.740 --> 01:14:57.914
Well, my dear, all in good time.

01:14:58.202 --> 01:15:01.081
- After all, perhaps we were too...
- But, Mother,

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:03.382
it was such a wonderful adventure.

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:06.427
Tinker Bell and the mermaids
and Peter Pan.

01:15:06.919 --> 01:15:08.717
He was the most wonderful of all.

01:15:08.796 --> 01:15:11.470
- Why, even when we were kidnapped...
- Kidnapped!

01:15:12.299 --> 01:15:15.178
I knew Peter Pan would save us,
and he did.

01:15:15.261 --> 01:15:17.605
And we all called him a codfish!

01:15:18.764 --> 01:15:20.516
Captain Hook, I mean.

01:15:20.599 --> 01:15:24.194
And then we sailed away
on a ship in the sky.

01:15:25.271 --> 01:15:28.070
Mary, I'm going to bed.

01:15:29.275 --> 01:15:33.405
Oh, Mother.
He really is wonderful, isn't he?

01:15:34.321 --> 01:15:36.870
See how well he sails the ship.

01:15:37.158 --> 01:15:38.910
George. George!

01:15:38.993 --> 01:15:41.212
Now what, Mary?

01:15:44.915 --> 01:15:46.917
Nana, did you see...

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:54.142
You know, I have the strangest feeling
that I've seen that ship before.

01:15:54.508 --> 01:15:56.135
A long time ago,

01:15:56.802 --> 01:15:58.975
when I was very young.

01:15:59.472 --> 01:16:02.351
- George, dear.
- Father.

01:16:03.934 --> 01:16:07.108
<i>When there's a smile in your heart</i>

01:16:07.188 --> 01:16:11.989
<i>There's no better time to start</i>

01:16:12.568 --> 01:16:14.616
<i>Think of all the joy you'll find</i>

01:16:14.695 --> 01:16:16.618
<i>When you leave the world behind</i>

01:16:16.697 --> 01:16:20.327
<i>And bid your cares goodbye</i>

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:25.836
<i>You can fly</i>

01:16:26.499 --> 01:16:31.801
<i>You can fly</i>

01:16:32.305 --> 01:16:38.837
