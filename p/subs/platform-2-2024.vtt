00:41.200 --> 00:42.760
- Anything?
- Well...

00:42.760 --> 00:43.920
- Asparagus.
- Lasagna.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.400
- Pizza.
- Um...

00:45.400 --> 00:47.320
Warm chocolate cake with coconut sugar.

00:47.320 --> 00:49.040
Fried eggs and french fries.

00:49.040 --> 00:51.920
- I want a raw vegan salad.
- I eat pizza every day.

00:51.920 --> 00:52.960
Garlic shrimp, I'd say.

00:52.960 --> 00:55.520
Could the vanilla ice cream be served
on a <i>separate</i> dish, please?

00:55.520 --> 00:58.040
And I want the yolk to be solid.

00:58.040 --> 01:00.600
- With some bulgur wheat.
- The one with the most meat.

01:00.600 --> 01:02.360
I hate it if they touch before I eat it.

01:02.360 --> 01:04.600
- Not broken.
- Beef, pork, and chicken.

01:04.600 --> 01:05.520
And with turmeric.

01:05.520 --> 01:06.480
An object...

That pen.

01:10.840 --> 01:12.320
- A razor.
- An axe?

01:12.320 --> 01:13.800
- A dildo.
- A dagger.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.640
[chuckles] Okay, I was joking.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.400

01:26.440 --> 01:27.640

01:28.520 --> 01:29.840
How upset?

01:30.960 --> 01:33.080
You know the reason why I'm here, right?

01:33.080 --> 01:34.920
- [pages rustle]
- [male interviewer] Hmm.

01:35.920 --> 01:39.400
It says here that you tried
to set fire to your parents' house

01:39.920 --> 01:41.400
while they were asleep.

01:41.400 --> 01:43.360
Well, that's how upset.

of yourselves, you motherfuckers?

01:59.480 --> 02:01.760
- Yeah, you. What are you looking at?

02:01.760 --> 02:02.960
[man 2] Hey! It's him!

02:02.960 --> 02:06.120
The one who's hiding. The guy on 21.

02:06.120 --> 02:08.720
[man 3] He ate all the meat
on the pizza and the pork loin.

02:08.720 --> 02:11.440
[woman 1] The first day,
and they're already screwing it up.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.280
[man 1] 21!

02:14.160 --> 02:15.640
[cutlery clatters]

02:17.800 --> 02:20.160
- [Frenchman] Whoa! Hey, no.
- [Frenchman's cellmate] No!

02:20.160 --> 02:23.280
- [Frenchman] Fucking new guys.
- How many times do we need to tell you?

02:24.200 --> 02:26.120
That I'm only entitled to eat my dish?

02:26.120 --> 02:30.480
Or something you swap
with someone else voluntarily, yes.

02:30.480 --> 02:31.560
It's the Law.

02:31.560 --> 02:32.800
[chuckles]

02:32.800 --> 02:37.000
You mean the Law that means
absolutely nothing to whoever ate my dish?

02:37.000 --> 02:38.560
[Frenchman's cellmate] We'll solve it,

02:38.560 --> 02:41.560
but you can't behave like a Barbarian
who eats whatever he likes.

02:41.560 --> 02:46.520
No, no. The Barbarians are the guys
on 21 who ate my stuff.

02:46.520 --> 02:49.200
I, at least, should be able
to have the right to eat something--

02:49.200 --> 02:54.440
You have the right to let us,
the Loyalists, protect your dish. Yes?

02:54.440 --> 02:55.480
That's what we're doing.

02:55.480 --> 02:58.560
If this is the way you,
the Loyalists, handle everything,

02:58.560 --> 03:00.960
then I think we're gonna have
a big problem.

03:00.960 --> 03:05.120
[laughs] It's not easy, but since
the Revolution of Solidarity began,

03:05.120 --> 03:07.840
each month, the Pit gets fairer.

03:07.840 --> 03:12.760
And with everyone's support,
the Law will soon reach the last level.

03:13.520 --> 03:18.000
Don't you see that if you eat the food
that another person has ordered,

03:18.000 --> 03:20.480
they will certainly feel... aggrieved

03:20.480 --> 03:23.120
and legitimized to eat whatever they want?

03:23.120 --> 03:25.680
That it will be detrimental
to other people,

03:25.680 --> 03:27.720
which will affect many more.

03:27.720 --> 03:32.160
And that will generate a chain disaster
that will leave those below without food.

03:39.880 --> 03:40.880
Are you done now?

03:40.880 --> 03:43.080
Listen to me, you dumbass,

03:43.080 --> 03:45.240
if you eat that chicken wing,
that's what will happen.

03:45.240 --> 03:47.200
She called me a dumbass.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.720
[softly] Watch what this dumbass does.

03:49.720 --> 03:52.480
[cellmate] Yes. That's what will happen.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.240
Sure. That's easy for you to say.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.360
No one has eaten any
of your fucking croquettes, have they?

04:03.360 --> 04:04.360
Do you want one?

04:12.560 --> 04:13.920
[sniffs]

04:19.880 --> 04:20.880
Okay.

04:20.880 --> 04:24.680
But I don't want any surprises tomorrow,
you hear me?

04:25.840 --> 04:28.800
Fine. Just make sure you eat it
before the platform leaves.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.720
The Administration
doesn't allow us to keep the food.

04:31.720 --> 04:35.160
They punish us for it.
Just once, if you know what I mean.

04:35.160 --> 04:36.760
I understand.

04:36.760 --> 04:39.560
And why don't they punish
the motherfuckers

04:39.560 --> 04:42.200
from 21 who ate my pizza?

04:42.200 --> 04:43.800
[Frenchman] Only eating our dishes,

04:43.800 --> 04:46.080
it is a rule
we have established among ourselves,

04:46.080 --> 04:47.640
not the Administration.

04:47.640 --> 04:51.560
And remember, you're lucky you woke up
on Level 24.

04:51.560 --> 04:54.080
But next month, it may be a lower one.

04:54.960 --> 04:58.560
But what you have done
on your first day is very commendable.

04:58.560 --> 05:02.200
You have respected others,
and you've kept your level tidy.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.600
Make sure to not let the Pit
keep you down.

05:04.600 --> 05:06.520

Down at Level 44,

and from there down, we don't know if food
has been distributed fairly or not.

We do know from 21 on.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.880
[Frenchman] It's not important
how many levels there are.

07:09.880 --> 07:12.680
The most important thing is
that food gets to them all.

07:12.680 --> 07:16.440
Tomorrow, our comrades
from Levels 19 and 20

07:16.440 --> 07:19.240

And the ones from Levels 42
and 43 will go down to 44,

07:23.480 --> 07:25.760
so the people down below are able to eat.

07:25.760 --> 07:26.960

- [intense music subsides]

12:07.360 --> 12:09.680
- [platform rattling below]
- [Frenchman exhales]

12:09.680 --> 12:11.040
[Perempuán] It's over.

12:11.040 --> 12:12.960
[Frenchman sighs]

12:14.600 --> 12:15.760
Well done.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.480
You're brave, huh?

12:18.400 --> 12:19.400
- [spits]
- [shouts]

12:28.280 --> 12:30.240
Is he still unconscious?

12:30.240 --> 12:31.360
Yes.

12:32.720 --> 12:34.280
[Zamiatin] Want some pizza?

12:35.000 --> 12:36.360
Want some pizza, you bastard?

12:36.360 --> 12:37.360
- Want pizza?
- Enough!

12:41.720 --> 12:44.200
This asshole has caused a lot of damage.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.960
And because of him, today nobody will eat.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.040
But we don't do things that way.

12:51.720 --> 12:53.160
[Zamiatin] No. [tuts]

12:54.080 --> 12:57.120
The way you guys do things is exquisite.

12:57.120 --> 12:58.200
What?

12:58.200 --> 13:01.200
Maybe he's not the only one responsible.
What do you think?

13:01.200 --> 13:03.720
Yesterday, I could have eaten
any other thing.

13:03.720 --> 13:06.320
There was plenty of food,
but <i>you</i> wouldn't allow it.

13:06.320 --> 13:07.640
[Frenchman] So it's our fault?

13:07.640 --> 13:11.000
I'm only saying that sometimes,
if you grant some freedom--

13:11.000 --> 13:13.600
No, no! You better shut your mouth now!

13:13.600 --> 13:15.280
No? Of course not--

13:15.280 --> 13:18.000
Freedom has nothing to do
with eating whatever you like.

13:18.000 --> 13:19.520
Nothing. Okay?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.160
[Perempuán] She's dead.

13:26.080 --> 13:27.800
[somber music playing]

13:28.880 --> 13:30.200
[Frenchman sighs deeply]

13:30.200 --> 13:32.360
[cries out] You motherfuckers!

13:32.360 --> 13:35.640
Fucking assholes! Fuck!

13:35.640 --> 13:37.880
[grunting and screaming]

13:39.400 --> 13:41.000
[sobbing]

13:46.400 --> 13:47.960
[coldly] That was very brave.

13:47.960 --> 13:49.520
[grunts]

13:49.520 --> 13:50.440
Enough!

13:52.640 --> 13:54.480
[tense music pulsing]

14:01.200 --> 14:02.800
What do we do with him?

14:07.360 --> 14:08.720
[Frenchman] You'll do nothing.

14:08.720 --> 14:11.840
I'll go down with him
until I find one of the Anointed Ones.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.600
[Zamiatin] The Anointed Ones?

14:17.720 --> 14:21.880
They are the people that were lucky enough
to meet the Master.

14:21.880 --> 14:24.040
The man who laid the foundations
of the Law.

14:24.640 --> 14:26.440
They are in charge of applying it wisely--

14:26.440 --> 14:28.280
[Zamiatin] Wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:29.640 --> 14:30.720
The Master?

14:30.720 --> 14:32.040
[faucet squeaks]

14:33.560 --> 14:35.320
Some people call him

14:36.120 --> 14:37.240
the Messiah

14:38.360 --> 14:40.120
or the Hidalgo.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.800
Nobody knows if he's still alive.

14:42.800 --> 14:45.120
Or if he ever existed. [scoffs]

14:45.120 --> 14:46.560
[Frenchman sighs]

14:46.560 --> 14:48.880
[mournful music playing]

14:52.520 --> 14:54.200
[Frenchman exhales]

15:02.520 --> 15:03.720
[sniffles]

15:10.920 --> 15:12.560
It was a long time ago.

15:12.560 --> 15:14.320
Before I got here.

15:14.880 --> 15:17.440
The Master sent a message of hope.

15:19.880 --> 15:23.160
It is said that he survived
for one full month without eating

15:23.160 --> 15:25.640
on one of the lowest levels.

15:25.640 --> 15:26.920
Meditating.

15:27.520 --> 15:29.920
The next month, he woke up on a level...

15:31.200 --> 15:33.320
a level that the food had never reached.

15:38.320 --> 15:41.480
He cut the flesh from his own thigh...

15:43.760 --> 15:45.440
and he fed all of the needy.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.160
His Anointed Ones.

15:48.160 --> 15:50.960
And since then, month after month,

15:50.960 --> 15:54.600
they have spread his message of solidarity
throughout the Pit.

15:54.600 --> 15:57.840
Defending a fair distribution of the food.

15:59.640 --> 16:01.040
[sighs]

16:01.040 --> 16:03.760
It's something
that we all can achieve together.

16:06.480 --> 16:09.120
And if heads have to roll, then so be it.

16:17.760 --> 16:21.000
Whatever you say, Robespierre.

16:21.000 --> 16:25.040
But I haven't eaten in two days.

16:26.520 --> 16:27.840
And I want my pizza!

16:27.840 --> 16:29.840
[platform whooshes by]

16:39.760 --> 16:42.080
Are you sure about that, Robespierre?

16:42.080 --> 16:43.480
Don't you think your master

16:43.480 --> 16:46.360
will be thrilled
if you cut her into pieces

16:46.360 --> 16:48.760
and shared them out among the needy?

16:49.840 --> 16:51.520
She <i>is</i> already cooked.

16:51.520 --> 16:54.120
[Robespierre] No.
Cannibalism is forbidden by the Law

16:54.120 --> 16:57.280
since the Master
showed us the way with his sacrifice.

16:57.280 --> 17:01.320
Every day, you come up
with a new rule, Robespierre.

17:03.400 --> 17:04.520
[sighs]

17:04.520 --> 17:05.600
[strains]

17:07.600 --> 17:09.960
[unsettling music rises]

17:29.720 --> 17:31.200
[body parts thud]

17:36.160 --> 17:38.440
[fierce growling]

17:40.480 --> 17:41.800
[alert sounds]

17:42.440 --> 17:44.440
[intense, rhythmic music playing]

17:49.880 --> 17:51.400
[exhales softly]

18:00.760 --> 18:02.000
[Barbarian breathing shakily]

18:05.320 --> 18:07.920
[Zamiatin laughs mockingly]

18:07.920 --> 18:10.200
Look. [chuckles scornfully]

18:19.720 --> 18:22.000
[tense music rises]

18:25.400 --> 18:27.040
[water splashes in toilet]

18:30.000 --> 18:32.040
These dishes belonged
to the ones who died yesterday.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.240
- I have to throw them away.
- Throw them away?

18:34.240 --> 18:36.560
[Robespierre] The Law doesn't allow us
more than one.

18:36.560 --> 18:38.040
Yeah, but why?

18:38.040 --> 18:39.840
The arbitrary distribution
of the leftovers

18:39.840 --> 18:41.760
grants a privilege to a small few.

18:41.760 --> 18:45.280
And nobody respects a law
that allows inequality.

18:45.280 --> 18:47.600
But the distribution
doesn't have to be arbitrary.

18:47.600 --> 18:49.480
We can still eat all of that!

18:49.480 --> 18:50.760
[toilet flushes]

18:51.280 --> 18:52.680
Okay, so...

18:52.680 --> 18:55.520
Mussels, torreznos, and roast lamb.

18:56.040 --> 18:59.800
Now you are the custodians of the meals
of those who are gone above you.

18:59.800 --> 19:03.680
Each day, you must check
that they are still intact

19:03.680 --> 19:05.760
and get rid of this source of discord.

19:05.760 --> 19:09.960
If you want to, you can swap,
but that means you must throw yours away.

19:10.560 --> 19:12.280
[plates clatter]

19:12.280 --> 19:13.320
Okay?

19:14.440 --> 19:17.120
Believe me, this is the best thing
in the long run.

19:17.120 --> 19:20.000
Nobody should ever benefit
from the murder of a comrade.

19:23.200 --> 19:24.920
[Barbarian breathing shakily]

19:29.200 --> 19:30.160
<i>Allez.</i>

19:31.080 --> 19:33.600
- [grunts]
- What are they gonna do to him now?

19:33.600 --> 19:35.160
[Barbarian groaning]

19:35.160 --> 19:37.920
It will be severe... but just.

19:39.800 --> 19:40.800
[strains]

19:43.360 --> 19:44.920
[Barbarian groans]

19:45.680 --> 19:46.840
Shh.

19:47.920 --> 19:52.280
I hope to find an Anointed One
before reaching the Level 44 barrier.

19:52.280 --> 19:54.120
There are not many left.

19:55.280 --> 19:57.320
- [alert sounds]
- [platform whirring]

19:57.320 --> 19:58.680
[Robespierre] Respect the Law.

20:00.360 --> 20:01.400
And also enforce it.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.720
[intense music pulsing]

20:09.560 --> 20:10.760
[loud munching]

[chewing loudly]

21:08.160 --> 21:10.280
[intense music continues]

21:29.000 --> 21:30.160
[speaking inaudibly]

21:30.160 --> 21:32.280
[rhythmic music building]

22:23.920 --> 22:25.800
[music subsides]

22:28.160 --> 22:29.440
[low rumbling]

22:31.520 --> 22:32.920
[ethereal music playing]

22:32.920 --> 22:34.880
[rumbling reverberates]

22:42.520 --> 22:44.280
[Zamiatin] Do you believe all that?

22:55.880 --> 22:56.960
It's the last day.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.240
Show me what you can do.

23:04.000 --> 23:06.000
[ethereal music fades slowly]

23:08.240 --> 23:10.080
I'm more of a science guy.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.120
I'm not as stupid as I look.

23:19.120 --> 23:22.880
I devoted my whole life
to pure mathematics.

23:25.840 --> 23:27.280
One day, I quit.

23:27.920 --> 23:28.920
Why's that?

23:33.880 --> 23:36.040
[charcoal scratching]

23:37.080 --> 23:38.080
[Zamiatin] This is why.

23:38.080 --> 23:40.960
The square root of minus one.

23:40.960 --> 23:43.000
The solution to this root is

23:43.000 --> 23:47.120
what in mathematics
is called an imaginary number.

23:47.920 --> 23:49.320
Imaginary.

23:52.800 --> 23:55.560
One day, I concluded
that if we accept something

23:55.560 --> 24:01.080
that doesn't match any physical reality
of our universe as a solution,

24:01.080 --> 24:04.520
I could never trust mathematics again.

24:08.240 --> 24:09.560
Or anything else.

24:13.480 --> 24:15.600
[Zamiatin coughs, groans]

24:20.240 --> 24:25.160
I left my job
at the university, my investigations.

24:29.560 --> 24:31.680
[unsettling music rises]

24:34.920 --> 24:36.720
And I abandoned my family.

24:37.760 --> 24:41.400
- You left your family because of that?
- I went back to my parents'.

24:45.240 --> 24:46.360
Do you have kids?

24:52.320 --> 24:53.960
What's wrong with the imaginary?

24:59.000 --> 25:00.800
[Zamiatin grunts]

25:07.840 --> 25:10.160
And you? Do you have kids?

25:20.240 --> 25:22.680
The imaginary doesn't exist.

25:24.640 --> 25:26.920
And it doesn't have a purpose.

25:32.520 --> 25:34.680
What's your story, Perempuán?

25:37.280 --> 25:38.880
[Perempuán] <i>I need time to...</i>

25:42.080 --> 25:43.640
to forgive myself.

25:45.480 --> 25:49.840
[woman, below] This month,
food has reached Level 175!

25:49.840 --> 25:51.000
[man cheers]

25:51.000 --> 25:54.560
- [woman] 175!
- [inmates cheering and whistling]

25:54.560 --> 25:57.480
- [woman] 175!
- You hear that? 175.

25:58.800 --> 26:00.000
[woman] Yes!

26:05.920 --> 26:06.920
[Perempuán] Come on.

26:06.920 --> 26:08.280
- [Zamiatin] Why?
- Let's dance.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.600
You wanna dance?

26:09.600 --> 26:11.400
You're crazy.

26:12.960 --> 26:15.320
["Sleeping Beauty Waltz"
by Tchaikovsky playing]

26:20.520 --> 26:22.200
[Zamiatin grunts]

26:26.760 --> 26:27.760
[glumly] Fine.

26:27.760 --> 26:30.400
[enchanting, regal waltz continues]

26:40.960 --> 26:43.040
- [dreamlike waltz concludes]
- [man 1] No!

26:43.040 --> 26:44.800
- [screaming]
- [man 2] Oh my God!

26:45.760 --> 26:47.240
[Zamiatin exhales anxiously]

26:50.920 --> 26:55.040
[woman 1, above] 179,
cannelloni and sweet and sour pork.

26:56.760 --> 26:58.560
[Perempuán] Pizza and croquettes, here.

26:59.080 --> 27:01.560
[woman 2] Down there,
they're saying they won't cooperate.

27:01.560 --> 27:04.560
They'll eat everything that arrives.
<i>When</i> it arrives.

27:05.080 --> 27:06.000
What's your dish?

27:06.000 --> 27:10.480
- I ordered a dessert. Pantxineta.
- [Zamiatin coughing]

27:12.120 --> 27:13.160
[Perempuán sighs]

27:14.560 --> 27:17.440
It would be nice to have dessert
for lunch some days.

27:18.920 --> 27:20.760
[Zamiatin] Can't you see where we are?

27:20.760 --> 27:22.880
The system is improving every month.

27:22.880 --> 27:24.680
- We can't start doubting it.
- [woman 3] 169!

27:24.680 --> 27:26.440
[man 1] 169!

27:27.080 --> 27:28.640
Is there any news from up there?

27:28.640 --> 27:32.360
The chain is cut at 169.
We don't know anything.

27:32.360 --> 27:35.000
[Zamiatin] I hope the Law
is being enforced by Robespierre's gang

27:35.000 --> 27:37.080
and they are kicking ass right now.

27:37.080 --> 27:38.720
[delirious man, below] The Law is love.

27:38.720 --> 27:41.280
The Law is determination.

27:41.280 --> 27:44.520
The Law is love under determination.

27:45.120 --> 27:48.720
Don't let fools confound you
because there is love in the Pit.

27:48.720 --> 27:53.160
They feel alone and helpless, but the Law...

27:53.160 --> 27:55.120
The Law is for everyone.

27:55.680 --> 27:59.000
Last month, he spent 25 days
without eating. On 169.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.160
Fucking moron.

28:00.160 --> 28:03.080
My cellmate is new.
There's lots of new people up there.

28:03.080 --> 28:04.120
[woman 2] And below.

28:05.040 --> 28:07.160
That means a lot of people
died last month.

28:07.160 --> 28:10.160
We were also new here,
and we learned how to respect the Law.

28:10.160 --> 28:14.200
We learned how to respect the Law
on Level 24.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.280
[alert sounds]

28:17.280 --> 28:18.400

28:20.320 --> 28:22.440
[dishes clatter]

28:24.760 --> 28:26.760
[delirious man, below]
We have all been chosen.

28:26.760 --> 28:30.240
We will all be raised on high.

28:30.240 --> 28:35.560
And regrets are nothing but shadows
that pass and go away.

28:35.560 --> 28:38.440
And sorrow is not in us.

28:38.440 --> 28:41.160
Strength and love are in us.

28:41.160 --> 28:46.360
Look. Look at the light
that the Master radiates upon us.

28:46.360 --> 28:47.440
[tense music building]

28:48.200 --> 28:52.000
[delirious man, echoing] <i>Even if our home
is destroyed by fire and sword,</i>

28:52.000 --> 28:54.640

<i>- His invisible house will stand firm.</i>
- [coughs weakly]

29:08.120 --> 29:09.720
<i>He's the magician!</i>

29:10.600 --> 29:11.960
<i>He is life.</i>

29:12.960 --> 29:14.120
<i>And he gives life.</i>

29:17.040 --> 29:19.640
<i>- He is the flame that burns...</i>
- [lighter clicks]

29:19.640 --> 29:21.880
[delirious man] <i>In the heart
of all mankind</i>

29:21.880 --> 29:24.560
<i>and at the core of all stars.</i>

29:25.080 --> 29:30.200
<i>Look. Look at the light that the Master
radiates upon us.</i>

29:30.200 --> 29:32.560
<i>If determination stops when shouting why,</i>

29:32.560 --> 29:36.640
<i>and then determination stops,
and it is not done.</i>

29:36.640 --> 29:40.040
<i>The idiot sees the Law
but does not understand it.</i>

29:41.680 --> 29:43.800
<i>- He is the flame that burns.</i>
- Would you fucking stop?

29:43.800 --> 29:46.800
[Zamiatin wheezing]

29:47.960 --> 29:50.120
[blood splatters]

29:50.120 --> 29:51.480
[sounds distort]

29:55.440 --> 29:56.800
[woman 2] It's the sign!

29:56.800 --> 29:59.800
[woman 1] It's the Anointed Ones
freeing the Pit of the Barbarians.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.080
There's no more fear.

30:01.080 --> 30:03.280
Instead of murdering everybody,
why don't they come down

30:03.280 --> 30:04.240
and protect our food?

30:04.240 --> 30:06.280
And leave the ones
who don't respect the Law above?

30:06.280 --> 30:08.240
That would be suicide for the rest!

30:08.240 --> 30:09.560
[coughing]

30:09.560 --> 30:13.760
The Law is power, severity, and order.

30:13.760 --> 30:16.640
He who is upright shall remain upright!

30:16.640 --> 30:18.640
He who is filthy shall remain filthy!

30:18.640 --> 30:20.920
Shut up, asshole!

30:20.920 --> 30:22.120
[continues coughing]

30:27.200 --> 30:28.760
[Perempuán] Where'd it come from?

30:28.760 --> 30:30.360
[woman 1] A long way up.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.440
We'll still have to wait a few more days.

30:32.440 --> 30:34.440
[coughing weakly]

30:38.240 --> 30:42.080
[delirious man] <i>We have to seek
and destroy the traitors.</i>

30:43.600 --> 30:45.240
<i>Their death will be beautiful.</i>

30:45.880 --> 30:50.040
<i>Their death will seal
our true and only love.</i>

30:51.080 --> 30:52.840
[gently] <i>Do good here,</i>

30:52.840 --> 30:56.400
<i>and you'll be rewarded forevermore.</i>

30:56.400 --> 30:58.160
[platform whooshes by]

30:58.960 --> 31:05.240
[delirious man] <i>Do good here,
and you'll be rewarded forevermore.</i>

31:05.240 --> 31:07.120
[woman 1] I have good news.

31:07.120 --> 31:11.600
There's only the blockage on 169 and 168.

31:11.600 --> 31:15.240
Those Barbarians are trying
to sabotage the communication,

31:15.240 --> 31:19.800
but the Anointed One who leads
the liberation wants us to be strong.

31:19.800 --> 31:21.200
[Zamiatin wheezing]

31:21.200 --> 31:22.800
Listen to me.

31:23.320 --> 31:26.560
He's asking us to identify
the crippled man

31:26.560 --> 31:31.480
and the cross-eyed woman
who gorged themselves on 176.

31:31.480 --> 31:35.720
And the giant man who assaulted
his male cellmate on 98.

31:35.720 --> 31:38.440
- [woman 3 shouts indistinctly]
- What was that about 24?

31:38.440 --> 31:42.360
The fat guy on 24!
He stole food from his fallen brothers!

31:42.360 --> 31:48.320
A fat man, while he was on level 24,
ate from the dishes of his dead comrades.

31:48.320 --> 31:49.800
What a motherfucker.

31:51.720 --> 31:53.080
What level were <i>you</i> on?

31:53.080 --> 31:54.440
On 46.

31:55.680 --> 31:56.760
And you?

31:59.240 --> 32:01.800
- [woman 1] 74.
- Fine.

32:03.880 --> 32:04.960
Fine.

32:08.760 --> 32:11.840
[Perempuán, gently] Don't worry.
Nobody knows we were on 24.

32:11.840 --> 32:13.440
[Zamiatin, weakly] They saw us.

32:14.640 --> 32:19.200
When the food gets here,
we can only eat our dishes.

32:19.760 --> 32:21.480
Or the ones we can exchange.

32:21.480 --> 32:23.400
And I ordered pizza.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.840
I ordered croquettes.

32:24.840 --> 32:27.320
[chuckles sadly, coughs]

32:30.400 --> 32:33.880
Maybe I'll die if I don't eat enough.

32:34.400 --> 32:37.240
The day they get here,
we'll have to behave.

32:37.240 --> 32:39.680
But after, we'll do whatever it takes.

32:39.680 --> 32:41.000
We'll be punished.

32:45.480 --> 32:46.680
[sighs]

32:54.080 --> 32:55.120
[Perempuán grunts]

32:59.680 --> 33:01.680
[intense music rising]

33:05.440 --> 33:09.560
[male interviewer] No, you're not here
because they're afraid of you.

33:10.440 --> 33:12.480
You dropped out of school at 16.

33:14.160 --> 33:16.800
<i>All your business ventures failed.</i>

33:18.160 --> 33:21.160
<i>Your wife and kids kicked you out.</i>

33:22.840 --> 33:25.680
<i>And your parents
are getting sick of you too.</i>

33:30.120 --> 33:32.360
You were offered a place

33:32.360 --> 33:36.080
because they think you need
some... discipline.

33:36.600 --> 33:38.600
[somber music playing]

33:43.400 --> 33:44.400
Discipline?

33:44.400 --> 33:46.560
[grunts]

33:47.840 --> 33:49.560
[Zamiatin] <i>Discipline for what?</i>

33:51.440 --> 33:52.680
[male interviewer] <i>Discipline</i>

33:53.640 --> 33:57.960
<i>to stop you making those pathetic
calls for attention.</i>

33:57.960 --> 34:00.040
[Zamiatin breathing shakily]

34:07.560 --> 34:08.960
[coughing]

34:25.560 --> 34:27.040
[lighter clicks]

34:29.360 --> 34:32.800
- What are you doing?
- [Zamiatin] I've made a lot of mistakes.

34:34.920 --> 34:36.120
They are good kids.

34:37.320 --> 34:39.760
Not very clever.
They take after their mother.

34:40.280 --> 34:41.760
I don't harbor resentment.

34:44.680 --> 34:46.320
What do you mean?

34:46.320 --> 34:48.280
[Zamiatin] I ate what wasn't mine.

34:50.680 --> 34:51.640
Stay away.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.640
I shouldn't have eaten.

34:56.440 --> 34:57.480
Stay away.

35:01.040 --> 35:02.880
- Stay away! Discipline!
- [gasps]

35:02.880 --> 35:04.800
I don't want to drag you down with me.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.480
You don't deserve
to be punished for helping me.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.600
[Perempuán breathing shakily]

35:13.600 --> 35:15.760
Go and see my kids
when you get out of here.

35:15.760 --> 35:18.160
Tell them I've always loved them.

35:18.160 --> 35:20.400
Tell them that, at least, my end...

35:22.440 --> 35:23.840
wasn't a lie.

35:31.120 --> 35:33.640
[somber music building]

35:37.520 --> 35:39.600
[crying softly]

35:50.720 --> 35:52.720

[embers crackling]

36:36.640 --> 36:40.160
[ominous droning]

36:43.240 --> 36:45.080
[Perempuán] <i>I'd like to think
he didn't suffer.</i>

36:45.080 --> 36:48.000
- [alert sounds]
- [bittersweet music fades]

36:48.000 --> 36:49.560
That he died quickly.

36:51.680 --> 36:52.800
[sounds distort]

36:52.800 --> 36:55.200
[excited voices echoing]

37:13.240 --> 37:14.400
[woman 1, above] Hello.

37:14.920 --> 37:17.120
It looks like everything's good up there.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.920
They haven't identified any Barbarian.

37:19.920 --> 37:22.080
We have paella and egg fried rice.

37:22.080 --> 37:23.080
[Perempuán] Croquettes.

37:23.080 --> 37:25.920
[bearded Loyalist] Raw vegan salad,
entrecôte steak with pepper sauce.

37:25.920 --> 37:29.400
Down to 71, everyone is a Loyalist
or a newcomer.

37:29.400 --> 37:30.800
Let's see how they behave.

37:37.400 --> 37:39.440
- [faucet squeaks]
- [water running]

37:39.440 --> 37:40.960
[Perempuán] We've been lucky.

37:40.960 --> 37:42.560
51's a good level.

37:43.080 --> 37:45.280
Once a day,
a platform with food will go down.

37:46.800 --> 37:49.640
We'll have a few minutes
to eat the dish we've chosen.

37:49.640 --> 37:52.160
- What did you choose?
- [faucet squeaks off]

37:53.360 --> 37:55.200
- Hey. Hey!
- [snaps fingers]

37:55.200 --> 37:57.440
[ominous music playing]

37:59.760 --> 38:02.120
- [Perempuán] What did you choose?
- Just plums.

38:02.120 --> 38:05.480
You'll only be able to eat that
unless you arrange an exchange.

38:20.960 --> 38:22.360
Is that your object?

38:24.040 --> 38:25.200
My pillow.

38:28.080 --> 38:30.040
I can't sleep without it.

38:30.960 --> 38:32.640
[ominous music subsides]

38:32.640 --> 38:34.720
[gentle music playing]

38:35.600 --> 38:37.520
[alert sounds]

38:50.840 --> 38:54.040
[woman 1, above] Some of the newcomers
wouldn't respect the rules.

38:54.040 --> 38:56.080
It looks like there are two obstacles.

38:56.080 --> 38:59.200
One on 46 and another one higher up.

38:59.200 --> 39:03.600
But there is an Anointed One above,
and he won't take long to pacify them.

39:03.600 --> 39:05.400
[plates clatter]

39:21.600 --> 39:22.960
You'll eat tomorrow.

39:22.960 --> 39:25.800
- [platform whirring]
- [lighter clicking]

39:28.600 --> 39:31.760
[woman 2] Barbarian! Barbarian! Barbarian!
There's a barbarian on 54!

39:31.760 --> 39:33.000
[man 2, below] 54!

39:33.000 --> 39:36.120
- [woman 3] Barbarian on 54!
- There's a Barbarian on 54!

39:36.120 --> 39:37.680
He was pretending to be one of us,

39:37.680 --> 39:40.480
but they recognized him,
and he attacked his new cellmate.

39:40.480 --> 39:44.360
- [woman 4] The one from 2! He was on 2!
- [bearded Loyalist] That one! From 2!

39:44.360 --> 39:47.400
He was on Level 2 last month,
and the people from 1 couldn't stop him.

39:47.400 --> 39:49.800
They said he ate like a pig,
the motherfucker!

39:50.640 --> 39:54.080
- Every day, until he threw up.
- Tomorrow we'll go down to pacify him!

39:54.080 --> 39:55.760
- And that's it.
- I'll go down with you.

39:55.760 --> 39:57.200
[bearded Loyalist] There's no need.

39:57.200 --> 39:59.040
We can't let that son of a bitch escape.

39:59.040 --> 40:01.040
He won't escape, but the rules are clear.

40:01.040 --> 40:04.240
First, the four people
from the levels immediately above.

40:14.120 --> 40:15.840
My cellmate died

40:15.840 --> 40:17.720
because of assholes
like that one down there

40:17.720 --> 40:20.840
who stuffed himself on Level 2 last month.

40:21.880 --> 40:24.280
If the Law isn't respected, people die.

40:24.280 --> 40:26.720
The higher up you are,
the more responsibility.

40:27.240 --> 40:28.720
Do you understand?

40:29.240 --> 40:31.240
[tense music playing]

40:38.800 --> 40:40.360
[cellmate] I understand your anger.

40:41.480 --> 40:44.440
It's people like that
who fuck everything up.

40:45.400 --> 40:47.160
[sounds distort]

40:50.240 --> 40:52.200
[lighter clicking rapidly]

41:02.720 --> 41:04.640
[intense music peaks, dies down]

41:04.640 --> 41:06.720
[lighter clicking steadily]

41:17.120 --> 41:19.120
[clicking grows faster]

41:27.800 --> 41:29.040
[distant scream]

41:31.120 --> 41:32.640
[sounds distort]

41:32.640 --> 41:34.240
[man 1] Fuck you!

41:34.240 --> 41:37.000
[woman 1] Yes! Yes! It's Dagin Babi!

41:37.720 --> 41:40.320
The Anointed One is Dagin Babi! Hey!

41:40.320 --> 41:42.480
It's Dagin Babi.

41:42.480 --> 41:44.320
The Anointed One is Dagin Babi.

41:44.320 --> 41:45.960
We're saved.

41:46.480 --> 41:48.200
He will take no prisoners.

41:48.200 --> 41:51.120
- [inmates chanting] Babi! Babi! Babi!
- [man 4] He has come!

41:51.120 --> 41:53.200
[inmates] Babi! Babi!

41:53.200 --> 41:55.520
- Babi! Babi!

[plates clatter]

42:12.160 --> 42:14.520
[intense music playing]

42:27.160 --> 42:28.880
We can't let that asshole escape.

42:32.360 --> 42:34.960
- What the hell are you doing?
- Justice.

42:36.840 --> 42:37.840
[alert sounds]

42:37.840 --> 42:40.360
[platform whirring]

43:01.360 --> 43:03.360
What the fuck?
No, you two can't be down here.

43:03.360 --> 43:05.280
- Better six than four.
- That's against the Law.

43:05.280 --> 43:07.160
And you're endangering
the communication chain.

43:07.160 --> 43:10.760
The communication chain can be maintained
perfectly well with three empty levels.

43:10.760 --> 43:13.680
- But it's our turn.
- No. We're not getting off.

43:13.680 --> 43:15.000
[Perempuán] You can choose.

43:15.000 --> 43:18.400
Risk your lives with us or stay
and don't break the fucking chain.

43:21.600 --> 43:23.720
You can go down with them.
I'll preserve the chain.

43:28.760 --> 43:29.800
[alert sounds]

43:33.920 --> 43:35.720
[Barbarian] Shut it, motherfuckers!

43:35.720 --> 43:36.960
I'll fuck you up!

43:36.960 --> 43:37.960
[shouts]

43:37.960 --> 43:40.480
Motherfuckers! You're useless. Shut up!

43:41.400 --> 43:44.360
We need more people to finish that pig.
Orders from above.

43:44.360 --> 43:47.440
[Barbarian] Shut up, son of a bitch.
Shut up, or I'll fucking kill you!

43:47.440 --> 43:48.720
Don't come down!

43:49.400 --> 43:51.960
What do you want?
What do you want? I'll kill you!

43:51.960 --> 43:54.800
[suspenseful music playing]

43:55.720 --> 43:58.200
[Barbarian] Okay.
I'll kill you all, motherfuckers!

43:58.200 --> 43:59.360
Come down, I dare you!

I'll stop. [panting]

44:38.560 --> 44:39.840

45:19.960 --> 45:22.160
- [panting]
- Hold on. Wait. Hold on.

45:22.160 --> 45:23.920
Wait, wait.

45:25.880 --> 45:27.520
- I haven't done anything wrong.
- [shouts]

45:28.680 --> 45:30.960
- [panting]
- [Barbarian] Let me keep going.

45:30.960 --> 45:32.800
I've been stuck here
over a year and a half.

45:32.800 --> 45:34.280
- [Perempuán grunts]
- [moans]

45:35.840 --> 45:36.800
Please.

45:36.800 --> 45:39.320
[panting] I needed what I ate to recover.

45:39.320 --> 45:41.400
- [shouts]
- Please, please, please.

45:41.400 --> 45:43.920
I'm just trying to survive
in here, like everyone else.

45:43.920 --> 45:45.440
[whimpers, coughs]

45:45.440 --> 45:47.560
[breathing heavily]

45:47.560 --> 45:49.200
[crying softly]

45:49.800 --> 45:50.640
[grunts angrily]

45:50.640 --> 45:51.720
[alert sounds]

45:55.080 --> 45:56.600
[grunts]

45:56.600 --> 45:57.520
No!

45:57.520 --> 45:59.480
No. No!

45:59.480 --> 46:02.360
- [Perempuán] No! No!
- We have to keep going down!

46:02.360 --> 46:04.360
- He won't get far.
- [groaning]

46:05.440 --> 46:07.920
[cellmate] It's not about him.
It's not about him.

46:07.920 --> 46:09.840
- [Perempuán] No?
- It's not about him.

46:09.840 --> 46:11.760
[both panting]

46:19.920 --> 46:22.160
It's not your first month in the Pit,
is it?

46:40.000 --> 46:42.000
[faint, ominous music playing]

46:44.120 --> 46:46.400
- [fabric ripping]
- [reverberations resonate]

47:01.640 --> 47:03.480
[cellmate] I've been here for six months.

47:04.520 --> 47:05.520
[sighs]

47:06.560 --> 47:07.600
[exhales]

47:08.320 --> 47:09.800
On my first day,

47:11.160 --> 47:12.280
my cellmate,

47:14.360 --> 47:15.600
Kekasih,

47:17.280 --> 47:18.800
she explained...

47:18.800 --> 47:20.000
[takes a deep breath]

47:20.520 --> 47:22.240
...the Law, and...

47:22.240 --> 47:23.800
and I understood it.

47:23.800 --> 47:25.640
It's an unfair law.

47:27.320 --> 47:31.720
Because it just protects
the meal we enter the Pit with,

47:32.240 --> 47:33.280
but...

47:36.120 --> 47:38.160
I believed it was a good start.

47:42.920 --> 47:45.920
We always respected the Law.

47:47.280 --> 47:49.880
We only ate our portions

47:50.680 --> 47:54.480
and took part in pacifications
when it was necessary.

47:57.600 --> 47:58.920
But one day...

47:58.920 --> 48:00.680
[somber music rising]

48:00.680 --> 48:02.520
...we found a young man.

48:02.520 --> 48:05.640
Malnourished, almost dead.

48:05.640 --> 48:07.440
We took the dish of a dead person

48:07.440 --> 48:10.560
and gave him more food
than he was entitled to.

48:15.160 --> 48:16.960
And a few days later...

48:18.520 --> 48:20.400
an Anointed One came.

48:21.080 --> 48:22.120
[sighs]

48:22.120 --> 48:23.480
Dagin Babi.

48:25.200 --> 48:29.000
Dagin Babi is the strictest Anointed One.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.960
He gets stricter every month.

48:30.960 --> 48:32.320
Much more.

48:33.240 --> 48:37.800
He decided to give out
an exemplary punishment.

48:40.160 --> 48:41.840
For breaking the Law.

48:41.840 --> 48:43.400
[sighs]

48:44.440 --> 48:47.040
Kekasih resisted, and...

48:48.040 --> 48:50.120
[voice breaking] ...she gouged out his eyes.

48:50.120 --> 48:51.360
[exhales shakily]

48:54.480 --> 48:55.480
[sniffles]

48:55.480 --> 48:58.720
Dagin Babi ordered
that she be tied naked to the platform

48:58.720 --> 49:02.320
and sent her defenseless
to the lower levels.

49:02.320 --> 49:03.520
[sniffles]

49:05.560 --> 49:11.160
They forced me to watch
as a few levels down, they ate her alive.

49:11.160 --> 49:13.720
[sobbing]

49:14.840 --> 49:16.760
[gentle music playing]

49:18.920 --> 49:21.480
We will never be safe inside of the Pit.

49:23.080 --> 49:25.600
Never. [sobs softly]

49:28.200 --> 49:30.640
Not all Anointed Ones are the same.

49:30.640 --> 49:32.080
Last month,

49:32.080 --> 49:35.960
one of them arrived in time to save
a lot of people from starving to death.

49:35.960 --> 49:39.320
How do you think he opened
the way to your level?

49:47.280 --> 49:49.320
We just have to keep on helping.

49:51.960 --> 49:53.480
Being fairer.

49:56.320 --> 49:59.920
We have to hold on
until we can get out of here.

49:59.920 --> 50:02.520
[scoffs] Haven't you noticed?

50:03.680 --> 50:06.040
No one... gets out of here.

50:06.880 --> 50:09.560
No one here will survive.

50:09.560 --> 50:12.240
[somber music playing]

50:17.600 --> 50:20.480
[distant scream above]

50:23.120 --> 50:25.000
[cellmate] But there's something
we can do.

50:25.000 --> 50:26.640
Escape.

50:32.080 --> 50:34.200
[whispering] Escape during the interval.

50:36.600 --> 50:37.600
The what?

50:39.600 --> 50:44.680
At the end of every month,
well, to reset the Pit,

50:44.680 --> 50:47.560
they... the gas they're using

50:47.560 --> 50:49.800
is a variant of sevoflurane.

50:52.320 --> 50:54.320
We have to do it in that moment.

50:54.840 --> 50:57.920
But... what's going to stop us
from sleeping?

50:59.400 --> 51:02.440
Every month, I search for it.

51:02.440 --> 51:04.080
So far I haven't been lucky.

51:04.080 --> 51:08.480
But we'll only have one opportunity
if we find it.

51:12.720 --> 51:16.640
To do that... we have to keep going down.

51:19.120 --> 51:20.880
[Perempuán] What are we looking for?

51:21.400 --> 51:23.720
[platform whooshes by]

51:24.720 --> 51:26.520
[man moaning above]

51:26.520 --> 51:28.280
[alert sounds]

51:28.280 --> 51:30.640
[tied man] No. No, no, no! [cries out]

51:32.000 --> 51:33.800
- [Perempuán gasps]
- [blood splatters]

51:34.920 --> 51:37.840
That's Dagin's signature.
It's now or never.

51:37.840 --> 51:39.200
[breathing shakily]

51:39.200 --> 51:40.760
[platform whirring above]

51:40.760 --> 51:42.880
Dagin Babi and his people

51:42.880 --> 51:46.520
must be coming down on the platform,
but there was a blockage at 46.

51:46.520 --> 51:48.800
They'll have to stop there
to apply their Law.

51:48.800 --> 51:51.720
It's our chance. We have to go down today.

51:51.720 --> 51:53.000
[alert sounds]

51:56.880 --> 51:59.080
- [Perempuán] That plan of yours is crazy.
- Enjoy the ride!

51:59.080 --> 52:01.200
- What if it doesn't work?
- I don't know if it'll work.

52:01.200 --> 52:04.240
But I know what will happen
if Dagin Babi reaches us.

52:04.240 --> 52:05.960
- [alert sounds]
- [platform whirring]

52:05.960 --> 52:07.800
Yeah! That's what you get! [cackles]

52:07.800 --> 52:10.480
[tied man moaning]

52:10.480 --> 52:12.840
[suspenseful music playing]

52:13.640 --> 52:15.960
Shouldn't we take him with us?

52:21.920 --> 52:22.840
[alert sounds]

52:31.960 --> 52:34.640
[tied man choking]

52:34.640 --> 52:37.440
- [music building]
- [man, above] Got what he deserved.

52:45.640 --> 52:46.840
[alert sounds]

52:55.360 --> 52:56.400
[platform clatters]

52:58.040 --> 52:59.840
- [sighs shakily]
- [Babi] Get off.

53:16.600 --> 53:18.400
[tied man moaning below]

53:21.400 --> 53:24.800
I've been told extraordinary things
about you.

53:25.320 --> 53:29.040
Yes. About your determination
to take part in a pacification,

53:29.040 --> 53:30.680
even though it didn't concern you.

53:32.920 --> 53:36.520
As a reward, today you'll be able to drink
as much wine as you want

53:36.520 --> 53:38.200
while eating your dishes.

53:43.480 --> 53:46.280
- Come on. Don't be shy.
- [cellmate crying softly]

53:46.280 --> 53:48.720
[Babi] Eating is not just a right.
It's a duty.

53:48.720 --> 53:52.600
We need strong men
and women to defend the Law.

53:52.600 --> 53:55.160
[tied man crying out below]

53:59.400 --> 54:00.400
Enjoy.

54:02.840 --> 54:04.160
[cellmate sniffles]

54:06.640 --> 54:09.120
- [whistles]
- [Loyalists clamoring]

54:10.160 --> 54:11.360
Let me go.

54:11.960 --> 54:13.440
- Let me go.
- [alert sounds]

54:14.680 --> 54:15.600
[Perempuán] Let me go!

54:15.600 --> 54:17.960
- Let me go!
- [blond Loyalist] What is this?

54:17.960 --> 54:19.160
Get off me!

54:19.160 --> 54:20.800
- Please.
- [Perempuán gasps]

54:21.400 --> 54:23.000
We must obey the Law.

54:23.600 --> 54:25.360
And be sure to enforce it.

54:25.880 --> 54:27.240
Always.

54:27.240 --> 54:28.840
Without exception.

54:29.360 --> 54:32.360
You know the Rule of the Next Four, right?

54:32.880 --> 54:34.520
Yes, of course you know it.

54:34.520 --> 54:36.160
If you know it, then tell me.

54:36.680 --> 54:40.400
Why the fuck did you let them
take part in the pacification?

54:40.400 --> 54:43.200
[bearded Loyalist, muffled]
I tried to stop them. They didn't let me!

54:43.200 --> 54:44.520
[Babi] Pardon?

54:44.520 --> 54:45.520
[blond Loyalist] I...

54:46.400 --> 54:48.680
I... I told them that it wasn't right.

54:49.440 --> 54:51.200
But you did nothing to stop them.

54:51.200 --> 54:55.120
No, but I stood my ground, so the chain
of communication wasn't lost at any time.

54:55.120 --> 54:59.160
Sure. Even a blind man can see
how brave you are for doing so.

55:03.120 --> 55:04.040
I have an idea.

55:04.040 --> 55:05.280
Today's impossible,

55:05.280 --> 55:09.320
but tomorrow you can drink
all the wine you want too, all right?

55:11.720 --> 55:14.200
All the wine
to wash down your last dinner.

55:14.720 --> 55:18.800
After that, you'll be executed
for the double dereliction of your duties.

55:18.800 --> 55:21.560
But... [muffled]
What do you mean, double dereliction?

55:21.560 --> 55:22.840
- I--
- Yes, double dereliction.

55:22.840 --> 55:27.920
First, you didn't go down when you had to.
And second, you let them do it.

55:28.960 --> 55:30.760
You also let them go down.

55:32.360 --> 55:33.960
So you will lose an arm.

55:34.480 --> 55:36.080
[grunts] And her?

55:36.080 --> 55:39.120
Tell me why only me and not her!

55:41.200 --> 55:44.840
Didn't you tell me she was fooled by you?
She didn't know she was breaking the Law.

55:44.840 --> 55:48.160
[timidly] But, um, having more people
seemed right to me.

55:58.280 --> 55:59.960
One does not interpret the Law!

55:59.960 --> 56:00.880
One obeys it!

56:00.880 --> 56:02.880
[young woman breathing shakily]

56:02.880 --> 56:06.440
[Babi] The exception of the righteous
is the excuse of the disloyal.

56:09.160 --> 56:10.680
You committed an offense.

56:10.680 --> 56:12.280
You'll lose an arm.

56:13.520 --> 56:15.360
You can't punish those who obey the Law!

56:15.360 --> 56:17.640
No. No, no, no, no. You're wrong.

56:17.640 --> 56:19.680
He who breaches the Law
does not defend it.

56:20.920 --> 56:23.280
Furthermore, he who acts like that

56:23.280 --> 56:27.600
will sooner or later interpret the Law
according to his own interests.

56:27.600 --> 56:28.640
Listen to me.

56:29.320 --> 56:33.520
Many people have died
or lost a lot to arrive at this day.

56:35.080 --> 56:37.800
- I lost my eyes.
- [Perempuán grunting]

56:40.760 --> 56:43.600
And your friend should know
what it's like to lose something.

56:45.440 --> 56:47.440
[cellmate sobbing]

56:48.080 --> 56:51.200
Though it appears you...
you haven't learned your lesson.

56:51.200 --> 56:52.320
Yes.

56:52.320 --> 56:54.360
You have committed your second offense.

56:57.720 --> 56:59.960
And now you deserve
the same fate as your dead friend.

56:59.960 --> 57:01.160
[Perempuán] No! Motherfucker!

57:01.160 --> 57:04.400
[Babi] None of this is arbitrary.
Absolutely nothing.

57:04.400 --> 57:07.320
We kill to build a future
where no one will kill anymore.

57:07.320 --> 57:09.160
There are Barbarians down there.

57:09.160 --> 57:11.920
And only fear subdues beasts.

57:12.440 --> 57:15.320
And terror... is the message.

57:15.320 --> 57:18.000
[creaking resonates]

57:18.000 --> 57:20.880
[young man] If you let her live,
she'll escape.

57:25.640 --> 57:27.320
[cellmate panting]

57:32.920 --> 57:34.160
[Babi] Speak, son.

57:35.040 --> 57:36.400
They have a plan.

57:37.400 --> 57:38.720
Tell me about it.

57:39.480 --> 57:42.440
I heard their talk
about stuff that's important.

57:42.440 --> 57:44.360
They thought I was sleeping.

57:44.360 --> 57:46.160
But I wasn't.

57:46.160 --> 57:50.200
Because I know being awake
is the best way to learn things.

57:50.200 --> 57:53.520
And she talked about the place

57:53.520 --> 57:56.520
where this world
is created again and again.

57:56.520 --> 57:59.160
And she told her that if they ate a dog,

57:59.160 --> 58:01.680
they could wake up
from the dream and escape.

58:01.680 --> 58:05.320
And they wanted to kidnap me,
but I don't eat dog.

58:09.000 --> 58:11.080
[group laughing]

58:19.880 --> 58:21.640
- Shh!
- [laughter stops]

58:21.640 --> 58:23.720
[intense music rises]

58:27.840 --> 58:30.320
Calm down, son. Hmm?

58:31.080 --> 58:32.920
Nobody will eat any dog.

58:33.800 --> 58:35.240
[muffled clamoring]

58:36.240 --> 58:37.760
[cellmate's cries echoing]

58:42.560 --> 58:44.080
[screams]

58:46.440 --> 58:47.960
[alert sounds]

58:47.960 --> 58:49.680
[cellmate shrieking]

58:50.320 --> 58:51.520
[cries out]

58:52.600 --> 58:54.200
[frantic screaming]

59:01.840 --> 59:03.880
[bones cracking]

59:03.880 --> 59:05.480
[sounds distort]

59:09.240 --> 59:10.920
[shrieking in pain]

59:19.280 --> 59:22.160
[mournful music building]

59:33.040 --> 59:34.800
[screaming inaudibly]

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:06.880
[children cheering with excitement]

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:13.240
[kids clamoring]

01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:23.840
[screaming]

01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:33.720
- [cries of children fade]
- [indistinct chatter]

<i>But to me, that risk and that boldness,</i>

01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:42.120
<i>was what made it really special.</i>

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:44.960
I refused to let them establish
a safety perimeter.

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.080
<i>The kid wouldn't stop running.</i>

01:11:52.160 --> 01:11:53.640
Until he stumbled.

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:56.360
<i>One of the claws...</i>

01:11:58.520 --> 01:11:59.960
<i>One of the blades...</i>

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:05.600
went through his eye.

01:12:12.200 --> 01:12:14.200
<i>I'd like to think he didn't suffer.</i>

01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:18.400
<i>That he died quickly.</i>

01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:32.800
<i>The lawyers did a good job.</i>

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:39.080
<i>The judge saw it as an accident.</i>

01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:42.880
<i>The insurance company paid.</i>

01:12:45.720 --> 01:12:49.400
<i>And I became one of the most valued
artists of my generation.</i>

01:12:52.200 --> 01:12:54.880
<i>All the pieces of animal brutality</i>

01:12:55.680 --> 01:12:57.680
<i>were sold for millions.</i>

01:12:59.480 --> 01:13:01.280
<i>Especially the dog.</i>

01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:05.280
[man in sunglasses] Barbarians!

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:07.000
- Go for the ankles!
- [shouts]

01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.320
[Barbarians] Go for the ankles!

01:13:08.320 --> 01:13:11.680
[man in sunglasses]
Let the revolution begin!

01:13:11.680 --> 01:13:13.800
- [man 1] Here it comes!
- [bearded man] Be ready!

01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:15.400
[man in sunglasses] Now or never!

01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:17.480
[Barbarians chanting aggressively]

01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.400
[sounds become muffled]

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:32.320
Barbarians, right now!

01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:34.760
[all clamoring]

01:14:07.720 --> 01:14:08.800
[Perempuán cries out]

01:14:31.880 --> 01:14:34.160
[mournful music playing]

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:41.160
- [clamoring resumes]
- [Perempuán screams]

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:43.800
[man 2] Kill them! Kill them all!

01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:45.840
[intense, rhythmic music playing]

01:14:50.240 --> 01:14:51.720
[cries out]

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:52.920
[gasps]

01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:04.400
[straining]

01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:09.480

01:15:20.760 --> 01:15:23.080
- [gasps]
- [silence falls]

01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.120
[weakly] The painting.

01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:31.120
Why is it so important?

01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:42.000
[Babi moans]

01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:47.080
[clamoring fading slowly]

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:53.960
[screams inaudibly]

01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:56.760
[knife scrapes]

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.560
[platform whirring]

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:10.640
[gentle, ethereal music playing]

01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:21.720
[knife scrapes]

01:16:23.320 --> 01:16:25.840
[Babi moaning]

01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:48.000
[Perempuán grunts]

01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:52.800
[Babi] You.

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:56.760
[weakly] Finish what you started. Come on.

01:16:57.560 --> 01:17:01.640
You're defenseless, and I have a knife.

01:17:02.520 --> 01:17:03.480
[Babi exhales]

01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.600
[gently] But I think I have a better idea.

01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:12.000
I could heal your wounds

01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:16.360
and feed you for the rest of your days
with your own flesh.

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:20.440
I would slice it carefully
so you could go on living.

01:17:21.240 --> 01:17:24.120
That way, you'd be worthy of your master.

01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:32.760
But I won't do it.

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:36.880
I won't use my imagination
to torture anyone.

01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:39.320
[Babi] You don't need to.

01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:43.480
You have already condemned us all.

01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:50.280
[Perempuán] <i>They told me
the dog was dangerous.</i>

01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:53.640
But I still went ahead anyway.

01:17:55.840 --> 01:17:57.720
<i>If I could turn back time...</i>

01:17:57.720 --> 01:17:59.000
<i>To save him.</i>

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.040
But it's not possible.

01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:04.760
What are you looking for here?

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:06.640
Time.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.600
<i>I need time to forgive myself.</i>

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:24.160
<i>I need to escape.</i>

01:18:24.160 --> 01:18:25.440
[platform whirring]

01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:28.280
[Perempuán] <i>To forget what I did.</i>

01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:31.640
[platform whooshes by]

01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:41.680

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:47.520
[grunts]

01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:54.320
I'm going.

01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:58.880
- Are you staying, or are you coming too?
- [Trimagasi] No.

01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:03.040
This was the best month of my life.

01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:06.880
[Perempuán sniffles]

01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:12.720
[Trimagasi] We're all prisoners
of ourselves.

01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.560
And from that,

01:19:15.880 --> 01:19:17.400
there's no possible escape.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:23.160
[knife clatters]

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.440

[cellmate] <i>When we smell the gas...</i>

01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:43.320
That's the moment.

01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:45.680
[Perempuán] But what's gonna stop us
from sleeping?

01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:48.640
[cellmate] <i>If everything goes well,
they'll think we're dead.</i>

01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:50.280
<i>But we'll wake up.</i>

01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:55.800
We'll let them take us out from the top,
with the corpses, and then...

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.920
[Perempuán exhales softly]

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:04.640
...we'll have to improvise.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:12.720
- [Perempuán] What if it doesn't go well?
- Maybe we'll die.

01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:21.640
