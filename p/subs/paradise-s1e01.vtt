WEBVTT

03:59.322 --> 04:01.532
I woke Jane,
she's coming in to cover for me.

04:02.033 --> 04:04.035
You woke that poor girl up
and told her to come in early

04:04.118 --> 04:05.620
so you could go home and take a shit?

04:05.703 --> 04:07.163
They're the ones who wanted equality.

04:07.247 --> 04:08.957
-Billy.
-Mm, she was cool.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.793
-I'll see you.
-Alright.

04:11.876 --> 04:13.127
-Hey.
-Hm?

04:13.211 --> 04:15.713
The world's biggest biceps don't make up
for the world's smallest dick.

04:16.381 --> 04:18.508
That's probably true, boss.
But it doesn't hurt, does it?

04:19.133 --> 04:20.843
-That's your dick I'm talking about.
-I knew you were talking

04:20.927 --> 04:22.136
-about my dick, sir.
-Yeah, yeah.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.725
What page are you on?

04:27.809 --> 04:29.435
-Eighty-eight.
-Nice.

04:30.979 --> 04:33.481
I was gonna make
you guys pancakes, Presley.

04:33.564 --> 04:35.191
Yeah, well, you snooze, you lose.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.276
We're having eggs.

04:36.901 --> 04:37.944
You're having egg whites.

04:38.569 --> 04:40.863
Egg whites aren't food. They're air.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.491
Yeah, well, your metabolism
isn't what it was.

04:43.574 --> 04:46.244
I'm sorry, you trying
to tell me I'm getting old?

04:46.327 --> 04:48.746
No, trying to tell you
you're getting chubby.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.748
Child, please, you know I look good.

04:51.332 --> 04:53.334
-Eat some egg whites.
-Uh...

04:53.876 --> 04:54.877
Hey, man, you hear this?

04:55.878 --> 04:57.922
-Well, I got yellow eggs.
-Gimme some.

04:58.006 --> 04:59.132
Ow.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.553
Thank you for making breakfast, baby.

05:04.053 --> 05:05.138
Mm-hmm, you're welcome.

05:10.310 --> 05:11.352
Ugh.

05:16.149 --> 05:19.235
-Didn't sleep?
-Mm, stop worrying about me.

05:19.319 --> 05:21.487
I'll stop worrying about you
when you sleep.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.072
I'll sleep when you stop
worrying about me.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.241
-And around we go.
-Mm-hmm.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.745
Your brother's bike got left out
in the front lawn again.

05:29.412 --> 05:31.080
-Take it out my paycheck.
-Hey.

05:32.582 --> 05:34.667
Sorry. I'll keep an eye on it.

05:35.918 --> 05:38.129
Mm! And don't forget,
my debate final is at 3:00.

05:38.212 --> 05:39.630
Three o'clock, wouldn't miss it.

05:39.714 --> 05:41.466
-I will clock out early.
-Ah!

05:41.549 --> 05:43.676
-Uh-oh.
-I just made you eggs over there.

05:43.760 --> 05:45.011
Well, see, it's my house, so...

05:45.094 --> 05:46.596
my eggs.

05:47.388 --> 05:48.973
And remember, you may be all grown,

05:49.515 --> 05:52.101
but to me, you're still just
a scrawny little thing...

05:52.185 --> 05:54.354
-Mm-hmm.
-...that squeals like a baby every time

05:54.437 --> 05:55.730
-she gets tickled in that one spot...
-Okay, no, no.

05:55.813 --> 05:57.648
-...underneath her right arm.
-I don't wanna be tickled right now.

05:57.732 --> 05:58.858
Oh, no tickling, no tickling.

05:58.941 --> 06:00.526
-Please, please, please.
-Okay, okay.

06:01.569 --> 06:02.570
Okay.

06:03.488 --> 06:04.864
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

06:04.333 --> 06:05.334
Hey, Carl.

06:06.043 --> 06:07.461
A little chilly this morning, huh?

06:06.657 --> 06:09.035
Boy, what on earth are you reading, man?

06:08.045 --> 06:09.255
It'll warm up soon.

06:09.744 --> 06:10.995
James and the Giant Peach.

06:10.506 --> 06:11.757
Always does.

06:12.955 --> 06:15.458
-Where'd you get that?
-Presley gave it to me.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.086
-It's about a--
-I know what it's about.

06:25.968 --> 06:28.596
Uh, hey, if you, uh,

06:28.679 --> 06:32.058
run into Andrew Bloch today,
just try your best to ignore him, okay?

06:35.395 --> 06:36.437
Hey, Dad.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.147
-Hm?
-You good?

06:40.775 --> 06:41.901
Yeah, sorry.

06:40.828 --> 06:41.829
Morning.

06:43.444 --> 06:45.029
Sorry, J. Um,

06:45.822 --> 06:46.948
Dad didn't sleep well.

06:48.741 --> 06:49.992
You like the book?

06:50.618 --> 06:51.786
Yeah.

06:51.869 --> 06:54.288
It's about a boy
who used to have these magic beans,

06:54.372 --> 06:57.250
but he tripped and dropped
all the magic beans into the grass.

06:57.333 --> 06:58.626
-Mm.
-And they went down,

06:58.709 --> 07:00.503
and they got to touch
all these centipedes,

07:00.586 --> 07:02.755
and spiders, and ladybugs.

07:02.839 --> 07:05.425
And even the big tree...

07:09.762 --> 07:10.763
Jane.

07:11.931 --> 07:14.392
-Boss.
-You're here early.

07:14.475 --> 07:16.727
Uh, Billy had something
to take care of at home.

07:16.811 --> 07:17.979
He went home to take a dump.

07:18.688 --> 07:20.022
Yeah, well...

07:19.950 --> 07:21.410
Breathing pretty heavy there, old man.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.483
You're allowed to tell him no.

07:21.493 --> 07:22.953
I'm breathing just fine.

07:23.037 --> 07:24.580
You sure? How's that left arm?

07:23.443 --> 07:24.735
I'm aware.

07:24.663 --> 07:27.041
Is that going numb on you?
Smelling any toast?

07:24.819 --> 07:26.946
-Brooks and Rainey inside?
-Waiting on you.

07:27.124 --> 07:28.292
'Cause we got some baby aspirin here.

07:28.375 --> 07:29.543
I can get you on down to the hospital.

07:29.627 --> 07:33.130
You talk a lot of shit for someone
who runs a 14-minute mile, Agent Pace.

07:33.214 --> 07:35.841
'Cause I lift, dude.
When the bad guys come,

07:35.925 --> 07:37.551
you can run away, I can choke 'em out.

07:37.635 --> 07:39.261
-Ah.
-Who's the hero?

07:39.345 --> 07:41.847
-Gym muscle ain't real muscle, Billy.
-That's so weird though, right?

07:41.931 --> 07:43.474
I guess we're both imagining that one.

07:45.267 --> 07:46.685
-Quiet night?
-Pin drop.

07:46.769 --> 07:48.729
Brooks and Rainey
had the perimeter all night.

07:48.812 --> 07:50.231
I'm clocking out early, by the way.

07:50.314 --> 07:52.358
Garcia gave me
this nasty-ass soup last night

07:52.441 --> 07:54.193
and I gotta go see a man about a horse.

07:54.276 --> 07:55.277
Gotcha.

07:54.515 --> 07:55.516
Boss.

07:55.361 --> 07:58.239
Like a-- like a mutant horse.

07:57.894 --> 07:59.312
-Quiet night, I hear?
-Yes, sir.

07:59.395 --> 08:00.855
Bedroom door was sealed by 10:00.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.356
He's still not up.

08:03.816 --> 08:06.444
-It's late for him.
-Sure it won't be long.

08:07.320 --> 08:08.321
Very good.

08:08.404 --> 08:10.281
-I'm on.
-We're off.

08:10.364 --> 08:12.617
We've got perimeter
for another hour, if you need anything.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.377
Mr. President?

09:06.629 --> 09:09.632
Mr. President, it's almost 8 a.m.
Just checking in.

09:22.645 --> 09:24.146
Mr. President, I'm coming in.

09:42.081 --> 09:43.791
Agent Collins, come on in.

09:48.045 --> 09:49.380
Shoes off, please.

09:53.092 --> 09:54.176
I'm fucking with you.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.053
I just like to see what people will do.

09:56.137 --> 09:57.597
Got the last guy to sit on the floor.

09:58.973 --> 10:01.058
Go on, have a seat.

10:05.021 --> 10:07.857
I assume, uh, you know why you're here.

10:07.940 --> 10:10.610
Um, I have a sense, sir.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.820
Can I get you a water, soda, anything?

10:12.903 --> 10:13.904
I'm fine, sir.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.949
You want any booze? We got it all.

10:18.492 --> 10:19.493
No, thank you.

10:20.077 --> 10:21.787
Yeah, that was a test.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.123
-Yes.
-You passed.

10:24.749 --> 10:25.750
Yes, sir.

10:25.833 --> 10:28.252
Can't have a potential new lead agent
drinking on the job, you know?

10:28.336 --> 10:30.379
Of course.

10:32.256 --> 10:33.591
Well, I'm gonna have a drink.

10:34.300 --> 10:35.676
Little hair of the dog.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.387
Don't worry,
this is not an everyday thing.

10:39.263 --> 10:42.767
-We had quite a night last night.
-Congratulations, sir.

10:42.850 --> 10:43.934
Yeah, yeah.

10:45.519 --> 10:48.064
The other guy literally had the IQ
of a Goldendoodle.

10:48.147 --> 10:51.025
An incumbent president
barely beats a Goldendoodle.

10:51.108 --> 10:53.778
I wouldn't say that's exactly
my one shining moment.

10:56.238 --> 10:58.240
It's a college basketball reference.

10:59.450 --> 11:00.451
One Shining Moment?

11:00.534 --> 11:02.119
It's a song they play
at the end of the tournament.

11:03.162 --> 11:04.163
Yes.

11:06.457 --> 11:09.043
Alright, cards on the table.

11:09.126 --> 11:10.378
I beat a Goldendoodle,

11:10.461 --> 11:12.672
so it looks like I got the gig
for another four years

11:12.755 --> 11:14.924
until I get to retire somewhere beautiful

11:15.925 --> 11:17.635
and lie on a pool float
the rest of my days.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.512
Now, keep in mind, I'll be an ex-president

11:20.054 --> 11:21.555
in just my early 50s.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.266
So, I'm gonna find
the biggest mansion I can,

11:24.350 --> 11:27.228
and I'm gonna fill it with the best booze
and the best art available,

11:27.311 --> 11:30.189
and I'm gonna spend four
to five decades on that pool float.

11:30.272 --> 11:34.151
Unless, of course,
somebody shoots me first.

11:34.860 --> 11:36.862
I'm looking for someone
to make sure I don't get shot,

11:37.530 --> 11:39.156
so I can make it to that pool float.

11:39.240 --> 11:41.701
-You follow?
-I follow.

11:44.620 --> 11:46.580
You got any questions for me?

11:47.707 --> 11:48.708
No, sir.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.422
Jesus Christ, this is like the worst
first date I've ever had.

11:54.505 --> 11:56.549
Come on, ask me a question, will you?

12:00.553 --> 12:01.804
Why the change, sir?

12:03.013 --> 12:05.057
I know Agent Monroe.
He's as good as it gets.

12:05.141 --> 12:07.727
He's a bore, and he's old.

12:08.394 --> 12:10.855
If my lead agent
isn't gonna be fun to be around,

12:10.938 --> 12:12.982
I'd like to at least know
he can lift heavy stuff.

12:15.985 --> 12:18.612
Look, I'm looking
for someone to be by my side

12:18.696 --> 12:19.739
for the next four years,

12:19.822 --> 12:22.032
and potentially into my pool float years.

12:22.116 --> 12:23.784
As you know, they let us
keep light protection

12:23.868 --> 12:25.453
even after we leave the big house.

12:26.620 --> 12:28.539
They gave me a list and a batch of names.

12:28.622 --> 12:30.666
I looked at that list and batch of names,

12:31.500 --> 12:32.543
I asked to meet with you.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.924
"Why, sir?
Why did you ask to meet with me?"

12:39.008 --> 12:41.761
That's a great question, Agent Collins,
I'm so happy you asked.

12:42.428 --> 12:43.554
I--

12:43.637 --> 12:45.306
I promise this is not a regular thing.

12:46.557 --> 12:52.104
Well, in answer to the question
that you didn't ask,

12:52.188 --> 12:53.856
I hear you're the best of the best.

12:54.690 --> 12:57.067
I feel pretty confident
you can lift heavy stuff.

12:58.068 --> 12:59.695
And it doesn't hurt that you're Black.

13:01.363 --> 13:02.782
I'm supposed to be a Southern progressive

13:02.865 --> 13:05.659
but I got a bunch of white guys
surrounding me everywhere I go.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.412
So, I'm here 'cause I'm Black?

13:09.079 --> 13:10.539
You're here because you're good.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.667
And the other guy was boring and old.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.462
It just doesn't hurt that you're Black.

13:18.798 --> 13:21.175
-Does my directness bother you?
-No, sir.

13:22.676 --> 13:24.011
But...

13:25.304 --> 13:26.305
No, sir.

13:28.098 --> 13:29.099
There was a "but."

13:30.768 --> 13:32.561
I just wonder if having
a Black man guarding you

13:32.645 --> 13:35.356
is really the progressive visual
you think it is?

13:35.439 --> 13:36.732
That's a fair point.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.027
Well, my Secretary of State

13:40.110 --> 13:42.404
and my Secretary of Defense
are also Black.

13:43.781 --> 13:46.992
But they don't stand next to me
when I kiss babies, so...

13:50.204 --> 13:55.334
Agent Collins, I went from being
one of the richest men in the world

13:55.417 --> 13:58.337
to a one-term, now two-term president
almost overnight.

13:58.420 --> 14:00.464
I drink whiskey in the middle
of the Oval Office.

14:01.131 --> 14:03.676
And I'm upfront about telling
a potential new lead agent

14:03.759 --> 14:05.261
that part of the reason
he's appealing to me

14:05.344 --> 14:06.887
is the color of his skin.

14:06.971 --> 14:09.139
I did not get here
by doing things by the book.

14:10.307 --> 14:13.269
I couldn't tell you who the eighth
vice president of the United States was

14:13.352 --> 14:15.688
and I'm not really sure
where Syria is on a map.

14:17.648 --> 14:19.316
But people seem to like me.

14:20.359 --> 14:22.486
And leaders of other countries
seem to trust me.

14:24.488 --> 14:29.034
The world is 19 times more fucked
than anyone realizes.

14:31.745 --> 14:33.664
And if someone's gotta sit in that chair
and do the unthinkable,

14:33.747 --> 14:35.958
I consider myself a reasonable
and decent human being

14:36.041 --> 14:37.710
who will try to do the right thing.

14:40.087 --> 14:42.506
Hopefully, that's someone
you wouldn't mind taking a bullet for...

14:43.507 --> 14:44.842
if this thing goes your way.

14:48.470 --> 14:49.597
Yes, sir.

14:53.517 --> 14:54.685
Okey-dokey.

14:55.811 --> 14:57.271
Thank you for coming in.

14:57.354 --> 14:59.023
We will be in touch.

15:06.530 --> 15:07.865
Southwestern Asia, sir.

15:08.741 --> 15:10.743
-I'm sorry?
-Syria.

15:10.826 --> 15:12.578
It's in Southwest Asia
on the eastern coast

15:12.661 --> 15:14.330
of the Mediterranean Sea.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.458
No shit? Huh.

15:18.792 --> 15:20.210
And the eighth vice president?

15:20.836 --> 15:21.962
Martin Van Buren.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.256
Obviously, I knew that.

15:25.382 --> 15:27.134
It's a test, you know,
like with the whiskey.

15:28.260 --> 15:29.428
Of course, sir.

15:29.511 --> 15:33.098
Marsha, could you inform the cabinet
that Syria is not in Canada?

15:33.182 --> 15:34.934
We've been getting it wrong
this whole time.

15:37.102 --> 15:38.604
I'm the funniest president.

15:38.687 --> 15:39.813
Yeah.

16:58.225 --> 16:59.435
All good up there, boss?

17:02.187 --> 17:03.856
Yeah-- Uh, no.

17:03.939 --> 17:05.357
Hang on, I need a second.

17:08.110 --> 17:09.111
Sir?

17:11.697 --> 17:15.367
Jane, I need you to lock down
and sweep the residence.

17:15.451 --> 17:16.702
No one in, no one out.

17:16.785 --> 17:18.829
-What's going on?
-Just give me a minute.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.919
Jane, who's in the bay right now?

17:26.003 --> 17:28.797
-Garcia.
-Garcia, okay, good.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.175
Sir, if we're locking down,
shouldn't I be alerting Robinson?

17:31.258 --> 17:32.760
No! Not yet.

17:32.843 --> 17:33.844
But protocol says--

17:33.927 --> 17:37.014
Jane, I need you
to quietly lock this place down

17:37.097 --> 17:40.059
for the next 30 minutes without
asking any more questions.

17:40.934 --> 17:44.021
Only person allowed upstairs is Billy.

17:44.104 --> 17:45.856
Billy's not here, remember?

17:45.939 --> 17:48.108
-He will be.
-Copy that.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.986
You're freaking me out a little bit, boss.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.988
Copy that. Thirty minutes.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.244
Agent Collins.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.246
Yes, sir?

18:01.330 --> 18:03.540
Enjoying your first week with us so far?

18:03.624 --> 18:04.917
Yes, sir, thank you.

18:06.543 --> 18:07.795
Okay, okay, that's good to hear.

18:09.922 --> 18:11.381
That's very good to hear.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.260
You're married, right?

18:16.011 --> 18:18.138
-Yes, sir.
-I noticed your ring.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.350
You got kids?

18:22.392 --> 18:26.105
Yes, sir, a-a girl named Presley
and a boy named James.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.024
Presley?

18:29.108 --> 18:31.735
My wife's from Memphis.
Couldn't be stopped.

18:34.696 --> 18:36.198
You gonna have any more?

18:37.074 --> 18:38.075
No, sir.

18:38.659 --> 18:39.785
I'd love to, but...

18:41.912 --> 18:42.955
No, sir.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.963
Well, I'm relatively confident...

18:51.046 --> 18:54.466
that the First Lady
voted for the other guy last week.

18:56.093 --> 18:59.763
If true, I imagine
that's the first time in history

18:59.847 --> 19:02.432
that a sitting First Lady
voted against her own husband.

19:04.560 --> 19:05.561
Yeah.

19:07.604 --> 19:10.691
Not the biggest fan of mine
of late, my wife.

19:15.362 --> 19:16.405
You don't approve?

19:17.573 --> 19:18.740
Those things will kill you.

19:19.533 --> 19:20.576
Yeah, well...

19:23.453 --> 19:24.830
they can get in line.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.876
She will take the kid...

19:30.419 --> 19:32.796
and leave me the second I'm out of office.

19:36.258 --> 19:38.385
How come your wife
doesn't want more kids, huh?

19:39.761 --> 19:41.013
Were the first two lemons?

19:42.014 --> 19:43.599
You a shit father? What's the deal?

19:46.185 --> 19:48.896
Come on, man. I'm sad, I'm tipsy.

19:48.979 --> 19:50.189
I could use a story.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.985
It's not much of a story, sir.

19:55.861 --> 19:59.323
Um, my wife, Teri, she's a scientist.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.909
We met when I was at the Academy

20:01.992 --> 20:04.328
and she wants to focus on her career now.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.915
She's starting a new project in Atlanta
and she'll have to travel.

20:07.998 --> 20:11.460
So... we're stopping at two.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.296
They keep us plenty busy, as is.

20:17.216 --> 20:18.217
Hey.

20:19.760 --> 20:20.844
No, thank you.

20:22.679 --> 20:24.139
He passes again.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.311
Well, Xavier, for what it's worth,

20:29.394 --> 20:31.980
you're probably better off
not having any more kids.

20:35.359 --> 20:36.652
Smart move right now.

20:40.155 --> 20:44.243
It's definitely a very... very smart move.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.871
I'm not sure I understand, sir.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.748
That'll be all, Agent Collins.

20:51.708 --> 20:52.709
Yes, sir.

21:20.445 --> 21:22.239
This better be good, boss.

21:22.322 --> 21:24.074
Garcia's soup is doing
a number on me right now.

21:24.157 --> 21:25.450
I need you back at the residence now.

21:26.159 --> 21:28.954
X, I'm in a pretty precarious position
at the moment.

21:29.037 --> 21:30.038
Billy.

21:30.831 --> 21:31.832
Christian Laettner.

21:34.084 --> 21:36.795
I gave us about 30 minutes
before Jane has to call it in,

21:36.878 --> 21:40.340
but once she does, Robinson won't let me
within a mile of this place.

21:41.925 --> 21:44.011
It's bad, Billy. It's really bad.

21:44.094 --> 21:46.013
And I need you here five minutes ago.

21:46.096 --> 21:47.389
Copy you. I'm on my way.

21:47.472 --> 21:49.266
Billy, you step into this thing with me,

21:49.349 --> 21:50.726
you could be entering a world of hurt.

21:50.809 --> 21:51.935
Promise?

21:52.019 --> 21:53.729
Five minutes ago. Move.

21:53.812 --> 21:54.855
House all clear.

21:54.938 --> 21:56.356
All non-essentials are out.

21:56.440 --> 21:57.899
-Study? Guest house?
-Secured.

21:57.983 --> 21:59.693
-Sir--
-I need five with Garcia.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.576
-Mike.
-Mm.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.202
Hey, what's good, boss?

22:09.286 --> 22:11.663
Jane says we're on a lockdown
that's not a lockdown. What's the deal?

22:11.747 --> 22:14.041
I need you to take me
through yesterday's log.

22:14.833 --> 22:17.127
Oh, yeah, sure thing. Gimme a sec.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.882
By the way, I don't know what you heard,
but I didn't make soup.

22:21.965 --> 22:23.592
I made pozole, and my stuff's legit.

22:25.260 --> 22:26.678
If Billy has a stomach
like a 14-year-old Amish girl,

22:26.762 --> 22:28.597
-that's his problem--
-Hey, Mike, I need you to focus.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.350
Okay, we're up.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.810
Take me through Wildcat's day.
Anything irregular?

22:34.811 --> 22:36.813
Abnormally early wake-up and workout.

22:37.606 --> 22:38.940
Long workout, actually.

22:39.024 --> 22:42.110
Then, he got out of his bathrobe
for the first time in a week.

22:42.194 --> 22:44.279
He spent the morning
making pasta for his son for dinner.

22:44.821 --> 22:46.573
Made the pasta by hand, by the way.

22:48.116 --> 22:51.370
Had coffee with Sinatra
in the afternoon, back patio.

22:54.164 --> 22:55.624
You were the agent on duty,
you know all this.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.252
What?

22:59.336 --> 23:00.420
Say it to my face.

23:01.213 --> 23:05.550
I want to see what it looks like
when you have balls, sir.

23:07.010 --> 23:09.679
It's fine. We're fine.

23:17.020 --> 23:18.188
And that's it?

23:18.271 --> 23:20.524
Anyone out of the ordinary
on the premises?

23:20.607 --> 23:23.819
Nope. Gardeners, us, the usual.

23:24.694 --> 23:27.406
Kid bailed on him for dinner.
Stayed home with his mom.

23:28.031 --> 23:30.742
Poor guy had to scarf down
dinner for two by himself.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.744
Oh, but on the bright side,

23:33.328 --> 23:35.914
you-know-who made her daily
happy hour appearance.

23:37.707 --> 23:39.543
-Wait, rewind that for me.
-Mm-hmm.

23:43.630 --> 23:44.714
Freeze it.

23:46.174 --> 23:47.259
A little bigger.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.262
A little more.

23:53.515 --> 23:54.516
Okay.

23:56.309 --> 23:59.604
She left, and he took
two long pours downstairs

23:59.688 --> 24:01.189
for drinks with the old man.

24:02.107 --> 24:04.568
Daddy Warbucks returned
to the guest house at 9:30,

24:05.360 --> 24:08.280
and our hero
took a third long pour up to bed.

24:08.989 --> 24:11.032
The door was sealed at 10:04.

24:11.116 --> 24:14.453
Last person to see him was...

24:27.841 --> 24:30.343
You guys shot the shit there
for a while, huh?

24:32.721 --> 24:35.140
That dude has said four words
to me since I got down here.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.350
Well, I guess you earned it.

24:42.105 --> 24:43.106
Mr. President.

24:43.190 --> 24:45.484
-Mr. President.
-Mr. President.

24:45.567 --> 24:47.152
Ladies and gentlemen,
thank you for your patience.

24:47.235 --> 24:48.361
Betsy, I know you missed me.

24:48.445 --> 24:49.654
Why don't you kick us off?

24:49.738 --> 24:52.616
Regarding yesterday's explosive
New York Times report

24:52.699 --> 24:55.494
-about recent revelations in Colorado.
-I have no comment on that.

24:55.577 --> 24:57.829
Due respect, but isn't
some comment required, sir?

24:57.913 --> 25:00.540
There's wild speculation
about what people are seeing there,

25:00.624 --> 25:02.876
and protests are already forming
across the country.

25:02.959 --> 25:05.045
Yes, and I'm sure
the internet's doing a fine job

25:05.128 --> 25:07.964
at, uh, feeding that fire
without me fueling the fire.

25:08.048 --> 25:10.300
Now, what I would like to speak about

25:10.383 --> 25:11.676
is the latest jobs report.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.346
Just one month since my re-election...

25:26.441 --> 25:27.442
Weapon!

25:27.526 --> 25:28.568
-Whoa!
-Get down!

25:30.153 --> 25:31.154
The world deserves to know!

25:31.947 --> 25:33.907
The world deserves to know!

25:42.415 --> 25:43.583
Sir, are you hit?

25:44.793 --> 25:46.795
-Sir, are you hit?
-No, I'm fine.

25:46.878 --> 25:48.296
No, you're hit. Let me see.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.965
-No! Hey, I'm fine, look at me.
-Hey.

25:51.341 --> 25:53.385
It's you. It's your blood.

25:53.468 --> 25:54.469
Huh?

25:57.138 --> 25:58.139
Agent Collins?

25:59.891 --> 26:02.769
Agent Collins? Agent Collins?

26:02.852 --> 26:04.646
-You're not hit?
-Agent Collins?

26:04.729 --> 26:06.231
But you're not hit?

26:22.747 --> 26:23.748
Sir.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.417
Take it easy.

26:27.002 --> 26:28.003
Sir.

26:30.297 --> 26:31.798
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.

26:32.382 --> 26:34.884
You just got--
Hey, you just got out of surgery.

26:34.968 --> 26:36.970
-Sir--
-Your wife-- Your wife's on the way.

26:37.053 --> 26:38.221
They had trouble reaching her.

26:38.305 --> 26:39.889
-Are you alright?
-I'm fine.

26:42.475 --> 26:44.811
You tackle like a high school sophomore,
by the way.

26:46.730 --> 26:50.066
Though I'll admit,
when I saw all that blood,

26:50.150 --> 26:52.027
I thought I'd been Christian Laettner'd.

26:54.195 --> 26:55.363
Oh, don't do this to me.

26:55.447 --> 26:57.240
-Christian Laettner? Duke?
-Hm?

26:57.324 --> 26:59.993
Yeah. He made the most famous
college basketball shot of all time

27:00.076 --> 27:01.661
against us in the tournament.

27:01.745 --> 27:04.748
Single-handedly killed me

27:04.831 --> 27:06.958
and every other
Kentucky Wildcat fan that day.

27:09.044 --> 27:10.920
Yeah, I thought I'd been Laettner'd.

27:12.547 --> 27:13.715
But then, uh...

27:17.427 --> 27:20.430
That was a hell
of a blocked shot, Agent Collins.

27:22.557 --> 27:24.392
Is there anything I can do for you?

27:28.355 --> 27:29.564
I don't know.

27:31.441 --> 27:34.527
Maybe cool it
with the basketball metaphors?

27:40.742 --> 27:42.661
Well, well, well, look at you.

27:44.788 --> 27:47.165
Good for you, Xavier.
You're kind of funny when you're wounded.

27:47.248 --> 27:49.459
-Yeah, who knew?
-Not me.

27:49.542 --> 27:50.835
I'd have shot you weeks ago.

27:56.424 --> 27:57.592
Sir?

28:01.304 --> 28:02.389
Duty calls.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.727
They got the rest of the bullet out
in surgery, by the way.

28:08.561 --> 28:10.980
Your career
as a shoulder model's probably over

28:11.064 --> 28:15.068
but, uh, they tell me you'll make
a full recovery.

28:15.151 --> 28:16.319
Do we know who he was?

28:16.903 --> 28:18.738
Some asshole with a 3D printer.

28:19.739 --> 28:20.740
But we got him.

28:21.366 --> 28:23.284
Well, I'll be back to work
as soon as I clear my physical.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.870
No, no, no, no.
Take a few weeks, paid leave.

28:25.954 --> 28:27.747
-It's not necessary.
-That's an order.

28:27.831 --> 28:30.166
Don't make me do the whole
Commander-in-Chief bullshit, okay?

28:30.250 --> 28:31.626
It's been a long day.

28:32.919 --> 28:33.920
Although, um...

28:36.339 --> 28:38.174
I'd like to talk to you
when you get back...

28:39.092 --> 28:40.093
about the future.

28:41.386 --> 28:43.596
Yes, sir, of course.

28:47.726 --> 28:49.978
Saying "thank you"
feels kinda insufficient.

28:52.355 --> 28:55.108
Saying "just doing my job"
seems kinda lame.

28:57.318 --> 28:58.945
So, we'll just leave it there, huh?

29:01.364 --> 29:02.782
.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.178
Holy fuck.

29:25.430 --> 29:27.056
X, you gotta call this in, man.

29:35.148 --> 29:37.233
Safe was empty. It's gone.

29:38.359 --> 29:39.778
-No.
-Gone.

29:40.904 --> 29:42.363
Someone had to know a lot.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.240
Someone had to have a lot of access.

29:45.033 --> 29:46.826
In a few minutes,
I have to tell Jane to call this in

29:46.910 --> 29:48.244
and we lose control of the whole scene.

29:48.328 --> 29:52.081
Hey, I need you to walk
the entire property right now.

29:52.165 --> 29:54.334
Balcony door's open. You saw the blood.

29:54.417 --> 29:58.004
Check the yard below. No photos, no notes.

29:58.087 --> 30:01.341
Mental snapshots of everything.
It's the little things.

30:01.424 --> 30:03.259
Little things are gonna
matter here, Billy. Copy?

30:03.343 --> 30:05.178
-Copy.
-Go.

30:05.261 --> 30:06.262
-X.
-Go.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.389
Yeah.

30:22.737 --> 30:24.239
Garcia for Collins.

30:26.032 --> 30:27.742
-Go ahead.
-I got something, sir.

30:29.369 --> 30:30.370
On my way.

30:52.267 --> 30:53.601
Billy.

30:54.185 --> 30:55.395
What the hell is going on?

30:55.478 --> 30:56.688
Hold on.

30:59.274 --> 31:00.316
Billy.

31:28.803 --> 31:30.263
-Hey.
-Hey.

31:30.847 --> 31:32.765
What's going on? This a real lockdown?

31:33.766 --> 31:35.393
Beats me. Nobody tells me shit.

31:37.437 --> 31:38.479
Alright, let's go.

31:38.563 --> 31:39.981
Jane might know something.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.324
-What do you got?
-Check it out.

31:52.327 --> 31:55.163
You chat with the president
until just after 10 p.m.

31:55.246 --> 31:57.248
Bedroom door closes at 10:04.

31:57.332 --> 32:01.127
You secure the downstairs
and are relieved by Billy at 10:32.

32:01.210 --> 32:04.088
A night of top-notch
Billy Pace security ensues.

32:08.801 --> 32:11.429
Yeah, the problem is my food,
not that he eats like a filthy animal.

32:11.512 --> 32:12.513
-Mike.
-Yeah.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.515
Come on.

32:14.599 --> 32:17.518
Anyway,
Billy does his rounds, but mainly...

32:20.813 --> 32:22.774
Jesus.

32:22.857 --> 32:24.984
Dude even took
an hour-and-a-half power nap.

32:25.068 --> 32:26.361
Look at him.

32:26.444 --> 32:28.112
-Dead to the world.
-This is what you wanted to show me?

32:28.196 --> 32:29.280
Hang on.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.658
Check out the large
glass picture frame behind him.

32:31.741 --> 32:34.285
-See the reflection from the TV?
-Yeah.

32:34.369 --> 32:36.871
You can see movement
from the screen, but watch.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.832
Now, it freezes,
like someone paused the TV.

32:39.916 --> 32:42.001
But he didn't pause the TV.

32:42.085 --> 32:44.379
So, I checked the other cameras,
and that's when I realized

32:44.462 --> 32:47.048
that from 10:42 until 12:13,

32:47.131 --> 32:50.510
all security cameras were offline,
frozen on the last image.

32:50.593 --> 32:51.844
No one noticed because--

32:51.928 --> 32:53.262
No one else was in the house except Billy

32:53.346 --> 32:55.056
and he was dead to the world
on that couch.

32:55.139 --> 32:56.140
Exactly.

32:56.224 --> 32:58.351
At 12:13, cameras come back online.

32:58.434 --> 32:59.936
-See that?
-Mm-hmm.

33:00.019 --> 33:02.188
A minute later, Billy wakes up.

33:02.271 --> 33:05.024
An hour later, I show up
for my shift with fresh coffee.

33:05.692 --> 33:07.360
-But for all we know--
-Anyone could have entered

33:07.443 --> 33:09.195
or exited during that window.

33:09.278 --> 33:11.531
Yeah, and no one in control
would have noticed,

33:11.614 --> 33:15.368
especially if they were a little young
and a little inexperienced.

33:16.369 --> 33:17.954
Who was in there last night at that time?

33:19.831 --> 33:20.832
Jane.

33:23.334 --> 33:24.711
Hey.

33:24.794 --> 33:26.170
I'm serious. What the fuck is going on?

33:26.254 --> 33:28.297
-Leave it be for a second, please.
-But--

33:28.381 --> 33:30.675
Jane, you need to be
really calm right now.

33:32.552 --> 33:34.804
Everything's gonna be looked at
from here on out.

33:36.681 --> 33:37.890
I need you to trust me.

33:39.308 --> 33:40.309
Okay?

33:42.186 --> 33:43.187
Okay.

33:44.939 --> 33:45.940
Jane.

33:49.444 --> 33:51.487
We're officially under lockdown,
call it in.

33:52.447 --> 33:54.866
Wildcat is down. It's a Code Red.

33:59.287 --> 34:00.329
Call it in, Jane.

34:01.998 --> 34:04.751
Our people only, now.

34:04.834 --> 34:06.002
Yes, sir.

34:11.049 --> 34:12.884
I'm calling in a Code Red.

34:25.188 --> 34:26.731
-What's happening?
-No one's allowed.

34:26.814 --> 34:28.775
What's going on? Who is it, is it Kane?

34:35.531 --> 34:36.532
Please stop stopping me

34:36.616 --> 34:37.742
-from getting into the house.
-I'm sorry.

34:37.825 --> 34:39.077
I get to know
what's going on with my husband.

34:39.160 --> 34:40.203
Is it Cal?

34:54.509 --> 34:55.676
Sam.

34:55.760 --> 34:57.095
Is it Cal?

34:58.137 --> 34:59.180
Where's my husband?!

35:02.809 --> 35:06.020
Is it Cal?!
Let me in, goddammit, Sam!

35:06.104 --> 35:08.064
Site secure, ma'am.
Was going to start interviews.

35:08.147 --> 35:10.399
Yes, please let me know
whatever you find out.

35:11.442 --> 35:13.361
Where is he? Cal?!

35:15.279 --> 35:17.031
-Where's my son?
-Kane.

35:17.115 --> 35:20.034
Why don't we go in the other room?
Let's go in the other room.

35:20.118 --> 35:22.245
-But I want to see Cal.
-Come with me.

35:29.877 --> 35:32.296
Agent Rainey, Agent Garcia, follow me.

35:39.971 --> 35:40.972
Agent Collins.

35:42.181 --> 35:43.266
Yes, sir.

35:55.987 --> 35:57.572
As we said before, Agent Collins,

35:57.655 --> 35:59.907
this line of questioning
is merely a formality,

35:59.991 --> 36:01.951
given you were the last one
to see him alive.

36:02.577 --> 36:03.661
And again, for the record,

36:03.744 --> 36:06.414
you noticed nothing unusual
when he turned in last night?

36:09.333 --> 36:11.544
No, just another night.

36:15.882 --> 36:17.300
Did you speak to him?

36:19.093 --> 36:20.887
I was wondering where you were,
Agent Robinson.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.975
Oh, I'm right here, Agent Collins.

36:30.897 --> 36:32.732
What did you speak
to him about last night?

36:42.116 --> 36:44.911
And so concludes another day in paradise.

36:45.995 --> 36:47.121
Hey.

36:53.711 --> 36:55.838
Oh, I'm feeling that. Hang on.

36:56.380 --> 36:59.675
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.432
-Listening party?
-Will that be all?

37:06.974 --> 37:08.726
Your loss.

37:11.062 --> 37:12.480
Boo.

37:35.169 --> 37:38.673
Ooh, a little light bedtime reading.

37:40.675 --> 37:43.302
Got the news of the world right here.

37:43.386 --> 37:45.554
Step right up, step right up,
come and get it.

37:45.638 --> 37:49.016
Got the news of the world.

37:53.980 --> 37:56.357
Have a drink with me, Xavier, Christ.

37:57.441 --> 37:58.776
We don't talk anymore.

38:00.027 --> 38:02.446
-No, thank you.
-"Sir."

38:04.782 --> 38:09.620
I, I can't remember exactly when it was
when you stopped calling me "sir."

38:09.704 --> 38:10.788
Do you?

38:14.083 --> 38:16.002
Oh, for Christ's sake, speak your mind.

38:16.085 --> 38:18.004
You don't want me to speak my mind.

38:19.171 --> 38:20.339
Sir.

38:32.935 --> 38:34.312
Well, then...

38:36.480 --> 38:38.357
I don't know what else there is to say.

38:48.909 --> 38:51.120
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, I know.

38:51.203 --> 38:52.246
Hey, look.

38:52.330 --> 38:54.999
You're not wrong, Xavier.

38:55.583 --> 38:57.376
What's in here will definitely kill me.

38:59.879 --> 39:01.547
That'll be all, Agent Collins.

39:07.970 --> 39:09.013
Xavier.

39:16.312 --> 39:19.815
Will you ever be able
to forgive me for what happened?

39:22.151 --> 39:23.569
Bring him in.

39:35.289 --> 39:37.208
Agent Collins, welcome back.

39:38.209 --> 39:42.046
Don't speak if you don't have to.
Have a seat.

39:48.844 --> 39:50.888
Agent Collins,
you're about to be entrusted

39:50.971 --> 39:53.891
with top-secret
national security information.

39:53.974 --> 39:56.227
The president has cleared you
at the highest level.

39:56.310 --> 39:59.146
Should you wish to proceed, you will be
one of the few hundred people in the world

39:59.230 --> 40:01.357
privy to this information at this stage.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.610
Agent Collins, do you wish to proceed?

40:08.239 --> 40:10.408
The president
tells me you have children.

40:11.742 --> 40:13.744
Yes, ma'am, that's correct.

40:14.954 --> 40:16.372
You're gonna want to hear this.

40:22.586 --> 40:24.046
Okay.

40:25.214 --> 40:26.882
The tablet within this box

40:26.966 --> 40:31.137
contains all information and data
related to a highly classified project.

40:31.220 --> 40:34.598
It's a fancy way of saying that's
the most important box in the world.

40:36.225 --> 40:38.477
I assume you're aware
of what's going on in Colorado.

40:41.272 --> 40:44.775
Will I ever be able to forgive you
for what happened?

41:03.419 --> 41:06.422
Our kids' names
were a big deal to my wife.

41:08.883 --> 41:11.177
Presley was pretty much
set in stone from go.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.304
But for our second kid, our son...

41:15.473 --> 41:18.767
...every night of that pregnancy,
she would try out a different name.

41:20.561 --> 41:24.273
And then one day,
she was about eight months pregnant,

41:24.356 --> 41:25.983
could hardly walk anymore.

41:26.567 --> 41:30.404
We were in this bookstore together,
and she saw it.

41:31.864 --> 41:34.366
James and the Giant Peach.

41:44.418 --> 41:45.544
And that was it.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.130
She had found our boy's name.

41:51.467 --> 41:53.844
She read the book to her belly every night

41:53.928 --> 41:56.096
for the rest of her pregnancy.

41:56.180 --> 41:58.516
She became obsessed with that damn book.

42:00.017 --> 42:01.018
And then...

42:03.729 --> 42:05.397
you know, after she--

42:08.651 --> 42:10.778
Well, I guess
I became obsessed with it, too.

42:15.658 --> 42:18.661
Yeah, I'm pretty much an expert

42:18.744 --> 42:21.539
on James and the Giant Peach right now.

42:22.122 --> 42:23.791
It was written by Roald Dahl.

42:23.874 --> 42:27.545
And originally, it wasn't
gonna be about a peach.

42:28.337 --> 42:30.047
It was gonna be about a cherry.

42:31.048 --> 42:33.425
But Dahl changed it because he thought

42:33.509 --> 42:36.637
that peaches were squishier.

42:39.056 --> 42:40.474
Strange, isn't it?

42:40.558 --> 42:43.602
Book could have been called
James and the Giant Cherry.

42:51.235 --> 42:53.904
Sometimes I lie in bed
staring at the ceiling,

42:54.572 --> 42:57.449
wondering if my wife would've
wanted to name our son James

42:57.533 --> 43:01.078
if the book were about a giant cherry
and not a giant peach.

43:05.207 --> 43:06.458
But I'll never know.

43:09.044 --> 43:11.839
Obviously, I can't ask her.

43:12.506 --> 43:15.634
"Another Day in Paradise" playing]

43:16.552 --> 43:17.928
-I know.
-Stop.

43:24.018 --> 43:26.061
You want to know if I'll forgive you.

43:28.063 --> 43:30.149
I'll forgive you when I can sleep again.

43:32.443 --> 43:34.361
And I'll sleep again when you're dead.

45:18.424 --> 45:20.050
Now, we cannot divulge specifics,

45:20.134 --> 45:21.301
but what we can tell you

45:21.385 --> 45:24.680
is that we are preparing
for a massive catastrophe

45:24.763 --> 45:26.807
that could cause an extinction-level event
for humanity

45:26.890 --> 45:29.476
in the very near, very real future.

45:29.560 --> 45:33.814
In preparation, we have begun construction
underneath a mountain in Colorado.

45:33.897 --> 45:36.817
When completed, it may be our only chance:

45:36.900 --> 45:38.652
the world's largest underground city.
