03:23.234 --> 03:25.225
We're here all week.

03:25.436 --> 03:29.930
- Contact Boston Center now.
- Ed, Tower wants them out faster.

03:30.174 --> 03:33.575
I've only got so much room.
Airspace is finite.

03:33.778 --> 03:36.440
- Ed's going down the pipes.
- I am not.

03:36.681 --> 03:40.242
You are. It happens when
you use the word "finite."

03:40.718 --> 03:44.381
American 427, heading 210.
Traffic 5:00 above you.

03:44.589 --> 03:49.026
- Correction, below you. No, no!
- Blow you? Blow me, correct.

03:49.594 --> 03:54.622
- Nick, could you take Allegheny 2629?
- Sure, I got room for the whole fleet.

03:54.866 --> 03:57.767
You don't have to take it.
You're full.

03:57.969 --> 04:00.301
- Teamwork.
- Don't be a pain, Pat.

04:00.538 --> 04:02.369
- Off the rubber!
- Get off!

04:02.573 --> 04:06.907
Allegheny 2629 reduce speed
to 180 knots. Altimeter 2992.

04:07.111 --> 04:09.705
One-eighty, 2629.

04:09.981 --> 04:14.975
KLM 3729, three miles southeast bound.
I put him ahead of you. Caution...

04:15.219 --> 04:17.744
...turbulence.
- He's in sight, 3729.

04:18.289 --> 04:22.419
Thanks. Turn 20 degrees left.
I'll keep you on the ILS.

04:23.561 --> 04:27.463
"4 out of 5 dentists surveyed
recommend sugarless gum."

04:27.732 --> 04:31.099
Sugarless gum, sugarless gum,
sugarless...

04:31.302 --> 04:35.796
...gum, gum, gum, income, become...
Continental 962, head 140.

04:36.074 --> 04:37.632

04:37.842 --> 04:40.970
American 7736, contact
Newark tower, 118.3.

04:41.179 --> 04:44.637
- Thanks.
- You do good work. American 7736.

04:44.849 --> 04:48.580
- I need more planes to stay interested.
- I'll be damned.

04:48.786 --> 04:52.984
- Continental 428, descend to 5000.
- 6 to 5. Continental 428.

04:53.257 --> 04:57.353
- Continental 961, go to Robbinsville.
- To Robbinsville.

04:57.595 --> 04:59.358
He shoots. He scores.

05:00.932 --> 05:06.097
It's sleek, it's crisp.
Is that crisp vectoring or what?

05:06.637 --> 05:09.504
I got them lined up like Rockettes.

05:27.625 --> 05:31.117
- You think Tina looks good lately?
- Too muscular.

05:31.329 --> 05:35.163
- We see her every day.
- It'd be like sex with your wife.

05:40.872 --> 05:43.841
- Extra-crispy makes me ill.
- I'll take them.

05:44.041 --> 05:47.807
- I want a side of berries.
- White toast for me.

05:48.012 --> 05:51.641
- Whatever toast you got.
- No butter, wheat toast.

05:51.849 --> 05:55.080
- I gotta start again.
- Not to worry there, Kim.

05:55.319 --> 05:59.585
Everybody loses the picture sometimes.
Take the weight off.

05:59.857 --> 06:03.884
Don't worry, he bails us out too.
She was gonna sit here.

06:04.896 --> 06:07.888
Two eggs easy, crisp bacon,
browns, wheat.

06:08.099 --> 06:10.897
A 3-egg ham and cheddar,
no onion, rye.

06:11.102 --> 06:13.593
A 3-egg sunny, tall buttermilk...

06:13.871 --> 06:17.170
...pigs, browns, double white
and side berries.

06:17.375 --> 06:22.506
Move it! Strive for greatness.
I'm a restaurant critic for The Times.

06:29.854 --> 06:33.688
Pardon me. Would you join us
until something opens up?

06:33.925 --> 06:37.361
- We'll wait.
- My mother'd be ashamed of me sitting.

06:37.562 --> 06:40.793
She'll have a heart attack if I tell her.

06:41.032 --> 06:43.557
I think it would be okay.

06:43.901 --> 06:45.528
- How you doing?
- Good.

06:45.736 --> 06:49.604
- Come on, now. Part the Red Sea.
- Have a seat.

06:49.807 --> 06:53.243
- Thank you.
- Barry, Ron, Ed, I'm Nick. You are?

06:54.278 --> 06:56.644
- Karen.
- Nice to meet you.

06:56.914 --> 06:59.405
- I'm Beverly.
- Hi, how are you?

06:59.617 --> 07:01.642
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

07:01.919 --> 07:03.216
I'm married.

07:03.821 --> 07:07.780
- You were about to attack him, huh?
- Do you work together?

07:07.992 --> 07:09.926
We're in aviation.

07:10.127 --> 07:11.924
- Pilots?
- How can you tell?

07:12.129 --> 07:13.562
I drive a plane.

07:15.299 --> 07:19.133
What are they doing?
What are they doing? Karen?

07:21.606 --> 07:23.073
You're safe.

07:23.307 --> 07:28.108
- We're air traffic controllers.
- So you work in a tower somewhere?

07:28.312 --> 07:31.577
No, we work in a big building
on the island.

07:31.782 --> 07:33.306
- A TRACON.
- A what?

07:33.517 --> 07:35.917
Terminal Radar Approach Control.

07:36.120 --> 07:40.181
- It's not near an airport.
- We funnel planes through New York.

07:40.424 --> 07:43.621
- Tower turns you over to us.
- 7000 a day.

07:43.861 --> 07:47.319
More planes closer together
than any other place.

07:47.531 --> 07:49.761
- It's true.
- It sounds tough.

07:50.001 --> 07:53.459
- It is.
- I don't know what the big deal is.

07:53.671 --> 07:58.301
Seems to me like you just sit around
talking on the radio.

07:58.643 --> 08:02.511
- It's much more complicated than that.
- It's complicated.

08:02.713 --> 08:08.049
- This job can be a bit stressful...
- Stop saying it's stressful!

09:10.781 --> 09:13.011
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, honey.

09:13.384 --> 09:16.080
- You hungry?
- No, we ate at Ted's.

09:16.287 --> 09:19.256
- Lipstick.
- Where are you going?

09:19.457 --> 09:22.722
School, to talk about
Nicky's attention span.

09:22.927 --> 09:26.693
- What about it?
- Apparently he doesn't have one.

09:28.799 --> 09:30.266
How do I look?

09:30.534 --> 09:33.367
Do I look parental and concerned?

09:34.105 --> 09:36.903
You look great. Maybe I should go too.

09:37.108 --> 09:39.975
That's okay. I can handle this.

09:41.379 --> 09:45.475
- I want you to stay, get some sleep.
- Sleep is boring.

09:45.716 --> 09:47.581
I worry about you.

09:47.785 --> 09:51.084
- Do you have to go right away?
- Why?

09:53.391 --> 09:55.621
Oh, that feels good.

09:56.560 --> 09:58.755
Will you at least hurry back?

10:01.332 --> 10:04.130
- From what?
- The attention thing.

10:04.835 --> 10:08.271
Save it, honey.
There's a casserole in the...

10:09.106 --> 10:11.904
- In the fridge.
- Fridge.

10:27.658 --> 10:30.821
- Be fast.
- It'll be like it never happened.

10:31.028 --> 10:35.692
We need one of those chairs,
the things that the old people have.

10:36.033 --> 10:38.797
Yes, I'll be right there. I'm...

10:39.003 --> 10:41.699
I'm sorry, Sister Beatrice.

10:41.939 --> 10:44.237
Yes, I understand. I'm sorry.

10:44.442 --> 10:47.536
Yes, I'm very sorry. Yeah, bye-bye.

10:48.479 --> 10:53.883
I hate conferences like this. I always
feel like a failure as a parent.

10:54.118 --> 10:57.645
She's a nun.
They're very unhappy people.

10:57.855 --> 11:02.349
- I'll help with his homework.
- Only when you work days.

11:02.560 --> 11:06.018
- He'll be a third smarter.
- You work days 12 times.

11:06.230 --> 11:10.564
- It's not a third.
- Like what? 12 into 31. It's like...

11:10.801 --> 11:15.067
- I've got my art class tonight.
- What are you talking about?

11:15.539 --> 11:20.841
The adult extension class,
Drawing the Human Form. I told you.

11:21.045 --> 11:22.410
You know, I just...

11:22.713 --> 11:25.307
...I need to feel a little more...

11:25.649 --> 11:28.641
I need to have a life of the mind.

11:30.254 --> 11:33.519
- Will there be lots of bare-assed guys?
- No.

11:33.724 --> 11:37.023
- They come later.
- That's why you're doing it.

11:37.228 --> 11:39.492
Do you think it's a bad idea?

11:39.730 --> 11:42.824
No, I think all that stuff is good.

11:44.068 --> 11:46.832
Whatever makes you happy, you know?

11:48.739 --> 11:51.367
You're happy, aren't you, Connie?

11:51.575 --> 11:54.100
Yeah. Sure.

11:56.347 --> 11:59.077
What a funny old question.

12:27.978 --> 12:32.244
This is the radar to show us
all the planes over New York.

12:32.449 --> 12:36.715
Kennedy, La Guardia and Newark
are all within 20 miles.

12:36.921 --> 12:39.116
7000 flights take off every...

12:39.390 --> 12:42.223
- What are you doing?
- Let it go.

12:42.459 --> 12:44.450
Okay, guys. Right up here.

12:44.662 --> 12:50.123
- Cute kids, Pat. They all yours?
- In the past, I laid my share of pipe.

12:50.601 --> 12:55.732
- Each of these blips is an airplane.
- Mind stepping off the rubber?

12:55.940 --> 12:58.966
Did you know that an
air traffic controller...

12:59.176 --> 13:02.509
...is responsible for more lives in a shift...

13:02.746 --> 13:05.078
...than a surgeon is in his life?

13:05.282 --> 13:08.809
- It looks like a computer game.
- This is no game.

13:09.019 --> 13:12.648
You make a mistake here,
there's no reset button.

13:12.856 --> 13:13.982
Don't touch me.

13:14.191 --> 13:18.025
I hear controllers have
the highest rates of depression...

13:18.262 --> 13:21.891
...nervous breakdowns,
heart attacks and alcoholism.

13:22.099 --> 13:26.900
- Don't forget suicide, kid.
- He always researches our field trips.

13:27.104 --> 13:29.732
- He's been online since he was 4.
- Pat.

13:29.940 --> 13:32.465
- What?
- Take them somewhere else.

13:32.710 --> 13:35.042
Okay, this way. Here we go.

13:35.245 --> 13:39.944
Controlling air traffic's
much like conducting an orchestra.

13:40.217 --> 13:44.119
Mr. Feeney used a metaphor.
Can you say "metaphor"?

13:44.321 --> 13:49.588
That wasn't a metaphor. That was
a simile. "Laying pipe" is a metaphor.

13:56.567 --> 13:59.434
I got a departure, he didn't tag up.

13:59.637 --> 14:02.128
- What did you give last?
- 28 and 8.

14:02.339 --> 14:05.399
- Climbing to 8? I don't see him.
- There!

14:05.643 --> 14:06.803
Turn him left!

14:07.011 --> 14:09.479
- I don't see his prime!
- Turn him.

14:09.680 --> 14:11.807
- Turn him!
- I'm not seeing him!

14:12.016 --> 14:14.109
- I don't see him.
- Right there.

14:14.318 --> 14:18.516
- He's got no data block.
- Is there gonna be a crash?

14:18.756 --> 14:21.987
- Get these kids out of here.
- Come on, kids.

14:24.261 --> 14:27.321
Econojet 2166, traffic at 2:00.
You see him?

14:27.531 --> 14:28.862
That's a negative.

14:29.099 --> 14:32.466
Correction. I see him!
He's headed right at me!

14:32.670 --> 14:35.867
2166, immediate left turn heading 070.
Expedite!

14:36.106 --> 14:37.630
Lmmediate. Roger.

14:41.512 --> 14:44.777
- They're in pieces.
- No, please.

14:55.793 --> 14:59.058
Econojet 2166. Left turn expedited.

14:59.296 --> 15:03.960
- I told you to turn him!
- Go, Ronnie. Go, Ronnie.

15:04.168 --> 15:06.033
- Knock it off!
- Big guy.

15:07.304 --> 15:11.570
- Nick, plug in.
- Why are you upset? Nobody got killed.

15:11.809 --> 15:15.108
- Wasn't a squawk. Not my fault.
- It's okay.

15:15.312 --> 15:18.213
- There's a Jetlink...
- I got the picture.

15:19.316 --> 15:20.908
There was no squawk.

15:21.151 --> 15:24.746
We're waiting for you in hell.
How about a wet one?

15:24.988 --> 15:26.751
- Kiss it.
- There was no ident.

15:27.024 --> 15:28.924
- Oh, no.
- It wasn't my fault.

15:29.159 --> 15:31.559
Get back to your scope.

15:34.598 --> 15:36.691
You're done. You're through.

15:36.934 --> 15:40.495
Econojet 2166,
reduce speed to 170 knots.

16:23.313 --> 16:25.804
Jerk! Can we use the street too?!

16:26.049 --> 16:28.984
It looks like I wet my pants. Fuck.

16:48.672 --> 16:51.004
That's what I'm talking about.

16:57.915 --> 17:00.406
Continental 1250, turn left 130.

17:00.617 --> 17:03.745
Continental's lined up.
Jetlink's in fourth.

17:03.954 --> 17:07.753
This looks like a parrot cage.
You're almost molting.

17:07.958 --> 17:09.117
See you.

17:09.358 --> 17:11.691
- Come on!
- Sorry.

17:12.596 --> 17:17.464
Jetlink 3596, reduce speed
to 190 knots. Fly heading 090.

17:17.667 --> 17:22.469
- Lots of dinks for a weekday.
- Let's fly up close to them big jets.

17:22.673 --> 17:28.111
- Sparta 753 for Newark approach.
- Hey, Sparta 753. Is this Jethro?

17:29.146 --> 17:32.604
- How's my favorite redneck?
- You mocking me, son?

17:32.816 --> 17:37.150
Before you run out of cornpone
or whatever you use for fuel.

17:37.354 --> 17:40.687
We wouldn't waste
good moonshine to fly.

17:40.891 --> 17:44.224
Am I supposed to
find New York by the smell?

17:44.461 --> 17:48.989
Sparta 753, turn left heading 070.
Maintain 2000 till localizer.

17:49.199 --> 17:52.464
- Cleared ILS runway four.
- ILS runway four.

17:52.669 --> 17:56.969
Let's get dinner. I wanna see
if you're as ugly as you sound.

17:57.207 --> 18:00.335
I'll find a place
where we don't need shoes.

18:00.544 --> 18:03.638
Is your pig there
or are you sleeping alone?

18:03.881 --> 18:07.317
Can I have your attention?
Turn off your scopes.

18:07.517 --> 18:10.680
This is the new man.
This is Russell Bell.

18:10.921 --> 18:14.379
Russell's worked Albuquerque,
Denver, Phoenix.

18:14.591 --> 18:16.650
He's wanted in three states.

18:16.860 --> 18:21.058
This motley group does the impossible:
Make me look good.

18:21.265 --> 18:26.202
Setting up a tailgate for the Giants game.
Meadowlands. Who's in?

18:26.403 --> 18:28.564
Who's up for it, huh? It's...

18:29.006 --> 18:30.667
You're all business.

18:30.874 --> 18:34.833
Okay, let's get
Russell checked out ASAP.

18:37.247 --> 18:41.911
Welcome aboard, Bell.
Get you started on your paperwork.

18:45.022 --> 18:48.287
- What's that?
- Who cares, if he makes the cut.

18:48.525 --> 18:52.586
That is one man closer to my getting
a quiet job upstate...

18:52.796 --> 18:55.094
...seeing a shrink with big tits.

18:55.299 --> 18:59.861
At least we know when he's here,
he won't be robbing our homes.

19:01.271 --> 19:05.264
I don't know.
I think he looks kind of interesting.

19:06.076 --> 19:09.477
You'd like to bring him down
your main runway?

19:09.713 --> 19:10.771
Go die.

19:10.981 --> 19:12.972
Like a wholegrain muffin?

19:13.250 --> 19:16.447
- That kind of interesting?
- Hanging left today?

19:16.820 --> 19:21.757
Jetlink 2946, your company traffic's
at 3:00. Slow down to 180.

19:21.959 --> 19:23.654
I am at 180.

19:23.927 --> 19:25.895
Correction, 160.

19:30.667 --> 19:33.966
I heard of this guy.
I got a buddy in Denver...

19:34.171 --> 19:38.107
...who mentioned a weird guy
who was the best controller.

19:38.308 --> 19:42.074
In the sticks.
Till you hit five, living is easy.

19:42.279 --> 19:45.077
If it's him, I also heard he's crazy.

19:45.315 --> 19:49.149
He stood on a runway
and let a 747 fly over his head.

19:49.353 --> 19:50.342
What for?

19:50.587 --> 19:53.852
To understand what
wake turbulence felt like.

19:55.092 --> 19:57.151
- That's bullshit.
- That's bogus.

19:57.361 --> 20:01.263
We allow five miles between planes
for wake turbulence.

20:01.465 --> 20:02.898
That's what I heard.

20:03.100 --> 20:07.264
- It would've killed him.
- You've seen him. Sure it didn't?

20:08.972 --> 20:10.530
Hey, Russell.

20:12.275 --> 20:15.767
You've met Ron Hewitt,
our very own Emily Post.

20:15.979 --> 20:17.810
Let's go, smiley.

20:22.886 --> 20:27.220
Nick Falzone. I'm called "The Zone."
Shake it like you mean it.

20:31.228 --> 20:35.187
So we're going out
after work for a few drinks...

20:35.399 --> 20:37.993
...a few laughs. You wanna join us?

20:45.942 --> 20:47.466
You don't say much.

21:00.457 --> 21:03.949
- Trudy, hit us up.
- Bring us seven shots, will you?

21:04.161 --> 21:07.597
Russell, word is you're a good controller.

21:07.798 --> 21:10.733
What's the most planes
you had to handle?

21:10.934 --> 21:16.304
- I didn't have time to count. Why?
- Our washout rate's a mere 50% .

21:16.506 --> 21:20.306
We wonder if the new guy
will go wacko when cornered.

21:20.510 --> 21:22.910
And you will get cornered here.

21:23.747 --> 21:25.908
Don't unpack.

21:26.149 --> 21:29.641
I just move them around
so they don't collide.

21:29.853 --> 21:32.845
I felt that way, but they're human beings.

21:33.090 --> 21:36.025
- Kind of dampens it.
- Nobody told me that.

21:36.259 --> 21:39.160
One more round, then I'm cutting you off.

21:39.362 --> 21:42.854
They test you,
you're blowing it without my help.

21:43.100 --> 21:46.331
We heard you stood on a runway
in New Mexico...

21:46.536 --> 21:50.131
...and let a 747 part your hair
with wake turbulence.

21:50.340 --> 21:52.331
- That happen?
- No.

21:52.709 --> 21:56.338
- That's what we thought.
- No, that was in Arizona.

21:58.048 --> 22:00.107
You really did that?

22:03.653 --> 22:08.056
- Why?
- My life was short on excitement.

22:08.391 --> 22:11.554
Of course, all that's changed tonight.

22:12.362 --> 22:15.229
- I'll get the tip.
- No, we'll flip for it.

22:15.432 --> 22:19.368
- Nope. On the quick, you ready?
- Can't we flip?

22:19.903 --> 22:23.999
- Everybody take a match.
- I hate this! Why do we do this?

22:24.207 --> 22:28.166
- Reindeer games.
- Got it? Strike on the count of three.

22:28.378 --> 22:30.846
- Wait, wait, wait.
- I'll count.

22:31.047 --> 22:33.743
One, two, three.

22:34.384 --> 22:39.378
- First one to drop it pays the tip.
- Wait, mine's burning faster.

22:39.656 --> 22:42.784
- Mine's burning faster.
- Another conspiracy.

22:42.993 --> 22:45.461
It's burning faster than yours.

22:45.695 --> 22:48.926
- Shit!
- We'll see if Ron owns a wallet.

22:49.166 --> 22:53.034
I own a wallet. It's not fair.
It's cheap matches.

22:53.270 --> 22:55.135
Guys, Ron's paying.

22:57.440 --> 23:00.500
Game's over, guys. Come on.

23:00.710 --> 23:03.201
You guys, what are you doing?

23:18.695 --> 23:20.162
I guess that's it.

23:25.035 --> 23:27.833
I guess I'd better get out of here.

23:33.476 --> 23:37.003
- Jesus, what was that all about?
- Nothing.

23:40.250 --> 23:43.481
Hey, Tommy, Dr. Freeze is back.

23:44.421 --> 23:46.013
Tina, guess what?

23:46.223 --> 23:49.317
- Dr. Freeze has returned.
- I'm coming.

23:51.895 --> 23:56.355
- Ed, Dr. Freeze is back.
- He's working with a new therapist.

23:56.566 --> 23:59.558
Five dollars says
he gets to the scopes.

24:00.070 --> 24:03.062
Dr. Freeze is back
to try it one more time.

24:03.273 --> 24:06.174
- Who's Freeze, Tommy?
- Who's Freeze?

24:06.376 --> 24:11.678
He froze up on the scopes so bad,
they took him out in an ice-cream bag.

24:15.252 --> 24:17.584
It's a big sky. Lots of room.

24:17.787 --> 24:21.223
They won't hit. Lots of room.

24:22.859 --> 24:26.693
It's a big sky. Lots of room.

24:26.896 --> 24:29.956
They won't hit. Lots of room.

24:31.301 --> 24:34.566
- There he is!
- Morning, doc!

24:35.238 --> 24:36.899
Good to see you.

24:43.313 --> 24:46.441
All right, doc. Come on down.

24:47.884 --> 24:50.876
Lots of planes waiting out there, doc.

24:51.488 --> 24:55.015
- Come on, doc.
- You can do it. Come on, baby!

24:55.225 --> 24:56.556
Lots of sky.

24:56.826 --> 24:59.294
- Lots of sky.
- Looking good, doc.

24:59.829 --> 25:01.922
- United 2417...
- On approach.

25:02.232 --> 25:04.427
...climb to 4000.

25:06.403 --> 25:08.394
You got it. It's yours.

25:12.676 --> 25:14.837
One, two...

25:15.745 --> 25:17.576
I don't know, sir.

25:18.114 --> 25:20.639
- Lots of sky!
- Goodbye!

25:22.752 --> 25:24.617
Give me the money!

25:24.854 --> 25:28.449
- I had the door.
- You had the doorway.

25:28.658 --> 25:30.387
What's the difference?

25:30.593 --> 25:33.960
- Two inches from the door.
- From there to there...

25:37.200 --> 25:39.725
Not to worry. How's it going?

25:39.936 --> 25:42.268
- I got to the door.
- Way to go!

25:42.505 --> 25:47.374
- That's your best since you went down.
- I got hypnosis to thank.

25:47.977 --> 25:51.344
- Good to see you. Come back soon.
- You too.

26:37.227 --> 26:39.161
You're an hour late.

26:39.362 --> 26:42.889
USAir 2166, turn left heading 120.
Altimeter 2992.

26:43.099 --> 26:46.933
- I'm up to my ass in airplanes...
- Roger. USAir 2166.

26:47.170 --> 26:49.001
Looks frightening, huh?

26:51.875 --> 26:55.936
Continental 2591, contact tower 118.3.
Take care, thanks.

26:59.416 --> 27:02.613
- Brought your chair with you.
- Yeah.

27:02.852 --> 27:07.221
- Is that a good-luck charm?
- I thought you were busy.

27:07.857 --> 27:10.883
Continental 2735,
caution wake turbulence.

27:11.127 --> 27:13.459
Contact tower 118.3. Thanks.

27:14.197 --> 27:16.597
Got you, 2735. Good day.

27:17.867 --> 27:21.735
Okay, chief, slide on in.
Let's get you all saddled up.

27:28.311 --> 27:33.112
- Delta's due for a right turn. Jet...
- I get it. I got the picture.

27:33.316 --> 27:36.808
Delta 532, turn left heading 140,
maintain 4000.

27:37.053 --> 27:40.147
- Was that 140?
- You'll be right up his butt.

27:40.423 --> 27:42.323
Delta 532. Up his butt.

27:42.559 --> 27:46.222
- Jetlink 3601, fly south heading 180.
- Jetlink. 180.

27:46.429 --> 27:51.264
- Eagle 4912, descend to 4000.
- Five to four. 4912.

27:51.734 --> 27:55.226
You got two airplanes
headed towards each other.

27:55.772 --> 27:57.433
- Yes.
- You gonna turn one?

27:57.640 --> 28:02.168
- After I put the Jetlink between them.
- You wanna be in the paper?

28:02.445 --> 28:06.905
If I don't, everyone loses the connections.
Delta 532, slow to 160.

28:07.150 --> 28:10.017
Continental 2478, slow to 140.

28:10.353 --> 28:14.346
- Jetlink 3594, increase speed to 230.
- Did you say 230?

28:14.591 --> 28:18.584
That's right. I need it now.
Come on. Pedal faster.

28:19.629 --> 28:24.657
- 2478, traffic at your 10:00.
- We've got him in sight. 2478.

28:24.868 --> 28:27.803
532, verify visual contact with 2:00.

28:28.004 --> 28:31.167
That's affirmative.
He's hard to miss now.

28:39.983 --> 28:44.613
- What's the problem?
- He almost put three planes together.

28:44.821 --> 28:46.448
They had visual.

28:46.723 --> 28:49.715
These two planes
are going nose to nose!

28:50.793 --> 28:56.060
Continental 2478, turn right
heading 060, slow to 140.

28:57.200 --> 29:00.328
- Delta 532, slow to 160.
- 160.

29:00.637 --> 29:04.038
- Continental 2478, descend to 3000.
- 2478.

29:04.240 --> 29:08.370
Delta 532, make a hard left turn
heading 090.

29:11.314 --> 29:13.179
It's too steep a turn.

29:14.684 --> 29:19.053
- I'm gonna kiss my tail.
- Make the turn or I'll spin you.

29:19.255 --> 29:22.986
You'll land nice and easy
sometime before Christmas.

29:25.261 --> 29:28.230
Left heading 090. Delta.

29:38.675 --> 29:42.042
Delta 532. Scary,
but I must say, good job.

29:42.245 --> 29:45.271
- Thank you very much.
- Good job.

29:45.548 --> 29:47.573
Nice talking to you, Bill.

29:48.117 --> 29:50.108
Yeah, you too, Nick.

29:53.356 --> 29:55.790
Nick, come on in.
Come on, boy.

29:56.059 --> 29:59.893
Come on in. Jeez.
Take a seat, pal. Go ahead.

30:00.096 --> 30:05.090
I called the traffic manager
about Russell. He sent me this.

30:48.277 --> 30:52.179
- Watch it again! This is funny stuff.
- Play that again.

31:05.361 --> 31:07.295
Do you believe that?

31:11.834 --> 31:14.803
He's a fucking cowboy. You know that?

31:15.004 --> 31:20.101
It's funny you should say that.
They told me he's part Cree Indian.

31:20.309 --> 31:22.903
He's a half-breed. He doesn't fit.

31:23.112 --> 31:26.513
There's an aluminum shower
in his future.

31:26.716 --> 31:30.015
Passenger safety
is our highest priority.

31:30.219 --> 31:34.019
Keeping them alive is second
to keeping them on time.

31:34.223 --> 31:37.317
I know he brings
them in steep and tight.

31:37.527 --> 31:41.122
But those airlines won't be
on my ass about delays...

31:41.364 --> 31:44.162
...while he's on the scopes.
He pushes tin.

31:47.203 --> 31:50.195
So, you gonna sign off on him or what?

31:50.973 --> 31:54.841
- Everyone likes him, I like him too.
- Everyone loves him.

31:55.044 --> 31:56.909
- What's not to like?
- Exactly.

31:57.146 --> 32:00.673
Ask all your buddies down there,
all those guys.

32:01.084 --> 32:06.078
Let me tell you something, Pat Sajak.
I say the guy's a loose cannon.

32:06.989 --> 32:09.389
Takes one to know one, Nicky.

32:12.395 --> 32:15.330
Take a dog.
I'm gonna run out of burgers.

32:17.700 --> 32:18.928
Damn it!

32:19.168 --> 32:22.160
I left a note to use
alternate climb-outs.

32:22.371 --> 32:25.340
- Who's on departure?
- Probably Harrison.

32:25.541 --> 32:27.736
Harrison, you asshole!

32:28.177 --> 32:31.112
Every 747 tomorrow will blow his roof!

32:31.380 --> 32:35.043
Well, at least it drowns out Falzone.

32:35.251 --> 32:39.620
- You believe he's never had a lesson?
- More beef, Todd?

32:51.100 --> 32:54.729
My grandmother made sweaters.
You remind me of her.

32:54.937 --> 32:57.929
- Thank you.
- No, I don't mean it badly.

32:58.141 --> 33:01.736
I want you to make me one.
Would you make me one?

33:01.978 --> 33:03.639
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

33:03.880 --> 33:05.575
- A red one?
- Lf you want.

33:05.782 --> 33:08.649
Barry gnashes his teeth while he sleeps.

33:08.885 --> 33:11.718
Ed did that until he got this jaw clamp.

33:11.954 --> 33:13.785
- Does it work?
- Very well.

33:13.990 --> 33:16.151
He's gone through three.

33:16.392 --> 33:19.054
- Is it expensive?
- It's worth it.

33:19.295 --> 33:22.628
Turn angry postal workers
into a fighting force.

33:22.832 --> 33:25.392
Discipline would be a tall order...

33:25.601 --> 33:29.264
...but it would be perfect
for kamikaze missions.

33:29.672 --> 33:31.139
Barry?

33:32.175 --> 33:36.111
Hi. Welcome. I'm Ed Clabes.
This is my party. You're...?

33:36.312 --> 33:39.247
- She'd make you pay for it.
- Shut up.

33:40.082 --> 33:43.779
- Real nice job.
- How are you doing? I'm Crystal.

33:43.986 --> 33:48.685
Zone, give me a beer.
Put them back in their holsters, boys.

33:48.925 --> 33:52.656
- That's Russell's wife.
- Russell's got a wife?

33:53.763 --> 33:59.099
- You invited Russell?
- Julie said he sounded interesting.

33:59.368 --> 34:00.596
Problem, Nick?

34:00.803 --> 34:04.398
We get liquored up alone.
It's a tightknit group.

34:04.607 --> 34:06.768
It might upset our balance.

34:06.976 --> 34:11.003
- What's she doing with him?
- He's got her parents tied up.

34:11.781 --> 34:13.476
Hello.

34:14.951 --> 34:18.784
- How are you?
- We were just talking about you.

34:18.987 --> 34:21.786
- Zoner, get the man a beer.
- Coming up.

34:22.058 --> 34:25.152
- I don't drink.
- He doesn't drink.

34:25.393 --> 34:28.158
I met your wife. Very nice lady.

34:28.364 --> 34:30.355
Why don't I show you around?

34:32.902 --> 34:35.871
Let's go. Thanks so much for coming by.

34:36.072 --> 34:38.302
Glad you worked that one out.

34:41.844 --> 34:43.869
She's coming this way.

34:44.146 --> 34:47.047
- Act like you could give a shit.
- Relax.

34:47.416 --> 34:49.043
- Nick Falzone.
- Hi.

34:49.252 --> 34:52.085
- Maybe your husband mentioned me.
- Right.

34:52.321 --> 34:53.913
This is Barry and Ron.

34:54.156 --> 34:57.091
- Could I have a vodka tonic, please?
- Sure.

34:57.326 --> 35:02.389
Move out of the way. It's the
perfect accompaniment for burnt steak.

35:02.598 --> 35:05.396
- Honey, I need a refill.
- Hey, muffin.

35:06.335 --> 35:10.738
Hello. I'm Connie Falzone.
I just met your husband.

35:11.073 --> 35:14.201
- I'm Crystal. Nice to meet you.
- Oh, hi.

35:14.543 --> 35:17.068
Have you met my husband, Nick?

35:17.280 --> 35:20.272
- No.
- Let's try that again. I'm Nick.

35:20.516 --> 35:24.577
- Here he is.
- I'm here all week. Nice to meet you.

35:24.921 --> 35:29.017
- So, Mary, do you have children?
- No, I don't.

35:29.225 --> 35:30.692
You don't?

35:31.761 --> 35:35.288
- No, please, come and sit down.
- Jeez, Louise!

35:35.531 --> 35:38.762
- She does a nice job for us.
- A fine job.

35:38.968 --> 35:40.299
My God.

35:51.147 --> 35:55.049
All right, game, game.
Free-throw contest.

35:55.251 --> 35:58.277
- I'll start.
- Okay.

35:58.554 --> 36:02.046
Get a room.
We're having a free-throw contest.

36:04.593 --> 36:06.458
Oh, come on.

36:06.662 --> 36:07.890
One!

36:08.164 --> 36:09.961
- Very nice.
- One!

36:14.637 --> 36:19.040
You know how it is. You ask
where he wants to go for dinner...

36:19.241 --> 36:20.902
...and he goes ballistic.

36:21.110 --> 36:25.444
"I make 800 decisions a day.
You could make one tonight."

36:25.648 --> 36:29.778
- God forbid you make the wrong one.
- Because they never are.

36:29.986 --> 36:34.446
- They can't afford to be.
- Always sticking up for her husband.

36:34.657 --> 36:37.524
Don't forget. Connie's a first.

36:37.927 --> 36:40.191
Mary, what number are you?

36:40.696 --> 36:43.961
- I'm sorry. Number what?
- Which Mrs. Bell?

36:44.166 --> 36:49.035
Tanya and Crystal are seconds.
I'm a third. Linda's a fourth, right?

36:49.271 --> 36:52.172
At O'Hare, my best friend was a fifth.

36:52.375 --> 36:55.435
Or that's what she put away
every night.

36:58.848 --> 37:01.544
- It's not that funny.
- Come sit down.

37:03.019 --> 37:06.955
Seventeen! New record for The Zone!

37:15.197 --> 37:17.392
Too bad. Too bad.

37:17.666 --> 37:22.729
Ladies and gentlemen, world record!
Seventeen, Nick Falzone.

37:24.473 --> 37:28.500
It's a natural gift.
Anyone wanna go through the motions?

37:29.678 --> 37:32.670
- I'll go.
- Russell Bell.

37:33.382 --> 37:37.819
What's important is that Ed came home
with $100,000 last year...

37:38.020 --> 37:40.284
...and he barely finished school.

37:40.489 --> 37:45.222
Even after we save money for the
kids' college and Ed's breakdown...

37:45.428 --> 37:48.829
...it's still a good chunk of change.
- Well done.

37:49.265 --> 37:50.755
Excuse me.

37:53.936 --> 37:56.996
Oh, by the way, I'm a first.

37:58.274 --> 38:01.038
Well, she's not gonna be the last.

38:01.243 --> 38:05.407
- Think they're real?
- Lf they are, we'll have to kill her.

38:06.615 --> 38:08.242
Nine!

38:19.962 --> 38:22.055
You trying to take my job?

38:22.264 --> 38:25.961
- Sorry, Barry. You the bartender here?
- Nick!

38:26.202 --> 38:29.296
- Nick. Nick, third time.
- Nick!

38:29.538 --> 38:32.405
I'll make you a tropical drink.

38:32.608 --> 38:37.671
- You'll feel no problems.
- What makes you think I have problems?

38:37.880 --> 38:40.781
Everybody's got problems, don't they?

38:40.983 --> 38:45.420
- Is this the biggest glass?
- I could find a bucket for you.

38:46.822 --> 38:48.653
Fourteen!

38:53.162 --> 38:54.720
Fifteen!

38:56.665 --> 38:59.793
- Nice talking to you.
- Sixteen!

39:00.636 --> 39:01.967
Seventeen!

39:07.943 --> 39:11.640
That is 18! That is a new record!

39:26.629 --> 39:27.789
I wanna go home.

39:32.034 --> 39:35.663
- We're leaving.
- You'll get your winnings tomorrow.

39:35.871 --> 39:37.168
Bell!

39:37.840 --> 39:41.241
- $100 says you can't hit it from there.
- Come on!

39:41.443 --> 39:43.877
- All right, 50¢.
- You said $100.

39:44.380 --> 39:47.281
- I did say $100.
- You don't have to.

39:47.483 --> 39:49.508
- He's a gambling man.
- Come on.

39:49.718 --> 39:52.278
You could do a three-point shot.

40:00.563 --> 40:02.360
You were very close.

40:02.565 --> 40:05.329
Close enough. We'll call it even.

40:19.081 --> 40:21.572
You either make it or you don't.

40:23.219 --> 40:25.585
- See you.
- Thanks a lot.

40:25.854 --> 40:27.719
Yeah, see you Monday.

40:28.557 --> 40:32.550
Okay. I'm gonna shoot.
I'm gonna shoot.

40:32.761 --> 40:34.160
Ready?

40:41.070 --> 40:44.096
- Did you have a good time?
- Yeah. Did you?

40:44.673 --> 40:46.698
- Yeah.
- Good.

40:49.578 --> 40:51.944
What'd you think of the Bells?

40:52.581 --> 40:57.541
- I don't know. They're all right.
- She's a little standoffish, but...

40:57.753 --> 41:01.553
You know, I think she's
a bit of a sauce monster.

41:01.757 --> 41:04.521
- I think she's insecure.
- Maybe.

41:04.727 --> 41:07.389
Though she's very, very pretty.

41:07.596 --> 41:11.589
- You're prettier.
- Oh, gee. I don't think so.

41:11.867 --> 41:16.736
No, you are. Anybody says different,
I'll chop them into ground beef.

41:16.939 --> 41:18.372
Will you?

41:19.141 --> 41:22.372
- You're my guy.
- I know how to talk, right?

41:22.578 --> 41:24.876
Yeah. Not bad.

41:29.952 --> 41:33.479
What do you think of him?
He's weird, isn't he?

41:33.722 --> 41:35.280
Yeah.

41:36.425 --> 41:38.222
He's...

41:38.827 --> 41:40.920
He's sort of...

41:41.430 --> 41:43.261
...interesting.

41:43.966 --> 41:48.062
Eagle 4912, do not exceed 150 knots.
I'll give you a spin.

41:48.270 --> 41:51.239
Jetlink 3889, can you increase to 190?

41:51.440 --> 41:52.771
No problem. 3889.

41:52.975 --> 41:55.739
Northwest 3518, descend.
Maintain 2000.

41:55.944 --> 42:00.643
- I have a hole. I need a plane.
- We can't get them all down at once.

42:00.849 --> 42:04.148
- Where's the hole?
- Here. Can you get me one?

42:04.353 --> 42:06.253
- You got it.
- Go ahead.

42:06.455 --> 42:10.414
- 744, cleared ILS runway 4.
- You're clear for approach.

42:10.659 --> 42:14.755
- 1783, descend. Maintain 5000.
- I got two more heavies.

42:14.963 --> 42:16.362
- I'll take them.
- Here.

42:16.632 --> 42:20.295
- 1698, traffic, 12:00. Do you see him?
- Will look.

42:20.536 --> 42:24.529
Keep searching. Inbound speed 160.
Now, 1698.

42:24.773 --> 42:26.673
- Easy.
- I want an airplane!

42:26.875 --> 42:28.502
- Where?
- By the United!

42:28.711 --> 42:31.771
- You'll have to slow that 747.
- I won't slow...

42:32.014 --> 42:33.345
747's with Russell.

42:33.549 --> 42:36.609
United 3426, you have traffic at 3:00.

42:36.819 --> 42:38.878
Continental, heading 141.

42:39.121 --> 42:42.318
Maintain 3000. Turn left 120.
What's Bob got?

42:42.558 --> 42:46.016
- This guy's got...
- What's he doing with that Delta?

42:46.228 --> 42:49.959
- I want the Delta.
- Kennedy rerouted a JAL heavy.

42:50.165 --> 42:52.690
- I got it!
- You don't have space.

42:52.901 --> 42:56.701
- I got a hole. I gotta take it now.
- Where's the hole?

42:56.905 --> 43:01.638
Behind the Delta. He'll bounce around
but I'll get him down.

43:02.745 --> 43:04.212
He's got no hole.

43:04.413 --> 43:06.847
- It's a hole.
- Gentlemen, please.

43:07.049 --> 43:10.917
Bring the Japan in.
I'm telling center to slow them.

43:11.153 --> 43:13.314
- This is nuts.
- It wasn't a hole.

43:13.522 --> 43:15.046
- It was.
- Was not.

43:15.257 --> 43:18.192
- Yes, it was.
- It wasn't a hole.

43:18.927 --> 43:20.519
It was. He's in it.

43:20.729 --> 43:22.196
- Ladies!
- It's a hole.

43:22.398 --> 43:24.559
Can we direct some traffic?

43:28.103 --> 43:30.367
- You wanna come with me?
- Where?

43:30.606 --> 43:32.267
Doughnut fix.

43:34.610 --> 43:37.511
Yeah. Let's do it.

44:55.157 --> 44:57.591
Don't get any greener.

45:06.835 --> 45:08.462
Get out of the road!

45:08.770 --> 45:10.499
Out!

45:14.543 --> 45:15.942
Oh, good. It's open.

45:19.047 --> 45:22.608
- I want a croissant.
- Croissants are bread.

45:22.818 --> 45:26.345
- Croissants are pastry.
- No. Pastry's sweet.

45:26.555 --> 45:28.455
Not all of it.

45:28.891 --> 45:31.382
They don't have croissants.

46:02.558 --> 46:04.321
Mrs. Bell?

46:05.928 --> 46:08.089
God, please take me now.

46:10.098 --> 46:13.067
- Is there anything I can do?
- No, I'm fine.

46:14.069 --> 46:17.368
Is this man bothering you?
What did you say?

46:17.573 --> 46:21.669
Go away. Move it.
Go battle evil on aisle 12.

46:25.614 --> 46:28.515
- You have no idea how I hate this.
- What?

46:28.750 --> 46:33.551
- Men feel superior when women cry.
- I don't. I cry all the time.

46:33.755 --> 46:35.689
- You do?
- I'm famous for it.

46:35.891 --> 46:38.860
I've never cried at the supermarket.

46:39.061 --> 46:44.124
I cry at old movies, songs, weddings.
I cried like a baby at my own.

46:45.300 --> 46:47.268
Where's Russell tonight?

46:48.470 --> 46:50.961
- Gone.
- He's gone where?

46:51.206 --> 46:53.003
I don't know.

46:53.208 --> 46:57.702
He takes off on his motorcycle
and says he'll see me tomorrow.

46:59.114 --> 47:01.048
I understand.

47:01.550 --> 47:04.383
No, you don't understand.
That's not it.

47:04.586 --> 47:09.387
- Men aren't the only reason women cry.
- He's nuts for leaving you.

47:09.625 --> 47:14.392
That's just Russell. It's just
something he does. All right?

47:14.596 --> 47:18.293
This is what I have come to do.
Discuss my marriage...

47:18.500 --> 47:23.335
...in a supermarket with a fucking
stranger. Goodbye, Mr. Falzone.

47:31.913 --> 47:33.608
Mrs. Bell?

47:33.982 --> 47:35.711
God! What?

47:35.917 --> 47:40.911
Listen. I know this great,
I'm talking great, Italian restaurant.

47:41.990 --> 47:47.155
It's a family-owned, local joint.
Best things aren't even on the menu.

47:48.430 --> 47:52.662
- You're asking me out?
- No. My wife has an art class.

47:52.868 --> 47:57.430
I hate eating alone in restaurants.
It's a humanitarian gesture.

47:57.673 --> 48:00.870
You should eat
before you hit that vodka.

48:04.012 --> 48:09.040
- Whatever I order will be on me.
- It's all right. We'll get you a bib.

48:11.887 --> 48:16.415
Tell me something. Are there people
who find you charming?

48:16.625 --> 48:19.856
Well, they pretend
because I try so hard.

48:59.901 --> 49:01.698
He's fantastic, yes?

49:02.337 --> 49:03.668
Here you go.

49:05.907 --> 49:10.105
Come on. See, that's a nice smile.

49:10.378 --> 49:12.346
First time you used it?

49:12.547 --> 49:15.573
I'm really not as big a bitch as you think.

49:15.784 --> 49:18.912
I've formed absolutely no opinion of you.

49:28.063 --> 49:30.361
So who are you? What do you...?

49:30.565 --> 49:33.591
What do you like to do? Do you work?

49:34.636 --> 49:37.537
Yeah, I do. I'm a social worker.

49:40.442 --> 49:41.932
Is that right?

49:43.311 --> 49:48.146
I took some classes, but I can't
even get volunteer work here.

49:48.750 --> 49:53.483
- Nobody in New York needs any help.
- No, we're all doing fine.

49:55.457 --> 49:59.791
Cheers. It's better than
the frozen food section.

50:04.833 --> 50:10.135
I never get drunk. I drink a lot.
I got the constitution of a walrus.

50:10.338 --> 50:14.172
Do that thing.
Put your hand up there. Yeah, see?

50:14.409 --> 50:18.846
That's definitely your evil side.
It's an angel.

50:19.114 --> 50:21.742
- You like the evil one.
- That one's bad.

50:21.950 --> 50:24.976
It's got a nice
Dorothy Hamill vibe going.

50:25.921 --> 50:30.017
So besides getting tattoos,
what are your hobbies?

50:30.592 --> 50:33.584
- Everybody's good at something.
- I read.

50:33.929 --> 50:36.796
You like to read?
Fiction, romance stuff?

50:37.032 --> 50:39.500
- Sure.
- Well, that's fun.

50:40.669 --> 50:44.332
Tons of fun. And I grow things.

50:44.539 --> 50:46.166
- Pardon?
- I grow things.

50:48.844 --> 50:51.312
- Flowers?
- And plants, usually.

50:51.546 --> 50:53.980
Some flowers, yeah. Just...

50:54.850 --> 50:56.875
That's nice.

50:57.953 --> 50:59.614
Wanna know something?

51:01.857 --> 51:07.318
I was crying in the supermarket
because I lost a plant today.

51:09.164 --> 51:12.725
My fuchsia hybrida voodoo died
this morning.

51:15.303 --> 51:18.966
I carried that plant on my lap
all over the country.

51:19.975 --> 51:21.704
It was like a pet.

51:21.910 --> 51:25.903
I'd take it into every bedroom
and put it by the bed...

51:26.147 --> 51:29.844
...and it'd make everything
feel cozy and familiar.

51:37.259 --> 51:39.659
Now, what, you think I'm crazy?

51:40.896 --> 51:46.095
I think you're a very intelligent woman,
who is in a new city...

51:47.235 --> 51:50.693
...who is lonely and a little scared.

51:54.743 --> 51:56.335
I love my husband.

51:57.412 --> 51:58.606
I love my wife.

51:58.847 --> 52:01.941
Here you go. My best Barbaresco.

52:05.086 --> 52:10.353
- Goddamn it, I'm in love with you.
- I'm in love with you too.

52:10.558 --> 52:14.460
Enzo, when you love somebody,
it's no good.

52:16.564 --> 52:18.623
He's gonna go sing now.

52:30.278 --> 52:31.802
Everybody!

52:48.463 --> 52:52.456
- Thanks for eating with me.
- Thank you.

52:52.834 --> 52:55.234
- Hope you had a good time.
- I did.

52:55.437 --> 52:58.463
- Good.
- I did.

53:00.075 --> 53:03.806
Be all right getting home?
You've had a lot of wine.

53:04.012 --> 53:07.470
- Want me to follow you?
- No, I'll be fine.

53:07.682 --> 53:11.516
No Russell at home,
no fuchsia hybrida voodoo.

53:11.753 --> 53:13.744
Hey, you remembered.

53:13.955 --> 53:17.254
It's my job, listening
and remembering things.

53:18.526 --> 53:20.619
- Yeah, I'll be fine.
- Okay.

53:21.296 --> 53:25.824
- Then I guess this is good night.
- Good night. See you around.

54:02.804 --> 54:07.070
I've had quite a bit of wine.
You should follow me home.

54:24.759 --> 54:26.488
Well, good night.

55:02.263 --> 55:04.629
I'm so sorry.

55:05.200 --> 55:06.531
What?

55:08.369 --> 55:10.701
I wasn't talking to you.

55:12.140 --> 55:14.233
Who were you talking to?

55:16.778 --> 55:18.643
God, I guess.

55:21.149 --> 55:24.949
Do we go directly
from afterglow to shame?

55:26.988 --> 55:31.322
Russell's not gonna come in here
and burst in on us, is he?

55:32.327 --> 55:34.887
No, he's usually gone all night.

55:36.798 --> 55:39.494
How do you know? Where does he go?

55:41.402 --> 55:45.736
- I don't know.
- I mean, don't you ever ask him?

55:48.143 --> 55:52.079
You're really interested in Russell,
you know that?

55:52.280 --> 55:54.111
No, no. What do you mean?

55:58.920 --> 56:01.980
Can I ask you something personal?

56:04.325 --> 56:08.022
Whatever we do,
let's not get personal tonight.

56:08.463 --> 56:10.954
Have you ever done this before?

56:14.369 --> 56:17.497
That is a truly horrible question.

56:23.822 --> 56:27.053
It's the first time
I've ever cheated on him.

56:27.893 --> 56:32.262
I don't know why I did it.
I didn't want to be alone and he's...

56:36.268 --> 56:38.532
He keeps to himself a lot.

56:46.612 --> 56:48.739
What time is it, anyway?

56:52.951 --> 56:54.782
Hey, I better...

56:55.354 --> 56:59.518
I better get going.
It's getting kind of late, you know?

56:59.725 --> 57:04.128
I got my wife coming back
from art class and I don't know if...

57:08.767 --> 57:11.258
- Bye.
- Right.

57:13.805 --> 57:15.238
So...

57:15.741 --> 57:18.437
...Mary, if we don't talk
or anything...

57:18.644 --> 57:23.104
...don't take that as a reflection
on you or anything.

57:23.315 --> 57:28.218
You strike me as someone
who might take things...

57:31.790 --> 57:35.886
Who might take that stuff personally.
Don't think...

57:36.128 --> 57:38.562
- Mr. Falzone?
- Nick! Call me Nick.

57:38.764 --> 57:42.962
What are the fewest number of words
you can use to leave?

57:43.168 --> 57:45.728
I see. Very few.

57:48.073 --> 57:52.237
I want you to know I never planned
on sleeping with you.

57:52.444 --> 57:57.848
It was strange, and I enjoyed it
and I'll see you around.

58:00.419 --> 58:01.977
- Hey, baby.
- Hey.

58:02.254 --> 58:05.553
Wait. Come here.
I wanna show you something.

58:05.757 --> 58:08.123
Ready? Come here.

58:09.861 --> 58:12.329
- Did it in class tonight.
- J.F. K.?

58:13.198 --> 58:15.928
- You could tell?
- Looks just like him.

58:17.469 --> 58:20.165
You know, I feel like I know him.

58:20.372 --> 58:25.139
Yeah, we all do. That's an
original Falzone. We gotta hang it up.

58:25.343 --> 58:28.335
I'm gonna hit the shower. Guess what?

58:28.547 --> 58:32.039
- I had a hot date tonight.
- You did?

58:32.284 --> 58:34.149
- With who?
- Listen to this.

58:34.352 --> 58:37.651
I run into Mary Bell
at the supermarket.

58:37.856 --> 58:41.292
She's crying.
She had a nervous breakdown.

58:41.493 --> 58:44.894
Her plant had died.
Some craziness, right?

58:45.130 --> 58:48.691
- So I took her to Enzo's.
- Enzo's?

58:48.900 --> 58:50.800
That was nice of you.

58:51.002 --> 58:55.666
Russell split town on her and
she was having a nervous breakdown.

58:55.874 --> 58:59.742
Sweet kid, so I just
sobered her up a bit, you know?

59:00.212 --> 59:02.305
It was real nice of you.

59:02.514 --> 59:05.972
- Well, I didn't know...
- I should call her.

59:12.023 --> 59:15.151
Have you seen Russell
around anywhere?

59:15.827 --> 59:19.524
- He was here a minute ago.
- Yeah? How did he seem?

59:19.731 --> 59:23.030
- What do you mean?
- How did he seem?

59:24.035 --> 59:28.938
I'll give him a complete physical
the next time I run into him.

59:31.576 --> 59:33.339
- Hello.
- Hey, honey.

59:33.545 --> 59:35.342
Great. Nicky, what's up?

59:35.547 --> 59:40.075
You wanna have dinner tonight with me?
Relax a little together?

59:40.352 --> 59:43.913
Sure. Okay. At Enzo's?

59:44.122 --> 59:46.249
- No, someplace else.
- Where?

59:46.458 --> 59:49.825
- You pick.
- What's wrong with Enzo's?

59:50.028 --> 59:54.795
- Bad experience with Mary Bell?
- It would've been better with you.

59:55.066 --> 59:57.694
- I mean, Enzo's would've been.
- Right.

59:57.936 --> 01:00:01.201
They treat us better
when we're both there.

01:00:01.406 --> 01:00:04.967
- I hadn't noticed that.
- Right. Enzo's it is.

01:00:07.879 --> 01:00:10.439
- I love you.
- I love you too.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:26.056
- What's that racket?
- Enzo's getting good, huh?

01:00:30.468 --> 01:00:32.959
- Mr. And Mrs. Falzone.
- How are you?

01:00:33.238 --> 01:00:36.503
- I'm fine, thanks.
- Jesus Christ.

01:00:37.676 --> 01:00:42.113
Mr. And Mrs. Falzone, welcome.
It's so good to see you.

01:00:43.315 --> 01:00:46.045
- Your table is this way.
- Wanna leave?

01:00:46.251 --> 01:00:49.345
- It's Russell.
- Yeah, I know. I saw him.

01:01:04.469 --> 01:01:06.096
Don't worry.

01:01:06.805 --> 01:01:11.333
- Is there a table by the window?
- Sorry. We're full tonight.

01:01:25.991 --> 01:01:28.357
- They should join us.
- Who?

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.050
- The Bells.
- No.

01:01:30.295 --> 01:01:33.355
- Why not?
- This is a romantic dinner.

01:01:33.565 --> 01:01:37.899
- We're in that mode.
- Your husband has a beautiful voice.

01:01:38.136 --> 01:01:39.626
- Hi, Mary.
- Hi.

01:01:40.171 --> 01:01:42.662
- Nice to see you.
- Bruschetta.

01:01:42.874 --> 01:01:44.739
Bruschetta. Nick, my friend.

01:01:44.976 --> 01:01:46.500
- Enzo.
- And Connie.

01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:50.206
This place is filled
with beautiful women.

01:01:50.482 --> 01:01:53.383
You and Russell work together?

01:01:53.585 --> 01:01:57.817
He's an interesting guy.
And a beautiful voice too.

01:01:58.023 --> 01:02:00.890
- Thank you.
- I'll be back with the specials.

01:02:02.527 --> 01:02:06.520
- Would you like...?
- With little Nicky and the ADD thing?

01:02:06.731 --> 01:02:10.167
Does he need Ritalin?
Could he grow out of it?

01:02:10.402 --> 01:02:13.894
Yeah. We've done
all the allergy tests. Honey?

01:02:14.105 --> 01:02:17.165
He's not allergic
to chocolate or wheat.

01:02:17.409 --> 01:02:21.505
I think he should be okay.
Maybe some sort of relaxation.

01:02:21.746 --> 01:02:24.840
- Summer camp?
- He's focused on the ice.

01:02:25.083 --> 01:02:29.349
He got cross-checked in the first
period and he remembered.

01:02:29.554 --> 01:02:32.717
Third period,
he zeroed in on that punk.

01:02:32.924 --> 01:02:37.054
He got a five-minute major.
Very focused, tough individual.

01:02:37.262 --> 01:02:40.254
- Little man in a big man's shoes.
- You okay?

01:02:40.532 --> 01:02:43.262
I guess their kid plays hockey.

01:02:44.569 --> 01:02:49.302
- You play sports?
- I bowled when I was an alcoholic.

01:02:50.742 --> 01:02:51.970
Did it help?

01:02:56.114 --> 01:02:58.275
- This is ridiculous.
- What is?

01:02:59.818 --> 01:03:01.809
Would you like to join us?

01:03:02.754 --> 01:03:05.382
Well, not a drink, but...

01:03:05.890 --> 01:03:07.448
Honey?

01:03:07.792 --> 01:03:11.626
- I'd really appreciate it.
- Why not?

01:03:13.231 --> 01:03:18.294
I wouldn't trade it for anything.
That was a great way to grow up...

01:03:18.503 --> 01:03:22.166
...with no electricity
or running water or anything.

01:03:22.407 --> 01:03:26.309
My grandfather was raised
on a reservation in Oklahoma.

01:03:26.578 --> 01:03:31.880
Is that where the alcohol problem began?
It must've been hard, socially.

01:03:32.083 --> 01:03:33.948
- Not at all.
- We drink a lot.

01:03:34.152 --> 01:03:37.121
I don't, but the guys at work do.

01:03:37.322 --> 01:03:41.759
- It's more a spiritual thing.
- Was that a problem at school?

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:44.622
- What, liquor?
- No, being Indian.

01:03:44.829 --> 01:03:47.093
- Half.
- I'm sorry. Nick said...

01:03:47.332 --> 01:03:49.664
No, don't apologize. I'm half.

01:03:49.934 --> 01:03:51.458
- Right.
- My dad's Irish.

01:03:51.669 --> 01:03:54.263
- Your mom's...?
- My mom's Choctaw.

01:03:54.506 --> 01:03:56.667
- Choctop.
- Choctaw. Not Choctop.

01:03:56.875 --> 01:03:58.809
I thought you said Choctop.

01:03:59.010 --> 01:04:02.275
My grandmother's Italian,
and that's hard.

01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:05.108
- In the '50s...
- It's hard to be Italian?

01:04:05.350 --> 01:04:06.874
No. I love it.

01:04:07.118 --> 01:04:12.146
I don't speak it or anything.
It was hard for them, the acceptance.

01:04:12.357 --> 01:04:16.123
- Tastes like chicken.
- They say that about crocodile.

01:04:16.327 --> 01:04:20.320
My dear friends. We have
many requests for another song.

01:04:20.799 --> 01:04:24.064
Russell, would you do another for us?

01:05:09.747 --> 01:05:14.946
Don't ever call me at work again.
Don't ever go to Sorrento's again.

01:05:15.186 --> 01:05:17.051
- Fine.
- What do you need?

01:05:17.288 --> 01:05:18.687
I told Russell.

01:05:19.624 --> 01:05:21.751
- You told him what?
- About us.

01:05:25.930 --> 01:05:30.526
Why did you do that?
Why would you do something like that?

01:05:31.636 --> 01:05:35.231
What are you, fucking nuts?
Why would you do that?

01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:38.238
Tell me why you'd do... Are you sick?

01:05:40.378 --> 01:05:45.782
Last night was a major moment in our
marriage. We reached this honesty...

01:05:45.984 --> 01:05:50.478
...and he shared something with me
that was unbelievably personal.

01:05:50.722 --> 01:05:52.087
What?!

01:05:52.657 --> 01:05:54.488
Like I'm gonna tell you.

01:05:55.493 --> 01:05:58.792
It was important I share
with him in return.

01:05:58.997 --> 01:06:02.899
You know I gotta work with this guy?
We work together!

01:06:03.501 --> 01:06:06.993
I know. It's okay. He's not upset.

01:06:10.341 --> 01:06:12.138
Yeah, right!

01:06:12.410 --> 01:06:15.243
- He's all right about it.
- Bullshit!

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:20.440
You understand? It's never all right!
I'm a man! He's a man! Trust me!

01:06:20.685 --> 01:06:24.121
It's never all right. Ever! Ever!

01:06:24.322 --> 01:06:28.918
- He was moved that I was so honest.
- Oh, Jesus!

01:06:29.327 --> 01:06:32.490
- He surprises me.
- Maybe it's for the best.

01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:36.394
Assuming that Russell
doesn't shoot me in the eyes...

01:06:36.601 --> 01:06:39.832
...l'll change.
I haven't been the best husband.

01:06:40.038 --> 01:06:45.169
I acted on the occasional wrong impulse.
I've taken the detour...

01:06:45.376 --> 01:06:47.503
I'm way too sober for this.

01:07:12.370 --> 01:07:15.999
I wanna say something
then you do what you must.

01:07:16.207 --> 01:07:18.334
I must be losing my mind.

01:07:18.543 --> 01:07:22.206
To do that to another controller
is inexcusable.

01:07:22.413 --> 01:07:25.576
It was 99% alcohol...
You don't wanna hear that.

01:07:25.817 --> 01:07:29.184
I don't even wanna hear it or say it.

01:07:29.420 --> 01:07:33.982
Whatever we have to do to make it
right, I wanna make it right.

01:07:34.826 --> 01:07:37.317
So if you wanna take a swing at me...

01:07:38.596 --> 01:07:42.327
...I want you to know,
I wouldn't swing back.

01:07:43.835 --> 01:07:45.234
Come on.

01:07:46.404 --> 01:07:47.530
It's okay.

01:07:48.273 --> 01:07:50.070
Have a seat.

01:07:54.679 --> 01:07:56.169
Sit with me.

01:08:06.858 --> 01:08:09.588
It's okay. Sit with me.

01:08:26.310 --> 01:08:29.803
My grandfather said,
"If you wanna sleep at night...

01:08:30.048 --> 01:08:32.778
...don't marry a young, beautiful woman."

01:08:33.484 --> 01:08:35.281
Well, I did.

01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:39.917
A 40-year-old man, I married
a beautiful 19-year-old girl.

01:08:40.158 --> 01:08:43.821
I've learned to accept things.
I know the dangers.

01:08:44.328 --> 01:08:49.767
I've also been on the other side,
the one following the little pink panties.

01:08:51.402 --> 01:08:54.667
It's torturous. We're men.
We can't help it.

01:08:55.773 --> 01:08:57.604
It's not fair.

01:09:02.447 --> 01:09:04.915
We have a huge burden on us.

01:09:05.183 --> 01:09:08.640
Jesus, you're being incredible
about this, Bell.

01:09:09.953 --> 01:09:13.082
I mean, amazing. Really.

01:09:13.424 --> 01:09:17.827
You're married to a beautiful woman.
You should understand.

01:09:18.863 --> 01:09:22.424
- Connie?
- Yeah, Connie.

01:09:22.934 --> 01:09:26.596
I mean, she's gorgeous.
My God, she's gorgeous.

01:09:26.804 --> 01:09:29.705
You must go crazy
when men gawk at her.

01:09:31.843 --> 01:09:33.868
If this happened to you...

01:09:34.345 --> 01:09:39.510
...if you were in this situation,
you'd understand.

01:09:39.884 --> 01:09:43.115
You might not like it,
but you'd understand.

01:09:45.823 --> 01:09:49.189
- I don't think I would.
- You might be surprised.

01:09:49.394 --> 01:09:51.122
I really don't think so.

01:09:51.328 --> 01:09:54.560
Human beings can tolerate
a lot of pain.

01:09:55.867 --> 01:09:58.495
You never know until it happens.

01:10:19.690 --> 01:10:22.158
- Hi there.
- How you doing?

01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:25.989
Fine. Nick invited me for lunch.

01:10:26.197 --> 01:10:28.665
It's a beautiful day for it.

01:10:29.500 --> 01:10:32.901
With your complexion,
you must get a great tan.

01:10:33.104 --> 01:10:37.234
I spend 10 minutes outside,
they have to do skin grafts.

01:10:38.910 --> 01:10:42.778
- Where'd you learn to sing like that?
- I'm sorry?

01:10:43.014 --> 01:10:45.175
Your singing was beautiful.

01:10:45.383 --> 01:10:49.911
My father. He was a professional
singer, among other things.

01:10:50.388 --> 01:10:54.722
- What are you listening to?
- French tapes.

01:10:56.127 --> 01:10:58.254
You're learning French?

01:11:00.097 --> 01:11:03.260
- I like to learn new things.
- Me too.

01:11:04.101 --> 01:11:07.366
- You speak it?
- French? Me? No.

01:11:07.605 --> 01:11:12.736
I've always wanted to learn, though.
They say it's the language of love.

01:11:12.944 --> 01:11:15.606
I'm not sure how much I love it.

01:11:16.881 --> 01:11:18.473
But...

01:11:22.553 --> 01:11:24.544
That is nice.

01:11:27.758 --> 01:11:32.661
If you're interested,
I'll loan you these when I'm finished.

01:11:33.397 --> 01:11:37.060
- That might be fun.
- What might be fun, sweetheart?

01:11:37.735 --> 01:11:40.397
- Hi, baby.
- Bye.

01:11:45.843 --> 01:11:47.276
Hi, Russell.

01:11:50.081 --> 01:11:51.275
Au revoir.

01:11:54.819 --> 01:11:57.151
What might be fun, sweetheart?

01:11:57.355 --> 01:11:58.822
What might be fun?

01:11:59.023 --> 01:12:04.461
Oh, Russell? He's got French tapes
he's gonna loan me. Be able to...

01:12:04.829 --> 01:12:08.458
You barely know the guy.
You call him Russell?

01:12:08.666 --> 01:12:11.692
I know him.
What's your problem with him?

01:12:11.936 --> 01:12:13.301
I don't have one.

01:12:13.504 --> 01:12:17.702
He's a lowlife, but that's
his problem. It's not mine.

01:12:18.809 --> 01:12:22.142
- I don't like what he said about you.
- What?

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:26.339
- He said you were attractive.
- Really?

01:12:27.618 --> 01:12:30.610
- He used the word "attractive"?
- Yes, he did.

01:12:33.057 --> 01:12:37.118
- What was the context...?
- The context was... I don't remember.

01:12:37.328 --> 01:12:40.024
- Right.
- That was the context.

01:12:40.498 --> 01:12:44.298
I got 30 minutes.
I don't wanna talk about him.

01:12:44.535 --> 01:12:47.527
We'll talk about
what you wanna talk about.

01:12:51.142 --> 01:12:54.043
Does he call you
Connie or Mrs. Falzone?

01:12:54.245 --> 01:12:56.509
No, honey. It's "babycakes."

01:13:00.685 --> 01:13:03.415
Tommy boy,
I haven't seen you in years.

01:13:03.654 --> 01:13:06.680
- No kidding.
- What are you doing here?

01:13:06.891 --> 01:13:09.724
- I'm filling in tonight.
- Who for?

01:13:09.927 --> 01:13:11.326
Bell.

01:13:15.066 --> 01:13:20.265
- Where'd he have to go tonight?
- I don't know. He called me to switch.

01:13:21.872 --> 01:13:23.863
Well, is he sick?

01:13:24.175 --> 01:13:25.904
No, he sounded good.

01:13:28.079 --> 01:13:31.207
Hello. This is the Falzone residence.

01:13:31.415 --> 01:13:36.546
We're not in, but leave your name
and number and we'll call you back.

01:13:36.754 --> 01:13:38.551
How do you turn it off?

01:13:38.756 --> 01:13:42.192
You there? You screening?
Don't screen. Pick up.

01:13:42.393 --> 01:13:43.883
Nicky?

01:13:44.695 --> 01:13:46.356
Connie?

01:13:48.432 --> 01:13:50.696
Okay, talk to you later. Bye.

01:13:55.573 --> 01:13:57.438
Bonjour.

01:13:58.542 --> 01:14:03.536
Let's welcome to tonight's Muscle
Queen contest, three young ladies...

01:14:03.781 --> 01:14:07.615
...whose mission it is
to tone the whole body.

01:14:07.885 --> 01:14:12.219
I don't know. I think she's
screwing around with Russell.

01:14:19.497 --> 01:14:21.397
Connie and Russell Bell?

01:14:21.599 --> 01:14:26.798
- Okay, what do you got?
- Nothing concrete. I got a gut feeling.

01:14:27.471 --> 01:14:30.463
- That's not...
- Connie's crazy about you.

01:14:30.675 --> 01:14:35.578
Besides, only scum would screw around
with another controller's wife.

01:14:35.913 --> 01:14:40.282
- There are exceptions to every rule.
- What's wrong with you?

01:14:41.585 --> 01:14:45.578
And now, our first contestant,
Miss Tina Leary.

01:14:59.437 --> 01:15:01.701
I did something stupid.

01:15:01.972 --> 01:15:04.805
- What did you do?
- Like, really stupid.

01:15:11.282 --> 01:15:14.149
I ran into Mary Bell
at the supermarket.

01:15:15.052 --> 01:15:18.544
She was upset over a plant.
She was a mess.

01:15:18.789 --> 01:15:22.122
Forget about the plant.
You know how she looks.

01:15:22.326 --> 01:15:27.059
I felt sorry for her. We went
to dinner. We had too much to drink...

01:15:27.331 --> 01:15:31.665
Okay, wait.
You bopped Mary Bell? Did you?

01:15:33.537 --> 01:15:35.232
Just once.

01:15:44.415 --> 01:15:47.043
A controller's wife. I broke the rule.

01:15:47.318 --> 01:15:50.719
At least you're disgusted
with your behavior.

01:15:50.921 --> 01:15:55.324
That's something, isn't it?
It counts for something.

01:15:55.526 --> 01:15:59.462
That'll teach Russell
to take on more planes than you.

01:15:59.663 --> 01:16:04.157
- I think he's trying to...
- You're starting to worry me.

01:16:05.102 --> 01:16:07.332
You're starting to worry me.

01:16:08.773 --> 01:16:13.107
This job can get to people.
Sometimes this job gets to people.

01:16:13.911 --> 01:16:17.369
- The universe tends towards chaos.
- What?

01:16:17.581 --> 01:16:19.845
It tends towards chaos.

01:16:20.050 --> 01:16:24.612
We're the last line of defense
against chaos in the sky.

01:16:25.723 --> 01:16:28.453
It can be too much of a burden.

01:16:28.726 --> 01:16:33.026
You know? It can be more
than the human mind...

01:16:33.230 --> 01:16:36.290
Yeah, I know what you mean. I got it.

01:16:39.537 --> 01:16:42.267
You're not screwing my wife, are you?

01:16:44.275 --> 01:16:45.606
This is crazy.

01:16:48.078 --> 01:16:50.273
Baby, you look so good!

01:16:51.115 --> 01:16:52.605
Connie?

01:16:58.923 --> 01:17:00.481
What's going on?

01:17:04.895 --> 01:17:07.591
Everything okay? Hey, buddy.

01:17:07.798 --> 01:17:12.565
- Run along. I need to talk to Daddy.
- Hey, Dr. T.

01:17:15.739 --> 01:17:18.230
- What is it?
- Sit down, Nick.

01:17:21.979 --> 01:17:26.973
I've been explaining to the kids
what it means that Daddy...

01:17:28.252 --> 01:17:30.686
...won't be around anymore.

01:17:37.695 --> 01:17:39.526
Hey, Connie.

01:17:40.297 --> 01:17:41.662
Wait a minute.

01:17:45.836 --> 01:17:48.703
Do you even wanna hear
my side of this?

01:17:49.306 --> 01:17:52.434
What's your side of my father dying?

01:17:58.515 --> 01:18:02.417
- It's a terrible shock.
- He's been sick for three years.

01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:04.349
You're never prepared.

01:18:04.555 --> 01:18:09.390
Don't worry. They can stay
with Laura and Kevin.

01:18:09.627 --> 01:18:13.723
But I gotta leave tomorrow.
So I've left three casseroles...

01:18:13.964 --> 01:18:17.661
- You assume I'm not going?
- You never take time off...

01:18:17.868 --> 01:18:20.200
I'll take time off.

01:18:22.740 --> 01:18:25.402
- I'll take time off.
- You sure?

01:18:27.578 --> 01:18:29.569
I got these for you.

01:18:32.049 --> 01:18:35.576
- Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, no, no.

01:18:37.988 --> 01:18:41.048
Oh, my daddy's gone.

01:19:12.189 --> 01:19:13.850
Was that French?

01:19:14.091 --> 01:19:15.615
What?

01:19:15.926 --> 01:19:18.554
Did you say goodbye in French?

01:19:18.762 --> 01:19:21.925
- Yes. I did.
- That's lovely, Connie.

01:19:34.812 --> 01:19:39.909
I'll never forget the first night I met him.
He was a wonderful man.

01:19:40.117 --> 01:19:44.577
He said he thought no man
was good enough for his daughter.

01:19:44.822 --> 01:19:47.950
Then he met me, and he was sure of it.

01:19:48.459 --> 01:19:52.987
He said, "If you're not good enough
for her, then no one is."

01:19:54.264 --> 01:19:56.494
He had a sense of humor.

01:19:57.301 --> 01:20:00.464
He spoke his mind. He wasn't devious.

01:20:01.505 --> 01:20:04.338
He didn't sneak around
behind your back.

01:20:04.575 --> 01:20:08.170
He didn't ride around on a motorcycle.

01:20:24.762 --> 01:20:27.356
I didn't realize you knew French.

01:20:29.199 --> 01:20:32.293
I've been listening to tapes for weeks.

01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:34.669
Tapes.

01:20:35.105 --> 01:20:38.040
Russell Bell, he loaned them to me.

01:20:38.375 --> 01:20:42.835
- That was considerate of him.
- What is it with you?

01:20:43.147 --> 01:20:44.671
At this time...

01:20:45.149 --> 01:20:49.279
- It's like you don't trust me anymore.
- What are you saying?

01:20:56.660 --> 01:21:00.323
I read that when a person does not...

01:21:01.231 --> 01:21:03.222
...trust another person...

01:21:04.368 --> 01:21:08.202
...it's because they, themselves...
- They themselves what?

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:13.667
Are you turning this around
so it's about me?

01:21:14.211 --> 01:21:15.735
Is it, Nick?

01:21:18.582 --> 01:21:22.814
- Is this about you?
- What are you talking about?

01:21:26.924 --> 01:21:29.085
You look me in the eye...

01:21:31.228 --> 01:21:34.322
...and tell me you've
never cheated on me.

01:21:35.065 --> 01:21:36.828
Come on.

01:21:40.671 --> 01:21:42.263
You want me to...

01:22:02.092 --> 01:22:06.859
I'm gonna be sick. I'm gonna be...
I'm gonna be sick.

01:22:08.198 --> 01:22:10.393
This is not okay.

01:22:12.703 --> 01:22:14.295
You are an asshole!

01:22:14.538 --> 01:22:18.304
- Capital A-S-H...
- Stop hitting me!

01:22:18.542 --> 01:22:20.942
Asshole! O-L-E!

01:22:27.784 --> 01:22:32.050
The captain, here.
Shortly, we'll be descending.

01:22:32.289 --> 01:22:35.452
The cabin crew will complete...

01:22:35.759 --> 01:22:39.889
I know it's too early
to ask you to forgive me.

01:22:40.097 --> 01:22:45.262
But do you think you could someday
imagine starting to think about it?

01:22:45.469 --> 01:22:50.270
I just want you to know
that if the situation were reversed...

01:22:50.474 --> 01:22:54.843
...in my heart I'd forgive you.
- There's nothing to forgive.

01:22:55.078 --> 01:22:59.174
- What do you mean?
- Wanna know why? Because I did it too.

01:22:59.650 --> 01:23:03.780
Russell et moi. We did the deed.

01:23:03.987 --> 01:23:09.084
Le grand of freaky-frick.
We went all over the house.

01:23:09.293 --> 01:23:13.161
We went upside down.
We went sideways.

01:23:13.363 --> 01:23:16.093
We should have worn helmets.

01:23:23.473 --> 01:23:26.840
- What's going on?
- Didn't mean a thing.

01:23:27.044 --> 01:23:32.277
No, this plane. I called. The TRACON's
supposed to bring us straight in.

01:23:32.482 --> 01:23:36.885
We've been informed there's
traffic ahead at the airport.

01:23:37.154 --> 01:23:39.987
They've asked us to delay our landing.

01:23:40.724 --> 01:23:44.057
It shouldn't be long.
We'll keep you advised.

01:23:44.294 --> 01:23:47.821
Guess I get to spend quality time
with my husband.

01:23:56.206 --> 01:23:58.470
Who's on approach right now?

01:23:58.675 --> 01:24:01.735
The captain's turned
on the seat belt sign.

01:24:01.979 --> 01:24:05.710
We're experiencing a few bumps.
It'll be over soon.

01:24:11.388 --> 01:24:13.413
This is crazy.

01:24:13.924 --> 01:24:17.860
They don't even fit me anymore.
Where are you going?

01:24:18.428 --> 01:24:20.726
I need a drink of water.

01:24:25.335 --> 01:24:28.532
The "fasten seat belt" sign is on.
Sit down!

01:24:28.739 --> 01:24:33.574
- I'm with TRACON. Plane's in danger.
- Is that a threat?

01:24:33.777 --> 01:24:37.008
The man in control
is under emotional strain.

01:24:37.214 --> 01:24:41.810
- The captain's fine.
- You think the captain's in control?

01:24:42.019 --> 01:24:46.217
- Return to your seat.
- I need to talk to the captain.

01:24:46.423 --> 01:24:48.891
- Sir, sit down!
- Just 20 seconds.

01:24:49.126 --> 01:24:53.290
- Right now!
- Okay. All right. I will.

01:24:57.234 --> 01:25:01.193
- Captain!
- You are not allowed in there! Sir!

01:25:02.606 --> 01:25:06.770
- Return to your seat or...
- It's being put in bad...

01:25:06.977 --> 01:25:10.606
This plane's being put
in bad weather intentionally!

01:25:10.814 --> 01:25:13.282
The controller has lost his mind!

01:25:15.152 --> 01:25:18.485
- No water?
- They had sparkling. I want flat.

01:25:19.323 --> 01:25:21.416
You should've asked nicely.

01:25:21.625 --> 01:25:26.961
- I have to go to the washroom.
- You can't drink from the washroom!

01:25:27.164 --> 01:25:31.260
I'm going to ask the flight crew
to buckle in.

01:25:31.468 --> 01:25:33.060
A little turbulence.

01:25:40.844 --> 01:25:43.312
Captain! Listen to me!

01:25:43.513 --> 01:25:48.644
I have the proper identification!
I'm an air traffic controller!

01:25:48.852 --> 01:25:53.812
There's an unstable man
on the ground controlling this plane!

01:25:54.024 --> 01:25:56.322
I gotta talk to the captain!

01:25:56.526 --> 01:26:00.053
We've just been cleared to land.

01:26:00.263 --> 01:26:03.994
Will you please just give the man
a drink of water?

01:26:04.201 --> 01:26:06.362
- Sit down!
- I'll get it myself.

01:26:06.603 --> 01:26:10.630
Thank you for your patience.
Thanks for flying Dynajet.

01:26:22.686 --> 01:26:26.850
...we're looking at snow
at least until rush hour.

01:26:27.057 --> 01:26:30.117
The accumulation
is already five inches.

01:26:30.327 --> 01:26:33.194
I need an alternate route in tonight.

01:26:37.134 --> 01:26:41.696
Somebody on the scopes
is about to go on mental health leave.

01:26:45.475 --> 01:26:50.879
Airport conditions: One inch
of hard-packed snow on all runways.

01:26:51.081 --> 01:26:54.915
Runways cleared for three landings
before replowing.

01:26:55.152 --> 01:26:59.213
Tower advises visual range
of 1/4 mile at 2000 feet...

01:27:26.783 --> 01:27:28.216
Morton.

01:27:31.621 --> 01:27:33.612
Repeat, please.

01:27:34.724 --> 01:27:36.555
Who is this? How...?

01:27:46.536 --> 01:27:48.231
Hey, Falzone.

01:27:56.947 --> 01:28:00.542
Were you on approach last night
around 1:00 a.m.?

01:28:05.622 --> 01:28:08.557
- What are you doing?
- Wrong answer?

01:28:08.758 --> 01:28:10.419
- Nick!
- Knock it off!

01:28:10.627 --> 01:28:13.528
- What are you doing?
- Nick, come on!

01:28:13.730 --> 01:28:18.258
- Leo, we gotta talk!
- There's a bomb in the building.

01:28:23.073 --> 01:28:24.267
- What?
- A what?

01:28:24.474 --> 01:28:29.502
- We just got a call. There's a bomb.
- Well, that's a hoax.

01:28:29.746 --> 01:28:33.910
- It came in on the secure line.
- I just wet myself.

01:28:34.117 --> 01:28:35.141
That was me.

01:28:35.418 --> 01:28:38.854
Take out this place,
and you close the whole sky.

01:28:39.089 --> 01:28:42.286
The guy said it's good to go at 11:00.

01:28:42.492 --> 01:28:45.359
- What do we do?
- We clear the building.

01:28:45.595 --> 01:28:48.359
We're stopping all takeoffs.

01:28:48.598 --> 01:28:51.624
Central Flow's holding
all incoming flights.

01:28:52.269 --> 01:28:54.965
All we gotta do is land or reroute...

01:28:55.171 --> 01:28:58.937
...every plane in our airspace
within the next...

01:28:59.643 --> 01:29:01.270
...26 minutes.

01:29:01.511 --> 01:29:05.538
Listen. I know I can't ask
any of you to stay...

01:29:05.782 --> 01:29:10.014
...but I need two volunteers
to handle approach. We can do it.

01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:11.278
It'll be fun.

01:29:12.022 --> 01:29:16.220
These guys are coming in
with close to zero visibility.

01:29:17.127 --> 01:29:21.291
The human body has a finite capacity
for handling stress.

01:29:21.565 --> 01:29:25.467
I don't mind losing my health,
but I wanna keep my ass.

01:29:25.669 --> 01:29:26.727
I'll stay.

01:29:26.970 --> 01:29:28.062
- Good.
- I'll stay.

01:29:28.305 --> 01:29:29.704
- Not him!
- Why not?

01:29:29.906 --> 01:29:33.842
- We'll talk later. Let Barry do it!
- I'm fine.

01:29:34.711 --> 01:29:38.477
- I like Russell's idea.
- Russell's on. Come on, clear.

01:29:39.182 --> 01:29:41.673
Move away from the building.

01:29:44.754 --> 01:29:47.188
Get behind the yellow tape.

01:29:47.424 --> 01:29:49.483
Move away from the building.

01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:58.997
Hold those people back!

01:30:00.337 --> 01:30:03.864
Here's the bomb squad.
I'm gonna get some answers.

01:30:04.107 --> 01:30:07.736
Sir, how many controllers
are in the building?

01:30:07.944 --> 01:30:09.411
We got two.

01:30:12.849 --> 01:30:16.216
Come on! You rolling? Okay.

01:30:16.453 --> 01:30:19.513
There are two controllers...

01:30:19.723 --> 01:30:22.055
...inside the threatened facility...

01:30:22.459 --> 01:30:25.553
...who are frantically
and very courageously...

01:30:25.762 --> 01:30:29.061
...guiding aloft planes to safety.

01:30:29.265 --> 01:30:32.894
- Go to 4000.
- Turn right heading 330, speed 180.

01:30:33.103 --> 01:30:36.869
Delta 2202, left heading 040.
Maintain 4000.

01:30:37.073 --> 01:30:40.509
No. I can't take any more
unless fuel emergency.

01:30:40.710 --> 01:30:45.306
Pull Delta. I can take it.
Northwest 2442, Newark altimeter 2891.

01:30:45.582 --> 01:30:50.417
3861, traffic below at 4000.
What the fuck's wrong with you?

01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:55.819
Eagle 49, proceed to outer marker,
ILS runway four. Fuck you, Russell!

01:31:05.001 --> 01:31:08.664
- Turn, Northwest.
- He's in the turn. Go to two.

01:31:08.905 --> 01:31:11.965
- What did I do?
- Save it for the hearing!

01:31:15.578 --> 01:31:18.672
- You'll go down in flames!
- Kiss my ass!

01:31:18.948 --> 01:31:20.609
United. That wasn't to you.

01:31:24.654 --> 01:31:27.179
- What is it?
- Enjoy your last session!

01:31:27.424 --> 01:31:30.484
- What?!
- Will you take that thing off?!

01:31:30.694 --> 01:31:33.663
- Give me my feather!
- You can't have it.

01:31:33.863 --> 01:31:36.195
1361, you're clear for approach.

01:31:36.933 --> 01:31:39.197
- You don't need it!
- Give it to me!

01:31:39.436 --> 01:31:42.769
- Your luck's run out!
- Why do you take my shit?

01:31:43.006 --> 01:31:46.464
- You Riverdance motherfucker!
- Give me my feather!

01:31:46.676 --> 01:31:49.543
It's mine. It's mine.
You can't have it.

01:31:53.016 --> 01:31:57.112
- 2297 to 6000.
Here we go. 1077245...

01:31:57.320 --> 01:32:00.153
- Shit!
- Jesus Christ!

01:32:00.457 --> 01:32:02.891
Switch over to the main speaker.

01:32:06.196 --> 01:32:09.461
Continental 2130,
137 miles from marker...

01:32:31.421 --> 01:32:33.218
- I'm clear.
- Me too.

01:32:34.424 --> 01:32:36.415
Gotta go! Now! Get out now!

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:41.724
- Give me my feather!
- I don't want to talk about it!

01:32:41.931 --> 01:32:44.331
Sparta Air 753 checking in.

01:32:44.567 --> 01:32:47.559
Newark approach. Sparta 753.

01:32:50.707 --> 01:32:53.733
Sparta 753 checking in.
Anybody there?

01:32:55.712 --> 01:32:58.340
Sparta Air 753.

01:32:58.748 --> 01:33:02.013
It's Jethro. Sparta 753, do you read?

01:33:05.688 --> 01:33:09.954
753, this is Newark approach.
If you read, squawk ident.

01:33:10.193 --> 01:33:14.129
- He'll miss the localizer.
- He's below minimum.

01:33:14.364 --> 01:33:17.356
Sparta 753, this is Newark on 121.5.

01:33:17.934 --> 01:33:22.268
Sparta 753, Newark approach.
Sparta 753?

01:33:22.472 --> 01:33:26.067
753 has radio failure.
Can you plug me through?

01:33:26.709 --> 01:33:30.645
Shit. How about company frequency?
Thanks anyway.

01:33:31.381 --> 01:33:33.440
Communications are down.

01:33:36.085 --> 01:33:37.313
What the...?

01:33:37.754 --> 01:33:39.881
I'm gonna try the center.

01:33:42.091 --> 01:33:46.050
Center, Sparta 753 descending.
Needs a turn and a climb.

01:33:46.296 --> 01:33:51.290
We can't reach him. If you can get
to him, climb him to 2000. Thanks.

01:33:54.337 --> 01:33:55.827
Godspeed, son.

01:33:56.072 --> 01:33:59.769
753. I am not receiving.
Ya'll get fired again?

01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:14.647
Come on, Nick! Get out of there!
Get out of there!

01:34:14.858 --> 01:34:19.659
- Get down, Nick! Get down!
- It's gonna blow!

01:34:30.106 --> 01:34:31.539
What the...?

01:34:33.509 --> 01:34:35.500
Get him out of there!

01:34:36.646 --> 01:34:38.443
Get out of here!

01:34:40.283 --> 01:34:43.150
All right. All right. Where's Russell?

01:34:43.353 --> 01:34:46.652
- He came out before I did!
- No, he didn't!

01:34:46.856 --> 01:34:48.221
Operator, listen.

01:34:48.524 --> 01:34:52.688
Connect me with Sparta Base
Operations in Greensboro.

01:35:14.517 --> 01:35:16.576
The pilot?

01:35:17.520 --> 01:35:20.353
Who shall I say is calling?

01:35:26.763 --> 01:35:30.927
Sparta Air 753,
ILS runway four, left.

01:35:42.712 --> 01:35:46.876
Everybody, get down! Stay down!
Get behind the vehicle.

01:35:47.951 --> 01:35:49.748
Get back, people. Down.

01:35:49.953 --> 01:35:53.354
- My God, he made it!
- Look, it's Russell!

01:35:56.025 --> 01:35:59.552
Please! Stay back behind the line!

01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.941
What happened? Are you okay?

01:36:15.144 --> 01:36:18.944
After a search of the building,
no bomb was found.

01:36:19.215 --> 01:36:20.978
The call was a hoax...

01:36:21.217 --> 01:36:26.314
...that put many lives at risk
in the sky and in air traffic control.

01:36:26.589 --> 01:36:29.387
While controllers ran
for their lives...

01:36:29.592 --> 01:36:32.755
...one man guided
the pilots to safety.

01:36:32.962 --> 01:36:37.422
Russell Bell, what made you stay
as time was running out?

01:36:37.633 --> 01:36:38.657
It's my job.

01:36:40.103 --> 01:36:44.301
While the identity of the hoax caller
is unknown, New York has identified...

01:36:44.674 --> 01:36:46.141
Perfect. Perfect.

01:36:50.346 --> 01:36:51.574
Come on.

01:36:51.814 --> 01:36:53.145
Come on.

01:36:54.751 --> 01:36:58.778
The kids and I are going
to Felicia's for a while.

01:37:00.990 --> 01:37:06.428
- Come on, this is crazy.
- I left some casseroles in the fridge.

01:37:06.829 --> 01:37:08.854
Put the suitcases away, okay?

01:37:09.098 --> 01:37:11.157
- I've lost you.
- I'm here.

01:37:11.367 --> 01:37:13.858
- This is not...
- I'm right here.

01:37:14.103 --> 01:37:18.267
It's not all about the cheating, okay?

01:37:19.675 --> 01:37:24.442
You know, I think that's
messed you up more than it has me.

01:37:25.181 --> 01:37:29.117
- Put the suitcase down, sweetie.
- We used to be...

01:37:29.352 --> 01:37:31.286
...so much in love, Nick.

01:37:31.487 --> 01:37:35.719
And anything less than that,
it just feels like nothing.

01:37:35.958 --> 01:37:39.689
- Do you understand?
- You're making a big mistake.

01:37:39.896 --> 01:37:43.627
- Do you understand?
- No, and you don't either!

01:37:44.333 --> 01:37:47.791
- Motherfuck...
- Why do I bother, you know?

01:37:49.672 --> 01:37:51.537
You're gonna leave?!

01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:58.369
Is there anything even
in those suitcases? Connie?

01:37:58.648 --> 01:38:02.584
You know I'm gonna make this up
to you, don't you?

01:38:05.221 --> 01:38:08.918
- You all work with Russell?
- I'm right there.

01:38:09.525 --> 01:38:13.359
I said something good about you
but it got cut out.

01:38:13.563 --> 01:38:17.226
- See the guy with the hat right there?
- Hey, sweetie.

01:38:17.433 --> 01:38:19.663
I'll have a double tequila.

01:38:21.003 --> 01:38:24.734
Russell's gone.
He took off with that crazy wife.

01:38:24.941 --> 01:38:28.877
- Russell Bell is a hero.
I must say, I think he is.

01:38:29.112 --> 01:38:31.842
We've tried to find out more about...

01:38:48.731 --> 01:38:51.461
3451, turn left heading 060. Expedite!

01:38:54.971 --> 01:38:56.598
Mother...!

01:38:58.307 --> 01:39:02.038
- What's the matter?
- This TWA got in my airspace.

01:39:02.245 --> 01:39:06.204
- He's got a data block.
- He was supposed to be at 5000.

01:39:06.415 --> 01:39:08.713
- Tommy, sit down for Nick.
- Sure.

01:39:08.918 --> 01:39:10.749
- Zone.
- I don't need him.

01:39:10.953 --> 01:39:15.583
- Let's go have coffee.
- It had to be an operational error!

01:39:15.791 --> 01:39:19.818
- You had a deal.
- Yesterday, he lands a zillion planes.

01:39:20.062 --> 01:39:23.122
Today, he takes two
and almost crashes them.

01:39:23.332 --> 01:39:27.735
I'm going to work. I had a deal.
So you've slapped my wrist.

01:39:27.970 --> 01:39:32.930
- Do the paperwork and let me get back.
- Why don't you take today off?

01:39:33.142 --> 01:39:37.476
- Go play with the wife.
- Just make sure it's your wife.

01:39:39.582 --> 01:39:40.981
What?

01:39:43.186 --> 01:39:45.586
- Who's ready?
- I am.

01:39:49.358 --> 01:39:52.452
He's a go-around.
Landing gear not green.

01:39:52.662 --> 01:39:56.189
Also, focus here on USAir 4844
and United 2417.

01:40:11.447 --> 01:40:16.282
Nick, are you all right?
Are you on that? Are you on that?!

01:40:17.620 --> 01:40:20.680
- USAir 4844, descend 3000.
- What's going on?

01:40:20.890 --> 01:40:23.825
2417, turn right heading 120.
Correction.

01:40:24.026 --> 01:40:28.520
2417, turn right heading 220.
Resequencing for runway 04, right.

01:40:28.998 --> 01:40:33.025
- You want to pull the tapes?
- There's nothing to hear, so...

01:40:33.502 --> 01:40:35.629
I want you to go home.

01:40:37.807 --> 01:40:38.865
Home?

01:40:39.075 --> 01:40:43.512
You get three deals in two years
and then I gotta yank you.

01:40:44.647 --> 01:40:49.607
- Go home. You're dangerous right now.
- Just get some rest, Zone.

01:40:49.819 --> 01:40:52.515
It's a slow day. We can handle it.

01:40:55.258 --> 01:41:00.093
- I'll come back in the morning.
- Come back when you're ready.

01:41:28.891 --> 01:41:31.883
- Front door's open.
- Hey, Barry.

01:41:32.261 --> 01:41:36.357
- Place looks great.
- Come on, have a seat.

01:41:39.035 --> 01:41:41.902
See? That's an endurance contest.

01:41:42.104 --> 01:41:44.629
Straight knockout competition.

01:41:44.907 --> 01:41:48.434
They burn themselves with the sand
and the cactus...

01:41:48.644 --> 01:41:52.410
...and the magnifying glass
on the nipples. But, see...

01:41:52.615 --> 01:41:58.053
...there's no order to the torture.
But that doesn't matter because...

01:41:58.287 --> 01:42:03.088
...it's who's gonna fall first.
It's a point or a demerit system.

01:42:03.292 --> 01:42:06.557
But it's... That's what...
What else can it be?

01:42:08.731 --> 01:42:11.757
It's good you're taking time off.

01:42:12.568 --> 01:42:16.561
You look great.
You were getting tense there.

01:42:17.006 --> 01:42:20.339
And that day you kicked
Russell in the butt...

01:42:22.144 --> 01:42:24.977
- We can laugh about it.
- Laugh at what?

01:42:25.181 --> 01:42:28.639
- When you kicked him.
- He put me in a thunderstorm.

01:42:28.851 --> 01:42:30.546
Is that what you think?

01:42:30.753 --> 01:42:36.157
He had a medical emergency on ASR
approach. He had to spin seven planes.

01:42:36.359 --> 01:42:40.125
The guy had a heart attack.
Russell got him down.

01:42:40.329 --> 01:42:42.422
He did a hell of a job.

01:42:50.106 --> 01:42:51.698
Leo, it's Nick.

01:42:52.508 --> 01:42:57.207
Yeah. Great, great. Do you have
any idea where Russell went?

01:42:58.714 --> 01:43:00.341
Where did he go?

01:43:02.718 --> 01:43:06.484
Operator, I'm trying to trace
a friend in Colorado.

01:43:06.689 --> 01:43:10.181
Mr. And Mrs. Russell Bell.
Yes, Bell.

01:43:11.394 --> 01:43:15.854
Meadow Creek, Colorado.
No, I just need the address.

01:43:46.896 --> 01:43:48.523
You caught one!

01:44:03.012 --> 01:44:05.003
Let me take a look.

01:44:05.214 --> 01:44:08.945
He's a big one.
You caught Moby Dick. Good work.

01:44:10.853 --> 01:44:14.016
Why'd you let him go?
He wasn't big enough?

01:44:14.223 --> 01:44:17.124
He knows I caught him, and so do I.

01:44:18.694 --> 01:44:23.757
- Don't quit on my account.
- It's too cold anyway.

01:44:24.700 --> 01:44:29.797
I called your house and Mary said
you'd be here. She sounds good.

01:44:30.639 --> 01:44:35.406
She said to tell you, "See? I told you
Colorado wasn't far enough."

01:44:35.644 --> 01:44:40.638
- That's what she said.
- What are you doing here?

01:44:41.584 --> 01:44:44.815
Do I need a reason
to see my good buddy?

01:44:51.727 --> 01:44:53.786
My life is shit.

01:44:55.564 --> 01:45:00.058
Connie left me.
She's my high school sweetheart.

01:45:00.402 --> 01:45:05.806
15 years, I never forgot an anniversary
or her birthday. Just wedding vows.

01:45:06.008 --> 01:45:10.342
And I miss the hell out of her.

01:45:10.579 --> 01:45:14.242
I had two deals in one day,
in a half-hour.

01:45:14.850 --> 01:45:16.943
One more and I'm gone.

01:45:17.753 --> 01:45:19.687
All the way gone.

01:45:21.524 --> 01:45:25.085
I keep trying to figure
this thing out because...

01:45:25.794 --> 01:45:30.128
...before you, I was "The Zone."
Everyone thought I was the best.

01:45:30.332 --> 01:45:33.426
Including me, most of the time. And...

01:45:34.603 --> 01:45:37.800
...I could always
keep my shit together.

01:45:38.007 --> 01:45:41.534
You know, control things.
Stay in control.

01:45:43.879 --> 01:45:45.779
And I've lost it.

01:45:48.384 --> 01:45:51.820
I've lost the reality of my reality.

01:45:56.158 --> 01:45:59.559
And I want my wife back.
I want me back.

01:46:01.130 --> 01:46:03.690
I got me to blame for where I am.

01:46:03.966 --> 01:46:05.524
Maybe not.

01:46:07.703 --> 01:46:10.137
We both played this stupid game.

01:46:11.807 --> 01:46:16.471
- It helped my marriage and hurt yours.
- That's true.

01:46:16.679 --> 01:46:21.378
There is a way out, but you
can't think your way out of it.

01:46:23.719 --> 01:46:25.983
Thought is your enemy.

01:46:26.388 --> 01:46:29.846
I gotta think less.
I had that thought, actually.

01:46:30.059 --> 01:46:32.027
You have to let go.

01:46:33.095 --> 01:46:34.562
Let go?

01:46:35.931 --> 01:46:38.195
- Let go of what?
- Let go of you.

01:46:39.868 --> 01:46:43.736
- What have you done for you lately?
- I'm not following.

01:46:43.939 --> 01:46:45.930
- Jump in.
- On the scopes?

01:46:46.175 --> 01:46:48.075
No, in the water.

01:46:52.114 --> 01:46:55.572
- The river?
- Yes, jump in the river.

01:46:56.051 --> 01:46:58.576
It's too cold for the fish, right?

01:46:58.787 --> 01:47:03.554
You're thinking. If you jumped in,
you'd be out by now.

01:47:03.792 --> 01:47:06.886
- What's the point?
- Jump in the river.

01:47:07.096 --> 01:47:08.393
Jump in the river!

01:47:08.597 --> 01:47:11.566
- In the river?
- Jump in the goddamn river!

01:47:11.767 --> 01:47:13.325
- I'm going in!
- Good!

01:47:13.535 --> 01:47:14.866
- It's cold!
- Jump!

01:47:15.104 --> 01:47:19.871
- What's this gotta do with my life?
- Cleanse yourself of your sins...

01:47:20.075 --> 01:47:22.270
...and be born again!

01:47:22.778 --> 01:47:24.803
That kind of thing.

01:47:28.584 --> 01:47:31.052
Bullshit, man! Bullshit!

01:47:31.587 --> 01:47:34.715
Bullshit, bullshit!
Bullshit!

01:47:34.923 --> 01:47:38.324
I didn't come 2000 miles
for acute hypothermia...

01:47:38.594 --> 01:47:42.997
...and some Sunday-school lesson
out of a fucking fortune cookie!

01:47:43.265 --> 01:47:47.725
- Forget it!
- You want me to go in? I'll go in!

01:47:48.303 --> 01:47:52.296
- It's too late.
- It's official! The results are in!

01:47:52.574 --> 01:47:54.405
You're nuts, Riverdance!

01:47:54.610 --> 01:47:59.604
I always suspected it, and now I know!
Why did you quit?

01:48:00.649 --> 01:48:02.742
Doesn't seem your style.

01:48:06.622 --> 01:48:10.183
I left because I was afraid
of one of two things:

01:48:10.426 --> 01:48:14.419
Either I was gonna kill you
or a plane full of Japanese.

01:48:17.766 --> 01:48:22.169
Well, at least I got to you.
You sure got to me.

01:48:22.771 --> 01:48:24.432
Good luck, Bell.

01:48:28.143 --> 01:48:30.509
You want your life back?

01:48:32.781 --> 01:48:36.308
- Do you really want it back?
- What's it look like?

01:48:37.619 --> 01:48:40.053
- Come on.
- Great. Fine.

01:48:40.289 --> 01:48:42.655
Anything's better than that.

01:48:45.994 --> 01:48:47.552
Where we going?

01:48:49.398 --> 01:48:53.960
Let me put it this way.
You'll wish you'd jumped in the river.

01:48:59.074 --> 01:49:04.068
All right. What do I do? Brace myself?
Should I relax? Lean in?

01:49:04.313 --> 01:49:06.474
It's a 747 coming at you.

01:49:06.715 --> 01:49:10.344
Clapping for Tinkerbell
won't make any difference.

01:49:10.552 --> 01:49:14.682
- Don't you get it?
- To tightly hold on to sanity is insane.

01:49:14.890 --> 01:49:16.380
What?

01:49:17.092 --> 01:49:21.153
- To gain control, you gotta lose it.
- I can't hear you!

01:49:49.591 --> 01:49:52.219
What was that you were saying?

01:50:06.275 --> 01:50:07.867
Thank you.

01:50:18.787 --> 01:50:21.085
Hey, how's it going, Zone?

01:50:21.356 --> 01:50:24.416
Are you gonna stay for a while today?

01:50:24.626 --> 01:50:28.153
Hey, that's very good news. Carry on.

01:50:30.799 --> 01:50:32.494
He's here.

01:50:32.968 --> 01:50:37.132
- Good to have you back.
- The rest did you some good.

01:50:37.372 --> 01:50:39.499
- How are you?
- How you doing?

01:50:39.708 --> 01:50:43.371
- Good to see you guys. You look good.
- You too, man.

01:50:43.645 --> 01:50:45.442
What the fuck?

01:50:45.948 --> 01:50:49.884
- What do you want to do?
- Where do you want me?

01:50:50.152 --> 01:50:52.347
Where do you want to be?

01:50:54.723 --> 01:50:56.691
Approach looks fun.

01:50:57.559 --> 01:50:59.959
I'm impressed.

01:51:00.162 --> 01:51:01.527
Kick some ass.

01:51:01.730 --> 01:51:04.198
- Tear them up, Zone.
- Lock and load.

01:51:05.801 --> 01:51:09.669
Canadian 1160, reduce to 180.
Traffic at your 11:00.

01:51:09.872 --> 01:51:11.840
- Hey, Pete.
- Hey, Zone.

01:51:12.074 --> 01:51:14.838
- What's cooking?
- You got three in trail.

01:51:15.043 --> 01:51:17.204
The heavy needs a turn at 10.

01:51:17.412 --> 01:51:21.314
And the overflow's closed,
so you got a full plate.

01:51:48.510 --> 01:51:51.104
- One too many cups of coffee.
- Right.

01:51:51.346 --> 01:51:54.543
- Sure.
- Stay with it. I know you can do it.

01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:07.786
- What's my name?
- What are you talking about?

01:52:08.030 --> 01:52:11.591
Come here. What's my name?

01:52:12.467 --> 01:52:14.264
Come on.

01:52:15.804 --> 01:52:18.637
- No Fly Zone.
- No Fly Zone.

01:52:18.907 --> 01:52:21.740
Not bad. Where's your money?

01:52:24.446 --> 01:52:27.813
- I had you getting to the headset.
- And then?

01:52:30.252 --> 01:52:32.243
Anybody got me making it?

01:52:34.790 --> 01:52:37.657
Nobody had me making it. Tina?

01:52:38.827 --> 01:52:41.819
I was out 5 bucks
when you left your car.

01:52:43.932 --> 01:52:45.297
Were you?

01:52:46.301 --> 01:52:49.464
- I had you making it.
- Thanks, Ed.

01:52:49.671 --> 01:52:51.798
I was the last one in.

01:52:58.680 --> 01:53:00.648
Today's your payday.

01:53:08.657 --> 01:53:11.091
Continental 2653, turn right.

01:53:11.693 --> 01:53:15.459
Correction: Turn left...

01:53:15.664 --> 01:53:18.997
...heading 28... Make that 260.

01:53:20.469 --> 01:53:25.873
- Traffic's at 12... Make that 1:00.
- That's my boy!

01:53:29.378 --> 01:53:31.437
Nick, I won!

01:53:34.549 --> 01:53:38.280
American 393, welcome to my sky.

01:53:38.487 --> 01:53:40.455
Descend and maintain 4000.

01:53:42.024 --> 01:53:46.984
USAir 2994, turn right heading 010
to join the localizer.

01:53:47.229 --> 01:53:50.062
No, with Felicia in Wisconsin.

01:53:50.332 --> 01:53:53.324
But, you know, it's all behind me now.

01:53:53.802 --> 01:53:56.202
I'm on my way back to New York...

01:53:56.405 --> 01:54:00.239
...to pick up my things
and start my new life.

01:54:00.475 --> 01:54:04.639
It's like I've been released
from prison. You know? I'm...

01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:06.472
I'm free...

01:54:07.349 --> 01:54:09.579
...and I'm independent...

01:54:10.152 --> 01:54:13.144
...and I'm facing the future alone.

01:54:13.355 --> 01:54:17.257
I have the kids. I'm exhilarated.
Tell me about you.

01:54:19.494 --> 01:54:22.520
Steve and I are on our honeymoon.

01:54:23.265 --> 01:54:25.324
- You are?
- Yes.

01:54:25.534 --> 01:54:30.665
- That's fantastic. I'm...
- The captain would like to see you.

01:54:30.906 --> 01:54:32.999
- He would?
- Yes.

01:54:36.178 --> 01:54:37.372
Would you hold...?

01:54:42.784 --> 01:54:45.048
Now, just take a seat.

01:54:48.223 --> 01:54:53.251
We wanted you to hear this.
Control, could you repeat directions?

01:54:53.462 --> 01:54:56.556
269, descend and maintain 3000,
heading 160...

01:54:56.798 --> 01:54:59.790
...if Connie will have dinner with me.

01:55:00.035 --> 01:55:01.730
Oh, jeez.

01:55:02.637 --> 01:55:06.368
- Or you're 23rd in line for landing.
- What?

01:55:07.909 --> 01:55:09.706
We gotta talk, Connie.

01:55:11.379 --> 01:55:15.713
- Just press the button.
- I'm not gonna fight with you.

01:55:15.917 --> 01:55:20.581
I wake up in an empty house,
and I hear you and the kids.

01:55:20.789 --> 01:55:23.622
I know you're not there, but I hear you.

01:55:23.825 --> 01:55:27.625
I can't work. I can't concentrate.
I can't sleep.

01:55:27.829 --> 01:55:32.630
- I look at the scopes and see you.
- Could you confirm our heading?

01:55:32.834 --> 01:55:35.894
Not until I finish.
Have dinner with me.

01:55:36.104 --> 01:55:37.628
Nick, I'm not...

01:55:39.274 --> 01:55:40.741
No.

01:55:41.343 --> 01:55:43.834
Lunch at Enzo's, Thursday.

01:55:44.112 --> 01:55:46.637
Come on, lunch at Enzo's.

01:55:46.848 --> 01:55:48.645
Coffee?

01:55:49.985 --> 01:55:51.418
I can't Thursday.

01:55:52.087 --> 01:55:53.850
Friday?

01:55:54.789 --> 01:55:58.850
- I don't know.
- "I don't know" is good. That's fine.

01:55:59.594 --> 01:56:03.428
- I've never heard him talk like this.
- He needs you.

01:56:04.166 --> 01:56:07.533
Please, just coffee? Give it a chance?

01:56:23.218 --> 01:56:26.051
Return to me

01:56:26.254 --> 01:56:29.246
Oh, my dear, I'm so lonely

01:56:29.991 --> 01:56:33.427
Hurry back, hurry back, hurry back

01:56:33.628 --> 01:56:37.223
Oh, my love, I am yours

01:56:37.432 --> 01:56:42.563
Return to me
For my heart wants you only

01:56:43.838 --> 01:56:46.102
Hurry home, hurry home

01:56:46.308 --> 01:56:51.211
Won't you please hurry home
I am yours

01:56:51.413 --> 01:56:55.907
My darling
If I hurt you I'm sorry

01:56:56.084 --> 01:57:00.885
Forgive me
And please say you are mine

01:57:05.193 --> 01:57:07.559
Ritorna me

01:57:07.796 --> 01:57:12.392
Cara mia ti amo

01:57:12.567 --> 01:57:15.001
Solo tu, solo tu

01:57:15.203 --> 01:57:17.068
Solo tu

01:57:17.272 --> 01:57:19.934
Mio cuore

01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:22.904
Mio cuore

01:57:26.348 --> 01:57:31.684
Thank you, captain. Runway 4 left
cleared ILS, contact tower 118.3.

01:57:32.254 --> 01:57:35.883
Connie, I've been thinking
about this a lot.

01:57:36.091 --> 01:57:38.753
My mind, it's like a broken computer.

01:57:38.960 --> 01:57:41.929
- You take...
- Nick, would you quit talking?

01:57:42.130 --> 01:57:43.791
What can you do?

01:57:44.032 --> 01:57:47.866
- It takes a good beating...
- You're losing me.

01:57:48.069 --> 01:57:52.563
- I think I'm ready.
- Nick, quit with the talking okay?

01:57:52.774 --> 01:57:55.242
You're right. I know.
Okay.
